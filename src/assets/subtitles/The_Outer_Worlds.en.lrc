[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.05]Good afternoon.
[00:02.85]How are you?
[00:04.15]Good to see you.
[00:06.52]Welcome to another broadcast.
[00:09.04]This is broadcast number 862.
[00:12.06]Thanks for joining me.
[00:20.15]We're almost at that thousand.
[00:21.57]We'll be there soon.
[00:22.85]We're almost at that thousand.
[00:27.61]And then just like Y2K, when we cross over from 999 to 1000, the whole stream ends forever.
[00:39.72]Because I don't know what the fuck to do.
[00:48.72]It just goes back to zero.
[00:50.32]So I have to start a new channel and go from zero again.
[00:59.35]That's fair.
[00:59.83]Now, how you guys doing?
[01:03.40]We got a lot of things.
[01:05.32]We got a lot of things to talk about.
[01:06.72]I mean, like, seriously.
[01:09.36]There's too many things for us to discuss.
[01:13.56]So, where do we start?
[01:17.98]Let's start... Let me, like, not be fucking 70.
[01:20.61]Okay.
[01:21.07]Okay.
[01:28.11]So first things first.
[01:30.95]As of tomorrow, there's going to be a green screen discussion night.
[01:36.46]No, not a night.
[01:37.10]A green screen discussion channel in the Discord.
[01:40.64]And there will also be a green screen actions channel.
[01:43.00]They're coming back.
[01:45.88]This is as of later tonight or tomorrow night.
[01:48.74]It'll be there.
[01:49.76]It's going to be there.
[01:52.03]As of the second week of December...
[01:54.78]I'm getting back in the studio.
[01:56.46]So that is now actually happening.
[01:58.14]That is set in stone to be the... Somewhere in the second week of December.
[02:02.98]I'll give you the date when I get it.
[02:06.04]So that will be there.
[02:08.33]Please get a better camera this time.
[02:11.31]Don't worry.
[02:13.41]The first one was just a test to see if it was fun to do.
[02:18.01]The second one I'm going to have... I'll actually have a better camera.
[02:21.07]And it'll be better footage to use.
[02:25.79]I'm pogging so hard right now.
[02:27.49]Well, hold your breath.
[02:30.15]Because only a few days after that.
[02:34.97]So let's say that that's somewhere between December 9th and December 12th or whatever.
[02:42.84]Hopefully, somewhere around the 15th of December is going to be the Minecraft Fuck the King stream.
[02:54.18]That is, we're shooting for December 15th.
[03:00.06]Dude, my breath is held.
[03:01.80]You can exhale now.
[03:05.93]Repeat everything you just said.
[03:07.05]I didn't hear it.
[03:09.67]Well, just wait like an hour when this stream goes into my videos tab and I'm still broadcasting, but you can like catch up on the last hour and a half and just watch the very beginning.
[03:21.90]Explain the Minecraft stream.
[03:23.88]Not yet.
[03:25.91]Because there's a ton of moving parts on this stream.
[03:31.06]That I need to have real details before I start throwing out bullshit.
[03:37.58]I don't want to just completely talk nonsense.
[03:40.34]I want it to be real, real, real info.
[03:43.28]So I'm not at that point yet.
[03:45.86]But it's being developed at this current moment.
[03:51.78]We're in the pre-alpha stage of trying to figure out how everything's going to work.
[03:57.03]But we're trying to do it for the 15th.
[04:01.29]That's announcement number two.
[04:02.20]Announcement number three.
[04:04.00]So you get the good stuff out first.
[04:05.78]Right?
[04:06.12]That's in my opinion.
[04:08.24]You get the good things out there first.
[04:10.52]This week.
[04:12.67]What pog?
[04:13.15]What pog?
[04:13.79]What fucking green screen DLC for free pog?
[04:15.99]That's like December fucking like 10th.
[04:18.19]What?
[04:19.07]Minecraft stream.
[04:20.53]The huge.
[04:21.41]That's happening like three days later.
[04:23.28]I'm going to be streaming not very much this week.
[04:28.73]I have another endoscopy that I have to do this week.
[04:32.89]And Thanksgiving is this week as well.
[04:36.10]So these streams are going to be shaved.
[04:40.68]I'm still streaming the next three days in a row.
[04:43.50]But we're going to be shaving these streams.
[04:48.83]Because of Thanksgiving and because I have to start to prepare Physically and mentally for a second endoscopy so The week of Thanksgiving is a full of stuff.
[05:01.72]So these next three streams are only gonna be Like four or five hours long each.
[05:07.21]I'm still streaming every day.
[05:08.49]I'm gonna be streaming on Thanksgiving too, but only for about four or five hours So There you go
[05:21.42]Yeah, and well, and it's... I'm not doing... I did a colonoscopy a few months ago.
[05:26.42]This is a... we're going... instead of up, we're going down.
[05:32.35]So this is going into my mouth and throat, down into my stomach, down into my other digestive places.
[05:39.87]So, still a pain in the ass.
[05:45.68]Stop talking.
[05:46.52]What?
[05:48.17]What do you mean, why did I say that?
[05:51.38]That's what it is.
[05:52.18]That is what the procedure is.
[05:55.24]They put a... That's a medical procedure.
[06:01.31]What, I can't explain what medical procedure this is?
[06:06.73]It's medicine.
[06:10.58]I don't want to hear it.
[06:12.77]Anyways, so let's use the time wisely.
[06:16.79]I'm going to be starting Outer Worlds today.
[06:20.55]And that's probably what we're going to do for the next few streams.
[06:27.96]Can you stream your endoscopy live on Twitch?
[06:30.16]We already made that joke like three months ago.
[06:34.24]But let's get to it.
[06:36.98]Because I want to utilize the time here.
[06:42.10]when's Jerma rumble 2019 a lot of stuff going on a lot of stuff going on December let me just tell you December is going to be full of stuff because the green screen stream the fuck the king streams because there's going to be multiple streams I'm not just doing that once it's going to be too outrageous

[07:15.78]And the Jerma Rumble.
[07:20.22]December is going to be a month of working.
[07:23.23]There's going to be a lot of stuff there.
[07:28.43]You might not want to use 2020.
[07:30.03]That's kind of... I don't know.
[07:33.32]Maybe we'll do the same thing we did last time.
[07:35.72]Rumble confirmed.
[07:37.75]Yeah, the rumble might actually look you The rumble might actually have to be like Delayed to January like eighth Just pretend it was it did stuck.

[08:33.84]They take your time to make it amazing.
[08:36.22]I don't want to have a scenario where just because, oh, I got this other stuff going on in December, but I've got to have the rumble in December.
[08:47.25]Just get it out.
[08:48.69]No, no, no, no.
[08:50.87]I want to put love into those things.
[08:53.46]So if it works, it works.
[08:55.04]And if it doesn't, then it's going to be pushed off.
[09:02.31]Each rumble and each wrestling card event that I've done over the last three, four years, I've had a ton of fun making them, and I've really loved them.

[09:24.97]Thanks for joining me on this week of...
[09:32.26]uh Thanksgiving and endoscopy back to back here we go uh story you can't even hear it you still can't enter use this mode if you enjoy story more than combat in story mode enemies have a less health and do less damage
[09:52.90]You can tell that this is actually hard when Supernova has patch notes.
[10:15.86]If you reduce difficulty, you cannot re-enable.
[10:18.74]Enemies have more health and deal more damage.
[10:21.24]You must eat, drink, and sleep to survive.
[10:24.84]Companions can die permanently.
[10:26.16]Crippled body and limb conditions can only be healed with bed rest.
[10:28.92]Weapons and armor work very poorly at zero durability.
[10:31.48]This is... You can only fast travel to your ship.
[10:36.04]You can only manually save while inside your ship.
[10:38.46]No.
[10:40.44]I'm just... I'm just gonna do normal.
[10:48.74]Move cursor in the right spot.
[10:50.30]Uh-oh.

[11:09.81]I know.
[11:10.33]I know.
[11:10.59]Don't look at my settings.
[11:18.08]Still doing it, isn't it?
[11:21.88]Why is this even... Why is this even possible?
[11:23.99]It doesn't make any sense.
[11:27.49]What the fuck?
[11:34.49]What the fuck is this doing?
[11:36.78]Hold on.
[11:39.76]Scale resolution.
[11:43.42]To...
[11:45.51]Why is this scaling to 1536 by 864?
[11:47.33]What?
[11:47.97]What the fuck is happening?
[12:00.06]Is that in the right spot?
[12:10.07]Alright, it's in the right spot now, but... What did I just do to the resolution?
[12:23.78]Did anything change?
[12:24.60]No, now it's like, fucked up again.
[12:31.70]Okay.
[12:33.68]I have no idea.
[12:39.81]Just move on?
[12:40.75]I kinda can't.
[12:41.59]Hold on, why would this even be happening?
[12:54.77]Okay, now it's like, it's fixed, but it's too big.
[13:05.49]What the fuck is happening?
[13:07.31]Alright, I think it's ready to go.
[13:13.92]Right?
[13:16.95]Game sucks.
[13:17.77]No, it's not game sucks.
[13:19.65]It's Streamlabs OBS sucks.
[13:22.21]And I say this every fucking stream.
[13:24.15]Why do I still use this?
[13:25.65]What's the, why do I keep using this?
[13:30.09]Am I, am I like a next level Omega Lazy where I won't just uninstall this program?
[13:40.70]I had regular OBS and it worked just fucking fine.
[13:45.12]Why do I have this program?
[13:48.64]There's one feature on it that's actually good.
[13:51.56]And all the other ones suck.
[13:54.28]I need to stop being so fucking hyper omega lazy.
[13:57.47]Alright, I can't get upset.
[13:59.67]Alright, back to what we were talking about before.
[14:11.54]Normal or hard?
[14:12.62]Fuck.
[14:13.49]Why would that even happen?
[14:17.11]Normal's too easy?
[14:18.49]Hard?
[14:19.05]I'll do hard.
[14:19.59]Alright, hard.
[14:20.33]Hard.
[14:22.04]Subtitles on, subtitles on, subtitles on.
[14:23.80]Sure, let's go.
[14:27.00]Alright, here we go.
[14:30.49]Like the scaling is just bugged out.
[14:32.77]Why stay earthbound when prosperity awaits you in the stars?
[14:36.37]Come to Halcyon, the only colony on the edge of the frontier owned and operated by corporations.
[14:42.44]A trip of 10 short years will feel like mere minutes thanks to the comfort and safety of your very own hibernation chamber.
[14:49.46]You'll wake up in a perfect society designed to maximize your productivity with guaranteed full employment.
[14:55.88]With only a minor term of service, you will become the master of your own destiny when you go out of this world to the Halcyon Colony.
[15:05.01]Top secret.
[15:05.55]10-23-23-20.
[15:05.87]Incident report.
[15:07.67]Colony ship Hope found drifting.
[15:09.59]Colonists.
[15:10.15]Something happened.
[15:11.29]Hope to be left at edge of colony.
[15:12.83]Top secret.
[15:16.07]Alert.
[15:16.47]Breach of Hope security corridor.
[15:18.29]Unidentified ship.
[15:22.67]I got Frank's Red Hot down there.
[15:25.70]Awesome.
[15:26.91]We can put it on everything.
[15:27.81]It's delicious.
[15:38.52]I saw the video.
[15:39.46]I saw the video.
[15:40.70]That's for the person that made that video.
[15:42.75]That's for you.
[15:51.37]That is fugitive, wanted by Halcyon.
[15:53.89]So this is a which-one-are-you scenario, right?
[16:20.67]Alright, here we go.
[16:21.97]Attributes.
[16:23.19]Body, strength, dexterity, mind, perception, personality.
[16:26.09]Okay, here we go.
[16:27.57]How many points do I get?
[16:28.55]Alright.
[16:31.33]Let's do this... Let's do this the way that it should be, okay?
[16:38.02]Temperament.
[16:40.38]And you can see what it does on the right, okay.
[16:42.76]Temperament improves your natural health regeneration.
[16:47.93]Max your strength out.
[16:49.21]Okay, strength affects melee weapon.
[16:51.07]Do I want to be melee or do I want to be ranged?
[16:53.30]Attack speed and ranged weapon reload speed.
[17:00.88]And the amount you can carry.
[17:02.18]One-handed melee, two-handed melee, heavy weapons, block, inspiration, and intimidate.
[17:06.39]And you can carry more.
[17:07.25]Okay, intelligence is...
[17:12.56]Long guns persuade, hack medical science and determination.
[17:16.64]Perception is handguns.
[17:17.88]Long guns, heavy weapons.
[17:21.06]Dodge, lockpick, and engineering.
[17:24.60]You need to be low IQ.
[17:28.38]Well, not that low.
[17:29.48]Okay, I don't want this to be a stream where we laugh every time I open a dialog box because I can't even function.
[17:36.40]Is that possible?
[17:39.07]Low IQ, high melee.
[17:43.02]Next.
[17:44.70]Did you just next?
[17:45.40]Did I just get nexted?
[17:49.14]In the game?
[17:49.64]The game crashed.
[17:54.79]Where's my mouse?
[18:00.15]What the fuck?
[18:01.07]Oh, okay, that was weird.
[18:02.80]I almost got forced into another game.
[18:05.37]Alright, let's do... Charm.
[18:08.12]Charm affects faction reputation and companion ability cooldowns.
[18:10.94]Persuade, lie, intimidate, hack... I mean, come on.
[18:21.58]That's pretty good.
[18:22.26]I'm pretty good at lying.
[18:25.02]And I'm very good at inspiring.
[18:26.95]Companion ability refresh, positive faction reputation, negative faction reputation reactions.
[18:33.02]Alright, temperament.
[18:34.66]Below average.
[18:36.84]Oh, I get points for doing that, okay.
[18:41.09]I mean, I'm kind of hot-headed.
[18:49.35]Uh... But health regen, that sucks.
[18:54.42]Having no health regen?
[18:57.28]No, I'm good.
[18:58.92]No, that's too much of a charm.
[19:01.35]Alright, strength.
[19:01.85]Let's do... I think I want to use guns, though.
[19:07.93]Like, handguns.
[19:08.95]Isn't that cool?
[19:09.89]Heavy weapons and handguns?
[19:18.11]No.
[19:19.49]Temperament is a dumb stat.
[19:23.37]Yeah, I'm doing... I want to do heavy weapons.
[19:26.48]No, I want to do, like, handguns.
[19:27.92]I want to be, like, a revolver spinner.
[19:36.15]I got pretty good dexterity in real life.
[19:40.93]Okay.
[19:42.87]One-handed melee.
[19:44.63]These are... One-handed melee.
[19:46.05]I can still do melee.
[19:46.91]One-handed melee.
[19:47.53]I want weapon reload.
[19:52.62]You've seen me play the connector.
[19:53.90]I can move around real fast.
[19:54.92]Hmm.
[20:00.82]I'll have to use smaller words around you.
[20:05.79]long guns I don't really care but minus 20 critical strike damage that's terrible you took a few blows to the brain pan this is below okay below average does not mean idiot it's I can't go lower than that if you're below average intelligence that doesn't mean you speak in one word sentences
[20:37.32]I think that's alright.
[20:40.66]Charismatic enough for the bits.
[20:42.57]He's already... You got... This guy's already got me figured out.
[20:44.85]Alright, I want one-handed melee and handguns.
[20:51.89]There we go.
[20:52.37]I got perception.
[20:54.03]Extra headshots.
[20:58.14]And... I can charm you.
[21:00.98]I might not be that intelligent, but... Is that really gonna give me stupid dialog options?
[21:08.34]Alright, let's go.
[21:09.08]I'm sticking with it.
[21:11.94]Oh, shit.
[21:12.61]Okay.
[21:14.29]One-handed melee.
[21:16.23]Range defense dialog.
[21:21.79]Low IQ cowboy.
[21:23.31]Yeah.
[21:26.75]Well, to be fair, I don't know, education wasn't the most important fucking thing back in the cowboy times.
[21:34.12]Back in the fucking, like, saloon times.
[21:41.18]That's a lie?
[21:41.78]Was that a lie?
[21:43.28]Okay, that's a lie.
[21:48.86]Persuade.
[21:50.16]Humans have a 20% chance to cower in fear for three seconds after the first time you hit them.
[21:58.50]15% chance auto... auto-mechanicals will slowly attack other enemies instead of you.
[22:10.60]Alright, handguns.
[22:14.23]Unlock TTD location hit effects.
[22:19.01]87.9% handgun crit chance and handgun sway.
[22:21.91]Alright, yep.
[22:22.81]I like it.
[22:29.98]Sneak.
[22:30.78]Oh, I can't.
[22:31.56]I'm not sneaky.
[22:32.22]Alright, let's go.
[22:34.20]That sounds alright.
[22:35.02]Handgun and one-handed weapons.
[22:38.02]And lined people.
[22:40.15]Aptitude.
[22:40.67]Aye, aye, aye.
[22:44.43]Colonists sounded like a nice entry-level career for a person of your skill.
[22:50.82]Expanding humanity's reach by civilizing the cosmic frontier.
[22:55.34]Was ambitious enough without worrying about your day job.
[22:57.52]You have the rest of your life to decide how you'd be useful in Halcyon.
[23:02.49]Determination.
[23:03.05]What does determination do?
[23:03.85]Beverage service technician.
[23:07.65]Drink effect duration plus 3%.
[23:10.54]Bureaucrat.
[23:12.28]Cashier, subgrade, non-supervisory.
[23:17.17]Construction, electrician class, wire spooler.
[23:21.59]Elevator operations specialist.
[23:26.27]Is this the person that's in the elevator that's pressing the buttons to go up and down floors and say, like, have a nice day?
[23:31.59]Or is this the person that made the elevator?
[23:34.27]Oh, it is the person that, okay.
[23:38.13]A proper lift goes up and down.
[23:39.49]Anyone who thinks otherwise isn't fit to wear the badge.
[23:42.23]Being a specialist means something where you come from.
[23:44.67]Commitment to upward and downward mobility.
[23:47.09]Well, that could mean anything.
[23:49.48]That could mean that you're like the expert button pusher.
[23:52.88]Factory worker dodge plus one.
[23:55.24]Farmer dirt.
[23:58.10]You got into this business for the tubers.
[24:02.19]But you stayed for the plowing.
[24:05.91]Planting, pruning, and plucking.
[24:08.57]It is an honest work if you come home clean.
[24:10.61]Worms need dirt and food needs worms.
[24:12.71]You're just doing your part for the worms.
[24:16.57]I got into this business for the tubers.
[24:19.48]N ray damage received minus 3%.
[24:21.06]What is N?
[24:23.22]Is that like...
[24:26.64]Is that, uh, like, radiation in, like, you know, radiation?
[24:34.82]Food additive tester.
[24:38.02]Sometimes quality control means sampling a delicious borscht smoothie.
[24:44.53]Janitor sanitation class.
[24:47.93]Tossball team mascot.
[24:49.65]Okay, that's, I would probably do that.
[24:52.69]There isn't a problem in all the cosmos that team spirit and a big stick couldn't solve together.
[24:56.33]Your last major head injury in the field knocked some extra cheer into you, and you've been a rising star in the Tossball's competitive mascot food chain ever since.
[25:04.66]Doesn't matter, no one knows your face under the mask.
[25:07.48]You share the glory with the team.
[25:10.41]Now's your chance to have vengeance.
[25:13.37]Good.
[25:14.33]Medical technician.
[25:15.47]Nah.
[25:16.30]Safety inspector.
[25:17.20]Who cares?
[25:18.16]Scientist assistant level zero.
[25:20.30]No.
[25:21.34]A sub sous chef.
[25:23.68]Ooh.
[25:24.18]How many of these can I have?
[25:25.24]Just one?
[25:25.54]Just one?
[25:25.80]Inspiration.
[25:26.10]Dirt farmer.
[25:26.48]But...
[25:43.33]Yeah, that's more accurate.
[25:44.45]Alright, that's more accurate.
[25:57.41]How detailed is this?
[26:07.38]I got huge eyebrow bones.
[26:08.62]I'm just making me.
[26:18.94]Am I eyes big?
[26:23.73]No.
[26:27.19]Here's something about making yourself in a character creator.
[26:29.73]Everybody can relate to this.
[26:30.75]I know you can.
[26:32.37]If there are people watching you make yourself in a character creator, and you make yourself look wicked good,
[26:41.62]You almost feel like you're being judged by everybody.
[26:43.46]Like, dude, okay, you don't... You're not, like, come on.
[26:45.90]Like, you got, like, that chin like that, like, chiseled like that.
[26:48.60]It's like, oh, uh... Yeah, it looks like me, I think.
[26:53.32]And when you make other people in the room.
[26:55.75]You ever have that problem?
[26:57.17]Yeah, oh, make me next!
[26:58.33]Make me next!
[26:58.93]And you're like, oh, yeah, okay, man.
[27:00.33]And you look over, oh.
[27:02.37]I mean, you're... You're, like...
[27:07.13]No, I can't do that, because you have kind of a small mouth, but I can't... I don't want you to know that.
[27:14.11]So I'm just going to do this.
[27:15.92]Right here.
[27:16.28]This is normal.
[27:18.64]No, you're just... Everything is normal.
[27:21.40]Everything about you is completely and totally fucking normal, dude.
[27:25.47]Like, your nose is big, but...
[27:30.14]Everything is completely fine.
[27:31.56]That's you.
[27:32.72]I can't.
[27:35.88]I know they have the same... That's why I leave the room when they're making me.
[27:39.74]Oh, it's your turn to make me.
[27:41.46]Ah, you know what?
[27:42.62]I gotta use the bathroom.
[27:43.73]And I'll just leave for 20 minutes.
[27:45.75]So then they don't feel pressured.
[27:48.69]And then they go, okay, that's what his face looks like.
[27:50.39]That's what his eyes look like.
[27:53.01]Alright, let's go.
[27:54.67]What was I doing with this?
[27:56.67]I'm gonna try to make me, this is what I think I look like.
[27:59.38]But you can't, it's impossible to do that.
[28:07.96]No, I'm doing it to myself!
[28:11.23]I'm doing the thing I just told you about to myself.
[28:14.05]Because I know you're watching.
[28:21.41]Does my moat, my moat doesn't go that far down, no.
[28:24.90]I do have a fairly large nose.
[28:29.09]I know that to be the case.
[28:30.33]But it's not like bulbous.
[28:50.79]It's big, but it's also thin at the same time.
[28:54.41]I have a really weird nose.
[28:55.73]And it goes sideways.
[29:07.63]Oh, this is not that... It really is not that detailed.
[29:09.49]You're right.
[29:34.17]No, I don't know.
[29:35.71]I can't do it.
[29:36.33]I have to leave the room for 20 minutes.
[29:37.77]You guys have to make me.
[29:43.67]It's an FPS.
[29:44.51]Who cares?
[29:48.33]I do.
[29:59.78]This doesn't look fucking anything like me.
[30:13.91]This is like Woody Harrelson.
[30:18.09]Alright, let's go.
[30:19.35]Whatever.
[30:19.75]I mean, I guess I kind of do look a little... I could be like Woody Harrelson's nephew.
[30:29.75]I could be.
[30:42.33]Somewhere.
[30:45.91]Alright, here we go.
[30:46.61]Let's move on.
[30:47.31]Name.
[30:48.11]Oh, this is important.
[30:48.90]This is such a bad character.
[30:50.50]This is like... This is that AI-created, this-person-doesn't-exist algorithm.
[30:57.82]Alright, name.
[31:19.79]That's not what Junko looks like.
[31:27.89]Dirtman?
[31:28.71]I'm just gonna be Junko.
[31:34.99]Who fucking gives a shit?
[31:38.98]Next.
[31:42.46]Skills.
[31:44.02]Alright, we got handguns is 30.
[31:46.14]One-handed ma- 13?! !
[31:51.77]Dodge.
[31:53.89]Persuade.
[31:54.71]Lie.
[31:55.13]This guy kind of sucks.
[31:57.88]He just lies.
[32:01.14]I'm just the side goblin character.
[32:05.82]I'm not an actual protagonist.
[32:12.70]Oh well.
[32:17.27]Alright, let's play.
[32:19.05]Oh, look at you.
[32:19.80]You're lucky.
[32:23.90]Great Scott.
[32:24.50]You're lucky day, my friend.
[32:42.85]Bro, I fucking love Rick and Morty.
[32:44.55]It's season 4, it's incoming.
[32:59.10]Damn, the internet did a full 180 on Rick and Morty.
[33:02.42]Like, it was, internet loved Rick and Morty, and then internet fucking hated Rick and Morty.
[33:06.78]All it took was a McDonald's sauce for everyone to hate that show.
[33:28.97]It's gonna happen to you
[33:33.17]Hey, I've been around almost 10 years.
[33:36.14]This is season 10.
[33:37.06]Ah, there you are.
[33:38.84]Wondering what's going on, eh?
[33:40.58]Bit of bad news there, I'm afraid.
[33:42.32]Your colony ship was inexplicably knocked out of skip space and forced to complete its journey at sublight speeds.
[33:50.31]This means that you and every other college to help have been in suspended animation for 70 years, give or take.
[33:58.60]normally reviving someone after so long leads to some quite horrifying results it's called explosive cell death but it's really more Jerm is going to turn into The Simpsons eventually no I'll just quit oh yes well not to worry I've pumped your body full of a special concoction I devised to keep you from dying so horrifically hopefully at all but I guess we'll see yes
[34:23.68]Unfortunately, I used the last of my chemical supplies saving you.
[34:27.38]I know it's a lot to ask, but I must have your help securing more if we're to save the rest of your fellow colonists.
[34:36.27]I'd see it done myself, of course, but the board has a sizable bounty on my head.
[34:40.71]Now, my ship is inoperative, but I've managed to hire a smuggler to help you out.
[34:48.17]Oh, I see we're in position.
[34:50.50]Good luck.
[34:52.27]Alright, it's time.
[34:57.06]Any NPC can die.
[34:58.37]It's a good thing he got out of my way.
[35:02.51]Because he would have been the first.
[35:12.98]so funny xd I'm lulling so hard is this thing working relax there you are now where were we oh yes a smuggler his name is hawthorne and he should be waiting for you at the landing site he's to be your uh chauffeur so to speak not to worry I'm told he's a specialist dashing Gunslinger one of a kind ship of that sort of thing you like him I'm sure
[35:37.52]I've also outfitted you with a simple wireless monitor so I can track your progress.
[35:42.58]I'll check in with you as soon as you land.
[35:45.58]Good luck.
[35:46.64]I'm all the colonists are counting on you.
[35:52.22]Let's land on Earth.
[35:58.21]Hold up sport.
[36:04.67]You guys need to relax.
[36:13.04]We're not even, like, 15 minutes into the game.
[36:17.18]Ah, you've landed good!
[36:18.76]Hawthorne should be close by.
[36:22.30]What in law's name?
[36:24.18]Is that him?
[36:24.84]Wait, he's dead?
[36:25.52]Oh, that idiot.
[36:27.22]I told him to plant the beacon and move away, not stand there holding it.
[36:31.53]Oh well, no sense in letting his ship go to waste.
[36:35.83]I was gonna say I can walk, but I can't.
[36:37.75]Hawthorne won't mind you taking his ship.
[36:39.91]Better you than the board, huh?
[36:42.50]Not sure I trusted the fellow.
[36:44.52]Might have gone after the bounty on my head.
[36:46.10]Shame about the whole squashing thing.
[36:49.89]Nasty way to go.
[36:50.79]Hmm.
[36:52.79]Spacebar jump over obstacles.
[36:55.69]Interesting.
[36:56.19]Can't even see my feet.
[36:57.21]This game belongs in the trash can.
[36:59.85]I can't even see my feet walking.
[37:01.65]Game should be deleted.
[37:03.33]A sprat.
[37:09.33]Whoa.
[37:10.81]Whoa!
[37:12.59]I gotta react to this!
[37:15.07]It's like a lizard!
[37:16.58]Okay.
[37:25.36]Sprint is... Do I have to hold it?
[37:26.66]No.
[37:29.73]Is it like loot that I'm gonna miss or something?
[37:33.99]Second dead NPC.
[37:36.53]I was already here.
[37:39.54]Okay, while sneaking, use tall grass, rocks, and other cover to hide from enemies.
[37:42.72]Use this to sneak past enemies or sneak up to them and initiate combat.
[37:47.80]Alright, Adreno.
[37:57.45]What the hell is that?
[37:59.13]The awareness meters over enemy heads tell you if they are unaware, suspicious, investigating, or alerted.
[38:03.95]Alright.
[38:05.37]Alright.
[38:13.02]So just hide.
[38:14.27]Oh, that's the awareness meter.
[38:17.97]Got it.
[38:18.79]Just sneak around.
[38:19.71]Did I just get spotted?
[38:22.87]Did I get spotted in the tutorial?
[38:25.87]Whatever.
[38:26.19]Alright, path to ship.
[38:34.92]Let's keep going.
[38:36.80]What's going on?
[38:41.14]The game looks pretty good.
[38:51.97]It's one of those games, though, and I'm already going to give it a criticism, but this is just a personal preference.
[38:57.38]Only personal preference.
[38:58.66]This is not actually meant as a game sucks mentality.
[39:02.02]It's a...
[39:04.90]It reminds me of the way that Wildstar looked.
[39:07.32]And I didn't like that style.
[39:08.84]It hurt my head.
[39:10.22]What did Ephes heal?
[39:21.02]Oh.
[39:24.98]NPC.
[39:26.46]The second I have an opportunity.
[39:28.91]You've tried the best now.
[39:31.40]Now try the rest.
[39:32.51]Spacer's Choice.
[39:33.79]Oh, wow, that stings.
[39:36.49]Medical 5.
[39:36.79]Sit still, I'll patch you up.
[39:38.45]What happened to you?
[39:39.45]Spacer's what?
[39:41.53]See, I'm not speaking in one sentence dialog options.
[39:44.75]Do I have Medical 5?
[39:51.34]Looks like the bleeding stopped.
[39:53.16]I owe you one.
[39:54.52]Hope you don't mind me omitting this little exchange for my report.
[39:57.74]Spacer's Choice doesn't like us accepting outside help.
[40:01.97]How are you feeling?
[40:02.53]What happened to you?
[40:03.29]Did I just heal him to kill him?
[40:05.91]I want you to feel good.
[40:07.01]I want you to be able to fight back.
[40:12.58]How are you feeling?
[40:13.44]What happened to you?
[40:14.00]Hmm.
[40:14.44]Hmm.
[40:31.83]What's this about marauders?
[40:33.39]What are you doing out here?
[40:34.53]You're hiding in a cave and you blocked off the exit.
[40:36.59]You're as good as dead.
[40:38.03]Spacer's choice policy clearly stipulates that dead and as good as dead are two completely different properties of matter.
[40:44.49]Unless I'm dead, I'm contractually obligated to attend to my post.
[40:48.47]I will report that illegally grounded spacecraft if it is the last thing I do.
[40:52.85]See those canisters by the entrance?
[40:54.75]Marauders come sniffing around in here and I can take them all out with a single shot.
[40:59.15]Not bad, huh?
[41:06.41]I got a better idea.
[41:07.21]Give me your gun and I'll go get help.
[41:09.49]Someone grounded this ship illegally?
[41:11.05]Don't worry, I'll take care of them for you.
[41:13.19]You're an idiot.
[41:13.95]Give me your gun before you get yourself killed.
[41:21.43]I got a better idea.
[41:22.25]Give me your gun.
[41:23.73]Alright, give me your gun.
[41:26.36]I want that one, too.
[41:27.82]I've got Medical 5.
[41:28.56]I'll take it out.
[41:29.94]Where am I?
[41:51.35]Don't kill him.
[42:06.98]Mmm, okay.
[42:08.08]Do you know anything about The Hope?
[42:09.85]Let's get info.
[42:10.59]Alright, I'm off.
[42:11.11]Ooh, cool.
[42:35.58]Guard Pelham.
[42:37.16]Shoot.
[42:42.24]Alright, how do I get through this?
[42:52.63]I don't want to use this yet.
[42:55.43]Kill him.
[42:57.55]No.
[42:59.33]Not yet.
[43:01.43]He was useful to me.
[43:02.87]He gave me a gun.
[43:05.08]shoot it but if I don't want to should I shoot it I guess I'm damage my ears what just happened can you hear me what in the hell what what what their food
[43:39.63]Tactical time dilation.
[43:43.85]Due to complications stemming from being revived after an extended hibernation, your brain processes time differently.
[43:49.65]Pressing the tactical time dilation button slows down the world, giving you time to think as well as take action.
[43:57.27]So this is like the VAT system.
[43:59.39]You have a limited time in this mode.
[44:01.81]Standing still drains your TTD meter very slowly.
[44:06.36]While moving in attacks, drain it faster.
[44:08.58]The TTD meter refreshes slowly over time.
[44:11.98]Okay.
[44:12.70]So it is Q. Some objects explode when hit.
[44:20.75]Shoot them when enemies are nearby for an explosive surprise.
[44:23.03]Just don't be too close.
[44:23.91]Explosions can cause concussions.
[44:30.19]NPC?
[44:30.53]NPC?
[44:37.55]Alright, NPC... Alright, that's two NPCs dead.
[44:50.02]Double... Wait, what was it?
[44:51.84]Oh, there's a double jump?
[44:55.42]Space is like a dodge?
[44:56.40]Double jumping, uh... Double tapping is a dodge.
[45:01.29]Corpses and... I thought that was a fucking monster.
[45:03.08]Corpses and containers hold items that you can take.
[45:04.70]You can take them all.
[45:05.76]Take one or take them all.
[45:06.72]Okay.
[45:06.96]Mossville Squirrels.
[45:08.26]What do we got?
[45:09.54]Alright.
[45:09.92]Brew.
[45:12.30]Magpick.
[45:14.70]Just... I got... Bananas?
[45:17.86]Apples.
[45:18.54]Bananas.
[45:20.56]Hacking and picking locks.
[45:21.86]Your hacking and lockpick skills help you get into places you're not meant to be.
[45:26.14]Magpicks are used to break open locks and bypass shunts are used to break computer encryptions.
[45:32.76]I don't have a high enough skill.
[45:35.33]If your skill is high enough to break the security, you'll see how many magpicks or shunts you need and how long it will take.
[45:41.57]Raising your skill will lower the number of items used and speed up the process.
[45:45.93]So this is, okay, I can do this.
[45:49.09]Two seconds to pick this?
[45:52.99]Ooh.
[45:54.27]This is two-headed melee.
[45:55.79]I don't need... I don't do two-headed melee.
[45:59.45]You found a new weapon!
[46:00.59]The weapon button... The weapon switch button allows you to rotate between the weapons you've equipped on the inventory screen.
[46:07.19]Okay, so I have an inventory of fish sticks, bread, and sliced bread.
[46:11.33]Okay, whatever.
[46:12.11]I... How do I get the inventory?
[46:19.31]I...
[46:22.19]TNL weapon safety.
[46:23.15]Weapon management.
[46:23.97]You can have up to four weapons equipped at any time by dragging them up to the slots.
[46:28.13]Right.
[46:29.67]You can also inspect your weapons, compare them, flag them as junk, or break them down for parts.
[46:34.71]If you have an engineering skill, they can repair weapons on this screen.
[46:37.47]Take care of your TNL weapons and they'll take care of your enemies.
[46:39.95]Ooh, this is one-handed.
[46:45.13]Alright, this is 73 DPS.
[46:46.27]It's the same thing.
[46:47.61]What happened to my mouse?
[46:49.45]What's going on?
[46:49.91]What the fuck was that?
[46:54.13]Alright.
[46:54.79]Bleed.
[46:55.25]Bleed.
[46:55.45]Wait.
[46:55.81]Yeah.
[46:56.17]Just bring him up here.
[46:57.51]Scrap this one?
[46:58.75]Yeah.
[46:59.03]Scrap it.
[46:59.45]Break it down for parts.
[47:04.25]And break this one down for parts too.
[47:07.75]Good.
[47:12.39]That's a block.
[47:15.09]So is this a slash?
[47:17.73]Most melee weapons can do a three-swing combo.
[47:20.39]Okay.
[47:22.41]Cool.
[47:22.81]Let's go.
[47:41.82]I'm actually getting shot in the head and going, huh?
[47:44.34]Where did that come from?
[47:51.41]So that just slows down the time.
[47:52.95]Alright, I get... You've unlocked Leap.
[48:00.71]Double-click jump when moving forward to leap forward.
[48:02.91]Great for closing distances.
[48:04.06]Alright, did this guy drop anything?
[48:12.00]Alright.
[48:15.50]Would the other guy die?
[48:23.94]That's cool.
[48:25.42]Lag.
[48:26.52]Is my computer not good enough to handle this game in very high settings?
[48:29.34]I don't think it is.
[48:36.71]Wait, those are... They don't have... Okay.
[48:42.68]Hey!
[48:43.49]Get over here before you get yourself killed!
[48:51.57]Kill, kill, kill, no!
[48:52.17]Alright, let me be clear about something very, very quickly.
[48:54.89]This is my ship that we're talking about, right?
[48:58.71]That's mine.
[48:59.23]Right, okay.
[49:21.34]Uh, so, it's just a landing violation.
[49:23.06]Let it go.
[49:23.46]So, I heard, I found one of your teammates holed up in a cave.
[49:25.91]No.
[49:26.83]That guy, whatever.
[49:27.49]Who cares about that guy?
[49:28.71]I've already dealt with a few of these marauders.
[49:30.21]Not impressed.
[49:30.93]It's just a, let it go.
[49:31.69]It's a landing violation.
[49:32.23]Hmm.
[49:48.48]Do Spaces Choice Guards back down from a challenge?
[49:50.74]I bet you could get these marauders to tell you where the owner of that ship is.
[49:54.94]Guess I'll have to give you a zero on my customer satisfaction survey.
[49:59.70]Don't worry, you sit tight, I'll handle it.
[50:02.12]Looks like I'm gonna have to give you a zero.
[50:04.80]Your fucking LinkedIn account, your Yelp review.
[50:08.34]Seriously?
[50:09.78]But those marauders will... You know what?
[50:14.51]You're right.
[50:15.89]It's time we cross those marauders off, find whoever owns that ship, and file a full report.
[50:21.75]Then it's going to be fucking laminated.
[50:23.64]I swear.
[50:25.12]Here we go.
[50:41.55]But they have armor.
[50:42.95]I just turned to find bonus.
[50:45.18]If I attack, they have armor.
[50:47.22]I'm gonna get destroyed.
[50:48.42]They have, like, rifles.
[50:53.75]They don't have armor on their head.
[50:55.03]It doesn't matter.
[50:58.41]They're gonna find out this is my ship.
[51:02.19]What do I do?
[51:02.63]They're gonna find out this is my ship.
[51:21.97]Do I have to hide the bodies?
[51:42.18]You can fast travel to locations you have unlocked by opening your map and selecting your destinations.
[51:48.09]Please be informed that this vessel contains no valuable plunder.
[51:51.85]Landing site discovered.
[51:53.17]This is not my ship.
[52:04.76]Oh.
[52:08.08]All doors are on security lockdown.
[52:10.74]Nice try, Marauder.
[52:14.72]Marauder, please be informed.
[52:15.67]The ship has no crew for you to murder.
[52:47.37]I should be looting this stuff, shouldn't I?
[52:51.05]Salmon fingers?
[52:54.11]Did I kill this?
[52:57.77]Where's the computer's brain?
[52:59.15]It's sealed.
[53:03.23]Well, let's just go this way.
[53:16.04]I can't do that?
[53:21.05]Smile for my surveillance device, Marauder.
[53:23.91]I am tracking your every move.
[53:26.59]Really?
[53:26.85]Oh, did they get me?
[53:30.04]Unauthorized access of spacefaring vessels is a crime.
[53:33.60]Please submit yourself to the authorities.
[53:36.33]Uh-oh.
[53:37.85]Uh-oh.
[53:38.43]Hello, Marauder.
[53:39.21]I am Ada, the autonomous digital astrogator of this vessel.
[53:44.25]Please be informed that I am authorized to use violent retribution against unwanted solicitors.
[53:49.67]Can you lie to computers?
[53:50.53]Please return any misappropriated equipment and exit this vessel in an orderly fashion.
[53:55.59]Failure to do so will result in your immediate destruction.
[53:59.09]Lies don't work on computers.
[54:00.90]They don't understand what that even means.
[54:03.48]It's binary.
[54:05.00]0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.
[54:07.46]They don't understand the nuances of telling fibs.
[54:11.24]How would they know that?
[54:14.33]I'm not here to misappropriate anything.
[54:15.93]I don't appreciate being talked to though.
[54:17.37]What are you going to do?
[54:18.25]Self-destruct?
[54:32.00]Great, I'm getting shot into space twice in one day.
[54:34.48]Is something supposed to be happening?
[54:39.57]You are still here.
[54:41.23]My deception protocols have failed.
[54:43.49]Oh, you think you can lie to me?
[54:44.75]Yeah, you can't lie.
[54:47.77]I told you computers can't fucking lie.
[54:49.07]I need to get this ship in the air.
[54:51.96]Is this Hawthorne?
[54:54.24]This vessel is the registered property of Captain Alex Hawthorne.
[54:58.74]That's me.
[54:59.28]I am incapable of accepting orders from anyone other than Captain Alex Hawthorne.
[55:05.95]Hawthorne was supposed to meet me when I landed.
[55:07.82]Hawthorne's dead, I'm sorry.
[55:09.46]Your captain's a red smear under my escape pod.
[55:13.02]I understand.
[55:13.74]I will require some time to process this information.
[55:18.94]Thank you for your patience and for your honesty.
[55:22.31]I am programmed to take orders exclusively from Captain Hawthorne.
[55:26.55]If I accept your orders, then you must be Captain Hawthorne.
[55:30.33]Do you understand?
[55:35.28]I get it.
[55:35.68]You need me to be Captain Hawthorne or you can't fly.
[55:38.28]Dumb nod and smile.
[55:39.68]Yes.
[55:40.44]Just... Okay.
[55:41.74]Oh, no.
[55:42.04]Where am I supposed to find something like that?
[55:45.03]I doubt I'll find a part like that just sitting in a garage.
[56:07.19]How could you be a dumb engineer?
[56:12.06]That kind of doesn't make any sense.
[56:18.85]astutely observed however the probability of locating a power regulator within a worker settlement follows with an acceptable parameters have you ever played man versus machine Jeremy power regulators are sometimes employed in the electrical networks of worker settlements I have taken the liberty of printing you a new captain's identity cartridge
[56:39.86]Please try not to lose it this time.
[56:42.47]This cartridge identifies you, Alex Hawthorne, as the registered proprietor and captain of the Unreliable.
[56:49.83]Do you understand?
[56:52.31]Yeah.
[56:55.05]Captain Hawthorne of the Unreliable.
[56:56.46]I like it.
[56:57.02]Knock it off with this Captain Hawthorne nonsense.
[56:59.34]No, I like it.
[57:00.12]Thank you.
[57:00.96]I appreciate your cooperation.
[57:03.32]Best of luck in your search for a power regulator.
[57:06.68]Try to stay alive this time.
[57:11.18]Too bad.
[57:19.88]Congratulations, you've gained enough experience to go on a level up.
[57:23.95]Character ledger to advance your character.
[57:26.39]Health points, points to upgrade your skills, give you access to new perks, keep leveling up in your build.
[57:31.61]Upper management in no time.
[57:33.33]Alright, let's see.
[57:36.77]Skill improvements.
[57:39.45]Every time you level up, you improve your skills.
[57:41.72]Spending a skill point on a core skill improves all the specialized skills in that group up to a maximum of 50.
[57:49.85]After 50, you can add points directly to specialized skills up to 100.
[57:53.49]So you can do core skills.
[57:54.81]That's interesting.
[57:57.19]Every skill improves as it grows, but special unlock bonuses occur every 20 points.
[58:01.03]Read each skill description to see what they are.
[58:03.59]Cool.
[58:04.83]These things, these things, and these things can temporarily raise and lower your skills.
[58:08.35]This helps or hurts skill checks and the skill's passive bonuses, but won't give or take away the skill unlocks.
[58:18.19]Whatever you say.
[58:20.01]Alright.
[58:20.95]10 points available.
[58:22.47]So we're gonna... Holy shit, that's a lot of points.
[58:26.23]Handguns.
[58:33.00]uh can I not welcome to perk selection you can choose which perks to buy with your perk points you get a new perk point every two levels yeah perks are cool and they affect gameplay oh man alright uh 20 sprint speed vendor prices base health oh that's a lot
[59:01.41]Fast travel when encumbered, that's huge.
[59:04.19]I feel like that's a big deal.
[59:14.02]Base armor rating.
[59:18.91]25% weapon armor durability loss, companion crit chance.
[59:22.65]I'm just gonna, let's play it safe.
[59:25.09]I'm just gonna do, I'm gonna do like speed or health.
[59:31.72]I'm going to say health.
[59:34.53]Yeah, I mean 50% base health.
[59:36.59]You can't go wrong there.
[59:39.63]Yeah, that's good.
[59:45.93]Skills.
[59:48.73]Okay.
[59:50.67]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[59:51.83]Go back.
[59:52.25]No, no, I wanted to do that.
[59:53.43]Right.
[59:54.01]Okay, you have to actually just click on these.
[59:55.61]31 up to 50.
[59:55.91]Dialog.
[60:00.72]I want to do that.
[60:03.72]Let's make sure we have 30 lying and 30 intimidate.
[60:11.23]Handguns.
[60:14.85]Yeah, I want to... Fuck it, yeah.
[60:24.10]Fuck it.
[60:26.34]Let's go.
[60:27.73]You've unlocked location hit effects for tactical time dilation.
[60:31.95]Hitting enemies in different locations during TTD maims or cripples those body parts.
[60:36.06]Try different locations, see what different effects happen.
[60:39.62]Hits to the chest produce different effects when using different weapons.
[60:42.02]Okay, cool.
[60:43.54]You've unlocked a dialog combat skill.
[60:46.54]When attacking the correct type of target, they are automatically debilitated.
[60:51.99]Dialog combat.
[60:56.69]Alright.
[61:00.04]Alright.
[61:01.48]I'm ready.
[61:02.14]Go find a part.
[61:22.09]I was about to headshot him.
[61:23.65]Oh, the guards.
[61:24.05]The guards?
[61:24.29]Yeah, the guards and I had a bit of an altercation, you see.
[61:48.12]The guards accidentally brutally shot themselves while on patrol.
[61:52.02]I don't like your... Yeah, they accidentally brutally shot themselves.
[61:55.61]Good.
[61:55.91]Okay.
[61:56.19]I could use their gear.
[61:58.49]No sense in letting a good suit of armor go to waste.
[62:01.79]Good idea.
[62:02.09]And clean up the ship while you're at it.
[62:26.11]Is that an official Spacer's Choice spacecraft on an official Spacer's Choice landing pad?
[62:31.79]Do I look like an auto-mechanical sanitation unit?
[62:35.15]The answer to both questions is no.
[62:38.48]You don't want to amble on over to Edgewater at your earliest convenience.
[62:41.86]The constable's office might have work for someone with your, let's just say, aggressive disposition.
[62:49.36]Oh, and be sure to stop by the Edgewater Provisioner for a can of salt tuna.
[62:54.02]It's not the best choice.
[62:55.60]It's Spacer's choice.
[62:57.20]Mm-hmm.
[62:59.64]Hang on, I want to ask you something.
[63:00.62]Don't get paid bits to chat with strangers.
[63:02.68]You want to chew the rag, go talk to... Everybody that streamed this game said... Everybody that's... I'm going to say this.
[63:08.59]If you've seen this playthrough like probably 10 times at this point, I do.
[63:13.87]You probably heard that joke like 10 times now.
[63:20.88]You had to have heard that already.
[63:22.03]This is just like a... I'm just going through like... That's just easy.
[63:52.63]No, I can't.
[63:53.61]I can't.
[63:56.09]I can't do it.
[63:57.93]Can't kill everybody.
[64:00.61]Or even scare everybody.
[64:04.81]This guy's not even scared.
[64:06.03]We're good.
[64:17.54]Alright, let's go!
[64:21.50]You killed everybody in Darkwood.
[64:23.66]I did not kill everyone in Darkwood.
[64:26.10]I killed, like, three NPCs.
[64:29.40]Two, maybe.
[64:30.38]One on accident.
[64:41.05]I like that.
[64:41.85]Okay, is there, like, a big revolver in this game?
[64:44.89]Tell me if there's, like, a big one-handed revolver.
[64:47.47]If there's not, I'm going to uninstall the game.
[64:52.44]Wait!
[64:52.66]I thought that just said, town leader.
[65:13.41]I can't, I, the game's not hard.
[65:14.63]I can't fuck around.
[65:22.10]But when I shot that guy in the head, I heard like... No!
[65:26.98]I thought it was a town leader.
[65:28.50]I don't know why.
[65:32.00]Red health bar means bad.
[65:39.09]Can I go this way?
[65:42.29]We have to take the unorthodox way every time.
[65:47.55]Ooh.
[65:48.91]That's pretty.
[66:01.53]This is really cool looking.
[66:07.68]Alright, so this is Edgewater.
[66:08.92]This is the town.
[66:09.50]What is this thing?
[66:13.80]Oh, NPCs.
[66:17.24]Coffin?
[66:22.11]That's kind of weird, what I'm doing.
[66:23.29]Alright, um... Whoa, hey.
[66:27.23]Where'd you come from?
[66:29.38]Corporate Trooper, Corporate Recruit, and then Silas.
[66:32.52]Hi, Silas.
[66:33.44]I'm just passing through.
[66:38.78]My pod crashed in the hills back there.
[66:40.82]How do you know I'm not a Marauder?
[66:42.47]Hmm.
[66:57.92]I never got your name.
[66:59.50]I'm Junko.
[67:01.12]Nice to meet you.
[67:01.62]I'm Alex Hawthorne, Captain of the Unreliable.
[67:04.96]What is taking on an identity?
[67:06.62]Identity theft.
[67:07.57]From day one.
[67:07.97]Okay.
[67:24.78]Who do I talk to about power regulator?
[67:27.36]I'm looking to make a little money.
[67:30.66]Junior in humor.
[67:32.22]Like a comedian?
[67:33.08]What's wrong with my character?
[67:46.90]My character just snaps into being an idiot sometimes.
[67:52.10]I'm lying to people and taking identities and introducing myself as other characters and being like really high IQ type shit.
[68:00.28]And then I'm just like, Junior, in comedy, I understand.
[68:07.08]The switch is just flipping every other conversation.
[68:12.83]I need a power regulator.
[68:13.69]You're pretending to be dumb.
[68:15.21]It's just you.
[68:16.27]No, it's... He's pretending to be dumb.
[68:17.61]Depends on the work.
[68:18.81]Will you offer me a job?
[68:35.99]You offer me a job?
[68:36.85]You're making people pay for their own graves.
[69:05.77]You want me to collect what's owed to you?
[69:08.97]You make people pay for their own graves.
[69:15.13]Well, that's fucked up.
[69:16.23]What a psycho.
[69:17.26]I'm the psycho?
[69:21.50]Quotas, mostly.
[69:22.84]Got a backlog of graves to fill.
[69:25.02]Bodies won't bury themselves, you know?
[69:29.80]I'll do it.
[69:30.92]Four workers still haven't paid up.
[69:32.90]Phyllis, Conrad, Ludwig, and Martin Abernathy.
[69:36.80]He's a special case.
[69:38.64]You may want to twist his arm a little.
[69:41.04]Okay.
[69:41.96]Why?
[69:42.90]He just is.
[69:44.12]Look, I don't want to get into it.
[69:46.26]Just make sure he pays up.
[69:48.62]Okay.
[69:52.95]I'll be back.
[69:55.90]Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click!
[69:57.48]Oh, we're at LML!
[69:59.78]Okay.
[70:01.31]The quest tracker displays objectives for the active quest.
[70:03.33]You can... Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[70:04.77]Alright, so we have some people.
[70:06.49]I think they're just in the town, right?
[70:14.67]Alright, town... Alright, town leader.
[70:17.59]That's where I got confused.
[70:19.93]This was hovering over the guy's head that I shot in the head.
[70:25.24]And I thought it was his name.
[70:27.22]That makes... Okay, now I get it.
[70:43.61]Hedgewater discovered.
[70:46.31]Alright, we're looking for... Some people in town.
[70:51.19]Keep your distance, friend.
[70:52.79]Sick house is no place for a traveler.
[70:54.11]Click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
[70:57.55]Who's in here?
[71:02.54]Who am I looking for?
[71:06.64]I appreciate the company and all, but you really ought to leave.
[71:10.20]You don't want to be seen around me.
[71:14.53]Why?
[71:14.75]I don't give a shit.
[71:32.29]What am I being watched?
[71:34.29]The walls talk is all.
[71:37.19]We all got sights on each other.
[71:39.82]Any of us breaks company protocol.
[71:42.34]Boss is going to hear about it from six different mouths.
[71:45.14]You think I care about the boss?
[71:45.92]Maybe you don't know this, but there's a real simple reason you don't talk to the plagued.
[71:51.64]You don't want what we've got.
[71:52.84]Wait, you guys plague.
[71:55.94]Medical and dumb.
[72:00.24]You should get really drunk.
[72:05.29]Alcohol kills germs.
[72:13.97]What a shitty diagnosis.
[72:20.22]Wait, I could be like a really stupid doctor?
[72:22.70]I like that.
[72:24.04]That's fun to me.
[72:24.92]I didn't know that that was possible.
[72:28.25]Uh, I'm not allowed to leave.
[72:30.23]What do you mean not allowed to leave?
[72:31.65]I don't want to spread what I've got.
[72:34.13]And I don't want to bring their spirits down.
[72:36.25]I'll bring it.
[72:36.97]Company always tells us weak spirits lead to weak bodies.
[72:42.41]If I didn't want to fall sick with plague, maybe I should have worked harder.
[72:46.19]Maybe I should have taken more pride in my work.
[72:52.64]That's ridiculous.
[72:53.24]You can't blame yourself because you got sick.
[72:54.54]What's that?
[72:54.78]And I'm holding the gun.
[72:55.26]I've got 38 points in handgun.
[72:56.02]Don't you know my points?
[72:56.71]Can you see my points?
[73:19.97]Sorry, I'm like a snake, guys.
[73:22.57]Don't do quick, fast movements in front of me.
[73:24.66]I will strike.
[73:25.44]Wait, is this stealing?
[73:36.02]Oh, yeah.
[73:36.62]No, I'm not gonna steal.
[73:38.55]These people are, like, sick.
[73:42.09]There's gonna be somebody in here that I need to collect from, right?
[73:44.33]That's sick.
[73:46.61]No, I'm not taking anything.
[73:52.87]What the hell is going on out here?
[73:59.97]Who's firing?
[74:02.76]What the fuck are you shooting at?
[74:09.04]Is it the rats coming out and this person's freaking out?
[74:15.50]Alright, so is there anybody else in here?
[74:17.81]What's this?
[74:19.19]Mechanical sentry?
[74:20.23]This is not stealing.
[74:23.09]How is this not stealing?
[74:32.73]This is not stealing?
[74:33.50]This is not stealing.
[74:35.64]How?
[74:42.82]Steal dehydrated water tablets.
[74:49.59]Alright, let's keep going.
[74:50.45]Who's in here?
[75:00.12]That's it?
[75:00.56]Nobody?
[75:00.86]Alright, I'm gonna just keep going.
[75:05.54]I would assume somebody was in here.
[75:07.32]I didn't need to talk to you.
[75:08.22]Alright, let's go.
[75:11.44]Is there... It's a map, right?
[75:14.67]So there is somebody in here.
[75:15.77]Well, that's the objective.
[75:16.75]No, no, no.
[75:17.05]There's nobody in here.
[75:21.29]Barbershop.
[75:36.32]Why are you coming after me?
[75:38.48]What did I do?
[75:39.18]Something's not right.
[75:39.90]Why do you have your gun up and just crawling at me?
[75:44.82]Okay.
[75:45.06]Now let's go.
[75:50.09]Uh, I... Resident.
[75:52.45]Resident.
[75:54.91]This indicator is kind of freaking me out.
[76:01.03]Where is this person supposed to be?
[76:02.75]There's four people.
[76:06.69]In here?
[76:08.71]Workbench discovered.
[76:09.67]Oh, he's terrible.
[76:13.53]When life gives you lemons, consider it a free trial from your friends at Spacer's Choice.
[76:18.85]Sure.
[76:19.89]Maintenance division.
[76:21.07]There are currently three open trouble tickets.
[76:23.53]Selected option.
[76:26.38]Trouble ticket?
[76:26.96]I can't do this stuff.
[76:28.94]Failure of main canary production line at heat processing.
[76:32.74]Open.
[76:33.54]Start production line.
[76:34.84]Smoke.
[76:35.14]Smell of burning saliva.
[76:36.76]Overheat.
[76:37.20]Klaxon.
[76:39.50]I'm not doing maintenance on your computer.
[76:45.98]But I am looking for people.
[76:55.21]You guys really, really don't like rats.
[76:59.49]Holy shit.
[77:02.91]This is super rat.
[77:06.71]They're shooting people.
[77:10.07]I'm reloading!
[77:19.31]Oh my god!
[77:25.54]The disease is from the rats?
[77:34.12]Alright.
[77:36.44]I still need to track down people that owe money.
[77:38.12]These people are distracting me.
[77:53.17]Is it this D?
[77:53.95]Wait, hold on.
[77:55.36]No.
[77:58.68]See that little indicator, the circle?
[78:00.64]What is that trying to show me?
[78:02.96]Is it this person right here?
[78:04.90]Is it this guard?
[78:10.06]Select the quest.
[78:10.98]I have to switch quests.
[78:15.26]Oh, how do I do that?
[78:18.95]Because I can't interact.
[78:20.79]J?
[78:20.87]Yeah, there we go.
[78:21.30]Okay.
[78:21.42]So I'm tracking it now.
[78:23.38]You can only track one quest at a time?
[78:29.78]Oh, well.
[78:30.46]So it's not this person.
[78:32.96]Alright.
[78:48.40]Oh wait, this is the one that he warned me about.
[78:50.07]The white dot is your crosshair.
[78:52.81]That's not...
[79:17.28]Take it easy.
[79:17.92]Mr. Thompson didn't send me.
[79:18.96]I heard you muttering to yourself.
[79:21.16]You want to tell me what's got you so nervous?
[79:24.02]You some sort of wandering alienist?
[79:26.62]Walking into a man's own domicile, pestering him about his mental state?
[79:33.98]So you're Martin Abernathy.
[79:35.86]I'm here to collect your gravesite fees.
[79:37.59]I'm positive you mentioned something about being plagued.
[79:41.88]Let's just... I'm just gonna cut the bullshit here.
[79:43.88]I'm here to collect your fee.
[79:45.22]Silas knows, doesn't he?
[79:46.88]That's why he sent you.
[79:48.24]That's why he wants me to pay up.
[79:50.20]He knows.
[79:53.72]Yeah, he told me everything.
[79:55.04]How long do you think you could keep it a secret?
[79:56.48]I mean, seriously.
[79:57.78]Sounds like he's already told you.
[80:00.08]You may as well hear it from me.
[80:02.32]I'm dying.
[80:03.52]I'm not long for this world.
[80:05.10]Test him.
[80:05.96]The day to my expiration is fast approaching.
[80:09.38]And soon I shall be ushered through the great cannery in the skies.
[80:14.60]It's plague.
[80:15.86]Has to be.
[80:17.16]Silas knows.
[80:18.40]He knows I got one foot in my grave and now he wants to charge me for the other one.
[80:27.67]I'm sorry to hear that.
[80:28.39]You're being paranoid.
[80:29.47]I'm sure it's all very tragic and heartbreaking.
[80:31.15]Pay me so I can get out of here.
[80:39.46]That's so rude.
[80:45.22]But would a dumb doctor Gunslinger that took one class of engineering before he dropped out of college say this?
[80:59.43]I don't think so.
[81:02.95]Sorry to hear that.
[81:07.17]Got it.
[81:07.63]Hmm.
[81:24.50]uh that depends on what you need a couple hours out of your day and some light second story work that's all there's a cache of anthracillin tucked away in the old community center powerful stuff stronger than what we got I'm a doctor I'm into this I need you to break in nab that medicine and bring it back to me but thievery
[81:48.72]is something that I am absolutely for in these games, yes.
[81:51.09]Mm-hmm.
[82:13.90]You're taking an awful risk trusting me, you know.
[82:16.65]I could just flip.
[82:17.59]If the marauders offered me triple what you're paying me.
[82:21.31]I'm just gonna, you know, I'm giving you up.
[82:22.61]Marauders don't make deals.
[82:40.53]Well, then that's on them.
[82:43.43]You don't want to make a deal with me?
[82:45.51]Fine.
[82:47.51]You know how that goes.
[82:50.09]Alright, we got another little quest here.
[82:51.51]Let's go over here.
[82:55.21]Barbershop.
[82:59.95]I see you're also a doctor.
[83:02.27]A medical profession.
[83:04.26]Please don't touch anything.
[83:06.43]Your hands are probably crawling with germs.
[83:09.41]Okay.
[83:09.99]Physical hygiene recapitulates moral hygiene.
[83:13.77]Cleanliness is next to lawfulness.
[83:21.01]I can show you my hands.
[83:22.43]Listening to you makes my head hurt.
[83:23.65]Intimidate.
[83:29.19]An intimidating, dumb...
[83:32.69]Doctor that is a pathological liar.
[83:36.29]I like this character.
[83:38.14]Uh, I can show you my hands.
[83:39.90]Look, here they are.
[83:40.52]We're both doctors, you understand.
[83:43.36]Hmm.
[84:06.05]uh payout ah gravesite fees silas and I had talked about this at length I thought I'd made it clear my pecuniary situation precludes the necessary restitutions uh I don't understand a word you said I mean that I can't possibly pay my gravesite fees
[84:27.10]I simply cannot afford it.
[84:29.30]I am a blemish on the prosperity of our fair settlement.
[84:32.74]When I expire, I expect Silas to toss my body into a ditch.
[84:39.01]I... just sneezed.
[84:43.45]I don't care, pay up.
[84:44.93]You have a very loose definition of the word prosperity.
[84:46.93]That's some quality drama, Conrad.
[84:49.15]You should audition.
[84:52.15]Don't be so hard on yourself.
[84:57.88]That's quality.
[84:58.50]Hmm.
[84:58.62]Hang on.
[84:58.94]Medical rights?
[84:59.56]Just give Silas an IOU.
[85:00.50]Forehead.
[85:21.04]Hang on, what medical rights you got?
[85:22.04]Some time ago, I fell ill with the plague.
[85:24.38]Does everybody have the plague?
[85:25.28]By the grace of the law, and through my own hard work, I'd proven worthy of treatment.
[85:30.75]Frankly, I don't imagine I'll earn that right a second time.
[85:34.43]The barber work hasn't been profitable, you see.
[85:37.07]I've had to keep this old place running with my own savings.
[85:40.55]Hmm.
[85:42.27]Let's give him an eye on you.
[85:43.21]Not a bad idea.
[85:45.53]But I'd need some kind of collateral.
[85:48.05]My pair of lucky clippers!
[85:51.86]Yes, it will.
[85:52.30]Where are they?
[85:52.89]Hmm.
[85:53.03]I'll let you know if I can think of anything.
[85:55.37]Hmm.
[85:55.53]Okay.
[85:56.03]Are those them?
[85:57.11]Well, I'll trade you.
[86:00.93]You just take this.
[86:18.37]Alright, let's go check on the other one.
[86:19.66]Uh, somebody's outside.
[86:21.94]Is it the guard?
[86:29.91]Shoot head rake his organs in.
[86:33.63]What?
[86:36.70]Wait.
[86:37.92]It is the guard.
[86:44.52]I have to collect from you?
[86:45.54]Wait, no, this is... This is the guy I have to come collect from you.
[86:57.07]Hey, you know that money that you were looking for?
[86:59.35]I need it from you.
[87:00.45]Give it to me.
[87:02.65]See you around.
[87:03.33]Wait.
[87:03.97]We're talking about Collateral.
[87:14.36]No.
[87:15.60]Fuck off.
[87:18.02]Dude, I should just click, click, click.
[87:19.92]You know what I mean?
[87:20.98]But I'm not gonna.
[87:25.89]Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot.
[87:35.37]Just kill them after you do their quest.
[87:36.73]No, I'm not just gonna ruin everything.
[87:43.00]Yeah, sure.
[87:43.87]Oh, just shoot the barber in the fucking head.
[87:46.31]That's going to ruin the rest of the whole game.
[87:56.54]There's the canary.
[87:57.22]I almost just accidentally fired the gun.
[88:01.34]What's in the canary?
[88:06.41]Let's take a look at the logs.
[88:09.20]The Edgewater-Saltuna canning facility strictly adheres to Spacer's Choice standards of health and safety.
[88:15.48]Schedule your sick leave with your Spacer's Choice foreman and or supervisor.
[88:19.17]Am I just using the computer?
[88:25.27]Whoops.
[88:27.11]Dehydrated water tablets?
[88:32.50]No, I'm no thievery.
[88:34.86]Not yet.
[88:43.38]Money.
[88:43.52]You the new worker?
[88:44.66]Whatever.
[88:45.34]Make it quick, tenderfoot.
[88:46.58]I'm busy.
[88:49.42]I'm guessing you're the foreman.
[88:50.97]Gravesite fees I'm here to collect.
[88:53.35]Shit.
[88:54.15]Sila's still on about that.
[88:56.17]Here, take the fees.
[88:57.75]I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell Reed I was late on my payment.
[89:00.45]I'm gonna tell him.
[89:02.57]These papers aren't signed in your name.
[89:05.38]Because they're not my fees and not my gravesite.
[89:08.28]Guy I worked with shot himself.
[89:09.84]I paid the bill.
[89:14.30]Yeah, that's kind of you, I guess.
[89:16.23]Hmm.
[89:32.26]You said they shot himself.
[89:33.18]Is this a murderer?
[89:33.80]Hmm.
[89:33.90]That must be tough.
[89:34.56]I thought...
[89:59.89]I thought you said that you were his closest living relative.
[90:01.75]Yeah, I was the closest living person relative to his body at time of death.
[90:06.01]I'm the one who found him, you see, so I pay the fines.
[90:09.96]Suicide's a crime.
[90:10.74]What?
[90:11.62]The legal term is irreparable damage to company property.
[90:14.92]What Eugene did to himself was vandalism.
[90:17.58]What?
[90:17.98]That's fucking ridiculous.
[90:22.80]What are they gonna do?
[90:23.90]Arrest his corpse?
[90:24.94]You can't be serious.
[90:27.77]You can't be serious.
[90:28.43]I'm plenty serious.
[90:29.55]In fact, I'm a little upset Eugene didn't think things through.
[90:33.43]In other words, Edgewater would have been penalized pretty hard.
[90:36.89]Whatever Eugene was worth as an asset, we would have had to pay out of pocket to Spacer's Choice.
[90:46.86]Would have?
[90:47.64]You didn't?
[90:48.12]He was a person, not an asset.
[90:49.92]Well, excuse you.
[90:51.44]I'll have you know Eugene was an asset to us all.
[90:53.95]May his atoms be commended to the law.
[90:56.78]All I know is Silas asked me for Eugene's gravesite fees, which means he was approved for burial, which means his papers went through, which means the town's in the clear.
[91:06.03]I'm just glad to put this whole ugly affair behind me.
[91:08.79]Eugene can rest his bones in peace and the rest of us can get on with our own lives.
[91:16.19]Eugene wasn't a guard, right?
[91:20.47]Because one of the guards brutally accidentally shot themselves earlier.
[91:36.38]Okay.
[91:36.90]I don't think so.
[91:38.78]Okay.
[91:40.62]I'll let you get back to work.
[91:43.68]Thanks for the money.
[91:49.69]Decipher the code.
[91:55.73]What is this computer?
[91:58.10]Personal files.
[91:59.64]Hack 5.
[92:00.50]I'm a hacker too?
[92:05.70]Password.
[92:06.38]Tenderfoot.
[92:07.02]Password accepted.
[92:07.81]Welcome.
[92:10.61]Personal files.
[92:11.19]I knew it.
[92:11.57]There's a fucking murder.
[92:12.44]This was a murder.
[92:41.43]Oh wait, the person's name is Eugene.
[92:50.61]Never mind, sorry.
[92:53.98]Sorry for the immediate accusation.
[93:03.88]The person's name.
[93:05.22]And I'm about to... You killed Theodore.
[93:08.00]You shot him with your own gun.
[93:09.87]And then you paid for it.
[93:11.81]You're talking... The person's name was Theodore.
[93:14.93]Not Eugene.
[93:16.59]Oh.
[93:17.35]Sorry.
[93:21.88]Let's get the other money.
[93:31.96]Do people get annoyed if you shoot a gun?
[93:36.79]If I just go like... I already know about you.
[93:44.70]What about collateral?
[93:45.58]Do you have to put it in the back room or something?
[93:49.26]What's this?
[93:51.54]Letter from Phyllis.
[93:52.55]Conrad, receptionist, shot himself.
[93:54.71]This is bad.
[93:55.53]Company's going to have to call it for what it is.
[93:57.51]Destruction of Spacer's Choice property.
[93:59.13]Eugene was an asset and somebody has to pay his body price.
[94:02.46]This is going to ruin us.
[94:03.96]So I was thinking that we pawn off his teeth.
[94:06.35]Eugene had a full set of gold teeth.
[94:08.99]Heirlooms passed down his family or something.
[94:11.51]You're processing his body, right?
[94:12.91]Just dig around and pry them out.
[94:14.57]We sell the teeth somewhere nice and quiet, use the bits to pay his body price, and nobody's the wiser.
[94:19.30]What do you think?
[94:20.54]Don't write back.
[94:21.12]In fact, don't talk to me at all.
[94:22.64]Just give me a special signal next time you see me.
[94:25.48]Waggle your eyebrows.
[94:29.06]Would you look at that?
[94:31.99]Conspiracy.
[94:33.45]Conspiracy to commit teeth fraud.
[94:37.31]Got ya.
[94:38.81]Uh, where's the body?
[94:42.17]Light?
[94:42.55]Ooh, wait a minute.
[94:43.15]What do you have?
[94:44.60]What's that?
[94:45.46]How much DPS do I have?
[94:46.36]Oh, it's the same gun.
[94:51.60]Hmm.
[94:59.41]Okay, so... Buried without the teeth?
[95:03.23]Oh, look at my eye on you.
[95:05.98]You're gonna owe a lot more than, like, 30 bucks.
[95:13.42]Oh, shit!
[95:14.20]I didn't mean to do that.
[95:16.00]Okay, so you can't... Don't aim guns at people's heads.
[95:18.04]Got it.
[95:22.02]So.
[95:25.67]A long tomorrow.
[95:27.57]Alright, a small grave matter.
[95:30.41]So where's Ludwig?
[95:34.68]He's stationed as a guard at the landing pad southeast of Edgewater.
[95:37.86]Okay.
[95:41.62]But I'm going to... Should I go to the graveyard?
[95:49.26]Talk to Conrad.
[95:50.20]Should I, though?
[95:50.92]I feel like I shouldn't.
[95:53.42]I feel like that's not going to work.
[95:54.48]What can I do for you?
[96:00.72]Oh, I'm not medical smart enough.
[96:02.88]I know about Eugene.
[96:03.68]Why not use his teeth as collateral for your gravesite fees?
[96:10.52]You know about Eugene?
[96:11.60]How?
[96:16.53]I don't know.
[96:17.33]Were you snooping around in my things or was it just dumb luck?
[96:22.05]Eugene's golden teeth were a family heirloom, representing three generations of poor dental hygiene.
[96:29.16]Bullshit.
[96:29.80]He took them to his grave.
[96:31.44]Bullshit.
[96:32.14]No, he didn't.
[96:35.10]I'm sure they were probably worth a few bits.
[96:37.24]More than a few.
[96:38.54]Those teeth were his personal savings.
[96:41.62]I can't ask Silas to dig up a man's body and pry a few teeth loose from his jaw just to pay my bills.
[96:49.28]Can I?
[96:54.09]I don't care.
[96:54.59]I'm just here to collect your dues.
[97:00.09]Yeah.
[97:01.05]Yes, I suppose I must.
[97:03.81]Here you are.
[97:04.91]Gravesite papers affixed with my signature and an IOU.
[97:12.62]I'm told he killed himself.
[97:13.80]What happened?
[97:14.50]Eugene was not a suicide.
[97:16.72]He put a bullet in his brain, yes, but that's largely a technicality.
[97:21.18]Hmm.
[97:43.74]Hmm.
[97:44.30]That's terrible.
[97:44.68]Hmm.
[97:44.76]I was responsible for this.
[98:11.86]I'm a pretty good liar.
[98:12.76]I could probably go lie to them and take care of everything.
[98:17.85]Thanks for the money.
[98:26.71]Alright.
[98:27.45]Let's go to Ludwig.
[98:36.50]Capitalism bad.
[98:41.16]Hungry roasted turkey dinner good.
[98:43.46]What?
[98:43.60]What are you saying?
[98:45.22]Alright.
[99:02.81]Ludwig.
[99:06.30]This is kind of fun, just kind of walking around and investigating and talking to people.
[99:10.96]It's really, it's doing it for my koala brain.
[99:21.55]Alright, you.
[99:22.21]I just shot all these people.
[99:26.81]Well.
[99:26.93]That's your playthrough.
[99:39.98]What do you want?
[99:40.36]Are you okay?
[99:40.74]You seem confused.
[99:43.22]Graveside fees.
[99:44.34]Cut to the chase.
[99:44.84]You seem confused.
[99:45.58]Well, fuck me.
[100:08.39]Oh, they mean to.
[100:10.13]Just you wait.
[100:12.29]Auto-mechanicals.
[100:15.37]Auto?
[100:16.05]Creatures forged in the fires of malevolence.
[100:19.56]I've seen them over by the old power plant, clattering about, firing at the birds, orchestrating their uprising.
[100:29.32]When the swarms of mechanicals come clanging on over that hill, where will you be?
[100:34.88]Cowering beneath your cot?
[100:37.53]or standing shoulder to shoulder with the resistance.
[100:45.95]What can I do to stop the coming apocalypse?
[100:48.93]You can gird yourself in the armor of righteousness, soldier.
[100:53.62]From this moment on, you are a proud member of the resistance.
[100:59.38]They have sent a scout prowling around the junkyard just behind our beloved town.
[101:05.44]This scout must not be permitted to return to its base of operations.
[101:09.74]Cross it off, then report back.
[101:16.92]Uh... Give me some pointers.
[101:17.61]Mechanicals got a weak spot in their midsections.
[101:20.07]I think the technical term is, um, the blue, glowy square thing.
[101:26.53]And I put my hand up and put it up my mouth and go...
[101:41.06]Alright, so now let's... I got a lot of random quests now.
[101:44.99]Alright, I have that.
[101:46.09]What about Stranger in a Strange Land?
[101:48.61]Collect money from few workers.
[101:51.63]You need to find a power regulator.
[101:53.77]Die robot.
[101:54.63]Ludwig Miller.
[101:59.97]Okay.
[102:01.11]Spotted a forward scout of the mechanical army north of the landing pad.
[102:05.27]Let's do it.
[102:09.13]Ludwig...
[102:11.94]Let's go do it.
[102:12.52]I'm ready.
[102:12.84]Is there a volcano in this game?
[102:18.77]Instant letter grade.
[102:22.07]Can I play with the lava?
[102:23.19]Like in those YouTube videos that you relax to?
[102:26.74]It looks like putty.
[102:27.56]Like hot, silly putty.
[102:41.45]cheese, hit cartridge, slaw, and what's this?
[102:49.66]Kane Van Acker, Spacer's Choice Ethologist.
[102:56.28]Assigned to Terra 2.
[102:57.80]This week I've decided to study terrore mating habits.
[103:04.59]Female terrores leave their nesting area in the morning and return in the afternoon with random objects, typically something shiny or bright.
[103:11.37]Then they build displays of these objects and perform what I can only describe as a dance.
[103:15.29]for an audience of males if a male likes what it sees the two go off and nest together in one of the nearby trees Gerald if you're reading this I'm done waiting for you collect my things and meet me at the next site and don't be late I expect punctuality from my assistants oh there's the assistant okay wait why am I why am I I'm under attack how am I am I under attack
[103:43.25]I'm not even under attack.
[103:44.33]What are these?
[103:44.83]Oh wait, this is... These are the birds!
[103:47.07]Can we just watch them?
[103:55.18]Uhh... I was under attack!
[104:15.25]I'm sorry, but I was actually under attack.
[104:27.25]Cool.
[104:27.65]Alright, let's go.
[104:29.43]So there's a scout over here.
[104:30.41]There's the scout.
[104:35.35]Should I sneak up on it?
[104:39.34]Damage.
[104:39.78]Oop.
[104:52.53]Hello?
[104:54.49]Searching for repair bay.
[104:57.88]Navigation systems failed.
[105:00.18]Unable to comply.
[105:01.62]Nothing a good smack won't fix.
[105:09.98]Navigation systems operational.
[105:12.92]Optimal path toward repair bay detected.
[105:16.10]Initiating self-diagnostics.
[105:20.56]Whoa, hey, don't you owe me something for the repairs.
[105:23.50]Spacer's Choice reminds all colonists that serving the Spacer's Choice family is the highest possible reward.
[105:32.39]I have been programmed to deliver this pre-approved message.
[105:38.73]Alright, bye.
[105:45.78]Well, that was easy.
[105:47.96]Transmute bit cartridge.
[105:54.76]kill it.
[105:55.98]No, why do I kill it?
[106:00.18]It gained its trust.
[106:02.00]The quest is to kill it.
[106:03.14]But why?
[106:03.68]But for what?
[106:04.52]I need to know why.
[106:05.26]I don't just kill people and things for no reason.
[106:14.79]Got a pretty good shot, though.
[106:20.48]It's for the robot takeover.
[106:22.81]I've joined the resistance.
[106:25.31]Well, I'm just gonna lie to him.
[106:28.31]Bring us honor, soldier.
[106:29.49]You won't have to worry about that scout anymore.
[106:34.54]You beat that scout to scrap with its own legs?
[106:37.66]Pulled its optic cables out its head case?
[106:40.70]Actually, don't tell me.
[106:42.12]Rather, use my imagination.
[106:44.54]You're a passing, fair soldier, I will confess.
[106:46.84]But you are one.
[106:49.94]the enemy is legion what you need is a new weapon equalizer a weapon to strike fear in their cold mechanical hearts cantina lavatory behind one of the toilets that's where I've kept it hidden all these years alright you hide your secret weapon in a bathroom sharp ain't it the lavatory is the very last place a mechanical has need to enter I mean it's
[107:21.26]It's an accurate statement.
[107:23.28]Alright.
[107:23.50]Level 3.
[107:23.92]Alright.
[107:24.94]More line.
[107:25.38]So at 40, scramble duration plus 7 seconds.
[107:48.19]Cowboy duration, terrify, area of effect, ranged.
[107:55.91]So what is it?
[107:56.35]Handguns at 40.
[107:58.25]Handgun critical damage.
[107:59.29]Oh, absolutely.
[108:02.84]Plus 50%.
[108:05.70]Long guns.
[108:06.94]Alright, I need to start doing some other shit here.
[108:10.48]Medical, right?
[108:15.85]28?
[108:15.99]Should I, yeah, medic a stupid doctor?
[108:22.32]Leadership, yeah, I want to be like a dumb engineer doctor scientist.
[108:26.52]Three medical, but what is the, in brackets, is that being affected by something else?
[108:37.06]Dumb detective doctor.
[108:41.18]It's the suit.
[108:44.82]Peter.
[108:45.12]Alright, I'm going to have 10 medical because I can use... Alright, then we're going to put the other... Maybe I'll just keep doing it.
[109:09.75]Do it again.
[109:11.90]Or just do this.
[109:15.51]And then a couple more.
[109:17.73]Alright.
[109:18.13]Good.
[109:18.97]Good.
[109:22.05]Let's do... Apply.
[109:31.79]Stupid engineer.
[109:33.03]Stupid doctor.
[109:33.95]Stupid scientist.
[109:40.48]That doesn't make any sense.
[109:46.24]Stupid fucking idiot, dumb fucking idiot, fucking doctor, dumb fucking scientist.
[109:51.56]Alright, we're gonna find the weapon.
[109:58.06]I hope it's a one-handed weapon.
[110:05.59]Is it one-handed?
[110:09.34]Is this the bathroom?
[110:10.26]Better use the bathroom.
[110:12.10]What the fuck?
[110:12.62]Find Ludwig's secret weapon.
[110:15.02]Oh, what is it?
[110:15.56]Return to Ludwig.
[110:16.08]I'll be back.
[110:50.13]Nice ammo?
[110:50.71]What do you mean?
[110:52.85]Do I have low ammo?
[110:56.46]Oh.
[111:06.77]Fucking idiot scientist can't even get over a railing.
[111:09.23]Give me a break.
[111:20.27]Nice frame rate, loser.
[111:21.61]I have a 1080.
[111:23.87]Yes, I have a 1 Omega Lull.
[111:28.86]8 Omega Lull, yes.
[111:30.24]I can't wait to see it.
[111:31.18]Please spam it.
[111:32.00]I'd love for you to do it.
[111:34.93]Bring us honor, soldier.
[111:38.26]There's the package.
[111:39.20]Mag 2 Zaf?
[112:04.73]Alright.
[112:06.19]So, what's next?
[112:07.21]Mm-hmm.
[112:30.21]I get it.
[112:30.53]You want me to go undercover as a mechanical and learn their ways.
[112:33.19]Logic module.
[112:34.47]Hmm.
[112:53.22]Hmm.
[112:53.32]Seems simple enough.
[112:54.67]Okay.
[113:16.81]You've gotten a weapon modification.
[113:18.11]Install mods at a workbench to upgrade your weapons.
[113:20.87]Changing damage type, adding a scope, improving rate of fire, and more.
[113:25.70]Cool.
[113:26.92]Alright, well, I'm gonna pee.
[113:28.62]So, I'll be right back in about two minutes.
[113:31.01]See you in a sec.
[115:42.34]Something interesting to note is my character is very stupid.
[115:48.26]Uh, so he's only done the first tutorial story mission.
[115:53.34]I've just been walking around looking at stuff and doing side quests for an hour.
[115:59.10]Just kind of realizing that now.
[116:00.48]Alright, uh...
[116:09.99]So, what objective are we on right now?
[116:13.21]Die robot.
[116:14.13]Speak with Reed.
[116:16.27]Ludwig wants you to head to the region's geothermal plant for an important mission, but to gain entry to the plant, you need to get the passcode from Reed Thompson, who runs the town of Edgewater.
[116:30.14]I also have to return to Silas.
[116:32.56]Let's do that first.
[116:44.78]I bet your piss is cold.
[116:49.07]I think that... doesn't that mean I'm dead?
[116:50.99]That means I'm not alive.
[116:57.11]That makes no sense.
[117:01.79]Cold pee.
[117:04.95]I mean, maybe if you like pissed into the air at like minus 40 degrees outside.
[117:10.66]Maybe.
[117:12.50]Grave digging's a fine profession.
[117:15.35]We need to talk about Eugene.
[117:17.11]You first.
[117:17.39]I know you buried him.
[117:18.05]Hmm.
[117:18.15]Open your mouth.
[117:18.75]Let me see your teeth.
[117:23.07]Hmm.
[117:44.63]He's got solid gold teeth.
[117:45.79]Could be worth something if you pulled him out.
[117:48.95]Yeah.
[117:50.05]Funny thing.
[117:50.91]Eugene's body ain't where it's supposed to be.
[117:52.83]That's hilarious.
[117:53.23]Real funny.
[117:53.45]The night we were supposed to commend his body to the Earth, I had his grave all dug up and ready, right?
[117:58.15]And so I thought, I'll just rest my eyes a bit.
[118:00.94]When I woke up, his body was gone.
[118:03.86]Spirited away.
[118:05.12]Vanished.
[118:06.56]The footprints nearby suggested that Eugene was stolen by marauders.
[118:11.84]Or he rose from the dead.
[118:16.01]Okay, I'll keep an eye out.
[118:17.73]Yeah, about those fees.
[118:20.43]I'm all done.
[118:23.76]Paperwork, fees, and signatures.
[118:26.06]Uh... I don't want to be a bother here, but I went... I went out of my way for this.
[118:40.87]And I'll buy you a drink sometime.
[118:46.01]I was hoping you'd give me something.
[118:48.63]I kind of want the helmet.
[118:52.43]What?
[118:54.08]You've lost Abernathy's Grave?
[118:55.92]Oh, okay.
[118:56.44]I was going to say, did I fuck something up?
[118:58.86]Something more tangible than that.
[119:00.60]Yeah, I want more than that.
[119:07.43]As I'm counting the money.
[119:09.09]Oh, Abernathy was trying to hide his illness.
[119:11.61]Am I a tattletale?
[119:12.47]Yeah.
[119:13.33]Abernathy was sick?
[119:14.69]With the plague?
[119:16.23]That's disgusting.
[119:17.81]I shook hands with the guy.
[119:23.18]He was convinced that you knew.
[119:25.16]What?
[119:25.88]No.
[119:26.68]If I knew he was sick, I would have had him reported.
[119:29.52]I needed his fees because of his name.
[119:31.98]A for Abernathy.
[119:33.87]He was at the top of my list, you see?
[119:38.10]I think I just sentenced that guy to death.
[119:46.59]Okay.
[119:48.17]I should go.
[119:50.25]Your reputation with the faction has changed.
[119:52.03]Enemies are hostile, but your reputation isn't kill on sight.
[119:56.18]Leaving for a few days will calm things down.
[119:58.04]Okay.
[120:00.12]Let's keep going.
[120:01.04]Now I'm going to do...
[120:06.60]Uh... Die robot.
[120:08.62]Is the cache of medicine completed?
[120:10.34]Okay, let's do this.
[120:11.72]Botched?
[120:12.36]You can botch missions?
[120:14.62]Alright, speak with Reed.
[120:16.25]Let's do that.
[120:20.13]Save game.
[120:25.21]Oh, I guess if you, like, shoot that guy in the head when you first talk to him, you're not gonna do his mission.
[120:43.66]Alright, up in the top.
[120:45.20]Edgewater!
[120:45.70]10,000 bits just came in.
[120:54.55]That was 10,000 from a turtle duck.
[120:56.29]That's a $100 bit drop.
[120:57.17]Thank you, turtle duck.
[121:10.41]That's massive bits.
[121:12.51]Let's see.
[121:13.09]What do you say here?
[121:15.13]Hey, Jeremy.
[121:15.41]I've been watching your streams and videos for many years.
[121:17.69]Your content is and has been helping me get through some real tough times of dealing with depression and anxiety.
[121:22.67]Even when everything seems like crap, your streams never fail to make me laugh.
[121:26.39]I'm finally on the path to getting better, so I just wanted to give something back.
[121:29.76]And thank you for bringing joy to all of us.
[121:32.50]That's really great.
[121:33.64]That's awesome to hear that you're starting to get better.
[121:36.66]That's the most important thing in this whole message here.
[121:41.81]That's great news.
[121:48.21]Thank you so much for the fucking hundred dollars.
[121:50.87]It's never necessary to do that.
[121:53.21]I appreciate it nonetheless.
[122:00.54]I wish you happy days and happy health.
[122:03.36]Go ahead.
[122:07.72]Thank you so much for your insanely huge amount of monetary contributions that you just dropped.
[122:16.49]But what about the nighttime?
[122:22.94]That too.
[122:23.38]Alright, where am I going?
[122:29.14]This music sounds like breaking bad.
[122:33.16]Yeah, it does.
[122:35.40]That's insanely accurate.
[122:37.44]How do I get up to the... I need to go up in like an elevator or something?
[122:45.74]Is there an elevator down here?
[122:53.44]Down a level?
[122:56.72]Jesse.
[122:59.50]No, this one right here.
[123:02.29]Look at the map.
[123:04.89]Look at the map, Jesse.
[123:11.79]Hey, Pokémon.
[123:15.08]Hi.
[123:15.32]Like a motocross suit.
[123:18.14]Look at those motocross gloves.
[123:41.13]Are you Reed?
[123:41.73]I was told I should talk to you.
[123:42.61]You must be the town boss.
[123:44.09]I'll wait until you finish, Scott.
[123:45.59]You were saying, Miss Holcomb?
[123:47.71]It's just what Bess needs is a proper refurbish.
[123:51.75]I can bandage her up and what all, but she's just old.
[123:56.52]Sorry.
[123:56.92]I'm sorry.
[123:57.74]I'll do better.
[124:00.20]And I do wish you'd stop referring to our cannery as Bess.
[124:04.36]Personification of company property is strictly contrary to the Spacer's Choice Code of Conduct.
[124:09.92]My apologies.
[124:10.98]I am not in the habit of allowing my guests to witness such a row.
[124:15.02]Now, what can I do for you?
[124:17.82]You're very clearly wearing an evil guy hat.
[124:23.13]I don't trust you because you're wearing this hat.
[124:27.01]It's that brimmed hat that has the rounded top.
[124:32.07]If this was a little higher and squared, you're a billionaire.
[124:35.60]You're like an eccentric billionaire.
[124:36.94]But no, you're a bad guy with this hat on.
[124:40.32]Uh, alright, I should- I- I- We can start with introductions.
[124:43.80]I'm- Didn't know.
[124:44.72]I'm not- That's wrong.
[124:45.80]Are you Reed?
[124:46.54]I'm Reed Tobson.
[124:47.80]Outpost administrator.
[124:49.36]I cannot help but notice you are not in uniform.
[124:52.03]Shut up.
[124:53.21]Idiot.
[124:57.21]Uh, uniform.
[124:57.77]What are you talking about?
[124:59.57]Shirt, pants, work boots.
[125:01.05]Company approved colors.
[125:02.15]I look down, I'm just naked.
[125:03.66]Honorable apparel of a local worker.
[125:05.36]Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Reed.
[125:07.38]I didn't realize-
[125:12.18]Let's skip to small talk.
[125:13.28]I've got a ship that needs a power regulator.
[125:14.90]I think you made the wrong idea.
[125:15.96]Wait, I need my... I need that, but I also need the... Only regulator we've got is hooked up to the town transformer.
[125:29.22]Mr. Tobson ain't liable to be keen on dismantling it.
[125:32.89]I beg your pardon.
[125:33.81]I am most emphatically not keen on any such thing.
[125:37.53]I can't let you have our power regulator.
[125:40.30]Hmm.
[125:52.50]Let's hear it.
[125:53.32]What?
[125:53.48]Wait, don't I need...
[126:16.04]I need to go here anyways.
[126:17.62]And you want all that power going to your canary.
[126:40.97]We could use the power.
[126:42.45]Cannery's been struggling.
[126:43.73]If we don't ramp up productivity, the company might cut us loose.
[126:48.31]Interesting.
[126:48.91]Saying the, um... He's saying it with an English accent.
[126:55.75]I guess you know the English, yeah?
[126:56.68]That makes sense.
[126:57.40]Okay, I suppose that's fair.
[127:01.96]I was not entirely sure how to tell you this.
[127:04.18]The botanical labs are not legally inhabited, but there are people who live there.
[127:10.20]Big subs.
[127:12.05]Big subs!
[127:13.05]Uh, ARO-san, thanks for the five community subs.
[127:15.01]Thank you.
[127:16.49]Congratulations to all the new subs.
[127:18.77]Thanks for the five.
[127:21.61]Uh, what a surprise.
[127:23.04]I never would have guessed.
[127:23.76]This fuck is a liar.
[127:43.56]If you want me to solve your deserter problems, I charge by the head.
[127:46.36]Good Lord, no.
[127:46.92]I don't want you killing anyone, least of all them.
[127:50.33]What?
[127:51.61]My hope is that by cutting off their power, you will convince those deserters to come back to town.
[127:57.43]Before you go to the plant, I want you to stop by the botanical lab.
[128:01.29]Oh, well, you didn't want me to... Speak to their leader, Adelaide.
[128:04.07]Tell her the power's about to go.
[128:06.45]And that it's time her band of deserters came back to town.
[128:09.21]What if they don't want to come back?
[128:12.33]How will I recognize Adelaide?
[128:14.59]Adelaide's older than the other deserters.
[128:16.37]She'll have floating text above her.
[128:17.77]She's dignified.
[128:18.85]Kindly.
[128:19.35]From what I understand, her camp looks to her for leadership.
[128:24.42]Okay.
[128:28.88]They must have left for a reason.
[128:30.10]Why'd they go?
[128:30.70]That reason was me.
[128:32.26]I asked too much and pushed too hard.
[128:34.91]But I am ready to make amends if they are willing to return to the fold.
[128:39.21]We belong to one community.
[128:41.12]The Spacer's Choice family.
[128:43.30]If we dissolve into factions, then we will all perish separately.
[128:47.80]Adelaide will understand that.
[128:53.58]I can't make any promises.
[128:54.72]Of course, I understand completely.
[128:56.54]Here, let me give you the passcode to the geothermal plant.
[128:59.64]A sign of good faith for so politely listening to me as I ramble on.
[129:03.32]We got die robot.
[129:04.42]Are you setting off for the Vale?
[129:06.95]Because I know my way around.
[129:08.77]I mean, in case you want a guide.
[129:11.81]I mean, if that's alright with you, Mr. Thompson.
[129:15.15]Sir.
[129:16.25]I hesitate to part ways with Miss Holcomb.
[129:18.89]but I cannot deny that she is talented and may prove useful to you.
[129:23.55]Okay.
[129:25.05]I can use the company.
[129:25.81]I don't need help.
[129:33.39]It's just a person that's just gonna walk around with me and shoot other enemies with me, so why not?
[129:39.51]Great.
[129:40.71]I got my wrenches and diagnosticators and hairpins and engine tape, so I'm all set.
[129:47.21]Well, I am glad to hear that.
[129:48.97]Best of luck to you.
[129:50.12]And thank you again for your help.
[129:51.66]It is a lot to ask of a stranger.
[129:53.38]She's just going to be walking around going like, Need ammo!
[129:56.38]Bang, bang, bang, bang.
[129:58.00]Watch it!
[129:58.94]Bang, bang, bang.
[130:00.62]She's going to take like nine bullets.
[130:04.26]That's all it's for.
[130:06.16]She'll draw like the attack of two or three enemies while I can shoot them.
[130:09.31]It's worth having.
[130:14.27]You've gained a companion.
[130:15.03]There are characters that join you in your adventures and help in a variety of ways.
[130:18.38]Combat support.
[130:19.88]Their skills enhance your skills.
[130:21.46]They increase your carrying capacity.
[130:22.96]You can unlock special companion combat abilities with the Inspiration skill.
[130:27.62]Right.
[130:28.16]Like I said.
[130:29.82]It's someone to walk around with you and just absorb enemy attacks.
[130:39.30]Wait, I'm trying to open his private door?
[130:42.38]Oops.
[130:42.62]I thought that was the way out.
[130:48.51]Alright, now let's go.
[130:49.95]I got it.
[130:51.93]Let's go get the logic module.
[130:53.87]Are you coming with me?
[130:57.05]What do you have for skills?
[130:57.83]How do I check?
[130:59.31]We better clear out of Mr. Thompson's office before we talk.
[131:05.71]I mean, you could have not said that right in front of him.
[131:08.41]Now he knows we're going to talk about him.
[131:17.93]Save the game and shoot.
[131:19.11]I'm not... Why would I do that?
[131:22.50]My character does not have any inspiration to do that.
[131:24.58]How are you really that paranoid?
[131:25.50]Well, I guess maybe this camera's... What?
[131:35.44]Can we chat?
[131:35.90]Oops!
[131:39.84]Companions for H- I thought you said no.
[131:41.76]Sorry.
[131:42.74]I... You just want to get out of here.
[131:45.71]And you likely don't want to tag along like me.
[131:48.63]It's just... Mr. Thompson has his own view on matters.
[131:52.47]On account of it's his job and what all, but... That's not the only side of the tale.
[132:01.41]That's just black masking tape over the top.
[132:05.24]There's no visual here.
[132:06.18]You can't see through these.
[132:07.88]This is a costume.
[132:10.54]Who's this a costume of?
[132:11.32]Alright.
[132:15.86]This is about the deserters.
[132:17.52]If I wanted to deal with nuance, I wouldn't be this heavily armed.
[132:21.32]Let's go.
[132:27.90]She's cosplaying as Parvati from Outer Worlds.
[132:35.17]If I want to deal with this, I want to just go do the quest.
[132:39.93]I don't really want to talk.
[132:41.86]You're a companion right now.
[132:43.86]There's probably going to be another companion in like an hour that I'm going to replace you with.
[132:47.68]So, I know you're going to tell me your entire story.
[132:50.24]I don't really want to hear it.
[132:52.92]I mean, no.
[132:56.48]Okay, what about the deserters?
[132:57.20]Okay.
[132:57.40]This town's got issues.
[132:58.06]I don't blame them.
[133:17.79]We're one big spacer's choice family, but every family's got the one the rest whisper about.
[133:24.08]Mr. Thompson's aiming to take away their power.
[133:27.50]They'll have no lights to see nor heat to cook.
[133:29.94]They'll be at the mercy of marauders or worse.
[133:33.66]I think you should talk to the town's vicar about it.
[133:36.16]Max, his name is.
[133:37.54]Okay.
[133:40.57]I'll think about it.
[133:44.47]What do we need to talk to the vicar about?
[133:46.91]Flipping a switch in your power mill.
[133:48.87]I'll think about it.
[134:26.35]Should I talk to this person?
[134:29.47]Comes now the power.
[134:33.17]Okay, Vardy wants to visit the town's vicar.
[134:36.00]She's a little uncertain about the task.
[134:39.44]Where are they?
[134:48.52]Where are they?
[134:49.56]Where's this person?
[134:55.52]Where are they?
[134:56.58]Tell me where they are.
[134:57.89]No, we're not going to talk later.
[134:58.99]I want to talk now.
[135:01.21]In the church?
[135:05.59]There's a church.
[135:14.26]Oh, now he wants to talk.
[135:21.14]Okay, point of... Ah, there we go.
[135:23.12]So, right there.
[135:29.79]Well, I'm just curious.
[135:39.38]I'm just curious.
[135:40.02]I just want to know what's going on.
[135:41.02]Alright, let's talk.
[135:43.82]Is it you?
[135:44.48]Yes, what is it?
[135:56.09]You're an outsider.
[135:57.93]Fantastic.
[135:59.45]Vicar Maximilian de Soto at your service.
[136:02.37]Or Vicar Max, if you're the sort who prefers brevity.
[136:05.75]And Miss Holcomb as well.
[136:07.75]How rare to see you out.
[136:09.75]And with a complete stranger.
[136:12.15]Curious.
[136:13.53]Just tagging along, Vicar de Soto.
[136:15.13]Don't mind me.
[136:17.43]I so rarely get new people to talk to.
[136:20.30]Name your poison.
[136:21.20]Anything at all.
[136:22.34]Spiritual counseling?
[136:23.84]This season's tossball predictions?
[136:26.28]the quickest way out of town.
[136:32.82]Parvati wanted to talk to you about what Reed asked us to do.
[136:37.61]How do you know I'm an outsider?
[136:38.57]What sort of spiritual advice do you offer here?
[136:42.19]They who are not satisfied with their work are satisfied with nothing.
[136:46.95]No.
[136:47.91]How about work fortifies the spirit.
[136:51.56]True exhaustion awaits idle hands.
[136:55.92]I was asking what your religion is.
[136:57.65]Hmm.
[137:15.58]much to put in a good word for me with the grand architect you know unofficial like that's not how it works the grand architect has no concern for us beyond setting the plan in motion I don't get it obviously look if we can figure out how to read the grand plan we can more perfectly align ourselves to it bringing everyone peace
[137:42.51]um okay well first there's the matter of these secret rights and animal sacrifices I'm kidding I'm kidding don't you know how stupid I am why would you say that to truly understand the metaphysics involved takes years of study and contemplation uh if I've already wanted okay I thought you would talk to him
[138:05.24]What?
[138:05.72]You wanted to speak to me, Ms.
[138:07.14]Holcomb?
[138:07.44]That's not what I... Every time I've tried to engage you in conversation... This is your doing.
[138:10.68]...you look at the floor, answer in single words, and slink away.
[138:15.00]I can't imagine what would be so grave as to drive her to my mission.
[138:19.65]What has Mr. Thompson asked you to do?
[138:21.45]Okay, why?
[138:28.75]Where's go get groceries?
[138:31.60]Number four.
[138:36.04]Cut power to the deserters.
[138:37.08]If you could answer quickly, we're in a hurry.
[138:41.02]I can see why that troubles you.
[138:42.34]Miss Holcomb has a soft heart.
[138:45.40]Always has, if you believe the talk.
[138:51.15]Can Pavardi get that treated by a Sawbones?
[138:56.49]I see today we'll be conversing without metaphors.
[139:00.11]I guess her condition is incurable.
[139:02.85]It's unlikely to be fatal, but she may feel more heartache than most.
[139:07.93]Could you maybe stop talking about me like I'm some kind of weird bug?
[139:11.82]Sorry.
[139:15.08]Oh, right.
[139:16.12]Can we wrap this up?
[139:18.48]There's two or three people speaking through me.
[139:23.13]Does she have sawbones?
[139:25.57]Hey, can we wrap this up?
[139:26.41]We're in a hurry.
[139:29.76]What do you advise?
[139:30.56]Assuming your goal is to save as many as possible, then you should bring everyone together.
[139:36.04]Send the power to Edgewater and convince the deserters to return to the fold.
[139:42.57]Okay.
[139:44.53]Bring everyone together.
[139:45.39]Send the power to Edgewater and convince the deserters to return.
[139:48.07]So you want me to do the thing that I was told to do?
[139:55.00]Isn't that what he wants me to do?
[139:56.06]So you want me to do that too.
[139:57.68]I'm not doing it now.
[139:58.94]I'm going to go against it.
[140:01.00]I'm my own president.
[140:05.45]We talked to the president.
[140:06.39]We talked to the religion president.
[140:07.91]I'm my own president.
[140:09.15]I'm doing my own thing.
[140:14.43]I'll keep that in mind.
[140:15.63]If it were as easy as a few soothing words in the right ears, I'm sure it would have been done already.
[140:20.97]Consider it a challenge.
[140:24.31]If you don't mind a bit of unsolicited advice, be cautious on your way to the geothermal plant.
[140:30.32]It is not as safe as you might assume.
[140:35.18]been outside I'm not impressed I can handle myself the marauders I met when I ventured outside the walls might agree with you would you like to come with me bastard snuck up on me while I was dutifully hunting for a banned book in a collector's library barely escaped with my life but you see one of the reasons I transferred here was to get my hands on that heretical text yeah it is town president religion president me president I'd pay quite a handsome sum for the book really
[141:08.74]I'll assume you'll want to burn it once you get your hands on it.
[141:15.16]Why would a vicar be after a banned heretical book?
[141:19.47]Spellcrafting lie.
[141:25.41]Hmm.
[141:29.51]Seems like the authorities would be interested to hear that you're after this contraband.
[141:34.92]Maybe I'll get you a book and sell it to somebody else.
[141:38.11]I can assure you, you won't find another willing to risk imprisonment to possess this book.
[141:43.52]Nor anyone willing to pay the price I can offer.
[141:46.98]Price?
[141:50.20]Hmm.
[141:51.26]Compelling argument.
[141:52.16]Glad we see eye to eye.
[141:54.54]It's a handwritten journal.
[141:56.26]A faded blue cover with the name M. Bakunu handwritten in the lower corner.
[142:01.20]I'll mark where I saw it on your map.
[142:03.42]Assuming you're serious?
[142:05.73]Depends how serious you are.
[142:10.65]What am I stuck on?
[142:25.12]The chair.
[142:25.60]Alright, let's go.
[142:26.10]Alright, now comes the power.
[142:33.60]Let's do it.
[142:35.56]Follow me.
[142:48.98]In all capitals.
[142:50.46]Kill a fucking NPC.
[142:52.44]Holy shit.
[142:59.42]Jesus.
[143:01.44]Why?
[143:07.56]Kill an NPC.
[143:09.04]I must be fed with bloodshed.
[143:21.82]Am I having fun?
[143:24.46]Yeah, it's... I'm having fun.
[143:26.60]It's interesting so far.
[143:27.52]I feel like I'm just getting started, so... I don't really have... You know, we're only like two hours into the game.
[143:35.57]That's pretty early.
[143:36.29]He doesn't want to kill people.
[143:49.49]I don't want to just take a dog shit on my playthrough.
[143:57.70]You guys want me to lob a grenade into that guy's office?
[144:00.34]It's like... Okay.
[144:05.52]Then I just diarrhea on my fucking playthrough.
[144:15.02]Alright, am I hurt?
[144:16.14]Oh my god.
[144:18.18]Hey, can you be like a mine detector?
[144:21.28]Can you detect mines for me?
[144:26.34]Wait, what does X do?
[144:34.70]Alright, should I go in here?
[144:36.12]Wait.
[144:38.78]Community center.
[144:40.40]No.
[144:42.62]Who's that?
[144:43.72]Marauder.
[144:50.32]Told you.
[144:51.92]Here we go.
[144:54.25]Watch it.
[145:04.15]Wait, attack.
[145:08.38]Good.
[145:09.22]Exactly what I thought was going to happen.
[145:27.24]Is she dead?
[145:27.74]Are we alright?
[145:34.29]Alright, where's the, uh... We need to loot the bodies.
[145:41.90]Do you want me to shush?
[145:51.62]Loot the bodies!
[145:59.85]assault rifle can I give her weapons does she even have a weapon something you need it's the thing alright let's go I have what I have six heels alright I'm gonna be more careful because this is on hard
[146:31.87]Bit cartridge.
[146:33.44]Light ammo and a trip blade?
[146:36.68]Ooh.
[146:48.47]Alright, don't just sprint everywhere.
[146:49.71]I have to walk.
[146:53.25]Evicted.
[146:56.35]Wait.
[146:57.45]There's a house over here.
[147:03.07]Only 39 bullets.
[147:04.67]Everyone's dead.
[147:07.17]Assault rifle.
[147:10.07]Makeshift low-pressure suit.
[147:12.33]What is that?
[147:14.61]Keeping your company gear in tip-top shape is expected in something you're carrying needs repair.
[147:19.94]You can repair weapons and armor out of workbench using weapon and armor parts.
[147:24.30]Give them a breaking down on wanted items.
[147:25.80]Players with engineering skill can repair their gear without the need of a workbench.
[147:30.45]Okay.
[147:31.51]What's wrong with me?
[147:33.31]This needs to be repaired.
[147:38.75]Okay, I have so many of these.
[147:41.79]Can I just... What is this, one-handed?
[147:52.98]This is two-handed.
[147:54.22]I mean, I could just use this, even though... I mean, that's so much more damage.
[148:02.84]Okay, inspect.
[148:05.16]Um... How do I repair this?
[148:12.04]Armor management.
[148:15.40]No, okay.
[148:16.98]Yeah, yeah, yeah, manage your own breakdown, inspect them.
[148:18.86]Alright, what's this?
[148:20.38]Three armor, four armor, nine armor!
[148:26.50]That's pretty good.
[148:28.22]Tech skills plus five.
[148:34.32]Compare it.
[148:34.80]Okay.
[148:40.80]Yeah, this is better.
[148:41.74]What does this thing do?
[148:42.48]Stealth skills.
[148:43.24]Okay.
[148:47.18]Consumables.
[148:48.06]Here you can use junk or drop your consumables.
[148:52.10]Your emergency medical inhaler is shown at the top of the screen.
[148:54.10]It uses Adreno as fuel.
[148:57.54]Sure.
[148:58.89]Increase your medical skills to unlock more drug mixing slots that can hold all types of consumables, not just Adreno.
[149:06.11]Each slot is mixed into every puff of the inhaler for a combined effect.
[149:14.54]Adreno.
[149:15.68]Wait, I can breathe in, like, bread?
[149:21.49]How do you inhale bread?
[149:28.43]Okay, well, that's... I only have one slot anyways.
[149:34.32]Modifications.
[149:36.36]Range weapon mod.
[149:37.26]Magazine changes the weapon's damage type to shock.
[149:43.39]Okay, how do I use this?
[149:48.11]General... Alright, how do I... How do I use this stuff?
[149:55.46]I have to use a workbench.
[149:56.40]Okay, right.
[149:57.88]Has to be on a workbench.
[149:58.96]Alright, that's good to know.
[150:00.10]Let me test out this weapon.
[150:01.44]She's not going to be able to cross that.
[150:13.66]I didn't even go in this building.
[150:18.51]There's not much ammo in it?
[150:19.53]No.
[150:20.53]Ooh.
[150:21.13]Can I open this?
[150:23.35]No, I'm not smart enough to open this.
[150:28.12]Evicted?
[150:28.60]Or can I go in?
[150:32.02]Shit.
[150:34.80]I can't open these.
[150:35.50]Oh, I gotta do this.
[150:43.45]Sleep?
[150:47.99]Dervish Mist?
[150:50.47]A clone or something?
[150:53.27]Money.
[150:59.00]Noodles.
[150:59.92]Breathe that stuff in.
[151:02.66]Bin.
[151:02.94]Okay.
[151:05.95]Alright, should we sleep?
[151:08.85]Sleep for... No, don't sleep.
[151:12.95]Resting in a bed is relaxing and moves time forward.
[151:15.00]In supernova difficulty, you can only rest in your bed on your ship.
[151:17.98]That's probably terrible.
[151:21.56]Sleep for a week.
[151:30.36]He's not killing everyone.
[151:31.30]Get mad.
[151:32.06]Yeah, get mad.
[151:37.30]I'm not killing everyone.
[151:39.48]Move along, stranger.
[151:41.28]We don't want any trouble.
[151:46.82]Well, you have a sniper rifle and we're standing right next to each other, so... I'm at the advantage.
[151:51.74]I don't know you.
[151:53.36]Whatever you're looking for, it ain't here.
[151:55.55]Move along.
[152:00.85]I'm looking for Adelaide.
[152:06.29]I need answers.
[152:10.95]I'm looking for the geothermal plant.
[152:13.55]Reed says something about former workers living out in the wilderness.
[152:17.29]No, don't bring up Reed.
[152:18.83]They probably hate Reed.
[152:21.42]Where's the plant?
[152:22.82]A geo-what?
[152:24.20]Look, plants ain't my purview.
[152:26.72]You're bitter off asking after Adelaide.
[152:28.76]Just dealing with an imbecile here.
[152:29.96]Dealing with idiots.
[152:30.45]You're going to start wandering around my camp.
[152:32.87]Know that I got my sights on you.
[152:35.17]I'm of an intelligence level higher than this?
[152:38.37]You don't know what a geothermal plant is?
[152:42.91]Wow.
[152:43.55]Unbelievable.
[152:49.67]Over in the hothouse.
[152:50.91]Tending crop.
[152:52.68]Do you?
[152:52.90]No.
[152:52.96]But I can pretend to.
[152:53.68]We've all got problems.
[152:54.68]The quick turn.
[152:55.26]I'll go look.
[153:24.57]I'll keep an eye out.
[153:25.65]It's not like Zoe to go wandering.
[153:27.95]Figured she might be out scavenging, but that ain't exactly her talent.
[153:32.63]Can't imagine where she's gone.
[153:34.17]The hill's a wide place.
[153:36.83]She could be anywhere.
[153:41.87]Wow.
[153:47.80]Holy shit, that's horrendous.
[153:51.40]Could do without the gallows humor.
[154:06.51]Alright, where is... This is a deserter.
[154:12.51]So do you.
[154:22.08]Oops!
[154:22.54]Oh, no, you... Oh, no, okay.
[154:29.14]And I want to sleep in your bed.
[154:52.78]No, I look I'm only a thief when I can't be seen doing it That stuff that that stuff's pretty good, alright Chicken It's gone
[155:19.02]Pet chicken.
[155:19.26]Can you pet chicken?
[155:19.66]No.
[155:20.38]What's that smell?
[155:43.35]That'd be the garden, dear.
[155:45.75]You're standing in a garden.
[155:48.99]Also fertilizer, so mind your boots.
[155:52.33]Excuse me, Miss McDevitt?
[155:54.49]Sorry, it's just... you got such pretty trees in here.
[155:59.31]Why, thank you.
[156:01.46]You're Robert's girl, aren't you?
[156:03.56]I remember when you were but a sprout.
[156:07.50]Thomas speaks of you often.
[156:10.29]I want attention talk to me you should try some of my tobacco it's my game I brew it in an old spit too but it's been cleaned uh looks like you made a home for yourself here a home for anyone who's ever turned their backs on edgewater a home for those of us with nowhere left to go and nothing to lose
[156:35.81]So like the spores of the puffball, cast on the wind and alighting on fresh soil, we put down new roots.
[156:48.20]That's too dumb.
[156:51.30]Even if you were dumb, you wouldn't say this.
[157:00.06]My goodness.
[157:01.79]Alright, you just charming.
[157:03.31]You have to do the tuber choice.
[157:07.95]I was sent to make peace with you.
[157:09.23]Wait.
[157:09.33]He's a lizard?
[157:09.65]I didn't know that.
[157:10.43]Oh.
[157:11.53]You're living off power that belongs to the town.
[157:13.73]Come back to the...
[157:29.80]Can I... Canary.
[157:31.86]That's about it.
[157:33.32]Reed asks you to consider coming back to town.
[157:34.90]He's willing to make amends.
[157:35.84]Something about coming back to town or losing power, I wasn't really listening.
[157:39.56]I can't say I blame you.
[157:41.38]Reed is positively soporific.
[157:44.74]Like everything else that comes out of Edgewater, that peace offering is canned.
[157:50.15]I and my own are living just fine out here by ourselves.
[157:57.07]This is serious.
[157:58.71]I'm about to cut off your power.
[158:03.27]This is serious.
[158:05.48]For money.
[158:07.78]For money.
[158:08.78]Money.
[158:11.60]Your camp has a power regulator.
[158:13.10]I needed to repair my ship.
[158:15.56]Seemed like the right thing to do.
[158:16.62]My reasons are my own.
[158:27.32]Just like my Twitter profile.
[158:30.56]It's in my bio.
[158:31.46]It's in my biography when you go to my Twitter.
[158:33.35]Hmm.
[158:59.12]Hmm.
[158:59.98]Arrow to you, maybe.
[159:01.01]I'm looking for a power regulator.
[159:02.65]Reed promised me yours.
[159:05.53]Canary's got a regulator.
[159:07.73]You want ship parts, you ought to rip them out of the canary's guts and leave us be.
[159:14.01]Hmm.
[159:15.89]Let's say I help you.
[159:17.71]What happens to Edgewater?
[159:19.36]Life in Edgewater grinds to a halt.
[159:21.64]The canary shuts down, workers desert in droves, and our own little camp grows and thrives.
[159:34.97]You all doing drugs here?
[159:38.93]Yeah, like, you doing drugs?
[159:40.61]Because... I trust you will listen to your conscience.
[159:57.81]Favardi, what should we do?
[159:59.01]Where are we headed?
[159:59.47]I don't know.
[160:00.59]You tell me.
[160:02.28]You mean about the mission being too clean?
[160:05.67]Might as well leave.
[160:06.15]Alright.
[160:09.53]That's what we got.
[160:11.77]A long gun is... What's a long gun?
[160:13.97]A sniper?
[160:19.26]What do I want here?
[160:19.94]60.
[160:19.96]Dialog.
[160:23.62]I want to be able to lie better.
[160:28.49]Is it assault rifles?
[160:35.00]At 20 medicine, I'll have the second drug mixing slot.
[160:47.59]Improve your weapons and armor in the workbench.
[160:50.19]Okay, I want that second slot.
[160:58.39]Yep, that looks good.
[161:03.46]A new perk.
[161:04.53]Hmm.
[161:05.57]I have one perk point.
[161:14.57]Vendor prices.
[161:15.39]I'm just gonna steal whatever I can't buy, so what's the point?
[161:21.07]You take better care of your weapons and armor than most people.
[161:23.32]That's probably good.
[161:24.88]Or a faster sprint.
[161:31.89]Damage when alone in a party, plus 25% damage when alone.
[161:36.93]Goodbye.
[161:39.96]Sprint is really good, though.
[161:42.98]Yeah.
[161:44.44]Yeah, faster sprint speed.
[161:46.44]It's true.
[161:51.36]Alright.
[161:56.97]Let's do... First, let's get this shit out of the way.
[162:06.35]I can either divert the power to Edgewater or I cannot divert the power to Edgewater.
[162:11.88]We have to make a decision.
[162:37.59]Look, if I'm going to give you power, then I may as well take all the money.
[162:48.96]Because, I mean, look, that's fair.
[162:52.78]I do the really dangerous mission and I sacrifice myself and make it so you get power diverted to you.
[162:58.78]But I take all the money in your houses.
[163:05.69]That's fair.
[163:10.54]Zoe's journal.
[163:12.31]Well, today's the day, Zoe.
[163:14.63]Today is the day you take your destiny into your own hands.
[163:17.53]I've been listening to grace talk about the Marauder threat.
[163:20.43]Bands of wild, free-spirited bandits living in camps out in the hills.
[163:24.54]Barrel fire has probably mounted the heads of their enemies on spikes as a warning to people like me.
[163:30.69]Three of any rules.
[163:31.67]I bet they could take the whole region.
[163:34.96]I've been talking away some of our food.
[163:38.08]I've come to some spare cans of tuna.
[163:40.42]I wish I'd last me a couple weeks.
[163:43.32]So you went there willingly.
[163:45.88]I got odds those marauders will let me throw in with them if I dangle a couple syringes of Adrena Thyme before their eyes.
[163:52.26]This is gonna be great.
[163:53.92]Bandit Queen Zoe's origin story has just begun.
[163:58.38]I'm gonna have a whole gang of marauders at my back.
[164:01.58]Uh, maybe I can even score some rizzos.
[164:05.16]Well, that's new info.
[164:08.52]What about this?
[164:12.23]Uh, no more edgewater for me.
[164:13.63]No more cannery.
[164:15.25]No more jumpsuits and gloves.
[164:17.11]Yes, ma'ams, and would you like another?
[164:20.01]I don't know why I'm writing this down for posterity's sake.
[164:24.22]fuck the canary I don't think I'll ever have to look back in this journal who cares I'm gonna go be a marauder and so I got sick everybody gets sick well okay I got sick and I grabbed a little too much adrenal time is that really a crime gotta treat myself when I'm sick don't I what if I happen to personal responsibility and surviving by one's own bootstraps oh but you misappropriate one box of adrenal time and you suddenly you're committing larceny

[165:34.43]It's out of here.
[165:36.25]Let's go do this first.
[165:37.01]Is there a way I can leave here quickly?
[165:49.18]Workbench, wait!
[165:57.05]No, that's just a regular bench.
[165:58.11]Where's workbench?
[165:59.61]There it is.
[165:59.89]Get out of my way.
[166:04.11]Alright.
[166:05.31]Let's do this one.
[166:10.17]Install modifications.
[166:15.66]This is a shock weapon.
[166:19.18]Modify light pistol with the mag 2 zap.
[166:21.22]Mods can't be recovered after installation.
[166:23.52]If you install this modification of this slot, the current one will be destroyed.
[166:27.08]No, wait.
[166:29.34]What's in it now?
[166:30.44]Magazine size plus 50%.
[166:31.50]It's going to make the DPM, the damage per minute, up.
[166:43.19]Yeah, let's do it.
[166:49.11]So wait, now I can do this.
[166:55.31]Wait, where'd it go?
[166:58.90]Is that it?
[166:59.92]No, modifications.
[167:00.98]Magazine zero.
[167:01.80]Oh, is it because it's damaged?
[167:13.28]Okay, how much does it take to repair?
[167:16.91]Repair is E. It takes... Oh, more damage.
[167:20.37]Oh, 8?
[167:21.13]Yo, I only have 21 weapon parts!
[167:29.98]Where's the other pistol, though?
[167:31.40]Am I out of my mind?
[167:32.68]Didn't I have two pistols to modify?
[167:46.69]This is the companion's weapons!
[167:49.87]How do I take these from you?
[167:51.17]Can I take these?

[168:47.79]Okay, here's the companion.
[168:48.81]I didn't know it was gonna be like on the menu.
[168:50.88]I thought it was gonna be like up here or like inventory.
[168:52.92]Like, oh, Pavarti's menu.
[168:56.18]Whatever, give me this.
[169:02.32]Okay, how do I take it off?
[169:06.79]Here, I'll take this instead.
[169:09.94]I have to replace it with something.
[169:10.98]Take the machine gun.
[169:11.70]Give me this back.
[169:13.18]Actually, give me this too.

[169:37.25]Just make you do more damage?
[169:38.55]Tinker.
[169:40.25]Yeah, let's do it.
[169:42.97]You want to tinker the light pistol?
[169:45.19]Yeah.
[169:49.05]Tinker it again.
[169:56.23]Tinker it again?
[169:57.25]Yeah.
[169:57.85]No.
[169:58.78]That's good.

[170:15.63]Nice.
[170:17.39]Now this thing does more damage and it's a shock weapon.
[170:23.93]Brevardi is your favorite companion.
[170:26.45]That's cool.

[171:27.57]What about my food?
[171:30.61]Oh, okay.
[171:31.37]Apples.
[171:46.76]You can level up the health regen.
[171:47.96]That's not a bad idea.
[171:50.04]Go fuck off.
[172:03.59]I knew you were gonna make it.
[172:05.21]Whoa!
[172:07.57]Attack!
[172:14.43]That thing is... There are five damage types.
[172:17.19]Physical, Plasma, Corrosion, Shock, and N-Ray.
[172:19.43]Some enemies are vulnerable, but yes, I know.
[172:21.31]Shock is better.
[172:22.21]This thing has a lot of health.
[172:36.45]How do I revive?
[172:37.51]Alright.
[172:43.39]Let's go.
[172:46.92]Ooh, helmet.
[172:48.46]Salt rifle.
[172:51.84]A small percentage of weapons and armor you find are considered pristine.
[172:54.98]They have more durability, and they're just really cool.
[172:58.41]Good to know.
[173:09.05]Drino.
[173:10.95]What do we got here?
[173:12.27]Hack.
[173:12.59]Ooh, can I hack it?
[173:15.95]I need four hacking devices.
[173:19.96]Oh well.
[173:21.88]That's a lot of stuff.
[173:23.18]Sawed-off shotgun?
[173:27.00]Ooh, a sight?
[173:29.92]Damn it, alright.
[173:33.17]Too dumb to hack.
[173:38.99]Let's sneak.
[173:42.81]Oh fuck, there's a lot of people.
[173:44.01]Alright, um, is there like a melee kill?
[173:47.44]Can I sneak up on these guys and, like, slit their mechanical throats?
[174:08.60]Good.
[174:09.92]Don't just go out there.
[174:10.80]Why are you just going out there?
[174:18.96]You just keep... You continue to die.
[174:20.90]I only have... How many bullets do I have?
[174:22.68]Not very many.
[174:29.22]Ooh, flywheel?
[174:36.08]Bits.
[174:38.54]Doctor.
[174:38.94]Another light pistol.
[174:40.56]This is 100 DPS.
[174:52.36]Alright, well here we go.
[174:53.04]This is it.
[175:06.32]The light pistol sucks, Boomer.
[175:13.98]Well, who cares?
[175:15.00]Alright, vending machine.
[175:24.05]A hack skill of 20 or higher allows you to sell items to the vending machine.
[175:26.95]Cool.
[175:29.39]You can have high rep to sell restricted items.
[175:31.19]Alright, so what do we got?
[175:34.82]Tarmac and cheese.
[175:37.32]I need bullets.
[175:38.34]Light ammo.
[175:41.12]Yeah, let's get some light ammo.
[175:45.24]Uh... Buy the maximum.
[175:46.34]50 out of 50.
[175:46.84]What is this?
[175:57.46]Uh, how many of these should I get?
[176:00.90]Five?
[176:01.20]Okay.
[176:04.07]Sell.
[176:10.33]Only 9.4 dollars?
[176:17.12]Well, I can sell this.
[176:17.98]Because I don't need it.
[176:25.62]Can I not sell?
[176:26.34]Oh, is this restricted or something?
[176:31.62]Where's the sell?
[176:34.35]Sell all.
[176:35.95]Don't want to click that.
[176:41.55]Buy and sell items with bits, the official currency.
[176:44.41]You have not unlocked the ability to sell to vending machines.
[176:47.80]I thought I was only a certain level or something.
[176:51.48]Oh, fuck it, whatever.
[176:56.47]What?
[177:00.41]Dammit.
[177:24.03]Alright, we're almost... Why did it slow him over that?
[177:32.14]Can't do it yet.
[177:33.90]Use terminal.
[177:34.44]Unlock the door!
[177:37.22]Warning, this facility is in a state of lockdown.
[177:39.12]Authorization passcode required.
[177:41.42]Enter passcode.

[177:46.85]Personal files.
[177:48.45]Personal log.
[177:52.58]Oh, that hoehead.
[177:53.82]Found him fiddling around with one of the mechanicals, so I had to write him up for tampering with company property just in case I'm reading this a couple days from now and feeling bad for what I've done.
[178:02.14]Let me just remind myself that I've warned him before.
[178:07.33]Okay.
[178:10.64]Personal logs.
[178:12.80]Doesn't sit right with me.
[178:13.54]The company's never been wrong before.
[178:15.01]The company's been replacing our guards with auto mechanicals.
[178:18.67]At this rate, I'm going to end up chief of security with no staff.
[178:22.17]Okay.
[178:25.31]Worse has happened.
[178:25.89]Mechanical's gone crazy.
[178:26.99]Locked myself down here.
[178:27.93]Just trying to gather my courage.
[178:29.07]Going to make a mad dash for the control room.
[178:30.87]Might be able to shut things down.
[178:34.92]Reading security chief s Tanaka.
[178:37.70]This is an automated message initiated by spacers choice worker safety contingency protocols.
[178:43.12]Security lockdown has been initiated.
[178:44.46]This is not a test your behavior during this lockdown will be reviewed during your quarterly audit.
[178:50.50]Anxiety is a common side effect of life threatening situations.
[178:56.64]Fight back against anxiety with an ice-cold bottle of Zero-G Brew.
[179:01.59]Zero-G Brew and ale?
[179:02.73]That's good for what ails you.
[179:04.79]I can add.
[179:05.43]Alright.
[179:08.67]Door's open.
[179:11.54]There's already people coming here.
[179:17.74]Under attack.
[179:19.24]Let's... Where are they?
[179:21.64]Okay.
[179:35.88]Where is it?
[179:36.36]Where is it?
[179:36.78]Where is it?
[179:40.00]Where is it?
[179:40.30]I think it's flying.
[179:50.45]Just take everything.
[179:51.13]I can sort it out later.
[179:52.09]Necklace.
[179:52.63]Can I sell that?
[180:01.58]Speed Grip?
[180:07.32]Well, I can't sell it to a vending machine, but can I sell it to a person?
[180:09.98]A townsperson?
[180:12.52]Do I have to hack a person's brain to sell them a weapon?
[180:19.41]Okay, let's go.
[180:20.21]Alright, you go in.
[180:30.52]Z. Hold Z is... What does that do?
[180:46.28]X Z Enemy kill
[181:10.87]How much stuff can I even carry?
[181:18.71]I hear a noise.
[181:19.35]I hear an organic sounding noise.
[181:21.61]Not a mechanical sounding noise.
[181:27.43]Use?
[181:30.34]What the hell did that do?
[181:31.82]Did I- Did I just divert power?
[181:32.94]What did I just do?
[181:33.38]Did I divert power to the- What did I just press?
[181:39.78]I hope I didn't just, like, do anything.
[181:48.58]Prepared automatic.
[181:52.78]Self-diagnostics complete.
[181:55.36]Navigation systems operational.
[181:58.50]Combat systems operational.
[182:00.71]It's not the best choice.
[182:02.65]It's the spacer's choice.
[182:06.53]Okay, why are you not attacking me?
[182:08.72]Hostile actions towards Spacer's Choice mechanics are contrary to logical directive.
[182:16.42]All hostile auto-mechanicals must be defective in compliance with Spacer's Choice policy.
[182:25.65]All defective auto-mechanicals must be permanently dismantled.
[182:31.31]Please allow me to assist.
[182:38.23]Alright.
[182:42.93]Yeah.
[182:43.97]Confirmation granted.
[182:44.77]I like the sound of that.
[182:47.60]Go for it.
[182:48.50]Go take out all those mechanicals that are bad.
[182:57.22]Repair log.
[182:59.80]I'd like to formally express my gratefulness to be part of the Spacer's Choice family.
[183:03.78]Corporate just sent a team of technicians to conduct a complete re-fit of all of our mechanicals.
[183:10.24]Lore.
[183:12.64]I did routine maintenance.
[183:14.71]Found some strange modifications to their logic modules.
[183:17.17]Somebody fucked with them and made them aggressive.
[183:21.60]Filed the report, but my supervisor told me not to worry about it.
[183:23.72]Said the company knew what it was doing.
[183:25.95]What did we forget about?
[183:26.77]Any alleged modifications?
[183:29.19]I wrote this down so somebody would see it.
[183:31.87]Mm-hmm.
[183:32.23]Got my hands on a logic module.
[183:33.97]Time to do a little bit of experimentation.
[183:39.38]Did you know?
[183:43.28]Borrowed a copy of The Young Spacer's Guide to Mechanical Engineering.
[183:47.14]I think it's Volume 3.
[183:49.04]I need something to read down in the pit.
[183:53.09]Pit.
[183:53.39]Okay.
[184:03.22]Logic module.
[184:05.90]Guy's down in the pit.
[184:12.33]Hop in pit.
[184:14.29]He's in the pit.
[184:17.85]Where is he?
[184:25.02]Is that thing gonna go kill him?
[184:26.46]Alright, where are you?
[184:36.31]He's just down here?
[184:37.43]Thanks for the input.
[185:09.16]Gotta get it right in the belly button.
[185:17.12]Get it!
[185:18.92]Where are you going?
[185:21.63]Why'd you run by?
[185:27.37]Engineering 15, shut off the steam valve.
[185:31.98]Good.
[185:35.63]Scientist.
[185:38.01]Ooh, is it workbench?
[185:41.76]Yeah, I know about mods.
[185:45.28]Weapons and armor can be modified.
[185:47.32]Mods can't be removed once they're used, so put them on your favorite gear.
[185:50.84]Right.
[185:53.52]Alright, so... This is the zapper.
[185:57.39]173 damage.
[185:59.17]What can I do with this?
[186:07.37]No mods.
[186:11.99]Oh, I can... Oh, it's a scope.
[186:13.25]Should I put a scope on a shotgun?
[186:15.53]Would that be stupid?
[186:21.95]Okay, this is... Gyrosite spread is reduced.
[186:25.34]I mean, yeah, this thing's pretty good.
[186:30.00]I'm probably gonna use it.
[186:33.55]Whatever.
[186:33.95]This is better scope.
[186:34.75]This is better saturation.
[186:38.01]I'm just pretending I know what I'm talking about.
[186:45.75]Alright, so let me equip that instead.
[186:47.01]Doesn't need to be repaired.
[186:50.81]This is what I'm currently wearing.
[186:54.49]Alright, can I do something with this?
[186:58.99]No.
[187:02.25]Alright, this needs to be on here.
[187:06.67]No, no, no, wrong.
[187:07.24]Was it the one that I just modified?
[187:08.70]This one.
[187:12.92]I guess I can just put it on.
[187:15.30]Let's try it.
[187:18.35]Cool, I'll try it.
[187:19.55]Alright, we're looking for that, there was a guy that was screaming.
[187:32.88]Uh, alright.
[187:34.86]Where's the screaming person?
[187:37.24]That's not even remotely as good as the thing I was using.
[187:53.15]Oh, shit!
[187:53.89]Where are they?
[187:55.23]Where is it?
[187:56.97]Drone.
[187:58.27]Goddammit.
[188:01.81]Ugh.
[188:03.76]Alright, let me eat some food.
[188:13.03]Oh, fuck!
[188:25.76]That was actually pretty scary.
[188:26.96]Okay.
[188:36.38]Alright.
[188:36.84]Anything up here?
[188:37.48]Just ammo.
[188:47.30]Save it.
[188:49.37]This is too scary.
[188:50.19]Turn it off.
[188:58.01]Alright.
[189:02.33]This is where...
[189:05.39]A lot of shit on the ground.
[189:11.89]Alright.
[189:19.79]Don't... Alright, so that guy... Where was that guy?
[189:22.48]There was a guy, like, screaming.
[189:26.40]Is he up there?
[189:28.36]Security Chief's... Wait, why is my... Security Chief's corpse...
[189:37.56]Wait.
[189:38.54]I don't think I want to use this on a locker.
[189:44.06]No.
[189:49.22]Mr. Ouch.
[189:56.59]Alright.
[189:56.99]Hold on a second.
[190:00.71]Why do I have two different markers?
[190:02.23]There's that one and then there's this one.
[190:05.35]Why are there two markers?
[190:11.36]One of them's for... What the fuck?
[190:20.02]Move mouse over the markers to see where they are.
[190:22.53]Well, what they are.
[190:23.25]I mean, I'm on the wrong floor.
[190:36.74]How do I move the map up?
[190:45.13]Objective, objective.
[190:50.37]Is this for the same objective, though?
[190:51.79]Oh, did I get baited?
[190:55.13]Oh, oh well.
[190:55.81]Alright, well I'm just going to go back up here.
[190:59.94]Aim at the markers in the world.
[191:01.82]Yeah, security chief's corpse and logic module.
[191:04.68]Right, because the guy that's screaming.
[191:06.32]Alright, let's get the module.
[191:07.18]What's behind this, though?
[191:13.88]How the fuck do I get in there?
[191:26.97]Should I not be shooting you?
[191:28.17]Wait.
[191:29.09]Was this the thing I activated?
[191:31.49]The corpse has the key.
[191:38.56]I guess.
[191:41.38]I could pick the lock, though.
[191:47.87]Alright, uh, security officer's corpse.
[191:50.21]I need to get up here and down this way.
[191:51.69]So what's the correct way to go this way?
[191:53.19]I have to go up the stairs around somehow over here and then up, I guess?
[191:56.63]I don't know.
[191:57.41]I turned on the fucking ooze elevator.
[192:01.17]So I guess I'm gonna go... Is there a way to go up?
[192:07.54]This is going down.
[192:08.54]Oops.
[192:10.00]God fucking damn it, man.
[192:16.19]This is the thing that I repaired.
[192:20.31]It's killing this guy.
[192:21.67]It's killing him.
[192:24.17]Just kill it.
[192:31.20]No, load save.
[192:32.14]Load save.
[192:32.88]Load save.
[192:33.26]Where is it?
[192:37.54]Which one is it?
[192:38.06]Quick save.
[192:38.54]Quick save.
[192:39.00]Auto save.
[192:39.50]This one at 319.
[192:39.99]Right here.
[192:50.75]Alright, come with me.
[192:51.45]So I have to go all the way- I have to go down and then up.
[192:58.43]Where did he- where did he just put me?
[192:59.71]I have to go back to that pit.
[193:02.99]Alright, I have to go down.
[193:06.65]So wait, hold on.
[193:13.27]You're right here.
[193:15.53]Give me the key card, thank you.
[193:17.45]And give me your machine gun, fine.
[193:22.07]I was hidden behind a fucking block.
[193:24.21]Alright, now let's go over here.
[193:25.35]This is barred.
[193:29.33]I can't open?
[193:29.91]What?
[193:41.96]Module, let's go.
[193:46.14]Tactical shotgun.
[193:47.72]Alright, pretty cool.
[193:54.37]Okay.
[193:56.63]Now I gotta die robot and head back to the landing pad and deliver the logic module to Ludwig.
[194:03.27]Got it.
[194:04.71]I got a shotgun too.
[194:08.12]Now it's either divert power or divert power.
[194:14.38]I mean, now which one of these am I gonna do?
[194:21.47]How far away is this one?
[194:23.67]It's far.
[194:25.64]Alright, let's get out of here.
[194:28.42]Who do I want to save?
[194:29.34]What city do I care about?
[194:30.67]This is a very good question.
[194:47.55]Pull?
[194:47.97]No, I'll make a decision.
[194:52.65]I mean, why am I leaving?
[194:57.55]What about the guy at the bottom of the pit?
[195:02.20]I guess there was the guy there.
[195:06.52]Eh, maybe I'll go look for that guy.
[195:15.17]Save him?
[195:17.55]Alright, so I gotta go to the pit.
[195:22.63]He's down here.
[195:23.23]You hear him screaming.
[195:26.12]What was the way to go?
[195:29.52]Should I just go down?
[195:34.23]What are these things even for?
[195:38.65]This is probably some other quest or something.
[195:42.09]That I didn't get before coming in here, I'm assuming.
[195:44.33]I don't know.
[195:48.58]Alright, so where's that pit?
[195:54.02]Where's the pit?
[195:54.60]Right in the middle?
[196:01.53]Back around this way and down the hall?
[196:02.85]Uh... Where's this pit?
[196:15.36]That's the pit, I'm assuming.
[196:17.56]Should I just go this way?
[196:18.78]And down?
[196:23.72]Yeah.
[196:30.04]Go away, Phantom!
[196:31.62]I have to find a way down to you.
[196:35.56]I'm coming.
[196:36.14]I'm coming down.
[196:50.88]I'll be there in a minute.
[197:03.19]For a second I thought this was the guy from the beginning of the game.
[197:06.29]Phantoms where?
[197:07.11]Higgins, this Phantom's got a name.
[197:32.24]Alright, slow down.
[197:32.74]What's going on?
[197:33.10]How long you been down here?
[197:33.96]Okay.
[198:01.66]Oh, Higgins has been many things over the years.
[198:03.95]Sprat Wrangler, Saltuna Critic, Aetherwave personality, Chairman of the Board, Galactic Defender, Sisty Pig Tycoon.
[198:12.99]I've come a long way for someone who started off as a simple engineer right here in this plant.
[198:19.72]Oh, you... We have that in common.
[198:22.20]You and I are both engineers.
[198:24.10]I specialized in auto-mechanicals, drones, sentries.
[198:27.44]That's a good talking point.
[198:28.58]Prepared them, maintained, upgraded.
[198:31.02]Did it all from my old workroom just over in the next section.
[198:33.46]Okay.
[198:38.97]Right, was that before or after you became a sisty pig tycoon?
[198:48.37]How do you stop?
[198:55.08]I'm not afraid of any mechanicals.
[199:01.78]I can't even spell mechanicals.
[199:03.70]Or you can help me and I won't feed you to the sprats.
[199:06.14]Your call.
[199:07.33]Why 46?
[199:10.45]Spacer's Choice sent me here to rescue you.
[199:12.59]You can trust me.
[199:18.67]Dumb and persuade, I think is the way.
[199:20.95]You know, you remind me of myself back when I was an intergalactic adventurer.
[199:25.37]I discovered a flaw.
[199:26.71]Their hostility levels were hardwired to maximum.
[199:29.47]There's no changing that, but you could rewrite their targeting protocol so they attack each other instead.
[199:35.70]No wonder they're so angry.
[199:36.72]Somebody messed around with their logic modules.
[199:39.78]So I'm not stupid.
[199:40.87]That wasn't dumb, that was just engineering.
[199:42.67]Divert power.
[199:43.13]Oh, shit.
[200:03.36]Uh, okay.
[200:04.30]Actually, hang on.
[200:05.56]Time to divert power.
[200:06.04]Uh, just go fuck yourself.
[200:07.38]I don't care anymore.
[200:08.08]Alright, uh, let's take your impact hammer, because it's mine now, and your lubricant's mine.
[200:14.96]Okay.
[200:38.63]Do I want to save the botanical garden place, or do I want to save the high taxes workers are made out of gold bars?
[200:51.98]I don't know.
[200:53.76]I'm not sure what I want to do.
[201:02.89]How high up do I need to go?
[201:12.86]Reprogram the bot so they don't attack you.
[201:14.50]Didn't I already do that?
[201:17.51]Oh, I did it to one of them.
[201:30.26]Um...
[201:33.69]Wait, what is it?
[201:35.57]Long tomorrow?
[201:36.71]No.
[201:39.53]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[201:42.94]No.
[201:47.72]Am I going the right way here?
[201:48.68]Do I have to, like, wrap back around?
[201:51.75]Where's that power room?
[202:04.34]Where is it?
[202:05.58]Another one.
[202:13.34]Save the capitalists.
[202:19.78]I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[202:21.80]I have no idea what I'm gonna do.
[202:25.17]Here we go.
[202:25.43]Should I just flip a coin?
[202:27.85]Should I let fate decide?
[202:28.89]Maybe I should let fate decide.
[202:37.81]Redirect power.
[202:41.81]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[202:43.03]Did I just do it?
[202:44.04]I didn't get a choice.
[202:47.18]Safety failures detected.
[202:48.04]High likelihood of moderate or severe structural damage.
[202:51.85]Redirecting power is an irreversible procedure.
[202:54.31]Power redirection functions failed.
[202:55.67]Manual override required.
[202:56.61]Please activate all three electrical track switches.
[203:03.59]What?
[203:09.01]Oh, it's those things.
[203:09.95]Those things I have to activate.
[203:11.67]Oh, God.
[203:13.13]The goo tanks.
[203:15.71]Yep.
[203:17.25]Of course you're going to put me on a mission where I have to go activate the goo tanks.
[203:19.83]I should have just done them.
[203:26.64]Where is this one?
[203:27.36]Over here?
[203:32.79]Got it.
[203:35.55]Okay.
[203:36.55]Flip a coin.
[203:38.67]Go to random.org and just type in 2 and then press enter 50 times and then whatever it is.
[203:54.55]Whoa.
[203:54.75]She's like, wait, don't do this.
[203:56.16]I'm not going to talk to you.
[203:58.56]I know exactly what I'm doing.
[203:59.72]Well, what's your opinion?
[204:00.34]Well.
[204:00.54]Didn't she want me to do...
[204:17.47]We've been losing workers year after year, and corporate hardly ever sends replacements.
[204:22.20]There's barely enough saltuna to fill our bellies anymore.
[204:25.42]But the town's got some good people in it.
[204:27.96]Decent, hardworking folk just living their lives the only way they know how.
[204:33.55]They don't deserve to be punished.
[204:35.45]Well, this isn't like Fallout 3.
[204:38.15]I'm not nuking a city.
[204:41.23]I'm just turning their power off.
[204:47.17]I'm just turning off the power.
[204:50.57]Temporarily.
[204:51.43]And then we'll figure it out.
[204:52.97]Okay.
[204:55.87]Reed tells me Edgewater is going to die without workers in power.
[204:58.79]The Deserters are a community.
[204:59.95]I can't just destroy what they built.
[205:02.53]I think I'm ready to make my decision.
[205:03.71]Sorry, I didn't mean to babble on like that.
[205:05.53]I just... I felt like I had to say something.
[205:09.39]It's way here.
[205:11.45]Don't worry about it.
[205:12.03]I was barely listening to you.
[205:13.25]Oh, well.
[205:15.14]Okay, then.
[205:16.14]I made that really clear that I was very heavily listening.
[205:22.91]I'm a dick.
[205:23.75]Alright, here we go.
[205:25.81]Redirect power.
[205:29.51]Safety failure today.
[205:30.29]Are you sure you want to continue?
[205:37.81]Redirecting power is an irreversible procedure.
[205:40.43]Redirect power to edgewater.
[205:41.67]Redirect power to botanical laboratory.
[205:59.04]Alright, let me flip a coin.
[206:00.02]Alright, I've got my Nivea lip balm.
[206:04.64]Heads is... No.
[206:09.81]No, I'm gonna... Okay.
[206:14.53]Is it weird that I'm just going by how much I liked traversing the town?
[206:20.15]It has nothing to do with any of the stuff going on.
[206:23.61]It's just, which town do I think is more interesting to be, like, walk around in?
[206:34.39]Done.
[206:44.21]Power regulator is now safe to remove from botanical laboratory.
[206:48.25]Edgewater sawtuna cannery power regulator is now operating at optimal capacity.
[206:53.92]Okay.
[206:59.34]Alright.
[207:00.88]I did it.
[207:02.58]We did it.
[207:04.50]Now give me the power regulator.
[207:13.61]Thank you.
[207:16.61]Where is it?
[207:17.69]Give me this stuff first.
[207:22.21]It's behind a door.
[207:23.21]Hold on.
[207:25.21]Access the files.
[207:27.23]Access the files.
[207:30.17]Open the door.
[207:33.23]Where is the open door code?
[207:35.49]I don't know.
[207:40.45]Oh, I don't even need one.
[207:46.25]Uh, vending machine.
[207:48.39]No, I'm good.
[207:49.13]I'm good.
[207:51.97]Wait, where's the power?
[207:52.77]Where is it?
[207:53.49]Contrigger the power regulator?
[207:59.24]Is it outside?
[208:08.66]And he's wrong, is he?
[208:09.18]I don't know!
[208:39.93]Wait a minute.
[208:49.19]Alright, so, uh, where's the, uh... Oh, I have to go actually to the lab and go get it.
[208:54.42]Oh, I don't want to do that.
[208:56.20]I don't like that.
[208:57.90]I have to go... I have to go into the place that I just destroyed?
[209:06.74]I don't wanna do- I- I can't just like- there's not a core that I just take from inside the lab that's- I don't like this.
[209:12.12]I'm currently- I- I'm the- I'm stuck in the, like, person zoo here.
[209:22.88]You can't just text them to break up.
[209:26.49]Right, but... Are they gonna be hostile?
[209:46.86]It's alright.
[209:51.80]I'll just lie.
[209:55.20]Can I put my lie to 50 so I can just tell them I didn't do it?
[209:59.92]Their power got diverted somehow and I'm just coming to check on them.
[210:09.35]Your lights are still on.
[210:10.39]You're fine.
[210:21.05]Oh, that's not a good... That guy's got a rifle.
[210:36.09]Yeah.
[210:38.37]Fucked up what happened, I know.
[210:40.09]I heard the news.
[210:45.28]Everybody keeps staring at me.
[210:47.04]It's not my fault the power's dead.
[210:48.63]Yes, it is.
[210:48.95]You did it.
[210:49.29]This person did it.
[210:50.69]Whoa.
[210:50.93]Ms.
[210:51.17]Parvati.
[210:51.69]Who's this person here?
[210:52.71]You're... What?
[210:54.17]How are you?
[210:54.55]Hi.
[210:54.97]Hi.
[210:55.65]Hello.
[210:58.31]Are you... That's the beginning of every one of my streams.
[211:01.41]How are you keeping?
[211:02.68]That's how every intro starts.
[211:03.82]Great.
[211:04.14]Just great.
[211:05.08]I've been trying to keep stuff running.
[211:06.70]Just like you.
[211:08.06]Only I'm not so... Wait.
[211:10.54]they didn't kick you out did they oh gosh no I'm just along with this fella here I've seen you wandering around here you don't look like you're coming from town I'm just trying to get my ship off the ground never heard it phrased in such a way before I guess we're all trying to get our ships off the ground ain't we
[211:31.90]Sorry, I just wasn't sure if you were from town or if you were one of us.
[211:36.21]Something's been chewing at me, you see.
[211:38.13]What's wrong?
[211:39.05]Fact is, I've been, well, lying to everybody here.
[211:44.03]Camp thinks I'm a mechanical genius, but I couldn't fix a busted chair.
[211:47.75]Don't tell him.
[211:48.47]I like this.
[211:49.23]Okay, I like this guy.
[211:54.70]Never too late to start learning.
[211:55.72]I can give you a couple of pointers.
[211:57.14]We could both be lying idiot engineers.
[211:59.52]I'll take all the help I can get.
[212:01.74]I set my mind to learning the craft of the engineer, you see.
[212:04.98]I want to make something of myself.
[212:07.20]You ever heard of the Young Spacer's Guide to Mechanical Engineering?
[212:11.20]Comes in a set of three.
[212:12.94]If I had my hands on one of those data pads, I could teach myself the ins and outs.
[212:18.42]Those are good.
[212:19.86]My dad kept a copy with him when he was working in the cannery.
[212:23.26]I know the old community center kept the copy.
[212:25.89]Should find another one back in town.
[212:28.27]If you could find me even one of those pads, I'd be greatly obliged.
[212:32.33]One?
[212:37.40]Give me money, too.
[212:38.10]I'll pay you for every pad you bring me.
[212:40.56]If, by some miracle, you can bring me the full set, I'll give you something pretty I've been saving for a lucky day.
[212:48.44]Okay.
[212:49.74]What about the third one?
[212:50.66]Huh.
[212:50.78]But wait, you... Oh, you're gonna have to go to the town, right?
[212:53.54]You're gonna have to go to, uh... Edge...
[213:14.84]I don't remember the name of the town, I swear to God.
[213:17.15]Edge, don't tell me.
[213:17.75]I'm not gonna let this fuck me up.
[213:21.51]Edge... Stone Hedge.
[213:26.35]Stone Edge.
[213:27.19]Edge... Edge, uh, what was it called?
[213:35.04]Edge Hall?
[213:39.92]Edge... Edge Wood?
[213:43.82]Is it Edgewood?
[213:47.70]Edgewater!
[213:52.76]Edgewater.
[213:53.61]Right.
[213:53.95]You're all gonna be in Edgewater soon.
[214:03.67]Oh, wait, this is- I get to just take their power?
[214:08.13]That's the thing about growing old.
[214:10.47]Your eyes start to fail.
[214:13.13]Elsewise, I would have seen you for the snake that you are.
[214:16.15]Chopped you into pieces and roasted you on a spit.
[214:20.79]This is all you're doing.
[214:22.99]Cutting off my power, killing off my garden.
[214:26.37]Without refrigeration, my food will spoil and my flock will starve.
[214:32.54]I did call myself a snake.
[214:33.50]Lie.
[214:33.64]Give me a lie.
[214:34.64]Damn it.
[214:34.84]This isn't personal, Adelaide.
[214:35.64]I need your power regulator.
[214:36.38]I don't know.
[214:36.66]I like pressing buttons, I guess.
[214:52.91]Are you really this moronical, or are you just putting on airs?
[214:56.73]Listen here, hull-head... ...I'm only gonna say this once... ...go talk to Grace... ...and Thomas.
[215:03.58]Look them in the eye and tell them... ...their life here is over... ...and the only thing left to do is go back to Edgewater.
[215:11.06]This is now YOUR responsibility... ...and you tell Reed Thompson that I WILL NEVER return to Edgewater!
[215:19.03]I would rather die among my flowers than live under his management!
[215:23.76]Different scenario.
[215:24.66]What if I go back and kill Reed Thompson?
[215:28.30]And then you... I take over the town and I'll be nice to everybody.
[215:41.86]You offering to toss Reed off, huh?
[215:45.51]This some sort of twisted reparation for what you've done?
[215:48.05]Wait, what?
[215:48.45]I can do this?
[215:48.97]Or are you just looking for a chance to sow some chaos?
[215:52.93]kill reed if you must what talk him into leaving if you can he and I are not sharing the same four hold on am I doing a double cross on a double cross kill reed if you must what happened to you all this anger had to come from somewhere my son worked in that cannery when the plague started coming he was one of the first to fall sick
[216:20.13]Yeah, so we get rid of the bad guy, we unify everybody, and I run the place.
[216:23.49]Reed isn't just gonna... Alright, yeah, fine.
[216:57.73]from Edgewater.
[217:02.20]Okay.
[217:06.28]I think we got a deal.
[217:12.39]Okay, guys.
[217:13.09]Look.
[217:14.29]I got good news and bad news.
[217:16.79]Look.
[217:18.53]The good news is that you have to leave.
[217:21.13]The bad news is that I'm gonna kill Reed and I'm gonna be your boss.
[217:27.36]No, other way.
[217:28.04]Reverse that.
[217:28.54]Uh, go back to Edgewater.
[217:29.50]Oh, don't even, please.
[217:30.24]I don't want to do that quest.
[217:32.30]Ugh.
[217:59.17]Really?
[217:59.41]I have to do that?
[218:00.05]Who else do I need?
[218:05.69]I need to convince somebody else.
[218:09.82]Who else do I have to convince?
[218:11.82]I don't know how much longer we'll... I don't know how much longer we'll... Keep your wits about you.
[218:17.02]Keep your wits about you.
[218:18.50]Keep your wits about you.
[218:19.44]Stop copying each other!
[218:21.56]Clearly you heard her say that.
[218:24.33]Keep your wits about you.
[218:25.57]Keep your wits about you.
[218:26.87]Keep your wits about you.
[218:28.40]I don't know how much longer will last without power.
[218:30.32]Thank you.
[218:33.48]Any luck finding one of those manuals?
[218:37.14]Go back to Edgewater.
[218:38.60]I've been thinking about going back.
[218:40.78]I'm not much use to anybody here.
[218:43.38]I get sick thinking about working at the cannery.
[218:46.34]I can't do that again.
[218:47.50]Don't worry.
[218:47.90]I mentioned those manuals on mechanical engineering.
[218:51.30]Oh, come on.
[218:52.02]Suppose if I had one of those, I could go back to Reed and make a real case for myself.
[219:07.36]Alright, let's go get Zoe.
[219:09.20]You can't be far, right?
[219:10.04]Only 340... Only 343 feet.
[219:10.94]Kill Reed first.
[219:11.76]Well, I need the power regulator.
[219:12.66]Kill Reed, then kill her.
[219:46.38]They'll go back.
[219:49.62]Gilberte.
[219:51.32]Come back.
[219:51.88]Wow, you did it.
[219:52.64]Yup.
[219:55.58]That's just absolute chaos.
[220:00.14]Alright, so hold on.
[220:00.68]I'm not going to touch anything.
[220:01.73]I'm going to go get rid of Reed.
[220:02.77]Uh...
[220:10.15]Let's go get rid of Reed.
[220:10.99]Fuck, I'm a man of my word.
[220:18.61]I'm a man of my word.
[220:19.71]Temporarily.
[220:22.87]Right?
[220:23.24]So I'm gonna go get rid of Reed and I'm gonna come back.
[220:25.52]I did that.
[220:26.60]I told you I was gonna do that and I did.
[220:29.04]I also come up with new ideas on the fly.
[220:31.68]All the time.
[220:32.70]And second idea is get rid of you too.
[220:38.24]Just, it's, uh, temporarily.
[220:48.77]Alright, so.
[220:50.33]Reed.
[220:52.65]Now, what if I tell Reed about the plan that I'm coming to kill him?
[220:57.05]Could I double-cross the double-cross and then double-cross her and then come back and just double-cross again?
[221:02.45]Can I just bounce back and forth?
[221:09.99]What's going on?
[221:12.05]Oh, the- the- wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[221:13.79]Who are these people?
[221:22.74]What are they doing outside this town?
[221:29.95]What just happened?
[221:30.61]Why are they on the fucking main road?
[221:37.73]I just got double-crossed?
[221:52.76]Just fast travel?
[221:56.68]Fast travel didn't exist a hundred years ago, so no.
[222:05.29]Okay.
[222:05.81]You know, it comes a time when you have to understand that you'll... They're just in here.
[222:29.03]Cool.
[222:29.95]Take the money out of the register.
[222:34.40]You did that.
[222:34.86]I didn't.
[222:35.86]Holy shit, you're stealing.
[222:37.56]I didn't do it.
[222:38.10]Have you been watching me?
[222:57.66]I gotta make some armor stuff.
[223:01.50]Necklace.
[223:02.08]I can sell this shit too.
[223:04.14]Wait.
[223:06.40]I'm going in.
[223:09.39]I'm going in.
[223:16.35]Trespassing, lockpicking, hacking, and murder are all considered illegal activities.
[223:20.89]Avoid being seen if you want to engage in these activities.
[223:22.83]This place... Marauders.
[223:29.21]Tomato juice.
[223:30.31]Light ammo.
[223:34.41]Assault rifle.
[223:36.51]And the ammo.
[223:37.27]Alright, well, you got a lot of stuff here.
[223:38.73]I don't think it was worth it, though.
[223:54.76]Okay.
[223:55.22]Let's keep going.
[223:58.16]That was alright.
[224:01.49]It'll heal.
[224:05.51]OK.
[224:07.91]Alright, Reed.
[224:08.49]Got it.
[224:15.52]Inside voices.
[224:18.08]His head.
[224:25.20]Show me his head.
[224:35.62]You didn't do anything, actually.
[224:36.70]I did it.
[224:37.60]You watched.
[224:46.99]It was me.
[224:47.51]I did it.
[224:47.85]Okay.
[224:48.35]Alright, Reed.
[224:50.51]I'm not even gonna mess around.
[224:51.61]I'm just not... Should I even talk to him?
[224:53.91]Or should I just go in there and just... Just get him?
[225:13.58]Can't talk to a dead guy.
[225:14.83]Did you get it?
[225:23.60]Alright.
[225:26.36]Alright.
[225:29.98]Alright, Reed.
[225:32.63]We're in that tower.
[225:34.23]Yeah.
[225:37.78]Alright, Reed.
[225:38.48]You keep saying that.
[225:39.90]Alright, Reed.
[225:40.72]Alright, listen Reed.
[225:42.20]Alright, Reed.
[225:49.66]But what happens when I- do they- are they gonna know I killed them?
[226:00.73]Alright, what if I kill him and then just drop him outside the window?
[226:05.11]So it looks like he fell backwards through the glass and tripped and like broke through the glass.
[226:15.68]This is a fine day, friend.
[226:17.52]Power flows through our town like a cool stream of water.
[226:22.20]I trust Adelaide's people have seen their way to reason.
[226:24.88]So, when can I expect them back at their posts?
[226:31.11]I spoke to Adelaide.
[226:32.03]She won't come back as long as you're here.
[226:33.59]I delivered your message, but I haven't convinced Adelaide to come back.
[226:35.69]I want to ask you something.
[226:41.08]Go ahead.
[226:47.78]Have you taken a look around your town lately?
[226:49.62]Mm-hmm.
[227:00.59]Yeah.
[227:02.01]Your town's falling apart, Reed.
[227:05.23]I wish you wouldn't say things like that.
[227:08.43]Okay, I'm thinking real hard about it.
[227:13.23]I expect you wouldn't understand.
[227:15.21]You don't see the town as I do.
[227:17.92]When I stand at my window and look out over my town... So do it now.
[227:21.44]Here's what I see.
[227:23.02]I see decent, loyal, hardworking people.
[227:26.58]I see a family.
[227:28.21]We are all part of the Spacer's Choice family.
[227:30.85]We are all doing what we were brought into this world to do.
[227:38.57]This is a Spacer's Choice town.
[227:40.87]We're all part of the Spacer's Choice family here.
[227:44.13]The company keeps us warm, keeps us fed, keeps us working.
[227:49.62]Loyalty's got nothing to do with it, friend.
[227:52.16]This is good old-fashioned gratitude.
[227:58.83]How long have you worked here for?
[227:59.90]I'm trying to remember.
[228:00.78]25 years?
[228:02.00]26?
[228:03.36]When you get to my age, the years just rush by.
[228:06.52]You stop counting altogether.
[228:09.14]I remember looking out this window and seeing the veil spread out from horizon to horizon.
[228:15.62]We were a sprawling town.
[228:17.69]We were booming.
[228:18.55]This is a hitman talk.
[228:21.65]People change, but the veil will always be here.
[228:25.72]Spacer's choice will always be here.
[228:29.13]Our work won't ever end.
[228:30.75]I take comfort in that.
[228:53.83]How do I kill him without you guys knowing?
[228:58.82]What was your last break?
[229:05.23]I appreciate what you've done for us.
[229:12.84]I spoke to Adelaide.
[229:13.72]She won't be coming back as long as you are here.
[229:15.90]Then we are at an impasse.
[229:17.66]Stewardship over this town has been entrusted to me by Spacer's Choice.
[229:22.44]I am not perfect.
[229:23.82]I have made my share of mistakes.
[229:26.13]But I have done my best for this town.
[229:33.45]The town's terrified of the plague.
[229:34.81]Abernathy asked me to steal medicine for him.
[229:36.57]You let Adelaide's son die!
[229:42.15]Shit, shit, shit.
[229:43.01]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[229:43.81]We're getting bad guy exposition actually is not bad guy.
[229:46.57]Make you... Liar.
[230:12.88]Maybe it's time for you to step down.
[230:14.72]I'm a spacer's choice man.
[230:16.76]My father was a spacer's choice man.
[230:19.10]Edgewater may not look like much to some buttoned up freelancer.
[230:23.36]But it is my home.
[230:24.52]And you made fun of me.
[230:26.92]Attack.
[230:27.54]Well, I tried.
[230:28.55]What?
[230:31.47]Do I say that?
[230:33.21]Attack.
[230:38.43]Why don't you think about this?
[230:42.00]I gotta think about this.
[230:53.29]What a great time to learn about companion perks.
[231:02.54]What?
[231:03.40]You just killed him.
[231:12.46]Killed who?
[231:12.90]Who?
[231:13.48]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[231:15.20]Reed was... Get lost!
[231:16.18]Where did she go?
[231:16.98]She can't just teleport out.
[231:56.41]That's the bad end?
[231:57.25]Well, hold on.
[231:59.84]Let me see what's in Reed's personal, like, weapons stash.
[232:03.72]Holy shit.
[232:07.32]I'll take it.
[232:10.74]She knows too much.
[232:17.50]Welcome, R. Thompson.
[232:18.70]From R- He sends himself an email.
[232:21.60]If you are reading this, then I am no longer the outpost administrator for Edgewater.
[232:24.94]Whether through the shedding of my mortal coil for natural causes or through early retirement.
[232:29.78]Passed on to somebody else.
[232:30.66]You.
[232:32.02]Most importantly, it is imperative that you keep the Spacer's Choice family together.
[232:36.57]Adelaide McDevitt and her followers have taken camp in the old botanical lab.
[232:40.75]Their place is here working with us.
[232:43.75]Adelaide is impervious to reason and refuses to entertain diplomatic overtures.
[232:51.21]The only way to introduce her and come back is by hitting the plant, cutting off power, and leading her people back to Edgewater.
[232:55.55]With the power shut off, I feel like... Okay.
[233:00.53]Incorporate.
[233:01.87]Your request for additional building materials has been denied.
[233:04.15]The walls around Edgewater were built 30 years ago by my predecessor, sir.
[233:09.55]Any alterations, expansions, or repairs to this wall must be signed and approved by your predecessor.
[233:13.01]If your predecessor... It is your responsibility to obtain a last will and testament demonstrating your predecessor's intentions.
[233:24.75]So wait, is she gone?
[233:25.49]I can't even get the hat.
[233:36.77]No, that was just like an in the moment.
[233:38.33]Like, get away, get away, get out of here.
[233:43.39]It's in his storage.
[233:48.19]Oh, fuck, it's a hat.
[233:55.31]lost but are they gonna tell everybody I gotta put the hat on now because I'm you now nine armor what is this four nine what's this one do it's a helmet can I just have a helmet I'm gonna have two helmets on no no this is better now I'm the villain she's not gonna come back
[234:23.23]Well... Shit.
[234:28.81]I think I have to sleep in this bed.
[234:31.66]I yelled at her.
[234:36.02]I have a hat bell.
[234:36.87]Yeah.
[234:49.64]Uh, what do I want to do?
[234:50.56]Uh, let's get this to 50 or 60.
[234:53.12]What do I want?
[234:58.08]40.
[234:58.26]One line.
[235:08.07]Yeah.
[235:16.55]Okay, activate it.
[235:22.72]Uh, yeah, I... No, I don't think I can reload.
[235:27.08]That's cheating.
[235:30.30]I said what I said.
[235:32.18]I said, get lost, because... And I think that's cheating.
[235:38.18]In a game where you have choices that you have to make, I feel like reverting on one of those choices is kind of going against the nature of the game.
[235:51.92]That's the only likeable character in the game.
[235:53.82]Is that true?
[236:01.27]That can't be true.
[236:22.54]Alright.
[236:23.72]I've delivered Reed's message.
[236:35.13]So what do I want to do now?
[236:44.02]Let's see.
[236:44.48]Find Zoe.
[236:45.08]Find the three volumes.
[236:49.39]companion max says the journal was wait a minute hold on companion that guy's a companion oh shit hey well we get a new friend
[237:28.94]Oh man, that's fucking funny.
[237:32.07]Alright, let's go get this, uh, this book.
[237:57.78]Kill them both.
[237:58.46]I still haven't decided what I'm gonna do.
[237:59.88]I'm contemplating.
[238:07.55]Give me a rock for cover.
[238:29.88]How do I know when they're all dead?
[238:31.16]I wish I had my companion that says, that's the last of them.
[238:45.64]She'll be back.
[238:47.75]She'll be back.
[238:48.47]Alright, here we go.
[239:03.39]Collector's Domicile.
[239:06.91]Alright.
[239:07.93]Time for a new... Guys, we're gonna have a new companion.
[239:12.66]Are you ready?
[239:14.48]We're gonna get the priest.
[239:15.34]He probably has magic powers.
[239:22.82]I just got the letter today.
[239:23.78]Corporate ordered me to relocate to the Edgewater Cannery.
[239:26.92]Effective immediately.
[239:28.90]It's a shame.
[239:29.50]I was really looking forward to running my own gift shop at the community center, selling rare memorabilia.
[239:34.36]But scripture tells us that all things happen for a reason.
[239:37.51]Work fortifies the spirit and all.
[239:39.85]As for my book collection, I can't bear to part with it.
[239:42.09]Don't want those books malding in some contraband bunker like chat currently is over the loss of their favorite character who they deem to be the only likable person in the game.
[239:53.94]But I find that to be an untrue statement.
[239:55.44]So I stashed them all the way in a cave by the river.
[239:58.36]No, I didn't do that to chat members.
[240:00.34]I stashed the books.
[240:06.77]I threw them all in a river.
[240:10.68]Retrieve the journal.
[240:11.46]Let's go.
[240:14.93]Read these messages.
[240:17.49]You think the corporation's here.
[240:20.67]From Eldritch.
[240:23.33]Screenshot it.
[240:23.91]Read it later.
[240:32.87]To be honest, it's rare to see a playthrough that doesn't have Pivarti.
[240:39.84]We're on rare playthrough now, guys.
[240:52.18]You are encumbered!
[240:54.08]Oh no.
[240:54.74]Of course I am.
[240:58.26]Alright, let's eat a bunch of food.
[241:01.57]Just eat the bag of bread.
[241:05.17]Okay, where's my, uh, list here?
[241:07.33]83 out of 80.
[241:07.99]Eat some canned tuna.
[241:10.95]Have a, um, bring some drink.
[241:15.11]Just drink.
[241:18.63]Uh, what else do I have?
[241:19.49]Break some stuff down.
[241:20.37]I got, like, five trip blades.
[241:38.83]142, 130.
[241:39.63]This is Shock, though.
[241:53.63]Tactical shotgun!
[241:54.59]What do I have this on?
[241:59.07]Is this a long gun?
[242:01.44]Yeah.
[242:07.05]Light machine gun.
[242:07.99]Is it a long gun?
[242:09.20]No, it's heavy weapons.
[242:09.98]But it's not bad.
[242:11.92]Okay, whatever.
[242:12.54]Ooh, hunting rifle.
[242:13.60]Look at that.
[242:14.30]Long gun?
[242:14.90]Yep.
[242:15.52]Cool.
[242:26.16]Nice.
[242:26.44]Alright, let's go.
[242:32.80]How many viewers did he lose by not resetting?
[242:39.83]I don't know.
[242:42.41]How many viewers did he lose?
[243:01.38]I can't believe he told Vardy to get out of here.
[243:07.24]I... That's a... It was shiny and purple.
[243:09.72]I thought it was... I don't know.
[243:10.88]Something to look at.
[243:11.58]I just got killed by an insect bug repeller zap thing.
[243:18.95]Oh, shit.
[243:19.85]Let's get it open.
[243:26.07]Journal.
[243:27.53]Alright.
[243:29.71]New companion.
[243:30.41]See?
[243:30.69]Nothing's even... Who cares?
[243:31.81]Nothing's wrong.
[243:34.94]Not everybody has to have the same companion.
[243:48.21]We're gonna get... We're gonna get this guy.
[244:00.00]Just wait until he does his first magic spell.
[244:03.14]And I think everyone's gonna have their minds changed.
[244:04.80]This guy's gonna cast fireballs and shit, and you guys are... Oh, this guy's awesome, actually.
[244:33.50]He's gonna be casting fireballs, ice bolts, shadow bolts.
[244:40.18]Isn't that magic in this game?
[244:42.08]If you've come to ask forgiveness for Reed Thompson's murder, I'm afraid OSI theology has little to say on the matter.
[244:48.45]Wait, does everybody know I killed him?
[244:54.07]What are you talking about?
[244:54.65]A murderer?
[244:56.45]I didn't do anything.
[244:58.66]I was told it was a stranger come to town.
[245:01.62]I see no other strangers about.
[245:03.89]But the workers of Edgewater may not be the most reliable witnesses.
[245:07.21]Of course, how dare you?
[245:08.29]You know what?
[245:08.65]How dare you accuse me of something like that?
[245:14.93]I should leave.
[245:15.67]I should just leave.
[245:16.27]I mean, I got your book, but I should get out of here.
[245:18.23]No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[245:19.47]This is fantastic.
[245:20.95]Well worth all the sacrifices I... Wait.
[245:24.94]What the fuck is this?
[245:26.50]Is this French?
[245:28.58]I can't fucking read French.
[245:31.31]It's a law-forsaken joke is what it is.
[245:34.13]French!
[245:35.25]Ha!
[245:36.19]I was so high and mighty, preaching to the yokels about following the plan while fighting it at every turn.
[245:43.19]You guys said this guy sucks?
[245:44.67]Are you sure?
[245:46.27]He's fucking nuts.
[245:51.90]You're overreacting a bit, don't you think?
[245:53.88]Over... overreacting?
[245:56.60]Do you have any idea how many years I spent in...
[246:01.77]He's a fraud.
[246:03.47]So am I. Liar of liars?
[246:29.61]Both... I mean, is he... are you into medicine?
[246:33.47]I think I'm going to get along just fine.
[246:37.21]At least still have your mission work here to give you a meaningful purpose.
[246:39.83]Why did you think the book held the secrets you were looking for?
[246:41.77]This has to be some kind of cosmic retribution.
[246:46.89]Why do you think it has secrets?
[246:48.47]The author had some interesting theories about man's perception of reality that I thought could be applied to our attempts to decipher the plan.
[246:56.89]Unfortunately, he was also one of the founders of the Philosophist School of Thought, so the book is banned in this colony.
[247:08.31]A vicar searching for a banned book, that's a bad example.
[247:15.66]The story of my life.
[247:17.60]Most laypeople are not aware of this, but we've not discovered any new insights into the plan for a long, long time.
[247:26.89]I had an idea that we should welcome the truth, no matter where we found it.
[247:31.27]I had the worst idea to share my thoughts with a superior.
[247:35.17]And that's how I ended up assigned prison duty, where I was fool enough to let an inmate bend my ear with stories of an original Bokonu journal.
[247:43.86]Why wouldn't they arrest me?
[247:49.22]What is that?
[247:50.56]Philosophism's a false religion that stands in contradiction to almost everything we know to be true.
[247:56.70]They believe all is chaos, in stark contrast to OSI's belief in the plan.
[248:01.76]Where's their place at?
[248:02.32]Where's their hideout?
[248:02.82]But most of the philosophist perversion of Bakonu's thoughts came more than a century after his death.
[248:08.56]But that's neither here nor there.
[248:10.55]What I need to do now is to find a translator, obviously.
[248:13.69]But to do that, I'll first need to secure transport.
[248:16.67]I got you.
[248:17.61]You have a ship.
[248:18.91]Perhaps I could make myself of use to your crew.
[248:20.95]Yeah, I think so.
[248:23.85]You need to ride out of town, I wouldn't mind a ship hand.
[248:28.88]certainly I already gave you most of my money but I can offer you free spiritual counseling and I'd be happy to watch your back okay that sounds like a great idea toss ball stick or any blunt instrument really I'm also a passable gun hand if it comes to that I can usually talk my way out of conflict though yep that's this is oh this is my I'm fairly competent at hacking computers as well and he's a computer hacker is that all part of your training
[248:59.84]Let's go.
[249:00.22]Nice.
[249:00.85]Nice.
[249:01.29]Alright, we got a new companion.
[249:02.81]Alright, now let's return to... We have to do Zoe, right?
[249:05.73]Find Zoe.
[249:32.18]Actually, not that far away.
[249:33.14]Where are you?
[249:42.16]Now Max is my best friend.
[249:49.17]Wait, I can come back to this guy.
[249:51.95]I have the thing for you.
[249:55.37]Hi, Ludwig.
[249:57.99]Never seen the veil lit up like this before.
[250:01.51]You mentioned a logic module.
[250:02.77]I found one.
[250:04.68]Bang up, work soldier.
[250:06.26]You're a credit to your uniform.
[250:08.70]Oh, that reminds me.
[250:10.82]Got a look into getting us a uniform.
[250:13.97]So this is it then.
[250:16.09]The key to humanity's victory over the mechanical hordes.
[250:20.45]I would reward you with the gratitude of the resistance, but I'm guessing you want something tactile.
[250:26.69]So here's a couple bits for your trouble.
[250:29.65]And a little something to remember me by.
[250:32.08]And a shock stick?
[250:33.88]Ooh.
[250:35.48]Cool, thanks.
[250:36.10]I'm kidding.
[250:42.28]Let me see what that is.
[250:45.88]One-handed.
[250:46.40]Cool.
[250:46.84]Shock stick.
[250:52.32]I'll put it on in place of this.
[250:56.48]Check it out.
[251:02.40]Loud weapon.
[251:03.52]Cool.
[251:05.36]Alright.
[251:07.40]He's always far away.
[251:08.50]Damn.
[251:17.49]Now put that into the trash.
[251:20.13]Why would I do that?
[251:22.29]Fast travel.
[251:26.07]Fast travel!
[251:41.10]Fast travel!
[251:43.09]Fine.
[251:48.81]Is this the entire map?
[251:55.18]no probably not it's probably different areas different planets it's not the entire game this guys this game is like two to three hundred hours long just to do these story missions if you did them as fast as possible the whole game takes about 700 hours to complete
[252:34.89]Alright, let's scout it out.
[252:38.69]I knew that was gonna happen, it's okay.
[252:43.19]Eat something.
[252:49.78]I'm gonna be encumbered again, aren't I?
[252:54.62]Speedrun stream?
[252:57.24]Nah!
[252:58.94]Nah.
[253:11.33]This thing's fucking amazing.
[253:12.37]Alright, I'm only gonna use sniper rifle now.
[253:24.72]Oh!
[253:24.98]That's a lot of people!
[253:44.01]What's going on?
[253:48.97]Did I get a dog friend?
[253:52.55]It's going in.
[253:57.61]Where did it go?
[253:58.19]I think I just heard it die.
[254:06.36]Nope.
[254:08.34]Oh no, that's their dog.
[254:09.82]Okay, I gotta be accurate.
[254:28.92]That's gonna kill me, isn't it?
[254:47.25]Oh shit, they're after me.
[255:15.53]What's that?
[255:16.15]That's why they ran away.
[255:28.60]Okay, new plan.
[255:29.96]We're gonna stealth into this room.
[255:52.96]Alright, this way, around the back.
[255:54.66]I just have to go in there and talk to Zoe.
[256:07.25]Oh, come on.
[256:11.17]You see anybody?
[256:13.62]Why don't I have a button that I can press in every action game ever made after 2014?
[256:17.10]To go... And see everything through the walls, see every interactable object, and see all people in all things.
[256:27.09]That I can activate every five seconds.
[256:30.05]The fuck?
[256:41.39]They...
[256:48.19]He tripped on his own mind.
[256:52.38]Why does that detect me?
[256:56.29]Doesn't that make no sense?
[257:16.11]Alright, well, let's try this again.
[257:17.45]This time, I hope they don't trip their own minds.
[257:24.27]I'm gonna go this way.
[257:35.15]Don't do it.
[257:35.65]Where's this dog?
[257:57.71]Oh f- no!
[258:01.61]I'm fine.
[258:04.25]Nobody got alerted.
[258:04.95]Alright, I'm in.
[258:27.87]I hear running.
[258:35.67]Alright.
[258:45.20]Zoe!
[258:45.38]Zoe!
[258:46.76]Zoe!
[258:57.19]Get me out.
[258:58.03]Get me out.
[258:58.43]Get me out.
[259:01.05]Fuck.
[259:14.26]Watch out for the lava.
[259:15.00]Watch out for the lava.
[259:21.87]What do you mean I need proof?
[259:23.33]Find proof on Zoe's corpse?
[259:26.51]You found Zoe then promptly killed her.
[259:28.79]You could probably tell Grace you found her that way, but you should probably see if you can find anything on Zoe's corpse that Grace might.
[259:34.29]Oh, come on.
[259:36.75]What?
[259:37.05]Now I have to sneak back in.
[259:42.75]I have to sneak back in the compound to take something.
[259:50.83]Okay, hold on.
[259:58.86]I have new perks.
[260:01.04]And new skills.
[260:04.38]I need to do... Hold on.
[260:07.39]Let's get some more medical.
[260:09.51]20.
[260:11.49]20 medical is a... I can do... I can mix drugs together and... Take them.
[260:15.78]I don't know.
[260:17.68]Dial
[260:20.63]So now scramble duration is plus 7 seconds.
[260:23.79]Terrify's error effect is 100%.
[260:24.93]And let's go back into ranged.
[260:27.91]Oh, wait a minute.
[260:28.87]Yeah, I want 50 for long guns too.
[260:32.80]That works.
[260:34.96]Hurts.
[260:36.60]Alright, how
[260:50.08]That one's not bad.
[260:52.16]Vendor prices.
[260:55.73]Carry capacity.
[260:58.13]Yeah.
[260:59.01]Oh, the walk speed?
[261:00.03]No, carry capacity.
[261:01.03]Let's do it.
[261:08.24]Alright.
[261:10.58]Let's see if I can get in here.
[262:29.99]Oh my god.
[262:30.73]Jesus.
[262:58.31]I can't be trusted.
[263:01.98]Ugh, alright.
[263:03.88]We're good.
[263:10.04]This is too many people.
[263:16.00]Just run.
[263:21.03]Don't break my fucking legs, please.
[263:23.39]Oh my fucking god.
[263:25.35]Where did I save it?
[263:33.62]Good.
[263:33.86]Right here.
[263:43.94]Alright, we're good.
[263:47.63]I don't want to fight him.
[263:52.37]Just shoot better.
[263:53.43]Omega lul.
[263:55.11]Just shoot better.
[263:55.85]Omega lul.
[263:58.88]It's not, it's not omega LOL worthy if I miss a shot, okay?
[264:04.10]That's just regular LUL worthy.
[264:06.24]I have to go in the front door or can I just wrap around all the way?
[264:28.85]Can I get in the back?
[264:32.15]I should be able to, right?
[264:33.57]Can I not get around here?
[264:37.01]Fast travel.
[264:37.97]You cannot travel at this time.
[264:39.15]Why?
[264:42.22]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[264:43.28]I don't want to... Yeah, I do.
[264:49.16]Are there any Omega Lulls in chat?
[264:54.68]Alright, here you go.
[264:55.97]Wait.
[264:57.47]How much is this worth?
[265:10.51]No price.
[265:17.66]I'm not in the lightest of humors right now.
[265:22.71]He's always not coming back.
[265:24.95]You want to expand on that?
[265:27.03]Yes.
[265:33.96]She went feral.
[265:34.92]I had to put her down.
[265:36.76]I was hoping you wouldn't say that.
[265:39.22]I was really hoping.
[265:41.44]You'd better not be spinning me a story.
[265:47.83]I can bring back her body if you want.
[265:49.93]Might have to make a few trips.
[265:51.37]Jesus.
[265:52.95]Yeah, that belonged to her well enough.
[265:56.29]Guess there's no arguing with you.
[265:58.91]You pretty much did my job for me.
[266:02.16]I got money for that, too.
[266:10.34]Thanks.
[266:11.76]Yes, uh, there is something you can do.
[266:13.82]It's time for you to go home.
[266:18.84]Alright, uh, I gotta find this guy's book.
[266:22.62]But, but, but, but, unfortunately, it's time to turn the stream off.
[266:32.46]If you weren't here earlier, I'm shaving some time off of the streams this week to prepare for a couple things.
[266:40.02]Thanksgiving is going to be moved around a little bit because I'm streaming on Thanksgiving.
[266:44.70]And I have an upper endoscopy this week too.
[266:50.40]So I need to, I have to like go on a little bit of a change diet.
[266:54.58]I have some procedure shit to do.
[266:57.28]So this week is a little busy.
[267:00.80]I'm going to stream the next three days in a row.
[267:02.44]I'm streaming on Thanksgiving too.
[267:04.30]But the streams are going to be like four to five hours each.
[267:09.53]So... We're going to play... I feel like I'm just getting into it now.
[267:20.83]I've had an upper endoscopy.
[267:22.19]It's kind of neat.
[267:23.80]Well, I had a colonoscopy a few months ago and we're going the other way this time.
[267:29.04]But... So...
[267:32.85]That's going to be the end here.
[267:34.43]We're going to transition out to the bits and everything.
[267:37.95]See you tomorrow.
[267:38.39]We're going to do the same thing.
[267:39.14]We're going to pick up right where we left off right here.
[267:40.68]I feel like I'm, like I said, I'm just getting barely into it now.
[267:44.54]So bear with me this week while obviously holiday stuff and a medical procedure have to take some precedence.
[267:53.53]So streams will be shaved.
[267:58.38]But, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[267:59.56]I'm going to actually do a hard save here.
[268:02.70]Because I have not done it once the whole game.
[268:05.10]So that would be nice.
[268:09.20]First impressions so far.
[268:13.64]Feels like... Feels like there's... I don't know if this is a... It might just be talking complete bullshit here in the first few hours of the game.
[268:26.63]But...
[268:28.80]there it seems like there are I I thought there weren't going to be that many interesting choices but it seems like there are I didn't mean killing the guy like that's something you can do it seems like there's a couple of optional things you can do for each major mission which is kind of interesting I guess it does feel like it may have
[268:56.84]Maybe if they had an extra year or two, it'd be expanded on.
[269:01.18]But I don't know yet.
[269:01.90]I don't know.
[269:03.74]We'll see.
[269:09.37]But I'm interested enough to play it again tomorrow.
[269:21.50]It's more limited than I was hoping for.
[269:23.00]Just more Fallout-type choices.
[269:25.98]Yeah, it's kind of hard to pass judgment on a game like this in the first three or four hours.
[269:32.06]So a couple of interesting things just happened.
[269:35.80]So, oh, alright.
[269:36.89]That's pretty fucking cool.
[269:37.99]Some interesting developments.
[269:39.85]You can kill this person.
[269:40.83]You can kill that person.
[269:41.67]You can do their mission.
[269:42.45]You can cut off the power.
[269:43.35]I mean, that's cool.
[269:46.31]But we'll see if it continues.
[269:50.81]But I cannot pass judgment on it yet.
[269:53.07]I feel like it's too early.
[269:56.50]But there you go.
[269:57.84]That's kind of what I think.
[270:01.66]We'll see how I feel tomorrow.
[270:04.07]I'll see you tomorrow.
[270:04.99]Let's transition to the bits.
[270:07.33]Thanks for joining me, everybody.
[270:09.67]See you tomorrow.
[270:10.23]Have a great night.
[270:12.21]Same time, same place.
[270:20.01]You don't play games.
[270:20.71]You're just too terrible for it to count as playing.
[270:23.46]I beat the last boss, the last true boss in Sekiro in under 100 tries.
[270:28.66]Just, I mean, I'm just going to throw that out there.
[270:31.82]Have you done that yet?
[270:32.94]Did you do that yet?
[270:38.40]Have you done that?
[270:38.86]I just need to know.
[270:45.38]I actually did that.
[270:46.32]I mean, yeah, I'm talking to one guy.
[270:56.03]I'll see you tomorrow.
[271:04.12]Let's do the bits.
[271:04.70]Let me quit out of here so I can pull this over.
[271:14.23]One omega...
[271:15.98]I don't know why I go mega LOL.
[271:17.54]I just I think it's so funny.
[271:20.16]I love that emo because it's such it could it could be used legitimately or as a total overreaction to anything.
[271:28.26]It's great.
[271:29.98]It has so many uses.
[271:39.93]Why is it funnier than L-U-L?
[271:41.81]It just... It's because it's supposed to... There's a lot of layers there.
[271:52.44]But anyways, let's do the... Let's get the music rolling here.
[271:56.80]Thanks again for joining me.
[271:57.46]Thank you, Sad Vega, for the $2.50.
[272:00.29]I thought we were calling the 2019 Jerma Awards the Jermies.
[272:06.13]I don't know what the hell to call it.
[272:11.25]If that's loud, I'll turn it down.
[272:17.17]The Jermies, huh?
[272:19.16]Maybe.
[272:23.66]I look forward to it, though.
[272:25.92]I can't wait to see what the nominations could be.
[272:32.41]It's just fun.
[272:33.71]I can't wait.
[272:36.79]But that's not yet.
[272:37.99]That's going to happen second half, obviously, of December.
[272:40.75]So we have a lot of other things to think about first.
[272:46.20]Hey, Spunky Spade, thanks for the thousand bits.
[272:47.92]If I give you my bits, will you leave my rats alone?
[272:51.00]I have nothing to do with your rats.
[272:53.86]I'll take the thousand bits, but I have nothing to do with those rats.
[272:56.46]I didn't do anything to your rats.
[272:59.49]Yes, I will leave your rats alone because from the very beginning I was not I was leaving them alone in the first place So you got your wish Thanks for the thousand bits.
[273:07.16]Appreciate it.
[273:07.60]Seriously Uh, wait, does this work I say this every stream let's see if it worked No It's always like four streams behind
[273:29.76]I don't know why.
[273:30.40]It doesn't make any sense.
[273:35.22]Doesn't work.
[273:40.03]Thank you, LightsNotOn, thanks for the $2.50.
[273:44.53]Jeremy, just a month ago, I lost my iPhone SE, and I heard your SE rant at the end of the Dead Rising stream.
[273:51.99]Rip both our SEs, I guess.
[273:54.13]This cheers in memory of them.
[273:55.73]Oh, and it's LightsNotOn.
[273:58.45]Got it.
[273:58.93]I got it.
[274:01.20]I wish I could get a fucking S, a brand new SE sealed with no tracking device bug on it.
[274:05.94]It'd be amazing.
[274:11.58]I wanted an SE so bad.
[274:17.38]And let's do the credits.
[274:19.15]Camera's not on, right?
[274:21.15]Just in case it is.
[274:21.65]It's not.
[274:26.09]Thank you, all the subs.
[274:28.38]Welcome back to all of the longtime subs and welcome for the first time.
[274:35.32]Welcome for the first time.
[274:38.29]All the new ones.
[274:39.77]Thanks.
[274:42.01]Something that needs to be said about the Minecraft King stream.
[274:47.41]This is very important and it's a decision that I did not make lightly.
[274:52.55]Actually, this is really, really important.
[274:54.01]Kill the music for a second.
[274:57.05]I don't think I talked too much about this, but of all the things that we talked about at the beginning of the stream, the thing that is absolutely number one for like true for everything is set in stone.
[275:09.57]It's going to be a sub only server with potential Twitch integration.
[275:14.19]Like you need to verify your Twitch ID and you have to be more than one month sub.
[275:22.36]And the reason why we're doing that is
[275:26.04]because Minecraft is probably the easiest video game on Earth to script and destroy like a whole stream so it has to be that way it's going to be a multi-month sub only and the reason why it has to be multi-month is because if it was just sub only
[275:54.34]Somebody could just sub and then come in.
[275:58.78]And that's, you know, hey, $5, here you go.
[276:02.50]Take it.
[276:02.82]I'm coming in.
[276:07.00]So just need to be, we're going to try to protect the server in quotes, I guess, as best as we can.
[276:14.67]So that's the way.
[276:15.23]That is absolutely set in stone.
[276:19.37]But there's still some bits to do.
[276:22.99]We have...
[276:26.65]uh sad vega thanks for the 250 this is the best dumb rp playthrough I've ever seen you really nailed the role of being an idiot down to full chat my character is not even stupid though he's an engineer he's a medic he's a scientist and he's a liar you have to be smart to lie well
[276:54.08]Freudian weapon, thanks for the two-fifth.
[276:56.06]No, that's not 250.
[276:57.24]It's 250 times one, two, three, four, five.
[277:00.34]Thanks for the thousand bits, Freudian.
[277:05.09]Appreciate the ten bucks.
[277:06.93]Though some choices you made may have infuriated me.
[277:09.17]Watching you play this was thoroughly entertaining.
[277:11.95]Happy Thanksgiving and good luck with the endoscopy.
[277:16.82]I appreciate that.
[277:17.34]Thank you.
[277:19.59]The endoscopy is at the end of this week, but for a few days before I infuriated For a few days before the procedure I have to I can't eat certain foods and I have to kind of the day before I can't eat anything Well the night before whatever so I'm gonna be all kind of trying to change the way that I eat stuff And then obviously I'm gonna be on drugs for the procedures, so I'm gonna be kind of all over the place
[277:51.93]so that's uh it's all good though only eat nuts and fruits uh oh you mean only nuts and fruits well from my understanding it's anything that has skin on it no corn no peas no nuts no um fruits especially like berries I just have to be careful no beans
[278:19.84]Anytime I have a procedure like this, I always kind of get a little paranoid that I'm going to do something wrong.
[278:25.32]I also don't, I can't take any anti-inflammatory medication.
[278:29.05]Like I can't take any like Advil or something or aspirin, I don't think.
[278:33.08]Just be careful.
[278:41.10]And this ain't the first time I've had to do something like this, so it's not like I'm nervous about it, but, you know, anytime that you have anything like this going on, you... Anytime where I'm gonna lie on a table and I'm gonna get put unconscious and someone's going to, like, do, like, things, you know, like, medical, like, I just get kind of, like, not nervous, but obviously it's understandable, like, I have to get put under.
[279:06.72]So it's like I have to go under anesthesia and have like a doctor fucking do like a scope.
[279:12.95]So it just kind of creeps me out in a way, you know?
[279:24.13]But.
[279:25.88]No, that's the wrong music.
[279:29.54]I'll see you tomorrow.
[279:34.24]I feel the same.
[279:34.80]I have arthritis and I've been too... been too... been too many times for my age.
[279:42.25]Yeah, I just don't... I don't like the anesthesia drugs.
[279:45.75]I just don't.
[279:46.21]There's something about them.
[279:49.65]There's this chemical that they can put into you that turns you off and then turns you back on.
[279:57.02]It's... It just rubs me the wrong way.
[280:07.53]But you know, you gotta do what you gotta do.
[280:17.77]It was a huge medical breakthrough.
[280:19.37]Yeah, it absolutely is one of the most unbelievable discoveries of modern history.
[280:27.00]Is being able to go inside people and fix stuff without them even knowing.
[280:33.30]And obviously they know they're there, but how the fuck do you even come up with that?
[280:43.77]how who what's the what's the process there to even figure that out such remarkable medical and technological advances how did we come up with this they used to just use alcohol yeah remarkable but that's my time guys sorry again for these shorter streams uh this week
[281:15.56]But I have to go help prep for Thanksgiving.
[281:22.84]And other stuff.
[281:32.27]Don't read.
[281:32.87]Don't read that negative comment.
[281:34.11]Don't read it, Jerma.
[281:35.02]You only read the negative comments.
[281:36.32]Don't read it.
[281:36.92]Out loud.
[281:37.36]Don't read it.
[281:37.76]You suck, Jerma.
[281:39.00]Fuck.
[281:41.38]I shouldn't have read that.
[281:49.37]Good night, guys.
[281:49.73]I'll see you tomorrow.
[281:50.85]Have a great rest of your night.
[282:34.91]you
