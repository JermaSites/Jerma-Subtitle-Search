[00:00.89]Does anyone dare to challenge me?
[00:03.14]Figures.
[00:04.64]What is that?
[00:05.92]Rips the hilt of my... Hey, how you doing everybody?
[00:11.87]Welcome.
[00:14.47]Welcome to the stream.
[00:18.69]Oh, Gamer has logged in.
[00:23.18]On time.
[00:25.98]Why do people get... Why do people resident sleeper when I'm on time?
[00:31.89]Is it because you like hanging out in the chat so much?
[00:35.31]And you like chatting without me here?
[00:36.81]I can... I understand that.
[00:42.83]You're 15 minutes early?
[00:44.13]No, no, no, no.
[00:45.11]I am 15 minutes now.
[00:47.53]It is now.
[00:49.20]There is no late between 3 and 4 p.m.
[00:52.28]There is only now.
[00:53.96]If it was 4 p.m., 4.01, that's late.
[00:55.56]If it was 2.59, that's early.
[00:56.58]3 to 4, now.
[01:05.95]There is only late.
[01:07.25]Alright, give me one second.
[01:09.87]I'm gonna make a tweet, and we're gonna talk about some stuff.
[01:11.66]We're gonna go on a little stuff talk.
[01:14.82]Not very long.
[01:15.34]Maybe like five minutes.
[01:16.34]Not even.
[01:17.26]Not even.
[01:17.58]I'll be right back.
[02:30.95]Okay.
[02:32.75]So, I was talking with your mother last night.
[02:35.87]And we have decided that we're gonna bring this up in a respectful, nice way.
[02:40.63]We didn't want to, you know, alarm you or anything.
[02:43.77]But your mother and I were cleaning up the house.
[02:49.11]And we found a bag of marijuana.
[02:54.94]And it's... I know it's not mine.
[02:57.10]It's not hers.
[02:59.28]And we've already talked to Jacob about this.
[03:01.88]So we're just coming to you in hopes that you can maybe shed some light on what this is.
[03:21.40]I learned from watching you.
[03:25.98]Well, the character, listen, and this is tough.
[03:29.42]I know that, you know, you're 14, and it's tough to understand, but that's a character that I play on television.
[03:36.36]The character, it's not real.
[03:41.44]I'm an actor, and I play a character that's, think of it like recess.
[03:46.77]When I go out and I do recess with other people doing recess, and it's filmed, and then it's put out as if it was real.
[03:56.73]You know, my stoner personality that I put on that show is not something you should be doing.
[04:05.11]He's RPing with chat.
[04:06.69]Yeah, what the fuck am I doing?
[04:08.51]I am like, we're just like role-playing.
[04:16.98]But how are you?
[04:17.60]Hope you're doing well.
[04:19.00]What we were really going to talk about...
[04:25.26]Today.
[04:26.42]What's happening today?
[04:27.65]Look.
[04:29.41]This is what's happening today.
[04:30.95]Gonna do Might and Magic again.
[04:32.27]We're dialing it up to a million.
[04:36.45]We are going to do an 8v8v.
[04:42.49]No holds barred.
[04:44.53]Large map.
[04:48.82]I ain't fucking around today.
[04:50.84]I've already picked who, and the music's not even on.
[04:54.02]What kind of streamer am I?
[04:56.50]Drop the house lights, please.
[04:59.64]Thank you.
[05:01.52]And... bring it up a little bit.
[05:05.17]There it is.
[05:07.49]So today, we're gonna- I've decided I'm gonna be green again.
[05:14.15]You guys aren't even... You can't dance to this music.
[05:17.25]All you can do is put your hands in the air and move them like this.
[05:21.96]I can't fucking turn the webcam on.
[05:23.88]My hands are in the air with my... Okay, I'm gonna describe it.
[05:28.43]My thumb and my middle finger are together on both hands.
[05:33.50]They're both in the air.
[05:35.06]And I'm, okay, almost like I'm making like a kick the field goal here with my arms.
[05:40.50]And my hands are swaying back and forth.
[05:44.74]Wrist turn in towards head, wrist turns out towards the outside.
[05:51.04]One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two.
[05:59.37]Make the music louder?
[06:00.41]Why would I do that?
[06:04.41]I should be dropping it.
[06:06.43]But... I don't care.
[06:09.11]So we're gonna do this today.
[06:11.81]I'm... this is the last stream for a little while.
[06:16.82]For at least a couple days, probably three days.
[06:19.12]Because I have colonoscopy coming up here in a couple days.
[06:23.30]I'm kind of foodless at the moment.
[06:25.40]Like, I can't really eat that much.
[06:27.78]I can't eat anything tomorrow.
[06:29.34]I have to not eat for 24 hours before the procedure.
[06:32.26]And I can't really eat that much today.
[06:34.40]So, I might lose a little bit of energy here.
[06:38.09]And when that happens, I'm gonna have to leave.
[06:41.67]So, I'm gonna go as long as I can with, like, no real energy.
[06:46.25]What procedure?
[06:48.55]Colonoscopy.
[06:49.93]Colonoscopy.
[06:54.63]Yes, I can drink coffee.
[06:55.97]That is a thing.
[06:57.59]I can have chicken broth, coffee, jello.
[07:00.49]And I think I can have, like, just nothing really heavy.
[07:04.47]No high fats.
[07:06.47]I can't have anything with seeds in it.
[07:08.19]Or skin.
[07:09.69]No berries.
[07:10.95]No strawberries.
[07:11.91]No beans.
[07:12.81]Nothing like that.
[07:15.59]But we're just gonna go.
[07:18.31]So please excuse my low energy here.
[07:23.83]No, I'll be fine.
[07:25.47]I'm like, please excuse my low energy.
[07:30.39]It's like going into work and talking to your boss.
[07:33.81]Excuse my low energy today.
[07:35.93]I've got a colonoscopy in a couple days.
[07:39.75]No, it'll be good.
[07:44.23]But yeah.
[07:45.67]That's happening.
[07:46.18]This is the last stream for a few days.
[07:47.38]And then let's go.
[07:48.78]Let's just go.
[07:51.88]I decided to pick, I know you guys are looking at this going, hey, what the hell, how come you, what I wanted to pick.
[07:56.93]You should have let me pick.
[07:59.51]But I felt like going with Fortress.
[08:03.03]They looked pretty good.
[08:04.61]Gnoll, Lizardman, Serpentfly, Gorgons, Wyverns, Hydras.
[08:13.74]I like this.
[08:15.68]And of course I had to pick Void.
[08:21.00]Because Voy looks the most like Otto.
[08:25.70]This kind of looks like Otto in the morning when he puts his head under the blanket.
[08:29.50]This looks like Otto, too, when he has his head under the blanket at a different angle.
[08:41.79]All right, so we're going to start with Wyston.
[08:51.09]No, not this guy.
[08:53.25]You want me to be this guy?
[08:54.39]That's just like Vincent Van Gogh.
[08:59.19]What is he doing here?
[09:02.67]You have all these monsters and... Actually, well, there's another person here.
[09:06.53]But I mean, like, why is Vincent Van Gogh in the middle of, like, two autos?
[09:10.46]Like, dragons.
[09:11.82]It's the Burger King.
[09:12.74]It's not... Uh, now you've said the fucking Burger King.
[09:18.84]It's like Young Prince Burger King.
[09:29.60]It's Burger... It's a young... It's Prince Burger King.
[09:32.42]Alright, it's a Beastmaster.
[09:33.82]I don't know what that even means.
[09:38.06]Everybody else, who cares?
[09:38.96]This is on the map of Warlords.
[09:48.25]I have no idea how this is gonna play out.
[09:49.53]We're gonna stay in the same difficulty.
[09:50.77]We're not gonna... We'll do 130%.
[09:54.58]Just a little bit on the higher scale, but that's okay.
[09:58.27]The only way to lose is to lose everything.
[10:01.23]The only way to win is to kill everybody.
[10:08.12]Can you turn off taxes?
[10:10.54]I don't think this scenario does that.
[10:19.20]Battle Royale.
[10:20.12]Yeah, I think I'm ready to go.
[10:24.94]Are you ready?
[10:31.69]Wait!
[10:33.81]Lower the difficulty?
[10:34.49]No, it's okay.
[10:35.29]It's okay where it is.
[10:35.87]I just made some mistakes.
[10:37.95]One.
[10:39.65]Two.
[10:41.55]Three.
[10:47.53]Oh my god, this is gonna take forever.
[10:50.07]This is a huge fucking map.
[10:53.05]And there are eight- there are seven people here.
[10:55.35]I do have the corner, though.
[10:58.42]I'm in the best spot, I think.
[10:59.62]I really believe that.
[11:02.59]This is an 11-hour Simpsons stream incoming.
[11:05.09]No.
[11:05.73]Oh, fuck.
[11:09.22]Alright, what do I got?
[11:11.66]I got 15,000.
[11:12.66]Let's do this right.
[11:14.68]Look at this place.
[11:15.30]I've never seen this before.
[11:16.90]It's like a little swamp.
[11:20.38]Alright, Citadel.
[11:22.32]Town Hall.
[11:22.90]We want to get this immediately.
[11:26.28]So, Town Hall will give us 1,000 gold a day.
[11:31.56]We wanted it immediately.
[11:37.47]Prepare to backseat.
[11:38.85]Backseat gamers.
[11:40.99]Let's get these gnolls.
[11:44.41]And let's go out, let's get... I'm going to play this as to the book as possible.
[11:48.81]If there was an encyclopedia on how to play this game, I'm going to play it that way.
[11:56.71]I can't beat that guy.
[12:02.52]I'm just looking for a resource.
[12:05.62]Lots of sprites, you know.
[12:07.82]No resources right off the bat.
[12:13.29]There's a gate?
[12:16.11]Hold on, am I locked in my own kingdom?
[12:25.86]Garrison!
[12:27.04]It's a garrison!
[12:30.40]Are you serious?
[12:33.41]I can leave people here?
[12:35.98]This is unbelievably awesome.
[12:39.06]Wait, did I get a raid came in?
[12:41.64]Oh fuck, Jesus, I didn't even see it.
[12:43.44]RTGameCrowd came in with like a trillion people.
[12:50.28]Uh, thank you RTGameCrowd for the huge raid here.
[12:56.47]Welcome everybody.
[13:00.46]Hope you're having a good day.
[13:01.20]Hope your stream was good.
[13:02.58]What were you playing?
[13:03.84]What was RT playing?
[13:09.02]And did they complete the game?
[13:11.10]They're playing Nintendogs.
[13:12.18]How many dogs did he have?
[13:13.22]50 dogs.
[13:21.56]All of them.
[13:23.54]Well, I hope it was fun.
[13:25.22]Thank you so much for the raid.
[13:26.34]Welcome.
[13:26.70]A lot of you just came in.
[13:27.90]So, we're playing.
[13:28.61]This is Heroes of Might and Magic, and I'm going to win.
[13:32.07]I just started.
[13:33.13]You joined at a perfect fucking time.
[13:34.57]Let me tell you something.
[13:35.77]We got the Burger King Prince here.
[13:37.77]We got our gnolls here.
[13:41.05]I just started.
[13:41.83]I got a garrison here.
[13:44.01]What other things can I point out that are just obvious if you're looking at the screen?
[13:46.71]I got a moat here.
[13:48.27]Or a river.
[13:50.36]I've got a colon here.
[13:51.02]I've got a colonoscopy here in a couple days.
[13:52.78]That's what it's going to look like.
[13:54.56]Let's go.
[13:56.28]Thanks again.
[13:58.74]Every time a raid comes in, I've got to turn on the YouTuber voice.
[14:02.02]Hey guys, welcome!
[14:04.48]Witch's Hut.
[14:05.79]An ancient witch living in a strange hut welcomes you.
[14:08.57]Teaching you pathfinding for her own inscrutable purposes.
[14:13.19]That's actually really great.
[14:16.31]25% less rough terrain penalty.
[14:19.03]I'll take it.
[14:22.28]Of course you get a Link Dab.
[14:23.86]Yeah.
[14:24.08]Do you guys just have that in a tab?
[14:26.70]How many of you guys have that shit just in a tab, waiting for, like, a reason to use it?
[14:34.18]That's a... Why have that just ready to go in a tab?
[14:39.58]Lots of Gargoyles.
[14:40.36]I can't beat them with these.
[14:41.27]Alright, Swan Pond.
[14:42.65]I need to see what's in the Swan Pond.
[14:46.19]But, let's go back.
[14:47.43]We get gold a week here.
[14:51.13]Or every day.
[14:51.73]Alright, we got the Town Hall.
[14:55.67]Citadel, Marketplace.
[14:56.98]I want a City Hall.
[14:58.62]So we need Mage Guild, Marketplace and a Blacksmith.
[15:02.78]Of course we need the Blacksmith.
[15:05.62]So, let's get that built.
[15:08.85]We're gonna go as fast as we can to get that 4000 gold today.
[15:13.43]It's really important.
[15:14.41]If you don't know what I'm talking about,
[15:16.86]When you upgrade your city more than two or three times, you get the maximum amount of money.
[15:23.00]This is going to be the capital down here.
[15:25.82]You understand.
[15:26.32]Alright, Swan Pond.
[15:32.05]I got luck up.
[15:33.15]Alright, don't be an idiot here.
[15:35.49]I don't want to be like a fucking idiot here.
[15:38.79]Because that last time I spread the fuck out.
[15:41.33]Mercenary camp.
[15:42.98]What's wrong with me?
[15:46.03]I can only go that far?
[15:49.71]That's it?
[15:50.05]Alright, well, we need a marketplace.
[16:00.55]To get to, uh, marketplace.
[16:04.34]While we have the wood, we're gonna use it.
[16:05.82]Okay.
[16:11.80]So, should I go down, or should I go up?
[16:15.42]Remember, there are seven other people here.
[16:17.34]There are seven more fucking players.
[16:25.69]What are they?
[16:26.03]Down?
[16:26.69]Up?
[16:27.31]I'm gonna... The next thing that somebody writes, I'm gonna go.
[16:30.84]Down.
[16:31.18]Down.
[16:31.42]Okay.
[16:35.04]Another colonoscopy here.
[16:38.12]Log.
[16:38.82]Can I touch it?
[16:46.29]pack of Cerberi.
[16:48.20]I don't think I want to fuck with that.
[16:51.28]Finally, we get some treasure.
[16:57.44]I forget at the beginning of the game you can't move.
[16:58.94]You move so slowly.
[16:59.90]Alright, we can probably, now we can do, we need Mage Guild.
[17:03.70]And then we're going to do upgrade that hull.
[17:05.52]I wasn't doing this, remember last time I was like, let's make like a hundred gnolls.
[17:10.88]I'm going to have four heroes.
[17:17.90]Always go with experience first.
[17:21.62]Let's get that level up here.
[17:23.36]That treasure chest had advanced pathfinding and basic ballistics.
[17:27.70]So this is a Brewmaster?
[17:28.68]What do they do?
[17:29.58]What do they do?
[17:31.50]What do they do?
[17:34.11]Specialty is Ballista.
[17:35.47]It increases the attack and defense skill of any ballista for each level attained after fourth level.
[17:41.15]So I think we have to do ballistics.
[17:44.67]Basic Armor.
[17:46.63]Reduces all damage inflicted against the hero's troops by 5%.
[17:51.28]Basic artillery gives control of the ballista to the hero.
[17:53.74]That's pretty awesome.
[18:01.86]Wait, don't I already have this though?
[18:08.66]You know what I mean?
[18:09.08]I, like, already have this basic artillery, but, okay.
[18:12.48]But that's, okay.
[18:14.12]Yeah, let's do it.
[18:16.11]Oh, it's a catapult versus ballista.
[18:17.87]I get it.
[18:18.41]Alright.
[18:19.25]Nice.
[18:22.95]I have one for ballista, now I have one for catapult.
[18:24.81]I have one for... Yeah, they're different.
[18:28.30]What are we doing F for?
[18:28.96]What are we talking about?
[18:33.22]This is good shit.
[18:37.25]This is good shit!
[18:37.85]What are you talking about?
[18:38.53]Let's look up here.
[18:49.37]Alright, we've got a crossroads.
[18:52.21]We've got lots of dwarves, and then a war machine factory.
[18:55.31]I'm gonna... Well, this is just wrapping back the other way.
[18:57.69]Okay, let's go back to town.
[19:00.46]There's not a whole lot of resources back here.
[19:02.18]There's this.
[19:02.62]I've got to stock up enough.
[19:05.39]Let's get that, uh... Let's get the City Hall built.
[19:10.87]Now we got 2,000 gold a day.
[19:14.05]And I think we can do another hero now.
[19:18.78]I need a tavern for that, though.
[19:19.80]We'll do tavern next.
[19:27.38]I'm the king of the mud.
[19:30.76]War Machine Factory.
[19:33.42]Uh...
[19:34.84]There's no... none available!
[19:36.42]I can't just... I could get this right now!
[19:37.96]Is it first aid tent?
[19:40.36]I mean, I should just get them.
[19:44.41]But I already have it!
[19:46.31]Well, I'll get these then.
[19:51.03]Might as well just fill the party up.
[19:58.42]Yeah, okay.
[19:58.92]That's awesome.
[19:59.66]Nice.
[20:00.22]Sick.
[20:00.94]Fucking unbelievable.
[20:01.72]I'm doing so good.
[20:07.99]Tavern.
[20:08.43]Is there a tavern here?
[20:11.17]Oh, there is a tavern.
[20:11.81]Alright.
[20:12.21]Well, now I'm... Oh, that's another Beastmaster.
[20:15.45]I don't want to do Necromancer again.
[20:16.59]I did it last time, and it didn't... I'm gonna do Otto, waking up in the morning under the blankets.
[20:22.42]I don't want Thant again.
[20:25.14]Thant sucked.
[20:33.73]No, I'm doing Otto.
[20:38.37]What, if I don't hire him, he's gonna end up on the other team somewhere?
[20:42.55]What are the chances to get Phant again?
[20:46.31]Yeah, he sucks!
[20:47.85]Plus, he's gonna ruin my whole thing here.
[20:51.49]No, can I pay him a hundred bucks to, like, never come back?
[20:58.56]I'm going with, uh, I'm going with Otto.
[21:01.42]Resurrect is good.
[21:02.22]No, I don't want him.
[21:03.34]He was bad luck charm last time.
[21:09.10]My level 4 hero sucks at fighting level 17.
[21:11.16]No, he was like level 19.
[21:12.44]No.
[21:16.58]He's gone.
[21:21.08]No, he's not leaving.
[21:26.59]He's like, can I please come?
[21:28.61]I'll sit here as long as it takes.
[21:30.45]Alright, let's get you on a different path here.
[21:40.75]Two Beastmasters.
[21:41.41]Specialty Wyverns.
[21:42.85]Nice.
[21:43.71]Basic scouting.
[21:45.21]Easy to see.
[21:45.71]One extra square.
[21:48.15]Cool.
[21:48.55]Okay.
[21:54.92]I wonder if we can take on the sprites.
[22:00.48]Who's my other guy down here?
[22:01.34]Let's look here.
[22:02.14]Is it an observatory?
[22:05.02]Ooh.
[22:05.54]Now we can see.
[22:06.37]Hey.
[22:09.55]Hey.
[22:12.11]Are you already coming down here?
[22:17.23]How does this guy have this much?
[22:18.47]It's the first... It's the first week!
[22:21.69]I thought possible!
[22:32.24]Lizard Den.
[22:33.24]I gotta build some of these.
[22:35.74]He went all in on troops.
[22:37.42]What is this?
[22:37.76]Glyph of Fear.
[22:39.90]Alright, I'm gonna get the Lizard Den out.
[22:48.85]Let's get some lizards.
[22:53.15]Man, you come on out.
[22:56.03]Actually, no, you know what?
[22:56.73]You can stay there.
[22:57.85]He's not going to come over here.
[22:59.09]That's, like, rough terrain.
[23:04.28]This is lots of dwarves.
[23:06.08]What is this?
[23:06.40]This is like a lumber mill.
[23:10.84]Water wheel.
[23:11.48]500 gold.
[23:12.72]That's not that good.
[23:17.94]Alright, let's go the next week and see what happens.
[23:24.23]He's fucking coming down here.
[23:26.97]Why is everybody coming down here?
[23:32.00]Pack, pack, pack, few, several.
[23:37.38]He's already here.
[23:39.60]They're already encroaching on my swamp.
[23:47.54]All right, Serpentfly, Basilisk Pit.
[23:50.66]So, I need... I need... What do I need?
[23:52.66]A couple of wood?
[23:58.60]All right, this is Marketplace.
[23:59.40]I need... I need... I need some wood.
[24:02.56]Let's go... I have lots of ore.
[24:05.65]What do I need?
[24:07.05]Three?
[24:09.35]No, no.
[24:09.65]Ten to one.
[24:10.67]Come on.
[24:12.73]Oh, this is bad.
[24:21.58]Well, I got 16, 14.
[24:23.96]I could go up here.
[24:25.48]And maybe make a trade here.
[24:27.40]I gotta go up into the garrison.
[24:31.25]Because I don't have any more troops.
[24:33.01]I can't even buy them.
[24:38.13]Lots of sprites.
[24:38.95]I wonder if I can just kill this and take this all.
[24:40.47]There's so much wood over here.
[24:43.99]I'm gonna try it.
[24:44.49]Alright.
[24:49.57]I can do this.
[25:00.18]Oh, this is actually... Sprites are, like, the easiest things.
[25:03.42]I didn't know they were that weak.
[25:06.01]Well, I say that.
[25:08.93]Alright, we'll get this wood, and I'll be able to get some more troops.
[25:20.20]Alright.
[25:21.14]Good.
[25:22.02]I lost some gnolls, but it's okay.
[25:24.26]Oh my god, there's so much over here.
[25:27.62]Claim this.
[25:28.92]Ah, I'm so far away.
[25:29.96]I can't... Look at all this stuff.
[25:32.62]He's gonna come down here and he's gonna kill me.
[25:35.30]Isn't he?
[25:38.21]I've got to go down.
[25:42.51]I'm gonna wrap around this way.
[25:45.35]Damn.
[25:46.57]I only have 24 gnolls.
[25:49.65]I'm gonna hit the mercenary camp and I'm probably gonna die.
[25:53.19]The sneak king is gonna die like today.
[25:55.64]I hope you guys are aware of this.
[26:00.27]It's a new week coming up.
[26:07.79]Citadel Captain's Quarters.
[26:10.19]That's good.
[26:13.39]How much are Captain's Quarters?
[26:14.49]It's just money.
[26:17.73]We can do Citadel.
[26:21.29]Citadel is growth for everybody.
[26:28.21]Okay, let's just hope he doesn't do anything.
[26:30.22]He's gonna- we're gonna fight and I'm gonna die.
[26:32.06]Say goodbye to the Sneak King.
[26:33.98]No, he's just- Already has all this shit.
[26:45.47]I think I just lost.
[26:49.27]So it turns out being down in the swamp was not good.
[26:53.95]Um, I- not yet.
[26:57.17]What is the biggest threat here?
[27:00.07]13th, 10th... He doesn't have... No, I'm... I lose.
[27:06.59]He actually bought units.
[27:07.75]Well, because last time when I did that, it snowballed me into not being able to do anything.
[27:14.48]I tried to, like, upgrade the capital first, because I figured with a huge map, I wasn't going to get attacked in the first month.
[27:25.20]It's not over yet.
[27:32.61]Health 10, health 20.
[27:37.58]That's definitely wrong.
[27:47.29]I wish I had anything.
[27:52.73]End of the- end of the mudshire!
[28:01.94]I mean, hold on.
[28:02.82]Hold on, though.
[28:03.80]It's not over yet.
[28:16.09]Come on!
[28:18.59]It's not over yet.
[28:19.77]It's not over yet.
[28:21.46]No.
[28:23.58]Holy shit, I might actually win.
[28:24.84]No, I won't.
[28:30.51]No, there's like too many.
[28:36.67]I forgot about this guy.
[28:42.41]Well, I tried just making a bunch of monsters last time, and nobody attacked me for six months.
[28:49.48]And then I went, let me try to get like money first.
[28:51.72]Let me like tech first.
[28:52.78]No, I'm attacked in the first like two weeks.
[28:57.71]He's gonna take all this stuff.
[28:59.38]Oh my fucking god.
[29:05.66]He didn't get it all.
[29:12.26]Hold on a second.
[29:14.58]I might be able to get revenge here.
[29:18.28]Where the hell am I going?
[29:25.43]I can't afford it.
[29:32.55]Buy a hero, yeah.
[29:33.55]Buy a hero, stack with units, then send out.
[29:36.01]That's what I did last time.
[29:38.19]It's not over yet.
[29:39.27]No, it's not over yet.
[29:40.07]Not yet.
[29:46.01]Witch or Cleric?
[29:54.66]Probably Witch.
[29:59.04]I can get my revenge here.
[30:04.68]Okay.
[30:05.34]It's not over.
[30:08.62]35, 13, 4.
[30:14.53]I got him up here.
[30:15.49]He's got 24.
[30:15.83]There's nobody in this garrison.
[30:22.29]He's gonna get this materials up down here.
[30:28.27]Yeah, I made it.
[30:28.93]Okay.
[30:29.95]Now the question is, can I get far enough?
[30:33.64]Where I can meet you up here.
[30:37.28]Oh, am I one fucking pixel away?
[30:41.42]Come on.
[30:47.78]I can do it.
[30:49.96]No!
[30:55.42]Attack him?
[30:56.06]No, I can't.
[30:56.98]Not yet.
[30:58.14]I want those gnolls.
[31:02.87]He took everything.
[31:03.59]Oh, that was a bad fucking start.
[31:09.04]Cause he still has the... Alright, fucking get rid of him.
[31:26.11]Yeah, cause he still has this shit.
[31:29.33]Like, these guys, he has like more than I do.
[31:33.08]Alright, it's time to win.
[31:37.28]Magic arrow, we're gonna deal with you.
[31:42.79]Uh, fly over here.
[31:53.63]He took all that stuff.
[31:54.69]Like, what are you even doing down here?
[31:56.08]This is like, this map is huge!
[32:01.12]Last night, we didn't see a monster.
[32:04.66]We didn't see another person for two to three straight months.
[32:09.87]Fucking bullshit.
[32:10.85]What's going on?
[32:11.43]Why am I... Oh, what?
[32:14.83]Okay, I can control them because of the... I get it, right.
[32:17.65]I kind of have to go back.
[32:30.77]It's because it was water.
[32:31.99]Alright, that makes sense.
[32:34.41]I can't shoot anybody, just keep moving.
[32:44.33]You really don't like that tent, do you?
[32:55.07]Bug on bug action.
[32:57.13]Is that an oof?
[33:12.40]Alright.
[33:13.44]Nulls are going to be so heavy this game.
[33:15.91]It's not over yet.
[33:18.51]I just got kind of, like, fucked over in the beginning.
[33:20.49]It's okay.
[33:20.81]Don't worry.
[33:21.11]We're going to be fine.
[33:33.78]I'll get really good experience with doing this.
[33:54.23]Did he go twice?
[34:00.76]All the experience he just stole from me, I'm about to get it right back.
[34:13.91]Don't let him run, I'm trying to get the gnoll up there.
[34:17.91]There you go, he's dead.
[34:24.05]No running for you, 900 experience.
[34:29.39]Alright.
[34:30.17]Now I get the wood.
[34:31.43]And I get the learning stone.
[34:33.34]Okay.
[34:36.60]I... God damn it!
[34:37.64]I can't believe he came in immediately and just took all my shit.
[34:40.64]I'm so irritated about that.
[34:42.24]Allows your hero to learn 4th level spells or eagle eye.
[34:54.90]I'm so fucking, like, irritated.
[34:57.57]I wonder if it should be... Probably wisdom.
[35:04.57]Give me this back.
[35:05.67]One of you take it.
[35:06.27]Alright, now everything's okay again.
[35:09.46]There is another person that's over here.
[35:13.44]There is... Okay, what do you got?
[35:15.10]You got lots of skeleton warriors.
[35:17.74]There's a lot of stuff up there.
[35:19.52]It's blue.
[35:22.41]What do you got?
[35:23.63]Oh, you got nothing.
[35:25.86]See, like, why could I be over here where he is?
[35:28.26]He's got a pack of, like, rats, and that's it.
[35:32.26]Of course, the one dickhead that stacked minions, like, ran straight down.
[35:35.84]Alright, uh, let's go back to the castle.
[35:45.39]I got the Zerg, yeah, okay.
[35:48.76]Uh, Glyphs of Fear, Captain's Quarters.
[35:50.96]Might as well just make it.
[35:52.52]Just because.
[35:54.12]Get those extra gnolls.
[35:58.28]And then next week I'm going to get the Fly Den.
[36:00.55]What does it cost?
[36:04.83]Serpent Fly.
[36:05.49]I need five wood.
[36:06.49]I have the rest.
[36:11.53]I gotta work on wood.
[36:13.83]Alright, you don't have anybody.
[36:15.76]You gotta go back here.
[36:16.64]And we're gonna claim this, too.
[36:18.50]Lots of halberds.
[36:19.30]They're hard, though.
[36:25.02]Where are you right now?
[36:28.68]See, like, he has, like, a, like, pack.
[36:30.76]Several.
[36:31.66]Where's he going?
[36:32.14]Down the sanctuary?
[36:32.92]Okay, well, that's all done.
[36:36.68]I got that claimed.
[36:38.40]You go in here.
[36:44.70]Okay, I can't do any of this.
[36:46.12]I need that wood.
[36:46.84]I only get, what, one a day?
[36:50.02]Two a day?
[36:52.44]Don't have enough to do anything.
[37:00.31]We have 50 and 12.
[37:02.69]I think I can go out with her.
[37:03.79]50 gnolls is a lot of gnolls.
[37:06.27]I should be okay.
[37:07.51]In fact, I wonder if the gnolls can take on the halberds.
[37:27.79]Holy shit.
[37:28.43]This nine... That was nine wood.
[37:30.01]He missed it.
[37:31.01]I thought he got everything.
[37:32.06]Oh, wow.
[37:34.06]Thank heavens.
[37:35.70]Serpent fly hive.
[37:37.42]And I should do the gnoll hut.
[37:38.46]Upgrade the gnoll hut and get super gnolls.
[37:40.48]No.
[37:40.66]What do I do?
[37:41.54]Super... No.
[37:46.46]I think I'm just going straight up extra super gnolls.
[37:50.82]And then I'm going to transfer them into super gnolls and then go up.
[37:58.90]All right, come back here.
[38:13.00]Oh my goodness, everybody's like all over the place now.
[38:15.96]I want these 50 gnolls to be super gnolls.
[38:19.03]Out of the way.
[38:26.31]Bingo.
[38:27.59]No Marauders.
[38:28.33]What's the difference to you?
[38:31.27]3, 5.
[38:31.31]2 to 3, 6.
[38:32.39]2 to 3, 6, 5.
[38:34.01]2 to 3, 6, 4.
[38:34.77]They're higher defense, higher attack skill.
[38:38.88]Yeah, they're just better.
[38:45.90]Now... Better Lizards?
[38:49.60]What do you think?
[38:50.06]Should I just go straight up Better Lizards?
[38:54.53]I wonder if I should do that right now.
[38:56.65]Yep.
[39:03.27]This is good now.
[39:03.85]This is really good.
[39:06.91]Lizard warriors, lizard men.
[39:09.73]Two to three.
[39:10.89]Okay, hold on.
[39:11.66]Five, six.
[39:12.84]We do 12 shots.
[39:14.20]Six, eight, 24.
[39:14.80]Two to five, 15, 14.
[39:17.12]Better speed.
[39:19.06]All right.
[39:20.44]Looking good so far.
[39:25.82]I think it's time to just, I'm gonna, I think I can take these, uh, halberdiers.
[39:34.50]Maybe I should wait till next week and get fully upgraded.
[39:38.88]Because you're, he's just not doing shit in here, is he?
[39:47.55]I'm thinking of just waiting till next week, get a good pack, and then bring it up.
[40:00.41]The plan doesn't change here.
[40:01.79]You know what I mean?
[40:04.43]I don't think I should change the plan.
[40:08.07]So, capital needs castle.
[40:10.08]So I need 10 wood.
[40:12.08]I need serpents.
[40:13.38]So I need 5 wood before the end of this week.
[40:20.56]Alright, do you think... Should I go after the halberdas?
[40:23.32]With my 50 gnolls and 12 lizard warriors.
[40:30.12]WAIT!
[40:34.82]Just in case something fucking really bad happens.
[40:37.62]That just scared the shit out of me.
[40:49.71]Conquerors.
[40:54.07]I got this.
[40:54.57]It's gonna take me forever to get here.
[41:04.06]Let's do... Haste.
[41:06.70]Bloodlust.
[41:07.32]Bloodlust on, uh... I think I'm gonna pick Bloodlust on you.
[41:13.84]Bang.
[41:15.10]Nice.
[41:15.40]I don't want... Nobody die.
[41:25.37]Nobody die.
[41:25.83]Three dead.
[41:27.83]You gotta go twice?
[41:28.55]Alright.
[41:29.07]Yes!
[41:34.03]And I get this right here, too.
[41:35.37]Oh, I'm so fucking happy.
[41:37.49]Knowledge plus one, level three.
[41:39.05]Advance first aid.
[41:40.43]Gives control of the first aid tent to the hero, healing 75 points of damage to the first unit of the selected stack.
[41:46.67]Or basic water magic.
[41:54.99]75 points of damage.
[41:57.65]I feel like I want the water.
[41:59.83]But, 75 health is a lot.
[42:06.91]Look at all this.
[42:08.63]Nine ore.
[42:09.97]Five ore.
[42:11.03]Five ore.
[42:11.61]There's so much over here.
[42:14.29]This is beautiful.
[42:15.91]Alright, I got another couple days before... I need, uh... Let's go in here.
[42:23.21]I need... What the fuck do I need?
[42:26.92]Five wood.
[42:27.58]What do I have now?
[42:28.14]Two?
[42:29.10]Got a couple days left.
[42:38.59]Alright, let's grab that.
[42:39.87]Six.
[42:41.31]Claim this.
[42:41.95]I couldn't touch it.
[42:44.20]All that wood gone, but it did help a lot.
[42:45.62]Okay, so now I've got two a day over here, and it's all the way down in my swamp.
[42:50.52]Seems pretty good.
[42:53.00]Alright, we're almost there.
[42:53.78]I need one more wood, which I can get it tomorrow.
[42:57.96]That will bring me to serpents.
[43:06.45]Oh!
[43:06.53]Oh!
[43:08.11]I should get this.
[43:10.57]One wooden one ore a day.
[43:18.62]That's amazing.
[43:22.12]Cage of Warlords.
[43:26.04]Shipyard.
[43:27.02]I can buy boats from here.
[43:30.29]Alright, let's get that Surf and Fly Hive next.
[43:32.81]And then I'll have a good army and I'm going to go take them up.
[43:36.12]One of my thoughts on the game so far?
[43:37.21]This game is phenomenal.
[43:38.31]It's absolutely fantastic.
[43:43.83]Okay, so let's bring you back.
[43:45.25]It's almost time for a new week.
[43:52.36]Motherfucker.
[44:00.70]Flyhive.
[44:03.91]Get it.
[44:05.39]I am now available.
[44:07.21]Hold on.
[44:08.93]What about tomorrow?
[44:11.63]Growth is incoming tomorrow.
[44:13.83]Fly hive.
[44:14.59]I can't do it.
[44:15.33]I can do it tomorrow.
[44:17.57]I can do super flies tomorrow.
[44:24.13]Next.
[44:24.47]It's first week.
[44:25.95]Second week.
[44:26.49]Here we go.
[44:27.27]Super flies.
[44:28.39]Get it all.
[44:29.21]I'm going for it.
[44:30.07]Watch this.
[44:33.72]And then this hero's going out.
[44:39.31]You leave for a moment.
[44:40.15]Do I have to back up?
[44:45.63]Can we not both fit on the road?
[44:53.80]Oh, this is gonna be awesome.
[44:54.68]Alright, here we go.
[44:55.18]Ready?
[44:56.46]I am ready to take a large army up.
[45:02.58]Upgrade the... or should I get basilisks right now?

[47:30.12]Alright, I'm going up.
[47:30.84]I'm going up.
[47:31.27]I'm going up.
[47:31.65]I'm going up.
[47:32.83]I have a lot.
[47:34.23]I can get rid of orange right now.
[47:36.85]I'm going in here.
[47:44.85]He's blocking the gate.
[47:46.53]He's gonna die, but it's okay.
[47:47.93]Look at this crew.
[47:49.07]This is a really good first month, second month crew.
[47:54.25]He's scared.
[47:54.73]He ain't fucking gonna handle this.
[47:56.17]I'm gonna kill him.
[47:56.95]He's dead.
[48:02.25]Let's start clearing shit.
[48:06.65]You can take the next stack of people.
[48:19.59]Where am I?
[48:20.19]Oh, right here.
[48:23.65]Alright, we're going this way.
[48:24.77]I've got a lot of good troops.
[48:27.53]I'm going to head out towards the witch's hut here.
[48:31.28]I got basic pathfinding good.
[48:33.76]Mercenary camp.
[48:35.66]Plus one attack.
[48:38.22]You're in big trouble.
[48:41.94]And then I'm going to claim this.
[48:44.00]We'll get through this.
[48:47.36]And I'm going to go down.
[48:48.14]I'm going to grab this.
[48:49.96]There's a harpy loft over there.
[48:51.06]I got a plan.
[48:54.43]I think it's a decent plan.
[48:57.84]Let me get the basilisk thing opened and upgraded.
[49:00.97]Basilisk pit.
[49:01.93]Make it.
[49:03.23]There it is.
[49:04.39]Four basilisks are available.
[49:07.87]We let them hang out.
[49:08.51]We don't have to do anything about this.
[49:10.09]This is your team.
[49:16.23]Now you die.
[49:21.61]What about the dwarves?
[49:24.21]What is it?
[49:24.69]Lots of dwarves?
[49:26.37]I can handle it.
[49:28.23]I want this silver pit.
[49:36.94]Oh, yes!
[49:39.94]Sometimes you just have to go for it because they don't want to fight you.
[49:43.82]35 fucking dwarves.
[49:46.08]Now you actually are dead.
[49:50.02]You can't be scared.
[49:51.30]Sometimes you just gotta go for it.
[49:54.88]He ain't gonna get out of here.
[49:56.90]Head in here.
[49:58.18]Let's get you in the building.
[50:01.80]Get you some troops, just in case something bad happens.
[50:03.82]We got four baskets on, you know.
[50:06.93]What else can I buy here?
[50:08.19]Nothing.
[50:08.45]We got no money.
[50:10.53]Here we go.
[50:13.25]Really?
[50:14.83]Really.
[50:18.17]Time to die.
[50:20.51]In fact, I can just bring the Serpents straight in and just murder you.
[50:28.91]Let's go Bloodlust on the Serpents.
[50:34.61]The Serpents are going right for the Jesters.
[50:36.73]Oh, you're just infecting everybody.
[50:48.72]I love it.
[50:51.71]Okay, let's move.
[50:53.35]You gotta start moving down here.
[50:58.04]And I wonder who's more of a priority.
[50:59.70]Probably the gargoyles.
[51:00.98]Because they can move really fast.
[51:07.18]Get those dwarves up there.
[51:15.34]Alright, gargoyles.
[51:18.78]Dead?
[51:25.37]Let's go for the golems.
[51:26.55]They're the most dangerous.
[51:29.21]Fine, bring it up to the nose.
[51:30.23]That was a mistake.
[51:32.11]You shouldn't have done that.
[51:35.46]He's gone.
[51:36.62]I didn't lose very much, and I got a bunch of experience.
[51:39.78]And he's out of here.
[51:40.40]Let's claim this all.
[51:47.67]Back to the building.
[51:49.55]How we doing?
[51:53.47]Okay, got more.
[51:54.21]Let me see what I want to build.
[51:56.49]Glyphs of Fear.
[51:58.69]Plus two to a Garrison's Hero Defense when defending.
[52:01.75]Can upgrade the pit next.
[52:02.96]I just need money.
[52:04.34]We're going to get the glyph.
[52:06.26]Just to get it.
[52:06.76]Alright, here comes somebody else.
[52:22.04]Who is that?
[52:23.06]That is blue.
[52:25.08]Several pack few, you're dead.
[52:27.14]Oh, this feels good to be powerful.
[52:28.92]It feels good to have, like, power.
[52:31.93]Lots of stone golems.
[52:32.91]I mean, we're gonna meet you halfway here.
[52:34.81]You're in trouble.
[52:40.27]Get out of my territory.
[52:42.13]Told you it wasn't over.
[52:43.89]No, it's not over.
[52:46.39]Restart, restart.
[52:47.21]No, no.
[52:47.57]You gotta push through sometimes.
[52:51.11]Blood Obelisk.
[52:53.61]Cage of Warlords.
[52:56.33]Upgrade Basilisk Pit.
[53:01.00]Now we have greater basilisks.
[53:03.76]6 to 10, 25.
[53:07.68]6 to 10, 40.
[53:09.08]And they're faster.
[53:17.49]Now the pit has eyes.
[53:18.77]Yeah, that's fucking weird.
[53:22.08]Okay.
[53:23.78]Continue.
[53:25.52]Where are you going?
[53:26.50]You're going all the way down here.
[53:31.15]What are you doing, man?
[53:35.19]Are you just like... You're just asking to die.
[53:40.27]All dwellings increase population.
[53:41.62]I don't think I even need... I don't think I even have to go down there.
[53:45.46]Mm-mm.
[53:49.20]Mm-mm.
[53:51.55]I'm coming out.
[53:52.99]Because guess what?
[53:57.63]I got nine basilisks and two... He's not going to take this.
[54:07.18]Maybe I should just follow him down here.
[54:09.08]Yeah, let's... I'm... No, you're not taking this all from me.
[54:15.39]Well, now you trapped yourself.
[54:23.09]But I'll take it back.
[54:26.29]And I'm gonna block the road.
[54:29.43]Good luck.
[54:33.48]Pink is dead.
[54:34.88]Pink has been vanquished.
[54:41.56]There are seven who remain.
[54:49.01]Same deal.
[54:52.11]Bloodlust on... Bloodlust on the Archers.
[54:57.68]And then we got here... Anybody... I don't think Hayden has any ranged.
[55:00.28]I think I should probably go for the Wolf Riders.
[55:13.75]Now Bloodlust is melee.
[55:14.99]Fuck.
[55:18.34]It's only melee.
[55:19.16]Damn it.
[55:22.21]Alright, I'm going in for Wolf Riders.
[55:26.37]I'm gonna feel like killing him in one hit.
[55:28.38]Yeah.
[55:28.84]You know, you just didn't stand a chance.
[55:36.78]I mean, you just, you don't stand any chance.
[55:38.66]Why would you throw it at him?
[55:52.43]Yeah, you're more of an immediate threat.
[55:57.53]Enemy ran away.
[56:00.65]Out of my territory.
[56:01.95]And look where we are.
[56:02.79]We're down here, and I can go down here, and I can stalk up again.
[56:05.98]I'm gonna be fucking pretty damn unstoppable.
[56:12.44]Look at this.
[56:12.84]Mm-hmm.
[56:24.99]pull him out.
[56:25.82]Actually, I can just trade them.
[56:33.16]Hey, come here.
[56:35.48]You can have 13 more of these, 12 more of these, 33 more of these, and actually, I'll give you one dwarf.
[56:42.25]How does that sound?
[56:51.27]Alright, back in here.
[56:52.98]You and the one dwarf.
[56:57.03]Now that's an armor.
[57:03.00]Oh yeah, give me the other stuff too.
[57:04.94]I'm just gonna strip you.
[57:09.70]Give me this shit.
[57:12.14]Give me this.
[57:13.66]Give me this.
[57:14.22]I already have one of those.
[57:15.20]Give me artifacts.
[57:29.04]Get back in here.
[57:30.48]Good.
[57:32.08]Now, it's time to go up.
[57:36.23]And I now have basilisks.
[57:37.39]I'm good to go.
[57:38.03]This is a huge army.
[57:40.55]Now I get to go wherever I please.
[57:41.71]I'm already got this claimed.
[57:44.73]I'm going to go right.
[57:46.01]Nobody is over here.
[57:46.83]Now I'm going to go down.
[57:47.91]I'm going to go down and go up.
[57:49.42]Let's get rid of these gargoyles.
[57:51.94]Move on from here.
[58:03.72]Don't pursue.
[58:05.08]Let him run.
[58:12.00]Got the sulfur.
[58:14.58]Plus two luck.
[58:16.12]From the pond.
[58:18.30]A pack of Cerberi.
[58:19.42]Now that might not be something I want to do.
[58:21.52]I wonder if it's something I should try.
[58:40.03]Down engage.
[58:42.51]Now this is a harpy loft.
[58:45.93]Yep.
[58:48.95]Just have more units.
[58:50.87]It's time to begin... CONQUERING!
[58:54.13]Wait, let's go back to the castle.
[58:59.78]Let's get some more of these units.
[59:01.30]Just in case something fucking bad happens.
[59:04.68]Blood Obelisk, Cage of Warlords, Wyvern Nest, Gorgon Lair.
[59:08.78]Let's do Gorgon Lair.
[59:14.54]We'll get the growth, the double growth from Gorgons.
[59:20.14]And remember, we're just, we're stashing here with this guy.
[59:23.81]Until I get another castle, I am stashing.
[59:27.89]New week.
[59:30.77]All populations have doubled.
[59:33.53]Now you're over here.
[59:35.39]What are you looking at?
[59:36.58]There's a blue over here somewhere.
[59:40.22]Where's that blue guy?
[59:41.16]Right here?
[59:41.46]Okay, you're over here.
[59:42.40]What do you got?
[59:44.34]Pack.
[59:45.42]View.
[59:45.86]Lots.
[59:46.38]Board.
[59:46.84]Lots.
[59:48.12]Pretty dangerous.
[59:50.20]But I'll be okay.
[59:52.72]Let's head up this way.
[59:54.18]Make sure to go down.
[59:55.72]Let's go through the stone golems.
[60:00.09]Don't pursue them.
[60:00.65]Let them run.
[60:02.05]Cliff nest?
[60:05.83]The cliff nest is guarded by several rocks.
[60:07.95]Do you wish to fight the guards?
[60:09.81]Rocks.
[60:11.99]Am I going to get griffins?
[60:16.59]Alright, this is... Alright, hold on here.
[60:21.35]Um... Magic Arrow?
[60:24.37]Haste?
[60:27.89]Bloodlust on... Bloodlust on the Dragonflies?
[60:37.43]Just get him in?
[60:40.53]Or Haste on the Dragonflies?
[60:43.71]Wait for him to come to you.
[60:44.61]I think he can make it across the whole thing, can he?
[60:48.75]Or haste on the archers.
[60:49.67]That's not a bad idea.
[60:53.33]Haste on archers.
[60:54.25]So maybe I should just wait.
[61:05.42]Because I think he can fly all the way across.
[61:07.02]Yeah, I'll wait.
[61:15.01]Oof.
[61:19.85]I'm gonna put the Basilisks... They have 60 health each.
[61:28.24]I'm putting Basilisk in front of Archers.
[61:39.69]Block Archers.
[61:40.59]Get the Dwarves in front of the Archers!
[61:43.60]Just make a giant... No, no, no, don't do that much.
[61:47.38]Should I just put every hex?
[61:49.46]Here we go, look at this.
[61:52.42]Here he comes!
[61:54.63]Alright, he still has to come to us.
[61:59.87]Haste the archers again.
[62:01.59]But bloodlust... I'm bloodlust on the gargoyles.
[62:06.59]And I'm going in.
[62:09.90]Wait, don't haste the archers.
[62:12.34]Increase the speed of the selected unit.
[62:14.40]People were telling me that was a good idea.
[62:15.74]That's not a good idea?
[62:17.12]Haste is just movement.
[62:18.28]Oh, was I getting baited?
[62:19.82]Everyone was like, haste the archers, haste the archers.
[62:23.01]Speed is just movement.
[62:23.83]I thought maybe it was turns as well.
[62:28.69]I'm going to Bloodlust on the Basilisk.
[62:37.87]And we're going in.
[62:40.31]get in there over the gnolls basilisk bloodlust bang he's only got one more one more hit nice I lost it a little bit but not that was that was okay here we go expert first aid
[63:10.67]100 points of damage to the first unit of the selected stack.
[63:15.69]Or should I get earth magic?
[63:18.77]Yeah, first aid, unless you have, here's how first aid is good.
[63:21.74]Because remember, it's to the first unit of the stack.
[63:26.48]So if you have, let's say for instance like a dragon or something, something that has more than 100 health.
[63:34.52]You know, if a dragon has 150 health, then, right, you just do that.
[63:38.34]But I don't have anything like that yet.
[63:40.00]Let's do Earth Magic.
[63:46.72]This is a pretty stacked party right now.
[63:53.32]It just is.
[63:54.24]So, I mean, I could meet you here.
[64:00.32]This would be a fight, but he wouldn't take the castle.
[64:03.12]I'd probably win.
[64:07.74]Where do I go down?
[64:08.46]I used all that money.
[64:15.51]I don't have any more money to do this.
[64:17.37]I can't really do it yet.
[64:25.66]I wonder... I don't know if he's gonna come down.
[64:29.02]Okay, if he comes down here, then I start to change my strategy.
[64:40.05]Because I don't think he even knows this exists down here.
[64:47.47]Should I pull back and go on defense?
[64:50.60]Well, we'll have to find out.
[64:51.50]We'll see what he does this week.
[64:54.14]There he goes.
[64:54.58]Okay.
[64:55.02]He's not coming down here.
[64:56.64]Up or down?
[64:57.08]I'm going to say down.
[65:09.15]Nothing in here.
[65:11.94]Okay, let's take it slow here.
[65:14.36]Ooh, how do I get in there?
[65:24.21]I think I can get in there from here.
[65:32.41]Look at this down here.
[65:33.15]There's like a little slot down there.
[65:34.55]Go back.
[65:40.98]Let's check on... I'm just gonna... I'm building, you know.
[65:43.26]I'm just gonna build.
[65:44.10]Upgrade the Gorgon Lair.
[65:47.20]And then now look at this.
[65:48.68]I can get upgraded Gorgons.
[65:49.81]What do they turn into?
[65:50.51]Are they throwing up?
[65:56.11]Why is he puking?
[65:57.61]Why is he just throwing up?
[65:58.87]10, 14, 12 to 16.
[66:01.43]12 toberger to 16.
[66:02.03]Same damage.
[66:02.35]Same health.
[66:08.97]But higher defense and a little bit faster.
[66:11.85]Can move further.
[66:18.70]When I get the money... I felt like somebody was just going to just drive into the house.
[66:26.10]Like, I really felt like somebody was going into the window.
[66:28.14]Like, I thought that was somebody in a little drone flying and crashing into my window.
[66:32.46]That just scared the shit out of me.
[66:36.32]That was in the house, yeah.
[66:39.94]That's not fake.
[66:41.38]If somebody's in a pod racer out here.
[66:43.40]That was a Star Wars fucking pod racer.
[66:47.25]That wasn't even a car.
[66:50.85]Yeah, it really was.
[66:51.69]Just waiting for the guy to yell outside his fucking car.
[66:56.25]Oh no!
[67:19.01]All right, stick to the plan.
[67:21.35]I'm going back this way.
[67:28.04]I need to get... There's so much treasure under there.
[67:29.70]I'm taking a risk and see if it pays off.
[67:31.88]Any more of these?
[67:32.56]Let's check.
[67:34.36]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[67:35.40]Let me just get this.
[67:36.27]Are there any more in here?
[67:38.93]No, I didn't know if it may be this... I don't know.
[67:41.03]Go down.
[67:42.81]Come on.
[67:44.61]Come on!
[67:46.18]Make this worth it.
[67:47.40]Make it worth it.
[67:48.20]The hat, it's gotta be like a little path down here.
[67:50.08]Make it worth it, please.
[67:51.56]There is, but there's like fucking magma elementals.
[67:54.32]I don't think I can go through here.
[67:55.91]Should I do this?
[67:56.49]There's a lot of treasure over here.
[68:01.05]Somebody's coming!
[68:10.92]Pack, lots, few, several, several.
[68:13.58]This'll be a fight.
[68:17.11]But what if they're... But what if they want to join us?
[68:40.76]Okay, but what do I do?
[68:43.89]I have too many people.
[68:47.39]Harpies?
[68:48.81]Harpies are out of here.
[68:50.49]Trade Harpies for Magma Elementals.
[68:58.73]I spent like a thousand bucks on these though.
[69:10.76]Six to ten.
[69:11.48]Holy fuck.
[69:12.40]Oh yeah.
[69:13.54]What about the Dwarves?
[69:14.28]The Dwarves are kind of terrible though.
[69:16.72]They haven't done anything.
[69:17.40]They just stood around.
[69:18.10]They just watched the fights.
[69:19.92]6... So 7 and 8.
[69:21.42]6 and 5.
[69:22.92]Now they're better.
[69:26.16]Yeah, there's a lot of them.
[69:28.04]Yeah.
[69:28.36]Okay, that's it.
[69:30.46]That's... Holy shit, man.
[69:31.74]Sometimes you gotta go for it.
[69:35.40]And now I got a ton of stuff down here.
[69:37.34]500 gold.
[69:39.84]I'm thinking I buy... I'm... I'm thinking to take the money.
[69:43.40]Because then I can buy every unit.
[69:46.23]Someone's coming down here.
[69:50.93]Always experience?
[69:52.55]Yeah!
[69:55.11]Level 5, Expert Wisdom Basic Navigation.
[69:58.04]Crystal Hero's movement points at C by 50%.
[70:01.44]Or... 5th level spells.
[70:04.30]But I don't have a Mage Tower!
[70:10.30]And then we get to go this way.
[70:11.82]Look at this little fucking secret.
[70:15.21]I'm gonna head back here.
[70:17.17]Upgrade these guys.
[70:19.56]How much can I pull out?
[70:23.10]A pretty substantial amount of people.
[70:24.52]There's still one dwarf here.
[70:31.08]I mean, this is a decent army.
[70:37.03]What the hell is that?
[70:40.71]I tried to click it!
[70:41.43]He's taking my shit.
[70:47.51]Dragon Wing Tavern?
[70:52.93]This item increases your knowledge and power skills by plus two.
[70:57.31]This guy scares me.
[70:58.11]He's coming.
[70:58.51]He's wrapping around.
[71:01.63]It might be time to... But I want to go over here and see.
[71:04.29]I want to get all this stuff.
[71:05.76]Look at all this stuff.
[71:11.16]I can go back and just stack and have so many...
[71:15.65]But he's going to come down here and take all this stuff.
[71:22.29]The stuff's not going to go anywhere.
[71:24.19]But... Fuck.
[71:28.92]I have to go all the way around.
[71:32.30]He's going to get there before I do.
[71:38.28]Lots of griffins blocking the way here.
[71:44.03]I'm going for greed.
[71:45.65]I'm going for greed.
[71:46.55]I am.
[71:46.91]I'm sorry, guys.
[71:56.41]I got plenty of growth.
[72:01.99]Holy shit.
[72:02.81]Pack of dragonflies.
[72:04.85]You want to join me?
[72:06.39]I'll let you... You can join me if you want.
[72:10.59]Awed by the power of your forces begin to scatter.
[72:12.47]I...
[72:30.24]Water Elemental Conflux?
[72:42.45]These things are so good, but I don't have enough room!
[72:47.41]Look at all this, it's so wonderful!
[72:51.42]There's so much!
[72:54.02]Lots of... Okay, this Royal Griffin's guarding.
[72:56.90]There's like, mini-boss, and then actual boss.
[73:02.65]So I gotta be careful down here.
[73:07.17]Delete the dwarves.
[73:08.55]Delete the dwarves.
[73:13.67]Just get another hero.
[73:14.83]Alright, I'm gonna get another hero and I'm gonna walk him over here.
[73:20.91]Hold on.
[73:21.27]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[73:22.03]I'm getting a little overwhelmed.
[73:23.07]I'm not gonna lie.
[73:23.71]I'm getting kind of overwhelmed.
[73:26.29]Um, what?
[73:27.17]Hold on.
[73:28.33]I need a capital.
[73:29.55]I need a castle.
[73:31.15]I need 5,000 gold.
[73:36.61]Let me just get to... Hold on.
[73:38.81]I'm overwhelming myself.
[73:42.32]I need the money.
[73:43.68]I need the... So, look at how much I have.
[73:45.46]100 fucking ore.
[73:47.12]30... I'm so stacked on resources this game, but I don't have any money.
[73:54.65]Let me just fill it up.
[73:59.96]Alright, he's not coming this way.
[74:01.30]He's not coming this way.
[74:02.20]Oh, look at all this stuff.
[74:05.30]Always experience or should I take the money?
[74:19.45]XP is priceless.
[74:20.59]I know it is.
[74:25.40]money money for the army I'm getting greedy basic sorcery expert first aid level six and there's all this up here I wonder if I can take some of this
[74:53.49]5% more damage.
[74:54.29]I'll take it.
[74:55.67]Nothing else this way.
[74:58.53]I got mercenary camp plus one attack.
[75:02.49]Head back here.
[75:05.58]What do we got?
[75:09.62]Castle.
[75:10.18]I need 5,000 gold.
[75:15.46]Get plenty of units stacked up.
[75:18.43]I'm gonna save.
[75:18.93]I'm not gonna spend any money.
[75:23.27]We're good.
[75:24.09]Now here's the thing.
[75:25.67]A pack of Pit Lords.
[75:28.59]I can definitely take them.
[75:31.73]There's only a pack.
[75:34.47]And it's a fucking gold mine behind them.
[75:42.40]I mean, they're dangerous.
[75:43.80]They have a lot of health, they have a lot of damage.
[75:49.00]They do not have any ranged.
[75:55.34]I'm thinking just magic arrow.
[76:00.46]Protection from fire.
[76:01.46]That makes no... I think I'm just gonna have to zap.
[76:10.77]Okay.
[76:11.69]Don't go anywhere.
[76:12.19]They're probably slow.
[76:13.49]What's their speed?
[76:14.47]Seven.
[76:16.35]They can go far.
[76:17.87]I think they can fly.
[76:19.99]Just hold back.
[76:21.15]Hold back.
[76:21.49]I just want to see.
[76:21.99]I need to see.
[76:23.77]I've got my own, like, shitty version of them.
[76:27.61]I have my, like, bargain bin knockoff version of these guys.
[76:34.18]Nobody move.
[76:34.68]Nobody do anything stupid.
[76:42.08]Send the dwarves in.
[76:43.18]Fuck them.
[76:58.39]They got whips?
[76:59.77]Alright, now I've got an opportunity to dwarf.
[77:09.77]Bloodlust the dwarves?
[77:11.07]Or just zap them.
[77:12.22]Just get rid of the stack up here.
[77:16.78]I think I'm gonna zap and just continue to fight.
[77:21.68]Give the dwarves haste.
[77:24.45]No, zap.
[77:25.50]Let's take it down to four.
[77:26.68]That's perfect.
[77:27.34]Alright, I think it's time to go in.
[77:31.22]No, not yet, not yet, not yet.
[77:32.24]Don't go in.
[77:32.90]Not you.
[77:35.38]No, he can make it!
[77:37.84]I didn't think he could make it all the way.
[77:39.51]Alright, we gotta... It's time to go.
[77:43.81]Kill him.
[77:46.71]Dead.
[77:52.25]Stay here.
[77:54.94]What the fuck did he just do?
[77:59.31]Why is he... What did he turn into?
[78:08.36]He turned into like a... He re-transformed or something?
[78:13.26]Alright.
[78:13.94]Dwarves.
[78:17.65]I can't get up there.
[78:19.03]They'll kill it eventually.
[78:21.21]What does it do?
[78:22.47]Can I see the stats?
[78:24.13]It's just kind of a shittier version.
[78:25.59]It's okay.
[78:30.33]Summon demons from dead ally.
[78:31.87]Oh, he's doing it.
[78:35.53]So he's casting it on that dead body.
[78:38.68]Okay.
[78:40.42]So he needs to die.
[78:42.80]Like, now.
[78:47.97]Send in the fucking dwarves.
[79:04.32]Fast, let's get in.
[79:10.94]If I kill this, will he revive it?
[79:15.70]But can he only... How many times can he do that?
[79:23.51]Good.
[79:23.85]Okay.
[79:26.61]I'm gonna give bloodlust to the dwarves.
[79:29.33]They're gonna show their worth.
[79:33.04]Keep the... Actually, he's blocked in right now.
[79:40.70]That's gonna stay where I am.
[79:43.58]Everybody else is gonna have to move.
[79:44.68]It's gonna... The basilisk you just have to kill.
[79:48.53]Go on, Dwarves.
[79:51.18]Nice.
[79:55.60]Surround him.
[79:58.04]Nice.
[80:02.30]One more!
[80:03.12]He got to go twice.
[80:04.52]Kill him!
[80:06.03]Thousand experience.
[80:06.91]I had some losses, but it's okay.
[80:09.33]We have a gold mine now.
[80:14.69]This is a thousand gold today.
[80:16.69]And I get plus one attack.
[80:22.06]It was a little sloppy, but it's alright.
[80:24.02]Now I wonder... A lot of centaur captains.
[80:28.19]I probably can get in.
[80:29.21]I can probably do this too.
[80:34.69]We can replace the gnolls with the elementals.
[80:36.89]Either that, or we stack.
[80:46.74]Okay, let's do what I was going to do.
[80:47.94]Castle, and then capital.
[80:53.37]Capital's next.
[81:04.20]Maybe I should... I think it's time to maybe head back.
[81:07.10]Because I don't know if it's going to be possible for me to do this.
[81:13.46]Lots of captains.
[81:15.54]And lots of griffins.
[81:16.50]But can I get that wood here?
[81:21.17]I don't think I can get through this.
[81:29.06]I'm not sure I... The Royal Griffon.
[81:32.15]Lots of Royal Griffons.
[81:35.87]I mean, this could just be like... I got plenty of stuff.
[81:40.09]Hold on.
[81:40.45]We're going to just do this.
[81:45.28]I'm going to trade the Gnolls for the Elementals.
[81:53.16]Because, I mean, they're not doing anything for me right now.
[82:00.85]What's worse?
[82:02.31]27 dwarves or 15 gnolls?
[82:03.67]6-7 defense.
[82:05.93]8-8.
[82:06.67]2-4.
[82:06.95]2-3.
[82:08.07]20 health.
[82:09.31]No, these things suck.
[82:14.76]Yeah, we're gonna replace.
[82:15.66]We're gonna get 6 water elementals.
[82:19.60]3-7.
[82:25.38]These things aren't that much better, though.
[82:30.33]They actually aren't very good.
[82:31.25]It's not worth 1800 bucks.
[82:32.09]No, it's not worth it.
[82:34.87]It's not worth it.
[82:41.14]I can stack the gnolls.
[82:42.08]Yeah, that's true.
[82:47.50]I saved it right before that, right?
[82:49.86]Like, I saved it literally right before making that turn, right?
[82:52.88]Because that's a waste of a turn.
[82:54.24]I did, right?
[82:54.48]Yeah.
[82:54.80]I mean, that was just a waste.
[83:07.25]Okay.
[83:07.81]Here we go.
[83:09.92]Already got the plus attack.
[83:10.92]Let's see if I can get through here.
[83:14.12]Do not engage.
[83:16.00]Yes!
[83:17.88]I get the two wood a day.
[83:19.06]Should I go for the... Should I... Look at this.
[83:20.86]Should I go for it?
[83:27.97]Should I go for it?
[83:29.39]I'm going for it.
[83:33.45]Oh, man.
[83:34.51]Fourteen.
[83:39.80]They're not scary at all!
[83:41.91]I thought they... Royal Gryffins, alright!
[83:44.75]I thought they were gonna be insane!
[83:46.95]These... These are gonna be easy!
[83:49.75]I was scared for nothing!
[83:56.82]Alright, I'm gonna give... I'm gonna give Bloodlust... to, um... the Basilisks, or the... maybe the Magma Elementals.
[84:06.79]No, the basilisks.
[84:08.47]Or the brocks.
[84:11.95]Checking their abilities.
[84:13.25]Unlimited retaliations.
[84:15.31]So that means that they will attack back every single time.
[84:20.74]Haste the archer.
[84:27.36]Yeah, alright.
[84:27.92]I'm going to defend.
[84:29.90]I'm going to bloodlust.
[84:31.54]I'm going to haste the dwarves, right?
[84:33.64]And just send them out there.
[84:34.74]Fuck them.
[84:36.64]Haste the Dwarves and just get them out there.
[84:42.56]Yeah.
[84:44.08]You defend.
[84:47.60]Basilisks, I'm gonna stick them right here.
[84:49.52]They're not gonna move because I think they have to go... Get the Magma out there too.
[84:57.52]Yeah.
[84:58.14]Step it out a little bit.
[85:00.70]You stay.
[85:03.70]Gnolls don't move.
[85:07.28]Let's shoot down and shoot at you.
[85:11.52]See, they can't make it.
[85:12.90]Now I'll have... Wait, why could you do that?
[85:24.43]These things suck.
[85:25.43]Just kill them.
[85:42.76]Why won't they do anything?
[85:44.38]Why are the dwarves freezing in panic?
[85:47.85]I just hasted them.
[86:07.75]They have low morale.
[86:09.63]Well, I did pretty good.
[86:11.65]And then we get all this stuff.
[86:13.69]And I might have to wait till another turn.
[86:15.71]Yes, look at all this.
[86:17.09]Artifact.
[86:17.69]Boots of speed.
[86:19.06]Gold.
[86:19.62]Oak trees.
[86:20.94]What are the... Oh, no, that's just oak trees.
[86:22.38]Okay, never mind.
[86:24.62]I thought it was wood.
[86:27.60]Okay.
[86:28.90]Things are looking up.
[86:33.37]Fifteen.
[86:33.83]Look at all this money.
[86:36.47]I think I'm going to be really greedy, and I think I'm just going to take, like, 20 grand.
[86:41.89]No, like, long game, long game, long game.
[86:47.63]Basic Scouting, or Advanced Earth Magic.
[86:54.54]Yeah.
[86:57.72]And ooh, after scouring the area, you fall upon a hidden chest containing the ancient artifact, Still Eye of the Dragon.
[87:05.67]I said that in like a YouTube voice, but I know I did, but I don't care.
[87:08.79]I'm excited about that.
[87:12.89]One on the finger, this item increases your luck and morale by plus one.
[87:16.11]Maybe the dwarves will actually fucking move now.
[87:25.04]Six mercury.
[87:26.92]Six gems.
[87:29.00]700 gold.
[87:30.72]And boots of speed.
[87:35.27]More than a feet, these boots increase a hero's movement rate over land.
[87:40.09]That's amazing.
[87:41.64]Finally.
[87:44.46]Did I miss anything?
[87:45.84]I got everything, right?
[87:50.22]I think that's good.
[87:51.16]I think I've cleaned it up.
[87:57.95]Alright.
[88:00.39]Nobody in the area.
[88:01.37]I can come back and claim some stuff, and then...
[88:04.73]Yeah, this is looking good.
[88:06.13]This is looking good.
[88:07.37]How much money do I got?
[88:08.61]Stack it up.
[88:12.93]I need 10,000 for the capital.
[88:17.36]What are we?
[88:18.20]Day 5?
[88:19.60]Let me get the wyvern nest.
[88:29.24]Take over the other cities?
[88:31.77]Yeah.
[88:32.67]I mean, I'll be able to.
[88:36.16]What do you got?
[88:37.30]Few, few, few.
[88:38.26]Dude, I think I'm gonna... Here's my plan.
[88:40.62]I did like the magical hidden secret area.
[88:44.76]I'm gonna get out of here.
[88:47.34]I'm gonna go back to the house.
[88:49.18]I'm gonna stack and have like a hundred of all these.
[88:55.30]And then this person's gonna be the conqueror.
[89:07.56]And I did just get those boots, so let's see how well they work.
[89:10.64]That's pretty good.
[89:13.18]I mean, that's pretty good.
[89:14.22]I'm going a lot further, I think.
[89:16.70]Is that just placebo effect or what?
[89:20.72]Forgot the oak.
[89:23.59]Oh, whatever.
[89:26.31]Okay, whatever.
[89:27.91]I need to turn this into a capital.
[89:29.29]Let's do... I could do... No, I could upgrade the wyvern nest for the next week.
[89:35.09]Yes.
[89:35.29]Yes.
[89:39.86]Wyvern Monarchs.
[89:42.60]70, 18, 22.
[89:43.68]That is much better.
[89:51.54]I'll have plenty of time to do other stuff.
[89:54.00]Because it's going to take another couple days for me to get back here.
[89:56.18]So I can do like the Mage Guild.
[90:00.54]Lots of Griffins.
[90:05.27]Get the fuck out of my way.
[90:16.38]Alright, let's go back.
[90:19.86]I can do... Mage Guild level 2.
[90:25.27]It's a whole bunch of resources.
[90:26.55]I can learn new spells.
[90:34.47]And let's recruit.
[90:37.09]Alright, now I'm going to save money.
[90:40.20]By the time I get back there, I want to have it be a capital.
[90:42.14]Purple's dead.
[90:47.42]Purple's heroes have abandoned him.
[90:48.70]He is banished from the land.
[90:49.78]There are now six that remain.
[90:53.63]Bye, Purple.
[90:54.45]It was really nice knowing you.
[91:00.39]Oh boy, that's a lot.
[91:01.69]Fifty.
[91:03.97]That's fifty griffins.
[91:06.81]Oh, fuck.
[91:08.04]Alright.
[91:08.80]Send in the dwarves!
[91:12.58]Send in the dwarves!
[91:17.85]Hide everybody except the dwarves.
[91:22.33]Alright!
[91:23.29]Where do you want me?
[91:26.29]Walk straight ahead into the 50 griffins.
[91:29.17]Do you think that's wise?
[91:31.66]No.
[91:33.72]Not at all.
[91:38.52]Oh!
[91:41.46]What's this?
[91:46.71]Nice!
[91:49.57]And bloodlust.
[91:51.77]And haste.
[91:55.21]Everybody else chill.
[92:00.90]We all are just watching.
[92:02.02]Is he gonna do it?
[92:02.66]Move it!
[92:08.42]I'm coming through!
[92:14.18]Death comes for you!
[92:18.67]Everybody stay.
[92:20.45]Just support the dwarves!
[92:22.15]Bloodlust.
[92:23.68]He's got extra luck!
[92:36.12]They're dead.
[92:37.66]It's okay.
[92:38.76]It's alright.
[92:42.93]They got rid of seven.
[92:46.04]Not very lucky.
[92:48.77]Six dwarves die.
[92:50.31]Oh, what a... Hmm.
[92:52.19]I gotta send the magma guys in.
[92:55.37]A new hero approaches.
[92:59.11]What?
[93:00.35]Why do I have to do this?
[93:02.94]Because you don't come from our castle.
[93:09.58]What?
[93:15.23]What does that mean?
[93:17.01]It means I can't make any of you, so I have to fill my stacks with people that I have in my castle.
[93:23.28]But didn't you see how strong I've been for you?
[93:26.96]Have you even seen what I've done for you?
[93:37.86]Well, prove it.
[93:46.37]Show me.
[93:49.23]You idiot!
[93:49.71]You let him go by!
[93:51.35]You let him go by!
[93:52.29]You shouldn't have let him do that!
[93:55.07]You've killed everybody!
[93:59.01]Come on.
[93:59.89]Show why.
[94:03.22]Now everyone's gonna fight now.
[94:05.40]Nope.
[94:06.04]Run away.
[94:08.80]Send the dolls in.
[94:10.16]Block the path.
[94:20.17]Lucky shot.
[94:21.22]Good?
[94:59.78]I'm not doing that.
[95:08.02]Purple's dead.
[95:09.98]I'm going a long way.
[95:11.86]I'm not losing all my... I'm not losing all my basilisks.
[95:18.19]To 50 griffins.
[95:20.17]Wait, purple died this time.
[95:21.51]No, purple died.
[95:23.87]Plus, I can reclaim this stuff.
[95:26.37]Yeah, no, I'm going a long way.
[95:28.92]Wait!
[95:30.16]It's Harpies.
[95:36.31]So much for not save scumming.
[95:38.05]Yeah, but sometimes you have to.
[95:45.45]I'm playing to win.
[95:47.53]I'm playing to win.
[95:48.55]See, we still have one Dwarf.
[95:52.29]Six thousand, I can do the Citadel.
[95:54.09]Capital coming up real soon.
[95:55.57]Don't buy anything.
[96:03.76]I've got a mercury factory that I'm going to reclaim.
[96:09.14]Cliff nest.
[96:11.89]Get the rocks.
[96:13.01]No, what?
[96:14.23]What are you talking about?
[96:18.23]I already cleared it out.
[96:22.13]Didn't they already like me?
[96:23.07]10,000?
[96:26.03]Not yet.
[96:34.38]A tan came in here.
[96:40.73]Well, whatever.
[96:42.77]I don't really want the rocks.
[96:45.61]I'll give you a very specific reason why.
[96:47.13]They're good, but they're kind of just going to take up space.
[96:52.90]And the dwarves and the rocks, they're good.
[96:56.50]But they're going to just take up space and I need more of my own units.
[97:03.28]Did I already go here?
[97:07.12]Everything's good now.
[97:11.40]We're just gonna make our way back down home Ten thousand I can now do the Citadel And things are looking good capital building four thousand fucking gold every single day Until our last day
[97:37.12]I can put him in the garrison.
[97:38.10]That's not a bad idea.
[97:40.86]This is what we're going to do.
[97:41.82]We're going to dump.
[97:42.36]Let's touch the rally flag first.
[97:50.16]What's over here?
[97:52.25]That's a lot of griffins to be guarding something over here for no reason.
[97:55.31]What is this?
[97:56.91]Odd.
[98:04.31]Alright, let's get the rocks, the dwarves, and the magma men in the garrison, or keep the magma men?
[98:18.80]That's good.
[98:21.12]Let us recruit.
[98:22.58]I got 6,000 gold.
[98:28.40]More hiring.
[98:28.72]Uh...
[98:37.35]How much can I do?
[98:38.15]22.
[98:40.05]That's because I'm trying to get these out of the monarchs, right?
[98:44.32]Okay, we'll do it next week.
[98:53.89]Get you guys upgraded to the better ones.
[98:56.27]I want to see where is that nest.
[98:59.92]70 health.
[99:01.50]70 health.
[99:02.32]This is 14, 14, 14 to 18.
[99:03.82]14, 14, 18 to 22.
[99:05.74]And faster.
[99:07.57]Nice.
[99:12.53]Okay.
[99:16.31]You head out of here with one dwarf, please.
[99:21.91]You're gonna transfer this dwarf.
[99:23.31]You're gonna go sit in the garrison.
[99:24.53]I'm gonna get another hero.
[99:26.65]You thought this place was called Mudshift?
[99:32.81]Let's knock out mud shit.
[99:40.72]Alright.
[99:41.92]We're back.
[99:43.72]Now we're gonna restock.
[99:51.95]Pretty damn good.
[99:52.85]Alright.
[99:54.41]I need more gnolls.
[99:55.47]I got lots of money.
[99:59.66]I'm gonna send you up to the garrison.
[100:13.10]Uh, are these balls... These balls are upgraded.
[100:16.46]Mighty Gorgons, yeah.
[100:20.32]Are they not upgraded?
[100:21.00]I thought they were.
[100:25.76]No, I did it.
[100:29.49]Hydra Ponds is the next thing coming up.
[100:32.87]Or Mage Guild level up.
[100:33.97]I think Mage Guild.
[100:37.93]Yeah, they're leveled up already.
[100:39.83]You hang out in here for a minute.
[100:46.38]You get in the garrison.
[100:55.01]Can I not put you up here?
[101:03.38]I guess he can't go in the garrison.
[101:09.06]Okay, well.
[101:16.00]I kind of need to send him out to do stuff.
[101:19.15]Okay, he's going to go explore up here while I get this hero ready to go.
[101:24.61]We went down last time.
[101:25.61]I'm going to go up.
[101:26.75]I'm going to go this way.
[101:27.97]He's just a scout at this point.
[101:35.22]One dwarf scout army.
[101:42.52]It's probably a really stupid idea, but, you know.
[101:47.02]I'm going for it.
[101:47.94]What's the worst that's going to happen?
[101:49.13]He's going to die?
[101:51.27]He's a level two.
[101:57.53]Okay, we need some more.
[101:59.49]Got more bowls.
[102:04.36]I just need more cash.
[102:06.04]I need more money.
[102:07.62]I gotta get in that.
[102:08.32]I gotta conquer.
[102:10.98]You're coming down here.
[102:11.68]What's this look like here?
[102:14.11]Several pack and then lots.
[102:16.09]Several... What is that?
[102:19.91]This is Jabarcus.
[102:27.31]Yeah.
[102:28.17]Go explore.
[102:28.77]Go explore.
[102:29.25]Get us some resources.
[102:30.05]Get us some money.
[102:36.61]I can get 27 of these.
[102:38.09]More of these.
[102:38.63]Good.
[102:39.69]73 Lizard Warriors.
[102:43.03]I might even split these up.
[102:48.32]I think I... Here's what's... Hear me out on this.
[102:51.16]Get to 100 Lizard Warriors and get a new hero that is just a, you know, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, just have all archers.
[102:57.38]Like 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15.
[103:16.25]And then send them out.
[103:18.45]Why?
[103:19.91]To lay the smack down.
[103:22.83]I don't know.
[103:31.63]You suck at this?
[103:33.19]I'm doing pretty well right now!
[103:39.41]I cl- People came to- Okay, he made it over there.
[103:43.61]You had to have lost shit for that, right?
[103:47.34]He took out three stacks of griffins.
[103:58.22]He's probably weak.
[104:00.57]No, stick with the scout.
[104:03.91]Is this Warren?
[104:05.89]Something down here, maybe?
[104:12.25]I got 5,000.
[104:13.33]It's our new week.
[104:14.39]I can get more fucking Gorgons.
[104:19.49]God damn it.
[104:20.23]I have so many of these.
[104:21.16]Alright, I think it's time to take her out again.
[104:28.16]Although, the next thing, I'm going to do a bunch of gnolls.
[104:33.12]Or should I just stack her to be unbeatable?
[104:47.30]She will be un... Okay, let me see what you lost by doing that.
[104:53.48]Guys.
[104:56.12]Guys.
[104:57.91]Those griffins joined him.
[105:03.59]If I had just walked over there, I would have probably had like a hundred griffins.
[105:23.62]Damn it.
[105:24.08]That sucks.
[105:34.62]That really sucks.
[105:36.76]Would you like to... Sure.
[105:38.37]Fourteen.
[105:40.31]Alright.
[105:40.83]Ogre Fort.
[105:43.23]Is anything down here?
[105:44.05]I wonder if... Is it worth checking to see if there's something like on the edge here?
[105:47.35]Just gonna check.
[105:48.95]Nothing.
[105:52.15]I can still kill him.
[106:03.06]Should I just go after him right now?
[106:08.66]With this army?
[106:15.86]One more day.
[106:16.86]One more day.
[106:20.12]Recruit everybody.
[106:20.78]I don't have enough money.
[106:23.62]Let him at least go through the garrison first.
[106:26.83]Yeah, that's true.
[106:32.01]There he goes.
[106:35.13]31.
[106:35.15]They're not that good.
[106:38.83]Okay, 31.
[106:39.61]Well, he's got... What the fuck?
[106:41.95]He's got six Cyclops.
[106:45.53]This is actually a good indicator to see what he's got.
[106:47.01]He's got six Cyclops.
[106:50.13]Oh, man.
[106:51.35]He's got five Behemoths.
[106:55.97]This is what throws us over the edge.
[106:57.32]Bad.
[106:57.84]Very badly.
[107:05.62]If only I had, like, tried to pursue that, I would have had these griffins.
[107:11.62]And that changes everything.
[107:16.06]Uh, I mean, I'm just gonna fly around and just have him come to us.
[107:18.84]Maybe I could take out somebody?
[107:23.92]No.
[107:25.02]It's impossible.
[107:27.43]What if the dwarves did this?
[107:31.09]I'm not gonna be able to kill one person.
[107:33.82]Yeah, this game, I can't even attack.
[107:46.65]I killed six of their riders.
[107:48.51]And yeah, he didn't even want to come down.
[107:49.53]He's coming down.
[107:52.57]Well... It's gonna be a fight!
[107:59.64]It's gonna be a fight!
[108:10.30]Give me some more archers.
[108:11.14]87 archers.
[108:24.23]He might not come all the way down.
[108:28.31]This ogre hut right here.
[108:29.49]Let me just go up this way.
[108:36.81]Claim that.
[108:39.62]I have that claim, that claim.
[108:41.16]Blue is up here.
[108:44.96]I don't think I can do anything with this.
[108:47.55]Alright, let's see what happens here.
[108:51.67]No.
[108:53.53]He just... Alright, he turned.
[109:02.53]Open field?
[109:03.25]I don't know if that's a good idea.
[109:09.49]More archers.
[109:10.18]A hundred.
[109:11.08]I have a hundred fucking archers.
[109:26.91]Let's see.
[109:27.29]Let me take a look at the garrison.
[109:32.61]He left his riders in the garrison.
[109:37.34]But he's got such power units.
[109:40.30]He's got such heavy units.
[109:43.34]He's gonna have to come to me.
[109:44.39]I'm not gonna risk it.
[109:45.99]Can I claim this and take ogres?
[109:48.91]I can.
[109:49.51]I'll do that next turn.
[109:50.31]Looks like this guy can have at least something.
[110:12.95]This is like the battle.
[110:19.41]Here it comes.
[110:21.11]Here we go.
[110:22.93]Here we go.
[110:24.25]Minimal casualties.
[110:30.70]What, did she not learn the spells?
[110:32.46]Didn't I upgrade it to level 2 or 3?
[110:35.58]I'm just going with... Who's the most dangerous here?
[110:38.40]Somebody can fly over.
[110:39.34]I'm thinking of...
[110:48.25]This is ranged.
[110:49.06]The Cyclops has to go.
[110:53.88]These two.
[110:54.44]It'll be a fight.
[111:00.61]Five Cyclops.
[111:02.87]Gotta go for it.
[111:06.11]Four.
[111:06.39]Alright, grab the bat.
[111:07.59]Don't move.
[111:10.27]There's no reason to go out there.
[111:11.29]I just have to defend.
[111:13.27]Is this... Are you ranged?
[111:14.97]I mean... Do I just dive out?
[111:18.09]Okay.
[111:21.31]These are pretty beefy.
[111:23.51]70 health, 18, 22.
[111:23.79]I mean, I could probably kill... Stay, just to defend.
[111:38.00]Alright.
[111:38.64]The bull... what's the bull's stats?
[111:41.90]Pretty beefy.
[111:42.58]I can... mmm... to stay... Hold the line!
[111:47.89]Oh!
[111:50.09]You can do that?
[111:52.39]Since when can you do that?
[111:53.77]That was an... Fuck yeah!
[112:07.30]I got to do it twice.
[112:08.20]I got to once again.
[112:09.71]Alright, now... Who do I buff with this?
[112:16.69]Should I buff the archers?
[112:21.73]I think you have to.
[112:22.35]They're the only ones that can do anything.
[112:29.61]Well, it's defense.
[112:33.69]I don't want anyone to die.
[112:34.61]They're the only ones that can do anything.
[112:37.63]Alright, now we've got the healing tent.
[112:39.63]Who got the axe thrown in their face?
[112:41.15]You did.
[112:42.81]They're getting in line here.
[112:47.21]They're not... I might not lose, like, very many at all.
[112:55.64]Magic arrow.
[112:57.68]And we'll go for... They're just in a line.
[112:59.66]This is like a diner dash.
[113:04.30]We're going for the front of the line.
[113:11.33]Catapult.
[113:49.90]Buff, buff, buff!
[113:58.50]They're trying to get in!
[114:03.55]Uhhh, crash!
[114:04.29]Nobody move.
[114:15.74]Don't ever- Nobody fucking move.
[114:23.36]Uh-oh, he's in.
[114:24.06]It's okay.
[114:26.46]He's in.
[114:26.70]He's poisoned.
[114:28.05]Get in there!
[114:28.49]Get up there!
[114:29.43]Smash him!
[114:41.85]Right in front of you.
[114:43.29]And extra lucky.
[114:44.93]Oh my god, dude.
[114:45.85]I can't... I didn't lose anybody.
[114:49.34]I'm gonna get so much experience.
[114:54.32]I lost like five people.
[114:56.62]Don't anybody move.
[114:59.64]It's too dangerous.
[115:10.74]Get the fuck out of here.
[115:20.36]He lost everything.
[115:21.58]He lost all his shit.
[115:22.68]Everybody.
[115:24.14]Blue is now in a lot of trouble.
[115:25.58]That was like their biggest units.
[115:28.74]Advanced Sorcerer.
[115:32.34]Ooh.
[115:33.56]Basic Intelligence.
[115:36.10]Maximum Spell Points or Expert Earth Magic.
[115:46.45]Gone.
[115:49.82]now we do this thing called I want my mage tower to be higher mage build level two weakness disrupting ray ice bolt quicksand all right good I'm gonna do it again tomorrow
[116:19.21]Let's go get our shit.
[116:21.47]What did he take?
[116:21.97]He only took the ore, huh?
[116:27.43]Nothing else claimed by him, except up here?
[116:34.52]The 100 archers is very strong, yeah.
[116:37.00]It's very good.
[116:39.50]I mean, this garrison is just dumb.
[116:41.50]I don't really care.
[116:42.14]I'll just get it back later.
[116:44.74]Continue the exploration!
[116:47.29]Actually, no, I wanted the ogres, right?
[116:48.73]Well, let's just... Is there anything I can claim, like, up here?
[116:52.77]Let me go up this way.
[116:54.05]Mage tower.
[116:55.77]Magic planes.
[116:57.96]Yeah, I'm just gonna wait.
[117:00.50]Here comes Tan... Oh, fine.
[117:03.76]You don't... Wait.
[117:04.50]Oh.
[117:17.22]Burger Prince is dead.
[117:20.52]Is Burger Prince out?
[117:21.26]Burger Prince doesn't have anybody.
[117:25.57]I think we just retreat here.
[117:26.55]There's no reason to have anybody do this.
[117:28.91]One dwarf and fourteen trolls.
[117:32.87]That's it.
[117:33.31]See you later.
[117:38.80]The cowardly Geralt flees from battle.
[117:43.22]It doesn't matter.
[117:50.91]Mage Tower.
[117:52.79]Level 3.
[117:53.09]Let's take a look.
[117:59.26]Earthquake.
[118:00.36]Randomly damages two sections of castle wall in combat.
[118:04.72]Half the selected enemy unit forgets to use its ranged attack.
[118:08.24]And Fireball.
[118:09.94]Burst into flames, fire damage to the target and adjacent units.
[118:19.58]Alright.
[118:22.09]It is time to take you out.
[118:24.39]I now have a very, very good, formidable offense.
[118:34.93]Well, maybe I should do one more day.
[118:36.69]Yeah, well, next week.
[118:38.46]One week.
[118:39.82]Two more days.
[118:41.72]Two more days.
[118:42.26]That's it.
[118:42.64]Just two more days.
[118:49.48]Do that.
[118:49.80]Two more days.
[118:56.58]God damn it, man.
[118:59.85]And that will get me another tower in the... No, I got a level 3.
[119:05.71]Cage of Warlords.
[119:07.09]Defense and Strength.
[119:09.25]Plus 2 to a Garrison.
[119:10.35]No, just save.
[119:14.39]Hydra Pond.
[119:15.97]I could get Hydras!
[119:21.99]That can be on another hero, though.
[119:23.13]I gotta get out.
[119:23.67]I gotta get moving.
[119:26.14]I've got to get out here.
[119:33.34]What did Tan... Hold on, did Tan just like... I can kill him right now.
[119:42.95]It's time to go.
[119:46.77]I can do it right now.
[119:48.11]Give me more hide.
[119:48.77]Give me more of these.
[119:52.09]I got to get somebody out there.
[119:53.15]Look at this.
[119:53.45]This army is fucking insane.
[120:00.05]35, like, 20, 30 bulls, 116 archers.
[120:03.55]I, I, let's just, I gotta get, I gotta start conquering.
[120:11.70]This is good, because then another hero can start stacking.
[120:21.44]I got all the spells learned, right?
[120:23.17]Okay.
[120:29.98]Do I have the spells learned?
[120:39.97]No, I do.
[120:40.43]Okay.
[120:56.56]Come on!
[120:57.66]I still...
[121:00.59]Sell the ore.
[121:02.13]But I need it.
[121:04.03]It's only 25.
[121:16.78]How much are dragonflies?
[121:19.22]For one?
[121:19.68]Oh god, he's like two grand.
[121:47.10]Ugh!
[121:48.52]That's so many, come on!
[121:50.70]What else can I do?
[121:51.38]A little bit, no.
[121:57.83]No, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it.
[122:04.57]125 gnolls.
[122:07.88]126 gnolls.
[122:10.30]Let's go.
[122:11.64]A new hero can come in tomorrow.
[122:14.36]I am stacked.
[122:15.58]No one will fucking defeat me.
[122:17.22]At this stage.
[122:18.00]Not even close.
[122:18.62]There's just hobgoblins hanging out over here now.
[122:24.64]Oh, it's because it's the month of the hobgoblin.
[122:28.62]Oh, well that makes sense.
[122:29.62]Nobody in this garrison.
[122:30.50]Go.
[122:38.17]Why would you... Lots of hobgoblins.
[122:40.99]Get out of the fucking way!
[122:44.20]Why do I have to go all the way around?
[122:47.26]I can't just... Hey, thanks for killing it.
[122:53.60]He's dead.
[123:15.11]Goodbye.
[123:17.51]Oh, you are pathetic.
[123:19.46]Look at your pathetic armies next to my large army with all of the dragons and the magma and the... Earthquake.
[123:28.72]Oh, do you have fucking fireball?
[123:32.95]Oh, what's that?
[123:34.21]Oh, sorry.
[123:35.33]Am I gonna fireball the fuck out of you?
[123:44.28]I'm thinking Fireball of the Centaurs.
[123:46.28]Whoa, what's this?
[123:49.64]What's like the Cousin It?
[123:51.38]Psychic Elemental.
[123:53.00]Attacks all adjacent enemies without retaliation.
[123:55.42]Mind spell immunity.
[123:56.60]Okay, kill this immediately.
[123:58.60]Fireball down here.
[123:59.34]That's not a mind spell.
[124:04.82]Fireball.
[124:05.68]Hit the griffon and hit everything down here.
[124:09.13]Bingo.
[124:11.99]You got nothing.
[124:13.78]You have nothing.
[124:17.26]And in fact, I could probably fly over with my bugs and just start killing.
[124:23.98]But maybe I won't.
[124:44.40]Get out of here.
[124:49.70]You realize what was happening.
[124:51.18]That's what happened.
[124:54.60]Um, he must have had something really, really good.
[125:00.63]Because, why would you... I mean, he retreated.
[125:02.97]He deleted all those minions.
[125:06.37]Alright, we're gonna go up.
[125:09.29]Up here.
[125:09.61]Let's hit the rally point.
[125:16.21]He is... Let me look at... What is she up to?
[125:21.22]Oh, it's... No, it's Jabrakis.
[125:25.04]Huh.
[125:31.86]Hmm.
[125:39.31]Wait!
[125:48.04]New hero time.
[125:48.94]Uh, Merlanda the Witch or Luna the Old Enemy?
[126:03.47]I think it's gonna have to be... Elementalist or Witch?
[126:15.34]The Witch.
[126:19.84]Let's get you some minions.
[126:23.99]Pretty cool.
[126:24.85]Pretty good.
[126:26.59]Witch.
[126:27.75]What's your specialty?
[126:29.37]Is weakness.
[126:32.13]Better effect.
[126:33.13]In just a moment, after another week, you're going to be heading out yourself with a stacked group of... minions.
[126:49.12]It's a stacked group of midlands.
[126:55.02]Just nothing over here.
[126:55.67]Somebody already took it.
[126:59.11]All right, super north or right?
[127:01.65]I think I want to do... What's a sanctuary?
[127:05.01]I want to go that way.
[127:09.31]Super north?
[127:10.83]No, look at this.
[127:11.79]A thousand experience!
[127:19.46]Sanctuary.
[127:23.45]Great weight has been lifted.
[127:24.53]You feel safe.
[127:25.39]I don't think I can be attacked here.
[127:31.36]I don't think I can be attacked.
[127:35.16]I'm going up this way.
[127:38.56]Um, what do you got over here?
[127:40.59]This is a little standoff.
[127:48.47]Should I check the hole?
[127:53.93]Nothing in the hole.
[127:55.47]Why did the fucking hole just make me do that?
[127:57.41]I, like, didn't even want to do that!
[128:02.20]Hole.
[128:04.52]Uh, well, hydra pond.
[128:09.92]How much are the upgraded hydras?
[128:12.82]I can do it tomorrow.
[128:23.85]I don't like that route you're taking.
[128:25.56]It's really pissing me off.
[128:26.72]Alright, I'm gonna go Beige Tower.
[128:32.02]No, up here.
[128:32.62]I want this experience.
[128:34.16]It's a thousand experience.
[128:37.23]A thousand EXP.
[128:38.23]There is a sawmill right here.
[128:40.05]Grab this.
[128:50.54]Almost there.
[128:51.00]Fifteen thousand.
[129:00.15]Mmm, taking all my shit.
[129:01.09]Something that way.
[129:05.50]Yep, sulfur.
[129:14.28]14,000.
[129:14.30]I'm almost there.
[129:14.94]And I'll have ultra hydras.
[129:24.18]He's coming after you?
[129:26.22]I don't think he is.
[129:30.15]I mean, I'm about to meet him.
[129:31.99]I'm about to go down that way.
[129:36.14]Okay, this is his, like, shitty guy.
[129:42.04]He's got, like, a few, few, few, and a bunch of dumb skeletons.
[129:45.78]This is his main.
[129:48.82]Might be time for an open field battle.
[129:54.40]And then... Head up this way.
[129:57.06]Or head down here.
[129:58.28]And check out the other quadrant.
[130:02.66]Where you off to?
[130:17.83]Did you just recruit those?
[130:18.69]Or did you kill them?
[130:19.81]I swear to god if you recruited them.
[130:22.99]Nope.
[130:23.79]You had to fight them.
[130:31.07]Hello!
[130:38.76]Upgraded Hydra Pond.
[130:42.38]Chaos Hydras.
[130:44.08]Regular Hydras, 135 health, 250 health.
[130:47.66]Attacks all adjacent enemies and enemies cannot retaliate.
[130:51.52]21 defense.
[131:11.20]In a few days, you'll be able to take your adventure of your own.
[131:16.16]Your move.
[131:18.50]Oh, don't get away from him, he's so strong!
[131:20.04]That's right, get the fuck out of here.
[131:25.83]Let me back my stuff.
[131:33.13]Well, he's dead now.
[131:37.52]I got you locked in here.
[131:39.54]You got a boat?
[131:42.64]I don't see a boat!
[131:47.04]Did you get them?
[131:48.38]Did you take those worthless things?
[131:51.56]Oh, you did, didn't you?
[131:52.38]Here comes Tan!
[132:07.05]Uh-oh, there's a battle going on over here!
[132:14.46]Okay.
[132:16.92]No, that's mine.
[132:17.88]Here we go.
[132:24.32]Here comes the big one.
[132:30.68]Fireball weakness, maybe.
[132:33.60]Or just Fireball.
[132:35.60]Right in the middle here.
[132:38.98]Fireball right here.
[132:39.70]This will get all three of them.
[132:43.16]We'll Fireball down here.
[132:46.48]Do I want to hit more units or do I want to get rid of the water minions?
[132:51.86]I think I'm thinking right in the middle here.
[132:52.92]This is perfect.
[132:56.22]I get the tent too.
[132:58.47]Let's go for it.
[132:58.97]Yeah.
[133:02.87]I hope that was worth like $3,000.
[133:03.67]Okay.
[133:12.19]The big bad guy here is the behemoth.
[133:16.19]Oh, 300 fucking health.
[133:19.25]Focus be- Oh, this is not good.
[133:20.77]I gotta focus the behemoth.
[133:25.45]Actually, like, fucking... It's 1,200 HP.
[133:31.79]Uh, I don't know if I wanna- Do I just- I think it's time to- We just gotta go in.
[133:34.85]How many are here?
[133:35.37]250 hobgoblins.
[133:43.31]Who's ranged here?
[133:50.12]I don't think they have ranged.
[133:51.06]Unless these guys throw axes or something, right?
[133:53.90]Don't these guys throw?
[133:54.92]No?
[133:56.66]No, they don't have any ranged.
[133:57.66]Well, they... No, they don't.
[134:01.57]No fucking ranged at all.
[134:03.95]I just got fucking... Alright, I gotta fight back here.
[134:16.53]Oh, you can move across the whole fucking map!
[134:31.95]I'm gonna have to... Petrifying attack.
[134:43.37]You gotta go.
[134:43.83]I just have to try to help and get rid of you.
[134:47.23]Nice.
[134:49.05]Come on, let me go with the Gorgon.
[134:50.77]Alright.
[134:53.07]Should we send him to slime?
[134:55.39]Okay, I'm gonna buff Gorgon.
[134:58.49]Buff Gorgon.
[134:59.41]Gorgon, go after the Behemoth.
[135:04.95]Sacrifice the Magmus?
[135:06.05]No, no, no, no, no.
[135:06.61]We're gonna slime.
[135:08.55]Slime the Gorgons.
[135:09.86]Here we go.
[135:17.01]Death Stare.
[135:23.64]Protection.
[135:25.32]Go for it.
[135:26.76]Here we go.
[135:32.78]What the fuck just happened?
[135:35.28]I just killed two.
[135:39.14]I just killed two Behemoths in one hit!
[135:42.87]Are you kidding me?
[135:47.95]I get to go again!
[135:48.73]Oh, nice!
[135:49.85]Goddammit, I could've been able to attack you.
[135:52.49]Ah, just... Oh, he's still alive!
[135:58.39]He's still alive!
[136:05.53]Uh-oh!
[136:07.37]Alright, Snake is gonna go.
[136:09.69]Take out the minions in the back here.
[136:12.72]Right here.
[136:14.16]Wait.
[136:16.00]Fireball.
[136:16.96]These guys.
[136:20.36]I might be able to get rid of most of them.
[136:22.90]Or Fireball right here.
[136:31.21]I think I'm going to Fireball right in the middle.
[136:34.43]And then do Bloodlust.
[136:41.76]I could...
[136:48.91]That was good.
[136:49.27]That was pretty good.
[136:50.21]Alright, now clean him up.
[136:51.81]Snake.
[136:53.03]Into the back.
[136:55.51]Snipe.
[136:56.23]There's only three there.
[136:57.30]Snipe in the back.
[137:02.88]Ow.
[137:03.74]Okay.
[137:04.66]Dragon.
[137:07.72]Go for Behemoth?
[137:09.65]I think we still have to surround the Behemoth.
[137:15.85]What does he have?
[137:16.57]Two?
[137:16.67]He might have one.
[137:17.31]Okay.
[137:28.42]Alright, only one more.
[137:29.42]Where are you going?
[137:29.88]You're going to the archers.
[137:31.22]No, you're not.
[137:32.66]You're going... Why would you go for the gnolls?
[137:40.04]He's dead.
[137:40.50]252 of these guys coming in.
[137:42.42]Oh, wow.
[137:43.92]Magma, get in there!
[137:46.54]214!
[137:47.06]I just killed like 60!
[137:52.22]Bulls!
[137:54.22]Up here!
[137:54.68]Up here!
[137:55.00]Up here!
[137:55.24]Up here!
[137:56.68]Kill the Hydra!
[137:57.97]The dragon!
[137:59.63]Yes!
[138:04.03]I still can't- I can't cast any spells.
[138:05.57]Alright, bring them out.
[138:09.71]Bring out the gnolls.
[138:14.07]I win.
[138:17.36]There were some casualties.
[138:22.60]But... I mean, like... I did it.
[138:30.39]Basic logistics.
[138:31.67]Movement over land.
[138:32.71]Yes.
[138:34.65]Advanced logistics.
[138:35.67]20% more movement over land.
[138:39.87]That's awesome.
[138:42.65]Let me get this back.
[138:43.71]It's already there.
[138:46.59]Okay.
[138:48.23]Looking good.
[138:49.43]Now what about you?
[138:51.12]You have several big scary birds.
[138:56.62]I'm gonna keep moving with this group.
[138:59.12]I want to come back up here.
[139:00.10]Claim.
[139:03.27]I claimed my stuff back.
[139:04.59]Nothing else.
[139:05.35]Does this just disappear?
[139:08.13]Back to the citadel.
[139:09.53]Let's get another team going.
[139:22.01]Now you're coming down here.
[139:23.15]Okay, why do I always have to deal with the fucking asshole that has this shitload of enemies?
[139:29.21]I keep preventing you from coming down.
[139:30.87]Alright.
[139:31.19]I need to head back out again.
[139:49.57]You guys are just taking up space.
[139:53.18]Okay, there we go.
[139:58.08]48 of these.
[139:58.54]There's no room.
[140:01.90]Because of... What's taking up the room here?
[140:07.30]I have to go restock.
[140:08.30]I got these Chaos Hydras, though, so these things are fucking insane.
[140:10.84]Oh, there's two gnolls.
[140:13.68]What the fuck?
[140:18.87]Alright.
[140:20.39]Restock!
[140:25.79]I'll be able to have probably five... I'll have at least five Chaos Hydras.
[140:30.41]Which, now I become the behemoth.
[140:32.65]Right?
[140:35.05]No, do I want to get up here and claim... Did you take anything else over here?
[140:38.19]He took this.
[140:39.17]I want this back.
[140:43.96]What is it?
[140:45.58]Sulphur?
[140:46.44]Is it worth me taking a detour?
[140:47.82]No, just get back.
[140:53.52]Just get back into town.
[140:54.56]Not worth taking a detour for.
[140:59.74]Alright.
[141:04.36]Now.
[141:06.21]Here we go.
[141:07.53]Bang.
[141:08.25]Bang.
[141:09.05]Bang.
[141:09.99]Bang.
[141:12.21]Magma.
[141:14.03]Magma has to be traded.
[141:16.33]For chaos?
[141:20.76]I mean, I have five chaos hydras...
[141:23.80]Magma or... I mean, this is a destructive team.
[141:34.00]You can keep the gnolls.
[141:35.72]Gnolls for magma.
[141:39.90]Yeah, the magma can't be replenished.
[141:42.23]That's true.
[141:51.53]I could wait another day.
[141:55.02]Yeah, I'm gonna leave Magma.
[141:56.30]But I'm gonna wait one more day.
[142:03.54]Because I want... I want to take more.
[142:16.42]I want more.
[142:23.27]One more week.
[142:28.10]Give me more.
[142:38.51]Okay.
[142:39.93]Hey, red.
[142:40.27]Oh, you're fucking dead.
[142:52.26]Okay.
[142:52.64]Okay.
[142:53.02]I want some archery.
[142:56.24]No.
[142:56.78]Just go.
[142:57.06]I'm ready.
[142:57.40]Okay.
[142:59.08]Save it.
[143:06.85]Red has... Okay, what denomination turns into a throng?
[143:11.87]Is it 100?
[143:12.05]Or is it more than 100?
[143:19.29]It's 100 plus, okay.
[143:21.79]So I have a throng of... And then, what, lots is between, what, 50 and 100?
[143:28.73]Okay.
[143:37.30]I mean, this is very equal.
[143:39.32]It's very even.
[143:40.32]And a horde is, what, more than 500?
[143:43.10]Okay.
[143:47.33]A horde is getting to me.
[143:52.33]Alright, I'm going up.
[143:54.33]It's time.
[143:54.81]I'm not coming back again.
[143:55.95]I've got my army.
[143:57.13]This is the army that I'm going to use.
[144:00.13]I'm going straight up.
[144:01.59]No, no, no.
[144:02.09]I can't go straight up.
[144:03.45]I can say, yeah, I can.
[144:05.65]So whatever's left, I need to start taking cities and buildings and stuff.
[144:12.37]Red's going to make their way to the right.
[144:13.91]I'm going to go north.
[144:19.79]I'm going right up that road.
[144:25.18]And I'm gonna have a second army.
[144:26.22]Yeah, I'll have a second army.
[144:29.86]Let's go investigate what's up here.
[144:31.34]Is it a road?
[144:32.22]It does lead to here.
[144:33.22]I'll take this.
[144:37.19]And there's a little lake here.
[144:38.23]I'm not gonna forget about my second hero.
[144:50.46]Keep going.
[144:58.62]Nobody in your garrison.
[145:01.11]It's mine now.
[145:02.47]Alright, we're crossing into uncharted territory.
[145:05.77]Another?
[145:06.15]You have two garrisons!
[145:07.31]Ooh, this is like Undead World.
[145:16.99]I can't even go up there.
[145:27.64]Alright, starting to build a little bit of a force here.
[145:29.36]I got the magma guy here.
[145:31.58]What about building?
[145:32.64]Blood obelisk.
[145:33.34]I'm going to do some of these.
[145:38.56]Plus two to a garrison hero's attack when defending against a siege.
[145:41.14]I'm going to get it.
[145:49.77]I'm going for red's castle.
[145:53.05]I think red is up here, right?
[145:54.39]Red or tan?
[145:56.35]Blue's dead.
[146:02.15]Blue is no more.
[146:04.05]There are five remaining.
[146:05.27]Tons of resources up here that I can just take.
[146:12.72]Should I go up here?
[146:13.46]I feel like this is... I need to see what it is!
[146:18.06]Anything else?
[146:22.74]Cage of Warlords.
[146:24.12]Increases the defense of the hero.
[146:28.53]She just gets plus one defense, and I think I am maxed the fuck out, besides the shipyard.
[146:34.64]This is my ultra capital.
[146:46.13]Here he comes.
[146:47.69]Teal is dead.
[146:51.03]Uh-oh!
[146:53.81]No!
[147:01.48]Is there a castle up here?
[147:04.84]I hope you've got it.
[147:06.16]Ah, it's not a castle!
[147:07.94]I thought that was a castle.
[147:18.97]Hold on.
[147:19.31]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[147:20.65]He might not come all the way down here.
[147:22.37]He might not come down here.
[147:24.73]Nope.
[147:27.32]He didn't come down.
[147:29.94]We're good.
[147:39.50]Something's right fucking here.
[147:42.88]All right, we just made, okay, give me those chaos hydras.
[147:47.91]Give me some of these wyverns, bulls.
[147:51.51]Okay, we're, everything's gonna be all right.
[148:20.58]He's got fucking phoenixes.
[148:25.79]Well...
[148:47.34]I kind of just lose.
[148:48.95]There's not much I can do.
[148:49.93]I might have to reload.
[148:50.73]There's not much that can be done.
[149:05.17]I think if I lose this castle, I lose.
[149:18.31]Because I was wasting time.
[149:19.27]Well, I thought there could have been a town up there.
[149:23.56]It don't matter.
[149:25.16]I'm just gonna go straight this time.
[149:28.36]And I'll be able to take a castle.
[149:39.77]Straight from the road?
[149:40.61]Yeah, but I mean, there's like tons of little paths you can go around.
[149:44.44]Alright, I think I lose.
[149:47.18]No, not quite.
[149:49.06]Green's dead.
[149:50.18]You only have seven days to capture a town or you'll be banished from the land.
[149:53.18]I mean, I would have done things differently.
[150:02.89]I would have done it a little differently.
[150:09.88]Let's just see what's up here.
[150:15.50]This is orange.
[150:20.82]Do you have a castle right here?
[150:29.00]How far up is your castle?
[150:30.20]Looks like all the way up there, huh?
[150:43.89]Take it?
[150:44.37]I mean, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to take it.
[150:45.71]I might have to reload.
[150:48.47]New home.
[150:51.83]I don't know if it's gonna be new home.
[150:57.14]It might be.
[150:57.58]Let's find out.
[150:58.70]New home?
[151:00.88]Let's see if it's new home.
[151:06.94]Hey, can I have your house?
[151:25.96]Oh, I have Earthquake!
[151:27.10]Oh my god, I'm just so distracted by how annoyed I am at losing my fucking capital.
[151:35.07]Well, we can just get in.
[151:35.85]Where should I go after here?
[151:38.15]I'm using a Fireball and a Siege.
[151:46.48]I'll probably win this, but... At what cost?
[151:49.90]250 health.
[151:54.11]Two to five damage.
[151:55.25]It's not going to be enough.
[151:56.08]It's not going to kill it.
[151:57.34]I'm going to try.
[151:57.78]I'm going to kill the bulls.
[151:59.80]Or the basilisks.
[152:02.02]I'm going to be able to kill the...
[152:12.66]Mmm, I'm just gonna go for, like, the fucking basilisks.
[152:17.17]They have the least amount of health.
[152:18.97]Or the... We'll just go right here and see what happens.
[152:21.51]Kill it in one hit?
[152:22.39]Yes.
[152:23.39]I get to go again.
[152:24.31]Perfect.
[152:26.87]I'm gonna get minimal losses here and it won't be a complete waste.
[152:32.99]Lie in with the dragon.
[152:34.13]And, yeah, just kill that.
[152:47.05]Why would you attack this?
[152:50.04]Basilisk can't get in?
[152:51.00]You can move over.
[152:56.44]Can you not get in either?
[152:57.22]Hydra can't get in.
[153:04.06]Nobody else can get in, actually.
[153:07.63]It's the same faction.
[153:08.71]Yeah, we might just be trading castles.
[153:18.25]Not dead.
[153:20.55]You're still alive.
[153:23.45]That seems fucking ridiculous.
[153:24.63]There's only one of you.
[153:34.60]Kill it.
[153:35.96]Holy shit.
[153:38.39]How do you still have one?
[153:40.33]I've done like four or five hundred damage.
[153:43.43]What the fuck?
[154:01.17]Alright, I can do this.
[154:06.07]Didn't do anything.
[154:07.57]I still can't get in there.
[154:11.18]That didn't do anything.
[154:17.36]It just, like, shook the ground for a second.
[154:24.45]Who's in here?
[154:24.95]Still you, the bulls.
[154:27.78]What do you got, 11?
[154:29.20]Let's go to the bulls.
[154:34.32]I'm not even fucking hurting these things.
[154:43.29]95 archers can't even kill one bull.
[154:48.03]You guys are fucking kidding me.
[155:01.25]That's 39 of these things.
[155:03.89]Hooray!
[155:16.75]Hello!
[155:23.35]Kill.
[155:24.87]Kill.
[155:26.92]I'll go in next.
[155:41.72]I'm gonna be healing somebody.
[155:47.52]Can you move, please?
[155:48.70]Uh... What should I do?
[155:52.56]Fucking... Just magic arrow.
[155:54.54]Icebolt.
[155:54.96]136... Let's just icebolt this motherfucker.
[155:58.04]Let's kill him.
[156:01.16]And there's just the gnolls.
[156:02.26]And I have a new town.
[156:03.84]I kinda died.
[156:06.53]But I lost a lot, but I'll get a ton of experience. 4,400.
[156:12.48]It's the same town.
[156:14.94]It's the same one.
[156:17.32]Let's just hope that they build up their town as much as I built up mine.
[156:23.74]Expert sorcery.
[156:28.98]50% more damage.
[156:32.88]What does it look like?
[156:36.69]Alright, well you don't... You don't have a capital, but I can get that very soon.
[156:43.36]What about the dickhead that's right here?
[156:44.84]He's gonna pa- kill him right now.
[156:46.84]Wipe out- I'm gonna kill green.
[156:47.78]I'm literally gonna wipe out orange.
[156:51.78]I have enough to get rid of him, I think.
[156:54.92]He only- he has like a pack, lots, pack, pack.
[156:57.32]He doesn't have like- he's several.
[157:00.14]Not green, I'm talking about orange.
[157:02.02]Yeah, I think I can take him.
[157:06.23]Let him attack, but I don't think he won't.
[157:07.57]He'll run away.
[157:09.19]He's gonna run away.
[157:12.51]I want to eliminate Orange.
[157:28.64]Here we go.
[157:31.12]Because I've got 5, he has 5.
[157:32.72]I have 12, he has 10.
[157:33.78]Yeah, I'm gonna win this.
[157:36.60]I've got 39 fucking bullets, he's dead.
[157:43.08]160.
[157:43.12]Yeah, these guys are terrible.
[157:44.74]This is like having gnolls.
[157:46.40]They're not that good.
[157:48.60]Alright, priority target is the titans.
[157:55.73]Could just throw a fireball over here and... We'll throw a fireball here.
[158:03.17]Or I could do bloodlust on the hydras.
[158:09.54]Or I could... Yeah, I could do an ice bolt on the titans.
[158:13.61]Actually, I like that idea.
[158:14.69]I like Ice Bolt on the Titans.
[158:17.09]Or Weakness.
[158:20.11]Or... I don't know about that.
[158:22.37]Randomly places eight small patches of quicksand on the battlefield, which are only visible to the caster and creatures native to the terrain.
[158:28.91]Walking into quicksand ends a unit's movement for the turn and makes it visible.
[158:35.65]I'll Bolt him.
[158:42.07]Took away one.
[158:44.39]Uh, none of them have a lot of movement besides the genie, and the genie flying over here would be, like, a terrible mistake.
[158:50.87]So, I'm gonna bring you up here.
[158:53.81]I think I'm just gonna wait.
[158:57.83]Or maybe I'll bring you up here.
[158:58.61]Up above, and then fly in.
[159:03.23]Yeah, that's the plan.
[159:08.29]And I'll take you guys out by jumping in.
[159:09.97]Because the range is up here.
[159:15.23]I get to go again.
[159:16.07]Unbelievable.
[159:16.61]Okay, just kill them all in one hit.
[159:18.61]Or the mages.
[159:19.27]No, I want to be away from those.
[159:20.75]Kill them all.
[159:21.71]165.
[159:21.79]I just killed over 100, didn't I?
[159:29.39]Wait, only... What?
[159:32.17]I only killed 8?
[159:35.18]No.
[159:35.52]Who died?
[159:36.18]Yeah, I killed 100.
[159:39.21]Alright, now I'm going to meet you halfway.
[159:41.41]I'm coming up this way.
[159:42.99]What's your movement here?
[159:43.83]Five?
[159:45.61]Seven?
[159:45.87]I'm going to move, like, here.
[159:50.14]Same with you.
[159:50.78]You can go that way as well.
[159:54.80]Balls into the same thing.
[159:55.92]They're just dead.
[160:01.21]Good.
[160:01.51]Nulls come in.
[160:09.56]Priority is still the Titans, so... Or... Yeah, they are.
[160:19.78]I now can... Let's heal you.
[160:24.84]Exactly what I wanted you to do.
[160:26.56]That's exactly what I wanted.
[160:30.60]So now, I think I'm going to fly you down here.
[160:35.87]Let's go from this angle.
[160:38.11]So I'm not surrounded.
[160:39.11]Maybe I'll fly you down.
[160:41.81]Into the mages.
[160:44.47]Locked.
[160:46.81]21 mages perish.
[160:49.49]He still has to walk all the way.
[160:50.58]Good.
[160:50.76]I don't care if you kill them.
[160:53.36]That's fine with me.
[160:56.02]And we're going to go with genies.
[160:58.88]Yeah, definitely attack the genies.
[161:00.10]From this side, because I want to be able to move the hydras over here too.
[161:09.24]13 genies dead.
[161:09.84]Again.
[161:11.46]Actually, no.
[161:12.63]Let's kill the genies.
[161:14.71]No, no, no.
[161:15.83]You go up here.
[161:17.73]These titans are going to come for the archers.
[161:19.27]Let me see here.
[161:23.45]Ice Bolt again on the... Down to two.
[161:29.27]Yeah, you can stick right behind.
[161:34.99]Because he's going to kill the gnoll in like one swing, so I might as well just block it so he can't get to the archers.
[161:45.92]Absolutely crumbled.
[161:47.63]One last shot.
[161:48.69]It's okay.
[161:49.51]You're not that strong.
[161:53.83]Nice.
[162:02.10]Genie's dead.
[162:02.80]Genie's not dead.
[162:04.68]Genie's still alive.
[162:07.44]Miraculously.
[162:14.32]Kill the genies.
[162:16.74]Get rid of them.
[162:22.25]Get rid of the mage.
[162:27.19]Now we just have to deal with you.
[162:32.25]Ow.
[162:32.31]That's what you run into.
[162:34.87]Alright, what do I got?
[162:37.67]Uh, weakness!
[162:40.21]I can't cast it, don't have any more.
[162:41.39]Fuck.
[162:43.51]No, I can do Bloodlust on... I can do Bloodlust on the Greater Basilisks.
[162:54.68]Bing.
[162:56.80]Surround!
[163:05.88]You're pretty beefy.
[163:17.13]One left.
[163:19.09]Can I do like a magic arrow?
[163:21.03]Fuck.
[163:23.42]No bloodlust.
[163:24.82]Looks like you're just gonna have to hang out over here.
[163:30.66]No!
[163:32.74]Damn it!
[163:37.19]Come on.
[163:40.75]One fucking left.
[163:41.63]You retreat with one person left?
[163:44.49]That's so infuriating.
[163:47.41]I think you shouldn't be able to retreat if you've been in the match for more than, like, a minute.
[163:53.53]What the fuck?
[163:56.63]If you've been fighting for, like, two minutes, I think you'd retreat is not an option.
[164:02.55]You could go with one person left and you can run away and keep all your stuff?
[164:06.54]Uh-uh.
[164:07.30]Come on.
[164:08.90]This game's 20 years old.
[164:10.64]I know.
[164:10.88]I know, but I'm fucking mad.
[164:20.07]Ah, that's pretty good.
[164:20.79]I'm gonna get that.
[164:24.01]No, this is mine now.
[164:30.77]That's all you got left is this.
[164:32.61]You don't have anything, really.
[164:35.92]I'm gonna hang out back here.
[164:41.63]No, let me see here.
[164:42.75]What have you not built?
[164:43.43]I need this citadel.
[164:45.89]Capital.
[164:47.27]But... He might come back.
[164:54.94]What about my original house?
[164:59.84]You know, orange... Okay, orange is now retreating this way.
[165:03.43]I think orange is going to come try to take my old house.
[165:05.61]Because I just took his...
[165:10.73]It's just, we're never ending trade houses with each other.
[165:13.87]He didn't even leave me anything.
[165:25.80]Mage go level 2, no capital.
[165:27.92]I gotta wait.
[165:33.22]Um, I need to go out and just start taking stuff.
[165:37.34]So, come on out.
[165:44.66]I've got this already.
[165:47.39]One attack.
[165:48.25]Yeah, just get out here and get it.
[165:49.51]There's a sanctuary right here.
[165:52.93]Fucking red.
[165:58.72]Orange.
[165:59.82]Green.
[166:01.46]Plus one attack permanently.
[166:06.44]Plus two luck.
[166:07.86]Got a gold mine down here.
[166:15.60]I still can't afford anything.
[166:16.80]Retake the old capital?
[166:24.64]Just AFK in the Sanctuary forever.
[166:26.56]I don't think I can do that.
[166:30.66]Medusas!
[166:32.97]I'll take them.
[166:35.55]And Magic Plains.
[166:36.53]This is also... It's been deserted.
[166:40.45]This Cyclops Tower.
[166:41.91]I want to get this.
[166:46.67]Shit, I want that gold mine.
[166:49.03]Or should I just... I'm already up here.
[166:50.98]Hold on.
[166:51.30]War Machine Factory.
[166:56.14]Already got it.
[166:56.86]I'll go this way.
[167:09.79]Just recruit a thousand Chaos Hydras.
[167:11.73]I could.
[167:13.65]Observatory.
[167:14.29]Let's get a good look.
[167:17.96]So this is a lot of orange, and then red is up here.
[167:26.70]So I could take this stuff.
[167:30.83]I want that gold mine.
[167:31.71]Yeah, let's get the gold mine.
[167:36.23]Thousand gold a day.
[167:43.26]And then... I don't want to be left out in the open here.
[167:45.52]I'm going to grab this, too.
[167:50.47]Is anybody else down here?
[167:51.45]I don't think anyone else is over here.
[167:57.22]New capital!
[167:58.30]Welcome to the new capital!
[168:00.00]4,000 gold a day, it's like we never left.
[168:05.89]I'm leaving the town undefended.
[168:15.29]Yeah, the town is really undefended, but there's nobody really up here.
[168:18.81]It would take at least a few, like three or four days for someone to even get over here.
[168:24.85]They're all down here.
[168:25.63]They're all fucking each other up down there.
[168:35.82]Alright, here we go.
[168:36.32]We got some population now.
[168:39.70]You are here.
[168:41.64]He's down here.
[168:44.01]Good.
[168:44.21]I hope you go down there and fucking have a problem with Tan.
[168:48.75]Because I'm going to take... You're over here.
[168:53.37]I'm not going to be that zealous.
[168:57.83]I'm just going to get this.
[169:01.84]And on the way back... Can I get under here?
[169:04.02]I can get this too.
[169:05.82]I got one zombie garrison.
[169:12.42]Yeah.
[169:17.30]Maybe this.
[169:18.46]And now I'm gonna head back.
[169:22.42]I could take that stuff, too.
[169:23.68]Let's just head back.
[169:24.36]I'm going to the Sanctuary.
[169:31.62]Chaos Hydras?
[169:32.30]Alright, thankfully this guy had everything equipped.
[169:34.20]Everything was done.
[169:36.77]So let's buy some stuff.
[169:44.89]He doesn't have the Lizard Warriors, though?
[169:49.94]Oh, he does.
[169:50.42]Hold on.
[169:51.08]Yeah, he does.
[169:51.54]Okay.
[169:54.96]Okay.
[169:55.46]Let's head back there and try to stock up.
[170:11.77]Is he playing with one hero?
[170:13.79]Well, the problem is I... I'm trying to get, like, enough of an army where I can have a second hero that is safe
[170:21.74]So everyone has so much better stuff than I do.
[170:27.75]So if I make a new hero right now, right?
[170:30.05]Then I'm gonna be thin.
[170:31.31]And if I get attacked, then it's all dead.
[170:35.59]That just happened.
[170:40.88]I was trying to build a second army to take another person out.
[170:45.22]But I keep getting just so far behind because they end up getting over here much quicker than I can.
[170:55.56]So, I can get another hero here, but I'm gonna have, like, not a whole lot of stuff.
[171:01.95]And I just lost my capital, so it's, like, even harder to keep more than one person.
[171:06.31]Uh, can I go ahead and snipe these?
[171:16.64]I can.
[171:20.64]Alright, next day.
[171:26.54]Alright.
[171:27.76]Tan just killed somebody.
[171:36.68]Tan just killed Orange's... I think Orange's last defense.
[171:43.89]Oh, that's not good.
[171:45.59]Tan becoming superpower.
[171:52.07]Woof!
[171:55.09]Alright, let's take this and then get the fuck out of here.
[172:03.41]I have almost this whole upper quadrant here, completed.
[172:05.91]Okay, give me a tavern.
[172:13.43]Demaniac.
[172:14.89]Demaniac.
[172:16.63]I mean, imps or intelligence?
[172:24.48]I feel like I'd want this.
[172:28.46]It's got, like, imps.
[172:30.26]No.
[172:31.28]I'm going with, uh... Andra.
[172:33.84]Okay, now...
[172:53.21]Take you out and go exploring.
[172:55.37]Because I can't really wait around.
[173:02.56]I can head this way.
[173:10.71]Stack?
[173:11.75]No, I...
[173:14.15]If I stack, I can only stack on one person.
[173:17.11]If I play as one person, I'm too concentrated.
[173:20.54]If I'm not concentrated, I have to try to do two heroes.
[173:25.60]I can't just stuff somebody in here and stack forever.
[173:33.03]I could try to get the old castle, but look at this.
[173:35.53]This dude is... This dude's ready to rock.
[173:39.97]I was thinking about going for whatever Orange... This is Orange's castle.
[173:43.42]This is Orange's final castle.
[173:48.30]I might just go try to get it.
[173:50.04]Because Orange just got killed by Tan, remember.
[173:57.43]I might go try to get the other castle from Orange.
[174:03.94]Let me see.
[174:04.64]I've got... I've got enough that... I got some... It's worth a try, I think.
[174:08.86]Let's save it.
[174:10.37]Because he just got wiped out.
[174:23.82]Is it worth a shot?
[174:30.52]Yeah, let's go.
[174:33.11]I'm going for it.
[174:37.43]You did the thing that I did.
[174:38.49]Are you sure this is not me playing in a different timeline?
[174:54.22]Alright, I need to take a look.
[174:58.80]What do you have over here?
[174:59.96]I can't see.
[175:00.58]I can't see what you have.
[175:03.00]Alright.
[175:08.16]You're looking alright.
[175:08.88]I'll take you out in a minute.
[175:11.53]Let's just hope you don't come attack me and kill me.
[175:24.37]There he is.
[175:24.83]Okay.
[175:25.43]I thought that was another person.
[175:28.97]Hold on.
[175:29.85]Who's in there?
[175:30.39]I just want to see what's in there.
[175:33.51]Lots, pack, several, throng, lots, lots.
[175:36.58]I can get it.
[175:41.68]You don't have any big units.
[175:43.48]I do.
[175:48.38]I'm about to destroy... I'm about to wipe out Orange.
[175:50.41]Orange is going to be out of the game.
[175:51.61]You just killed my Hydras.
[175:57.91]Alright.
[175:59.93]They don't have any big units.
[176:01.61]They don't have any... They just have, uh... Naga Queens.
[176:09.72]Earthquake.
[176:11.80]Fuck.
[176:13.24]I don't have any spell points.
[176:14.54]No!
[176:16.12]Okay, uh... Fireball.
[176:25.92]I had to rest.
[176:26.66]Yeah, but I had to, like, go all the way back.
[176:29.10]And then all the way back down here.
[176:30.42]I don't have any MP, you know.
[176:35.53]I can Ice Bolt, like, the Naga Queens.
[176:38.21]That's all I can do.
[176:43.51]Or Bloodlust somebody.
[176:46.31]I get Bloodlust the... I don't really have, like, much of a defense, though.
[176:55.08]Bloodlust the bulls, bloodlust the wyverns.
[176:57.93]I would probably bloodlust the wyverns and just get them in there.
[177:03.97]Or the basilisks.
[177:08.01]The rangers.
[177:08.53]Doesn't it only work on... It's only melee, right?
[177:12.27]Didn't we find that out before?
[177:14.86]Hand-to-hand damage, yeah.
[177:15.64]I'm going to do it on the wyvern.
[177:19.74]Okay.
[177:22.30]And then I'm just going to fly, like, almost in there.
[177:28.15]Maybe I shouldn't do it yet.
[177:28.93]I'm not going to do it yet.
[177:31.19]I'm going to do it, like, when I'm about to attack somebody.
[177:35.73]Okay, just start moving.
[177:46.53]I just need to get over here.
[177:51.88]I'm so fucked.
[177:59.11]I'm just aiming him and shoot him.
[178:08.10]I gotta get rid of the ones that have range.
[178:10.24]You need to die.
[178:24.63]I'm in trouble.
[178:26.37]I have better units, but they can't get in because I don't have any mana.
[178:29.07]So, we might have to go back to timeline 2 here, unless I can fly in here and just cause a fucking problem.
[178:39.05]I can't... I don't have any mana to use spells.
[178:42.41]Like, I have 12 points.
[178:45.17]I can't use these.
[178:48.39]Yeah, I'm safe scumming this.
[178:53.72]I'm gonna save for comment.
[178:54.82]It's not worth it.
[178:57.23]I might eventually get in there, but it's not worth it.
[179:10.71]And I can get some more heroes, too.
[179:15.98]And then I'll make my way over to orange.
[179:17.46]Hopefully I don't get attacked by then.
[179:22.70]He's coming in right now.
[179:26.60]He's fucking right here, isn't he?
[179:28.96]Where is he?
[179:30.62]I just, like, saw his unit.
[179:34.45]Alright, give me my spell power.
[179:40.73]And I'm going to wipe out... I'm not sure it's worth taking these.
[179:51.33]And then I could buy more.
[179:52.25]Alright, back to... This guy doesn't have anything.
[180:05.57]Ten pushups for every reload.
[180:10.75]Alright.
[180:13.24]How much mana do I have?
[180:18.66]I have... 12 out of 100.
[180:21.06]Isn't there a way I can, um... One of the spells kept within... How do I, um... Isn't there a way I can replenish them?
[180:37.86]Let me just do this.
[180:40.86]There.
[180:44.46]Hold on.
[180:46.78]I gotta, like, get him out.
[180:53.52]Is that Otto?
[180:54.10]Who's barking?
[180:58.08]Who's barking?
[180:58.98]Let me see who's barking.
[181:00.04]I'll be right back.
[181:01.02]I want to go see.
[181:02.84]Seems like somebody's at the door or something.
[181:05.95]I haven't taken a break yet anyway, so let me see what's going on.
[181:07.89]I'll be right back.
[181:54.67]Thank you.
[182:22.36]so
[182:57.27]Okay, we're good.
[183:03.03]We're good.
[183:07.40]This is really good music, you're right.
[183:08.52]It's very good.
[183:10.46]Okay, so you go into town.
[183:11.50]Because you need to be, like, in the town.
[183:17.30]Inside.
[183:17.64]And then you go and visit the town.
[183:20.73]Alright, everyone's comfortable.
[183:24.61]Everyone's good.
[183:26.23]Spend a night.
[183:28.62]And then it's time to go take over Orange.
[183:35.00]Orange, in fact, is leaving.
[183:38.04]I think Orange is now unguarded.
[183:44.17]This is going to be perfect.
[183:47.41]So now let's go like this.
[183:51.58]You got everything.
[183:52.44]You got 100 spell points.
[183:53.72]Yep.
[183:55.50]Come on out of there.
[183:58.72]And let's try to get you some people next week.
[184:01.16]You have to stay in there.
[184:02.14]You... Alright, here we go.
[184:07.62]Let's save it.
[184:09.17]That's not a save.
[184:12.61]That is.
[184:16.23]This is still timeline two.
[184:21.55]I'm ready.
[184:26.93]How do I get over here without him...
[184:32.83]Hopefully he doesn't see me.
[184:34.03]Although, I could send the other guy out to take this stuff back, but I feel like I'll just get killed.
[184:39.59]Somebody will attack me and there's more stuff.
[184:51.52]Nice tan.
[184:54.98]He's down here.
[184:55.74]He's gonna get up and then straight up.
[184:57.78]It's gonna take him a while.
[185:02.81]It'll take him a while.
[185:06.66]No, he's going back down.
[185:09.86]Tan just has so much.
[185:14.49]Tan has a fucking ton of stuff.
[185:16.43]He's got like three heroes.
[185:18.91]Me and Orange have one.
[185:23.93]I think Red only has one or two.
[185:29.88]Okay.
[185:30.73]Well, we got some dwellings.
[185:32.01]I have money, so let's just at least... Let's start a secondary unit here.
[185:36.47]Okay.
[185:44.07]Where?
[185:45.93]He took the gold mine back.
[185:48.32]I think I can get this uncontested.
[185:49.76]And then he's fucked.
[185:52.84]Yep.
[185:53.40]I think he's gonna have to backtrack and come get me.
[186:12.61]Should I?
[186:12.97]Hmm.
[186:14.36]No.
[186:16.64]Should I leave everybody in the garrison?
[186:19.44]He won't be able to get through.
[186:20.56]But... No.
[186:23.04]I don't know if that's a good idea.
[186:27.34]Just scum it.
[186:27.94]It might work.
[186:31.92]Let's see.
[186:32.28]Okay.
[186:32.72]Let's see what timeline happens when I don't do that.
[186:40.18]He's coming up.
[186:43.97]Time to change capitals again.
[186:46.97]He's coming up for this one.
[186:52.13]He might not.
[186:53.15]If I can have two castles, I'll be fucking happy.
[186:59.98]He ain't got nobody in there, man.
[187:01.30]There's like not very many people in there.
[187:05.64]Give it to me.
[187:09.87]Here we go.
[187:11.27]Earthquake.
[187:16.04]Boom.
[187:17.14]I'm flying in.
[187:19.98]Should I not?
[187:20.47]How many do I have?
[187:21.89]19?
[187:22.51]No, don't fly in.
[187:23.17]I only have one ranged unit.
[187:28.21]I'm going to get closer, though.
[187:33.26]I'm going to get closer up this way.
[187:35.80]You get closer down here.
[187:41.71]Casting any dumb spells, that's fine.
[187:43.27]I'm gonna retaliate.
[187:44.17]Now you just killed, you just absolutely killed yourself.
[187:52.10]So far so good.
[187:52.76]Let's get closer.
[187:54.46]We're gonna, I'm gonna keep everybody like near the front door.
[187:57.46]Because it's gonna open.
[188:11.26]Dead?
[188:11.50]Alright, earthquake.
[188:15.42]Uh, who needs a heal?
[188:24.69]Don't do it!
[188:25.57]What are you doing?!
[188:28.95]He's like, I think I'm gonna open the door!
[188:32.55]Do you see them?
[188:33.31]I don't think I can see them over this height.
[188:41.92]I'm gonna... Not yet.
[188:48.83]If he opens the door, I'm not even gonna send them in.
[188:52.47]No, just wait.
[188:56.93]I think I'm just gonna wait.
[188:57.93]If he opens the door, just come on out.
[188:59.75]Whatever.
[189:00.43]Nobody else has range.
[189:11.94]Oh, I can go in here.
[189:13.82]You can get in.
[189:17.93]I didn't even see that.
[189:19.91]Hey, anybody out here?
[189:26.77]Fucking idiot.
[189:36.28]Alright, I'm taking this pretty uncontested.
[189:38.64]It's fairly uncontested.
[189:40.22]I'm okay with this.
[189:45.48]Anybody hear a noise?
[189:47.72]Well, now I can go in the front door.
[189:52.22]I'm sitting on the gate.
[189:53.20]Alright, it's time.
[189:56.78]Fly in.
[190:03.03]Everybody go in.
[190:08.41]Now we just have to kill the skeletons.
[190:12.97]Uh, yeah.
[190:13.67]Now we kill the skeletons.
[190:16.43]Orange is about to be in very, very bad place.
[190:23.16]Defeated.
[190:23.58]Tons of experience.
[190:25.40]I only lost some archers and one... Yeah, I didn't lose very much.
[190:30.68]Basic Ballistics.
[190:32.80]Or Expert First Aid.
[190:38.68]I feel like I want to take Expert First Aid just to get it out of here.
[190:49.48]It's been something to pick.
[190:52.92]I feel like we can get better options.
[191:04.07]So this is what Orange has left.
[191:06.57]What does your house look like?
[191:10.05]It's pretty stacked, actually.
[191:11.97]Yeah, it's stacked.
[191:16.88]Wall of Knowledge?
[191:19.06]Yeah.
[191:22.38]Oh, look at this.
[191:22.94]He's got fucking units to spend.
[191:24.90]Alright, now we can make another hero and I can actually have them with a good army.
[191:32.12]I got another castle.
[191:34.38]It's protected.
[191:37.14]Just get in here.
[191:38.22]Get inside the castle.
[191:47.55]I also have this, which is starting to be... I'm having a little bit of trouble.
[191:52.86]But I've got an okay defense here.
[191:55.19]Not good, not great, not fantastic, bad.
[191:58.31]Not good at all.
[191:59.77]And here he comes.
[192:02.05]But it's not that good.
[192:04.29]It's good enough.
[192:06.23]He's got lots of, like, fucking bone dragon things.
[192:12.80]I just, I need him to turn around, or I need him to go, like, somewhere else.
[192:16.88]Orange is right here.
[192:19.49]Please.
[192:21.09]Go fight Orange.
[192:22.93]And kill him.
[192:24.55]But I could go kill him.
[192:25.61]No.
[192:29.05]He needs to go here.
[192:30.11]They need to fight.
[192:35.54]Now I can start to claim this shit.
[192:37.34]Wait, do I have any walking points left?
[192:43.80]Not enough to do that.
[192:47.72]Not enough.
[192:53.01]Okay, here we go.
[192:54.25]Don't come get me.
[192:58.23]Oh, where's it going?
[193:02.83]Orange.
[193:03.37]Okay.
[193:04.26]Give me this.
[193:04.68]Give me this.
[193:08.72]Give me that.
[193:27.76]I need more money.
[193:30.94]I got... How many marketplaces do I have?
[193:47.22]I got tons of wood, too.
[193:48.24]I need more shit.
[193:53.84]I do.
[193:54.16]I have to.
[193:56.74]I'm gonna do 150 of these.
[193:59.78]And then, like, 100 of these.
[194:05.63]160?
[194:05.65]180?
[194:05.73]I need units.
[194:11.21]I just need more.
[194:16.40]And then I'm gonna have a hero there, too.
[194:17.84]Alright, so, I need... I just need units.
[194:21.70]Bang.
[194:22.61]This is a- this is a decent army, okay?
[194:25.23]This is a good- this is a decent fucking army to defend this house.
[194:30.98]It's not great, but it's not terrible.
[194:51.99]I wish I had teleport.
[194:53.09]God damn, I wish I had teleport.
[194:54.78]So bad.
[194:58.06]If only I had teleport.
[194:59.34]Imagine if I had teleport.
[195:01.38]I could get one, two.
[195:03.72]I could get them all.
[195:10.02]It's up and to the right.
[195:11.34]Okay.
[195:14.92]Where am I at?
[195:16.40]I want to... Get...
[195:22.98]I could kill him.
[195:24.80]I think I'm gonna go for it.
[195:28.86]He's got no where to retreat to.
[195:29.84]I'm gonna think I'm gonna kill him.
[195:33.76]I'll get his artifacts.
[195:39.30]An orange is dead.
[195:42.28]How far away is the tan?
[195:46.91]Tan's right here.
[195:53.11]Alright, I'm gonna sit in my hole.
[195:55.75]They might actually fight.
[195:57.53]I'm hiding.
[196:01.93]It's time to hide with my two castles and my two armies.
[196:08.24]Tan.
[196:10.70]Claiming tan.
[196:13.12]Orange is coming back here.
[196:15.20]Orange is on the way back here.
[196:18.02]He has to claim a castle.
[196:20.22]He's done.
[196:33.55]Remember, he only has a few days left.
[196:40.67]Anything else I can do up here?
[196:41.77]No, I want to save the money.
[196:49.08]I mean, okay, here's a game plan.
[196:50.72]I could send you out and then make a new hero and start stacking.
[196:58.60]I think that is a ding.
[197:03.10]No!
[197:06.20]Bad plan?
[197:06.94]Do you think that's a good plan?
[197:09.08]I already have a new cap- I already have a capital.
[197:22.01]I could get- how many titans could I get?
[197:25.01]One.
[197:26.43]I could get one super titan.
[197:29.69]And replace the medusa.
[197:35.34]I need to restart my computer.
[197:36.98]What?
[197:40.65]I have the other guy's stack units and the other... Should I... Save the game.
[197:53.56]This is... I'll tell you.
[197:55.18]This is crucial.
[197:58.12]Because I'm in a spot right now where I can start to stockpile minions and I can eliminate another player.
[198:04.09]And then, again, another week goes by and I've got, like, a couple of really decent-sized armies.
[198:10.37]This is crucial that this decision is done correctly.
[198:17.16]I have to go... I have to go this way and start to claim territories that Tan has over here.
[198:28.66]Once Orange is done, I need to go this way, and I have to start going over here.
[198:36.95]There's no way I'm going to be able to take over Tan.
[198:39.46]Not right now.
[198:40.06]I need a few more castles, and I need a little bit more of a minion stash.
[198:45.98]This is crucial.
[198:46.93]Let's go.
[198:56.64]This is his last ditch effort.
[198:57.62]I'm going to get his artifacts.
[198:58.80]It's over.
[198:59.26]He loses.
[198:59.64]What does he have?
[199:06.05]Queens.
[199:06.53]Let's get a little bit of ranged.
[199:09.69]I'm going to... Let's see.
[199:11.59]Fireball or... I'm going to get rid of the ranged.
[199:23.67]So we can do right here, or right here.
[199:25.87]I can do right there.
[199:26.59]That'll take out probably most of the stuff over this way.
[199:36.74]Do earthquake on my own house?
[199:39.18]That would be so... No, I'm not gonna do earthquake!
[199:45.42]I could do slow.
[199:50.17]Always slow.
[199:55.63]Reduce the speed of all enemy units.
[200:01.04]Okay.
[200:04.94]I'm gonna stick around.
[200:05.80]I'm just gonna wait.
[200:08.52]Nobody move.
[200:09.00]I have some range.
[200:11.34]Let them come to you.
[200:12.04]Nobody move.
[200:13.80]Nobody do anything.
[200:14.34]Alright.
[200:22.09]Take out the wizard.
[200:28.70]Let them explode.
[200:29.64]You get to go twice, that's fine.
[200:35.09]One queen has perished.
[200:40.26]Jewel wizardry.
[200:41.32]It really is jewel wizardry.
[200:45.37]Alright, who am I?
[200:51.59]Oh, here.
[200:52.89]I can do that every time.
[200:55.95]Ten gargoyles perish.
[200:58.09]Thank god you're stupid.
[201:00.96]Alright, just don't do anything.
[201:02.72]Don't move.
[201:04.06]Nobody move!
[201:05.62]They have to come to you.
[201:09.06]No!
[201:16.02]They got the bottom down.
[201:16.94]That was a mistake.
[201:21.79]Seven genies dead.
[201:23.75]What?
[201:25.35]What are you thinking?
[201:26.01]What the fuck even are you thinking?
[201:47.12]16.
[201:47.18]He's dead.
[201:47.68]I get to go again.
[201:48.74]Let's make it a double.
[201:51.98]Minimal damage.
[201:52.92]Minimal.
[201:53.60]Minimal.
[201:55.78]Okay.
[201:56.18]Looking good.
[201:57.30]He's through.
[201:57.78]That's fine.
[201:58.46]He's dead.
[202:01.60]Are they... Did he... How did he... Oh, he flew.
[202:05.12]Okay.
[202:11.17]Twice.
[202:11.61]Nice.
[202:13.59]He's fucked.
[202:19.27]I wonder if you're gonna step on a landmine.
[202:21.05]What do you think?
[202:26.86]Rush him?
[202:27.48]No, not yet.
[202:27.94]Not yet.
[202:28.32]Not until these guys are dead.
[202:33.36]If I can not take any damage from, like, any of these people, that would be so happy.
[202:39.34]See, look, he just, like, got...
[202:48.90]What the fuck are you doing?
[202:54.20]Why would you do that?
[202:55.78]That was just BM, it was.
[203:01.45]He knew he was gonna lose.
[203:15.28]Don't let him come in!
[203:16.40]Who cares?
[203:16.94]They're not gonna get in.
[203:25.95]Just go for the front, I guess.
[203:27.09]Why not?
[203:28.09]I'm actually gonna go for the main keys.
[203:34.36]He has to go all the way down.
[203:35.26]Oh no, oh no, you punched me a couple times.
[203:40.28]I'm scared.
[203:48.24]I'm scared!
[204:00.56]Give me all your stuff.
[204:05.32]Oh, I'm scared.
[204:09.36]Don't, Shepard, be quiet.
[204:10.06]Hold on.
[204:19.87]Wearing this item renders your units immune to the curse spell.
[204:22.85]That's pretty great.
[204:27.90]1 on the torso.
[204:28.44]This item increases your power by plus 2.
[204:31.60]And the Crest of Valor increases your morale by plus 1.
[204:35.90]Advanced Ballistics.
[204:38.46]Hey guys, I'm gonna have low energy.
[204:43.30]Yeah.
[204:44.10]Oh, look at that.
[204:54.87]No!
[204:57.40]The fuck!
[204:59.40]Get the fuck out of my land.
[205:04.63]I did that.
[205:05.41]I vanquished the enemy.
[205:07.45]These streams are really weird.
[205:16.79]Don't fake cry, that made me sad.
[205:20.63]Why?
[205:20.85]Because I systematically destroyed him.
[205:24.41]I meticulously destroyed him.
[205:29.22]I was the one that killed Orange.
[205:30.78]Nobody else did anything to him.
[205:31.96]I took out his ground units.
[205:34.02]I took out his cemented into the ground units, which are castles.
[205:38.46]He had no chance.
[205:41.50]I'm okay with this.
[205:48.33]Let me make sure I have all this stuff equipped.
[205:49.77]I do, right?
[205:57.40]Power's pretty good.
[206:02.87]You're going... Alright, I just hurt myself.
[206:06.27]I just, like... I can't even describe what I just did.
[206:08.97]I just, like, closed my legs tightly around and, like, spun around and... That hurt a lot.
[206:15.18]Alright.
[206:17.08]We're almost at a new week.
[206:19.20]I've got... time now.
[206:23.62]I have enough time to send... you packing.
[206:30.06]Out here.
[206:31.24]I'm going to go up to red.
[206:34.78]I'm going to try to find my way this way.
[206:37.14]I'm not going to leave this place empty handed because I'm going to make another hero and I'm going to make this castle defending.
[206:45.45]Check it out.
[206:48.97]Alright.
[206:49.79]Which like YouTube thumbnail am I going to use?
[206:52.99]Which YouTuber click this video thumbnail?
[207:03.80]They're both equally... Ooh, level four barbarian!
[207:11.39]Specialty in ogres.
[207:20.07]Yeah, alright.
[207:20.71]Should I be... the YouTuber put my face on every thumbnail, or... every iPad game that has released in the last three years?
[207:33.80]This is an important decision.
[207:41.27]I think we have to go with the U, too.
[207:48.62]Yeah, well, I gotta move on up.
[207:51.26]I gotta, like, move this person out of the way.
[207:57.32]He's level 4, too.
[207:58.36]I mean, I have to.
[207:59.00]He's level 4.
[208:00.92]Bingo.
[208:03.11]Alright, let's get you some people.
[208:06.51]How about some Titans?
[208:09.61]We're gonna build you up.
[208:10.97]I'm gonna take this person out of here.
[208:14.55]Alright, everything's just fine.
[208:16.39]We're starting to become a power.
[208:18.99]Tan is looking very strong.
[208:21.16]Red's looking a little on the weak side, I think.
[208:27.78]I'm gonna take you...
[208:32.61]Oh, you're in town.
[208:34.63]You know what?
[208:37.20]What?
[208:37.30]Okay.
[208:38.20]Everything's claimed.
[208:39.00]I'm gonna leave that castle protected.
[208:41.50]Come over here and get this mine.
[208:42.60]Is anybody in here?
[208:46.45]He's fucking deluded.
[208:53.14]Hey, I'm making it to, like, the final three.
[208:55.68]I'm okay with that.
[208:56.42]Tan is a lot of stuff, but if I can... If Tan does not end up coming up here immediately, it's going to be hard for him to take this castle.
[209:11.09]I wonder if I should just fuck it and just start moving.
[209:13.01]I'm going to have to move.
[209:17.09]I'm going to get this.
[209:18.47]I mean, that's just money.
[209:19.33]I need it.
[209:25.65]tan tan's got everything it's it's gonna be this is gonna be red red's gone orange gone red gone I think I don't know if the hose left it's just gray green and tan I think no it is just me
[209:55.42]Oh, fuck.
[209:56.12]It's just me versus Tan?
[209:57.80]No!
[210:05.27]No, is it really me and Tan?
[210:11.37]No, no, no, this still pink?
[210:18.86]Red, dead.
[210:21.54]Tan?
[210:26.43]Pink was the first to die.
[210:27.69]Well, yeah, Pink died in the very beginning.
[210:32.41]Is it just me and Tan?
[210:36.91]Did Blue die?
[210:37.65]We're gonna have to investigate over here.
[210:44.72]It's investigation time.
[210:46.74]I need to go this way.
[210:47.66]There's somebody in here.
[210:48.44]Yeah, we gotta... I'm investigating.
[210:58.84]Hand's coming up.
[211:01.53]Is it nobody left?
[211:05.55]Well, get this back.
[211:07.79]Get the thousand experience.
[211:14.29]And let's break through this and go on the road.
[211:24.86]Not a new week yet.
[211:32.15]No, what do we need?
[211:32.87]I need genies.
[211:34.08]Okay.
[211:43.80]I'm really, really confused about this.
[211:45.85]Let's see.
[211:48.23]Han's got this all under control.
[211:51.71]Here he comes.
[211:52.19]He's on this road down here.
[211:57.60]He's going to go this way.
[212:02.37]Alright, find out what's over here.
[212:06.99]Anybody else in the chat smoke weed?
[212:10.05]Alright, well I just killed that guy in a second.
[212:20.21]What's over here?
[212:20.93]Nothing?
[212:22.51]It's not a road.
[212:25.73]Dwarf College.
[212:38.07]Where's he heading?
[212:42.75]No, I don't know.
[212:43.57]He's freaking me out.
[212:45.67]They just met in the middle there.
[212:46.77]He's coming.
[212:47.33]No, he went down again.
[212:48.15]I don't mind any dwarves, no.
[212:51.76]What the fuck is that?
[212:56.24]I've made it across.
[212:57.32]Homestead.
[212:59.14]Archers, no.
[212:59.76]Is this all tan?
[213:23.63]Who left these here?
[213:24.86]He won't make it.
[213:53.68]Get in.
[213:55.06]One hit.
[213:55.90]Nice.
[213:58.40]Okay, so now we've got a bubbling cauldron.
[214:05.49]Where am I?
[214:09.19]And where is Tan?
[214:14.76]Is he on this road?
[214:15.54]No, not yet.
[214:17.54]Alright, we've got more defense here.
[214:21.62]More of these.
[214:26.51]stacking up some units this one's the one that's in the most danger I think they're ignoring it over here tan he's going down to get elementals thousand experience give me a fountain of youth
[214:59.70]Okay, got morale.
[215:02.48]Can't tell what's up there.
[215:03.28]I'm going back to the road.
[215:05.84]Oh, what's this?
[215:08.17]Mage tower.
[215:10.49]Just mages.
[215:17.67]Uncharted territory I need to save.
[215:24.77]No, um... I have to.
[215:33.07]Some of these wyverns.
[215:36.21]More donkeys.
[215:38.03]Archers.
[215:42.28]I'm fucking nervous right now.
[215:43.66]He's got two really, really stacked heroes.
[215:47.66]He might even have three.
[215:53.30]Enchanted Spring.
[215:55.30]Water Wheel.
[215:55.88]Enchanted Spring.
[215:58.08]Pegasi.
[215:58.76]I don't want any Pegasi.
[216:03.66]Sanctuary.
[216:10.54]Fuck.
[216:18.45]You don't have a castle over here?
[216:20.49]You got this one.
[216:24.81]You've got to have a castle back here, stuck back here.
[216:27.52]You have to.
[216:28.04]Get in the sanctuary.
[216:34.05]There's got to be a castle back there.
[216:36.77]There has to be a stuffed crust castle back there.
[216:39.84]Oh, don't say that.
[216:46.24]I can't eat that.
[216:48.72]I can't eat any food for like the next two or three days.
[217:00.66]This is pretty barren here.
[217:02.00]I have Titans.
[217:05.69]He's coming up.
[217:08.52]No, he's just claiming every resource.
[217:10.20]He's gonna have- He has so much money.
[217:11.62]He's got so many resources.
[217:12.94]I'm fucking- Look at this!
[217:14.68]He's got the whole map!
[217:18.96]It's just me and Tan.
[217:20.12]It has to be.
[217:27.37]I gotta snipe some of these resources from him.
[217:31.33]It's so far away.
[217:43.80]That's plus one attack.
[217:45.06]Okay, I've got all I can buy.
[217:54.39]I gotta go back to the other place.
[217:59.04]This is... I'm okay with this defense.
[218:00.76]I can't do any more Titans.
[218:05.22]I can do Naga Queens.
[218:06.24]I can do one.
[218:14.15]This is it.
[218:16.39]He's coming in for the kill.
[218:17.45]He's coming in for the kill shot right now.
[218:20.53]There better be something right at the end of this road.
[218:23.07]He's coming for the kill shot.
[218:23.99]He's right here.
[218:30.52]Let's just check.
[218:31.14]Let's see what's at the end of the road.
[218:50.59]Fuck!
[218:51.07]It's right here!
[218:52.29]I'm gonna get it!
[218:52.91]That would've been too far away.
[219:02.99]Um... I think I aban- we abandoned this castle, I think.
[219:07.30]I'm gonna get- I'm gonna get another titan.
[219:10.04]Do I abandon the castle?
[219:14.66]Should I, like, hide over here and then run away?
[219:18.41]I could take all these units out of here and like run the fuck away.
[219:37.94]What do I got for resources?
[219:52.87]Time to kneel.
[219:59.19]I'm not kneeling.
[220:01.57]I don't kneel for kings I don't believe in.
[220:03.37]I got 10,000.
[220:07.49]I can get two more titans.
[220:22.20]I think I'm gonna get him out of here.
[220:23.22]I'm gonna have, like, somebody sneak out the back.
[220:28.08]Eight titans.
[220:29.32]Those are very damaging.
[220:30.62]Look at this.
[220:31.06]The fucking 40 to 60 damage ranged.
[220:44.37]Stay in the fort.
[220:45.31]Just stay in here.
[220:52.37]Do not sneak out the back.
[220:53.63]Make him pay in blood.
[220:58.73]Do you think I can win with eight titans just throwing lightning bolts?
[221:01.71]I don't know if I can do that.
[221:06.20]I think I take... Here's my plan, okay?
[221:08.28]Let me tell you my plan.
[221:09.56]I think I take... The titans.
[221:13.86]And I fucking run them away.
[221:16.77]This is like $80,000 worth of stuff.
[221:19.31]I'm gonna run them... I'm getting out...
[221:22.29]I can get outta here!
[221:27.65]You're gonna give him the titans?
[221:28.99]No, no, hold on, let me, let's, just hear me out on this, just wait.
[221:32.73]He's right there.
[221:37.37]Fuck.
[221:39.19]If he was like, over here, I would've just like, ran through the gate.
[221:44.41]Oh well.
[221:48.28]Just gonna defend.
[221:50.93]Uh, I might actually sell some resources to get some more mages.
[221:57.17]He's coming with like a gigantic fucking force too.
[221:59.68]This is so bad.
[222:26.34]These guys aren't even, like, leveled up.
[222:28.90]I can get some of them.
[222:30.96]Well, at least I have more range.
[222:36.03]Okay.
[222:38.27]Save the game.
[222:40.05]This is timeline two, which is still in it.
[222:45.00]I'm about to go up to his castle up here.
[222:46.80]Maybe he sees, maybe he can see that, and he's like, wait a minute.
[222:49.94]That's not a good idea, and he pulls back.
[223:00.02]Split up the titans?
[223:00.72]Should I do, like, 2, 4, 6, 8?
[223:02.80]Should I do... Or, like, 4 and 4?
[223:07.65]2, 4, 6, 8?
[223:12.57]No.
[223:16.49]Keep them together.
[223:20.29]No, no.
[223:20.83]Okay, alright.
[223:21.41]I'm just thinking maybe that would be a new thing to do.
[223:24.97]I could send out, like, an envoy to meet him with, like, four fucking orcs.
[223:35.75]Let him come.
[223:39.91]This is it.
[223:41.29]He fucking ran away.
[223:43.60]He ran away, he didn't fight me.
[223:45.84]And now I'm gonna get his castle.
[223:50.96]Oh, you have a lot of people in here.
[223:54.08]You've got a few, a horde, lots of throng, lots of throng.
[224:00.19]This ain't gonna happen.
[224:09.15]Okay.
[224:26.82]Earthquake!
[224:30.14]Here we go.
[224:31.44]Catapult.
[224:33.12]Catapult right here.
[224:40.18]Right there.
[224:42.04]And that's not where I aimed.
[224:43.80]Alright, I gotta play this smart.
[224:51.62]I aimed, like, right here.
[224:53.10]Why did it go down here?
[224:58.88]Chaos Hydras.
[225:01.66]I'm going in.
[225:02.42]I just have to go in and try.
[225:03.50]Oh, it can miss.
[225:11.07]Everybody just has to try to get in here and kill the Hydra as fast as possible, and then everything else should not be too horrible.
[225:23.81]Poison.
[225:28.83]Had to try.
[225:30.85]I gotta- I have to get the fuck in here.
[225:36.99]Ah, what's more favorable?
[225:39.47]Probably versus the Fireflies.
[225:44.60]Archers?
[225:45.98]I can't really get over there.
[225:51.56]I could fly over here.
[225:54.79]Just, like, wait.
[226:05.35]Good.
[226:17.07]Let me go away.
[226:17.43]I'm gonna keep aiming it down here.
[226:28.13]The bull.
[226:28.97]I mean, I'm just gonna try to get the bottom.
[226:37.57]If I go for it here, the fucking Hydra. 250.
[226:54.11]Get to go again.
[226:54.83]Take another one down.
[227:07.14]Open the front door.
[227:08.96]What are you thinking?
[227:10.28]Oh my god, that's so good.
[227:15.03]Come on, if I get this castle, I'm back in the game for real.
[227:17.19]And it's very possible.
[227:18.55]Alright, I can do Earthquake again, or I can do something else.
[227:29.24]But before I do Earthquake, let me see if this breaks.
[227:33.60]If this breaks, then I don't need to do Earthquake.
[227:40.38]Don't need to do Earthquake, I'm in.
[227:47.30]Now, I'm gonna do something else.
[227:49.54]I'm gonna do either Fireball or Lightning Bolt.
[227:54.01]Fireball on... Now it hits me too, doesn't it?
[228:03.30]And what we can do, we have expert, right?
[228:05.90]Expert stone skin?
[228:06.92]That's not a good, that's not a bad idea.
[228:08.56]Do I have it, though?
[228:10.32]Let's do it.
[228:13.75]Alright.
[228:15.41]Continue to destroy.
[228:16.57]I want you archers.
[228:24.05]The bulls.
[228:25.57]Holy fucking hell, the bulls.
[228:28.40]The bulls, the bulls.
[228:33.29]I'm gonna get it.
[228:34.95]I'm gonna get this.
[228:49.94]God, they're so powerful.
[228:52.05]They're so powerful.
[228:55.69]They're like too powerful.
[228:58.67]Let's keep killing these guys down.
[229:04.14]Heal both Alright, that's good Gnoll's dead
[229:34.41]That's it.
[229:38.15]I got way more than you.
[229:47.82]This is a victory.
[229:51.75]I'm gonna lose the archers, but... It's okay.
[230:02.16]The bow might be the best unit that I have.
[230:04.04]I'm just gonna stack them forever.
[230:09.31]Uh, can I?
[230:10.37]Really?
[230:10.61]I can hit that guy?
[230:11.97]No, I can't.
[230:15.34]Oh, you can.
[230:16.64]That's funny.
[230:17.12]Alright, get in here.
[230:37.03]These ones are still up here.
[230:40.23]No, it's alright, just wait.
[230:42.43]Get the balls in here.
[230:44.11]What the heck?
[230:44.43]What the hell?
[230:44.93]No, what the fuck is going on?
[230:45.95]I can't believe it!
[230:46.69]I knew that was gonna happen, don't worry.
[230:49.36]Oh, I hate this game!
[230:51.30]I tried to click him!
[230:52.38]The game's fun.
[231:00.38]I just took his capital.
[231:08.16]Normal maximum spell points by 50%.
[231:09.86]That's insane.
[231:16.70]Or Expert Ballistics.
[231:20.78]Two aim shots at maximum damage.
[231:23.53]Either one of these is really, really good.
[231:38.22]Here's the capital.
[231:38.80]I need bulls.
[231:46.41]Alright, what do you got?
[231:47.91]You've already cleaned yourself out completely here.
[231:49.95]I mean, I can get all of these.
[231:51.77]Might as well, just because I'm running out of people.
[231:59.63]Don't have an artifact.
[232:00.43]I gotta make an artifact merchant.
[232:02.67]So I got three cities.
[232:06.50]And now that I have this, I can start to move around a little bit.
[232:10.09]Is it really just me and Tan?
[232:11.43]I'm so fucked.
[232:15.75]This is not a bad force.
[232:19.51]I gotta come out and start claiming stuff.
[232:24.20]I can come out.
[232:25.38]This person's not scary at all.
[232:29.72]You know what I mean?
[232:31.02]I'm pretty sure I can take that person.
[232:41.10]What do you got?
[232:41.97]This is the one that has the power.
[232:45.29]He has the swarm of the pixies.
[232:47.19]He has the highest unit.
[232:50.41]I think he has three heroes.
[232:51.43]I could snipe some more of these castles.
[232:57.24]That's exactly what I'm gonna fucking do.
[232:59.60]Not that one.
[233:01.50]I'm gonna go down here.
[233:03.48]See, there we go.
[233:04.16]Right here.
[233:05.40]You've got like a pack.
[233:06.42]You've got feet.
[233:09.06]That would be a fight.
[233:12.73]Here comes a new week.
[233:27.91]Alright, 8900.
[233:32.26]More chaos hydrants.
[233:33.80]More bulls.
[233:34.64]Get them all.
[233:41.31]This is turning out to be a pretty good army.
[233:42.65]Alright, I need to leave here and start claiming.
[233:46.01]I gotta... I gotta start picking stuff up.
[233:54.93]You know, I gotta start to tap into his resources.
[233:59.64]At least come out and grab some of the stuff that he took before.
[234:02.04]Let's get too far though.
[234:05.94]I need to start to...
[234:14.16]Yeah, I lost my swamp.
[234:20.68]I could start to come out and go on the open field here.
[234:22.84]I have pretty decent army.
[234:26.37]Who's this guy?
[234:27.05]This guy that just came in the front door.
[234:30.39]Who are you?
[234:33.13]Several.
[234:34.07]Horde.
[234:34.83]Several.
[234:35.41]This is gonna be a fight.
[234:46.35]I got fucking six Chaos Dragons.
[234:53.73]I can repel them.
[235:03.59]10, 18, 54, 6.
[235:04.17]I could sell resources, but I don't know if he's going to come do it.
[235:16.39]Several means, what, 5 to 10?
[235:18.51]Or is it 10 to 20?
[235:21.29]A few is like up to 5, right?
[235:23.13]Up to 10.
[235:23.53]5 to 9.
[235:32.63]It's gonna be a fight, but I have to... I think I might... I'll be able to do it.
[235:39.63]Oh, fuck.
[235:40.45]They're closing in.
[235:42.29]Hold on a minute here.
[235:43.11]What do I got in here?
[235:46.75]I think I... I got eight titans.
[235:48.79]I think I meet him in the open field.
[235:49.97]I think I can do it.
[236:03.24]Two more titans.
[236:04.56]I gotta load that guy up with titans.
[236:09.63]Alright, I'm gonna start to claim.
[236:10.89]I gotta start to move around.
[236:15.52]I haven't been down here.
[236:16.20]There might be another castle.
[236:17.26]We might not even be fortified.
[236:24.60]Well, time to save.
[236:25.50]This is where we find out what might happen here.
[236:30.20]Let's see what happens.
[236:36.93]No, he's not coming.
[236:39.51]We just want the resources!
[236:50.88]Ice Bolt, Ice Bolt, Ice Bolt, Ice Bolt, Ice Bolt.
[236:55.36]You don't have Ice Bolt!
[236:56.46]How do you not have Ice Bolt?
[236:57.75]You should do.
[236:58.71]Ice Bolt on the bird.
[237:02.29]Three?
[237:02.65]Here we go.
[237:09.35]Oh, it's all right.
[237:11.17]It's gonna happen.
[237:12.45]They have a lot of ranged.
[237:17.75]They have a lot of range.
[237:19.57]Do I fly out and fucking attack the genie?
[237:21.81]I could go fly attack this genie right now.
[237:23.43]Or I might just focus on the bird.
[237:28.19]Bird focus.
[237:36.00]Come on.
[237:38.00]Ow.
[237:39.22]Kill bird.
[237:40.86]Kill bird.
[237:44.24]He's got one left.
[237:46.90]Ow.
[237:49.23]Kill bird!
[237:51.07]Kill bird!
[237:54.47]I have a really good chance now.
[237:56.87]Now everybody just fucking relax and hang out and don't do anything dumb.
[238:04.92]I've got bowls.
[238:06.12]I do.
[238:13.29]All right.
[238:14.57]The most important... These guys don't have range.
[238:17.54]No, they do.
[238:18.96]They do.
[238:20.42]You split the titans up.
[238:22.96]These wizards are the ones that have to die.
[238:24.70]Fuck.
[238:29.59]I gotta get out there.
[238:30.91]I gotta... I have to get out there.
[238:31.97]I gotta fly out there.
[238:32.63]I gotta kill those wizards.
[238:33.31]I gotta get out there now.
[238:37.11]You know, I gotta get... I gotta get... I gotta get... I have to get out there.
[238:45.43]331?
[238:45.45]Oh my god.
[238:51.35]Alright, I think I- I have to.
[238:53.27]Let me- wait, lightning bolt, ice bolt, ice bolt, ice or lightning?
[238:57.33]Versus, uh, the wizards.
[239:00.75]Probably lightning.
[239:02.63]I could blind him too.
[239:08.53]Cannot move and cause it to counterattack at half its normal attack strength.
[239:13.65]No, that doesn't- he can still attack.
[239:18.34]No, blind ain't gonna work.
[239:19.24]We're gonna do... we're gonna zap.
[239:36.73]I... I'm... I got... do I just fucking go out there?
[239:46.81]I don't know.
[239:47.35]I think they just have to wait.
[239:49.66]Oh, I can hold it or just go in.
[239:53.62]That's the only range they have.
[239:58.24]I'm going in!
[240:15.73]I've gotta do this, I have to fly over there and kill!
[240:17.98]I- I- ugh... 58!
[240:31.87]Oh no!
[240:33.19]It's like... They have too many units!
[240:44.78]There's too many units.
[240:46.40]You've got fucking 400 of these things.
[240:49.60]Send the balls in.
[240:57.53]Just somebody kill these.
[240:59.71]The titans can't even move.
[241:03.71]I'm going out the front door with the balls next fucking attempt.
[241:17.21]They're dead.
[241:18.51]Dead.
[241:18.91]Come on, kill them.
[241:25.14]No, you're doing this stupid blessing.
[241:28.08]Get these pixies out of here.
[241:30.40]Okay.
[241:37.83]Should I dispel?
[241:38.69]Or should I try Ice Bolt?
[241:42.87]I can't.
[241:45.43]I'm gonna dispel him.
[241:46.43]I can't.
[241:48.40]Blind.
[241:49.88]I can't.
[241:50.24]I don't have enough spell points.
[242:01.37]God damn it.
[242:08.47]God damn it!
[242:11.63]Why was this guy so beefy?
[242:14.87]That's the only person that's been doing anything.
[242:18.00]It's cause this hero, like, is level 2.
[242:19.48]They realistically only have this.
[242:32.09]I still have 18 bulls, and I still have chaos fucking demons.
[242:45.41]I kinda have to just walk out the fucking front door.
[242:49.56]Like, that's the sad part of this.
[242:50.76]I have to get out there.
[242:51.78]Like, just go.
[242:52.12]Just go out the front door.
[243:09.49]Get the balls out there.
[243:10.67]Hurry!
[243:11.05]Alright, he brought the genies in.
[243:16.45]Eighteen.
[243:17.47]Three genies die.
[243:21.15]I have to bring the balls out.
[243:22.31]Or should I just kill the genies?
[243:24.97]They're just... They're in here.
[243:29.55]Five genies dead.
[243:30.55]No.
[243:31.01]They have too many of these guys.
[243:31.99]They have too many.
[243:37.42]They had so much range.
[243:38.54]He just brought... He had like fucking four ranged units.
[243:47.42]This is it.
[243:47.82]I lose.
[243:54.04]Well, this person's literally just stepping in the swamp.
[244:01.19]I should have... 20-20 hindsight, I should have only just... I should have brought everybody outside to attack the mages.
[244:06.73]But then they would have just died.
[244:08.95]They would have just died.
[244:13.52]Everybody that walked out the door would just die.
[244:17.94]Yeah, this is a loss.
[244:19.70]The balls can't do this on their own.
[244:23.00]I love how the shitty archers on the castle can do more damage than, like, my people can do.
[244:33.06]Yeah, this is over.
[244:36.48]They are weakened, yeah, but... I've lost this ca- I'm just- they have- Tann owns almost the entire game.
[244:42.88]I mean, I'm just gonna fucking- whatever.
[244:47.54]I'm just gonna die here.
[244:59.70]Why would you do that?
[245:10.79]Well... They ain't gonna have... At this stage, I don't know.
[245:21.66]I don't think this is winnable.
[245:23.42]I don't... They have so much beef.
[245:25.46]They own the whole game!
[245:30.96]I swear to God, if pink is just down here... No, it's all tan.
[245:35.12]They conquered everything.
[245:38.60]Tan conquered... Okay, this is the stupidest damn thing.
[245:41.74]Listen to what happened here.
[245:43.72]So... One of these... Two or three of these fucking dumb fuckfaces in the beginning of the game, like pink and blue, whoever it was, instantly lost.
[245:53.33]And I mean like instantly.
[245:55.09]They lost everything.
[245:56.47]Tan just like walked into somebody's castle and just took it over.
[246:00.33]Twice.
[246:09.26]And then, so Tan at the very beginning of the game had like three castles down here.
[246:16.67]And then just started to fucking poison everybody and then I made it to the finals too.
[246:20.69]I'm okay with this.
[246:22.41]Who's even in here?
[246:23.91]What's down here?
[246:24.43]I want to see what's down here.
[246:31.04]Get out of my way.
[246:34.40]This goddamn Tan.
[246:36.50]Yeah, it's just me and Tan.
[246:44.45]fucking tan.
[246:45.99]Unbelievable.
[246:46.81]I can't believe it.
[246:48.27]They took everything.
[246:50.49]They have everything.
[246:52.88]No.
[246:53.82]I can't lose in a 1v1.
[246:55.54]Who's in here?
[246:56.14]Where's the ice pool?
[247:12.20]There's gotta be some castle that's unguarded.
[247:16.16]How do you have so much guard everywhere?
[247:18.02]Come on, I need money to make units.
[247:34.23]Oh my god.
[247:37.91]Yeah, from the very beginning of the game.
[247:42.02]This is impossible.
[247:42.96]This is an unsurmountable no victory.
[247:45.84]I can't do it.
[247:46.98]Impossible.
[247:48.34]I have to restart the game.
[247:49.24]I'm done.
[247:49.62]There's no way.
[247:53.56]Alright, so you know when you play Risk?
[248:01.61]and you're on Australia, still, and one of your friends has every single other continent and every single other country in the game, and he gives you that look like, uh, what do you want to do here?
[248:12.80]Because you have, like, 200 troops right at that bridge.
[248:18.96]That's just what I'm doing.
[248:20.16]I'm just prolonging the game.
[248:31.02]Hey dude, you wanna get some food or something?
[248:34.90]No.
[248:36.64]I'm not done playing the game.
[248:40.16]I mean, it's impossible for you to win.
[248:42.77]I'm not done playing.
[248:46.21]Alright.
[248:47.37]Where do you wanna go?
[248:51.51]I would like to stay in Australia.
[248:54.85]In Fortify, please.
[248:56.91]Okay.
[248:57.03]Okay.
[249:02.20]Yeah, there's just like... There's no way.
[249:06.08]I have to just give up.
[249:09.12]Go to the treehouse.
[249:10.08]Yeah, I didn't even click that.
[249:12.86]I'm just... I'm clicking it.
[249:14.60]It's like eight heroes.
[249:22.62]Oh no, they're coming from my castle!
[249:26.64]What's wrong?
[249:32.25]He owns everything.
[249:35.91]He has like ten castles.
[249:40.32]He has every single castle.
[249:45.94]What is this?
[249:46.98]Oh, that's me.
[249:48.82]That's so funny.
[249:50.76]I made it to the final two.
[249:52.20]I'll take second place.
[249:53.10]That's fine.
[249:58.67]He's just toying with me.
[250:01.82]Well, I mean, I still have, like, 10, I could just put, make, like, 20 fucking titans.
[250:11.87]It's not over yet.
[250:14.92]It has not ended.
[250:18.96]He hasn't taken this castle, and I could, I can make 20 titans.
[250:27.76]Get out of Australia.
[250:30.02]Stop it.
[250:31.86]You're not going to win.
[250:32.96]I don't care how many troops you have on Australia.
[250:36.57]Here we go!
[250:49.59]Biggest threat is... What the hell is this?
[250:55.09]They shoot 63 of these fucking things.
[251:01.95]No, the mages, I think the mages are the worst.
[251:05.59]And the ones that can fly.
[251:07.17]Oh boy.
[251:11.63]Okay, well, hold on a minute here.
[251:15.10]It's not over yet.
[251:17.68]Just continue, just buff the titan.
[251:28.68]magic arrow cure bless maximum damage I haven't lost yet
[251:58.65]Give me the Titan again.
[252:03.90]Stay here.
[252:04.26]Now I get to go again.
[252:08.58]Oh, it's been breached.
[252:17.47]Okay.
[252:18.81]We have Blessing.
[252:20.37]We're gonna do... He still has Blessing, right?
[252:27.03]I guess he's blessed, right?
[252:35.66]Just fucking keep doing it.
[252:39.31]It's very... I can do this.
[252:47.29]How many points do I have?
[252:48.99]17.
[252:49.11]I still have plenty.
[252:51.89]Stoneskin on... I'm going to say... Probably on the Naga Queens.
[252:59.59]Or just all in on the Titans.
[253:04.55]It's probably all in on title.
[253:05.93]That's what I'm gonna go for.
[253:21.11]You're in.
[253:21.55]It's okay.
[253:21.97]You're in.
[253:22.65]But it don't matter.
[253:24.98]Now we all have to focus on you.
[253:26.66]No.
[253:27.16]Get rid of them.
[253:32.86]Everybody just calm down.
[253:34.26]Just focus on the dragon that just climbed in.
[253:39.80]Pathetic.
[253:41.38]Pathetic.
[253:43.47]Absolutely pathetic.
[253:49.69]Fourteen.
[253:50.47]Titan, come on.
[253:53.73]Titans, do it.
[253:55.84]They're just dying.
[253:56.86]He's killing himself.
[253:59.66]I'm gonna hold the castle.
[254:03.06]I'm gonna hold the castle!
[254:05.02]This is melee, right?
[254:15.34]I'm gonna swing with the sword.
[254:16.42]That's technically melee.
[254:22.82]Holy shit!
[254:24.84]I killed so many.
[254:31.62]It's not over.
[254:33.50]I'm gonna win.
[254:33.92]Okay, we gotta deal with the ball coming in the front door.
[254:37.97]We got... Just everybody body block the Titan.
[254:45.45]This is gonna be the problem here.
[254:46.47]They still have... Yeah, they have so many strong units.
[254:53.03]Deal the immediate threat.
[254:57.01]It's the immediate threat right here.
[254:58.53]I get to go twice.
[255:06.70]Die!
[255:12.39]I'm gonna get to go with the Titan.
[255:13.41]We're gonna kill the Naga Queens.
[255:16.27]Ow!
[255:18.97]Um... Cure?
[255:21.81]Or Bless again?
[255:22.65]Alright, here comes a bull!
[255:31.94]It's just the Titan.
[255:39.42]Come on!
[255:40.68]Come on, I think I can do it.
[255:43.26]It's possible.
[255:45.71]Dispel that shit.
[255:58.59]Cure.
[256:02.23]Ah!
[256:18.39]It's still possible.
[256:20.59]It's still possible.
[256:21.65]They have to get over here.
[256:22.65]It's possible.
[256:26.74]Bloodlust.
[256:27.38]Again.
[256:27.62]Do it.
[256:29.18]Kill them.
[256:31.24]Okay.
[256:31.86]Alright.
[256:32.62]Here we go.
[256:34.74]I just need... I'm gonna lose.
[256:49.89]I have to kill- I have to get rid of the titans.
[256:52.59]Bless?
[256:53.99]Again?
[256:54.33]Or should I sto- but stone skin is for melee.
[256:58.83]Haste?
[257:06.76]Bless and then throw.
[257:10.68]Haste?
[257:11.04]You wanna do haste and then walk over here and smash him?
[257:20.30]No!
[257:21.16]Yes!
[257:23.12]Get rid of the shitty water serpents, but I have to get rid of a titan!
[257:30.57]Ah, they have two titans!
[257:32.75]Bless titan and then throw at this titan.
[257:36.51]Bless titan!
[257:38.45]And throw at this titan.
[257:40.75]Because he's got nine titans.
[257:42.64]I have six titans.
[257:46.39]I didn't even fucking hurt him!
[257:50.45]Just start fucking roping.
[258:16.12]Oh, I was so close.
[258:18.42]I was close.
[258:20.08]Come on, give me a miracle here.
[258:21.30]Morale down.
[258:28.08]Come on, give me a miracle.
[258:31.96]The titans resist the spell.
[258:55.11]This sucks.
[258:56.33]Because the archers are gonna kill this.
[258:59.99]I actually think I need... New plan.
[259:02.74]Oh, new plan.
[259:04.96]That's a bad plan.
[259:05.72]Doesn't matter, so... I gotta get out.
[259:13.49]I'm gonna fucking walk out and start swinging.
[259:30.46]I'm gonna go... I can't win.
[259:32.10]It's not possible.
[259:32.94]It's impossible to win.
[259:38.92]Wait, this is the same unit.
[259:40.48]So, I had three... No, it's impossible.
[259:42.50]Just... I just want to... No.
[259:48.32]No.
[259:49.04]He just took it without... It's empty.
[259:53.17]You're the beetle.
[259:55.03]This is it.
[259:55.51]I got nothing.
[259:56.13]It's over.
[259:56.51]Game over.
[259:57.37]He has every single building.
[260:24.33]He forgot about something.
[260:28.45]What?
[260:29.53]Wait, wait, wait, back it up, back up, back up.
[260:31.07]What the fuck was this?
[260:33.11]Where'd you- what?
[260:34.07]Who?
[260:34.35]How did this happen?
[260:40.34]Did he just... Did he just spend every cent?
[260:44.52]How about 550?
[260:45.68]8250?
[260:45.70]Where the fuck did you get these?
[260:49.42]This is the final stand here.
[261:11.82]He has every base and every resource.
[261:22.63]Oh, my fucking stomach.
[261:24.17]Yeah, he has every single base and every single resource.
[261:29.35]Why is this surprising to me?
[261:32.18]Don't main one hero.
[261:34.96]I tried to in the beginning.
[261:36.40]I tried to just make income.
[261:41.91]It's also something to be said, I mean, I am playing against eight people, you know?
[261:45.55]It's like, it's a lot more chaotic and crazy.
[261:47.62]It's hard to have, um, more than one or two heroes.
[261:54.25]Just add 200 titans and we're at 130%.
[261:56.53]It's true.
[262:06.45]It's really like, when you have an eight-person map and the AI, the one AI that forgets to move gets taken over immediately, and then whoever that AI is that took them over wins the game.
[262:19.73]That's kind of what happens.
[262:26.57]Alright.
[262:27.95]I can't really go anywhere, so we're just going to go like this.
[262:31.66]I'm going to step on a landmine.
[262:38.20]I'm doing teams this time.
[262:41.26]I'm putting tan on my team.
[262:45.48]I'm doing 2v2v2v2.
[262:57.14]Tan or purple?
[262:57.80]Who do you think?
[263:05.55]Look, I'm just going to bleed the other guy out.
[263:08.57]I'm going to go take all of his stuff.
[263:12.37]You want to do green and purple?
[263:13.77]Okay, that sounds good.
[263:14.56]We'll do it on a small map, too.
[263:17.64]Or... Small enough.
[263:20.74]I think that's quite unfair.
[263:33.00]At least I guess I was gonna say step foot in the castle.
[263:56.46]I was about to hit the end- I was about to hit the fucking surrender button.
[264:00.97]I can't go out like that.
[264:07.74]I made it to the last two.
[264:09.00]I'm okay with this.
[264:12.44]Everybody else got scooped up by Tan's fucking insatiable conquering whatever.
[264:18.91]Oh well.
[264:40.58]Oh, well.
[264:49.47]Human players.
[264:51.99]Eight.
[264:54.43]Computer... Oh, no, no, no.
[264:56.20]Seven.
[264:57.78]Other players.
[264:58.96]Let's do teams.
[265:00.40]Water content.
[265:01.64]Road type.
[265:02.18]They don't matter.
[265:05.30]Monster strength.
[265:06.00]I mean, what does this mean?
[265:08.63]Strong guardians.
[265:11.93]Water content, normal.
[265:16.13]On... What is this?
[265:18.48]Select single or two level map.
[265:20.92]I'm not sure I want to do that.
[265:26.14]What does that mean?
[265:29.94]Underground.
[265:30.82]No, I don't think... We're just going to do extra large.
[265:33.18]No, we're just going to do large.
[265:37.27]Two, four, six.
[265:38.37]Six players.
[265:41.27]one five not eight people we're gonna do three v three v one v one v one three on each two on each team we're just gonna do a team of two verse team of two verse team of two teams of two two v two v two v two two v two v two I'm I need to do this 130 difficulty I have to
[266:09.83]Okay, so I'm going to be green.
[266:14.69]Can I select green?
[266:17.05]Do I have to be?
[266:18.40]Wait a minute.
[266:19.90]Random map.
[266:22.42]Oh, team alignment.
[266:23.06]Okay, there we go.
[266:25.76]Team one is going to be... Who do I want?
[266:36.41]Tan or purple?
[266:41.51]Who do you think?
[266:43.29]Purple?
[266:56.30]Team 2?
[266:57.60]Blue and tan.
[266:58.96]Orange and green.
[266:59.82]I want to be green, though.
[267:04.23]Can I even pick that?
[267:05.19]Extra large.
[267:12.43]Okay.
[267:13.73]Normal, normal.
[267:17.12]Template.
[267:18.96]I have no idea what the fuck this means.
[267:20.34]Do 100% this time?
[267:24.88]You think so? 100%?
[267:41.38]I feel like with that... I feel like we were alright.
[267:45.22]I was doing okay.
[267:48.68]PPP options.
[267:50.98]Coin flip.
[267:52.23]No, I don't want to do this.
[267:56.85]100, that'll be fine.
[267:57.59]We just... We just gotta get more competent.
[268:04.52]You're not ready for 130%.
[268:05.30]Well, it's what we've been doing the whole... You were in Australia.
[268:10.90]Extra large?
[268:11.46]Oh, large.
[268:11.96]Okay.
[268:12.98]Alright, now I want to... I want to set up... I don't want to be red.
[268:16.28]Advanced options.
[268:22.60]How do I... I can't choose to be one of these other players?
[268:26.58]I guess I just have to be red.
[268:32.98]But what do I want to do?
[268:49.34]Acropolis?
[269:03.96]I've been killed twice in a row.
[269:10.05]More options.
[269:10.73]What else we got?
[269:12.37]Hill forts.
[269:12.87]I don't know what that even means.
[269:16.18]Advanced options.
[269:17.26]I want to... Random map.
[269:18.26]I want to go back to where I was just at.
[269:20.72]There we go.
[269:23.04]Large.
[269:24.12]One.
[269:24.58]Five.
[269:26.10]Team alignments.
[269:27.20]Team one.
[269:29.24]So can I do that?
[269:30.34]Will that work?
[269:30.88]Because that'll be green, right?
[269:39.04]No.
[269:41.26]Because usually there's a flag next to everybody.
[269:44.42]And I usually can just click it.
[269:52.54]No, it's because I have to... Okay, so hold on.
[269:58.03]So I have to... Human or computer players.
[270:00.75]Okay, that's strange.
[270:05.29]Alright, that's good, that's good, that's good.
[270:06.77]Normal, normal, normal.
[270:07.85]Let's do advanced options.
[270:10.42]There we go.
[270:12.28]Okay.
[270:15.08]Green and purple versus everybody else.
[270:23.26]Alignment.
[270:24.38]Yes, that's correct.
[270:28.48]Alright.
[270:29.68]Advanced options.
[270:30.62]Necropolis.
[270:33.24]What is it?
[270:33.58]What about Inferno?
[270:35.78]Nah, too hot.
[270:37.50]Dungeon?
[270:42.15]Stronghold.
[270:44.91]Fortress is what I just did.
[270:48.23]Conflux.
[270:51.49]Elemental.
[270:53.90]We'll do Necropolis.
[270:54.62]Necropolis and what do I want my teammate to be?
[271:00.67]What was Ares before?
[271:01.69]There he is.
[271:24.06]Alright.
[271:26.42]I'm ready.
[271:28.90]Let's go.
[271:33.33]Teams of two.
[271:37.57]Everything should be good to go.
[271:38.73]Oh, I gotta pick my hero.
[271:42.57]I don't care what this is.
[271:46.39]This is what it's gonna be.
[271:50.91]Begin.
[271:51.11]Begin.
[271:53.16]That's fine.
[271:55.25]Creating map.
[271:57.33]There am I. There's my friend.
[272:06.32]Necropolis.
[272:08.20]Alright, let's go.
[272:11.84]Let's get a second hero.
[272:14.98]Should I get a druid?
[272:21.22]First aid specialty or meteor shower.
[272:33.93]Well, let's have you head out here and get the gold.
[272:38.59]Sears Hut.
[272:39.95]Ooh, in my younger days I'd have done this myself, but I need your help.
[272:43.09]A friend of mine recently had a family heirloom stolen and wants to find it.
[272:47.85]Interesting.
[272:48.21]Got some money.
[272:48.55]Magic Well.
[272:48.97]Okay.
[272:49.11]Let me... Let's go back.
[272:49.97]I want another hero.
[273:17.95]Let's get another Necromancer.
[273:22.27]Let's stack you up, send you up.
[273:29.15]Will the Gremlins recruit lots of Gremlins?
[273:33.03]Let's actually get a save point here.
[273:34.67]Call this a new game.
[273:44.64]Alright, Master Gremlins!
[273:48.13]I think I already lost.
[273:51.13]Meteor Shower!
[274:03.44]Nope.
[274:24.72]Get in there skeletons, come on.
[274:30.47]Shit, I can't cast it again.
[274:31.45]Nah, I got this.
[274:35.81]Nice.
[274:55.61]49 battle results, so now I should have more skeletons, right?
[275:00.86]17.
[275:03.14]Sulphur, and then Griffin Conservatory.
[275:06.80]I don't want to attack the guards.
[275:07.80]No, I'm not going to do that right now.
[275:09.24]Let's get this.
[275:09.70]Level up.
[275:13.53]Wasn't quite a level up, that's fine.
[275:18.15]Okay.
[275:23.87]Harpies.
[275:26.65]Let's go back here and spend some money.
[275:32.09]Town Hall.
[275:33.79]Or should I... I think I'm gonna make a graveyard.
[275:35.47]I need... I need enemies.
[275:36.53]I have to start getting people.
[275:45.06]Last time I did this, when I did Town Hall, and then I... I didn't... I need units.
[276:00.27]I'm going to go with the graveyard.
[276:01.37]Let's get some... Oh, no.
[276:02.53]Let's go with wights.
[276:08.37]Wights are... Yeah, let's go with wights.
[276:16.41]And let's give those to you.
[276:19.04]Alright, what is my teammate going to do?
[276:22.34]Alright, he's collecting.
[276:24.14]He's got his second hero going out.
[276:25.84]Alright.
[276:26.76]Nice.
[276:28.16]Who do you got for heroes here?
[276:31.36]This guy and this guy.
[276:33.62]Okay, cool.
[276:37.85]I am going to grab... Who has more?
[276:40.67]I'm going to actually give you the whites.
[276:45.11]And you're going to keep going.
[276:52.14]Let's grab, what is this?
[276:53.30]A pack of mighty gorgons.
[276:54.68]Let's actually grab this.
[276:56.38]Yeah, I need the wood.
[277:00.90]Gold!
[277:01.58]A horde of imps.
[277:02.71]I don't think I can take a horde of imps right now, but I can collect this stuff.
[277:05.49]Alright, uh, graveyard.
[277:17.64]Get them made.
[277:25.03]Alright, nice work.
[277:26.75]He's just picking up some, uh, resources.
[277:29.11]Very cool.
[277:31.15]Uh, I think I can take these guys on.
[277:36.53]Horde of, uh, those little turtle enemies.
[277:39.74]What do you got?
[277:40.14]You got... I think I can do it.
[277:46.14]They're pretty weak.
[277:51.78]Uh, wait, wait, wait.
[277:52.42]Before I do that, grab this.
[277:58.40]Crypt.
[278:00.08]They want to search the graves.
[278:03.88]No, not with this guy.
[278:06.93]I'm terrified of what could happen here.
[278:08.17]Alright, let's get the resources going.
[278:12.43]But you on the other hand, I have a decent army.
[278:14.27]Let's kill him.
[278:19.08]Just in case of a fucking disaster.
[278:24.76]25, 25.
[278:24.84]Yeah, plus I've got fucking magic arrow too.
[278:28.76]Yeah, you did pretty weak.
[278:40.31]Float on over here, that's fine.
[278:54.89]Aha!
[278:55.07]I get the advantage to attack you first!
[279:01.66]In fact... Actually, yeah, dig around here.
[279:15.88]Dead.
[279:19.71]Resources.
[279:21.88]Experience.
[279:22.96]All the good stuff.
[279:23.58]I think that's all I can do.
[279:29.60]Estate.
[279:30.32]Vampires.
[279:31.14]Bring them on.
[279:41.91]I am now going to do a town hall.
[279:50.21]Wrong building.
[279:51.17]Wrong building.
[279:54.41]$1,000 a day.
[279:59.53]I've got some units here.
[280:00.97]Let's see.
[280:01.53]You... You don't have a bad selection here.
[280:04.69]I could probably kill these guys.
[280:13.49]I don't know if I could take on the mighty Gorgons, though.
[280:23.48]I'll go back and I'll give you... Oh, there's a bunch of random fucking people here.
[280:29.00]I want to give him the vampires.
[280:34.57]Make your way over this way.
[280:38.07]I can take them.
[280:43.01]13, 13.
[280:43.65]Magic arrow.
[280:44.33]I don't have a spell.
[280:45.35]It's alright.
[280:46.23]Just get out there.
[280:53.25]Make a text-to-speech of my voice.
[280:55.53]No, I've never considered that because anyone could get me to say literally anything they wanted.
[281:12.09]Retaliate, good.
[281:18.15]You watching the NBA Finals?
[281:19.91]NBA Finals?
[281:21.66]Who's in the Finals?
[281:33.39]Raptors and the Warriors.
[281:37.28]Interesting.
[281:42.02]Raptors and Warriors.
[281:49.73]I don't really know much about either one.
[281:53.61]Alright, now...
[281:56.98]The cover of darkness covers your city with a permanent shroud to all players.
[282:00.04]I could get it to Christ's Temple.
[282:03.52]Maybe I could get the Citadel.
[282:05.06]I would probably get Blacksmith or Marketplace.
[282:12.10]Start the Citadel up.
[282:13.56]Try to get through a city hall.
[282:17.74]What does a mausoleum take?
[282:19.94]Mage guild level 1.
[282:26.48]Okay, you.
[282:27.38]We're gonna come in here and take these.
[282:29.22]Okay, pretty good.
[282:36.45]Vampires.
[282:39.73]Me?
[282:40.68]Yes, you!
[282:41.06]What are you doing over here?
[282:44.86]Lots of pixies.
[282:49.69]Lots of Walking Dead.
[282:50.86]Lots of Gremlins.
[282:51.86]Gremlins are weak, though.
[282:54.56]So random maps really are just all over the place, huh?
[282:58.24]I think I can... Lots of Walking Dead.
[283:00.02]Can I take them?
[283:02.90]This shit is everywhere.
[283:03.92]They're just, like, spammed in every direction.
[283:10.67]Uh, lots... I can probably take the Walking Dead.
[283:18.03]I can't really move.
[283:20.67]Okay, let's go up.
[283:25.57]Lots of harpies.
[283:26.55]A horde of imps.
[283:29.95]I think I can take the imps.
[283:44.68]Let's go... yeah, you up there.
[283:50.11]Vampire!
[283:50.99]How far away?
[283:51.61]Can they live?
[283:52.95]Oh, they're not ranged.
[283:54.65]Just let them come to me.
[284:05.31]Come to me.
[284:11.88]Four Vampires.
[284:12.72]Let's see.
[284:13.04]Let's see how four Vampires appear.
[284:19.57]very well uh I'm gonna wait with you oh you're running away no he's running down here well okay
[284:52.66]Very good!
[284:55.08]240 XP.
[284:57.22]And touch the obelisk.
[284:59.00]Ooh, puzzles!
[285:00.42]I haven't leveled up from any of this, though.
[285:12.34]I already did something today.
[285:13.40]Yeah, I did.
[285:17.56]Imagine having feet.
[285:18.60]What do you mean?
[285:18.96]Everybody has feet.
[285:24.78]They're expanding out here a little.
[285:29.38]Let's take on the gremlins.
[285:43.22]Not strong enough.
[285:49.75]I think that's why it's bullshit.
[285:56.23]No more spell power.
[285:57.31]Fuck.
[286:02.38]Just make your way around.
[286:03.44]Zombies are so slow.
[286:04.74]Mm-hmm.
[286:23.55]Good damage.
[286:25.33]Keep shuffling over there.
[286:28.64]So what, what, uh, what, uh, what is it?
[286:32.14]How much time is left in the, uh, finals game?
[286:42.89]Gem pond?
[286:45.03]Board of halflings.
[286:48.55]A minute and thirty seconds?
[286:49.55]That's not very long at all.
[286:53.40]I need to get by the harpies.
[286:55.04]I think I'll do one week.
[286:57.16]Grab some troops.
[287:01.78]I think so.
[287:05.06]Grab some more vampires and go kill the harpies.
[287:07.76]Yeah!
[287:11.80]Citadel!
[287:13.00]I want... I could upgrade.
[287:20.17]I need an amplifier.
[287:27.60]So I can get better vampires.
[287:33.96]And I can get more skeletons, so that's good.
[287:39.07]All right.
[287:39.53]What are you going to do, Purple?
[287:41.19]He's just browsing around, checking out his surroundings.
[287:46.95]Kind of like what I'm doing.
[287:52.87]All right.
[287:54.85]Level 2 Death Knight.
[287:56.57]Advanced Offense.
[287:59.42]That's insane.
[288:06.44]20% more damage.
[288:07.30]I mean, I kind of have to do that.
[288:11.40]We've got lots of Basilisks.
[288:12.98]I can't do that.
[288:14.88]Lots of Hobgoblins.
[288:17.38]What else is down there?
[288:23.83]Upgraded estate!
[288:25.85]Vampire lords!
[288:31.38]What's the difference?
[288:34.18]No enemy retaliation, undead.
[288:35.70]5 to 8, 30.
[288:39.32]5 to 8, 40.
[288:40.78]Drains life.
[288:43.42]Oh, they life leech.
[288:46.25]Okay, that's fucking awesome.
[288:49.13]Alright, so far so good.
[288:51.93]New week.
[288:53.97]Let's load him up, send him up north.
[288:58.56]I'm gonna give you the zombies and the skeletons.
[289:12.68]I'm gonna leave the wraiths because I want the other guy to have the wraiths.
[289:18.58]This is a pretty decent team.
[289:22.97]Although, what else can I build here?
[289:24.15]Alright, now Marketplace or Upgrade.
[289:32.55]So I do Wraiths.
[289:34.40]Grab the Mausoleum.
[289:35.62]Mausoleum.
[289:37.12]Let's get some Liches.
[289:40.52]It'll be for the other hero.
[289:43.84]We can take out these Harpies now.
[289:55.76]Meteor Shower.
[289:56.50]No reason to do this.
[289:57.90]Just throw a magic arrow.
[290:06.20]And you can... How far can you go?
[290:07.88]What's your speed?
[290:09.00]Six versus nine.
[290:10.64]So let's just chill for a minute back here.
[290:17.19]Chill again.
[290:19.69]You on the other hand, you move.
[290:31.70]I need to go again.
[290:32.34]I'm just gonna heal over and over again.
[290:40.24]I forgot they could do that.
[290:51.19]Wow.
[290:53.49]That's awesome.
[290:55.95]These things are ridiculous.
[291:10.04]Oh, uh, I mean, what can I do with this guy?
[291:22.43]Not much I can do.
[291:25.43]Vampire will take it out anyways.
[291:26.51]Fly away, whatever you do.
[291:33.01]Nice.
[291:34.45]I should level up from that.
[291:37.38]Advanced necromancy, or basic luck.
[291:40.90]20% of the critters killed to be brought back as skeletons.
[291:47.72]That sounds pretty great.
[291:49.87]We've unlocked, what is this?
[291:51.77]Tree of Knowledge.
[291:55.67]Tears brim in the eyes of the tree.
[291:57.27]I need ten gems.
[292:01.07]Well, come back when you can pay.
[292:04.35]Ten gems?
[292:08.37]It's an empty ca- it's a castle.
[292:09.57]Whose- whose castle is this?
[292:16.48]There's a fucking castle back there.
[292:17.62]All right, um, I'm gonna- let me head back.
[292:26.76]Because I want... I want the liches.
[292:32.15]I'm going for the castle.
[292:35.39]Can I get that castle right now?
[292:36.77]There's not much in it.
[292:48.44]Let's just see what happens.
[292:56.93]I'm not strong enough to do anything else.
[293:07.83]And I get all three of them.
[293:09.49]Three liches.
[293:12.81]I think if I come back and grab these three liches, I can take this capsule without a problem at all.
[293:25.34]I'm getting it.
[293:37.05]Yep.
[293:38.78]Alright, so I... mmm... Pack of serpent flies.
[293:48.76]I mean, I could... this should be easy.
[293:51.82]A pack of serpent flies?
[293:53.18]Just in case this goes horribly fucking wrong.
[294:02.03]These things, like, suck.
[294:04.27]No, I wanted to put... cast a damn spell.
[294:13.00]I'm not going to get the first hit.
[294:18.38]These things are really weak.
[294:21.10]Did I bite off more than I could chew here?
[294:35.99]If I could attack, I may have bitten off more than I could chew.
[294:50.48]Maybe.
[294:52.06]Didn't you kill him?
[294:59.72]Really?
[295:06.05]You little shits!
[295:07.57]Yeah, there's just too many of them.
[295:15.94]They just have, like, spread out everywhere.
[295:21.73]I still might do it.
[295:22.49]It's gonna be close.
[295:26.51]Nah, I should've just ran by.
[295:33.09]I still might do it.
[295:39.57]No, I don't think so.
[295:41.05]I'll just do my own thing.
[295:45.61]Nah, I'm bad at it.
[295:48.81]No.
[295:50.76]No, that's not.
[295:51.42]That's not going to happen.
[295:56.36]That's not going to happen.
[295:57.24]Sorry, guys.
[295:57.66]That's not going to happen.
[296:00.36]I was just curious.
[296:01.31]It's not going to happen.
[296:04.81]He's got to do ten push-ups now.
[296:10.59]Ow.
[296:10.85]God damn it.
[296:11.77]I've got to move this shit.
[296:13.69]I've got to get a different mic stand.
[296:15.10]I keep doing that.
[296:15.84]I keep banging my fucking hands.
[296:23.13]Okay, so... Let's go get that castle.
[296:38.56]I'm gonna leave this for the other guy.
[296:40.74]I think I can get it with just this.
[296:41.98]I don't want to be greedy.
[296:48.68]I could maybe attack the... No, let's get the castle.
[296:51.93]Let's get the damn castle.
[296:56.41]Nobody fucking even in here.
[296:57.29]Alright, you go restock.
[297:09.45]I can't really do anything, but I have money.
[297:12.08]Purple has gone into a portal.
[297:17.72]Seer's Hut.
[297:18.26]I'm gonna pack up Cyclops Kings.
[297:25.75]I think I'm gonna be able to start mass-producing artifacts, but I gotta have one first copy.
[297:30.23]I gotta bring you guys all this crap.
[297:33.81]This is... nice.
[297:34.92]Alright.
[297:36.32]This is... Blue is up here.
[297:45.65]Found the enemy.
[297:48.72]This is unclaimed.
[297:50.66]It is unclaimed for a very specific reason.
[297:53.98]Because you have to go through the pack of Cyclops Kings to take this castle.
[298:04.24]That is why it is currently not available.
[298:11.55]You can take them.
[298:17.46]I don't know if I can take them.
[298:22.17]I don't think that's gonna happen.
[298:30.57]Can I build anything else?
[298:31.59]Marketplace.
[298:32.70]Skeleton Transformer.
[298:36.08]Allows you to convert any creature into a skeleton.
[298:45.26]I need to get a marketplace.
[298:47.90]And a blacksmith.
[298:55.48]Actually, go rest in here.
[298:57.90]Just for a day.
[299:01.70]I don't know.
[299:02.12]You think it's worth it to try it?
[299:03.18]Blue's right there.
[299:04.12]I could fucking do this right now.
[299:05.92]If I have enough resources, it might be possible.
[299:10.75]What you got in there?
[299:11.81]Oh, you got nothing in here.
[299:13.57]I can take it right now for free.
[299:21.17]Go for the Cyclops Kingdom, try to get the pack of Cyclops, or go yoink this city for free.
[299:39.91]Oh, I don't know.
[299:40.61]It's so scary.
[299:43.75]The box that the Cyclops is guarding is OP.
[299:47.55]Alright, we're gonna split the timeline here.
[300:00.17]I'm dead.
[300:00.83]There's no way.
[300:01.55]It's not gonna happen.
[300:13.79]I could just try to go forward and... I don't know.
[300:17.45]No.
[300:18.45]Five, four, three, two, one.
[300:31.06]It's no use.
[300:31.60]I mean, I could... If I had a little bit more... If I had a little bit more... Yeah, it's no use.
[300:56.49]If I had some more, I'm gonna go for blue.
[301:01.18]If I get... Here's the thing.
[301:01.90]If I get Blue's Castle, then I can build up a little more and send somebody else down to take that other one.
[301:09.72]Alright, we're going to go back to the timeline.
[301:18.83]Okay.
[301:20.27]Although there are lots of gnolls, I could get this.
[301:22.35]I could do... Okay, this is the Magical Garden.
[301:24.29]I could take the gnolls.
[301:29.38]Don't engage it.
[301:34.01]Okay.
[301:35.41]Uh, a horde of skeleton warriors.
[301:36.75]I don't think I even need to pursue them for any reason.
[301:45.27]How many gems did the tree want?
[301:48.27]Ten?
[301:49.19]I'll do it with the other guy.
[301:50.07]Because I have to bring this other guy up here anyways.
[301:53.07]I don't want to go south.
[301:54.63]Because my buddy's got south covered.
[301:57.44]Purple's got south covered.
[302:00.52]You know?
[302:00.94]I'm going up north.
[302:03.41]Wait a minute, what's this?
[302:04.77]Hold on.
[302:06.89]Hold that thought for a sec.
[302:10.20]I need blacksmith.
[302:11.84]Yeah, I allied with purple.
[302:22.96]Hmm.
[302:23.52]How many more days...
[302:28.39]I just feel like this is not enough to do anything.
[302:30.85]Maybe to, like, get rid of the gremlins and just... Can I just keep walking?
[302:33.26]Let's just see what's over here.
[302:34.26]I might be able to get these pixies and the gremlins with this.
[302:46.52]Purple's going up.
[302:47.28]Where's purple going?
[302:52.87]Tree?
[302:53.19]Let's see.
[302:56.62]Plus one level.
[302:57.70]Ah, an adventurer.
[302:59.70]I'll be happy to teach you a little of what I learned over the ages for ten gems.
[303:04.10]Just bury it around my roots.
[303:20.47]Or earth magic.
[303:21.39]Advance wisdom.
[303:25.83]Or earth magic.
[303:28.12]Earth magic's really good.
[303:29.00]Alright, Blue, how you doing?
[303:32.99]You still got an empty castle?
[303:34.93]Yes, you do.
[303:38.01]Lots of pixies.
[303:39.31]I think I can handle it.
[303:40.89]I should be able to.
[303:44.15]Yeah, they're weak as absolute fuck.
[303:50.62]They're terrible.
[304:10.02]Instantly killed and... almost.
[304:18.39]About to lose the skeletons.
[304:23.57]Okay, cool.
[304:25.25]Lots of gremlins!
[304:27.71]I'm not sure it's worth doing that right this second.
[304:29.74]What's over here?
[304:31.24]Monolith one-way entrance.
[304:36.64]More pixies.
[304:44.36]Nah.
[304:45.50]Citadel!
[304:50.22]Wait for the city hall, I think.
[304:59.47]Yeah.
[305:02.81]God damn it, he's back.
[305:04.79]Timeline.
[305:05.81]Because I went down to the tree.
[305:08.66]The timeline has been split.
[305:09.94]That's why.
[305:10.28]Because of the tree.
[305:14.28]Because I went back into the tree.
[305:21.10]Should've just went with the plan.
[305:30.35]Fifty dollars just came in.
[305:32.63]And a bunch of community subs at the same time.
[305:37.19]Holy shit.
[305:39.38]Uh, Cyclops Parker just gave 10 community subs and $50 at the same time.
[305:46.88]Holy shit.
[305:48.68]Thank you so much for the huge amount of money.
[305:52.76]And they say, I can see why, it's great.
[306:01.66]It's really, really fun.
[306:02.52]It's super interesting.
[306:04.84]It's challenging.
[306:06.50]You gotta manage stuff.
[306:08.32]But it's not... The reason why I like this game is not... There's a lot of management, resource management.
[306:12.40]But it's not overbearing.
[306:16.06]It's just fun to collect stuff and look at scenarios.
[306:18.76]And it's really, really fun.
[306:22.12]I am going to... Keep going up.
[306:30.48]I feel like he's going to leave the castle.
[306:35.44]And he's going to go this way.
[306:40.50]I'm going to go back.
[306:43.80]Because it's a new week here in a second.
[306:50.81]I could have sniped the castle.
[306:51.91]I really could have.
[306:53.91]But I just didn't.
[306:55.81]I went back down to see what the tree did.
[306:58.93]Let's see.
[306:59.37]Did he leave?
[307:02.64]We did not leave.
[307:05.30]Damn it, that would have been so good, too.
[307:10.70]Kind of made the bed we have to sleep in, though.
[307:15.31]What do I want to do here?
[307:16.23]I want to do Citadel.
[307:22.53]Or City Hall.
[307:28.58]We have a new week.
[307:34.33]Let me take you back here.
[307:39.50]But thank you again so much to Cyclops Parker.
[307:41.84]It's a shitload of money.
[307:43.94]Let's stock you up with people and send you back out.
[307:51.31]Unfortunately... The throng of trolls... Monolith two-way.
[307:59.99]I want this motherfucker to leave.
[308:02.42]Horde of pixies...
[308:05.75]Random maps really are just so odd.
[308:07.34]It's kind of like somebody just threw up a bunch of stuff everywhere.
[308:10.56]Alright, um... Lots of hobgoblins.
[308:15.18]I'm going to be out here, though.
[308:19.34]I could probably do both of these and get the experience, but he might come out and be annoyed by this.
[308:28.68]Let's go this way.
[308:29.48]It's a lot, but I'm pretty sure I'll be fine.
[308:39.50]That's a pretty good start.
[308:41.12]What's their speed?
[308:41.86]Five?
[308:44.50]Let's just focus on you.
[308:56.45]Come on out.
[308:59.35]You really can't go very far, can you?
[309:05.74]Damn it.
[309:11.02]Well, let's just eat you.
[309:20.62]They group up, that's good.
[309:22.08]Losing a lot for a portal.
[309:52.88]Ah!
[309:52.94]Thought that was gonna be enough.
[309:55.10]It is.
[309:55.34]I'll get him back.
[309:57.42]Don't worry.
[309:57.90]These guys are strong, but they're just too slow.
[310:23.72]Good amount of experience, and then level up.
[310:25.46]Advanced earth magic or basic offense?
[310:34.00]Hmm.
[310:36.95]Probably advanced.
[310:39.83]Offense is good.
[310:40.53]10% more damage, but... I feel like that's really... I need that early.
[310:47.19]I feel like this is good early.
[310:48.99]I need the damage.
[310:57.38]Easy.
[310:58.20]Lots of zombies.
[310:58.90]Where the hell did I end up?
[311:00.84]This is two-way, right?
[311:04.00]Five gems.
[311:04.68]I'm over on purple's side.
[311:05.78]Not quite.
[311:08.66]Where the hell is this?
[311:12.00]There's red.
[311:14.84]This might have been bad.
[311:21.87]Blue is out of the house.
[311:24.29]I'm surrounded by red.
[311:27.94]Purple.
[311:28.34]I could use some reinforcements over here.
[311:33.70]Oh, boy!
[311:34.42]Wait a minute!
[311:36.14]You don't- Ooh!
[311:37.48]Ah, excuse me!
[311:38.34]You got one person!
[311:57.95]What about you?
[311:59.57]Ooh, several lots, several.
[312:01.47]I could wipe them both out.
[312:04.28]I think I got what it takes.
[312:07.28]Several lots, several.
[312:31.99]Back to base.
[312:34.01]Speaking of base.
[312:35.86]Ah, Citadel.
[312:40.62]Let's get some... I gotta get some more units, and I'm gonna take him out, and we're gonna go north again.
[312:47.07]Ain't nobody fucking in there.
[312:48.69]Okay, come on.
[312:50.77]We can really fuck Red's shit up right now.
[312:56.27]Blue's coming down here.
[313:01.39]I might have to go on the defensive.
[313:09.70]Several, few, few, lots, several.
[313:11.88]I might have to stick around in here.
[313:17.45]Add to the forces.
[313:22.29]I definitely need vampire lords and liches.
[313:32.45]I'm gonna stick around in here for now.
[313:35.15]But you, on the other hand, you.
[313:37.57]Dwarven treasury.
[313:38.43]Do I want to attack the dwarven treasury and get like a bunch of money right now?
[313:44.17]I think I'm gonna.
[313:45.55]Get the difficult one.
[314:06.05]In the corner.
[314:19.86]And... He can take care of that.
[314:24.50]I'm going up in this corner.
[314:25.58]No, I'm going to stay down here and protect.
[314:27.06]Because this guy, I don't want this guy to die.
[314:34.56]I can fly over here with him.
[314:35.78]I'm not gonna go down.
[314:39.02]He's not gonna be able to make it.
[314:39.96]They're so slow.
[314:45.65]Ah, fuck you.
[314:46.59]Don't get to go twice.
[314:47.57]God damn it.
[314:49.15]That sucks.
[314:51.45]I'll deal with you later.
[315:13.59]Come on, man, really?
[315:25.65]Why are you guys so fucking beefy?
[315:33.90]How much health do you have?
[315:40.34]I'm in trouble.
[315:49.67]Yeah, I might still do it.
[315:50.89]Kill this one.
[315:54.71]Yeah, I'll do it.
[315:59.79]I got 17 of these things.
[316:00.64]Who's got the least amount by this guy down here?
[316:20.72]Keep this one occupied.
[316:21.68]You're going to lose, but I'll get the skeletons back.
[316:27.98]This might be worth it for the money.
[316:34.34]We've got 15 fly up here.
[316:37.40]Get away from those people.
[316:42.44]Why do you get to go twice?
[317:01.00]It's gonna be close, but I'm gonna do it.
[317:09.78]Come on, man.
[317:11.70]Come on!
[317:13.52]Do it!
[317:24.73]Vampires are fucking insane.
[317:28.29]Especially the upgraded ones.
[317:30.59]Alright, that was a good fight.
[317:31.77]I got 1500 experience.
[317:33.37]I lost everything except the vampires, but I leveled up.
[317:38.87]Basic intelligence or advanced wisdom.
[317:40.95]Fourth level spells or more spell points.
[317:47.90]Just have full stacks of vampires.
[317:52.62]Yeah, take the intelligence.
[317:54.84]4,000 golden three crystals.
[317:57.08]It was worth it, because now I can protect the base.
[318:02.30]It was worth it.
[318:02.80]It was.
[318:03.50]I had to do it.
[318:11.84]One way.
[318:14.44]One way.
[318:15.16]This sucks.
[318:17.26]Why does everything have to be so weird and spread out?
[318:21.85]Now I can afford more, or I can afford a lot of this now.
[318:26.09]Bang.
[318:28.83]I'm very protected at this point.
[318:30.19]If he comes down here.
[318:31.13]I at least got to fortify the base.
[318:38.20]He's making his way down.
[318:39.08]What does he have?
[318:40.90]Pretty similar.
[318:50.96]I need to get out of the base, let me see.
[318:54.03]Who the fuck are you?
[318:58.39]Several pack pack several.
[319:04.11]You come- you fucking wanna fuck around?
[319:10.59]Why is everybody coming after me?
[319:12.47]What- I have like a whole other teammate!
[319:14.55]You got another castle up here?
[319:18.93]I'm getting swarmed!
[319:23.09]I can't take on two defenses.
[319:24.53]I can get rid of you right now.
[319:26.11]Hold on, save this.
[319:35.12]Original team timeline.
[319:44.70]Honestly, I should have just taken this base.
[319:47.24]I should have.
[319:47.74]I shouldn't have went back down.
[319:48.78]That was a mistake.
[319:50.80]I could have just taken blue.
[319:56.43]There are one, two... I'm being swarmed right now.
[320:04.11]Purple just like went this way uncontested and just took this.
[320:09.22]Okay.
[320:18.10]Well, I can either... I might just go kill this person right now.
[320:22.20]And then hope that I can get enough.
[320:26.06]Because this is a lot coming in.
[320:28.46]Hopefully you just go over here.
[320:29.72]But then you'll get the fucking castle.
[320:31.17]God damn it.
[320:35.49]Well, we'll see what happens.
[320:37.19]Here we go.
[320:43.03]Okay, now I am going to kill you.
[320:43.91]Because you're not coming up.
[320:45.45]Blue's not coming this way.
[320:48.10]I need to go back through this portal.
[320:52.98]A horde of imps.
[321:00.43]I have to fight these zombies to get through the portal again.
[321:08.21]How do I get out?
[321:17.39]First of all, I'm gonna delete you.
[321:21.13]I don't like you over here.
[321:22.53]I don't like what you're doing.
[321:24.06]I'm killing her.
[321:24.50]Here are your ranged units.
[321:32.60]Let's go with the Eyeball.
[321:44.08]That's a better shot.
[321:44.92]I don't have a good angle on anybody.
[321:49.55]You know do it like I could do it here get the other range Fly up this way Targeting the lich it's fine.
[322:08.37]It's all focusing on him and he's gonna die All right, uh, I'm going straight in here.
[322:14.69]Oh
[322:20.17]Or maybe I should get you.
[322:22.68]Stoneskin to, uh, you.
[322:25.58]Let's see if I can kill you, because you're ranged.
[322:34.65]Right here.
[322:39.89]That'll do it.
[322:41.71]Flying back.
[322:49.06]Gotta get you.
[322:50.00]Let's go, you up here.
[322:50.90]I might actually lose.
[323:07.86]I mean, this motherfucker's just gonna walk around and take all my resources.
[323:10.92]I had to do something.
[323:19.06]Get my wraiths in there!
[323:26.71]Good, there we go.
[323:32.01]I have one skeleton.
[323:34.43]Hi!
[323:37.59]Nah, I got it.
[323:42.30]Open.
[323:44.24]It's gonna happen.
[323:48.82]Vampire's too strong.
[323:58.24]Yeah.
[323:59.14]That's good.
[324:01.40]Good to go.
[324:01.82]You've been defeated.
[324:07.32]Advanced Necromancy or Basic Armor.
[324:22.56]So you've been vanquished.
[324:23.68]That's good.
[324:24.42]Five skeletons have been brought in.
[324:25.90]I could... I got this asshole to deal with, though.
[324:30.30]He went up here.
[324:30.98]He's just hanging out over here.
[324:32.90]He's gonna go in the portal, I think.
[324:37.17]Oh, shit.
[324:38.95]He's gonna go in the portal that I'm standing in front of.
[324:40.95]I'm screwed.
[324:46.21]Is it a different one?
[324:46.95]I hope so.
[324:51.68]Alright, I need 10,000.
[324:53.97]I think it's time to upgrade some of these.
[324:56.73]Let's get... Let's up this to the wraith upgrade.
[325:11.61]Let's see what happens.
[325:14.77]Going in the portal?
[325:15.49]No.
[325:15.65]Deciding against it.
[325:17.41]Where's purple going?
[325:18.83]My buddy perp.
[325:23.65]The one issue that I have is, can I kill lots of zombies with just seven vampires?
[325:32.76]I'm not sure I can.
[325:36.07]I know I can do this.
[325:36.87]Let me do this first.
[325:58.56]Everybody collapse on the goblins!
[326:03.72]Hello.
[326:15.89]D'oh!
[326:24.58]Dead!
[326:25.66]Hooray, nice job.
[326:28.68]Give me that.
[326:31.42]One-way exit.
[326:32.98]One-way entrance.
[326:34.41]Where the hell is all this stuff going?
[326:36.07]They're everywhere.
[326:36.97]I feel like I'm in the Arcane Sanctuary.
[326:42.87]What the hell else is even over here?
[326:44.07]Let's see if I can do it.
[326:48.54]I mean, they're pretty sloppy, but...
[326:55.11]I don't have enough to do any of this.
[326:56.28]We just have to fly over there and... what's your speed?
[326:58.90]Four.
[327:08.74]I should kill you very quickly.
[327:13.73]Three zombies perish.
[327:15.09]I don't think so.
[327:17.21]Fifteen.
[327:17.79]No, I'm gonna lose.
[327:22.42]It's only... maybe.
[327:25.58]Maybe.
[327:26.10]If I can keep healing, maybe.
[327:27.98]I don't think I'm gonna do it.
[327:42.58]I can't heal.
[327:43.10]Yeah, I cannot steal life from dead things.
[327:46.30]Yep.
[327:54.71]Well, this was a mistake.
[327:58.47]Can't heal from the undead.
[327:59.53]I didn't even know that.
[328:01.33]I just didn't realize that.
[328:08.63]Now I said I wasn't going to save scum anymore.
[328:12.85]But... I am.
[328:23.65]I'm kinda just fucking stuck back here.
[328:31.68]I'm stuck back here.
[328:32.60]I don't have enough to do anything.
[328:35.92]Can I, like, make my way over to purple?
[328:39.66]Do I have any way to get back to purple?
[328:44.26]I really don't think I'm... I can go anywhere.
[328:46.75]Let's see what happens if I go this way.
[328:50.95]Is there a place to go down here, maybe?
[329:01.01]Can I build anything?
[329:04.49]What day is it?
[329:04.93]Day 5?
[329:08.33]Hall of Darkness.
[329:10.70]6,000.
[329:12.04]I'll save it.
[329:13.84]So we can get the growth.
[329:14.60]Can I make it down here?
[329:25.68]One-way entrance?
[329:26.50]Should I just go in this shit?
[329:28.94]I'm gonna end up somewhere.
[329:29.96]I'm gonna end up in like a wall.
[329:34.49]I can't even move any further.
[329:43.07]Maybe it'll be this one.
[329:44.85]That's the hope, right?
[329:50.07]Red's coming over to blue.
[329:51.43]Is red and blue teammates?
[329:58.77]Let's go back.
[330:07.97]Power liches?
[330:10.94]I think I want to get that.
[330:11.82]Do I need another castle?
[330:14.44]Any more money?
[330:18.90]Yeah.
[330:23.17]Well, let's see.
[330:24.49]Let's go next week.
[330:26.17]Or almost next week.
[330:38.24]Cross your fingers.
[330:39.52]Three, two, one... Yes!
[330:43.66]Haha, I'm fine!
[330:44.64]Hooray!
[330:45.78]Thank God!
[330:46.38]Alright, here comes the growth.
[330:58.41]Before that happens though, can I get a Hall of Darkness?
[331:02.35]I cannot.
[331:05.25]But I can upgrade the mausoleum.
[331:10.69]So power liches are available.
[331:15.94]11, 15, 40.
[331:16.96]11, 13, 30.
[331:17.60]Okay, cool.
[331:23.54]Let's go.
[331:25.26]Red has taken over that castle.
[331:31.55]It's orange.
[331:32.05]I haven't seen orange for the first time.
[331:33.09]There's orange right there.
[331:39.03]Not very much.
[331:40.57]And it's empty.
[331:46.14]Alright.
[331:47.34]Let's get... Power Liches.
[331:51.45]Actually, no, let's do Vampires first.
[332:07.56]Maybe go down?
[332:08.58]No, you need to go back and get, like, minions.
[332:11.04]I have seven fucking things.
[332:14.00]This other guy's coming out.
[332:16.59]You've got enough to do something.
[332:19.59]Head down.
[332:19.99]I can start clearing this shit out and actually taking this stuff and then meeting down with purple here.
[332:32.32]Let's just go here.
[332:32.86]No money?
[332:34.40]No money?
[332:36.92]Are you coming down here?
[332:46.69]So... Let's get these.
[332:56.18]Lots of walking dead.
[332:58.90]Do not engage.
[333:04.36]That's all I can really do this week.
[333:07.16]Don't.
[333:07.54]He's coming down.
[333:08.76]Shit.
[333:15.61]Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
[333:17.09]What is he coming down with?
[333:24.56]Pack, few, few, several, lots.
[333:26.92]Not horrible.
[333:40.90]By the time he gets here, I'll have a force, and he won't be able to get it.
[333:43.40]I highly doubt that.
[333:45.70]I think I can get this one, too.
[333:51.69]Think about engaging.
[333:52.65]Why would I?
[333:53.07]It's just free stuff.
[333:55.01]Horde of Halflings.
[333:58.91]Let's see what happens.
[334:00.19]Here he comes.
[334:01.75]On his way.
[334:15.90]You're gonna be throwing shit, so might as well just fly over there.
[334:24.28]You're gonna be throwing shit!
[334:26.90]Ares isn't helping.
[334:27.66]He's kind of just doing his own thing down there.
[334:31.15]I'm not sure he's seen any action at all.
[334:34.87]I've had like two or three encounters.
[334:47.29]Wish I started at the bottom.
[334:52.54]Wish I started at the fucking bottom.
[334:54.06]Where I got like all the stuff and nobody fought me.
[334:59.22]Nah, it's still alright.
[335:01.14]I'm not like in a great position, but... I mean, what am I gonna do?
[335:04.61]What am I gonna fucking cry about it?
[335:05.75]What am I gonna cry?
[335:07.17]Uh, lots of hop goblins.
[335:16.49]Let's do these first.
[335:25.79]Six power liches.
[335:26.67]That's all I can do for now.
[335:31.41]I can do some skeletons.
[335:34.66]I am afraid of you.
[335:36.20]I don't think you're going to come over here, though.
[335:38.18]I could be wrong.
[335:41.02]Hmm.
[335:41.34]We've got another one.
[335:44.56]I don't think that one has very much stuff, though.
[335:48.78]Alright, purple.
[335:49.36]You're fucking walking in circles.
[335:51.22]Yeah, this is not very much.
[336:10.66]That's decent.
[336:11.96]I might take it.
[336:12.60]I might go for it.
[336:16.70]Pack a few lots of pixies, though.
[336:25.81]Let's do this down here first.
[336:30.68]Some wood down here.
[336:31.56]Hobgoblins.
[336:35.38]Should be easy enough.
[336:40.47]Pixies are skeleton fuel.
[336:41.83]Yeah, that's true.
[336:58.40]pretty good lots of wood campfire 500 bucks I'll take it pack of zealots all right pack pack few I think it's time to attempt something here I can get a couple more at least fill up a little bit it's time to defend the home
[337:40.52]The only dangerous thing here is this.
[337:45.44]Meteor Shower.
[337:46.36]I can hit them both.
[337:47.66]Except that's ice.
[337:49.48]I should hit these two down here.
[337:53.66]Air.
[337:54.61]Sprites.
[337:55.59]He is like made out of fire.
[337:56.75]I'm probably going to do it down here.
[338:02.91]I can't hit him with any spells.
[338:05.77]I think I should just do it up here.
[338:10.86]Might as well.
[338:19.73]Man, that's fine.
[338:21.81]Ah, do you have ranged?
[338:22.61]No, you don't.
[338:23.23]Anybody have ranged?
[338:26.33]None of you have ranged.
[338:27.49]So... Let's hang back for a minute.
[338:34.15]What's your speed? 6...
[338:40.28]I'll just get rid of you.
[338:50.23]This should be pretty clean.
[338:53.39]Should get first attack advantage on everybody here.
[338:55.93]I wonder if I should go just focus on the fire elemental with the air elemental, fire elemental.
[339:09.52]No retaliation, that's good.
[339:12.56]Yeah, get rid of the elemental.
[339:14.39]I really want to get rid of the skeletons, apparently.
[339:30.44]Well, whatever you do, you're dead.
[339:41.86]Let's go with the 20 good pixies.
[339:46.74]Just instantly kill it.
[339:50.14]You are now surrounded.
[340:01.67]Don't fucking retreat!
[340:03.15]I was trying to stop that from happening.
[340:04.57]Retreated.
[340:07.53]Dick!
[340:10.05]I'm taking that castle.
[340:12.92]I'm going up right fucking now.
[340:26.75]That castle's gonna be mine in a second.
[340:31.10]Purple, come up!
[340:54.04]What have we got down here?
[340:54.86]I don't care about that.
[341:00.39]Hordak Remlins.
[341:02.71]I can handle the Hordak Remlins.
[341:14.26]This should be very easy.
[341:19.36]At least I hope so.
[341:24.23]Purple's gonna have a huge army by the time this all is over with.
[341:28.55]I should have done that.
[341:29.69]Sorry.
[341:33.54]I'm just being the wall right now.
[341:34.92]I'm just trying to protect everything and try to stop them from encroaching while Purple gets five million people in his army.
[341:40.50]Okay, here we go.
[341:41.82]Expert necromancy.
[341:43.14]I want that.
[341:46.32]And I want the bank.
[341:48.24]Can't move.
[341:54.25]Capital.
[341:54.67]I'm gonna wait.
[341:59.32]Don't go in there!
[342:00.56]Ah!
[342:05.30]Blue's dead.
[342:05.82]Did purple just take another castle that wasn't a neutral castle?
[342:15.83]There ain't much in here, man.
[342:18.43]I think I can do it.
[342:31.19]I might as well just take it.
[342:33.59]I think I'm gonna be just good.
[342:36.78]We've found a Naga Bank.
[342:40.10]Do you wish to attack the guards?
[342:41.64]42, 8, 16, 10.
[342:43.66]Red has another guy right there.
[342:50.48]Yeah, Red does have another guy.
[342:51.62]Ooh!
[342:58.49]New castle!
[343:01.37]I just have to go through the imps.
[343:08.66]Shit!
[343:09.16]Okay.
[343:10.30]Things are looking up.
[343:14.06]And I'm gonna get a capital.
[343:22.41]Tan's down there.
[343:25.09]Come on, purple.
[343:25.75]Keep building.
[343:32.24]So this is just a random castle.
[343:34.46]Can I- do I have enough to take it?
[343:40.40]I think I do.
[343:41.56]Do I, though?
[343:42.20]It might not be.
[343:46.00]I think I can get it.
[343:46.72]Let me just make sure I- I- let me just put it in a safe way.
[343:52.24]Oh, I thought it was a castle.
[343:55.22]What is it with this?
[343:55.84]Um...
[344:00.89]I thought it was gonna have, like, to lay siege.
[344:03.21]It doesn't have a fort.
[344:07.63]Okay.
[344:08.51]Well, alright, I'll do it.
[344:18.06]Alright, at least I have another castle now.
[344:33.27]Got it.
[344:36.05]The castle is mine.
[344:40.03]Perfect.
[344:41.99]Now let me look up here.
[344:47.49]You've left a little bit.
[344:57.70]This is still down here.
[345:18.75]He just came out?
[345:20.11]He was inside.
[345:22.21]I'm able to get two birds with one stone here.
[345:27.36]You hang out in there for now.
[345:32.46]Is he just hanging out in there?
[345:35.34]Basic Resistance or Advanced Intelligence?
[345:38.14]I'm gonna say... Advanced Intelligence.
[345:54.94]All right, build a fort.
[345:58.17]Five grand!
[345:59.27]How much are these worth?
[346:05.73]I can take them all, right?
[346:07.27]I don't think I even want these things.
[346:10.73]Well, I mean... It's got more people.
[346:16.74]I'm gonna claim some stuff.
[346:23.94]Horde of Royal Griffins.
[346:27.13]Experience.
[346:29.37]Okay.
[346:30.01]This is the point when I decided this is worth doing.
[346:33.97]And I might be wrong.
[346:35.32]I just learned Fireball.
[346:51.50]He doesn't even have a fort!
[346:53.14]He doesn't have a fucking fort built!
[346:55.86]What?
[346:56.20]Why?
[347:03.67]I got this in the bag.
[347:07.27]I can take out the... Yeah, I can... I'll probably melt almost all of them.
[347:18.25]Good.
[347:19.56]Right off the bat.
[347:26.61]Let's go down here.
[347:27.39]No, let's go... yeah, down here.
[347:33.36]That's fine.
[347:34.42]Just skeletons.
[347:36.36]I'm gonna stay together.
[347:37.10]Who is the threat?
[347:44.50]Nobody has ranged?
[347:47.06]I'm just gonna go after you.
[347:50.45]Because you're the strongest.
[348:00.88]I got to go twice.
[348:01.86]That was bullshit.
[348:02.54]Bullshit.
[348:05.04]Didn't you go three fucking times?
[348:16.43]Fireball?
[348:17.57]No.
[348:19.97]Stoneskin, shield... Magic.
[348:23.20]If it's just Stoneskin, this is technically melee, right?
[348:30.68]Alright, surround him.
[348:35.10]This guy's not gonna be able to do anything.
[348:38.68]I guess he is.
[348:39.80]It's alright, I'm gonna get it.
[348:43.06]Focus on the one that we're focusing on.
[348:52.96]Now you decide to come over here.
[349:03.80]I can't attack.
[349:04.38]Whatever.
[349:04.80]Just get him.
[349:10.12]You really want to get these liches, huh?
[349:14.16]Should I just run?
[349:14.76]Should I just fucking run away?
[349:17.25]No, I can kill him.
[349:19.19]He's not going to retaliate.
[349:26.51]This should be it.
[349:29.03]Castle's mine.
[349:32.13]660... what do you... oh, it was Luna.
[349:37.11]I remember Luna.
[349:38.35]Basic Scholar!
[349:42.82]Trading spells between spellbooks or advanced earth magic.
[349:45.80]Probably advanced earth magic.
[349:53.00]Dude, that's... This is fucking two castles in 15 minutes.
[350:00.39]And I can get some more creatures.
[350:03.75]How do you not have a fort?
[350:07.85]Interesting.
[350:08.35]Alright, well... Park here for a second.
[350:19.15]So I got one, two, three.
[350:20.57]I got three castles now.
[350:21.61]This one is down here.
[350:25.35]Alright.
[350:25.97]I got my buddy going down here.
[350:29.91]That's our end of our turn.
[350:32.76]Red's probably pissed.
[350:35.03]Purple stills just stockpiling massive amounts of money.
[350:39.79]Expert offense.
[350:44.90]Oh, we're basic ballistics.
[350:52.56]I probably would do offense.
[350:53.56]I just want to be able to do damage, man.
[351:03.39]Lots of familiars and a horde of harpy hags.
[351:07.55]Um, I got a pretty decent army here.
[351:08.91]Let me go up here, though.
[351:20.12]I need City Hall.
[351:21.30]Or I need Fort.
[351:23.58]Five grand?
[351:25.36]Twenty-twenty?
[351:30.66]I need another hero.
[351:33.74]From, probably, just from here.
[351:35.64]Look at all this.
[351:36.12]There's so much here.
[351:41.92]Where's my tavern?
[351:46.58]Death Knight or Witch?
[351:52.54]I mean, I have like three Death Knights.
[351:56.86]I have the, am I supposed to do Super Necromancer?
[352:08.67]No, for a second I was like, what's with the second photo that was taken?
[352:14.89]That person just lifted their arm up and you took like three photos at the same time.
[352:17.88]Just like click, click, click.
[352:19.54]Okay.
[352:25.94]How we doing?
[352:27.56]Purple, how we doing?
[352:32.72]Purple's got lots of shit down here.
[352:36.39]They still have that.
[352:37.83]Bastards.
[352:41.64]It's time to come out.
[352:46.02]I'm coming out.
[352:46.50]I need a fucking fort.
[352:51.73]I'm coming out.
[352:52.21]We're going to get rid of these pixies.
[352:56.45]And there's a bank right there.
[352:59.19]Orc chieftain.
[352:59.87]Let's go up.
[353:02.74]There's a learned landmine.
[353:03.82]That's good.
[353:06.40]What else is over here?
[353:10.46]Alright, I think I can take these people on, but... I would just save them, just in case something fucking horrible happens.
[353:17.92]Third level spell, Mirth.
[353:25.47]Lots of gnolls.
[353:26.71]I can take them easily, I think.
[353:31.45]Yeah.
[353:33.99]Show Otto's feet.
[353:44.22]Didn't we talk about this, like, already, like, a few weeks ago?
[353:50.89]Yeah, Kim, like, wrote that, and then the fucking lid blew off.
[353:59.64]Ban that person?
[354:00.68]Well, it was my girlfriend.
[354:02.30]So, Kim's banned.
[354:12.86]That's who it was.
[354:14.00]Ban that person.
[354:29.73]And go!
[354:33.39]Holy shit, you guys are not strong.
[354:35.77]You guys are not strong at all.
[354:42.23]You're not strong to a point where I'm embarrassed for even coming over here with the wolf riders.
[354:48.74]Daring, we're gonna get banned to the couch.
[354:57.60]Prison!
[354:58.60]In a dazzling display of daring, you break into the local jail and free the hero imprisoned here, who in return pledges loyalty to your cause!
[355:07.30]What?!
[355:10.04]Level 5, Malcolm.
[355:14.90]I got a new hero!
[355:16.68]Sick!
[355:22.40]Oh, that's so cool.
[355:25.68]And, I'm at the end down here, so there's nothing else to claim.
[355:30.57]Horde of Harpy He-
[355:47.67]What's their speed?
[355:48.35]They can go pretty far.
[355:49.35]I'm gonna just wait for them.
[355:50.37]I don't think you can go that far.
[355:56.13]Yeah, good.
[356:03.81]They're all going down.
[356:04.75]Why are you all going down?
[356:07.39]All of you are going that way?
[356:17.74]Uh-oh.
[356:21.10]Every single one of them is down.
[356:23.12]I might run backwards.
[356:28.11]I did not expect every single one of them to come down here and get in a fucking line.
[356:32.15]Ugh.
[356:34.81]Shit, I'm gonna fly away with the, uh...
[356:49.37]I don't have Meteor on this character.
[356:51.31]This character doesn't have it.
[356:53.85]I'm screwed.
[356:57.35]I mean, I have 82 skeletons up here, but every single one of them flew down three... Like, what the hell is this?
[357:03.59]This is bullshit, is what it is.
[357:05.15]I just send people, whatever.
[357:11.92]What am I gonna do, run?
[357:13.74]I mean, I think I am.
[357:20.12]Do I stand and fight, or do I fly back here to the friends?
[357:24.26]I think I'm going back to the friends.
[357:26.94]Yep.
[357:33.20]82 skeletons coming in.
[357:34.98]What is this dog shit?
[357:36.60]Why do they get it, like, every time?
[357:37.74]Pain in the balls.
[358:05.36]Get him down here!
[358:09.88]Just wait till my big brother shows up.
[358:12.10]And, oh, Del, why don't you go again?
[358:13.66]Just go again.
[358:14.10]Might as well just go again.
[358:14.88]I don't think I've seen that spell on my character in, like, fucking a week.
[358:27.49]Well, now I'm gonna head back this way.
[358:32.15]I just didn't expect this shit.
[358:34.15]What kind of dumb fucking strategy did the computer decide to do right now?
[358:41.52]How could I have ever expected that this was gonna happen?
[358:58.64]Get in here!
[359:07.09]This necklace better be fucking worth it.
[359:09.61]Alright, we're in.
[359:21.62]I hate these things so much.
[359:22.94]Can one of you die?
[359:33.53]Finally.
[359:35.39]Jesus.
[359:37.57]Tally it and kill it.
[360:22.95]This is so stupid The idiocy involved in how this played out This is dumb
[360:49.33]We're in the fucking corner.
[360:52.31]As far in the corner as everybody.
[360:55.33]What the hell?
[361:04.16]I'm gonna... hopefully I get a bunch of skeletons for this.
[361:17.76]If I lose this...
[361:21.68]I don't even know, man.
[361:23.42]I'm gonna fucking lose my mind if I don't win this.
[361:28.01]No, there's no way.
[361:29.01]I'm gonna win.
[361:31.13]Thanks for the artifact.
[361:45.20]5% more damage or what?
[361:53.24]I mean, that's better.
[361:55.28]Wisdom.
[361:57.72]Or a spell.
[361:58.58]I need more spells.
[361:59.40]I don't have any.
[362:04.88]What is it?
[362:05.78]I can't even look at it.
[362:08.43]Fucking hell.
[362:09.29]That fight sucked.
[362:15.83]Tan's coming down.
[362:22.00]Necklace of Dragon Teeth.
[362:23.94]Please have it be worth something.
[362:32.60]That's actually really good.
[362:36.14]That's really good, actually.
[362:42.43]I'm not upset by that.
[362:43.29]I'm actually very happy about that.
[362:46.29]Now I don't have enough to get this.
[362:48.97]And I don't think he does either.
[362:49.95]A horde of... Do I really... I think I have to come back at another time.
[362:55.25]Maybe I could combine them together and I could take this.
[363:02.77]I could give him the centaurs and the orcs.
[363:07.52]That's like 50 to 100 frogs.
[363:11.86]No, I can't.
[363:13.54]It's not gonna happen.
[363:17.85]Not with this tiny little group.
[363:21.17]Let's plant this hero up here.
[363:27.68]Save game.
[363:28.38]Yes, I will.
[363:31.22]I wish it wasn't going to be like this, but it is.
[363:34.44]What is up here?
[363:35.08]Earth elementals.
[363:41.02]Artifacts.
[363:41.62]Spirit of Oppression versus Horde of Harpies.
[363:44.14]I don't want to fight Harpy Hags again, but I think I'm about to.
[363:48.72]Am I about to fight a horde of harpy hags again?
[363:52.12]For another?
[363:58.97]No, I'm not.
[364:05.85]Alright, what can I do here?
[364:10.23]You're ready to come out.
[364:12.99]But in a second.
[364:14.19]Now you are.
[364:16.49]No, you're not.
[364:17.24]I want you to get more.
[364:20.92]I'm gonna put the dwarf in that building.
[364:27.62]We're getting awfully close here.
[365:02.28]Can I... This is not gonna be good.
[365:12.14]He's gonna take the castle, probably.
[365:21.34]I'm fucked.
[365:22.74]Well, just take this and whatever.
[365:24.26]He's... I can get it right back.
[365:28.07]Like, what am I gonna do?
[365:32.69]There's no fort.
[365:33.45]Yeah, he's gonna have to build a fucking fort.
[365:46.30]We'll just keep moving up.
[365:55.79]Little doggy.
[365:58.45]I think that's Midas.
[365:59.25]I don't think that's Otto.
[366:07.28]Uh, can I do anything else?
[366:12.75]Hold on, let me be right back.
[366:14.09]Something else is, like, going on.
[366:15.58]Hold on.
[366:16.86]Be right back.
[366:41.54]Thank you.
[367:29.12]Thank you.
[368:09.99]I have no idea.
[368:19.37]Minus was just barking at, uh, a ghost?
[368:24.35]I don't know.
[368:24.65]Maybe it was a skeleton.
[368:31.91]Hmm.
[368:33.87]All right, do I want you or you?
[368:42.08]Oh, I need to... here.
[368:43.24]Let me go here.
[368:50.00]Okay... Just take this castle while I stare at you.
[368:57.11]He doesn't really have that much, either.
[369:00.99]That's the thing that sucks, is he just... he's gonna just walk in and take it, and then I'm gonna take it back.
[369:10.38]This is gonna be so dumb.
[369:12.48]No, he decided against it.
[369:13.66]He's coming down this way now.
[369:14.78]Good, because now I'll just kill him.
[369:17.94]Alright, purple.
[369:18.44]I'm going to need you to start swooping around the other side.
[369:21.52]Stop collecting resources and get over here.
[369:28.89]Pack several lots.
[369:30.41]Pack several.
[369:31.41]He's dead.
[369:45.55]26, 18, 8.
[369:46.61]I think that's enough.
[369:49.37]Purple doesn't give a shit about me.
[369:50.90]I know.
[369:51.18]That's what... Get over here!
[369:55.32]Kill something.
[369:56.06]Fight something.
[369:57.10]What are you doing with this thing?
[369:59.84]Look at all this around you.
[370:01.90]Look how many enemies you have slain.
[370:04.65]Let me look at his heroes.
[370:06.99]Alright.
[370:08.67]Dude.
[370:10.61]Get over here.
[370:14.68]Orange is just in your base.
[370:18.20]I'm going down there.
[370:19.16]I gotta find a way to get over there.
[370:23.48]You've been hiding over here too, haven't you?
[370:26.76]See, look, I'm just... They're attacking me and he's just collecting fucking... This guy's just hiding back here.
[370:36.10]Pack lots, lots, several.
[370:43.22]God damn it.
[370:45.63]I should just stay in the damn castle.
[370:52.21]Right?
[370:52.53]I mean... I'm gonna upgrade the... I'm gonna upgrade this.
[370:59.28]Turn the skeletons into skeleton warriors.
[371:05.66]Can't do it yet.
[371:10.40]Well, let's just continue what I was doing here.
[371:12.01]You go in here.
[371:14.74]Park yourself that way.
[371:15.62]I don't have any money to do anything.
[371:17.82]I would like for you to... Get back in here.
[371:25.07]I collected that thing.
[371:31.27]Yeah, and then maybe I'll go in that portal.
[371:34.41]Hang out in here for now.
[371:36.78]We're gonna be a turtle for a minute.
[371:38.96]Just because of what's going on over here.
[371:43.78]A horde of swordsmen.
[371:45.42]Lots of walking dead.
[371:47.15]I can't really do anything.
[371:48.43]The dwarf will come out and take care of that.
[371:51.11]Tomorrow.
[371:54.99]They're both just standing here.
[371:58.36]Purple, are you just going to let him do this?
[372:03.08]He's picking strawberries.
[372:11.31]Everything is taken from him.
[372:17.65]I don't think I can beat the hellhounds.
[372:25.45]More vampires.
[372:26.25]That's all I can do at the moment.
[372:29.80]I need more, like, money-making castles.
[372:36.06]Alright, next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make some more citadels.
[372:39.56]Or some more, um, money.
[372:49.40]Like a town hall.
[372:50.58]Yeah.
[372:51.28]Okay, I need a tavern.
[372:53.02]Tavern, town hall.
[372:55.04]Down here.
[373:03.25]Man, am I gonna buy this game?
[373:04.49]Oh, I hope you do.
[373:07.61]Purple, what the fuck are you doing?
[373:11.51]Purple's gonna lose.
[373:17.17]I hope you do.
[373:17.56]It's really, really good.
[373:18.82]It's a really fun game.
[373:21.38]It's super fun, super interesting.
[373:23.04]It's... It's very, very good.
[373:30.52]I might be able to get this castle if I try.
[373:32.55]Am I using the HD mod?
[373:33.63]Yes, I am.
[373:35.49]This is the original one from Good Old Games with the complete pack and the HD patch on top of it.
[373:52.05]No, let me stick with the plan.
[373:53.19]I was going to buy the tavern and then so I could get to the town halls and make money.
[374:01.18]And what is left over here, I'm going to fortify and I'm going to come up and kill this guy.
[374:11.70]Some more liches.
[374:15.68]Skeletal warriors, I can't.
[374:24.05]I think I can kill him right now.
[374:26.67]I think so.
[374:36.39]He's not going to come into the base.
[374:38.17]I know that for a fact.
[374:40.53]Several lots, several... Yeah, he's dead.
[374:45.13]He doesn't have fucking anything.
[374:49.28]Let's get rid of the ranged, which is... Who does more damage?
[374:53.31]6 to 8 and 3 to 5.
[374:55.61]Let's cast this on you.
[374:57.99]Try to get rid of you first.
[375:03.17]I mean, like, let's go.
[375:04.87]Get you over here.
[375:17.73]Perfect spot, thanks for going there.
[375:19.67]Just helped me out so bad.
[375:21.89]It is a very timeless game, it is.
[375:24.09]And even though, I mean, I'm not necessarily, like, that great at it.
[375:28.45]It's just interesting, it's fun.
[375:30.58]I never really liked games like this.
[375:31.92]Games with tile-based movement and strategy management.
[375:37.40]It's not really my type of game.
[375:40.00]But it just is fun.
[375:43.16]It's something about it.
[375:45.03]You know, the movement, it's all, you know, it's that movement I really like.
[375:48.14]Oh my god, speaking of, what have I, I tried to fucking, oh my god.
[375:57.05]Hey, making a good point for the game here right now.
[376:00.85]Yeah, uh, alright, alright, it's all good, whatever.
[376:11.98]Good.
[376:17.73]I think I can get in here and do this too.
[376:21.00]So there goes one.
[376:22.44]It's tan.
[376:23.02]I'm just gonna save it again.
[376:23.84]I think I can handle this.
[376:27.50]No, I can't.
[376:27.90]I don't have any confidence.
[376:32.27]Alright, well that gets tan out of here.
[376:36.59]You need to keep going this way.
[376:42.07]What's down here?
[376:42.77]I don't want to peek.
[376:45.62]Lizard warriors?
[376:47.08]I can get this stuff.
[376:48.19]I just need a pyro that can do it.
[376:51.37]You.
[376:52.53]Or you up here.
[376:53.41]One of you do it.
[376:55.51]One of you do something.
[376:56.97]Alright.
[376:59.13]Harpy hags.
[377:00.81]After I... You understand?
[377:07.32]Red just came through again.
[377:15.85]I don't know what my teammate is doing.
[377:22.53]Horde.
[377:23.99]Packpack few.
[377:27.87]I wonder if it's enough.
[377:41.89]There's a fort here, right?
[377:48.87]Fuck.
[377:49.47]There's no fort.
[377:52.15]I don't have a fort.
[377:53.03]Uh-oh.
[377:54.31]Might as well just walk out and fight him.
[377:58.03]He might not even come after me, though.
[378:03.59]And then I'm gonna make the stroll this way.
[378:06.69]Alright.
[378:07.29]From here, I'm taking...
[378:12.20]I'm taking these guys out to the right.
[378:15.86]I'm going for it.
[378:16.52]Let's just start the journey now.
[378:21.54]Or maybe I'm gonna... No, I'll meet... Where's my other dude?
[378:26.42]Yeah, you... We're gonna trade here.
[378:28.58]Trade places.
[378:29.26]You head into the... Into the castle.
[378:31.88]You're gonna head out this way.
[378:36.91]I gotta at least stop moving around, man.
[378:39.85]This is a decent force.
[378:44.81]What was I going to do here?
[378:46.26]No, I was down here.
[378:51.46]A town hall.
[378:52.00]Right, town hall.
[378:52.50]Town hall.
[378:52.74]Town hall.
[378:53.16]Town hall.
[378:53.48]Tomorrow.
[378:54.76]Tomorrow.
[378:55.12]Town hall tomorrow.
[378:59.65]Who's this?
[379:00.43]Oh, fuck.
[379:00.97]They caught me.
[379:01.47]Um...
[379:17.80]I could just retreat.
[379:22.74]Yeah, it's not worth it.
[379:25.30]I'm out.
[379:26.92]It's not worth it.
[379:29.00]That sucks so bad because he doesn't have anything.
[379:30.53]He had like five units.
[379:38.37]Keep going this way.
[379:41.61]I'm not going in there.
[379:49.01]Coward streamer.
[379:51.10]Tonight, yes.
[379:55.76]Let me go this way.
[380:02.37]My phone's ringing now.
[380:03.41]Hold on a second.
[380:05.33]What is happening in this household?
[380:25.40]Thank you.
[380:55.94]Okay, hi.
[380:59.58]We're under attack here.
[381:03.68]Okay, you know when you investigate?
[381:06.89]You're like, what's happening outside?
[381:07.97]You open up and there's nothing there.
[381:10.75]No, I had to let somebody in.
[381:11.73]I had to let somebody in.
[381:18.87]We're under attack.
[381:22.48]Imagine opening the door and you think somebody's out there.
[381:25.82]I go, like, the dog's barking.
[381:26.94]Let me, like... We're under attack!
[381:29.88]You swing the door open.
[381:30.74]You scream that outside.
[381:31.72]It's like a mailman.
[381:35.67]Hey, here's your mail.
[381:38.03]Oh, thanks.
[381:38.65]Thank you.
[381:43.13]So, let's go... Let me make it a big picture here.
[381:47.51]I need the big picture.
[381:54.86]No, you open the door and it's a knight in armor screaming, we're under attack.
[382:01.19]Uh, I would close the door.
[382:04.13]I'd close the door and I would just get the phone as fast as I could and dial Diamondman as fast as possible and be like, there's somebody out of their mind.
[382:11.56]And I think they're going to fucking come after me.
[382:15.74]You need to die.
[382:21.06]No, no, no, no, no.
[382:21.90]Do everything that you're supposed to do.
[382:24.64]Town Hall!
[382:25.76]Yes, Town Hall gives me money.
[382:29.60]Oh shit, you can't see.
[382:30.86]Now you can.
[382:42.77]That's what I wanted to do.
[382:43.47]I don't have any more leftover money.
[382:49.41]I guess I could buy a little bit of stuff, just in case somebody decides to come to the castle.
[382:54.15]You're over here.
[382:54.85]Alright, I gotta stop moving people around.
[382:59.15]You... come out.
[383:02.63]Is there anybody around here?
[383:03.85]I don't think there is.
[383:04.61]You're just gonna go into this fucking portal.
[383:08.60]Or should I leave him just to defend?
[383:10.02]You got a lot of people, though.
[383:14.54]Maybe not.
[383:15.18]Maybe not.
[383:15.82]I got a scout.
[383:16.68]I have somebody guarding here.
[383:17.68]I have... nobody in this one, but I have somebody about to be building up in here.
[383:26.57]Those fucking harpies.
[383:32.49]Yeah, go kill it.
[383:37.88]I think I can kill them, right?
[383:40.66]I'm just scum.
[383:42.56]I'm doing it again.
[383:51.60]Part two.
[383:55.12]I like shouldn't have even done this.
[383:59.01]But it is the other hero, so that's good.
[384:04.65]I'm gonna get slaughtered.
[384:05.43]I'll be alright.
[384:07.05]I ain't gonna move.
[384:31.38]Bunch up again, please.
[384:32.70]I hope you do.
[384:38.03]Bunch up down here.
[384:38.81]Oh, please, do it.
[384:39.59]Go right here.
[384:54.28]Can Gemma still run at 60 miles per hour?
[384:56.10]Yeah.
[384:58.71]I think so.
[385:00.39]Uh, I ain't gonna go in.
[385:01.43]Actually, yeah, I am.
[385:04.59]I'll go in on this one.
[385:05.46]This is going for the, uh, genie.
[385:21.83]Of course, do it again.
[385:23.83]By all means, just go twice.
[385:25.02]Fucking harpies.
[385:29.64]Alright, let's move in.
[385:44.63]One of these guys.
[385:48.13]So there is an artifact behind...
[385:52.02]I wonder what it is.
[385:52.80]I will do a single target move on you.
[385:59.21]I don't think it's necessary to do anything else.
[386:02.21]Like, for instance, we could do Ice Bolt on you.
[386:05.89]No, on you.
[386:10.92]Harpy's dead.
[386:11.66]This is going to be a decent experience.
[386:25.11]And I'll get the artifact behind.
[386:26.27]It should be good enough.
[386:27.65]At least I think it will.
[386:37.40]Save, save, save.
[386:38.60]1200 experience.
[386:39.62]1300.
[386:41.25]No level up, but I get this stuff.
[386:44.25]Spirit of Oppression.
[386:45.87]Can't get it yet, but you know what I mean.
[386:52.75]That was a plane taking off, apparently.
[387:00.53]We're under attack!
[387:02.73]Guys, like, flying around like a fucking plane.
[387:05.11]Yeah, it's a one-seater plane.
[387:19.52]Why am I still streaming?
[387:20.36]Have I lost my mind?
[387:21.36]What?
[387:22.10]It's only been like six and a half hours.
[387:24.16]It's not been that long.
[387:26.34]This is it.
[387:26.94]After this, this is it.
[387:28.66]I gotta get a victory here.
[387:29.54]Alright, there you are.
[387:34.29]We're good.
[387:35.43]Next day.
[387:39.05]I'm looking for a collapse from purple.
[387:41.71]Can I like just steal resources?
[387:43.27]Can I have resources?
[387:45.05]I can, right?
[387:45.45]We're on the same team.
[387:46.09]Can I like take money from you?
[387:55.20]Wait, why can... Am I using my money for this?
[388:11.01]Wait a minute.
[388:12.61]I can... make heroes and use them?
[388:18.64]From... Odd, okay, well...
[388:24.23]We have a lot of territory.
[388:27.11]2,000 seagulls saved, and that's when the command gets deleted.
[388:34.02]Command's gonna get deleted.
[388:36.30]Horde of sprites.
[388:38.54]Horde of gnolls.
[388:40.51]Just head through here.
[388:42.51]School of Magic.
[388:44.91]Plus one spell power.
[388:46.01]This is leading us down here, but is Pandora's box down here?
[388:55.90]What is it?
[388:58.20]Spirit of Oppression.
[388:59.90]This item negates all morale bonuses during combat for both you and your opponent.
[389:09.89]That is not that good.
[389:12.13]But I will take more of these air elementals.
[389:15.83]What about earth elementals?
[389:17.01]Lots of earth... Maybe they'll join me.
[389:22.68]You think it's a scenario where they'll join?
[389:49.43]I'm not gonna, come on.
[389:50.75]That's... Imp cash, though, that sounds good.
[389:56.57]What we got down here?
[390:00.23]I have, like, a fort here, right?
[390:01.77]Capital.
[390:02.19]Okay.
[390:04.67]I need a capital.
[390:06.58]Do I not have a capital yet?
[390:07.80]How the fuck have I not had a capital?
[390:11.04]City, I don't even have a city hall here.
[390:13.66]Alright, I need a... Fuck the city hall.
[390:24.55]Tan, orange, red?
[390:28.20]Who's left?
[390:38.79]Well, that's all.
[390:39.79]You screwed down there.
[390:42.31]This guy right here is so... Just, I can kill him if I really wanted to.
[390:53.17]Let's do an Ice Bolt.
[391:00.18]Kill'em is weak.
[391:12.39]I will after I do this.
[391:19.27]Ice Bolt.
[391:23.24]Fly on over here.
[391:34.20]Skeletons are just gonna be targets here.
[391:39.67]So he will kill him, they will kill them, and this guy will just walk around with a broken foot.
[391:51.07]Not a big deal.
[391:53.85]Spellpower plus one, advanced wisdom, or basic scouting.
[391:57.10]I'm going to say advanced wisdom.
[392:02.28]Which leads us to this imp cache.
[392:04.97]We're going to attack the imp.
[392:07.57]What do I have?
[392:09.97]What's even in there?
[392:14.73]I might not have enough to do this.
[392:15.79]I'm kind of too spread out and it's too thin.
[392:19.37]I'll try it though.
[392:20.23]Yeah, this is not bad.
[392:21.25]These guys are grosses.
[392:22.11]Let's do Ice Bolt on you.
[392:22.93]Yeah, they'll die in one hit.
[392:23.93]Or maybe two hits.
[392:45.68]We won't make it.
[392:54.31]So there'll be money in here probably, hopefully.
[392:57.11]Gamesters always win.
[392:57.99]So yeah, they kind of are.
[393:02.54]These Aerial Elementals are pretty good.
[393:15.74]This is a pretty good skeleton bait though.
[393:20.00]What, like 160?
[393:20.36]Something like that.
[393:23.85]Gives me a pretty decent amount.
[393:30.01]Let's kill this one. 2,008.
[393:47.27]Eagle Command there.
[393:47.95]Because it's being... Deleted.
[393:51.29]It's being... Deleted.
[393:57.90]When you hit the year.
[393:59.00]2,000 bucks and 4 Mercury.
[394:02.94]Pretty good.
[394:09.70]So I have explored that.
[394:11.46]I got the money.
[394:14.65]Okay, let's head back in here for now.
[394:17.11]No, I'm going to take you down.
[394:20.21]Five click of gold.
[394:25.84]Plus one spell power.
[394:26.88]What do I have for any people here?
[394:28.98]Yep.
[394:32.20]Don't engage.
[394:34.08]And take the free spell, whatever it is.
[394:36.10]Water walk.
[394:40.09]There's not really any water here.
[394:47.71]Oh, what does it do?
[394:50.45]Walk across bodies of water.
[394:52.17]Cool.
[394:54.27]I'm glad I came all the way down here for that.
[395:05.15]Alright, I got 8,000.
[395:11.32]City Hall needs marketplace, blacksmith...
[395:19.28]What else do I need here?
[395:21.64]Resource silo.
[395:22.70]One ore.
[395:23.08]I don't really need it.
[395:24.12]Upgrade the graveyard.
[395:26.23]Darkness.
[395:26.81]Alright.
[395:27.33]Black Knights.
[395:30.53]Black Knights are now available here.
[395:31.91]Recruit some.
[395:41.34]2012.
[395:41.40]We're almost at 2019.
[395:45.40]And then it's gone.
[395:47.52]It's getting deleted.
[395:57.79]I need 5,000 for this to be a city hall.
[396:01.79]I need a fort.
[396:02.49]I need to turn that into a fort first.
[396:04.54]You're kind of coming in here and taking all my shit.
[396:08.74]Who's in here?
[396:19.65]Lots, pack lots, several.
[396:26.63]This guy's dead.
[396:28.11]If he stays where he is.
[396:36.74]Someone's coming up here.
[396:37.56]I don't know where the fuck purple even went.
[396:49.17]You're killable.
[396:52.73]Oh my god.
[396:53.57]Just get out of here and kill him.
[397:03.82]He's so weak.
[397:08.02]Alright, I don't want them to retreat, so I need to get in a position where I can kill them both very quickly.
[397:23.58]Don't retreat.
[397:24.34]Okay, so let me think about this.
[397:26.39]If I... shoot this guy and he's dead, and then I...
[397:33.72]I'm gonna say, like, Magic Arrow.
[397:38.14]Should kill him.
[397:39.28]Or Magic Arrow on them.
[397:41.32]Health, 5.
[397:42.63]Health, 10.
[397:48.07]I'm gonna just be sure I'm gonna do Ice Bolt.
[397:56.98]Got it.
[397:58.98]What'd you have?
[398:01.02]Artifact.
[398:03.84]magic That was Tan was coming to try to take the castle because he didn't have anything Tan was essentially the guy out in the desert crawling in the sand I just fucking threw a dart at him
[398:35.07]I see a magic missile on him.
[398:36.69]Great.
[398:39.66]Well... I don't really know who's left.
[398:44.60]Purple has kind of gone up here and around.
[398:47.46]It's red and orange.
[398:52.32]I think I can wipe you out here, too.
[398:58.95]I think I can.
[399:01.19]Nobody in here.
[399:03.13]Look at all.
[399:03.49]I got so much money.
[399:07.88]I gotta get some people in here, because if he comes over... Let's collapse on him.
[399:24.84]But, like, fuck you.
[399:25.56]You're not taking all this stuff.
[399:26.86]This is all mine.
[399:30.84]There he goes.
[399:31.36]He's not going in the castle.
[399:35.88]Hurry, hurry!
[399:51.72]I don't need to hurry.
[399:53.38]You got 20-20.
[399:53.72]Oh, well, whatever.
[400:01.44]He ain't going in there.
[400:02.12]He'll die.
[400:04.21]He's got dogshit defense.
[400:05.83]There's a fort here, right?
[400:07.17]Yes.
[400:15.81]I think we're getting close to winning the game.
[400:20.44]I did a lot of work this time.
[400:23.36]A lot.
[400:26.94]I was making sure I was stopping people, I was conquering, I was attacking.
[400:30.81]Purple was just getting resources and running around in circles.
[400:35.59]I did a lot of work this time.
[400:38.39]To a point where I am very proud of what I've been able to accomplish here.
[401:01.17]Okay.
[401:09.53]Let's go and kill this guy.
[401:15.26]How many heads need to roll here?
[401:16.62]Can I do it?
[401:18.70]I'm going to be blocking the path, right?
[401:22.46]He can't go anywhere.
[401:25.58]Get him dead.
[401:26.22]Get him.
[401:26.50]Oh, I'm gone.
[401:32.56]Forget about these artifacts.
[401:35.67]I need to get up here and continue to win the game.
[401:42.27]Next day.
[401:47.21]Clean this guy out.
[401:50.46]Orange still has a bunch of shit.
[401:52.52]Whoa, whoa, whoa, orange is right up my front door.
[401:55.94]Where is this orange?
[401:59.98]Um, is purple being destroyed?
[402:08.35]How did you get here?
[402:17.57]What is he doing?
[402:25.84]Yeah, it's red and orange versus me and purple.
[402:28.14]That's who left.
[402:28.70]That's it.
[402:29.96]And he's just not doing anything.
[402:32.28]This is a decent force.
[402:35.44]Like, what are you doing up in the snow?
[402:36.91]You need to get down here.
[402:39.15]I'm getting swarmed by both of them at the same time.
[402:43.67]I can't kill them both.
[402:44.93]I can't do this both.
[402:53.78]I'm gonna die here.
[402:59.74]Well, we're gonna fireball.
[403:03.76]Can I get the other one?
[403:04.56]No.
[403:15.33]I've done a lot of work this game.
[403:24.61]Even when you're on your own, Ares still fucks you.
[403:35.05]We were supposed to be on the same damn team.
[403:40.43]That's definitely what he did the other game too.
[403:41.91]He just... avoiding all conflict somehow.
[403:52.61]I don't want a retreat scenario, so let me see here.
[403:56.31]Can I kill them all quickly here?
[404:01.28]He's gonna retreat.
[404:02.02]It's not gonna be enough.
[404:07.22]Here he goes.
[404:07.90]No, he's not leaving.
[404:08.72]Don't leave.
[404:11.35]Let me kill you.
[404:14.25]Come on, I still have plenty of people to do turns.
[404:17.88]Come on!
[404:43.84]I'm gonna lose this fucking castle up here.
[404:46.88]He's gonna take it for free.
[404:52.28]Purple's just scratching his ass.
[404:59.87]No, I can't go down there and take that.
[405:03.23]I can't.
[405:03.57]How do I get down?
[405:04.23]I gotta get down there somehow.
[405:06.39]It's through one of these portals, I think.
[405:07.89]Or through here.
[405:11.98]I didn't, like, do anything down here.
[405:13.18]I didn't have enough money.
[405:14.32]Ah, I think this is another loss.
[405:18.63]Did Orange take the Cyclops castle?
[405:22.85]Um... No, he's about to.
[405:27.55]Just head in here.
[405:28.71]I gotta refill some people.
[405:36.99]Hang out in there for a day.
[405:39.25]He's gonna take it.
[405:43.05]Where's Purple?
[405:46.29]There it is.
[405:46.80]He took it.
[405:49.04]He just killed Purple.
[405:50.38]Purple just died.
[405:51.30]One of his guys just died.
[405:55.30]He's got nothing.
[405:56.02]Purple is now worthless.
[406:02.85]Dude, like, can I just, like, come take these?
[406:04.83]I can't even... Can you deliver them to me?
[406:09.89]Just deliver them to me, please.
[406:11.25]Please.
[406:12.59]So I have a chance here.
[406:17.40]I could probably get... What do you have for enemies?
[406:20.02]Alright, here's what we're going to do.
[406:21.56]Are you ready for this?
[406:22.14]We're going to do a little consolidation here.
[406:34.35]Who has the best... Who's higher level?
[406:39.45]Level 9 versus level 1.
[406:42.55]Yeah, just give everybody to him.
[406:46.89]Pull out some more skeleton warriors.
[406:51.27]And let's just go kill him.
[406:52.72]Let's try to kill him.
[406:53.52]Take the castle back.
[406:56.88]He's right up here.
[407:02.62]I will win this fight.
[407:18.10]Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[407:18.91]That's a good idea.
[407:19.65]The butterflies are not worth having.
[407:24.43]Let's see.
[407:24.79]Is purple about to be deleted?
[407:27.47]And then I have to fight versus... Is it going to be 2v1?
[407:30.35]That's Ares right there.
[407:31.87]Where'd he go?
[407:37.36]Where's Ares?
[407:37.78]I just saw him.
[407:48.68]Where'd he go?
[407:55.63]Where'd he go?
[407:58.66]No, the gem
[408:20.66]And I'm gonna upgrade the butchers.
[408:28.99]It's just right here.
[408:44.10]Upgrade a graveyard.
[408:44.96]There we go.
[408:57.24]Alright, this is the force to take the stuff back and keep everything.
[409:01.42]Horde, horde.
[409:02.28]He's going for this castle.
[409:03.54]Let him do it.
[409:05.50]Let him go, die.
[409:11.92]He actually did it.
[409:12.48]Okay, so that's weak.
[409:15.53]Because those were, like, 10 or 15 Cyclopses.
[409:22.37]Yeah, I'm gonna take the box.
[409:23.67]Give me the box, give me the box.
[409:25.78]Give me the box.
[409:27.18]Several lots left.
[409:28.10]Give me the box.
[409:31.61]Open the box!
[409:38.65]10,000 experience.
[409:41.66]He didn't even care.
[409:42.58]Alright, expert earth magic.
[409:50.43]Expert wisdom.
[409:55.11]Expert necromancy.
[410:01.32]And anti-magic.
[410:04.10]Should I take it?
[410:04.64]Lots, lots.
[410:05.52]Horde.
[410:05.98]Pack several.
[410:07.06]I think I can do it.
[410:08.14]Does this... I don't think this has a... I did it.
[410:21.20]I got it.
[410:21.46]I'm gonna get it.
[410:26.15]Anti-magic.
[410:26.97]Protects the select unit from all spells.
[410:28.95]Now let's Meteor Shower right here.
[410:32.93]That'll hit.
[410:34.55]It'll be good down... Yeah, right here.
[410:37.51]It'll hit the three of it.
[410:40.28]Should kill that.
[410:41.66]Almost.
[410:42.18]Close enough.
[410:43.68]Alright, get fucking pumped up, boys and girls.
[410:45.68]Let's go.
[410:55.04]Target number one.
[410:56.36]Top and bottom.
[410:59.98]I'm on it.
[411:05.04]Roger that.
[411:21.77]No, this is priority now.
[411:26.26]Wow, that did a lot of damage!
[411:27.56]Wow!
[411:29.84]I'm so- I'm way too excited for this.
[411:43.63]You got a cool walking sound.
[411:50.97]Really?
[411:53.57]You guys can handle that.
[411:54.57]I'm gonna say, let's get up here.
[411:58.21]No.
[411:59.22]They're in the back line.
[412:00.14]Get rid of this.
[412:03.06]And heal that up.
[412:05.94]Skeletons, that's fine.
[412:08.00]You don't stand a chance.
[412:10.86]All right.
[412:11.52]I am gonna fly up here.
[412:14.16]I'm gonna take out the... I'm gonna try, at least.
[412:21.59]Get rid of this.
[412:27.88]Not bad.
[412:31.52]These liches do so much damage to the air.
[412:38.02]I own so much property over here, it's kind of ridiculous.
[412:47.21]Take out the Medusa.
[412:54.35]Ice Bolt.
[412:57.86]Just for fun, you know.
[412:58.98]Let's go.
[413:05.62]Heroes of Might and Monopoly.
[413:10.69]He hasn't retreated yet.
[413:13.03]He can't retreat.
[413:13.69]He's in the castle.
[413:15.27]Where are you going to retreat to?
[413:26.43]Nah, I just scared the shit out of myself.
[413:27.75]Can he run away?
[413:37.55]He didn't have anything.
[413:46.54]Advanced offense or basic tactics?
[413:51.74]Offense.
[413:54.76]I got it.
[413:55.93]I got the thing and I took over the castle.
[413:58.13]But it doesn't really matter if I get... You need to pull some weight here.
[414:05.01]Honest to God.
[414:07.30]You gotta start to pull weight.
[414:10.98]You're starting to get a little sloppy.
[414:16.86]Need a marketplace.
[414:27.24]I can't do everything purple.
[414:33.84]Okay, he actually took that.
[414:36.64]Come on, good.
[414:39.72]This doesn't have anything.
[414:40.76]Look at how fucking shitty this is.
[414:48.25]I need a town hall.
[414:49.87]I need a tavern.
[414:55.53]Might as well just get in.
[414:56.35]No, I don't even need to.
[415:01.61]Alright, next... We're gonna do... A mage guild.
[415:08.01]And then I'm gonna make this a town.
[415:12.92]What about over here?
[415:14.40]Power liches.
[415:15.26]Lots of power liches.
[415:16.16]There's artifacts over here, though.
[415:17.66]I'm gonna claim some of this stuff.
[415:22.14]Because I don't want you to have it.
[415:36.28]Purple coming in.
[415:38.60]Let's get this stuff back in our name.
[415:40.86]Artifact.
[415:46.76]Amulet of the Undertaker.
[415:49.10]Lots of power liches.
[415:50.22]Let's build that.
[415:55.62]City Hall.
[415:57.86]more income more income more income all right what we got well I think I could definitely take them I think lots of liches you're right here you're not that strong though
[416:33.07]You're not gonna be able to get it with what you have here.
[416:37.24]I highly doubt that.
[416:41.90]No, he doesn't have enough to attack.
[416:42.96]He has, like... He doesn't have any people.
[416:45.20]I could kill him with just, like, four Black Knights.
[416:49.67]Alright, I'm gonna go for it.
[416:55.01]I'm gonna go in.
[416:57.15]Power Liches.
[417:00.65]22.
[417:00.67]That's a lot, but this artifact... Hopefully the artifact's worth it.
[417:10.91]What are they immune to?
[417:12.05]What do they hypnotize?
[417:15.88]Won't affect anybody.
[417:19.88]No.
[417:20.42]Fireball.
[417:21.42]Meteor.
[417:24.98]Fireball's 75.
[417:25.54]I could just do Meteor.
[417:37.33]Forgetfulness.
[417:39.96]Half of the selected enemy unit forgets to use their ranged attack.
[417:43.38]Can't do it.
[417:47.46]I'm just going for damage.
[417:54.55]This is ranged, so it's gonna get in.
[418:07.98]Blind makes him unable to read.
[418:09.45]Yeah.
[418:10.05]This is already not off to a great start, but I hope that artifact is worth getting.
[418:28.74]Good.
[418:33.72]It's okay.
[418:35.70]Let's go with another... Let's go with Fireball.
[418:39.76]Meteor.
[418:39.96]I'm going to go back in the house anyways.
[418:42.36]Just do a bunch of damage.
[418:47.54]I'm going to lose a lot, but it's okay.
[418:58.27]We're almost actually at the end game, I think, here.
[419:05.68]What is it?
[419:07.00]Amulet of the Undertaker and the Golden Bow.
[419:09.58]Alright.
[419:16.15]What about the next?
[419:16.67]This amulet increases your necromancy skill by 5%.
[419:21.13]And then the Golden Bow.
[419:22.53]That's not that great.
[419:24.13]That's alright, I guess.
[419:28.58]He's not going to attack.
[419:30.95]They're just so all over the place.
[419:32.87]I'm gonna lose because purple's not fucking doing anything.
[419:36.65]Purple, they're all over here.
[419:40.48]What are you still doing up there, purple?
[419:43.68]Just get over here.
[419:44.74]Golden ball.
[419:53.17]When wielded, the golden ball allows your troops to shoot through any obstacle or at any range without penalty.
[419:59.19]That's actually incredible.
[420:06.04]That's fantastic, actually.
[420:11.26]Let's get back in here.
[420:17.61]All right.
[420:18.09]Did I do this?
[420:18.69]This is done.
[420:21.05]Capital.
[420:21.65]Cannot build a capital yet.
[420:24.33]I have... No, I need a capital.
[420:35.52]What should I make the capital?
[420:37.62]Probably this.
[420:39.40]Yeah.
[420:46.71]10,000 gold.
[420:47.03]That's the capital.
[420:47.73]I need a mage tower.
[420:51.83]Ah!
[421:03.03]Don't come over here.
[421:05.13]Soon 20 bone dragons.
[421:07.78]It's possible.
[421:14.66]Purple has entered the server.
[421:19.64]Here he is.
[421:20.06]Oh, great!
[421:24.05]You have five dwarves, nine riders, and 47, like, dirty, like, peasant people with pitchforks.
[421:41.23]Does anybody... You have to have a hero that has something, right?
[421:45.77]That's who you send all the way over here?
[421:48.17]He's probably coming over to look for food.
[421:52.80]Hey, we're on the same team.
[421:54.96]Could I, like, bum a couple of cigarettes off you?
[421:58.44]Oh, get out of here!
[422:00.04]Okay, see you later, man.
[422:05.76]This sucks.
[422:10.06]I'm just going to bring him down here.
[422:12.16]Sounds like I should build this up.
[422:22.20]Cliff nest, I guess.
[422:23.98]Let's build some of this.
[422:27.22]I can do the citadel, the capital up here in a minute.
[422:33.02]Imagine blaming your team in a single player game.
[422:35.32]Well, he hasn't done anything!
[422:37.55]He's just died.
[422:41.04]He's supposed to be really good.
[422:42.46]Oh, you took a castle.
[422:44.52]Good job.
[422:45.53]Take that one, too.
[422:46.69]Which castles did you take?
[422:52.15]He still has default enemies.
[422:56.05]Why is it... Dude, he's still got, like, default enemies.
[423:10.12]When I'm playing against him, he's impossible to overcome.
[423:15.06]When I play with him, he's still using default fucking vampires.
[423:22.65]I mean, I'm just so fucking upset about this.
[423:25.15]I'm so upset about these things.
[423:28.87]Well, it's time just to stockpile.
[423:34.89]I need to upgrade you guys.
[423:45.57]Not bad.
[423:51.65]I was supposed to turn this into a capital.
[424:00.69]See you next week!
[424:05.53]Good job.
[424:06.91]You did great.
[424:08.07]I'm very proud of you.
[424:09.57]You just... Nice work.
[424:11.89]I can't wait to get the inevitable purple has been deleted from the server.
[424:19.15]Gremlin population is double.
[424:20.67]They're just all over the place now.
[424:25.03]Okay Okay.
[424:27.29]4500.
[424:27.47]I need to start making other stuff too though.
[424:31.78]I need like a... The Hall of Darkness.
[424:35.48]I need a capital building!
[424:42.78]I'm going in here.
[424:43.50]When's the last time you saved the game?
[424:49.74]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[424:51.36]I'm so upset.
[424:52.05]I did I did not, I, for some reason, I don't, I don't... What the fuck did I do that for?
[425:03.25]It's okay, I can still do this.
[425:08.87]Health, they don't have very much health.
[425:14.47]I am going to Bloodlust.
[425:18.60]I don't have Bloodlust.
[425:24.33]Get some ties.
[425:26.53]That's not gonna gonna affect anybody?
[425:27.81]Holy shit, Hayden Klipfel just gave $115.
[425:34.65]Thank you so much for the 115 bucks.
[425:43.18]That's a ton of fucking money.
[425:49.47]Uh, they say, hello, goodnight.
[425:54.57]Thank you.
[425:56.09]That's an, insane amount of money, thank you so much.
[426:06.01]Thank you for the fucking 115.
[426:16.73]This is not as scary as I thought it was gonna be.
[426:19.37]Let's collapse This is not as scary as I thought it was gonna be.
[426:24.18]Let's collapse on the... Go forward.
[426:25.24]Yeah, this is not bad.
[426:25.88]This is gonna be fine.
[426:28.44]I was scared for a second.
[426:29.38]I don't know why.
[426:29.88]I keep thinking they're like dragons, but they're not.
[426:33.47]Let's go up here.
[426:47.19]Yeah, they're just griffins.
[426:49.25]These two can handle it.
[426:50.11]13.
[426:50.42]There.
[426:50.62]And this is probably gonna be it.
[426:53.38]I probably build a, uh... have, uh, griffins now, right?
[427:23.07]That's a good amount of experience.
[427:26.87]Expert offense or basic fire.
[427:28.61]I think think expert offense.
[427:37.00]Having defeated the Royal Griffins, you discover three angels.
[427:42.10]Oh, damn.
[427:44.92]I think I'm... Give up the basic skeletons.
[427:49.94]I wish I could just...
[427:54.46]The whites.
[428:17.79]What, the zombies?
[428:18.63]2 to 3, 20 health.
[428:20.27]3 to 5.
[428:20.55]Yeah.
[428:29.19]2-3, 20, 5-5.
[428:29.43]Yeah, the zombies are worse.
[428:35.73]Can they just stay there?
[428:36.62]That's a big waste.
[428:44.42]Ah, but that... I mean, this is a really big, powerful enemy.
[428:47.10]200 health.
[428:48.97]Three of them.
[428:54.23]I can get the zombies back.
[429:03.55]You see, I can get him back.
[429:07.45]Citadel!
[429:08.41]Don't do that.
[429:14.63]Angels are worth, like, 9k.
[429:15.89]42 zombies are worth, like, 5.5k.
[429:16.93]Yeah.
[429:20.66]Angels are a little out of place for this army.
[429:22.36]They'll be fine.
[429:24.60]Have you ever heard of, like, a shadow priest?
[429:28.14]We're gonna be just fine.
[429:29.02]We're gonna win.
[429:35.78]Can do the market.
[429:39.38]Where's my fucking market?
[429:46.05]Do I even have a fucking market?
[429:48.39]No, I need a capital.
[429:52.55]Let me get the capital first.
[429:53.75]It's just me against the world.
[430:11.67]Let me get a good look at your army.
[430:12.85]It's not that great.
[430:23.44]Army's really not that good.
[430:30.59]But, whatever.
[430:31.45]8500.
[430:32.23]Starting to lose the long game here.
[430:48.27]I just don't have enough money.
[430:53.15]Low morale ogres.
[430:54.85]I need to get out of the castle and just fucking... I need to start claiming shit back.
[431:03.87]This is my stuff.
[431:12.09]Capital.
[431:13.95]I'll get it now.
[431:31.28]Make this the capital, and then I'm good to go.
[431:33.70]No, I'm gonna stack.
[431:43.24]This is the guy that's gonna win.
[431:45.93]This is my mobile... destructive unit.
[431:51.03]Oh fuck, he's going for the other castle.
[431:56.85]Hey, you could blame this on me, but then I would blame this on Purple.
[431:59.97]And then Purple would blame it on... nothing, because he's not a person, he's not alive.
[432:31.48]Almost done.
[432:33.54]Who we got?
[432:34.04]Anybody near me?
[432:36.01]You're down here.
[432:36.71]I can defend this.
[432:42.73]This is gonna get this.
[432:43.53]I have a fort.
[432:46.76]I'm gonna sell some shit.
[432:49.08]I'm gonna at least have something here.
[433:07.04]Let's get some rocks.
[433:10.90]Now maybe you'll think twice.
[433:11.92]I bet you walk up the stairs one at a time.
[433:19.43]I'm sorry to be incorrect on that one.
[433:30.97]I'm gonna sell some more stuff.
[433:58.21]I mean, I have lost every time.
[434:00.75]But I've had a lot of fun doing it.
[434:03.29]I will say.
[434:03.75]I've had a lot of fun doing it.
[434:13.82]They're just stationing out here.
[434:15.16]They don't have very much, though.
[434:16.12]I could get rid of both of them.
[434:18.82]Lots, lots.
[434:19.92]Pack.
[434:20.48]They're just very spread out.
[434:21.50]I just need somebody to help me here.
[434:26.33]You're not going to take this.
[434:28.48]Not even close.
[434:29.42]It's not going to happen.
[434:39.18]I've got like an absurd army here.
[434:46.90]Alright, this is the last week.
[434:51.40]And now I'm going to go for the kill over here.
[434:53.26]I'm going to try to take the capital back up here.
[435:10.04]First, I wanna do this.
[435:11.16]Better Death Knights.
[435:21.07]I can't do it.
[435:22.25]One more week, and then I'm out.
[435:23.91]I'm gone.
[435:35.55]And then I'm gonna just chase people down and kill them.
[435:41.25]I'm turning into a hoarder.
[435:42.29]There's two people surrounding his castle.
[435:50.16]Here we go.
[435:55.06]Much better.
[435:56.68]Dread knights.
[435:59.22]I can get some more of these.
[436:02.86]I can get some more skeletons.
[436:04.82]Alright, I'm actually... I'm going to leave now.
[436:07.34]I'm going to bring the fairies too.
[436:09.78]Because I just want them to be bait.
[436:13.58]Let's take the kingdom back one at a time here.
[436:23.53]You down here.
[436:24.15]I want you to come out.
[436:25.23]A throng of swordsmen.
[436:30.21]Let's get over here.
[436:51.76]Get Bone Dragon, or I will be mildly disappointed.
[436:54.07]Don't worry, you won't be disappointed.
[436:56.13]Well, maybe you will.
[436:56.75]Because I might not get it.
[437:07.99]Not enough.
[437:08.71]Haha, that's not enough.
[437:15.31]Rock!
[437:24.51]Still alive.
[437:26.17]Uh, some treat back.
[437:27.63]He can't swing.
[437:32.23]That was a mistake.
[437:33.33]He can't, like, he's gonna get the dog.
[437:34.82]Okay, it's about the dwarf.
[437:42.76]Just get in there and maybe he'll swing at you.
[437:53.14]21, 18, 60 versus 18.
[437:58.92]Five.
[438:06.97]Everyone's surrounding you, I can't get in there.
[438:08.73]Alright, this should level him up.
[438:16.49]This is the first combat he's seen.
[438:22.73]Basic scholar.
[438:23.63]Basic heir.
[438:24.91]Probably heir.
[438:25.87]There's a campfire here.
[438:37.66]We'll get that later.
[438:40.58]I'm out for blood right now.
[438:42.38]Like, pure, total hatred and vengeance I'm going for.
[438:48.21]All their armories are not as good as mine.
[438:49.55]They're not as cool as mine.
[438:51.29]They're not as, like, handsome as my characters.
[438:54.62]They're not as smart as my characters.
[439:19.71]I'm not going to use a spell that's not even working.
[439:21.81]Why would I do that?
[439:25.74]It's unnecessary.
[439:26.56]We'll die in one hit.
[439:35.34]There was no... I didn't even need to do that.
[439:36.84]Alright.
[439:37.84]Claimed.
[439:39.24]Again.
[439:39.54]It's been claimed.
[439:41.96]Now, we're going to go up.
[439:44.44]Several, several, several...
[439:47.39]What about over here?
[439:48.21]Several.
[439:49.61]Right about here.
[439:50.27]Lots.
[439:50.67]Horde.
[439:51.05]Lots.
[439:51.53]Throng.
[439:54.47]Horde.
[439:54.89]We just gotta go straight up.
[440:06.04]It's now a fort.
[440:09.56]You.
[440:09.78]600 gold.
[440:13.99]Can you handle this?
[440:14.63]A throng of swordsmen?
[440:15.49]I don't think you can.
[440:27.98]Okay.
[440:30.43]Okay.
[440:33.01]What else can I do?
[440:33.59]I want a mage tower.
[440:36.03]Cover of darkness.
[440:37.87]No.
[440:40.32]Convert any creature into a skeleton.
[440:51.44]Firebirds.
[440:52.43]No.
[440:54.33]Just hang out here because they're going to come back.
[440:59.71]Just convert everybody to skeletons?
[441:01.15]That'd be insane.
[441:10.85]Yeah, tomorrow's going to suck.
[441:14.05]I'm not looking forward to tomorrow at all.
[441:15.81]Because I have to do the prep tomorrow.
[441:20.65]And it's absolutely unbearable.
[441:25.41]It's not going to be fun.
[441:27.49]So that's why you're not gonna see me for, like, a few days.
[441:30.65]So I got the prep tomorrow, I've got the procedure the next day, and then I'm probably gonna take another day after that, because I'm gonna be on a bunch of drugs the day before.
[441:41.38]Depending.
[441:41.84]We'll see.
[441:42.66]I'll keep you updated.
[441:46.34]Uh... Bye.
[441:49.28]How you doing?
[441:56.15]You good?
[441:58.20]I mean, you might as well just pick an extra one.
[442:00.69]You've been in here for a day.
[442:01.55]Let's go.
[442:03.17]Phew.
[442:04.01]Throng several lots, lots.
[442:14.98]This is going to be a tough one.
[442:17.76]He's got dragons, though.
[442:22.67]He's got a throng.
[442:23.89]I think I can do it.
[442:45.53]Let's go.
[442:46.33]He only has one dragon.
[442:51.80]It's fine with me.
[442:52.34]I'm going to kill this one dragon right now.
[442:55.56]With... Oh, man.
[442:58.18]Meteor Shower right here.
[442:59.24]And I'm going to kill... Watch this.
[443:00.73]Meteor Shower right in the middle.
[443:06.37]That was unbelievable.
[443:07.55]Then I can kill you with her.
[443:10.07]That was as perfect as it could have been.
[443:15.21]Retaliate.
[443:19.05]I want you... Yeah, the knights go this way.
[443:22.54]Take out the Manticore.
[443:26.64]Perfect.
[443:27.48]Both their strongest units are dead.
[443:32.36]Just go be bait up here.
[443:35.21]Perfect.
[443:37.43]And I'm going to have you get down this way.
[443:40.25]Take out the air.
[443:45.54]He fled.
[443:47.94]Damn it.
[443:48.32]Damn it.
[443:56.47]What about you, motherfucker?
[443:59.81]I'm coming for you.
[444:03.65]I'm going in that portal.
[444:05.07]I'm going in the fucking portal.
[444:05.97]I'm gonna go kill them.
[444:08.84]Check this out.
[444:09.46]I'm going straight in that portal.
[444:10.66]You think you can run from me?
[444:27.13]You can't run from me.
[444:30.66]I'm going to go take out Red.
[444:33.24]Hey, be right back.
[444:35.32]I'm going to go kill Red and wipe him off the map.
[444:49.17]Head back in there.
[444:56.51]Let's keep you upgrading.
[444:59.68]What do I do here?
[445:00.72]Citadel.
[445:06.62]Okay, you're starting to stack up a little.
[445:13.94]I'm gonna kill red.
[445:15.46]And then it's the two of us versus orange.
[445:19.04]We can handle it.
[445:20.06]Together.
[445:21.36]We can do this together.
[445:22.78]I just have to do my thing down here.
[445:29.92]Red does not have another base, I don't think.
[445:32.04]I think this is it.
[445:45.65]I could go up and just remove him.
[445:51.18]Yep.
[445:52.70]We're taking him out one by one.
[445:58.95]I want them to be... I want nobody to exist.
[446:06.81]I'm not going to use any spells I don't need to.
[446:08.13]This is pathetic.
[446:18.23]Just get in here.
[446:20.05]Even if they attack first, it doesn't matter.
[446:21.22]I've got to retaliate and kill them.
[446:33.65]I have got the burning of a thousand suns in my blood.
[446:39.34]I'm going to win this.
[446:42.44]Systematically, slowly.
[446:44.92]Yeah, bye.
[447:01.39]No!
[447:04.63]This actually might be pretty hard to win because, uh... My, like, shit-stained partner is not doing so well.
[447:39.72]He's doing the best he can.
[447:42.63]Yes.
[447:43.85]But it's going to be another scenario where I don't... Wait a minute, he just killed somebody.
[447:53.62]Here we go.
[448:09.40]I'm gonna Meteor Shower right here.
[448:11.02]That's gonna fuck them all up.
[448:19.25]Beautiful.
[448:20.67]Now let's go on the bottom here with the Angel.
[448:26.29]That was a mistake.
[448:28.40]That was what I wanted to do, so thanks for doing that.
[448:42.73]Open the door, please.
[448:52.97]Minimal casualties, too.
[448:55.13]I'll at least go out taking out red, and that's all I care about.
[448:57.63]Uh... I'm going in here.
[449:12.30]I'm going to give Bloodlust.
[449:15.38]And you're going to fly in and just kill this right now.
[449:33.65]What's left?
[449:34.07]What the hell is left?
[449:41.09]We're still alive.
[450:00.33]Okay, I didn't lose anything.
[450:05.68]Sorcery or ballistics?
[450:08.70]I think it's gonna be ballistics here.
[450:11.84]Thanks for the castle.
[450:12.92]I got 53 more skeletons.
[450:13.91]Oh, I didn't want to do that!
[450:28.92]I think that's their only castle.
[450:31.34]They have seven turns to come and get me.
[450:35.69]Good luck.
[450:40.87]They could try to take this one.
[450:46.12]Let's see what happens.
[451:01.54]No, Red has one more up here.
[451:06.88]You got three bo- you can get that.
[451:08.52]Three bone dragons.
[451:11.10]They have one more stronghold right there.
[451:14.59]Well, hold on a minute.
[451:15.47]Let me just, like, fucking park for a second.
[451:19.75]And, like, sap you with all your energy.
[451:22.25]Is this a... Is this a citadel?
[451:26.95]It's a... Alright, good.
[451:28.51]Castle.
[451:30.62]Oh yeah, give me that.
[451:40.89]Park here for now.
[451:46.39]I think I can do this.
[451:56.66]I wonder if I can come out here and just kill him.
[451:59.04]Phew, phew, phew.
[452:22.56]I gotta send the rock down here.
[452:24.08]Here he comes.
[452:25.58]Take him out.
[452:55.63]Come on, whack him!
[452:57.37]Whack him!
[452:59.65]Another hero done.
[453:00.73]I wonder if you will retreat.
[453:04.67]I hope you don't.
[453:10.71]I think you can still win.
[453:21.28]Delusional.
[453:25.74]Fucking delusional Dead and I got lightning bolt.
[453:34.75]I didn't have anything
[453:52.38]Advanced air magic allows you to cast air spells that reduce cost and refresh.
[453:55.20]Air magic.
[453:57.58]Alright, let's go back in here.
[454:02.86]Rest up.
[454:07.59]I've bought everything I can buy here.
[454:08.83]I might take you out and send you somewhere, but maybe not yet.
[454:12.97]This is unguarded.
[454:30.37]Protect purple?
[454:32.21]I mean, where's purple?
[454:33.73]Purple has one more place.
[454:37.38]Nothing in it.
[454:38.34]He has default enemies in here.
[454:41.66]I'm gonna lose.
[454:45.12]But, I mean, maybe I could at least look pretty good doing it, you know?
[454:59.57]If I can stack a ton of people, it might be... Of course, you just leave.
[455:06.70]Purple... Thanks.
[455:18.53]Oh, would you now?
[455:23.89]You would appreciate some gold.
[455:27.82]Is that what you want?
[455:34.71]He actually just came in and asked for a cigarette.
[455:42.83]Now what the hell are you gonna spend it on?
[455:47.12]No, I'm stacking somebody, man.
[455:49.82]Dragon Vault.
[455:52.64]It's done.
[455:55.14]I'm gonna have two stacks.
[455:57.41]I just got a stacker, like the BK stacker.
[455:59.23]He's dead.
[456:10.63]I'm gonna be so hungry.
[456:21.94]I'm gonna be so hungry.
[456:27.24]What time is it?
[456:27.74]11?
[456:29.02]Because I can't eat any food as of tomorrow.
[456:46.49]He tried to give me his rocks.
[456:47.69]I don't want his rocks.
[456:48.79]I want his support, and his fighting power, and his help.
[456:56.45]Yeah, colonoscopy is on Saturday, so... I can't eat any food a day before, and it's in the morning.
[457:04.17]So I have the... My, like, last meal is gonna be tonight.
[457:10.91]So I actually have to go here soon.
[457:13.95]Within the next, like, 40 minutes.
[457:21.77]Because I need to be able to eat something before tomorrow.
[457:26.35]But I'm not out yet.
[457:27.43]I can't.
[457:36.57]Bone dragon.
[457:41.47]I just need 15 grand.
[458:04.83]Almost at 15 grand.
[458:05.87]I'm gonna sell some stuff.
[458:10.17]No, I don't need to.
[458:11.37]More.
[458:11.55]I don't need to have the super bone dragons.
[458:18.78]Three regular bone dragons is good.
[458:23.54]Because guess who I'm sending back up there?
[458:29.29]Me.
[458:35.71]I'm gonna wrap around this way.
[458:36.87]Hoard.
[458:38.51]Several pack few.
[458:40.08]I don't know if I want to fight this.
[458:50.40]Give me this castle.
[459:20.75]Fuck the resources.
[459:22.65]Just trying to get bone dragons.
[459:28.01]He just got the Pandora's box.
[459:29.54]That's not good.
[459:31.70]See, I'm getting encroachment here.
[459:36.68]Take that red castle right now.
[459:39.84]Get this red castle.
[459:41.04]You keep coming over here.
[460:14.24]Down here.
[460:15.76]Do I have Earthquake?
[460:18.56]I have Meteor Shower.
[460:19.34]I also have Clone.
[460:20.96]Oh.
[460:21.02]That's more like a... Fire Armageddon!
[460:22.58]Brains fire down upon the battlefield, damaging all units.
[460:42.05]I don't think I want to hurt everybody.
[460:44.33]It's not time for Armageddon.
[460:46.97]Meteor Shower.
[460:48.81]Get this stack right in the middle.
[460:56.90]I'm going to kill myself with Armageddon.
[461:01.42]Can't get everybody yet.
[461:03.29]He might come out and meet me in the middle.
[461:04.99]With his dragon, he will.
[461:08.85]End it.
[461:12.37]perfect now they have one ranged there we go these are just regular vampires there's nothing to be afraid of
[461:40.37]Get units that are not affected by magic and use it.
[461:44.83]We're at the end game here.
[461:48.29]I'm trying to cycle back around to load up again on units.
[461:52.88]And then have an unstoppable force and just run around the whole map and kill everyone.
[462:09.50]Let's just get in here.
[462:11.79]Blocked it.
[462:19.77]The castle is ours.
[462:31.46]Inexhaustible Cart of Ore.
[462:33.08]When equipped, this cart provides you with an additional one ore per day.
[462:37.13]And I got Dispel.
[462:39.44]Advanced Ballistics.
[462:41.98]Yeah.
[462:45.30]Thank you for the castle.
[462:47.21]Too bad you don't have any goddamn bone dragons in here.
[462:50.41]Are these advanced bone dragons or are these regular bone dragons?
[462:57.91]Alright, hold on.
[463:00.03]Now I wrap up.
[463:01.14]Let's go this way then.
[463:03.76]I got two of these castles.
[463:08.50]I'm going this way.
[463:11.46]I'll take you all out.
[463:17.58]I can't waste any time here.
[463:21.56]Purple's right here with three dwarves.
[463:27.12]Forget about the resources.
[463:28.10]I just have to go.
[463:28.86]I've got a great army.
[463:36.57]No one's taking this shit back from me.
[463:48.33]Alright, you wanna try?
[463:51.47]You really wanna try this?
[464:05.46]Slow.
[464:07.00]Blind.
[464:09.00]Blind.
[464:10.76]To... To you.
[464:13.68]On the rocks.
[464:14.80]Can't do it on the bird.
[464:19.46]Now that, he can't move now.
[464:27.43]He's not gonna get it.
[464:31.61]He's fucked.
[464:38.07]Damn it, that wasn't it.
[464:39.93]That sucks.
[464:43.97]That's all they got though.
[464:49.63]This is not that intimidating.
[464:57.11]I mean, they'll breach eventually here.
[465:12.27]I can't do it anymore.
[465:12.97]That's it.
[465:13.93]I can't do it anymore.
[465:18.29]Back up this way so people don't get stuffed in the corner.
[465:20.33]Alright, I think I'm flying the dragon over.
[465:26.43]No.
[465:27.33]No.
[465:27.51]I don't think so.
[465:43.06]Yeah, I'm just going to use ranged on... Just get rid of... The towers are taking care of you.
[465:50.96]On the air.
[465:52.34]It does a ton of damage to the air.
[465:55.15]Ooh, that hurts.
[465:55.89]I think it's time I got to get out.
[466:01.85]I can't just sit here all day.
[466:02.71]He's going to do that again.
[466:03.35]Is that the first time with the unicorn?
[466:08.74]No.
[466:08.84]No.
[466:22.80]They can't get in.
[466:24.92]They're getting hurt by the spikes.
[466:27.36]We're going to kill him eventually here.
[466:30.98]Maybe one more.
[466:31.72]Alright.
[466:33.20]Gates are going to be breached?
[466:34.56]Not quite.
[466:49.71]No.
[466:49.87]They're going to just keep hurting themselves.
[466:56.19]What the fuck just happened?
[467:02.65]What was that?
[467:06.17]Destroy undead?
[467:08.87]You are undead!
[467:15.10]Hold.
[467:16.96]Just hold.
[467:19.74]Hold.
[467:35.77]Is it open?
[467:36.21]I don't think it's open yet.
[467:47.74]It is open, isn't it?
[467:50.50]Hold the wall!
[468:00.97]Hold the wall Hold the wall Hold the wall Hold the wall Hold the wall Hold the wall
[468:34.67]Oh my god, this can't be!
[468:38.57]I should have just went out!
[468:40.95]I didn't think he was gonna be... It's over, I lost.
[468:43.82]I did it fucking twice.
[468:45.16]I just lost.
[468:45.60]I can't believe it.
[468:47.06]I should have just ran out and not held.
[468:49.94]That's what I should have done.
[468:51.92]That's what I should have done.
[468:55.21]I should have just fucking left and got out and started attacking.
[469:03.62]And everybody would have screamed at me if I went out.
[469:05.62]But you see what happens?
[469:06.72]I would have won.
[469:26.04]I would have won.
[469:39.48]Did I save?
[469:39.96]Oh, it don't matter.
[469:41.02]Orange has the entire map.
[469:43.75]Purple was fucking walking in circles for the first two hours of the game.
[470:12.72]I just lose.
[470:13.04]If I was supposed to retreat... I don't have Armageddon on this guy.
[470:20.75]It's a different character.
[470:55.64]Save scum?
[470:56.22]No, I actually have to leave here.
[470:58.38]I have to, like, kind of clean this up and get out of here.
[471:01.63]Because I am going to severely fuck up the next three days if I do not.
[471:14.92]If I don't eat before, like, 1230, 1 o'clock in the morning tonight, it's gonna be... I might actually, like, starve.
[471:31.49]That would not be a good thing.
[471:39.10]He's got so many, but I still might be able to... Is there anything else up here?
[471:42.96]I got that one.
[471:45.12]Purple's is there.
[471:46.02]That's mine.
[471:46.78]That's his now.
[471:49.62]I'm gonna try to take this.
[471:54.55]I've got a lot of money, so... Here, let's stock up on you.
[472:02.42]Doesn't make nobody even in here.
[472:03.82]It's kind of a lost cause at the moment, to be honest.
[472:08.40]Spend some money.
[472:10.32]Make this the new fucking capital.
[472:12.56]Get a new hero in there, too.
[472:38.72]He just came into my house.
[472:40.12]Does he even have one left?
[472:42.38]He's like, I guess I'll stop in yours.
[472:44.16]That sounds fun.
[472:46.74]Alright, this is... This is like the big fight here.
[472:49.44]Because... This... This is gonna be it.
[472:53.70]This is gonna be the one.
[472:56.27]We got...
[473:09.05]okay who's back there meteor shower they're really bunched up right here that didn't hit the did not hit you that's weird did I just break it I think I might have just broken it oh magic resistance what was that air shield
[473:42.01]My priority is gonna be the archers here.
[473:46.13]Let's fly up this way.
[473:49.51]And you're gonna have to eventually get down here.
[473:57.14]Yeah, that's not good.
[473:57.94]We gotta get in there.
[474:00.62]That was a pretty big hit.
[474:19.99]Alright, well, okay.
[474:22.19]I really want to fight.
[474:23.27]I want to bring the whole fight.
[474:26.01]Uh, same deal down here.
[474:34.07]Double it up.
[474:35.14]Nice.
[474:35.64]Perfect.
[474:36.28]It's open.
[474:36.62]I want bloodlust on you.
[474:56.88]That was a huge heal.
[474:59.20]All right, you take out this last one here.
[475:01.46]Let's get everybody into the wall now.
[475:09.38]Get right up in there.
[475:10.56]You should be able to get this last hit.
[475:17.16]If you walked right into 224 skeletons, that was a bad idea.
[475:22.60]What the hell was that?
[475:25.05]He teleports to people?
[475:33.64]Leave the dwarves alone.
[475:35.34]Oh.
[475:36.56]Poor dwarf.
[475:38.80]Not like it matters.
[475:43.08]It's already open.
[475:45.90]Oh, he killed that one.
[475:51.71]Alright.
[475:52.01]Dwarves, we're gonna... No, we have to deal with this.
[475:58.15]I wanna do...
[476:00.66]Second level lightning bolt, anti-magic, landmine, ice bolt.
[476:08.40]I'm probably just going to do fireball up here.
[476:10.00]Are you magic resistant?
[476:13.28]Yeah.
[476:14.04]Aura of magic resistance.
[476:18.55]Might be just lightning bolt.
[476:20.71]I don't know why I just did that.
[476:26.13]I just went Australian for a minute.
[476:29.93]I think you're the threat here.
[476:31.53]Take down the centaurs.
[476:46.86]Should be good to go.
[476:50.30]Don't go after the unicorn yet.
[477:04.14]Good.
[477:05.62]Come as a unicorn.
[477:09.72]Walk into the path as the... Yep, yep, yep.
[477:14.48]There's seven of you.
[477:19.48]Get out of my way.
[477:31.83]Suicide Dwarf.
[477:33.17]Pretty good battle.
[478:03.98]Seagulls are growing stronger Alright, I'm gonna get this castle
[478:19.47]Sword of Hellfire.
[478:21.75]This right-hand weapon increases your attack skill by plus six.
[478:26.47]And Sacrifice.
[478:30.57]Holy shit.
[478:33.65]What is Sacrifice?
[478:34.65]Who cares about the one ore?
[478:39.26]I already know Lightning Bolt.
[478:47.73]No, I don't care about the ore.
[478:48.99]Alright, what does this do?
[478:53.21]Sacrifice.
[478:53.87]Jesus.
[478:58.32]Alright, this was a big deal.
[479:24.13]There's no more towns up here.
[479:35.34]Are you gonna get this?
[479:40.34]Go get it!
[479:42.02]Go get that town!
[479:43.17]That's Red's last town!

[494:08.06]This game is really fucking fun and addicting.
[494:11.48]I'll probably do it again.
[494:12.30]We'll probably complete that one and then move on to another game.
[494:17.76]It's probably what will happen.
[494:19.49]Uh... The next time you will see me will probably be on... Sunday?
[494:26.09]Or either Sunday or Monday, maybe?
[494:31.64]One, two... Yeah, I would assume you'll probably see me on Monday.

[494:38.12]Uh, I'm a little nervous.
[494:38.96]I actually can't aim.
[494:39.98]I am a little nervous.
[494:42.37]Just because there's a couple of reasons why, there's a couple of things... You know, you have to go get put under, it takes like 30 minutes of them going all inside of your body and your guts and shit, so... I've done something similar like it before, so... Thanks everybody for watching.
[495:05.41]We actually don't have very many bits, so this is not going to take very long.
[495:08.11]So I'm going to go through them right now, we're not going to take any time.
[495:12.35]We had, uh, eight hours ago.
[495:15.09]God, these Might and Magic streams just are so long.
[495:19.22]Uh, thank you Germalight about Taco Bell for the $2.50.
[495:22.88]If you need some energy, Germa, just eat a Gordita Crunchwrap Deluxe from Taco Bell.
[495:27.04]I'm just kidding around, Germa.
[495:28.04]I know there's really high, uh, there's a really high morality with this kind of procedure, so I hope you know we're all pulling for you on this one.
[495:36.21]Yeah, I, it's, I'm just going in to get a couple things looked at.
[495:40.88]Eating Taco Bell before a colonoscopy.
[495:42.78]I would have to reschedule it.
[495:46.22]There are certain... Imagine.
[495:49.02]What did you eat yesterday?
[495:50.30]Oh, I had some water, three cheesy gordita crunches, and two Big Macs.
[495:56.38]Okay, well, come back next week and don't do that again.
[496:03.03]But thank you so much.
[496:03.77]Thank you, Epoxy.
[496:04.57]$47 from Epoxy.
[496:07.61]This was way earlier in the stream.
[496:10.27]I didn't catch it.
[496:11.13]It was 47 fucking dollars, just shy of 50 bucks.
[496:14.01]It's a lot.
[496:16.85]Hey, Jeremy, today's my brother's birthday, and him and I both love your content.
[496:19.69]It would mean a lot if you wished him happy birthday.
[496:24.15]Absolutely.
[496:25.67]I don't know what your brother's name is, but happy birthday, Epoxy's brother.
[496:31.92]Hopefully it's still your birthday.
[496:33.50]And if it's not, then happy birthday after your birthday.
[496:35.69]You deserve two.
[496:36.55]You should get two birthdays.
[496:42.51]Thank you so much, Epoxy, if you're still here.
[496:44.25]And happy birthday to your brother.
[496:45.74]Hope you guys had a good day.
[496:47.44]Hope you had a lot of fun.
[496:49.04]Hope you got him something nice.
[496:49.98]Hope you got him something nice.
[496:54.20]Thank you for the $47.
[496:56.55]I really appreciate it.
[496:58.57]Freudian Weapon, thanks for the 250.
[497:00.05]Good luck with the procedure.
[497:01.31]Thank you.
[497:01.63]I appreciate it.
[497:02.07]Thank you so much.
[497:04.89]I get weirdly nervous before procedures, and then it's weird because I... Two days before the procedure, I'm, like, really nervous.
[497:11.98]And then when I get in the doctor's office, I'm like, ah, I don't care.
[497:14.48]Whatever.
[497:15.98]It's just like the two days before.
[497:20.27]But thank you.
[497:20.71]Spicy Pepe, thanks for the 250.
[497:22.09]Hey, Germa, I hope you're doing well.
[497:24.05]The streams have been great.
[497:25.09]I have really enjoyed them.
[497:26.44]I still think you're the best human, and if chat wants to disagree with me on that, just remember it's okay to be incorrect, chat.
[497:33.54]Thank you.
[497:34.99]Yes.
[497:35.49]If I'm not at E3, I don't have any plans to be, but we might last minute decide that we're going to go.
[497:49.54]If not, then I will do an E3 breakdown stream.
[497:52.64]You will get it.
[497:54.00]I will do those streams again.
[497:55.20]They were fun.
[497:56.80]You will get it again.
[498:01.84]Thank you so much for the 250.
[498:05.18]Smellyboy, thanks for 250.
[498:06.50]If you were able to have this much fun playing a game like this, Civilization is a total... Totally a viable game of choice.
[498:13.49]Civ 5 or 6?
[498:14.35]I feel like Civilization is a little more complicated than this.
[498:20.94]Am I wrong in that?
[498:22.18]Is Civ 4 or Civ 5... Aren't they a little more... Don't they take a lot longer and they're a little more complicated?
[498:30.29]Can't a Civilization game last, like, 50 hours?
[498:36.12]Five is super easy.
[498:42.14]Heroes of Might and Magic's a little more chill.
[498:43.76]Ah!
[498:46.60]Yeah, I think it's just I have this predisposed bias just because of how much I love these games and how much when I was, like, a young kind of teenager I played them.
[498:56.14]The game came out, I think, when I was, like, 14 or 15 or something.
[498:59.93]And I played the other ones before, too.
[499:01.11]I played, like, Heroes of Might and Magic 2.
[499:02.40]There's a lot of them.
[499:04.60]There's, like, seven of them.
[499:06.46]And 3 is really the best one by a general consensus.
[499:11.28]3 is the best one by a margin, I think.
[499:16.99]That was 14, yeah?
[499:18.37]Yeah.
[499:20.27]I love it.
[499:20.59]I think it's great.
[499:23.65]But Civilization, maybe.
[499:24.95]I don't know.
[499:25.77]Probably not, though.
[499:26.83]I don't think it's that kind of game that I would like to play.
[499:29.51]Neither was this, but I'm biased.
[499:33.01]Also, 250 from Era Paradox, goodbye and good morning.
[499:36.55]Good morning and goodbye to you, too.
[499:39.91]Thank you for the 250.
[499:42.54]Let's get those credits rolling.
[499:45.42]Thank you to all the subs.
[499:47.54]All the shitload of you that support this stream every single time.

[499:51.62]Thank you, everybody.
[499:55.76]You guys rock.
[499:57.22]I know these last couple streams have been a little more kind of longer and more about like kind of video game and chiller and not like a whole bunch of crazy stuff going on, but I hope you liked it.
[500:09.47]I loved it.
[500:12.39]And I'll see you guys real soon.
[500:13.55]Thank you so much for your subscriptions.
[500:18.96]Fred Flintstone.
[500:19.82]I just thought of the thing again.
[500:23.44]I just thought of the thing again.
[500:26.71]I just read fucking Flintstone.
[500:28.66]What the hell?
[500:31.20]Uh, thank you to... The Polar Pair for the $5, not $2.50.

[501:54.70]Thank you so much for your $5.
[502:00.50]You guys are awesome.
[502:02.46]I'm going to do... I think... Is it stream legends time?
[502:05.16]Or how much time do we have left to stream legends?
[502:10.40]Sorry I had to cut us off at the end there.
[502:12.36]I just... I have... There are things I need to prepare for.
[502:16.04]I wish I could have finished that.
[502:17.82]It would have taken probably like another hour though.
[502:19.16]2127.
[502:26.37]What year are we going to end at?
[502:32.01]Seven minutes until I can do stream legends.
[502:35.10]Oh god.
[502:38.58]Really?
[502:38.86]Let me see.
[502:51.55]I lost every game.
[502:53.37]I was really getting into that last one there just because.
[502:58.84]I started to come back and you just get lost in a game like that.
[503:02.20]You just... It's so much fun.
[503:06.26]Let's see.
[503:06.68]Stream legends.
[503:15.62]I don't understand what it is lately.
[503:16.86]My extensions don't load anymore.
[503:19.18]My extension dashboard.
[503:20.43]I might have to refresh these.
[503:21.61]Yeah, six and a half minutes.
[503:30.70]No stream, Legends.
[503:31.68]Six minutes.
[503:34.84]No.
[503:35.32]I promise with 100% certainty.
[503:38.88]I promise.
[503:40.66]100% certainty that I will come back in six minutes and I will press that button.
