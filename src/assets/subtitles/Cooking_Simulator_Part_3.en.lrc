[01:28.08]What the hell?
[01:37.30]Joe Video.
[01:38.74]I don't understand what's going on here, by the way.
[01:40.70]Let me be really, really clear.
[01:43.06]I made a Thanksgiving, Happy Thanksgiving video last night.
[01:47.44]And people all lost their minds.
[01:49.05]I have no idea what's going on.
[01:51.95]I just said, hey, Happy Thanksgiving.
[01:53.31]I just, I don't do, I wanted to do more tweets.
[01:55.75]I wanted to get more stuff out there.
[01:57.45]People say tweet more, give us more updates and shit, so.
[02:02.75]I don't know people that that that tweet has been seen like three million times I don't understand why I don't get I just like this that was for you guys whatever it's because of what Vinny saw it by the way yeah I know I also heard that there was a a little bit of debate of how much that was gonna shave off the debt
[02:34.47]I wasn't even doing that to shave dead off.
[02:36.25]I did it because I felt like doing it.
[02:40.17]None.
[02:44.98]None.
[02:47.60]I was going to play Sly Cooper today, but that didn't end up happening.
[02:51.32]I bought it for the PS3.
[02:54.32]And I noticed that I started downloading Sly Cooper and the Thievius Racoonius, whatever it's, whatever the name of the, I don't know, whatever it is.
[03:02.64]So I leave the room.
[03:03.60]I come back after like 15, 20 minutes.
[03:06.36]And my room just smells like burning plastic.
[03:09.21]Just burnt plastic.
[03:11.91]It was disgusting.
[03:12.81]And I remember talking about this before.
[03:14.71]I brought this up.
[03:15.37]I was like, why does it smell like burning plastic?
[03:16.89]Remember that?
[03:18.03]On Saw 2, right?
[03:21.41]This is not the first time this has happened.
[03:23.64]But it was way worse this time.
[03:27.64]It was gas.
[03:30.12]Well, it was bad.
[03:31.20]It wasn't very good.
[03:34.28]So, I'm like, I don't want to smell this all day.
[03:37.83]No, we're not doing that.
[03:38.83]So, I was like, maybe I'll do an emulator or something.
[03:43.41]And I tried it.
[03:44.21]I couldn't get the emulator to do what I wanted.
[03:46.15]Didn't like the way it looked.
[03:47.91]So, Sly Cooper's going back in the bag for like another week.
[03:50.54]I don't know.
[03:52.20]I'm sorry.
[03:52.68]I know so many people wanted that.
[03:54.26]They were like, oh, I can't wait for Sly Cooper, dude.
[03:57.64]Sorry, my PlayStation 3 was burning.
[04:02.30]So we're gonna pivot.
[04:03.46]We're gonna play Cooking Simulator today.
[04:05.04]Uh, specifically the pizza update.
[04:09.37]I made sure to eat a lot of food before this stream.
[04:15.68]Do it on PS Now.
[04:17.56]No, PS Now is, no.
[04:20.66]PS Now, remember I tried to do Red Dead on PS Now?
[04:23.84]It doesn't, it's not, I don't want to stream through PS Now.
[04:28.65]It kind of looks like not very good.
[04:30.41]Because it already gets compressed and then I compress it again.
[04:33.33]And there's a little bit of input lag too on PS Now, which I don't, I'm not going to play a platformer with like a quarter second input delay.
[04:45.08]Are we gonna see Bugleberry today?
[04:47.50]Why would Bugleberry be here today?
[04:52.75]Stop streaming, please, in 720p.
[04:54.58]Your streams look so low quality.
[04:58.59]I know I'm wait I'm gonna do that I'm gonna do 900p what I needed a 3080 I need a i7 99 000 k whatever it is or i9 oh no we're going amd I forgot I'm gonna get a risen like thread ripper 64 core monster pc
[05:25.61]He's going AMD, Omega Low.
[05:26.89]Yeah, AMD has surpassed Intel in technology, from what I've been told.
[05:36.32]I've been told that AMD is rocking it right now.
[05:41.44]How true is that?
[05:42.04]I don't know.
[05:44.15]Why is this monitor so close?
[05:46.35]Get away from me.
[05:51.38]Okay, I don't know why.
[05:52.08]Did somebody just say, just watch the AMD CPU video on YouTube?
[05:59.09]Like, this is the ending of a video game?
[06:02.77]Did I read that correctly?
[06:04.01]Dude, oh yeah, dude, just watch the AMD CPU on YouTube.
[06:11.38]Oh, okay, I guess that is the same.
[06:16.94]Alright, it's pizza time.
[06:21.54]I had to mute this because this has just been going on for... I can't turn this off.
[06:28.65]My desktop audio has been at zero for the last 10 straight minutes.
[06:35.89]Yeah, it's pizza time.
[06:36.59]We're going to talk a lot about pizza today.
[06:41.24]My favorite pizza, your favorite pizza.
[06:44.30]What is my favorite pizza?
[06:45.38]You guys already know that.
[06:46.86]Do you know what it is?
[06:48.64]Do you know?
[06:48.98]I hope you do.
[06:52.37]It is a thin crust pepperoni pizza with no bullshit.
[06:58.52]That's it.
[06:59.94]Thin crust, crispy, crunchy, delicious.
[07:03.80]That's based.
[07:06.48]That's boring.
[07:09.05]I don't like a bunch of stuff on my pizza because it weighs the pizza down.
[07:12.83]And then, alright, hold on.
[07:13.63]I got to turn this down.
[07:14.47]Like, I could take my headphones out.
[07:21.92]Uh, so, I don't like when toppings weigh pizza down.
[07:28.18]I don't.
[07:32.11]I only like one or two toppings per pizza.
[07:34.89]And they gotta be light.
[07:37.69]Alright, bring it back.
[07:40.52]That's boring.
[07:41.34]No, why is it boring?
[07:42.98]It's like, I want sausage, eggs, peppers, onions.
[07:48.30]No, I want a croissant, eggs, and cheese on my pizza.
[07:50.81]I want a croissant with pizza.
[07:52.41]Like, what are you talking about, dude?
[07:53.71]Don't order that.
[07:54.47]What are you doing?
[07:59.87]No, I like simple pizzas.
[08:03.37]Peppers and onions.
[08:04.65]Sounds good.
[08:05.77]Pepperoni.
[08:06.81]Sounds good.
[08:08.80]Garlic and onion.
[08:10.08]You got me.
[08:10.49]I'm on board.
[08:13.19]Pie.
[08:15.33]I almost just wrote, but I said the word.
[08:19.05]Pie.
[08:21.33]No.
[08:21.51]Sorry.
[08:22.40]When are you going to do a pizza tier list?
[08:27.24]Today.
[08:27.52]I don't know.
[08:28.44]In half an hour?
[08:28.92]Alright.
[08:30.86]Let's go.
[08:31.24]Pizza simulator.
[08:35.36]I will try pineapple on pizza the correct way.
[08:38.51]I've been told I've been eating it wrong, and I'm willing to go for it.
[08:42.16]I'm willing to try it.
[08:52.46]New order.
[08:52.96]Margarita.
[08:54.28]Press T. Hello and welcome to Papa Pepe's Pizzeria.
[08:58.45]I see great promise in you.
[09:00.25]So much so that I'd like to share some of my secrets.
[09:03.33]And if you prove yourself, I may even let you run this pizzeria.
[09:05.77]Your training begins... Imagine, like, going to work for Coca-Cola and, like, Mr. Coca-Cola walks up to you, the CEO.
[09:11.31]Oh, you're the new hire.
[09:11.99]Yeah, that's a good handshake.
[09:13.33]The secret is fucking... It's castor oil.
[09:16.95]What?
[09:17.83]You're gonna do really good here, kid.
[09:26.67]Okay, let's go.
[09:27.97]I'm sure you already know this, but let's cover some basics.
[09:29.67]I'll show you how to assemble a pizza from already... Alright, let me see if I know how to do this.
[09:34.50]Bake it in the oven and finally serve it.
[09:36.46]Why... It's so bright in here.
[09:41.40]Is my... Why is the music getting louder?
[09:45.04]Yes, and put on your company pizza headphones while you're working.
[09:56.69]Name and address?
[09:57.71]What do you want my name and address for?
[10:00.29]What the hell is this here for?
[10:01.51]What?
[10:03.37]Okay, 60 FOV.
[10:05.17]Yeah, right.
[10:10.61]Okay, that... Why does this feel way worse now?
[10:15.93]Name and address?
[10:17.31]Why does it want your address?
[10:18.49]That's fucked up.
[10:21.02]Okay, here we go.
[10:23.25]Let's begin with a base for our pizza.
[10:24.50]They can't be pizza without it.
[10:25.42]To make a base, you'll have to roll out the pizza dough.
[10:27.36]Get some dough and place it on the bakeboard.
[10:29.44]Dough.
[10:30.98]Okay.
[10:31.22]Alright, place the Neapolitan-style dough on the bakeboard.
[10:39.75]We're going to roll this out.
[10:40.75]Okay, enter the creation view by pressing on the lump of dough.
[10:48.55]Okay.
[10:49.41]This is where you can roll out the dough and decorate it with ingredients.
[10:52.53]You can have up to three pizza bases at the same time on the bakeboard.
[10:56.01]Use A and D to switch between lumps of dough or pizza bases.
[11:01.05]So, you use to roll the dough.
[11:02.57]That looks pretty good.
[11:08.68]Oh, no, what?
[11:09.18]I don't want edges.
[11:11.22]Okay, W to switch to the GN container view shelf.
[11:15.44]You'll find some ingredients and some sauce that I've prepared for you.
[11:17.70]In the future, you'll have to prepare the ingredients yourself.
[11:21.34]Okay.
[11:22.36]So this is the shelf where you keep all the pizza ingredients.
[11:26.30]No edges.
[11:27.04]I like a thin crust.
[11:28.46]I don't like the big... I like a thin crust.
[11:31.82]This is too big and bulky.
[11:34.86]Make a stuffed crust.
[11:35.50]If you can make a stuffed crust, I'll do it.
[11:36.72]Okay.
[11:39.24]A and D to switch between ingredients.
[11:42.03]Right.
[11:42.29]Okay.
[11:42.47]Okay.
[11:44.21]Remember, you can only use the ingredients that have been stored in a GN container beforehand and slotted into the shelf.
[11:49.84]Use to choose the sauce.
[11:52.34]Nice.
[11:53.02]Oh, yes.
[11:54.16]This looks small.
[11:56.24]Now click on the pizza base to pour the sauce on it.
[11:58.46]Then move while holding to spread the sauce around the surface.
[12:03.52]I've seen the Pizza Hut training video from 1985.
[12:05.99]I know how to do this.
[12:07.61]Oops.
[12:11.91]Oops.
[12:21.89]Oh, there we go.
[12:22.47]Okay.
[12:26.01]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[12:26.99]You stop at the edges.
[12:27.75]You don't go any further.
[12:28.47]But wait, I need to get a little bit of that crust.
[12:33.09]Oh, shit.
[12:33.87]I did it too much.
[12:37.71]Looks like a coiled up turd.
[12:40.17]Okay, now to add some cheese.
[12:47.22]Ow, shit.
[12:49.00]Somebody said, stop dragging the ladle.
[12:52.27]I'm alright.
[12:52.79]Everybody relax.
[12:55.81]Okay, that's enough.
[12:56.33]Now time to add some cheese.
[12:57.27]It has to be placed evenly so we can cover the whole surface of our pizza when it melts.
[13:00.31]Remember that you can use Q and E to rotate the cheese slices.
[13:05.12]Really?
[13:05.44]Is this cheese?
[13:10.28]Okay.
[13:11.78]We can rotate.
[13:16.81]And this is gonna... I actually prefer when it's shredded.
[13:23.31]Okay, that's it.
[13:24.83]Finish.
[13:25.07]Add some basil leaves.
[13:29.33]Oh, okay.
[13:29.73]Here's the herbs.
[13:32.36]Alright, now just put it on there.
[13:35.98]What?
[13:38.50]Use to place basil leaves on the pizza on the template.
[13:40.68]Okay.
[13:40.80]Alright.
[13:46.07]Alright.
[13:48.29]Now we have to bake it.
[13:49.29]A pizza is ready to put in the oven.
[13:50.21]However, the oven needs to be prepared to fire up the oven and place a log inside the firebox.
[13:56.36]How do I get out of here?
[14:01.00]Wait, we have to actually feed the fire?
[14:02.56]Alright, oven.
[14:08.48]Okay, before we can start baking, the oven needs to reach the optimal temperature.
[14:11.91]You can check the temperature using the thermometer on the left side of the oven.
[14:17.39]As time progresses, the oven will slowly run out of fuel.
[14:19.57]Make sure to add logs from time to time to keep the fire going.
[14:27.00]Get it in there.
[14:27.40]Alright, get it in the green.
[14:30.98]How much wood does it take?
[14:31.75]A wood-fired pizza?
[14:37.35]Yeah, that's the best.
[14:40.66]Okay.
[14:42.00]Now let's shove the pizza into the oven, but don't try to do it with your bare hands.
[14:45.74]Oh.
[14:46.86]Okay, I need to pick up the pizza peel.
[14:53.02]No, that's not a pizza peel.
[14:55.10]Get rid of that.
[14:59.72]Whatever.
[15:00.62]Okay, where's the pizza peel?
[15:01.74]Oh, that thing.
[15:04.75]Precise handling of tools in the kitchen is crucial.
[15:06.47]Holding out shift will open up new ways to manipulate whatever you are currently holding in your hand.
[15:12.50]Oops.
[15:12.74]Alright, let's get it.
[15:18.53]Alright, I got it.
[15:20.13]And we put it inside of here.
[15:27.07]Slide it in.
[15:31.61]Alright, then we just let it sit in here, right?
[15:33.33]Pay attention.
[15:35.25]If it's too low, add logs.
[15:36.61]If it's too high, close the chamber.
[15:38.01]Alright.
[15:39.05]Alright.
[15:43.19]Oh, I need to add logs.
[15:48.21]What if I know if it's done?
[15:51.94]I never understood this shit because you can't even see in there.
[15:53.88]You know what I mean?
[15:56.00]I can't see in there.
[15:56.78]There needs to be a camera pointing down inside of these ovens.
[16:02.28]Okay, it's hot.
[16:02.86]Nice and hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
[16:07.60]Okay, give me the tool.
[16:12.77]And it's ready.
[16:15.71]Get it.
[16:19.27]Take out the pizza.
[16:20.07]Oh, that looks pretty good.

[22:20.05]Let's go back for a moment to the Quest Villa app.
[22:23.37]Bring up the smartphone's main screen once more and click on the app icon.
[22:26.50]Don't worry, the recipe is going to stay pinned.
[22:27.74]Okay, the Quest Villa.
[22:31.28]Quest Villa is an application dedicated to the elite world-class pizzialio- pizzilios.
[22:37.88]Pizzalios.
[22:38.62]Is that a Warcraft zone?

[22:46.20]Here you'll find some challenges.
[22:53.78]It's a battle pass.
[22:56.60]It really is a battle pass.
[22:59.39]It was a bad joke.
[23:00.23]Oh, I'm not trying to make a good joke.
[23:01.61]I was just trying to make a wow reference because I get to.
[23:06.95]Jerma bought Shadowlands.
[23:08.05]Time that guy up.
[23:08.63]I don't want to hear him.
[23:10.94]Here you find some challenges and tasks that allow you to improve your skills and gain new abilities.
[23:14.84]Battle Pass.
[23:16.54]Completing these quests will grant you fame, respect, and skill certifications.
[23:21.95]Okay.
[23:22.81]I need to learn how to do dough first.
[23:24.33]We're not getting involved in this.
[23:27.65]Hide him, hide him, hide him.
[23:29.11]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[23:32.98]I will grant you the title of Novice Pizzialio.
[23:36.07]How do you even say that word?
[23:36.97]I'll let you run the pizzeria by yourself.
[23:40.13]Additionally, by completing tasks from the app, you'll unlock new recipes and ingredients, so it's well worth the effort.
[23:44.29]Okay.
[23:48.27]At the bottom of the screen, you'll see a key that describes the elements of the app.
[23:52.70]After you familiarize with the app, press tab to put the smartphone down.
[23:57.06]Okay.
[24:00.30]Quest progression.
[24:01.26]I just want to make a pizza.
[24:04.30]Okay.
[24:08.50]Necessary ingredients and tools.
[24:11.30]So I need flour, water, sugar, salt, oil, garlic, butter, and baking soda.
[24:21.14]I don't know.
[24:21.50]Whatever it is.
[24:23.49]Before you turn on the machine, you must add the ingredients to the machine's bowl.
[24:26.99]Let's start with flour.
[24:27.95]You'll find it on the shelf behind you.
[24:29.81]One bag of flour should be enough.
[24:33.51]Try not to go bankrupt.
[24:35.47]Everything in the kitchen costs money.
[24:36.71]Plates, products, especially repairs.
[24:38.78]Don't take more than you need and keep an eye on your balance.
[24:42.52]You're out of business if you run out of money.
[24:44.56]Alright, let's dump it in there.
[24:45.40]How much do we need?
[24:47.38]3.5 kilograms.
[24:50.73]Alright, add to the bowl.
[24:56.91]Holy shit, how much did I just put in?
[24:59.95]Oh.
[25:03.71]I thought I put in a lot more than I needed to.
[25:06.91]Alright.
[25:07.25]Easy, easy, easy.
[25:08.47]Easy.
[25:14.49]Come on.
[25:14.89]Do it.
[25:15.13]3.5.
[25:15.44]Yes.
[25:15.52]Okay.
[25:15.68]Put this away.
[25:25.08]Now, flour is very important.
[25:26.76]Dough and grape.
[25:27.16]But it's not the only one.
[25:27.84]You'll find the rest in the box.
[25:29.70]Buy them and add proper amounts of each.
[25:35.29]In the box?
[25:38.80]You'll find the rest in the box.
[25:49.08]What box?
[25:49.54]Oh.
[25:52.25]Okay, yeast.
[25:52.87]What do I need?
[25:55.37]I need liquid.
[25:59.39]I need water.
[25:59.97]Okay, how much water should I buy?
[26:02.79]A lot?
[26:04.74]Okay, I need water.
[26:06.55]Salt.
[26:09.33]Water, salt, and yeast.
[26:15.05]Buy it.
[26:15.39]Okay.
[26:20.19]Use piss.
[26:21.91]We're not even 10 minutes into the game.
[26:24.49]Just hold that thought.
[26:27.33]What was it?
[26:27.65]Water, yeast, and what?
[26:30.92]What was it?
[26:31.24]Water, yeast, and what?
[26:32.20]Salt.
[26:33.04]Salt.
[26:39.09]Okay, so now we have to put in, I can't see what the, I can't, I want to see the recipe.
[26:43.91]Okay, salt.
[26:45.58]It's 2.4 liquid milliliters of water.
[27:00.41]What?
[27:01.59]That's all that's in here?
[27:11.85]Why is this, that's only one liter of water?
[27:13.96]Oh, goddammit, come on.
[27:25.98]How many, why don't I have a bigger, would you use the sink?
[27:30.95]I could, yeah, but that, that's low quality.
[27:34.09]I need to use, I'm not gonna use tap water.
[27:39.57]I'm using bottled water.
[27:40.77]That's the secret recipe.
[27:43.37]You're in Europe, though.
[27:44.75]Oh!
[27:45.09]Oh, okay.
[27:45.49]Yeah, yeah.
[27:45.89]The water's clean here.
[27:46.77]Is there water in this?
[28:11.81]No, how am I not even... I don't even have a bottle I can put this in.
[28:17.94]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[28:19.26]I already paid for this.
[28:20.10]Whatever.
[28:20.42]2.4.
[28:25.80]Good.
[28:29.99]It's okay.
[28:31.29]Alright, now we need salt.
[28:32.77]How much salt do we need?
[28:33.51]I don't... We need... 125 grams of salt.
[28:38.22]When preparing sauces and doughs, we often use a lot of spices.
[28:40.52]That's why our shakers are equipped with double action covers.
[28:43.78]You can pour 1 gram or 10 grams of spice with a single shake.
[28:49.55]Alright, so I want 10 grams.
[28:50.71]125 grams.
[28:54.25]Done.
[28:54.37]Bingo.
[28:54.49]Yeast.
[29:07.44]Yeah, it's just like a cube.
[29:10.20]Okay, this is 10 grams.
[29:11.48]Just put it in.
[29:18.50]Now mix it up.
[29:21.72]Oh, this is my favorite part.
[29:22.64]This is my favorite part.
[29:25.02]Alright, now ready.
[29:25.62]Be careful now.
[29:26.32]Do not press the red button.
[29:27.80]It will clear the bowl of its stored ingredients.
[29:30.52]Use it only if you make a mistake when preparing the dough from the recipe or you've accidentally dropped something in the bowl and can't remove it.
[29:40.15]No, chat.
[29:40.73]Chat, I'm not going to press the button.
[29:41.69]I'm not going to press the big red button.
[29:42.95]No, chat, I'm not going to do it.
[29:49.74]There's the green button.
[29:56.80]Nice.
[29:57.20]Okay.
[29:58.16]Let's discuss sauces.
[29:59.42]Sauce recipes are located in the same app as the dough recipes.
[30:01.88]Just navigate to the sauces tab and we'll make classic marinara.
[30:04.88]Okay.
[30:10.07]sauces marinara what was that just throw a rock at the restaurant let's pin this okay quest tab okay okay okay what do we have here we need some fresh vegetables time for a trip to the pantry

[30:47.85]These little bread poops.
[30:49.93]Okay, hold on.
[30:56.16]Pick up the basket.
[30:56.92]Gather 16 tomatoes.
[30:59.38]That's a lot.
[31:00.54]Four garlic, and then go back upstairs.
[31:08.27]Okay.
[31:08.67]16 tomatoes.
[31:29.18]OK.
[31:32.84]Holy shit, it's a 3D tomato.
[31:36.56]Now how do we do this?
[31:41.60]No, no, no, easy, easy.
[31:46.68]Alright, now what?
[31:51.03]Before you place the basket's contents into the cooking processor, make sure you have the right ingredients in the correct amounts.
[31:56.28]After you fill the cooking processor, you will not be able to remove anything from it.
[31:59.22]What's the cooking processor?
[32:06.26]Okay.
[32:08.13]Dump it in there.
[32:13.57]I need olive oil.
[32:16.31]Where do I get olive oil?
[32:23.74]just fill it up from the sink no it has to be oil okay how about 200 milliliters of olive oil where the ingredients go oh that comes out fast it's okay it's gonna be it's gonna be a little oily salt okay salt oregano basil and garlic salt oregano basil and garlic
[32:50.46]Down the basket, look at it.
[32:51.26]You should see a list of contents.
[32:52.40]If you notice something that you shouldn't be there, take it out.
[32:54.16]Okay, here's basil.
[33:01.99]You still need olive oil, herbs, and spices.
[33:04.13]You'll find herbs in the herbarium.
[33:06.71]Since we're preparing almost two liters of sauce, we'll need a lot of sprig.
[33:09.19]Okay, so we need... How many sprigs of basil?
[33:17.30]30 grams.
[33:18.70]Alright.
[33:19.60]Put it in there.
[33:21.08]Alright.
[33:21.98]Salt.

[33:46.35]Come on.
[33:48.83]Where's the oregano?
[33:51.55]Get it from the sink.
[33:56.10]The herbarium.

[34:21.67]One, two, three, four, five.
[34:23.97]Alright, let's blend it up.
[34:25.51]I can't wait to make my secret fucking sauce because I have no idea.
[34:32.23]We need to insert a GN container?
[34:35.37]Except for the dough mixer, all machines require an empty GN container to be inserted before they can be activated.
[34:41.69]Take one of the empty GN containers that you find lying around the kitchen and insert it into the cooking process as a dump chamber.
[34:48.26]Mm-hmm.
[34:50.87]Okay.
[34:56.27]Turn it on.
[35:00.97]That sounded like it hung up a little.
[35:02.03]Okay, we don't need any more recipes.
[35:04.95]Unpin them.
[35:06.85]Okay.
[35:10.46]It's going to take some time.
[35:12.20]Don't stand idly by here.
[35:13.68]Pick up the basket.
[35:15.48]And let's go back to the pantry.
[35:25.16]Okay.
[35:28.74]Where's the green line leading me to?
[35:30.40]Over here?
[35:30.68]Alright.
[35:32.78]I need olives, corn, salami, white onion, mozzarella.
[35:36.32]Is that good?
[35:37.58]Okay, mozzarella.
[35:45.10]White onion.
[35:51.04]Salami.
[35:51.18]Salami.
[35:54.70]Sweet corn Olives Where's the sweet corn?
[36:03.29]Where's the sweet corn?
[36:08.51]Where's the sweet corn?
[36:13.40]I thought that was a big thing of cheese Garlic?
[36:20.40]Where's the sweet corn?
[36:22.25]I don't see this anywhere
[36:29.86]Do I just keep glazing over it?
[36:36.10]Corn?
[36:37.55]Onion?
[36:39.31]It's right there.
[36:41.43]Where is it?
[36:46.47]You just did it again.
[36:47.15]It's on the shelf?
[36:49.49]Oh, I'm looking for ears of corn.
[36:53.09]I'm not looking for canned corn.
[36:54.45]I'm looking for ears of corn.
[37:06.96]He's throwing.
[37:08.40]No, I'm not.
[37:09.64]No!
[37:11.02]No, stand back up.
[37:13.96]Okay, the saw should be ready.
[37:15.00]Let's see what it looks like.
[37:18.47]Ooh, it looks like raw meatloaf.
[37:26.13]What do you want me to do over here?
[37:31.11]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[37:31.99]This is... Oh, this is from the other side.
[37:36.63]That's how they do this?
[37:37.73]Wow, I didn't know that.
[37:38.73]Okay, pick up the salami.
[37:45.92]So just put the salami over there.
[37:51.40]Put the salami into the cutter.
[37:53.78]Cool.
[37:54.14]Alright, turn on the salami cutter.
[38:05.12]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[38:07.72]Use this one.
[38:16.75]God, I wish that was me.
[38:18.83]The salami cut.
[38:20.17]You want your salami to be cut in the salami cutter?
[38:26.90]What the fuck are you talking about?
[38:35.83]God, I wish that was me.
[38:38.61]Somebody, uh... Somebody... No, you know what?
[38:41.29]Time that guy out.
[38:44.09]Okay, into the cheese grater.
[38:45.54]Into the salami cutter.
[38:54.02]What the fuck?
[38:57.62]Alright, turn it on.
[38:58.40]Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on.
[39:04.77]We're gonna have our grated cheese.
[39:07.55]Nice.
[39:08.91]Nice mealworms.
[39:13.82]Pick up an onion.
[39:15.84]One onion.
[39:18.10]Chop it up.
[39:22.36]Oh, shit.
[39:22.74]I need... I'm gonna... What?
[39:31.13]What?
[39:34.90]I'm in the onions.
[39:37.32]Look at the basket.
[39:39.40]Shit.
[39:42.92]Wait, wait, wait.
[39:43.52]I didn't... Is this a jar of pickles?
[39:49.36]I... Wait, wait, wait.
[39:51.16]I lost.
[39:51.64]I lost the... Game thinks I did this already, but I hit the red button.
[40:03.44]Alright, here's another trick.
[40:04.12]Put an ingredient into the automatic cutter.
[40:05.84]All ingredients of the same type in your basket will also get thrown into the machine.
[40:10.72]Oh.
[40:12.60]Whatever.
[40:16.11]Okay, alright.
[40:16.55]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[40:17.11]I need to... Okay.
[40:28.75]Pick up the basket with the ingredients.
[40:31.37]While holding the basket, use on the automatic cutter.
[40:38.30]Oh.
[40:39.54]Save a lot of time and trouble with cutting large quantities.
[40:42.90]I'll turn it on.
[40:48.01]Wait, I need to... I'm going to have to buy like a thousand of these.
[40:54.61]Okay.
[41:10.27]Wait, take this back.
[41:11.33]Give me this.
[41:22.93]I can't get rid of the onions?
[41:28.22]Pick up a can of sweet corn.
[41:29.38]No, I have to get rid of these.
[41:30.44]How do I get rid of this?
[41:47.83]Okay, there we go.
[41:48.37]Pick up sweet corn.
[41:51.76]While holding the can, use it on the container.
[41:53.32]Okay.
[41:57.46]Cool.
[42:00.14]Insert the GN container with sweet corn into the GN container shelf.
[42:03.14]Okay.
[42:08.77]Hover over the jar of black olives.
[42:11.93]Try not to throw up while you do that.
[42:17.27]Okay.
[42:18.61]From left to right, the icon... Wait, put this... Okay, from left to right, the icon represents dough mixer, cooking processor, electric grater, automatic cutter, and GN container.
[42:29.90]The last icon means that the ingredient can be stored directly into a GN container without the need for any further processing.
[42:37.03]Insert a GN container with 500 grams of black olives cut into the GN container shelf.
[42:58.07]Shit.
[42:59.13]Okay.
[42:59.29]Now we need a GN container.
[43:06.98]Chop them up.
[43:08.46]Put it into the GN container shelf.
[43:18.26]Very cool.
[43:21.48]Pick up a dough tray with click.
[43:26.37]Alright.
[43:27.88]Follow the green line.
[43:28.80]Alright, now we can prepare our dough for the day.
[43:34.34]Don't do it.
[43:34.82]Don't do it.
[43:35.24]Don't waste time.
[43:38.31]Pull the GN container shelf back into the yellow room.
[43:42.59]Hey, look at that.
[43:43.23]There's all my stuff.
[43:48.27]Go to the marked area.
[43:55.30]Oh, that's it.
[43:55.74]Alright, let's finish this up.
[44:01.51]That's not what I wanted to do.
[44:02.27]I was trying to drink it.
[44:18.72]Are you throwing glass at people?
[44:20.22]There's nobody out here.
[44:20.90]There's no trash can.
[44:29.57]Yes, there is.
[44:33.13]Well, whatever.
[44:34.03]I'm prepared.
[44:42.14]Alright, how do we do it?
[44:44.34]Click on the clock.
[44:48.52]Oh, what time is it?
[44:49.28]I don't know.
[44:54.08]Call an ambulance.
[44:54.86]I'm bleeding.

[46:01.10]Way less screen time.
[46:04.57]I have a screen time thing now on my app.
[46:06.95]And it's like, holy shit, I look at this phone like for three hours a day.
[46:11.61]That's way too much.
[46:12.91]Put it down.
[46:13.25]I'm going to try to cut back.
[46:21.77]That's a -2.
[46:22.63]That's not a joke.
[46:23.87]That is a public service announcement to put your phone down.
[46:27.97]Okay, each star can be bronze, silver, or gold quality.
[46:30.55]Depending on how well you prepare the pizza.
[46:32.98]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:34.24]Okay.
[46:36.76]The timer starts the moment you accept the order.
[46:39.28]If you manage to complete it within 30 minutes, you'll earn a bronze star, or else it's free.
[46:44.74]10 minutes?
[46:45.52]It feels like I can do that pretty easily.
[46:49.73]While you're still learning...
[46:52.02]Do not worry about the time.
[46:53.02]Alright, well, whatever.
[46:54.88]Just give me a fucking order.
[46:58.63]What is it?
[47:04.11]Orders can be accepted for only half an hour since the new day starts, but the guests won't leave until they receive their pizzas, even if that means waiting.
[47:12.08]So wait, if you order a pizza from this window at like 11 o'clock in the morning or 12 o'clock in the afternoon, and you don't get it till like 10 o'clock at night,
[47:21.79]I feel like you'd complain about that.
[47:23.45]That's not okay.
[47:26.41]This pizzeria is really busy, so don't worry about running out of orders.
[47:29.12]It's never happened.
[47:30.04]Okay.
[47:35.06]Okay, let's go.
[47:37.48]New order.
[47:38.06]A pugilist.
[47:40.98]Your first order.
[47:41.72]Launch the Bella Pizza app and check it out.
[47:46.60]Pugilist.
[47:49.49]The timer's already running.
[47:51.76]Okay, a pugilist is a medium pizza.
[47:54.14]It's a Neapolitan style.
[47:55.64]Hold on, I gotta read this.
[47:59.60]It's about how much of those the client wants.
[48:01.16]Sometimes some of those categories will be blank.
[48:03.94]That means that a customer does not want cheese on their pizza if it's blank.
[48:10.56]Alright, let's go.
[48:14.29]The arrow buttons next to the dough and sauce type will switch your view to their recipes.
[48:18.93]Fortunately, we prepared everything we needed yesterday, so we don't need recipes.
[48:23.24]Okay, yeah, I already made marinara.
[48:24.16]I already have Neapolitan-style dough.
[48:27.36]That's a lot to remember, but you can pin the order.
[48:29.34]Yeah, yeah, okay.
[48:30.18]Like, will you fuck off, Chef Boyardee?
[48:33.23]I'm busy.
[48:37.13]We start with the dough, and as you might have noticed, the order specifies the pizza size.
[48:41.59]That was rude.
[48:44.39]You won't leave me alone.
[48:45.30]I'm trying to run a pizza place.
[48:47.82]You're rude to tutorial guy.
[48:54.35]He's helping.
[48:55.75]I just want to make my pizzas.
[49:01.67]You need him.
[49:03.39]I don't need him.
[49:06.81]Toxic streamer.
[49:08.15]I'm not toxic.
[49:09.09]I'm not.
[49:09.55]No.
[49:09.81]Turn that toxicity down.
[49:13.23]He invented the pizza.
[49:14.51]I got a timer running.
[49:15.41]I got a timer running.
[49:16.11]I got to go.
[49:17.87]Okay.
[49:18.13]Where's my dough?
[49:18.57]Where's my dough?
[49:18.95]Where's my dough?
[49:19.35]Where's my dough?
[49:24.87]Hover over a large lump of dough.
[49:26.37]Where's my d- Okay, press Q while hovering.
[49:32.62]Press Q. What?
[49:36.10]No, this is large.
[49:36.94]Oh shit, this is too big.
[49:38.54]Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[49:42.40]Okay.
[49:43.98]Q, you can split it.
[49:47.23]The order requires you to make a medium-sized pizza.
[49:49.25]Combining two small lumps will give you a medium dough lump.
[49:56.22]okay let's go roll into a medium-sized pan pizza okay he's well baked to achieve a gold star alright customers usually do not like dry sauceless pizza why would I serve sauceless dry pizza those are crackers
[50:29.21]yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay good cool sauce marinara how much marinara do you want well this is how much you're getting really bad place for a save point okay good good good good good alright that looks good the cheese writing consists of three factors saltiness creaminess and uh suppleness
[50:58.37]Don't worry, if you lose a little too much cheese, the customers will be happy either way.
[51:00.81]Whatever.
[51:01.03]As long as they don't go bankrupt.
[51:05.33]Sure.
[51:06.97]When you shove the pizza in the oven, the cheese will begin to melt.
[51:09.23]Customers expect that the whole surface of the pizza will be covered by melted cheese.
[51:12.35]Okay.
[51:14.63]What kind of cheese do you want?
[51:18.81]Alright, mozzarella.
[51:19.43]You want cut mozzarella?
[51:22.11]How much mozzarella do you want?
[51:23.69]100 grams?
[51:24.13]How many do I have?
[51:24.55]What do I have in my hand right now? 20.
[51:40.47]There.
[51:41.83]Now you're going to be really happy when you eat this pizza.
[51:47.09]Okay.
[51:51.62]This is just how they serve food at the Disney resorts.
[51:58.30]Spread out evenly on the pizza.
[51:59.74]Maintain the proper quantity of each ingredient.
[52:01.40]You'll find this information in the details.
[52:04.57]The final score is a value based on the quantity and the distribution of each ingredient.
[52:08.83]The better you fail, the better the star you'll get.
[52:11.51]Let's start with the onion slices.
[52:12.65]Some ingredients are too small or used in such large quantities that the exact placement doesn't matter.
[52:18.09]Instead, we just scatter handfuls onto the pizza.
[52:20.05]Okay.
[52:22.26]Onions.
[52:25.26]What the fuck?
[52:28.32]Top the pizza with 32 grams of white onions?
[52:31.30]Is that...
[52:37.75]Alright, that's 32.
[52:38.59]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[52:42.03]Decorate the pizza with some olives.
[52:44.33]Olives.
[52:55.02]Is it going on the pizza?
[52:56.76]Oh, shit.
[52:57.28]Okay.
[53:04.36]Gross, gross, gross.
[53:05.62]They look like Oreos.
[53:08.41]Now we have to bake it.
[53:11.64]All that's left... Raw pizza with solid chunks of cheese will be rated poorly, but burned pizza won't steal any hearts either.
[53:16.94]It's best to prepare a plate for the pizza.
[53:20.98]Take on from the stack.
[53:22.17]The pizza size is medium, so we need a medium plate.
[53:24.47]Okay.
[53:38.53]What?
[53:44.37]Okay.
[53:48.89]This is going to be good.
[53:49.75]This is going to be real.
[53:50.55]It's going to be good.
[53:57.19]Oh, fire it up.
[53:57.81]I didn't fire it up.
[54:06.66]More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more.
[54:15.48]I don't want it to be too hot.
[54:20.87]Do the stream in Italian.
[54:23.27]I don't... I can't speak Italian.
[54:30.11]Why do you think I can speak Italian?
[54:31.19]I can't... I don't know any Italian.
[54:37.59]Oh, my God.
[54:38.15]I can't wait.
[54:38.67]Oh, it's going to be so scrumptious.
[54:41.51]You can't speak Italian.
[54:42.65]Why not?
[54:43.19]Because I don't know.
[54:44.18]I didn't learn Italian.
[54:46.84]I've always wanted to go to Italy.
[54:53.14]Okay, it's not... Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
[55:00.03]It's gonna burn.
[55:01.49]Get it!
[55:06.17]Ah, looks pretty awful.
[55:15.51]Bravo.
[55:15.95]Let's see what the customer has to say.
[55:17.17]What do you think?
[55:17.83]Here you go.
[55:28.80]Eat up.
[55:31.26]I did it in seven minutes.
[55:37.98]Ooh, I can unlock prosciutto?
[55:43.06]Mushrooms.
[55:44.13]Mushrooms.
[55:46.12]Chicken breast.
[55:48.05]And sausage.
[55:51.19]Allows you to replace a quest with a new random one up to three times.
[55:56.89]Uh.
[55:58.99]Yeah.
[56:02.89]Bravo.
[56:05.45]Can I not choose new perk?
[56:11.07]Let's see what your customers... Alright, how do I get out of here?
[56:21.83]What the hell is going on?
[56:23.13]Alright, as previously mentioned, you will choose a perk every third level.
[56:26.59]Okay.
[56:28.73]Unlock perks can be activated and deactivated at the perk app.
[56:32.39]Okay.
[56:37.75]Take a look at the wall next to the serving window.
[56:39.39]This is a certificate proving that I granted you the rank of a novice pizzaglio.
[56:43.90]Magnificent, isn't it?
[56:45.30]I made it myself.
[56:48.90]Oh, okay.
[56:49.46]Thanks.
[56:49.84]Thank you.
[56:52.40]Okay, new things in the quest app.
[56:57.92]Now, instead of just one quest, you'll have three active quests, each one of them belonging to a different specialization.
[57:05.45]Um, okay.
[57:11.29]You got a participation award?
[57:13.67]It's kind of... Whatever.
[57:16.07]The speed specialization focuses on, you guessed it, performing various tasks very... Why is there a talent tree in this game?
[57:23.22]We're making pizzas.
[57:29.47]There's, like, skill points?
[57:33.19]Alright, there's speed, there's quantity, there's quality.
[57:38.43]Okay.
[57:39.93]There's quality.
[57:41.15]You can unlock different skill points.
[57:45.43]Complete all three master tier challenges to become a Pizzaiolo Supreme.
[57:50.58]I never did it myself.
[57:53.66]Alright, we finally made it out of the tutorial.
[57:58.02]Let's go.
[58:00.38]What do you got?
[58:01.01]Any orders?
[58:02.39]No orders.
[58:05.51]How do I get an order?
[58:15.74]Waiting.
[58:18.54]Didn't he say this place was busy?
[58:25.19]I ordered two hours ago.
[58:30.77]Oh, wait.
[58:33.85]I want a marinara pizza.
[58:37.27]I want a marinara pizza.
[58:39.12]Medium dough.
[58:40.28]Marinara.
[58:41.02]Garlic and basil.
[58:41.96]You got it.
[58:42.36]Garlic and basil.
[58:45.60]Medium.
[58:47.92]This is going to be quick as hell.
[58:52.80]Okay.
[58:53.60]Marinara.
[58:57.78]Why is it green?
[59:08.33]Okay, marinara.
[59:17.44]And... Oh, give me that.
[59:22.06]Garlic.
[59:23.22]Do I have any garlic?
[59:25.20]Oh, should I have sweet corn?
[59:28.76]No, I don't have any garlic.
[59:30.44]Oh, no.
[59:31.15]I didn't prepare.
[59:31.81]I didn't prepare.
[59:32.47]I didn't prepare.
[59:34.55]Where's the garlic?
[59:36.17]I need garlic.
[59:39.49]Oh, shit.
[59:39.97]Hurry up.
[59:40.35]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[59:45.82]Garlic.
[59:46.20]Give me one.
[59:47.90]Give me.
[59:48.50]Okay.
[59:48.78]How much does he want?
[59:52.66]Do you want... How much garlic do you want on this pizza?
[59:55.03]Oh.
[59:56.27]I gotta cut it up, too.
[59:57.45]Shit.
[59:57.97]Oh, no.
[59:58.35]I need a basket.
[60:03.05]This dude wants, like, ten cloves of garlic on his pizza.
[60:05.91]Give me the basket.
[60:20.56]Alright, I got... I got a lot... I got enough.
[60:24.21]Ow.
[60:24.27]Alright.
[60:25.74]Chop it up.
[60:26.92]Put it into the cutting machine.
[60:30.40]Way too much.
[60:31.00]No, no.
[60:31.14]I'm going to put it in a GN tray.
[60:33.81]I got this.
[60:34.23]I got it.
[60:34.45]I got it.
[60:34.67]I got it.
[60:34.91]I got it.
[60:35.13]It was a GN tray.
[60:36.49]I need it.
[60:41.98]Oh.
[60:55.80]Okay, let's go, go, go.
[60:56.62]Where's the basil leaf?
[60:58.56]Basil leaf.
[60:59.33]30 grams.
[60:59.63]Give me one.
[61:04.69]Here we go.
[61:10.49]One.
[61:11.85]Alright.
[61:14.62]Garlic.
[61:16.22]He wants 24 grams of cut garlic.
[61:18.56]Okay.
[61:25.15]The 32.
[61:25.39]Alright, alright.
[61:25.83]We're good, we're good.
[61:26.43]And then he wants basil leaf?
[61:28.41]Do I have to cut the basil leaf?
[61:29.59]How do I put this on here?
[61:44.06]What?
[61:44.22]I have to cut it?
[61:53.63]How do I cut the basil?
[62:00.66]Don't cut it.
[62:01.18]Well, I can't put... Let me put it on the pizza.
[62:04.75]Basil leaf.
[62:05.47]Hold on.
[62:06.81]Okay.
[62:07.51]Basil leaf.
[62:09.91]With a knife.
[62:10.81]I don't think I can do that.
[62:12.41]With a knife.
[62:13.51]That wasn't in the tutorial.
[62:14.90]Grandpa didn't tell me how to do that.
[62:18.00]Where do I get a knife?
[62:32.77]That's on there.
[62:33.42]Alright, does he want cheese on this?
[62:42.40]No, he didn't even want cheese.
[62:46.79]Get it.
[62:47.07]Okay, go, go, go, go, go.
[63:00.33]Give me this fucking thing.
[63:01.81]Alright.
[63:02.07]We're herb selection.
[63:03.85]Oh, Jesus.
[63:12.68]Get it in.
[63:23.21]Alright.
[63:23.51]I can take another order.
[63:28.20]How are we doing on heat?
[63:29.12]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[63:30.52]Just leave everything in there until I'm ready to heat everything up.
[63:36.05]Where's the garlic?
[63:36.71]I covered it.
[63:37.37]I smothered it in garlic.
[63:41.71]There's so much garlic on that pizza.
[63:43.21]You'll throw up if you eat it.
[63:44.47]Alright, what do we got?
[63:46.41]That one's going in there.
[63:47.63]That one's good.
[63:48.92]Next up, we got a salami pizza.
[63:52.16]Small salami.
[63:54.06]Alright, get away from me.
[63:55.94]A small salami pizza with just mozzarella, salami, and basil.
[63:59.48]I got it.
[64:06.75]Small.
[64:07.23]I want a small.
[64:11.91]How do I get- How do I make this a small?
[64:24.53]I'm losing heat.
[64:25.11]Hold on.
[64:26.31]The pizza's not burning.
[64:27.15]It's fine.
[64:27.51]I thought they had bugs on it.
[64:42.79]Alright, here you go.
[64:51.07]That's not what I wanted to do.
[64:53.21]Oh, Jesus.
[64:54.55]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[64:55.35]I gotta put it on a plate.
[64:56.96]Just pick it up with my hands.
[64:57.98]I don't even care.
[65:06.00]You fucking stupid ass.
[65:08.48]Oh, my God, dude.
[65:10.57]Stop, stop, stop.
[65:18.97]There's no counter space!
[65:26.15]Oh, what the fuck, man?
[65:27.57]Come on!
[65:33.46]Alright, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[65:36.62]Here, serve it.
[65:40.32]Ding.
[65:41.20]That is the marinara pizza.
[65:42.50]How'd you like it?
[65:43.66]Alright, I gotta get to work on this.
[65:44.97]I need a small.
[65:47.88]I unlocked Alfredo sauce?
[65:49.54]Oh, shit.
[65:52.82]Oh, gotta get the bacon.
[65:53.62]Buffalo mozzarella.
[65:54.34]Alright, close this.
[66:06.31]Medium dough.
[66:08.17]I can't split it to a small.
[66:14.85]Oh, there's a small right there.
[66:17.86]Okay, let's go.
[66:25.51]Okay.
[66:26.59]And you wanted what?
[66:27.29]Let's pin it.
[66:31.77]You wanted a little bit of mozzarella cheese?
[66:36.25]I... Yes.
[66:38.48]Mozzarella cheese?
[66:39.22]Only 16 grams.
[66:40.58]That seems like not very much.
[66:43.78]Very much.
[66:47.06]Oh, shit.
[66:48.60]Oops.
[66:48.95]Okay, hold on.
[66:49.69]How much marinara?
[66:50.81]Marinara.
[66:55.99]It'll be a surprise.
[66:59.29]Okay, there's your marinara.
[67:00.17]There's your mozzarella cheese.
[67:01.13]You need some salami.
[67:03.96]I know the salami in here somewhere.
[67:05.34]There it is.
[67:06.84]Cut salami.
[67:09.58]I'm going to do this cool, though.
[67:16.49]No, I need to be able to put more than that.
[67:18.17]And then basil leaf.
[67:23.21]Okay, basil.
[67:31.30]How much basil?
[67:37.40]There's more basil than salami on this pizza.
[67:43.39]Oh, we want a grated mozzarella cheese.
[67:45.31]Uh-oh.
[67:45.99]Alright, can I take it off?
[67:53.68]He won't even notice.
[67:54.34]A thousand kilograms of mozzarella.
[68:18.11]That sounds like a really cool band name.
[68:34.89]You don't think that of what?
[68:35.87]A thousand kilograms of mozzarella is not a cool name for like a band?
[68:40.43]Why not?
[68:42.44]How do I clean this?
[68:49.43]How is it a band name?
[68:50.37]I don't know.
[68:53.64]Name a band.
[68:55.14]Let's find out how weird the names are.
[69:05.31]Fallout Boy?
[69:07.19]The Beatles.
[69:13.49]Oh, this is burning.
[69:14.19]Get it out.
[69:14.49]Get it out.
[69:14.75]Get it out.
[69:22.46]Okay, put it on a small plate.
[69:26.30]Tupperware Remix Party.
[69:29.68]If that's a real name for a band, then how is mine any stranger?
[69:45.18]Jimmy Eat World.
[69:46.40]Okay, here we go.
[69:50.46]Take it.
[69:52.16]What do you think?
[69:52.58]This next one.
[69:56.14]Oh, what's wrong?
[69:57.38]Oh, the cheese is wrong.
[69:58.14]Right.
[69:58.30]Whatever.
[69:58.54]Another marinara pizza.
[70:02.69]This one is medium.
[70:14.24]Roll it out.
[70:20.47]So what did you want?
[70:21.15]This one's going to be perfect.
[70:27.50]You want... Let's pin this.
[70:32.20]Marinara.
[70:34.14]Let's get the Marinara.
[70:35.32]I'm going to do this as best as I can.
[70:36.56]I'm really going to try as hard as I can.
[70:59.43]Okay.
[71:00.99]That's not bad.
[71:01.83]That could have been way worse.
[71:06.70]More sauce?
[71:08.54]Extra sauce?
[71:22.20]That looks good.
[71:23.92]Okay, garlic.
[71:25.64]Got garlic.
[71:28.72]Get out of the way.
[71:29.20]You're in my way.
[71:29.94]Please get out of the way.
[71:31.14]Out.
[71:31.26]Alright, I'm gonna do this the way that I would want it.
[71:37.08]I like it in little clusters.
[71:38.17]I can't do that though.
[71:42.43]Why?
[71:48.17]I have no more garlic left.
[71:49.19]Shit.
[71:50.15]Shit.
[71:53.37]Uh... Give me this goddamn basket.
[72:01.26]We're gonna fill this thing to the brim with garlic.
[72:14.34]Great... Great your... I'm not gonna say that out loud.
[72:17.78]That's insane what you just said.
[72:26.86]I love garlic though.
[72:27.64]I'm totally cool with this.
[72:31.36]Okay.
[72:32.80]Uh, I need one of those things.
[72:42.55]There we go.
[72:43.25]That's much better.
[72:43.83]Alright.
[72:51.07]Garlic.
[72:52.49]That's it.
[72:52.79]No cheese or anything, huh?
[72:54.51]Okay.
[72:55.45]That's fine.
[72:59.61]Not much more, right?
[73:02.67]32.
[73:02.75]Okay.
[73:03.83]And then a little bit of basil.
[73:04.63]24.
[73:07.49]What are you doing?
[73:19.40]What are you doing?
[73:27.32]Can I put one more?
[73:28.12]So I'm going to put one more.
[73:29.28]I don't care.
[73:29.54]It looks better.
[73:29.94]Alright, get it in there.
[73:38.35]You think the person's really going to complain?
[73:39.65]They're going to get their pizza and go, excuse me.
[73:42.69]There was an extra basil leaf on here that I did not order.
[73:46.68]Guys, if you order a bunch of shit on a pizza, they could probably hide bugs in it and you wouldn't even know it was on there.
[74:03.19]You're not gonna notice one basil leaf.
[74:14.96]Okay, let's... This is gonna cook fast.
[74:20.18]I hope you never prepare food for anyone.
[74:24.46]I mean, very... Come on.
[74:25.62]Very clearly, playing... Cooking Simulator Pizza Sim... I...
[74:34.96]What just happened?
[74:36.60]I pressed... I pressed Q. Oh, dear.
[75:00.32]Oh, well.
[75:11.93]burnt to fuck.
[75:14.73]Yeah, because I pressed Q. Why is there an instantly burn the pizza button?
[75:21.13]What's that for?
[75:21.97]It was a zero, apparently.
[75:37.66]It was a zero.
[75:39.48]Alright.
[75:40.74]Do not mess this one up.
[75:43.72]Just do it.
[75:44.41]Just pin it.
[75:45.29]Let's go.
[75:46.59]You want a medium-sized dough.
[75:59.54]Shut the operation down.
[76:01.28]Okay, Baron Arrow.
[76:13.66]We're closing for today?
[76:15.85]What?
[76:16.35]Oh, shit.
[76:16.73]Hold on.
[76:21.25]I forgot that we're at a restaurant.
[76:22.85]Okay.
[76:23.21]Let's... Mozzarella.
[76:24.17]Cut.
[76:24.37]100.
[76:26.73]Not bad.
[76:30.86]Okay.
[76:31.14]What's next?
[76:32.80]Basil.
[76:33.98]Done.
[76:39.66]How much do you want?
[76:40.14]24. 24.
[76:46.03]Alright, get it in there and don't screw this up.
[76:56.20]The freezer's been open the whole time in the basement.
[76:59.33]Did I open it?
[76:59.83]Did I do that?
[77:07.87]I did?
[77:22.64]Not good.
[77:26.44]It's done.
[77:26.84]It'll be done in a minute.
[77:29.84]It's not gonna burn.
[77:30.84]Just don't press the incinerate button.
[77:46.16]I just pin it.
[77:49.07]I just felt a sneeze coming on.
[77:51.79]And I panicked and pressed every button on my stream deck.
[78:01.86]It's not burnt.
[78:02.44]It's fine.
[78:14.14]I muted the game?
[78:14.90]Yeah.
[78:15.40]Oh, shit.
[78:15.80]It's still muted.
[78:16.41]Sorry.
[78:17.61]Yeah, I felt the sneeze coming on, so I was like, I don't want to sneeze on camera.
[78:20.89]So I just went, and I mashed my fingers all over my stream deck to try to turn everything off.
[78:31.13]How's this burn?
[78:31.67]It looks perfect.
[78:39.09]I was going to just whip it over here, but I can't do that.
[78:42.29]Alright.
[78:43.93]First day of my new pizza job completed.
[78:48.49]Now prepare the ingredients for tomorrow.
[78:50.13]Ooh!
[78:52.02]This part's fun.
[78:52.58]Okay, here we go.
[78:55.62]Where's the clean?
[78:56.46]How do I clean up?
[79:03.36]There's no trash.
[79:10.48]You only made two pizzas in a whole day?
[79:12.20]Yeah, but it's quality, so...
[79:17.73]Alright, let's make some dough.
[79:19.95]We need flour.
[79:22.89]Let me clean up first.
[79:23.83]This is hell.
[79:40.18]Make glass pizza.
[79:44.44]Alright, hold on.
[79:45.02]I'm not going to serve glass pizza to somebody yet.
[79:50.03]And I say yet because you know I probably eventually will.
[80:02.11]Psycho.
[80:03.43]You all know I'm going to make a glass pizza.
[80:06.29]That's like a rocket scientist that's at the stream for more than 10 minutes.
[80:10.58]Somebody's going to eat glass today.
[80:13.61]Alright, flour.
[80:20.69]Open.
[80:26.44]Alright, what is it?
[80:26.84]I need the recipe.
[80:30.12]Where is it?
[80:30.46]Okay, I want dough.
[80:38.87]So let's pin this.
[80:40.61]Okay.
[80:40.73]Okay.
[80:43.26]Alright, it's 3.5 kilograms of fiber.
[80:49.38]What if I just make a shitload of it?
[80:51.74]I'm going to do a double batch.
[80:54.74]So let's do double.
[80:56.16]Just double the whole thing up.
[81:02.70]Okay, so 3.5, 3.5, so that's 7.
[81:07.07]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[81:08.29]Alright, well, I'm going to use tap water.
[81:15.22]Can't pick this up.
[81:19.16]Oh, okay.
[81:19.88]I need a container.
[81:24.69]Fire extinguisher into the dough.
[81:26.61]No, not yet.
[81:30.69]Put some soap in there.
[81:34.25]Oh, here we go.
[81:34.71]A jug.
[81:47.24]Get down there.
[81:48.56]Don't break it.
[81:50.47]Do not break it.
[81:51.25]Okay.
[82:15.55]Alright.
[82:16.25]Pour it in.
[82:24.86]2.4.
[82:24.88]Nice.
[82:35.25]That just turned into a blooming onion from Outback.
[82:39.07]Whatever.
[82:39.37]Alright, I need salt.
[82:44.25]125 grams.
[82:57.60]Wait, wait, wait.
[82:58.28]Easy, easy, easy.
[82:59.20]Not that much salt.
[83:03.55]We want a blooming onion.
[83:05.49]You really don't, though, because it sucks.
[83:08.19]You order it, you eat three or four little cloves, and then nobody else at the table wants to eat it.
[83:16.34]You eat it with that delicious blooming sauce.
[83:19.80]You eat five of them, and for some reason, you're one of the only people at the table that's eating it.
[83:25.25]Because you go to the Outback and you get the meme order.
[83:28.19]And everyone's like, I don't fucking want to eat that.
[83:29.69]And then like, oh, but let's get it.
[83:30.93]Okay, now I need yeast.
[83:41.48]And then you have that awkward moment where like the waiter or the waitress comes over.
[83:45.80]And two-thirds of the Bloomin' Onion is still there.
[83:49.62]After you've eaten your entrees.
[83:52.98]You guys are still picking at that?
[83:57.63]no but I'm gonna take this thing home I'm taking this thing home and I'm gonna eat it in the microwave later I don't hit the red button the green one okay that's dough I need how much sauce do I have left I think I have enough sauce
[84:30.91]Clean this place up.
[84:31.77]Close the windows.
[84:32.67]I don't want anybody looking in here.
[84:34.25]Okay, I have... I need some more dough.
[84:41.38]I need to really... I gotta clean up.
[84:43.14]Let's make this place not look like shit.
[84:50.02]I'm just on the floor.
[84:54.12]Oops.
[85:00.75]I need to pick this up.
[85:02.71]I have to pick this up.

[85:19.40]Go back to normal.
[85:21.40]Go back to normal.
[85:24.68]Back to normal.
[85:27.94]Why can I not pick this up?
[85:34.84]Alright, no more advanced controls.
[85:36.35]Just give it to me.
[85:39.93]Okay.
[85:42.37]I'm trying to pick the dough up like this.
[85:55.58]You know what?
[85:55.90]Just... I'll pick it up with my feet if I have to.
[86:10.42]okay right now I'm doing the thing that okay let's say let's say you're like a blanket falls on the ground or like a pillows on the ground that you want but you don't want to bend over so you just reach over with your foot and you scrunch your toes around the blanket and you pull it up I'm not actually doing that with this I'm just saying that's like what it reminds me of I got plenty of dough now plenty of dough various shapes and sizes
[86:41.93]Okay.
[86:43.11]Lots of dough.
[86:43.69]Let's put this back where it belongs.
[86:48.05]Okay.
[86:48.37]I already have one.
[86:57.78]I have two now.
[87:03.24]It's covered in dust.
[87:05.12]How do I clean?
[87:08.34]That's what I want to know.
[87:13.13]I think I have enough marinara sauce for tomorrow.
[87:22.60]I need a little container.
[87:24.26]Here, can I put glass in here?
[87:28.96]I can't.

[118:02.26]Alright.
[118:03.91]Alfredo sauce.
[118:05.01]Mozzarella.
[118:06.41]Chicken breast.
[118:07.09]I don't even have chicken breast.

[118:43.19]Like little shredded cheese chicken pieces?
[118:45.33]Actually, that's... That isn't disgusting.
[118:47.57]That's fine.
[118:51.79]There we go.
[118:54.89]Okay.
[118:57.07]Now...
[118:59.84]SpongeBob?
[119:01.70]Why do I hear SpongeBob's music?
[119:06.28]Stop crashing when I click this info link!
[119:14.52]Stop!
[119:14.98]Why?
[119:16.66]Stop clicking it while I need to see.
[119:17.92]I gotta pin it.
[119:23.95]You're making the subway trays.
[119:27.95]Just turn this place into a subway.
[119:29.29]Don't even do pizzas anymore.
[119:30.27]Just do subway sandwiches.
[119:33.30]Just line like four or five pieces of cold, gross chicken strips.
[119:38.80]Squeeze way too much mayonnaise and way too much mustard all over it.
[119:43.82]And then grab the container of wilted lettuce.
[119:51.53]And then be out of all the cool breads.
[119:57.09]Uh, can I have it on the, uh, herb bake, uh, herb bake, uh, focaccia bread?
[120:00.71]We don't have that.
[120:01.73]Can I have it on, uh, wheat and oregano?
[120:04.05]We don't have that today.
[120:05.53]Alright, can I have it on just default fucking, like, sub bread?
[120:08.45]Sure.
[120:09.95]There's only cringe breads left.
[120:15.62]Yeah.
[120:22.97]The last time I went to Subway, I had the... It was one... I don't know.
[120:27.25]It was the last experience I'll ever have there.
[120:28.63]And I'm sorry this is going to come off as I'm going to sound like elitist or something.
[120:32.53]I really don't mean to be.
[120:34.15]But when they take that... When they take that like carnival fare container of chicken and cheese that they melt in the microwave thing and they dump it upside down onto the bread.
[120:47.06]It's like in the french fry container from the carnival.
[120:49.20]You know what I'm talking about?
[120:53.54]It's this little paper container and then they turn it upside down like three times.
[120:57.52]And it's just this melted cheese and chicken mess.
[121:05.18]And it was still like somehow cold in the middle still.
[121:07.38]I don't know how.
[121:11.00]You never went to the carnival?
[121:11.98]Oh, really?
[121:15.12]I love the carnival.
[121:15.78]You know, you've never been to the carnival before?
[121:17.40]This is a medium, right?
[121:20.74]No, it's a large.
[121:21.80]This dude, this is a large pizza.
[121:24.67]This is a big one.
[121:25.27]Is it Meat Lover's Pizza?
[121:31.44]Okay, you want Alfredo sauce.
[121:34.22]Which... What happened to my... Oh.
[121:40.97]Okay, Alfredo sauce.
[121:51.27]I don't know why, but this reminds me of egg yolk.
[121:53.29]And it's making me want to just not make this anymore.
[121:56.70]Okay.
[122:04.86]That's Alfredo sauce.
[122:07.34]Mozzarella.
[122:07.86]Cut mozzarella.
[122:08.61]I think this would be too much.
[122:11.75]Okay.
[122:19.27]Chicken breast.
[122:25.80]96 grams?
[122:33.09]Hey, let's get somebody that's at this dinner party the best bite.
[122:41.55]You know what I mean?
[122:46.14]This guy gets the good... Whoever gets that gets the good slice.
[122:48.50]And then basil leaf.
[122:59.64]And that's it.
[123:01.86]Alright.
[123:08.02]Wrong sauce?
[123:08.79]What are you talking about?
[123:13.83]What about... I forgot onion?
[123:15.89]We're closing for the day.
[123:16.95]Oh, shit.
[123:21.71]I'm never gonna get that ever again.
[123:22.71]I don't know why I did that.
[123:24.47]Oh, good thing there's a backup.
[123:26.74]I forgot onions.
[123:28.84]Oh, white onions.
[123:31.76]White onion cut.
[123:32.56]64.
[123:34.70]Okay.
[123:35.10]Alright.
[123:47.85]The next piece I make, I'm going to make just one slice.
[123:50.39]I'm going to have one slice have all the toppings on it and everything else is going to be bare.
[123:57.26]I'm talking sauce too, by the way.
[124:07.96]Let's get through this day and clean up, though.
[124:12.27]Sauce 2 waiting room.
[124:16.75]Sauce 2.
[124:19.47]Why am I doing that?
[124:20.83]I can't get them back.
[124:22.01]I can't take this pizza out.
[124:30.17]Oh, thank God.
[124:31.57]It sucked to me.
[124:32.47]Okay.

[125:36.57]It's not burning, it's fine.
[125:38.57]Look at that cheese bubbling up.
[125:43.30]Why is it frozen?
[125:45.46]Every time I take a piece out of the oven, it fucking freezes.
[125:48.12]What are you doing?
[125:56.52]Stop freezing.
[125:57.46]Stop freezing.
[126:00.46]Why is it frozen?
[126:02.44]Oh my God.
[126:03.24]Okay.

[176:31.70]And then cheese.
[176:32.30]500 grams apart is just one cube.
[176:34.34]Cocaine is bad for you.
[176:37.44]Yes, it is.
[176:38.12]I've never done it before.
[176:39.32]And I would say never do it.
[176:40.96]Ever.
[176:41.56]It's bad for you.
[176:41.99]Don't do it.
[176:43.09]I agree.
[176:43.69]I completely agree with you.
[176:48.67]What you are witnessing is caffeine and neuroticism.
[176:51.39]So, it's a little different.
[176:55.95]Okay.
[176:56.89]I have those containers, right?
[177:08.61]That's perfect, yeah.
[177:09.71]There it is.
[177:11.73]Not eroticism.
[177:12.87]Alright, this Alfredo is junk.

[177:44.41]Okay, there's my... This looks kind of old, doesn't it?
[177:49.11]When marinara sauce looks like meat sauce, that's when it's probably time to get rid of it, isn't it?
[177:59.34]Ah, fuck it.
[177:59.74]Whatever.
[177:59.96]It's still good.

[178:09.49]Oh, there's chicken in here.
[178:11.09]Why is there so much chicken?
[178:12.23]Why are there so many uncooked potato chips in here?
[178:18.71]Garlic.
[178:30.68]I don't like Alfredo sauce.
[178:32.08]I like it sometimes.
[178:32.80]Depends on what it is.
[178:41.48]Why is there still chicken in here?
[178:43.76]Wait, what is going on?
[178:51.18]This... What the fuck?
[179:01.01]How much chicken did I put in here?
[179:04.31]Why is it that much chicken?
[179:09.34]Was it that much?
[179:17.04]Alright, let's go.

[179:31.41]Alright, now I need... I might need a little bit more mozzarella, but... Okay, I need pesto.
[179:44.72]Pesto is a bunch of olive oil.
[179:47.23]Which I have.

[179:55.14]Oh, that's unfortunate.

[180:25.87]That's horseshit.
[180:29.25]Oh, it hurts.
[180:31.45]It hurts to look at.
[180:33.31]I now need basil.

[214:35.08]Can I just mix them together?
[214:37.06]Alright, where's that cheese?
[214:48.35]I threw it up here.
[215:00.29]It looks like good bacon.
[215:04.95]The floor.
[215:10.29]I don't see it anywhere.
[215:17.14]Oh, there it is.
[215:21.90]They wanted it chopped up, right?
[215:24.40]Chopped cheddar cheese.
[215:34.25]Make a little Caesar's pizza.
[215:35.25]Just get some cardboard.
[215:40.51]I love this kind of cheese.
[215:41.85]I love when it's sliced.
[215:42.79]I love the, I love the just cheddar slices.
[215:45.38]That's my favorite.
[215:47.18]Alright, let's make this.
[215:49.16]So this one is 120 of cheddar, 96 of bacon.
[216:08.50]We put like craft singles on here.
[216:10.46]This is kind of weird, right?
[216:13.00]Okay.
[216:18.09]Uh, bacon.
[216:18.49]96.
[216:20.11]This is just a Plinko machine.
[216:38.58]96?
[216:38.70]This is a very ugly pizza.
[216:45.95]Okay.
[216:46.75]And then basil, right?
[216:50.03]Basil leaf.
[216:51.85]36.
[216:51.89]And that's it.
[216:52.33]And then we just cook them.
[217:04.34]Or it's a match 3 iPad game.
[217:13.18]36.
[217:13.20]Alright, let's get it in there.
[217:16.84]Nice and hot.
[217:18.87]Burning hot oven.
[217:27.45]Ban the customer who ordered that.
[217:37.67]Okay, cool.
[217:38.17]Let's load it up.
[217:42.26]I'm a shirtless?
[217:42.94]Yeah, there's like two or three pictures of me with no clothes on on the internet.
[217:48.20]Okay, I'm making that sound like it's way more in than what, you know what I mean?
[217:52.32]Like, oh yeah, of course there's pictures of me naked on the internet.
[217:54.74]They're there.
[217:56.54]No, I mean like, there's like a few stills of me without clothes.
[218:04.05]Your nude's leaked.
[218:10.66]Make a peanut butter and fluff pizza.
[218:16.99]That sounds kind of good, actually.
[218:29.27]Okay.
[218:31.76]In three, two, one.
[218:33.66]They're done.
[218:36.28]Get him out.
[218:36.68]Get him out.
[218:36.98]Get him out.
[218:37.28]Get him out.
[218:37.52]Get him out.
[218:37.84]Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out.
[218:39.72]Don't.
[218:45.08]Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
[218:46.72]Ah, this doesn't even look like it's cooked.
[219:05.81]There is nothing to cook.
[219:08.76]Yeah, I don't... I know that getting a pizza without cheese, a lot of people do.
[219:13.32]You know, you just get the sauce and the... It's a little burnt, but whatever.
[219:17.46]I don't... I'm not into that.
[219:29.37]And almost done.
[219:32.39]At link, please.
[219:33.29]Hold on.
[219:45.45]What, you made me like five times smaller?
[219:47.13]Is that the thing?
[219:47.89]I don't get it.
[219:48.33]Is that the joke?
[219:50.72]I'm just like, I'm 50% smaller than I was.
[219:53.14]What?
[219:56.26]I don't get it.
[220:13.33]I look like, I look like dopey.
[220:17.07]Did you mess with this image?
[220:18.45]You did.
[220:21.62]You did.
[220:22.04]You have alien eyes.
[220:47.47]What?
[220:48.25]What?
[220:56.38]Don't knock that over.
[220:57.18]Alright, these are ready to be served.
[221:03.02]Alright, we need two medium pans.
[221:09.53]I like to call it making it great.
[221:12.26]What's making it great mean?
[221:13.62]Well, we here at Pizza Hut, making it great means we get it ready for the customer, correct every time.
[221:19.45]Don't forget the fairy dust.
[221:20.91]What's fairy dust?
[221:22.55]Well, it's another way for us to making it great here at Pizza Hut.
[221:26.37]You sprinkle the fairy dust on the pizza right at the very end.
[221:29.81]Sprinkle it right at the very end?
[221:31.33]Yeah, it's a secret recipe.
[221:32.69]It's actually just Parmesan cheese and we just pretended something else.
[221:35.90]Oh, cool.
[221:38.14]What pizza?
[221:38.42]Which one was this one?
[221:39.04]Meat?
[221:44.95]What?
[221:45.69]Oh, you waited a long time.
[221:47.21]Sorry, you waited for perfection.
[221:48.79]You know how many times they delayed Smash Bros.
[221:53.23]Brawl?
[221:54.53]And that game was considered probably one of the worst ones.
[222:05.46]This is the Neapolitan pizza.
[222:10.78]Boy, I need a
[222:15.22]It is the worst one.
[222:19.14]I enjoyed it though.
[222:20.12]It was alright.
[222:21.20]It was still fun to play.
[222:30.72]Subspace Emissary blows World of Light out of the water.
[222:34.00]World of Light was cool, but it was... It was like too much.
[222:38.70]This is the cheese one, right?
[222:39.82]Nope.
[222:47.20]They made such a job.
[222:48.34]Oh, wait a minute.
[222:49.86]Chili peppers.
[222:51.86]Pepperoni.
[222:52.36]I'm going to make my favorite pizza.
[222:53.94]Finally.
[222:54.40]Finally.
[222:54.72]Took like fucking four hours.
[222:55.74]Provolone on pizza.
[223:12.17]I mean, I guess you could say that Smash Brothers...
[223:16.42]is more about playing the game Smash Brothers, like, fighting game style than doing a single-player campaign, and they just added a ton of shit to do.
[223:24.48]So it's just kind of extra stuff, I guess.
[223:35.63]But even Smash Ultimate, what are there, a hundred fucking characters in that game?
[223:44.63]I didn't even unlock them all.
[223:50.46]Fungi.
[223:52.94]Fungi.
[223:55.06]Hmm.
[224:01.88]Hmm.
[224:07.83]Hmm.
[224:10.59]I don't have mushrooms.
[224:11.95]Time to get mushrooms.
[224:16.89]How many mushrooms?
[224:18.19]Let's chop them up.
[224:18.83]Give me a basket.
[224:30.00]Make a Bunger?
[224:33.27]I'm going to make my favorite pizza.
[224:40.89]We'll make my pizza and their pizza at the same time.
[224:52.13]Let me make sure that I have everything.
[224:56.25]I do.
[225:00.23]It's going to be so delicious.
[225:01.45]You have no idea.
[225:02.10]You're going to get fired?
[225:06.40]Okay.
[225:07.20]You can't fire me, dad.
[225:08.78]My dad owns this place.
[225:09.70]I'm not going to get fired.
[225:13.96]He's going to walk in here and he's going to put his hand on his head.
[225:15.62]He's going to go.
[225:19.91]Then he's going to clean all this up.
[225:22.42]And then I'm going to come to work tomorrow.
[225:23.36]Alright, what's a what's like a good thin crust?
[225:38.95]Would Neapolitan or would New York be better for thin crust?
[225:47.59]New York OK.
[225:49.45]So I'm going to go with a large pizza because I like or I order a large pizza.
[225:56.44]Anytime I get a pizza, it's always a big, long, large, thin pizza.
[226:04.14]And how we start off my favorite pizza is we start off with just with just this is marinara, just marinara sauce.
[226:11.57]I like my marinara sauce to be very much under the cheese, by the way.
[226:16.16]I like the cheese to be really sort of on top of the marinara sauce.
[226:42.66]That's just normal.
[226:44.52]Alright, yes, yes, yes.
[226:45.94]I'm just doing my favorite pizza, okay?
[226:48.20]That's just how pizza's made.
[226:50.18]But... This is my favorite pizza, okay?
[226:58.94]The eye is looking at me.
[227:01.21]The eye is looking at me.
[227:02.27]Did you see that?
[227:02.81]That eye was staring at me.
[227:04.59]I don't like this.
[227:05.51]I'm thrown away.
[227:10.54]Okay, I'm gonna do it again.
[227:26.95]Okay.
[227:28.57]A good layer of sauce.
[227:32.01]I like the sauce to be tangy, too.
[227:35.52]Some people don't like a tangy pizza sauce.
[227:37.30]I do.
[227:38.46]I think it compliments the pepperoni.
[227:41.00]Oh, I just told you what my pizza was.
[227:42.53]Okay, so that looks good.
[227:49.15]I don't actually like the thick mozzarella cut.
[227:53.05]I like the shredded mozzarella.
[227:56.39]I like it to be shredded all over it.
[227:58.98]And none of this bullshit where you can see.
[228:00.98]No, no, I want it all over it.
[228:04.62]I ran out.
[228:07.59]I need more.
[228:07.95]Get in the cheese grater.
[228:23.20]Alright, go.
[228:35.46]Cat hair pizza.
[228:39.87]It looks like that when it's before it goes into the oven, alright?
[228:43.55]Relax.
[228:51.74]Nice and cheesy.
[228:52.78]Really get a good layer.
[228:55.34]Is it floating?
[228:55.98]Uh... Why is it floating?
[229:10.71]Okay, that looks alright.
[229:12.03]I just want a nice good layer.
[229:14.96]Then comes the pepperoni, which I don't even have up here.
[229:23.56]Pepperoni.
[229:26.36]And I like the small pepperonis, the little ones.
[229:31.04]Not the mini-mini ones, but just not the huge ones.
[229:34.40]I don't hate the huge ones, but I would rather have the smaller ones.
[229:47.69]This guy's wicked horny.
[229:50.95]Shut up.
[229:51.55]No, I'm not.
[229:53.53]I'm not.
[229:53.89]I'm actually not.
[229:54.43]Why am I making a joke like I am?
[229:56.03]I'm not.
[229:57.39]Shut up.
[230:00.36]What am I doing that for?
[230:01.12]That's not... Alright.
[230:04.66]Dude, dude.
[230:06.14]I'm making a pizza.
[230:08.12]Then I put the pepperoni on there.
[230:09.54]And then I shred the cheese up.
[230:11.54]And then I like a lot more cheese than normal.
[230:13.12]Maybe a little bit of extra cheese.
[230:14.30]Not too much, though.
[230:15.94]Holy shit, this guy's wicked fucking horny.
[230:19.45]I'm what?
[230:20.13]What happened?
[230:24.31]Okay, let's pepperoni.
[230:27.53]Here it is.
[230:28.59]And I like when the pepperoni is in a spiral out.
[230:38.28]Because then you get a piece of pepperoni on almost every single bite of your pizza.
[230:48.65]I ran out.
[230:50.07]God damn it.
[230:51.13]I'm trying to make my favorite fucking pizza.
[230:54.39]Get back.
[230:55.35]Get... Why are so many things knocked over on the floor?
[231:13.08]I don't know, man, because cooking is hard.
[231:27.03]No, it's not.
[231:27.59]Yes, it is.
[231:28.53]Otherwise, you wouldn't be paying people tons of money at restaurants to make it for you.
[231:47.74]Okay.
[231:51.02]We're not done.
[231:52.84]I also like there to be
[231:56.26]Just a dash.
[231:57.20]Just like a whack of garlic.
[232:01.69]Ladies and gentlemen, this is my favorite pizza.
[232:06.54]Oh, it's not done yet.
[232:07.88]It's not done yet.
[232:09.14]Stop rushing me.
[232:11.34]Stop rushing me.
[232:12.80]It's not done yet.
[232:37.70]Is he drinking it?
[232:40.02]A little just drizzle, drizzle.
[232:41.50]And I can't do it in this game, but you know what I mean?
[232:43.56]You go wing, wing, wing, wing, wing, wing, wing, wing.
[232:48.78]Okay, you know, you ever see Unwrapped on Food Network?
[232:51.18]You know those machines that do that to the chocolates?
[232:53.72]They just go like blim, blim, blim, blim, blim, blim.
[232:56.18]Make like a little line up, down, up, down, up, down.
[232:59.79]Olive oil.
[233:01.34]Get it in there.
[233:02.44]And you make sure that oven is hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
[233:07.07]500 degrees.
[233:07.61]Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot oven.
[233:09.05]Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
[233:10.79]Don't put it in there unless it's fucking smoking hot.
[233:16.17]Hot.
[233:16.55]Very hot.
[233:19.03]Why is he talking to us like kids?
[233:22.49]I just said the F word like four times.
[233:24.67]What?
[233:26.37]Alright, nice and hot.
[233:31.87]There it is.
[233:33.09]Oh, yes.
[233:35.82]Magic.
[233:37.52]Get it in there.
[233:38.24]Burning hot oven.
[233:40.06]Yes.
[233:44.88]I'm sorry.
[233:45.94]Some people are going to freak out about this.
[233:48.52]When that bar fills to green, I ain't taking it out.
[233:52.72]I'm not taking it out.
[233:55.40]I'm going to wait until it's a little bit overdone.
[233:58.98]Just a hair.
[234:00.58]Just enough.
[234:07.36]Custom robo waiting room.
[234:08.56]It's been like eight months, dude.
[234:14.77]Look.
[234:16.79]Yep.
[234:17.77]Already looks good.
[234:20.47]Already looks perfect.
[234:21.35]Alright.
[234:22.35]Don't take it out.
[234:24.92]Leave it in.
[234:27.22]Get it out.
[234:27.62]Get it out.
[234:27.90]Get it.
[234:29.02]Leave it in.
[234:29.30]Dude, take it out.
[234:31.38]Take it out.
[234:31.92]Leave it in.
[234:32.24]Don't touch it.
[234:33.40]Leave it in.
[234:35.12]Okay.
[234:35.42]Alright.
[234:35.68]Alright.
[234:35.94]Alright.
[234:36.22]Leave it in.
[234:36.80]Leave it in.
[234:37.08]Leave it in.
[234:37.36]Leave it in.
[234:37.64]Leave it in.
[234:37.92]Leave it in.
[234:45.04]It's perfect.
[234:47.50]That's the best pizza I've made all night.
[234:51.45]It's perfect.
[235:05.89]And I don't put, no, no basil, no oregano.
[235:10.21]No, no, no, no, no.
[235:11.63]You leave it alone and you eat it just like that.
[235:16.53]And you can tell when it's right.
[235:18.47]When you go with the pizza cutter.
[235:25.29]If you hear that sound, you've done it right.
[235:31.53]And then when you pick it up and pull it out.
[235:34.13]A little bit of the cheese is just running off the sides.
[235:38.38]And you bite into it.
[235:39.06]And you bite it.
[235:40.82]It's a hot bite.
[235:42.54]You get a little bit of that oil from the pepperoni.
[235:44.76]The mozzarella flows in there.
[235:45.94]The garlic is there.
[235:47.18]And you... The best part.
[236:03.50]And then, like, after you bite into it, you go, and then you spit it out.
[236:07.60]You spit, like, the, you bite into it, you let it smear out of your mouth onto the plate because it's too hot, and you didn't wait long enough.
[236:17.49]And then you go, alright, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever.
[236:20.01]Nice.
[236:34.92]At least the pizza got out.
[236:39.08]Whatever.
[236:39.86]At least the pizza got out.
[236:41.92]Alright, I didn't make the other pizza.
[236:45.22]Wait, should I make my second favorite pizza?
[236:48.18]I feel like I should.
[236:48.82]Okay, second favorite pizza.
[236:55.26]Incoming.
[236:57.49]Do I have it?
[236:57.97]Do I have the ingredients for it?
[237:01.47]I don't.
[237:02.23]I need something else.
[237:06.85]Plain cheese pizza.
[237:08.68]That's good a lot of the time.
[237:15.82]I could, you know, I could do one of my favorite pizzas.
[237:19.90]I could do one of my favorites.
[237:30.29]Yeah, sure.
[237:31.41]Okay.
[237:32.05]I already have bacon.
[237:34.61]What am I doing?
[237:36.72]We'll start, we'll go with the medium.
[237:41.44]What about the customer?
[237:43.40]He's just sitting here waiting for his pizza and he hears me talking to somebody on the phone.
[237:48.09]And I'm making the person on my phone my favorite pizzas that they're not going to eat.
[237:51.87]Hey, um, it was like 14 bucks for that pizza.
[238:00.62]Just hold on, I'm telling somebody my favorite pizzas.
[238:04.02]You'll be up soon.
[238:07.22]Okay, so the next one.
[238:09.48]Use the same dough.
[238:10.16]We'll do a medium.
[238:11.60]No, we're going to do a small because... No, I'm going to use the dough I have.
[238:17.04]Medium.
[238:20.11]Coming up next is one of my other favorites.
[238:27.13]And that starts... That starts with, as you probably could have guessed... Aranera.
[238:40.73]Only this time, we're going to do something a little different.
[238:43.63]This time, we're not going to put the cheese on first.
[238:49.86]What we're going to do... Are you ready?
[238:51.86]We're going to put the... I want grated onions, not cut onions.
[238:57.07]Grated onions, not cut onions.
[238:58.65]Excuse me.
[239:18.31]Well, you know, okay, you know what I mean?
[239:20.67]I want them like, okay, no, they're actually already like that, okay.
[239:26.29]Here we go.
[239:28.57]Onions.
[239:33.04]Onions, onions, onions, onions, onions, a lot of onions.
[239:36.50]Onions, onions, onions, onions, onions.
[239:39.86]And then, after that, we do the cheese.
[239:45.16]This is mozzarella.
[239:54.37]And a little bit of bacon.
[239:59.03]No, it's not a toenail pizza.
[240:01.25]Relax.
[240:04.23]Fingernails and toenails.
[240:12.43]Oh, god damn it, man.
[240:20.25]That's just what the game looks like, okay?
[240:24.16]Don't make me turn the music back on.
[240:25.44]I will.
[240:29.70]I need a... I need a... Oh, here's one on the ground.
[240:47.75]Okay.
[240:49.58]We got our onions.
[240:51.72]Are you happy you had the onions?
[240:53.22]Are you glad you had the onions?
[240:55.30]Crispy onions.
[240:56.04]They gotta be crispy.
[240:57.52]Are you happy you had the onions?
[241:00.94]Alright, now I need the... Wait, where'd it go?
[241:05.10]Wait, what?
[241:06.56]Wait, did I put an onion in there?
[241:09.16]What happened to the cheese?
[241:14.58]Oh, it's not.
[241:15.00]There it is.
[241:18.23]Okay, let's go.
[241:19.77]So now the mozzarella and the onions blend together a little bit.
[241:26.37]I want little clusters too.
[241:27.97]Clusters, clusters, clusters, clusters, clusters, clusters, extra cheese, extra cheesy, cheesy, cheesy, cheesy.
[241:36.00]And then bacon.
[241:44.45]Although, I'm not a fan of this style.
[241:46.01]I'd rather it be, like, cubed or, like, finely chopped bacon.
[241:53.68]Now, if there were peppers here, too, I would put peppers on this, too.
[241:57.68]Just green peppers.
[242:00.72]So, you get that onions.
[242:02.68]The onions get caramelized.
[242:04.45]You get the bacon.
[242:05.63]You get the... I mean, why?
[242:07.37]No, no, you don't need garlic on here.
[242:13.27]You tell me how good this looks.
[242:15.67]when it comes out.
[242:17.60]Cubed bacon?
[242:18.34]Yeah, it's just easier because you don't, it's easier to bite into.
[242:20.30]I'm going to make a fucking fucked up pizza next.
[242:36.42]I'm going to chop up.
[242:40.54]I'm just going to make like a turkey.
[242:42.24]I'm going to make it like a chicken.
[242:46.85]Put wood on it.
[242:54.58]This isn't the fucked up pizza?
[242:58.14]Oh, you know what?
[242:58.60]Hamburger and onion is one of my other favorites, but I don't have hamburger and onion, so we're going to do bacon and onion.
[243:12.03]That's not pizza.
[243:12.81]What?
[243:12.91]What?
[243:17.41]And again, we're not going to take this out yet.
[243:18.67]We're going to leave it in for a few minutes.
[243:27.47]Don't put hamburger on pizza.
[243:29.11]Why?
[243:32.81]Ground hamburger you don't like?
[243:36.28]I always thought people liked that.
[243:40.44]There you go.
[243:42.57]You see, you've got, this one doesn't look as good because the game's like that.
[243:49.11]What you have here is the onions are underneath the cheese.
[243:54.11]So look, you get like onion surprise.
[243:58.79]It does look like little dog poops.
[244:05.17]Dog poop pizza.
[244:06.31]Okay.
[244:18.19]Make that IRL.
[244:19.07]Okay, let's make a super cheese pizza.
[244:29.35]I want to make a grilled cheese pizza.
[244:31.35]I'm going to put two pizzas on top of each other.
[244:34.71]Yes, that's what I'm doing.
[244:47.51]Let us make the pizza.
[244:48.97]You will in a minute.
[245:00.27]Okay.
[245:03.49]I want to make my grilled cheese pizza.
[245:10.44]The grilled cheese pizza is going to be, uh, I want just to like, I just want tomato sauce right in the middle.
[245:19.01]Tomato sauce right in the middle.
[245:23.03]And then we're going to get the cheese slices.
[245:30.17]I need a lot more than this.
[245:35.27]My basket.
[245:43.91]Is that cheddar?
[245:55.45]Okay.
[245:57.83]Yeah, I'm making a grilled cheese pizza.
[245:59.44]Alright, slice it up.
[246:07.94]What's wrong with this?
[246:11.09]These bunkers.
[246:11.99]I'm making one... Why is there bacon in here?
[246:15.29]Get this fucking bacon out of here.
[246:16.83]Alright.
[246:34.39]Grind this up.
[246:41.93]rate it no I wanted that slices for the for the for like a grilled cheese by the way people that'll be like what do you what what the is this like what do you think this is so weird I guarantee you there's like some weird stupid food blog channel that's like whoa look we got the weirdest thing ever we got a grilled cheese pizza you don't think this exists somewhere
[247:12.82]You don't think that they took like two bites of that and then ate no more of it?
[247:29.47]An ungodly amount of cheese.
[247:38.42]More cheese.
[247:40.04]More cheese needed for the grilled cheese pizza.
[247:50.65]Oh, that's a lot of cheese.
[248:01.65]Two kilogram.
[248:02.92]Okay, how much is a kilogram?
[248:05.18]This is a lot.
[248:06.90]This is actually like an extreme amount, isn't it?
[248:26.15]A hundred pounds of cheese pizza?
[248:39.88]If you walked in here and the person that you saw doing this was doing this, I would think that they were serving this as an appetizer plate.
[248:47.68]Like you had a, you were, this is like the amount of cheese that you would expect on a plate if there was a wedding party out here.
[248:59.66]It's just, it's just cheddar slices.
[249:03.60]What a shitty wedding appetizer.
[249:06.62]Oh, I wonder what they're gonna have out on the serving tray.
[249:09.61]Oh, bacon-wrapped scallops?
[249:11.33]Oh, dates?
[249:12.73]No, no, it's slices of cheddar cheese out of the package.
[249:20.31]You know, a long time ago, I really wanted, and I don't know, you might think I'm insane, but, like, I've heard people doing, like, fun items, like, oh, like, fast food items, or, like, oh, we have a bunch of McDonald's french fries or something.
[249:34.11]I was like, you know, that's kind of cool.
[249:37.68]If I ever got married, I think it'd be kind of fun to have like a, I don't know, like, like a McDouble station.
[249:47.54]No, not like, okay.
[249:48.83]And that is sort of like it, but alright.
[249:50.51]Listen, just for fun.
[249:52.45]Like it's not the dinner.
[249:53.53]It's not the meal.
[249:54.79]You can just have one if you want.
[250:01.31]Just a single, no, not a double, not a McDouble, sorry.
[250:04.21]Just a plain McDonald's cheeseburger in the wrapper.
[250:09.80]And like there's a person walking around with a waiter or a waitress that has like a stack of single McDonald's cheeseburger.
[250:19.82]It'd be like, I don't know, if I was at a wedding, and they had like single McDonald's cheeseburgers, like, just think of how fucking hungry you are before the wedding is going on.
[250:28.67]You gotta wait a long-ass time to eat at a wedding.
[250:30.93]A long time.
[250:33.29]Sometimes you're starving, and you gotta wait another six hours before you eat.
[250:38.47]And sometimes the people that are catering the wedding take even longer, and it's like a bunch of delays, and then finally you get your salmon that comes out, right?
[250:46.60]Right?
[250:49.25]I'm sorry, but when after the ceremony is over by like 11, 12 o'clock in the afternoon, I'm ready to eat.
[250:55.15]And I'm not ready to eat like one shrimp that's on a skewer that you walk by with.
[251:00.01]That's not enough.
[251:01.43]If you had a single McDonald's cheeseburger just walking around, I'd be like, holy shit, this is awesome.
[251:05.69]This is the best wedding I've ever been to in my life.
[251:07.33]This is incredible.
[251:09.65]No judgments, no bullshit.
[251:10.97]Just like, oh yeah, there's just single McDonald's cheeseburgers.
[251:14.44]Yeah, give me two of those right now.
[251:16.38]I'll take two right now.
[251:20.06]And then guess what?
[251:20.50]I'm going to eat the dinner later too.
[251:21.42]I'm going to eat the foal, salmon, and whatever, the chicken breast.
[251:30.53]You're a corporate.
[251:31.37]No, I'm not.
[251:32.11]I just, I like that idea.
[251:40.61]How?
[251:40.91]That's not a shill.
[251:42.16]I like McDonald's cheeseburgers.
[251:46.66]What?
[251:47.12]What's so wrong?
[251:47.82]Okay, sure.
[251:49.00]Everybody, yell at me.
[251:50.10]I like McDonald's cheeseburgers.
[251:51.74]I like them.
[251:52.74]I like them, okay?
[251:53.88]I really like them.
[252:05.00]I like, and I like, I like how they smell.
[252:07.23]Okay?
[252:09.51]Listen to me.
[252:20.93]Okay, I gotta settle down.
[252:22.51]I gotta settle down.
[252:24.93]I'm adding more and more people to the list of... Is everything okay in Jeremy's world?
[252:30.49]Yes, everything is fine.
[252:31.59]Everything's gonna be fine.
[252:43.02]Every time I talk about this, I add like another group of people that are like concerned about my well-being.
[252:52.13]I would do the McDonald's thing.
[252:53.09]I would.
[252:53.43]For real.
[252:54.03]No jokes.
[252:54.99]No fucking around.
[253:06.16]Okay.
[253:06.74]Wait a minute.
[253:08.06]I want you guys to yell at me over this one too.
[253:10.52]Forget about single McDonald's cheeseburgers.
[253:12.58]Great idea.
[253:14.46]What if it was Pizza Hut breadsticks?
[253:18.13]So many of you guys talking so much crap right now.
[253:21.29]You would know.
[253:22.51]No way would you be like, what do you mean no?
[253:24.57]What?
[253:26.31]It's worse?
[253:30.65]What about the red lobster rolls?
[253:32.61]What about the cheddar biscuits?
[253:39.53]I just need one more layer over here.
[253:44.24]Olive Garden breadsticks.
[253:50.97]Yeah, I mean, something like that.
[253:52.64]Just like a breadstick from one of those restaurants.
[253:55.98]Is that okay?
[253:57.42]Would that be good?
[254:01.16]What if the soup, salad, and breadsticks was the appetizer before the meal?
[254:05.73]For the cocktail hour?
[254:08.91]That would be awesome.
[254:19.73]Yeah, alright, well, none of you were invited to my wedding.
[254:23.52]I'm gonna have a wicked, I'm gonna have, I'm gonna have McDonald's cheeseburgers.
[254:26.20]I'm gonna have soup salads and breadsticks.
[254:29.10]I'm gonna, I'm gonna, and by the way, we're eating dessert first.
[254:32.32]We're eating dessert first at my wedding.
[254:34.52]That's right, ice cream first.
[254:45.99]It's just a kid wedding.
[254:48.08]Kid, child wedding.
[254:51.76]Chuck E. Cheese.
[255:00.48]Well, imagine if all you guys got invited to my wedding.
[255:02.91]Imagine if I had 10,000 people on the guest list.
[255:13.40]We would have to have that wedding in like a, like a toothpaste factory.
[255:18.63]We'd have to stuff everybody in a bunch of like a warehouse, like a stadium.
[255:26.36]We would need like a thousand acres of like factory warehouse space.
[255:42.17]Each chair has a box of toothpaste under it.
[255:44.93]What?
[255:47.84]Have a wedding at Chuck E. Cheese.
[255:49.06]Anyways, you guys don't understand.
[255:55.24]Wedding at Chuck E. Cheese.
[255:57.48]It's like one of the biggest marketing ploys ever.
[255:59.90]You know how much money they would give me to do that?
[256:02.07]You know how much money I would get to have a wedding at Chuck E. Cheese on camera?
[256:08.27]That's got to be worth tons of money.
[256:10.68]Because I'm throwing away a huge part of my life there.
[256:14.62]I'm literally disintegrating an incredibly major important thing in my entire life.
[256:27.30]It would just be going away.
[256:31.99]Five Nights at Freddy's.
[256:37.47]Chuck E. Cheese says poggers.
[256:38.83]Yeah, and he would officiate the wedding.
[256:42.55]And he better talk.
[256:45.13]I'm gonna be real.
[256:45.71]He better talk.
[256:54.94]And he better give us free tokens for getting married. ...
[257:19.49]20 free tokens to the bride and groom okay alright alright let's make the grilled cheese three basic ingredients of grilled cheese and you're forgetting one of them
[257:48.31]What's the other ingredient to a grilled cheese besides cheese, bread, and a tomato?
[257:53.69]What's the secret ingredient?
[257:58.29]Butter?
[258:05.91]Yeah, sorry.
[258:06.53]I didn't coat my... I didn't coat it with butter.
[258:13.42]I got it.

[258:14.12]I got it.
[258:14.44]I got it.
[258:14.72]I got it.
[258:15.00]I got it.
[258:17.98]Tomato on a grilled cheese is a staple.

[258:21.63]Hold on.
[258:25.91]Wait, wait, wait.
[258:28.87]Let me back up here.
[258:30.65]No, I agree with you.
[258:32.19]I don't like tomato on my grilled cheeses, but I know that a lot of people... Am I gaslighting myself?
[258:36.85]I know that people put tomato on grilled cheese all the time.
[258:40.41]I did it because if I didn't put a tomato on the grilled cheese, I thought people would be like, where the fuck's the tomato?
[258:47.29]That's why I put it on.
[258:49.81]Alright, I need a butter.
[258:50.51]I just need a butter sauce.
[258:53.38]Butter.
[258:59.78]It's yeast.
[259:00.26]I have to buy it, right?
[259:02.76]I'm actually really glad that didn't break.
[259:23.39]Oh shit, there's a bunch of other crap in here.
[259:25.47]Trash, trash, trash, trash, trash it, trash it.
[259:31.86]What?
[259:43.97]Crap.
[259:44.83]Crap, crap, crap, crap.

[260:32.13]Get it in there.
[260:37.79]Oh, shit.
[260:38.15]Is it still cooking?
[260:38.83]No, it's not cooking.
[260:39.38]Okay.
[260:42.28]Alright.
[260:42.74]Grilled cheese.
[260:43.52]Let's go.
[261:06.94]Too hot, too hot, too hot.
[261:07.82]Not that hot.
[261:11.34]Lighter.
[261:22.59]Incinerate this.
[261:23.53]No, why?
[261:24.13]It took so long to place it all.
[261:34.76]Okay.
[261:56.28]Alright, here we go.
[262:25.66]Get over there.
[262:30.21]Make it talk.
[262:33.57]I can't make it talk.
[262:39.36]Hey, kids.
[262:42.64]You want me to just make it say, hey, kids?
[262:58.36]I just, like, scoop slammed it.
[263:03.28]What?
[263:03.72]Why did it bounce off?
[263:07.54]Oh, shit.
[263:08.12]It almost went on.
[263:20.02]I'm trying just to flip it over so it's a grilled cheese.
[263:26.00]Wait.
[263:26.26]Okay, hold on.
[263:31.22]Don't go in the trash.
[263:37.93]Fuck.
[263:50.07]Fuck.
[264:00.15]Come on.
[264:02.54]Actually kinda looks kinda good.
[264:08.49]That's close, hold on.
[264:10.61]Scrape it a little.
[264:20.73]This thing's so huge.
[264:22.24]I have to do this on the floor.
[264:43.45]Oh, look at that.
[264:44.09]Here we go.
[264:44.73]Almost done.
[265:01.02]Shit, it's almost there.
[265:13.83]Come on, get up.
[265:28.48]Get off.
[265:34.38]I don't care.
[265:39.57]Don't, whatever.
[265:45.33]Alright, what's an actual pizza I need to do?
[265:46.65]I don't know.
[265:49.19]Let's find out.
[265:51.31]Oh, this guy's waiting a long time for this.
[265:55.67]I hate this pizza.
[265:56.57]Oh, it sucks.
[265:59.95]Excuse me.. Yeah?
[266:01.90]I've been waiting like two or three hours for my mushroom pizza.
[266:09.20]Right on that, sir.
[266:20.38]Okay, I need mushrooms.
[266:21.22]I gotta get mushrooms, mushrooms, mushrooms.
[266:24.86]We're closing.
[266:25.52]Oh, fuck.
[266:27.88]He just has both of his arms hanging down onto the window, just waiting.
[266:31.83]We're closed.
[266:32.49]I didn't even... This is like the super rich, rich kid that wanted a pizza shop.
[266:39.61]And instead of just bringing the kid to, like, Play-Doh class where they could just mess around, his parents bought him a pizza shop so he could make his own fucked up pizzas.
[266:59.01]Okay, button mushrooms.
[267:00.01]I need more of these.
[267:06.48]This is like an old Macaulay Culkin movie.
[267:26.48]Wait, was Macaulay Culkin in Richie Rich or was that a different kid?
[267:29.34]There's cheddar in here.
[267:36.69]There's so much cheese in here.
[267:37.71]Hold on.
[267:46.86]You're a dinosaur?
[267:47.78]I mean, Richie Rich came out in like 1995.
[267:52.04]That's not that far away.
[267:54.50]That's not that long ago.
[267:58.82]I think I called a dinosaur.
[268:01.02]What is this?
[268:01.44]That's older than I am.
[268:14.43]So?
[268:14.65]Alright, let's make this dude's pizza.
[268:23.46]So he wants...
[268:26.12]A Neapolitan marinara and some cut mozzarella.
[268:32.76]Small.
[268:33.46]Oh, look at that.
[268:34.56]Perfect size right here.
[268:46.59]There's a two-week-old marinara.
[268:53.97]Never coming back here again.
[268:56.28]Ever.
[269:06.21]Was it 60?
[269:07.15]Yeah, 60.
[269:07.65]Okay, then we have button mushrooms.
[269:15.79]Where the heck are those?
[269:20.36]He wants 30 grams.
[269:27.43]Okay, and then basil.
[269:28.43]Why does everybody put basil on all their pizzas?
[269:30.91]Stop basil on everything.
[269:32.49]Basil, basil, basil, basil, basil, basil.
[269:38.06]Oh, don't do that.
[269:44.78]Alright, that's it.
[269:46.50]Sir?
[269:46.74]There you go.
[269:56.19]It's a garnish?
[269:57.71]Learn to have taste.
[270:00.05]Oh, so it's a thing I remove from my food before I eat it.
[270:03.02]I call that a waste.
[270:18.15]Are you going to put parsley on the side?
[270:19.43]No, no, no.

[276:09.27]This is just dead air.
[276:11.33]Well, I'm focused.
[276:12.39]I was focusing on dumping a gasoline chamber into this chamber.
[276:31.57]He hates streaming.
[276:32.81]No, I don't.
[276:36.25]Stop it.
[276:37.03]Stop it.
[276:37.89]Silence them.
[276:41.47]That's enough.
[276:42.65]Holy shit.
[276:43.25]It didn't break.
[276:45.89]And then now we need yeast.
[276:48.11]Let's kind of see what happens, to be honest.
[276:56.45]Okay.
[277:02.93]You've got salt.
[277:03.62]Ooh, right, right, right, right.
[277:33.67]Oh, it's actually stuck in there.
[277:45.30]I can't make any more dough.
[277:46.36]I don't think ever again.
[277:47.22]Unless I... Hold on.
[277:52.59]Oh, bingo.
[277:54.89]Alright, I'm going to actually... Let's... Hold on.
[277:58.19]Clean up a little bit.
[277:59.31]I want to actually do... I want to do one more day of pizzas and I'm going to actually do it well.
[278:05.42]I want to do an actual day of pizza.
[278:12.64]At least I got to pick my favorite pizza.
[278:16.22]Happy about that.
[278:16.76]Alright.
[278:17.22]I need, what do I need more of?
[278:18.36]Let's see.
[278:22.25]I have plenty of, plenty of chicken, plenty of sweet corn, which nobody's tried to eat yet.
[278:29.26]I could use more Italian sausages.
[278:30.86]I could use more mushrooms.
[278:33.56]I could use more bacon and marinara sauce.
[278:36.26]And just get all the meats.
[278:46.12]So let's do pepperoni.
[278:48.75]Italian sausages.
[278:52.47]Prosciutto.
[278:54.59]More salami.
[278:55.23]More bacon.
[278:59.78]Some, uh, whatever this is.
[279:06.82]Uh, I'll take some gorgonzola, sure.
[279:11.52]Capers.
[279:15.81]Mmm.
[279:17.97]What else?
[279:20.05]Some young artichokes.
[279:23.45]Couple more.
[279:23.83]Just so I can have a tray of them.
[279:26.59]Cherry tomatoes, just so I can have a tray of them.
[279:29.38]A bunch of lettuce.
[279:29.90]Shredded lettuce on pizza.
[279:34.56]I don't know about that.
[279:35.72]That sounds kind of gross.
[279:37.52]But I'm going to get it nonetheless.
[279:41.50]Tuna on pizza.
[279:43.60]Also, I'm not a fan of that.
[279:44.80]I don't think it seems kind of gross.
[279:47.62]Like, just tuna?
[279:49.30]Like, raw tuna?
[279:50.87]I don't know.
[279:57.87]Alright, now I gotta figure out what I wanna do with this.
[280:04.29]Need counter space.
[280:06.31]Okay, we're gonna do shredded lettuce.
[280:12.81]I need a container.
[280:13.95]I'm too lazy to go find one, so I'm just gonna buy one.
[280:24.29]Well, I guess you can only chop the lettuce, you can't shred it.
[280:33.77]All of that's going to go on the floor.
[280:34.91]Mark my words.
[280:36.79]Sure.
[280:38.83]I disagree.
[280:39.33]Okay.
[280:49.45]That's enough lettuce.
[280:52.69]Do you chop up the tuna fish or do you just... What do you... Shredded tuna?
[281:00.18]I can't put this in it.
[281:01.06]Why do I have... What's this for?
[281:05.36]can't chop it what can I do with it I can put it into the mixer we're stream 20 what are you wait what what are you talking about you don't put it in the mixer what the why do you put it in the in the food processor
[281:34.09]So you just blend it up?
[281:36.07]Wait a minute.
[281:38.07]Okay, well, I lost that tuna.
[281:46.74]Wait, did somebody just say do something weird?
[281:48.46]I just spent like 40 minutes making a fucking grilled cheese pizza.
[281:51.40]What?
[281:57.04]What?
[282:02.83]How can I not open this?
[282:03.69]Oh, there's still lettuce in there.
[282:12.33]I missed the grilled cheese.
[282:13.71]Do it again.
[282:14.27]Oh, we're going to make a second grilled cheese pizza.
[282:20.82]Two.
[282:21.32]Two grilled cheese pizzas.
[282:32.25]And then, artichokes.
[282:36.91]I'm preparing for tomorrow, so I don't have to do this.
[282:38.97]So I'm not going to run around from place to place and be like, oh my god, I need artichokes.
[282:42.55]And I sprint down and pick up onions instead of artichokes and I fuck the whole thing up.
[282:59.22]That doesn't seem like a lot.
[283:00.40]That's not enough.
[283:03.97]It's just a can of capers.
[283:04.89]Alright, Italian sausages.
[283:06.03]Alright, let's go, go, go.
[283:16.85]Alright, let's go.
[283:20.45]You're making me want to play this?
[283:21.43]It's pretty fun.
[283:31.82]Alright, give me a pizza.
[283:33.24]I didn't even make any dough.
[283:35.72]Oh, wait, I have this medium pizza here.
[283:39.19]Alright, I hope all the pizzas are mediums today.
[283:41.57]You want Italian pizza.
[283:43.77]Italian pizza is Neapolitan dough.
[283:46.75]It's a medium marinara salami.
[283:48.43]I got all of that.
[283:48.99]Let's go.
[283:52.31]Roll it up.
[283:55.65]Marinara sauce.
[283:59.30]Do another comb stream, asshat.
[284:01.92]Well, I'll tell you one way to make sure that I don't do the thing you just said is to immediately call me an asshat after you request something.
[284:09.41]That's the fastest way for me to go.
[284:10.87]Nah, I don't think so.
[284:13.03]That's like the fastest way for that to happen.
[284:20.74]Okay.
[284:22.70]Cut mozzarella, which is up here.
[284:31.94]Pog.
[284:33.52]Cut salami.
[284:35.70]I think I still have... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[284:37.28]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[284:41.77]64 grams.
[284:42.65]Done.
[284:42.91]Italian sausages.
[284:44.83]I have a few left, don't I?
[284:46.29]I do.
[284:47.65]Sick.
[284:50.51]50 grams of Italian sausages.
[284:51.77]Do I have enough?
[284:52.39]Please tell me I have enough.
[284:54.64]I do.
[284:55.64]And then cut chili peppers.
[284:57.38]I don't have... You want ketchup on there?
[285:01.09]No, don't do it.
[285:02.69]Pick it up, though.
[285:03.33]Disgusting.
[285:08.97]Chili peppers.
[285:12.15]They are.
[285:12.49]Okay.
[285:12.89]How many does he want?
[285:13.91]30 grams?
[285:14.17]You just want one.
[285:14.69]Okay, chop it up.
[285:19.02]Do another 3DO stream.
[285:20.64]Asshat.
[285:24.98]No, no, no.
[285:25.44]There's a fucking goddamn artichoke in there.
[285:27.92]Fuck.
[285:29.02]This is why I needed to prepare.
[285:37.78]Why can't I just reach out, reach in and take it out?
[285:39.78]Alright, it is, it's, I think I might have to put it on the floor.
[285:47.73]They were right.
[285:48.35]All of it is on the floor, but for very good reason.
[285:50.99]So I can see it better.
[286:03.04]Just give me this.
[286:03.90]What are all these?
[286:21.64]Stop calling him an asshat.
[286:23.27]He's so mean, guys.
[286:28.33]Why are you so mean?
[286:30.25]What's with the meanness?
[286:31.47]Why are you so mean?
[286:39.31]Mean, mean, mean, mean, mean.
[286:51.22]Artichokes?
[286:52.72]Don't worry, I'm making it.
[286:53.88]Your pizza is almost ready.
[287:03.39]Play a children's game for three days in a row?
[287:05.09]I think I've done that before.
[287:14.12]Okay.
[287:14.94]So you want 30 grams of chili peppers.
[287:16.90]I can do that.
[287:20.15]Should we put a ton of it, like, hidden somewhere over here so he bites into it and goes... Oh!
[287:26.61]Dirty.
[287:26.85]Okay.
[287:30.87]That's evil.
[287:36.36]Is it evil?
[287:45.04]You literally only play children's games.
[287:47.02]I don't...
[287:49.67]That's not even accurate and you'd know it.
[287:51.17]What do you mean it's not done?
[287:58.04]Mozzarella?
[287:58.48]Salami?
[288:00.12]Oh, there's olives on this damn thing.
[288:02.54]Anytime I see the word olive, I just glaze over it.
[288:06.44]Quick, get it out, get it out, get it out, get it out.
[288:17.08]I have a jar of black olive somewhere.
[288:18.52]Where is it?
[288:30.90]Shit.
[288:38.28]Olives, olives, olives.
[288:38.98]Come on, come on, come on.
[288:45.24]Oh, shit.
[288:45.62]How do I take them out?
[288:48.26]Um... I... What do I put these?
[288:56.30]I swear to God, if there's something in here already, I'm going to be very mad.
[289:06.53]Thank God.
[289:06.91]Okay, there's not.
[289:08.15]We're good.
[289:19.30]You're eating olives from the jar right now.
[289:22.40]Nice.
[289:24.26]That's pretty cool.
[289:26.14]They're good for you.
[289:27.20]I just don't like them.
[289:32.95]64 grams of black olives.
[289:43.85]Holy fuck, that was too much.
[289:46.10]Whatever.
[289:58.56]Black olives on a pizza are bad.
[289:59.76]Just, olives in general, I like, I love olive oil, but black olives, especially, they're very, they're like acidic.
[290:09.51]They have a super, like, sour-y kind of flavor to them.
[290:18.30]They're like... Not for me.
[290:24.20]Not for me.
[290:27.04]Black olives are better than green olives?
[290:31.45]I actually kind of... I don't mind green olives.
[290:34.85]If they're on a charcuterie board or something.
[290:45.01]That was a truth bomb, bro.
[290:48.92]Thanks, I guess.
[290:51.12]We have a new offer.
[290:53.36]I don't click on new offer links unless it is confirmed that it is a actual new offer.

[292:11.36]It doesn't even matter what the pizzas are.
[292:12.44]They're getting bread.
[292:17.71]Oh no, I got my ketchup in the fucking onion tray.
[292:21.63]What do you mean it doesn't count?
[292:27.10]You didn't say I had to make their pizzas correctly.
[292:28.64]You just said I had to make them.
[292:40.60]And here's one right here.
[292:42.59]How much is this worth?
[292:46.82]How can I see the price?
[292:48.68]Okay.
[292:50.04]How much was it?
[292:53.00]190 cents.
[292:54.00]Oh, that's not very much times 200.
[292:57.08]Okay.
[293:00.96]Let's go.
[293:03.93]Next up we have, uh, a mimosa pizza, which is Alfredo sauce is a Neapolitan Alfred.
[293:11.23]It doesn't, it doesn't matter.
[293:20.75]Give that back.
[293:21.15]What are you doing?
[293:23.91]Give this back.
[293:24.45]What the hell?
[293:31.19]Give my tray back.
[293:37.38]What's going on?
[293:44.32]Give me a fucking break.
[293:45.56]Are you kidding me?
[293:48.98]Is something blocking it?
[293:51.30]Something in the way?
[294:00.82]Okay, Mimosa, you want onions on there.
[294:05.88]You want bacon on there, too?
[294:07.20]I didn't even put any sauce on there.
[294:09.12]Deal with it.
[294:10.36]That's a Turbo 985 special.
[294:11.92]Onions and bacon.
[294:14.12]What did you want on yours?
[294:16.66]Oh, pesto?
[294:17.98]You got it.
[294:20.62]Oh, and way too many hot peppers, so it's going to burn the fuck out of your mouth, and you won't even be able to enjoy anything.
[294:28.57]Pesto and hot peppers, that's too much acidity in your mouth.
[294:33.11]That'll be $12.
[294:33.57]And I'm giving you a chicken breast.
[294:38.24]You're just getting a hot pie.
[294:39.36]Okay, where are the potatoes?
[294:54.61]It's like you dumped out what was the contents of your shredder.
[294:59.04]Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[295:03.81]Hurry, hurry.
[295:04.29]It's not even going to fit in there.
[295:26.79]It's Timmy's school project.
[295:30.63]It's like paper mache.
[295:33.82]Yeah, he made a paper mache solar system.
[295:36.02]It's like, ah, Timmy, that does not look at all like our galaxy.

[296:40.49]Alright, I need plates, plates, plates, quick.
[297:00.81]Alright, this is like a plant that's in the corner of your office.
[297:04.64]Alright, who ordered the mimosa?
[297:12.25]You just hear off in the distance. $125.
[297:34.88]Why would they eat it?
[297:35.58]They didn't.
[297:37.80]They just saw it.
[297:55.60]And this is a meat pizza.
[297:58.40]What's next?
[297:58.90]More, more, more, more, more.
[298:02.25]Oh no, I didn't like it.
[298:03.36]I liked the sauce though.
[298:05.34]The cheese was not very good.
[298:08.14]But I was a big fan of the sauce.
[298:09.64]There was no sauce on that pizza.
[298:10.80]It was just shredded up hair.
[298:16.06]Oh, take it out.
[298:18.88]Where's my?
[298:28.69]That actually looks so awful.
[298:31.45]For real.
[298:35.05]I need another piece of dough.
[298:36.35]Here we go.
[298:39.39]Roll it.
[298:45.56]Okay.
[298:46.60]I don't know what you have lettuce too.
[298:49.26]And artichokes.
[298:52.80]And I have a lot of sweet corn, so might as well use it.
[299:00.42]and um I guess you can have here have some my golf no have some alfredo sauce and bacon okay I'm gonna I'm gonna do the middle finger in bacon
[299:30.64]Can I?
[299:30.88]Uh, not even close, but whatever.
[299:45.04]I think I could get it though.
[300:06.79]You've hit a bacon ceiling.
[300:08.15]Uh, I still have a shitload of chicken.
[300:20.56]Whatever, I don't care.
[300:34.82]Do you like this game, or do you just have Stockholm Syndrome?
[300:39.74]Um... No, it's fun.
[300:41.64]Alright, I have to spell fuck you out on this one.
[301:00.65]I need more peppers.
[301:01.81]Shit.
[301:11.13]Or do I, though?
[301:12.43]Do I, though?
[301:13.61]No, I don't.
[301:14.33]I can't put anything on here.
[301:45.36]This is done.
[301:45.98]It looks like a dead bird.
[301:52.05]It's disgusting.
[302:06.67]I just put a dead bird on the pizza.
[302:10.58]That's disgusting.
[302:11.78]That's disgusting.
[302:22.87]That is absolutely revolting.
[302:24.63]Oh.
[302:34.35]It just looks like charcoal.
[302:38.33]Well, we ran out of toppings.
[302:39.44]We ran out of meat.
[302:40.18]So might as well use some of the wood, the charcoal on the bottom.
[302:43.02]At least it'll be smoky.
[302:57.85]Dude, the health department would elbow drop you.
[303:04.21]Is this one done?
[303:04.91]It is.
[303:19.06]I think this is the end.
[303:24.53]I can't even, like, I can't even process this anymore.
[303:33.39]Oh, okay.
[303:38.08]I'm not done with the day.
[303:39.30]I'm just saying, like, I think this is it.
[303:42.68]No, I didn't... I didn't... I need... This is all medium pizzas.
[303:50.43]Whoa, that was in the head.
[303:51.35]Wait, was that... What was in there?
[303:52.63]Okay.
[304:00.53]One, two, three.
[304:19.50]this.
[304:22.98]This is what I feel like it would look like if McDonald's started doing pizza.
[304:33.41]What about the shit in the oven?
[304:34.61]Oh, whatever.
[304:35.13]I'll get it.
[304:35.47]Oh, that's a Caprice pizza.
[304:45.17]What's in here?
[304:48.54]You
[304:49.90]Okay.
[304:51.66]Sicko.
[304:52.80]I guess he liked it a little.
[304:53.90]He just didn't like the cheese.
[304:54.72]It's not burning.
[304:57.20]I need to put wood in here.
[304:59.86]Okay.
[305:00.19]This one's done.
[305:19.04]This just looks like, uh, what a baby's food tray looks like.
[305:25.72]An infant that you feed, like, Cheerios to.
[305:39.43]Baby spelling out fuck.
[305:47.57]I can't.
[305:48.23]I can't even.
[305:48.85]This is a cheese pizza.
[305:49.97]Is there even cheese on the pizza?
[305:52.07]Everything but cheese.
[305:58.39]You ordered a cheese pizza.
[306:00.19]You sure you didn't want corn and olives?
[306:03.23]Whatever the fuck it was.
[306:06.07]Alright, I'm like Mr. Giggles right now.
[306:07.99]I gotta calm down.
[306:23.85]You ever, sometimes you would just kind of sit there and go, you know, what would I actually do if somebody served me that?
[306:30.92]Here's what I would do.
[306:32.56]I would turn around.
[306:34.10]If somebody put this in front of me, here you go, sir and madam, here is your pizza.
[306:41.14]I'd go, okay, well, the way that you're, like, being, like, a waiter guy.
[306:43.51]Okay, where's the camera?
[306:44.65]I would look around and be like, there's probably a camera back here.
[306:46.67]There's a hidden camera there, a hidden camera there.
[306:49.19]Um, like, you're, like, an actor waiter.
[306:51.41]You already did that part.
[306:52.23]You came over and you were like, oh, sir, madam, I'm here with your pizza.
[306:55.35]Like, you're obviously an actor.
[306:56.91]So, that part, you gave it away already.
[307:10.10]Doesn't matter, they still paid for it.
[307:16.40]Ow, my hand.
[307:17.09]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[307:35.40]It kind of looks like a little guy holding like a brick.
[307:42.84]It's like a Little Rock guy holding up a rock.
[307:49.66]It's like a little dude and he's holding a rock in his hand.
[308:00.81]He's about to dunk the basketball.
[308:05.33]Whoa.
[308:06.13]Okay, cool.
[308:07.33]I like that one.
[308:08.29]I'm keeping this one.
[308:12.92]Nobody can have this one.
[308:13.76]This one's mine.
[308:20.86]How many orders do I have?
[308:21.68]Four?
[308:21.94]I don't have any dough left.
[308:26.67]Um... Let me just do this.
[308:38.53]Is it ketchup?
[308:57.84]I can't just serve ketchup on a plate.
[309:01.63]Look for dough.
[309:02.85]We're looking for dough on the ground.
[309:04.41]If you see it, let me know.
[309:06.86]Oh, there we go.
[309:27.82]Okay, there's tuna and... That's disgusting.
[309:30.84]Oh.
[309:33.16]Oh.
[309:34.04]I almost just gagged.
[309:36.69]Tuna, ketchup, and milk.
[309:44.11]Sure, why not?
[310:01.89]This caused me physical harm thinking about this.
[310:05.49]Oh boy.
[310:06.13]Okay, so we have our ketchup and tuna sauce with milk based.
[310:16.18]Okay.
[310:52.22]Oh no, out of ketchup.
[310:53.14]That might be bad.
[311:20.56]Just serve a piece of wood.
[311:22.34]I wish I could.
[311:23.36]What was even... Oh, it was ketchup.
[311:31.00]Oh, do you want ketchup and wood?
[311:33.42]I feel like that's the kind of shit that we're going to be eating when, like, the apocalypse happens.
[311:40.74]Did you eat your... Son, did you eat your wood?
[311:47.40]Just put some ketchup on it.
[311:48.80]That's, like, all we have left is just ketchup?
[311:54.32]God damn it.
[311:55.08]Hold on.
[311:58.42]I think I can do it.
[311:59.02]I'm going to try.
[312:02.27]I put some wood in the grinder.
[312:03.53]Can I make like a wood sauce?
[312:10.74]Hold on.
[312:11.14]Can I?
[312:12.08]I can't chop up the wood.
[312:13.44]I can't shred up the wood.
[312:24.28]Oh, well.
[312:25.52]Okay.
[312:25.94]Put this in.
[312:29.64]What is... Oh, that is extra sauce.
[312:31.70]Okay.
[312:34.70]Somebody said this looks like a crime scene.
[312:38.92]Yeah, let's break it down.
[312:39.90]Okay.
[312:43.69]So, let's say we came from here.
[312:46.29]We open the front door.
[312:46.99]Let's go.
[312:47.19]Let's open the front door.
[312:50.43]Where's the front door?
[312:50.95]Over here.
[312:51.17]Okay.
[312:52.35]So, we open up here.
[312:57.87]Okay.
[312:59.23]So very obviously, there was a struggle, right?
[313:02.17]There was some peppers in the ground.
[313:04.53]The person definitely had just gone downstairs to get something from the pantry, right?
[313:09.99]You've obviously filled the pantry with this, but it's on the ground now.
[313:12.73]Why is it on the ground?
[313:14.89]Window open.
[313:16.57]Why is the window open?
[313:17.37]Perpetrator may have escaped through the window in the second floor pantry and kitchen area.
[313:23.54]Coming through here,
[313:25.69]Perpetrator pissed on the ground, too.
[313:27.64]Marking his territory.
[313:28.56]Perpetrator could be a dog.
[313:31.14]Yep.
[313:32.16]Perpetrator could be a rabid dog.
[313:37.26]Guy was coming up from the pantry.
[313:38.59]Dog smelled the aroma.
[313:40.67]Rabid dog jumped through the window.
[313:41.97]Let's see what else.
[313:46.01]Oh, and there it is.
[313:49.65]This is two attacks probably at the same time.
[313:52.11]Bludgeoned by the dough case.
[313:54.89]Smashed his head right on here.
[313:57.39]His brain matter flew over all the way to the left side of the kitchen.
[314:02.99]There's no body.
[314:04.13]Where's the body?
[314:06.91]We're closing for today.
[314:08.23]Oh, get out of here.
[314:10.04]I'm busy.
[314:13.94]It's the pizza.
[314:14.64]It's the pizza.
[314:22.59]That's not a whole lot of... It's like blood on the counter.
[314:29.06]Blood on the counter.
[314:31.10]And... This dough looks really, really, really weird to me.
[314:35.10]Hold on, let me go down.
[314:38.18]Yep, okay.
[314:39.56]That's human flesh.
[314:41.74]Human flesh.
[314:46.10]Multiple piss wounds.
[314:47.50]Multiple, multiple blood stains.
[314:52.06]And then somebody baked somebody who was going to bake him into a pizza.
[314:58.64]What would you even think coming in here?
[315:08.71]Another open window.
[315:09.51]Escape through this window too.
[315:13.65]Nice band name.
[315:14.49]Multiple Pistons.
[315:15.33]I said that and everybody hated it.
[315:16.67]You said that and they all laughed.
[315:22.37]This looks like somebody just like chair shot at somebody.
[315:24.55]Just bang right in the back of the head like... This place is a fucking mess.
[315:35.47]Okay, let's cook this last pizza and then I'm done.
[315:38.59]I'm done.
[315:47.61]Oh, things don't break anymore, right?
[315:52.44]uh turn the heat up let's burn this let's burn this until like it actually sets the place on fire is my pizza shovel
[316:21.39]God, I have no idea.
[316:25.18]Oh, here it is.
[316:43.09]Too hot.
[316:44.05]Oven is too hot.
[316:46.99]We're getting to extreme levels of heat.
[316:51.56]Where's the gas tank?
[316:56.48]Where is the gas tank?
[316:58.95]Oh, right.
[316:59.35]It disappeared.
[317:00.07]Can I buy another one?
[317:15.29]What's the point of the gas tank?
[317:24.52]I can't put it anywhere.
[317:29.66]It's for gas, but gas to what?
[317:50.69]I don't think it can explode.
[317:59.90]It's a nerve agent.
[318:00.98]It's a nerve agent.
[318:09.64]Alright, let's get that pizza out of there.
[318:10.90]Mmm.
[318:11.64]Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, scrumptious.
[318:15.27]Mmm.
[318:26.22]Mmm.
[318:27.96]I actually kind of feel like this would be a weird appetizer at a really expensive restaurant.
[318:31.58]It doesn't really even look that bad.
[318:39.13]Extra sauce on there.
[318:53.72]Holy shit!
[318:54.54]What?
[318:54.96]What?
[318:56.40]What?
[318:58.45]That scared the absolute hell out of me.
[318:59.97]I didn't know you could do that.
[319:04.09]Oh, crime scene.
[319:07.16]Wow.
[319:08.62]This looks like a typical, typical game of I'm going to try to, I'm going to put a chair here and jump into the ceiling with my head.
[319:34.27]It must have been making a really, really crazy YouTube video.
[319:39.60]The guy got shredded.
[319:41.94]His body doesn't even exist.
[319:43.31]It's just blood.
[319:53.12]all the things you can break in this game the ceiling fan really you can't like blow up the oven where's the blood pizza here it is oh I gotta serve this to somebody right

[320:37.60]Oh.
[320:38.90]Oh well.
[320:41.97]We're closing.
[320:42.51]I have to... Wait.

[320:46.39]Cheese.
[320:48.29]Okay.
[320:48.63]Do I... I don't think... I don't have any more dough.
[320:56.91]I actually don't have any more dough.
[321:00.19]Ah, fuck.

[321:12.18]Oh!
[321:13.48]Yes!
[321:14.40]Yes!
[321:15.40]They're like slam dunk pizza.
[321:17.02]I forgot about slam dunk pizza.
[321:24.07]Wait, I want to see it one more time.
[321:34.71]I want to see it.
[321:35.25]There he goes.
[321:43.64]He's reaching out to do a big slam dunk.
[321:49.90]Oh, nice.
[321:50.79]Alright, cool.
[321:54.51]Here, you can have it.
[321:55.15]It's cheese pizza.
[322:10.73]I kind of don't want to sell it, but I have to.
[322:13.73]Didn't even have to.
[322:14.19]Alright.
[322:14.75]Nope.
[322:15.13]She has to take a plate.
[322:16.75]I get to keep the pizza.
[322:17.71]You motherfucker.
[322:18.49]It's mine.
[322:18.85]Alright.
[322:21.17]That was it.
[322:28.66]Billy is such a joke.
[322:29.58]Like, why do I have to do this?
[322:31.38]I can't just play the game normally.
[322:33.50]I have to like fucking make like piss stains everywhere.
[322:38.43]Alright, I'm out.
[322:39.63]I'm done.
[322:41.36]Let's see how much money I made.
[322:42.36]$765.
[322:49.66]So that's times 200.
[322:50.28]Which is... 70... That's not even... That's like nothing.
[323:05.09]In the grand scheme of the massive amount of debt, that's only $153,000.
[323:08.07]I thought it was going to be at least a million.
[323:19.90]It was honest work.
[323:22.94]153k is not bad.
[323:26.97]That cent's not... No, you can't take cents off of the debt.
[323:30.13]That doesn't make any sense.
[323:36.53]I was fucking around too much.
[323:37.57]Yeah.
[323:40.34]Alright.
[323:40.92]I will see you guys.
[323:45.52]Let me see.
[323:49.24]Today, Friday.
[323:53.53]I got something I got to do tomorrow.
[323:57.31]So there's something that I have to take care of tomorrow.
[324:06.09]I was going to go today and tomorrow, but something came up like it sometimes does.
[324:14.13]So, you know, here's what we'll probably do.
[324:17.43]I'll probably go.
[324:18.60]I'll probably do Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday this week coming up.
[324:22.30]Because I know I've done like one day, one day, one day, one day.
[324:27.82]Let's just, I'll take the weekend and then we'll come back and do Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
[324:35.26]Tomorrow, he's got something going on.
[324:37.60]No, I just have to take care of something.
[324:39.16]I hope you had fun.
[324:46.21]I did.
[324:47.95]I saw somebody say this is the worst stream of the year.
[324:49.51]And I was like, ban that guy.
[324:51.07]And everyone said, ban that guy.
[324:52.29]And then we banned him.
[324:55.92]What about Yakuza?
[324:56.56]Yeah, we'll probably just open on Monday with Yakuza.
[325:00.98]Because I feel like that's a stream that's going to take more than a day or two in a row.
[325:07.18]And I don't want to do what I did last time, which I played it for like three hours and it said, no, I'm done.
[325:12.78]Never coming back to that again.
[325:15.44]So I'm going to block out the time to play Yakuza for at least a day or two.
[325:24.47]That's not, that's gonna happen again.
[325:26.61]Well, that would be funny if it did.
[325:29.65]You would at least be able to say that that's what happened.
[325:33.64]Sly Cooper is gonna, don't worry.
[325:35.66]Sly Cooper is, I gotta get another PS3.
[325:39.74]Which, okay, let's make that decision right now, okay?
[325:43.01]I'm gonna put a poll in chat.
[325:44.35]Yakuza 0, Yakuza 7, or Yakuza Dragon?
[325:48.29]Let's make that choice now.
[325:53.00]Because I've been hearing all kinds of, don't play that one, play this one instead.
[325:55.96]This is, no, you should play Zero.
[325:58.36]It's probably the best one.
[325:59.40]Seven's the best one.
[326:00.46]Just play the new one.
[326:01.30]It's fun and it's like memeable or something, right?
[326:05.30]So let's just, let's get this out of the way now.
[326:07.84]So we can get this ready for Monday.
[326:12.86]Okay, I'm going to, Yakuza Zero?
[326:16.76]Yakuza 7.
[326:19.24]Is Yakuza 7 on PlayStation 4?
[326:20.60]Or is it on PS3?
[326:33.07]It's on PC.
[326:33.89]Oh, wow.
[326:34.31]Okay.
[326:37.13]Is Yakuza 0 on PC too?
[326:38.33]I know.
[326:39.42]It was PS4 only, wasn't it?
[326:49.22]Here come the subs for the day.
[326:50.27]Thanks, everybody.
[326:51.07]I really appreciate it, as always.
[326:57.05]Thanks for the insane amount of subs.
[327:03.51]End of the stream chat decides, yes, they do.
[327:07.84]Well, this seems to be very, very, very unanimous.
[327:12.88]Uh, this is like not even a contest.
[327:19.52]Seven is dragon.
[327:20.58]Wait, what?
[327:22.70]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[327:24.59]Hold on.
[327:24.97]New poll.
[327:25.39]Wait, wait, what?
[327:29.36]Yakuza 7 is the... Alright, wait, hold on, hold on.
[327:32.29]People might have been confused.
[327:33.95]I could do New Pole.
[327:34.59]New Pole, wait, just forget that one.
[327:40.15]People might have been like, I don't understand, I'm gonna just... Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[327:50.48]This is 0, or Yakuza 7.
[327:54.62]Okay, that's way easier.
[327:58.93]Click this one instead.
[328:01.81]Vote on that one.
[328:10.87]And still, that didn't really matter, did it?
[328:15.76]By an astronomical amount.
[328:24.32]Alright, so I streamed Yakuza 0 already.
[328:28.74]Should I just, should we just pretend that stream didn't happen and just start to just do it over the whole thing?
[328:34.08]What if I make the same jokes?
[328:36.34]What if I, like, make the same references?
[328:38.22]Can we just pretend like I didn't?
[328:39.82]I probably will.
[328:40.34]What if I make the same terrible jokes?
[328:49.12]Nobody will remember.
[328:50.06]It was kind of a long time ago, wasn't it?
[329:00.12]Alright, this is pretty clear.
[329:01.44]Yeah, so we'll just start Yakuza 0.
[329:06.73]And I will actually give it the time that it deserves this time, instead of three.
[329:09.83]Because remember, that's... Even after doing this kind of pulling back on streaming recently, four or five years ago, I only streamed for three hours a stream.
[329:19.77]Sometimes four.
[329:22.25]So, I only gave that game like three hours.
[329:31.82]Alright, I'll see you guys on Monday.
[329:33.10]We'll go Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
[329:34.24]Yakuza 0 opening on Monday.
[329:36.10]I'll see you guys later.
[329:40.44]Thanks for watching as always.
[329:41.68]Always a pleasure.
[329:43.24]Happy Thanksgiving to those of you that celebrated yesterday.
[329:49.21]Thank you.
[329:50.17]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[329:55.71]Why am I saying thank you to you?
[329:59.51]Happy Thanksgiving.
[330:00.23]Thank you.
[330:02.48]I guess, I mean, I am thankful for you.
[330:04.16]I am.
[330:06.32]Alright, let's do a raid.
[330:08.12]Let's do a raid.
[330:08.80]Let's go.
[330:09.62]We are going to raid.
[330:10.96]Oh, I mean, if Mr. Sark is live, they get raided.
[330:19.47]That's just how it works.
[330:21.05]He's playing Raft right now, which, tell me if it looks good.
[330:28.01]Mr. Sark is hilarious.
[330:28.95]Go watch him.
[330:32.19]He's been around for a long time.
[330:34.49]He's playing Raft.
[330:45.54]The Mr. Sark.
[330:48.74]And I'll see you guys soon.
[330:49.58]See you on Monday.
[330:53.82]Take care, guys.
[330:54.24]See you soon.
[331:33.08]Thank you.
