[00:00.77]Hi.
[00:02.55]So I'm realizing the tweet that I just put out sounds kind of weird.
[00:09.44]Relaxing for a bit with some stuffed animals.
[00:13.44]Am I just lying on my bed?
[00:14.64]With the camera pointed at me?
[00:18.62]With all of my stuffed animal friends?
[00:24.63]Anyways, hi guys.
[00:27.71]Welcome back.
[00:31.50]Kinda.
[00:32.66]Welcome back, kinda.
[00:38.88]I am not moved.
[00:40.64]I mean, I'm in the process.
[00:44.52]I actually haven't really had a moment to sit down until right now.
[00:51.16]This is like the first time I've sat down unless I was in bed sleeping.
[00:57.28]in about six days five days you can hey you can hear the rumor that's how you know but I just sat in this room it was all I'm just I'm not going anywhere he lied about canceling streaming wait what
[01:17.83]I 100% guaranteed there'd be a stream today.
[01:22.76]It was one... I mean, you cannot go back on a 100% guarantee.
[01:27.14]You'd get yourself in some trouble.
[01:29.46]What do you mean, ban that guy?
[01:32.29]Oh, right, I was supposed to ban somebody.
[01:33.91]That's right.
[01:34.47]I'm sorry, I've been all over the place these last five days.
[01:37.35]Someone's gonna get banned.
[01:38.93]They said, ban me if you do, right?
[01:41.57]Remember that name?
[01:44.79]Yeah, they were like, there's no way you're streaming on Saturday.
[01:47.18]I fucking guarantee it.
[01:48.68]Otherwise, ban me, dickhead or something, right?
[01:51.34]So ban that person, I guess.
[01:53.92]Turtle Toenail just gave 5,000 bits.
[01:56.28]We haven't even started.
[01:58.84]I wouldn't give me any money before I tell you what the plan is.
[02:01.05]You know what I'm saying?
[02:01.79]Let me just be really honest with you.
[02:04.71]Let me give you the plan first before anybody's like, he's back!
[02:08.17]There we are, he's back!
[02:10.89]Let's go over the plan first.
[02:12.80]Anyways...
[02:14.80]Thanks for the huge money, though, seriously.
[02:16.78]That's 5,000 bits.
[02:21.20]Appreciate it.
[02:22.04]I'm turtle toenail.
[02:23.86]They say, hey, do you... Hey, do you got a Mitch Hedberg?
[02:29.39]Oh, do I have a Mitch Hedberg impression?
[02:31.93]Oh, I was like, what?
[02:35.69]Uh, it's kind of... Mitch Hedberg's kind of hard to do.
[02:37.67]He's a fucking legendary comedian.
[02:39.45]Um...
[02:43.00]Mitch Hedberg is kinda like this.
[02:46.48]He talks about why the Pringles ga- No, I can't do it.
[02:49.82]I gotta do maybe a little bit.
[02:52.30]Uh, the answer is no.
[02:53.58]Uh, he's a legendary fucking comedian, some of the funniest shit ever.
[02:56.33]I cannot do an impression of Mitch Hedberg.
[02:57.83]I tried.
[03:03.83]Look, if somebody's- Alright, I'm seeing a lot of minus twos.
[03:06.71]If somebody's gonna give you $50 to attempt an impression, what am I gonna say?
[03:11.17]No?
[03:12.68]Alright, thanks for the $50.
[03:13.38]You know, I don't think I feel like saying one sentence for $50.
[03:19.34]Come on, man.
[03:21.00]Come on, Gwen.
[03:23.28]Can I see some come on, Gwen's here, please?
[03:24.52]You know what I mean?
[03:32.88]Why is nobody doing it?
[03:34.04]Oh, fuck, I forgot.
[03:34.88]Pre-stream chat is not every single person that watches this channel.
[03:37.46]Sorry.
[03:40.75]I seriously, like, forget that.
[03:46.25]Anyways, so here's the deal.
[03:48.43]Here's the deal.
[03:51.68]It's been a lot of... It's been slow going.
[03:53.96]Let's just put it that way.
[03:56.54]And it's going to take a lot longer than initially anticipated to actually move.
[04:01.87]So because of all the coronavirus stuff and social distancing and all that shit, we're trying to do this right and we're trying to do it in a way that we're all comfortable and everything.
[04:11.12]So we're not really ready yet.
[04:15.21]We are, but we aren't.
[04:18.76]So, uh, streams for the next few days.
[04:22.24]I'm gonna be streaming.
[04:23.84]But they're only gonna be three to four hours each for the next few days.
[04:27.78]This is temporary until all this is kind of... We can get where we need to be, you know what I mean?
[04:34.96]So... That's the way it is.
[04:38.11]So hold off on your $50 donations.
[04:41.75]Fuck, somebody already did it right.
[04:43.63]So what we're going to do, we're going to relax.
[04:44.83]I haven't really had a time to relax.
[04:46.03]Like I said, I haven't stopped moving.
[04:48.32]So we're going to play Viva Piñata.
[04:50.72]Trouble in Paradise is the one everyone wanted me to play.
[04:52.66]Here comes the hype train.
[04:57.45]Why don't you just try moving harder?
[04:59.21]It won't be that easy.
[05:06.57]But!
[05:07.71]Uh, anyways.
[05:09.15]Let's get going.
[05:09.57]We're gonna play Viva Piñata.
[05:10.55]Trouble in Paradise.
[05:11.65]Jerma sucks.
[05:12.25]Gave 10 community subs.
[05:13.25]This guy sucks.
[05:14.45]Well, not you.
[05:15.23]Me.
[05:15.49]Because that's what you're referring to.
[05:19.23]So, short streams over the next few days.
[05:22.29]We'll get back to normal here soon, I promise.
[05:24.83]But not immediately.
[05:27.66]Not immediately.
[05:31.64]Here it is.
[05:32.34]Trouble in Paradise.
[05:33.64]So this is the good one, right?
[05:34.60]This is the one that everybody wanted me to play.
[05:39.17]This is the good one.
[05:43.63]You don't have an active gamer profile.
[05:46.85]Yeah, I do.
[05:47.27]What are you talking about?
[06:07.77]No, I don't care about Xbox Live.
[06:18.46]When you change your gamer profile, you'll be returned to the title screen.
[06:20.86]Enjoy your time with Viva Piñata.
[06:23.54]Trouble in Paradise.
[06:28.24]I'm not gonna fucking do that.
[06:29.32]I don't care.
[06:29.74]Because I haven't like paid for Xbox Live in probably like nine months or something.
[06:37.22]I already did this.
[06:44.42]No, I'm saying I don't have it.
[06:46.70]I don't own Xbox Live right now.
[06:49.53]I consolidated all of my subscription services.
[06:52.31]What is it going to be a warning for?
[06:55.19]Autosave, yeah.
[06:56.01]There's a big donut in the middle.
[06:58.33]Another 5,000 bits just came in.
[07:03.21]Uh, you missed my pre-stream bits, but they're irrelevant now due to the poll being closed.
[07:10.82]Oh, God.
[07:11.69]Thanks for the 5,000 fucking bits, dude.
[07:13.67]Seriously.
[07:16.81]I was here like three hours ago just checking in.
[07:21.25]I'm not even gonna say this because the votes are over and I'm not gonna cause a fight in chat.
[07:26.30]Long story short, Nancy Drew was on that list and it had 6% of the whole vote and a lot of people were angry.
[07:33.12]How many times do I have to pick?
[07:44.29]Do I really care about this?
[07:56.44]yes I'm aware that that is a name of somebody that I've potentially made up in the chat okay I don't just I what the fuck do I care chat will never forget this is my no I'm changing it but what if I just be careful and what if like
[08:18.17]Who is David?
[08:18.97]I don't fucking know.
[08:19.97]I probably made that name when I was drunk.
[08:23.63]Or, this is a used Xbox 360 console.
[08:26.31]That could be like some other person's account or something.
[08:28.85]I don't know.
[08:29.37]I don't remember.
[08:29.97]I don't remember.
[08:31.64]I don't know.
[08:39.28]Stolen.
[08:40.32]No, it's not.
[08:41.16]I made it or something.
[08:42.20]I don't know.
[08:42.68]I can't.
[08:43.24]I have no idea.
[08:44.93]I cannot tell you the real reason why.
[08:46.33]It's just there.
[08:50.21]Alright, how do I?
[08:50.75]Hold on.
[08:52.43]What should I name this?
[08:56.65]This is a stolen Xbox.
[08:59.34]I didn't fucking steal this Xbox.
[09:02.20]I didn't steal it.
[09:04.62]I purchased it.
[09:06.20]God damn it.
[09:07.70]I purchased it.
[09:08.86]I purchased it.
[09:12.62]Prove it.
[09:13.60]You want me to show you the receipt from when I bought this Xbox 360?
[09:18.97]Guys, that receipt went into the trash.
[09:23.69]What do you want me to say?
[09:25.20]Do you think I held on to the Xbox 360 refurbished receipt?
[09:30.40]This thing was like $44.
[09:31.24]No, I think this thing was like $38.
[09:37.42]That's irresponsible.
[09:49.06]...for tax purposes.
[09:53.02]I don't know... I don't... What do you want me to... You want to write off the 360?
[09:56.28]Alright, fine.
[09:58.82]I'll go get the receipt and I'll write off the 360 for you, okay?
[10:03.85]It's... Look, I've got a CPA that takes care of this for me.
[10:09.83]Jeremy, did you itemize that fucking 360?
[10:13.27]No, I don't care.
[10:13.87]Want me to throw it in the trash?
[10:15.56]And I'll open the trash?
[10:16.60]I'm going to drop the fucking thing into the trash.
[10:19.74]No, I wouldn't do that.
[10:20.54]I would fucking donate it.
[10:21.68]Stop.
[10:22.40]Anyways, what's the name of the garden?
[10:24.64]What's the name of the garden?
[10:25.49]Anybody got a name for the garden?
[10:31.67]David's Garden?
[10:35.93]David's Garden.
[10:38.09]Well, I don't...
[10:48.38]I've missed you guys.
[10:50.00]It's been like five days.
[10:51.18]I've missed you guys.
[10:53.80]David's... Wait.
[10:55.78]Where's the little symbol that shows possession?
[11:10.38]Okay, there we go.
[11:14.96]Put it on the hard drive.
[11:16.24]Oh, finally, we can get past the fucking main menu.
[11:18.02]Great gardeners can make their piñatas candiosity meter full, and piñatas at full candiosity are much more valuable.
[11:25.49]So you say this one's much better than the last one.
[11:27.35]Why?
[11:30.67]Why is this one better than the last one?
[11:33.67]Extra, uh, extra sweet?
[11:42.06]It's the same fucking game.
[11:43.42]Oh.
[11:46.89]I just love fireworks.
[11:50.23]Oh, get away.
[11:51.31]This is my moment.
[11:53.25]What are you waiting for?
[12:02.76]Get inside and finish the job.
[12:05.88]It's been like five days since I said that.
[12:09.62]Now that we're inside Piñata Center, we can use simple hacking techniques to steal
[12:15.84]No such thing as a simple hacking technique.
[12:17.72]It's all incredibly detailed code and shit.
[12:19.44]I hate when people fucking say that, by the way.
[12:21.95]As a fucking coder myself.
[12:23.29]That's so fucking irritating.
[12:24.59]Until I am the piñata king of the world!
[12:30.35]Hurry up, you incompetent code monkey!
[12:33.03]I have piñata to capture!
[12:34.61]Delete all files.
[12:38.05]Press any key to confirm.
[12:40.77]What just happened?
[12:43.72]You did what?
[12:46.10]Is this a bit?
[12:48.62]Hold on, you can't tell if me saying that I'm a coder is real or not?
[12:54.45]There's absolutely no way that's accurate.
[12:56.33]Victory is mine!
[13:06.70]Um, no, I don't know anything about code.
[13:08.68]In fact, I tried a long time ago and it was a disaster.
[13:12.27]Seriously fucking impossible.
[13:14.35]It's like one of the most detailed, most difficult skills in the world.
[13:17.60]Okay.
[13:26.03]Let's open up the menu.
[13:27.33]This is the garden.
[13:27.96]Ooh, it's just like the last one.
[13:29.32]Here comes the same stream we did with different animals.
[13:35.00]We're gonna get introduced to all the weird bugs and foxes.
[13:46.53]It's a rerun.
[13:48.59]Hey, at least the garden is done.
[13:53.23]I don't have to do any bullshit.
[13:58.91]Oh, you can take pictures in this one?
[14:04.45]Wait, we already get a frog too?
[14:05.73]Holy shit.
[14:12.56]Wow, okay.
[14:14.86]What do you want me to do?
[14:15.78]Make a flower?
[14:21.81]What?
[14:24.70]Okay.
[14:55.12]So, this piano, this is a bit spotty.
[14:57.98]It likes to buff its shell to a shine and lacquer its spots, and those eyelashes just don't naturally curl like that, you know.
[15:04.44]Unfortunately, all this attention on appearance means it often forgets to turn off the iron before it sleeps in the morning!
[15:23.25]Okay, it must be of maximum candiosity.
[15:29.02]You know central will only send pinatas that are filled to the brim with candy to parties Okay, you can get your pinatas ready for their trip in a kennel can't Kenan otta by feeding them This is a lot.
[15:41.43]This is not the same game Nobody said feel-good ink laugh
[16:00.11]Find the many ways that you can increase a piñata's candiosity meter, and then send it off to a party.
[16:05.18]Alright, how do we fill the candio- what, you have to, like, dress it up in clogs?
[16:15.74]Alright, we need a flower.
[16:19.34]That's what it wants, right?
[16:23.48]Somebody make that?
[16:24.30]I'm sure somebody will, don't worry,berger.
[16:26.00]Give them, like, five minutes.
[16:29.63]It's like the bug with your cursor.
[16:34.58]Information button.
[16:35.36]Alright, we need a flower, right?
[16:37.42]Have three poppies in the garden.
[16:39.92]And that will bring Abyss Potty in.
[16:50.24]Okay.
[16:52.45]Move the cursor into the garden and open up the menu and put a flower.
[16:56.46]Alright, so where should I put these?
[16:58.02]I know people are gonna scream at me for- I'm gonna get screamed at for doing this wrong.
[17:01.38]Somebody already made it.
[17:03.85]Oh.
[17:04.17]How the fuck have you already done this?
[17:06.63]You need at least like five minutes to upload the video to YouTube.
[17:10.23]It's impossible.
[17:23.44]Are we doing Animal Crossing tonight?
[17:24.76]No, we are not!
[17:25.94]Because during the process of the move and packing and getting bought, Kim has been playing Animal Crossing each night.
[17:33.02]This is one thing that we can, like, do.
[17:36.15]So that is currently in the occupation of Kim.
[17:42.09]It cannot play Animal Crossing.
[17:43.31]It's been commandeered.
[17:46.87]Oh, we have lovely flowers.
[17:47.63]If you put, put the cursor on this body and press Y, you can find out what it needs.
[17:50.59]We need three of them, right?
[17:53.07]Oh, he's here.
[17:53.43]Okay, cool.
[17:56.06]So it wants three of these.
[17:59.44]Cool.
[18:02.86]Oops.
[18:03.60]What did I just do?
[18:06.98]Wait, can I plant this?
[18:11.85]Wait, there are already three in here, aren't there?
[18:13.15]There's one, two... Only two.
[18:15.99]Do I have to buy this shit, or can I plant this?
[18:20.42]Kim stream, Kim stream.
[18:22.95]She's not here.
[18:23.71]This dude is a simp.
[18:27.41]What?
[18:29.43]Hold on.
[18:30.03]Let me get this straight.
[18:32.47]So because my girlfriend is currently occupying the Nintendo Switch during the potential downtime of a move, that makes me a simp.
[18:48.02]Is that what we're understanding here?
[18:53.28]I don't know what that word really means.
[19:02.68]Simp meme is already dead, give it a rest.
[19:05.45]Alright, yeah, give it a rest.
[19:06.43]That's a dead meme, according to that one guy.
[19:08.25]That's a one guy moment.
[19:09.25]Alright, so how do- let's- Wait, what?
[19:12.67]Oh fuck, there's another one.
[19:15.79]I remember these guys!
[19:25.58]Well done.
[19:27.80]Good soil.
[19:28.84]Oh shit, here they come again.
[19:31.94]This is part two.
[19:34.48]Snakes and worms and bugs!
[19:39.30]Okay, some grass.
[19:46.78]Alright, what do you need?
[19:50.15]You need...
[19:52.81]Three poppies in the garden.
[19:54.49]Alright, and I gotta buy a poppy.
[19:59.95]Trouble.
[20:01.79]So we just dig a hole?
[20:02.89]Does it matter where?
[20:03.93]Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[20:05.31]Get away from there!
[20:06.05]Get away from that!
[20:08.06]Don't eat that!
[20:08.56]Uh, I'll just... Can I put them... How close can they be?
[20:19.08]Just do it wherever?
[20:20.16]Let's just do it right here.
[20:25.06]Okay.
[20:26.02]And we're gonna put a poppy, right?
[20:28.26]Oh, that's a poppy right there!
[20:33.71]Don't ignore the story.
[20:34.69]There is no story.
[20:36.81]It's invite a bunch of fucking stuffed animals over your house for a few hours.
[20:39.91]That's the game.
[20:40.45]Okay, menu.
[20:45.91]Now I can get the watering can.
[20:47.61]Yep.
[20:52.59]You're missing the lore.
[20:57.15]You make up your own lore when it comes to stuffed animals.
[20:59.93]Guys, I used to sit in my bedroom with a dozen stuffed animals and make up TV shows with them.
[21:05.09]That was my lore with them.
[21:06.59]I can do whatever.
[21:07.01]I can say whatever I want with these guys.
[21:08.23]Alright, that's good.
[21:14.81]So now it's going to grow and that guy will stay.
[21:16.71]So I have good grass, right?
[21:17.69]What does this say?
[21:18.17]What do you need?
[21:20.37]How do I get you to be a resident?
[21:23.23]Let's see.
[21:24.27]Okay, you have two square pinometers of grass.
[21:27.43]Has eaten a mouse mallow.
[21:28.95]Alright, I need a mouse mallow.
[21:29.92]If he wasn't a kid, that was last week.
[21:35.82]I mean, that's kind of accurate, if you think about it.
[21:37.58]Alright, get that poppy to grow.
[21:40.90]Are you a resident here?
[21:44.04]Romance has eaten one green flutterscotch.
[21:46.59]Okay.
[21:51.20]Wait for the bug to reside.
[21:53.98]But how long does the flower take?
[21:55.18]These things remind me of a toad.
[22:00.90]Yeah, this is a fucking toad.
[22:05.63]I don't want these things.
[22:11.59]Let him out.
[22:12.05]Well, I don't... No, I'm not letting the frog out.
[22:16.67]This is my only friend.
[22:20.05]I only have one friend, and it's this code.
[22:23.48]Max Candiosity Hint.
[22:26.32]Okay.

[48:32.75]It's perfect.
[48:34.49]No, I want the shovel.
[48:35.25]Ooh, only eight more levels.
[48:38.49]That's kind of a long way to go.
[48:40.72]Alright.
[48:41.88]Let's plant this lake right here.
[48:57.27]Get out of my way.
[48:57.93]Before you make me angry.
[49:08.38]What plan is this?
[49:14.14]Attack him.
[49:14.76]I'm not gonna attack him!
[49:15.84]Oh, a Sparrow-ment.
[49:23.62]So how many, uh, how many Pokemons are in this game?
[49:26.86]How many, like, actually exist in the game?
[49:34.02]Oh, they can hear the worms.
[49:36.74]Alright, I gotta start to do some builds here.
[49:43.53]Kill him.
[49:44.83]I'm not gonna... You can't kill anybody.
[49:49.85]Ooh, there's another one.
[49:50.43]Let's plant this right next to each other.
[49:51.79]This is a daisy.
[49:52.51]Somebody has to eat a daisy, don't they?
[49:57.03]You can't kill anybody, guys.
[49:59.33]Why does everything have to be about the... Kill him!
[50:01.55]Kill him!
[50:02.07]Kill!
[50:16.46]You're killing the animals.
[50:17.62]I'm not killing the animals!
[50:22.08]Oh!
[50:25.48]What did that... What's that for?
[50:28.36]I'm not killing any animals.
[50:29.38]No, that's a lie.
[50:30.04]I don't believe the people in here saying that.
[50:32.13]That's a lie.
[50:32.69]They're lying to you.
[50:35.89]Be on the lookout for people with false information right now on this channel.
[50:40.37]They're lying to you.
[50:41.07]Oh!
[50:43.23]I didn't know it was going to be overwatered that far.
[50:47.54]That's that far?
[50:48.20]I thought it was a little more.
[50:49.08]Can you suck that up?
[50:51.60]Can you just, like, suck it up or something?
[50:53.36]Alright, wait.
[50:54.58]There's another one of these.
[50:55.22]Give me this thing.
[51:00.08]I don't like this pavement here.
[51:01.28]Why would you pave a huge square around one flower?
[51:04.50]Are you stupid?
[51:06.14]Terrible design.
[51:08.85]Awful craftsmanship.
[51:17.33]And a lot of new animals.
[51:23.01]Oh, I thought that was his tail for a second.
[51:27.79]Scent of flowers?
[51:28.63]Okay.
[51:29.91]A Tapley.
[51:31.47]No, I don't want... These things... These things remind me of Otto.
[51:36.58]But I don't want a Tap... Remember we had too many Tapleys before and everyone freaked out and told me... Put Tapley in fire!
[51:43.02]Put Tapley in fire becomes Fire Tapley.
[51:46.09]That was a lot of... I don't want to do that anymore.
[51:52.92]Alright, I'm gonna... I want to get rid of this shit.
[51:56.65]How do I, like, delete an area?
[52:00.57]Shovel?
[52:01.53]Like, I have to get rid of this.
[52:04.39]This is so dumb.
[52:17.32]Sell it?
[52:17.68]What do you mean, sell it?
[52:21.00]How do I sell it?
[52:34.62]No, I wanna take a picture.
[52:35.52]Come on!
[52:35.82]Yes!
[53:08.83]Okay, what was I doing?
[53:09.61]Yeah, how do I sell this?
[53:11.57]Can I do that?
[53:12.45]I don't think I can sell this stuff, guys.
[53:17.92]Unless I can't select it or anything.
[53:19.24]I have to just delete.
[53:22.24]Can I just go to the store?
[53:25.06]Go to the store?
[53:30.71]There is no store.
[53:35.73]This is the post office.
[53:39.72]I have to unlock the shop, okay.
[53:42.32]No, just please don't, don't slap that, the mouth up and down really quick and make a laughing noise.
[53:50.96]Oh, this, this doesn't, this tutorial doesn't matter?
[53:56.13]Okay.
[53:58.05]Somebody said, please do a chocolate factory stream.
[54:02.51]What would I even, how would I, what would I even do?
[54:10.05]Like, you want me to do, like, a travel channel... This is the chocolate factory.
[54:16.09]Show me how it all works.
[54:25.34]Yes.
[54:29.18]So, you guys unanimously want a...
[54:35.88]Chocolate Factory Tour.
[54:37.90]There's no jokes here.
[54:39.66]It's just, hey, this is the Chocolate Factory.
[54:43.54]This is what you want.
[54:49.03]There's not going to be any clowns going to run by.
[54:51.67]That's what it is.
[54:52.77]Okay.
[54:55.29]Not a joke.
[54:55.79]Okay.
[54:56.73]I'll see what I can do.
[54:58.69]I'll see what I can do.
[55:00.87]I'll see what I can do.
[55:14.57]He acts like he doesn't want a factory tour.
[55:17.03]I mean, I do.
[55:19.27]That's kind of cool.
[55:21.30]I do want that.
[55:30.68]Okay, I'm going to try this.
[55:32.03]Alright.
[55:33.39]Alright.
[55:34.13]Let's see what I can do.
[55:43.41]He's going to tour a chocolate factory.
[55:47.45]Yeah, I don't think it's gonna work.
[55:49.09]It's gonna be... It's gonna be freaking loud.
[55:56.51]You're not gonna hear anything.
[55:59.69]It's gonna be like... So what do you think?
[56:04.61]It's gonna be like a vacuum cleaner in the background constantly.
[56:15.15]I'm gonna have to get like a shitty lapel mic that's gonna be like... I think that- yeah, that looks like the chocolate coming off the rack there.
[56:28.26]It's gonna be the worst dream you've- alright, fine.
[56:39.27]Cut his lapel mic.
[56:40.49]Fine.
[56:43.31]Okay.
[56:46.70]I still need to make a hole here.
[56:50.68]Do the jelly bean factory?
[56:51.98]Am I gonna start doing, like, candy factory tours?
[57:02.39]How do I explain this to one of these factories, by the way?
[57:06.13]make a phone call make a few phone calls talk to him just so I'm just wanting to get in touch with you with your uh like your pr your marketing or your uh you know your tour department for being you know on like on camera and do it for like a broadcast what am I supposed to say oh cool what what what industry do you work in well um I'm I'm I'm like I'm an e-clown
[57:27.79]Oh, so why do you want to do this?
[57:29.04]Is this like a new food channel?
[57:31.06]No, no, no.
[57:31.76]I just, one person in my community said that it would be a fun idea to do a chocolate factory tour.
[57:38.36]So that's why I'm here.
[57:39.28]One person told me to do this.
[57:42.28]Oh, so there's literally, you don't have any reason to be here besides this one person told you to do this.
[57:46.94]Yeah, that's it.
[57:48.32]That's pretty much all that's going to happen.
[57:54.32]I'm not, like, a food blogger.
[57:55.76]Should I make a food blog in the meantime?
[57:59.30]Just to, like, have a website?
[58:00.40]And just, like, have it for, like, the next couple weeks, write about, like, fucking foods I eat.
[58:11.38]And then just send them there and say, hey, I'm an e-clown, but I also do have a food blog I just started.
[58:16.54]I'm really trying.
[58:17.24]This is, like, this is, like, when...
[58:26.43]Don't eat that, you don't know where it's been.
[58:37.83]Okay, first of all.
[58:44.81]Okay, fine.
[58:46.75]I'll do like fucking- I'm gonna do my own like fucking restaurant guide streams.
[59:00.56]Like chocolate factories and restaurants.
[59:05.02]This one's called Take a Bite with Jerma.
[59:07.73]Take a... More than... Ah!
[59:09.95]More than you can chew.
[59:11.31]Starring Jerma985.
[59:13.21]Got it.
[59:14.21]Got it.
[59:14.73]Printed.
[59:17.73]Done.
[59:22.84]WELCOME BACK TO MORE THAN YOU CAN CHEW AT Jerma985!
[59:24.73]I'M HERE AT THIS JOINT!
[59:25.65]Well, that's literally just ripping off completely.
[59:29.63]Um, Guy Fieri.
[59:33.21]I can't do that.
[59:33.77]I can't do that.
[59:34.29]I can't talk like that.
[59:35.17]Alright, I need to play this game.
[59:36.99]First of all.
[59:44.34]Why?
[59:45.12]Why?
[59:45.88]Why?
[59:46.86]You put an idea in my head and now it's like the only thing I care about.
[59:52.66]Alright, I'm gonna make this happen.
[59:54.16]No jokes.
[59:56.84]I had so many other things planned.
[59:59.98]This is stepping over all of them.
[60:06.48]Alright, you guys need a house.
[60:08.64]You even need a daisy?
[60:09.82]What the fuck?
[60:12.04]Go eat a daisy.
[60:12.70]You, eat a daisy.
[60:13.84]Please.
[60:14.10]They're over here.
[60:16.26]Eat it.
[60:19.03]Eat daisy.
[60:22.03]Go do it tonight.
[60:24.35]I... I'm sorry, I can't... I can't take a tour of a chocolate factory right now.
[60:29.95]You guys... It's not... It's not possible.
[60:37.90]You need to eat two of these?
[60:38.72]One more?
[60:42.80]Has eaten one daisy.
[60:44.17]What?
[60:44.75]You just ate it.
[60:45.31]That's not a daisy?
[60:46.43]Wait a minute.
[60:48.05]Did you just not eat a daisy?
[60:51.61]There's a daisy.
[60:54.59]He just crushed it.
[61:08.92]What are you doing?
[61:09.50]Remember, you should get bangs before showing us the chart.
[61:16.38]Why would I get bangs?
[61:20.68]Why do you want me to have bangs?
[61:21.68]Are you going to eat this or what?
[61:28.88]There you go.
[61:29.32]Alright, you're going to eat one more of those.
[61:36.53]There we go.
[61:37.35]Alright, now we can do it.
[61:39.17]Now we need a bespotty house in the garden.
[61:42.37]How do we do that?
[61:49.37]Uh, nay, thank you, nay means nay for the 11 community subs.
[61:55.81]Thanks for the fucking 11 sub drop.
[62:04.23]I don't want, why do you want me to keep doing this?
[62:05.91]There's something deeply wrong with your audience.
[62:12.00]What?
[62:23.05]Okay, I'm sorry.
[62:25.07]Alright guys, stop being so weird.
[62:28.40]You're scaring people off.
[62:30.20]Stop being so weird.
[62:35.94]No, no, yes.
[62:40.25]I am the ruler of the kingdom, and the ruler of the kingdom says to relax.
[62:42.97]I have a new visitor?
[62:51.91]Never.
[62:52.29]No.
[62:52.95]Fuck the king.
[62:55.41]Uh-oh.
[62:58.13]What have I done?
[63:00.95]We are influenced by you, weirdo.
[63:06.63]No, don't.
[63:07.54]Don't do that.
[63:08.82]Captain Crunchy, thanks for the five community subs.
[63:10.78]Jerma sucks, thanks for the five community subs.
[63:12.66]Thanks, both of you.
[63:14.51]Now open.
[63:15.68]Return to the game, press A, and then press X to open the menu.
[63:20.68]Cool.
[63:22.10]Cool, thanks.
[63:25.06]Finally, we can build a house.
[63:26.69]We need to build a house for the biscottis.
[63:30.77]A biscotti house.
[63:32.27]Master builder, if you have pinatas that need somewhere to call... How much does it cost?
[63:37.19]Zero, good.
[63:38.12]As soon as you've decided where to place the building...
[63:45.87]Now what if?
[63:47.27]No.
[63:56.27]God damn it.
[63:57.42]Don't fucking do this.
[63:59.68]No, I can't right now.
[64:02.34]I can't do that right now.
[64:04.38]It's not possible.
[64:06.80]I can't do it.
[64:07.57]It's not possible.
[64:09.59]I can't.
[64:13.64]I actually can't.
[64:15.00]I was gonna say, instead of going to a real chocolate factory, just do a huge fucking bit where they make a fake chocolate factory and go through a tour with like six different people and they're all characters and like I'm in a costume and shit.
[64:38.39]It's just Willy Wonka, but it's not.
[64:42.33]Ugh.
[64:45.05]That's a lot of, that's a lot of money.
[64:47.59]And, I can't, right, this is like, all the, that's not possible right now.
[64:51.55]Maybe, maybe in the future.
[64:53.16]Alright, I gotta put this down.
[64:54.48]I'm not a millionaire.
[65:01.58]I don't know where people get this idea.
[65:04.88]I don't have, I don't have millions of dollars.
[65:16.94]This is expensive.
[65:19.32]Making a fake chocolate factory.
[65:22.24]That's extreme.
[65:34.82]You own two houses.
[65:36.48]I don't own two houses.
[65:43.64]What are you talking about?
[65:46.62]He owns three!
[65:48.85]That was very... I'm kidding.
[65:52.01]No, but for real, that's... I'll have to figure out how I want to do that.
[65:55.07]That'd be really fun.
[66:02.02]He owns a Boston vacation house.
[66:04.18]I don't own that!
[66:06.90]Stop!
[66:13.50]Tore a sewage plant and pretend it's a chocolate factory.
[66:18.64]Holy shit!
[66:29.54]And the whole time I'm asking questions about like, so what do you wrap it and everything?
[66:34.44]And they keep correcting me.
[66:36.42]This is not a chocolate factory.
[66:38.22]What's wrong with you?
[66:40.05]So I see up there, is that where the vanilla paste is added?
[66:45.07]This is shit up there!
[66:47.37]What's wrong with you?
[66:50.44]The whole time I'm just so fucked up and so oblivious.
[66:53.62]I think that's where I am.
[66:54.74]This is pretty... Ooh, they have a nice little driveway.
[67:12.37]Just ask for money from your 985 relatives.
[67:15.13]I can't, okay, this is fucked up and wicked fucking disgusting, but I can't even say it.
[67:33.89]Okay, so... Oh, come on!
[67:37.41]Ugh!
[67:41.92]You know where it's gonna- I'm not gonna- I can't.
[67:44.38]I can't even talk about this.
[67:45.50]We gotta move on.
[67:46.80]I can't talk about that.
[67:47.70]It's too fucked up.
[67:48.82]It's too fucked up.
[67:57.71]It's too fucked up.
[67:59.83]I can't.
[68:00.33]I can't.
[68:00.53]There's too many people here.
[68:01.33]There's 5,000 fucking people.
[68:03.23]I can't be on- I can't record myself saying this in front of 5,000 people.
[68:06.70]My mother would be so ashamed of me.
[68:16.12]Alright, let's open it.
[68:19.19]Ta-da!
[68:23.15]Make Bugleberry say it.
[68:24.23]It's not even you.
[68:25.53]Oh, that's not... That's not how this works.
[68:31.43]I can't... I can't, like, plead insanity to my mother.
[68:34.31]Oh, it's okay.
[68:36.63]No, it's... Oh, it's okay.
[68:42.83]My mother's going to be very upset with me.
[68:46.22]I can't do that to my mother.
[68:50.20]Here, I'll say it.
[68:51.02]Just type it to me.
[68:55.79]I'll say it.
[68:58.03]No, no, no.
[68:59.37]Okay.
[69:00.23]I was just... I was gonna say... Let's just... Okay, let's make these two... Let's just... Let's just... These two bugs have sex with each other and maybe we'll... Oh, don't hit him.
[69:10.75]Come here.
[69:14.19]You guys ready?
[69:15.07]Oh, no, no, no.
[69:15.51]Wrong.
[69:15.89]It's these two.
[69:22.02]And... Here we go.
[69:24.12]We're gonna have some bespotty children.
[69:25.80]Always go- Okay.
[69:37.77]Welcome to the romancing mini game.
[69:39.97]Like there's snow.
[69:40.75]You need to take control of your piñata and try to reach your partner without hitting any loathers.
[69:46.71]The loathers are creatures created by Professor Pester.
[69:49.91]It's so fucking messed up.
[69:52.06]I can't say it.
[69:54.52]But it's kind of funny.
[69:57.08]If you hit a loather, you will lose a chance and waste some of your time.
[70:01.18]If you lose all of your time... Alright, so like the sewer water is coming down, right?
[70:05.02]Just like...
[70:08.61]through like a pipe it's like and I'm like oh wow cool man it's like a fountain can I try it I just like dip my head underneath it and like
[70:30.31]And it's like, you know when like a huge amount of water in a very concentrated beam like it hits a part of your body and it just like it fucking goes everywhere.
[70:43.69]Imagine that like directly in the forehead.
[70:54.88]There you go.
[70:55.34]That's what I was thinking.
[70:56.24]I didn't say anything.
[70:57.40]That's what I was thinking.
[70:58.76]And it's like ridiculous, okay?
[71:02.66]I said the sewer, I said the water.
[71:04.62]I said the sewer water coming down.
[71:06.09]I didn't say anything else.
[71:08.91]Okay, this is game over?
[71:10.11]How did I get a game over?
[71:13.35]Your mom, my mom, no, mom.
[71:18.10]I know you, mom, I know you're watching.
[71:19.50]Just remember.
[71:22.99]I almost ate a shoe on camera.
[71:24.85]Okay?
[71:25.69]Like, just... And I know we talked about that, and it was like, don't do that.
[71:29.63]Honey, please.
[71:30.17]And I was like, Mom, I'm not going to eat a shoe on camera.
[71:32.69]I'm not going to.
[71:34.35]Unless... Unless in a few days, maybe, I get like a hundred million... Ten million channel points will come in, and maybe I'll do it.
[71:44.21]Oh, the romancing minigame.
[71:45.20]Right, okay, let's go.
[71:47.53]As the old saying goes you can't hurry love and that's especially true on piñata island these days You'll notice that the object of your affections will be none too pleased if you make your approach before proving your feelings To do this you need to collect the required number of love hearts.
[72:05.54]You'll do anything for money.
[72:07.18]Oh stop I won't do anything for money
[72:12.40]But I do like that word!
[72:14.30]I do like that word, money.
[72:15.66]No, I won't.
[72:19.01]Okay, to do this, you need to collect the number of hearts, and to give it a meter.
[72:24.99]Okay, let's go.
[72:27.05]Okay.
[72:27.61]Alright, you're blocking the way.
[72:36.82]This is tricky.
[72:38.50]This actually is tricky.
[72:40.40]This actually, this actually, this actually is.
[72:41.76]This actually.
[72:42.76]This actually is.
[72:45.76]No, this is actually tricky.
[72:48.30]Oh, fuck it, there's a time limit.
[72:51.32]Holy fuck, I was lost.
[72:55.98]Actually, this is actually.

[84:46.66]I guess to be up to be Frank with you to be up front with you um a lot of services and a lot of stuff has slowed down a lot since all the coronavirus stuff so that's why it's taking a little bit more time to kind of get it all done so that's why I didn't really get everything done that we wanted to but that's just you know that's the way it is right now you know we have to do what we can right
[85:14.90]So over the next week or so, we'll be doing these reduced streams for us to kind of get everything we need to get done, get done.
[85:26.02]He's never going to play Hulk.

[98:25.03]Alright, I'm gonna try... What's happening to my money?
[98:29.59]Alright, I'm gonna go try to get a geckie.
[98:36.48]I'm basing my entire home around a geckie.
[98:51.30]I could bring another one to you too.
[98:52.50]Alright, here.
[98:53.80]We're going to do this.
[98:54.36]I'm going to put some bait here.
[98:57.52]So I can have two of these.
[98:58.26]So we can do some breeding of the... Whatever they are.
[99:03.58]Ooh.
[99:04.14]Okay.
[99:05.38]Crap.
[99:06.26]Home edition.
[99:08.96]Why is this a Windows version?
[99:10.22]What?
[99:12.72]That's got a lucky feel.
[99:18.78]Alright, put it right here.
[99:19.48]Fade it up!
[99:26.97]Play Ultimate Spider-Man.
[99:29.81]No, I already played the best Spider-Man.
[99:31.25]Spider-Man 2, no.
[99:50.58]Here we go.
[99:54.20]How do I get a Geki to come out again?
[99:55.57]Alright, trap.
[100:04.21]Play two-hill.
[100:08.81]How do you pronounce that?
[100:13.37]How do you pronounce that?
[100:22.05]Too-hoo.
[100:23.59]It's too-hoo.
[100:30.91]No, that's not correct.
[100:32.25]It's not too-hoo.
[100:35.11]Yoo-hoo.
[100:36.74]Do people still drink Yoo-hoo?
[100:39.76]You know what?
[100:40.30]I have not seen Yoo-hoo on the shelf in probably five to ten years.
[100:44.02]Because that was a chocolate... I used to drink it all the time.
[100:48.36]Let me tell you.
[100:49.67]Listen to me.
[100:51.64]Yoo-hoo out of the can.
[100:54.76]In the fridge, right?
[100:56.24]Get it in the fridge, in those cans.
[100:59.26]Was awesome.
[101:00.96]It was so good.
[101:02.70]I used to love drinking Yoo-hoo out of the can.
[101:05.42]Freezing cold.
[101:07.98]Um, it's a chocolate drink.
[101:09.44]It's not chocolate milk.
[101:10.68]It's just chocolate-flavored water.
[101:13.66]It tastes like metal.
[101:15.79]No, you just said that.
[101:16.59]I didn't.
[101:19.03]It doesn't taste like metal?
[101:22.22]Alright, alright, everybody, everybody relax, we found one.
[101:24.58]Okay, a geckie finds it hard versus a delicate snowdrop flower.
[101:30.00]It does not taste like fucking metal, it tastes like chocolate.
[101:37.77]It just tastes like... It just tastes like kind of gross, but I like it.
[101:41.97]Here we go!
[101:50.63]Yes!
[101:51.63]Come get it.
[101:52.67]I need two of you.
[101:55.25]Drink one on stream and be disappointed.
[101:56.97]I used to drink ten of these a day.
[101:59.37]I used to drink ten of these a day.
[102:03.50]That's a lie.
[102:04.00]Maybe like four.
[102:06.34]A Volturo?
[102:16.48]I don't... That's like a fucking cereal mascot.
[102:18.78]I don't want that thing.
[102:21.12]Oh, I need to put it on a trap.
[102:25.43]Okay.
[102:31.21]That's like the off-brand Cocoa Puffs bird.
[102:35.34]That's the shit that's in the bag on the bottom row.
[102:37.34]Which, by the way, just buy that.
[102:39.60]It's like the same shit, but it's like $4 less expensive.
[102:44.22]That's kind of lucky.
[102:49.09]Cut his mic!
[102:49.89]Alright, put it down here.
[102:55.59]And then put this here.
[102:58.31]Alright, get it!
[103:11.16]That's quite a stride.
[103:15.73]Holy shit.
[103:18.63]This motherfucker means business.
[103:22.47]This motherfucker means business.
[103:24.94]I like him, though.
[103:26.10]What do you need?
[103:28.08]Eat something... A Volturo likes to eat something to make it sweat.
[103:32.78]Hot, hot food?
[103:33.66]Hot pepper?
[103:34.12]Here we go!
[103:46.82]I'm gonna get a... I'm gonna get a geckie!
[103:50.32]Yeah!
[103:55.24]Amphibians and reptiles only.
[103:58.11]And a couple of, uh, Chad birds.
[104:08.08]There it is again.
[104:08.60]I'm gonna link it.
[104:10.52]No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[104:11.94]Fuck that.
[104:12.26]Who cares?
[104:20.33]Alright, let's go back and open up the boxes.

[107:47.05]I'm fucking normal.
[107:52.40]I'm just like you.
[107:58.11]What do you want to be resident?

[108:37.73]Alright, question.
[108:39.47]Question for you.
[108:40.03]Uh, because streams have to be reduced in time over the next, like, week.

[109:10.01]We've got to wait till, like, some of the social distancing stuff is... Yeah, I, I'm not, yeah, I bet they're probably not even doing tours.
[109:16.49]Wherever, wherever I would go.
[109:18.25]I can't just do that tomorrow.
[109:29.73]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[109:59.73]of cooking.
[110:03.58]Cooking.
[110:06.56]Not what you think, though.
[110:10.16]I have purchased.
[110:11.26]I'm going to be doing cooking the way that I know how to cook.
[110:16.17]And that is with an easy bake oven.
[110:19.17]And various other cooking devices.
[110:25.67]Get the fuck out of the way.
[110:33.24]Gonna make, uh, some of the things in the packet.
[110:39.27]Bugleberry cooking.
[110:40.31]If you know there's a Bugleberry cooking stream, you know there'll be at least a few.
[110:44.56]Oh!
[110:45.04]Oh!
[110:46.10]At least, like, one or two of them.
[110:48.65]That's guaranteed.
[110:59.10]So I need a... Here we go.
[111:00.52]I need a flutter scotch population.
[111:03.70]So then the geckos can live here.
[111:05.96]If it's bugle... It's not going to be Bugleberry.
[111:10.46]Okay, let's get those daisies up so we can get some more flutter scotches.
[111:24.12]Look, they're friends.

[111:57.83]He's just rucking everything.
[112:05.42]You stink if you have an idea.
[112:13.54]How do I keep you around?
[112:16.43]Eat a turnip.
[112:17.17]Isn't there a turnip over here?
[112:21.43]Where is it?
[112:21.69]It's right here.
[112:22.05]Is it not ready?
[112:24.59]Hey, look.

[112:51.61]Okay, he didn't.
[112:54.51]Here we go.
[112:55.12]Eating a turnip.
[112:55.74]Now he's a resident.
[112:56.48]Good.
[113:01.06]Do you live here now?
[113:10.29]What's your color scheme?
[113:16.79]Pink and white?
[113:17.71]Okay.
[113:18.69]Okay, now... We need these daisies to grow.
[113:23.41]How do I make his candy bar status go all the way up?
[113:33.75]He needs to eat flutters.
[113:34.63]We need more flutter scotches.
[113:40.81]Alright, you two ready?
[113:41.47]Alright, they both need to eat a turnip.
[113:47.06]Do they?
[113:48.08]Yes, they do.
[113:48.52]I need more turnips.
[113:50.22]Let's make another.
[113:50.88]Okay, we're going to put turnips.
[113:51.98]There's daisies.
[113:52.50]We're going to do turnips this way.
[113:56.28]I'm getting so fucking pumped up.
[113:59.20]Not actually, though.
[114:00.85]You lost 100 people since the Bugleberry impression.
[114:05.35]Whatever.
[114:08.77]Okay.
[114:11.46]Take that away.
[114:18.10]Seed bag.
[114:22.79]He doesn't give a shit.
[114:24.29]Turn it up.
[114:43.07]water can I could I upgrade the can oh no is there even a reason to upgrade the watering can yet probably not how quickly could I lose every single viewer it wouldn't take very much time
[115:00.28]I would just play white noise as loud as I can possibly go and turn it up all the way to, like, plus 5,000 dB.
[115:05.15]You would just, everyone would leave.
[115:06.27]You have to.
[115:10.81]Like, the people wouldn't stay for that.
[115:12.03]And not just people, like, pretend like they would.
[115:13.44]Alright, here we go.
[115:22.83]Do an experiment?
[115:23.63]No, I'm not, I'm, I'm playing, uh, I'm playing Viva Piñata.
[115:27.77]I want to, like, just chill.
[115:28.69]I don't want to blast white noise for 25 straight minutes.
[115:33.45]I'm not doing that right now.
[115:42.96]Or, I know, I mean, I know a way that it would, I could, I would probably lose two or three thousand.
[115:49.82]concurrent people that are here right now if I like switch to like like singing stream and like I was actually trying like really really hard and I wasn't I was really off key and and I was looking right in the camera if I was looking directly in the camera and singing I think at least three or four probably three thousand people would leave instantly so
[116:13.44]And no, no, not like jokey like that.
[116:15.12]I got a feeling.
[116:16.47]No, not like that.
[116:17.19]I'm talking like I'm looking in the camera and singing like at everybody here.
[116:21.59]I think it wouldn't take very long because I can't.
[116:23.95]I'm not like that great at singing.
[116:26.09]And if I was like taking it dead serious, I feel like people would be like, I got to fucking get out of here, man.
[116:40.98]Do like really deep songs too.
[116:45.39]Not like rock and roll or like upbeat or pop.
[116:49.09]Like really deep emotional song.
[116:52.17]I feel like people would be like, I'm not really into this.
[117:02.50]You think you would stay?
[117:03.98]You would not.
[117:05.22]Alright.
[117:05.46]We got turnips.
[117:06.04]We got daisies.
[117:06.78]I need to wear those.
[117:07.74]Ooh.
[117:08.46]Ooh.

[118:03.90]That was a pretty cool town I had.
[118:10.99]I don't think you understand, guys.
[118:11.91]It would be like... You don't understand.
[118:17.06]I would go all in on it.
[118:18.98]And it'd be like...
[118:22.80]It would be like that for like 30 minutes.
[118:24.86]With like instrumental behind me.
[118:27.62]Of the songs with like a karaoke in front of me.
[118:29.76]It would just fucking bleed.

[124:07.39]No, I don't want to do that.
[124:08.49]I'm not doing it.
[124:09.03]It's embarrassing and weird.
[124:10.35]I'm not doing it.
[124:13.43]I need a Flutterscotch domain.
[124:19.83]That's fine.
[124:20.15]I'm a coward.
[124:20.51]That's fine.
[124:23.17]I am a coward.
[124:23.81]Sure.
[124:25.69]Ooh, the egg.
[124:31.12]I thought you never got embarrassed.
[124:32.82]Well, it's not about getting embarrassed.
[124:34.20]It's about... What happens when somebody raids this channel, guys?
[124:40.94]Every time.
[124:46.26]And I mean every time.
[124:47.10]No matter what.
[124:48.97]What's a clip that you see in the chat that's spammed?
[124:52.73]A hundred times.
[124:55.09]Right.
[124:55.45]Okay.
[124:55.87]Good.
[124:56.55]So, do you want me to add more ammo?
[125:00.01]You know what I mean?
[125:01.22]Like, just have that.
[125:02.10]Oh, here.
[125:02.86]Hey, welcome to this channel, guys.
[125:05.64]Here's me singing happy birthday directly into the camera to you.
[125:10.38]This...
[125:18.50]Oh, you... What the fuck am I playing?
[125:21.53]This is Viva Piñata!
[125:24.61]I mean, what the fuck am I playing?
[125:27.89]We're talking like... Happy... No!
[125:32.47]I can't!
[125:34.33]I can't do it!
[125:36.88]It hurts!
[125:37.72]It takes every inch of my body to say that.
[125:43.02]Like...
[125:47.59]Happy.
[125:48.30]Oh, I can't.
[125:49.02]I can't do it.
[125:49.54]I'm not doing it.
[125:50.65]I refuse.
[125:52.59]I can't even do the first two lines.
[125:56.55]QRS is different because I was fucking drinking wine all night.
[126:04.51]That's different.
[126:06.87]And that was like a weird song and it was like a routine going on in there.
[126:11.67]It wasn't just me singing happy birthday to you directly looking at the camera and trying as hard as I can to sound like good and sound like fucking good.
[126:21.64]It's not the same thing.
[126:22.28]No, it's not.
[126:24.24]It's not even close.
[126:25.36]Oh!
[126:25.66]QRS is worse and it's not.
[126:33.10]Ooh, I can do water now.
[126:49.93]Wow, that's a fucking shovel upgrade.
[126:51.59]That's amazing.
[126:52.15]Now sing.
[126:52.61]No, there's no way.
[127:01.62]You won't get that from me.
[127:02.74]I'm sorry.
[127:15.14]Shovel.
[127:16.10]I thought he just was holding the frog's head.
[127:17.88]I was like, wait, what?

[127:57.45]This is the only cartridge we have.
[127:59.15]Are you kidding me?
[128:01.99]You just killed him.
[128:03.00]How do we get him back?

[128:37.57]You have to commit to the bit.
[128:39.35]No.
[128:43.17]Okay.
[128:44.33]Oh, he's a resident now.

[129:50.36]It's over.

[137:30.73]Is this a shitty version of Animal Crossing?
[137:33.69]I'm playing this because I don't have access to Animal Crossing.
[137:36.48]And by the way, this came out before Animal Crossing.
[137:38.36]Is that a lie?
[137:38.96]No, I don't think so.

[165:37.21]Yeah, I'll take one.
[165:38.87]Why not?
[165:39.17]I mean, they're cool.
[165:44.75]Even at night, they're a piñata.
[165:46.41]I'd recommend that.

[165:51.92]Wait, he'll eat all the friends?
[165:53.18]Will he?

[166:55.38]Wait, that's a snake.
[167:05.05]Oh, shit.
[167:05.99]Why did he eat the snowdrop?
[167:07.99]No, I don't want him to eat it.
[167:09.03]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[167:10.17]A kitty floss.
[167:11.11]I think this is one of the last things I saw.
[167:24.77]I love prowling at night and stalking at night.
[167:27.75]I know something else that does that.
[167:34.36]You still won't come over here with bread?
[167:37.26]Why are you such a dope?
[167:43.54]Well, there goes the mouse.
[167:45.04]At least I have a snake friend.

[174:59.63]What did I... What did I say?
[175:04.35]I don't even want to get it.
[175:13.39]That was so much fun.
[175:17.85]It really was.
[175:18.57]Just collecting hats.
[175:19.73]Is he angry?
[175:22.13]He's mad.
[175:26.01]Why is he so mad?
[175:27.05]What's his problem?
[175:45.65]He hates this thing.
[175:48.01]You don't like it?
[175:48.65]Fine.
[175:52.61]I'll get rid of it.
[175:53.60]You happy now?
[175:55.16]Oh, it's a pumpkin.
[176:06.15]That's kind of cool.

[176:23.36]Uh... What the fuck?
[176:27.72]Oh, shit.
[176:28.34]Is this okay?
[176:28.92]Cool.
[176:29.04]Can I get a pumpkin seed out of this?
[176:41.92]I've not been using... No, I haven't been using fertilizer because I want to... Oop!
[176:49.71]Look!
[176:51.67]Come here!
[176:55.41]Finally, my dream of having ducks and frogs and geckos is finally coming true!
[177:00.25]Yes!
[177:01.79]Plucky and Gaffy.
[177:20.77]And then Donald, uh, Daisy.
[177:26.00]We gotta have them all.
[177:37.25]Huey, Louie.
[177:41.41]Daffy.
[177:45.44]Get the crab?
[177:46.44]Um, I will.
[177:49.57]Alright, they need to eat a crab.
[177:51.79]So we need crab food.
[177:53.21]And crabs need a bunch of water and more sand.
[177:55.29]Let's put sand over here.
[177:58.03]This is such a chill-ass game.
[177:59.71]You know what I mean?
[178:01.71]This is fun just to do.
[178:03.20]Who cares?
[178:03.66]You know what I mean?
[178:04.12]It's just fucking... It's like Animal Crossing, but I can't play Animal Crossing right now because it's not here.
[178:09.44]Kim has it.
[178:10.28]Kim's playing Animal Crossing.
[178:11.08]She's probably having a ton of fun.
[178:12.76]But I've got my own version of Animal Crossing right now.
[178:14.86]You know what I'm saying?
[178:29.40]I don't want to be too sandy because the ducks probably don't like that.
[178:31.72]I would assume the ducks don't like sand.
[178:37.85]Do they?
[178:46.30]That's fine.
[178:53.42]I'll just replant it somewhere else.
[178:57.02]It looks like sand, right?
[179:01.99]Okay, that's alright.
[179:06.51]I'll just pull this.
[179:12.61]Just sell it, whatever.
[179:17.51]I see you.
[179:18.39]Wait.
[179:18.77]What is this?
[179:24.56]Tower of sour base.
[179:30.04]Can we see one?
[179:30.70]Can we see a sour tower guys?
[179:34.60]Don't you dare touch this pumpkin.
[179:46.02]There it is.
[179:46.46]Nice.
[179:46.75]Let's get the sour towel.
[179:50.19]I like it.
[179:50.55]I'm into it.
[179:53.51]I want someone to eat this pumpkin.
[179:54.59]Oh, another snake.
[179:59.38]You need to eat a mouse, right?
[180:01.30]Come on down.
[180:01.82]There's another one here.
[180:05.80]There's a mouse right here.
[180:09.10]You do have complete access to eating a mouse.
[180:12.93]Eat it.
[180:17.78]It's a snake.
[180:18.48]It's not a snake.

[180:36.16]What do you need?
[180:37.60]A turnip?
[180:39.14]I got a turnip right here.
[180:43.85]Eat that turnip and become resident.
[180:45.08]Because I want to breed them.
[180:46.90]Don't eat them.
[180:48.36]Mouse house.
[180:50.78]House of mouse.
[180:51.38]Gov.
[180:51.48]Just get it out there.
[181:14.39]Because then I'll have two.
[181:15.43]They can romance.
[181:17.50]They can breed.
[181:18.14]And then we can have a bunch of snakes.
[181:19.40]Come on in here.
[181:25.46]Come on.
[181:26.34]There's a turnip right here.

[182:53.29]Once I get the animals I want, we're gonna make a bunch of garden shit.
[182:55.71]We're gonna make a bunch of fertilizing.
[182:58.23]It'll be great.
[182:59.99]I want the animals that I want in here first.
[183:02.57]Snakes, ducks, and geckos.

[193:13.80]That is not a great use of your money.
[193:16.44]Not at all.
[193:17.59]That is not a use of your money.
[193:20.13]$100,000 for me to say the word shpee is just such a bad investment.
[193:26.63]That's not a good investment.
[193:30.77]There's so many other things you can do with that money.
[193:37.03]Eat this.

[205:29.07]Get in, get spending, then get... No, only joking.
[205:32.99]Take your time.
[205:37.49]Uh-oh.
[205:43.55]Well... It's alright.
[205:46.53]There's still three left.
[205:55.07]That means now you're a resident, right?
[205:56.45]And now I can breed you two.
[206:03.01]Wait.
[206:05.93]And where's the other one?
[206:06.95]You're over here somewhere.
[206:07.77]There.
[206:10.99]Eat.
[206:15.54]Are you a resident yet?
[206:19.98]Yeah!
[206:20.48]Okay, now mate.
[206:23.68]Actually, not yet.
[206:25.34]I want at least, like, five or six mice.
[206:28.34]What does it take to mate?
[206:32.59]You two need...
[206:35.13]Oh, shit.
[206:37.29]He's eaten one roe bean.
[206:43.52]Why am I making all these mice?
[206:49.60]I'm making mice for no reason then.
[206:52.84]For the cats, I guess?
[206:56.60]Well, then I don't want to have that many.
[206:58.14]Alright, you guys ready to romance?
[207:03.38]You're afraid of frogs, too?
[207:09.90]You're afraid of everything.
[207:13.77]You're afraid of frogs.
[207:14.83]You're afraid of snakes.
[207:21.29]I'm about to fucking launch these guys into a cannon.
[207:23.11]What do you think?
[207:29.12]You're still not ready yet.
[207:31.95]Alright, I can do more water and more sand because I just got this upgrade.
[207:35.54]Let's do some water over here.
[207:43.13]And you're scared of mice.
[207:45.85]The synergy here is not really that great.
[207:48.21]I've done kind of completely wrong, but it's okay.
[208:04.12]Nice.
[208:08.40]It's all water.
[208:09.24]Remember, I think you might have a problem.
[208:13.18]What's happening?
[208:16.47]Senada being hunted.
[208:24.03]Stop that!
[208:24.57]Did you just lick him?
[208:27.37]Leave him alone.
[208:37.37]No, you're right here.
[208:38.39]Are you stuck in here?
[208:44.56]You're stuck, aren't you?
[208:47.54]Oh, you dumbass.
[208:52.68]Come on, get out.
[209:02.85]Mouse Island.
[209:03.69]Well, we just need enough to have...
[209:06.73]Oh, there's another snake.
[209:10.98]Good thing they are mating, because here comes another one.
[209:17.18]Every time I make a new mouse, they just get eaten and killed by a snake that then becomes a resident.
[209:23.88]Whatever.
[209:24.36]Alright, let's go.
[209:34.16]Bad.
[209:35.38]Sorry.
[209:35.98]I can... No, I can't.
[209:40.63]I can get this one.
[209:53.10]Don't even fucking risk it.
[209:54.42]This is too terrible.
[210:05.76]Alright, new resident.
[210:07.02]So that means I have three.
[210:09.76]I have a lot of snakes.
[210:11.16]Where did I get these raw beans?
[210:17.01]Uh-oh.
[210:21.89]It's our sure bet.
[210:26.37]Can I get a, um... apple seed yet for the... Dead.
[210:38.16]Hey, you still not a resident?
[210:50.29]No, you're a resident, right?
[210:51.53]Alright, what did you drop for seeds?
[210:55.71]I don't know, planet.
[211:08.29]Can't plant.
[211:09.65]Is it just a- is it a- what is it?
[211:15.12]Uh, whatever.
[211:16.70]Oh, it's garlic.
[211:30.89]What's wrong with you?
[211:34.31]Oh, send him into the cannon.
[211:36.23]Send him into the cannon, right?
[211:39.01]Send him into the cannon Come here Where is he?
[211:56.37]Where is he?
[211:56.77]Where is he?
[211:57.61]There he is.
[211:58.21]Into the cannon
[212:08.24]Piñata sent to party.
[212:14.91]You get a lot of experience with doing that, huh?
[212:18.85]Almost 60% of a whole level.
[212:20.75]I still have two mice, right?
[212:23.85]Yeah.
[212:30.22]No, I don't want to go in.
[212:31.26]Wait, there's only two left.
[212:49.63]The selector is kind of finicky.
[212:51.13]It's almost like it doesn't want to attach to things that you're near.
[212:54.47]It just goes by them.
[212:57.64]It's finicky.
[213:03.52]Go to the tinkerer with a pumpkin.
[213:07.65]I think the pumpkin... Is that pumpkin gone?
[213:11.17]Oh, there it is.
[213:12.09]Go to the tinkerer with a pumpkin.
[213:15.45]Should I just throw it over there?
[213:16.65]How do I take... What do I do?
[213:23.84]You good to go?
[213:24.30]Well, get up and eat that yam.
[213:38.71]Is this a ladybug?
[213:40.17]Oh, no, it's just a toad.
[213:43.01]What the hell?
[213:47.51]What is going on?
[213:49.73]What's wrong with you?
[213:52.12]Wait, what?
[213:52.88]What's wrong with this thing?
[213:56.64]Oh.
[213:57.74]Okay.
[214:00.26]They do that, right.
[214:05.66]Okay.
[214:08.31]I don't want the birds.
[214:08.97]Fuck, I gotta go.
[214:24.66]I gotta go, I gotta go.
[214:26.32]But I don't wanna, but I gotta.
[214:31.01]I'll be back tomorrow.
[214:37.69]This is so inefficient, it's unbelievable.
[214:46.55]It's like the most inefficient thing ever.
[214:47.91]I'm not even gonna get it.
[215:03.04]Coin bonus, good.
[215:05.62]Fine, just leave.
[215:10.68]Don't worry, I'll be back tomorrow.
[215:12.34]And the next day.
[215:14.18]Don't worry.
[215:16.32]I do want to... I do want to do a few things, though.
[215:19.52]I need... Alright, I got three snakes, two ducks, one frog.
[215:24.40]Let's take inventory.
[215:25.28]What's the thing on the top right?
[215:40.54]Pepehands, just go.
[215:41.88]Get out of here.
[215:45.83]Not yet.
[215:46.27]Hold on.
[215:50.35]Just go, Pepehands.
[215:58.10]Just go.
[215:58.82]Get out of here already.
[215:59.90]What the hell was that?
[216:16.07]Eat.
[216:19.91]Fucking leave.
[216:21.99]No, hey!
[216:32.30]Mate.
[216:38.08]Okay.
[216:38.86]That's it.
[216:39.32]I'm not doing any more mating with the mice.
[216:43.10]Now I just want to make sure that there's enough water.
[216:53.31]You're not going anywhere.
[216:54.35]Okay, what's the efficient way to do this?
[216:57.83]It's to go... Left side.
[217:01.93]I don't know.
[217:09.05]Like this.
[217:09.48]Okay.
[217:43.28]Who said I wasn't gonna get it?
[217:44.66]Who said?
[217:45.06]I wanna know, who said it?
[217:53.15]Bard.
[217:54.59]Bard!
[217:56.43]Bard!
[217:57.95]This is a fucking yam.
[217:59.47]Sell it.
[218:01.43]Sell this yam too.
[218:02.17]I don't fucking want it.
[218:06.48]Alright.
[218:06.98]Now.
[218:09.42]Let's get a couple seeds.
[218:12.28]Let's do some more water.
[218:14.08]Up there in the corner like I wanted.
[218:15.44]And then let's do some water on the left.
[218:17.58]For the ducks.
[218:19.04]What is this?
[218:19.46]This thing's fucked up looking.
[218:30.22]What is it?
[218:31.32]It's a chili.
[218:37.48]Just leave.
[218:38.22]Leave.
[218:38.78]I'm fine.
[218:40.74]I've got like 10 minutes.
[218:43.71]I've got 10 minutes.
[218:45.19]Hey, this guy's using that water.
[218:50.93]That's not... You can't use that water.
[218:53.21]You've got to live here.
[218:55.49]That's right.
[218:55.87]Get in here and live here.
[219:00.96]Alright, we can send that mouse into a cannon.
[219:09.61]Move.
[219:16.09]Okay.
[219:24.24]That's alright.
[219:25.00]And then I'm going to do the front of the duck house.
[219:28.96]Over here.
[219:36.88]I can still hear him.
[219:37.66]It's like he never left.
[219:48.16]It's like he's still here.
[219:49.78]Ooh, Pond City.
[219:55.54]Hot mic, hot mic, hot mic.
[220:00.18]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[220:04.30]Alright, that looks good for now.
[220:05.86]We'll pick up tomorrow.
[220:07.08]Around the same time.
[220:09.18]We'll pick it up tomorrow.
[220:12.84]Thank you for joining me, everybody.
[220:16.93]On this weekend of short streams.
[220:21.29]We'll see you tomorrow.
[220:24.13]Just make sure it looks alright.
[220:25.57]It looks awful.
[220:26.97]But, you know.
[220:27.49]Wait, I can connect it down here.
[220:36.40]Oh, that looks a little better.
[220:37.14]That's much better.
[220:49.58]Why is... Fill Pond and Dig Pond the same button?
[220:54.62]Shouldn't it be a different button?
[220:56.28]I'm getting angry at a fucking kid's game.
[221:01.05]Holy shit, Jeremy.
[221:02.63]This game was made...
[221:07.25]It's not a penis.
[221:09.01]It's a penis.
[221:09.84]Sad face.
[221:12.10]Feels bad, man.
[221:13.14]It's a penis.
[221:16.04]This is not a penis.
[221:18.52]Okay?
[221:19.48]It's not.
[221:25.03]Why are you doing sad face about that?
[221:26.87]Don't you guys like that?
[221:28.51]You guys think that penis humor is hysterical to you guys, I thought.
[221:46.25]It is.
[221:46.71]It is.
[221:48.15]I think it's very funny.
[221:53.99]What is... Coins?
[221:56.35]Oh, that's cool.
[221:58.98]Alright, that looks alright.
[222:01.28]Over here is kind of a disaster, but we'll get it.
[222:03.68]We'll fix it.
[222:05.18]Come on.
[222:06.44]Come on.
[222:12.15]Just random water.
[222:13.77]No, we're gonna change this.
[222:14.93]We're gonna patch this up.
[222:17.29]Alright, I gotta go.
[222:18.19]I actually really do.
[222:19.27]I have to leave.
[222:22.11]Doing what I can fill in.
[222:23.45]What did I say?
[222:26.25]Three to four hours?
[222:26.89]There, there you go.
[222:29.17]Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
[222:31.81]Let's wrap this up.
[222:32.47]Let's hang out for a little bit and do the bits.
[222:39.10]Leave.
[222:39.44]Scram.
[222:39.84]Get out of here.
[222:43.09]No, not you.
[222:43.49]Should I just keep this music on?
[222:56.13]No.
[222:57.63]Alright.
[222:59.35]Wait, how do I save the game?
[223:00.82]That's very important.
[223:01.52]It just auto-saves, right?
[223:08.80]There we go.
[223:09.20]Are you sure you want to save and quit?
[223:12.52]Yes.
[223:15.54]Do I have a profile?
[223:16.24]Yes, I do.
[223:21.68]When will the gifter highest tip bit leader work?
[223:24.02]Never.
[223:24.87]Probably never.
[223:25.39]I hope your data gets corrupted.
[223:31.29]Holy shit.
[223:32.01]Oh my god.
[223:36.41]What the hell?
[223:37.92]What the hell, man?
[223:39.72]Why?
[223:42.68]Because then he can play Doom.
[223:45.87]I mean, that's... Well, no.
[223:48.56]We would actually be playing No More Heroes or Beautiful Joe.
[223:50.82]It wouldn't go right to Doom.
[223:51.74]Alright, let's do the bits and the subs and everything.
[223:58.72]Only about four hours, so... We should go through this pretty quickly.
[224:04.64]We had $10 from LM, man.
[224:06.52]Thanks for the $10.
[224:07.38]Jeremy, if you were a piñata interviewer, what kind of piñata would you be?
[224:13.32]I would just be one of the seeds.
[224:15.28]You just plant me in the ground and just make sure I have enough water.
[224:17.62]And I'll just sit there.
[224:20.50]And I'll be fine.
[224:24.33]Thanks for the 1,000 bits, though.
[224:26.61]Pixelated cabbage, thanks for the 450 bits.
[224:29.37]Love them streams, Jerma, man.
[224:30.99]Good luck with the move.
[224:31.79]Thanks a lot.
[224:33.99]Appreciate that.
[224:34.43]Thank you.
[224:36.11]It is going.
[224:38.43]Uh, LM Man again.
[224:39.33]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[224:40.27]Kiss, marry, kill.
[224:41.33]Uh, Drew Crew, Moo Crew, or the Wink Dinks.
[224:50.00]Uh, alright.
[224:59.12]How do I flee the country?
[225:04.17]um you can't uh alright I well murius is just it's like so cute I would give I would here I like kiss Otto's head so I would kiss the book or kiss murius uh I would marry the drew crew
[225:27.57]Because the Dru crew is just so, so incredibly passionate.
[225:31.34]They are so dedicated.
[225:32.84]They're incredibly loyal.
[225:34.52]I don't know if that makes sense.
[225:37.02]And I would... Winkdinks would be eliminated.
[225:48.18]I wouldn't... They would just be... I would not hang out with them anymore.
[225:51.60]Okay.
[225:54.22]That's based.
[225:55.40]No, I don't even... I... I...
[225:58.10]Alright, I answered your fucked up question.
[226:01.04]Potion dweller, thanks for 250.
[226:02.28]Jeremy's garden when you're here, your family.
[226:04.16]I stole that from you.
[226:05.34]And I immediately gave you credit for it five seconds later, so it's not stealing if it's an attribution.
[226:11.54]Fire Rosie, thanks for the 600 bits.
[226:14.12]Thank you for admitting how much fun stuffed animals are, because my dad always calls me a furry.
[226:19.88]Or a plushopildiac for liking them.
[226:24.20]Thank you for the charm and the fun.
[226:29.14]Um, no, you're not a furry if you like.
[226:31.10]No, excuse me, I gotta correct this.
[226:33.28]You're not a furry if you like, uh, Vive Piñata.
[226:38.30]Because this is you taking care of animals.
[226:40.75]This is not you pretending to be the animals on screen.
[226:45.81]I'm taking care of these animals.
[226:48.11]I'm not pretending to be the animal on the screen, you know what I'm saying?
[226:50.43]What do I mean wrong?
[226:56.92]Like, if I was in the chair, and I made that frog, and that frog was supposed to be me, then okay, that's like, okay, that's my fursona, right?
[227:04.81]From my understanding.
[227:06.80]I'm taking, I am a farmer, I'm taking care of ants, I'm a farmer, like, shelter, whatever.
[227:11.30]Yeah, there you go.
[227:15.43]Sorry, I had to correct that.
[227:17.51]Hey Jamie, thanks for the 500 bits.
[227:18.57]Hey Jerma, today is my 24th birthday and your return is one of the best presents I could have ever asked for.
[227:23.37]Hope you and the others are staying safe in these scary times.
[227:25.77]You as well.
[227:26.15]Stay safe.
[227:29.85]Happy birthday.
[227:30.83]Happy 24th birthday, Jamie.
[227:35.41]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[227:36.73]Happy birthday.
[227:38.39]Happy...
[227:47.09]Thank you!
[228:05.47]He's doing it on a kazoo!
[228:11.28]Hey, Transco, thanks for the 500 bits.
[228:12.86]Hey, Jeremiah, have you ever played Graffiti Kingdom?
[228:15.36]I remember it being really weird when I played it as a kid.
[228:17.84]You might like how wacky it is.
[228:18.96]Good luck with the rest of your move.
[228:20.24]Thanks a lot.
[228:21.74]Graffiti Kingdom, I've never played.
[228:26.39]Graffiti Kingdom.
[228:29.13]Let's look it up.
[228:29.55]What is it?
[228:32.55]Graffiti Kingdom is... Oh, this is an old game, huh?
[228:38.43]PlayStation 2.
[228:45.24]What'd he do?
[228:46.40]That's pretty good.
[228:50.24]Do you read these, or did I just waste 1,200 bubble shirts?
[228:56.70]Well, that answers your question.
[229:02.49]You draw your own character.
[229:04.23]Okay, well, that's all I need to know.
[229:05.37]Put it on the list.
[229:08.17]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[229:10.23]Where's my keys?
[229:11.09]Thanks for the 1,000 bits.
[229:12.11]Please do a Chocolate Factory stream, Jerma.
[229:14.25]Thanks for being one of the one guys to make that stream happen, and it will happen.
[229:20.12]I just can't say that it'll happen now, because obviously of all the coronavirus stuff, I'm not sure that would be possible.
[229:28.38]We'll see, though.
[229:31.78]Thank you, Appleship for the 250.
[229:32.78]Hey, Owen, when will the next community content night be?
[229:35.79]P.S.
[229:36.07]Welcome back.
[229:37.65]Sort of.
[229:39.06]Welcome back to Sort of.
[229:40.24]Not here at 100% yet.
[229:44.78]Um... April... April... April 5th.
[230:05.38]April 5th will be the next Community Content Night.
[230:07.28]Sunday, April 5th.
[230:14.69]What year?
[230:15.27]2020.
[230:16.09]There you go.
[230:21.03]Me too, it's a really fun, chill game.
[230:23.53]Yeah, we're taking it slow.
[230:45.87]And we need to kind of get to where we need to be.
[230:50.51]And do it slow.
[230:52.69]At a good pace.
[230:54.27]But slow enough where we can actually get stuff done.
[230:56.27]And to work around some of the companies that have some coronavirus restrictions.
[231:08.06]We're taking it slow.
[231:13.97]But thanks for the $2.50.
[231:14.45]Uh, stay safe.
[231:18.61]Kill... Killcrun.
[231:20.57]Or kill... Killcrun.
[231:23.13]Thanks for the thread.
[231:23.69]I don't know why I couldn't read that.
[231:24.99]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[231:25.82]Jerma, what about Rain World?
[231:27.12]You completely forgot about it.
[231:28.24]Please play more.
[231:28.84]It's a good... And Slugcat is cute.
[231:30.84]Please play more.
[231:31.48]It's a good game.
[231:32.08]Pepehands.
[231:32.72]Fuck.
[231:38.50]Um... What do I do now?
[231:41.76]We crossed the threshold.
[231:42.77]Those of you that don't know, some of you new viewers don't know what the threshold is.
[231:46.91]And that's in huge quotes.
[231:48.85]The threshold is, I play a game, and I say, yeah, I might go back to this.
[231:54.17]Maybe next week or something.
[231:56.59]And two weeks go by.
[231:58.31]After the 14th day, you've passed the threshold on if I'm going to go back and play it.
[232:06.38]So, we've passed it.
[232:12.39]Hollow Knight, Pepehands.
[232:16.86]Hmm.
[232:21.26]DOS games.
[232:22.00]No.
[232:23.06]Fucking Pepehands.
[232:26.79]Sir's Wrath DLC.
[232:28.75]Oh, Pepehands.
[232:38.31]He promised to play Half Life Alyx.
[232:40.45]Well, put your Pepe hands down for a second on that one.
[232:44.85]I want to play that.
[232:45.73]I want to play VR.
[232:46.55]There's like so many good VR games, I just can't physically do it right now.
[232:49.23]That's not a Pepe hand scenario.
[232:51.01]That's a you-wait-and-see scenario.
[232:53.33]We didn't pass the threshold on that one.
[232:56.53]Still there.
[233:02.42]Sit down and play Alyx?
[233:05.22]I think the device on my head...
[233:09.10]Because it's kind of heavy and annoying.
[233:11.67]I feel like that's going to put pressure down on me.
[233:13.93]I... Very soon here I'm going to have some actual real answers for what I'm doing with my life.
[233:22.18]In regards to my medical stuff.
[233:24.14]So... We'll cross that bridge soon.
[233:33.52]Reason for the short stream?
[233:35.12]Yes.
[233:35.74]The next few streams will be like this.
[233:38.24]Because right after I turn this off, I'm going back to the moving process.
[233:45.82]I just wanted to make sure that I didn't not stream for potentially like a full week or two straight.
[233:53.72]Because I do want to stream.
[233:54.86]I want to hang out and play games and just chill and dick around.
[233:57.31]I love doing it.
[233:58.85]So anytime I can put some time in and do what I want to, so...
[234:09.76]He just wants to eat a burrito.
[234:11.32]Stop!
[234:13.14]Don't say that.
[234:17.84]He's gonna move from his stream computer to his bed.
[234:21.47]He's just gonna sit in the chair till 4 Pacific.
[234:29.14]Oh my god.
[234:31.64]Anyways, Dark Saul, thanks for the 250.
[234:33.34]Tonight I learned that trying to fake VR with Resident Evil 2 first person in 4px makes you instantly sick.
[234:41.11]Never try that shit.
[234:43.08]Also, when are you going to collaborate with someone from Hollow Live?
[234:45.56]You've already said Ayaya, so you may as well.
[234:48.34]I have no idea what that is.
[234:55.33]If you said, I will give you a million dollars if you tell me what Hololive is, I would not get the million dollars.
[235:03.45]I would cry and go home and be like, how the fuck?
[235:05.27]I don't know what that is.
[235:07.67]Oh, I said the word.
[235:08.39]Yeah, whatever.
[235:11.60]He said it.
[235:12.10]Get him.
[235:12.61]Obstinar, wall lover.
[235:14.01]Thanks for the $2.78.
[235:16.15]Bits, do you prefer 2K14 WWE or 2K15 to 2K20 creative?
[235:22.69]He's doing emote contest.
[235:25.49]Everything after 2K14 is absolute dog shit.
[235:30.78]They just pulled the rug out from underneath the creative process that that game had after 2K14.
[235:36.91]2K15 all the way to now, it's just been utter dog shit.
[235:40.93]Just dog shit.
[235:42.83]They cared more about having a realistic fucking sports simulation than having fun characters fight each other in a rink.
[235:48.93]That's what happened.
[235:49.89]That is just what happened when the companies changed over.
[235:51.73]The new company that took it over was like, let's make this a sports game.
[235:55.58]And it was the biggest mistake that they ever made.
[235:58.20]And from my understanding, the last one they made was an absolute total fucking joke of a video game.
[236:03.48]It was riddled with just awful bugs, no new features.
[236:06.77]It was a piece of dog shit from what I've heard.
[236:09.35]So it did.
[236:10.45]It turned into like a Madden or like an MLB 2K fucking 20, but they just release a roster update and tweak the fucking fighting mechanics.
[236:20.49]He's so passionate about this.
[236:22.17]Yeah, I am because that's one of my favorite things on Earth.
[236:26.53]Was making characters in wrestling games and making them fight each other.
[236:31.05]I've been doing this shit since I was like fucking 13.
[236:32.71]Oh, I mean, I could, we could sit here with, I could sit and grab a fucking cup of coffee right now and sit here for two hours and talk to you about how much of a, how much of a fucking injustice this is.
[236:43.54]I would sit here for like an hour straight.
[236:48.48]Anyways, it was a big mistake, and I don't know who was responsible for that.
[236:54.09]There's a lot of people, a lot of moving parts in that, where making it a more realistic sports kind of game, rather than, look, you're making a bunch of crazy monsters and you're doing fighting and CPUs are fighting each other in the ring.
[237:08.34]I don't know, but they've been stripping pieces of it for the last five years, so...
[237:16.80]I would do 2K14, I would play it, and I would continue to make characters and do rumbles on it.
[237:22.21]But it's so old at this point, it takes forever to do fucking anything in that engine.
[237:27.59]If you have more than 5, 10, 15 layers, 5 layers on a character, and you're painting on their face with something, you'll press the button to do a circle, and wait 4 straight seconds for the game to load the circle.
[237:41.92]It's just old at this point on old hardware, it's not...
[237:46.78]It's just, I can't, I could never go back and do that again.
[237:52.89]Wait for that new AEW game.
[237:54.55]We'll see.
[237:55.15]We'll see what happens.
[237:56.81]I know that, um, was it Yuke's?
[237:59.29]Didn't, Yuke's broke off completely and was like, fuck this, we want to make our own video game.
[238:04.10]From my, from my understanding, that's in big quotes.
[238:07.67]Yuke's was like, this is boring the fuck out of us.
[238:10.81]We need to creatively reimagine the series a little bit for ourselves, and we want to make another game that's a wrestling game.
[238:17.35]That's what I've heard.
[238:20.79]That's very encouraging, because let's hope that they actually make something fun.
[238:26.98]I wish them the absolute best of luck.
[238:30.50]And all the support, and I hope they're passionate, and I hope they make something good.
[238:33.28]That's all I can do.
[238:39.81]What?
[238:40.13]Moving on?
[238:41.11]Uh, thank you NV11casting for the 250.
[238:46.17]Remember, yesterday was my 21st birthday and it was pretty stressful.
[238:49.12]I can think of no better birthday gift than my favorite streamer, this is in all capitals, singing happy birthday as poorly as possible.
[239:02.03]Jokes!
[239:02.35]Oh, it's a joke.
[239:03.19]It was a joke.
[239:04.05]They say jokes aside, you don't have to sing if you don't want to.
[239:07.49]Look at that.
[239:09.24]But I'd appreciate any beverage suggestions you might have.
[239:12.29]Thanks for the laughs.
[239:13.75]I got one for you.
[239:17.51]Sprite.
[239:17.83]A little bit of cranberry juice.
[239:20.35]Squeeze of lime.
[239:23.89]Pretty good.
[239:32.23]Happy... No, the rest.
[239:37.69]Happy birthday.
[239:39.93]Hey, Trans Scout, thanks for the 500 bits.
[239:41.67]I'm playing... I'm planning on getting two rats next semester and I'm in the process of coming up with names.
[239:45.89]Do you have any suggestions?
[239:47.76]Um... Yeah.
[239:49.46]Black and blue.
[239:52.32]You know, because they fucking prey at night and they fucking stalk at night.
[240:01.91]Those are shit names?
[240:06.85]Like they're bruises, yeah.
[240:09.59]To the two bruisers!
[240:14.25]You have to try, try harder.
[240:21.41]I like those names.
[240:22.15]Try, what do you mean try harder?
[240:28.14]Spaghetti and meatballs.
[240:29.30]That's way worse than what I said.
[240:36.01]If you name... Don't name any of your animals Fart.
[240:39.21]Fart.
[240:39.51]That's such a bad... What a terrible name.
[240:41.25]Don't... No.
[240:46.50]I can't believe people are laughing at that.
[240:47.98]Like, give me a break, guys.
[240:50.74]Really?
[240:56.75]My... Well, my cat's name is Fart.
[240:59.39]Fart.
[241:04.20]Okay, the funny thing is, you wouldn't think that was real, but if it was, that's actually kind of funny that it is real, because it's such a, that's such a rotten, awful, terrible name.
[241:16.03]That if you just saw, like, fart the cat lying down on the windowsill or something, just sitting there with his eyes closed, like, holy shit, that is the cat's name.
[241:34.20]That's such a bad name.
[241:35.22]Don't name your cat Bart.
[241:41.61]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[241:43.45]Uh, Scruffle, thanks for the 400 bits.
[241:44.91]Cough, cough.
[241:45.61]I don't know.
[241:47.11]I don't understand.
[241:48.07]What's this?
[241:48.35]Why are you coughing?
[241:50.39]Did I say... Are you, like, trying to tell me something?
[241:52.44]Like, hey, excuse me.
[241:54.80]What did I do?
[241:55.54]What did I say?
[241:58.17]Tar Alacrin, thanks for the 250 bits.
[242:01.03]I doubted that you would stream this weekend.
[242:03.68]I was gravely in error.
[242:05.40]However, I'm a man of my word and gave you permission to ban me if you streamed, and chat must have their ban.
[242:11.60]I throw myself at the mercy of you and chat and ask that you commute my sentence from a lifetime ban to only a ban for a week.
[242:20.05]I swear I will be a reformed chatter who never doubts the streamer.
[242:49.64]No mercy thumbs down thumbs down What do you mean I actually did it?
[242:57.37]What do you mean?
[243:00.69]We have to have justice
[243:05.62]It's like, ah, sire, I'm so sorry.
[243:08.56]Yes, I threw a javelin through your window and skimmed your forehead and was trying to kill you.
[243:16.23]I was trying to murder you, sire.
[243:18.95]But please just know that fuck you and I hate you.
[243:24.29]But I am willing for you to drop me into the pit of the lions.
[243:28.33]But just know that I only expect to be in there for a day.
[243:32.17]And if I can make it a day, then I want you to release me.
[243:36.98]He's like, you don't... Sir, you don't make the terms.
[243:41.63]It seems your terms are unacceptable.
[243:50.51]That was a convoluted example.
[243:52.77]He'll be back in a... I'll unban him tomorrow.
[244:00.36]It's fine.
[244:01.20]I'll put my hand down to the fucking lion pit.
[244:05.01]And I'd be like, I'm just kidding.
[244:06.64]It was a joke.
[244:07.92]Let me see your... And then my hand gets fucking ripped off.
[244:14.85]It turns out hubris is the real killer.
[244:21.50]Anyways, what happened?
[244:23.02]I just banned somebody for, like, yeah, okay, I'll unban him tomorrow.
[244:26.26]I'll probably forget.
[244:28.04]Guys, I've, like, told you that I was playing a certain game, like, tomorrow, and I don't play it.
[244:31.92]So if I'm gonna forget about what I'm even streaming tomorrow, you think I'm gonna remember unbanning this guy?
[244:41.43]I'm gonna forget.
[244:42.49]I'm gonna forget forever.
[244:44.51]Okay, one of the mods, unban Tara Alacrin as of tomorrow at 7.32pm Pacific Standard Time.
[244:54.12]I have a ban log.
[244:55.10]Okay.
[244:56.56]And I did ban the right person.
[244:57.70]There was no misspelling there.
[244:59.42]I didn't, like, add, like, an extra C or something.
[245:04.36]Okay.
[245:05.95]Hey, Gooberry Juice.
[245:06.67]Thanks for the $2.50.
[245:07.51]I doubted that you would stream this week, and I was gravely in error.
[245:10.01]However, I'm a man of my word and gave you permission to ban me if you streamed.
[245:13.57]Chat must have their ban.
[245:15.09]I throw... Wait.
[245:15.87]Why is another person saying this?
[245:31.86]Just ban that guy too.
[245:43.33]You banned the wrong guy.
[245:44.49]Alright, that was goo berry juice.
[245:50.93]Okay, by the way, just, I'll give you another convoluted, fucked up, messed up, like, go around in five circles example.
[245:57.69]If there's a guy in front of you, and he's robbed a bank, okay?
[246:02.91]And he's got a bag of money, and he's like, I gotta get out of here, I just robbed a fucking bank!
[246:07.79]And, like, money is flying out of his, the bag, and he's running down the street, and he's like, Woo!
[246:13.17]Cops everywhere, you're just watching this happen.
[246:15.79]don't um don't run after that guy and chant that you're also robbing the bank at the same time like me too I'm robbing the bank too yeah we both together we're both robbing the bank together I don't think you should do that you're gonna get you're gonna get arrested uh because that's just what happened and I've got him I've got justice has to be served
[246:50.21]You don't want to participate in that.
[246:52.85]I'm just saying.
[246:53.77]Hey, Gravenbrace, thanks for 250.
[246:55.17]I streamed Doom for 14 and a half hours.
[246:58.68]I would say it's pretty good, but look out for the glitches.
[247:01.14]Some bosses have invincibility mechanics that depend on range, but doesn't properly gauge the range.
[247:06.52]Other than that, it's a... Whoa, that sounds terrible.
[247:09.67]Can't wait to not play that terrible fucking game.
[247:12.51]Wow.
[247:13.45]Maybe there's a bug.
[247:14.21]There's a small, like, glitch or something.
[247:16.85]Get that off my list.
[247:18.09]I want nothing to do with it.
[247:22.25]I am appalled and offended that it would be released in a state like that.
[247:28.41]I want nothing to do with it.
[247:29.68]Actually, why would I stream it?
[247:31.02]Yeah, thank you.
[247:32.16]Why would I stream that game?
[247:34.42]God, y'all ain't thinking I haven't played it in my own time.
[247:41.99]I'm not going to stream it now.
[247:45.19]Hey, Goiki, thanks for the 500 bits.
[247:47.57]Attention, streamer.
[247:48.53]I hope the move and everything went well.
[247:50.23]Happy to have you back, even if it's for short streams.
[247:52.27]Dear my heart, attention, streamer, over.
[247:55.85]Thanks.
[247:57.05]Why is he so mad?
[247:57.97]I don't know.
[248:01.42]I'm not.
[248:02.24]I'm not even fucking mad.
[248:03.54]Oh, shit.
[248:04.26]I gotta quickly, quickly, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[248:06.36]Whoa!
[248:06.84]Uh-oh.
[248:10.75]Hey, there they are.
[248:11.57]Let's roll the credits.
[248:14.25]Here come the subs.
[248:14.87]Thanks for the subs, guys.
[248:15.65]All of you.
[248:16.83]Appreciate it.
[248:17.27]I've been gone for a while.
[248:20.94]And you'll see me in bits and pieces here over the next few days.
[248:25.96]While I continue to get this all done.
[248:29.20]I really appreciate it.
[248:29.90]Thank you for your patience.
[248:32.28]Because I know that a lot of people right now are kind of just in their houses looking for something to do.
[248:40.93]And I'm kind of the same way.
[248:43.43]So I would love to be here.
[248:49.78]Just, I have to get this done.
[248:55.74]I'll see you tomorrow.
[248:57.61]We'll keep going with Viva Piñata Travel in Paradise.
[249:00.99]Thanks for the support, all of you.
[249:08.31]There's a piñata in the corner.
[249:12.60]They might be.
[249:15.10]Thanks for the subs.
[249:16.56]We have some bits to do left.
[249:17.50]There's still a little bit left.
[249:18.94]We have RTX 420 69 Ti.
[249:22.95]Eventually, they'll have to have that number, or they'll just skip it because they're too embarrassed to have it.
[249:29.15]Thanks for the 250.
[249:29.61]Hey, Germs, I went shopping recently and I realized that Jerma Raptor is incorrect and inaccurate.
[249:36.33]What?
[249:36.51]I don't understand.
[249:41.47]JermaRaptor is incorrect and inaccurate.
[249:46.11]Because you went shopping?
[249:47.13]I don't get it.
[249:51.39]He's a fake.
[249:55.59]Oh, and they say there's another 250.
[249:57.88]Oops, I did my bits early.
[249:59.04]Here's what I meant to say.
[249:59.80]JermaRaptor is inaccurate.
[250:04.42]Oh.
[250:08.20]I see.
[250:08.52]Okay.
[250:11.15]Okay, so that's the, yeah, well, what, that's the, they look the same.
[250:15.67]A raptor face is a, whatever.
[250:21.96]It's not, it's a, ugh.
[250:26.28]Really gonna, you're gonna throw me under the bus here?
[250:31.22]Look, that's a raptor.
[250:32.98]That's not a raptor, that's E.T.
[250:36.68]Look.
[250:42.92]Can I just tell you something?
[250:44.96]Let's go.
[250:45.20]Five stars.
[250:46.00]There are 519 ratings.
[250:46.96]And this thing, people love this shit.
[250:54.70]Look at those reviews.
[251:17.16]Why are there so many people getting the Velociraptor one?
[251:19.64]The T-Rex one has 10 reviews, and the Velociraptor one is 500.
[251:24.25]But what's with people don't want the T-Rex one?
[251:27.35]Why?
[251:30.31]Because it's a Sansraptor.
[251:33.54]Okay, you and like 16 other people know what that is.
[251:36.74]The people buying these toys don't care that this is a Sansraptor.
[251:44.21]Why does everything have to be safe?
[251:45.47]It's like, and I see it too.
[251:46.81]Why is everything... Hey, Reaper500, thanks for the $2.50.
[251:55.30]Hey, Germboy, minister convinced chat to stop to shop.
[251:59.44]To stop asking you to show something if you use your Jerm powers to stop this pandemic.
[252:06.47]I wish I could.
[252:08.05]I would love to have this all go away.
[252:12.72]Uh, I- I'm not gonna say the thing you want me to say, because that makes- that means people will, uh, say it over and over again and never stop saying it.
[252:20.09]Uh, the more that you talk about things like this, the more that people, uh, go, uh, let me say that.
[252:23.87]So, uh, no, not BLT.
[252:26.95]We're- we got- we're over that already.
[252:28.55]And I just said it.
[252:29.46]I just fucked it all up.
[252:31.22]Um, I had to just tell- okay.
[252:34.50]Gnarly, thanks for the 250.
[252:35.74]Good luck on the move, David.
[252:36.94]Thanks a lot.
[252:38.72]That is my name.
[252:39.96]It's David.
[252:42.96]Thank you for the 250.
[252:43.42]Uh, cause I- I've invested in the Drew Crew.
[252:47.47]I bought the fucking Drew Crew Super Pack.
[252:49.11]Which has, like, 35 games in it.
[252:50.47]So, I have a very vested interest.
[253:16.58]Play more of it then.
[253:17.40]I know, but I... That's, that's, that's like last resort streams.
[253:24.43]You have to, you have to understand.
[253:26.75]That's like, oh no, there is nothing left for me to do.
[253:30.82]That sounds bad.
[253:36.07]Those are great games to have when it's like, oh, the thing that we're doing turns out sucked or really wasn't fun at all.
[253:42.42]I have nothing else to do and I don't have any plan and I have nothing set up.
[253:46.60]Okay, we'll open up Nancy Drew.
[253:52.42]Apocalypse stream, yeah.
[253:55.62]Those are excuses as a last resort.
[254:00.51]Yeah, Drew Crew is not my first choice for what I want to do on a day-to-day basis.
[254:06.63]It was.
[254:07.29]It was.
[254:08.59]I mean... It was.
[254:10.65]It was.
[254:14.36]It was.
[254:20.30]Those... You... You said you would marry them.
[254:27.99]Rain World is second to Dru Crew.
[254:30.97]What do you want me to tell you?
[254:32.17]What do you want from me?
[254:34.51]Hey, okay.
[254:36.07]Uh, no, thank you.
[254:37.97]Okage... Okageshado.
[254:43.01]It's hard for me to read this name because it's all in lowercase and I don't have... There it is.
[254:47.02]Okageshado King.
[254:50.80]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[254:51.80]I'm fucking stupid.
[254:53.10]Hi, Gerber.
[254:53.52]Really love your streams.
[254:54.16]They've been a good way to find happiness in the current hell we are all in.
[254:57.88]Would you ever play a Disgaea game?
[255:00.18]Probably not.
[255:05.79]Probably not.
[255:11.83]Yeah, where are the wink dinkers at?
[255:13.55]Sad face.
[255:15.49]I don't think there are any, there's not very many anymore.
[255:18.83]I don't think there's very many wink dinkers.
[255:23.80]I think there never was very many wink dinkers to begin with.
[255:28.79]You had some bandwagon wink dinkers that kind of jumped off after winks went away and
[255:43.42]I can't even read that.
[255:44.08]You're fucking crazy.
[255:46.04]Hey, morning maple.
[255:46.88]Thanks for the 250.
[255:47.42]Hey, Jerma 4, I forget.
[255:48.70]There's a game you can get on the PC and Switch that I think you enjoy called Piku Niku.
[255:55.43]It's a short physics-based puzzle exploration game.
[255:57.99]I think it'd be worth streaming because it could be beaten in just one stream or two if you play your cards right.
[256:04.19]The humor can be a bit LOL so random.
[256:07.45]And there's a cringy meme or two in there.
[256:09.48]But the gameplay is consistently fun.
[256:10.88]Here's the trailer.
[256:12.68]Good luck with the boo.
[256:19.02]LOL so random.
[256:23.04]Okay, I'll give this trailer 10 seconds.
[256:24.16]Okay.
[256:35.02]It looks alright.
[256:39.35]It looks alright.
[256:44.95]This hour, please.
[256:46.51]Floygan 2.
[256:49.21]Show us.
[256:51.45]No, I don't want to show you guys.
[256:52.30]I don't want you to see.
[256:55.32]You want to see what a stream could be?
[256:56.94]No, I want you to be surprised.
[257:03.76]He's too lazy to put the browser source on and resize the window to YouTube.
[257:10.64]He's a toxic streamer.
[257:12.30]I'm not a fucking toxic streamer.
[257:13.72]What the fuck are you talking about?
[257:15.20]And finally, we have 250 from Jason.
[257:25.37]Thank you, Jason.
[257:27.29]Here's the person you're supposed to ban for life.
[257:29.21]I already did.
[257:34.78]This is, uh, this is Tara Alec, where they've been banned.
[257:38.00]They did, they says, but they said.
[257:39.22]They said.
[257:40.52]Here's this, and I quote.
[257:42.46]That's the right guy.
[257:43.28]Yeah, it is.
[257:43.64]It's the right guy.
[258:05.45]You didn't move though.
[258:08.47]Look, I'm in the process of moving.
[258:11.09]That's why I took the last four or five days off.
[258:17.02]It's a process.
[258:17.92]What do you mean it doesn't count?
[258:23.14]You didn't move and didn't stream a full stream.
[258:26.86]Um, four hours, alright.
[258:29.36]Four, four and a half hours, that's a stream.
[258:32.70]If this was like two hours, okay, I'd understand.
[258:35.78]If this is like 2016, two hour stream, Jerma, sure.
[258:39.99]Four, four and a half, five, that's four and a half, that's a stream.
[258:43.15]Alright, that's a stream.
[258:47.83]You still didn't move?
[258:50.89]I bet assumed you'd be in a new place and you're not.
[258:55.83]They're only banned for one day.
[258:56.87]It's okay.
[258:57.47]It'll... What constitutes... Yeah, what constitutes a full stream?
[259:03.71]What is a full stream?
[259:05.83]Does it have to be six hours?
[259:10.77]Eight hours.
[259:13.33]At least six hours.
[259:15.01]Six to eight hours.
[259:15.91]At least 24.
[259:22.36]Six minimum.

[259:57.77]I'm just doing my civic duty.
[260:05.00]Oh, you see, my client said full stream, and Jerma985, a typical full stream from Jerma985 is anywhere between six and eight hours, sometimes even longer than that, your honor.
[260:16.19]And you tell me this man comes in on a Saturday after not streaming for four or five straight days, and only turns the stream on for about four to five hours.
[260:26.37]and says specifically, in the beginning of said stream, that this is not a real stream, that these are going to be shorter streams that are not going to be typical.
[260:35.17]Your Honor, you should throw the book at him.
[260:39.70]Not at my client, at Dermo.
[260:42.28]And... Aim for his chest.
[260:47.48]Aim for his shoulder.
[260:49.90]Alright, let me see if I can get him.
[260:55.85]Oh, I missed completely.
[260:57.39]I hit the wall like 40 feet away.
[261:00.25]Look, I haven't thrown a fucking ball in a long time.
[261:04.01]Mr. Elbertson.
[261:06.33]Yeah?
[261:07.19]Sorry, there was a noise 40 feet away.
[261:09.35]I know, yeah, I tried to do something funny for somebody.
