[01:51.40]You could feel great on a Sunday.
[01:53.66]You could feel great on a Monday.
[01:55.70]Just because there's certain days of the week that you might have off.

[02:53.84]Yeah, add this guy to the list of people that was like a fucking egomaniac and put his name before everything.

[04:58.76]Is that bad?
[05:01.72]Here we go.
[05:02.78]Remember yesterday?
[05:05.14]What was the stream where we had an orchestra singing in the background?
[05:10.91]There it is again.
[05:12.49]Just a different video game.
[05:19.32]Another chorus.
[05:21.38]Sings us in.
[05:22.13]Make sure this is a black screen, I know.
[05:32.57]And... Can you guys see this?
[05:36.47]Because I can't see my other screen.
[05:39.17]I hope you can see.
[05:43.80]It's just Clive Barker singing by himself.
[05:48.93]Yeah, he just like, he opened up like audacity and recorded his voice like 19 times.
[05:54.89]Yeah, let's go.
[05:56.45]You can hear it too, right?
[06:01.96]I hope you can.
[06:03.58]Otherwise, it is medium easy nightmare cancel.

[06:16.53]October 1923.
[06:16.95]DreamWorks Interactive.
[06:17.77]Wow, this is loud.
[06:18.35]Sid Meier's Pirates.
[06:18.97]This guy's way too close to the mic.
[06:19.73]As long as they paid me, I'd look into it.
[06:43.01]Funny thing, though, the more I saw, the more I believe there are forces beyond our control.
[06:48.65]Don't stand next to those barrels.
[06:49.67]Those are explosive barrels.
[06:51.29]In any human terms, things that make my skin crawl.
[06:56.77]I fled from Ireland and hung around Paris and London with no real purpose till the Great War started.
[07:02.80]I joined a special unit whose job it was to squelch the fears of the superstitious farm boys who made up the fighting ranks.
[07:10.12]The Tresanti were the biggest pains.
[07:12.68]He commanded an officer, Jeremiah Covenant, with our unit in the hut for their camp.
[07:17.32]We were ambushed.
[07:18.76]They came streaming out of the woods, waving swords and howling like banshees.
[07:23.60]I saw their leader holding a strange stone over his head, yelling weird words in a strange tongue.
[07:31.15]And just when he was going to pull the trigger, he glared right at me.
[07:35.01]A bright green flash came from his hand, and it bowled me over as my gun went off.
[07:40.36]I woke up in a hospital bed with severe burns.
[07:43.37]They told me Jeremiah had gone on without me, but he'd given me the shaman stone to keep.
[07:51.45]Is it called the Shaming Stone?
[07:52.77]Hold that in front of your friends when they get out of the shower.
[07:55.47]No, wait.
[07:55.73]Don't do that to your friends.
[07:56.65]Don't walk into your friends in the shower.
[07:58.56]The guy's too loud in my ear.
[07:59.74]I'm having trouble talking.
[08:00.40]Alright.
[08:00.62]Hold on a minute.
[08:01.28]I need to... Okay, I got the Shaming Stone.
[08:02.32]We gotta do something here about this.
[08:20.92]The voiceover was a little too high.
[08:23.46]This should be okay now.
[08:26.76]I gotta walk around with the Shaming Stone.
[08:35.19]Is this the Lightning Stone?
[08:36.23]Or is this like Nickelodeon Gak that I have in my hand?
[08:39.21]It's still too loud.
[08:40.09]Hold on.
[08:46.76]Is that gonna be, like, outrageous?
[08:50.23]okay so I took the Nickelodeon gag over to my friend and I shamed him he was too busy watching that old TV show shut the fuck up that is hold up my I'm Patrick gallery I can't even do it slime somebody get here his letter said it was most urgent
[09:17.86]Jeremiah was beginning to think that the letter never arrived in your hands.
[09:21.59]He's been quite anxious to see you.
[09:25.47]We've all been quite worried.
[09:29.78]Jeremiah is now bedridden.
[09:31.84]Follow me and I'll show you to his living quarters.
[09:34.52]Follow me to the house of the undying.
[09:37.38]I promise nothing will happen to you and your dragons.
[09:40.84]Resident Evil 1.
[09:42.54]Another Resident Evil 1 video game.
[09:45.76]And the house is much too large for us to clean.
[09:48.03]Yeah.
[09:50.53]Stole this from Resident Evil 1.
[09:53.07]Every game does it.
[09:54.39]We can only maintain the living quarters.
[10:01.28]Spoilers?
[10:01.76]What are you talking about?
[10:05.36]It's season two.
[10:08.32]Okay, what's the goal here?
[10:11.80]Yeah, make sure I don't click on the bed.
[10:15.81]That'll be a problem.
[10:24.93]Uh, right click turns on... I do like a, your next... gesture.
[10:33.94]Did I just summon this guy?
[10:38.46]I just summoned like Conan O'Brien with a mustache.
[10:43.60]What is happening?
[10:47.60]Turn on sub-touch.
[10:49.22]Is this guy here?
[10:49.74]Is he here?
[10:52.62]Hey.
[10:52.90]Hey!
[10:53.44]I'll drink to that.
[11:00.59]How do I... How do I turn this off?
[11:05.40]I think I... You saw me turn the voiceover down.
[11:10.78]Sorry for the delay, but I've been abroad.
[11:13.31]What happened to you?
[11:15.01]It seems I've come under the watchful eye of the Reaper, my friend.
[11:20.39]It's been a long time, hasn't it?
[11:22.73]Apparently too long.
[11:24.25]Is that a floam around your neck?
[11:26.37]I squish it between my toes one more time.
[11:30.12]My brother Aaron disappeared first, and then my sister Bethany.
[11:34.90]My declining health is a result of an old war wound, and unfortunately, the symptoms are irreversible.
[11:42.28]I didn't summon you here to watch me die.
[11:44.56]I need your help.
[11:45.89]Anything I can do.
[11:46.97]Just name it.
[11:48.27]Strange events began happening around the manor.
[11:51.69]After thinning out my staff, they ransacked my estate, taking whatever they could carry.
[11:58.37]The rest of the help was quick to follow, as they feared rumors of my family's curse.
[12:04.44]I can't help but think it's more than a coincidence that strange happenings have increased since I've been back from the war.
[12:10.90]Very strange family you got here.
[12:12.54]I want to get to the bottom of this, but I'm just too weak to investigate myself.
[12:17.33]Which one is he?
[12:18.21]Is he the guy in the middle?
[12:19.37]I'm relying on you to step in for me.
[12:21.89]Is that a picture of the X-Men or is that his family?
[12:24.21]The only reason I was coming back here is to assist you however I can.
[12:28.45]My thanks to you, Patrick.
[12:30.19]What the hell was that?
[12:31.03]I thought he was just going to... I thought he was going to shoot him.
[12:36.27]I'll check it out.
[12:37.57]Is that gun, like, comically large for him?
[12:42.77]Now I have a gun, okay.
[12:44.93]Jammed.
[12:45.97]Oh, the door will not open, okay.
[12:48.87]Well, the controls are awful.
[12:51.29]So let's go ahead and change these.
[12:53.45]The sensitivity's got to go way down.
[12:56.61]That should be okay.
[12:57.71]Different crosshair?
[12:59.63]Uh, I think I'm a, um... Hmm... Jeez, for how stupid this game is, there sure are a lot of fucking crosshair op- What are these, animals?!
[13:14.00]Okay, I'm gonna go with- I'm gonna go with the deer.
[13:18.53]This has more crosshair options... ...than, like, Counter-Strike.
[13:23.17]Alright, we're gonna go with the deer.
[13:28.81]Why would you okay?
[13:32.75]Use the smiley that deer is gonna get on my nerves won't budge It really is I have to have a yell button look at the lower right oh
[13:41.96]Nice animation.
[13:43.66]Somebody took, like, three days to make that.
[13:45.18]Okay, um... Hold on a minute here.
[13:48.08]Weapon action, alt.
[13:49.26]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[13:59.17]What are these, man?
[14:01.71]Um... No.

[14:05.90]Like, R. No, that's reload.
[14:07.90]Um... T. T.
[14:10.48]Weapon action.
[14:12.14]I'm gonna do, like, middle mouse.
[14:14.06]Or actually, like, yeah, middle mouse is fine for, like, weapon action.
[14:18.81]Up, down.
[14:22.11]Turn left.
[14:22.69]Look up, look down.

[14:58.24]But... God damn it.
[15:02.25]Like, I've already... I've already fucked it all up.
[15:07.29]Where's the screen button?
[15:13.96]I don't see a yell, so I don't know.
[15:17.40]Oh, these are just one, two, three, four.
[15:18.91]Use an inventory is enter.
[15:22.27]Next in inventory is up.
[15:23.71]Okay, mouse wheel up and mouse wheel down.

[15:35.66]Spellfire is right mouse.
[15:37.66]I think we're good.
[15:40.68]Okay, so.

[15:43.03]That's Sneak.
[15:46.27]I'm ready to play Clive Barker.
[15:47.91]Stuck.
[15:49.59]Jericho.
[15:52.23]So to stop hitting right click.
[15:54.75]Right click is not going to do anything for me.
[15:56.03]I knew it.
[15:56.31]There's going to be a guy...
[15:59.03]That would have just scared me, but he closed the door on me.
[16:02.21]That was me.
[16:06.15]Oh, there he is.
[16:06.65]Our next guest is going to be Kit Harington, Jon Snow.
[16:15.17]Give me a plus one for that one, come on.
[16:25.74]I guess I have to follow him.
[16:31.03]There is a friendly dog.
[16:32.29]I don't know.
[16:33.15]Is there a friendly dog?
[16:34.05]He actually sounds like Conan O'Brien.
[16:42.28]They gave him a Conan voice too.
[16:44.26]Alright.
[16:44.70]Picked up some bullets.
[17:06.99]Uh, that was just for him to tell me that.
[17:08.72]Now I walk out here.
[17:09.46]Do I have, like, a flashlight or anything?
[17:14.76]Oh, God.
[17:15.28]I can't get this off the screen.
[17:19.32]Stuck.
[17:22.88]Here's a new room.
[17:23.84]Is it going to show up again?
[17:24.56]That's a health pack.
[17:30.91]Is this a horror game?
[17:32.01]Uh, it's supposed to be.
[17:39.63]Whoa!
[17:40.09]He got me!
[17:44.19]Oh, I didn't even do it in the mirror.
[17:45.49]That's bullshit.
[17:53.52]Didn't even pull up his other hand.
[17:56.94]Oh, I heard a scream.
[17:57.72]That means... Uh-oh.
[18:01.18]Our first encounter.
[18:02.02]Alright, does the green mean I shouldn't...
[18:08.44]I thought the green was gonna be like, don't shoot, because green means that's a friendly.
[18:16.14]Alright, headshots do work.
[18:17.94]It's good to know.
[18:18.52]Uh, it's health.
[18:28.09]I gained a health pack.
[18:29.05]Not like the other game.
[18:37.37]Alright, I got him in the shin, then I got him in the shoulder.
[18:39.21]We're doing well.
[18:49.87]Come on.
[18:52.15]What are you... It's like knocking me up the stairs.
[18:57.43]How do I use a health pack?
[18:59.51]No, that's like the fucking developer console.
[19:02.37]Hold on.
[19:03.21]Alright, health.
[19:05.64]I want to use the health.
[19:06.46]There we go.
[19:15.14]Heals a lot.
[19:21.60]Stuck.
[19:22.94]Back out here.
[19:23.44]I probably have to go up top.
[19:27.16]Won't budge.
[19:27.94]Use the plus key.
[19:31.58]So Clive Barker...
[19:34.94]Undying we got let's get a headshot here.
[19:37.50]No, I can't even too far away now.
[19:41.45]I'm close Still got it still got it.
[19:49.27]He's dead Journal entry like who cares?
[19:59.68]Where's the scary stuff?
[20:04.32]Alright, the fives aren't backwards.
[20:05.56]Yeah, I feel like we're just playing a much worse version of Nosferatu.
[20:08.70]Do I have to save my family?
[20:14.06]Is that the goal?
[20:15.50]To rescue family.
[20:19.95]Here comes a cutscene.
[20:20.55]This is gonna be good.
[20:22.25]Wait, what?
[20:22.99]Those beasts were after me.
[20:24.73]What in God's name were those things?
[20:27.15]They're called howlers.
[20:29.05]And while I've never seen one before tonight, I've heard them for years.
[20:34.05]Those weren't natural, my friend.
[20:36.21]We're fighting more than superstitions here.
[20:38.79]Perhaps I was being naive not to tell you, but there might be something more sinister at work here.
[20:45.98]When I was aboard, I encountered something I can't quite explain.
[20:49.84]Worst version, I don't remember Nosferatu having his deer crosshair.
[20:51.96]You see there in this island, standing stones that sits just off the estate.
[20:55.95]Someone had carved a sigil into each of the stones.
[20:59.13]Something indiscernible.
[21:01.05]Father had many books on the occult, one of which contained a sketch of that very symbol.
[21:06.87]Was this a book?
[21:07.73]I took my brothers and sisters out to the island and read from my father's book.
[21:13.06]No?
[21:13.30]Ah, my hand.
[21:30.50]Patrick, I know it sounds like the ravings of a dying man, but I believe those standing stones had something to do with this.
[21:38.63]What has once been a taint upon this family has now begun to manifest itself.
[21:42.81]When we get to the point where I don't want to play anymore, I'm going to read the last four sentences of this book.
[21:52.46]I've heard some servants whispering.
[21:54.80]They think they've seen Lisbeth on the estate.
[21:56.81]I'm going to read the last paragraphs of the book outline.
[21:59.93]I sense them, Patrick.
[22:01.53]By now, you and I know the supernatural exists.
[22:05.47]You saw the Howlers.
[22:07.21]And what about our encounters with the Tersanti during the war?
[22:10.68]Take this treasure map.
[22:11.56]You still even carry the Gelzibar stone with you.
[22:14.02]It's a token of the Shaman's life I took.
[22:15.96]I thought he was gonna say toy.
[22:17.10]It's a toy.
[22:17.68]That is a toy.
[22:18.34]I found a scroll with a picture of the Gelsabar on it.
[22:20.87]No, it's not what you think it is.
[22:21.77]It's actually just a children's toy.
[22:27.64]Very well.
[22:28.86]Let me study this scroll overnight, and I'll see what I can do in the morning.
[22:33.57]This house still hides many secrets.
[22:37.35]I'm counting on you to reveal them and put an end to this mess.
[22:41.59]My favorite thing about old games is this guy that clearly like painted Vaughn's face with the mouth that moves up and down.
[22:48.44]The eyes are just... Okay, what Mega Man power did I just get?
[22:56.52]Oh, nice.
[22:57.18]Now I can like shoot needles out of my hand that travel in a homing arc.
[23:02.68]I'm glad.
[23:07.03]I picked up some ectoplasm.
[23:08.15]Alright, let's go.
[23:16.89]Another cutscene?
[23:17.89]No.
[23:20.67]That's just like the fucking Kentucky Fried Chicken guy.
[23:24.08]Here we go.
[23:30.83]Have you noticed anything strange going on?
[23:34.59]BioShock Infinite.
[23:35.91]Is a coin a coin?
[23:39.03]Uh, what side of the coin?
[23:41.09]Heads?
[23:41.65]No tails.
[23:42.67]Heads?
[23:43.27]No tails.
[23:49.04]How's that, BioShock?
[23:52.50]We got infinite endings, huh?
[23:54.90]I don't think I was supposed to do that.
[24:03.88]I actually have to follow this guy.
[24:05.54]The bird of the cage.
[24:07.68]The bird of the cage.
[24:09.16]Okay, don't shoot him.
[24:10.26]Don't shoot the guy.
[24:12.94]This is just the butler.
[24:14.41]He's walking very fast.
[24:32.13]Watch, he's going to turn into a ghoul and I'm going to have to kill him anyways.
[24:35.87]Alright, here's what I want you guys to do.
[24:39.77]I want somebody to read one chapter ahead of where I am in the book and tell me what's going to happen next.
[24:45.85]Tell me what you know about Lisbeth.
[24:48.72]White.
[24:52.04]Okay, that's what happens when you're a trigger-happy idiot.
[24:56.34]I just tried to do it and I missed.
[25:02.38]How do I save the game?
[25:03.26]Oh, I thought I just did that.
[25:08.01]Alright.
[25:11.25]What did you say?
[25:14.47]Elizabeth.
[25:16.59]What were the name of these two people?
[25:17.71]It was like the... It was like the Jericho twins.
[25:21.28]The, uh... It was the Clark... It was the Parker twins.
[25:26.54]Are you painting?
[25:29.32]Jesus Christ, man!
[25:34.62]Alright, that was the scariest thing so far.
[25:36.34]So, what exactly am I supposed to be doing?
[25:50.03]Health pack.
[25:53.67]Okay, I'm just going to assume I just have to leave.
[26:01.79]This is all knocked down.
[26:02.65]Okay, that's kind of creepy.
[26:07.78]Get out of here.
[26:10.56]I wish I didn't skip her dialog.
[26:16.38]I'm coming!
[26:19.23]I'm coming!
[26:22.89]Alright, there's one.
[26:34.26]Alright, there's two.
[26:36.60]So where did she go?
[26:40.63]Oh, shit.
[26:42.87]Wow, okay, so the portrait changes if you're in the weird ghost mode.
[26:51.58]Interesting.
[26:52.02]Alright, now that's interesting.
[26:54.30]Let's go, what about this one?
[26:56.34]Is she dead?
[27:03.89]We found the one fairly interesting thing so far.
[27:09.06]This is a different spell.
[27:12.90]I just got teeth from Diablo II.
[27:14.68]Nice.
[27:15.96]I think I would rather have that.
[27:22.55]I need a key.
[27:23.63]I need Bethany's room key.
[27:27.57]Does Bethany have the key on her body on the ground?
[27:31.79]Because, like, she's dead in here, right?
[27:34.47]Alright, Bethany, where's your key?
[27:38.56]Apparently, no.
[27:40.10]Oh.
[27:40.62]Well, that's convenient, I guess.
[27:43.90]Not really, because it's kind of hard to navigate that.
[27:49.66]Um.
[27:49.78]Alright, well, we're going over here.
[27:54.59]Through these.
[27:55.81]No.
[27:56.43]Jumped.
[27:57.31]Of course it is.
[28:01.61]Of course it is!
[28:08.56]What about- is the professor still in here?
[28:12.20]Why do I always assume that a guy with the glasses and a gray mustache is a professor in every single game that I play?
[28:18.88]I need to read the journal entries.
[28:21.72]How the hell do I get to the journal entries?
[28:25.38]All I have is bullets and health.
[28:27.49]Shit.
[28:34.50]B, N, M, L, K. I'll get it eventually.
[28:40.67]That's spell list.
[28:42.77]I have the paper down there that I can't look at.
[28:49.69]Let's look it up.
[28:54.51]Spell, fire, weapon, fire, strafe, look.
[29:00.04]Sneak.
[29:01.28]Use it in inventory as left bracket or mouse wheel.
[29:06.39]S. It's F3.
[29:08.97]Don't tell me that shit.
[29:10.61]That's not gonna work.
[29:19.60]S is backwards.
[29:22.20]This is a really spooky stream.
[29:23.92]It's very well it's gonna be.
[29:25.58]What do you mean laugh at the nerd?
[29:27.10]What are you talking about?
[29:32.99]I'm not laughing at anybody.
[29:34.25]I'm just stating that I for some reason call the guy that goes like, the older male.
[29:42.82]I need the study key.
[29:44.26]No more keys.
[29:49.18]The guy that's always sitting down and talking.
[29:56.06]Oh, at least you can break the glass.
[30:00.57]Um... I didn't... I went in here already.
[30:02.77]Nothing in the bathroom.
[30:07.82]What are you laughing at?
[30:09.08]Who's... Stop laughing!
[30:13.04]It's F7?
[30:18.56]Um... Website.
[30:21.52]Let's go to their website.
[30:26.37]F7 is quick load.
[30:30.60]Why is the cursor a horse?
[30:34.15]For people that are just coming in here, that probably does look very odd.
[30:42.75]Go back to the spooky guy.
[30:43.97]I know, where's Conan O'Brien?
[30:46.03]There we go.
[30:46.41]At least it has realistic loading screens.
[30:57.08]Gun loading.
[30:57.68]I need to start using teeth.
[31:04.17]Quick load.
[31:05.93]There he is.
[31:07.05]Did I shoot him accidentally?
[31:11.07]Let's quick save.
[31:12.26]F5.
[31:16.14]Save.
[31:20.94]Are you sure?
[31:21.66]Hey, look.
[31:27.41]He did the funny joke where he shot the guy.
[31:30.07]Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[31:33.14]He did it.
[31:33.86]He saw it happen.
[31:36.73]He did the shoot the guy joke.
[31:39.31]It was hilarious.
[31:44.25]I hear a dog.
[31:49.85]Look around.
[31:58.04]Why do I have to be this like... This really is a Sid Meier's pirate.
[32:02.85]And it's freaking me out because the way that my hand is moving is not matching up.
[32:06.25]It's not corresponding with his at all.
[32:10.28]This is clearly... There's two people in this room.
[32:12.42]I don't know which one's the ghost.
[32:16.98]Okay, there's another note.
[32:18.56]New journal entry that I don't know how to read.
[32:25.19]Down to the bed?
[32:25.85]What do you want me to look?
[32:32.84]Save the dog and then kill it.
[32:39.37]I was like... Just hold on.
[32:45.13]I'm gonna die here.
[32:47.97]No, I'm not.
[32:53.24]This game's not even scary.
[32:55.34]What the fuck?
[32:56.14]Get out of here.
[33:00.96]Hell.
[33:03.70]You took a dog pack.
[33:07.30]It makes a dog noise.
[33:10.87]Take it again.
[33:17.27]Pretty good death animations.
[33:18.39]I know, really.
[33:21.89]I know you want me to look around.
[33:23.07]I know there's a dog that I'm going to save.
[33:25.20]This really is just the other game.
[33:31.78]Wait a minute.
[33:36.06]Is this going to be some Snow White shit?
[33:39.66]Hold on, wait.
[33:42.93]How do I change my spell?
[33:46.35]What's the spell change button?
[33:52.34]How did I get there?
[33:54.84]I fucking forget.
[33:55.54]No.
[33:56.32]What is the spell button?
[33:58.22]Let's not be...
[34:00.21]It's like holding a certain mouse button down.
[34:14.71]I pressed like every button.
[34:16.07]What is it?
[34:16.49]I don't even know.
[34:17.51]I have no idea.
[34:20.22]It's three and four.
[34:21.86]Okay.
[34:31.94]Oh, there's blood on the bed.
[34:32.76]Am I supposed to follow the blood trail?
[34:39.97]Look around you.
[34:47.62]Why do you have a baby's belt?
[34:50.14]Nah, I have a baby crying ability.
[35:00.89]That's just me crying.
[35:02.05]That's my character.
[35:03.47]He's too scared.
[35:12.19]Here's the game manual.
[35:18.32]Wait, hold on.
[35:18.94]Oh, come on.
[35:24.06]Where's this dog that keeps making noise?
[35:28.10]Wait, footprints!
[35:31.78]Are those my footprints?
[35:37.22]Where's this crying baby?
[35:43.20]There's nothing I can do about this.
[35:44.31]Why is your crosshair a moose?
[35:54.21]I don't know.
[35:54.67]Okay, um...
[36:01.84]Wait, not next yet.
[36:03.28]Not quite.
[36:04.72]We're almost at a potential next.
[36:08.13]We just have to find the dog first.
[36:14.91]Alexa, stop crying.
[36:18.17]Dog?
[36:23.61]Dog?
[36:33.49]Now they actually did turn into the X-Men.
[36:36.79]Yeah.
[36:38.59]Look at that.
[36:39.73]Look at... Look at... I'm not even kidding.
[36:41.26]That was just... They just... See, this is their alter egos.
[36:45.03]And then you, they, here you go.
[36:46.65]There's, um, the red guy that's, uh, Nightcrawler's dad.
[36:51.77]There's Jean Gray Phoenix.
[36:54.45]Professor X, like, dies in the third X-Men or something, so, like, that makes sense.
[36:59.20]Then over here you have, uh, White Witch and, uh, Tatanka.
[37:06.42]There are your X-Men, ladies and gentlemen.
[37:13.92]Oh, no!
[37:16.20]Oh, look out behind you!
[37:18.36]Oh, come on, really?
[37:28.90]Oh, it is Halloween.
[37:29.64]Can you hear the funny goblins going like...
[37:40.30]Is there a headless X-Men?
[37:42.32]Oh, there's the horse making the noise.
[37:48.96]What am I looking at here?
[37:52.33]Am I going to press F3 once this stream?
[37:59.53]I'm having more fun looking at the paintings.
[38:04.88]Locked.
[38:06.08]I guess I have to keep following here.
[38:10.49]Is there a Headless Axeman?
[38:11.57]There might be.
[38:12.09]I so badly want to find this dog.
[38:26.38]I keep hearing about this dog, and I need to find it.
[38:30.40]Get that.
[38:32.76]Uh-huh.
[38:33.70]Head through here.

[39:19.27]Alright, let's play a game.
[39:21.05]Let's play a game called... What is the streamer going to do in this situation?
[39:26.11]He's saved right before he goes and fights like the fat lunch lady.
[39:30.96]Place your bets.
[39:31.50]What's the streamer gonna do in like the weird steam room?
[39:37.82]Is that the door to the gardens?
[39:40.20]Yes, it is.
[39:41.28]However, I don't have the key.
[39:43.24]I lent it to the maid.
[39:45.06]I believe she is cleaning Herr Keisinger's room today.
[39:48.36]It's located in the east wing of the house.
[39:54.19]Thanks.
[39:55.21]I appreciate your help.
[40:00.89]Next time on What's the Funny Streamer Gonna Do?
[40:09.66]He's going to let her walk by.
[40:24.53]Burner.
[40:25.39]I have the east key now.
[40:26.67]I'm not going to do the predictable thing that you guys think I'm going to do.
[40:34.13]I'm going to be unpredictable this stream.
[40:36.05]I want to make sure of that.
[40:39.89]Absolutely no predictability.
[40:42.81]I could do anything.
[40:46.05]You know what I'm saying?
[40:54.21]Hey, hide and seek.
[40:56.05]I found you.
[40:56.85]It's your turn to be the guy that seeks now.
[40:59.70]I want to find a better hiding spot.
[41:03.92]I'm going to count to ten.
[41:05.00]Here we go.
[41:17.71]Okay, I can actually shoot that lady.
[41:20.57]What?
[41:27.41]Oh fuck.
[41:29.73]I have one bullet.
[41:31.98]Good thing I made it count.
[41:36.62]Health.
[41:38.92]I would love to select the health.
[41:43.91]Demon goblin.
[41:46.73]Alright, let's go.
[41:47.23]Alright, let's just make... Let's get to, like, inside the east area.
[41:52.94]And then we'll... We'll go from there.
[41:56.12]We do have a lot to get through.
[41:57.84]So, I can't hit this guy.
[42:18.67]Where is it?
[42:19.79]I know it is around here someplace.
[42:26.39]What do you need?
[42:31.57]He's going to drop something on the ground that I can pick up?
[42:33.09]Ah, here it is.
[42:35.92]I'm going to drop it, and I'm going to get it.
[42:38.90]And we're talking with a very unenthusiastic voice right now.
[42:44.02]It's okay.
[42:50.71]I can't, like, knock it out of his hands?
[42:54.05]Oh, you dick.
[42:54.77]He put it in a place where you know I can't get it.
[43:02.10]Okay.
[43:04.30]So, I think I'm going to go over here.
[43:09.10]This looks like the best place to go.
[43:13.44]No, that door don't open.
[43:16.03]Okay.
[43:22.55]I'm sure the book doesn't seem to do anything.
[43:26.33]Oh.
[43:27.27]Yeah, of course it does.
[43:30.03]How long should I put that on for before people come into this room and then immediately want to, like, leave?
[43:34.59]Because I'm just, like, just boring.
[43:37.59]Right.
[43:40.86]There we go.
[43:42.70]Alright.
[43:43.24]Speaking of, like, reaching, like, let's go.
[43:47.13]You thought it was gibberish?
[43:48.01]No, I was talking.
[43:49.19]Hold on, we gotta look through our, like, kaleidoscope.
[43:52.38]Oh, no, this is too bad.
[43:53.30]These are just, like, real pictures.
[43:55.76]I want, like, fake scary horror game pictures.
[44:00.78]I want somebody to jump out of the screen.
[44:03.45]Not like that.
[44:05.67]That wasn't good enough.
[44:07.07]Not like that either.
[44:08.89]You can do better than that.
[44:12.27]What's the right door?
[44:13.09]I don't know what the hell.
[44:16.09]Okay, man.
[44:17.37]Whatever you say.

[50:19.07]This is the creepy boss door.
[50:32.57]This is like the first area where you're going to be concerned about.
[50:38.25]Yeah, you know what?
[50:38.69]It might be my Sonic hearing.
[50:40.22]You're right.
[50:40.58]This doesn't find the dog.
[50:46.68]Wherever the hell the dog ends up being.
[50:48.28]Who knows?
[50:48.68]What is that?
[50:58.69]Well, that's how you get this.
[51:00.91]You gained an amplifier.
[51:01.75]Amplifier.
[51:08.35]No, that doesn't do anything.
[51:12.75]I feel like I'm not utilizing the stone in its current, what it was currently intended.
[51:17.49]Yeah, I've got a hearing amplifier.
[51:22.42]Oh my god.
[51:24.48]Sonic hearing.
[51:32.43]Alright.
[51:32.67]We're going to move on to the next game.
[51:35.22]This was a small amount of little bit of laughs in this one.
[51:39.98]This was scary.
[51:40.90]Now you can hear jokes from across the room.
[51:43.56]Alright.
[51:44.46]Give me a second.
[51:48.20]Next game.
[51:49.38]That was Clive Barker's
[51:52.40]That was Clive Barker's Nickelodeon Floam.
[51:55.59]We're going to the next one.
[51:57.48]Oh God, the next one might be worse.
