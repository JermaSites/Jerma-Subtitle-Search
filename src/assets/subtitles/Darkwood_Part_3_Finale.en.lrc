[00:00.92]Hello.
[00:03.26]It's muted.
[00:03.78]Yeah, I was cleaning a few things up.
[00:06.78]I was taking care of a few things.
[00:10.00]How we doing?
[00:15.85]Welcome back.
[00:18.71]To another stream.
[00:19.37]Tonight we're going to do more Darkwood.
[00:24.36]And hopefully get somewhere close to the end.
[00:29.70]If we don't get close to the end, then... Gonna have to do it a different day!
[00:35.56]Gonna have to finish it at some point when I come back after the weekend here.
[00:41.52]But!
[00:42.98]Before we do any of that, before we talk about Darkwood... Or even play Darkwood... We have something to talk about.
[00:53.91]What's wrong?
[00:54.55]I'm just gonna wait until people come in.
[00:56.05]Because I have a small announcement to make.
[01:02.89]Triplets!
[01:04.77]We're gonna have triplets!
[01:07.97]Just kidding.
[01:10.55]So... There is... There is gonna be... A Halloween stream this year.
[01:23.19]And the Halloween stream is going to be... A fairly elaborate one.
[01:29.98]But hold on.
[01:31.52]I need to wait, because there's a lot to this that needs some explaining.
[01:41.23]Let me just wait until people trickle in.
[01:44.95]I'm excited.
[01:47.41]I am excited, because this is going to be a shitshow.
[01:54.76]Here comes the Bugleberry Takeover.
[01:56.30]Somebody actually mentioned this yesterday.
[01:59.30]And it was so hard to not say anything.
[02:04.89]You know how difficult it is?
[02:06.09]I cannot... Don't ever tell me a secret, first of all.
[02:10.03]If you ever... Hey, man, I gotta tell you a secret.
[02:12.85]Oh, Jerry?
[02:14.29]Oh my god, he was like so annoying today.
[02:17.04]I'm gonna tell Jerry immediately.
[02:21.12]Like within 10 minutes.
[02:22.94]We're gonna be like, bye, you're gonna be walking away, and even Jerry's gonna walk by.
[02:26.68]Jerry, I got to tell you something, Jerry.
[02:29.66]Don't ever tell me a secret.
[02:34.07]He's just a snitch.
[02:35.73]No, no, no, no, that's a really bad example.
[02:38.87]That's a terrible example.
[02:40.01]No, if somebody told me, like, a secret, something in confidence, I would not tell anybody if they didn't want me to.
[02:46.21]I'm just saying, like, I'm, it's hard for me to sit on information.
[02:55.21]Jerry trusted you.
[02:56.39]No, it wasn't Jerry that trusted me.
[02:57.73]It was somebody else.
[03:00.35]No, no, no.
[03:00.75]Let's put it... No, no, no.
[03:01.73]Hold on.
[03:02.81]Let me rephrase that.
[03:04.49]If you told me... Hey, I want to... We're planning Jerry's surprise birthday party for next weekend.
[03:11.85]Oh, it's just going to be three clowns.
[03:13.45]We're going to have a tractor.
[03:14.98]There's going to be like a fire engine's going to come and honk the horn.
[03:17.84]I'm going to be like, holy shit, that's awesome.
[03:20.66]I'm going to see Jerry the next day, and I'm going to accidentally be like, we'll be talking about anything.
[03:26.32]And I will slip up and say, oh, dude, like, that's such a bright red.
[03:30.65]Oh, that's such a beautiful bright red.
[03:32.39]You're right on that painting.
[03:33.93]Just like the fire truck that's going to be there next weekend.
[03:37.19]That's what it is.
[03:38.63]Yeah, I corrected it.
[03:39.35]That's better.
[03:43.36]So I'm not like a, I don't like, I'm not going to like, somebody tell me something in confidence.
[03:48.86]Well, that would be in confidence too.
[03:51.43]But anyways, so this stream is going to be on maybe Halloween, maybe a day before.
[03:57.74]Maybe a couple days.
[03:58.40]It depends.
[03:58.98]We have to lock in the dates here.
[04:01.20]But we're going to do a secret slime action stream.
[04:06.86]What is this?
[04:10.19]What are you guys linking me?
[04:13.19]Robotic Sideshow.
[04:14.89]Jay Elbertson's Robotic Sideshow?
[04:17.99]What?
[04:19.35]What?
[04:24.10]No, is this in the game?
[04:27.54]Wait, what?
[04:31.16]No, it's not.
[04:34.48]Holy shit.
[04:35.48]Okay, that's awesome.
[04:37.92]Really?
[04:39.26]Oh, that's awesome.
[04:42.22]It's a new community map in the... Oh, wow.
[04:51.82]That's so cool.
[04:53.04]I am... I'm like floor... I don't even know what to say.
[04:55.99]That's so cool.
[05:00.97]I thought this was like somebody just made a... Like a Photoshop or something.
[05:04.41]That's... That's awesome.
[05:06.53]There's a Vinesauce stuff in there too.
[05:08.87]That's awesome.
[05:10.56]I'm gonna have to check that out.
[05:15.10]He's gonna cry.
[05:16.64]That's so cute.
[05:17.32]Yeah, I'll show it on screen.
[05:19.80]That's really cool.
[05:21.60]But anyways, yeah, that's... I got all kinds of emotions going on right now.
[05:26.31]There's like four different emotions.
[05:30.39]I'm excited.
[05:31.11]I'm happy.
[05:31.77]I'm like humbled.
[05:33.01]I'm surprised.
[05:34.55]I got all of it.
[05:36.11]The whole cast of Inside Out is in here right now.
[05:41.03]And they're all talking at the same time.
[05:43.03]Except for the anger.
[05:44.49]The anger is on lunch.
[05:46.00]And fear is on lunch.
[05:47.56]So only like four, like three of them.
[05:50.80]I don't know.
[05:51.08]I've never even seen it.
[05:52.72]I don't know what that plot of that movie is.
[05:54.28]I've never seen it.
[05:55.80]I just know that there's like emotions that all hang out in somebody's body.
[05:59.14]I've never seen it.
[06:00.84]But, besides that, which is awesome, we are going to be doing on Halloween a secret slime action stream.
[06:11.75]What does that mean?
[06:12.95]Well, it's taken about three or four days to scramble to get this done, but I have to do it.
[06:19.86]Over the next few weeks, the next two weeks or so, not now, but this weekend, probably Sunday or into Monday, there's going to be a couple of new channels in the Discord.
[06:30.97]In those channels, what you are going to do is you are going to come up with
[06:37.62]One channel will be for discussion.
[06:39.49]So you can talk about it.
[06:40.69]What should we do?
[06:41.93]What should we try to see?
[06:42.95]What he'll do?
[06:44.61]Discussing actions that I am going to be doing on stream without my knowledge.
[06:51.56]Just like those old Nickelodeon shows.
[06:54.38]So, for instance, I'll give you an example.
[06:56.82]Scratching your nose.
[06:59.61]That's gonna be one of the actions, possibly.
[07:02.09]And if I do the actions that you guys come up with during the course of probably 10 rounds, I get slimed.
[07:09.49]With real slime.
[07:11.03]Sitting at a computer.
[07:14.17]Now, that's all fun and dandy, but what about you?
[07:19.63]See, you also are going to have actions that you cannot say or do.
[07:25.32]And if you do them, then you're gone during the course of that stream.
[07:30.15]So I get to come up with it too.
[07:34.72]So each round, there will be maybe one or two actions that we both cannot do.
[07:39.60]There will be a bot.
[07:41.22]There will be... It's time for slime.
[07:42.48]Thanks to the five community subs.
[07:43.52]Right on time.
[07:50.15]So your goal... Well, the goal here is, let's say... I'm going to try to explain this piece by piece because it takes a lot of explanation for it to understand even what the hell this is.
[07:59.21]I am gonna start with a certain amount of points.
[08:02.08]And we're gonna do it by rounds, and each round is gonna have a timer on it.
[08:05.78]So, after 15 minutes or so, that'll be the end of round one.
[08:09.30]And however many people did the thing in chat that was the secret chat slime action, those people are out of the game.
[08:18.23]I'm not gonna make this easy for you.
[08:21.09]It's gonna be very, very, very hard for you not to talk about stuff.
[08:27.90]Just don't chat?
[08:29.50]That's fine.
[08:30.94]But we're going to have a program that is going to be created to track who is participating in the games.
[08:38.28]You're not going to get permabanned.
[08:43.82]Why would you get permabanned?
[08:47.96]This is going to be a lot of fun.
[08:49.60]And that's just part one.
[08:51.84]I think my computer crashed.
[08:57.00]No, it's fine.
[08:58.99]There are going to be three separate activities that happen on this stream.
[09:03.29]That's part one.
[09:06.72]There's a part two and a part three that I don't really want to talk to you about.
[09:11.44]Because that would kind of spoil it, essentially.
[09:14.51]Not yet.
[09:22.23]B.F. Bugleberry, please.
[09:23.91]I mean, that's the most hated character in the whole entire universe, this whole channel.
[09:28.60]I don't think that Bugleberry will make an appearance.
[09:30.72]I mean, why would they?
[09:39.43]But, there's going to be more... I just want to really bring it up briefly, because I don't want to overwhelm everybody yet.
[09:45.65]But, there's going to be a Halloween stream, secret slime actions.
[09:49.29]You're going to be directly competing against me...
[09:52.49]to not do the thing that you and I have come up with over a series of ten rounds.
[09:59.56]If I get slimed, I lose points.
[10:01.86]Each person in chat is worth one point.
[10:04.72]So if you get eliminated, that's minus one point for all of you working together on this.
[10:16.67]There's no such thing as minus one.
[10:18.27]Well, there is now.
[10:20.36]You're gonna lose.
[10:21.46]I don't know.
[10:21.76]It depends.
[10:22.72]It depends on what you guys can come up with for actions.
[10:24.44]And they could be anything.
[10:26.30]But make them good.
[10:28.94]We'll talk more about this at the end of the stream.
[10:33.34]I don't want to overwhelm you.
[10:38.81]Breathing.
[10:39.35]And no, it can't be anything like that.
[10:43.31]Stuff that is required to survive is not a secret slime action.
[10:49.01]Breathing...
[10:51.59]Like, air going in and out of your nose is not a thing that can slime me.
[10:55.31]Drinking water... I mean... Okay, what if going to the bathroom is one of them, and I get slimed in the bathroom?
[11:13.34]That's fucking so stupid.
[11:17.03]But we'll come up with some stuff.
[11:18.87]I want to give it to you now.
[11:20.67]So you can start to preliminary think about it in your brain.
[11:24.75]And those of you that have never seen any of the old Nickelodeon shows where they used to do weird shit like this... I'm gonna try to not do the things that you are.
[11:33.54]Because remember, I don't know... I'm not gonna know what you guys are suggesting.
[11:38.76]The people running the show have all that information.
[11:41.82]So I don't know... Oh, hey, by the way, don't, uh... Don't sneeze this round!
[11:47.61]I don't know what is potentially picked.
[11:50.43]But it just comes from a pool of things that you guys have suggested.
[11:55.95]Also... I want to talk about this, too.
[11:58.93]This is a Talk About Stuff stream.
[12:01.38]Uh, a week or two after that... I'm going back in front of the green screen.
[12:05.74]We're gonna do green screen DLC for free.
[12:08.94]This is gonna be the name of that stream.
[12:19.12]We're gonna do a whole nother thing where we take in more of your suggestions for actions over the course of a couple weeks.
[12:26.79]And I'm going back in front and we're gonna give you guys more material.
[12:30.57]Because it makes me laugh every time.
[12:37.12]So... I don't want to throw this all at you at once.
[12:44.00]But that stuff is happening.
[12:48.05]He's stalling the stream.
[12:48.89]He hates Darkwood.
[12:53.40]Happy Halloween!
[12:55.96]From this company.
[12:58.40]It's a spider.
[13:02.59]Alright, for a second I thought that was coffee.
[13:04.51]And I was about to gag.
[13:06.51]It's lemon water.
[13:07.41]I don't know why I thought it was an iced coffee.
[13:15.05]So, we're in Darkwood.
[13:15.93]We're going to continue.
[13:16.61]We're going to play Darkwood.
[13:17.51]I'm going to try to finish Darkwood.
[13:19.53]I might.
[13:20.05]I don't know.
[13:20.45]Is it going to be tough to get to the end of this?
[13:21.89]We'll see.
[13:23.42]We're on day 19.
[13:25.90]We will find out if I can do it or not.
[13:28.98]This might be a situation where I play for like six hours and go, we'll finish it later.
[13:33.56]Or I might just Simpsons hit and run, sit here until it's done.
[13:37.62]I don't know.
[13:45.73]But, uh, we left off.
[13:49.32]I'm so fucking excited for this stream.
[13:52.54]I can't wait for the secret slime Halloween stream.
[13:59.49]You have an exam in seven hours?
[14:00.65]I have to sleep.
[14:01.25]Well, I'll try to get it done in seven hours.
[14:03.17]I'll get it done in five.
[14:07.85]And there are people that are going to be coming into the stream.
[14:09.63]That's why I didn't want to throw it all out at the beginning and just... It's an overwhelming amount of information that I think is better to, like, read in a Discord.
[14:17.12]Because I'm going to write up a whole thing for you guys to, like, read in the pinned channel there.
[14:21.34]There'll be two channels.
[14:22.60]One of them will be for discussions on things that you want me to... Not that you want me to do.
[14:27.66]Things that you think I will do that I don't know.
[14:32.65]and one for, obviously, a single sentence of what that thing is.
[14:40.06]We'll talk about it again at the end of the stream.
[14:43.94]So, the last thing I remember is we organized the workbench.
[14:53.70]Don't put him in here!
[14:54.78]I don't want to see him!
[14:56.49]Are you trying to win this competition or you want me to be prepared for when it happens?
[15:02.30]And some of these rounds, by the way, once we get to round 5, 6, 7, 8, there might be multiple actions.
[15:09.45]There might be three or four things on the screen that I can't do.
[15:11.59]We're going to make it hard.
[15:13.53]And you too.
[15:14.97]Don't get banned.
[15:23.20]Blinking.
[15:23.62]No, that's a human survival reaction.
[15:26.16]That doesn't count.
[15:28.24]Alright, so.
[15:29.80]The last thing I was going to do...
[15:32.41]was that the wolf the wolf told me hey you got to go up here now because here's the hideout up here and there's a there's a spot here that I'm going to go up and I'm going to just get to the hideout new hideout incoming look look look look look you guys are on like alright cool I guess
[16:05.39]Anyways.
[16:05.73]Uh, what do I have?
[16:07.51]I have... I need some new armor.
[16:09.63]I gotta kill a bug.
[16:10.38]I also have... I need to take some stuff with me because this is the journey to go to the next hideout.
[16:18.76]I need a couple of things.
[16:19.60]Gas.
[16:21.64]I'm gonna bring some wood.
[16:23.34]And I'm gonna bring a bunch of nails.
[16:27.02]What else do I want to bring with me to survive this place?
[16:31.66]To have an... Okay.
[16:33.32]The bandages.
[16:38.43]I need alcohol.
[16:40.31]Alright.
[16:41.84]This goal is just to get to the hideout, the new hideout.
[16:45.76]I think everything else is fine.
[16:46.98]What about batteries?
[16:48.78]Yeah, I'll take a couple of batteries.
[16:50.06]A couple things of gas.
[16:53.60]Get this bottle out of here.
[16:59.07]Scrap metal.
[17:00.29]Let me take that too.
[17:02.99]Alright.
[17:05.91]I'm ready to get out of here and try to get to the next hideout.
[17:14.14]Jerma's current score is minus 46.
[17:16.30]That doesn't count.
[17:16.82]People did minus 1 like 100 times.
[17:21.38]How do I already have minus 46?
[17:23.25]No, I'm serious.
[17:24.47]How do I already have minus 46?
[17:25.99]I haven't done anything.
[17:28.13]I haven't said anything.
[17:29.19]I talked about like... What is this, Reddit?
[17:33.30]Reddit?
[17:40.58]Okay, here.
[17:42.04]Game's a little low, turn left a little.
[17:46.93]Alright, looks good.
[17:47.75]I'm going.
[17:48.07]Uh, so, uh, the fastest route is to go all the way up.
[17:54.39]Left and up.
[17:57.25]I have bandages.
[17:58.01]Let me put those bandages... And I got pills, too.
[18:00.87]And I got lockpicks.
[18:01.91]I'm ready.
[18:03.63]Let's put the... No.
[18:05.09]The pills.
[18:06.11]No.
[18:06.25]No.
[18:07.62]bandages okay go for it time to go to a new hideout and do the uh this third little zone up here because that's where I need to go you forgot the bell wow I almost just ruined this whole place I almost just just forgot those things hurt you already after a great start alright come on give it a bell
[18:40.59]Where the hell is the belt?
[18:44.03]Is this just in, like, a wardrobe somewhere?
[18:46.70]There it is.
[18:48.70]Alright, alright, alright.
[18:54.32]Alright, let's go.
[18:55.04]Out, out, let's go.
[18:56.14]New hideout.
[19:03.02]I got plenty of time.
[19:05.64]Do I still use a Velcro wallet?
[19:18.83]No, I wish I still had Velcro shoes.
[19:28.88]Velcro shoes are awesome.
[19:31.72]Because... They allow you... Velcro shoes are just so easy to put on.
[19:37.34]Alright, I got two people.
[19:41.18]Let's go.
[19:46.67]He's getting better!
[19:48.51]Take the rag, leave the bottle.
[19:49.53]Let's go.
[19:50.41]Not wasting time.
[19:52.49]Velcro underwear.
[19:55.28]That doesn't make any sense.
[20:00.06]The bike man's not gonna get stuff out of the wardrobe.
[20:03.46]It's too late.
[20:04.48]I fucking... If today was a secret slime stream, just do step in poison mushrooms.
[20:12.09]It would happen immediately.
[20:21.04]He gets everything in the hideout.
[20:25.72]Well, why are you yelling at me?
[20:26.61]That's what somebody in chat just... That's what people in chat were telling me.
[20:32.25]Why is everybody yelling at me?
[20:34.31]I left it in there.
[20:35.75]Okay, I need to heal.
[20:38.77]With... No, not yet.
[20:43.28]It's not... Having that one... Okay, I'm probably going to need to heal.
[20:46.80]Okay.
[20:48.46]Found a cottage.
[20:50.03]Wait, I haven't seen this yet.
[20:53.37]What?
[20:53.73]Get out of here.
[20:54.61]Oh my fucking god.
[20:56.35]Really?
[20:58.29]No, not really.
[20:59.89]You're still... He's just tracking me.
[21:01.97]Dude, get the fuck out of here.
[21:08.89]I don't wanna... Now I have to heal.
[21:31.74]Whatever, I... I need to see what's in here.
[21:34.95]No, I'm on a very specific mission, I can do it later.
[21:38.43]The hunter becomes the hunted.
[21:42.53]So I'll go up from here.
[21:51.21]Moose monkaS. I know, it's scary.
[21:59.84]Old car.
[22:01.62]Ooh, broken truck.
[22:03.14]I'll take another thing of gas.
[22:04.20]Scrap.
[22:05.74]Hello.
[22:07.12]What is it?
[22:10.92]Oh.
[22:11.58]Keep going.
[22:11.92]Just get to the- I gotta get to the hideout.
[22:12.94]I gotta focus.
[22:21.87]The wolf told me to go up here.
[22:23.95]And I need to get up there before it gets too dark.
[22:26.89]So I can get a sanctuary ready.
[22:34.80]Nothing else.
[22:35.24]Don't pick up anything.
[22:36.26]Don't do anything.
[22:37.90]Just get up there.
[22:41.93]Watch out for the poison.
[22:44.27]Straight line.
[22:45.59]The best way to go.
[22:46.33]I have to be getting close.
[22:54.88]Give me a landmark.
[22:56.32]Alright, I'm right here.
[23:02.65]Is this it?
[23:03.01]Is this the entrance?
[23:05.41]Am I going the right way?
[23:06.21]Get rid of that.
[23:13.24]Some scrap.
[23:13.76]Nice.
[23:17.72]Still over here.
[23:19.08]Found the bridge.
[23:20.20]Here we go.
[23:20.56]Uh, I'm gonna take the wood.
[23:30.59]So now I gotta get... That's kind of far away.
[23:33.77]Am I gonna even get here in time?
[23:36.77]I might have to... What the fuck?
[23:46.53]He was just zigzagging.
[24:03.63]Oh, that's so bad.
[24:05.92]Red meat.
[24:07.12]Okay, hold on.
[24:07.94]I need to make a... Oh, this shit is important.
[24:24.03]Besides the tire.
[24:33.44]Alright, get me out of here.
[24:35.97]I've got such a long way to... There's another one of these?
[24:39.63]Oh, for the love of God.
[24:49.12]Well, this sucks.
[24:56.70]He's still alive!
[24:57.38]Why is he still alive?
[25:26.05]Dammit.
[25:26.81]This is gonna suck.
[25:30.99]You telling me that's what's up here?
[25:34.82]That's what I have to be aware of now?
[25:37.82]That's what I have to deal with every time?
[25:41.12]It's no longer the guys with the... I have a long way to go to that hideout.
[25:51.35]Whatever it is, I'll get it later.
[25:52.71]Creepy house.
[25:53.45]Don't go to the creepy house.
[25:56.30]Just go to where I need to be.
[26:00.22]Is this, like, slender?
[26:03.07]Yeah, it's... Essentially, it's top-down slender.
[26:10.65]Oh, shit.
[26:11.41]This stuff that I... No, just go.
[26:13.58]Just get out.
[26:13.96]I can come back here later.
[26:14.82]I can't climb this...
[26:26.49]Almost there.
[26:27.39]Almost like halfway there.
[26:29.09]Alright, it's time to activate the runner.
[26:34.25]Go.
[26:38.57]No, no unnatural.
[26:39.45]No unnatural walling.
[26:40.35]No natural walling, please.
[26:45.36]Oh, that's a guy.
[26:48.62]Broken tree.
[26:49.68]Get in there.
[26:57.66]Almost there.
[26:59.32]Come on, don't die.
[27:00.46]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[27:08.18]Right here.
[27:33.24]I need that axe, too.
[27:34.84]Bad.
[27:38.03]I'm getting lots of meat, though.
[27:38.97]Yeah, I am.
[27:40.09]Alright, come on.
[27:40.61]Where is this?
[27:44.67]Here we are.
[27:45.19]Come on.
[27:46.29]This is it, right?
[27:47.72]Lots of wood over here.
[27:48.92]Keep this in mind.
[27:49.54]Somebody remember this.
[27:53.12]Up.
[28:03.49]This would make a good hideout.
[28:05.43]Oh yes, it would.
[28:09.75]Turn on the stove.
[28:12.16]Nobody's in here, right?
[28:14.86]There might be somebody hanging out in here, though.
[28:21.12]Turn on the stove.
[28:24.26]This actually is sick.
[28:26.78]This place is huge.
[28:28.15]I'm just gonna hide in the bathroom, Left 4 Dead 2 style.
[28:40.23]Oven.
[28:40.71]There we go.
[28:43.07]Light the oven.
[28:47.79]Awesome.
[28:50.04]240 extract.
[28:52.00]240, 240, 240.
[28:52.70]That's a shitload.
[28:53.88]Nice.
[28:55.34]Alright.
[28:57.12]Very, very good.
[28:59.66]Where's the workbench?
[29:00.74]Here.
[29:06.95]How do I get over there?
[29:09.46]Go, like, down and then around?
[29:20.84]Motherfucker.
[29:26.86]Here's the workbench.
[29:30.37]Sickle.
[29:31.05]Ooh.
[29:32.77]Is this better than a shovel?
[29:39.88]Alright, what else is over here?
[29:41.16]Mm-mm.
[29:47.56]It's not better than a shovel, huh?
[29:49.60]Okay.
[29:52.03]Alright, let me, uh... Get... Let me fill up the gas.
[29:55.93]Because I'm running out of time here.
[29:57.27]I gotta start to really think about how I'm gonna do this.
[29:59.65]I tried to pick it up!
[30:01.67]I tried to pick it up!
[30:05.30]Pfft!
[30:15.11]Okay, hold on.
[30:22.33]I gotta deposit some of this shit.
[30:28.14]Now keep that.
[30:30.26]Get the bell.
[30:31.12]Put the batteries away.
[30:34.16]Put two of the gasoline tanks away.
[30:35.92]Put the wire and the nail.
[30:37.82]Alright.
[30:38.59]Now I can actually do this shit.
[30:41.03]It's so dark in here.
[30:44.25]This is so much darker than the other ones.
[30:45.61]I wonder if I'm, like, stepping on, like, the bird shit on the ground.
[30:49.89]Okay.
[30:54.55]I'm ready to fill up the generator, which is over here.
[30:59.59]Where the fuck is the generator?
[31:00.95]Where's the cooking table?
[31:02.39]It's over here.
[31:05.97]Okay.
[31:07.23]Gas tank.
[31:12.83]Just fill it up.
[31:17.87]I got some time.
[31:20.39]I'll call the guy tomorrow.
[31:26.29]To bring my stuff.
[31:35.55]Alright, tank is empty.
[31:36.47]16.
[31:38.09]I got... Let me see.
[31:39.71]This can't be repaired.
[31:40.93]So they can come in this way.
[31:43.13]They can come in this way.
[31:44.03]So generator room is off limits.
[31:48.08]I can repair... This is alright, but no, not really.
[31:52.20]It's tiny.
[31:53.30]They can also come through here.
[31:55.32]And they can come through here.
[31:56.86]Not ideal.
[31:57.52]Here's one of the lights.
[32:01.21]This room, not ideal either.
[32:07.01]Maybe down here.
[32:08.55]Alright, so... Alright, okay.
[32:11.57]I like this area.
[32:12.67]I can board this.
[32:15.81]Okay, this is two doors here.
[32:17.05]I board this one.
[32:19.17]And then this window, barricade this window.
[32:21.24]Let's just do it now.
[32:25.90]So that's window barricaded.
[32:28.70]Which leaves me with this from here.
[32:32.18]There's the workbench.
[32:33.09]There's a way to get in this way.
[32:36.13]No windows, no other ways to get in here.
[32:40.27]What is that?
[32:41.05]Okay, so what if I just hang out in this hall?
[32:46.30]Window here.
[32:48.60]Shit.
[32:49.90]Um.
[32:54.11]Window here.
[32:54.65]Barricade it.
[33:02.03]The window.
[33:02.47]There's only two windows in this.
[33:03.55]Okay.
[33:04.04]Wooden door.
[33:04.56]There's a lot of open space here.
[33:11.82]The safest place in this whole house is probably right here.
[33:16.71]Like, right here.
[33:19.81]Down, like, in this bottom hallway.
[33:21.07]Because there's a lot of places they can get in.
[33:26.21]Or in here.
[33:27.05]But you get stuck in here.
[33:28.15]I don't know.
[33:32.57]I'm running out of time, though.
[33:33.33]So I have to do this now.
[33:41.40]I could go like this.
[33:45.48]And put traps everywhere.
[33:48.10]Hold on.
[33:49.22]Let me make a few traps.
[33:50.76]Let me go to the workbench.
[33:51.46]Um... Sh- Fuck!
[33:58.22]There's too many rooms for me to think about what I want to do.
[34:00.40]I only have like f- f- eight minutes to figure this out!
[34:05.59]When I built my house in Minecraft, it took me like four hours!
[34:11.63]What about up here?
[34:13.65]Barricade this.
[34:19.00]Okay.
[34:20.34]Barricade this door, too.
[34:21.88]I think this is alright right here.
[34:24.06]For the first night.
[34:26.34]Oh, check this out.
[34:27.20]Watch this.
[34:30.23]Door right here is alright.
[34:31.31]I'm going to barricade this door.
[34:38.23]So check this.
[34:41.72]I can be up here.
[34:43.88]They can come in through this door.
[34:46.39]I have barricaded window, barricaded door.
[34:48.09]There's an entry here.
[34:49.53]There's also an... Oh.
[34:53.59]Alright.
[34:54.51]This might be a pretty good spot to be here.
[34:56.93]I need the... I need the light.
[34:58.11]I need the lights.
[34:58.55]I need the lights right now.
[35:01.87]It's so fucking dark.
[35:03.23]Give me a break.
[35:03.92]I can't see shit.
[35:07.20]I'm just turning the fucking generator on.
[35:08.88]I don't even know where anything is in this house.
[35:11.88]There's only one lamp... There's only one lamp here.
[35:15.55]Oh, that's not good.
[35:24.96]Just get all the windows.
[35:32.04]This is coming in the hall just for tonight.
[35:33.42]And then tomorrow, when I have infinite time, I can figure this out.
[35:37.69]This is coming over here.
[35:44.62]Make sure I have, like, a weapon.
[35:45.78]This is gonna be hell.
[36:01.43]Okay, so they can't... There's no way to get in through here unless they break that wall.
[36:09.27]I can bring the wardrobe over to... Wait, I need items.
[36:12.49]I need items right now.
[36:13.67]Where's the workbench?
[36:15.54]I don't remember where the workbench is.
[36:16.72]It's like down here.
[36:19.22]Okay, um... Battery.
[36:21.18]I still have a magazine.
[36:24.02]I still have the shovel.
[36:26.53]Store this stuff.
[36:27.81]This heals.
[36:29.93]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[36:35.97]I have some heals.
[36:37.91]Speaking of heals, I got like a second.
[36:40.59]Okay.
[36:41.13]No, no, no, no.
[36:41.58]Get me in.
[36:46.84]Alright.
[36:47.16]I can't barricade this door.
[36:53.66]I'm gonna have to go for it.
[37:05.77]One, two points of entry.
[37:08.41]Is there anything I can grab here, like a chair or something, right off the bat?
[37:10.97]I need, stop moving, stop, stop, stop, just stop, stop, stop.
[37:16.57]Close the door.
[37:29.08]Oh, fuck.
[37:33.70]What is it?
[37:34.12]But what is it, though?
[37:34.72]What kind of enemy is it?
[37:39.54]At least I have a place to run.
[37:44.20]Keep that in mind.
[37:44.76]I have a place to run below me.
[37:48.03]And I'm still in the house, and I can wrap around.
[37:52.91]Holy shit, he left.
[37:56.45]Dog!
[37:56.85]A dog just saved my life!
[38:00.87]A dog just saved my life.
[38:04.58]No, he didn't.
[38:06.12]He just got one hit KO'd.
[38:20.30]Point blank right in the head.
[38:28.50]What is it?
[38:30.50]Oh, it's...
[38:41.08]He's going to break the door.
[38:43.70]It's just a dog.
[38:47.64]I'm going to open the door and hit him.
[38:50.90]Oh, fuck.
[38:51.32]Did I break the door?
[38:58.61]Where is it?
[39:10.73]Oh shit, it's down there.
[39:12.13]He doesn't know he can go around.
[39:16.56]I'm gonna aim here.
[39:20.72]Because there's something in the house.
[39:24.46]Where is it?
[39:27.87]Oh shit.
[39:28.63]Okay, gotta be ready.
[39:39.60]What is it?
[39:40.38]Duck?
[39:47.11]Fuck!
[39:48.45]I'm in trouble now.
[39:57.51]Where is it?
[39:58.81]Oh my god, it's right there.
[40:16.58]TAKE IT!
[40:17.50]TAH!
[40:17.99]WHY?!
[40:18.49]Nobody move.
[40:34.55]It's three big dogs.
[40:49.57]So what happened?
[40:50.41]One of the dogs ate the other dog?
[40:54.00]What am I drinking?
[40:55.08]That is, uh, water with a little bit of lemon in it.
[40:59.84]Just gives it just enough for a little bit of a kick.
[41:03.12]OH MY GOD!
[41:07.57]IT'S ALMOST EIGHT!
[41:08.55]PLEASE!
[41:13.33]Was that too- Was that you guys- Was that somebody in chat?
[41:20.81]Did I just get stream sniped?
[41:26.07]They both came in instantly and attacked me insta- what?
[41:29.98]Where the fuck were they for the last like hour and 40 minutes?
[41:36.30]Yeah, it's a water!
[41:46.80]God damn it.
[41:47.78]It was like 7 30.
[42:00.22]Oh, that sucks.
[42:05.68]Pain in the ass.
[42:07.46]Alright, so... Now that I have a minute to look... Let me turn the generator off first, that's important.
[42:22.11]Died to lemon water.
[42:24.97]If I had my hands on... I have to like talk with my fucking hands.
[42:30.02]Why can't I just sit here?
[42:33.00]What's going on in this room?
[42:40.26]That... No, I didn't die to lemon water.
[42:42.40]I died to animated speaking.
[42:47.11]Well, you see, just a little bit of a kick of that lemon juice, the lemon will, oh, and there's, oh, hold on, I'm playing a game over here.
[43:06.67]Alright, generator's off.
[43:09.19]I have infinite time.
[43:11.09]Now, let's go over a strategy.
[43:15.95]This is not a terrible strategy, but it's not a lot of room to move.
[43:19.97]So, I think I want to be in here.
[43:23.49]There's enough places to move.
[43:28.88]I could potentially barricade this room as well with the oven.
[43:32.32]And then if only I can... There's a door here.
[43:34.54]I can barricade this and need to worry about these two spots.
[43:38.20]Trap.
[43:39.02]Check this out.
[43:40.40]Trap.
[43:41.98]Trap.
[43:44.41]trap this is where I'm going this is the one there's three mushrooms in here I'm gonna step on them I won't if I step on one trap for the remainder of this stream I will do a spin in a circle
[44:17.41]Alright, so, uhhhh... We're back to the cooking utensil thing.
[44:28.25]Here we go.
[44:28.75]Level up.
[44:30.65]We have a new tier.
[44:33.85]Careful step.
[44:34.47]Once a day, you won't trigger a trap that you step on.
[44:37.19]If I step on another trap for the rest of the day... I'll be able to restore my health by eating wood.
[44:52.50]Once a day, I'll be able to scare off nearby enemies.
[44:55.20]Yes, I don't care what the other ones do.
[44:58.47]I'll recover longer after exhausting myself.
[45:01.41]When my stamina gets low, I will deal less damage in combat.
[45:03.81]These are both so awful.
[45:08.43]Just eat your way out of the forest.
[45:11.86]Eat wood.
[45:12.50]Eat wood.
[45:12.96]Eat your desk.
[45:13.96]Bite your desk.
[45:17.26]That is good.
[45:18.70]But...
[45:22.18]I feel like this is a... If I had this, I probably would have survived the night last night.
[45:37.17]Yeah.
[45:37.55]And this one too.
[45:38.93]I don't want it.
[45:39.49]This one seems horrible.
[45:41.69]When my stamina gets low, I'll deal less damage in combat.
[45:43.97]They're both horrible.
[45:44.91]They're both just game ruiners.
[45:50.29]Which one is worse?
[46:00.59]I don't know.
[46:03.33]Weaklings only happens when you put your stamina at zero.
[46:08.05]Yeah, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, it's done.
[46:20.86]Eat wood, Omega LOL.
[46:23.86]Oh, I get what you're doing.
[46:32.55]Okay, now... Let's go over here.
[46:39.85]A smell of grass and trees.
[46:46.66]The Earth bends under my footsteps.
[46:48.14]The sky swirls pleasantly.
[46:49.78]I think it's here.
[46:58.37]Bugs.
[46:59.75]Haven't even had two headphones in this whole time.
[47:04.43]That's why I've been so bad.
[47:08.20]Oh, I wasn't expecting this.
[47:09.46]A completely ordinary dead man with a smile on his face.
[47:17.44]Is that a... Is that a... Is that a Monka?
[47:22.53]I think?
[47:24.93]I don't know.
[47:25.33]I'm not sure what to say in the chat.
[47:27.95]Can you hear it?
[47:36.74]This is actually kind of scary.
[47:41.73]Heeeey!
[47:44.29]Can you hear it?
[47:44.85]Yes, it's you!
[47:45.71]It's me!
[47:46.51]Can you hear their song?
[47:49.41]Get out of here!
[47:55.53]Get out of here, you fucking mana wraith!
[47:59.88]You pre-spell!
[48:02.34]They deleted you from the game because you sucked!
[48:13.53]Oh, what's that?
[48:14.23]What's that?
[48:14.89]Oh, it's a live stream from Jerma985?
[48:16.99]Gotta have one WoW reference per stream.
[48:21.29]This game sucks.
[48:31.92]Alright, what do we got?
[48:33.78]What?
[48:34.56]Why did that happen?
[48:44.35]Ooh, I have one of these.
[48:45.05]4,000.
[48:45.07]I'm already 20% of the way there.
[48:52.98]Not even.
[48:53.28]I'm 22% of the way there.
[48:53.84]I'm 20% of the way there.
[49:14.78]Let's see.
[49:15.95]Where do I want to go?
[49:18.37]Jerma's sweating.
[49:19.31]Why am I sweating?
[49:28.08]It's been like 50 minutes.
[49:29.48]Okay.
[49:39.64]It's your overreactive glands.
[49:47.91]It's only been like 10 minutes.
[49:49.57]It's been an hour.
[49:50.29]That's how you know that this stream is popping.
[49:54.69]I got like my YouTuber glands.
[49:56.18]Alright.
[50:05.52]I'm so glad I have frozen time.
[50:08.05]So.
[50:09.62]I need to make traps.
[50:10.54]I need scrap metal.
[50:11.30]I got a little bit.
[50:12.10]I can make, like, two, three.
[50:14.63]What the fuck do I want to do now?
[50:26.39]Turn off the webcam.
[50:32.24]Why would it turn... Alright, one guy.
[50:34.40]Okay.
[50:41.77]I'm back.
[50:43.59]So, traps.
[50:44.29]Let's build them.
[50:46.35]Let's build them.
[50:47.13]Let's build them.
[50:47.89]Let's build them.
[50:48.59]Let's build them.
[50:52.03]Need to be the workbench.
[50:53.39]I want bear traps because they're the best.
[50:58.67]He's already... He's already forgotten where the workbench is.
[51:02.86]Because this whole game...
[51:05.69]is gray.
[51:07.79]With some orange in it.
[51:08.89]And sometimes his brain cannot decipher between orange and gray.
[51:15.32]Because he didn't pay attention in school.
[51:20.92]Okay.
[51:22.60]Bear trap.
[51:25.34]Make three of them.
[51:31.23]These are going to help me out immensely very soon.
[51:35.88]Speak up a little.
[51:36.82]Okay, fine.
[51:39.36]Well, there goes the scrap I needed to make sure I could have a weapon.
[51:43.28]But it's okay, I'll find some.
[51:45.82]Now, these are going to go over here.
[51:47.96]I think this is the best spot for me.
[51:50.92]Might not be the best spot for you.
[51:53.91]Because I can barricade this door, I can hang out in here, I can have a piece of furniture.
[52:00.45]Once this guy gets out of the way, let's get this one down here first.
[52:04.83]Actually, I'm actually more comfortable having this down here.
[52:06.61]Okay.
[52:26.96]So if I do this, can the dogs jump over the table?
[52:29.73]I don't think the dogs can jump over.
[52:34.71]Maybe they can.
[52:38.19]That's a good question.
[52:38.99]Anyways, here we go.
[52:41.14]I'm thinking of a scenario where we take these three and they go like this.
[52:50.77]Put something here.
[52:52.07]And then right here... Bang.
[52:55.39]They'll get caught in it.
[52:56.75]If they turn.
[52:58.07]There's one.
[53:00.94]And then that'll give me time.
[53:02.04]I'm gonna put a piece of furniture here.
[53:06.26]And then one here.
[53:08.22]I'm gonna... Where am I gonna stand, though, is the real question.
[53:10.71]Stand... I'll be standing here.
[53:15.28]Because my back against this wall, nobody can get in this way.
[53:17.82]This corner is pretty good.
[53:19.51]So if I stand up here, that means that this would have to go here.
[53:22.57]Because they would be... Essentially, they'd break through and they'd be running up this way.
[53:25.81]So right there.
[53:28.47]God, I hope this is right!
[53:32.96]Okay.
[53:33.96]The third one... Is gonna go down here.
[53:42.14]Right here.
[53:45.30]Because they'll break open the door and they'll come up this way.
[53:48.86]I am now ready.
[54:04.85]Oh, fuck.
[54:06.75]It's ready.
[54:07.21]The room is good.
[54:08.59]There's my entrance.
[54:13.49]There's my other entrance.
[54:17.44]I hope I can get back in there.
[54:19.62]When I come back, when I come back, and when you see my character Avatar walk through these doors, please, for the love of God, I want everybody collectively to type in all capitals, BEAR TRAPS.
[54:39.71]It's the only thing I want to see over here.
[54:43.84]Because I'm going to forget this exists in like 30 minutes when I come back after scavenging out here.
[54:49.96]And I'll walk in one.
[54:51.02]And I'll go like this.
[54:54.06]Oh, what the fuck?
[54:56.95]And everyone will be like, yeah, well, it's funny.
[55:00.03]And then I'll be irritated.
[55:01.51]Alright.
[55:11.94]Oh, no, don't do that.
[55:14.61]I'll take a mushroom.
[55:16.63]I have an axe head.
[55:17.79]What do I need to build the axe?
[55:20.07]That's very important to me.
[55:22.09]Give me the scrap.
[55:25.65]How many nails do I have?
[55:26.62]I'm gonna buy them all.
[55:27.48]I have plenty of money.
[55:29.60]This guy... This guy loves me.
[55:31.54]So, like, he's just gonna give all this shit to me.
[55:36.60]Another magazine for the gun.
[55:40.25]gas tank alright we'll take this but not he nods okay I need Joe alright I thought I stepped in the trap I have to cook this Jesus Christ what the am I doing
[56:09.65]I don't want to come back in this room until I have to.
[56:20.55]They need to be placed, though.
[56:21.71]They have to be there.
[56:22.75]Alright, I'm ready.
[56:24.42]That's the survive room.
[56:26.08]I'm gonna bring the light over there, too, before anybody starts to panic.
[56:31.34]Okay.
[56:33.72]Get the rags.
[56:35.86]And a battery.
[56:39.19]I got plenty of lockpicks.
[56:40.99]I took the magazine.
[56:42.97]Alright, let's do this thing.
[56:48.25]Disarm them now and then arm them at night.
[56:50.19]That's a very decent chance.
[56:51.85]That's a very decent debate there.
[56:53.65]But if you dismantle them, you get two scrap.
[56:55.93]Then they take three to make.
[56:57.47]Why would somebody have that as an emote?
[57:07.70]I just thought something was wrong with my channel.
[57:12.86]Alright.
[57:16.33]I want to make sure I don't forget anything that was in these boxes.
[57:19.41]I know there was some shit around here.
[57:22.17]That room is good to go.
[57:23.09]Here we go.
[57:23.55]Wardrobe, pills, rags.
[57:25.01]I don't want to forget anything.
[57:28.32]I'm going to grab the lamp just to get it over there so I don't panic later.
[57:43.86]Ring the bell.
[57:46.24]That's also a good idea.
[57:47.38]I will do that too.
[57:48.61]I think I can just run it in there now.
[57:58.19]Or at least close enough.
[58:00.09]How am I going to get this in the room with the bear traps?
[58:04.87]I'm going to carefully do that now.
[58:06.53]Because when it's like 17 o'clock...
[58:10.45]That ain't... This is not gonna happen.
[58:11.99]I will panic and I will activate like three of the traps.
[58:14.59]There are only three traps in there, so... You know what I mean.
[58:22.28]Can you help?
[58:38.05]This won't... It's not going to catch this in the trap, right?
[58:40.79]Ooh, easy.
[59:15.05]We're good.
[59:18.57]That can stick right there.
[59:20.68]I like this setup.
[59:22.14]That's going down.
[59:24.22]And then I'll put something else up here.
[59:31.60]Yeah.
[59:32.30]Alright.
[59:32.76]Any of the big furniture around here?
[59:34.08]There's gotta be, like, a big piece of furniture I can drag, right?
[59:38.91]Workbench.
[59:39.49]There's a wardrobe.
[59:42.23]Welder.
[59:43.03]Gentleman magazine?
[59:44.19]Okay.
[59:55.85]Bear trap.
[59:56.69]I know the bear traps are in there.
[59:58.81]I know the bear traps are in that room.
[60:00.31]I'm talking about for like, like 35 minutes from now when I leave and come back.
[60:12.95]It's fun to decorate your house.
[60:21.64]So this one's gonna go up.
[60:23.38]Because that one's gonna block that doorway.
[60:27.04]Leave.
[60:27.36]Alright.
[60:33.65]Is that gonna be enough to block?
[60:36.87]I don't think so.
[60:41.09]No.
[60:41.31]It's enough to be annoying, though.
[60:42.72]So I can know when someone's coming in.
[60:48.81]No, it's alright.
[60:49.73]That's not terrible.
[60:50.81]That's enough to be annoying.
[60:53.03]Stop being mean to the traitor.
[60:59.55]Kidding.
[61:01.01]Alright, I'm happy with that.
[61:05.35]I wish I could repair my shovel, because that's... Did I get... I got more nails, but did I get enough to... Let's see...
[61:18.08]Oh, I do.
[61:18.52]Okay, I do.
[61:19.34]I do.
[61:20.40]I do.
[61:21.90]Just... No, I don't.
[61:29.39]Fuck.
[61:32.09]I... Okay.
[61:34.53]I need to use the bell.
[61:39.69]Something's happening.
[61:43.53]I'll give you an alcohol.
[61:45.89]Do I have alcohol in my inventory?
[61:51.01]Where is he?
[61:54.52]Front door?
[61:55.04]Back door?
[61:55.52]Ooh, this is big.
[61:59.50]I can pick that up.
[62:00.14]I'll move that later.
[62:06.38]Where's this guy?
[62:09.30]I know, where are you?
[62:27.96]Kill traitor.
[62:29.98]Where's the guy on the bike?
[62:31.04]I just heard his bell like twice.
[62:37.88]Oh, you're all the way out here.
[62:38.78]Uh, here's some alcohol.
[62:44.92]A good vintage.
[62:45.66]A bottle a day keeps the monsters away.
[62:47.06]To your health.
[62:48.18]I can bring you junk from the other hideout.
[62:51.41]Which hideout should I take the junk from, boss?
[62:54.03]From the silent forest.
[62:55.71]Ooh, on it like a fox in a trash can.
[63:01.88]See you later.
[63:05.92]First course of action is... Where... What did the... Let me look at my journal.
[63:16.51]I remember the face of the man who saved me.
[63:18.55]Where's, um... The wolf.
[63:22.24]Northwestern part of the dry meadow.
[63:27.30]Well, it's up here.
[63:30.26]Okay, so that's not that far.
[63:32.10]That's kind of the place.
[63:35.80]We'll go do that.
[63:38.59]I do need a couple pieces of wood, though, to repair my shovel.
[63:43.01]I don't feel comfortable going up there.
[63:44.39]Did I look at everything?
[63:45.17]Let me make sure I did.
[63:51.74]Nope.
[63:52.29]Note.
[63:53.63]Who the hell are they assigning to us?
[63:56.51]Maciek fucked off from the shack.
[63:59.27]The whole night he was rambling about some Merrick.
[64:01.78]I think his younger brother or son.
[64:03.18]I don't know if it was the boredom or the stress that got to him, but he was fucking unbearable.
[64:07.42]It was the third night in a row.
[64:11.07]We tried to silence him, but it's fucking Masiak.
[64:14.15]Better not risk it.
[64:15.19]I slid inside my sleeping bag and zipped it shut.
[64:17.86]I prefer to suffocate in my own stench than listen to that fuckhead go on and on about it.
[64:24.00]After a while, I realized Masiak is not there anymore.
[64:26.26]He left around morning.
[64:27.80]He took all his equipment, three liters of water, a sleeping bag, radio, gun, gasoline, flamethrower...
[64:34.30]And his lucky stone.
[64:36.67]He only left the hazard suit.
[64:38.53]We're debating on whether to report this.
[64:40.97]No one's crazy about running around the woods looking for a psycho with a flamethrower.
[64:48.05]Well, we'll know who that is if we come across them.
[64:53.63]Checking one few more little things.
[64:56.09]Any objects that I missed.
[64:57.77]I can get wood right here.
[65:01.17]Thanks to the person in chat that told me there was wood out here.
[65:06.51]The saw needs gas.
[65:22.44]Repair the shovel, and we're out.
[65:28.05]By the way, this is the wrong place.
[65:38.82]So over here.
[65:39.24]I was going up here.
[65:39.80]So he's up there.
[65:42.67]That's not bad.
[65:43.21]Good to know.
[66:08.67]Let's get some logs.
[66:12.71]And now let me repair my shit.
[66:18.58]Looking good.
[66:20.04]I should be able to repair the shovel.
[66:21.56]And then we move.
[66:22.80]We move.
[66:23.50]That's just north.
[66:36.50]North... No, North... I flipped it around.
[66:41.95]Wait, hold on.
[66:43.17]I... Um... Northeast... I used to... I used to live in the Northeast.
[66:48.77]Okay.
[66:54.31]Don't queue.
[67:00.53]I should know what that is.
[67:07.77]It's because I have these headphones.
[67:10.15]If I had both these headphones out, I could feel my brain power coming back.
[67:15.76]It's like breathing again.
[67:17.48]When they're in... I can fucking breathe again when they're out.
[67:36.06]Somebody just say because I'm a vegan?
[67:40.44]What the fuck are you talking about?
[67:45.00]What does that even mean?
[67:46.76]Alright.
[67:52.84]Nothing else from you that I want.
[67:56.89]Let's do it.
[67:59.13]Workbench.
[68:00.67]Prepare the shovel.
[68:02.03]Make sure I have healing items.
[68:04.97]Good.
[68:05.77]Upgrade item.
[68:06.69]Maybe I can.
[68:07.77]No, I can't.
[68:10.79]Take the proper healing.
[68:14.17]And we're going northeast.
[68:18.07]Bandage.
[68:20.75]Looking good.
[68:21.65]These flares.
[68:22.79]I'm gonna sell them.
[68:25.07]Make two bandages.
[68:26.21]Why not two?
[68:27.81]Make another one of these.
[68:30.75]Another one of these.
[68:34.73]Put the welder away.
[68:35.67]I might need it for something.
[68:40.58]Okay.
[68:41.38]We don't need the wood.
[68:42.48]We do not need the scrap metal.
[68:43.90]We do not need the weapon parts.
[68:44.84]We do not need the... We need the battery.
[68:46.06]We need one battery, I think.
[68:48.80]That's sufficient.
[68:49.50]We need the two clips.
[68:50.50]We don't need the rags anymore.
[68:51.60]Actually, I do.
[68:52.06]Maybe you can... No, I don't.
[68:53.00]I got plenty of healing.
[68:54.86]Uh, flashlight.
[68:55.60]Two.
[68:56.58]Nails.
[68:56.98]Go away.
[68:58.31]Don't need these pills.
[68:59.51]Welder.
[68:59.91]Go away.
[69:00.41]Bottle.
[69:01.07]Alcohol.
[69:01.97]Here.
[69:02.45]We.
[69:03.17]Go.
[69:03.61]Get rid of that bandage.
[69:04.43]I got three.
[69:05.95]Get rid of the flares.
[69:09.50]Three healing, one battery, two clips.
[69:14.44]Any food?
[69:16.00]No.
[69:17.08]Let's go.
[69:18.03]I'm ready.
[69:21.53]Lockpicking.
[69:23.19]You're right!
[69:24.85]Take the five stack.
[69:28.31]And that's it.
[69:36.14]Good to go.
[69:37.50]So we're going up here, northeast.
[69:46.88]Nice bangs.
[69:49.12]I'm gonna get angry.
[69:55.31]I mean it right here.
[69:56.25]Just... Let's go.
[70:20.05]You guys want some Pringles?
[70:21.93]Pringles are awesome.
[70:25.24]Actually, I take that back.
[70:27.66]Original Pringles are awful.
[70:32.78]But cheese Pringles are like B tier.
[70:37.97]I fucking can not do it.
[71:00.16]Of course, this is like a poison area.
[71:13.37]What are you even living up here for?
[71:34.19]Found road.
[71:36.23]Wait.
[71:38.63]Road.
[71:39.13]That's not where I want to go.
[71:43.08]Unnatural walling here.
[71:45.72]It's gonna go all the way up.
[71:47.02]Gotta go down.
[71:53.70]Take me home.
[71:54.38]I have to go back through this shit.
[72:10.09]Slow it down.
[72:11.89]Barn ruins.
[72:14.35]Is he up here?
[72:42.78]Dogs?
[72:43.54]Oh, there's a lot of dogs.
[72:49.20]There's a lot of dogs here.
[72:50.92]A lot of them.
[73:14.30]Is it a dog?
[73:15.24]No!
[73:47.03]We could open it with a lockpick.
[73:48.07]What the hell is going on up here?
[73:53.69]We can go down here.
[74:16.41]Hey!
[74:16.89]Oh shit, what's with all the dogs?
[74:19.69]What's even up here?
[75:08.70]I'm dead.
[75:09.00]I'm dead.
[75:09.82]I'm dead.
[75:10.80]I'm dead.
[75:11.16]Why are you not on the hotbar?
[75:15.32]I don't want to shoot this gun.
[75:37.95]Everybody won't know where I- All the dogs won't know where I am!
[75:40.23]This fucking reach sucks!
[76:09.57]What happened?
[76:10.21]Oh shit, a dog is in front of me!
[76:43.79]It's two down.
[76:50.06]I thought this was going to be just a breeze to get back up here.
[76:52.96]Okay.
[76:53.90]I think this is already to go back up there, though.
[76:59.75]Let's see.
[77:10.82]First of all, get this on the hotbar.
[77:14.26]What are you, dumb?
[77:21.65]Are you fucking kidding me?
[78:05.92]Is there nothing over here?
[78:13.56]No, there's this.
[78:49.93]There's nothing in here.
[78:51.81]Where the fuck am I going?
[78:54.41]Is this a person?
[78:57.85]I found him!
[79:03.56]The greeting sound- I found him!
[79:06.38]The greeting sounds like an angry growl.
[79:07.90]The wolf makes a quick leap and, bouncing against me with his swollen belly, he puts his paws on my shoulders.
[79:13.26]He ostentatiously licks his face.
[79:18.21]What a gift you've given me!
[79:20.91]What?
[79:23.15]I notice fresh blood stains on his fur and feel streaks of his saliva dripping onto my coat.
[79:28.03]He leans towards me as if he wanted to say something to my ear.
[79:36.60]What?
[79:36.80]Thanks to you, I feel fulfilled.
[79:55.24]I've got my girl, my sweet lady.
[79:57.46]Hard to believe the same blood flows through the veins of... I just got a rifle.
[80:01.74]This bitch reeks of chicken.
[80:03.68]What?
[80:04.68]Suddenly, the wolf sends me back with a powerful push and reaches into his coat pocket.
[80:07.86]Some object hits the floor.
[80:08.82]Here, no need to thank me.
[80:12.36]Now, since that part of the deal is behind us, I'll help you recover your stupid key.
[80:16.12]I will take you back to the doctor's house.
[80:17.80]I'm sure you'll find some clues on how to reach his current hideout while there.
[80:22.95]You two will have a little chat.
[80:24.61]You will get back what you've lost, and then nothing will keep you from getting the fuck out of my part of the woods.
[80:29.11]Do you get me, meat?
[80:30.50]You will pack your bags, dive into that stinking hole of yours, and dis a fucking pier.
[80:35.00]I appreciate the dis a fucking pier.
[80:39.16]Return to the doctor's house.
[80:41.62]And, are we good?
[80:42.40]So he gave me a rifle.
[80:49.90]Are we good?
[80:53.59]I mean... I don't think so.
[81:01.79]I think I want more.
[81:04.39]You know, got like a coupon back there for me somehow?
[81:11.86]I wonder, is the rifle any good?
[81:15.54]Oh, are we good?
[81:17.92]Hey, we good?
[81:25.54]Did I get it?
[81:26.20]Are we going?
[81:31.42]Huh?
[81:32.20]I can't seem to see.
[81:33.32]I need my glasses, I think.
[81:38.03]Let's go.
[81:39.53]Wait, do I have the rifle?
[81:44.17]I had the earphones in.
[81:45.01]I'm telling you.
[81:46.63]I don't know.
[81:47.03]There's something wrong with me.
[81:49.29]Let's go.
[81:55.98]I'm so glad I stuck that out.
[81:58.62]I saw at least two or three people in the chat that said, Get out!
[82:01.42]Get out!
[82:02.10]Stupid!
[82:02.60]Get out!
[82:03.02]Just... Bad!
[82:07.79]And then they fucking almost passed out.
[82:16.37]Stupid and... Bad!
[82:21.52]Wait, where am I?
[82:24.31]Look, I'll agree with you.
[82:25.03]I am pretty stupid, and I am pretty bad.
[82:28.05]Don't remind me.
[82:28.77]That's rude.
[82:33.54]Alright, where am I?
[82:34.72]Where are we?
[82:36.14]Time is frozen.
[82:39.96]Jerma, you're a Ren and Stimpy character.
[82:41.58]I don't know why I know exactly what you're talking about.
[82:51.66]I think it's time for a change.
[82:52.72]No more faces.
[82:54.19]I'm just going to be emotionless.
[83:03.95]Destroyed well, bro.
[83:11.29]Locked.
[83:11.73]I need a key.
[83:14.01]I just want to see it.
[83:21.87]Where's the rifle?
[83:23.00]Hunting rifle.
[83:24.60]What kind of bolts does that take?
[83:25.82]Don't jump off.
[83:37.38]Medium?
[83:38.24]Medium caliber?
[83:38.88]Pretty sick.
[83:46.01]Oh, jeez!
[84:01.26]Bear trap.
[84:01.92]Bear trap.
[84:02.34]There it was.
[84:02.94]We told you.
[84:03.80]We told you.
[84:04.56]We told you.
[84:05.22]We told you about it.
[84:12.68]What's the single best episode of television you've ever seen in your whole life?
[84:24.81]Good choices there.
[84:25.97]I see a couple of good choices.
[84:29.32]Plain countryside bed.
[84:30.46]The metal buckles of the leather straps fastened to the bottom of the bed are twisted and broken.
[84:41.61]SpongeBob pizza episode.
[84:42.83]I can't do anything to this person?
[84:49.95]Did he move you out of the way?
[85:00.00]I can't move him out of the way.
[85:03.72]Go in another part of the house then.
[85:08.46]Can't go this way.
[85:09.26]All the way around.
[85:16.47]Um.
[85:23.93]Is there a door here?
[85:25.29]I can't grab this.
[85:28.85]It's dark in here.
[85:30.65]Give me a break.
[85:31.81]It's dark.
[85:32.21]The game is dark.
[85:32.89]By its very design.
[85:33.69]The game is designed for you not to be able to see what you're doing.
[85:44.12]The doctor?
[85:46.10]Where is the doctor?
[85:50.70]Daddy went out and left.
[85:54.24]Angry and hungry he was.
[85:57.85]I'm hungry too.
[85:59.07]Don't get up.
[86:02.21]Can't move.
[86:02.69]Head is exploding.
[86:05.91]And if I move, I'll burst myself.
[86:14.74]Here.
[86:15.68]No, that's not meat.
[86:18.50]Here, have some of this.
[86:19.22]Go get it.
[86:23.88]It's delicious.
[86:34.57]Didn't want it.
[86:35.68]I tried.
[86:38.02]Partially decomposed corpse.
[86:39.26]The left hand has been bitten off together with the arm.
[86:45.05]That's disgusting.
[86:51.73]Ooh, generator.
[87:07.33]Do I have to keep this stuff?
[87:08.13]I mean, time is frozen, that usually means.
[87:09.49]Odd stone.
[87:12.35]Alright, I'll take it.
[87:25.92]Strange.
[87:26.44]Why is this bed different when I come over here?
[87:34.74]Is it way down?
[87:37.39]Couple of ways down.
[87:38.15]It's safe.
[87:39.81]Oh shit.
[87:42.25]Somebody's coming in here.
[87:46.43]Maybe not.
[87:55.84]Cage.
[87:56.60]Huge empty cages.
[87:59.90]Huge empty cages.
[88:08.50]Lock, save, lock to the code.
[88:09.57]I don't know the code.
[88:14.65]Eight, nine... Eight, nine, nine, three.
[88:19.46]Was that a code?
[88:21.46]No, those are shoes.
[88:40.60]Destroyed.
[88:41.64]Well, destroyed 125p.
[88:46.24]What's the code for this?
[88:47.20]Do I have a code?
[88:47.98]I didn't go this way.
[88:57.73]Easy.
[89:02.39]I know him.
[89:06.35]Wait, this is the prologue.
[89:09.42]This is the guy.
[89:22.24]Oh shit.
[89:22.68]Did I already open this?
[89:38.57]You guys told me there was only one person that ate people in this game.
[89:44.85]Ice?
[89:59.32]Rotten mushroom.
[90:03.34]What the fuck do I do?
[90:04.68]How do I take this stuff?
[90:05.72]Okay.
[90:15.53]Battery, no.
[90:16.45]I have to get back.
[90:25.03]This is worth a lot of money.
[90:27.25]This doesn't do anything.
[90:33.49]Thanks for not letting me waste time.
[90:45.98]I still want the ice, though.
[90:53.40]Cooking ice.
[90:58.20]You can't cook it.
[90:59.08]Cook the ice.
[91:00.83]I'll take one stack.
[91:01.69]I've never seen it before.
[91:02.39]I don't know what it does.
[91:05.81]Alright, that's fine.
[91:15.40]Outside.
[91:16.08]Can I jump this?
[91:25.22]I cannot.
[91:26.76]Nothing else over here.
[91:36.99]This is fucked up.
[91:39.43]This game is fucked up.
[91:43.80]I need a code.
[92:02.40]That's not a shoe.
[92:03.22]Those are not shoes.
[92:05.99]That's 1, 5.
[92:06.21]1, 5, 9.
[92:06.51]4.
[92:06.53]1, 5, 4, 9.
[92:06.87]I had the right idea with the shoes, just wrong place.
[92:19.67]1, 9.
[92:23.47]What was it?
[92:23.79]1, 9.
[92:23.83]1, 9, 5, 4.
[92:42.73]1, 9.
[92:42.77]Wait.
[92:48.33]So that's not a 1, this is just a 5.
[92:49.55]5, 4, 9?
[92:49.93]That's not 15?
[92:52.09]Okay, that's just the piece here.
[92:55.36]5, 4, 9.
[92:55.50]5, 4, 9.
[92:55.68]5, 4, 9.
[93:15.46]What was the other number?
[93:20.54]One, five?
[93:23.67]Four, nine?
[93:24.27]Photo.
[93:45.26]It's somewhere else, Mr. Stupid.
[93:46.88]Zero viewers.
[93:47.54]Everybody left.
[93:48.44]They couldn't handle me looking at this.
[93:49.82]They couldn't take me trying to find the safe code, and they all took off.
[93:52.94]All of them.
[93:54.50]Alright, there's a photo.
[93:58.94]Eight.
[94:00.58]Five.
[94:02.01]Five, four, nine, eight.
[94:03.27]Let's try that.
[94:17.61]5, 4, 8, 9?
[94:17.79]5, 8, 4, 5, 9?
[94:18.33]There it is.
[94:41.96]Map, code, toy.
[94:44.62]Doctor's note with a code.
[94:46.34]The code to the cart door, 8909.
[94:48.25]8909.
[94:48.27]Remember that.
[94:55.17]Note with a code.
[94:57.77]Okay.
[94:58.13]The map shows location of some train.
[95:01.77]Train wreck.
[95:03.00]And then a toy.
[95:03.92]Okay.
[95:08.24]Okay.
[95:23.25]Alright.
[95:29.34]I got my heal ready.
[95:30.16]I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[95:43.18]Free wood.
[95:48.73]The tree's blocked the way ahead.
[95:51.89]What the fuck?
[96:00.66]What the hell?
[96:07.44]Map?
[96:08.60]I can't use a map.
[96:10.36]Map.
[96:10.74]Map.
[96:11.10]I can't do that.
[96:14.22]Use map.
[96:15.30]What?
[96:26.03]I can't do that.
[96:27.71]I can probably just leave.
[96:28.69]Do I have to leave just all the way out?
[96:32.06]I think I did everything I can.
[96:32.98]Wait, what about down here?
[96:36.08]I don't think I looked down here yet.
[96:37.52]There's not much to see anyways, so... Alright, I'm just gonna leave.
[96:55.75]Yep.
[96:56.41]Time to go.
[96:56.81]He's too strong, this man will come on.
[97:07.50]We are out of here.
[97:09.64]My house also burst in half.
[97:14.02]Everything here just bursts.
[97:18.72]This person's freaking me out.
[97:19.86]I think they're going to get up and chase me and shit.
[97:23.71]There's going to be a scenario where I should have just killed him.
[97:28.53]Hey, you here?
[97:30.53]Are you good?
[97:32.47]Kill me.
[97:36.28]And take my house.
[97:40.56]My cracked hut.
[97:49.97]Where do you live?
[97:50.51]Where do you live?
[97:51.15]Where do you live?
[97:52.51]Oh no.
[97:53.09]Where do you live?
[97:53.77]Okay.
[98:00.63]Rusty key.
[98:06.12]Like, where?
[98:06.78]I don't know where you live.
[98:53.11]Oh, these mushrooms rotted because I took too long in here.
[98:55.63]Fuck.
[98:56.59]Are they worth anything?
[98:58.72]I got an axe.
[99:00.88]How does it swing?
[99:02.68]Pretty nicely.
[99:04.32]Ooh, pretty nice, actually.
[99:05.68]I don't even need to build the damn thing.
[99:09.35]I have an axe head.
[99:10.11]I can just sell it back.
[99:18.72]Oh, I can upgrade the axe!
[99:20.36]Holy shit.
[99:21.68]Now this is getting interesting.
[99:27.30]This thing's gonna be insane.
[99:35.84]Hell yeah.
[99:37.69]Alright, so I got... Let me look at this.
[99:40.74]So I have the doctor's hideout.
[99:41.74]Go back to the tub.
[99:42.16]Check tub.
[99:42.50]Under the tub.
[100:10.99]Check under the tub.
[100:20.00]Rub a dub dub.
[100:26.87]What's under the tub?
[100:41.60]You guys are supposed to be helping me.
[100:42.60]This is what I think of your little tub joke.
[100:54.19]I didn't break the tub.
[100:55.25]I broke the door.
[100:59.24]And almost destroyed the shovel.
[101:06.88]mean chat well sorry it's look sometimes I look over here and it's like holy read chat you stupid idiot you're so stupid how could you not do this and then that's it's a lie but other times I can't see the word going on the screen so it's it's hard to determine
[101:39.49]Like, he's blind.
[101:41.11]He's an idiot.
[101:42.57]Oh, the word was going not good if you just read it.
[101:46.24]But then you guys can, because I know I do that, you guys can get me so easily with shit like that.
[101:52.16]Let's put it this way.
[101:55.88]You were, you were, you guys are a coin flip if you're legit or not.
[102:02.96]Why is it, why did the time change?
[102:04.07]Alright.
[102:05.62]Where the hell am I?
[102:08.50]Where am I?
[102:11.14]Where did I just end up?
[102:11.82]Okay, right here.
[102:13.56]Back to the house.
[102:15.92]I'm not... No, no, no.
[102:17.44]Gun.
[102:17.84]I don't care.
[102:18.20]Give me the gun!
[102:22.73]That didn't hit.
[102:23.79]That's a pretty good dodge, I'll tell you.
[102:27.89]But I don't have time.
[102:29.83]Rotten mushroom's not worth anything, right?
[102:31.19]Yes, I know.
[102:45.69]It was a good dodge.
[102:49.19]Stupid, bald, man-lit idiot.
[102:52.33]Why are you guys so mean?
[102:57.97]Alright, imagine, okay.
[103:03.09]Imagine if every time somebody said something in this chat that was, like, even remotely... Anything.
[103:09.47]You could say anything.
[103:10.43]Imagine if I referred to some of you guys as, oh, hey.
[103:14.06]Hey, what's up, you bald, man-lit idiot?
[103:17.52]How you guys doing today?
[103:19.22]You're all bald, man-lit morons.
[103:21.30]How you guys doing?
[103:24.00]Don't you think you'd kind of be like, hey!
[103:29.47]Hey!
[103:31.27]What?
[103:31.77]What?
[103:32.81]That was a little rude.
[103:34.17]Alright, I'm gonna fuck this up.
[103:41.44]Just go down.
[103:42.00]I'm out of gas.
[103:47.64]Just keep the gun out.
[103:51.18]He's yelling at... No, I'm not.
[103:53.49]Sometimes I think it's funny.
[103:54.37]Which is why I kept the gun out.
[104:02.16]Let me try the axe.
[104:02.82]Imagine you went to work.
[104:11.49]And your boss greets you at the door.
[104:13.45]At the door.
[104:15.73]Okay, I don't want to die.
[104:21.42]Guys, I'm gonna die!
[104:22.38]I'm dead.
[104:25.00]There's fucking three dogs here.
[104:32.75]Again, two of you came out of nowhere.
[104:35.01]Two people from chat.
[104:37.76]Why are these open?
[104:41.22]Why are these open?
[104:42.52]Why are these undone?
[104:51.15]What the fuck happened?
[104:54.32]I'm sorry.
[104:54.74]Yeah, two dogs just literally just spawned out of nowhere and a third one came and killed me.
[105:00.97]Why are these open?
[105:02.69]This is horrible, actually.
[105:04.41]This is terrible.
[105:08.87]This is awful.
[105:09.59]Why are these open?
[105:10.19]Why are these... I don't understand why these have been done.
[105:13.16]Did somebody come in here?
[105:18.46]What I was gonna say is imagine you, like, went into work and you boss the first thing in the morning.
[105:24.88]I'm gonna pause it for this.
[105:25.96]You walk in.
[105:26.70]Oh, hey.
[105:27.54]Oh, hey.
[105:27.84]Hey, boss.
[105:28.72]Hey, you bald, man-lit idiot.
[105:33.50]That motherfucker is getting sued for, like, harassment.
[105:40.63]Can you imagine that, like, instant lawsuit?
[105:46.77]It'd be fucking immediate.
[105:50.09]Did I lose my rifle?
[105:51.49]Oh, I'm gonna do everything possible to get that back.
[105:58.68]No, I still have it.
[105:59.30]Okay, I'm gonna get my stuff though.
[106:10.41]Why would those traps open?
[106:14.73]That's a bug.
[106:17.07]Alright, get rid of this shit.
[106:22.50]I can't even use this stuff anymore.
[106:25.35]Store the hunting rifle for now.
[106:27.75]I need battery.
[106:28.69]Store the scrap metal.
[106:32.90]That sucks.
[106:33.96]Why is it... Why did it do that?
[106:35.54]That's actually aggravating.
[106:39.00]I died, so it activated two of my traps.
[106:42.71]Alright.
[106:43.87]Oh, fuck off.
[106:45.21]I don't... I am not ready to take off this stuff right now.
[106:54.51]I don't have time for this.
[106:55.35]I have to go get my stuff.
[106:57.63]Did he come in here and step on the traps?
[107:26.22]I don't have time for this shit.
[107:28.75]Every single individual item needs to be... Ration stamps.
[107:34.45]What the fuck is this?
[107:50.58]Give me a break.
[107:51.44]I have no idea what to do here.
[107:53.54]Take these.
[107:54.58]Put them here.
[107:55.10]I'm going to take the gas out.
[107:59.16]Put the shovel back.
[108:02.36]Nails.
[108:02.80]I mean, just combine them.
[108:04.62]Why are they not auto-combined?
[108:07.04]What the hell?
[108:11.26]Anything else?
[108:11.86]Get rid of these bottles.
[108:12.74]I don't even know what this rear view mirror is for.
[108:15.96]I'm afraid to delete any of these items.
[108:17.43]I feel like I'm going to need them.
[108:19.43]Where are those?
[108:21.41]Take one of these.
[108:23.45]Take these bottles out.
[108:32.67]Make a few more healing things.
[108:39.77]What?
[108:41.68]What?!
[108:46.88]Use the auto combine key.
[108:50.76]Phone on me.
[108:53.75]I'm gonna throw this off a cliff.
[108:56.25]I'm literally throwing this off a cliff the next cliff I come to.
[109:00.33]This thing is going- I'm going to throw this as fucking hard as I can over the horizon.
[109:10.20]Okay.
[109:13.50]Torch.
[109:14.12]I'm just gonna bring it.
[109:16.30]Can't combine that.
[109:20.81]This rotten meat is useless.
[109:22.35]I'm gonna cook this stuff right now.
[109:25.05]I can't believe that those traps aren't there.
[109:26.57]There's still one.
[109:30.15]Alright, let's go.
[109:51.10]Oh shit, okay.
[109:52.60]I can make like gas bombs?
[109:57.42]That's pretty ridiculous.
[110:01.42]Metal pipe.
[110:03.02]I'll take the bottles with me.
[110:04.36]Whipping this off the cliff as hard as I can.
[110:07.18]And let's do another lockpick.
[110:13.03]Here we go.
[110:14.19]Let's do bear trap.
[110:21.54]Upgrade item.
[110:22.42]Let me look at this.
[110:25.73]I need 8 scrap for a greatly increased weapon durability.
[110:29.41]That scared the shit out of me.
[110:31.87]Holy fuck.
[110:34.13]Why is that so much louder than the game?
[110:35.51]Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[110:45.62]Store this for now.
[110:46.46]I need to go get my stuff before it gets too late.
[110:53.31]Alright, I have... Where's my axe?
[111:01.08]No.
[111:01.58]Oh my fucking god.
[111:03.22]That's fine.
[111:04.56]Alright, get me the fuck out of here.
[111:05.64]I gotta get my stuff.
[111:07.12]It's right next to the house.
[111:09.68]I can't believe I died there.
[111:12.11]Uh, hold on.
[111:17.45]Fucking full moon.
[111:18.69]This has been a full moon chat the last three days.
[111:24.84]Have you guys been drinking shit under the sink?
[111:27.40]What are you doing?
[111:35.29]Alright, don't, I can't fuck this, I need my stuff.
[111:41.23]I, I know, I'm gonna get to those bits, but I, it's 15 o'clock right now and I can't fuck this up.
[111:51.23]I don't even remember where the hell that was.
[111:54.15]Oh, you piece of shit.
[111:55.87]You are so...
[111:57.51]What?!
[111:57.83]Fucking hell.
[111:58.47]Where's my bag?
[112:23.55]Crate?
[112:25.85]No, there's... No!
[112:29.27]I just found my stuff.
[112:30.33]Does anybody remember where it was?
[112:39.90]It was like over here somewhere, right?
[112:45.40]What?
[112:45.88]I don't have time for you.
[112:47.88]Somebody can't... I don't have time for you.
[112:52.10]It's under the tub.
[113:06.87]Where's that?
[113:08.11]There it is.
[113:12.24]I got no bullets.
[113:13.20]This is a horrendous scenario.
[113:26.42]Leave.
[113:26.88]Leave.
[113:27.48]Leave.
[113:28.04]Leave.
[113:28.61]Leave.
[113:29.45]Leave.
[113:30.23]Leave.
[113:36.56]I made it.
[113:36.94]Oh fuck!
[113:52.05]You guys are fucking with me.
[113:53.47]You guys are like fucking with my head.
[113:59.06]Alright.
[114:02.44]You broke him.
[114:04.17]Alright, 5,000 bits came in.
[114:07.67]From Phylactery Lich.
[114:10.27]Thank you, first of all.
[114:13.21]That moment's going to be forever remembered because you have a facecam.
[114:16.90]It's alright, it don't matter.
[114:18.64]Hey Jerma, I'm glad you're streaming because I had a pretty bad day at work today.
[114:22.10]I got to work and said, hey boss, and he called me a bald, man-lit idiot.
[114:26.08]It really hurt my feelings.
[114:27.42]Do you think I have a case for harassment?
[114:34.81]Yes!
[114:35.99]Yes, absolutely!
[114:37.35]100%!
[114:38.03]Oh my god, you guys are fucking too much.
[114:56.48]Thank you for the 5,000 bits.
[115:00.06]Oh wait, I forgot, I have to do this before it becomes too dark out.
[115:05.71]I have it in my inventory, right?
[115:07.39]Yeah.
[115:08.01]Get it out of here.
[115:12.67]Watch this.
[115:15.15]I'm just gonna whip this shit into the woods.
[115:21.45]Here.
[115:22.75]Oh, what's that?
[115:23.39]Something's gonna chase me.
[115:40.42]It's a body of precious bone.
[115:54.79]Okay, 17 o'clock.
[115:57.35]Ugh, look at this.
[115:57.99]This is such a mess.
[115:59.89]This is a mess in here.
[116:07.83]I'm just gonna make these until I can't make them anymore.
[116:09.65]I have, like, toxic fumes now.
[116:14.31]Okay.
[116:15.39]I'm gonna make these.
[116:21.27]Bear trap?
[116:21.93]I can only make one bear trap.
[116:23.53]This sucks.
[116:25.82]What a disaster.
[116:28.62]What a disaster.
[116:32.72]I have healing here.
[116:34.30]Don't need the lockpicks right now.
[116:37.17]I'll do this tomorrow.
[116:38.63]I need to repair.
[116:39.53]I can't repair this.
[116:41.79]I need two scrap.
[116:44.03]Not good.
[116:44.47]That's alright.
[116:45.73]I don't have any bullets either.
[116:47.37]Yes, I do.
[116:48.02]I have one.
[116:48.64]I'm going to piss my pants.
[116:50.58]Okay.
[116:57.74]Where's my wood?
[116:58.30]Make sure everything's boarded up.
[117:01.54]Get these bottles out of here.
[117:04.93]Uh...
[117:07.96]I'll reorganize this shit tomorrow.
[117:09.88]I just don't... I don't know what to do with it all.
[117:13.80]I'm gonna fill the generator.
[117:15.00]I've got my axe and I have a full clip.
[117:17.28]And now that has to last me.
[117:18.68]That has to last me till tomorrow.
[117:19.86]That's just all there is to it.
[117:21.34]Let's go.
[117:21.66]It's like, can I cook anything else?
[117:29.03]No.
[117:31.29]Chad is a vicious mob.
[117:38.62]No, I'm telling you, people don't think the full moon shit is real.
[117:52.51]It's not.
[117:55.01]You sure?
[117:55.47]What time is it where you are?
[117:57.51]Look out the window.
[117:58.15]If there's a full moon, and, okay, if you look out the window and there's a full moon and the last sentence you wrote in chat was like, pee-pee-poople-bald-mad-streamer,
[118:13.11]I'm just saying.
[118:14.11]It might have something to do with it.
[118:19.51]I need to move.
[118:20.47]Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[118:21.87]I need to board.
[118:22.71]I don't have time for this.
[118:25.42]Oh, I'm so fucking screwed here.
[118:37.05]That's at least closed.
[118:38.25]I'm not in the room though.
[118:39.45]I'm not in the room.
[118:40.53]I have to get in the room.
[118:42.43]Get in the room.
[118:44.35]19.
[118:44.85]Ow!
[118:45.13]My hand.
[118:53.62]Good.
[118:54.44]This is blocked.
[118:55.32]There's a trap there already.
[118:58.00]Close this door.
[118:59.49]Board it!
[119:04.85]Okay.
[119:07.99]This trap is going right here.
[119:10.85]Right, like, in front of me.
[119:14.49]Like, right... Because if somebody comes in this way, they'll get hit by it.
[119:16.87]If somebody comes in this way... I don't know.
[119:19.15]Is this way?
[119:19.63]I don't know.
[119:20.69]I don't know.
[119:21.29]I don't know.
[119:21.83]I don't know.
[119:22.33]I don't know where to put this.
[119:25.80]Should I put it right here?
[119:54.42]Not yet.
[119:55.60]I have the scream still.
[119:58.46]You look strange today.
[120:04.13]Come on into work.
[120:04.67]How are you?
[120:05.25]Good to see you again.
[120:05.95]Good to see you again, Dick.
[120:07.27]You look strange today.
[120:09.67]Okay.
[120:10.45]Bald.
[120:10.95]Idiot.
[120:13.21]I'm gonna go to my desk.
[120:14.41]Yeah.
[120:16.09]Idiot.
[120:18.73]I can see your bald head.
[120:22.05]I can hear him still screaming.
[120:24.24]And he's just sittin' there.
[120:24.92]He's sittin' there with, like, like, under the sink, cleaner in his hand!
[120:30.21]Bald!
[120:33.21]Whoa!
[120:34.13]This is fucked up!
[120:35.85]And then he goes, a-woo!
[120:42.59]Cause there's a fuckin' full moon behind him.
[120:46.51]Okay, I don't wanna die.
[120:48.43]I don't wanna die.
[121:11.19]It's only been one hour.
[121:26.88]Can't do it.
[121:27.90]You can't do it.
[121:29.60]Uh-oh.
[121:32.30]I got good dental.
[121:46.40]What's that sound?
[121:47.90]Oh, no, don't put the gas in here.
[121:51.50]Don't put it right under me.
[121:53.73]Don't put it right under me.
[121:55.29]If you put it right under me, I'm gonna lose.
[122:07.78]The dog is just, like, smashing his head.
[122:11.82]Eventually, maybe you'll get it.
[122:21.09]Um, what happens if the ghosts come and turn the light off?
[122:24.89]What the fuck?
[122:33.56]What's that?
[122:35.34]Why is there a nuke in the house?
[122:37.64]Why is there a nuke in the house?
[122:39.42]I don't know what that is.
[122:41.45]What does that mean?
[122:44.75]Why is there a nuke in the house?
[122:48.68]Where is it and what is it?
[122:50.60]Something's trying to move this container.
[122:53.86]And... It has- It's not successful yet.
[122:58.03]Hello?
[122:59.15]What is in the house?!
[123:03.17]What is in the house?!
[123:04.87]I need to heal.
[123:11.78]I need to heal!
[123:17.09]If this motherfucker moves around the house... Get out of that room!
[123:25.65]Get out of that room!
[123:27.47]It's trapped!
[123:28.17]No, no, move the... Move the pre-hero, please.
[123:31.83]It's 5.30, it's almost time.
[123:32.55]Come on, it's almost time for work, Trevor!
[123:45.92]What the fuck was that?
[123:46.72]My house just shook.
[124:17.12]I was trying to go around this way.
[124:20.00]No.
[124:54.64]I got halfway through that awoo, and I realized... STOP!
[124:58.70]That's what happened to my brain.
[125:00.74]In my mind, it was... I got halfway through, and my brain went, STOP!
[125:06.19]Don't do that!
[125:06.91]Stop it!
[125:17.41]I wanna see that clip.
[125:19.66]I wanna see how fucking embarrassing that was.
[125:22.62]I need to know.
[125:23.04]This is why I don't do facecam.
[125:27.03]It's like turd alert is coming up here.
[125:45.14]That wasn't even it.
[125:49.41]That sounds like a baby?
[125:52.49]That sounds like a baby.
[125:56.32]This is not it.
[125:57.24]Leave.
[125:57.78]Leave.
[125:58.34]Leave.
[125:58.56]What the fuck are you licking this for?
[126:04.52]This sounds like a baby.
[126:10.39]Fuck, that's... God damn it, I hate it.
[126:17.21]I hate it.
[126:17.87]I hate this.
[126:19.95]I hate this.
[126:22.39]Oh, I hate this.
[126:24.10]This image over here.
[126:28.20]Oh, I hate this.
[126:31.12]I'm never streaming again.
[126:32.92]This is the last stream ever.
[126:34.96]I'm going to go hide for the rest of my life.
[126:45.83]Got fired.
[126:46.47]Alright, let's keep going.
[126:56.62]Turn off the generator.
[126:57.50]I made it.
[126:59.26]I made it.
[127:02.91]But give me a little bit of slack.
[127:06.01]I don't know what that thing was.
[127:09.17]This red sun glowing nuclear bomb just appeared in my room.
[127:14.80]I'm gonna panic a little.
[127:16.08]I don't know what that is.
[127:22.56]Imagine ending your career by a wooing.
[127:30.63]That really is the last thing I would do.
[127:33.77]No, we got a Halloween stream to do.
[127:35.03]That's not gonna happen.
[127:41.28]Alright.
[127:45.96]Train wreck.
[127:49.02]I had a note to go to the train wreck.
[128:00.14]Anything cool planned for Halloween this year?
[128:01.46]Yeah.
[128:02.50]There's going to be an incredibly elaborate stream.
[128:05.02]Me versus you.
[128:06.24]Secret slime actions.
[128:07.28]You're going to try to slime me by... I'll go over it again at the end of the stream.
[128:10.31]It's going to be a whole thing.
[128:13.11]Oh, that's right.
[128:13.71]A bunch of people are here.
[128:16.47]Long story short, there's going to be a channel in the Discord that's going to be opened up for you to give suggestions on secret slime actions from me that I do not know about.
[128:23.73]There's going to be a discussion channel and there's going to be a suggestion channel.
[128:26.60]Discussion channels for discussion, suggestions for one sentence on what you think it should be.
[128:30.08]Bingo.
[128:30.68]No discussion in that channel.
[128:32.18]By the way, October 31st, that's when it's probably going to happen.
[128:35.68]The 30th, 31st, one of those days.
[128:36.96]I'll give you a good hard concrete one.
[128:38.89]But me versus you, you also have slime actions as well because we're going to come up with some stuff that you're not allowed to write in the chat.
[128:45.41]And it's a competition, because if you write something that you're not supposed to write and you don't know about, then you are banned from that game and you lose points as a collective chat.
[128:53.46]Boom.
[129:02.49]A wooing is going to be on there.
[129:03.53]That's fine.
[129:04.27]I'll never do that again.
[129:06.11]This is the first and last time you will ever see me or hear me do that.
[129:08.69]Do not suggest the awoo as a thing to do on that stream because it will never happen again.
[129:15.55]I promise.
[129:17.89]I 100% guarantee you that I will never turn and do the cookie crisp howl.
[129:25.62]Because that's what it's in my head.
[129:28.40]Every time I've gone, mmm, the thing, I'm just thinking of Cookie Crisp.
[129:33.96]Every time.
[129:34.80]I've done it, like, probably ten times in my life.
[129:42.27]You still have to spin.
[129:43.41]I did!
[129:44.61]You didn't see me go around in a circle?
[129:51.61]Do it again.
[129:52.05]No.
[129:56.01]Okay.
[129:56.83]Okay, okay.
[129:57.65]I got all the time in the world now.
[130:00.19]I need to get this set up.
[130:04.50]So, first things first.
[130:06.94]There are nuclear bombs now.
[130:08.84]Good to know.
[130:10.14]Second things first.
[130:11.68]Go to the trader.
[130:13.98]Third thing is second.
[130:15.60]Sell the items that I want to get rid of.
[130:17.08]Okay.
[130:26.09]Always pick up the items that I know I need, that I want.
[130:29.14]And that includes rags, wood, battery, magazine, mushroom, medium caliber bullet.
[130:45.39]Right?
[130:53.90]That's for the rifle, right?
[130:59.24]He shakes his head.
[131:00.06]Why not?
[131:00.50]Oh.
[131:00.62]Because he wants something in return.
[131:04.68]These things are worth a lot of money.
[131:05.60]Uh, I don't know.
[131:07.48]Should I give you an odd stone?
[131:08.84]These do anything?
[131:10.75]Don't ignore jermaWoo.
[131:12.57]Well, I'm going to ignore it, because I...
[131:25.53]Just didn't ignore.
[131:26.73]Alright.
[131:27.45]So... Don't give the stone.
[131:30.53]Guys!
[131:32.14]Here, you can have a few eggs.
[131:35.32]No, that's too many eggs.
[131:36.16]You can have, like, one.
[131:39.82]Here.
[131:41.04]You know it's okay.
[131:42.99]So let's do a little bit of a thing here.
[131:44.79]Let me go.
[131:45.41]I'm time for a true... Get rid of the shit that you don't need.

[134:55.31]Maybe.
[134:56.67]I need to get these scissors for whatever they are.
[135:01.21]Toy.
[135:04.50]Okay, flip.
[135:05.68]This is where we really just dump everything.
[135:09.62]I'm like 15 to 20 minutes to complete in the game, so... Toy.
[135:16.67]Sell.
[135:20.95]Okay.
[135:22.07]Welder.
[135:23.37]Sell.
[135:25.02]Wedding ring sell it Torch sell it Chicken head sell it Welder sell it Okay
[136:00.60]Dermot, there are two chapters.
[136:01.72]You're in chapter one.
[136:06.92]Well written.
[136:09.95]Acid just got in my eyes.
[136:13.63]Welder.
[136:14.05]Welder.
[136:15.17]Wedding ring.
[136:15.79]$50.
[136:16.09]You should play Hitman some more.
[136:21.27]Says PhylacteryLich with 5,000 bits.
[136:23.53]Play Hitman some more.
[136:24.93]I actually did see this gift today of the flying helicopter briefcase on the guy with the... I have seen this.
[136:32.17]It's a fucking lot of money.
[136:33.99]That's $100 now from Phylactery.
[136:35.77]Holy shit.
[136:36.69]You're still giving money?
[136:40.31]Devs never intended a player to take this many days.
[136:42.51]Well, that's funny because I just was curious and looked up how many days typical did people have when they did their first blind playthrough.
[136:49.97]And typically speaking, it's like 30 to 40 days is what I've seen.
[136:53.49]So I just had a legit research project that could back that up.
[136:58.21]You should make about 30 plus days for your first playthrough is what I've been told.
[137:02.33]I don't appreciate that, by the way.
[137:05.13]I howl at people that do stuff like that.
[137:11.84]You don't want the toy.
[137:13.70]But, File Factory, thank you so much.
[137:15.02]Hitman is done, though.
[137:16.10]Unfortunately.
[137:17.28]I think I got everything I wanted out of it.
[137:19.76]It's a fantastic fucking game.
[137:22.58]I love every second of that game.
[137:25.66]But I'm not going to be playing Hitman 2 anymore.
[137:29.65]I've done it all.
[137:32.41]I'm gonna... Okay.
[137:34.27]So that should be good.
[137:35.19]Give me your scrap metal.
[137:37.91]I want to upgrade this axe blade, but...
[137:46.50]Can I do another upgrade here?
[137:50.12]Might be possible.
[137:54.17]I gotta go back in my inventory.
[138:00.81]Play Blood Money.
[138:02.33]Well, I mean, I could play some of the old ones, but... Not at the moment.
[138:06.42]Not right now.
[138:07.50]Alright, back down here.
[138:13.78]The Axe.
[138:15.49]The axe needs axe head and four more scrap to do the big upgrade.
[138:23.24]Which I think I'll probably be taking that to the end of the game, if I were curious.
[138:28.78]Shovel?
[138:29.18]I think it's time for the shovel to leave.
[138:30.64]I think the shovel's time is up.
[138:41.19]It was really good.
[138:42.19]It helped.
[138:44.98]Goodbye, shovel.
[138:46.86]Thank you for everything.
[138:47.98]Thank you for everything.
[138:51.90]I'll make another one of these.
[139:01.13]Homemade shotgun.
[139:02.03]Don't I have a shotgun?
[139:05.25]I do.
[139:07.74]Useless after firing.
[139:08.64]I need to use this on something.
[139:10.98]I don't know what the hell to use it on.
[139:12.50]Alright, so we got... Take the wood out.
[139:14.58]Put the nails back.
[139:17.38]Take the lockpicks out.
[139:18.54]Put these shiny stones in.
[139:20.60]The bottles do not have a purpose for me anymore.
[139:24.64]What's the difference between the heal pills and just the regular pills?
[139:29.21]What do these do?
[139:35.67]Do these do anything?
[139:41.19]This is for stamina.
[139:42.63]Okay, well, I'm just gonna... I'm gonna burn through them.
[139:45.75]Toy, I can't do anything with it yet.
[139:47.29]Battery, I can't do anything with it.
[139:49.41]Is bat- I feel like battery- I already did what I needed with the battery.
[139:51.99]Do I need to keep it?
[139:52.90]I'm gonna sell the flares.
[139:57.86]Bottle of gas, which stacks a three.
[140:00.50]Unfortunately, yes.
[140:04.28]Rearview mirror, like, these things... I don't- they're not- they don't have a purpose anymore.
[140:14.34]And these are heals.
[140:15.96]So I'll take a couple of these.
[140:17.00]One of these with me.
[140:18.88]Okay.
[140:25.02]Stacks of two.
[140:26.66]Bring the clip with me.
[140:28.24]Put the rope back here.
[140:29.30]I have... Where's my hunting rifle?
[140:32.87]The new one.
[140:33.49]Where is it?
[140:36.27]Where is it?
[140:36.65]Where's the rifle?
[140:41.91]Where's the rifle?
[140:46.58]Where's the rifle?
[140:47.08]There it is.
[140:48.54]Looks like a toothbrush.
[140:49.46]Alright, I'm going to keep the bullet with the rifle.
[140:53.49]I'm not going to use it yet.
[140:54.37]I feel like I'm going to need that endgame.
[140:57.97]Weapons are supposed to go up top.
[141:00.93]Batteries I need to take for the flashlight.
[141:04.64]I'll eat the eggs on this trip.
[141:06.12]I have heals.
[141:07.88]Bottle, get rid of.
[141:08.62]Alright.
[141:09.80]Somebody stop me.
[141:11.51]Somebody stop me right now.
[141:12.85]What is selling is getting rid of the mirror.
[141:16.55]He doesn't want any of it.
[141:17.39]Okay.
[141:24.56]Alright.
[141:30.75]I have my axe.
[141:31.61]I have 50%.
[141:32.19]I have a clip.
[141:32.95]Alright, let's go back down one more time.
[141:34.87]Let me turn these into wooden planks.
[141:39.77]Do I have any gas?
[141:40.93]I might buy another gas because I'm probably... I'm going to fill it up.
[141:44.05]Let's fill it up, the whole thing.
[141:46.93]I've got three batteries.
[141:47.85]Good.
[141:48.09]I'll come back and... Okay.
[141:55.88]Okay.
[141:57.94]I forgot to pee.
[141:59.18]I had to go really bad.
[142:00.10]It's okay.
[142:00.72]I can wait.
[142:01.30]Alright, let me bring the gas.
[142:15.13]Go to the bathroom now.
[142:16.55]I will before I go out for the next adventure.
[142:24.03]Let's... I'm so sorry.
[142:25.91]I just smashed you in the head.
[142:40.08]I'm gonna do a full tank in here and fill up the generator over here as well.
[142:46.05]And then I'm gonna buy a gas can from Mr. Trader over here.
[143:03.89]I'm going to cook right now.
[143:07.54]I am so happy that they decided that this game was going to not have a time go right now.
[143:14.56]If the timer was going on right now, this would be horrible.
[143:21.57]It would be so horrible.
[143:25.89]Pee?
[143:26.15]I'll pee, like, tomorrow.
[143:37.01]Alright, we're good.
[143:39.09]Let's go back and put the gas in.
[143:43.98]He's going to have to do the a-woo during the green screen stream.
[143:47.04]That is the only other place that I will do it.
[143:49.82]Because that's not... Yeah.
[143:52.42]I will do that again.
[143:53.48]A full... Like, a full cookie crisp.
[143:58.53]I promise.
[143:59.27]And I'm going to do it as hard as I can.
[144:00.69]Alright, how much is this? 68...
[144:06.83]yeah let's buy one take these bottles okay alright back to what I was just doing don't give us this kind of power well those of you that were not here the last time I did this
[144:32.59]How that stream works, and how that, this whole thing is gonna work, is... I, you are going to put, if you want to participate, you're gonna put suggestions on what you want me to do in front of a full, like, hundred, like, fifty foot long, and like, hundred foot tall green screen.
[144:55.61]Anything.
[144:55.91]It could be anything.
[144:58.29]So, when people are talking about doing Awu in front of a green screen, like, that's what they're referring to.
[145:04.10]And then everybody makes this shit.
[145:06.02]They spend... Why am I here?
[145:09.79]Uh, they spend a bunch of time and a bunch of talent.
[145:13.75]Very talented people in this community make very, very interesting things from those green screen clips.
[145:25.64]Alright, what was I doing here?
[145:26.84]Right, wood.
[145:27.40]I got this.
[145:29.98]Ten.
[145:30.58]Okay, I gotta organize for a second.
[145:34.29]Scrap metal can go back.
[145:37.89]Pills are gonna stay here.
[145:38.79]I'm gonna eat these.
[145:40.53]This is for health.
[145:42.72]Battery.
[145:43.18]I don't know what the fuck to do with this stuff.
[145:48.18]I already have three.
[145:52.65]Lockpicks.
[145:53.83]Alright, I think my inventory's good to go.
[145:56.33]I'm gonna do this just so my brain understands.
[145:59.18]Right?
[145:59.72]I need my brain to know what this shit is here for.
[146:03.50]Right?
[146:03.80]So it's gonna be whatever is in the slot, that row is gonna be related to that.
[146:08.76]So for instance, axe.
[146:10.51]First row, we've got I don't know, lockpick and watch.
[146:15.61]Because that's like you've stuck your hold and it's on your hands.
[146:18.89]Battery and
[146:24.66]Don't matter.
[146:26.44]Could be anything.
[146:27.10]Battery and meat.
[146:29.32]Gun?
[146:31.24]Um, I guess... Uh... That system doesn't work.
[146:35.83]So I'm just gonna... Who cares?
[146:38.83]Alright, I'm ready.
[146:41.51]I need... Four more scrap.
[146:44.61]Make sure I get some.
[146:47.03]I'm ready to go.
[146:48.69]The thing I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna go from here.
[146:50.37]I have to go to this train wreck.
[146:55.82]Dermot, wake up now.
[146:57.62]I'll be alright.
[147:01.14]Put the pill in the hotbar.
[147:02.42]You know, that's what I'm glad to have you guys around.
[147:06.48]Because that just frees up space.
[147:09.34]And that's a heal, that's a stamina.
[147:12.30]This is why I make sure that I have some fucking smart people around me.
[147:16.41]Surrounded by them.
[147:18.97]I mean, you're not surrounding me.
[147:20.97]There's a ton of you who are just locked in a cube right here.
[147:25.62]And I can just look over there.
[147:28.22]So, I'm not technically surrounded.
[147:29.84]Alright, time- I gotta pee.
[147:33.91]I will do that.
[147:34.37]I'll be right back.

[152:28.90]Not rocks, because they don't... I hate them.
[152:34.08]Is this the same shit that I wore last time?
[152:38.04]No, this is like purple V-neck.
[152:39.40]I didn't wear this.
[152:41.30]No?
[152:45.67]Holy shit, this flashlight is amazing.
[152:47.45]Why did I not take this?
[152:49.76]Alright, train wreck.

[155:14.99]I just watched Rhino look at what it does!
[155:18.40]And how long it's gone for!
[155:21.62]Oh, I hate it!
[155:23.12]Why did I do this?
[155:34.48]Turns out that was a terrible idea.
[155:46.67]I wanted to see how long it stayed on you for, and while I'm doing that, I'm moving this way.
[155:51.75]Oh, for the love of God.
[155:54.65]Hopefully there's not two of those in here.
[155:57.66]There probably is.
[156:01.22]I hear gurgling sounds.
[156:18.96]Duffed links.
[156:21.16]Can't- wait, what?
[156:21.71]There's nothing here?
[156:27.13]Don't!

[157:19.19]Holy shit, he's alive still!
[157:23.09]Okay, take the gun out.
[157:23.97]I didn't know.
[157:31.95]I didn't know.
[157:32.39]What's this?
[157:35.75]A photo of a dog.
[157:37.81]Eating something.
[157:39.17]In a magazine.
[157:46.87]I can't really use the axe anymore.
[157:48.13]One more hit of the axe and it's gonna be destroyed.
[157:57.60]Start using moisturizer.
[158:01.80]I do every single day.
[158:06.20]I'm not gonna read any more of those.
[158:12.39]Can I move this?
[158:18.09]Something is still like clicking and clacking.
[158:36.76]Oh, I can make armor again.
[158:39.55]Wait, let me see.
[158:40.09]Let me change what I got on.
[158:44.11]Forget about it.
[158:44.53]Who cares about the wire?
[158:47.21]I can make armor.
[158:52.80]No, it's fine.
[158:53.92]It's alright.
[158:54.84]Alright, anything else back here?
[159:00.85]No.
[159:01.01]I think I've looted this whole house.
[159:06.34]There's a place to go to the right.
[159:08.08]Have I gone over here?
[159:08.87]Let me just check this.
[159:12.73]No, I have not gone this way.
[159:17.01]And this is blocked.
[159:17.75]I can't move it, so I have to go up and around.
[159:21.25]But there's flax.
[159:32.52]What the hell is making... There's a lot of traps in here.
[159:36.36]What is making that noise?
[159:42.11]What the fuck?
[159:42.73]There's so many traps right here.
[159:49.91]Wow.
[159:52.75]No room in inventory.
[159:53.89]Well, that has to change.
[159:59.02]Get rid of the... I don't know, the... The nails?
[160:05.04]The wood.
[160:13.95]Search the traps.
[160:16.15]This is everything I wanted.
[160:17.95]I'm getting rid of the eggs.
[160:38.20]Eggs and alcohol.
[160:39.81]Eggs and nails.
[160:51.83]I'm so glad I came in here.
[160:52.71]This is the exact thing I needed.
[160:55.77]A bunch of scrap and traps.
[161:02.39]Is it all in good fun?
[161:03.12]I hope he doesn't take it to heart.
[161:05.06]No, no.
[161:05.80]I'm just fucking around.
[161:06.52]We're just messing around.
[161:09.94]That's what we do here.
[161:15.06]He's sad.
[161:15.79]What?
[161:18.05]Now we're not messing around.
[161:19.15]That's how you get me.
[161:29.67]That's interesting.
[161:32.69]Another wedding ring.
[161:39.57]I don't want this.
[161:42.03]It's not worth taking.
[161:49.56]50 bucks versus 225.
[161:51.16]There's nothing here I want to get rid of.
[161:59.93]Somebody remember that's here.
[162:00.85]Hello.
[162:07.99]Is somebody in this... this bunker thing over here?
[162:24.09]What about like under?
[162:24.99]Is somebody like in a basement or something?
[162:26.58]I don't see any way to get under.
[162:39.96]I mean, can I go around?
[162:41.44]No.
[162:43.74]Somebody's under here.
[163:04.49]Check the tub.
[163:06.67]After this I have to go home.
[163:08.77]But somebody's clearly clawing at something.
[163:11.11]I mean, like, right here?
[163:18.83]What is over here?
[163:22.87]No.
[163:28.69]Is it just creaky house, and the creaky house makes creaky house noises?
[163:34.81]I mean, there's... Look at this.
[163:36.04]There's something in here.
[163:39.71]Alright, I'm going back.
[163:40.39]I don't know.
[163:49.34]If I miss it, I miss it.
[163:54.12]I do have enough scrapping.
[163:56.08]Alright, we're just gonna go to the left.
[163:59.86]We'll go there tomorrow.
[164:04.71]Uh, it's time to eat pills to run.
[164:10.18]Watch out for the mushrooms.
[164:22.26]Straight across.

[164:27.23]No mushrooms.
[164:28.13]We're good.
[164:32.77]A few hours to get settled.
[164:37.45]Still logs if I need them.
[164:40.97]There's a lot of logs right outside my house here, so... Just go down from the house.

[165:38.14]This is still secure.
[165:39.34]There's a trap still up here.
[165:42.10]I gotta go to the workshop quickly before it gets too late.
[165:47.13]And I'm gonna do... First of all, we're gonna upgrade the axe to be Sturdy Blade.
[165:53.53]Greatly increased weapon durability.
[165:55.16]That's the axe head and a bunch of scrap.
[165:57.40]Make it.
[165:59.30]Beautiful.
[166:01.76]I can also do attacks that use less stamina.
[166:06.84]I'm gonna do that too.
[166:09.86]I do need to repair it.
[166:13.02]I'm gonna do that first.
[166:16.03]Okay.
[166:16.71]Upgrade.
[166:18.15]Light materials.
[166:20.63]Use less stamina for attacks.

[168:43.56]Boink!
[168:44.14]Okay.
[168:44.24]Okay.

[168:49.58]This is boarded.
[168:50.44]It's got full health.
[168:54.28]I just have to worry about the door.
[169:00.57]In fact, you know what?
[169:01.19]Like, I should really just do this to all the fucking doors and windows, shouldn't I?
[169:07.41]But it's too late.
[169:10.24]This is good.
[169:10.84]Alright, get this shit over here.
[169:25.75]Oh, come on.
[169:26.19]I don't have time for this shit.
[169:30.39]Like, get over here.
[169:31.11]Let's go.
[169:33.63]Whatever.
[169:34.14]That's fine.
[169:34.94]And then this... This is actually alright, too.
[169:38.26]I don't mind this.
[169:40.32]I don't mind this at all.
[169:41.34]Alright.
[169:42.14]Trap going down.
[169:48.65]This shit's going down.
[169:49.65]Right here.
[169:55.03]No.
[169:55.69]Yeah.
[169:56.07]Like right there.
[169:59.30]I trapped myself.
[170:00.72]Not yet.
[170:01.62]Because I'm going to do this.
[170:15.38]Something gets stuck there.
[170:17.38]I'm just gonna move this and smash it.
[170:25.57]Don't move.
[170:35.77]By the way, I got the rare one.
[170:37.41]Do you guys know these are rare?
[170:40.15]Did you know these are rare?
[170:49.88]I got a legendary cup.
[170:51.12]That's right.
[171:00.68]Fucking rays of death adder.
[171:03.04]This glued on piece of shit.
[171:04.48]I need a new mouse.
[171:16.62]Do you have to ask if somebody knows if something's rare?
[171:23.10]Get an Amazon basic mouse.
[171:24.28]You better believe it.
[171:26.12]Okay, here we go.
[171:31.15]In fact, I'm not going to mess around at all.
[171:34.77]Let's just go ahead and do this now.
[171:37.88]Because I know you're going to get in here.
[172:21.70]Here he comes.
[172:24.66]Here he comes.
[172:29.57]Here he comes.
[172:31.05]Here he comes.
[172:31.75]Okay, here he comes.
[172:34.35]Nope, that door still exists.
[173:27.27]Why did the dog not get in the trap when it came into the door?
[173:42.49]Why did it not trigger the trap?
[173:46.56]He just got in and just disappeared over here.
[174:20.06]Does dying at the house even matter?
[174:24.97]Yes, because you don't get the money.
[174:29.49]Unfortunately, you don't get the money.
[174:39.50]I would have had it too.
[174:40.30]It's just I... My thought process there was he was just breaking through the... He broke through the barricade.
[174:47.28]That's fine.
[174:48.48]But when he was breaking through the door, I just figured, I don't want to replace that door, so why not just open the door and let him walk in the trap.
[174:56.05]I opened the door, it got stuck on the fucking bureau.
[175:00.27]And then he teleported to the other side of the screen.
[175:03.07]And then I got in the trap.
[175:04.83]I got Wily Coyoted.
[175:08.02]Like the Roadrunner type shit.
[175:15.91]This happened, and then the game just made him go here.
[175:22.54]Whatever.
[175:23.98]I got a goal.
[175:24.88]And I have all my stuff on me.
[175:27.37]So I can just go.
[175:39.78]He jumped through the door.
[175:40.66]Well, I opened the door because I was trying to save time and not have to redo a doorway.
[175:46.48]It's alright.
[175:47.74]It don't matter.
[175:53.60]No, don't sell this stuff.
[175:54.69]I want to... I will... Actually, I'm going to level up here.
[176:01.39]All the necessary things that I want from you.
[176:03.61]I. I didn't get a chance to use my axe.
[176:06.33]I didn't get to swing it once.
[176:09.41]I'm going to buy another medium caliber bullet.
[176:12.61]A couple of rags.
[176:15.60]And that should be alright.
[176:18.08]No, I'm not going to buy the red egg.
[176:19.44]Oh, I do want a magazine though.
[176:28.99]Very nice.
[176:31.73]Spin.
[176:32.25]Now that was the deal for when I... No, that's not every trap.
[176:45.54]4,200.
[176:45.98]Here we go.
[176:46.78]Do I have to get to pick another one?
[176:51.92]Okay, I can pick appetite.
[176:53.30]I will restore my health by eating wood.
[176:58.17]I mean, that's... That's good.
[177:00.93]I'm gonna do that.
[177:04.25]Like, that's just good.
[177:05.15]The trap.
[177:06.75]Once a day, you won't trigger a trap.
[177:08.23]I know this is so much, for me, it's so much more useful, but still.
[177:13.62]Eating the wood thing is just health forever.
[177:16.82]No.
[177:17.44]Eat the wood.
[177:19.96]It's health forever.
[177:20.86]I can eat, I can, I never have to worry about health stuff.
[177:35.05]Where are we?
[177:35.51]Every time you... Okay, this is me, I think.
[177:48.74]Turn off the light.
[177:52.02]Oh, I don't... I want to sleep.
[177:53.16]Alright, fine.
[178:06.90]I don't want to go out yet.
[178:08.18]I need to wake up first.
[178:12.86]Am I not awake?
[178:14.50]Is this breakfast and egg stream?
[178:16.29]It's too early to cook.
[178:19.17]I don't want to go outside.
[178:20.03]It's too early to cook.
[178:21.27]I need to wake up first.
[178:22.21]Alright, we'll go take a shower.
[178:26.11]Sweater and clothes.
[178:27.15]Alright, put on the sweater.
[178:28.86]Put on the clothes.
[178:33.12]I'll run myself a bath.
[178:39.81]The Frania washing machine.
[178:41.25]I spent two days in the queue to get it.
[178:43.07]I'll run myself back.
[178:52.64]Oh.
[179:13.27]Don't wake up and step in the trap!
[179:17.77]Oh, that would have been so horrible.
[179:24.30]That would not even have been my fault.
[179:26.60]And you all know it.
[179:27.20]Alright, let's back to storage.
[179:31.20]And then I'm going for the train.
[179:42.18]Make another bear trap for later.
[179:43.56]Okay... Light armor.
[179:49.08]Let's do it.
[179:52.61]Bingo.
[179:54.71]Batteries.
[179:55.83]Magazines.
[179:57.87]Traps.

[179:59.67]Put the wood away.
[180:00.55]Put the nails away.
[180:01.73]Keep the pills.
[180:03.97]Pills can sit out here.
[180:04.87]That's fine.
[180:05.83]Put the scrap away and put the bullet away as well.
[180:08.57]I got two hunting rifle.
[180:10.52]I'm gonna hold on to it for an emergency scenario.
[180:13.42]I'm ready.
[180:13.90]Let's go.
[180:14.86]I'm out the door.
[180:19.60]Need to go to the train wreck.
[180:30.40]Wood for health.
[180:32.64]That's true.

[181:05.02]Yeah, I might come back out to the hallway strat.
[181:11.48]Alright, can I eat?
[181:15.42]Can I just bear wood?
[181:20.35]I can.
[181:20.65]Alright, I was going to bring five.
[181:22.59]Alright, that's fine.
[181:23.37]Cool.
[181:25.73]And we're out.
[181:32.36]Bear ass.
[181:38.58]Over here, let's check it out.
[181:48.38]If we come across any other bullshit, I have an upgraded axe.
[181:54.23]The thing is meaty.
[181:57.59]I can swing it a bunch of times, don't have to worry about it breaking.
[182:01.78]We're at the hunter's house.
[182:03.26]We've already went in here.
[182:09.30]I'm going to take some pills.
[182:12.24]Because I want to be able to run for a little while.
[182:17.86]Straight over here.
[182:19.56]Location found.
[182:20.44]Question mark.
[182:28.35]Is that a camp?
[182:29.13]I don't understand.
[182:35.23]Why is this a question mark?
[182:51.21]But to be fair, it's the same color as the ground.
[182:56.87]It's easy to miss, because look at all these rocks.
[182:59.73]It's the same thing, but they're not rocks.
[183:02.79]They're whatever.
[183:03.64]You get it.
[183:05.54]I'm not the only one.
[183:09.88]Where's the train?
[183:10.52]Okay.
[183:23.95]What's up?
[183:26.76]What's up?
[183:55.57]Give me those shrooms.
[184:01.98]Got it.
[184:02.78]OK, train.
[184:14.08]So what's up with the train?
[184:36.63]Alright.
[184:42.43]Just checking the perimeter.
[184:44.26]There is something.
[184:45.60]Hold on.
[184:52.82]Get all the stuff.
[185:01.07]Okay.
[185:04.19]Cool.
[185:06.18]Got everything.
[185:07.66]Now what the hell is... What do I do with this train?
[185:19.63]Is that right?
[185:21.73]No.
[185:29.50]Can I go in here?
[185:37.44]So why is this such a big point of interest?
[185:39.02]I thought it was like, go, there's a train, there's a train.
[185:54.99]What do I mean, use my mouse?
[186:00.71]What?
[186:11.89]That's a door, but how do I open it?
[186:23.34]That's a door.
[186:28.99]This looks like it.
[186:29.87]This is the door.
[186:32.37]Okay.
[186:35.83]Right, what was the code?
[186:39.84]Note with a code.
[186:41.56]Found some code in the darkened house.
[186:42.66]I don't know what it's for, but I hope it opens that door.
[186:47.92]So what the hell?
[186:51.40]8909.
[187:03.57]What?
[187:03.97]What are you doing here?
[187:12.98]Photo of, okay.
[187:15.41]And alcohol.
[187:19.05]Don't come near me!
[187:20.85]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[187:28.95]The doctor is lying against the train car's wall.
[187:31.21]His face is covered in sweat.
[187:33.28]An intense odor of alcohol hangs in the air.
[187:39.26]Don't come any closer, you rotten dog.
[187:42.23]I will give you the key.
[187:43.67]Can't you understand?
[187:44.43]I saved your life.
[187:46.23]You'd run away in that clearing if it wasn't for me.
[187:49.07]You owe me for fuck's sake.
[187:51.75]The doctor moves closer to the wall, grotesquely kicking his legs against the floor.
[187:56.93]You think I don't know who you are, rat?
[187:59.59]I've managed to get a good look at you.
[188:02.27]Your kind visits us whenever you please.
[188:04.56]You hide behind the trees, you watch us from a distance, and then you disappear.
[188:09.32]You have no idea how it is to live here.
[188:12.06]This place, these woods, everything is fucked up here.
[188:15.06]I won't take it anymore, do you understand?
[188:17.55]I won't bear a look at those deformed, reeking bodies anymore.
[188:21.49]Nor the cries of those wretched villagers.
[188:24.45]First they begged for help, now I need to hide from them?
[188:27.30]I'm just an ordinary doctor.
[188:29.10]How the fuck was I supposed to help them?
[188:33.12]His face goes silent.
[188:34.76]Now hugging the wall of the train car, he looks truly pathetic.
[188:38.32]Can you hear it?
[188:39.82]It's the walls.
[188:41.42]They speak to me.
[188:43.23]My little girl is calling me.
[188:46.33]I know she's waiting for me.
[188:48.11]I must come back to her.
[188:49.35]She's so close.
[188:52.60]I want to go back home.
[188:57.49]Please.
[188:58.87]This key is my only chance.
[189:00.57]Help me escape this place.
[189:01.97]Help me or kill me.
[189:19.90]Show the underground entrance on the map.
[189:30.11]Save him.
[189:30.69]Kill him.
[189:31.51]Don't help him.
[189:32.57]He's a rat.
[189:33.31]Kill him.
[189:34.65]That's the guy from the start of the game.
[189:36.59]This is that bastard.
[189:44.90]Kill him with kindness.
[189:47.52]This is too... This is not a decision I can make.
[189:51.48]Kill him.
[189:53.22]Save him.
[189:56.17]Choose wisely.
[190:21.91]Let's go What are we doing to this guy?
[190:43.70]Pretty unanimous to save him
[190:47.36]Kill then save him.
[190:49.46]Kill him and then be like, alright, I guess I'll let you know where it is.
[190:53.58]Yeah, kill him and then show him on the map where to get out.
[190:56.76]You know, like stick the axe in his chest and then show him the map and go, this is how you get out.
[191:03.93]No!
[191:05.15]And it's his last thing he sees.
[191:06.47]Alright, we're saving him.
[191:11.86]Thanks for voting.
[191:14.70]Show the underground entrance on the map.
[191:16.68]I take out the map and show the doctor the location of the abandoned house with the hidden underground entrance.
[191:21.80]The doctor stares at the map for a long while without lifting his gaze to meet me.
[191:25.43]Thank you.
[191:26.39]He removes his dirty glasses with a trembling hand and freezes.
[191:29.43]I will wait for you there and better take the essential things with you.
[191:35.51]Looks like returning here will be impossible.
[191:41.31]Found the doctor.
[191:52.10]Where are we going?
[191:57.85]Like the village?
[192:19.24]Oh, there, underground entrance.
[192:20.94]Oh, right, that, with the key, and the 21, at the beginning of the game.
[192:26.44]Right, okay.
[192:29.02]How did I get there before?
[192:30.14]So I gotta go all the way back here.
[192:31.30]Oh, that's not, that sucks, okay.
[192:36.00]Well, doctor, I'll see you at the X. It's getting late, so it's time to get the heck out of here.
[192:52.51]It's noon.
[192:53.27]I could go through here.
[192:56.07]I'll go through here and send my stuff here?
[193:03.17]That's an easier place to hold.
[193:04.33]Let me see if I can do that.
[193:10.82]Noon is late for boomers.
[193:16.56]I need to take drugs, like, seriously.
[193:19.24]Give it a rest.
[193:19.92]Come on, man.
[193:20.52]Let's go.
[193:27.20]Can I go down?
[193:27.74]Leave me alone.
[193:40.13]Unnatural wall.
[193:44.38]Burned house.
[194:00.21]Oh, fuck.
[194:16.61]Where is this thing?
[194:22.77]Why does it have to be these giant logs everywhere?
[194:28.61]Down all the way around.
[194:32.07]I walked by it.
[194:33.85]What?
[194:36.61]I know it's right here, but I can't... How do I get around this shit?
[194:43.41]Down here?
[194:43.99]Yeah, alright, there's one spot.
[194:50.80]There's one parking space worth of space for me to go through the unnatural wall.
[195:10.78]The fuck is it?
[195:12.41]I don't like this vision shit.
[195:39.16]A key to the burned house.
[195:41.66]In a Flickr magazine.
[195:43.60]1975.
[195:43.76]I need a key.
[195:44.42]I just got it.
[196:11.04]There's shit over there.
[196:35.97]Okay.
[196:57.50]This didn't do anything!
[196:58.66]Oh, there's no chests here!
[197:04.32]It was a lie!
[197:16.00]I'm just checking around the whole house.
[197:17.43]Relax.
[197:18.13]I'm just checking around the whole house.
[197:19.55]Relax.
[197:20.89]Relax, Jeremy.
[197:22.87]I'm sorry.
[197:23.33]There's nothing in there.
[197:36.75]Don't relax.
[197:38.25]No, I'm just saying that out loud.
[197:43.30]Alright.
[197:54.62]Made it.
[198:00.83]Look at that.
[198:02.93]Shortcut to this old house.
[198:09.29]Alright.
[198:10.99]Dried meadow, here we are.
[198:12.05]Oh, hell yeah.
[198:22.58]I remember this place.
[198:23.48]This is my first house.
[198:26.38]Does my stove still work?
[198:29.71]Oh, you better believe it does.
[198:35.41]Light the oven.
[198:42.52]Ten?
[198:43.14]Essence?
[198:43.64]What is this bullshit?
[198:46.90]Alright.
[198:47.84]We're good.
[198:49.44]Um...
[198:53.03]I have to survive in here.
[199:04.35]Does this place have gas?
[199:17.58]What about he- is that a container?
[199:19.08]Do I have anything for the container?
[199:28.44]Alright, this has got plenty of gas.
[199:32.74]I don't even need to fill it.
[199:35.53]Alright, but I do need to... I do need to fill the thing to make some boards and try to board up a couple of windows here.
[199:41.53]I have to lick her.
[199:42.11]Are you guys cheating?
[199:47.28]Wait, is everybody cheating right now?
[199:49.36]Why do I know that?
[199:50.34]Should I know that?
[199:50.94]Or are you just cheating?
[200:02.68]It was under the thing.
[200:06.62]This is cheating.
[200:14.55]She has just cheated.
[200:16.41]Exploding barrels?
[200:25.10]This is- I'm- this is cheating.
[200:27.78]I have an exploding barrel.
[200:29.42]Alright, wait a minute.
[200:32.39]We saw that code already.
[200:34.91]Alright, I believe you.
[200:37.97]Believe you this once.
[200:58.55]Exploding barrel!
[201:02.62]Okay.
[201:03.44]I'm gonna have to check that.
[201:04.20]I'm gonna have to set that up tonight.
[201:08.32]That's cool.
[201:11.32]Alright.
[201:12.02]Let's store some of this shit.
[201:14.92]I need to keep the wood out.
[201:17.26]I still have plenty of... Put the fabric away.
[201:19.68]Keep the... Let's do a bear trap.
[201:25.99]And then single shot pistol.
[201:27.65]Who cares?
[201:28.93]Fire it once and just throw it away.
[201:31.21]Knife is going to be for an emergency scenario.
[201:34.39]Or actually, I don't need the... Yeah, that's okay.
[201:37.17]I have heal.
[201:37.85]Exploding barrel.
[201:39.83]Let's put the exploding barrel up.
[201:41.74]Nails.
[201:42.08]I need that to board up some stuff.
[201:43.20]Let's do that right now.
[201:45.12]This is boarded.
[201:46.50]This is boarded.
[201:48.72]This is going to be boarded as well.
[201:50.84]This is a great place to do this.
[201:57.52]I need... I need that light.
[202:02.14]Turn the generator on.
[202:14.78]Let him guess!
[202:16.40]Yeah.
[202:23.38]So that will come in handy here.
[202:24.98]There's only one.
[202:31.47]Alright.
[202:32.17]What the fuck did I say?
[202:34.17]I smashed my face against the door.
[202:40.62]There's only one lamp in here.
[202:41.82]Alright, this is not gonna happen.
[202:46.98]Like, why can I not have a level up scenario where... We're staying here.
[203:13.32]This is perfect.
[203:14.50]This is amazing.
[203:23.37]Holy shit.
[203:23.93]This is the best room in the whole game.
[203:25.17]Oh, barrel.
[203:29.61]Let's put the exploding barrel over here.
[203:34.86]No, not yet.
[203:35.54]This is a cool item.
[203:36.24]I'm going to save it.
[203:38.44]Let's go.
[203:51.64]Don't let that light leak out.
[203:53.85]It's, uh, I know, you're right.
[203:55.47]It's, like, too late to move this shit.
[203:59.57]I wish I could, like, activate a thing that made it so I could move stuff.
[204:03.74]Not like a toddler.
[204:06.56]You put me on the back of this thing to move it, and if I need to move it in a... If you know, I don't care about scratching the floor.
[204:12.65]I'm going to sprint and fucking be able to move this thing 100 miles per hour.
[204:25.32]The only reason why people move furniture like that is because they're concerned about scratching their floors.
[204:28.79]Alright.
[204:37.47]Just hang on.
[205:10.49]Here we go.
[205:12.93]This is where we lose.
[205:15.47]Is he gonna cry?
[205:16.23]No.
[205:25.43]You drinking lemon juice is my secret slime.
[205:32.41]Don't forget your rifle at the other base.
[205:34.09]Oh, I won't.
[205:35.39]I plan on actually going back up there.
[205:46.21]In fact, no.
[205:47.39]Just use the axe.
[205:52.30]Take the bell.
[205:52.88]Oh yeah, there's a bunch of stuff.
[205:54.42]I need to... There's a bunch of shit up there.
[205:58.14]I don't have the bell down here.
[206:00.94]I can't ring it.
[206:07.36]Can we just light a flare?
[206:08.37]Okay.
[206:14.19]Okay.
[206:28.21]I mean, it's just sitting there.
[206:32.05]Best emote coming through.
[206:33.94]Vroom.
[206:40.64]I've done a pretty good job just sitting still.
[206:52.07]And... I'm going to scrap all these traps.
[207:07.94]Somebody running around outside over here?
[207:13.86]Can you hear it?
[207:15.28]It's... Wait, this is the part.
[207:25.37]Doesn't one of these like spawn something?
[207:34.91]I got plenty of room to move around here though, so I should be fine.
[207:45.97]Yeah, I got the axe.
[207:48.39]Best melee weapon in the game, so don't worry, I'll be good.
[207:52.20]The bell's not gonna work in Chapter 2.
[207:53.74]Oh.
[207:55.46]Well, whatever.
[208:35.99]God, this is so much better than the other place.
[208:41.61]Angel.
[208:42.19]Angel Thumb.
[208:42.73]Not yet.
[208:44.09]Not yet.
[208:45.68]Two more hours.
[208:46.42]This shit can go horribly wrong at 7.30.
[209:33.61]There you are.
[209:35.51]There you are.
[209:36.83]Alright, let's break him down.
[209:49.50]Alright, move!
[210:03.26]Dismantle.
[210:06.16]Hi.
[210:12.82]The man grabs my arm and pulls me closer.
[210:14.60]A strong smell of mushrooms assails my nostrils.
[210:18.32]The old sack covering his body slides down, revealing his chest, covered in horrid growths.
[210:24.37]It is fused with a porous helmet, pulsating to the rhythm of his breath.
[210:29.59]I'm starting to feel dizzy.
[210:31.49]Although loosening his grip, the man raises his left arm, bringing his forearm to my face, and forces a dab out of me.
[210:41.32]It's pale as paper in reeds.
[210:43.10]Okay.
[210:45.64]Do not open the door.
[210:46.56]Let's stick together.
[210:56.49]Do not open the door.
[210:59.75]Hold it.
[211:07.87]Medium caliber.
[211:13.29]I don't have any junk for you.
[211:14.27]I don't need more room.
[211:17.85]Um... What do I have here that I don't care about?
[211:29.87]I eat this wood, though.
[211:32.76]Uh, just hold on.
[211:33.48]I'll still... I'll store some of this stuff.
[211:36.84]Don't leave the trader!
[211:39.38]Well, eventually I have to.
[211:40.74]Can't just...
[211:46.54]I'm going to save the scrap.
[211:50.68]I might need it eventually.
[211:52.06]I'll sell the fabric.
[212:03.78]Hmm.
[212:04.44]I don't know.
[212:07.24]Single shot pistol.
[212:08.64]I don't need.
[212:09.24]What the hell am I going to do with that right now?
[212:11.76]Nails.
[212:12.44]Boards.
[212:13.25]Just give me a second.
[212:22.07]Mushroom, scrap, magazine, medium caliber bullet.
[212:27.43]Okay, that's what I want.
[212:28.67]And then you can take... Just take this meat.
[212:31.71]I'm not going to use it.
[212:32.59]Yes, I will.
[212:45.69]Can I upgrade my hotbar again?
[212:46.94]Or is it over?
[212:52.64]I can't craft any more.
[212:53.72]I can't craft any more of this.
[212:56.60]So it's going into the trash.
[212:58.62]I'm just gonna sell it.
[213:10.89]Weird Jupiter.
[213:16.11]Alright.
[213:19.82]I have to...
[213:22.36]Go back to the other... hideout.
[213:28.42]And get myself ready for the final boss.
[213:38.22]Cook this.
[213:39.90]Keep the scrap.
[213:41.40]Take the rags too.
[213:43.02]And the nails.
[213:44.66]Yeah, and the gas.
[213:46.68]Replace the gas with just 3 wood, who gives a shit.
[213:50.98]Alright.
[213:52.80]Here we go.
[213:56.98]Cook that thing.
[213:59.10]20 Essence?
[213:59.86]What a waste of money!
[214:00.58]Alright, this is the part I'm gonna go back up to the old spot.
[214:08.16]Which is here.
[214:10.16]Get everything I want, meet the guy down here.
[214:15.26]Sounds like a plan.
[214:17.61]And I'm probably going to have to last one more night in the... I'm going to try to... No.
[214:20.98]I'm going to try to go up, get everything I want, come down, last a night, go over here.
[214:28.27]That's the plan.
[214:28.95]I'm out.
[214:29.39]Let's go.
[214:30.55]Make it quick.
[214:36.56]Straight up.
[215:16.50]I'm coming back down here.
[215:19.24]So I want this to be full of gas.
[215:20.66]Let's go.
[215:33.40]At least one more knight over there.
[215:43.82]You have any drugs?
[215:46.08]If I have them, take them.
[215:47.94]Food?
[215:48.46]Drugs?
[215:49.76]No.
[215:50.18]Let's go.
[215:50.74]Hurry up.
[215:57.61]Food and drugs.
[215:59.29]That's all you need.
[216:02.17]In this game.
[216:05.78]Not actually.
[216:14.99]I need to go up through this little, this little hut, right?
[216:18.41]Is it over here?
[216:20.45]There.
[216:21.05]Where the car is.
[216:21.99]Alright, making good time.
[216:28.52]Through the house.
[216:32.34]And then it's just up and to the left.
[216:37.70]Oh my god, Jeremy!
[216:39.81]Jeremy!
[216:58.56]Oh, woods.
[217:08.15]Okay, almost there.

[228:34.86]I'm gonna just attack it.
[228:36.60]It's going to be killed.
[228:39.45]There's enough gas to last one more night.
[228:43.15]Anybody that comes in here is going to be killed.
[228:53.13]And this is right there.
[228:54.03]But it's nighttime.
[228:59.28]I could just go right here and meet the doctor.
[229:04.16]But it's 17 o'clock.
[229:08.77]Should I just do this?
[229:09.69]Do I have time to get over there?
[229:10.55]I need to repair my shit.
[229:12.73]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[229:13.61]No, do I?
[229:14.69]No, let's go.
[229:15.23]Hold on, let me repair my shit.
[229:25.81]Okay, I'm going.
[229:28.81]Alright, doctor.
[229:29.79]The doctor's going to explode.
[229:30.89]He's going to turn into a giant monster.
[229:32.13]Do I have time?
[229:34.21]Let's go.
[229:35.01]I better find it.
[229:39.26]I already- Did I use the runner already?
[229:40.76]I did.
[229:40.98]I don't have any drugs.
[229:53.09]Oh, I hope I- Yeah, here it is.
[229:57.07]Made it.
[229:57.29]Alright, where's the doctor?
[230:07.17]I should take everything I need with me coming back my proven possible.
[230:11.03]Way ahead of you.
[230:14.37]Way ahead of you.
[230:19.93]Do I have everything I need?
[230:20.83]Yes.
[230:21.87]Do I?
[230:28.72]Oh shit, I have to do this.
[230:34.88]Backpack.
[230:47.74]How would the doctor do this by himself?
[230:49.24]There's no way he would.
[231:03.29]What's up?
[231:12.28]Are we going?
[231:21.66]Locked.
[231:22.00]It's my only way out.
[231:23.00]I won't be able to open it without my key.
[231:24.72]Ask the doctor to use the key.
[231:26.16]Look at the handle.
[231:28.10]Hey, you open this in case something's back here that's bad.
[231:31.40]That's funny.
[231:35.51]Yeah, you do it.
[231:37.83]Look through the keyhole.
[231:38.73]Somebody's standing there.
[231:45.37]Alright, doctor.
[231:48.12]Go for it.
[231:52.58]You go first.
[232:25.24]I think someone's still moving there under the rubble.
[232:37.34]Man.
[232:41.23]I stumbled upon something amongst the rubble.
[232:44.77]Strange soft item.
[232:48.99]Who goes there?
[232:49.35]Are you one of them?
[233:12.42]In many attempts to get up, but fails.
[233:14.16]I can see him desperately flailing his limbs around.
[233:16.18]It's as if his back has been glued to the ground.
[233:20.38]No, please!
[233:21.96]As I approach him, he shuffles his legs nervously, as if trying to retreat into the collapsed tunnel.
[233:27.27]I didn't do anything, I beg you.
[233:28.63]I just wanted to pass.
[233:30.67]To get back to my family.
[233:33.13]The tree is blocked.
[233:33.85]The only way out, the only path home, a huge talking tree!
[233:37.77]I begged it to let me pass, but it wouldn't listen.
[233:40.65]I could not understand what it was saying to me.
[233:43.49]So it came here.
[233:44.27]The man props himself up on his elbows with a huge effort.
[233:48.19]He tries to straighten his body, but something is firmly holding him by the back and the neck.
[233:53.90]I can't, I can't do it.
[233:54.92]I can't get up.
[233:57.76]The man drops into the rubble and goes silent.
[233:59.94]He clenches his fist.
[234:01.62]My head hurts.
[234:03.63]The man places his hand on his forehead and feels a strange dent above his left brow.
[234:08.09]He freezes.
[234:10.23]What?
[234:11.17]What is this?
[234:13.37]He carefully inserts his index finger into the hole.
[234:16.09]His eyelid twitches.
[234:18.69]My stone!
[234:21.59]I hear a sound as if an eggshell cracking.
[234:23.63]The forehead bends under his hand.
[234:26.81]stranger pushes another finger into the hole a thick goose pews from the wound I can hear his skull cracking my little stone the man slowly removes his fingers from the hole in his head a colorless ooze dripping from them he's holding something a round object that's why
[234:49.90]He swings his left hand and throws the object at me.
[234:52.60]A small irregular ball bounces off my arm and lands at my feet.
[234:58.66]Looks like a bullet, but it's soft.
[235:00.64]Okay.
[235:09.24]This is what put me to sleep.
[235:12.44]His head lifelessly drops to the concrete floor of the destroyed tunnel and goes still.
[235:22.70]Suddenly, I can hear the bang of the metal door followed by the sound of fading footsteps.
[235:26.30]It's the doctor.
[235:27.16]What do you mean, it's the doctor?
[235:31.86]The big sign on the door reads, closed ahead.
[235:49.35]Where's the doctor?
[235:50.15]Where'd he go?
[235:57.10]Oh, yuck.
[236:05.77]I just wanted to pass.
[236:09.78]Return to my family.
[236:27.67]Good thing I got this military flashlight.
[236:35.06]Oh shit, that's a lizard.
[236:42.91]Where is it?
[236:44.07]Where is it?
[236:44.63]Where is it?
[237:01.82]growths?
[237:03.46]Some strange organic growths.
[237:08.48]What the hell are you?
[237:14.27]Eyes?
[237:18.61]Soft organism growing out of the ground.
[237:28.16]Ooh, shiny.
[237:30.02]A shiny stone tied to a wooden cross.
[237:53.04]You're playing a challenging and unforgiving game.
[237:54.70]You will not be led by the hand.
[237:55.68]Respect the woods.
[237:56.30]Be patient and focus.
[238:06.77]Still on first island.
[238:10.67]Tutorial complete.
[238:24.00]Where'd the doctor go?
[238:25.70]Chapter two.
[238:29.24]How long is chapter two?
[238:35.42]The swamp.
[238:40.84]It's twice as long.
[238:46.42]It's ten hours?
[238:52.11]Oh, shit.
[238:54.49]Broken compressor.
[238:55.67]A damaged compressor used to refill oxygen tanks.
[238:57.71]I should be able to fix it.
[239:00.58]I don't have that thing.
[239:03.26]Oh, fuck.
[239:03.72]There's like a whole area.
[239:04.84]Alright.
[239:05.32]Let's go.
[239:05.80]Is there only two?
[239:08.10]Is there more?
[239:08.52]There's only two chapters, right?
[239:16.71]Rusty oxygen tanks.
[239:18.21]They're useless.
[239:20.64]Generator.
[239:21.28]Well, here's the house.
[239:23.38]Good thing I brought the gas.
[239:46.62]Dump the whole thing.
[239:47.66]That's why I brought it.
[239:50.22]Alright.
[239:52.56]Is there a stove in here?
[239:55.04]Gas tank.
[239:56.76]Hitting the tank will release the gas under high pressure.
[239:59.58]Note.
[240:05.51]Day one.
[240:06.51]The compressor is broken.
[240:07.87]So is the lock on the trapdoor leading to the underground.
[240:12.57]Had to use a blowtorch.
[240:14.67]Fucking moisture.
[240:16.75]We took photos of the tree from observation point in the vicinity of 3C.
[240:21.87]It grew twice its size in a month.
[240:24.22]Really quick, even for a local standard.
[240:30.80]Okay.
[240:31.42]1520 hours.
[240:31.72]I'm slowly running out of oxygen.
[240:33.18]I've sent two men to search for nearby junkyard.
[240:35.64]Maybe we won't have to go back for spare parts for the compressor.
[240:39.98]Watch out for the cottage near the junkyard marked building on the map.
[240:44.09]Someone could be living there.
[240:48.54]At least 10 locals lurking between the trees.
[240:51.73]How do they know about us?
[240:52.87]We won't be able to gather our equipment in time.
[240:55.21]The risk of getting detected is too high.
[240:57.41]Need to evac.
[241:02.07]What the hell?
[241:09.55]There's a stove.
[241:19.43]Radio?
[241:20.13]It's covered in a thick layer of dust.
[241:21.37]Looks like no one's used it for a long time, but it still smells of warm plastic and burnt wires.
[241:27.98]Okay, I gotta get this place ready.
[241:30.26]Where's the workbench?
[241:33.86]New house.
[241:37.12]Stop doing that!
[241:49.76]Can I throw like a grenade down here?
[241:51.12]Alright, this is a bigger house.
[241:58.30]What's up here?
[241:58.80]Hey, what's that?
[242:02.32]A crate covered in a strange organic black shell.
[242:04.70]I won't be able to open it until I get rid of the substance.
[242:09.24]I can only decipher individual words.
[242:10.93]Shell, thick glue, light.
[242:39.18]Fuck outta here.
[242:39.86]Where's the workbench?
[242:49.28]This place is enormous.
[242:52.57]This looks like a good spot to hide.
[242:57.17]Yeah, this is definitely the spot.
[242:59.63]Here it is.
[243:02.92]I need a key.
[243:05.06]No, what?
[243:09.31]Where's the workbench?
[243:11.83]Is there no workbench?
[243:13.25]It's right there.
[243:17.24]Alright.
[243:18.38]Hold on.
[243:20.66]This is where I need to store some shit.
[243:26.70]Uh, battery.
[243:27.28]Put the shovel away.
[243:28.16]Actually, I'm gonna need all this because I'm gonna board up the doors and everything.
[243:33.22]Alright, scrap can go in here.
[243:35.38]Nails can go in here.
[243:36.34]This drug can go in here.
[243:39.63]Alright, I'm gonna actually keep the nails because I'm gonna have to start boarding stuff up and figure out what I want to do.
[243:43.68]Wardrobe.
[243:44.16]Okay, so we've got light.
[243:50.34]Door, window.
[243:52.44]Window.
[243:54.46]Window.
[243:57.24]Opening.
[243:58.20]Opening.
[243:59.78]I think it's potentially here in the workroom.
[244:06.55]Window, window.
[244:07.43]Open the gook.
[244:09.41]Hold on.
[244:16.28]This might be not a bad place to do it either.
[244:20.00]Like through here.
[244:20.69]Alright, let me go to that crate.
[244:36.79]Nothing even in here.
[244:37.45]Alright.
[244:42.15]I need to repair the compressor.
[244:44.97]I have cottage near the junkyard.
[244:47.53]Village.
[244:47.95]These are marked on the map now.
[244:51.31]Alright.
[244:54.83]Where do I want to go?
[244:55.77]Maybe here.
[244:56.47]This is not terrible.
[245:00.83]There's a door.
[245:01.39]There's already a barricaded window.
[245:05.45]People can get through this though, I think.
[245:13.14]I don't know.
[245:14.46]Or in here.
[245:15.04]I would say down there is probably the safest.
[245:21.55]Let's go ahead and start that process.
[245:24.15]This is not bad either.
[245:28.78]It's in here.
[245:30.16]This is the one.
[245:36.47]this is the one okay so looks like the only real reason to come through here I'm gonna board this up this can be there that's fine let me just take a look outside exploding barrel oh my god I have a bunch of these oh I feel like this is gonna get hard or something this is where it gets hard right this is where this is where it gets very hard
[246:14.02]Alright.
[246:16.72]So, let me check down here.
[246:18.02]Let me make sure it doubles.
[246:19.66]I hate when that fucking thing does that.
[246:24.01]This is not ideal.
[246:25.05]Actually, it's not that bad, though.
[246:26.53]I have to just pick one.
[246:27.49]I have to pick one.
[246:28.91]The workbench room is good, but it's too small.
[246:33.39]This is too small.
[246:37.65]Too small.
[246:38.45]I don't like it.
[246:38.95]Too small.
[246:40.49]We're going up here.
[246:41.79]This is the one.
[246:46.14]This one's a little bit bigger.
[246:52.26]This one's already barricaded.
[246:53.18]Let's do this one.
[246:56.62]And there's already a lamp in here too.
[247:01.54]We can board this, but not yet.
[247:05.64]I can even board this.
[247:06.40]They can only come in from one way.
[247:07.38]Let's bring this up here.
[247:20.89]I went to the store and came back.
[247:22.31]Is he still... Is he still dying to bear?
[247:25.76]Is it time to save bear traps?
[247:31.42]And... Exploding barrel.
[247:34.20]Right here.
[247:36.48]Let's do it.
[247:36.95]Exploding barrel right here.
[247:40.85]I'm gonna wait for someone to come in.
[247:42.77]Boom.
[247:43.99]Good night.
[247:56.64]Okay.
[247:59.02]What's going on?
[248:00.08]It's raining.
[248:01.48]Alright.
[248:02.02]Wardrobe.
[248:02.62]We got matches.
[248:03.54]Rag.
[248:05.20]Where's the generator?
[248:06.60]I gotta burn that into my mind.
[248:08.32]Up.
[248:08.80]Right.
[248:10.24]Down.
[248:13.34]We got gas.
[248:17.60]We can come through here though.
[248:20.56]Pick up the gas tank.
[248:21.84]No.
[248:22.94]Make some traps?
[248:23.97]Let's make a few traps.
[248:30.77]Yeah, I wouldn't like being in here.
[248:36.61]So that's how you get the generator on.
[248:37.89]This is a long way to go, except for right there.
[248:42.65]But it's alright, I'll explode these motherfuckers when they come in the door.
[248:46.67]Or, like, you know, that's a... Yep, that's a... No, it's not.
[248:49.96]That's a dead end.
[248:50.60]That's a bad strategy.
[249:03.25]Alright, bear traps.
[249:03.87]Let's go.
[249:04.83]I gotta... I keep getting new places.
[249:23.33]Bear traps.
[249:25.21]Make two or three of them.
[249:31.35]Looking good.
[249:37.19]Pull them out.
[249:41.12]Let's go.
[249:42.30]This is the final new place that's true.
[249:44.54]Let's get plenty of gas.
[249:57.94]Stop with that!
[250:00.73]Board it up, board it up.
[250:02.79]Bear trap here.
[250:04.99]This is a good place for it to be.
[250:06.15]I could not ask for a better place to have it.
[250:09.91]Because then I really only have to worry about this side over here.
[250:13.48]And some random psycho that just, like, comes in the room.
[250:30.54]That's secure.
[250:31.14]That's secure.
[250:32.98]This is not secure.
[250:34.24]But it's about to be.
[250:36.42]Because I want to show you how I do it.
[250:58.55]Check this out.
[251:02.15]I'm gonna put a bear trap here, and if I hear that get activated... Oh, I open the door.
[251:08.72]And blast.
[251:29.74]Although I can't leave if I do this.
[251:31.44]So that's the plan.
[251:32.00]No, that's the plan.
[251:40.48]Put the gun back here.
[251:43.10]Flashlight back here.
[251:46.81]I'm going to keep that in my inventory.
[251:48.73]Heals can stay.
[251:49.59]Now I'm going to go store this stuff.
[251:51.21]Because everything's been boarded.
[251:52.23]I just need... How many do you need to board?
[251:54.25]What is it?
[251:54.61]It's... Three and seven.
[251:57.81]So I need...
[251:59.69]3, 6, 9.
[252:01.19]Wood.
[252:02.53]And then 21.
[252:04.81]9 and 21.
[252:05.27]Because in case these break.
[252:22.70]So.
[252:24.86]Stick that.
[252:25.70]I need 9 of these.
[252:34.31]That was a really stupid way to do that, but whatever.
[252:36.59]Alright, nine of these.
[252:37.31]Put the barrels back.
[252:39.81]Eclipse can stay, and I need 21 of these.
[252:45.76]Okay.
[252:46.98]Don't need matches.
[252:48.52]I might hold on to one of these just to do it.
[252:50.72]Here's the heal.
[252:51.40]And I also have bandages.
[252:54.32]I'm going to store these.
[252:59.70]Store the flare.
[253:01.54]Battery's fine. 921.
[253:06.62]A panic scenario might be alright.
[253:08.43]Alright, we're good.
[253:09.23]We're good.
[253:10.97]Okay.
[253:12.31]I have a plan.
[253:14.21]I have a plan.
[253:22.65]There's one of these down here, too.
[253:23.93]Actually, I'm gonna keep that down.
[253:26.65]This is bait.
[253:27.71]Because when this turns on, it's gonna be flashing through the window.
[253:31.53]This is gonna attract so many people into this room.
[253:39.47]I think that's not a bad call.
[253:40.48]I don't want it.
[253:48.18]Alright.
[253:48.58]It's almost time.
[253:58.75]Thank you for coming through this door.
[254:03.99]Because... Um...
[254:12.61]I wouldn't have known it existed.
[254:13.77]Here we go.
[254:20.87]I'm going to turn on the generator.
[254:23.29]Just wait.
[254:25.89]I don't want to waste that much gas.
[254:30.29]Surround yourself with explosive barrels and traps and just let the monsters come at you.
[254:33.62]Go out in a blaze of glory.
[254:38.14]You don't get jebaited here.
[254:39.88]I won't.
[254:42.35]But what's gonna happen is... I'm gonna keep this door open.
[254:46.15]When I hear the first, like... I'm gonna just open the door.
[254:52.03]Make sure I ca- How big of an explosion radius is this?
[254:58.12]Can somebody help me out here?
[255:05.12]Is it huge?
[255:08.60]I'm gonna get this in the corner.
[255:15.55]So if I have this here, I want to make sure I can open the door.
[255:18.75]Alright, so let's do a little rehearsal here.
[255:22.89]What's that?
[255:24.27]Somebody right there.
[255:26.03]Boom.
[255:32.33]Because the traps are going to be right here.

[255:53.35]I got time.
[255:53.95]I got time to do it.
[255:54.71]I got time to do it.
[255:55.75]Oh, they already blocked the light.
[255:59.85]Fuck you, I almost... I found new signs.
[256:07.24]17 kilometers west of the hideout.
[256:10.90]33 points, 12 circles.
[256:12.52]Cataloged pattern.
[256:13.44]5 simple scribblings.
[256:15.72]And a madman.
[256:19.06]3 shotgun shells.
[256:19.70]Okay.
[256:24.15]Why is this chair here?
[256:27.29]Get out of the way.
[257:02.22]Got it.
[257:02.76]Good.
[257:03.20]Okay.
[257:03.75]Pull this back here.
[257:06.93]So it can still open.
[257:08.03]Trap.
[257:09.69]Put it down.
[257:13.89]Let's go!
[257:14.29]This has got to move in the corner.

[258:09.93]I can't, I can't move anything, guys.
[258:14.08]Oh.
[258:16.08]Christ.
[258:17.32]Is it the radio?
[258:21.44]E-F.

[258:31.83]F-W-R-A.
[258:48.60]comb us come back to us come back to us come back to us I'm close
[259:19.30]Okay, just chill.
[259:36.00]The reason why I don't wanna move the chair is because it's gonna make noise.
[259:52.84]Alright, hold on.
[259:54.99]I can still see out of my... What are you doing?
[259:59.89]Why is this stuff moving?
[260:01.77]Why is this stuff moving?
[260:13.40]What the fuck?
[260:15.86]No, my trap!
[260:17.94]My plan!
[260:19.02]You've ruined my plan!
[260:24.45]Don't move.
[260:32.39]It's bait.
[260:33.25]To get you to scream.
[260:35.41]So they can know where you are.
[260:45.26]It's just a dog.
[260:46.68]You're not gonna get in.
[260:55.09]No, you won't get in.
[260:56.69]You got that and you have the door to do as well.
[260:59.41]By the way, if you do get in... I'll get you.
[261:06.07]Cassie, thanks for the five community subs, Cassie.
[261:13.19]Five dropped there.
[261:14.29]Alright, I gotta be ready.
[261:18.06]This dog is not going to go into the trap.
[261:22.36]It will if I go like this though.
[261:26.91]Oh, shit.
[261:32.25]Oh, what the fuck!
[261:32.99]There's an alien in the room!
[261:37.53]The dog didn't even hit the trap!
[262:13.20]Does the eye see me?
[262:18.97]Don't get comfortable yet.
[262:20.59]That was horrible.
[263:15.19]Here's how that happened.
[263:16.93]Well, first of all, it shouldn't happen, but the reason is because you can see this object, that's movable, this object, all the objects in the room.
[263:26.94]That one's not here, but the other ones are.
[263:28.99]And it's the only thing that doesn't show up.
[263:32.25]And I just...
[263:39.76]Whatever.
[263:41.17]That's still a good strategy, and I'm gonna do it again.
[263:42.93]Well, maybe it's not.
[263:46.73]I'm just gonna keep, you know, you know, fuck that.
[263:50.55]I'm gonna keep this door open.
[263:54.70]Because when an alien like that comes in the room, I need a way to... Okay, I'm gonna put a trap, like, here.
[264:01.58]And, like, run through this door and, like, bait him into the trap.
[264:04.83]I'm not just gonna stand in a cube.
[264:12.83]This is the thing that needs to be boarded.
[264:14.43]This is the thing that needs to be protected.
[264:15.83]And if somebody comes in, you bait them around the trap.
[264:22.34]Anyways.
[264:27.84]I... Where's the traitor?
[264:33.05]Usually they're right here.
[264:44.66]No traitor.
[264:47.80]Didn't it just say I had a reputation as a traitor?
[265:06.27]The three.
[265:06.95]It's fucking Pinwheel.
[265:12.51]Three visitors stare at me in silence as if waiting for my move.
[265:15.49]I can only hear the heavy breathing of the tallest figure holding a giant bag.
[265:21.30]As he opens the bag, the room is filled with an intense smell of mushrooms.
[265:25.72]Apparently they wish to give me something.
[265:30.71]Well, you're very loud.
[265:35.61]Whatever you are.
[265:43.34]Let's go with, um... How many nails do I have?
[265:46.78]Let's get some more nails.
[265:49.92]Get some drugs.
[265:50.88]Get some more... No, no.
[265:52.67]Get these drugs.
[265:56.37]Medium bullet.
[265:57.81]Medium bullet.
[265:58.33]I want the medium bullet.
[265:59.53]Okay.
[266:05.68]Alright, now I'm getting out of here.
[266:11.37]Show item.
[266:12.41]I have nothing to show.
[266:24.98]Okay.
[266:29.44]So I now have four bullets for this rifle.
[266:33.26]Or five, technically, right?
[266:34.30]Because I can shoot it once.
[266:39.42]Let's put...
[266:43.27]Put this stuff away until I come back.
[266:46.07]Not sure exactly what I'm going to be looking for, but I know I will be looking for something.
[266:51.14]Food.
[266:51.84]Shotgun shell.
[266:52.60]I don't have any shotguns.
[266:55.66]Keep those.
[266:57.30]Alright, I'm going to go explore.
[266:58.28]I just got to cook this stuff.
[267:08.71]I almost just jumped.
[267:11.97]I almost just jumped through this window.
[267:16.89]And landed on this.
[267:19.41]I'm gonna do the well.
[267:20.39]Maybe.
[267:20.67]No.
[267:20.79]Broke the computer.
[267:33.87]Where's the, um... Where's the ovens down here?
[267:43.43]Holy shit, that was a lot.
[267:44.33]9,000 each.
[267:47.05]Damn.
[267:49.59]Alright, so I got this village.
[267:50.73]I have this cottage.
[267:53.93]The village was a point of interest.
[268:05.25]Found an abandoned journal in this swamp hideout.
[268:07.39]I managed to mark the village with a tree on my map thanks to it.
[268:10.09]Okay.
[268:15.00]Let's go to the village.
[268:18.80]Let's go for it.
[268:23.56]I have healing.
[268:24.32]I've got everything upgraded.
[268:25.37]It's right here.
[268:29.89]Body of a man wearing a helmet.
[268:31.05]His head has been severed off.
[268:34.67]Severed... What?
[268:36.69]Weird book.
[268:41.60]And key to tunnel 21.
[268:48.18]and a severed head.
[268:50.06]Someone scratched out the word liar on the helmet's Viewfinder.
[269:16.59]Let's go So we're just going this way I already hear a dog What happened to the dog?
[269:31.65]That was strange
[269:44.86]Oh, it's right here.
[270:02.73]Oh.
[270:03.41]Hello.
[270:04.91]Hello.
[270:07.37]Hello.
[270:11.38]What does he do?
[270:16.86]He does like a swing, swing.
[270:17.92]He throws shit.
[270:20.08]Holy fuck dude, are you kidding me?
[270:33.61]You gotta shoot him in the eye.
[270:43.28]It's not enough to heal.
[270:51.28]Listen, there's another one.
[270:54.33]What?
[270:54.91]I wish it would stop raining so I could hear anything.
[270:59.37]I wish I could hear even any... I can't even hear the sound of my own fucking voice.
[271:03.77]Oh, it's the doctor!
[271:16.14]you again what do you want from me want to put me in front of a firing squad for desertion the doctor snorts ironically hiding his irritation I'm not going anywhere with you I'm too close I can hear her just as if she was standing beside me my little we're shaking hands he re he reaches for the cigarette butt between his yellow teeth I'm sure someone's waiting for you too he spits out the rest of the tobacco
[271:47.23]How do I get to the road?
[271:48.05]Why are you showing this to me?
[271:48.99]You better tell me how to get there.
[271:50.15]I don't know how to get... I thought you might know.
[271:53.35]The peasants broke through the wall of trees.
[271:57.81]I could not believe my eyes.
[272:00.24]I tried to do it many times.
[272:01.32]I couldn't manage to cut the trees fast enough.
[272:04.12]It was as if the woods were healing the scars.
[272:07.64]The motherfuckers were growing back right in front of my eyes.
[272:11.02]I was afraid I would get stuck between trunks.
[272:14.43]Losing that sow made their blood run cold.
[272:16.72]They escaped fearing starvation.
[272:19.96]Puffs the cigarette.
[272:21.08]Out of the frying pan and into the fire.
[272:25.04]They have a camp in the old quarry in the southeastern edge of the swamp.
[272:30.83]Thanks.
[272:32.81]I used to come here to treat people.
[272:33.99]I pulled out kids' milk teeth, delivered babies, and then came the diseases I've never even heard of.
[272:41.37]I was the only doctor in the area.
[272:43.91]You cut us off from the outside world.
[272:47.99]First you, then the woods.
[272:49.13]No help from anyone.
[272:50.07]Last time I came here was three or four years ago.
[272:53.29]Then the trees blocked the path.
[272:57.08]I'm going to kill him.
[272:58.50]Just in case anyone is curious.
[273:00.50]The doctor looks around.
[273:01.28]It's different now.
[273:02.00]The fields are flooded.
[273:03.56]Everyone in the village is dead.
[273:04.62]So much work for nothing.
[273:17.62]Embryo, weapon cart, and tape.
[273:23.36]Hmm.
[273:24.98]How much does this give me?
[273:32.49]Should I take the embryo?
[273:38.07]It's $100 for the tape.
[273:45.28]First you were a dog killer, now a doctor killer.
[273:47.48]When will your reign of terror end?
[273:55.75]Alright.
[273:58.02]Some of the flooded areas hide underwater passages.
[274:01.52]Recently, I fell into this underwater den in the western edge of the swamp.
[274:05.64]Okay.
[274:05.84]I have no idea where it leads.
[274:07.48]I'm a shitty diver.
[274:08.39]I've seen similar one in the northeastern edge of the swamp, too.
[274:11.85]You just got all kinds of information to give me.
[274:13.59]There's an info dump on me.
[274:15.29]I've realized something.
[274:16.09]It came to me when we were walking through the tunnels.
[274:18.79]Oh, you mean when you were running from me from the tunnels.
[274:20.79]And two heads are better than one.
[274:22.79]I could have handed you, like, a rifle.
[274:26.67]Idiot.
[274:28.43]you're like a disease you and your kind the doctor takes a step back as if he was afraid of me at the same time a sinister smile appears on his face you don't belong to this land you weren't here when the forest was born you're a splinter a foreign body a vagabond
[274:47.12]And then, the forest and everything else here, these are the antibodies.
[274:51.50]Even the morons from the village.
[274:53.70]Raging white blood cells in an infected bloodstream.
[274:57.02]That's the reason you hide from us.
[275:00.06]The doctor is visibly pleased with himself and his theory.
[275:02.61]His hands are no longer trembling.
[275:03.99]He produces a hand-rolled cigarette and lights it.
[275:07.47]Logical, isn't it?
[275:12.71]That guy sucks.
[275:15.90]I've taken every bone in my body to not just attack.
[275:22.28]But anyways, stuff marked on the... Something must have scared them off from the huge tree.
[275:51.66]Shrine.
[275:52.54]The figure of the shrine bears the signs of teeth.
[275:55.40]It's partially eaten.
[275:59.86]I mean, I eat wood.
[276:00.66]There's nothing wrong with that.
[276:03.52]It's all good.
[276:07.43]A big tree.
[276:08.33]Hold on.
[276:11.99]I don't even want that.
[276:18.77]A doormat with a flower pattern.
[276:22.78]Hold on, it's my daily... It's my daily never ever buy a Razer mouse ever, under any circumstance part of the stream.
[276:31.99]There we go.
[276:34.83]Let me just reattach the glued-on piece.
[276:37.13]Okay.
[276:41.22]The glued on piece that comes off.
[276:43.23]Let me make sure I get that on.
[276:45.69]Let me make sure I get that piece that comes off.
[276:49.83]That's glued on.
[276:52.11]Just that portion of the stream.
[276:53.55]Because it's like irritating me now.
[276:56.86]That's happening to mine too.
[276:58.46]Somebody said.
[277:00.16]What a fantastic product that you should go buy as soon as you can.
[277:05.24]Buy all of them in the store.
[277:06.20]If there's like four of these mice, buy every single one.
[277:22.14]Why did you not get Logitech?
[277:24.44]I don't know.
[277:24.84]Because the old death adder was great.
[277:27.25]And then they glued pieces on.
[277:30.67]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[277:49.68]None of my keys fit.
[277:50.70]Alright, well, I can't get in here.
[277:54.12]Can I go another way?
[277:54.80]I guess I can go this way.
[277:57.22]Oh shit, it's one of those things.
[278:23.75]I'm just keeping out the gun.
[278:25.25]Axe is not... I'm just keeping out the gun, man.
[278:28.96]Like, the axe is not doing it for me right now.
[278:32.32]These things are scaring the shit out of me.
[278:46.88]Uh, what's happening?
[278:47.66]Who's walking?
[279:10.40]Holy fucking hell!
[279:24.41]Where did it go?
[279:25.11]Oh shit, there's a mushroom.
[279:52.84]Where am I going?
[280:00.15]Is somebody camping over here?
[280:01.87]I'm lost in here.
[280:13.29]I'm lost in here.
[280:22.46]Shit.
[280:24.04]I don't like this.
[280:25.85]I really, really don't like this part.
[280:29.75]There's a person in here.
[280:32.69]Who are you?
[280:34.47]Who are you?
[280:39.22]Wait, bloody hell, you're alive!
[280:41.66]The old man extends his hand, blindly trying to reach me.
[280:44.42]You're not from around here, eh?
[280:46.88]You can't be.
[280:48.21]All them lads are dead, it's only me, me and... He finally finds my arm and grabs it.
[280:54.87]For a moment he clutches my hand in silence, then I hear him mumbling under his breath.
[281:00.54]I don't have anything, mate.
[281:02.54]Only this.
[281:03.94]This chair.
[281:06.48]Bloody hell.
[281:08.74]His gaze stops somewhere under the leaky barn ceiling.
[281:12.24]What?! !
[281:12.86]The old man suddenly jumps up.
[281:13.93]What are you saying?
[281:15.13]I feel his long fingernails digging into my hand.
[281:17.87]Ain't no fucking tree.
[281:19.65]It looks like a tree, but those faces.
[281:22.01]I know of buggers.
[281:23.95]Every single one of them so close and so fake.
[281:27.20]They're not real.
[281:27.92]They're not from time to time.
[281:29.12]I thank God I went blind.
[281:31.40]I don't have to look at them.
[281:34.20]The old man lets go of my hand to lean against the broken back of the chair.
[281:37.23]He sighs with relief.
[281:39.45]It disgusts me.
[281:41.01]It fucking disgusts me.
[281:42.97]This buggery, this fucking scum.
[281:45.57]All the time I have to listen to this pathetic blabber.
[281:49.71]Complaining all the time as if I were supposed to believe it's human.
[281:54.65]That it's me, Zoka.
[281:57.45]You're right.
[281:59.79]He suddenly reaches towards me with both hands, almost falling up from the chair.
[282:02.96]He grabs onto my sleeve.
[282:04.36]I feel all his weight.
[282:06.60]You, lad.
[282:07.85]You've got your hands and legs.
[282:10.67]Strong arms.
[282:12.43]I beg of you, get rid of that filth from my village.
[282:16.97]I can't bear another day of that abomination.
[282:19.73]Well, I get sobbing.
[282:21.71]I want to die in peace.
[282:23.92]Fucking hell, I want to die in peace.
[282:27.22]Listen to me.
[282:28.56]I thought about it for a long time.
[282:31.50]I've had a lot of time to think, for fuck's sake.
[282:35.06]His eyes widen, his pupils are milky white.
[282:37.10]I can feel him climbing my coat.
[282:40.71]You need to find a basement.
[282:42.59]Jasik's basement.
[282:44.33]I remember it.
[282:45.97]It's right next to the tree.
[282:49.42]tree is too large so if you can't reach it from the top you've got to try from the bottom find the basement and there surely you'll find the tree's roots the bloody thing must have roots that's where they are destroy them hold them drag them twist the fuck out of them you'll find a way I know you will
[283:10.58]The old man slides down my coat, straight onto his destroyed wheelchair.
[283:16.34]For a moment, he searches for his stone, which he uses to prop himself up against the muddy floor of the barn.
[283:23.35]Thank you.
[283:23.87]Thank you.
[283:26.15]Uh, what's this road?
[283:28.27]The old man grabs the photo, feels it, and then takes out a small glass object from his pocket and puts it to his eye.
[283:34.55]The road home.
[283:35.93]What a load of bullshit.
[283:38.40]The road of madness is what it is.
[283:43.04]No one lives around her anymore.
[283:44.20]Everyone is dead, only sometimes... Sometimes I hear footsteps.
[283:48.84]They wake me up at night.
[283:52.40]Sound of bare feet against the floor and bells of sort.
[283:56.60]They come out of nowhere.
[283:58.08]They move towards the trees, then come back.
[283:59.72]They pass me and fall silent.
[284:01.14]They're like a nightmare, a bloody nightmare.
[284:05.79]If you come across some wheels, two little wheels, so that I could fix my chair, maybe you'd benefit from it as well.
[284:12.29]Two wheels.
[284:12.95]I had tires.
[284:15.55]Years ago, when my eyes were good, people used to pass through here.
[284:19.47]They would leave their huts and go there, where that damn tree grows.
[284:25.86]They would often leave at night so that no one could see them.
[284:29.30]They went into the deep, dark woods and never came back.
[284:32.84]Some of them would say they are going home, but most of them were silent.
[284:38.78]I don't know.
[284:39.30]The land has changed.
[284:40.74]Those trees have cut us off from the rest of the world.
[284:43.98]But home for me has always been here.
[284:47.13]And that monstrous morning abomination grew out of the ground.
[284:50.03]It blocked the passage and that's that.
[284:52.29]No one has managed to pass through since then.
[284:55.49]Maybe people found some other place.
[284:57.84]Maybe they died at the swamp just like us.
[285:02.62]What are you going on about again?
[285:05.59]The wheelchair.
[285:07.15]Oh, the war took me legs.
[285:09.37]Then those wankers burned my house and me pigs.
[285:13.67]But it was years after the war.
[285:16.42]They said it was to fight the disease.
[285:18.64]So they said.
[285:20.00]And my zorka, the disease, took her from me.
[285:22.90]All I have is this wheelchair and this land.
[285:28.76]Used to be different here.
[285:30.59]First the woods changed.
[285:32.01]The trees start sprouting up everywhere.
[285:34.67]with a cough and a waterfall in our fields people went crazy out of hunger they fall out of the food they don't they don't eat those what about what about their legs so destroy the tree I'll handle this grandpa you got any stuff
[286:14.63]Okay.
[286:15.59]Corpse.
[286:37.84]Sickle!
[286:43.61]This area is huge.
[286:46.53]Here's the tree.
[286:55.99]Destroy the tree!
[286:57.59]Alright, I'll take care of it.
[287:17.33]Can I get in here?
[287:22.27]Basement hatch.
[287:23.63]Oh, fuck.
[287:24.33]This is like a side quest.
[287:28.31]The hatch leading to the basement is blocked from the inside.
[287:30.21]The marks on it suggest someone tried to break it open.
[287:41.03]How the fuck do I get in here?
[287:55.31]Is there any other way to go over here?
[288:11.48]The tree is gigantic.
[288:12.58]Its bark stays in constant motion.
[288:15.20]It swells up and collapses into itself, as if breathing.
[288:19.64]I see human silhouettes growing out of the tree trunk.
[288:21.84]They're also moving as if gesturing in slow motion.
[288:25.64]Dozens of mouths repeat their lines simultaneously, creating a uniform, noisy murmur.
[288:31.62]Between the bows, I catch a man's gaze.
[288:35.34]It's fixed on me.
[288:36.40]His body, similarly to the other beings, seems to form an integral part of the tree.
[288:42.22]His limbs are gnarled and his face is grotesquely deformed.
[288:46.04]He's the only one to acknowledge my presence.
[288:47.60]His hand slowly raises, pointing to something on the horizon above the roofs of the destroyed village.
[288:54.25]The man's lips are moving, but the ghastly murmur of the other voices drowns out his words.
[289:00.87]I kick the tree, hoping that the voice will go silent.
[289:04.63]Try to climb the tree.
[289:07.03]Look at the lips of the person talking to me.
[289:10.44]Even though the figure speaks luxuriously, it is too high for me to read the lips properly.
[289:15.76]I think one of the words is radio.
[289:20.93]The bark is slimy and soft.
[289:22.11]Its creases move away from my shoes and hands.
[289:24.41]I feel the arms that protrude from the roots tugging at my clothes.
[289:27.79]I'm not sure if they want to drag me down or pull me closer.
[289:31.59]I barely break free from their grasp.
[289:33.24]Climbing up is out of the question.
[289:35.60]I kick the tree.
[289:37.72]I kick the tree trunk with all my strength, breaking a branch sticking out from between the roots.
[289:43.04]it hurts I hear a silent voice coming from beneath my feet it's a face of a man who's grown into the root he's completely covered in bark his lips barely stick above the mud and his raised arms are some branches one of them is broken in the elbow the stump bleeds a white gooey substance instead of seeping down it slowly flows upward forming a new arm
[290:09.57]So just like a soul tree.
[290:14.57]Examine.
[290:14.97]I notice a little smiling face of a girl gazing at me from behind a cluster of sleeping heads.
[290:19.63]Oblivious to the chaos around her, she studies me with curiosity.
[290:23.19]Just next to her, a massive man calmly hums some melody.
[290:25.76]The lullaby drowns in the overwhelming noise surrounding the tree.
[290:31.66]I'm barely able to make out any conversations and squabbles from the horrible noise of the tree boughs.
[290:36.95]You took everything from us!
[290:39.21]The shouts come from an old man.
[290:41.49]Only the tip of his head and one of his arms stick out from between the tightly crowded bodies.
[290:46.54]You stole it, thieves!
[290:47.68]May the dogs piss on your faces!
[290:51.16]Right next to him, a woman's head, wobbling from side to side, repeats, We were hungry!
[290:55.40]We were hungry!
[290:58.07]Another figure, hiding its face under an enormous root, lets out a chilling shriek.
[291:01.91]Quiet!
[291:02.97]Fucking quiet!
[291:03.73]Leave us in peace!
[291:04.47]Shut up!
[291:07.15]He is interrupted by a man next to him, his intestines hanging up from his stomach.
[291:11.81]It was our common good.
[291:12.83]It was meant for all of us.
[291:14.01]You stole it.
[291:16.71]Are we going to go through every single branch?
[291:20.09]High above, there's another guy that says, Hey, fuck you!
[291:23.26]How dare you!
[291:26.86]High above at the top of the crown, two silhouettes hanging from side to side from their hands and legs grown to the trunk are trying to bite each other's faces off.
[291:35.92]No, it was mine!
[291:37.34]It was mine!
[291:38.64]It actually was mine!
[291:39.98]It was me!
[291:41.08]It's me!
[291:41.66]That was me!
[291:43.36]This is you.
[291:43.82]Alright.
[291:51.65]Is there anything else?
[291:53.63]So the tree is made out of people.
[292:02.04]Potentially lots of people.
[292:04.88]Okay.
[292:08.60]So the real question is... What the hell do I do now?
[292:14.00]Uh, it's time to go home.
[292:16.22]I haven't really collected very much stuff.
[292:29.53]Although I will get another clip tomorrow, hopefully.
[292:31.49]Nothing else.
[292:35.04]I got a couple of things.
[292:39.98]Burn the tree.
[292:41.48]I mean, if I can get down there, I'm going to put some gasoline on it and get rid of the damn thing.
[292:45.72]That's the idea.
[292:48.98]Alright, I think I've got to get back.
[292:52.18]I need, okay, the shovel.
[293:07.43]Rubble.
[293:07.75]Dig in the rubble.
[293:08.49]Okay.
[293:08.93]I can bring the shovel up there.
[293:10.89]Wow.
[293:11.29]I actually did need the shovel.
[293:15.89]Okay.
[293:19.84]I don't even think about it.
[293:23.98]That thing is huge.
[293:27.42]I do not want to fuck with that thing.
[293:29.96]Not at all.
[293:31.44]No thank you.
[293:36.38]No, thank you.
[293:38.50]Stay in your swamp, please.
[293:43.17]What is in the way?
[293:43.87]Alright.
[293:53.68]I need to get the fuck out of here.
[293:54.84]It's like a giant maze over here.
[294:10.42]There's no way anybody saw that.
[294:12.93]Like, it was part of... Look at this.
[294:14.93]This is like the same exact... This is this.
[294:18.99]Okay.
[294:27.83]Let's get out of here.
[294:30.09]I'm gonna go back to my house.
[294:33.76]And then try to find a way to get back into...
[294:37.79]There's a couple of things that they said.
[294:38.93]I want to look at the journal the next morning.
[294:48.78]I'll take the bear trap.
[294:54.98]Okay.
[295:01.20]Back home.
[295:02.58]Hooray.
[295:03.14]Let's craft.
[295:09.31]Antidote.
[295:12.51]Not necessary.
[295:13.89]Let's get rid of the rest of this gas.
[295:15.47]I'm going to cook.
[295:16.87]Bring out the traps.
[295:19.07]Explosive barrel.
[295:21.51]And I still have a battery.
[295:26.29]So, hold on.
[295:26.87]Where's my... Okay, so how are we doing?
[295:33.16]Make another one.
[295:39.15]use this fill up okay this thing's pretty much empty it's taking up space bring the shovel back there tomorrow no I want to go check out the thing alright I gotta cook first why are there so many bear traps but no let's get the enemy again why are there so many bear traps but no bears
[296:06.28]Well, because they're not made for bears in this game.
[296:08.22]They're made for people.
[296:23.73]Well, there's the radio.
[296:24.53]Remember, it was radio, radio.
[296:29.59]That's a lot of essence.
[296:36.75]Ah, so close.
[296:37.65]I need... Ah.
[296:40.26]Damn it.
[296:48.38]So.
[296:49.88]That's barricaded.
[296:51.38]That's cooked.
[296:56.28]Tank is empty.
[296:58.95]Let's begin the process of what I wanted to do last time.
[297:02.31]Last time, there's two traps here.
[297:04.97]This needs to be re-barricaded.
[297:07.17]I need three... Okay, I need more of that shit.
[297:11.83]Of course I do.
[297:12.70]And it's all the way down here.
[297:28.25]Three, six, nine.
[297:29.14]And then I need like 21 of these.
[297:32.68]Just to have in the inventory.
[297:36.76]Okay.
[297:42.93]And what do I have for heals?
[297:44.83]I'll take these three.
[297:47.81]Magazines.
[297:48.69]Lock trick doesn't need to be in here.
[297:49.71]Now I'm just going to try to survive.
[297:51.21]I'll make another one of these.
[297:55.99]And that can stay here.
[297:59.57]Actually, I don't need it.
[298:00.21]I have the pills.
[298:01.19]Okay.
[298:02.95]Boarding stuff up.
[298:04.15]Putting stuff down.
[298:05.17]Alright.
[298:13.46]I'm going to max out my credit card laughing my ass off.
[298:17.83]I would advise against doing that.
[298:26.51]Something tells me that's probably not a smart idea.
[298:32.85]Laughing my ass off.
[298:35.67]Let's board this up.
[298:40.33]Alright, this is full health.
[298:45.97]Full health.
[298:46.79]How is this one doing?
[298:48.01]Didn't get touched.
[298:50.42]Remember, the idea is I'm going to keep this shit open.
[298:54.88]And I'm going to board this one up over here.
[298:58.91]That's the idea.
[298:59.71]I have to pee again really badly, so hopefully this goes well.
[299:05.91]I want to get this here.
[299:08.17]We're going to put... Oh, goddammit.
[299:10.49]It just creeped up on me right here.
[299:16.50]Board this one up.
[299:25.21]Frequent urination problem?
[299:26.43]Well... I've drank almost two full containers of this.
[299:32.41]So... It is a well-oiled machine.
[299:42.88]It's pretty much what I do every stream.
[299:44.82]You just don't see it because I don't... Usually I'm not on camera.
[299:48.45]But this is a scary game day.
[299:50.61]The last four days in a row have been scary.
[299:55.46]Okay, pay attention.
[299:57.99]Trap.
[299:59.43]The only way they can really get in is through here.
[300:02.27]Which, let's just put one here.
[300:04.99]No, no.
[300:06.21]I want this here.
[300:08.71]Right there.
[300:09.33]Because I want to be able to stand behind it.
[300:21.02]Let's do another one.
[300:22.48]No, I don't need to.
[300:27.75]Let's get the heal on there.
[300:31.55]So I can heal.
[300:34.75]Alright.
[300:37.23]I'm ready.
[300:39.31]Now if somebody chases me, I can run up here, go around this corner, and make them walk into this.
[300:48.76]I might even... No, not two.
[300:50.14]That's too much.
[300:54.41]These are good down here.
[300:56.01]This is barricaded here.
[300:57.99]The chair is going to move.
[301:04.41]Actually, just get the damn thing out of the way.
[301:08.21]Because it's just going to cause a problem when the guy eventually comes through the ground.
[301:14.31]We're doing gun.
[301:18.79]Here we go.
[301:30.11]What about the centipede man?
[301:31.71]If centipede man spawns, I'm running into this room and baiting him into the trap.
[301:44.21]Go pee.
[301:44.57]You'll be fine.
[301:45.85]That would be bad if I were just to leave right now.
[301:51.75]And that trap is not sitting right in front of the door.
[301:54.98]So I should be okay.
[301:58.52]We'll see.
[302:03.83]Well, I got three shots in this before I have to reload it.
[302:15.96]Is lemon water intentionally just that bad at making lemonade?
[302:21.94]No, the lemon water is intentional.
[302:24.76]Because I'm currently on a FODMAP diet.
[302:29.98]And I can't have fructose corn syrup.
[302:33.24]I can't have a lot of fruits yet.
[302:36.00]But lemon juice.
[302:38.20]Lemon juice is fine.
[302:39.96]I can put a little bit in water.
[302:41.30]Lime juice in water.
[302:42.22]And it's like drinking a soda.
[302:46.12]Let me have this, okay?
[302:47.36]I know it's not the same thing.
[302:50.50]Is it a dog?
[302:57.55]If it's a dog, it's getting the hammer.
[303:38.76]Alright.
[303:40.94]Why did I move?
[303:41.50]Is that making noise?
[303:51.31]I think that's loud.
[303:58.59]Okay, something's coming into the ground.
[304:01.51]I don't know what that is.
[304:18.34]What the fuck is that thing?
[305:05.11]I just got dropped on.
[305:09.91]That second that door opens... Who opened the door?
[305:11.94]How did you get in that room?
[306:02.69]Multi room strat works.
[306:41.70]Same deal.
[306:42.12]Put in trap there.
[306:43.92]If I get diarrhea'd on, I can go up here.
[306:46.56]Anybody chasing me, I can go up here.
[306:48.00]Say vice versa, throw, go down.
[306:52.60]This is a good spot.
[306:53.74]I think I'll be alright.
[306:56.99]So.
[306:59.13]For this day, I'm going to...
[307:03.92]Okay.
[307:30.83]I saw the village.
[307:31.63]That's the village of the tree.
[307:33.89]Spare parts for the compressor.
[307:36.17]The old journal also included information about a cottage located near the junkyard.
[307:41.50]According to the notes, I would be able to find some spare compressor parts there.
[307:44.76]They might come in handy.
[307:47.56]Broken compressor.
[307:50.86]Going up.
[307:51.22]That's all I got right now.
[307:56.28]That's literally all I got.
[307:59.87]Why no rifle?
[308:01.23]Because I'm afraid to use it because it has five shots.
[308:04.46]And I'll miss three of them.
[308:06.22]And I'm not going to use it until the credits roll.
[308:09.24]Because that's what I do in games like this.
[308:14.48]It would probably come in handy.
[308:17.73]Or the shotgun.
[308:20.65]You know what?
[308:25.35]Shotgun's coming with us.
[308:26.69]We'll use it.
[308:30.60]But I'm gonna pee because it's time to go to the bathroom.
[308:34.22]I'll be right back.
[311:10.54]Hello?
[311:17.60]Wait.
[311:19.40]Every break you gotta apply a little bit more balm.
[311:24.71]What if I just turned the whole thing up like this and just bit the top off and swallowed it?
[311:34.37]I don't think this is low fog map.
[311:42.34]Slime action.
[311:44.70]Okay.
[311:46.02]So today we were going to... I like this strategy.
[311:49.76]This is good.
[311:50.24]We're going to go investigate the cottage upstairs.
[311:53.29]We're going up here.
[311:54.27]Cottage near the junkyard.
[311:56.77]That way.
[312:01.55]Okay.
[312:02.13]Why does this feel strange?
[312:07.82]It feels different.
[312:14.24]Was it backwards?
[312:17.18]I was worried.
[312:17.70]Okay.
[312:19.53]I'm ready to go.
[312:20.07]I don't have to do anything.
[312:21.39]I've got heals.
[312:22.17]I'm going to have to cook this stuff.
[312:25.57]We should be fine.
[312:27.35]I thought I stepped in a trap again.
[312:30.81]I don't want to remove the wood here, so I'm going to go around.
[312:36.44]This stuff, I don't need to dismantle it.
[312:37.78]What's the point of dismantling it when I can just go like this?
[312:43.20]and push this back tonight.
[312:47.96]Good.
[312:50.66]Very cool.
[313:01.48]Turn off the generator.
[313:05.59]Level up.
[313:08.41]We're at probably the final level.
[313:13.86]Adrenaline.
[313:14.66]I will deal double damage in melee when close to death.
[313:19.98]My vitality will increase.
[313:22.60]Once a day, I'll be able to become invisible to enemies if I stay still.
[313:28.39]Healing items will be less effective and my accuracy decreases.
[313:32.05]Oh no, this is... Okay.
[313:37.33]Probably the vitality.
[313:40.29]Or invisibility.
[313:44.98]How long does that last?
[313:52.22]My accuracy will be less effective in shooting.
[313:56.39]How much more, I wonder.
[313:57.81]Done.
[314:13.93]So I've got a little bit more health there.
[314:16.05]That's pretty good.
[314:16.67]I mean, I thought I was really expecting a full cube.
[314:24.69]I don't think a half a cube.
[314:26.69]I feel a little, uh... I feel a little ripped off.
[314:36.80]Alright.
[314:37.62]I haven't even looked in here.
[314:38.44]So.
[314:42.28]I need to craft a few things.
[314:45.12]For instance, I need to talk to the trader down here.
[314:49.24]Buy my daily magazine.
[314:53.28]My daily scrap.
[314:55.24]My daily magazine.
[314:56.46]My daily bullet.
[315:01.02]My daily rags.
[315:03.94]And... That's good.
[315:08.98]I'll move the pills too.
[315:10.70]Yeah.
[315:14.38]Hey, you can have a sickle.
[315:21.41]My daily vroom.
[315:24.25]Alright.
[315:25.35]Let's get the shot- I don't even have a shotgun.
[315:28.10]The shotgun is not here.
[315:34.96]I don't own a shotgun.
[315:38.43]Single shot shotgun.
[315:41.55]Where do I get that, those pliers?
[315:44.80]I haven't seen them at all.
[315:47.70]Single shot shotgun.
[315:50.84]So I need the weapon, I don't have the weapon parts either.
[315:55.49]No, I'm gonna have to keep this the way it is.
[316:11.03]I'll bring the hunting rifle.
[316:19.15]This thing has one shot.
[316:21.17]I'm going to take one bullet with me.
[316:23.80]Extra.
[316:29.20]How many pills do I have?
[316:37.08]Three.
[316:38.91]Uh...
[316:40.37]I'm gonna bring in some wood to eat.
[316:41.61]Give him an advantage.
[316:48.74]I left out the last island.
[316:51.28]Yeah.
[316:53.78]Just eat this down.
[316:57.74]It's not a great heal.
[316:58.67]Actually, it's pretty bad.
[317:03.41]That's really bad.
[317:14.90]Well, unfortunately for me, that's gonna have to do.
[317:23.53]I'm bringing a barrel, too.
[317:25.71]Yeah.
[317:26.69]And... No, I'm not going that way yet.
[317:30.29]I'll bring... Yeah.
[317:30.93]Just in case there's something else.
[317:33.56]Block picks.
[317:34.34]A couple of batteries.
[317:35.30]My watch.
[317:36.50]I don't think I need this many magazines.
[317:40.36]But, uh... No.
[317:43.46]Yes, I do.
[317:52.66]Do you remember?
[317:53.00]It looks like the guy who gave me the wrong order at Olive Garden.
[318:02.08]I would get your order right every time.
[318:04.27]That looks good.
[318:05.01]I got some peels.
[318:05.81]I got pills.
[318:06.59]I've got bread.
[318:10.25]Guys, I've got never-ending garlic bread from Olive Garden.
[318:15.93]We're going up here.
[318:17.77]Let's try it.
[318:18.27]Let's see what I can do.
[318:27.94]investigate up here we go whoops that's just good stuff I'll take it
[318:55.30]Why did I?
[318:55.66]I don't know why I did that.
[318:56.46]Just eat some fucking never-ending garlic wood.
[319:22.19]I used it.
[319:23.27]At least I used it.
[319:38.49]Alright, no more wood.
[319:39.25]I don't need to take it anymore.
[319:40.48]Alright, look for a compressor thing, right?
[319:53.55]That's a hidden bear trap.
[319:56.55]I'll take it.
[320:03.53]I'm starting to run out of space already.
[320:05.29]No, no, don't take the wood.
[320:07.07]I can go on like a scavenge if I need to for the wooden... and the mushrooms and shit.
[320:12.90]No.
[320:13.64]No, it's not necessary.
[320:27.57]He spits!
[320:34.62]Die, motherfucker!
[320:44.55]I used it.
[321:00.63]It's too hard to see that shit.
[321:02.60]It really is.
[321:06.58]How many bullets does it take to kill one of those?
[321:08.19]How... I gotta go up really... Is that... That's not even... That's out of the bounds!
[321:16.77]That's out of the map!
[321:26.15]This accuracy is actually really, really starting to be a pain in the ass.
[321:32.56]Oh, I don't want to scavenge for it another time.
[321:38.24]Oh, I'm here now.
[321:40.80]This looks like... I thought this was out of bounds.
[321:48.98]Eat a piece of wood.
[321:57.43]What the fuck is that?
[322:02.27]What is that?
[322:13.77]I'm poisoned?
[322:14.59]I ain't fucking with that thing.
[322:24.45]Just put it on the hotbar.
[322:27.80]I'm gonna be chewing on wood this whole time.
[322:29.54]Oh, I can't do it from the hotbar.
[322:39.88]It's an alien artifact.
[322:43.77]Alright, there's apparently some cottage near a junkyard over here.
[322:46.77]Another one of these?
[322:59.66]Okay, I'm at the sawmill.
[323:02.20]I don't understand what I'm supposed to do about those things.
[323:16.77]This map is lying to me right now.
[323:24.54]I got it.
[323:41.31]Mushrooms.
[323:41.73]I have to watch out for...
[323:47.62]Oh, it's the doctor again.
[323:50.56]He looks... bad.
[323:54.75]This land hides more secrets than your little fucking rat brain is capable of understanding.
[324:00.39]The doctor digs through the mud.
[324:01.69]I think he's looking for something.
[324:03.75]Deep underground, there's a current of electricity.
[324:06.53]Fucking electricity.
[324:08.19]He starts flailing his arms around, wildly throwing pieces of mud everywhere around him.
[324:12.43]And it flows underground from tree to tree.
[324:15.78]The doctor suddenly freezes, staring at me with his arms mid-air.
[324:19.00]And it powers everything.
[324:20.40]It connects it all.
[324:22.18]If I had a light bulb, if I just screwed it into one of these branches, it would light up.
[324:26.76]I bet it fucking would.
[324:28.78]He bends over a small hole in the mud and continues digging.
[324:31.86]Maybe this is where you're hiding.
[324:33.08]Maybe this is the way.
[324:33.94]Bolt handle.
[324:38.48]Bolt handle.
[324:44.08]Should I get the bolt handle?
[324:46.12]Or a weapon part?
[324:51.79]I don't know which one to do.
[324:53.97]Do the embryo instead?
[325:00.49]The bolt handle is a weapon part.
[325:03.58]That's a shitload of bad.
[325:04.48]That's like 2,000, 3,000 essence.
[325:09.58]Whatever I can make with the bolt handle, I'll try to make it.
[325:13.50]let's go got it can you hear the trees sing they're calling us they're showing us the way they're showing us the way all at the same time blocking it I can't understand it he kicks a stone are they trying to tell us something are they putting us to a test I don't know maybe they're lost too and don't know what to do he shakes his head dispirited and goes silent
[325:40.62]Still got that cigarette, though.
[325:41.90]After a long pause, he turns toward me.
[325:43.39]His glasses are so dirty, I can barely see the eyes hiding beneath them.
[325:48.61]I see you haven't regained your speech.
[325:50.49]You need to find another doctor.
[325:54.20]I haven't slept a wink in many days.
[325:55.60]I don't think this is good for me.
[325:57.34]I hear this voice all the time.
[325:59.72]Can you hear it?
[326:01.22]Her heavenly voice.
[326:02.06]The doctor stares right into my eyes.
[326:05.58]Mud drips from his face.
[326:06.52]He hasn't blinked in over a minute.
[326:08.46]No, you don't.
[326:09.17]Why would you?
[326:09.69]You don't know her.
[326:11.71]He steps towards me and lowers his voice.
[326:14.11]I'm a bit fed up with her.
[326:15.17]I bit.
[326:15.97]A little tiny bit.
[326:17.75]She must know I'm heading her way.
[326:19.01]I'm doing everything I can.
[326:21.76]I don't eat I don't sleep I search under every rock under every fucking bush she must understand it she must give me some time some little time off tell her this will you you're kind of losing it here the doctor is lost in thoughts a cigarette sticks out of his mud-covered mouth he's if it remains of his shoe he draws lines on the ground they seem to intersect in completely random places I'm waiting
[326:48.51]He doesn't stop drawing, he moves away a bit and makes a wide arc with his heel for... The doctor flicks his cigarette into the dirt, stomps on it, and drags it along the ground creating the last straight line.
[327:00.24]You.
[327:02.00]Fuck, drawing was never my forte.
[327:09.86]Okay, doc.
[327:13.47]Goodbye.
[327:19.65]fish come on oh shit alright I can't cook that uh who are you who are you
[327:46.18]I'm here.
[327:47.48]Are you trapped?
[327:49.44]I'm here.
[327:49.84]I'm here.
[327:50.22]I'm trapped.
[327:51.40]I might be trapped.
[327:52.10]I'm trapped.
[327:52.56]I'm here.
[327:52.92]I hear.
[327:54.73]Hear her.
[327:55.25]I hear her.
[327:57.91]I hear.
[328:01.29]Cut me loose.
[328:08.72]I can't.
[328:09.18]I tried.
[328:13.48]What is that?
[328:15.38]A giant snail.
[328:23.36]What the fuck is that?
[328:36.83]Apparently, this is the cottage.
[328:40.05]The shell is cracked.
[328:40.93]Maybe I could break it open.
[328:49.45]But, hold on.
[328:50.79]Should I do that?
[328:52.20]What if it comes out?
[329:05.52]Whoa!
[329:08.56]The roof beneath the shell is completely destroyed.
[329:10.62]The snail shell is probably also badly damaged.
[329:13.78]Maybe I'll be able to get inside the cottage through the skin on his belly.
[329:16.64]It seems quite frail.
[329:36.22]Who are you?
[329:39.40]The snail's speech is incredibly slow and slurred.
[329:44.38]He moves his jaw with great effort.
[329:45.72]It looks like it's about to fall off.
[329:48.48]His eyes sag from their sockets.
[329:50.20]They dangle from side to side, trying to keep me in their sight.
[329:52.52]Why are you disturbing my first rest?
[330:04.26]His right eye raises with great effort and wobbles.
[330:08.55]Your face.
[330:10.87]What happened to your face?
[330:14.59]And your hair looks like shit today, manlet.
[330:22.42]I'm sorry, I've been drinking the chemicals out of the stove again.
[330:31.00]The snail's jaw falls so low it almost detaches itself from the rest of the body.
[330:35.77]You scared me.
[330:37.31]You barely resemble a human.
[330:41.64]You should cover yourself.
[330:46.57]Suddenly, I feel a subtle shiver beneath my feet.
[330:49.46]The snail's body livens up.
[330:52.74]Quiet, you hear that?
[330:54.88]Do you hear that voice?
[330:57.24]The snail tucks his head inside his shell.
[330:59.82]She calls to me.
[331:02.29]Can you hear it?
[331:04.39]She's calling to me.
[331:05.65]I'm here, trapped, bound.
[331:13.72]The snail falls silent for a longer moment.
[331:15.50]The inside of the shell is almost completely silent.
[331:17.86]The snail's body suddenly leans forward.
[331:20.88]The wooden construction of the cottage creaks under his huge bulk.
[331:23.98]I barely keep my balance
[331:28.86]cut me loose please I need to get out of here if you release me I will leave come back tomorrow and I won't be here anymore you can live in my home you'll like it you just need to cut me loose the snail falls silent
[331:56.28]His enormous head slowly drops to the shell.
[331:58.75]Giant gleaming drops of mucus appear on his slimy skin.
[332:03.73]You need to understand my predicament.
[332:08.61]I'm unable to do anything by myself.
[332:13.34]My legs are numb from lying here.
[332:17.02]I can't feel my arms at all.
[332:19.34]I admit that lying in the sun gives me this strange pleasure.
[332:24.11]But it's time for me to go.
[332:29.11]Understand, I love you.
[332:30.63]That's not what that says.
[332:32.35]Understand, I have to.
[332:33.77]Photo of the road.
[332:42.33]You're going there too?
[332:43.79]Uh-huh.
[332:46.46]Everyone is going there.
[332:49.08]It's the road home after all.
[332:54.20]Once there was a beautiful clearing, now everything's covered in water.
[332:59.68]And I've lost my gumboots.
[333:03.58]Do you have any gumboots on you?
[333:08.41]You're so ugly, I feel like puking.
[333:12.95]You barely resemble a human being.
[333:15.79]That fucking worked today.
[333:22.94]It was yesterday.
[333:25.08]Or a few days ago, maybe.
[333:27.71]A year?
[333:29.25]I woke up in front of the house.
[333:31.49]I thought I was dreaming.
[333:34.17]I took a step and fell down.
[333:36.27]I fell straight through the roof.
[333:39.36]How did this happen?
[333:46.12]Fuck off.
[333:47.40]Alright, so I have to cut him loose.
[333:55.40]Throw it beneath the shells, please.
[333:56.38]Throw it on the snow.
[333:57.50]So, how do I cut him loose?
[334:09.79]Pour salt on him.
[334:12.17]You maniac!
[334:23.66]The window is blocked by rubble.
[334:24.64]I must find a different way inside.
[334:25.88]How do I cut him?
[334:32.56]Where did he want me to cut him loose from?
[334:35.57]His shell?
[334:44.39]The root beneath the shell is completely destroyed.
[334:45.95]The root beneath the shell is completely destroyed.
[334:49.03]The snail shell is probably also badly damaged.
[334:50.67]Maybe I should throw the skin on his belly.
[335:00.38]It looks like a human hand, but it's sticky and grown into the shell.
[335:05.53]A key grows out of the palm.
[335:06.93]I should be able to easily tear it off.
[335:12.47]Key found.
[335:13.17]Shed key.
[335:21.10]Key to the shed.
[335:28.26]Where's there a sh... a shed?
[335:45.55]How do I get him off?
[335:49.43]Maybe a knife?
[335:51.34]No... Some kind of organic cords.
[336:03.57]They're slowly pulsating.
[336:04.47]They're surprisingly hard and durable.
[336:17.75]Some kind of cord.
[336:21.15]Some kind of cord.
[336:22.05]Some kind of cord.
[336:23.91]Some kind of cord.
[336:35.30]Organic cord.
[336:39.68]Is this like... Should I kill... I can't go anywhere else over here.
[336:43.00]I would think I'd have to follow this around somewhere.
[336:55.02]Oh, look!
[337:05.31]Food.
[337:08.05]Note.
[337:09.97]Bear trap, many nails, and planks.
[337:11.72]Some useful scrap metal.
[337:14.04]Gun.
[337:14.48]Oh, this is it.
[337:15.42]Okay.
[337:21.49]Useful scrap metal.
[337:23.55]Gun parts at sea.
[337:26.25]Ropes, tapes, antlers, some tools, scrap metal.
[337:30.44]An old compressor.
[337:33.78]F. F. Right here.
[337:42.33]Yep.
[338:01.03]Tools maybe equals pliers.
[338:04.73]So I don't understand this though.
[338:07.93]Maybe can I just not do this?
[338:09.29]Or do I have to do something?
[338:10.25]There's a snail over here.
[338:15.32]It's getting late.
[338:15.94]I need to figure this out before I leave though.
[338:19.36]Wardrobe.
[338:20.56]Door.
[338:25.20]I mean I could cut him in the stomach.
[338:28.85]But I don't want to kill him.
[338:31.00]Isn't that going to... won't that kill him?
[338:36.62]That's... Everyone... A bunch of people just said... Caught his stomach open.
[338:41.12]It's like, that's going to kill him.
[338:48.38]Let me see this one more time.
[338:52.23]Do you have any gumboots?
[338:59.44]He says, cut me loose.
[339:04.64]Dude, I can't... I'll come back.
[339:06.92]I'm running out of time.
[339:12.25]No, I gotta go.
[339:39.66]That's not doing anything.
[339:44.12]I feel like there's something- I'm gonna have to leave.
[339:56.98]What the f- Fuck.
[340:03.12]Alright, it's something to do with this.
[340:42.55]Close!
[340:52.07]I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
[340:54.07]Am I supposed to cut this?
[341:00.46]Is this letting him go?
[341:02.10]I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.
[341:10.02]I don't have time to know either.
[341:14.33]What am I trying to do here?
[341:17.23]Like, block the light?
[341:18.35]I don't have time to do this.
[341:24.19]Am I trying to have... I don't know what this... What is this?
[341:27.74]Is this a place to go up here?
[341:38.86]What?!
[341:39.98]I gotta... I have to leave!
[341:43.07]I thought I was supposed to cut the cord.
[341:46.57]I'm fucked.
[341:47.77]What am I supposed to do now?
[341:48.91]I am so much trouble.
[342:05.00]What's over here?
[342:06.88]I'm dead.
[342:07.98]Cut it.
[342:08.36]Cut it.
[342:10.04]Cut the... Cut it.
[342:11.58]Cut it.
[342:11.96]Here it is.
[342:12.46]Cut it.
[342:15.68]A weird pulsating road looks delicate.
[342:19.68]I freed the snail.
[342:20.56]Go!
[342:34.72]What if I stay in the snail's stomach?
[342:43.40]What if I stay in here?
[342:46.55]I feel free again.
[342:47.52]When you return here tomorrow, I won't be here anymore.
[342:49.32]I'll follow her voice and you'll be able to live here.
[342:51.51]I promise.
[343:30.00]Where's the house?
[343:32.80]I'm dead.
[343:58.59]Hurry the fuck up and go through swim, you fucking baby!
[344:37.91]I don't care!
[344:38.45]I have to go the fastest route.
[344:41.25]I don't care.
[344:42.15]It's poison.
[344:42.87]I'll get over it.
[344:44.03]I'm pretty much immune to it at this point.
[344:47.57]It's happened so many times.
[344:54.08]I gotta turn on the generator!
[345:04.83]Turn it on before it gets to be too dark!
[345:08.15]What is that?
[345:08.73]It's an alien.
[345:09.29]Okay, go.
[345:10.63]Through house.
[345:12.77]No, I have to go through.
[345:16.81]I have to go through this side.
[345:18.53]Because remember.
[345:19.35]48.
[345:19.37]50.
[345:22.18]Right at the fucking last second.
[345:36.34]Oh, fuck.
[345:56.67]I got heals, right?
[345:57.52]I have one heal.
[346:01.01]Have any more wood?
[346:01.65]Eat it.
[346:21.31]No, you fucking fool!
[346:24.01]You fool!
[346:25.57]You fool!
[346:27.21]You were supposed to board it!
[346:28.83]Oh, I can't.
[346:49.37]I think I have to do gun for this.
[346:53.78]Yeah, I'm, uh, gone.
[346:55.60]Hello?
[347:14.08]Fuck, he got in.
[347:18.81]Trap!
[347:19.41]A trap!
[347:24.61]What the hell are you thinking, Jeremy?
[347:33.06]Somebody's pushing it.
[347:34.28]Who's pushing it?
[347:34.94]Who's pushing it?
[347:35.96]Is somebody... Is he dead?
[347:48.00]Do I have enough bullets?
[347:57.19]Oh, this is bad.
[347:58.39]I'm making so much fucking noise.
[348:11.99]Wood.
[348:12.71]Eat wood.
[348:13.07]I'm gonna fucking blow this place to hell.
[349:13.20]Do the scream.
[349:23.72]Alright.
[349:47.85]Wait, there's still an hour.
[349:48.65]There's still an hour, guys.
[349:51.21]This ain't done.
[349:54.14]Is it a dog coming in?
[349:55.26]26.
[349:55.28]250 rep.
[350:18.00]Alright.
[350:18.74]I can't believe I did it.
[350:19.72]I can't believe I made it.
[350:26.52]Time to move my house.
[350:28.50]To the snail house.
[350:46.37]Same deal.
[350:47.73]All the things that I like.
[350:53.89]Now, I did get a weapon part.
[350:56.15]So... Let me... Just let me check that out.
[351:09.82]I need to cook.
[351:12.73]Let's be chefs.
[351:17.19]960 essence.
[351:17.63]It's not very much.
[351:21.99]The bolt is for a rifle.
[351:23.95]I kind of already have one, huh?
[351:25.09]Well, I guess I could sell it after I make it.
[351:26.79]Or I could just sell the part.
[351:27.61]Alright, workbench.
[351:32.07]It's not even... I don't even have access to it.
[351:49.98]225, though, it sells for.
[351:52.24]Good ammo.
[351:55.74]On the rifle.
[351:57.94]I could use a couple more batteries.
[352:01.88]If I'm honest.
[352:04.90]Alright, we have traps.
[352:05.94]I have two traps.
[352:06.78]That should be good for the next night.
[352:09.02]I'm gonna use... I'm gonna fill some gasoline up.
[352:13.31]I need a couple more batteries.
[352:16.19]How do I make batteries?
[352:17.17]Can I?
[352:17.41]No.
[352:17.75]No.
[352:20.13]Oh, should I take... I'm going to take these heals.
[352:25.15]Do I have the... Yeah, actually, they're right here.
[352:27.19]I'd rather do this.
[352:28.47]Take the good ones.
[352:31.60]Alright, spare parts.
[352:35.70]I got lots of spare parts now.
[352:38.50]Rotten mushrooms.
[352:40.20]Oh, shit.
[352:40.70]They sat in there for too long, didn't they?
[352:43.12]Fuck.
[352:43.52]Whatever.
[352:45.05]I'll bring one of these.
[352:46.25]Bring in the shovel, too, just in case.
[352:48.21]We're gonna fill up the other... We're gonna use the gasoline.
[352:52.11]Heals.
[352:53.61]Food.
[352:55.25]And, uh, bullets.
[352:57.45]I'll take two.
[353:01.23]That makes sense to me.
[353:02.13]Alright, let's go.
[353:04.69]Repair the axe?
[353:06.39]I don't think... No, it doesn't need it yet.
[353:08.83]Waste.
[353:11.59]Now I have a new house.
[353:15.24]This is true.
[353:17.62]So should I just... Run with a bunch of stuff to the new house?
[353:25.46]Is the cottage not a hideout?
[353:29.13]Oh, the cottage is not a hideout.
[353:30.91]Oh, shit.
[353:31.73]Okay, well, that's good to know.
[353:34.11]Alright, that's good.
[353:36.83]Let's refill some of this stuff.
[353:38.36]Let's just get rid of the rest of this.
[353:46.94]And then let's fill up the generator.
[353:51.00]How much is in the generator?
[353:51.82]Yeah, I could use it.
[353:54.81]Ugh.
[354:15.50]top this off.
[354:17.50]Alright, cool.
[354:21.02]I'm good.
[354:22.50]I've already dealt with you, but is there anything else I need?
[354:30.83]I'll take a pill.
[354:32.61]Yeah.
[354:34.31]Yeah.
[354:35.23]Give me some more pills.
[354:38.29]Alright, let's go up to the house, the snail house, because now it's another day, so it's technically you shouldn't be there anymore.
[354:45.67]Let's go.
[354:46.09]I want to examine that.
[354:47.57]I turned off the generator, right?
[354:53.78]Can 2,000 of you confirm?
[354:58.51]Prepare the windows.
[355:00.69]Oh.
[355:01.57]Smart.
[355:03.03]Smart.
[355:13.64]How's this one doing?
[355:15.00]I'll just put them all up.
[355:16.10]I'm just gonna redo the whole thing.
[355:23.72]Fucking stupid eye!
[355:37.69]Let's get all the wood.
[355:38.57]I should have enough to do at least enough nails, too.
[355:42.97]Okay.
[355:44.61]Kinda runnin' out of nails.
[355:45.49]Let's see what I can do with this.
[355:51.25]I need more wood, shit.
[356:06.09]Wait, I gotta grind him up.
[356:17.54]You know, got enough gas for me to do that.
[356:19.26]Come on.
[356:31.49]Jeremy, you ever think about taking the L?
[356:33.33]Like, taking the loss?
[356:34.33]I mean, what do you mean?
[356:37.94]I'm like... I'm like probably an hour or two away from beating the game.
[356:41.00]Why would I take a loss right now?
[356:54.98]Good do I have enough I do not have enough do I know I need more nails That's okay.
[357:02.01]I can finish this when I come back because it's just these it's just this door here I'm gonna retrap though That's the way that we're going to do this I have to in there too, okay, I
[357:26.83]One, two... Make another one.
[357:33.08]Three should do it.
[357:34.86]I think I'm happy with three.
[357:40.02]Yeah, threes should be fine.
[357:56.86]So, in the usual places.
[357:58.58]I also wanted batteries too, but I don't think I... Can I not make batteries?
[358:08.07]Okay...
[358:28.08]And then I do, I want one up here.
[358:31.90]Please remind me that this exists again.
[358:35.12]I will cause a huge problem if I do not know.
[358:41.42]And I'm gonna, I have time to put this over here.
[358:54.06]I'm gonna go in the light getting through.
[358:56.84]We move.
[359:00.71]How's my inventory look?
[359:02.07]Actually, pretty dog shit, so hold on.
[359:05.84]Got enough bullets.
[359:06.88]This is my healing boards.
[359:12.32]My pills.
[359:14.55]My batteries.
[359:15.39]My shovel.
[359:17.17]My piss bottle.
[359:19.29]It's a little kind of... I'm kind of overkilling the healing here.
[359:21.65]Yeah, overkilling the healing.
[359:22.83]Get this out of here.
[359:39.30]Off we go Let's check out the snail hut see what's in there now
[360:17.19]Almost stepped in it, but I didn't.
[360:26.46]Where the fuck is the snail?
[360:28.02]He's gone.
[360:32.08]He went away.
[360:32.72]At least he told me he went away.
[360:35.00]He might have been a liar.
[360:36.08]We'll find out.
[360:36.90]What if he's still there?
[360:37.64]Yeah, he said he was gonna leave.
[360:43.09]Yeah, he should be gone.
[360:46.07]better be or he's got a real soft belly is what I've been told I need some wood it's actually a good opportunity to take wooden nails okay here we go let's see what's in this place
[361:20.84]Up in the snail cavern.
[361:22.66]Here we go.
[361:27.45]Did he leave?
[361:46.88]He left.
[362:05.91]Radio Expensive shit.
[362:12.35]No.
[362:13.47]Math location found.
[362:14.49]Radio tower.
[362:17.69]No, leave the rope.
[362:18.54]It's useless to me.
[362:24.54]A lot of rusty radio equipment is strewn on the floor.
[362:26.78]Old recorders and destroyed tapes.
[362:28.76]Everything's covered in goo dripping from the leaky ceiling.
[362:33.79]dead body the dry corpse overgrown with small roots okay so I got the map I got the radio tower oh my god that's so far away
[363:04.80]I guess we go to the radio tower.
[363:14.30]Is that the snail?
[363:17.21]That's everything that's in it.
[363:18.13]Oh, notebooks.
[363:20.49]We have nothing to eat since the flood.
[363:21.91]I've caught some snails and frogs.
[363:24.19]Better this than nothing.
[363:25.05]I'm out of the crosswords I found last year in the old wardrobe at the junkyard.
[363:30.83]The only thing that's left is to continue writing the journal and listening to the strange radio.
[363:35.34]In two days I will visit the junkyard again.
[363:37.12]Maybe I'll finally find a tape recorder or something that will allow me to record this weird signal.
[363:40.88]If there's some meaning behind it.
[363:45.47]hungry I'm eating grass and whatever I find in the water I've seen some strange men between the trees they're not locals they do not hide they were dressed in strange clothes but I was too far to take a better look besides I'm alone and there were at least three of them maybe I'm delusional maybe these old ruins aren't empty
[364:07.92]I found a blank tape and a broken tape recorder.
[364:09.74]Maybe I can fix it and do something with it.
[364:11.54]I've also found some other useful things.
[364:14.68]I've written them down and left them for father.
[364:17.62]Later.
[364:18.78]I don't have the strength to wear them all on my back.
[364:22.27]Is it possible that the radio tower emits this strange signal?
[364:24.69]It's been a couple of years since it's been turned over.
[364:27.41]The woods have blocked the way to it.
[364:30.69]But no other signal reaches this place from outside.
[364:32.83]It must be that tower.
[364:35.59]I need to take a break from this radio.
[364:36.95]I hear this voice everywhere.
[364:38.03]It's strangely familiar.
[364:39.07]I can't get it out of my head.
[364:44.62]You.
[364:47.38]Are you here?
[365:37.11]Okay.
[365:40.21]So I can't... the radio tower... I can't get to the radio tower?
[365:44.47]But the junkyard... I can read this now.
[365:57.89]Where's the compressor parts?
[366:05.42]The junkyard?
[366:07.32]So that's, like, down here.
[366:09.78]That was wild.
[366:26.05]Well, hold on, let me look at the journal one more time.
[366:28.39]I need, like, my item, like, notes.
[366:35.93]No, not this one.
[366:38.45]This one.
[366:40.21]Scrap metal and old compressor was F, which is up here.
[366:45.68]But is that up this way?
[366:47.46]Am I in it right now?
[366:53.51]Or is that, like, up here?
[367:05.00]It's probably the map.
[367:07.22]Yeah, that makes sense.
[367:08.00]I'm going to get the compressor.
[367:10.70]Sticking with the plan.
[367:20.28]Or junkyard?
[367:21.73]Or map?
[367:24.03]I mean, the junkyard is right here.
[367:30.21]Might as well just take a look at it.
[367:32.03]See what's over here.
[367:48.48]Junkyard It's a map of the junkyard, okay F so we need to go in the top right corner of the junkyard Like up here Oh I have to dig
[368:12.83]Need point three.
[368:14.75]Have point four.
[368:17.15]Is this the right spot, though?
[368:18.45]There's another spot over there.
[368:29.65]Do it.
[368:38.15]Oh, yes!
[368:43.60]Got it.
[368:48.04]Do this one too.
[368:48.92]Wait, what else is up here?
[368:49.70]Uh... F. Is scrap metal and old compressor and clothes.
[369:00.73]Clothes.
[369:02.37]Broken axe, empty bottles.
[369:04.41]Some fine quality clothing at H. F. B. C.
[369:14.01]One of these is H. Which one?
[369:15.71]The one right below me?
[369:18.77]A, B, C... A, B, C, D, E... Or is it that one?
[369:27.07]Do I even have enough to do this again?
[369:29.88]I don't.
[369:30.34]I can't do it again.
[369:32.68]I got what I needed.
[369:33.38]I got what I came for.
[369:34.22]Time to go fix the compressor.
[369:40.86]Nice.
[369:44.62]Go get the fine clothes.
[369:45.86]I have to dig.
[369:49.24]Don't I have to dig in here?
[369:50.69]My shovel's... I don't have to dig?
[369:52.71]What are you talking about?
[370:00.03]My shovel don't work no more.
[370:05.92]I'm running out of space, too.
[370:07.80]I guess I pick it up.
[370:11.18]No, will you?
[370:13.12]What the fuck happened to it?
[370:15.12]Okay, I'll make a lockpick.
[370:25.83]Wait, rocket wreckage.
[370:30.98]Oh no.
[370:41.07]Oh no, it's him.
[370:42.23]He didn't make it.
[370:43.91]He did not make it.
[370:45.03]I'm gonna make some heals.
[370:51.46]No room in inventory.
[370:52.30]What the fuck do I get rid of?
[370:57.38]Stumps.
[370:59.72]I have to get rid of this lockpick I just made.
[371:02.04]Who cares?
[371:04.71]That's sad.
[371:05.29]This long gun...
[371:13.22]Take the scrap.
[371:14.54]I want this long barrel.
[371:17.94]Let's just, like, see what this does.
[371:19.02]Who cares?
[371:26.63]Long barrel.
[371:27.91]Weapon part.
[371:28.99]Scrap.
[371:29.83]Compressor.
[371:34.57]I need the stumps, though.
[371:36.19]And I need the nails.
[371:38.71]The wood.
[371:39.77]For the weapon part.
[371:40.47]This is worth so much money.
[371:43.42]Nice.
[371:43.78]Alright, I'm out.
[371:48.20]That's sad.
[371:52.65]He didn't make it.
[371:54.01]Unfortunately.
[371:57.49]I have to go this way.
[372:07.30]Alright, come on.
[372:07.80]Let's do this.
[372:09.76]I can search.
[372:10.92]Wait, what?
[372:15.60]I can search both wreckages.
[372:23.37]What the fuck?
[372:24.45]I mean, I got no room for it, though.
[372:26.59]What is this thing?
[372:28.47]Tubular magazine?
[372:29.63]I don't have any space for this.
[372:30.73]I... I just gotta come back.
[372:43.60]I'll come back later.
[372:47.01]It's getting late, I gotta get out of here.
[372:52.35]I can't- I have two complete items that I was looking for so bad.
[372:58.38]It's not like it's gonna fly away.
[373:00.14]That's true.
[373:07.90]That's... that's... terrible.
[373:11.77]Did runner already?
[373:12.61]Yes, I did.
[373:20.75]Hello.
[373:29.53]No, just don't.
[373:30.19]I can't take it.
[373:30.57]I have to leap.
[373:43.87]Almost down here.
[373:45.23]Bear trap.
[373:47.31]Watch it.
[373:54.71]Grabbing the nails.
[373:56.81]That's all I'm looking for right now.
[374:04.95]Board up the stuff.
[374:07.45]Live another day.
[374:09.41]And then I'm going to fix the compressor.
[374:14.24]And upgrade the barracks.
[374:20.62]Right.
[374:22.66]I remembered this time.
[374:24.58]Examine.
[374:25.24]Where is it?
[374:25.66]Over here?
[374:26.12]Let's just put this away first.
[374:29.76]Let's upgrade the workbench.
[374:34.51]I need three wires.
[374:38.33]Of course I do.
[374:39.81]I can make a shotgun now, though.
[374:41.73]That actually doesn't break.
[374:42.70]Okay.
[374:53.41]Let me go.
[374:54.11]Let's put the compressor in.
[374:55.31]Get the rag.
[374:59.45]No.
[375:02.45]Give me the... What am I doing?
[375:11.40]Lockpick.
[375:12.90]I need to make this wood.
[375:13.94]I need gas.
[375:16.63]I need pliers later.
[375:20.85]Hunting rifle can stay.
[375:22.16]I need batteries.
[375:23.10]Put the long rifle away.
[375:25.82]Gas.
[375:27.30]Alright.
[375:29.10]I have no idea what's going to happen.
[375:31.06]We'll find out.
[375:50.39]Cool.
[375:58.68]Six hours?
[375:59.26]Yeah.
[376:02.12]We're just going to go until this is done.
[376:06.28]I feel like I've got a little more.
[376:10.16]I've got probably another couple hours, maybe.
[376:11.96]But we're just going to go until this is done.
[376:17.21]I think that's the best idea.
[376:18.21]Alright, so.
[376:19.93]Compressor.
[376:21.73]Here you are.
[376:22.67]Repair.
[376:28.73]Working compressor.
[376:32.29]I could refill any empty oxygen tanks here.
[376:34.57]I don't have any empty oxygen tanks.
[376:40.37]Oxygen tanks?
[376:45.96]Rusty oxygen tanks.
[376:47.30]They're useless.
[376:55.62]Well, shit.
[377:02.61]Okay.
[377:04.93]I've got my weapons.
[377:06.29]I'm almost ready to board up for the night.
[377:08.15]I'm going to cook this.
[377:09.89]Store the weapon parts.
[377:11.61]No, keep the wood because I need it to board up in case something bad happens.
[377:16.06]I don't need this many nails, though.
[377:18.48]Not like it matters.
[377:22.58]Still have heals.
[377:25.42]Batteries.
[377:26.68]Put the rags away.
[377:28.07]And it's time.
[377:30.47]It's time.
[377:32.35]Peter.
[377:34.61]Peter.
[377:35.09]What are you guys saying?
[377:36.13]Peter.
[377:41.09]Uh, I'll switch it on now.
[377:44.29]No, I don't need to do that now.
[377:47.69]Yeah, yeah, just do it now.
[377:49.11]No, it's a waste.
[377:50.45]Nah, it's a waste.
[377:51.97]It's a waste, it's a waste, it's a waste, it's a waste, it's a waste.
[377:54.86]Let me make sure everything's ready to go.
[377:59.20]So, this door is boarded, boarded, boarded.
[378:01.44]Traps, traps.
[378:03.00]Trap, exploding barrel.
[378:05.20]Thing over here.
[378:09.94]Same scenario.
[378:11.86]Gonna hang out down here.
[378:16.39]Put this back.
[378:25.65]Don't want light coming through.
[378:27.21]So that's a little bit of light going through.
[378:34.95]I think that's good.
[378:36.99]It's that.
[378:37.33]That's fine.
[378:37.75]Alright.
[378:39.57]This is going to be moved over here.
[378:45.34]Actually, that's alright right there.
[378:47.50]Here we go.
[378:54.08]You know what?
[378:56.18]Board it up.
[378:58.64]I don't want them walking in here.
[379:01.02]Close the doors.
[379:01.56]Board it up.
[379:10.57]I didn't cook the mushroom.
[379:12.57]I did not cook it.
[379:14.70]I did not.
[379:16.50]This time.
[379:41.84]I did not.
[379:42.42]I did not cook the mushroom.
[379:43.90]I did not.
[379:45.48]I did not.
[379:55.25]Did I really say it like that?
[379:56.39]I don't think I did.
[380:07.51]Come on.
[380:18.85]Okay.
[381:02.40]Why am I not saying anything?
[381:05.04]Because my brain can only do one thing at a time.
[381:08.49]I have to concentrate when I'm doing something like this.
[381:11.33]I can't speak.
[381:22.18]I love cynical Jerma.
[381:25.08]What do you mean?
[381:26.86]I'm incredibly optimistic.
[381:28.26]I'm incredibly... I'm incredibly optimistic about this.
[381:32.17]I've got it.
[381:33.33]Cynical.
[381:35.85]I'm not cynical.
[381:40.25]Cynical ENFP.
[381:45.80]Alright, just don't move.
[381:47.54]In fact, if anybody comes in here, they get in the axe anyways.
[381:50.26]Maybe they won't.
[381:51.12]I might get spawned on like three times.
[381:53.60]I'm just shooting the barrel.
[381:57.76]So while we sit here at night, what's the game plan for tomorrow?
[382:01.81]Game plan for tomorrow is wires to upgrade... I need to get oxygen tanks.
[382:15.06]I'm going to say maybe head out this way.
[382:17.82]Take a look over there.
[382:32.34]Alright, here we go.
[382:34.33]This is where they come out.
[382:37.89]Finish looting the rocket.
[382:40.57]Yeah, but... Maybe I don't... Maybe I don't... Maybe I don't need it.
[382:48.29]What was in it that I needed?
[382:49.19]I've got a hunting rifle.
[382:51.36]That thing is sick.
[382:55.52]Into the stream voice.
[382:56.44]No, I'm playing this until I'm done.
[382:57.62]Until I'm done.
[383:00.87]No, not into the stream.
[383:01.92]What are you talking about?
[383:12.30]I've just got some eye goopies.
[383:15.40]Or, you know, sometimes you just sit here and you get a blink a few times.
[383:20.42]Alright, this is where it starts.
[383:22.05]I gotta get ready.
[383:26.16]I have not heard anything yet.
[383:27.30]I think I've got some good light drainage over here, so that's probably why.
[383:31.12]Eye fatigue.
[383:45.17]Are we going to go a full night without anybody showing up to our front door?
[383:48.95]This would be phenomenal.
[383:50.33]This would be great.
[383:53.77]I'd be really happy about this.
[384:00.66]Don't spend one single round swinging an axe once?
[384:07.77]In the swamp, late game?
[384:09.31]That would be fantastic.
[384:11.38]Let me get the random dumb roll the one time.
[384:14.76]In the nearly 20 hours I've played this game.
[384:37.44]4am.
[385:16.19]It's not gonna happen.
[385:20.57]It's 6 AM.
[386:02.96]Hey, come on over here!
[386:03.90]I'm in here!
[386:04.44]Try to come find me!
[386:07.75]Nothing.
[386:08.03]We win.
[386:08.27]$250.
[386:08.29]Very cool.
[386:10.95]Oxygen tanks.
[386:32.28]Always buy scrap.
[386:33.94]Always buy... eggs.
[386:37.58]Always buy magazine.
[386:38.62]Always buy bullet.
[386:39.68]Always buy pill.
[386:44.61]But, wires too.
[386:49.11]Shit.
[386:51.11]I fucked up a little bit here.
[386:54.37]I may have fucked up a little bit here.
[387:05.41]What's shiny down here?
[387:14.17]There are some footprints on the floor.
[387:15.67]The door handle is covered with slime.
[387:37.53]Excuse me, excuse me!
[387:45.27]Dead musician.
[387:48.07]Holy shit, he's got a huge bag!
[387:54.66]He's got a giant bag, this is awesome!
[387:57.62]Oh my god, I'm gonna put so much stuff in here.
[388:04.06]Can I drag him up here?
[388:08.74]This is perfect.
[388:15.68]Whoa, was I not supposed to kill that person?
[388:17.18]What?
[388:21.54]Well, this is still very useful to me.
[388:30.07]Oh, well.
[388:33.39]There's a lot of stuff.
[388:34.49]I can't wait to spread up my stuff.
[388:36.31]Okay.
[388:37.49]I need three...
[388:40.47]Oh, thanks for the stone too.
[388:49.41]Shiny stone.
[388:50.79]What's wrong with my brain?
[389:04.48]Okay, what else do I want to sell?
[389:05.82]I'm gonna make... I'm gonna make the single shot shotgun.
[389:10.73]Are you ready?
[389:15.23]Three.
[389:16.69]Two.
[389:18.40]One.
[389:19.02]No.
[389:20.26]I was waiting for someone to say something.
[389:24.20]Wait.
[389:26.12]I was waiting for someone to tell me not to do this.
[389:30.04]Okay.
[389:32.58]Good to know.
[389:33.00]Alright, I'm gonna sell this and I'm gonna get some wires.
[389:41.11]What do you need for the better shotgun?
[389:43.13]I need to upgrade this stupid workbench first.
[389:46.37]Give me the wires.
[389:47.69]They shake their head no.
[389:48.83]We'll take a shiny stone instead.
[389:51.05]I need wires.
[389:51.67]I need one wire.
[389:56.09]And I can upgrade the workbench probably for the last time.
[390:00.45]One more wire.
[390:01.15]I don't have one.
[390:04.49]That sucks.
[390:05.85]Big time.
[390:08.67]Store that clip.
[390:13.19]Three shots in the hunting rifle?
[390:17.03]A bunch of wires at the rocket.
[390:20.45]Rocket ship time.
[390:23.18]Yeah, let's go loot everything at the rocket ship.
[390:26.82]Store everything.
[390:27.48]I gotta repair the shovel though, don't I?
[390:30.52]Yes, I do.
[390:33.49]Okay.
[390:35.41]Take that with me.
[390:36.11]I got my... This is overkill for heals.
[390:40.13]Don't need the nails.
[390:40.95]Don't need the rags.
[390:41.75]Don't need those pills.
[390:43.91]I need... I don't even need the second clip.
[390:47.37]In fact, I don't even need... I don't need the batteries either.
[390:54.20]Medium caliber bullets.
[390:55.16]I want as much space as I can.
[390:56.30]Let's go.
[390:57.88]We're going right back to the junkyard.
[391:01.20]I'm going to try to just loot a bunch of shit.
[391:08.58]Let's do it.
[391:11.82]I remember being actually mad at Jerma for putting Sun Chips low.
[391:14.76]Yeah, but we both don't have to like the same stuff.
[391:20.36]That's alright.
[391:22.16]That means we're different.
[391:26.14]You know, if you love Sun Chips... But, I mean, we can still, you know, we can still be friends.
[391:34.06]I don't have any lockpicks.
[391:48.89]I didn't bring any.
[391:58.19]Wasting time.
[391:59.56]Shut up!
[392:11.08]Where are my lockpicks, dude?
[392:13.40]Come on.
[392:20.50]Jerma, who would win in a fight?
[392:21.62]You or me?
[392:22.40]Every time.
[392:23.18]I don't care who it is.
[392:23.82]Alright, let's go.
[392:39.27]Open this chest.
[392:40.93]I want the goodies inside.
[392:42.49]That's a lot of stuff.
[392:51.33]A lot of stuff that I shouldn't be taking right now.
[392:54.70]Just take the drugs.
[392:59.80]Right now.
[393:01.26]Okay.
[393:01.82]Just keep moving.
[393:02.80]Almost to the junkyard.
[393:04.57]Sorry.
[393:16.07]Junkyard.
[393:32.60]Why is that the loudest thing in the whole game?
[393:37.12]That is... That's louder than everything else in the whole game.
[393:48.33]Junkyard!
[393:51.53]And I got my shovel.
[394:01.57]The doctor turns his mud-covered head towards the sun and freezes.
[394:05.43]Then he spreads his arms along his sides.
[394:08.60]Warm.
[394:09.54]A chunk of mud falls down on his exposed tongue.
[394:13.38]He chews it slowly and swallows it with satisfaction.
[394:25.99]I'll take the embryo.
[394:30.40]Let's might as well try to level up before it's over.
[394:37.22]The doctor puts the muddy hand into his mouth, grimaces and pulls out a yellow tooth.
[394:42.66]He puts it into his pocket of his torn trousers.
[394:44.96]The tooth falls through a hole.
[394:46.42]He does not notice this.
[394:48.26]The doctor begins staring at a nearby tree trunk, paying no attention to the blood flowing between his lips.
[394:54.81]The doctor glances at me.
[394:55.79]He tilts his head sideways, lost in thought.
[394:59.24]After a moment, he extends his hand towards me, as if wanting to grab me by the throat, but stops.
[395:04.68]He freezes.
[395:06.60]Slowly, he bends down and grabs a thick branch from the ground.
[395:09.30]He starts biting the bark off of it.
[395:12.27]He swallows the bark with an effort, but also great satisfaction.
[395:15.47]He places the stick among the other sticking out from the mud-covered head.
[395:19.21]Out from his mud-covered head.
[395:23.90]If the doctor approaches me, I can feel him embracing me.
[395:26.34]Why am I letting him do this?
[395:28.40]I hear his hoarse breath and smell his odor.
[395:30.08]I hear his whisper.
[395:32.15]Soon.
[395:34.49]Soon.
[395:36.27]Very soon.
[395:39.95]Not long from now.
[395:45.43]Fucking alien!
[395:49.42]Ooh.
[395:50.16]Wait.
[395:54.49]Back to the rocket ship.
[396:04.92]I have things to dig.
[396:05.94]This one says C on it.
[396:07.48]What does C have?
[396:10.36]Gun parts.
[396:20.82]Tubular magazine.
[396:23.07]Sparts.
[396:27.51]I can sell the watch.
[396:28.19]And here we go again.
[396:31.67]Life sucks in this game, because you have to pick up every item.
[396:45.59]There are the wires, son!
[396:47.83]You found him, son!
[396:49.01]Good work!
[397:12.32]I can't... I'm full again.
[397:21.52]Drop the rags.
[397:22.36]I mean, I could make a healing thing.
[397:29.09]What am I picking up instead?
[397:33.68]Alright, I want to dig.
[397:39.40]Where is the fancy clothes?
[397:43.03]Some fine quality clothing is H. Down here?
[397:46.71]Wait, wait, wait.
[397:51.43]Where's C in relative to that?
[397:53.11]C is there, so I have to go across here.
[397:59.91]There's H. Fine quality clothes.
[398:02.35]Let's get them.
[398:14.76]Shit.
[398:15.10]It's just expensive fabric.
[398:22.23]Ugh.
[398:23.05]I can't.
[398:24.33]It's... I have to leave.
[398:26.37]Oh, and I have a full inventory.
[398:30.95]Money, I know, I know, but I have... So I just get rid of this meat?
[398:35.24]Do I even care?
[398:36.00]Alright.
[398:40.34]I feel bad for you, but I... I'm keeping the embryo.
[398:47.01]What about the mushrooms?
[398:51.09]The shell?
[398:51.67]I need two of these for armor, but...
[398:58.28]Shotgun shell.
[398:59.78]The rags.
[399:01.24]The wood.
[399:04.30]The logs.
[399:06.23]Alright, I got it.
[399:07.59]Good.
[399:09.31]Back home.
[399:10.73]Because I have no more space.
[399:13.89]The title is wrong.
[399:14.79]What do you mean?
[399:16.93]Craft something.
[399:20.34]I need these wires.
[399:21.60]No, I don't have enough room.
[399:24.20]Kill the doctor.
[399:25.04]Not yet.
[399:26.74]He doesn't deserve it right now.
[399:28.64]We are going to run.
[399:30.42]Fast.
[399:35.43]It should be Darkwood 2.
[399:38.01]This is Darkwood 3.
[399:40.79]Wait, you guys have not been keeping up with the stream?
[399:43.63]Darkwood?
[399:44.33]This is Darkwood stream number 3.
[399:46.01]I haven't been keeping up.
[399:56.70]I didn't skip two.
[399:57.68]I did two.
[400:04.15]The first copy is two.
[400:05.67]Yeah.
[400:06.89]Darkwood in brackets one, copy of Darkwood is the second shortcut.
[400:15.99]This is the third stream, so it's three in the bracket.
[400:22.15]Alright, I need to do this now.
[400:24.77]I have it.
[400:25.37]Let's upgrade the workbench.
[400:26.81]Finally.
[400:28.07]It's taken like 12 hours to get this far.
[400:30.67]Do it.
[400:34.35]Hunting rifle.
[400:35.51]Double barreled shotgun.
[400:37.48]I need a second barrel.
[400:41.46]Back to the junkyard.
[400:42.44]Let's go.
[400:42.74]Quickly.
[400:43.38]Quickly.
[400:55.41]Cook this stuff.
[400:58.69]Back to the junkyard.
[400:59.47]Cook these.
[400:59.93]Back to the junkyard.
[401:01.03]I need the gun parts.
[401:02.09]I got my shovel.
[401:02.73]I got my heals.
[401:04.23]Let's go.
[401:04.57]Hurry up.
[401:07.83]What's the next workshop?
[401:08.85]Upgrade.
[401:09.31]Good question.
[401:10.93]Another one of those pliers that I don't have.
[401:13.17]Double-barreled shotgun.
[401:14.09]Okay.
[401:16.54]Let me cook this shit.
[401:18.86]And then... Okay.
[401:24.18]Put the watch away.
[401:26.80]I need that.
[401:27.68]I will never not be able to use that.
[401:29.20]Alright.
[401:31.56]Almost halfway there.
[401:33.76]Back to the junkyard quickly.
[401:43.58]I need another barrel.
[401:47.86]Is uptime broken?
[401:48.68]Twitch I think is broken.
[401:51.12]There's a lot of issues on Twitch right now.
[401:53.72]I don't know.
[401:54.28]I know that they have the view issue, so maybe the uptime issue is there as well.
[402:00.60]I don't know.
[402:11.54]What's this?
[402:12.56]No, it's a guy's head.
[402:16.73]Don't pick up anything.
[402:17.41]Just focus on the task.
[402:24.54]This is part of the task, I need scrap.
[402:28.56]Get to junkyard.
[402:34.44]Free money.
[402:40.45]Okay, gun parts is what one of them said.
[402:46.15]Where's that damn entrance?
[402:55.55]Okay.
[402:57.79]So, what did I leave on the ground here?
[403:01.98]Doctor's gum.
[403:04.28]I can take this now.
[403:05.12]I can take them both.
[403:06.44]For now.
[403:10.33]Gun parts at C. Barrel.
[403:27.73]What are you, dumb?
[403:29.95]That's a gun part to you?
[403:42.24]What about E?
[403:44.28]Planks, nails, don't want useful scrap metal, gun parts, ropes, tape, antlers, some tools.
[403:50.17]What about E?
[403:53.43]This is G.
[403:58.97]That's a G. That's not a C. That's a G. That's G. I thought... We're C then.
[404:05.81]All the way over here.
[404:06.47]Oh, that's annoying.
[404:09.94]Hope I have enough... Stability in my... Which one of these is C?
[404:24.55]A. C is right here.
[404:25.71]Give me the mushroom.
[404:30.71]Here we go.
[404:31.53]C. Damn it.
[404:42.46]I'll be able to get it tomorrow, though, because he sells it, doesn't he?
[404:44.33]Alright.
[404:49.05]We're good.
[404:54.28]Can I take anything else from the crash?
[404:55.84]I can take the watch.
[404:57.62]That's expensive.
[404:58.44]The useless.
[405:02.24]I can take this.
[405:03.04]Expensive.
[405:03.78]Some more gas.
[405:06.69]Good day.
[405:10.01]It was a good day.
[405:17.57]Back to bed.
[405:21.76]As we used to say.
[405:38.84]Just here to tell you that your mixer move is almost set up.
[405:40.86]Can't wait to hear from you.
[405:43.94]I ain't ever moving platforms ever again.
[405:48.11]So, uh... That ain't gonna happen.
[406:04.52]I did the... I did YouTube for like six years.
[406:10.48]Moved to Twitch.
[406:11.16]It's been about four years.
[406:12.47]Four and a half on Twitch.
[406:13.67]Just about four.
[406:17.49]This is where I stay.
[406:22.23]I ain't digging up foundations and moving to another streaming platform.
[406:29.10]These are both boards.
[406:29.90]Okay.
[406:39.50]Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[406:41.22]How we doing on gas?
[406:43.24]We're doing alright.
[406:45.30]Cook.
[407:00.53]I have so much stuff to sell.
[407:01.61]I'm gonna have, like, two grand from this trader.
[407:12.73]Can I upgrade this axe again?
[407:16.67]Oh man, oh man.
[407:21.65]Yeah.
[407:26.10]Inflict more damage.
[407:29.36]More durability or more damage.
[407:34.38]That means this pretty much means I'll... Damage.
[407:43.22]Alright, I need four rocks.
[407:45.86]Tell me to make sure to remind me to get those tomorrow.
[407:49.12]Shiny stone, wood.
[407:50.88]Let's get what I need to board.
[407:52.38]I'm all done.
[407:53.10]I'm all done.
[407:53.92]I did that already.
[407:56.02]I've got my trap set up.
[407:57.72]I just want to make sure I'm good to go.
[407:59.28]I've got heals.
[408:02.26]Do you see what I'm talking about?
[408:03.14]Everyone thought I was crazy.
[408:06.06]The shovel away.
[408:12.05]Magazine is fine.
[408:14.39]Gonna make the armor.
[408:21.21]Okay.
[408:22.93]Cool.
[408:25.45]Time to shack up for the night.
[408:36.05]That's wrong.
[408:42.38]It's also wrong.
[408:58.22]Kill the lights in here.
[409:00.08]Watch out.
[409:01.36]It's back there.
[409:02.02]Okay.
[409:24.33]Maybe a little bit more over this way.
[409:44.83]Come on in!
[409:56.13]Oh man, sometimes you gotta stretch.
[409:59.97]Gotta stretch it out.
[410:05.60]Can you please write how you like your eggs cooked in descending order, best to worst?
[410:09.02]Sure.
[410:11.79]S tier, S plus, no match, completely unmatched, is a hard-boiled egg that has a jammy yolk.
[410:20.25]but not too soft.
[410:22.29]Jammy, but not too soft, and it has to be hot.
[410:26.07]I'm talking right out of the boiling water.
[410:29.64]You peel it, a little bit of salt, hot.
[410:33.14]Yep.
[410:34.28]S plus tier.
[410:37.88]Over hard, no.
[410:40.06]Over medium, but like almost, almost too hard.
[410:43.22]Very close, incredibly close.
[410:45.84]So from there, fresh hard-boiled egg, right there, bang, S. Somewhere at A is a over-medium egg, like fried on a flat top.
[410:59.52]I don't like over-easy.
[411:00.52]Over-easy is down somewhere at F. I do not like a runny egg.
[411:04.20]It gets everywhere.
[411:07.28]To me, it is not cooked.
[411:09.26]It's not fully cooked all the way.
[411:11.76]But let me, hold on.
[411:13.84]I know people are probably gonna get really upset about this, but let me try to reiterate what I'm trying to say here.
[411:17.14]So there is over easy, which is good, where the egg is cooked.
[411:22.96]But there are people that do over easy where they only cook the part of the egg that is the white part.
[411:31.08]That's, I don't like that.
[411:32.90]And it's literally raw in the middle.
[411:35.58]A raw egg in the middle is not appetizing to me at all.
[411:40.16]An over medium egg with a jammy middle.
[411:42.44]Bingo.
[411:43.58]That's A. Also on the A tier, I would put a poached egg.
[411:50.07]Poached egg sits right up next to over medium.
[411:52.91]In fact, poached egg might also be up at S. In fact, I'm going to have to say it is.
[411:58.27]Yes.
[412:01.88]Exposed by Kim.
[412:03.46]What did Kim say?
[412:09.86]What do you mean, exposed?
[412:11.76]What'd she say?
[412:14.26]Poached his ass, yes.
[412:16.92]Poached egg on toast.
[412:18.71]He likes his egg well done.
[412:19.81]No, I like it like 10 to 12 minutes and hard-boiled.
[412:26.33]Where's scrambled?
[412:28.61]Scrambled is like B, I think.
[412:35.87]Medium raw.
[412:36.69]No, I like it like over medium to over hard.
[412:41.84]She said you like your eggs completely raw.
[412:43.66]That's absolute horseshit.
[412:50.10]No, you guys are feeding them.
[412:51.75]That's a joke.
[412:55.73]Blue egg?
[412:56.69]Rare eggs.
[413:00.57]There's no such thing as a rare egg.
[413:02.86]You either cook an egg or you don't.
[413:10.03]Alright, you got me all twisted here.
[413:12.66]Hard-boiled egg is at top, fresh out of the boiling water.
[413:16.88]Crack open, peel, rinse, salt, maybe a little bit of pepper, and then blah.
[413:23.08]Over medium.
[413:24.19]Best egg that's on a flat top, cooked over medium.
[413:27.81]Sunny side up.
[413:31.03]Looks cool in pictures.
[413:33.79]No, thank you.
[413:36.46]Get that cartoon shit out of here.
[413:40.61]It looks cool in pictures.
[413:43.27]Scrambled eggs are somewhere around the B tier.
[413:46.39]I love them.
[413:46.87]I'll leave them.
[413:47.33]I love eggs, by the way.
[413:48.95]By the way, an F in my egg tier list is pretty high because I love eggs.
[413:57.88]What's this?
[413:58.20]Click on the link.
[414:05.72]I make you ovaries eggs all the time.
[414:08.07]No, but you, but you don't, no, you, you do it.
[414:10.49]Hold on.
[414:11.73]You do it in a way that's not, the egg is not like raw in the middle.
[414:18.58]It's runny, but it's, it's malleable.
[414:21.62]It's jammy.
[414:22.54]It drains out.
[414:23.66]It's not just like water.
[414:25.84]People do the water shit where you, it's water in there.
[414:31.66]Over medium, you know, you know that over medium is my favorite.
[414:35.73]You know that over... Okay, Kim, is over medium my favorite?
[414:46.52]Where is it?
[414:46.88]Where is it?
[414:47.22]Where is it?
[414:47.56]Where is it?
[414:48.04]Where is it?
[414:48.58]Where is it?
[414:54.54]Oh, shit.
[414:55.24]It's moving around everything.
[414:59.00]Over medium is my favorite egg, so you know that.
[415:02.00]over hard over medium my two favorites hard boiled eggs are fantastic also something that's very important to know is I'm I'm like a I'm like an undercooked weirdo I don't like undercooked food I don't order hamburgers unless they're medium or above I don't like eating undercooked food I don't like eating raw food unless it's sushi which exception
[415:31.86]What just happened?
[415:37.12]Somebody just got eaten outside.
[415:38.64]Alright, here they come.
[415:42.35]Here we go.
[415:42.73]This is it.
[415:43.55]This is it.
[415:43.91]This is it.
[415:44.21]This is it.
[416:04.47]Medium rare is correct.
[416:06.48]Cook.
[416:08.76]No, I don't like... I don't like a bloody meaty steak.
[416:11.66]I don't like a... I don't like... Like, red blood in my Amber... Come here.
[416:24.81]Get out of here, dickhead!
[416:30.92]He's dead?
[416:44.50]We're good.
[416:46.46]I don't like rare stuff.
[416:47.60]I don't.
[416:48.16]It just tastes gross to me.
[416:49.80]I'm sorry.
[416:50.32]People think... Well, you gotta eat that steak rare.
[416:54.70]Eat a medium rare steak.
[416:56.16]It's gotta be rare.
[416:58.31]Excuse me, sir.
[416:58.93]I'll throw up.
[416:59.55]I'll puke if you hand that to me.
[417:06.75]If you told me to eat a rare steak, I would throw up.
[417:12.83]Do you cook your fruits before you eat them?
[417:16.65]Rare steak has a shitload.
[417:20.97]Raw meat has an insane amount of food-borne illnesses.
[417:25.67]E. coli, tapeworms, worms, bacteria, viruses.
[417:31.94]It's not like eating a strawberry.
[417:37.54]Rare is cooked enough to kill it.
[417:39.00]I don't buy it.
[417:39.74]Sorry.
[417:43.98]Medium rare.
[417:45.42]Okay.
[417:47.44]We're good.
[417:48.88]I wouldn't be upset about that.
[417:50.44]I'd be like, okay, this is fine.
[417:51.48]Medium rare, that's fine.
[417:53.46]Rare though.
[417:55.48]I've seen Kim eat a rare piece of steak.
[418:00.17]And man, oh man, sometimes that shit looks like purple in the middle.
[418:14.13]Now, I want mine to be cooked all the way- all the way through.
[418:17.85]That's called flavor.
[418:18.99]I don't like the taste of fucking blood!
[418:21.44]I don't like the taste of, like, wet, watery blood!
[418:24.08]I don't wa- I don't like blood!
[418:27.72]When you eat, like, the steak- ooh, cool, look at those juices!
[418:30.62]That's not juice!
[418:31.42]The steak doesn't have- it's blood!
[418:32.96]You're eating blood and membrane fluid!
[418:40.76]The red shit in there, that's blood and membrane fluid!
[418:50.75]It's fucking, it's like all kinds of weird gross fucking fluids.
[418:56.62]Oh, look at this chat fucking flying right now.
[419:01.14]Guys, I ate a rare steak like fucking an hour ago when I went on BRB.
[419:05.38]I ate it with my bare hands.
[419:06.50]I bit it with my teeth and I was like, I'm a fucking animal.
[419:16.84]Now, we can move on, though.
[419:17.80]I'll tell you.
[419:18.14]I'll just be very, very clear.
[419:19.24]I'll make it very clear.
[419:21.46]Rare red meat is gross.
[419:28.95]I'm not a... This is just my opinion.
[419:33.39]My opinion.
[419:35.25]I'm not a vegetarian.
[419:36.75]I'm not, like, a vegan.
[419:38.24]I just think that rare... I eat red meat all the time, although I'm trying to cut back on it because of low FODMAP and garlic and all that.
[419:44.20]You know that you understand.
[419:47.69]rare red meat fucking gross meal just like how a eating of an undercooked egg or that's why I really need to explain my food preferences wrong onion wrong opinion he's a Las Vegas he's a las vegan las las vegan
[420:21.18]Wrong opinion.
[420:25.58]I love onions, but I can't have them right now.
[420:30.60]Didn't I just... Okay.
[420:31.98]I don't know where we got on this from.
[420:35.95]But... Somebody said, you don't like sun chips.
[420:41.15]And I'm like, yeah, that's alright.
[420:42.85]Because we both have different tastes.
[420:47.56]And everybody agreed with that.
[420:49.58]All of you guys agreed at the same time.
[420:51.96]Oh, yeah, you know, if you don't like sun chips, whatever, you like Pringles.
[420:54.64]I like the pizza Pringles.
[420:55.64]They're my favorite.
[420:56.41]Sour cream and onion fucking Lay's banana chips.
[420:58.53]Those are my favorite.
[420:59.43]Everybody has their own opinion.
[421:01.03]The second you tell somebody that you don't like raw steak... I thought I knew this guy.
[421:09.77]But I wouldn't even care if he was buried six feet under.
[421:18.25]What's the difference?
[421:26.30]Chat war.
[421:30.08]Half you fuckers don't eat steak?
[421:37.29]Meat snob.
[421:44.64]Your opinion is wrong.
[421:46.60]There are no such thing as wrong opinions on food.
[421:52.38]Alright, let me ask you this.
[421:54.10]What do you guys think?
[421:55.62]Wait, everybody quiet.
[421:56.74]This is important.
[421:57.49]This is super important.
[421:58.73]I gotta ask you a question.
[422:00.37]Everybody quiet for a second.
[422:01.81]This is very important shit.
[422:04.51]Have you ever heard... Have you ever heard of worm cheese?
[422:12.10]It's the most expensive, finest cheese in the world.
[422:15.84]It is the most expensive shit, it's the most expensive cheese on Earth.
[422:19.30]It's incredibly delicious, but it's covered in worms.
[422:23.19]There are fucking maggots and mealworms in it.
[422:27.03]Is that, should, would you eat it?
[422:32.49]Eat it.
[422:40.19]That food is illegal.
[422:49.21]Wait, is it actually banned?
[422:51.17]Is it actually illegal food?
[422:54.48]That food is illegal.
[423:00.50]It's banned.
[423:06.13]My point is...
[423:07.80]If you think that's... I think that's gross.
[423:10.26]Right?
[423:10.86]That's gross.
[423:12.24]But if somebody eats that and they like it... If somebody eats worms... Alright, forget about the cheese part.
[423:16.51]If somebody just eats worms, do you think that that's gross?
[423:21.93]Your point just got decimated.
[423:23.89]Not entirely.
[423:26.05]Is eating mealworms disgusting?
[423:28.51]What do you say?
[423:28.95]Yes or no?
[423:30.01]If anybody in here says yes, don't tell me I don't like raw steak.
[423:34.90]Rare steak.
[423:37.33]Absolutely yes.
[423:38.11]Okay, well, in about a hundred years, that's gonna be your rare steak.
[423:43.75]Eat up.
[423:45.94]Because this shit ain't gonna be able to last that long.
[423:49.36]So in like 200 years, enjoy your mealworm patties and your cricket sundaes.
[424:10.23]No one here will be alive.
[424:20.39]But if you were... Oh, fuck.
[424:27.50]Alright, I'm going back to...
[424:37.70]If you... Alright.
[424:38.36]Let me just... This whole thing came from, I don't like rare steak.
[424:53.76]Are you gonna punch me in the face the next time you see me in real life?
[425:06.86]Rare fucking steak.
[425:14.97]I would never hurt you.
[425:17.09]Thank you.
[425:20.35]11 hour stream, let's go.
[425:21.31]I'm still going, we're good.
[425:24.65]I might take a water break here in a few minutes.
[425:31.14]I'm gonna punch you in your stomach because it doesn't like good food.
[425:34.80]I think that's what somebody just said.
[425:44.32]I'm gonna go get some water I'll be right back alright dude nobody I'm gonna get some medium rare water I'll be right back
[426:15.05]Thank you.

[428:50.25]He's fired up.
[428:58.92]You guys have... You guys have... I like having fun conversations with you guys.
[429:05.76]It's fun.
[429:13.70]Did you boil your water?
[429:15.62]Actually, that's a way to clean it.
[429:17.35]It's a way to kill germs in water.
[429:18.91]You boil it.
[429:20.67]What is this democracy?
[429:21.61]What are you looking at?
[429:22.49]Why am I looking at this?
[429:25.33]Is steak overrated?
[429:30.29]Let me do my vote for this.
[429:31.77]There's only 13 votes on this poll.
[429:34.99]Why is this?
[429:36.29]Hey, you got to take a look at this.
[429:37.55]What everybody thought.
[429:38.47]It's like 12 people voted on this.
[429:50.70]Wrong poll.
[429:54.26]Would you eat a rare steak?
[430:00.96]My opinion is not that unpopular.
[430:06.89]That's a 45%.
[430:07.29]Just saying.
[430:20.62]Well done is the only way to go.
[430:21.76]Now, I... What's that?
[430:24.57]Hold on.
[430:24.97]Let me... Hold on.
[430:25.69]Wait, wait, wait.
[430:28.93]Oh, do you like your steak well done?
[430:31.07]I wouldn't order that, but... However you like it.
[430:34.19]Do you like it like that?
[430:41.02]Enjoy it.
[430:42.76]I like my steak the way that I like my steak and you, yours.
[430:47.70]Right.
[430:49.34]Cool, okay.
[430:52.59]We can move on from this conversation.
[430:55.48]I'm not gonna slam both my hands on the dinner table with the fork and knife in my hand and be like, Rare steak!
[430:59.88]Rare steak!
[431:00.78]Rare steak!

[431:57.39]Where's the big backpack dude?
[432:00.15]Where's the backpack person?

[432:13.12]I know they're dead.
[432:14.02]I know.
[432:14.26]I killed them.
[432:14.88]I know.
[432:16.19]Why are they not just lying on the ground still?
[432:20.07]I gotta... I think I'm just gonna go... Wait, it's a new day.
[432:25.88]Get all the new day supplies.
[432:28.56]And long barrel.
[432:33.32]Long barrel.
[432:34.76]I don't have enough.
[432:39.38]I could give you this nice watch.
[432:45.99]I actually have a ton of things to sell.
[432:50.01]Oh, yeah.
[432:50.69]Here we go.
[432:54.97]Keep that watch.

[433:14.75]Are you serious?
[433:15.37]Really?
[433:17.69]Really?
[433:20.58]Well, alright.
[433:21.57]Anyways, in the meantime, I'll sell this.
[433:24.15]And I will make... I need to get stones for the axe.
[433:36.40]And buy battery.
[433:45.63]And the egg, too.
[433:46.43]Yeah, let's go cook.
[433:50.71]The watch?
[433:51.11]I have a watch.
[433:51.58]I got a watch still.
[433:56.84]See?
[434:00.68]Let's fill up the tanks.
[434:04.52]And then... I need four stones.
[434:25.64]Twelve.
[434:26.54]Sixteen hundred almost there.
[434:30.44]When's Jerma 986 gonna come out?
[434:34.10]Probably never.
[434:34.58]Get the generator.
[434:55.60]Yeah, you gotta get Jerma 986.
[434:56.88]Jerma985 is starting to get a little weird for me.
[435:02.24]Okay, that's good.
[435:04.54]Nothing else to cook.
[435:05.64]No.
[435:05.88]I need stones.
[435:09.66]And then we need to find an oxygen tank.
[435:13.75]Wherever the hell that is.
[435:14.61]Okay.
[435:23.72]Two clips.
[435:24.50]That should be good.
[435:26.58]Lockpick.
[435:29.40]Battery.
[435:30.16]Okay, I got heals.
[435:32.96]Do I need to take anything else?
[435:34.10]I don't think so.
[435:41.16]Yeah, I got... Yeah, I'm good.
[435:45.41]I'll take these so I can run.
[435:49.47]Need rocks.
[435:50.61]And...
[435:54.16]I'm just going to head out this way.
[435:55.78]I don't have any more info.
[436:00.20]Should I go back to the village?
[436:02.46]And maybe talk to the old man?
[436:03.60]I think I'm just going to go take a look.
[436:18.13]I can build a fence.
[436:18.87]I'm just going to explore over here.
[436:27.15]I'm just gonna take a look that way.
[436:29.37]Look for stones.
[436:34.95]You know, just gonna do a little bit of drugs.
[436:39.40]And move on.
[436:42.80]Let's head west.
[437:00.92]Hey.
[437:03.94]Stop.
[437:05.87]One hit kill now.
[437:07.19]Perfect.
[437:07.73]Beautiful.
[437:08.47]Stones.
[437:10.27]Fallen tree.
[437:11.07]A fallen tree.
[437:11.57]It's bark looks chewed up.
[437:37.02]What the fuck's going on in here?
[437:51.87]What was that?
[438:07.84]I can't see.
[438:08.38]Oh, it's just one of these, like, weird trees.
[438:12.78]Okay.
[438:13.75]Oh.
[438:14.89]Another stone.
[438:19.09]Where's the dog?
[438:22.61]I'm just trying to explore.
[438:24.91]Leave me alone.
[438:45.32]Those things... those things... suck.
[438:49.40]Those guys... suck.
[439:03.97]They do suck.
[439:05.63]They do.
[439:08.59]They do!
[439:11.29]Stones... take it for now.
[439:18.20]I still don't get this stuff.
[439:19.50]Does this mean something?
[439:23.01]It means death.
[439:25.19]Well, I don't want that.
[439:29.03]Okay, structure.
[439:48.02]A little shack.
[439:50.08]Hello!
[439:51.34]Where have you been?
[439:52.76]This guy's fucked up.
[439:58.07]Okay.
[440:11.28]Hey!
[440:15.02]Hey!
[440:20.60]Oh, you idiot.
[440:21.32]I couldn't see the line of sight.
[440:23.08]Close the damn door.
[440:32.65]I need gunner optics.
[440:50.66]Let me craft some shit out of here.
[440:52.08]I don't have any room.
[440:56.93]I don't really care about the stone.
[441:07.14]Not really.
[441:21.53]Mushroom Glade.
[441:22.51]Okay.
[441:32.31]Holy shit.
[441:41.56]Oh fuck, this guy sucks ass.
[441:44.12]This guy's horrendous.
[441:48.33]Okay, I'm trying to heal.
[441:49.66]That was just ridiculous.
[442:04.52]Just put yellow construction paper on the monitor.
[442:13.81]What did I have in my inventory?
[442:18.47]Let's put this shit away.
[442:24.87]Alright.
[442:26.53]New... I wish I could just... It's the wood.
[442:31.55]Collecting the wood and the nails is just such a pain in the ass.
[442:36.71]Like, I don't want to pick up logs anymore.
[442:40.36]We're 20 hours into the game.
[442:42.46]I still gotta pick up stumps?
[442:45.28]It just makes me upset.
[442:53.50]Heck.
[442:57.36]Well, back out to the wilderness to go get all my stuff again.
[443:00.68]And I'm shooting that thing with a hunting rifle.
[443:08.16]I have heals.
[443:08.78]I should probably repair the axe.
[443:17.63]Yeah.
[443:19.95]Just do it.
[443:24.11]Where is, uh... Oh, the stones are on me.
[443:26.95]Alright.
[443:36.48]Let's go.
[443:36.90]What else am I going to do?
[443:40.56]What am I going to do?
[443:41.10]Cry about it?
[443:41.70]I don't have any batteries either.
[443:49.00]They were on me.
[443:50.56]Bring out the rifle.
[443:52.00]That thing is dead.
[443:59.44]It's so far away from here too.
[444:00.90]This is my run, gimme it.
[444:06.36]That shit's like across the globe.
[444:07.92]Don't step in poison either.
[444:29.85]Remember this shit?
[444:32.53]Takes me forever to aim, too.
[444:33.83]This accuracy.
[444:34.63]Fuck you.
[444:40.67]I think that was the guy.
[444:54.84]That was the guy.
[444:56.44]No, it wasn't.
[445:03.70]It's further back this way.
[445:15.63]It was like right in the open too, wasn't it?
[445:18.25]Okay, it was down this way.
[445:20.87]Where is he?
[445:24.92]Cut its head off!
[445:25.48]Cut its head off!
[445:48.72]Keep going.
[445:55.14]We're in the mushroom forest.
[446:03.94]It was that one.
[446:05.20]How many are there?
[446:39.45]Die!
[446:44.14]Dude, there's so many more monsters that are so scary now.
[446:47.54]Good thing I have these weapons.
[446:51.14]I'm just trying to find...
[446:53.64]A house or a new shed or a shack.
[447:09.39]Okay.
[447:09.77]Here's a shed.
[447:11.58]I can't get in here.
[447:13.62]I need to burn it.
[447:14.20]I don't have anything to burn.
[447:18.54]Damn it.
[447:24.38]Damn it.
[447:33.36]Well, the radio tower is down here.
[447:34.62]Might as well take a look at it.
[447:57.26]Where's the radio tower?
[448:04.69]What the fuck is this?
[448:38.57]Okay.
[448:39.11]I've been so silent.
[448:39.97]I'm sorry.
[448:40.39]I just don't want to die.
[448:55.40]Is the stream live?
[448:56.68]Yeah, it's called... I'm trying to win.
[449:01.68]This is what a winner looks like.
[449:18.74]There's a tower.
[449:23.84]The fence has been torn to shreds.
[449:28.81]Alright, this is the radio tower.
[449:35.99]Can't really get this out of the way.
[449:49.91]They're sleeping, but any noise can wake them up.
[449:54.29]What?
[449:55.61]What are you talking- What do you mean?
[450:03.58]Don't make any no- I'm not- I'm trying not to make any noise.
[450:07.02]Just getting out of there.
[450:07.90]Washroom.
[450:20.97]Make noise.
[450:21.63]Make noise.
[450:22.25]Make... No.
[450:23.09]No.
[450:27.55]What's even down here?
[450:31.37]I think that... I think I have... There's a snail down here!
[450:43.07]It's the snail!
[450:43.71]What happened to the snail?
[450:57.00]He got eaten.
[450:59.74]That's not good.
[451:09.71]Oh, turn off the light.
[451:11.43]Um... What is that on the ground?
[451:29.51]Can I climb this?
[451:32.30]Is it a snail?
[451:33.27]Is it a slug?
[451:35.26]Look at the time.
[452:11.57]I'm trying to go home, I just don't want to step on any bird's heads!
[452:15.13]Uh-oh, I dinged it!
[452:18.24]It's alright.
[452:36.89]I've already got my runner.
[452:41.22]Oh, I'm dead.
[452:43.08]Find a nice place to die.
[452:44.24]No way.
[452:56.30]I ain't gonna make it through this one.
[452:59.10]I could scream.
[453:08.79]I'm not even close.
[453:11.47]I'm going to get my scream ready, and I'm going to have to keep running to straight.
[453:16.13]An intense sweet smell of mushrooms fills the air.
[453:21.11]Great.
[453:24.10]I hope you like it.
[453:28.58]I'm going to get lost in the mushroom forest, aren't I?
[453:40.31]Location found.
[453:41.25]Holes.
[453:45.26]Holes?
[453:45.66]What do you mean holes?
[453:58.60]Go in.
[453:59.56]I don't know where they are.
[454:00.36]I don't have time to know where they are.
[454:01.46]Where are these holes?
[454:12.77]Go home.
[454:16.99]I can only go so fast.
[454:18.47]I'm not making it.
[454:19.83]Great lake.
[454:20.53]At least I'm finding shit.
[454:22.26]I'm dead.
[454:33.36]I need to find a gra- I don't want to die here because this is be- this is- Everything has to be so dark in this game.
[454:39.76]Everything's gotta- everything has to be a fucking forest.
[454:43.04]Darkwood.
[454:43.66]I know the name's- yeah, the game is called Darkwood.
[454:47.37]What?
[454:55.77]Holy shit, that's a dragon!
[454:57.41]I don't want to die in here!
[455:00.79]This is a bad pla-
[455:05.64]What is on me?
[455:07.72]Get off me!
[455:18.97]Oh my god, this stamina is so annoying.
[455:22.57]I just wanna go, but I can't because you can only run for like four... I'm fucking dead.
[455:37.30]Old shit.
[455:38.27]Oh good.
[455:38.83]Coming across all kinds of cool stuff.
[456:33.33]There's two!
[456:34.09]Where's the house?
[456:59.77]Dude, I would pay a hundred bucks to increase that stamina bar by even 20%.
[457:07.82]Like, where's the stamina upgrades?
[457:09.72]And I can't have a stamina upgrade the whole game?
[457:11.52]I ran past.
[457:19.27]No, I didn't.
[457:20.09]I ran below it.
[457:28.40]And now I have to go out here to pick up these fucking tools.
[457:31.32]I think I got all these pieces of, like, dog carcass.
[457:44.13]Whatever the hell these are.
[458:07.14]I'm doing Chameleon.
[458:09.04]Do I have to actually... No, I don't have to pick another bad one, do I?
[458:11.50]Alright.
[458:14.08]I can be invisible.
[458:18.42]I'm at max level.
[458:25.61]So, all meat is now worthless.
[458:28.17]So, don't pick it up.
[458:28.91]I don't even need to go to the fridge anymore.
[458:37.71]So therefore, take everything out of here that has anything to do with food and throw it in the trash.
[458:48.08]Okay.
[458:56.15]I still need one of these.
[458:57.15]I don't even know where the fuck I'm supposed to go right now.
[459:07.78]Do I have any notes or anything?
[459:09.20]I hit the wall at the junkyard.
[459:18.94]I mean, there's mushroom... Who's in here?
[459:29.78]Talk to the old man.
[459:30.92]Okay.
[459:32.92]He's making a statement against me.
[459:38.98]It's called... It's not good anymore.
[459:40.44]It's rotten.
[459:41.17]Alright, come here.
[459:44.77]Can I even sell this?
[459:46.27]I guess I can still sell it.
[459:52.97]Well, there are my rocks, but I can't use them.
[459:58.89]You didn't actually get inside the tower.
[460:00.12]You hit the crow boss and realized you had no time.
[460:05.30]Whatever the guy was.
[460:06.04]That guy was fucked up.
[460:09.13]Uh, alright.
[460:10.17]Let me just do the things I typically do.
[460:11.65]Just buy this stuff.
[460:13.84]I already have that.
[460:14.62]Don't.
[460:14.86]I don't want the bullet.
[460:23.32]Wires?
[460:25.67]Yeah, I'll buy some.
[460:28.05]I'll get some drugs, too.
[460:29.47]Because I ate them all.
[460:32.51]Okay.
[460:35.05]He just stepped on his babies.
[460:37.85]I didn't mean to.
[460:47.20]I need to go back and get my stuff.
[460:54.10]I'm gonna go talk to the old man.
[461:03.47]I don't need the wires.
[461:04.79]Take a clip.
[461:06.48]Take two clips, even.
[461:07.66]Okay.
[461:11.64]Let's reload the guns.
[461:15.54]And I'm going to go see what the hell I need to do.
[461:17.04]Because I kind of just... I just walked in a straight line this way.
[461:24.47]And died.
[461:29.81]Can I burn the radio tower down instead?
[461:31.67]I'd rather do that.
[461:33.74]I want to save the fucking tree.
[461:39.84]That trek sucks.
[461:43.64]Well, it already is destroyed, so somebody already did it.
[461:45.70]Okay, well, that's fine.
[461:46.58]Alright, let me get my stuff.
[461:52.72]Hopefully not die.
[461:53.48]Who's right here?
[462:04.60]Is that me?
[462:05.22]Is that my body?
[462:06.64]Let's go get rid of it.
[462:21.77]Let's deposit all this crap.
[462:23.31]Keep the lockpicks.
[462:28.38]Uh, I gotta get rid of those, but I don't... what the hell am I supposed to do with them now?
[462:33.10]Uh, bottle.
[462:33.88]What else?
[462:34.70]Get rid of that.
[462:35.28]Uh, get rid of the rags.
[462:39.00]Get rid of the scrap.
[462:40.36]Okay.
[462:41.58]Let's go talk to Old Man.
[462:45.40]These holes are a shortcut to your base.
[462:51.73]What?
[462:55.43]Upgrade the axe.
[462:56.05]I have the stones.
[462:56.61]Right, right, right.
[463:00.83]I know, I know, I know.
[463:01.57]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[463:05.59]Uh, inflict more damage.
[463:06.81]There it is.
[463:09.17]Axe is now better.
[463:11.77]Let's hope it's good.
[463:15.93]Alright, let's talk to Old Man.
[463:20.98]I need some direction here.
[463:23.26]Because I feel pretty directionless at the moment.
[463:37.75]He's just mad at meat and eggs.
[463:44.03]Yeah, I'm just really pissed off about... Poultry... It just really gets me going.
[463:51.60]It makes me so aggravated.
[463:52.92]Where's the entrance here?
[463:56.84]It's like a weird spot, isn't it?
[464:03.31]Isn't it like a... It's like a weird entrance.
[464:18.10]Where do I get in here?
[464:19.08]Up here?
[464:19.48]Yeah, it's this way.
[464:28.01]Alright.
[464:28.75]Let's go talk to Grandpa.
[464:32.77]Grandpa, help me.
[464:33.59]Tell me what I need to do.
[464:37.91]Location of marked holes.
[464:43.09]New journal.
[464:43.69]Holes.
[464:46.31]Right.
[464:46.63]Well...
[464:48.54]I found them all.
[464:50.34]I think I actually found them all.
[464:51.58]Alright, where is he?
[464:59.26]He's like deeper in, isn't he?
[465:12.45]What the fuck?
[465:13.27]He's not dead?
[465:20.31]What the fuck is this thing made out of?
[465:23.69]What?
[465:36.69]I shot him seven times!
[465:44.72]Where did that guy, where did that thing even come from?
[466:01.00]He had the black shells that need light to die.
[466:03.80]Oh, for the love of God.
[466:07.48]I don't have any bullets.
[466:16.51]So what, I have to shine the light on him?
[466:22.09]Oh my God, this is painful.
[466:34.66]I have nothing in my inventory.
[466:36.20]I have a heal.
[466:39.72]Shine a light.
[466:40.54]I don't have a watch anymore either.
[466:43.18]Yeah, that's great.
[466:44.58]Who knows what time it is right now.
[466:48.00]Okay.
[466:48.50]I don't have any batteries either.
[466:52.20]I don't know.
[466:52.72]Thankfully it keeps those.
[466:54.84]Maybe it realized that that would be awful if it took them out.
[466:59.69]So, I have to shoot him.
[467:01.75]Oh my god, I'm about to exit the game.
[467:19.40]The screen- the door seems to be blocked from the other side.
[467:22.31]Oh, he's getting mad.
[467:28.53]I... I don't wanna do this!
[467:30.82]I was already doing this!
[467:35.08]Here comes the fucking diarrhea face, come on up!
[467:44.94]What happens if you die twice?
[467:47.84]I'm not even in the same spot.
[467:53.38]I have no idea where to go.
[467:57.26]I think it's... I have no idea.
[468:08.43]Shine the light on him.
[468:09.45]Shine the light on him.
[468:10.99]Shine the... What the fuck is happening right now?
[468:17.74]Is this a monster?
[468:43.43]The word thieves has been scratched on the floor.
[468:48.65]I'm not in the right spot.
[468:56.25]I'm not in the correct spot.
[468:58.89]I wish I could have a compass or something.
[469:05.16]Don't do it, please.
[469:23.38]There it is again.
[469:24.10]Alright.
[469:25.62]Here's the tractor.
[469:28.73]But where's the entrance that I went in before?
[469:33.51]I'm lost.
[469:34.03]I'm actually lost.
[469:34.93]I don't know where to go.
[469:50.75]There's this part.
[469:52.73]This is where the backpack was.
[469:54.19]I remember taking this, and then did I go this way?
[469:58.93]No, I went up.
[470:07.87]Well done, steak-sensitive.
[470:09.65]No, it's fucking hard!
[470:13.29]And I'm at like a 9 out of 10 for anger.
[470:16.63]So, like, I am breathing in anger fumes.
[470:20.65]So it's just like... Right now, I don't even have pants on.
[470:30.54]They had to be gone for this.
[470:42.65]So then from here I went... It's just such a blur because everything looks the same!
[470:50.47]Everything's like the same piece of wood and everything's the same, everything's the same!
[470:57.55]Come on out!
[471:00.20]Do it then!
[471:00.84]Stop making flashy sounds and get out here!
[471:04.44]There's nothing even there, it's a joke!
[471:19.76]You know, it also might be that I've been playing this game for eight straight hours.
[471:24.41]Like, eight straight hours of playing this game.
[471:27.69]I think my brain is fried.
[471:52.54]Where's the one little fucking entrance?
[471:55.68]I... I'm gonna stand still.
[472:01.28]Do I go down from here?
[472:04.40]Down.
[472:04.96]Okay.
[472:06.04]Going down.
[472:12.29]Wasn't I just here?
[472:13.15]Now where?
[472:17.09]Through here?
[472:17.47]Through this two inch space?
[472:24.28]This tiny two-inch space is the only place I can go to get down here.
[472:35.72]Oh, I'm fucking taking out the guy.
[472:37.58]I'm gonna shoot this fucking monster in the face 50 times.
[472:39.80]I don't have any... Alright, I'm good.
[473:05.76]You wanna see the pants I'm wearing today?
[473:07.30]They're pajamas.
[473:28.49]I actually just put these on.
[473:34.45]Oh, God, that thing, like, what the fuck?
[473:37.05]I had to hold the light on him until I could drain him, and then shoot him, but he just is biting your fucking face off the whole time, and the dodge, honestly, the dodge mechanic shouldn't even, what's the point of this?
[473:50.96]It just wastes stamina, and then please hurt me.
[474:06.98]What happened in the last fucking 30 minutes of this game?
[474:09.34]Did somebody get into my game and like turn the dial to like 10?
[474:16.29]Alright.
[474:23.85]I got two packages over here that I have to go find.
[474:32.24]You've been playing for too long.
[474:38.77]I'm gonna try this one more time.
[474:42.21]And then I'm going to bed.
[474:54.38]Reload the gun.
[474:55.24]Does he still?
[474:56.44]Uh oh.
[474:57.84]I gotta do it with just sheer will.
[475:02.35]Okay.
[475:03.39]I gotta do it with just sheer will.
[475:05.15]I have to kill it with the axe.
[475:07.50]Because I don't have anything else to kill it with.
[475:11.54]I thought that said a well-seasoned something.
[475:28.23]I just wanted to talk to the old guy.
[475:30.71]Why are you still in this room, dude?
[475:32.55]Go, like, come to the cathedral.
[475:36.75]Alright, what's over here?
[475:37.71]Nothing.
[475:53.51]Reload the gun, please.
[475:58.45]Yeah, fuck you!
[476:01.36]Get the fuck out of here!
[476:03.90]Oh my god!
[476:05.81]You're the worst!
[476:10.71]Can I talk to the old guy now?
[476:12.47]Can I please just talk to the old guy?
[476:14.29]There's another one of these.
[476:20.29]I don't even know where you came from.
[476:22.69]But, you're dead.
[476:23.28]Alright, now I wanna go... Like, up here, somewhere.
[476:34.26]What's in- I don't think I even went in here.
[476:37.92]Have I never been in here?
[476:39.72]Oh, shit.
[476:41.20]There's a lottery ticket!
[476:42.32]Okay, now... Uh, I want my backpack.
[476:59.72]The other backpack was... was it up or down?
[477:02.10]Yeah, it's up.
[477:12.85]I think it's time to go to bed.
[477:31.30]I don't think I get I think I've burnt out completely Down to the left of the eye
[477:44.07]Right, down, left, straight, back, left, up, right.
[477:53.35]Like down here?
[477:54.21]No, that's my... I don't see it in here.
[478:04.54]Go up right of I. I wonder how many people are just fucking with me right now.
[478:14.35]Oh, Jesus Christ almighty, just give me my stuff.
[478:34.51]I don't remember how to get out of here.
[478:38.65]It's like a maze.
[478:39.97]There's one way to go through a whole area.
[478:45.24]Please tell me this is correct.
[478:47.20]I don't care if I... I don't care.
[478:53.42]Is it down from here?
[478:54.34]Over here.
[479:02.31]Ayayay.
[479:03.27]Eight hours, oh megalow.
[479:14.76]It's killing me right now.
[479:22.67]Alright.
[479:24.47]I've made it.
[479:27.01]What a productive day of walking in circles trying to find two backpacks on the ground.
[479:33.94]And I'm not even set up either.
[479:38.93]I got...
[479:40.85]One trap.
[479:41.97]This doorway is in disarray.
[479:44.25]Oh, I'm dead.
[479:45.11]Oh, I'm fucking dead, guys.
[479:49.04]Not a chance in hell.
[479:50.60]I don't even have the generator turned on.
[479:55.61]Let's see if I can kill stuff with an axe.
[480:05.41]If you die this night, then it's going to wipe the save.
[480:07.85]I might have time.
[480:11.27]I think I have time just to at least get one thing built up here.
[480:18.32]What a mess.
[480:27.40]It's like a kid's fucking toy box.
[480:30.94]Just give me wood and nails and I need wood
[480:37.30]It's like, it's time to get rid of some of the toys, son.
[480:43.40]This is all the same image to me.
[480:44.96]This is the same image.
[480:46.18]I... Why do I have so many logs?
[480:53.85]That's a great question.
[480:59.41]Because I spent two days trying to kill a guy with... I'm dead.
[481:05.77]No, I'm not.
[481:06.53]Let's go.
[481:06.97]Fucking come on the house.
[481:07.87]Get in the house.
[481:12.80]It's time.
[481:15.08]Nails are top right.
[481:15.98]Don't worry.
[481:18.56]I'm going to kill everything with the axe.
[481:36.11]Okay.
[481:38.73]Fix the window?
[481:39.55]I physically cannot.
[481:41.71]Unless I get the nails.
[481:49.14]A senile old streamer keels over and dies from a calorie-induced religious nightmare.
[481:57.64]Like, I've been fasting for like eight hours.
[482:04.74]That's fucking funny.
[482:05.78]Alright, let's go.
[482:18.69]Calorie induced.
[482:22.37]An eight hour fast.
[482:24.77]I mean, that's a pretty long time.
[482:32.25]I need a Snickers.
[482:37.73]I can't even eat his stickers.
[482:39.44]Low FODMAP.
[482:40.28]It's in the... it's down... it's right there.
[482:49.26]Here come the ghosts.
[482:59.80]You can't be serious.
[483:13.31]Oh no.
[483:15.13]What if he sees me?
[483:28.50]It's a fucking trap.
[483:48.55]Oh my god!
[484:02.15]You don't kill the banshees.
[484:20.01]Alright.
[484:20.35]Uh, let me take a second.
[484:23.71]Hit and run part two?
[484:24.69]No, no, no, no, no.
[484:26.16]I'm not gonna let it get that far.
[484:27.22]Okay.
[484:33.10]So.
[484:40.89]No, I'm good.
[484:41.57]I'm good.
[484:42.91]I was using that as an excuse.
[484:44.11]Time for bed.
[484:46.53]No.
[484:48.19]Can anyone tell me, realistically, how much time is left in the game?
[484:54.41]Like, how much is left for me to do?
[485:03.84]About, like, two hours?
[485:09.20]Give or take about two hours.
[485:10.24]Okay.
[485:14.40]Between like 20 minutes and 2 hours.
[485:17.46]1 to 2 hours.
[485:22.56]We're gonna do it.
[485:26.16]We're gonna do it.
[485:26.58]So here's what's gonna happen.
[485:34.23]I'm gonna go eat a piece of lettuce.
[485:37.07]I need to walk away from it for a minute.
[485:39.33]We're all good.
[485:40.01]Everything's good.
[485:42.02]I'm going to go eat two or three peanuts.
[485:46.36]And then let's go.
[485:49.94]I'll be right back.
[485:50.80]Don't go anywhere.
[485:51.76]It might be getting late for you, but see you soon.
[486:39.56]Thank you.
[487:21.66]Alright, got some peanuts.
[487:26.96]Dude, it was that smoke monster thing that fucked me all up.
[487:39.67]That was like the catalyst for the near meltdown.
[487:42.17]Which post?
[487:52.58]Show us your peanuts.
[487:54.50]They're very boring.
[487:55.90]But if you want to see them, you can.
[488:03.29]It's just default planters peanuts.
[488:06.33]Nothing special.
[488:16.23]Peanuts are not nuts.
[488:17.75]What do you mean?
[488:26.84]They're legumes.
[488:34.72]Contains a peanut.
[488:38.69]Oh, here we go.
[488:41.79]Oh, here we go.
[488:42.75]Here we go again.
[488:43.51]Here it comes again.
[488:55.00]I wanted to fucking pee my pants, man.
[488:58.24]At that stupid smoke dragon.
[488:59.66]But I didn't get it.
[489:01.21]It's all good.
[489:11.87]Not eating raw peanuts.
[489:12.86]Well, let's think about like, okay, it's been like eight, more than eight hours.
[489:18.28]Should, should I call it?
[489:19.76]No.
[489:21.24]Because realistically speaking, look at this map.
[489:25.07]Well, am I gonna come back and do this for like an hour and ten minutes?
[489:27.91]Like, in a few days?
[489:30.31]No.
[489:31.25]I'm good to go.
[489:33.55]You gotta go all in sometimes.
[489:36.27]Not every time.
[489:48.18]He thinks he's done in two hours.
[490:04.24]Finally some relief for his protein-starved brain.
[490:10.66]I can't- I can't see anything!
[490:13.00]I can't see!
[490:14.44]I can't see anything!
[490:16.04]Where am I?
[490:16.71]Oh my god.
[490:21.81]This is three hours if you know what you're doing.
[490:25.61]Really?
[490:32.68]Wasn't it two hours two hours ago?
[490:34.62]Well, then I got stuck for, like, 40 minutes.
[490:39.52]One to two hours tops.
[490:41.12]Okay.
[490:42.02]Well, whatever.
[490:42.42]Let's just do it.
[490:44.48]It's been a long time since I've had, like, four streams in a row.
[490:47.79]And, like, a stream like this where it's more than eight to ten hours.
[490:49.81]It's been a while.
[490:54.79]We also stopped a fight about steak.
[490:56.23]That's true.
[491:06.63]Just don't get stuck in your own traps.
[491:07.79]That's never not going to happen.
[491:09.68]I could have eaten... I love the protein-starved brain.
[491:18.22]That's hilarious.
[491:23.05]I mean, it's true.
[491:26.47]My diet's been fucked up because I haven't been able to eat certain things.
[491:29.94]But that was quick.
[491:31.34]Did you see?
[491:31.66]That was like a lizard.
[491:35.12]Okay, ready?
[491:35.96]Check this shit out, guys.
[491:36.74]We're taking a little break.
[491:38.10]Watch this one.
[491:42.98]Can't do two in a row?
[491:48.82]My teeth are too big.
[492:01.96]Do I eat weird?
[492:03.89]What do you guys think?
[492:12.17]No not really.
[492:23.94]You eat like a duck.
[492:27.95]Ducks are cool, I'll take it.
[492:36.37]actually people used to in high school and a little bit beyond people would call me a bird they would actually say you eat like a bird because like I I go like this like that I don't know what that why that's a bird I don't know how that I don't know how that's a bird
[493:13.87]I swear to God, this is real.
[493:15.05]I'm not making this up.
[493:16.33]But birds don't have hands.
[493:18.91]I'm just seeing, like, the pelican.
[493:22.74]He, like, picks up the seashell on the beach.
[493:30.00]Do they do that?
[493:35.56]Ugh.
[493:37.52]I'm fucking having a blast.
[493:38.71]Alright.
[493:42.49]I think the blood is flowing back up to my brain again.
[493:51.58]I just keep thinking of everybody that was watching like 15 minutes ago.
[493:55.64]And I'm walking in circles.
[494:01.37]It's fucking making me laugh so much.
[494:13.00]Where I am?
[494:14.76]Where am I?
[494:15.40]Are you alright, dude?
[494:17.88]You need to take a break.
[494:20.58]Protein-starved brain maniac.
[494:28.20]That's fucking hysterical.
[494:32.13]Walking in circles screaming.
[494:34.43]I wasn't screaming.
[494:36.83]Let me see.
[494:37.29]Let me watch a clip or two before I get going.
[494:41.47]Is Derm a psycho?
[494:47.31]I was not screaming.
[494:52.13]I was not screaming.
[494:52.87]I may have laughed loudly.
[494:58.70]Oh no.
[495:00.50]What if he sees me?
[495:09.35]No!
[495:21.07]I don't know.
[495:25.19]I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me.
[495:27.65]It's pretty good water.
[495:34.56]That's not water.
[495:35.38]That's not water.
[495:36.76]Is he alright?
[495:39.02]Kim, go in there and check on him.
[495:40.88]Okay.
[495:47.21]One more.
[495:53.18]Two more.
[495:54.88]Holy shit, I fucking... Oh, wow.
[496:00.29]Holy shit.
[496:04.77]This fucking naked guy wasn't kidding when he said that it gives you superpowers.
[496:15.66]Okay.
[496:18.14]Hi, I'm back.
[496:28.50]So here's what we're gonna do.
[496:30.26]I'm gonna get my stuff.
[496:34.28]Okay, I got a minute here.
[496:53.19]I love how his hair gets worse the longer a stream goes.
[496:56.87]Because I'm sitting in like a hot room for like eight and a half hours.
[497:05.87]Yeah, I'm existing on Earth in like a hot environment.
[497:18.62]Everybody hang out for a minute.
[497:22.28]Let me... There were 50 of them up here, too.
[497:26.04]It was... Look, it was all the same image.
[497:28.41]I'm not kidding.
[497:30.31]Every single one of these icons was the same icon.
[497:36.67]Rub chewed peanuts in your hair.
[497:40.85]No.
[497:46.62]Stop.
[497:48.88]Stop it.
[497:59.71]I'm gonna organize for a second.
[498:05.51]God damn it.
[498:08.09]I gotta pull this together.
[498:13.92]It's real easy to fuck me up right now, I'm telling- I'm gonna be really honest.
[498:19.18]Like, it's very simple.
[498:29.44]okay I got a lot of scrap I'm gonna sell this I'm gonna take I need to why do you have so many logs oh my stomach it was too funny
[499:03.78]Okay, let's do this.
[499:04.48]Alright.
[499:14.88]Let me get... Do I need more gas?
[499:22.27]It's taking over.
[499:25.49]It's the goblin feeder.
[499:26.49]It's taking over.
[499:39.37]I keep thinking of that one comment.
[499:40.75]The calorie-induced nightmare.
[499:42.57]This shit's fucking hilarious.
[499:53.16]Okay.
[499:53.36]Let me get those nails.
[499:55.46]Let's board this place up.
[499:59.40]I have a couple of traps.
[500:00.26]Let's make a trap.
[500:01.18]Make two or three of them.
[500:13.38]Okay.
[500:15.12]Back to reality, like we were, like, 40 minutes ago.
[500:24.87]That's fine.
[500:26.87]Repair this door.
[500:29.29]This one's okay, too.
[500:40.19]Okay.
[500:40.91]Let's do some traps.
[500:49.40]There we go.
[501:02.89]And then I want one more.
[501:04.39]Do I have one more?
[501:06.73]I can do the last one when I come back.
[501:08.45]So this is all set to go.
[501:11.51]It's good.
[501:12.85]It's ready for a night.
[501:15.04]Now, I want to go here.
[501:20.07]To the swamp cottage.
[501:20.95]Anything else I can do with you guys?
[501:49.64]Battery.
[501:54.61]Bullet.
[501:57.65]Okay.
[501:58.89]And gas.
[501:59.47]Because I'm burning out.
[502:03.83]Yeah.
[502:06.62]Very good.
[502:08.40]Do a nut chug.
[502:09.22]I just did.
[502:21.76]Okay.
[502:22.90]So that can be deposited.
[502:23.96]I got three clips.
[502:28.42]This shit has to be sold.
[502:31.47]Battery.
[502:32.81]Gas.
[502:33.49]Hunting rifle.
[502:34.09]Reloaded.
[502:45.07]Sell the knife too.
[502:45.77]I don't need it.
[502:46.29]I got a great axe.
[502:49.21]And the fabric.
[502:53.04]That should let me just essentially buy a shotgun shell.
[502:56.90]I'm going to need it eventually.
[502:57.92]Okay.
[502:58.02]You're going to get stomachache if you eat too many peanuts?
[503:08.91]I mean, I eat peanut butter all the time.
[503:10.97]Peanut butter is like one of my favorite things in the world.
[503:18.43]It's got tons of protein, tons of vitamins for you.
[503:25.44]Peanut butter is incredible.
[503:26.64]You know you can live off of peanut butter?
[503:27.88]Do you know that?
[503:36.57]Okay.
[503:42.49]I'm ready to go.
[503:43.01]I am prepared.
[503:45.43]I got all my shit.
[503:47.11]I got some heals, right?
[503:48.35]That's one thing I don't have.
[503:49.09]My heals?
[503:50.39]Yeah.
[503:50.59]I'm gonna bring some more, too, just in case.
[503:57.44]Bingo.
[503:59.08]Now.
[504:01.54]I want to head down here to the swamp cottage.
[504:07.74]Everything's done.
[504:09.17]Crunchy or smooth?
[504:09.79]Smooth.
[504:10.03]I don't have anything... I don't... This is not one of those, like, Here we go!
[504:14.59]He's gonna... Here we go!
[504:15.29]No.
[504:15.61]It's... I like them both.
[504:18.85]But smooth is... I like it better.
[504:21.39]I eat it with a spoon.
[504:27.02]Incorrect.
[504:28.54]That's okay.
[504:30.66]Alright, let's go check out and see what this is.
[504:32.83]This guy with the mask on.
[504:34.27]I need a mask.
[504:36.01]I need a mask.
[504:38.17]Holy shit, I need a mask.
[504:42.59]Let's go.
[504:42.95]Let's go.
[504:57.30]Alright, come on.
[505:02.87]That's the power of peanuts.
[505:04.25]I almost just dropped my mouse.
[505:10.21]This has to be way higher.
[505:21.01]Still have this.
[505:23.14]It's alright.
[505:31.13]It is that.
[505:31.95]I was wondering what the fuck that was.
[505:33.83]It's little tendrils.
[505:35.01]Okay, remember I didn't know what was going on there?
[505:37.21]Now I know.
[505:40.30]I just had to see and look where the things were coming from.
[505:46.38]And I was able to focus on it very clearly.
[505:48.22]Because that's the power of peanuts.
[505:52.53]Look it, I'm already back.
[506:04.36]Alright, where's this cottage?
[506:05.38]Right here?
[506:17.38]No, down further?
[506:22.12]Creamy or crunchy?
[506:22.86]I like creamy peanut butter better than crunchy.
[506:25.28]It's not... I love crunchy peanut butter.
[506:29.42]But if I had to choose, it would be creamy.
[506:32.52]I like it better on sandwiches if you spread peanut butter and fluff.
[506:37.92]It's an all-time classic, one of my favorite sandwiches pretty much ever when I was a kid.
[506:43.19]I have a soft spot for peanuts.
[506:59.63]Okay, okay, hold on a second here.
[507:16.66]Goddamn, you guys take a lot of hits.
[507:26.80]I'm just keeping the hunting rifle out.
[507:43.81]I mean, I'm here.
[507:46.80]How do I get in here?
[507:55.16]What the hell have you done?!
[508:04.75]Holy fuck.
[508:09.11]I thought he was in front of me.
[508:14.10]I really thought he was in front of me.
[508:15.24]That scared the fucking shit out of me.
[508:20.42]Is there a better way I can get up there?
[508:21.62]Here we go.
[508:40.21]Gas tank.
[508:49.42]Watch out for that thing.
[508:55.02]You got a lot of these.
[508:56.60]What?
[508:57.15]Okay.
[508:57.63]Just me.
[508:58.01]That's me doing that.
[509:10.51]The cottage is surrounded by a barricade made out of old furniture and rusty barbed wire, probably stolen from some fence.
[509:21.22]That's a lot of scrap metal.
[509:28.25]What are you doing to me?
[509:30.53]Is there one down here, too?
[509:36.86]Barricaded.
[509:40.76]I still don't understand.
[509:41.56]How do I...
[509:59.27]That's another trap!
[510:09.22]I'm panicking about these things.
[510:12.93]I don't need to be panicking.
[510:14.11]Those things are not that big of a deal.
[510:16.39]Yes, they are.
[510:17.01]Yes, they are.
[510:17.71]Yes, they are.
[510:18.53]Are they?
[510:27.31]Got it.
[510:27.63]I still don't understand.
[510:29.07]What are they doing?
[510:33.88]When my back is turned, they... Destroy generator.
[510:47.46]What?
[510:48.02]Should I do this?
[510:59.72]Did one come up through the soil?
[511:05.48]Am I getting pranked?
[511:11.25]Intense smell of flowers fills the air.
[511:12.95]I need a key.
[511:21.79]Thank you for fixing our generator.
[511:24.13]You can come in.
[511:38.84]What?
[511:39.40]Elephants.
[511:43.14]The air is filled with a suffocating sweet odor of rot.
[511:45.92]Who are you?
[511:47.20]The woman is wearing a heavy, ruined coat.
[511:48.88]Her voice is suppressed by the cracked gas mask she's wearing.
[511:53.97]Can't you speak?
[511:54.59]Did someone take away your voice?
[511:56.67]To... Children, hide behind the woman.
[512:04.57]One eye in me.
[512:06.98]Scared.
[512:08.54]Standing there.
[512:09.20]Other one.
[512:10.00]Scared.
[512:12.66]Enough from around here.
[512:14.18]Would recognize you.
[512:15.12]We made it keep to ourselves, but I know everyone here.
[512:16.82]I would never forget you a mug.
[512:20.73]Can't make the joke I don't have a mug in the room.
[512:24.05]The younger child.
[512:25.25]Eyes.
[512:28.31]Your gob looks like that because of this fiendish air, do you know?
[512:32.48]Bet you can't speak.
[512:33.66]Because you didn't keep your mouth shut when walking through the woods.
[512:37.81]The trees and plains are simply beautiful here, and the bushes bloom gorgeously this time of year, but don't let the charm of this land deceive you.
[512:43.89]The devil lurks.
[512:45.23]The devil lurks between these trees, and he gets to you through your mouth and nose.
[512:49.46]Can I just make the devil mad?
[512:54.06]The old child's grasp on his mother's hand tightens.
[512:57.91]He does not lift his gaze from one of his hut's walls.
[513:02.87]and you're just gonna stand there I know you want something you leper demon you're not getting anything from us I don't trust you leopard gob do you hear me I don't trust you anyone who breathes this filthy air the woman stares at me intensely through the cracked mask did you take my marcenec was it you who kidnapped him talk no that cannot be the woman stares at the floor her greasy black hair drops down on her mask it's impossible
[513:32.55]Stupid child.
[513:33.09]He went out and never came back.
[513:34.13]He was on about how his granny will take him mushrooming.
[513:37.43]I have no idea where he... I told him he cannot go outside.
[513:40.52]I told him that he... The devil.
[513:42.56]I told him that the devil will find him.
[513:44.88]Take off his mask and take him away.
[513:47.38]I would look for him, but... She lowers her head even more.
[513:51.23]As if observing the dead fly stuck to her coat.
[513:54.81]What do you think about this road?
[513:55.79]I remember this road.
[513:56.35]The woods devoured it about three years ago.
[513:57.87]Used to lead to our village.
[513:58.79]I walked it to school.
[514:00.51]The road home.
[514:00.93]My road home.
[514:25.21]Something exploded in the northern part of the swamp, made the ground tremble.
[514:28.89]Devil knows what it was.
[514:30.13]I see you're curious.
[514:31.97]Investigate it if you have a death wish.
[514:33.43]I think it happened in the junkyard.
[514:34.89]Oh, I've been there already, lady.
[514:38.57]The youngest child, hidden behind the woman's back until now, finally finds the courage to make a small step towards me.
[514:45.48]One little bear ate a little soup.
[514:48.75]Then another one came in.
[514:51.15]Quiet.
[514:52.03]The woman smacks the boy in the back of the head.
[514:54.03]The punch is so hard, the hood of his rubber cloak lands on his mask's visor.
[514:58.56]Not now, not in front of a stranger.
[515:03.59]You're just like these lunatics who roam around the woods searching for God knows what.
[515:07.24]There used to be more of them.
[515:08.62]Guess most of them starved to death.
[515:11.22]I remember when they appeared not far from here.
[515:12.94]Must have been around two years ago.
[515:14.50]Around two dozen of them.
[515:16.62]They were led by these three weirdos dressed in old rags.
[515:20.12]They set up camp at the marsh there between the trees.
[515:23.65]They watched our house, stared right into my windows.
[515:26.78]The oddities.
[515:28.04]I thought they wanted to kidnap my children or harm them in some way.
[515:31.29]But when the night fell, I lost sight of them.
[515:33.49]There was no one there in the morning.
[515:37.24]Apart from these two here and Marcenek, there's one more boy of mine, my precious darling and blessed child.
[515:43.33]The woman rests her hands on the oxygen tanks, and the children standing beside her.
[515:48.19]His love fills our tanks with clean air.
[515:51.21]For this we are forever grateful to him, for the clean air, for the oxygen tanks, for these beautiful masks, and the book in which the devil, after just making the devil mad, has revealed his true image, along with his evil plan, my son took it away from the trees with his own hands.
[516:07.46]Brought it here to us.
[516:08.16]Hmm.
[516:12.79]Okay.
[516:14.93]I'll be taking those masks now, lady.
[516:20.09]Quest time.
[516:25.59]Junk.
[516:26.95]Okay.
[516:32.84]Use the kid's key.
[516:40.17]Odd looking mushroom.
[516:42.95]Old doormat drawings.
[516:49.16]Creepy mushroom drawings.
[516:53.72]And an old doormat.
[516:55.22]An old doormat?
[516:55.90]I think someone uses it as a bed.
[516:57.55]Fold.
[516:59.21]Small bundle.
[517:00.61]There's a map.
[517:01.85]A simple map scribbled on a piece of crumpled paper.
[517:04.19]Judging by the drawings, it was made by a child.
[517:06.89]It's very inaccurate.
[517:08.73]I will only be able to find the approximate position of the spot indicated on the map.
[517:12.95]Did somebody open up Wowhead for me?
[517:25.50]I made another fucking wild reference.
[517:31.84]I don't even play that game.
[517:37.47]Where the fuck is it?
[517:37.97]I don't care.
[517:45.39]Where is it?
[517:46.33]I don't care.
[517:46.89]Just tell me where it is.
[517:47.57]I don't care.
[517:59.61]Wait, my generator's still on?
[518:05.56]Okay, where is he?
[518:06.50]Mushroom glade?
[518:07.26]Where though?
[518:07.78]Just like, exact location.
[518:11.74]I want exact location.
[518:14.06]Here?
[518:20.03]Right here.
[518:24.65]Right here?
[518:28.72]The map is randomly generated.
[518:30.24]Oh, fuck.
[518:32.20]Wonderful.
[518:34.18]Alright, time to go find this kid.
[518:39.07]And... Get the mask.
[518:44.37]Turn on smart clicks.
[518:47.39]Not a bad idea.
[518:49.36]Genius.
[518:57.58]That's it.
[519:16.95]Okay.
[519:17.95]I have a good general idea.
[519:20.96]Where it is.
[519:21.82]Thank you.
[519:22.16]Appreciate that.
[519:26.58]I'm gonna say it's right here.
[519:28.52]Looking for a kid.
[519:30.38]Alright.
[519:30.62]I still have some time.
[519:32.12]I'm gonna go up.
[519:33.00]I'm gonna go this way anyways.
[519:34.87]I'm going for it.
[519:35.33]Let's go.
[519:35.69]Right now.
[519:39.19]Wait.
[519:39.85]This is... This is on them.
[519:42.97]Right?
[519:43.33]Should I turn it off?
[519:44.63]That's on them, right?
[519:51.26]That's on them.
[519:51.76]Alright, let's go.
[519:57.84]See if I can find them right now.
[519:59.16]Quickly.
[520:04.39]Oh, it's up here.
[520:16.39]Go back home.
[520:18.19]I'm literally right there.
[520:19.55]I'm going to just try it.
[520:22.27]We're going Power Peanuts right now.
[520:30.08]This shit is crap.
[520:31.08]I don't even know why I'm picking it up anymore.
[520:38.12]Alright, here we go.
[520:41.00]Finding the kid and the mushrooms.
[520:47.20]At 16, I'm out.
[520:51.31]Looking for a kid.
[520:53.75]Looking for a kid.
[521:02.66]Okay, here I am.
[521:05.68]Looking for a kid.
[521:06.72]And he leads.
[521:15.18]Right here, come on, right here.
[521:16.66]Right here, right here, he's right here.
[521:26.96]There he is.
[521:27.34]What?
[521:29.36]Footprints.
[521:29.98]Footprints.
[521:30.74]What?
[521:31.06]What?
[521:31.36]Whose footprints are these?
[521:32.10]Where did they go?
[521:52.96]Footprints.
[521:53.61]But where?
[521:54.63]Oh, you... Just do them all.
[521:56.81]Do them all.
[521:57.11]Quick.
[521:57.69]Do them alright now.
[522:10.14]It stacks.
[522:11.40]It stacks!
[522:12.22]It stacks!
[522:13.37]It stacks!
[522:22.10]Oh my god, it stacks!
[522:30.34]Where's this kid?
[522:33.94]Where the fuck is this kid?
[522:35.28]Where the fuck are you?
[522:36.92]Get over here.
[522:46.87]Come on, kid.
[522:47.55]I don't got all day.
[523:03.76]Everything inside the car is covered with mushrooms, the floor, even the... Hey.
[523:06.06]Hey, what's up?
[523:08.36]The color is goo, seeps in the ceiling.
[523:09.80]What's up, kid?
[523:11.42]Mushroom Granny.
[523:14.18]Wake up.
[523:33.56]The old lady slowly opens her eyes from when she stares into space with an absent gaze.
[523:37.70]Finally, she becomes aware of my presence.
[523:39.32]Great, you're not.
[523:41.54]Her empty eyes now take on a questioning expression.
[523:45.18]I didn't expect guests.
[523:47.36]She throws a nervous look at the door on her right.
[523:50.59]Kid's in there.
[523:51.53]She then gazes around the mushroom-infested house.
[523:53.93]She relaxes a bit.
[523:58.31]I suppose you won't tell me what you want, and you want something since you're standing here in front of me.
[524:03.35]Point your finger at the... What are you doing?
[524:21.74]Get away!
[524:22.84]I bite into her.
[524:23.84]The mushroom juice squirts onto my face.
[524:28.25]I feel the woman's feeble hands trying to push me away, but... Oh, I'm... My hunger is too great.
[524:34.23]I bite her face.
[524:35.35]I swallow a chunk of her body.
[524:37.79]What the fuck?
[524:59.69]Matt?
[525:01.47]Hey!
[525:03.81]Look at these drawings!
[525:04.87]Whoa!
[525:06.49]Hey!
[525:06.83]Look at these drawings you got here, son!
[525:12.33]Wow!
[525:13.15]Oh, hey, I just want to help you here.
[525:16.17]I'm not gonna, I just, I want to get you out of here, son.
[525:20.74]Will you come with me, son?
[525:27.36]Hey, just... Hold on there.
[525:49.30]The boy is terrified.
[525:50.28]Slowly he slumps down from the wall to the ground, curling into a ball.
[525:53.30]The murmur turns into a loud recitation.
[525:57.39]One little bear ate a bowl of soup.
[525:59.49]Then another bear came and there were two.
[526:01.67]Four little bears made a sudden poo-ow.
[526:05.29]Along came the fifth and took a little bow.
[526:07.18]You ain't very good at counting, son.
[526:10.94]Put the boy on your back and lead him to his family.
[526:16.08]When I take the boy into my arms, he starts screaming, reciting the rhyme over and over.
[526:22.20]Granny?! !
[526:47.05]You brought back my child.
[526:49.51]The woman leads towards the boy.
[526:50.77]Marcin, where have you been?
[526:51.97]The boy stares at the ground in silence.
[526:55.42]Come here.
[526:56.14]Marcin walks towards the woman, nervously plucking at his old torn sweater.
[526:59.62]Look at you.
[526:59.92]Where's your mask and the gas tank from your gracious brother?
[527:05.25]His love protects us.
[527:06.35]It fills our lungs with clean air.
[527:07.96]And this is how you thank him, young man?
[527:10.40]Your childish behavior made him very, very angry.
[527:13.36]Now we'll have to apologize to him for your stupidity.
[527:16.90]The two kids standing behind their mother flinch.
[527:20.76]The woman grabs the boy's hand and disappears in the hallway.
[527:23.15]After a while, she comes back with an oxygen tank.
[527:29.23]Take it.
[527:30.35]It's a thank you.
[527:31.33]It's a tank you.
[527:35.68]Hilarious.
[527:37.38]Um... Okay.
[527:40.99]It will... You're gonna pull out, like, fucking dad humor right now?
[527:46.48]It'll protect you from this devilish air, the devil's breath, and other evils lurking in this foul place.
[527:51.17]It's the only thing I have and the only thing I can give you.
[527:53.29]The tank is a little rusty, but it seems intact.
[527:55.43]On the side, I can see some unintelligible scribblings.
[528:00.31]The valve opens with a little resistance, but I don't hear the hiss of air.
[528:04.10]It's empty.
[528:08.88]Do not open the valve without need.
[528:10.16]You will only waste the clean air.
[528:11.46]She pushes my hand away from the valve and closes it hastily.
[528:13.92]May it serve you well.
[528:25.02]I need to find oxygen.
[528:28.38]Time to go home.
[528:35.17]Now where is oxygen?
[528:42.21]Take the oxygen back.
[528:47.45]The granny could have made you a sweater.
[528:51.72]Then another bear came and there were two, four little bears.
[528:54.13]Alright, I gotta leave.
[528:56.07]Back to the hideout.
[529:03.95]I can't believe you can eat people in this game.
[529:09.35]That's kind of insanity.
[529:11.14]Okay, up this way.
[529:23.48]Be ready for anything.
[529:24.27]I'm not getting stuck out in this goddamn wasteland.
[529:32.09]By the way, uh, run.
[529:49.92]Your calorie-deficient brain saw Granny and only thought, run.
[530:02.26]I'm currently running.
[530:04.60]So that was the thing that came up.
[530:11.32]Yeah, remember I killed the guy in the village for being a cannibal?
[530:15.45]Well, I didn't have very good influences here.
[530:23.34]This ain't my house.

[530:29.70]Oh, they broke the wall.
[530:43.35]Okay, the... It's f***ing every time.
[530:51.43]There is no cooking anymore.

[531:18.63]I got time.
[531:19.50]And the room's all set up anyways.
[531:36.77]Oh yeah, that was a good nut chug.
[531:39.47]Easy.
[531:40.85]I know you guys are fucked up.
[531:42.53]Alright.

[534:03.24]We'll see.
[534:26.74]Don't want to have dry lips, so... I'm not reading that one.
[534:29.56]I don't even know how to react to some of these.
[534:49.77]Ah, I thought it was gonna be a huge strike.

[539:54.68]Okay.
[539:55.66]A tank filled with oxygen.
[540:10.54]Okay.
[540:11.70]So.
[540:18.33]If it's just oxygen, it won't be good.
[540:24.20]Go back to the village of hell.
[540:27.08]That's where I was planning on going.
[540:29.48]Not yet, though.
[540:33.94]Do I have... Any more bullets?
[540:35.94]I have two more bullets for this.
[540:40.55]I didn't... I didn't make it to the shotgun.
[540:44.07]But I think I'm gonna make the shotgun.
[540:50.07]Antidote.
[540:51.57]No, no, don't make it!

[541:52.99]I'm going to make it.
[541:57.02]Am I at endgame here?
[542:03.91]I'm about to click this.

[542:44.34]I got plenty of heals.
[542:45.32]I don't know.
[542:46.94]I didn't make it.
[542:47.72]I never came across a machine gun.
[542:56.02]Repair everything.
[542:58.02]Even if I don't think I'm going to use it.
[543:04.00]Can't be prepared to upgrade.

[544:06.34]So I've got what I need.
[544:09.80]I'm ready.
[544:11.12]Let's just make sure that this place is not going to fall apart completely.
[544:14.90]I'm going to use all of my materials that I have.
[544:19.81]Are you ready for this?
[544:20.93]Are you ready for me to fuck this whole thing up?
[544:55.08]You're in my house now.
[544:57.91]Oh, this whole time I played this game.
[545:00.39]The ups and the downs.
[545:02.11]The frustration sometimes.
[545:04.92]The anger.
[545:05.52]The fun.
[545:06.36]The ingenuity.
[545:07.22]The great game.
[545:09.00]This whole room is going to be a trap.
[545:11.18]And I'm going to stuff myself in the corner.
[545:15.72]And good luck.
[545:17.21]You monsters.
[545:18.15]Because you ain't going to get in this room.
[545:22.05]So let's strategically do this.
[545:26.45]It's going to be this room.
[545:35.04]I need an absolute guaranteed path to be able to come back in here.
[545:41.53]The escape route is going to be... Straight.
[545:46.33]Up.
[545:48.01]Out.
[545:48.19]I need to bring this... The lamp is going to be right in the middle.
[545:58.96]Here's your free bingo space.
[546:03.72]And then I'm thinking we got, here's my safe spot.
[546:07.93]They come in through here, they come in through here.
[546:10.83]They need to be just like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[546:13.03]But I need a space like this to be able to run this way and walk.
[546:19.14]This is the escape.
[546:22.88]Up here.
[546:23.12]I'm going to leave this here.
[546:27.28]Here we go.
[546:29.58]So, if I need to go this way, let's start with here.
[546:37.57]And I'm going to give myself plenty of room.
[546:54.57]What happened?
[546:57.59]Do it.
[547:18.53]You don't think I'm preparing for the final goddamn battle?
[547:30.08]I'm preparing, alright.
[547:49.53]Okay.
[547:49.99]Then here.
[548:06.50]So this is my... This is still safe?
[548:12.76]This is still safe here, right?
[548:21.15]I have to hug the wall.
[548:26.75]This chair has to get out of here.
[548:45.46]Times three, what?
[548:47.38]A triple Jupiter?
[548:51.59]Stop with the Jupiters, I wanna watch the stream.
[548:54.58]What the fuck.
[549:05.60]Then, look away from chat.
[549:15.89]Alright, just don't.
[549:17.11]How many more do I have?
[549:20.30]I think I have like three or four more.

[549:28.01]Two, three, four.
[549:34.44]Can't make any more.
[549:35.52]Only four, right?
[549:39.30]Okay.
[549:39.86]These have got to be in a good spot.
[549:51.49]I can now no longer leave from here.
[550:30.78]Good.
[550:34.30]Whoever decides to come in this room, good luck.
[550:41.44]You ain't fucking making it.
[550:42.64]Okay, it's good.
[550:46.88]It's safe.
[550:47.36]This is gonna go in the corner.
[550:50.33]I want to build a door.
[550:59.65]Good spot for that lamp.
[551:03.07]This is still... I could use a little work.
[551:07.26]But fuck it.
[551:07.72]Who cares?
[551:08.10]They're not going to make it anyways.
[551:12.76]That door needs to be sealed.
[551:16.22]So does this one.
[551:21.62]Okay.
[551:22.91]So I have to come in through this way.
[551:25.01]Seal this door, seal this door.
[551:29.95]Yeah, this one gets fortified.
[551:31.51]This one does not.
[551:32.21]It's the only way I can get in.

[559:47.82]Yeah, because this is going too far up.
[559:59.21]I'll do the run so I don't have to do this.
[560:08.52]Um, okay, is it... did I have it right the first time?
[560:18.00]Where's that little piece?

[561:58.47]Is old man down or old man up?
[562:07.83]Let's go this way.
[562:16.16]Oh, this is where I could have done the digging!
[562:19.70]Dammit.
[562:20.03]Alright, I gotta be prepared for this, because there's probably something scary here.
[562:27.65]Alright, this is the tree.
[562:40.06]Old man's up here, alright.
[562:47.89]Is he in the other room?
[562:48.67]Which room is he in?
[562:51.85]Basement hatch.
[562:54.75]Wait.
[562:59.03]What?
[562:59.91]He's not here.
[563:02.41]Wait, I was already here.
[563:06.81]I'm down here.
[563:33.69]A hole in the wall of the basement.
[563:35.71]It must have been made by the growing roots.
[563:40.80]Can I throw the... Throw the gas tank in there?
[563:48.58]Where's this motherfucker's brain?
[563:50.50]Is what I want to know.
[563:53.21]Who's there?
[563:55.76]What do you want?
[563:57.36]Leave.
[563:58.66]Cellar under the tree.
[563:59.74]My feet are slowly sinking in the soft, quaggy floor.
[564:03.44]I can barely move because someone's holding me by the ankles.
[564:06.48]What?
[564:09.09]I have the oxygen tank in here!
[564:20.43]Okay, so... Wait, how do I burn it?
[564:29.51]What?
[564:31.17]Giant barrel.
[564:32.33]A huge rusty barrel, judging by the smell, still contains a lot of gasoline.
[564:35.35]I need a match.
[564:44.31]What if I... How do you explode something underwater?
[564:47.80]I don't have any weapons or anything, do I?
[564:53.24]Nothing.
[565:04.71]Another one.
[565:05.33]Huge barrel of gasoline.
[565:13.29]That person's very big.
[565:15.23]That person's huge.
[565:17.09]Um... Why are these people so big?
[565:27.64]What was in there?
[565:29.66]What's going on?
[565:38.06]Axe.
[565:38.68]Oh no.
[565:42.82]Are you serious?
[565:45.11]Just blow it up!
[565:49.87]Why is this here?
[566:13.38]I could blow it up, right?
[566:19.60]Barricade.
[566:20.12]Makeshift barricade blocking the entrance to the basement.
[566:22.95]Someone or something is trying to break through from the other side.
[566:30.47]What?
[566:35.16]How the fuck do I do anything?
[566:42.14]What the hell do you think you're doing?
[566:43.28]Wait.
[566:47.58]You'll kill us all.
[566:49.43]Stop it.
[567:04.81]What's in here?
[567:05.35]The item is no longer usable.
[567:08.59]I need to repair it.
[567:09.85]A makeshift barricade.
[567:17.56]What do I do?
[567:26.77]What do I do?
[567:30.28]Get me back out of here!
[567:52.28]You're not supposed to die.
[567:57.99]Where the fuck am I?
[567:58.93]Am I back on?
[568:05.67]Do I get to do it again?
[568:06.35]I'm supposed to do it again.
[568:12.78]I couldn't go down the... Wait, what the fuck is happening?
[568:32.73]Ow, don't.
[568:37.53]Pile of empty, rotten crates overgrown with roots.
[568:43.63]Oh, that was just a dream.
[568:46.00]Valve.
[568:47.12]The barrel's valve is rusted, but it seems to be working, judging by the smell that's gaffling inside.
[568:58.31]Gasoline starts to leak out of the barrel.
[568:59.97]It slowly flows down the tunnel.
[569:07.62]This tunnel looks different.
[569:08.56]It was carved up by people sloppily and hastily.
[569:10.50]It's a miracle it still hasn't collapsed yet.
[569:12.14]The further part of the tunnel is blocked by rubble.
[569:18.68]Looking through a crack, I see giant pulsating roots.
[569:21.35]Maybe I can find a way to destroy them.
[569:22.63]Let's light it up.
[570:04.69]Will I die from this?
[570:05.41]Should I leave?
[570:16.31]This way.
[570:40.77]Just leave.
[570:41.33]I wanted to see what was down here.
[570:47.98]Where's the hatch?
[570:48.76]Oh, it's over here.
[570:56.78]Did I forget about the...
[571:14.12]Well, I... When somebody tells me to leave, I think, okay, I came through this door.
[571:20.14]So that's the door I came through.
[571:21.40]That's where I'm going to leave from.
[571:24.34]It didn't happen.
[571:25.84]The dream was not real life.
[571:27.90]We've been having dreams all fucking night.
[571:34.14]I've been having dreams for 30 days.
[571:35.62]I thought you guys said to come back down here.
[571:46.45]I can't see a goddamn thing.
[571:53.53]I can't destroy it.
[572:01.01]I can't break it.
[572:10.64]Did you guys...
[572:12.30]Did you guys seriously, seriously just make me do this and call me all kinds of names?
[572:33.28]It was just a joke.
[572:35.54]Don't pretend you did that on purpose.
[572:37.24]I did, I was trying to leave the zone.
[572:49.72]You guys are fucking too much.
[572:59.87]Alright, let me get out of here.
[573:03.12]It's burning.
[573:04.64]I was going the right way.
[573:31.51]No.
[573:32.03]Whether he true or not, yields to the flame sleaze and tries to smother the fire with the fruits of ice.
[573:35.77]It should be all over tomorrow.
[573:41.03]That's... Fuck it.
[573:43.07]Come back tomorrow.
[573:47.29]Ah, it's too bad.
[573:47.89]We'll come back tomorrow.
[573:49.07]It should be done by then.
[573:50.12]Hey, you... Hey!
[573:52.74]Hey, dude, you wanna...
[573:54.59]You want to go to Sonic?
[573:55.89]They got these bomb tater tots at Sonic.
[573:58.79]Yeah.
[573:59.51]Except I quite put cheese on mine.
[574:01.11]Yeah.
[574:01.71]Dude, get out of here.
[574:03.25]You're a funny guy.
[574:13.58]Where's the old man?
[574:17.62]Come here now.
[574:18.36]Come.
[574:25.85]Stop!
[574:25.95]Okay.
[575:21.92]I'm sorry.
[575:23.12]I didn't mean to.
[575:24.00]I just... I was all that I was trying to split go.
[575:36.50]What the fuck?
[575:38.08]Why did I do that?
[575:41.78]I got...
[575:47.22]Okay, I'm gonna... I'm gonna fucking puke.
[576:02.64]It's screaming.
[576:09.38]Jeez, man.
[576:10.20]I'm sorry.
[576:13.66]I didn't think anybody would...
[576:22.58]No, no, I'm not laughing at the... At which... I didn't think he was an important story person.
[576:31.34]And I really didn't mean to do that either.
[576:33.34]It was... I was sitting there like this, and then I pressed it.
[576:37.08]I think... I thought I was far... I thought I was far away.
[576:39.46]I didn't think I was close enough to kill him.
[576:41.49]And I can't talk over this.
[576:45.09]The guy... Oh, that person gave you the quest.
[576:53.06]Okay, I'm gonna fucking actually die.
[576:56.80]Don't board these windows.
[576:59.38]I'm not gonna restart the game.
[577:15.72]Oh, my fucking whole body hurts.
[577:20.64]What was that?
[577:30.42]Oh my god, that's that might be like that's that's that's I thought I was I Have to get the fuck out of here You're gonna make me use a lockpick to get out of here Every day I can hear him more clearly
[577:57.92]What are you talking about?
[577:59.22]I have to get out of here now.
[578:09.46]There's nobody there.
[578:11.60]I didn't kill that person.
[578:13.21]Three murders.
[578:17.53]Oh my god.
[578:18.21]I have to heal.
[578:19.77]I have to heal before I die.
[578:21.17]Do I have any heals?
[578:26.94]That's like, that was so fucking funny to me.
[578:29.69]I'm sorry, it was.
[578:32.05]Everybody freaked the fuck out.
[578:34.71]I thought it was just a guy.
[578:35.85]I didn't think... No.
[578:42.63]It was just everybody's reaction.
[578:45.65]And... Ugh, finally I'm out of the screams.
[579:03.33]just too much you just kill people or you you oh so you just kill people first no no you killed him while he was admiring the fire I thought he was gonna die oh my goodness
[579:43.04]You guys are fucking hilarious.
[579:45.08]Like, seriously.
[579:46.94]That's the hardest I've laughed.
[579:48.18]Just at what you guys were saying.
[579:49.38]At least a month.
[579:55.16]I kept seeing, like, nut chug and stuff.
[579:57.42]Like, you need... There was so much going on there for my brain.
[580:00.63]And I'm, like, already, like, kind of tired.
[580:02.25]I didn't... That's, like, the one person... God damn it, man.
[580:23.48]Okay.
[580:24.96]Let's survive.
[580:26.26]Another night.
[580:30.44]I may have missed some story there.
[580:32.88]Unfortunately.
[580:35.46]But it's okay because I almost threw up.
[580:37.01]I actually did.
[580:37.75]I would have actually... I probably would have been suspended from Twitch if that went on any longer.
[580:47.41]It would have been like... Just... Let's go.
[580:57.87]Let's go.
[580:58.45]Turn it on.
[580:58.89]I don't even... Is there anything else for me to do?
[581:07.22]You literally axed the story.
[581:22.71]I need to sit here for a minute.
[581:26.94]This game was fun.
[581:29.18]This was a fun game.
[581:31.40]I'm glad you all got to experience it with me.
[581:34.80]Thank you.
[581:47.55]Okay, I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna sit here.
[581:52.43]I need like... It's good that I'm not gonna be streaming for like a few days.
[581:57.96]Because that actually took like probably a year off my life just laughing at that.
[582:04.82]Right, okay.
[582:07.96]Peanut coma.
[582:10.88]Let's just get it going.
[582:15.74]Fill it up.
[582:16.50]And you know what?
[582:17.60]Let's just go full-blown.
[582:20.68]Who cares?
[582:22.49]You want to see some shit?
[582:23.79]I'll show you some shit.
[582:51.53]I almost just walked in the room.
[583:08.16]Drew a dick.
[583:26.35]I didn't mean... Oh my goodness.
[583:29.91]I'm just gonna go in a circle.
[583:37.46]I didn't do it again.
[583:38.48]That's very... That's a cloud.
[583:40.00]That is a... That is a... That is a cumulonimbus cloud.
[584:10.86]I want to use the shotgun.
[584:15.70]Eat the shotgun?
[584:16.60]No.
[584:17.32]Oh, right.
[584:19.11]Alright.
[584:20.61]Boot it up.
[584:37.39]You ready?
[584:38.73]This is the last night.
[584:39.63]I'm gonna torch this place.
[585:19.30]Wait I didn't get any wood
[585:49.10]Oh, fuck it.
[585:49.94]Watch this shit.
[585:50.96]Oh, no.
[585:52.19]Oh, that's not good.
[585:53.73]Very bad.
[585:54.33]It's okay.
[585:56.23]I would... I don't even need it.
[586:07.42]I'm going completely insanity mode here.
[586:11.20]You think I need a doorway?
[586:15.33]I have a shotgun.
[587:13.19]Silent creepy Jerma.
[587:14.73]It's okay.
[587:27.90]Is this time going slower?
[587:31.47]Shouldn't be.
[587:35.33]You will not leave this room without stepping on a trap.
[587:39.11]Maybe.
[587:42.66]I think I'm in a good spot, though.
[587:44.32]Because whoever is getting... Where's my rifle?
[587:48.18]That's probably a better bet to have... Oh, yeah, for sure.
[587:51.97]Definitely the rifle.
[587:53.21]Because I'm just going to put it between the eyes.
[587:57.35]My accuracy sucks.
[588:03.23]Shotgun.
[588:03.87]Better spread.
[588:10.08]E-F.
[588:10.30]E-F.
[588:36.25]Why?
[588:38.48]Why did you kill me?
[588:40.64]Why did you do it?
[588:59.42]Is the house on fire?
[589:02.38]Wait, didn't I do that?
[589:07.15]What?
[589:29.31]Huh?
[589:37.87]What happened?
[589:38.33]Who was it?
[590:10.34]What?
[590:18.62]Oh shit!
[591:08.78]I think I did it.
[591:25.79]Alright, cool.
[591:27.69]I did it.
[591:28.01]Now get me the fuck out of here.
[591:40.64]What the fuck?
[591:42.84]Oh, the eyes are gone.
[591:45.77]What about that tree?
[591:54.07]Tree.
[592:02.54]Everything's dying.
[592:05.51]All this shit's dead.
[592:23.90]You did this.
[592:25.82]Yeah, I know.
[592:37.70]I know.
[592:47.56]I know.
[592:48.11]I know I did it.
[592:51.73]Um.
[592:53.85]It's up here, right?
[592:55.37]No, down here.
[593:00.71]Can I go this way?
[593:02.41]Oh, I need a lockpick.
[593:06.95]Oh yeah, I remember this room.
[593:10.91]This room was fucked up.
[593:18.88]Everyone's freaking out.
[593:22.19]Explore thoroughly.
[593:23.15]Explore thoroughly.
[593:24.11]Explore thoroughly.
[593:25.31]In the end area.
[593:26.23]That's what I'm doing.
[593:28.79]I'm exploring.
[593:40.60]Ooh, what's this?
[593:42.02]What's the code?
[593:42.52]I don't know.
[593:50.47]Fabric?
[593:52.87]Why do I have that?
[593:53.49]1, 2, 3, 4.
[593:55.87]1, 2, 3, 4.
[593:56.61]Nah, I gotta go back this way.
[594:13.40]Wait, where am I?
[594:16.98]Is it not this way?
[594:20.26]That's the same code on my luggage.
[594:23.10]No gas in here.
[594:23.90]That's alright.
[594:24.52]I just need to look at it for a second.
[594:31.66]Is it not all the way down?
[594:38.32]Can I get in this?
[594:40.28]There's a chest in here.
[594:42.22]There's a chest in here.
[594:49.75]Not like it matters, but... I mean, like, pretty cool, I guess.
[594:57.22]It would have been great before.
[595:00.86]Wait, wait, wait.
[595:01.24]Can I go up?
[595:01.66]I don't think so.
[595:10.92]I don't care.
[595:16.50]I don't care.
[595:16.98]I don't care.
[595:30.81]Just go to bed.
[595:34.89]Okay, every time I come here, I get lost every time.
[595:39.37]It's the only place in the whole game that it's happened.
[595:43.07]Every time.
[595:44.41]It's the only place in the whole game where this has happened.
[595:49.04]I'm actually going to die here.
[595:50.22]No, I'm not.
[596:07.54]keep passing the way I need to go.
[596:09.14]It's through here.
[596:12.27]One goddamn sliver of fucking... One sliver.
[596:29.96]Ashes.
[596:34.04]Well, I'm bringing out the shotgun just in case something happens here.
[596:54.89]Okay.
[596:57.71]Can I get in the tree?
[596:58.71]Oh.
[597:29.21]Destroyed well.
[597:32.95]Only ashes remain.
[597:34.29]I was told to look at everything.
[597:42.52]Give me the light.
[598:12.38]Where the hell am I?
[598:13.22]Why am I in this house?
[598:44.28]Nothing else in the house.
[598:49.08]Did I miss a room or something?
[598:51.28]Before I leave, I was told to explore.
[598:54.16]Heavily.
[598:56.94]I think I'm just gonna go.
[599:23.06]Battery.
[599:29.12]Colorless goo sips from the craps in the asphalt.
[599:36.95]This is the road.
[599:38.53]I made it.
[599:38.87]I did it.
[599:43.09]It's the road.
[599:44.27]It's the road from the photo!
[599:46.17]I did it!
[599:46.69]I don't have a car, though.
[599:57.40]This is gonna suck.
[600:06.90]Two torches.
[600:08.43]And a sign.
[600:09.13]The crossed out sign reads, Darkwood.
[600:12.50]That's the name of the game.
[600:17.92]Skeleton.
[600:19.41]Oh shit.
[600:28.57]It's the crippled old man from the village.
[600:30.85]He's alive!
[600:34.16]He's alive!
[600:39.42]I just... I just nicked him!
[600:41.71]I just nicked him right here!
[601:05.94]He's fine.
[601:09.03]Should I talk to him?
[601:21.27]Will he make it?
[601:36.62]The road, the road.
[601:37.30]I know, I know.
[601:38.26]Finish the job.
[601:44.65]No.
[601:49.23]No.
[601:51.21]If you live with an axe to the head like that... I mean, like... Come on.
[601:56.54]Come on.
[602:09.92]This reminds me of Bloodborne.
[602:16.05]There, trap him.
[602:22.84]This doesn't work.
[602:25.00]Does it?
[602:26.68]No, it does not.
[602:28.02]Tell me it doesn't.
[602:56.40]Is he dead?
[603:12.50]Just kidding!
[603:30.76]No, no, use your scream to wake him up.
[603:34.56]Guys, I have to end the game.
[603:40.27]He beat you there.
[603:41.31]I beat him.
[603:42.87]I beat him there.
[603:45.99]He's dead.
[603:46.57]25 kilometers to nearest town.
[604:03.36]Imagine getting lost on a straight road.
[604:05.34]I'm not lost.
[604:06.20]I'm contemplating whether or not to throw a rock at that guy.
[604:08.92]There's a truck right here.
[604:33.23]I used my runner already.
[605:02.33]Kind of abruptly stopped.
[605:09.62]Epilogue.
[605:19.11]I don't have an inventory anymore.
[605:20.23]This is the next town.
[605:31.88]What's this town called?
[605:39.30]Shady trees?
[605:42.61]Look at me!
[605:43.81]Look at me!
[605:52.95]Obscure forest.
[606:06.28]Electricity.
[606:07.02]Interesting.
[606:14.11]That's the first actual, like, polls I've seen.
[606:16.01]That's interesting.
[606:34.02]It's a building.
[606:37.24]Houses?
[606:49.30]Quite an entrance.
[606:53.20]And they're gone.
[606:57.22]Who's going to eat the bread now?
[607:05.03]Like a city?
[607:33.93]neighbor my first floor neighbor good day good day to you first floor neighbor I live in like an apartment complex can I go in the building
[608:05.06]Hold on.
[608:17.36]Can I invite people to talk too?
[608:26.28]I feel like I'm going in circles.
[608:35.66]I think I am going in circles.
[608:42.77]This is my staircase.
[608:46.03]This is my bike.
[608:47.81]Weird that no one ever tried to steal it.
[608:50.11]Dupa.
[608:55.00]It's probably the work of that little punk from the third floor.
[609:00.64]Someone finally evicted them.
[609:09.81]Boss.
[609:13.65]Got any spare change?
[609:20.74]I don't.
[609:21.04]I need a key.
[609:37.41]Jeez, relax, man.
[609:40.67]Relax!
[609:46.31]Awaken my kid.
[609:49.22]Get the hell away.
[610:02.00]That was a kid?
[610:07.35]Stupid cow.
[610:20.11]This is freaking me out.
[610:21.08]It's too late for this.
[610:31.50]Pleased to see you, mister.
[610:32.44]I haven't seen you in a while.
[610:33.44]Let's check downstairs.
[610:35.95]I'm a little after this.
[610:39.45]This is just normal life.
[610:42.13]They're still green, even though I've never seen anyone tending to them.
[610:44.45]Maybe they feed on the discarded cigarette butts.
[610:55.88]I'll go downstairs.
[610:56.86]Can I go downstairs?
[610:59.26]I cannot go downstairs anymore.
[611:06.03]What about this?
[611:15.41]Ah!
[611:18.97]Elevator?
[611:20.35]Doesn't work as a... Oh.
[611:21.25]Oh.
[611:29.19]Apparently someone was too lazy to bring it down the stairs and throw it in the trash.
[611:34.95]Old rug.
[611:36.52]More flowers.
[611:37.18]They're still green even though I've never seen anyone tending to them.
[611:40.34]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[611:41.38]Okay.
[611:41.84]What about up here?
[611:48.78]Okay, this looks important.
[611:50.01]Let me just see if I can go over here.
[611:55.09]I cannot.
[612:03.79]What does it say?
[612:07.59]It's probably the work of the kids from the neighboring apartment block.
[612:11.10]Dupa.
[612:14.62]Door's blocked from the other side.
[612:31.71]Wash your face?
[612:32.41]Oh, I will.
[612:32.81]Go ahead and... This is not my apartment.
[612:46.70]Bike.
[612:47.64]The neighbor's bike.
[612:48.26]He could do something with it.
[612:49.02]He's been lying in the middle of the corridor ever since it broke the kickstand.
[612:56.94]Not my apartment.
[613:02.05]Not my apartment.
[613:11.52]Okay, that's apparently... Home sweet home.
[613:25.49]Home sweet home.
[613:28.50]Okay, this is my house.
[613:30.45]My wardrobe.
[613:32.01]It's my wardrobe!
[613:33.09]Take off your coat.
[613:33.89]Wait, what are you talking about?
[613:43.37]You need to explore... What?
[613:49.83]Take off my coat.
[614:04.69]Hey!
[614:07.39]Hey, it's Suzrik.
[614:09.41]Missed me?
[614:12.59]Pet dog.
[614:14.23]Good boy.
[614:20.70]Good boy.
[614:23.92]My TV set.
[614:24.98]The black and white Reuben in real luxury.
[614:26.96]Unfortunately, it's broken.
[614:40.31]Folding couch.
[614:43.34]I'm very tired.
[614:44.00]I prefer to lie down in a regular bed.
[614:45.66]I can just drag this.
[614:58.15]These roots are growing up from under the floor panels.
[615:07.07]It won't... I won't be able to tear the floor off with my bare hands.
[615:09.97]There should be some tools in the kitchen.
[615:18.26]Bedroom key.
[615:19.74]Fabric.
[615:21.76]And some fabric.
[615:24.16]Tools in the kitchen.
[615:27.01]Oh, where's the kitchen?
[615:27.65]It's the bathroom.
[615:34.95]Washing machine.
[615:35.81]The Frania washing machine spent two days in the queue to get it.
[615:38.71]I'm barely standing on my feet.
[615:42.40]I'll take a bath tomorrow.
[615:45.84]Did somebody knock at the door?
[615:54.11]Some note is lying on the table.
[615:59.61]I've made you some soup.
[616:01.11]Heat it up.
[616:08.85]Cupboard under the sink.
[616:10.92]Stove.
[616:12.04]The rusty old gas stove.
[616:13.16]There's still some soup in the pot.
[616:16.66]Don't turn that on.
[616:19.24]Cupboard under the sink.
[616:21.10]Large screwdriver.
[616:21.94]Here we go.
[616:24.57]Okay.
[616:26.01]Oh, it's emote only.
[616:28.93]It's emote only mode.
[616:30.13]That means that there's something going on here.
[616:33.17]To avoid spoilers.
[616:34.03]Oh, okay.
[616:34.43]That makes sense.
[616:35.93]Um, sure.
[616:36.73]Let's turn it on, I guess.
[616:39.05]The smell fills the entire kitchen.
[616:40.48]Cook.
[616:42.18]I grab the largest dish from the closet, under the sink, and pour myself a bowl.
[616:45.90]It's not much, but it's enough.
[616:46.86]I don't remember the last time I've even eaten a home dinner.
[616:52.96]It looks kind of good.
[616:56.32]That looks pretty good.
[617:02.77]Not bad.
[617:05.43]Okay, so I have a screwdriver now.
[617:09.74]Bathtub.
[617:10.74]What about toilet?
[617:11.60]Nothing else.
[617:12.30]Okay, so...
[617:28.43]Remove flooring.
[617:36.23]Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[617:48.62]Fold the rug.
[618:00.62]What the fuck is under here?
[618:36.06]These roots are growing out from under the floor panels.
[618:42.26]Are they going- Is there like a person under here?
[619:07.24]What the fuck?
[619:13.85]Why are there roots in this house?
[619:15.87]I thought I burnt the tree!
[619:19.58]Didn't I burn the tree?
[619:52.97]Should I water it?
[620:23.18]I think I got it all.
[620:31.21]Did I get it all?
[620:40.11]Wait.
[620:41.25]Search.
[620:41.81]No, drag.
[620:50.07]Okay, so I'm going to the bedroom.
[620:53.71]I just took up all the roots in my whole fucking house.
[621:24.17]I'm scared to go to bed This thing's under the bed It's my bed The white crumpled sheets look as if I've just woken up
[621:49.51]At last.
[621:50.85]I feel my sore legs buckling underneath me, my body becoming heavy and overlooking, overwhelmingly lethargic.
[621:55.97]It was a grueling journey.
[621:57.50]32 days of human torment.
[622:00.78]Look closer.
[622:02.46]Fighting off sleepiness with difficulty, I lean over the bed.
[622:04.46]The springs creak noisily under the weight of my hand.
[622:07.46]As I cast my glance on the light brown construction from plywood, I notice familiar features.
[622:13.85]They are elongated and arched.
[622:15.53]I can smell the fresh sheets and the pleasant warmth of the quilt.
[622:19.63]Look under the bed.
[622:24.13]I feel a gentle draught coming from the dark gap.
[622:28.17]Between the bed and the floor, reach under the bed.
[622:40.49]My fingertips brush a thin layer of dust, coldness, moisture.
[622:44.45]I'm touching something rough, but my arm is too short to catch it.
[622:47.91]I think I need to move the bed.
[622:51.60]Move the bed.
[623:04.73]What is it?
[623:05.27]Bugs?
[623:06.13]Rats?
[623:17.82]What the fuck is this?
[623:49.09]Sleeping man.
[623:49.85]The man is fast asleep.
[623:50.75]He's smiling.
[623:51.39]He's hugging his knees with skinny, dirty arms.
[623:54.15]Small flies is covering a black sore on his back.
[624:02.30]Old weathered clothes.
[624:10.65]The steep slope blocks the way ahead.
[624:12.27]There are some tunnels at its base.
[624:15.67]It's a meter-wide tunnel covered with a slimy membrane.
[624:19.05]Further inside I can see pulsating growths blocking the way ahead.
[624:22.50]I won't be able to pass through this way.
[624:32.14]My trousers, they're completely destroyed.
[624:42.99]Dirty clumped hair covered the woman's face.
[624:45.09]She's murmuring in her sleep, clutching a rag doll filled with straw.
[624:51.47]Now the moon has faded.
[624:56.48]The night is here.
[625:00.18]The sleep stole over my doll.
[625:04.78]So close.
[625:07.44]So close.
[625:08.80]Your eyes...
[625:14.56]Ugh.
[625:22.70]At the bottom of a huge valley, I feel the dry, dusty Earth pulsating into my feet.
[625:28.60]It hums something quietly in its sleep, swaying to the rhythm of a simple melody.
[625:34.18]I'll wake up.
[625:34.68]I figure he's dead asleep.
[625:36.22]I'm unable to wake him up.
[625:38.78]Shiny stone.
[625:44.64]Talking in its sleep, moving its hand as if caressing someone with affection.
[625:58.97]Shiny stone.
[626:06.19]What is going on here?
[626:06.95]I hear a faint whisper.
[626:08.35]Stasiuk, my little Stasiuk.
[626:09.93]Sleep, Stasiuk, sleep!
[626:12.64]The face is covered in mud and sticks that clutches a shiny stone.
[626:16.77]The figure is dead asleep.
[626:17.91]I can't wake them up.
[626:18.71]Looks like a skeleton coated in skin.
[626:31.55]He smiles wildly.
[626:34.46]The figure sleeps on a muddy ground, resting its head on the chest of a skeleton lying next to it.
[626:41.18]Everyone's sleeping.
[626:42.00]He clutches a muddy brass cross in both hands, repeating some incomprehensible words.
[626:47.16]The figure speaks to someone in its sleep, squeezing an old man's photo in its hand.
[627:02.67]The emaciated figure sleeps soundly, embracing the remains of a child.
[627:06.53]Another sleeping figure.
[627:18.98]Sleeping figure sleeping everyone's just sleeping sleeping sleeping sleeping sleeping their sleep They seem happy even though they're emaciated and dirty some of them like dead Sleeping all of them sleeping sleeping stone What is going on right now?
[627:38.29]Sleeping figure all of them stone
[627:41.88]Stone!
[627:42.30]Oh my god.
[628:00.42]This is morbid.
[628:04.22]Cross this way.
[628:11.43]Everyone just kind of dead or asleep.
[628:26.72]The Earth is covered with thick bundles of dry roots that creak onto my feet and old, broken trees.
[628:40.48]Alright, more skeletons.
[628:56.41]No, I just want your stone.
[628:57.61]Just give me your shining stone.
[629:01.25]I just want the shining stone.
[629:02.63]Just give me the stone.
[629:06.33]Give me the stone.
[629:07.51]Just give me the stone.
[629:08.31]I can't get it.
[629:19.04]Pleasant warmth washes over me.
[629:27.79]What are you doing?
[629:34.69]Being!
[629:36.31]The- the being!
[629:46.86]I'm standing in front of an enormous being, place hand on being.
[629:50.36]I feel an overwhelming soothing feeling of security and happiness.
[629:58.09]The vast valley at the bottom of which I stand curves upwards, closing over my head.
[630:05.43]The rust of distant trees turns into a single silent murmur.
[630:09.58]I feel I'm coming home, to my flat, to my room with a window and bed.
[630:31.49]I feel heat emanating from the being.
[630:33.01]I sense my pulse slowing down.
[630:35.36]A calmness.
[630:36.12]I want to rest.
[630:37.16]Come back home to my bed.
[630:38.54]I want to lie down to fall asleep.
[630:44.86]Pull the hand back.
[630:47.82]Pull the hand back.
[630:49.16]Pull the hand back.
[630:50.36]Pull the hand back.
[630:51.64]I don't want to do this.
[630:57.80]I don't wanna do it.
[630:58.56]I still, my hand pushes the beam away.
[631:00.60]The warmth that was emanating from it disappears, replaced by piercing coldness.
[631:06.68]I've beaten you.
[631:07.72]Alright, I'm outta here.
[631:22.45]It's the, it's the doctor!
[631:25.51]The doctor finally came.
[631:28.43]It's the doctor.
[631:28.89]He's fast asleep.
[631:32.21]You made it!
[631:33.27]Nice job.
[631:34.13]Nice work.
[631:50.76]Should I do this?
[631:51.82]What am I- What am I- Should I- Embarrass the being?
[631:55.24]Or do I leave the tree?
[632:02.27]Nay, nay, nay.
[632:04.27]Nay, nay, nay.
[632:09.35]Withdraw your hand.
[632:20.02]Withdraw my hand.
[632:24.24]Do I have a bullet or something?
[632:28.64]Can I kill it?
[632:31.97]How do I kill this?
[632:49.84]I need to make... I'm like a caveman.
[632:52.26]I can't make that.
[632:55.60]How do I make that?
[633:09.08]No, I can go around here.
[633:16.21]I love emote-only mode.
[633:17.37]It's fucking so much fun.
[633:18.53]Alright, I can go this way.
[633:30.19]Oh, shit.
[633:32.66]Wait.
[633:33.68]Massacre.
[633:36.08]The man mumbles in his sleep.
[633:37.16]He's emaciated and dirty, but his face is radiant and calm.
[633:39.78]He clutches a rusty object covered with old beads.
[633:42.94]Some weapon.
[633:47.54]Well, what do you got?
[633:49.62]The man is talking in his sleep.
[633:50.68]These are the only snippets of sentences, single words spoken gently and slowly.
[633:53.38]It's hard to find any meaning in them.
[633:58.14]Leave.
[633:58.72]Without opening his eyes, the man clumsily waves his hand at me, then covers his head with it and freezes.
[634:06.63]Give it to me.
[634:07.05]Give me that thing.
[634:10.08]Leave.
[634:10.96]The man waves his hand again.
[634:11.92]This time he grabs my arm.
[634:13.20]Without opening his eyes, he turns his head towards me.
[634:15.20]I recognize him.
[634:15.85]He's one of us.
[634:24.91]Give me that thing.
[634:26.31]Leave!
[634:26.61]Can you fucking hear me?
[634:27.53]I won't let you take her!
[634:29.64]The man clenches his teeth with the fury of a maniac.
[634:32.18]Saliva flows from his mouth.
[634:34.62]It's hurting her!
[634:35.46]You will tear her arms out!
[634:45.48]Don't!
[634:46.71]Leave her!
[634:47.27]No!
[634:55.51]Holy shit.
[635:06.78]Give her to me.
[635:13.54]What are you doing?
[635:14.58]That's four people, okay?
[635:21.03]That's four.
[635:23.53]I'll take the f-
[635:29.78]Fuck.
[635:30.98]Five, six, seven.
[635:37.77]Huge roots blocked the way.
[635:39.09]Even if I manage to climb them, everything is surrounded by a steep slope overgrown with thick roots.
[635:42.79]There's no way out.
[635:47.75]Oh, yeah?
[636:05.76]What are you doing?
[636:08.93]Coming to take out the trash.
[636:11.59]Now step back.
[636:13.37]Everybody get out of the way.
[636:16.15]I don't want to add a ninth and tenth person to this list.
[636:19.02]Once you get past ten people killed that might be innocent in a video game, you're a psycho.
[636:23.68]Just move.
[637:10.23]That's way more than 10!
[637:11.69]Alright, do I- can I get out?
[637:24.62]Leave!
[637:25.09]I'm just- I'm trying to leave!
[637:37.55]I can't leave!
[637:40.23]Am I a guest?
[638:36.68]There's too many!
[638:38.79]There's too-
[639:09.56]Okay, sprint.
[639:39.23]How do I skip the cutscene?
[639:50.52]That was crazy
[640:06.91]great fire consumed the woods for a couple days gradually claiming many of its inhabitants you're a sicko that's the first thing I saw
[640:34.89]The fire consumed the last road leading to the heart of the woods.
[640:44.49]The doctor, who did not wake up even as the flames came closer.
[640:49.63]The doctor made it all the way through.
[640:50.85]That's at least one NPC that got to live.
[640:54.75]The three outcasts wearing old rags and scrap, who, grief-stricken under the enormous, completely burnt tree, didn't even attempt to run.
[641:10.94]The elephant family who did not leave their house at the swamp even as the flames started consuming it.
[641:24.06]The chicken lady who set out into the woods in search for her sister and lost the way.
[641:35.61]But not everyone perished.
[641:36.95]I think I got the bad ending.
[641:38.47]I didn't get the true bad ending.
[641:42.75]Piotrek did not live to see the fire.
[641:45.75]Before the flames appeared, he rose above the treetops and his rocket made up scrap.
[641:49.97]As he looked through the small spaceship window, he smiled for the last time.
[641:53.27]The Milky Ways and stars looked so beautiful.
[641:55.95]Even now, when moving away at a huge speed, slight, he was exploded on the ground.
[642:09.46]Did he do it though?
[642:12.03]A large part of the villagers survived hiding from the fire in the vast barren clearings.
[642:16.89]When the fire went out, and the incomprehensible whispers and calls ceased forever, they saw incoming helicopters above the destroyed land.
[642:23.76]Uh, Piotrek made it.
[642:29.57]Yeah, alright.
[642:36.00]Huh.
[642:37.38]There it is.
[643:16.48]was a good game first impressions uh first impressions of the game this is good I think um I for my first impressions once I figure out the inventory management I think I'll start to give a better idea
[643:42.93]Because the stacks are weird.
[643:44.73]So some things don't stack.
[643:46.23]When I figured that out.
[643:47.07]I've only had like three or four items in my inventory so far.
[643:48.99]So I'm sure it'll get easier.
[643:55.59]Last impressions.
[643:56.29]This was a solid game.
[644:00.75]I feel like... At least for me.
[644:04.93]Chapter 2...
[644:07.17]This last, like, hour was great.
[644:09.59]But there was like a little tiny part of chapter two that I just... It was killing me.
[644:14.65]But... Sometimes you need some peanuts.
[644:29.22]And we're good.
[644:35.77]I wonder how much of that portion, that, like, 20 minute portion of chapter 2 that I was getting destroyed on and I was getting frustrated, I wonder if it's because I had, like, low protein brain.
[644:46.95]It's probably, it's probably pretty accurate.
[644:53.72]No, that was good.
[644:54.18]That was really good.
[644:56.42]I'm glad I got to finish the whole thing on stream.
[645:03.30]Thanks for watching.
[645:06.68]I will see you guys again on... Let's see.
[645:12.66]I have a couple things.
[645:13.66]Oh, by the way, I want to talk about the... I want to talk about the... Just really quick before you leave.
[645:20.32]But you can leave if you want.
[645:22.30]Halloween, there's going to be a special stream.
[645:25.96]Whether it's the 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, I'm not sure yet.
[645:28.88]We have to lock it in.
[645:30.18]There's going to be a secret slime channel in the Discord.
[645:34.47]And what's going to happen here is all you really need to know is on 31st, you're going to be able to slime me.
[645:42.28]Or maybe you won't.
[645:42.96]Maybe you will.
[645:44.50]But you're going to have a channel in the Discord to come up with actions for me that you think I'm going to do without me knowing.
[645:53.59]So, oh, scratch your nose.
[645:56.17]If I do that and it's part of the first round, it'll probably be about 10 rounds.
[646:00.57]It'll probably, well, it's hard for me to speak.
[646:07.25]I just have to search for words up here.
[646:10.66]But, uh, you guys have to come up with things that you think that I do, or that I will do, on camera, to dump a bucket of slime on my head.
[646:22.46]And also, at the same time, you are also gonna be up against some bullshit here too, because I'm gonna come up with shit that you can't do.
[646:31.36]And if you say it in the chat, you're gone.
[646:34.79]You're out for the rest of the game.
[646:38.27]It's happening on Halloween.
[646:41.45]Those of you that want a good indicator of exactly what this is, go watch an episode.
[646:48.77]Just even one snippet of Figure It Out from Nickelodeon back in the 90s.
[646:55.12]That secret slime action is kind of what this is inspired by.
[647:01.90]Oh, and I am going to win.
[647:05.07]Everybody in chat is worth one point.
[647:07.44]I start with like 10,000 points.
[647:10.12]Every time I get slimed, I get reduced by about 500 to 1,000 points.
[647:13.16]We're not trying to get those numbers correct.
[647:16.54]Every time somebody gets snapped, deleted from chat, you guys lose a point.
[647:21.39]So if 100 people say the thing that they're not supposed to say at the end of the round and found out that you said it, that's minus 100 points.
[647:27.83]Each person's worth one.
[647:30.26]How many buckets of slime is there going to be?
[647:33.42]We're gonna make, like, a big batch of just random easy slime.
[647:38.93]I wanna make, like, a slime that's not, like, dog shit for the environment.
[647:43.79]So, I'm gonna look into that.
[647:45.25]Try to find out, like, a good one that's not gonna be a problem.
[647:48.71]Because I know that a lot of slimes are just, like, absolute poison, right?
[647:56.43]So, I'll figure it out.
[648:00.15]That's one thing when I've looked up stuff about slime.
[648:02.35]Oh, you're making slime.
[648:03.47]Slime stuff.
[648:04.25]This stuff is like Styrofoam 5.0.
[648:08.53]So I don't really want to make just... I'd rather try to do something a little more eco-friendly.
[648:18.92]But that's what's going to happen.
[648:21.20]We'll talk about it some more, obviously, when I'm back and had some sleep.
[648:24.98]I will see you guys on Tuesday.
[648:27.68]So, 1, 2, 3, I'll see you Tuesday.
[648:33.03]We've beaten Darkwood.
[648:34.23]There are like two or three scary games.
[648:39.15]Some of them aren't even scary, but they're going to be here for Halloween.
[648:43.19]Look under your bed.
[648:43.93]Oh, I'm going to make sure there's no pulsating twigs under my bed.
[648:47.37]I'll make sure.
[648:49.13]But that was Darkwood.
[648:51.02]And that was my stream.
[648:52.68]Thanks.
[648:53.00]This is a long one.
[648:53.64]11 hours almost.
[648:55.28]Thanks everybody for staying.
[648:56.46]If you just... I mean, there's still a lot of people here at the very end.
[649:00.74]Thanks for putting up with my bullshit.
[649:03.97]You know, the last vegan.
[649:05.05]You know what I'm saying?
[649:09.49]And I will see you guys... Holy shit, does it work?
[649:14.67]Does this actually work?
[649:16.79]Maybe it does.
[649:22.76]Hold on, how much did... Why is there a countdown?
[649:34.34]This thing is so fucked up.
[649:40.21]Has this been counting down since yesterday?
[649:42.13]This has been running a sub train in the background for the whole stream and hadn't even been on.
[649:48.31]That's so funny.
[649:49.31]Just let it go.
[649:50.05]I'm just gonna leave it there.
[649:53.80]I'm going to spend these next few days, especially probably tomorrow, I'm going to figure this shit out and make sure it works.
[650:03.35]But let me see how many bits we have here.
[650:14.60]Here comes a top sub gifter.
[650:24.63]If someone doesn't gift a sub in the next 90 seconds, this channel's gonna get deleted.
[650:28.15]I don't know if that's how it works.
[650:35.05]Uh, we can do the bits.
[650:37.07]I'm gonna really just kind of go through them quickly, though.
[650:39.19]Because it is very, very, very late.
[650:43.19]Thank you to Marvash Magali for the 250.
[650:46.22]They showed the Halloween map with Jay Elbertson's thing.
[650:49.48]That's so awesome, by the way.
[650:51.02]I'm absolutely fucking floored.
[650:54.00]That...
[650:55.53]I have a banner on a TF2 map.
[650:57.93]That's awesome.
[651:10.78]Wait, what happened here?
[651:11.76]Oh, I'm stupid.
[651:12.57]I need to close this.
[651:17.33]And put on the music.
[651:20.07]There we go.
[651:23.23]But, yeah, if you weren't here earlier, in the new TF2 Halloween map, there's a reference to the Carnival stream.
[651:31.79]That's crazy.
[651:35.98]It's really cool.
[651:36.80]I'm probably gonna go check it out and see and just take a look at it.
[651:39.16]Yeah.
[651:42.92]Holy shit.
[651:44.46]Somebody did it!
[651:46.06]Somebody subscribed!
[651:48.87]Wait, did it reset?
[651:51.27]Oh, that's what that means, right?
[651:55.02]Hey, it's time for slime.
[651:55.70]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[651:57.64]My username will finally be relevant when this Halloween stream comes.
[652:02.14]Yeah, it's gonna be great.
[652:04.12]Also, thanks for your five community subs as well.
[652:07.08]Uh, Cyrus Dexter, thanks for the 265.
[652:11.28]Appreciate it.
[652:14.16]Thank you, Family Kidneys, for the 500 bits they saved.
[652:16.60]Free Hong Kong.
[652:22.02]What a pretty terminalistic
[652:25.03]world at the moment but yeah it's really odd to see just at least in my opinion when shit like this is going down germans can get banned
[652:54.53]Blizzard's gonna fire you.
[653:00.32]My senator was talking about it.
[653:02.48]Yeah, no, this shit is fucking really coming up to a head here.
[653:05.98]And hopefully... Hopefully this gets resolved.
[653:12.03]In the good way.
[653:13.71]You know, obviously... I'm a proponent of democracy.
[653:19.32]Very much so.
[653:19.90]I mean, I live in the United States.
[653:35.13]I live in Hong Kong, and it's very sad that this is happening.
[653:39.41]Yeah.
[653:43.19]But the thing is, when... I'll give you my just short 30-second blurb of this whole thing.
[653:52.44]I really don't know why Blizzard would take prize money from someone.
[653:59.44]Like, that's just... It just seems ridiculous.
[654:09.64]Like, I was talking... I forget who I was talking about this, but it's like, okay, if you ban somebody from a tournament, but they win the tournament, you know what I mean?
[654:17.75]Like, you didn't ban them from the tournament.
[654:19.55]You, like, just banned them from winning... You banned them from winning the tournament.
[654:27.57]It's like, oh, hey, I won some money on this tournament.
[654:31.88]You're banned from that tournament.
[654:33.06]Well, I already was in the tournament.
[654:35.30]Well, you... It's just shit.
[654:37.16]You're banned from it, though.
[654:40.87]That's like getting arrested.
[654:43.27]It's like a police officer asking you, son, have you ever smoked marijuana before in your life?
[654:49.07]It's like, yeah.
[654:50.64]You're under arrest.
[654:54.08]Did you smoke marijuana yesterday?
[654:55.38]Yeah.
[654:57.84]You have any on you right now?
[654:59.45]No.
[655:00.55]You're under arrest.
[655:01.77]What?
[655:07.23]But also, I'm also of the opinion that if, let's say if somebody is like a fan of Hearthstone, let's say somebody loves Hearthstone.
[655:16.34]There are way more people in Blizzard than just the top five people that make decisions.
[655:27.30]And it's a problem at the top, not a problem with the people that care about those games.
[655:42.97]So anytime somebody says, well, you stop supporting Blizzard, stop supporting Hearthstone, stop supporting Warcraft.
[655:51.04]There are people that have put their whole lives into those games, dedicated their whole lives.
[655:58.70]People that have built those worlds, you know, and they probably have the same feelings that a lot of people do.
[656:13.21]They still get paid for that?
[656:14.05]You're not hurting them?
[656:15.61]No, I know, but still, you just... You gotta remember that there's a lot of people, it's not just... It's not just you that feel this way.
[656:29.58]And there is an issue with essentially people running companies that decide everything for everybody else, kind of.
[656:44.80]Which, I mean, that's what happens when you run a company.
[656:47.98]Even if it means they're going to do something that's not seen as right or it's wrong or it's sensitive.
[656:59.19]But sometimes the bottom line is what matters to a lot of these companies.
[657:05.95]So it's a weird position.
[657:17.71]That was a long 30 seconds.
[657:25.75]It's like a full five minutes.
[657:27.92]But I do want to give... I mean, obviously... I'll tell you what's going to be... BlizzCon is going to be very interesting.
[657:38.10]Because... It's almost like they've... I don't know what the fuck they're going to do.
[657:49.77]What are they going to be like?
[657:50.61]Hey, everybody.
[657:51.43]Alright.
[657:53.15]Hey, here's Diablo 4.
[657:59.10]Right?
[657:59.58]Isn't that great?
[658:00.52]That's great, right?
[658:01.76]That's good shit, isn't it?
[658:03.30]Right?
[658:12.64]Most people are still going to go.
[658:16.30]Yeah, but think about that though, right?
[658:17.86]Like, imagine... That's in like two or three weeks.
[658:21.52]Imagine you already booked your hotel, you booked your flight.
[658:28.10]Like, it's okay to still enjoy things.
[658:35.73]But I severely disagree with all the stuff that the people at the top have decided to do.
[658:41.33]Severely.
[658:41.97]Completely.
[658:58.68]But we'll see.
[658:59.30]Maybe something will happen here.
[659:00.83]Maybe... Maybe, like, the head can get pulled out of the ass.
[659:05.40]And... Maybe we'll see some... Actually, something good come from this.
[659:09.72]I don't know.
[659:27.74]Did they put a statement out today?
[659:29.58]I'll have to read it after this, but... Yeah.
[659:36.67]Pull heads from ass.
[659:42.63]Ever like this music?
[659:43.37]It is very good.
[659:47.84]It was a garbage statement.
[659:49.60]It was a non-answer.
[659:54.07]Was it just like a... corporate... copy-paste... like Alexa wrote it?
[660:07.79]Yeah, that's unfortunate.
[660:21.34]But...
[660:23.54]We'll see what happens.
[660:28.69]We'll move on from that, though.
[660:33.55]Jerma, please say something extremely controversial.
[660:38.49]I don't think anything... I think most of the things I said are what a lot of people think.
[660:45.57]I'm not a very complicated person, guys.
[660:49.49]You know, I'm pretty... I kind of see things the way that they are, and that's kind of the way that it is.
[660:57.41]And that's it.
[661:02.80]He's a simple streamer, but he has bad taste in ice cream.
[661:07.88]And steak.
[661:18.28]I always see Blizzard ads when I load up your stream.
[661:23.85]Well, that's a Twitch thing, though.
[661:25.29]I mean, I make WoW references all the time, but you have to remember, I played... I don't play Blizzard games anymore.
[661:36.44]I don't.
[661:38.96]The last time I opened up Overwatch, I think, was like two years ago.
[661:43.02]I downloaded WoW Classic when it first came out.
[661:47.19]Got to level 7 and realized, holy shit, I don't want to do this again.
[661:51.19]It's like, wow.
[661:57.89]I remember what this was like.
[662:10.48]I still thought it was interesting, though.
[662:11.82]I still thought it was cool.
[662:14.48]But I... I kind of just don't have the time to do it anymore.
[662:18.91]To do that.
[662:24.44]But yeah, I... I'm not really... I don't really have a connection to Blizzard at all.
[662:38.58]But you said you play Hearthstone every night on your iPad.
[662:42.10]Maybe a while ago, maybe.
[662:43.12]Maybe one of the adventures came out, like, three, four, five months ago.
[662:48.85]I did.
[662:50.07]I played Hearthstone, yeah, like a few months ago, yeah.
[662:53.69]Not anymore.
[662:54.49]And before that, not for a while.
[663:02.85]We aren't 16 anymore.
[663:04.20]Feels fucked, man.
[663:05.36]What?
[663:05.50]What?
[663:07.83]But I'll move on from the kind of controversy that's going on in the gaming world.
[663:16.42]We'll move on, because it is getting late.
[663:23.76]He won't say Nevada.
[663:24.48]What are you talking about?
[663:25.46]Why wouldn't I say Nevada?
[663:29.94]But hopefully I've tried to articulate some of the things that I think.
[663:38.16]Hopefully I did.
[663:39.46]I have been streaming for 11 hours, so.
[663:44.80]But, here we go.
[663:46.44]Sad Vega, thanks for the $2.50.
[663:47.60]You know what?
[663:52.42]That full moon thing, how do you explain every other day of the month?
[663:55.35]I'll agree with you.
[663:57.25]You've been extra weird today.
[664:09.94]I have not been extra weird today.
[664:16.74]Hey Creamcorn, thanks for the five community subs.
[664:24.84]I wasn't extra weird today.
[664:27.50]I was just normal weird.
[664:36.78]I was.
[664:39.20]What do you mean?
[664:40.08]Because I did the cookie crisp?
[664:43.66]You killed an old man and laughed about it for 20 minutes.
[664:45.80]No, that wasn't what I was laughing at.
[664:47.68]I was laughing at everybody's extremely quick reaction to it.
[664:53.90]No, you have to understand.
[664:55.15]I saw like a bunch of random messages.
[665:00.71]That were just pushing me over the edge.
[665:14.50]Oh, God.
[665:16.86]That was fucking ridiculous.
[665:19.55]Because I just didn't understand the consequences of my actions.
[665:22.97]And everybody knew the consequences.
[665:30.70]He's still... Hey, he was crawling at the end of the movie.
[665:35.52]You saw him.
[665:44.75]Uh, this community fucking cracks me up every time.
[665:47.01]You guys are great.
[665:51.38]Uh, thank you Putrefacient Growclown for the 600 bits.
[665:58.30]How did anyone know that everyone left?
[666:00.92]The streamer still has zero viewers.
[666:02.46]There's still nobody watching this.
[666:11.23]It's a Twitch problem.
[666:14.86]Thank you Jack the Mac for the 500 bits.
[666:16.38]Hey Jerm, I've noticed you've been playing some pretty spooky games to get into the holiday spirit.
[666:19.91]You should check out Dusk on Steam.
[666:22.61]It's like old school Doom.
[666:24.23]I'm sure Chad would like it.
[666:32.34]I've heard of Dusk before.
[666:34.90]Seems like an interesting game.
[666:39.68]Thank you, Kohillen, for the 300 bits.
[666:42.10]Jerma, could you ask Jeff Bezos why he added RPG Ayaya as an official Twitch emote?
[666:48.89]What is it?
[667:00.85]It doesn't work.
[667:12.41]I'm doing it right.
[667:17.93]Oh.
[667:18.51]You have to unlock it.
[667:20.07]Oh.
[667:21.99]RPG.
[667:25.26]I don't know.
[667:26.14]I don't know Jeff Bezos.
[667:36.49]Bullshit.
[667:37.15]Bullshit.
[667:39.25]The only thing that I know about Jeff Bezos is he's bald.
[667:45.75]And he has like 400 billion dollars.
[667:57.52]We have something in common then.
[667:58.94]Yeah.
[668:05.64]Thank you, Shelbykun, for the thousand bits.
[668:08.15]Hey, Jerry, I just want to say that the fridge drawing I drew for you was a joke.
[668:12.47]I thought I needed to say this after your reaction, so I don't think you took it seriously.
[668:16.19]Fridge drawing?
[668:17.23]What?
[668:21.18]What's a fridge drawing?
[668:24.98]Don't ever take anything I say seriously.
[668:27.34]It's important to you to know.
[668:32.64]I'm a licensed comedy clown, so, I mean, 80 to 90% of the things I say are just licensed comedy clown material.
[668:43.91]They also say, I had a dream a couple nights ago.
[668:46.17]I dreamed that you were doing another Christmas dream.
[668:50.03]You had gotten a reindeer plush, and suddenly chat was flooded with messages adding me saying, it's you, and stuff like that.
[668:56.80]It was pretty cool.
[669:05.62]It's you.
[669:07.52]It's you.
[669:10.34]Click the link.
[669:11.06]Let's see.
[669:12.92]But thank you, Shelbykun, for the... way more than that, actually.
[669:16.41]Uh, there's 3,000 bits from Shelbykun.
[669:24.87]They say, Forgot to mention this cool thing I found out.
[669:26.51]Leon Kennedy from Resident Evil looks like the Quiet Man.
[669:29.19]I almost shit myself when I realized this.
[669:30.77]P.S.
[669:31.01]You're the goat.
[669:32.27]Love your streams, man.
[669:33.15]Always make me happy.
[669:34.25]Thanks, Shelby.
[669:38.19]And they also say one more thing.
[669:39.45]Maybe when someone told you to play Half-Life and you freaked out, is there a reason do you hate Half-Life or are you just scared of the immense backseating that'll happen?
[669:49.98]Um... No, I mean, I've just... I've played through Half-Life and Half-Life 2.
[669:59.38]So... It's not... I just don't have a reason to play it.
[670:04.71]And I don't hate Half-Life...
[670:09.33]streaming that's like that's my new favorite thing that you guys say because it can be used in so many places it really can
[670:41.34]Uh, no, I don't have a problem with the Half-Life, I just, I would love to play a new one.
[670:48.68]And they also say one last thing for 500 bits.
[670:49.78]Can you sing a song for me?
[670:50.60]One that's worth $35, however much I gave you, I lost count.
[670:53.04]Sing a song.
[670:53.54]Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
[671:08.77]That's the power of my voice.
[671:09.83]That's the power of Peanuts, actually.
[671:19.23]You did that joke already.
[671:22.07]Shh!
[671:22.63]Don't tell them!
[671:23.63]Don't tell anybody I reuse material all the fucking time!
[671:36.17]The power of Peanuts.
[671:37.89]Peanuts.
[671:42.76]You've done that joke probably five times.
[671:44.86]I've done that, okay, I've made that joke five times in ten years.
[671:51.15]What's the, what's the, the, the Half-Life?
[671:55.57]I'll give you a cool word there.
[671:57.51]What's the Half-Life on being able to tell a joke that maybe other people may not have heard before?
[672:01.71]I've done it five times in ten years.
[672:05.68]You guys act like I'm the guy at the bar that keeps telling the same joke every weekend.
[672:24.76]You do look at me.
[672:25.98]That's not a joke.
[672:27.60]That's an issue.
[672:28.68]Okay.
[672:42.63]Hey, CVFD.
[672:44.29]Thanks for the 250.
[672:45.34]Munch, munch.
[672:46.02]Good work.
[672:46.68]Thank you.
[672:48.81]C4G again, thanks for the 250.
[672:49.73]I saw in your previous bit messages that they added RPG Aya, and if I don't get it off these bits, I'm unsubscribing.
[672:56.24]I'm sorry.
[672:57.94]Great Lord Walden, thanks for the 1,000 bits, just the top two Jupiters.
[673:01.62]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[673:06.22]Appreciate it.
[673:07.30]Sad Vega, thanks for the 250.
[673:08.42]I've had beef tartare before.
[673:09.94]That's raw meat, and it was wonderful.
[673:14.03]I would not eat beef tartare.
[673:16.54]Not even Jeff Bezos could get me to eat that.
[673:18.58]And he's got a billion dollars worth of it.
[673:20.38]I'm sorry.
[673:28.23]Look at me.
[673:28.89]I have a look at me condition.
[673:42.46]It's 4 a.m.
[673:43.32]Wrap it up.
[673:55.54]The bar is closing.
[673:58.18]Alright, we're almost done.
[674:01.01]Thank you, Genie, for the 500 bits.
[674:03.27]You'll get 500 more if you can get another in your mouth.
[674:07.07]Also, play Divinity.
[674:14.66]You're talking about peanuts.
[674:24.06]There you go, I got another one.
[674:28.08]Sage the Ghost, thanks for a thousand bits.
[674:29.64]Thanks, buddy.
[674:30.44]Thanks to you, actually.
[674:31.98]Thank you.
[674:36.20]Let's put the credits on screen.
[674:38.86]I will see you guys on Tuesday.
[674:39.92]We've got a few more bits to do.
[674:45.83]Oh, the map creator was here.
[674:48.45]I'm the map creator for that.
[674:52.22]My partner and I are big fans.
[674:54.04]We even met you at PAX... We even met you a few PAXs ago.
[674:59.04]My partner made the Grandpa set for Scout, if you remember.
[675:04.88]Oh, shit!
[675:06.58]Wow.
[675:08.82]That's awesome.
[675:16.68]So, I can't... Sometimes I can't believe that people...
[675:23.65]You're not like, oh, I'm a fan of yours.
[675:28.21]It's like, I'm a fan of yours, man!
[675:29.79]Some of you guys are so fucking talented and are doing such interesting shit.
[675:36.50]That... You know, it goes both ways.
[675:48.06]Who's my fan?
[675:48.86]Me!
[675:50.70]Feels64.
[675:53.38]You got a new fan.
[675:55.42]Right now.
[676:05.11]Me too.
[676:05.49]And a bunch of others too.
[676:07.41]Look at all these new fans.
[676:11.95]But that's awesome.
[676:12.81]I'm absolutely floored that that's, like I said previously.
[676:17.57]I have to check the map out.
[676:18.53]I want to see what it looks like.
[676:22.20]boot up the old TF2 engine and just dick around for an hour.
[676:27.54]But that's awesome.
[676:28.60]Thank you again.
[676:31.52]Let's get the credits on screen.
[676:35.31]If I even can.
[676:38.15]It's been a while since I've gone more than 10-11 hours and it feels good sometimes.
[676:46.55]You know, sometimes you gotta have a long one.
[676:51.60]Thanks for the subs, everybody.
[676:54.08]I will leave you with these last few bits.
[676:55.42]We had Buff McSlabchest.
[676:58.96]Gave 2,000 bits.
[677:00.39]20 bucks.
[677:04.47]Been meaning to give you something for a while.
[677:06.47]Having fun.
[677:07.79]Yeah.
[677:13.88]Thank you for the $20.
[677:15.86]I'm having a blast.
[677:22.30]Somebody says, oh, there was help.
[677:51.23]Yeah, but I mean, I was alright.
[677:53.91]Playing a scary, horror, jumpy game that takes a lot of non-handholding for like nine, ten hours.
[678:02.81]My normal gaming sessions, even when I'm not on stream, even before I was streaming, were like four or five hours tops.
[678:10.93]So, but I had peanuts and I was good to go.
[678:16.26]They say, I forgive you for your boomer-ness.
[678:18.03]Thank you.
[678:19.43]Thank you.
[678:20.75]Those are rookie numbers.
[678:21.69]No, thanks a lot, Dubski.
[678:27.65]And then FutureGamer, thanks for the 250.
[678:29.27]As this channel grows, how do you think you will handle a regular everyday chat of 10,000 or 20,000 people?
[678:36.66]I do not think that will happen.
[678:45.93]I mean, I've had 10,000 and close to 20,000 before, but not every day.
[678:55.95]I'm not sure that'll happen.
[679:03.20]The amount of time it took, well, think about it, right?
[679:05.68]If you just go by, it's taken a long time to get here.
[679:09.68]I mean, I've been doing YouTube and streaming for almost 10 years.
[679:16.96]And there are a shitload of people that are even here now.
[679:23.78]So, I don't know.
[679:24.52]I can't predict that I'm going to have 20,000 concurrent viewers on this stream.
[679:28.60]I mean, you're talking about the top 20 channels on Twitch.
[679:36.18]Top 10.
[679:42.73]I don't know.
[679:43.73]The doors are open, but I'm
[679:49.59]Whatever happens, I'm comfortable.
[679:50.91]Whatever happens, happens.
[679:56.98]But how would I handle something like that?
[679:58.28]I just will.
[680:01.70]You know, you change a few rules.
[680:04.26]You make it a little different and try not to change anything really that much.
[680:13.82]I mean, going from 800 to 1,000 viewers, nothing really changed that much in regards to how I approached a stream.
[680:21.12]1,000 to 2,000, 2 to 3,000, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, 5 to 6.
[680:22.68]I approached my approaches the same.
[680:23.50]If I have 10,000 viewers or 1,000, I don't really change how I do anything.
[680:47.91]I don't know but I appreciate the 250 thank you we also had uh devakitty thanks for the five dollars here they said go back and check you missed my message pepe hands you're right it did and here it is sick streamer used to be wholesome and righteous and while we suspected things had gone array before it was not before the dark would stream that it became clear uh Jeremy shot a child point blank
[681:17.19]Only concerned with the backpack.
[681:18.43]Then he ate a grandma alive while her grandson was next door.
[681:21.69]And finally he chopped open the skull of an innocent old blind man.
[681:25.18]The streamer is truly fucked.
[681:26.62]MonkaS.
[681:26.98]What are you talking about?
[681:34.76]What do you mean?
[681:35.58]Who did I shoot?
[681:36.28]Okay, I ate the old lady.
[681:40.65]I hit the guy in the head with an axe.
[681:43.07]When did I shoot somebody point blank?
[681:45.71]When did I do that?
[681:48.43]The music- the musician.
[681:55.84]Oh, but the- oh.
[681:58.24]The villager guy.
[681:59.06]Yeah, that's a- that was a villager guy.
[682:00.88]You show the music kid in your hideout.
[682:05.22]Well, what the fuck was going on there?
[682:06.98]Okay, go back and watch that clip.
[682:08.85]It's like... Right at the end of a night.
[682:14.43]No, it was during a night, wasn't it?
[682:23.07]Just like broke down my door and started screaming at me with like hands up the air I mean like like he had like ten tendrils in the air and his hands were flying around and he's like there was this loud noise playing I'm gonna go back and watch that clip because that was in my house
[682:50.51]No NPC comes into your house besides the traitor.
[682:54.57]Why all of a sudden is he coming out of the ground?
[682:56.63]Like, why is- what's he doing there?
[683:07.20]It was a surprise.
[683:11.54]But, uh, I will see you guys on Tuesday.
[683:15.18]Thanks for hanging out for this long one.
[683:17.69]Because it has been a long one.
[683:23.64]It's a good one to go out on, though.
[683:24.82]I had a lot of fun.
[683:31.33]Am I going to play any more Kinect?
[683:32.47]I still have, like, four or five Kinect games.
[683:35.07]We might do just a fuckface stream in a few weeks or something.
[683:39.87]Just do a bunch of stuff that we haven't done.
[683:40.97]We'll see.
[683:49.96]But I'm gonna get some sleep.
[683:51.10]I'm gonna go, actually, I'm gonna take a shower first.
[683:52.82]I'll just kind of wash the, uh, the layer of gamer on my face off.
[684:05.19]Somebody just gave me a word.
[684:05.97]What did you say?
[684:06.91]Uh, unclean, unclean sepic.
[684:10.49]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[684:11.53]Can you still do this?
[684:12.53]No, I cannot.
[684:14.72]This is the 500 subs video of me curling 30 pound weights.
[684:19.65]No, I can't do this anymore.
[684:26.89]I used to be a strong, strong son of a gun.
[684:37.16]I couldn't even attempt to do one of these right now.
[684:42.26]When is this video uploaded?
[684:44.50]July 3rd, 2011.
[684:50.26]Bad form?
[684:51.60]Bad posture?
[684:52.32]What, are you kidding me?
[684:54.94]Are you kidding me?
[684:58.77]That's some of the best form I've ever seen a human do.
[685:10.95]Alright, goodnight guys.
[685:11.71]I'll see you Tuesday.
[685:16.51]Take care.
[685:20.21]Are we going to do more horror games when I go live next?
[685:22.49]Maybe.
[685:22.88]It depends.
[685:23.56]I have a few other things I'd like to do.
[685:25.58]I want to break it up a little bit.
[685:26.64]We've done four streams in a row here of scary, stressful stuff.
[685:40.14]And... Hold on a second.
[685:42.45]Is, um... It's late, but is... Is Tip of the Hat still on right now?
[685:55.87]Oh, it's rerunning right now.
[685:56.97]Okay.
[685:59.81]So I was gonna say we could... Yeah, I'll, um... I was gonna say raid the rerun, but... Can you do that?
[686:11.98]Can you, like, raid a rerunning channel?
[686:13.98]Does that work?
[686:19.01]When do they start up again?
[686:20.51]At 9 o'clock tomorrow?
[686:21.27]9 Eastern?
[686:23.19]Okay.
[686:23.77]Okay.
[686:26.79]Yeah, if you guys don't know, go support Tip of the Hats.
[686:29.73]We talked a little bit about TF2 earlier.
[686:34.28]But it's a great, great group of people.
[686:36.94]Awesome organization.
[686:37.80]I'm gonna link the channel here.
[686:41.78]That's where the original Jerma is short joke came from.
[686:53.27]Yeah, there we go.
[686:53.75]VRJosh has got it.
[686:56.29]Go support that.
[686:58.24]They do a lot of great stuff for kids.
[687:09.83]Yeah, I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[687:15.05]I'm gonna host them tomorrow.
[687:21.16]Star got sick, right?
[687:22.06]Yeah, that's unfortunate.
[687:25.84]Alright, guys.
[687:26.82]See you Tuesday.
[687:27.34]Goodbye.
[687:27.62]Good night.
[687:28.44]Take care.
