[01:08.82]Hi there.
[01:14.40]Welcome back to the channel.
[01:17.08]It's your Jerma.
[01:18.78]985.
[01:19.62]What?
[01:19.80]There are, as you see, before you.
[01:30.07]There are quite a few new emotes.
[01:33.77]There's quite a few new badges.
[01:37.15]And does the bit animation work?
[01:39.69]It does, but it's not perfect.
[01:41.31]I have to really work on that.
[01:45.18]That's going to be kind of finicky for a little while.
[01:47.14]So there are new bit animations.
[01:48.48]You just got to see one.
[01:50.52]There's going to be new sub stuff, new sub notifications.
[01:53.40]There's just shit going on.
[01:54.62]You know what I mean?
[01:57.38]There are all new bit animations, though.
[02:00.69]Wait, what?
[02:02.75]I'll be right back.
[02:04.52]Give me one second.
[02:06.86]I enjoy the intro for another minute while I tweet.
[02:20.15]Beer.
[03:03.01]Yeah.
[03:34.78]Okay, let's move over.
[03:39.20]So there's another emote that is not here yet.
[03:43.28]Hold on.
[03:48.57]Okay.
[03:50.51]So, enjoy the new emotes.
[03:51.93]Jerm of Fear is currently on the way.
[03:55.17]It might take a little while.
[03:56.33]Twitch is going to have to process Jerm of Fear.
[04:02.17]It's not quite ready.
[04:05.69]Where was I what the hell was the last thing I was doing?
[04:07.66]The Jerm of fear or if you're a regular in the Discord is currently the late streamer emote that's in the Discord It's it's just that face, but it takes a minute or two.
[04:21.52]Oh
[04:22.55]We've got a rat emote.
[04:24.42]We've got next emote.
[04:26.60]We've got all new animations.
[04:29.18]But Twitch cannot process the fear.
[04:34.70]I'm feeling okay.
[04:36.90]I'm good enough.
[04:37.60]I can go probably for at least a few hours tonight.
[04:39.24]So don't worry about that.
[04:42.60]Let's take a look at the charms.
[04:46.58]I know I want quick focus.
[04:49.32]That's just such a big deal.
[04:51.10]I used to... I get hit too much.
[04:52.54]I need to heal.
[04:52.98]What about a compass?
[05:00.02]Dash master.
[05:00.88]I really like having the... I'm such a fucking idiot.
[05:04.46]Like, I'm so dumb.
[05:07.26]That I feel like I really desperately need the compass.
[05:12.77]Just because.
[05:13.41]For now.
[05:14.49]While I'm still a moron.
[05:19.58]Someone's crying?
[05:20.22]No, somebody's laughing.
[05:21.14]We're gonna stick with this and I'll put on one of the other ones.
[05:24.98]I can do the mushroom thing.
[05:26.68]Is that the only other one that I have?
[05:29.39]How do you think?
[05:29.77]Does that look alright?
[05:30.97]Quick focus, the compass, and the sports room.
[05:39.84]Who makes your remotes?
[05:40.71]Oh, so if you're curious, the person that made all this stuff is Blordow.
[05:46.91]Same guy that made all the animations, same guy that did all the design.
[05:49.41]He pretty much does every single thing, design-wise, for this channel.
[05:54.22]So, twitch.tv/Blordow.
[06:00.88]Sports room is very important.
[06:04.97]If we could link Blordow's channel, that would be fantastic.
[06:07.73]His YouTube as well.
[06:08.57]He's an animator.
[06:10.87]He's a good buddy of mine.
[06:13.46]We've been working together on projects and on things for over a decade now.
[06:19.68]He's the one responsible for these new wonderful things.
[06:24.66]I'm trying to figure out where to go now.
[06:31.14]I'm really hoping that the Jerm of fear emote does actually come through in this stream.
[06:35.55]You know what I mean?
[06:40.43]Where the hell am I going?
[06:43.15]So... Fungal wastes?
[06:47.42]Is that where we left off?
[06:51.38]I'm going to assume that's where we left off.
[06:54.96]We need Glue Man.
[06:56.22]There is a Glue Man.
[06:57.71]There's a Glue Man emote, but there's also a Glue Man bit animation now.
[07:04.63]They're not really there yet.
[07:09.93]Here's the thing.
[07:10.29]With the new bit animations, there's four new animations that are going to play at various times, right?
[07:16.76]I need to put them in the right spots.
[07:18.64]I need to place them and do some audio work to them.
[07:22.03]But they are there.
[07:23.33]So if you want to see what they might look like, then you'll see eventually here.
[07:31.83]But those are currently live.
[07:33.75]And here's Glue Man.
[07:36.15]There's Gabe Degrossi.
[07:41.54]I wonder how much faster you heal.
[07:43.84]That is a lot faster.
[07:46.00]God, I'm not sure I'm ever going to be able to take that off.
[07:50.45]So, fungal wastes?
[07:51.83]Is that one of the... Let's check it.
[07:55.51]Fungal wastes, right?
[07:58.43]I could go to the spooky land, which is deep nest, or I could go over here to green path and go left.
[08:09.72]I'm not sure.
[08:12.50]Maybe I should go to green path and just go left and see if I can do anything over there.
[08:18.23]I think that's what I'm going to do.
[08:23.33]Yeah, I think so.
[08:27.67]Just left, left, left.
[08:28.75]Yeah, I was going to go left.
[08:39.61]I already got that.
[08:44.78]Is there a stag station that I'm missing?
[08:46.34]Where's the queen thing?
[08:47.16]I don't even remember.
[08:49.76]I have a coffee pot?
[08:53.49]What copypasta do I have?
[08:55.93]Since when?
[09:02.33]Why don't I check out Mystery Diners?
[09:06.88]How do I have a copypasta?
[09:09.98]Still no game sucks emote.
[09:11.32]Well, here's the reason why I don't have a game sucks emote.
[09:16.00]Because I feel like in other people's channels that could be abused.
[09:22.32]You know what I mean?
[09:23.04]If you go watch somebody stream a video game and you put, like, game sucks in their chat.
[09:30.32]They're gonna be like, what the fuck?
[09:31.92]What do you mean game sucks?
[09:32.96]No, I like this game.
[09:33.80]You suck.
[09:34.40]What's this emote?
[09:35.06]Who is this guy?
[09:35.72]And they're gonna come track me down.
[09:37.76]And, like, people will be mad at me.
[09:40.46]But then again, like, do I really care that much?
[09:42.20]Probably not, but... There's way worse emotes on Twitch.
[09:47.09]I know.
[09:48.11]I know.
[09:50.17]But still.
[09:51.31]You know what I mean?
[09:51.73]But still.
[09:55.33]That's the point.
[10:00.10]Okay, up all the way.
[10:02.16]The slug makes you happy?
[10:06.82]I love the slug emote.
[10:11.98]I mean, that's not to say I'll ever not do it.
[10:14.04]I mean, I still have, I think, four emote slots left to use.
[10:20.55]I think.
[10:20.83]Let's go this way.
[10:26.53]I believe I have four.
[10:30.57]Oh, here we go.
[10:30.91]Yeah, I couldn't go this way before.
[10:32.05]So we're near this.
[10:32.59]I remember coming over here and being like, oh, shit, I can't do this.
[10:35.21]Well, now I can.
[10:40.53]So what is over here?
[10:41.25]Oh, an auto.
[10:48.40]I could have an auto emote.
[10:49.56]I could.
[10:53.29]Why would this be here?
[10:54.07]There's nothing down here.
[10:56.62]What does the slug mean?
[10:57.68]That's me.
[10:58.10]That's a portrait.
[11:04.60]Look down.
[11:05.00]I know.
[11:05.22]I know how to look down.
[11:08.74]Oh, shit.
[11:09.32]Alright.
[11:11.04]This is new.
[11:15.50]First death of the night.
[11:16.22]I didn't die.
[11:16.64]That was not a death.
[11:22.69]Anything over here?
[11:25.30]Nope.
[11:31.24]Big one of these.
[11:33.24]I still have not figured out the purpose of that.
[11:35.60]Is it only just for that?
[11:38.92]I guess.
[11:42.70]Zap and late shot.
[11:43.68]There is a zap, actually.
[11:45.86]Zap just has to be processed.
[11:50.72]Zap and Jerm of Fear are the two that are like... Jerm of Fear is the important one, though.
[11:55.96]That's the one that I want here.
[12:02.32]Actually, keep me up here.
[12:03.93]Anything else that I didn't do over this way?
[12:10.95]I did it all.
[12:12.15]I did it all.
[12:12.75]We're gonna go that way.
[12:16.14]For real?
[12:16.58]Yeah.
[12:18.64]This is a zappy emote.
[12:25.91]Okay, this is interesting.
[12:28.79]I feel like this is a boss.
[12:30.48]You know, and I would be right.
[12:31.44]Yep, there we go.
[12:32.14]His boss.
[12:32.76]First boss of the night.
[12:38.72]Okay.
[12:40.18]What do you do?
[12:40.70]You spit shit everywhere and then you do that too?
[12:43.71]Alright, you do like a bunch of jumps.
[12:49.55]I'm trying to figure out this pattern.
[12:50.65]Oh lord.
[12:54.19]Oh my god.
[12:55.69]Okay, well, I'm instantly dead.
[13:04.49]Fuck, I have to really start all the way back here.
[13:08.51]Oh, there's a bench.
[13:09.21]I didn't... I didn't go to the bench.
[13:13.75]Well, I didn't know there was going to be a boss right there either, so I'm not blaming myself for that.
[13:18.83]But I do need to go sit on that bench that's up there.
[13:22.33]At the astral mound.
[13:24.23]So, chill for a little bit, alright?
[13:25.69]Let me just die to the boss that shoots spit everywhere and jumps around and insta-die, okay?
[13:29.79]Well, now I know what he does.
[13:33.87]First death.
[13:35.05]This is one of the harder bosses, is it really?
[13:36.60]I feel like once the pattern's down, you just kind of have to try not to get hit.
[13:43.40]It's like that with every game though, isn't it?
[13:51.66]Oh, hand.
[13:54.59]Need a frog emote?
[14:00.00]I actually do need a frog emote.
[14:01.16]I don't know what it would be though.
[14:13.81]Can you give us the... Oh, I'm like looking at chat.
[14:15.99]I was like walking to the right looking at chat.
[14:17.47]Remember this was a melon stream?
[14:24.08]Alright, I need to rest.
[14:25.96]So that... I'm probably gonna die, like, a couple more times to this guy.
[14:28.78]Because I'm gonna get to, like, phase two and then, like, phase three and die at, like, phase three.
[14:33.64]I'm gonna be very upset about it.
[14:37.27]I'm sure you'll hear it.
[14:42.53]Let me just sit here.
[14:45.21]What the hell is this?
[14:49.31]Why do they just stop?
[14:50.43]They're, like, looking at me now.
[14:57.12]What's the... What's the deal with these two?
[14:59.32]Oh, it's just hot springs.
[15:05.18]Okay.
[15:08.66]Where's the slime emote?
[15:11.42]It's the slug.
[15:12.02]The slug is the slime emote.
[15:14.22]They are one and the same.
[15:22.49]I might as well get this.
[15:24.21]Can I even attach to this wall?
[15:25.65]Why can I not grab this wall?
[15:28.61]Okay, well, whatever.
[15:39.76]Do it from the Amazing Frog video?
[15:42.50]I guess I could do that.
[15:43.28]Alright, so I'm gonna go up.
[15:51.50]Secret slime.
[15:53.54]Is it right here?
[15:54.34]Is there a... Is there a bench right here?
[16:00.78]Or is that like a different plane?
[16:02.15]Because I actually would rather be at this one.
[16:08.03]Or would I?
[16:08.41]How far away is this one?
[16:15.58]They're like the same distance.
[16:17.54]But I'll do this one.
[16:21.35]What about a Socks emote?
[16:22.81]Yeah.
[16:22.99]It's possible.
[16:27.99]Okay.
[16:32.87]Presto Majesto.
[16:33.77]Oh, there are... There's a possibility.
[16:35.39]The possibilities are endless.
[16:37.99]But these emotes I've wanted to have out for at least a couple months.
[16:43.19]I just never really pulled the trigger on it.
[16:46.37]I asked Glordal, like, a long time ago.
[16:49.81]I'm like, hey, you want to do, like, emotes?
[16:50.95]And he's like, yeah, definitely, man.
[16:52.87]And then, like, I didn't get back to him for, like, six months.
[16:58.63]And yes, the door cube is already an emote.
[17:00.91]It's a Tip of the Hats emote.
[17:04.82]So, if you want the door cube emote, then that's Tip of the Hats.
[17:10.28]You gotta subscribe to Tip of the Hats.
[17:14.82]That one is closer.
[17:15.62]Alright, let's go try this again.
[17:20.24]There.
[17:22.75]Do I still have a stomach ache?
[17:23.91]I do.
[17:25.53]But I don't think it'll hold me back that much tonight.
[17:29.17]I mean, it's obviously possible that it would, but I think I'll be okay.
[17:35.77]I plan to go for at least a few hours tonight.
[17:39.63]I'm gonna go down.
[17:40.19]Alright, here we go.
[17:43.61]Oh my god, what the fuck, really?
[17:45.63]Like I dodged that one.
[17:47.95]Oh my fucking lord, give me a break.
[17:52.32]Whatever.
[17:52.62]Let's try this again.
[18:03.11]Alright, let's get the hands moving.
[18:04.53]Let's take a drink.
[18:09.66]And here we go.
[18:10.88]Okay, I thought that was part of his intro animation.
[18:12.98]Apparently it's not.
[18:20.28]He jumps twice.
[18:20.90]When does he jump?
[18:33.19]Ayayay.
[18:41.16]Okay, I don't know what I just did to him.
[18:44.74]Damn, this guy's fucking hard.
[18:52.00]He can hit you with his hands, too.
[18:55.49]Wow.
[19:01.81]So there's one spot you can hide in.
[19:06.67]Come on, really?
[19:20.48]I'm better off probably jumping through that, by the way.
[19:22.68]Yeah, definitely.
[19:23.62]Yeah.
[19:29.54]Dolly shit.
[19:36.59]There we go.
[19:36.97]Yeah, that's what you got to do when you like queues up for it.
[19:52.63]What?
[19:53.33]What was that reach?
[19:59.03]Shit.
[20:06.64]Come on.
[20:07.34]Fuck that reach.
[20:08.02]That's bullshit.
[20:17.60]Speaking of reach, I might need it.
[20:42.50]Come on, heal.
[20:46.76]Got him.
[20:48.48]Got him, right?
[20:49.16]That's it, right?
[20:49.82]Come on.
[20:52.38]Yeah.
[20:53.06]I'll take a victory right there, baby.
[20:55.15]That was fucking hard.
[21:01.64]Did he drop anything?
[21:04.01]Yo, this guy's fucked.
[21:07.95]What is this?
[21:08.33]Oh, I got one of the four puzzle pieces.
[21:16.55]First try?
[21:17.19]No, that was second try.
[21:22.14]If I did not start to understand his pattern where you have to kind of dash through the super ooze, I feel like I would have died like ten times.
[21:34.09]Make a Jerma champ?
[21:35.13]Oh, I mean, jermaFear kind of is that.
[21:37.35]It'll be here soon.
[21:38.34]Don't worry, you'll see it.
[21:39.60]And you'll be like, oh, that's what it is.
[21:42.66]Okay.
[21:47.46]I guess we can keep going this way.
[21:50.54]Where's my treasure chest?
[21:53.84]What?
[21:55.40]Every boss, every boss encounter has a treasure chest.
[21:59.64]It's gotta be up here, right?
[22:01.25]Hidden in a fucking wall?
[22:05.89]Well, there's actually no treasure chest on that guy.
[22:09.99]How much was this game?
[22:10.87]It was not expensive.
[22:12.11]I think it was like $14.99.
[22:20.64]Extremely well priced.
[22:24.48]Okay, well, there's that boss down.
[22:26.94]I guess we just go where I was going to go.
[22:29.08]I was going to go to Greenpath, right?
[22:36.80]You'll know when Jerm of Fear is not pending anymore.
[22:40.28]You'll probably see it a thousand fucking times.
[22:43.16]I can't wait.
[22:47.81]Can't go that way.
[22:48.45]I'm gonna go all the way around again.
[22:50.05]Or do I?
[22:50.73]Yeah.
[22:51.85]I should.
[23:03.67]Let's see what this one does.
[23:05.95]Oh, it's like all gummy in his mouth.
[23:07.91]And then he goes... That was cool.
[23:12.31]That one needs to be a little bit bigger, though.
[23:15.13]That was cool.
[23:15.75]Thank you, Scallon.
[23:16.47]Let me see what it said.
[23:20.99]How much to have you sing to me on Easter?
[23:24.31]There's no price.
[23:28.29]Sometimes I just sing.
[23:30.39]But thank you, Scallon.
[23:33.99]Yeah, that was like an extra chewy one like see like if it's like 10 bucks, it's like chewy And it's too much for him.
[23:40.16]It's too much food.
[23:40.82]So he goes like Okay, now we're gonna go the right it's gonna go peruse That way Amazing logic
[24:07.85]It was amazing logic.
[24:11.78]Let's check green path.
[24:16.66]Yep, yep, yep.
[24:20.10]Turn him a clown emote.
[24:22.44]This still doesn't do anything right?
[24:23.60]No.
[24:26.72]Yeah, I mean, maybe I'll do like a clown face.
[24:28.90]I don't know.
[24:32.39]How much to have me come in a clown costume for Easter?
[24:37.96]Oh, no, how... What an Easter surprise.
[24:43.63]How much to have me come to your house in a clown costume?
[24:47.97]How much to have me come to your house in a clown costume?
[24:51.41]That's what I was saying.
[24:52.15]That was the words I was saying.
[24:54.05]Alright, we're gonna go top right or bottom left?
[24:58.60]We'll go top right first.
[25:07.84]Is there a bench?
[25:09.14]Yeah, we'll get that bench in the middle there.
[25:17.16]I do want that weapon upgrade.
[25:20.06]Ow!
[25:25.29]The traditional Easter clown.
[25:30.65]I wish it was the Easter clown.
[25:33.01]Easter would be so much more fun if it was a clown and not the Easter bunny.
[25:44.46]I'm getting texted here.
[25:48.42]I'm getting phone texts.
[25:52.30]The stream is already devolving and the new emotes haven't even been processed yet.
[26:01.03]Well, I figured at least today it would be a lot of people wanting to try them and use them.
[26:04.99]I guess this music is fantastic, so it's just left a million times.
[26:26.02]I'm getting ear texts.
[26:27.14]It's kind of like an earwig.
[26:30.34]Except it's a text.
[26:39.83]Next?
[26:41.49]Yeah, the next emote.
[26:43.27]Had to have one.
[26:43.81]This is where I want to be.
[26:45.89]I want the bench.
[26:49.02]Where is the bench?
[26:52.96]Down.
[26:58.24]Die!
[27:05.73]A toll machine with a symbol, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[27:10.59]I will pay the toll.
[27:18.48]Alright, down or up?
[27:25.03]Let's just go here.
[27:25.87]We're right here anyways, might as well, right?
[27:30.73]Almost, almost, almost, almost!
[27:41.17]When's my gonna scream for the sub sound?
[27:44.52]Um... Oh yeah, I forgot.
[27:47.28]That was supposed to be a sub zone.
[27:49.39]Now, can I make this?
[27:51.43]I remember I got stuck over here.
[27:52.37]I was like, I can't go here yet.
[27:54.81]If you were Spice Girl, what would your name be?
[28:00.29]Um... Ow.
[28:03.87]Ow, Spice.
[28:07.91]Yeah.
[28:08.57]Ouch, Spice.
[28:13.62]Ouchie spice.
[28:15.21]Can I get him to move?
[28:16.49]Oh.
[28:22.53]What the hell was that?
[28:24.29]Oh, that's my spore cloud.
[28:25.47]I don't think I can do this.
[28:28.07]Can I bounce on that?
[28:29.51]No.
[28:32.33]And I can't make it up here.
[28:35.16]So we can't go that way.
[28:36.24]But maybe we can go up or maybe we can go down.
[28:38.64]I guess we're going to go up first.
[28:41.52]Up and to the right.
[28:48.80]Let's see if we can do that.
[28:52.70]Yes.
[29:01.53]Go, go, go, go, go.
[29:04.16]Up right.
[29:04.54]Oh, he's gonna go up right.
[29:17.62]It's magnificent!
[29:20.32]It's magnificent!
[29:21.66]What am I doing?
[29:22.48]Calm down, dude.
[29:24.14]Calm down.
[29:29.32]Jerma Australia?
[29:30.46]What?
[29:33.38]Why would I have an Australia emote?
[29:37.05]You know what?
[29:37.67]If I get to, like, the, oh, this person can have, like, 50 emotes thing, then we are just gonna start doing countries.
[29:44.33]Or continents.
[29:46.40]And yes, if you're wondering, it's just gonna be that fucking face on a country.
[29:51.73]So there'll be like, Germany, USA, and it'll just be my face on USA.
[29:55.51]That's it.
[29:57.71]Or like, Germany, Asia.
[30:00.82]And it'll just be like the whole continent.
[30:02.24]It's just my face, and that's it.
[30:03.50]That's all you get.
[30:04.20]What the hell is even over here?
[30:09.58]What's the purpose of this?
[30:20.82]Germany, Canada.
[30:24.36]Gotta get, like, one real obscure country, too, though.
[30:26.90]People are just like, I wonder what his connection to that place is.
[30:29.44]It's like there is none.
[30:30.64]Just wanted it.
[30:38.16]Well, we got to a boss, and I beat it fairly quickly, immediately, so... I wonder what's over here.
[30:44.48]We still have two other areas to explore that I have not gone to.
[30:48.76]The kind of dark world...
[30:52.13]And something else.
[30:53.64]The other one that's on the left-hand side there.
[30:55.06]Okay, we don't... I don't have a map of this place.
[30:58.86]So, this is another new area.
[31:09.57]I wish we had Map Guy to help us out here.
[31:19.37]What the hell is a chest?
[31:22.20]Are you kidding me?
[31:26.34]Whoa!
[31:27.58]Whoa!
[31:28.82]Whoa!
[31:30.36]Hold on a second.
[31:31.80]Secret!
[31:33.95]Hey.
[31:35.47]Your boy just found a secret.
[31:36.79]Your guy just found a secret.
[31:42.01]You didn't think to go in the treasure chest, did you?
[31:44.35]I did.
[31:45.89]Get me on that fucking Wikipedia article and fucking- Hold on, calm down.
[31:48.33]I said that I did it, you know what I mean?
[31:51.95]Streamer finds.
[31:53.77]Huge secret.
[31:54.85]Not even The Binding of Isaac Reddit can deal with that.
[31:59.96]Like, people on The Binding of Isaac Reddit are gonna be like, holy shit, did you see what Jerma985 did?
[32:03.36]He went in the chest.
[32:04.32]None of us decided to do that.
[32:05.36]Okay.
[32:07.56]Okay.
[32:15.31]Ch-Chesire Secret.
[32:18.48]Well, I gotta be careful.
[32:19.16]I don't wanna die.
[32:21.12]Yeah, not even the developers knew this existed.
[32:24.02]Right now, one of the developers is watching right now, and he's like, got glasses, and he's like, wait, what?
[32:28.38]My glass is quick.
[32:31.76]Nope.
[32:32.28]Can't do the joke.
[32:37.78]Baldur's Shell.
[32:40.47]What are you?
[32:42.47]Protect its barrier with a hard shell while focusing.
[32:44.41]The shell is not indestructible and will shatter if it absorbs too much damage.
[32:50.32]Something tells me I desperately want to put this on.
[32:57.10]But anyways, thank you Magpie.
[32:58.75]Magpie.
[32:59.75]Is it Magpie or Magpie?
[33:01.53]I need to know because I see your name a lot.
[33:04.67]I'm going to assume it's Magpie.
[33:05.63]I don't know why.
[33:08.99]But thank you for the 10 bucks.
[33:12.36]And also thank you to Skullen for the 15.
[33:13.74]Anything else in here?
[33:22.52]Yeah, I'm going to write the game guide for this game.
[33:26.11]It's going to be one page and just going to be a giant picture of me dropping down.
[33:32.81]It's going to be a gigantic picture of me dropping down that treasure chest and like this and the right next to it is going to be this.
[33:39.28]So let me get your screenshot ready because this is like what it's going to be.
[33:44.41]So it's going to be like this.
[33:45.87]Get this in the right spot.
[33:47.51]Hold on a second.
[33:50.73]Hold on.
[33:52.63]Here's the game guide.
[33:53.53]Let's get that here.
[33:55.73]We need to make sure this is ready.
[33:58.67]Like this.
[33:59.11]Hold on.
[34:11.19]Get that ready to go.
[34:12.21]There's one right there.
[34:13.17]Hold on.
[34:16.25]Like, I did this.
[34:17.53]You know what I mean?
[34:18.01]So, ready?
[34:20.51]Get your screenshot ready.
[34:21.53]Like, this is the whole game guide.
[34:27.40]Okay.
[34:27.84]So, you need to have it be, like, dropping down.
[34:30.68]So, like, me!
[34:41.07]Turn off.
[34:41.57]What the fuck?
[34:46.76]That's all it's gonna say it's gonna point to the treasure like falling down and it's gonna say me and it's gonna be me pointing to me Okay, oh wait a minute what's this did you see that secret oh Wow, there's a secret NPC over here You hear this person, right?
[35:16.30]Oh, this is insane.
[35:16.98]Hey, get your second page for the guide ready.
[35:25.07]Yep.
[35:29.57]Look, there's another secret right there.
[35:30.74]Alright, so ready?
[35:34.78]Let's get this going.
[35:36.02]I need to be facing this direction.
[35:43.83]I did this!
[35:44.97]Yeah.
[35:47.59]This is your second page.
[35:48.45]I thought I almost just died.
[35:57.65]I almost just got clubbed by the fucking stalactite.
[36:07.09]Should I drop down there?
[36:07.86]There's a lot of random shit over here.
[36:12.86]Can't heal.
[36:14.12]I gotta be careful.
[36:17.66]This is such a bad joke.
[36:18.78]It's not- This is not a joke!
[36:19.76]I'm not making a joke.
[36:22.02]I'm stating that I did this.
[36:25.14]Hollowing- Hollowing cliffs.
[36:27.24]Oh, fuck.
[36:27.74]Okay, I gotta really be careful here.
[36:29.05]There we go.
[36:35.69]No maps.
[36:46.42]Oh, the Howling Fjord.
[36:53.05]Damn, I don't like this place.
[36:54.17]Too many platforms.
[37:00.41]Well, we found something.
[37:02.71]King's Idol.
[37:09.19]Relic.
[37:11.31]The elusive king was worshipped.
[37:12.68]I don't...
[37:15.86]There's a lot of those random items that I don't understand what they do.
[37:19.16]But I don't think we can go any further from here.
[37:21.71]At least not yet.
[37:28.01]I better hurry up and find a new secret.
[37:32.45]Oh, I need to find the map guy.
[37:33.73]Let's check up here.
[37:39.42]I hear like a twinkling.
[37:40.58]You guys hear that?
[37:44.16]I hear a ding-a-ling somewhere.
[37:48.76]What the hell is it?
[37:54.94]Hmm.
[37:57.34]Should I go up?
[38:02.50]Yeah, I'll try going up.
[38:04.56]Woo!
[38:06.54]Hey, thank you, TotallyRaging, for the $15.
[38:08.19]Appreciate it.
[38:12.07]I didn't see what you said.
[38:12.93]I'm sorry.
[38:14.15]I will look at it in a second.
[38:18.15]Just want to get to a safe spot.
[38:24.01]This zone is huge.
[38:25.45]Ah!
[38:26.93]I hear him.
[38:28.41]Where are you?
[38:31.29]He's right here somewhere.
[38:32.39]Come on, dude.
[38:32.99]Where are you?
[38:36.91]Above?
[38:37.28]He's definitely up and to the right.
[38:42.92]Well, hopefully I can get there.
[38:46.42]Yep, there he is.
[38:47.60]Hi there.
[38:50.81]This game is incredible.
[38:52.13]This game is very good.
[38:56.63]Thank you for the map.
[39:01.39]Wow, this place is big.
[39:02.94]This leads into Dirtmouth, huh?
[39:06.70]Interesting.
[39:10.94]Where does this lead into Dirtmouth?
[39:16.36]Dude, you got like Dark Souls levels of connected world here.
[39:26.31]Satan face, what?
[39:30.35]Let's just see how this connects to Dirtmouth.
[39:33.19]I'm curious.
[39:34.81]I'm a curious little bee.
[39:35.87]Alright, so Raging, thank you Raging, totally Raging, for the $15.
[39:40.07]Says, hey Jerma, thanks for all the quality streams.
[39:42.35]Can we get a beer in an Australian accent?

[39:48.87]Yeah.
[39:49.29]Yeah.
[39:50.29]How does the Australian say yeah?
[39:52.27]Yeah.
[39:52.83]Right?
[39:52.99]They just say yeah.
[39:56.22]Yeah.
[39:57.66]Yeah.
[39:59.78]Yeah.
[40:00.58]Yeah.
[40:01.92]That's as close as you're going to get.
[40:05.12]You're going to get a yeah.
[40:07.04]What are you?
[40:08.20]Here lies Gorb, the great mind.
[40:11.57]Oh.
[40:12.47]Sorry, Gorb.
[40:24.95]Secret!
[40:35.22]Damn.
[40:37.54]Damn.
[40:38.30]There's like so much shit.
[40:39.78]There's so many random little areas in this game.
[40:41.66]There's so much to this game.
[40:42.90]It's fucking crazy.
[40:43.88]Like, what is this?
[40:46.75]A bench, I guess?
[40:49.25]Okay, well, I guess let's just keep going.
[40:57.73]Hey, Curly Snail, thank you for the two bucks.
[41:00.79]Appreciate it, Curly.
[41:02.21]Uh, Hydra.
[41:04.47]Hydra Hydraulic, thank you for the five dollars.
[41:07.50]They say, kiss me, Jerma.
[41:08.98]I'm Irish.
[41:10.50]Well.
[41:12.26]Oh, boy.
[41:15.32]This kind of looks like a boss.
[41:19.49]Nail Master!
[41:21.67]Nice.
[41:22.77]Nice.
[41:25.39]I, Nailmaster Mato, who was taught the art of the nail by the great Nail Sage himself, hereby accept you as my pupil.
[41:30.05]Let us begin the lesson immediately.
[41:32.27]Learn the master's nail art.
[41:34.39]Yes.
[41:43.34]Hell yeah.
[41:44.72]I mastered the cyclone slash.
[41:49.37]So, I get a Mega Man swing now?
[41:55.63]Cool.
[42:01.83]You're my child.
[42:05.02]Thank you.
[42:06.20]Alright, let's see.
[42:14.64]Oh, damn.
[42:15.36]So I can go up or down with that?
[42:18.82]Maybe I can destroy the... Um...
[42:25.69]What was it trying to tell me?
[42:26.43]If I hold up or down?
[42:32.92]Well, thanks for teaching me that.
[42:36.80]That'll help.
[42:42.02]Nice.
[42:48.60]Dark Souls weapon art.
[42:52.33]Pointing up or down doesn't actually do anything to it right now, really.
[42:57.72]Seems a little odd.
[42:59.52]Is that, like, a bug or not, like, in the game yet or something?
[43:01.74]Is it, like, patching it in?
[43:08.83]Wait a minute.
[43:09.57]Did you just see that?
[43:12.65]I can, like, float with this.
[43:13.85]Hold on.
[43:14.47]That's important.
[43:19.89]I'm not crazy, right?
[43:21.33]Okay, I kind of can float with it, but...
[43:29.48]Um... I don't know.
[43:37.30]Whatever.
[43:38.64]Okay.
[43:38.92]Well, we got that.
[43:43.48]Let's test it.
[43:47.09]Cool.
[43:54.41]Let's just get this... Whatever door is open here for Dirt Mouth.
[44:02.11]Oh.
[44:03.49]Huh?
[44:11.67]What?
[44:16.29]King's Pass.
[44:16.99]Float!
[44:17.47]Float!
[44:18.25]Float!
[44:19.25]Float!
[44:23.04]What?
[44:28.56]Can I... Secret.
[44:45.95]There's page three.
[44:47.91]There's page three.
[44:48.87]Ah!
[44:53.17]Alright, slow it down, slow it down, slow it down.
[45:00.09]Slow it down, I said.
[45:01.11]Pretty sick game guide so far.
[45:07.09]We got three pages.
[45:13.18]Where does this bring me?
[45:16.12]Okay, so that's how you get back up here.
[45:18.22]Got it.
[45:21.01]This is just the Karazhan stream again.
[45:23.31]No, here's the difference.
[45:24.45]The Karazhan stream was fucking awful.
[45:26.69]There.
[45:27.11]There's your difference.
[45:31.00]The Karazhan stream was like the worst experience of my whole life.
[45:36.18]Alright, let's go explore over here.
[45:40.60]I feel like there's a platform I can jump to.
[45:45.36]Now we've got three pages.
[45:46.28]Somebody please keep track of the amount of pages that are in my game guide, please.
[45:51.42]That's three.
[45:52.76]We have to fill out the whole book.
[45:54.42]Of like eight pages.
[46:01.56]There we are.
[46:02.10]Let's keep going.
[46:09.06]Alright.
[46:11.08]Left.
[46:11.48]We need to see if there's a... I'm going to assume we can just keep going left.
[46:15.19]It's probably like platforms to jump on.
[46:16.71]But we're just exploring.
[46:18.21]That's all we're doing.
[46:19.89]Oh.
[46:20.25]Yeah.
[46:37.04]Okay, so let's try that again.
[46:39.40]Only this time.
[46:41.06]See, I had to get all the coins.
[46:42.00]That's why I did that.
[46:45.66]No Jerm of fear yet.
[46:46.64]What the fuck?
[47:00.34]I need to, like, climb this again.
[47:01.68]I get these dumb bugs out of here.
[47:03.24]These things are not even fun.
[47:04.46]They're just annoying.
[47:11.20]Can I get there from here?
[47:16.59]See, here.
[47:17.49]I wanted to go over here because I wanted to... I guess there's nothing over there.
[47:23.37]I guess there really isn't anything over here except for like that.
[47:25.47]There's one spot in the middle here.
[47:30.77]But didn't I already do this?
[47:34.46]Why is it not updated on the map?
[47:36.98]That's where the map guy is.
[47:39.81]Unless there was a spot I could walk to the right.
[47:43.09]There was, okay.
[47:46.68]Ah, shit.
[47:48.56]Not this shit.
[47:55.56]I definitely need some kind of item to even think about doing what I'm doing right now.
[48:00.10]We're going for it, though.
[48:02.59]How am I supposed to write a fucking game guide if I can't even do this shit in the dark, you know what I mean?
[48:08.29]Good, I made it.
[48:13.71]Okay, what's next?
[48:14.19]I don't even know!
[48:15.15]I don't even know.
[48:18.03]No, bye.
[48:18.51]Okay, can't do that.
[48:23.00]Cannot go over there yet.
[48:32.58]Well, I guess we're just gonna go... Let me take a look at the bigger map.
[48:39.54]We are over here.
[48:48.68]Did I try going all the way down to the lower left yet?
[48:51.48]I don't think I did.
[48:53.44]We'll do that.
[48:55.54]I wish there was a fucking stag over here.
[48:57.20]Alright, we're gonna go to Dirtmouth.
[48:59.12]We're gonna take the stag to green path and we're gonna go down again.
[49:03.13]Okay, that sounds like a plan.
[49:04.37]Let's do that.
[49:12.01]What is he humming?
[49:14.03]Something, some kind of song.
[49:17.38]Classic or something.
[49:20.42]Worst zone, you already got the one thing it's good for.
[49:22.68]Really?
[49:23.66]Okay, well.
[49:25.06]That's good to know.
[49:35.13]I'm assuming that's like an old one, boss.
[49:36.93]Who knows?
[49:37.55]I didn't look in here, did I?
[49:38.79]Yeah, I did.
[49:39.25]Of course I did.
[49:40.23]Come on.
[49:40.95]Of course I did this.
[49:48.23]I do like the range on that spore thing, though.
[49:51.11]It actually is very helpful.
[49:52.10]This brings us to King's Pass.
[50:05.81]Kind of going the long way, but, you know, I'm already doing it, so why not?
[50:18.44]Just want to get to the stag station.
[50:19.85]Yeah, I went the long way.
[50:25.95]Yep, I did.
[50:26.85]Whoa.
[50:31.37]Wait, what?
[50:33.75]Oh, I'm like back in the tutorial zone.
[50:35.57]How the fuck did I end up here?
[50:38.19]Oh, god damn it.
[50:39.20]Like, I went like a different fucking way.
[50:47.73]No, God, please, just please.
[50:50.79]Please, I just want to go.
[50:51.91]I just want to get out of here.
[50:53.07]I don't fucking care what the thing has to say.
[50:58.96]This is where I want to go.
[51:03.24]There we are.
[51:09.32]Finally.
[51:10.34]Okay.
[51:14.11]What is this?
[51:14.49]And why did this open?
[51:19.73]I know we meet again.
[51:20.33]How do you like my cozy little store?
[51:24.93]Several items.
[51:31.22]Don't I need these?
[51:34.36]Soul vessel.
[51:38.44]Simple key.
[51:42.82]Gathering swarm.
[51:44.35]Make sure that any loose change... This is just a magnet.
[51:46.95]A money magnet.
[51:50.36]Notch costs?
[51:58.40]So, faster hit recovery?
[52:02.12]Oh, there's the lantern.
[52:03.60]Oh, God.
[52:06.85]And there's a rancid egg.
[52:12.81]Well, we don't have enough.
[52:13.55]I need this.
[52:13.85]1800.
[52:13.87]Are you shitting me?
[52:23.81]I buy this.
[52:24.51]It's just one of those fragments, right?
[52:27.71]I'm just gonna buy this.
[52:30.11]What's the point of not having that?
[52:31.01]It's just gonna... Okay.
[52:34.06]Why not?
[52:35.36]And then two more and I finally get to get my Alienware.
[52:39.82]Get the key.
[52:40.58]Okay, the next thing is... I'm going for the key and I'm going for the lantern.
[52:44.29]So we just need cash.
[52:45.55]That's fine.
[52:54.73]Um... Anything else?
[52:56.57]Anything new in here?
[52:57.15]Or did I buy this whole place up?
[53:02.43]Yeah, that's fine.
[53:03.09]I pretty much bought the whole store up.
[53:06.53]Go get the egg?
[53:10.66]Get money from the bank?
[53:11.34]Yeah, I don't think I would have enough.
[53:14.82]I missed the egg.
[53:15.32]I can get it.
[53:15.92]It's 60 bucks.
[53:16.56]Who cares?
[53:16.94]I'll just get it.
[53:20.50]60 bucks.
[53:20.76]Fine.
[53:22.24]I'll take the egg.
[53:24.86]I don't know what it does, but I'll own it.
[53:26.60]Fine.
[53:32.66]Uh, starboard shell.
[53:36.40]Alright, well, I don't have enough.
[53:38.00]No, I didn't even go to the bank, did I?
[53:39.60]Didn't I spend all that bank money that I would have deposited?
[53:42.28]I'm pretty sure I did it.
[53:44.03]I spent it all.
[53:46.59]Alright, stag station.
[53:47.45]Uh, it's right here, right?
[53:55.28]Let's go Gathering swarm will help farm money Yeah, I don't have enough for it though So I wanted to go to green path and go down Eat the egg?
[54:17.43]Eat it?
[54:17.68]Why would I eat that right now?
[54:23.81]Isn't that not a great idea?
[54:25.01]Don't I need it for something?
[54:28.35]Generally not considered edible.
[54:30.41]I can't eat it.
[54:32.99]Just a rotten egg.
[54:34.85]Let's try this.
[54:42.58]So I need to go Fog Canyon or all the way down into the left.
[54:49.25]So we're just going to go all the way down to the left.
[54:51.09]I don't think I did that yet.
[54:52.19]And if not, then we just go to Fog Canyon.
[54:54.47]Because I didn't complete Fog Canyon, did I?
[54:56.91]I'm pretty sure I did not.
[55:04.02]Not necessarily going for like a hundred percent completion here, but I am already mildly intrigued.
[55:11.82]Down left is a dead end.
[55:13.88]Well, then I guess we're gonna go... We're gonna drop down.
[55:18.71]Fog Canyon is... Is Fog Canyon the dark place?
[55:24.77]It's either Deepnest or Fog Canyon.
[55:28.78]It's really like my two options at the moment.
[55:36.61]Fog Canyon, I think, is the dark place.
[55:38.37]I just need money.
[55:43.06]Eat an egg on stream.
[55:49.78]I did that already.
[55:50.48]I ate like a dozen eggs on stream.
[55:54.92]Let me just take a look again.
[56:01.29]Can I see the bigger map?
[56:02.73]What's going on here?
[56:07.08]Come on, open up the map.
[56:09.04]I'm like double tapping.
[56:09.92]It's not doing anything.
[56:10.66]Okay, here we go.
[56:14.18]Oh, there is the fungal wastes.
[56:16.56]Because I see the right, I didn't go all the way to the right.
[56:23.54]Uh... Yeah, I'm going to the queen station.
[56:26.57]Fuck this.
[56:28.99]That place is dark.
[56:30.97]I did not even fight the boss in the fungal wastes, so... That's where we're going.
[56:35.57]That's the plan.
[56:39.28]Sounds like a pretty good plan to me.
[56:42.72]Eat a dozen manwiches on stream?
[56:44.20]I would.
[56:47.04]You know I would.
[56:49.91]You think I'd eat a dozen manwiches on stream?
[56:54.03]What?
[57:04.38]Let's go there.
[57:06.06]See if I can do that.
[57:08.67]The Mantis Lords were the Fungal Waste boss?
[57:11.19]Really?
[57:13.65]So what's all the way to the end to the right?
[57:14.87]I missed a room.
[57:23.44]You can see Fungal Waste, right?
[57:26.46]What's to the right?
[57:27.70]I haven't gone over there yet?
[57:28.84]Can I go that way?
[57:29.84]Is it connected to a new area?
[57:30.96]Okay.
[57:38.58]I don't... I didn't go that way.
[57:46.95]I don't think I ever, like, decided to walk by there.
[57:50.01]We'll give it a go.
[57:51.43]We'll give it a look.
[57:51.95]I just need to go top right.
[57:59.48]Yeah.
[57:59.64]You gotta explore.
[58:02.72]Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[58:04.98]Hey, look, I'm in no rush.
[58:05.86]I'm just trying to take the whole game in, you know?
[58:16.93]It's Deepnest.
[58:21.47]I guess, right?
[58:25.42]So, am I going to the right, or am I going to the left?
[58:28.10]Down left, down to Deepnest.
[58:31.96]Deepnest was spooky, though.
[58:33.74]I'm not sure I'm into spooky right now.
[58:36.86]Oh, well.
[58:37.58]Let's see what's over there.
[58:39.06]Gotta explore.
[58:39.86]I have no Wikipedia page open.
[58:42.67]You know what I mean?
[58:43.86]I got no wiki article.
[58:45.52]I just got me.
[58:46.94]And you guys.
[58:47.44]Actually, I just want to go this way, right?
[58:59.15]Yeah.
[59:07.53]And then... Yep, up and around.
[59:12.76]Get out of the way.
[59:13.30]I'm trying to fucking explore.
[59:14.52]I will be your wiki.
[59:26.97]And here we go.
[59:28.66]This way.
[59:37.29]Yep, yep, yep.
[59:38.71]Okay, well, I couldn't do this before, but now I can because I have the jump, the wall jump.
[59:49.41]Hmm.
[59:50.65]This is gonna be a little tricky.
[59:53.39]Not that I can't handle.
[59:55.45]Can't do that, though.
[59:56.29]Yeah, I can, but let's see what's up here.
[59:58.63]Secret!
[60:01.54]Nah, that's not even a secret.
[60:03.14]I don't care.
[60:03.50]That doesn't count as a secret.
[60:05.26]There's no... We don't need a page for this one.
[60:10.08]Okay, well, there we go.
[60:12.36]Hey, thanks.
[60:12.92]At least I don't have to do that again.
[60:17.10]No, what does it say?
[60:21.70]Whatever.
[60:27.18]Click.
[60:27.76]Now we gotta go this way.
[60:36.82]Easy enough.
[60:37.38]Is there another switch?
[60:38.10]There is.
[60:41.90]Oh, you got me right in my guts.
[60:44.88]Inspect.
[60:46.22]A large knight statue.
[60:47.00]There's a socket on its chest.
[60:48.08]Insert the city crest.
[60:50.78]Yes.
[60:55.71]Ooh, it worked.
[61:02.87]Hey!
[61:05.52]Oh, wait a minute.
[61:12.19]Wait a minute.
[61:15.93]Oh, it's just one of these.
[61:17.61]Come on.
[61:20.13]Is this on the Switch?
[61:21.11]No.
[61:22.33]Although, I don't know.
[61:22.89]It might be.
[61:23.25]I just have it on Steam.
[61:30.13]Okay.
[61:32.50]New area.
[61:35.66]Maybe not me.
[61:36.42]Doi!
[61:40.80]That was a doy.
[61:41.64]I got doyed right there.
[61:42.90]So, gotta be aware of that.
[61:46.28]I just got slowly doyed.
[61:51.83]Let's drive a sacred.
[61:52.75]Let's drive a sacred.
[61:55.47]New emote.
[62:00.53]I hear like a gorilla.
[62:05.07]Whoa.
[62:05.63]Okay.
[62:06.07]Hi.
[62:09.94]Is that all you do?
[62:10.56]Do you do anything else?
[62:12.42]Do you have another move?
[62:13.46]I guess not.
[62:18.49]Those things are so annoying.
[62:23.73]I'm going to go down.
[62:24.49]Might as well.
[62:32.32]How many nail upgrades do I have?
[62:33.66]I have this one.
[62:35.08]That's all I have.
[62:45.89]Just one nail upgrade so far.
[62:51.25]This looks elaborate.
[62:57.06]Let's try it on this guy.
[63:00.26]Okay, well that fucked him up big time.
[63:01.88]Alright, gotta use that more often.
[63:06.72]No, I can't even leave.
[63:15.76]Okay.
[63:20.64]The great gates have been sealed.
[63:21.70]None shall enter.
[63:22.40]None shall leave.
[63:26.44]Whatever you say.
[63:28.63]Oh!
[63:28.77]What the fuck?
[63:32.75]I feel like these hurt me in real life.
[63:39.67]I'm getting actually injured by these.
[63:41.09]Oh, there he is again.
[63:46.60]Now it wouldn't be a stream if I didn't do this one
[64:12.30]Yeah, it wouldn't be a stream if I didn't do this one.
[64:14.50]Carl Peterschmidt and Ralph the Dog.
[64:16.20]You know, it wouldn't be one of those.
[64:17.22]Oh, you can clash.
[64:30.16]Sombra.
[64:31.38]Yeah, very Sombra.
[64:32.34]Oh, yeah, very Sombra.
[64:34.83]Sombra the Dog.
[64:41.19]Get out of the fucking way!
[64:43.01]What does this thing do?
[64:44.65]Secret!
[64:45.51]It's like a super chest.
[64:52.55]You sound better.
[64:53.17]How are you feeling?
[64:53.81]I feel okay.
[64:58.02]What's the term?
[64:58.50]You know... I've been better.
[65:01.78]But... I've also been worse, too.
[65:04.48]So, wait a minute.
[65:05.10]What about this?
[65:07.42]City of Tears.
[65:16.93]Well, this is a different path, I guess, you could take.
[65:21.46]And I thought I hit him with that, but apparently not.
[65:28.98]Oh, I am bad at this.
[65:29.94]Just don't fall.
[65:37.08]I don't give a shit anything else.
[65:41.36]Just don't fall down.
[65:44.32]You fall, you die.
[65:46.00]Let's just put it that way.
[65:46.74]Ooh.
[65:48.56]Sacred.
[65:53.74]Hallownest seal.
[65:56.84]Still don't really understand what I'm supposed to do with those.
[65:58.60]I mean, did I use one of those to open this door?
[66:08.00]I don't know.
[66:11.30]My new Londo?
[66:12.82]I may as well be.
[66:18.90]Anor Londo.

[66:50.54]A plus commentary, Jeremy.
[66:54.79]We've got a fat guy.
[66:57.51]Ha ha!

[67:01.63]I don't know.
[67:02.03]I'm going to go up here first.
[67:07.93]Hey, Scullendollin.
[67:09.05]Thank you for the 15 bucks.
[67:10.57]And Scullin says, Can you autograph a picture of bread and mail it to me?
[67:16.78]Um, I don't know.
[67:19.46]Why do you want me to autograph bread?
[67:23.28]Shit.
[67:24.92]Oh, that's a double shit right there.
[67:28.38]Oh, that's a triple shit.
[67:29.31]I wonder how many shits I'm gonna be taking tonight.
[67:43.95]for the still spot to go.
[67:45.03]I really need a map lord.
[67:47.02]Whatever his name is.

[68:19.02]Where was the caterpillar village?
[68:21.28]It's in Dirtmouth somewhere, right?
[68:24.58]I can hear him.
[68:26.38]Whoa, what are you doing in here?

[68:43.85]Good burger, thanks for the five bucks.
[68:44.95]Can you autograph a picture of Star and send it to me?
[68:49.60]That would be a forgery, so no.
[68:50.88]I ain't gonna be in trouble for forgery.
[68:53.82]This is a long ways up.
[69:01.90]This better be worth it.
[69:09.54]This had better be worth it.

[70:26.66]What is that?
[70:27.32]I'm opening a lot of doors.
[70:30.28]I'm not sure, like, what it's doing for me, though.
[70:33.50]But I guess we're just gonna go down.
[70:35.26]Is that as far as I can go?
[70:40.01]No, okay.
[70:44.55]Can I go any further down?
[70:45.81]I guess I'm just going to go all the way down.

[74:47.44]You're not gonna pull this shit on me.
[74:52.24]This guy's not even hard.
[74:54.78]They're making a big deal out of this.
[75:00.90]As I die to the guy.
[75:03.00]Oh, great.
[75:03.60]You're going to give me a gauntlet?
[75:06.78]Not fair.
[75:08.20]But it is fair.
[75:10.38]That guy's not even in his room.
[75:14.68]Okay.
[75:16.00]I'll just heal to full health.
[75:18.61]Well, the game bugs on me a little bit.
[75:23.35]Alright.
[75:30.69]Oh, fat guy.
[75:31.47]Yeah, there's a fat guy.
[75:33.67]Yeah, give me a map.
[75:40.10]Yes.
[75:45.00]Much better.
[75:46.02]Much better.
[75:46.58]Now I can actually see.
[75:48.86]What is this?
[75:51.48]Yes, I definitely want a bench.
[76:00.41]That is cute.
[76:02.85]Alright.
[76:05.19]Transformer symbol.
[76:07.41]I need another notch.
[76:10.05]Let's go.
[76:20.84]Little bench top, right?
[76:21.76]Stag station also.
[76:22.86]Let's get that.
[76:23.92]Let's make our way over there.
[76:24.80]Oh, this is a fucking hack-looking motherfucker.
[76:31.49]Watch where you're going, you soggy vagabond.
[76:33.47]I don't want you splashing me.
[76:35.69]Mm-hmm.
[76:38.19]Yeah.
[76:39.47]Yeah.
[76:41.17]Hey, good burger.
[76:41.83]Thank you for the five dollars.
[76:43.37]Can you autograph a picture, sir?
[76:44.59]That's what he said.
[76:45.53]He said that like eight minutes ago.
[76:46.79]Sorry.
[76:51.05]Okay.
[76:52.85]Yeah.
[76:53.63]I don't give a shit of what you have to say.
[76:54.83]Can I fight this guy finally?
[76:55.85]Can I cut his other ear off?
[76:57.59]Hey.
[76:58.40]Get some sleep.
[77:04.30]Whatever.
[77:05.48]No more squares for the rest of the stream.
[77:10.63]No more F-words.
[77:15.49]Ha!
[77:19.36]Okay, this is just a huge city.
[77:24.68]Huge city down.
[77:29.66]So this looks like a little shortcut.
[77:32.12]It is.
[77:33.98]Yeah, that's just a shortcut to get up here.
[77:41.14]Two minutes, 23 seconds.
[77:41.69]Alright, so I'm going to keep the timer.
[77:42.85]That's fine.
[77:45.81]No swearing at all.
[77:46.99]And I mean at all.
[77:48.15]Not even like D-A-M-N.
[77:54.26]What are these?
[77:58.78]These... Little orange peel trees.
[78:02.35]What do they do?
[78:03.93]What is their purpose?
[78:07.23]I feel like they do something, but I just don't know what.
[78:16.97]That room is totally useless, apparently.
[78:30.44]H-E double hockey sticks.
[78:34.62]These little side rooms are useless.
[78:38.48]What the hell?
[78:42.66]Oh, by the way, already failed.
[78:44.76]It did take two minutes and 23 seconds.
[78:49.69]That's not a swear.
[78:50.52]No, that's not a swear.
[78:51.40]That's a place.
[78:52.76]That is a noun, guys.
[78:54.36]That's a noun.
[78:55.40]That's not a swear.
[78:56.00]That's a noun.
[78:57.52]You can't count a noun as a swear.
[79:05.47]Hell is a place in books.
[79:08.99]It's written down.
[79:19.47]Alright, well, we want to go this way.
[79:25.37]Anything else?
[79:26.25]Nope.
[79:29.79]It's a place.
[79:30.59]It's an actual, like, place in literature.
[79:34.81]That's like saying you're going to... Like, the ball.
[79:40.29]Or, like, ballpark.
[79:42.63]Is ballpark considered a square?
[79:45.02]No.
[79:46.26]Is the 99 restaurant considered a square?
[79:48.86]No.
[79:51.33]So, I'm fine.
[79:53.75]It's just like a place.
[79:55.55]And I need to jump on these spikes to get those.
[80:00.57]I don't think I can get those.
[80:11.14]No.
[80:13.80]Yeah, go ahead.
[80:14.34]You know people say like, go to hell.
[80:16.76]Yeah, that's like saying, go to the ballpark.
[80:20.54]Hey, get out of here.
[80:22.20]You can go to the 99 restaurant.
[80:33.05]Here we are.
[80:33.59]Hopefully it's not that expensive.
[80:34.87]It is kind of expensive.
[80:41.92]I'm telling.
[80:44.10]If you only had some kind of coin magnet.
[80:46.10]Yeah, but that means I wouldn't... What happens if I stand here while he... Let me ring the bell and stand there.
[80:50.53]Does he, like, run me over?
[80:53.77]No, he's a good boy.
[81:00.81]Cool.
[81:04.72]City storerooms is where we are.
[81:06.24]Got it.
[81:08.62]So it looks like we're going to go to the left.
[81:11.55]I know.
[81:13.93]99 restaurant?
[81:14.33]Yeah.
[81:14.51]That's what it is.
[81:21.75]Wait, the stag has a quest line?
[81:23.39]Isn't that what I'm doing?
[81:24.09]But I thought that just was to open all the stagways.
[81:41.19]He's kind of just saying the same thing, isn't he?
[81:50.59]Alright, over to the left.
[81:52.19]I got a feeling we're gonna run into a boss here in a shooo- agh.
[82:11.06]Reminds you of Salt and Sanctuary?
[82:13.02]It's kind of similar.
[82:14.28]They're both 2D... You know, moderately difficult... Action, adventure... Rogue-like games.
[82:26.46]A total machine of 150!
[82:27.12]Just barely enough.
[82:34.28]Ah, this is going to bring me to that.
[82:35.38]Okay.
[82:36.62]I know where this is going to go.
[82:38.58]I ran into this the other day, didn't I?
[82:41.92]And I was like, I can't get in there.
[82:43.02]Well, let's see where it takes me.
[82:49.62]Yep.
[82:50.68]This is exactly where I thought it was going to take me.
[82:54.13]But instead, now I can go this way.
[82:55.95]Because I couldn't go here before.
[82:59.37]So...
[83:02.52]Where on Earth am I going now?
[83:11.73]Definitely a roguelike.
[83:12.65]It is.
[83:16.31]You guys wouldn't consider this a roguelike?
[83:19.63]If I die, I lose all my money.
[83:22.97]And the money is essentially just souls.
[83:25.23]That's all it is.
[83:27.53]And you have to go collect your souls if you die.
[83:29.79]And if you die twice, you lose it all.
[83:32.11]It's like Dark Souls-y, you know, RPG-esque, where you need to use the money to upgrade certain things and buy certain things.
[83:38.95]I would consider it like that, yeah.
[83:42.89]Ow.
[83:44.11]You wouldn't?
[83:44.59]What?
[83:49.72]What?
[83:50.14]No!
[83:50.32]What are you doing with all these no's?
[83:52.60]Excuse me!
[83:58.14]In a roguelike, when you die, you lose everything.
[84:02.28]That's what happens in this game.
[84:03.67]When you die in this game, you lose all your souls.
[84:06.19]And you have to go back and get it.
[84:09.51]Dark Souls is a roguelike.
[84:10.55]Yeah.
[84:13.67]It's not a permanent roguelike.
[84:15.17]The definition of a roguelike is a permanent death and you have to start over.
[84:18.26]A Binding of Isaac is a roguelike.
[84:21.70]Like a true one.
[84:22.46]Where if you die, that's it.
[84:25.89]Games like that are true roguelikes.
[84:27.39]But, I mean, this is like a roguelite.
[84:28.91]They call it roguelite.
[84:35.39]Yeah, well, that's like a roguelike... What are you talking about?
[84:38.23]What are you guys on about?
[84:42.43]Roguelike is permadeath.
[84:43.87]I know.
[84:44.69]But, like, it still can have roguelike tendencies and be, like, considered in the same category.
[84:51.79]Because if you die in this game, you lose everything.
[84:57.74]Rogues are procedurally generated.
[84:59.16]They don't have to be.
[85:04.72]They don't have to be a... It doesn't have to be a procedurally generated game to be a roguelike.
[85:10.66]They call them roguelites.
[85:12.62]L-I-T-E.
[85:14.43]Roguelite.
[85:15.65]Or like... It doesn't matter.
[85:20.07]Everything doesn't have to be random and roguelike.
[85:23.57]Roguelike elements.
[85:31.02]Okay, well, that was a different piece.
[85:37.05]I mean, if you want to be, like, a purist about the whole thing, you can say, but, like, we're beyond genres now, guys.
[85:42.55]You understand?
[85:44.49]We're not in genres anymore.
[85:45.89]There's no such thing as a genre because there's too many melds of genres.
[85:48.49]You know what I'm saying?
[85:52.34]Is that all that was over here?
[85:59.06]We're beyond those types of labels now.
[86:05.04]I think there's nothing else here?
[86:06.08]Yeah, of course there is.
[86:14.14]You can say a game has roguelike elements, but that's all I was trying to really say.
[86:18.15]Like, I wasn't trying to say this is, like, a purest, like, pure roguelike video game.
[86:22.53]I just said, yeah, it's, like, roguelike.
[86:23.73]Come on!
[86:26.09]Somebody fucking calling me from... Where the... What the fuck was that?
[86:30.61]Somebody called me for .2 seconds.
[86:34.84]Why?
[86:35.06]Okay, so that's that.
[86:42.24]Alright, well that's... There's a lot of places I can go now.
[86:48.97]Let me look.
[86:51.91]City of Tears.
[86:53.17]I guess I could go right from the City of Tears.
[86:55.43]We'll try that.
[86:57.79]Yeah, I'm already exploring there anyways.
[87:01.47]It's the roguelike police.
[87:02.89]Yeah, the roguelike police are calling me.
[87:11.97]Nice distraction call.
[87:14.83]Yeah, somebody called me to get us off that debate.
[87:20.69]I lost my dirt blocks when I died in Minecraft.
[87:22.91]Minecraft is a roguelike.
[87:24.33]No, but like...
[87:26.68]This game is very hard.
[87:29.85]The bosses are very hard.
[87:31.21]You're going to lose at these bosses.
[87:33.59]It's going to happen.
[87:35.45]When you die to one of these bosses, you lose all of your money.
[87:39.67]If you don't go get it back, it's gone forever.
[87:42.31]That's a roguelike element.
[87:43.59]This is a very difficult, extremely difficult game where you can permanently lose shit.
[87:49.38]That's very important.
[87:50.42]That's a roguelike element.
[88:03.10]Wait, can I even get up here?
[88:07.36]So hard, very hard.
[88:12.38]That's a souls element.
[88:14.96]No, but the souls elements are rogue-like elements.
[88:18.76]Saying a game is a souls-like is saying it's like a rogue-like, because Dark Souls is like a rogue-like, it's a souls-like.
[88:24.00]You lose stuff permanently when you die.
[88:25.66]It's a rogue souls-like, it's a rogues-like.
[88:27.92]It's a souls-rogue.
[88:30.23]That's what I'm talking about.
[88:30.87]There's no genres anymore.
[88:31.90]They don't exist anymore.
[88:32.84]They don't need to.
[88:34.36]Okay, we're going down.
[88:45.03]Down to the right.
[88:55.73]Please, stop!
[88:56.61]Are people actually mad?
[88:58.01]I mean, at this point, I'm just kinda having fun with you guys.
[89:01.27]That's where we are at this point.
[89:05.09]But yes, I do actually think that this game has rogue-like elements.
[89:07.76]Like, it does.
[89:10.04]And if you disagree, then my God!
[89:13.24]My God, are you wrong!
[89:15.42]Okay, fuck, hold on.
[89:19.14]I don't wanna die.
[89:21.30]I'm gonna pick this up.
[89:24.58]Ooh, key!
[89:26.09]That thing is 900 bucks.
[89:28.51]I just got one for free.
[89:34.63]No, I'm kidding, guys.
[89:37.08]Yeah, it's a slug leg.
[89:41.44]Oh, boy.
[89:41.76]I'm going to get in trouble here.
[89:42.72]Let's dash through.
[89:45.56]I just need to go down.
[89:48.48]To the right.
[89:48.86]Yep.
[89:58.03]Got a key.
[90:00.17]Let's go down and touch this thing.
[90:08.00]Hey, James Ors, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[90:13.48]Did I assume this game's gender?
[90:16.17]No, I'm just saying.
[90:17.41]All I'm saying is it doesn't even matter.
[90:18.83]I don't give a fuck.
[90:24.41]You could be a rogue-like, you could be a souls-like, I don't care!
[90:27.70]You're accepted here!
[90:37.48]Cold streamer, why am I a cold streamer?
[90:40.86]Yeah, then right, I could go a few ways.
[90:43.30]We'll try upright.
[90:46.80]Like, this way.
[90:55.39]Well, this is new.
[90:56.67]Is this a boss or what is this?
[91:05.38]Okay, well, you teleport around and you're very annoying.
[91:08.18]You're very annoying.
[91:11.56]This guy didn't have a name, did he?
[91:13.68]I think he's just a mini boss.
[91:17.85]We shall... Oh, I don't know.
[91:20.93]Seems a little... Seems a little difficult for a mini boss, in my opinion.
[91:29.51]I don't want to run into him.
[91:39.33]Well, there we go.
[91:40.19]He was a mini-boss.
[91:42.10]He was kind of hard, though.
[91:44.40]He's just a regular enemy.
[91:46.94]Well.
[91:48.32]Oakily doakily.
[92:02.57]Yeah, Star Wars Rogue One is a roguelike.
[92:09.68]It is!
[92:13.82]I hear Mr. Map.
[92:15.52]I'm a little confused at the moment.
[92:23.05]Why is there another map here?
[92:25.51]It's a slot for a key.
[92:29.30]Apparently a key I don't have.
[92:33.40]Ooh.
[92:34.54]Can I get up there?
[92:36.36]Oh, shit, I can.
[92:38.32]What is this?
[92:43.78]Nothing much, apparently.
[92:50.17]Yeah, you know what?
[92:51.35]Excuse me.
[92:52.91]Rogue One is a roguelike.
[92:54.25]They die in the movie.
[92:55.33]That's right.
[92:56.05]They die in the movie.
[92:58.07]Like, if you like die in a movie, like the stormtroopers in Rogue One.
[93:01.99]Like, if you're a stormtrooper and you fucking die in that movie, you don't come back.
[93:08.82]There's plenty of stormtroopers that die in that movie.
[93:10.88]Like, they die.
[93:12.36]They don't fucking come back.
[93:16.38]And guess what?
[93:17.66]In the movie Taken...
[93:21.75]in Taken, when he, when, when Liam, when Liam McGregor, whatever his name is.
[93:27.21]Spoilers, what, what do you mean spoilers?
[93:28.77]What are you talking about?
[93:30.05]What are you talking about?
[93:31.25]I, I said Stormtroopers.
[93:33.65]Nobody, nobody dies in Rogue One.
[93:36.28]Just Stormtroopers.
[93:42.90]Hey, look, the game came out, the fucking movie came out in like December, alright?
[93:46.78]If you wanted to see Rogue One, you would have watched it already.
[93:53.60]If you wanted to watch Rogue One, if you hadn't seen it, this movie came out fucking like six months ago.
[94:01.17]So, you know, when a stormtrooper dies in Rogue One,
[94:20.12]No, not the stormtroopers.
[94:22.14]That's what I was saying.
[94:23.20]When the stormtroopers die, they don't come back.
[94:25.99]When they die in the movie, they don't come back.
[94:30.05]That's it.
[94:31.53]That's it.
[94:33.21]Only the stormtroopers die.
[94:36.11]Only the stormtroopers die in Rogue One.
[94:42.22]And you gotta admit, that was a pretty good damage control save, right?
[94:48.48]That was a pretty good save.
[94:50.69]So that's what I was saying.
[94:52.75]It was a real good save.
[95:03.27]I gotta like focus again.
[95:07.95]Oh my god.
[95:10.05]That is actually fucking funny though.
[95:11.85]Come on.
[95:13.05]The movie came out like fucking a year ago.
[95:19.45]Rogue One came out like fucking three years ago.
[95:21.60]No big deal.
[95:25.58]Not a big deal, guys.
[95:28.72]So, like, yeah.
[95:32.66]Spoilers.
[95:34.03]I never give spoilers.
[95:34.91]That wasn't even a spoiler.
[95:37.11]You could say that about any movie.
[95:38.53]And what are you going to call it?
[95:39.55]Spoilers?
[95:42.61]That's like, okay, Bambi.
[95:44.11]You know, Bambi's mother dies in Bambi, guys.
[95:48.29]Oh no.
[95:49.55]If you haven't seen Bambi by now, you ain't gonna see it.
[95:52.31]Those of you guys that are upset about the Rogue One spoilers, I got, hey, don't worry.
[95:56.02]Let me spoil the whole movie for you.
[95:57.64]It sucks.
[95:59.06]Don't worry.
[95:59.44]Don't even see it.
[96:00.22]You don't even have to go see it.
[96:01.58]You've already seen it.
[96:03.02]It ain't a good movie.
[96:04.52]It's like a solid 5 out of 10 movie.
[96:07.58]It's a 7 out of 10 if you love Star Wars.
[96:09.60]It's alright, don't worry.
[96:23.59]Are you gonna watch Bambi after this stream?
[96:35.51]Spoilers unsubbed.
[96:41.70]I've only seen one movie.
[96:43.56]Wallace and Gromit, Curse of the Werebear.
[96:47.49]It sucked.
[96:47.95]It's alright.
[96:48.49]What's the truth?
[96:52.59]Yeah.
[96:53.39]Star Wars Rogue One, a roguelike story, is a 5 out of 10 movie.
[97:00.31]It is a 7 out of 10 movie if you love Star Wars.
[97:05.43]Because, you know, whatever.
[97:07.01]They go into the bar and it's like...
[97:11.82]And you're like, oh, wow, I remember that!
[97:13.18]Cantina!
[97:13.82]Cool!
[97:15.87]If you took all the Star Wars shit... Okay, by the way, by the way.
[97:20.11]Excuse me.
[97:21.13]Excuse me.
[97:23.17]Where are the, uh... No, that's a spoiler.
[97:25.31]Never mind.
[97:25.93]We don't do spoilers in this chat.

[101:36.12]Yeah, that's not the right size, by the way.
[101:37.91]That needs to be, like, bigger.

[101:41.77]I fucked up a couple of them.
[101:44.03]I will make them bigger.
[101:47.44]But anyways, Hunter Normandy.
[101:49.58]Gave 50 bucks.

[101:58.00]But, thank you so much for the 50 bucks.
[102:01.62]There's your small taste of what that looks like.
[102:07.37]But, yeah, they say, Hunter Normandy, thank you.
[102:08.87]It says, so when does the Jerma calendar drop?
[102:10.71]By the way, all the stormtroopers in Bambi die.

[102:15.15]Yeah, all those people, all the stormtroopers in Disney's Bambi.
[102:25.16]Well, yeah, thank you, man.
[102:27.12]That's a lot of money.
[102:29.20]So, when I play games and I start, like, talking shit...
[102:34.31]This is the most I've died.
[102:35.31]There you go, guys.
[102:35.99]Like, I can't, like, have, like, a deep conversation and, like, talk a bunch of stuff and, like, say a bunch of... and play a video game at the same time.
[102:44.46]It's never gonna happen.
[102:46.44]Like, I'm still confused.
[102:48.28]Like, we've been talking for, like, ten minutes.
[102:49.86]I've died, like, three times.
[102:51.36]And I have no idea where I'm going.
[102:54.53]This is the only time I've had this problem.
[102:58.20]in the entire time I played this game.
[103:00.80]Because my brain is too small to talk and play video games at the exact same time.
[103:04.70]Well.
[103:08.62]So we need to go this way and up.
[103:12.23]And I'm not gonna fuck around.
[103:13.23]Ow.
[103:29.59]Okay, he's dead.
[103:30.81]Those guys can hang up on you.
[103:39.23]Yeah, the new bit animations are very well done from Blordow.
[103:47.96]They're fantastic.
[103:50.28]I just need to do some resizing on a couple of them in Twitch Alerts, in Streamlabs, whatever you want to call it.
[103:55.09]Oh, come on, get out of the way.
[103:59.41]But they're kind of there now.
[104:06.14]The extremely talented Blordow.
[104:09.04]I believe he's here right now.
[104:10.02]Say hello.
[104:12.44]Say your hellos to Mr. Blordow.
[104:13.89]Okay, we got two of these now.
[104:39.04]Jeez.
[104:40.96]Jeez!
[104:43.06]Don't talk to me.
[104:46.41]Nobody talk to me.
[104:47.45]Alright, I gotta full everything.
[104:52.61]Let me save that and then get hit.
[104:54.77]Like a fucking dumbass.
[105:15.40]Okay.
[105:15.86]Fill that shit up.
[105:17.70]And let me keep moving.
[105:19.42]That'd be wonderful.
[105:22.56]It's already done.
[105:23.20]There's that weirdo in the chair.
[105:24.60]Here's the thing that says, Spooky, spooky, booo!
[105:30.47]Don't die to the mini-boss.
[105:31.43]I wouldn't have if I wasn't talking shit about Rogue One.
[105:35.11]I wasn't even talking shit about Roblox.
[105:42.38]Alright, here we go.
[105:49.81]Don't die to mini boss man.
[106:07.48]Well, he kind of sucked me in there.
[106:08.64]I got like a vortexed.
[106:09.50]For some reason, I thought I could hit him with his own thing.
[106:23.03]Well, that was not worth it.
[106:37.00]Oh shit.
[106:48.80]Okay.
[106:50.72]That wasn't so bad.
[106:53.74]Just don't lose to the fucking mini-boss.
[107:01.89]Still going.
[107:02.61]Still going.
[107:04.03]Another one of these dumb magicians.
[107:10.96]I don't like that you can do that.
[107:12.56]You shouldn't be able to have that dumb floating orb there.
[107:15.20]How come you get the Binding Vise familiar and I don't?
[107:19.02]This is such an awkward place to fight this guy.
[107:22.58]It really is.
[107:24.19]Like, fuck this.
[107:24.81]We're going outside.
[107:25.43]No, we're not going outside.
[107:26.59]This is the worst possible place to fight you.
[107:30.07]I can't think of a worse place to fight this fucking guy.
[107:34.41]Like, fuck off, man.
[107:55.85]Amen.
[109:43.55]Hi.
[109:43.95]Sorry.
[109:46.85]Sorry about that.
[109:51.18]But here's your BRB.
[109:52.90]And the new BRB screen, I wanted just to like spring it on you guys.
[109:56.18]And see the reaction.
[109:58.26]How fucking awesome is this?
[110:02.40]Cool, huh?
[110:04.00]Yeah.
[110:05.56]I wanted to spring that on you guys and see what you guys had to say.
[110:08.04]Because that is also new.
[110:11.62]Everything's fine.
[110:12.08]Yeah, everything's okay.
[110:16.81]Sorry about that.
[110:21.03]Where the hell am I going this way?
[110:23.41]Uh, up.
[110:29.13]I scared you?
[110:33.59]I guess I didn't just say, hold on one second.
[110:35.17]I thought I did.
[110:36.67]Maybe I, like, turned my mic off.
[110:37.95]Yeah, I think that's what happened.
[110:39.87]I turned my mic off as I was saying, like, hold on, I'll be right back.
[110:42.99]And I muted my mic like a fucking idiot.
[110:45.43]Well, sorry.
[110:49.81]We're almost at the top here.
[110:50.75]I got a feeling that's preparing me for something.
[110:54.55]I don't know what though.
[111:08.77]I hate those guys.
[111:09.45]I don't like the teleportation.
[111:12.37]I don't like their fucking teleportation device that they have.
[111:20.29]I'm confused right now.
[111:24.49]Wasn't I already here?
[111:29.23]I was, right?
[111:31.71]What is this?
[111:33.01]Maybe I wasn't already here.
[111:36.71]No, I... yeah, I... what?
[111:39.41]We're getting all kinds of turned around right now.
[111:41.91]And this stupid fucking shit enemy is ruining everything.
[111:50.15]This dumb teleporting enemy is making me sincerely question my life.
[111:55.15]And where I am.
[111:56.21]And what I'm doing with it.
[111:59.02]Not another one of these fucking... I hate these things.
[112:04.34]This is the worst enemy in the game.
[112:10.42]Any enemy that flies and can teleport and shoots projectiles.
[112:15.92]Delete it.
[112:25.70]I really don't know where I'm supposed to be going.
[112:27.98]They give lots of loot.
[112:28.70]They do.
[112:29.30]That is true.
[112:34.72]I'm opening... It seems to be... I'm opening a lot of doors that don't even matter to be opened.
[112:38.56]Does that feel like it makes any sense?
[112:42.19]I feel like half these doors don't need to be opened.
[112:44.53]Well, this is enclosed.
[113:01.73]I feel like that's a boss.
[113:04.38]Yeah, hold on.
[113:06.74]Not doing that yet.
[113:08.92]Do the rest of the stream in a British accent.
[113:10.62]Why?
[113:15.68]My British accent is not good.
[113:18.46]My British accent turns into an Australian accent, which turns into a Boston accent.
[113:34.91]There's one way to do it.
[113:39.24]Getting a lot of money, which is concerning me.
[113:46.24]Spell twister!
[113:47.16]What is this?
[113:49.89]Reflecting the design.
[113:51.21]Reduce the solo cost of casting spells.
[113:53.27]Okay.
[113:55.79]So you really can just be like a caster, huh?
[113:57.75]If you really wanted to.
[114:03.95]That's like the third spellcasting charm I came across so far.
[114:08.93]Interesting, though.
[114:11.38]Oh my god, I'm just falling down.
[114:15.58]I feel like there's a bench somewhere over here that I'm missing.
[114:18.60]Because if there's a boss right there, I don't have to walk that far.
[114:23.78]Right?
[114:24.07]I'm not crazy, right?
[114:26.51]There's got to be something.
[114:29.29]That bench is too far away from my liking.
[114:31.51]I'd like to get another one.
[114:38.67]Guess not.
[114:43.23]No, whatever.
[114:45.46]Might as well just go for it.
[114:46.36]Yeah, this is already all open.
[115:05.00]Isn't there a bench in this area?
[115:06.06]I just need to sit down with the... Whatever.
[115:09.77]There's a shortcut to the bench I already have.
[115:14.75]Did I get it?
[115:15.27]I feel like I haven't opened that yet.
[115:22.87]I really wish I could fucking see where I even was.
[115:27.10]Let me buy an item that lets me update the map on the fly or something.
[115:30.34]Wait, what?
[115:34.83]I'd love that.
[115:39.75]Well, let's go for it.
[115:40.61]Just gonna try.
[115:41.13]Here we go.
[115:51.52]Alright.
[115:52.60]Take a sip.
[115:55.32]I see a thing floating in the background.
[115:57.12]Here they come.
[115:58.30]Or they're gonna shoot at me.
[116:00.90]Halo.
[116:01.54]The Soul Master!
[116:04.75]Oh no, it's a teleporting ranged enemy!
[116:06.95]Let's just watch him for a little bit.
[116:14.06]Wow.
[116:14.58]Okay, I can jump over him.
[116:23.00]Shit.
[116:44.32]Fuck around with that.
[116:53.47]Come on.
[116:53.89]Why the fuck did they fly off camera left?
[116:57.99]What's going on?
[116:58.35]Okay.
[117:05.40]He like deflates He's not that bad
[117:54.52]Back this way Fuck man, I keep soaking.
[118:03.38]Yeah, that's annoying.
[118:04.78]Oh
[118:20.41]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[118:23.25]Got too greedy there.
[118:28.19]Dash.
[118:32.25]Okay, that's much better.
[118:33.11]He's moving faster.
[118:45.34]Stand in my shit.
[118:57.47]Damn.
[118:58.55]Damn it.
[119:02.61]Gotcha!
[119:13.49]First try!
[119:14.33]Ha!
[119:15.78]Oh, you have an elaborate death.
[119:22.34]And that's a new thing.
[119:23.20]I haven't seen that before.
[119:24.18]Something new.
[119:31.59]He's back.
[119:33.47]Oh boy.
[119:34.13]This is not over.
[119:36.23]Oh, come on.
[119:37.05]Really?
[119:38.19]Oh, what the fuck?
[119:43.25]Hold on.
[119:44.09]Slow it down.
[119:54.56]Come on.
[119:55.06]Fuck you.
[119:57.18]I just have to dodge this.
[120:10.61]It's not bad.
[120:11.11]It's actually not bad.
[120:11.95]It's okay.
[120:28.93]Shit.
[120:31.85]Well, I got one.
[120:50.41]Finally, will you die?
[120:51.23]No more surprises.
[120:53.37]Alright, he's dead.
[120:58.63]That was easier than the first form.
[121:01.85]Right?
[121:02.09]That's it.
[121:04.31]Am I gonna grab this?
[121:05.09]Is he gonna turn into like a third thing or something?
[121:07.14]I don't understand.
[121:08.76]Let me be prepared for this if it happens again.
[121:12.66]Don't do it again.
[121:13.40]Don't do it a third time.
[121:17.96]He's the guy that grunts too much at the gym.
[121:24.81]Well, there's my ground breaker.
[121:30.37]Cool.
[121:33.45]Nice.
[121:36.49]Now how do I get out of here?
[121:42.31]Oh, that's convenient.
[121:46.27]Nothing else in here?
[121:52.54]There's my moon shoes, yep.
[121:56.74]I guess I can keep going... left?
[121:58.58]I don't think so, maybe not.
[122:05.21]Why does it look like an exit?
[122:08.73]How come I can't open that door?
[122:10.01]Come on.
[122:14.37]I still have the regular shitty weapon, by the way.
[122:21.49]Nice.
[122:22.37]Ooh, lots of money.
[122:27.90]Cool.
[122:28.92]There's my reward.
[122:43.94]Oh, that's right.
[122:44.82]I can smash the fucking glass.
[122:46.64]I just got it.
[122:47.40]I just got it like four seconds ago, guys.
[122:49.62]Come on.
[122:51.82]Cut me a little bit slack.
[122:52.72]I just got this like three seconds ago.
[122:54.74]I didn't even know you could break the glass here.
[122:57.19]Do we have any... Is Jerm of Fear available yet?
[123:13.08]Where's Jerm of Fear?
[123:15.24]Oh, what's that?
[123:20.04]I think I hate those enemies more than anything else.
[123:25.59]I hate those things.
[123:27.21]I don't like the enemies in this area.
[123:28.79]There's another seal.
[123:43.88]Okay, where am I even going?
[123:45.62]There were multiple places where I could drop through the ceiling, right?
[123:50.77]What about, like, over here?
[123:51.51]Anything?
[123:51.75]I think it was, like, up.
[123:55.70]What about right now?
[123:56.66]I already did that.
[124:01.60]Whatever!
[124:02.02]I opened that.
[124:08.01]Can I do anything else down here?
[124:10.43]I don't think so.
[124:18.27]Alright, there's that.
[124:19.10]I already did that.
[124:20.56]Just checking.
[124:21.94]Let's go back.
[124:27.46]Wait, go back where?
[124:31.41]Can I break through anything down here?
[124:32.61]No.
[124:32.79]Wait, wait, wait.
[124:37.58]Hold on.
[124:56.86]Go that way.
[124:57.42]How do I get how do I get in there?
[124:58.66]I want to get the fucking caterpillar Here okay, yep do that.
[125:07.59]Oh what?
[125:09.59]No, that's not what I wanted
[125:34.35]Wait, what are you guys talking about?
[125:40.31]I'm trying to, like, get all the stuff in the area.
[125:49.29]You guys need to lay off, alright?
[125:52.48]I wanted to get the caterpillar guy.
[125:55.54]Hey, I want everybody to just lay off, alright?
[126:00.18]I got the caterpillar guy.
[126:01.12]That's what I wanted.
[126:05.40]Was there anything over here?
[126:06.14]Um, I don't think so.
[126:09.56]Did I fail for the trap?
[126:11.50]What trap?
[126:11.96]I don't need that.
[126:22.27]Oh, laying off.
[126:31.75]Ooh, lanterns.
[126:35.54]I don't know.
[126:36.26]I wonder what I do here.
[126:37.42]I don't know.
[126:40.64]Um... Cha!
[126:41.81]Where the hell am I?
[126:48.91]Okay, I'm here now.
[127:04.82]Alright, now I can break through the ground, but the question is... Where the hell was that?
[127:14.48]There's at least a few areas.
[127:16.58]Back in, like... Like the Queen's Chamber, maybe?
[127:20.38]I don't even remember.
[127:21.92]I remember there was a ground that was huge, and I was like, oh, this is shaking, and I couldn't do anything to it.
[127:27.86]Where was that?
[127:28.58]I don't fucking remember.
[127:36.67]This brings me back here.
[127:37.73]This goes this way.
[127:41.97]Oh, God.
[127:42.49]We're just like a whole other rabbit hole.
[127:43.95]Hold on.
[127:44.39]It's in the mines.
[127:57.17]Wait, what happened?
[127:57.69]$9.85?
[127:57.75]What's $9.85?
[127:57.95]Oh!
[127:58.03]$9.85!
[127:58.05]I can't collect any more money.
[128:17.88]What is the way to get out of there?
[128:19.00]I'm just... Yeah, just get me out of here.
[128:30.34]Just get me back to the mines.
[128:34.89]Oh, right, with the person that was singing.
[128:36.17]The one that was like...
[128:49.30]I wanna go right and down.
[128:51.40]The Soul Sanctum.
[129:01.33]Oh, where's the stag?
[129:02.97]Is there a stag here?
[129:03.81]All the way over there.
[129:04.59]Fucking hell.
[129:06.63]Oh, fucking hell.
[129:09.13]This meat.
[129:10.17]So tender.
[129:11.57]Fucking hell.
[129:16.12]Let's go back to the bench.
[129:17.78]Let's fill our shit in here.
[129:19.36]Alright.
[129:26.50]That's it.
[129:28.55]There we go.
[129:30.39]Almost all this has been explored except for the bottom right.
[129:32.67]But I kind of don't give a shit about that right now.
[129:35.23]I want to get out of here.
[129:36.65]And I want to go into the mines.
[129:43.88]Uh oh.
[129:50.25]Let's go.
[129:50.65]So I just need to go left and then up.
[129:58.96]What do I want to go up?
[130:00.54]What's down there?
[130:08.93]Don't touch me.
[130:12.03]Don't touch me.
[130:15.76]What about down here?
[130:16.62]There's a whole area, like, to the right that I haven't even seen.
[130:19.94]No, I have seen it.
[130:20.62]Why is it not updating on my map?
[130:25.82]Like, this shit isn't updating on my map because I'm not going there.
[130:28.79]That makes perfect sense.
[130:34.77]So, we need to go down to the right or down to the left?
[130:37.37]We're going to go down.
[130:38.11]I hear a bug.
[130:38.71]I hear a little boy.
[130:39.45]I hear a bug boy.
[130:40.89]Where's the bug?
[130:44.66]Bug boy?
[130:44.86]Bug boy?
[130:50.00]Well, just skip these guys.
[130:51.14]Fuck it.
[130:51.44]Oh my god, please.
[130:59.41]I don't want to fight you idiots.
[131:02.95]Down here.
[131:06.57]Hot Springs is down here, right?
[131:07.77]I might as well just go sit in it.
[131:11.54]Yeah, we're going to sit in it.
[131:13.02]Oh, this is a store.
[131:13.84]Okay.
[131:19.71]Alright.
[131:22.18]So you guys are telling me that just sell all this shit.
[131:26.86]There's no other use for this in the game.
[131:32.30]If I sell all this and I become like a trillionaire, there's no other use for this shit in the game.
[131:37.00]Right?
[131:38.29]I'm not going to get surprised here.
[131:41.61]And I... Oh, you need two hollow nest seals.
[131:48.15]Just sell it?
[131:51.14]There's literally no other use for the game.
[131:55.24]Okay.
[131:59.80]Hmm.
[132:01.41]Nobody knows at this point.
[132:02.35]Like, they might have some use, but whatever.
[132:03.91]Okay.
[132:05.99]We're just... We're gonna get rid of all of it.
[132:10.69]Keep one of each, maybe?
[132:16.90]Yeah, and here's another thing, though.
[132:20.08]I need the lantern...
[132:23.29]Yeah, we're dumping all of it.
[132:27.77]Sell them all.
[132:34.64]Sell them all.
[132:38.32]Sell them all.
[132:41.66]We're buying that lantern.
[132:42.80]It's so much money.
[132:43.86]Can I sell more than one at a time?
[132:48.97]Sell them all.
[132:55.12]Pranked.
[132:55.54]What are you talking about?
[132:56.18]Fucking pranked.
[133:00.00]Pranked.
[133:05.72]You need- I need that item.
[133:10.20]What are you talking about?
[133:13.38]Did everyone just fuck with me?
[133:14.84]Do I actually need these?
[133:19.55]Don't do it.
[133:20.17]Oh god, I'm too late.
[133:22.51]Well, thank you for the $10, Mr. Kool-Aid.
[133:25.79]Bellamy Ardred you skipped the dialog?
[133:31.09]Who cares?
[133:39.10]Bellamy Ardred These are these quest items?
[133:43.80]Helma Delka
[133:55.39]I have lots of money right now.
[134:00.51]I gotta be real fucking careful here.
[134:03.65]Really careful.
[134:06.97]We gotta be super careful.
[134:17.78]Just simple key.
[134:20.72]Should I use the simple key here?
[134:21.82]I could always buy another one.
[134:23.12]I'm a millionaire now.
[134:26.65]Thank you, Good Burger, for the five bucks.
[134:28.67]You need the idol for the good ending.
[134:32.31]Is that a waste of a key, you think?
[134:33.35]Or should I use the key on the other door?
[134:35.13]I mean, it's a simple lock.
[134:39.74]I'm gonna do it.
[134:40.24]Fuck it.
[134:41.44]Like, why not?
[134:42.12]Fuck it.
[134:43.56]What's the worst that could happen to her?
[134:46.48]I can always buy another key if I need it.
[134:54.44]Okay.
[134:55.48]What is in here?
[135:00.95]Royal Waterway.
[135:05.30]Oh boy, I'm terrified with this much money on me.
[135:08.98]Don't run into a boss.
[135:10.42]Don't run into a boss.
[135:13.36]Oh.
[135:15.58]What does he do?
[135:21.07]I just want enough to heal, and then I'm leaving.
[135:22.65]I just want enough to heal.
[135:33.48]Oh, fuck this.
[135:34.20]We're leaving.
[135:35.64]I have three.
[135:36.26]I'm fine.
[135:38.97]Nothing else, right?
[135:40.79]No, we ain't doing this without the light.
[135:42.57]Screw that.
[135:47.51]Well, that's open.
[135:48.29]At least it's open, right?
[135:49.13]So we're going all the way to the left.
[135:53.45]Just bank it?
[135:54.35]I'm pretty far away from the bank.
[135:55.89]I'll be alright.
[135:56.77]It's gonna play smart.
[136:11.48]Play smart and get hit.
[136:17.07]Not far now, we just gotta go there.
[136:41.75]So much money.
[136:48.83]Okay.
[136:56.32]New zone here, new little area.
[137:04.60]Don't you do it.
[137:06.16]Don't do it, please!
[137:08.68]I can't have this stress on me right now.
[137:10.20]I gotta dump some of this money.
[137:15.69]I gotta dump at least like 40% of this money.
[137:18.75]So 60% of this money.
[137:22.39]What is this?
[137:22.79]I hear a blacksmith.
[137:27.66]Good.
[137:27.86]Is this the blacksmith guy that you guys were talking about like four hours ago?
[137:30.84]It has to be, right?
[137:37.18]Yeah, has to be.
[137:41.81]Here he is.
[137:43.35]Yes, please, let me... Have you brought me another nail to be honed?
[137:47.27]Leave it on the ground and return later if you're still breathing.
[137:50.26]Oh, I thought you were someone else.
[137:52.88]After a nail smith, are you?
[137:53.78]Well, you found one.
[137:54.60]I'm not much for talk, but if it's a nail that needs repair, then you've come to the right plug.
[137:58.46]Your own nail is in quite a sorry state.
[138:00.12]It's obviously not one of mine.
[138:01.44]Still, anything can be refined with enough effort and skill, even that broken blade.
[138:05.43]If you like, I can reforge your nail.
[138:08.35]It'll make the blade far more deadly.
[138:11.82]That's it?
[138:14.46]That's real cheap, man.
[138:16.26]Can I do it again?
[138:17.04]Can I do this?
[138:21.01]I'll just keep doing this.
[138:23.57]I'll do it again.
[138:24.05]Here we go.
[138:27.09]The reforging is complete.
[138:28.17]I've honed your nail's edge.
[138:28.89]You'll find it much stronger than it used to be.
[138:31.49]Head out there and test it.
[138:34.19]Can I do it again?
[138:37.41]Pale ore.
[138:40.95]I need to bring him Pale Ore.
[138:45.27]Well, okay.
[138:45.87]At least that's better.
[138:50.34]Let's take a look at it.
[138:52.20]Sharpened Nail.
[138:54.44]Restored to Lethal Form.
[138:57.18]Cool.
[139:01.92]Oh, okay.
[139:03.95]Ooh.
[139:05.79]Those are important.
[139:09.65]Well...
[139:11.22]that's done can I like send this guy to town because he's very annoyingly far away well that's good that's so much better only one hit to get rid of those guys pretty much double damage thank god this is gonna make my life ten times easier
[139:40.27]What about these guys?
[139:41.37]One, two, three, four.
[139:44.89]It's so much better.
[139:47.83]It's a thousand leagues better.
[139:49.61]Okay.
[139:55.03]Let's go that way.
[139:56.67]Cross that way.
[140:00.77]The only other place I haven't gone here is right.
[140:02.73]So we're going to go right.
[140:05.09]And then I'm going to shit the bed.
[140:07.50]And make a vlog about it.
[140:10.48]Hey, what's going on guys?
[140:11.42]It's your boy Jerma.
[140:12.26]I just want to say, hey, what's up?
[140:13.32]Do a vlog, do a quick little thing here.
[140:15.14]By the way, shit the bed today.
[140:16.62]Wait.
[140:21.92]This is safe.
[140:24.10]Oh.
[140:27.78]They're all safe, so you can't fall in here.
[140:30.12]Okay.
[140:35.40]I'm just not even paying attention.
[140:45.92]Hey, what's going on, dudes?
[140:46.98]It's me.
[140:47.50]It's your boy, Jerma.
[140:48.70]It's your guy, your friend.
[140:52.90]Check out what I got today.
[140:54.78]And it goes like... And this is like a zoom in on my face.
[141:01.25]I hope this is not a... Oh, no.
[141:07.47]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[141:08.93]Don't give me like a major storyline boss right now.
[141:14.92]God please not with $4,400 Again we meet I'm normally quite perceptive you I underestimated it though.
[141:25.57]I've since guessed the truth you've seen beyond the kingdom's bounds Don't fight me.
[141:29.45]Please don't fight me Thank God
[141:45.10]Memorial to the Hollow Knight.
[141:47.49]In the black vault far above, though its sacrifice, hollowness lasts eternal.
[141:50.97]Through its sacrifice.
[141:52.85]Black Egg Temple added to map.
[141:57.31]What?
[142:01.69]Oh.
[142:03.02]That's Black Egg Temple, apparently.
[142:05.12]Wait, I have a black egg, don't I?
[142:06.46]I have, like, the rotten egg.
[142:08.88]Maybe the rotten egg's the key.
[142:11.66]There it is.
[142:12.80]Rancid Egg.
[142:15.48]Nice.
[142:17.46]Nice.
[142:18.58]I can't do anything here.
[142:19.36]Can the ground be, like, destroyed?
[142:29.41]I guess that's it.
[142:33.93]Now I can... I don't know.
[142:40.77]Well, sure.
[142:45.39]Sure.
[142:47.83]Okay, up to the mines.
[142:51.42]Go up to the mine area.
[142:52.66]What's the fastest way to get there?
[142:56.62]It was dirt mouth, right?
[143:03.60]Yeah.
[143:04.76]So I got it.
[143:05.33]Where's the stag?
[143:09.71]Maybe I should check that out.
[143:13.52]okay I need to go like up up kind of annoying and where and where is caterpillar grandpa no what are you doing
[143:44.13]Once the map really starts to get large like this is where I start to have overwhelming problems.
[143:51.64]I just have to go left and up.
[143:53.78]And then get to the stag in City of Tears.
[144:00.82]Just gotta go up.
[144:03.07]Right.
[144:04.07]Yes.
[144:05.31]Yes.
[144:16.96]Can't operate elevator.
[144:18.04]I know how to operate an elevator.
[144:20.32]Don't make fun of me like that.
[144:30.39]Stop backseating, Jerma.
[144:31.39]Let him play at his own pace.
[144:34.23]Well, thank you.
[144:36.87]Thank you for that.
[144:40.52]It's okay, though.
[144:46.76]I am enjoying the game at my own pace, so don't worry.
[144:50.86]Everything's fine.
[144:52.92]No one is really backseating very much.
[144:56.42]I kind of just want to damage boost through this guy and not care and just go.
[145:05.41]His own slow, tedious pace?
[145:08.69]Oh, come on!
[145:11.49]Like, how was you a first playthrough?
[145:12.87]Come on, man!
[145:17.56]Like, this is just a first playthrough.
[145:22.22]Something that I don't think I'll ever understand is when people get angry at people for their first playthroughs.
[145:31.67]It's like, yeah, yes, that is true.
[145:33.05]I don't know the thing that... Calm down for a second!
[145:35.41]I need to chill the fuck out right now and pay attention to the game.
[145:40.49]I am not paying attention at all.
[145:46.74]Holy shit, dude.
[145:47.62]Calm down.
[145:48.28]I'm gonna lose all this.
[146:00.40]But people get angry when you don't do the thing you're supposed to do immediately.
[146:06.01]It's like, well, that's because I don't know where to go next.
[146:10.51]I don't know that.
[146:11.29]I didn't play it yet.
[146:12.87]I need to find out where... I need to figure out where to go.
[146:21.24]People get upset.
[146:22.28]I'm not saying anybody here is.
[146:26.68]But... There are people that get very, very, very mad.
[146:30.26]If you don't do, like, the most optimal route.
[146:35.27]And... Like, know where everything is at all times.
[146:40.39]And if you... No, you're not allowed to die either.
[146:41.97]If you die, that means you're bad.
[146:43.25]You know where the bank is?
[146:46.53]Yeah.
[146:48.31]The bank is Queen Station, right?
[146:52.37]And then top left of Queen Station, if I remember.
[146:56.77]Isn't it like over here?
[147:01.07]No, maybe I don't know where it is.
[147:02.25]Well, I want to go to Queen Station anyways.
[147:19.93]I died a lot in this game.
[147:22.64]It's not easy.
[147:28.00]Games like this are not easy.
[147:29.50]They're really not easy.
[147:30.70]Okay, isn't it this way?
[147:41.97]There, it's right there.
[147:45.69]Not saying anybody here is Kappa.
[147:48.39]No, but every so often I will see in the chat, like, wow, what the fuck?
[147:53.17]How the fuck could you have missed like that item?
[147:57.29]It's like, I don't know, man, because I don't... Because I didn't know that that item existed.
[148:03.46]How much should I keep?
[148:04.12]2,000?
[148:04.44]Well, I need 1,800 for the lantern.
[148:05.84]So 1,800.
[148:05.94]Let's put like 1,500 away for now.
[148:13.47]Because I know I need at least 1800.
[148:14.99]And I can spend the other ones somewhere else too.
[148:20.76]There we go.
[148:27.64]Don't deposit all.
[148:28.38]Leave 1800.
[148:28.72]Yeah, I know.
[148:29.80]I want more than 1800.
[148:37.29]Not easy and hard aren't the same thing.
[148:39.79]How do I not have a map for this area?
[148:42.97]What?
[148:45.83]Okay, so I want to go... Where was the guy with the lantern?
[148:49.31]He was back at Dirtmouth, right?
[148:50.81]So let's go back to Queen's Corner, or Queen's Edge, Queen's Station, whatever.
[148:54.59]Let's go to Dirtmouth.
[148:58.73]And let's buy the lantern.
[149:01.19]And continue our quest.
[149:04.33]For glory!
[149:05.03]100% speedrun.
[149:11.96]Hahaha.
[149:16.93]No.
[149:21.81]And here's the thing, like, I've been a culprit of that myself.
[149:25.98]Like, if you play a game through and you know exactly what to do, and you know exactly where to go,
[149:33.46]When you watch somebody play it, and you know exactly what to do, and they're doing the complete opposite thing, you're just kinda sitting there, like, wincing a little, like, I probably should say something, like, dude, you're, like, inch him in the right direction, like, hey, you're just not even close to being in the right spot, like, whatever.
[149:53.41]But I would never call somebody, like, stupid for, like, being in the wrong area.
[149:58.50]I would, like, helpfully nudge them.
[150:02.01]The other way.
[150:03.33]You know?
[150:03.55]Okay, where's this guy?
[150:07.39]That's a shop right here, right?
[150:13.42]Give me that lantern.
[150:17.18]Give me the Lumify lantern.
[150:19.24]Yes.
[150:21.04]Very expensive.
[150:24.58]So... Do I buy...
[150:31.94]Mask shard, or do I buy another key?
[150:34.24]Should I just buy the key?
[150:36.57]Should I buy the key and just open the door that's to the right?
[150:38.91]Does that work in that door?
[150:44.33]I would think so, right?
[150:46.21]Because that would be the second key.
[150:52.55]I have money in the bank still.
[150:53.45]I probably should have just taken it all and just bought everything.
[151:00.17]This is only $500.
[151:03.82]Do I have all the masks?
[151:09.62]No, I need one more piece.
[151:19.15]I could get that too, but no.
[151:24.27]Okay.
[151:27.71]Gathering Swarm is helpful.
[151:30.82]Where's that last piece?
[151:34.95]This person has nothing to sell me, right?
[151:40.69]I'll just buy this warm one just to have it.
[151:46.87]Yeah, this lady doesn't do anything anymore.
[151:51.41]Well, just so I'm not carrying around money, I'm just gonna buy it.
[152:03.28]Just buy them both.
[152:04.84]Fuck it.
[152:05.12]Alright, whatever.
[152:06.50]Just to have them.
[152:08.48]Can I get more notches?
[152:09.52]I think... Probably.
[152:16.57]Let me take a look now.
[152:17.69]Do I love my setup right now?
[152:22.47]I really wish I had another notch.
[152:35.62]Lucky Strike.
[152:36.82]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[152:38.52]Much appreciated.
[152:40.92]Thank you, Lucky Strike.
[152:47.15]This seems pretty useful.
[152:56.77]Oh, yeah, that fat lady.
[152:58.38]The fat notch lady.
[153:00.78]Okay, that's 500.
[153:01.16]Where is that?
[153:05.46]That's where I have problems, is remembering where the hell she is.
[153:07.64]Uh, alright.
[153:12.94]Let's go to... Dirtmouth, right?
[153:15.60]To the right?
[153:16.22]Over here?
[153:17.04]That's where the mines are, right?
[153:19.88]Although, I do want to see what this is now.
[153:21.38]Like, what is this now?
[153:23.58]This huge thing on my map.
[153:28.81]This is a gigantic symbol on my map now.
[153:32.13]I'd like to know what that means.
[153:42.16]Why, has something changed in here?
[153:47.34]Not really.
[153:47.76]It's just a giant indicator on my map.
[153:52.50]Okay.
[154:00.66]Well, in the meantime, let's just go ground pound the mine.
[154:04.18]Let's see where I go.
[154:05.42]Oh, Caterpillar Dad as well.
[154:08.57]Caterpilladad is all the way to the left, right?
[154:11.25]That's Caterpilladad?
[154:12.49]Yeah, it is.
[154:21.04]So I've saved quite a few at this point.
[154:22.78]Let's see what I get.
[154:23.44]One more.
[154:32.24]Alright, here we are.
[154:34.50]What do you got for me?
[154:37.52]Money.
[154:39.33]More money.
[154:41.89]Even more money.
[154:43.13]And by more money, I mean, like, not a lot of money.
[154:45.05]Ooh.
[154:47.23]I see something else.
[154:48.79]Ooh.
[154:51.21]I think that's the last piece, right?
[154:55.70]Something else.
[154:56.04]Oh, this is great.
[154:57.90]Holy crap.
[154:58.98]Okay.
[155:01.29]So, this is the last piece.
[155:03.53]I have completed this.
[155:04.31]There we go.
[155:06.13]What does this do?
[155:09.89]Ah.
[155:11.55]It's another... It's The Legend of Zelda.
[155:15.49]What is this?
[155:16.87]Grub Song.
[155:20.63]Contains the gratitude of free grubs.
[155:22.45]Gains soul when taking damage.
[155:26.80]Nice.
[155:28.71]I filled up my heart.
[155:29.57]Can I do that more than once?
[155:31.11]You can, right?
[155:32.91]Damn.
[155:33.41]Alright, you can.
[155:34.17]Cool.
[155:36.73]Oh, sweet.
[155:37.23]A new computer.
[155:38.11]Cool.
[155:45.11]New Alienware unlocked.
[155:46.27]Now I can play Crysis 2.
[155:47.61]I'm just getting fucking beat up right now.
[155:55.09]Alright, top right.
[155:57.81]Go smash the ground, go to new area, and hope we don't hate ourselves.
[156:06.48]Oh, come on, she opened.
[156:12.60]Cool.
[156:13.28]First big health upgrade.
[156:15.12]I like it.
[156:17.18]Over to the right and down.
[156:18.20]Just move.
[156:19.12]Don't fight anything.
[156:19.74]Who cares?
[156:26.83]Keep going, right?
[156:27.51]Yep.
[156:30.83]Am I still sick?
[156:31.61]I am still not feeling great.
[156:35.76]But I'm alright.
[156:37.72]I'm good enough.
[156:40.94]To continue screaming.
[156:44.58]For at least a little while longer.
[156:47.75]So let me go down.
[156:51.17]Here we are.
[156:51.51]Okay.
[156:52.95]Okay.
[156:56.08]Does this person have any new dialog?
[157:01.72]No.
[157:02.56]Of course they don't.
[157:08.25]You like how the backtracking is simple enough?
[157:11.97]Yeah, I would normally complain about something like this.
[157:15.45]But... It's very unoffensive.
[157:19.07]What was that?
[157:20.97]What is that thing?
[157:27.34]What the hell is this?
[157:28.70]It's an item.
[157:30.64]Another egg.
[157:34.92]Yeah, the backtracking is very... It's very mild.
[157:39.62]Which is a very good thing.
[157:42.47]No map, right?
[157:51.17]Grab some grub.
[157:51.85]I don't know, what do the eggs do?
[157:55.71]Crystal world.
[157:56.39]Let's just go left first.
[157:59.63]The lantern is doing me a lot of favors here, so that's great.
[158:02.83]Thank God I can even see.
[158:03.91]This is... Open it, sure.
[158:06.63]I don't know how this does.
[158:15.86]I feel like this is going to connect to... Yeah, this is going to be where I came out last time, right?
[158:24.15]Yep.
[158:24.51]Forgotten crossroads.
[158:26.87]Crystal Peak.
[158:27.63]So here's your connector.
[158:32.82]This is... I remember I came in here before and it was pitch black in here.
[158:36.88]Well, not anymore.
[158:37.68]A lot of money down here.
[158:54.60]Even more money.
[158:58.72]Can't really have a mines area without there being a lot of mines, right?
[159:08.60]Is that it?
[159:09.12]Is that it?
[159:16.69]Is this connector and that connector?
[159:18.27]Okay, this is weird.
[159:28.84]Okay, here we go.
[159:36.04]Down.
[159:39.28]Let's go down.
[159:39.76]Go buy the other stuff from the store.
[159:40.78]I'll do that after this.
[159:43.21]Once I get to maybe like another boss or stopping point.
[159:45.65]That's cool.
[159:46.79]Barrier belt.
[159:48.25]Can I go down here?
[159:50.43]Not really.
[159:53.23]Wow.
[159:53.99]It's like a super node.
[160:05.20]Anything else new?
[160:06.02]Alright, this area is cool.
[160:16.19]Inverse Jupiter?
[160:21.77]So still no Jerm of fear.
[160:30.12]I'm surprised there's no Jerm of fear yet.
[160:31.42]Uh, let's not go up yet.
[160:41.05]Let's see if there's any... Oh, this is confusing without the map.
[160:48.65]Oh no, I'm losing all that money for the park.
[160:55.57]At this point, it probably won't be till Monday.
[160:56.97]That's kind of sad, but whatever.
[160:58.61]Hey, look at that.
[161:02.14]Hammer brothers.
[161:13.11]Map updated, even though I can't even update it.
[161:19.81]Where you at, man?
[161:27.32]This is... No, I gotta be careful.
[161:29.57]Hold on.
[161:39.29]Another item.
[161:40.89]Another egg.
[161:47.13]Oh, fuck.
[161:47.87]I could've swung down.
[161:52.69]Is he, like, in here somewhere?
[161:56.97]Who the fuck is this guy?
[162:00.45]Like, come on, man.
[162:05.57]Shouldn't he be, like, right here?
[162:06.59]I'm gonna just die.
[162:25.96]Lots of money.
[162:27.28]Who designed all the emotes?
[162:28.08]That would be Blordow.
[162:30.28]Blordow.
[162:32.96]He does all the animation, all the... All the cool stuff you see, artwork-wise.
[162:39.96]With the exception of the Glue Man t-shirt.
[162:42.58]Ow.
[162:42.80]What the fuck?
[162:44.30]It was all done by Blordow.
[162:46.88]Music too.
[162:47.84]All the songs you hear on this stream.
[162:49.42]The intro song, the outro song.
[162:53.44]That was Boydow as well.
[162:56.08]He's a multi-talented person.
[163:00.83]He's a multi-talented man.
[163:02.19]That means he has multiple talents.
[163:12.19]Ow, shit.
[163:15.32]Where's my humming friend?
[163:22.30]Getting back is going to be a pain in the ass.
[163:25.92]Fuck.
[163:34.04]Oh, boy.
[163:34.72]Look at the paper on the ground.
[163:38.92]Yeah, I haven't seen any yet, though.
[163:42.66]Alright, this is some Super Meat Boy shit.
[163:48.72]Wow.
[163:58.70]Jesus, really?
[164:04.12]Damn.
[164:04.56]Alright, don't fuck it up.
[164:07.96]Got it.
[164:09.50]You're free.
[164:14.44]Cool.
[164:15.07]Alright.
[164:21.26]Oh, they have laser beams.
[164:28.02]I can't be hurt.
[164:36.02]Dangerous.
[164:38.31]Oh, please.
[164:44.69]There we go.
[164:45.99]I can see a paper trail.
[164:53.17]Shit.
[164:54.19]Wow.
[165:04.34]Oh, dear.
[165:05.40]Oh, dear.
[165:06.04]Oh.
[165:10.38]Oh.
[165:12.81]That sucked.
[165:15.21]Please, give it to me.
[165:20.51]Purchase the map.
[165:21.29]Yes, please.
[165:21.95]Alright, we can go all the way left.
[165:28.65]We can go up.
[165:29.56]There's a lot of places to go.
[165:31.30]I'm gonna go... I can't go up.
[165:34.86]So, we're not going up.
[165:36.52]I'm gonna go left.
[165:38.82]I don't think we're going left either.
[165:41.76]No, we're not.
[165:44.54]We are not.
[165:45.06]But I'm actually gonna go to the bathroom.
[165:46.54]If I get to use my new thing.
[165:52.08]So give me one second.
[165:52.84]I'm going to use the bathroom.
[165:53.74]I'm going to go pee.
[165:54.42]I'll be right back.
[165:55.08]And we'll continue.
[165:56.09]Be right back.
[166:23.97]Yeah.
[166:24.57]Yeah.
[166:53.91]Hmm, hmm, hmm.
[167:38.80]Thank you.
[168:16.98]Thank you.
[168:46.97]Thank you.
[169:16.29]Wait, what happened?
[169:17.63]I forgot to loop it.
[169:23.28]You guys are sitting at a black screen.
[169:26.00]I'm just streaming a black screen.
[169:33.82]Yeah, well, I just put this into OBS, so that's a good reminder that I need to loop it.
[169:48.42]How great is that screen, though?
[169:52.16]I love this screen so much.
[169:53.28]Alright.
[169:57.90]Well, let's go back.
[170:00.98]We haven't died, right?
[170:01.95]Good.
[170:05.99]We have not died yet.
[170:14.95]Alright.
[170:15.89]Alright.
[170:16.35]Hey, guys, I'm a streamer.
[170:17.05]I have nothing to say when I come back from like... Alright.
[170:20.95]Alright.
[170:21.97]Alright.
[170:24.74]For real, alright.
[170:26.98]Right.
[170:28.16]Can't go up, can't go left.
[170:28.96]We're going to go up.
[170:35.80]Yes, we are.
[170:41.26]I already hate these things.
[170:42.32]I haven't even played them for more than like five seconds, but I hate them already.
[170:54.33]This really is Meat Boy.
[170:55.57]Totally.
[170:58.05]Oh, it's like the goofy face.
[171:01.41]I don't even know what goofy face means.
[171:08.88]Oh, shit.
[171:10.56]Oh, great.
[171:12.74]It's just a mini-boss.
[171:13.56]What?
[171:16.44]Don't die.
[171:19.22]Somebody just gave... That image is going to be a lot bigger.
[171:22.18]Don't worry.
[171:31.59]Somebody gave 50 bucks.
[171:33.55]I'll talk to you in a second.
[171:35.03]Give me one second.
[171:41.41]Why did I just fucking dash into this guy?
[171:43.92]That was really stupid.
[171:54.43]Shit, I just got so greedy.
[171:57.09]I'm still so greedy.
[172:10.06]No fair, dude.
[172:18.19]Will you die already?
[172:21.09]Thank you, jeez.
[172:25.03]Wait, he's not dead?
[172:28.99]Well, whatever.
[172:33.03]Mr. Freeze.
[172:35.37]Alright, Lucky Strike.
[172:37.85]Lucky Strike gave 50 bucks.
[172:41.07]And 20 minutes ago, they gave 10 bucks.
[172:43.82]They do not have a message.
[172:45.00]They just gave $60.
[172:45.98]Thank you, Lucky Strike.
[172:49.66]Appreciate it, dude.
[172:55.60]Lucky Strike.
[172:58.20]Hmm, can't go up.
[173:03.67]I need a better nail.
[173:04.55]Don't I already have a nail upgrade?
[173:07.87]Oh, that's a bench!
[173:09.93]That's a bench!
[173:11.39]I thought that was a funny guy's face with a hat on!
[173:13.63]That doesn't look- That's a funny face with a hat on!
[173:18.53]It's a fucking bench!
[173:24.94]Okay, now I get it.
[173:26.62]Now I get it.
[173:30.38]I'm looking for like the funny guy, and there's no guy.
[173:36.90]50 plus 20 is 60.
[173:43.55]You guys don't see that?
[173:47.75]Oh, come on.
[173:48.39]Really?
[173:51.17]Yeah, it really is just jermaEarth with a hat on.
[173:58.86]That's not a bench.
[174:00.87]That's jermaEarth.
[174:03.10]Wait a second.
[174:03.98]Oh, for real.
[174:05.80]For fucking real.
[174:07.82]I gotta reload this area.
[174:11.13]Take a fucking picture of that.
[174:15.01]That's jermaEarth.
[174:31.04]It just needs a funny hat.
[174:32.70]That's all it needs.
[174:42.57]I fucking love this.
[174:48.85]What the fuck, man?
[174:52.37]Okay, let's go.
[174:54.67]Where do I go now?
[175:00.04]Get out of here.
[175:02.85]Get out of here, you little bug bastard.
[175:08.77]jermaEarth Hat.
[175:10.23]Just use my last emote slot on that.
[175:16.81]You don't see that?
[175:18.45]Oh man, come on.
[175:24.83]Son of a gun.
[175:25.65]This is like... Oh boy.
[175:28.39]Now I get to do like the... Thank god I didn't get hit by that.
[175:37.79]This is all for my little friend.
[175:39.19]Let's get the pattern here.
[175:39.97]Two, one, two.
[175:43.49]Got it.
[175:45.81]Back home with you.
[175:50.03]But I might have missed something.
[175:55.37]I did miss something.
[175:56.62]This way.
[176:00.34]Now we're back here.
[176:03.60]I guess we have to go down to the right.
[176:06.22]I guess.
[176:10.54]I think so.
[176:11.74]That's what I would do.
[176:13.84]I really hope I'm not missing... I hope I didn't miss something.
[176:25.97]Fuck me.
[176:31.91]Fuck me.
[176:32.35]You know what I mean?
[176:33.25]Fuck me.
[176:40.77]Fuck me!
[176:49.42]I really like this game, by the way.
[176:51.58]If you guys didn't know.
[176:54.58]Is this the 100% completion run?
[176:56.22]Hey, by the way, that's Etalyx.
[176:58.86]Everybody welcome Etalyx.
[177:02.41]Everybody go, yo, Etalyx, what's up?
[177:04.57]Make sure you give him a follow.
[177:05.55]That's Etalyx with an E.
[177:09.14]Not with a D. Don't spell it with a D. Ah, shit.
[177:17.15]We finally have the lantern, so we can do this now.
[177:19.53]Good.
[177:21.95]Hey, can you hear me now?
[177:23.09]Good!
[177:29.61]I hear twinkling.
[177:44.23]Is that twinkling just part of the map?
[177:45.50]Or is there actually an item in here?
[177:53.74]Hmm.
[177:55.88]Hmm.
[178:01.33]Okay.
[178:03.77]What the hell is this?
[178:06.71]Who the hell am I?
[178:09.96]Curse those who turn against the king.
[178:12.52]God.
[178:13.99]Where the fuck did I just end up?
[178:15.05]Oh.
[178:23.45]Oh dear.
[178:25.85]Oh dear.
[178:27.77]Oh dear.
[178:29.93]Cut scene.
[178:31.05]To protect the vessel, the dreamers lay sleeping.
[178:34.27]Monomon, the teacher, in her archive, surrounded by fog and mist.
[178:38.37]Lorian, the watcher, in his spire, looking over the city.
[178:41.41]Hera, the beast, in her den, amidst the deep darkness beyond the kingdom.
[178:46.11]Through their devotion, Hallownest is eternal.
[178:51.65]So these are like the three major bosses, I would assume.
[178:57.97]Go no further, little shadow.
[178:59.25]What compels its climb out of the darkness?
[179:00.91]What compels its return to the sacred kingdom?
[179:04.39]I call from beyond the seals.
[179:05.83]By the vessel or by that captive light.
[179:08.01]When the seals break, they cannot be undone.
[179:10.05]But the vessel weakens.
[179:11.27]That plague springs anew.
[179:12.31]They must be undone.
[179:13.93]If I was a voice actor, I would be the cheapest, like, $8 voice actor there ever was.
[179:18.49]Yet still our seals remain our duty holds.
[179:20.69]They must be cast away.
[179:21.59]The duty holds shall be done.
[179:27.78]The lion, the witch, and the wardrobe.
[179:31.12]The three biggest bosses.
[179:33.58]Oh, that's too bright.
[179:39.49]Now where am I?
[179:39.91]What the hell is this?
[179:44.67]Whoa, secrets.
[179:45.57]Whoa, secrets!
[179:55.20]Follow the magic butterfly.
[179:56.38]You got it.
[180:05.04]Now what?
[180:05.56]It's very loud.
[180:14.28]Keep going.
[180:15.14]This is really cool.
[180:17.62]What's down here?
[180:19.55]You wouldn't put one down here for no reason, right?
[180:30.29]Okay.
[180:34.70]Okay.
[180:36.00]Do I have to fight the butterfly at the end of this?
[180:40.22]Hey, Gummy Monk, thanks for the 15 bucks.
[180:41.64]Just got here.
[180:42.32]How's the stomach?
[180:43.28]New emotes are in need.
[180:44.24]Yeah, I'm still waiting for one to process.
[180:47.98]But, thank you.
[180:48.58]Much appreciated for the 15 dollars.
[180:50.52]And this... I feel like I'm... Should listen to what this person has to say.
[180:56.96]What a terrible fate they've visited upon you, to cast you away into the space beyond body and soul, between.
[181:02.61]Will you accept their judgment and fade slowly away, or will you take the weapon before you and cut your way out of this sad forgotten dream?
[181:11.83]Do I have a new ability?
[181:14.58]New weapon?
[181:16.16]Lollipop?
[181:22.32]Taking the dream nail!
[181:24.74]New weapon.
[181:26.47]Hold triangle to charge and slash with a nail.
[181:28.93]Cut through the veil between dreams and waking.
[181:35.01]Okay.
[181:39.03]Thank goodness this bug grandmother gave me a bunch of like poison tea.
[181:42.32]So...
[181:52.30]Well, that's a... That's a large charge up time.
[181:55.20]I'm gonna have to... Okay.
[181:56.56]Okay.
[182:08.66]But that talisman you now wield, the dream nail, it can cut through the veil that separates the waking world from our dreams.
[182:14.60]Even the dreamers themselves cannot hide from such a weapon.
[182:17.76]I gotta admit, that sacred blade has dulled over time.
[182:20.81]Together, perhaps, we can restore its power.
[182:22.29]You only have to bring me essence.
[182:25.15]Prescience.
[182:25.99]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[182:27.41]Once we have enough essence, we can work together.
[182:29.47]Go out, wielder.
[182:30.11]Hunt down the essence that lingers there.
[182:31.63]Collect a hundred essence and return to me.
[182:33.15]I will teach you more.
[182:41.25]Oh, God.
[182:46.69]I thought I just killed her.
[182:52.14]So, do dreams take root?
[182:57.22]I knew it.
[182:58.08]I knew it.
[182:58.70]I knew those things.
[182:59.46]I knew those fucking weird orange peel things.
[183:04.72]Yep, I knew it.
[183:06.23]I told you guys.
[183:06.79]Remember I said this?
[183:07.97]That these things were too weird looking?
[183:09.23]That they weren't, um...
[183:12.97]Wait, how do I get it?
[183:13.51]Yeah, those orange peel things are everywhere.
[183:19.11]Is that it?
[183:21.99]Is there any more?
[183:23.87]That's what each one gives you.
[183:28.82]I'm going to assume like 10.
[183:32.22]More than that, apparently.
[183:38.36]One of those trees gives you a lot.
[183:45.93]Is there more?
[183:49.80]Why can I not ground pound this?
[183:50.74]I don't have any essence.
[183:52.88]I don't have any shit.
[183:56.52]Is that it?
[183:57.68]19.
[183:57.70]That's a weird, odd number.
[184:04.78]What did I miss?
[184:05.32]Oh, there it is.
[184:08.10]Okay, 20.
[184:11.82]Cool.
[184:11.98]Alright, now I ground pound...
[184:15.07]Oh dear.
[184:24.30]What is this?
[184:26.68]Ugh!
[184:28.38]Where the hell have I gone?
[184:35.23]I hear a bug.
[184:41.57]You're a caterpillar.
[184:47.45]Hell is where's this?
[184:48.85]What is this?
[184:49.33]Where am I?
[184:50.11]Fuck am I I'm in a city of tears again Look at how far away I am
[185:16.96]Alright, we just have like a Binding of Isaac shithead enemy.
[185:19.98]Okay.
[185:23.16]City of Tears seems to be huge.
[185:28.19]Okay, the one enemy that runs away is the one that hurts me.
[185:30.71]Really?
[185:35.33]Oh, hold on.
[185:38.13]Let's go up.
[185:42.80]Really?
[185:43.44]You fucking humpty dumpty little shit.
[185:45.28]Get out of here.
[185:54.71]That's all that does.
[185:55.63]Okay.
[186:04.96]You want my Geo?
[186:08.42]Stay back.
[186:08.84]I'm gonna read their minds.
[186:13.30]There's a lot of fucking people in here.
[186:14.59]You're just all dead.
[186:15.75]Just kill them all.
[186:22.03]Kill.
[186:23.07]I can read their thoughts.
[186:24.15]I'm pretty much just doing tell.
[186:25.17]Okay.
[186:27.89]Easy enough.
[186:34.27]Shit.
[186:35.13]No, this is not good.
[186:42.98]Fuck, you just spawned right on top of me.
[186:47.16]That was not fair.
[186:47.84]You guys know it.
[186:52.90]That shit wasn't fair.
[186:53.90]Oh, fuck off.
[187:09.25]Damn.
[187:10.75]That was actually pretty difficult.
[187:15.31]Oh, another piece of this egg.
[187:22.87]Worth it, apparently, yeah.
[187:24.47]I'd say so.
[187:30.26]Okay.
[187:36.32]That's so far away right now.
[187:38.03]Damn.
[187:39.11]I'm so far gone.
[187:45.33]Just go down, I guess?
[187:49.63]That was a real roguelike room?
[187:51.05]Yeah, it was.
[187:52.03]That was very much a roguelike.
[187:56.25]Wish I could see anything.
[188:04.06]Down.
[188:09.70]Yes.
[188:12.12]No, I want to go down.
[188:13.28]Go down!
[188:13.66]Oh my god.
[188:16.27]Like, really.
[188:17.77]You really gotta cut the shit with this.
[188:23.21]I'm, like, locked in here.
[188:27.13]The George Washingtons.
[188:28.33]Okay, that's fine.
[188:40.01]Have I bought anything yet?
[188:41.41]Oh, I spent a lot of money.
[188:43.39]I'm not sure this is the right way.
[188:51.39]King's Station.
[188:54.50]Queen Station.
[188:55.22]That was a King Station.
[189:00.13]Thank God.
[189:00.57]I can actually see what the hell I'm doing.
[189:05.05]Ooh, stag.
[189:06.27]Perfect.
[189:08.99]I'm so happy to see this.
[189:24.23]All the powering up and guessing the DBZ joke has been made.
[189:27.57]It has.
[189:28.31]Well, I don't need you right now.
[189:29.33]Because I want to keep looking around what's here.
[189:56.55]Yes, I want to go down to the right.
[190:03.14]Can't get in there.
[190:05.80]Can I break the ground over here?
[190:07.38]Might as well see.
[190:08.14]No.
[190:11.33]Oh well.
[190:14.21]What's over here?
[190:14.71]Uh oh.
[190:19.51]Uh oh.
[190:21.99]Broken down.
[190:30.31]Well, there's that.
[190:32.65]That little hole.
[190:33.45]Be free.
[190:40.23]Read the bug's mind.
[190:40.99]Yeah, I can do that.
[190:41.59]This is a new area.
[190:51.33]Ah, damn.
[190:51.99]This is Kingdom's Edge.
[190:53.71]Fuck.
[190:55.43]It's so expansive.
[190:57.59]It's so expansive, guys.
[191:04.28]It's too expensive.
[191:09.91]This is crazy.
[191:12.77]Well, at least I know that's over here.
[191:14.29]Let's read this guy's mind.
[191:17.07]What do you say?
[191:20.89]Come here.
[191:21.11]I want to read your thoughts.
[191:24.57]Come on, closer.
[191:27.15]Closer.
[191:31.05]I want to read your mind.
[191:34.91]Come on!
[191:35.59]I gotta... Okay, hold on.
[191:36.87]I'm gonna bring him down.
[191:38.77]No, I'm just going to... He's gonna die.
[191:42.13]Alright.
[191:52.41]All this for $15?
[191:53.51]Yeah.
[191:56.31]Yep.
[191:56.99]That's right.
[191:58.59]This shit is $15. $15.
[192:04.14]I can't do anything here.
[192:08.86]I can't believe this is $15.
[192:14.01]I don't believe that.
[192:16.11]Why?
[192:16.35]This is very clearly like a $40 game.
[192:24.07]You know?
[192:24.61]That's amazing.
[192:27.85]I have nothing but good things to say about this so far.
[192:30.45]This is crazy.
[192:31.51]It's extremely expansive.
[192:34.08]There's a lot of stuff to do.
[192:37.96]Like, I'm not even, like, what?
[192:39.48]Like, 10% of the way through the game?
[192:40.80]Like, 20%?
[192:41.00]What is what?
[192:42.06]There's 30 bosses?
[192:42.90]I've killed, what, like, 7?
[192:43.92]There's all this already.
[192:49.14]All this already?
[192:50.34]This is already, like, a $20 game.
[192:54.68]Already.
[192:56.86]It's very, very, very, very fair for the content you get.
[193:02.47]Highly, highly recommend you buy this game.
[193:05.65]If you like these kinds of things, please get this game.
[193:14.14]Give one negative.
[193:16.18]Okay, I will give you a negative.
[193:18.96]I've said it a few times.
[193:20.26]I'm not, like, a gigantic fan of the whole, um, get the map for the area.
[193:28.64]I know it's, like, cool and it's, like, nostalgia, it's old school, but I don't know.
[193:32.86]I'd rather just fucking see it as we go, be able to see it, you know?
[193:37.20]So that's, like, the one real complaint I think I have about the game.
[193:41.20]But that's barely a complaint.
[193:42.47]It's not, like, a personal preference thing.
[194:00.63]Holy shit, this guy hurts.
[194:05.49]I'm gonna get you with that and you'll probably die if I do that.
[194:08.51]We're gonna make our way to the left here, I guess.
[194:24.21]Also, the compass, this system... I'm gonna give you another negative here.
[194:30.07]Hold on, there's another huge guy.
[194:31.31]I'm gonna get a safe place.
[194:33.63]The only other negative I can think of is... They have so many really cool combinations here.
[194:40.92]There's a dozen combinations I could probably think of just with these.
[194:46.49]I kind of just wish they didn't have costs.
[194:51.49]I kind of just wish they were all worth like two.
[194:54.98]Or like two or one.
[194:56.66]I think three costs for anything, it just kind of makes it a little too difficult to take anything off.
[195:04.04]Because for me, I find this is a must-have for a lot of people.
[195:08.86]This is a must-have for a lot of people.
[195:11.98]I would really like to see this give me the freedom to put different combinations on and not have to worry about the notches.
[195:18.84]I know I can buy more notches, but I just think that doesn't need to be there, I don't think.
[195:25.96]I think just having the maximum amount of notches is more fun to play with because you have to wait until you buy the notches to be able to do this.
[195:35.19]Like, maybe I'd rather see them tone down some of these stronger ones to make it, like, at least the early game a little more interesting.
[195:42.59]Not even really a complaint, because, like, I don't mind, but that's the only other thing I can think of, that I've kind of just been pigeonholed for the first, like, six hours, seven hours of the game.
[195:52.12]Because I needed, what, 20, let's see, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, I needed 10 charms to be able to buy a new notch, right?
[196:05.02]Not even a complaint, really.
[196:06.26]I'm just like, I'm really trying to think of things that I don't like.
[196:10.06]And that's not even, I don't, I don't even mind.
[196:13.04]It's like not even a big deal.
[196:15.59]But if you made me have to give you another thing that I thought was like, oh, I wish I could maybe do it a little differently.
[196:20.41]It'd be that.
[196:21.57]That's all though.
[196:26.33]What's like the effective way to deal with these guys?
[196:28.35]I'm not entirely sure.
[196:29.33]Oh, shit.
[196:33.03]Okay, beep.
[196:35.74]I'm gonna die here.
[196:36.48]Where's my nearest bench?
[196:40.16]Well, this is... Alright, we're going here.
[196:46.95]Shit.
[196:49.73]I really don't want to fucking die.
[196:58.83]Where am I going?
[197:01.14]Oh, God.
[197:02.12]Oh, God.
[197:04.34]Don't even go for the money.
[197:06.83]You're going to throw this at me right now?
[197:08.24]I'm doing like dog noises.
[197:17.74]Oh.
[197:19.24]Oh.
[197:25.80]What is this?
[197:30.86]Another area?
[197:32.92]Another area?
[197:33.98]Come on.
[197:35.29]Give me some...
[197:39.46]Ugh!
[197:41.04]Damn.
[197:42.22]I need to bait this guy over here, and then, like, heal, but just don't get hit, please?
[197:46.50]Sir!
[197:51.91]Fuck.
[197:55.65]We're fine.
[197:56.17]Okay, we're good.
[197:57.11]Oof.
[198:06.03]Whatever, fuck you.
[198:11.26]I need to get to, like, solid ground.
[198:15.70]Fuck my... Fuck!
[198:20.71]This is too many areas!
[198:22.99]I keep stumbling upon new places!
[198:28.19]That's like the fourth new area I've found in the last fucking five, ten minutes!
[198:32.50]Like, come on!
[198:33.22]Let me pop a squat somewhere.
[198:35.36]Fuck!
[198:43.07]Goddamn!
[198:46.53]These huge guys, too.
[198:47.77]You know what?
[198:48.13]I'll read his mind.
[198:49.29]What are you, hungry?
[198:56.11]What's wrong with you?
[198:57.05]Not welcome.
[198:57.72]Kill.
[198:58.02]Alright, well, I don't care.
[199:05.76]Secret gamer guide.
[199:06.72]I keep just running into new places.
[199:13.15]What movie am I going to spoil now?
[199:16.30]Good question.
[199:16.78]Let me think of a movie while I lose to this regular enemy.
[199:27.28]In All Dogs Go to Heaven, the main character... I don't care.
[199:31.90]Just pretend I made a joke.
[199:38.53]God damn it.
[199:39.77]I don't want to do this whole fucking thing again.
[199:51.89]At least I have four hits.
[199:52.87]This is such an awful place to fight these flying enemies.
[199:58.74]Get over here.
[199:59.34]Dickhead.
[200:15.05]Come over here.
[200:16.50]Come here!
[200:21.08]Now you're gonna do it?
[200:22.22]Now you're gonna do that shit to me?
[200:24.46]Come on.
[200:25.26]Fuck these enemies here.
[200:26.18]It's not fair.
[200:27.90]I am gonna scream in a second.
[200:30.25]I really am.
[200:30.99]You're gonna- And now he's back.
[200:36.71]Why did he not- Did I get it back?
[200:42.66]Why did he take more than one- Two hits?
[200:44.64]What the fuck?
[200:47.48]I hit him twice, why did he not explode?
[200:49.86]What the fuck was that shit?
[200:54.06]That was fucking stupid.
[200:56.16]I hit him twice, he didn't explode.
[200:59.52]That's what threw me off.
[201:00.86]I hit my thing twice.
[201:02.80]He's died every single time with two hits.
[201:08.22]God, fuck that area.
[201:09.46]Fuck those enemies in that area.
[201:10.99]That's bullshit.
[201:12.33]Alright, you want something else I complain about?
[201:13.83]That.
[201:14.53]That sucks, asshole.
[201:27.81]Shadow gets more health when you get more health.
[201:30.37]What?
[201:32.25]A full another swing of my sword?
[201:33.93]Well, that's bullshit.
[201:36.01]That is total dog shit.
[201:42.52]I got one extra little capsule, and you mean I gotta hit him a third fucking time?
[201:45.92]Oh, by the way, in Mission Impossible...
[201:56.88]Tom Cruise.
[201:58.20]That fucking general in the very beginning.
[202:00.60]The guy that takes off the mask.
[202:04.46]Hold on a second.
[202:05.12]Let me deal with the fucking shittiest area in the whole game.
[202:07.94]Give me one second.
[202:09.89]I'm so mad that I can't even play.
[202:11.37]I fucking hate this so much that I can't even play the game.
[202:17.73]I fucking despise this.
[202:19.23]This is the shittiest place in the whole game.
[202:21.03]Even though it's not even hard.
[202:22.33]I fucking hate this.
[202:28.68]I fucking hate this place.
[202:35.27]So yeah, in the movie Speed, guess what?
[202:37.89]Everything's fine.
[202:39.87]They end up going below 50 miles per hour.
[202:41.93]And the bus doesn't... Nothing happens.
[202:43.77]It's fine.
[202:50.06]Fucking dumbass place.
[202:52.16]The stupid flying bugs that you can't go near.
[202:54.32]Because they just stand above you and throw the spears.
[202:56.58]And they never fly at you.
[203:00.32]I lost all that money because I didn't know I had to swing him a third time.
[203:05.78]Legitimately for the fucking 11 hours of this game I've had to hit that thing twice.
[203:10.25]And now all of a sudden I don't because I got like an extra fucking Zelda capsule.
[203:16.27]Pain in my ass.
[203:20.27]Can't go here?
[203:22.18]Okay.
[203:24.42]I'm so lost too.
[203:25.46]Like I just don't even know where the fuck I need to go.
[203:34.11]It's going down.
[203:34.67]Where am I even going?
[203:40.88]This is... Ancient Basin.
[203:43.08]Okay, we're like... We made it to the Ancient Basin, guys.
[203:48.58]I should not be here.
[203:50.90]At all.
[203:58.26]I just want to fight like the... Wait, okay, hold on.
[204:00.94]Where is he?
[204:04.03]I don't have enough.
[204:05.41]I probably don't have enough.
[204:07.45]Please have it be, like, less than... Whatever.
[204:18.42]Alright, remember where that guy is.
[204:27.29]Because I won't.
[204:43.63]No, none of those toll machine No, but that's a bench isn't it?
[204:49.42]Oh shit Why did I have to die at that stupid fucking spot?
[204:56.50]Ah Like how fucking annoying What is this?
[205:04.37]Like I'm just on tilt and everything is angering me right now.
[205:07.75]Oh
[205:12.11]Because I lost every fucking cent I had.
[205:13.73]And I would say it again, but I'm not going to.
[205:18.05]The third fucking swing that I had no fucking idea.
[205:21.74]Oh, I said it again.
[205:23.34]I didn't want to say it again, but I just did.
[205:38.07]Just give me the map.
[205:39.81]Don't really need to kill these little pukes for the next, like, 25 minutes.
[206:01.41]I still do if I have money in the bank, but that's so far away.
[206:04.49]And to be completely honest, because there's no map, my one complaint of the game, I have no fucking idea how to even get back there.
[206:12.18]I don't have a clue.
[206:19.62]I'm just gonna have to do this until I can get the map.
[206:21.74]I don't even know what this is.
[206:30.56]Drop all Geo into the fountain.
[206:33.38]Why would I do this?
[206:35.24]I just did it.
[206:35.70]Why did I do that?
[206:42.27]What?
[206:44.13]Oh, wait, wait, hold on a second.
[206:45.07]Here comes... Hold on, wait, this is important.
[206:46.93]This is important.
[206:49.41]Here comes the fucking Biaz.
[206:50.81]Here comes the Bia-Konga line.
[206:53.70]What, is that a clown car?
[206:55.30]Did somebody get hit by a clown car?
[207:02.85]This is exactly what I wanted!
[207:05.27]The fucking Bia Conga line!
[207:09.45]I can't wait to add audio to this.
[207:10.89]That was awesome.
[207:20.70]I love how it just still says, alright.
[207:27.03]Alright!
[207:31.05]Thank you, Lucky Strike.
[207:34.34]Thank you so much for the 100 bucks.
[207:35.62]Yeah, I'm going to put in some audio for that.
[207:46.13]I just crashed your stream.
[207:50.37]I guess I can't use this yet.
[207:51.51]And that was a huge mistake, but it's okay.
[207:54.69]Lucky Strike says, favorite streamer.
[207:56.53]Love you.
[207:58.24]Well, lucky strike.
[208:00.58]Thank you for the more than $100 you've given.
[208:04.26]You've given, like, almost $200 today.
[208:08.04]So, maybe even more than that.
[208:11.58]So, I'm extremely humbled to be your favorite streamer.
[208:15.22]Thank you.
[208:18.40]So, now what?
[208:20.40]Down?
[208:20.66]Yeah, we gotta, like, shake the salt here.
[208:26.72]I don't even know who you are.
[208:28.81]Come on, you little spider.
[208:29.93]Alright, you do the same thing as the guy from downstairs.
[208:32.35]There we go.
[208:37.09]I hear a beetle.
[208:38.82]Somewhere.
[208:39.20]Oh, there we go.
[208:45.04]You have much larger reach, though.
[209:02.21]Something tells me I should go back to the other area.
[209:09.80]Maybe.
[209:16.80]I feel like I've been doing a lot of exploring and finding a ton of areas, but I've only fought like, what, two bosses in three hours, four hours?
[209:26.27]I feel like I should be running into more.
[209:27.58]I guess I'm just like not at the right place at the right time for these bosses.
[209:31.96]Because I've only fought like two, right?
[209:34.14]Or three?
[209:39.20]Yeah.
[209:49.02]God.
[209:55.92]I'm gonna say this one more time.
[209:58.00]Fuck off.
[209:58.56]Where am I?
[210:00.64]Where am I?
[210:13.74]I'm going to the bank.
[210:19.49]I'm going to fucking... Fuck this.
[210:27.81]Found a secret.
[210:31.14]I guess I found a fucking secret down there.
[210:33.44]I got, like, stuck off the map and then got hit by a pustule and died.
[210:40.04]Stream over.
[210:42.50]No, I have to... I have to, like... Well, I know it's down all the way lower left, but what's, like... I don't know.
[210:52.71]I'm so overwhelmed right now.
[210:54.29]That's the one... I have a problem sometimes.
[210:58.71]When I'm given like five different options of where I can go... I get so overwhelmed and I just don't know what to do.
[211:07.41]Because I don't know what the correct thing to do is.
[211:09.66]Because there's at least like five places I can go.
[211:14.98]And I guess like the answer to that is nothing is correct, right?
[211:17.88]You can kind of just go wherever you want, right?
[211:19.67]Something like that.
[211:21.47]But I have to kill these guys.
[211:22.73]I just like have to.
[211:34.25]Make the game more linear?
[211:35.09]No, no, that's not what I'm saying.
[211:36.59]I'm just saying I personally get so lost.
[211:39.76]Caught in my own feelings.
[211:41.00]Please die.
[211:50.36]I'm about to have a fucking meltdown.
[212:04.53]Does this guy have more health?
[212:05.70]Did something happen?
[212:06.42]Did I get like fucking two times health on this guy?
[212:10.98]Why does it feel like this guy's taking a thousand more hits than he usually does?
[212:28.35]Did I hit that guy like ten times more times than I hit him last time?
[212:33.25]I don't get it.
[212:39.05]I beat that guy in way less hits last time.
[212:41.99]What the fuck?
[212:46.77]I might need to take a break.
[212:50.43]I might have to take a break.
[212:51.73]I'm at that stage right now where, like, the third swing on my ghost pissed me off so much that I can't even exist as a person right now.
[213:02.36]Like, that is still making me angry.
[213:04.08]Like, months later.
[213:05.02]You know what I mean?
[213:06.46]I might have to take a break.
[213:10.88]You like how I don't die literally for three hours and die five?
[213:13.80]It's because I can't even function as a human being right now.
[213:21.89]You know what I'm saying?
[213:22.47]Like, it's hard for me to even exist, right?
[213:24.35]I'm just so angry at that third hit on the ghost.
[213:41.24]Play something with the PS Move controls.
[213:42.70]I'll probably get even more angry playing with the PS Move.
[213:49.59]No, I need to get down there.
[213:50.97]I need to get... I just need to buy the map for Ancient Basin.
[213:57.95]Just, like, give me the map.
[213:58.89]You know what I mean?
[214:00.49]Give me the fucking map.
[214:06.37]I'm not even fighting this thing.
[214:08.41]No, I'll just get hit by his fucking 50 yards range.
[214:14.07]Just go.
[214:14.47]I need to go down.
[214:21.95]Like, why do I have to pay for the map?
[214:25.47]Want another complaint?
[214:27.81]Why do I have to buy the map?
[214:30.65]Just give it to me.
[214:31.81]I don't care if I have to find the fucking guy.
[214:33.29]Just give it to me.
[214:34.97]I already- I'm already there.
[214:41.78]It's such a minuscule shit amount of geo.
[214:43.98]Like, why even have it in the game?
[214:52.80]Rage gamer.
[214:58.58]Take a Brazilian VR break.
[215:01.34]Well, this brings me over here.
[215:05.36]At least I can do this.
[215:09.63]Yeah, I can already tell.
[215:10.35]Like, I've gotten hit more times in the last 20 minutes than I have in 12 hours streaming this game.
[215:16.17]That's how you know I'm, like, ready to pop.
[215:21.35]Whatever.
[215:21.65]What is that?
[215:29.37]Um... Let's go up.
[215:31.09]Where does this even go?
[215:31.77]I don't know.
[215:36.91]Huh?
[215:51.04]If I could ground pound that, if I had any juice or whatever.
[215:54.18]Am I going to stream this more?
[215:56.48]Yes.
[216:00.95]I will be streaming this more.
[216:04.43]Because, believe it or not, I am heavily enjoying this game.
[216:10.44]I just have to get to the bottom now.
[216:11.50]Just don't die here like a fucking dummy.
[216:14.46]Don't be a dummy.
[216:29.65]You're almost there.
[216:31.11]Just buy the map.
[216:36.22]Okay.
[216:38.54]No.
[216:39.50]Okay, remember this area.
[216:41.52]Don't hate it.
[216:42.72]Don't even worry.
[216:43.38]Just go.
[216:47.58]What you should have done in the very beginning is that.
[216:49.68]Fuck fighting anything here.
[216:52.92]Just go.
[216:56.40]Mr. Map Guy was like this way, right?
[216:58.26]I don't even know.
[217:00.46]Who knows?
[217:00.88]He could be anywhere.
[217:12.23]Get some money.
[217:12.87]Fuck.
[217:20.01]Okay.
[217:23.85]Let's go.
[217:32.38]Buying the map.
[217:33.86]And then I may or may not take a break.
[217:36.44]It depends.
[217:36.94]Depends on how expansive this place is.
[217:48.90]He's down here, right?
[217:50.26]Or is he up?
[217:51.34]He's down.
[217:55.31]Give me the map, you godforsaken creature.
[217:58.27]Wait, Metallics, what the hell are you talking about?
[218:11.82]Metallics, what the fuck are you talking about?
[218:18.33]Did Etalyx' account just get, like, hacked?
[218:22.07]What the fuck is he saying?
[218:23.19]I'm trying to head down and hit square.
[218:37.03]How much is this?
[218:37.55]150.
[218:38.49]God damn it.
[218:41.79]So close.
[218:52.18]It's to the right.
[218:58.52]Can't go that way.
[218:59.20]Can I just go down?
[219:00.02]Okay, we can go down.
[219:08.38]I desperately need that bench.
[219:09.98]I really badly need that.
[219:17.71]I'm gonna get that bench unlocked and I might call it for tonight.
[219:20.43]Oh, Jesus.
[219:25.12]One pure vessel has ascended beyond lies, only the refuse and regret of its creation.
[219:29.74]We shall enter that place no longer.
[219:31.10]Okay, well this is an area that I can't access yet.
[219:45.27]play that?
[219:46.53]What the hell are you guys doing?
[219:53.81]Um... I need 150.
[219:54.27]I wish there was a bank in more than one spot.
[220:02.78]That kind of stinks that there isn't.
[220:05.44]I don't think I can even go over there.
[220:10.74]Um...
[220:15.02]Down or left, but I mean, where the hell am I supposed to go?
[220:24.01]That's just a connector.
[220:27.48]Kingdom's Edge, Royal Waterways, Deepnest.
[220:30.54]I guess I could go to Deepnest, I guess.
[220:32.52]I kind of have no idea.
[220:36.11]And by kind of, I mean I do not have any idea.
[220:47.88]I hope this was worth doing.
[220:48.90]I really hope there's something at the end of this, otherwise this is a very bad idea.
[220:58.09]Thank goodness it was a good idea.
[220:59.85]Just gonna stand right here.
[221:05.61]Almost there.
[221:10.19]Shit.
[221:18.46]I'm not sure I can get up there.
[221:19.58]I guess I could try a dash.
[221:32.27]No.
[221:35.06]I guess not.
[221:35.72]I don't think I can do that yet.
[221:41.42]Fuck, I'm close.
[221:48.51]Leather Jacket with $5.
[221:51.11]Thank you, Leather Jacket.
[221:51.77]I've been told we have fancy animations.
[221:55.10]They are very fancy.
[221:56.42]They're new and fancy.
[221:57.10]I just have to do a couple of tweaks to them.
[222:00.62]Just on my end.
[222:02.28]There's a few things I need to do.
[222:03.50]I need to resize a couple things and have them play out a little differently.
[222:10.40]Besides that, they're fucking perfect.
[222:14.60]I need a new upgrade.
[222:20.82]I wish there was more than just these little shits.
[222:27.19]The dash master?
[222:28.05]Oh, that's true.
[222:28.95]I could.
[222:31.99]I need a bench for that.
[222:34.23]I gotta kill like six more snake slug enemies.
[222:40.44]150, right?
[222:50.20]I can finally equip a bench in this area.
[222:54.11]Not throw up.
[222:54.83]What is that?
[222:56.57]Come on now.
[223:06.26]Slow and steady.
[223:12.88]Two more.
[223:13.92]Two more slugs.
[223:15.97]Two more.
[223:16.41]That's it.
[223:16.81]I promise.
[223:19.36]Just reload the area.
[223:20.22]Come here, you.
[223:32.11]There's one.
[223:32.93]And there's two.
[223:41.03]Finally.
[223:41.47]Alright.
[223:49.12]Okay.
[223:51.26]Pay the toll.
[223:53.79]I'm going to see where I'm at.
[223:55.75]What I've updated.
[223:57.09]Sit on the damn bench.
[224:03.59]Okay.
[224:04.01]What do we got here?
[224:04.99]I can't do anything here, I don't think.
[224:10.24]Just for shits, I'm going to put on the dash master.
[224:16.48]Let's see.
[224:17.74]Dash master.
[224:20.02]I'm not sure that'll help.
[224:22.52]Where is it?
[224:27.83]Dash master.
[224:28.43]Okay, let me just see what happens.
[224:39.92]That's not gonna help me.
[224:45.06]That's not gonna help me.
[224:55.09]Keep it as is.
[225:00.11]That looks like it didn't even do anything.
[225:01.35]Alright, am I insane or did that not do anything?
[225:06.78]Dash more often?
[225:07.64]It doesn't look like I'm dashing more often at all.
[225:13.80]Ow.
[225:15.34]Um, I don't think I can do anything else here.
[225:19.89]I guess I have to go to deep nest?
[225:25.68]Fairly certain there's nothing else I can do.
[225:27.14]Because I can't go to the right, because it's too high to jump.
[225:37.00]Alright, I might, um... I can't think of what to do exactly in, like, the next few minutes.
[225:43.16]I might just give it a call it, you know?
[225:52.85]Uh...
[225:54.84]Or I could go this way for a minute.
[225:57.68]No.
[226:01.74]I'm very, very lost right now.
[226:04.76]Up, right?
[226:05.22]How do I not have a map for this area?
[226:15.25]I just bought that one downstairs.
[226:22.55]What a rip-off.
[226:28.68]Build my first instinct.
[226:29.70]My first instinct would be to go back to that purple crystal twitch.tv area.
[226:35.64]But good luck having me find that.
[226:38.48]Because I have no idea where I am.
[226:41.50]I think I have to go over here.
[226:47.24]Yes, because I remember I was freaking out about this.
[226:51.51]Turns out I didn't even have to come down here.
[226:56.31]What?
[227:00.44]When I came up, like, this is... This is a real pain in the ass.
[227:09.59]No secrets or anything?
[227:10.45]Might as well check.
[227:16.42]Ooh.
[227:17.78]I can, like, go over there.
[227:18.64]I don't think I'll make the dash, though.
[227:22.92]Oh my god.
[227:32.24]Because this is where I came from.
[227:41.29]This is where the crystal shit was.
[227:50.94]Please get out of my life.
[227:54.48]It's Owen Wilson.
[227:55.40]Oh, wow.
[227:56.46]Okay, City of Tears.
[228:00.86]This is where I was before, right?
[228:03.44]I mean, no, this is like the... I don't even know where the fuck I'm going.
[228:19.88]Ah!
[228:20.26]Soul sanctum, right?
[228:21.30]Isn't that where I was?
[228:24.42]I'm so fucking lost.
[228:29.59]Jesus fucking dog Shit I'm pretty sure it's soul sanctum, but I get didn't I do everything in sanctum or was it over here King station, right?
[228:46.87]Crystal peak Jesus I'm so fucking out of the way How do I get back there
[229:00.41]How did I get down here to begin with?
[229:01.81]I have no idea how I got down here to begin with.
[229:09.17]Why did I come down here?
[229:15.46]I was in Crystal Land already.
[229:17.32]What was the point of me doing that?
[229:24.76]King's Station.
[229:25.64]I go up.
[229:27.59]Make sure I don't miss anything here.
[229:28.77]Yeah, no, we're going this way.
[229:38.06]Yeah, alright.
[229:40.74]This is the tutorial.
[229:41.72]I'm gonna lose my mind.
[229:44.46]I remember the obnoxious George Washington enemies that just clump up together and you can't go by.
[229:48.88]No more complaining.
[229:49.62]I haven't complained about this game in like 14 hours playing it.
[229:53.75]It was a stupid fucking ghost.
[229:55.95]That's what did it.
[229:57.08]And I can't get over it.
[230:00.76]Look at this.
[230:09.93]Something just bothers you and you can't fucking ever get over it.
[230:13.93]Like, I can't get over it.
[230:17.15]Because in my mind, none of this stupid shit would have happened if that didn't happen.
[230:26.20]I've been raging for an hour.
[230:27.38]I probably have been.
[230:39.95]I don't have an area for this map.
[230:42.31]Eat my fucking ass.
[230:47.77]It's not this way.
[230:48.45]But this is, you know, what am I doing now?
[230:50.53]Like, where am I off to now?
[230:52.89]I shouldn't be doing this.
[230:54.30]But I just, I did it anyways.
[230:55.32]I just opened this.
[230:58.40]What's up here?
[231:02.36]Resting grounds.
[231:06.38]Where am I?
[231:09.84]Rest here into hope and freedom.
[231:11.47]I thought, what?
[231:11.89]What?
[231:19.78]Challenge the warrior dream?
[231:21.44]Wha- You know what?
[231:24.46]Sure.
[231:59.82]fuck what I jumped into that
[232:34.92]He's got the spree.
[232:37.12]Fuck.
[232:38.34]Okay.
[233:18.87]Get out of here!
[233:19.85]Get the fuck out of here!
[233:22.91]Now what?
[233:23.43]What do you got?
[233:47.46]Yeah, thanks a lot.
[233:49.18]Let me fucking take that first try.
[233:54.00]I can see those who turn against the king are doomed as soon as they raise their weapon.
[233:56.93]Do not call me a traitor, simply call me a fool.
[234:01.23]I'll be watching wherever you go.
[234:02.47]Hey.
[234:09.96]What'd I get?
[234:10.50]A hundred and... I got a hundred essence for that.
[234:13.60]I can upgrade this now, right?
[234:17.73]I just got 100 essence.
[234:19.23]What does this do?
[234:25.05]Alright.
[234:27.96]Oh, what's this?
[234:29.06]Scary face?
[234:32.12]So now I can go upgrade this weapon.
[234:37.86]Is there something here?
[234:39.43]Did he drop anything?
[234:46.29]Well, alright.
[234:49.88]Wait, what do I mean?
[234:50.42]What did I waste?
[234:54.99]Inventory.
[234:57.47]120.
[235:01.05]Go back to Grandma.
[235:04.00]Yeah, let's go back to the old, uh, that weird lady.
[235:11.94]Do they have anything to say now that I just beat the war person?
[235:17.59]No, that was zero.
[235:18.79]Okay, whatever.
[235:27.17]I wasted my smacks?
[235:31.17]My smacks?
[235:35.16]Hey!
[235:36.18]Bubbles 99, thank you for the $15.
[235:37.50]Thank you.
[235:37.82]Alright, so where's that lady with the essence upgrade thing?
[235:44.37]I don't even know.
[235:48.53]She's somewhere.
[235:55.64]Ah, I remember now.
[235:56.44]Wait a minute, what does this do?
[236:01.00]Nothing.
[236:01.18]She's right over here.
[236:04.50]Hey, look what I have.
[236:07.78]You already collected 100 essence.
[236:08.90]Quick work.
[236:09.41]Things come naturally to you.
[236:10.47]No one of the dreamers tried to bury you in that old dream.
[236:12.73]In any case, you still have a long way to go.
[236:15.13]Take this old trinket as encouragement from me.
[236:16.71]In return, when you have 200, haul in a seal.
[236:23.05]That's it?
[236:28.43]But she just gave me one of those dumb seals?
[236:31.33]For a hundred?
[236:35.19]What?
[236:35.73]That's it?
[236:37.16]I was waiting for some epic upgrade to the weapon or something.
[236:40.58]Oh lord.
[236:46.26]Can I go up from here?
[236:54.32]Alright, let me just get to a save point.
[236:56.16]I think I'm gonna call it for tonight.
[236:59.32]Take a break.
[236:59.76]I mean, if I just got like a cool weapon upgrade, I would have been like, wow, let's fucking do this shit.
[237:14.24]Anyhow, this game is very fun.
[237:17.62]I'm having a blast.
[237:19.40]I'm gonna stream this game again.
[237:20.58]I might not stream this on Tuesday.
[237:24.05]Right?
[237:26.01]I might come back to this later next week.
[237:27.93]I don't know.
[237:28.31]Maybe I might.
[237:29.07]I don't know.
[237:29.47]I might just stream this on Tuesday.
[237:35.69]I'm not sure.
[237:40.10]I don't think I can do anything else.
[237:42.76]I just wish I had a map of any of this shit.
[237:46.78]That's the worst part.
[237:47.58]This world is so huge that not having a map at all means I have no idea even where the fuck I'm supposed to be or where I'm standing.
[237:55.92]I'm like down here somewhere.
[238:05.73]Where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[238:13.06]And this... Oh yeah, over here.
[238:28.25]This wasn't... Okay.
[238:30.41]Am I up?
[238:30.99]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[238:36.13]Go back up.
[238:46.91]Jeremy gets a loss for another hour.
[238:49.81]This is one of those games.
[238:54.45]Yeah, I don't care about the bench next to the old lady, because I don't even have a map of this area, so it ain't gonna even help me.
[239:05.57]Well, how would I... Well, how do you do?
[239:08.61]Hey, well, how do you do?
[239:09.51]Sure.
[239:10.17]How do you do?
[239:12.65]Alright, that's it.
[239:13.19]I'm done.
[239:14.46]That's fucking... Go in a secret entrance and a huge bug is there and I insta-die.
[239:21.16]And then we're all the way back.
[239:22.08]Alright, thanks for watching.
[239:24.44]That's fucking horseshit.
[239:28.54]That is so angering.
[239:30.22]That is so fucking angering.
[239:36.01]Don't you guys love how for the entire game they haven't done that and they decide to do that right now?
[239:43.00]For the ENTIRE fucking video game.
[239:45.52]There was not... HEY!
[239:46.86]WATCH OUT FOR THIS GUY IN FRONT OF YOU!
[239:48.86]Until right now.
[239:49.86]Like 15 hours into the game.
[239:53.93]Give me a fucking break.
[240:05.43]I don't even fucking know how to get back.
[240:09.29]Look at how far away.
[240:11.09]Alright, well, thanks for watching.
[240:12.13]That's it.
[240:13.27]I was going to get to a bench up there and end.
[240:17.32]That is infucking infuriating.
[240:26.68]I did have ample time to get out, but it doesn't matter.
[240:30.00]I'm going to use every excuse in the book.
[240:39.77]I just, like, want to get to the... I just want to get up there.
[240:42.61]This, like, secret passage with a giant bug in it that does two damage per hit.
[240:48.79]And I, like, freaked out and couldn't go anywhere.
[240:50.46]I was, like, in the tunnel.
[240:56.74]I'm so angry right now.
[240:58.24]Where the fuck am I even going?
[241:09.74]I don't even remember.
[241:11.85]Remotely.
[241:12.23]I'm going to go.
[241:17.43]I'm just going to go up and hope I get there.
[241:19.15]No, it's not here.
[241:27.02]It's over here.
[241:27.50]I was having so much fun with this game.
[241:38.53]Like, this was like game of the year for me.
[241:42.22]And now I'm starting to hate very certain things about it.
[241:46.76]I still love the fuck out of this game, though.
[241:50.84]Yeah, back this way.
[242:07.37]No, I can't end the stream.
[242:08.25]I have to get to this stupid fucking spot.
[242:11.47]I can't end yet.
[242:32.32]No, I would keep going.
[242:33.89]It's not that.
[242:38.31]It was a very specific thing that put me on full tilt an hour ago.
[242:43.54]And I've never been able to recover since.
[242:44.92]I did just get a double kill though, so I'm okay with that.
[243:06.45]Alright, I just gotta go over there and sit on the bench.
[243:09.73]I just didn't ever think I was gonna have to do this again.
[243:12.29]Let's go.
[243:22.68]Please don't hurt me.
[243:29.65]Yeah, King's Station.
[243:31.59]A fucking eternity away from where I want to be.
[243:36.53]Because I didn't step on the bench.
[243:38.07]I'm going to now, you better believe it.
[243:56.29]Up we go.
[244:12.27]Get out of the fucking way before my teeth break.
[244:16.75]And I'm just going like this.
[244:17.85]This is a pre- What just happened?
[244:30.79]No, come on!
[244:31.99]Come on!
[244:32.55]Don't do this again!
[244:33.39]I was gonna say, don't do that to me again.
[244:37.05]I didn't deserve that.
[244:42.92]Come on!
[244:43.60]Did you hear the way I said that, by the way?
[244:52.90]That was such a whiny baby way to say that.
[244:55.90]Come on!
[245:04.64]What does that?
[245:05.16]I don't know.
[245:06.62]Seems to kind of randomly happen.
[245:13.58]Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we've returned.
[245:16.16]Just don't die down here, please.
[245:20.48]Just stupid fat bug things.
[245:22.47]Okay.
[245:44.50]Everybody calm down.
[245:45.18]We're fine.
[245:48.40]We're fine.
[245:54.34]We're not fine, but we're fine.
[246:07.21]See?
[246:10.36]Drop down.
[246:17.62]Alright, back to reality.
[246:18.64]And it goes fucking gravity.
[246:21.80]You know how this song goes.
[246:28.41]I'm gonna read the Stag Beetle's thoughts.
[246:29.85]Yeah, I'll do that before I end this stream.
[246:33.57]I will do that.
[246:34.21]And we'll open this massive chest.
[246:37.19]And get a bunch of money.
[246:37.97]We're back to normal.
[246:39.23]Okay, there's a wall here.
[246:43.84]Where else are we going?
[246:46.51]Oh, shit.
[246:47.27]That spike's on the ground.
[246:51.29]Oh, come on.
[246:52.35]Like, come... What is with this?
[246:54.25]What is with this nonsense?
[246:57.28]Like, where am I even going?
[246:58.58]I'm, like, going to a funhouse.
[246:59.80]Something just exploded on me.
[247:11.31]There's another one.
[247:12.09]There's another fucking secret entrance over here.
[247:13.69]This is a fucking house of mirrors.
[247:19.96]So dark.
[247:27.92]Uh, what's this?
[247:29.00]Soul Eater.
[247:34.03]Forgotten Shaman.
[247:34.89]Four!
[247:35.43]Oh, Jesus.
[247:37.01]Greatly increases the amount of soul gained when striking an enemy with a nail.
[247:41.59]That's a lot.
[247:44.33]Okay.
[247:46.17]How do I get out of here?
[247:51.13]Let me rest.
[247:54.77]Do I have to traverse that again, do I?
[247:56.69]Hmm.
[248:00.54]Okay, well.
[248:01.10]I guess I do.
[248:09.38]Anything else?
[248:10.64]You got any more for me?
[248:20.91]Apparently secret master right now.
[248:27.04]We've exited.
[248:27.82]Is there anything else?
[248:33.84]What else is there?
[248:34.44]You throw it at me.
[248:35.86]Somebody's house?
[248:40.47]No, lucky strike.
[248:42.93]Lucky strike again.
[248:44.43]Donating.
[248:44.81]$40. $40.
[248:48.46]It says, here, take the last of my bits.
[248:50.72]Well, thank you so much, LuckyStrike.
[248:52.38]Appreciate that.
[248:55.36]Thank you for the cash.
[248:57.98]Also, Bubbles99 gave $15.
[248:59.98]That was 13 minutes ago.
[249:00.92]Thank you, Bubbles.
[249:04.46]I'm going to sit on the bench first because I'm scared that this is going to be bad.
[249:11.64]What is this?
[249:16.81]Um.
[249:17.81]It's cousin It.
[249:18.83]Okay.
[249:21.91]Ah, let me hear.
[249:23.23]Come here.
[249:23.63]You could not know if tragedy is complete as she.
[249:26.42]True lover stripped apart.
[249:27.40]Two worlds it could not meet.
[249:28.42]Now, me little lover, dead so long in time.
[249:31.88]Dead so far away.
[249:32.72]Buried.
[249:33.26]Moina.
[249:34.20]I, amongst its hateful kin that did deny our union, that did reject cheese.
[249:38.16]Outsideness.
[249:38.82]This person is not speaking in a way that I can understand.
[249:42.37]She doesn't suppose.
[249:43.27]Nalo, nalo.
[249:44.03]Could she ask?
[249:44.73]Could she burden?
[249:46.07]Yeah, sure.
[250:07.59]Hey, Tim Mad, thanks for the 15 bucks.
[250:09.91]Had to cheer and sub.
[250:10.79]No other content creator has given me as many laughs as you have.
[250:12.83]Keep being a dingus.
[250:15.17]I will do my best.
[250:16.70]But thank you for the $15, Tim.
[250:18.76]Appreciate it, man.
[250:21.12]I accept the gift, right?
[250:22.12]Yeah.
[250:26.62]Delicate flower.
[250:30.26]Rare boon you grant.
[250:31.12]It will be she's last request.
[250:32.76]After this, never shall she be labored on another.
[250:35.03]Sacred flower is the offering.
[250:36.05]It is rare, delicate, one of a kind.
[250:40.29]Okay.
[250:41.93]What?
[250:46.13]If you were to get hurt while carrying it or attempt to ride the transit, it would be forever destroyed.
[250:55.98]Her grave lies in the middle of Queen's overgrown estate.
[250:58.23]It is surrounded by her kind who will not look kindly on your trespass.
[251:01.15]Take care.
[251:05.59]Oh, give me a fucking break.
[251:13.17]I can't get hit?
[251:18.21]Where am I right now?
[251:22.35]Oh.
[251:23.45]Oh, no.
[251:26.18]That is so far away.
[251:28.59]Oh, no.
[251:32.45]I am not trying that tonight.
[251:34.37]I'm gonna sit on the bench and rest my ass.
[251:38.77]Alright, that's gonna be it.
[251:43.08]Thank you so much for watching, everybody.
[251:47.14]We will attempt this when I try this game again.
[251:50.14]Which might be Tuesday.
[251:53.91]But thank you so much for watching, everybody.
[251:56.53]I appreciate it.
[251:57.99]Have a good rest of your weekend, or have a good weekend.
[252:00.93]Whatever you end up doing.
[252:03.11]Much love.
[252:04.49]I will see you guys when I see you.
[252:08.03]It'll be Tuesday.
[252:08.73]We might play this again.
[252:10.03]And if we don't play this, we'll play something else.
[252:11.53]So have a good night, guys, and goodbye.
[252:50.49]you
