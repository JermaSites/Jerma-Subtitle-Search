[07:10.76]You get to order the most expensive wine.
[07:12.82]You get to have the most expensive food.
[07:15.65]And I could just sit in the corner over there and just be like this, like, yeah, isn't it nice?
[07:20.21]And she's like, wow, hold on, wait, you took me, you took me here?
[07:25.46]And she's looking around like on vacation and shit.

[09:22.24]Hold on.
[09:26.28]There we go.
[09:27.22]Now that's what I'm talking about.
[09:28.40]That's much better.
[09:29.22]How's that sound?
[09:32.26]That's probably a little too loud.
[09:33.34]Alright.
[09:37.32]Now let's test that out.
[09:40.02]Loud?
[09:40.50]Hold on.
[09:40.78]You tell me.
[09:42.41]Better?
[09:45.11]That's probably fine, right?
[09:50.74]That's good.
[09:51.18]That's fine.
[09:51.64]Alright.
[09:52.44]Difficulty.
[09:53.08]Medium.
[09:58.17]Dominant hand is the right hand.
[09:59.39]I was going to say Dalmatian.
[10:02.21]Light gun.
[10:03.95]Peripheral disabled.
[10:05.81]Adaptive quality on.
[10:07.09]I don't know what any of this means.
[10:11.07]Let's go new game.
[10:12.09]Medium.
[10:14.30]Normal hunter here for the game.
[10:15.88]Okay.
[10:20.08]Anywhere, I'd have to stand somewhere specific.
[10:21.36]Stress level zero.

[11:01.22]Alright, hold on.
[11:01.84]It's loud as fuck.
[11:07.58]I'll take care of it.
[11:23.51]Alright, so duck season, instructional, VHS, tape, yeah.
[11:27.36]Hey hunters, it's duck season, so that means we got a lot of first time hunters out there.
[11:31.40]That's Felix the Cat, I have that.
[11:32.64]How to use your shotgun today.
[11:34.24]All our shotguns come preloaded, so to start shooting, all you gotta do is aim it, and pull the trigger.
[11:41.03]Now to keep shooting, all you gotta do is place your hand on the pump of the shotgun, and right back, baby.
[11:47.47]Now you got another round in the chamber, and you're ready to shoot.
[11:52.78]just like that.
[11:53.84]Now, reloading your shotgun is easy.
[11:56.54]All you gotta do is put your hand up, summon a shell from your box, and put that baby into the chamber underneath the shotgun.
[12:05.94]Pump it one more time, and you're ready to go again.
[12:10.24]Now, professional hunters, they like to keep their shotgun topped off.
[12:14.62]So each time you fire off a round and you have a second, you know, put a baby in there.
[12:19.28]Keep yourself prepared for the amount of ducks that'll be flying at you.
[12:22.16]They'll be coming from everywhere.
[12:23.36]From the left, to the right.
[12:26.65]They're everywhere, man.
[12:27.71]So I hope you guys learned something.
[12:29.23]And remember, the first rule of gun safety is have fun.
[12:32.61]Because remember...
[12:47.52]Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[12:53.60]It's the tutorial, put that back in.
[12:58.30]Put that back in.
[13:00.20]Hey hunters, it's duck season, so that means we got a lot of first time hunters out there.
[13:04.69]I'm gonna teach you how to use your shotgun today.
[13:07.11]All our shotguns come pre-loaded, so to start shooting, all you gotta do is aim it.
[13:12.63]and pull the trigger.
[13:13.35]Now if you keep shooting, all you gotta do is place your hand on the pump of the shotgun and rack that baby.
[13:20.32]Now you got another round in the chamber and you're ready to shoot.
[13:22.52]Whoa, a banana!
[13:26.72]It's huge!
[13:27.60]What?
[13:28.00]What kind of mutant world are we living in?
[13:36.92]Why are these so big?
[13:37.72]I used to have a cup like this.
[13:41.47]Alright.
[13:51.92]Okay, just play.
[13:52.80]How do I play?
[13:53.42]Level 1?
[13:53.82]Oh, I gotta... Level 1.
[13:59.54]It's lagging.
[14:10.26]Is it cocks?
[14:14.98]It's not doing that on my end.
[14:16.16]No, it's just... Really?
[14:28.30]Oh, it's a drop of frames.
[14:30.81]Fuck.
[14:41.25]The line controller's pulled trigger, but I'm not getting any, like, hardware lag.
[14:44.72]Let me just check and see how many frames I've dropped.
[14:49.68]It's never easy, is it?
[14:56.55]It's never easy.
[14:59.50]Okay, just play a goddamn game.
[15:08.83]Ah, shit.
[15:09.41]No, it is like... What the fuck is going on here?
[15:12.09]Hold on.
[15:15.55]My CPU's going like nuts.
[15:17.71]Why?
[15:17.99]I didn't change anything from last time.
[15:33.80]I got nothing else going on in the background here.
[15:35.36]Let me just do one thing real quick here.
[15:49.29]Nah, I got like, yeah, I got like an encoding issue.
[15:52.01]What the fuck?
[15:54.59]It's BT.TV!
[15:56.49]Better twitch.tv!
[15:57.97]I'm gonna have to, I might have to restart the stream.
[16:00.71]Why?
[16:04.03]No!
[16:05.25]OBS had a fucking major update today.
[16:10.47]There was a major OBS update today that I think may have caused me a problem.
[16:14.70]Fuck.
[16:16.48]Uh-oh.
[16:22.82]Uh, I'm gonna change to the other codec.
[16:25.03]The stream's gonna turn off.
[16:27.17]Tell me how this works.
[16:27.93]I'll be right back.
[16:30.93]I'll be right back.
[16:42.23]Hello?
[16:54.80]How's it look?
[16:56.80]My CPU has dropped by an insane amount.
[17:03.94]Yeah, OBS had a pretty major update today.
[17:07.20]And I just changed it to like hardware codec.
[17:09.61]That's the first time I've had to do that in like three years.
[17:14.36]Okay.
[17:15.00]Well, sorry about that.
[17:16.62]That was weird.
[17:17.62]Didn't expect an update to do that, but... Let me know if it keeps going or if anything else happens.
[17:24.58]Wait, I got an opportunity to drink an iced coffee.
[17:29.76]Yeah, OBS was at like 60% CPU.
[17:34.10]Now it's at 11%.
[17:34.80]Okie dokie.
[17:41.87]Let's go.
[17:42.91]Let's actually play.
[17:46.45]Alright, duck season.
[17:50.25]Alright, put your hand here.
[18:01.20]And then pump.
[18:19.05]How many do I gonna have in there?
[18:28.06]It's wicked loud.
[18:32.86]This is fucking Vive, man.
[18:35.34]I need like a tech director to play Vive.
[18:38.16]Alright, round one.
[18:41.03]Ready?
[18:41.47]Just lower your volume for like five minutes.
[19:54.75]Yeah, come on.
[19:57.18]I'm pretty good at these kind of games.
[20:03.45]Throw like more than one at me.
[20:46.11]Let me blow up the fucking volume.
[20:47.53]This is probably like unbearable.
[20:50.07]There you go.
[21:07.05]Alright, round two.
[21:09.13]I think I'm getting the hang of this.
[21:13.51]See, now it's not as horrible.
[21:14.45]Let me load the shotgun up a little bit here.
[21:16.59]How many can fit in there?
[21:18.35]One, two, three, four, five.
[21:19.85]Okay.
[21:24.80]Bring it on.
[21:37.02]Fuck!
[21:42.21]It's alright.
[21:56.44]I feel like I'm playing Diner Dash.
[22:04.13]Didn't even need to look, did I?
[22:05.97]Oh!
[22:13.76]This is fucking fun.
[22:16.06]Can I not even do the horror movie part?
[22:17.60]Can I just do this?
[22:29.91]Okay, those are the ducks that I... I thought I was getting creepered over here.
[22:34.29]Alright, is it loaded?
[22:40.61]I don't need to reach.
[22:42.97]No.
[22:45.67]You're gonna get louder.
[22:48.41]Turn around.
[23:28.24]Oh, nope.
[23:29.20]I ain't gonna do that.
[23:29.90]I ain't gonna do that one.
[23:35.97]Here we go.
[23:39.04]Look at me!
[24:10.08]I don't have to do that.
[24:10.84]I have to though.
[24:11.44]It's VR.
[24:20.23]Two more?
[24:27.35]What do I get for a ranking?
[24:29.27]That's gotta be at least like a D. Is that at least a D?
[24:43.58]Quickly!
[24:44.06]Quick!
[24:49.01]God damn it!
[24:49.39]Come on!
[24:49.73]Where's my mouse?
[24:58.08]What?
[25:14.84]Like around the back.
[25:16.44]Now I have to do that, right?
[25:21.32]Okay, if you shot a shotgun that close to somebody's head, their hearing would be gone for the rest of their life.
[25:28.09]That would be like a bang, like, like the whole, everybody would be like going like this.
[25:46.48]How's that?
[25:48.86]Turn up the volume!
[25:50.06]Turn down the volume!
[25:51.18]Turn up the volume!
[25:52.32]Turn down the volume!

[27:04.37]Alright, I'm gonna go to like the steep, no, I'm gonna go back out and.

[27:53.61]Multiplier?
[27:58.86]Use language, use Steam menu for volume.
[28:11.63]Everybody use hand signals to communicate with him.

[35:17.16]Pretty good?
[35:22.03]Eat the shells?
[35:23.29]No, I already almost hurt myself.
[35:27.79]Did Jeremy already do the shoot the dog joke?
[35:31.00]Yes.
[35:40.25]He's bigger, tougher, and more determined than ever.
[36:13.37]That was pretty good.

[36:44.13]Fuck!
[36:47.67]Come on, man!
[36:48.85]Oh, I can do it again.
[37:07.59]I can't let go of it.
[37:08.33]How do I let go?
[37:13.27]Has anybody done that before?
[37:21.04]That's pretty good fan physics.
[37:26.66]Were you like this when you were a kid?
[37:28.10]I don't know, probably.
[37:33.61]I did it with a beat.
[37:41.01]Alright, it's gonna be probably harder.
[37:43.59]I'm ready.
[37:47.32]It's gone.
[37:48.18]Bad luck.
[38:13.95]Okay, by the way, this shirt stinks like a dirty laundry basket.
[38:18.33]It's fucking me up.
[38:21.49]It was in the laundry, I think, for too long, and it has that, like, dirty, like, inside of a gym, gym bag smell.
[38:27.36]Just fucking put one in!
[38:44.22]I swear to God that I'm ripping this shirt in half.
[38:47.68]It stinks in here.
[38:49.12]Like it's not me.
[38:50.06]It's the shirt.
[39:00.09]It's not me.
[39:01.17]It's not me.
[39:02.13]It's like it was in the laundry for too, too long and it didn't get dried fast enough.
[39:08.07]And now it has that like smelly.
[39:11.21]I thought somebody just like fucking hacked me.
[39:24.94]filling my nostrils every time I breathe in.
[39:31.46]It's not me.
[39:35.84]It's because I started to get some moisture going through the shirt.
[39:49.05]Everybody relax.
[39:57.08]Change shirt, check.
[39:58.24]Not yet.
[40:00.31]I deserve this.
[40:52.99]I'm watching in spell-o-vision, and this is unbearable.
[40:55.61]Please change shirts.

[42:10.77]This looks like really good.
[42:12.03]I know, this is like a... Actually, it's kind of like a dirty laundry pizza, but I still think it looks good.
[42:20.46]Ike, you can actually take a bite out of it.
[42:21.88]Fucking game of the year.
[42:26.94]What's that?

[42:40.20]This says, uh, radical racers.
[42:44.20]My guy's gonna stand still like this, and then I'll be able to know what direction that I- like, where the gravity is.
[42:50.05]Okay, so gravity's going this way, so I'm standing on the wall this way, so I'm like, like that, okay?

[45:49.74]I'll just drink coffee and eat soft cheeses.
[46:06.23]That's not appropriate for work.
[46:07.37]I can't do that.
[46:07.93]A lot of people watch my stream during work.
[46:20.90]My boss heard you.
[46:21.70]That's what I'm saying.
[46:22.30]I gotta be more careful.
[46:24.48]Not applicable for work.
[46:27.88]One would say it's not safe to watch this stream if you're at jobs.
[46:53.42]What the fuck are you doing?
[46:56.46]I'm trying to pump the damn thing.
[47:00.43]Pump the damn thing.

[82:26.13]I called the police?
[82:28.47]Why is mom dead?
[82:30.85]Why would mom be dead here?
[82:51.26]We're going to bury mom?
[82:52.68]Uh, okay.
[82:53.54]This is not just a good ending, this is a bad ending too.
[83:19.59]Duck season.
[83:20.79]So is there an ending where mom lives?
[83:24.01]That was a little out of control.
[83:25.87]It was a fun game though.

[95:31.93]Hold the bucket to your face.
[95:35.63]Just look at the ground.
[95:41.35]Learn the basics.
[95:42.07]Use a comfortable movement method.
[95:45.40]You're going to need to know how to navigate this trackpad.
[95:48.58]Hold the trackpad button to aim your movement.
[95:53.46]You use sprint.
[95:55.10]Do you prefer a different movement option, teleport, sprint, or trackpad?
[95:59.32]Teleport.
[96:03.60]I'm going to say teleport.
[96:15.58]Trackpad?
[96:16.02]How would you prefer to aim?

[97:27.48]Thank you.
[97:30.51]Yo, that's so much easier.
[97:31.81]I'm not gonna die now.
[97:45.08]Grip.
[97:45.62]Use that menu button to drop weapons.
[97:48.52]So press menu to drop on the X. Nice job.
[97:52.10]OK.
[97:52.16]Now let's check out the backpack.
[97:55.86]Use the grip button to pick up the bag.
[97:57.86]Make sure you hold it this time.
[97:59.84]Hold the grip.
[98:01.52]That's not how you pick a backpack up.
[98:03.04]Use the cut button to open the backpack.
[98:04.37]Pick up the knife and store it in one of your backpack slots.
[98:12.10]Nice job.
[98:12.44]Now grab the backpack by the handle, move it over your shoulder, release the grip on the pistol.
[98:17.61]Hey, nice job, Rookie.
[98:18.55]Alright.
[98:18.89]Why don't you head over to that armory?
[98:22.11]I gotta get out of here and get... It's a dinosaur!
[98:30.57]It's not gonna kill us, right?
[98:32.58]Wait, give him a knife!
[98:33.28]Hey, Rookie, freeze.
[98:39.74]Think you did too much.
[99:05.79]Climb up the ladder, you got it.
[99:09.66]There.
[99:13.82]Wait, what is that?
[99:14.82]Why is there a secret Alice in Wonderland door?
[99:25.43]Oh, it's from the helicopter.
[99:34.73]Reach out and grab a run.
[99:35.93]Alright, that's not even... You sprint to enter tower.
[100:03.45]Here you go, soldier.
[100:04.37]You're going to need this.
[100:05.63]You can get your ammo port out of that case over there.
[100:10.31]Lucky for you.
[100:11.47]Lucky for you, double agent.
[100:13.29]Make sure you keep holding the grip button or you're going to drop it.
[100:19.32]Pull the ammo to your chest to store it.
[100:20.74]Now, use the grip button to reload.
[100:24.84]Great.
[100:25.32]Now look, our only long range time is when that building just got wrecked.
[100:29.19]There's another base located a couple clicks over there.
[100:31.05]I can't do it.
[100:32.05]If you can make it there, you should be in the clear.
[100:34.46]I can't shoot this guy.
[100:36.54]That's a good idea.
[100:41.32]This is the absolute worst way we could be having this conversation.
[100:45.69]Oh, the kids!
[100:46.77]The kids are doing good?
[100:55.03]Alright, it's fine.
[100:56.21]It doesn't work.
[101:03.84]Aim movement at ladder to exit.
[101:09.54]Follow your waypoint.
[101:10.32]Be careful out there.
[101:10.92]I'll keep an eye on you from here.
[101:16.14]Alright.
[101:16.48]Fall like a nose.
[101:20.39]Restricted aerial.
[101:21.25]Warning.
[101:21.59]Alright.
[101:25.05]We're looking for what?
[101:25.87]We're looking for dinosaurs.
[101:26.85]Here's another waypoint for you.
[101:49.08]How did he even mean to do that?
[101:55.29]Get to the thing.
[101:57.85]What?
[102:00.29]Just like one, two, three.
[102:09.31]Alright.
[102:09.85]Oh, you're too close.
[102:16.61]What's in here?
[102:18.17]Oh, more of this.
[102:19.29]Ooh.
[102:22.35]Hold down grip with gun hand until ammo selector appears.
[102:36.82]It's in the area.
[102:38.22]Just watch what happens.
[102:40.61]Alright, that's odd, but fine.
[102:42.41]Hang on, I'll open this gate for you.
[102:44.69]Just give me a second.
[102:48.15]Thanks a lot.
[102:48.61]I don't even know what this guy's name is.
[102:51.81]Hold up.
[102:53.65]You hear that?
[102:55.29]Kill the raptors.
[102:57.21]Now you're being hunted.
[102:59.00]Get ready.
[103:00.80]These girls can be clever.
[103:15.68]When did they attack?
[103:26.91]Thank you.
[103:27.23]That was kind of lame.
[103:29.15]It's alright, though.
[103:29.87]Hey, you doing alright?
[103:31.15]Maybe you could use a little boost.
[103:37.30]Go check out that crate full of health items over there.
[103:47.74]That was scary.
[103:50.06]I thought that was a tree.
[103:53.38]I thought it was a tree.
[103:54.48]Then it started moving.
[104:21.58]grab everything that's cool up into the house what kind of door it doesn't have it's a push door really
[104:56.03]What the fuck?
[105:00.43]Move upgrade to highlighted area on guns.
[105:06.43]Laser sight.
[105:10.28]What was that?
[105:15.10]Hurry up and get to the gate.
[105:19.44]Can I sneak out this way?
[105:21.50]Yep.
[105:22.90]Come on, I can't do that.
[105:25.06]Shit.
[105:44.57]Where?
[105:45.93]Kill the stegosaur.
[105:47.05]Where's their stegosaur?
[106:12.22]I want to see a clip of that.
[106:13.74]I want to see how stupid I actually am.
[106:27.45]There's no stegosaur.
[106:32.70]What a fucking idiot.
[106:52.71]I could hear him!
[106:54.71]But he wasn't on the screen.
[107:13.50]Alright, T-Rex is going to show up right here.
[107:14.88]Alright, let's go.
[107:22.25]Island 359.
[107:22.51]So what do you do?
[107:27.70]What are you supposed to do in this game?
[107:32.36]Update 1.0.
[107:33.80]Survival mode exists now.
[107:35.41]What is over here?
[107:39.53]Mercenary store.
[107:40.40]Cash in merc credits for gear.
[107:42.14]Sell found gear for credits.
[107:48.08]Okay, that's pretty cool.
[107:49.08]Let me get this shit on.
[107:52.44]Alright, see you later.
[107:58.14]Good luck.
[108:02.97]Survival mode?
[108:04.03]What do you want me to do?
[108:06.85]Sell your knife and gun.
[108:13.93]Survival.
[108:16.25]Uh, a carefully paced survival experience, traverse the open island, discover survivor stories, explore camp, scrounge, loot, kill, and survive.
[108:24.16]Okay.
[108:25.62]I'll give it a try.
[108:33.62]Here comes, I'm gonna throw up for this.
[108:39.55]Do I get a different gun?
[108:40.47]Same gun?
[108:51.06]Yeah, yeah, give me that.
[108:52.69]Keep in mind, this is our first real look at this island.
[108:56.91]I'm not doing that again.
[109:00.01]I'm going to wear the bucket.
[109:01.45]I just want to land.
[109:08.39]That kind of hurts.
[109:16.26]That's a great feature.
[109:17.90]I don't even know what I'm looking at.
[109:19.38]Am I crazy or is this, does that look strange?
[109:32.01]My hand is fucked up, that's alright.
[109:40.63]I feel like I'm looking at the world through some strange filter.
[109:44.38]Do I have to eat berries or something?
[109:46.00]Eat weeds?
[109:49.31]Alright, I hear something.
[109:55.27]I don't have any bullets in this gun.
[109:58.05]Get out of here!
[110:04.98]You're equipped with a tent, so use it when you need to sleep.
[110:07.65]Just save the progress.
[110:09.43]Grab it off your backpack, throw it on the ground, and then use your watch to set an alarm for how long you want to sleep for.
[110:14.87]When you're done, don't forget to pick your tent back up.
[110:18.17]Stick it back on there like a kabob.
[110:19.45]If you find a bed, you can just use one of those.
[110:21.79]Set the alarm on your watch to sleep as well.
[110:24.51]Set the alarm on your what the?
[110:26.47]Oh, this is on my hunger meter?
[110:27.99]OK, I'm just going to find the bed.
[110:40.45]that's that's just a j that's a jpeg that's not going to do anything for me what about over here up in the top no there's a building right here there we go health what about food do I need anything that's the eel what's the potato chips
[111:21.70]Okay, no, give me the knife back.
[111:24.22]Uh, there's something in here.
[111:24.92]There's a crate here?
[111:25.60]I don't think I can do anything with it.
[111:31.62]Can I not do something with this?
[111:37.69]This is like a weapon crate.
[111:41.61]Should I go in the outhouse?
[111:47.49]Alright, uh, this is just an open world.
[111:52.39]Let's climb up.
[112:04.67]Pretty good vantage point, though.
[112:07.87]Crowbar?
[112:12.12]Can I pick?
[112:12.46]I don't think I can pick that up.
[112:17.56]Yeah, I can.
[112:18.22]Nice.
[112:26.07]I'll bash it.
[112:27.27]Somebody's heading with this thing.
[112:28.45]Okay.
[112:30.88]Check the other one.
[112:35.00]This is not a rhinoceros.
[112:36.98]What are those things?
[112:37.98]Triceratops.
[112:41.06]Triceratops friendly?
[112:54.89]Will they run after me?
[113:03.66]I don't even know where he is.
[113:04.72]Oh my god, he's freaking out.
[113:13.78]He's like a dog with the zoomies.
[113:15.97]He's a dog that just had a bath.
[113:18.17]What is it?
[113:21.55]Shit, that was so mean.
[113:22.77]Did he tire himself out?
[113:43.60]You killed that dog.
[113:44.68]I didn't kill anything.
[114:00.45]Come here, you motherfucker.
[114:21.20]Oh, he hit me.
[114:24.03]He's hitting me.
[114:24.67]Alright, I have to get out of this.
[114:33.17]I'm going to die.
[114:34.03]Have fun.
[114:39.64]Goodbye.
[114:39.98]I ain't getting killed over this.
[114:46.85]I'm already, like, dead.
[114:47.74]He's just stuck down there in that ditch.
[115:00.22]Still there?
[115:00.98]That's so terrifying that they move so erratically like that.
[115:03.62]If you come across a huge... Ugh.
[115:07.15]Where was I?
[115:07.47]Where did I want to go?
[115:08.15]Is that him?
[115:09.59]I'm just gonna go this way.
[115:27.21]How do I eat?
[115:31.79]Oh shit, I'm almost dead.
[115:36.77]What's up there?
[115:46.14]Okay, there's... I don't know what that thing is.
[115:52.74]Do I have to eat the dinosaurs?
[115:54.08]Is that how this works?
[115:56.65]He's not threatening, right?
[115:57.50]They're not that threatening.
[116:00.36]That's not a Velociraptor.
[116:01.80]That's some other weird dinosaur.
[116:16.99]It looks kind of mean, though.
[116:18.05]I'm not going to fuck with that.
[116:33.73]It's an elephant!
[116:34.57]It's an elephant!
[116:37.93]Run!
[116:38.01]Why is it an elephant?
[116:39.03]Run away!
[116:59.65]Oh, that's unbelievable.
[117:03.44]Is that what that dinosaur actually sounded like?
[117:12.40]Get out of here!
[117:13.90]Hey, you want something?
[117:16.34]Here!
[117:22.77]I think I ate it.
[117:27.29]He's running again!
[117:36.54]He's still chasing me with his tuba.
[117:44.77]Oh, come on.
[117:51.81]Why is he still here?
[117:52.89]I don't know how to get away from him.
[117:59.07]I'm going to have to turn him in the head.
[118:09.15]I'm just spit on myself.
[118:14.43]He's still chasing me.
[118:27.40]Why aren't you out of breath at this point?
[118:32.40]He's gonna keel over and die from exhaustion.
[118:42.65]There's a car.
[118:43.15]Can I get in the car?
[118:48.04]Oh, I gotta get on top of the car.
[118:49.34]Alright, I'm on top of the car.
[118:50.48]He can't get me.
[119:10.08]You bastard.
[119:11.08]Get away from me.
[119:12.25]God, leave.
[119:14.55]Leave me alone.
[119:15.53]This is the stupidest thing.
[119:24.61]He followed me for like 12 blocks.
[119:43.26]That was too much.
[119:47.28]I swear to God, if I get off this and he's right there, I'm going to fucking pee my pants.
[119:52.46]Okay, are we good?
[119:53.20]I'm going to open this door.
[119:55.98]Fucking elephant.
[120:03.97]How do I open this?
[120:10.44]Nothing even in here, there's just mold.
[120:20.07]I can't get over that.
[120:21.87]That was stupid.
[120:24.24]Okay, let's keep going.
[120:25.56]I need to, I'm gonna die.
[120:31.26]The whole world is red right now because I'm one head away from death.
[120:48.60]Oh, shit.
[120:57.11]Does he have a camera?
[120:59.49]He's, like, dude, he's videotaping, like, a skateboard video.
[121:02.51]Look at that.
[121:05.69]Watch.
[121:06.59]A fucking velociraptor's gonna do, like, an ollie right here and go over him.
[121:17.18]Is he gonna...
[121:22.36]No, I think he's too far away.
[121:25.98]Yeah, he's recovering.
[121:28.02]He's thinking about what he did.
[121:41.78]Is that like a base I can ransack or something?
[121:56.92]I don't like how open this looks.
[121:58.17]This is a big open field.
[121:59.69]I don't like it at all.
[122:06.73]I also don't like what's going on here on the skyline.
[122:08.94]It really hurts my head.
[122:30.09]I'm so lost.
[122:37.37]There's something right here.
[122:50.34]What is it?
[122:50.72]It's a stegosaurus.
[123:00.20]Don't like run around in a circle like a dog.
[123:15.41]I can't get on top of this rock, can I?
[123:19.73]Okay, I'm on the rock.
[123:22.13]I think I'm safe.
[123:25.56]Base.
[123:31.31]How do I get by you to get down there?
[123:34.91]Wrap all the way around?
[123:35.76]Shit.
[123:46.53]He's just waiting for me to move.
[123:48.47]He's just got his eyes on me.
[123:50.33]I didn't know Stegosaurus was that fast.
[123:53.09]I thought they were slow, lumbering animals.
[124:15.08]Ammo will give me something.
[124:20.32]The base is right down here.
[124:21.44]There's air conditioning here.
[124:28.44]That's electricity.
[124:31.54]Ugh.
[124:36.01]What is that?
[124:40.07]Punch it?
[124:40.47]It's not going to work.
[124:53.16]Is there like a front door?
[124:54.34]There it is.
[124:56.64]How do I open this?
[125:05.24]There's a big on button.
[125:06.70]That would work, wouldn't it?
[125:15.53]Eureka!
[125:19.01]Give me something to eat or scavenge or something.
[125:21.81]I got AC over here.
[125:25.01]Let's go in the building.
[125:34.44]Find story note to unlock.
[125:36.26]What is this, Slenderman?
[125:37.18]What do you mean find story note?
[125:48.99]No bullets, no nothing?
[125:55.87]Oh, god damn it.
[125:56.51]Come on, what tent?
[125:57.62]It's getting dark out.
[125:58.50]I can't even go in this tent.
[126:02.98]Anything in the dumpster?
[126:05.14]Keep an eye out for crafting tables.
[126:10.34]You're going to need to scavenge for any supplies you can find.
[126:14.31]If nothing... Sticks, tape, strings, whatever.
[126:17.15]Sticks, tape?
[126:18.15]Try combining it all on a crafting table and see what you can make.
[126:20.87]Folks have probably posted some crafting recipes for you to try out on the internet.
[126:26.48]uh okay I haven't I'm supposed to be picking up sticks I gotta get another note it's getting too dark ResidentSleeper crafting game look let me just next game hold on give me one second

[127:30.63]Let's see how it is.
[127:33.93]Yeah, that's like putting sticks together and making fires.
[127:36.59]I don't wanna do that.
[127:49.16]Mercenary mode.
[127:50.62]Move freely, explore, hunt, kill, or be killed.

[128:53.15]Okay.
[128:53.49]How do I get rid of this gun?
[128:55.43]Can't grab arrow with gun.
[128:56.95]Well, how do I let go of this?
[129:12.68]Okay, arrows.
[129:16.12]Where are the arrows?
[129:19.58]Where are the arrows?
[129:24.00]What the fuck is this?
[129:24.78]I don't know, what is that?
[129:34.89]What is this?
[129:40.93]Where are the arrows?
[129:41.49]It says, can't grab arrows with gun.
[129:46.52]Why not?
[130:02.82]Oh.

[132:15.67]Let's move.
[132:16.41]Okay, let's go.
[132:17.69]No, I don't want that.
[132:18.61]Let's just, I'm gonna kill this thing.
[132:20.77]I don't even need, I don't give a shit about anything else.
[132:24.29]Let's go.
[132:33.36]While you're at it, we're looking for some of this rare metal we found on the island.
[132:36.71]It's a side mission for sure, but know that it has huge benefits to your tools.
[132:41.06]See if you can grab some and store them in your vest before you get back to the job.
[133:03.65]Christ.
[133:03.91]Please just let me do it.
[133:23.26]Okay, I'm moving on.
[133:32.66]This game's actually pretty cool.
[133:38.22]This game's pretty cool.
[133:39.14]It is.
[133:39.46]It's a pretty cool game.
[133:40.74]I'll tell you.
[133:41.12]Alright, next up is Apollo Creed, the boxing game.
[133:54.40]This game makes me angry.
[133:55.74]Wait, why?
[133:58.35]How the fuck did I end up over here?
[134:10.30]Give me one sec.
[134:18.27]I'm the bad guy.
[134:21.61]You look sad.
[134:22.44]Sad?
[134:22.92]You wanna do horror?
[134:31.83]I do have a horror game.
[134:40.73]Alright, we'll try this horror game that I got.
[134:42.13]Let me close out of this.
[134:44.51]Alright, how do I get out of this?
[134:55.90]Quick.
[135:00.00]Okay.
[135:03.84]Uh, the game I have is called Dread Halls.
[135:05.70]And it looked like people thought it was fun, looked like it was pretty highly rated.
[135:11.60]Let's give it a try.
[135:21.72]Yeah, Dreadhalls.
[135:28.47]Not that one.
[135:30.11]What's wrong with that one?
[135:30.83]Okay, launch Dreadhalls in SteamVR mode.
[135:41.67]That's the one I want to do.
[135:42.61]Alright, let's just do it.
[136:02.15]Alright.
[136:05.63]I need to change the game to Dreadhalls.
[136:24.07]Is this game going to actually cause me a problem?
[136:28.29]As long as I don't throw up, I don't care.
[136:31.13]And turn the lights off.
[136:32.11]Why does that matter?
[136:36.80]Turn the lights off?
[136:38.22]I'm in here.
[136:40.58]Why do I need to turn the lights off?
[136:44.56]Turn the lights off.
[136:46.77]That...
[136:55.15]Hold on.
[137:00.27]Why would you want me to do this?
[137:11.36]I can't even... Why can I not control my lights?
[137:14.22]I'm not connected?
[137:15.00]Unable to connect?
[137:17.82]To my Philips Hue?
[137:18.98]Why?
[137:26.55]There we go.
[137:29.45]Is that better?
[137:29.95]Alright, see you guys on there.
[137:42.29]By the way, if you want to know the plan, on Saturday, I'm pretty sure me and Star are going to do some co-op VR games.
[137:52.60]So, that should be a lot of fun.
[138:00.17]We're gonna try, like, Rec Room.
[138:03.19]Couple other multiplayer games.
[138:04.61]See how they are.
[138:05.03]Ow, my hair.
[138:13.64]I gotta prepare for this.
[138:14.64]I hate this shit.
[138:16.66]Goddamn, like, horror games.
[138:18.76]And I gotta put both headphones in.
[138:20.20]Hey, get ready for some fake reactions.
[138:33.99]Yeah, that's right.
[138:36.41]It's Tuber time!
[138:42.89]Let me give you a good thumbnail first, though.
[138:44.41]Let me get you a good thumbnail.
[138:53.89]Right?
[138:54.09]Is that good?
[138:58.58]Both of these have to go in.
[138:59.61]God damn it.
[139:03.63]I'm fucking puking this thing.
[139:09.03]I'm doing both.
[139:09.93]I'm doing both.
[139:10.67]It's a horror game.
[139:11.53]I'm gonna do both.
[139:16.86]Alright.
[139:20.90]Here we go.
[139:28.82]Dammit.
[139:30.78]Just don't ever have hair.
[139:31.81]Just get rid of it.
[139:33.43]It just gets in the way.
[139:34.63]It's just dead.
[139:36.97]Why even have it?
[139:39.51]It's just fingernails.
[139:40.49]You know that your hair is just your fingernails, but finer.
[139:43.79]We cut our fingernails, just get rid of them.
[139:45.99]We're gonna evolve our fingernails off anyways.
[139:50.99]Alright, I'm ready.
[139:51.84]No, I'm not.
[139:56.39]Okay, that was... I was just puked.
[139:59.97]I was just, like, refluxed.
[140:03.77]Fucking stalling.
[140:04.61]I know I'm stalling.
[140:05.45]Alright.
[140:15.27]Options.
[140:17.09]Audio setting.
[140:18.23]Five hands.
[140:19.07]Right-handed.
[140:20.47]Keep the tutorial on.
[140:21.48]How are we doing on audio?
[140:23.90]Are we good?
[140:31.51]How's that?
[140:33.17]Pretty good.
[140:35.13]Video settings should be fine.
[140:36.38]Quality, good.
[140:37.92]Anti-aliasing, that's fine, whatever.
[140:40.68]Movement settings.
[140:42.12]Rotation speed, snap comfort.
[140:44.92]Move in looking direction.
[140:46.08]Press trackpad to move.
[140:47.22]I think that's fine.
[140:53.84]Well, here you go, motherfuckers!
[140:57.04]This is what you wanted!
[140:59.41]Content warning, this game is an intense horror experience featuring scenes of disturbing nature.
[141:03.36]Player discretion is advised.
[141:11.90]Inventory, move, light.
[141:14.90]Interact, open, sprint, map, look.
[141:19.50]So I move around with this, I look with this.
[141:22.76]That's inventory, this is map.
[141:25.38]Interact and light and then sprint.
[141:44.43]Point with your right hand and press trigger to pick up.
[141:49.62]A bottle of oil.
[141:50.48]You can use it to fuel your lamp.
[141:52.38]Right trigger to collect.
[141:55.72]Oh, I have a lamp.
[141:58.62]This is just VR amnesia.
[142:08.69]You actually have to walk around.
[142:10.93]What the fuck is this thing?
[142:12.55]A handwritten note.
[142:14.70]I can't wait for you.
[142:15.58]Not anymore.
[142:16.22]Not here.
[142:16.88]There's an exit.
[142:18.24]The stone face told me.
[142:20.60]I'll be there.
[142:21.58]I'll wait for you there.
[142:22.80]Follow my trail.
[142:23.70]Find the eyes.
[142:24.64]Find the exit.
[142:31.04]Hold right hand trigger and turn hand left and right.
[143:07.87]Okay.
[143:08.29]So does that drive a weapon?
[143:22.56]Two coins!
[143:24.30]You can always brute force locks, but using these lockpicks should be faster.
[143:28.10]Right trigger to collect them.
[143:29.64]What about these coins?
[143:31.54]A coin from the past, right trigger to collect it.
[143:34.72]What do you do with the coins, though?
[143:55.37]in haunted house games.
[144:17.94]Should I close this behind me?
[144:18.90]Close, get this thing closed.
[144:23.56]How can I tell how much oil is in the tank here?
[144:26.48]Use the oil in your inventory to fuel your lamp.
[144:31.70]So that's the inventory.
[144:32.40]What the hell is that noise?
[144:37.97]Grab the lamp oil.
[144:43.49]Okay, that makes it brighter.
[144:44.77]I have a couple more lockpicks.
[144:54.42]When do I get machete?
[145:18.14]Open the inventory and grab... So grab a lockpick.

[146:29.90]It's right through here.
[146:43.97]Oh, my God.
[146:46.53]Should I turn around and run the other way?
[147:10.53]Looks like a receptacle for something.
[147:12.59]Here, this!
[147:27.19]What do I do?
[147:34.34]I hear something moving over here behind me.
[147:36.16]I need to fill this up with oil.
[147:48.25]I didn't change the game away from Dino D-Day, whatever it's called.
[147:53.23]What's it called?
[147:53.83]Island Dino?
[147:56.11]Is there a mod with power?
[147:57.53]Can you change it?
[147:58.36]No, I did change it.
[147:59.14]I'm just panicking right now.
[148:39.70]Give me this.
[148:48.02]Give me these.

[148:55.37]Hey!
[148:56.51]What is this?
[148:56.87]What is this?
[148:57.33]What is that for?
[148:59.45]It's an eyeball.
[149:09.28]The human eye, find the eyes.
[149:10.85]Oh no, that's gonna activate her.
[149:15.25]I just activated her.
[149:20.16]I just activated her!
[149:37.48]I'm going with the Burgah Boy technique.
[149:44.33]You ready?
[149:44.75]Burgah Boy technique.
[149:46.95]What would Burgah Boy do?
[149:48.11]He would do this.
[149:49.53]I'm running out of breath.
[150:07.47]Hold on.
[150:07.85]Wait a minute.
[150:08.17]Wait, wait, wait.
[150:08.55]I need to... Where do I go from here?
[150:16.22]Alright, I can go that way.
[150:17.08]One of these is going to open.
[150:23.15]That opened.
[150:23.65]Anything else open?
[150:28.55]No?
[150:29.05]That's the good witch of the west, right?
[150:31.37]The good witch of the east.
[150:39.78]I did it.
[150:41.74]There must be another eye.
[150:42.79]There's a snake?
[151:24.15]Where is that person coming from?
[151:31.83]Where is that person coming from?
[151:33.41]There's a room to the left.
[151:35.31]Binoculars.
[151:51.95]Walking along the corridor, I could hear my footsteps, my breathing, but also something else.
[151:56.71]A scraping sound coming from the darkness behind me.
[151:59.67]It ceased when I stopped to look around me, but now I can hear it again.
[152:02.89]Is that supposed to be a tutorial?
[152:06.66]That's a tutorial, right?
[152:08.24]What tutorial does that mean?
[152:14.06]Just don't look behind me and it won't happen.
[152:17.94]I want to make something very clear here.
[152:20.24]I am bumping into something right here.
[152:23.36]I cannot go back.
[152:24.18]I'm bumping into an object.
[152:32.35]She's literally right on me.
[152:35.07]I'm bumping into her back.
[152:36.65]I'm in like a fucking line at Disney World bumping into her.
[152:51.87]She's right there.
[152:59.61]Uh-huh, yep, yep, yep.
[153:18.16]Go ahead and just stay in there if you'd like.
[153:20.32]I'm trying to close the door.
[153:23.50]Just stay in there.
[153:24.40]You don't have to worry about me.
[153:28.48]I'm just gonna walk.
[153:29.23]I have an itchy eyeball.
[153:47.80]Ah!
[153:50.63]She's going to be behind me, and she's just going to jump, and it's going to scare me.
[154:00.50]Ah, shit.
[154:07.46]It's a big room.
[154:21.00]I'm like a shuffling old man.
[154:28.57]I didn't.
[154:55.80]Jeez, right fucking there.
[155:19.76]I'm not looking.
[155:31.05]She might be in one of the... I've got an itchy ass.
[155:32.84]Hold on.
[155:39.78]Isn't he going to stand up?
[155:48.38]Why did I wake up alone?
[155:49.40]I have no answer.
[155:50.36]My head still hurts, so perhaps I stayed unconscious for too long, but they wouldn't have waited for me.
[155:54.71]That is, unless they couldn't stay here.
[155:56.35]Oh, fuck off, lady.
[155:59.47]That's fine.
[156:00.07]I'll just stay over here.
[156:09.08]Can I see, like, a shadow behind me?
[156:36.44]I can't- I can't move.
[156:39.06]Can I- Begone!
[156:50.43]Ah, shit.
[156:51.73]Okay, where's the... Okay, you can go down here.
[157:05.43]Ah!
[157:29.23]What?
[157:30.97]This creature moves when you look away.
[157:33.64]Don't turn your back to it.
[157:36.04]I thought I was supposed to put my back towards the creature.
[157:41.28]What?
[157:45.57]So the thing was just glued to me the whole time?
[157:53.89]So I have to stare at that lady.
[157:57.85]I'm sitting there, like, backing up.
[158:00.11]She's just, like, dancing behind me.
[158:03.41]Oh, man, that was... Oh, God.
[158:11.79]There's more than one.
[158:14.25]Oh, that's unbelievable.
[158:15.69]The whole thing's computer-generated, right?
[158:21.82]The whole thing is just computer-generated.
[158:23.28]Alright, where are you guys?
[158:24.18]I want to make sure I'm in the right spot.
[158:35.50]God damn it.
[158:38.97]So, I did find the other eyes.
[158:40.37]I was down.
[158:44.25]God.
[158:44.79]Alright, let's go.
[158:50.08]I knew she was in the room, too.
[158:51.42]Oh, that hurt my whole body.
[158:58.20]There's gotta be another eye.
[158:59.34]Alright, I gotta stare right at the lady.
[159:04.43]I hate that mechanic.
[159:07.25]I hate this mechanic.
[159:08.35]I don't like this mechanic.
[159:14.15]Okay, stare at her.
[159:15.04]Right, stare at her face.
[159:16.06]Come here, lady.
[159:17.76]I don't want any trouble with you.
[159:20.74]Where the fuck is she?
[159:26.12]It's just pillows.
[159:57.11]No, dude, no, no, no.
[159:59.19]Humans weren't supposed to be doing this shit.
[160:12.74]Where are you?
[160:13.36]Where are you?
[160:14.04]Where are you?
[160:14.52]Hello?
[160:17.44]Yup, you're over here somewhere.
[160:22.94]Humans aren't supposed to be doing this.
[160:42.43]Fuck.
[160:43.41]Fuck.
[160:45.63]I looked!
[160:47.05]I looked!
[160:47.51]I looked at you!
[160:48.19]I'm looking at you right now!
[160:49.47]I'm looking at you right now!
[160:53.13]Like food just came up out of my, into my mouth.
[160:59.35]Like old food.
[161:00.95]I just like puked.
[161:09.70]I just tasted, I don't know, I just tasted tobacco.
[161:24.10]How?
[161:29.30]Was I eating cigarettes in my sleep?
[161:31.28]There's nothing even back here.
[161:36.09]Fuck.
[161:38.75]I gotta go down that hall.
[161:48.76]Oh shit, in my pants.
[161:50.22]I think she's behind me.
[161:51.04]I gotta look at her.
[161:52.82]Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
[162:07.43]Hey there! Hey there!
[162:09.60]Don't you dare get out of that... You bastard, you!
[162:17.16]I'm looking at you!
[162:18.48]I'm looking at you!
[162:19.62]I'm looking at you!
[162:20.95]Huh?
[162:30.56]It's the wrong monster.
[162:37.20]You shouldn't have looked at her.
[162:47.32]Don't look at the lady.
[162:48.96]Look at the other one.
[162:56.18]I thought they were both ladies.
[163:00.58]I don't do well in this environment, man.
[163:02.15]I got both the headphones in.
[163:03.33]I'm like fucking, I'm eating cigarettes in my sleep.
[163:30.33]Alright, I'm gonna just do it.
[163:39.17]It's like sweat all over my mouth.
[163:41.53]Are you gonna give me a weapon?
[163:46.21]Come on, am I getting Luigi?
[163:49.18]Sid, he was the one who told me about the Forgotten.
[163:52.80]And this place.
[163:53.68]He didn't want to come, not at first, but I convinced him.
[163:56.40]I wanted to see it, I needed to.
[164:01.16]points.
[164:01.42]Look at how big this map is.
[164:15.07]So this... Don't look at Lady.
[164:21.05]Look at the... The smoke monster?
[164:24.17]So...
[164:36.38]Is there any other monsters that I need to have tutorials on?
[164:41.46]But they both look like they could be headed to dust.
[164:44.82]Ugh.
[164:50.54]Standing around and... Okay, is that the dust or is that her?
[164:52.90]Is it dust or... A magic staff.
[165:08.85]What does it mean?
[165:09.75]What does it do?
[165:11.15]Take me.
[165:40.90]I have no idea what that does.
[165:50.70]I feel like this is important.
[166:06.05]Should I do something with that?
[166:06.99]What is the point?
[166:07.41]Nothing here.
[166:07.89]Alright, bye.
[166:40.63]Is this a safe room?
[166:41.55]Can I come back here if... I have another clue.
[166:51.16]I'm going in here.
[166:59.21]Don't look at Lady, look at the dust cloud.
[167:02.37]And do I have to run from Lady?
[167:19.39]The hallway's connected and it just causes me so much fucking stress.
[167:26.24]I don't know what that is.
[167:27.24]I don't know what that is.
[167:28.80]Something's crawling.
[167:33.72]I don't know what that is.
[167:35.86]Somebody's crawling on the ceiling.
[167:37.50]Somebody's crawling on the ceiling.
[167:39.76]I don't know.
[167:43.24]Fuck.
[167:44.96]That's horrible.
[167:55.66]God damn it, I don't know what it is.
[167:57.42]God damn it, it's a lady.
[167:58.36]Don't look at the lady.
[168:00.18]God damn it.
[168:01.90]God damn it.
[168:04.44]God damn it.
[168:07.05]God damn it.
[168:09.65]God.
[168:11.35]God!
[168:11.73]Is that a guy?
[168:12.15]Is that a boss?
[168:14.87]Is it a boss?
[168:15.77]Is it a skeleton or a boss?
[168:17.99]I don't know.
[168:18.69]I don't know.
[168:19.05]Just sit here.
[168:19.49]No, I'm not.
[168:19.87]I gotta move.
[168:20.39]Where am I gonna go?
[168:21.21]Is it a dust cloud?
[168:21.85]Is it a dust cloud behind me?
[168:25.50]This is unbearable.
[168:27.02]Holy shit.
[168:28.93]Come on, give me the eye.
[168:30.81]No, another dead end.
[168:31.97]Shit.
[168:38.07]Is that the lady or is it the smoke man?
[168:41.09]That's a smoke guy, right?
[168:43.97]Stare at the smoke.
[168:50.64]Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, out, out, out, out, out.
[169:01.65]Okay.
[169:03.65]Do you go away?
[169:09.27]Okay.
[169:10.09]Mission accomplished.
[169:11.67]I think.
[169:18.48]No, no, no.
[169:19.56]How dare you come out now?
[169:21.48]How dare you come out now?
[169:34.63]Is that a person?
[169:35.17]I don't know.
[169:36.03]Wait a minute.
[169:36.47]Is that a thing?
[169:36.95]What is that thing?
[169:46.23]Ay-ya-ya-ya!
[169:47.79]I was never scared of small places, but the walls of these narrow corners seem to be sobering me to other types of feel.
[169:52.27]I can't breathe.
[169:52.89]Yeah, fine.
[169:57.20]Fuck.
[169:58.44]Oh, fuck.
[170:05.57]I don't know if it's the lady or if it's the smoke.
[170:13.93]Is that the smoke?
[170:14.43]It's the smoke!
[170:14.97]It's smoke, I think, right?
[170:15.83]Is it smoke?
[170:16.55]Is it smoke?
[170:18.15]Is that smoke?
[170:19.33]Is that smoke?
[170:22.61]It's smoke!
[170:24.23]Oh, I hate this.
[170:38.85]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[170:43.47]Okay, straight ahead.
[170:44.11]I hear another fucking person.
[170:48.56]I don't give a shit about money.
[170:51.92]I don't care about money.
[170:55.08]Can I turn that?
[170:55.92]Can I please pull this?
[170:57.60]Sir?
[170:57.86]I hear him again.
[171:00.97]Don't you dare.
[171:03.03]You get down.
[171:04.53]Back to hell.
[171:09.89]Why can I not pull that?
[171:22.18]I have to go to, like, the doctor after this.
[171:29.42]So why can I not pull this?
[171:38.79]Come on, where is this damn thing?
[171:40.13]I gotta go left and then down this hall.
[171:54.82]Okay, here's what I need you guys to do for me.
[171:56.03]I need you guys to scream in the chat if it's Lady or Smoke, because my brain, I can't do it.
[172:07.56]Okay, you understand?
[172:08.70]Is that lady or smoke?
[172:09.72]Which one is it?
[172:14.24]Is that lady or smoke?
[172:15.02]Which one is that one?
[172:19.14]Is it lady?
[172:29.35]Is it smoke?
[172:31.19]I hear something.
[172:33.23]Is it smoke?
[172:33.57]Is it smoke?
[172:39.11]I'm fucking panicking right now.
[172:40.39]This is so bad.
[172:45.97]I don't know.
[172:53.11]Don't listen to chat.
[172:54.01]Hi, I... The sweat is fogging up these mirrors.
[173:07.20]Fucker.
[173:09.58]You fucker.
[173:18.72]Almost there, almost there, almost there, almost there, almost there.
[173:21.61]I'm there.
[173:34.35]Hey, hey, hey.
[173:49.04]It's a smoke person.
[173:49.78]I think it's a smoke person.
[173:53.48]I'm not cut out for these games.
[173:59.91]There it is.
[174:00.25]I tapped something.
[174:04.75]What did I tap?
[174:05.25]What happened?
[174:08.13]Is this what I wanted when I decided to come here?
[174:09.70]This is a horrible place.
[174:10.68]I always knew it would be.
[174:11.46]Why am I here?
[174:15.62]An exit.
[174:20.04]I'm going.
[174:20.92]Am I out?
[174:21.82]Is this wind?
[174:32.51]I missed oil.
[174:33.69]It's alright.
[174:34.17]I'm gonna be missing some fucking brain cells after this one.
[174:42.21]I'm too like neurotic of a person to play these games.
[174:57.97]There's two more to do.
[175:00.45]I think I'm just going to go, like I said before, with the original tactic of just run as fast as I can to the exit.
[175:11.28]I feel like that's going to be a good idea.
[175:18.26]Good luck.
[175:21.62]My back hurts right now from just, like, tense.
[175:25.31]I'm going to have to go get a massage.
[175:29.56]Oh, you have a lot of tension.
[175:31.22]Wow, is this from work?
[175:34.46]Uh, I mean, maybe.
[175:36.26]Oh, wow.
[175:36.70]Do you like construction?
[175:39.62]Do you sit down for a long time?
[175:42.18]No, I was playing a VR game on Twitch.
[175:45.46]I was playing a horror game.
[175:47.96]Oh.
[175:49.06]Yeah, that's what I did for work.
[175:52.35]That's fucking kind of weird, but okay.
[175:57.15]Do a Naruto run into the entrance.
[175:58.79]Sure.
[176:08.24]No, it's the other.
[176:08.80]Hold on.
[176:21.36]There you go.
[176:37.10]Fuck it, it's time to go.
[177:21.68]Fuck you, fuck you!
[177:23.80]It's a lady, it's a lady.
[177:48.87]I need to not look at the lady, look at the statue.
[177:52.41]You look at the statue.
[177:53.43]Don't tell me to look at the statue that's right here.
[177:55.93]The statue... Oh, you look at the statue that's right there.
[177:59.74]You know, the fucking monster that's going to jump in your face because you looked at the statue.
[178:37.16]Oh man, that thing.
[178:40.02]He got off the pedestal, right?
[178:41.60]That's what this is.
[179:01.22]Punch it.
[179:04.50]Who's doing that one?
[179:05.34]Am I going to get crowded by monsters?
[179:08.25]I have to move.
[179:08.83]I gotta move.
[179:09.39]But I don't know what that means if I turn around.
[179:10.73]Is he going to follow me?
[179:12.03]I don't know.
[179:13.19]I don't understand if I leave this room if he's going to follow me behind me.
[179:16.90]I don't know what to do here.
[179:17.70]I'm so fucking... I don't know.
[179:18.82]The door's open here.
[179:44.33]Okay, I'm gonna say left.
[179:51.61]Okay, fuck you, bye.
[180:02.20]Don't look at the lady, look at the smoke, and look at the statue guy.
[180:06.74]Is he behind me fucking crawling?
[180:09.60]Oh, God.
[180:12.96]Go, go, go, go, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out!
[180:17.00]Oil, oil, oil, oil in the can, go go go.
[180:24.00]Oh you bitch! No!
[180:31.00]Is this the same room?
[180:35.00]I got it. Get me out.
[180:43.00]God.
[180:51.40]Only one more and I get the prize.
[181:02.39]What the hell was that?
[181:03.05]This is it, one more.
[181:07.67]I get the final prize.
[181:21.68]This game's crazy.
[181:31.41]Look in that door.
[181:39.01]Why?
[181:39.19]I've already been down there.
[181:45.76]Don't, don't.
[181:46.58]Your fly is down.
[181:47.42]I don't have a fly right now.
[181:50.02]I'm wearing workout pants.
[181:52.76]Alright, let's go.
[182:00.93]Am I getting a shield?
[182:09.34]Do I have a shield?
[182:13.70]That's a huge shield.
[182:21.24]So let me just clarify this one more time.
[182:25.07]The statue... I gotta look at that statue.
[182:29.31]You guys are not just fucking with me.
[182:30.51]That's a real monster.
[182:36.33]Okay.
[182:39.67]Okay, just wanna make sure.
[182:41.46]So I gotta burn smoke guy, don't look at lady, look at statue.
[182:52.23]It's hard for me to tell.
[182:53.57]I'm going to have to wipe down this visor.
[182:57.03]It's so dirty from my sweat.
[183:13.32]Give me like a lucky break right here.
[183:14.72]It's right here.
[183:15.30]I don't even care.
[183:21.59]I hear something.
[183:22.17]Is that the gargoyle?
[183:32.74]That sounds like a gargoyle.
[183:43.18]WHAT THE FUCK IS THE- WHAT AM I DOING ABOUT THE GIANT DOG?! !
[184:09.16]This has been like a YouTuber scream stream.
[184:16.76]This has been just like, welcome to my YouTube channel.
[184:19.52]I scream at horror games.
[184:22.69]Thankfully, thank God I'm standing up in a position where I'm away from the microphone.
[184:26.81]The mic would have peaked like 16 times tonight.
[184:30.19]Thank God it's bouncing off the walls.
[184:35.43]That guy was huge.
[184:37.41]Oh, that sucked.
[184:41.27]Fuck man, that thing's ridiculous.
[184:44.95]Where's the right way to look?
[184:45.83]God damn it, that thing is so scary.
[184:54.41]It's so much bigger than everything too.
[184:56.44]And this is all procedurally generated.
[185:04.54]Now that I know he exists, I don't want to play anymore.
[185:38.44]Is he coming down this hall?
[185:44.05]I think he's behind me.
[185:47.03]Hello?
[185:51.57]Somebody's opened a door.
[185:53.67]Can he open doors?
[185:55.29]Can he open doors?
[185:57.65]Shh, calm down.
[186:11.78]Gonna hate these little rooms.
[186:12.82]Gotta come out here being bright.
[186:20.65]Can you open doors?
[186:21.17]Do you hear something?
[186:45.79]Shit!
[186:46.76]Shit, man!
[187:23.87]Okay, it's gonna be right here to the left.
[187:26.29]It's gonna be in this room.
[187:31.04]Damn it!
[187:32.22]It's not in there.
[187:33.58]I don't even want to go in there.
[187:37.56]It's gonna be right in here.
[187:38.44]Right to the left and right in this room.
[187:46.04]Motherfucker.
[187:48.45]Oh, thank God.
[187:49.07]It's one of those sanctuary rooms.
[187:51.45]Oh, yes.
[187:53.03]I'm safe in here, right?
[187:57.73]Thank God.
[188:08.12]I just heard a person.
[188:10.43]I just heard a person.
[188:12.49]Are we certain of this?
[188:19.21]Why'd I hear somebody's voice?
[188:22.81]Alright, come on, it's right in here.

[188:57.58]Don't do me like this.
[188:58.58]I hear something.
[189:18.70]Bullshit!
[189:19.16]That's a lady, right?
[189:27.74]No, what does that mean?
[189:28.46]I don't know what that thing means.
[189:30.14]I don't know what that thing means.
[189:32.39]I think that's like a- it attracts people.
[189:35.51]I think it attract- no, that attracts a bad person.
[189:39.67]Oh fuck.
[189:40.39]Oh fuck, is it the smoke?
[189:42.07]I think it's smoke.
[189:49.85]Is it smoke?
[189:51.83]I think the smoke guy is literally right behind me.
[189:54.03]I think it's smoke.
[189:56.35]I don't know what to do.
[189:57.15]I'm scared.
[189:57.71]I'm not gonna answer it.
[189:58.57]Just give me the keys.
[190:00.99]Just give me the keys.
[190:02.69]Just give me the fucking keys.
[190:03.42]Where are the keys?
[190:04.48]Just give me the keys.
[190:05.90]I've looked everywhere.
[190:06.94]Where are the goddamn keys?
[190:08.58]Where are the goddamn keys?
[190:09.28]I don't even know what I'm looking at here.
[190:17.75]What the fuck is this?
[190:40.63]How dare you?
[190:41.95]How dare you?
[190:45.11]Look at him!
[190:48.93]No, burn him!
[190:49.97]What the fuck?
[191:00.36]What happened?
[191:02.92]What happened?
[191:09.69]I was holding the lantern to his face.
[191:19.34]Was there no oil in the lamp?
[191:20.52]Not enough oil?
[191:21.14]Didn't I just fill it?
[191:24.92]Oh, my God.
[191:33.78]Damn, there was more blood.
[191:41.89]Shadows don't care.
[191:43.53]It needs to be refilled immediately.
[191:50.94]I checked so many places too.
[191:54.34]That whole map was uncovered.
[191:56.01]I only had the two places I didn't go.
[191:59.21]I got destroyed.
[192:01.81]Gotta talk to the face on the wall.
[192:07.34]This thing.
[192:18.75]Pay two coins.
[192:19.75]But what?
[192:20.51]What am I paying for?
[192:23.07]You have 21 old coins.
[192:24.14]You have to pay the price.
[192:43.37]It was you who stepped into the darkness.
[192:46.31]It was you who chose to be bound by it.
[192:49.47]You are nothing but their pawn.
[192:52.51]Did this cost me two dollars for that?
[192:59.46]Now you're gonna go in a shell?
[193:03.82]There's two bucks.
[193:13.84]Okay.
[193:17.60]Ah, so close too.
[193:19.58]Damn.
[193:21.63]Damn, I had it.
[193:22.95]Oh, I had it.
[193:23.67]It was so much stress, but I almost did it.
[193:25.45]I was almost ready.
[193:26.13]I was almost out of there.
[193:31.37]Which way am I?
[193:31.91]I gotta make sure I'm in the right spot here.
[193:38.98]I forgot it was dark in this room.
[193:41.96]Alright, let's just start here.
[193:45.37]I'm gonna try again.
[193:46.37]I felt something just on my neck, but it's my sweat.
[193:49.95]A sweat bead just went down the back of my neck, and I thought it was a bug.
[193:56.79]Jesus.
[193:57.23]Can I talk to this thing?
[194:04.20]No, this thing doesn't want to speak to me.
[194:05.44]Alright.
[194:10.24]Why are we so close?
[194:19.87]Just let me get lucky here.
[194:28.10]What if I just hold my fist?
[194:37.07]Where is it?
[194:50.97]Oh my fucking Jesus, my God!
[194:52.94]You can't get in here!
[195:27.05]No, come on, just give me the key and let me get out of this fucking place.
[195:47.18]Where's that dog again?
[195:48.34]Where's that darn dog?
[195:52.86]Whoa.
[195:56.04]Okay, I think the lady's in here with me.
[195:58.00]Close the door.
[195:59.14]Just leave me the fuck alone.
[196:06.69]I can't believe it.
[196:08.25]I can't believe it that she's in here.
[196:14.57]Ugh.
[196:21.57]And is there a smoke monster that can spawn in here as well?
[196:24.37]You've got to be fucking shitting me, sir.
[196:31.70]Okay, well that was fun at the party.
[196:33.44]The fucking scary people.
[196:38.12]Scary people party.
[196:39.02]That was fun of us to go out and hang out here.
[197:00.92]A full squad just landed on me.
[197:05.68]I have to go that way.
[197:10.03]I have to go this way.
[197:10.99]Give me another doorway, please.
[197:21.18]Sanctuary room.
[197:24.12]Shower me with light in the sanctuary room of our father!
[197:30.27]Thank God.
[197:35.15]What the hell do you want to tell me, lady?
[197:41.47]What is your question?
[197:46.22]About the coins.
[197:47.34]Tokens of devotion.
[197:50.12]What?
[197:50.50]What?
[197:50.92]What?
[197:51.50]What?

[197:58.08]What is it?
[197:58.64]What?
[197:59.06]Something in my sanctuary room?
[198:01.72]Something in my sanctuary room?
[198:04.89]Is it the lady?
[198:07.57]What are you doing in my fucking room?

[198:45.39]This is the most stressed I've ever been.
[198:48.31]It's the fucking lady again.
[198:49.51]They're just like dumping on me.
[198:50.69]They're collapsing on me.
[198:52.57]What the hell is that?
[198:54.51]Light in the lantern.
[198:55.31]I don't even know the light.
[198:57.61]Left trigger, turn the light back on.
[198:59.01]What the fuck is happening?
[199:02.37]Why is this happening to me?
[199:05.09]They're relentless.
[199:07.21]They are relentless.
[199:11.33]I think I've had enough fun.
[199:14.61]I think it's time for me to do something else.
[199:18.47]I'm going to go take a bath.
[199:21.43]God damn it.

[200:51.40]About yourself.

[201:04.09]I'd rather just like sell these tokens on eBay.
[201:09.79]Here we go.
[201:14.51]You can probably get like a hundred bucks per token.
[201:17.73]Some ancient artifact.

[201:20.36]Alright.
[201:20.58]Well, let's see what's in store here.

[202:19.55]All the wanderers just like you.
[202:22.15]Judged unworthy.
[202:23.77]Devoured by the shadows.
[202:25.65]Okay.
[202:27.07]Now it's three coins.
[202:32.39]Your price went up.
[202:35.96]What the hell?

[203:25.77]Hope you guys enjoyed it.
[203:42.42]Give me some oil or something.

[204:03.91]Doesn't look like it.
[204:08.75]It is a new hub world.
[204:13.96]Oh no.
[204:16.89]This game is 10 hours.
[204:19.63]What?

[204:32.29]Yeah, I'm done.
[204:35.03]I can only take so much of this in one sitting.

[204:54.76]Look at how much bigger the areas are.
[204:57.64]This is times two.
[205:01.62]The amount of stress.

[211:37.51]Why did you just tell me to do that?
[211:42.25]What the hell is that guy?
[211:43.21]There he is.
[211:44.06]How do I pull it out?

[212:49.06]I'm gone forever.
[212:53.11]Right through this door.

[213:19.99]Don't leave me alone.
[213:22.27]What's this say?
[213:23.11]An ear-piercing scream suddenly filled the dungeon while I was sleeping.
[213:25.11]It took me a few seconds to realize it was mine.
[213:27.60]Get off the screen.
[213:29.06]Look at how far away this took me.
[213:30.50]I don't care.
[213:33.76]Son of a... God damn it.
[213:35.74]I have to go all the way back.
[213:37.72]Procedurally random generated.
[213:56.71]Do these things attack?

[217:37.60]You motherfucker, just pretend I beat it.
[217:38.80]I don't know what it is.
[217:43.84]Ah, that's a thing, that's a thing, that's a thing, that's a thing, what is that thing?
[217:48.34]I don't, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, should I stop moving?
[217:51.32]I don't know what it is, I'm just gonna duck.
[218:08.93]Fuck you guys.
[218:10.73]Fuck you.
[218:11.95]You can't do this to me.
[218:14.26]You can't do this to me.
[218:18.32]Look at how close I am.
[218:23.60]One more little bit right here.
[218:29.33]Oh my god, I win.
[218:30.09]I beat the game.
[218:32.49]Open.
[218:33.59]Open?
[218:41.69]Jesus.
[218:49.24]I stuck it through and I did it.
[218:58.07]That's the end.
[218:59.61]I'll see the ending cutscene, please.
[219:02.67]Hey, the ending cutscene, give it to me.
[219:20.32]I hope this is the end.
[220:15.41]Is it an eyeball?
[220:18.75]I thought you guys told me that was the end of the game.
[220:42.63]Is this supposed to be like a cutscene, like the ending cutscene?
[220:45.51]I don't know.
[220:45.99]I mean, it looks pretty linear.
[221:05.70]Only two more!
[221:06.82]New hub, two more, two more!
[221:08.77]No.
[221:10.67]No, I gotta get out of here.
[221:11.99]I gotta get out of that.
[221:18.23]That game is a ton of fun, and it's so stressful.
[221:22.66]But... Oh, I can't do that anymore.
[221:25.80]It's gonna actually kill me.
[221:29.92]Ugh.
[221:35.24]So we're going to move on.
[221:36.42]We're probably going to end on... I was going to play Mindshow, but I don't know if I'm going to have enough time to do it.
[221:42.40]I'm going to have to start with Mindshow.
[221:45.78]Because I've exhausted myself.
[221:47.58]I'm going to have to start with Mindshow another day.
[221:51.40]No, Mindshow, not Minecraft.
[222:02.80]Let me take another break.
[222:03.56]I'm just going to get some more water thrown in my face.
[222:08.26]And we'll come back and we might just play the boxing game for like a little while.
[222:15.63]I'll be right back.
[222:20.09]What?
[222:20.29]Is something in here?
[222:36.82]I don't see anything.
[222:40.21]No.
[222:41.47]Alright, I'll see you guys in a minute.
[222:47.30]I can't believe I've tracked the game.
[222:51.54]Oh, here.
[222:52.48]There.
[226:39.99]Okay.
[226:41.71]Hello again.
[226:46.92]We are now going to jump into... Oh, let's see.
[226:54.76]Something like easy and relaxing.
[227:00.24]Although, I'm not entirely sure that the boxing game will be very relaxing.
[227:08.49]Let's do it.
[227:12.49]What the hell is it there?
[227:13.13]It's Creed.
[227:18.34]This looks really fun, actually.
[227:33.26]Ugh.
[227:36.03]So, I can't even remember what I was even saying during that stream.
[227:38.91]Hopefully that was an interesting experience for all of you.
[227:45.65]Have I done SUPERHOT?
[227:46.35]Yeah, I did SUPERHOT VR last week.
[227:53.55]Let's try Creed.
[228:01.78]Alright.
[228:03.68]Don't want to back in.
[228:17.04]Should I turn the lights back up?
[228:18.66]I probably should.
[228:22.62]Yeah, let me turn the lights on.
[228:23.98]A little bit higher than they are now.
[228:31.23]That's better.
[228:38.99]That looks good.
[228:48.96]So I heard this game is pretty realistic.
[228:52.52]It really feels like you're fighting.
[229:22.17]So press any button to calibrate.
[229:24.31]What the fuck?
[229:26.67]Uh, that, that's not correct.
[229:30.82]That doesn't look right.
[229:33.00]Hold on.
[229:36.10]What happened there?
[229:41.91]Stop stream, end of the stream.
[229:43.95]I think that's better.
[229:51.22]Hey, look, there we go.
[229:52.70]That's odd.
[229:53.78]This is also pretty loud.
[229:59.36]Okay.
[230:01.78]Alright.
[230:02.39]Career.
[230:03.07]Free play.
[230:04.19]Options.
[230:05.15]Am I standing in a good spot?
[230:09.15]Okay.
[230:10.33]Gameplay.
[230:10.89]Graphics.
[230:11.45]Gameplay.

[230:13.01]Reset profile.
[230:13.74]Advanced locomotion.
[230:16.36]What does that mean?
[230:27.23]Yeah, I know it's x2, don't worry.
[230:33.06]Alright.
[230:42.00]Uh, gameplay.
[230:42.58]Let's just go through it.
[230:46.54]Career.
[230:48.84]Pro.
[230:55.39]I probably should change the title too, I didn't.
[230:58.74]7 Months Before Underground Championship.
[231:03.02]Oh, this is cool.
[231:04.42]I thought that was me.
[231:05.88]Actually me.
[231:08.04]Hold the trackpad while swinging your arms.
[231:17.49]Okay.
[231:22.01]Anything else you'd like to tell me?
[231:28.02]Punch, punch harder for more damage.
[231:35.98]I gotta hit harder than that.
[231:42.50]I gotta hit harder than that.
[231:44.04]What's good, man?
[231:48.04]Hey, I was thinking maybe I could come down to the gym.
[231:50.48]Maybe you could show me some moves.
[231:52.44]These are gonna fly off.
[231:54.22]Man, I heard all that.
[231:55.65]This is kind of cutting out the circulation.
[232:01.41]How am I using a cell phone with these on?
[232:13.17]Come on in.
[232:13.61]Teach me.
[232:15.75]Hey, there he is.
[232:17.67]Let me show you what I can do.
[232:21.47]No!
[232:21.59]Huh?
[232:22.41]I just used all my energy.
[232:23.49]I don't think I can even make it over there.
[232:31.07]What?
[232:31.49]Oh, okay, hold on.
[232:33.45]Whoa!
[232:44.76]Let's go, train me.
[232:50.10]I gotta tie this.
[232:50.70]This is gonna be tighter.
[232:53.67]I'm gonna move around so much, this is gonna be bad.
[232:58.53]This is gonna fly off my head.
[233:10.29]Okay, defend with gloves.
[233:14.43]Sounds easy enough.
[233:21.16]Dodge punches to trigger slow-mo.
[233:22.90]I'm gonna see you guys every time.
[233:26.26]Dodge punches to trigger slow-mo.
[233:30.96]Do I have enough room?
[233:33.58]I will break something here.
[233:34.82]When we're done, the fight will be the easiest part of all of this.
[233:40.05]Finish exercise as quick as possible, okay.
[233:43.65]Stand in the center of your play space.
[233:50.65]Counting down.
[233:53.99]Rapidly hit the tarp.
[234:03.61]Swing.
[234:07.97]This is like happening too fast.
[234:18.51]Come on, bring it on.
[234:22.45]I wanted a relaxing game.
[234:52.13]Oh no, not enough oxygen is going into his brain.
[234:54.35]I'm fine, don't worry.
[235:25.51]First combatant.
[235:30.73]You think you're gonna take on me?
[235:33.65]He's 0 and 12.
[235:34.47]Well.
[235:36.69]What do you got?
[235:42.43]Huh?
[235:45.03]You're gonna rip that off the bottom of your chin.
[235:48.47]Do we get, are you?
[235:49.11]Keep this above the belt and inside the ring, ready?
[235:51.71]The fight starts as soon as you touch gloves.
[235:53.69]Okay.
[235:55.57]As soon as we touch gloves.
[235:57.65]Here we go, boxing fans.
[235:59.21]The moment you've all been waiting for.
[236:04.31]What a shot.
[236:05.40]Creed really showing off his power with that blow.
[236:22.14]Some impressive speed with another dodge.
[236:55.29]That's not how you box.
[236:57.70]That's not how you box.
[237:00.56]I would get thrown out of the gym.
[237:04.16]I'm trying to get him in the stomach.
[237:09.59]That's not how you... I would get tossed.
[237:27.60]Damage root.
[238:10.86]How is he gonna go out?
[238:12.84]What?
[238:13.04]Whoa, whoa, what did I hit?
[238:39.00]Heading into the next round, Creed has a clear advantage on the other fighter.
[238:43.77]I'm gonna go for the legs.
[238:47.63]Where am I going?
[239:14.69]I just beat the shit out of his head.
[239:15.83]How are you still alive?
[239:47.38]Ah!
[239:48.50]You wanna come fuck with me?

[245:55.80]Reed showing some great technique with that blow.
[246:57.28]I'm losing audio.
[247:00.94]Man, that was close.
[247:06.09]Reed scores a quick hit.
[247:07.75]A light touch like that isn't about to knock anyone out.
[247:14.97]Hold on.
[247:17.03]I gotta put my headphones back.

[248:16.90]Oh man.
[248:27.69]I'm gonna be so sloppy in the next fight.
[248:31.83]This is not fair.
[248:41.05]Typically, I... Typically, if you fight in a boxing match, you don't fight again ten minutes later.
[248:46.34]Takes like six months to recover.
[249:04.20]What do you got for me?
[249:05.50]More training?
[249:06.00]Oh, God.
[249:49.76]I just don't have like a McDonald's rating.
[249:51.78]That's all I care about.
[249:53.81]No McDonald's rating and I'll be fine.

[263:48.99]Either way, Bobby Nash is now recovering.
[263:51.35]They say he has a broken jaw, possibly some permanent damage to his eye.
[263:55.23]He's not in any state to fight for at least half a year.
[263:58.32]Well, hopefully he's alright.

[269:23.23]Reboot it.
[269:25.97]Eh, don't matter.
[269:26.81]All we need is the visual.
[269:27.61]Hey, my week's been pretty good.
[269:35.17]You don't have a game window to focus on.
[269:38.53]Wait, what?
[269:43.77]Should be focusing on it now.
[269:44.83]I hear it.
[269:47.74]I can hear it, I think.
[269:53.28]Yup.
[269:56.02]Oh, thank god.
[270:06.80]So yeah, I think this is going to be it.
[270:10.00]I'm fucking dying right now.

[270:18.90]It was close.
[270:23.35]What a great post-workout game, yeah.
[270:27.27]Can somebody look up how much this was?
[270:39.61]It's called a Feehar River Relaxation.
[270:48.63]It's a relaxing kayak ride with Jeff.
[270:52.94]You're about to go down a waterfall.
[270:54.34]No, that wouldn't be very relaxing.
[270:56.00]Oh, it's $4.
[270:59.16]Never mind.
[271:04.90]No, there's no waterfall.
[271:05.99]This is just like a tech demo.
[271:08.09]It actually is kind of making me a little nauseous.
[271:13.81]We're gonna die.
[271:21.53]It's going too fast.
[271:26.93]Oh.
[271:29.48]Oh my god.
[271:33.08]Use the cans?
[271:53.05]This is... Come on, man.
[272:03.70]Okay.
[272:06.30]Have we just gone in a circle?
[272:11.83]Wake me up when the next stream starts.
[272:22.32]Ugh.
[272:23.48]The horror game and then the Creed game just absolutely fucking destroyed me.
[272:33.43]Keep playing until the waterfall?
[272:34.71]There ain't gonna be a waterfall.
[272:38.71]Nice dirty socks.
[272:41.65]They're not dirty.
[272:42.35]These are fucking clean.
[272:45.14]They just don't match.
[272:50.40]Ugh.
[272:52.95]That boxing match was a horror game too.
[273:00.82]Oh my god.
[273:01.92]Yeah, I'm gonna have to call it here.
[273:03.42]I can barely fucking even move.
[273:06.66]It's gonna be hard to even get out of this boat.
[273:18.98]Uh, so Saturday, Star and I are gonna do VR.
[273:23.80]Just sleep on the ground.
[273:26.18]Alright, let me hold on.
[273:29.22]So, uh, the stream is over, by the way.
[273:30.79]Just wanna make that really clear.
[273:32.89]Stream's over.
[273:34.93]Uh, so if you feel like leaving, I'll see you soon.
[273:38.07]Saturday, me and Star are gonna play some co-op VR.
[273:40.93]But I'm just gonna fucking lie down in the kayak and pretend to sleep.
[273:48.47]So if you take it off, see you soon.
[275:20.61]Oh shit, there's a waterfall.
[275:28.11]This is nice.

[277:08.90]Come on, where is it?
[277:20.73]That's gonna be it for tonight.
[277:22.99]We'll do the bits.
[277:27.20]I'm fucking destroyed.
[277:30.69]It was the horror game just sucked out every ounce of energy I had.
[277:36.05]Every single molecule of energy.
[277:45.55]You want to see my face?
[277:47.07]Okay, here.
[277:47.43]Let's take a look.
[277:55.33]This is somebody I like was just in like a fire.

[281:09.95]Popcorn or pretzel?
[281:14.63]That's tough.
[281:15.23]Probably pretzel.
[281:18.56]Pretzels are just... They're so versatile.
[281:22.48]I mean, you could put sugar and cheese on popcorn.
[281:27.39]But you could turn pretzels into bread.
[281:30.21]You can make them crunchy.
[281:34.21]They can do a lot more.
[281:37.11]I love popcorn, though.
[281:38.21]I do love it.
[281:42.62]Mr. Kool-Aid, thanks for the $4, Mr. Kool-Aid.
[281:45.98]Hey, Dermot, since February is a short month, can I get my subscription pro-rated?

[282:28.61]I was in a very dark place long ago, and your pep talk in the Master of Comedy about figuring out what to do at any age really broke me out of it a bit and motivated me.
[282:40.32]I genuinely believe you're one of the greatest internet entertainers ever.
[282:43.34]Thank you so much for being you.
[282:47.14]That's an incredibly fucking nice thing to say.
[282:49.20]Thank you, Stevie.

[286:39.74]Good luck.
[286:41.22]Good luck with this one.

[292:37.37]The well is running dry.

[292:43.38]You guys have bloopers.

[293:20.08]News reporter Mike Amor learned what an occupational hazard while shooting a story can be.
[293:24.34]He was standing beside a skate ramp when this happened.

[294:31.08]That is not the right video, but Rice has been suspended.
[294:55.25]Scandals happen all the time.
[295:00.06]The question is, how do democracies respond to those scandals?
[295:03.18]And what will it mean for the wider region?
[295:06.12]I think one of your children has just walked in.
[295:07.91]I mean, shifting sands in the region, do you think relations with the North may change?
[295:14.43]I would be surprised if they do.
[295:15.75]Pardon me.
[295:35.57]I'm gonna die.

[296:42.07]We love your content.
[296:43.15]I catch the streams, and he watches the VODs, but lately he keeps asking me what Meat Hub is.
[296:51.12]He says, you keep bringing it up.
[296:53.52]Uh-oh.
[296:55.42]I can't remember having you heard it before.
[296:57.83]Maybe it was that stream I missed with Vinny.
[297:00.29]Vinesauce.
[297:00.89]Anyways, thanks for all the laughs and keep up the terrific work.
[297:05.19]I've never even mentioned those two words.
[297:06.75]I don't think I've even said either one of those two words separately.
[297:15.54]Oh my god, that was fucking...
[297:20.06]It didn't say meat?
[297:21.62]Yeah.
[297:22.56]I've never said meat before.
[297:26.04]Thank you, Freudian Weapon, for the $2.50.

[297:35.93]I don't know why it tasted like tobacco.
[297:37.33]Thank you, Jess.
[297:37.87]You got it for the $2.50.
[297:38.85]Tobacco is a good source of vitamins.
[297:40.63]Don't forget a crunchy cigarette.
[297:43.09]Part of a balanced breakfast.
[297:44.39]This is not real medical advice.
[297:45.95]Do not listen to that.
[297:46.99]It's not actual medical advice.
[297:52.78]But thank you.
[297:57.54]Thank you to... Jess, you got it.
[298:03.99]For the $2.50.

[298:12.82]What?
[298:16.14]What?
[298:20.15]Is that for real?

[298:30.76]Thank you, Deus Forte, for the $2.50.
[298:32.12]Hey, buddy, looking very healthy today.

[298:40.75]Just thought I'd let you know that the Phoenix Wright Collection comes out on Steam on April 9th.
[298:44.47]Don't forget or I'll be sad.
[298:47.41]I will not.
[298:49.81]I'm looking forward to it.
[298:52.41]It has a Do You Want to Be a Millionaire game on it.
[298:54.43]Why?
[298:58.49]Happy birthday, Nebula Brand, by the way.
[299:00.02]Just caught it.

[299:26.19]Uh, thank you to GTX 1080 Quad SLI, just two minutes ago here, for the $250.
[299:33.68]Hey Jeremy, when's the next movie night?
[299:36.38]Also, are you going to play more Resident Evil 2?
[299:37.82]Yeah, I got, actually, me and the mods, we're talking about the encore night happening sooner rather than later.
[299:47.37]There's no music.
[299:48.17]Oh, shit.
[299:49.05]Whoops.
[299:51.75]Yeah, that's probably going to be put together fairly soon here.
[300:02.20]So you'll see that.
[300:04.30]I want to try to get that ready in the next couple of weeks.
[300:08.96]End music, sad face.
[300:12.86]But thank you, GTX 1080.
[300:16.50]Uh, that, the TJ, thank you, the TJ, for the five dollars.
[300:19.84]And they say, thank, gentlemen, I want to thank you for all that you do for me in the first, uh, thank you for what you do for me in the place I'm at mentally right now.
[300:29.65]Since I joined the military, life has been lonely, with little contact to family and friends.
[300:34.75]It's hard, but luckily I have something to look forward to when I get back from flying and get back from my deployments to Afghanistan.
[300:41.09]From a longtime fan, these bits are for you, fella.
[300:43.43]Get yourself something special.
[300:46.35]Thank you so much, TJ.
[300:52.01]We look forward to your return.
[300:55.87]Much love to you.
[300:56.45]Thank you so much.
[301:02.21]Take care of yourself.
[301:13.54]I love looking over here and seeing the chat.
[301:18.00]So supportive.
[301:18.80]So wonderful.
[301:19.44]Really, it's amazing.
[301:21.28]It's great stuff.
[301:28.11]Thank you to Shadows1Discipline for the $2.50.
[301:29.89]Jeremy, have you ever heard of a game called Road Trip Adventure on PlayStation 2?
[301:34.23]It's an RPG where you play as a car.
[301:39.01]I've never heard of that.
[301:39.99]That's interesting.
[301:42.66]A car RPG.
[301:46.20]Maybe we'll have to look into that.
[301:54.34]A car, a car PG, one would say.
[302:02.81]And look what's popping up here.
[302:04.71]All the subs.
[302:07.83]I was going to run this earlier.
[302:08.87]I just was so tired.
[302:11.35]Thank you, everybody.
[302:13.53]The massive amount of subs this channel takes in.
[302:15.93]You guys are fucking awesome.
[302:16.80]Thank you so much.
[302:27.44]Much love to y'all.
[302:29.76]And holy shit.
[302:32.66]Great Canadian Fuck Club just came in with a hundred bucks.
[302:35.12]Another hundred dollars from Great Canadian.
[302:40.55]Jerma makes me laugh.
[302:45.36]That's so much money.
[302:49.38]You've given so much over the last few months.
[302:54.22]All I can say is thank you.
[302:55.52]I'm happy that you like being here.
[302:57.14]Happy that you think it's fun to be around.
[303:01.99]The Great Canadian.
[303:04.07]Coming in again.
[303:08.19]And then we had another one from Codeman.
[303:10.73]$10 from Codeman.
[303:13.42]They say, I just want to say thanks for all the entertainment you give us all.
[303:15.49]You're one of the best streamers on the platform.
[303:17.19]No joke.
[303:22.81]I'm honored and happy that you think that.
[303:27.90]I try to put forth the best streams I can and, you know, sometimes you swing and miss, sometimes you swing and get a base hit.
[303:39.17]I'm just gonna keep trying to have fun.
[303:41.13]You know, I just like having fun, and it's awesome to have a bunch of people that also think the same things are fun and funny.
[303:48.33]It's pretty awesome, actually.
[303:52.19]This one was a miss.
[303:55.94]Wait, no, what?
[303:58.18]That was one of the most intense livestreams I've done in, like, probably six months.
[304:03.86]I almost... I almost passed out on stream today.
[304:06.46]That was intensity.
[304:16.14]Kappa means sarcasm.
[304:17.68]Oh, I'm sorry.
[304:18.31]I just installed BTTV.
[304:19.57]I didn't understand.
[304:21.35]And then right at the end, clue the sniper.
[304:22.51]Thanks for 250.
[304:27.39]Thank you, guys.
[304:31.31]A little bit on the shorter scale today.
[304:34.49]Just under five hours.
[304:35.45]I cannot lie to you guys, though.
[304:37.97]After that horror game, and after the first... No, after the second training session in Creed, I didn't think I was going to make it.
[304:48.46]I love how I took one sip of Coke and somebody's just like, what the fuck are you doing?
[304:52.67]That's not going to do anything.
[304:54.79]And I'm just like, oh, wait a minute.
[304:57.25]They're actually right.
[304:59.67]You looked really stressed.
[305:03.65]Yeah, I actually cannot stream tomorrow.
[305:05.47]I have an obligation I have to take care of.
[305:07.17]And we're going to come back.
[305:12.27]I'll probably do two or three days in a row.
[305:15.19]Saturday is me and Star are gonna play VR.
[305:18.50]We're gonna do Rec Room.
[305:19.58]We're just gonna have some fun.
[305:24.74]Maybe a couple other co-op games.
[305:29.49]Should be just a chill time.
[305:35.49]You should play Onward together.
[305:36.53]Yeah, we've been looking at VR titles that have multiplayer.
[305:48.19]But yeah, nothing tomorrow.
[305:49.09]I've got an obligation I have to take care of.
[305:50.87]I've had quite a few of those the last few days, unfortunately.
[305:55.53]But, that's life, you know?
[305:57.99]Hope you had a good time tonight.
[305:59.09]I had a blast.
[305:59.95]I was a little exhausted, but... My inner tuber shot out today.
[306:09.87]Have a great rest of your night.
[306:11.93]I will see you guys... Who's streaming right now?
[306:14.92]Who's streaming right now?
[306:19.57]Anybody?
[306:19.89]Why can I not load any channels?
[306:25.90]Uh, what's my, like, following?
[306:33.84]A webpage is slowing down your browser.
[306:35.86]Would you like us to stop it?
[306:38.20]What the fuck?
[306:41.21]Uh, am I still live?
[306:42.05]This is odd.

[307:38.41]Let's raid Vinny.
[307:40.87]It's been a while since we raided Vinny.
[307:43.61]We raided Nova a couple weeks back and then Joel before that.
[307:47.45]Let's go raid Vinny.
[307:49.99]He's playing Kid Icarus Uprising right now.
[307:53.58]Interestingly enough.

[308:07.85]And let's open it up.
