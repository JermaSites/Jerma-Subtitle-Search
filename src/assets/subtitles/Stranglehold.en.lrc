[00:06.95]Okay.
[00:08.45]I'm back.
[00:09.07]I'm ready.
[00:14.89]There it is.
[00:17.37]John Woo presents Stranglehold.
[00:24.82]Midway.
[00:25.88]Good old Midway.
[00:26.94]What a great company.
[00:33.40]A John Woo game.
[00:36.56]Inspector Tequila.
[00:47.31]What a good... What a good company.
[00:50.41]Looking forward to it.
[00:54.79]There he is.
[00:55.93]No.
[00:56.39]Those are four bad guys.
[01:00.63]Hong Kong.
[01:01.27]Is there... Alright, I thought that was like a... Never mind.
[01:12.13]Which one?
[01:12.71]Where am I?
[01:24.10]Hey.
[01:26.30]What the fuck?
[01:30.24]Get me in there.
[01:35.42]No, no, no, no, no, don't do it.
[01:36.76]No, no, no, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[01:41.88]James Bond walks right in the middle.
[01:51.34]Use to kill... Okay.
[01:54.85]Don't know what that tried to tell me.
[02:00.13]Okay, that was awesome.
[02:03.29]That was fucking awesome.
[02:04.79]Unlock the shop.
[02:07.80]Settings.
[02:10.12]Oh man, this is going to be good.
[02:11.80]This is going to be good.
[02:17.14]This is going to be good.
[02:19.16]You guys understand that, right?
[02:21.40]That's fine.
[02:29.11]Let's get right into it.
[02:30.03]New game.
[02:31.23]What did I just do?
[02:31.97]I tried to hit... Credits, trailer...
[02:48.08]Are you fucking serious?
[02:53.34]Why is there a wheel man drone?
[03:05.15]Another classic.
[03:10.49]It's all connected.
[03:16.39]I'm so happy that Wheelman is in here.
[03:20.72]Play that game?
[03:21.42]Already did last week.
[03:25.66]Wait, did I buy this one?
[03:32.20]Alright, whatever.
[03:33.78]New game, normal.
[03:36.55]Let's go, John Woo.
[03:39.83]Coming soon.
[03:41.29]Try to take advantage of height on your enemies.
[03:43.19]Look for ways to get above them using interactions.
[03:45.85]Thanks for the tip.
[03:53.47]You quit Wheelman in 40 minutes.
[03:55.35]Play it more.
[03:57.43]That game was unbearable.
[03:59.78]Actually, you know what?
[04:00.46]That was better than Neverdead.
[04:01.54]I will tell you that.
[04:03.22]What's the first game we played tonight?
[04:12.45]Okay.
[04:12.61]What?
[04:12.85]I thought the whole... You're not.
[04:14.85]My name is Tequila.
[04:35.80]You stand in the SWAT, the lead dies or disappears.
[04:38.88]One guy would be crazy to go in there.
[04:40.70]You used to be that crazy guy, Jeremy.
[04:42.98]What happened?
[04:43.74]This is Jeremy.
[04:44.36]If I was that missing cop, I hope one of us would want to go.
[04:47.68]Don't send anywhere, Captain.
[04:49.32]They just get in my way.
[04:51.24]Tequila, don't.
[04:52.34]It's a setup.
[04:52.80]Tequila, don't do it.
[04:53.54]I hope so.
[04:54.40]I hate to think they were wasting our time.
[04:56.44]Tequila, get back here.
[04:58.52]No, I'm a fucking rebel, man.
[04:59.84]I make my own rules.
[05:00.66]I drive my own car.
[05:02.00]I got my own badge.
[05:03.22]I got my own apartment.
[05:04.28]I got my own house.
[05:10.86]I almost got hit by that car.
[05:13.90]I don't give a fuck, holy shit.
[05:23.39]Uh.
[05:25.89]Okay.
[05:27.54]Careful Tequila, this is a rough neighborhood.
[05:29.76]Press L1 to dive and R1 to shoot.
[05:33.04]Tequila time, slow motion, will engage automatically when you aim at enemies while driving.
[05:39.39]Aye aye aye.
[05:41.59]Oh come on, really?
[05:46.17]Oh my god, I love it already.
[05:47.52]I'm just like a fucking flying fish.
[05:55.42]Okay, cool.
[05:58.51]It's just fucking Max Payne.
[06:01.75]Tequila will slide over objects when you run into them.
[06:06.42]It's just Mac's face.
[06:13.41]Environment exploits.
[06:17.07]Rush it!
[06:18.37]Oh my god, that guy turned into the fucking brown beef.
[06:32.87]I love it.
[06:33.41]It's fun.
[06:34.07]It's already fun.
[06:35.12]It feels fun.
[06:37.02]Pick up a health pack.
[06:37.72]Where's the health pack?
[06:44.42]Alright.
[06:45.06]I gotta ask.
[06:47.08]What was it about video games?
[06:50.63]What is it about video games?
[06:52.51]Where apparently if you jump forward or if you dive backwards you're better at aiming a gun.
[07:02.76]Don't you think it would make more sense if instead of a dive, it was a hold it correctly up and holding your eye over to see?
[07:12.31]What's with this thing about diving makes you better at accuracy?
[07:16.01]That's the complete fucking opposite.
[07:17.59]And like 30 games did that shit.
[07:22.04]It should be like...
[07:31.75]Why am I questioning this?
[07:32.83]I don't know.
[07:33.19]I don't know why I'm questioning it.
[07:37.35]Because it's fun.
[07:38.89]You know, you're right.
[07:39.57]It is fun.
[07:42.76]Diving is fun.
[07:44.98]You know, we're going to do a no dive.
[07:46.58]Look at this flip phone.
[07:48.76]That ain't how it's like.
[07:49.58]To access mission information in time from your handset, press the select button.
[07:54.51]Investigate the market.
[07:55.59]Search for the golden rabbit sign.
[07:59.59]Search for the golden rabbit.
[08:01.99]Okay, sure.
[08:03.92]When something is highlighted, press L1 to interact with the object.
[08:06.78]Tequila time will engage automatically when you aim at enemies while interacting.
[08:13.22]Interact with highlighted objects.
[08:15.50]I gotta, really?
[08:16.38]Oh my god.
[08:20.95]Stylish kills award you stars.
[08:23.45]The more stylish the kill, the more stars you get.
[08:25.53]Try to get your style combo as high as possible by doing stylish kills.
[08:32.37]Let's do like a toe kill on that guy.
[08:38.95]Wait, is this supposed to be happening?
[08:48.92]I don't think, is that supposed to happen?
[08:51.12]I don't, I'm not sure.
[08:52.36]I don't know what the fuck that was.
[08:53.66]Alright, L2 is cover.
[09:09.19]This game is fucking fun.
[09:10.83]What a fun game.
[09:11.85]John Woo did a great job.
[09:12.97]Let's grind up the elevator.
[09:14.69]No, I want to go up.
[09:18.41]Highlight it.
[09:18.91]Go up.
[09:19.97]No, I can't go up.
[09:23.16]I can run up this.
[09:24.68]What a gymnast.
[09:32.72]Nobody can do this.
[09:33.64]I don't care who you are.
[09:34.34]I don't care if you're John Woo.
[09:35.68]I don't care if you're Tequila.
[09:40.68]How do I heal?
[09:42.18]I think I have unlimited healing.
[09:44.56]That was a lot of good bananas I just destroyed for no reason.
[09:51.51]Perform stylish skill to earn stars to fill the tequila bomb gauge.
[09:56.45]Okay, press the left button to convert tequila bomb energy directly into health.
[10:01.67]Right.
[10:01.89]Okay.
[10:05.35]Right.
[10:08.53]That's fine.
[10:09.51]Let's go.
[10:11.03]Roasted pigs.
[10:13.19]Fine to collect paper cranes to refill the tequila bomb gauge.
[10:16.47]Listen carefully, you can hear a paper crane if it's hidden nearby.
[10:22.71]Something else that's worth noting.
[10:24.23]There is no jump in this game.
[10:25.57]There is only dive.
[10:27.31]That's it.
[10:30.76]X doesn't jump.
[10:31.44]There's no jump.
[10:32.10]You just L1 to dive.
[10:35.91]It's pretty crazy that John Woo made this entire game by himself in his basement over the course of 16 years.
[10:47.66]You don't need to jump if you can dive, that's true.
[11:08.29]What's happening?
[11:20.08]I need some dialogue here.
[11:21.66]Where's the dialogue?
[11:23.75]He should be narrating this.
[11:32.25]Who is that?
[11:39.62]Those are just like cooking scissors.
[11:43.24]Oh no.
[11:45.03]Oh wait, that's the police officer's bag.
[11:46.95]Oh boy.
[11:47.83]Next.
[11:48.53]Next?
[11:48.75]Should we go next?
[11:49.23]What do you think?
[11:50.99]They're asking you guys that question.
[11:54.41]The game is subliminally asking you if you want to go next.
[12:03.48]Oh shit.
[12:04.08]Watermelon blood.
[12:17.57]Alright, no diving.
[12:19.17]I'm not gonna use it.
[12:20.51]I refuse to use their game mechanic.
[12:21.77]I'm not gonna do it.
[12:30.69]Okay, fine.
[12:31.97]Fine.
[12:33.29]I'll get on the fucking, like, dinner cart.
[12:36.53]This shit is so dumb.
[12:41.20]This is so dumb.
[12:41.94]Is that a propane tank?
[12:49.88]It was.
[13:00.31]Get him!
[13:04.03]Oh shit!
[13:10.38]I fucking love it, man.
[13:11.48]It's so perfect.
[13:13.26]I need another dinner card.
[13:16.18]Give me a dinner card, come on!
[13:21.72]So I'm just tapping L1.
[13:23.00]Let's get back on the dinner cart.
[13:32.58]There we go.
[13:34.30]No, I don't over it.
[13:35.42]God damn it, come on.
[13:37.68]Alright, get on it.
[13:41.31]Get on the cart.
[13:42.51]There it is.
[13:46.75]Why does it want me to do this?
[13:48.13]That's like dangerous.
[13:48.77]That's gonna get me killed.
[13:55.95]By the way, 110 bullets is a lot of bullets.
[14:01.40]And I have infinite ammo.
[14:03.16]There's no reloading.
[14:06.16]These guys are just magic guns.
[14:22.08]How many more of these guys do I have to kill before I can be out of here?
[14:24.14]Alright, I'm done, right?
[14:26.18]Oh, god, no.
[14:29.93]I wanna move on.
[14:30.65]I don't wanna keep doing it.
[14:32.69]Come on, John.
[14:37.75]They're, like, introducing this gimmick and really making it overstay its welcome very quickly.
[14:51.53]What the fuck did I just do to that guy?
[15:09.73]Switch weapons, alright.
[15:10.49]I have a shotgun now.
[15:12.77]If I'm interested.
[15:13.45]So you don't have to die for the shotgun, it's not necessary.
[15:24.21]It's always necessary.
[15:24.97]What am I talking about?
[15:25.89]It's very necessary, every time.
[15:27.37]I didn't shoot that guy once, by the way.
[15:32.63]Not one time.
[15:35.95]Somebody else is diving around.
[15:39.71]How come when he shoots this, it doesn't explode?
[15:43.95]Shouldn't this be exploding?
[15:53.45]Fuck.
[15:53.99]Don't do the whole thing again.
[15:55.33]Please don't do the whole mission again.
[15:56.57]Please.
[15:57.91]That was a mistake.
[15:58.83]Please don't do that again.
[15:59.59]I don't... Oh, God.
[16:02.70]Fuck me.
[16:03.28]What am I thinking?
[16:04.46]What am I doing?
[16:05.24]Why would I do that?
[16:08.26]Oh, my God.
[16:09.22]I have to do the whole thing again.
[16:10.36]What a mistake.
[16:16.40]Why would I do that?
[16:17.30]I can't believe it.
[16:20.88]That's a better strategy.
[16:21.75]It really is.
[16:31.29]Don't do that again.
[16:33.02]Just fucking walk up and whack them.
[16:38.54]It kills them faster.
[16:40.58]We can be done with this so much cleaner.
[16:51.32]More stylish kills, come on.
[17:05.59]Alright, this is going to sound really strange right now.
[17:07.89]Some of you guys might just be like, what are you talking about?
[17:11.65]I mean, for a second here, for like one second, I'm not going to lie, I'm not kidding.
[17:17.64]I like forgot I was streaming, and I was like in a dream.
[17:25.50]For one second, I was just like, this is a pretty good dream I'm having.
[17:32.09]Don't ask me what's going on, man.
[17:41.24]I was just like, oh wow, I forgot I was even in this stream.
[17:44.56]And I was like, oh wow, what a weird dream.
[17:46.16]This is a weird dream, isn't it?
[17:49.37]I gotta wake up.
[17:53.59]How do I wake up?
[18:00.53]I don't know.
[18:03.01]It's kind of hard to die in this game.
[18:08.04]Alright, we're good.
[18:09.22]You were never a screamer.
[18:14.02]Alright, let's go.
[18:16.30]I think that's derealization.
[18:18.64]Alright, we made it out of there.
[18:22.05]We're fine.
[18:22.55]Now our... Everything's gonna be okay.
[18:24.25]We're just gonna get inside of a... There's a lot of...
[18:34.66]New mechanic, here it comes.
[18:37.30]Die, die, die from Reaper.
[18:41.60]You're in a standoff.
[18:42.52]You have to take out the enemies one at a time by aiming with the right stick and shooting with R1.
[18:48.49]Dodge their shots with the left stick.
[18:51.95]Keep an eye out for glints.
[18:57.03]Am I not dodging right?
[18:59.96]That guy exploded!
[19:01.46]Wait, why did that guy just explode?
[19:02.85]I just got shot in the fucking head three times.
[19:05.49]Why did that guy explode?
[19:06.51]Oh shit, we're out of that boat.
[19:25.62]Don't...
[19:28.32]It's not gonna happen, right?
[19:29.92]Okay, thank God.
[19:32.83]What?
[19:34.65]What's going on?
[19:37.91]Am I missing something?
[19:44.87]I think I'm missing something.
[19:47.34]Wait, we're not... No, I have the shotgun.
[19:53.78]We're not back at the beginning of that level, right?
[20:04.48]Golden pistol.
[20:09.40]Interact with highlighted objects.
[20:12.67]What highlighted object am I going to interact with?
[20:14.31]What are you talking about?
[20:15.05]What?
[20:17.07]This?
[20:18.81]Oh.
[20:20.47]Oh, that.
[20:20.94]Okay.
[20:24.28]How many banana merchants live in this district?
[20:28.26]You know, that is a really good question.
[20:32.84]No shortage of bananas.
[20:46.37]That's gonna block it?
[20:47.29]That little rail blocks every shotgun blast?
[20:56.49]R2 is manually going into tequila time.
[20:58.99]Okay.
[21:16.15]I love this game already.
[21:18.03]This is a great game.
[21:19.37]I like this game.
[21:21.17]John Woo, if you're watching the stream right now.
[21:24.41]You did a pro- You did a pro- What?
[21:31.75]So we unlocked Sniper Elite mode.
[21:36.46]P-Form?
[21:37.46]P-Form!
[21:39.28]P-Form!
[21:40.98]Get it together!
[21:41.82]Holy goodness!
[21:43.89]Perform stylish kills to earn stars to fill the tequila bomb gauge.
[21:47.41]When you do this, the precision aim icon will be highlighted.
[21:51.68]Press the up button to enter or exit precision aim.
[22:13.06]I didn't... Why did that happen to that guy?
[22:15.10]Oh, shit.
[22:22.07]He's trying to knock the barrels down.
[22:23.55]Alright, here comes the joke.
[22:25.50]Ready for the fucking laugh out loud joke?
[22:34.42]It actually worked.
[22:36.96]It actually worked and he's still in pain.
[22:40.22]I'm surprised.
[22:42.88]That's pretty insane.
[22:44.50]Okay.
[22:44.92]Well, that's funny.
[22:46.20]Funny.
[22:50.75]Is he dead?
[22:55.17]Well, he is now.
[22:59.07]Come on, dude.
[22:59.63]You don't shoot a guy in the dick.
[23:01.49]What am I doing?
[23:06.53]That would hurt a lot.
[23:07.43]That would be very painful.
[23:09.33]I have access to it again.
[23:16.21]Come on, dude.
[23:16.87]Where's your respect?
[23:17.93]You don't shoot a guy in the dick.
[23:20.83]What's wrong with you?
[23:22.01]New gun?
[23:50.95]Get out of here.
[23:52.91]That was so fucking awful.
[23:55.81]That was so mean.
[24:00.92]Keep moving.
[24:01.52]Let's go.
[24:04.32]Die.
[24:05.12]Fuck.
[24:08.66]Why is it not healing anything?
[24:09.76]I'm feeling pretty claustrophobic in here, by the way.
[24:19.17]Uh-oh.
[24:20.25]Standoff.
[24:21.43]You know what this means.
[24:22.07]Is that Robin Ackendowns?
[24:25.87]Was that Robin Ackendowns again?
[24:27.53]Oh, a glint behind us.
[25:04.70]I'm sorry.
[25:06.60]I'm sorry.
[25:07.12]I'm sorry, guys.
[25:08.34]That was not... It's okay.
[25:12.55]It's gonna be alright.
[25:13.15]Don't worry.
[25:14.83]Let's do it again.
[25:17.39]The ballerina.
[25:24.52]Here we go.
[25:26.96]Count to five.
[25:28.55]It's gonna be over, promise.
[25:29.87]Ready?
[25:31.29]Start counting.
[25:33.29]Count to five.
[25:34.63]Get it in five seconds.
[25:37.57]One.
[25:38.65]Two.
[25:39.79]Three.
[25:40.97]Four.
[25:42.09]Five.
[25:42.86]Six.
[25:43.34]Seven.
[25:58.52]I got nervous.
[26:02.92]One goon, two goons, three goons.
[26:06.00]There's a 20 second cooldown on Dammit.
[26:11.71]Now, I'll get it.
[26:12.37]Ready?
[26:13.41]I'm not gonna miss one shot.
[26:15.37]I fucking promise.
[26:16.93]Otherwise, if I miss one shot, I will delete my Twitch account.
[26:43.83]Woo!
[26:44.95]Don't need to delete my Twitch account.
[26:49.37]Can't wait.
[27:01.88]Twitch account saved, that's true.
[27:03.60]Yeah, we saved it, we're fine.
[27:05.14]Hello?
[27:05.38]I missed, I didn't miss.
[27:13.58]Which is why I want you to wait until I can send backup.
[27:18.10]Sorry, Captain.
[27:19.00]I just got a personal invitation.
[27:20.62]Tequila!
[27:24.24]Tequila.
[27:25.20]Okay, I don't know if I killed him or if the telephone pole did.
[27:35.48]I'm not sure.
[27:36.48]I have no idea.
[27:38.78]Oh, I fell off that.
[27:40.02]That was great.
[27:42.39]That won't even matter.
[27:45.25]If I miss this, I'll delete my Twitch account.
[27:48.99]I gotta stop saying that.
[27:55.47]Why am I shooting a shotgun from this far away?
[28:01.83]Okay, good.
[28:03.11]That worked.
[28:04.25]We have an explosive right here.
[28:08.48]I didn't... I didn't even do anything.
[28:10.22]Just shoot right here.
[28:11.26]Bang.
[28:11.60]Gonna get all three of them.
[28:15.48]I got a couple.
[28:25.31]You're the only one left?
[28:26.03]Just keep moving.
[28:30.52]We have to get to the car before we stop playing this game, right?
[28:35.98]I'm not going to stop playing until I get to the car.
[28:43.38]Easy.
[28:43.60]Alright.
[28:46.29]Checkpoint.
[28:47.99]Now what?
[28:54.39]I'm actually fairly surprised that that worked.
[29:06.07]Damn it.
[29:09.06]I have to kill every single person with a dickshot or I have to delete my Twitch account.
[29:12.48]No.
[29:13.04]That's not going to happen.
[29:24.63]Okay, cutscene.
[29:28.11]Is it melee in this game?
[29:31.22]I actually have no idea.
[29:37.13]I'm sure we'll find out.
[29:50.44]Hey, tequila for me?
[29:53.30]Thanks, man.
[29:53.78]That's a full glass of tequila.
[29:59.73]Why would you do that?
[30:00.33]What are you doing?
[30:03.57]Just, like, spilled a bunch of tequila for no reason.
[30:05.41]That was probably expensive stuff.
[30:09.43]Okay.
[30:09.97]Well, whatever.
[30:10.37]That's a fizzy... Tequila won't even do that, by the way.
[30:12.59]It's not like seltzer water.
[30:14.19]There's no carbonation in tequila.
[30:16.01]It's not gonna do that.
[30:16.95]That guy gave me seltzer water and told me it was tequila.
[30:19.16]What a fucking ripoff.
[30:45.77]Oh, God.
[30:46.81]You got the passports?
[30:48.63]Drugs.
[30:51.11]Too light.
[30:52.07]You're short.
[30:53.16]Wong agreed to the amount.
[30:55.10]Now, do you have the passports or not?
[30:58.16]I don't give a damn what Wong agreed to.
[31:00.94]This is an I-9 deal.
[31:03.46]What?
[31:06.64]I don't know what that means.
[31:09.64]Be cool.
[31:10.76]We got heat at the bar.
[31:12.56]You brought a cop to our deal?
[31:15.65]Hey, wait, what?
[31:17.09]Wow!
[31:17.97]Hey, holy... Wow, easy, this is... Why would you do that?
[31:23.21]That fast?
[31:29.24]I'm a little lost on this one.
[31:38.20]Wait, did I get him?
[31:45.20]I gotta get every dick shot or delete my Twitch account.
[31:47.40]I'll do it.
[31:47.80]Fine.
[31:48.89]Every death has to be a dick shot.
[31:50.19]Alright, we'll delete Twitch account.
[32:14.99]Oh, shit!
[32:15.85]No, that was a ball.
[32:16.51]That was a ball.
[32:17.45]He's got low-hanging balls.
[32:22.38]He's got low-hanging balls.
[32:25.02]You know, I have low-hanging balls, so I can tell you that's real.
[32:40.98]Hey, hey, hey.
[32:42.70]Hey, hey, wait a minute.
[32:43.53]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[32:44.35]Just back up a little.
[32:45.31]Back up just a little bit.
[32:55.52]Oh, man.
[33:05.80]Dickshot for setback.
[33:06.80]Alright, can I take, can I get everybody in here with a dickshot?
[33:10.76]I'm gonna try.
[33:11.46]I'm gonna try my damnedest, I promise.
[33:15.60]Can I change guns?
[33:18.50]Jesus Christ, hold on, just wait!
[33:25.81]No, shit!
[33:34.33]This is so childish.
[33:36.09]Nothing about this is mature at all.
[33:38.41]What an immature fucking stream this has turned out to be.
[33:41.19]You know how old I am?
[33:45.75]I'm fucking old.
[33:47.41]I shouldn't be doing this.
[33:48.39]This is fucking, like, this is childish.
[33:50.43]I want to change weapons.
[33:52.06]There it is.
[33:53.38]Okay.
[34:04.64]Wow, that guy really didn't want to get shot in the dick.
[34:06.78]You know, I understand.
[34:08.30]I can feel that.
[34:14.22]Okay, we're doing good.

[37:18.16]A guy comes behind the sandwich.
[37:19.46]I remember.
[37:21.32]Easy.
[37:27.33]Got him.
[37:30.95]Easy.
[37:34.47]Good.
[37:36.67]I got over it.
[37:39.21]I'm fine.
[37:42.64]Who's left?
[37:49.34]One guy?
[37:49.78]Hey, there's been a hell pack here this whole time.
[37:52.56]I could have been fine.
[37:56.00]What?
[37:56.20]I can't... Let me get out of here.
[37:58.69]Should I just leave?
[37:59.59]Where did I go?
[38:01.19]What?
[38:25.22]Am I stuck here forever?
[38:25.98]I need to leave this building.
[38:32.49]Get me out of here.
[38:33.23]I'm stuck here forever.
[38:34.14]I can't leave.
[38:34.76]Forever.
[38:52.08]Dickshot purgatory.
[38:53.34]That's where we are.
[38:54.74]I can't get out.
[38:57.34]There has to be like an exit, right?
[38:58.78]Like to the kitchen?
[39:03.04]What am I supposed to do?
[39:04.22]How do I get out of this?
[39:11.98]Is that guy running from me?
[39:13.14]I don't know.
[39:13.57]I can't tell.
[39:17.07]This is never ending enemies.
[39:18.15]I need to escape.
[39:19.55]What the fuck?
[39:36.37]Get me out of here.
[39:37.71]Get me out.
[39:38.29]I just need to find the exit.
[39:39.89]It's upstairs.
[39:40.51]It has to be.
[39:44.87]I don't think I need... I think I need to kill everybody.
[39:49.23]I don't think there is an exit.
[39:52.19]There's no exit.
[39:55.05]We're just gonna stay here.
[39:58.55]We're just gonna stay here.
[40:02.47]This is okay with me.
[40:03.91]I think I found the secret.
[40:07.03]I found the secret.
[40:07.78]This is how you do it.
[40:10.82]This is the way to do it.
[40:11.68]I win.
[40:12.00]We're good.
[40:18.72]Won't be long now.
[40:20.08]Just cover the stairs like it's a fucking survival game.
[40:24.55]God, zombie.
[40:41.36]Oh, no.
[40:42.00]They're coming from another area.
[40:44.14]What do I do?
[40:45.90]I'll tell you what we do.
[40:50.31]We go right for the dick.
[40:57.75]Hey, hey!
[40:59.67]Wait a minute.
[41:02.28]I'm in a dream again.
[41:09.42]Activate it!
[41:09.98]Activate it!
[41:10.46]Why are there guns everywhere?
[41:20.28]Look at the amount of pistols.
[41:21.36]I feel like I'm playing Stalker again.
[41:30.84]You were the easiest person.
[41:32.94]You're not dead?
[41:39.19]Don't stand still!
[41:41.11]What the fuck?!
[41:54.88]I just got Luigi'd.
[41:57.38]I just got Luigi'd.
[41:58.30]I'm playing like the Nintendo Switch right now.
[42:02.80]I'm playing New Super Mario Bros.
[42:04.38]Wii U. Is the game too hard for you?
[42:06.55]Should we turn it down for you, sweetheart?
[42:13.78]How do I get out of this?
[42:14.60]What the fuck?
[42:18.89]Why did I do this?
[42:21.25]Wait, hold on, this is important, hold on.
[42:28.17]I wanted you to... I can't do it from here?
[42:30.68]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[42:32.74]There we go.
[42:33.30]I did it, time to get out.
[42:35.96]That's not how you get out.
[42:43.90]Oh my god.
[42:47.33]Okay.
[42:53.21]I got him in the back.
[42:55.39]Whoops.
[42:59.36]Alright, can I ask a serious question?
[43:04.04]Do I just need to survive?
[43:06.46]Or do I need to leave this place?
[43:08.10]Is there an exit?
[43:11.52]Have I lost my mind?
[43:14.44]I may have lost my mind completely.
[43:20.80]I gotta be stylish.
[43:30.02]Stylish.
[43:30.42]Nice and stylish, here we go.
[43:46.07]Get out of here.
[43:49.01]I don't understand.
[43:53.05]This is just a survival mission.
[43:54.43]I don't have to escape.
[43:55.21]Okay, well that's good to know.
[43:57.81]I'm gonna haul my... Ooh, nice.
[44:03.03]Right in the leg.
[44:09.63]Got it.
[44:12.60]Who's left?
[44:15.83]Got him.
[44:17.36]Perfect.
[44:20.20]That's what I wanted to happen.
[44:29.58]Fucking goomba stomped that guy.
[44:33.94]We're not playing on the easy difficulty.
[44:37.70]We're playing on hard.
[44:46.15]I killed that guy too.
[44:48.15]Slid into him.
[44:48.69]That's what you gotta do.
[44:53.66]No, don't go in the heart, please.
[45:00.64]Jesus Christ!
[45:02.90]Oh my God!
[45:06.46]What am I doing?
[45:07.24]Give me the health pack.
[45:09.38]Give me the health pack.
[45:11.12]Give me the health pack.
[45:12.78]Where is it?
[45:13.70]It's up here somewhere.
[45:17.66]There it is.
[45:23.66]That was a stunt fault.
[45:29.57]I ain't losing right now.
[45:30.41]I keep losing this guy.
[45:38.68]Where did he go?
[45:43.01]Where did he go?
[45:44.13]Oh my goodness, he's hiding behind the burn.
[45:47.99]You know what?
[45:49.87]Never mind, we're good, I did it.
[45:53.49]What the fuck, this guy's got a flamethrower.
[45:58.96]Oh shit.
[45:59.72]Alright, there's a health pack right here.
[46:05.36]Stop sliding on the table.
[46:07.14]Oh my god, he's got a fucking grenade launcher.
[46:15.18]Get away from the grenade launcher, please.
[46:19.55]Oh my god, he's shooting point blank fucking rockets.
[46:23.58]Why is he shooting point blank rockets?
[46:45.09]I had full health.
[46:45.85]What happened?
[46:51.40]His melee is an instant kill.
[46:56.04]Weakness.
[47:02.85]It is his weakness.
[47:03.59]It actually is the weakness.
[47:04.53]Look at his health.
[47:15.31]Nice!
[47:17.09]Don't shoot it that quick!
[47:21.39]Got it!
[47:22.03]He's dead!
[47:23.19]I win.
[47:31.85]Sometimes you just have to figure out what the boss's weakness is and exploit it.
[47:35.49]That's what I did.
[47:36.87]This is what our NEET wanted us to find.
[47:39.70]Bullet between the eyes.
[47:41.46]That's a signature hit.
[47:43.22]The iron eyes are the Dragon Claw's muscle.
[47:46.26]Wong's got the ionized healing cups and dealing passports when he came.
[47:48.84]Pretty much weapon swap.
[47:49.76]I agree.
[47:50.06]Except the deal went bad.
[47:52.06]Someone's trying to start a war.
[47:54.65]We better stop him.
[47:55.71]I'm heading down to Taio.
[47:57.33]I'm gonna shake some cages and see what falls out.
[47:59.67]Like hell you will.
[48:00.89]Taio's not your turf and you know it.
[48:02.65]That's an ongoing narcotics probe.
[48:04.79]We have it under control.
[48:06.43]Next.
[48:08.31]What?
[48:09.61]And you call that under control?
[48:11.00]You guys aren't actually saying next, are you?
[48:12.56]You go out of bounds, you'll lose your badge.
[48:15.60]No.
[48:17.00]Forget about the next.
[48:17.68]147 enemies.
[48:23.10]21 style.
[48:23.24]7 million dollars.
[48:23.72]Damage to the world.
[48:24.80]D+.
[48:24.86]Okay.
[48:25.04]Thanks.
[48:44.20]Why is it damage to the world?
[48:48.08]It's keeping track of how much damage I've done to the... I don't understand.
[48:53.21]Let's find them.
[48:55.85]Would it be damage to the city?
[48:57.75]Or town?
[48:58.73]Or like province?
[49:00.72]The world!
[49:01.30]The world!
[49:12.05]He's going for a dick shot.
[49:13.13]He was just going for a dick shot.
[49:14.05]Dick shot.
[49:15.39]Yep.
[49:15.59]We both can fucking play that game, buddy.
[49:43.46]Okay.
[49:47.32]Assault rifle?
[49:47.94]Ooh, there's an assault rifle now.
[49:53.86]Shotgun?
[49:54.26]No, I want this.
[49:54.91]Just keep moving.
[50:03.01]We're gonna go fast.
[50:03.79]We're gonna move very fast in this one.
[50:08.80]Get down.
[50:09.46]What are you doing?
[50:10.86]What are you doing?
[50:16.25]Speed run time.
[50:19.22]Keep your eyes on this.
[50:20.52]If you can.
[50:23.51]If you can fucking keep up.
[50:24.77]Try.
[50:25.21]Try to keep up, guys.
[50:54.31]you can keep up.
[51:08.30]Alright, where'd I go?
[51:16.24]Up here?
[51:16.62]I think I instantly died.
[51:27.47]Can you open the door?
[51:28.21]Alright, keep going.
[51:40.68]This is where I gotta go, I understand, I get it.
[51:43.26]I gotta... Checkpoint.
[51:52.45]I just...
[51:57.51]Okay, fine.
[52:03.70]Destroy all the drug tables.
[52:06.74]Sure.
[52:09.66]There's nine of them.
[52:11.33]They're near the black smoke.
[52:14.79]I see black smoke.
[52:22.23]Black smoke you say, huh?
[52:29.70]Next?
[52:30.08]No, not next.
[52:30.74]We have to get in a car first.
[52:33.07]Once we get in a car, I promise we will next.
[52:37.13]We gotta get in that car first.
[52:44.29]That guy died.
[52:45.38]That guy died very, very, very much so.
[52:49.64]Drug table.
[52:52.16]That's one out of nine.
[52:53.62]Any more here, I'll be very disappointed if I miss these.
[53:00.65]No, doesn't look like it.
[53:05.91]There's no car in the game?
[53:06.95]Why'd it say you can lean out of a car?
[53:15.48]Wait, wait, wait.
[53:16.10]That's a tool shed.
[53:17.74]I know what I can do.
[53:20.70]I can slide on it.
[53:23.07]More drops, more drops!
[53:28.65]I'm sorry, I missed the table, did I really?
[53:35.98]Where?
[53:48.78]Shoot the yellow wood pieces on poles to get onto the roofs.
[53:52.84]Roofs.
[53:55.28]Where did I miss one?
[53:55.86]What?
[53:56.20]Oh, there's one in here.
[53:57.32]Fuck.
[53:57.92]There's like a meth lab in here.
[54:05.73]Where is it?
[54:09.85]Get in there.
[54:12.99]Where is it?
[54:13.63]Ah, they're everywhere.
[54:17.66]Are they on the roofs?
[54:18.50]Are they on the roofs?
[54:29.64]Be careful, they're up on the roofs.
[54:43.24]Alright, if you guys... When we eventually next, we're going to be ending it on a very particular game.
[54:47.92]I'm not sure you guys are going to like it.
[54:51.00]We're going to stay with John Woo for at least another 5 to 20, 30 to 40 hours.
[55:06.65]Now, those guys got exploded.
[55:07.77]That's an easy way to do it.
[55:08.73]Nice dodge.
[55:09.45]Too bad you're dead.
[55:11.79]Nice improvement.
[55:13.19]No, we're not going to end on demon souls.
[55:16.61]No way.
[55:17.14]We'll do that another time.
[55:18.86]Not today.
[55:24.18]How did I miss all that shit?
[55:31.86]No bullets?
[55:32.36]What?
[55:39.39]Okay.
[55:40.19]Where?
[55:40.65]I gotta destroy these labs.
[55:42.85]I'm not paying any attention to them.
[55:45.27]Pay more attention to this one.
[55:50.23]One in there.
[55:53.69]Go in there.
[55:56.13]Go.
[55:57.07]Go.
[55:58.89]Go.
[55:59.15]You can jump down there.
[56:00.15]You do so much more dumb shit than that in this game.
[56:03.95]There it is.
[56:04.81]No, don't Tony Hawk.
[56:10.45]Did the music just get compressed?
[56:12.87]Did you guys notice that?
[56:18.18]The music just got compressed to like 28k.
[56:21.94]That's weird.
[56:24.44]You guys hear this too, right?
[56:35.62]Six.
[56:40.36]It's been like this the whole time?
[56:42.10]Has it really?
[56:42.82]Damn.
[56:45.14]Oh, stupid cave, I love it.
[56:48.54]All right, seven.
[56:51.08]I gotta get to that car.
[56:52.00]There's one over here.
[56:52.84]Get down, why?
[56:53.58]Get down!
[57:11.62]I hate how there's no just regular jump.
[57:13.73]I can't just... I'm getting like motion sickness.
[57:21.53]It's too close.
[57:22.31]You're gonna make me fucking puke.
[57:27.50]One more.
[57:27.92]Where's the last one?
[57:37.69]Where is it?
[57:46.72]Anyone with smoke?
[57:50.74]Check the roofs.
[57:51.46]Yeah, I gotta check the roofs.
[57:55.40]And, like, dude, the compressed music is, like, giving me anxiety.
[58:01.60]I swear to God.
[58:03.12]This YouTube compression music video.
[58:09.32]Okay, so you guys know when you go on YouTube and you find a... You find a song... You're like, oh, I really like this song.
[58:17.29]Like, I like this band.
[58:19.23]I'm gonna look up the music.
[58:20.15]I love this particular single.
[58:22.73]And you find the single that you're looking for that happened to have been uploaded in, like, 2007.
[58:28.35]And it's 240p and it sounds like this.
[58:33.27]Why hasn't that person deleted that video?
[58:37.31]Why?
[58:39.86]It's in here.
[58:42.86]Why is that video still up?
[58:47.17]There's no purpose for that video.
[58:49.49]People click it and they immediately click off.
[58:52.09]So why even have it in the first place?
[58:53.87]Just get rid of it.
[58:55.51]That's a case of that person doesn't even know that they made that video.
[59:00.91]That person uploaded that song nine years ago, and that's it.
[59:06.83]They forgot their password, they're just done.
[59:13.94]Yeah, they all have like 30 million views.
[59:17.70]Where the hell am I going now?
[59:23.80]Ayayay.
[59:27.84]Can I jump down?
[59:28.88]Let me jump down.
[59:29.46]Jump down, please.
[59:33.00]Thank God.
[59:33.44]Aim down.
[59:34.28]Where was I going?
[59:54.70]What do I need to do?
[59:55.27]Where am I going?
[60:04.21]It's like back here.
[60:04.76]There's like a gate I had to go through.
[60:06.02]I don't remember where it is.
[60:09.98]I have to pee so bad.
[60:20.40]Even in the face of death.
[60:24.68]You know, you are right.
[60:29.54]Okay.
[60:30.48]We're good?
[60:32.72]Press L when to mount the zipline.
[60:34.26]You can slow down and speed up while on the ziplines by pushing backward, forward, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[60:44.90]Explode.
[60:46.09]Explode.
[60:47.37]There we are.
[60:52.63]I don't like this level.
[60:58.77]Go on the zipline.
[61:00.12]Shoot this thing.
[61:08.46]Oh, come on.
[61:09.06]That guy didn't get killed by all that shit.
[61:12.42]He did walk right into it.
[61:15.81]Alright, we're good.
[61:18.55]Keep going.
[61:18.99]We're not doing very many stylish kills.
[61:26.46]We're almost in the boat.
[61:31.28]Doing that with my bare hand.
[61:33.42]I ended up with a 1000 degree rope burn.
[61:38.27]That's fine.
[61:45.81]Come on, John Woo.
[61:50.01]We're gonna piss my pants.
[61:53.06]Now what?
[62:01.06]What do you want me to do?
[62:05.77]Of course.
[62:06.67]I get you.
[62:07.23]I get it.
[62:07.51]Fine.
[62:12.65]Come on.
[62:17.13]Almost there.
[62:17.55]Playing like Jurassic Park now.
[62:30.03]I win, game over.
[62:35.92]Drop it.
[62:36.32]Pick up the waterfall.
[62:39.02]I don't know what's happening.
[62:42.36]There's a guy with a sniper rifle now.
[62:44.80]Where is he?
[62:47.81]Dicker explosion.
[62:48.53]Dicker dick.
[62:50.01]Every time.
[62:54.80]I think I still have to break this, though.
[62:56.76]Well, that's insult to injury, but I would say so myself.
[63:05.92]Okay, excuse me.
[63:12.47]Funny element.
[63:14.37]I'm not trying to be funny.
[63:22.34]Get me out of Blighttown, for Christ's sake.
[63:28.20]Nobody likes Blighttown.
[63:30.59]Why did you make it here?
[63:32.81]Wait, this came up before Blighttown, right?
[63:34.53]No?
[63:35.37]I don't know. 16...
[63:58.91]I'll be right back.
[63:59.31]I'm going to use the bathroom, and we'll be right back.
