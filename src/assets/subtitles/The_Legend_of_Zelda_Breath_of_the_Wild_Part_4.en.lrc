[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.35]I just want to read something I saw on chat.
[00:05.51]No chat.
[00:06.33]Hold on.
[00:07.22]No chat.
[00:07.56]Jerma doesn't hate streaming.
[00:09.58]He just delays every single stream and talks about retirement every week.
[00:16.45]That's not fair.
[00:18.09]There, no.
[00:19.31]Hold on a second.
[00:21.19]The last, the last like five streams, I have reverse delayed.
[00:25.95]I have, I have started a day or two early.
[00:29.09]The last, besides this one.
[00:31.32]Excuse me.
[00:33.38]There have been at least three or four straight reverse delays as of the last two weeks.
[00:37.04]Hey, just because you didn't see it doesn't mean it didn't happen, right?
[00:41.40]Just because you weren't here doesn't mean I didn't do it.
[00:46.51]So anyways, after today, I'll see you in like 12 days.
[00:51.65]Why do you have to be?
[00:52.67]Why is it?
[00:53.17]No.
[00:59.83]You knew about that October break for a while.
[01:02.89]That's not a delay.
[01:03.73]Well, I just pretend it is.
[01:04.63]That's fine.
[01:13.15]It's my birthday.
[01:14.23]What are you doing?
[01:17.41]I'm crying right now.
[01:21.07]Dude, he hates streaming.
[01:22.57]I love streaming.
[01:23.41]It's like one of my favorite things ever.
[01:35.64]Anyways, welcome to the promised, promised Breath of the Wild Sunday stream.
[01:41.44]I told you I was going to do it and here I am.
[01:45.37]Well, let's warm up with a little bit of Splatoon.
[01:46.83]What do you think?
[01:49.05]I'm kidding.
[01:49.59]Relax.
[01:56.08]I'm kidding.
[01:59.46]Today's the last day of Overwatch 1?
[02:04.06]Um, oh.
[02:12.93]But, alright.
[02:13.67]Um.
[02:15.17]When was the last time I even played Overwatch 1?
[02:16.65]It's been a long time.
[02:25.35]He doesn't even care.
[02:25.95]I don't really play Overwatch.
[02:29.24]Should I play Overwatch 2?
[02:33.32]I mean, I'm sure I'll play it.
[02:34.26]I don't know if I'll stream it.
[02:36.10]Should I stream it?
[02:36.68]Take it for a day?
[02:37.46]Okay.
[02:47.05]No, you won't.
[02:52.25]That's a lot of no's.
[02:53.21]That's a lot of no's.
[03:05.86]Batting PvE.
[03:06.74]I mean, is it as good as the Splatoon PvE?
[03:10.42]That's my question.
[03:25.09]No thanks, we're good.
[03:33.45]You know what?
[03:34.46]I really hope Diablo 4 is good.
[03:37.88]You know what I mean?
[03:41.00]Look, I'm a Diablo Andy.
[03:45.06]Diablo is like, okay.
[03:47.56]Because I hated Diablo Immortal.
[03:49.74]It was like, I fucking despised it.
[03:51.35]I hated every second of it.
[03:53.99]It might be alright, right?
[03:56.42]Diablo 4 looks okay.
[03:58.46]From the things I've seen about it.
[03:59.52]I hope so.
[04:12.41]I hope so for your sake.
[04:15.95]No, it's alright.
[04:19.67]I will remember my fondness in Diablo II.
[04:24.08]Then Diablo 3 Reaper was good.
[04:27.17]They made a lot of good changes.
[04:29.11]Okay, Diablo 3 Reaper launch, like the first three or four months of that game, I thought were great.
[04:34.93]But then I didn't really like the subsequent patches.
[04:39.98]I think they did a pretty good job trying to get it back to life.
[04:50.28]Alright, correct me if I'm wrong.
[04:52.94]So I want to be corrected if I'm wrong.
[04:54.48]Because if I'm incorrect, I want people to say that's not correct.
[04:59.08]Did the game director for Reaper of Souls end up leaving Blizzard?
[05:05.10]Because... That's... Is that incorrect?
[05:11.60]That's not correct.
[05:12.96]That's correct.
[05:14.14]That's not correct.
[05:15.10]Great, thanks for the help.
[05:24.37]I love how somebody wrote probably.
[05:26.41]I'm just going to look it up because you guys aren't helpful.
[05:40.60]Let me see.
[05:42.28]Reaper of Souls director.
[05:52.60]Hold on.
[05:59.12]Hold on.
[06:01.06]Alright, yeah, he's gone.
[06:04.58]He left Blizzard in July of 2016.
[06:06.42]Well, I mean, isn't that one of the reasons why the game was better?
[06:15.99]I don't know.
[06:17.89]It was my fault?
[06:22.55]What did I do?
[06:25.45]Okay, my point is, in my opinion, the guy that made Diablo 3 a better game, and obviously there's tons of other people that worked on it, right?
[06:37.63]But I would have liked to see that person come back to D4.
[06:42.44]I don't know.
[06:42.82]I don't know the story.
[06:43.72]I have no idea, but I hope it's good.
[06:48.64]Look, I...
[06:51.27]Was Overwatch 1 fun?
[06:53.17]I thought it was kind of fun for the first, like, six months.
[06:56.65]I just didn't care as much as I did about, like, something like TF2.
[06:58.67]It just didn't have the staying power that TF2 had.
[07:02.26]And obviously, very obviously, I mean, you go back to my old YouTube channel, that it was like a, wow, here we go, Blizzard's making, like, a potential kind of FPS Nevies arcade TF2-like game.
[07:15.56]It was a big deal at the time.
[07:17.71]But it just didn't keep me.
[07:18.85]It just didn't.
[07:23.25]I did have fun with it though.
[07:24.23]I'm not going to lie.
[07:25.43]The first six months I thought were really fun.
[07:32.61]It was pretty pog before all the balancing.
[07:34.35]I thought it was fun.
[07:36.17]We'll see.
[07:37.61]Anyways, somebody said stop stalling.
[07:42.69]Um.
[07:47.36]Ban that person for life.
[08:06.02]Hide that guy.
[08:06.68]Hide him.
[08:09.05]Wait, I'm sick.
[08:09.99]I don't wanna.
[08:11.43]What?
[08:12.69]Alright, well.
[08:13.65]You get to stay.
[08:22.75]Please eat sushi.
[08:24.53]Why?
[08:24.79]That's a weird request.
[08:27.84]Do I like sushi?
[08:28.76]Yeah.
[08:29.84]I think it's good.
[08:30.26]Why do you want me to eat it?
[08:32.50]Why do you want me to eat sushi?
[08:35.16]Why?
[08:35.34]Why?
[08:40.73]Do a sushi tier list.
[08:42.57]OK, I'll do it right now.
[08:43.43]I don't even need it on the screen.
[08:45.57]Spicy tuna roll S tier.
[08:48.77]Salmon roll BA everything else F. Spicy tuna roll S tier pretty much everything else F. I'm not a huge sushi fan.
[09:12.36]Okay, I'm one of those people that will eat sushi and pretend like I think you made a good idea of ordering that.
[09:19.30]Oh, do you want to try it?
[09:20.78]Oh, it's, um... It's like a yellowfin or whatever, or a yellowtail or something, whatever it is.
[09:25.50]It's just like, oh, yeah, and then you eat it and you're like, oh, alright.
[09:30.18]Mmm, okay, oh, mm-hmm.
[09:34.71]You never want somebody to... Oh, wow, this is gross.
[09:36.67]No, I'm not going to say that.
[09:38.81]Because it's not.
[09:39.51]It's just kind of not my thing.
[09:43.06]I love spicy tuna.
[09:44.86]I like, uh... What's... People might think I'm insane for saying this.
[09:51.36]This is gonna make people probably gag when I say this.
[09:56.26]Uh, no, it's good, though.
[09:58.28]Is it weird for me to say this?
[10:00.79]I... Okay.
[10:01.93]I like a Philadelphia roll.
[10:03.09]If you don't know what a Philadelphia roll is, it's salmon, cream cheese, and avocado.
[10:16.01]I feel like people would think I was gross for saying that.
[10:18.85]But a lot of you are saying based and wow, good, good, good.
[10:22.43]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:23.51]He's basic.
[10:26.93]Hold on.
[10:28.07]Isn't the very nature of like true sushi basic?
[10:31.97]It's raw fish on rice.
[10:35.37]That's the very definition of a basic of basic.
[10:47.10]Basic doesn't mean bad.
[10:48.24]It's just very, hey, you got a little bit of raw fish laid on top of some rice.
[10:59.30]That's it.
[11:03.48]I'm actually, I'd rather eat that.
[11:04.88]I'm not into the like omega volcano roll where the thing comes out and it's like stacked four feet tall.
[11:17.98]well you know what I mean I don't it's like oh yeah well this is it we'll see it's eel and then there's a there's like a szechuan sauce on top of that and then on top of that is tuna and then on top it's like a kebab I don't I don't like those you can't eat them in one bite those are sushi kebabs those are I don't I don't really like I like eating it in one bite
[11:43.94]That's a Rick and Morty reference.
[11:45.08]I don't... Okay, if that's from this season, I haven't seen it.
[11:47.74]So, it's just... We both thought the same thing was funny.
[11:53.63]Anyways, let's play.
[12:03.35]Could you please consider streaming another shitty... I don't want to say the company.
[12:10.74]Just say the name of the company, right?
[12:12.72]Like, I'm not... Hey, can you please play this game from this shitty company?
[12:17.04]I don't want to say that out loud.
[12:24.90]No, no, stop.
[12:25.96]Stop it.
[12:30.34]Anyways, welcome to the stream.
[12:31.30]Hope you're having a good Sunday.
[12:33.23]yes this is going to be uh I will not be live I will I will not be live until I return from my October break I will not be live okay okay I will not be live okay
[13:03.48]I'll be back.
[13:10.89]Do a baseball stream rerun.
[13:12.79]Now I'm going to spend some time with friends, spend some time with some family.
[13:17.91]I feel like it's pretty overdue.
[13:27.01]But it's time to play Breath of the Wild.
[13:28.75]I've stalled for about, it's been two hours and 45 minutes on the Orbit in Soon screen.
[13:35.78]So that person was right.
[13:36.68]I'm sorry about that.
[13:37.60]And kind of just chilling for like two hours and two hours, 42 minutes, 2.41.
[13:41.24]Yeah.
[13:49.35]I thought we were your family.
[13:56.23]You guys are my Family Guy, not my family.
[13:58.57]Make sure you get it right.
[14:15.36]We're your PogChamps?
[14:16.62]What's that mean?
[14:24.62]How long is the break going to be?
[14:26.90]Um, it's probably going to be.
[14:31.82]Maybe like eight days.
[14:35.49]OK, it will be 8 to 10 days after the.
[14:40.33]OK, I'll be back in about 8 to 10 days after the last time you see me.
[14:50.38]On on camera.
[14:53.17]Okay.
[14:54.45]Cool.
[14:54.95]Alright, you understand.
[14:59.18]You're basically dead.
[15:00.20]I mean, no, like, I mean, like, not the last time.
[15:05.16]Whatever.
[15:05.48]Everybody just be quiet.
[15:12.61]Hi.
[15:13.95]Breath of the Wild, we're going to continue our playthrough.
[15:16.87]I believe it's this one right here.
[15:19.41]I just beat the Divine Beast.
[15:22.01]The elephant one.
[15:24.36]You wearing the shaggy shirt again?
[15:25.48]I am.
[15:26.34]It's clean though, don't worry.
[15:29.15]It's just so easy to wear, just, like, I don't, okay.
[15:32.19]Just solid colors are just so easy.
[15:34.15]I don't have to be like, what is this?
[15:35.45]Oh, just green.
[15:36.35]Green, easy.
[15:39.23]Like, gray.
[15:40.49]Blue.
[15:41.52]Easy, done.
[15:43.94]Can you eat a comedy sandwich?
[15:45.12]What is a comedy sandwich?
[15:50.49]Alright, okay, I just got... what did I just get?
[15:52.17]I got this thing.
[15:53.47]Alright, everyone said don't use this.
[16:04.32]A comedy sandwich is like... I don't know, cream cheese, onions, Tabasco sauce, and... Like a turkey leg or something, right?
[16:15.10]It's like, oh, haha, it's like a funny sandwich you made.
[16:20.85]That sounds pretty good.
[16:28.74]A knuckle sandwich, maybe.
[16:30.68]Are you gonna punch me in the face?
[16:34.56]Hey, I got a funny sandwich for you.
[16:36.42]It's right here.
[16:37.02]Alright, so where do I want to go?
[16:46.29]I beat this Divine Beast.
[16:49.53]I could go... Hold on, let me take a look.
[16:53.41]What do we got?
[16:57.41]Destroy Ganon.
[16:59.03]Where's this for, right?
[17:00.97]What area should I go to?
[17:02.01]I mean, the easy thing is just to kind of go up and over, right?
[17:14.14]If I went over here, then why not just kind of wrap around here?
[17:18.59]I have this marked for some reason, so I'm gonna go see why.
[17:20.71]We'll go to this pin.
[17:22.95]I think it's a shrine.
[17:24.69]And... Cool!
[17:32.12]Mm-hmm.
[17:34.38]Make a car tier list now.
[17:36.54]Um... I don't know anything about cars.
[17:49.47]What, like car types or car makers?
[17:53.09]Like Chevy, Ford, Chrysler.
[17:55.31]What do you mean?
[17:56.41]Oh, truck.
[17:58.03]Hatchback.
[17:58.78]What do you mean?
[17:59.16]Alright, how do I get out of here?
[18:07.20]I think I have to go this way.
[18:10.36]Yeah.
[18:10.86]Okay, I'm going to go this way.
[18:19.39]What are these?
[18:20.42]Alright, wait.
[18:21.72]Why do I have so many stamps on the map?
[18:26.08]Car companies.
[18:27.46]I don't know anything about car companies.
[18:32.04]I don't know anything about them.
[18:34.73]Wait.
[18:34.91]I have to turn this in, don't I?
[18:41.39]Here's the picture.
[18:41.89]This is the one I got.
[18:43.41]What do you think?
[18:45.17]Yeah, that's pretty damn good.
[18:53.99]My apologies, that sound was not very dignified, was it?
[18:58.04]Pardon me, I'm all better now.
[18:59.54]That Lionel, how terrifying.
[19:02.06]Well, look at this, and I doubt anyone would get any reckless ideas about visiting Ploymus Mountain.
[19:07.29]Well, here's a follow-up to that.
[19:08.87]He's dead.
[19:13.43]Send as many people up there as you want.
[19:16.28]I killed him.
[19:23.13]Oh, shit.
[19:23.91]Okay.
[19:27.69]This is part of the Zora set?
[19:34.24]For now.
[19:34.54]Cool.
[19:37.52]Cool.
[19:53.77]You can swim fast.
[19:57.27]Cool.
[19:59.97]You think they'll ever make, like, you know how it's like, oh, we have to have game difficulties.
[20:03.43]Do you think they'll have a game impatient modes?
[20:06.64]Where we just kind of use, like, Fallout 2 zero intelligence dialog.
[20:10.48]Like, get through the story and stuff.
[20:12.26]Or just, like, take these, they're good, make you swim fast.
[20:14.36]Oh, cool.
[20:14.78]Thanks.
[20:15.00]Appreciate it.
[20:19.85]Like, swim fast.
[20:21.23]You get equip if want.
[20:23.86]Oh, I get it.
[20:24.60]I understand it.
[20:25.52]I know what you're asking and telling me.
[20:29.28]I hope not.
[20:33.84]Do we put on caveman communication mode?
[20:36.10]I don't know.
[20:40.29]Sometimes you're just looking for... Did a bubble just come out of my mouth?
[20:44.83]Sometimes you're just looking for... You.
[20:45.91]Do this.
[20:46.65]Bye.
[20:47.13]Bye.
[20:51.57]It's kind of, I know I'm going to make a WoW reference, but it kind of reminds me of you just run around the town in WoW, pick up every single exclamation point, skip everything, and just hit M and look where you need to walk to the quest.
[21:04.18]That's it.
[21:05.72]You don't even read anything.
[21:07.88]Guys, I didn't even know what half of the quests were until I got to the point of the map where it was like a circle and it said kill that thing.
[21:14.10]I was like, oh, that's what I'm supposed to do here.
[21:19.88]Alright, so I don't think I can climb this mountain.
[21:22.99]Well, it's not raining anymore.
[21:23.81]Can I get up here?
[21:26.03]I'm going to try it.
[21:27.27]I think I can stand up there.
[21:38.29]Doesn't everyone do that with every MMO?
[21:41.11]I mean, probably.
[21:41.71]It's the most efficient way to level up.
[21:46.76]I shouldn't have done that.
[21:47.42]What an idiot.
[21:52.17]Okay, um, I definitely can get up there.
[21:55.67]I'm just so... I know I can get up there.
[22:01.43]Start here.
[22:09.19]Goddammit, hold on.
[22:13.63]Okay.
[22:17.35]I am gonna skip, like, 30 minutes of walking by doing this.
[22:25.73]You can go up the waterfall.
[22:27.36]Oh, wait.
[22:28.40]Oh, yeah, it is right there.
[22:30.48]It's been like a week.
[22:31.28]I haven't played in a week.
[22:33.68]It's been a while.
[22:34.40]I haven't played.
[22:35.04]Let me see if I can even do this.
[22:44.13]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[22:45.75]We're just going.
[22:46.25]Go up the waterfall.
[22:50.13]God Watcher, skip.
[22:50.91]No, if you skipped, you made a mistake, because look, now you skipped like 10 minutes, and you're like, where am I?
[22:54.56]What the fuck?
[22:54.98]I thought he was climbing a wall.
[22:56.28]Don't tell people to do that.
[23:05.15]Okay.
[23:06.65]Where's that waterfall?
[23:07.31]Right here?
[23:19.56]VOD watchers skip four minutes.
[23:21.98]If you're gonna skip less than five minutes in this stream... Come on.
[23:27.20]What are you skipping, really?
[23:31.91]Those of you that are saying VOD watchers skip two minutes are caveman communication difficulty Andes like me.
[23:39.91]I don't want to hear it ever again.
[23:44.01]What I just said got question marked, and now people are saying skip two minutes.
[23:47.91]Skip five minutes.
[23:48.61]Skip ten minutes.
[23:52.09]Isn't that what I just was talking about?
[23:53.39]Where's my mode where I just get to get to the parts where I want to see?
[23:56.27]I'm not going to die, right?
[24:08.46]I have stamina food, don't I?
[24:11.86]Oh, fuck.
[24:12.28]Hold on.
[24:13.50]Hold on.
[24:13.86]Eat the stamina food?
[24:14.64]Because I'm going to die if I don't.
[24:38.19]Skip to the next sorcery stream.
[24:48.67]There we are.
[24:59.36]You know, I just thought of a funny thing.
[25:00.92]What if... Alright, now it's over.
[25:03.99]All the VOD watchers skip.
[25:05.35]All the VOD watchers skip.
[25:06.57]What if I opened up sorcery and just played it for two minutes so people that skipped got just absolutely just screwed over, right?
[25:14.93]Like, wait, what?
[25:16.53]He's playing sorcery?
[25:18.29]What happened?
[25:19.80]Whatever, I'm out of here.
[25:23.56]And then that's what happens when you skip.
[25:31.76]And in that two-minute stretch of this stream, I talk about how Breath of the Wild is not for me.
[25:39.87]I'm not a big fan.
[25:40.49]I'm just going to play Souls 3.
[25:41.91]You know what I mean?
[25:42.91]So that'll teach you to skip five minutes.
[25:46.31]And then you just don't watch the rest?
[25:47.85]Mm-hmm.
[25:54.46]Camera was weird.
[25:55.02]Alright.
[26:02.96]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[26:11.48]Moblin guts.
[26:14.46]Can we just play the game?
[26:15.71]LOL.
[26:15.95]Yeah, alright.
[26:17.75]I did say that today was guaranteed to not be a crack stream.
[26:20.67]I did say that.
[26:22.53]You are right.
[26:25.49]That's very accurate.
[26:26.99]I did say that.
[26:31.02]Where are my pins?
[26:31.64]Alright.
[26:32.02]Well, I'm going to take this off.
[26:33.02]Wait, no, I'm not.
[26:34.94]Why is this pinned?
[26:37.12]Who did that?
[26:38.16]Okay.
[26:49.78]So we got one here.
[26:52.76]There is... Where else?
[27:00.48]You stole that, you stole his organs.
[27:06.26]Okay.
[27:09.28]Any others?
[27:14.74]Yep, over there.
[27:15.98]Okay.
[27:23.12]And one over here.
[27:24.26]Nice!
[27:24.72]Shrines!
[27:25.14]My favorite part.
[27:36.77]What is that thing?
[27:39.23]Oh, shit.
[27:39.65]Look at that one.
[27:40.11]Alright, I'm going to delete the other pins.
[27:47.19]I don't know what this was, but maybe someone will remember.
[27:54.82]So which one should I go to first?
[27:57.42]I'm going to say start on the left side, right?
[27:58.88]I don't know.
[28:02.30]I'm going over there.
[28:12.37]Go to the tower first.
[28:17.25]That one?
[28:21.00]That's the tower right there, right?
[28:22.44]Is there another one?
[28:25.90]Oh.
[28:27.60]Alright, we're gonna... Bro, I didn't see it!
[28:30.60]Look, I was looking like this.
[28:32.48]My field of view was this.
[28:35.23]I'm going like this.
[28:36.57]Down.
[28:38.07]See?
[28:38.56]It's not there.
[28:40.12]My eyes don't see it.
[28:40.98]No, it's not.
[28:42.06]It's not blind.
[28:43.52]Look.
[28:44.66]Do you see a tower?
[28:46.36]There's no tower on my screen.
[28:47.68]I'm going left.
[28:49.06]I'm looking for a shrine.
[28:50.50]Going right.
[28:51.54]I mean, it was like this.
[28:54.46]Now that I go like that, I can see it.
[28:56.28]It wasn't in frame.
[28:56.94]No, it wasn't.
[29:01.59]You went up.
[29:02.19]No, I didn't.
[29:03.05]But I wasn't looking.
[29:07.16]Alright, I'm going to go get the tower.
[29:10.14]Can I make it from here?
[29:15.46]What is that?
[29:24.14]I'm falling off the cliff.
[29:25.66]Because I thought I was zooming in.
[29:36.26]It's up on the D-pad.
[29:37.44]Okay.
[29:38.01]Guardian Skywatcher.
[29:39.43]What the hell is that?
[29:40.23]Okay.
[29:46.29]Alright.
[29:48.33]I'm going for it.
[29:49.36]Let's go.
[30:08.78]Alright, just don't go in that light.
[30:10.10]I'm just going up there.
[30:15.88]Oh, don't go over there.
[30:16.76]It's gonna go... Put that sword away.
[30:17.99]Put that sword away.
[30:18.51]Put that sword away.
[30:19.05]Put that sword away.
[30:19.63]I'm gonna use my fucking lightning.
[30:20.67]How do I... Okay, put... How do I put the weapons out?
[30:23.09]How do I unequip these?
[30:44.43]Alright.
[30:48.70]Thought I got hit.
[30:58.48]Jeez.
[31:06.39]Oh, you know what?
[31:06.99]Hold on.
[31:07.27]Let me put my climbing gear back on.
[31:22.66]Yeah.
[31:30.68]What the fuck?
[31:31.56]Alright, whatever.
[31:40.86]Well, very obviously, I'm going in the wrong direction.
[31:43.68]I can still... I think I can at least get on, like, the lip up there or something, right?
[31:56.56]Come on, get up and stand.
[31:58.36]Come on and just stand up.
[31:59.94]Come on, everybody just get up.
[32:01.41]Come on, put your hands up.
[32:02.87]Everybody just stand up.
[32:04.79]Come on, put your hands up.
[32:06.49]Everybody just stand up.
[32:10.85]I forgot about that.
[32:11.55]That's like my favorite song.
[32:15.60]Everybody put your hands up.
[32:17.40]Everybody just stand up.
[32:19.34]Everybody put your hands up.
[32:21.10]Everybody just stand up.
[32:27.47]That's like so fucking funny.
[32:29.40]It really is.
[32:30.14]It's genuinely funny.
[32:56.26]Well, I need to hear it now, right?
[32:57.82]Like, I have to listen to it now.
[33:01.16]There's no world where I don't put that on.
[33:14.63]What's it called?
[33:15.73]The American Bible Challenge.
[33:17.10]That's what it is.
[33:29.59]This is it, right?
[33:30.13]Okay.
[33:41.60]American Bible Challenge theme song.
[33:45.30]I want to be able to hear it.
[33:46.04]Because I have my headphones plugged in a different spot.
[33:51.78]Okay.
[33:54.11]I love this so much.
[33:55.07]You have no idea.
[34:23.95]One more time.
[34:24.41]And I think that's him singing it, right?
[34:42.63]Right?
[34:43.19]I think that's Jeff Foxworthy singing that.
[34:47.40]Is it?
[34:47.66]And then that makes it so much better.
[34:50.24]No, not one more time.
[34:50.88]We're done.
[34:53.56]No shot.
[34:57.12]I am not kidding.
[34:58.25]I genuinely like that.
[34:59.99]I love that song.
[35:01.89]It's so funny.
[35:02.85]It's perfect.
[35:04.23]I just love every second of it.
[35:06.59]Alright, I gotta plug this back in.
[35:07.85]Hold on.
[35:11.29]Everybody put your hands up.
[35:13.31]Hey, put your hands up and stand up too.
[35:15.84]Are your hands up yet?
[35:17.76]Stand up.
[35:18.84]And you better put your hands up.
[35:20.50]Everybody stand up.
[35:42.57]This is not a crack stream?
[35:43.75]Okay.
[35:59.60]Let's go.
[36:06.44]I can get up and stand up.
[36:08.71]Fuck!
[36:10.33]But I actually can, though.
[36:12.11]I actually can.
[36:12.99]I can.
[36:19.73]God damn it, I fell.
[36:25.19]I'm doing this the wrong- Ooh!
[36:41.26]Can I get up here this way?
[36:43.86]There's probably one path.
[36:47.72]I can't do it.
[36:48.80]I don't think I can do it.
[36:49.52]Alright, please tell me if I'm wa- Can I actually- Can I actually get up there?
[36:54.00]And can I actually stand up and put my hands up and climb up that?
[36:57.59]Can I do that?
[36:58.71]Or is- Am I just wasting time here?
[37:03.27]Yes.
[37:03.83]Okay.
[37:06.73]Oh, just- The weather's in the corner.
[37:08.65]Oh, alright.
[37:09.07]So it's gonna be rainy for like another few hours.
[37:15.95]Can I pass time?
[37:16.69]Alright, it's almost gone.
[37:27.38]Skies are going to clear up a little bit.
[37:42.28]Alright, we got clear skies.
[37:43.18]Let's go.
[37:55.17]You piece of shit.
[37:56.41]Really?
[37:57.71]Alright, the sky's gonna clear up actually in a minute.
[38:01.65]You have climbing clothes?
[38:02.45]They're on.
[38:19.65]Season's tier list.
[38:20.61]You got it.
[38:23.31]Well, where?
[38:23.97]What region?
[38:25.80]Where I am right now?
[38:28.28]In Las Vegas?
[38:31.58]Or what region?
[38:33.04]Because it depends.
[38:35.06]In Boston.
[38:35.78]New England.
[38:36.12]Alright.
[38:36.94]My favorite New England season?
[38:38.44]It's not summer.
[38:39.48]It's like hot.
[38:40.82]It's kind of gross.
[38:42.10]Sweaty.
[38:42.96]Humid.
[38:43.72]Mosquitoes.
[38:44.31]Bugs.
[38:44.81]Ticks.
[38:45.29]No thank you.
[38:46.87]Um... Spring?
[38:48.91]It's alright.
[38:50.63]It's cool.
[38:52.19]I'm a fall guy.
[38:53.57]I'm a fall guy from New England.
[38:56.85]And it has nothing to do with the trees all change colors.
[38:59.67]No.
[39:00.59]I like that fall air.
[39:03.82]The fall air is, even over here in Vegas, it hits different, doesn't it?
[39:10.27]There is a different smell.
[39:11.89]Did I wait too long and miss the fact that there was no rain?
[39:14.95]Whatever.
[39:17.56]Fall air, that like 60 degree fall air, has a certain sense to it.
[39:23.60]It's like that fall, slightly chilled, but like room temperature, on a kind of earthy sense.
[39:31.85]Do you know what I'm talking about?
[39:34.81]Fall has a certain smell.
[39:36.97]It's not a smell, it's like a sense.
[39:40.49]It's like crispy.
[39:41.76]Yes.
[39:42.96]It's a crispy sense in your like face.
[39:47.27]Ball is the best.
[39:57.85]Winter is cool, too.
[39:58.65]I like winter.
[40:00.33]Winter out in Vegas is actually really cool.
[40:02.89]Because it's so cold, but there's no snow.
[40:07.04]It's just really cold, but no snow, no precipitation.
[40:12.42]It's really interesting.
[40:13.96]So you can go- the air is so still and chilly, but there's never any snow.
[40:18.93]This is an NPC conversation.
[40:21.11]Like, you mean like a GTA NPC?
[40:23.69]Or, what do you mean by that?
[40:24.97]What?
[40:25.23]I- I can't talk about the weather?
[40:27.39]Why?
[40:31.11]What, like an NPC conversation, like in a game?
[40:33.78]This is a Morrowind NPC talking.
[40:47.05]Whatever.
[40:52.63]A Morrowind NPC does not- No, a Morrowind NPC is like this.
[40:57.09]Hello?
[40:58.83]Afternoon.
[40:59.26]Hello?
[41:02.96]They don't do that.
[41:09.16]Watch it!
[41:09.70]They don't say anything.
[41:16.38]The Mordor Wind NPC, yeah, is not going to give a weather tier list.
[41:19.16]What are you talking about?
[41:29.45]What the fuck?
[41:31.01]It's not raining.
[41:31.85]It's cloudy!
[41:32.61]It's supposed to be cloudy!
[41:33.67]Oh my goodness.
[41:50.87]I don't have a weapon.
[41:52.62]Oh, right.
[42:04.91]See ya.
[42:05.45]No!
[42:15.39]It stopped?
[42:16.35]I found the place to go.
[42:29.92]Oh my god, I annihilated that guy.
[42:38.17]Oh shit.
[42:40.47]What do I do?
[42:40.80]What do I do?
[42:41.62]What do I do?
[42:41.96]What do I do about that?
[42:42.76]What do I do?
[42:43.30]Should I hide?
[42:43.72]How do you hide?
[43:31.31]Man will always be smarter than machines.
[43:34.81]I'm gonna try to stand right up here.
[44:03.05]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[44:05.63]Got it.
[44:21.50]I got it.
[44:21.80]I made it.
[44:33.05]You're doing a lot of Switch stuff, huh?
[44:34.63]Yeah, I am.
[44:36.39]I'll get away from the Switch eventually here.
[44:38.95]But, to be fair, let's be fair.
[44:41.83]There was a long period where I did not turn this thing on for like eight months or something, right?
[44:50.12]Come on, it's only fair.
[44:59.84]Are you going to finish the game on stream?
[45:01.48]I don't know.
[45:03.28]I can tell you all that I know.
[45:04.66]And what I know is I'm very much enjoying playing it on stream and hanging out.
[45:09.96]Until that stops being the case.
[45:11.82]Until I want to finish it off.
[45:13.14]I don't know.
[45:13.98]I'm still here.
[45:14.46]What did that even do?
[45:18.95]I thought that was going to clear all the goo.
[45:24.23]Oh my god.
[45:24.99]Get out of that.
[45:26.01]Get out of it.
[45:28.37]You better.
[45:28.83]Alright.
[45:29.97]You're not going to tell me what I should and should not do.
[45:33.15]Okay.
[45:39.33]Understand me?
[45:45.56]There's probably a few of them that I have to get rid of, right?
[45:49.58]Hmm.
[45:56.34]See any more eyes?
[46:01.02]Ooh.
[46:01.42]I thought that was a chest.
[46:07.35]We got sword.
[46:08.63]Rusty sword.
[46:09.87]Rusty shield.
[46:10.51]I'll take it.
[46:11.81]I can cook, but I don't... I don't... Ah.
[46:18.07]I'm not going to take it, actually.
[46:19.19]Never mind.
[46:20.87]I have tons of food.
[46:21.65]I don't need to cook.
[46:22.17]Oh, it's emote only mode.
[46:27.31]That means there's a puzzle.
[46:28.43]There's a puzzle to foot.
[46:29.62]Okay.
[46:29.74]Okay.
[46:43.95]Can you shoot these?
[46:51.26]Okay.
[46:59.30]I'm going to blow these up, though.
[47:13.56]Wasn't that nothing?
[47:15.49]Nothing?
[47:15.85]Alright, I'm just going to turn it on.
[47:23.39]I got four shrines.
[47:24.49]This is going to be a shrine stream.
[47:35.87]Okay, so...
[47:40.87]Why does he keep over fucking reacting?
[47:42.39]It's like annoying.
[47:44.55]Time the person out.
[47:54.75]Oh, you can't even write.
[47:55.89]Never mind.
[47:56.83]I can't gaslight you guys.
[48:01.42]It's emote only.
[48:02.56]Never.
[48:02.82]I didn't even look.
[48:23.98]This thing's been... Oh, never mind.
[48:25.08]It's going to break.
[48:29.22]Broken.
[48:29.66]Alright, let's use the club.
[48:40.11]Ooh, can I sneak in there?
[48:48.53]Wow, that thing's actually really powerful.
[48:49.81]24.
[48:59.76]That's better than the Lionel sword.
[49:04.80]Whatever.
[49:05.06]I'll take it.
[49:07.45]Okay.
[49:08.03]So, let me go over here.
[49:08.87]I can sneak in here.
[49:11.19]I can't find it.
[49:12.77]Did you hear the sound?
[49:40.36]I'm exploring.
[49:40.88]Don't tell me to hurry up.
[49:41.68]I never would have found this chest if I did.
[49:46.10]Nice.
[49:52.87]Nice.
[49:53.19]100 rupees.
[49:59.11]Now... Why is it on emote only, by the way?
[50:03.87]This seems pretty self-explanatory, doesn't it?
[50:05.95]I mean, now it does.
[50:08.59]I can't hit that, like, piece of sinew, whatever it is.
[50:14.59]There's definitely another eyeball somewhere hiding, right?
[50:34.24]Or maybe not.
[50:38.54]There's definitely an eyeball attached to this sinew.
[50:54.85]See you later.
[51:12.62]There's an eye somewhere.
[51:14.18]It has to be.
[51:16.11]It's definitely... It's got to be definitely attached to the sinew.
[51:18.29]Can I break that?
[51:28.69]Where's this eye?
[51:41.24]Well, I'll go over here.
[51:49.74]Alright.
[51:52.14]Now what?
[52:16.08]I need some more weapons.
[52:17.38]I'm out of shitty weapons to use.
[52:26.44]Wait a minute.
[52:27.42]Can I burn it?
[52:29.74]I can burn it!
[52:31.20]I think I can burn it.
[52:34.82]Can I burn the sinew?
[52:37.97]No.
[52:40.55]Or can I?
[52:40.91]No.
[52:53.43]Where is this thing?
[52:55.79]The inside of my... My brain is itching.
[52:58.29]The inside of my ear all the way in is itching.
[53:07.10]What?
[53:08.38]Oh.
[53:12.80]There's an eyeball just sitting hidden somewhere and I gotta find this stupid eye.
[53:35.78]Is it in here?
[53:44.28]Shit.
[53:49.69]No, no, no, no, no.
[53:58.41]Oh my god, I almost died.
[53:59.66]I'm alright.
[54:13.28]I really hope there's no goo up here.
[54:15.94]Uh-oh.
[54:16.88]I can't climb that?
[54:18.88]Why?
[54:19.24]Oh, shit.
[54:21.18]Hold on.
[54:21.52]Okay.
[54:41.78]I tried to jump, but he jumped up and not back.
[54:45.42]How do you jump backwards?
[54:48.48]I wanted to jump backwards.
[54:51.75]I don't want to jump.
[54:52.25]How do you jump out?
[54:52.91]I didn't want to jump up.
[54:54.43]How do you jump out?
[55:13.53]Where is this thing?
[55:19.52]Oh, there's a chest over there.
[55:20.98]Cool.
[55:26.26]It has to be something with the fire.
[55:27.40]It has to be with the fire.
[55:28.81]Don't not like this me.
[55:30.69]Bomb arrow.
[55:31.33]Alright.
[55:31.85]It's got to be like explode something.
[56:02.99]I don't know.
[56:03.41]There's no eye.
[56:16.85]I'm looking for another eye.
[56:32.91]Goat.
[56:33.77]Or fish.
[56:34.89]What?
[56:41.64]Should I release them?
[56:43.48]No.
[56:43.80]Not yet.
[56:52.33]Nope.
[57:34.33]I don't understand what's happening.
[57:35.23]I don't get it.
[57:41.50]Can I... Can I do this right now?
[57:43.80]Do I have to come back here later?
[57:50.28]Grab!
[57:58.56]I'm gonna try... Okay.
[58:00.10]Can I even hurt this stuff?
[58:01.12]Or do I have to hit... I was under the impression you couldn't hurt this shit.
[58:05.72]Oh my god, dude.
[58:06.60]Like, you have to destroy the eyeball.
[58:09.26]That's the only way.
[58:10.20]But can I bomb the sinew?
[58:13.80]I'll try it.
[58:14.86]I mean, I'm lost.
[58:16.18]I'm gonna bomb that sinew right there. ...
[58:46.16]Wait.
[58:48.18]Soccer ball kick.
[58:50.08]Catch.
[58:50.72]Kapow.
[58:51.56]Referee.
[58:52.44]Touchdown.
[58:57.44]What is that?
[58:58.12]Shoot the cannons at it?
[59:03.32]Shoot the cannons at the... Alright.
[59:05.02]Shoot the cannons.
[59:09.48]Shoot.
[59:10.14]Turn the cannons around and fire the cannons at that.
[59:15.87]Shoot the bomb through the touchdown.
[59:23.00]Shoot ball.
[59:23.92]Ball goes touchdown.
[59:26.34]Fly torch.
[59:40.71]Ball goes touchdown.
[59:42.17]Santa Claus.
[59:42.91]There's no Santa Claus here.
[59:48.19]Catch... Catch football, throw football, touchdown.
[59:51.97]I don't know.
[59:59.73]What?
[60:00.85]What are you talking about?
[60:07.19]Cold.
[60:08.41]Chill, throw, touchdown.
[60:19.69]Is there a place where I can put a bomb?
[60:21.73]That's something over here, right?
[60:28.71]Oh my god, what the f- What?
[60:43.48]Hold on.
[61:07.69]Oh shit, my cover!
[61:08.92]Oh no!
[61:09.50]Um...
[61:30.40]Dude!
[61:50.30]You fucking idiot.
[62:10.53]Let him out.
[62:11.09]Let him out.
[62:11.43]Let him out.
[62:11.75]Let him out.
[62:11.99]I don't care.
[62:12.27]Let him out.
[62:12.59]Let him out.
[62:12.99]Let him out.
[62:13.31]Let him out.
[62:13.77]Let him out.
[62:14.11]Tell me.
[62:14.43]Just give me the solution right now.
[62:16.45]Just tell me the answer.
[62:18.35]I'm going to get kicked out of class.
[62:19.23]I'm going to get detention.
[62:20.09]I'm going to stand up right now in the middle of the test.
[62:21.79]I want the... Give me the answer.
[62:30.24]Climb to just climb.
[62:34.28]What?
[62:40.02]I thought it was a puzzle.
[62:42.14]Just climb?
[62:43.80]Just climb is the answer?
[62:45.63]No, it can't be.
[62:47.35]Just climb.
[62:49.99]It's not a puzzle or like, oh, I gotta get like a puzzle shit.
[62:57.33]Just climb it.
[63:01.11]There's a magnetized platform?
[63:09.34]But what was the football thing with the hands up?
[63:13.55]Climbing is the puzzle.
[63:36.15]I pressed B!
[63:37.33]Why did it not register?
[63:42.15]Hold on, let me just heal.
[63:51.53]Okay.
[63:52.89]So, just climb up, but there's a magnetized thing?
[63:56.01]Dude, okay, I'm getting sick and gosh darn tired of that happening.
[64:04.05]It just doesn't register the jump.
[64:05.97]It's not the controller, it's the game's input engine.
[64:09.49]Okay?
[64:32.38]Okay, so what the heck?
[64:37.43]There's a magnetized platform.
[64:42.05]I tried climbing up that side.
[64:43.63]Use the stasis.
[64:45.83]Oh.
[64:45.95]Whoops.
[65:00.08]Oh my god, Link, stop just gluing to every single surface.
[65:03.32]Alright.
[65:05.02]Down by the eye that you killed, there's a magnetized thing.
[65:20.08]Who the fuck was that?
[65:23.08]I- What is happening?
[65:24.80]Why is it not- I'm pissing off!
[65:27.38]I'm getting pissed off, actually.
[65:29.14]How come I can't activate it?
[65:44.83]This is where the eye was killed.
[65:56.57]You just passed it?
[65:57.47]Huh?
[66:18.56]It's outside.
[66:27.61]What?!
[66:34.80]This is the- this was the solution?! !
[67:06.47]I'm not going to die to the sludge.
[67:09.03]This little metallic door buried in the goo is the solution to the puzzle?
[67:12.83]Okay.
[67:14.67]Get out of here.
[67:29.30]This guy takes a lot of hits.
[67:44.84]Okay.
[67:47.10]Yeah, so what now?
[67:47.94]What did you mean by it's the uprights?
[67:52.82]That's a good shield.
[67:53.54]Alright, so now I can put this over here.
[67:55.38]Bro.
[67:58.74]Bro.
[68:03.80]You talking about, do this, and then it'll fall like that.
[68:06.85]Oh, come on, dude.
[68:08.13]What the fuck?
[68:09.71]What?
[68:10.05]I'm sitting here looking for eyeballs to kill, because I thought it was going to get rid of all the- whatever.
[68:24.04]That's- how is that a touchdown?
[68:27.74]That's not a touchdown.
[68:32.71]Okay.
[68:33.88]Well, that was fun.
[68:37.54]Let me throw this away.
[68:38.50]Because this thing is 40.
[68:43.08]So people are saying you can actually just climb it, up it.
[68:50.63]Can you though?
[68:51.35]I feel like every... I tried to climb that, it wouldn't let me do it.
[68:56.31]Do you like damage, just hurt, just go?
[69:03.52]You can't though.
[69:04.88]You can.
[69:05.84]It's the pillar.
[69:06.86]Okay.
[69:10.88]What's wrong with my character?
[69:17.91]You can jump off the half arch.
[69:23.81]That took so long.
[69:25.92]I've... Oh, I'm cold.
[69:28.24]Okay.
[69:28.40]Okay.
[69:35.37]Is there a... Does this make me warmer?
[69:40.23]I don't think so.
[69:45.41]That literally took an hour?
[69:46.30]No, it didn't.
[69:48.76]It took like 25 minutes.
[69:51.08]I had like a 30 minute opening of the stream.
[69:54.12]And then I was walking around for a little bit and I spent 20 minutes.
[69:58.34]Do not add an hour just because it makes it funnier.
[70:02.25]It was 20 minutes.
[70:25.75]eat something, you're gonna die.
[70:26.66]I'll be alright.
[70:31.38]Alright, look!
[70:33.38]Hey, we made it!
[70:34.58]We made it!
[70:57.26]how is that kicking a football I somebody give me a full sentence I want a complete sentence on how throwing a football through the uprights is what I had to do there the hands he makes
[71:31.23]It was gaslighting.
[71:33.29]Throw down the path bridge to go up.
[71:38.05]At the arch you have to touch down the plank.
[71:42.58]The hands point up, you can climb up.
[71:51.42]It's the shape of the magnet?
[71:53.99]Oh my god, what?
[71:56.29]It is the shape of a magnet.
[71:59.67]And you were saying I needed to pick... Okay.
[72:02.03]Well, I would never have gotten that.
[72:07.70]That's so funny.
[72:08.46]Alright, cold resistance.
[72:14.22]This one here?
[72:14.68]Alright.
[72:20.18]Look, I got it.
[72:20.74]Alright, now let me do what I want to do.
[72:22.13]The thing that I like doing the most.
[72:23.47]And that's go to the shrines.
[72:24.85]Should I go to this one first?
[72:36.91]Which one should I do first?
[72:41.88]I'm just gonna go to this one first, whatever.
[72:43.10]Fuck it.
[72:43.56]This one.
[73:09.25]Alright.
[73:09.77]Yes!
[73:10.27]Let's play.
[73:20.51]Let's go.
[73:21.07]Yes!
[73:21.41]A shrine.
[73:21.83]Okay, bye for like another 30 minutes.
[73:34.36]I'm gonna do this in 15 minutes.
[73:43.56]Goodbye.
[73:44.24]See you in 15 minutes when it's done.
[73:46.64]See you in 15 minutes tops when it's done.
[73:48.78]What time is it right now?
[73:52.45]It is 4.11 right now, PM Pacific.
[73:55.47]At 4... 21... At 4.26.
[73:56.15]You'll be let out.
[74:01.51]Alright, here we go.
[74:41.72]Got it.
[75:12.11]Time is it?
[75:13.10]412.
[75:13.14]It's been one minute.
[75:13.81]I'm almost done.
[75:50.20]Do not bet against me.
[75:52.56]Just saying.
[75:53.84]Don't bet against me.
[75:54.54]Gonna surprise a few people here, I think.
[76:03.75]Hmm, okay.
[76:11.51]Very cool.
[76:13.78]What's next?
[76:15.78]Alright.
[76:18.14]Cool.
[76:18.60]Alright, just checking out some stuff.
[76:21.49]Very nice.
[76:21.95]Alright, what's this?
[76:25.84]Okay, let's go.
[77:35.09]I'm going to scream so bad just to get the energy out, you know what I mean?
[77:37.57]Just like... Reset it.
[77:52.06]Oh, look at that.
[77:52.94]Let's bet against him.
[77:56.32]Let's bet against him.
[77:57.78]Time is it?
[77:58.63]Oh, how much time do I have?
[78:03.11]Oh, look at that.
[78:04.31]Who bet against me?
[78:06.63]Which one?
[78:07.46]Which one of you bet against me?
[78:08.44]Who did?
[78:11.10]It's 4.15 right now.
[78:12.78]I'm 11 minutes early.
[78:14.38]I'm just saying.
[78:27.25]I'm 11 minutes early.
[78:33.51]Literally the easiest shrine.
[78:36.49]Well, why did you bet against me then?
[78:39.07]That's your fault.
[78:45.09]How do I get the... I have two, by the way.
[78:49.44]I'm covering the screen, you know.
[78:55.72]I lost a million points.
[78:56.94]Ooh.
[78:59.76]I did say don't bet against me.
[79:01.94]I made it very clear.
[79:07.71]You didn't get the chest?
[79:08.91]Well, I completed the shrine.
[79:10.01]I'll go back in.
[79:12.37]Could I have picked something up?
[79:30.84]The rules for completion are getting the orb.
[79:32.30]Yeah.
[79:33.74]Come on.
[79:52.69]Nice.
[79:52.99]Alright, so how do I get this?
[79:58.36]Oh.
[79:59.60]Okay.
[80:02.50]That was interesting.
[80:03.80]Um... Ow!
[80:20.12]Alright, so now... Um...
[80:26.94]I mean, I think I have to walk on this.
[80:30.42]Can I hit it with a bow?
[80:37.13]Oops-a-daisy.
[80:37.89]Okay, what?
[80:49.34]Where is it?
[80:51.10]Do I jump on that?
[80:51.76]I don't get it.
[80:54.54]How do I stop it?
[81:09.48]Good luck.
[81:11.00]I'm imagining I have to... Can I stop that?
[81:14.78]I don't get it.
[81:17.04]I'm going to run out of arrows.
[81:35.71]Oh, come on.
[81:38.60]Alright, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[81:42.54]You gotta get the lip.
[81:43.74]It is stuck on the lip.
[81:54.55]Yeah, it's stuck on the lip, Andy.
[81:56.69]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.
[81:58.67]Oh my fucking god, just do it.
[82:06.29]Just do it and stop.
[82:15.05]There's gonna be an apple in this chest.
[82:16.41]It's not gonna be worth doing.
[82:17.27]Oh my god, don't jump.
[82:30.21]Why am I jumping?
[82:31.15]Just crouch.
[82:35.02]I'm gonna have no arrows.
[82:35.88]It's so stupid.
[82:46.69]If there... Alright, if there are five arrows in this chest, I'm gonna uninstall the game.
[82:59.85]Goddammit.
[83:19.42]Hold on.
[83:32.74]Oh, thank God.
[83:34.70]Don't screw this up.
[83:43.58]Alright, I'm glad it's not five arrows because I didn't want to uninstall the game.
[83:50.81]How do I get out of here?
[84:03.76]Pick up your arrows?
[84:04.98]Oh my god, I forgot you could do that.
[84:06.88]Alright, I gotta pee.
[84:12.38]I'll be back.
[84:14.05]Pee time.
[84:16.92]That's where I deserve ping.
[84:18.33]By the way, it's 421.
[84:19.59]Even if I did that, it still wouldn't be 426.
[84:21.55]I still, whoever bet against me still lose.
[84:25.01]One sec.
[86:26.27]Why'd I die?
[86:29.37]Oh, because it's cold.
[86:30.53]Right.
[86:32.93]I froze.
[86:38.46]Okay.
[86:39.84]That was cool.
[86:40.52]That was a fun one.
[86:42.74]Let's do another one.
[86:44.96]Where's the other one?
[86:45.50]There's a couple other here.
[86:46.20]There's that one.
[86:47.69]I'm going to go to that one down there.
[86:49.85]Get a big oaf.
[86:57.83]My favorite part about this game is that there's atmosphere.
[87:00.41]So when you go higher in the atmosphere, it gets colder.
[87:08.92]Yeah, I think so.
[87:22.77]Holy shit.
[87:23.51]Yes.
[87:35.89]A weirdo.
[87:38.61]Ooh, this one right there.
[87:39.95]Alright, I'm going to go to this one and that one.
[87:54.10]Should we place bets again?
[88:02.98]This way, that way, this way, that way.
[88:17.47]What if a middle hair part?
[88:18.57]I don't know.
[88:22.35]My hair naturally just parts that way, I think.
[88:25.55]Yeah.
[88:25.97]I mean, I can do this, but... Show Otto?
[88:35.24]I showed Otto like a week ago.
[88:36.40]He's fine.
[88:37.54]He's just chilling.
[88:39.50]He's just chilling.
[88:41.42]Chilling out in his bed.
[88:43.49]Chewing on a bone.
[88:44.29]He's having fun.
[88:44.81]I don't want to disturb him.
[88:55.54]Alright, let's do 15 minutes.
[88:58.32]Let's go.
[88:58.66]It's 4.26 right now.
[89:03.99]That's 36.
[89:06.79]At 4.41.
[89:08.61]I will have this completed.
[89:10.21]4.41.
[89:10.25]Let's go.
[89:10.69]Done.
[89:11.39]Easy.
[89:12.09]This will be the easiest one all night.
[89:16.84]That was on purpose.
[89:17.54]If you didn't know, I did that on purpose to make a funny thing so everyone would go, oh my God, he got hit by the rock rolling.
[89:23.74]Actually true.
[89:24.38]I actually did that on purpose.
[89:26.80]And if you, people are like, oh, he's like pretending that he did it on purpose and like pretending that it wasn't on purpose, right?
[89:32.77]No, I did that on purpose.
[89:34.19]I want to make that really clear and transparent with everybody here.
[89:40.29]I'm not kidding.
[89:41.03]Okay.
[89:41.19]Alright.
[89:41.99]So let's obviously, we have to freeze that.
[89:55.78]Okay, we're good.
[89:56.40]Alright.
[90:02.54]Did I shut this one off?
[90:07.32]I broke this one.
[90:08.16]Okay.
[90:11.62]That one's magical.
[90:12.44]Why is that one magical?
[90:14.90]Oh, they're all... Okay, never mind.
[90:41.17]This game's fucking easy.
[90:51.44]Shit.
[91:05.35]Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
[91:06.47]Skip.
[91:06.73]I just can't die.
[91:07.49]Just don't die and I'll be fine.
[91:11.84]I can pick those ones up.
[91:14.24]Weird.
[91:14.90]Oh, what?
[91:17.15]Weird.
[91:17.73]I can pick those up.
[91:19.45]Strange.
[91:20.89]What is that for?
[91:21.81]Weird.
[91:35.77]Interesting.
[91:36.52]Kind of weird.
[91:37.94]Okay.
[91:38.50]Weird.
[91:49.34]That's good.
[91:50.10]I'll take it.
[92:04.13]Thank God.
[92:04.57]Alright.
[92:07.25]There's only one of these, right?
[92:10.44]Alright, I got a plan.
[92:38.17]Imagine voting against me.
[92:44.01]Imagine voting against me.
[92:45.57]Right?
[92:46.09]Some of you guys probably just lost twice in a row.
[92:59.90]That's three spirit orbs.
[93:03.46]I got the chest too.
[93:07.24]It's 11 minutes early.
[93:10.18]I should drop it to 10 minutes.
[93:15.30]The game is quiet.
[93:17.12]I'll take care of that.
[93:26.17]That's one of the easiest in the game.
[93:27.21]So vote accordingly then.
[93:28.21]Alright.
[93:32.87]Where's the other one?
[93:33.41]I'm going to do all these shrines.
[93:34.39]I love them.
[93:38.84]A lot of people say that their favorite part of this game is when Link goes, but mine is the shrines.
[93:46.43]I would say.
[94:10.90]You're wrong.
[94:11.38]Alright, let's do.
[94:15.28]I'm going to keep teleporting back here and just fly to them so much easier than walking.
[94:29.39]Where is that other one?
[94:31.57]Oh, right here.
[94:35.89]This is a bad idea.
[94:43.89]Wasn't there another one down here?
[94:48.47]If I land over here, I think it should be fine.
[94:59.11]Watch out for this butthead.
[95:00.05]Shh.
[95:24.40]Yeah, sorry.
[95:35.72]Yeah, my language is pretty bad.
[95:38.87]I'm sorry.
[95:41.31]How are you?
[95:42.43]Is this water too cold or something?
[95:48.07]Am I going to get hurt in here?
[96:01.47]I made it.
[96:11.77]Wait, what's this?
[96:14.15]Ooh, radishes.
[96:16.09]I should have taken a picture of it.
[96:16.97]I'm an idiot.
[96:18.24]These things are one of the most high quality foods in the game.
[96:21.88]And... What?
[96:22.64]In real life.
[96:40.42]Looking for one of those little seed guys, whatever.
[96:52.25]Walk off the cliff?
[96:53.11]Oh.
[96:57.41]Alright, where is it?
[96:57.87]It's right there.
[97:04.59]Drop it, then take a picture.
[97:07.57]Oh, so it still works that way?
[97:09.31]Oh, it does still work.
[97:09.93]You're right.
[97:12.22]You're right.
[97:12.50]I like this area.
[97:24.20]Uh-oh.
[97:27.73]Bandits.
[97:28.13]Uh-oh.
[97:32.31]Bandits.
[97:33.23]Bandits.
[97:39.96]Let's go.
[97:42.97]Alright, 10 minutes.
[97:46.45]When I press the button, I'm making it easier for you if you want to bet against me.
[97:50.27]10 minutes.
[97:56.07]Time's at 435.
[97:56.37]Wait till I get in.
[98:07.33]This doesn't count yet.
[98:07.93]I have to get actually into the shrine.
[98:11.13]You have to get the chest too?
[98:12.53]No.
[98:13.57]It's just for the shrine.
[98:29.58]If you're reading this, I hope you're having a good day.
[98:31.02]Hey, you too.
[98:33.06]Thank you.
[98:35.16]Alright.
[98:35.48]I got 10 minutes to complete the shrine.
[98:36.72]Let's go.
[98:40.60]Minor test of strength.
[98:41.58]Oh, you guys.
[98:42.65]Whoever bet it against me.
[98:44.85]You've got... I don't know.
[98:46.13]You've got some time here.
[98:56.48]Seriously?
[98:56.96]I think this is free money for anybody that's going to bet for me.
[99:01.60]This is free money.
[99:02.40]You're literally watching it right now.
[99:03.48]You can still bet.
[99:04.08]It's free money.
[99:07.78]This is free money.
[99:08.58]I'm just telling you right now, you're going to get channel points for free.
[99:11.88]It's free money.
[99:23.88]I mean, it's free money.
[99:35.37]I forgot the move set, but it's free money.
[99:37.33]It's actually free money.
[99:38.44]Watch.
[100:05.51]It's free money.
[100:06.83]Literally, it's free money.
[100:07.69]You just... I don't understand.
[100:09.55]The timer wasn't even over yet.
[100:15.62]Oh, hell yeah.
[100:16.42]Ancient battle axe.
[100:21.24]Dude, the timer wasn't even over and you still could have got it.
[100:28.03]You cheated.
[100:28.59]You eated.
[100:30.21]What?
[100:31.89]This isn't Dark Souls PvP.
[100:37.89]Cheated, he eated.
[100:39.11]Cheated, he eated.
[100:39.91]Oh, please.
[100:46.13]Giant ancient core.
[100:48.89]Extremely rare find.
[100:50.21]Ooh.
[101:06.18]Ancient armor?
[101:07.04]Ooh.
[101:12.44]Don't.
[101:13.10]Please save those.
[101:13.84]Don't make anything.
[101:14.70]Okay.
[101:15.84]I got four.
[101:16.22]I'm going to do stamina.
[101:20.90]But I'm not doing it until I have at least a double turn in.
[101:23.18]That's how it works.
[101:33.38]What was it?
[101:33.78]It was 90% voted that you were going to do it.
[101:37.49]It's so funny, I think the, like, 4% of you that voted that I was not gonna do that, I think we're banking on, uh, like, my house getting struck by lightning and the power going out, right?
[101:48.98]Like, it's like, it could happen.
[101:50.46]It could.
[101:51.54]And you'd get a huge return, but it's not probable.
[101:57.34]It's like, man, it's possible that, like, his internet just goes out now, right?
[102:01.63]It's possible, but not completely, not probable, it's possible.
[102:07.78]Alright, where was that last one?
[102:23.09]You were too overconfident, that's why I doubted.
[102:25.19]Oh, 75 million versus 3.5 million.
[102:33.44]Damn.
[102:35.35]Wait, does that mean that the people that bet the 3.5 million, it goes to the people that bet their points?
[102:42.31]That's how that works, right?
[102:43.33]So, would you guys get, like, 50 points each?
[102:47.65]That was, what, that probably wasn't, I mean, that's a safe return, but it's not a big return.
[102:54.30]We've basically gotten nothing.
[102:56.89]The three and a half million got split to everyone.
[102:58.95]That's so funny.
[103:00.21]I got 10k.
[103:01.21]I got 2k.
[103:03.13]I got 150 points.
[103:06.64]I got 6k.
[103:07.60]I bet 6k and I got 6.9k back.
[103:10.30]Okay.
[103:13.42]Safe return.
[103:15.00]That was a safe investment you made.
[103:22.97]Where the hell am I?
[103:23.53]Wait, what?
[103:25.80]Oh, I went to the wrong place.
[103:34.07]The people that were betting no had a 22.5 time return if they won.
[103:41.48]That's a lot.
[103:55.47]Bring back, you need channel point rewards?
[103:57.05]I know.
[103:57.31]The thing is, I need to find a way to make something for channel points that's not gonna just, like, destroy every stream.
[104:07.78]Those of you that remember, when channel points first came out, and it was like, oh, what do I do with these?
[104:12.41]I had a thing where you could redeem a certain amount of, was it 100,000 or 75,000 to make me wink on camera.
[104:19.91]And it's like, oh, that's funny.
[104:21.03]It's like 100,000 points.
[104:22.37]That's a lot of points.
[104:24.22]And people were redeeming them every 15 to 25 seconds at one point.
[104:27.70]It's just like, I can't do that.
[104:29.72]I'm not going to wink every fucking 30 seconds.
[104:32.10]It's weird.
[104:34.08]And then eventually I just stopped doing it.
[104:35.61]And then I did one where I just caught up and did it like 5,000 times or something, right?
[104:43.29]Alright.
[104:43.53]So where was it?
[104:44.17]There was one more.
[104:45.39]Where was it?
[104:49.19]I swear there was one more.
[104:50.23]Am I crazy?
[104:57.77]There was definitely one more.
[105:00.13]What was it?
[105:02.70]Check the pins.
[105:06.54]Well, the problem with the pins is I never removed them.
[105:10.74]Wait.
[105:11.50]There's a pin right there.
[105:15.12]What is that pin for?
[105:18.09]What did I pin?
[105:24.98]What did I pin?
[105:25.60]I think it was this one down here.
[105:31.86]Did I do them all?
[105:33.66]It's in a canyon.
[105:36.28]Down here?
[105:36.68]I just don't... Down, down, down.
[105:45.13]Where?
[105:46.29]Look down.
[105:48.73]Where is it?
[105:53.02]It's between these two.
[105:54.90]Where?
[105:57.22]Where is it?
[105:58.79]Down there, right?
[105:59.59]Down here.
[106:03.29]It's like down here, right?
[106:09.40]Yeah, yeah, I know.
[106:24.45]Minimap.
[106:27.03]No, yeah, I know.
[106:27.61]I was just making sure I headed in the right place.
[106:28.95]Hey, Sunglasses Andy, look at the minimap.
[106:34.95]I know.
[106:35.45]Look where I'm going.
[106:36.09]I'm going in the right direction.
[106:40.04]Why am I Sunglasses Andy?
[106:41.12]What does that mean?
[106:49.18]Smarten up, fuckface.
[106:55.88]I like that comment, that's funny.
[106:58.01]Smart, no.
[107:08.52]Alright, 10 minutes.
[107:11.35]It is 444.
[107:12.88]The second that I go in here, the timer begins.
[107:19.50]I would start to bet now, because we don't want to give anybody... No, you know what?
[107:24.88]Forget that.
[107:25.94]It starts... I'm not going in here yet.
[107:31.68]We're waiting until people bet, because I don't want people to get an advantage.
[107:36.70]It's the timer starts not 450, not 455.
[107:39.68]It starts when I go in here because I don't want people to get an advantage.
[107:42.26]Because they're going to see, oh, it's a minor combat test.
[107:46.88]I'm going to bet this way, right?
[107:50.08]So it's not 455.
[107:51.06]It's like 456 or something, right?
[107:55.85]Yeah, so you don't get to know.
[107:57.33]You have to bet now without knowing what it is.
[108:02.77]Oh, wait.
[108:03.29]Did we refund?
[108:07.51]One wink a year.
[108:08.17]I just burnt my eye when I did that.
[108:12.27]I hope you all know.
[108:13.93]There you go.
[108:14.43]Yeah.
[108:14.57]Well, I beat this in 10 minutes.
[108:22.03]The thing is, a lot of you guys have played this game.
[108:23.95]Why am I acting like the game came out a week ago?
[108:26.82]This game's been out for like four and a half years.
[108:29.44]So a lot of you guys know what is in here.
[108:31.62]So...
[108:33.19]Those of you that don't know what's in here, I mean, you can just Google it and find out and decide.
[108:37.47]Whatever.
[108:37.73]That's alright.
[108:39.31]Okay.
[108:54.18]Will I beat this shrine in 10 minutes?
[108:55.80]Starting...
[109:11.20]No.
[109:18.38]What's the ratio?
[109:27.06]Power of fire.
[109:28.12]Oh, shit.
[109:28.38]It's not a minor combat shrine.
[109:29.98]Uh-oh.
[109:30.28]Okay.
[109:30.60]Power of fire.
[109:31.38]That's easy.
[109:32.03]I don't have any arrows.
[109:58.58]Don't need arrows!
[110:23.11]I don't know why I thought that just said, let's go.
[110:24.90]Like, let's go.
[110:25.48]Alright.
[110:26.40]Now, uh, I got to knock that down with, I don't have any arrows.
[110:31.08]Shit.
[110:33.68]I'm good.
[110:49.31]Why is that here?
[110:55.80]Why is that?
[110:56.36]There's a little lip there.
[110:57.18]Why?
[110:57.44]Alright, so now I got, um... Okay.
[111:05.62]Alright.
[111:11.78]Okay.
[111:17.09]Can't knock this down?
[111:19.33]Shit.
[111:25.68]I got the, uh, treasure chest.
[111:31.58]Yep.
[111:36.14]Knight's bow.
[111:36.68]Alright, get rid of this fucking thing.
[111:54.05]83 to 17.
[111:54.81]Yes.
[111:55.99]My goodness.
[111:56.59]Alright.
[112:00.85]So I can't let you guys down.
[112:07.35]How am I going to break the ones higher, though?
[112:08.79]Isn't that impossible?
[112:20.27]If I don't have arrows, how can I shoot it?
[112:32.67]Oops.
[112:34.60]Alright, I'm gonna time it here.
[112:35.52]I'm gonna timer here.
[112:36.24]Hold on.
[112:36.52]I need to break this one.
[112:45.00]Excuse me?
[112:46.16]Wait, what?
[112:46.58]Uh-oh.
[112:52.37]Um, uh-oh.
[113:05.69]We're good.
[113:05.93]I got five minutes.
[113:19.70]Oh, I win.
[113:22.62]I got the chest too.
[113:23.33]That's everything.
[113:35.23]So that's all the shrines.
[113:36.21]Good.
[113:38.47]Very cool.
[113:38.99]Very cool.
[113:39.43]Very cool.
[113:45.34]Easiest points in my life.
[113:49.76]Yeah, I had some time to spare.
[113:50.71]I had at least four or five minutes to spare.
[114:03.73]How come you're only good when we bet?
[114:09.08]When I stop pretending.
[114:11.06]Alright, so now... Interesting.
[114:16.62]I got the shrines.
[114:19.90]I could... Over here, I guess, right?
[114:23.16]I guess I'm just gonna try to find a road and just go up this way?
[114:28.25]See what I find?
[114:32.51]No, you know what?
[114:33.13]Let's go back to the tower.
[114:34.53]Let me get a good bird's eye view of this whole place.
[114:45.42]Don't listen to the haters.
[115:08.62]Okay, so this is where I want to go is over here.
[115:14.67]I'm going to put a pin right here because I want to see how far away it is.
[115:20.31]I can't even see it anyways.
[115:21.33]Alright, so it's past the volcano.
[115:23.99]So the volcano is the next major thing that I have to do.
[115:28.35]So why don't I go over here that way and then up, wait, around the volcano?
[115:32.35]I'm going to go to that tower over there.
[115:38.24]Wait, what's that?
[115:38.94]There's something right here.
[115:44.06]And then I'm going to go here, and I'm going to go this way, and then bang a right over there, I guess.
[115:48.78]Okay, is this a... Oh, this is a... Ah, it's a stable.
[116:05.91]Cool.
[116:11.92]I'm a traveler.
[116:14.98]You must be a man who sets his mind on something and then gets it done.
[116:17.74]I'm the best.
[116:18.32]Okay.
[116:22.24]I was really into sword fighting, but I'm a bit of a rut with it.
[116:24.97]Doesn't help that the sword I'm using right now is way too blunt.
[116:28.53]That's why I thought, if I can get that legendary sword, maybe a new path will open for me.
[116:33.13]What do you think?
[116:35.92]Finally figured out that it's near Death Mountain.
[116:39.13]However, it doesn't seem to be in this direction.
[116:40.77]Maybe it's on the opposite side, closer to the Woodland Stable.
[116:44.05]Maybe I'll just mosey over to the Woodland Stable.
[117:19.33]What are you doing over there?
[117:20.03]What?
[117:20.59]Oh, wait.
[117:21.41]No.
[117:21.69]Highland stable?
[117:22.43]Where's The Woodlands?
[117:23.25]Oh, I haven't found it.
[117:23.95]Okay.
[117:26.41]Okay.
[117:27.71]Let's get Frank 2 over here.
[117:32.76]Gotta buy some stuff.
[117:34.60]Okay.
[117:42.72]Okay.
[117:51.79]Thank you.
[117:52.27]Okay.
[117:55.57]Let's get some... I actually think I have some food to make, don't I?
[118:04.01]Alright.
[118:05.21]Very hydrating liquid.
[118:07.53]Heat resistance.
[118:09.13]I mean, I'm going to the fire mountain right now.
[118:11.36]Let's do that.
[118:20.50]Heat resistance.
[118:21.56]Yep.
[118:38.69]Heat resistance.
[118:39.29]I mean, it means it's a volcano.
[118:40.95]Okay.
[118:46.47]Let's see what I get from this.
[118:53.63]Alright, six and a half minutes of low level heat resistance.
[118:55.81]Good.
[119:08.30]Cook individual radish.
[119:10.06]Wait.
[119:14.06]Movement speed.
[119:14.66]Alright.
[119:21.41]I'm going to do movement speed and radish.
[119:26.06]It's gonna be pretty sick, right?
[119:35.87]Why did that not work?
[119:36.43]How come that didn't work?
[119:46.72]Boost your movement speed when the seeds are cooked into a dish.
[119:49.16]What happened?
[119:52.69]Oh, goddammit.
[119:53.77]Alright, whatever.
[119:54.33]I forgot.
[119:55.85]I thought this was just yummy.
[120:03.86]Well, that was a waste, but whatever.
[120:11.86]Okay.
[120:15.56]Alright, what about an elixir?
[120:33.15]I don't think I have anything.
[120:36.93]Right?
[120:37.13]I don't think I have anything.
[120:37.83]Put wood in your food.
[120:52.86]Here we go.
[120:54.10]Alright, three and a half minutes of movement speed.
[120:57.44]Do it again.
[121:20.10]Dash assault.
[121:25.20]Okay.
[121:26.88]Good.
[121:28.50]Now... Do I have any, like, hot heat clothings?
[121:34.79]I don't think so.
[121:36.29]I'm gonna wear the heavy armor.
[121:37.15]I feel like it's better.
[121:42.59]For now.
[121:46.00]Alright.
[121:48.04]Hi.
[121:48.34]I love Frank, too.
[121:51.35]There's a general store around here.
[121:52.75]You have a store, right?
[121:54.95]No, I don't want that.
[122:05.38]Beetle?
[122:08.38]What's beetle?
[122:11.72]Oh, is this beetle?
[122:13.97]What's up?
[122:23.83]Okay.
[122:26.15]Thanks.
[122:28.73]A guardian in the eye.
[122:32.31]To find him, go way north past Zora's domain all the way to Akala Ancient Tech Lab.
[122:39.57]Alright, somebody remember that.
[122:40.31]Write that down.
[122:40.69]What do you got?
[122:50.72]Okay.
[122:51.08]Yep.
[122:51.42]Arrows times 10.
[122:54.41]Give that to me.
[122:56.09]How many of these do you have?
[122:58.61]What a waste of money.
[122:59.23]I'm not buying that.
[123:01.19]Ooh.
[123:03.21]Speed boost.
[123:05.42]Fire elixir.
[123:06.94]Let's go.
[123:07.40]Okay.
[123:15.43]You know what?
[123:15.99]Just buy it.
[123:16.39]Buy the whole store.
[123:17.37]Take the whole thing.
[123:19.45]That's a lot of money.
[123:20.67]Whoa, hold on a minute.
[123:23.49]That's a lot.
[123:24.21]That's too much money.
[123:27.80]Is that too much money or should I just buy it?
[123:29.32]Let's do it.
[123:33.16]Eh, fuck it, whatever.
[123:38.45]Speed boost.
[123:39.03]Yeah, I mean, I have a lot of materials to make elixirs.
[123:41.49]Let's do it.
[123:47.01]And because I'm a piece of shit, I'll, you know... How much is that?
[123:51.90]No, way too much.
[123:52.64]Alright, let's go make some heat elixirs.
[124:01.16]Wait, look what I got.
[124:01.96]I need some backseat Andes to help me.
[124:08.65]Should I just sell all these?
[124:13.35]Okay, if I keep selling all of my ore, I'm not going to have any ore to do anything in the rest of the game.
[124:25.36]Keep the luminous ones.
[124:28.76]Keep three of each.
[124:30.16]You barely need them.
[124:30.90]Keep, like, three of each.
[124:32.82]They're easy to get.
[124:33.40]Okay, well, I'll... Wars are used to upgrade armor at the... Oh, that's right.
[124:39.19]Um... I'll sell two of each.
[124:58.51]Okay, I'm not going to sell the luminous ones.
[125:00.17]What about these?
[125:03.70]260 bucks?
[125:05.84]Really?
[125:06.14]Is this bad if I sell?
[125:10.26]I don't think I use them in anything.
[125:11.76]Sell the gems?
[125:12.68]These are just money, right?
[125:21.67]That's a lot.
[125:22.15]Alright, now I actually have some cash.
[125:26.50]What's this thing?
[125:28.02]Oh, no.
[125:30.58]Alright.
[125:31.30]Now, I'm gonna make a bunch of, uh, elixirs.
[125:36.36]Goodbye.
[125:36.72]That's a pretty good Mario impression.
[125:43.71]Okay.
[125:44.27]So, if I do... Two... Lizards.
[125:50.09]If I go... Boom.
[125:51.82]Boom.
[125:52.64]Double heat lizard.
[125:54.28]And then...
[125:57.37]What's a rare ingredient?
[125:59.43]Just do one, not two?
[126:04.51]Just one?
[126:06.80]What's the highest quality monster part that I have?
[126:16.37]Does that matter?
[126:17.15]The guts?
[126:25.68]Does it actually matter?
[126:27.34]Oh, dude, what about the Lynel horn?
[126:30.68]This would be like an hour of heat resistance.
[126:40.37]No, no, no, don't do that.
[126:41.07]Keep these for later.
[126:42.19]Okay.
[126:43.87]What about the horn?
[126:44.83]These look like they're kind of high quality.
[126:48.06]Keep Lynel.
[126:48.70]Okay.
[126:50.46]Alright.
[126:52.44]Alright, let's go.
[126:52.88]Let's see what this does.
[127:01.59]Oh, high level fireproof effect, which prevents your body from catching fire.
[127:06.22]Be sure to pack this when venturing to explore the Death Mountain, which is where you're going.
[127:09.42]Okay, yes.
[127:10.40]Alright, 10 minutes.
[127:11.20]Let's do another one.
[127:26.09]Oh, that wasn't a good one.
[127:29.88]Why was that one worse?
[127:30.86]Alright, well, whatever.
[127:31.36]Why was that one worse?
[127:33.82]Alright, lizard.
[127:37.78]Temporary hearts.
[127:51.40]Oh, no guts.
[127:52.08]Okay.
[127:53.56]Oh, ooh.
[127:54.74]It's just a full heal?
[127:56.76]That's pretty sick.
[128:02.28]Oops.
[128:02.74]That's okay.
[128:03.32]Fuck.
[128:03.80]I just ruined everything.
[128:04.84]Should I reload the game?
[128:06.52]Where's my last save?
[128:10.83]1653?
[128:10.87]When was that?
[128:17.17]It's good?
[128:17.61]It's okay?
[128:18.13]No, no, no.
[128:18.51]It's fine.
[128:18.89]Alright.
[128:25.19]Okay.
[128:43.00]Alright, don't sell the Lionel Hoof.
[128:47.96]Hoof?
[128:48.66]Hoof?
[128:48.78]Why does that sound like I'm saying that word wrong?
[129:00.36]Hoof.
[129:02.54]Hoof.
[129:03.30]Hoof.
[129:07.50]Mid-level haste.
[129:08.28]Nice.
[129:19.81]You can't really softlock yourself.
[129:20.99]You'll find pretty much more of everything.
[129:22.51]Alright.
[129:40.97]Buy arrows.
[129:41.39]I already did.
[129:42.03]Alright.
[129:45.23]I'm ready to do Mount Doom.
[129:50.47]Where is it?
[129:52.57]I got tons of food.
[129:53.37]I'm ready.
[129:54.25]Look at all this.
[129:54.68]Look at it.
[129:54.96]I have more food.
[129:56.46]I'm a goddamn catering service.
[129:58.30]I got plenty of food.
[129:59.14]Let's go.
[130:03.30]Oh.
[130:23.66]Alright, Frank, let's go.
[130:32.61]So where do I want to go?
[130:38.07]I got to go this way.
[130:39.41]So I'm thinking maybe just wrap around.
[130:41.27]I don't know.
[130:42.75]Let's find out.
[130:48.43]I go down and then right.
[130:57.61]Let's see where I go.
[130:59.71]Oh my god, I just fucking ran that over.

[132:18.62]Wha- Hey!
[132:25.63]That's not gonna be on cooldown, right?
[132:27.19]Did I just get absolutely decimated there?
[132:30.64]What happened?
[132:32.02]I died twice.
[132:38.46]Okay, we're good.
[132:59.70]How do you miss that?
[133:00.56]It's so easy.
[133:04.54]I'm gonna scream.
[133:16.17]Oh my god.
[133:31.14]Oh my god, he overhand swung me in the head!
[133:35.05]Whatever that is, let me... Whatever that is, a huge sword just dropped.
[133:47.61]His big sword dropped.
[134:07.08]Hell yeah.
[134:08.34]Alright, who's left?
[134:09.72]Nice.
[134:10.02]Very good.
[134:17.37]No more melee weapons, excuse me.
[134:23.85]Ooh, those guts are worth a lot, right?
[134:30.16]There was a huge sword that dropped over here.
[134:31.86]What is that?
[134:36.26]Knight's Claymore.
[134:37.42]Ooh, yup.
[134:38.78]Okay, what should I get rid of?
[134:39.62]I feel like this thing's cool, but should I just get rid of it?
[134:50.15]It's cool.
[134:53.64]It's good.
[134:55.34]Just take a picture of it.
[134:57.16]Oh, hold on.
[134:57.74]You're right.
[134:58.40]Good idea.
[135:07.38]Okay.
[135:09.68]Ice rod.
[135:10.12]Okay.
[135:18.39]Alright.
[135:21.01]Oh, damn.
[135:21.44]This thing's cool looking.
[135:23.30]Ooh, alright.
[135:26.80]I think I'm good.
[135:28.56]I don't have any more room.
[135:33.67]Keep the rod.
[135:35.33]Stop it.
[135:36.09]What?
[135:37.45]What should I get rid of?
[135:40.41]Get away?
[135:40.65]Throw the 12 spear away?
[135:43.07]But look at it.
[135:43.87]It's shining.
[135:47.07]This thing's got to go.
[135:48.09]Didn't I?
[135:48.47]This was in a chest.
[135:51.14]One of the guardian swords.
[135:54.76]I like it.
[136:10.65]I like that.
[136:12.79]What are you doing?
[136:13.73]Alright, I'm getting... People are doing the... Okay, whatever.
[136:18.85]Drop the spear.
[136:19.56]It's blue!
[136:20.24]It's my favorite color.
[136:20.96]I'm not dropping it.
[136:42.07]I replaced the five bomb arrows I shot into nothing.
[136:44.81]OK, here we go.
[136:50.20]We're gonna just keep going up the road, right?
[136:59.12]Yep.
[137:00.14]A is not there.
[137:06.95]Need some more seeds.
[137:08.07]Yeah, I need some more seeds to upgrade the inventory.
[137:16.19]I forgot to blink.
[137:19.79]Alright, so I'm going to keep going this way.
[137:21.43]Hopefully this eventually leads to the mountain.
[137:23.53]I feel like I'm going away from the mountain.
[137:49.91]Let go of the stick.
[137:51.29]Trust me.
[137:54.13]Huh?
[138:04.76]Are you serious?
[138:11.50]The horse will steer itself.
[138:15.76]Why would I have ever thought that was a thing?
[138:19.60]Are you serious?
[138:23.52]Wait, what's over here?
[138:26.98]Yep.
[138:28.86]Stay right there.
[138:48.43]Stop.
[138:55.72]Red choo-choo jelly.
[138:56.82]Cool.
[139:08.33]I do that strategy, man.
[139:09.25]It doesn't work.
[139:09.75]Okay.
[139:25.91]It's my first stream here.
[139:29.61]Have fun playing this.
[139:30.52]It's the first game I ever bought.
[139:31.52]Is that what you said?
[139:33.54]I hope so.
[139:36.66]Yeah.
[139:38.36]That's great.
[139:39.68]It's really, really fun.
[139:42.54]Okay.
[139:49.70]What's in the chest?
[139:58.41]It's a hundred bucks, I'll take it.
[139:59.31]I mean, I'm not gonna say no to a hundred dollars, right?
[140:05.91]Cool.
[140:09.14]What else is down here?
[140:09.80]Huh?
[140:12.48]Something weird down here?
[140:13.56]Some weird shit down here?
[140:14.42]I'm getting the, uh... The ding ding.
[140:25.41]I'm getting dings here.
[140:34.87]Do the new viewer song?
[140:37.49]Um... I can't do the new viewer song anymore.
[140:49.63]Oh, it didn't hit!
[140:50.47]It hit somebody in there!
[140:51.69]Oh my god, that's so frustrating.
[140:53.91]I'm in trouble now.
[140:59.88]I can't do the new viewer song anymore.
[141:04.27]Come on.
[141:09.81]Oh my god, get out of here.
[141:29.07]You got a big sword.
[141:29.97]Where's he going?
[141:37.26]Stop!
[141:48.41]Stop swinging!
[141:53.54]I cannot even hurt these guys.
[142:08.84]What the fuck?
[142:09.38]Can I get it?
[142:12.16]No.
[142:45.84]I don't wanna eat any of this food.
[142:56.12]You know what I mean?
[142:56.54]I don't want to eat any of the food.
[143:07.52]It all seems too important.
[143:08.68]I don't want to eat this.
[143:09.37]I'll eat this.
[143:25.00]Okay.
[143:28.12]Alright.
[143:30.98]Well, that could have gone way better.
[143:32.26]That was a good shot.
[143:47.00]Okay.
[143:59.04]Very good.
[143:59.66]Alright, cool.
[144:00.24]Now let's do it.
[144:01.52]My god.
[144:03.00]My goodness.
[144:06.19]The big sword dropped?
[144:06.95]Yeah, I'll go get it.
[144:12.35]Where did that guy die?
[144:13.01]Ah, alright.
[144:21.72]Couple crusher.
[144:26.79]I think it kind of sucks.
[144:29.37]This thing's almost broken though, so whatever.
[144:30.79]Fuck it.
[144:33.37]I'll use it.
[144:41.21]What's in the chest?
[144:45.76]Oh, it can be used as a pickaxe.
[144:48.64]Really?
[144:50.54]Oh, hell yeah.
[144:52.52]Alright.
[144:53.44]Remind me not to use this for anything.
[144:55.74]Besides this.
[145:06.70]Very cool.
[145:13.87]So where should I... Give it to me.
[145:22.21]Why are you so short?
[145:23.81]It's because when God made me, he was like, nah, this guy's way too powerful.
[145:30.08]He'd be far too powerful if he was like 6'1".
[145:33.46]Gotta make him 5'7".
[145:34.72]Otherwise, it'd be like, you know, how can you stop this person?
[145:37.88]Unbeatable.
[145:38.32]Unstoppable.
[145:40.37]You know, whatever.
[145:41.35]It's alright.
[145:43.87]What was in here?
[145:44.41]I wasn't paying attention.
[145:49.15]That's okay.
[145:49.45]Okay.
[145:57.40]People said not to get rid of the frantic bow.
[146:08.45]Oh, this thing's kind of dumpy, right?
[146:10.13]Okay.
[146:20.00]Now I've got to find this shrine, wherever it is.
[146:26.49]Five fire arrows.
[146:27.47]Alright, I'll take it.
[146:30.57]That's ten fire arrows.
[146:31.63]Alright, nice.
[146:41.11]It's the only ball that zooms in when you use it.
[146:44.05]Ah.
[146:48.07]I think it's in here.
[147:15.96]Did it.
[147:20.64]Oh, nice.
[147:21.04]Got four of them now.
[147:36.26]You can do that better.
[147:37.28]I probably could, but I don't really feel like it.
[147:45.77]Where's Frank?
[147:46.75]Oh, he's up there.
[147:59.40]It's definitely in here.
[148:00.30]It has to be, right?
[148:00.88]Yeah, it's right there.
[148:15.30]Alright, are we just not doing a vote here?
[148:18.10]Probably not.
[148:19.06]I don't think we're going to do it every time, do we?
[148:24.64]Do you want to bet?
[148:26.91]You guys do?
[148:28.55]Why not?
[148:29.05]Alright.
[148:30.43]10 minutes.
[148:30.67]10 minutes including chest.
[148:37.36]Fine.
[148:37.60]10 minutes including chest.
[148:40.80]From the moment that I skip and I'm able to move.
[148:47.59]Five.
[148:48.31]Five.
[148:48.77]Seven.
[148:50.49]Alright.
[148:51.59]Seven minutes including chest.
[148:53.77]I'm gonna put my headphones in and just shut the fuck up and do it as best as I can.
[149:00.48]Seven minutes including the chest.
[149:07.18]What do you think?
[149:12.58]Is that a good time?
[149:17.22]Make it six.
[149:17.76]No, it's seven.
[149:18.38]Seven minutes.
[149:20.78]Oh, I can do it.
[149:21.20]Hold on.
[149:21.38]I can run it.
[149:22.88]Alright.
[149:23.98]No, why am I running a poll?
[149:25.70]How do I do it?
[149:27.52]How do you do a prediction?
[149:28.72]Slash prediction?
[149:30.54]I actually don't know how to do it.
[149:32.80]I did it once.
[149:33.34]Slash prediction.
[149:35.32]Oh, okay.
[149:35.74]You're doing it.
[149:36.06]Alright.
[149:38.34]I've actually only done it one time.
[149:39.58]Ah, there we go.
[149:41.85]Okay.
[149:41.95]Okay.
[149:47.03]Somebody said they're going all in.
[149:47.99]Uh-oh.
[150:01.88]I'd be betting if I were you.
[150:08.27]Lock it in.
[150:11.71]Locked in?
[150:15.25]Locked in.
[150:15.81]That was fast.
[150:16.97]You got to be fast.
[150:18.09]Locked in.
[150:18.65]Let's go.
[150:29.71]I was too slow.
[150:30.67]Here we go.
[150:33.43]Alright.
[150:34.09]It starts.
[150:34.95]Not right.
[150:35.39]Hold on.
[150:38.05]Not yet.
[150:41.41]Not yet.
[150:45.50]Time begins now.
[151:48.87]No, it's... I got it.
[151:51.61]I got it!
[152:39.09]I got this.
[152:39.87]There's like five chests in here.
[152:49.75]Hmm.
[153:13.76]Oh!
[153:13.98]Burn it!
[153:14.38]Burn it!
[153:14.74]Burn it!

[153:17.76]Burn it!
[153:29.99]How do I get in there?
[153:30.53]I need a key to get in there.
[153:33.15]Where's the key?
[153:34.77]Where's the key?
[153:47.28]Where's the key?
[153:47.86]I need a key to get in here.

[155:49.45]They showed you it was a magnet.
[155:56.36]No?
[155:56.74]That's not accurate.
[155:58.02]I thought about that.
[155:59.04]It's not rigged.
[156:10.05]Alright, cool.

[168:28.96]There's nothing better than the generic rock song.
[168:47.55]I love the generic rock song.
[168:51.15]And usually it's on the piano.
[168:53.23]A regular piano, not a keyboard.
[168:55.19]They're like... Aren't you 40?
[168:56.98]No, not yet, but soon.
[168:57.56]I don't know what you want me to say.
[168:59.16]Alright, let's go.
[169:22.28]Should I get the tower?
[169:25.93]Wait.
[169:26.91]That's a weird rock.
[169:31.39]Never mind.
[169:33.17]Trying.
[169:44.34]Where's it at?
[169:44.98]Oh my god.
[169:45.56]Don't scare me like that.
[169:49.47]I know I did the Red Dead joke already, but I want to just look at him and go... Oh, you're ugly.
[169:55.32]Hey!
[169:56.60]I'm just kidding, really.
[169:57.48]You know, you look like a dumb son of a gun.
[170:05.18]I'm just playing around with you.
[170:07.88]Why are you being so serious?
[170:11.89]I do it every time.
[170:13.09]Wait, what's that?
[170:17.31]A stick!
[170:29.09]You don't like the water, do you?
[170:30.07]Alright, you're good.
[170:31.61]Very nice job.
[170:32.47]You're... Look out!
[170:33.67]I thought he was gonna get hit right in the head.
[170:55.58]Is he gonna drown?
[170:56.32]No, he's not.
[170:58.20]He's fine.
[171:00.88]He's not being attacked by a wild animal, right?
[171:10.11]No, Frank's fine.
[171:14.82]There's a weirdo over there, though.
[171:16.34]I'm kind of concerned about that.
[171:30.29]Alright, he's fine.
[171:34.49]Ooh, there's a stable.
[171:35.25]Cool.
[171:40.11]Alright, place your bets.
[171:41.55]Seven minutes to get the chest as well.
[171:44.79]I mean, I can't win every time, right?
[171:53.84]Wait, what is that?
[172:11.00]Point at this.
[172:21.27]What does it do?
[172:33.06]What should I do with it?
[172:49.76]Weird.
[172:55.08]What purpose?
[172:56.38]What is the charge?
[172:58.06]I don't know.
[173:14.44]Does it matter?
[173:14.92]Do I have to do anything with this?
[173:17.46]I don't get it.
[173:19.33]I don't get it, I'll come back later.
[173:26.66]It's alright, I'll come back later.
[173:27.68]Alright, are we betting or what?
[173:34.32]Seven minutes and the chest?
[173:38.48]That's locked in?
[173:39.34]Alright.

[173:41.90]Seven minutes with the chest.
[173:45.59]That's a locked in.
[173:48.29]Let's go.

[177:39.23]I know what to do!
[177:39.71]Alright, that would have killed me.
[177:41.11]I would have just died.
[177:41.81]I thought you had to ride on it.
[177:42.91]I thought you had to ride on top of it.
[177:44.22]Okay, we're good.
[177:50.02]Oops, I just... Ow, my fingernail.
[177:52.04]Okay, I win!
[178:00.16]Imagine if I wrote on top of that and it just got splattered against the wall.
[178:02.90]That actually would have been really funny.
[178:06.58]You didn't get the chest?
[178:07.30]What do you mean?
[178:07.68]What?
[178:07.86]What?

[178:23.71]So I gotta go back in.
[178:24.53]Where is it?
[178:25.19]Don't tell me.
[178:25.59]Okay, hold on.
[178:28.29]I'll get it.
[178:30.01]I got four minutes?
[178:31.84]Three minutes?
[178:35.36]Alright, speedrun strategy loading screens don't count.
[178:38.30]Right?
[178:38.68]They like, speedruns pause.
[178:40.30]The timer pauses.
[178:43.07]Until you get control of the character back, right?
[178:50.95]There's a chest in here that I didn't get?
[179:34.95]Where did that go?
[179:39.87]Are you fucking kidding me?
[179:57.34]Oh good.
[179:57.80]Fast!
[179:58.30]That was fast.
[179:58.92]That was super.
[179:59.52]That was fast as fuck.
[180:00.38]Alright.
[180:03.71]Where's the chest?
[180:04.17]Where is it?
[180:07.91]Where's the chest?
[180:15.09]Where's the chest?
[180:20.48]Where's the chest?
[180:22.52]I don't see anything.
[180:23.26]I don't see a chest anywhere.
[180:48.53]Huh?
[181:40.90]I don't know where it is.
[181:41.80]This shit's hidden in a fucking wall somewhere.
[181:55.04]I don't know.
[181:55.40]I don't understand.
[182:00.29]Is that one there?
[182:01.35]Then... Wait a minute.
[182:09.18]What if I do this?
[182:09.66]Hold on.
[182:10.06]I got an idea.
[182:11.96]It's probably inside.
[182:13.02]It's inside of this.
[182:18.39]Is it?
[182:18.61]I don't know.
[182:18.95]Is it inside?
[182:20.09]It's inside of this thing.
[182:20.79]I have to smash it against the wall.
[182:25.54]It's inside.
[182:35.07]It's over, I lose.
[182:36.26]Where is it?
[182:42.44]Where is this chest that's apparently here somewhere?
[182:45.72]Magnet, magnet.
[182:46.40]Yeah, but magnet what?
[182:52.80]Magnet?
[182:54.20]I don't see anything here.
[183:00.15]Hold on.
[183:00.89]Wait.
[183:01.43]Can I have... Can I hit... Wait a minute.
[183:10.94]This is going to move now.
[183:11.94]Oh, okay.
[183:15.84]Then you move it down and that unlocks the next thing.
[183:35.63]Wait, what?
[183:39.81]What is it?
[183:40.39]Where's this?
[183:51.42]Oh, I got it.
[183:56.89]Alright, let him out.
[184:20.34]No, why?
[184:21.12]Look at the direction I'm facing.
[184:22.24]Why would it do that?
[184:36.87]Dude.
[184:42.59]No, you idiot.
[184:44.17]You idiot!
[184:59.20]Hey!
[185:26.06]Oh my god, I gotta- it's gonna be faster than that.
[185:28.32]This thing's gonna break.
[185:40.97]Oh my god.
[185:41.69]AH!
[186:15.81]Oh my god, it's so close.
[186:23.15]It's the one right below the maximum.
[186:39.02]This thing's gonna break.
[186:46.91]And then I'll be left with n-nothing!
[186:48.57]Okay.
[187:39.38]Oh, what the fuck?
[187:40.82]How many times?
[187:41.52]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[187:48.76]Five times?
[188:50.31]Shoot it with an arrow?
[189:01.81]Stupid asshole.
[189:02.73]Oh my god.
[189:33.38]Oh my god, just look forward.
[189:34.58]Alright, here we go, ready?
[190:12.35]What the fuck?!
[190:21.58]I'm gonna break all my weapons, man.
[190:23.66]All my weapons are gonna break!
[190:39.57]I'm gonna break every weapon.
[190:51.15]Hold Y?
[190:51.67]Yeah, when I hold Y I do this like barbarian spin and I can't get the right angle.
[191:06.67]Dude, hold.
[191:07.45]Why?
[191:08.25]What are you talking about, man?
[191:17.00]Stand still?
[191:17.58]You can't stand still.
[191:18.76]Look.
[191:22.32]Oh, you can stand still.
[191:23.18]You can stand still.
[191:23.88]Alright.
[191:24.26]Time that person up for an hour.
[191:25.02]I don't want to be looked.
[191:27.01]I don't want to time that person up for five minutes.
[191:42.29]I don't, I don't, I don't get it.
[191:48.47]How many, how many hits should I do with the spin?
[192:01.25]Seven?
[192:02.73]Seven.
[192:03.57]Do all of them.
[192:16.81]I'm out of, uh, weapons.
[192:18.19]I don't want to- I don't want to break my weapons.
[192:21.92]Everything's- I broke another one.
[192:23.26]Um.
[192:29.80]Oh, yes!
[192:31.58]This better be good.
[192:44.29]Oh.
[192:53.96]I thought I was going to get like a light sword, like a lightsaber, like a light sword.
[192:57.48]What the fuck?
[192:58.14]That was, was that worth, not even worth it.
[193:11.22]It is good.
[193:11.82]Those are rare.
[193:12.32]Oh, okay.
[193:13.60]Well, that was fun.
[193:19.13]That's actually a good item.
[193:33.86]Giant Ancient Core Pog.
[193:35.94]Okay.
[193:37.22]If it actually is worth it, then that's cool.
[193:38.98]Just warp to the shrine.
[193:54.18]Teleport.
[193:54.89]Oh, I can just leave.
[193:56.49]Where is he going?
[194:13.75]Why does he look like this?
[194:16.13]Why do people ask that every day?
[194:17.47]People ask that question every single day.
[194:31.93]Hey, why does he look like this, man?
[194:33.49]I don't know.
[194:34.11]Why do you look like you?
[194:36.07]Why do you look like that?
[194:51.20]Okay, so let's get back on the road.
[194:55.26]I'll figure that puzzle out later.
[194:56.42]I have my elephant recovery.
[195:11.21]Do that now.
[195:12.07]Do the puzzle now.
[195:13.03]I don't even know what to do.
[195:14.21]How can I do a puzzle now?
[195:18.57]Oh, okay.
[195:19.09]I'm good.
[195:22.10]I can't.
[195:22.36]How am I supposed to do it now?
[195:23.74]Figure it out.
[195:24.28]I don't know what it wants me to do.
[195:25.60]Do what now?
[195:28.86]Alright, fine.
[195:29.56]I'll do it now.
[195:37.72]Nice tuber reaction.
[195:40.64]figure it.
[195:41.10]I'm going to drown because somebody was calling me a name in chat and I looked at it.
[195:46.05]Alright.
[195:47.73]I have stamina, right?
[195:50.07]I just don't want to drown.
[195:55.70]I don't think I have any stamina food.
[195:57.90]I think I'm thinking it's over.
[195:59.46]It's over.
[196:00.86]I'm going to drown here.
[196:11.14]Alright, so what do you want me to do now?
[196:21.71]So this is a puzzle.
[196:22.73]Figure it out, it's a puzzle.
[196:29.05]I mean, I think I understand what it wants me to do.
[196:31.74]Alright, let's see if it's as simple as I think it is.
[196:45.79]I'd like a better camera angle, please.
[197:19.49]You don't just connect it.
[197:20.71]I figured it was like 1, 2, 3, 4, right?
[197:22.65]You connect it, connect them all.
[197:26.68]That has to be what you do.
[197:28.58]What the hell is with this before?
[197:29.52]Can I push it?
[197:41.62]Okay, that's not what you do, so I guess it's a little more complicated.
[197:48.42]Are there any instructions on it?
[198:01.53]Yes, I know it's a magnet.
[198:05.07]I understand it's a magnet.
[198:07.35]Yes, I currently am using a magnet.
[198:39.17]I put it through it.
[198:39.93]It didn't work.
[198:41.07]I did a field goal and it didn't work.
[198:47.79]What even is that emote?
[198:48.63]I don't even know what that is.
[198:56.50]Do I have to swim through it?
[199:12.08]Wait, there's another one over here.
[200:27.73]Was it a typewriter?
[200:29.15]What is that?
[200:29.55]What email is that?
[200:30.15]What email is this?
[200:33.95]Copy this.
[200:35.11]Copy this.
[200:35.67]Copy this.
[200:36.73]I don't know what I copy.
[200:37.59]Like I have to copy it?
[200:48.03]Copy this.
[200:48.49]Copy this.
[200:48.87]I don't know how do I copy it?
[200:50.45]There's no such thing as copy.
[201:04.23]Should we free them?
[201:05.31]Um... Yeah, let them out.
[201:09.21]Let them out.
[201:09.67]I don't know.
[201:10.21]I can't do it.
[201:10.71]I don't understand it.
[201:12.43]I don't get it.
[201:14.57]Copy this.
[201:17.71]It's a really good hint.
[201:19.21]Copy.
[201:19.75]Copy.
[201:26.28]Copy this.
[201:33.38]I have to match the other one but the other one already is looks like that where did it go yeah the one the one already oh wait a minute oh wait hold on oh okay oh okay uh-huh
[201:59.35]I dropped that fucking cube on the ground 30 times over here and it didn't land in that spot.
[202:19.16]I desperately tried to put it down like five times.
[202:22.98]You're stupid.
[202:24.34]Yeah?
[202:27.02]Oh, you've got to copy the one under there.
[202:30.11]How would you know that?
[202:31.03]You didn't know that.
[202:32.65]You went to... You went to... You went to the extra life dot Breath of the Wild dot whatever.
[202:44.31]And you had to look it up.
[202:54.40]This is the single most infuriating thing I've ever watched in my entire life.
[202:57.24]How is Jerma a functioning human?
[202:58.54]Because I didn't see the puzzle underground?
[203:17.59]Okay, if a live streamer not doing a puzzle correct...
[203:22.60]is the most worst thing you've ever seen in your life?
[203:29.41]Whoa.
[203:31.51]Whoa.
[203:36.47]That's the worst thing ever you've ever seen?
[203:38.23]Holy shit.
[203:43.80]It started raining!
[203:44.74]It's raining and I can't see shit!
[203:53.36]That's the thing I've ever seen.
[204:00.58]You didn't know how to take the cube from that place and put it where the cube goes?
[204:06.83]How do you put your pants on every day?
[204:08.83]It's impossible.
[204:09.65]You know what?
[204:10.11]Look, they're on.
[204:11.03]They're on and they're tied correctly.
[204:12.47]I know how to tie my shoes too.
[204:27.25]To be fair, they didn't have 21,000 chat chimpanzees throwing coffee machines at them.
[204:41.95]Alright.
[204:46.01]So let me upgrade my gear.
[204:59.52]Alright, uh, shields.
[205:02.40]Definitely shields.
[205:13.04]I don't know how to tie my pants.
[205:16.06]It's not hard.
[205:34.98]Hmm, again?
[205:35.60]I think again.
[205:40.56]Two shields.
[205:49.72]Weapon is three or four.
[205:57.31]Hey, Jerma.
[205:57.65]If you're getting stressed by these comments, it's a cigarette joke.
[205:59.67]Never mind.
[206:00.73]Alright, what do we got?
[206:01.99]We keep going.
[206:08.51]Uh, weapon is three or four.
[206:09.87]Okay, I'm gonna save it because I want to do weapon again.
[206:12.59]Or should I do bow?
[206:33.66]We love you, Jerma.
[206:34.32]We have to guide you to victory.
[206:39.10]I'm gonna figure it out.
[206:42.02]Give me a minute.
[206:49.28]Okay.
[207:04.21]Follow the route.
[207:10.83]take it slow alright okay for every for every one person that says enjoy the game and take it slow don't rush just take it at your pace to the it's like a one-to-one to how did he not finish this puzzle in 10 seconds
[207:39.18]Push him to his limits.
[207:50.38]I don't mind you struggling with a toddler puzzle as long as you can prove you can dodge a battle axe.
[207:55.28]I just fucked that guy up!
[207:57.66]How was that, huh?
[208:00.50]How's that for a gamer?
[208:05.58]Put that in your textbook and go learn.
[208:13.21]Alright, where am I going?
[208:14.25]Wrong way.
[208:32.64]It's weird that all the CEOs of major cigarette companies hang out in Twitch chats all day.
[208:41.02]That's so stupid.
[208:45.42]Is the road split?
[208:53.05]Should I go this way?
[208:56.39]Bad marketing.
[209:01.47]Just imagine like a cigarette company CEO just sitting there just... Like a tank top and his underwear just lying in bed just like... Hey, you should um... Have you ever smoked a cigarette?
[209:24.31]cigarette comedians I'm just I don't know um tower tower tower alright I'm ready this is gonna be sick

[209:52.24]Yeah, because I was wicked high.
[209:53.62]Okay?
[209:54.04]I'm sorry.
[209:57.16]What?
[209:57.98]Well, you can't... You can't... What, you want me to defend every bonehead move in a game I've done?
[210:02.94]I happen to be a little bit on the... I was a little bit high at the time.
[210:13.43]I wasn't even trying to target that guy.
[210:15.09]Don't die!
[210:45.22]Holy shit, this weapon is amazing.
[210:46.38]I don't want to break it.
[210:51.12]I will dodge a fucking axe in real life.
[210:53.00]I swear to god.
[210:54.56]I will contact some martial artist group and go into a martial artist studio and fucking dodge a bunch of weapons on stream.
[211:02.17]I swear to god.
[211:02.71]I will do a... This is what would happen if I was attacked by an axe stream.
[211:23.16]wow oh no that's not that don't do not spoil what the joke would be though come on don't do that don't spoil the joke don't spoil do not spoil the joke hold on I'm biting my lip don't spoil the joke please

[211:56.48]Just wait.
[211:57.00]Just wait.
[212:01.52]Okay, I'm going to do this soon.
[212:02.34]I'm going to do this really soon.
[212:09.55]This is not going to take that much time to do, so I'm going to do it very soon.
[212:15.66]Was there a chest?
[212:28.98]This stream is going to be funny.
[212:30.92]No spoilers.
[212:31.48]I'm going to try to do this this month.
[212:34.76]It's not going to take a whole lot of time to get ready.
[212:41.95]Bro, the tower.
[212:44.37]Alright, yeah.
[213:08.08]Why did I think that it ended right there?
[213:11.78]All I saw was this and I thought it was the clip.
[213:15.36]Red sky?
[213:15.92]I'll be fine.
[213:25.75]And the title of that stream is going to literally be... The Dodge the Battle Axe stream.
[213:31.21]Okay?
[213:34.13]I don't... It doesn't need a fancy title.
[213:37.54]I don't even need to sponsor that stream.
[213:39.92]I don't have to do that.
[213:42.16]I mean, maybe.
[213:42.94]It'd be kind of funny.
[213:45.22]I don't know.
[213:45.52]I'm into this now.
[213:46.38]I swear to God, I'm going to make it.
[213:48.24]I'm going to scheme.
[213:49.52]It's going to be such a fucking scheme.
[213:50.94]I can't wait.
[213:51.78]Alright, that's literally... I'm not going to say anything else.
[214:09.16]Just wait, because the Blood Moon is going to happen, right?
[214:11.98]And they're going to respawn anyways.
[214:13.08]They're going to respawn anyways.
[214:24.11]Just whatever.
[214:34.85]I'll tell the mods.
[214:36.46]Blood moon rises once again.
[214:42.63]Please be careful.
[215:01.28]I was typing.
[215:02.40]I was typing to the whatever.
[215:07.87]Okay, I just... What?
[215:14.64]What just happened?
[215:15.46]Is it... I'm very confused.
[215:19.36]Why is it raining meteors?
[215:25.70]Is this water boiling?
[215:26.82]Who is doing this?
[215:37.19]Okay, where?
[215:38.09]This guy's annoying.
[215:40.77]This guy's really annoying.
[215:42.03]This guy's fucking annoying.
[215:43.81]Okay, hold on.
[216:00.24]Dude, can you be in a spot where I can actually fucking hit you with a weapon?
[216:03.94]Oh my god.
[216:13.58]Give me that thing.
[216:20.60]Get the fuck away from me.
[216:25.43]Ooh.

[217:39.79]Goodbye.
[217:40.75]See you later.
[217:41.25]Hmm.
[217:58.65]Would ice actually work here?
[217:59.77]Oh, this is technically water.
[218:02.88]Okay.
[218:04.28]I thought it was sludge or something.
[218:52.21]I don't think I can make this jump.
[218:58.60]Don't you dare.
[219:26.13]Oh my god, I panicked so much from that guy shooting at me.
[219:33.89]Dude.
[219:39.24]I'm going to just electrify the fucking whole thing.
[219:52.89]Just get out of here.
[219:55.49]Little shithead.
[219:57.81]No, don't, don't.
[219:58.78]If you fire at me, I will be very upset.
[220:00.52]Don't even think about it.
[220:01.22]Okay.
[220:20.77]Now I can do this in peace.
[220:41.18]Chest over there.
[220:41.70]Jimba, the cigarette CEOs are winning.
[220:53.21]Don't let them win.
[220:55.63]Every time you see somebody write about a cigarette in the chat, I want you to write... Extra lettuce or something.
[221:01.45]No.
[221:01.71]What's like a healthy thing?
[221:02.96]I don't know.
[221:03.90]Exercise regularly.
[221:05.42]Yeah.
[221:14.05]Alright, so... I need to go over that way.
[221:18.55]Is there anything else over here?
[221:20.69]What's that for?
[221:21.19]Gotta be a reason, right?
[221:29.09]Why is this here?
[221:29.53]This is a weird thing to just be sitting right here.
[221:36.04]Ooh!
[221:37.72]I'll take that.
[221:46.99]Good.
[221:50.65]Sleeping?
[221:54.13]Okay.
[222:03.81]This thing's broken anyway, so just drop it.
[222:15.52]What?
[222:17.11]Wasn't it a Knight's bow in there?
[222:18.13]OK, I'm going to head back there.
[222:32.76]Can I even break this though?
[222:33.72]Oh wait, I have bombs.
[222:44.16]Hell yeah.
[222:50.25]Power time.
[223:21.48]Woodland power.
[223:25.14]Okay.
[223:26.20]Can I just climb it?
[223:27.20]I think so, right?
[223:30.80]Find out.
[223:47.83]Something up there, too.
[224:05.56]I can't wait for this stream.
[224:06.80]It's all I can think about right now.
[224:25.56]Am I gonna make it?
[224:27.22]I don't think so.
[224:31.14]Dude, I...
[224:32.78]What?! !
[224:35.47]That's impossible.
[224:38.07]I fell in the pixel perfect place to die.
[224:40.60]This has got to be a different... Hold on.
[224:49.50]Do I have to just climb this?
[224:58.93]I don't think I can even make it.
[225:00.45]I don't have stamina.
[225:04.69]Wait, did you drink a climb potion?
[225:11.67]You wouldn't have been able to do that if you tried to do that.
[225:14.79]You genuinely would not have been able to do what I just did if you tried to.
[225:18.01]Like a hundred times, over and over again.
[225:21.20]Honest to God, I don't think you'd be able to do that.
[225:35.38]You can't throw shit, right?
[225:39.10]You can.
[225:45.26]What?
[225:45.52]I thought the rock... I thought the rock boomeranged and hit me.
[225:49.40]I thought the rock boomeranged and hit me.
[225:53.20]It's you.
[225:54.10]Oh my god.
[225:54.86]Get... No!
[225:59.16]Oh my god.

[234:12.05]What?
[234:12.47]The chair?
[234:14.43]I don't understand.

[234:41.75]There's some shrines probably out here.
[234:43.01]I don't see any shrines, actually.
[234:54.76]Wow.
[234:58.06]Hello?
[234:58.34]Are we good?
[234:59.40]I hope so.
[235:12.33]I don't see anything.
[235:16.49]I don't think there's any shrines that way.
[235:18.03]Go back here.
[235:21.90]Hard to tell.
[235:24.96]Okay.
[235:26.90]Cool.
[235:30.22]I can go up that way.
[235:31.36]Can I get up there that way?
[235:35.36]Fuck it.
[235:35.60]Let's go.
[235:49.00]Climb up.
[235:49.62]Come on.
[235:51.62]Climb the skull.
[235:54.41]Climb the skull.
[235:55.23]Climb the skull.
[235:57.59]I missed it.
[235:57.89]I just want to see what's over here.
[236:07.60]I can always teleport.
[236:22.43]Oh wow, that's cool.
[236:24.43]Go to the woods?
[236:25.23]I will.
[236:25.47]I just want to see what's over here.
[236:33.68]Stop rushing me in my playthrough.
[236:37.02]Jerma, you're not doing puzzles fast enough.
[236:38.46]Jerma, climb the skull.
[236:42.40]This is my playthrough.
[236:47.02]I'm going to go where I want to go.
[236:57.43]Ooh.
[236:59.47]You got your playthrough.
[237:00.83]I get my... It's my playthrough.
[237:07.85]And I want macaroni and cheese for dinner.
[237:15.05]And an egg.
[237:16.72]Just one.
[237:17.96]Cooked.
[237:21.20]No, I want McDonald's.
[237:29.95]My playthrough.
[237:33.27]I get to decide what food I have, too.
[237:34.51]You need a baby.
[237:50.22]Spoiled.
[237:54.18]Ow!
[237:54.98]What happened?
[237:58.95]Oh, it's heat.
[238:03.74]Come on, put it out.
[238:06.84]Okay, so this is made out of wood, so get rid of it.
[238:13.09]Ooh.
[238:18.37]Go fight already.
[238:19.15]Am I just gonna get burned if I walk over here, though?
[238:24.01]Does this hurt?
[238:29.30]Okay, the air hurts.
[238:30.41]So hold on.
[238:31.05]I specifically made food for this.
[238:33.27]Exact purpose.
[238:34.85]Hold on, my brain's itching.
[238:37.77]Okay.
[238:40.57]So this is 10 minutes of fireproof.
[238:55.68]Is this a good idea?
[238:59.55]Yeah.
[239:02.44]You can swim in the lava.
[239:04.30]Yeah, alright.
[239:15.30]What else is on fire?
[239:17.82]Something's burning.
[239:20.88]Oh, it's me!
[239:23.26]Oh, yikes!
[239:24.16]It's me!
[239:24.88]Right?
[239:25.22]Come on.
[239:25.96]I've seen this episode a million times.
[239:29.02]Um, how do I?
[239:29.78]Does it matter?
[239:31.58]I was gonna try to get over there, whatever.
[239:37.89]Ooh, crunchies.
[239:59.87]Put the bow away.
[240:01.51]I... Switch the bow.
[240:03.31]What?
[240:15.18]Ice rod.
[240:18.14]Now I'm decked out.
[240:19.23]Okay.
[240:20.17]I'm here.
[240:20.65]Cool.
[240:23.05]Should I grab anything?
[240:29.28]I think I have to just get up here, right?
[240:33.05]You're in the volcano, for fuck's sake.
[240:34.59]I know.
[240:35.35]Dude, I'm trying to figure out how to get in here.
[240:38.49]I'm on a time limit.
[240:39.27]I can't really stick around.
[240:40.13]Yeah.
[240:44.74]What's that?
[240:46.20]Water.
[240:46.46]I hear water.
[240:50.64]Oh, lord.
[240:51.32]Okay.
[240:51.76]I don't have much time.
[240:54.58]Um...
[240:57.05]I wonder if there's a place where I'm safe from the fire or something.
[241:10.36]Whoa, what is this?
[241:10.90]Yep.
[241:11.36]Hold on.
[241:15.88]I don't have time to explore that.
[241:21.68]Oh, how do I go?
[241:22.26]Um.
[241:27.98]Where should I go?
[241:28.44]I don't know.
[241:30.85]I'm just gonna keep going this way.
[242:06.94]Where's your flame guard, punk?
[242:13.45]Uh-oh, really?
[242:14.80]Where?
[242:17.50]Where is it?
[242:47.95]Oh, it's a chameleon.
[242:54.56]How am I going to actually be able to get up there in 10 minutes?
[243:20.80]That's a good question.
[243:28.54]Oh, hey, what's up?
[243:31.62]Go to Goron City.
[243:32.51]Alright, cool.
[243:34.63]Well, looky here.
[243:36.01]Welcome, Master Link.
[243:37.75]How did you know?
[243:38.25]What do you mean?
[243:40.31]More importantly, I hope you made it past all those magma bombs without injury.
[243:45.01]To be honest, we haven't had many visitors here since those magma bombs started falling from the sky.
[243:49.37]I'd be bored to tears if I didn't pass the time pretending to greet the long-lost Hylian champion.
[243:54.23]Heh.
[243:56.40]Oh, in case you didn't know, Link is the little Hylian who fought alongside the Goron champion Daruk.
[244:02.20]If you want to hear more, talk to the boss.
[244:04.76]He lives further in town.
[244:08.02]Am I safe in here?
[244:09.06]No, it's like a million degrees.
[244:12.70]I didn't mean... Did I hit you with that?
[244:18.65]Am I actually, uh, will I die in six minutes?
[244:24.82]Maybe I can buy like a flame suit from town here.
[244:27.96]I bet you I can.
[244:31.70]I'd be shocked if you couldn't.
[244:37.14]Who sells this armor?
[244:48.97]That blasted Rudania.
[244:51.95]With Rudania running wild recently, Death Mountain's eruptions have gotten real bad.
[244:58.95]Do you see Rudania stomping around up there on the mountain?
[245:02.21]They said that a hundred years ago it actually used to protect our people from harm.
[245:05.60]But that was then and this is now.
[245:07.68]Now all it does is mess up our mining operations.
[245:09.64]We're all suffering because it's stopping us from doing business.
[245:14.50]Can't tell you how many times we've used the cannon to chase off that fiend.
[245:19.79]But it always comes back.
[245:22.83]Yowch.
[245:23.47]Ow.
[245:25.03]Just some back pain.
[245:26.67]Wait, who are you?
[245:29.81]I see, so then you came all this way to pay your respects to me.
[245:32.33]I like you already, brother.
[245:34.63]Well, my name's Bluto.
[245:37.19]I'm the great Goron boss who's fearsome enough to silence a crying child.
[245:41.61]Or to make a silenced child cry, either way.
[245:45.36]Yes, it's none other than I, Bluto.
[245:48.64]I was planning on a drive off for Dania, like I always do.
[245:52.74]But then this blasted pain in my back flared up out of nowhere.
[245:57.78]Blasted Yonobo.
[245:59.84]When will he return?
[246:02.15]Yonobo is a young Goron who helps me drive off for Dania.
[246:09.31]He went to grab some painkillers for my back from the abandoned north mine.
[246:13.68]Really hasn't come back yet.
[246:18.87]Ah!
[246:19.01]Oh, ouch.
[246:19.35]Okay.
[246:20.35]I need to buy armor.
[246:21.83]He said the thing.
[246:22.59]Oh, yay.
[246:22.95]He said it.
[246:50.95]That's the one thing I have not retired, right?
[246:59.22]I keep doing the Mr. Satan.
[247:01.74]I just won't stop it.
[247:03.78]Ooh.
[247:12.45]Okay, there is... Okay, right here.
[247:15.13]I got a lot of money.
[247:16.73]Should be good, right?
[247:24.09]okay oh right here we go alright flame breaker armor it's made fire resistant rocks to protect the wear how much is it 600 I need it
[247:49.60]Cool.
[247:51.66]Now, what about the other stuff?
[247:54.63]Flame guards, it's 700.
[248:00.21]If I just have one piece, is that okay?
[248:02.15]Do you need the whole set?
[248:03.78]I need the whole set?
[248:04.76]No way.
[248:05.32]I have a lot of gems.
[248:15.29]I should probably go upgrade it too, though, right?
[248:23.45]I need at least two.
[248:27.77]Two out of three will protect you.
[248:28.89]Okay.
[248:29.77]What's the cheapest one?
[248:30.39]I probably should get the pants.
[248:33.22]And upgrade it.
[248:34.38]One piece is real.
[248:35.46]Okay.
[248:46.26]Ooh.
[248:56.41]This is two thousand what?
[249:01.12]Why is that so much?
[249:01.84]Why is that so expensive?
[249:05.24]Excuse me.
[249:05.82]I need to go to the forest area and upgrade this.
[249:21.69]This is a three armor.
[249:22.97]Are you kidding me?
[249:23.51]That's terrible.
[249:28.88]Yeah, I'm getting out of here.
[249:32.77]I do need to get to a shrine first.
[249:35.75]Which I think is probably one here.
[249:38.55]I'm not staying.
[249:39.21]I need to find the shrine so I can teleport back here.
[249:43.03]You need the helmet.
[249:51.30]Where's the shrine?
[249:52.20]Above?
[250:04.31]I need a place to teleport to.
[250:05.49]Because I can't teleport to over here yet.
[250:21.65]Where is this shrine?
[250:39.42]You don't need the helmet.
[251:00.28]You only need one piece.
[251:01.30]The one piece is real, I suppose.
[251:09.09]What's this?
[251:18.66]Good.
[251:21.38]God damn it.
[251:27.81]Don't just get rid of it.
[251:28.91]Oh, look at that up there.
[251:38.43]I'm trying to find the shrine.
[251:39.47]I'm going up here.
[251:49.41]It's definitely up.
[251:51.09]Has to be.
[252:01.77]Yep.
[252:16.24]Oh, you stupid Mega Man enemy.
[252:17.78]I hate those things.
[252:18.44]Okay.
[252:35.77]No, where is it?
[252:43.39]Oh.
[252:47.82]Can I move this?
[253:24.45]Let's go!
[253:28.95]That was fun.
[253:39.71]There it is.
[253:40.53]Yes!
[253:44.10]Shrine time.
[253:53.80]Alright, what do we think?
[253:54.36]Seven minutes with the chest?
[254:00.51]Hello?
[254:00.69]What was that?
[254:06.22]Oh, it's you.
[254:06.64]Okay.
[254:09.04]Alright, seven minutes with the chest.
[254:10.60]I think that sounds pretty good to me.
[254:24.01]I didn't touch anything.
[254:25.53]I was resting my leg.
[254:39.88]I got the armor.
[254:40.42]It's on right now.
[254:41.06]Look.
[254:46.67]He's looking right at me.
[254:55.70]I didn't like that.
[254:56.76]That was weird.
[254:58.78]Alright.
[254:59.92]Get it in.
[255:00.36]Let's go.
[255:02.74]You know the deal.
[255:04.58]Right when I get control of the character.
[255:05.97]One second.
[255:07.27]Go.
[255:11.77]Get those bets in.
[255:13.47]I'm going to concentrate.
[255:14.17]I'm not going to talk.
[255:17.37]Here we go.
[255:21.13]Get them in.
[255:22.75]What is it?
[255:28.65]Here we... time!
[255:41.55]I need fire.
[255:42.11]I need fire.
[255:45.92]Um... Make our own!
[256:08.43]Okay, alright.
[256:10.51]Chest.
[256:15.54]Stone?
[256:15.98]Holy shit.
[256:16.84]Is that 42 damage?
[256:24.00]Oh my goodness.
[256:30.37]This thing is insane.
[256:33.35]Okay.
[256:33.57]Okay.
[256:38.47]I got that.
[256:38.99]Now we need to burn something.
[256:41.93]Alright.
[256:55.37]I don't know why I did that, but I did it.
[257:14.11]Guardian Sword!
[257:34.00]Just...
[257:43.14]Okay, that's two chests down.
[257:45.72]Take a look over here.
[258:01.71]I know what to do about this, I think.
[258:22.71]Uh-huh.
[258:24.87]What the fuck was that?
[258:26.71]Never mind, go this way.
[258:40.90]Key.
[258:43.18]Do I need a key?
[258:44.26]This place is huge!
[258:45.18]How am I ever gonna do this in seven minutes?
[258:47.96]This place is enormous, guys.
[258:49.72]How was I supposed to ever do this?
[259:07.44]Why did I just do that?
[259:09.08]Whatever.
[259:17.54]This place is enormous.
[259:19.02]It's enormous.
[259:19.61]There's no way I was going to get this done.
[259:22.27]Not a chance in hell.
[259:34.68]Yeah, congratulations to everybody.
[259:35.78]This is the longest dungeon I've done so far.
[259:42.10]Don't roll off!
[259:43.40]What is stopping me?
[259:53.03]Stay here!
[259:53.81]Don't fucking move!
[260:05.58]I didn't know you could even do that.
[260:30.57]Um, okay.
[260:31.55]Now, alright.
[260:55.29]I got the right idea, but whatever, fuck it.
[261:08.56]I got the right idea.
[261:09.14]I mean, you might as well pay out the people that bet against it, because there's no way I'm going to do this.
[261:23.43]Wait, I don't even need to do that anymore.
[261:26.21]Hold on.
[261:26.71]Oops.
[261:48.73]Okay, cool.
[261:58.90]e wait a minute how much time what do I have time what do I get time time time time what's my time time time time time what's my time oh not even close congratulations you won
[262:58.54]What does this do?
[263:03.90]Okay.
[263:17.03]I can't grab that?
[263:20.51]Can I?
[263:21.25]Hold on.
[263:28.89]No.
[263:29.29]Whoops.
[263:30.17]What?
[263:34.48]Why did it want me to come down?
[263:35.68]What was it for?
[263:36.52]What was that even for?
[263:56.66]Okay.
[263:57.60]Do I need to do anything else over there?
[263:58.76]I mean, I need to get the barrel.
[264:04.52]I'm just going to burn it, but... Oh.
[264:11.00]I can't, like, yank it.
[264:12.28]I mean, technically I could... Does this work?
[264:20.59]Can I just break it?
[264:21.19]I could hit it with a sword or something.
[264:23.63]Arrows?
[264:27.27]I could just shoot it with a fire arrow.
[264:28.47]I don't have any arrows.
[264:37.42]I mean, I'm just gonna... Will bomb work?
[264:40.20]Does bomb cause fire?
[264:41.16]I don't think I've ever tested this.
[264:47.55]Okay, that worked.
[264:58.13]Oh my god, it was literally right here.
[265:05.56]So many people were probably just going like, JUST SHOOT IT!
[265:09.54]SHOOT IT WITH A FUCKING ARROW!
[265:11.68]Just screaming and they lost all their points.
[265:17.08]I'm sitting here like, oh, puzzle.
[265:18.58]Okay, so like, oh, oh, yeah, put that over there.
[265:22.13]Oh, yeah, move that and, uh, no.
[265:24.53]I just shoot with an arrow.
[265:45.97]Dude, you suck.
[265:48.23]Hey.
[265:49.51]Close it.
[265:50.49]Close this.
[265:51.61]Close this.
[265:52.79]Mm-hmm.
[265:53.49]Mm-hmm.
[265:54.29]Mm.
[265:55.71]I don't want to hear it.
[265:57.25]I don't want to hear it.
[265:57.91]I don't even want to hear it.
[265:58.75]Mm-hmm.
[266:02.81]Mm-hmm.
[266:05.63]Pay him out.
[266:07.37]Pay him out.
[266:09.42]Pay him out.
[266:11.95]You overthought that so much.
[266:13.61]Yep, I don't know.
[266:14.25]I'm thinking like, oh, it's a puzzle.
[266:15.45]I gotta be careful.
[266:16.03]What if I get it wrong and chat goes, oh, I'm just, I don't know.
[266:20.05]I'm thinking about people thinking I'm stupid and I just don't shoot with an arrow.
[266:23.41]Did I get the chest?
[266:28.05]I got all the chests, right?
[266:36.69]So I have a teleport now.
[266:39.63]Wait, let me... Let me check over here.
[266:45.25]You just killed those birds.
[266:46.33]I didn't... You are a monster!
[266:47.77]Alright, I promise I wouldn't scream today.
[266:58.70]Hello.
[267:02.50]So many people out and about.
[267:04.05]You should know it gets much harder past here.
[267:06.35]There are also lots of monsters.
[267:08.05]It's dangerous.
[267:10.75]Okay.
[267:13.13]This is the abandoned north mine.
[267:15.13]Oh, and this is the little ditty we all used to sing as we worked.
[267:21.72]Ammo goes boom till ore fills the room.
[267:24.52]Gather said ore for rupees galore.
[267:27.60]Dig all day to get the good pay.
[267:32.52]That's a pretty good song.
[267:36.27]Oh, there's more.
[267:40.56]You get the idea.
[267:51.73]You gonna put your stand up?
[267:53.05]You gonna put your hands up?
[267:58.95]Okay.
[268:00.81]What's a stranger like you asking about?
[268:02.53]You know, Bo.
[268:04.27]The boss wants to know.
[268:05.39]What?
[268:06.65]Okay.
[268:10.08]Cool.
[268:11.00]Went to the vault to fetch some painkillers, but now that you mention it, I suppose he never came back.
[268:18.09]It's dangerous.
[268:18.73]Don't go looking for him.
[268:20.87]Okay.
[268:24.61]Divine Beast Varudania.
[268:28.24]Alright.
[268:29.36]Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[268:31.40]Alright, I need to get the heck out of here.
[268:34.60]Because I want to upgrade the gear.
[268:40.93]That was where?
[268:48.01]Down here, right?
[268:49.62]No, no, no, no, no.
[268:50.94]Over here?
[268:53.10]Right here, right?
[269:01.12]Cacorico, yep.
[269:07.53]Did you already add Jerma Turtle?
[269:10.67]That was quick.
[269:21.87]Oh, from when I started singing to when the singing stopped, I lost 400 subs.
[269:25.41]I'm just kidding.
[269:28.60]I made that up.
[269:41.71]I made it up.
[269:42.21]I'm kidding.
[269:50.04]So what does it take to upgrade this gear?
[269:52.92]I wonder.
[269:56.04]What am I going to be for Halloween?
[269:58.80]Um, a turtle.
[270:10.35]Hmm.
[270:19.35]Shit.
[270:19.89]Alright, I need... Fireproof lizards.
[270:24.63]Where do I get those?
[270:26.61]Did I ever take a picture of those?
[270:27.53]Aren't they kind of just running around outside?
[270:31.04]You said you were going to be a pineapple.
[270:39.90]Okay, so I gotta go back there.
[270:49.52]Buy more from Beetle?
[270:50.46]Okay.
[270:53.30]I've seen them run around as they catch them.
[271:08.50]How much longer are you going to stream for?
[271:10.72]I don't know.
[271:11.44]Maybe like an hour or two.
[271:14.90]I definitely will, at the very least, get inside of the divine beast area, right?
[271:20.77]Okay, looking for lizards.
[271:23.21]If I see a lizard, I want to take a picture of it.
[271:24.63]Get the camera ready.
[271:45.32]Lizards.
[272:02.27]I'm just scanning the ground.
[272:04.27]I'm just trying to see if I can see any.
[273:10.79]See any?
[273:16.91]Does it count?
[273:30.99]That didn't count.
[273:43.66]There we go.
[273:44.24]Nice.
[273:44.74]Okay.
[273:48.65]What the fuck?
[273:55.36]Alright.
[274:07.33]How many do I need?
[274:22.70]I need 12?
[274:24.72]That's a lot.
[274:25.22]Oh, I don't want to watch that.
[274:28.28]Okay.
[274:33.28]Okay, down here.
[274:34.14]I don't
[274:49.95]I don't, okay.
[274:50.91]I can't go there.
[275:11.45]You're gonna scare the fish.
[275:12.41]Get out of here.
[275:36.19]I don't.
[275:38.35]Yeah.
[276:15.25]I don't see one.
[276:19.19]Oh wait, right here?
[276:22.29]No.
[277:04.77]How many do I need?
[277:07.03]Two or three or four?
[277:38.21]I need nine more.
[277:39.23]I don't have the materials to even make it.
[277:47.87]You only need two with your current upgrade kit.
[277:49.51]Alright, so I'm good then.
[277:50.47]Let's do two.
[278:03.20]Okay.
[278:04.76]That makes sense.
[278:14.02]Do you have the strategy guide open on another monitor?
[278:15.60]Nah, dude.
[278:20.73]Shut up.
[278:27.87]Shut up.
[278:28.35]Shut the fuck up.
[278:30.25]Shut up.
[278:32.79]Alright, so let's go do this.
[278:56.25]Omega lull.
[279:05.34]It's such a classic song.
[279:07.22]Hmm.
[279:16.66]Alright, this will go to five.
[279:21.30]It's not that much.
[279:28.89]Better than nothing.
[279:29.91]It's better than nothing.
[279:50.95]I could do this again oh wait I am so dumb I okay do you know why it's because it was in the same slot I was like wait again no because it was literally the same spot and it moved
[280:20.90]If you got all the chests in a shrine, there should be a chest icon near or on the shrine's map.
[280:25.49]Oh, alright.
[280:26.77]That's good to know.
[280:27.21]Do I have anything?
[280:30.39]Can I do anything else?
[280:31.17]I guess I could do this.
[280:34.95]Am I going to utilize this again?
[280:36.13]Should I just do it while I'm here?
[280:40.07]Yeah, probably.
[280:43.01]Not worth it?
[280:43.54]Oh.
[280:43.90]Because I already... I mean, not really.
[280:46.74]Just kind of a swimming...
[280:59.92]Alright, cool.
[281:03.21]Let's... I have plenty of healing.
[281:05.53]I got tons of food and shit.
[281:07.31]So I think I'll be alright.
[281:11.35]So let me head to the Divine Beast.
[281:16.05]See how it goes.
[281:22.61]Post a tweet draft.
[281:23.59]You know what?
[281:23.91]I think I still copy and pasted it.
[281:25.59]Let me see.
[281:29.15]Yeah, no, it's literally still copy.
[281:31.01]It's still on my clipboard.
[281:36.65]We were talking about the adult happy meal that I was like, wait, how is that?
[281:39.57]There's an adult happy meal coming out or something.
[281:41.81]And I was like, what does that even mean?
[281:42.83]It's just a regular meal.
[281:43.70]That's what an adult happy meal is.
[281:46.56]And we were talking about like, what the hell would even be in it?
[281:50.27]Uh, and I was gonna write a tweet that said, uh, the adult Happy Meal, colon, one single can of Bud Light, two cigarettes, a ten-piece nugget, and three business cards.
[282:02.46]One for a landscaping company, one for a CPA, and one for a real estate agent.
[282:10.33]Gonna put it in the drafts.
[282:20.56]Thought I'd put it in the draft.
[282:21.76]You know, hold on to it for a while.
[282:34.27]Honestly, though, what is... What... What is in the adult Happy Meal?
[282:39.81]I'm imagining a bunch of businessmen in suits going to McDonald's and getting Happy Meals rather than going out for drinks.
[283:04.64]What's in it?
[283:08.94]It's so funny how this is rated E for everyone, but Mario Odyssey technically isn't because it has a tank.
[283:13.60]What?
[283:13.92]Is that real?
[283:18.38]Dude, it's just a solid gold bar.
[283:24.34]I don't even know.
[283:25.62]That's like a funny joke, I guess.
[283:26.96]That's so outrageous.
[283:29.30]I can't even laugh at that.
[283:30.43]What are you talking about?
[283:36.38]Why would there be a solid gold bar in a fucking Happy Meal?
[283:40.27]Ooh!
[284:16.01]Oh, wait.
[284:17.73]Oh, no, no, no.
[284:18.09]I can turn this off.
[284:18.61]This is just for the lizards, right?
[284:19.97]Yeah, okay.
[284:20.41]Is there a... I can't do ice over here, right?
[284:40.32]That guy didn't even know he died.
[284:47.77]Okay.
[284:49.87]Can I do the ice cubes here?
[284:53.78]Oh.
[284:54.56]My.
[284:54.86]God.
[284:55.56]Was that my good one?
[284:56.70]Oh my goodness.
[284:59.76]No, it was the shitty one.
[285:00.94]Thank God.
[285:01.72]What the fuck just happened?
[285:04.66]Okay.
[285:05.30]I was- I can't.
[285:11.39]Does this hurt if I walk in this?
[285:16.43]That hurts a lot.
[285:17.45]Cool.
[285:47.37]Who cares though?
[285:47.93]What's that?
[285:49.31]What's that do for me?
[285:53.61]Can I move it?
[286:31.26]I didn't know that was a lever look at that that does not look like a lever what the hell that's like just a big chunk of metal sticking out of the ground
[286:49.23]Okay.
[287:22.67]Am I gonna gonzo out of this?
[287:56.38]I was supposed to shoot myself in the face with a cannon.
[288:01.83]What do I do?
[288:02.45]Uh, I actually kinda don't get it.
[288:04.59]I'm not a fucking Looney Tunes character.
[288:16.74]Alright, well... Do I have to, like...
[288:26.89]What is it even doing?
[288:28.83]Should I go catch it or something?
[288:29.99]There has to be a reason for that.
[288:35.45]Let me load it first.
[288:51.06]Hold on.
[288:59.25]Okay, so what else can I even do over here?
[289:01.83]It's hitting right here.
[289:09.11]Okay, what does that matter?
[289:30.44]I mean, that was kind of cool, but it didn't really do anything.
[289:34.67]Oh, there's another cannon.
[289:35.51]Nice.
[289:42.91]Nice, dude.
[289:47.65]Nice.
[290:10.05]You guys can't even reach
[290:38.20]The soldier's belt.
[290:38.84]Just get rid of it.
[290:48.71]Ooh.
[290:55.74]The cannon over there.
[291:13.42]Yup.
[291:17.27]See that?
[291:25.41]You watching?
[291:26.15]Nice.
[291:51.79]Close again.
[292:00.93]Oh man, it's sometimes it hurts to be so good.
[292:17.20]Really?
[292:21.08]I said you're not funny.
[292:23.40]You've been subbed for like three months.
[292:25.84]You're a liar.
[292:46.15]No!
[292:46.55]Don't fall!
[292:50.51]Hey, well, my mother said I was funny, so... Sorry.
[292:58.87]Do I really have to destroy the whole thing?
[293:14.64]Kind of excessive.
[293:24.53]Oh shit, cool.
[293:29.99]Your thoughts on aging and dying.
[293:31.55]Fuck.
[293:39.54]Damn.
[293:39.92]I mean, you got.
[293:49.92]Hold on.
[294:05.87]It's crazy.
[294:18.23]Shrine over here.
[294:25.80]This I like this zone.
[294:26.72]This is cool.
[294:39.45]Just in case there's something over there.
[294:40.43]That'll do it, right?
[294:48.24]Yes!
[294:50.72]Ooh, what's in there?
[294:53.48]Is the music a bit?
[294:54.66]What?
[294:58.15]Oh my god, you freaked me out.
[294:59.01]I thought there was a song playing this whole time. ...
[295:21.48]Two chests in here?
[295:26.66]Oh man, oh man, oh man.
[295:29.80]What am I gonna do?
[295:33.77]Boxers!
[295:35.07]They're here!
[295:36.45]They found me!
[295:37.27]Help!
[295:37.81]Huh?
[295:58.76]Now that I got a good look at it, that's definitely, that's gotta be a Holly.
[296:03.67]what are you doing I'm kidding I'm making them to stop alright were you the one who broke through that crag to rescue me goro thanks brother what brought you all the way out here to begin with okay so where how do we get to the divine beast from here everyone calls me you know bow makes sense goro I came to get some painkillers for boss but a magma bomb caused a rock slides sealing the entrance
[296:33.92]By the way, how did you break those rocks at the entrance?
[296:37.68]With a cannon.
[296:38.98]You used the boss's cannons.
[296:41.24]That thing is so difficult to use, I thought only boss could handle it.
[296:45.73]It's not the time to chat.
[296:46.95]I gotta deliver these painkillers.
[296:48.71]Okay.
[296:53.31]There's a reward for you.
[296:56.19]Was this a little side quest?
[296:57.77]Or is this part of the main story?
[296:59.65]That was fun.
[297:12.89]There's a shrine out here, too.
[297:22.34]Nice.
[297:23.34]I need that money.
[297:27.62]Why don't I pick up something through the wall or something?
[297:31.13]Lots of ice arrows.
[297:44.36]You get the shaggy look again?
[297:51.12]It's because I have a green shirt on.
[297:52.06]Alright, very cool.
[297:55.33]Where is the shrine?
[297:57.47]This thing was beeping.
[297:58.27]Okay.
[298:22.50]Shit.
[298:53.82]I have to ride on a mine cart.
[299:08.79]Can I get there from here?
[299:11.69]Maybe I can.
[299:12.26]Hold on.
[299:23.53]That scared the shit out of me.
[299:24.85]Alright, um... What's the point of these rocks then?
[299:49.54]No, whatever.
[299:50.02]I'm just going to go back.
[299:51.62]I'll turn around and come down this way, though.
[299:53.58]Let me mark on the map where that is.
[299:54.72]I think that's important.
[300:00.04]Well, now I'm just dead.
[300:00.84]I literally can't leave.
[300:01.74]I have to teleport out.
[300:05.02]Make an up... Wait, bomb launch yourself?
[300:15.99]Time that person up for five minutes.
[300:30.01]Make a fire.
[300:30.75]Where's... There it is.
[301:05.81]Why did it make... What happened?
[301:07.01]Why did it make three?
[301:07.89]Alright, let's go.
[301:08.53]Fuck it.
[301:11.19]How do I... How do I do it?
[301:12.31]How do I use it?
[301:13.95]How do I do this?
[301:19.05]How do I do it?
[301:33.48]Does it... I need more?
[301:36.02]More wood?
[301:36.57]That actually worked!
[301:51.12]I thought you guys were just making jokes!
[301:52.54]Wow!
[301:52.90]Alright, I made it!
[301:53.48]Are you serious?
[301:56.06]That actually worked!
[302:02.57]Okay.
[302:03.89]So... Now... Can I Spider-Man under here?
[302:22.05]I thought I could Spider-Man under here.
[302:27.82]Okay, we're good.
[302:38.88]No!
[302:52.95]No!
[302:53.53]God!
[302:53.95]Okay, I'm fine.
[302:54.93]Stop screaming and relax.
[302:56.09]You're gonna spawn right there.
[303:03.71]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[303:06.11]Alright.
[303:51.76]Oh, the cart doesn't work.
[303:54.54]It's probably at the very end.
[303:55.32]Alright, if I can make it the entire track by walking this whole thing, what do I get?
[304:04.04]Oh.
[304:08.54]Did I try it?
[304:19.95]Okay, let me just see how fun this is.
[304:36.98]Woo-hoo!
[305:02.85]We're good.
[305:20.12]Let's have it go wicked fast.
[305:36.36]How do you make it go faster?
[305:38.20]Use bombs?
[305:50.05]Um, I don't want to blow that up.
[305:58.75]I don't get it.
[306:02.78]No, Stace is just bomb.
[306:16.51]Wait, you put a bomb in here?
[306:20.43]What the fuck?
[306:20.97]Does that actually work?
[306:29.50]I want to go this way.
[307:10.17]Oh, shit!
[307:15.22]I was protected, I thought.
[307:17.80]Where am I going to end up?
[307:19.64]Alright, we're good.
[307:21.58]Why was that?
[307:21.96]It didn't happen the first three times.
[307:25.38]Alright, I get it.
[307:25.92]That's fun.
[307:27.32]Are we doing a timer?
[307:36.00]No, no shrine bit this time.
[307:42.10]Ah, well, we're doing it.
[307:45.75]I gotta pause it so you guys can't see.
[307:48.07]I don't want you to see what it is.
[307:48.99]You know what I mean?
[307:53.83]Because then I don't want to give you guys a, oh wait, this is what it is.
[307:56.52]I don't want you to see.
[308:02.32]Oh my god.
[308:03.22]Dude, what?
[308:07.46]Holy shit.
[308:10.29]This is gonna be impossible.
[308:13.27]Oh my god.
[308:17.93]This is impossible.
[308:18.97]I just want to let everybody know.
[308:31.57]Is he serious?
[308:32.37]Or is it a minor test of strength?
[308:37.01]I don't know.
[308:43.02]Okay, we are going to begin.
[308:44.35]Uh, by the way, this looks like it's gonna be fucking impossible and I meant that.
[308:51.31]Three, two, one, start.
[309:09.52]Fire.
[309:09.80]Okay.
[309:11.80]Water.
[309:32.41]That's a torch.
[309:33.23]Oh shit.
[309:36.31]What can I get rid of?
[309:36.85]Should I just take the fire rod and swing it at stuff?
[309:41.71]I'll go back for the chest.
[309:52.36]Don't worry.
[309:52.80]How much time do I have?
[310:00.87]I'll go back for it.
[310:17.45]Let's go.
[310:37.01]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[310:38.15]What happened?
[310:40.07]I can't light this.
[310:46.89]I can't light that with the blue one.
[310:50.22]What?
[310:50.40]Is that for real?
[311:01.55]Wait, can I walk?
[311:02.97]That sucks.
[311:07.71]No, what?
[311:08.09]How am I supposed to do this?
[311:09.08]I have to walk?
[311:13.64]I cannot go over here.
[311:15.84]How am I physically going to be able to get over there?
[312:31.72]I just blew up something.
[312:36.97]I tried.
[312:37.33]I tried it.
[312:45.86]Um, is there a ball or something?
[312:47.46]I wish I had a flame to shoot or something.
[312:51.10]I don't know.
[313:01.11]I don't know.
[313:03.47]I actually just don't know.
[313:04.37]It's gonna take me more than like five minutes to figure it out.
[313:12.55]I need arrows.
[313:13.29]What the fuck?
[313:15.53]I need arrows.
[313:17.30]You do it with arrows, right?
[313:18.38]I just don't have any.
[313:20.58]It's like a weird other way to do this that I just don't.
[313:22.90]I don't understand.
[313:42.40]Shit, how do I get that?
[313:47.78]Can't reach from here.
[313:48.36]What do I have for time?
[314:11.95]I'll get the chest at least.
[314:15.45]Yeah.
[314:43.76]I don't know why Mario doesn't decide to grab half the time.
[314:59.48]Holy shit, that's an amazing bow.
[315:05.50]Sorry guys.
[315:07.98]All I can do is just shoot it from here or something?
[315:12.08]I don't know what if I shoot it from here well I completely missed but whatever um I don't know I'll figure it out eventually the ice it's hot hot I know I don't know yeah I lose you guys win
[315:44.59]Sorry.
[315:46.72]Tried.
[315:46.98]If I had arrows, this would be no problem at all.
[316:03.27]But I don't.
[316:04.65]So I gotta... I don't know.
[316:08.43]Stumped.
[316:13.86]Stumped.
[316:18.85]Free him.
[316:20.35]And let him out.
[316:20.79]Football.
[316:28.44]Throw football.
[316:31.08]Burn the wood and fly.
[316:38.08]Alright.
[316:38.46]Burn a shitload of wood and fly up.
[316:40.44]That actually is funny.
[316:43.34]It was saying throw the torch.
[316:47.68]Oh, but I don't think I can make it from here.
[316:50.89]I can't make it from there.
[316:52.63]Okay, I honestly did not think I could make it that far.
[316:58.91]I was like, there was no chance in my brain that that was going to make it.
[317:05.09]I didn't even want to attempt it because it was like, it's not possible.
[317:07.77]Like, there's no way you can go that far.
[317:10.95]That was just a... That was a complete...
[317:13.82]thought.
[317:15.12]Oh, throw the torch.
[317:15.90]That was the first thing I thought of.
[317:17.56]And it's like, oh, okay, no, no, no way.
[317:20.76]No chance in hell.
[317:21.52]It's not possible.
[317:22.32]It just physically isn't possible.
[317:27.90]But apparently it is.
[317:32.18]Okay.
[317:43.23]Throw the torch.
[317:46.49]You guys are so funny.
[317:50.01]Alright, well, let's try it again.
[317:51.15]Oh, shit.
[318:00.35]Gamer fatigue?
[318:01.25]No!
[318:02.85]That's not it.
[318:07.37]Oh, these are all lit.
[318:09.50]No, not gamer fatigue.
[318:43.75]Oops.
[318:48.43]It's still up there.
[318:49.37]Oh my god.
[318:50.03]I think I have to die.
[318:57.50]No, it's not gamer fatigue.
[318:58.72]It's not gamer fatigue.
[319:01.12]Is it gamer fatigue?
[319:01.96]It could be.
[319:02.32]Alright, I'm going to build a fire.
[319:29.76]Why are they not burning?
[319:45.14]Uh...
[320:00.20]Is it enough?
[320:04.90]What else can I burn?
[320:05.76]Anything else?
[320:12.07]It's one more.
[320:13.67]Oh my God.
[320:14.73]They don't work in shrines.
[320:15.83]Okay.
[320:16.13]Well, whatever.
[320:30.81]Alright, I need to... I need to restart.
[320:34.17]Wind doesn't work in shrines?
[320:36.57]That's unfortunate.
[320:42.72]That sad, crying Pepe.
[320:45.50]Just like, no!
[320:47.18]It can't be!
[320:52.72]It almost just took... I almost just... Okay, I almost just kept running, and I was like, oh, phew!
[320:57.30]I made it!
[320:58.04]And then the camera pans around, and half of my other half behind me is gone.
[321:03.95]It's like you just see through everything.
[321:05.31]It's like I'm cutting half this way.
[321:12.38]Okay.
[321:12.62]Let's try it again.
[321:45.19]This is burning me.
[321:48.89]Just die.
[321:49.57]I have to do it again.
[321:53.83]You have another torch.
[321:55.65]I don't have any arrows.
[321:57.95]Go buy arrows.
[321:58.77]I'm already in here.
[322:05.56]You're trending on Twitter.
[322:06.62]Why?
[322:08.62]What did I do?
[322:12.07]You can teleport.
[322:12.75]I know, but I have to at least prove that I'm capable of doing this.
[322:29.85]One arrow, Andy.
[322:47.38]Just buy arrows.
[322:47.88]Where are they?
[322:48.72]Who sells them?
[322:54.39]Who sells them?
[322:58.29]Don't tell him.
[322:58.81]He doesn't want to know.
[322:59.49]He doesn't need to know.
[323:04.95]Your forehead's big.
[323:06.38]It's not.
[323:07.38]It's not.
[323:07.76]It just really isn't.
[323:08.42]What do you know?
[323:10.22]No, my forehead's not big.
[323:13.62]My hairline is receding.
[323:14.72]Get it right.
[323:21.35]Okay.
[323:24.37]Uh, who sells arrows here?
[323:25.51]General store?
[323:29.77]I imagine the general store.
[323:42.89]Yeah, I have a normal sized forehead.
[323:46.69]It's just my hair is going backwards.
[323:48.01]Do you have arrows here?
[324:03.82]You got arrows?
[324:05.44]You do.
[324:08.54]I want them all.
[324:11.90]What are these?
[324:14.00]You got these arrows?
[324:15.94]I want all of them.
[324:21.24]Any more arrows in this house?
[324:23.24]I want these.
[324:23.82]I want them all.
[324:31.33]FSO.
[324:33.73]This person has a quest.
[324:35.49]I'll do it later.
[324:36.19]Uh-oh.
[324:53.78]What's your favorite piano note?
[324:55.98]The one that sounds like this.
[325:00.14]You know the one.
[325:02.61]The very end.
[325:11.40]Either the very end of the right side or the very end of the left side.
[325:14.39]Because you just press it hard once on the left and it's a scary noise.
[325:21.49]And then you go to the right and you do the last two notes into just 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2.
[325:27.30]And it could be something magical or somebody sneaking.
[325:52.19]Come on.
[326:06.16]Like this.
[326:07.58]You know.
[326:15.49]Or.
[326:31.14]Does it do the shrine?
[326:32.07]Alright.
[326:42.83]If I stand up, am I dead?
[326:47.36]I can't stand up!
[326:48.36]I can't stand up.
[326:57.15]I couldn't even hear what that sounded like.
[327:01.60]Because I'm plugged in.
[327:02.26]I'm listening to the Switch audio, not the desktop audio.
[327:06.52]Dropping frames.
[327:07.10]I know.
[327:07.40]It's because, I don't know, for some reason, every time I try to stream at 8 o'clock to 9 p.m., I have issues.
[327:13.69]I don't care.
[327:18.87]It's fine.
[327:41.01]Alright, we're good.
[327:42.95]I am going to eat though.
[327:46.81]Very cool.
[327:56.72]So let's do this.
[328:01.21]Imagine that's the thing to do.
[328:03.55]Bye.
[328:10.47]Imagine if I had arrows, I would have just beat it.
[328:12.09]60, that thing is so, so good.
[328:21.96]Uh, okay.
[328:41.36]Two chests up here.
[328:42.16]Nice.
[328:49.96]Ooh.
[328:53.68]Alright, that's cool.
[328:55.32]Big flame sword.
[328:56.08]These are really, really good items for just kind of walking up here.
[329:23.27]I don't have the torch anymore.
[329:35.01]Rate this game out of 10.
[329:35.87]I know you people keep asking me to do that, but I'm not going to.
[330:01.23]Huh?
[330:03.15]Wait.
[330:03.47]Oh, there's water spraying.
[330:05.67]Oh, shit.
[330:06.30]Okay.
[330:06.78]Um, hold on.
[330:09.56]Um, wait.
[330:10.58]Hold on a second.
[330:32.70]Okay.
[330:38.36]Okay.
[330:45.62]Alright.
[330:47.96]Well, I have an idea.
[330:51.32]Shoot them at the same time.
[331:18.32]Oh wait.
[331:19.28]Okay.
[331:52.36]Okay.
[331:59.03]Okay.
[332:09.84]Okay.
[332:10.60]I'm going to be streaming from a Windows 94 computer.
[332:14.96]What does that mean?
[332:22.47]We're good.
[332:29.41]Ooh, wait a minute.
[332:35.41]There's a lot of chests in this one.
[332:36.58]I was never going to do this in seven minutes.
[332:38.08]Forest dweller sword?
[332:42.08]I think it's time to get rid of this.
[332:47.90]Cool.
[332:56.78]22 damage?
[332:57.12]That's good.
[333:00.06]I'm running out of shitty weapons to care about.
[333:01.99]To not care about.
[333:03.19]Okay.
[333:28.92]Ooh.
[333:31.44]Burn.
[333:31.88]Alright.
[333:32.38]Cool.
[333:32.69]Guardian spirit.
[333:34.01]Oh, my goodness.
[333:35.23]I can't pick any of these up.
[333:42.81]Shit.
[333:43.93]I don't know what to do.
[333:45.39]I guess I could get rid of this.
[333:47.09]What's better?
[333:48.82]You're lagging.
[333:49.46]I know.
[333:49.84]It doesn't matter.
[333:53.76]I guess I'll get rid of the fire rod.
[333:55.00]Yeah.
[333:55.10]Yeah.
[333:59.04]It's cool, but... Guardian Spear.
[334:15.45]Ancient Battle Axe.
[334:18.45]30 versus... Okay, nah, this is probably it.
[334:22.17]This is 30 damage.
[334:24.23]Everything else is good.
[334:25.01]Maybe get rid of the Cobble Crusher.
[334:32.62]And pick up the sword.
[334:38.33]Guardian sword is 20 versus... Yeah.
[334:43.43]No.
[334:45.43]Heavy weapons suck.
[334:47.29]Keep whatever you like.
[334:48.27]I like the fast weapons.
[334:50.92]But what about mining?
[334:52.04]Oh, you're right.
[334:52.70]Yeah, I forgot about the mining.
[334:54.26]That's true.
[334:56.24]That's true.
[335:00.02]What on Earth?
[335:13.14]This is interesting.
[335:21.38]How am I going to do this?
[335:42.41]Oh shit.
[335:54.60]I'm in trouble here.
[335:55.24]I don't think I can make it.
[336:02.58]Use the sword, the wooden sword.
[336:04.02]I just got it though.
[336:05.20]This thing's cool.
[336:09.69]This thing, I'm burning this thing.
[336:10.89]This thing's awesome.
[336:35.74]Hello?
[336:36.38]Got it.
[336:58.29]Frames are dropping.
[336:59.01]Frames are dropping.
[337:01.21]Honestly?
[337:08.64]I wonder why.
[337:10.92]Between 8 and 9 p.m.
[337:12.22]sometimes Pacific.
[337:14.28]And then it's fine.
[337:15.58]It's fine all day.
[337:16.42]It's fine after.
[337:18.36]I wonder what's going on.
[337:21.36]Well, I mean, all the EU fans will tell me this is the great idea to just stream an hour or two earlier.
[337:26.91]Best thing, higher traffic shouldn't matter.
[337:32.49]I have fiber.
[337:34.25]I have a gigabit line.
[337:36.73]I don't share a connection with anybody else.
[337:41.23]It shouldn't matter.
[337:42.35]I don't share a node with a neighborhood or anything.
[337:50.60]I do not share a node.
[337:54.52]Sorry, it's me chewing on your internet wire.
[337:56.24]Oh, well, stop.
[338:03.02]A giga line.
[338:04.68]Yeah, I have a giga chat line.
[338:16.78]Alright, let me move this.
[338:17.60]Is that correct?
[339:02.53]That was fun.
[339:21.18]I'm going to go turn in that main quest.
[339:25.53]Yeah, but it's super strange.
[339:27.49]I really don't really have an answer.
[339:32.23]Because technically speaking, in a technical sense, it's not like, oh, it's peak hours.
[339:39.50]It happens.
[339:40.98]It shouldn't be.
[339:41.52]Like I said, gigabit to... I have a gigabit to the street.
[339:47.42]So I don't... There's no sharing of the internet with the node or whatever.
[339:53.48]And it's perfect.
[339:54.82]It's bad for like 40 minutes between like 8, 20, and like 9.
[339:57.62]It's weird.
[340:02.70]Something with the way the traffic is hopping from like 8 p.m.
[340:08.42]to 9 p.m.
[340:10.02]It just hates it.
[340:10.80]I don't know.
[340:14.74]Well, I don't want to get upset about it.
[340:16.30]I know that I always go on these kind of tangents where it's like, I don't know.
[340:20.33]Let me tell you.
[340:21.03]Let's talk about it again.
[340:21.77]Let me go over like 40 straight minutes of why the internet's not.
[340:24.67]It's a good play.
[340:25.63]It's alright.
[340:26.27]It is what it is.
[340:35.89]It is what it is.
[340:39.45]It'll get better.
[340:43.31]Okay, here's the reward.
[340:47.77]That's a pretty good reward.
[341:04.03]See that statue?
[341:07.74]um I can't uh we can we move out of the way oh alright back when I was in high school we literally had squirrels munch on our lines
[341:35.25]That sucks, but that's like so funny for some reason.
[341:42.09]Yeah, I think I'm finally getting the hang of controlling this divine beast.
[341:50.04]I tell you what, sure is a blast piloting a toy like this around.
[341:55.54]Let those other champions know.
[341:57.24]They better eat their gravel if they want to keep up with the root.
[342:01.81]Speaking of which, can you believe this view?
[342:05.91]Just look at all those delectable rocks sprinkled on those mountains.
[342:10.79]Mighty tasty.
[342:13.86]I may not know a whole lot about this Calamity Ganon thing, but mark my words, I'll protect this land of ours to the death.
[342:22.66]Right, little guy?
[342:25.89]They could have killed me.
[342:26.65]Hey, by the way, congrats on becoming the princess's appointed knight.
[342:33.65]That's a really big deal, protecting the king's daughter.
[342:38.20]No pressure.
[342:41.70]Seriously, though, the princess is a strong personality.
[342:46.00]So strong, she can't quite see the range for the peaks.
[342:49.61]Remember that, and you'll be fine.
[343:13.41]Alright, so what was I saying?
[343:17.98]That was a little strange.
[343:20.06]As far as I know, Death Mountain has been quiet for decades.
[343:26.96]But if the mountain is shivering enough to send out a bunch of boulders that size, then never mind.
[343:32.92]Forget I said anything.
[343:50.58]What's gotten into you?
[344:04.23]Highly unsure or strange, anyway.
[344:05.65]You're actually a descendant of the great Daruk.
[344:08.49]That's why that slacker can even use Daruk's protection.
[344:15.46]He's to protect himself when we fire at Rudania.
[344:19.06]That's the only way we can chase that blasted beast away.
[344:23.36]We have no choice because normal cannonballs are no good against him.
[344:30.40]Alright, that's enough out of me.
[344:32.56]Time to go drive off Rudania.
[344:37.12]You okay?
[344:44.64]Yeah, just peachy.
[344:45.60]Dumb traveler, of course.
[344:46.56]I'm not okay.
[344:48.50]Oh, ow!
[344:49.48]I'm afraid I won't be going anywhere today.
[344:53.22]I hate to put you on the spot, but can you please go tell Yonobo that I'm going to have to cancel for today?
[344:59.56]You should be at Elden Bridge.
[345:02.29]Elden Bridge, alright.
[345:04.43]Let's go to Elden Bridge.
[345:08.75]Elden Bridge.
[345:11.75]Alright.
[345:16.15]Elden Ring?
[345:16.97]Cool.
[345:23.33]Let's do it.
[345:32.16]Simulation is breaking?
[345:33.30]What?
[345:35.60]Ah, you have frames.
[345:37.55]Internet.
[345:38.25]Frames.
[345:38.69]Internet.
[345:39.01]You know what I mean?
[345:41.13]Uh, should I buy some stuff before I go over here?
[345:45.30]I feel like I should purchase some stuff.
[345:47.88]Or am I just ready?
[345:48.92]Are you kidding me?
[345:50.00]Look at all this shit I have.
[345:50.74]Do you need more arrows?
[345:57.99]Should I get more arrows?
[345:59.51]I have 42 ice arrows.
[346:04.05]I think I'm alright.
[346:08.97]I'm just going to go for it.
[346:09.67]It's the quickest way over there.
[346:15.32]You can never have enough regular arrows.
[346:16.66]Well, I'll just buy some more then.
[346:17.56]Where's the store?
[346:27.63]Where is the general store?
[346:31.76]Alright, what do you got?
[346:39.38]Uh, you've got... You don't have regular arrows in here.
[346:45.29]Gain sugar?
[346:46.55]Um, sure.
[346:46.99]I'll take two.
[346:51.59]Spices?
[346:55.51]No regular arrows.
[346:56.19]Do you have arrows?
[347:03.00]At least free?
[347:04.14]No.
[347:10.80]Alright, let's go.
[347:17.07]What's the best way to get up there?
[347:19.79]Wrap around.
[347:23.43]Ooh, wait a second here.
[347:25.30]I've got... Guys!
[347:27.80]Heart or stamina?
[347:35.56]Stamina.
[347:36.64]I'll do stamina and heart.
[347:39.86]Stamina twice.
[347:50.80]How much longer are you going to stream for?
[347:52.14]I'll probably be calling it very soon.

[397:47.94]Okay, I'm gonna point at the fire.
[398:23.08]point of the fire what do you want to I don't get it there it is okay I've been every single mod told me the answer under a spoiler and I I don't I don't know if I want to click it I don't know if I'm gonna click it
[398:54.79]Point at the fire, but what do you mean by that?
[398:56.73]Point at the fire?
[399:03.31]How do you- Point at- Point at the fire, point at the fire.
[399:09.47]You don't mean look at this fire while I'm walking, right?
[399:12.08]Like as long as I have a fire in my field of view or something?
[399:40.86]Get out of the way!
[399:41.28]Get out of the way!
[399:41.66]Get out of the way!
[399:42.12]Get out of the way!
[399:48.09]I think I made it.
[399:48.57]Did I make it?
[399:48.97]I gotta turn around.
[399:59.98]I gotta turn my back to here.
[400:02.42]Turn my back!
[400:08.64]Don't look at it.
[400:10.36]Don't look at it.
[400:11.27]Don't look at it.
[400:12.51]I got so far.
[400:13.23]How did I get that far?
[400:13.87]I have to keep a fire in my field of view.
[400:45.83]Let me be very honest.
[400:48.05]When I play a game on my own on the couch, my ass sits there.
[400:52.95]And if I can't figure something out in two tries, I open up my iPad and I just go, How do you do the forest maze thing in Zelda Breath of the Wild?
[401:05.28]I don't even give it one second of time.
[401:11.29]How did I get that far last time, though?
[401:16.28]I'll give it, like, maybe three tries before I'm like, ah, nah, ah, what is it?
[401:20.04]How did I- I don't understand what I did this- this time.
[401:25.78]Do you- do you know what I mean?
[401:26.48]Like, how did I get over that far last time?
[401:28.42]What did I do differently?
[401:29.10]I have to point at it?
[401:30.86]I'm gonna lose my mind.
[401:37.81]Point at the fire.
[401:40.79]Guys, but there is no- I can't go, like- I don't know what that means.
[401:51.57]Point at the fire.

[405:24.04]Korok Forest.
[405:24.80]I made it.
[405:30.84]Wait, this is two frames a second.
[405:39.91]There it is!
[405:44.41]The toy that's at Walmart!
[405:53.18]Link.
[405:55.18]You are our final hope.
[405:58.50]The fate of Hyrule rests with you.
[406:05.13]You follow the fire's trail.
[406:08.15]What?
[406:11.59]The fire's trail?
[406:13.27]What are you talking about?
[406:14.51]Who is that?
[406:15.37]Did I doze off again?
[406:21.61]Well, well.
[406:24.76]The fire particles... Really?
[406:27.10]The ember's coming off the torch?
[406:28.62]No, you fucked up.
[406:29.73]You should have done a Dark Souls emote.
[406:46.47]you fucked up it should have been like Dark Souls fire Dark soulslike Dark Souls right I would have ember I would have been like oh shit okay I have watched over hyrule since time immemorial many have referred to me over the ages as the degu tree that is the weapon created by the ancient goddess
[407:10.99]The sword that seals the darkness that only the chosen knight can wield against the Calamity Ganon.
[407:18.54]Believe it or not, it was actually you who wielded that sword.
[407:27.12]Hold on, this is like a cool moment.
[407:28.70]Hold on a second.
[407:31.63]But I must warn you to take extreme caution.
[407:37.76]Oh, the jug was Elden Ring.
[407:39.22]The shard stands a test to anyone who would dare attempt to possess it.
[407:46.93]Dude, you need a break.
[407:54.75]if you sought to free the sword in any sort of weakened state you would surely lose your life where you stand tornado tenor dog tornado tornado dog dorito fire fire wind circle circle spin tornado
[408:25.31]I gotta read this.
[408:27.11]Tornado, tornado, dog, Dorito, fire, fire, wind, circle, circle, spin, tornado.
[408:31.79]Jesus Christ, man.
[408:45.36]That whole time, I actually just brute forced it, really.
[408:49.28]Dude, there was one point when I'm walking backwards and I almost made it.
[408:52.60]Dude, I almost made it walking backwards.
[408:55.22]I got to the stone.
[408:56.42]If I had just turned the right direction, I would have done it.
[408:58.59]Okay.
[409:12.00]Do I have enough power to pull the sword out?
[409:25.31]Am I strong enough?
[409:32.29]Are you kidding me?
[409:43.77]Link, why?
[409:57.28]heal up and try it?
[409:57.98]I have very highly doubt that.
[410:04.64]You probably need like a full thing.
[410:06.67]13 hearts.
[410:08.11]Do spirit hearts count?
[410:17.15]No.
[410:22.41]Complete the trials.
[410:24.55]That was fun.
[410:28.35]Oh my god.
[410:31.87]Um.
[410:33.39]No.
[410:34.11]Holy shit.
[410:34.79]Alright.
[410:37.33]I said I was going to turn the stream off at like 5.55.
[410:39.07]It's 6.50.
[410:39.38]I did that for an hour.
[410:42.26]No, I didn't.
[410:42.82]Did I not do that for an hour?
[410:46.36]That was not a full hour, was it?
[410:47.82]That was a holy shit.
[410:54.94]Tornado, tornado, Dorito.
[410:56.12]What was the Dorito thing?
[410:57.56]Why Doritos?
[410:59.45]Okay, here's the problem.
[411:02.33]And this is the problem that I had with emote-only mode.
[411:04.95]And people were like, dude, how come you didn't figure that out?
[411:06.97]Like, what the fuck?
[411:07.99]You couldn't figure out that you had to mirror the thing?
[411:10.08]Because I look over at chat and I make up a scenario that is not even close.
[411:14.90]Like, oh, Dorito, Dorito, tornado.
[411:16.82]Alright, so that means, like, there's a piece of cheese on the ground that I pick up and I throw into a tornado.
[411:22.48]I'm just making it way harder.
[411:24.20]I'm throwing myself off.
[411:32.80]But what was the... The Dorito was supposed to be Dorito dust?
[411:36.72]Dorito dust are embers.
[411:38.20]Yeah, I never would have gotten that.
[411:40.07]I never would have got that.
[411:51.77]There's no way in my brain seeing a Dorito chip in the chat is, oh, that's embers or dust.
[411:58.92]No, no, no.
[411:59.28]To me, that's a Dorito.
[412:00.32]That's cheese.
[412:02.10]Or like, like junk food or like fatty food, Dorito, cheese.
[412:09.62]If there was a, okay, there was a Cheeto emote, like a flaming hot Cheeto emote, I would understand.
[412:16.18]Like, like Cheeto fingers, right?
[412:22.11]Oh, I thought we were just spamming the Dorito for no reason.
[412:33.17]Oh, that's so stupid.
[412:34.84]I'm glad I did it without even knowing.
[412:38.46]I thought it was an arrow.
[412:42.12]Alright.
[412:42.88]Alright.
[412:43.36]That's it.
[412:43.74]I'm getting out of here.
[412:47.27]That's what I was posting in spoilers.
[412:48.77]Hold on.
[412:49.35]Let me see what the mods were writing.
[412:55.79]Okay, so, yeah, I wind fire sparkles goal.
[413:03.27]I got, I would not, okay, I would not have gotten that.
[413:06.41]I gust fire sparkle goal.
[413:10.72]It was the goal thing was fucking me up too.
[413:13.22]The like fire goal, goal, goal.
[413:16.36]It's like, what do you mean goal?
[413:19.00]Do the shrine?
[413:19.56]Alright, I'll do the shrine.
[413:27.27]I'll do this rhyme.
[413:29.71]And that's it.
[413:35.81]Oh, you made a bed?
[413:37.89]Oh, yeah.
[413:38.39]Look at my hearts.
[413:55.52]Back to emote-only mode.
[414:06.29]well now there's no doubt the stream title is accurate that's right yeah alright look where's the shrine I'll deal with all this later
[414:40.56]Wanna do one more bet?
[414:43.22]Yeah, so see?
[414:43.94]See, look at this.
[414:45.36]Uh, the drop frames have stopped as of, like, 30 minutes ago, right?
[414:48.94]I don't- I don't understand.
[414:49.82]What's this, like, Satan hour?
[414:51.63]Between, like, 8.15 and 9.15.
[414:53.05]I don't understand.
[414:54.85]Why is it, like, a Satanic hour where, like, the internet just doesn't work?
[414:58.89]But I'm not disconnected or anything.
[415:00.17]I'm not- Usually I would have lots of other problems.
[415:02.43]I just don't have any.
[415:04.61]Back when I would have actual frame problems, back when I, you know, uh, at the old place, it was-
[415:12.58]I would be dropping frames and the chat would stop.
[415:15.10]It'd be like, oh, my internet is messed up, right?
[415:20.24]So I have no idea.
[415:21.54]It's bizarre.
[415:22.00]I don't want you to guess this.
[415:26.20]I don't want you to see it.
[415:26.80]It's too late.
[415:36.35]And what was the shush?
[415:39.13]That was throwing me off big time too.
[415:40.91]The shh, shh, quiet, shush.
[415:44.47]What does that mean?
[415:45.71]What was that supposed to mean?
[415:46.65]The shh.
[415:49.49]How is that embers off of the flame?
[415:51.67]It's shh, quiet.
[415:56.57]Wait, starting three, two, one, start.
[416:04.34]Look to the stars for guidance.
[416:05.76]The constellations are the key.
[416:15.22]It gave me a headache.
[416:18.96]I get it.
[417:04.97]1, 2, 3, 4, 5?
[417:05.21]Alright, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 on either side.
[417:39.84]uh okay um that's okay this is the little dipper so little dipper is at the bottom over there a little dipper over here I don't know I don't know what it's trying to tell me um okay so
[418:19.40]Okay, I have an idea.
[418:29.61]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[418:32.45]Fuck.
[418:33.69]Wrong.
[418:45.40]I don't understand what the placement is for.
[418:47.66]There's no number.
[418:48.36]There's no coordinator.
[418:49.22]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 dots?
[418:56.44]That one's over on the left.
[418:57.83]Does that matter?
[418:58.31]I don't know if this matters or not.
[419:02.71]This one is over here.
[419:03.69]And it's over there.
[419:13.97]And then there's one, two, three, four, five.
[419:16.07]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[419:32.11]Hold on a second.
[419:33.93]This one is... Okay, it's... What does that mean?
[419:41.19]That's the correct one.
[419:41.93]Well, so what do I do with that?
[419:42.67]What do I do about that?
[419:44.14]This is the right one right here.
[419:45.28]That's the correct one.
[419:45.88]What does that mean?
[419:46.68]I don't know what that means.
[419:52.16]I know how to do it.
[419:56.27]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[419:58.15]Alright.

[420:59.48]Is there a chest?
[421:02.88]Oh, shit.
[421:03.76]Okay, hold on.
