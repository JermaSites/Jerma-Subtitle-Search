[00:29.12]Hi.
[00:31.10]Hey everybody, how are you?
[00:34.06]Welcome to the stream.
[00:34.86]Hope you're doing well, hope you're doing good.
[00:37.86]Did I spell Chris Redfield right?
[00:41.67]That's important question number one.
[00:44.29]Did I spell his name right?
[00:51.95]No, I didn't.
[00:52.43]What do you mean I didn't?
[00:53.13]How do you spell Redfield?
[00:54.08]Isn't it Redfield, right?
[01:00.39]No.
[01:04.93]I got it right.
[01:08.16]It's Christopher.
[01:10.46]Anyway, sorry I wasn't live yesterday.
[01:12.54]I wasn't feeling that great internally.
[01:16.26]And I still am not feeling that great.
[01:18.62]But, you know, as George Lucas once said, the show must go on.
[01:27.90]So tonight we're gonna do, uh, at least we're gonna start.
[01:31.67]I'm not sure if we'll finish it or not.
[01:32.85]I don't even know how long it is.
[01:33.75]Uh, we're gonna do the Resident Evil 7 DLC campaign.
[01:40.38]Coming at you, Redfield.
[01:41.36]What?
[01:42.58]I don't even know what it's called.
[01:43.44]What's up, Mike?
[01:46.02]It's called, like, A Day in the Life of Chris Redfield.
[01:50.02]I don't even know what the fucking name... I don't know what the name of this DLC is.
[01:58.04]I have no fucking idea.
[02:02.81]Not feeling well?
[02:03.65]Better use VR.
[02:04.69]Well, it's not, it's, look, it's not, it's not a puke sickness.
[02:07.57]It's kind of the other, you know, I don't have to, use your imagination.
[02:11.77]Don't, don't imagine me doing that.
[02:13.37]Just, you, you know, that's a term of, that's a term of phrase, you know.
[02:18.66]My lips are all chapped.
[02:19.58]I'm gonna ruin my fucking hair again.
[02:22.70]I can't wait.
[02:25.12]No.
[02:26.69]The Christmas decoration stream is going to be next week.
[02:36.18]So probably like Tuesday or Thursday next week is the Christmas decoration stream.
[02:41.61]Should be fun.
[02:44.48]I did not see Star Wars.
[02:48.19]Just cut the shit.
[02:51.37]I can't even see chat anyways.
[02:53.37]So remember, I'm going to have a VR helmet on the whole time.
[02:56.27]So I won't be able to see your comments about Star Wars anyway.
[03:02.92]Confirmed Friday Christmas stream.
[03:05.14]That's kind of how it works around here, isn't it?
[03:08.48]But this is Resident Evil 7 DLC.
[03:11.38]I don't know what to expect.
[03:13.22]We've pretty much played all the DLC.
[03:17.08]So might as well give this one a try too.
[03:18.53]It just came out like two days ago or yesterday or something.
[03:22.79]And I'm going to get myself in here.
[03:25.39]I'm going to go in.
[03:26.53]Hopefully I can hear this.
[03:30.38]I can't.
[03:30.76]It's really loud.
[03:32.34]So I will not be able to see any bits or anything like that for the remainder of the stream.
[03:36.72]Maybe I'll take a break and take a look in a minute.
[03:38.78]Yes, there will be a face cam.
[03:39.76]In fact, you're about to see it in about five, in about four, in about three, in about two.
[03:44.90]Two.
[03:48.30]Have I really?
[03:49.72]That's interesting to me that I've actually been sitting here holding this.
[03:53.40]Because remember, my face cam there takes the last image that was possibly recorded.
[04:00.30]So I've been sitting here going like this for like at least 30 minutes.
[04:04.52]That's kind of insane.
[04:06.45]Is that too bright?
[04:07.17]Is this like too bright?
[04:07.91]Should I turn the exposure down?
[04:09.15]Is this going to be fucking annoying to you guys?
[04:10.65]All right, well, whatever.
[04:13.85]Chris Redfield presents Welcome to Hell.
[04:21.95]Oh, it's a black shirt.
[04:23.55]This is actually a Star Wars shirt.
[04:26.70]I haven't seen the movie.
[04:27.90]Don't talk about the movie otherwise.
[04:30.75]You know, see ya.
[04:32.55]You're going to be out of here.
[04:35.07]VR balding stream.
[04:35.81]Yeah, pretty much.
[04:37.01]All right, let me get in here.
[04:37.70]Let me get in.
[04:38.74]Let me be fucking careful.
[04:40.88]God damn it, man.
[04:42.10]Let me make sure.
[04:43.24]Is everything in sync?
[04:45.88]Let me test something here.
[04:47.72]Ready?
[04:47.93]Let's go with.
[04:49.51]I am going down, up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down.
[04:57.07]Is that synced up?
[04:58.01]Because I'm not going to be able to fucking take it off for like an hour.
[05:03.38]How are we doing?
[05:07.18]Does it look good?
[05:09.36]Synced?
[05:09.66]Good sync?
[05:11.02]Good.
[05:12.14]Took me like six hours to get that to work.
[05:16.01]And... Engage!
[05:19.77]Fucking goddammit.
[05:20.99]My hair is too long for this.
[05:33.19]Okay, we're good there.
[05:36.69]That's good.
[05:39.21]Put that there.
[05:44.75]Alright, I don't need to do this.
[05:46.93]It's a little tight.
[05:48.04]That's a little tight, but it's alright.
[05:50.48]Okay.
[05:51.98]Let's get out of this.
[05:52.96]I need to put it down here.
[05:53.74]Alright, welcome to Resident Evil VR!
[05:58.50]One, two, three, four, five.
[06:01.30]Are we in sync?
[06:02.16]Good.
[06:06.57]I just want to make sure this is working.
[06:09.37]Watch it not even be fucking capturing.
[06:11.63]I'm just sitting here looking at my fucking two hands I don't even have here.
[06:14.39]Alright.
[06:15.29]Start game.
[06:16.07]Fly up.
[06:19.21]Fly is down.
[06:20.29]Fly is down.
[06:21.95]We're good.
[06:22.41]Now it is.
[06:22.79]Now we're good.
[06:24.67]Not a hero.
[06:26.27]Here we go.
[06:29.05]Fly was down.
[06:34.83]He's waiting for the movie to start.
[06:41.46]Don't even got any fucking previews?
[06:43.72]What kind of fucking game is it?
[06:46.02]You don't even got any free previews?
[06:49.43]Where's the new... Where's the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie they're gonna make, like, five more times?
[06:56.25]There it is!
[06:58.25]Not a hero.
[06:59.99]Start a new game.
[07:02.37]Difficulty.
[07:05.25]No.
[07:07.37]Is this too loud?
[07:11.96]Is this too loud?
[07:15.99]What do you guys think?
[07:23.43]Too loud?
[07:24.09]Alright.
[07:25.73]Fucking company!
[07:31.29]What the fuck was that?
[07:32.41]That's the best thing I've seen in Resident Evil 7 and we just started.
[07:39.70]No, it's this guy.
[07:48.96]Okay, so this takes place somewhere between Episode 7 and Episode 8, right?
[07:53.65]From my understanding.
[07:57.51]Here's the end of A New Hope.
[08:03.72]And that, see, this is the Ewok village.
[08:13.85]Sounds like a pretty good 80s band, The Connections.
[08:18.87]You get one.
[08:19.47]I get one at the beginning of every stream.
[08:21.65]You guys know that.
[08:24.23]So I'm gonna clear out the house, right?
[08:26.59]I get one terrible fucking joke at the beginning of every stream, and if you don't tell me, I don't.
[08:30.87]That's horseshit.
[08:33.97]How do you play the game?
[08:34.75]Because I forget, it's been like six months.
[08:39.70]What the fuck does that say?
[08:45.14]Umbrella HMD systems.
[08:47.48]Okay.
[08:47.88]Yeah, I remember this part.
[08:49.98]Start of the mine, great.
[09:03.04]Signal lost.
[09:04.18]Alright.
[09:08.85]I remember it's... I thought we already had a monster.
[09:13.11]How do I put the gun down?
[09:15.41]I actually kind of do like this Soldier 76 face that I got going on here.
[09:21.40]That's Zenayata.
[09:22.18]I don't even play that fucking game.
[09:24.44]Why am I making those references?
[09:26.68]It's called being scared already and not wanting to deal with the fact that I have to fight monsters now.
[09:36.46]R2 is shoot, right?
[09:38.48]If I remember correctly here.
[09:45.16]I don't like this mist.
[09:48.10]They got like cameras up there.
[09:49.34]They're going to get my reaction and put it on like a fucking daytime ABC show.
[09:56.86]I got the jokes tonight.
[09:58.02]I do.
[09:59.29]Actually, I kind of do.
[10:10.36]You can punch enemies when they stagger.
[10:12.04]Just like Chris Redfield can, right?
[10:14.80]That's his special move.
[10:16.30]I already did this as another character, didn't I?
[10:23.58]Oh, fuck.
[10:25.88]Hey!
[10:26.56]Already.
[10:26.88]I knew there was somebody there.
[10:30.60]What is it?
[10:31.26]R2?
[10:31.39]What is it?
[10:32.07]What's punch?
[10:45.11]Oh, God damn it.
[10:46.41]Punch him?
[10:47.03]How do I punch him?
[10:48.55]Oh, shit.
[10:54.72]His final breath.
[10:56.52]I, like, didn't even get it.
[10:57.44]How do I punch him?
[11:00.86]He just, like, fucking pancaked in front of me.
[11:03.40]He was about to say his last line, his going out.
[11:07.00]I'm going to give you my one-liner, and he just couldn't do it.
[11:10.00]He's just like, I'm going to say it.
[11:11.20]No, I'm not.
[11:17.53]Any idea what Lucas is up to down here?
[11:20.39]We're still analyzing the data, but it looks like he's been running experiments with an E-type of eutemycete.
[11:25.81]Let's hope those men haven't become a part of those experiments.
[11:29.10]When is this supposed to take place during the game?
[11:30.56]You know what I mean?
[11:35.24]Like, at what point in the game is this?
[11:41.14]By the way, this is free.
[11:42.70]You were wondering.
[11:44.39]This is a free DLC campaign.
[11:47.23]That's probably only gonna be like an hour and five minutes.
[11:51.11]But it was free!
[11:52.97]We can't complain about things when they're free.
[12:00.94]I hear something.
[12:02.90]No, it's just me.
[12:03.66]Okay, we're good.
[12:08.36]Up the stairs, I would assume.
[12:12.92]I can't think of the last thing I could complain about that was free.
[12:17.80]Let me think here.
[12:18.68]What can you complain about that's free?
[12:22.85]Like somebody slapping you and like the mouth is free.
[12:24.91]So you don't want that.
[12:26.75]I guess you could complain about that.
[12:29.17]Door's gonna bust open.
[12:32.41]I already know that's gonna happen.
[12:34.13]Door is gonna burst the fuck open.
[12:36.87]Monster jumps out.
[12:39.85]Two in the head.
[12:41.63]One in the stomach.
[12:44.43]Fuck you, game.
[12:48.42]I know it's gonna fucking happen.
[12:49.50]I know it.
[12:52.46]Is that a good guy or a bad guy?
[13:07.97]That looks like a good guy.
[13:12.96]All right, what happened?
[13:14.66]What's going on here?
[13:15.86]I'm getting you out of here.
[13:17.96]This mask is going to come off and he's going to fucking get me.
[13:20.50]We're both walking out of here.
[13:22.40]I got news for you.
[13:23.88]What?
[13:24.56]That's not going to happen.
[13:26.50]Uh-oh.
[13:27.16]I wouldn't do that if I were you.
[13:28.63]Now, you can try and take that off all you want, but I'd advise against.
[13:37.07]My head might slip and... Lucas!
[13:41.31]I missed it.
[13:42.06]I wouldn't even look in the right spot.
[13:43.32]I wouldn't look in.
[13:43.96]How am I lying here?
[13:45.60]I'm like, huh?
[13:46.18]I have one of those battlefield necks.
[13:48.06]Fuck.

[14:39.35]Quickly!
[14:40.61]With the swiftness, get out of this room quickly!
[14:44.23]What's happening to my body?
[14:46.61]Why am I in critical fucking mass right now?
[14:48.49]Looks like you're clear of any contamination.
[14:52.18]Good.
[14:52.80]You should head back and get that bomb on your arm deactivated.
[14:55.46]There's no time.
[14:56.14]I don't want to give that asshole a head start.
[14:58.52]I'm alright.
[14:58.96]Understood.
[15:00.22]Just be careful.
[15:02.68]We gotta get the bomb.
[15:03.74]Okay, now I have multiple meters to worry about here.
[15:06.47]I've got health.
[15:07.97]I've got oxygen.
[15:10.67]It's monitoring my blood pressure.
[15:12.21]What else is it doing?
[15:18.68]Oh, god damn it.
[15:20.16]Of course.
[15:20.64]This is the bullshit schtick for this whole entire DLC.
[15:27.19]Don't run out of air.
[15:30.95]How do you punch?
[15:31.89]R2.
[15:31.97]There it is.
[15:36.34]Get it.
[15:36.76]Yeah, I know.
[15:42.56]Go down, go, go, go, go down.
[15:46.02]Can I hold my breath?
[15:50.67]Damn it.
[15:51.53]Goddamn, like, pitching meter.
[15:52.35]Was this MLB 2K fucking 16?
[15:53.07]No, it ain't.
[15:53.45]It ain't.
[16:18.22]They deleted that franchise, like, fucking two years ago.
[16:20.84]Oh, who cares about what I'm saying?
[16:27.75]Any more gas?
[16:32.73]Not quite.
[16:33.17]What else is over here?
[16:35.85]Somebody, like, remind me when... Is that a mine?
[16:40.13]Oh, you dumb fucking idiot.
[16:41.55]Like, what... I only have 11 bullets.
[16:46.19]Why would I do that?
[16:48.74]That's like a funny clown thing.
[16:50.80]What is going on here?
[16:56.36]Well, we're going to press the clown button.
[16:59.80]Oh, wait a minute.
[17:00.41]I don't understand.
[17:02.53]What is this?
[17:04.19]I do have... Okay, I have like old school Super Mario bombs.
[17:09.65]Med injector.
[17:10.27]I believe that's the new healing.
[17:15.24]Okay, that's cool.
[17:17.05]So down is the, what is this, the shotgun?
[17:20.91]I'm good for now.
[17:27.26]Whatever.
[17:30.38]So right is grenade, down is shotgun.
[17:35.78]Somebody behind me.
[17:38.06]I hear something, I don't know where they are.
[17:39.45]I think they're behind me and I'm fucking scared to look.
[17:42.13]No, we're good.
[17:44.43]Couple grenades.
[17:46.60]You guys hear this, right?
[17:47.44]I'm not insane.
[17:53.16]Is it me?
[17:55.91]Behind the drape.
[17:56.55]There's always a fucking monster behind the drape.
[18:01.23]No, that's heavy.
[18:02.05]I don't have any coins.
[18:03.81]Increasing max health.
[18:07.06]Three coins?
[18:08.94]Five coins?
[18:12.36]Speed and shit.
[18:13.74]I don't have any coins.
[18:19.92]No.
[18:21.00]No coins yet.
[18:24.56]That's fine.
[18:25.00]Let's go.
[18:25.42]I don't like how... Night vision device required.
[18:44.03]So I can't go in here yet.
[18:45.73]Can I?
[18:46.03]Oh!
[18:54.65]No, I can... Nope.
[18:58.73]No, that's not happening.
[19:00.75]I ain't doing that right now.
[19:02.99]Alright, so this is like pick a door.
[19:04.57]I have to beat all the doors.
[19:06.07]There's like three doors.
[19:07.21]Let's just go down here first, I guess.
[19:17.98]Wait, wasn't I... Was I already here?
[19:20.08]I think I already was here.
[19:27.47]No, I wasn't.
[19:29.57]Oh, this is some Saw-level shit right now.
[19:32.59]Jigsaw's gonna get on the fucking intercom and tell me about this guy's life and his, like, family and shit.
[19:38.05]No, that's gonna be, like, booby-trapped to the door or something.
[19:40.52]It's me.
[19:42.38]I guess not.
[19:46.90]It's gonna happen, though.
[19:48.60]You know it.
[20:09.05]What is this?
[20:09.49]Is it elevator?
[20:15.55]How we doing?
[20:18.01]He's a gaunt shi- I'm not gonna shoot him.
[20:20.43]Why would I shoot him?
[20:22.84]Why?
[20:25.54]We're good.
[20:26.34]Everything's fine.
[20:34.52]Somebody coming up there?
[20:35.74]Somebody in here now?
[20:36.84]What was that noise?
[20:42.76]There are train tracks here, which means like a train is gonna come and hit me.
[20:49.39]There's the key.
[20:51.53]It's not gonna be so easy with Lucas.
[20:53.71]He's gonna fuck with us and do a bunch of weird shit.
[21:01.48]Not as easy as it seems, no way.
[21:13.43]Oh, that's close!
[21:17.37]No, don't do it again!
[21:18.63]There's a lot of people coming.
[21:38.27]Don't do it.
[21:40.88]Where's my crosshair, dude?
[21:42.46]Why can I not see it?
[21:43.38]Where's my crosshair?
[21:55.65]Okay, how many more people are there?
[22:00.84]All right, I'm gonna go for one shot in the head.
[22:03.24]I wish I could see it on his body.
[22:08.95]Damn it.
[22:09.87]How do you block?
[22:10.43]I forget how you block.
[22:12.82]What did I just do?
[22:15.12]Oh, I don't fucking remember how to fucking block.
[22:17.86]It's L1.
[22:18.58]God damn it.
[22:20.18]That's a disaster right there.
[22:26.54]Where did they go?
[22:29.97]What?
[22:30.85]What the fuck was that?
[22:31.65]What the hell is going on here?
[22:32.61]Where did they go?
[22:46.36]They probably spawn forever.
[22:47.20]Give me the key.
[22:47.60]What is that?
[22:50.10]Where is it?
[22:50.48]Where is it?
[22:50.76]Where is it?
[22:51.04]Where is it?
[22:52.04]Where the fuck am I going?
[22:58.72]Get the fucking... No!
[23:02.08]Where is he?
[23:02.82]Where the fuck is this guy?
[23:04.18]Oh my god, he's underneath me.
[23:16.06]Are you done?
[23:16.56]No more bullets in here.
[23:32.70]How the hell am I gonna get up there?
[23:33.68]Is there like a button I can press?
[23:55.85]No.
[23:58.23]I don't have... You can't use this as is.
[24:00.27]I need a crank.
[24:02.13]Of course I do.
[24:02.85]I don't have a key or anything.
[24:10.57]So there's a clown door.
[24:11.97]I don't have what's necessary to open the clown door right now.
[24:17.30]We're going to go down here.
[24:29.25]I wish I could see where the hell I was going.
[24:34.55]Oh, there it is.
[24:36.55]There's a gear.
[24:42.38]That should bring this down, right?
[24:46.08]Theoretically.
[24:47.46]Theoretically.
[24:53.18]Forgot about these.
[24:57.41]Gun ammo.
[25:00.09]Let's go ahead and load that.
[25:05.75]Crank.
[25:08.21]Should go here.
[25:08.82]Hmm, there's another piece.
[25:15.00]I need something else.
[25:15.82]I need an actual crank.
[25:19.08]Well, fuck.
[25:24.75]This needs to be adjusted.
[25:25.89]Give me one moment.
[25:29.17]That's better.
[25:34.77]Nothing else over this way.
[25:35.81]Oh, there's a grenade.
[25:39.21]I'll take it.
[25:47.01]Have to check all of your surroundings because there could be something else here.
[25:51.07]What the fuck is this guy?
[26:03.44]Coin.
[26:10.03]Is the crank not in here?
[26:11.19]Is it not in this room?
[26:19.28]Can I take it off of this or something?
[26:20.92]I can't, like, rip it off of here?
[26:28.66]Okay, well, there it is.
[26:34.70]Okie dokie.
[26:36.26]Let's go turn it and get the key.
[26:42.77]This ought to do it.
[26:45.92]Oh no.
[26:50.00]What is going on over there?
[26:51.68]It just made him.
[26:55.22]That thing is huge.
[26:57.44]Oh, it's one of those huge guys.
[27:02.84]Why did I shoot it?
[27:03.48]Now it knows where I am!
[27:04.28]Now it knows where I am!
[27:12.15]Oh man, I don't like it.
[27:14.11]I don't like it.
[27:15.03]I don't like it.
[27:16.73]I don't like it.
[27:17.69]Just give me the key.
[27:29.72]I'm gonna throw a grenade in his mouth.
[27:36.43]Watch this.
[27:38.31]Prime time, right in his mouth.
[27:56.31]Get me out of here.
[27:57.43]Get me out of here.
[27:58.77]I just like dunked it up his head.
[28:06.50]I don't think I have to kill that guy.
[28:11.32]I don't have to kill that guy.
[28:28.89]I just hit that guy in the face with a snowball.
[28:32.45]I should have held it down for longer.
[28:33.69]I kind of want to go kill that guy though.
[28:36.29]An interesting enemy.
[28:43.07]Whatever.
[28:43.35]He might drop something.
[28:47.13]Let's get him.
[28:49.33]I'll get him with this shit.
[28:53.32]Look, I just have to like crouch.
[28:56.51]I'm gonna get the grenade queued up and I'm gonna hit him right in the face with a grenade snowball and it's gonna blow his fucking head off.
[29:04.40]Nah, he's just like a trapdoor spider, that's fine.
[29:18.22]No, what the fuck?!
[29:19.54]Why?! !
[29:22.85]Fuck off.
[29:23.47]That's bullshit.
[29:24.37]Can I do-
[29:53.72]They go two grenades.
[29:57.35]I fucking... Trying to be, like, funny, and I, like, wasted fucking health and two grenades.
[30:04.25]Actually, four grenades.
[30:06.62]Great.
[30:08.56]Well, that's just great.
[30:11.08]I don't need them.
[30:12.70]They're a crutch.
[30:15.26]Alright, got the cell key.
[30:16.38]Let's make sure we open this, and then the bomb booby trap explodes.
[30:24.88]No, no trap triggered?
[30:25.98]That like blew his face off?
[30:27.25]Okay.
[30:32.45]What's up?
[30:32.77]I gotta pick which color to do.
[30:36.57]Oh.
[30:36.65]I only got like a 95.
[30:37.35]Take the filter.
[30:55.76]There's got to be another way.
[31:01.96]Your arms are just tied up.
[31:03.16]You're fine.
[31:05.00]I tried.
[31:06.42]Wow.
[31:06.66]Oh, get it!
[31:24.10]Get his mask!
[31:27.43]Chris, put it on!
[31:28.95]Chris, put his mask on!
[31:31.03]Put it on!
[31:44.94]High-grade filter.
[31:50.58]Now you have a high-grade filter.
[31:52.61]means your contamination filter has been upgraded.
[31:54.62]Now you can't get affected by the dusty snow.
[31:58.02]That's great.
[31:58.66]Congratulations.
[32:01.38]Thanks, buddy.
[32:03.42]I will never forget you.
[32:11.66]You gotta check everything.
[32:13.74]Gotta check everything.
[32:23.02]We're good.
[32:29.22]Okay, so now what does that mean?
[32:30.44]I think I might be able to go up the stairs.
[32:36.48]My lips are so dry.
[32:37.64]It's like really, really bothering me.
[32:40.88]I need to like just have like a glass of water to stick my mouth in and do like a duck face in it.
[32:44.48]Let's go back up.
[32:53.97]Air cleaner.
[32:56.63]Clean air.
[32:58.61]Wait.
[33:03.82]That fucking huge guy is here, isn't he?
[33:07.80]Oh, great.
[33:14.77]There were other doors down there that I could go in.
[33:16.81]I'm gonna go back down.
[33:21.65]I'm not coming here yet.
[33:22.67]I'm not coming here unless I need to.
[33:28.27]Nope.
[33:35.50]So wait, now this whole place is contaminated.
[33:40.22]Interesting.
[33:40.76]Another coin.
[33:45.82]I get three coins and I get more max health, right?
[33:50.44]I believe so.
[34:02.03]I can't wait to give my hand to that asshole.
[34:04.27]Just remember we need him alive, Chris.
[34:07.01]Yeah, yeah.
[34:08.88]I don't think I have a key or anything for this.
[34:11.92]No, I got two coins, though.
[34:14.30]I didn't go up here.
[34:15.04]There's a save point and a trunk.
[34:18.40]Let's save it.
[34:25.21]This has been pretty intense so far.
[34:27.45]How we doing, guys?
[34:29.37]How we doing?
[34:32.06]Oh, hold on.
[34:33.82]I can't see.
[34:41.06]Chat is better than the game?
[34:42.47]Wait, what do you mean?
[34:44.55]What happened?
[34:51.85]Auto stream?
[34:54.83]Game sucks?
[35:07.00]No, what do you mean next?
[35:08.24]Are you serious?
[35:11.77]Are you actually serious?
[35:13.05]Next?
[35:17.13]We've only been playing this for like fucking 30 minutes.
[35:23.83]No, I'm beating this.
[35:25.60]This is what we're doing tonight.
[35:28.94]And we're also going to play one of the dumb VR games.
[35:30.82]I have VR plugged in.
[35:31.78]That's what we're doing.
[35:32.66]I'm going back in.
[35:34.06]I'm going back in.
[35:37.23]Everyone's saying, you know what, I thought everybody liked Resident Evil.
[35:42.03]Next.
[35:44.99]No, this is what I'm doing.
[35:53.20]Why the fuck do I need these?
[35:54.24]Alright, we're good.
[35:59.18]Fucking next.
[36:04.53]No, I ain't next.
[36:06.17]This is only like an hour and 45 minute campaign.
[36:13.95]So I can't... I don't know what I have to do here.
[36:16.85]There's only like really two ways to go.
[36:22.73]No, there's not.
[36:23.11]There's another door here.
[36:24.59]Magic fucking doors.
[36:25.85]I tried that one.
[36:26.57]Is this the one I came in?
[36:28.27]Let's see what the fuck is in here.
[36:32.17]No, I gotta go in this one.
[36:36.75]Alright, it begins again.
[36:37.63]Here we go.
[36:38.23]Oh, fuck.
[36:47.39]I already don't like this.
[36:57.50]I'm so glad you can do this and just stand all the way back and the game still thinks you're moving your hands over there.
[37:02.52]It's perfect.
[37:08.79]Nothing.
[37:14.53]Yeah, there's a tower of terror.
[37:15.61]I can't even say it.
[37:16.76]Tower of terror elevator.
[37:17.92]Got this door here.
[37:25.46]And this door here.
[37:31.71]Requires a key.
[37:32.67]Looks like we're going this way.
[37:39.23]What is going on here?
[37:40.79]Is this place cold?
[37:45.21]No, I needed the enhanced version.
[37:47.65]I needed a warmer mask.
[37:59.32]It's locked.
[38:03.64]Watch out for the bad guys.
[38:04.62]They're going to come down here in a second.
[38:07.53]Traps?
[38:07.93]No.
[38:12.36]One of these mummies is going to get up and freak out.
[38:15.19]It's going to be a scare.
[38:25.67]I can't see that far.
[38:31.68]What is... Target unaffected.
[38:35.74]What are you talking about here?
[38:36.92]Oh, come on.
[38:38.88]I can't...
[38:40.82]What?
[38:41.64]What are you supposed to do with this guy?
[38:44.18]What are you supposed to do with this guy?
[38:46.24]What?
[38:49.16]What, do I have to run him out to the front yard?
[38:57.67]What is it?
[38:58.29]Hold on a second.
[39:02.17]I need to open up my inventory.
[39:08.79]Find three missing soldiers.
[39:09.99]I found one.
[39:10.55]Where's my inventory?
[39:12.43]No, not the stupid fucking PS share button.
[39:17.29]There it is.
[39:24.38]I can't kill anything.
[39:32.17]This fucking thing can't die.
[39:38.92]I want to put this... Why can't I put this here?
[39:45.11]I don't fucking know.
[39:48.05]I don't know exactly what to do here.
[39:49.35]I think I have to run by them.
[39:50.77]Bullets can't hurt these guys.
[39:51.97]I'm going to try running by them.
[40:01.36]Let's just go right through them.
[40:13.44]I just got scared by the box moving.
[40:18.02]Is the guy even here anymore?
[40:20.69]I think I actually lost that guy.
[40:22.83]As weird as that sounds.
[40:23.67]It's going to show up again though.
[40:29.96]Just fucking watch.
[40:35.68]Hmm.
[40:36.56]Down here.
[40:43.18]Find the three missing soldiers.
[40:45.89]I wonder where missing soldier number two is gonna be.
[40:59.16]Shit.
[41:06.78]There he is again.
[41:07.74]You just have to fucking lose him.
[41:10.45]I have the stun grenades, but I can't even equip them because I have too much shit on me, apparently.
[41:15.84]Oh, God.
[41:16.66]Fuck you, man.
[41:27.40]How do I take this shit off?
[41:37.30]How do I, like, remove this?
[41:44.00]I want... I... Can I not move this out?
[41:50.60]That's how you do it, right?
[41:53.64]Like, maybe I just can't... Apparently I can't fucking put these on here for some reason because I'm a moron.
[42:02.26]Fucking idiot.
[42:06.49]It's been like six months since I've last played this game.
[42:08.85]Come on.
[42:09.17]Give me a little bit of a break here.
[42:14.77]Can these break?
[42:18.32]No.
[42:21.24]I'm gonna stun grenade him and we're gonna run by.
[42:22.68]That's the strategy.
[42:28.77]And then I'm gonna unlock the night vision and I'm gonna be able to go to the night town.
[42:51.04]God damn it.
[42:51.70]I hate this shit.
[42:52.50]I hate these little hallways.
[42:56.00]Where is he?
[42:56.32]I don't know where he is.
[42:57.48]I don't know.
[42:59.04]In front of me?
[43:00.04]Is he behind me?
[43:00.60]Please don't be behind me.
[43:01.49]Is he behind me, guys?
[43:03.55]He's behind me, isn't he?
[43:04.23]No, he's not.
[43:09.69]No, I wanted to punch him!
[43:11.30]I wanted to punch him!
[43:28.03]I wanted to punch him in the back.
[43:35.02]Night vision device, there it is.
[43:36.30]I don't know what the fuck that shit is.
[43:43.90]Healing, anti-regen ammo.
[43:47.64]I just had a dramatic go for it over here.
[43:58.71]All right, so let me get this straight.
[44:04.11]Anti-regen ammo.
[44:08.57]Press L1 plus... Okay, so here we go.
[44:20.01]What is it?
[44:20.43]How do you do this shit?
[44:21.89]L2.
[44:22.03]All right, so here's the anti-regen ammo, right?
[44:28.46]I gotta make these count.
[44:30.41]Except I don't think I want to even kill this guy.
[44:33.67]Why would I use it here?
[44:34.55]I don't think I'm going to use it here, guys.
[44:36.75]Don't think so.
[44:40.43]I have the night vision device.
[44:41.47]I can get out of here.
[44:44.33]The game desperately wants me to shoot this guy with the anti-regen ammo, but I'm not going to do it.
[44:49.50]I want to save it.
[44:53.82]But when I actually really need it.
[44:59.88]Like right now.
[45:00.76]I'm probably gonna need it right now.
[45:02.32]So.
[45:10.92]Why is it so dark?
[45:11.58]Turn on the night vision, man.
[45:15.50]Oh.
[45:16.20]God.
[45:17.28]Damn it.
[45:22.65]Free shit.
[45:23.73]Secret room.
[45:34.83]Is this gonna kill me?
[45:46.55]No.
[45:52.20]I need to heal.
[45:59.87]Actually, I kind of don't like this, the HUD now.
[46:03.15]You see, it's really just getting in the way.
[46:07.14]It's sort of just in my face.
[46:09.72]And I'd like to be able to see what I'm doing.
[46:19.99]So I don't need the night vision anymore, apparently.
[46:27.39]Go up.
[46:29.87]There's no power.
[46:30.53]Of course not.
[46:37.26]Why would there be power?
[46:38.22]God damn it.
[46:53.05]Oh, that sucks.
[46:55.03]Back into night vision land.
[46:58.89]Turn it back on, please.
[47:03.29]Good thing I got voice controls.
[47:08.59]Where did I not go?
[47:14.47]Here, apparently.
[47:15.35]I'm gonna turn this shit on and monsters are gonna appear out of nowhere.
[47:26.72]One, two, three.
[47:34.29]Are these fucking things on?
[47:38.37]No, they're red.
[47:47.18]They look green from the side here.
[47:57.23]Go, quick!
[48:00.55]No, don't use the anti-tank!
[48:04.67]God damn it!
[48:11.07]Where is it?
[48:31.45]Get out!
[48:42.51]Back!
[48:43.81]Back, you little shit!
[48:45.41]Get back!
[48:49.47]Alright, we're good.
[48:55.11]Got the night vision goggles.
[49:03.51]One, two, three, go.
[49:17.19]Oh yeah, you got him.
[49:20.35]That's so impressive, Jeremy.
[49:22.38]You got him.
[49:27.56]Wait, I can get him with this.
[49:28.70]The non-regeneration allowed weapon.
[49:35.34]He's dead, right?
[49:37.00]He's dead, right?
[49:39.28]I shot him with the you're not allowed to regenerate weapon, right?
[49:43.34]Should I say right after everything I say?
[49:44.92]Right?
[49:46.16]What the fuck is that thing?
[49:57.53]Huh?
[49:59.63]Why do I hear more sounds?
[50:15.46]Why are you...
[50:19.65]Stun grenade.
[50:20.25]Ready?
[50:20.47]Watch.
[50:20.80]This is gonna work.
[50:21.40]Stun grenade.
[50:24.54]That didn't fucking work.
[50:25.86]It does work.
[50:30.72]Why does that not work?
[50:34.73]Why does that not...
[51:01.06]It's a fucking video camera.
[51:10.34]Just had to crouch.
[51:11.76]How was I?
[51:13.00]Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[51:16.62]Wait a minute, no.
[51:17.16]I can just do that.
[51:29.99]Just keep doing that.
[51:31.13]There's going to be a couple more that come out, guaranteed.
[51:32.96]Look at the way I'm sitting.
[51:45.00]Okay, get me out.
[51:49.52]Another regenerator?
[51:58.14]Exit.
[51:59.54]See you later.
[52:05.40]Ah, hey.
[52:08.97]Those aren't regenerators, right?
[52:10.31]No.
[52:16.07]Oh, boy.
[52:20.75]Why?
[52:21.51]Wait.
[52:24.74]Where the fuck?
[52:30.85]firing squad.
[52:33.00]How am I supposed to get over there?
[52:47.54]I'll go this way.
[52:50.58]Do I have to use their bodies as cover?
[52:59.93]Probably.
[53:04.27]Probably, you know, that's what I have to do.
[53:08.09]That's what I have to do.
[53:12.17]And I think I blew it.
[53:15.09]Yeah, I have to wait until they get shot at and then I have to walk.
[53:19.57]It's alright, I blew it.
[53:24.68]Anybody else?
[53:28.24]Fucking blew it.
[53:29.38]God damn it.
[53:30.24]Well, alright, bye.
[53:36.08]You gonna spawn me another one?
[53:36.94]Give me another one.
[53:37.45]Spawn me another one.
[53:40.41]There's probably a secret up there too and shit that I just can't get now.
[53:43.19]It's annoying.
[53:47.63]Wait, did it... I already did this.
[53:53.61]No, I didn't.
[53:57.81]Why are these all here now?
[53:59.87]I don't understand.
[54:00.45]Why the fuck are these all here?
[54:03.72]Who planted these here?
[54:06.60]What was that guy?
[54:07.38]Richard.
[54:07.74]What was his name?

[55:52.59]I got the turkey.
[55:53.29]It's alright.
[55:58.92]Thank God.
[56:01.80]No, it's not a thank God situation because there's another red barrel.
[56:04.62]Why is there another red barrel?
[56:13.16]Yeah.
[56:14.86]Oh, God.
[56:22.28]That sucks.

[56:40.93]I'm dead.
[56:43.93]I'm dead.
[56:46.43]About dead.
[56:47.13]Alive still somehow.
[56:53.32]What were they?
[56:57.36]What were they?
[56:59.94]I can't get it.
[57:02.04]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[57:04.26]There's nowhere to go here.
[57:05.28]There's nowhere to go.
[57:05.92]There's nowhere to go here.
[57:09.26]I gotta do it.
[57:17.98]There's a bucket!
[57:29.20]Stupid fucking thing.
[57:30.82]Stupidest fucking thing ever.
[57:41.07]Where's that gonna put me?
[57:41.75]I don't even know.
[57:44.80]God damn it.
[57:50.08]I had one bullet.
[57:52.20]This right here.
[57:53.56]Now this is not even the right way to go.
[57:55.64]Did I already kill the turkey?
[57:56.63]Turkey's already dead.
[57:58.75]It's this one guy here.
[58:05.97]What am I doing?
[58:06.99]I already fucked it up again.
[58:13.44]Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly.
[58:15.08]You gotta do it now.
[58:15.99]You gotta do it now.
[58:16.93]You gotta do it now.
[58:17.75]I don't even know what I picked up.
[58:26.42]I have no idea.
[58:28.28]I don't know what that was.
[58:29.44]Guy around the corner.
[58:30.12]Right here.
[58:30.38]3, 2, 1.
[58:40.85]I have no bullets for this.
[58:42.35]I don't have time for this.
[58:43.99]Go.
[58:44.53]Get out.
[58:45.05]Get out.
[58:45.55]Get out.
[58:45.93]Go.
[58:46.11]I don't have time for this shit.
[58:48.15]There's the secret right there.
[58:49.13]I missed it.
[58:53.12]Out.
[58:54.04]Out, please.
[58:56.48]Out, please.
[58:59.32]I'm starting to get a fucking itchy head.
[59:20.61]Scared boy becomes brave boy.
[59:23.01]Alright, we're alright.
[59:31.84]There was no person there, though.
[59:33.80]Wasn't I looking for somebody?
[59:35.04]Like a second soldier?
[59:35.96]Well, I can already tell you that this next zone is going to be hell.
[59:41.85]It just is.
[59:48.31]I already know it's going to be obnoxious.
[59:50.37]It's going to be so terrible.
[59:53.81]Night vision only and people are going to be around every goddamn corner.
[60:00.08]It's not going to be a fun day.
[60:03.86]Very soon here.
[60:04.66]Let's get these.
[60:10.20]Where was that coin shop?
[60:18.65]This is a heal.
[60:23.35]Fully restores health.
[60:24.75]Anything else I don't need right now?
[60:26.63]Lockpick.
[60:30.03]Can I open that door with a lockpick?
[60:32.97]I wonder.
[60:35.13]I don't think you can.
[60:36.05]I'm pretty sure you can't.
[60:38.99]No.
[60:46.30]Just for shits, let me just see if I can break that lock.
[60:50.32]Where was that, over here?
[60:51.98]Oh, my like body temperature rose by like at least 10 to 20%.
[61:01.16]You know, humans have like a 98.6 degrees, 98.7 degrees.
[61:06.22]I'm at at least like 109.
[61:18.22]Doesn't fit.
[61:20.56]Whatever.
[61:22.72]My body's running at like 115 degrees Fahrenheit right now.
[61:28.53]And for all you Celsius guys out there, like 61 Celsius.
[61:41.66]Well, I've stalled as much as I can.
[61:43.06]It's time to go into the fucking stupid night vision room.
[61:51.14]Here we go.
[62:00.92]Wait, this is not it?
[62:03.58]No, this is not it.
[62:05.46]Where's the night vision room?
[62:08.38]No, this is where Charlie was.
[62:09.50]It's one of the other doors.
[62:15.80]Fucking Charlie.
[62:23.70]Which one is it?
[62:25.16]One.
[62:26.42]Two.
[62:26.82]This one right here?
[62:32.02]Yep.
[62:34.70]That looks pretty dark to me.
[62:35.98]Okay.
[62:40.64]Well.
[62:40.80]Let me make sure you guys get to see this shit.
[62:49.27]Fry an egg on Jeremy's face.
[62:56.77]Sometimes I just like to see, I like to pop out and see what you guys are saying about me and about... Actually, this is not even that bad.
[63:03.91]I prefer this than the last area we were just in.
[63:13.40]Shotgun ammo, I will gladly take that, and I will take another coin.
[63:17.46]Where was that vendor, the coin vendor?
[63:19.26]No, I should do that first.
[63:22.82]Where was that coin person, the coin vendor thing?
[63:28.15]I forget where the hell that was.
[63:30.72]Up here.
[63:31.04]Alright, this one is... This is the increase max health or reloading speed increased.
[63:41.16]Who fucking cares?
[63:42.50]Let's put some coins in this one.
[63:54.02]I can do them both now, can't I?
[64:01.55]Let's do it.
[64:02.65]Steroids.
[64:03.75]Dramatically, it strengthens muscles and increases max health.
[64:06.57]Effect lasts indefinitely.
[64:08.21]Go ahead and use it, please.
[64:12.87]So I have... I need two more coins and I can get that.
[64:16.48]Let me store these now.
[64:18.72]Two more coins.
[64:30.19]Two more coins.
[64:33.53]Incendiary grenades.
[64:37.57]This is all fine.
[64:38.81]I want the stun grenade, though.
[64:43.51]Good, good.
[64:45.27]We good?
[64:46.27]We good.
[64:54.05]Still have not found the other soldier.
[64:55.53]This is the breed.
[65:00.67]Already did all this shit in here.
[65:03.68]Let's go get scared, what do you say?
[65:05.32]Okay, don't step on the Dance Dance Revolution pads until you find out what the hell these things do.
[65:25.32]I just said not to do it.
[65:26.90]And the first thing I do is I step immediately onto the fucking fry pan.
[65:31.83]Like, are you stupid?
[65:35.11]I knew I shouldn't have done that.
[65:37.59]It was so unnecessary.
[65:43.37]Well, we can open this.
[65:46.79]What the hell is in here?
[65:51.53]Okay, we have more anti-regen ammo.
[65:54.43]That's literally the only thing that's in here.
[65:55.79]Nice.
[65:56.01]Let's reload this.
[65:58.11]I will need that at some point.
[66:04.86]Good thing I had the lockpick.
[66:14.50]All right, that's obviously a bomb.
[66:17.72]Crawl underneath.
[66:25.10]More bombs, more laser detonators.
[66:31.23]What is that?
[66:34.96]What's that fucking, like, Alexa-looking thing over there?
[66:41.51]Oh, no, it's just a bomb.
[66:42.69]Okay.
[66:43.85]Any more booby traps?
[66:46.51]Is this the booby trap zone?
[66:47.81]You got it.
[66:48.21]Everything is fine?
[66:52.25]And let's go!
[66:53.11]There's the save point.
[67:02.11]No, I want to keep that turd on.
[67:06.43]I like when it's turned on.
[67:07.54]I like when that's turned on.
[67:08.60]I don't like when it's turned off.
[67:11.58]It makes me actually be able to see what the hell is going on.
[67:24.69]It's locked on the other side.
[67:29.89]Let's give her a push.
[67:41.18]What the fuck were you supposed to do about that?
[67:42.78]There's no reaction for that.
[67:45.42]What, do you just wanna waste ammo?
[67:47.01]Die?
[67:47.39]Got anything else back there?
[67:51.09]I need a heal too, this is annoying.
[68:04.42]Is this just turkeys?
[68:06.22]Wow, I thought that was a monster.
[68:15.15]Let's not trigger any events yet.
[68:16.65]Let me look around and make sure there's nothing else I can grab and take with me.
[68:26.03]Nope.
[68:27.07]They all have to be, like, thrown around.
[68:28.45]All right, well, this one has to move.
[68:32.52]All right, so get out of the way.
[68:33.62]Here comes a turkey.
[68:36.78]If I shoot the turkey right in the stomach, what happens?
[68:41.96]Three gumps.
[68:49.09]Okay.
[68:51.43]That's that.
[68:52.27]This destroys... No, it doesn't.
[68:55.93]This one destroys that wall.
[68:57.05]Watch out for the turkey.
[68:57.81]No way, I gotta push this one, too.
[69:06.91]I gotta move this one out of the way.
[69:08.47]Can I?
[69:08.77]Yeah, I can.
[69:09.97]Okay, watch out for the turkey.
[69:10.91]I don't know.
[69:14.69]He's not gonna come from this way.
[69:21.96]That makes enough room for that.
[69:23.34]Let me just make sure there's nothing over here.
[69:24.84]That's worth taking.
[69:29.52]There is not.
[69:33.84]Not that I can see.
[69:40.32]What is this?
[69:41.94]What's pushing this one for?
[69:47.65]Maybe I'll find out.
[69:50.92]Happy fucking birthday, whoever's birthday it is.
[70:05.75]So that one has no point.
[70:09.02]There's no reason to move that one.
[70:12.10]Not that I can see.
[70:24.92]Anybody?
[70:27.44]This looks really, really unassuming, which means there's probably something terrible that's going to happen right now.
[70:33.06]I think I'm going to switch to the super ammo.
[70:35.02]Because you never know.
[70:37.52]So let's have shotgun out.
[70:49.91]Oh, there's the clown.
[70:53.63]Clown door.
[70:54.33]Don't have a key for that.
[70:59.87]This is his fucked up secret little laboratory where he makes all the weird jigsaw puzzles for people.
[71:15.78]Med injector.
[71:16.42]Something's going to happen in this room.
[71:17.54]I'm getting health.
[71:21.23]Anytime a game gives you health anywhere, it means that something bad is going to happen in the room you're in.
[71:27.15]It's just game design, guys.
[71:29.36]It's game design.
[71:30.68]This doesn't open.
[71:41.34]Okay, clown, what do you got?
[71:56.26]You're dead in a weird place.
[71:58.18]Anything else need to be done?
[71:58.96]Alright, I got a handful of clown doors I can open.
[72:01.92]Oh, you little dicks.
[72:19.61]That's a big guy.
[72:20.43]I told you, I knew I was gonna need it.
[72:26.70]Is it more than one?
[72:29.74]No, there's not.
[72:31.02]I knew I was gonna need that shit loaded and locked and loaded.
[72:33.52]Let's go open the first clown door.
[72:39.52]Oh fuck, where is he?
[72:43.02]Oh, come on, you fucking idiot.
[72:45.54]Okay.
[72:54.52]Clown key.
[73:03.36]I think I should heal.
[73:05.12]What do you think?
[73:07.64]Maybe not yet.
[73:08.08]I still haven't, right?
[73:13.69]Load up.
[73:15.51]I still have a bullet in this gun.
[73:16.79]Yes, I do.
[73:19.41]Wait for the inevitable thing to happen.
[73:22.31]Tense.
[73:23.79]Tense.
[73:25.71]All right.
[73:35.93]I think I'm just gonna trigger these.
[73:36.85]I ain't walking down these stairs without triggering this at all.
[73:47.41]I don't even care.
[73:51.05]You guys can call me a fucking idiot if you want.
[73:53.91]I don't have to deal with that now.
[74:05.84]Hey, you okay?
[74:07.70]Huh?
[74:08.36]Hang on.
[74:09.74]I'm coming.
[74:16.60]So, apparently we have to do this.
[74:25.12]Well, be really careful.
[74:26.62]I gotta be slow here.
[74:37.99]So far, so good.
[74:58.86]This sucks.
[75:09.47]Is he dead?
[75:17.52]Don't touch anything.
[75:18.68]Okay.
[75:20.46]I made it successfully over to the guy.
[75:24.06]That's... Inevitably, he's going to die.
[75:27.80]Something awful is going to happen.
[75:30.22]You can die, Chris.
[75:40.08]Did I save him?
[75:52.92]I saved his life.
[75:58.45]What?
[76:05.65]That wasn't part of the cutscene?
[76:06.77]I actually lost?
[76:07.95]How did I lose?
[76:09.96]What was I supposed to... I don't think he is anymore.
[76:26.71]Hey, you okay there?
[76:33.37]Well, you're about to not be.
[76:38.16]So what did I do wrong?
[76:39.18]I don't understand.
[76:39.94]What the fuck did I do wrong?
[76:46.06]What did I do?
[76:48.51]I think I have to shoot them.
[76:52.05]I almost just fucking blew that so bad.
[76:58.39]No, you gotta go this way.
[76:59.80]Oh my lord, this is the worst.
[77:08.77]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[77:09.95]You got to pick him up.
[77:10.55]You got to start shooting.
[77:11.51]Don't need to do this slow.
[77:15.66]Just get it.
[77:18.32]Don't touch him yet.
[77:19.46]Hold on.
[77:19.86]Don't touch him yet.
[77:25.44]Are these going to blow the room?
[77:30.03]I think I have to move him around.
[77:31.45]I don't know what I have to do.
[77:32.25]Marquez?
[77:37.08]Okay, here we go, ready?
[77:37.72]I'm gonna start shooting them, right?
[77:38.64]Here we go.
[77:40.54]Ready?
[77:40.78]Here we go.
[77:41.52]Alright, let's go.
[77:47.45]What do I do?
[77:56.64]I have to shoot specific ones?
[78:07.58]I guess I have to shoot specific ones.
[78:10.82]There's no disabling them.
[78:14.94]What am I gonna turn off the lasers?
[78:37.98]Professional streamer.
[78:39.18]I'll give you a fucking professional stream.
[78:43.46]I can't deactivate them.
[79:03.55]There's a door over there.
[79:05.61]There's nothing over there.
[79:06.35]There's a door.
[79:06.95]How do I... I can't get to that door.
[79:08.51]There's no way to get to that door.
[79:09.41]I have to like... I can't... There's no jump.
[79:11.49]This is Legend of Zelda, guys.
[79:12.62]I can't jump.
[79:41.28]I guess I gotta investigate over here.
[79:43.07]Over by this stupid door.
[79:50.19]Can I stand right here?
[79:51.03]I can.
[79:57.10]Maybe it won't explode if I shoot them.
[80:07.41]Can I deactivate those things?
[80:15.50]There's a way to go over here.
[80:16.48]Okay.
[80:24.49]There it is.
[80:26.43]Pull it.
[80:33.88]Is it a timer?
[80:35.78]We got a timer right now.
[80:37.44]We may be.
[80:44.93]Not doing that yet.
[80:46.63]Don't leave your comrade.
[80:47.57]I'm just trying to fucking open the door, man.
[80:51.46]All right, we did it.
[80:53.08]We're good to go.
[80:55.08]We deactivated the bomb.
[80:56.86]He's gonna die anyways, but... Stand up, don't fall.
[81:14.24]Oh, it's Hunk!
[81:15.24]It's Hunk!
[81:24.47]Definitely Hunk.
[81:28.73]This music is too perfect for him.
[81:30.25]This is getting like his face exploded.
[81:33.24]He's gonna explode.
[81:34.36]Hunk is gonna die here in about five seconds.
[81:37.24]He's gonna get pushed off the ladder.
[81:38.42]We can get out up through there.
[81:43.54]That was stupid.
[81:52.12]That was terrible.
[81:52.84]That was stupid!
[81:56.77]That was stupid.
[81:57.49]I'm real tired of playing games.
[82:00.41]Three men, Lucas.
[82:02.18]Three of my men dead because of you.
[82:04.68]This ends, and it ends now.
[82:08.52]Well, I don't think so.
[82:10.40]It's about to be four dead soldiers in a minute.
[82:13.10]Turn the camera around.
[82:14.58]Oh.
[82:14.98]Then you are going to die.
[82:21.91]Why would they go through all that trouble just to like... Okay, we got a situation here.
[82:27.83]I got fucking 10 minutes to beat the game.
[82:32.28]10 minutes to beat the game.
[82:33.74]Oh boy, that's not good.
[82:35.78]I'm gonna heal right now.
[82:37.08]Heal.
[82:39.54]Oh god damn it.
[82:40.66]Why is it this long?
[82:44.02]Why are you giving me a fucking 10 minute timer?
[82:48.04]There's a clown door downstairs.
[82:50.30]Clown door?
[82:50.76]I don't know.
[82:51.12]I don't even know what door I'm supposed to be going into.
[82:57.39]Oh, shit!
[82:58.79]Punch him!
[83:05.88]I didn't disable any of these.
[83:07.50]I don't got time.
[83:12.74]Oh, God.
[83:14.66]Right in the fucking... Oh, fucking turkey!
[83:16.52]All right, go!
[83:22.92]Ten minutes.
[83:30.08]Clown door.
[83:32.66]Red shutter door.
[83:34.28]You got it.
[83:34.98]Ow.
[84:02.37]Let's go!
[84:17.74]Oh, what's that?
[84:18.96]Bingo!
[84:30.04]Now serious, come on.
[84:32.69]Seven minutes!
[84:40.96]Oh, wait a minute.
[84:55.17]Good.
[84:55.95]Do I have any more of those?
[84:56.87]No, I don't.
[85:01.82]I never killed the big guy.
[85:04.70]Oh, god damn it.
[85:05.84]I can't kill these guys.
[85:08.23]Oh, fuck.
[85:08.55]He's right behind me.
[85:09.11]Where are the canisters?
[85:13.25]He's right fucking behind me and I can't hurt him.
[85:14.75]There we go.
[85:24.55]Right there.
[85:24.87]Bingo.
[85:27.85]Flounder key.
[85:30.79]Open, open, open, open!
[85:32.31]Guy behind me, please open!
[85:34.21]Oh shit!
[85:34.41]What are you happening?
[86:11.93]Six minutes.
[86:13.72]Seven minutes.
[86:16.14]Seven minutes is all I can spare for you.
[86:26.74]Eat, shit, and die.
[86:27.76]Okay, good to know.
[86:29.25]Thank you for the tip.
[86:30.41]I got fucking six minutes.
[86:31.61]All right, hold on.
[86:45.85]Heal it.
[86:46.31]Heal it.
[86:56.47]Where is he?
[86:57.44]I heard a noise.
[86:58.48]I heard a noise.
[86:59.80]And I...
[87:16.36]That's some Mortal Kombat shit.
[87:18.02]Right in the face.
[87:28.73]Get down here!
[87:30.25]Get your f- You dead?
[87:33.73]Are you dead?
[87:34.65]Are you dead?!
[87:42.33]Why are you still alive?! !
[87:49.53]Oh my fucking god!
[87:51.00]I'm dead.
[88:00.96]Oh my fucking god, he's right behind me, right behind me I say, right behind me I do say.
[88:25.57]I don't know what that is.
[88:26.49]What'd I get?
[88:30.13]I'm gonna die.
[88:30.57]I don't have any fucking bullets!
[88:37.95]Oh my god, how do I fu- I can't kill this guy!
[88:39.98]He's not killable right now.
[88:52.82]Hey!
[88:53.00]Hey!
[88:53.22]Hey!
[88:53.60]Hey!
[89:00.96]Damn it.
[89:14.69]I'll get him.
[89:15.09]I'll get this fucking guy.
[89:16.07]Oh my god, I'm going cross-eyed.
[89:20.65]I'm cross-eyed in here.
[89:25.86]I'm actually cross-eyed in here.
[89:27.80]Did I become cross-eyed from VR?
[89:35.08]I think VR made me cross-eyed.
[89:39.07]Am I that one case study where the guy gets fucking cross-eyed from VR?
[89:47.29]Alright, we got incendiary.
[89:52.48]I got one heal.
[90:06.95]Load it up.
[90:10.51]Okay, here we go.
[90:13.87]Shit, what am I thinking?
[90:15.97]What are you thinking?
[90:55.72]Hey!
[90:57.64]Hey, he's running!
[90:58.28]He's running at me.
[91:07.03]Ah, you fucking little shit!
[91:09.89]Where am I?
[91:19.46]Oh my god, I hate these little fucking aliens!
[91:33.49]Which way is he going?
[91:37.14]Do it!
[91:37.48]Are you dead?
[91:53.23]Right in the head.
[92:14.00]Goodbye.
[92:25.03]Oh!
[92:25.99]Turn it down, Chris.
[92:27.19]Now find that nitrogen.
[92:29.59]I have three minutes.
[92:30.19]Where's the nitrogen?
[92:32.85]Where's the nitrogen?
[92:33.49]I got three minutes.
[92:43.50]Go.
[92:45.18]Found it, there's the nitrogen.
[92:46.22]I'm gonna dunk my face in it.
[92:49.96]Here goes nothing.
[92:57.87]I did it.
[92:58.91]Take it off before it thaws and restarts.
[93:10.63]Shit!
[93:11.27]There's still two minutes and 40 seconds on that.
[93:13.30]That's bullshit.
[93:15.71]Okay, Lucas.
[93:17.17]It's just you and me.
[93:21.05]And me.
[93:21.77]I turn around and look at the gun.
[93:23.27]Chris, we're showing a room located behind the shield machine.
[93:25.93]Lucas?
[93:27.59]It's possible.
[93:28.68]See if you can get in there to check it out.
[93:30.66]Got it.
[93:33.58]Okay, you got it.
[93:36.82]Here comes the final confrontation.
[93:45.10]Clown.
[93:53.09]So Lucas is technically the final boss of the game, huh?
[94:00.93]I think he's the final boss of the game.
[94:06.42]I have no healing.
[94:07.74]I have the clown key.
[94:08.88]That's it.
[94:09.40]A couple grenades.
[94:10.40]And...
[94:12.43]26 shots in the clip.
[94:16.01]In the chamber.
[94:17.07]In my pocket.
[94:30.70]Clown.
[94:31.78]Enter the clown key.
[94:34.56]And complete.
[94:36.90]See the final cutscene.
[94:40.66]Save it first.
[94:42.06]Wait, do I have any more, um... No, I didn't get any more.
[94:46.69]I didn't get any more coins, so I'm not even doing it.
[94:49.45]Let's just save it.
[94:52.09]Save data.
[94:55.57]Very nice.
[94:57.97]Fucking terrifying.
[95:00.11]Alright.
[95:01.51]Here we go.
[95:07.47]Welcome to Vault 11.
[95:24.32]That's a big wheel of death.
[95:31.16]Is this thing gonna fall on my head?
[95:39.61]There's an entrance.
[95:42.95]Do I have to get in the ride?
[95:44.03]I think I have to get in the ride.
[95:48.31]Yeah, I do.
[95:58.24]All right, let's go ride the fucking amusement park ride.
[96:02.12]Shotgun shells, a bunch of fucking grenades, a bunch of healing.
[96:06.46]So this is the final encounter up here.
[96:10.72]Let me just take a look and see what I got here.
[96:12.26]Got two heals, plenty of ammo.
[96:20.06]So let's go fight the final boss of Resident Evil 7.
[96:31.45]Can I get my... Very impressive, my friend.
[96:36.30]Very impressive.
[96:38.68]Let's just see how impressive...
[97:12.67]Turns out people are pretty impressive when they have plenty of... Oh, that's one of those aliens!
[97:22.04]I don't have any bullets to kill it.
[97:24.14]I can't kill him.
[97:29.04]I don't have any fucking freeze bullets to kill that guy.
[97:33.88]I don't have any freeze bullets.
[97:36.14]I used them all.
[97:36.67]I'm gonna throw an incendiary grenade down and shoot him in the face.
[97:46.57]So, let's get it equipped.
[97:49.74]I don't have any incendiary grenades.
[97:58.48]Okay.
[98:02.09]Is this an uncompletable encounter?
[98:08.02]Can I not beat this now?
[98:18.77]Test throw?
[98:19.33]No, it's called the trigger button.
[98:31.00]Play the other DLC.
[98:36.61]All right.
[98:39.55]Let's do it.
[98:50.68]There's an incendiary grenade.
[98:53.29]That's what I wanted.
[98:54.09]I need to use this on that guy and burn off his nitrogen and then shoot him in the face four or five times.
[99:03.69]Fuck the knife, by the way.
[99:04.81]Why do I even have this on?
[99:05.76]Let's try it again.
[99:15.19]Very impressive, my friend.
[99:17.05]Very impressive.
[99:19.43]Let's just see how impressive you really are.
[99:23.56]Okay.
[99:24.08]It's a double headshot.
[99:45.81]Here we go.
[99:52.78]What the fuck?
[99:54.72]Oh.
[100:34.41]Wait!
[100:34.67]God dammit!
[101:02.53]Eat shit!
[101:14.36]Change the ammo!
[101:19.07]Change the ammo!

[102:22.98]People, people, people!
[102:25.13]This is not fair!
[102:26.19]I don't have a fucking knife!
[102:39.51]Oh my fucking god, you dumb motherfucker.
[103:00.58]I got no fucking... I have nothing left.
[103:02.32]Get up there!
[103:26.09]Come on!
[103:28.69]What do we got?
[103:31.69]What do we got?
[103:32.07]What do we got?
[103:32.55]Gun?
[103:32.81]Bullets?
[103:42.34]Nobody, you're not allowed to come up the stairs.
[103:43.74]Don't waste the ammo.
[104:09.55]Don't have any more bullets
[104:42.38]Don't give me another timer on the screen.
[104:44.08]What do you mean seven?
[105:18.82]Can I get out?
[105:24.86]Oh, wait.
[105:27.01]No, don't do, don't say four.
[105:28.49]I don't know where to go.
[106:06.67]Doesn't open oh come on it doesn't open This Chris red I Don't have to do the whole thing again, right?
[106:36.36]I don't have to do that whole thing again.
[106:38.30]Right?
[106:38.52]Okay.
[106:42.76]Get off the screen so I can see where the fuck I'm going!
[107:04.61]Every second, soldier boy.
[107:07.62]Just like I'm going to enjoy watching... I can't fucking see anything.
[107:11.16]You hear that?
[107:14.18]Sounds like time's running out for you.
[107:16.68]Tick-tock, Christopher.
[107:18.06]Tick-tock.
[107:19.76]You're gonna kill me, just kill me.
[107:23.33]For the love of God, shut the fuck up.
[107:26.63]Oh, I wish I could stand while you burn it.
[107:35.57]Oh, this is so fucking annoying.
[107:38.25]Get off the screen.
[107:39.53]Like, get out of here.
[107:44.89]God damn it!
[107:58.89]Does this get burnt?
[108:08.85]Get it!
[108:10.09]Open it, dude!
[108:20.84]It's gonna blow.
[108:22.67]It's gonna blow.
[108:23.27]I'm seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.
[108:25.93]Oh my god, dude.
[108:27.21]Come on.
[108:27.93]I have to do this whole thing again because I didn't pick the right grate.
[108:36.76]Come on.
[108:43.03]It's a long ten count.
[108:45.57]She stopped at two.
[109:01.85]Okay.
[109:05.62]I think, uh... I think I did it.
[109:08.74]No, they haven't.
[109:23.92]Your dad.
[109:24.76]So that's not it.
[109:27.10]I thought that was gonna be the end.
[109:28.98]That is not the end of the game.
[109:30.68]I was certain that was gonna be it.
[109:59.11]Well... Looks like we're still going.
[110:05.75]I'm surprised this was free.
[110:15.20]This feels like a very not-free DLC, but it's just for free.
[110:23.28]Cool, I guess.
[110:31.26]One of those things.
[110:32.14]I think there's like two of those things, actually.
[110:34.82]Three of them.
[110:42.51]This reminds me of Resident Evil 4.
[110:46.45]You guys remember the regenerators from Resident Evil 4?
[110:48.24]The first room you see the first regenerator in?
[110:50.26]It's kind of like this.
[110:51.00]It's a treasure photo.
[110:53.78]I kind of don't give a shit.
[111:01.83]Alright, let's... Let's get in there, huh?
[111:24.97]Ah, you fucking blew it!
[111:40.03]Dead, right?
[111:47.55]Well, at least there's more of that.
[111:56.72]Whatever the fuck that is.
[111:58.32]Log, health, good.
[111:59.18]Mental state, good, good, good.
[112:00.58]He's all good.
[112:01.22]Everything's good.
[112:01.86]We're all good.
[112:02.94]Nothing wrong.
[112:05.07]Med injector.
[112:07.57]Is there no reason to come in here?
[112:12.83]Any secret codes?
[112:15.31]No secret codes.
[112:16.21]That's the wheelchair for that lady.
[112:18.09]The bad lady.
[112:20.90]I think this is Emily's spot.
[112:27.28]Couple of cages.
[112:28.18]Nothing of value in here.
[112:30.47]Let's go.
[112:36.07]Pretty lore heavy in here, it seems.
[112:44.02]Nothing else in there.
[112:44.80]We're going to go back down.
[112:45.70]We're good.
[112:56.94]Stairs.
[112:57.54]Let's go.
[113:04.15]That guy's going to get up.
[113:09.29]Very easy.
[113:10.35]I knew it.
[113:10.67]I fucking knew it was going to happen.
[113:12.03]I fucking knew it.
[113:15.85]And what?
[113:16.21]God fucking dammit.
[113:32.14]Couple of grenades.
[113:33.24]Always useful.
[113:34.32]Always handy.
[113:40.82]Sick of this guy Lucas.
[113:41.82]Lucas is like a guy that worked here.
[113:43.90]He's a real dick.
[113:50.79]night vision not much further it seems let's see in this room
[114:24.99]Why is he not in a chair?
[114:39.96]Should I knock on the window?
[114:40.84]Okay, well, let's go over here first.
[114:59.51]Nothing here, except for this.
[115:12.24]He's gonna just be sitting there the whole time, guaranteed.
[115:14.04]Oh, there's no power.
[115:17.74]Yeah, well, maybe I have to turn the power on.
[115:20.50]He's too busy watching porn for me to know that I'm even in here.
[115:34.61]It's me.
[115:39.69]I'm coming to get you.
[115:49.14]You dick.
[115:49.58]All right, save point.
[115:55.07]Got a lock pick.
[116:00.10]Don't mind the criminal that's running away.
[116:02.10]Just go in here and go in your inventory for a little while.
[116:09.05]That's fine.
[116:16.73]Lucas, get back here!
[116:17.93]I'm gonna play the tape recorder for a few minutes.
[116:22.30]I remember that song.
[116:24.88]That one takes me back to when I was a boy.
[116:29.07]What else you got in here?
[116:30.05]A couple of lockers.
[116:32.17]That's real nice.
[116:33.09]I feel like I really need to go this way.
[116:46.16]So, is he like a researcher?
[116:47.36]I don't understand.
[117:03.62]Kinda can't go that way, I gotta... I don't fucking know.
[117:20.20]Now crouching doesn't help either.
[117:23.88]I can't shoot it.
[117:25.92]I think I just gotta go all the way around.
[117:32.66]No, there's only one way to go.
[117:33.72]This is the only way.
[117:36.18]Oh, it's out of bullets.
[117:46.71]Okay, well, sure thing.
[117:50.31]Scared for nothing.
[117:53.55]Me being a psycho actually paid off.
[118:03.72]Where you at?
[118:07.30]How the hell are you still alive?
[118:09.20]You should be dead.
[118:10.42]We got your e-mails.
[118:12.02]We know you're funneling information.
[118:13.36]We got your e-mails.
[118:14.28]Sonny, you're goddamn right, Chris.
[118:15.42]Why?
[118:15.83]A lot of people out there want to know about our little AV.
[118:20.65]I wanted to.
[118:21.71]Your friends at the connections know about this?
[118:23.39]They don't strike me as the forgettable type.
[118:25.45]That's my business.
[118:28.05]You let me worry about that.
[118:30.18]You're about to have your hands full.
[118:32.06]Oh, not another one of those.
[118:40.95]Somebody turns into a monster.
[119:06.08]Here's the giant monster fight!
[119:34.84]We actually never got to see him turn into a giant monster, so I'm interested to see what it is.
[119:38.70]Interested.
[119:46.89]What did he turn into?
[119:47.77]A giant blob?
[119:51.85]Well, there he is.
[120:00.06]So he's a fucking Decepticon, okay.
[120:04.40]I'll accept it.
[120:07.14]Shit.
[120:07.74]Oh shit.
[120:10.59]Oh my god, I'm already dead.
[120:11.81]I'm already dead.
[120:12.71]I already died.
[120:13.31]I already died.
[120:48.86]54 fucking bullets.
[120:51.63]That's a lot.
[121:05.08]It's got no fucking time.
[121:07.60]What is that?
[121:26.20]All right, let's do it again.
[121:38.94]No!
[121:39.79]What the fuck is he doing?
[121:58.33]Shit.
[121:59.27]Oh, I need to take oxygen too?
[122:15.14]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[122:20.09]Yeah!
[122:21.75]Yeah!
[122:22.25]Where's the oxygen?
[122:28.37]Is there only one oxygen station in this whole fucking goddamn building?
[122:32.74]It's right there.
[122:35.30]It's back up top.
[122:38.56]Eat it.
[122:49.67]Come back down.
[122:54.02]Shit.
[123:07.50]Die!
[123:08.80]Die!
[123:24.24]And there he is!
[123:26.68]Goodbye!
[123:27.52]Game over.
[123:35.83]No one-liner?
[123:36.79]We don't even get a one-liner from Lucas for his big end?
[123:41.93]That's kind of intense.
[123:45.44]I was just gonna say, torch the fucking thing.
[123:54.42]Just attack it.
[123:55.83]Destroy it.
[124:06.10]From your river.
[124:07.72]What's the sitrep?
[124:08.40]The facility is clear.
[124:09.96]Even the newer breeds have been neutralized.
[124:12.90]You did it, Chris.
[124:14.78]And you haven't aged once in 31 years.
[124:17.92]I'm outta here.
[124:20.70]You should be in, like, your late 60s by now.
[124:27.62]Resident Evil 1 took place in 1972.
[124:31.14]Good.
[124:34.36]Think we did any good here?
[124:40.01]What are they gonna do for Resident Evil 8?
[124:48.36]It's gonna be Wesker.
[124:52.92]Where's my mic?
[124:54.52]Here it is.
[124:56.57]You thought I was dead.
[124:58.53]But I'm not, motherfucker.
[125:02.47]I'll see you at Resident Evil 8, you little bitches.
[125:07.73]Ah, that's fucking funny.
[125:09.77]That's fucking funny.
[125:11.73]That's fucking funny.
[125:12.71]That's funny.
[125:17.88]How long did that take?
[125:26.34]What a bad... What a bad DLC.
[125:28.20]What are you talking about?
[125:29.72]That wasn't that bad.
[125:32.53]Don't give me ha-has.
[125:33.59]That was an intentionally bad joke.
[125:37.67]I wasn't trying to make you laugh.
[125:38.75]I was trying to make you go, God, fuck this guy.
[125:43.27]All right, well, I did, that was it.
[125:47.00]Antique coin, six out of 10.
[125:48.50]Files obtained, four to nine.
[125:49.82]Item box opened, five.
[125:51.02]Attacks deflected, one.
[125:54.52]I disagree.
[125:58.86]Difficulty professional.
[125:59.84]Item Thor's hammer.
[126:03.96]That was cool, but what was wrong with that?
[126:07.81]Is it bad that I liked it?
[126:10.21]The DLC.
[126:10.85]This is a free game.
[126:13.23]This shit was completely free.
[126:16.52]This Chris Redfield DLC does not cost a cent.
[126:26.12]Can't complain, man.
[126:26.84]That's free shit.
[126:27.42]Alright.
[126:32.93]So now... Give me one second here.
[126:37.57]Let me turn this down.
[126:39.18]Give me one second.
[126:43.34]No, that's not.
