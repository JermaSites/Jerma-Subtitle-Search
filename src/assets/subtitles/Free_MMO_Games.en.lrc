[00:02.52]Hey, how's everybody up to?
[00:06.62]Me too.
[00:07.64]Not much.
[00:12.34]Yeah, we're playing Wizard 101.
[00:16.85]I mean, 77% of people in this chat last night demanded this game.
[00:22.79]So, yeah, that's what we're going to do.
[00:25.83]We're going to play it.
[00:28.99]We've got a few.
[00:30.09]We've got like three free children MMOs to play.
[00:36.47]Start with Wizard 101.
[00:39.15]And then from here, we're going to go to Pirates.
[00:42.67]And then from here, after that, we're going to go to Disney Presents the Remake of Club Penguin.
[00:50.64]This might be a short one tonight.
[00:53.80]This might be like an hour and 25 minutes.
[00:57.80]I could not get Toontown to work.
[01:01.00]Toontown Rewritten is the one that's the fan remake.
[01:05.30]I can't get past the launcher no matter what I do.
[01:08.18]I tried everything.
[01:08.80]I probably spent like an hour while here today trying to get Toontown to work.
[01:15.59]Yeah, Rewritten.
[01:17.71]The launcher crashes every time.
[01:24.89]You're actually doing it.
[01:26.05]Wait, are you saying no?
[01:28.04]You're actually doing it?
[01:35.31]I thought it was a joke.
[01:36.79]Hold on a minute.
[01:37.89]You thought it was a joke.
[01:40.23]We voted for the- Did nobody expect this to happen?
[01:49.33]I spent like the last hour and a half like get dry.
[01:51.75]Okay, let's spend like two hours preparing shitty free children's MMOs.
[01:55.80]And this is, you guys are just fucking around?
[01:57.14]You didn't want this?
[02:00.56]Well, you did it.
[02:01.82]This is, you did it.
[02:06.99]People thought this was a joke.
[02:08.20]Well, welcome to a stream that's probably going to be two hours long.
[02:11.64]I'm just telling you right now, prepare yourself for a little quick one.
[02:16.54]I don't know.
[02:16.80]What if I get addicted to Wizard101?
[02:18.40]It's my favorite game ever made.
[02:25.99]Well, okay.
[02:26.83]Here we go.
[02:28.31]Thanks for joining us.
[02:30.59]Oh, wait.
[02:31.77]Important thing to add to the emote contest.
[02:35.24]Something that needs to be said.
[02:37.62]very important if you are participating in the emote contest you can only submit three only up to three total submissions per character per user so pick the three that you want to show the most not like 40.
[03:08.85]Oh, and by the way, if you try to use an alternate account, I know who you are.
[03:13.08]You don't think I got data?
[03:15.64]You don't think I can see the data?
[03:18.88]Oh, my name is BDbutthole101.
[03:22.62]Oh, are you really?
[03:23.72]Because I got the data on you that says that you're also Chairmaster4, so sorry.
[03:31.50]I know these things.
[03:36.68]All right, so let's go.
[03:42.93]Turn on the music here.
[03:44.41]Welcome to Wizard 101!
[03:47.63]You know, I used to see commercials of this game on TV.
[03:51.43]And I didn't know what it was.
[03:52.61]I thought it was actually a school.
[03:54.91]I was like, wow, you can go to wizard school?
[03:56.21]For real?
[03:56.73]That's cool.
[03:57.11]Is that like an artist?
[03:58.29]No, I'm lying.
[04:01.30]Eric Frogwalker is my name.
[04:05.26]I'm a storm magician.
[04:07.68]I read the description.
[04:09.62]Sounded kind of like me, I think.
[04:14.01]You've never seen this game.
[04:14.99]Alright, well, I'm going to hit play.
[04:17.59]I hope we don't break the game.
[04:20.70]Eric Frogwalker.
[04:21.64]Do I pick, like, a server?
[04:23.94]Okay, I don't want to skip the tutorial.
[04:31.30]How come he gets to be so much cooler?
[04:32.40]Why are the birds so loud?
[04:34.79]My name is Merle Ambrose.
[04:37.15]I am a headmaster of the Ravenwood School of Magical Arts.
[04:41.03]Okay, Ravenwood.
[04:44.64]We're expecting great things from you, but first things first.
[04:50.34]How to walk.
[04:51.44]To move around, use the arrow keys.
[04:53.82]No, not the arrow keys.
[04:55.26]W-A-S-D.
[04:55.64]Try it now.
[04:56.88]W-A-S-D?
[04:58.02]My owl friend would like to speak with you.
[05:01.27]Walk up to Gamma and follow his instructions to talk.
[05:05.15]Okay, we got, hold on, let me, no, no, don't quit.
[05:09.09]I need to turn the birds down.
[05:10.67]All I hear are birds.
[05:13.50]Alright, hello Gamma.
[05:17.96]Tank control.
[05:19.96]This game gave me a Trojan.
[05:21.48]Well, hope that doesn't happen to me.
[05:25.05]Is that misspelling?
[05:33.01]Dueling with an L at the end?
[05:35.15]Duelingle?
[05:37.57]How long has this game been out?
[05:41.46]This game's been up for, like, 15 years and it's still misspelled?
[05:47.81]Okay, learn my spells.
[05:48.93]I don't like the voice for this.
[05:50.77]You got glasses on an owl, he better have, like, a 75-year-old man voice.
[05:54.31]Okay, we're gonna teach man to duel.
[06:13.00]Bad guy that attacks the town, right?
[06:16.04]Fantasia.
[06:17.94]Am I the Mickey Mouse here?
[06:20.51]You got it.
[06:20.93]Is there a jump?
[06:21.65]Yes, there is.
[06:22.13]Of course there is.
[06:22.89]Why would there not be a jump?
[06:25.81]Right click is cast spell.
[06:26.67]That's Jafar, the evil guy.
[06:29.27]Ambrose.
[06:44.01]You are no longer welcome here.
[06:46.31]Why have you returned?
[06:47.25]I'm here to resolve our unfinished business.
[06:53.40]Is this your latest student?
[06:56.72]I love how the animals followed us into the house.
[07:01.22]Hurry along, young wizard.
[07:02.58]Take this deck of spill cards and deal with those creatures while I tend to malastare himself.
[07:08.81]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[07:09.97]Is this a card game you guys made me download?
[07:13.47]Don't be so sure of yourself, old man.
[07:19.29]Run up and confront them.
[07:20.91]Be brave.
[07:22.39]I will guide you.
[07:23.17]Are you sure?
[07:24.63]Is this a card game?
[07:29.58]Oh, goddammit.
[07:30.72]It's a fucking card game.
[07:34.27]Oh, god, come on!
[07:36.69]I don't want to fucking play a card game!
[07:39.29]I thought this was Wizard 101!
[07:42.91]Oh, my... Whatever.
[07:49.13]Firecat or troll?
[07:50.49]We're gonna put a troll out there.
[07:51.91]This is Yu-Gi-Oh, isn't it?
[08:06.51]I thought this was going to be walk around and pick up loot and attack people.
[08:10.25]It's a turn-based card Yu-Gi-Oh!
[08:15.11]strategy game.
[08:24.26]Oh my, you're hurt.
[08:26.56]You'll need to pay attention to your current health.
[08:30.16]It should have been two in town.
[08:31.48]I couldn't get two in town to run.
[08:34.02]This red crystal ball shows your health.
[08:37.79]If you run out of health, you know, the blue crystal ball shows your mana is magic.
[08:43.33]When you're out of mana, you'll be at the mercy.
[08:45.75]Why are you so distracted?
[08:48.15]We're under attack.
[08:49.89]Okay, so you gotta have mana to do things.
[08:52.41]You gotta have health.
[08:53.55]You gotta have blood.
[08:54.39]I have 300 blood.
[08:55.95]Okay, attack him again.
[09:04.13]My little brother played this when he was 10.
[09:07.13]And now I'm playing it at 32.
[09:08.15]So, we got a little bit of a gap there.
[09:17.51]Am I gonna die?
[09:23.30]You can't lose the tutorial, right?
[09:24.70]This game was made for four-year-olds.
[09:27.92]I don't think it's possible to lose this game.
[09:31.41]If I do, then I'm in deep shit.
[09:34.76]There is a heal.
[09:36.14]Do I get a priority here because it's a spell?
[09:39.76]I don't think so.
[09:41.32]Quickly, use...
[10:03.37]Pop Tropica.
[10:04.59]Oh, we gotta go through these.
[10:05.99]Doesn't mean we can't do this again.
[10:08.70]We got Pirates Online, which is the Pirates of the Caribbean MMO.
[10:11.96]Foolish creatures!
[10:12.90]You've let the young whelp heal.
[10:14.86]Defeat the whelp or you'll suffer for it.
[10:17.58]Use your spells to weaken the young wizard's... Here, young wizard.
[10:23.26]Take some more pips.
[10:25.32]They power your spells.
[10:27.34]The more pips you have, the stronger the spells you can cast.
[10:32.09]Okay.
[10:32.37]Nature's Wrath.
[10:35.17]We at least have to, like, get to the town, right?
[10:45.13]Alright, I'm going to give you just a little bit of a review here.
[10:55.84]First impressions of this game.
[10:58.78]It seems fairly well made.
[11:01.60]Animations.
[11:02.18]Vocal acting work.
[11:02.80]Oh no, he's having fun.
[11:04.84]He's starting to like it.
[11:08.75]Uh oh.
[11:26.35]Look at that phoenix.
[11:27.53]That's pretty cool.
[11:28.55]Hearthstone doesn't do that.
[11:34.28]Look at this guy.
[11:36.46]Look at these character designs.
[11:39.82]Can they even do a slow motion arrow into the head?
[11:41.62]Really?
[11:49.26]You know, that was better than the summon that was in Final Fantasy XII.
[11:54.00]Do it.
[12:19.11]I mean, I'm probably gonna... Look at this!
[12:20.85]Ninja pigs too?
[12:25.64]That's cool.
[12:28.44]How much is this card?
[12:29.34]Alright, you got... You're selling me here on these way cooler than Final Fantasy animations.
[12:47.50]Victory.
[12:47.82]I win.
[12:49.00]Oh, excellent work, young wizard.
[12:51.92]Now, let me see to Malistan.
[12:55.02]I'll show him.
[12:56.63]Threatening a new student before orientation, no less.
[13:00.49]Another time, old man.
[13:03.23]I have what I came for.
[13:04.77]And now I'll take my leave of this wretched place.
[13:10.61]use the arrow keys to move around he's gone and none too soon what sinister goal brought him here oh my you look a bit the worse for wear I don't know if I would trust this guy let me restore you to your full health and manner all right change take away the clothing on this guy and the guy that was just in the room I I don't know if I'd pick this guy as a good guy
[13:35.80]Take away his fun, cool pajama clothes here, and he's a bad guy.
[13:39.34]I would think he'd be on the other side.
[13:42.14]The other guy belongs over here.
[13:43.09]Put the other hat on him, too.
[13:44.57]On the bright side, congratulations.
[13:47.89]Defeating Malistaire's henchmen has earned you some experience.
[13:52.03]This experience bar will help you track your progress.
[13:55.84]Oh, dude, how many bubbles are you to 31?
[13:58.36]Almost there, bro.
[13:59.60]When the bar fills up, you'll gain a level and be able to learn new spells.
[14:07.55]Now, do you have any questions, young wizard?
[14:11.35]What's that?
[14:11.87]Yes.
[14:12.39]You don't know how to speak.
[14:15.67]My pardon.
[14:18.80]Well then, let me teach you how to use menu chat.
[14:22.28]And we'll see what you have to say for yourself.
[14:24.58]How do you learn?
[14:25.32]Let me teach you how to open the menu and chat.
[14:27.26]This is the menu chat button.
[14:29.16]It's the most amazing spell.
[14:30.44]Sad.
[14:30.60]Stinky.
[14:35.02]Why?
[14:35.36]That wasn't nice.
[14:35.92]Don't be mean.
[14:36.62]Where's Stinky?
[14:38.97]Boo hoo.
[14:39.59]Oh, yikes.
[14:40.05]Sorry.
[14:44.71]You have the way of it.
[14:46.53]Now you can chat with anyone you meet and make lots of friends here.
[14:49.83]So what, you can't actually type?
[14:51.45]You have emoticon typing?
[14:53.95]You can also hit enter and type your own messages using text chat.
[14:59.59]But players under 13 will first need their parents' permission.
[15:04.23]What did I pick for an age?
[15:05.37]I might have, I don't know.
[15:06.53]You'll also need a spell book and a wand.
[15:09.33]Every time you send a message, you've got to have your mother come and sign a receipt.
[15:11.49]No young wizard should care about them.
[15:18.27]I should say, young wizard, that I was quite impressed with your courage.
[15:22.37]Hey, Mom?
[15:24.84]I want to call this guy a cockface.
[15:27.16]Can you come in here and sign the paper?
[15:33.61]Who knows?
[15:34.83]Maybe you'll fill my shoes and become headmaster someday.
[15:39.53]Hmm, maybe I'll be the headmaster.
[15:40.89]Oh, you're grounding.
[15:41.55]All right, let's go.
[15:42.51]All right, so now the world opens up, and I get to choose my path.
[15:44.99]So many books.
[15:45.43]Where do I put those books?
[15:46.57]Okay.
[15:46.75]All right, let's go.
[15:47.57]Well...
[16:09.48]Loading human dialogue?
[16:10.82]What is this?
[16:11.40]Human loading narrator.
[16:13.74]Ghoul hunter, jump.
[16:16.05]What, is it downloading the whole game in the background?
[16:19.67]This is Wizard City.
[16:21.27]I can't add anybody on Xbox right now.
[16:24.37]Alright, Wizard City.
[16:37.53]I have an idea.
[16:38.67]Perhaps if it wouldn't be too much trouble, you might take a look.
[16:42.75]You may be able to help.
[16:44.41]A virus.
[16:44.83]It will also let you see more of Wizard City.
[16:47.35]Yeah, let me see more of Wizard City.
[16:51.93]The headmaster hands you a letter with an ornate wax seal.
[16:55.71]Why is that little elephant from Adventure Time talking right now?
[16:59.25]Please deliver this letter to Private Stillson at the Unicorn Way gate.
[17:03.55]He will let you through.
[17:04.47]Is she in this game?
[17:05.19]You will use the yellow quest helper arrow at the bottom of your screen to guide you there.
[17:11.00]That was so odd.
[17:12.32]Where did that come from?
[17:13.12]Why was it only one line?
[17:17.07]All right.
[17:17.33]Talk to Private Stiltson.
[17:19.61]And you get five coins and 30 diplomas.
[17:22.79]All right.
[17:23.25]Let's deliver it.
[17:26.82]Are these players?
[17:29.30]Michael Lifeglade.
[17:30.24]We've got some novice.
[17:34.48]There's a dragon.
[17:35.16]Okay.
[17:35.42]Do I have a pet?
[17:38.33]Uh-oh.
[17:39.11]Yeah.
[17:39.67]This is a person in the chat room right now.
[17:42.19]Guaranteed.
[17:42.75]All right.
[17:42.97]We're going to go to Wizard City.
[17:45.29]Over here.
[17:48.04]You have just been given a tutorial tip.
[17:50.26]These will occasionally appear on the right hand side of your screen.
[17:57.90]Who?
[17:59.90]Okay.
[18:00.84]These are portraits that give you timely information when you click on them.
[18:05.31]You're gonna get stream sniped on Wizard 101.
[18:10.09]You can fish.
[18:10.83]You can get a pet.
[18:11.73]You can craft.
[18:13.39]You can enter player versus player tournaments.
[18:15.33]I can play this game for like four hours.
[18:19.07]Alright, let me just get this out of the way first.
[18:23.69]Okay, um... This way... Are these people?
[18:34.44]No, they're not.
[18:38.16]You come into my server to kick my ass.
[18:40.90]Well, you can't hurt me.
[18:41.92]It's like Diablo 2.
[18:43.00]I have to clear hostility on you.
[18:45.96]None shall pass.
[18:47.22]Unicorn Way is off limits.
[18:49.02]You show Private Stilson a letter with Headmaster Ambrose's wax seal.
[18:53.73]Oh, I just can't wait to make myself a pie.
[18:56.69]Come on in here, Finn, and get yourself a pie.
[18:59.53]Looks legit.
[19:00.49]I'll let you pass.
[19:01.85]Show this to Private Conley in Unicorn Way.
[19:06.41]Okay, Unicorn Way.
[19:07.73]That was fun.
[19:16.62]Alright, smelly Ben.
[19:17.66]Is that me?
[19:18.50]No.
[19:20.84]There's like a couple of merchants.
[19:25.19]Delete that sub sound.
[19:27.27]What?
[19:28.21]I can't.
[19:28.79]I just put it on.
[19:34.30]Be careful going farther down Unicorn Way.
[19:37.04]The street is dangerous.
[19:38.54]I've seen wizards like you go down that way and never come back.
[19:42.10]Your arrival is a blessing.
[19:44.18]We need help fending off the ghosts in Unicorn Way.
[19:48.00]Some dark forces have risen and we don't have enough guards to stop them.
[19:53.41]I love this game.
[19:55.27]Someone's having a blast over there in that gazebo.
[19:58.01]We would be honored if you would use your powers and chase lost souls away for us.
[20:03.23]All right, accept.
[20:07.74]Did I just like team up with a level 61?
[20:12.28]I'm gonna tell you right now that person probably last logged into the game mmm, like Probably logged into the game.
[20:20.71]I'm gonna say like nine years ago and He saw that this was being streamed and he was like, holy shit.
[20:26.57]Do I remember my password?
[20:28.03]I do and he's in All right, we're gonna kill though.
[20:31.33]We gotta get rid of these guys All right, so it's touched combat
[20:37.66]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[20:38.44]Why are we... Hold on.
[20:43.79]Uh... Thundersnake.
[20:46.91]Select or discard.
[20:49.69]Two of nine cards.
[20:50.99]Uh, I'm gonna do Miner's Spark.
[20:53.74]Okay, he's got a party too.
[20:55.14]This guy just stream sniped him.
[21:06.54]I'm a electrocution school.
[21:12.92]Okay.
[21:14.24]Uh, Thunder Snake.
[21:22.45]Let's try this.
[21:30.19]Epic.
[21:30.87]Oh, dude.
[21:35.78]Can you swear in this game?
[21:37.00]I don't think you can.
[21:38.91]They literally have, like, the swear filter on.
[21:40.57]I mean, this game is, like, T for team.
[21:42.47]Not even, it's E for everyone.
[21:43.47]Not even, it's G for great.
[21:48.39]So, I'm gonna kill another one of these?
[21:52.10]Uh... Just lightning bolt, you know?
[21:55.46]Easy that way.
[21:56.02]Wait, I can't?
[21:59.72]No, I'm not gonna swear, man.
[22:01.90]So, you want me to say a swear and get banned from the game permanently?
[22:09.39]This boss cheats.
[22:17.98]I got a keeper!
[22:20.80]What is he doing here with his little fairy?
[22:25.86]Say it?
[22:26.80]No, I can't say it.
[22:29.87]Let's try, like... Okay, let's test the filter here.
[22:33.33]What do you say?
[22:36.33]Nope.
[22:39.36]nope you can't that you there is no level 120. you cannot say any remotely bad words you're gonna go back to the guy okay what about like dumb nope even something like dumb uh hold on um
[23:04.67]Idiot.
[23:04.95]What's like even more tame than dumb?
[23:07.49]Fool.
[23:09.01]Okay, you can call somebody a fool.
[23:14.11]Heck.
[23:15.43]Heck is okay.
[23:19.31]Let's talk to him.
[23:20.15]You are, you fool.
[23:22.15]He's still downloading the whole game still.
[23:31.06]You should talk to Saren Nightchant and see if he can use any help.
[23:36.56]That guy that's 120 is going to tear us apart.
[23:38.40]He can't even attack me.
[23:42.54]We're really going to fill this up, aren't we?
[23:46.17]So can we just walk to the edge of the earth?
[23:50.47]Can we go with like 100 people and just walk to the higher level zones?
[23:54.01]Greetings.
[23:56.02]Professor Mulinda Wu sent me here to see if the rumors about the fairies are true.
[24:00.24]The guards won't allow me to go out any further, but they haven't stopped you yet.
[24:05.39]Would you check for me?
[24:06.71]Just walk down Unicorn Way and see if you can find any fairies.
[24:10.39]If they attack, you'd best know how to defend yourself.
[24:13.81]I'm going to join a group?
[24:15.11]I'm sure.
[24:15.52]Oh, this is where it starts.
[24:21.66]Wait, I don't want to have my friends list open.
[24:23.88]Alright, we're going to go down Unicorn Way.
[24:32.62]Got another mission here.
[24:34.46]We can pick this up, probably.
[24:35.40]Oh, good gracious.
[24:36.94]Do you think you could help me, young wizard?
[24:41.24]It's really scary looking.
[24:45.92]Pirate quest.
[24:47.02]We're looking for pirates.
[24:50.24]We're looking for fairies.
[24:57.17]We gave everybody a night to create a character.
[25:01.23]Well, then I'm not surprised.
[25:03.87]What about like, can you do actually any emote?
[25:06.11]Like dancing?
[25:09.13]Yeah, there is.
[25:09.69]Okay.
[25:10.43]What the fuck is this?
[25:12.89]Hold on.
[25:13.85]Where do you guys get these mounts?
[25:18.08]We're just riding on this... Alright.
[25:22.24]Well, this is a lot faster.
[25:26.12]How much does this cost?
[25:27.76]I gotta get off.
[25:28.16]We have to fight these guys.
[25:31.71]Can we just aggro the whole town?
[25:33.23]Is that how it works?
[25:33.75]Alright, there's one fairy here.
[25:40.20]Yeah, let's go ahead and bring- and this guy's like, oh no, I can't participate!
[25:45.00]I need to get in a circle!
[25:46.86]Wait for me!
[25:47.57]Wait!
[25:49.23]Oh, I need the experience points!
[25:53.43]What's going on?
[25:56.55]Wait, I can't move.
[25:57.57]Okay, um, I'm so confused I can't even see.
[26:12.26]How many people can be on one server?
[26:18.68]Oh, it wasn't my turn.
[26:24.34]Stop that.
[26:24.95]Oh, they're looking at me.
[26:27.99]They're looking at me.
[26:29.83]Check this out.
[26:32.19]Alright, so is the guy that's with the carrot in his hand?
[26:37.97]He's going to cast one giant lightning bolt spell and kill everything, right?
[26:49.98]Holy shit, that's the best thing in the world.
[26:52.56]That is awesome.
[26:53.82]This is awesome!
[26:59.42]That just did 2900 damage?
[27:02.92]What?
[27:03.60]Hold on, hold on a second.
[27:04.66]Did that just do 3000 fucking damage to that guy?
[27:07.58]I'm so confused.
[27:08.84]What's happening?
[27:13.12]Is it scaling the enemies because there's a guy in our party that's max level?
[27:23.92]That thing has 28... How much health?
[27:26.26]This thing only has like 50 HP.
[27:35.37]I'm gonna get one shot.
[27:36.57]Wait, I have like a bunch of buffs right now.
[27:39.80]You know, I'm just gonna fucking pass.
[27:41.40]What's the point?
[27:41.96]I'm gonna cast a little lightning bolt.
[27:47.50]It's not gonna do anything.
[27:53.44]I'm just gonna get carried.
[27:57.30]Critical.
[27:58.94]Critical blocked.
[28:06.63]Is the guy just dancing here?
[28:07.83]Alright.
[28:11.07]Fizzle.
[28:12.65]I'm getting carried.
[28:13.25]Yeah, I'm just gonna get carried by viewers.
[28:14.53]That's what we're gonna do.
[28:19.47]What does this have to do?
[28:20.78]Is that your character?
[28:24.01]Why do you have an ant holding the earth?
[28:31.17]Okay, you just used like a god spell.
[28:39.22]Okay, completed.
[28:40.12]I beat the game.
[28:43.46]That's not done though.
[28:44.22]I don't need to... Don't I need to kill these guys?

[29:28.59]It is.
[29:28.91]This is cool.
[29:33.86]I can see being like younger and thinking that I have like some friends to play this with.
[29:39.38]This would be cool.
[29:40.00]This would be cool.
[29:42.32]It would.
[29:44.32]We're seeing every major spell in the whole game.
[29:58.99]Alright, dude, like... Summon an Ichabod Crane.
[30:06.97]No, just pass.
[30:07.69]We're getting a show here.
[30:15.16]All realms are full.
[30:17.72]God.
[30:23.10]Jeremy, use one... Use... Use these iPhone emojis.
[30:28.83]I don't know what these are.
[30:30.11]This is like... Good luck.
[30:33.91]Like, it's lit.
[30:34.97]And then, uh, the hundred thing.
[30:37.07]When it's like, a hundred, yeah, meme, a hundred.
[30:39.15]Yes, a hundred.
[30:41.63]Are you away from your keyboard?
[30:43.89]I don't know.
[30:45.39]I can't do anything cool.
[30:46.89]I can summon electric snakes.
[30:48.34]I can't do anything else.
[31:01.42]I feel like we've seen too much.
[31:06.63]We've seen the coolest shit in the game already on screen.
[31:10.83]Zap snakes are not doing it anymore for anybody.
[31:16.11]This guy's a themed character.
[31:17.25]He has all Halloween themed stuff.
[31:24.24]Lightning on the pirate.
[31:26.86]Pooh.
[31:31.62]Use the furry spell.
[31:42.70]God, what is it?
[31:44.16]How do I do it?
[31:44.66]It's like... Wait, I can't...
[31:59.36]Doesn't everyone always feel like this is taking a lot longer than it should be when there's three low-level skeletons?
[32:05.37]God.
[32:09.69]Who is he making?
[32:10.39]That's pretty cool.
[32:21.54]Nice house.
[32:23.98]Ha ha ha ha.
[32:26.48]Nice house, dude.
[32:28.64]Really nice house.
[32:34.34]Go fight.
[32:34.76]Is there anything huge we can fight that I can just watch?
[32:38.28]I need to turn in my quests.
[32:39.18]Hold on.
[32:43.22]Give me a granny.
[32:44.00]Thank you.
[32:45.93]And then this guy over here.
[32:55.87]Come on, go.
[33:00.09]Fallout 76.
[33:00.39]Dark element, yeah.
[33:00.89]Alright, we're gonna go to the hedge maze.
[33:02.93]Do I still have a giant entourage with me?
[33:04.77]Now we got Pirates of the Caribbean Online is next.
[33:29.59]This is just how we're starting, because this was the joke that everybody wanted me to do.
[33:38.78]Didn't that close?
[33:39.58]It did.
[33:40.30]There is a full-on fan remake of the game that works and is online.
[33:45.98]I think it's just called like Pirates Online or something.
[33:51.25]Don't ever change from this game.
[33:54.74]You want to Toontown so bad?
[33:55.88]So did I. I want to Toontown more than anybody, probably.
[33:59.43]Couldn't get it to work.
[34:01.99]I'm not high enough level yet to do that.
[34:05.19]Neither am I, so we're fine.
[34:11.65]Does anybody know of a game that is free or very cheap where we can put like a thousand people in the same server?
[34:26.85]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[34:27.91]I don't want to, no, no, no.
[34:28.55]Don't, nobody walk in the circle.
[34:29.77]No, don't.
[34:30.37]I'm fleeing.
[34:34.41]What?
[34:34.65]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[34:35.69]What's with the loading screen?
[34:38.25]What?
[34:38.43]Where the hell did it just put me?
[34:44.86]Planetside?
[34:47.42]You want to just... Alright, so one of the next things I want to do, I want to get planetside too.
[34:52.46]And we all have to sit in the same house.
[34:56.69]Is PlanetSide free?
[35:00.88]Why am I so far away from everything?
[35:02.82]What's going on here?
[35:05.50]PlanetSide 2 is free!
[35:10.24]When did that happen?
[35:11.32]Hold on a minute, is it on Steam?
[35:25.81]Planetside 2.
[35:26.72]Because we all have to get in the same game and guard one house.
[35:35.76]Is it on?
[35:36.42]Planetside 2.
[35:37.07]There it is.
[35:37.53]Damn.
[35:37.95]Okay.
[35:39.35]Damn.
[35:39.79]I didn't think this was free.
[35:41.73]Alright, I'm downloading it right now.
[35:53.31]I've played this before, but I don't remember.
[35:54.79]I thought it was money.
[35:55.86]Whatever.
[35:56.14]Downloading.
[35:59.72]Alright, Planetside 2 is currently downloading.
[36:04.56]And we'll play that later.
[36:08.32]We can't play it that fast.
[36:09.34]Neither can I. I gotta download it.
[36:16.84]Get Toontown to work?
[36:17.84]I tried so hard.
[36:22.78]Why do they end up so far away here?
[36:32.53]Maple story?
[36:35.71]I need a personal tour of Roblox.
[36:43.68]Wait, we had $50 come in?
[36:44.60]Holy shit, I didn't even see it.
[36:54.14]Thank you so much, Cookie.
[36:56.17]CookieCRM, thank you so much for the $50.
[37:01.21]No, god damn it.
[37:01.91]I don't want to fight anything.
[37:04.85]Jeremy, you just upped the game's population by five times more than it's had in the past ten years.
[37:09.53]I imagine the devs are just sitting there and just saw this random spike and were like, holy shit.
[37:18.09]Well, the game looks kind of fun.
[37:22.02]Why is that the Shrek donkey?
[37:24.67]Was it like a Shrek crossover at some point?
[37:27.41]I need to walk up the sidewalk.
[37:30.36]But thank you so much, CookieCRM.
[37:32.70]Much appreciated, dude.
[37:34.58]Devs of the chat, maybe.
[37:37.60]I'm excited for Planetside now.
[37:39.32]I want us to all be in the same spot.
[37:41.10]I'm going to use the same weapon.
[37:42.88]Everybody has to be the same class.
[37:45.73]And we all have to be in the same house.
[37:53.01]Is that even possible?
[38:00.17]I made this.
[38:03.19]Which team?
[38:03.73]We'll figure that out when I open it.
[38:07.09]It's on PC.
[38:16.80]PlanetSide takes four hours to download.
[38:20.12]Well, you better start downloading it now!
[38:25.64]Alright, finally.
[38:26.50]I don't know how I got so turned around here.
[38:31.40]Is it going to happen on this stream?
[38:32.72]It depends on when it's done.
[38:36.05]Pirates of the Caribbean Online will happen very soon here.
[38:41.01]We've got to give each one of these like an hour.
[38:42.45]And then I'm going to give you my final assessment on the game.
[38:49.28]Oh, praise the light.
[38:50.60]Someone has come at last.
[38:52.28]Something has been corrupting my fairies.
[38:55.14]Since you have come in my hour of need... Didn't I kill this lady in Dark Souls?
[39:00.78]Thank you for coming at this dark time.
[39:03.32]If you are as brave as you look, I know you will help save my fairies.
[39:08.48]Please go out to Unicorn Wade.
[39:10.86]I know it is a dark task, but it must be done.
[39:14.16]Take care, wizard.
[39:16.20]Alright, let's go.
[39:16.88]Let's do it.
[39:19.73]Host first of all why have I not done the streamer the youtuber thing alright guys everybody get over here and get in a line And I want everybody to do the most epic funny dance you could possibly do for a screen grab buzz Line up And I'm gonna tweet this out, and it's gonna be like fun with the boys right huh oh
[39:50.12]Get in fucking line!
[39:51.28]I just asked you something!
[40:06.89]Oh, whatever.
[40:11.72]Like he pretends to be so cool and nice and...
[40:16.76]I need my thumbnail for my fucking video.
[40:19.46]Get over here.
[40:20.84]Get in there.
[40:30.24]Play Pirate 101?
[40:31.12]Is that the same thing as Pirates of the Caribbean?
[40:36.92]Oh no.
[40:41.26]Please go away.
[40:46.45]Pirates of the Caribbean Online actually looks pretty good.
[40:51.95]Am I fighting?
[40:53.11]No.
[40:57.46]Please go away.
[40:58.30]Please go away.
[41:05.23]Spiral Knights is good too.
[41:07.63]I've actually played Spiral Knights before.
[41:10.33]It was actually not bad.
[41:19.06]Oh yeah, don't worry, we're gonna play Planetside tonight.
[41:22.62]It has to download.
[41:25.23]So I'm assuming by the time we're done with pirates online, Planetside will be ready and we can defend one room.
[41:38.16]You don't have the hard drive space for Planetside?
[41:45.97]Play World of Warcraft?
[41:48.47]No, that's... No.
[41:51.19]You want to talk about a long download.
[41:52.59]That game has like 75 gigabyte.
[42:03.88]Thanks for completing the quest with your giant meteor spell, man.
[42:08.70]Alright, time to collect it.
[42:15.85]Try Toontown again.
[42:16.95]Run Toontown as an admin.
[42:18.15]Oh, I tried everything.
[42:20.17]I tried installing it in different directories, administrative mode, reinstalling it, installing it on other drives, updating things.
[42:29.36]No, I just can't.
[42:30.44]I can't even get past the launch screen.
[42:32.54]You have returned with the fairy dust.
[42:34.70]Please give it to me so that I can investigate.
[42:36.84]Lady Oreo looks visibly shaken.
[42:39.22]They have been enchanted by something that is undead.
[42:42.06]This does not bode well.
[42:44.38]How has evil become so brazen in this place?
[42:48.42]I have heard that someone has... Please, you must free the captain fairies from those horrible bone cages before they become corrupted.
[42:55.91]Go quickly, my friend.
[42:57.17]Where's my character screen?
[43:05.79]This shit is... It's really complicated.
[43:11.01]PVP.
[43:11.65]I can't do it yet.
[43:13.47]Backpack.
[43:13.89]Here we go.
[43:16.71]Starter deck.
[43:18.83]Canvas cover.
[43:19.84]Okay, I got an opal band.
[43:24.84]I have a hat.
[43:26.38]I got some new shoes.
[43:28.86]Okay.
[43:29.62]Alright, nice.
[43:30.88]Looking good.
[43:33.37]Let's go.
[43:37.30]Play Second Life?
[43:38.26]Uh, I would, but Second Life is banned on Twitch.
[43:41.48]You physically cannot open that game on stream.
[43:44.48]Or you will be banned.
[43:46.52]I actually thought about that, and I was like, oh, wait, but Second Life would be fun.
[43:48.95]No, I can't.
[43:55.55]Can I open a bone cage?
[43:56.89]Nah.
[43:57.41]Nah.
[44:01.88]Why is it banned?
[44:02.62]It just is.
[44:04.76]It is banned on Twitch.
[44:10.59]It's probably for the best.
[44:12.27]That's all porn.
[44:22.19]How many people can be on one team in Planet Scythe?
[44:27.77]Do we have to make like a custom game?
[44:31.54]We might be able to do that.
[44:35.54]Like, custom game with a custom password.
[44:40.14]There could be thousands of people in Planetside 2.
[44:41.86]Okay, so we're just gonna go to the one house to defend.
[44:53.78]Okay.
[44:55.56]That sounds like fun.
[45:03.58]They gotta build a city in there.
[45:05.24]Gonna crash the server?
[45:08.97]No, they can handle it.
[45:09.63]They got like 5,000 employees on each server.
[45:14.17]In each house.
[45:16.49]PlanetSide 2 has server limits.
[45:25.24]Your viewers won't be able to log in.
[45:28.12]Well, we'll try.
[45:30.86]Worth a shot.
[45:32.31]What is hanging out there?
[45:35.65]Not doing anything too elaborate.
[45:39.09]Just trying out some of these old free MMOs.
[45:40.63]You know, give me a second.
[45:42.33]Look.
[45:43.23]Maybe you missed this one 15 years ago.
[45:45.34]Maybe you'll check it out.
[45:53.46]I haven't even done anything.
[45:56.08]I'm pretty sure I clicked on one button.
[46:02.35]Oh, wait, I gotta open the cages.
[46:03.35]How many do I need?
[46:07.95]Four cages.
[46:09.95]No.
[46:10.35]Let's stick to the sidewalk.
[46:13.44]Play Habbo Hotel.
[46:15.02]What is that?
[46:17.66]Habbo Ho- What is this?
[46:26.25]What?
[46:27.05]Friend finder code?
[46:29.49]What does that even-
[46:32.05]I can't even click on the thing.
[46:39.48]I don't know what it is.
[46:42.36]Is that a bad thing or is that a good thing?
[46:47.48]Don't do it.
[46:47.98]It's a meme.
[46:53.86]It's like Club Penguin.
[46:55.02]Well, I already have Club Penguin installed, so we're going to play that.
[47:04.88]Alright, complete.
[47:06.88]Back around this way.
[47:07.62]Oh, why is this open?
[47:15.19]You don't install Club Penguin?
[47:16.53]Yeah, you do.
[47:18.19]Guys, I have like the new cleaned up Disney version.
[47:21.27]With the client.
[47:23.01]What do you mean, ew?
[47:36.51]It's shut down.
[47:41.07]No, there's a... I downloaded Disney.com Club Penguin and I... It asked for my credit card!
[47:46.82]What are you guys talking about?
[47:47.84]Hold on.
[47:52.70]The thing that asked for my credit card is not Club Penguin.
[48:03.87]Don't even tell me that's what's going on here.
[48:13.50]Unplug your computer.
[48:16.14]Quick.
[48:18.12]No, it's not legit.
[48:20.20]Hold on.
[48:21.48]You guys are scaring the shit out of me right now.
[48:24.98]This is from the Disney website.
[48:31.32]Okay, it's legit.
[48:32.88]I'm actually sitting here going, what did I do?
[48:34.90]I didn't even put it in.
[48:38.39]It asked for my credit card.
[48:40.85]I just put in my full name and address.
[48:48.26]And to show my appreciation, we must now find out who is behind the corruption.
[48:54.05]Check my bank?
[48:56.63]What?
[48:57.15]Did somebody send me like 500 million dollars?
[48:59.63]Yeah, Club Penguin Island.
[49:03.37]That's not the right thing.
[49:04.19]Call my bank?
[49:04.85]Oh, I thought you guys meant check my bank in this game.
[49:08.19]Alright, hold on.
[49:12.27]PlanetSide 2 is done.
[49:14.15]Give me one second.
[49:15.27]I need to like open it.
[49:17.16]Because it probably has a patch to get.
[49:22.24]Let's open the launcher.
[49:32.13]Check my bald cone.
[49:33.33]Actually, I don't think I can open it.
[49:37.85]That's not a club penguin.
[49:40.92]I think I have to close this to open that launcher.
[49:44.25]Alright, this is going to save my character, right?
[49:45.55]Because I just need to start.
[49:47.09]Alright, I'm going to save and quit here.
[49:48.43]Are you sure it wasn't like didney.com?
[49:53.95]No, it wasn't didney.com.
[49:57.63]Just hold on a second.
[49:58.43]I need to make sure that I'm not in trouble here.
[50:03.95]Okay, open Planetside 2.
[50:05.59]I'm just going to get it going.
[50:09.71]This is going to be so much fun.
[50:10.77]I actually can't wait to do this.
[50:13.59]If this is actually possible for us to do... Oh, I'm going to have lots of fun here.
[50:17.29]Alright, here comes the launcher.
[50:20.01]I had to close that.
[50:25.87]Asking if it saves this character in an online game.
[50:28.03]I don't know.
[50:28.47]Let me put it on the VRP screen for a second.
[50:32.40]I'm not going anywhere, but just, you know, it's a black screen.
[50:36.66]Oh, enter a Daybreak username.
[50:38.82]Oh, for the love of God.
[50:42.09]I don't even know.
[50:42.85]I'm going to have to make a new one with some bogus, like, hold on.
[50:49.41]Daybreak.
[50:50.13]I thought Daybreak closed.
[50:53.11]Is this closed too?
[50:55.06]Okay.

[54:00.63]Do we have people ready to play this?
[54:03.31]Because I'm ready to go into Planetside 2 right now.
[54:10.57]No.
[54:10.73]I've seen a lot of no's.
[54:13.61]Not yet, not yet.
[54:15.09]We'll hold this off.
[54:15.94]This is the climax of the whole stream.
[54:17.52]So we're going to close this.
[54:22.78]Let's do pirates.
[54:24.42]I got like three of these loaded up here.
[54:27.84]Legend of Pirates Online.
[54:29.16]I got to delete.
[54:40.54]Delete, delete, delete, delete, delete.
[54:44.96]Checking for updates.
[54:46.02]Let's pull back over here.
[54:52.42]Game capture is over this way.
[54:54.80]Hey, look at that.
[54:56.24]Legend of Pirates Online.
[54:57.80]Take a look.
[55:01.31]Oh, this is crashing.
[55:03.07]Uh-oh.
[55:05.11]Oops.
[55:08.67]Hey, look at that.
[55:11.06]This is the Pirates of the Caribbean MMO that was reimagined and redone by some fans.
[55:19.63]Okay, I put my hands together like I squeezed my hands and arms together and air came out of my stomach.
[55:28.41]Holy shit, that was weird.
[55:30.11]That wasn't even a burp.
[55:30.83]That was just air.
[55:31.42]I had extra air down here.
[55:33.76]And I put my hands together like, here I come.
[55:36.20]Like, imagine me, I'm like a chess machine.
[55:37.70]I'm folding my arms forward.
[55:40.02]And like, you know, the pillow thing, the billows, the billows, the bellows, the billows, the billower that you do with the fire.
[55:47.66]You know what I'm saying?
[55:57.71]Billow.
[55:58.65]It's a billow.
[56:00.57]Let me type this in.
[56:02.37]A billow.
[56:04.61]A large undulating mass of something, typically cloud.
[56:08.79]No, that's not it.
[56:09.95]Whatever.
[56:10.33]Pirates of the Caribbean, not Pirates of the Caribbean Online.
[56:15.52]I don't really know how this works.
[56:19.30]But by the way, this is absolutely, this is not the Disney version.
[56:23.34]There's my fucking username.
[56:24.84]So that's great.
[56:25.40]That's just showing up on here.
[56:28.68]Create a pirate.
[56:37.97]What is the knockoff song?
[56:39.21]Well, here's the funny thing.
[56:41.35]This whole game is a gigantic knockoff of... This whole game might, in fact, be illegal.
[56:47.51]I don't know.
[56:48.83]I'm just observing?
[56:49.95]Oh, it sure is illegal.
[56:55.43]Oh, okay.
[56:59.36]Well, now it's certain that it's illegal.
[57:04.04]Who is that?
[57:04.50]Captain, like, Jack Parrow?
[57:06.14]Alright, let's make him a coat hanger.
[57:17.42]No, big guy.
[57:18.78]Big guy.
[57:21.57]I like how huge he is with frayed out arms.
[57:25.19]Yeah, he's going to be like a Gaston.
[57:28.43]Face.
[57:29.19]Shape.
[57:34.96]Okay, let's thin his face out a little bit.
[57:36.90]A little bit less roundness.
[57:43.58]That's fine.
[57:44.70]Oh, shit.
[57:45.17]Wait.
[57:45.45]Hold on.
[57:50.90]I like this one.
[57:53.78]Next.
[57:57.04]Jaw, he can have a big jaw.
[57:58.49]I'm gonna have a chiseled jaw.
[58:05.63]Okay, looking good.
[58:11.04]Not bad.
[58:12.70]Cheeks.
[58:17.85]Okay, yeah, it's starting to look, um, closer, I think.
[58:27.56]Mega Chad.
[58:29.05]Uh...
[58:42.81]Okay, that's fine.
[58:44.39]Nose.
[58:45.88]Let's shrink the nose a little.
[58:47.02]He doesn't need to have that big of a nose.
[58:51.86]Bump.
[58:54.40]This, like, actually looks like my face.
[58:55.96]Alright, somebody just, like, somebody grabbed this guy by his head and squished in his nose with their thumb.
[59:12.81]Alright.
[59:13.03]Alright, that looks good.
[59:24.22]This is my Fallout 4 character, that's right.
[59:26.88]Pretty close.
[59:30.77]Stop doing that.
[59:34.03]Hair.
[59:38.33]Jesus Christ.
[59:46.49]No, none of that.
[59:47.17]Should I have a mustache?
[59:52.03]No, that's like Freddie Mercury.
[59:53.57]We're doing this.
[59:56.64]Hair color.
[59:59.64]He's dabbing.
[60:00.66]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[60:01.94]He's doing the thing.
[60:02.66]He's doing the dab thing, isn't he?
[60:06.33]I didn't... Why does this always have to happen in these games?
[60:10.37]Alright, we're gonna give him the referee shirt.
[60:15.25]No belt.
[60:16.99]And can I do no pants?
[60:21.95]No, I can't.
[60:22.85]Well, the shorts are fine.
[60:29.96]One of those old-fashioned strongmen.
[60:32.74]Choose your name.
[60:34.36]This may be the same company.
[60:35.40]Why is it the same three-name thing?
[60:37.12]Dog, dog, dog, burn bread.
[60:41.59]Okay, Dog.
[60:43.25]Destiny.
[60:44.33]Davy.
[60:45.09]David.
[60:47.50]Dashing.
[60:51.94]Dashing Bulgebeard.
[60:57.36]Danger Blastbeard.
[60:59.77]Blastbane.
[61:02.53]Bellows.
[61:02.99]See, I told you.
[61:04.25]Dashing.
[61:08.61]Dashing Bravebowers.
[61:12.68]Larry.
[61:12.96]I don't think we're going to have Larry in this game, man.
[61:16.81]Jack.
[61:17.65]Jeffrey.
[61:18.37]John.
[61:19.47]No Larry.
[61:20.65]They have Lawrence.
[61:21.65]They have Larry.
[61:23.19]Larry.
[61:23.57]How about Lawrence?
[61:34.12]Chip burn.
[61:36.26]Lawrence chip crash.
[61:38.24]This is fucking horrible.
[61:40.41]Chipcutter!
[61:41.11]Lawrence Chipcutter!
[61:42.97]That is like a MegaChad name.
[61:44.73]He's like a lawyer.
[61:46.57]Lawrence Chipcutter.
[61:49.49]Type your name.
[61:56.50]No, that's Lawrence Chipcutter.
[62:07.08]No foul language.
[62:14.58]Under, what do you mean?
[62:21.10]No friend names.
[62:31.12]I don't think we're going to get approved with that one.
[62:43.79]Until your name is approved, you've been given a temporary name.
[62:45.89]That was just being a dick.
[62:48.53]It really was.
[62:50.35]Is that actually Johnny Depp?
[62:52.83]I don't fit in this world.
[62:53.75]I'm like a different universe.
[62:54.71]Arrow keys or WASD.
[63:16.89]I even run like a dickhead.
[63:18.85]Can I open up the cell with the dog?
[63:26.07]Yeah, this character belongs in a separate universe.
[63:29.25]Level 1.
[63:30.23]Shift is opening doors.
[63:31.82]Do you want to follow Jack into the tutorial on how to be a pirate?
[63:34.36]Yeah, I do.
[63:35.14]Yeah, I do.
[63:40.10]Space bars jump, walk, sail.
[63:42.84]Walk towards the light ray.
[63:43.68]Enter the old warehouse to get a sword.
[63:48.34]Damn.
[63:52.17]Pretty good for a fucking 2004 game.
[63:59.65]Use the right mouse button to aim your pistol and control the game's camera.
[64:02.46]Are we gonna be like fighting as pirates together and shit in this game?
[64:07.50]On my word.
[64:08.44]Do as I say or I'll run you through.
[64:10.12]No, it's Orlando Bloomin' Onion.
[64:11.81]I know that guy.
[64:12.35]Unarmed?
[64:13.47]Wait.
[64:14.15]I was going to say outcast.
[64:15.73]No.
[64:16.17]Please, accept my apologies.
[64:17.19]Outback Steakhouse.
[64:18.03]Can't be too cautious.
[64:20.37]Well, you aren't much use unarmed.
[64:22.03]This better not be a card game.
[64:23.07]I'll fucking delete it immediately.
[64:25.35]Here.
[64:27.21]The blade's a bit rusty.
[64:29.04]Not well balanced.
[64:29.80]Teach me how to play?
[64:30.74]But it should suffice for the present.
[64:32.72]Not familiar with the blade?
[64:35.66]That practice dummy will do.
[64:38.89]This better not be a cartoon.
[64:42.97]Click to draw your weapon.
[64:43.89]Oh, no.
[64:44.71]It's not.
[64:45.05]This is going to be so much fun.
[64:46.73]I can't wait.
[64:47.31]You're going to blow me out with the music here.
[64:49.44]Hold on.
[64:49.66]Oh, shit.
[64:49.94]Oh.
[65:06.35]I tried to open up the sound menu.
[65:09.01]This game is made for... There's probably three options to swing.
[65:22.59]Right mouse button is aim.
[65:23.91]It's probably very self-explanatory.
[65:27.85]Okay.
[65:28.71]Pirates.
[65:29.11]Here we go.
[65:36.58]This game's great.
[65:37.80]What were you guys talking about?
[65:39.60]This is awesome.
[65:42.46]We're gonna be able to play this together?
[65:43.73]Is that what you're trying to tell me?
[65:45.01]Okay, that's better.
[65:50.85]Alright, now this is tolerable.
[66:04.77]That 32-year-old boomer that likes Pirates of the Caribbean.
[66:08.27]What are you talking about?
[66:10.45]What?
[66:10.55]What do you mean a boomer?
[66:12.07]I can't wait till we play.
[66:13.75]You know how many people... We're going to try to get 100 people on one boat, and then I'm going to drive it into a rock.
[66:36.06]Use the cannon.
[66:39.08]Reload.
[66:47.62]This is going to be fucking fun.
[66:50.50]Calm down, man.
[66:51.36]Hold on.
[67:02.85]Sea of Thieves.
[67:03.39]This is going to be more fun than Sea of Thieves.
[67:13.18]Where's escape?
[67:15.09]Hold your fire!
[67:17.19]It's Jolly Roger, and he's got us dead to rights!
[67:26.95]Don't worry.
[67:28.35]I'll handle this.
[67:30.36]I'm gonna get captured by Jolly Roger.
[67:32.22]Where's that yellow-covered sparrow?
[67:36.75]Beck, we had a deal.
[67:39.75]I could go for a Jolly Rancher right now.
[67:41.07]Sparrow paid me double what you was paying.
[67:43.31]A pretty piece of profit, too.
[67:45.47]So, here's your gold back.
[67:46.65]Of course, I was going to reimburse you, as it were.
[67:51.38]Why would they be giving us gore?
[67:54.98]Looks like the price of loyalty just went up, eh?
[67:59.00]What?
[67:59.84]Can't take a joke?
[68:00.88]How do I get a Jolly Rancher out of my... Never mind.
[68:05.92]Whoa.
[68:07.48]Dead men tell no tales.
[68:11.30]I heard that last one was bad, by the way.
[68:14.62]The title of the movie that he just said I heard was not good.
[68:16.32]Just make sure Jack Sparrow knows I'm coming for him.
[68:22.00]Said I'll be letting you live.
[68:25.02]The sharks may not be so charitable.
[68:30.48]What are you waiting for?
[68:32.66]See, that's what we're talking about when I talk about the swimming ship.
[68:39.10]That sucks.
[68:40.70]That was Jack Sparrow's boat.
[68:45.44]That was like a fucking Walgreens toy.
[68:47.97]Alright, weapon switching.
[68:50.29]Alternative attack button is control.
[68:53.70]And you can scroll alternative weapon switch over the mouse button.
[68:56.56]I gotta remember that.
[69:01.45]Defeat three undead gravediggers in the graveyard before you visit Tia Dalma.
[69:05.97]Fourth of July, go to the shores of Port Royal to watch fireworks light up the sky.
[69:11.03]Are you guys, are you guys friends?
[69:19.28]Well, they're all level one.

[70:10.97]I'm busy, come back later.
[70:11.94]Oh man, I don't think this is gonna end well.

[70:22.42]Oh, boy.
[70:23.38]Okay.
[70:24.56]Oh, the ray of light, it leads you to your quest.
[70:26.58]What ray of light are they referring to?
[70:38.27]Ray of light.
[70:43.59]How do you invite?
[70:44.85]Where do we go?
[70:45.53]Is it level 31?
[70:52.17]Hey!
[70:53.85]Easy.
[70:54.15]Where are these undead gravediggers?
[70:59.13]We're all in this together, so let's go.
[71:07.00]Oh, man.
[71:07.50]This can't handle it.
[71:08.76]This is having trouble.
[71:18.62]Is that an undead guy?
[71:20.55]Why is there a random British guy here?
[71:35.21]Oh, that guy didn't last long.
[71:38.67]Where's this ray of light?
[71:46.12]What's wrong with my character?
[71:50.76]Follow the ray of light.
[72:02.43]Map.
[72:02.75]Okay, hold on.
[72:03.41]Port Royale.
[72:05.61]Teleport to island.
[72:06.57]No, I can't do anything about this.
[72:18.79]Let's just go in the front door.
[72:20.85]Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
[72:26.58]What is going on over here?
[72:38.26]We have to all get on a boat, guys.
[72:40.74]New crew.
[72:41.24]You've joined a crew.
[72:45.82]Did I go in the house?
[72:53.17]Yeah, we have to get like all these hundred people on the same boat.
[72:55.68]You want to see me?
[72:56.18]I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.
[72:58.28]I'll shit my pants laughing if we get like a hundred people on a boat and half of them will fall off.
[73:03.00]Alright, invasions fleets and now the Queen hands revenge.
[73:05.04]Time for some conflict.
[73:10.64]Follow the ray of light.
[73:19.43]Look in the sky.
[73:23.15]The frame rate, yeah, that's because the server can't handle a thousand people here.
[73:33.92]Oh my god.
[73:42.03]Alright, look at the sky.
[73:43.11]I can't see anything.
[73:49.69]How do we get out of here?
[73:52.77]What do I need to do?
[73:56.88]Y. K. B. H. J. Defeat three- Track it!
[74:05.80]Track this!
[74:09.76]So where is it?
[74:16.35]Defeat the skeletons.
[74:17.41]Track.
[74:28.88]Oh my god, someone's spamming fireworks.
[74:33.82]Defeat three undead gravediggers on Port Royale.
[74:42.29]Just gonna have to walk around.
[74:48.53]Ooh, I'm developing a limp.
[75:08.69]Somebody find a skeleton.
[75:10.53]Somebody find a... Pirate is issuing you a challenge.
[75:14.85]What just happened?
[75:22.21]The game crashed.
[75:33.68]Okay, we need to get to the end of this.
[75:36.46]We're not done with this.
[75:37.54]Seriously.
[75:39.84]This has so much potential for us to get on a goddamn boat and do something.
[75:54.07]We have to see what this is all about.
[75:55.81]We have to go look around.
[76:06.45]Add Jeremiah Goldweather and I will show you where to go.
[76:10.58]We gotta find Jeremiah Goldweather.
[76:17.54]We gotta find him in the crowd.
[76:20.98]Keep your eyes peeled, that's who you need to look for.
[76:32.09]Okay, we're back.
[76:36.29]Everyone is not in this area.
[76:37.51]They're all at the house.
[76:40.55]Undead skeletons.
[76:41.71]All right.
[76:41.97]Jeremiah Goldweather.
[76:45.31]We're in Port Royale right now.
[76:47.07]What's that?
[76:47.87]Skeleton?
[76:48.41]No.
[76:53.49]They're coming.
[76:55.05]This is going to be insane to look at, by the way.
[76:56.58]Let's see.
[77:05.32]Just wait.
[77:07.69]Hold on.
[77:09.59]Just wait a sec.
[77:16.87]Hold on.
[77:30.48]Where'd they all go?
[77:31.28]I think everybody crashed.
[77:32.38]Oh, okay.
[77:33.82]This looks like a graveyard to me.
[77:35.84]Found it.
[77:44.42]Different server?
[77:45.18]How can we tell what server I'm in?
[77:48.76]I don't know.
[77:51.82]The game's not loading anymore.
[77:58.80]Well, at least I figured out how to do the tutorial.
[78:04.11]Alright, we're in... Exuma Ocean is the server.
[78:14.47]Exuma Ocean.
[78:17.09]Everybody get in here, because you guys have to do this too.
[78:24.60]I'll wait for everybody to get here.
[78:25.66]Because everybody has to do this.
[78:35.68]Alright, walk through here to visit...
[78:48.66]That's what the beam of light looks like.
[78:53.60]Why would I tell the name?
[78:55.00]Because we need to get everybody in here.
[79:01.56]Everyone's coming online.
[79:02.48]The clouds lie true.
[79:04.36]There's a touch of destiny in you.
[79:06.24]It's taking five times longer to load.
[79:08.32]But know that the skeleton you destroyed was nothing but a drop in the ocean.
[79:14.10]Charlie Rogers' servants are many.
[79:17.88]And most be far more dangerous.
[79:19.30]Oh my god, this guy's terrifying.
[79:23.38]Look now.
[79:26.04]From the darkness come the light.
[79:31.22]Let me see over here.
[79:34.85]Here come all the other server people.
[79:38.23]Here comes the other people on the server.
[79:41.85]No more this can be.
[79:54.22]I have a big ship, we need him to board it.
[79:56.70]Who's shooting a cannon?
[79:58.34]Stop shooting a cannon!
[79:59.16]Who wants to join Drunken Donut?
[80:18.02]You can pilot my ship.
[80:19.23]Alright.
[80:19.83]We're looking for Emily O. Fox.
[80:22.23]Okay, I'm ready.
[80:26.89]Darby is inviting you to join Drunken Donuts.
[80:38.00]Yes.
[80:39.76]Would you like to join the crew of... Yes, I would.
[80:42.96]How do I use the compass?
[80:44.88]The arrow points to your quest goal.
[80:47.26]Thank God.
[80:48.88]You're the arrow in the center.
[80:50.77]Yep.
[80:51.49]So that's... Enemies are shown in red.
[80:54.33]Town fork are green.
[80:55.07]Other players are blue.
[80:57.19]Sure.
[80:59.05]Okay.
[81:11.71]My fucking God.
[81:16.00]Okay, we have to kill the soldiers.
[81:24.42]Oh my god.
[81:25.06]Alright, where's Emily?
[81:26.80]Emily O'Fox, that's who we have to follow.
[81:32.89]This is the only person that matters right now.
[81:34.75]This person has a boat.
[81:37.69]I gotta kill this guy.
[81:39.21]Wait, what?
[81:42.97]No, wait.
[81:43.43]No, no, no.
[81:44.45]I lost her.
[81:45.15]Shit.
[81:45.87]Where'd she go?
[81:47.16]God damn it.
[81:47.70]I got it confused.
[81:56.32]Enter the governor's mansion to deliver release orders.
[82:05.09]This is too much, man.
[82:08.46]Emily, come back here.
[82:09.86]Emily, go to the beam of light in front of the manor.
[82:12.81]Emily's ship, Iron Maelstrom, is now being launched at Port Royale.
[82:15.89]Wait, board it!
[82:19.85]Don't crash.
[82:26.55]Don't crash.
[82:26.99]Come on.
[82:27.61]Get me on this boat.
[82:30.30]Oh, wow.
[82:30.90]Alright, we gotta get everybody else on here.
[82:40.03]There's Emily.
[82:40.39]Alright, Emily, you gotta take this thing to Port Royale.
[82:42.73]We gotta... Captain Rat.
[82:44.67]Alright, yeah.
[82:45.79]We need to go to Port Royale and pick up everybody.
[82:50.36]Is this how you drive?
[82:52.40]Oh, dear.
[82:53.02]Okay.
[82:58.14]How do we get to Port Royale from here?
[83:05.23]Yeah, you gotta make it public?
[83:09.81]Alright, let's go.
[83:10.29]We're gonna go pick up every single person.
[83:14.63]This is just a glo- Wait, what?
[83:21.02]I was gonna say, we're just gonna act as a glorified boat in World of Warcraft.
[83:24.34]Drop anchor!
[83:32.19]Did I drop anchor in the right place?
[83:39.28]Where's her boat?
[83:43.40]Oh, shit.
[83:47.93]Wait, bring it back.
[83:48.79]Bring the boat back.
[83:50.23]Oh, god damn it.
[83:51.93]You don't pick people up, they have to join in.
[83:53.89]Oh, god.
[83:55.41]Re-invite me.
[83:58.59]So, how do we invite everybody in?
[84:12.49]The boat is gone now.
[84:16.99]Okay, here we go.
[84:18.95]So, we need to pull in everybody.
[84:24.91]Everybody has to have a purpose on this boat.
[84:28.94]I don't care if you're swabbing the deck.
[84:30.16]I don't care if you're using a cannon.
[84:31.56]I don't care if you're swinging around.
[84:32.44]I don't care if you're dancing.
[84:33.34]There has to be a point for what you're doing.
[84:38.74]We're going to pull everybody on here.
[84:45.36]We have to sail to a very... We have to sail to the highest level zone in the game.
[84:52.48]How many people can fit on one boat?
[84:56.19]Number of shipments aboard ship.
[84:59.25]Alright.
[84:59.75]So how do I like... Is there a way I can open up like the map or the inventory?
[85:04.23]And just pull in people?
[85:13.17]Did I ask for parents' permission?
[85:14.65]I did.
[85:25.70]Well, you found us.
[85:27.70]How are you?
[85:29.38]Look, you can get it in your own boats too.
[85:31.59]It doesn't have to just be one big boat.
[85:34.97]Stop firing at us.
[85:36.07]Get out of here.
[85:52.42]Oh, you're stuck.
[85:53.40]Alright, I'm going to go for it.
[85:54.34]Next time he comes around, I'm jumping into the boat.
[86:02.73]Get out of here, you fucking landlubbers!
[86:06.35]Oh, God.
[86:07.31]What is it?
[86:07.61]Eight?
[86:08.41]Here comes another one.
[86:11.55]Wait, what did I just do?
[86:12.11]No, that's an anchor.
[86:13.23]Can I grab him?
[86:20.44]I don't even know what the fuck is happening right now.
[86:25.55]This is like so much stimulation.
[86:31.21]How many people do we... Alright, we have to go to the hardest area in the game.
[86:35.10]Jeffrey has a ship.
[86:36.14]Laughing Fox is being launched at Port Royale.
[86:39.28]Um... I don't... I can't...
[86:57.92]Where are you taking us?
[86:58.90]Can you sail us somewhere?
[87:00.10]I don't even have anything to say.
[87:10.29]I wish I had more to say about this.
[87:11.77]I just really don't.
[87:16.33]Here comes that guy again.
[87:26.43]Get me out of this.
[87:30.49]Are these other players?
[87:31.61]I can't even tell.
[87:37.62]Who's even firing at him?
[87:38.82]50% damage bonus, captain's orders.
[87:45.15]I got it.
[87:59.82]This is fucking wild, man.
[88:03.69]Somebody's sick.
[88:05.25]What the fuck is this guy doing?
[88:16.31]Get him!
[88:17.71]Don't let him get away!
[88:18.73]Fire!
[88:20.65]Did I grab his boat?
[88:27.03]Wait, I'm gonna jump on his boat.
[88:45.89]Stay there.
[88:46.61]Get off.
[88:46.93]Get me off.
[88:47.23]Get me off.
[88:49.70]Oh, I can't jump off of this boat?
[88:53.32]Oh my god, the game's crashing.
[88:54.89]Windows is freaking out right now.
[88:58.49]This is just a lightning storm.
[89:05.57]There's so many of these.
[89:20.29]Why are we still alive?
[89:23.98]Why are we not sunk yet?
[89:25.28]I don't even... There's more boats than there were players walking around.
[89:52.08]Get out of here.
[90:00.73]We need to land somewhere.
[90:02.03]Go anywhere.
[90:03.29]Get us out of here.
[90:09.45]Hold on.
[90:09.85]I gotta turn it down.
[90:10.81]It's too loud.
[90:16.12]Jesus Christ.
[90:21.04]We're like... That guy is in trouble.
[90:29.21]We're just bugs.
[90:30.69]We're ants in an anthill.
[90:43.42]I think we made it out alive.
[90:45.28]We made it out of the boat storm.
[90:50.02]Holy shit.
[90:52.04]That was fucking outrageous.
[90:55.30]I learned a new skill.
[90:56.79]Great.
[91:00.97]No, they're still chasing us.
[91:02.83]And you can't... Why can you not hurt other players' boats?
[91:06.81]Doesn't that make no sense?
[91:10.21]Oh, we're coming for you.
[91:14.45]They're faster.
[91:15.13]They're getting faster.
[91:18.41]What planetside class?
[91:19.75]Look at how tiny this guy is.
[91:23.34]Uh, I don't know.
[91:24.06]We'll talk about planetside in a minute.
[91:28.90]They're going real fast.
[91:30.10]Alright, slow this boat down.
[91:31.16]Slow the boat down.
[91:33.49]Remember, in Massachusetts, if you get rear-ended, it's always their fault no matter what.
[91:39.87]It's always their fault.
[91:41.89]Let's pick some insurance money up.
[91:45.09]Oh, fuck.
[91:54.87]Poor guy in the little boat over here.
[92:01.43]Oh, okay.
[92:03.33]No, no.
[92:04.47]Pepper O'Rat would like to be your friend.
[92:10.63]I don't know how our boat is still standing, to be honest.
[92:15.09]Are you taking... Where are we going?
[92:16.17]Where are we being taken?
[92:16.93]Those people are stuck inside of each other right now.
[92:24.77]Alright, we got a lot of people in the front here.
[92:27.29]Kill the sentinel.
[92:29.73]What is that?
[92:30.82]We're surrounded by boats.
[92:36.84]Does it even, does it say where our health is?
[92:44.11]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[92:44.89]We can board other boats.
[92:46.63]Shoot the grappling hooks.
[92:47.85]Hold on, wait.
[92:48.27]We can board these boats.
[92:52.22]The grappling hooks are to board the boats.
[92:53.86]All right, let's go.
[92:54.38]Go, go, go, go.
[92:54.82]Come on.
[92:58.03]They're on a...
[93:23.80]It's too much overload my brain I Have way too much in my brain.
[93:29.02]This is too much stimulation.
[93:30.28]Nobody can handle this much stimulation.
[93:33.10]I have to get out of the game Oh
[93:49.03]You have to land us somewhere, man.
[93:51.29]Get us into a port anywhere.
[93:56.76]Oh.
[94:06.50]We've all been dragged into the middle of the tornado.
[94:11.26]Oh.
[94:12.20]It's so loud.
[94:13.19]Stop.
[94:15.97]Oh.
[94:16.51]Get.
[94:18.15]Oh.
[94:21.73]At least we're on the good boat.
[94:26.67]Alright, that island.
[94:27.51]Right there.
[94:27.83]There's an island.
[94:30.51]Get on that island.
[94:31.91]I see it.
[94:33.25]Land ahead.
[94:38.59]We're gonna dock up here.
[94:42.91]Oh my god.
[94:43.69]What if this was... Can we get out?
[94:51.60]This is amazing.
[94:54.12]I can't believe I can handle this.
[94:57.26]Seriously, kudos to the people that have developed this game, because any other video game, even a AAA game, would have turned off.
[95:07.23]Oh, that was fucking hilarious.
[95:09.59]I got a bunch of stuff.
[95:14.39]I take it all.
[95:16.66]Alright, are we at like a hard area?
[95:20.01]Wait, we gotta wait for everybody.
[95:21.19]What level are these guys?
[95:21.95]These guys, okay, these guys, this, oh god, this is gonna be, I'm gonna fucking cry.
[95:27.67]Oh no, no, no, no, wait, wait, don't, nobody move, nobody move, nobody move, nobody go anywhere, hold on.
[95:32.53]Everybody stay here, don't fight the monster yet.
[95:36.47]No, don't fight the monster, don't pull him, he's level 30.
[95:43.46]Half of us are like level 10.
[95:46.63]We all have to go in together, otherwise we're going to get swarmed.
[95:54.29]Alright, with the count of three, we're going to go in there.
[95:58.89]Are you ready?
[96:02.09]This is Operation Try Not To Die, everybody.

[97:08.18]We're going to send in, like, the mice first.
[97:11.30]I want to see how much it takes for, like, 12 mice to kill an enemy here.

[98:54.23]No, no, no pirate chow.
[98:55.99]What is he doing?
[99:02.91]Is that a teammate doing that?
[99:12.31]Alright, well he's dead.

[99:25.23]Alright, let's see.
[99:29.09]We got level 2.
[99:29.65]This is going to end badly.
[99:34.84]He just teleported into the middle of the crowd.
[99:36.36]Alright, look around and look at all these small people.
[99:41.74]I feel like there are children in here.
[99:44.72]Yeah, we're gonna go loot inside the caverns.
[99:48.12]By the way, bring the children too.
[99:57.95]I found the boss.

[101:26.12]Wait, wait, let's play another game.
[101:28.40]Oh, I was going to say, hold your head underwater until you drown.
[101:31.34]But, oh wait, hold on.
[101:35.20]What happened here?
[101:36.59]Is this guy guarding the treasure?
[101:40.65]Oh, I'm dead.
[101:43.37]The game just crashed.
[101:49.79]Oh my god.
[102:09.80]That was insane.
[102:14.62]That was a lot of fun.
[102:18.02]It's time to play Planetside.
[102:25.70]Man, that was fucking fun.
[102:26.84]At least we killed the raid boss.
[102:36.21]Let's do a poll.
[102:38.22]to see if you've downloaded Planetside or not.
[102:41.85]Let's see how many, if it's more than like 60 or 70%, we're gonna just go.
[102:51.29]Oh my goodness, that was fucking funny.
[102:56.54]Those pirate ship bugs.
[102:59.92]Did you download it?
[103:03.52]Yes.
[103:05.68]Almost don't go.
[103:10.91]Play Roblox.
[103:15.77]Okay, here's your poll.
[103:18.89]You know when you get in one of those scenarios where there literally is nothing to say?
[103:24.57]Oh my goodness.
[103:27.31]I was just in pain laughing at that.
[103:33.82]So it looks like, right off the bat,
[103:37.01]It's about at least 40 to 45% of you guys that are not quite ready.
[103:45.65]By the way, that was The Legend of Pirates Online.
[103:51.91]It was... That was a lot of fun.
[103:55.66]So, we're not going to go just yet.
[103:58.78]Planetside 2, by the way.
[104:00.22]The one on Steam.
[104:02.82]And, I mean, your last opportunity, we're going into Club Penguin right now.
[104:12.07]Just for a moment.
[104:17.71]Until we get more people downloaded.
[104:22.61]This might be loud, hold on.
[104:23.59]Let me rescue you guys before it happens.
[104:34.17]Okay, game capture.
[104:35.25]Let's get it captured.
[104:39.99]Club Penguin Island.

[105:25.14]What the fuck?
[105:26.74]There we go.
[105:27.52]Okay.
[105:30.06]Alright, I'm ready to play Club Penguin Island.
[105:32.64]This is just the last game we just played, but probably way worse.
[105:35.43]Yeah, there's graphics in this one, don't you know?
[105:45.49]Trojan Trojan Trojan Trojan Oh
[106:13.21]Streaming Wizard 101.
[106:14.12]Oh, I should probably change that.
[106:18.44]We're waiting for Planetside.
[106:20.36]Move with the mouse.
[106:24.26]Get into the cannon.
[106:27.20]Press C to interact.
[106:32.39]Is everybody going to be here?
[106:36.09]We're just waiting for people to download.
[106:37.41]We're just going to do this Club Penguin game that sucks.
[106:41.69]Until then.
[106:44.69]We need to let Larry play for a little while after that.
[106:57.40]This is the last game.
[106:58.48]All right.
[107:02.17]All right.
[107:02.79]What happened to the rock hopper?
[107:03.95]I don't know.
[107:05.49]It's over there.
[107:05.91]It needs repairs.
[107:11.14]Just pretend that your little brother's playing right now.
[107:13.44]We need to take a break.
[107:18.93]That's my name?
[107:21.09]That's not my name?
[107:22.23]Um... CP5 will now do the 42 and 801111.
[107:35.66]My profile.
[107:36.66]Alright, I want to be... I want to be queen!
[107:44.37]No, let's be... Let's just be a floating nose and feet.
[107:54.10]Let's be the texture model that hasn't been painted yet.
[108:02.22]I can already tell this game sucks.
[108:07.08]Should have been Rayman.
[108:09.46]Oh, here they come!
[108:10.40]Hey, look, it's everybody!
[108:12.97]It's all of my friends!
[108:16.46]We're gonna go on adventures!
[108:17.58]I don't have any items.
[108:25.14]Is that person dressed in a full costume?
[108:30.91]Oh, here we are.
[108:32.03]I just worried about what's gonna happen to him.
[108:33.85]Oh, fuck.
[108:34.39]People are playing this game.
[108:36.49]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[108:40.35]No, guys, guys, guys.
[108:41.47]People are, like, playing the game.
[108:42.79]No, no, no, no, no.
[108:48.24]No, we're going to ruin Larry's time on his computer.
[108:56.31]God damn it.
[109:14.82]I don't even want to.
[109:17.83]I don't want... I... Let's just jump on the trampoline for a minute.
[109:22.61]Everybody get over to the trampoline and have some fun.
[109:33.06]Okay, that was fun.
[109:39.32]Please don't make yourself a white penguin because we're going to get lost inside of each other.
[109:43.78]Please don't do that.
[109:54.09]Jackhammer.
[109:58.84]What's going on?
[110:00.26]Z, Z, X, C. Just wait till we get on our own island.
[110:17.30]Is there one more leak?
[110:25.61]We got to get out of the hub world.
[110:26.59]You saved the migrator.
[110:28.63]Thank you.
[110:30.19]Wait, what?
[110:30.43]What do you mean, what?
[110:33.51]You deserve your starter kit, too.
[110:36.21]Coins.
[110:37.01]You should see Antarctic to open that starter kit.
[110:41.04]Okay, open the starter kit.
[110:42.98]How's auto?
[110:45.18]Well, you can throw.
[110:46.82]How do you throw snowballs?
[110:52.51]Your immersion is ruined.
[110:53.77]I don't know.
[111:00.04]I'm not gonna do it.
[111:00.76]Alright, I'm gonna do it.
[111:08.25]Oh, yeah, so... That person's phone number wants to be your friend.
[111:19.01]No, I... Goddammit, no.
[111:22.02]No, I won't do it.
[111:23.28]I won't do it.
[111:25.00]I won't do it.
[111:32.34]I can't even click on this...
[111:34.54]I won't do it.
[111:35.00]What do we get?
[111:44.34]A hat?
[111:44.90]A t-shirt?
[111:46.54]New blueprints for... We gotta get the Merlin hat.
[111:48.84]Okay, cool.
[111:49.72]New fabric.

[112:37.00]Club Penguin!
[112:37.72]It's my favorite game!
[112:38.64]Is that it?
[112:47.25]Alright, buy it.
[112:54.95]I can't wear it.
[112:56.39]I have to buy the game to wear clothes.
[112:59.16]I'd show you around more.
[113:01.20]I found the lighthouse has frozen over and gone dark.
[113:08.11]Without it, getting to our island isn't safe.
[113:11.55]Go, get, I gotta do the zipline.
[113:13.65]Pick up some coins.
[113:14.93]When I get adventure complete, I get some coins and some experience.
[113:20.66]Level up.
[113:24.30]But they always just, like, they feed you this, like, lights and sounds and level up, level up, level up.
[113:29.35]Box, box, box, box.
[113:31.21]To condition your child, Larry, to open up boxes for the rest of their life.

[113:43.60]New emojis, look at that.
[113:45.80]Please condition me more.
[113:49.62]New adventures?
[113:56.04]Oh my god.
[113:57.54]Oh my fucking god, stop it.
[114:05.49]Check out Island Live on your CPI phone to find rewards and special events.
[114:11.19]And there's a spinning wheel in this game.
[114:14.50]This game hates children.
[114:22.78]Okay, daily activities.
[114:24.22]Let's make the cut.
[114:26.07]Team dance battle.
[114:27.05]I only have nine seconds left to do this.
[114:34.88]Star of the show.
[114:35.64]Use the starfish emoji between two stars in Island Central.
[114:42.57]How do you double?
[114:43.03]How do you dance?
[114:47.31]I'm on team blue.
[114:50.41]How do you do emojis?
[114:51.67]Star emoji.
[114:52.33]Where is it?
[114:52.83]No, what was it?
[115:00.56]I almost clicked it.
[115:01.28]It was close.
[115:06.42]This is going to be bad.
[115:07.96]I'm not ready for this.
[115:08.76]I don't know how ready for this I am.
[115:26.80]Somebody has to join the red team.
[115:32.54]Oh my god.
[115:33.72]I can't do anything right now.
[115:34.90]I'm in the middle of a dance competition.
[115:36.58]Oh my god, I don't know about this.
[115:57.65]What?
[115:58.57]Oh, wait, let me do this.
[116:13.50]Someone just is on their phone in the middle of this.
[116:19.80]I already screwed it up.
[116:21.60]I understand it now.
[116:22.48]I get it.
[116:25.74]Purple, purple, teal, green, purple.
[116:30.05]Purple, purple, teal, green, purple.
[116:31.57]I'm going to win this one.
[116:42.68]I'm just waiting for a boat to crash into this.
[116:46.25]What have they done to Club Penguin?
[116:56.71]There's one dude in the lazy river over here.
[117:01.10]Where's Jeremy?
[117:03.12]Hey, that's the funny thing.
[117:03.86]Nobody knows my name.
[117:05.06]I could be anybody.
[117:08.60]It's impossible to find out where I am.
[117:11.00]I mean, if you look at the stream, you can find me.
[117:14.32]Purple, purple, green, green, purple, purple.
[117:19.35]Why is it an ugly mobile game now?
[117:20.93]Because Disney bought it.
[117:22.35]And turned it into this.
[117:28.99]The best free MMOs.
[117:30.73]I don't know about best.
[117:45.38]The boy's going through a lot right now.
[117:47.55]God.
[117:54.33]Uh.
[117:55.79]I won.
[117:58.43]Knowledge is free.
[117:59.43]Spread the word.
[118:00.17]Why is it so big?
[118:14.25]What was wrong with that?
[118:16.62]I asked, where do I get clothes?
[118:29.35]Why is it censoring that?
[118:38.91]I can't even tell sometimes who.
[118:40.09]All right, the igloo train.
[118:43.87]What's trending?
[118:46.14]Go to my igloo.
[118:46.94]All right, so I get my own igloo.
[118:51.94]Create a new igloo.
[118:54.68]Location, it's gotta be this one, that's fine.
[118:58.30]Buildings.
[119:01.12]Buildings come in three sizes.
[119:05.24]Go to the catalog to buy more.
[119:07.30]Click here to continue, okay.
[119:12.25]I don't have anything.
[119:14.92]Should I invite everybody here?
[119:15.96]Okay, catalog.

[121:48.64]Nothing.
[121:48.80]Alright, so we're going to play Planetside now.
[122:01.36]That was Club Penguin, the Disney version.
[122:03.34]It was very fun.
[122:04.12]Time to open Planetside.
[122:11.07]Is my house in Vegas going to be this small?
[122:15.41]If I hold it too long, will it explode my hand?
[122:17.92]No, it's not a grenade, you fucking idiot.
[122:19.56]All right.
[122:21.28]Thanks for playing, all you 12994858515462.
[122:22.68]Thanks a lot for playing, man.
[122:24.42]Very special thanks again to CP3461935497.
[122:25.16]Good friend of mine.

[122:27.10]Wait, that's me?
[122:49.32]Okay, well, thanks a lot, me.
[122:52.08]Appreciate it.
[122:53.66]Let's open up Planetside.
[122:55.24]So, I'm going to probably have to do some initial graphics shit, so bear with me here while I get it set.
[123:04.66]I'm going to change the title to Planetside.
[123:10.97]Well, how am I supposed to know?
[123:11.75]There's tons of fucking people there.
[123:15.53]Planetside 2.
[123:22.56]Alright.
[123:23.04]Hopefully a lot of you guys have been able to get it.
[123:27.07]Toontown.
[123:27.67]I'm sorry.
[123:28.19]I know.
[123:28.43]I tried.
[123:29.25]I tried to get Toontown.
[123:30.79]I will try to get that to work.
[123:32.71]We'll do this another night too.
[123:35.15]What the fuck was my name?
[123:40.12]I forget.
[123:42.34]Is that right?
[123:42.70]Is that correct?
[123:43.50]Shit.
[123:43.72]That's not correct.
[123:46.56]I just did this.
[123:53.42]Alright, we're good.
[123:54.12]We're good.
[123:55.59]I gotta just... I'm gonna turn the audio off because holy shit, this might be loud as hell.
[124:02.21]Battle Eye Launcher.
[124:03.29]This is anti-cheat.
[124:05.27]Okay.
[124:06.45]Please take a look at everything that I do on my computer.
[124:11.04]Scrutinize every file and every folder that I have.
[124:17.82]Alright, we're gonna choose a faction, right?
[124:19.50]So make sure I don't pick a faction yet.
[124:26.21]Faction poll, we'll do it.
[124:35.92]You know this is just going to turn into what we just did with the pirate game, right?
[124:41.43]Okay, hold on.
[124:42.45]This is very loud.
[124:43.37]Let me turn the settings down a little bit.
[124:45.73]This is wild here.
[124:48.19]Master volume, get that down.
[124:49.57]Music volume, who cares?
[124:50.67]Dialogue volume, maximum voice channels.
[124:53.82]Okay.
[124:54.80]Let me just do my graphic settings.
[124:57.18]Field of view is as high as it can go at 74 for vertical.
[125:02.15]Is that?
[125:02.83]That seems a little...
[125:05.79]Some reason that feels a little low, but maybe I'm just insane.
[125:09.81]We've got borderless window, right?
[125:11.41]Full screen windowed.
[125:12.23]All right, let me get this on the screen so you can see it.
[125:18.06]Okay, so we're going to do a poll.
[125:28.66]As you see,
[125:32.70]Okay, we got Vanu, New Conglomerate, and Terran Republic.
[125:38.51]Let's get that poll on the screen for you.
[125:40.17]I haven't played this game in a long time.
[125:48.78]It's been years.
[125:51.14]Which side?
[125:53.44]And make sure you pick this side.
[125:56.55]If you do not pick this, we will not be able to play together.
[126:02.60]New conglomerate.
[126:06.15]Terran.
[126:10.69]Alright.
[126:12.05]Choose wisely here.
[126:15.21]What server?
[126:16.69]I don't know.
[126:17.05]I actually do not know that yet.
[126:21.90]I'm assuming I have to pick that after.
[126:23.26]We're just doing the... Well, this is split very evenly.
[126:29.64]the... seems like the biggest decision we've ever had on stream.
[126:34.42]This is like 33-33-33.
[126:34.89]So far it looks like Terran is currently winning, the red team.
[126:47.37]Now Vanu is... Vanu's coming out here.
[126:56.56]Red, red.
[126:57.54]Blue, blue.
[126:58.66]Purple, purple.
[127:07.65]Damn.
[127:09.09]It's still too close to call.
[127:10.31]It is.
[127:16.79]But it's going to be between Vanu and Terran.
[127:20.37]Separated by only about 10 votes, so I can not clause in it.
[127:32.24]Oh boy.
[127:34.53]all right come on if you haven't voted and you want to know if you want to vote go for it it's currently getting that to that point where we've slowed down tremendously with votes
[127:48.87]Read the descriptions.
[127:49.57]Okay, sure.
[127:50.06]Vanu Sovereignty.
[127:51.40]The Vanu are a transhumanist cult of academics, intellectuals, and technology worshippers who believe that human destiny lies in the further development and exploitation of alien technology.
[128:03.26]So, aliens.
[128:05.48]Then you have New Conglomerate, which is different music.
[128:11.33]Rock music.
[128:13.33]A separatist faction determined to remain free of their controlling and domineering republic.
[128:18.87]They feel that any form of control is oppression and that a miserable free man is better than a contended slave.
[128:25.64]Then you got the Terran Republic.
[128:28.26]Conservative, authoritarian, collectivist nation who strive to regain contact with the home world and reunite the warring factions.
[128:40.55]Alright, so you got... I understand.
[128:44.50]So you've got the Democrats, you've got the Republicans, and you've got the Ralph Nader party.
[128:48.74]Alright.
[128:49.96]So... Are we going to be Democrats or Republicans?
[128:55.55]Or are we going to be Ralph Naders?
[129:05.54]And it looks like we're being the Ralph Nader.
[129:12.83]Because I'm about to close the poll here.
[129:15.71]We got 471 to 449.
[129:18.41]Looks like it's slowed down very much so.
[129:20.41]So that is it.
[129:22.51]We are going to be Vanu.
[129:26.87]Poll is closed.
[129:28.49]471 to 450.
[129:29.19]Thank you for voting.
[129:30.83]Vanu Sovereignty.
[129:31.63]Pick it.
[129:33.04]Pick Vanu.
[129:39.57]And we're doing Vanu.
[129:40.33]There it is.
[129:40.85]Next.
[129:42.69]Alright, so we're going to Emerald.
[129:46.65]Actually, you know what?
[129:48.15]European.
[129:48.69]This is a good middle point for European people too.
[129:51.73]We're going to Emerald.
[129:55.53]Character name.
[129:56.11]We're going Sun Larry.
[130:07.52]Uh...
[130:10.52]Let's go with the standard one.
[130:11.88]It's the default first person.
[130:14.76]That's my face.
[130:17.96]So we got it, right?
[130:33.47]Target Walmart.
[130:34.25]I wonder if that... What was my actual name in the game?
[130:46.51]Do I have to hit next again, or is it loading?
[130:50.24]Or is it full?
[130:54.86]The name is already taken!
[130:56.20]What?!
[130:56.44]Okay, Larry the Sun.
[131:08.15]Emerald.
[131:08.77]Vanu.
[131:13.79]Hmm, might be having... Might be, uh...
[131:17.85]Might have a problem here.
[131:18.79]Alright, everybody stop doing it!
[131:43.39]God damn it.
[131:44.39]Did we break the server?
[131:45.47]Fuck.
[131:52.28]No, I don't want to be that guy.
[131:53.40]God damn it.
[131:59.40]Fuck.
[132:04.11]I'm picking a random server and then you're going to have to find me.
[132:07.61]Oh, God.
[132:08.27]What have I done?
[132:11.33]God damn it.
[132:16.82]Can we make a private server?
[132:20.14]The game crashed.
[132:20.86]Oh, God damn it.
[132:24.54]piss off the whole fucking planet side community.
[132:27.04]What am I doing?
[132:28.46]I'm so sorry.
[132:29.08]Let's try this again.
[132:56.33]Pirate server ran again.
[132:59.52]Yeah, but I just can't it.
[133:00.86]All right.
[133:01.22]I need I need to look at Trying to think of how I think maybe I should go to like the master of comedy channel and just say the server then Somewhere an IT guy just choked on his doughnut.
[133:19.71]Oh
[133:22.44]No, no.
[133:24.16]Let me do a little bit of research first.
[133:26.00]Hold on.
[133:29.56]Fuck me.
[133:30.46]How many people are watching right now?
[133:31.68]There's only like 200 people watching the stream, right?
[133:37.49]Oh, fuck.
[133:38.01]There's 4,000 people here.
[133:39.69]Oh, I'm sorry.
[133:48.29]Why did I think this was going to work?
[133:51.34]All right, nobody click on Emerald, don't do it.
[133:54.46]Listen to me, listen to me very closely, okay?
[133:57.40]Just hold on.
[133:59.19]We're gonna do this in waves.
[134:01.01]We're gonna do this in waves.
[134:03.27]Just hold on a second.
[134:06.43]Just, everybody chill, don't click it.
[134:10.07]Nobody move.
[134:14.85]What we're going to do is I'm gonna tell specific people to join.
[134:19.97]I'm gonna personal message in, I'm not, no, no, wait, this is not gonna work.
[134:23.19]Like I have to PM like 2000 people in the chat.
[134:29.51]That's not gonna work.
[134:31.79]What am I talking about?
[134:35.20]Can you guys see the game?
[134:36.68]Yeah, you can.
[134:39.78]Don't, nobody join yet.
[134:42.74]Look, this is, this is having problems.
[134:45.26]Okay.

[135:25.43]Okay, got it.
[135:26.31]Fuck.
[135:42.80]No cutting in line.
[135:46.62]We're still alright.
[135:47.36]It's just logging in.
[135:49.62]How do people stream this game then?
[135:52.10]You just don't say where you are?
[135:55.91]I crashed again.
[136:00.96]They don't.
[136:04.46]Oh, they don't stream this game.
[136:08.91]Has anybody ever streamed this game?
[136:15.71]I'm going to be sneaky here right now, guys.
[136:31.86]It's supposed to have, wait, is somebody messaging me?
[136:36.77]No.
[136:38.25]The next, the next highest PS2 stream has 34 viewers.
[136:43.67]Oh, okay.
[136:44.57]Well, that's all right though.
[136:47.23]Like if I don't want to fuck, I don't want to like encroach on somebody's like community.
[136:50.21]You know what I mean?
[136:50.71]Like I don't want to be that guy that comes in as like the, the, the murder wasp that kills the bee colony, you know?
[137:09.21]And I, you know, let's come on in and swarm and fucking eat all their honey.
[137:12.07]No, I don't want to do that.
[137:13.28]Leave the bees alone.
[137:22.26]You did that in Pirates.
[137:24.12]No, but that was, we just, we're just having free funny MMO day.
[137:28.63]All right, I'm going to try, let's try this again, but just wait.
[137:33.75]The devs are here.
[137:35.11]The devs, can you make it so we can have nobody
[137:39.39]on a random server in China.
[137:41.77]All right, let me try that.
[137:46.37]Wait, wait, wait.
[137:46.85]I'm going to do something else off camera, by the way.
[137:50.01]You're not going to see this.
[137:53.25]Because I'm going to do something you might not understand.
[138:03.32]Honestly, I'm not even mad, because that pirate game, I don't think I've laughed that hard in probably a couple of weeks at least.
[138:10.80]I'm not even mad.
[138:20.49]TF2 is free?
[138:21.47]Yeah, but TF2 can't handle like a thousand people.
[138:27.75]Alright, let, hold on.
[138:31.55]It's just not ready for us.
[138:33.45]Just isn't ready for us.
[138:37.36]RuneScape can?
[138:44.39]I really want to do this, though.
[138:45.47]This would be so much fun.
[138:46.41]Just hold on a second.
[138:52.67]Everybody relax.
[139:03.42]Remove planet side.
[139:04.22]It's too confusing for new players.
[139:15.83]the venue population has increased oh yeah I can't even click on this is fucked well this is super fucked yeah we have only one of two percent
[139:47.47]This was such a fun idea too.
[139:49.67]I'm so salty right now.
[139:51.86]If we didn't have a 500 pirate person car crash, I would be so upset right now.
[140:01.54]Hold on.
[140:06.60]I have an idea.
[140:07.44]This is my last shot in the dark here.
[140:14.83]Must play Roblox.
[140:16.91]No, must play Planetside 2.
[140:25.76]We haven't gotten this far to give up.
[140:27.08]That's true.
[140:27.80]Yeah, I haven't given up, not yet.
[140:33.86]Somebody just said masturbate on stream.
[140:37.18]That's not a free MMO.
[140:38.38]First of all, I'm playing free MMOs today.
[140:41.06]Second of all, that's not something I'm going to do.
[140:43.10]I will lose my Twitch partnership.
[140:45.56]And why would I do that anyways?
[140:47.50]I'm sorry, but you're going to have to find that somewhere else.
[140:52.12]That is free MMO night to night.
[140:54.00]Let's go with... I wish I didn't have to log in every fucking time.
[141:10.28]Am I going to last five minutes playing this game?
[141:17.26]Alright, let me ask you this.
[141:18.66]How many of you guys are in the game right now in Planetside 2?
[141:22.83]On that server?
[141:29.83]Bullshit.
[141:30.49]No.
[141:31.37]I don't believe it for a second.
[141:34.96]I don't believe that.
[141:38.44]Me, me, me, me, me, me.
[142:02.12]Hold on.
[142:03.42]This might work.
[142:07.90]Got it.
[142:08.76]Okay.
[142:09.24]Ladies and gentlemen, if you would please.
[142:18.77]Okay.
[142:19.35]If you would please.
[142:20.21]I'm in the game.
[142:22.31]I am...
[142:31.43]So it's all right to make mistakes and take as much time.
[142:34.12]Use your movement keys to move forward.
[142:36.36]Why is the mouse on the screen?
[142:37.88]And sidestep to the left or to the right.
[142:40.20]This is on the West server, US West.
[142:42.38]Why is the cursor on the screen?
[142:54.04]I can't.
[142:55.82]Okay, Alt.
[142:58.72]I'm in... Okay.
[143:00.66]Don't... Don't flood it.
[143:01.91]Don't flood it.
[143:04.17]Don't flood the server.
[143:05.19]Do not do it.
[143:06.55]We're on the western east... Not the western... God damn it.
[143:10.11]The western US server.
[143:11.77]Don't go there yet.
[143:13.91]If you hear me talking right now, wait two minutes.
[143:16.43]And the person that heard me say that, wait five minutes.
[143:21.46]Don't flood it.
[143:24.38]Holding down the sprint key while moving will make you run...
[143:27.54]We're gonna pick a location, and I want you to slowly... Honestly, this is like me explaining to people with a building on fire.
[143:35.97]Okay, everybody, please just walk very slowly behind me to the... No, everyone's gonna panic and fucking sprint in every direction.
[143:43.81]This is why you need to listen to instructions.
[143:45.85]If you're in a building fire, listen to the guy with the hat on and the name tag.
[143:50.06]Follow his rules.
[143:53.75]Capture and hold these points to take control of the region.
[143:57.11]Center the screen.
[143:57.83]What the fuck is this?
[143:58.45]Successful update must be maintained in order to complete the transfer of control.
[144:03.90]So any enemy resistance must be eliminated to ensure success.
[144:08.88]OK.
[144:14.08]Germ of Fear has asked to be your friend.
[144:16.33]Sure.
[144:17.85]All right.
[144:20.81]How do I?
[144:21.51]This is secured.
[144:22.13]And how do I leave?
[144:23.51]I just have to capture it.
[144:25.07]Okay, I'm starting to remember.
[144:26.17]Resupply.
[144:27.06]God damn it, man.
[144:27.70]All right.
[144:28.04]Next batch of people, please go in.
[144:28.94]Okay.
[144:52.30]Did you hear what I said?
[144:52.86]All right, next group.
[144:55.18]You know when you board an airplane?
[144:56.82]So zone two, would you please board the plane?
[145:02.04]Your weapons are just as dangerous to your teammates.
[145:04.71]Everybody go.
[145:05.65]No, I said zone two.
[145:06.83]It is essential you learn how to identify friend from foe.
[145:11.47]By default, your teammates all have friendly blue triangle indicators above their heads.
[145:16.87]This is going to be fucking insane.
[145:19.32]I'm so glad this works.
[145:22.10]Enemy players do not have any indicators above them unless they are spotted.
[145:26.46]Pressing Y on every invite.
[145:28.06]While you have an enemy in your crosshair to mark them for yourself and for nearby friendly players.
[145:33.25]You got it.
[145:33.65]All right.
[145:35.62]I'm currently outside here.
[145:37.88]Yes, I'll be your friend.
[145:39.64]Access equipment.
[145:40.80]Yeah, I'm going to go back to light assault.
[145:42.24]I thought that was somebody in voice chat.
[145:50.55]All right, so let's take a look at the map.
[145:52.19]Spot key.
[145:52.43]Spotter to Prowler.
[146:03.19]The simplest form of shooting is hipfire, where you shoot without careful aiming.
[146:08.55]The area between the crosshair ticks shows where your shots will land when you fire your weapon.
[146:12.92]Yes, I know how to fire a weapon in a first-person shooter.
[146:17.92]Try shooting some targets using hipfire.
[146:22.18]Shooting some targets with hipfire.
[146:24.46]Sure.
[146:28.85]Kill three target dummies.
[146:29.99]Where the fuck are they?
[146:33.92]Are there target dummies?
[146:38.18]Try shooting some targets using hip fire.
[146:40.97]You can skip?
[146:41.83]How do I skip the tutorial?
[146:48.17]You can also aim down the sights of your weapon by right clicking on your mouse.
[146:53.21]This will greatly improve accuracy but penalize your movement.
[146:57.53]Headshots will do more damage to your target, especially if you are using a high-powered sniper rifle.
[147:02.81]You can't hit it.
[147:03.97]What do you mean, idiot?
[147:05.27]This is the first time I've played this game in like four years.
[147:09.25]Reload before the magazine is empty using the reload key.
[147:15.42]You can switch weapons and items by pressing your weapon slot keys or by scrolling the mouse wheel.
[147:21.12]Use your hand to click the mouse.
[147:22.32]Switching to your pistol is faster than reloading your primary weapon.
[147:28.45]Okay, friends.
[147:29.17]Yes, we got lots of friends.
[147:30.89]The usability key is used by some classes to activate their special class-defining ability, such as the cloaking device for the invulnerable.
[147:40.00]Oh, God.
[147:40.56]I'm just flying around.
[147:41.34]The shield for heavy assault or the group heal for the combat medic.
[147:47.09]Does somebody's name is Jermascrotum?
[147:48.83]Well, that's great.
[147:49.25]Take some time to get comfortable with shooting and familiarize yourself with your weapons and classes.
[147:57.02]okay move to the mission waypoint which is over here
[148:10.28]Let's go over here.
[148:12.34]Alright, do I... Alright, spawn me over there.
[148:13.96]Redeploy timer.
[148:15.98]Yes, please do.
[148:16.48]Get me over there.
[148:17.28]I would love it.
[148:39.80]Alright, so, who's that?
[148:41.36]There's somebody there.
[148:42.18]Training facility.
[148:42.84]Go, go, go.
[148:43.48]Sure thing.
[148:46.82]Infantry aren't your only threats.
[148:49.40]Our outdoor range also has vehicle targets.
[148:53.13]Most vehicles are resistant to small arms fire.
[148:55.87]We're on west.
[148:57.87]Zone 3, you are now able to board the plane.
[149:00.31]For these threats, you have to use rocket launchers and other more powerful ordnance.
[149:07.13]Heavy assault.
[149:07.87]Quickly.
[149:08.15]You got it.
[149:08.57]Rocket launcher.
[149:08.93]Rocket launcher E to... Press E to the phalanx turret by the terminal.
[149:12.28]Sure thing.
[149:34.06]The anti-vehicle phalanx turret offers great defense against ground vehicles with its high explosive rounds.
[149:42.60]It's already broken.
[149:43.54]Alright, exit vehicle.
[149:47.60]Good.
[149:48.20]Anti-tank.
[149:49.48]This thrust pad will move you around the vicinity quickly.
[149:51.50]Use the thrust pad.
[149:52.64]Quickly.
[149:52.96]If you step onto the pad, you will be jettisoned at high velocity in the direction the pad is pointing.
[149:59.23]Oh my god.
[150:00.15]An inertial dampener is in place to allow for a safe landing.
[150:06.49]Speedrunning.
[150:07.61]I'm trying.
[150:09.71]Which one do you want me to get in?
[150:10.85]The flash.
[150:11.19]Get it.
[150:11.43]Change camera.
[150:11.95]T. What objective?
[150:12.79]Move to the ammo terminal.
[150:34.49]Don't die from this.
[150:35.27]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[150:35.89]Yep, yep, I get it.
[150:36.81]Excellent.
[150:37.21]Next bit.
[150:38.03]Look at the squad.
[150:38.59]We have so many people that are just... That's fine.
[151:04.66]This type of generator maintains power to the perimeter shields, preventing brown vehicles from entering the facility.
[151:12.08]All right, come on!
[151:15.12]Overload the generator.
[151:18.88]Hold E. Larry the Sub, that's my name.
[151:26.85]Can it explode?
[151:35.20]No, I have to defend this.
[151:36.74]Yes, I know.
[151:38.17]I just did it.
[151:39.03]Explode.
[151:39.51]I did it.
[151:39.93]Good work.
[151:40.15]Play Halo Online?
[151:40.59]What is Halo Online?
[152:01.49]Warp.
[152:02.19]This is where we're going.
[152:03.72]We're going to Esamir.
[152:05.30]We're in.
[152:22.56]Oh god.
[152:23.87]Oh, there's people talking.
[152:27.41]I need you to... I need you to... I need you to go into your social and make your squad...
[152:42.05]This guy's trying to manage these people.
[152:44.77]Do you think you're going to manage this?
[152:46.67]Oh, I don't.
[152:47.41]Remember I told you.
[152:48.37]Listen to me.
[152:49.07]Everybody listen.
[152:50.51]Seriously.
[152:51.73]This is the guy with the name tag.
[152:53.20]I swear to God.
[152:54.00]This is the guy with the name tag.
[152:56.76]Listen to him.
[152:57.26]Follow his orders.
[152:59.08]This is the guy with the name tag.
[153:06.92]Get to the roof.
[153:07.48]Everybody listen to him.
[153:08.24]Listen to him.
[153:08.80]He's the guy with the name tag in the fire building.
[153:10.35]Come on.
[153:17.56]I need you to get to the roof.
[153:19.64]On the roof.
[153:20.36]How do I say hello?
[153:20.94]How do I talk?
[153:22.09]Get up here.
[153:25.03]Social.
[153:25.35]Where is it?
[153:27.67]Hey gamers.
[153:28.87]Okay.
[153:29.11]Voice chat.
[153:29.73]How do I talk?
[153:31.17]Voice chat.
[153:31.65]How do I do this?
[153:33.88]Select other channels.
[153:36.58]Test my microphone.
[153:37.44]Does my microphone work?
[153:39.08]Hello?

[153:41.94]Shit.
[153:46.04]Use the code word.
[153:47.30]For his voice chat.
[153:51.32]Someone in Alpha, pull a galaxy.
[153:53.66]I need you to pull a galaxy.
[153:54.78]Hello?
[153:55.12]Hello?
[153:55.54]Can you hear me?
[153:57.28]Hello?
[153:58.78]Can anybody hear me?
[154:01.14]Alright, listen.
[154:02.17]Let's do it.
[154:02.97]What happened?
[154:16.01]Why is it so silent? Why is it so silent?
[154:18.19]What happened to the audio in the game?
[154:22.00]It's- there's too many people, Jerma.
[154:24.29]No, I don't- fuck off.
[154:25.73]I think we need batteries.
[154:26.97]Okay, we need a galaxy over here.
[154:30.87]Jump over the thing and get in the galaxy. The giant thing.
[154:32.87]AH! Goddammit you didn't tell me there were Dark Souls holes in the ground.
[154:40.10]Sorry. Oh god uhm-
[154:44.10]Alright, short streamer, we need you to kick everyone out that's not in the squad.
[154:48.30]It's not my name.
[154:49.22]So hit page door.
[154:51.08]Page door?
[154:51.74]Here you go.
[154:52.26]Hit page door?
[154:53.50]Put it on the ground.
[154:57.17]Short streamer, I need you to put it on the ground.
[154:59.69]I'm not even, I'm not here.
[155:02.15]That's not me.
[155:02.93]I know, I know.
[155:04.03]We're trying to get, I know.
[155:05.09]I'm speaking to the pilot of the galaxy.
[155:07.61]Oh, I thought you were being a dick and talking to me.
[155:09.35]Everyone in the other squad.
[155:15.24]I thought he was being a dick.
[155:16.12]Alright, getting something to fly.
[155:17.26]Alright, I'm coming.
[155:18.76]I'm coming.
[155:19.04]I'm in.
[155:19.24]There's 5,000 people in one plane.
[155:46.23]So are we about to overrun the first place we go to without even a contest?
[155:53.17]Who's shooting me?
[155:53.77]Yes.
[155:56.23]All right.
[155:58.08]Everyone in my platoon, go, go, go, go towards all the arrows that should be on your map.
[156:02.92]Can I change the camera?
[156:03.60]They are currently northeast.
[156:04.82]We're going to fucking crash those guys.
[156:06.62]All right, let's do it.
[156:08.66]All right, German.
[156:09.32]Are you ready for this shitstorm?
[156:10.80]This is going to be great.
[156:11.92]I'm looking forward to it.
[156:13.38]There's 6,000 people here right now inside of this plane.
[156:15.72]Hopefully.
[156:17.19]Yeah, inside of this plane, we have 6,000 fucking people.
[156:19.94]It's crowded as hell.
[156:21.16]I think someone just puked.
[156:23.70]Yeah.
[156:26.32]By the way, tell people where we're going as well.
[156:28.30]We're heading towards Isotec plant.
[156:29.88]Because there's no way I can get everyone inside.
[156:32.20]They can hear everything you're saying.
[156:40.19]Are we going down?
[156:40.67]Are we crashing?
[156:44.53]Are we crashing?
[156:49.74]Hopefully the plane's not crashing here.
[156:53.24]There's like 3,000 people on this plane.
[156:54.50]We can't crash.
[156:55.40]I might have fucked up a bit here, but it's okay.
[157:04.17]We're still heading towards Isotek Planet.
[157:05.91]Just tell everyone in the stream that's currently in game.
[157:08.23]What are we even doing?
[157:11.11]Everyone, go straight towards the tech plant.
[157:12.89]I don't care where you go.
[157:14.19]Just go somewhere there.
[157:15.61]Drop everyone off.
[157:16.47]Everyone, when we get over
[157:19.31]We're gonna be like fucked.
[157:20.85]We're all gonna die.
[157:22.29]They're not gonna be prepared for this.
[157:24.04]Alright, let's get in.
[157:25.58]This is so unfair.
[157:26.36]How unfair is this?
[157:48.97]Watch out for tank bombs.
[157:52.01]Watch out for any sort of... Alright, what if we explode?
[157:55.79]We have to go towards EA.
[157:58.35]Alright, EA.
[158:00.80]EA.
[158:01.28]It's all in the game.
[158:03.60]If you see anyone that's blue, fucking shoot them in their stupid face.
[158:06.46]Got it.
[158:06.74]What about the invisible guys?
[158:09.28]Shoot them too.
[158:13.89]Alright, what I need everyone to do, I need everyone to hit F, or V, and then 4.
[158:18.17]V.
[158:19.33]4.
[158:20.65]Ow!
[158:22.69]We need more batteries.
[158:24.39]It's important.
[158:25.53]How do we get batteries?
[158:26.23]Alright, Jerm is gonna die.
[158:27.25]We need someone to heal him up.
[158:29.19]Keep me alive!
[158:29.87]If we have any medics, we need Jerm alive.
[158:32.51]I'm responding.
[158:33.23]Keep Jerm alive.
[158:37.11]Oh my god, he's freaking so wiped out.
[158:39.85]Everybody's dying.
[158:44.33]Oh god, I'm dead.
[158:46.61]Medics, we need medics.
[158:48.01]This is just a giant escort mission.
[158:50.67]I'm coming!
[158:53.19]Place a bounty on that fucking guy.
[158:57.68]I got my first... Alright, I'm understanding.
[158:59.70]Let's deploy... Let's deploy right here.
[159:02.92]Medics on the way!
[159:03.72]Alright, where are we?
[159:06.86]Alright, uh... This isn't gonna work.
[159:08.96]Just redeploy at the sundry.
[159:11.13]We truly allow yourself to move.
[159:14.58]Alright, Germa.
[159:15.06]I need you to tell me specifically what you want to do.
[159:17.48]Alright, I would like to... Where can we all just fit in the same building?
[159:22.44]You're so loud!
[159:23.42]Am I loud?
[159:25.84]We can all fit in this one building.
[159:27.31]Alright, everybody get in this building.
[159:31.05]Everyone.
[159:31.61]But don't go anywhere.
[159:33.01]We need to go right in front of the Ogremar front door.
[159:36.71]We can't go through that door.
[159:37.63]I just realized.
[159:38.19]Everyone turn left.
[159:39.75]Right here.
[159:41.23]This little cubby here.
[159:43.39]Literally a thousand people standing right here.
[159:44.95]Why is it so loud?
[159:49.31]Easy, easy, easy, easy.
[159:51.02]Watch out for this tank though.
[159:51.86]Is that our tank?
[159:52.54]I'm so scared.
[159:54.36]So many dead.
[160:07.44]We just racked that guy up like ten ranks by the way.
[160:10.14]He just killed like 45 people in one drive That guy got more kills than he's ever had in the game I can't even tell who's on my team
[160:32.77]Alright, what if we... Hold on a minute.
[160:34.59]What about this red base over here?
[160:35.93]They look like they're very not defended.
[160:39.21]Ice a mountain?
[160:39.79]Sure, we can run over there.
[160:41.23]Alright, let's get in a vehicle or just walk.
[160:43.91]Is people lying?
[160:44.49]This guy, is he dead?
[160:47.50]Probably.
[160:50.84]Alright, I mean, the red base currently has like the Harry Potter spell blocking Hogwarts.
[160:54.72]Like, whatever it is.
[160:55.80]How do we... I'm dead again.
[160:56.94]How?
[160:59.52]Welcome to Plan Sight 2.
[161:02.89]That's all I can say.
[161:05.07]How do we get a bunch of little planes?
[161:07.59]We're going to blow up this fucking tank.
[161:11.72]How do we get a bunch of tiny planes?
[161:14.06]We're going to go back to the warp gate.
[161:16.08]Back to the warp gate.
[161:18.10]Can every single person get in a tiny plane?
[161:22.32]Yes, everyone can get in a tiny plane.
[161:24.38]Okay, good.
[161:24.86]Everyone, we are redeploying to the warp gate.
[161:27.28]Redeploy to the warp gate.
[161:29.69]Rambo out.
[161:30.25]I don't give a shit.
[161:30.89]Just get dead and get back to the warp gate.
[161:32.99]Stop reviving me, please.
[161:34.65]Back to the warp gate.
[161:35.59]Get in the smallest plane possible.
[161:37.03]One person per plane.
[161:39.81]Yes.
[161:41.41]What we are going to be doing, we are going to be swarming the shit out of them with scythes.
[161:45.35]Scythe is the name of the small plane.
[161:47.58]If you are in anything else, you're doing it wrong and you're probably poor.
[161:53.00]So where's the vehicle terminal?
[161:55.78]Uh, you wanna go to the vehicle terminal that looks like a plane.
[161:58.54]Oh, I'm in the right place.
[161:59.84]Uh, if you're going to one that looks like a tank, then you're an idiot.
[162:02.96]I'm sorry.
[162:03.86]Hey, you guys, uh, you guys play that, uh, movie?
[162:07.16]It's called 21 Jumps.
[162:08.22]It's really great.

[163:20.61]Oh, fuck.
[163:42.58]Okay, wait till every single person is in.
[163:44.38]Whoa!
[163:45.16]Alright, try not to flip yourself, because if you flip yourself, you're probably not going to get in.
[163:50.42]Oh, I saved it.
[163:51.50]Alright, good.
[163:54.08]You can hit T to go into third person mode, just FYI.
[163:56.34]Please don't crash into anything.
[164:00.46]No, somebody... You can shift to go fast.
[164:13.65]Please don't crash into me.
[164:15.11]I crashed it.
[164:15.97]Look, there's like a bunch of people around it.
[164:17.75]So loud.
[164:19.19]All right, everyone, I need you to hit V5.
[164:25.53]Son of a bitch.
[164:27.69]All right, hold on.
[164:28.33]I'm coming back.
[164:29.47]None of you hit V5.
[164:31.61]I got shot out of the sky by a tank.
[164:35.69]Oh, that's really sad.
[164:38.77]We're not leaving the warp gate just yet.
[164:40.67]We're waiting until everyone is in the site.
[164:43.83]Have you guys seen, uh, Channing Tatum?
[164:47.01]Hello?
[164:47.41]What's this guy, what's this guy doing with Channing fucking Tatum?

[165:29.11]No, no, I don't know where I'm going!
[165:40.46]Well, all it takes is one guy.
[165:43.96]Keep that in mind.
[165:46.61]All right.
[165:52.15]Just unmute him.
[165:52.93]I have no idea who the fuck it even was.
[165:55.15]There's like a thousand people here.
[166:01.68]All right.
[166:02.74]I think... Wait, I want to do third person.
[166:04.72]Here we go.
[166:07.84]Everybody get in a tank.
[166:08.70]No, no, no.
[166:09.08]I'm going to die here.
[166:09.84]Hold on.
[166:19.01]How do you drive this?
[166:20.33]Oh my god, this is hard.
[166:22.19]It's just a mouse.
[166:24.69]They're probably looking over here and being like, what the fuck?
[166:30.09]I don't know how to drive.
[166:31.76]No, no.
[166:33.02]Turn around.
[166:34.24]Turn the car around.
[166:38.44]There we go.
[166:38.88]I have to be in... Shit.
[166:40.68]I'm good.
[166:41.30]I made...
[166:59.06]All right, let me go back to my voice chat here.
[167:06.35]Where can I make it so it's only like a certain person?
[167:13.95]Interface.
[167:15.29]How the fuck do I do this?
[167:19.29]Master receive, enable voice.
[167:21.42]How do I do this?
[167:32.42]I don't see it.
[167:36.23]Add the guy?
[167:36.85]All right, here's what we're going to do.
[167:43.21]No, I can't do that.
[167:46.95]Use Discord and OK.
[167:48.31]All right, that's what we're going to do.
[167:54.66]Do you have spare batteries?
[168:02.83]Hold on.
[168:04.21]One sec.
[168:06.86]Mute proximity?
[168:11.34]I can't take that risk not knowing 100%.
[168:13.32]Honest to God, I can't.
[168:18.26]I can't have that shit be blasted through speakers, man.
[168:20.76]Like, not even 1% chance for that to happen.
[168:23.49]Alright, um... Alright, well...
[168:30.79]I wonder if I can.
[168:31.69]Is he in the Discord right now?
[168:37.45]The Discord's being swamped.
[168:41.89]What the fuck is going on on my screen?
[168:49.51]All right, let's try the Discord and see how the Discord's doing.
[168:53.59]Oh, God.
[168:54.57]Can you hear me?
[168:58.15]Hello?
[169:01.02]Okay.
[169:02.82]Well, that didn't work out so well.
[169:05.44]That didn't work out so well.
[169:08.30]This is working out great.
[169:09.74]Oh, God.
[169:20.71]So it turns out nobody can be trusted.
[169:23.57]So here's what we're going to do.
[169:25.85]We're going to go ahead and just play Planetside.
[169:29.70]How much fun.
[169:32.94]I'm ready to go into a tank or a car or a plane or a boat.
[169:38.38]Any boat will do.
[169:40.18]Flying a boat around.
[169:41.16]Let's go attack the enemy base with our boats.
[169:44.42]That sounds like fun.
[169:53.48]One last attempt.
[169:56.58]I'm getting a... Okay, we're going with galaxy.

[170:03.15]Am I in it?
[170:05.89]Okay, how do I land the galaxy?
[170:07.11]I shouldn't have done this.
[170:07.73]I need to slowly land this.
[170:11.53]Is it space?
[170:12.33]How do I go down?
[170:12.93]It's control?
[170:15.03]It's control.
[170:15.49]There's nobody around me, right?
[170:19.00]Let me tilt it up.
[170:21.16]Guys, guys, you're in the way.
[170:23.74]Everybody has to get in the galaxy.
[170:27.04]How many people can fit- as many people that can fit in the ga- This is not ideal.

[171:37.38]Oh, I have an instant fucking headache right now.
[171:39.16]I swear to God, my head is killing me.
[171:41.66]I don't know where I'm going.
[171:46.48]We're going this way.
[171:50.13]What happened?
[171:51.97]Stop it!
[171:52.56]Leave me alone!
[171:54.88]You've been firing on ally forces!
[172:03.22]We can't even leave the base!

[172:46.63]You guys are all monsters.
[172:54.13]If you don't stop fighting, my weapons will be locked.
[172:57.13]It's not me doing it.
[172:57.99]It's somebody else.
[173:00.08]Why am I getting points?
[173:02.74]Bad guy points for doing... I can't even speak.
[173:05.39]There's no talking right now.
[173:13.55]Where did you... There it goes.
[173:33.10]Why are you shooting me?
[173:34.14]Stop fucking shooting me!
[173:36.27]This is a war on our own team!
[173:45.31]I just placed a bounty on my own teammate.
[173:48.27]Is that really what's going on right now?
[173:52.54]What in the name of God?
[173:53.70]Alright, I'm gonna go into Jerma is a good boy's car.
[174:02.30]Alright, I'm inside of his gunner.
[174:09.88]They're all just fighting each other.
[174:17.31]Like, we have to deal with the people that are shooting us on our own team and the bad guys.
[174:27.97]Don't crash, don't crash.
[174:30.86]We're gonna have to jump out here.
[174:34.26]Wait, no, no, no, not yet, not yet.
[174:35.50]Oh, God.
[174:36.70]I'm gonna get sick.
[174:39.67]Is that a bad guy?
[174:42.41]It is.
[174:52.07]I can't handle this, man.
[174:57.45]This is, like, next level.
[175:02.52]I just wanted to play MMOs with my friends.
[175:04.56]Alright, this is an experiment for sure.
[175:14.61]I'm glad we did this.
[175:16.65]Now let me get a kill.
[175:17.15]I'm going to get like two or three kills here.
[175:24.75]It's got to be worth it.
[175:26.06]Two kills.
[175:26.60]Three kills.
[175:28.48]Get some headshots.
[175:29.42]Make it happen.
[175:35.74]Am I the only one here?
[175:37.16]Can I walk in this?
[175:39.61]No.
[175:41.51]Are they just going to see me walking around their base?
[175:57.04]Bring it on.
[175:57.34]Come on.
[176:04.50]He's dead.
[176:06.56]Come on, gotta get one more.
[176:07.30]One more guy, come on!
[176:15.37]Squad, spawn on me if you get a chance.
[176:18.29]Oh, they can't hear me.
[176:26.79]Volume's too low?
[176:28.03]Oh, it's because I panicked and ripped it to zero.
[176:29.94]Hold on.
[176:34.32]Anybody up here?
[176:34.76]Can I destroy this stuff?
[176:37.03]Oh, I can.
[176:37.69]Okay.
[176:39.58]What?
[176:41.70]Oh, a tank shot through the window.
[176:46.08]Alright, one last life, and I think I'm going to have to call this a night here.
[176:56.08]Jack's down.
[177:00.01]Come on, come on, spawn!
[177:03.35]Is anybody in that plane?
[177:04.15]What's going on here?
[177:14.06]I pressed E. It didn't do anything.
[177:16.48]Alright, I want to roll in there with... Let's do heavy assault.
[177:19.74]Last chance here.
[177:21.22]That guy should be... Friendly fire.
[177:23.06]Ban him.
[177:23.56]Ban that guy from the server.
[177:24.72]That guy... I don't know who did it, but find out who it was and take their equipment.
[177:31.41]I mean, honestly, might as well just fight each other.
[177:35.49]Alright, I can jump.
[177:40.87]Alright, we're good.
[177:46.13]So let me go... Somebody said, Jerma, please.
[177:48.89]Jerma, please, what?
[177:50.61]What do you need?
[177:52.27]Alright, I'll follow you.
[177:53.31]I'm following you for the rest of the stream.
[177:56.85]Let's go.
[178:02.19]Now... My head... Watch this guy turn the corner and like three of his friends are in a tank and I die.
[178:12.80]Just get fired on.
[178:20.65]I'm going to die before I get over here.
[178:25.36]We're playing hide and go seek, man.
[178:28.62]What are we looking for here?
[178:29.38]Alright, I'm going to get in a... I'm going to get on one of these things.
[178:39.22]Get me on a flash.
[178:43.39]Old school RuneScape doesn't have friendly fire.
[178:46.25]We'll do this again.
[178:47.45]Look, this was actually pretty fun.
[178:52.79]God, this is... I'm just gonna... Can I just get out there?
[178:58.77]This person's just driving into the fucking wall.
[179:06.00]This guy right here is just shooting people that walk out the door.
[179:10.52]He's just killing everybody that walks out here.
[179:18.08]I've got the... Yes, please revive me.
[179:23.82]People's dropping grenades and... Get me out of here.
[179:30.88]Get me on the bike.
[179:31.66]I'm just gonna go.
[179:32.26]I'm going on my own.
[179:35.17]Come on.
[179:35.91]Get me to... Get me inside of a... Oh, well.
[179:49.50]Did it not say the Q?
[179:50.87]Yeah, but does that mean I'm going to get a chance?
[179:52.95]If I keep dying... Bounty on my own guy.
[180:03.33]I'm just going to get in this thing.
[180:07.47]Right here.
[180:07.88]Whatever it is.
[180:10.06]Come on.
[180:13.82]Not infiltrator not this thing.
[180:15.48]I don't All right.
[180:18.02]I think I'm gonna leave.
[180:19.46]I think that's it I know that's what a Q means, but look at okay.
[180:23.84]Q me up for a flash all right Now don't get killed in the process They don't even know I'm over here.
[180:37.93]They're all too busy killing each other at the thing
[180:42.90]Alright, good, I'm in.
[180:44.98]Alright, let's go.
[180:49.36]I'm ready.
[180:51.61]Get me... Alright, good, good.
[180:52.91]Yeah, we can have a guy.
[180:56.39]I got a guy on the back.
[180:58.19]Let's just go explore.
[181:00.93]Let's go this way.
[181:01.71]We gotta get away from all the madness.
[181:04.84]How did I say that?
[181:07.48]How did I say that?
[181:09.74]We're just playing Manhunt right now.
[181:13.61]It's not even about the video game.
[181:15.27]It's about... Look at this.
[181:18.41]This is Escape the People.
[181:22.51]My battle rank is up.
[181:24.01]Somehow.
[181:29.80]Oh, shit.
[181:33.22]Didn't I have a guy on my bike?
[181:39.06]Alright, going up this way.
[181:49.09]C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
[181:49.83]DAMMIT!
[181:50.49]UGH!
[181:50.59]I was trying to drive into that guy.
[181:53.86]Alright, that's it.
[181:56.76]That's it.
[182:00.32]Log it out.
[182:03.51]That was, uh... That was intense.
[182:09.33]Thank you everybody for making that possible.
[182:11.17]GG 100 points?
[182:15.56]It don't matter.
[182:21.99]oh making that in quotes possible it's I still had fun that was still that was worth it all those games except for I mean I was gonna say diddy kong's quest but it's club penguin oh
[182:48.62]Yeah, the other ones, there's like two.
[182:50.46]I want to try to get Toontown to work eventually.
[182:55.10]But that is going to wrap it up for tonight.
[182:59.03]Because I want to get the other games ready.
[183:01.01]I don't really want to just sit here and troubleshoot Toontown because I tried for like an hour.
[183:04.29]It didn't work.
[183:08.59]Yeah, I've got some stuff to do tomorrow.
[183:13.39]I mentioned this before, but...
[183:16.49]It's gonna start to get a little hectic here.
[183:18.73]Sorry the streams have been, like, less than four or five hours the last, uh, like, three streams or so.
[183:24.80]It's because there's a lot of work that needs to be done to my place.
[183:29.46]A lot of shit has to happen here.
[183:32.49]And there's people coming tomorrow, there's people coming on Wednesday, and...
[183:37.01]So I need to be around and prepare for certain things because I'm obviously moving across the country.
[183:42.63]That was hysterical.
[183:44.27]Obviously, I haven't laughed that hard in probably at least a month.
[183:49.34]So thank you for having fun too.
[183:53.76]Let's do the credits.
[183:55.82]Next stream will be obviously on Tuesday.
[183:58.52]Probably going to go back to Dark Souls Remastered.
[184:01.64]We've been away from it for a long enough time.
[184:04.10]where it should be fun.
[184:06.26]I've got another probably 40%, 30% of the game left.
[184:11.56]So we'll go back to that and try to finish it.
[184:14.52]And then after that, there is something that I've been working on here that you might see that's not a typical kind of stream.
[184:23.91]If it works, it's going to be a ton of fun.
[184:26.77]It involves every single one of you.
[184:29.09]So maybe in like a week or two, we'll see by next week.
[184:34.42]But if you've taken off, see you again soon.
[184:38.08]Take care.
[184:40.12]Well, let's do the credits.
[184:40.82]Let's move out of here, this thing.
[184:47.26]And pull up the credits.
[184:49.85]Thank you, everybody that subbed and resubbed tonight.
[184:56.43]I should probably get out of here.
[185:00.96]Thank you once again, as always.

[187:15.22]Thanks a lot.
[187:41.57]Again, we'll see you on Tuesday for Dark Souls Remastered.
[187:46.89]Let me exit this first.
[187:48.09]Let's do the bits.
[187:53.25]Oh, my computer is like crashing right now for some reason.
[187:57.74]Or at least Planetside is.
[187:58.68]Okay, there we go.
[188:00.72]All right, let's get to the bits.
[188:04.30]Why don't we here?
[188:07.76]Go back to earlier.
[188:11.10]and here we go thank you garfield the monday killer for the one dollar we got our daily garfield strip obviously let's put this into the chat here here's your garfield monday killer let's see welcome everyone to another german rumble we've got a lot of festivities underway now before the match begins let me talk about how awful 2k18 is
[188:34.39]Alright, here comes Glue Man.
[188:35.28]He delivers a spinning slobber knocker into the Biaz face.
[188:37.66]Uh-oh, are my frames dropping?
[188:40.22]Curse you, Comcast.
[188:41.02]Sorry, guys.
[188:41.56]Streams cancelled.
[188:43.22]Guess I owe already $30.
[188:47.61]Where are you getting these Garfield templates?
[188:52.79]You seem to have a lot of them.
[188:54.09]Or do you just like go in and do that yourself in Photoshop?
[189:00.46]That seems pretty accurate, though.
[189:03.77]germa germa 985 me uh you got it pretty accurate plays game uh hates certain game company talk shit about game company forever tarnishing any uh opportunities with game company forever uh middle of stream frames drop the curse another company and hate more companies severing any potential comcast sponsorship you know it's too that's really is too bad
[189:38.86]All these fucking companies.
[189:42.02]No, it's pretty accurate.
[189:42.86]But thank you, Garfield.
[189:43.60]And your message is, oh boy, another high quality, top notch butterscotch stream you did here, Germarino.
[189:51.09]Even if this was sent before the stream started, but Garf can tell.
[189:54.73]Garf can tell.
[189:55.35]So Germarino, a Garfy milestone is upon us once again.
[189:58.23]What could it be, you may ask?
[190:00.99]It'll be when you get your 50th Garf buck.
[190:03.99]That's right.
[190:04.43]50 whole dollars made of 25 cents worth of Garf tokens.
[190:08.96]Thank you.
[190:10.28]We'll see what it is.
[190:12.10]Where is Destroy All Humans 2?
[190:13.00]That's probably what we'll do this next weekend.
[190:18.30]Depending on how far I can get in Dark Souls Remastered.
[190:21.40]It'll be Tuesday and then into Friday.
[190:25.32]So obviously this Tuesday, nothing on Wednesday or Thursday.
[190:28.59]And then Friday, Saturday, we'll see where we are on Friday with Dark Souls.
[190:33.07]I would say probably by Saturday we will see if we'll play Destroy All Humans 2.
[190:39.94]But thank you, Broluck, for the $1.
[190:41.08]Wow, he really cares about this game.
[190:42.58]You can tell by how excited he was that it was a card game.
[190:46.43]Talking about Wizard 101.
[190:49.27]That one surprised me.
[190:50.09]It really did.
[190:50.49]Wizard 101 actually seems like it could be a fun game.
[190:55.85]Maybe not really, but 10 years ago, 15 years ago, I would probably be playing that game.
[191:06.67]Thanks a lot, Broluck.
[191:08.65]Artificer, thanks for the $1.
[191:09.99]Cast Zap.
[191:11.45]Talking about the wizard.
[191:14.33]Thank you, Brolic, again for the $1.
[191:15.47]Or you should play Harry Potter PS1 on the PlayStation 1.
[191:20.83]I looked into it.
[191:24.44]Oh, you didn't even hear that.
[191:25.28]I got caught off by the Tim Allen sound.
[191:28.96]I've actually looked into the Harry Potter games and... Maybe.
[191:33.02]I don't know.
[191:33.64]They seem like they're just...
[191:36.33]It's funny to play the Harry Potter games because they're the Harry Potter games, and that's it.
[191:41.48]So... Probably not.
[191:45.14]SinbadEXE, thanks for the $5.
[191:49.58]You should play Digimon World if you enjoyed Monster Rancher.
[191:52.94]Or for MMOs, play Digimon Masters Online.
[191:57.35]Yeah, I mean, I'm still looking.
[191:58.65]Again, if you have any more, any recommendations, I check that recommended channel all the time.
[192:03.59]So...
[192:05.20]Put it there in the Discord.
[192:09.16]Exclamation point Discord, if you don't know.
[192:12.86]But thanks, man.
[192:13.36]Thank you for the $5 in bed.
[192:15.31]I will definitely check it out.
[192:17.27]Smelly Boy, thanks for the $1.
[192:18.75]You only like this because there are old people with funny voices.
[192:23.21]Right, but I feel like that's a very important quality in a video game, is old people with voices, right?
[192:32.59]Cookie, CRM, give the $50 earlier.
[192:34.38]We already touched upon it, but thank you so much for that, Cookie.
[192:39.70]It means a lot.
[192:43.42]Thank you for that extremely large donation.
[192:45.62]Thank you.
[192:47.18]Garfield the Monday Killer again.
[192:48.92]Garfield's back with another comic.
[192:54.48]You would love Garfield.
[192:57.60]Garfield in Fat and Furry.
[193:06.37]uh here it is germa your 50th garf buck he said it again
[193:20.82]No, it's all right.
[193:22.22]It's good.
[193:22.66]Thank you, Garfield.
[193:24.36]Truly a milestone in the Germa community.
[193:27.36]Maybe not a milestone, but rather a crusty yardstick.
[193:30.49]But a good start for the Garfinator.
[193:32.21]I can't thank you enough for being the greatest online personality on the web.
[193:36.07]Garf's a picky cat, but I haven't seen a single bad piece of content from you.
[193:41.27]That's debatable, but thank you.
[193:43.13]From all of us here at the Arbuckle residence, thank you.
[193:47.22]Germa, is Garfield furry?
[193:49.90]Yes, he is.
[193:51.54]He stands up on two legs and he talks.
[193:54.28]That's a furry.
[194:03.32]That's not quite the criteria as I think about that last sentence a few times.
[194:09.83]That's literally every single person.
[194:12.63]So, take that what you will.
[194:15.17]Thank you, Garfield, though.
[194:16.19]Appreciate it.
[194:17.35]You've been around for a long time.
[194:20.65]Thank you GhoulChamp for the $5.
[194:22.21]Can you just play this game from now on?
[194:25.09]Referring to Wizard101.
[194:27.78]Probably not, but I can see where people would like it.
[194:30.56]Thank you though Ghoul.
[194:32.64]Thank you Doomed for the $1.
[194:34.32]Doomed RS.
[194:35.36]Play old school RuneScape.
[194:36.73]It's easily accessible and can handle a very large gathering of players.
[194:43.40]Save that for the next one.
[194:44.38]We'll do another one of these MMO, free MMO, where we jump onto a server.
[194:49.40]And just kind of dick around.
[194:51.69]You have seen, though, how this... It can be sort of hectic.
[194:56.41]Especially when there is voice chat.
[194:58.45]Just gotta be careful.
[195:00.91]In, like, the smoke of it all.
[195:03.25]It was like, oh, this is so much fun!
[195:04.95]Everyone... Oh, wait a minute.
[195:07.21]It is open voice chat.
[195:09.67]So we just have to be careful.
[195:11.35]Because...
[195:12.54]No, people are crazy.
[195:14.10]That's it.
[195:18.47]Are we going back to Planetside 2, or can you delete it?
[195:22.51]I don't think we'll be playing Planetside 2 again.
[195:29.64]That was a fun little 45 minutes.
[195:34.88]Feels bad.
[195:37.66]Delete that game.
[195:39.42]You don't have to delete it, but...
[195:44.76]Am I a little monster and a man robot?
[195:46.68]You mean like Men in Black?
[195:49.12]No, but maybe.
[195:52.59]But thank you.
[195:54.51]Thank you to Shrewberry for the $2.
[195:57.61]It was my birthday last Tuesday, so I'm here to give you some big boy bits.
[196:00.99]Thanks for being cool.
[196:03.35]Well, Shrewberry, thanks for the $2 of your birthday money.
[196:08.70]Thank you.
[196:10.48]Doomed.
[196:10.94]Thank you, DoomedRS again for the $1.
[196:14.27]RuneScape can hold 2,000 people per world.
[196:17.31]That's pretty insane.
[196:19.92]Definitely something to look into.
[196:23.02]LordAravic, thanks for the $1.
[196:25.80]I normally wouldn't say this about these types of games, but Toontown is a legit and actually fun game, despite the fact that it was intended for kids.
[196:32.89]I'm going to try to get Toontown rewritten to work.
[196:37.41]About, I don't know, an hour or two before the stream, I tried everything that was immediately accessible to play it.
[196:45.70]Everything else was installed perfectly fine, so.
[196:48.68]I don't know why Toontown did not work.
[196:50.28]I can't even get the launcher to open.
[196:51.67]The launcher opens and it goes, fatal error.
[196:55.75]And it's something weird with like a certificate problem.
[196:58.61]And everything I look up about it, people had this problem before, but it's such an old, not really, the community, there's only like five threads about this.
[197:11.78]And none of them really have a good answer.
[197:15.06]But I'll try to get it to work again for next time.
[197:18.58]It does seem like a lot of just fun to play.
[197:23.86]But thanks, Ben.
[197:25.46]Thank you, Brandon.
[197:26.40]Thank you, Brandon201 for the $1.
[197:29.39]Hey, German, since you said you didn't know who Death Grips was in my last donation, I highly recommend you listen to their album, The Money Store.
[197:37.51]It's an amazing album.
[197:40.50]The Money Store.
[197:41.18]I will take a look.
[197:44.28]I will educate myself on who they are.
[197:48.46]I have no idea.
[197:50.24]But maybe.
[197:54.25]On stream.
[197:54.87]No, I'm not going to listen to it on stream.
[197:58.37]Thank you, Tiggle, for the $1.
[198:02.08]Thank you, Stix, for the $1.

[198:10.82]Can a mod ban Jerma's son, please?
[198:16.27]Wait, what?
[198:17.05]Where are you?

[198:34.27]But thank you, Debunk, for your 50 bucks.
[198:40.96]Should have started back when people weren't finished downloading.
[198:45.02]Would have staggered the logins.
[198:48.43]That's true.
[198:51.41]Didn't think about that, but 2020 hindsight, I didn't know it was going to be hard for that to happen.
[198:58.94]But at least we still got to work.
[199:00.30]It was still fun.
[199:01.12]You work in a restaurant.
[199:01.90]Okay, I see.
[199:04.07]Are we doing more free MMOs next stream?
[199:05.75]No, we're going to hold on to the next batch after Destroy All Humans 2.
[199:11.26]So what you can expect, you can expect Dark Souls Remastered, Destroy All Humans 2, maybe a special stream, and then we'll jump back into another few of these free MMOs.
[199:24.06]But thank you so much, DebunkWeFunk.
[199:25.69]Hopefully you see this.

[202:09.68]Jermabot said, hey, Jerma, you probably won't see this, but you've helped me through some tough times in my life, so just thanks for everything.
[202:19.14]No problem at all.
[202:21.77]Like I've said this about a million times, pleasure is all on this side of the table.
[202:26.71]Thank you.

[202:31.76]And thank you also to Son of Jenova, for real.
[202:35.12]Thank you VMuser for the $1.

[202:40.97]To be expected.
[202:43.19]Investigate311, thanks for the $1.

[202:56.00]We'll do that next time.
[202:58.62]Zin Shin, thanks for the $1.
[202:59.60]Hey, German, thank you for the high-quality content.
[203:02.10]You bring a lot of actual sheer joy to a lot of people's lives.
[203:05.21]Never forget that.
[203:06.39]Well, I have your attention.
[203:07.95]I wanted to ask, do you have any tattoos or piercings?
[203:11.71]Do you want any?
[203:14.03]I'm thinking about getting my ears pierced and getting a barbell through my dong.
[203:22.94]You kids.
[203:24.04]You kids.
[203:25.82]You kids.
[203:30.57]Well, even if this was a bait comment, I'm going to answer it.
[203:38.20]And if not, then good luck, because that sounds painful.
[203:41.76]First of all, no, I don't have any tattoos.
[203:43.14]I don't have any piercings.
[203:45.02]I'm glad I didn't get the one tattoo that I wanted to get about 10 years ago.
[203:49.48]I wanted to get the venom symbol.
[203:51.41]You know the thing on his chest?
[203:52.49]I wanted to get that on my left shoulder.
[203:55.64]So good thing I didn't do that because I probably would be like, oh, yikes.
[204:05.01]Come on.
[204:05.69]I know.
[204:06.13]Right.
[204:06.31]But look, I'm aware of that.
[204:08.01]I didn't go through with it.
[204:10.01]I was like 20, like 1920.
[204:11.55]Like, oh, yeah, we get the venom symbol right here.
[204:15.17]I look so fucking tough.
[204:18.00]Venom's like my favorite.
[204:18.94]Venom and Carnage are my two favorite Marvel characters.
[204:22.56]I love Carnage.
[204:23.22]I think he's great.
[204:24.68]I wish they'd put him in a goddamn movie.
[204:28.68]You were 22.
[204:29.43]I said about 10, I don't know, 10, 15, I don't know, whatever it was.
[204:33.45]I've been alive a long time.
[204:34.61]Sometimes the years mix together.
[204:40.47]But, no.
[204:41.29]I have no plans on any tattoos or piercings.
[204:45.30]Except a full carnage on my back.
[204:50.42]That sounded like a 12-year-old.
[204:54.40]20?
[204:54.44]That sounds like a 12- What?
[204:55.88]Give me a- Okay, hold on a second, guys.
[204:58.17]You're gonna give me shit for wanting, like, the Venom symbol on my arm when I'm 20?
[205:02.19]What about- What about the people that get, like, the Triforce on them at, like, 40?
[205:05.73]You know what I mean?
[205:08.51]What about the people that, like, get the Link Shield on them when they're fucking 31?
[205:11.79]Come on.
[205:17.97]You're never too old for like a gaming comic book tattoo.
[205:21.15]Give me a break.
[205:26.89]Well, I got to catch up.
[205:28.04]I'm 32.
[205:28.44]That's true.
[205:31.44]Somebody said, you know, that's true.
[205:32.68]I bet there's somebody in here with a Triforce tattoo.
[205:35.96]Speak up.
[205:36.94]Come on.
[205:38.32]Who in this chat has a Triforce tattoo?
[205:41.00]I don't care how big it is.
[205:43.10]One inch.
[205:44.28]Look at it.
[205:45.44]Four people, five people.
[205:47.85]Fess up.
[205:51.55]There's probably 300 people in here right now with a Triforce on the back of their calf.
[205:59.33]Some of you probably have all three of them.
[206:01.21]Maybe you got the Triforce of Wisdom in the middle of your chest, and then the other two, the Triforce of Courage and the Triforce of Strength.
[206:07.81]What is it?
[206:08.75]Courage, Wisdom...
[206:10.89]And enthusiasm.
[206:11.97]Somebody, yeah, one of you guys has the Triforce of Enthusiasm on the left calf, Triforce of Strength on the right one, and the Triforce of Wisdom in your chest.
[206:19.04]Come on.
[206:25.16]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[206:27.28]More big money.
[206:32.45]The Triforce is all three.
[206:33.83]Not when they're split up!
[206:35.47]It's just three triangles, and you'd have like, they'd be colored blue, red, and orange.
[206:44.35]Uh, KXE, thanks for the $50 right now.
[206:48.67]KXE, you've given a lot of money.

[208:51.69]I will check it out.
[208:52.35]I don't know what Nightmare Cops is.
[208:54.59]If it's cool, maybe.
[208:56.33]Hey Frekster, thanks for the $1.
[208:57.63]Stayed up till 4am just to run around like a headless chicken in Planetside.
[209:01.33]It was worth it.
[209:02.98]I think.
[209:06.56]Thank you.
[209:08.30]Leather jacket.
[209:09.80]One of our resident mods.
[209:10.68]Thank you for the $5, dude.
[209:11.36]Um.
[209:14.52]That was the worst idea I've ever had.
[209:16.71]I was expecting 20 to 30 people to join, not 130.
[209:19.93]I'm sorry everyone's ears never listen to me again.
[209:24.14]Although it was a good idea.
[209:29.44]We're starting with going to the Discord.
[209:33.66]It was a decent idea.
[209:34.72]It was a good idea.
[209:35.32]But, you know, it's just... That was just un... That was unmanageable.
[209:39.98]The whole scenario.
[209:40.78]So... It's all good.
[209:42.40]Don't worry, man.
[209:43.18]Thanks for the $5.
[209:43.92]Appreciate it, man.
[209:47.45]Whirlybird, thanks for the $10.
[209:50.03]Thank you, Whirlybird.
[209:51.43]Very fun stream tonight.
[209:52.47]Hope your headache isn't too bad.
[209:53.61]It's okay now.
[209:54.29]It just...
[209:56.96]When I start laughing really hard, immediately, when I think something's really funny, and it's just BANG!
[210:02.01]I get an explosion of funniness in my brain.
[210:05.61]I just, I get a headache instantly.
[210:08.05]Too much air comes out of my throat, and I'm just like, but it's worth it, always.
[210:13.67]Thank you, Whirlybird.
[210:16.07]Mighty Saturn!
[210:17.83]Thanks for the one dollar.
[210:19.70]German Saturn is still the best planet, and you're wrong if you say otherwise.
[210:26.11]Yeah.
[210:26.73]I mean, everybody has a favorite planet.
[210:30.93]My favorite planet is the moon, for sure, I think.
[210:34.49]Hey, Cap David, thanks for the $1.
[210:37.61]I didn't get the chance to say you're great in the Planetside 2 voice chat, so I'm going to say it here.
[210:43.15]You're absolutely great.
[210:44.45]Love you, dude.
[210:47.54]So are you.
[210:47.90]Thank you.
[210:49.86]Thank you for at least trying to participate in that Planetside 2 game.
[210:54.58]It was fun while it lasted.
[210:56.98]Thank you so much, Cap David.
[210:59.22]E-Dragon, thank you E-Dragon24 for the $20.
[211:02.20]20 bucks here from E-Dragon.
[211:04.64]Thank you so much, man.
[211:06.00]Hope your move to Vegas goes smoothly.
[211:07.58]Just remember to aim high in life, but watch out for flying boxes.
[211:17.01]I hope the Vegas move goes smooth too.
[211:21.61]You know, reach for the sky.
[211:22.73]The sky's the limit, right?
[211:24.75]Once you get, you know, reach for the sky.
[211:28.65]But don't go too close to the sun, you know?
[211:34.15]10 out of 10 advice.
[211:36.53]Thank you, E-Dragon, for the $20.
[211:37.47]And then right after that, Night Team 14 gave $15.
[211:43.59]Thank you, Night Team.
[211:45.95]Wish I could give you more, but here it is.
[211:48.64]You've always been my favorite.
[211:49.68]Here's to a new and better future in Las Vegas.
[211:52.40]By the way, what do you think of the submitted emotes so far?
[211:56.24]I've seen some interesting ones.
[211:59.17]I am not, I'm going to stay far back from this because I don't want to tell anybody anything.
[212:04.39]Me talking about an emote that I thought was funny immediately poisons the whole contest.
[212:11.50]So the whole thing has to get thrown in the trash.
[212:15.48]I will not say a damn thing.
[212:17.56]It's not up to me.
[212:18.70]This is a community chosen emote, so I don't want to stir the pot at all here.
[212:23.95]I don't want any bias.
[212:26.13]But I've seen some interesting things so far.
[212:29.30]Thank you so much, 19, for the $15.
[212:32.82]JokerGoat, thanks for the $1.
[212:34.80]This stream was good.
[212:35.76]It was so good.
[212:36.50]It was hilarious, just like the Jackbox one.
[212:39.90]I was laughing like crazy.
[212:41.16]Chad is great.
[212:42.06]The invading of every game was hilarious.
[212:44.60]We have to do this again.
[212:46.44]Love you, Jerma.
[212:46.98]Love you, Chad.
[212:48.40]Jerma's son.
[212:51.27]It was very fun.
[212:52.97]I gotta say, highlight of the night for me was the Pirates game.
[212:59.32]That was... You know what that really felt like being in that pirate game?
[213:03.48]That is the equivalent of how I would feel if I actually got thrown in the back of a garbage truck and the thing started to... That big metal rod was crushing everything together.
[213:14.27]Like it does.
[213:15.43]That was just a pirate ship back at the garbage truck.
[213:19.69]It was insane.
[213:22.17]Loved every second of it.
[213:25.01]Thank you Diet Drinky for the $1.00.
[213:27.97]Thank you, Stix Renegade, for the $1 again.
[213:30.47]All the time I try to convert my friends to watch you.
[213:33.32]Yesterday I showed my friend the video of you hysterically laughing at the scary baby running into the wall repeatedly.
[213:38.25]She was dying with laughter.
[213:39.49]Definitely one of your funniest moments.
[213:43.10]I that really that might be when people say like what's what's the what's your favorite thing that you've ever done or ever seen in a video game or like for video or stream wise that is that has to be that stream specifically that moment is absolutely in the top five top three most unbelievable things I've ever seen in a game without a doubt it might even be like one or two
[214:12.27]That was absolute just... It was just comedy.
[214:17.99]That was the... What was that?
[214:19.99]Horror game?
[214:21.23]What was it called?
[214:23.62]Oh, my God.
[214:24.02]Layers of Fear.
[214:24.58]That's what it is.
[214:25.00]Right.
[214:25.22]Thank you, Leatherjacket.
[214:27.48]Layers of Fear.
[214:32.82]Thank you, Sticks, though.
[214:34.60]Glad that other people are finding things to watch based on my content, and it's cool, and thank you.
[214:43.79]It's always interesting to me when people tell me that they're making their friends watch videos.
[214:48.39]Because I think about, I don't know.
[214:51.83]Then I go, why?
[214:52.33]Why do I not want people to watch?
[214:54.35]No, don't show your friend that video.
[214:56.55]I don't know why.
[214:57.81]Don't do that.
[214:59.49]What am I doing here?
[215:01.83]Isn't that what I want?
[215:03.71]Don't I want people to watch?
[215:08.40]But thank you.
[215:09.96]Thank you Cryptic Ascent for the $1.
[215:11.76]Jeremy, you ever looked into playing Hexen Beyond Heretic?
[215:15.01]It's by the people who made Doom.
[215:18.17]We probably will do one day.
[215:21.35]Like an old FPS night.
[215:23.97]Play like one of the old Dooms.
[215:25.29]Play like Strife.
[215:27.18]Play like the Hexen.
[215:28.96]We'll probably do that one night.
[215:30.92]Go through it like a couple days maybe.
[215:32.72]That'd be pretty fun.
[215:39.98]That could be interesting.
[215:44.64]Doom 2 has a Tim Allen mod.
[215:47.50]Well, that's... Of course it does.
[215:51.55]Thank you, Immortal Rack-a-lick.
[215:55.05]Immortal Drack-a-lick.
[215:57.77]Drack-a-litch.
[215:58.45]Thanks for the $1, man.
[215:59.91]Hey, German.
[216:00.19]Had fun playing Planetside 2 with you.

[216:02.41]Are you planning on ever revisiting Darkest Dungeon?
[216:05.45]It's got some good DLC and I really enjoyed watching you play it.
[216:09.19]Probably not.
[216:11.06]Darkest Dungeon is one of those games that I have to get into.
[216:14.88]And you don't just play Darkest Dungeon for a couple hours.
[216:19.40]You really have to put time into it to enjoy it.
[216:22.63]And I don't think there's any spot here in the next few weeks or few months where I have time to dump a bunch of time into Darkest Dungeons.

[218:46.38]No, let's go.
[218:46.86]Thanks for the $1.
[218:47.54]Hey, German, wanted to let you know that I'm very upset at you about Dark Souls.
[218:50.42]Oh, no.
[218:52.90]Why?
[218:53.16]You didn't do the important thing you need to do in every Soulsborne game.
[218:56.55]Read the item descriptions.
[218:59.84]Press X for more info.
[219:02.23]If you had read the description of the shield you had literally since the beginning of the game, the starting shield that you ended up with three copies of, you would know that one out of two... Two out of two, thanks for the $1, Nalesco.
[219:16.90]The spider shield blocks all poison damage, including the blow dart.
[219:21.18]Toxic from the tree, guys.
[219:23.99]When you get back to Dark Souls, please read all the descriptions for the items you have, even if you do it off stream.
[219:29.11]Thanks for being you anyway, even if you make me want to pull my hair out.
[219:33.60]Thank you.
[219:34.12]Now let's go.
[219:40.92]Didn't even read.
[219:43.23]I've read some of the items.
[219:44.77]We've gone through the item descriptions before.
[219:48.29]We've read some of them, I just don't read all of them.
[219:56.74]How dare you?
[219:58.74]No, it's alright.
[220:00.56]It's okay.
[220:02.22]No, I'll take the criticism I will.
[220:05.00]It's okay to be criticized for things that I'm not doing.
[220:08.10]Because that's how I gotta learn, right?
[220:14.37]Circus, circus.
[220:15.37]Why is circus, circus?
[220:17.77]Oh my god.
[220:23.59]That's my favorite casino!
[220:28.77]Crazy people don't have time to read.
[220:32.03]I'm not crazy.
[220:32.71]I'm just weird.
[220:34.57]No, am I?
[220:35.09]No, I'm not weird.
[220:35.93]I'm just crazy.
[220:37.72]How am I gonna say this correctly?
[220:40.94]I'm not crazy.
[220:42.86]No, I'm not weird.
[220:43.82]I'm just a little crazy.
[220:44.64]There you go.
[220:46.64]Okay, thank you.
[220:47.54]Now let's go for the one dollar.
[220:50.58]I'm not crazy and I'm not fucking weird at all.
[220:52.21]You just see me off stream.
[220:53.07]You know what I do?
[220:53.57]This.
[221:21.37]Ooh, that was a little loud.
[221:26.08]Cocaine?
[221:27.36]Get out of here!
[221:28.06]Get out of here!
[221:32.92]Is he pooping his pants?
[221:34.02]I've done that before.
[221:34.86]You all have.
[221:35.36]Don't fucking judge me.
[221:36.44]How many?
[221:36.98]Okay, how many guys?
[221:37.86]How many of you have a Triforce tattoo?
[221:39.52]Ooh, probably have a Triforce.
[221:41.57]And thank you, Vase.
[221:43.47]Vase.
[221:44.95]For the one dollar here.
[221:47.15]Also, thank you for your nearly one hundred dollars.
[221:51.61]Thanks a lot, man.
[221:53.09]And you say, hey, Germa, my name is pronounced like vice, by the way.
[221:56.14]Thank you for the correction.
[221:57.06]I will forever call you vice because I'm a moron.
[222:01.34]Is my girlfriend moving with Vegas?
[222:03.72]Moving to Vegas with me.
[222:05.85]Also, I have a dream with you in them all the time.
[222:09.11]It's a little weird, to be honest.
[222:10.33]Also, my boyfriend said you're just going to Vegas for a vacation.
[222:13.49]Are you moving or vacationing?
[222:16.06]Also, I wanted to ask.
[222:16.90]Are you something full-time or are you like a waiter too?
[222:19.90]Because someone said you were a waiter and didn't believe me.
[222:25.16]Uh, well.
[222:26.48]Let's go over a couple of these.
[222:29.40]Uh, yeah.
[222:29.98]The plan is for Kim to come.
[222:32.84]That is the plan.
[222:35.18]We'll see.
[222:35.44]I don't know.
[222:37.42]I haven't really been talking about, like, who's going?
[222:40.27]Because it's... You never want to say, like...
[222:44.16]This person is coming.
[222:45.56]Or this person is coming.
[222:46.90]And that's the house.
[222:48.46]And then, I don't know, something comes up.
[222:50.73]Maybe they can't.
[222:51.71]You just don't want to put that kind of pressure on somebody.
[222:54.85]That may or may not.
[222:55.81]You know what I'm saying?
[222:57.39]Is Otto going?
[222:58.11]Absolutely.
[222:59.53]Otto has to go.
[223:00.47]He's my best friend.
[223:03.58]Oh, Burger Boy coming?
[223:04.58]No, Burger Boy's not going.
[223:05.78]Burger Boy has like a family.
[223:10.10]People are still voting on the straw poll.
[223:13.69]Which straw poll?
[223:14.67]The planet side straw poll?
[223:28.18]What?
[223:28.48]Yes.
[223:29.18]Like what faction to pick?
[223:32.54]That's so funny.
[223:35.75]But that's that question.
[223:37.99]And was I ever a waiter?
[223:41.49]I used to bus tables.
[223:44.49]I wasn't really a waiter did I ever tell I don't even remember telling anybody that I was a waiter I bust tables at a place before I don't know where the waiter thing came from I think I've mentioned it that was a waiter like a waiter I mentioned it in your undertale stream did I say that
[224:14.69]Why would I say I'm a waiter?
[224:17.39]Was I, like, trying to fuck around with people?
[224:19.65]I don't know.
[224:26.52]I'm fucking crazy.
[224:28.90]And I'm a waiter, and... I don't know.
[224:30.86]I don't remember half the things I ever say.
[224:32.22]But no, I really was a substitute teacher.
[224:35.80]That's true.
[224:36.52]That's not, like, me fucking around.
[224:41.63]Is that an old Q&A video?
[224:43.83]Yeah, guys, I'm a waiter.
[224:44.94]Fuck.
[224:50.24]But, yes.
[224:50.64]Remember I told you 95% of things I say aren't true?
[224:54.72]Well, me being a substitute teacher is one of those true things.
[224:57.60]That was for real.
[224:58.87]And I did used to make wedding videos as well.
[225:00.57]So, no, why would I ever... I don't know where this is coming from, but...
[225:08.52]Do you have any interesting waiter stories?
[225:10.39]Yeah.
[225:10.91]Oh my god.
[225:12.07]One time, this couple comes in, right?
[225:14.85]And they've had a reservation for their anniversary.
[225:18.88]They come up, they get to the hostess, they sit down, they're dressed.
[225:21.96]He's in a suit and she's in a dress, right?
[225:24.36]I walk over there and I've already had like four or five drinks.
[225:29.34]Like shit-faced on the job.
[225:30.47]It was terrible.
[225:31.09]I did it like once every like three months.
[225:34.29]There was a company party that was right before they came in and I wasn't prepared for it, but whatever.
[225:39.85]They sat down.
[225:40.47]I'm sitting there taking the rotor.
[225:41.65]I'm like, ma'am, what would you like for you?
[225:43.97]The special tonight is the clam chowder.
[225:45.78]I recommend it wholeheartedly.
[225:47.04]It's fantastic, by the way.
[225:48.62]I love your hair.
[225:49.30]It looks fantastic.
[225:50.32]Any occasion here tonight?
[225:51.52]Any occasion tonight?
[225:53.30]And the husband of, I think, who it was said...
[225:56.74]Oh, yes, we're here for our anniversary.
[225:59.71]Oh, anniversary.
[226:00.67]How many years?
[226:01.49]How many years are you two?
[226:02.93]Let me guess, let me guess.
[226:04.13]Let me guess, 25.
[226:05.80]Bingo, I nailed it.
[226:06.66]That was shit-faced, but I still nailed it.
[226:09.00]And the woman opens her mouth in total shock.
[226:12.96]And I threw a piece of chocolate.
[226:15.65]I used to keep it in my front pocket.
[226:17.69]We don't.
[226:18.19]And she ate it.
[226:19.37]She went right down her throat.
[226:21.93]And it was the best chocolate we ever had.
[226:23.71]We used to do that.
[226:25.05]People knew what was going to happen.
[226:26.70]It was like a chocolate restaurant.
[226:28.96]It was seafood and chocolate.
[226:30.96]People knew that was what was going to happen.
[226:32.28]So it wasn't like a thing where we were doing it when people didn't want it.
[226:35.72]Um, so she ate the chocolate and, uh, it went, she was happy about it.
[226:40.01]I got it right.
[226:41.05]But here's the sad part, right?
[226:42.23]So they ordered their food.
[226:43.57]I don't know, some fucked up dish that like sucks.
[226:46.29]That was like overexpensively priced, like a salmon with a piece of like cheese on it or something with like a twig next to it.
[226:52.36]So I take their order, I come up with the salmon, and that fucking chocolate that I just talked about there, that was sitting in the front pocket, because it's really expensive, and we had to pay for it ourselves.
[227:03.05]So I had to pay for, like, the $50 or $60 in chocolate that was in my... But it got really good tips when we did that throat-in-the-mouth thing.
[227:10.82]So, I could start to feel, as I was bringing out the salmon, and, uh, the, I think, I don't know what, it was a spaghetti dish, it was the other hand.
[227:19.28]So I'm coming out there with it, I can feel the chocolate start to move around a little bit in the pocket, and, fuck, I don't want to lose, this is a hundred bucks, man, it's like sixty fucking dollars in my paycheck, I get paid nine dollars an hour, this is, I can't lose this.
[227:29.75]So I put my elbow in, and, trying to, like, push it into the front pocket so I didn't drop it, because they were pouring out, I had a lot in there, and I tried, I took the other hand, and I started to drop the fucking salmon,
[227:40.94]crash smash onto the onto the fucking ground smashed like to the whole plate her whole salmon dinner and She looks over at me, and I'll never forget it.
[227:49.38]She opened her mouth really fucking wide what and I took fucking Instantly this is the smart fucking thought that I have as a waiter Wham chocolate across the room.
[228:00.04]I was a hundred and fifty probably yards away.
[228:02.56]There's a huge restaurant chocolate
[228:05.53]Over a fucking, there was a huge tall guy in the way over his hat, he had a big hat on, arced it over the whole thing, went right into her mouth, right down her throat.
[228:13.37]And then the whole place erupted in fucking applause and laughter.
[228:19.75]And I saved my job, and not only that, not only that, went over and apologized.
[228:23.77]Oh my god, I can't believe what I did, I'm such an idiot, but hey, from downtown, right?
[228:28.33]She put her hand up, I put my hand up too, we slapped high fives, and I got an $150 tip that night.
[228:36.06]And by the way, none of that was real.
[228:38.58]Uh, at all.
[228:39.32]None of it.
[228:39.86]Not even the first part.
[228:40.90]Not even... I'm not a waiter.
[228:43.66]Thank you, Sleepy Pigeon, for the one dollar.
[228:47.14]And they say... Uh... Well, it just disappeared.
[228:54.69]No shit.
[228:58.05]Oh, and by the way, that woman's name... She would go on to be, uh...
[229:08.84]She would go on to be Margaret Thatcher.
[229:15.04]Who was the British Prime Minister.
[229:29.01]Oh, by the way, I was fucking huge.
[229:33.65]Did you just Google that?
[229:34.45]Yeah, I just want to make sure it was who I thought it was.
[229:40.65]But anyways, Vice to give you a complete roundabout answer here.
[229:46.37]Streaming... Streaming and it's pretty much, I would say, where I get all of my income from at this point.
[229:56.82]Now over the years that has obviously changed.
[230:00.20]Like I said, I used to do wedding videography back when I first was doing YouTube for the first while.
[230:05.61]I've worked at random little odd jobs, but as of right now, this is where I get all of my income from.
[230:15.55]I'm gonna lose everything.
[230:19.91]It's my gambling.
[230:20.99]The gambling holds it back.
[230:23.33]Pretty much sounds like he has a secret income.
[230:25.41]Crypto fucking currency trading.
[230:27.49]I already told you guys this.
[230:28.43]I have like $140 in Momise Go.
[230:39.31]$140!
[230:39.51]I'm gonna make it one day, I swear!
[230:55.27]Income from the rat movie?
[230:59.33]No.
[231:01.01]Anyways, let's... Let's keep going.
[231:07.48]We're almost done.
[231:10.23]Where, where, where, where were we, where were we?
[231:13.71]Hey, Bonebrew, thanks for the one dollar.
[231:15.33]Hey, Derma.
[231:17.01]Tried to capture some of the craziness earlier.
[231:18.55]Uh... Capture some of the craziness earlier.
[231:25.88]What are you talking about?
[231:29.12]What?
[231:29.36]This is like a broken link.
[231:42.22]Click it.
[231:43.16]Get it.
[231:43.52]Hold on.
[231:49.40]What?
[231:49.66]Why am I... I can't... Why can I not... Stop whispering.
[232:02.33]I don't know why... My... Oh, my... I... This is like YouTube, like, dot... What is this?
[232:12.95]I'm not whispering, I'm talking normally!
[232:18.04]There we go, now can I please copy that?
[232:22.90]Oh my fucking god, why is this doing this to me?
[232:29.85]Alright, we're gonna have to go back to this.
[232:32.09]Because I can't get it, for some stupid reason.
[232:39.34]Getting fished.
[232:41.18]Oh, I'm gonna get fished on stream.
[232:43.76]No.
[232:44.26]That's not what's going on.
[232:46.72]Yeah, I think I got it.
[232:47.94]Did I?
[232:50.94]There we go.
[232:51.40]Okay.
[232:56.81]There we go.
[232:58.27]There we go.
[232:59.27]Oh, this is like a four and a half minute video.
[233:08.67]What is this?
[233:15.05]I can't believe we did this.
[233:16.23]People are like coughing and puking.
[233:22.74]Holy shit, dude.
[233:25.70]Me watching this after doing it is... We were having a... There was a convention in that room.
[233:36.59]That was a planetside convention that we all went to.
[233:43.79]What is this one?
[233:46.31]Get him!
[233:51.72]You can't even see what the fuck is going on.
[233:55.60]The fucking boat just drives over us.
[234:00.22]Oh my god.
[234:01.36]What a fun time.
[234:02.64]I had a great time.
[234:06.89]But thank you, Bonebrew, for that insanity.
[234:10.44]Hey, Spreo, thanks for the $10.
[234:11.74]Haven't watched this stream, so I'll give you $10 to allow myself to experience this clusterfuck of a stream.
[234:18.04]It is a clusterfuck, so good luck, Spreo.
[234:20.70]It's very fun.
[234:23.94]Biops, Chossy Biops, I was actually the captain of the boat you were on.
[234:27.24]It was great having you.
[234:28.24]It was great being there.
[234:29.32]Thank you.
[234:30.96]Thanks for allowing us on your boat.
[234:34.89]Uh, Immortal, Immortal Dr. Rackalick.
[234:39.51]Thank you, Immortal, for the $9.
[234:42.05]Also, I'm going to Europe for the next couple of weeks, so sadly, I will miss your next couple of streams.
[234:46.24]Please take my money as an apology.
[234:49.28]Uh, well, you are forgiven.
[234:51.72]You are forgiven.
[234:58.51]Thank you for the nearly $10.
[235:00.11]Good luck on your trip.
[235:00.99]Hopefully, it's fun.
[235:03.21]See you when you get back.
[235:05.44]Uh, Erdemius!
[235:07.18]Thank you for the one dollar.
[235:08.04]Uh, well, it's always a pleasure to meet anybody.
[235:36.48]Happy to shake hands and talk about stuff.
[235:40.27]A big funny internet sound.
[235:45.27]It is... It's nice to know that... I'm not sure.
[235:49.01]It might not be nice or I'm not sure how to think of people thinking maybe that that was not my real family.
[235:54.86]It's... You know, I mean, they're not crazy.
[235:57.70]We're crazy, you know.
[235:58.88]No, not crazy.
[235:59.42]We're weird, right?
[236:00.10]Not crazy.
[236:00.58]We're weird.
[236:00.96]Not crazy.
[236:02.91]But, uh, how could you introduce your friends to stuff that I've done?
[236:06.33]That's on you.
[236:07.31]That's up to you, because... I feel like there's been so much different... There's been so many different videos and so many different streams and so many ways to watch these things, right?
[236:20.65]I mean, I don't know if I would introduce, like, a Team Fortress 2 video.
[236:24.41]Because, oh, I love Team Fortress 2!
[236:26.31]This guy plays Team Fortress 2?
[236:27.63]Oh, I can't wait for more of that!
[236:29.74]It's not gonna happen, you know?
[236:34.05]So, it really depends on... I guess you have to gauge what they like.
[236:38.75]You know, I can't tell you what to start with because I feel like there's, you know, made like a thousand videos over the years and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of live streams.
[236:49.43]So, I don't know.
[236:52.50]I'm not sure.
[236:54.80]You don't have a video resume to show to movie producers?
[236:57.12]No.
[236:59.18]No.
[237:04.92]Uh, but thank you.
[237:07.58]Thank you, thank you.
[237:08.06]Um... I don't know.
[237:08.92]I don't think I've ever had one.
[237:09.72]I think the strangest fan experience I've ever had was being recognized
[237:32.23]In... At my local mall.
[237:34.74]That was probably the weird one.
[237:37.44]Local mall... It's not... In like a real... It's not a place where you would expect to see a ton of people.
[237:47.20]And... The interaction was not weird at all.
[237:50.76]It was a very nice, very pleasant experience.
[237:53.33]But it was really weird just knowing that... No fucking way would anybody ever meet me here.
[237:58.95]And ran into somebody...
[238:01.62]And it was like, hey, Jerma!
[238:03.30]And I'm just sitting there going, there's no way.
[238:06.34]I'm all the way out here.
[238:08.75]There's no way.
[238:10.77]So, the interaction was fine.
[238:13.15]The guy was really pleasant, really nice, and it was a great experience to talk to him.
[238:17.73]But it was just, the place was just like, wow, that's remarkable.
[238:24.42]You made it there.
[238:25.22]You worked there.
[238:29.40]You're moving to Vegas.
[238:30.24]Yes.
[238:32.52]Well, man, maybe we'll bump elbows.
[238:34.84]That means like we're going to bump into each other, right?
[238:36.80]Hold on.
[238:41.21]Okay.
[238:41.59]Yep.
[238:41.95]Yes, yes, yes.
[238:44.01]To rub elbows with somebody is informal to meet and spend some time with them.
[238:47.09]Okay.
[238:47.47]Just making sure that I had that right.
[238:58.03]I, yeah.
[238:59.06]Okay.
[238:59.44]Well, that's good.
[239:00.16]Maybe I'll bump elbows with you.
[239:04.09]Thank you Royal Rogue for the $1 for the next free MMO stream.
[239:07.27]Final Fantasy XIV is free to start.
[239:09.69]So that could work.
[239:10.31]Stream was great.
[239:10.95]The planetside thing had me laughing myself sick.
[239:15.75]I don't think I'll play Final Fantasy XIV just because... I'm not like... I don't want to play any of the mainstream MMOs.
[239:24.88]Like the Warcrafts, like the Elder Scrolls, like Final Fantasy.
[239:29.68]What's another one that's... Do people still play...
[239:33.94]What the hell is it?
[239:34.48]It was like a Warcraft game kind of... What's it fucking called?
[239:42.94]Terra.
[239:43.62]Terra.
[239:44.00]Terra is another one.
[239:45.72]Like Black Desert Online.
[239:46.95]These are games I probably wouldn't play.
[239:52.39]But... Appreciate the... Recommendation.
[239:56.81]And thank you.
[239:57.77]Thank you, your boy, for the $15.
[239:59.53]Thanks a lot, man.
[240:02.47]Here's some bits for your explosion of funniness in your brain.
[240:06.51]Love your content, man.
[240:07.23]You made me laugh more times than I can count.
[240:08.79]Thank you so much.
[240:13.28]Thank you for the $15, you boy.
[240:15.56]Appreciate it deeply.
[240:17.74]CluelessSniper, thanks for the $1.
[240:19.30]I missed the entire stream and about to watch the VOD.
[240:21.38]I just want to say I love everything you do.
[240:24.44]You're the most creative person I know and I can't wait to see what you have planned in the future.
[240:30.26]Hopefully, stuff that's worth watching.
[240:33.26]Hopefully.
[240:35.30]I'm going to try.
[240:36.24]But thanks for sticking around for as long as you have, man.
[240:38.08]Thank you.
[240:39.76]Spooge, thanks for the $1.
[240:41.32]Hey, Jerma, first time bidder.
[240:43.63]I love every stream you've done and I always be around to watch.
[240:46.63]Been watching since TF2 on YouTube.
[240:48.79]I've never gotten around to subbing.
[240:50.67]Anyways, I hope you know that there are a lot of chat that do want to enjoy playing games with you and messing around and not trying to ruin it for everyone.
[240:58.38]Much love, Jerma.
[240:59.10]Thank you so much, Spooge.
[241:02.22]No, I know that I'm aware of that and I but the thing is it does all it takes is a thing It it just takes one guy to piss into the pot for nobody to want to eat the food That's just what happens, right?
[241:15.05]If you have a thousand people standing at a bit of room and we all are looking forward to eating the stew It's the but you know, the world famous chef is making that stew.
[241:25.01]I'm sitting there.
[241:25.51]I can't wait to eat that fucking stew It's gonna be great
[241:28.47]One of us has to stand up and go pissing at.
[241:30.54]Just unzip your pants and pee into the pot of food.
[241:33.84]And everybody's not going to eat it.
[241:35.78]It's over.
[241:36.08]And you're going to make a whole new food.
[241:38.52]You're going to make a whole new food.
[241:40.89]So.
[241:42.67]That's the unfortunate truth of stuff like that.
[241:48.79]But whenever it's possible, I'll try to do it, you know.
[241:56.83]I will try it when I can.
[242:00.33]But thank you.
[242:00.87]Thank you Level27Warrior for the $1.
[242:03.15]Keep up the great streams.
[242:04.09]Good luck on the move.
[242:04.73]Thank you.
[242:06.91]Hopefully it goes smooth.
[242:07.77]I agree.
[242:09.35]AsianTurtle, thanks for the $1.
[242:10.75]Hey Jermbo, have you thought about doing a Twitch talent show?
[242:14.07]You could use viewer-submitted clips and have chat judge them.
[242:17.33]Had the idea a while back and just remembered it.
[242:18.93]Thought you might like it.
[242:20.25]Also, you should check out the game Lifeline for PS2.
[242:22.43]It uses voice command technology to control the game.
[242:26.99]I think I actually looked into Lifeline.
[242:31.91]I might even be in my cart in Amazon.
[242:37.44]But yeah, I'm open to a lot of interesting things.
[242:41.34]Now, would that be like clips of people doing things or clips of the stream?
[242:46.56]Like you're talking about clips of people juggling and shit, right?
[242:51.51]But you've got to be careful with stuff like that because obviously that's like a mess to manage.
[242:59.30]We'll see.
[243:00.46]Definitely a good idea.
[243:02.24]Thank you, Spreo, for the $1.
[243:03.44]Where's that rat song you were talking about in the worm stream?
[243:07.50]Under lock and key.
[243:09.28]Thank you, Bite, for the $1.
[243:10.64]It's me again.
[243:11.40]Chat seems so confused in my last bit comment.
[243:14.08]Well, I'll keep it secret myself.
[243:15.47]Don't want to spoil it.
[243:17.65]Cough.
[243:19.29]1,200 angry men and women cough.
[243:25.67]Thank you.
[243:27.66]Thank you to Nolesco for the $1.
[243:29.22]Hey again, Germ.
[243:30.22]Sorry for the multi-tweeting you my rant.
[243:33.18]But you lost your mind over the toxic dudes.
[243:36.08]And knowing you had the spider shield in your inventory four times over and never looked, if you looked at it, it gave me secondhand crazies.
[243:42.12]Anyway, I love you and I'm outside your house with my printed diatribe on the proper way to play Dark Souls.
[243:46.84]Please open the door.
[243:56.15]One of these days, one of you guys will really be there.
[243:58.13]That's, like, scary.
[243:59.77]One of these days, that joke's not gonna be a joke.
[244:01.61]It's gonna be real.
[244:05.81]Look outside.
[244:07.69]Hey, thank you, Lucky Bone, for the three bucks.
[244:11.31]Jerma really liked the stream tonight.
[244:12.69]Don't have much right now.
[244:14.35]Don't get paid till Thursday.
[244:17.57]I'm glad you liked it.
[244:18.27]Thanks for the three bucks.
[244:19.11]Don't ever feel obligated to ever give me money for any reason.
[244:21.35]But thank you.
[244:22.87]Glad you liked it.
[244:24.47]Hey, Immortal Rackalich, thanks for the $5 again.
[244:27.27]Sorry to spam your bits, Jerma.
[244:29.57]Don't worry about that at all.
[244:31.26]But please, for the love of God, do a D&D stream.
[244:33.38]That would be so much fun.
[244:34.36]I think you'd love it.
[244:35.10]I know I certainly would.
[244:37.90]My brain is too... I need... I can't play D&D.
[244:43.61]I came to this realization a long time ago.
[244:45.99]I can't sit there and just wait for things to happen.
[244:51.78]I need, like, immediate things happening.
[244:54.40]My brain is so ADHD, it's hard for me to sit and listen and roll the dice to move and then watch out, though.
[245:02.16]Roll the dice again.
[245:03.32]I'm just like, stab him!
[245:04.45]Fucking stick a sword in his head!
[245:08.61]But, yeah, I've tried to play it before.
[245:16.84]But, thank you.
[245:19.52]Uh, Dubskidoo, thanks for the $1.
[245:21.20]Tried hunting you down in Planetside, but the closest I got was being in the same plane as you for about 60 seconds.
[245:27.27]Feels bad, man.
[245:28.93]Also, as much as this game angers me, you definitely need to play Totally Accurate Battlegrounds.
[245:33.85]It's a PUBG-style funny-haha meme game.
[245:36.90]Chat would love it.
[245:40.60]Should I play, like, the funny-haha streamer-youtuber-funny-haha game?
[245:43.78]Meme game?
[245:44.08]Meme game?
[245:46.55]Maybe like one or two rounds.
[245:47.61]Maybe.
[245:54.65]It looked kind of interesting.
[245:59.16]Maybe.
[246:00.06]Maybe one day.
[246:02.04]Thank you, Frexter, for the $4.
[246:04.52]My sister thinks you're too loud.
[246:06.68]And my friend thinks you talk too fast.
[246:17.07]Yeah, well, they're right.
[246:18.39]They're probably right.
[246:20.09]God damn it.
[246:24.85]Time to become an ASMR streamer instead.
[246:27.07]There's an untapped market for you there.
[246:29.21]Just wait.
[246:30.15]You'll see.
[246:32.45]Just wait.
[246:35.56]Just hold on.
[246:40.24]Prepare for that.
[246:42.04]Thank you, Byte, for the $1.
[246:43.22]Byte1223.
[246:46.58]I have to get rid of my last 100 bits, so here's a photo of my dog I took.
[246:49.43]Enjoy.
[246:49.95]Photo of your dog.
[246:50.55]Let's take a look at your dog.
[246:52.91]Now that, that is a dog.
[246:54.49]That's a cute dog.
[246:55.25]That's a little fox dog.
[246:57.89]Looks like a fox.
[246:59.23]He's very cute.
[247:03.33]Show it.
[247:04.71]Show it.
[247:05.07]Show it.
[247:05.39]Hold on.
[247:05.77]Hold on.
[247:06.11]Hold on.
[247:06.41]I'm showing it.
[247:09.35]Look at how cute this dog is.
[247:12.70]Look at that, like, fox dog.
[247:16.61]What kind of dog is that?
[247:19.10]Show the fucking dog.
[247:20.34]I just did... Oh my god.
[247:25.32]Hey, Lorag, thanks for the ten bucks.
[247:29.44]Thank you, Lorag.
[247:30.47]Hey, be the best that you can and put your pedal to the metal.
[247:32.85]Vin Diesel said that.
[247:33.73]Yes, he did.
[247:37.33]Thank you so much, Lorag, for the ten bucks.
[247:38.93]And final, final, final, final bits here.
[247:41.88]Thank you to Gav Makes Games for the one dollar.
[247:45.78]Hey, Jerma, thanks for taking a picture with my mom at PAX.
[247:49.25]Absolutely.
[247:54.21]I love taking pictures, especially when I look at them afterwards and I see them tweeted and I look like a dickhead.
[247:58.51]It's happened a few times where it's like, oh, hey, thanks for the picture, Jerma.
[248:01.50]And I'm like, oh, let me see it.
[248:02.54]And I have like... But for real, thank you.
[248:12.44]And with that, I will see you guys on Tuesday.
[248:14.97]Nothing tomorrow.
[248:16.49]Going back to Dark Souls.
[248:18.09]Remastered edition.
[248:20.55]Thank you for participating tonight.
[248:22.13]Thanks for making it more fun.
[248:24.31]Because without you, this stream doesn't do anything.
[248:28.29]Without you guys, this stream is just me playing MMOs.
[248:33.76]Thanks so much.
[248:35.22]Have a great rest of your night.
[248:36.34]See you on Tuesday.
[248:37.18]Same time.
[248:38.78]Have a good one.
[248:51.18]Thank you.
