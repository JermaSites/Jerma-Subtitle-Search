[00:09.41]I'm just gonna stick this Medi Gun up your ass.
[00:13.21]And we're gonna kill everybody.
[00:14.83]That sounds fine.
[00:15.61]I'll grab, uh... The Righteous Bison.
[00:25.47]Oh, you can juggle?
[00:26.12]I didn't know you could juggle, Jerma.
[00:28.46]I learned how to the other day when I was bored waiting for my, uh... anal exam.
[00:35.70]Oh, really?
[00:36.12]How'd that go?
[00:38.19]They put the juggle in my butt.
[00:41.28]What's a juggle?
[00:43.28]Oh, right.
[00:44.00]We were just talking about juggling.
[00:48.06]I don't know that it's a noun, but I mean... They put the juggle.
[00:54.15]Is it time?
[00:54.85]Is it time?
[00:55.45]Is it time?
[00:56.17]Not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet.
[00:57.97]Use it.
[01:00.37]I needed it for that NG, because screw NGs.
[01:02.29]Watch out behind the scout.
[01:05.57]There's like no one here now.
[01:07.92]Yeah.
[01:08.58]Oh, backstab, watch out, turn around, turn around.
[01:10.74]I was... Could have gone better.
[01:13.90]There was, like, a whole nest up there a second ago.
[01:16.98]I could have sworn.
[01:17.80]At least we got out and did things.
[01:20.82]Hey, that's all that matters.
[01:23.70]Shot a guy.
[01:24.72]Killed an engineer.
[01:25.60]That's top priority.
[01:28.74]Mini-century engineer, that is, like, priority number one.
[01:34.96]That sounds smash.
[01:35.82]You know we're going to go around the back.
[01:37.74]I'll try for that spy too, because he's like always killing me because I'm Jerma.
[01:46.59]Oh!
[01:47.95]What was that?
[01:50.65]Oh no, I'm like in shock.
[01:52.86]I'm going to die.
[01:55.16]That was outrageous looking.
[01:57.80]I got a double kill with the crit rocket.
[01:59.52]Like I was standing there just like waiting to see who it would hit and that got me killed.
[02:05.19]That was very, very crazy looking on my screen.
[02:08.25]It looked like you just disconnected from the game.
[02:12.51]Are you dead?
[02:13.37]No, I'm alive.
[02:14.19]I made it out.
[02:15.45]Jeez.
[02:19.00]I feel like I've done nothing.
[02:21.66]Oh, bye.
[02:22.68]That was a nice jump.
[02:23.96]You ready, Jerma?
[02:25.16]No, not yet.
[02:26.16]There's no one here.
[02:27.18]Oh, let me heal this guy.
[02:29.31]I'm out.
[02:37.78]Oh boy, oh boy, I'm gonna die.
[02:40.24]I had to run.
[02:41.08]Okay, I'm coming with you.
[02:43.00]Where you be?
[02:43.82]I'm on the cart.
[02:44.52]Just trying to get some health.
[02:45.58]Oh, I forgot I had the... Oh my god!
[02:51.38]Dude, you went 10,000 feet in the air!
[02:54.82]What keeps happening to you?
[02:56.40]I don't know, but at least I'm doing it spectacularly.
[02:59.00]I mean, if you're gonna die, make a scene of it.
[03:04.40]And... We need, like, six snipers standing in the same spot for you to get, like, a quadruple twozer kill.
[03:18.63]Oh!
[03:19.17]Oh, he jumped down.
[03:22.85]Going for it!
[03:23.81]Oh, you... Oh, he took so much damage.
[03:27.47]Let's back up.
[03:28.29]We can't be here.
[03:28.91]This is scary.
[03:30.37]Gotta get on that cat.
[03:32.48]Oh, no, they're kind of, like, camping them.
[03:33.82]Maybe we can stay here.
[03:36.24]Kind of... Where's the red team?
[03:38.70]I don't know.
[03:41.79]Where the hell is the other team?
[03:42.83]What's going on?
[03:44.95]Oh, I got creeped out.
[03:45.75]Let's reload the bison.
[03:46.55]And here it goes.
[03:49.75]Use it.
[03:49.99]I'm going up.
[03:57.39]Ooh.
[03:58.19]That was pretty... Oh, backstab.
[04:01.69]That's okay.
[04:02.21]I think we are winners.
[04:03.95]I'm gonna go scalp.
[04:06.11]I'm gonna go scalp just to run on the cot.
[04:07.55]Just sprint on it.
[04:08.81]Oh yeah, I got him pretty good here at spawn.
[04:13.45]This is how we do it.
[04:15.39]Yeah, I top-fragged him.
[04:16.54]Oh man.
[04:17.00]That round was so dumb.
[04:18.62]Top-fragged again.
[04:32.69]Okay, I'll play the Solyman.
[04:36.81]The soldier is a spy!
[04:38.91]The heavy is a spy!
[04:40.31]The heavy is a sniper!
[04:43.75]What?
[04:45.74]Good job.
[04:47.20]Should've prayed harder.
[04:48.70]What, did he just, like, shoot him in the friggin' door?
[04:51.08]No, there was, like, a hundred of them at the gate, like, how they always place them there.
[04:55.46]Yeah, I was, like, standing where the train tracks are, like, behind the cart.
[04:59.42]Oh, I think some of them got blown back by an explosion.
[05:02.60]Okay.
[05:03.82]Makes sense.
[05:07.48]There we go.
[05:07.98]Prey.
[05:09.32]Hello, Jarrah.
[05:10.28]Anybody in there?
[05:11.22]I'm you.
[05:13.36]I'm also burning to death.
[05:15.25]Somebody in there.
[05:15.95]Somebody in there.
[05:16.55]I just heard the ding.
[05:17.35]There's no one in there.
[05:18.09]I heard the ding.
[05:18.81]I heard the ding.
[05:19.67]What's the ding?
[05:20.83]It goes ding.
[05:21.13]Who dings?
[05:21.81]Which class ding?
[05:22.73]Oh, the ding?
[05:24.65]I heard a ding.
[05:29.21]Oh, a lot of stuff going on up here.
[05:34.52]I love how that guy just thought this was an actual built dispenser.
[05:38.02]I've done that so many times before.
[05:39.70]I keep thinking that, like, I'm not used to that yet.
[05:42.55]I've seen the sentries do that, but I don't know.
[05:45.27]What, why?
[05:45.59]I feel like the dispensers are newer.
[05:47.39]You think they would fix that?
[05:49.15]You think they wouldn't fix, like, the invisible players?
[05:52.45]You'd think they would fix a lot of things.
[05:54.71]Like Heavy's hands disappearing.
[05:57.71]Valve, what the heck?
[06:01.33]Man.
[06:06.50]Hey, come up left with me.
[06:07.56]We gotta be one again.
[06:08.52]Come over here.
[06:08.96]I'm right over here.
[06:09.60]Hey, how's it going?
[06:11.00]Let's go adventure.
[06:15.58]Wait for this to open.
[06:16.80]Just wait here.
[06:17.84]Just crouch in the corner with me.
[06:19.04]We're gonna have a good time.
[06:21.16]Don't shoot.
[06:22.20]Hold your fire.
[06:27.29]Mini sentry.
[06:28.01]Don't think so.
[06:31.23]I think we're winning.
[06:32.21]Yeah, looks like it.
[06:35.33]We have the heavy.
[06:38.41]No, don't you think about it.
[06:39.79]Don't you think about it.
[06:43.09]I am in desperate need of a medic.
[06:45.90]Big time.
[06:50.58]Or this health pack, thanks.
[06:55.48]Mini-century, where are you?
[06:57.24]Where?
[07:00.86]There's a mini-century in that gray gravel co-building, and I'm afraid to go over and do anything about it.
[07:05.26]Oh, it's gone.
[07:12.08]Bang.
[07:14.66]I could smell you, Scout.
[07:17.22]I'm right behind ya.
[07:19.62]Just keep walking forward.
[07:23.35]Oh, sentry.
[07:29.69]Whoa.
[07:32.67]You didn't walk forward with me.
[07:34.87]Top left.
[07:35.81]Oh, I'm up there.
[07:37.40]Oh, there's a lot of people up there.
[07:38.98]I'm up there.
[07:40.88]Oh my god, there's a heavy one!
[07:42.90]We did it!
[07:45.51]He got 50 points for just standing on the cart the whole time.
[07:49.25]Wow.
[07:49.75]Wow, he really did.
[07:50.55]He really got 50.
[07:51.31]30 above everyone else just for... I'm gonna stand on the cart.
