[00:01.80]Let's get him!
[00:20.75]Hello there.
[00:21.41]Welcome back to Tip of the Hats 2016.
[00:23.88]We've got a pub section coming up for you.
[00:26.00]We've got some players over there.
[00:27.22]They're warming up.
[00:27.96]They're ready to go with the pub.
[00:29.52]And also, on the couch with us, we've got the ever-stylish Mr. Slin and Admarble.
[00:35.85]I thought you were going to talk about him.
[00:36.91]He looks way sick in this pink shirt.
[00:39.16]I did mean the both of you.
[00:40.48]I wasn't singling you.
[00:41.58]Particularly, I was being mega-stylish.
[00:43.50]I mean, the duo, you know, you sat there, you're relaxed, you're ready for some pub in section, ready to give the audience some entertainment.
[00:53.51]That's what you're born for.
[00:55.40]Ready for some Cabba pride.
[00:56.68]Ready for some banter.
[00:57.96]Yeah, ready for some, you know, bromance right here, you know?
[01:00.38]Absolutely.
[01:01.06]Steve Lin.
[01:01.72]Halfway to sit between two of my favorite Europeans.
[01:03.81]It's been 12 months since I've last seen you, you know?
[01:06.09]It's been a long time.
[01:07.61]Far too long.
[01:08.35]Too long.
[01:09.09]Too long.
[01:09.85]We got some fun friends over there playing pubs.
[01:12.11]We certainly do have some fun friends over there.
[01:13.80]Let's take a look at who we've got.
[01:15.10]We've got Mailer, RaiseFire, Lang, and Jerma.
[01:20.40]Hi.
[01:21.22]Hello.
[01:21.62]Hello.
[01:22.06]Hey.
[01:22.66]Well, hi there.
[01:23.98]Jerma's got his fruit there as well.
[01:26.77]Yeah.
[01:27.97]It has to be within eight feet of me.
[01:30.15]Apples I see over there.
[01:31.70]Yeah, two apples.
[01:33.14]Very specific.
[01:34.00]I think I see the yellow flash of a banana over there as well, somewhere in the middle.
[01:37.67]We've got it.
[01:38.79]There it is.
[01:39.97]I think that's ready and waiting for Tag.
[01:43.22]It's got his name written on it.
[01:46.54]We've also got some bananas on the desk as well in the mugs.
[01:49.67]Maybe we'll see an appearance in this segment as well.
[01:55.10]But I said I would eat a banana at 100k.
[01:57.35]You did, but I don't think we have to do that.
[02:00.35]Do you not want to?
[02:02.99]I'm 100% sure that we do because Jerma's sponsors, they would require it.
[02:08.46]Jerma's sponsors.
[02:09.64]The fact that he is here means that everybody else has to partake in it as well.
[02:14.41]I thought Slim B was banned from Twitch.
[02:17.63]I don't know.
[02:22.48]Shout out to Twitch, our sponsor, for kind of a sweet deal.
[02:28.32]So you heard it here, guys.
[02:29.91]If we get to 100k in this segment with Slin on the camera, he's going to, I believe the word was, inhale a banana.
[02:36.63]You used that word.
[02:37.75]You used that word.
[02:39.50]I'll do it if Jerma does it with me.
[02:41.80]Would you also eat a banana on stream?
[02:43.22]The same banana.
[02:44.22]Eat a banana on stream?
[02:46.06]yeah lady in the trampoline I I will watch somebody eat a banana on stream I'm not a food on stream eater oh you're not a food on stream eater unless it's a lesson you know it is a fruit like a berry or something I'll eat one cherry can we get can we get a blueberry over here for Jeremy he is trashed he just traveled in today oh I just lost he could use a single berry yeah one one one cherry a tiny one the one you know the jars
[03:11.26]You have to unscrew the jar and take out the one cherry.
[03:12.78]Can we get a maraschino cherry for Jeremy?
[03:15.83]The thing that's on the sundae.
[03:18.15]We'll just get someone to do a giant food run at the end and pick up all of these really niche requirements for you.
[03:25.15]I require only red and purple M&Ms.
[03:27.95]Yeah.
[03:28.85]I've got to get this guy.
[03:32.24]Let me get this guy too.
[03:34.60]What was it like getting out here, by the way?
[03:36.74]Did you teleport here?
[03:39.16]Well, it's a weird device.
[03:41.35]All of my bones turned into like a jello substance.
[03:46.33]Is it cherry-flavored jello?
[03:48.04]No, it's person.
[03:49.24]It's gross.
[03:49.86]Person-flavored jello?
[03:51.00]Well, that doesn't sound good at all.
[03:52.18]So someone brought you over in like a Tupperware.
[03:56.99]And then you like reformed when you got here.
[04:01.09]You just put them in the fridge for a couple of hours.
[04:02.83]You just stick me in the fridge.
[04:05.02]After like four hours, I'll be fine.
[04:06.62]I'm imagining like Flubber, like my favorite Disney princess Flubber.
[04:12.45]Did you say Disney princess?
[04:14.71]Flubber is my favorite Disney princess.
[04:17.69]She's underappreciated.
[04:19.07]Flubber.
[04:19.68]I'm sorry.
[04:20.44]I must have missed a connection there in some way.
[04:22.82]In what way is Flubber a Disney princess?
[04:25.12]It's a Disney movie, I'm very sure.
[04:27.35]Is it?
[04:27.85]Flubber wears a little tiara as well.
[04:29.03]Is it a Disney movie?
[04:29.77]Yes.
[04:30.86]Wow.
[04:31.40]Well, I didn't realize she was a princess.
[04:34.13]Okay.
[04:34.63]There you go.
[04:37.65]We teach people things.
[04:41.86]But the focus of the entirety of this event, obviously, is raising donations for One Step Camp.
[04:47.60]I'm going to read out a few now because we've got a few that came in in that previous segment that didn't quite get read out.
[04:53.20]So we've got a donation here from MechaTheTekka for $7.93.
[04:57.91]He says, it's not a lot, but I wanted to contribute something extra, much like last year.
[05:02.99]Yesterday and today have been great, and I do hope you reach your goal.
[05:06.02]Keep up the great work, everyone.
[05:08.14]And he's got a little smiley face at the end.
[05:09.82]Can we see a smiley face?
[05:10.94]Hello, smiley faces.
[05:12.18]He's admirable with his best smiley face.
[05:14.20]Where's your smiley face, Slim?
[05:16.89]I like the, actually smiley face is one of my favorite sub emotes on Twitch.
[05:21.22]Just smiley face?
[05:22.16]Yeah, yeah.
[05:23.10]Everyone is subbed to the smiley face.
[05:24.81]Like the robot smiley.
[05:26.11]Ah, yes.
[05:26.59]Robot smiley subs.
[05:27.51]It's a good one.
[05:28.72]Of course, someone bound to throw a pirate in there, like randomly.
[05:31.68]Ah, yes.
[05:32.06]Some dude.
[05:35.20]We've got $100 as well from Christian Nunez.
[05:39.47]He says, I'm happy to be part of a community that can make the efforts to create events for such a noble cause.
[05:45.04]This is my first time ever donating for charity, and even at a time for me when I've been without a job for over a month, I'm sick with ulcerative colitis.
[05:51.61]I'm willing to help regardless.
[05:53.13]Much love to the Toth team and supporters.
[05:55.26]Little love hard there.
[05:57.42]Thanks, Christian.
[05:59.28]$100.
[06:01.55]Very good.
[06:02.15]Very generous.
[06:02.93]And for such a good cause, too.
[06:05.28]It is.
[06:05.96]Use the word noble.
[06:08.04]It is a lovely cause.
[06:09.64]We are just under 3,000 away from that huge 100,000 landmark.
[06:16.46]It's...
[06:17.95]It's a milestone.
[06:19.11]It definitely is.
[06:20.17]It's an important one.
[06:21.01]I think it's pretty possible that we could hit it during this segment as well.
[06:25.46]It is.
[06:25.62]It's possible.
[06:26.30]I do notice there's a cardboard box here next to us.
[06:29.20]What's this?
[06:30.10]Has anyone else noticed this thing here?
[06:32.01]That's like the Metal Gear Solid thing.
[06:34.63]They get the exclamation mark on their head.
[06:38.35]What?
[06:38.43]How did that thing get here?
[06:41.64]I have no idea.
[06:42.84]I think possibly Jello.
[06:45.86]It also formed into a Jello.
[06:48.95]Is that the box that Jeremy came in?
[06:50.25]I came in that box.
[06:53.63]Well, that has multiple meanings, I guess.
[06:59.18]Thanks, Steven.
[06:59.92]I arrived in that box.
[07:02.78]The it's almost exactly the right size for the balloon icon as well I think at some point the balloon icon has got to make some kind of
[07:12.05]trip into the box.
[07:13.07]Please don't turn the Balloonicorn into Jello.
[07:14.59]I don't know if I can handle that.
[07:16.97]That's a required part of the process.
[07:18.73]We might never get back.
[07:19.74]I hope going into the box doesn't involve turning into Jello, because I have to do that.
[07:23.78]I mean, we have the photos from when you were trying to get in there earlier, and it seems like it might have been what you went through.
[07:28.44]Yeah.
[07:29.04]There are armholes, but I cannot figure out the best place to cut these into boxes, and your arms do actually have to turn into Jello in order to get in and out.
[07:38.93]Can't wait to see that on stream.
[07:40.87]Have you actually confirmed that with your arms through those holes that you can get your arms close enough together to grip a controller?
[07:46.34]I can.
[07:46.90]Yep.
[07:47.30]Okay.
[07:47.78]I tried that out.
[07:48.68]Alright.
[07:49.22]I can.
[07:49.78]Field tested.
[07:51.10]It's possible.
[07:52.08]It's possible.
[07:52.48]It works.
[07:53.45]Hello there.
[07:55.13]Just randomly on the side.
[07:56.23]Hello, window.
[07:57.33]Hello.
[07:58.05]Hello, door.
[08:00.63]Do not door give away later on.
[08:02.76]Oh.
[08:03.48]Oh, really?
[08:04.48]Nope.
[08:04.84]That's not true.
[08:09.66]Oh, man.
[08:11.20]But we do have some pubbing going on at the moment as well.
[08:13.34]This is one of my favorite maps, by the way, Upward.
[08:15.64]It's got so much replayability.
[08:17.55]I used to love playing Pyro on it just because you could push people off the edges.
[08:21.07]Then I realized that I'm terrible and the class Pyro isn't that powerful.
[08:27.65]You ever see people do those soldier jumps that just launch them halfway across the map?
[08:32.96]I've tried doing that so many times.
[08:34.08]I'm so bad at it.
[08:35.10]We had a pub segment yesterday on Upward, actually, and we were talking.
[08:38.65]Yeah, I think so.
[08:41.63]And he was just flying around this map.
[08:43.86]Just somehow all of the ramps and hills seem to be perfectly...
[08:48.84]for flying around and doing ridiculous jumps.
[08:53.23]I don't think we'll get that here.
[08:54.93]We don't have Tag, our local expert jumper on the scene.
[08:59.06]Maybe Melee can show us a few.
[09:00.86]No.
[09:01.50]Or George.
[09:03.12]Maybe George.
[09:04.31]Get George back over here.
[09:05.27]Maybe he can show us some cool moves.
[09:09.03]I thought those jumps were your bread and butter, Saito, from many, many seasons competing at the top of European roaming.
[09:14.85]Yeah, I think I single-handedly dragged down the top of European roaming.
[09:19.58]Well, some people say that Soldier is your main class, but is that true, or is it more like Spy?
[09:24.79]It is more like Spy, yeah.
[09:27.33]We're just taking a look at that window every now and then.
[09:29.25]Oh, hello, Curtis.
[09:30.23]Taking a look at Truck Truck every now and then.
[09:33.12]Hey, come here.
[09:33.52]What are his key bindings?
[09:35.62]I don't know what I'm doing.
[09:36.42]What are his key bindings?
[09:40.77]I need an update, guys.
[09:42.17]I'm checking out your box.
[09:43.93]I see there's a jaunty pin in there.
[09:45.49]There is a jaunty pin.
[09:46.54]Are we all sold out of the jaunty pins?
[09:48.80]We are sold out of the jaunty pins, and we sold out ages ago, as far as I can remember.
[09:53.51]I think we may have even sold out yesterday.
[09:55.85]It was either at the very beginning of today or yesterday.
[09:58.37]Those got snapped up instantly.
[10:00.07]It was the end of yesterday.
[10:01.60]One day.
[10:02.74]One single day.
[10:04.06]So how can people donate to Tip of the Hats?
[10:06.56]That's what I want to know.
[10:07.84]Well, people can donate with monetary donations, of course.
[10:11.87]You can also donate with item donations.
[10:14.37]So you can go to tipofthehats.org and there's a little donate button at the top there.
[10:20.25]You get to choose whether you want to donate monetarily or with your TF2 items.
[10:24.58]And those can be things like keys, australiums, and also some kind of ticket as well.
[10:30.56]Is that like a... And today...
[10:32.62]If you donated yesterday, guys, with your items, and you were wondering, damn, why can't I give in my unusual hat?
[10:39.03]Which is where a lot of people have... That's where they store their wealth, you know, the family heirlooms.
[10:44.48]If you want to give away your granny's unusual hat, you can now do that.
[10:48.76]And it's a very simple process.
[10:50.80]You head over to tipthats.org.
[10:53.23]And you get sent to scrap.tf.
[10:55.31]And it tells you which items in your backpack, once you've logged in with your Steam account,
[10:58.83]are actually viable to be turned directly into cash.
[11:02.52]That's a new feature we have this year.
[11:04.07]They'll tell you the price of that as well, so that you know exactly how much you're giving over to the charity.
[11:09.23]which is brilliant that we're able to actually do that and convert the items straight into the money.
[11:15.26]That money from the converted items also goes towards getting you a little bonus.
[11:20.17]You know, the in-game medals.
[11:22.03]The in-game medals.
[11:23.16]I wonder if we can take a look at somebody who's got one of those in-game medals on within the pub.
[11:27.85]I'm looking at Mela trying to get a chain stab here.
[11:30.66]No, don't look that.
[11:31.50]I like your technique, your left-right technique.
[11:34.12]Sorry, he was shot down by Frank Pizza.
[11:37.24]Good job, Frank.
[11:38.13]But there are three different tiers of those medals.
[11:39.95]So the first one is a bronze one.
[11:41.17]That's if you donate $10.
[11:42.95]And that's through items or through money as well.
[11:46.91]And the next level is $30, which gives you a silver in-game medal.
[11:52.26]And then you got your $100 big old gold one.
[11:55.68]Are you okay?
[11:57.55]Can I be alright?
[11:59.45]I'm about to freak.
[12:02.79]I just got... Poot.
[12:05.93]MailerMoreLikeFailer.
[12:08.31]I can't believe it.
[12:10.26]Is who we're currently spectating.
[12:12.32]Well, not anymore.
[12:13.12]I'm dead.
[12:13.66]I'm not alive.
[12:14.98]No, no.
[12:15.52]I mean, literally, there is a guy in the server called MailerMoreLikeFailer.
[12:19.67]Is that Shiloh?
[12:21.51]Are you Frank Pizza?
[12:23.37]Frank Pizza.
[12:24.69]Sounds good.
[12:26.78]Is that your alias when you check into hotels?
[12:30.29]Ah, yes.
[12:30.63]To all of the Frank Pizza, please.
[12:33.45]Forgot my tab.
[12:34.93]Is there anyone in this world whose last name is Pizza, do you think?
[12:38.46]There has to be.
[12:39.30]Yeah, the guy that made the first pizza.
[12:41.76]It was named after him.
[12:43.12]Frankie P. Gotta be, right?
[12:46.00]Why else would you name it Pizza?
[12:48.31]That's a great question.
[12:49.55]What is it?
[12:50.19]Is it short for something?
[12:51.55]They needed a word with two Zs in it.
[12:53.13]No, it wasn't short for anything.
[12:54.17]It was a guy's name.
[12:56.03]Yup.
[12:56.65]It was Frank.
[12:57.49]Frank Pizza.
[12:58.39]It was Frank Pizza.
[12:59.35]He was the first Pizza.
[13:00.96]You named yourself after the creator of Pizza.
[13:04.10]He is the creator of Pizza.
[13:05.50]It's a brilliant shout-out.
[13:08.13]How are you doing that raised fire?
[13:14.81]Oh, you know, you know, we're just we're cruising.
[13:17.13]I'm trying to get some DH action going here.
[13:19.92]Oh, I can put a teleporter down.
[13:21.40]I saw you struggling.
[13:23.85]Yeah, that's that's that pretty much sums up my experience with this game.
[13:27.43]Just struggling.
[13:28.47]It's just that weapon.
[13:29.39]You know, it's hit and miss.
[13:31.90]Mostly miss.
[13:33.58]Mostly.
[13:35.42]See, they call it the direct hit because the hits happen so rarely that when you actually do get one, you like freak out.
[13:41.44]So, Raze, I don't want to put you on the spot, but I do want to know, like, what is your favorite part about Team Fortress 2?
[13:47.65]Like, what is it that you like about this game in particular?
[13:52.54]Well, I have, like, 7,000 hours in this game, right?
[13:55.45]7,000 hours?
[13:56.61]Yeah, something like that.
[13:57.77]I know, right?
[13:58.41]You'd look and you'd think, what?
[13:59.26]That guy only has like seven hours.
[14:00.70]That's quite a few.
[14:01.74]It's quite a few.
[14:02.88]I think the reason that I enjoy this game so much is because of all the different movement options, you know?
[14:08.33]Each class, they have different ways to get around, different ways to go about doing things, and it keeps it fresh.
[14:14.41]Yeah, variety.
[14:15.75]Yeah, variety.
[14:16.57]Yeah, this game has a lot of variety, for sure.
[14:18.80]Teleport is in the absolute worst place it could ever be in.
[14:21.25]Just so you know, whenever you start a sentence with, I don't mean to put you on the spot, but... They say that nothing before the but matters.
[14:31.70]But who is they?
[14:32.53]That's the saying.
[14:34.37]The thing people say.
[14:35.23]It's like, I don't want to be a jerk, but... And then you immediately say something that makes you a jerk.
[14:39.88]Okay.
[14:40.76]Yeah, that's how it works.
[14:42.16]I don't want to put you on the spot, but I'm going to ask you a totally open-ended question.
[14:47.15]I feel like I'm interviewing for a job or something.
[14:49.62]What do you like about Team Fortress 2?
[14:52.82]Well, you'd think with 7,000 hours it wouldn't be too difficult to answer.
[14:57.09]You've got to like something about it.
[14:58.89]Is this something you've been thinking about?
[15:00.47]You set up late at night thinking, what is it that I like about Team Fortress 2?
[15:03.61]What is Tip of the Hat?
[15:04.73]Actually, I hit 10,000 hours in TF2 a month ago, and I texted my best friend, and he's like, I don't know anyone in the world who has 10,000 hours doing something.
[15:14.00]They say...
[15:15.15]Malcolm Gladwell.
[15:16.45]To attain mastery.
[15:17.47]Yeah.
[15:18.03]To attain mastery in something, you put 10,000 hours into it.
[15:21.29]Have you attained mastery?
[15:22.87]Outliers.
[15:24.09]Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers.
[15:25.35]Malcolm Gladwell.
[15:25.97]There you go.
[15:26.94]Have you attained mastery?
[15:27.94]Do you feel like you've reached the pinnacle of... Let's ask Twitch chat.
[15:31.46]I think they'll tell you guys.
[15:34.14]Let's ask Twitch chat.
[15:36.00]Did you get a degree in the post from Valve?
[15:38.41]Congratulations, you're a master in TF2.
[15:40.65]You know how they send YouTubers those little gold plaques?
[15:43.69]Yeah.
[15:43.89]One of those.
[15:44.93]I'm getting through some very interesting information as well, guys.
[15:49.04]We have a whole new load of those enamel pins.
[15:53.91]Say what?
[15:54.65]A whole new load of these enamel pins here.
[15:57.63]We got a load of it.
[15:58.91]Available now.
[16:00.02]for you guys to buy so we had completely sold out we were just talking about it earlier but we have a new batch of them and those are all made by jasper it's our resident artist for tip of the hats who made the emotes made the design for the shirts shirts as well
[16:19.83]I love that.
[16:21.23]And also made these pins as well, so you can see Admirable wearing one.
[16:24.94]We've got one on the box here as well.
[16:27.61]They might look a little bit small there, but they look brilliant as well.
[16:31.12]Brilliant.
[16:31.88]Pins and shirts.
[16:34.83]And we have 150, I believe, although they may have sold quite a few since then.
[16:45.82]So I take that with a pinch of salt, but those are 30 bucks as well.
[16:50.31]So we also have the shirts on Teespring as well.
[16:52.91]You can see the shirt design behind me and behind Admirable.
[16:55.94]None of us are wearing it at the moment, actually.
[16:57.68]We all opted for something different.
[16:59.76]We're trying to be hipsters.
[17:01.01]You're wearing your duck hunt shirt.
[17:02.85]Gettywheel marched me around the city last night in the hunt for fruit.
[17:05.50]I got a little sweaty, so I thought, yeah.
[17:07.76]Just to be nice to my couch people, I wouldn't wear the same shirt again.
[17:12.83]After day one, we decided, get it all decided, oh, yeah, let's all go for a walk.
[17:17.02]Let's go hang out together.
[17:17.94]TF2 friends.
[17:19.05]We'll get some fro-yo.
[17:20.85]And we ended up walking around the city.
[17:22.51]It was humid and raining.
[17:24.22]Yeah, it was.
[17:24.76]And we didn't even find any.
[17:26.20]It was a man's man, though.
[17:26.78]We walked around for an hour.
[17:27.92]I don't need satellite navigation.
[17:29.63]GPS isn't for me.
[17:30.55]I'm on an adventure.
[17:31.81]Yeah.
[17:31.95]He just storms off down the street.
[17:33.73]Everything was closed.
[17:34.63]I was a bit tired, and I was at the front, and I think he thought that I was upset with him, that he'd taken us on a wild goose chase.
[17:42.04]He came up next to me, and he said, are you alright?
[17:44.11]Are you okay?
[17:44.91]You're not mad that we're lost?
[17:46.99]And I was like, no, no, I'm just tired.
[17:48.55]I'm quite enjoying the walk.
[17:49.45]And he was like, yeah, I enjoy walks.
[17:52.06]I enjoy the feeling of being a bit lost.
[17:55.16]I enjoy just discovering a city, just exploring.
[17:58.14]I think it's his first time in Chicago.
[18:00.98]Yeah, maybe his first time in this area of Chicago because last year he didn't get the chance to explore and go around.
[18:08.75]But anyway, back to the enamel pins.
[18:10.77]If you want those, that is tipofthehats.bigcartel.com.
[18:15.52]And you can place an order there for...
[18:19.20]I don't know, as many as you want.
[18:20.80]I would get them fast because all the pins yesterday sold out in one day.
[18:25.63]Yeah, they went super fast.
[18:27.67]If you wanted one and you weren't able to get them or if they just sound really interesting and you want to get your hands on some real-life Tip of the Hats 2016 merch, then you should definitely head on over there because those are very likely to disappear almost instantly.
[18:43.09]I mean, you could probably order five.
[18:45.16]Easily, you know, one for each ear, each nipple, one for your shirt as well.
[18:49.94]You'd be good to go, yeah, you know.
[18:51.61]I think five, standard order.
[18:53.49]Please do not do that.
[18:55.57]There's something else I think we should plug too.
[18:56.88]If you guys look at the top left of the screen, you'll see a hashtag TOTH2016.
[19:01.84]If you don't use Twitter, not a big deal, but head over there and just check out all the pictures and videos that we've been posting for this event.
[19:08.54]Because whether or not you're here participating, it's just fun to look at the pictures and go, oh, my God.
[19:13.40]And there's some behind-the-scenes stuff that's actually really cool.
[19:15.97]It is, yeah.
[19:17.21]We've been...
[19:18.60]Just posting things.
[19:19.56]The individual people have been posting stuff, but also the official Tip of the Hats Twitter have been posting little pictures and videos and stuff like that.
[19:27.49]Sideshow with your GoPro on.
[19:29.42]That was a funny one.
[19:30.16]And Crocodile, did you see the one with his with the GoPro where his hair is cut in half?
[19:34.06]Yeah, his hair is separated as well.
[19:34.89]I think it's hilarious.
[19:35.49]Yeah, it's fantastic.
[19:37.33]So you can check out that.
[19:39.39]And, of course, if you've got any tweets that you want to make about Tip of the Hats, then do use that hashtag, which is up in the top left.
[19:45.12]That's T-O-T-H 2016.
[19:48.07]There we go.
[19:48.39]Somewhere around there.
[19:49.69]Somewhere.
[19:50.31]Yep, you got it.
[19:51.45]And that's the shirt design as well that you couldn't see before, but that is up on Teespring.
[19:55.09]So you can check that out as well, and you can buy those shirts.
[19:57.86]This shirt's the one from last year, right?
[19:59.16]Cancer Sucks?
[20:01.70]That one, I believe, was the shirt from last year, right?
[20:03.70]The gray one, yeah.
[20:05.01]The gray one, the official Tip of the Hands one.
[20:06.47]I think that's a proper one-step camp.
[20:08.77]rather than a tip of the hat shirt.
[20:12.30]Those two, both of those.
[20:13.30]I've seen that one before.
[20:14.04]Yeah, the I Love One Step Camp and the Cancer Stucks Hash One Step Camp, both the charities' T-shirts.
[20:21.73]And these are the ones with the designs.
[20:23.88]And the most recent one, the one that we're selling this year, was made by Jazz Butts, the same artist that's done these
[20:31.13]cute little enamel pins.
[20:32.84]They're gorgeous looking.
[20:34.14]They look really good.
[20:35.13]Yeah, I like them.
[20:36.17]Since when does the Quickie Bomb launcher only have four stickies?
[20:40.25]What does that mean?
[20:43.18]What was it?
[20:44.12]Talk to me.
[20:45.30]It used to have six, I think.
[20:46.66]Right, right, right.
[20:47.44]But is that it?
[20:48.59]You have four?
[20:49.49]Yeah, I think so.
[20:50.33]I mean, I don't think yours is bugged or something.
[20:52.37]You can only load it up to four.
[20:55.54]We put a special mod on this one.
[20:57.06]You heard him.
[20:57.42]Times 10.
[20:58.00]Welcome to .5.
[20:58.68].66 recurring stickies.
[21:04.65]I love this map.
[21:07.84]I love Borneo.
[21:09.42]What do you love about it?
[21:10.10]It's one of my favorite maps.
[21:12.09]What do you love about it, Jermo?
[21:14.99]I like this little barn in the beginning.
[21:17.27]I'm going to go hang out there with you.
[21:20.96]What are you playing at?
[21:21.92]Are you Frank Pizza?
[21:22.56]Let's go to freaky stuff in the barn.
[21:24.24]Frank's got a lunchbox.
[21:27.47]You know they had those contracts back when they did those contracts where you had to get like five kills with a level three sentry gun, and I tried to do it on Borneo.
[21:34.24]I set up my Rescue Ranger and my wrangler, and it is so hard to do that one.
[21:39.32]Yeah, I spent a lot of time on this map when those first contracts came out.
[21:44.37]Yeah.
[21:45.11]And there's some good memes on this map, too, where they're like, how to get on top of the shack.
[21:49.00]Have you seen those on Reddit?
[21:50.02]No.
[21:50.78]That's a pretty good meme.
[21:54.06]This guy was doing a very complicated set of jumps to get on top of the shack.
[21:58.11]That sounds like a top-tier meme.
[22:01.15]It's a Reddit meme.
[22:02.90]Is that, like, different from a normal meme?
[22:06.30]I don't know the distinction.
[22:07.54]It's just a tier.
[22:08.43]Sounds like an episodic meme.
[22:09.49]It's a tier of meme.
[22:11.43]So would you say it's a top tier, or would you say it's closer to the... Yeah, I think it goes, like, D, C, B, A, S tier, and then Reddit.
[22:18.78]Just right at the top.
[22:20.97]Reddit meme.
[22:22.96]They're good.
[22:23.86]They're good.
[22:24.34]They're pretty good.
[22:24.98]Can you give me an example?
[22:26.88]Well, Slen just gave you an example.
[22:28.73]Oh, that's true.
[22:30.51]Don't get greedy.
[22:31.19]This is our top tier of memes.
[22:33.49]We can only pull one out every now and then.
[22:35.43]You can't spin them all in one place.
[22:38.98]Oh, spy.
[22:39.92]Actually, you can because they were talking about Borneo for like a month.
[22:44.56]Dang it, Frank Pizza.
[22:47.30]Pretty aware.
[22:48.81]Got the game sense.
[22:50.69]The game sense.
[22:53.07]I say that in my century goes down.
[22:54.93]I could have protected it, but I didn't.
[22:57.37]I kind of would like to check out the names that are in the pub server if we can.
[23:01.89]Because I want to see who has the coolest name.
[23:04.40]You can scroll through different names here.
[23:06.30]Do you like names?
[23:07.26]I love checking out the coolest name in a pub server.
[23:09.94]Mainlet's got no points as well.
[23:11.72]That's what I see.
[23:14.36]Gachigasm is a classic.
[23:16.37]He used it all up in the old T2.
[23:18.47]Lathering up Jerma.
[23:20.27]Can we go tonight?
[23:21.01]What's his full name?
[23:21.59]What's his full name?
[23:24.81]I think that's it.
[23:25.73]Just lathering up Jerma.
[23:27.43]Hashtag.
[23:28.21]Yeah, he's not using the correct hashtag there.
[23:31.58]Can we kick this guy from the server?
[23:34.30]Nine out of ten.
[23:35.30]Top 2016.
[23:36.10]Top 2016.
[23:36.76]Getting the year wrong in 2016.
[23:40.03]I do that sometimes, though.
[23:44.92]I really do.
[23:46.10]How many of you guys are writing out a check and you're writing, like, 2014 on this thing?
[23:52.05]I do that all the time.
[23:52.95]You're two years behind.
[23:54.39]Yeah, I'm just like, oh yeah, like July, I can get July.
[23:57.29]I know that's six.
[23:58.70]You know, my mom's been doing that lately because she just recently retired.
[24:01.48]And she's like, oh, oh, today is a Wednesday.
[24:04.35]Oh, that's so nice.
[24:05.19]You have to go to work.
[24:06.13]You have to go to work and I don't.
[24:07.33]And I'm like, thanks for rubbing it in, mom.
[24:10.44]Mom jokes.
[24:11.18]By the way, July's not six.
[24:13.08]Oh, yeah.
[24:15.48]I apparently have problems with months, too.
[24:18.71]What is six?
[24:20.29]What is six?
[24:21.68]What is six?
[24:22.18]What am I doing?
[24:22.90]I'm like just walking.
[24:24.66]I turned to you to talk to you.
[24:26.08]I can hear you through here.
[24:27.59]That was a pretty risky play.
[24:28.85]I'm going to be honest.
[24:29.93]Yeah.
[24:30.21]Run at the team with a sentry in your hand.
[24:33.24]If you run that one a hundred times, I'm not sure how many times you'd have success with it.
[24:37.52]Zero.
[24:39.14]Maybe once, maybe once.
[24:40.41]But imagine the payoff if you got it up.
[24:42.43]Nobody shot your gun.
[24:43.28]Yeah, okay, here we go.
[24:45.40]Christmas would come early.
[24:47.37]No, I was going to say Merry Christmas.
[24:48.98]I was going to say it.
[24:51.68]lathering up Jerma I'm just trying to think of the meaning of that but that's just well I know but I don't think I should tell you just picture it I'm not sure that's all you gotta do there's not many ways you can use the verb lathering that's designed he could be washing his hands or he could he could washing his clothes washing Jerma's hands for him you could love it you could be washing my hand
[25:12.72]Can you lather someone with praise?
[25:14.77]Get them all nice and bright.
[25:16.75]Oh, Jerva, you're so awesome.
[25:17.53]We love you, Jerva.
[25:18.09]You're so great.
[25:19.62]And he's just out there getting more and more bubbly.
[25:21.34]Oh, boy.
[25:22.04]You're going to get hit by this guy.
[25:24.80]Oh, the melee V. melee fight.
[25:26.87]But Raze has got the heals.
[25:27.91]No, he's got the heals.
[25:28.65]Oh, no.
[25:30.19]It popped over.
[25:31.12]It was scaring me.
[25:32.96]Yeah, this is my first time in the United States as well, so I was... Really?
[25:36.40]Yeah, so when people have been taking me on tour, I say tour in the loosest sense of the word, around Chicago, like Mike was yesterday.
[25:46.44]He called it a jaunty walk or something.
[25:48.86]Yeah, a jaunty walk.
[25:50.46]So it certainly was.
[25:52.31]It was something like that anyway.
[25:54.31]But yeah, it's nice.
[25:55.63]I'm always amazed at how... Right, that was awful.
[25:57.91]Fruit, Fruit, who is bad.
[25:59.12]Oh, did you see that, Sam?
[26:03.55]I take it all back.
[26:04.31]It started out bad, but it ended amazing.
[26:06.29]I think he was baiting them into looking towards him so he could go for the double face.
[26:10.18]But he jumped over that guy's head.
[26:12.12]He's just amazing.
[26:14.08]There's nothing you can do against him.
[26:16.36]That's what Jerm is scared of.
[26:17.55]That's why he can't go.
[26:19.09]That's why he gets flattered up.
[26:20.79]I wish the medic could heal the building that I was holding.
[26:24.83]You know what I mean?
[26:25.27]Put the beam on me, but put the beam on the building.
[26:27.36]You know what I mean?
[26:28.32]What are they going to add, like a Medi Gun that heals buildings?
[26:31.75]Would it only heal buildings?
[26:33.07]It would only heal buildings.
[26:34.73]That's a niche Medi Gun.
[26:36.96]It would only heal buildings and it would heal them at like one HP a second.
[26:45.53]We'll get in touch with Valve immediately and tell them to add that one into the game.
[26:49.83]Here comes Fruit again with an incredible play.
[26:52.06]He's baiting people into thinking he's bad and then comes out with the magic.
[26:56.94]I'm going to play the weapons guy.
[27:00.64]Still bacon.
[27:02.52]So, Sideshow, you said this was your first time in the United States, right?
[27:05.85]When we went to get pancakes earlier, that was the first time you've ever had an American pancake, right?
[27:12.93]He didn't know how to eat them.
[27:14.06]He didn't know what to do.
[27:15.34]He picked up the pancakes with his hands.
[27:18.22]He just picked up the pancakes.
[27:20.30]And he put bacon on it.
[27:22.21]Lathered it in butter, and then he picked it up with his hands.
[27:25.39]It's like a bacon on top of it.
[27:28.79]If you have a French crepe, you eat them with your hands.
[27:32.42]Well, I mean, sometimes people chop them up.
[27:34.92]Yeah, you certainly don't stack them.
[27:36.59]So you didn't try to put syrup on your... Yeah, I did.
[27:39.37]You put the syrup there, and then you're all like... I spilled syrup all over the table.
[27:42.67]yeah before he even had his food served to me this is like examining the syrup and spill the big pool you know people think I put it on sometimes not the syrup think you uh lather yourself you guys are the latter right now that's I've heard that's like this there's six words that have been said one of them
[28:07.63]Brood, who is bad at getting these face stabs again?
[28:09.92]Yeah, I think he just knows exactly how to get the angles, you know.
[28:13.62]What I was going to say is we used to do these things called suicides where you take all the different kinds of syrup.
[28:17.29]You got like blueberry and strawberry syrup and you just maple and you just dump them on your pancake.
[28:22.13]There's multiple kinds of syrup?
[28:23.49]Yeah.
[28:23.61]Oh, run laps.
[28:24.03]Yeah.
[28:25.04]Probably laps.
[28:26.54]Yeah, suicides.
[28:27.50]Oh.
[28:28.12]Yeah.
[28:28.48]It was certainly... What?
[28:31.54]The spy plays are blowing my mind here.
[28:35.14]That was a repeat of what I did to 404 in the grand finals that one time.
[28:39.68]Shout out to 404 against Destroyed.
[28:41.32]There's a reference for all of the people who have a photographic memory of every spy play that Mail has ever done in the ESEA finals.
[28:49.55]That's a large group of people there.
[28:51.86]I think the only people are in the room.
[28:53.72]I appreciated it.
[28:59.10]Did you?
[28:59.36]Because I just attended like I did.
[29:07.71]We saw Stabby Stabby playing earlier as well.
[29:10.17]Yeah.
[29:10.81]Taught Mailer everything he knows on Spy.
[29:12.75]I love that guy.
[29:14.96]He still streams.
[29:16.44]He does.
[29:16.82]Reminds me of a certain other person who did like a farewell stream and then still streams.
[29:21.56]He would do that.
[29:21.93]Who was that?
[29:24.33]Yeah, no idea.
[29:25.25]He streams from a boat.
[29:26.59]I stream from a shed.
[29:27.55]You stream from like a box.
[29:28.77]He would milk their hands for every penny with a farewell stream.
[29:31.82]He would come back to stream again.
[29:34.10]I had to get confirmation on that, too.
[29:35.70]I thought he was using a green screen background, and he's like, no, man, it's just a shed.
[29:40.53]It's just a shed.
[29:41.31]It's not a shed.
[29:43.09]It's a state-of-the-art deluxe beach hut.
[29:46.50]What I like is that you went the extra mile and lit it up with lights.
[29:49.28]Yeah, yeah.
[29:49.92]It just happens to be temporarily misplaced at the moment.
[29:53.02]It's not on a beach.
[29:54.49]It's in the back garden.
[29:56.33]You're going to move the shed.
[29:57.25]You're going to turn it into a jello.
[29:59.55]One day I'll live on the beach.
[30:01.83]Yeah, one day we'll turn it into jello and just transport it into Jemma's backyard.
[30:07.02]Yeah, I'm not sure whether when you transfer things into jello, you get to decide where they go, actually, because I don't think Jemma was supposed to end up here.
[30:16.13]Well, I was going to the grocery store.
[30:18.50]I wanted to get some snacks.
[30:20.02]What he didn't tell you was I was actually in the bathroom looking at the mirror going, Jerma985, Jerma985, Jerma985, and then he appeared.
[30:27.21]So it was you?
[30:27.97]Yeah.
[30:28.71]You're the one.
[30:34.60]I like the noise this thing makes.
[30:37.43]Makes a good sci-fi noise.
[30:39.95]What's that gun called?
[30:40.99]The sci-fi gun.
[30:43.34]The sci-fi gun.
[30:44.66]The sci-fi shooter.
[30:46.56]What is it called?
[30:47.44]The Shooting Star.
[30:49.36]It's like the same thing.
[30:50.39]You got the S's in there.
[30:52.41]You got the S's correct.
[30:53.71]It's got some letters in there.
[30:55.97]Shooting Star.
[30:57.48]There are so many items in this game.
[30:59.94]There really are.
[31:00.72]There's a lot of them.
[31:01.84]And Slim's allowed them all.
[31:07.63]That's like a running joke to me in Sideshow.
[31:10.81]Universal whitelist.
[31:12.15]Thank you, Steven.
[31:13.85]It's global.
[31:14.40]It's not quite universal.
[31:15.64]There's people playing in other solar systems.
[31:19.88]In other planets, in fact.
[31:21.59]Global doesn't even stretch to different planets.
[31:25.03]For those who don't follow the competitive scene, there were a ton of banned items in competitive play, and all the leagues opened up the whitelist, so there's more items allowed now
[31:35.85]like ever before it was like vanilla so uh... I want to give me a hard time about it but there are other people involved the decision for other you know that what uh... it's all slated if you just had a tendency
[31:54.92]People will look back in years to come and say, yes, this is what TF2 needed.
[31:58.41]I thought you were talking about time zones, because I'm like, yeah, Chicago's two hours ahead.
[32:01.52]It is a little ahead of my time.
[32:06.13]Sorry, I'll not use such colorful language in the future.
[32:08.84]I'll make sure to spell it out for you, man.
[32:11.48]I'm a little slow.
[32:12.73]We have new Bid Wars opening for Day 3 as well.
[32:18.03]So I'll read what those are, but these are the incentives, the challenges that you see at the bottom of your screen now.
[32:24.96]So we've got Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, which is the game with somebody trying to defuse the bomb and the other one's reading out the instructions and stuff.
[32:34.15]So our incentive for that, our goal that has to be met is a delay echo.
[32:38.78]which could make things rather more difficult.
[32:41.88]It screws up how you talk.
[32:43.47]It does.
[32:44.77]In fact, if it's a delay on the person so that the person speaking can hear it back, it's just impossible to talk.
[32:50.92]Yes, exactly.
[32:52.36]If you even have like a 200 millisecond delay on an echo that comes back to you, you just... You hear yourself.
[32:57.83]You just... Talk like that.
[33:00.94]It's really difficult.
[33:02.42]Another one is a pipe launcher jump race in the jump segment, which we've got coming up tomorrow.
[33:07.14]The jumping and surfing segments are always just...
[33:10.18]For my money, the most amazing parts of Tip of the Hats.
[33:12.69]They are just... It's therapeutic to watch them.
[33:16.39]Pipe jumping is hard, too.
[33:17.82]Pipe jumping.
[33:18.64]It is.
[33:19.66]Yeah, I mean, they don't roll in nice places.
[33:22.10]Maybe they'll use the Iron Bomber.
[33:23.58]That'd be cheating, I think.
[33:24.55]I think it would, yeah.
[33:26.07]We've also got a Pyro Hero in the pub segment.
[33:30.69]A what?
[33:31.30]Pyro Hero.
[33:32.66]Now, what is that?
[33:33.32]Now, I have seen around the place some Guitar Hero...
[33:39.55]controllers.
[33:40.83]Is that related in some way?
[33:42.33]I wonder.
[33:44.19]Who knows?
[33:45.73]Maybe some more information will come up on the bottom of the screen, perhaps.
[33:49.40]Or maybe not.
[33:50.42]And we'll get the juice later on.
[33:53.26]And then we also have an amazing extra little challenge, which is the Scout voice actor in the pub.
[34:01.71]And that one's already got $330.
[34:03.33]We just opened it a few moments ago.
[34:05.50]So I think that one's certainly going to be a popular one.
[34:08.64]so Nathan the guy who does the scout voice acting who streams on Twitch yes yes you do every now and then but he doesn't do the scout voice very often I think it hurts his throat or something from the few times I've well speaking of Reddit all of his clips are on there on Reddit because it's extremely popular having him read out different voice lines I'm confused I thought uh curtis russ was the voice of this guy I am the scout give us your best scout structure
[34:35.05]No.
[34:36.15]That's the no command.
[34:39.19]Oh, that was good.
[34:39.93]That was good.
[34:40.98]You're welcome.
[34:42.32]Can we get another command?
[34:44.96]Yeah.
[34:47.16]That's the yes command.
[34:50.33]I like it.
[34:50.71]You're really good.
[34:51.67]Thank you.
[34:52.13]You're really good at this.
[34:53.21]That's the scout, who is also me.
[34:56.24]We also have another giveaway going on, and that is scrap.tf slash toth giveaway.
[35:04.70]And so there is a giveaway happening right now, just a new one that has opened up, so you guys can head on over there.
[35:09.70]There's the URL.
[35:11.25]You just plug that one into your browser of choice or your Steam browser or anywhere.
[35:16.51]Just write it anywhere you like.
[35:18.76]Scribble it down on the wall.
[35:20.36]And you'll eventually get taken there.
[35:23.24]No, you won't.
[35:24.66]You'll have to put it in a browser.
[35:26.51]You actually will.
[35:28.27]And you need to go over there if you want to join in on that giveaway.
[35:34.47]So lots of new stuff just thrown right at you there.
[35:38.24]But all of the information on the screen.
[35:40.36]And we're really close to this, 100k as well.
[35:42.50]So as the donations come in for these challenges,
[35:45.05]Already at $380 for that one as well.
[35:47.71]We are really fast approaching that 100K milestone.
[35:51.04]Yeah, I was going to ask, what are we at right now?
[35:53.47]How close are we to that 100K?
[35:55.63]98,261 votes.
[35:57.95]Let's get it done, boys.
[35:59.76]That is pretty close.
[36:00.90]And we've got a $300 donation from Archangel Architect who says, Road to 100K, we do it.
[36:08.01]Hashtag go bananas.
[36:09.65]Hashtag lather up Jerma.
[36:12.54]Speaking of Jerma, we need to get him that Dr. Pepper.
[36:15.07]We do.
[36:16.35]We need to send someone on to that.
[36:18.83]Slint?
[36:19.55]I'm not going to get away.
[36:20.53]He knows the city like the back of his hand.
[36:21.92]He's probably like a vending machine right over here somewhere.
[36:25.15]He certainly does.
[36:26.57]And don't forget our unwritten objective or our incentive.
[36:30.84]Mr. Slint will be a banana.
[36:32.34]Yes.
[36:32.97]At 100,000.
[36:33.35]And Jerma said he would watch.
[36:35.99]I will watch intently.
[36:38.06]I think there's going to be thousands of people watching, hopefully.
[36:40.60]Just my mom.
[36:43.50]We're just going to go over there and do it.
[36:46.51]I'm just going to watch you do it.
[36:48.51]Just me and you.
[36:49.29]I'll say your name three times in the mirror in the bathroom.
[36:51.20]You'll be there.
[36:52.18]Then we'll both walk out and I'll be like, hey, he did it.
[36:55.20]A couple more $100 donations as well.
[36:56.97]One from Zangoose who says, can we have a donation incentive to put a hat on each head of every kid at the camp?
[37:03.63]No.
[37:04.75]Unfortunately not.
[37:06.54]That is not a donation incentive.
[37:08.18]But we do have some other awesome ones and of course all of the money that is being raised here does go to the guys at the charity One Step Camp and does a lot nicer things for the kids than putting hats on their heads, I think.
[37:22.82]I think it's safe to say having a hat on your head is pretty good.
[37:25.84]I think hats are a really positive thing in your life.
[37:28.41]yeah yes everyone knows that hats can make video games significantly better this is a hat based game that we're watching right now it is another hundred dollars from Aaron carter who says look what you guys are doing thank you Aaron carter who knows hey Aaron carter I think we should big fan of your work Aaron I think there's only one Aaron carter ever ever that's him thank you Aaron carter
[37:55.20]And another $100 from Matthew Travers, who says, Hello, Tip of the Hats crew.
[38:01.66]Thank you for putting on this show.
[38:03.30]I wanted to contribute, seeing as most people, if not everyone, are affected in their lives by this disease.
[38:08.81]Been living off baked beans from my student allowance for the past few months to donate.
[38:12.71]I know that feel.
[38:14.62]P.S.
[38:15.16]When is my boy Tag going to eat those bananas, or have I missed that?
[38:18.63]Love from Scotland.
[38:19.97]Well, no, you haven't missed that.
[38:21.53]There's a banana sat right there, right in front of Mila.
[38:25.68]There you go.
[38:26.71]Raze has got it.
[38:27.55]And that has got Tag's name almost literally written on it.
[38:30.78]It's not at all, but it's designated for him.
[38:35.26]I was under strict orders to source many bananas today, you know, to just make sure that there's always a healthy supply of bananas around, in case Tag... We got some here.
[38:43.30]...feeds the urge, so... I think it's almost inevitable.
[38:47.70]You've got two then, don't you keep your bananas in coffee cups?
[38:50.43]Have you tried drinking a banana, Red Marble?
[38:53.77]You can show off the tip of the hat's mug at the same time as well.
[38:57.30]Oh, he got quite reach.
[39:02.08]that's up and on the street this is the life all the way down to a good place it's not the arena bananas can be done I'll try it and I don't know if we will be for the kids and I don't think it's really on that great you know there are I don't know why I think that's easy for you we're going to have a look at the procedure don't do it and it did
[39:28.88]Don't do it.
[39:30.12]I don't understand the obsession with bananas.
[39:31.54]It's so it's so mature.
[39:33.12]Yeah, I know who would who would do that I love all fruits equally man, you know, just so I What's your favorite fruit?
[39:40.51]I don't put you on the spot Favorite fruit in Twitch chat guys.
[39:46.72]Give us your favorite fruit Top three fruits in Twitch chat.
[39:51.38]You're asking for a lot here.
[39:53.08]Yeah sideshow I'm asking for a lot of fruit
[39:57.61]You're supposed to eat at least five a day.
[40:00.00]Are you really?
[40:00.86]You're just making up numbers.
[40:03.24]In the UK, the UK government has this thing where they say, like, five a day, eating five a day.
[40:07.83]And I only just realized that this is just utter nonsense.
[40:11.28]It's just a regional thing.
[40:13.14]I think France has something like you're supposed to eat ten portions of fruit and veg a day.
[40:18.37]Spain has something like eight, something like that.
[40:21.05]Well, it's a conspiracy, that's why.
[40:22.27]It's based on how much fruit your country produces.
[40:25.16]Possibly, but I think it's also because they know that most people from the UK would point blank refuse to eat ten pieces of fruit.
[40:33.55]So they had to downscale it to five to make it even reasonable.
[40:36.93]Chips is a fruit, right?
[40:38.11]Yeah, it is in Ulster.
[40:41.30]It certainly is.
[40:44.00]That counts as one of your portions of fruit and veg.
[40:46.24]I had three avocados this morning.
[40:49.00]So I had five different flavors of Skittle.
[40:52.60]It's kind of the same thing.
[40:53.70]That's pretty much the same thing.
[40:55.45]I had chocolate orange.
[40:56.71]You got Skittle?
[40:58.03]Not anymore.
[41:00.09]Really?
[41:00.79]I'll keep you in mind, though.
[41:02.03]Where were the green ones?
[41:04.43]Oh, I ate one of them.
[41:05.74]And one yellow one, and then a red one, and an orange one, and a purple one.
[41:11.04]Oh, you just named all the colors.
[41:15.04]I just had each of one.
[41:16.61]Yeah.
[41:17.31]I've got to eat your five.
[41:19.10]There's your five fruits.
[41:21.41]The five different colors.
[41:22.71]Speaking of fruits who are bad.
[41:24.38]We're watching him pick up health packs.
[41:29.79]See, that's what happens when you eat the fruit.
[41:31.58]It's like you get the health.
[41:35.00]Double kill.
[41:36.11]two and just slinks away oh not quite nearly a reminder as well guys that you can donate with your TF2 items and unusuals today uh as well as through monetary means so if you go to tip the hats.org donate button at the top you can choose whether you want to donate cash or items but if you're donating it towards one of
[41:59.00]Our incentives at the bottom, one of our challenges, like the Scout Voice Actor Pub that's currently at the bottom of the screen, those ones have to be cash donations there.
[42:07.93]So your Unusuals and your Australiums and things like that, you absolutely can donate them, and the proceeds will go to One Step Camp, the charity that we're supporting, but they won't fill the challenges at the bottom.
[42:22.23]So if you're interested in putting money towards them, then it has to be through cash in some way.
[42:32.31]So you're talking about the... I'm not sure what that was.
[42:34.71]You gotta stretch out every once in a while.
[42:36.13]Yeah.
[42:37.40]Scream was a little too stuffy.
[42:38.84]Maybe just do the YMCA.
[42:42.45]Those are not normal stretches.
[42:45.65]Two-man Mexican weave?
[42:48.62]What?
[42:50.28]Back the other way.
[42:54.77]Pretty good.
[42:55.75]Almost perfectly timed.
[42:57.05]Scraping the bottom of the content barrel here, guys.
[42:58.90]Don't do it!
[42:59.18]Don't hit me!
[43:01.77]I was transfixed by Big Mabla's Demoknight plays there.
[43:05.62]Yeah, who've we got?
[43:06.18]We've got FrankPizza here with the Loose Cannon.
[43:10.26]Watch this.
[43:11.46]How's the pooping going, Frank?
[43:12.70]It's going pretty well, as you'll see in about two secs.
[43:16.07]We are getting dangerously close to 100,000, I just want to say.
[43:19.05]We are.
[43:19.57]Every time I look in that corner of the screen, it's getting there.
[43:23.27]We are.
[43:23.77]We're sneaking up.
[43:24.72]I mean, if everybody watching currently donated $1, I actually don't know how many viewers we have, but I'm just going to make a wild guess that that would probably get us there.
[43:31.64]Or if you're just, you know, Cheeky Breaky.
[43:33.41]Cheeky Breaky.
[43:34.01]Cheeky Breaky.
[43:34.75]If your name is Cheeky Breaky.
[43:36.83]You know, it's the casual Mr. Blix 196.
[43:39.89]Yeah, $100.96.
[43:42.78]And you can see the little tracker in the bottom right-hand corner.
[43:46.54]When it's a gift wrap like that, that means that someone made an item donation.
[43:50.32]So that one was an item donation there for the $100.69.
[43:55.03]And when it has the little spinning pile of cold hard cash, dollar bills, that is...
[44:02.86]Those ones are the cash donations as well, and we appreciate whatever you're able to give, guys.
[44:08.01]Thank you very much for all of these donations that are coming in.
[44:12.51]Like this one, for $30 from Bell, who says, this event is the heart of the TF2 community.
[44:18.44]Love you all.
[44:19.87]I'll give you a heart back.
[44:20.65]Thank you.
[44:21.71]It does have a huge reach, this event, Tip of the Hat.
[44:25.31]It ties in all the different corners.
[44:27.14]It is kind of like the heart of the TF2 community.
[44:30.08]Yeah.
[44:30.16]think that's one of my favorite parts about this event is that we feature so many different kinds of TF2 later on today we're doing a surf segment we got a little bit of everything yeah um we've got our creators like we had uber chain and crocodile earlier on of course all the the hard work and effort that goes in like the beautiful stream assets we have here percy and support class every time we take a break in between the segments I just look at that
[44:54.65]Camp... I don't know what the name of that map is.
[44:57.45]Camp Redmond?
[44:58.07]Yeah.
[44:58.43]It's so cool.
[44:59.59]It's beautifully made, isn't it?
[45:01.04]Yeah.
[45:01.68]And if you missed that, Uberchain and KunkkaDoll were on earlier, just kind of running through the Source FM and how they'd made different segments that have been used in the stream and how they built different assets.
[45:12.79]So if you missed that one, definitely check out the VODs as well because...
[45:17.51]I don't know about you guys, but I don't really see very many opportunities to get that kind of insight into the behind-the-scenes stuff with SFM that often.
[45:25.86]You can see a lot of the other people are pretty active with producing that kind of behind-the-scenes content on how they make it, but this is one of my only opportunities to really get that side of TF2 and see how all the really cool posters and things are made.
[45:41.56]100%.
[45:42.83]It's crazy, too.
[45:43.99]You see them explain all this stuff, and for me personally, I still have no idea what's going on.
[45:48.23]They're like magicians.
[45:49.30]They just make that stuff happen.
[45:50.94]It's crazy to see.
[45:52.36]Yeah, I was watching it and thinking, could I use this as a tutorial of getting good at Source FM?
[45:58.37]I thought, I know so little about it that I wouldn't even be able to begin because Ubershain was explaining very articulately what she was doing, but she was just clicking buttons all over the place.
[46:09.00]Right, right.
[46:09.51]I had no idea what they corresponded to, and she was talking about masking people's shadow hands and unleashing the Matrix upon people, and I had not a clue.
[46:20.02]I look at it as a source of inspiration, something that I'll never be able to.
[46:23.75]Earlier we were doing the Ulta Duo segment, and I'm watching Mela hit
[46:26.65]mad air shots on tag, who is also an invite-roaming soldier, and it looks so easy.
[46:31.62]I thought you were going to say my medic play, and you were like, that's something I'll never be able to do.
[46:35.94]Yeah, me too.
[46:36.30]That was all out.
[46:37.10]Well, I play medic, so it wasn't that crazy.
[46:42.29]What did you just say?
[46:43.37]What?
[46:44.29]You want to go?
[46:45.05]Step outside, mate.
[46:46.15]I'll show you who the best medic is.
[46:47.31]Yeah, I'm going to hug it out.
[46:48.33]I'm going to give you a big hug.
[46:49.17]What are you going to do about that?
[46:51.14]I'm going to snap you like a twig.
[46:54.72]I'm kind of waiting for you to say, what am I doing?
[46:58.22]We had the hug of death earlier with the server, and now we've got the hug of death here.
[47:02.37]Mr. Slim, you were my hero last year.
[47:04.29]Really?
[47:05.13]Your run back in Dota Fortress.
[47:08.19]Because remember, there was this whole thing where it was like, Sterl was purposely not picking you, you know, just to troll you out a little bit.
[47:16.22]And then you got picked by Jerma, and you came back and you clutched it.
[47:19.50]Yeah, Jerma and I go way back.
[47:21.12]To last a year.
[47:23.49]Yeah, you might go way back to like 14 months ago.
[47:26.34]Childhood friends.
[47:28.69]Yeah, we grew up.
[47:30.11]I saw a dream at BlizzCon.
[47:31.84]That was fun.
[47:32.44]Yeah, it was a really good time.
[47:35.05]Well, speaking of Jerma, we've got a $10 donation here from Festive Possum who says, First year of being able to donate to Toth and so happy to do so.
[47:43.02]Lost a few family members to cancer and it's nice to see what the group is doing for those kids.
[47:47.91]Also, silly request, could Jerma say the berries thing please?
[47:53.02]Oh, I think I know what that is.
[47:55.44]That song.
[47:57.14]I'll just say it for you.
[47:59.63]I got to pick something up first.
[48:00.63]It's going to be good.
[48:02.15]It really isn't.
[48:04.66]Oh, look, a baby.
[48:05.24]That's it?
[48:06.50]That's it.
[48:07.10]Good.
[48:07.68]I liked it.
[48:08.56]That's it.
[48:08.92]That was good.
[48:09.52]Give us it again.
[48:10.16]Pretty good.
[48:11.50]Say it again.
[48:12.82]Say berries again.
[48:14.46]Berries, berries.
[48:15.86]Yeah.
[48:17.57]Berries, berries, berries.
[48:19.03]That was fun.
[48:20.13]That game was fun.
[48:21.17]Lots of things are fun, right?
[48:22.76]Yeah.
[48:23.14]What was that then?
[48:23.64]You have to give us the context for that for the rest of the people who didn't.
[48:27.22]That's how the video opens, with no context, actually.
[48:29.65]It's an H1Z1 video.
[48:32.15]We're like running around yelling at people about the berries because the berries are like the fruit that you ate.
[48:37.38]And that just, I was just being weird and I just started saying that word.
[48:40.73]The fruit sponsorship goes way back.
[48:42.29]Fruit sponsorship goes back further than most people know.
[48:46.34]You say that a lot, actually.
[48:47.97]You say that a couple times.
[48:49.39]Only today, you know?
[48:50.33]Like saying, I'm just a weird guy doing weird things.
[48:53.31]It's kind of what it is.
[48:54.44]Yeah?
[48:56.12]I mean, I grew up a weird guy.
[48:57.86]We're all pretty weird, you know?
[48:59.76]In our own little ways.
[49:01.61]Speak for yourselves.
[49:02.45]Speak for yourselves.
[49:04.31]Don't let me in with you guys.
[49:07.22]The weirdos.
[49:09.32]The weird group.
[49:10.34]I'm going to hide over here in my cardboard box and not be weird.
[49:14.81]I'm going to keep away from the weirdos inside my box.
[49:17.63]Get these weirdos away from me.
[49:19.78]Oh, $1,000 donation.
[49:23.00]Master Kunai.
[49:24.86]Is that going to put us over the edge here?
[49:27.13]Oh, not quite.
[49:28.09]I don't think so.
[49:29.17]You know, whether you're Master Kunai giving $1,000 or Swenny giving $0.05...
[49:33.36]We really do appreciate it all.
[49:34.96]We appreciate whatever you're able to give.
[49:36.94]But that $1,000 donation, oh boy, that brings us incredibly close to the 100K milestone.
[49:45.33]And I'm just going to read out some donations that we had just before that.
[49:48.72]There was a $30 donation from Thomas M who said, glad to be supporting a great cause through a great community.
[49:55.95]Keep up the amazing work, guys.
[49:57.45]Oh, it did.
[49:58.19]It did.
[49:58.65]It did tick us over.
[50:00.03]Yeah, baby.
[50:00.43]It did.
[50:01.01]We made it 100,000, guys.
[50:02.64]100K.
[50:04.60]And his donation from Master Kunai is at 100K.
[50:07.63]Hi.
[50:08.39]Love you guys.
[50:09.25]Here's to yet another great event.
[50:12.12]So fantastic stuff.
[50:14.68]We did it, boys.
[50:15.81]To everybody.
[50:16.53]Are we not done yet?
[50:17.27]Yeah.
[50:17.35]to everybody at home thank you so much for donating so far whether it be monetarily through items with the unusuals today as well just every little bit just giving your time yeah doubling your meme efforts in chat absolutely we really do appreciate it it's so amazing to have broken that hundred thousand dollars that's an enormous amount of money
[50:39.03]I'm talking to Jeff at the beginning here where we had him on the sofa and Langan Mailer and Getterwell were talking to him.
[50:45.54]He was saying how much the money means to them in terms of what they can do and how it helps them grow and develop as a charity.
[50:52.93]And he was talking about the building, the new facility that they're opening and how that's going to help them.
[50:57.94]And it's just amazing that we can have that kind of direct impact on them like that.
[51:02.70]It's really fantastic stuff.
[51:04.44]Very cool.
[51:05.43]And just to bring it back on a serious note as well, we had a $50 donation just before that from Charmi who said, I had cancer as a child twice, leukemia.
[51:15.98]I spent a good portion of my childhood in the hospital.
[51:18.93]I don't think people realize just how important fun activities help in getting through the day-to-day drudgery.
[51:25.06]Thank you, guys.
[51:26.42]Wow.
[51:27.22]That means a lot.
[51:27.72]Thank you.
[51:28.20]It really does, doesn't it?
[51:29.18]Thank you.
[51:29.62]And I can't think of a more fun activity than Team Fortress the Second.
[51:34.53]Team Fortress the Second.
[51:35.35]Maybe camp would be a comparable fun activity.
[51:40.62]But there we go, 100,000.
[51:42.34]And as you say, we're not done yet.
[51:45.00]This is only 10 to 6 for us, halfway through the second day, or maybe slightly more than halfway through the second day.
[51:51.45]How does the maths work?
[51:52.47]It's almost exactly really halfway through the whole event.
[51:55.13]The whole event, yeah.
[51:55.71]To be at $100,000 halfway through the main event is just fantastic stuff.
[52:01.96]Awesome.
[52:02.56]Awesome work, guys.
[52:03.30]Thank you so much to everybody at home there.
[52:05.89]We couldn't possibly do it without you guys.
[52:08.27]So thanks to everybody who's contributed so far.
[52:11.37]We've still got a little bit of the section of the pubs left.
[52:14.22]What are you guys doing now?
[52:16.10]Where have we moved?
[52:17.98]Band Blitz.
[52:19.07]Band Blitz.
[52:19.69]Band Blitz.
[52:20.87]Band Blitz.
[52:21.51]Band Blitz.
[52:22.87]I like this map because it has snow.
[52:24.54]People around where I'm from talk like that.
[52:26.46]No, that's not me.
[52:29.41]Manchester?
[52:31.25]Yeah, like a Manchester accent.
[52:32.91]Boston.
[52:34.16]That's where I lived for a while.
[52:35.26]The king of squirrels.
[52:37.91]He talks a little bit like that, you know.
[52:40.01]My uncle's from Boston.
[52:41.23]He says, I'm going to get some lobster chowder.
[52:44.98]That was a solid C minus.
[52:46.46]Okay.
[52:47.90]What would, like, an A plus be?
[52:51.95]I don't know.
[52:52.91]I don't know.
[52:53.35]I'd have to hear an A plus.
[52:54.35]Lobster chowder.
[52:59.38]That's all I got.
[52:59.94]Anybody else on that couch want to try?
[53:02.94]Not at all.
[53:06.59]We don't have enough insight.
[53:08.07]I don't know about you, Admirable, but I find it very difficult to differentiate North American accents.
[53:14.30]I can tell very extreme regions, but south compared to north, I understand.
[53:21.25]East, west, vaguely.
[53:23.27]Canadians versus Americans?
[53:24.81]No, I actually can't.
[53:26.02]No?
[53:26.40]No.
[53:27.60]I don't know.
[53:28.54]I just... In Boston, they do this thing with the... It's like a long A. It's like, ah.
[53:33.10]Ah.
[53:33.26]Yeah.
[53:36.31]Ah.
[53:36.45]Ah.
[53:36.55]So I visited my uncle one time, and I noticed that they have very large... In California, where I'm from, no one has a front yard or a back yard.
[53:44.29]I live in the city.
[53:44.85]There's nothing.
[53:45.70]But when I was in Boston, they had these very large yards.
[53:49.22]So I was saying to my uncle, like, wow, they have really large yards here.
[53:51.86]And he goes, we don't have yards.
[53:52.96]We have yards.
[53:54.14]Yards.
[53:55.28]Yards.
[53:55.71]We don't have yards.
[53:56.83]Yards.
[53:56.93]We have yards.
[53:58.47]Yards.
[54:00.68]Yeah.
[54:01.68]We got a $30 donation.
[54:02.96]I do like my yard.
[54:03.98]From Donnie Green, who says, huge thanks for Tim of the Hands for hosting this Amazeballs event.
[54:10.56]Amazeballs, Slim.
[54:11.64]Amazeballs.
[54:13.01]Amaze what?
[54:16.10]So many spies over here.
[54:17.00]Those two words are related.
[54:18.02]They're not.
[54:18.82]You've never heard that before.
[54:20.81]Have you never heard that?
[54:22.87]Amazeballs.
[54:24.23]I can say this is amazing, but would I ever say this event is balls?
[54:28.54]I don't know.
[54:29.17]No, no.
[54:29.83]I don't think the two can be separated and still mean the same thing.
[54:33.11]That's what I thought.
[54:33.92]Want to also give a shout-out to EGC and Fire, the best TFT communities ever, plus a question for Jerma.
[54:40.01]What was the making of the live Jerma Rumble like, and what was your personal favorite character?
[54:45.93]Pac-Man.
[54:47.26]I don't even have to... I can answer that one immediately.
[54:49.32]Pac-Man's my favorite character.
[54:52.16]But... What about Mrs. Pac-Man?
[54:54.69]Mrs. Pac-Man's cool, too.
[54:56.29]That's Pac-Man's favorite character.
[54:59.40]You would hope so.
[55:00.68]I mean, the making of that Rumble was...
[55:03.18]It was kind of crazy.
[55:04.68]That's not a real wrestling ring.
[55:06.48]That's a boxing ring.
[55:08.06]So it was like landing on concrete.
[55:11.75]People were doing moves to each other.
[55:12.79]That was not comfortable at all.
[55:14.91]That was made out of solid bricks.
[55:16.62]It was landing on that.
[55:17.38]Every single person that was in that ring got hurt.
[55:22.58]Not to the point where anyone had to seriously get hurt.
[55:25.03]Like going to the hospital.
[55:25.77]But everybody was really sore after that whole thing was over.
[55:28.97]So...
[55:29.94]It was great, though.
[55:31.24]I enjoyed it.
[55:32.25]I enjoyed the pain, as they say.
[55:35.25]It was definitely fun to make.
[55:37.84]And I'm glad people thought it was funny.
[55:41.02]Because if it wasn't funny, then I would be in trouble.
[55:45.97]Where'd that spy go?
[55:49.22]He's still over here.
[55:51.36]We've got another $95 donation here.
[55:53.60]This one from Luxor who says, Hey, look here again.
[55:56.25]I'm hopefully preemptively donating $95 out of the $100 for the dabbing bet.
[56:01.16]Thanks for holding out.
[56:03.03]Thank God.
[56:03.49]Because I've been waiting to move my arm a little bit over for a long time.
[56:07.12]I know you were trying your hardest to hold back your dab.
[56:09.74]Seriously though, thank you guys so much.
[56:11.48]Last year was my first Tip of the Hat, and I had so much fun watching.
[56:14.83]The finale brought me to tears, specifically Krunk's story that really pushed me over the edge.
[56:18.84]You guys are doing amazing work, and you can bet I'll be trying to donate even more next Tip of the Hat.
[56:24.05]Good luck with the rest of Toth.
[56:25.37]Also, chat, come fight me IRL.
[56:28.03]We'll see who can throw the most money at Toth.
[56:31.77]Let's make it a competition.
[56:32.75]That was definitely a highlight last year.
[56:34.40]I mean, Krump's story was incredible.
[56:36.60]The whole chat was in tears.
[56:38.32]The whole room.
[56:39.99]Yeah.
[56:40.87]Yeah, I remember having my heartstrings tugged quite significantly.
[56:45.94]Pulled out of my chest.
[56:47.06]It's pretty meta, because I remember being in the room, and after you'd been on the sofa, you kind of moved to the side.
[56:51.97]So everybody was like really emotional in the room, you know, you were welling up and then I had my phone out with Twitch chat on it.
[56:57.68]There was just all these Bible thumps that I was sitting like crying in the room typing BibleThump, BibleThump.
[57:05.77]I noticed that a lot of guys in the other room in the green room have their phones on and they're reading Twitch chat because it's just such a good part of the experience.
[57:12.94]Because you can just like say an emote and then they just go for it.
[57:16.01]Yeah.
[57:16.74]you want to do that I see I I feel like it has to be natural because if I bring it up then it's like it's forced and I don't like that you could go for one of your own yours are fantastic yeah but I don't know that my name though but they're just amazing whenever I see them around raise mom I use raise mom all the time
[57:38.53]So fun.
[57:42.25]That is not what I meant.
[57:43.43]Come on.
[57:45.80]That's not fair.
[57:47.00]That's not fair.
[57:49.00]You said it.
[57:50.62]$100 from Cloudkicker, who says, just want to say thanks to everyone there.
[57:54.05]Raze, Wyatt, Kurt, and Jerma, you guys have brought me so much joy over the years.
[57:59.20]No problem, man.
[58:02.46]Thanks, mate.
[58:03.04]I'd just like to remind MrSlinz that he would eat a banana when we hit 100k.
[58:07.61]Yes, that's right.
[58:08.21]I don't want to take away from this amazing pubbing action.
[58:11.25]No, I think you do.
[58:13.00]No, it's not that good.
[58:13.94]I hoped somebody would mention it.
[58:15.18]You made a promise.
[58:16.40]Yeah.
[58:16.90]Drink that banana.
[58:17.84]We'll make it quick.
[58:19.22]Don't make it quick.
[58:20.12]Jerma said he wanted to watch Intimately.
[58:22.53]I didn't say Intimately.
[58:24.59]I said Intently.
[58:25.29]Do you want to come join us on the couch for a little bit?
[58:26.77]I'll come join you.
[58:27.65]Do it.
[58:29.26]Do you need a banana?
[58:30.32]Do we need to, like, hand this off?
[58:31.54]I think he has a banana.
[58:33.60]I have a banana.
[58:34.52]This one looks a little bit brown, though, and it's scaring me.
[58:37.11]Slint has also picked the largest of the three bananas.
[58:39.45]That's right.
[58:39.81]I'll go for the smaller one.
[58:41.02]Slint reckons he can handle a huge banana.
[58:43.22]No, no, no.
[58:44.28]Ah, jeez.
[58:46.20]Just, like, throw it at the wall a few times.
[58:48.65]I'll make it quick.
[58:50.89]Don't make a big deal.
[58:51.63]Can you open this for me, actually?
[58:53.34]You're going to bruise it?
[58:56.17]You need to put a headset on, my friend.
[58:58.51]I need to hear your... See, I don't know why this is a thing that we're doing.
[59:06.91]Because bananas are such an old meme.
[59:10.61]It's an annual meme.
[59:15.34]Ruined.
[59:19.29]You were the one who said it.
[59:20.17]I also wanted to tag you.
[59:22.17]What am I doing over here?
[59:24.66]That's okay.
[59:25.32]Who pulled off the pull-off thing?
[59:27.62]There's no pull-off thing there, unfortunately.
[59:29.62]What's going on here?
[59:31.01]There's no pull-off thing?
[59:32.15]No, not the bigger one.
[59:34.81]Okay, fine.
[59:35.59]It's huge, dude.
[59:36.95]That is a big banana.
[59:38.29]Yeah, it's a big banana.
[59:40.36]Do you know how to open a banana?
[59:42.04]Because I don't want to touch all over your food.
[59:44.69]It's going to open this baby up.
[59:46.31]Easy, easy.
[59:46.85]Wow, you ripped that one open.
[59:49.11]Easy.
[59:49.40]No chill for that banana.
[59:51.32]It didn't see it coming.
[59:52.18]Well, I lost a little bit of the tip there.
[59:53.64]That's alright.
[59:54.37]They don't need the tip.
[59:55.39]Alright.
[59:58.57]Are we trying to?
[60:00.62]This doesn't even make any sense.
[60:03.10]He's just eating a banana.
[60:06.09]Be careful.
[60:07.01]Be careful.
[60:10.34]That banana didn't stand a chance.
[60:14.68]Is that or is that not the most delicious banana you've ever had?
[60:17.83]Everyone should eat bananas like that.
[60:19.41]Was it ripe?
[60:20.97]Was it at least ripe?
[60:21.83]Give us a thumbs up if it was ripe.
[60:22.99]I don't mean to put you on the spot, but what's your favorite thing about TFT?
[60:28.92]What happens if I talk at a two mic?
[60:32.25]You're just twice as loud.
[60:34.09]Am I just twice as loud?
[60:37.27]What a good gag.
[60:38.90]I totally got him with that one.
[60:41.96]How was the experience?
[60:42.80]Pretty good.
[60:43.68]Pretty good?
[60:44.06]Yeah, it was pretty good.
[60:44.89]Because I love bananas.
[60:45.57]In my mouth.
[60:45.97]That was pretty good.
[60:46.65]You love bananas.
[60:48.23]Well, of course in your mouth, not as decorated.
[60:51.76]That was a great bit that we did.
[60:54.76]That was comedy right there.
[60:55.94]That was worth every moment.
[60:57.57]That was a comedy bit.
[60:58.57]Worth every penny.
[60:59.41]That was great.
[61:00.29]That was amazing.
[61:00.91]You'd promise to do something for $100,000.
[61:02.71]You're right.
[61:02.99]I have to hold you to account, my friend.
[61:04.70]That's right.
[61:05.98]Absolutely.
[61:07.26]For the kids.
[61:07.98]Well, that is also the end of our pubbing segment.
[61:12.13]So we're going to send it to a small break here.
[61:14.63]We'll swap the people up on the couch, in the chair, on the player desks.
[61:18.37]Hey, that was a great eating of a banana.
[61:20.93]You deserve a hug.
[61:21.74]You did well, Slim.
[61:22.76]You did a really good job.
[61:24.42]Now eat the other one.
[61:25.70]And we'll see.
[61:27.12]Is anybody going to eat that skin?
[61:28.30]I believe the next one is the surfing segment, which is going to be coming right up.
[61:36.85]god I can't believe this happened are we still alive I love skins I love banana skins give me that water they're my favorite are we still we're gonna yeah we're gonna we're gonna take a look they just didn't want to cut it while you were just uh that was like that was the cutting point like anybody eat the skin we're gonna we're gonna take a look at an advert for one step camp as well just before this just to give you guys a flavor of what we're all here for
[62:08.78]As soon as you get here, you'll just have a blast.
[62:11.29]Right away, you're starting off with fun activities.
[62:13.75]You can go swimming, or you can do arts and crafts.
[62:15.92]We go on a lot of trips, and we fish, and we sleep in sands.
[62:20.59]We go to some lakes.
[62:21.63]It's pretty cool.
[62:23.02]You almost forget that you're just away from home because it's just so welcoming and so fun that you're doing all these activities.
[62:30.03]And it goes by so fast, and it's just such a fun, amazing time.
[62:33.36]I still have a lot of my friends I made my first year.
[62:36.74]I just kind of kept them all close.
[62:39.70]And they're like family.
[62:42.03]They're not really friends.
[62:43.07]They're family to me.
[62:44.45]Here, like...
[62:46.11]you fit in just the same like we all had some type of cancer or brain tumor or something so it's kind of we're all the same and it's not like you can pick them out of the crowd.
[62:58.47]Camp is a place kind of where you can feel free to talk about your experience but you don't have to feel like you have to answer any questions and you just feel really comfortable
[63:08.20]and embraced by all of these welcoming people.
[63:11.08]I just love all the environments.
[63:13.12]It's so peaceful and so relaxing knowing that you always have somebody to lean on if you're sad and there's so many friends I make here.
[63:20.27]I get why it's like so nerve-wracking for some people because it's like when I was eight I wasn't away from my parents for like a week.
[63:26.72]These people are my second family.
[63:29.14]I kind of have to come back.
[63:31.83]I want to come back.
[63:33.59]So don't worry.
[63:34.69]You're gonna make a lot of friends here.
