[00:01.82]Oh, shit.
[00:02.40]Hold on.
[00:02.89]There we go.
[00:03.91]Hi.
[00:04.03]What's happening?
[00:30.55]How were the cheese toasties?
[00:31.67]They were absolutely delicious.
[00:37.55]Before we get started today, with, uh, you know, Drew Crew.
[00:41.61]That's not even a phrase I coined.
[00:47.39]I saw that in chat yesterday.
[00:48.57]I was like, that's pretty good.
[00:50.91]Drew Crew.
[00:51.73]I like it.
[00:56.27]And to solve some mysteries...
[00:59.28]I've been told this one's actually good.
[01:01.76]Now, I don't know where that stands.
[01:04.34]On the Nancy Drew tier list.
[01:06.50]Oh, fuck.
[01:06.94]I just gave it away.
[01:07.68]You can see the title.
[01:10.17]What else would be Drew Crew?
[01:13.17]Oh, yeah.
[01:13.39]We're doing Drew Crew.
[01:14.51]What else could that be?
[01:15.71]Are we playing Price is Right?
[01:20.97]What else could it be?
[01:25.94]This apparently is a good one.
[01:28.63]I'm gonna hold all judgment until we play 50% of the streams income should go to that guy 50% That's not gonna happen anyways
[01:59.93]One thing before we go.
[02:01.41]Not go.
[02:02.03]I mean, like, go as in, like, step on the gas, not hit the brakes.
[02:06.21]I have just opened a channel in the Discord.
[02:09.69]Two channels, actually.
[02:10.49]One of them doesn't work yet.
[02:12.89]They are the New Year's Eve Worst Dreams Worst of the Year Awards.
[02:18.29]We're going to do that again this year.
[02:21.63]The categories are up.
[02:24.01]If you want to see what you can possibly nominate, the list of what they are are there.
[02:32.28]That channel is open for discussion.
[02:34.93]There's a separate, just submit a nomination, which the rules aren't there yet.
[02:41.02]Uh, I kind of want to give, like, a day or so, or, like, just for people to discuss and collect some of the data.
[02:48.58]There's a category on there that's not really a category, but it's something that I want to do.
[02:53.26]Um, if it's possible.
[02:55.31]I would like for whoever wants to embarrass me, go for it.
[02:59.71]Find all the times or specific times where I have told a lie.
[03:04.81]Because I'd like to see, I'd like to, you have to look in the mirror sometimes.
[03:09.27]I want a full compilation of every time I've ever lied on this stream.
[03:16.23]Just play a 15 straight minute video of every clip every time I've said something that wasn't true.
[03:26.86]The video is going to be too long.
[03:28.34]Well, we can condense it.
[03:30.46]I'd like to try.
[03:34.39]15 minutes.
[03:35.55]Yeah.
[03:36.85]You can shrink that down.
[03:38.43]You can shrink 150 hours down to 15 minutes.
[03:40.99]You just need, like, two words, three, one sentence.
[03:47.71]You know, like, I will play Ace Attorney.
[03:49.97]That's not even two seconds.
[03:52.02]You think I've lied more than 150 times on this stream?
[03:54.98]I don't think so.
[04:06.55]He's probably lying right now.
[04:10.53]I said Drew Crew first.
[04:12.07]Don't let this man's greed fool you.
[04:15.69]Speaking of Drew Crew.
[04:18.13]Yeah.
[04:20.01]Yes, we're playing Nancy Drew in the Sea of Darkness.
[04:25.15]I...
[04:26.91]This is what people want.
[04:28.94]This is what they want me to do.
[04:32.38]I was alright with maybe just doing one, but I did buy like seven.
[04:39.68]This probably isn't even a Nancy Drew stream.
[04:41.68]Well, what do you think this is?
[04:42.40]A screenshot?
[04:45.94]Here we go.
[04:47.30]Get ready for Nancy Drew, Sea of Darkness.
[04:50.15]I'm going.
[04:52.03]Amateur.
[04:53.94]uh can this be changed on the fly because the last time I got really stuck I just I what it doesn't matter I'll just cheat more challenging no hints basic task list yeah I'll just it doesn't matter I'll just look up the answer if I can't get it uh
[05:18.02]Why are we all cheering?
[05:19.56]What?

[05:36.01]Oh, it's getting close!
[05:38.86]Uh...
[05:47.44]I got your contact info through a friend of mine.
[05:51.90]I think you did some good sleuthing work with her in Scotland not too long ago.
[05:57.45]For some background on yours truly, you could officially call me a locator of fine goods per se.
[06:02.45]I think condense this down.
[06:04.77]This is too much.
[06:05.55]This is too huge of a letter.
[06:06.61]Nobody can write this small and this legible.
[06:10.13]You guys ever tried to write a letter?
[06:11.33]And not on lined paper, by the way.
[06:13.24]Yeah, right.
[06:16.01]Yeah, you can write like that?
[06:17.40]Uh-uh.
[06:20.24]I actually do, though.
[06:21.08]You cannot write that perfect on paper that's not lined paper.
[06:24.04]Uh-uh.
[06:25.80]No way.
[06:28.44]No one writes letters anymore.
[06:29.85]Yeah, they just write emails, but still.
[06:32.93]I literally can.
[06:34.15]No, you can't.
[06:38.49]Go back for the boots.
[06:41.01]Anyways, here's some background on yours truly.
[06:42.93]Yeah, yeah.

[07:23.80]Alright, who cares about any of this?
[07:25.54]Wait.

[21:24.46]I'm not going to write this whole letter.
[21:26.70]I'm not writing the whole letter.
[21:34.49]I've...
[21:39.01]Who the fuck wants me to do this?
[21:41.71]Nobody wants me to do this.
[21:45.75]Nobody wants me to write the entire letter.
[21:48.23]You want me to write the entire letter?

[23:14.22]You would think this person was insane.
[23:23.08]If I write this whole letter, I have to give it to somebody.
[23:33.05]I have to finish the letter.
[23:34.29]Alright, once I finish the letter, we can do something else.

[24:40.63]Is that a new paragraph?
[24:41.97]In other words.
[24:50.18]That's so much space.
[24:51.34]God damn it.
[24:58.40]In other words, I'm a treasure hunter.
[24:59.98]I... I have so much more to do.
[25:06.71]I have so much more to do.
[25:08.61]Let's just, let's cut, uh, let's cut to the... Currently, I'm in Iceland in a small town.
[25:24.80]We can skip the rest.
[25:29.08]Currently, I'm in Iceland in a small town.
[25:33.32]Uh, called Skiprott.
[25:38.58]Skip brought right When I first arrived of this is all this doesn't mean I don't need any of this stuff Keep going keep going keep going.
[25:51.51]I don't know I People leaving Let's get to the end let's get to the end
[26:07.84]I helped to, uh, restore the... Oh, that's so funny.
[26:20.29]Imagine opening up a stream and the guy's writing a letter and you're like, I'm fucking out of here.
[26:55.12]I hope to restore the ship along with my business partner.
[26:58.84]This guy, Magnus, under two conditions.
[27:01.07]One, I would be entitled to a portion of any treasure found.
[27:03.53]Okay, cool.
[27:11.87]I'm not doing that.
[27:13.97]We bled out like 500 people.
[27:16.69]And the stream hadn't even started yet.
[27:18.15]I'm not doing that.
[27:26.77]Why does this look so frame-rated?
[27:29.57]Oh, I gotta turn this up.
[27:48.65]There you go, now you can hear it.
[27:53.87]I'm sensing you're a little stressed out about this.
[27:57.10]Ugh, I'm so mad I've been an inch away from setting this town on fire.
[28:00.36]On fire?
[28:00.90]Like robot chicken.
[28:02.14]Are you okay?
[28:03.50]What?
[28:04.38]Just the fire comment.
[28:05.76]I thought... Metaphors, Nancy.
[28:07.73]Keep up with me here.
[28:09.01]So listen, right now I'm focused on this town, Skibrot.
[28:12.61]There's this ship in town that was being rebuilt.
[28:15.63]Real old, 18th century.
[28:17.55]I offered to sponsor the rebuilding project to get the ship floating again.
[28:20.87]Mostly because I'm super nice and cool like that.
[28:23.41]But also because there's a rumor about the treasure on board worth millions.
[28:29.66]Magnus, the man in charge of the project, and my business partner promised we'd find it and split the earnings.
[28:37.12]But he's gone missing now?
[28:38.66]So am I Nancy?
[28:39.28]Are you always Nancy?
[28:40.44]And left me looking like a fool.
[28:44.38]okay uh was there any proof uh when did he when did that happen he disappeared some time before our ship crashed into the harbor they say he must have wait so they crashed so they crashed fallen in the water but the guy sails for a living is everybody alright why do we don't we care about that first
[29:06.48]Okay.
[29:06.78]Uh, I get it.
[29:09.20]You think he ran off with the gold then.
[29:12.50]Oh, shit.
[29:13.84]There was a shitload of money that came in.
[29:15.28]Oh, audio.
[29:15.94]I got home.
[29:16.44]Let me delete these.
[29:19.73]My audio capture's all fucked up because I tried to... Alright.

[33:06.50]Alright, you ready?
[33:25.39]Let's go.
[33:26.01]Let's do it.
[33:28.42]Like, right here, right?
[33:30.42]You're a shrew.
[33:32.28]How did you... How did people do this?
[33:37.26]You can't... Like... You definitely... You had to put this shit down on a table and, like, smush your... This is how they had to do it.
[33:57.43]There's no other way to do that.
[34:02.01]Should I do more than one?
[34:07.39]That's like, that's not even lipstick, that's like you ate, you drank a bunch of Kool-Aid.
[34:25.62]It's blood now
[35:07.23]Christ.
[35:43.21]I didn't even know what I looked like until right now.
[35:45.55]That's from smushing my mouth.
[35:57.80]Joker.
[36:05.25]Nancy fucking Drew.
[36:06.31]I haven't even played a minute of it.
[36:22.07]You don't know what you look like, how am I supposed- I just- I ran in and grabbed one of Kim's lipsticks.
[36:28.47]Look, look, look, look.
[36:39.24]That's a little kid that ate too much... Look at comical how much chocolate is on that kid's mouth.
[36:46.00]Except it's not, it's lipstick.
[36:47.84]It's... Oh my god.
[37:00.55]Why was I eating it?
[37:01.37]No, that's... It was on kind of normally and then I smushed my face into the desk.
[37:06.53]Is it still?
[37:06.99]Yeah, it's still there.
[37:07.93]What, do you think it disappeared?
[37:09.59]You got it in mommy's lipstick drawer.
[37:26.02]Okay, I... What do I want to do?
[37:29.04]I can't leave again.
[37:29.76]I've left like six times.
[37:33.74]So many times.
[37:37.54]This music.
[37:39.48]Okay, I need to compose myself here.
[37:44.49]Oh my god, why did you give that many subs?
[37:49.83]JermaSucks just gave 61 subs?
[37:55.98]Holy shit, dude.
[37:58.34]What are you doing?
[38:00.68]That's a lot.

[38:21.16]Thank you, all of you.
[38:27.34]Sounds like I've got my work cut out for me.
[38:29.79]Can I take a look at the ship?
[38:31.81]Technically, yes.
[38:32.81]Awesome.
[38:33.35]How do I get on board?
[38:35.61]By not being near me.
[38:37.45]Elizabeth controls the ship, and she hates my guts.
[38:40.57]She removed the gangway to my ship that I paid for.
[38:44.59]Did she give you a reason?
[38:46.65]Oh, something about her family line and ancient blood feuds.
[38:49.81]Am I going to just stream like this?
[38:51.01]I...
[38:52.55]When I take a break, I'll get it on.
[38:53.57]Talk to Sorin, the festival organizer.
[38:55.89]He'll make sure she lets you on.
[38:57.60]I... I... Just wait.
[39:05.06]I'll take a... I just... Let me... One minute.
[39:10.20]What do people in town think of the dis- I don't even know what's going on.

[39:14.57]Oh.
[39:14.77]Leave it on.
[39:15.95]No.
[39:16.09]I can't- I do have it all over my hands.
[39:36.39]Oh my god, what the hell?
[39:37.23]What's going on?
[39:37.77]What?
[39:37.97]Oh my gosh, Coke, are you serious?
[39:40.27]Okay.

[39:45.79]Stay warm.
[39:47.93]Okay, so, uh, explore the town, search the ship.
[39:53.85]How do you walk?
[39:54.46]Alright, explore the town.
[39:57.04]I want to go check out the ship.
[40:01.22]Spamming it in channel points.
[40:02.48]Oh yeah, I have to, like, do channel points.
[40:04.04]I forgot.
[40:07.12]What about the rope?
[40:08.98]The gangway is missing.
[40:10.44]There's no way on board.
[40:11.32]I need a new gangway?
[40:13.66]What?
[40:15.18]Oh my god, what is this?
[40:15.86]What is this?
[40:16.16]Oh my god, are you serious?
[40:16.92]Co-gaming.
[40:25.24]So I need a new one.
[40:30.64]Alright, I have to go.
[40:32.18]I have to like, not like leave, but I have to like, this is like, I feel like, I don't know why, I feel like this is like seeping, I feel like this is seeping into my bloodstream.
[40:38.99]I really do.
[40:40.15]I really feel like this is like seeping into my bloodstream.
[40:42.15]Alright, I'll be back.
[40:44.88]Give me a minute.
[43:01.61]It's not working.
[43:03.69]It's not working.
[43:05.89]I just ate like a person.
[43:09.26]What did I eat right here?
[43:11.38]Get off.
[43:14.20]I just went hunting.
[43:21.82]Like in a pack.
[43:27.09]Flaming hot Cheetos.
[43:31.03]If anybody asks, I'm really like Flamin' Hot Cheetos to a fact where I'm permanently stained.
[43:46.64]I'm willing to do this because like, fuck it, who cares, ready?
[43:52.12]I'm just gonna pretend like I'm shit-faced on like really, really heavy red wine.
[44:17.39]What does this mean?
[44:19.33]What does this mean?
[44:21.17]What?
[44:21.47]Oh, that's from... Okay.
[45:23.10]Uh... Yeah so if you guys... That's—they're gone, I drank three of them. Is something wr—off with my camera? Hey thanks— Thanks a lot Coke Gaming.
[45:59.84]So what do you guys want to do?
[46:01.96]I can barely do anything.
[46:04.21]I really don't want to lie to you guys, but I seriously fucking can't do shit right now.
[46:15.80]I— We were going to play Nancy Drew, but I don't even remember what the first part of it was.
[46:34.81]"TF2", "play TF2".
[46:35.87]I'm not playing TF2.
[46:40.22]Why would I play TF2 right now?
[46:42.00]It's not fucking gonna happen.
[46:51.14]Uh... I think we'll, um...
[47:01.18]I think we'll, uh, probably have to call it today here, I think.
[47:08.11]I think we'll, uh, "drink more".
[47:14.38]Somebody ban that person!
[47:34.53]"You didn't go off camera".
[47:37.47]Shut the fuck up.
[47:39.45]You fucking idiot.
[47:41.98]Shut the fuck up.
[47:49.34]"Go to sleep".
[47:52.19]I don't have to go to sleep.
[47:53.69]I'm an adult.
[47:55.59]I'm an adult.
[48:10.01]Okay, I'm getting off the camera.
[48:18.27]But seriously though, um... I... I can't get this off.
[48:35.16]I'm just making it worse.
[48:36.12]I'm just getting... Hold on, let me fix my like disgusting hair.
[48:40.85]I'm just getting like red face.
[48:43.50]It's like spreading.
[48:45.22]I need toothpaste.
[48:46.04]I need a special tissue.
[48:47.78]Kim has this stuff.
[48:56.81]I'm just going to be wine mouth.
[48:58.97]Alright, let's go.
[49:00.49]Let's play Nancy Drew.
[49:06.11]This... What?
[49:10.33]Dude, this... This stream has been going for an hour.
[49:15.63]Holy shit.
[49:22.25]Wow.
[49:24.35]Alright, Nancy Drew, let's go.
[49:30.49]Seriously though, on my next pee break, I'm gonna have to put like vinegar all over my mouth.
[49:35.07]I don't know what to do.
[49:36.25]Alright, let's explore the town.
[49:46.09]Uh, meat?
[49:47.49]Is this meat?
[49:49.95]Chaos.
[49:50.96]At skip rock commerce meeting.
[49:56.56]What the fuck was that?
[49:58.94]What's the lipstick brand?
[50:00.12]I don't know.
[50:02.96]Kim's.
[50:04.36]Kim's lipstick.
[50:06.18]The color, um, big red.
[50:10.12]I don't know.
[50:10.90]It's Kim's.
[50:13.60]Okay, a town hall meeting this week erupted into Discord when a local fisherman caused a scene of what he calls a threat to core Icelandic values.
[50:20.58]Skipwrought citizen Gunnar Tonneson brought a written petition to the meeting hoping to interrupt the board's vote on fiscal allocation for the annual Ancestors Festival.
[50:30.60]Lot of reading.
[50:31.16]Ooh, is this a hook?
[50:35.28]A meat hook?
[50:40.12]A Discord town hall meeting.
[50:46.06]Alright, I got a Meat Hook.
[50:50.48]This is a... Meesty Skip?
[50:54.01]The Meesty Skip.
[50:57.87]Meesty Skip.
[51:01.53]Sleep Near.
[51:16.81]What the... That's Star Wars.
[51:20.41]Okay.
[51:20.86]I was wondering what the hell that was.
[51:21.94]Alright.
[51:27.26]Is this a menu?
[51:27.88]This is a dining room.
[51:30.34]Good day.
[51:31.00]Hi there.
[51:31.60]I'm investigating a recent disappearance.
[51:34.04]My name's Nancy Drew.
[51:36.01]Speak up, girl.
[51:37.75]My name's Nancy Drew.
[51:39.53]Louder!
[51:40.65]I said my name's Nancy Drew.
[51:44.53]Mind your ship flag and temper.
[51:47.25]Looks like we got a real angry one here.
[51:50.67]Name's Gunnar, but you can call me Gunnar.
[51:53.91]Gunnar.
[51:54.20]A skip is my home.
[51:56.88]Louder, louder.
[51:59.12]Are you a sailor?
[52:00.98]Was long ago.
[52:03.16]I gave up the sea for good and I'll never sail again.
[52:06.50]You still look like a sailor to me.
[52:08.70]What does a sailor look like?
[52:10.18]It's a certain quality.
[52:11.94]I can't quite place it.
[52:14.17]Worn?
[52:15.17]Broken?
[52:16.15]Bitter?
[52:17.05]The sea chewed me up and spat me back out and I lost everything in her waves.
[52:21.97]If you can do a convincing Scottish accent, you will always have voice work somewhere.
[52:27.17]Someone's always looking for the Scottish accent.
[52:29.41]No matter what, it doesn't matter.
[52:49.48]are you talking about this is not Scottish what is this what is it it's not ice icelandic did you know magnus what sure did never liked him did something happen between you two
[53:12.59]no I don't like anyone I don't think I like you I'm still going it over norwegian chat icelandic is nothing like this thank you doesn't need friends already have two mug and chair so you so you were wrong too I was wrong and you were wrong we both get to be equally wrong it's good what about your fingers about your fingers my lucky three is that what you call them
[53:42.52]Sure is.
[53:43.44]It's a long story.
[53:44.68]Now, there I was.
[53:46.32]What?
[53:46.70]Out in the pitch black of night with no sign of shore and only my fishing spear.
[53:52.64]Then suddenly, I saw a shadow.
[53:54.90]It was a mighty squid, the greatest hunter of them all.
[53:58.46]That's a lie.
[53:58.72]A few men have learned to see it and tell the tale.
[54:01.66]So I pulled out my spear just a little too fast, mind you.
[54:05.47]And that's how you lost your fingers?
[54:09.28]Is this supposed to be photos or drawings?
[54:11.23]So the squid took your fingers
[54:27.25]No, no, no, no!
[54:28.81]Right as I thought I was dead, a massive shark leapt out of the waves and ate the squid.
[54:34.61]It was the sleeper shark, a solid six meters long with four rows of teeth.
[54:39.77]He bit my arm and pulled me under as I gasped for my last breath.
[54:43.67]So it was a shark then?
[54:45.45]No!
[54:47.19]I managed to punch him in the nose.
[54:49.45]Do you ever fight a shark?
[54:51.27]You know how to punch him in the nose?
[54:53.25]He let me go.
[54:54.19]I swam like a merman and made it back to shore.
[54:57.55]Three months later, I was in a woodshop accident.
[55:00.63]Right, that's what it is.
[55:01.85]That's what I know the movie.
[55:04.33]At least it makes for a great story.
[55:06.27]I mean, that's... That's...
[55:16.21]Have you met Dagny?
[55:17.79]Who?
[55:18.33]This guy is based.
[55:18.95]She's the woman involved with the Heroic High's restoration.
[55:21.38]Brown hair, about yea high.
[55:24.10]Ah, a tough little mink of a woman.
[55:27.30]Not bad in my book.
[55:28.80]Did you see her the day of the ship crash?
[55:31.28]Yeah, she was there, but I paid no attention to the mink.
[55:36.06]Okay.
[55:36.68]I heard you have problems with the festival the last couple of years.
[55:40.21]Why?
[55:40.29]I heard you've had problems with the festival the last couple of years.
[55:44.39]Care to talk about that?
[55:46.01]Why are you dumping hot tar?
[55:47.63]Oh.

[62:31.60]Thousands perished immediately into the madness, and the sky grew dark and even foreign lands were covered.
[62:39.64]We called those times the Mist Hardships, and in that darkness, the people of Skipbro struggled to survive.

[74:56.86]I have no idea what any of this stuff is.
[74:59.78]There's this much shit on a boat?
[75:01.58]I thought it was a big bed sheet.
[75:03.22]Like two big bed sheets on two large poles.
[75:07.96]I don't know there was this many segments.
[75:12.64]I don't even know what's a jib.
[75:15.32]The, uh... The four top sail.
[75:19.30]Main top sail.
[75:25.85]Key to finding the treasure is learning about the ship.
[75:29.91]Where's the jib?
[75:32.88]Alright, um, I don't care.
[75:34.50]Parts of a ship.
[75:37.80]Sail.
[75:41.99]Oh, here we go.
[75:43.09]This will help us.
[75:48.23]Alright, I got it.
[75:51.41]Cheating.
[75:53.85]How is learning cheating?
[75:57.66]Why would I ever know this information?
[76:00.66]You want me to walk down the path and find what all these are named?
[76:04.54]This is just learning what these are and then clicking on them.
[76:13.41]Uh, where's the flying... There's the flying jib.
[76:19.03]It's not even on here.
[76:24.19]What about the one underneath?

[76:28.35]Is this one?
[76:32.64]Do they have different names for everything?
[76:36.02]This is supposed to be the Four Moonsail.
[76:39.84]Four Stay Sail.
[76:47.45]This is the wrong sheet.
[76:50.42]This thing's called the spanker.
[76:54.28]Uh... Incorrect, apparently.
[76:57.02]Parts of a ship.
[77:01.22]What is it about this one?
[77:05.31]The main mast is the one in the middle.
[77:06.71]Okay.
[77:08.79]So this is main mast.
[77:11.51]Main topsail.
[77:12.95]Okay.

[77:49.70]Because people call these different things.
[77:51.76]Somebody said this is the beak.
[77:54.76]This is the spanker on one list.
[78:03.70]Alright, here we go.
[78:04.48]This looks like a good one.
[78:09.77]Main map, Krosna.
[78:11.01]Okay, Shrouds of the... Officer's Quill?
[78:15.17]No, this is like... The Four Top Gallant Sail.
[78:26.76]This is too many sails.
[78:29.92]Why are there too many?
[78:31.66]What is this thing?
[78:32.72]They're just floating.
[78:43.18]I can't even cheat.
[78:44.62]I can't cheat because these are all these images of like different from each other.
[78:50.31]Every single one of these is different to the next one because some of them only have one or two masts.
[78:58.17]I can't cheat.
[78:58.77]Holy fuck.
[79:00.94]Wait a minute.
[79:01.38]Is this actually?
[79:03.62]Is this from the game?

[85:07.12]Also, I have swords.
[85:08.98]Take a look at how many monitors I have over here.
[85:11.00]Check out my washing machine collection.
[85:37.02]There's people that collect everything.
[85:39.77]If you don't think that somebody has a basement full of washing machines and dryers, there definitely is.
[85:46.51]In fact, if there's somebody that collects it, that means that there's probably a convention for that too.
[85:52.88]I guarantee it.

[86:22.27]Most of these can be found on shipwrecks or near burial sites.
[86:25.73]Luckily, there are no lack of those in these parts, so I've got plenty of work to do.
[86:30.09]Old Gudrun over there is my favorite of all.
[86:32.53]She's a replica, not an original.
[86:34.43]I use her to knock icicles off the roof.

[89:58.22]Could you finish setting up the knots display?
[90:01.52]You just need to match the images to the knot they create.

[90:07.97]I don't- I- I have no idea what you're asking me to do.
[90:11.71]Put the knots next to the knots that they create?

[92:30.49]Are there any baits?
[92:31.77]Okay, there are no baits.
[92:35.03]Alright, we need to get the two big ones.
[92:40.19]There you go.
[92:42.39]Okay, looking good.
[92:48.67]Alright, looking good.
[92:57.84]This one's done.
[93:01.03]We're gonna need a game boomer here.
[93:04.19]Now, this one... This is the fat loop.
[93:07.85]So this requires a big loop.
[93:09.97]This one has a small loop.
[93:12.15]This one can come down here.
[93:13.69]I think we're gonna be good here.
[93:14.92]I need to have the finishing product.
[93:17.28]This is the finished product of this one.
[93:23.96]This looks like a pretty... Um...
[93:28.89]Literally no.
[93:31.92]I kind of want to make one of these.
[93:35.90]Yo.
[93:37.01]Fuck it.
[93:37.33]I'll be right back.
[95:30.11]Alright, let's give it a try.
[95:32.34]See if I can do this.
[95:35.72]So, we've got... Let me see if I can do the middle one.
[95:44.09]Yeah, I don't know if these are shoelaces or if these are strings that go inside of hoodies or pants.
[95:51.65]I found them.
[95:54.31]Alright, let's get the cam on.
[96:06.40]Move that around.
[96:10.20]Is this drawstring?
[96:11.14]Yeah, I think it is just drawstrings.
[96:15.05]It's just pants.
[96:20.55]Why does this keep happening?
[96:27.11]I keep having it so shrunken.
[96:30.55]No, it's got to be this way.
[96:33.09]There's the Xbox.
[96:37.73]There we go.
[96:38.27]Okay, right there.
[96:39.21]Let's see if I can do it.
[96:51.02]So we're looking... So we got... Here's our string.
[96:55.26]You need two strings, right?
[97:02.96]So you take the two ends like this.
[97:16.43]How far up does this need to be?
[97:25.18]Just need to go wrap around, like, how many times?
[97:31.70]Twice?
[97:32.72]So, like... Hold on a minute.
[97:34.74]This is... You go over and... Hold on.
[97:41.42]Am I supposed to be doing it like this?
[97:46.64]over like that again okay like that then you these are too but look at how long these are this is these are so long
[98:28.93]I need, like, three people to do this.
[98:32.73]Over, under... Like that.
[98:39.63]Okay, that part's done.
[98:41.67]And then we go like this.
[98:43.19]I need, like, a person to hold on to this shit.
[98:47.83]Like this.
[98:50.59]And then... From here... I go...
[98:58.05]What the fuck do you want me to do here?
[98:59.19]Again?
[98:59.43]Over, under, again?
[99:01.37]Like that?
[99:05.93]Oh dude, PogChamp!
[99:09.78]I got it.
[99:13.24]What the fuck, dude?
[99:14.50]Are you serious?
[99:24.08]How am I gonna do- Oh god, I'm not gonna be able to do these next ones.
[99:28.14]This next one is just, okay.
[99:29.96]Now I don't need the second one.
[99:31.82]What does this say?
[99:32.56]Do what?
[99:34.98]Do... Do... Do laundry.
[99:38.57]Okay, I gotta remember that.
[99:39.39]Alright, these... I gotta fix these ones.
[99:45.27]I didn't want to do it afterwards.
[99:46.31]Okay.
[99:49.19]Alright, so... I... How does this one even work?
[99:56.28]Is this something wrong?
[99:57.26]I don't know.
[100:02.00]around, and then through that loop, so that's correct.
[100:05.15]And then once you get to up here, you go around underneath, and then through, and then that's it.
[100:12.99]Is that right?
[100:17.98]No.
[100:18.44]This is for the one up there.
[100:21.34]This is for the one up.
[100:24.86]That starts there, and then it goes up around, and then... Let me do it.
[100:29.59]Let me do it.
[100:29.95]Let me do it.
[100:32.39]Switch top left and bottom left.
[100:33.89]No, that's not correct.
[100:39.50]Because this has to go up through that hoop.
[100:48.80]From there you go under, and then you wrap around, and then you... Like that?
[100:56.31]Yeah, like that.
[100:57.95]But that's this one.
[101:05.85]Got it.
[101:06.11]Okay, now let's try that one.
[101:12.60]This is actually kind of fun.
[101:13.68]I like this.
[101:16.16]Alright, so then we start.
[101:19.34]This is too long.
[101:20.34]It's too long.
[101:20.80]I can't do it.
[101:21.30]I can't do it.
[101:21.74]It's too long.
[101:24.30]So down.
[101:28.20]And then this has to go...
[101:36.34]make like a circle around and under like that right okay it's too long this is way too long and this one goes uh through the hoop here over
[102:05.52]like that and then under and then over this one needs to be much smaller but this one's going to be a little bigger uh wait hold on now that's okay so then this one goes underneath this one and then it wraps back down through over there through here under
[102:35.89]And then you pull it.
[102:47.47]Did I get it?
[102:47.89]I got it.
[102:55.81]Yeah, that's perfect.
[102:57.49]Doesn't feel very secure though.
[103:02.93]Nice.
[103:16.12]there we go there we go alright what's the last one I gotta get it right last one is start there I got I wanted to do this I wanted to make nuts is that like stupid I wanted to do this okay so then wrap it around there then that perfect oh no no no don't leave the screen don't leave the screen don't leave the screen don't leave the screen I want to see that oh god damn it I can't see
[103:50.15]Shit.
[103:53.31]Uh... It's alright, I can kinda see it.
[103:55.89]Click on it again?
[103:56.53]I can't.
[104:00.62]I can see it, I can see it.
[104:01.48]Okay, so this is long, so let's go... You just simply wrap it around like that.
[104:09.06]Like that.
[104:09.80]Okay.
[104:11.70]And then this... What does it do?
[104:13.40]It goes under... And then over, like, right there, immediately...
[104:22.29]And then... I can't see.
[104:28.51]And then... back... I can't see.
[104:34.74]Let me make it bigger so I can see it.
[104:39.64]This is insanely important to me, so... I can't click on it anymore.
[104:47.99]Alright, there we go.
[104:51.66]So let me do this again.
[104:54.35]Reset.
[104:58.35]Okay.
[104:59.33]It's just, this one has to be longer.
[105:01.73]So like that.
[105:03.59]And then it wraps back around.
[105:08.08]So under, under, and then over immediately right here like that.
[105:21.76]and then you go back under and through the loop like this and then out across to here and then that goes all the way around and then under itself like that and then tighten it
[105:58.06]Did I do it?
[106:02.59]Did I get it?
[106:12.67]Okay.
[106:12.87]No, I got it.
[106:13.25]That was correct.
[106:15.21]Nice.
[106:17.57]Somebody give me another knot to do.
[106:19.09]I want to do another knot.
[106:24.73]Anybody have one more I can do?
[106:30.28]You're a serial killer.
[106:31.52]What?
[106:32.92]Fun knots to do.
[106:38.15]Ooh, essential knots.
[106:39.01]How to tie 20 knots.
[106:45.75]Why is doing knots a serial killer?
[106:47.56]Okay, cool.
[106:49.16]We did the square knot.
[106:50.52]Okay, what about the bow?
[106:52.04]We did the bow line.
[106:53.40]The figure eight.
[106:54.22]The street... The sheet bend...
[106:57.46]Two half hitches.
[106:58.98]Taut hitch line.
[107:00.96]Fisherman's knot.
[107:01.84]Look at this one.
[107:02.36]Let me try this one just by hand.
[107:04.80]Check this one out.
[107:05.42]This one's fucked up.
[107:11.79]Look at how crazy this one is.
[107:12.79]Let's see if I can do it.
[107:16.83]That's not the image I wanted.
[107:28.53]Look at this thing.
[107:31.27]Cool, let me try it.
[107:39.44]Okay, let's get some music here.
[107:50.14]Let's try it.
[107:54.55]Okay, I think I do any of the other piece.
[107:57.43]So it looks like it's a small circle here.
[107:59.17]Cool.
[108:02.25]Like that.
[108:02.85]And then it goes underneath itself.
[108:05.35]Like this.
[108:06.93]Actually, underneath like three or four times.
[108:08.59]Like that.
[108:10.98]Through here.
[108:15.48]Looks good so far.
[108:19.72]I need to make it a little bigger though.
[108:37.39]Alright.
[108:38.19]Underneath, it's gotta go under.
[108:41.19]There we go.
[108:42.11]Like that.
[108:42.99]No, I lost that part.
[108:45.11]Okay, I can't.
[108:46.95]I can't.
[108:47.77]Up.
[109:15.79]This is breaking my finger, it's breaking my finger.
[109:28.72]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[109:31.23]I gotta... How do you escape?
[109:35.69]How to escape a knot.
[109:38.06]How to escape from, please.
[109:47.21]I'm Kevin Reeve with On Point Tactical.
[109:49.31]How do I get out of this?
[109:59.50]With both rope and duct tape, the key is presentation.
[110:02.26]What I want to do is present myself as very cooperative, but in reality I'm being somewhat passive-aggressive.
[110:10.39]I put my knuckles together and pull my hands in close to my chest.
[110:15.53]I point my knuckle towards his eyes.
[110:17.97]No, no, no, that's the wrong way!
[110:19.87]Wrong way!
[110:20.41]Wrong way!
[110:26.98]It's the wrong way!
[110:31.05]Oh!
[110:31.53]Oh, I just had to let go with my right hand.
[110:42.06]I was holding it.
[110:42.70]That was weird.
[110:43.22]Okay.
[110:46.74]That'll heal, I think.
[110:47.68]Okay.
[110:48.00]That'll heal nicely in the next six months.
[111:05.81]Okay.
[111:07.07]What's that sound?
[111:17.04]Oh, it's this.
[111:17.54]I was like, what's this sound?
[111:21.62]The knot.
[111:24.98]Make this a not stream.
[111:27.52]No, I did my I got trapped trying to do a fucking necktie segment, okay?
[111:33.84]I went doing that again.
[111:42.52]What did I get for this?
[111:45.35]What did I get for this?
[111:53.61]Something in the seat?
[111:56.13]Ooh.
[111:56.97]And I got $2,000 too.
[111:58.75]Oh shit, this stuff is still on screen.
[112:03.76]I'm sorry.
[112:04.26]Alright, let's get some slippers.
[112:11.44]$2,700.
[112:11.84]That's too much.
[112:17.14]This stuff is also expensive.
[112:18.37]I just fucking- I just bought it.
[112:19.93]I just bought it.
[112:20.53]I don't have any money left.
[112:21.61]I bought one.
[112:26.06]God damn it.
[112:35.80]I hope I need that item soon.
[112:41.83]Back to the learn Icelandic game.
[112:48.51]No, I have to go to bed.
[112:49.39]It hasn't even been one evening in this game.
[112:59.14]The screen is freaking fucked up.
[113:03.14]Alright, where do I go to sleep?
[113:05.18]You again.
[113:09.53]What do you think of Gunner?
[113:11.39]In terms of the treasure?
[113:12.91]He tried to sabotage the festival last year.
[113:14.97]Did he, though?
[113:16.31]Are you certain?
[113:17.29]I wouldn't be surprised if this is a stunt of his.
[113:21.73]Bye-bye.
[113:22.87]See you, Drew.
[113:24.45]Where's the bed?
[113:26.29]Explore the town.
[113:26.96]Search the ship.
[113:27.86]Explore the misty skip.
[113:31.50]I can't explore the thing because I can't get up there.
[113:34.23]Wait a minute.
[113:35.51]This wasn't here before.
[113:38.80]Who let you on board?
[113:40.12]If you're here for the festival, it's cancelled.
[113:42.59]I didn't mean to intrude.
[113:44.31]I'd just like to have a look around, if that's okay.
[113:47.17]My name's Nancy Drew.
[113:48.71]I'm a visitor.
[113:50.55]I know you're a tourist.
[113:51.97]We're a town of 300.
[113:53.59]I'm not a tourist.
[113:55.13]I'm here to investigate.
[113:56.75]Thanks for setting up that gangway for me, by the way.
[113:59.54]The gangway was meant for Soren.
[114:01.50]I didn't know he planned to let strangers on board.
[114:04.26]Are you with that snake of a woman?
[114:05.54]Hey.
[114:08.63]Yes, yes, I'm working with her if you're after just the gold I want nothing to do with you leave Wait, I'm not after any treasure.
[114:18.66]I just want to help find Magnus Magnus
[114:23.80]Look, I think we might have gotten off on the wrong foot.
[114:27.00]Maybe I should start over.
[114:28.64]My name's Nancy.
[114:30.12]It's really nice to meet you.
[114:31.22]Different voice actress?
[114:31.96]I'm Elizabeth.
[114:33.22]No, it's not, is it?
[114:35.36]What do you want with Magnus?
[114:37.17]Oh, good.
[114:37.97]So you know him?
[114:40.19]That's a question, isn't it?
[114:41.87]Is it?
[114:41.99]I thought I knew him.
[114:43.59]Maybe I was wrong.
[114:45.19]He's a pretty mysterious guy.
[114:46.71]Sounds like quite the mysterious guy.
[114:49.07]It doesn't matter.
[114:50.57]I want nothing to do with him now.
[114:52.63]Or you.
[114:54.25]What's in the bag?
[114:58.27]Ma'am, can I take a look at that bag, please?
[115:03.99]Hey, Elizabeth, may I borrow a snowmobile key?
[115:07.17]Depends.
[115:08.09]Are you going to steal it?
[115:09.77]Not this time.
[115:10.91]I think I'd have trouble fitting it into my carry-on luggage.
[115:13.59]It is a different person.
[115:14.45]Here's the key.
[115:15.20]We have tourists take them every year.
[115:17.44]I'm watching you.
[115:21.63]Got key.
[115:25.55]She stole it last time.
[115:27.35]What do you think happened to Magnus?
[115:29.55]The current rumor is that he fell overboard.
[115:31.12]What do you think happened to Magnus?
[115:33.16]The current rumor is that he fell overboard.
[115:35.60]Do I think he has drowned?
[115:37.04]Is that what you're asking?
[115:40.54]He might have.
[115:41.73]I didn't mean that.
[115:42.69]I didn't mean it that way.
[115:43.91]I certainly hope so.
[115:46.78]Some people think he ran off with some old treasure.
[115:49.58]It may be a coincidence.
[115:51.61]I do like... I really, really want to go shop at Old Navy now.
[115:53.47]Because everyone that we've seen so far was in an Old Navy commercial.
[115:57.99]Do not go to Old Navy.
[116:21.52]Old Navy Gaming?
[116:22.90]What?
[116:23.04]They look like mannequins.
[116:23.94]Oh, thank you, Old Navy Gaming.
[116:25.06]Old Navy Gaming.
[116:49.11]We really gotta get in.
[116:50.01]We gotta get in that Twitch culture.
[116:51.91]You know what I mean?
[116:52.83]We gotta get in there.
[116:56.26]Using your key.
[116:56.90]Oh, that doesn't fit.
[117:02.78]Crow's Nest.
[117:03.36]Let's go up.
[117:12.71]Jesus! 86.
[117:19.66]What does 86 mean?
[117:20.34]Is that... I don't know.
[117:43.88]Is this some kind of currency thing?
[117:45.24]Is this some kind of currency thing?
[117:48.47]Alright, let's get down.
[117:49.97]How do I get down?
[117:51.49]I'd be careful up here, though.
[117:52.55]At any moment, I could, like... I could... The cops are coming.
[117:56.92]I could... I could slip!
[117:57.94]Oh!
[117:58.96]Oh, shit!
[117:59.42]I'm up!
[118:02.48]Oh!
[118:02.68]Oh!
[118:21.68]I lost the game capture.
[118:26.65]There it is.
[118:29.93]Uh, 82, is this some kind of currency thing?
[118:31.15]86, is that a currency?
[118:33.93]Oh, wow, the Aurora boiling out is so cute right now.
[118:37.44]Right?
[118:38.80]It's absolutely beautiful.
[118:41.06]Something like that.
[118:58.04]Why did you do that?
[118:59.08]Why do you sound like me?
[119:00.70]What?
[119:03.58]Why do you sound like me?
[119:04.84]Alright, let's take this.
[119:08.20]This radio looks new, but the key's missing.
[119:11.94]Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.
[119:34.94]Pretty good song.
[119:41.73]Captain's log.
[119:43.91]Thank you, Hank Cheesecake, for the five community subs.
[119:46.51]I really appreciate that.
[119:48.89]Thank you.
[119:51.33]Here it is, one more time for you.
[119:53.64]Masts from tallest to shortest.
[119:58.27]We already did this.
[120:00.15]We just cheated for this one, that's fine.
[120:04.41]Can I pretend to steer the boat?
[120:08.14]Alright, Nancy, put it down.
[120:11.00]Wow, I can!
[120:12.70]Can I honk the horn?
[120:22.61]I don't think I can honk the horn.
[120:28.80]Let me go to the snowmobile.
[120:31.98]What is this?
[120:32.56]What do I need the gas for?
[120:45.12]Oh, for the snowmobile.
[120:50.61]That makes sense.
[120:58.42]I kind of want to take a look back here, though.
[121:03.29]Can I?
[121:03.75]No.
[121:04.07]Just leave.
[121:06.09]Just leave.
[121:07.05]Leave.
[121:09.11]What?
[121:09.29]Alright, to the snowmobile.
[121:10.45]Let's go.
[121:32.18]Hello?
[121:32.42]Oh, that's my ringtone.
[121:34.20]I thought that was my swishy outdoor winter pants.
[121:35.92]I haven't figured out the specifics.
[121:38.80]Is he?
[121:39.28]What are you talking about?
[122:02.24]Ned, will you take any other photos of yourself?
[122:05.65]It's our anniversary.
[122:06.37]Ned, dot, dot, dot.
[122:06.73]Uh...
[122:30.07]so am I under the impression that she forgot about their anniversary when they had a reservation planned but instead she got on a plane to Iceland or is he here too and why does why does he not know this
[122:52.70]Sorry, Ned.
[122:53.26]I forgot about our anniversary.
[122:55.24]It's not like I'm in traffic on the way home.
[122:57.26]Oh, that's right!
[122:58.34]Shit!
[122:58.82]Our anniversary!
[123:00.35]I'm coming right home!
[123:01.33]No, Ned, I'm in Iceland.
[123:03.45]And I'll see you in two weeks.
[123:07.65]Uh-oh.
[123:08.13]He's pissed.
[123:27.52]Do you like gasoline?
[123:29.00]Alright.
[123:29.60]Gasoline.
[123:30.06]Alright, let's go.
[123:30.91]Yeah, no shit.
[124:01.43]Cool.
[124:01.73]Let's go.
[124:02.01]I'm on the... Why is there a magic cave?
[124:04.83]Use your phone.
[124:33.67]Are you kidding me?
[124:38.17]I came all the way out here for no reason.
[124:49.79]What year do I think this is?
[124:52.21]Um, I don't know.
[124:54.59]Somewhere post-2010?
[124:55.69]This isn't supposed to be, like, the early 2000s.
[125:15.61]Drive to Ned's house.
[125:18.51]This takes place in like 2014 or something.
[125:20.42]Alright, I need a flashlight.
[125:23.22]What is this sketch piece?
[125:30.74]The number 86 was carved into the mast.
[125:33.71]Learning about the ship.
[125:34.69]Alright, let's go back in here.
[125:40.23]He could have gone left there.
[125:41.41]Oh, I thought somebody was just making a joke because like the cave on the left thing.
[125:45.28]I actually do have a name, you know.
[125:47.24]It's Nancy.
[125:48.92]This is the 32nd Nancy Drew game.
[125:55.04]It's all hands-on deck for the lunch rush.
[125:57.60]Wait, cooking segment?
[125:59.48]I'm a sleuth, not a chef.
[126:01.36]Are you sure you want me back there handling the sharp stuff?
[126:05.18]Why does every Nancy Drew game have cooking food in it?
[126:08.90]Well, might as well take a stab at it.
[126:18.49]Oh my god.
[126:20.89]This is not cooking.
[126:23.33]Fill the parameter tray according to the order.
[126:26.17]Where they eat penguins?
[126:29.30]They eat penguins and... All requests must be filled though some compartments may be empty.
[126:35.64]Orders can be filled in one of two ways.
[126:37.16]Across a row.
[126:40.50]And in a Z shape within a colored tiny group.
[126:43.96]When checking whether an order is complete, empty spaces don't count.
[126:46.54]I don't know what this is telling me.
[126:49.11]All requests must be filled, though some compartments can be empty.
[126:58.53]They can go in a Z shape.
[127:01.77]When checking whether an order is complete, empty spaces don't count.
[127:05.57]Remember that each row in each colored tray group counts as one order.
[127:11.83]And must contain no extra items.
[127:13.55]The row below has an extra Lundi so it doesn't meet the order requirements.
[127:17.65]When all orders are fulfilled, you will receive any remaining tips.
[127:20.45]Choose to make a new order.
[127:21.39]What do you mean that's not a penguin?
[127:26.47]Is it like molded up ice cream to look like a penguin?
[127:28.75]I don't understand.
[127:29.17]What are you talking about?
[127:33.97]Fill the... Okay.
[127:36.84]Time to get to work.
[127:39.08]Lax, Lundi, and Hakarl.
[127:45.03]So the first order is a one order of... Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.
[127:52.76]One order of that and then... Okay, order done.
[128:01.60]Uh... Then... Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[128:08.47]I'm doing it.
[128:09.09]I'm going.
[128:09.47]Alright.
[128:13.01]New order.
[128:13.79]Get it out.
[128:14.37]Ship it out of here.
[128:17.93]Did I do it faster?
[128:18.89]Oh, I... No, no, no.
[128:24.47]I can't do it faster than that.
[128:25.64]This is too confusing.
[128:27.40]Just doing Zs.
[128:28.16]Only Zs.
[128:28.50]I don't care.
[128:32.52]Uh...

[129:52.71]What are you... I have no idea what he's doing, and neither do I. I have no idea what's going on.
[130:00.52]I thought I was going to be flipping pancakes.
[130:06.76]Why would you put me back here?
[130:08.38]I don't know what any...
[130:11.79]That one looked really easy.
[130:13.64]Wait.
[130:13.94]Hold on.
[130:14.26]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[130:16.16]Shit.
[130:16.38]Wait, wait.
[130:16.85]Okay, this one looks... No.
[130:18.03]This one looks easy.
[130:42.67]Shit!
[130:58.36]How do I fix this?
[131:05.62]I need two and then one.
[131:08.56]I'm confused.
[131:09.26]Uh...
[131:12.26]It can be in a Z. Or a cross, or... A cross has to be... I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[131:28.71]I got it.
[131:30.81]This is... Then we need... A... This one here has to be... Done?
[131:39.89]Now this one, the top one.
[131:40.69]What's the top one?
[131:41.23]Top one is...
[131:46.19]Oh, goddammit.
[131:46.99]Give me a break.
[131:51.79]This is the easiest thing ever.
[131:54.09]It's not the easiest thing ever.
[132:09.51]I need to get that there.
[132:14.40]I can't move because it has to...
[132:21.13]I wish I could pick it up and didn't... Oh, you motherfucker.
[132:24.84]Why does it... I'm trying to pick this one up.
[132:28.38]Why is it giving me like a ton of them?
[133:05.15]It's the same fucking thing!
[133:07.41]Alright, if I flip these... I would love to flip these, so we gotta do... Sheep on left?
[133:21.81]What do you mean on left?
[133:26.10]Put a bad review on Yelp.
[133:29.28]Fix the bottom row.
[133:36.06]I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't!
[133:38.46]There's not enough spaces!
[133:39.94]There's not enough spaces!
[133:59.04]Switch the rows.
[134:11.35]No, that's not correct.
[134:12.60]I... Get me the fuck out of here.
[134:19.68]Speak up now.
[134:23.91]Elizabeth said you threatened Magnus pretty directly.
[134:27.49]I did.
[134:28.31]It was... How do you call it?
[134:31.00]Friendship.
[134:33.67]Friendship?
[134:34.15]That's friendship to you?
[134:35.49]What are you on about?
[134:36.37]I threaten everyone.
[134:38.05]It still seems a little strange.
[134:40.49]Spoken by a woman with no friends.
[134:43.95]Hey, I have friends and I have a boyfriend who I am ditching to be here talking to you.
[134:49.23]My friends are back in the U.S.
[134:51.75]They don't like Iceland?
[134:53.32]Don't like cold?
[134:54.52]What?
[134:55.30]I think they're in school right now.
[134:58.04]School.
[134:59.50]Okay, Gunner.
[135:00.67]Okay, uh... Does this dickhead not understand that it's thousands of dollars to travel across the world?
[135:07.83]How can you expect... How can you expect, like, a 19-year-old to have, like, $4,700 in their bank account to, like, come to Iceland for fun right now?
[135:14.90]What are you talking about?
[135:23.98]You spend a lot of time in the pub, don't you?
[135:26.48]Why?
[135:27.38]What kind of a question is that?
[135:29.80]Am I a lonely little man sitting in the pub crying over a tiny place of pretty viscous ink about all the women I've ever lost and writing it all down in some wimpy little notebook?
[135:41.33]No!
[135:42.29]Then I would be Magnus.
[135:45.00]Me.
[135:46.18]I am a mountain wolf.
[135:48.28]I roam the wilds and I keep my own company.
[135:52.22]I am a predator.
[135:55.95]Did you go to the festival?
[135:56.99]Is this your hook?
[135:58.52]For you?
[136:01.88]Not everyone else.
[136:03.70]Scrambling around for hidden treasure?
[136:06.02]Embarrassing.
[136:06.82]When I was all young, we fought over things like longest fish and shiniest boat.
[136:13.17]Not gold.
[136:14.29]Ever since that sword took over the festival running, it's been straight to the bottom with it.
[136:22.92]Did Magnus ever say anything about a treasure chest that you may have found?
[136:30.28]Did Magnus ever say anything about the treasure?
[136:32.76]Hey Lazy Purple, thanks for the raid.
[136:34.98]Welcome everybody.
[136:39.85]Welcome to the fucking stream.
[136:47.51]Yeah, somebody, look, somebody raided me and like, I'm just being, I'm being fucking weird because now it's a year in my head.
[136:53.03]Because every time somebody raided before, I would be like, hey, what's up guys?
[136:56.30]Not now.
[136:56.80]See, I'm like fucked up.
[136:58.16]So you don't want to watch this stream, right?
[137:00.74]Link the slap.
[137:01.26]Look, I hit myself in the face sometimes.
[137:02.98]See?
[137:03.16]Thanks.
[137:05.15]Welcome.
[137:13.78]Welcome to the worst stream ever.
[137:14.92]You paid... Oh, the worst stream ever.
[137:16.34]You paid channel points to say that, which means you've been sitting here for at least, like, 67 minutes.
[137:20.13]What happened to you?
[137:20.81]Did you do this?
[137:25.55]Did you make these...
[137:42.18]did I get 750 from did I find it on the ground alright 86 I need to find out more look at this is definitely a puzzle can I get some puzzles
[138:04.07]No.
[138:05.45]Needing to know what masts and sails on boats are is not a puzzle.
[138:12.00]That's information.
[138:13.72]I want a puzzle.
[138:15.72]Not info.
[138:22.70]I gotta learn more about the ship.
[138:26.06]I need a flashlight.
[138:32.55]Can I go in?
[138:33.09]Let's go over here.
[138:34.99]You got any new info for me?
[138:38.56]You, do you have anything?
[138:39.32]Like, what about these sketches?
[138:42.25]I didn't think it was possible to be this cold.
[138:45.70]Thanks for showing me that I need to up the price on that to like five thousand.
[139:14.91]This is good data I'm collecting.
[139:19.37]Here, do you want this?
[139:21.08]Sorry, can't talk.
[139:22.82]Need heat.
[139:23.76]Teeth freezing into tiny icicles.
[139:25.28]Go inside.
[139:25.96]Fix the heater.
[139:26.56]There's no heater outside.
[139:27.52]What are you talking about?
[139:28.34]The pub's around the corner.
[139:29.73]You could always go inside.
[139:31.63]Or you could fix the heater.
[139:33.31]Gee, I wonder which of us will cave first.
[139:35.82]What are you talking about?
[139:38.38]So we're going to do this middle management style.
[139:40.30]That is, you do the work and I supervise.
[139:43.51]Each of those circuit pieces will attach anywhere on this board, but there are special numbers you've got to watch out for.
[139:48.99]Covered numbers add together to give that piece a total value.
[139:52.59]If you can use all five pieces to hit all five target values, the heater will be fixed.
[139:57.58]Who made this like this?
[139:59.34]Are you sure I don't have to tighten a valve or find a valve under a mat and then screw it onto here?
[140:04.76]I... So we need to have...
[140:25.56]If you know this much, why haven't you tried to fix it yet?
[140:28.70]Hey, if I had to do all the hard thinking around here, you'd be out of a job.
[140:32.16]So where'd you come from?
[140:33.36]The United States.
[140:35.28]Hey, me too.
[140:36.90]Where in the US?
[140:38.34]South.
[140:40.06]South.
[140:40.62]I just like to get to know you a little.
[140:42.50]I went to school, and then I had a job, and then I was married, and then I wasn't.
[140:47.51]And now I have another job involving definitely legal treasure hunting activities.
[140:52.67]That's me.
[140:53.59]Dude, I just smoked this.
[140:55.51]Anyone who isn't paying me.
[140:56.83]Dude, I just, I fucking smoked it.
[140:57.85]If you want to write me a check, I can tell you a sad backstory and we both can pretend it's real.
[141:02.43]Sorry, I left my checkbook at the lodge.
[141:05.87]Maybe next time then.
[141:06.69]Get smoked.
[141:07.35]I mean, are you an open book with every stranger who crosses your path?
[141:11.07]Place it.
[141:11.79]No, I guess I don't like to talk about myself much either.
[141:15.54]What's your jam?
[141:16.96]Witness protection program?
[141:18.68]Arch nemesis?
[141:19.82]None of those.
[141:20.78]I guess it's that I meet so many interesting people, I just feel...
[141:25.00]ordinary by comparison that was the strangest wiring panel I've ever seen but I think the heat's on you're electrocuting her
[141:33.33]Toasty.
[141:34.46]Feels just like home.
[141:36.56]By the by, have you been up to Magnus' cabin yet?
[141:39.16]He has a cabin?
[141:40.14]Up in the hill?
[141:41.74]Up in the hill?
[141:42.34]Elizabeth keeps a key in her bag.
[141:43.86]Talk about refusing to let go.
[141:45.88]But there's no way she'd ever give it to you.
[141:47.88]I need to find another way to get in there.
[141:49.64]I need to find a way to get her off that deck.
[141:52.82]If I were you, I'd get a little sneaky about it.
[141:57.24]I need to know who has a... I found a radio, but I need a key to turn it.
[142:03.18]Can I borrow your key?
[142:03.74]I found a radio on board, but I need a key to turn it on.
[142:06.76]Can I borrow yours?
[142:08.33]Here you go.
[142:08.85]I wonder what minigame it is to kick her off the deck.
[142:12.27]Hey, that was easy.
[142:13.51]It's called Against the Ropes, Jump Two Feet Forward.
[142:18.05]I don't have radio experience.
[142:20.11]Land on Stomach.
[142:22.79]Figures.
[142:23.63]Well, thanks anyway.
[142:28.48]I got the key.
[142:29.77]Bye-bye.
[142:30.99]Bye now.
[142:33.99]Nice, the heater works.
[142:36.33]Check out the cabin outside of town.
[142:38.49]Find a light... Haven't done that.
[142:40.09]Haven't done that.
[142:41.17]Alright, I got the radio key.
[142:42.39]Let's go check out the radio.
[142:49.60]Drew crew.
[142:53.08]Ooh, what's this?
[142:54.70]Who knows?
[142:59.82]Another... something else fucked up.
[143:03.54]I can't do anything with it.
[143:09.12]Hey, can I get a... just to see who's here?
[143:10.67]I just need to know.
[143:12.41]One in the chat, if you're part of the Druid crew, I need to know.
[143:14.35]It's important to me.
[143:24.72]Where am I going?
[143:27.34]I'm like in the basement.
[143:29.40]Where am I going?
[143:32.12]What?
[143:39.26]Somebody just said, fuck the Dru crew?
[143:40.80]Alright, dude.
[143:43.78]Okay, man.
[143:45.88]Wow.
[143:52.27]Sure.
[143:53.65]Can you believe what somebody just said?
[143:56.82]I can't believe somebody said that.
[144:00.10]That's disgusting behavior.
[144:01.50]It's disgusting to me that somebody said that.
[144:06.54]I can do the battery.
[144:17.48]Wait.
[144:19.49]Turn around.
[144:20.63]Can I go in any of these rooms?
[144:21.47]I can go in this one.
[144:24.55]Alright, this is the captain's room.
[144:28.74]Each row column contains exactly two of each toy.
[144:33.99]No, not one of these.
[144:35.59]Both puffins are to the right of both dogs.
[144:37.77]No adjacent toys of the same kind.
[144:40.01]No ponies in the left half of the cupboard.
[144:43.05]Both dogs are somewhere to the left of both puffins.
[144:45.25]The puffins are between the ponies.
[144:46.53]The dogs are adjacent.
[144:51.05]Ooh, what's that?
[144:51.93]A locator.
[144:56.65]Here's your puzzle.
[144:57.37]This is not a puzzle!
[144:58.21]Fill in the three squares to complete the sequence used in each of the rows.
[145:30.83]One, two, I don't know, three?
[145:34.55]Three, two, one, three, two plus three is five.
[145:37.13]I don't know, three and one, and then two +2 is four.
[145:56.66]What about, does the color mean anything?
[146:00.94]One to the two to the two to the three That's just one two three No, it's two to the one to the one to the three What's somebody going to what does that sound is somebody in the bathroom
[146:34.95]That was weird.
[146:37.69]What's the solution?
[146:38.29]I don't care.
[146:39.75]This is not even puzzles.
[146:42.25]These are... Alright, I'm going to say it.
[146:43.63]And I don't like even... I don't like saying this.
[146:47.46]I don't like saying this.
[146:48.26]I'm going to say it though.
[146:50.24]I'm going to say it.
[146:51.40]This is like... This is a boomer puzzle because this is like the shit that they do in a newspaper.
[146:55.30]This is a newspaper puzzle.
[146:56.92]This is not find who the murderer is or unravel the mystery.
[147:00.44]This is open up page 16 of a newspaper.
[147:04.92]This is... Come on.
[147:10.50]You should be good at it then.
[147:11.78]Read the newspaper.
[147:14.02]I don't like the way that it feels.
[147:15.24]I don't like how it feels in my hands.
[147:16.52]It's like weird and sandy and crusty and dry.
[147:20.24]I don't like it.
[147:20.58]I hate it.
[147:20.86]Okay, those of you that don't get it.
[147:29.26]Next time you have a newspaper on your person...
[147:33.11]Just, like, open it and, like, take and grab and, like, slide your fingers up and down it and touch it.
[147:38.11]Grab it.
[147:38.69]It's dry and gross and fucking... I hate the way it feels.
[147:42.91]I fucking hate it.
[147:43.79]I hate it so much.
[147:45.41]Thinking about holding and turning and sliding and grabbing a newspaper makes me want to... It's the worst.
[147:50.92]It's like nails on a chalkboard.
[147:54.28]Just give me the solution.
[147:56.30]What is it?
[148:00.11]All rows add up to 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[148:02.42]All rows add up to 9.
[148:03.22]Thanks for that.
[148:03.60]Appreciate it.
[148:04.60]5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[148:04.84]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[148:05.12]2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[148:05.28]So it actually was 2 to the 3 to the 6, 7, 8, 9.
[148:07.54]Yeah, it was 2 to the 3 to the 1.
[148:23.35]six seven eight nine three four five six seven eight nine five six seven eight nine wait one five six seven eight nine one two three six seven eight nine six seven eight nine what do you that's not working
[148:55.49]Does this row meet... Hold on, wait.
[148:58.53]6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 3.
[149:01.46]Colors at the top.
[149:04.04]And what the hell does that matter?
[149:05.54]Does it have to be 3 in each row?
[149:08.84]So 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[149:09.36]2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[149:09.64]Uh...
[149:21.98]It has to be four red and three yellow.
[149:24.08]Okay, so that's one that's six, seven, eight, nine.
[149:26.08]I don't think that's correct.
[149:42.92]Three, not two.
[149:44.52]Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[149:49.08]Why is it five?
[149:54.27]Another key.
[149:54.73]How many keys do we have?

[150:06.88]Magnus just saved games from the newspaper.
[150:09.12]He was gonna do this later.
[150:10.94]This has nothing to do with anything.
[150:25.48]You think it does.
[150:26.90]But it doesn't.
[150:30.56]Okay.
[150:31.87]Uh... Clue.

[174:52.11]Pro bar.
[174:54.27]Pro bar.
[175:01.72]more clues haven't done that what else is in here oh a suitcase can you pet dog in Nancy Drew shadow on the ocean yes they look really happy who is this
[175:32.49]Still have to find clues for this shit.
[175:34.77]I better find some pins first.
[175:36.39]Wait.
[175:37.81]This is, um... Isn't this it?
[175:42.75]No?
[175:43.81]Hold up the piece of paper.
[175:50.09]Pins?
[175:52.43]Where do I get pins?
[175:59.09]Those cities are one-letter names?
[176:07.21]Yeah, I can't wait to go to G. Who leaked this?
[176:14.46]Have you been running your mouth?
[176:15.92]I hope you realize it's going to take a lot of dough to make this disappear.
[176:21.37]Iceland government reports big treasure to be found.
[176:23.51]Alright, where are the pins?
[176:33.06]I'm apparently still not done in this office.
[176:51.28]I guess not Let's go talk shit She's not here anymore I got a lot of stuff Jerma can you pass the cereal box?
[177:13.76]No
[177:15.82]You guys remember when I was gonna do the stream?
[177:18.32]Where I bought a shitload of cereal boxes and we did all the activities on... Just put the cam on.
[177:29.93]And then I had... I realized... That you... That would be so horrible.
[177:41.22]Because what I would... What I actually would end up doing...
[177:44.79]I would have 20, 30 plus cereal boxes in this room.
[177:50.49]And I would be drawn on them and shit.
[177:54.51]And then I'm thinking, what am I going to do with this much cereal?
[177:58.23]And I could only donate it to like a food pantry?
[178:05.25]Then that makes sense.
[178:06.31]But then all the boxes would be wicked fucked up.
[178:10.13]And I was like, maybe I could take the bags out.
[178:12.56]Right?
[178:12.80]Like, take the bags out and just keep the boxes and then recycle the boxes.
[178:17.66]And then donate the bags.
[178:20.68]Would that make sense?
[178:24.12]Just put labels on the bags?
[178:29.81]Do you think they would care if you did the puzzles on the box?
[178:33.97]Well, no.
[178:34.41]But, I mean, I don't know.
[178:36.81]It's... I don't know.
[178:37.87]It might be, like, messy.
[178:40.25]What if I, like, mess up and I get angry and I'm like, like, stab the box a bunch of times, he's fucking mad!
[178:48.14]And everyone laughs.
[178:49.86]You know what I'm saying?
[178:58.68]I need batteries for my flashlight.
[179:02.44]Wait, let's go check on a couple things here.
[179:04.44]Let's go talk to you.
[179:05.54]I got some shit to tell you.
[179:08.94]uh I need to know some things who was present at the time of the festival raging at a cereal box who else did you see only gunner Elizabeth and soren were thoroughly mia although half of Iceland is probably related to itself so people kind of look alike gonna miss something
[179:28.50]How'd you meet Magnus?
[179:30.24]I heard about the rumor of the treasure through my connections.
[179:32.98]Then I approached him.
[179:34.62]He's a hard guy to pin down, that Max.
[179:36.02]You could grind up all the cereal and glue it to your hair.
[179:37.44]Turns out he's been looking for the treasure for years.
[179:39.57]I just happened to come in at an opportune moment.
[179:43.63]What would Magnus do with a treasure?
[179:45.69]Why would he do that?
[179:46.15]Desperately wants to buy his own ship.
[179:48.05]True?
[179:48.59]Not true.
[179:49.31]He's a ship guy.
[179:49.91]That makes no sense.
[179:50.75]Ship guys are like that.
[179:53.05]So the ship he helped rebuild isn't his?
[179:56.09]We funded it, but it's town property.
[180:01.44]How long were you working on that ship project?
[180:04.95]About two years.
[180:06.15]On and off of it.
[180:07.39]Magnus supervised the rebuild.
[180:09.23]I provided the cash.
[180:10.92]That's a long time to hang around in Iceland.
[180:13.42]Have you been in Skipbrot all that time?
[180:15.40]No.
[180:17.58]I think the locals would have offed me by now if that were the case.
[180:20.40]I don't like to stay in one place for too long.
[180:22.30]She's not quite 30 FPS.
[180:23.54]If you stay in one place, people start to need you and feel things about you and all that icky, weird stuff.
[180:30.93]I'm not really the having friends type.
[180:33.67]I'd like to think you and I are on friendly terms.
[180:36.61]What is this?
[180:37.45]Are we going to hold hands and sing campfire songs now?
[180:40.49]I don't want to do it.
[180:41.33]Get lost, Drew.
[180:41.91]Find my gold.
[180:43.41]Later.
[180:44.17]I want- I want to like every- I can't say this because people will want me to do it.
[180:50.08]And it's gonna annoy the fuck out of like half the people here.
[180:52.42]They really will.
[180:54.12]People will be- people will just leave and shit.
[180:57.38]Like whatever.
[180:58.04]I want to just like play like loud party music and put an echo in my voice every five minutes and like be like, Where's the Drew crew?
[181:09.45]Just to make sure you guys are still watching, but of course you are.
[181:16.24]Like where's the drew crew at the club?
[181:18.65]Like we're at the club.
[181:19.79]I don't know.
[181:20.21]Do you have any batteries in here?
[181:24.81]Hi.
[181:30.62]Do you have anything that might help with me?
[181:31.56]Do you have anything which might help with my investigation?
[181:34.38]Hmm.
[181:35.13]If I'm not in town, I'm always locked up in here.
[181:37.47]I do have some very nice pamphlets, though.
[181:40.43]The pamphlet lover's journal rated them a nine star out of ten.
[181:44.67]I put them together myself.
[181:46.61]Here's one for your troubles.
[181:49.07]Give me!
[181:49.45]Well, it's hard to turn down an award-winning pamphlet.
[181:52.15]Voltage?
[181:52.85]I'll see if I can make use of this.
[181:55.13]oh okay ding dingies hey sailors did you know every year in Iceland roughly 0.8 out of every 100 000 citizens die of drowning how does 80 of you drown what one per well I don't get that or approximately 2.6 wait what because modern science has not made it possible to save six tenths of a person from drowning caution while out in the seas can be the most important factor in saving a life it's an average oh
[182:28.13]Know your motor.
[182:28.87]Proper voltage must be flowing to jumpstart a broken motor.
[182:32.53]As a handy guy, remember these standard recommended voltages.
[182:35.91]16, 9.
[182:35.95]19, 13.
[182:38.01]Ooh.
[182:41.53]Utila hooks.
[182:42.25]Scraping barnacles.
[182:44.13]Easy pancake flipping.
[182:45.75]Threatening political dissenters.
[182:49.71]Hmm.
[182:55.00]You're kind of a psycho.
[182:55.74]Alright.
[182:57.36]I sense some bad blood between you and Gunner.
[182:59.54]I sense some bad blood between you and Gunner.
[183:02.36]It's more like Gunner dumping bad blood onto me repeatedly while laughing.
[183:07.42]I try to be patient given his history, but what a Neanderthal that one.
[183:13.16]I can't reason with a man who only speaks fist.
[183:17.52]Between you and me, he's never been the same since that terrible crash years ago.
[183:22.41]Didn't a boat just crash?
[183:23.41]Crash?
[183:24.19]I don't know that it's my place to speak of it.
[183:25.83]How long ago did the boat crash?
[183:26.49]But his boat sank to the bottom of the bay, and he hasn't sailed since.
[183:30.41]Now he stays locked up in that pub of his.
[183:35.38]So you attended the festival, right?
[183:38.32]Present and accounted for, naturally.
[183:41.56]Interesting.
[183:42.66]Dagny says you weren't there.
[183:44.40]Why would she lie about that?
[183:45.20]I was up in old Stulka.
[183:46.76]Manning the controls for our audio.
[183:48.90]That's the tower right outside this center.
[183:51.14]Mind if I take a look?
[183:51.76]People very rarely look up, I've found, which is a shame.
[183:55.39]Lots of nifty things in that direction.
[184:00.07]Mind if I take a look?
[184:01.13]Later.
[184:02.23]Bye now.
[184:03.59]The Bitcoin crash?
[184:05.81]Hey, Soren, can I use some of this gift wrap?
[184:08.29]Yes.
[184:09.33]Great.
[184:10.25]How about a magic egg?
[184:11.96]That would be fun to get.
[184:14.46]Oh, I guess it's gonna... Alright, it's the... Okay, I hope somebody wants this.
[184:20.97]I need batteries.
[184:26.57]I'll need to earn some money first.
[184:28.96]I'll need to earn some money first.
[184:31.30]Do I actually have to go do the language things?
[184:33.92]Is that the only way to make money?
[184:36.78]Batteries.
[184:38.48]I can afford that.
[184:40.21]Get them in the... Get them in!
[184:42.97]Alright, I got a flashlight.
[184:43.73]Let's go to the cave.
[184:48.05]Buy the sword.
[184:48.71]I don't have any money to buy the sword.
[184:49.98]Not yet.
[184:59.73]Sword or riot?
[185:01.13]You don't have to riot.
[185:01.91]I'll be fine.
[185:03.91]Alright, this is where it gets scary.
[185:15.68]It belongs to the icebreaker.
[185:25.45]The local town in Iceland's favorite professional wrestler.
[185:47.52]What?
[185:49.48]Is somebody in the ice?
[185:53.63]What's in the ice?
[185:56.85]Dean?
[185:57.25]Dingus?
[185:58.07]No.
[185:58.37]I don't know why.
[185:59.59]Okay.
[186:02.17]What's in there?
[186:07.47]I'm going to need to melt this eventually.
[186:09.03]There's nothing here.
[186:19.52]What about this?
[186:19.84]This looks suspicious.
[186:24.58]These rocks?
[186:25.34]No, what was the point of even coming in here?
[186:26.54]I have to go back to the captain's quarters.
[186:30.34]Apparently I missed something.
[186:37.13]I got this toy bullshit.
[186:38.49]The locator.
[186:39.23]I did get the radio key.
[186:41.61]Let me go up there.
[186:45.65]Oh, she's back.
[186:48.21]Hey, yo, what's up?
[186:49.19]Can I help?
[186:50.45]Yep.
[186:53.62]What's behind the door?
[186:54.54]So, what's behind the mystery door?
[186:59.04]Just an old broom closet.
[187:00.50]Can I see?
[187:01.26]No.
[187:03.40]Not even a hint?
[187:04.84]Go away.
[187:08.91]Hey, Nancy.
[187:12.39]I spend a lot of time out here.
[187:14.19]Don't you have somewhere else to be?
[187:17.13]Can you tell me about the festival's sound system?
[187:19.79]It's been broken for a week.
[187:21.29]Sorin told me he was manning the sound system on the morning the Helichide crashed.
[187:25.88]What?
[187:26.68]But that's not possible.
[187:28.36]There was no sound that day.
[187:30.16]Sounds like we've got an alibi that doesn't quite match up.
[187:33.40]Either you're lying or he is.
[187:34.92]And I'll find out.
[187:37.21]Is there anything more you haven't told me about, Magnus?
[187:40.71]No.
[187:41.71]Guess you'll have to leave now.
[187:43.23]No sound.
[187:45.80]You know I'm better than anyone.
[187:47.74]I don't believe that for an instant.
[187:49.06]Wait, what?
[187:49.86]Oh, not him.
[187:50.20]She didn't respond to that.
[187:51.52]You know I'm better than anyone.
[188:09.50]He is... ...quiet... ...thoughtful... ...keenly obsessive... ...first over his dog... ...then over his writing... ...then over me... ...then over the ship.
[188:22.34]Why would someone like him be hunting for gold in the first place?
[188:26.07]He has certain...
[188:28.48]he just wants treasure which we go mega LOL mania he desperately wants to leave town leave eastland I thought he was a captain already oh he is but for wealthy people private clients never his own boat never his own destination he dreams of living like the old captains sailing wherever the wind takes his treasure not real I see so the treasure would allow him to fulfill that dream
[188:53.55]It's gonna be an old wooden leg and... some guy's dentures.
[188:55.81]Secret map.
[188:56.13]Yo, dude.
[188:56.33]PogChamp.
[189:16.17]Lines continue across the gap.
[189:17.65]Interesting.
[189:18.81]Numbers appear to show the number of touching sections which have been filled.
[189:23.57]Must find all five pieces to reveal these two.
[189:26.59]Why five?
[189:27.35]Okay.
[189:29.26]Intricate moving... Whatever.
[189:30.54]We're going to get to the bottom of this mess.
[189:33.18]But first...
[189:44.13]Just want to give a quick little check to see to make sure we have those of you that are here with us.
[189:53.69]That are part of a very specific crew.
[190:02.69]I want you... I want you to put... Oh, I gave up on that one.
[190:09.28]I'm not doing that.
[190:10.80]I'll...
[190:16.24]That was like a, eh, nah, not into it.
[190:20.05]Has anyone checked Magnus's cabin?
[190:22.47]No, I wanted to.
[190:25.99]But you didn't or can't?
[190:29.41]Sorin won't let anyone up there.
[190:31.08]I had to get really high energy there and I, nah.
[190:34.42]Can you help me find a way in?
[190:36.74]No, this town takes care of its own.
[190:39.66]Our problems are ours, no one else's.
[190:45.23]Goodbye.
[190:46.43]Bye now.
[190:48.02]I was dancing.
[190:48.76]Wow, he's low energy.
[190:51.76]I'm getting in this fucking door.
[190:53.40]Alright, where's the radio?
[190:57.62]It's up here, right?
[191:06.45]Alright, here's the key to the radio.
[191:15.30]That's a radio, right?
[191:16.10]Where's this radio?
[191:21.00]High energy, low IQ.
[191:23.54]Where's the radio?
[191:28.71]Where's this radio?
[191:35.05]There it is.
[191:35.37]Alright, radio key.
[191:38.75]Turn it.
[191:39.89]Hello?
[191:40.65]Hello?
[191:41.45]Hmm.
[191:42.33]No one's there.
[191:44.47]Madness, is that you?
[191:45.69]Guess again.
[191:46.33]Uh-oh.
[191:47.55]Who is this?
[191:48.73]Wait, I can explain.
[191:49.95]I didn't know he was going to go missing, and okay, so I haven't filled out all the daily logs for the guy in months, and yes, okay, so I napped through all of the training videos, but I didn't mean to, and I guess what I'm saying is please don't fire me.
[191:58.96]Uh, I'm not here to fire you.
[192:01.44]You're under investigation now for the murder of... Nope.
[192:03.86]Oh, man, that's a relief.
[192:05.58]Well, then.
[192:06.02]Is his name Ken?
[192:06.84]Why did I want to say Ken?
[192:08.66]Operator Alex Lintrong speaking.
[192:10.66]Hi, Alex.
[192:11.50]I'm Nancy.
[192:15.10]Hi, I'm Nancy.
[192:15.80]I'm a detective trying to find out more.
[192:17.14]No, no, no, no, no.
[192:18.36]You don't go... You don't... I'm... Wait, don't I legally have to say I'm a cop?
[192:23.53]Do I have to be like... Before I say anything, I have to be like, oh, that's great.
[192:26.85]By the way, I'm a detective with... Do I have to say that?
[192:38.77]You legally have to.
[192:40.19]You legally have to say, I'm a police officer.
[192:42.13]By the way, here's the rest of my sentence.
[192:45.09]That's just movie shit.
[192:52.76]Why am I saying that cops are like a vampire?
[192:56.06]Wait, hold on a minute.
[193:00.50]If the cop comes to your door, and they say, can we come in?
[193:06.08]If you invite him in,
[193:08.25]Hold on.
[193:08.81]I don't know these laws.
[193:12.56]All I know about police is through television.
[193:16.24]Does a cop have to announce they are a cop to you?
[193:21.90]Does it have to happen?
[193:26.92]Do cops have to tell you that they are a cop?
[193:31.60]No.
[193:32.58]This is perfectly legal in most jurisdictions.
[193:34.92]Your question repeats one that is often asked as people for some reason assume that dishonesty by a police officer should always lead to a dismissal.
[193:42.25]It is only police tactics that could deprive you of some constitutional right that would lead to suppression of evidence in a subsequent dismissal.
[193:49.45]It's not entrapment.
[193:53.97]Entrapment does not simply mean that you were tricked into getting caught.
[193:57.50]Entrapment means that the police persuaded you to commit a crime you had no intention of committing at the outset.
[194:03.66]In your case, you intended to buy drugs all along.
[194:06.62]You didn't just intend to get caught.
[194:08.68]There's no... Wait, what?
[194:14.43]You aren't a police officer.
[194:16.83]Why?
[194:17.09]I'm a detective.
[194:23.40]I'm a vampire.
[194:24.22]You shouldn't have done that.
[194:26.02]Well, like, you know, like, okay.
[194:28.36]I am a person outside your door.
[194:30.90]Yes, who is it?
[194:33.50]I'm a cop.
[194:34.66]I'm a vampire.
[194:36.27]Can we come in?
[194:36.91]Um, no, thank you.
[194:39.39]How does it... Vampire cop.
[194:50.23]I'm...
[194:52.14]Come back with a warrant, vampire.
[194:53.52]Vampire's just like, can I come in?
[194:55.12]I just want to take a look around, but you gotta invite me in first.
[194:58.94]Come back with a warrant.
[195:00.26]Okay.
[195:00.58]I'll come back with a warrant.
[195:23.22]go back to that life.
[195:24.48]Alex, slow down and stay calm.
[195:27.33]I need your help.
[195:28.67]If what you're saying is true, Magnus might be in serious danger.
[196:09.63]Why would you write that?
[196:17.10]Alright, I'm back.
[196:30.73]I'm back with my warrant.
[196:53.34]I'm back Can I come in?
[197:00.32]Fuck, I put more on He's fucked up again
[197:20.70]The judge gets to the... The judge gets... That's been notarized.
[197:28.46]Can you imagine if that's how you had to notarize documents?
[197:32.75]This is the way that you notarize documents.
[197:37.41]Yeah, I need to get this bank statement notarized.
[197:40.39]Oh, just one moment, sir.
[197:43.05]Okay, there you are.
[197:44.16]Ay-yi-yi.
[197:58.63]That's just the official... Okay, let's go.
[198:03.96]But you don't have to handle this alone.
[198:06.04]I... Okay, I heard Magnus calling in early morning, same as always, just to say hi around 6.
[198:14.22]Then we started chatting, just like we always do.
[198:16.86]He was excited about the ship he was pirating.
[198:19.70]He said it was his bait.
[198:20.88]He started pulling into Skipwrought Harbor.
[198:23.23]I heard a voice.
[198:24.29]Kim is gonna be mad.
[198:25.41]I'm not using that much lipstick.
[198:26.35]Is this expensive lipstick?
[198:27.51]I don't even know what it is.
[198:28.69]What brand is it?
[198:29.29]I don't know.
[198:29.63]Uh...
[198:54.75]Okay, this lipstick is called the Countess.
[199:03.38]Countess.
[199:08.84]This vampire lipstick.
[199:15.99]It's 20 bucks.
[199:18.63]Pretty good.
[199:22.39]Could you hear anything Magnus said?
[199:24.43]Something about the ship.
[199:25.39]That's all I got.
[199:26.77]I was too scared.
[199:27.59]I hope he's okay.
[199:30.79]Who are you, by the way?
[199:32.01]Just a lowly undergrad assigned to a cubicle, a pair of headphones, and a computer.
[199:37.28]I'm here on an internship for my maritime psychology degree.
[199:40.80]My parents said I'd never find a paying job.
[199:43.16]Shows them.
[199:43.76]Me and Magnus, we were kind of buddies.
[199:46.11]I mean, we never met or anything, but whenever he'd radio in, he always wanted to chat.
[199:49.77]They just don't know what the color is.
[199:54.55]Alright, are you... You don't sound Icelandic.
[199:57.51]Nope.
[199:58.07]Massachusetts.
[200:00.10]So, what are you doing here?
[200:01.72]No, no, no, no, no.
[200:02.94]Those of you that are saying... Oh, wow.
[200:05.72]Really?
[200:06.02]I'm gonna laugh.
[200:06.90]Pink.
[200:07.52]Red.
[200:07.86]No.
[200:10.63]No.
[200:12.25]You don't understand.
[200:15.21]There are like four or five thousand different red shades of lipstick that have different names.
[200:24.22]It's like Willy Wonka, guys.
[200:29.51]It's not just pink.
[200:32.29]No.
[200:42.01]Schnozberry red.
[200:43.31]That's what I'm saying.
[200:47.03]Lipstick colors?
[200:48.05]Seriously, they may as well be Crayola.
[200:49.79]Crayola.
[200:53.83]There's a box of Crayola.
[200:54.79]There's like 5,000 different shades.
[200:57.37]And they all call them different things.
[201:00.25]I need a way to distract someone on board this ship.
[201:03.03]So you can do what exactly?
[201:05.42]Snoop through their stuff.
[201:06.78]Kat Von D lipsticks are very good.
[201:09.12]So she's got a good taste.
[201:10.20]Yeah, I can help.
[201:12.30]What do I do?
[201:12.96]Hold up, Klepto.
[201:14.38]I've got a favor to ask first.
[201:16.12]Okay, name your price.
[201:17.66]There's a light
[201:19.75]Where's the lighthouse?
[201:20.49]Wait, is this actually Kat Von D?
[201:22.65]I don't know!

[202:29.74]I'll tell you some lipstick.
[202:32.07]I don't know why.
[202:32.73]Maybe I do know why.
[202:35.26]There are some lipsticks and glosses that smell like candy and cakes and pudding and stuff.
[202:42.62]And I have come very, very close.
[202:45.18]There's one in particular that all the girls in high school, when I was in high school, they all used this.
[202:52.79]It was this cake batter lip gloss stuff.
[202:57.29]And it smelled like a vanilla, baking vanilla frosting cake thing.
[203:06.14]And I just wanted somebody to put a little bit on my finger and let me just eat it.
[203:10.65]I probably did.
[203:11.13]If I was like, hey, can I, like, could you put like a little bit like on this paper and I can like put my finger on it and eat it?
[203:18.75]Thanks for sub.
[203:19.37]What are you talking about?
[203:26.21]Shokuji, thanks for the subs.
[203:27.99]No, that did happen.
[203:28.89]Thanks for the five community subs.
[203:32.31]You're right.
[203:32.63]That did just happen.
[203:34.21]Why did you say that?
[203:43.06]That lipstick is made from beeswax and whale vomit.
[203:47.74]Get the fuck out of here.
[203:50.61]What is lipstick?
[203:52.35]It's made out of clay or something.
[203:54.11]What is lipstick made out of?
[203:56.61]It's like... It's clay.
[204:00.35]Wax, clay, whatever.
[204:02.15]Here it is.
[204:05.55]It's made from... Here, look.
[204:11.61]Okay.
[204:13.15]It's made from like fruit pigments.
[204:15.28]Fruit pigment.
[204:17.30]Strawberries are first juiced and then dehydrated into a powder.
[204:20.36]That's pretty cool.
[204:21.44]The powder is then soaked in oil to extract pigments and blended into a mixture of shea and cocoa butter.
[204:26.37]Done.
[204:26.55]Done.
[204:28.72]And then rice starch provides opacity, giving the lipstick long-wearing coverage, right?
[204:35.29]And then candelilla wax from the candelilla plant allows the lipstick to hold its shape.
[204:42.65]And then there it is.
[204:46.47]Yeah, it's made out of clay.
[204:49.58]Then they add the whale vomit.
[204:50.90]Okay, where does it say that?
[204:53.43]Oh, wait, sorry.
[204:54.23]That's one brand of lipstick, like I told you.
[204:56.44]By the way, I said there's like a thousand shades of Crayola for lipstick.
[204:59.42]There's also a thousand Crayola brands of lipstick.
[205:03.72]There's a thousand different boxes of brands of this shit.
[205:06.70]Okay, hold on.
[205:08.04]What is lipstick made of?
[205:09.31]Is lipstick made out of whale sperm?
[205:19.19]What?
[205:22.22]The fuck?
[205:24.15]Is lipstick made out of... Okay, this is ridiculous.

[205:36.84]What animal is lipstick made from?
[205:38.76]Is lipstick made out of bugs?

[206:01.84]Wait.
[206:02.28]Hold on a second.
[206:06.32]I didn't scream.
[206:09.26]Hold on.
[206:10.09]Wait, wait, wait.
[206:10.65]This is the best reveal of the night.
[206:12.29]Are you ready?
[206:14.73]Here comes the best reveal of the night.
[206:21.08]Oh, this is going to be fantastic.
[206:23.34]I can't wait for you to see this.
[206:24.88]Give me one second so I can get it on the screen.
[206:30.19]We're going to slowly go through this.
[206:38.43]I love this so much.
[206:41.95]Why are people searching?
[206:43.27]Does it make any sense?
[206:47.11]Hold on.
[206:47.67]I got it.
[206:48.09]I got it.
[206:48.35]I'm bringing it over.
[206:53.42]What are you talking about?
[206:54.20]Does anybody have no space to save an image?
[207:00.43]What?
[207:01.51]No, okay.
[207:02.03]Wrong drive.
[207:02.47]Alright, here we go.
[207:08.71]I want to make sure that you guys don't get the reveal too quickly because it's fucking ridiculous.
[207:13.08]This is too- What?
[207:14.38]This is- You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[207:17.34]This is so stupid.
[207:18.28]Here we go.
[207:19.98]I need this reveal to be legit.
[207:33.49]You ready?
[207:35.21]This is what you get for searching, what is lipstick made out of?
[207:44.06]Is lipstick made out of bugs?
[207:47.08]Is makeup made out of poop?
[207:49.74]Is there sperm in lip gloss?
[207:52.00]Is there whale poop in makeup?
[207:54.91]Is Maybelline vegan?
[207:57.49]I don't know, interesting.
[207:59.03]Is Fenty Beauty vegan?
[208:03.93]Is Micah safe in lipstick?
[208:07.68]I wonder what the next one might be.
[208:09.36]Yeah.
[208:10.70]Is there bad poop in Doritos?
[208:24.15]Why?
[208:26.42]Why?
[208:30.52]Is there... What makeup has bat poop in it?
[208:37.30]Is there bat poop in lipstick?
[208:42.34]Why wouldn't there be bat poop in Doritos?
[208:48.96]Is there bat poop in Doritos?
[209:01.57]Wait, there's bat shit in Doritos?
[209:03.31]That's real?
[209:05.77]There are common ingredients in many food products called guanine, which sounds and looks a lot like guano.
[209:11.85]Another term is guanylate, which comes from guanylic acid, which is an active ingredient in Doritos.
[209:18.91]This term is also confused as being a root derivative of the term bat feces.
[209:24.83]But it's not.
[209:25.71]It's not.
[209:26.47]Is there bat poop in Doritos?
[209:27.88]Why would that be linked?
[209:37.94]Is that bat poop in energy drinks?
[209:42.46]Everyone, why does everybody think... And then people get even more... People just get curious.
[210:18.19]Why would somebody search for- I don't know.
[210:21.41]I swear to God robots search for stuff.
[210:25.87]It's not possible.
[210:27.67]I guess maybe when you're lying in bed at like 4 in the morning and you're just like- I don't know.
[210:33.60]Alright, we're going to reveal this one too.
[210:44.38]I don't know what it is about this thing in particular.
[210:53.34]What is up with this animal in particular?
[210:55.48]I don't get it.
[210:55.94]Here we go.
[211:01.36]Is sperm made out of poop?
[211:10.57]Okay, here we go.
[211:11.59]Here's the new one.
[211:19.59]Starting us off nicely, we have
[211:24.04]Uh, can I get in there?
[211:26.74]Oh, I think I fucked it up.
[211:28.76]Oh, shit.
[211:29.34]I fucked it up.
[211:30.11]No!
[211:32.23]No!
[211:37.75]Wait.
[211:40.71]Okay, I got it.
[211:46.28]Okay, here we go.
[211:49.00]No, no, no, no, no!
[211:49.56]It's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong!
[211:58.94]God damn it, stop.
[211:59.96]Why is it doing this?
[212:01.04]I'm trying to do the stupid reveal.
[212:13.25]Alright.
[212:15.09]Who cares?
[212:15.77]Here we go.
[212:17.91]Don't do that again.
[212:19.23]You're making me upset.
[212:21.99]Here we go.
[212:24.03]Okay, so is there bat poop in mascara?
[212:27.59]What is bat poop used in?
[212:32.01]Is there bat poop in energy drinks?
[212:37.47]What is with bats?
[212:39.40]Is disodium guano like bat feces?
[212:43.74]It gets better.
[212:46.74]Is bat poop a delicacy?
[212:54.42]Where is guano found?
[212:56.95]And by the way, is it toxic?
[212:59.97]So I can eat it.
[213:03.85]How do you clean up bat poop?
[213:07.22]How do you identify bat poop?
[213:08.94]So I can eat it, make sure it's not poisonous, and then clean it up.
[213:17.42]Look at these.
[213:23.37]This is not me.
[213:24.01]This is other people.
[213:24.75]Somebody else wrote this.
[213:27.74]Can I eat it?
[213:29.30]Where do I find it?
[213:30.84]Will it make me sick?
[213:32.43]How do I clean it up and how do I know where it is?
[213:36.31]In a row.
[213:36.77]I can't.
[213:43.43]I have to play Nancy Drew.
[213:59.79]Let's go.
[214:03.23]What's this image?
[214:04.70]What are you talking about?
[214:09.64]Is it bat poop in the stream?
[214:11.26]I know.
[214:11.52]I've seen that image of my mouth.
[214:15.69]Jesus Christ, guys.
[214:22.27]Why do I keep looking up bat shit?
[214:26.47]I know.
[214:26.75]I've seen it.
[214:27.21]I've seen it.
[214:27.69]I've seen it.
[214:28.59]I've seen it.
[214:29.51]Crayola taste test.
[214:30.77]When?
[214:31.05]Oh my fucking god.
[214:32.87]Is that the super mercenary one?
[214:34.71]Always freezing, kind of sassy?
[214:36.67]Sounds like her.
[214:37.61]She used to call me all the time.
[214:39.65]Always tried to get information about Magnus' plans to come in and out of Harvard.
[214:42.94]I'm not showing that on screen.
[214:43.76]It's going to scare people.
[214:44.50]I'm so disorganized, I can't match my thought colors, let alone keep records of Magnus' charting.
[214:48.80]She always wanted to know when he'd be gone.
[214:50.64]I never told her, obviously.
[214:52.60]What was she trying to do in his absence?
[214:54.94]No clue.
[214:56.03]But I did some internet stalking on her.
[214:58.15]One of my many talents.
[214:59.69]Imagine how fucked up we've gotten as a society.
[215:03.37]Imagine how just fucked up we have become.
[215:10.13]Where you as a person are sitting somewhere and you need to look up if there is bat shit in your food.
[215:23.12]How did we get here?
[215:32.61]I just was curious today.
[215:34.43]Am I eating animal shit?
[215:37.17]I might be.
[215:38.20]That's why I'm concerned to look.
[215:45.52]What did you mean by daily logs earlier?
[215:48.17]There are these logs I'm supposed to fill out whenever a vessel passes through us.
[215:52.30]So are they filled out?
[215:53.76]Kind of.
[215:54.92]I turned one sheet into an homage to my relationship with my mom, another into the super cool drawing of a whale.
[216:00.85]I haven't been keeping tabs on vessels as well as I should be.
[216:04.87]It's better than the old days when you ate that shit versus guessing if it might be trace amounts in your food.
[216:11.51]That is kind of true.
[216:19.66]How cool are we talking?
[216:22.79]I'm not paying attention to any of this.
[216:24.35]I don't even know what's going on.
[216:25.57]I don't have any records of Magnus going through our waters.
[216:28.57]What do you mean my thumbnail?
[216:35.92]Is that actually the thumbnail?
[216:45.39]What do you know about Soren?
[216:47.05]That guy who runs the festival?
[216:48.57]Yes.
[216:49.25]He worked with us a few times.
[216:50.91]Always seems like there's something just under the surface with that one.
[216:53.79]Cheerful and yet angry.
[216:56.03]Or bitter.
[216:57.05]Like he was holding something back.
[216:59.07]Show the link for the VOD.
[217:00.59]Oh my god.
[217:06.80]Who even is this character?
[217:08.06]I don't even know who this is.
[217:16.58]No, that's scary.
[217:18.13]I'm not showing that one.
[217:19.27]You'll have to find that one.
[217:20.69]Is somebody from Monsters Inc?
[217:23.43]No, that one's scary.
[217:24.49]I'm not showing that one.
[217:25.57]It's scary.
[217:26.89]Give me the Monsters Inc one.
[217:32.93]Who is this?
[217:33.53]What character is this?
[217:38.17]What's this character's name?
[217:46.27]What's this character's name?
[217:48.32]It's called Fer... Ferg?
[217:52.12]Fergus?
[217:59.02]That... That's not... When I type, that's not who I get.
[218:04.32]That's not who I get.
[218:05.40]Um... Where... What's...
[218:16.04]What's this, what's this fucking thing's name?
[218:18.72]Monsters Inc.
[218:20.32]Fergie?
[218:20.94]This is not even, there's no people in Monsters Inc.
[218:25.23]called Fergo.
[218:28.89]Ferg, what's this thing's name?
[218:31.81]Fungus.
[218:32.95]What the fuck?
[218:57.86]Show the edit.
[218:58.77]I'm not showing the edit.
[219:07.43]Fungus in the scream extractor.
[219:09.49]What does he do?
[219:10.69]I'm muting this.
[219:11.15]I just want to know who he is.
[219:19.59]I've never seen this movie.
[219:20.39]I don't know what this is.
[219:34.14]Where is he?
[219:36.60]Oh, come on.
[219:42.37]We'll have a latte.
[219:47.65]How did you even... How would you even...
[220:14.55]We have to play after this.
[220:16.16]It's so huge.
[220:16.90]Why is it so big?
[220:23.09]It sucks his lips up.

[221:16.41]Any other information for me?
[221:18.11]Not really.
[221:18.85]Mostly I just kick it in this cubicle and keep my tall ship's lifestyle blog updated.
[221:23.45]It's called Ship Facts.
[221:25.02]Want to hear about it?
[221:27.90]Sure, I guess.
[221:28.64]Sure.
[221:29.42]Educate me.
[221:30.24]Well, sure!
[221:31.04]Ship Facts.
[221:32.30]The forecastle on a ship refers to the upper forward deck of a sailing ship, but it's pronounced folksle.
[221:39.15]Why is that?
[221:40.19]Try pronouncing it like an English sailor with no formal education.
[221:45.34]Please look up more bat shit facts.
[221:51.55]I paid 450 channel points for this, and there are no refunds.
[222:00.50]How about this?
[222:03.12]Before 1865, captains sometimes had difficulty finding people interested in joining their crew.
[222:08.71]Bad shit facts.
[222:09.13]Another shit fact, huh?
[222:09.65]I have a crush on this intern.
[222:10.55]What are you talking about?

[224:54.36]That image is fucked up.
[224:55.40]I know.
[224:55.68]Why do you think I don't want to show it?
[224:57.43]Because it's actually terrifying.
[225:04.55]Yeah?
[225:06.55]Elizabeth seems like she's withholding information.
[225:09.59]She still seems pretty intense about Magnus as far as I can tell.
[225:13.14]And she thinks the treasure belongs to her.
[225:15.72]I've seen some exes do some pretty wild things when they're going through the stages of grief.
[225:21.76]That's why when I end a relationship, I just move to a different continent and change- What?
[225:29.45]Oh, oh!

[237:29.01]That's not a stupid story.
[237:30.18]Is it a dumb story?
[237:31.30]Is this like a made-up story?
[237:36.78]Go outside the town.
[237:37.60]I can't go outside of town!
[237:51.69]Ooh, the cave.
[237:55.33]These caverns can be accessed directly from Skipbro and are open for tours.
[238:11.46]Skip... Okay.
[238:12.86]What does this mean?
[238:15.70]What do I do with this info?
[238:16.48]I don't know.
[238:19.59]You're addicted to Nancy Drew?
[238:22.41]I just want to see the end.
[238:23.86]No, I don't.
[238:24.46]I just want to see, like, halfway through.
[238:27.04]Yeah, I just want to see halfway through.
[238:32.51]This guy got any new info?
[238:38.25]What's your relationship like with Elizabeth?
[238:40.35]Presently, quite poor.
[238:42.09]She won't allow certain members of the restoration team to access their work.
[238:47.67]You mean Dagny?
[238:49.13]Yes, but overall, she's quite a peach, that one.
[238:53.21]The only one who's ever shown me kindness.
[238:56.15]And the other half is happening tomorrow?
[238:57.79]I don't think we're doing two Drew and Crew in a row.

[239:09.42]Want to do it tomorrow?
[239:13.22]AI Dungeon tomorrow?
[239:13.94]Yeah, I guess, sure.
[239:33.72]Well, I guess you could lie about it.
[239:34.88]You said two Druze streams after jump night.
[239:38.94]That's correct still.
[239:40.22]It's less that I'm terrified and more that...
[239:52.52]actually yes I'm terrified in these parts vigilante efforts are very much the norm even if the Nancy Drew dungeon no one would talk I hate to admit it but it's up to us to crack this case that sounds fun bye-bye alright I gotta let me go back to the uh let me go back to the instruments I gotta get that seinfeld theme correct
[240:33.24]Where I'm looking for a, uh... Hold on a minute here.

[241:04.77]How do I open this?
[241:06.21]I think I can open this.
[241:06.99]It should open.
[241:24.40]Why is this not opening?
[241:37.56]Why would it?
[241:38.08]Because I'm cheating and it says I can open it.
[241:40.70]That's a lang spill, right?
[241:44.62]Open the lang spill.
[241:49.81]I can't open it.
[241:58.42]Yeah?
[241:58.86]What about it?

[242:22.98]Nancy doesn't know you can open it.
[242:25.92]What?
[242:32.23]What do you mean Nancy doesn't know you can open it?
[242:42.44]She doesn't know.
[242:43.74]I have to know that?

[244:34.09]Alright, read the letters inside the box.
[244:37.58]Examine the box.
[244:38.72]Nancy says all the wooden sections should be pressed down.
[244:41.74]Inside that box, there's letters in there.
[244:49.47]Let's go.
[244:49.77]Let's go read them.
[244:51.29]You guys live in here?
[244:56.38]Better be.

[245:14.65]I'm not vibing.
[245:16.79]Are you serious?
[245:17.79]What are you talking about?
[245:23.07]You're not vibing.
[245:26.11]I... You're really fucking with my vibe here.
[245:31.13]If you're not vibing.
[245:32.11]You don't know what that means?
[245:38.19]No, you're right, I don't.
[245:39.82]What does it mean?
[245:41.94]I actually don't know what the actual Desmond did.
[245:46.24]Two people are vibing is to say that they are enjoying each other's company and converse easily.
[245:50.04]I was saying it wrong.
[245:52.66]I thought, like, vibing means, like, you were just, like, hanging out and chilling and having a good time.
[245:55.78]I need to get in that bag, too.
[246:13.27]I'm not vibing right now.
[246:17.84]I need to get... I need to read the stupid letters in here.
[246:27.58]Get me the... Okay, where's this dumbass thing?

[253:13.87]So there's my dinghy.
[253:15.43]16, 9, 19, 13.
[253:15.51]I don't have any spark plugs.
[253:34.49]Well, I opened that thing.
[253:35.27]I know what I have to do.
[253:44.99]Hello?
[253:45.15]Are you in front of that lighthouse bulb yet?
[253:47.03]Not quite yet.
[253:47.83]I need your help.
[253:48.47]Then stop calling me, weirdo.
[253:49.89]What?
[253:53.33]Are you in front of that lighthouse bulb yet?
[253:55.31]Not quite yet.
[253:56.13]What the fuck are you talking about?
[253:59.73]Then stop calling me, weirdo.
[254:32.22]Where are the spark plugs, guys?
[254:38.26]Find on page spark plugs.
[254:47.26]I don't care about this.
[254:50.52]I know a guy in the Drew crew saying, like, I don't care.
[254:54.87]I mean, what do you want me to tell you?
[254:58.20]You think I'm gonna walk around in circles to try to find the one place where this is?
[255:06.10]Who the fuck?
[255:07.15]What are you talking about?
[255:15.05]Wait, are they just in there?
[255:17.95]Vote him out of the Drew crew.
[255:19.77]That's fine.
[255:20.45]That's fine.
[255:21.97]You can fire me from president of the Drew crew.
[255:25.63]Whatever.
[255:26.65]I still get to show up.
[255:31.19]Are they just in here?
[255:32.03]Can I not pick them up?
[255:34.45]I have it right here.
[255:35.17]What are you talking about?

[256:18.58]So I can't do it.
[256:23.86]Open the motor.
[256:26.58]Place the spark plugs and connectors in their location.
[256:29.06]I can't even touch it.
[256:33.44]I can't touch this.

[267:04.08]We got 10 and 9. 9.
[267:10.84]What?
[267:11.78]Are you serious?
[267:12.50]10?
[267:14.99]No, it's just... What?

[267:25.05]That's 19.
[267:26.62]And then, I don't know, what's... This is 5?
[267:28.12]What does this one have to be?
[267:29.26]13? 13?
[267:32.87]I am smart.
[267:34.57]We're not toxic.
[267:35.33]There's literally 300,000 people in there.
[267:36.33]And where?
[267:36.63]What?
[267:36.79]Look, look, look.
[267:37.19]I wonder if there's gonna be a fucked up picture of my face.
[267:39.33]Yes, it is.
[268:06.83]Okay, I have figured out what the lock in the cupboard opens.
[268:10.43]What?
[268:10.53]I- What have I done?
[268:20.77]Imagine how much of a lazy motherfucker you have to be to not check these off automatically.
[268:30.36]How about not explore the town and into every single place?
[268:33.22]Alright, let's go.
[268:34.28]Let's go.
[268:34.64]Let's go.
[268:34.98]Let's go.
[268:35.32]Let's go.
[268:35.70]Drew Crew, are you here?
[268:36.58]Drew Crew, are you with me?
[268:43.15]Are you with me?
[268:47.88]Thank you.
[269:36.80]Oh, the music changed.
[269:44.02]Don't like it.
[269:44.42]Don't like it!
[269:47.54]Alright, we got in the lighthouse.
[269:49.10]Um... We got Space Invaders images.
[269:52.85]The star.
[269:55.01]The jellyfish.
[269:57.27]The shark.
[269:59.61]The prongs.
[270:03.06]The anchor.
[270:04.88]The boat.
[270:06.38]The crab.
[270:08.64]The nuclear launch.
[270:14.23]What else we got?
[270:14.75]I need to turn this place back on, right?
[270:23.19]Probably shouldn't have ran by everything.
[270:28.08]Um, well, shit, guys.
[270:32.06]I think I'm stumped.
[270:45.11]Call the intern.
[270:47.78]From what phone?
[270:51.54]Wait.
[270:54.43]Uh oh, this phone.
[270:56.44]Yoshi!
[270:57.24]Idiot.
[270:58.24]Finally a real puzzle.
[271:21.80]Okay.
[271:22.10]What the fuck are you doing?
[271:23.10]Am I playing Tetris?
[271:23.66]Green and green is red.
[271:24.56]And then red and...
[271:50.99]Is this just 20 or 2048?
[271:53.93]And then... And then red and red is the wheel, and the wheel and the wheel is...
[272:26.71]Okay.
[272:27.53]I'm not softlocked.
[272:28.73]I've played that game before.
[272:32.11]Actually, guys, I played the original one.
[272:38.41]Done.
[272:39.46]How many?
[272:39.90]There's more than one?
[272:41.84]I played Threes.
[272:43.14]Yeah.
[272:43.98]Threes is the one that they made, and then 2048 just made another one.
[272:49.34]And 2048 was like 5 million times more popular.
[273:02.79]I think it's fine if I... Let's see.
[273:10.10]What happens if I go left?
[273:11.62]Yeah, I think you actually can softlock yourself, so I gotta be careful.
[273:23.41]Yeah, it's very softlockable.
[273:25.07]It's softlockable.
[273:28.21]Can I combine the two white?
[273:40.12]No, you can't.
[273:46.45]Almost there.
[273:47.61]Just a few more lights.
[273:52.23]Bring this one up.
[273:53.13]Bring this one over.
[273:55.65]Bring this one down.
[273:56.67]Thank you!
[273:57.01]Two more.
[274:30.67]I gotta get this shit over here.
[274:41.56]Two more.
[274:44.76]This is actually gonna get pretty tricky.
[274:46.47]I gotta be careful.
[274:47.09]Uh-oh.
[274:51.03]I'm about to fuck it.
[274:52.87]I'm about to fuck it all up.
[274:56.40]Oh, no, no!
[274:57.84]Oh, I fucked it up!
[274:59.40]Oh, God, I gotta do it all in one go.
[275:01.52]Shit.
[275:01.82]Okay, I know what to do.
[275:02.96]I know what they want me to do.
[275:03.67]I know what to do.
[275:04.03]Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
[275:14.25]Hope we're gonna be here for a while.
[275:22.67]Oh, it's idiot-proof.
[275:25.55]How would you ever say this was idiot-proof?
[275:36.94]Like, what are you talking about?
[275:56.44]This is an iPad game now.
[275:59.66]Koala brain stream, right?
[276:01.46]Yeah, you do it.
[276:02.56]Yeah, you do it.
[276:03.56]You do it.
[276:04.28]You get them all in one go.
[276:05.53]You do it.
[276:07.37]You do it.
[276:08.31]Zebra?
[276:19.23]Wait, a zebra's smart?
[276:21.21]I hope not.
[276:24.03]No way, they're definitely not.
[276:34.76]There's no way a zebra's smart.
[276:46.03]Easy.
[276:46.25]It's left, right, left, right, left, right, left.
[276:49.01]Why would I do that to make a little joke when I'm halfway there?
[276:51.54]Why would I do that?
[277:10.00]I got to get rid of these blue ones or I'm going to be fucking screwed again.
[277:13.14]No, don't do it.
[277:15.44]No.
[277:15.56]Wow.
[277:15.72]Wow.
[277:48.09]Oh, fuck.
[277:48.89]I screwed it up.
[277:50.59]I think I can still salvage it.
[277:54.01]Oh, I'm in deep shit now.
[277:55.65]I'm in deep shit now.
[277:56.53]I fucked the whole thing up.
[277:58.53]No, I didn't.
[277:58.89]Not yet.
[277:59.19]Not yet.
[278:00.99]Not yet.
[278:06.50]Gimme.
[278:07.96]Gimme one.
[278:08.68]Ugh.
[278:13.88]Fuck.
[278:15.95]Fuck.
[278:17.76]It's over.
[278:20.20]Dude, this is fucking insane!
[278:22.69]I'm getting two more after that?
[278:40.58]It's easy.
[278:41.10]Just left, right, left, right, left, right.
[279:06.79]No, you were wrong.
[279:24.90]Ugh.
[279:56.64]Smart clicks?
[279:57.40]Are you out of your mind?
[280:01.56]Have I ever played 2048?
[280:04.74]I just told you I played the original.
[280:09.35]Here's the difference.
[280:10.79]In 2048, you don't have to leave shit on the goddamn game board.
[280:16.13]You can combine things forever.
[280:40.97]I just told you I played the original.
[280:44.37]Why would I lie about playing the original?
[280:48.26]2048's not even the original.
[280:51.40]It's Threes, dammit, Threes!
[281:02.94]He's played every iPad game.
[281:04.28]That's right, I have!
[281:07.98]I have played every iPad game.
[281:12.32]I would know.
[281:12.76]Nooo!
[281:42.80]This sucks.
[281:55.71]You gotta get rid of the blue.
[281:57.15]You gotta keep getting rid of blue.
[282:20.90]Get out of here, come on!
[282:27.86]You're no longer part of the Drew Crew?
[282:31.21]You can't leave the Drew Crew!
[282:37.25]Hey, hey!
[282:38.85]Hey, fellas!
[282:40.43]He thinks he can leave the Drew Crew!
[282:43.87]Oh, boy!
[282:54.27]Once you're in the Dru crew, you're in it for life.
[283:16.20]Fuck!
[283:17.97]Fuck!
[283:18.85]It's okay.
[283:43.84]Fuck!
[283:56.77]Fuck!
[284:06.87]I need to go- Wait, I think I can still- Wait, wait, wait
[284:14.99]How are you supposed to get all of them?
[284:17.17]How are you supposed to get all of them?
[284:21.90]All of them.
[284:22.46]You're gonna get all of these things?
[284:24.42]Like, what?
[284:27.32]Give me a fucking break.
[284:28.76]You're gonna get... You're gonna fill the whole board?
[284:31.47]Solve it already.
[284:32.47]I can't.
[284:34.65]It's alright.
[284:36.97]Everything's gonna be fine.
[285:18.89]Just go up, stick to one corner.
[285:20.73]Don't tell me how to play!
[285:35.98]I'm on the computer.
[286:10.59]I got it.
[286:58.73]Why'd you have to spawn there of all places?
[287:00.40]Why'd you spawn there?
[287:02.20]Why did it spawn there?
[287:03.59]You spawned in such a bad place!
[288:03.68]I hate this.
[288:05.00]Why does it have to be like this?
[288:08.06]The game that they copied to do this is not even like this.
[288:25.86]Dumbass game.
[288:38.31]I don't even... Oh my god, I don't even... I don't even... I don't... I don't wanna play the, like, impossible version of 2048.
[288:44.36]Fucking Nancy Drew.
[289:05.05]Remember when this was a Nancy Drew stream?
[289:06.59]Remember when Nancy Drew made 35 games and 27 of them were terrible?
[289:11.42]You remember that?
[289:12.84]I remember that.
[289:23.39]You take that back.
[289:46.33]And he lost his job as a streamer for doing it because everyone but the Drew Crew left.
[289:51.23]You know how many actual Drew Crew fans there were?
[289:53.55]Zero.
[290:02.05]Streamer can't beat game for little girls.
[290:09.82]That's not even accurate.
[290:12.44]That's not even accurate.
[290:15.44]I expect the drool crew to get behind me on this one.
[290:37.82]Okay, I have to beat this.
[290:40.42]This is gonna drive me crazy.
[290:43.71]Alright, I gotta do a real attempt.
[290:46.20]I gotta do a real attempt.
[290:47.26]A real attempt.
[290:47.84]A real attempt.
[291:29.35]Just stay in one corner?
[291:30.37]That doesn't make any sense.
[291:33.19]Spam a corner?
[291:53.39]Fuck the Dru crew.
[291:55.73]I didn't say that, you did.
[292:00.97]How could you say something like, just so disgusting?
[292:12.74]Alright.
[292:13.46]That one's up there.
[292:29.04]You're playing this all wrong.
[292:34.68]This is just stupid.
[292:40.70]You know how many seven-year-old girls would give the fuck up an hour and a half ago when they had to go find the note in the guy's shoebox?
[293:22.40]I'm gonna smash my computer.
[293:28.64]Ow, my stomach.
[293:34.55]Imagine.
[293:35.71]Can you imagine?
[293:37.29]That's what does it.
[293:38.55]Is the Nancy Drew 3 knockoff.
[293:42.17]The Nancy Drew 2048 copy-paste game without numbers on it that leaves shit on the board.
[293:48.69]That's what's gonna do it.
[294:01.72]Alright, nobody breathe.

[319:09.20]Yeah, there's a lot of you, actually.
[319:11.31]Oh, okay.
[319:15.32]Don't mess this up, I need you here.
[319:33.12]Left.
[319:35.96]Not left, please God.
[319:37.24]Oh my God, just redo it again.
[319:39.12]All the Brissettas need to pick something.
[319:51.48]Don't little girls play this game.
[319:54.57]Sure.
[319:58.61]Uh-oh.
[320:04.45]Up?
[320:11.86]Left, up, left, up, up.
[320:13.84]Left, up, left, up, left, up, up.

[320:21.54]Time to phone Alex again.
[321:00.29]I did it!
[321:02.13]I was here.
[321:03.03]I was here.
[321:05.66]I was here.
[321:06.30]We did it better than you.
[321:08.54]30% of you were me.
[321:09.94]So, you were doing it wrong.
[321:12.26]30% of you were clicking the shiny button on the screen.
[321:13.98]So sure, like 38% of you guys knew what you were doing.
[321:16.54]And the rest of you could just be lumped in with me.
[321:18.21]So...
[321:40.75]Are we getting locked in here?
[321:42.93]Uh-oh.
[321:43.05]Uh-oh.
[321:43.35]Somebody trying to kill me?
[321:49.79]Uh-oh.
[322:10.78]Oh, my fucking god.
[322:25.69]11, 13.
[322:27.81]2, 4. 2.
[322:35.50]17 minus 29.
[322:35.78]No, 11 is... 6, 7, 8, 9.
[322:36.12]6, 7, 8, 8, 9.
[322:37.60]Was there 7?
[322:38.10]7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, which is a 6.
[322:39.32]Okay, 13 is 7, 8, 9, 4, 5, 6.
[322:40.02]That's obviously not correct. 2...
[323:09.95]Two and two is four.
[323:12.99]Three and five is seven.
[323:16.55]Seven and six and three is nine.
[323:19.26]Let's do small at the bottom.
[323:24.78]Yeah, alright.
[323:26.30]What do you... Please.
[323:31.26]What?
[323:31.86]I had it.
[323:32.60]Get out of my head.
[323:34.40]Get out of my head.
[323:35.12]Get out of my head.
[323:36.06]Get out of my head.
[323:36.68]Small numbers at the bottom.
[323:40.07]Six and... I had it right.
[323:42.47]No, I was doing right.
[323:43.43]Get out of my head.
[323:45.29]Get out of... You guys are stuffed in here.
[323:47.63]Five.
[323:48.23]Two.
[323:49.69]Uh... How would I rate this stream from a one out of ten?
[323:57.55]Ten!
[323:57.85]Uh, four plus three.
[324:02.63]But I can't move thirteen.
[324:03.85]This has to act... Somebody said small numbers at the bottom.
[324:06.79]That's not true!
[324:07.67]Because I need to make thirteen!
[324:16.13]I had it correct.
[324:17.78]It's 8... It was... 6 and... And... 8.
[324:23.52]No, 6 and... 8 and... Fuck.
[324:27.82]9 and 4.
[324:28.74]I don't... I don't know.
[324:29.94]9 and 4.
[324:30.26]2, 4, 5, 6.
[324:30.66]6 over here.
[324:31.96]Uh, 4.
[324:33.17]Because I have a 4.
[324:35.77]There's a 4 here, but I can't... Start at the top.
[324:43.41]Why would I start at the top?
[324:44.49]36 and...
[324:47.02]36, 63, 36, and 27 is... It's too cold, and I'm so tired.
[324:51.66]Hey, they're gonna get a plus one in the chat for Nancy Drew!
[325:17.99]The big number at the top the big number
[325:33.17]Alright, 20, 36, 46, 56.
[325:33.61]That's not correct.
[325:34.39]36, 46, 56.
[325:34.47]57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63.
[325:34.89]I need 27.
[325:35.17]27.
[325:35.19]So 13 plus what is 27?
[325:36.95]13, 24, 25, 26, 27, 13.
[325:37.11]Do we have another day 13?
[325:38.63]Something I have lying around here somewhere.
[325:41.63]13 plus 14 is right there.
[325:42.13]Alright, 14 plus what?
[325:42.88]14, 24, 34, 22, 25.
[326:02.25]We got 13 plus 13, 23, 9.
[326:03.05]And then we have 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[326:03.79]That's 5.
[326:03.97]Uh-oh.
[326:04.17]9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 is 5.
[326:06.03]There's no 5.
[326:06.85]14 is 11 and... 11 and 3.
[326:07.41]Okay, so now we got 2 and 1.
[326:32.20]I'm blind at the top.
[326:33.24]What?
[326:34.34]Five and... I'm blind?
[326:36.65]Am I?
[326:37.61]What was it again?
[326:38.65]Four.
[326:39.29]Fourteen.
[326:39.71]Five.
[326:40.71]What?
[326:41.23]What am I doing?
[326:42.09]Uh, it was... Twelve.
[326:43.67]No.
[326:44.23]Eleven?
[326:45.48]What was it?
[326:46.36]Six?
[326:47.10]And... No.
[326:48.12]Seven.
[326:49.02]Seven and seven.
[326:49.64]Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
[326:50.92]No, that's not correct.
[326:51.68]Eight.
[326:53.16]9.
[326:53.38]What is 9?
[326:53.80]9.
[326:54.82]9, 10, 11, 12.
[326:55.92]That's 13.
[326:57.76]Alright.
[326:59.74]13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
[327:00.66]We need 4.
[327:01.91]I got a 4 right here.
[327:03.45]Now we got 5.
[327:04.39]That doesn't equal that.
[327:05.23]That doesn't make any sense.
[327:06.41]That's not correct.
[327:07.17]This is incorrect.
[327:07.87]I need a 2 over here.
[327:08.77]No, this is wrong.
[327:09.33]9, 14, um... 5 and 4 is... Is there a 0?
[327:23.33]Replace 22.
[327:23.65]13 and 5 don't make 22.
[327:25.08]No, that's correct.
[327:25.60]13, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[327:25.88]7 and... 9, 4, 2, 3, 9, 4.
[327:26.34]9, 4, 2, 3, 5, 9.
[327:27.74]4, 2, 3, 5.
[327:27.88]4, 5, 6 is 6.
[327:28.26]5 and then 3, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[327:29.00]Something's wrong here.
[327:55.91]4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5 is not... One person did that.
[328:02.11]One person... Get the logs and fucking type that in.
[328:07.05]Um... I'm gonna... Oh, God!
[328:13.88]Uh... 6, 7, 2, 3, 5...
[328:21.42]It's too cold and I'm so tired.
[328:32.68]Did somebody screenshot it?
[328:33.54]Screenshot that and remind her to just give it to me.
[328:36.78]Screenshot, screenshot, screenshot.
[328:38.06]Just screenshot it.
[328:39.36]I don't want to do that.
[328:40.55]I'm done.
[328:40.97]Screenshot.
[328:41.25]Just give me a clip of that.
[328:42.67]Just give me a clip.
[328:43.27]I don't care.
[328:43.63]Just give me a clip.
[328:44.35]I just need a clip.
[328:54.15]Yeah, good image.
[328:57.13]It's basic math.
[328:58.01]I don't care.
[329:01.59]It was wrong.
[329:02.25]Don't use it.
[329:03.13]It was wrong.
[329:07.21]What?
[329:09.15]You guys got it wrong, too, then.
[329:10.09]Alright, 63, 26.
[329:11.43]Okay, let's go.

[330:43.79]Can I hear another ship fact?
[330:45.62]I don't, I don't want another ship fact.
[330:46.90]Most people think all pirates were men, but that's not true at all.
[330:50.28]In fact, there were dozens of famous lady pirates in the 16th
[330:54.61]Fix the game window?
[330:55.49]Oh gosh.
[330:55.85]That's... you guys.

[331:28.69]Bye.
[331:29.47]What do I do now?
[331:30.01]What was the point?
[331:32.70]I had to turn this on so somebody could... I don't remember.
[331:38.46]I don't know.
[331:39.20]You think I know what's going on right now?
[331:46.15]Back to the ship.
[331:48.97]Alright, right, right.
[331:49.79]And then I gotta call...
[331:55.32]Back to the- back to the radio room.
[331:59.62]You got it!
[332:08.77]How's it going?
[332:11.61]Goodbye.
[332:12.79]Bye!
[332:13.81]Do you remember more- I'm not gonna say that because I don't get it.
[332:16.31]Alright, uh, now what?
[332:21.49]Who wanted me to turn the lighthouse on in the first place?
[332:23.31]Didn't she want to do that?
[332:35.73]Why would you have a chair alarm?
[332:44.99]Is it... Why does it... What are you doing?
[332:54.82]Oh, her bag!
[332:55.28]Her bag!
[332:55.60]I can take her bag.
[332:56.92]This must be the key to Magnus' cabin.
[332:59.62]I'll just be borrowing this.
[333:03.37]Even Elizabeth never opened her gift.
[333:06.21]I'm in one notes.
[333:07.53]I got the key to the cabin.
[333:16.36]It's that door right there, right?
[333:17.40]The one that she was like, don't go in there.
[333:22.32]Elizabeth must have locked it.
[333:24.78]What on Earth is in here?
[333:32.95]That's not the... That's not a cabin.
[333:36.75]That's not a cabin.
[333:43.97]How is that not a cabin?
[333:50.42]The cabin is in... Log cabin?
[334:00.75]Figure out what the lock in the cupboard opens.
[334:03.23]Why does it want me to still do this?
[334:04.33]Can't check that off yet.
[334:05.41]I don't understand.
[334:07.33]What the... Oh.
[334:10.65]Right.
[334:27.84]Wait, what?
[334:44.99]There's only four numbers I know.
[334:46.03]There's probably more.
[334:54.10]Alright.
[334:55.80]Find and return the helm's missing decorations.
[334:58.20]What the hell does that mean?
[335:05.08]I gotta find this cabin.
[335:10.36]Let's address the cheating.
[335:11.60]See what it says.
[335:23.45]Okay.
[335:28.45]Okay.
[335:35.55]I know what to do.
[335:36.09]Are we underwater?
[335:45.64]Can I get the fuck out of here?
[335:58.57]Alright, I have to go to... The guy's cabin is... You guys were right.
[336:02.32]There actually is a way to go a different way from the snowmobile.
[336:06.84]You were right.
[336:11.74]I could go this way.
[336:24.13]But I thought I could... Before the cave, there was a place to go left.
[336:29.13]Where is it?
[336:30.23]Left on the road?
[336:31.17]Oh, there's no sign.
[336:35.69]Hey, Nancy, it's me.
[336:37.27]Are you busy right now?
[336:37.83]Just a little.
[336:38.19]Why?
[336:38.31]Oh, no.
[336:38.43]No reason.
[336:38.77]Just checking in.
[336:39.15]Just wanted to make sure you were alive and stuff.
[336:40.30]You totally are.
[336:40.64]That's great.

[338:05.28]I don't understand.
[338:07.34]I got some edits I want you to do.
[338:10.57]Ooh, buttons.
[338:11.19]What about the bed?
[338:18.01]I need ten of these?

[338:46.13]Star.
[338:49.45]Okay, I can't open this.
[338:50.33]It's making a weird noise.
[338:54.52]These must belong with that reference I saw earlier.
[338:56.92]Jesus Christ.
[338:57.70]Four of each color down and across.
[338:59.90]No three together in a line.
[339:01.72]What?
[339:02.00]Four of... What are you... What is going on?
[339:11.35]Four of each color in a... In range of crystals, according to the note about crystals, four colors of each crystal in a row and column.
[339:33.27]I did just yawn.
[339:46.28]I did.
[339:46.72]Yeah, you caught me.
[339:47.87]You did.
[339:50.23]Damn it.

[339:58.42]So... Four?
[340:00.50]I have to go... Of each color, go... What does the dumb note say?
[340:14.97]Chat, just do it.
[340:16.11]There's no way a human could do it.
[340:21.64]No true Drew crew member would yawn at a Nancy Drew game.
[340:27.99]Why do I hate Nancy Drew?
[340:29.19]I don't.
[340:32.11]Why?
[340:32.43]I don't.
[340:32.75]Let me see if I can figure this out.
[340:40.36]Four have to go across.
[340:41.32]Let's see.
[340:41.76]I don't know if I go to these two down here.
[340:45.50]Wait.
[340:45.72]Hold on.
[340:48.61]You need four of each, so that means they don't have to be in a row.
[340:56.45]I could do, wait, hold on.
[341:00.01]Yeah, they don't have to be in a row.
[341:09.44]One, two, okay.
[341:18.71]Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep.
[341:22.85]One, two, three, four.
[341:27.23]Okay.
[341:29.99]Make them all blue, then work backwards.
[341:32.03]I'm kind of, I'm feeling it.
[341:34.67]I'm feeling it.
[341:36.89]I'm gonna do rows.
[341:38.73]Okay, here we go.
[341:39.32]Let's go.
[341:39.90]Ready?
[341:47.04]That one's done.
[341:57.11]Okay.
[341:57.63]How am I doing on these roads?
[341:58.55]Is it fine?
[342:11.50]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep.
[342:20.25]I'm almost done!
[342:21.59]I see- hold on.
[342:23.19]Let's go.
[342:31.51]Uhh...
[342:43.71]What are they for?
[342:45.40]What are they for?
[342:47.04]What are they for?
[342:49.02]What are they for?
[342:50.76]What are they for?
[342:52.58]What are they for?
[343:38.89]Now you're actually gonna put me to sleep.
[343:40.39]Alright, turn that off.
[343:40.93]What do I need to do?
[343:45.49]Who cares?
[343:46.80]Why does this matter?
[344:11.22]No, get out of this.
[344:21.45]What am I supposed to do with this?
[344:22.45]Is that really key?
[344:24.71]I don't know.
[344:25.63]I need to arrange these pieces to see what the full image looks like.
[344:29.33]What pieces?
[344:30.65]Oh, shit.
[344:32.21]Okay.
[344:33.91]Dude, alright, let's go.
[344:34.73]Drew crew!
[344:40.36]I have one of those.
[344:41.38]Where is it?
[344:42.26]Where's my sketch?
[344:44.00]Oh, no, that is the sketch.
[344:46.32]Alright, we'll go, uh, I don't know, right here?
[344:47.86]I need, uh, top.
[344:59.37]Oh, what the fuck?
[345:00.79]It's pretty easy.
[345:02.89]Why can't I move it?
[345:05.14]Why can't I, like, put shit on the bottom?
[345:23.46]This is a children's six piece- I can't even place anything!
[345:26.56]I can only place it on the bottom!
[345:43.99]Ooh!
[345:45.01]I can't even do it!
[345:45.57]Yeah, I can't do that, guys.
[345:48.73]It's not completable.
[345:49.63]I'm missing pieces, man.
[345:56.87]How many more are these?
[345:57.45]What is this?
[345:59.79]Hi, Mogs.
[346:00.47]It's me.
[346:01.63]Haven't talked to you in a while.
[346:03.83]Like a month.
[346:05.79]I literally can't believe you still have a landline.
[346:08.55]What are you, 90?
[346:11.06]Mogs, please pick up.
[346:13.56]I'm sorry about last night.
[346:14.80]Hi, Magnus.
[346:16.82]It's Gracie from International Publishing House.
[346:19.14]Just wanted to reach out about your latest manuscript.
[346:21.62]Yeah?
[346:21.80]The editor really enjoyed Mermaid.
[346:24.50]Okay, nice.
[346:25.66]Post-modernist.
[346:30.07]Publishing agreement.
[346:31.89]OK.
[346:32.17]We do have some questions about scope.
[346:34.19]We think 240 limericks might be a little much.
[346:37.90]Is there any way you could cut that down a bit?
[346:39.80]Depends.
[346:40.40]Anyway, give me a call back, and I'd love to chat further.
[346:43.18]Will do.
[346:43.78]We'll definitely call you back.
[346:44.66]Thank you.
[346:46.71]Probably shouldn't erase this one.
[346:50.42]I don't know how to erase.
[346:53.48]Only accumulate.
[347:17.11]A crow's nest.
[347:18.75]This is it.
[347:19.87]Solution is to divide into groups of six.
[347:22.73]No group touching another.
[347:24.05]Attempt after the festival crowds die down.
[347:34.77]A dog bed, but no dog?
[347:37.57]There's a dog.
[347:39.63]This thing probably stinks.
[347:42.05]You need to clean that.
[347:44.71]A spare luggage key, huh?
[347:47.96]Luggage key.
[347:51.04]Where's the reason to work with the original... Helterhide?
[347:54.50]For all to enjoy.
[347:57.04]Did you see this?
[347:58.02]There's going to be tourists crawling all over the thing.
[347:59.60]We need to move faster.
[348:00.60]By the way, you're mutt-like shiny things.
[348:03.14]Discovered this the hard way when spare luggage key went missing yesterday.
[348:05.85]Briefly saw it in Toomey's mouth, but he ran off with it.
[348:09.83]Can you keep an eye out for it?
[348:11.01]I figured it's going to go back one way or another.
[348:13.03]I check wherever he spends a lot of time.
[348:14.91]Wear gloves.
[348:15.61]P.S.
[348:20.35]Luggage key.
[348:25.25]Luggage key now.
[348:26.53]What the?
[348:29.71]Luggage key.
[348:30.93]Can't check that off yet.
[348:32.45]But where is that?
[348:35.09]Still have to do.
[348:35.83]Can't check.
[348:36.49]Haven't.
[348:36.85]Can't check.
[348:37.41]Still haven't.
[348:38.27]Can't check that off yet.
[348:40.59]What the hell is this?
[348:41.57]Dog toys?
[348:43.09]This must be related to the note Magnus left for himself.
[348:49.33]Oh, is it this thing?
[348:50.82]Uh, Mr.
[349:30.86]No dog next to dog.
[349:32.20]Okay, looks fine.
[349:36.88]No dog next to dog.
[349:41.18]Alright.
[349:45.08]It's a little tricky, but, you know, you gotta just punch your way at it.
[349:48.29]Mm-hmm.
[350:00.16]It's very tricky.
[350:00.92]It is.
[350:01.22]It's pretty tricky.
[350:10.25]How am I out of dogs?
[350:15.11]What?
[350:24.93]Oh, that's for amateur.
[350:26.19]Okay, I see.
[350:29.28]Excuse me, I meant to say, let me do this 45 minute long puzzle on my own.
[350:35.24]I wonder if anyone else has seen these.
[350:53.69]You can do it.
[350:54.35]I tried.
[350:54.73]It's only 45 minutes if you suck.
[351:01.44]Need to know you're with me, that you're going to see this through, just like we talked about when we started this project.
[351:06.82]Okay.
[351:10.00]I got the document.
[351:12.18]You've always had my word.
[351:13.86]You still do.
[351:14.52]No need for that.
[351:15.22]So, uh, so Dagny is in trouble.
[351:20.48]You're in deep shit.
[351:21.56]I still need, uh, how many coins?
[351:22.62]Two more coins?
[351:25.18]You see any?
[351:34.32]I don't see any more coins.
[351:38.44]Oh.
[351:39.36]I see one.
[351:40.48]One more coin.
[351:40.96]That's it.
[351:41.28]That looks like one up there.
[351:45.04]It's not?
[351:45.52]How is that possible?
[351:49.23]Where's the last coin?
[351:57.05]During my boots.
[352:01.16]Coin?
[352:02.42]Is there a coin anywhere?
[352:04.56]There's one more hanging out somewhere.
[352:06.43]Where?
[352:13.73]Mod Kim?
[352:15.35]Oh, last time Kim was a mod, she banned like 200 people.
[352:29.42]Checking the- boy, there's a bathroom?
[352:32.08]Oh shit, there is a bathroom.
[352:33.46]Can I get in there?
[352:41.44]Ban Kim.
[352:42.26]No, Kim doesn't need to be banned.
[352:48.76]Where's this last coin before I lose my mind?
[352:51.18]No, I'll do this instead.
[353:04.41]No, they're... She already is a VIP.
[353:15.72]You're a fucking moron.
[353:17.20]Whoa.
[353:19.58]Whoa, man.
[353:21.08]Whoa.
[353:25.86]Whoa.
[353:27.46]What?
[353:27.90]Why did you say that?
[353:30.98]Alright, alright, but... Alright, but why did you say that?
[353:35.63]We're supposed to be part of the Dru crew together and you're going to come at me with that kind of shit?
[353:41.00]Come on.
[353:42.98]We're in this together forever.
[353:46.54]Dru crew.
[353:49.06]I thought you guys had my back.
[353:50.93]I'm just going to look up where the coin is.
[353:56.95]Who cares?
[353:57.33]Where's the coin?
[354:08.45]Where's the coin?
[354:13.61]What do you mean cheating?
[354:14.73]It's not cheating if you don't see it.
[354:18.07]I'm getting directions.
[354:20.15]It's that up there, but it's not.
[354:23.47]Give me a hint then.
[354:28.45]You can't go in the bathroom.
[354:31.37]Do you guys know where it is?
[354:32.16]I don't think you do.
[354:35.80]The box.
[354:42.07]There's nothing in the box.
[354:46.48]Left pocket.
[354:48.18]Yeah.
[354:48.78]Uh, Nancy Drew would not approve of cheating.
[355:10.38]It's not cheating if I don't get caught.
[355:12.64]What?
[355:13.76]What's on the lid of the box?
[355:21.71]Go stand by the front door and check the ceiling light.
[355:53.24]I thought I made... What noise?
[355:55.15]You thought I made what noise?
[355:59.29]Do the chest puzzle.
[356:01.73]There is no puzzle.
[356:04.61]I can't do anything.
[356:15.42]This is easy.
[356:16.96]There's nothing to do!
[356:22.01]I'm just leaving.
[356:23.16]I'm going somewhere else to do another part of the game.
[356:30.44]Check the door frame.
[356:34.22]Already got that one.
[356:42.39]Quick, please, Kim.
[356:43.59]The Drew crew needs our cheese toasties.
[356:47.07]Those are so good.
[356:48.22]Haven't done that.
[356:50.09]Keyhole at the bottom of the box.
[356:51.39]I don't have a key.
[356:55.07]It's a luggage key.
[357:00.54]That doesn't work.
[357:09.92]Kim, please, I need my toasties.
[357:11.66]Alright, in the pre-stream chat earlier,
[357:16.93]She asked if I wanted any cheese toasties and tomato soup.
[357:21.20]She was just, she was being funny and people think that I need my cheese toasties.
[357:31.54]The shelf?
[357:36.83]There's nothing on the shelf.
[357:39.09]I did this already.
[357:48.35]I'm just leaving.
[357:49.15]I don't give a fuck.
[357:57.23]Behind the TV?
[357:59.27]Why would you even hide this shit?
[358:03.45]That's not even a puzzle.
[358:07.40]That's not a puzzle, it's padding.
[358:10.70]We need to, as the Druid crew, we need to know the difference.
[358:12.92]I'm sorry.
[358:26.95]I'm done.
[358:28.29]Get me the fuck out of this house.
[358:45.43]Alright.
[358:50.85]He's quitting, Nancy Drew.
[358:54.80]I don't understand.
[358:58.08]Why didn't she say that before?
[359:00.90]I've had this hook in my inventory.
[359:03.70]Okay, that's... Why can't I quit you?
[359:11.41]I don't know.
[359:11.79]I don't know, but this kind of looks like my colonoscopy images.
[359:18.93]Without the ice.
[359:28.75]Down here?
[359:35.73]Hello?
[359:36.05]Remember when we did that colonoscopy and there was a little ladder in your colon?
[359:46.29]Somebody's in there.
[359:47.21]Somebody's living in there.
[359:48.22]Ooh, I need those.
[360:01.67]Anything else down here?
[360:02.51]There's oil right here.
[360:07.60]Can I do anything with the oil?
[360:12.24]Uh... I'm lost in my colon.
[360:32.93]I... Okay.
[360:35.19]Apparently I can die down here.
[360:39.74]Alright, well, I have... Is there anything else I need down here?
[360:47.44]I can't break this one?
[360:49.60]Where am I?
[360:58.89]What?
[361:01.95]Where the...
[361:05.97]What the fuck is going on?
[361:09.33]This is a maze.
[361:24.31]Okay, Nancy.
[361:27.25]Where do you suggest I go?
[361:28.13]Do I have any service down here?
[361:31.20]Alright.
[361:31.94]Did I take a selfie down here?
[361:35.18]To prove that I was down here?
[362:01.15]Alright, how do I get out of here?
[362:03.61]Go up the ladder.
[362:04.55]And then... I can go this way.
[362:07.95]Am I going the right way?
[362:14.76]What the fuck is going on?
[362:23.84]Uh... Ooh.
[362:26.40]There's a... A generator.
[362:45.33]How did I do that?
[363:01.88]Okay, there's a ladder.
[363:02.78]There was the glove?
[363:16.99]That glove doesn't do anything.
[363:19.33]I looked at it already.
[363:20.11]Okay, up the ladder.
[363:28.00]There's two ways to go.
[363:29.52]Where did I go last time?
[363:33.22]Did I go...
[363:47.16]I... Okay.
[363:50.58]I was already down here.
[363:51.38]Is there anything else in here?
[363:53.04]I don't think there's anything in here.
[364:04.37]I'm just leaving.
[364:06.72]Alright, pull me out.
[364:07.54]Get me out of this.
[364:08.14]Get me out of the colon.
[364:17.73]Okay, I got those sketch pieces.
[364:25.95]Blue alien colon.
[364:27.19]Where was the sketch thing?
[364:31.13]Right here, right?
[364:32.97]Where do I put them?
[364:36.90]Wait, wait.
[364:38.58]No memory?
[364:39.34]No.
[364:40.44]There's... It's back in the other house?
[364:46.64]I put 25 things in my inventory.
[364:51.90]Right, okay, it's this thing.
[364:56.17]Can I do this yet?
[365:03.23]Well, that goes here?
[365:17.63]Do I need more sketch pieces?
[365:19.61]Or what?
[365:34.92]That's not where that goes.
[365:36.04]I can't even place anything.
[365:39.28]I can't even pick this up.
[365:51.10]Didn't it say overlapping?
[365:54.85]So why can I not put it down?
[365:55.81]I get it.
[366:07.13]I know.
[366:07.43]I know.
[366:08.21]You didn't know I had to do that either.
[366:10.54]I know for a fact that half you guys are going, oh, shit.
[366:14.52]That's what I have to do.
[366:15.44]Fuck.
[366:15.78]Okay.
[366:24.05]I need more, I can't do it yet.
[366:25.11]Yeah, this is not, I can't do this.

[367:44.66]Just relax.

[367:55.14]I know.
[367:55.86]That's fine.
[367:56.92]That's fair.
[367:57.38]I'll take it.
[368:02.96]Where was that luggage?
[368:04.00]There was a weird piece of luggage hanging out somewhere.
[368:06.40]Where was it?
[368:06.86]There's a coin in that closet.
[368:19.94]Are you fucking kidding me?
[368:21.62]You gotta be kidding me.
[368:22.44]What's this doing in here?
[368:27.78]They put nine coins in one room.
[368:30.98]And then that is the one that's in another room somewhere in the world somewhere?
[368:40.09]Nancy.

[374:34.48]Like dunes.
[374:35.22]Alright, so it's not sand.
[374:36.26]Alright.
[374:37.78]Uh, so we got... We have... Uh... Riverbed...

[375:13.72]What the hell is a gun whale?
[375:16.92]What is four castle?
[375:19.20]What is that?
[375:19.78]What is four castle?
[375:21.14]Castle four?

[375:32.63]So what the hell is that?
[375:35.39]Locator?
[375:37.51]What do I do with this?
[375:47.50]What does a gun wear?
[375:52.42]I don't know.
[376:03.61]So I have the locator now.
[376:04.69]Figure out the importance of the contents of the footlocker.
[376:06.59]Figure out what the lock in the cupboard opens.
[376:11.15]Right, I still don't understand that one.
[376:12.91]Figure out the sounding depth numbers.
[376:18.76]I have no idea.
[376:19.60]Where's this luggage?
[376:20.76]There's luggage in somebody's room.
[376:26.32]Right?
[376:26.60]Remember?
[376:27.66]Who had the luggage?
[376:39.47]Who ordered the luggage?
[376:41.89]Click the map to the left.
[376:46.84]The map?
[377:02.47]Branded luggage?
[377:04.63]Yeah, what does this mean?
[377:21.68]Can I climb this?
[377:29.70]Um... I gotta start talking to people.
[377:36.86]I've got to figure, like, we've got new dialogue to have with people.
[377:39.83]And why do I have this weird egg still?
[377:43.07]Hey, you.
[377:43.71]You got anything new to tell me?
[377:45.15]Oh, hello there.
[377:46.11]Hey, Sorin, just saw someone take a sweater from the gift shop.
[377:52.27]Those are free, right?
[377:53.05]Hey, Sorin, I just saw someone take a sweater from the gift shop.
[377:56.21]Those are free, right?
[377:58.36]No!
[377:59.12]Alright, what am I eating tonight?
[377:59.98]Stop!
[378:00.08]Thief!
[378:05.24]Oh, it's your luggage.
[378:06.18]I'll be taking that.
[378:17.07]Can I get over there?
[378:26.86]Take as long as you want.
[378:28.54]There's no way he'll be back soon.
[378:29.76]Hey!
[378:29.86]Uh... There he was!
[378:36.33]Create Volcanic Winter.
[378:37.76]Alright buddy, slow down.
[378:43.04]Relax.
[378:47.50]Anything else over here?
[378:48.30]Earth.
[378:56.20]And water equals glacier.
[378:58.54]I've played this.
[378:59.04]This is Doodle God.
[379:00.56]Fire and air makes energy.
[379:03.00]Energy and steam makes a geyser.
[379:05.26]A glacier.
[379:06.06]A geyser.
[379:10.54]And steam.
[379:12.50]Okay.
[379:16.66]So now we need water.
[379:18.60]We need glacier and...
[379:22.80]Get this shit out of here.
[379:25.06]Glacier and... Energy.
[379:29.82]It's an erosion.
[379:32.58]A maelstrom.
[379:34.13]Alright, no.
[379:36.71]So I need to do... Let's do fire, water, Earth, glacier, and energy.
[379:45.55]How about air and glacier?
[379:47.66]Glacier.
[379:52.46]Glacier and energy is erosion.
[379:55.10]Steam and glacier is flood.
[379:58.00]Flood and geyser is a maelstrom.
[380:00.02]Flood and erosion is a maelstrom.
[380:02.40]Flood and fire is... Okay, cool.
[380:10.67]I'm going to get these off.
[380:16.39]Let's do...
[380:18.59]Water and Earth is glacier.
[380:21.10]Water and air is cyclone.
[380:24.40]Water and fire is steam.
[380:27.08]Water and Earth is glacier.
[380:30.59]Earth and air is desert.
[380:33.81]Earth and fire is lava, and we've got them all in that category.
[380:38.27]Lava and energy is eruption.
[380:43.27]Lava and steam is a geyser.
[380:46.57]Lava and desert is a rock.
[380:48.91]Lava and cyclone is rock.
[380:51.77]Energy and lava.
[380:53.57]Energy and cyclone is flood.
[380:56.04]Desert and energy is dust cloud.
[380:58.58]Dust cloud and flood is a maelstrom.
[381:02.18]Eruption and dust cloud is volcanic winter.
[381:05.44]I will take it.
[381:06.70]Winter guest records.
[381:23.14]Why, Elizabeth?
[381:28.24]Haven't done that.
[381:29.70]Alright.
[381:30.14]Somebody should probably read that.
[381:33.96]Hmm.
[381:34.14]Here's the luggage.
[381:37.08]Get that shit open.
[381:37.90]What do you got in here?
[381:38.56]Drew, Drew.
[381:39.46]Take a quick look.
[381:40.36]Oh, yeah.
[381:42.20]Oh, yeah.
[381:43.24]Heroes of Land and Sea.
[381:45.95]I'll probably need that at some point.
[381:47.03]Somebody will read that shit.
[381:48.97]Alright.
[381:51.23]I'm ready.
[382:00.70]He's been gone for a really long time.
[382:02.08]Blood.
[382:02.42]Pff.
[382:50.19]Let me note about this.
[382:57.55]The password is not drewcrew, okay?
[383:01.61]I would know, I'm in it.
[383:14.78]Does that work?
[383:21.06]I don't know what the phone is.
[383:22.00]I got bigger fish to fry here.
[383:32.63]Yes, guys.
[383:33.15]Don't worry.
[383:33.79]I passed the fourth grade.
[383:35.15]I know it's not Resitown Sleepboard.
[383:47.19]It's good to hear your voice.
[383:48.93]I have to apologize for earlier.
[383:50.65]It's good to hear your voice, too.
[383:52.78]Sorry I panicked.
[383:54.32]You panicked?
[383:55.42]Over what?
[383:56.56]Look, Nancy, the thing I got you for our anniversary... Ned, yeah, you gotta fuck off.
[384:00.72]It's not a thing.
[384:02.30]It's kind of a... sort of an intangible concept, really.
[384:06.11]When a guy like me begins ruminating, let me tell you, it can get pretty crazy up in the old noggin.
[384:12.29]That's so nonchalant.
[384:33.67]Oh, maybe that one time that you almost burned to death, you know.
[384:36.55]You get it.
[384:39.17]Oh shit, those are spoilers for other games that we're gonna play in the Drew Crew future streams.
[384:45.10]There's this fire within you.
[384:46.96]I firmly believe that you're going to save the world someday.
[384:50.32]At times, I worry like crazy.
[384:52.54]Even if I'm out with my friends or at a game or in the middle of a class.
[384:56.30]I've got one hand on my phone, terrified I might get that call one day.
[385:00.24]A call that this time, you didn't get lucky.
[385:02.72]Remember that time that you froze to death over fourth grade math twice?
[385:07.34]Yeah, funny.
[385:09.33]Yeah, that is kind of funny.
[385:11.47]That is funny.
[385:12.15]That person said that.
[385:12.89]It's funny.
[385:13.57]It is.
[385:15.39]And even though I might get that call someday, I'm not going to let fear hold me back.
[385:19.85]I love you, Nancy.
[385:21.85]I love you so much.
[385:23.31]Wow.
[385:26.27]No, I need to go to the cabin.
[385:43.64]Fucking yikes.
[385:44.48]What?
[385:48.19]Does Ned ever make an appearance in any of the games or is he just a guy on the telephone?
[386:03.58]Why are there two pieces of this?
[386:06.06]Why are there two pieces of this?
[386:10.66]What is this two pieces of this for?
[386:12.22]Oh, okay.
[386:31.43]I was gonna say, why is there two pieces of this?
[386:33.37]Alright.
[386:38.54]Okay.
[386:42.80]This goes over here somewhere, right there.
[386:45.34]Flower goes... Mm-hmm.
[386:49.47]Mm-hmm.
[386:50.01]Mm-hmm.
[386:51.81]Mm-hmm.
[386:53.73]Mm-hmm.
[386:54.23]Mm-hmm.
[386:54.73]Mm-hmm.
[387:06.28]It's over here somewhere.
[387:10.44]It's over here.
[387:20.51]Still missing pieces.
[387:22.77]Stupid.
[387:23.73]Alright, we gotta find Dagny.
[387:29.23]I still don't get what this thing is for.
[387:30.99]What is this for?
[387:34.00]What do we do with the music box?
[387:39.34]I can't move metal pieces.
[387:41.28]They can't be touched.
[387:44.72]It's a puzzle, dumbass.
[387:46.06]Some of you guys could do with some nice training.
[387:51.84]Some of you guys could do with a little bit of nice training.
[388:12.09]You know what I mean?
[388:18.99]I know it's a puzzle, but I've... Don't you mean decency training?
[388:29.12]Stupid fucking dumb fucking idiot.
[388:31.53]Idiot dumb fucking idiot.
[388:41.96]Okay.
[388:44.02]Let's go.
[388:46.92]What else is here?
[388:47.64]Do you have anything?
[388:56.61]How do you know Elizabeth?
[388:57.55]There's a new voice actor again?
[389:13.13]Not so good with a woman like that.
[389:15.72]She's scary.
[389:17.42]I'm hungry.
[389:17.90]Oh, yeah, right.
[389:18.92]She wants revenge on Magnus.
[389:20.91]Angrier than a bull seal on a full moon.
[389:23.69]Still, she lets me sleep and eat here, so that's worth something.
[389:27.63]Did you know about her and Magnus?
[389:29.29]Eggs?
[389:29.59]No.
[389:31.01]We all did.
[389:31.75]My fist good.
[389:32.49]Pizza?
[389:33.19]Nah.
[389:33.49]Cheese toasties?
[389:34.47]Nah.
[389:35.23]Not really.
[389:36.25]Noodles?
[389:37.65]Not a bad idea.
[389:39.23]Doritos?
[389:40.54]No skills to speak of.
[389:41.90]He is, um, how do you say it?
[389:43.80]A runner.
[389:44.14]He runs.
[389:44.82]Ouch.
[389:45.32]I'm glad he's not here to do that.
[389:47.40]Let's vote on whether we should disband the Droog crew.
[389:49.84]I was bitten by a shark once.
[389:51.10]Now I can only speak the truth.
[389:52.95]This is the second time we've ever met.
[389:54.11]Oh, I didn't know that was a side effect of shark bites.
[389:56.60]That's not- I'm not- What?
[389:58.50]That sounded pretty good.
[390:15.35]Looking for this.
[390:18.04]Go!
[390:18.32]Fine, fuck you.
[390:21.00]I have the treasure finder, idiot.
[390:44.78]You are the dumb one.
[390:45.76]What am I supposed to do now?
[391:13.74]Impeach?
[391:14.72]Whatever.
[391:18.16]What about you?
[391:18.60]Let's talk to you.
[391:20.24]Hey, Nancy.
[391:23.48]So you and Sorin work together?
[391:24.68]So you and Sorin work together?
[391:26.99]Yes.
[391:27.71]We both run the festival.
[391:28.85]Remove channel points.
[391:30.51]I can't.
[391:30.91]I've already given it to them.
[391:32.43]They dislike him.
[391:33.73]I'm definitely sensing some of that.
[391:36.31]Why?
[391:37.19]Not one of us.
[391:38.53]He doesn't know our stories.
[391:40.03]No shared memories.
[391:42.00]He mentioned that you've been kind to him.
[391:45.62]Being his friend has a price here.
[391:46.86]Yeah, I'm gonna up the prices, don't worry.
[391:48.02]You are either outside or inside in Skip Road.
[391:51.42]You cannot stand in the doorway.
[391:53.03]You will be driven out.
[391:54.57]We are not like Reykjavik, like a big city.
[391:56.99]Sounds like people are trying to get rid of him.
[391:59.35]Ruining the festival would be a great way to do that, wouldn't it?
[392:02.89]Your words, not mine.
[392:05.68]Regardless, he is welcome in my home, and at my pub.
[392:08.70]I've spent 5,000 points on a reverse tube, and I regret it.
[392:11.64]But I can offer a warm meal and a listening ear.
[392:15.79]Heard about the debt.
[392:16.39]I heard about the town's... debt issues.
[392:19.67]I don't know what you're talking about.
[392:20.95]I found some information in the culture center.
[392:25.47]So, you...
[392:26.84]You want to gloat.
[392:28.30]To chastise me.
[392:29.12]You're not going to use channel points to highlight an Imgur link of my mouth.
[392:33.40]Is that what you did?
[392:35.50]Of course.
[392:35.92]Yeah, it's Joker.
[392:37.82]Yes.
[392:38.82]That's my fault.
[392:40.42]I won't sit here and defend myself.
[392:42.04]Why does every channel have points now?
[392:43.54]Twitch just put it through.
[392:44.46]But I told Soren I was going to fix it.
[392:46.52]It is a new Twitch feature that they have unlocked for, I think, a lot of people now.
[392:50.83]It just, by default, turns on and we gotta figure out what the hell to do with it.
[392:56.61]I'm really sorry to hear about your and Magnus' breakup.
[393:01.06]It hardly matters anymore.
[393:03.00]I don't want to pry, but if you want to talk about it, I'm here.
[393:07.30]Here's one for your case file.
[393:09.50]I've known Magnus all my life.
[393:11.72]We dated four years.
[393:13.52]The winters are long and dark.
[393:16.00]We found each other in that darkness, but then...
[393:20.00]He went through hard times.
[393:21.96]He became obsessed over the ship.
[393:24.09]His world narrowed.
[393:25.63]And soon, there was no room left for me.
[393:28.49]That's the end of it.
[393:29.63]Goodbye.
[393:30.77]Bye now.
[393:31.21]Goodbye.
[393:34.91]Alright, get me... Where am I going?
[393:39.04]I don't know.
[393:39.40]What am I doing?
[393:40.50]I don't know.
[393:42.06]I don't know.
[393:43.08]Figure out the numbers.
[393:43.96]Let me go back up.
[394:01.48]Am I gonna buy AMD calls?
[394:06.46]No, I don't fuck with the stock market anymore.
[394:14.61]Nothing's beyond me.
[394:20.67]Not since I was like, there's no fucking way it's gonna be that expensive.
[394:26.91]No way it's so overvalued.
[394:29.23]It's not worth shit.
[394:32.15]And I was wrong.
[394:47.72]I want to get up to the crow's nest.
[394:51.10]Where's the crow's nest?
[394:53.02]How do I get up to the crow's nest?
[394:54.20]Anybody know?
[394:54.76]How do I get up there?
[394:56.66]I want to get up on the crow's nest.
[395:02.15]Go back to the captain's cabin.
[395:21.47]Seriously.
[395:25.17]Just go down here.
[395:26.69]That's not where I'm trying to go, man.
[395:29.50]Do it.
[395:46.22]Fucking Christ.
[395:47.28]Okay.
[395:48.70]What am I doing in here?
[395:57.99]What is this thing?
[396:03.71]Do I still have fucked up lips?
[396:05.69]I don't know.
[396:06.05]Let's find out.
[396:08.15]Probably.
[396:08.55]It looks okay.
[396:14.07]I've absorbed most of it.
[396:19.88]Not as bad.
[396:20.38]No, not as bad.
[396:36.45]What on Earth do I do with this shit?
[396:41.55]Why do I have lopsided ears?
[396:43.55]I don't know, because I'm a human.
[396:45.22]And my genetic DNA has made me look different than everybody else.
[396:49.46]And, yeah, some of us have, like, a longer finger.
[396:52.42]A bigger earlobe.
[396:54.46]A slightly elongated nose.
[396:56.82]A big toe that is as big as three big toes put together.
[396:59.58]Some of us... I'm a human being.
[397:01.50]I'm just a person here.
[397:06.91]Have I been streaming for almost seven hours?
[397:24.02]Seven hours into Antidrew?
[397:24.96]Oh, I wouldn't have it any other way.
[397:27.82]I hate this game, so I would not have it any other way.
[397:36.98]That's the doggy kennel in Magnus' note.
[397:40.08]What are you talking about?
[397:43.98]What?
[397:44.96]Why does it hurt doggy key?
[397:46.56]What's the doggy key for?
[397:53.28]What do I have a doggy key for?
[397:57.23]Fake member of the Drew Crew?
[397:59.43]I bet you half the Drew Crew does not like this game.
[398:02.63]That doesn't mean we have to make fun of it.
[398:10.56]Is that for the music box?
[398:11.54]The dog key is for the music box.
[398:14.21]You shouldn't be.
[398:24.89]You're projecting.
[398:31.02]I'm not projecting.
[398:35.26]This is projecting!
[398:37.92]Doesn't know where the key goes.
[399:20.61]Use fidget spinner in the radio room.
[399:26.51]What?
[399:28.79]Use a fidget spinner in the radio room?
[399:40.52]That makes sense.
[399:53.14]These must be the sounding charts from Magnus's notebook.
[399:55.64]Oh, shit.
[399:55.98]I need to find those numbers and the locator compass he mentioned.
[399:59.54]Oh, shit.
[400:00.18]Let's go.
[400:13.03]These must be the sounding charts from Magnus's notebook.
[400:15.87]I need to find those numbers and the locator compass he mentioned.
[400:19.57]The numbers first.
[400:21.72]I don't know how the fuck to get the numbers.

[400:53.72]I just, I cheated.
[400:59.16]We're cheaters.
[401:04.93]What's the tide at?
[401:06.33]Tide's high?

[408:01.41]Some of the new characters that have made appearances.
[408:03.39]I'm not sure how many there have been so far, but we'll do it.
[408:08.81]No, not Bugleberry, because Bugleberry was introduced last year, so you cannot nominate Bugleberry again.
[408:16.28]He's not a new character.
[408:21.12]Bugleberry was in the stream last year.
[408:26.45]Worst face video and screenshot.
[408:30.49]I want a clip of the face you're describing and a screenshot of the worst image from that face.

[409:04.14]No, no, no, no.
[409:04.58]This is like the worst experience you had in the chat.

[409:56.20]I don't even need to explain that.
[409:58.12]Here's a new one for 2019.
[410:01.18]Best one guy moment.
[410:05.62]A moment where one person potentially changed the course of an entire stream.
[410:11.57]Best moment.
[410:12.71]Best one guy moment.
[410:13.79]If you got a lot of them, then I'm sure there'll be plenty of nominees.
[410:23.59]Worst gamer moment.
[410:26.14]Something that was just unbelievable.
[410:28.48]I did it.
[410:28.94]It was so bad that you can't even describe to anybody just how shitty that was.
[410:35.60]Whether I fell off a cliff or I did something.
[410:38.00]Worst is terrible gaming, video gaming.
[410:42.77]Jump King?
[410:43.45]I beat Jump King.

[410:53.75]Alright, whatever.
[410:54.87]You're free to nominate whatever you want, but it goes through the academy after the nomination process.

[411:04.80]Something that I did, something you never thought I was ever going to do.
[411:08.05]Something that was... You kind of cock your head to the side and go, how did he just do that?
[411:18.33]So worst gamer moment and best gamer moment.
[411:20.97]Also making a new appearance.

[411:24.78]Worst joke taking more than five minutes to set up.
[411:27.88]And best joke taking more than five minutes to set up.
[411:32.10]I think I don't have to explain what that means.
[411:38.40]Guys, every single one of these is, you can't just say today.
[411:42.24]There's been like 250 streams or something this year.
[411:48.03]It's just fresh in your memory.
[411:50.63]Also, worst stream of the year and best stream of the year.
[411:56.97]Good luck with that one.
[411:57.99]What do you think, what's the worst stream of the whole year?
[412:02.34]Oh, this one.
[412:03.10]Get out of here.
[412:05.84]Making a new appearance this year, because it's very important.
[412:09.89]I'm... This one, I don't know how this is going to play out.
[412:14.79]Because it's been a lot.
[412:16.63]I don't know what the nominees for worst joke of the decade will be.
[412:21.62]That also includes YouTube.
[412:26.50]Because we are at 2020.
[412:28.36]And I have been doing this for almost 10 years.
[412:36.35]I've been on YouTube and on Twitch for just barely under 10 full years.
[412:42.99]Worst joke of the whole decade.
[412:47.90]Best joke of the whole decade.
[412:50.14]What do you think is the best thing I've ever done?
[412:51.78]Like, joke-wise.
[412:59.00]Best joke of the decade.
[413:00.54]Good luck with your nominations.
[413:01.66]And then one final thing.
[413:06.14]This is just for fun.
[413:09.98]I could do it on my own.
[413:11.40]I was going to think of maybe surprising people about this, but even I and a few other people that I would bring on to try to do this wouldn't know all these.
[413:19.11]We're going to do a compilation for all the times I've lied on this stream.
[413:24.83]Or on YouTube.
[413:30.57]So if you have...
[413:35.19]If you have something that you would like to nominate for a time that I have lied, and you can give proof, you can show it, I'm gonna make a large compilation video of every single time I've lied.
[413:51.76]Ever or just this year.
[413:53.24]Ever.
[413:58.74]All lies of the decade.
[414:08.89]That would give us 20, well 19 categories.
[414:16.23]Does anybody have a category they would like for a viewer's choice?
[414:31.58]19 categories.
[414:32.86]I'd like to make it a clean 20.
[414:36.42]Best category, worst category.
[414:37.94]I removed the meme-y shitty ones like best ice cream, worst category, best category.
[414:42.48]They were just filler dog shit.
[414:43.82]They're not in it this year.
[414:49.90]Best and worst face.
[414:51.01]Worst face is on there.
[414:52.89]I'm not sure you can have a best face and worst face.
[414:55.53]What would a best face be?
[414:58.13]What would a best face be?
[415:01.15]Loudest vroom.
[415:02.97]I mean, that's not even... That's not even nominations.
[415:08.33]That's just what was the loudest cargo.
[415:10.27]Okay.
[415:11.22]Alright.
[415:11.62]We have to have... We have to find it.
[415:13.84]We gotta find the loudest vrooms of the year.
[415:20.62]Let me add this.
[415:21.44]Let me add this.
[415:22.08]That's so stupid.
[415:24.37]Loudest fucking vrooms.
[415:27.85]Oh, shit.
[415:28.25]Hold on.
[415:32.07]Why is this... I didn't want to do that.
[415:35.17]Jump King is not gonna win.
[415:38.96]I would be shocked.
[415:41.00]Best ignore stream moment?
[415:42.84]How is anyone gonna find that?
[415:44.10]That's a good question.
[415:45.76]That's a really good question.
[415:49.25]Hey, any Nancy Drew?
[415:53.07]Where's my writing music?
[415:58.86]Writing music.
[416:00.96]Where is it?
[416:01.38]I like that stuff.
[416:02.18]It was good.
[416:02.78]Here it is.
[416:08.28]Okay.
[416:08.96]So, anything else besides loudest rooms of the year?
[416:19.83]Loudest of rumors.
[416:25.42]Anything else?
[416:28.93]Best beatbox moment.
[416:30.70]I don't know if that works.
[416:34.26]Loudest rumors of the year.
[416:38.84]Best chat image.
[416:43.52]Best... Best comment Jerma has read.
[416:48.52]That's kind of a one guy.
[416:49.72]That could be filled in the one guy moment.
[416:55.74]Best clip.
[416:58.04]Best clip of the year?
[416:58.80]I feel like it's tough to do best clip of the year because the best clips of the year might actually be in a bunch of these categories.
[417:17.57]Isn't that just one of the most... Yeah, that would be like the most viewed ones, wouldn't it?
[417:20.39]Yeah.
[417:24.61]Worst excuse of the year?
[417:27.19]Best QRS.
[417:30.19]Well, it would just be the original one.
[417:31.47]That happened.
[417:32.71]That happened this year, right?
[417:33.71]I feel like that's gonna get nominated for something.
[417:42.93]Best singing moment.
[417:49.21]That was this, yeah, that was like in January, February, I think.
[417:54.49]How about best singing?
[417:59.25]I feel like there can only be five or six nominations for best singing only because I've probably only done singing like that four or five times this whole year.
[418:16.15]Do I do that a lot?
[418:17.25]I sing a lot.
[418:22.41]Could there be a worst singing and best singing of the year?
[418:25.50]I don't think that it could happen.
[418:32.36]It's gonna be hard to find.
[418:33.74]Alright, I'm gonna put it on here, but remember, keep in mind, some of these categories might get removed if they have two nominations.
[418:48.34]I'm not gonna do a full thing for that.
[418:50.76]Alright, let's do that.
[418:56.23]Best and Worst Singing of the Year.
[419:03.75]Let's put it right here.
[419:07.45]Worst singing and best singing.
[419:15.52]I already know what's going to be nominated here like a thousand times.
[419:21.76]Also, I don't want to go too far and have 30 categories.
[419:33.39]Why not something about the community?
[419:34.37]Like, best community-created content.
[419:37.81]Oh, I don't really want to do that.
[419:40.25]Because I don't want to make community content a contest that will show up at the end of the year.
[419:48.28]Kim and Otto.
[419:49.66]Best Kim or best Otto moment?
[419:53.90]I can name you four or five times where he just kind of... Kim opened the...
[419:59.75]Alright, that's a joke.
[420:01.71]That's a joke category because it's going to be the same clip five times in a row.
[420:07.46]It's going to be Kim opening the door behind me and Otto in her arms.
[420:12.86]Four or five times in a row.
[420:16.70]It's not even... That's the Otto moment.
[420:24.67]Alright, best auto moment.
[420:26.58]I'll allow it.
[420:27.20]That's just, that's stupid enough for me to think it's funny.
[420:29.76]Alright, best auto moment.
[420:31.14]Okay.
[420:44.18]I think that's good.
[420:45.98]Worst hair, new character, face, beater.
[420:49.83]Chat experience.
[420:51.57]Best auto moment.
[420:53.92]best and worst singing, best and worst noise, best and worst impression, worst meltdown, best one-guy moment, best and worst gaming moment, best and worst joke taking more than five minutes to set up, best and worst stream of the year, best and worst joke of the decade, times I've lied, and loudest rumors of the year.
[421:12.40]Theater is a year-old meme.
[421:16.78]I know.
[421:19.66]Good.
[421:21.10]I want it there.
[421:22.12]I want it there because I know I've said it a few times this whole year.
[421:25.39]Who the fuck's even going to find it, though?
[421:31.01]It's time to retire, Peter.
[421:33.03]No, it's not.
[421:34.55]No, it's not.
[421:35.41]Okay, I'll retire it after this.
[421:39.46]But the people that aren't here right now that are going to watch that stream, I want them to see that category and roll their eyes all the way to the back of their head.
[421:49.66]That's the only reason why it's on here.
[421:57.88]Worst cat puke.
[422:01.48]If you think that that's a bad noise or a best noise, go ahead and nominate it.
[422:04.16]We'll see.
[422:13.25]Best scared moment.
[422:16.65]It's gonna get bloated.
[422:17.65]It's gonna get bloated.
[422:23.31]It's gonna start... I gotta put the can on it.
[422:30.78]Biggest... Alright, how about instead of... Just biggest scare.
[422:33.88]Or best scare.
[422:34.96]Best scared moment.
[422:36.26]Okay.
[422:39.12]That works.
[422:39.44]That's good.
[422:44.38]Alright, and that's it.
[422:45.30]I'm capping it here.
[422:46.32]I'm capping it here.
[422:47.18]Best scared.
[422:48.12]Best scare moment.
[422:49.10]There you go.
[422:58.81]So, let's see.
[422:59.33]We got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.
[423:08.62]That's 23 categories.
[423:09.96]I don't like that.
[423:10.44]That's like a scary, like, fucking horror movie number.
[423:13.32]So, we need one more.
[423:17.17]Oh, I'm deleting one.
[423:28.72]Best debate moment.
[423:30.78]No, not best- not quietest room.
[423:41.96]That's not even gonna make any sense.
[423:50.33]Best- best Star Wars shirt.
[423:56.19]That's funny.
[424:01.27]best Star Wars shirt best outfit I don't I wear the same like four pieces of clothing guys best hair no there is no best hair there's only worst hair biggest chin
[424:34.59]Best new character?
[424:37.97]Has it been enough new characters this whole year that have been... I don't think it has been.
[424:47.01]Alright, I'm gonna put it on here.
[424:53.79]I'll put on worst and best new character.
[425:00.94]I mean, it might... I don't know if we have enough, but we'll see.
[425:06.02]That's 24 categories and 26 different videos.
[425:10.73]That's it.
[425:12.97]Check the pinned message in the New Year's... New Year's... New Year's Eve Awards Discussion Channel.
[425:20.04]Talk about it.
[425:20.98]Go over them.
[425:22.62]The New Year's Eve Nominations Channel is only...
[425:26.55]It is not a discussion channel.
[425:28.21]I'm going to put rules there and I'm going to pin a message there so you can see and you can read the rules there.
[425:32.50]Basically, we want category, what the category is, and then a short sentence or so why you think it should be there.
[425:46.70]Best feet.
[425:50.24]I've showed my feet on camera once and it was because I was in a dunk tank.
[425:56.28]That one.
[426:02.18]Why did I read that?
[426:03.49]Because like 50 people have been saying it.
[426:10.19]Alright.
[426:10.95]That's it.
[426:12.11]There are your categories.
[426:14.63]So as of... As of some point early next week...
[426:25.13]I'd say... I want to give... I want to be able to have plenty of time to put together the videos for the nominations.
[426:34.55]So... I'm gonna say... Let's see, how many days do you guys need?
[426:41.07]Like six?
[426:41.83]Seven?
[426:43.46]One, two, three, four, five... I'd say by like early... By late next week.
[426:52.58]Because then that would mean...
[426:55.41]That would give 1, 2, 3, 4, about 5 days to make the videos.
[426:59.63]Yeah, so as of Thursday... As of Thursday night, at midnight... There is no... We're not taking nominations anymore.
[427:20.73]Because I want to give at least one, two, three full days of being able to put these videos together.
[427:30.62]Thursday was two days ago.
[427:32.36]Well, now it's six days from now.
[427:38.22]Oh, you know, I think, no, we can handle it.
[427:39.78]We can handle it.
[427:40.42]We can handle it.
[427:41.62]I'm going to, I'm going to like hire a few people to do this.
[427:43.92]So, alright.
[427:45.14]27, 27.
[427:54.61]As of Friday the 27th, at midnight, you can no longer send in any nominations.
[428:03.83]That'll give three full days.
[428:05.05]I'm going to bring on at least four or five people to edit this stuff.
[428:09.21]So we can make sure we can get it out.
[428:10.81]So just about, so almost, almost seven days from right now.
[428:22.09]And you know what?
[428:22.45]That's the end of the stream.
[428:23.48]Yeah, that's like... That's it.
[428:25.48]I'm not going back to Nancy Drew right now.
[428:27.55]That does not happen.
[428:28.67]It's like seven and a half hours.
[428:34.99]Maybe I'll pick up... How do I save the game?
[428:39.95]Alright.
[428:41.35]After we do AI Dungeon tomorrow, maybe I'll just finish this.
[428:44.80]Because that's the plan tomorrow.
[428:45.64]We're going to do AI Dungeon.
[428:48.70]Best Nancy Drew Betrayal.
[428:51.70]I'll be left tomorrow.
[428:57.15]Yeah, that's the first time I've saved the game in seven hours.
[428:58.87]That's insane.
[429:01.19]Alright, that's it.
[429:04.85]I did save it already.
[429:05.45]Alright, let me turn this shit off.
[429:13.90]Best Druid Crew Breakdown.
[429:20.17]It should be a lot of fun, though.
[429:22.73]I might try to get a few other surprises done for that stream.
[429:27.23]There's been a lot of stuff going on.
[429:30.81]Last year, that was a ton of fun.
[429:34.03]I loved everything about the worst of the year stuff.
[429:41.88]It will absolutely be fun.
[429:44.98]What day is that stream going to be?
[429:46.92]That stream will be on New Year's Eve, December 31st.
[429:52.15]We will probably start, because I want to drop the ball like I did last year on... What did I do last year?
[429:59.36]Did I do Eastern?
[430:00.18]The ball drop Eastern?
[430:01.02]Or did I do ball drop Pacific?
[430:04.24]I think I did Eastern, didn't I?
[430:09.77]So it wouldn't be insanely late.
[430:13.46]So the stream will probably start around 7 p.m.
[430:18.51]Eastern.
[430:19.71]Right?
[430:20.41]Or like... No, no, no.
[430:21.81]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[430:24.55]9 p.m.
[430:24.79]Eastern?
[430:25.73]Give us a few hours?
[430:28.30]Yeah.
[430:29.64]So that stream will start at 9 p.m.
[430:31.64]Eastern.
[430:33.48]6 p.m.
[430:33.80]Pacific.
[430:37.60]On December 31st.
[430:38.50]And we're gonna go through like we did last year and have the ball drop and...
[430:42.85]Go over the worst and best stuff of the year.
[430:49.23]But, for tomorrow... See you in AI Dungeon.
[430:55.14]And maybe finishing Drew Crew.
[431:06.71]Green screen doctor camping hype.
[431:10.27]Yeah, I'll try to get some stuff made.
[431:17.40]But let's do the bits and the subs and everything.
[431:20.12]And then we'll be back tomorrow.
[431:24.75]Let's rewind.

[431:27.49]Back.
[431:27.95]Back.

[431:35.37]There was a shitload of community subs.
[431:36.95]There was a couple 20s.
[431:37.45]There was a 60.
[431:37.71]There were 3 plus 100 community subs tonight.
[431:48.73]A lot.
[431:53.71]But we covered, I think, most of them.
[431:55.13]Hopefully I got them all.
[431:58.42]And we're going to start with Cruel.
[432:00.16]Cruel gave 300 bits.
[432:01.06]They just say hi.
[432:03.86]Hi, Cruel.
[432:07.16]KO Legacy.
[432:07.97]I think I caught it, but you gave 10 community subs right at the beginning of the stream.
[432:11.09]I want to make sure I got it.
[432:13.85]DarkSoul, thanks for the $2.50.
[432:14.83]Hey guys, back at you again with another bit donation.

[434:00.13]Gonna make them sing the birthday song to me.
[434:04.83]I've been around since your Judge Dredd video, and I'm glad you took my Nancy Drew suggestion, because we all now have Drew fever.
[434:11.47]You and your community bring so much to my life, in a time where I acclimate to adulthood.
[434:18.98]I mean, Drew Crew.
[434:19.94]We've got to represent the Drew Crew.
[434:23.26]Happy birthday.
[434:26.14]Red Robin's the hamburger place, right?
[434:29.46]It goes, Red Robin, yum!
[434:31.88]Right?
[434:33.88]I actually don't think I've ever eaten at Red Robin.
[434:39.40]Being an adult sucks sometimes, it's true.
[434:41.23]Happy birthday.
[434:43.27]Yeah, it's...
[434:46.35]You just learn... You learn to kind of grow.
[434:51.05]I'm still doing it.
[434:55.13]But... Is Kim singing?
[435:01.34]Kim is like scream singing downstairs.
[435:06.62]I just hear like...
[435:15.66]I can hear it.
[435:19.38]Best singing moment.
[435:25.75]Nominate for best singing.
[435:27.07]You guys couldn't even hear it properly.
[435:31.61]Uh, but... Acclimate to adulthood slow.
[435:35.23]Take your time.
[435:38.48]There's no rush.
[435:41.86]Thank you so much for your 500 bits.
[435:45.61]That's fine.
[435:48.47]Thanks for the 600 points.
[435:49.93]What you guys know is that translates into fucking streamer money.
[435:53.13]It does not.
[435:55.73]Yes!
[435:55.85]I wonder how many people actually came in.
[436:16.76]I looked, like, absolutely... I looked haggard.
[436:21.99]You know?
[436:22.41]I looked like, I looked like Hagrid.
[436:25.27]Wait, does Hagrid drink?
[436:31.49]No.
[436:31.65]I don't think so.
[436:32.56]I think maybe he does.
[436:35.60]Butterbeer, yeah.
[436:37.62]I looked real bad.
[436:38.70]I wonder how many people actually are really concerned they came and they left.
[436:42.72]Because they were like, oof, yikes, this is a stream I don't want to be on tonight.
[436:51.06]Turned me drunk out of- Hold on, is this it?
[436:53.04]Let me see.
[436:57.64]Somebody's been at- ...drank more.
[437:02.19]Somebody's been that person.
[437:12.19]This does look real bad.
[437:21.93]Person it's I just I have the stained mouth.
[437:25.54]It looks so bad Alright, let's keep going Drunk, okay.

[438:06.48]Thank you, though.
[438:07.48]Uh, thank you, Lizard Amiibo, for the 300 bits.
[438:10.16]I was going to write something more sincere, but fuck it.
[438:11.84]I just want to say that this is the hardest.
[438:13.00]That was the hardest I've ever laughed in a long time.
[438:16.64]Thanks for always keeping it wacky.
[438:18.00]And I did wacky in a bunch of cool text.
[438:22.50]JermaSucks, thanks for the 250.
[438:23.80]This guy eats lipstick.
[438:24.94]LOLW.
[438:26.91]Thanks for 250 again, JermaSucks.
[438:28.43]God, I hate this gamers.
[438:30.87]God, I hate gamers.

[438:37.95]And thanks for a huge amount of subs.
[438:39.61]Thank you, MichaelSmells, for the 300 bits.

[438:48.25]Please, we love you, but please.
[438:50.53]What?
[438:50.79]I did a wall.
[438:52.45]Thank you Hank Cheesecake for the five community subs.
[438:57.94]Sad Vega thanks for the 250.
[438:59.32]Drew Crew.
[439:00.14]You can't fool me.
[439:00.90]I see what's going on here.
[439:02.34]This isn't a crew.
[439:02.98]It's a cult.
[439:04.08]And I'll have nothing to do with it.
[439:08.68]It's not a cult.
[439:10.18]It's a group of people that come together that are not part of any type of religion or any... We just get together and we play the same game together.
[439:21.56]What is the definition of a cult?
[439:24.66]What's the actual... A system of religious... Yeah, we're not a religion.
[439:28.49]Sorry.
[439:31.33]The Drew Crew is not a religion.
[439:33.67]So... Sorry.
[439:39.31]DarkSoul, thanks for the $2.50.
[439:40.65]Millionaire streamer steals Nancy Drew Drew Crew tagline from local chatter.
[439:45.00]See you in court.
[439:45.66]Hope you put on your best lipstick and kill your money goodbye, you sicko.
[439:54.14]Hey, Brawluck, thanks for the 500 bits.
[439:55.54]You didn't have to go to fucking law school to answer the three-part video game prompt.
[440:02.75]What?
[440:03.07]What do you mean?
[440:10.55]Failcakes, thanks for the 700 bits.
[440:14.37]There's no message.
[440:14.97]They just say Pride 100 seven times.
[440:18.27]Thank you, Failcakes.
[440:19.63]Thank you so much for the 700 bits.
[440:24.61]You wrote kiss?
[440:27.85]No, you wrote kill.
[440:30.64]Put on your best lipstick and kill your money goodbye.
[440:33.58]It's kill.
[440:36.06]Thanks for the 700 bits fail cakes, though.
[440:38.31]Damn.
[440:40.89]Hey, Squim PST, thanks for the thousand bits.
[440:44.37]Hey, Jerm, wanted to say thanks for making the Drew Crew thing in your streams.
[440:48.11]Me and my sisters have a tradition of playing the Nancy Drew games every year at the holidays for as long as I can remember, so thanks for bringing back my childhood.
[440:55.50]Welcome to the crew.
[440:58.86]I flew off the handle during that red light, green light, light up the white light segment.
[441:04.95]Didn't I say that 27 of these games were worthless or something?
[441:08.39]I was really mean.
[441:11.29]I'm supposed to be the leader of the crew, and I said like every one of their games is terrible or something.
[441:16.21]This is why nobody talks to me.
[441:19.25]I can't like... Oh, dude, I wonder if like Jerma talks to any game companies.
[441:22.75]No, no, they don't.
[441:23.81]Nobody... They won't talk to me.
[441:28.97]That'll never happen.
[441:32.15]Dude, does Jerma have like any sponsorship opportunities with a couple of companies?
[441:36.42]They probably watched the Xbox 360 Red Dead rant and they probably are like, holy fuck, don't close that window.
[441:51.83]Old Navy gaming.
[441:57.02]But yeah, welcome to the crew.
[441:59.12]Thank you, SquimPSD.
[442:00.44]Nancy Drew is a classic.
[442:02.80]All of them.
[442:05.79]You're not you when you haven't had your cheesy toasties.
[442:09.83]Aw, that's so sad.
[442:11.79]It's true, though.
[442:14.09]Proof he hates games.
[442:15.63]Let's see.
[442:17.49]Now I know this one.
[442:18.11]This is when I say that... I thought that was edited for a second.
[442:20.97]Not edited.
[442:21.37]Somehow.
[442:21.59]Listen to that part right there.
[442:36.60]Is that even possible for a human to do that?
[442:38.70]Okay.
[442:39.70]Okay.
[442:40.30]Okay.
[442:41.00]Okay.
[442:46.02]Maybe it is.
[442:50.12]Video games suck.
[442:51.40]Video games suck.
[442:52.56]Video games suck.
[442:53.71]Video games suck.
[442:55.03]All video games.
[442:55.87]None of them are fun.
[442:57.57]That's not even a meltdown.
[442:58.47]That's just me speaking facts.
[443:03.24]Hey Sikilos. Sikilos thanks for the 500 bits.
[443:10.24]"Jerma I recently bought Red Dead Redemption on Xbox with backwards compatibility but it says I don't have a card on file. Do you have any experience with this issue? I know you played it on stream".
[443:20.24]I didn't even read this one, until right now. This is from 2 hours ago by the way. I just saw this right now.
[443:33.01]I don't have a card on file.
[443:34.29]Why would you have to have a card on file?
[443:36.33]I still don't get that.
[443:39.21]I want to buy something from your store.
[443:42.04]Okay, please put a card in so we can store it and then buy it.
[443:46.52]Just let me buy it.
[443:47.80]You sure you don't want to store the card and then buy it?
[443:53.78]Here we go again.
[443:57.99]We had 120 community subs come in in 30 seconds of each other.
[444:03.07]Anonymous gave 100.
[444:05.01]Whoever you are, thank you for your insane contribution.
[444:07.85]And then NatKitty gave 20 right after it.
[444:15.04]Thanks, guys.
[444:18.06]And why don't we take a look at how fast this is going to fly by?
[444:21.20]Because they were a shitload of community subs.
[444:22.82]Let's just bump you here quick.
[444:24.72]Sorry about that.
[444:26.74]Let's run them.
[444:29.99]Good luck reading those.
[444:32.08]It's hundreds of people.
[444:34.70]Thank you, guys.
[444:36.20]And thanks to the people that for some reason drop huge, huge amounts of money on this stream.
[444:42.86]Much love to you.
[444:43.48]Thank you.
[444:45.48]Thanks for continuing to allow me to do the things that I do.
[444:48.28]The things that I want to do.
[444:50.80]Am I ever going to watch Joel's movie?
[444:52.35]Maybe a few years.
[444:55.05]It's not done yet, I heard.
[445:02.88]But seriously.
[445:04.40]It's a lot of people.
[445:05.54]Thank you guys.
[445:07.46]We still have a few more bits to do.
[445:08.54]We have future gamer for 250.
[445:11.16]Insane cannibal caught on stream.
[445:16.67]What the fuck?
[445:19.75]This is actually kind of scary.
[445:28.15]Look at this scary image.
[445:36.86]Not that one.
[445:38.04]Not that one.
[445:38.56]It's a different one.
[445:39.14]I mean, that's also pretty scary.
[445:49.18]Do you see him?
[445:56.21]Do you see?
[445:57.83]Where is he?
[446:04.29]I see him.
[446:08.21]Enhance it?
[446:08.71]I will.
[446:08.91]I just don't want to cover up the sub.
[446:15.44]Wow, before we do that... That was FutureGamer's image.
[446:20.60]We also have 250 from Buttsquire, who has a couple of images.
[446:24.41]There's me as the Joker.
[446:32.56]I do, I feel like you did, did you enhance this?
[446:35.06]Here, find me, find me.
[446:36.58]Okay, so where is he?
[446:37.96]I think I see him.
[446:48.95]Here's another one to look at.
[446:49.83]Yep.
[446:58.31]Yep.
[446:59.69]Mm-hmm.
[447:02.47]Okay, that was from Buttsquire.
[447:04.46]Thank you, Buttsquire.
[447:05.86]Very nice.
[447:06.46]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[447:07.70]I dreamed that I was sitting on a public toilet and I heard you talking in the adjacent stall about how global warming is killing elephants.
[447:15.83]I was surprised to say the least.
[447:17.09]Also, any thoughts on doing Twitch Sings?
[447:20.82]I will do Twitch sings after New Year's, because I just put a category for best and worst singing on stream.
[447:28.86]And I feel like if I do that stream before the New Year's, that'll take up every single slot.
[447:35.01]So, maybe.
[447:38.61]But thank you for the thousand bits.
[447:39.71]Ten bucks from VeryNoise.
[447:41.35]Thank you.
[447:43.49]Appreciate that.
[447:46.26]Uh, Snooze and Cocter, thanks for the $2.50.
[447:47.74]I was curious if you could imagine the taste this would have.
[447:51.04]Because for the weirdest reason I do, everyone that had one of those old TVs probably can.
[447:56.90]Try it.
[447:57.34]Can I taste this?
[448:03.31]Let's see.
[448:03.75]Can I taste this?
[448:04.79]Alright, uh...
[448:19.10]Taste this.
[448:21.52]I can smell this.
[448:23.26]It smells like electricity.
[448:26.08]Do you guys know that kind of heavy electricity, almost metallic smell?
[448:32.22]That electricity smell?
[448:36.76]I know that there's people that can't... I think some people can't sense that, right?
[448:42.96]Like ozone.
[448:43.56]It's like that ozone smell.
[448:44.94]That ozone in your nostrils and in the back of your throat.
[448:51.12]Yeah, I can taste this image.
[448:53.16]Yep.
[448:55.64]Uh, any chance you're also going to revisit The Sims with new mods?
[448:59.62]Maybe one of the older Sims games, too, because they have other wacky mods.
[449:05.65]Um... I feel like I did the sequel.
[449:08.87]I did The Sims 4, and then I did The Sims 4 sequel.
[449:11.85]I feel like if I want to do that again, I would probably go back to one of the older ones and do something ridiculous.
[449:20.13]Because I've never really played The Sims 2 or The Sims 3 on stream.
[449:24.59]But yeah, I thought about it.
[449:26.13]That's what I was asking.
[449:28.41]Oh, yeah.
[449:28.83]Yes.
[449:30.23]Yes.
[449:32.07]Hey, 25, Dr. Pepper.
[449:33.51]Over 25 flavors in Dr. Pepper.
[449:35.33]Thanks for the $2.50.
[449:36.19]Worst impression goes to Ed Stark.
[449:37.80]You're not going to do it.
[449:39.22]I don't think that was this year.
[449:41.08]I think that may have been two years ago.
[449:47.83]Too many bits to do, and then we're going to take off.
[449:50.23]See you tomorrow for AI Dungeon and maybe some more Nancy Drew crew.
[449:58.15]Esparta Escalada, thanks for the $2.50.
[449:59.69]Hey, Jerma, I had an awful Christmas celebration with my family today, and your streams always cheer me up when I feel bad.
[450:05.45]I just want to say thanks.
[450:07.09]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[450:13.04]Nobody deserves to have a shitty Christmas.
[450:16.46]I'm sorry to hear that.
[450:20.60]Regardless of however you celebrate it.
[450:21.90]I know some people do it a few days early, some people do it a few days after.
[450:25.04]Family travels, I understand, I get it.
[450:29.12]I'm sorry to hear that, but if this stream can cheer you up, I'm happy it can.
[450:41.07]Very happy.
[450:45.83]Can we get one more JermaWink before you leave?
[450:47.87]Nah, I've removed my shirt.
[450:49.53]It's off.
[450:50.39]I had to take it off.
[450:51.07]I'm like, I got lipstick all over it.
[450:56.50]But thank you, Espada Escalada.
[450:58.94]Anything else show official thanks to the 500 bits.
[451:01.32]Not encouraging your Nancy Drew.
[451:02.98]Here's some stuff that is not encouraging your Nancy Drew stream.
[451:07.24]Also just posted some images and projects in the Discord for you.
[451:13.76]What on Earth is going on here?
[451:16.36]Alright, this is... I like this one.
[451:22.20]This one is also a scary image.
[451:23.82]We got fucking scary images.
[451:33.04]This one is the scary one.
[451:34.86]We'll just do that one now.
[451:39.70]It's very large.
[451:40.48]This is in Blender, so you probably can guess what this is going to be.
[451:51.28]Jesus Christ.
[451:58.13]What's wrong with my eyes?
[452:04.25]Confirmed bald.
[452:11.89]The more I look at it, the more I feel like it's staring into me.
[452:15.63]I have to get it off the screen.
[452:25.99]Is the other one.
[452:36.90]God damn it.
[452:44.75]And we also have from Tingey.
[452:48.77]Thank you, Tingey, for the 250.
[452:54.16]And they say...
[452:56.27]What's the thing you say?
[452:57.13]I'm still hoping you can get that RollerCross Tycoon 2 mod working where we're the guests in the park.
[453:02.81]I don't think you can.
[453:06.40]Because... From what I understand, it's just not... It just doesn't work anymore.
[453:13.58]It's just not on anymore.
[453:15.28]The server is turned off and I would have to make my own server to host it or something?
[453:26.06]I think that was what we came to the conclusion of.
[453:27.58]I can host it.
[453:28.78]I can host it.
[453:29.38]I can host it.
[453:31.66]There was a lot more to it.
[453:32.80]And it was going to take probably another few days to figure that out.
[453:37.43]But... I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
[453:40.19]We're going to do AI Dungeon.
[453:43.71]This stream was very strange.
[453:47.76]I feel like this was like six streams.
[453:50.32]Because I'm thinking about the activities that were done and the things that happened on this stream.
[453:54.14]And I feel like that was over the course of the last, like, four days.
[453:58.18]That was a lot of different streams together.
[454:01.06]I was, like, changing channels in my brain.
[454:05.86]Alright.
[454:10.42]Goodnight, guys.
[454:10.90]I'll see you tomorrow.
[454:11.78]AI Dungeon may be finishing up Nancy Drew.
[454:14.44]For the Drew crew.
[454:16.58]Goodnight.
[454:17.64]See you tomorrow.
[454:37.26]you
