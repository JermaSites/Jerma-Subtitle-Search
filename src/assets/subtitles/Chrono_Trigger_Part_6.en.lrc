[ve:61.1.100]

[00:08.77]How you doing?
[00:09.17]Alright, let's turn it down a little.
[00:16.23]Probably not going to be live for that much longer.
[00:18.09]I do want to kind of get to the end of this little arc in Chrono Trigger.
[00:23.97]Maybe like another 20, 30 minutes or so.
[00:26.23]I'm getting hungry.
[00:27.91]But I do want to see this through.
[00:32.94]He just joined us on the Chrono Trigger playthrough.
[00:37.04]Something very bad just happened.
[00:46.63]We just lost Chrono.
[00:47.87]I don't know if that's a spoiler for you, but we did.
[00:55.17]And we need to figure out what to do now.
[00:58.24]Chrono is no longer alive.
[01:03.25]I'm going to prove it.
[01:04.95]You don't see him listed here, do you?
[01:09.93]But it's okay.
[01:11.05]So I think... Let me refresh my memory.
[01:13.83]I believe... We have to go... We have our ship.
[01:18.19]We have our time machine.
[01:19.63]Let me refill all my stuff.
[01:25.73]I got a ton of money.
[01:28.42]Buy a thousand of these.
[01:34.47]Yeah.
[01:34.99]Spoilers, um... You know what?
[01:38.05]Give me 20.
[01:39.37]I'm spending money here.
[01:40.19]Give me 20 high potions.
[01:42.95]Give me another five of these.
[01:45.22]Give me another few shelters.
[01:46.12]I've been holding onto this money for, like, the entire playthrough.
[01:50.56]These ethers are so expensive!
[01:54.80]Do I only have, like, none?
[02:03.71]I feel like I should have more than that.
[02:12.84]Oh, there we go.
[02:15.82]Magic capsule.
[02:17.86]Check back from time to time.
[02:18.66]He sells whatever washes up here.
[02:20.10]So if you wait a while, he'll most likely have some new things.
[02:22.56]Okay.
[02:28.15]Anything else in these villages?
[02:30.98]I think you can kind of get what might be happening here Might as well...
[03:02.47]Okay.
[03:05.33]I'm gonna go to the end of time.
[03:06.73]What's on the North Cape here?
[03:15.18]Nothing.
[03:15.52]I think you come back here.
[03:16.74]Can I... Can I get into this?
[03:24.21]I didn't like screw myself, did I?
[03:31.96]It's in a very weird spot.
[03:42.97]That is a weird spot, isn't it?
[03:44.05]Should we go through the commons?
[04:00.46]We've grown too dependent on that fearsome force.
[04:04.80]The sun never rises on the morrow.
[04:06.04]There's little we can do but live for today.
[04:07.54]Oh, right, right, right.
[04:08.91]Okay.
[04:09.11]Yeah, because we were just in the middle of some crazy shit just happened.
[04:13.89]Okay.
[04:16.55]Feeling better, are we?
[04:19.23]Bow, Charles, and pay homage to your new liege, King Dalton.
[04:24.46]That's right.
[04:25.00]Dalton is still here.
[04:33.02]Fight!
[04:33.22]Oh, that ship outside must be yours then, mustn't it?
[04:43.23]It matches Balthazar's designs perfectly.
[05:04.60]You're undeserving of such splendid toys.
[05:07.14]I shall make it my personal chariot.
[05:11.29]Surely you jape.
[05:14.75]You've come... You will have... You will have to come with me.
[05:19.07]It would do... It would not do to have you whispering strange secrets in the ears of this mob.
[05:25.12]You might start a rebellion.
[05:27.40]I'm not high.
[05:28.12]I'm just... I'm tired.
[05:43.70]I still have this... I have this image over here of this fucking guy in a Halloween costume with his dick out.
[06:00.65]It's on the other screen.
[06:10.89]Wear this!
[06:13.85]Our equipment has been taken!
[06:16.98]Other stuff, too?
[06:19.20]Confounded!
[06:19.92]Our money, too!
[06:22.10]Isla still can fight!
[06:23.02]Go find a weapon!
[06:23.78]Fight, bad man!
[06:24.54]Let's go fuck him up.
[06:31.97]The new king.
[06:32.65]Maybe I'll go down first.
[06:37.83]They're like watching sheep.
[06:38.81]They can't try anything without weapons.
[06:40.57]I don't need weapons.
[06:44.95]Oh, dear.
[06:47.97]Sky.
[06:49.03]Sky!
[06:49.47]A blackbird?
[06:55.61]Yeah, we're on the- we're on the plane.
[07:02.36]Do we jump?
[07:07.02]Hmm?
[07:09.49]Take a look.
[07:09.97]I mean, we're going to kill them anyway, so...
[07:38.36]There's probably items in here that I need.
[07:43.76]I can't wait to hear the sound.
[07:44.70]It definitely happens.
[07:50.07]It's going to happen here like 10 times.
[07:58.03]Cool.
[08:03.56]How do I get out?
[08:04.12]I think it's up.
[08:09.29]Ooh.
[08:13.11]Oh, got frogs equipment.
[08:16.69]Excellent.
[08:21.90]Don't wake anybody.
[08:22.84]I think I should go down each one of these.
[08:24.00]Hmm, if not.
[08:33.64]Is there another one?
[08:36.46]Yeah, there's one here.
[08:50.84]How do I get over there?
[08:51.72]Like this.
[09:01.09]Oh shit.
[09:02.93]What are you doing?
[09:04.93]Well at least we got frog stuff.
[09:09.75]He'll kill everybody.
[09:14.90]This game's got a nice soundtrack.
[09:16.30]XLR is really comforting.
[09:19.54]I mean, this is probably one of my favorite games of all time.
[09:24.30]The soundtrack is great.
[09:25.65]The art is great.
[09:27.11]Kinda can't go wrong.
[09:38.35]We know.
[09:38.75]Well, how do you know?
[09:43.33]It's not like I talk about it all the time, right?
[09:44.93]Hold on, I want to hear it.
[09:47.33]Yeah.
[09:47.99]Oh, I didn't get the whole thing.
[09:55.73]Is there a completely different dialog in each cutscene depending on who is in the party?
[09:58.82]Yes.
[10:01.38]Each character has their own reactions to stuff.
[10:06.06]Although it's pretty similar.
[10:07.08]It follows the same kind of script.
[10:08.08]It is different.
[10:09.76]It is different enough.
[10:23.83]Now that you mention that, that is actually kind of crazy.
[10:32.55]You kind of have to write the story eight different times in a way.
[10:39.26]Or have eight different reactions.
[10:41.10]I've been going... Wait, who just got a... Was it Robo?
[10:46.12]There's Robo.
[10:47.46]Wait, was it items?
[10:49.47]I didn't see it.
[10:50.57]Yep.
[10:52.49]It was really good for its time.
[10:53.72]Oh yeah.
[10:57.94]Some stuff still gone.
[10:58.88]No need.
[10:59.44]Oh, go back.
[11:00.08]Yeah.
[11:00.44]What the hell am I doing?
[11:09.47]If you like that, you should play the Trails series.
[11:13.11]I don't know how... I don't know if I would like a whole lot of other RPGs like this.
[11:19.19]Maybe I would.
[11:32.37]I think it's just for me, it's... Here's the way, here's the checklist that I have to do for me to like a RPG, a turn-based RPG.
[11:44.90]I've said it a couple times.
[11:46.80]It cannot be random battles.
[11:49.29]That drives me absolutely bonkers.
[11:51.09]I hate it.
[11:55.45]There needs to be a ton of upgrades.
[12:01.13]The more upgrades, the better.
[12:04.88]I like when a game has money to spend.
[12:07.70]I like spending money and buying stuff.
[12:09.10]And oh, I buy that and buy that.
[12:10.04]I know that's in most of them, but... I like weapon upgrades.
[12:16.70]I like armor upgrades.
[12:20.60]Pretend to be sick.
[12:23.55]I see.
[12:23.91]We will catch the guard off guard.
[12:27.65]System error.
[12:28.27]Cannot read boot sector.
[12:29.51]Abort, retry, fail.
[12:30.77]Please help.
[12:33.60]What's the matter?
[12:36.17]Works every time.
[12:38.65]It appears our plan succeeded.
[12:43.74]It is really hard to recommend Chrono Cross because it is not the same game.
[12:47.64]It is not even in the same ballpark.
[12:52.20]If you took the word Chrono and just called it Cross, the name of the game was just Cross.
[12:59.32]I don't think you'd even know it was connected to this series.
[13:02.42]At least in the first few hours of playing it.
[13:15.71]It's still a good game.
[13:16.61]It's still a great game.
[13:18.39]You just have to kind of get over all the... the rough edges.
[13:34.77]That's good.
[13:36.88]There it is, alright.
[13:37.76]That should be it.
[13:40.46]Chrono Cross is top tier, the haters just don't know all the deep lore.
[13:43.06]I think that's the problem with Chrono Cross.
[13:48.38]There's too many layers of deep lore.
[13:53.29]I think for the most part, I kind of just want a group of heroes to save the world.
[14:00.97]And then when you have a group of heroes, save the world.
[14:03.99]And then... Okay, so here's... So Chrono Cross, to me, is... You know in, like, every anime, or every, like, a lot of major animes, where when you get to, like, episode 50, they start... Did we already talk about this?
[14:18.26]We probably did.
[14:19.60]They start to have to fight, like, ten different versions of God, and there's, like, all these layers, and this crazy shit happens, and there's this crazy thing on top of this fucking crazy thing.
[14:28.45]And by the way...
[14:29.95]There's another planet and it explodes and that planet exploded and and... It's like the first episode we were just kind of hanging out drinking tea.
[14:40.22]And now we have to fight like a 700 foot tall god.
[14:45.92]It's just kind of more and more extravagant, extravagant, extravagant, extravagant layers.
[14:53.78]When Chrono Trigger really is kind of just save the world.
[14:59.17]Just, hey, save the world.
[15:06.30]It's not save the world and then.
[15:07.66]Save the world and then and then and then and then and then.
[15:11.18]It gets really overcomplicated, that's right, yeah.
[15:16.45]I think I got everything.
[15:25.63]Let's heal.
[15:33.14]Why do I even still have these?
[15:38.86]I'm just gonna use... I'll just get rid of them.
[15:40.27]They're just taking up space.
[15:51.91]Where's the exit?
[15:52.51]I just had it.
[15:54.41]But yeah, I... It's not that I don't like it when stuff like that happens, but it does get a little... I don't know, hard to pay attention to is, I guess, maybe...
[16:06.26]Did I not get Rubble's equipment?
[16:18.14]Oh shit, we still don't have his equipment.
[16:19.50]Where is it?
[16:20.56]It's down here.
[16:21.04]There it is.
[16:35.95]But Chrono Cros- I guess the point I'm making there is, Chrono Cross... ...is so outrageous... ...and so overcomplicated... ...that it really just doesn't even feel like it's part of the same universe.
[16:51.78]And without spoiling that game... ...they kinda, like... ...tied everything kind of- is tied together into the same franchise... ...eventually.
[17:05.08]Doesn't feel like a sequel for a lot of it.
[17:15.27]How did I miss Robo's gear all this whole time?
[17:26.89]If you check out Radical Dreamers.
[17:29.10]No, I bought the... I got the whole thing where it was like they did the rem... The ports... Well, it wasn't a remake.
[17:36.89]They ported Chrono Cross to the current consoles.
[17:41.57]I think at least it was PlayStation or PS5 or something.
[17:45.63]And it included Radical Dreamers.
[17:47.27]And I still kind of just didn't get it.
[17:50.50]I was like, ah, I guess maybe I'll play it.
[17:51.64]I'm such a huge fan.
[17:53.26]It's so weird to be such a huge fan of one part of the franchise.
[17:58.10]It almost feels, I feel guilty in a way.
[18:04.99]I love this game so much and I like this franchise so much, but apparently, do I?
[18:10.65]Because I don't really love Chrono Cross and I've never really cared about Radical Dreamers.
[18:15.90]Weird.
[18:16.04]Weird.
[18:22.42]It's like Beast Wars.
[18:28.49]I worry that will be me when Night Rain comes out.
[18:30.31]Here's how you can make sure that Night Rain is still interesting to you.
[18:34.04]It's just extra stuff.
[18:38.30]I think that's actually what FromSoftware's philosophy on that game probably is.
[18:44.28]Everyone's going to be like, oh my god, it's a new FromSoftware game.
[18:47.26]Here it is.
[18:47.56]It's going to be so crazy.
[18:49.00]I can't wait to fight the 50 bosses.
[18:50.64]And there's going to be a giant crazy story where there's five different million different pieces of lore.
[18:55.76]I think it's just, hey, we made this kind of cool thing.
[18:57.76]Wait, I just learned some stuff.
[19:02.26]I'm taking it as new game plus.
[19:03.52]I'm taking it as extra content.
[19:08.62]Rapid Fire Fist Heal Beam.
[19:12.13]Oh, I got Dino Tail, where I'm about to get it.
[19:16.08]Bubble Burst.
[19:18.44]Cure Wave Boogie.
[19:19.50]Boogie's cool.
[19:21.74]You play Lost Odyssey?
[19:23.12]I actually like that game a lot.
[19:24.98]That's very good.
[19:26.70]The soundtrack is... I love the battle music.
[19:28.16]That battle music is probably some of the best battle music I've ever heard.
[19:37.15]Just the standard battle music for Lost Odyssey.
[19:44.11]Alright, let's go.
[19:51.25]We know the story.
[19:59.12]It's crazy.
[19:59.48]FromSoftware 2 is so interesting because they made like 10 games before Demon's Souls, right?
[20:07.20]Even more than that.
[20:10.79]I wonder what it feels like to have made so much shit and then you just, you hit a jackpot.
[20:19.81]You hit an absolute golden jackpot on an idea.
[20:24.95]This is so cool.
[20:27.72]Like 40.
[20:28.16]They made like 40 games, damn.
[20:31.10]All the armored cores, all the king's fields.
[20:44.53]I got lost already.
[20:45.27]I actually don't remember this section that much at all.
[20:59.30]I've walked into it accidentally too.
[21:00.88]It's up in the vents.
[21:10.48]No.
[21:12.58]Bro, you going in circles?
[21:13.44]Yeah, I'm just kind of talking.
[21:16.42]Where is it?
[21:20.80]It's right here, right?
[21:23.82]I walked into it accidentally.
[21:29.00]It's on the left side of the room.
[21:29.98]Just don't know.
[21:31.45]Gotta get up to the left side.
[21:32.43]Uh, where's Crono?
[21:36.67]Well... Wouldn't you like to know?
[21:51.48]I guess I should go up from here.
[21:56.64]There we are.
[22:01.28]Alright, let's attack.
[22:11.37]Time for the best boss.
[22:21.25]Uh, do I have enough items for this?
[22:24.67]I hope I do.
[22:25.27]I think I'm good.
[22:30.39]We're in good shape, I think.
[22:41.60]I got double tech AoE heals?
[22:43.04]Yeah, that's true.
[22:44.72]I have a ton of healing with this group.
[22:56.91]After this boss, I'm probably gonna call it a night though.
[22:59.09]I gotta get some food in me.
[23:09.41]I never played Golden Sun.
[23:10.29]I knew people that liked it though.
[23:13.64]Way back in the day, like 15 years ago.
[23:15.18]Isn't that what Isaac is from there, right?
[23:21.84]I got that right?
[23:39.38]Oh, well, okay.
[23:42.20]Scream tomorrow.
[23:43.34]Um, um, I don't know.
[23:47.46]This house is going to be pretty vague.
[23:50.14]I'm flying off here.
[23:55.10]Something comes.
[23:57.82]I detect a massive magical energy reaction.
[24:03.43]Oh, shit.
[24:04.19]Not this thing.
[24:07.99]Uh-oh.
[24:15.08]Alright, should I frog squash him right off the bat?
[24:25.89]Nice.
[24:32.97]Let's attack regularly.
[24:36.42]Alright, he's counting down.
[24:37.52]Everyone in full health?
[24:38.26]Good.
[24:39.72]Keep it that way.
[24:41.50]Uh, dino tail.
[24:42.38]Let's do it.
[24:53.45]This frog squash again.
[24:54.41]Everyone alright?
[25:03.38]Maybe I should take a barrier or something.
[25:15.78]I'm kind of terrified, so I'm just going to do this.
[25:17.56]That was so unnecessary, but whatever.
[25:21.85]I'm doing it.
[25:25.43]Paranoid heal ever.
[25:30.77]Oh yeah, frog, it's, uh... He's saying, um?
[25:39.90]Yeah, scales with HP lost.
[25:41.02]That's right.
[25:41.64]Oops.
[25:43.42]Why is he still counting down?
[25:44.52]Wait, I forget what's going on.
[25:49.18]It's actually, it's funny that the last third of this game, I don't remember as much as I remember the first third.
[25:58.00]Holy shit, that was a lot.
[25:58.78]No, no, no, I'm scared.
[26:06.45]Charm?
[26:15.11]I hate heights.
[26:17.61]Oh, okay.
[26:21.62]Got him.
[26:24.08]All the predictions.
[26:34.42]You literally can't die to this boss.
[26:36.32]Oh, no.
[26:37.06]All the doubters.
[26:38.20]See you later.
[26:56.69]I'll never lose.
[26:57.53]I've done it.
[27:01.02]It's complete.
[27:05.39]There it is.
[27:08.27]See these beautiful wings?
[27:09.91]This is a throne truly fit for a king.
[27:11.95]I name it.
[27:14.41]The Ero Dalton Imperial.
[27:16.87]And those meddlesome interlopers shall be her first victims.
[27:21.22]Ero Dalton Imperial, prepare for takeoff.
[27:25.28]No, no, no!
[27:28.22]Stop the music!
[27:31.48]Yes, there we go.
[27:32.20]Nice and evil.
[27:34.42]Now then.
[27:43.60]Errol Dalton Imperial, away.
[27:51.19]There it goes.
[27:53.79]Look!
[28:01.44]The Epoch.
[28:03.14]It can fly?
[28:07.55]My name is not the Epoch, it's the Aerodalton Imperial.
[28:11.41]And you, I'm afraid, are excess baggage.
[28:15.94]Time to make like the wind and blow you all away.
[28:24.24]Yes, squirm about like the worms you are.
[28:28.60]Go, Epoch, now!
[28:31.50]You learn a lesson this day.
[28:32.81]Here we go.
[28:41.48]This is where the real fight begins.
[28:49.44]Ambrosia?
[28:50.20]What is that?
[28:50.68]Oh shit, why did I do that?
[29:03.33]I'm an idiot.
[29:04.55]I just saw the shiny thing and I pressed it.
[29:17.03]Robo is so good.
[29:27.44]Huge.
[29:33.65]Take this.
[29:40.69]Let's do a super heal.
[29:54.65]That's a lot, damn.
[30:04.86]One?
[30:08.18]Same with HP for her too?
[30:09.06]Is it a similar move?
[30:21.64]Gotta read the descriptions, that's right.
[30:31.97]My friend softlocked on this boss on the steam port due to a glitch and Square Enix support literally told him it was a skill issue.
[30:38.78]Wait, really?
[30:47.18]Uh, let's take a look at this.
[30:49.27]Who needs... Oh, I need... Okay.
[30:51.33]Okay.
[31:03.06]They're not wrong.
[31:03.94]Yeah, this is not particularly a hard fight.
[31:09.11]But if you get lazy, you can fuck it up.
[31:33.97]Go, golem overlord!
[31:35.17]Bro.
[31:42.86]Ah, ah, ahhh!
[31:46.42]2,500 experience, 40 TP, 2,000 gold.
[31:50.02]And we're gonna get to hear one of my favorite songs in the game.
[31:55.03]So turn it up.
[31:57.43]That filthy thief!
[31:59.69]Epoch OK?
[32:02.71]More importantly, we need to determine the flight controls before we crash.
[32:08.25]Frog, please press X. No!
[32:25.55]Try A.
[32:31.76]Oh my god!
[32:46.13]Destroyed the Blackbird.
[32:48.63]Justice!
[32:49.61]Dalton's been paid his due!
[32:53.01]Mercy, that ship can fly!
[32:54.46]Turn it up!
[32:58.26]Let's go!
[33:03.24]I should have linked it to my CPU!
[33:09.21]Incredible!
[33:10.31]Perhaps we even owe him a touch of gratitude for this!
[33:14.41]Epoch happy!
[33:15.27]Epoch become bird!
[33:18.32]I believe this is what you refer to as a blessing in the midst of a disaster.
[33:21.52]It may not have been our intent, but we have gained the means to fly.
[33:34.34]We must find Crono regardless of what fate may have befallen him.
[33:41.67]Yeah!
[33:42.55]We got the Epoch.
[33:45.51]And the cool thing about the Epoch, for those that don't know,
[33:49.67]Well, it won't let me do it right now.
[33:51.91]It's fine.
[33:53.59]You can fly anywhere.
[33:54.79]This is where you unlock the whole game.
[33:56.25]The entire video game is now available.
[33:57.95]All the optional areas, all the cool stuff that was inaccessible before is available.
[34:05.15]You can go to any age, any time, anywhere on any map.
[34:08.43]It's really cool.
[34:15.40]And that's where I'm going to stop.
[34:17.49]I did want to get to the end of that arc.
[34:22.35]We are at the final arc of the game.
[34:24.48]This is what is in the future.
[34:26.44]This is the end.
[34:30.38]Still quite a bit left, but we're at the end.
[34:37.05]So now we get a fresh... We're not in that arc.
[34:41.85]Closed it up a little.
[34:44.19]I'll see you guys later.
[34:45.81]Next stream, keep an eye on the sus maybe the next few days.
[34:49.08]Oh my god, I just punched you.
[34:51.56]There'll be a stream in the next few days.
[34:54.00]I don't know when, but when I have a better idea, I'll just show up and be like, hey, what's happening?
[35:06.62]Thanks for watching.
[35:07.10]That was a really fun night.
[35:09.24]Had a great time.
[35:13.29]There were three distinct periods of the stream.
[35:20.55]Kind of all over the place, but it was a lot of fun.
[35:34.91]But yeah.
[35:36.39]Thanks for sticking around.
[35:37.11]Thanks for hanging out.
[35:38.27]Thanks for watching.
[35:39.21]Obviously, thanks to the other horsemen.
[35:42.87]Mr. Poke Vinny.
[35:45.67]Those guys are great.
[35:47.39]Definitely go follow them.
[35:48.43]Go watch them if you don't.
[35:50.15]They all make great, great, great stuff.
[35:56.79]Take care of yourselves.
[35:57.61]Have a great night.
[35:58.59]Goodbye.
[35:59.35]Get on the phone and call your mother, you know, if you haven't in a while.
[36:08.44]Obviously, thanks for the subs.
[36:13.15]Credits.
[36:14.69]Do want to say thank you.
[36:20.40]And we'll see.
[36:35.63]Call my mother at 10 p.m.
[36:37.45]Well, I mean at your next earliest convenience at a reasonable hour.
[36:40.96]Alright.
[36:50.40]See you later.
[36:52.08]I'll make sure the game saved up.
[36:53.12]We can start this again another day.
[36:54.96]See you later.
