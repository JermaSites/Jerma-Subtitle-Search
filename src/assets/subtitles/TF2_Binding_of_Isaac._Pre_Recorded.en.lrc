[00:47.71]Can you guys hear that?
[00:49.83]Okay.
[00:52.23]Good to know, because that means that I set the audio cable thing up correctly.

[02:24.03]There it is!
[02:26.04]Hello, phone?
[02:26.76]Alright.
[02:30.46]Alright.
[02:36.74]Oh, if you're watching this on YouTube, like eventually when I upload this tomorrow, if you're watching this on YouTube, you go ahead and you can skip like two or three minutes while I set this up.
[02:44.73]I know I put an annotation there, but sometimes people go, whoa, when do you start?
[02:49.43]So go ahead and skip a couple minutes if you're watching this on the YouTubes.
[02:55.29]Okay.
[02:56.63]Twitter.
[02:57.49]Hello, Twitter.
[03:00.81]So yeah, Team Fortress 2 and Binding of Isaac 2.
[03:04.43]And you're probably wondering, why am I playing that crazy, ridiculous, disturbing game?
[03:08.67]Well, because there's DLC for it coming out in like a couple days.
[03:12.42]So I want to get back into it, because I love that game.
[03:16.18]So let's see.

[03:38.10]http://www.twitch.tv Don't ask me why I always do this on my phone.
[03:56.75]I just don't feel like opening up another tab.
[03:59.08]This is probably faster if I did it on my damn computer.
[04:04.80]There's that.
[04:06.19]Alright.
[04:07.29]Ready to go here in a second.
[04:08.47]Just going to put a Steam message out to the Steam community.

[04:15.26]New name, apparently.

[04:22.16]Well, that's one way to have your name be.
[04:24.78]Whatever.
[04:27.01]Massive Bus Accident.
[04:33.37]Oh, man.
[04:43.61]Oh, why do I think that's so funny?
[04:54.02]Oh, screaming now.

[05:21.21]I'll change that.
[05:25.95]Yeah, open mouthedness.
[05:29.42]Party.
[05:31.68]Fifteen minutes.
[05:34.54]Alright.
[05:34.92]Oh, my God.
[05:37.77]Oh, no.
[05:39.55]Oh, no.
[05:41.37]I just, like, dumped a drink on my floor.
[05:45.62]Oh, God.
[05:46.54]Oh.
[05:53.08]You know what?
[05:53.52]It's staying there.
[05:54.70]It's staying there.
[05:57.06]I'll deal with it later.
[05:59.29]God.
[06:01.05]What a pro.
[06:06.17]Oh, okay.
[06:08.64]There's like a cup of milk on my floor right now.
[06:11.08]That is not cool.
[06:12.98]Whatever.
[06:13.96]The show must go on.
[06:15.40]Let's do it.
[06:21.53]That's that.
[06:24.85]And here's the tweet.
[06:29.41]I can't believe that.
[06:32.87]Milk does a body good.
[06:34.13]Unless you dump it on your floor.
[06:39.67]Jeez Louise.
[06:46.06]Does that work?
[06:46.72]Let's find out.
[06:48.38]Nice like Avatar.
[06:52.90]Alright.
[06:53.94]We're good to go.
[06:55.10]We're good to go.
[07:06.78]Okay, now I'm going to make the chat so I can see it.
[07:12.92]Good lord!
[07:15.36]Well, that was not cool.
[07:16.70]Let's get a server with zero people in it.
[07:21.54]And my TF2 server is coming along.
[07:24.66]I know I said last week it was going to be done this week, but it's not.
[07:28.94]It's close, though.
[07:32.06]I have to talk to the guys at gameservers.com.
[07:36.18]We have to have a meeting.
[07:38.88]Some type of meeting.
[07:42.02]What's up, dudes?
[07:44.44]If you're just joining us, I, uh... I just spilled a cup of milk on my floor.
[07:49.92]And it's gonna stay there until I'm done screaming.
[07:51.90]I hope I don't, like, ruin anything.
[07:54.91]If it, like, seeps over near my computer, that's gonna be really bad.
[07:58.63]That might have to be, like, an emergency stop.
[08:00.35]Alright, let's go to...
[08:05.72]No, no Toot Fort, no Dust Bowl.
[08:08.62]We play Dust Bowl too much.
[08:12.15]How about... I'm going to Gravel Pit.
[08:23.43]I'm okay with Gravel Pit.
[08:24.75]Let's do Gravel Pit.
[08:25.77]This is the server.
[08:27.23]Ladies and gents, head there.
[08:30.79]Gravel Pit.
[08:36.40]Yeah, Dust Bowl is a little overplayed, but I love it, though.
[08:39.72]I love Dust Bowl.
[08:41.44]And I mean, that's because I'm an old-school TF2 player.
[08:45.20]I mean, I've been playing since 2007.
[08:46.56]And I remember that.
[08:48.50]There used to only be Dust Bowl, 2Fort, Turbine, Gravel Pit.
[08:54.42]There was only six maps when TF2 launched.
[08:57.82]2Fort, Dust Bowl, Gravel Pit.
[09:07.73]Uhm... turbine. What were the other two maps?
[09:11.00]What the hell were the other two maps? Can somebody in the chat throw that out there?
[09:16.00]Oh, uh Well and I'm Granary, right? Those are the only- only six that came out release.
[09:25.00]Scope low go attacking tonight like being an attacker.
[09:33.00]Mhm... y'know we're gonna start with medic.
[09:36.52]I'm starting with the medic.
[09:40.38]Alright, let's get the audio good here.
[09:43.00]Game audio good?
[09:44.24]Voice audio?
[09:45.49]Is it- are we getting overpowered?
[09:46.13]You can never tell.
[09:52.65]Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[09:57.00]Oh yeah, aardvark baby!
[10:02.00]Alright, let's push this point boys.
[10:06.89]If anyone wants to duel me, I will accept it.
[10:09.75]I'm not going to promise I will win the duel to anyone watching the stream, but I will try my best.
[10:22.92]I got you, I got you, I got you.
[10:26.63]Follow me, doctor!
[10:27.71]We need this Uber, or what?
[10:28.97]Are we good?
[10:30.51]We're good to go?
[10:37.30]I don't know if I'm gonna get this.
[10:38.54]You know what?
[10:38.88]I'm gonna go not that way.
[10:43.38]I had to use it.
[10:45.68]I had to use it.
[10:47.66]Oh no.
[10:48.94]Oh no.
[10:51.20]Oh, I shouldn't have left.
[10:52.26]That wasn't my bad.
[10:53.03]I screwed that up.
[10:56.37]Oh boy.
[10:56.71]I'm gonna die.
[10:57.17]I'm gonna die.
[10:57.53]I'm gonna die.
[11:01.43]James A-hole.
[11:04.71]We're okay.
[11:06.15]That guy's going to try and shoot the window.
[11:07.97]We got it, we got it, we got it.
[11:09.43]Oh, give me that sandwich.
[11:11.09]Spy, where are you?
[11:12.99]You bastard.
[11:18.67]There you are.
[11:19.15]We got to get out of here.
[11:19.89]We're going to get destroyed.
[11:25.75]Thank you for saving my life.
[11:26.89]I don't want to say your name, Holland.
[11:31.92]Be very quiet.
[11:32.60]Be very quiet.
[11:34.46]What?
[11:34.86]What?
[11:35.34]What?
[11:39.30]I knew I got him!
[11:41.58]Alright, let's, uh, let's push it.
[11:46.37]I love your outfit, man.
[11:48.41]I think I said this before, last stream, but your outfit is unbelievable.
[11:52.89]And this is when we... I'm using it.
[11:58.76]I'm using it.
[11:59.92]You know, I'm gonna protect this guy, too.
[12:01.54]Just because.
[12:02.10]For fun.
[12:07.50]Attack!
[12:09.68]Oh, it's the guy I'm dueling!
[12:11.08]Oh, God!
[12:13.20]That's a spy!
[12:14.06]That's a spy!
[12:14.66]Oh, get away!
[12:16.50]Ah, damn it.
[12:18.23]I didn't even know that was the guy I was dueling.
[12:22.37]I just walked up and punched him in the face.
[12:26.67]Yeah, if you got a duel, throw it my way, dude.
[12:29.27]I will duel you.
[12:31.17]Abso-positive-a-lutely.
[12:37.13]We're gonna get A. Let's get A. Oh, I have to duel you.
[12:49.92]I don't even know if I... I don't think I have any duels.
[12:52.28]I think I gave them all away.
[12:54.86]Oh, shh.
[12:55.58]Here we go again.
[12:56.22]Give me that uber.
[13:05.66]We're going to be able to push this.
[13:07.44]Alright, crowbar.
[13:08.34]Let's see what you got, baby.
[13:14.93]No, no, no.
[13:16.41]Where are you?
[13:17.83]Oh, no.
[13:18.19]Get out of my way.
[13:21.77]Okay.
[13:22.57]Hi, guys.
[13:23.17]Hello.
[13:25.73]Get away.
[13:26.23]Damn it.
[13:32.38]Oh, damn it.
[13:36.43]Do you see, like, that whole group of people that were running up the stairs?
[13:39.39]That was terrifying.
[13:44.39]Good morning.
[13:45.39]Good morning.
[13:47.01]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[13:48.49]Good morning.
[13:49.49]Good morning.
[13:52.12]People need heals.
[13:53.02]I got you.
[13:53.68]I got you.
[13:55.68]Oh, Burger Boy.
[13:56.58]The dump machine.
[14:04.32]Oh, no.
[14:04.66]Oh, no.
[14:07.08]200 people to heal.
[14:07.90]I need the Quick-Fix.
[14:10.30]Oh my god, he's coming after me still.
[14:11.90]Oh my god, how did he get me?
[14:15.19]Dude, that guy was like in a bubble.
[14:18.65]He was in a bubble of invincibility right there.
[14:21.43]You know, I'm going Quick-Fix.
[14:22.33]Do I even have the Quick-Fix?
[14:24.97]After my backpack?
[14:26.23]Oh no, that's right, I unboxed a strange one.
[14:27.89]Forgot.
[14:28.65]I unboxed this.
[14:29.41]Might as well put it to use, right?
[14:36.33]Let's go, Scout.
[14:36.90]I want to be able to run fast.
[14:41.38]Run, run, run, run, run.
[14:43.48]Quick-Fix.
[14:47.68]Oh, yeah.
[14:48.18]Quick-Fix.
[14:53.19]Oh, you want to... Get him!
[14:57.69]No.
[14:58.09]No, don't kill the medic.
[14:59.51]Come here.
[14:59.95]Run to me.
[15:02.28]Oh, my God.
[15:02.86]Die, you bastard.
[15:06.12]Oh my god, dude.
[15:09.57]How many hits did that take?
[15:13.33]Alright, I got a new one.
[15:14.95]Let's push through this.
[15:18.09]Let's push through this nonsensical equation.
[15:22.57]Quick-Fix over.
[15:24.31]Oh, what you know about the Quick-Fix over?
[15:31.08]Come here.
[15:31.86]Come here.
[15:32.76]Oh, you jumped away from me.
[15:34.24]What the hell?
[15:36.45]Oh, we won.
[15:38.39]Cool.
[15:39.37]Nice job, guys.
[15:39.99]Good game.
[15:41.39]Good game.
[15:42.91]Jerma, do you like the Yogscast?
[15:44.85]I... I don't really watch it, to be honest.
[15:49.05]Yogscast is kind of like a Minecraft thing, isn't it?
[15:51.34]Or at least predominantly Minecraft, or... See, I have no idea.
[15:56.68]This is me just... I have absolutely no idea.
[16:00.78]They seem like nice guys.
[16:02.34]I mean, they seem like cool guys.
[16:07.10]You know, I don't... I'm changing.
[16:09.96]I want the Crit's Krieg.
[16:12.28]I want the Crit's Krieg.
[16:13.52]Can I get it charged before...?
[16:19.17]Well, I really... I don't have an opinion on him, to be honest.
[16:24.81]Oh, I can't high-five him.
[16:32.33]Let's go, Burger Boy!
[16:35.49]Optimus Prime just, like, standing there like a statue.
[16:39.81]Alright, Burger Boy, you better be ready to unleash hell on the world.
[16:51.79]After this, uh, critscreek, I'm gonna... Who's dying over here?
[16:55.59]Oh, you.
[16:56.41]Alright, Burger Boy.
[16:59.97]Watch out, Burger Boy.
[17:06.50]I'm holding on to this.
[17:07.80]I'll come back to you.
[17:10.06]Overheel fever.
[17:14.12]Oh, there is a spy here.
[17:16.67]Spy here.
[17:17.05]Spy.
[17:17.71]Put your thing down.
[17:25.25]Am I a fan of Shibby2142?
[17:27.49]I love Shibby2142.
[17:28.27]He's like a friend of mine.
[17:30.06]He's like a good bud of mine.
[17:32.48]You are.
[17:34.36]You are not real.
[17:37.05]Oh, he's still here.
[17:37.84]He's still alive.
[17:40.76]Me and Shibby2142 are broskies.
[17:42.50]I'm going to get to you.
[17:47.78]Just shoot a bunch over there.
[17:49.64]Oh, my God.
[17:51.14]Never mind.
[17:55.93]I do know Star as well.
[18:00.25]I'm not as close with Star as I am with Shibby, but I know Star.
[18:04.13]We talk.
[18:07.58]Speaking of Star, we may actually be doing videos together sometime soon.
[18:16.05]Sometime very, very soon.
[18:21.51]He's a cool guy, though.
[18:23.73]StimmyD?
[18:25.69]Yes, I know StimmyD.
[18:27.47]StimmyD is a bro.
[18:29.19]Pretty much, if you can name me a Team Fortress 2 channel, I'd probably know them.
[18:33.05]I'd probably know who they are, and I'd probably spoken to them.
[18:36.48]At least once or twice.
[18:41.02]Stay alive, derp.
[18:43.32]Do you know Jerma985?
[18:45.92]No, who's that?
[18:47.56]He sounds like a real loser.
[18:51.39]Oh, burger boy.
[18:54.41]Get rid of this guy.
[18:55.41]Get rid of this guy.
[19:00.75]Retreat.
[19:07.20]Bloody spy!
[19:08.08]Do you know?
[19:19.96]Is that a spy?
[19:20.64]Probably not.
[19:21.74]That's a spy!
[19:22.78]What?!
[19:24.50]Alright, so my brain just exploded.
[19:25.86]I walked towards that engineer, the real one, and then I turned around and I thought it was him again, and I thought it was real, so I got... Oh, that was a good spy.
[19:45.29]Why are we screaming?
[19:51.85]But to answer the question, yes, I know most of the Team Fortress 2 channels.
[19:57.53]I don't know all of them.
[19:59.19]I mean, there are probably a few that I've never really had a conversation with or something.
[20:03.47]But for the most part, I have had a conversation with all of them.
[20:07.65]I think there's soldiers in all of mine that jump on top of the tower.
[20:14.30]Alright, this is my... That's the spy.
[20:17.52]No, it's just the dump machine burger boy.
[20:20.24]No, stay alive, dude.
[20:21.18]I got you.
[20:22.21]Come here.
[20:25.11]Oh, the medic chain.
[20:28.15]Oh, my word.
[20:28.65]I'm getting in a little bit of trouble here.
[20:32.23]I shouldn't be walking out that far.
[20:36.38]Oh, just give me one more.
[20:37.46]And...
[20:43.29]Should I use it?
[20:44.15]Yes.
[20:45.85]Aw, everyone died.
[20:46.49]Why didn't I use it?
[20:51.53]Oh, crit rockets everywhere.
[20:57.66]Spiders?
[20:58.28]Oh, I hate spiders.
[21:00.34]They scare me.
[21:00.88]Alright, I'm going to go to... Do I even... I don't think I even have a Huntsman.
[21:07.02]No, I don't.
[21:07.86]My Huntsman's gone.
[21:09.56]Oh, forget it then.
[21:10.30]Wait, wait, wait.
[21:10.78]What the hell was that?
[21:12.50]What?
[21:13.50]What?
[21:14.98]Oh, hey, I'm just the floating sniper hand.
[21:16.70]There we go.
[21:17.34]That was weird.
[21:22.34]Let's go scalp.
[21:25.40]All defaults.
[21:28.93]Uh, no, I'm alright.
[21:30.19]Optimus Prime.
[21:30.75]I'm cool.
[21:32.11]Not right this second.
[21:32.83]Maybe after when it's all said and done.
[21:35.93]But for now, I want to focus on this stream.
[21:38.13]For now...
[21:42.45]Yeah, we'll do it in a minute, thanks.
[21:47.67]You know what I want?
[21:48.47]I want a strange Huntsman.
[21:52.93]Oh, crap.
[21:55.64]You are still alive.
[21:57.88]Is there even a strange Huntsman?
[21:59.44]Can you even get that?
[22:05.98]Ah, damn it.
[22:07.36]They have a strange... How much is a strange Huntsman?
[22:13.44]40 keys?
[22:15.67]It's 40 keys for a strange Huntsman?
[22:18.57]What?
[22:20.09]Oh my god!
[22:21.97]What crate do you get it in?
[22:25.81]What?
[22:26.21]Do you... Crate number 40?
[22:28.45]What?
[22:30.03]Wow, man.
[22:32.53]Wow.
[22:32.95]A salvaged crate.
[22:35.24]Oh, it's a salvaged crate?
[22:36.46]It's one of the rare ones?
[22:38.06]That's insane.
[22:38.74]40 keys.
[22:43.51]If I get a strange Huntsman, I know I'm gonna peep it.
[22:46.61]That's crazy.
[22:51.71]Anybody up here?
[22:52.71]I need help.
[22:55.91]Oh, what's up, Millennium Boy Exoskeleton Bug Body?
[22:58.53]I just landed on his head.
[23:06.60]Aww.
[23:07.98]I got blowed up.
[23:08.80]I got blowed it up.
[23:16.01]Oh, sorry, Millennium Man.
[23:18.37]Yeah, it's going to be fun.
[23:19.35]Well, after this round, we'll change servers.
[23:20.79]I don't want to use the pistol.
[23:24.39]Oh, I still have the critical.
[23:27.17]Let's put it on.
[23:33.20]Yeah, I love all the scatter guns, except for the Force of Nature.
[23:35.72]It's not my forte.
[23:38.12]I'm not a big fan of it.
[23:39.12]Let's see if we can't crit some people.
[23:45.44]Oh, my God.
[23:47.36]That was a death wish.
[23:48.14]I just wanted to see how many hit markers would just pop up.
[23:50.02]Well, I don't even think I have... Yeah, I don't have... I gave away my backpack.
[23:53.85]That's the only option I have right now.
[23:56.77]Where's my... What happened to my mad mill?
[23:59.71]Oh, right.
[24:00.77]I probably gave that away.
[24:01.83]Yeah, I gave that away as well.
[24:07.07]Well, well, well, well, well, well, well.
[24:12.52]Alright, let's close this out, boys.
[24:14.78]And girls, potentially.
[24:17.99]I want to get a good couple kills with this thing-a-jig.
[24:24.81]No, that's a death wish.
[24:26.03]I'll go the other way.
[24:28.47]I shall go the other way.
[24:29.65]Anybody over here?
[24:35.18]Not that I can see.
[24:36.20]Anyone going to come out this way?
[24:41.35]Oh, God!
[24:41.73]I didn't think that guy... I didn't even see him.
[24:44.25]Run away!
[24:44.77]Oh, my God.
[24:51.61]See, getting stuck just, like, saved my life right there.
[24:53.89]I want to get shot right in the back.
[24:58.87]I want to get shot right in my behind.
[25:05.91]Ah, crap!
[25:13.09]I'm bumping into somebody.
[25:14.67]Bumping into somebody.
[25:16.83]Yep, there he is.
[25:19.57]Help me!
[25:24.03]Wow, the Dead Ringer.
[25:30.19]Anybody, anybody?
[25:34.39]Oh, nine damage.
[25:36.83]Thank God I did 90.
[25:41.99]Oh, man.
[25:42.39]This is bad news.
[25:43.17]Bad news right here.
[25:43.97]What am I thinking?
[25:49.00]Oh, God.
[25:49.86]I tied it up at the very end.
[25:51.92]Oh, my God.
[25:53.88]Right at the very end, I tied it.
[25:55.54]Holy crap.
[25:56.90]Alright.
[25:57.22]Good game, guys.
[25:58.58]We are going to change servers now.
[26:00.98]So, thanks, guys, jumping on this one.
[26:03.14]Let's go on a new one.
[26:08.22]This... I gotta clean this milk up.
[26:13.78]I gotta clean this Mad Milk up.
[26:25.10]Viaduct?
[26:26.46]No, that's... I don't know where that is.
[26:28.06]Five Gorge could be cool.
[26:29.84]What else we got?
[26:32.28]Granary?
[26:33.65]I might be feeling Granary right now.
[26:36.84]I think I'm feeling granary, guys.
[26:40.61]Sawmill of granary.
[26:43.11]Alright.
[26:44.09]Sawmill of granary.
[26:50.21]Granary it is.
[26:51.03]We're doing granary.
[26:55.53]In the Reddit server, apparently.
[26:58.55]Copy that.
[26:59.11]Here you go.
[27:02.86]There's the new server.
[27:10.48]Granary is one of those maps that you never feel like playing on it, but once you're actually playing on it, you have a good time.
[27:16.98]I don't know why.
[27:18.14]Every single time I play Granary, it's like, oh, do I want to play Granary?
[27:22.29]I don't think so.
[27:23.65]But then when I actually get on it, it's like, oh, this is fun.
[27:32.05]Oh, it just changed a well.
[27:34.27]Well, that's cool.
[27:37.09]I feel the same way about well, though, to be honest.
[27:43.68]Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[27:48.50]Here we go.
[27:50.22]Here we go.
[27:51.94]I'll go red because I was on blue last time.
[27:56.06]Maybe not.
[27:58.34]And maybe so.
[27:58.94]Nope.
[28:01.08]Let me join red.
[28:03.90]This time we're going to play demo.
[28:07.36]Default Demoman.
[28:09.43]Okay.
[28:09.87]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[28:11.31]Strange.
[28:12.29]Lock and load.
[28:14.47]I almost forgot.
[28:17.13]I almost forgot.
[28:20.53]Mission begins in 30 seconds.
[28:22.42]Mission begins in one second.
[28:24.38]One.
[28:25.02]Go!
[28:25.48]What's up with my pain, son?
[28:28.24]I don't know, Millennium Man, get a better internet.
[28:33.14]I don't know, let's see, can I kill somebody?
[28:38.55]Come on, where are you at?
[28:40.59]Mission begins in 10 seconds.
[28:47.64]Oh, man.
[28:57.71]Millennium Man.
[29:02.17]Will I be selling admin on my server?
[29:06.02]No.
[29:07.60]I plan on just having people be able to play.
[29:10.26]And I'm sure that, you know, if you play there for long enough and you're, you know, a good supporter of the server, I would just give it to you.
[29:17.09]You wouldn't have to pay for it.
[29:21.45]Save your money.
[29:24.64]That was a bad jump.
[29:26.18]And now I'm gonna die, like, instantly.
[29:27.96]Well, no, no, I'll be okay.
[29:34.02]Where is everybody?
[29:35.88]Where is everybody?! !
[29:45.49]Nothing in there.
[29:46.33]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[29:47.57]He's behind us.
[29:51.33]He's dead now.
[29:52.39]What is... Wow.
[29:58.57]Oh, I thought he was going to walk out the door.
[30:02.89]It's alright.
[30:03.29]Get me out of here.
[30:06.27]Oh, no.
[30:07.11]Oh, no.
[30:07.45]What's going on?
[30:09.41]No, I'm going to drown.
[30:11.76]Oh, my God.
[30:14.69]I really thought I was going to drown right there, guys.
[30:28.34]Oh, come on.
[30:30.18]Get in here.
[30:35.02]Oh, die.
[30:36.78]There we go.
[30:37.56]Watch out behind us.
[30:38.23]Behind us.
[30:38.83]Yikes.
[30:41.99]Dun dun dun dun dun.
[30:51.09]I got wrecked right when I got over here.
[30:56.60]Oh my god, I didn't expect this.
[31:02.88]Oh, dang, I didn't even look.
[31:03.94]I should have been looking.
[31:04.64]I'm an idiot.
[31:05.56]It's my bad.
[31:06.12]It's up top, isn't it?
[31:10.16]Yep, it is.
[31:11.54]Nice job, guys.
[31:15.83]Nice job, gentlemen and ladies.
[31:22.83]Good job, gentle ladies and gentlemen.
[31:25.99]Ah, who's that?
[31:26.69]Who is that?
[31:27.47]Who am I doing an impression of?
[31:32.35]Oh, jump!
[31:38.65]Mission begins in 30 seconds.
[31:40.83]We're going across the top.
[31:47.48]Oh my god, look who it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[31:50.41]Burger Boy, with like a chocolate melted in his mouth.
[31:53.27]Oh, what am I doing?
[31:54.99]I shouldn't have came this way.
[31:56.41]Why is that up here?
[31:57.77]Why is that up here?
[31:59.89]Who got up here?
[32:02.69]What?
[32:03.15]How?
[32:03.35]That must have been from the last round.
[32:11.15]Come here.
[32:14.01]Oh, I'm never gonna hit him.
[32:19.14]He just, like, jumped into that.
[32:21.48]Where's my spray?
[32:22.60]I want a spray.
[32:27.04]Oh, come on.
[32:27.44]Walk all over this.
[32:28.12]Come on.
[32:29.94]Come on.
[32:34.74]Oh, let me get it up there.
[32:39.46]Aw.
[32:41.02]Well, at least we got it.
[32:44.53]Thanks, Pally.
[32:48.25]Go this way, go this way, go this way.
[32:53.01]Careful for spies.
[32:54.17]That might be a spy.
[32:55.21]I think it was.
[32:55.67]Yes, it was.
[32:58.43]Cartoons.
[33:00.06]C-c-c-c-c-cartoons.
[33:01.38]Cartoons.
[33:04.40]Be careful.
[33:04.84]We're entering the enemy base.
[33:07.50]Oh, man.
[33:08.14]We might be like a team scramble.
[33:15.11]Uh...
[33:22.29]Oh, boy.
[33:29.07]Oh, get out of town!
[33:33.75]No!
[33:34.56]Dammit!
[33:39.58]I thought if I would just be in tryhard mode right there, I could just be quiet and kill him.
[33:51.39]The teams, I guess, aren't that bad.
[33:56.58]We could probably use a scramble.
[33:57.68]Maybe not.
[33:58.66]We'll find out.
[34:06.42]Going this way, going this way.
[34:07.54]There's a dude right here.
[34:16.31]Oh boy.
[34:17.39]Heads up.
[34:18.05]Heavy.
[34:20.33]Really not anymore.
[34:23.93]Oh, I thought I was going to hit him.
[34:26.89]It's all about that little area, little corridor.
[34:29.15]Oh, I thought it would hit.
[34:35.58]Oh, he didn't get hit by that?
[34:36.54]What is up with that?
[34:42.74]How can we... Oh, we're defending this point.
[34:44.34]Right, right, right.
[34:46.41]Oh my god, did I get like four in here?
[34:49.61]I'm gonna die!
[34:50.46]I'm gonna die!
[34:50.98]Help me!
[34:52.66]Somebody help me!
[34:54.10]Oh, suicide.
[34:54.78]I'm gonna die.
[34:57.96]Damn.
[35:01.44]The heavy baby.
[35:04.44]Actually, I talked to DJ last night about it.
[35:09.77]And he's working on more stuff.
[35:11.95]He's a hard worker, man.
[35:13.07]He's got a lot of cool ideas.
[35:14.63]He's working on a lot of stuff.
[35:16.61]So...
[35:17.78]It's coming.
[35:18.70]It's coming.
[35:21.77]Oh, you just scared me.
[35:23.65]Thought you were an enemy.
[35:26.65]Oh, wow.
[35:30.97]Oh, no!
[35:32.43]Why did I do that?
[35:34.87]I got behind everybody and no one knew I was there.
[35:37.51]What is wrong with me?
[35:42.28]What is the matter with me?
[35:45.98]If I had just, like, not been a freak show, I probably would have had a couple of kills right there.
[35:57.83]Woo-hoo!
[35:58.97]I made it.
[36:08.07]Whoa.
[36:10.59]Oh, come on.
[36:11.45]Come on.
[36:12.33]Alright.
[36:14.16]We're going viral.
[36:16.51]Pyro with the flare gun and I don't... I do have a Degreaser still.
[36:20.27]I have a Degreaser.
[36:23.82]You gotta use the console to enter the server IP.
[36:28.96]I think it's the tilde key.
[36:30.04]You have to enable it.
[36:33.60]Hold on a second.
[36:35.50]I've got to appear offline.
[36:42.14]Just so those notifications stop popping up.
[36:44.81]Because nobody wants to see the notifications.
[36:49.25]They want to see Team Fortress 2.
[36:50.61]Oh, damn it.
[37:00.47]This is going to be tough.
[37:04.39]Oh, God.
[37:04.53]So much stuff going on.
[37:06.97]No, no, don't die.
[37:08.27]I was trying to save the heavy.
[37:09.41]What?
[37:09.93]Who got hit by the bus?
[37:13.01]Somebody got hit by the bus, I think.
[37:18.35]Yeah, this is the tilde key, if you want to know how to enable it.
[37:21.93]Go to options, go to advanced, and then enable developer console.
[37:27.09]You want that checked.
[37:28.77]And then once that is checked, by default, it is the tilde key, the thing under escape.
[37:33.46]And it looks like this.
[37:35.42]Then you type in connect, space, then the IP, and then enter.
[37:40.78]And that's it.
[37:42.58]And that's all she wrote.
[37:46.57]Massive bus accident.
[37:47.87]Got hit by a train.
[37:49.49]Oh my god.
[37:50.09]This way.
[37:55.78]Aww.
[37:58.36]No.
[38:00.56]Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.
[38:10.76]I'm gonna spell it out.
[38:11.79]D-A-M-N-I-T-E.
[38:16.26]I have never played TF2Ware.
[38:18.20]I've heard it is hysterical though and I am absolutely willing to try it.
[38:24.64]They're pushing us back.
[38:26.10]They have pushed us all the way back.
[38:28.69]This is not good.
[38:29.95]I'm hanging out here.
[38:35.33]TF2Ware is like a WarioWare mod for Team Fortress where you get like five seconds to do like a little mini game.
[38:42.08]It's very funny.
[38:42.68]I've seen videos on it.
[38:43.70]It looks really entertaining.
[38:51.86]Watch out for them.
[38:52.58]Whoa!
[38:57.80]Oh, dammit!
[38:59.43]Oh god, it's chaos!
[39:01.31]Shoot at me!
[39:02.27]Somebody shoot at me with something!
[39:09.55]Duh, that was just chaos.
[39:12.83]Gotta move that gear up.
[39:15.90]Yeah, actually, I own Garry's Mod.
[39:19.40]I'm not very good at it, though.
[39:20.40]I know a lot of people in Garry's Mod can make ridiculous things.
[39:24.68]I'm not one of those people.
[39:28.04]Like, oh, I made this boat that's actually a car, that's actually a house, and it moves, and these mouths are animated.
[39:34.72]I can't do anything like that.
[39:38.32]I wish I could.
[39:38.92]God.
[39:42.48]Oh, my God.
[39:45.28]Oh, my God.
[39:46.15]Retreat.
[39:48.47]Wow.
[39:49.34]No!
[39:50.05]No, no.
[39:52.47]Oh, there's nothing I can do about that.
[39:55.09]Damn it!
[39:57.29]New server, guys.
[39:58.89]We'll do one more new server, and then we're going to hop over to Binding of Isaac, probably.
[40:05.84]Last empty server.
[40:06.86]Where are we going to find you?
[40:10.96]Auxiliary Operation.
[40:12.18]What the hell is that?
[40:13.00]1 out of 32.
[40:14.86]Actually, this one's 1 out of 28.
[40:18.70]Badwater.
[40:19.50]We can end it on Badwater.
[40:22.38]There you go.
[40:23.86]Join that server right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:27.04]That's the new IP.
[40:32.27]I'll post it again.
[40:33.91]And there it is again.
[40:38.73]Oh, man.
[40:46.40]I'll go defense again.
[40:48.12]Gonna go big sentry engineer.
[40:50.42]Oh man, this is depressing.
[40:51.97]Where's all my stuff?
[40:55.53]This is all I have.
[40:58.73]Where's all my, like, hats?
[41:01.77]At least I have this.
[41:05.33]I can look like, oh, I can put this on.
[41:07.79]Wait, I can wear this?
[41:09.46]Oh, cool, I didn't know I could wear that.
[41:10.90]That's awesome.
[41:12.50]Hell yeah, I'll wear that.
[41:14.02]I'll wear my ring.
[41:21.24]Alright, let's do it.
[41:30.32]Big sentry engineer.
[41:34.62]Get that built.
[41:35.38]Let's get it to, you know what, just do an entrance.
[41:43.29]I'm good.
[41:44.03]I'd rather have like the return to glory.
[41:57.18]But thank you, though, Prime.
[41:58.70]Appreciate that.
[42:01.14]Where's it going?
[42:01.70]Let's go right here.
[42:03.94]This is a pretty safe place, usually.
[42:07.29]Get out of my way.
[42:10.95]No, you know what?
[42:11.37]This is going over here.
[42:17.41]That's going over here.
[42:18.25]We're going.
[42:19.33]We're going.
[42:22.46]Oh, yeah, we're on fire.
[42:24.22]Fire, fire, fire.
[42:26.76]Hey, knuckleheads, I'm talking to you.
[42:28.22]Bonk.
[42:28.87]Oh, what?
[42:42.35]Okay, that just scared the crap out of me.
[42:46.25]That just scared me.
[42:48.33]Like, I really got scared by that.
[42:50.81]Like, it was like...
[42:54.27]Oh, man, I'm sorry, you guys.
[42:56.57]If you were in that server and you just got in and you... I really am sorry.
[43:04.52]Okay, well, let's do this again.
[43:08.42]This one is... No, I don't want to go there.
[43:11.58]Twelve people in it already.
[43:14.42]Damn, that was... That was dumb.
[43:21.55]Alright.
[43:25.88]Dust Bowl.
[43:26.70]No, this one's bad.
[43:27.52]There's bots here.
[43:29.70]So if we start to join this, it'll get rid of the bots, right?
[43:32.92]That's usually what happens.
[43:37.53]I'm pretty sure that's what happens, so let's try this one.
[43:43.15]Bad water basin.
[43:45.93]Hopefully this one doesn't just turn off.
[43:47.89]Insta-turn off.
[43:51.36]I hope you're enjoying your time, because it's about to insta-turn off.
[43:58.61]Alright, I'll stick with this.
[44:00.83]I'll stick with this.
[44:01.42]I'm going over here, though.
[44:03.38]Oh, you're already over there.
[44:05.54]Alright, you got that covered.
[44:06.80]I'm cool.
[44:07.26]I'll stick with it right there.
[44:13.80]Jeremy, why is Burger Boy so fat?
[44:15.76]Hey, that's not nice.
[44:17.08]That's not a nice thing to say about Burger Boy.
[44:19.26]I'll just get the thing again.
[44:31.01]This is a bad spot for that.
[44:32.05]I don't know why I put that there.
[44:33.18]Need to move that.
[44:35.50]Eventually.
[44:37.50]Somebody right there can just shoot at it.
[44:39.00]You know what?
[44:42.68]I might move my... I'm gonna move it.
[44:44.60]I'm going up here.
[44:47.27]I'm gonna go over here.
[44:48.29]Looks like they're not capping.
[44:52.95]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[44:55.33]Oh, damn it!
[44:56.11]Damn it, damn it!
[44:56.75]He doesn't have the sapper!
[44:57.51]He doesn't have sapper out!
[44:58.17]Somebody take care of that!
[45:02.07]You know what?
[45:03.35]I'm going to go Gunslinger.
[45:04.43]I have a feeling that's going to happen a thousand more times.
[45:13.76]Magic.
[45:14.34]I'm going to give my dispenser to this guy.
[45:17.16]I'm going to put it over here.
[45:20.18]In case somebody comes and uber charges and kills that, he'll have this backup one in case he needs it.
[45:28.75]There you go, sir.
[45:35.62]Let's go and get some more.
[45:37.04]Ah, I'll be okay.
[45:42.44]I'm going to leave.
[45:43.40]Whoops, didn't mean to click.
[45:51.03]Oh, what?
[45:54.09]What the hell?
[45:55.13]Run away.
[46:08.56]Two mini-sensors in the same spot.
[46:09.78]That's a double mini-sensor.
[46:13.70]Just a lot.
[46:15.90]Damn it.
[46:16.60]I got too many spies.
[46:18.74]Too many spies.
[46:21.64]Oh, Engineer.
[46:22.66]I'm not going to play with you.
[46:24.85]I'll go Soldier.
[46:26.93]Soldier with the Strange Liberty Launcher and the Italian's backup.
[46:31.15]Why not?
[46:33.17]Might as well.
[46:34.73]And the Strange has to touch it.
[46:37.30]Do I want a vintage Huntsman?
[46:38.61]I'm good.
[46:39.99]I'll be okay.
[46:40.79]Thank you, though.
[46:44.85]I'd rather, like I said before, I'd rather you guys keep your stuff.
[46:47.63]Because you could use it, too.
[46:51.74]What?
[46:52.30]Oh my god!
[46:54.44]This is fantastic.
[46:55.54]I'm dead instantly.
[46:57.82]Didn't even see that.
[47:03.11]Oh, they're gonna win!
[47:05.06]No, no, no, I want the shotgun.
[47:09.00]I just walked into that.
[47:14.43]If I would, I mean, any weapon of my choice, if I would have wanted, strange Huntsman everyone was just talking about, my god, it's worth like 50 million dollars or something.
[47:24.53]It's worth 500,000 million trillion dollars.
[47:26.27]Let's get on a streak here.
[47:31.75]What do you say?
[47:33.72]What do you say, Jerma?
[47:34.48]Let's get on a streak.
[47:42.32]A Reserve Shooter would have been a better option.
[47:47.95]Be careful.
[47:51.99]Careful here.
[47:54.13]Be careful.
[47:54.89]Oh boy, he's in trouble.
[47:57.35]Watch out, man.
[48:00.17]He's trying to fool us.
[48:05.30]Oh, this is a losing fight.
[48:06.18]This is a losing fight.
[48:08.84]Gotta get away.
[48:13.19]Oh, come on!
[48:15.61]Look at this health!
[48:16.79]Look at this health!
[48:23.09]Should you use your 3 Refined to craft a hat, or should you trade it?
[48:27.69]Um, it depends what hat you want.
[48:29.63]Because if you go into a trading server, you can, for a lot of
[48:34.30]A lot of the time, you can get one hat for one refine.
[48:37.41]Like, one of those craftable hats.
[48:38.61]It really depends on if you want just a hat.
[48:41.47]Because you could potentially get, like, three hats for three refine.
[48:45.11]Or, if you want to, like, just make a random one and potentially get one of the new ones.
[48:48.21]I got a new email, apparently.
[48:52.72]No idea what that is about.
[48:54.10]Gonna have to check that after I die.
[48:56.08]Whoa.
[48:59.94]He's going up here.
[49:05.27]Oh, that was lucky.
[49:11.37]Anybody in here?
[49:17.35]You're not a spy.
[49:22.96]Oh my god, there's a sentry.
[49:26.06]Shit.
[49:28.22]Dammit.
[49:30.22]Oh, they're gonna get it.
[49:30.86]They're gonna get it.
[49:34.24]Gotta get rid of that sentry.
[49:36.18]Even if I die, damn it, damn it, damn it.
[49:37.82]Oh, he's standing right there.
[49:39.16]Damn it.
[49:41.20]The difference between dirty and clean items, I really don't know.
[49:45.24]I'm not a real big trader.
[49:47.31]So I'm not really sure all the lingo.
[49:51.83]I think clean is when it doesn't say who crafted it.
[49:55.11]Isn't that what it means?
[49:57.62]Oh, uncraftable, okay.
[50:05.25]Wow.
[50:05.55]I think we're good.
[50:09.27]I think we got it.
[50:17.51]Oh, god.
[50:18.17]Oh, run.
[50:18.77]I don't have my equalizer.
[50:27.92]Oh, I'm in trouble.
[50:29.48]I need help.
[50:29.86]I'm bumping into a spy, too.
[50:38.36]Are they going to get it?
[50:39.02]Are they going to get it?
[50:39.76]I didn't even see what... I'm sorry.
[50:49.57]I'm looking back and forth at the chat in the game.
[50:51.71]What hat are you talking about?
[50:52.73]Do you want the hat, Jerma?
[50:54.16]I'm just reading.
[50:55.50]I'm like, wait, what hat?
[50:59.70]I would like it if... You guys don't have to give me anything.
[51:04.54]I got plenty of stuff.
[51:06.16]I got plenty of options where I can get things.
[51:08.08]You guys, hold on to your items.
[51:09.98]They're your hard-earned items.
[51:11.21]You guys deserve them, not me.
[51:14.75]There's a lot of people right there.
[51:17.67]I'm dead.
[51:17.97]Pick up the health.
[51:24.13]Oh, crit.
[51:25.79]Oh.
[51:28.66]Outside 100, I have a setup video.
[51:31.00]If you go to my YouTube channel and you type in 4,000 subs...
[51:34.86]I did, like, a 4,000 subscriber thing a long, long time ago.
[51:39.03]And it's a setup video.
[51:40.33]And it's got the same... I got the same computer, so... I'm probably going to get a new computer at some point in the near future.
[51:47.25]I would assume probably in the next couple months I will get a new computer.
[51:55.73]Well, that's over.
[52:00.19]You failed!
[52:01.15]You failed!
[52:04.49]Alright.
[52:06.07]So.
[52:07.63]I think I'm going to transition over to Binding of Isaac.
[52:11.60]For like one life or two lives or something like that.
[52:13.68]We'll see what I do.
[52:32.57]Binding of Isaac is a...
[52:34.55]Really weird, really disturbing kind of... It's made in Flash, I think.
[52:41.53]But it's a Steam game.
[52:42.64]You can get it for five bucks.
[52:44.38]It's very, very disturbing and very screwed up.
[52:47.10]So I will put that disclaimer out there before I stream it.
[52:54.33]But yeah, thank you guys.
[52:55.09]If you were just here for the TF2, then thank you so much for coming and watching.
[52:59.23]You guys rock and roll.
[53:01.73]And I'll catch you guys probably next time.
[53:03.35]Oh, I'm being hit in the face by a frying pan!
[53:07.30]Okay, that's enough.
[53:12.84]No one come over to where I'm at.
[53:14.26]I don't need to be taking damage.
[53:16.24]Let's do some Binding of Isaac.
[53:24.50]No, hold on to your hats.
[53:25.86]Hold on to your hats.
[53:26.72]Hold on to your seats.
[53:30.43]Let me see if I can stream this.
[53:36.36]Actually, I've got to change this on here, too.
[53:41.12]On the dash.
[53:42.06]The dashboard.
[53:49.44]Dashboard.
[53:53.32]Playing.
[53:53.76]Finding.
[53:56.42]Of Isaac.
[53:58.97]Update.
[54:05.55]Yeah, I gotta change my background.
[54:06.59]Actually, you know what?
[54:07.23]Let's change my background.
[54:11.29]Because this has been my background for a very long time.
[54:19.60]Let's change the background.
[54:21.38]Alright, so let's do... Personalize.
[54:29.42]Desktop backgrounds.
[54:31.20]Desktop background.
[54:33.25]Alright, so do I want...
[54:36.15]Like the Space Needle?
[54:38.13]Oh, God, I might be, like, breaking the stream.
[54:40.49]Maybe not.
[54:40.99]Let's see.
[54:42.31]Okay, I'm not.
[54:44.49]I think I like the Space Needle.
[54:49.11]Put up a photo of Grandpa.
[54:52.54]What about the ice one?
[54:55.26]Ooh, sleek.
[55:00.54]Oh, what about this one?
[55:02.08]Oh, man.
[55:02.70]Oh, this is the one.
[55:04.70]This is the one I'm keeping.
[55:06.18]Look at this thing.
[55:08.18]That thing is beautiful.
[55:09.86]Save changes.
[55:10.66]Look at this.
[55:14.08]Gorgeous.
[55:14.84]Gorgeous screen.
[55:16.82]It's like a painting.
[55:19.38]Alright.
[55:20.31]It's okay.
[55:24.85]So let's play Binding of Isaac.
[55:28.21]So, disclaimer.
[55:28.95]Disclaimer.
[55:30.20]Binding of Isaac is an incredibly messed up, disturbing, crazy, insane game.
[55:35.46]So viewer discretion is advised.
[55:38.16]I'm going to say that before playing because obviously this game is ridiculous.
[55:45.57]Hopefully the stream doesn't die.
[55:47.43]I don't think it will.
[55:53.41]Boom, boom, boom.
[55:54.27]Let's take a look.
[55:55.38]The audio is going to have to come down a little bit.
[56:00.09]It's okay.
[56:06.06]The Binding of Isaac.
[56:08.78]Isaac.
[56:09.40]Okay.
[56:12.78]Let's change this.
[56:19.52]Screen's gonna go black.
[56:20.75]Black screen.
[56:26.01]Let's screen region.
[56:27.15]Take this.
[56:31.23]And stretch it out.
[56:32.23]Alrighty.
[56:35.65]Binding of Isaac.
[56:44.83]So, I'm pretty good at this game.
[56:47.84]I've become pretty good at this game.
[56:51.86]I love this game.
[56:52.72]It is so much fun.
[56:54.18]It's just so addicting.
[56:55.02]We'll go with Cain.
[57:00.54]Kane!
[57:01.12]Got the eye patch.
[57:05.10]Alright, let's do it.
[57:08.87]The reason why I'm playing this again is because the DLC is coming out in the next couple of days, I think.
[57:16.17]The Binding of Isaac DLC should be out soon.
[57:25.29]I'll go get that bomb in the meantime.
[57:29.81]Gotta run around like a psycho.
[57:35.78]So if you like games that are... They call these roguelikes, don't they?
[57:39.88]Roguelike dungeon crawlers.
[57:46.87]TheRealBlizzard10121.
[57:48.39]How do you become a mod on the stream?
[57:52.19]Usually the mods are people that I'm friends with, that I talk to all the time and stuff like that.
[57:58.66]But, yeah, I mean, if you've been coming for that long, you know, I'll probably set up some type of way to get a mod.
[58:06.08]A way for you to get mod, or a way for people to get mod if they want it.
[58:09.02]But it's hard to give mods to people, because there's just so many people that would want it.
[58:14.08]So it's very, very difficult to say, oh, yeah, you can be a mod.
[58:17.20]Sure.
[58:18.30]Oh, triple shot.
[58:19.14]This is going to be a good game.
[58:20.50]This is going to be a good game.
[58:23.85]But it's hard to give out mod, specifically because it's just so many people want it.
[58:29.74]So if I were to give it to one person and somebody else would be like, I want mod too!
[58:34.00]And it's like... It's a very tough decision to make.
[58:39.54]But eventually I will probably do... I will probably do some type of way to get it.
[58:46.15]I don't know how, though.
[58:49.23]Triple shot is incredible.
[58:55.42]Did triple shock, extra damage, more tears.
[58:57.94]You're talking about just absolute chaos.
[59:00.26]Let me get that bomb and open up the secret room, for crying out loud.
[59:07.38]Spread gun.
[59:08.30]Oh, no.
[59:09.12]It was the troll bomb.
[59:10.30]That's not cool.
[59:13.62]Reply contest.
[59:14.97]Mod giveaway.
[59:15.83]You know what?
[59:16.65]That's what we'll do.
[59:19.05]I'll do some type of
[59:24.55]I don't know.
[59:25.15]I don't know.
[59:27.29]It's hard.
[59:29.05]I'll tell you one thing, for those of you that are hanging out here.
[59:31.61]I'm going to do... I'm going to make a video... I'm going to move this mouse.
[59:35.57]I'm going to do a video on this in the next couple of days.
[59:38.64]Next week's stream is going to be very, very interesting.
[59:43.42]Because I'm going to do a game show.
[59:46.24]I'm going to... Let me try and explain this.
[59:49.32]I'm going to buy...
[59:50.89]like another like 30 or 40 keys and get a bunch of crates.
[59:56.84]And what we're gonna do is we're gonna do like a trivia night where I have the screen open, it's on Team Fortress 2.
[60:04.28]And hold on, I'm gonna die.
[60:05.75]So the screen's open on Team Fortress 2, like 40 crates with 40 keys.
[60:09.91]And I'm going to ask trivia questions, like basically gaming trivia questions.
[60:14.08]It's not going to be all totally Team Fortress though, so it might be some other general gaming questions.
[60:19.80]And if you get it right, if you're the first person to get it in the chat, then you get to pick which crate you want to unlock.
[60:27.03]And I just thought about that the other day.
[60:28.69]I was like, you know, that would be actually really cool.
[60:30.57]It would be fun.
[60:33.23]So that's the plan for next week.
[60:35.11]And I'm gonna make a video on this.
[60:36.73]If you're watching this on YouTube and you're like, oh, wait, wait, wait, what?
[60:39.61]I want more details.
[60:41.03]There's gonna be a video made about that very, very soon.
[60:45.35]Alright, let's get some more hell wine.
[60:49.94]Yes, you will get what's inside.
[60:51.36]If you get the trivia question correct, you can open up whatever crate you want and you get whatever's in there.
[60:58.26]Doesn't matter if it's a five million dollar unusual or paint.
[61:01.44]You're gonna get it.
[61:06.90]Oh no, no no no, get out of my way.
[61:08.16]I don't want to die this early.
[61:17.23]Triple shot!
[61:23.47]Yeah, if you guys have crates, I mean, I know I did a crate.
[61:26.73]People donated a lot to the last one.
[61:29.91]But if you have crates, if you have, you know, series 20 and above.
[61:33.92]Anything lower than Series 20, I don't think I would want.
[61:38.06]We'll leave that alone for now.
[61:45.57]But yeah, it's just a way to involve everybody.
[61:47.31]Because I think that would just be fun.
[61:48.83]Like a trivia night, you know what I mean?
[61:50.15]Like, alright.
[61:51.39]In what level of, like, Legend of Zelda do you, like, just anything like that?
[61:57.32]Do you find the Master Sword?
[61:58.94]Just general, basic trivia questions.
[62:01.82]A lot of people would get involved.
[62:03.04]It would be really fun.
[62:06.37]And hopefully somebody gets something cool.
[62:09.35]Oh, sloth, what do you got?
[62:10.33]Nothing on me.
[62:14.49]You got nothing on me, my triple shot, baby.
[62:19.49]There would be a lot of Team Fortress questions, though.
[62:22.63]Like, oh, in what crate can you get a strange Jurati?
[62:28.13]Oh, I'm gonna die.
[62:29.45]I'm, like, too busy talking about what I'm doing.
[62:31.77]On my next stream, I'm, like, not even paying attention to this one.
[62:35.19]This is current.
[62:36.93]I have to use it.
[62:39.39]Oh, what am I doing?
[62:40.05]I didn't have to use that!
[62:41.05]I could have used it in a... Ah, whatever.
[62:43.49]Whatever, that's me being a really, really dumb, stupid person.
[62:46.85]But you know what?
[62:47.75]At least I can see everything.
[62:51.22]I'm seeking room.
[62:52.08]Secret room's right there.
[62:54.68]What I need is I need damage up.
[63:01.88]I know, I have a stealth, I know!
[63:03.26]I know, don't... I know.
[63:19.82]So, is the music too loud right now?
[63:21.74]I feel like it is.
[63:22.34]Or am I just freaking out for no reason?
[63:30.17]Oh, come on, hit him!
[63:33.11]Okay.
[63:36.95]You know, I have headphones on, so it's kind of tough for me to decipher how loud something is or not.
[63:45.86]And open up that secret room, baby.
[63:50.39]Three dollars.
[63:51.27]Or three pennies, not dollars.
[63:53.41]That's not a total waste of a secret room.
[63:59.19]How do you get the crates to me?
[64:01.26]I'll probably set up some type of way.
[64:04.72]Everybody doesn't have to give them, though.
[64:06.82]Because obviously I only need like 30 or 40 of them.
[64:18.83]I want to give you stuff.
[64:21.20]Should you get this game, I'm going to 100%, absolutely 100 million percent say yes, yes, yes a million times.
[64:29.85]This is an incredibly fun, incredibly addictive game.
[64:32.19]It's just...
[64:34.04]like a like 17 and up like this is this game is not designed for like younger people to play only because of the incredibly like blasphemous and ridiculous imagery that is associated with it but if you don't care about that then this game is one of the most fun addictive probably one of the best games I've ever played that's under ten dollars this game's only five bucks this game is five dollars on Steam like yikes that's insane
[65:07.78]This was actually supposed to be ported to the 3DS, but Nintendo said, ah, ah, ah, that's not happening.
[65:15.90]Aw, I don't want the kamikaze thing.
[65:23.34]Do I even have enough money for anything?
[65:24.60]I don't think so.
[65:25.16]It's not even worth opening this door.
[65:26.44]It's not even worth opening the door.
[65:29.42]I don't even have enough money to get anything in there.
[65:35.64]Die!
[65:39.36]Come on, hit him.
[65:41.14]I got the triple shot, why am I missing so much?
[65:43.98]Yeah, Nintendo said because of religious and blasphemous and just... The game is just really... very, very dark.
[65:53.86]So it is only on Steam.
[65:55.98]It's the only place you can get it.
[65:59.10]I don't think it's on Xbox Live.
[66:00.38]Oh, look, a Sun card.
[66:01.28]Might as well, like, waste it.
[66:04.32]I'll come back to the judgment.
[66:07.32]Uh, let's whoop this boss's butt.
[66:11.14]Give an eye!
[66:14.50]I'm, like, tempted to just use the sun card and not have to even fight this guy.
[66:18.16]But you know what?
[66:19.04]I'm not gonna do that.
[66:20.98]We will do this the right way.
[66:24.90]I'm trying to get rid of the baby first.
[66:30.21]I don't think I can, though.
[66:31.87]Pretty sure you can't.
[66:34.27]Yeah, you can.
[66:39.04]I need more tears.
[66:41.24]Not shooting fast enough.
[66:44.80]Something from the future I unlocked.
[66:46.52]Because I'm now in the basement.
[66:49.56]Speed up.
[66:55.79]I would use the sun card, but... Honestly, it's just, it's a... It's a, oh, crap moment.
[67:03.97]Like, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, use it!
[67:08.34]Come on, show yourself.
[67:09.04]Bang.
[67:10.12]I will take whatever is in there.
[67:12.80]Take that key.
[67:13.68]Thank you very much.
[67:19.27]How do you play this game?
[67:20.69]It's just with the keyboard.
[67:22.65]And you just go from room to room, clearing out all the monsters, just like Legend of Zelda or StarTropics, or other games that are around the same design philosophy.
[67:32.71]Once you kill every single thing in the room, as you see in the top left of the map, you can see what rooms are open that you can go to.
[67:38.36]You fight the boss, you kill the boss, you go on to the next level.
[67:42.24]And if you die, it's over.
[67:44.86]You cannot continue.
[67:46.85]There is no lives, there is no continuing, you just die.
[67:50.29]And you have to start all over again.
[67:53.13]This is gonna be a room where I might have to be... If I just take this nice and slow, I'll be okay.
[67:59.54]I might not need to use the sun card.
[68:03.04]Gotta get rid of these guys.
[68:04.16]There we go.
[68:06.26]There we go.
[68:06.78]Get outta here, you big fat red bastard.
[68:14.91]Ugh!
[68:16.67]Question is, I'm gonna do it.
[68:20.15]I'm gonna do it.
[68:22.27]Get the coin and the bomb back.
[68:24.82]Ha ha!
[68:28.80]Mmm... I'll take that.
[68:31.56]Yeah!
[68:32.73]Money, money!
[68:34.61]Lots of money!
[68:37.47]Now if I see an item room, I will open the door.
[68:42.86]Because it will be actually worth it.
[68:45.86]Pills!
[68:46.38]Kayn is the best with pills.
[68:47.78]Take them.
[68:51.90]God damn it.
[68:54.66]If I had only known that.
[68:55.72]If I had only known that.
[69:00.50]Blast damage increased.
[69:03.05]Oh, I hate this item because it freaks me out.
[69:05.19]Look at my guy.
[69:07.38]That looks really screwed up.
[69:15.78]Should I go in the mob room?
[69:17.77]I'll do it.
[69:18.15]Why not?
[69:20.05]Oh, and more pills.
[69:22.43]Who knows what they are?
[69:23.11]I'm not going to use them yet, though.
[69:26.23]Man, I'm shooting way too slow.
[69:29.93]This is, like, messing with me.
[69:31.23]I need faster speed.
[69:33.51]Firing speed.
[69:38.63]Darn.
[69:41.82]These guys make a really weird noise.
[69:46.16]Oh, if I could just kill them faster!
[69:47.62]Come on, die.
[69:52.32]Oh, come on.
[69:54.12]They don't shoot fast enough.
[69:56.30]There we go.
[69:57.44]Oh, come on!
[70:00.14]You freaking bastards!
[70:06.02]Oh my god.
[70:10.24]Oh my god!
[70:13.56]Oh my god!
[70:20.98]There we go.
[70:22.50]Let's see what this is.
[70:25.11]Oh no!
[70:30.25]Well, that was... dumb.
[70:33.04]Still got one more place and I have the secret room, probably right here, maybe?
[70:36.48]Either right here or down... No, it's gotta be down here.
[70:40.44]Secret room!
[70:42.30]Thank you very much!
[70:43.20]Eggs!
[70:43.60]Uh, I will take these eggs.
[70:53.91]Alright.
[70:58.23]Easy as pie, these guys are nothing!
[71:03.78]The Hanged Man.
[71:05.16]Oh, this one's kind of... I don't really need that right now.
[71:09.82]But I will blow up this machine, for sure.
[71:12.00]And I'm gonna... Can I do it with the Kamikaze?
[71:16.11]I don't even know if I can.
[71:17.37]I'm not even gonna pretend to know.
[71:22.45]The Emperor!
[71:23.15]What does the Emperor do?
[71:24.99]I forget what... MLC Stealth!
[71:26.43]What does the Emperor do?
[71:28.39]What do I... How do I... What do I do?
[71:30.31]What does this one do?
[71:30.87]I forget.
[71:33.92]And Elsie Stell... Takes you to the boss.
[71:37.28]Okay, I'm absolutely not going to do that.
[71:41.33]I will pick this back up.
[71:42.47]The sun card.
[71:51.27]Don't even... No, I'm going to try and hit it.
[71:55.09]Sticking with the sun card.
[71:59.88]Oh my... I'm using it.
[72:03.07]That was just... I thought it had bad news written all over it.
[72:06.65]Okay.
[72:09.43]Ten bombs.
[72:11.53]You know, I'm doing it.
[72:12.63]I'm absolutely doing it.
[72:13.49]And I'll get the key, too.
[72:15.01]And I'll get the heart.
[72:16.30]I'll get it all.
[72:16.94]I'll buy your whole damn store up.
[72:24.32]Take the hangman.
[72:26.42]Actually, what?
[72:27.40]No, I don't want the emperor card.
[72:29.46]Well, you know what?
[72:29.88]I will take the emperor card.
[72:31.60]You know why?
[72:33.44]Because there's no more other rooms to go in.
[72:34.94]Let's go!
[72:35.38]Woohoo!
[72:38.52]Versus a fish shooter.
[72:43.21]You don't blow up.
[72:44.91]I'm going to use these bombs on him.
[72:48.05]Actually, no, that's not a good idea.
[72:51.48]I'm going to be in a lot of trouble because I'm shooting way too slow.
[72:54.16]This is way too slow of a shot.
[73:07.25]At least I did that, okay.
[73:08.55]Now get out of my way.
[73:16.21]No, I just saw what you said, Blizzard.
[73:20.84]I just don't want to die, so I'll address it in a second.
[73:29.14]Get out of my face.
[73:30.70]Okay.
[73:31.30]Jerma, would you like any Steam games like God of War or maybe Serious Game 3?
[73:34.36]Um...
[73:38.13]I, uh, I do, I don't, I have, oh!
[73:40.07]Tears up, tears up, tears up!
[73:41.87]Yes, awesome.
[73:42.95]That's exactly what I needed.
[73:45.12]Uh, I don't have Gotham City Impostors, but I, I own Sirius Sam 3, so you, you don't need to give me that.
[73:53.92]I do not have Gotham City Impostors.
[73:55.48]I keep hearing it's fun, though.
[74:00.15]Can you pronounce my name?
[74:02.27]XXXLatha1XXX.
[74:06.57]And I even came close.
[74:09.85]Oh, come on, get out of my face.
[74:19.08]Alright, at least I got faster tears.
[74:22.58]This is way better.
[74:25.82]My keyboard's getting stuck.
[74:28.04]My keyboard, stop getting stuck!
[74:32.74]Yeah, but I've heard nothing but good things about Gotham City Impostors.
[74:35.15]I heard when it launched it had a lot of problems.
[74:37.59]And I think it still has connection problems.
[74:39.53]Correct me if I'm wrong, but... I remember people talking about that, being like, I can't even play the game!
[74:43.92]Open sesame!
[74:55.36]Alright, let me read the chat.
[74:57.83]Will you be doing playthrough Borderlands 2?
[75:00.49]I will probably.
[75:01.27]I mean, that game's not coming out for a very long time, though.
[75:04.11]I think September, right?
[75:05.81]So, I'm not sure exactly who I'll play it with.
[75:08.73]I have no idea.
[75:11.09]But yes, I'm assuming I will play it.
[75:18.89]Where's the DLC for this game?
[75:20.68]Talking about new releases, when are we gonna get the... Lamb, the Wrath of the Lamb, whatever it's called, the DLC.
[75:28.38]Oh my god.
[75:29.34]You know what, eat bomb.
[75:31.72]Eat bomb!
[75:38.67]I used the kamikaze and it killed me!
[75:43.41]I hit the spacebar and it... Oh my god!
[75:50.23]Dude, I accidentally hit the space bar and it killed me.
[75:54.99]I can't believe I had this stupid item.
[75:57.37]I cannot believe it.
[75:58.55]I can't.
[75:59.23]I am so mad right now.
[76:02.25]I could put my fist through the screen.
[76:05.14]Like, what?
[76:07.90]My finger happened to slip over the space bar and touch it.
[76:13.04]I can't believe it.
[76:15.04]I can't believe it.
[76:16.86]I can't believe it.
[76:18.11]I can't believe it.
[76:27.45]I went like this.
[76:28.11]Oh, oops, I hit space.
[76:29.83]Oh, god damn.
[76:31.49]That was a good run, too.
[76:33.05]I was doing fine.
[76:37.55]Alright, it's time for co-op.
[76:40.51]Come on.
[76:42.29]I am so upset right now.
[76:46.54]Freaking internet connection.
[76:51.14]And it's time for co-op.
[76:53.18]That's... That's just... I can't believe it.
[76:57.78]I'm sitting there doing... I'm running through Binding of Isaac without a problem.
[77:02.69]And I hit the space bar because I have the damn kamikaze.
[77:05.89]Oh, we're just gonna kill you!
[77:07.11]How did I even pick that item up?
[77:10.37]What a worthless item.
[77:12.97]Goddamn.
[77:18.29]Well, you know, whatever.
[77:22.67]It was bound to happen.
[77:24.87]It was absolutely bound to happen.
[77:27.03]That dat rage.
[77:29.63]Let's do a new window.
[77:31.03]Oh, God.
[77:34.54]Hold on.
[77:35.12]Whoops, hold on a second.
[77:36.54]Whoops-a-daisy.
[77:40.10]Add screen region.
[77:44.42]And here it is.
[77:46.14]Quop, quop, quop, quop.
[77:50.68]Quop!
[77:56.02]I'm still mad about that.
[77:57.16]I'm still, like, upset about that.
[77:58.62]Alright, we gotta have another co-op song.
[78:03.62]Let's see if I can get a co-op song.
[78:06.10]The only way I play this game is if I can do, like, a co-op song.
[78:09.87]So here we go.
[78:10.33]Ready?
[78:17.97]Playing QWOP!
[78:20.71]We gotta play!
[78:23.80]QWOP is the only game we play!
[78:26.50]When we play every day today!
[78:29.42]We gotta QWOP!
[78:32.18]We gotta crown the QWOP with a slop and a blop and a... That song sucked!
[78:38.33]That song sucks!
[78:39.55]Alright, we'll do another one.
[78:42.93]Okay, it's gonna start... It's gonna start like this, ready?
[78:52.77]Quarp is the only game you play when you wanna pray every single day to slug.
[79:00.62]You gotta slug.
[79:03.66]The only time you play, you gotta say, Quarp is the only game you play when you slug today.
[79:08.50]As a slug.
[79:11.20]As a slug.
[79:13.85]And I can't even, I can't even move.
[79:17.25]I can't even move today, but that's not the way we say today.
[79:20.89]We pray we got a new disguise.
[79:22.79]I can't even think.
[79:26.40]My mind is like all over the place right now.
[79:28.26]I'm like looking at this guy's legs and it's freaking me out.
[79:34.02]Alright, I gotta get past 15 meters.
[79:38.36]Den, den, den, den, den.
[79:40.20]Den, den, den, den, den.
[79:41.94]Slug, slug, slug, so slug.
[79:45.58]Alright, I got past 10.
[79:48.37]Gotta get past 15.
[79:50.49]Oh, yeah, baby.
[79:52.59]What do you know about that?
[79:55.89]Oh, my God.
[79:58.89]Oh, my God.
[80:00.03]Oh, my God.
[80:00.93]I just was doing it.
[80:04.28]I was doing it, guys.
[80:05.96]I was just doing it.
[80:08.00]Now we're doing it.
[80:08.62]Now we're doing it.
[80:09.18]Oh, I got it.
[80:11.96]I figured it out.
[80:12.82]I figured out co-op.
[80:13.68]I figured out how to play co-op.
[80:17.49]Oh, alright, last try.
[80:20.37]Last try, last try.
[80:21.77]Come on, I gotta get back into that.
[80:23.09]I had it.
[80:23.93]I was running.
[80:24.57]I was legitimately sprinting.
[80:26.77]Son of a bitch.
[80:30.83]Oh, hey, strange love.
[80:31.97]Strange love 23.
[80:32.69]Oh, come on, you slug bastard.
[80:40.59]Alright, if I get by 10, I'm good.
[80:46.20]Nope.
[80:47.26]Okay, whatever.
[80:49.56]Oh, that's gonna be it, guys.
[80:51.36]That's gonna be the end of the stream.
[80:53.76]Nobody dream.
[80:54.86]Dream of the dream stream.
[80:56.42]We gotta go.
[80:57.52]Go.
[80:58.18]That's the end of the stream.
[81:01.58]Thank you for coming to the stream.
[81:02.96]I hope you enjoyed the time with me on the stream.
[81:06.58]Now we gotta slug one more time to say goodbye.
[81:09.78]See you later, guys.
[81:15.18]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[81:20.57]That's it.
[81:22.73]Alright, ladies and germs.
[81:24.27]I'll see you guys later.
[81:26.25]Thanks for coming out.
[81:28.05]All over 200 of you guys still here.
[81:29.97]You guys are amazing.
[81:31.21]Thank you so much.
[81:33.05]Catch you guys later, guys.
[81:34.81]Peace and... Oh, I forgot to mention.
[81:37.29]Grandpa is going to be... It's going to be on Machinima Respawn in like 20 minutes.
[81:43.27]So if you want to see the new Grandpa trailer, it's pretty ridiculous.
[81:46.89]It's going to be there in like 25 minutes.
[81:48.73]So Machinima Respawn, 20 minutes.
[81:51.55]And yeah, thanks so much, guys.
[81:54.42]I'll see you all later.
[81:55.74]And take care, everybody.
