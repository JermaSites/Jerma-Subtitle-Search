[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.25]Hold on, have you guys been just sitting there spelling?
[00:05.36]I saw T-E, T-E, T-E, T-E, and I realized, oh, it's because half of you were saying T-E, half of you were saying L-A.
[00:15.02]Right, I see.
[00:17.52]Well, too many of you guys are doing T-E because that's all I saw.
[00:23.23]Yes.
[00:25.83]How are you?
[00:27.46]I'm not supposed to be here.
[00:28.31]I'll be right back.
[00:29.87]Two minutes have to go by before I say a word.
[00:31.35]Be right back.
[01:02.36]Two minutes, it's been 12.
[01:03.22]Yeah, I know.
[01:04.24]Okay, listen.
[01:09.26]You guys ever do the thing where you're in the shower and you say to yourself, I'm going to give myself 10 minutes, 8 minutes to take a shower.
[01:20.97]Okay, just get in there.
[01:22.41]I'm just going to wash my hair.
[01:23.55]I'm going to wash my body.
[01:25.01]I'm going to whistle for 30 seconds, you know, and just sit there in the hot water.
[01:30.70]you get to the part where you shampoo your hair and then every time limit you gave yourself never existed after the shampoo goes in it's almost like you can't count anymore it's like alright shampoo's going in I got like 60 seconds I can do this in 60 and then everything it goes blank and you just see it's like 15 minutes goes by and then you realize that you like glitch out as a human you're like wait no I was supposed to get out of here I was supposed to get the out of here
[02:00.10]Once I get the lather into the hair and I run my head underneath the hot water, it's like a reset button.
[02:10.82]I don't know what the, if the hot water gets involved in your brain or something, I don't understand.
[02:15.12]But I've run my head under the hot water and all of a sudden it's like, oh yeah, that's what I like.
[02:18.91]And now I, now I don't even know what, what was I doing?
[02:22.03]What was the plan today?
[02:26.99]So I, I stayed in there for an extra few minutes.
[02:35.73]Hot water melts his brain.
[02:37.01]I don't know.
[02:37.45]It's like, I don't know.
[02:38.11]Maybe it's like a little... I don't understand.
[02:40.61]Should I bring that up to the doctor?
[02:47.58]Yeah, hey, every time I get like hot water running over my head, I forget where I am.
[02:53.76]That doesn't happen.
[02:54.50]I'm kidding.
[02:54.92]You promised us eating on stream.
[02:59.01]Did you... You must have not have watched the stream from three days ago, four days ago.
[03:08.33]Jeremy, you promised us eating on stream.
[03:11.39]I did.
[03:12.75]I did it.
[03:13.13]I ate the Whopper, I ate the chicken sandwich, and I ate the salad.
[03:16.86]Which is the french fries.
[03:18.24]That counts as a salad.
[03:19.12]It's potato.
[03:19.56]It's vegetables.
[03:20.90]Hold on.
[03:21.12]I don't like where this mic is.
[03:21.98]Give me a second.
[03:49.23]Okay, that's better.
[03:49.79]Yeah, I didn't like the placement of the mic.
[03:54.37]It was making me very angry.
[03:58.63]Alright, so what we're gonna do today, we're gonna go back to Jedi Academy.
[04:03.81]Gonna finish it, have one more chapter left.
[04:07.16]And then we have to discuss how the next three or four weeks are gonna play out.
[04:12.18]Those of you that have been on this channel for the last year,
[04:16.27]or longer know that 2020 was supposed to have about two or three very major streams in it.
[04:25.97]I ran into some medical problems in 2020 and obviously the coronavirus fucked up everything, right?
[04:34.56]So a ton of those streams that were supposed to happen in 2020 have been moved into 2021.
[04:43.33]So the theory is over these, the baseball stream comes to mind.
[04:48.77]That's the number one big one.
[04:52.07]The theory is that in the first quarter here, we will do a couple of really big streams.
[05:01.50]The theory here.
[05:06.32]So over the next few weeks, because we're already into January and it's like, oh shit, it's already January.
[05:10.98]It's already almost middle of January.
[05:13.97]So I need to take some time to make sure that these big streams are going to be ready to go.
[05:20.90]We've got, I didn't forget.
[05:22.36]I said, people think I forget the 30 webcam stream.
[05:26.21]That's going to happen soon.
[05:28.99]The 30 webcam stream is not going to happen in like six months.
[05:31.57]That's going to happen like probably in the next like 45 days.
[05:39.36]So we're working on that.
[05:41.36]That's like the next one.
[05:42.34]That's the first one you'll probably see.
[05:44.60]Baseball stream is going to be after that.
[05:47.92]So we're going to really try to get that to happen.
[05:51.18]But it requires a little bit of time.
[05:55.19]So streams are going to be kind of sporadic here over the next three or four weeks.
[06:00.21]While a bunch of work is done on these various streams.
[06:08.05]Your 1080 is going to fry.
[06:09.65]That's another thing.
[06:11.09]Hey, thank you, not a plant, for bringing this up.
[06:16.32]The new computer is happening.
[06:18.02]Like, over these next three to five weeks.
[06:20.14]So, I'm getting a new computer.
[06:21.94]I'm going to upgrade this computer.
[06:23.36]There's a lot of... I'm stupid and I can't do anything.
[06:26.90]So, I need help.
[06:30.34]Good luck getting a GPU.
[06:32.29]Don't worry.
[06:33.43]I'll get one.
[06:39.96]We've been saying that shit for like the last four and a half months.
[06:43.02]I have to get one.
[06:48.12]So I'm going to be building a new streaming PC.
[06:52.33]I'm doing that.
[06:53.39]I've got some friends that I want to hang out with.
[06:58.95]I've got to go visit Etalyx.
[07:04.55]It's been like six months since I've last seen that guy.
[07:11.23]No, this is a lot going on and streams are going to be a little sporadic here over the next three or four weeks.
[07:21.26]So we will go from there.
[07:22.74]I will give you a good idea.
[07:27.67]He's your friend.
[07:32.73]Yes, he is.
[07:36.86]Pour milk into the GPU.
[07:38.46]Alright, we... Alright, thanks for the tip.
[07:40.82]I appreciate it.
[07:42.06]I don't have... It's not here yet, so... You're like... You're like three and a half weeks early with that one.
[07:49.60]The bird watching stream?
[07:50.60]That's another one.
[07:53.06]The plan is for me and my manager... Some of you know.
[07:57.88]The producer of a lot of these events that have happened.
[08:00.46]We're gonna just block out a shitload of stuff to do in the first two quarters of 2021.
[08:06.34]some of them are already done and they just need to be streamed but now is the time for that stuff to happen so all this long-winded thing is for me to tell you break Andy's taking another break
[08:30.95]No, I'm kidding.
[08:31.71]I'm kidding.
[08:33.23]I'm not taking another break.
[08:34.43]I'm kidding.
[08:35.53]But you'll probably see maybe like a couple streams a week.
[08:39.49]The next three or four weeks.
[08:42.19]I'm not taking another break.
[08:45.46]I'm kidding.
[08:46.06]I looked at the calendar of streams that I've done.
[08:49.44]And I'm like, oh, how many streams have I done over the last month or two?
[08:53.76]And it's like, oh, right.
[08:56.16]I took all the holidays off.
[08:59.11]That was like 10 days off.
[09:00.55]And then like, oh, time to go break Andy again.
[09:02.87]Like another 15, 20 days off.
[09:06.20]Oh, I mean, that's like... I mean, I can't do that.
[09:10.82]So, no, I'm not going to do that.
[09:13.10]You'll see a couple streams a week.
[09:15.10]Until we get a solid sort of foundation.
[09:18.95]On everything.
[09:20.59]But I am insanely excited for 2021.
[09:22.59]The baseball stream...
[09:27.21]is ready to go we just need a date and we need the venue to be ready that's it we've ever it's ready to go we were ready to go back in August but we had to stop it two weeks before the event was gonna happen we had to pull the plug on it because there was a huge spike in covid and we just couldn't we just were like we're not this is not something we can do right now
[09:54.94]It was back in that period where it was just a major, major spike in like every major city in America.
[10:01.70]So.
[10:03.52]Over these next three to five months.
[10:07.15]We'll see.
[10:07.67]We're hoping that we can get it done.
[10:11.19]How about right now?
[10:13.37]It's worse now.
[10:14.23]Well, we're not doing it now.
[10:16.71]Oh, shit.
[10:16.97]Oh, you can hear Star Wars.
[10:17.87]You're not supposed to hear Star Wars yet.
[10:21.87]We're not doing it like tomorrow.
[10:25.51]But to do a, to do a major stream like this in like April, we need to make sure that it's ready in January and February.
[10:34.44]You know, it's got to, we have to, you can't just like, you can't just like in April, like be like, Hey, it's time to go.
[10:39.40]Go let's do the stream.
[10:40.16]Everybody get.
[10:42.04]These things take time.
[10:46.23]Later today.
[10:50.23]When's the hacker stream?
[10:51.31]Well.
[10:59.43]That was going to happen.
[11:00.69]There was a little back and forth I had to do with Twitch to make sure that I could do that.
[11:10.94]There was a little back and forth.
[11:12.02]We're still kind of going to figure that out.
[11:16.96]God damn it.
[11:17.46]Stop pulling a truck into my driveway.
[11:22.01]When is the bathtub stream?
[11:33.02]Illegal streams are the best streams.
[11:34.68]Illegal streams are also... They're called illegal because then I get in trouble.
[11:39.21]And then... What do you want me to do?
[11:40.67]Do an illegal... Stop playing trumpets in my fucking garage!
[11:45.99]Stop doing that!
[11:47.13]Stop playing... Just leave me alone.
[11:54.81]There's the Catboy stream.
[11:55.78]That's another one.
[11:57.20]Look, there's going to be a shitload of streams in 2021.

[15:44.01]It's a crane.
[15:44.53]It's picking up.
[15:44.91]Is it going to drop it on his head?
[15:49.21]Alright, I'm going to drop this on his head.

[16:49.37]Alright, so dismemberment works now.
[16:51.01]Cool.
[16:53.03]What is it?
[16:53.71]This one.
[17:00.65]Did I?
[17:00.91]Oh, I just instantly killed that guy.
[17:03.57]There's a lot of reverse Jedi here.
[17:05.55]Wait, I have a question for you guys, Star Wars lore heads.
[17:12.71]If you have a red lightsaber, does that automatically mean you are a Sith?
[17:18.14]Can you have red lightsabers just because you like the color red?
[17:22.85]Yes, yes, yes.
[17:24.79]Okay.
[17:25.49]But what if you just like put like red Sith?
[17:28.93]What if you just have like Sith food coloring or something?
[17:32.13]Could you do that?
[17:33.42]If you had an orange lightsaber and you like just kind of added a red light into it or something.
[17:40.50]He's still bad.
[17:41.30]What if you just like the color red?
[17:48.52]I did not kill him in the air?
[17:49.58]Come on, that's bullshit.
[17:54.01]You're fucked up.
[17:54.89]Okay, so you're fucked up if you like the color red.
[18:01.41]What happened to me?
[18:11.96]Get over here, you fucker.
[18:15.38]I like the color red, therefore I'm evil.
[18:19.53]No, but hold on.
[18:20.27]We've got an all capitals lore master here.
[18:23.09]This is all capitals.
[18:25.43]They were very upset about this.
[18:26.71]No, but depending on which lore context it is, there is a certain process required to make your lightsaber crystal red, which only a Sith would do.
[18:34.37]So you probably wouldn't have a red lightsaber in that context.
[18:37.46]Otherwise, if it's just a normal crystal, then yeah, it's basically team colors.
[18:42.48]But red is only for the Sith team, where the Jedi get like six.
[18:47.50]Okay.
[18:49.64]So, okay, what if I had the kyber crystal that was in front, that was orange, and then I had like a red LED that I got from Home Depot on top, like in front of it.
[19:02.80]To make it like a red tint.
[19:04.48]Does that make me an evil person?
[19:06.82]Am I a bad guy?
[19:14.33]Why?
[19:19.40]What's with Jedi's in the color red?
[19:24.30]And get ready to be sliced up by a Jedi by having a Sith lightsaber.
[19:30.42]I can't stop it.
[19:33.22]Alright, where do I go from here?
[19:34.34]Over here.
[19:36.92]I just got him to fall damage.
[19:38.44]Alright, let's go this way.
[19:46.35]How about we just power this guy?
[19:47.67]Yep.
[19:47.91]Get powered.
[19:48.59]Alright.
[19:49.47]Nope.
[19:49.71]Alright.
[19:53.01]Slice them.
[19:53.65]No more dismemberment, by the way.
[19:55.29]It happened for like one second.
[19:57.13]We got to cut one guy's head off.
[19:58.45]Alright.
[20:02.23]Watch out.
[20:02.65]Watch out.
[20:02.87]Watch out.
[20:03.11]Watch out.
[20:03.35]Watch out.
[20:08.02]Watch out.
[20:08.30]I just Goomba stomped him.
[20:11.34]Alright.
[20:11.58]Go.
[20:11.76]Go.
[20:12.00]Go.
[20:12.24]Go.
[20:12.50]Here he comes.
[20:13.92]Oh, my God.
[20:14.52]Here comes the Rancor.
[20:18.68]Hey, look.
[20:27.42]There's a guy coming behind.
[20:32.14]Look at the guy with the two sabers.
[20:34.56]It's like, oh my God, this is my chance.
[20:35.80]This is my chance.
[20:36.48]Can I get him?
[20:37.08]Can I slice his leg off?
[20:39.82]He's laughing at us.
[20:52.03]Do something.
[20:53.89]Attack.
[20:55.51]Nice keyboard turn, Rancor.
[20:58.35]Now we know who paid for their account.
[21:05.47]Oh, he's dead.
[21:05.91]Okay.
[21:15.88]You won't get far.
[21:20.25]Alright, don't get killed.
[21:21.45]I think I have like realistic lightsabers on too, right?
[21:24.57]Is that why I'm getting killed in one hit?
[21:26.30]Basically, yeah, OK.
[21:36.39]But why even fight anything if the rancor is going to kill everybody?
[21:43.14]we could just have like look that their ai range is only that far and then they just get thank you yeah nice try look their ai range only goes so far and then eventually the rancor is just going to kill them so why am I even wasting my time do you fear me I don't he can't fit through this door can he
[22:11.40]If he just sneaks his head under here.
[22:12.86]Alright, no, dismemberment's still on.
[22:16.69]I think he just ate somebody.
[22:20.85]What?
[22:28.98]I'm trying to lead him in here.
[22:30.18]What am I doing?
[22:31.06]Oh, you idiot.
[22:34.46]Alright, get in here.
[22:43.00]I don't know why.
[22:43.54]I figured if I led them in there, he would just kill them instantly.
[22:45.76]But he killed me instantly.
[22:47.12]What an idiot.
[22:47.68]I don't even fight them.
[22:52.98]Just go.
[22:57.86]Press left and right click at the same time.
[22:59.32]Is that this guy's internal monologue?
[23:15.27]What?
[23:21.19]Why did we just get a narrator?
[23:22.29]Alright.
[23:23.51]Oh, how did he get in here?
[23:24.35]What?
[23:26.47]Um, I would love it if I could click this button.
[23:35.88]Oh my god, he doesn't stop during the cutscene.
[23:39.76]Come on.
[23:42.46]it's on easy it's not on easy you can't change the difficulty unless you reload a whole new video game what should I do checkpoint oh alright wait does he just have to press a button here am I safe in here I don't think he can do anything
[24:15.46]Now, there's a huge window right here he can come through, but can he come through it?
[24:25.90]Yes, apparently.
[24:28.65]I guess he can.
[24:29.91]Sure.
[24:33.35]Watch it.
[24:39.63]Watch it.
[24:39.99]Now, what does that do?
[24:43.92]Uh.
[24:44.34]OK, I don't.
[24:44.98]Trap it between the containers and the door.
[25:10.92]Like, he wants me to trap him right there?
[25:12.84]Just squish his head on it?
[25:14.26]But how do I... He needs to be standing there.
[25:19.71]Alright, hold on.
[25:24.37]Okay, come over to this side.
[25:25.69]Go over here.
[25:30.23]Get over here.
[25:35.52]Stop.
[25:37.02]He's stuck in the doors.
[25:42.57]Well, I think that guy's dead.
[25:43.65]He's stuck in the wall.
[25:46.31]I think if I turn him around like this... Alright, come on.
[25:52.01]Oh, you idiot.
[25:55.70]You eat me, I'm gonna be so fucking mad.
[26:03.14]Alright, come on!
[26:05.32]Get over here!
[26:11.55]It's so many slashes on him.
[26:14.21]There we go.
[26:14.61]Alright, I cut his arm.
[26:15.47]Here we go.
[26:15.81]Now, ready?
[26:16.68]Here we go.
[26:23.56]Give me the indicator!
[26:25.20]Give me the indicator.
[26:26.64]Give me the fucking... I just stabbed myself with my own blade.
[26:29.46]Oh my god.
[26:30.14]Oh my god.
[26:40.29]Isn't this the thing that comes down right here?
[26:50.50]Super speed.
[26:55.46]Another console right here.
[26:59.58]Oh, he's in slow motion.
[27:00.54]Alright.
[27:01.94]How is this a secret area?
[27:04.37]What?
[27:08.83]Alright, then lead him back here and then press it when he gets right there.
[27:15.97]Alright, press it.
[27:43.34]Is a button on here?
[27:49.96]Inside the room.
[27:57.75]I can't get... The indicator never shows up.
[28:00.13]Alright.
[28:00.73]You're here?
[28:03.11]Ramp.
[28:07.35]You will die.
[28:08.60]What the fuck is this place?
[28:11.18]Oh my god, he just instantly killed me.
[28:24.60]Yeah, it's gonna go.
[28:25.32]Maybe I can fucking stomp his head.
[28:26.82]Yeah, maybe I can fucking trap him.
[28:38.22]wouldn't this be horrible to fight in a hallway like this you had a double sided lightsaber can't you only fight in an open area he's got that head off come on
[29:11.01]oh my god this guy's unbeatable I got also used to it doesn't matter okay he's gone save it
[29:39.63]Why would I just spin it around in a circle in front of you?
[29:43.47]Like a baton.
[29:44.51]Just spin spin spin spin spin spin spin and walk forward.
[29:51.80]OK, here we go.
[29:52.48]I got him.
[29:58.18]You will die.
[29:58.72]Did I get him?
[30:07.54]I always feel like I cut my own head off.
[30:10.30]That's when you're really trying to struggle to learn how to do yo-yo tricks.
[30:20.75]And you sort of lose control when you do like around the world and you kind of you cringe your face up and you go and your mouth curses and you just wait for the yo-yo to hit you in the head.
[30:29.92]Yeah, that's what happened.
[30:39.78]Alright, let's get him.
[30:45.76]Oh no!
[30:49.43]Is he just... What?
[30:51.43]He's just waiting for his Q?
[30:55.45]Why didn't he jump over it?
[30:57.21]He's like, oh shit, I'm not in place.
[30:58.86]I gotta get into my... The theater manager's gonna be so mad at me.
[31:04.20]I wasn't where I was supposed to be.
[31:05.84]We think these cultists were planning on releasing that mutated rancor into the city and using the ensuing chaos to steal supplies, credits and whatever else they could get their hands on.
[31:15.53]Good work.
[31:19.59]He missed it.
[31:21.13]He missed his cue.
[31:22.03]It's okay.
[31:23.17]It was still a great scene.
[31:26.70]I've been tracing Tavion's movements over the past few months.
[31:30.16]It looks like she acquired the scepter from a collector on Commoner.
[31:34.12]Then she killed him.
[31:35.74]Oh.
[31:38.80]Alright.
[31:39.82]Okay, cult sighting.
[31:41.26]Force, theft, dismantle, or weapon destruction.
[31:43.94]Which one?
[31:44.16]What do you think?
[31:50.79]You have force powers other than lightning, but do they matter?
[31:58.05]Through the cult?
[32:00.17]We've received word from the Chandrillians that some cultists have broken into an ancient tomb that is supposedly the burial site of a Jedi Knight.
[32:10.04]Hurry there and stop them from siphoning that force power.
[32:12.62]If they are indeed attempting to steal force power from that tomb, Tavion might be there.
[32:20.05]He's lowering the volume a little.
[32:21.01]Sorry, I just cut off Luke.
[32:29.70]And what are you guys talking about?
[32:30.42]I have more powers?
[32:31.30]Look at, I'm already decked out.
[32:32.52]Gonna collect his force power.
[32:40.23]Yeah, wait, wait, what is this one?
[32:42.17]Jedi mind trick.
[32:44.51]Get rage, please.
[32:45.89]Force rage.
[32:49.32]Jedi is protected against 50% of all damage, has stronger attacks, and cannot die.
[32:54.32]Oh, why didn't I get this first?
[32:56.14]However, the Jedi loses health rapidly and must wait for 10 seconds after the rage before it can be used again.
[33:01.18]The Jedi must have at least 25 health to use this.
[33:05.91]Okay.
[33:09.59]I like the rocket launcher, and I like the sniper rifle.
[33:11.79]I don't even know if those are the two things I picked.
[33:13.53]It's been two days.
[33:14.37]I forget.
[33:20.68]Okay, let me keybind these.
[33:22.18]Okay, heal.
[33:27.39]Rip.
[33:28.15]Lightning.
[33:29.49]Drain.
[33:30.97]Rage.
[33:31.37]Okay, Rage is going to be... R. Rage.
[33:38.13]Drain is going to be... I don't know.
[33:43.06]Zero?
[33:44.38]No.
[33:44.66]What should it be?
[33:45.56]G?
[33:46.92]T?
[33:47.16]Okay, T. I'm never going to use it.
[33:53.80]So that's the rage power.
[33:54.82]Alright, cool.
[33:59.40]How do I turn it off?
[34:01.49]I turn it off.
[34:03.25]I have one HP.
[34:06.19]What the fuck?
[34:06.93]Alright, how do I get out of here?
[34:17.83]I don't even know who is that guy.
[34:21.43]Who is that guy?
[34:22.17]Alright, well, I don't.
[34:24.25]Sorry.
[34:24.59]Off his head goes.
[34:43.80]Off his head goes.
[34:44.78]That's not what it is.
[34:45.44]It's off with his head.
[34:49.90]He's not quite gone.
[34:50.86]There he goes.
[35:22.27]It's me, the Jedi.
[35:23.29]I'm here to save the day.
[35:24.19]Hold on just a second.
[35:29.59]Oh, that's... I thought you guys were just two regular, like, henchmen.
[35:34.44]Oh, you are.
[35:34.88]Okay, that guy's dead.
[35:41.58]Oh, shit.
[35:42.20]You blocked.
[35:49.32]Oh, see you later.
[35:50.20]There go all of his body parts too.
[35:51.64]You have to just watch your body fall.
[35:53.38]You have to watch your legs fall from your torso.
[35:56.92]Man, that's a horrible way to go.
[36:07.15]Darth Maul.
[36:09.15]Well, I mean, Darth Maul has this, but it's red.
[36:12.43]I'm not allowed to have red, apparently.
[36:14.03]Even if I like the color red, I can't just add a little bit of red LED.
[36:16.95]That makes me a bad person.
[36:18.07]These are ball breaking.
[36:23.84]Holy shit.
[36:28.62]I want to ricochet this back at him.
[36:29.66]Do you think you'd keep shooting?
[36:37.84]I don't know if I would.
[36:39.82]You know what?
[36:40.12]I would probably pick up a rock.
[36:46.29]It would be probably harder for me to hit a rock back at him.
[36:55.79]He had a family.
[36:57.45]Yeah, he also had an opportunity to stop shooting.
[37:00.37]I wouldn't have killed this guy if he just put his gun down and was like, alright.
[37:04.12]I just heard his head came off.
[37:05.84]If he put his gun down and was like, alright, I'm going to leave.
[37:07.72]I'd be like, alright, go ahead, leave.
[37:10.23]Go ahead, get up.
[37:24.28]This has got to feel real bad right now, you know?
[37:27.44]Come on.
[37:28.76]Point blank.
[37:37.71]No, stop bouncing that high.
[37:38.91]Oh, fuck.
[37:46.48]I'm sorry.
[37:47.10]I can't?
[37:57.33]Are you sure?
[37:58.75]I could go down.
[37:59.36]Is it going to hurt?
[38:06.92]Well, you just missed it by a few feet.
[38:13.09]Too bad.
[38:13.65]It was a good attempt, though.
[38:22.09]I just heard another one.
[38:26.00]What was that one for?
[38:27.99]What did that one do?
[38:32.63]I don't know.
[38:32.97]I don't know.
[38:34.97]I guess we'll never know.
[38:36.27]Alright, here we go.
[38:47.14]Save it.
[38:47.50]I haven't saved it once.
[38:50.18]Saber color one.
[38:51.12]Wait, Jeremy, you can change your saber color with the console commands.
[38:55.98]Remember, you moron, you absolute buffoon, you missed the reference.
[39:00.40]It was a reference to how Darth Maul died, and you missed it.
[39:03.31]Embarrassing reference.
[39:04.39]I just saw the word Darth Maul, because I have to... Alright, wait.
[39:08.25]Saber color in console.
[39:12.39]Change the color.
[39:14.05]Really?
[39:14.31]That doesn't work.
[39:21.78]I guarantee that's life.
[39:25.41]This is a lie.
[39:25.75]It has to be, right?
[39:26.33]Yeah, it's a lie.
[39:40.28]What is that?
[39:40.60]Okay.
[39:43.16]You guys, come on.
[39:48.80]I hate when they do that.
[39:49.54]It's not fair.
[39:57.62]Alright, let's do left click, right click.
[40:09.03]Wait, I have a better idea.
[40:10.05]Just come over here.
[40:20.37]You don't do a cartwheel to avoid my attacks up here, man.
[40:22.68]That's a bad idea.
[40:33.95]What the fuck was that?
[40:38.74]That was me pretending to know what I was doing.
[40:41.72]What was that?
[40:42.52]Hold on.
[40:46.20]Oh, it's the thing that he does in the movie.
[40:50.65]It's the guaranteed way to die in real life if you ever did this with a weapon.
[40:57.49]A little flourish, not your head is off.
[41:04.42]Imagine that back when the medieval times and people actually using weapons like this, they allowed each other to dance around.
[41:09.30]Or five seconds.
[41:12.14]No.
[41:13.28]No, it was brutal and horrible.
[41:15.48]If there was an opportunity, that sword's going right through your stomach.
[41:22.03]would be brutal holy shit hold on wait a second let me do this first I'm trying to kill him with it
[41:57.23]Alright, finally.
[41:59.36]We got a raid?
[41:59.86]We did?
[42:00.12]Oh shit, we did.
[42:01.52]This is from Daleks.
[42:05.06]Thanks to the raid, Daleks.
[42:06.78]Hope we had a good stream.
[42:07.86]Whatever it was.
[42:08.60]Hey, you may have been playing Jedi Force Academy.
[42:11.93]And if you were playing Jedi Force Academy, then good for you.
[42:16.85]Welcome, guys.
[42:21.13]Is that a kyber crystal over there?
[42:29.71]Is this like a kyber crystal dungeon?
[42:33.83]Can I make that jump?
[42:37.61]Of course I can.
[42:38.11]I'm a Jedi.
[42:42.33]No raid song?
[42:50.41]There it is.
[42:50.71]It's the raid song.
[42:52.19]This place is confusing.
[42:56.79]Step them from dissecting the tomb.
[43:00.50]Okay.
[43:00.60]Where should I go?
[43:16.07]Flourish.
[43:20.17]Flourish.
[43:23.81]He just gets lost.
[43:25.43]So he started dancing around.
[43:39.64]I literally w- No, I did the Super Mario thing where you jump and you're terrified and you're panicked about missing a jump.
[43:47.40]You land the jump, but then go, fuck!
[43:49.88]And jump again when you're right on the edge of the first jump that you actually made.
[43:54.12]So, I'm sorry.
[43:54.76]Is this the wrong way?
[44:07.06]There we go.
[44:07.86]That's what I wanted to do.
[44:09.20]I'm going back.
[44:20.45]You were killed where you killed those guys, isn't it?
[44:22.97]Yeah, it's back here, right?
[44:24.89]Yeah.
[44:26.61]I'm not on like a two or three second delay, am I again?
[44:48.05]What do I go from here?
[44:53.33]Check.
[44:54.37]Check.
[44:58.64]Alright, ready?
[44:59.02]I'm going to clap and you tell me when you hear the clap.
[45:01.00]Clap!
[45:06.36]Wow, that's actually kind of long.
[45:07.68]Why is that long?
[45:09.14]It should be like three seconds.
[45:10.06]Why is it like seven or eight?
[45:11.02]I'm going to do it again.
[45:12.96]I don't think you guys are ready for it.
[45:19.13]Hmm.
[45:20.41]Why is that long today?
[45:21.13]Alright, well I gotta go up there.
[45:27.61]Up there.
[45:28.07]There's something I can do up there.
[45:35.24]There's like an orange thing up there.
[45:39.18]You're ignoring us.
[45:40.16]What are you talking about?
[45:40.74]I'm not ignoring you guys.
[45:41.40]What are you talking about?
[45:41.94]What are you guys talking about?
[45:50.84]Here we go.
[45:51.36]Okay.
[45:56.22]Shit.
[45:58.07]Check the doors in the chamber.
[46:01.59]Is this going to fall damage to kill me?
[46:02.99]Holy shit, it almost did if I didn't heal.
[46:09.31]I cannot read entire coffee pasta.
[46:12.26]The chat's going too fast, dude.
[46:13.92]How am I supposed to do that?
[46:15.36]Oh, I see it.
[46:21.60]What?
[46:23.20]What happened?
[46:27.08]There's no enemies in this room.
[46:28.36]There's no bombs or traps in this room.
[46:34.23]That doesn't make any sense at all.
[46:45.04]What actually happened though?
[46:47.85]The screen started shaking.
[46:49.17]Was the rancor back?
[46:52.19]Okay, now let's force push.
[46:54.70]Electric lightning attack.
[46:56.68]Swing.
[47:04.28]Pull.
[47:07.79]Oh, I opened it.
[47:08.25]Alright, cool.
[47:10.47]Why does my screen look all weird?
[47:15.47]Yellow saber is underpowered.
[47:17.97]It's who's wielding it, not who's fucking... Power level it is.
[47:25.69]It's just a bright beam of hot light.
[47:27.47]That's all that is.
[47:37.95]Oh my god, dude.
[47:44.30]Well, apparently I'm not...
[47:51.22]Keep telling yourself that.
[47:52.24]Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[47:54.27]Look, I can go to single, too.
[47:56.09]I'm going to try that.
[47:57.35]I'd rather... I'm going single for now.
[47:59.47]Let's see.
[48:03.91]Jedi rage mode coming in.
[48:05.05]He choked me to death.
[48:17.02]Get over here.
[48:17.78]You will die by mine.
[48:23.40]Yes.
[48:24.62]Let the rage flow through you, young master padawan.
[48:30.30]Let the rage fuel you.
[48:31.94]Holy shit.
[48:36.20]Where did you come from?
[48:36.94]It's time to add a second blade.
[48:52.94]Get over here.
[49:11.85]I was in slow motion.
[49:14.39]Why was it in fast-
[49:21.14]Why was that in fast motion?
[49:24.04]Alright, now it's my turn.
[49:25.16]Fuck off.
[49:25.84]Get out of here.
[49:27.24]Somebody just gave a shitload of money.
[49:29.47]That's 69 community subs from ZapEx.
[49:32.21]That's 69 community subs.
[49:34.29]The funny number.
[49:38.39]That's a huge amount of subs, dude.
[49:39.73]Thank you.
[49:40.07]That's insane.
[49:42.09]Insane.
[49:47.30]Oh, come on.
[49:49.04]You got to be fucking kidding me.
[49:51.60]I just want to kick a guy off the edge.
[49:57.30]Okay.
[49:57.64]Well, that worked.
[49:58.70]Wait a minute.
[50:03.48]Hmm.
[50:18.33]That's how you get that shit done.
[50:24.04]What about you?
[50:24.44]Can I take you out with a blaster rifle?
[50:30.62]Ow, no, no, no, no, no.
[50:32.42]Did he just launch those back at me?
[50:34.34]Holy shit.
[50:36.08]How are you doing that?
[50:37.58]Way to go.
[50:49.23]Alright.
[50:50.11]Okay.
[50:54.29]oh my god I just annihilated this guy what what happened
[51:23.97]Oh, I didn't have full health.
[51:25.23]Right.
[51:38.36]Nice.
[51:38.84]Flourish.
[51:51.46]What am I supposed to do?
[51:53.12]I don't know.
[51:53.60]Fucking kill him.
[52:16.81]Watch out.
[52:17.07]Watch this guy strong.
[52:17.73]Back it up.
[52:18.84]Let go of me.
[52:19.28]Let go.
[52:30.99]Got him.
[52:32.59]Okay.
[52:33.83]I did it.
[52:40.12]Use force push.
[52:40.86]It's so weak, it doesn't work on people.
[52:44.58]I can't.
[52:50.86]Can I force choke from all the way back here?
[53:00.12]How do I get over there?
[53:00.76]Okay.
[53:01.18]I'm going to... I can just jump.
[53:09.00]Can't I?
[53:09.31]I pressed it.
[53:18.19]I got it.
[53:23.90]Let's kill this guy first.
[53:30.70]Isn't there two?
[53:32.16]The fuck are you doing?
[53:47.75]like though I know what that's like dude it's fucking hard to keep your footing you could have just stepped down okay let's go there was I've been there before plenty of times okay so from here we're gonna go this way save Jerma I got it
[54:28.89]both of us clearly have no idea what the fuck we're doing like it's very clear
[54:47.99]hey is that he died twice okay we're gonna go uh over yeah easy where do I go from here should I go up no this way down
[55:18.73]I mean, I feel like I have to go down there, but I have to go that way.
[55:21.31]Okay, hold on.
[55:25.16]F8 for the fart and burp mechanic.
[55:26.82]It's real.
[55:27.74]Oh, cool.
[55:28.34]Let me press it.
[55:44.92]Can you imagine if they actually added that?
[55:55.87]This place is amazing.
[55:59.19]It seems like it goes on forever.
[56:02.02]That'd be so stupid.
[56:03.72]F8?
[56:05.28]F8.
[56:08.10]F8.
[56:09.04]That's the fucking stupidest thing ever.
[56:14.61]Why would they add that?
[56:15.53]That doesn't make any sense.
[56:16.45]Do Jedi's even like... Great.
[56:19.73]How am I going to get down there without breaking my neck?
[56:23.92]How am I going to get down there without breaking my neck?
[56:31.09]Get to full health and jump and hope it doesn't kill you.
[56:37.05]Don't land on your neck, Omega Lull.
[56:46.48]Okay, yeah, we can do Rage.
[56:58.17]I have no health.
[57:13.99]No, don't do it.
[57:16.93]I'm okay.
[57:23.77]Got it.
[57:24.07]Okay.
[57:24.63]Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[57:31.95]I had no force power left.
[57:33.05]That was bad.
[57:33.57]Let's just snipe this guy.
[57:38.69]What did he hit his head?
[57:39.45]What?
[57:40.01]How did he do that?
[57:40.53]That was weird.
[57:52.02]Uh.
[57:54.36]Wait.
[57:56.72]Did I do this wrong?
[58:13.62]Oh shit, this is bad.
[58:14.82]Um, no, hold on.
[58:38.73]Um...
[58:41.48]I think I might be in trouble.
[58:43.28]I jumped all the way down here and I don't think I was supposed to do that.
[58:54.47]Can I make it up on the bridge?
[59:01.90]Oh, I see.
[59:02.94]Not soft locked.
[59:22.56]Two at the same time.
[59:24.66]A Jedi's worst nightmare.
[59:32.95]Oh, just barely have your footing.
[59:34.55]That was a smart move, but it didn't work out for you.
[59:51.69]New objective.
[59:52.25]Why is my game slowing down?
[60:01.14]Are they letting me in?
[60:07.34]Okay.
[60:08.18]Fuck you guys.
[60:13.32]I'm just going in the chamber.
[60:14.70]Get out of my fucking way.
[60:19.53]There's one guy sitting in the middle.
[60:21.37]I feel like he's strongest.
[60:24.05]He is.
[60:24.55]He's got the double.
[60:25.15]Okay.
[60:27.02]What's in the... Should I go in here?
[60:28.22]Oh, wait.
[60:30.88]They're desecrating.
[60:31.74]Alright.
[60:32.04]Stop desecrating.
[60:32.84]This is the same guy.
[60:38.16]Oh, my God.
[60:38.86]Okay.
[60:54.51]Alright, all of you get in here.
[60:56.09]No, I was going to do that to you.
[61:05.26]Stop, I want to do something to you guys.
[61:06.92]Stop, I just cut that guy's lightsaber in half.
[61:15.36]Wait, I'm deflecting their lightsabers back at them?
[61:32.52]Oh shit, they're all working together.
[61:33.94]That guy got impatient.
[61:40.00]Let's see.
[61:40.50]I want to test their patience.
[61:46.63]These are the Sith Ritz brothers.
[62:00.27]Holy shit, he made it.
[62:01.25]No, he didn't.
[62:02.67]He was just showing me he could.
[62:03.71]Okay, but wait.
[62:12.52]If they deflect it, won't it... They just instantly fucking deflect.
[62:16.72]Instantly.
[62:17.66]It doesn't matter.
[62:18.18]Look.
[62:19.38]I shot it in the fucking air.
[62:20.46]It doesn't even matter.
[62:24.06]Watch this.
[62:32.93]Okay, yeah.
[62:34.25]Sure.
[62:40.87]Yeah.
[62:41.35]Oh, you weren't even there.
[62:42.51]You weren't even there.
[62:44.11]You weren't even in the right spot.
[62:45.63]Unbelievable.
[62:46.33]Alright, I'm done.
[62:48.41]I'm done.
[62:48.75]This is where you die.
[62:49.57]You're all gonna die.
[63:01.35]Let go.
[63:02.81]That's so unfair.
[63:03.71]Let fucking go of me.
[63:10.17]Force push.
[63:10.67]Force push doesn't work on people.
[63:11.71]It's not strong enough.
[63:15.33]Jesus.
[63:18.55]Alright.
[63:18.85]I'm going to fight you guys on my terms.
[63:20.49]Let's go.
[63:22.25]This does.
[63:22.69]Watch.
[63:22.97]Ready?
[63:23.59]Force push.
[63:28.27]Wow.
[63:29.51]That was very useful.
[63:42.21]That's not even a cool power.
[63:46.99]That's not lightning.
[63:47.65]That's not choke.
[63:49.70]That's not resurrect the dead.
[63:55.58]No, you can't speak of that power, Jeremy.
[63:59.44]Alright, I'm going to do rage.
[64:20.69]I know where you are, Jedi.
[64:24.29]Where are you hiding?
[64:31.09]They can't kill me!
[64:34.09]Alright, I'm done with these three.
[64:36.60]I'm done with these guys.
[64:37.50]I really am.
[64:38.80]Fucking kill them.
[64:54.50]Alright, I can't fight three.
[65:02.87]Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.
[65:03.09]Block block block block block block block.
[65:06.29]I got him. Okay, got one.
[65:10.29]Back it up, back it up, back it up.
[65:11.29]Heal.
[65:18.65]Got it.
[65:18.89]Okay.
[65:19.15]That was a nice little maneuver.
[65:20.39]Sidestepped him.
[65:21.83]Just one more.
[65:23.01]One more.
[65:23.29]Now he's going to get aggressive.
[65:24.43]Good.
[65:24.73]I can do that too.
[65:25.45]Let's go, motherfucker.
[65:26.23]Let's do it.
[65:26.59]I love that Darth Maul move.
[65:52.20]Okay, I did it.
[65:54.54]Defeat the Jedi and find a way to protect the Jedi.
[65:57.94]What?
[66:01.26]Defeat the Jedi and find a way to protect the Jedi's coffin.
[66:04.03]What do you mean the Jedi?
[66:04.87]He's a Jedi?
[66:07.57]Ooh, I see.
[66:23.34]Force pull.
[66:27.00]What is this big button for?
[66:28.08]Okay, so pull it.
[66:46.34]The big button.
[66:52.44]Push the button.
[66:58.38]I can't push it.
[67:02.76]Do you pull buttons?
[67:03.92]No, but apparently you can't push buttons either in this universe.
[67:06.67]Push.
[67:08.79]I already did.
[67:12.11]What am I supposed to do?
[67:12.73]Push the other button.
[67:13.25]Oh.
[67:13.39]I thought I did that already.
[67:14.23]I did force push.
[67:30.28]This whole building is collapsing.
[67:31.48]Alright, it's just a shell.
[67:46.25]Doesn't actually do anything.
[67:54.66]It's gonna blow!
[67:56.62]It's gonna blow!
[68:11.99]So you didn't run into Tavion.
[68:13.81]That's good.
[68:14.61]I think I did it.
[68:15.53]Bad.
[68:16.62]At least you stopped the cultists.
[68:18.44]But we can't keep this up forever.
[68:20.16]We've got to stop Tavion once and for all.
[68:22.44]We have to stop Tavion.
[68:26.88]Luke and I have been trying to find out what Tavion could be hoping to do with Ragnos's scepter.
[68:31.69]But so far, no luck.
[68:33.69]Keep your ears open for any rovers.
[68:38.15]A quick little shake on that heel.
[68:43.11]NK Thomas.
[68:44.23]Yeah, whatever.
[68:44.67]Alright, how about this?
[68:48.66]Which one's better?
[68:49.22]It was disgusting.
[68:57.36]It was just liquid shaking in a container.
[68:59.38]That's disgusting to you?
[69:04.68]When you, like, take a bath, are you disgusted by the sound the water makes when you move around?
[69:08.50]If you take your hand and go into the water, do you go... Oh, my God.
[69:16.84]What?
[69:17.32]It's just liquid.
[69:20.10]Now we're going to dismantle the device.
[69:23.88]A resident Jedi scholar, Keon, recently learned of the planet Yalara from our Jedi holocron.
[69:32.48]The planet was once home to a peaceful yet primitive species that was not ready to be integrated into galactic society.
[69:38.93]For this reason, the Jedi Master Broden Kel Verdox harnessed the power of the planet to create a cloaking device, hiding the entire planet from discovery, but to the disarray of the entire planet because everything disappeared.
[69:53.34]Buildings, roads, ground, people.
[69:57.16]Created a major, major problem.
[69:59.72]Running into people on the sidewalk accidentally.
[70:09.14]But now if someone else has discovered Yallara, go to Yallara and find out if anyone has been there.
[70:12.32]If the cloaking device is in danger of being stolen, it'd be better to destroy it rather than have it fall into the wrong hands.
[70:22.16]Sidewalk is still there.
[70:23.08]Whatever.
[70:24.76]Alright, destroy the planet.
[70:25.38]You got it.
[70:25.74]I got you, Luke.
[70:36.68]Alright, Force Rage is 75%.
[70:38.67]Force Drain is... No, let's do this.
[70:44.91]I like this one.
[70:57.60]Where's the sniper rifle?
[70:59.00]No, that thing sucks.
[70:59.84]Why do I even want it?
[71:01.95]I like these two.
[71:03.19]Let's go.
[71:13.77]Force push, then force choke.
[71:15.29]It do be simple.
[71:16.11]Alright, I'll try it.
[71:29.10]Alright.
[71:29.92]I don't like the orange anymore.
[71:30.80]Alright.
[71:36.73]So I have a question for you, Star Wars lore masters.
[71:41.03]If at any point in my 40 plus year tenure as a Jedi, if I get sick of the color orange, can I just change the color?
[71:51.45]Can I be like, hey, I've been using orange for 15 years.
[71:55.86]I kind of want green.
[71:58.10]Is that OK?
[72:07.00]Stop asking about the sabers.
[72:10.00]Why?
[72:11.50]I can't ask.
[72:12.12]I can't ask a question about lightsaber lore and stuff, but I'm.
[72:18.19]Is he shooting at me?
[72:33.64]OK.
[72:39.94]Where are you going to go?
[72:54.61]Where are you going to go?
[72:56.45]I'm blocking the door.
[72:57.85]Where are you going to go?
[72:59.31]Come on.
[72:59.47]Where are you going to go?
[73:01.21]I'm like the big brother.
[73:02.88]The little brother's like trying to get to dinner.
[73:04.34]You can't go.
[73:04.72]You're trying to get upstairs.
[73:05.70]You little squirt.
[73:07.64]I'm trying to get upstairs.
[73:08.34]Mom.
[73:09.73]You're not getting up there.
[73:12.59]By the way, I'm gonna eat your Oreos.
[73:14.69]No, you're not.
[73:15.85]Yes, I am.
[73:16.13]I'm gonna eat all your Oreos, dude.
[73:20.01]Alright, fine.
[73:20.63]You can get through.
[73:21.37]Fine, good.
[73:22.17]Mom, we're coming down.
[73:23.17]I'm gonna eat your Oreos.
[73:26.39]You're not gonna eat my Oreos.
[73:28.09]I'm gonna eat all your Oreos.
[73:35.09]Okay, that part of the joke is over.
[73:41.41]We're now in the game again.
[73:42.30]Imperial!
[73:50.10]Oh wait, these are the Imperials.
[73:53.62]Sorry!
[74:10.71]Hold on a second.
[74:12.21]A few of the customers got lost.
[74:14.17]I have to pick them up with the pinch tool and put them back on the path.
[74:17.90]You guys need to ride my new roller coaster.
[74:19.52]Get over here.
[74:19.92]What are you doing?
[74:24.90]I just saved you.
[74:37.36]Alright.
[74:38.84]Alright.
[74:39.46]Alright.
[74:39.78]I'm going to let you go.
[74:40.62]I'm going to let you go.
[74:43.34]You are free to go.
[74:50.77]I am going to watch you leave.
[74:52.01]Because I feel like there's a chance.
[74:57.25]I knew it.
[74:57.63]Okay.
[74:57.99]I didn't push him.
[75:00.87]I didn't push him.
[75:02.10]I didn't push him.
[75:04.26]You know what?
[75:04.66]Fuck this whole room.
[75:07.44]That was a big voice crack.
[75:08.62]Worst voice crack of the year.
[75:09.96]Nomination number one.
[75:11.38]That's probably a new category.
[75:12.44]That's a new category for next year.
[75:15.72]I didn't even do anything.
[75:16.56]I just knew he was going to walk.
[75:23.80]I didn't force push him.
[75:24.76]I just walked.
[75:41.05]Get out of here, stormtrooper.
[75:43.43]Stormtrooper scum.
[75:54.22]It's like burning this guy.
[76:02.14]Holy shit.
[76:03.04]Why is this guy not still alive?
[76:04.46]Why is he still alive?
[76:06.30]This is horrible.
[76:07.10]He needs to be dead now.
[76:10.15]oh my god wait where did that guy come from press this button and press this button alright let's go let's go let's go go go go
[76:42.04]How do I go through here?
[76:49.86]Sing another raid song?
[76:52.45]Oh, what's up, Tyler?
[76:53.29]Thanks for the raid.
[76:54.83]Thanks for the raid, Tyler.
[77:01.33]Didn't I say I was never going to do that again?
[77:05.09]I promised I was never going to do that sound again.
[77:11.53]I said there'd never be a raid song again.
[77:13.80]And I've done it twice today.
[77:16.70]But thanks for the raid.
[77:17.52]Welcome guys.
[77:19.02]We're playing Jedi Force Jedi Training.
[77:24.44]It's pretty fun.
[77:25.05]It's something like that.
[77:25.81]Should I go up?
[77:33.05]Holy shit, that's going to kill me.
[77:38.74]What am I missing here?
[77:47.68]Are there mods on?
[77:48.26]There are no mods on right now.
[77:49.94]I've never played the game.
[77:50.86]I'm just doing the vanilla storyline.
[77:52.74]I feel like I'm missing something.
[78:04.99]Am I missing something?
[78:06.60]You already did the thing.
[78:07.86]Oh.
[78:23.64]Alright, let's go up.
[78:27.83]There are no mods?
[78:28.59]Yes, there are.
[78:28.97]Alright, so then I jump through there because that's the fan I stopped.
[78:33.33]Let me save it.
[78:42.85]I did that really sloppily, but I feel like I did that correctly somehow.
[78:47.39]Okay, more people to wait.
[78:48.83]I have people to throw into the disintegration ray.
[78:52.88]No, I don't.
[78:53.96]There's Jedi's, I can't.
[78:59.66]He cut my head off, but there was a head there.
[79:02.58]That was weird.
[79:11.51]Whoops.
[79:12.93]Got him.
[79:15.01]Double head.
[79:18.94]A galactic war has begun.
[79:22.75]Who will win in this galactic war?
[79:24.65]That's like a YouTuber thing.
[79:27.43]I am a YouTuber.
[79:28.31]What am I talking about?
[79:29.05]Are they working together?
[79:47.12]Right there, right in the arm.
[79:49.70]YouTuber Andy.
[79:53.34]Don't shoot at me.
[80:00.92]Stop, get out of here.
[80:03.09]Alright, I gave you a chance and now you're not getting any other chances.
[80:20.66]Don't miss this.
[80:27.11]Okay.
[80:29.13]We're sick.
[80:30.27]Recharge my orange.
[80:34.63]And take a look at this up here.
[80:35.94]Cool.
[80:36.52]I think this is just a look.
[80:46.06]End of the stream voice.
[80:47.12]No.
[80:48.02]No.
[80:50.73]Just because I bring my tone down to here to kind of like a normal speaking range does not mean the stream is going to end in five minutes.
[80:58.64]Like this is my, I'm bringing it down to my normal kind of tone.
[81:01.76]This is my real voice alert.
[81:04.46]Got him.
[81:04.86]I disintegrated him.
[81:07.01]No, it doesn't.
[81:07.87]It doesn't.
[81:08.47]Look, this is my normal speaking range, right?
[81:11.01]If I'm just like talking on the phone with somebody.
[81:14.51]If somebody called me right now, I'd answer the phone.
[81:17.51]What's up?
[81:19.22]What's going on?
[81:21.35]Yeah, I just ended stream.
[81:23.07]I'm cool.
[81:24.75]What's going on with you?
[81:27.29]Yeah, it's not end of the stream voice.
[81:32.59]Normal voice Andy.
[81:33.81]Can we go up again?
[81:44.76]You can tell they're friends.
[81:45.58]Now you just watched him die.
[82:16.27]What?
[82:17.33]Oh, shit.
[82:17.89]What's happening?
[82:19.95]What's firing at me?
[82:22.09]Who's firing?
[82:22.91]Oh, you.
[82:23.70]What?
[82:32.65]This does not look sturdy at all.
[82:37.44]This has got a little wood plank bridge.
[82:46.84]No, that won't fall.
[82:47.94]That's not going to fall here in a minute.
[82:57.36]Force pull or stab.
[83:11.74]Wait, save it.
[83:13.26]Okay, I'm ready.
[83:13.72]Hold on, let me heal first.
[83:17.38]Let me get to 100.
[83:18.20]We'll both be at 100 and then it's okay.
[83:30.09]I win.
[83:31.33]I win the duel.
[83:31.97]Yeah, you're the guild mates.
[83:35.85]Come on in.
[83:44.04]Tried to make it look like that was intentional.
[83:46.82]And just one guy left that doesn't have a lightsaber.
[83:58.25]Fucking WoW streamer.
[83:59.49]No, I'm a WoW... Ex-WoW player.
[84:02.41]Not a current WoW streamer.
[84:08.98]I was gonna say that.
[84:10.06]You really just stepped over on my toes there.
[84:12.90]Sorry.
[84:25.29]Oh, I see you got some force rage.
[84:37.04]You are very good at the game.
[84:38.72]I thought Jedi were powerful.
[84:56.84]Hey!
[85:21.31]Did I squish somebody?
[85:22.21]I think I crushed somebody like a pancake.
[85:26.03]What's happening?
[85:28.75]Save it.
[85:29.07]Save it right here.
[85:29.57]Quick.
[85:37.18]What's happening?
[85:41.82]Oh, come on.
[85:42.36]Whatever.
[85:50.75]You guys are annoying.
[85:57.21]Oh my fucking God.
[85:58.61]Get... I don't want to wait for this.
[86:09.90]One, two.
[86:16.26]Woo.
[86:16.56]Okay.
[86:19.24]What's that do?
[86:21.48]Oh, I gotta plant some bombs.
[86:25.56]A true gamer spams force lightning.
[86:31.59]You're right.
[86:34.33]You're actually right.
[86:48.75]What?
[86:49.59]I pulled that guy through the wall?
[86:51.25]Wait, that guy wasn't even here.
[86:52.46]That guy... Somebody's dying.
[86:59.24]Is that... Oh, okay.
[87:09.53]I think I did it.
[87:14.55]Darth Vader's in the game.
[87:20.85]He lied about X-Men Origins Wolverine.
[87:21.91]I did, yeah.
[87:23.01]I was supposed to play that a long time ago.
[87:24.65]Alright, we got three more missions left.
[87:26.27]Force, theft, investigation, or weapon destruction.
[87:27.76]Which one?
[87:52.96]I'm going to say force theft.
[87:56.72]Since Rosh never completed his mission at Biz, we still need to determine if Tavion managed to siphon force energy from the remains of the planet.
[88:04.84]The Emperor spent a lot of time there, so it would be a huge source of power.
[88:10.81]If it has been taken, we'll have an idea of just how powerful Tavion is.
[88:13.91]I'm going with you on this one.
[88:15.59]Rosh disappeared near Biz, and it's too dangerous for anyone to go alone.
[88:21.75]So take this.
[88:25.20]Alright, Force Rage level 3 is Jedi's protected against 90% of all damage.
[88:30.80]It's 50% faster and has stronger attacks and cannot die.
[88:33.40]Yeah.
[88:34.82]I wasn't making that... I was making a dumb reference.
[88:38.28]Leave me alone.
[88:46.81]Red Saber this time.
[88:48.45]I don't sense the dark side here, Kyle.
[88:50.73]Me neither.
[88:52.26]Where?
[88:52.88]Oh, that's us.
[88:54.16]No, that's them.
[88:54.58]How did you not see him pulling up?
[89:00.19]We were very ill-prepared for this.
[89:31.67]How did we we just kind of got in here?
[89:37.25]Go.
[89:40.92]I can I can help.
[89:45.02]We do it together to go faster.
[89:52.61]Sorry.
[89:54.37]Let's concentrate it in the same spot, man.
[89:58.66]Oh well.
[90:07.27]I guess I gotta disable the tractor beam or something.
[90:11.03]You get to do the fun thing, I get to do the boring thing.
[90:37.76]The amount of times you see somebody's head come off.
[90:39.78]Yeah, run, run, run away from this guy.
[90:45.88]Run away from me.
[90:48.02]Run away.
[90:50.90]There's an absolutely unhinged psycho.
[90:57.02]God, if they knew I was doing this at the academy, this would be all over my report card.
[91:00.41]I'd have to get a signature from my parents if they knew I was doing this.
[91:02.81]Alright, I got a security key card.
[91:27.10]Why are they just crumbling?
[91:29.90]Are these even people?
[91:30.80]Holy shit.
[91:35.90]These guys are popping.
[91:37.56]They're just popping around.
[91:38.78]Holy shit.
[91:40.64]I didn't save it.
[91:42.28]No.
[91:42.89]God damn it.
[91:50.31]Where am I?
[91:52.05]What just happened?
[91:52.79]What the fuck are you doing?
[91:54.83]What happened?
[91:56.13]Why did that happen?
[91:59.35]What the fuck just happened?
[92:05.01]Is this the right one?
[92:05.57]I need a low checkpoint, right?
[92:18.60]I loaded the quick save.
[92:20.60]Oh man.
[92:21.10]I just got a literal call, like an actual game actually hard crushed.
[92:27.19]Okay.
[92:32.41]Yeah, where the save state really fucks everything up.
[92:39.39]When you haven't done it in a while and you're just using regular saves and you press save state, just load state, and you're four hours ago.
[92:46.38]That's happened a million times before.
[92:47.66]Alright, load checkpoint.
[92:48.48]There we go.
[92:56.55]I don't sense the dark side here, Kyle.
[93:08.21]I was trying to die on his lightsaber.
[93:10.17]Let's go.
[93:13.91]I could interact with that, but I just saw red.
[93:18.54]Sorry, everyone.
[93:19.82]Oh, that's unforgivable.
[93:20.64]People are going to be so mad at me for that one.
[93:22.54]I was trying to interact, but I didn't.
[93:24.26]Oh, people are going to be really upset.
[93:26.07]That's everyone's favorite character.
[93:27.25]People love that thing.
[93:28.03]People love that little guy.
[93:31.23]Oh, no.
[93:36.61]Oh my god.
[93:37.23]I'm so sorry.
[93:38.01]I really am so sorry.
[93:41.39]People are going to be so upset about that.
[93:47.01]Bop it.
[93:47.67]Twist it.
[93:53.40]It really is the same one.
[93:54.60]Why don't you come in?
[94:01.98]I'm surrounded.
[94:02.76]Are you sure?
[94:03.22]Are you sure it's not you two stuck in a room?
[94:17.94]Got the security key.
[94:19.06]I don't care.
[94:23.14]Is there in a shooting gallery?
[94:24.70]Yeah, they kind of were.
[94:25.39]Are you sure you're not the bad guy?
[94:31.77]I mean, I probably am.
[94:38.60]You're asking me for ID.
[94:39.72]Now is not the time to ask me for ID.
[94:52.01]What the fuck are- why is there a space marine here?
[94:54.91]Why are there space marines behind me?
[94:57.67]Wait, what?
[95:13.96]I'm not fucking with these guys.
[95:21.46]Oh, shit.
[95:22.12]Okay, go, go, go.
[95:22.74]Run, run, run, run.
[95:27.18]Did they follow me in here?
[95:28.04]What did that do?
[95:31.44]Did that guy disable the tractor beam?
[95:35.50]Oh, fuck.
[95:36.48]Incoming TIE fighters.
[95:55.93]I'll be right there, Anakin.
[96:10.22]Wait, they cut me off.
[96:13.26]These guys, they actually cut me off.
[96:16.70]Be serious.
[96:17.20]I know what to do.
[96:25.36]Really?
[96:27.89]Wait!
[96:28.27]I got turned around.
[96:28.85]Oh my god.
[96:30.41]Damn it.
[96:30.69]Where's the safe?
[96:45.55]Alright.
[96:45.75]We're good.
[96:45.97]We're good.
[96:46.25]We're good.
[96:46.56]We're good.
[96:59.55]Alright, let me heal.
[97:03.59]Oh, wait, wait, the tractor beam.
[97:04.98]You're right.
[97:16.16]Tractor beam disabled.
[97:18.81]I need more time.
[97:31.27]man.
[97:32.21]I can't.
[97:34.23]Oh, what the fuck are you guys doing over here?
[97:37.37]It didn't kill him.
[97:53.88]That didn't kill him.
[97:54.50]That didn't kill him.
[97:57.10]Help me toaster.
[98:15.82]I need 25 health to do here we go rage I
[98:30.12]Damn it, you fucking stupid thing.
[98:31.98]Alright, just stop here.
[98:39.00]Activate Rage.
[98:51.69]Die!
[98:52.21]Oh my god!
[98:53.11]I'm just gonna sit here and get to full health and then full health.
[98:57.45]No, god damn it, this sucks.
[99:25.69]Combine rage with force speed.
[99:28.05]Hold on.
[99:46.62]Run, run, run, run away.
[99:47.38]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[99:48.58]Get away.
[100:00.45]Alright, they're dead.
[100:07.11]I win.
[100:07.55]Good.
[100:11.62]That was hard.
[100:13.26]That's fucking hard.
[100:29.59]Tractor beam disabled.
[100:32.77]Head back to the ship.
[100:33.84]I just need a little more time.
[100:38.42]The wrong way.
[100:41.24]Save.
[100:41.44]Save.
[100:41.54]I got it.
[100:41.88]Is this the wrong way?
[100:42.97]Wait.
[100:43.15]No.
[100:43.23]I... What happened?
[101:21.66]Oh shit, huge guys again.
[101:22.98]All these guys, these guys are huge.
[101:36.45]Save, I just did.
[101:38.49]Alright, I'm ready.
[101:39.07]I'm gonna do force run, force slash, force jump, force spin, force dance.
[101:47.15]In that order.
[101:47.71]One, two, three, go.
[102:01.92]Worked.
[102:09.66]Fucking attack him!
[102:11.12]What's going on?
[102:12.76]Um, okay.
[102:13.72]What?
[102:15.68]You have an air gun?
[102:19.01]What do you have for a weapon?
[102:21.22]What does this guy have for a weapon?
[102:29.75]Get the fuck out of here.
[102:30.75]Alright.
[102:42.52]Oh, well.
[102:43.90]I could do a better power than that one.
[102:49.47]That's better.
[102:50.39]I feel better about that one.
[103:04.71]Security cards.
[103:14.69]Is this on story only mode?
[103:19.00]No, this is on normal.
[103:20.84]I'm just very powerful.
[103:22.50]I've leveled up... Okay.
[103:34.06]Right.
[103:50.77]Okay, hold on.
[103:53.09]Use the rockets.
[103:53.89]Hold on a minute.
[103:57.45]Hold on a minute.
[103:57.89]What's this room?
[103:58.44]Excuse me.
[103:59.98]Let me clear this out real quick.
[104:03.52]Oh, wait.
[104:03.74]That's not a person.
[104:04.80]Alright.
[104:05.02]Well, you kind of were in there.
[104:07.30]You good?
[104:08.54]Are you good?
[104:09.14]Alright.
[104:09.44]I want you to recite the Rebel Alliance motto.
[104:16.94]We will always fight for justice.
[104:18.36]You didn't get it.
[104:34.01]Stop!
[104:34.72]Stop shooting at me.
[104:35.18]This guy's ready.
[104:51.00]Thank you.
[104:58.27]Oh, please.
[105:01.94]Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[105:03.52]I don't have a time.
[105:10.35]Come on.
[105:15.79]What do I do if I put this lightsaber off?
[105:28.02]He's doing the right thing, dog.
[105:29.34]Oh.
[105:39.01]Yeah, I informed the commander.
[105:41.25]Oh no, he did it.
[105:43.61]He actually did it.
[105:45.53]I can't believe it.
[106:01.00]Not this time.
[106:01.86]I'm sorry, that's not going to happen.
[106:12.05]What's going on?
[106:12.51]What's with all the sounds?
[106:24.76]Literally died to a stormtrooper.
[106:26.24]Yeah.
[106:33.21]Cards?
[106:33.53]Nope.
[106:35.61]Right?
[106:36.67]Everyone yells at me when I don't get this.
[106:44.55]And it's gone now.
[106:49.84]Easy.
[106:50.24]That was right in the head.
[107:02.52]Nice.
[107:09.33]I have to put a stormtrooper in the rumble now.
[107:15.49]I guess you're right.
[107:16.23]Specifically that stormtrooper.
[107:20.65]Not that stormtrooper, that stormtrooper.
[107:22.96]Whatever.
[107:23.26]Alright, I'm not going to kill the trash compactor.
[107:37.13]I'm going to pet the trash compactor.
[107:38.59]I think that's what you can do.
[107:39.39]It's getting too close though.
[107:41.55]I have to do this.
[107:42.05]OK, pet trash compactor, pet trash compactor.
[108:01.39]What am I doing?
[108:16.48]He just got scared.
[108:23.51]I'm not going to do it.
[108:24.17]Why would I do it?
[108:24.73]There's no reason for that trash compactor to get destroyed.
[108:26.69]Here we go.
[108:36.62]Die, die, die, die, die, die, die.
[108:48.43]Die.
[108:57.07]Activate.
[109:11.80]Look, I'm not Han Solo, okay?
[109:13.72]This is not what I do here.
[109:15.04]Jedi doesn't mean I can use a giant military anti-air gun.
[109:21.06]Where did the Jedi go?
[109:22.80]Check the main weapons on the side of the ship.
[109:28.92]Good shit?
[109:29.78]Is it?
[109:30.04]Ravenclaw.
[109:32.88]Oh, that's my house.
[109:54.08]Hopefully, come on, give me a break.
[110:07.59]Get me back at the Ravenclaw.
[110:11.13]Hufflepuff streamer.
[110:13.41]So?
[110:13.57]Is there going to be a problem with that?
[110:16.15]Where's this go?
[110:23.00]We already went over this.
[110:24.48]If you say you're a Slytherin, you're really a Hufflepuff.
[110:27.48]If you say you're a Hufflepuff, you're actually a Slytherin.
[110:31.68]Gryffindors are Ravenclaws.
[110:34.35]And Ravenclaws don't exist.
[110:48.47]There's like two in the story.
[110:54.48]I am a Ravenclaw.
[110:55.44]I'm House Ravenclaw.
[110:56.40]But who's a Ravenclaw in Harry Potter?
[110:59.94]Didn't spend any time on that house.
[111:13.02]We need some more Ravenclaws in that story.
[111:15.80]Gryffindor.
[111:16.36]Gryffindor.
[111:16.88]Gryffindor.
[111:17.40]Gryffindor.
[111:17.88]Slytherin.
[111:18.38]Slytherin.
[111:18.82]Slytherin.
[111:19.28]Slytherin.
[111:19.86]Slytherin.
[111:20.28]Look at that snake.
[111:21.14]Slytherin.
[111:23.46]Where are the claws?
[111:24.35]Did I go down here?
[111:28.25]I'm not even going to give you the satisfaction of seeing that because I knew I was going to fall.
[111:38.71]House of White Claw.
[111:42.27]Can you imagine the shit face dude sitting there at the Halloween party, right?
[111:48.45]And he's drinking White Claw and he's got like the Harry Potter costume on.
[111:52.81]Hey, House White Claw.
[111:57.01]Yeah, alright.
[111:58.51]Dave, we heard it already.
[111:59.59]Hey, did you know that I'm in House White Claw?
[112:03.93]Yes, we did.
[112:04.69]And his glasses are broken.
[112:06.29]He's got like, there's no lenses in him.
[112:07.50]They're like tilted.
[112:10.65]Hey, do you know, have you seen my wand?
[112:12.79]Yeah, that was expensive.
[112:14.66]I got that thing made at Disney World.
[112:18.04]It was like 200 bucks.
[112:19.94]I love that thing.
[112:21.06]House White Claw.
[112:26.02]Hey, we don't know where your fucking wand is.
[112:27.54]Why would you bring an expensive wand to a Halloween party?
[112:32.47]You should have just got the one from the bag.
[112:35.73]It's made out of plastic.

[113:19.74]You like to drink red wine and like sit there and pretend like you're in the fucking Game of Thrones universe.
[113:27.03]Hey, what kind of wine is that?
[113:27.97]I don't know.
[113:29.83]It's red.
[113:30.87]What kind of red?
[113:31.39]I don't know.
[113:33.33]It's kind of like maroon looking.
[113:36.13]What kind of red wine is it?
[113:36.96]I don't know.
[113:39.08]How dare you drink that in front of me?
[113:48.24]Gatekeeping wine.
[113:49.64]Wine snob.
[113:50.54]I'm just kidding, obviously.
[113:52.52]I drink wine out of a box.
[113:54.00]You guys think I'm really serious?
[113:55.18]No, but really, people started drinking wine.
[113:57.12]Oh, and nobody, by the way, let's go over this.
[113:59.88]Nobody started drinking white wine after Game of Thrones, did they?
[114:20.24]Nope.
[114:20.90]The sales of white wine didn't go anywhere.
[114:22.46]It was red.
[114:22.96]They didn't drink white wine in Game of Thrones.
[114:33.04]It was just the big goblet with the red swirling around it.
[114:36.71]Oh, yes.
[114:37.27]Let's talk about medieval politics.
[114:39.79]Fuck Game of Thrones.
[114:49.60]I mean, like the last season of that show was terrible.
[114:53.77]I didn't drink enough wine and talk.
[114:56.47]That's the best part about that whole show.
[115:02.30]I didn't give a shit about the battles.
[115:03.84]Everyone's like, oh man, I can't wait for the next season where they're going to do another huge fucking Helm's Deep battle.
[115:08.18]I don't care.
[115:08.59]I want just Varys and Tyrion to drink wine and talk.
[115:12.85]That's what I wanted.
[115:14.29]I wanted the Queen of Thorns to just be in a conversation with Littlefinger.
[115:20.03]Wow, they just had big red wines.
[115:22.21]Comically sized.
[115:23.71]Like joke sized.
[115:25.42]And that's the whole show.
[115:31.38]But then we had to get the big fucking, like, big, like, Battlefront 2 battles.
[115:39.96]Anyways.

[115:44.02]I'm proud of it.
[115:45.72]Information to surface about a large stockpile of old weapons hidden in the waste of old mantle.
[115:52.03]Destroy the stockpile so they don't fall into the wrong hands.
[115:55.59]Records from the time of the rebellion indicate there should be seven caches hidden around this.
[115:59.05]This is going to be horrible.
[115:59.71]I can't wait to not... I don't want to do this.
[116:04.17]You're Hufflepuff.

[117:07.03]No, well, it must be good to be evil sometimes.
[117:13.15]I didn't even say the first part.
[117:14.59]Without evil, there could be no good.
[117:16.61]So it must be good to be evil sometimes.
[117:20.38]There.

[121:22.14]No.
[121:28.04]Where are they?
[121:28.50]They're not showing up on the 4th sense.
[121:31.62]Shouldn't they be showing up on 4th sense?
[121:40.74]Is that one?
[121:41.72]No.
[121:42.10]Where are they?
[121:51.56]Use the force map.

[124:06.01]He's not.
[124:06.21]I don't think he can die.
[124:12.64]He can't die.
[124:17.14]Wait, if I can fly up there and cut his head off.
[124:29.45]Force throw.
[124:33.13]Wait, hold on.
[124:44.09]He broke it.

[124:53.14]He broke it.
[124:53.92]He broke my lightsaber.
[124:55.18]No, where is it?
[124:55.74]Give me it.
[125:02.28]I can't do anything.

[125:24.66]Okay, that's what happened.
[125:39.13]Oh, boy.
[125:39.73]It was a T-pose.

[126:13.50]He's back.
[126:18.35]Oh, you fucking asshole.
[126:19.51]What are you doing?
[126:26.59]He's gone.
[126:32.12]I'm going to go this way.
[126:34.76]And then over here?
[126:35.56]Is there an entrance over here?
[126:44.38]Oh, this place sucks.
[126:54.28]I have to go that way, but there's no way to...
[127:04.19]It didn't look like a way I could go.
[127:10.19]Are you fucking kidding me?
[127:16.12]Actually, that helped me.
[127:16.98]I'm glad he did that.
[127:17.64]There's no door down here I can go through.
[127:22.72]I'm going to go this way.
[127:25.83]This way or this way?
[127:27.15]This way.
[127:44.95]Oh, I got it.
[127:45.61]Cool.
[127:48.23]Now there are... There's one more over... We'll go this way.
[127:53.80]Horse Pasta.
[127:55.20]He doesn't know I can see him.
[128:00.46]That move is so dumb.
[128:02.66]That move is dumb.
[128:04.86]It's so stupid.
[128:05.98]It instantly killed.
[128:07.14]Yeah, okay.
[128:08.50]I'm holding something in my hand that's hotter than that fire.
[128:22.13]Oh, now where the hell is he?
[128:32.77]What is this thing for?
[128:37.70]Oh, that's Death Star.
[128:40.40]Death Star.
[128:42.84]Right?
[128:43.02]Those are the plans for the Death Star.
[128:48.53]Okay, now that's three.
[128:50.03]We got a few more.
[128:51.11]Where are we going from here?
[128:51.89]Oh, fuck.
[128:53.33]Here he comes.
[128:58.40]That's factually incorrect.
[128:59.76]Well, they keep...
[129:04.86]I keep making them, so who cares?
[129:06.17]Alright, now fuck off.
[129:13.33]He's going to drop a bomb on me.
[129:14.55]I have to take him out.
[129:15.25]Now get out of here.
[129:18.98]Now get out of here.
[129:37.93]I don't see any more over this way.
[129:39.07]We got to go all the way on the other side.
[129:41.28]Other side, right?

[132:46.88]Jaden.
[132:47.38]Okay, right.
[132:51.90]What are you doing?
[132:52.58]That was the wrong way to run?
[132:57.22]His name's Melvin.
[133:10.54]I wish.
[133:12.68]I wish his name was Melvin so bad.
[133:23.50]Garth Melvin.
[133:24.34]Alright, straight ahead.
[133:37.03]Garth Melvin?
[133:47.23]Okay, there's only one more that remains and it is down there.
[133:52.83]Oh.
[133:56.31]A Mandalorian is here.
[133:57.61]What the?

[134:37.77]Melvin is a Mandalorian.
[134:39.77]Stop.
[134:40.73]Alright.
[134:40.95]Now what do I do?
[134:42.61]Return to the ship.
[134:44.87]Yes, he is.
[134:45.17]What are we talking about?
[134:47.37]What do you even?
[134:47.97]What is this nonsense?
[134:56.55]Mel Valorian.
[134:58.34]Oh, please.
[135:00.86]Where's that ship?
[135:07.59]Right in the middle somewhere.
[135:12.59]Where's my ship?
[135:13.45]Just leave me alone.
[135:14.25]I don't want to fight you anymore, Mandalorian.
[135:21.79]Leave me alone.
[135:28.61]No, that's bullshit.
[135:30.61]That's absolutely horseshit because I've played Star Wars Bounty Hunter.
[135:34.72]And the guy's like, hey, hey, Mando, right?
[135:36.90]Doesn't he say like, hey, Mandalorian?
[135:44.92]No, he says, hey, Jango, not Mandalorian, not Mando.
[135:48.07]Oh.
[135:50.23]It's outdated, though.
[135:51.01]Is it supposed to be Jango?
[135:57.33]Is it Jango?
[135:59.37]No, it's not.
[136:01.07]No, it isn't.
[136:03.07]It's Boba.
[136:18.38]Oh, I got him.
[136:19.06]He's under arrest.
[136:24.64]I'm sorry.
[136:25.00]I couldn't hear you over the sound of my lightsaber vacuum cleaner.
[136:27.72]What did you say?
[136:28.16]Not an enemy though.
[136:32.46]He chooses his own path.
[136:51.18]And thanks SodaCat for the 10 subs.
[136:55.08]Kyle and I have sensed great anger in you, Jaden.
[136:57.62]You must learn to control it or it could lead you to the dark side.
[137:02.83]I mean, very clearly all of my answers have been dark side.
[137:07.97]When they give you the Jedi personality test, I mean, if I get just S-I-T-H in Myers-Briggs, I'm pretty sure you should know by now.
[137:23.64]Okay, whatever.
[137:28.12]The time has come to put an end to the disciples of Ragnos.
[137:31.56]I believe that Tavion is storing force power in the scepter for one purpose.
[137:35.99]To resurrect Marco Ragnos.
[137:38.11]Is that possible?
[137:39.73]The force holds a great many secrets.
[137:42.13]It may be possible that if a high enough concentration of force energy is infused into a body, the cells might regenerate.
[137:49.51]Why is everybody calling me shitlord?
[137:51.85]What?
[137:53.17]What is shitlord?
[137:54.71]Shitlord?
[137:55.01]Shitlord?
[137:55.29]Shitlord Melvin?
[137:56.69]No, that can't be this guy.
[138:13.66]I don't know why that's making me laugh so much, but it is.
[138:38.39]It's not that funny.
[138:39.37]I know, but it is, though.
[138:40.97]Like, I don't know why it's doing it.
[138:42.57]Alright, here we go.
[138:42.99]Gain entrance into the cult facility on TASPR-3 to search for Rosh Pennon.
[139:12.03]Here we are.
[139:14.15]The enemy base.
[139:18.27]I'll go in the back way.
[139:19.65]If we enter from both sides, we're bound to find him.
[139:24.87]I have to pee.
[139:27.29]Yeah, I'm going pee.
[139:28.59]I'll be back.
[139:29.65]See you guys in like 2-3 minutes.

[141:41.18]At least I like this one a lot.
[141:44.16]Oh, no.
[141:57.46]Versus Otto?
[141:58.24]Oh, no.
[142:04.84]Alright, let's go.
[142:09.28]Otto wins.
[142:11.60]Fatality.
[142:15.88]Alright, so here we go.
[142:16.66]Gain access to the imperial power facility.
[142:21.86]By jumping, twisting and spinning.
[142:33.29]Oh my God, this is heavily guarded.
[142:36.39]But it's not a big deal.
[142:54.31]It's a good link this time.
[142:55.53]We haven't seen one link at all the whole day.
[142:59.11]Let's see what this is.
[142:59.89]Alright.
[143:00.25]I'll take a second.
[143:00.81]This is the first link.
[143:05.66]But that, it has to be red, doesn't it?
[143:07.12]Shouldn't this be red?
[143:12.74]Oh wait, that's, I get, okay, hold on a minute.
[143:20.51]Wrong image.
[143:31.86]No, but it needs to, it needs to be red.
[143:39.79]This one also, please.
[143:40.95]Alright, hold on.
[143:41.57]I'm going to look.
[143:43.76]No, that one's stupid.
[143:46.06]No.
[143:47.52]Change the color.
[143:48.24]You can't.
[143:49.00]It's not allowed.
[143:53.34]What are you guys doing?
[143:54.32]I'm not avoiding these links.
[143:55.66]Where the hell are you linking me?
[144:00.59]Alright, I'm playing.
[144:01.29]Let's go.
[144:02.59]Yes, you can.
[144:05.51]Alright, I swear to God, if this is fake... You know what, BRB for a sec.
[144:08.97]If this is fake, I'm gonna be pissed.
[144:14.10]Give me a sec.
[144:18.84]I don't want you to see it.
[144:19.68]I want to reveal that it's fake.
[144:27.28]What's the command?
[144:32.22]Shit, there's a fucking stormtrooper trying to kill me.
[144:44.19]Okay.
[144:45.05]Color.
[144:45.63]Red.
[144:49.21]Red.
[144:52.45]It doesn't do anything.
[144:54.06]It's a lie.
[144:55.68]It's a lie.
[144:56.66]It's a complete lie.
[145:03.30]Look.
[145:05.95]You tell me what I did wrong.
[145:18.33]No parentheses.
[145:26.23]Did you enable SV cheats?
[145:27.87]I did.
[145:29.71]No quotes.
[145:32.47]Saber color.

[145:52.64]It broke.
[145:59.68]It broke.
[146:00.10]It broke in half.
[146:11.15]I thought you guys were just lying to me.
[146:13.39]I kept seeing the debate face.
[146:17.04]Saber three red.
[146:20.22]Saber color three red.
[146:23.64]Oh, I just made him bigger and lighter.
[146:29.59]Wait.
[146:35.13]Can it be any color?
[146:39.19]No, I can't have like the dark saber.
[146:46.47]Okay.
[146:50.65]I want one red and one black.
[146:57.60]I'm a Sith Lord and I have the dark saber.
[147:01.12]It's a really weird way to.
[147:07.71]Wait, what did I just?
[147:08.79]I just turned my shit green.
[147:14.65]It's like a spray paint house.
[147:15.71]Why did this turn green?
[147:27.59]What?
[147:33.37]Oh my fucking god, I didn't save it once.
[147:46.06]Valid colors.
[147:46.68]I'm gonna see.

[148:29.62]Color.
[148:30.30]One.
[148:30.70]Red.
[148:31.28]Red.
[148:35.98]There is no three.
[148:36.82]Alright, well I got it.
[148:37.44]Should I be Christmas Sith?
[148:59.77]Merry Christmas, Lord Melvin.
[149:06.85]Do Sith Lords celebrate holidays?
[149:08.71]I feel like they probably still do.
[149:16.23]You can't celebrate Christmas just because you're evil?
[149:32.33]That just kind of hurts my eyes.
[149:42.05]I'm going back to double red.
[149:54.44]Any other weird cheats?
[149:55.56]Saber, color, two, red.
[150:01.68]Saber color one red.
[150:04.08]I quit.
[150:07.76]Saber color one red red.
[150:10.98]Saber color one red red.
[150:14.40]No, you fucking idiot.
[150:24.43]Don't put a space.
[150:26.53]No space between red?
[150:31.50]Like that?
[150:33.42]It's turned blue.
[150:42.98]Beat Saber.
[150:54.01]Between saber and color.
[150:57.25]There's no brown.
[151:04.47]Connect them?
[151:05.67]I can't connect them.
[151:06.61]I can just hold it like this.
[151:07.57]I almost fucking died.
[151:11.87]Alright, what's the mission here?
[151:14.19]Gain access to the facility.
[151:15.44]Okay, let's go.
[151:16.04]What are you supposed to do about that, by the way?
[151:48.63]Kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill!
[152:14.63]Half off you're dead if you do this next mission without dying or do the Macarena if you fail it.
[152:21.27]No.
[152:23.45]Absolutely not.
[152:24.21]100% no.
[152:41.45]That's, this is such a good link.
[152:42.91]Alright, we'll just wait a minute.
[152:48.19]One guy, community chest.
[152:49.81]One guy in your favor, remove 500 million from the debt.
[152:54.85]Wait, I got a community chest?
[153:04.81]Nice!

[153:12.99]One guy in your favor.
[153:13.99]Remove 500 million from the debt.
[153:15.59]Nice!
[153:20.64]That's a good pull.
[153:26.64]I'll take it.
[153:32.72]Alright, we're gonna go all the way up.
[153:38.14]No, no more deals.
[153:38.78]Not yet.
[153:39.12]I'm trying to be a Sith Lord.
[153:51.88]Okay, here we are.
[153:55.12]Force choke this guy.
[153:56.21]And then force pull him.
[153:58.41]And snap his neck.
[153:59.97]And then electrocute all of them at the same time.
[154:01.61]Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.
[154:03.49]Electrocution.
[154:09.14]Where's that bridge?
[154:18.90]A billion off the debt if you ban links.
[154:20.88]You're not going to get everybody on board on that one.
[154:22.49]That's not happening.
[154:24.49]You really think you're going to get people on board on that one?
[154:26.75]Nope.
[154:31.95]There it is.
[154:32.35]I mean... I had to do that.
[154:45.31]Is this Hands Up?
[154:47.59]Why was he in Hands Up?
[154:50.70]Yeah, I'm not even a Sith Lord.
[154:56.46]I'm just adding these to my collection.
[155:04.75]Everybody agrees with that.
[155:05.75]Maybe I'll think about that then.
[155:14.13]Maybe I'll think about that.
[155:15.49]But hey, lose the attitude.
[155:28.11]I love that saying.
[155:29.21]Yeah, yeah.
[155:30.20]That's a really good idea.
[155:31.12]I really appreciate that.
[155:32.30]That's good.

[170:41.71]Hold on.
[170:42.11]I need somebody that has animations for swinging a lightsaber.
[171:01.02]That was to have a lightsaber swing animation.
[171:03.43]I'm going to take your word for it.
[171:07.41]I'm going to save it right here.

[172:08.26]Do I stare like this in cutscenes too?
[172:17.57]I'm afraid to save.
[172:18.73]I did it.
[172:29.96]It's over.
[172:30.22]Where did that guy even come from?
[172:41.72]Let's go.
[172:42.60]Jawasith.
[172:58.50]I can always revert the player model.
[172:59.90]That's true.
[173:00.41]Here we go.
[173:05.01]Let me take the head off.
[173:11.73]Uh-oh.
[173:12.81]No, I'm light now.

[173:59.66]Red lightning?
[174:03.03]Use melee, you can grab people.
[174:09.95]Uh, the Jawa doesn't have a melee.
[174:25.37]I know Kung Fu.
[174:26.35]I know Kung Fu.
[174:32.51]What?
[174:34.82]But I don't have a lightsaber anymore.

[174:40.54]What was that?
[174:46.11]What was that?
[174:52.71]I really am just the mini emperor.

[177:00.52]How are we doing today?
[177:03.10]Coming to check and see if you have any skill in the name of the Force.
[177:09.00]Have we found the Jedi scum that has been walking around aimlessly?
[177:15.76]Commander, no.
[177:16.50]We have not found the Jedi yet.
[177:18.28]Jedi has not been found.
[177:19.34]We are doing our best to find him.
[177:22.00]I think you can do more than that than simply looking.
[177:27.70]Have you... Have you tried looking inside of yourself?
[177:33.43]Commander Green!
[177:37.69]You will find those Jedi and you will bring them to me.
[177:40.92]I want them alive!

[179:22.13]Can't.
[179:22.53]It crashed.
[179:24.11]Not going to happen, unfortunately.

[181:03.12]Okay, I need a second.
[181:08.74]Hold on.
[181:12.41]Run away.
[181:13.11]Run away for a second.
[181:14.01]Hold on.
[181:32.28]I need to fix the player model.
[181:36.71]Alright.
[181:42.35]I can't do force moves with Chewie.
[181:44.63]I can't heal.
[181:54.57]I need to just get out of this area for a second.
[182:01.35]Chewie sucks.
[182:02.87]Chewie sucks.
[182:03.71]Chewie's terrible.
[182:05.33]He's terrible.
[182:11.44]I'm not even doing any damage.
[182:12.90]Okay, hold on.
[182:17.26]I can't even force heal.
[182:21.44]Does this prove that Chewie is not force sensitive?
[182:26.09]Oh my god.
[182:49.25]Fuck, I can't go in here.
[182:50.47]Okay, Chewie's done.
[182:57.87]Chewie can't do anything.
[182:59.78]Chewie's terrible.
[183:00.76]He's awful.
[183:01.40]He can't even do any force powers.
[183:12.01]I can't even stop.
[183:13.73]Why is he doing... He can't do force powers.
[183:21.67]He can't do anything.
[183:24.82]Just hide.
[183:25.36]I need to change my player model.
[183:32.59]Boba Fett.

[199:07.11]I took it from a copy pasta.
[199:08.57]Oh, well, what the fuck?
[199:12.18]Player model, um... I think we did it all.
[199:21.02]Cultist Saber Strong.

[200:50.95]Darth rocks.
[201:04.16]Oh, I just ruined everything.
[201:09.77]Am I going to get to see one of the final cutscenes as rocks?
[201:15.79]Well, we made it across.
[201:24.19]You can't kill me.
[201:25.97]I'm floating above you.
[201:44.11]Unkillable rock.

[202:03.25]Oh, shit.
[202:03.87]No, he's gone.
[202:06.56]Are the rocks talking?
[202:09.20]You can't stop me.
[202:11.58]I can't let you do that.
[202:12.86]He's back!
[202:31.27]We believe you can't stop me.
[202:34.76]following is going to be encouragement for me not for you because I'm unstoppable can I use the lightsaber oh seth rock
[203:13.42]This is so stupid.
[203:15.46]This is the dumbest thing ever.
[203:28.85]Beat the game like this?
[203:31.91]I mean, I'm gonna save it before the fight.
[203:36.20]Oh my god, that guy got carved up like a turkey.
[203:53.85]Oh!
[203:59.38]I feel like I'm... Am I progressing?
[204:06.42]Is this game progress?
[204:07.80]I have no idea what's happening.
[204:09.12]Do I have to go up again?
[204:46.44]Where do I go?
[204:47.07]Am I going the right way?
[204:49.39]I feel like this is like a boss.
[204:51.25]This looks like a boss fight.
[204:52.65]Who's this?
[204:59.99]Oh, that guy.
[205:01.63]I feel like this is an important character.
[205:10.42]Oh, shit.
[205:15.42]I'm alive.
[205:15.84]I'm alive.
[205:16.71]Rocks can't die.
[205:17.55]I forgot.
[205:18.59]Rocks can't die.
[205:20.05]I'm unkillable.
[205:42.95]It was up here, right?
[206:06.36]Other way?
[206:07.12]I'm so turned around.
[206:08.32]I have no idea what's going on.
[206:11.57]I have absolutely no idea what's happening.
[206:16.19]This is just cheating.
[206:17.28]Alright, alright, alright.
[206:18.80]Going back to Jawa.
[206:25.30]And that's how we're gonna do it.
[206:43.44]Go back to the rocks for the ending.
[206:44.80]Player modeled Darksaber.
[206:54.65]Am I even going the right way?
[206:58.31]I have no fucking clue.
[207:01.57]Over there?
[207:01.99]I think it's over there.
[207:04.89]Oh, well, we'll just kill these guys.
[207:17.56]Yeah, it's this way.
[207:18.20]Alright, here we go.
[207:24.32]Oh, shit.
[207:24.77]Is this the... No, we're not the Jawa.
[207:34.79]It doesn't work in cutscenes.
[207:41.60]Fun's over.
[207:43.66]Bitty bitty.
[207:44.40]Bitty bitty.
[208:03.57]Forgetting your Jedi training.
[208:05.75]Look, Allura, why serve Tavion?
[208:08.77]It's not too late to join us and fight her.
[208:13.67]I'm taking Rosh out of here.
[208:15.57]Make it easy on yourself and tell me where he is.
[208:18.17]Oh, he's around.
[208:20.83]I think I'll go look for him.
[208:32.73]Oh, no.
[208:41.82]Oh, no.
[208:43.00]She's got me locked with her Jedi powers, her Jedi cement body.
[208:48.90]Ah, you fiend.
[208:52.90]Villain.
[208:55.10]I'll get out of this soon, don't you worry.
[208:56.58]I'm good.
[209:14.28]I thought that was an X-Wing.
[209:15.24]I was like, that's not an X-Wing.
[209:18.37]It spawned somewhere.
[209:21.02]Where that is...
[209:45.15]How do you get out?
[209:58.23]Oh, no.
[210:00.86]It's okay.
[210:01.36]It's alright.
[210:01.70]We're gonna get this back.
[210:11.21]Okay, I think I've hacked the game.
[210:14.03]By the way, I can no longer walk, but I can jump.
[210:19.49]This is not good.
[210:30.35]Player model drone.
[210:31.29]Oh, shit.
[210:35.12]I think it's actually completely fucked up.
[210:38.80]No, no, no.
[210:39.52]No, we gotta go back and change back.
[210:45.99]Was it default?
[210:51.47]Who is it?
[210:52.69]What's this guy's name?
[210:53.41]Jaden?
[210:59.62]How come he can't find Jaden?
[211:01.86]He's the main character.
[211:14.27]Okay, there we go.
[211:16.79]That's changed.
[211:17.25]Let's get this right.
[211:27.10]What's that one for dual saber?
[211:33.05]What is it again?
[211:34.53]Saber dual one.
[211:44.79]The wrong button!
[211:57.44]It says quick load!
[211:59.42]Fuck you, Jeremy!
[212:00.86]Come on!
[212:02.42]Why?
[212:02.92]Am I small?
[212:11.69]Wait, I'm... Hold on, this is not right.
[212:16.99]This is inaccurate.
[212:19.18]This is not accurate.
[212:20.96]Something's wrong.
[212:27.20]Say player model.
[212:29.12]Player.
[212:30.20]Give me back my player.
[212:34.52]Saber dual one.
[212:37.54]Okay.
[212:38.62]Saber color one.
[212:41.02]Red.
[212:41.64]Red.
[212:43.60]Why am I tiny?
[212:44.46]He still is small in the cutscene.
[212:56.96]What?
[213:09.79]I don't care.
[213:12.53]Alright, let's go.
[213:15.12]Objective update.
[213:15.92]Find Rosh.
[213:22.34]I don't have any powers.
[213:25.26]My lightning is gone.
[213:30.38]I don't know why.
[213:30.94]I have 200 force power.
[213:42.85]Itty bitty ooey gooey.
[213:44.67]I just reload the game.
[213:47.39]You use force- set force all.
[213:58.45]Set force all four.
[214:00.87]Here we go.
[214:04.03]Thank you.
[214:04.25]They didn't see me?
[214:16.66]Uh, touch the computer?
[214:20.14]Why am I locked in here?
[214:27.19]Oh, shit.
[214:27.69]Boss room.
[214:29.17]Boss room.
[214:29.97]Save it.
[214:30.29]Yeah, I'm going to go against Tavian.
[214:45.91]Where?
[214:47.63]Watch it.
[214:47.91]Watch it.
[214:48.17]Watch it.
[214:48.45]Watch it.
[214:48.87]Come on.
[214:49.43]Get him.
[214:54.79]Sith versus Sith.
[214:55.59]I think I've actually grown.
[214:56.63]I'm back to normal.
[214:58.49]Fuck you.
[215:05.30]Oh my god, what have I done?
[215:06.52]Thank god you can't save the game while dead.
[215:19.99]How up?
[215:26.91]Get away from me.
[215:27.49]Alright, we're good.
[215:31.93]Ultimate power.
[215:32.91]Okay, now we're going to go just pick a door.
[215:35.25]How about this one?
[215:42.89]Saving the game quick.
[215:56.90]I'm weak.
[216:02.99]What do you think about that?
[216:08.71]Use electricity in the water for extra damage.
[216:11.20]That makes sense, doesn't it?
[216:14.62]No, it doesn't.
[216:18.64]Turn the fucking lightsaber on.
[216:19.76]Why don't you turn it off?
[216:38.20]Why do I keep turning the blade off?
[216:43.85]It's saving power.
[216:44.91]No, it's just... It's... It's not smart.
[216:49.27]It's very stupid.
[216:50.13]I still have melee.
[217:03.30]A lightsaber would boil the water.
[217:07.95]I don't know how lightsabers supposed to work.
[217:11.71]It's just heat, right?
[217:12.89]It's so hot that it burns through flesh and bone instantly.
[217:15.75]That's kind of how it works, right?
[217:24.85]They don't.
[217:26.03]It's a saber of light.
[217:27.56]Yeah, that'd be hot.
[217:28.70]Who's that?
[217:50.82]Both dead?
[217:56.56]Yes, they are.
[217:57.92]Save it.
[217:59.60]Time for the final confrontation between who Tavian was Rosh the entire time.
[218:04.16]No, I mean Tavian.
[218:08.14]Rosh was Tavian the entire time.
[218:10.32]Wait, that's the same thing.
[218:11.09]I just said it again a different way.
[218:17.21]There's a big, big bad, right?
[218:19.73]That they're working for.
[218:21.83]Rosh is the big bad.
[218:32.36]Nice.
[218:38.00]No, I'm not a Jedi.
[218:40.46]Look at my saber.
[218:41.14]We both have the same one.
[218:45.48]And by the way, those of you that don't know, to get a red lightsaber, it's about punishing and making the crystal submit to you, right?
[218:55.80]Remember that.
[218:57.01]I'm reading the lore somewhere.
[218:57.97]Ah!
[219:13.63]He was lying.
[219:14.07]He knew all along.
[219:14.85]Of course I fucking knew.
[219:15.85]I'm a huge fan of Star Wars.
[219:17.01]Nice try, but I dodged it.
[219:25.11]Oh, fuck.
[219:27.21]Let go, let go, let go, let go.
[219:28.27]Get me out.
[219:30.69]Where the fuck did these stormtroopers come from?
[219:32.15]Let go of me.
[219:40.57]That's so stupid.
[219:41.81]So unfair.
[219:43.23]Unfair.
[219:44.61]Unfair.
[219:45.21]Get me out.
[219:51.91]Not very much fanfare for that guy's death.
[220:01.77]Took his blade too.
[220:03.11]Sick.
[220:11.59]oh shit I was scared for no reason alright force push while choking somebody I'll try it I didn't I didn't do anything force push is terrible
[220:41.39]Force push when being choked.
[220:46.45]While you are choked.
[220:50.13]Okay.
[220:57.03]Uh, what am I doing here?
[221:00.17]Oh my god.
[221:00.67]Why haven't I had the bottom part?
[221:02.69]There's no point to have the bottom part.
[221:04.41]Why is it in here?
[221:05.51]Dev.
[221:05.79]Dev.
[221:16.48]Oh, come on.
[221:24.99]I'm going to activate it when it does this.
[221:29.37]Here we go.
[221:29.79]Ready?
[221:30.23]Three, two, one.
[221:31.77]Fucking horrible.
[221:39.84]I made it.
[221:52.32]Okay, so we gotta go down.
[221:55.08]Sure.
[221:58.74]Wait till we get to... Made it down.
[222:06.80]Where are you?
[222:17.08]Okay.
[222:23.17]what if that's her alright now I can turn this goddamn machine off I guess not can't touch this
[222:54.05]Okay, can't touch that either.
[222:55.03]What's the goal here?
[223:08.40]Only people can subscribe to Jerma985 and touch that.
[223:17.05]Oh, fuck.
[223:17.51]I'm... Yeah, dead.
[223:26.14]Sub only door.
[223:30.75]Keep going.
[223:32.23]Whoa!
[223:37.89]Kyber crystal.
[223:41.46]The way to get a good kyber crystal is you gotta make sure you... You have to mine it yourself, right?
[223:49.32]The crystal has to... What just happened?
[223:51.34]What just happened?
[223:53.32]What's going on?
[224:06.67]Yeah, you have to mine the crystal yourself.
[224:08.01]I think, right?
[224:19.80]It's whatever crystal calls to you or something.
[224:23.91]I know.
[224:24.23]I know how this thing works.
[224:33.61]It's electrified.
[224:37.76]I feel like I'm dying in this game more than I'm dying in Dark Souls.
[224:42.87]I didn't touch anything.
[224:49.81]It's fucking electrocuting me.
[224:58.72]What the fuck?
[225:03.50]When do I get to go?
[225:04.36]So there's electricity there.
[225:08.50]It smashes and then you can go in.
[225:11.10]Smash!
[225:11.52]Alright, I fucking did it.
[225:47.50]Now what?
[225:49.15]Oh, fuck.
[225:49.93]Okay, hold on.
[225:51.09]What?
[226:14.66]go go go hurry up hurry up open up too fast for you okay save it keep moving I'm almost at the final encounter in jedi master perhaps you too will learn to serve tavion
[226:57.58]Maybe I will... Tavion's going to be Darth Vader.
[227:00.86]Or Emperor or something.
[227:08.25]I wasn't paying any attention at all.
[227:09.59]When does this game take place?
[227:12.55]In between what saga?
[227:14.45]Luke looks pretty young.
[227:15.61]So I'm going to assume, I mean, Luke doesn't look old or anything.
[227:21.32]After episode 6.
[227:24.32]10 years after Return of the Jedi.
[227:25.90]Okay.
[227:26.02]Okay.
[227:27.23]Yeah, because he doesn't look old or anything.
[227:29.19]So this is between the sequel series.
[227:31.37]Cool.
[227:31.77]Alright.
[227:38.78]Okay, I get it.
[227:54.48]None of this is canon anymore.
[227:57.44]It's not.
[228:03.74]None of it.
[228:06.71]Oh, I found you.
[228:10.65]Take me back to the Academy.
[228:11.89]I need help.
[228:23.49]Okay.
[228:23.59]Good.
[228:23.71]That hurt.
[228:23.91]That apparently hurt real bad.
[228:27.19]Oh fuck, I am the bad guy.
[228:29.01]Look at me.
[228:52.54]do I know you won't betray me again you're always trying to beat me how do I know this isn't just another trick jay don't do it what finish him jedi wait listen to what you're saying you're you're angry don't give into it that leads to the dark side right you see the saver I'm holding dude
[229:20.53]he only fell to the dark side because he was scared afraid of dying put away your saber strike him down give in to your anger I need a new apprentice don't give in to your anger rosh is telling the truth angel and demon on the shoulders who do I listen to deactivate your lightsaber remain on the pad I don't even know what it said
[229:50.08]Don't do it!
[229:50.54]Oh my god, he's gonna do it!
[230:09.88]Well done, Jedi.
[230:11.64]You have become one of us.
[230:13.16]No, no, excuse me.
[230:14.42]Excuse me.
[230:15.76]I'm my own person.
[230:17.86]We will defeat the Jedi and rule the galaxy.
[230:20.20]No, you get down.
[230:20.70]You're next.
[230:22.32]Why should I trade one master for another?
[230:25.48]The scepter of Ragnos is too powerful to be left in the hands of someone as weak as Tavion.
[230:31.22]If anything, it should belong to me.
[230:33.16]Of course it should.
[230:33.80]Oh, you think so.
[230:36.46]You, on the other hand, are useless.
[230:39.88]How has he?
[230:40.18]Oh, fuck.
[231:09.65]No, no, no, no.
[231:10.11]I don't want to do that either.
[231:10.99]Let's go.
[231:34.03]Wait, what?
[231:34.81]That was it?
[231:35.97]I just fucking slaughtered her.
[231:38.29]She's two pieces.
[231:39.97]She can't even do her ending dialogue.
[231:41.51]Does she have dialogue at the end?
[231:43.97]Oh my god, I'm so powerful.
[231:51.84]Isn't this supposed to be a big boss battle?
[232:03.76]No, he didn't pass the Jedi bar exam.
[232:09.08]He was a para-Jedi.
[232:10.00]The game just blew up.
[232:39.58]Okay, well, I guess we're gonna open it again.
[232:42.38]Good point.
[232:59.26]This is it, right?
[233:11.90]Okay, here I am.
[233:12.64]Uh oh.
[233:12.80]I'm a bad guy now.
[233:13.60]That's right.
[233:13.96]I've got force lightning.
[233:41.64]The path of the Sith.
[233:44.40]Oh, fuck off.
[233:49.10]He turns and he's like, no.
[233:50.88]The scepter will be mine.
[233:53.12]And this guy over here with the mask on stabs him through the chest.
[233:56.32]It's my scepter.
[233:59.06]This is lazy, right?
[234:00.00]Like, can we have another reason why a villain would become a villain?
[234:02.86]It's like a big greedy artifact item.
[234:08.37]The only thing that we can do to make people like evil.
[234:14.16]Oh, that powerful art of... Wait, what?
[234:16.16]Is it a different person?
[234:18.34]It's a different NPC.
[234:18.96]Don't just instantly kill me.
[234:43.04]He killed her.
[234:44.28]No, that artifact is going to be mine.
[234:47.32]I will kill anybody that's in my way to get that artifact.
[234:51.26]No, it's my artifact.
[235:01.53]Oh, wait, somebody else looking for an artifact.
[235:04.11]Well, sorry, it's mine.
[235:06.65]Oh, fuck you.
[235:08.94]Did I save it?
[235:09.44]When did I save it?
[235:12.42]What did I save it?
[235:13.60]Did I save it here?
[235:23.05]Okay, let's go.
[235:24.63]Save it right here.
[235:25.39]Enough of this bullshit.
[235:34.05]And by the way, what do you even do with that item?
[235:38.64]What, the double-bladed lightsaber is not enough for you?
[235:53.52]Who the fuck is this?
[235:57.30]It's mine!
[235:57.93]The scepter will be mine!
[236:05.49]Dude, I heard that scepter was unguarded right now.
[236:11.15]Did you just say money?
[236:12.89]Power?
[236:14.07]Fashion?
[236:18.47]What are you doing here?
[236:20.49]Same reason you're here.
[236:21.23]Is that a stupid question?
[236:37.62]Alright, I was going to say we could split it.
[236:46.53]How do I get out of this room?
[236:48.39]I don't know.
[236:48.77]Maybe I go like this.
[236:49.45]Put my fingers at my temples and go... I don't know.
[237:05.34]It's like a weird puzzle or something.
[237:15.79]Line up the diamonds.
[237:18.79]Are diamonds lined up?
[237:26.09]What happened?
[237:27.55]Nice job.
[237:41.67]It's a war.
[237:42.65]Seth versus Jedi versus me.
[238:01.32]Oh, okay.
[238:01.76]We got two Jedi.
[238:04.20]Gone.
[238:05.32]Cool saber combo though.
[238:06.54]I like it.
[238:09.18]One big orange.
[238:10.52]I like that too.
[238:11.02]What do you say?
[238:32.28]Opportunist.
[238:32.88]Yeah, fuck you.
[238:33.80]Get out of here.
[238:39.14]Do a mind trick.
[238:40.54]It's not even bound.
[238:43.06]Force powers.
[238:45.38]Mind trick.
[238:46.22]I don't know.
[238:49.52]Tea?
[238:50.64]No, it's drain.
[238:51.56]Whatever.
[238:51.80]I don't care.
[238:52.24]Tea.
[238:52.60]This is made my screen brighter.
[238:53.74]What?
[239:08.19]Just healing.
[239:08.63]Okay.
[239:13.89]Okay, T. Wait.
[239:22.73]That's so stupid.
[239:31.43]Alright, mine trick.
[239:35.31]How far does this go?
[239:41.99]How long can I control this person?
[239:43.46]I'm trying to burn him.
[240:04.00]Can I kill him?
[240:18.87]Alright, so the music just played.
[240:19.89]Oh shit!
[240:34.12]Okay, that's pretty funny.
[240:58.90]Where am I supposed to go?
[240:59.82]Wait, what happened?
[241:02.14]Down?
[241:02.44]I have no idea what I'm doing.
[241:07.80]Did I mind float?
[241:08.62]Okay, here and then into this room over here.
[241:19.63]New objective.
[241:21.59]Find a way to open the door to the valley.
[241:30.72]It's got a big triangle on it.
[241:31.98]Oh, okay.
[241:32.36]Look at this.
[241:32.78]It goes the end of the game puzzle.
[241:46.43]I'm going to assume it's the one that's the triangle.
[241:59.95]Oh my God.
[242:00.57]Is that it?
[242:08.59]That's good.
[242:08.93]That's triangle.
[242:09.53]Triangle and this one.

[243:38.58]This is, uh... They're killing each other.

[243:47.57]Get on in here.
[243:48.17]Oh, fucking please.
[243:58.38]Don't run!

[246:54.62]Okay, I'm done.
[246:55.60]I'm done.
[246:56.68]This is a fun game.
[246:57.90]This is very fun.
[246:58.72]I'm not going to push that forward anymore.
[247:01.72]It's too stupid.
[247:02.82]I can't even say it.
[247:06.67]Force protection or force pregnant.
[247:19.55]Get me the fuck up here.
[247:20.46]I got to get out of this game.
[247:31.16]Why did you do that?
[247:33.16]Why did you do that?
[247:38.79]What?
[247:41.11]Wait, he kicked me.

[247:56.48]What happened?
[247:58.46]Okay.
[248:03.21]Are you not?
[248:10.49]You are not a Jedi.
[248:11.49]Why would you say that?
[248:18.27]It's me.
[248:30.38]Oh, I lost it.
[248:41.42]Okay, continue.
[248:45.68]It's me, a Jedi.
[248:47.22]That's right.
[248:48.06]I think we're going down.
[248:49.80]Power up!
[248:56.50]Power up!
[249:05.39]Nice job, dude.
[249:11.64]Wait, we're almost at the temple.
[249:13.46]We're almost at the temple.
[249:14.20]This guy sucks.
[249:40.63]Nice move, but it doesn't matter.
[249:42.21]I will give you an honorable death.
[250:00.86]Two on one.
[250:01.46]Let's see if this guy can do it.
[250:05.08]No, no, that's unfair.
[250:07.40]Well, he's still alive.
[250:11.72]He's still alive!
[250:16.94]Holy shit, he's doing so good!
[250:18.36]Nice work.
[250:37.55]Thanks for clearing everything out for me.
[250:44.14]Like I fell out from the ceiling, I think.
[250:45.67]Whatever.
[250:50.25]Whoa!
[250:57.61]Who's attacking me?
[251:00.83]Who's shooting me?
[251:01.88]This game is a bit right.
[251:10.16]Something's going on with the FOV in the game.
[251:12.36]Something's messed up here.
[251:15.07]Force bit rate.
[251:16.11]What?
[251:16.29]Did this drop bad?
[251:33.75]Nice.
[251:34.33]Good job.
[251:35.59]Behind you, behind you, behind you, behind you.
[251:47.06]Tried to warn him.
[251:52.92]How many people are down here?
[251:56.15]There are way too many people here.
[251:57.67]There's so many people here.
[251:58.51]This is just a dumb amount of people.
[252:00.45]Alright.
[252:04.85]Falling down into the lava in three, two, one.
[252:11.20]Unfortunate.
[252:17.16]Falling into lava in three, two, one.
[252:25.26]Come on.
[252:27.69]Falling into the lava in three, two, one.
[252:30.93]Get over here.
[252:32.31]You won't get far.
[252:53.94]Okay, well, it still happened.
[252:56.04]Not the way that I wanted, but it still did.
[253:02.52]Here.
[253:04.36]Jump, jump, jump!
[253:04.93]Come back.
[253:16.77]Come back.
[253:30.42]Okay, now kill him.
[253:34.89]How do I get out?
[253:38.57]How do I get out of this guy?
[253:39.65]Get out.
[253:42.71]Okay, I'm just gonna just die.
[253:47.18]Lava?
[253:47.64]No, hold on.
[253:49.20]I'll just force pull him out.
[254:02.88]Lots of Jedi.
[254:13.80]You move around so quickly.
[254:14.96]Stop.
[254:16.38]It's burning.
[254:21.90]This guy's a Loose Cannon.
[254:23.39]I got to get rid of this guy.
[254:24.71]I had to get rid of that guy.
[254:29.85]That guy was just could not be around from any longer.
[254:38.66]Oh, this game is something else.
[254:41.38]I'll tell you.
[254:41.88]This is something else.
[254:50.91]So where's Tavian?
[254:53.44]Tavian's going to end up being Kyle or something, right?
[254:56.46]It's going to be something stupid like that.
[255:07.23]Is the reason why you guys are saying that this game is not canon is because is it Luke?
[255:13.18]Is Luke at the end be like, that's right, I'm Tavian and this is not canon.
[255:26.87]Wait, do I have to go all the way back?
[255:31.29]Oh, fucking my god.
[255:32.49]I hate that.
[255:33.05]At least give me a second after I die because I'm clicking to swing the sword.
[255:37.87]Oh.
[256:03.81]Okay, alright, alright.
[256:04.91]Force push!
[256:06.71]Alright, I gotta run.
[256:07.43]Fucking come on!
[256:11.23]I'm about to turn on god mode and just run to the end of the game.
[256:27.14]Manitoba.
[256:46.88]You know what?
[256:47.32]Just all of you come back here to the lava.
[256:49.02]You're all so stupid.
[256:50.34]You're just gonna walk in it anyways.
[256:52.24]Why even have a Jedi fight when you're just gonna walk in the lava and die?
[256:56.79]There's no point in having this fight.
[257:06.63]Where are they?
[257:11.15]Get out, get out, get out!
[257:16.25]Who's that punching?
[257:18.33]Why was my character punching?
[257:25.86]Quick, quick, get in there quick.
[257:32.36]Come here.
[257:44.05]Fucking die!
[257:58.76]He's in lava!
[257:59.42]Are you kidding me?
[258:12.59]What?
[258:14.64]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[258:15.56]I don't know.
[258:15.98]Just run.
[258:19.08]What's wrong with me?
[258:19.78]Alright, we're good.
[258:30.76]All the way back to the beginning.
[258:34.38]Wait, wrong way.
[258:35.06]Can I go the other way?
[258:55.88]I don't know why that scared me so much.
[258:57.34]Hey, but away from him.
[259:10.30]Hey, away from him.
[259:10.86]Don't touch him.
[259:26.14]Okay, so can I get there from here?
[259:36.07]Is there where to go?

[264:35.29]Just don't even go that way.
[264:36.59]It's not even worth going that way.
[264:39.35]Just go up here.
[264:40.18]Oh, fucking come on.
[264:43.06]Oh, you have to remove the force skin.
[264:49.78]Yeah.
[264:56.35]I can't make that.

[267:55.34]This is dumb.
[267:56.02]I'm not doing it.

[268:13.39]Where is he?
[268:15.45]Oh!
[268:24.31]No, don't fall in!
[268:35.57]I'm waiting for him to fall in behind me.
[268:38.21]I spawned him in the worst place.
[268:46.34]Okay, that's it.
[268:48.93]I'm done.
[268:49.85]Time to play the game.
[269:21.38]Can I go around?
[269:22.28]Is this the wrong way?
[269:23.87]I'm just trying to hop the other way.
[269:54.26]Alright, let me just leave.
[269:55.00]Let me look.
[269:55.44]I have to go this way, but how do I even get over there?
[270:03.01]I guess I could.
[270:13.65]You walk.
[270:16.41]I mean, I. Can I get up here?
[270:26.65]No, there's another big pit here.
[270:27.65]The way I was going the first time.
[270:29.65]Yeah, but there's a huge pit here.
[270:30.94]This is wrong, isn't it?
[270:32.14]I can jump like I did before?
[270:43.26]Oh, okay.
[270:48.82]I jumped it.
[270:49.30]Yeah, I know, but I'm supposed to be over there?
[270:51.02]It didn't look like I could open that door.
[271:06.77]Can I make it?
[271:07.23]Can I make this jump here?
[271:09.91]I definitely have to go this way, so alright.
[271:38.58]Okay.
[271:40.80]Can't open that.
[271:41.48]Can I get on top of this?
[271:44.94]Can I knock this down?
[271:45.68]Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[271:48.86]Are you kidding me?
[271:49.62]Are you absolutely kidding me?
[272:03.17]Sonic Adventure 2.
[272:04.45]Yeah.
[272:10.54]Alright, let's go.
[272:11.24]Come on.
[272:22.21]Do the same thing?
[272:23.13]Pull it, right?
[272:24.01]No?
[272:24.17]I don't... Oh, I don't die if I go down here.
[272:47.73]That didn't work.
[272:57.85]Is a door down here?
[273:00.36]What?
[273:01.06]What the fuck is this?
[273:02.38]Why is this here?
[273:17.35]Alright, I'm in the center of the mountain here.
[273:20.55]This has got to be close.
[273:38.85]Roger that.
[273:39.69]Roger that.
[273:41.81]Imagine a fall joke.
[274:00.53]It just took a little longer than usual.
[274:02.17]It just took a little bit longer, but we got it.
[274:04.33]Oh, here we go.
[274:17.70]One on one on one on one.
[274:20.50]One on one on one on one.
[274:24.28]Oh no, it's 3v1.
[274:25.06]I had it wrong.
[274:33.05]Free for all!
[274:40.67]Hey!
[274:50.42]Hey!
[274:55.84]Green versus red.
[274:56.96]Good versus evil.
[274:58.18]I don't know what happened.
[275:00.96]Evil, leave or lose.
[275:07.47]You know what?
[275:20.29]My fucking god.
[275:22.65]I am holding it together here.
[275:34.23]I'm just going in the temple.
[275:35.34]Who cares?
[275:40.64]Is that guy going to stand a chance?
[275:42.12]I'm just going to the temple.
[275:54.39]I don't care.
[275:55.03]Get me in.
[275:55.99]Open the door.
[275:57.11]Open the temple door.
[275:58.11]Open the door.
[276:07.58]No, you motherfucker!
[276:13.78]Well, I don't even need to go in there.
[276:15.12]That's a... Who's...
[276:39.70]Oh, stop Tavion from resurrecting Marka Ragnos.
[276:45.60]I will.
[276:47.60]And I'm going to take the crown.
[276:48.52]Oh, hi, guys.
[276:53.23]Alright, well, bye.
[277:24.41]Checkpoint.
[277:25.03]There he is.
[277:32.30]The Scepter of Orange Light.
[277:36.58]Oh, this is Tavion.
[277:38.80]Right.
[277:39.00]I forgot from the very beginning of the game.
[277:41.16]I did not.
[277:41.66]I forgot this person existed.
[277:43.76]Am I hiding behind the door?
[277:46.64]No, I want to... I want to rule the galaxy.
[278:07.90]I will have the scepter and its power for myself.
[278:11.56]Now, give it to me!
[278:13.14]Impudent whelp.
[278:15.48]I will enjoy slaying you.
[278:17.48]Captain's little brat.
[278:22.33]Ugh.
[278:22.47]Ugh.
[278:51.82]It keeps wiggling off of it.
[278:55.16]Did I win?
[279:05.34]Come here.
[279:05.84]Get over here.
[279:16.49]I'm going to do this dumb shit.
[279:17.57]I don't care.
[279:28.63]Gotta get it in the exact right spot.
[279:55.26]That looks good.
[280:03.83]I can't do that man.
[280:07.32]We're gonna be fire Andy.
[280:13.64]I can't believe that fucking work.
[280:24.06]I want to like spawn the X-wing in there.
[280:35.54]Did we fight Ragnos?
[280:36.92]Oh, it's way too late.
[280:41.20]It already did.
[281:05.07]You walked into the end of the movie, dude.
[281:07.17]No.
[281:54.22]Oh, I didn't kill him.
[282:00.55]What's wrong?
[282:06.39]Why is his head pulsating?
[282:07.29]His head's getting bigger.
[282:08.93]What's happening to his character?
[282:12.40]What's happening to him?
[282:13.76]He's mutating.
[282:37.65]I can't even do this.
[282:43.58]Oh my god.
[282:44.48]He didn't even say anything.
[282:45.70]We didn't get to talk.
[282:46.96]What am I doing?
[282:48.02]Don't just point it at random shit.
[282:55.67]Now you show up, Luke.
[282:56.47]What happened here?
[282:58.51]Jaden has turned to the dark side.
[283:01.13]And he's taken the scepter.
[283:02.47]And Rosh?
[283:03.31]Dead.
[283:04.39]Are you alive?
[283:04.89]Isn't that the most powerful item in the universe?
[283:07.80]Yeah, his head would be like a crushed watermelon.
[283:27.54]We lost a lot more than students, Luke.
[283:30.26]He's killing everyone, and he has the most powerful scepter on Earth.
[283:33.70]You may be right.
[283:34.40]It's gonna have to be you, Luke.
[283:36.42]Well, at least Tavion and her cult have been stopped.
[283:39.70]Ragnos won't be coming back.
[283:41.88]But the scepter is too powerful.
[283:43.74]We must find Jaden and destroy it.
[283:45.80]I'll take care of it.
[283:47.28]As my student, Jaden is my responsibility.
[283:50.20]I'm taking a leave of absence from the Academy for a while.
[283:53.34]If I find Jaden, I'll let you know.
[283:57.30]Yeah.
[283:58.11]Show up 45 minutes ago, Luke.
[284:04.25]Before he killed 400 people.
[284:06.89]And took everything.
[284:08.69]And almost killed me.
[284:10.37]You just walked in.
[284:12.73]Didn't get my texts.
[284:14.75]Now you have read receipts on.
[284:15.75]I saw you saw it at fucking exactly 3.55 PM.
[284:17.55]It said, help for the love of God.
[284:21.71]He's killing everyone.
[284:23.07]And here you are at 4.50.
[284:23.83]Interesting.
[284:37.01]Why is our guy lying down on the ground?
[284:38.25]That's it?
[284:56.84]Wait, didn't they just say Luke was going to come find me?
[285:09.35]Is it DLC or a second game or something?
[285:12.01]Is there a sequel?
[285:18.81]It was just... There is.
[285:21.75]Is there a Jedi Academy 2?
[285:23.46]Or is it just Jedi Knight?
[285:27.16]There's a ton of these games in there.
[285:28.48]Hmm.
[285:41.09]Jedi Knight 2, Jedi Outcast.
[285:43.43]Hmm.
[285:44.49]Okay.
[285:45.71]Are they as fun as this one was?
[285:49.17]Or did you guys want me to play this one?
[285:50.37]Because this is the fun one.
[285:55.09]This is the good one, right?
[285:56.20]This is like the fun, interesting one.
[285:59.60]Right.
[285:59.86]Okay.
[286:06.26]Outcast is good.
[286:07.30]Outcast is the better one.
[286:08.34]Hmm.
[286:08.46]Is there any after credits things?
[286:22.18]Chewbacca is himself.
[286:24.28]What?
[286:28.66]This is not a Marvel movie.
[286:33.65]Whatever.
[286:35.77]Alright.
[286:37.25]I think that's a good place to stop.
[286:42.19]You chose this ending.
[286:43.03]You could get the good ending.
[286:44.53]Well, actually, no.
[286:44.93]I'm going to spawn the Rancor in this room.
[286:46.85]Is there nothing else after this?
[286:48.07]I do want to spawn the Rancor inside the boss room.
[286:56.31]Play KOTOR.
[286:57.59]I feel like KOTOR is probably a little too slow for me.
[287:02.46]It's a lot of dialogue, isn't it?
[287:03.74]A lot of dialogue choices.
[287:05.20]I think it's a little too slow.
[287:07.28]I know it's an incredible game, but I don't know if I want to stream it.
[287:10.38]It might be a little too slow for me on stream.
[287:13.99]KOTOR is like 30 hours.
[287:15.07]Yeah, I don't know.
[287:20.83]Okay.
[287:21.59]Spawn Rancor.
[287:48.85]Okay, I need to hide for a second.
[287:50.81]Wait, I can just do this, right?
[287:53.21]Okay.
[288:02.60]Where is it?
[288:07.22]Where's the rancor?
[288:15.26]Move Jaden.
[288:22.18]Okay, I have to hide her.
[288:24.43]Whoa!
[288:28.31]No, no, no.
[288:28.65]Fight each other.
[288:29.21]Here we go.
[288:34.71]Did he grab her?
[288:39.18]Please eat her.
[288:39.96]Eat her, please.
[288:44.52]Wait, he's still in the cutscene.
[288:46.50]He's still in the cutscene.
[288:48.29]Who is he attacking?
[288:50.11]It's... Wait, he's blocking...
[289:14.60]He ate him.
[289:19.82]He ate him.
[289:21.51]He fucking ate him.
[289:22.87]I need a second.
[289:30.53]Then stop me, master.
[289:47.41]Oh my god.
[289:49.79]There's nobody here.
[289:57.52]He's gone.
[289:58.06]They're both gone.
[289:59.24]He ate them both.
[290:05.82]Okay, what happens if I hit enter?
[290:07.00]Oh, the game's about to crash hard.
[290:10.07]Yeah, the game's crashed.
[290:14.62]It's so stupid.
[290:17.10]You can hear him screaming.
[290:19.28]The first reaction is not, why is there a Rancor in this room?
[290:32.44]No, he just gets fucking swiped.
[290:37.31]He's just fucking screaming.
[290:43.18]Okay, that's it.
[290:44.78]I'll see you guys on Friday.
[290:49.06]Ugh.
[290:50.73]Yeah, to the third cutscene so he eats Luke.
[290:52.79]I can't.
[290:53.19]That's not going to happen.
[290:53.97]He's going to kill everybody in the room.
[290:58.25]That's not going to... I don't think we... I'll try.
[291:04.74]I'll try.
[291:05.56]Fuck my chest.
[291:09.64]I'll try it.
[291:10.28]I promise I'll try once.
[291:14.78]Okay, so can I spawn in the cutscene?
[291:18.48]Spawn him during the Kyle fight.
[291:21.46]Okay.
[291:22.24]I get you.
[291:22.68]I get you.
[291:23.04]Okay.
[291:26.67]That's a good idea.
[291:27.55]That's a really good idea.
[291:28.53]That was so easy.
[291:30.75]Okay, here we go.
[291:31.33]Here comes the Kyle fight.
[291:33.43]Okay, here we go.
[291:34.01]Let's spawn him.
[291:36.27]If this motherfucker eats Luke, I'm gonna shit my pants.
[291:47.01]Did I get it?
[291:51.31]Oh, fuck you.
[292:01.14]Oh my God.
[292:02.00]You just put me into the menu.
[292:11.29]Press up arrow.
[292:14.79]Oh shit.
[292:15.23]Okay.
[292:24.99]Here we go.
[292:27.89]Okay, here we go.
[292:29.89]Let's see if he eats Luke.
[292:36.54]I gotta get in a good spot.
[292:39.54]Why is this so easy?
[292:40.30]Yeah, this is just really fucking easy.
[292:46.95]Get out of the menu!
[292:50.01]Where is he?
[292:53.25]Don't kill me, fuck!
[293:10.25]Okay, stay away from me.
[293:12.17]Wait, why is he doing that?
[293:14.09]What?
[293:14.81]Wait, what the hell was that?
[293:16.81]He doesn't do that.
[293:17.58]I gotta restart the game.
[293:24.28]He's doing the force choke?
[293:31.94]Turn on god mode.
[293:35.43]Okay, alright, alright.
[293:36.23]Hold on.
[293:51.19]Okay, I might actually be able to get this.
[293:53.85]I'm going to right here.
[293:59.36]Okay, and let's get him spawned in three, two.
[294:06.84]Oh, fuck.
[294:08.14]Okay, what's god mode?
[294:13.98]Okay, here we go.
[294:17.58]Actually, I don't want god mode.
[294:18.66]I wouldn't be able to die in the cutscene.
[294:21.10]NPC spawn mutant rancor.
[294:26.88]Okay.
[294:27.94]We've got it.
[294:29.28]It's time for me to lose control of this and I'm going to leave.
[294:34.35]So how do I pull out of this?
[294:41.01]I have to move.
[294:41.65]Okay, here we go.
[294:47.28]Ow.
[294:48.36]You got him.
[294:48.74]Okay, you got him.
[294:49.16]You got him.
[294:49.46]He's going to eat him.
[294:51.36]This is it.
[294:52.12]We're finally going to get to see it.
[294:56.85]Okay, here we go.
[295:00.33]Come on.
[295:00.69]We need Luke.
[295:01.33]We need Luke right now.
[295:05.41]Come on in, Luke.
[295:10.99]Luke?
[295:12.72]Where's the Rancor?
[295:26.55]Kyle, what happened here?
[295:29.26]I don't think he's there anymore.
[295:30.25]Oh, he is.
[295:30.51]Come on.
[295:30.75]No.
[295:30.85]His face is rough.
[295:31.73]That would have been perfect if he swiped.
[295:33.29]No.
[295:57.92]It needs to be in a better spot.
[295:59.12]I know.
[295:59.70]Fuck.
[296:00.14]Alright, hold on.
[296:01.26]Wait, wait, wait.
[296:01.68]We're gonna try again.
[296:03.46]Oh, my fucking head's gonna hurt.
[296:05.76]That side.
[296:06.90]Big wide shot, man.
[296:10.26]That big wide angle.
[296:11.24]If he gets swiped out of that fucking cutscene.
[296:14.33]Spawn him right in the middle.
[296:15.19]Okay, hold on.
[296:15.75]Let me get in a good spot.
[296:18.49]We need to spawn him right in the center.
[296:20.37]Right here.
[296:20.85]Like, right here.
[296:25.31]Spawn more than one.
[296:26.35]Dude.
[296:27.13]Dude.
[296:32.00]I'm gonna fucking die.
[296:33.86]Okay, right here is where I want him to spawn.
[296:42.14]Right there.
[296:42.50]I have to run immediately forward.
[297:13.08]Jesus.
[297:17.48]Oh, my God.
[297:18.24]Why are they all red?
[297:19.12]Why are they red?
[297:21.98]Oh, hold on.
[297:22.63]Okay, come on.
[297:23.07]No, no, no.
[297:23.49]Don't kill me.

[297:25.57]Jump, jump, jump.
[297:26.91]What am I doing?
[297:27.67]Did they get him?
[297:32.37]They got him.
[297:32.79]Somebody got him.
[297:39.56]Kill him.

[298:38.32]Somebody-
[298:54.73]Wait, I want to see it one more time.
[298:56.23]I have to see it just one final time.
[298:59.63]One more time, okay?
[299:00.59]And then I'm done.
[299:08.09]Just one.
[299:08.56]I have to see Luke get grabbed from that wide angle.
[299:12.90]It's the only thing I care about.
[299:13.98]I don't care about anything else on Earth.
[299:20.56]I spawned a bunch of Lukes?
[299:22.06]No.
[299:31.67]No, don't get me.
[299:34.77]Let me go.
[299:35.09]Let me go.
[299:35.39]Let me go.

[299:51.95]Good.
[299:52.53]Here we go.
[299:52.91]He's stepping on me.
[299:58.19]No!
[299:59.27]I missed.
[300:06.78]Does Luke still come?
[300:09.02]Does Luke still walk into frame?
[300:10.46]He's going to say that there's nobody under the rocks.
[300:22.82]What happened here, Kyle?
[300:25.12]Wait, wait, wait, come on, give us the wide angle.
[300:27.60]Give us the wide angle, please.
[300:29.26]Please give us the wide angle.
[300:35.09]No!
[300:45.74]He's so close.
[300:47.76]No, Kyle.
[300:48.80]Yoda and Ben were both great teachers.
[300:50.42]He needs to be like a hair forward.
[300:55.76]What was that?
[300:56.34]There's always hope, Kyle.
[300:58.61]Remember that.
[300:59.23]The scepter is too powerful.
[301:09.81]We must find Jaden.
[301:20.77]Okay, I'm done.
[301:21.47]I have to stop.
[301:22.19]I'm done.
[301:23.05]Stream's over.
[301:31.96]Wait.
[301:32.64]Is the Rancor still in?
[301:33.62]Is he in the ship?
[301:36.16]What?
[301:36.38]Wait, the Rancor's in the ship.
[301:40.21]That's not possible, right?
[301:43.69]Impossible.
[302:09.45]Oh, Jesus.
[302:13.49]Okay.
[302:14.09]Well, that's enough of that.
[302:16.93]I'll see you guys on Friday.
[302:18.91]That's the end of the stream.
[302:20.75]I'm going to do a bunch of stuff.
[302:24.05]Oh, man.
[302:28.07]That was a very fun game.
[302:29.61]I'm glad I played it.
[302:36.39]Yeah, I will see you guys very soon on Friday.
[302:40.32]Thanks for watching everybody.
[302:42.56]We'll see you soon.
[302:43.08]We're going to do the little credits here.
[302:45.73]Jedi Academy was awesome.
[302:46.75]I might play the other ones too.
[302:48.69]Not KOTOR though.
[302:51.49]Oh my goodness.
[302:52.91]My whole body hurts.
[302:59.67]I got a workout today.
[303:00.87]That's good.
[303:04.81]Pause that.
[303:07.92]Thank you again, everybody.
[303:08.98]Here come all the subs that were today.
[303:10.18]We had a shitload of community subs.
[303:13.90]Thanks a lot, guys.
[303:19.36]Oh, man.
[303:19.92]Oh, man.
[303:23.40]What about The Force Unleashed?
[303:24.90]I never played either one of them.
[303:32.93]The first one's better than the second one, though, right?
[303:39.82]I'm going to have to take a shower after this one.
[303:41.30]Play Fallen Order.
[303:50.04]I'm going to give a look at all the Star Wars games.
[303:52.11]I'm going to give a look.
[303:55.07]Make sure I take a good, close, microscopic view.
[304:00.65]Whew.
[304:07.82]You should play Jedi Outcast 2.
[304:09.00]It's such a good game.
[304:10.99]I missed all these.
[304:11.77]I didn't play any of them.
[304:14.51]We will check out at least one or two more, I promise.
[304:16.23]Play Battlefront?
[304:23.33]Maybe we'll do another Star Wars week or something.
[304:30.79]When are you going to do the awards encore?
[304:33.61]That's a good question.
[304:35.33]Probably the end of January.
[304:41.39]Late January is probably when we're going to do the little encore awards.
[304:44.33]Because I want to do a new poll and do a new voting and everything.
[304:46.65]Because they were not on the poll.
[304:51.77]And it probably won't take that long.
[304:52.87]We can just kind of add it to the end of a stream or the beginning of a stream too.
[304:59.32]But have a wonderful week, guys.
[305:00.44]I will see you on Friday.
[305:02.50]Probably around 3 o'clock Pacific on Friday.
[305:09.47]Take care of yourselves.
[305:10.83]Have a great night.
[305:13.23]And I'll be back with some things to talk about.
[305:17.62]See you real soon.
[305:19.08]Have a great week.
[305:20.84]Good night, guys.
[306:06.33]Thank you.
