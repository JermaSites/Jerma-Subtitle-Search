[ve:60.16.100]

[01:12.66]Hello.
[01:13.66]How's it going?
[01:16.23]How's it going?
[01:19.55]You're saying you're late?
[01:20.83]Yeah.
[01:23.21]Let's clear the record here, though.
[01:27.36]Well, let's clear my throat first, and then we'll get into that.
[01:30.88]I was gonna stream on Friday.
[01:33.06]But I got the... I got the day wrong.
[01:36.80]So I pulled it back to Thursday.
[01:39.83]And then I decided, you know what?
[01:41.31]No.
[01:42.19]I'm pulling it back again.
[01:42.97]We're going on Wednesday.
[01:46.61]And here we are.
[01:47.23]I said I was gonna be around 3.
[01:49.05]It's a little after 3.
[01:50.23]But I reverse delayed, reverse delayed.
[01:52.87]Into a small minor delay.
[01:54.35]I think that's fair.
[02:00.04]That's fair.
[02:04.25]You said Friday.
[02:06.51]Yeah, well, whatever.
[02:07.59]I'm here now.
[02:09.49]And it ain't Friday.
[02:12.13]I know.
[02:12.47]That's fine.
[02:16.14]That's fine.
[02:20.48]That's a skewed concept of fair?
[02:24.98]Well, instead of having to wait two full days, you only had to wait 35 minutes.
[02:32.99]That's fair.
[02:38.85]bro stop your schedule has given me trust issues well I guess the let me ask a question is there a um then be honest with me be very honest with me I because I've been thinking about this for a while and and drop some names I'd love to hear them I'm curious do you know of a streamer
[03:06.30]that is on time 90% of the time.
[03:11.46]Like a streamer that's like, okay, guys, you know, Thursday, I think I'm going to start streaming around like two.
[03:19.07]Who is always on time?
[03:22.07]No matter what, they're always on time.
[03:27.07]I feel like most streamers are like 10 to 20 minute late Andes, all of us.
[03:39.26]You're literally the only one.
[03:44.33]I'm not.
[03:44.71]There's no way.
[03:52.83]I'm definitely not the only one that's 10 plus minutes.
[03:55.87]And I have a defense, though.
[03:59.44]I don't have a starting soon screen.
[04:01.72]I do, but my starting soon screen means...
[04:05.88]that I'm here right now.
[04:08.84]And the starting soon screen is at most maybe 60 seconds before I start talking.
[04:14.71]Maybe a minute total.
[04:16.85]I don't have a starting soon that lasts 10 plus 20 plus minutes.
[04:20.65]That is copium, but it's... I think that's good copium.
[04:24.37]I think that's good copium.
[04:27.05]You are a lying prick.
[04:30.73]Hey!
[04:35.95]damn geez no no let's hear about he has a point yeah that's what I'm talking about we got the founders coming in yeah we got the founders coming in when are you gonna do a Bugleberry mukbang yeah that should be kind of funny it's wicked fucking gross shit
[05:06.84]It's just like, no, it's just weird.
[05:08.92]It's just weird food items.
[05:21.81]When's Otto's Adventure Remake?
[05:23.35]When are you going to do the beach episode for your channel?
[05:30.24]The beach episode?
[05:35.71]That's so funny.
[05:38.18]Damn.
[05:38.64]That's a good one.
[05:41.60]That's such a good one to just do a sitcom level beach episode, but it's just a regular stream and it's only, and it's, it's 22 minutes long.
[05:56.30]I should just do an entire, an entire tournament arc until I ruin the channel and nobody watches.
[06:06.29]You know what I mean?
[06:06.85]Like, I should have a, like, three-month-long tournament arc where you know I'm gonna win.
[06:14.54]You know I'm going to win the tournament.
[06:18.00]And you have to watch, like, 70 other people lose before I just win it.
[06:26.06]And there's a ton of drama every time I get up there.
[06:29.35]But there's no way I lose.
[06:32.69]I'm just not going to in the end.
[06:34.61]You know it.
[06:36.43]You know that at some point, I will be in the finals.
[06:46.18]No matter what happens.
[06:50.15]End it with a time skip.
[06:53.25]Yeah.
[06:55.41]Holly, end it with a time skip.
[06:56.95]That, oh my god, that's so... There's one thing I will promise you.
[07:05.56]There will be a point.
[07:07.92]There will be a point where I just, I'm just gonna do whatever the fuck I want here.
[07:13.10]And like, it's gonna be detrimental to the channel.
[07:15.89]You know what I'm saying?
[07:16.83]Like, it's gonna happen eventually, where it's just like, whatever.
[07:20.19]I'm gonna do a fucking month-long Terminark and then do a time skip and just ruin the whole channel.
[07:26.09]You know what I mean?
[07:26.99]Like, who cares?
[07:28.73]At some point, let's just do it for fun.
[07:30.39]Who cares?
[07:31.19]You do this already?
[07:33.47]Right now, he says.
[07:34.59]Right now, he says.
[07:35.27]Huh.
[07:41.47]You do this now.
[07:42.47]Well, whatever.
[07:47.89]That's fun to me.
[07:48.69]There's also other things that I really want to just do that I think would just be fun to do.
[07:54.73]I want to say this so bad, but somebody will steal it and I can't have this stolen.
[08:01.45]This is going to be so funny.
[08:03.90]And I know, oh my God, he's saying his own material is funny.
[08:07.80]No, this is the funniest thing I've ever seen.
[08:10.84]I've ever heard of.
[08:11.98]No, that's a lie.
[08:12.64]That's actually like egomania.
[08:15.44]But I don't want anyone to know this idea because I really do think you're going to steal it.
[08:22.27]Oh, it's the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.
[08:23.79]I'm gonna puke blood.
[08:26.70]I gotta dial it back a little.
[08:30.77]I gotta like dial it down a little bit here.
[08:35.24]What if it's not fun?
[08:36.02]Yeah, that's the thing.
[08:36.80]That's also too true.
[08:39.22]A lot of times when I have an idea for something, I don't usually talk about it at all.
[08:44.06]Because in the event that I get to the stage where I actually really am doing it and I go, this sucks.
[08:48.46]This is awful.
[08:50.22]Then you didn't know about it and it wasn't funny.
[08:53.20]You guys are only seeing the things that I really thought were going to make it to that point that were really interesting.
[08:59.31]Lots of other stuff has fallen through that you did not hear of, that you did not see.
[09:07.78]We need our show failed idea stream.
[09:09.66]There's a lot.
[09:14.15]There's a lot of, you know, there's also things too that I think would be really, really interesting for 10 seconds.
[09:20.87]And the problem with hiring a production crew and spending a bunch of money on what amounts to 15 seconds, a lot of times does not turn out to be worth doing, which kind of sucks because there's a lot of like 30 second material that I would love for you to see.
[09:38.89]But eventually it's just like, okay, that was, oh my God, that was, I loved that.
[09:43.91]Alright, that's all I had to say today.
[09:47.97]These would be explosive on YouTube short TikTok.
[09:50.89]Oh yeah.
[09:55.15]Just move, just do TikToks.
[09:58.09]No.
[10:01.21]Upload it to YouTube then.
[10:08.99]Do a variety show.
[10:12.77]But long story short, I know we're playing Devil May Cry, but... I love the little micro jokes.
[10:22.64]They work so much for me.
[10:30.11]Depends.
[10:30.45]But yeah.
[10:34.29]How did we even get on that?
[10:35.33]I don't even know.
[10:36.45]Why did I start talking about that?
[10:41.96]Alright, TL;DR.
[10:42.86]Uh... I wish I had a hundred million dollars.
[10:48.34]Because I would just... I would do one of these every day.
[10:51.59]That's it, but unfortunately I don't have that.
[10:55.83]I would be... It would be probably really... It probably would be too much, though.
[11:02.92]You do.
[11:03.96]I do not.
[11:05.64]I do... No, I do not.
[11:15.71]You don't have a billion- No, I don't.
[11:18.62]Sorry to say.
[11:20.92]Play the game already.
[11:23.12]I get my 10 to 15 minutes before starting a video game.
[11:28.56]This is time for me to tell you about my day.
[11:34.08]And then I will shut up and move on to the game.
[11:36.10]But this is my 10 minutes here.
[11:37.74]I get the floor.
[11:40.28]I get the floor before I wheel in the TV for us to watch.
[11:43.70]In school here.
[11:44.24]Okay?
[11:44.70]Okay?
[11:49.25]It's been 20 minutes.
[11:49.99]It has been 12 minutes total.
[11:55.05]Come on.
[11:56.53]Alright, let's go.
[12:02.78]Silence insolent viewers.
[12:05.94]Yeah, true.
[12:13.91]Does it ever scare you how many people watch your streams?
[12:18.49]No.
[12:18.71]No.
[12:20.55]No, not really.
[12:23.85]I think that... Nah.
[12:30.66]We terrify him.
[12:32.68]What a terrifying thing.
[12:35.94]I have a question for all the Dante's Inferno enthusiasts out here.
[12:40.52]Should I just play on easy and just grind souls?
[12:48.19]Is that an easy way just to get some extra money?
[12:53.05]Why are you doing that voice again?
[12:54.75]What voice?
[12:55.19]I'm not doing a voice.
[12:59.45]I'm not doing a voice.
[13:01.21]I just talk sometimes in different inflections when I'm talking about different things.
[13:07.01]Just go?
[13:07.59]Stay on normal?
[13:10.87]You have milk voice again?
[13:11.89]I do not have milk voice.
[13:13.67]I know what it is.
[13:14.23]I know what it feels like.
[13:21.64]Is this too loud?
[13:25.46]Hard to tell over here.
[13:26.12]Okay.
[13:27.50]Oh, no.
[13:27.74]We saw this, didn't we?
[13:28.72]We'll watch it again.
[13:29.54]It's fine.
[13:29.74]Turn up the volume?
[13:30.40]I will.
[14:00.43]We can't hear shit.
[14:01.65]I'll turn it up.
[14:02.77]Hold on.
[14:03.19]Imagine being in a movie theater and the movie is like 10% volume.
[14:11.43]How long is it going to take before somebody says that?
[14:13.83]Hey, we can't hear shit.
[14:16.12]Turn it up.
[14:16.94]What the fuck?
[14:19.82]Five minutes?
[14:20.86]What do you think?
[14:26.70]10 minutes?
[14:29.47]It would probably take at least 5 minutes.
[14:39.09]Now that would be really funny if for some reason the volume was turned way down in a theater and that, what was that old was it THX?
[14:48.48]That sound effect.
[14:51.26]Imagine that played at like 5% volume.
[14:53.08]It would not hit hard at all.
[14:54.28]It would be kind of funny actually.
[14:57.76]Is there an audio delay?
[15:00.00]I don't think so.
[15:03.23]Do you know what I think is the most important thing in any piece of media?
[15:06.79]I mean this with my deepest heart.
[15:30.86]audio mixing is probably the most important thing.
[15:39.67]Having audio be correct in a movie with different levels of how they're talking and different sound effects and music, how loud, there is such a fine line between this music is a little louder versus the movie is ruined now.
[16:00.90]Fix the audio delay.
[16:01.92]I don't have... I don't see one.
[16:03.98]What?
[16:05.08]You are ruining it right now.
[16:06.96]I didn't do any... Look!
[16:10.06]There's no delay.
[16:10.94]There's no delay.
[16:17.02]I'm fine.
[16:20.94]The subtitles were ahead.
[16:26.05]It's very common in the... This person had a decent take.
[16:29.59]Let's see.
[16:32.00]It can carry the piece very far.
[16:33.54]It's very common in film and video industry that if you have a good sound person, you... Oh, yeah.
[16:39.10]Sound is... Even something you don't even think of, like when a bird flies by, if you're even hearing like a... When it flies by, very, very faintly, at like almost like not even 1 dB, like minus like 15 dB.
[16:54.94]That makes the whole scene...
[16:58.14]You ever seen something that has, like, big rock music behind it, and you take the music out, and it just looks weird, and just looks fucked up, and just like, what the hell am I watching?
[17:06.70]This looks stupid.
[17:09.88]Sometimes action sequences without something behind it, or really good sound and music mixing, it's kind of like, this, like, looks weird.
[17:17.45]I don't like, I'm watching a movie right now.
[17:22.13]Alright, let's go.
[17:25.99]It feels empty, yeah.
[17:32.44]I don't think I need to change anything.
[17:33.39]Let's just go.
[17:37.75]Okay, I had my delay.
[17:38.95]I had my stall.
[17:40.63]It amounted to 15 minutes.
[17:43.80]Okay.
[17:45.54]Everybody's going to scream at me.
[17:46.80]Ooh.
[17:52.22]The last thing I did was beat that intestine monster thing, whatever it was.
[18:04.66]Okay, now I'll turn the volume up.
[18:10.32]That should be good.
[18:10.98]Let me know if it's better.
[18:12.20]Should be where it was last night.
[18:17.12]Alright, I'm ready to play Dante's Inferno.
[18:21.30]Free order now.
[18:32.58]Use the new weapon?
[18:33.66]I will in like a few years.
[18:35.00]It's a weird place to be fighting.
[18:53.22]In a few in-game years.
[18:55.70]This works kind of like dog years.
[18:57.54]Every second that you and I are seeing is in their universe is about two months.
[19:04.89]You didn't know that?
[19:05.91]What did you think I was talking about?
[19:08.33]God damn it, man.
[19:23.46]This game takes place in one day?
[19:24.84]What?
[19:29.78]Have you seen the movie?
[19:31.82]Did you read the book?
[19:32.48]I mean, clearly not.
[19:48.29]Oh man, chill.
[19:49.83]I'm sorry, I just...
[19:53.00]But he said something.
[19:53.76]That was... Wait a moment.
[19:56.43]How am I supposed to respond to that?
[19:57.55]Okay.
[20:00.90]I'm in a fucked up mood today.
[20:02.06]I am.
[20:10.12]You can always tell when there's a reverse delay.
[20:11.92]This is a little bit of insider information for you.
[20:16.20]If I tell you that, oh, hey, reverse delay, I'm streaming today instead, you need to know that it's because, you know what, today I'm feeling, I feel like I am ready today, and I'm ready to go right now.
[20:26.83]I'm in one of those moods.
[20:31.15]Felt a little froggy.
[20:31.91]That's right.
[20:34.94]Sometimes you just don't, you're not in that mode.
[20:40.03]Alright, where am I supposed to go here?
[20:42.41]Down here?
[20:47.23]Can I not?
[20:50.23]Am I missing something?
[20:57.02]How long do you think you would spend in a bouncy castle?
[21:00.02]Uh, zero minutes.
[21:12.28]Wait, hold on, I... I didn't even see this!
[21:15.48]This is a whole nother way to go!
[21:16.68]I didn't even see it!
[21:19.55]No, I want the... Alright, if you want the real answer, fine.
[21:29.45]How long would I spend in a bouncy castle?
[21:34.98]Um, what do you guys think is the amount of time?
[21:38.26]that it would be, hey, there's an adult in the bouncy castle, and it's been more than X amount of time.
[21:52.93]Like, like, uh, hey, like, who's in the bouncy castle right now?
[21:57.17]Oh, nobody, just, uh, Uncle Frank is in there.
[22:00.09]Just, that's it, just Uncle Frank went in.
[22:01.53]Okay, alright.
[22:04.43]Alright, Uncle Frank is in there.
[22:06.51]How long is Uncle Frank allowed to be in there before the family kind of gets together and is like, Uncle Frank's been in there for more than X. I think it's probably five minutes.
[22:20.70]It's definitely five minutes.
[22:23.16]Two days?
[22:25.30]Uncle Frank is camping in the bouncy castle?
[22:38.61]Let him bounce.
[22:42.85]I need to get that item.
[22:46.32]Stop being politician, Andy.
[22:47.68]Just answer the goddamn question, coward.
[22:50.67]I am.
[22:52.85]Not every question.
[22:53.83]There needs to be context with this question.
[23:02.02]How long would... Okay.
[23:03.70]All context removed.
[23:05.56]If I... Okay, if a bouncy castle just teleported
[23:09.99]Behind me.
[23:10.49]And it was just there.
[23:11.23]Okay, how long do you want to be in there for?
[23:12.73]I would say ten minutes.
[23:14.45]There, I answered your question.
[23:16.61]Ten minutes.
[23:18.07]Total, maybe.
[23:18.87]And then it'd be like, okay, I don't want to be in here anymore.
[23:20.51]I'm done.
[23:20.75]Uh, it's got a new thing.
[23:28.49]What is that?
[23:30.75]Ooh, I got a new weapon, too.
[23:31.83]Let's try it.
[23:40.59]Dude, you're really going to stay in there five minutes more than Uncle Frank?
[23:42.99]Really?
[23:43.43]That's kind of not alright.
[23:45.91]Oh, God damn it.
[23:47.35]Yeah.
[23:52.93]How come he gets to stay in there?
[23:56.78]Yeah, you all yelled at me when I was in there for five minutes.
[23:59.20]You don't see how long Jeremy's been in there for?
[24:01.76]How come he gets to stay in there?
[24:09.86]Alright, well this is obviously the right thing, but how does this work?
[24:11.84]Okay.
[24:22.00]Tune up.
[24:23.82]Special stance used to link into certain combo attacks.
[24:26.34]Press Y while on the ground so that you switch the stance over.
[24:33.20]Keep the left stick neutral and press Y while in tune up mode.
[24:41.57]Devon is super complicated.
[24:42.93]You need to dump like 30k just for it to be functional and it's super hard to use.
[24:50.11]Why is it that every instrument item in every video game is always the coolest one, but it's always the most complicated?
[24:56.55]You need a PhD to use it one.
[25:03.41]It always feels like that, doesn't it?
[25:08.42]Still cool, though.
[25:08.90]What about the gun?
[25:10.34]What is this thing?
[25:14.16]normal shot oh just kind of like a cannon how does it work this thing might be good alright let me just use this enough to do this
[26:04.55]Yeah, alright, I got it.
[26:06.46]This seems kind of cool.
[26:12.48]I have no idea what he's doing.
[26:14.38]Oh, you have to have a certain power.
[26:15.62]I got it.
[26:19.84]I don't think I want to use it, though.
[26:20.94]It does seem a little complicated.
[26:23.64]It seems like you have to stand still a lot.
[26:24.78]Let's go back to those.
[26:31.71]Uh, yeah.
[26:34.84]Ooh, wait a minute.
[26:36.00]Should I... Somebody just rocked back in their chair and was like, Hurry the fuck up!
[26:45.05]Go, go on already!
[26:47.39]Please!
[26:53.67]No, no, just play!
[26:55.17]Please, God!
[26:57.84]So what, um, let me look at this.
[27:00.40]Hmm, I think this is probably kind of good, I think.
[27:03.28]I don't know.
[27:03.68]Hehehe.
[27:13.29]Yeah, we're going.
[27:14.19]I'm going, I swear.
[27:16.85]I'm going.
[27:17.37]Look, we're here.
[27:18.65]We're playing.
[27:22.61]God damn it, I can't stand it.
[27:32.28]And you just got a little too mad, didn't you?
[27:34.26]Mom just opened up the fucking door.
[27:36.20]Said, you're grounded.
[27:38.58]What?
[27:40.02]No!
[27:41.80]Fucking Jerma, get me grounded!
[27:43.98]Can't go over that I can't believe you got me grounded
[28:13.86]grounded before yeah who hasn't been grounded before okay oh he's a new I'm trying to think if my mother or father ever were like Jeremy you're grounded I don't I don't think so you're grounded
[28:42.90]Why, okay, what's happening right now?
[28:47.60]What are these protectors?
[28:48.46]Is that pretty much?
[28:53.01]Okay, it is, it is.
[28:54.91]Okay, these enemies are kind of annoying.
[29:10.98]What is my, what?
[29:13.74]I didn't even come close.
[29:24.68]The lock on circle is also the enemy health bar.
[29:26.66]It's really good to know.
[29:45.78]So what's game progress here?
[29:56.64]I was here last night already.
[30:16.86]by the camera angles, so scuff.
[30:19.48]Because this is a PS2 game.
[30:20.78]And it operates under the Mario 64 philosophy of you can tilt your camera just enough until the game hates you.
[30:28.61]Wait, oh, there we go.
[30:38.18]I can... Sometimes I can actually adjust the camera to go behind me, but it doesn't happen every time.
[30:42.52]Let me look at the map for a second, because...
[30:46.34]Where am I?
[30:48.89]Where am I actually supposed to be going?
[30:53.75]Because all the way down here is where I killed that lady was here.
[30:58.13]Right?
[30:59.53]So where to now?
[31:01.54]Just back to the main hallway and go in one of these doors in the middle.
[31:08.78]I guess just keep going.
[31:15.11]There's a map.
[31:16.02]There is a map, but I don't... There's two doors I haven't gone in, right?
[31:20.24]In the top left and top right of the circle here.
[31:26.90]He hates streaming.
[31:35.97]This game's classic.
[31:37.33]Yeah, I'm just going to go on this... Where do I end up in here?
[31:44.20]Okay, so now if I go up, I'll be back in that big room.
[31:49.54]Did you get ground for taking your whole PC into the bathroom?
[31:55.07]Um, no.
[31:55.45]Alright, where am I now?
[32:01.31]Okay, yep.
[32:04.15]Let's keep going.
[32:07.96]No, I didn't get grounded for that.
[32:24.38]Not gonna hit me.
[32:32.67]Ow.
[32:38.58]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[32:53.25]Everything just jumps away from you.
[33:10.38]I go to attack something and it leaps across the whole map.
[33:28.26]my god die already stop put the game on easy already hey I've made it to chapter 10 on normal in six hours I'm good
[33:57.87]I'm good.
[34:01.47]Okay, here we go.
[34:02.99]Special power?
[34:03.69]Oh, shit.
[34:05.92]I didn't get the special power?
[34:07.10]Did I really not get the special power?
[34:12.36]What would be under item?
[34:25.37]Stone mask?
[34:26.37]What is this?
[34:30.57]That's not it.
[34:32.11]So where does this go?
[34:35.93]Part rivers.
[34:38.83]Is there... I need to use that at a waterfall or something?
[34:49.19]That would make sense.
[34:56.39]Part water.
[35:04.89]From here, I'm gonna go up this way.
[35:08.32]That's where I need to go?
[35:15.84]Yes.
[35:20.70]Hear the water?
[35:21.34]There's water here.
[35:30.42]No, wait.
[35:31.32]Why am I... Really?
[35:33.16]I wish the indicator on the map showed where I was actually standing.
[35:37.82]Because that yellow indicator to me is like, oh, that's where you currently are standing.
[35:44.97]But it's... Is it?
[35:47.03]It's kind of like... I don't know.
[35:47.99]It's weird.
[35:55.67]Go this way.
[35:59.20]No.
[35:59.80]So is it this door back here?
[36:03.03]I'm just trying to get to the middle room again.
[36:07.01]I want to get into the middle room because there's two doors I haven't tried to open.
[36:09.63]But this is weird.
[36:11.35]Why can I not do this?
[36:11.99]Because that's the only door that is listed here.
[36:20.41]But is there one here?
[36:21.63]This is where I came from.
[36:28.90]So I should... If I go in this door, I should be in this spot.
[36:34.41]Okay.
[36:36.47]So this door should connect to the... But I can't go this way because... I need the elevator to go that way.
[36:44.43]Or that... Open this door.
[36:46.55]So I need to go all the way around to go through here?
[36:48.39]Don't just tell me where I would go.
[36:50.22]I have no idea where I'm going.
[36:54.22]Because I wanted to get to this middle room, but I can't go that way.
[36:56.99]So do I have to go all the way around and walk all the way around?
[37:06.19]No help.
[37:06.85]No, yes, help.
[37:07.91]Help me.
[37:12.29]Play the game.
[37:13.13]Yeah, it's a PS2 game, though.
[37:14.51]Sometimes it's just like, oh, find this random obscure thing that is good.
[37:17.34]You're going to walk around for 40 minutes to find it.
[37:29.05]Wait, I am in here.
[37:30.15]Hold on.
[37:33.33]But I can't... Okay, yeah.
[37:37.03]I cannot go this way.
[37:44.21]So I just have to go all the... I should just literally restart the save file.
[37:54.36]It's the place before the boss fight.
[37:56.60]Yeah, but I picked up the mask.
[37:57.90]Where does the mask even go?
[37:59.58]I guess I'm just going to go all the way around.
[38:02.45]Whatever.
[38:08.19]You're too busy talking about bouncy castles?
[38:14.72]Not really, though.
[38:15.46]I was...
[38:18.14]I got item B. I need to place item B into pedestal X. But I don't know where pedestal X is.
[38:30.83]That's the long and short of it.
[38:48.92]back where you missed the car.
[38:50.42]I just have to go all the way back around.
[38:54.05]Okay.
[39:07.54]Alright, so this is water.
[39:11.48]I mean, there's only literally two places where I could go do this.
[39:15.48]So, I guess let's see what's in here.
[39:24.08]Can't manipulate the water or something to go over there?
[39:27.32]It has to be right here.
[39:44.19]It worked.
[39:51.23]Is that not correct?
[40:02.87]500 IQ.
[40:04.49]I mean, there's no indication of where I'm supposed to go.
[40:08.72]It just says, here, you got an item.
[40:18.99]The white glowing wall.
[40:27.57]in this room?
[40:28.23]I thought this was a statue.
[40:37.85]Other lights like this have existed.
[40:40.10]This white light here was in like a dozen other rooms.
[40:45.82]Give me a break.
[40:50.00]We've walked by statues like that a dozen times already.
[41:10.08]That would be the 13th time then.
[41:14.16]That light has shown up a thousand times.
[41:18.32]Okay, this is for the main bridge.
[41:26.55]Is it a granny game?
[41:29.01]It's not a granny game.
[41:36.41]So the main bridge is the one...
[41:43.50]I don't think that was there a spot I could put this in.
[41:48.64]Milk brain.
[41:53.26]It is a granny like it kind of actually is a granny like, but there's just nothing chasing me.
[42:02.81]So I already got this one, is there was that was the main bridge?
[42:09.75]say it on it like the raw the rotating bridge is in there so I just have to go back is that where that thing goes that's the where I couldn't power the device before whatever it was and am I even going the right way I just don't even know what I don't even know what direction north or south even is I wish I had a compass or something give me a compass give me any indication of where what direction I'm facing
[42:39.35]Okay, and all the way around.
[43:00.49]How did you forget already?
[43:05.85]Because putting short-term into long-term memory is almost impossible for me to do.
[43:13.39]It is very difficult.
[43:15.55]With no guide system, it's actually really hard for me to put into longer-term memory.
[43:24.42]Especially when it's a very similar-looking landscape.
[43:26.44]It's actually pretty hard for me to do.
[43:31.93]Okay, but we are there now.
[43:34.45]Just have to go this way, right?
[43:44.68]Uh, fuck.
[43:48.48]Because that, yes, it's this way, right?
[43:53.42]Yes, because of the spider robe and you fight the spiders and you go this way.
[43:56.40]Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[44:01.25]Also, too, you can blame the video game industry.
[44:05.41]Because the video game industry in the last 10 to 20 years has made it impossible for you to not know where you're going.
[44:11.96]So when that's what you're used to for decades after this kind of concept here, the video game industry now is just like, make sure that they have absolutely, they cannot get lost no matter what.
[44:26.54]Back 20 years ago, it was like, good luck, you fucking dumbass.
[44:31.17]You gotta remember where that ball goes.
[44:47.31]That was... Yeah, I just realized how he just did that.
[44:49.49]Alright, so it can be moved.
[45:03.52]Alright, let's go.
[45:14.79]OK.
[45:19.49]Hey, we made it only took us like 30 minutes to get to this next part.
[45:22.56]Well, that was quick.
[45:36.06]That man... Did you kill him?
[45:39.88]So what if I did?
[45:40.64]Ooh, I love a fast woman.
[45:52.33]Shut up!
[45:55.85]He was obsessed with becoming the devil.
[45:58.15]So much, he killed his own wife!
[46:01.62]No!
[46:03.14]For that he butchered innocent people too.
[46:06.42]He's the most vile kind of creature.
[46:21.95]To top it off,
[46:32.03]That filthy scum is my father.
[46:35.00]Well, we have something in common.
[46:38.50]I have a dysfunctional family too.
[46:40.32]And what would you know about family?
[46:42.72]You're a demon.
[46:45.04]This is my father.
[46:47.68]My family.
[46:48.48]This was all supposed to end by my hand.
[47:07.94]How are they missing at point blank range?
[47:10.77]It's kind of a Capcom thing, isn't it?
[47:14.23]I feel like they do that frequently.
[47:17.51]Jesus, that was so much louder.
[47:39.86]Alright, well that's going to be high.
[47:41.54]We knew that was going to be high.
[47:44.20]Ooh, that's bad.
[47:45.30]No, this doesn't count.
[47:48.60]This is an issue because I didn't end the chapter.
[47:52.72]Alright, listen.
[47:53.74]It's really important.
[47:56.07]I didn't end the chapter.
[47:57.17]When we played last night, I beat the boss.
[47:59.23]I didn't end the chapter.
[48:01.57]I just kept running.
[48:03.39]That's why it was an issue here.
[48:05.11]Okay.
[48:08.58]Won't happen again.
[48:18.01]It's dark.
[48:18.61]I can't see anything.
[48:21.97]You're still alive, I see.
[48:25.81]Mary?
[48:28.35]Is that you?
[48:30.64]What's happening?
[48:33.06]Where's your mother?
[48:34.44]My mother?
[48:36.30]You killed her, remember?
[48:39.70]Yes.
[48:42.36]That's right.
[48:45.10]I killed her.
[48:47.25]This is what it's gonna be like when we have more microplastics in our blood?
[49:14.61]Yes, I was manipulated.
[49:18.74]True.
[49:18.90]Plot twist?
[49:19.22]What the fuck?
[49:19.82]Thought he was the bad guy.
[49:51.72]Stop, Virgil.
[49:55.48]My one regret is... You're such a sweet child.
[49:59.06]...talking in an evil voice, and wearing evil clothes.
[50:03.22]Just like your mother.
[50:09.18]If only I'd presented myself differently!
[50:11.71]Father!
[50:15.57]Father!
[50:22.19]Alright, let's go.
[50:27.89]Time for revenge.
[50:53.48]Alright, make sure I check my surroundings.
[50:55.24]Lock it into memory.
[50:55.94]Get it into long-term memory.
[50:57.64]That hallway was right there.
[50:58.68]I am now facing south in this room.
[51:03.88]There's only one of the doors.
[51:04.86]Not this one on the left side.
[51:06.38]You've got it.
[51:06.80]I don't know where I am.
[51:32.25]Okay, cool.
[51:36.07]Can I do anything with this spherical device here?
[51:40.39]No.
[51:43.58]Why did you play Resident Evil 4 on normal and not hardcore?
[51:46.52]Are you still on that?
[51:47.36]Are you still upset by that?
[51:50.42]I don't know.
[51:55.86]I wanted it to be
[51:59.23]an approachable kind of challenging, but not really, but focus on the game.
[52:04.50]I don't know.
[52:04.98]I felt like it.
[52:06.18]How does that sound?
[52:12.36]I'm not upset.
[52:21.49]I'm just disappointed.
[52:25.85]Yeah.
[52:26.65]Well, it's going to be fine.
[52:27.61]Don't worry.
[52:28.07]Because I'm going to first try this boss.
[52:31.54]I'm going to look over and see a ton of Pog U's.
[52:34.74]It's going to be crazy.
[52:53.31]Demon Bow!
[53:04.38]Where are you?
[53:04.70]Come on.
[53:12.68]That's the way to deal with these.
[53:13.66]Just shoot them.
[53:28.97]Oh, doesn't... Don't you just want to make the devil mad?
[53:36.40]Oh, doesn't it just make the devil mad?
[53:40.86]Three freakish looking faces are etched into the statue.
[53:45.31]Center face has tears of blood streaming down its face.
[53:48.21]Alright, the middle one has tears of blood.
[53:53.11]Where are we standing right now?
[53:55.35]We are in this room.
[53:56.90]This room is the one with the bloody eye statue.
[54:00.26]Bloody eye statue in this room that has the six on it.
[54:06.87]Got it.
[54:07.07]Okay.
[54:21.32]Are we looking for a bloody eye statue?
[54:23.64]If I were to guess.
[54:30.28]Can I do anything with this?
[54:34.96]Does one of these have tears of blood?
[54:40.91]I don't see it.
[54:41.43]Maybe up.
[54:49.05]How do I run up walls?
[54:50.13]I know I can, right?
[54:50.91]Hmm.
[55:17.16]This is like sticking out.
[55:34.34]Oh.
[55:34.64]Okay.
[55:38.14]I'm looking for like bloody eyes.
[55:40.40]I wasn't looking for a place to jump up.
[55:45.03]Okay.
[55:53.99]I found it.
[55:54.93]It takes a second.
[55:55.95]Can I push?
[56:04.43]It needs to be broken.
[56:05.27]Oh, there are two doors.
[56:24.35]Okay.
[56:25.77]This door is like a little too small for me.
[56:27.89]I have to push it into that door.
[56:32.31]Can you push?
[56:46.39]There's this one over here.
[56:47.29]Okay.
[56:49.83]What?
[56:49.99]I just... Why?
[56:51.11]What?
[56:52.56]I just tried to do that with the other one.
[56:58.87]This is a PS2 video game and you tell me it doesn't have the lean the shoulder down animation that goes Pushing something
[57:31.41]Hope I've got this lined up right.
[57:45.02]Mind-bending puzzles.
[57:46.56]Uh oh.
[57:56.62]I love the Earth exploding Rat Movie 2 sound effect.
[58:33.16]Where's my style?
[58:52.78]Sweet.
[58:56.84]Oh, what?
[58:57.29]Oh, I accidentally...
[59:08.53]Is that the Pizza Tower Orphan of Kos scream?
[59:12.53]I don't think it is.
[59:14.35]Maybe it is.
[59:19.83]OK, cool.
[59:23.91]I don't I'm not sure it is.
[59:25.18]I don't think it is.
[59:30.18]Where are we?
[59:31.84]Okay, we're still in this room.
[59:33.86]Another part of it too is going room 2, room 3, room 4 without looking at the map so then it's like I don't put into memory where I even am.
[59:42.30]But I'm doing that now.
[59:43.20]Look, I'm getting better.
[59:50.73]How's the audio?
[59:51.07]Did the audio need to be dropped like 5%?
[59:52.11]We good?
[59:52.97]A little loud?
[59:58.99]We good?
[60:08.32]This is different.
[60:14.09]Can't wait to... Oh, wait, I wanted that.
[60:15.91]Okay, never mind.
[60:17.61]Can't wait for Bugleberry the Musical to come out.
[60:46.58]Oh, stop.
[61:17.53]Should I sing the song?
[61:20.59]This one that goes... Yeah, yeah, I'm the one that you wanted.
[61:25.40]Yeah, yeah, I'm a super beast.
[61:28.50]Yeah, yeah...
[61:57.01]Nice.
[62:08.88]This game looks like it's kind of fun.
[62:12.91]I would agree with you.
[62:13.51]I think this game is kind of fun.
[62:14.91]You should check it out.
[62:23.53]How come?
[62:24.29]Why is it?
[62:26.39]You know what I'm really not happy with?
[62:29.01]Cerberus only has two upgrades.
[62:31.45]Everything else gets three.
[62:34.40]Some some get four.
[62:37.18]What's up with that?
[62:39.80]What's up with that?
[62:52.20]Uh, change the sword master.
[62:56.75]I'm going to lose my dodge, but it's alright.
[62:58.47]I think I've gotten used to the A dodge.
[63:00.07]I think I'm okay with using it.
[63:01.59]It's front loaded because it's the second weapon.
[63:05.71]That makes sense.
[63:08.02]Alright.
[63:08.60]Now, does that change what I can do?
[63:13.22]If I go into my... Where is it here?
[63:18.00]What menu is it under?
[63:18.94]So does that add anything to servers?
[63:30.50]I do that all the time.
[63:34.18]Yep, I do this all the time.
[63:38.74]Yep.
[63:41.43]Windmill Satellite.
[63:43.99]Spin your nunchucks around your body, devastating all enemies around you.
[63:49.33]Ooh.
[63:53.33]What's the type 2 combo for Cerberus?
[63:58.07]why why pause why why okay so why why pause why why why oh it's listed wrong it's x let's do it
[64:34.77]There it is.
[64:36.31]Okay.
[64:37.39]So the pause is actually pretty long.
[64:39.28]Okay.
[64:44.84]So it's boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[64:50.82]So what does that one do?
[64:51.84]That's the style button, right?
[65:05.10]Press circle.
[65:05.76]That's what I'm doing.
[65:12.91]Oh, you poor thing.
[65:22.72]Didn't your mother teach you how to use a door?
[65:27.82]I knew it.
[65:33.24]Give me a break.
[65:35.36]Tell you what, next time I'll try and wear some cologne, okay?
[65:39.72]It's the stench of betrayal.
[65:42.46]The odor of that accursed spider.
[65:44.75]I love voices like this.
[65:45.71]It's like half the characters in the game.
[65:52.17]I want to do these voices.
[65:55.75]A son cleaning up his dad's mess, huh?
[66:00.05]Where have I heard this story before?
[66:07.59]Oh, I don't have a dodge roll.
[66:09.37]I'm trying to dodge roll around this.
[66:10.77]Whoops.
[66:50.85]Oh shit, what?
[66:52.40]He hit me with his stun.
[66:53.74]I stunned him and it hurt me.
[67:06.15]Oops.
[67:08.23]Alright, so... I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[67:19.67]It's actually kind of hard to do those super combos during bosses.
[67:22.71]Because they kind of just hit you out of them.
[67:29.37]Alright, I think I did alright for a first try.
[67:41.84]Let's go.
[68:00.85]Dammit.
[68:03.40]Sorry.
[68:13.77]Let's go!
[68:38.21]Oh shit.
[68:40.21]Oh!
[68:40.37]What's he doing?
[68:42.01]What the fuck are you doing?
[68:43.35]Oh my god.
[68:45.61]Jesus!
[68:55.74]Ow.
[69:09.41]Jeez.
[69:14.95]Oh my God.
[69:15.59]That's a huge area.
[69:16.92]You just have to run.
[69:17.66]I'm dead.
[69:21.38]I'm in trouble.
[69:22.82]Okay.
[69:28.42]Alright.
[69:30.52]So his phase two, he, he says crush.
[69:34.32]And then a gigantic AOE explosion happens underneath his feet.
[69:45.24]You gotta be careful.
[69:46.04]One weapon Andy.
[69:50.65]Let's not start switching around before I know his moves.
[69:59.84]That shouldn't hurt you.
[70:01.18]That shouldn't hurt you.
[70:03.40]He's staggered and his arms can be... His LEDs on his arms hurt you.
[70:35.59]Alright, here we go.
[70:45.34]Here comes this bullshit.
[70:57.97]No jump!
[71:27.28]Watch out!
[71:33.08]Stop ju- What the fuck?
[71:34.36]Stop jumping, man!
[71:43.19]Get me out of the corner!
[72:00.86]No!
[72:03.30]Trying to get that range.
[72:04.86]Oh, it sucks.
[72:06.51]God damn it.
[72:26.31]What?
[72:26.79]Oh, it's alright.
[72:39.45]When you lock on and you do the Diablo walk.
[72:43.32]I just want to get in there, but I have to do the Diablo walk.
[73:41.24]Oh, shit!
[73:42.04]I tried to dodge, but I had my button... My hand was on, like, four different buttons.
[73:45.84]Fuck!
[73:46.41]No!
[73:47.37]I'm throwing it so hard now.
[73:49.39]I was actually... My fingers were on four different buttons.
[73:52.63]I couldn't dodge.
[73:54.28]Oh, my God.
[73:55.38]Oh, my God.
[74:04.29]I had my index finger holding right trigger.
[74:08.43]My left finger is on stick.
[74:10.64]I have to press left trigger to switch to this other weapon.
[74:13.68]I have to then press right trigger.
[74:15.58]I've got one, two, three, four.
[74:17.54]I've got five buttons being pressed at the same time.
[74:23.80]Start over.
[74:29.92]I'm playing Bop It with Devil May Cry in my hands.
[74:38.42]That was such a good start, too.
[74:39.59]I threw it away.
[74:40.15]I just threw it in the trash.
[74:57.38]That shouldn't hit you.
[75:01.22]They should patch the game.
[75:26.13]God damn it.
[75:26.95]What?
[75:50.07]Such an awful camera for this to be right now.
[75:52.05]Please change it.
[75:53.77]How do I force this to happen?
[75:55.49]I have to just get him in this corner.
[76:02.20]I jumped over it.
[76:03.16]Let's kill me.
[76:10.06]Let's kill me.
[76:11.36]We're starting over.
[76:17.58]I feel like I'm gonna eventually be pressing every single button on the controller, and I'm gonna get an error message from Microsoft.
[76:24.28]I'm gonna hold left trigger, left bumper, then his right bumper, right trigger, Y, X, and B at the same time, and it's gonna go... And it's gonna turn my fucking computer off.
[76:42.20]Yeah, I'm accidentally gonna hit start, and then press that combination, and it's gonna reset the game, like these old games used to do.
[77:24.74]Turn this camera.
[77:26.16]Turn this camera around now.
[77:27.74]I hate that move.
[77:35.39]It's so unfair.
[77:42.03]Start over.
[77:55.17]Please just do it.
[78:01.63]Devil trigger heals?
[78:02.95]Not very much.
[78:05.51]I gotta get to phase two with like 80% health.
[78:07.21]Press R3 to reset your camera.
[78:17.04]Yeah, it doesn't work half the time though.
[78:19.74]I feel like it works when I'm out of combat.
[78:21.76]But when in combat, it just doesn't work anymore.
[78:25.58]I've been trying to do it.
[78:36.68]What?
[79:17.21]No, it does it every time!
[79:18.53]Alright, we're good.
[79:44.11]Jump!
[79:45.17]What?
[79:50.12]Oh my god, it's so unbearable.
[80:30.77]Alright, here we go.
[80:50.06]What is that?
[80:51.56]What is that move?
[80:53.66]Oh, my God.
[80:54.92]Okay.
[81:02.55]I don't have any heals.
[81:12.70]What does this do?
[81:13.30]I need more of these.
[81:20.72]I have, okay.
[81:28.00]I've got heals.
[81:28.75]I'm doing it.
[81:30.89]It's not my inventory.
[81:39.59]Okay, you can't use this item right now.
[81:47.16]He does not have heals.
[81:50.52]Devil Star just refills DT.
[81:52.94]Okay.
[81:54.82]So just use it.
[81:56.42]Do a crazy combo.
[81:57.44]Use it.
[81:57.84]Just train it together.
[82:10.49]I'm buying this.
[82:18.70]I'm buying it again.
[82:21.74]I'm buying it again.
[82:31.23]Did that just potentially fix everything?
[82:34.59]That's a lot more than I had before.
[82:38.89]Finally, holy shit.
[82:40.21]I thought everyone was yelling at me not to buy things from the item menu.
[82:43.79]I thought it was only for, only put it in your moves and weapons.
[82:48.06]I thought I was going to be stupid for doing that.
[82:49.76]I thought everyone was going to make fun of me.
[83:36.47]Shit, that was a stupid mistake from me.
[83:38.93]Go ahead, yup.
[83:57.84]Alright, let's go.
[84:18.86]What?
[84:21.10]How do you get away from that?
[84:22.18]Is that move completely unavoidable?
[84:24.10]Oh my god, this is so bad.
[84:36.15]I have to hold down to dodge in that angle.
[84:40.24]Contextually needing to pick a different direction to dodge to get it to do the right dodge.
[84:44.04]Oh, it's making me want to puke.
[84:52.49]so to dodge you have to dodge laterally so if the camera is not behind you a lot of times you have to hit down and A to do a lateral dodge versus left and right and A it just changes constantly to do a lateral dodge what the heck
[85:17.15]to do this, to do what I'm doing here, I have to like press down.
[85:20.97]But sometimes when you press down, you do a backflip because your character turned around and you were locked on and the camera didn't turn around with you.
[85:28.93]So a down actually turns out to be a lateral dodge.
[85:34.20]This is freaking ridiculous.
[85:35.32]And I'm sorry, I said a swear word.
[86:11.09]He catches me with it every time.
[87:03.03]Oh my god, thank god I was in this mode.
[87:20.49]Wow, that move sucks.
[87:25.49]Jesus!
[87:32.99]My controls are backwards.
[87:34.21]I don't want to fight him that way.
[87:55.24]God damn it.
[88:14.56]What is happening?
[88:23.99]Oh my god, please!
[88:42.21]Oh, no, no, I just pissed him off.
[89:00.66]Oh, that sucked.
[89:01.82]That was not good.
[89:02.85]That was very bad.
[89:11.46]I don't have any heals.
[89:17.14]Turn it on quick!
[89:55.23]That fight was kinda rough.
[90:22.41]So dodging like this and going backwards, but to dodge backwards, it's up.
[90:29.51]And when he's this way, it's like this way, down.
[90:32.55]It's like patting your head and rubbing your stomach at the same time.
[90:41.78]Alright, we're good.
[90:51.49]Side rolls suck.
[90:52.25]You got to unlock and jump.
[90:54.55]Yeah, I've been conditioned from every FromSoftware game.
[90:57.79]Unfortunately.
[91:04.12]Just run back and just let go and run back.
[91:05.86]Yeah.
[91:08.04]I'm playing against the... There we are.
[91:10.46]Okay, we're back in it now.
[91:22.04]FromSoftware Brain Rot.
[91:50.73]B for brain rot.
[91:53.35]This is amazing!
[91:58.20]Even the devil boy is no match for it!
[92:06.91]You're not going to shoot me, are you?
[92:09.43]If you do, I'll die.
[92:12.33]You know?
[92:13.29]If that's what it takes to shut you up, it bugs the crap out of me when someone talks more than I do.
[92:19.56]Don't act so rashly, my boy.
[92:22.68]I've got a doozy of a story for you.
[92:25.51]But if you snuff out my voice like that, I won't be able to tell it now, will I?
[92:37.62]I thought I was a goner for sure.
[92:39.20]Oops.
[92:44.64]You saw it too, didn't you?
[92:46.67]That huge tower jutting out of the ground.
[92:49.39]That thick shaft that causes women to shudder.
[92:53.97]It's actually internal.
[92:55.57]Linking the demonic domain to the human world.
[92:58.21]And of course, your brother Vangel is the one who controls it by using your mommy's amulet.
[93:05.36]Amulet?
[93:08.14]He's headed to the control room in the basement.
[93:12.00]If you don't hop down there quick like a bunny, he'll open the gate to hell.
[93:16.70]Isn't that a scary thought?
[93:19.94]It's really making me angry.
[93:21.38]Oops, I forgot to mention one teeny little item.
[93:27.73]That gizmo there is actually the key to move forward.
[93:31.04]Everyone's saying this is me.
[93:32.36]And I'm like, no, it's not.
[93:35.66]It is.
[93:36.72]At least it sucks to have to know that.
[93:43.23]Like, that's real.
[93:44.99]It actually is.
[93:45.75]Like, yeah.
[93:48.75]I can't fight that.
[93:50.19]I can't deny that.
[93:51.03]Ah!
[94:02.79]Maybe not that part.
[94:03.53]Try that laugh out.
[94:04.03]No.
[94:04.11]No, I just won't play.
[94:04.59]I can't.
[94:04.92]Because it's going to be cringe-inducing.
[94:32.15]Let me get this to level 2.
[94:34.21]I want to level this up to 2.
[94:35.51]I'm curious about it.
[94:43.80]Alright.
[94:45.62]He who holds this broken device is irradiated and their soul is drained in exchange for power.
[94:56.40]Oh, I gotta go.
[94:58.42]Where do I go?
[95:04.36]Where do I need to go?
[95:14.89]Oh no.
[96:00.46]Blow up!
[96:01.62]Blow up!
[96:18.53]Oh...
[96:51.29]Got it.
[96:57.41]We're good.
[97:09.80]This game would have given me an ulcer when I was a kid.
[97:11.97]Hold on.
[97:21.43]Come on, get it right.
[97:24.57]Come on, I gotta get it right.
[97:25.43]There it is.
[97:32.68]There it is.
[97:52.37]What's happening?
[97:53.13]I'm losing it.
[97:53.89]I just freaked out.
[97:57.53]I'm freaking out.
[97:58.38]I can't fucking get it back.
[97:59.96]I thought it was S. What is it?
[98:01.76]I'm dead.
[98:08.03]It's higher than S?
[98:31.34]Yeah!
[99:01.42]Jesus!
[99:01.98]Press B?
[99:04.94]Oh, I got a new orb.
[99:07.23]Nice.
[99:10.03]Right.
[99:10.59]Forget what style I'm on half the time.
[99:46.94]What the hell?
[99:55.44]What's going on?
[99:59.74]What was that, dude?
[100:01.42]What the hell was that?
[100:05.11]Oh my god!
[100:07.05]What was that?
[100:11.61]Why did the game just do that?
[100:14.03]You gotta be kidding me.
[100:15.11]That fucking hurt big time.
[100:19.55]What?
[100:23.71]Why did that just happen?
[100:29.83]Whoa.
[100:36.70]That was actually fucked up.
[100:41.28]Is that a bug in the game?
[100:42.48]That that can happen?
[100:43.82]No way.
[100:49.26]Wow, that sucked.
[100:52.28]Hopefully that wasn't too bad for everybody else.
[100:56.16]I think that was really bad.
[101:00.76]Oh my god.
[101:01.88]Why the fuck did that happen?
[101:05.84]Jesus.
[101:13.58]Whoa.
[101:24.20]Is everybody alright?
[101:25.00]Like, I'm serious.
[101:25.78]That was actually really, really bad.
[101:27.48]Is everybody, like, doing alright?
[101:28.76]Because that sucked.
[101:33.78]I'm terrified.
[101:34.37]I'm, like, scared to play the game now.
[101:35.93]Is that weird?
[101:36.97]Dude, it's the fucking HD remake.
[101:50.34]Yeah?
[101:52.42]What the fuck was that?
[101:55.86]Really?
[102:10.90]What was it?
[102:12.10]I don't know.
[102:12.60]It was something with the game?
[102:15.82]I wish I could tell you what just even happened.
[102:31.44]Because look at, I mean, take a look.
[102:34.70]The volume should never, should not be even possible to go that high.
[102:38.65]Even over here in my, in my OBS, I have the, my, so this is coming through desktop audio.
[102:43.39]So desktop audio is set to, I have it limited.
[102:46.79]There's a limiter on it.
[102:49.07]And in the game, it's only at halfway.
[102:57.56]That was extreme audio.
[103:02.06]Did you hit your mic?
[103:02.98]No, no, that was in the game.
[103:04.12]That was in this video game.
[103:08.94]Fuck, that's not cool.
[103:17.47]It's a glitch on this level.
[103:19.23]I've had that happen before.
[103:20.49]Okay, actually patch the game, Capcom.
[103:26.63]Actually patch the game.
[103:27.79]What?
[103:39.28]Is that actually possible to happen here?
[103:43.11]Dude, I am so fucked up right now.
[103:45.01]Does it still count that I got this?
[103:49.01]I don't want to hit any enemies.
[104:04.33]I'm sorry.
[104:04.87]I'm doing this till we confirm this is not going to happen again.
[104:19.50]This shit is at 5, not even 3%.
[104:20.84]The game's muted?
[104:34.53]Yeah.
[104:35.36]This is the room that it happened in.
[104:36.40]I'm not having that happen again.
[104:51.31]I... Oh, my God.
[104:53.29]I'm, like, shook from that.
[105:03.48]I'm gonna, like, die again.
[105:04.66]Should I... Let's just run.
[105:10.44]I don't think I'm gonna make it.
[105:17.35]Yeah, alright.
[105:18.13]I'm just gonna run next time.
[105:18.87]Wait, can I not...
[105:27.59]I'm gonna have to, like, highlight this VOD and reupload it or something, because I'm not having people deal with that.
[105:35.34]That's so fucking awful.
[105:36.96]No, I'm gonna have to, like, do an edit to the VOD.
[105:41.66]Can I just leave?
[105:42.18]Okay, I think I just run.
[105:58.44]Alright, so where do I need to... Where am I trying to get to?
[106:02.57]It's back to the beginning, right?
[106:08.19]Come on, hurry up.
[106:13.90]Fuck, I don't know where to go.
[106:16.06]This way?
[106:22.40]Shit.
[106:31.91]I gotta kill this fast.
[106:33.28]Do I have any health?
[106:34.14]I don't have any healing.
[106:36.58]Oh, that's bad.
[106:37.22]Alright.
[106:41.71]I need heals.
[106:42.79]But, wait, I'm at full health.
[106:44.08]This is actually good.
[106:50.78]That clip was blasted out.
[106:53.12]Yeah, that's... You know, I take really seriously stuff like that because... I always... People always ask, hey, dude, your game volume is kind of quiet or this is kind of quiet.
[107:04.99]The amount of shit that gets through the cracks in some of these games or that can blow out people's fucking speakers.
[107:13.38]I try to reduce it as best as I can.
[107:18.03]But man, oh man, something like that happening is just like, holy fucking shit.
[107:42.01]No, where am I going?
[107:43.63]I'm going the wrong way.
[107:49.57]You should watch the clip.
[107:51.99]Uh, hold on.
[107:53.89]We're in a cut scene, but give me a sec.
[108:10.95]Alright.
[108:11.91]Listen to the clip right now.
[108:13.25]God, let me see.
[108:14.09]Why is that even possible?
[108:25.55]Why?
[108:36.78]No, that's actually not alright.
[108:39.16]I'm being dead serious.
[108:40.42]I just listened to this at, like, 1%.
[108:41.94]That's not alright.
[108:44.00]Is that actually a bug in the game?
[108:46.32]Because, like, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[108:54.99]No?
[109:00.77]I've played it.
[109:01.35]I've never had this happen.
[109:05.11]Dude, we know you farted.
[109:06.69]This is the PC version.
[109:11.39]Yeah, this is the Steam HD version.
[109:18.32]Oh my goodness.
[109:23.24]I mean, how, why did that?
[109:25.36]I don't even have an explanation for you.
[109:30.54]Is there something on my end?
[109:31.58]I don't think so.
[109:35.04]Not that I could see.
[109:36.10]I mean, I've been sitting here playing it the same way since like, you know, two, three hours ago, since last night.
[109:44.14]Restart the game?
[109:45.02]Yeah, I'm going to restart the game.
[109:51.14]The whole HD collection has audio bugs from what, from our understanding.
[109:55.65]Okay.
[109:56.65]An HD edition only bug.
[110:10.11]Are you in a Discord call?
[110:11.36]No, no, I'm not.
[110:12.44]Alright, let me restart the game to get like the audio kind of recombobulated.
[110:24.04]And one of the some of the mods have editing access.
[110:32.19]I guess I can't really do it right now while I'm live.
[110:34.66]Can one of the mods go and do a highlight of the stream like two or three seconds before that part?
[110:41.70]And then... I'm trying to think of how to do this to get rid of that.
[110:49.25]I'll finish the mission, yeah.
[110:50.45]But this is staying on like 1%.
[111:07.46]Yeah, highlight before and after, and then we'll delete the VOD.
[111:12.78]Alright, I'm going in the wrong direction.
[111:15.42]What, a sound warning?
[111:17.52]Yeah, I mean, a sound warning for kind of a jump scare or something is one thing, but... I just listened to that.
[111:24.40]And I've been jump scared.
[111:25.64]I've had loud shit happen on this stream.
[111:27.70]That's... I don't want anybody to fucking hear that.
[111:31.36]That was well and beyond what... Like, oh, a jump scare, or like a loud sound or something.
[111:43.83]Okay, is there a save point here?
[111:50.03]Why wouldn't you play this on Switch?
[111:53.14]I don't know, dude.
[111:53.70]I didn't know that- Oh, by the way, there's like ear-exploding audio bugs in the HD Steam version.
[111:59.08]I didn't know that.
[112:00.02]I didn't know.
[112:01.92]I just bought the game on Steam.
[112:04.17]I'm just a consumer in this.
[112:17.29]Okay.
[112:19.29]I don't think I can save it.
[112:25.29]I really hope that doesn't happen again.
[112:26.73]It actually is freaking me out.
[112:28.56]I'm not gonna lie to you.
[112:43.74]Did I fight him again?
[112:56.18]Turn on latency mode so you can cut it if it happens again.
[112:58.52]I wonder what the process of that would look like.
[113:16.44]Live editing.
[113:21.59]Yeah, but there's audio bugs and then there's something is potentially left in the game that can like break people's fucking computers.
[113:38.46]Like speakers, headphones, even me.
[114:02.26]no evidence that it was in the game yeah well that's why I'm I'd like to investigate it a little bit more but I have my obs settings have been the same from I mean it's got to be like a half a decade at this point I didn't really change anything
[114:49.69]would your settings matter if it was a bug well what it look I I don't want to watch the clip again but it looked like when I switched I switched between weapons so I went I attacked with the nunchucks and then I in mid combo I went wham and I switched over to this and I did that this move that one and I think it hit something and hit them in the game's brain like a thousand times in a second or something
[115:23.02]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[115:30.32]Why won't he die?
[115:30.76]Die!
[115:37.51]What?
[115:39.35]Oh my god, what is going on right now?
[115:44.25]Why did he...
[115:55.21]At 1 HP.
[116:04.97]Yeah, also add to the VOD, add a thing that says, like, don't watch this VOD.
[116:09.11]Loud sound.
[116:09.89]Make sure people know that.
[116:11.71]Before we, you know, delete it.
[116:27.56]I could also BRB so I could do a restart of the stream.
[116:31.36]I think that's probably what I'm going to do.
[116:42.39]Oh, you can unpublish the VOD.
[116:43.47]Okay.
[116:43.87]Yeah, then do that.
[116:55.53]Don't watch this VOD, seriously.
[117:15.44]You've been louder before?
[117:16.46]No, no way.
[117:18.76]When I listen to that clip at like 0.2% volume, that's the loudest that this stream has ever been.
[117:33.27]Come here.
[117:33.57]Alright, once I get this kill, I'm gonna.
[117:46.30]Restart the game.
[117:46.86]Alright, well, this parts annoying.
[118:08.26]Okay, now watch out!
[118:08.86]This thing explodes!
[118:09.46]Get away, Dante!
[118:24.25]Oh my god, I'm going to lose again.
[118:26.75]I actually might.
[118:27.73]No, I'm not.
[118:29.19]I don't care.
[118:29.73]I have Mandy.
[118:30.09]I would have died right there.
[118:50.07]Okay.
[119:03.58]Yeah, sorry it's been silent, but I need to restart the game and we gotta make sure that the VOD is not gonna fuck a bunch of people up.
[119:18.35]Haunted.
[119:21.66]music on I'll put a little music on the background that makes sense to me uh how about um reduce the game volume from the actual mixer if the audio engine is bugged out it will ignore your in-game settings and go super loud again
[119:50.48]Yeah, I'll go right to the source here and I'll just put it here.
[119:53.14]I wonder if that helps.
[119:57.68]I'm going to put it at like 20% in the mixer.
[120:04.62]Volume gate.
[120:05.46]There is a volume.
[120:05.94]I have a volume gate on OBS.
[120:08.74]I have a slider where I can put that the audio should never go over that, but sometimes it just doesn't matter apparently.
[120:14.74]Okay.
[120:18.76]Let me get to the end of this and save the game.
[120:22.36]See if that fixed it.
[120:34.70]I need a save point.
[120:46.39]Um, what did that even just do?
[120:51.77]Did I get an item?
[120:54.03]Okay, here we go.
[120:54.53]Save data.
[120:58.03]Save complete.
[120:58.59]Alright, let me restart this.
[121:01.19]I'll do BRB as well.
[121:02.71]Because I'm going to get some water.
[121:05.00]Give the mods an ability to clean up that VOD and do all this shit.
[121:10.18]Let me get some water.
[121:11.16]Take a break.
[121:12.12]I'll be right back.
[121:51.30]Okay.
[121:52.26]Water time.
[128:24.39]Okay, hello.
[128:26.49]I'm back.
[128:31.51]I am going to reopen Devil May Cry.
[128:34.27]I have it set in Windows for it to never be possible to go over a certain decibel in Windows.
[128:40.67]I'll be honest with you, I'm fucking paranoid about this now.
[128:46.96]If it happens once, it means it can happen twice.
[128:48.52]You know what I'm saying?
[128:51.28]Okay.
[128:57.16]Let me get it open.
[129:00.84]To remove clips of the noise.
[129:04.29]Oh, yeah.
[129:09.37]Yeah, guys, if you got clips, make sure the clips say like in the title, like audio warning.
[129:15.25]Because, yeah, that's we got to be fucking careful with that shit.
[129:33.85]There's no way that came out of the game.
[129:35.11]Yeah, but that's also freaking me out because it's like, how, where would it be coming from from my end too, right?
[129:42.83]Like, I am flabbergasted as to how that happened.
[129:46.63]Okay, let me make sure this is going to happen the way that I want it to.
[129:57.60]Mixer.
[129:59.04]Alright.
[130:01.50]It's at 30 percentile.
[130:29.40]I almost want to... Yeah, well, we'll see.
[130:31.31]I have no idea what happened, but... I don't think... I honestly think there probably is not a way to ever know, like, what actually just happened.
[130:49.24]Okay, so now I have it set.
[130:57.36]Volume is in the same place.
[130:58.62]I put the volume on the Windows mixer down.
[131:00.88]See if that helps.
[131:29.64]Okay, let's go back here.
[131:34.06]Should see it.
[131:47.99]So this is the, where's the last save point?
[131:51.49]Oh shit.
[132:00.49]Oh no.
[132:02.13]How far back did I go?
[132:02.97]That's not terrible.
[132:07.73]Oh, is it terrible?
[132:08.97]No, it's not.
[132:09.45]I just have to go fast.
[132:26.00]I know the audio is probably a little low right now, but I'm trying to get it to a point where it's not horrible if that happens again.
[132:46.96]Better raise my volume.
[132:48.63]No, don't.
[133:38.39]What if it happens again, I don't know I
[133:42.08]That's why I'm being like super quiet and timid.
[133:45.64]Right?
[133:47.38]The energy has changed since then.
[133:50.00]You know what I'm saying?
[133:51.65]It's changed.
[134:08.74]Are you shaking?
[134:12.88]I don't know how loud... I turned up my speakers on my end here.
[134:18.58]Independently.
[134:19.99]Before that happened.
[134:20.83]So I... Yeah, I got hit in the fucking head.
[134:23.47]With like a brick.
[134:24.07]That's what it feels like.
[134:27.25]Okay, sword piece.
[134:29.09]Hold down right bump at the press B. Does it have to be the... Ooh, okay.
[134:39.44]Okay.
[134:48.29]So it was when I used the B move for this weapon, the fire hit somebody and it was all of a sudden the game just started freaking out.
[134:55.68]Almost like the game was lagging, like hardware lag, like, oh, something's fucked up.
[135:00.18]And then it just, it was as if I hit the guy like a thousand times in a row.
[135:14.61]There's the forbidden move.
[135:17.88]Feels like it.
[135:28.22]I'm gonna finagle with it.
[135:29.12]So, the volume will increase.
[135:37.86]I just gotta get it to the right spot where it can't go over a certain threshold.
[135:42.04]It was in this room, by the way.
[135:43.26]I'm afraid of this room, but I'm only gonna use the nunchucks.
[136:03.75]It was that enemy right there.
[136:10.91]And I did that B move right here.
[136:12.69]I don't know, man.
[136:15.45]I don't know.
[136:15.87]I wish I knew.
[136:23.84]I'm from the future, dude.
[136:24.74]It's going to happen again.
[136:26.46]Don't say that.
[136:36.58]Okay.
[136:37.62]With that being the case, what if I go like this?
[136:41.42]And then like this.
[136:44.04]Technically speaking, I have it set to, in the Windows Mixer, Devil May Cry is set to 30% right now.
[136:56.39]So that means that it cannot go over that by the computer's operating system, right?
[137:04.03]No matter what.
[137:13.76]Surely.
[137:16.42]Well, just be aware that could happen again.
[137:18.90]I don't know how or why, but just be aware.
[137:21.06]I would probably watch the stream at fucking 50% volume at least.
[137:39.47]Shit.
[137:39.71]I need to just run.
[137:41.11]Oh, I fucked up again.
[137:45.60]Uh, I'm gonna have to heal.
[137:47.22]Because I really don't want to do this again.
[137:56.21]Where's my... Do I even have heals?
[137:59.83]I do.
[138:00.13]Yeah, okay.
[138:01.09]Wait.
[138:01.97]This is the wrong menu.
[138:03.97]What's the right menu?
[138:07.35]Is it down?
[138:08.19]No.
[138:08.65]How do I get to the fucking menu?
[138:10.21]I'm dead.
[138:22.32]I'm so fucked up right now.
[138:30.56]That actually like flash banged me in real life.
[138:37.33]Let me start it over.
[138:38.09]Come on, kill me already.
[139:01.64]I wish there was base cam for that.
[139:04.28]It would have been awful looking.
[139:07.29]I had my volume so loud too because I was like, yeah, let me rock out to the fucking music.
[139:12.75]Yeah, Devil May Cry, let's go.
[139:15.11]I just had to walk in that door.
[139:22.42]It just killed me.
[139:29.70]Okay.
[139:45.49]Should've just got it on the fucking switch.
[139:47.07]How was I supposed to know?
[139:52.14]And why do you even have to play that fucking game of merry-go-round when a game comes out?
[140:06.85]We got, like, if there's four or five versions of the game.
[140:09.28]Oh, don't play that one.
[140:10.36]That one's fucked.
[140:12.58]Huh?
[140:27.12]Okay.
[140:36.92]The audio sounds okay now, right?
[140:40.37]You guys are hearing all the sounds and everything?
[141:11.02]Yeah, and honestly, I don't even know if that was from the game.
[141:14.49]Who knows?
[141:14.99]Was it a thing, like a bug into OBS or my audio equipment?
[141:18.47]Who fucking knows?
[141:19.39]I'm terrified of it happening again.
[142:05.21]It sounded like your mic fell down.
[142:06.69]No, I was just sitting here.
[142:08.09]I was just sitting right here just playing the game.
[142:15.80]Well done everyone!
[142:55.75]Shit.
[143:27.91]Get back down here, please Shit I'm dead
[143:59.82]okay let's go
[144:28.70]Why did I wait that long?
[144:35.83]I just wasted that so bad.
[144:36.91]Okay.
[145:27.95]Well, I did it again, but sorry.
[145:46.36]Watch out for the explosion.
[146:17.54]I'm going to lose it.
[146:18.16]I lose it every time in the last 10 seconds of this fucking fight.
[146:32.88]Okay.
[146:43.68]Why is the game quiet?
[146:44.99]Somebody tell him.
[146:51.25]I did beat him already, but I had to restart the game because I was afraid of something bugging out and fucking up the audio.
[146:58.17]Okay, so I just beat him.
[147:00.77]So now we go down here.
[147:04.51]This is correct, right?
[147:17.46]Here we are here.
[147:47.15]Is the boss Boss right after a boss, huh?
[148:01.04]Jesus
[148:24.50]I wonder if there's a... Hmm
[148:55.91]Is it just to attack it, or?
[148:57.23]Oh, shit, I'm dead.
[149:11.70]I'll be full health now, okay.
[149:30.62]Let's try it again.
[149:31.30]Hmm.
[149:48.39]Alright, when it's fully charged, you can't do it.
[150:15.75]Whoa!
[150:22.15]Oh, I can't double jump unless it's out.
[150:23.51]Phase two?
[150:46.33]First chicken now gladiator.
[150:53.15]This just keeps getting better and better.
[150:56.31]Too bad there's nobody here to enjoy the show.
[151:00.32]OK.
[151:15.88]Do I hit the carriage or hit the horse?
[151:17.34]I feel like it's the carriage.
[151:38.95]Oh, right here.
[151:54.94]Come here.
[152:32.85]Really?
[152:34.79]Please, camera.
[152:55.24]Whoa!
[152:58.15]Whoa!
[153:08.81]Alright, I should get it right here.
[153:21.32]Oh, don't blow it right now.
[153:22.44]I could right now.
[153:42.14]Let's just die.
[153:42.78]Uh oh.
[153:50.59]Okay, please.
[154:03.24]Almost through.
[154:03.92]It was close.
[154:04.20]Almost.
[154:06.00]Almost.
[154:36.39]Yeah?
[154:36.53]Why are you being so serious?
[154:43.92]To be honest, I'm very annoyed.
[154:46.40]I'm very annoyed in real life.
[154:56.93]I'm exceptionally irritated right now.
[155:02.99]Alright, Quicksilver.
[155:08.74]Is this a new style?
[155:09.96]No.
[155:11.62]It is a new style.
[155:25.60]Chill out, dude.
[155:26.16]Just move it to easy mode.
[155:27.62]Yeah, I'm just so fucking mad at the game.
[155:32.31]I'm exceptionally irritated right now.
[155:37.33]It's nothing to do with like the video game.
[155:42.39]But, it's all good.
[156:04.80]I told you that I remembered your rancid scent.
[156:07.12]No matter where you run to, you can never hide me.
[156:12.26]Are these guys back?
[156:19.03]You.
[156:20.31]You're not the one I faced before.
[156:23.39]But this smell.
[156:24.69]There are two of you.
[156:27.39]That excellent spider had two sons.
[156:41.36]Why was it so easy for Virgil and it was so hard for me?
[156:44.07]That makes me scared of Virgil a little more.
[157:14.38]Is the game worth it?
[157:19.01]I mean, I'm having fun with the game.
[157:20.21]Yeah.
[157:22.50]Oh, spoiler.
[157:25.62]That's the first time I've gotten damage to see ever.
[157:28.38]That's pretty good.
[157:56.97]Put the volume back up.
[157:58.83]I think it's safe to put it back.
[158:03.74]I have it in my Windows mixer all the way down, so... I think I can turn it up over here and we should be alright.
[158:26.18]You can mod the game so it has style changing.
[158:28.78]I saw that, actually.
[158:29.74]People were talking about that when I first played it.
[158:31.32]I think it's alright for now.
[158:37.54]So this is 13. 13.
[158:56.09]I refilled my drink and I don't even know where it is.
[158:59.93]Alright, BRB.
[159:00.73]Go pee again.
[159:02.44]I just made a drink and I don't know what to do with it.
[159:04.08]I'll be right back.
[160:36.82]Alright, I got my drink back.
[160:37.58]It was in the bathroom.
[160:39.66]It was in the bathroom.
[161:00.86]Why was it in the bathroom, you ask?
[161:02.17]Because I went pee.
[161:05.56]And I brought it into the bathroom.
[161:06.80]I thought you were going to restart stream.
[161:17.89]I restarted the game.
[161:20.03]I don't know.
[161:20.63]I can't give a reason why that happened.
[161:24.60]I really can't.
[161:25.78]Unless it was the game kind of lagged and got fucked up in the engine with the... I don't know.
[161:31.10]We have to cheer him up.
[161:32.56]No, I'm good.
[161:33.56]I'm just, it's... I hate doing that to people.
[161:37.91]More than anything.
[161:40.55]There's a limit to, you know, loud fucking sound.
[161:46.11]And there's a limit to it, I think.
[161:48.09]Doing that to that many people, it really pisses me off that it happened.
[161:52.52]I hate doing that shit.
[161:56.56]You know, like loud sounds, like a jump scare, holy shit!
[161:59.50]But that was not good.
[162:01.40]And I fucking hate that.
[162:04.56]So.
[162:05.32]Alright.
[162:06.52]Get it out of my system.
[162:14.84]I got a lot of money.
[162:18.31]That was an hour ago.
[162:19.93]Yeah, but I'm like a won't move on Andy.
[162:22.41]I'm like, fuck, I like hate that I, that happened.
[162:30.68]Seriously, like, I'm just like, I just wish I could go back and delete it.
[162:33.78]Okay.
[162:44.57]What is this new style?
[162:47.57]I'm controlling style.
[162:49.54]Well, I have to try it.
[162:50.48]I could buy some orbs, too.
[163:00.29]I'm doing it.
[163:08.41]What about a gold one?
[163:17.04]No.
[163:18.40]How about blue again?
[163:19.22]Blue again sounds like not a bad idea.
[163:20.42]I'll do purple again.
[163:25.75]And I'm going to buy a couple of these.
[163:28.21]I know people are going to be freaking out because they don't.
[163:29.83]Don't stop, dude.
[163:30.73]What a waste of money.
[163:31.31]It's okay.
[163:31.53]Let's go for it.
[164:01.71]Reset the save file?
[164:04.45]I don't want to do that.
[164:29.63]More?
[164:53.58]Oh, I had a sweet going, too.
[164:54.80]You guys ruined everything.
[164:55.78]Okay.
[165:03.39]You should add subway surfers to the corner.
[165:07.85]No.
[165:11.27]You're not getting subway surfers.
[165:15.80]Wait.
[165:18.22]Am I going the wrong way?
[165:36.41]Was I going the right way?
[165:37.17]I don't know.
[165:42.83]Was I going the right way?
[165:43.45]What about Family Guy moments?
[165:52.47]No.
[166:18.43]That long staircase.
[166:29.44]Hell's Highway.
[166:30.66]How do I get in there?
[166:32.13]There's a blue orb in there.
[166:36.77]How do I open that?
[166:44.42]It was like mom yelled at us for being too loud and now we're scared.
[166:48.18]The universe just likes to make jokes on my behalf, right?
[166:53.99]An hour before that, two hours before that happened, what did I say?
[166:58.39]What did we talk about very specifically?
[167:00.63]It was incredibly specific.
[167:02.21]What was it?
[167:04.21]It was about audio and how important it is to have proper audio levels.
[167:10.13]And you're telling me that, you're telling me that I may have witnessed a like rare, one in a billion chance bug to create an environment that makes the, huh?
[167:24.84]Today after talking about audio levels, why?
[167:46.35]That's a protagonist dilemma.
[167:52.89]Protagonist dilemma.
[168:09.89]Oh no, here comes a tournament arc.
[168:14.88]What's in here?
[168:24.17]Oh dear, okay.
[168:33.42]Alright, I got that wrong.
[168:42.08]Let's reset it.
[168:53.99]Alright, reset.
[169:05.52]Just delete the explosion sound effect in the game folder.
[169:08.60]God.
[169:24.04]I got it all fucking wrong.
[169:25.42]I mean, so very clearly has to go this way.
[169:50.04]and work backwards.
[169:51.42]That has to go through here.
[169:52.96]So this can exist up from here.
[169:56.49]How does it go this way?
[170:02.77]Unless it has to go.
[170:03.95]No, I can't go from this one to this one.
[170:26.12]It can't be that one, right?
[170:34.24]How do I get it to hit this one here to go up?
[170:50.73]What?
[170:51.41]Wait, hold on a second.
[170:52.53]What is going on right now?
[171:00.42]Wait, what?
[171:04.81]Okay.
[171:09.07]Uh.
[171:11.39]I got it.
[171:23.19]Again, if it was a case of I didn't even know this room existed.
[171:25.97]Okay.
[171:30.02]Wait, is this first part just bait?
[171:32.02]Or can you actually do this part?
[171:35.00]So this is bait.
[171:41.21]Huh.
[171:42.11]That's funny.
[171:44.53]I would have sat here for a long time if I did not see the shadow over there.
[171:56.12]Alright, so I got that.
[172:16.91]Do it again.
[172:28.79]Gone.
[172:29.25]Swing.
[172:49.26]Ooh, that hurt.
[172:49.86]I haven't any money?
[173:09.15]No, but I just bought stuff, so I'm good.
[173:14.94]So where are we now?
[173:15.64]Okay.
[173:17.12]It's time.
[173:24.10]What's in here?
[173:29.29]There are frogs having sex in the pond.
[173:32.49]And they're loud in front of your house or something?
[173:34.57]What was the person talking about?
[173:48.86]Why isn't this working?
[173:50.92]Is there something missing?
[173:53.48]Must more blood be shed?
[173:56.54]You seem to be in a bad mood.
[174:00.16]Dante.
[174:03.76]So, my mother's amulet is the key that unlocks the door to the demon world.
[174:13.11]Good plan, Pop.
[174:14.93]Just the opposite.
[174:17.66]Read genuine advice.
[174:19.47]No.
[174:19.73]Read frog sex.
[174:20.89]Yes!
[174:41.06]Why not?
[174:42.55]After all, we share the same blood.
[174:45.37]I'll just use more of yours to undo daddy's little spell.
[174:50.71]So, you want a piece of me literally?
[174:54.27]Okay, bro.
[174:56.07]Come and get it.
[174:57.97]If you can.
[174:59.05]Okay, here we go.
[175:00.96]You are not worthy as my opponent.
[175:03.54]Dante versus Vergil.
[175:07.76]You could see this exclusive battle.
[175:11.31]Only you pre-order the game now, and get the Dante vs. Vergil DLC pack.
[175:17.84]Included in every copy from pre-orders.
[175:43.96]Okay, well, I had like no health.
[175:53.52]It's the first real attempt.
[175:58.21]Ow.
[175:58.45]Come on.
[176:16.62]Shit.
[176:22.69]You've got a weird move set.
[176:41.70]Oh, what's this?
[176:43.53]Is he going devil mode?
[176:44.59]Devil mode?
[176:55.22]Jesus.
[177:04.91]Ow!
[177:05.53]I feel like I'm playing Street Fighter.
[177:07.00]I feel like I'm caught in a combo.
[177:28.68]No, I can't move!
[177:31.76]Okay, so if you get hit, he's gonna hit you four times in a row.
[177:40.61]Don't get hit.
[177:41.69]Got it.
[178:11.43]Alright, I'm going to wait to go demon mode until you go demon mode.
[178:14.53]That makes more sense to me.
[178:15.39]That hurts.
[178:44.52]Alright, well, I did it early.
[178:46.34]It's okay.
[179:00.79]Alright, so I just gotta avoid it.
[179:01.77]I gotta...
[179:18.00]Come on.
[179:19.68]Oh, fuck.
[179:25.80]Oh my God.
[179:26.72]When you get caught in that, it's over.
[179:45.89]Oh my God.
[179:47.98]You probably have like four frames to hit you with anything.
[179:52.73]You just block it.
[179:55.85]Okay.
[180:16.80]We're going back here.
[180:22.29]I wonder if I should put... No, I like these swords.
[180:26.77]They're leveled up high, too.
[180:33.84]Hmm.
[180:39.66]Regular sword, maybe?
[180:40.42]I haven't used this weapon in a very long time.
[180:55.23]Can I upgrade it?
[180:57.50]I don't even have air hike for it though.
[181:08.75]Turn up your microphone?
[181:10.21]My microphone has been the same for like five years.
[181:12.69]I'll try it.
[181:45.64]Much better.
[181:49.34]Yeah, I was going to run from you now.
[181:50.44]Fuck you.
[181:50.78]Yeah, come get me.
[182:05.75]Coward, I can't hurt him right now.
[182:07.57]I yeah, I'm a coward right now.
[182:08.77]That's fine.
[182:35.03]Whoa, whoa, you transformed and I didn't?
[182:38.67]Fine, let's go!
[182:52.08]Oh, shit!
[183:05.09]No, dude!
[183:05.83]Come on, please!
[183:06.67]NOOOOOO!
[183:39.07]No, that was bad.
[183:44.93]Get away from me.
[183:48.37]I taunted too.
[183:49.13]You baited a taunt, you asshole.
[183:50.86]God damn it.
[183:55.26]No, don't.
[183:56.06]Wait, heal.
[184:00.36]What button is it?
[184:02.08]Up.
[184:02.18]Up.
[184:28.34]What is this horse shit?
[184:30.04]Does he have new moves now with 10% health left?
[184:52.57]Don't!
[185:32.31]No, god damn it.
[185:34.17]I had it too.
[185:35.03]You fucking dickhead.
[185:37.55]You dick.
[185:40.92]I got caught in a combo.
[185:42.10]If you get caught in the combo, he's going to do like three bubbles.
[185:45.16]Fuck.
[186:14.93]I can do it too!
[186:45.63]Alright, that was better.
[187:00.14]That was cleaner.
[187:14.67]Don't even think about it.
[187:20.51]Did we both do it at the same time again?
[187:22.02]Uh oh.
[187:41.91]Ow.
[187:53.19]Goodbye.
[188:28.74]Oh, Virgil!
[188:30.86]Look out for Virgil!
[188:51.32]Get out of here.
[189:07.41]Sorry, but this is no place for a little girl.
[189:09.93]Fuck you for doing that with low volume.
[189:11.36]You don't understand.
[189:27.06]You forced him into this.
[189:29.36]Is that what you think?
[189:31.80]Foolish girl.
[189:49.59]Bravo!
[189:50.93]Bravo!
[189:52.43]I never dreamed that things would go so smoothly!
[189:55.66]Well done, everyone!
[189:57.26]Well done!
[190:05.79]Or you can expect a spanking from daddy later.
[190:09.83]Just as gonna spank your butt, spank you under... Insane buffoon!
[190:13.77]I don't know where you came from, but you don't belong here.
[190:18.66]Now leave!
[190:21.86]Zowie, that was close.
[190:24.42]But you've taken quite a trouncing today, haven't you, Virgil?
[190:27.78]You could have chopped me into confetti by now if you were in tip-top condition.
[190:31.89]Damn you!
[190:34.62]you have lost because you underestimated humans wait what what's going on good girl pure and innocent just like your mother you bastard it's time for your spanking my dear
[191:12.79]He said how many people are in this room?
[191:17.22]Yes, a lot of people in this room right now that weren't here I
[191:31.87]This to you!
[191:36.71]Two amulets.
[191:39.23]A set of Sparda's blood.
[191:42.35]Now, I need one more key.
[191:47.98]He sacrificed two things to suppress the tremendous force of this tower.
[191:55.02]His own devil's blood and a mortal priestess.
[192:02.39]I needed you.
[192:04.32]In whose body flows the same blood as the sacrificed woman.
[192:08.46]The fuck?
[192:10.20]His spell cannot be undone without your blood.
[192:16.08]It was quite a ride, you know.
[192:19.52]If any of you had died before getting here, our little plan would have gone to waste.
[192:25.66]Therefore, my job was to make you battle each other in order to weaken you.
[192:29.47]But at the same time, I had to guide you here and make sure that you were kept alive.
[192:35.51]I even went so far as dressing like a complete idiot.
[192:43.27]It's time for bed, Mary.
[192:45.83]You can visit your dear mother.
[192:56.21]try me it's time for the clown to bow out arkham dude the show's over impressive I expected nothing less from the devil's descendants why does he keep laughing then the spell is broken
[193:20.42]What do you think will happen next?
[193:24.28]Let's welcome chaos.
[193:27.19]He's like, I had to wear this ridiculous costume.
[193:29.29]Like, you don't have to laugh anymore.
[193:33.75]Just sit and wait.
[193:48.20]Wait for the birth of a new god.
[193:52.35]I shall take over the power of Sparda!
[194:14.57]Damn.
[194:15.15]Okay.
[194:23.23]Yes.
[194:24.37]Oh.
[194:26.30]Eh.
[194:28.60]Eh.
[194:30.56]That was pretty ugly.
[194:31.36]It's alright.
[194:37.16]That was pretty ugly.
[195:16.32]Where are we going?
[195:31.96]We're going up to become a god.
[195:58.85]So we're heading into the final arc of the game.
[196:01.34]The last like five or six chapters, right?
[196:11.42]The third act.
[196:12.98]Nice.
[196:13.24]Are you going to go?
[196:23.41]Yes, I'm going to finish him off.
[196:27.50]I think we're safe to turn the game back up.
[196:53.81]Honestly, I'm not using that style move for the Devil Swords though.
[196:58.27]That's the move that I did.
[197:14.51]Getting lured into a false sense of security.
[197:16.69]Oh no, it doesn't say that.
[197:34.48]Alright.
[197:38.14]So.
[197:42.18]Let's try this because I want to see it.
[197:46.66]I want to.
[197:49.79]I can keep these.
[197:50.39]Although maybe I like that better.
[197:53.29]And then.
[197:54.79]What do I got?
[197:57.85]12,000.
[197:57.93]What about one of these holy waters?
[198:01.27]No, no, no, no.
[198:02.69]You know what?
[198:05.23]Fuck it.
[198:18.20]I'm going to do it through here.
[198:19.62]Let me just do one quick thing.
[198:22.79]One quick thing.
[198:38.26]let's go with that and okay see how that works does it sound better is it a little louder I think it can stay right here that better
[199:05.73]Okay.
[199:06.93]So the idea is I turned a certain setting on too over here.
[199:12.83]Just in case.
[199:17.35]This dude is paranoid.
[199:18.55]Yeah.
[199:19.97]I am super paranoid.
[199:22.96]Sacred light.
[199:26.96]Sacred light.
[199:30.28]Do I have that?
[199:35.06]What is that?
[199:40.90]Clash Gauntlets and Greaves.
[199:42.22]The set boosts Dante's attack and speed, making him... Wow, good thing I picked these up.
[199:48.66]I almost just walked completely away from this.
[199:54.39]This is a weapon?
[199:59.15]Really?
[199:59.65]Okay.
[200:12.70]Uh, so that's definitely for that.
[200:13.72]So where's that thing?
[200:19.02]Wasn't there one of those thingies here?
[200:30.02]The Beowulf.
[200:31.70]This is what Virgil was using.
[200:32.64]Okay, cool.
[200:43.22]Okay, so you can hold it.
[200:44.06]Okay, each one can be held.
[200:55.15]What about upgrading it?
[201:00.91]Beast uppercut?
[201:03.39]Straight level two.
[201:07.24]Let's actually take a look.
[201:07.94]I want to see the... What can it do?
[201:17.35]You know, YYY, that's what I just did.
[201:19.33]This one is YY, pause, YY.
[201:22.29]Ooh.
[201:27.59]There.
[201:30.75]Cool.
[201:38.22]Hyper fist.
[201:40.14]Okay, yep.
[201:41.04]So YY, pause, YY.
[201:46.38]Cool.
[201:47.36]I like it.
[201:50.54]I'm a fan.
[201:51.78]Okay.
[201:54.48]Alright, why?
[201:58.12]Pause.
[202:22.87]Nice.
[202:35.01]Yeah, this is a dive kick.
[202:35.85]It's crazy.
[202:36.91]Charging does stupid damage.
[202:38.89]Oh, I'm gonna have fun with it.
[202:46.01]Where we at?
[202:47.44]Okay, so just this one door through here.
[202:51.08]Pretty cool.
[202:53.31]But is there anything else?
[202:58.37]It's a nice weapon for sure.
[202:59.49]We're about to test it probably right now.
[203:04.10]Uh-huh.
[203:09.56]Yep.
[203:10.94]Okay.
[203:13.48]I got that and let's go this way.
[203:20.29]Can you do your own demon boss voice?
[203:22.49]Yeah, I will.
[203:27.75]I will do the next boss.
[203:30.82]I will do all of their dialog.
[203:58.97]And you better believe it's going to be low pitched with a filter on it.
[204:01.51]Get off the walls.
[204:32.04]Stop turtling.
[204:37.91]Okay.
[204:46.66]Where's that door?
[204:50.34]Where's that door?
[205:01.69]wait didn't I just come from here yeah no I did I I don't know Jesus even that was loud
[205:32.84]Are you going to do the food thing?
[205:33.84]Yeah, we'll take a break.
[205:36.98]We'll do the food.
[205:37.60]I got the compilation of the data.
[205:39.27]Okay.
[206:06.27]Whoa!
[206:06.73]So you stop time.
[206:10.83]Now I see why people were saying this is the best move in the game.
[206:55.63]I don't like when they block.
[206:56.53]It's really expensive on BTD, is it?
[207:14.14]Oops.
[207:18.91]Okay.
[207:26.94]Can I do anything else here?
[207:27.94]I wonder.
[207:28.56]No, I just did it.
[207:31.99]Ooh.
[207:42.73]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[207:43.58]There was a... Oh, crap.
[207:50.12]I feel like I missed... There was another way to go over there.
[207:58.21]I think there was, right?
[207:59.21]God damn it.
[208:03.87]It's doing this?
[208:04.73]Okay, it's...
[208:29.84]Restock.
[208:30.88]Restock.
[208:47.86]Okay.
[208:48.72]So I wonder if you get it wrong.
[208:49.78]Do you have to do it again?
[209:06.92]How much is a fully charged punch, do I wonder?
[209:14.33]The dive kick is really good, too.
[209:15.49]Alright.
[209:31.53]It slows down your playstyle a little bit.
[209:34.69]I don't...
[209:37.73]I can't say I love it.
[209:38.89]I'm a lot used to spinning around with the nunchucks.
[209:53.23]Alright, so which way do I actually want to go here?
[209:54.65]This way.
[210:12.70]Alright.
[210:13.14]Swing, swing.
[210:18.30]Okay.
[210:18.62]Well, never mind.
[210:25.41]The dive kick is the best part.
[210:39.82]Okay.
[210:41.00]Uh...
[210:47.83]Everything's open now.
[210:50.11]Um... Anything special I have to do?
[211:11.71]Hmm.
[211:18.60]What do I do?
[211:22.66]This is the only one that's not open.
[211:31.75]This is not open.
[211:36.61]Just leave.
[211:38.33]Go out the door.
[211:39.07]Like just like just leave leave.
[211:49.26]Oh, there is a door.
[211:50.55]Is this?
[211:50.79]I don't know which way I'm going.
[211:55.09]This is wrong, isn't it?
[211:57.09]I don't know what's going on.
[212:00.07]Oh, I found it.
[212:32.06]Back up.
[212:32.86]Watch out.
[212:35.38]Food mode?
[212:35.88]I don't know if this would be a good food mode candidate.
[212:46.51]No, I don't think so.
[212:49.35]This would be pretty low on the scale for food mode.
[212:56.25]I feel like the food mode computer would do way worse than me.
[213:08.92]Alright, so where are we now?
[213:15.36]Interesting.
[213:24.43]I'm saving money.
[213:26.95]I've used way too much on purple orbs.
[213:32.71]But what is... Anything here I can do?
[213:38.11]Wait, what?
[213:48.82]I feel like this moves.
[213:49.66]No?
[213:55.24]Hmm.
[214:12.81]I have no idea.
[214:21.60]Oh, okay.
[214:28.90]What's the end goal?
[214:30.08]Where am I trying to go?
[214:34.53]He went up in the sky and then it was like, okay, now... Oh, I can think over there.
[214:48.83]This looks like I can go up.
[214:54.55]The love planet.
[214:57.74]What the hell is this?
[215:01.24]OK.
[215:02.40]Wait, no, this is back.
[215:08.02]I think I made it.
[215:08.58]Any secrets?
[215:14.56]No.
[215:19.16]Can't use those.
[215:19.82]Alright, goodbye.
[215:39.55]OK.
[215:46.21]Am I going back to the very beginning of the game?
[215:48.04]Yeah, this is like the first area.
[216:01.12]Dante's office.
[216:07.93]Gold orb.
[216:17.06]Wait, no, this way.
[216:27.24]Did I just kill them?
[216:57.52]Alright, die.
[217:07.43]How come he hasn't left the starting area since yesterday?
[217:09.97]I've just been... I don't understand, guys.
[217:12.15]I keep killing the same enemies.
[217:15.31]I don't get it.
[217:15.79]Where am I supposed to go from here?
[217:17.15]I don't understand it.
[217:23.56]There's two.
[217:38.95]Dude, oh.
[217:43.77]Get behind.
[217:59.42]Oh no.
[218:02.50]It's up.
[218:05.46]I'm not doing this whole thing again, no way.
[218:28.13]Why do you have 5,000 times more HP than usual?
[218:30.97]You die already!
[218:50.99]Oof.
[218:54.01]Okay.
[219:01.02]Cool so.
[219:03.66]Is it nothing here?
[219:04.23]I guess I don't understand.
[219:15.44]I didn't accomplish anything.
[219:41.02]What is my goal right now?
[219:54.03]To get to the top of the tower.
[219:55.25]Huh.
[220:27.56]There's another door in here.
[220:28.70]Where's this other door?
[220:47.44]Where is this other door under the stairs?
[220:57.52]Oh, this is, I didn't even blend it in with the environment.
[221:00.14]I couldn't even see this.
[221:16.14]Thank you for watching!
[222:02.19]Do you get to ride the motorcycle?
[222:03.20]That'd be awesome.
[222:37.61]You should get to keep that and use that as a melee weapon.
[222:44.78]Like, what were they thinking?
[222:48.88]T. S. T. C. No!
[222:56.31]I wanted Cs across the board.
[222:57.71]Oh, well.
[223:41.91]Okay.
[223:42.93]The gate crasher.
[223:45.19]Control the tower.
[223:46.15]Control your destiny.
[223:52.33]You still mad about the audio thing?
[223:56.60]I'm still fuming like an hour and 45 minutes later.
[224:03.94]No, I'm alright.
[224:14.36]I'm alright.
[224:14.98]How about a beard cam?
[224:48.29]No.
[224:49.63]Sorry, I was reading something.
[225:08.16]OK.
[225:13.83]Sorry, I'm reading something.
[225:14.83]I'm not.
[225:15.23]I promise I'm reading.
[225:16.05]I'm not reading a guide, I promise.
[225:23.15]I'm not reading a guide.
[225:24.05]Alright.
[225:24.73]Let's go.
[225:33.56]I'm not reading a guide.
[225:34.40]I just looked up tips and tricks for chapter 15.
[225:38.78]That's all I did.
[225:50.96]Hello.
[225:56.52]Oh, it's a mini-boss.
[226:13.81]Oh shit, two mini-bosses.
[226:30.80]You guys are kind of annoying.
[226:41.71]Get over here.
[226:42.43]Oh, these things suck.
[227:16.06]I hate having to jump to enemies and do one move.
[227:27.08]Oh, spiders.
[228:20.27]Oh my... Why do they have to run away?
[228:21.77]Does every enemy run away in this game?
[228:24.17]They all just like go far away from you.
[228:26.95]That's a sin.
[228:29.11]Stop.
[228:40.66]You don't... Whoa!
[228:43.24]You don't level up Quicksilver?
[228:44.26]Okay.
[228:44.54]I should take it off.
[228:49.23]What is happening to my character right now?
[229:06.36]Okay, is this it?
[229:08.22]There are three indentations.
[229:11.54]Okay, this is definitely it.
[229:15.78]Hmm.
[229:23.57]Say the line?
[229:24.37]What line do you want me to say?
[229:33.22]The secret's up there.
[229:45.66]Oh, you want me to say the enemy spider line.
[229:52.42]I can do that.
[229:58.63]Welcome.
[230:00.15]Go that way.
[230:03.48]I just came from that way.
[230:13.48]An energy source has been activated.
[230:15.18]A large snapping sound like two parts locking together can be heard from beyond the wall.
[230:23.81]Okay.
[230:43.93]I don't think I'd do anything with that.
[231:02.56]Okay.
[231:04.63]Um... Um...
[231:16.66]I don't get it.
[231:33.30]Was there something else in this room that I wasn't part of the fucking right camera angle?
[231:37.74]So I have to look at it from a different angle or something?
[232:00.69]What is this?
[232:01.07]Is this just an object?
[232:13.48]No, there's nowhere to go.
[232:14.48]Yeah, I see these two doors, but I don't have the device to turn this on.
[232:21.91]Three indentations.
[232:39.65]What is this?
[232:48.37]A massive force is shaking the tower.
[232:53.36]Have you ever eaten cat food before?
[232:55.04]No, dude.
[232:55.56]I can't say I have.
[232:59.34]You just distracted me.
[233:00.46]What just even happened?
[233:04.08]A loud sound was heard?
[233:05.34]No, I haven't eaten cat food before.
[233:11.91]Did this move or change or no?
[233:13.73]I don't think so.
[233:32.86]Oh, okay.
[233:39.77]Now this is moving.
[233:47.63]Oh shit.
[233:50.21]I want those give it.
[233:51.31]I want those things over there.
[233:53.79]I'm gonna get them.
[234:02.69]This will be interesting.
[234:13.03]Okay.
[234:14.74]The whole tower is rotating.
[234:16.80]Alright, back up.
[234:20.80]Where's that door?
[234:27.01]Oh no.
[234:30.59]No, not right now.
[234:33.77]That would be a mistake to do it here.
[234:36.67]Did it count?
[234:39.90]It counted.
[234:43.61]Oh, jeez.
[234:49.50]I'm making it.
[235:19.79]That's fine.
[235:27.91]He's ignoring us?
[235:28.76]What do you mean?
[235:30.96]Alright, now I go back?
[235:56.38]Does that open this?
[235:59.38]Dude, how am I supposed to... How do you get over this shit reliably?
[236:02.88]Okay.
[236:26.14]12,000, I could do... I'm going to save it.
[236:30.80]Because I want to get... Do I want to upgrade the Beowulf or not?
[236:50.17]I think I actually might just... I like the regular sword a lot.
[236:58.28]Beowulf does a ton of damage, though.
[237:01.68]I'll... I'll do it.
[237:04.72]I'll do it.
[237:05.37]I'm gonna get the, um... I'm gonna get Beast Uppercut.
[237:38.37]Okay.
[237:40.31]So, here we are.
[237:42.69]Activate this last one.
[237:47.09]It does so much damage, though.
[237:48.39]You guys are right.
[237:48.97]Alright, now back in here.
[237:52.37]Is that the line?
[237:59.40]Small or large giant enemy spider.
[238:03.94]There you go.
[238:05.18]Okay.
[238:16.78]This path leads back to the human world.
[238:18.95]To enter the demon world, one must proceed towards the heavens from the central route.
[238:23.43]Okay.
[238:29.52]Um... The central route...
[238:47.36]Oh, back down here.
[238:48.44]I think this is right.
[239:07.87]Yeah, one of these.
[239:09.51]Yeah, this is definitely it.
[239:11.27]Alright, let's test our new move.
[239:14.98]Never mind.
[239:26.77]I'm watching the broken audio clip.
[239:28.17]It's making me literally ache from laughing.
[239:32.13]Well, I'm really glad that you think that.
[239:35.68]I'm glad that you think that.
[239:38.38]I'm still very upset that it happened, though.
[239:41.60]It aches.
[239:42.98]At least as long as somebody... Okay, am I supposed to do that?
[239:57.92]My chest hurts from laughing at it.
[240:00.28]Dude, come on.
[240:02.12]It sucked.
[240:02.96]It was so bad.
[240:04.14]It sounded like your house exploded.
[240:12.75]I can't, man.
[240:19.40]That sucked.
[240:28.85]Oh nice.
[240:35.05]The important thing is we all had fun.
[240:38.19]And that is very important to me.
[240:53.14]Is this right?
[240:59.12]No.
[241:00.48]Is it right?
[241:02.38]I have to go up the tower.
[241:03.22]Maybe it is right.
[241:05.78]No, it's not.
[241:09.47]Is it?
[241:11.79]Isn't?
[241:12.03]So how do I scale the tower?
[241:16.77]Let's find out.
[241:29.05]This guy is actually this bad.
[241:34.46]I know you've probably played this game like 30 times already.
[241:38.66]I don't know where the hell I'm going.
[241:55.73]So I have to go down.
[241:56.85]There has to be a way to go inside.
[241:58.95]Or maybe not.
[242:20.79]Okay.
[242:22.39]Um, did I go in here?
[242:23.59]How many?
[242:24.73]Okay.
[242:29.36]Where do I even go?
[242:30.08]Can I get in here somehow?
[242:33.40]This is one of the most confusing missions in the entire series, to be honest, if not the most.
[242:53.69]Oh, okay.
[243:04.95]I mean, I'm assuming I have to go up the tower, because that's where he went.
[243:12.45]He went up.
[243:18.87]I went that way already.
[243:19.59]I'm going to go the other way.
[243:22.49]It's not really something to do with this, right?
[243:45.03]Okay, I have no idea.
[243:47.13]I feel like I'm close to being in the right spot, but not really.
[243:52.06]This is the really only logical way, right?
[244:04.48]I wish I could delete these enemies from the game and just go in the code and do it myself.
[244:16.21]It's obvious.
[244:17.49]I feel like it's not.
[244:23.03]That's not a door.
[244:32.52]I guess I'm just going to go, but this takes me back to the first area.
[244:43.48]I'm going back to the first part of the game.
[244:51.36]What the fuck am I supposed to do here?
[245:00.97]Maybe I'm supposed to go back that way.
[245:08.33]Go back to the spider room?
[245:14.31]Really?
[245:17.01]Um, okay.
[245:20.54]Have to change gears, maybe?
[245:22.13]I guess.
[245:22.49]Alright, I'm going back to the spider room.
[245:58.47]Okay.
[246:03.40]Back here.
[246:09.78]This is actually pretty far back.
[246:12.82]Okay.
[246:15.11]So I have the... What is it?
[246:17.33]Like a crab in the bottom?
[246:19.21]Bird?
[246:21.75]Mushroom in the top right.
[246:22.67]Okay.
[246:23.37]Red, purple, and blue.
[246:24.37]What side do they have to be on?
[246:30.33]Spin it again.
[246:30.79]Okay, so this is blue in the top left.
[246:44.41]Is that correct?
[246:52.61]There's a couple of sections in the top left that didn't go to.
[247:03.32]You either kind of gotta eat a corn, one corn of kernel at a time.
[247:07.73]I spooned the whole thing in my mouth, bro.
[247:11.29]Come on.
[247:11.53]Okay, this is apparently correct?
[247:19.20]Or different, somehow?
[247:20.20]I think it's different enough.
[247:21.76]Like, if we're doing this again...
[247:43.24]I'm going to die.
[248:05.47]Okay.
[248:05.83]Oh, shit.
[248:06.41]How far back is this?
[248:12.30]Is this really far back?
[248:17.03]Oh no.
[248:20.61]It's not right.
[248:21.59]Where am I?
[248:22.07]No, no, no.
[248:24.55]This is lit up.
[248:35.80]Did he make any progress at all?
[248:37.34]So it's fine.
[248:41.30]I almost like want to just have chat tell me exactly what door to go in.
[248:45.62]We've done that before.
[248:46.34]I don't know if I want to walk in circles for the next hour.
[248:52.54]Alright, so does position matters here?
[248:57.26]Blue is in the top left, purple in the bottom.
[248:59.50]This is where it was before.
[249:00.64]I hit this and I spun it again.
[249:15.09]Now purple's in top left.
[249:20.11]Do I not hit it again?
[249:21.29]I wonder.
[249:26.50]Maybe red in the top left?
[249:36.36]It is not about rotation.
[249:37.46]You need to explore.
[249:43.33]Oh, man.
[249:43.91]Okay.
[249:45.37]Well, where does this take me?
[249:48.97]I remember this part.
[249:52.37]Well, I guess I'm just going to try to go through here.
[249:56.67]I did this last time.
[250:09.10]So where does this go?
[250:11.80]I did not see this yet.
[250:29.83]I didn't make it past?
[250:30.97]Geez, don't do any more sound effect shit.
[250:34.24]That was queuing up for sound effect.
[250:43.79]Alright, so this part... I have two of these now.
[251:01.64]Alright.
[251:04.26]So there's top left area and then top right.
[251:10.56]So I think I have to just go that way.
[251:12.32]So I'm going to try to get to the top right area.
[251:23.01]You missed one of the rotations.
[251:30.44]This is going to put blue in the top left.
[251:43.52]Okay.
[251:44.70]And now this is blue.
[251:45.54]Oh my god, leave me alone.
[251:59.07]Can I even get back up?
[252:02.18]How do I get back up there?
[252:05.06]Oh, you guys are so fucking annoying.
[252:15.14]Right here.
[252:18.36]Oh my...
[252:37.85]What the fuck game?
[252:39.71]Why can I not?
[252:41.21]What the hell?
[252:49.19]Did it still count that I got the fucking item?
[252:52.42]I hope so.
[253:11.83]Okay, here we go.
[253:13.14]Fragment?
[253:14.06]Here's the... Alright, so I need a couple more.
[253:16.54]Okay, so technically I did not do this yet, so I have to go this way.
[253:30.42]Jesus.
[253:46.91]Come on.
[253:48.87]Why can I not jump over this?
[253:51.37]It's fucking horseshit.
[254:09.46]Alright, I need to go in here because I have not technically gone in here.
[254:17.24]Okay, this is the spider room.
[254:25.30]Alright, do I have the whole thing?
[254:26.44]I got the whole thing, don't I?
[254:28.78]I need one more.
[254:35.29]Alright, that last one is definitely down to the lower left.
[254:40.41]I got it.
[254:43.47]Should I spin this again?
[254:47.82]I think I have to spin this again to get red in the top left.
[255:07.33]Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
[255:10.41]Wrong?
[255:10.75]Is it wrong?
[255:13.49]I needed to be... Wait, is that wrong?
[255:23.29]Purple needs to be in the top left.
[255:24.73]I'm alright with people backstating this part.
[255:48.20]Okay.
[255:49.88]And go.
[255:50.08]I can do it this way, but not the other way.
[255:51.30]For some reason.
[256:11.83]Okay.
[256:13.35]Um... This is it.
[256:20.69]I gotta go this way.
[256:21.63]I'm not gonna spin that.
[256:23.83]There should be an item in here.
[256:26.18]And if there isn't, I'm gonna scream.
[256:30.40]There definitely is.
[256:31.20]Ah...
[256:40.59]How do you jump over this?
[256:50.86]I got it.
[256:53.58]Yes!
[257:05.06]I'm stuck.
[257:07.81]Get me the fuck out of that.
[257:09.49]I don't wanna do this again.
[257:19.19]Okay, everything's good.
[257:19.93]We're fine.
[257:28.13]Okay.
[257:30.39]Here we go.
[257:30.93]I have... I'm buying one of these because I don't care.
[257:36.30]I don't want to do this again.
[257:38.46]What's with your title?
[257:39.44]What does it say?
[257:48.68]S-ranked orb collector.
[257:50.70]Pondering wizards in your area with that three... I'm deleting that three phase.
[258:07.89]Okay, now the fun part is I gotta get back to the middle.
[258:11.43]And good luck having me remember how to get the fuck back to the middle.
[258:17.54]It's this way, right?
[258:24.33]I can't die here.
[258:25.31]This is so hard.
[258:31.45]This is the hardest part of the game.
[258:39.55]These jumps, these jumps make no sense.
[258:56.23]Alright, I'm out.
[259:01.59]Now I gotta go... I don't know!
[259:03.53]I don't know!
[259:06.19]I don't know where to go!
[259:07.57]How do I get back to that room?
[259:11.74]I just wanna fuckin' fight the boss!
[259:13.30]I just wanna fight the boss and do fun, cool combos!
[259:49.85]Hey, what are you eating?
[259:50.55]Thank God for food mode.
[259:51.61]Stop.
[259:57.93]I, uh, well, I've got a chicken salad sandwich right here.
[260:00.27]A thing of french fries.
[260:03.61]It's been pretty sick.
[260:04.94]Dude, what the hell?
[260:09.66]How do I get out of here?
[260:10.54]How do I even... Just get me out of this.
[260:22.54]I don't even know what door to go through to get the fuck back to this thing in the middle.
[260:26.47]I need to spin it again?
[260:57.01]Okay, can I play now?
[260:58.65]Can I play the mission?
[260:59.83]Can I please play?
[261:00.93]I don't want to do this.
[261:03.74]I have to eat that.
[261:08.72]I know it's stupid.
[261:09.72]It sucks, but I have to do this.
[261:12.65]I have to eat this.
[261:13.81]I'm sorry, everybody.
[261:14.73]I have to.
[261:26.26]I'm not starting this whole section over again.
[261:40.99]Okay.
[261:42.31]I am now in this room again.
[261:46.87]Is this... I don't even... I don't know.
[262:04.57]Dude, Devil May Cry 3.
[262:07.99]Combos!
[262:08.63]D-d-d-d-d-d-d-a-l-s!

[262:12.67]Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[262:15.79]Rotate the fucking tower, dude.
[262:17.77]Just walk around in a circle for fucking 30 minutes.
[262:26.44]Get out of my way!
[262:28.26]Get out of the- Get out of the way.
[262:30.30]They're ruining everything.
[262:43.60]No, no, no!
[262:44.46]Move!
[262:45.18]What happened?
[262:45.68]Oh... Get... Get away from me!
[262:55.78]If I fell off again, I was about to eat my controller.
[263:07.03]Alright.
[263:07.91]Fuck!
[263:08.83]Get me outta here!
[263:12.99]Okay, we did it.
[263:13.61]We did it.
[263:13.87]We did it.
[263:14.07]We did it.
[263:14.37]I'm here.
[263:14.59]What do you mean, we?
[263:16.07]I know.
[263:16.57]It's... Oh, fuck.
[263:17.61]I didn't make it.
[263:18.31]How do I get out of here?
[263:28.22]Um... And then down.
[263:33.88]And then back around.
[263:37.14]Rotate the wheel, bro.
[263:38.60]I don't wanna...
[263:47.87]Defiant child I don't what did I do it no I have to press I don't wanna Take the teleporter
[264:10.17]Alright, somebody actually helped me out here.
[264:11.79]So now I have the three pieces.
[264:13.01]I need to go teleport back to the casino.
[264:18.34]Walk out the door and then put this in.
[264:21.36]That's correct, right?
[264:24.12]The teleport into the casino is somewhere in this vicinity.
[264:35.87]Get back up those stairs, young man.
[264:43.33]Shut up.
[264:43.61]You're not getting any help.
[264:44.69]Come on.
[264:50.32]I need to go down.
[264:51.40]I don't know.
[264:52.42]I don't know how to get connected over here.
[264:56.42]I wish I could fly.
[265:00.78]Go down, then exit the tower, enter the strip club, and then enter the teleport.
[265:17.71]Ban that guy?
[265:18.33]No.
[265:18.47]Allow that person to stay.
[265:26.76]So, down here.
[265:28.12]And then... I don't... I don't even remember what room the strip club was.
[265:52.64]Is this right?
[265:54.14]I have to rotate this two more times.
[265:58.32]This dude actually bought it.
[265:59.58]Where are you going?
[266:02.56]Do I have to rotate it again?
[266:04.20]Just give up, dude.
[266:17.78]Go rotate it.
[266:32.93]I have to rotate it two more times.
[266:35.87]I will believe you.
[266:36.61]I will trust you.
[266:47.70]Rotate it three times.
[266:51.55]Stop.
[266:54.01]That's the way to get out of here.
[266:55.83]Rotate it three times.
[267:00.17]Somebody just laughed out loud when they heard me say that.
[267:02.85]I did.
[267:06.53]Because I would do it too.
[267:09.85]Alright, rotate this shit's free two times.
[267:14.68]I don't want to go down here and hit this two more times.
[267:18.78]Do it once.
[267:33.17]Twice, twice, twice.
[267:34.35]I'm going to try it once.
[267:59.47]This section is fucking dog shit.
[268:02.11]Sorry what it is.
[268:14.51]Dude, why?
[268:15.81]Please, it shouldn't be that hard to get on here.
[268:38.02]Buy Air Hike?
[268:38.80]I bought Air Hike for a weapon that when I do the special move has a chance, a 1% chance to blow my speakers out!
[268:48.01]I don't want to use that weapon!
[269:10.32]Go.
[269:20.90]Did it happen again?
[269:21.74]No, I just don't want it to.
[269:30.11]He plucks the threads that make us dance finger and toe.
[269:40.34]We surrender, in joy, to the lowest of the foul and rank.
[269:46.66]We submerge through darkness, rancid filth.
[269:51.82]Hour by hour, we move downward, ever closer to hell, in a slow, steady gait.
[270:02.83]Now, let the world resonate.
[270:07.91]Sloth.
[270:10.19]Gluttony.
[270:12.59]Greed.
[270:14.09]Envy.
[270:15.35]Lust.
[270:16.47]Wrath.
[270:18.90]And pride.
[270:22.00]A bell of chaos that tolls human desires.
[270:26.86]After two thousand long years, the once sealed gate to the demonic world will open.
[270:36.41]Destruction!
[270:40.33]Oh no, he's doing an evil villain rant.
[270:42.58]Let your instincts drive you.
[270:44.10]Entrap this world in fear.
[270:45.04]As its very name, Tim and the Gloom, strikes terror at the heart of mankind.
[270:53.08]Then I will become the ultimate ruler of this wasteland.
[271:03.07]Engulfed with pandemonium.
[271:12.63]Alright.
[271:35.12]34 minutes.
[271:35.42]Eh, could have shaved a little time off.
[271:38.37]Could have shaved a little time off there.
[271:54.46]Oh, I didn't save it.
[271:55.80]That's not good.
[271:57.08]I just pressed A. You can still do it here?
[272:18.01]Oh, well, I skipped the cutscene.
[272:30.10]I didn't mean to do that.
[272:35.53]Uh, alright.
[272:39.93]Any, um... If I restart the mission, will we see it?
[272:54.21]Goddammit.
[273:04.73]Uh, I don't know what happened, but we got to the top of the tower.
[273:10.29]Save, save.
[273:11.01]I know, I know.
[273:19.07]Wait.
[273:20.41]Where do I save?
[273:24.39]I can't save from here.
[273:26.11]Save, quit, then reload.
[273:28.65]Save data in the menu.
[273:30.83]Yeah, but I didn't... Everybody told me that this doesn't matter.
[273:35.40]Does it matter?
[273:35.86]I don't know whether to trust this or not.
[273:37.69]People said that mid-mission doesn't really do anything, doesn't it?
[273:44.81]I was told never to use that.
[273:52.80]It doesn't checkpoint, but it does save.
[273:54.30]Okay.
[274:17.04]I don't have to fight.
[274:20.44]I can get the cutscene from the main menu.
[274:21.82]Alright, we actually have to fight now.
[274:39.42]I feel like it's been an hour since I've attacked an enemy.
[275:00.41]Come here.
[275:21.12]Already dead.
[275:21.72]Okay.
[275:32.26]Cool.
[275:38.81]Hey, dude, can you discharge a firearm into your red explosive barrel again?
[275:41.89]It was really funny the first time.
[275:44.59]God damn it.
[275:45.23]I don't want to be the guy that's known as the loud guy.
[275:48.09]Oh, I already am.
[275:58.35]Alright.
[276:00.09]Let's get out of here.
[276:30.89]Things a lot lighter No, is it gone I
[277:01.58]Grrrr!
[277:46.62]Where even is this thing?
[277:48.06]Stay locked on.
[278:08.29]When it goes off screen, I can't see it.
[278:15.97]I'm going for this.
[278:24.62]Hit it!
[278:25.16]Fuck those things!
[278:46.11]Okay, I got an item.
[278:47.29]Boom, stuck.
[279:41.72]Right in the middle.
[279:54.74]Oh, no, I didn't want to press that.
[280:11.15]Living statue room.
[280:12.87]Alright, so I have this item.
[280:17.75]Does the item go in this pedestal?
[280:21.28]No?
[280:22.62]Well, there's plenty of places I haven't gone.
[280:36.63]The question is, what door should I go in next?
[280:41.69]I'm going to say... I have to go this way back into the... Wait, what's in here?
[280:53.98]Okay, so I got to go all the way to the end.
[281:11.60]Now I need to go... Either one of these doors works.
[281:15.34]How much money do I have?
[281:24.77]Not enough.
[281:29.87]Dante versus Deadpool, who wins?
[281:31.41]That's an easy one.
[281:36.45]Probably Dante.
[281:40.09]Okay.
[281:57.30]Alright, good.
[282:13.24]I got to kill this guy now.
[282:14.98]He's annoying.
[282:44.23]Where are you?
[282:45.81]Have you been spawning people?
[283:10.00]Devil Star, ooh.
[283:21.94]Alright, anything else in here?
[283:32.16]Okay.
[283:34.45]So there's another door on the end here.
[283:36.47]Wait.
[283:39.29]Anything over here?
[283:48.48]So this is here.
[283:49.34]Alright, I want to go back and then go to the end of this hall.
[284:01.01]Chamber of Sin.
[284:02.07]He who pursues the Onyx Moonshard make whole the spheres.
[284:11.50]I want that.
[284:35.60]OK, so I don't think you break these.
[284:36.76]Alright, bounce into each other.
[285:12.44]Oh shit, right when it went down.
[285:45.70]What the fuck?
[286:06.87]They're touching!
[286:07.63]Why are they not breaking into each other?
[286:25.25]ah yes I did it moonshard okay cool
[287:08.91]Dude... You... I... I... I hate these things.
[287:15.22]You are so fucking annoying.
[287:24.20]What is... I'm gonna lose.
[287:49.99]OK, well, at least I don't have to do this again.
[288:02.31]I'm just going to do this because I refuse to fight these enemies.
[288:06.98]I refuse.
[288:28.62]Spam the air kick.
[288:30.14]That's what I tried to start doing.
[288:33.17]But they just float around so much.
[288:34.71]You can't even get like a fucking line on them.
[289:10.87]Why can these enemies fly?
[289:12.95]And you shouldn't be able to go on the ground.
[289:34.00]Bro, fight me out of the fucking puddle.
[290:03.79]Right.
[290:05.69]Okay.
[290:06.93]Now I want to go around the corner and down.
[290:23.78]When are you going to start the Granny Game Marathon?
[290:48.21]We were here before, the Ice Guardian's Chamber.
[291:12.49]What?
[291:13.75]What's going on?
[291:18.08]Do I have any thoughts on what?
[291:24.66]Do more attacks than the spinning jump one?
[291:28.46]I know, but... It's... Okay.
[291:31.81]This game, when you move forward and press attack, you do that move.
[291:36.65]You have to stand completely still, which retraining your brain to not have your thumb on the stick is very hard.
[291:42.93]Okay.
[291:56.04]Okay.
[291:59.34]There's a door here.
[292:08.68]I just tried to do that.
[292:43.77]Now where?
[292:48.18]Hey dude, you gonna finish Mafia 3?
[292:53.78]Damn, that's an old one.
[292:58.50]I played Mafia 3 for like three hours or something, didn't I?
[293:17.41]Giant Walker Chamber.
[293:20.57]Yeah, we're really going through the whole first part of the game.
[293:23.73]Okay.
[293:43.98]Here we are.
[293:45.84]This thing is moving now.
[293:59.92]I gotta build up some more souls here.
[294:02.12]Ooh.
[294:13.32]Okay, so this thing's moving.
[294:22.30]Anything weird shit up here or anything?
[294:25.50]No?
[294:34.74]okay only one other way to go oh what's wrong you tired then stand back I'll take care of this no you stand back I told you you can't do it don't you get it this is not a human's job you are the one who doesn't get it it's not something you can reason with
[295:03.64]It has nothing to do with me being a human and you being a demon.
[295:08.34]I'm driven by the inability to forgive him.
[295:11.24]My soul is screaming, demanding me to kill him.
[295:16.85]That's enough motivation to keep me going.
[295:22.35]Besides, this is my family matter.
[295:24.77]You should stay out of it.
[295:27.61]Okay, lady.
[295:28.86]I get the picture, but I can't just sit back and watch either.
[295:32.77]Uh-oh.
[295:32.91]I'm gonna get my ass kicked, aren't I?
[296:03.82]Alright, first try.
[296:04.50]Let me do it.
[296:05.04]I'll get it first try.
[296:13.74]Where is she?
[296:14.20]It's freaking me out.
[296:24.27]Shooting at the voices?
[296:26.25]No, I... Yeah, hers!
[296:47.81]What?
[296:48.70]How are you so good at that?
[297:36.60]Get her caught, get her caught, caught, caught!
[297:38.08]Get her caught!
[298:29.19]You...
[298:43.75]My weapons are so bad.
[298:44.73]Alright, I just need to wait.
[299:19.09]Oh my god, you coward!
[299:28.48]Okay, let's go.
[299:37.48]I can't look up where she is either, I just have to find her.
[299:40.22]Where are you?
[300:09.50]Don't!
[300:09.80]You gotta be shitting me

[301:53.75]Please, just get on.
[302:28.26]I'm just going to wait.
[302:29.92]I'm just going to stand back here.
[302:31.16]I'm just going to run away every time.
[302:47.20]Oh, hi.
[302:47.88]Yeah.
[302:50.93]Oh, sorry.
[302:51.81]I got to go.
[303:16.44]I really don't want to do this again.
[303:17.62]No!
[303:36.66]Okay, thank god.
[303:55.26]I'll take care of him.
[304:02.40]Wait, I did Marge and Homer in the same fight?
[304:05.50]This whole business started with my father sealing the entrance between the two worlds.
[304:11.86]And now, my brother's trying to break that.
[304:14.14]I did the whole family.
[304:14.94]This is my family too.
[304:21.75]Quite frankly, at first, I didn't give a damn.
[304:25.65]But because of you, I know what's important now.
[304:30.23]I know what I need to do.
[304:38.16]Wait.
[304:42.52]Trust me.
[304:43.74]I'll make things right for you.
[304:46.06]That's what my soul is telling me to do.
[304:51.64]Use this.
[304:53.28]How much is it going to cost me?
[304:56.66]You can give me your name.
[304:58.76]Ooh, new weapon.
[305:13.71]Dante.
[305:17.63]Please.
[305:19.72]Free my father.
[305:24.13]I will, lady.
[305:55.31]God damn it.
[305:55.93]I just looked over at the mod chat and I just see mischief makers.
[306:03.17]Did I win?
[306:03.89]Oh, shit.
[306:17.36]Alright, cool.
[306:38.37]Gotta get them all.
[306:40.92]Aww.
[306:53.55]I want that.
[306:53.93]Is it worth it?
[307:10.93]only um what three more chapters alright I need to stop this so
[307:39.42]Take away two minutes that just took me to do that.
[307:46.78]Okay.
[307:50.21]Okay.
[307:50.71]That's a B. One of the reasons I didn't use an item back there is because it was going to be S.
[308:50.48]Uh-oh.
[308:53.15]Combine the aim.
[308:53.93]Oh, do I get that weapon?
[308:55.77]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[309:00.41]Do I actually get to use this?
[309:21.41]Oh, that's Devil May Cry 1.
[309:22.73]Okay.
[309:32.44]I think I want to make a few changes.
[309:35.76]This thing is amazing, but I just don't activate it.
[309:43.30]I think I'll go with Swordmaster.
[309:46.72]And then also...
[309:52.52]I'm curious about this.
[309:53.34]17.
[310:08.01]Getting close.
[310:09.11]There's only, what, 17, 18, 19, 20?
[310:12.75]Only four more?
[310:24.88]Alright, let's go.
[310:26.81]So what's the correct way?
[310:30.39]In the door?
[310:30.87]Yeah, I was there already.
[310:37.35]No, wrong.
[310:44.65]I can go this way, but wait.
[310:57.69]If only I had the double jump.
[311:12.07]Whoa, this is a place to go.
[311:13.15]Trial of the Warrior?
[311:15.63]Okay.
[311:37.34]Alright, let's do it!
[312:01.19]Activated again.
[312:25.16]Alright.
[312:26.84]Oh no, one of you.
[312:48.04]Think I have to activate him again.
[312:48.94]I do.
[312:49.76]That one's, yep.
[313:03.52]Oh shit Don't hurt me Get away from that thing I want to activate it
[313:52.26]I have to turn this on again.
[314:13.90]Haaaaa...
[315:39.08]Really?
[315:46.76]Is he concentrating?
[315:47.70]I am.
[315:48.16]I feel like you have to in a game like this, otherwise you're just going to die.
[315:57.15]Alright, he's going to show up here in a second.
[315:58.45]Alright, fuck you, man.
[316:25.39]Alright, turn it back on.
[316:40.19]Move!
[316:55.44]Alright, now let's get him.
[316:59.97]Do I have to...
[317:37.87]Oh my god, what the hell, dude?
[317:40.86]Why do I have to do this?
[317:43.28]Why can't I just fight the guy?
[318:09.07]Get off of that!
[318:25.77]Oh...
[318:47.15]I'm gonna die.
[318:53.26]How?
[318:54.02]I've hit this guy two or three hundred million times and he's still alive.
[319:15.73]Did you do the million stab?
[319:17.60]I feel like the opportunity for those combos is like close to zero.
[319:21.71]Because I'll get in, I'll be like, here comes the stab, and I'll just get hit.
[319:41.47]How does it pause then spam?
[319:45.25]Yeah, like right here, I can hit him.
[319:46.31]I'm done.
[321:09.05]Where is that piece of shit enemy?
[321:23.81]Okay.
[321:24.65]Shut up.
[322:01.86]Oh my god.
[322:19.44]That's it.
[322:42.15]Oh my god.
[322:44.93]I fucking hate this thing.
[322:46.91]This is so awful.
[323:02.53]This is awful.
[323:07.02]I'm dead.
[323:21.58]It's optional?
[323:22.58]Well, I have to beat him right there.
[324:11.28]Stop using weak weapons.
[324:12.88]There's only five in the game.
[324:14.12]I'm using two of them.
[324:37.38]Come here.
[324:40.93]Alright, Harry, alright, come on!
[324:42.57]Alright, how many times are you gonna do that?
[325:49.15]I don't want to grab a hold of that thing.
[325:50.99]Get away from me!
[326:13.73]No!
[326:24.18]Get out!
[326:32.26]Die!
[326:39.91]How could you still be... How could you still be alive?
[326:43.41]How is it... How could you still be alive?
[326:44.89]It's not even possible.
[327:05.95]Oh, dude.
[327:27.74]Die!
[327:32.31]Hit the wheels if I go to the wheels he goes It's just as it again sucks
[328:27.13]Okay, I'm going to save everything to the very end.
[328:46.34]I don't like that if you just touch those, they just do it.
[328:57.30]So, can somebody... Are they invincible if these are both not active?
[329:11.24]Okay, let's go.
[329:12.20]You fucking asshole.
[329:57.74]Get away from me for one second, dude!
[330:04.66]Don't!
[330:04.90]He's gonna do it again!
[330:05.68]Oh!
[330:05.74]Oh my god!
[330:24.84]Just... You... Open it!
[330:41.02]Let me just turn it on!
[330:42.45]Dude, I keep getting trapped in front of him!
[330:56.92]I don't even have any heals.
[331:12.27]I don't have any heals.
[331:13.31]I have to do this.
[331:23.51]What the hell is this enemy?
[331:25.94]And why is it like this?
[331:26.86]You don't even have an opportunity to attack this motherfucker before he just like decides to start teleporting around again.
[331:34.08]I just didn't want to die.
[332:01.14]Just walk behind him?
[332:07.03]Overtuned.
[332:08.09]Overtuned.
[332:09.11]Overtuned.
[332:10.25]Overtuned.
[332:11.45]Overtuned.
[332:11.99]Yeah, I know he's invincible, but there is not a single opportunity where I can go turn on two fucking pirate wheels.
[332:26.58]He just doesn't stop attacking.
[333:20.19]I'm going to turn the other... Turn the other pirate wheel.
[333:42.23]I can't dodge correctly.
[334:13.98]He does this move way too often.
[334:17.12]Way, way too often.
[334:18.62]He does this move ten times too often.
[334:34.17]And now the thing's back to zero again!
[334:35.88]This is awful!
[335:07.32]Sucks absolute asshole.
[335:08.82]It really does.
[335:09.44]There's no opportunity to fight this guy.
[335:20.89]You're either smacking a wheel or he's teleporting around the whole map and just screaming at you.
[335:27.42]Here we go again.
[335:46.76]Just admit you can't do it.
[335:50.14]It's a skill issue.
[335:51.24]It's a game issue!
[336:04.78]So how much less damage do I actually do to people?
[336:15.93]I feel like I should have killed that guy by now.
[336:24.79]I mean, that's an unbelievable reduction in how... These guys... I'm hitting the same guy.
[337:04.03]I have an idea Does every single enemy in this game have to have teleport?
[337:18.20]Do they have to put that in for almost every enemy in the game?
[337:36.15]Teleport, see you later.
[337:37.45]Alright, he's back, oh my.
[338:15.56]Why does he parry every move in the front?
[338:18.46]And then he teleports.
[338:20.38]Fuck this guy.
[338:42.40]Dude, stop appearing underneath me.
[338:44.48]And then I...
[338:57.94]This is so bad.
[338:59.02]This is bad.
[339:22.77]Where is he going?
[339:26.53]Fuck this guy and fuck this game!
[339:28.85]I'm killing him right now!
[339:52.45]This is unbelievably awful.
[339:56.59]On a scale of 1 to 10, this is at least an 8.
[339:58.53]This is at least an 8.
[340:18.70]Why do they have to teleport every single three seconds?! !
[340:25.06]Do they have to teleport after every swing?
[340:27.98]After every fucking swing?
[340:29.72]I can't, but I'm so done.
[340:41.15]And I just replaced the thing that I just used.
[340:45.17]So it was for no reason to come in here.
[341:15.83]Oh, okay.
[341:42.55]Here comes another mauled city.
[341:45.36]Oh no.
[341:49.94]I'm gonna be fine.
[341:50.86]I'm gonna be fine.
[341:54.86]Don't worry.
[342:14.40]Let's go.
[342:17.14]Not another one.
[342:40.25]Where are you?
[343:04.59]Move!
[343:05.94]I feel like I'm in sludge half the time.
[343:41.80]Is that it?
[343:50.03]Alright.
[343:51.61]Are you going to have a breakdown?
[343:55.51]No, I'm good.
[343:57.45]I'm good.
[344:01.58]So where the hell am I going?
[344:11.81]Alright.
[344:13.97]I have to put the loud weapon on.
[344:16.81]I feel like I was better with it.
[344:18.27]I just have to be careful.
[344:24.85]Or maybe the Beowulf.
[344:26.67]Maybe.
[344:26.91]Okay.
[344:38.74]I have 20,000.
[344:45.79]Uh, I think it's air hike.
[344:47.79]But... What's this?
[344:59.60]Yeah.
[345:02.20]Okay.
[345:09.31]So it's... Why?
[345:10.97]Why?
[345:11.13]Pause.
[345:11.55]And then... There it is.
[345:13.35]Okay.
[345:13.51]Okay.
[345:18.24]This dude bought air hike twice.
[345:19.94]I don't know what I'm doing.
[345:22.00]Yeah, but I don't want to use those swords anymore.
[345:40.41]Um.
[345:43.21]Do I want to keep this on?
[345:48.90]Where do I want to go?
[345:49.86]Back to Trickster?
[345:50.50]I feel like Trickster is very helpful.
[346:05.41]I think that's the right call.
[346:17.21]There we go.
[346:17.63]Nice.
[346:23.20]Okay.
[346:26.98]From here, there's nowhere else to go.
[346:30.00]Okay.
[346:35.88]I guess we're going back.
[346:55.01]Gotta go back up the cubes.
[347:18.82]This is not as bad as you guys think it's gonna be for me, I promise.
[347:28.75]I know a lot of you are expecting.
[347:29.93]Oh wow, I can't wait.
[347:30.67]He's gonna fuck up everything.
[347:31.74]I'm gonna be alright right here.
[347:34.90]So far so good.
[347:48.94]Done.
[348:00.37]Weird, okay.
[348:02.97]I can go up here.
[348:26.90]It really is the horror.
[348:44.21]Okay.
[348:47.07]Now, there was a trick to this.
[348:48.17]It was four.
[348:53.55]Oh.
[348:58.57]Do I need to do this, though?
[349:00.47]I feel like I don't need to do this.
[349:01.99]But I guess I'm... Oh, my God.
[349:07.82]Wow.
[349:22.53]I got really lucky there.
[349:23.39]Ooh.
[349:38.83]Did I do it?
[349:51.05]Alright.
[349:53.23]We're getting close.
[349:58.47]Do I need to fight these?
[349:59.05]Maybe not.
[350:01.01]I do.
[350:34.70]You're in for a cool boss fight?
[350:36.86]I'd love to hear it!
[350:45.44]Is it Y, pause, Y, Y?
[350:47.10]Or is it Y, pause, Y, pause, then that?
[350:50.51]Okay, that's that.
[351:12.48]It's why, why, why, why, why?
[351:13.68]Pause.
[351:14.18]Why, why, why, why, why, why?
[351:18.30]Good to know.
[351:24.98]Alright.
[351:28.48]Back onto the big bridge.
[351:35.24]This is fine.
[351:35.88]Keep going.
[351:53.57]Alright.
[351:54.05]Let's do it.
[352:24.31]Time to fight my shadow.
[352:39.96]This would be easy.
[352:43.10]Are you learning from all my moves?
[352:44.96]Because I got a D in every single level, so this should not be hard at all.
[352:57.51]Oh, I can't hurt him.
[353:02.94]Oh, you don't like the light.
[353:04.54]Okay, I get it.
[353:05.36]Go over to the light.
[353:07.46]Let's light this place up.
[353:51.91]Dude, you've ripped his skin off.
[353:56.67]I didn't do anything.
[354:06.62]No, you come to me.
[354:07.34]I wasn't locked on.
[354:22.07]I was holding Bright Trigger.
[354:57.23]Big damage, that's right.
[355:07.80]No!
[355:17.57]Come on, really?
[355:18.35]Did I actually waste it?
[355:27.75]That wasn't bad.
[355:37.96]Thought I lost my shadow for a sec.
[355:57.16]Oh no.
[356:03.00]Oh, yes.
[356:09.33]Doppelganger.
[356:10.61]Special power used by the doppelganger enemy.
[356:13.51]The style gives you more freedom to battle.
[356:15.19]Another style.
[356:16.99]Okay.
[356:25.44]Give me a couple of new things to mess around with here.
[356:28.52]Right at the end of the game.
[356:31.22]Oh.
[356:50.06]What is getting worse and worse?
[357:04.06]40 minutes.
[357:04.86]Well, it was 40 minutes because I spent at least 25 doing that stupid wheel encounter.
[357:09.31]18.
[357:09.33]Invading Hell.
[357:10.29]Break the seal and battle into the depths.
[357:53.14]Whoa.
[358:13.71]Have to fight the whole chessboard.
[358:15.11]Do I have any pieces?
[358:25.05]Yeah.
[358:43.02]Lock on to this thing.
[358:55.29]If they get to the end of the board, do I lose?
[358:57.09]I feel like that's what it's implying here.
[359:40.82]Everybody, come on!
[360:10.68]That hurts so much.
[360:31.12]GET IT!
[360:44.59]Dude, does everything have to have a move that goes and then dashes across the screen?
[361:16.61]OK.
[361:21.31]I just have to... I'm going to stay in the fists.
[361:27.34]There's way more damage.
[361:29.82]I got to clear them out as fast as possible.
[361:31.72]Starting, go one, two, three.
[361:33.14]What side happens first?
[361:34.16]I just can't.
[361:45.27]Bombo just gets broken.
[361:46.25]I wish I had like some kind of...
[362:13.36]Don't lock on to random shit that's in the way, please.
[362:20.71]Okay.
[362:21.89]Uh-huh.
[362:24.29]Uh-huh.
[362:27.95]I still got hit by it.
[362:43.17]Yeah.
[363:15.19]Alright, who's left?
[363:16.23]You.
[363:39.68]Just come over here already.
[364:03.78]Dude, check this tutorial.
[364:05.64]This is fucking crap.
[364:07.50]This is crap.
[364:09.33]This is crap.
[364:11.17]I can't.
[364:24.14]That's what dad says.
[364:29.58]Can you give dad the controller for like GTA or something?
[364:33.51]I drive all the time.
[364:34.97]He's going 20 miles per hour down every single road.
[364:38.43]He's hitting every single car.
[364:40.43]He doesn't get it.
[364:41.02]He just goes, son, this is crap.
[364:46.32]This is crap, son.
[365:13.71]Holy shit.
[365:14.57]I did it.
[365:22.65]This is crap.
[365:34.66]No.
[365:36.28]Yeah.
[365:36.42]At least watch the rest on YouTube.
[365:52.67]Okay.
[366:02.17]I'm curious about it.
[366:09.50]What is, oh, okay.
[366:12.42]You want me to do this now?
[366:34.29]Probably not a great weapon for this.
[366:46.70]so so
[367:15.81]Alright, this is what I wanted to do!
[367:16.75]How did I not hurt him at all?
[367:49.80]Why do I call on the other Dante?
[368:09.55]No, they're still coming in ice.
[368:29.32]Changing the targets makes me want to throw up.
[368:59.02]I'm gonna lose.
[369:00.14]Oops.
[369:28.48]Okay.
[369:29.74]I see a couple things wrong already.
[369:34.17]These weapons are not for this fight.
[369:37.25]We're putting on these.
[369:47.14]And I want... I want this.
[369:57.60]I was burping.
[369:58.44]I wasn't crying.
[370:19.07]Way better.
[370:39.11]Wait, I'm hearing those explosions again and it's kind of freaking me out.
[371:12.04]Whoa!
[371:18.71]We did it!
[371:39.99]Only got to kill like four more of those, or way more than that.
[371:45.81]Don't have to kill every single boss in the game.
[371:47.27]This is going to stink, isn't it?
[371:51.64]This is going to stink.
[371:54.92]Who's this one?
[371:59.26]Oh no.
[371:59.44]Oh no.
[372:26.85]Are you gonna beat the game tonight?
[372:28.14]I plan on it.
[372:29.20]I'm gonna try to.
[373:12.56]Gotta hit these guys in the back too.
[373:14.69]It's just... It's... It's just... It's... You know what I mean.
[373:19.15]Like...
[373:50.95]This is crap.
[374:16.59]One move, Andy.
[374:17.35]It's the only move I can do.
[374:19.09]They just run so far away.
[374:20.61]They jump around, dash around.
[374:22.23]I have to hit them.
[374:25.60]They just back, back up, back up.
[374:29.76]Fight me.
[375:02.66]He's Royal Guard.
[375:04.31]Idiot.
[375:08.45]Time that person off for one second.
[375:50.44]Don't even start.
[376:13.70]Yes.
[376:18.42]Alright.
[376:25.95]Who's the worst boss that I don't want to fight right now?
[376:31.65]Okay.
[376:35.52]I don't want to fight her right now.
[376:40.28]What's this one?
[376:45.85]Dude, did I pick the right one?
[376:47.33]Fight Jim and you're done?
[376:48.21]What do you mean I'm done?
[377:04.30]Am I actually done if I do this?
[377:18.58]I forget the combo for this.
[377:25.91]Way too slow.
[377:40.14]Y space, Y space, Y, okay.
[378:34.89]I'm dead
[379:18.97]God damn it.
[379:28.36]Damn it.
[379:35.16]Ah, unfortunate.
[379:36.04]I have a question.
[379:41.29]If I use this orb, I come back.
[379:45.73]If I die here and I reset, do I have to fight the other two bosses in a row?
[379:52.39]Very important distinction.
[379:58.87]No.
[379:59.13]Okay.
[380:01.15]Thank you so much.
[380:01.88]Appreciate the tip.
[380:11.62]Whoa.
[380:15.50]Who's this one?
[380:18.19]Oh, I can do this one.
[380:18.95]This one's easy.
[380:50.80]That's taking way more hits now.
[381:07.18]They're all buffed up.
[381:08.48]Ah.
[381:17.61]Damn it.
[381:35.16]Really?
[381:48.45]You don't even get a combo in.
[382:02.16]I didn't get it?
[382:02.76]Shit.
[382:05.40]Really?
[382:05.76]Twice in a row I didn't get it?
[382:06.98]That's annoying.
[382:15.21]I'll get it this time.
[382:27.97]What a waste.
[382:31.75]What a waste.
[382:46.52]I can cancel it.
[382:48.34]I didn't even know that till literally the last 10 minutes of the game.
[383:00.15]How come he keeps flipping back?
[383:02.65]When do I get the opportunity to actually attack him?
[383:30.53]All the lights gotta be up.
[383:38.34]Why even attack him here?
[383:39.76]I shouldn't even do it.
[383:41.16]Get all the lights.
[384:08.47]He shot a beam.
[384:09.27]I thought he turned it off across the way.
[384:10.63]He threw it.
[384:12.89]He did his move.
[384:14.07]He threw the projectile.
[384:15.61]I thought he turned it off.
[384:23.95]Yeah, he did that.
[384:25.10]What, does it just disappear if you actually turn all the lights on?
[384:33.84]I'm one of the health.
[384:44.95]Don't throw?
[384:45.49]I won't.
[384:45.75]Come over here.
[385:04.66]Okay, we got him.
[385:13.74]15k?
[385:20.97]Nice.
[385:24.55]Any more heals?
[385:25.13]I don't want to go in this with half health.
[385:35.48]I wonder if there's any more.
[385:41.90]Who's this?
[385:42.75]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[385:43.61]I thought this was a giant one.
[385:45.43]I was like, oh, cool.
[385:46.39]What's this big one?
[385:47.19]I think I should just die here.
[385:52.51]Just kill me.
[385:53.98]Because I just want the full health to fight the white dork.
[386:06.95]If I just have to do the white one, then is there a point to do all of them?
[386:11.55]Or no?
[386:16.86]I'm going the wrong way.
[386:20.96]Was I going the wrong way?
[386:27.00]Go.
[386:27.06]You'll get more red orbs.
[386:32.12]Let's just get this guy.
[387:00.52]Come on, man.
[387:20.10]I didn't want to even dodge towards him again, but you know how it is.
[387:57.10]I got so greedy.
[387:58.34]And I still am greedy.
[387:59.48]Fuck it.
[388:18.86]Where is he?
[388:19.90]No!
[388:27.90]Ha!
[389:08.84]Go, go, go, go, go.
[389:12.78]Thank God.
[389:21.12]Alright, I did it.
[389:21.84]I was gonna say that's not a lot.
[389:34.15]So that's three.
[389:38.33]I've made a circle.
[389:45.01]Well, I'm really glad you guys told me that because I definitely would have tried to fight every single enemy in this game.
[389:58.92]Circle like it connected them in a, you know, whatever.
[390:01.54]I'm tired.
[390:02.48]I'm tired.
[390:23.22]Fighting this guy now?
[390:23.90]I feel like I'm going to have a great time.
[391:11.74]Alright, this is 19 out of 20.
[391:23.34]How do you eat blue cheese?
[391:24.34]It tastes like puke.
[391:31.79]How do you eat goat cheese?
[391:32.79]It tastes like dirt.
[391:34.89]I can say that too.
[391:47.47]Popple the Great Beast with Fate's Bullet.
[391:55.19]The Great Beast.
[392:31.94]Alright, where's the great beast?
[393:00.21]26,000, damn.
[393:56.18]New zone?
[393:56.96]Alright.
[394:00.84]It's just a gauntlet.
[394:09.03]I can't hit these guys.
[394:12.31]What is...
[394:15.73]substance projects image and image punishes substance do I have to hit them in the mirror huh
[394:51.70]Excuse me.
[394:57.69]Stop the vicious circle by bending time and space.
[394:59.85]Looks like something can be inserted here.
[395:16.92]Something can be inserted here?
[395:24.43]Did I just enter the mirror opposite this one?
[395:45.28]Stop the vicious circle by bending time and space.
[396:01.96]Did I do it?
[396:02.30]Did I do it more than once?
[396:43.11]Another one.
[396:43.55]Ooh.
[396:45.47]27,000.
[396:45.49]I need a kiosk or whatever they are.
[397:03.29]Can't hurt them.
[397:17.97]Okay.
[397:23.53]Oh, I can hurt them.
[397:24.31]Alright.
[397:45.65]Here we go Not bad
[398:29.41]Did I do it?
[398:30.97]I got it.
[398:44.16]I failed it?
[398:48.08]Really?
[398:48.78]Okay, hold on.
[399:15.98]Dude, how many more combos?
[399:44.74]Die already!
[399:45.66]God damn it!
[399:50.24]Die!
[399:50.58]Please!
[399:58.17]Is he dead?
[399:58.59]Did I do it?
[400:02.03]Oh, yes.
[400:02.45]I had a triple S going almost that whole time.
[400:10.41]It still took him almost to the end.
[400:20.69]I wonder what the last boss is.
[400:25.12]I bet it's a cube.
[400:49.61]Alright, it's time.
[401:01.08]It's time to upgrade one more time.
[401:08.37]One more blue orb.
[401:11.99]Or get a gold orb.
[401:13.37]I think this is going to be a big deal.
[401:20.27]This is what I would do.
[401:30.95]And then get stream level two.
[401:39.67]You already had one.
[401:45.16]I can't resurrect twice.
[401:54.28]Yeah, you can.
[401:55.10]Yeah, I'm just giving myself some padding.
[402:07.77]I mean, this is the correct answer, right?
[402:09.59]I guess I could do another blue orb or that.
[402:13.65]What do you think?
[402:18.03]Blue orb or level two?
[402:20.91]Part two of that.
[402:32.76]Okay, gotta heal now.
[402:40.64]This is it, right?
[402:44.44]The road to despair.
[402:45.56]This is not right.
[402:52.43]Go in the mirror?
[402:54.99]Wait.
[402:59.91]Didn't I come out of that mirror?
[403:08.47]I came out of that one, didn't I?
[403:09.43]Oh shit, OK.
[403:28.99]So.
[403:31.39]Not here.
[403:31.87]Go back in the mirror.
[403:36.75]I just went in the mirror.
[403:41.91]Wait, what is... Again?
[403:45.53]Wait, how much... Oh.
[403:59.30]Oh, okay.
[404:04.65]Statue?
[404:05.23]I have... I need to put the thing in the... I...
[404:17.15]I feel like that was 100 years ago.
[404:26.76]Okay.
[404:27.36]Alright.
[404:29.14]Now we go back in here.
[404:29.94]End of the line.
[404:33.56]Alright.
[404:43.31]I already spent things.
[404:44.89]Cool.
[404:45.55]Okay.
[405:00.89]I know boss maybe it's like staring into a backed up toilet why do you always stick your nose in other families business come on dude don't you have any hobbies
[405:46.30]Okay.
[405:54.57]Big giant enemy.
[405:55.41]I'm imagining you'll attack big giant enemy's legs.
[406:00.03]Big enemy will fall down.
[406:01.03]Hit enemy in face.
[406:03.17]Okay.
[406:10.30]Alright, let's do it
[407:01.08]Not bad damage.
[407:02.02]We're good.
[407:07.04]Jesus!
[407:07.44]Do I have to attack these?
[407:10.21]What are they doing?
[407:13.91]They're about to fucking snipe me.
[407:47.38]Alright, I got some good healing out of that.
[408:17.76]Your loadout is ass.
[408:19.61]I'm busy.
[408:22.94]I'm a little busy right now.
[408:48.22]Dude, what is the strategy here?
[409:02.00]Rocket?
[409:03.06]Oh my god, okay, well, that was fun.
[409:22.91]I tried to hit select to open up the fucking menu.
[409:38.59]It's up on the D-pad and I have not been able to put that into my memory.
[409:43.52]It's the only game in history that's ever had up on the D-pad be go to the menu.
[409:47.70]There hasn't been a single game in history that's done that.
[409:51.62]In all of history.
[410:37.84]Okay Alright, bring out the bugs again or whatever the hell they are
[411:33.54]Okay.
[411:45.19]Why would I ever be locked on to that?
[411:47.33]Are you fucking serious?
[411:49.17]Why would it lock on?
[411:50.73]And I don't even kill it.
[412:08.67]Because when you lock on, you... You know what I was going to... Whatever.
[412:30.95]Where you at?
[412:41.49]Did I win?
[413:06.92]I've come to retrieve my power.
[413:10.58]You can't handle it.
[413:17.69]Look at you.
[413:18.85]Making a big dramatic entrance and stealing my spotlight.
[413:22.63]What?
[413:24.33]You don't possibly believe that he deserves to be our main event now.
[413:29.49]Now that you mention it.
[413:32.85]You're right.
[413:33.43]Do we get to play together?
[413:34.29]Can I switch between them?
[413:40.91]Battle of brothers.
[413:44.41]Okay.
[414:08.55]Virgil follows Dante's lead, but still spins off his own special style.
[414:14.47]So B is Virgil?
[414:16.03]Okay.
[414:18.75]So no more demon form.
[414:20.79]Oh my god, I'm almost dead.
[414:21.67]Go.
[414:35.30]Oh, I don't have a dodge anymore.
[414:50.10]I got this Virgil, watch out!
[415:10.11]Go!
[415:22.88]That hurt a lot.
[415:33.67]Not more of this shit again.
[415:56.63]How is it possible to miss?
[416:00.19]There's six pixels where you can't hit one of those things.
[416:04.19]And I found it.
[416:04.88]Uh-oh.
[416:18.56]What?
[416:19.08]Am I Virgil?
[416:24.12]I'm coming back.
[416:25.52]Virgil, don't worry.
[416:26.24]I'm coming back.
[416:28.11]I have the free-to-play currency.
[416:29.51]I love this one of these little shits just still here.
[416:53.16]Oh my god.
[416:54.78]Please, just end it.
[417:00.91]Virgil, do a fucking suplex.
[417:24.09]Hey, hey, hey!
[417:25.49]Put me down!
[417:26.31]Hey, hey!
[417:29.21]What?
[417:29.95]Hold on, I'm so, what happened?
[417:31.79]You shitting me?
[417:32.59]I didn't know that's what was going on.
[417:35.80]No, Virgil, get over here!
[417:38.84]Turn around right now!
[417:41.12]Attack him!
[417:46.72]I didn't know that's what was happening.
[417:48.92]Oh my God, please.
[417:56.82]How did you fall for it again?
[417:57.88]Dude, I had one HP when he picked me up the first time and it killed me instantly.
[418:42.25]Oh no.
[418:43.79]Jackpot.
[419:13.33]Not very classy for someone's dying words Oh the sword there it is
[419:46.99]Oops.
[419:49.39]DSCDC.
[419:53.45]Well, whatever it is, I'm incredibly unprepared for it.
[419:59.08]Considering I just had to use two of those golden orbs.
[420:02.87]I hope this final encounter is the same encounter that Capcom puts in all their games, which is just aim the rocket launcher at the big scary thing and press A.
[420:51.66]Turn back to the Jester.
[420:52.62]This is actually the hardest fight in the franchise coming up here.
[421:08.35]Oh, no.
[421:11.71]What a surprise.
[421:13.82]Here I was looking for you.
[421:15.94]And lo and behold, you come to me.
[421:19.83]Oh, this is going to be... I got it.
[421:21.79]Don't ever call me that again.
[421:23.85]I'm not going in with a negative attitude.
[421:25.55]It's not happening.
[421:27.07]Wait.
[421:27.23]Please.
[421:27.77]Do you really want to shoot me?
[421:35.19]Can you shoot me?
[421:37.53]Your own father.
[421:42.29]What have I done wrong?
[421:44.37]Even the heroic Sparda sacrificed a woman so that he could become a legend.
[421:49.90]I wish to be a god.
[421:53.22]And I sacrificed one miserable human being for that reason.
[421:58.76]That is all.
[422:00.70]Was that really so awful?
[422:05.49]I have some unfinished business to take care of.
[422:09.65]Alright, I'm going to try to do a world record here for this stream.
[422:16.94]No complaining for 10 minutes.
[422:19.64]That would be a world record in a hard game.
[422:22.75]No complaining for 10 minutes straight.
[422:32.21]Can you bet on that?
[422:33.51]Yeah, sure.
[422:34.82]I'll try as hard as I can.
[422:37.89]I will not complain.
[422:39.43]Will I complain?
[422:41.34]And by the way, me saying, what the fuck is that?
[422:43.44]What is this move?
[422:44.64]Oh, this is bullshit.
[422:47.20]No, we're talking about, I have to sincerely be like, and why does he teleport?
[422:51.06]That's not fair.
[422:52.30]Why does he have a dash?
[422:55.09]All in or no?
[422:55.85]Okay, fine.
[422:57.99]Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[423:00.77]I will not make a single complaint.
[423:03.27]I'm going to be super happy the whole time.
[423:07.49]You can run a poll if you want.
[423:08.95]For ten minutes.
[423:10.59]In ten minutes and one second, I have completed the challenge.
[423:21.22]You have to eat a BLT on stream if you complain.
[423:23.64]Okay, yeah, that sounds fun.
[423:30.27]Yeah, ten minutes.
[423:36.03]okay oh I only have 15 000. no it's I don't have enough I've wasted that other one I didn't I didn't know that was it I have to buy these no no no no no that we haven't started yet
[424:00.75]We haven't started yet.
[424:02.97]Well, this is free money, if you just are curious.
[424:05.91]This is a free channel point increase to whatever you have.
[424:08.26]Because there's no way, right?
[424:09.42]Like, I just, I forgot.
[424:11.84]No, no, no, no, no.
[424:12.90]Is that it?
[424:17.44]Is it in?
[424:18.02]Are we good?
[424:20.60]That wasn't a complaint.
[424:21.50]That was me expressing my sadness.
[424:26.41]Okay.
[424:26.53]Okay.
[424:43.57]Okay.
[424:50.02]I know I'm going to buy one of these.
[424:54.36]And I know I'm going to buy one of these.
[425:04.98]People are going all in.
[425:06.40]Oh, boy.
[425:09.74]Yeah.
[425:10.56]The timer can start from...
[425:14.23]When the inevitable cutscene here ends and the actual boss health bar is on the bottom of the screen.
[425:21.18]That is when you can start the timer.
[425:23.16]When boss's health bar is the bottom of the screen.
[425:28.58]Good luck.
[425:33.84]If you lose again, if you lose this, you have to eat salt and vinegar chips as well.
[425:39.47]That's fine.
[425:39.85]Yeah.
[425:40.79]BLT.
[425:42.23]Those chips.
[425:42.77]Yeah.
[425:46.43]Sounds like a good lunch.
[425:49.81]And goat cheese?
[425:50.53]No, I refuse.
[425:51.77]I will turn the stream off.
[425:53.37]I will run from that.
[425:56.99]We're not going goat cheese yet.
[425:58.41]It's only been 10 minutes.
[425:59.81]Alright.
[426:03.75]Here we go.
[426:08.43]I am going to use the weapons I have right now.
[426:10.07]I am going to keep the trickster.
[426:16.65]Let's go.
[426:35.36]When I play hard games like this, I feel like half of my sentences are complaints.
[426:41.50]This is going to be rough.
[426:46.20]Well, I want yours too.
[426:49.28]What are you going to do with all that power, huh?
[426:52.64]No matter how hard you try.
[426:54.28]Yeah, wait till the gameplay starts.
[426:55.18]We're not going yet.
[426:55.78]You're wasting time.
[427:08.69]We are the sons of Sparta.
[427:11.67]Within each of us flows his blood.
[427:15.94]Don't even talk.
[427:17.08]Ten minutes is a long time.
[427:20.40]What is it right now?
[427:20.92]It's 1041 Pacific.
[427:21.32]Twins.
[427:46.70]Okay, here we go.
[427:48.98]Begins now.
[427:49.38]Timer starts now.
[428:03.62]It almost just happened.
[428:33.25]No, I'm not muted, I promise.
[428:36.03]He has health back?
[428:40.70]Just asking a question.
[428:42.14]I was asking if he has his health back.
[428:44.16]It was a question.
[428:46.80]I was asking if he heals.
[428:48.12]That's not... No, it's not.
[428:50.14]I'm fine.
[428:50.66]I was just like thinking, wait, does he have his health back?
[428:52.85]Is this a heal mechanic?
[428:55.77]That's all that was?
[429:15.83]Oh, he's in demon mode
[430:05.80]My turn.
[430:24.84]Getting really hard to not.
[430:26.64]It's so difficult right now.
[430:28.06]I'm trying as hard as I can to not say anything.
[430:45.57]What do you mean a complaint?
[430:46.31]What are you talking about?
[430:46.95]No, I said I'm trying really hard to not... It's got to be a complaint.
[430:51.76]I have just said this is very difficult to not do this.
[430:54.76]No, it's not.
[430:56.57]It's very difficult.
[430:58.67]And I've noticed an observation.
[431:01.07]Okay.
[431:07.75]I'm just simply observing a few things.
[431:12.17]This is not a complaint.
[431:13.99]It's just I really need to get better at timing that dodge.
[431:19.47]I'm going to own that one.
[431:20.73]Better at timing that dodge is what would have been good.
[431:23.89]There.
[431:24.21]That's nothing to do with anything to do with what happened.
[431:27.13]We're good.
[431:28.86]It's about timing the dodge.
[431:30.44]That's all that was.
[431:53.60]I still have six minutes.
[431:54.52]I feel like that's a million years, which is an observation.
[431:58.92]It's just, it feels like a long time.
[432:04.97]No, it's not.
[432:06.05]That's not a complaint.
[432:09.49]That's an observation.
[432:14.35]No, it's not.
[432:19.39]No, it has to be a complaint.
[432:23.91]Let me start over.
[432:24.65]Let me start over.
[432:25.43]Let me start over.
[432:27.07]I didn't complain.
[432:27.93]I just said, man, that's such a six more minutes.
[432:32.54]That's a long time.
[432:34.62]It is a long time.
[432:42.30]Yeah.
[433:28.16]Just kill me.
[433:32.85]He heals.
[433:33.39]He does heal.
[433:34.59]That is what happens.
[433:35.31]It's an observation.
[433:39.57]That's a heal.
[433:50.88]That's a big heal.
[433:53.47]And it's fine.
[433:54.69]I don't have a problem with it.
[433:55.47]A heal?
[433:56.25]At all.
[433:57.65]See?
[433:58.31]It's like it doesn't even... It doesn't even phase me.
[434:01.04]It doesn't even phase me.
[434:25.84]Doesn't even phase me right now.
[434:56.70]Hey, Virgil!
[434:57.48]That was just an observation.
[434:59.46]That was a pretty very long demon form.
[435:02.58]I'm just observing that.
[435:03.92]I don't care at all, by the way.
[435:05.62]I am fine with that.
[435:08.54]Just an observation.
[435:09.77]That was a pretty long demon mode.
[435:11.83]That was very interesting.
[435:13.25]I'm very interested by what I just saw.
[435:32.79]I'm just observing the game.
[435:35.60]It's fine, though.
[435:36.18]I don't care.
[435:59.53]yeah
[436:50.24]I gotta play very defensive.
[436:52.70]Everything is just fine.
[436:53.82]Just another observation.
[436:59.21]I like his jacket.
[437:00.89]I like his jacket.
[437:01.63]It's a nice jacket.
[437:21.38]I need to get a good combo in here.
[438:13.15]I'm not even close to beating him.
[438:24.82]That's not a complaint.
[438:25.70]That's a fact.
[438:26.56]Is time up?
[438:30.34]Is time up?
[438:30.90]Is time up?
[438:31.52]Is time up?
[438:38.87]Do we count the devil trigger complaint?
[438:42.17]Show it to me.
[438:43.23]Show it to me.
[438:43.63]I'll make the ultimate decision.
[438:45.89]Show it to me.
[438:50.17]Let me see.
[438:51.35]Give me a clip.
[439:03.36]I want to watch a clip.
[439:19.06]I think someone just said, chat, fuck you.
[439:21.56]It was an observation.
[439:22.84]See, that's good.
[439:26.46]That's good.
[439:26.83]That's good.
[439:27.17]That's good.
[439:31.07]Okay.
[439:37.53]You tried to save it?
[439:38.91]No, did I?
[439:39.71]Anybody got a clip?
[439:53.16]Nightbot keeps deleting them.
[439:56.88]Gaining viewers?
[439:58.96]Oh, nice.
[440:05.47]You were complaining and then said it was an observation.
[440:07.29]I don't think anybody even has this.
[440:16.95]Okay, is this it?
[440:23.19]Alright, let's see.
[440:23.79]Alright, I'll put this on stream and we'll go over it.
[440:37.60]And we're going to go over it.
[440:38.98]We're also going to vote on it.
[440:44.05]I'll give you my two cents on it, but then we'll vote.
[440:54.57]Oh wait, that would be really biased.
[440:56.12]Yeah, never mind.
[440:56.92]We're not voting.
[440:57.66]I'll tell you.
[441:01.50]Should we have a mod council decide?
[441:11.29]Alright, let's see.
[441:36.17]Hey, Virgil, that was just an observation.
[441:38.91]That was a pretty, very long demon form.
[441:42.01]I'm just observing that.
[441:43.59]Yeah, no, I did.
[441:44.67]No, for real.
[441:45.89]That is a literal complaint.
[441:47.83]That is actually a complaint.
[441:49.49]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[441:51.20]That is.
[441:51.46]And do you want to know how you can tell?
[441:55.00]I'm sorry, everybody, but this is how you can tell.
[441:57.22]This part right here.
[442:06.62]That part right there was me internally just talking shit about this game.
[442:14.27]And then I finally just let it out.
[442:21.78]Hey, Virgil, that was just an observation.
[442:24.54]That was a pretty, very long demon form.
[442:27.64]I'm just observing that.
[442:29.02]I don't care at all, by the way.
[442:31.20]I internally was screaming about how long that was.
[442:34.01]I was like, that's fucking bullshit how long that demon form was.
[442:39.75]I think that counts.
[442:45.63]But you said you don't care.
[442:46.86]I'm fine with that.
[442:50.16]Okay.
[442:56.79]No, I think it counts.
[443:02.43]You said, hey Virgil, like, hey Paul.
[443:12.97]Let's do it again.
[443:13.71]How about this?
[443:15.17]How about this?
[443:16.03]Can I be fucking quiet for five minutes?
[443:21.49]Wanna do it again?
[443:22.93]Can I be completely silent for five minutes while fighting?
[443:26.32]And I'm not muting.
[443:27.36]I'm gonna do this completely by the book.
[443:33.14]I'm just gonna watch the YouTube video of somebody beating this guy.
[443:50.75]I'm gonna play super passively.
[443:54.27]I don't care about combos.
[443:55.21]I just care about winning.
[443:58.60]That doesn't really help me, does it?
[444:32.87]Okay.
[444:32.97]Wait, there's another complaint one?
[444:35.29]Okay, I can complain now though, right?
[444:44.67]Oh, okay.
[444:50.45]He's got all of his health.
[444:58.74]Can somebody check real quick?
[445:00.87]What is the PlayStation 2 trophy completion rate of this encounter?
[445:08.04]I feel like it's less than 100 people.
[445:56.67]No, no, no, no, no.
[445:57.51]Okay, so when does it start?
[446:07.41]So we're... I thought it was going to come back.
[446:14.60]Alright, what are we doing this time?
[446:19.24]He is healing, too.
[446:34.44]Yeah, that includes, so no sound, no noise at all.
[446:37.04]No laughing, no heavy breathing, no Marge Simpson sounds, no Homer Simpson sounds.
[446:43.88]Five minutes of complete silence.
[446:45.10]And I'm not muting the microphone, I promise you.
[446:59.81]I didn't even get him down at all.
[447:01.13]Alright, so I'm going to start over here.
[447:12.95]Okay.
[447:15.81]Use DT until he does.
[447:24.80]Base camp.
[447:25.38]No, I'm not.
[447:26.90]Not after like seven and a half hours, eight hours streaming.
[447:32.96]This guy is...
[447:38.27]I never would have even gotten this far in PlayStation 2.
[447:42.03]I would have gotten to the second or third mission of this game and been like, no, I'm done.
[447:55.00]No facecam, no deal.
[447:56.24]I don't have any clothes on.
[447:57.45]23% on PS3 and PS4.
[448:09.24]75% of us got to this part and went... That was fun.
[448:18.51]Okay, are we ready?
[448:19.27]I have to be quiet.
[448:30.30]How am I going to mute the microphone?
[448:31.52]I have to touch it.
[448:32.90]Alright, you ready?
[448:33.36]Okay.
[448:35.08]Five minutes of complete and total silence.
[448:37.40]The microphone, I'm going to put it right here.
[448:39.06]You understand?
[448:42.82]Do you understand how close this is?
[448:44.00]You're going to hear anything that comes out of my fucking mouth.
[448:47.08]Anything.
[448:53.13]I can breathe though.
[448:53.85]Alright.
[448:54.69]Shit, you're going to hear me breathe.
[448:57.61]That counts.
[449:01.93]Okay, so tell me, does this count?
[449:08.70]That's just me actually breathing.
[449:13.49]I think we'll be able to tell the difference.
[449:20.14]Okay, here we go.
[449:24.12]Start the timer now.
[449:35.92]Hmm.
[449:36.36]Hmm.
[449:36.48]Hmm.
[450:16.36]Cut off.
[450:17.68]Too easy.
[450:20.24]Die.
[450:22.61]Yeah.
[451:14.22]Now I'm down
[451:44.77]Come on!
[451:47.48]Come on!
[452:51.77]I was trying so hard.
[452:54.41]I looked over at chat and somebody- you fucker.
[452:57.39]You asshole.
[452:59.23]Somebody said, bro, imagine stopping in the middle of a combo to shoot.
[453:03.75]I was like, fuck.
[453:05.57]No, dude.
[453:14.74]Imagine stopping in the middle of a combo to shoot.
[453:16.99]It's like that person thinks I'm such a fucking dummy.
[453:20.05]You know what I mean?
[453:21.47]Oh, that's so funny.
[453:22.31]Oh my God.
[453:24.93]I'm so sorry.
[453:32.07]You should have seen me pulsing.
[453:34.51]I was probably purple.
[453:36.29]I was trying so hard.
[453:37.15]It was like, and then it just came out.
[453:40.87]I was fucking shit.
[453:42.09]I had to have been shaking.
[453:45.64]Oh my god.
[453:55.17]This is so hard.
[453:56.23]I've been streaming for like 8 hours too.
[454:00.01]I might have to actually call it a night here.
[454:03.26]Alright, I'm gonna give it one more try.
[454:20.33]Oh my god, that's so funny.
[454:22.29]Another bet?
[454:31.70]One more?
[454:44.10]I was trying so hard to keep it in because I knew there was only like a minute left.
[454:53.61]Imagine stopping mid-combo to shoot.
[454:57.43]Oh, I'm doing a good job.
[454:58.47]I got him.
[454:59.59]Let me attack him.
[455:03.32]This is so ridiculous.
[455:04.62]Alright.
[455:08.64]I'm just going to play.
[455:09.28]Let's go.
[455:09.74]It's time right now.
[455:10.92]No more predictions.
[455:11.52]No more betting.
[455:13.06]I'm doing it right now.
[455:36.55]Dude, I... We're not even... I can complain again.
[455:40.42]I can complain.
[455:44.52]There's nothing in video games that I hate more than enemies that run away or teleport away, and you have to chase them.
[455:51.75]That's this whole entire video game.
[455:54.26]That's this entire video game.
[456:05.42]Okay, let's go.
[456:28.54]Trying to get the timing of the attack, attack, pause, attack, attack, attack.
[456:32.62]When you're in a game scenario, that shit is so fucking hard to actually do.
[457:04.97]How many controllers do you think have been broken from this game?
[457:08.43]Do you think it's more than 25,000?
[457:09.64]What do you think?
[457:11.94]Do you think it's more than 30,000 controllers have been broken from this game?
[457:59.49]I cannot beat this guy.
[458:01.77]Even Malenia, I was like making progress.
[458:04.41]This guy just destroys me every single time.
[458:34.62]Get the fuck out of there piece of shit
[459:04.57]Let's try this.
[459:09.03]Scum.
[459:44.36]Oh my god, dude, where is the opportunity to fucking attack this guy?
[460:17.23]what are the combos for this I don't even know them yes
[460:54.16]Pause.
[460:54.92]Why, why, why, why, why?
[460:56.08]I don't like pausing.
[460:58.76]I like fucking going.
[460:59.66]I like pressing X. I don't want to pause.
[461:37.39]Dude, does he just parry every single fucking move?
[461:40.98]He goes like... Why?
[461:43.86]How do I do that?
[461:44.60]Alright, I'm changing my stance.
[461:59.15]This is impossible with what I'm doing.
[462:04.57]This is impossible.
[462:09.33]I'm going to try to parry him.
[462:22.41]How does the parry work?
[462:42.56]Just press B when you're going to get hit.
[462:43.54]Let me test it.
[462:50.30]Did that work?
[462:56.21]Am I doing it?
[463:05.93]It's kind of a block.
[463:10.63]No, that's not going to help me at alright now.
[463:19.67]I couldn't even do anything.
[463:32.55]I have to stick with trickster.
[463:36.84]I'll I'm going to use the regular sword though.
[463:44.81]Did it not?
[463:47.89]Didn't I just change everything?
[463:48.86]Why is it back to these?
[463:49.58]Alright, let's try again.
[464:20.58]Didn't want this equipped This may be fun
[464:50.55]Dude, about that VLT.
[464:52.47]I don't think I'm ever going to beat this.
[464:54.25]I find this to be impossible.
[464:55.99]I don't think I'll ever do it.
[465:15.89]You beat Malenia?
[465:16.49]Malenia was easier than this.
[465:19.63]A hundred times easier.
[465:35.51]This has the heal from Malenia and teleporting.
[465:39.97]It's worse.
[465:44.51]Also, you can summon a summons.
[465:46.34]This may not work.
[466:07.26]This is fucking ridiculous.
[466:09.72]This is ridiculous.
[466:14.10]Stop backing off.
[466:15.42]Dude, look what he does.
[466:16.84]Wow.
[466:16.92]I didn't back off.
[466:18.78]He did.
[466:19.70]You should be yelling at his fucking chat.
[466:22.02]He's doing it.
[466:22.70]Not me.
[466:23.88]I'm not.
[466:24.24]Look.
[466:27.32]He's backing away.
[466:33.59]the power of sparta
[467:08.96]Oh my god.
[467:09.84]He just parries every single fucking move.
[467:15.54]There is no exchange.
[467:16.70]He just blocks and then teleports away and then does this.
[467:35.17]Look at how much slower my moves are.
[467:36.67]I'm waving around a fucking toy.
[467:38.71]I'm like, one, two, three, four.
[467:41.86]And he's already moved across the map by the time I do it.
[468:29.43]Get out of your fucking demon form, dude.
[468:31.93]I can't even hurt him.
[468:32.75]Yeah, Malenia didn't have a fucking form where she goes, no, rot.
[468:41.19]You can't hurt me at all.
[468:42.39]I'm invincible and I can heal off you.
[468:44.73]I'm invincible for a full two minutes.
[469:09.44]Oh, wait.
[469:10.68]Oh, wait.
[469:12.32]Oh, wait.
[469:13.68]Oh, oh, wait.
[469:29.25]We both have the same idea.
[469:50.79]Dodge's attacks, bro.
[469:52.19]Come on, dude.
[469:53.27]Do you have any idea how un-fucking-bearable this encounter is?
[469:58.09]Have you played it?
[469:59.85]Have you played it?
[470:01.23]Did you play it?
[470:02.37]If you didn't, then silence.
[470:05.69]If you did, you know.
[470:08.58]What did I just do?
[470:09.12]Oh.
[470:25.32]I can't even get him down to 50% before I'm just dead.
[470:29.80]I'm going to do this three more times and then I'm turning the stream off.
[470:33.22]I'm getting out of here.
[470:33.94]I'm going to free myself from this fucking madness.
[470:45.30]Die.
[470:47.36]Die.
[471:13.46]This is the first game I played when I was six years old.
[471:15.84]I am so sorry for six-year-old you.
[471:19.07]You probably had so many awful memories of this game.
[471:44.72]Look at my health!
[472:11.13]Nobody played this when they were six.
[472:12.49]They're full of shit.
[472:13.37]Don't listen to them.
[472:56.96]What the fuck was that?!
[473:01.90]Where's my move that can do that, Dante?! !
[473:05.15]Get back to the fuckin' gym!
[473:07.27]Lift a little bit more weights!
[473:12.97]He's almost back to full health again.
[473:15.51]He's heal- wait.
[473:17.79]He doesn't even- this is not Malenia.
[473:20.37]He just heals when he's in demon form.
[473:23.70]What is this fucking dog shit?
[473:32.02]He doesn't have to hit me.
[473:34.92]So do you.
[473:35.50]Yeah, I'm the video game protagonist.
[473:38.26]Nobody else gets those powers.
[473:49.48]I wish you just didn't counter every other swing.
[473:51.70]Like, it just would be so much more... You have to counter every move?
[473:57.21]Like, dude, why can't I just attack him?
[474:17.71]have to damage burst him out of that dude good luck when he blocks 90 of every swing you do no matter what alright two more attempts and I'm uninstalling the game
[475:11.18]No!
[475:11.78]Stay out of that!
[475:21.23]Oh my god, dude.
[475:38.62]Give me a fucking break.
[476:00.70]I don't have any heals.
[476:25.09]Didn't I buy one?
[476:30.94]I thought I had a large heal put it on easy wait they're gone gone if you use it they're gone they don't come back like when I restart that checkpoint it's fucking five grand to buy one of those
[477:00.59]Oh, that's awful.
[477:05.46]It's 10,000 now to buy a heal.
[477:07.80]You have to restart the whole mission.
[477:10.84]Are you kidding me?
[477:13.37]Oh, that stinks.
[477:15.65]Okay, well...
[477:34.48]restart the mission won't that put me to the first boss fight though wait customize okay yeah yeah yeah I see uh so what the hell am I gonna do here
[477:58.40]All the gold orbs were used already.
[478:00.10]I didn't even know there was a final, final, final fight.
[478:02.72]I thought we were like working together.
[478:04.78]Oh yeah, we won together.
[478:05.76]Just go farm orbs.
[478:11.34]I might do that.
[478:12.50]Not tonight though.
[478:13.15]Okay.
[478:42.00]I wish I could not be stuck in that animation.
[478:44.16]Does so much damage.
[478:53.39]It's already over.
[479:09.76]That's a good place to get orbs.
[479:30.84]That's a good spot to do it.
[479:35.02]19 cancel out of the dive kick if you mission two I just want to buy like another one of those gold orbs I had two
[480:22.93]I just don't think it's possible without that.
[480:25.07]Without like 3 golden orbs and like 8 heals.
[480:28.56]I'm going in there, I'm bringing a backpack full of shit into that fight when I go in there again.
[480:32.16]I'm gonna have 10 heals and 30 revives.
[480:37.51]I don't care if I die 15 times in a row.
[481:05.27]Never mind, I gave up.
[481:06.85]Never mind.
[481:10.21]I just saw how many I collected.
[481:11.47]That's going to take like six hours.
[481:16.62]Alright, that's it.
[481:17.44]I'm out of here.
[481:19.82]And I'm never playing this game ever again.
[481:22.13]I mean, until I'm dead.
[481:23.31]Like, it's not going to happen ever again.
[481:27.64]Yeah, they'll be doing a funeral for me.
[481:30.22]They'll be like, wait, but he never finished.
[481:32.61]He didn't beat Virgil.
[481:33.77]The priest isn't going to go.
[481:36.03]Good.
[481:37.35]Fuck that whole game.
[481:40.01]Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to see our friend be put to rest under the
[482:09.93]I'm getting weird with this one.
[482:36.54]Block every move, Andy.
[483:02.98]That's it.
[483:04.40]That's it.
[483:32.09]God damn it.
[484:00.62]You're just healing, you PIECE OF SHIT!! !
[484:33.71]Even in demon form, he blocks every move.
[484:37.43]How the fuck do you do this?
[484:39.91]Like, honestly.
[484:40.77]This is fucking impossible.
[484:55.06]It took me two years.
[484:58.20]You should be jumping.
[484:58.98]Dude.
[485:02.86]Is this fucking dickhead on a top 10 list of most annoying boss fights in history?
[485:08.11]He has to be.
[485:08.63]Yeah, get fucking exploited.
[485:19.72]Yeah.
[485:37.45]fucking doing.
[486:16.21]Dude, when you're locked on, why can you swing in a different direction?
[486:48.17]Dude, it's just- it's so fucking annoying.
[486:52.40]It just like hurts just to attack him.
[487:17.83]I don't know what the fuck's going on with this game.
[487:20.40]But like, what the hell is going on here?
[487:23.78]The game just literally turned off and is down on my taskbar.
[487:28.22]Four hours ago, an explosion happened in my room.
[487:33.85]What is going on with this game?
[487:44.16]I'm going to lower the volume because I have no idea what's going to happen here.
[487:56.11]Am I back?
[487:58.55]Oh my god.
[488:51.86]What's the point of a lock-on if you swing in a different direction?
[489:40.79]Shit, I can't... No more teleporting!
[490:01.87]It's like the worst mechanic in every single video game!
[490:26.07]Oh
[490:56.50]What the hell is this move?
[490:58.30]Oh my god, what does that mean?
[490:59.48]Holy fucking shit, dude.
[491:31.84]Dude, this weapon switching thing makes me want to fucking puke as well.
[491:38.24]What's he doing?
[491:41.45]Where are my fucking heals?
[491:43.25]Oh my god.
[491:44.39]This 2000 fucking 2 video game.
[491:48.01]I didn't restart the mission.
[491:51.39]Oh my god damn it, dude.
[492:18.73]I like just why like you've got to be fucking kidding me.
[492:22.51]That is infuriating.
[492:49.58]I literally had it.
[492:51.70]Yeah, by doing the jump attack move.
[492:54.02]I'm so fucking pissed right now.
[492:58.74]I am so angry.
[493:04.13]Can I save it here so I don't have to do this shit over and over again if I want to restart the game?
[493:17.21]Oh, do I have to restart every single time?
[493:21.03]What if I do this?
[493:21.56]Is that going to do it?
[493:24.37]Is that going to work?
[494:11.85]No more teleport!
[494:13.19]God damn it!
[494:46.28]Nice.
[495:30.25]Oh great.
[495:40.49]I can't move!
[496:08.24]Where is he?
[496:11.32]Dude.
[496:50.29]Come on.
[497:49.34]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[497:50.88]Oh, OK.
[497:51.54]It's over.
[497:51.82]I win.
[497:52.08]Game sucks.
[497:56.32]What's wrong?
[497:57.40]Is that all you got?
[497:59.76]Come on.
[498:00.84]Get up.
[498:01.88]You can do better than that.
[498:08.98]The portal to the human world is closing, Dante.
[498:16.11]Because the amulets have been separated.
[498:18.39]Let's finish this first.
[498:20.81]I have to stop you.
[498:22.89]Even if that means killing you.
[498:26.96]The sweat coming down my face right now.
[498:29.14]It's like all over my face.
[498:31.62]I look fucked up.
[498:35.88]If I turned on the webcam right now, I would scare you.
[498:50.57]Malenia is definitely harder.
[498:51.46]Yeah, that wasn't even that bad.
[499:10.70]No one can have this, Dante.
[499:11.98]It's mine.
[499:16.49]It belongs to a son of Sparta.
[499:24.71]Leave me, though, if you don't want to be trapped in a demon world.
[499:31.71]I'm staying in this place.
[499:34.80]Okay, I took a picture.
[499:35.56]I'll put it in the Discord tomorrow.
[500:01.57]Yeah, no food quiz.
[500:02.51]I'm sorry.
[500:02.99]I had to beat Devil May Cry 3 and I almost puked.
[500:30.12]Why is the volume so low now?
[500:31.20]I didn't turn it down.
[500:31.78]Did I?
[500:32.14]Hahaha.
[501:09.49]Are you crying?
[501:12.71]It's only the rain.
[501:16.57]The rain already stopped.
[501:22.82]Devils never cry.
[501:24.76]Oh wait.
[501:27.32]But they may though, right?
[501:31.37]Devil May Cry when he loses a loved one don't you think oh there it is maybe by the way looks like we're gonna be busy for a while
[502:01.07]We going again?
[502:03.49]Oh, we are going again.
[502:45.07]Doing my victory lap.
[502:52.25]Oh, it's counting them.
[502:53.57]Oops.
[503:03.34]That was fun.
[503:05.28]That was a lot more intense than I thought it was going to be.
[503:11.25]I knew Devil May Cry was a hard game, but I didn't know it was a really hard game.
[503:17.01]I would consider this to be really hard.
[503:28.32]DMC3 is hard, DMC4 and DMC5 are less so.
[503:30.50]3 is probably the hardest one.
[503:41.04]I remember 5 coming out and being interested in 5.
[503:59.37]You could probably beat DMC2 with one hand.
[504:01.75]Really?
[504:02.17]Jeez.
[504:06.65]You would really like 5.
[504:10.60]Well, put it on the list.
[504:19.80]I would play at least the newer ones.
[504:21.36]I know the older ones can be a little weird, right?
[504:25.28]The first one's like a completely different video game from what you guys said last night, right?
[504:46.04]The MC1 is very Resident Evil.
[504:55.51]Three onward is fine.
[505:09.93]You think one still holds up?
[505:11.89]It probably does.
[505:13.87]But I would want to do the ones with the similar gameplay structure.
[505:20.80]Before I go back into the other ones.
[505:25.08]It absolutely does not.
[505:26.76]Oh, no.
[505:43.10]Can I get to 100?
[505:45.16]Well, if I wasn't RP walking around, maybe I could have.
[506:01.11]Come on, don't I get to 97?
[506:02.63]Ah, shit.
[506:04.83]It's okay.
[506:09.60]What happened next?
[506:11.26]Nothing, really.
[506:12.80]Did you see how I beat that?
[506:14.16]In two or three tries.
[506:15.40]After I said, I'm going to uninstall the game.
[506:19.03]I said the same thing about Elden Ring.
[506:20.85]Millennium.
[506:41.77]That's how I know I have to beat it.
[506:43.39]That's the best way to do it.
[506:46.87]Devil May Cry.
[507:17.20]Nice.
[507:24.86]Okay.
[507:26.72]Alright.
[507:28.96]I'll take an A for the first time.
[507:31.88]The entire playthrough at the last boss.
[507:38.70]Sounds good to me.
[507:46.43]Yeah, that was about my report card.
[507:51.85]I'd say that's pretty close.
[508:01.60]I do hate being considered normal, so play it on hard.
[508:08.48]Okay, cool.
[508:16.19]Alright.
[508:17.91]I'll see you guys later.
[508:18.73]Let's save it again.
[508:23.75]Just in case I want to open this up.
[508:26.01]For any reason.
[508:30.60]And I'll see you guys later.
[508:32.88]I'm glad I beat it.
[508:34.24]I'm glad I saw it to the end.
[508:37.32]Just had to threaten to uninstall it a few times.
[508:40.64]Just to get myself seriously in that mode.
[508:45.95]I gotta pull that card out sometimes.
[508:49.73]Yeah, I'm glad I played it.
[508:50.97]I will probably play the other ones too.
[508:53.19]At least, maybe five.
[508:54.57]I would say five would be next up.
[508:56.76]Maybe four.
[508:58.84]The next time you will see me live will be on the... Let's see.
[509:07.38]Maybe Saturday.
[509:08.48]Saturday.
[509:08.70]Maybe Sunday.
[509:10.38]Sunday the 21st.
[509:15.38]We'll see.
[509:15.86]I might reverse delay to Saturday.
[509:17.43]That's possible.
[509:19.85]Plan on Sunday, but there might be a reverse delay to start on Saturday.
[509:29.57]Plan on Sunday, though.
[509:35.82]Thanks for watching.
[509:37.90]Thanks for putting up with my complaints.
[509:40.72]I don't think... This was not really a complaint stream.
[509:42.92]Not till like the last two hours.
[509:46.32]No, I mean, this was a kind of a complaint stream.
[509:50.72]The last couple hours were.
[509:51.62]I agree.
[509:53.38]They were observations.
[509:54.55]Yeah, that's fine.
[509:59.45]Also, I have no idea what happened.
[510:01.60]And I'd be lying if I was saying that didn't throw me off.
[510:06.40]That like explosion shit from earlier.
[510:08.22]That like really fucking threw me off big time.
[510:11.62]I don't know why that happened.
[510:13.41]If it was a bug in the game, that's a really awful bug.
[510:17.41]I'm not going to say that's what it was because I don't know.
[510:20.27]I have no idea why that happened.
[510:22.69]But who has any idea at this point?
[510:26.49]I'm just sorry that that happened, because I wish it didn't.
[510:28.71]Because that shit sucks.
[510:30.35]Especially when you're not prepared for it.
[510:34.03]So.
[510:37.34]I don't think, I mean, look what happened.
[510:39.20]I mean, we played.
[510:39.82]I didn't change any settings.
[510:42.32]I didn't make any changes.
[510:44.52]After 15 hours in the game, that's the only time that happened.
[510:47.17]I don't.
[510:48.77]I mean, my OBS is fine.
[510:50.11]My audio system's fine.
[510:54.89]I have no idea.
[510:57.63]I wonder if that really was an ultra rare bug that hung up the computer for a second and then the audio just went crazy.
[511:06.22]For those of you that thought that was really funny, I'm glad you did.
[511:15.14]But for those of you that didn't think that was funny, yeah, I'm sorry.
[511:19.59]I wish it was easier to control that kind of stuff from happening, but
[511:26.35]Be careful.
[511:27.07]Take care of yourselves.
[511:27.67]I'll see you Sunday or Saturday.
[511:30.81]Take care of yourselves.
[511:32.39]Have a great night.
[511:36.67]And thanks for watching, as always.
[511:39.23]See you guys Saturday or Sunday.
[511:40.39]Take care.
[511:40.97]Call your mother.
[511:42.27]Get some sleep.
[511:44.09]See you soon.
[512:01.96]you
[512:36.84]Thank you.
