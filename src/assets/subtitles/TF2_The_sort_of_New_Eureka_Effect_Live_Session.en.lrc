[00:05.23]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:07.71]Jerma here with a live gameplay commentary.
[00:11.63]Playing as the engineer with the new Eureka Effect soldier.
[00:15.53]And you're probably saying to yourself, damn it, to explain what you're talking about here, engineer.
[00:20.17]Well, I will.
[00:21.49]The old Eureka Effect was not really that good and it still ain't really that good right now.
[00:28.32]The 50% slower repair rate and upgrade rate takes 17 goddamn times before you get your Sentra to 0 to 200 or any of your other buildings of course.
[00:39.13]But that's okay, because now you can teleport to spawn, or you can teleport to an exit, whenever you happen to feel like it.
[00:47.04]So we're gonna let Jerma take over here.
[00:48.84]He's gonna do a live commentary about the Eureka Effect, and I'm gonna go fill my diaper with shit.
[00:57.08]Oh, a sandwich.
[00:58.24]That was delicious.
[00:59.28]That was delicious.
[01:00.30]That was delicious.
[01:01.76]Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[01:03.46]Not gonna waste any time here.
[01:04.82]I'm gonna try to actually get...
[01:08.54]the tele- I wanna show you the teleporter thing.
[01:11.58]I'm gonna try to- whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:15.76]Oh god, I hate when this happens!
[01:18.69]You get like the uber for two seconds and you think, oh my, it must be a panic uber and you run out and then it ends on you and you turn around running backwards and you just get absolutely annihilated.
[01:29.40]We really can't get out of here.
[01:30.50]I'm going to go for Indiana Jones.
[01:35.08]Indiana Jones Engineer.
[01:36.16]You guys ready?
[01:36.98]This is what we call Indiana Jones.
[01:40.55]See, I helped.
[01:41.73]I helped with that.
[01:44.53]Come on, give me the kill.
[01:45.71]I'm just going to put this here.
[01:47.81]Just because.
[01:48.45]To give a distraction so I can come up here and kill this guy.
[01:51.03]No, the soldier already... Okay, good job.
[01:54.17]That was exactly what I was going to do.
[01:59.50]Oh, was he standing right there?
[02:02.80]Did I just completely miss that guy?
[02:05.04]Well, whatever.
[02:05.88]Now I have some time.
[02:07.66]I've got some time to build up my entrances and stuff.
[02:10.62]Hopefully we don't just steamroll right now.
[02:14.20]Because that would not be good.
[02:16.41]Because I do want to try this Eureka Effect thing.
[02:19.31]I want to go teleport to the exit.
[02:21.99]I want to find myself in a teleportation device.
[02:26.17]Yep.
[02:26.51]Okay.
[02:28.73]We're just going to forget.
[02:29.31]You know what?
[02:29.81]Let's try... No, that's a bad idea.
[02:31.43]I was... Oh my god, I'm going to stop burping.
[02:35.46]Let's build this just so I can carry it.
[02:37.32]This is the worst part, though.
[02:39.34]This takes so long.
[02:43.26]Let's get that exit built right here.
[02:46.76]So now... Shoot him!
[02:49.60]What the hell was that?
[02:50.44]Did you guys see that?
[02:53.43]No, no, no, no, no.
[02:54.31]This ain't going to happen.
[02:56.88]I knew you needed, like, a 2% shot left.
[03:01.74]But once this exit is built, I can do wacky stuff like this.
[03:06.24]Let's see if I can do it.
[03:07.20]Here we go.
[03:08.20]And let's go back to base.
[03:09.12]Let's fill up on our ammo.
[03:11.26]And then let's immediately go back to the teleporter exit.
[03:16.88]Okay, here we are.
[03:18.34]So that's kinda cool.
[03:20.07]That's cool.
[03:22.27]Is it good enough?
[03:24.15]I don't know, because look, it really does take such an absurdly long time to build up your sentries and to repair and everything.
[03:32.69]So I don't know, I guess if you like to fly around and teleport around and stuff, it's kinda cool.
[03:37.37]But at the same time... At what cost?!
[03:41.42]At what cost?!
[03:43.70]This is a really bad idea, because I don't have the Wrangler, but you know, he probably does.
[03:46.76]I wonder if he does.
[03:47.34]Well, this is a terrible idea.
[03:50.52]Yeah, this is the worst idea I've ever had.
[03:53.12]Yeah, hey!
[03:54.10]Hey!
[03:56.60]Get him!
[03:57.74]Spray him!
[03:58.98]What?
[03:59.80]Oh, well that sucks.
[04:02.57]That really sucks.
[04:03.59]What is this guy doing?
[04:04.33]This guy's like inside of the door.
[04:08.49]Oh, I need some ammo to be able to refill.
[04:12.89]Let's get a dispenser up... right here.
[04:18.68]Are we moving?
[04:19.50]Kind of.
[04:20.04]We're kind of moving.
[04:23.36]Yeah, sort of.
[04:26.20]Let's build this up here.
[04:27.25]That's probably a better idea.
[04:29.75]Better idea.
[04:31.61]Maybe.
[04:32.33]I don't have the Wrangler on, which is not going to help me that much.
[04:37.47]Yeah, this is bad.
[04:39.85]It's alright, though.
[04:41.05]Let it be a distraction.
[04:42.41]It'll get probably one or two kills.
[04:43.77]It'll get this guy, too.
[04:45.61]No, maybe not.
[04:46.19]Well, yeah, actually, if this guy peeks out, yeah, he's dead.
[04:48.39]This guy's dead, because here comes a demo.
[04:51.27]Fighting him.
[04:51.73]You know what?
[04:52.57]Screw it.
[04:52.85]I'll go down there and get him.
[04:54.81]Wait a minute.
[04:55.67]Wait a minute.
[04:56.09]Wait a minute.
[04:56.43]Wait a minute.
[04:56.99]Wait just one minute.
[04:58.39]Yes.
[04:59.97]I was gonna say.
[05:02.25]That guy's not real.
[05:04.44]Oh, I need... I need my stuff.
[05:08.54]I gotta go back up there and grab the sentry.
[05:11.45]Dispenser's gonna have to die, unfortunately, because I don't really care to repair it or bring it because we're moving too fast.
[05:20.45]Come here.
[05:21.17]And we're about to get this next spawn.
[05:25.59]So, life of an offensive engineer, you're just constantly moving.
[05:31.41]But it's fun, though.
[05:33.01]It's a fun time.
[05:35.34]Where's that guy go?
[05:35.98]That's a spy.
[05:37.12]Oh, shit.
[05:38.12]No, don't go up there.
[05:39.02]Please tell me you're gonna kill that pyro, because I really don't want to deal with him.
[05:44.18]Come on, build, build, build, build.
[05:45.70]Yeah, you're still alive.
[05:47.66]Still alive.
[05:48.09]I'm gonna have to do a spy call out.
[05:50.57]Spy creeping around here.
[05:53.65]Where is he?
[05:54.17]Which one?
[05:56.19]He's probably gonna appear right next to me.
[05:57.41]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:58.93]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[06:01.21]Well, I'll just have to kill you.
[06:03.59]Well, no, I won't kill you.
[06:04.43]Somebody else will.
[06:06.75]Get out of here!
[06:09.05]Damn, dude.
[06:10.77]You're making my life hard.
[06:11.85]Somebody needs to get rid of that little Mini-Sentry.
[06:16.87]So I can build this.
[06:18.68]Oh, damn.
[06:20.76]Kill him before he gets the sentry!
[06:26.28]Holy shit, what the fuck is going on up there?
[06:31.20]I'm dead.
[06:31.80]I'm gonna burn.
[06:32.46]Bye.
[06:33.22]But please...
[06:34.63]There's like five people.
[06:36.03]There's an entire crew in that room.
[06:42.98]Oh my god.
[06:44.14]This sentry is doing so much work right now.
[06:47.52]Why do I not have an exit built?
[06:49.52]I could just teleport right to it right now.
[06:53.94]This thing.
[06:55.53]They have a teleporter in here?
[06:58.19]Is that what it is?
[06:58.71]It has to be, right?
[07:01.03]Yeah, they do.
[07:01.47]Alright, well, let's just get rid of this stuff.
[07:06.28]I'm so sorry that you're dead.
[07:08.20]I'm so sorry that you died right there.
[07:09.84]Nothing I could have done.
[07:12.18]Nothing that could be done.
[07:15.38]We actually might win this right now.
[07:18.15]I have, like, not shown the Eureka effects, like, cool abilities, like, really, yet.
[07:23.81]I've shown it, like, one time.
[07:25.49]We're just playing, like, Engineer.
[07:26.91]Alright, now we're gonna show up, because I'm gonna have an opportunity here to build an exit right here.
[07:32.73]Exit's gonna... By the time this is built... So here's the strategy.
[07:36.02]Here's the strat right here.
[07:36.72]We're gonna try to get this thing built.
[07:38.62]I'm gonna teleport back to spawn.
[07:40.24]So here we go, teleporting back to spawn.
[07:43.34]Let's go, fill up, and then immediately come back.
[07:47.37]Very good.
[07:49.35]And there you go.
[07:50.73]We are back.
[07:51.39]I can build... Actually, I should destroy that.
[07:54.01]So I can build one down here.
[07:55.05]And you know what?
[07:57.71]We're gonna do it again.
[07:58.55]We're gonna do it again.
[07:59.23]We're gonna go right back to spawn and come right back immediately.
[08:02.26]Fill up, come right back.
[08:04.66]Hello?
[08:06.88]Yes, that is very cool.
[08:09.16]Who is it?
[08:09.94]What?
[08:10.50]Oh, it's this guy.
[08:13.28]Well, don't... What is this guy doing?
[08:15.50]What the hell is that guy doing?
[08:17.58]Let's get this to level three.
[08:21.95]And then we're going to build an entrance so people can actually use this thing.
[08:26.45]That would be ideal, right?
[08:37.10]Should I move this?
[08:38.27]I feel like this is not really doing... Yeah, it's not really doing that much right now.
[08:41.45]We're moving too fast!
[08:43.77]Hey!
[08:44.59]Spy.
[08:46.37]Block him.
[08:47.43]Block him.
[08:47.79]He's right here somewhere.
[08:49.37]Where?
[08:51.43]I don't know.
[08:53.02]He's down here!
[08:56.06]Get this... Come on, come on, come on!
[08:57.32]Hurry up!
[08:58.64]Get to level 3 already!
[09:01.55]Oh, damn it.
[09:02.59]Oh, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it.
[09:04.97]It's okay.
[09:06.65]Here's the deer.
[09:07.51]Here's the deer.
[09:08.53]We are going to go back to spawn.
[09:09.77]I'm going to build the entrance right out here.
[09:14.52]So, entrance, go up.
[09:17.76]Bring you right to the action.
[09:20.64]And, you know, while that's building, let's just go ahead and teleport to the exit.
[09:25.07]Hello!
[09:26.91]Alright.
[09:27.69]Sentry.
[09:28.27]Going up.
[09:29.71]But this one I want like... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[09:34.50]I don't think so.
[09:35.94]I just don't think so.
[09:36.76]Not today.
[09:38.50]Not today.
[09:41.30]And what do we say to the god of death?
[09:43.74]Not today.
[09:46.65]That's built.
[09:47.15]No, it's not level 3.
[09:48.71]This is going to take ages.
[09:52.47]Ugh.
[09:52.71]What a snooze.
[09:55.03]What a total snooze.
[09:57.82]I would have been already done by now.
[10:01.34]Well, it's level 2 now.
[10:02.46]At least it's level 2.
[10:03.12]We'll just get it to level 3.
[10:06.09]Why not?
[10:06.43]I mean, what else am I doing right now?
[10:09.43]Besides just sitting here being a fucking dingus.
[10:11.69]I don't want to get backstabbed.
[10:14.93]That would not be cool.
[10:18.48]Level 3!
[10:19.26]Oh my god, somebody's calling me.
[10:22.70]On the... Oh, get... Move.
[10:25.98]Leave me alone.
[10:29.01]I don't want to be called right now.
[10:30.19]There we go.
[10:34.85]Let's move.
[10:35.25]Let's get some action in here.
[10:37.01]That was a good, like, three full minutes of me hitting things with a wrench.
[10:40.62]So we got that covered.
[10:45.88]And there's a pyro dead.
[10:46.86]There's another pyro that's going to die.
[10:48.84]That's two dead pyros.
[10:50.82]Let's get on it.
[10:52.57]Move, move, move, move, move, move, move.
[10:53.85]Now I'll get off of it because there's somebody trying to come destroy my stuff.
[10:59.08]He's dead.
[11:00.30]There's another guy over here who's just on fire.
[11:03.23]Alright.
[11:05.91]We are going... No, we're not going to destroy that yet.
[11:09.71]Oh, I wish this thing was the Rescue Ranger.
[11:12.71]Where am I going?
[11:14.63]I'm not sure of what I'm doing here, guys, but I did it.
[11:19.68]Well, let's get on.
[11:20.38]Let's push it.
[11:20.90]We don't got to go far.
[11:23.92]Exit.
[11:24.30]Exit strategy.
[11:24.88]Is this thing still shooting?
[11:27.87]It is.
[11:29.66]I may leave this back here just for the denial, the area denial.
[11:32.68]If anyone wants to come back here and screw with us.
[11:35.60]But then again, it might not be a terrible idea to bring it to the front lines.
[11:42.71]And let's let these... a Dead Ringer.
[11:47.59]Can I come back in time?
[11:48.85]Yes, I can.
[11:51.37]But we are right here anyways.
[11:52.89]Yeah, this... I can destroy my exit.
[11:56.39]There's no reason to have it right now.
[11:59.26]Can't really build, unless I can do this.
[12:00.81]I'm gonna try for something really, really... I wonder if I can do it.
[12:05.67]If I can do it, it'll be really cool.
[12:07.31]Let's get rid of the entrance.
[12:10.67]And let's try to build an exit, just an exit down here.
[12:14.57]Where nobody cares to look.
[12:17.61]Oh, but no, I'm being chased.
[12:19.73]Shit.
[12:20.89]I didn't realize like three people were still chasing me.
[12:24.46]Alright, we gotta end this.
[12:28.19]I gotta go power class.
[12:29.17]We needed power.
[12:30.67]Engineer was just not doing it at the moment.
[12:33.70]And what is happening?
[12:34.78]And how is this guy still killing everybody?
[12:37.34]Let me get that medic.
[12:40.24]Let me get that medic.
[12:41.08]Let's do it.
[12:42.42]Me and you, baby.
[12:43.75]Me and you.
[12:44.03]We're gonna take on the whole world.
[12:45.17]I'll just turn the corner and just get exploded by a rocket.
[12:54.58]This is the one.
[12:55.26]This is the one.
[12:55.58]We only have 2 minutes and 28 seconds.
[12:57.60]This has to happen now.
[13:00.28]I got a Telefrag.
[13:02.00]Alright.
[13:04.17]I'll take a Telefrag.
[13:05.11]Here we go.
[13:07.51]Here we go.
[13:07.77]This is the push.
[13:08.65]Here we go.
[13:09.41]This is the one.
[13:10.67]This is the push.
[13:13.29]Come on now!
[13:15.15]Geez, man.
[13:15.77]They got so much stuff and so many people.
[13:19.87]This is not the push.
[13:22.98]I don't think this is the push at all.
[13:25.21]That didn't hit him.
[13:26.81]You've got to be kidding me.
[13:29.21]That hit somebody.
[13:29.89]Any more medics?
[13:33.07]Where'd you go, man?
[13:33.57]Where'd you go?
[13:34.15]Where'd you go?
[13:36.69]I need some heals.
[13:37.25]I need some heals.
[13:41.25]Man, oh man.
[13:43.99]Come on now.
[13:46.95]Here we go.
[13:47.39]Come on.
[13:47.99]Everybody get on it.
[13:49.69]We got some advantage here.
[13:50.79]We got an advantage.
[13:52.94]Got the slight advantage.
[13:57.56]Come on, drop down.
[13:59.10]Oh, that got fucking backstabbed!
[14:00.74]No!
[14:01.40]God damn it, I was gonna detonate that and... We got it, we got it, we got it, come on.
[14:05.44]Everybody get on there.
[14:07.06]All human beings get on there.
[14:11.49]Come on, I gotta get out there, I gotta get out there!
[14:15.25]It's so close, we have one minute.
[14:17.89]One minute.
[14:20.03]One minute.
[14:21.21]They're all going over there.
[14:23.70]That didn't hit anybody?
[14:25.30]Come on.
[14:25.92]I don't think we're gonna do it.
[14:27.74]No, don't be bad attitude.
[14:28.70]That was a bad attitude.
[14:29.44]Let's go.
[14:29.80]Get a... I died.
[14:31.86]Shit.
[14:35.62]Unless we get up there right now.
[14:36.89]46 seconds.
[14:41.51]Come on, now.
[14:44.25]Let's just do this thing.
[14:47.31]Spoke too soon.
[14:47.99]That's a spy.
[14:49.53]Shit, if I just could aim my weapon...
[14:52.61]That guy would have died a long time ago.
[14:57.15]Go this way.
[14:57.67]I'm going this way.
[14:58.23]No, I'm not.
[14:59.49]Too many scouts.
[15:01.89]Don't care.
[15:02.15]I'm wrapping around.
[15:04.04]Wrap all the way around.
[15:06.28]I got full ammo.
[15:07.16]Full loaded.
[15:07.70]There we go.
[15:11.64]Scout does no.
[15:12.46]Neither does the spy.
[15:13.87]Now he does.
[15:14.41]Alright.
[15:16.93]We just gotta get this heavy.
[15:17.81]Gotta get this heavy up here.
[15:20.39]Get on it.
[15:21.71]Just get on it and stop bottling.
[15:23.99]Come on.
[15:25.19]Get on it.
[15:26.67]Come on, everybody.
[15:27.95]I'm getting off.
[15:28.49]I'm getting off.
[15:29.13]You gotta get off right now because you gotta help out the team.
[15:31.06]You gotta get the people that are going in.
