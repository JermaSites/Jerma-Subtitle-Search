[00:02.15]He's too early?
[00:04.49]Well, I've... Come on, guys.
[00:06.71]I mean, I gotta give you... I gotta show you, like, a reveal, right?
[00:10.99]I mean, come on.
[00:12.83]Let's take... I mean, I'm not gonna waste any time.
[00:15.18]Here we are.
[00:16.74]We're here.
[00:17.54]We made it.
[00:19.16]I'm still in the old house.
[00:22.94]Look it.
[00:23.24]I'm cleaning up, though.
[00:24.50]Take a look at that.
[00:25.62]This looks pretty much identical to the last time you saw it.
[00:30.52]Hold on, though.
[00:31.08]Wait a minute.
[00:33.89]This chair wasn't unfolded.
[00:36.39]It was folded up like this, in the corner.
[00:42.27]Making progress.
[00:46.15]Nice pants.
[00:48.07]It's been a rough week, okay?
[00:50.77]It's been rough.
[00:52.83]No, hi, how you doing?
[00:54.45]I gotta get off this facecam right now.
[00:56.40]Get out of here.
[01:01.00]Here comes a rant.
[01:03.11]No, not today.
[01:05.13]No rant today.
[01:06.23]We're just hanging out today.
[01:09.32]I got a lot going on this week.
[01:11.76]I'll be in Vegas, for those of you that don't know.
[01:15.10]This is not the move this week going into next week is, hey, signing papers and getting things ready and getting an actual move in date and then coming back to Massachusetts and
[01:31.07]getting out of here completely, selling, and then going back to Vegas.
[01:37.72]So as you can imagine, it's been a, it's a lot, right?
[01:42.34]So I'm not going to stream the closing.
[01:48.07]So today wasn't live yesterday or the day before or the day before.
[01:53.80]It's at that moment where it's becoming real and I really can't dedicate any of my time to anything else besides selling my house and moving to Vegas.
[02:05.77]So, I remember we talked about a few weeks ago, a month ago, that eventually, unfortunately, this is the day where I have to say this.
[02:16.69]As of Friday, right, because obviously this week I'm going to Vegas, I ain't going to be around for about a week.
[02:25.78]I'm coming back, though.
[02:26.60]I'll be back.
[02:27.50]I'll be back.
[02:27.98]I'll be back.
[02:29.63]And then we'll do normal streams for probably like a week or two.
[02:32.91]And then I'm going back to Vegas and moved in completely.
[02:37.01]So I just want to make this very clear.
[02:38.37]I'm not disappearing.
[02:41.96]But there are a lot of things that need to get done over this next 30-day period that are way more difficult than I originally thought they ever would be.
[02:52.43]So, for today, we'll just talk about today.
[02:55.07]I can be on the screen for this.
[02:56.85]What is this?
[02:58.73]What is going on here?
[03:01.48]You see what I'm talking about?
[03:04.08]I'm so fucking sorry.
[03:05.64]I'm so sorry.
[03:06.74]I'm so sorry.
[03:11.62]Do I dye?
[03:12.18]I don't dye my hair.
[03:12.98]It's a natural goddamn blonde.
[03:18.55]I just tried to say brown, but it's blonde.
[03:20.49]But what is going on here?
[03:26.12]Is my graphics card broken?
[03:27.50]Why am I artifacting?
[03:31.84]What's going on with my GPU?
[03:40.23]Anyways, so... I need to fix this.
[03:49.92]That's not going to do anything.
[03:51.53]Whatever.
[03:52.03]I'm just really shiny from the neck down right now.
[03:55.55]But... Shave my face.
[03:58.47]I haven't had time to do that.
[04:00.45]I haven't had time to shave my face.
[04:01.57]I haven't had time to shave my teeth.
[04:02.63]You know, you get the hair on your teeth, you gotta shave them.
[04:07.20]How does the sun work?
[04:09.72]It's a never-ending sequence of explosions and implosions inside of one small area that...
[04:19.26]puts off gastric light, which allows us then to have crops.
[04:23.59]And then we eat the crops, and the cows eat the crops, and then you eat the cow.
[04:29.51]I think.
[04:33.12]It's a series of explosions.
[04:34.46]But anyway, so today, you might look at the screen right now and be like, what's going on back here?
[04:39.36]What is enhanced computer?
[04:42.17]This is just, we're only going to be live for like an hour or two tonight.
[04:46.22]And I'm sorry, but I had a window over the last two days to stream, and it's right now.
[04:51.78]Otto's got an appointment in like two hours at 7 p.m.
[04:57.72]No, 4, 5, 6, 7 p.m.
[04:59.16]Otto has an appointment because he needs to be cleared to go on an airplane.
[05:04.25]And then this is the window that I got right now.
[05:08.17]I will be live tomorrow, though, before leaving.
[05:12.08]So tomorrow, me and Etalyx are going to do a co-op stream.
[05:15.82]I don't think you want to miss that one.
[05:17.62]Yeah, me and Etalyx are going to do a game together.
[05:19.72]So we'll try to go as long as we can.
[05:24.16]Give Otto a pet?
[05:24.86]I will.
[05:26.30]But today, again, I do have to apologize that it's been, obviously this week, there hasn't been very many streams.
[05:35.40]And this is two hours of, hey, I've been here for two hours.
[05:38.94]See you later.
[05:39.80]Whatever.
[05:40.72]You see my new graphics card yet?
[05:42.54]No.
[05:45.91]I just can't.
[05:47.19]And I knew this was going to happen.
[05:48.37]I knew eventually it was going to happen.
[05:51.65]But I hate it.
[05:52.65]I hate not being able to stream.
[05:55.35]And it's going to drive me crazy over the next 30 days.
[05:58.54]Trust me on that.
[06:00.92]But we can beat that dead horse as long as we want.
[06:05.30]Why don't we talk about the fact that you just made 75 cents?
[06:10.84]That's right, you.
[06:13.54]Sitting in the front row right here.
[06:15.52]That's right, man.
[06:16.76]Yeah.
[06:17.90]Yep.
[06:18.64]Come on up here.
[06:19.14]Give him a hand.
[06:19.54]Give him a round of applause, guys.
[06:20.42]Thanks for his participation.
[06:21.38]Thank you, dude.
[06:24.04]Oh, you dropped it.
[06:24.78]You dropped something.
[06:25.38]But go sit back down in your seat.
[06:27.42]Audience, give him a round of applause.
[06:32.87]Anyways, let's play Enhanced Computer for like an hour.
[06:40.11]This might not even take an hour, but we're gonna just hang out, alright?
[06:42.65]So, you know.
[06:45.77]I don't know how this works.
[06:46.55]I know it listens to my voice.
[06:47.75]I'll read it very carefully.
[06:53.36]Somebody calling me dad?
[06:58.54]You donated bits before.
[06:59.54]Well, we're still gonna do the bits.
[07:01.42]That's not gonna change.
[07:03.20]The stream in total is only going to be like two and a half hours.
[07:07.52]So I'm prepared for this.
[07:10.24]Anywho, so hello, Detective Cyber.
[07:13.68]You've logged into Enhance.Computer, the world's most advanced image enhancement software.
[07:18.83]Our crime-predicting AI has detected that someone is about to commit an offense against the law.
[07:23.69]The only way to stop it is to find a secret four-letter code hidden in a photograph on the scene.
[07:30.89]What do you mean?
[07:31.43]Why are you laughing about prepared?
[07:36.03]Of course I'm not prepared.
[07:38.83]Isn't that very clear by the fact that I can only stream for two hours in the last three days?
[07:44.03]Of course I'm not.
[07:45.91]It should be very obvious.
[07:47.83]So, use enhance computer by speaking out loud with your voice.
[07:53.77]You can give verbal commands such as move up, zoom in, let's enhance.
[07:57.54]When you find the secret code, you must announce the code is blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, before time runs out.
[08:05.57]Our national security is at risk, and only I can save us.
[08:11.43]Am I about to enter an adult website?

[30:52.83]Thick password.
[30:55.30]I love how the glare is now.
[30:56.64]You can't even see me now.
[30:57.64]I have to turn this back on.
[30:58.72]Alright, hold on a minute.
[31:03.12]I want to do the other thing.
[31:06.91]Turn this off for a second.
[31:08.83]Okay, hold on.
[31:09.39]Let me get this right.
[31:11.47]It's the game where you have to determine what has more Google searches.
[31:14.97]You guys ever played this?
[31:16.67]It gives you two topics and you have to say that this has more or less Google searches than the thing next to it.
[31:21.66]I forget what it was called.
[31:22.48]What's it called?
[31:22.94]What's the game called?
[31:25.88]Shut the blinds?
[31:26.64]I can't.
[31:26.98]They don't exist.
[31:27.52]It's like a higher or lower, what is it called?
[31:33.12]Google search game, whatever the hell it is.
[31:40.82]Higher or lower.
[31:42.36]Yeah, I think this is it.
[31:43.38]Yeah, this is it.
[31:43.96]Well, who's the naked guy?
[31:49.23]Okay, yeah, so here we go.
[31:50.27]This is what I was talking about.
[31:53.53]So you have to determine
[31:57.19]Uh, does, does the, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[32:02.93]So Prague has 823,000 average monthly searches.
[32:08.88]Uh, does, does Disneyland have more monthly searches than Prague?
[32:15.10]Have we got to get some royalty free music?
[32:16.56]That's true.
[32:17.26]Hold on.
[32:17.90]Let's just wait a minute here.
[32:23.64]Royalty free YouTuber music.
[32:27.78]I'm going to say Disneyland.
[32:28.80]You know how many people plan Disneyland trips?
[32:31.46]More than a million people.
[32:32.39]You know how many people wish they could plan a Disneyland trip?
[32:35.39]Like 10 million people.
[32:37.37]That's higher.
[32:38.01]See what I'm talking about?
[32:42.11]Like people search like Disneyland trips without even going.
[32:47.43]Alright.
[32:47.95]Royalty free YouTuber music.
[32:54.00]No copyright music.
[32:59.69]Let's go with this one just right here.
[33:05.49]Free music.
[33:08.71]So this one is called Somewhere in Nature.
[33:16.18]No.
[33:17.88]This one's called Smile.
[33:18.86]I don't like that one either.
[33:23.93]This one's called Adventures.
[33:25.19]This one would be my favorite.
[33:29.35]okay yeah you guys can't even hear it okay well there we go now I don't know if I like this we're gonna keep it though alright does disneyland have more or less searches than the term epilepsy I'm gonna say lower I still think disneyland is king here I'm not having the music lower yeah I mean the epilepsy obviously is a very uh okay epilepsy or malcolm x
[33:59.22]Does it have more or less than epilepsy?
[34:03.98]Ah.
[34:05.44]I would, hmm.
[34:06.24]I don't know, because I feel like when you, just in general, right?
[34:13.05]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[34:15.99]This facecam is just fucking terrible.
[34:19.03]Who do I think I am?
[34:25.94]That's way too, no, no, right here.
[34:28.30]That's fine.
[34:29.30]Right.
[34:30.14]That's fine.
[34:31.34]It doesn't matter if like half my face is blown out.
[34:34.34]Who gives a shit?
[34:36.91]Alright.
[34:37.17]But so I'm obviously you have a prominent like public figure, right.
[34:42.07]Versus a illness.
[34:44.89]I feel like it's gonna be close, but I think I still think epilepsy might be a little higher.
[34:56.13]just because I'm gonna go with my gut here.
[34:58.59]I think epilepsy is higher.
[35:07.45]I think I broke the computer.
[35:27.78]My gut sucks.
[35:28.50]I mean, it does.
[35:29.22]You're right.
[35:30.46]Like, literally, physically.
[35:40.23]Hold on.
[35:40.49]I mean, you got that right.
[35:44.69]Oh, I know why the webcam looks like shit.
[35:46.33]It's because it's the shitty one.
[35:47.79]The other ones, I've been deleting all kinds of stuff.
[35:53.38]Okay.
[35:57.05]is the bad one this is this is the uh I have a like a 1080p one and then like a 720p one and that's the jokey skype grandma 720p by the way that's not real 720p this is the 720p that your mother and your grandmother think is 720p which is just 480p that they went like this and wow the image is bigger therefore it's better that's not what it means no no no don't fall for that
[36:26.56]This is how big it's supposed to be.
[36:29.07]Who cares?
[36:29.65]Alright, let's look up copyright music on YouTube.
[36:35.41]No, non-copyright music.
[36:38.05]Why am I trying to do this again?
[36:42.91]Who cares?
[36:43.65]Who cares?
[36:44.07]I don't care.
[36:45.03]Alright, this one's just staying on.
[36:49.01]Just pretend I'm doing a vlog.
[36:51.81]And why is my fucking computer not working?
[36:55.06]Okay, higher, lower, there we go.
[37:01.20]Put on the doom sound, I will in a minute.
[37:03.10]Alright, does the Bible have more monthly searches than find my iPhone?
[37:11.58]I think, I don't know man, a lot of people lose their phones.
[37:16.55]But it's the Bible.
[37:17.83]So... Even if this is... It's lower.
[37:20.91]Holy shit, that was close.
[37:22.18]But we got it.
[37:22.74]Alright, does Find My iPhone have more or less than Wells Fargo, the bank?
[37:27.58]Way lower.
[37:28.28]Nobody's looking.
[37:28.72]Why are you searching for a bank?
[37:31.63]Oh!
[37:47.90]16 million monthly searches for what that many people take out mortgages American express 6.1 million versus reservoir dogs is probably like a hundred thousand yeah it's way less so this is how it gets easier right okay here's the problem right so you have reservoir dogs old kind of cult classic movie versus uh luis suarez I don't know who this is so therefore I'm part of the people that would not have looked up this person's name
[38:16.84]That's okay.
[38:17.52]Like... I don't know why it keeps giving me this naked guy.
[38:22.78]But it won't really... I thought this was... What the fuck is going on here?
[38:27.08]Alright.
[38:27.40]Snakes and Ladders, the board game, versus Sergio Aguero.
[38:31.71]I don't know who that is, but judging by the last one, we're going to have to say higher.
[38:35.09]God damn it!
[38:35.85]Oh, I forgot the Doom soundtrack.
[38:46.65]So why, what, is he that much more popular than the, I don't understand.
[38:50.28]He's that much less popular?
[38:51.46]This is, by the way, this is picking up exactly where it left off in the Labo stream.
[38:59.72]It's getting hard to concentrate with this music on.
[39:01.48]Nah, that's fine.
[39:08.17]Just something in the background.
[39:11.27]And I don't like the fact that I have to reload the page every time.
[39:13.43]Why the fuck do I have to do that?
[39:15.79]Okay.
[39:16.43]Does Eduardo Mangiarotti with 590 active searches versus iTunes.
[39:29.78]This is probably like 50 million.
[39:32.54]Yeah, way more.
[39:33.44]Come on.
[39:33.88]Lower?
[39:34.36]What?
[39:36.00]Alright.
[39:36.46]iTunes versus Solitaire.
[39:37.74]Nobody plays Solitaire anymore.
[39:39.99]People play Fortnite.
[39:40.99]It's free.
[39:41.75]God damn it.
[39:50.39]Okay, Jim Brown versus the Golden State Warriors.
[39:52.85]The Golden State Warriors by far, without a doubt.
[39:57.67]Golden State Warriors versus Dr. Dre.
[39:59.43]Now, this is tricky, because Dr. Dre, he's like a really, really entrepreneur, huge musician.
[40:10.06]But what was the last album?
[40:11.68]What's the last thing Dr. Dre did?
[40:16.82]Is he still relevant?
[40:18.68]Is he?
[40:20.03]More than the Golden State Warriors.
[40:23.17]That's what I'm talking about, guys.
[40:24.17]See, look, 550K.
[40:27.39]Bobby Orr, Boston's finest.
[40:29.94]Fuck me.
[40:31.98]I should have known.
[40:32.58]There's only like 25 people that actually give a fuck that Bobby Orr played hockey.
[40:42.87]Chicago vol vol the Chicago vols like the Chicago bulls million monthly active searches versus beauty salon this is going to be close but I still think the Chicago bulls yeah no not even close
[41:08.35]Alright, these are equal.
[41:09.43]I think these are both equal.
[41:11.07]Because if you search for the Empire State Building, you're doing one of two things.
[41:14.87]You are, hey honey, we're planning our little trip here and we have to go to the Empire State Building.
[41:19.72]Or you're typing in, what's the tallest buildings in America?
[41:23.22]Right?
[41:23.46]Like, Empire State Building, how big are you?
[41:25.68]Nobody else searches for this for any other reason.
[41:27.22]It's lower.
[41:32.23]Whatever.
[41:39.37]Mobile Strike, the Arnold Schwarzenegger video game versus eating disorders.
[41:51.87]Again, I think this is going to be close.
[41:56.07]But remember, free on the App Store.
[41:59.79]Like mobile, you know.
[42:03.19]Lower.
[42:04.15]Yeah, OK.
[42:05.75]Still in the same realm, I think.
[42:08.26]Uh, Ha Long Bay.
[42:13.10]This is a specific place.
[42:16.62]Like, let's put it this way.
[42:17.75]How many of you guys in the chat have ever searched for that word?
[42:20.61]Ever searched for Ha Long Bay in your life?
[42:24.67]You think it's higher?
[42:25.37]Me.
[42:28.19]Me, no you haven't.
[42:30.66]Is it 200,000 searches a month?
[42:35.46]Where's our Doom soundtrack?
[42:38.74]There it is, finally, Jesus.
[42:44.84]I don't, I think it's lower.
[42:46.52]Oh God, damn it.
[42:49.61]By 30,000, unbelievable.
[42:52.73]It was, that's pretty much the same.
[42:53.87]Alright, Blacksmith versus Barcelona.
[43:01.10]This is the thing you look up when you want to see how things used to be made.
[43:04.25]Or, but I don't know, because people are writing like, can I add like World of Warcraft or like Final Fantasy Online to this?
[43:12.03]Because how many people have searched Blacksmith's World of Warcraft recipe?
[43:17.37]Versus Barcelona hire.
[43:19.11]Yeah.
[43:24.37]Barcelona versus How I Met Your Mother.
[43:27.18]Way lower.
[43:29.05]I'm shocked that that many people have searched for that this month.
[43:32.99]The show's been off TV for like four years.
[43:37.36]How I Met Your Mother was Pan's Labyrinth.
[43:41.22]Del Toro is still kind of, he's very relevant right now, so I could imagine it would be close.
[43:47.09]No, not even close.
[43:59.14]Billy Joel has a lot of classic wedding songs.
[44:04.98]Billy Joel versus Welder.
[44:06.76]Does Welder have more than Billy Joel?
[44:09.14]Well, no.
[44:13.04]No.
[44:13.84]Okay, we beat the high score.
[44:14.70]Our high score is two.
[44:16.22]Welder versus American... Holy shit, I did that.
[44:19.26]I just knee-jerked that.
[44:20.98]I thought that was going to be like five million.
[44:23.90]America's Got Talent versus Bo Jackson.
[44:31.86]I'm going to say lower, but... Yeah, okay.
[44:36.53]America's Got Talent.
[44:39.21]Bro Jackson versus poor.
[44:43.75]That's 110.
[44:44.01]Poor versus making a murderer.
[45:00.93]I don't know, man.
[45:02.01]Making a murder was like something that people watched a lot.
[45:04.41]And like, do people still watch this and search for this?
[45:06.69]It's like an old Netflix series from like years ago.
[45:14.92]Whatever.
[45:23.52]I just freaked out.
[45:26.04]I was like, no, don't show it.
[45:29.25]I thought that was mine.
[45:33.97]Give me a mini heart attack.
[45:37.39]Nobody fucking searches for air hockey.
[45:42.13]Air hockey versus Oman.
[45:46.63]Air hockey doesn't even exist anymore.
[45:49.13]Wembley Stadium versus Oman.
[45:52.53]$5.50.
[45:52.75]I need gentler music than this.
[45:55.69]Does Doom have a gentler soundtrack?
[45:59.77]I'm dead serious.
[46:00.39]Is there like a Doom elevator music or something?
[46:13.06]Doom.
[46:15.32]No.
[46:19.92]Yeah, it's called Mood.
[46:22.32]The Killing Floor 2 soundtrack.
[46:23.86]No, I need something to calm me down and be able to think.
[46:27.50]Bentley Stadium.
[46:34.58]Red Dead Redemption?
[46:35.36]That's actually a pretty good idea.
[46:36.72]Red Dead Redemption soundtrack.
[46:41.12]That sounds great.
[46:46.41]Yeah, there it is.
[46:48.91]Hold on, hold on.
[46:51.35]Okay, that's good.
[46:52.57]I'm alright with this.
[46:55.33]Okay, so we got Lionel Richie versus Microsoft Word.
[46:57.69]I mean, people write projects.
[47:01.17]What?
[47:02.22]Microsoft Word versus Tesla.
[47:03.88]Well, considering all the crazy shit that's been going on with Tesla and Elon Musk.
[47:11.16]I thought it might be low, but oh man, this is tough because...
[47:19.02]Mm-hmm.
[47:20.20]That's a good call.
[47:20.88]That's a good call.
[47:22.88]Tesla, Oscar Wilde, no way.
[47:24.90]Tesla beats it by a mile.
[47:28.08]Oscar Wilde or a Shih Tzu?
[47:33.21]I mean, they kind of have the same haircut.
[47:35.31]Does that mean they're the same?
[47:38.37]Like, this is kind of... That's my hair.
[47:41.25]I had that hair.
[47:54.89]There's so many weird dog people that... Yeah.
[48:00.16]I just thought of everybody that I knew that owned a Shih Tzu and how many times a month they'd probably type in the dog of their breed into Google every month.
[48:06.70]And it's at least 100.
[48:07.20]H&M is going under.
[48:10.47]Whoa-ho!
[48:23.19]that's the most more than Disneyland more than Microsoft Word more than Disneyland why are that many people searching for H&M that store sucks no way Houdini no way
[48:47.11]Houdini versus Spectre.
[48:48.80]Oh, I was... Okay, I thought this... That's a James Bond movie, right?
[48:52.56]This has got to be a little higher than Houdini.
[48:56.12]Manchester by the Sea versus Spectre.
[49:07.17]Mm-hmm.
[49:08.54]Yep.
[49:10.26]David beckham he's nobody cares anymore about him apparently remember when he was the biggest thing in the world 10 years ago that would have been like 200 million online searches that's it you gotta remember it's average monthly searches it's not like all time it's not daily it's what's going on this month you know what's happening now the godfather versus actual god
[49:37.17]Should I bet against... Which one's the real God, do you think?
[49:42.55]Holy shit!
[49:45.25]More people searched for H&M this month by a factor of nearly 30 than they searched for God.
[49:57.56]Yeah, no way.
[50:00.70]I don't know who that is, but judging by sports, it has to be at least 100,000, right?
[50:10.12]Is this a rugby team?
[50:12.43]That's rugby.
[50:14.17]Yeah, sorry.
[50:17.11]Joe Frazier, higher for sure.
[50:18.59]What?
[50:21.05]What?
[50:29.08]Fucking legendary.
[50:30.68]Legendary Joe Frazier.
[50:35.26]Greek salad versus flute.
[50:38.43]Who plays the flute anymore?

[50:40.69]Fucking god damn it.
[50:46.02]Buddhism for all the planet.
[50:48.40]I gotta always bet against my Boston, you know.
[50:52.21]I gotta bet against Boston every time it comes up.
[50:56.07]Here's the weird thing though, right?
[50:59.76]Why... Why are people still searching for The Departed?
[51:03.63]I just imagine it's some guy with, like, a backwards Boston Red Sox baseball hat on.
[51:07.73]Just, he searches, he watches the movie, like, every week.
[51:11.37]What's that fucking movie that I like?
[51:12.67]Oh, The Departed.
[51:13.31]There it is.
[51:13.73]Yeah, I'm gonna rent that on iTunes again this week.
[51:19.37]300,000 people?
[51:22.87]I wonder how many Bostonians dedicate, like, 10% of their income to renting The Departed every week.
[51:30.10]I mean, it's probably a significant amount.
[51:34.04]Heineken.
[51:36.38]Of course, it's a beer.
[51:37.66]People start puberty.
[51:38.70]Now we've got maybe a lot of young people searching for this term.
[51:43.82]Versus a lot of older people searching for this term.
[51:46.58]But you also have a lot of young people who are also searching for this term because they can't do it yet lower.
[51:53.13]See?
[51:56.53]Puberty versus the Toronto Raptors higher.
[52:01.44]meditation okay screaming in a room versus sitting uh on on the ground and thinking to yourself two polar opposites here I think this is way higher it was identical Pokémon go this but this is no but this is not cool anymore right
[52:27.84]maybe like nine or maybe like eight or nine months ago I would say higher not this month oh my god do people don't what 20 million people search for Pokémon go 20 million this month no one's like talking about that game anymore jackie chan always always bet on jackie chan no matter what the scenario is
[52:54.44]See?

[52:55.50]Because I bet on Jackie Chan under any circumstance.
[53:00.36]Always bet on Jackie Chan.
[53:01.82]See?
[53:04.10]Jackie Chan versus Moses.
[53:05.90]Always bet on Jackie Chan.
[53:12.34]I mean, come on.
[53:12.86]It's Usher.
[53:13.35]What do you want me to tell you?
[53:24.06]I don't know.
[53:27.08]I don't know.

[86:30.57]So it takes about, I got to give myself like about 25 minutes.
[86:35.71]So I got about 25-ish minutes right here, like 20 minutes.
[86:43.16]It's up just about 6 o'clock.
[86:46.50]Play Saints Row.
[86:49.32]Saints Row.
[86:51.90]That's what we're going to do.
[86:52.92]Am I going to read you guys like a fucking nursery rhyme or something for like 20 minutes?
[86:59.86]Google Feud.
[87:01.14]Oh, that's right.
[87:01.80]I got too sucked into the other ones.
[87:03.61]I don't want to get into Google.
[87:04.51]Am I sweating here?
[87:06.49]Yeah.
[87:07.75]Don't worry.
[87:08.13]It's fine.
[87:08.71]It happens.
[87:09.07]It's a natural thing that you do too.
[87:10.71]You do it.
[87:11.55]Let's see.
[87:11.91]You do it.
[87:13.49]You do it.
[87:16.78]You do it.
[87:17.24]Let's see.
[87:19.84]Oh, yeah.
[87:21.28]Fucking gross, dude.
[87:25.24]But anyways, just to give you a little recap of what's going on here.
[87:30.10]I'm gone this week.
[87:32.46]I'm not coming back until well into next week.
[87:36.42]So I'm going to try to do a stream from Las Vegas.
[87:40.89]I'm going to try depending on if I can get my, I might like blow through all my data.
[87:45.43]The stream from Las Vegas might be like 15 minutes.
[87:49.65]I'm going to like be like, Oh, this is great.
[87:51.17]Yeah.
[87:51.75]Live with like 3000 up and 20 minutes later I get like a fucking $200 bill.
[87:59.21]I just called you gross.
[88:00.09]I didn't call you gross.
[88:01.10]I called the thing that was under your arm gross because I mean, come on gross.
[88:06.20]Um, but
[88:09.55]Sorry, we're going to do a really short stream tonight.
[88:12.62]I'll be live tomorrow.
[88:15.46]I'll be live tomorrow.
[88:17.34]Me and Etalyx are going to play... I think we're going to go back to that weird... That game that just added the Yeti.
[88:26.92]The one we used to chase Bigfoot around and now they added a snow map.
[88:31.58]We're going to play that tomorrow for a few hours.
[88:34.77]So...
[88:38.60]and then you'll see me maybe at some point over the weekend I don't know I can't guarantee it I'll try and then we it becomes real this week it's it's a it's real now whereas before it was kind of like this is what I'm doing this is what I'm doing this is what I'm doing this what I'm doing it's real so uh I think for the purposes of just making sure that I can get out here in time uh
[89:03.54]because Otto needs to get his documents to be able to ride a plane.
[89:06.78]I'm planning on probably flying out.
[89:08.24]I'm not flying out.
[89:08.96]Am I gonna drive?
[89:09.56]I'm not gonna drive.
[89:10.22]It's just, it's still kind of up in the air, but I think I'm gonna just fly out there.
[89:16.93]So I need Otto to get a kind of pass to be able to fly.
[89:25.28]Music making stream has been indefinitely postponed.
[89:28.23]Well, until I get back.
[89:30.41]I mean, next week is nothing, right?
[89:33.73]The rest of this week, essentially, into next week is nothing going to be going on.
[89:39.02]But I come back for two or three weeks because I still have to finish up here.
[89:44.26]And then it's going back to Vegas.
[89:47.48]So going back to Vegas probably... I don't know.
[89:51.08]I don't know when the date is for our start.
[89:54.18]For when we're going to be on move-in date.
[89:55.58]I just don't have it yet because I don't have it.
[89:58.82]It's really hard to go across the fucking country and get a place to live.
[90:03.58]It's just kind of... I've worked with like four realtors at this point for moving to Vegas and they've all said the same thing.
[90:13.19]You know, it's just really hard, you know, to get you out here.
[90:17.77]We don't usually do.
[90:18.75]Out of state is so difficult.
[90:19.91]And I understand what they're trying to tell me.
[90:23.87]Auto appointment.
[90:24.39]Yeah, I'm good.
[90:24.85]I'm good.
[90:27.34]I don't, you know, like to work with people from out of state because, you know, and I feel like a lot of people maybe just use realtors as tour guides.
[90:34.40]They go to Vegas.
[90:35.52]Oh, let's go to Vegas.
[90:36.32]Let's look at some houses, too.
[90:37.82]Hey, can you show us around?
[90:38.90]We're here for the fucking bachelorette party.
[90:42.04]I don't know.
[90:44.11]But that's the plan.
[90:47.05]I'll see you guys tomorrow if you're going to leave.
[90:50.25]Again, stream was short tonight.
[90:53.20]Sorry, but this is, like I said, the only real window I had to stream in the last few days.
[90:58.18]Just go, go.
[90:58.94]No, I'm okay.
[90:59.54]I'm alright.
[91:00.16]It's six o'clock.
[91:00.82]We can read the bits and hang out for a minute.
[91:02.30]Let's do the fucking subs, man.
[91:03.74]Come on.

[94:16.16]I'm sorry.
[94:16.60]That was your name.
[94:17.38]I'm very sorry.
[94:18.00]My brain just couldn't do it tonight.
[94:21.20]But thank you guys so much.
[94:26.57]Yagia D9.
[94:28.65]That's easy to read.
[94:34.51]You guys caught my creepy laugh face.
[94:36.67]That's why I don't like having the facecam on.
[94:38.17]I just switched over and I'm like... I'm a fucking creep.
[94:44.12]Anyways.
[94:46.70]Why no facecam?
[94:47.50]Why don't you have your facecam on, dude?
[94:49.90]Because my face is shaped like a banana.
[94:58.96]That's why.
[95:01.23]Alright, so we got a... Let's do the bits.
[95:06.87]Starting with a man boy.
[95:10.87]I don't even have this thing on.
[95:15.28]Like, whatever.
[95:15.82]I'll have it on.
[95:16.96]Who cares?
[95:19.38]Thank you, manboy777 for the dollar 15.
[95:21.18]Hey, Jerma, after I saw The Sims stream, I knew I had to make this video or I wouldn't be able to get it out of my head.
[95:27.45]Here it is.
[95:29.35]I need to make this video.
[95:31.43]That's what they say.
[95:32.01]Oh, my God.
[95:38.87]Okay, hold on.
[95:41.83]I got to put this on the screen because this seems kind of insane.
[95:50.25]Let me turn the volume back up.
[95:55.95]That was the video.
[95:56.65]He wanted me to watch this video.
[96:07.79]So no one told you life was gonna be this way Your job's a joke, you broke your block, lost your way It's like you're always stuck in second gear When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year But I'll be there for you When the rain starts to fall, I'll be there for you
[96:43.09]Why is he- Why is he- Oh my god.
[96:46.20]There's Wally Wee!
[96:51.02]I'd watch every episode.
[97:23.45]Oh god.
[97:24.15]He gets his own title card.
[97:26.53]This took a lot of time to make.
[98:00.37]Just starts in like cleaning.
[98:09.84]Did you get the whole thing right?
[98:11.52]You gotta love people in the bath.
[98:36.73]The house is just on fire?
[98:45.97]Spoilers.
[98:47.63]Oh, there they are with the dogs!
[98:58.44]That was great.
[98:59.02]Here he is again, right?
[99:01.59]That was great.
[99:04.13]You see what I'm talking about?
[99:05.35]I have to just delete this.
[99:07.65]How do I delete somebody else's stream live of me?
[99:16.52]No, that was great, man.
[99:17.76]Thanks.
[99:20.76]You really nailed it.
[99:21.64]You really nailed it.
[99:23.90]Link?
[99:24.14]Here's a link.
[99:24.64]Hold on.
[99:25.98]I'll get it to you.
[99:31.84]Where the hell is it?
[99:32.82]There it is.
[99:42.64]There you go.
[99:43.56]It's linked to The Sims Friends intro.
[99:47.50]Thanks a lot, dude.
[99:50.14]Manboy, fantastic job.
[99:52.03]Thank you for sharing that.
[99:53.95]Chubby Kitten, thanks for the $1.10.
[99:55.47]Good luck with the move, Jeremy.
[99:56.31]Hope everything goes well.
[99:57.19]I hate moving.
[99:57.81]I can't imagine moving states away.
[100:00.92]Thank you.
[100:01.76]Yeah, it's going to be one of those scenarios where it's thousands of miles away.
[100:09.07]So it sucks.
[100:10.53]It would be a lot different if I was just getting in a car and driving like three or four hours, but that's not the case.
[100:15.25]So got to deal with it, though.
[100:17.76]I'll do it.
[100:18.14]I'll be good.
[100:18.98]Thank you, though.
[100:20.96]N Pudding, thanks for the $1.
[100:22.08]You're a pretty cool dude.
[100:24.84]Thanks a lot.
[100:26.85]You sound pretty cool too, from my understanding of this message.
[100:34.52]I moved from France to Canada and sent my stuff by boat.
[100:37.72]It took a month to arrive.
[100:38.92]That's another problem, man.
[100:40.08]That's why I want to bring all my shit with me.
[100:43.10]Moving companies, I heard horror stories.
[100:45.42]I'm hearing horror stories of, oh yeah, the moving company is supposed to be here.
[100:50.34]Oh yeah, a month later, my stuff shows up.
[100:52.82]I need my fucking pewter, man.
[100:54.52]I need my pewter.
[100:56.99]hell am I going to do without my computer for like a month coming with me you thought Canada was France that's not what no but thank you though thank you kill code for the one dollar hey do you have a business email or any way I could contact you outside of bit donations I wanted to ask you a couple of things um Discord Discord uh
[101:23.16]I think I've tried Discord's weird because I tried to uh I've tried to dm people on Discord and I haven't really been able to sometimes it's just like oh you can't that person doesn't allow it or you don't share a server which I have the thing enabled that says I can so but Discord I'll add you on Discord that sounds probably the best way to do it so thank you kill code
[101:52.35]Open up DMs.
[101:53.47]Remember, it has to be on your end, too.
[101:55.15]Because if I contact you, you know, it's got to be enabled on your end.
[102:00.91]Mostly lost thanks to the $1.
[102:02.01]I love how I can't watch the stream with audio on, but I can still vaguely tell what's happening based off the stream of Jerma IQs and Jerma Plutos.
[102:10.14]Now, I guess you could have just watched this without any audio at all.
[102:13.54]You'd still be able to get what was going on.
[102:16.51]Uh, Atrolux, Atrox, thanks for the one dollar.
[102:18.17]JermaJoop, JermaJoop2.
[102:20.19]Did you get it?
[102:21.33]It's a dollar from Atrolux again.
[102:22.75]JermaJoop, JermaJoop3 and 4.
[102:25.15]Did they get a donation, Joop, here?
[102:31.16]I've tried to repeatedly DM you.
[102:32.64]Well, here's another thing, guys.
[102:33.56]I have my DMs turned off.
[102:35.78]And I, like, enabled them very specifically because if I had my DMs enabled...
[102:43.24]I gotta protect myself from spam.
[102:45.34]People could just like, there's like thousands of people that go to that Discord, right?
[102:50.32]I could imagine like opening the browser and it's just like, so I can't.
[102:59.77]Stop saying Jupe.
[103:03.01]Jupiter.
[103:05.34]We already talked about this.
[103:06.80]We already went over this.
[103:07.90]It's a jup.
[103:09.70]It's not a jup.
[103:10.82]That's not how you say it.
[103:12.04]Jupiter.
[103:12.98]It's not Jupiter.
[103:15.72]That is the set in stone way that it's going to be said.
[103:23.03]I was going for a fist bump.
[103:29.75]I wasn't going to like... Like not a... I was going for a...
[103:34.39]difference huge difference you understand there's a difference between and huge difference and you know what I mean by that uh but thank you ancient sasquatch for the one dollar this will cover first class for you in auto right uh a dollar I mean thanks that's to it
[104:00.37]Stop punching me.
[104:01.75]Thank you, Ancient Sasquatch.
[104:04.35]Thank you, Bake Me Home for the $1.
[104:06.95]They say, jermaChomp, Buck, Star Rex.
[104:13.27]What are his emotes?
[104:13.87]I don't even know what his emotes are.
[104:17.43]Something about a T-Rex with Star's face on it.
[104:22.30]Get on it.
[104:23.46]Hey, Peter.
[104:24.06]Thanks for the three bucks, Peter.
[104:25.08]They say, Zoomin'.
[104:26.88]Thank you, Peter.
[104:28.74]Vegas is really pushing for a lot of sports.
[104:30.24]If you don't know, the Raiders are now the Vegas Raiders, and they're building a stadium.
[104:50.67]for that team as well so Vegas is really trying to start to get into the sports thing not a huge hockey fan and not really a huge American football fan but nonetheless would be interesting to see but thank you roose roose thank you uh guy on the left right that's what you said
[105:10.29]Vertiquid, Vertical, thanks for the two bucks.
[105:12.33]Glad to see things are falling into place.
[105:14.43]I don't know if I'll be able to catch your upcoming stream, so I just want to say now that I hope the move goes smoothly from here on out.
[105:19.98]I'll catch you later.
[105:21.96]Love you and take care.
[105:23.78]Appreciate the kind words.
[105:27.06]It's going to be hectic, but something I've wanted to do for a long time, something that I need to do.
[105:32.98]Appreciate the... I appreciate the encouraging words.
[105:36.88]Thank you so much.
[105:39.04]And every day it gets more real.
[105:40.78]So if I seem a little stressed out about it, it's because I am.
[105:46.38]Do a Golden Knights live stream?
[105:47.98]I can't.
[105:48.42]What?
[105:49.80]You want me to play on the Golden Knights?
[105:51.66]You want me to try out, audition for, and play?
[105:54.06]Guys, it's not like America's Got Talent.
[105:55.95]I can't just go audition to play on the Golden Knights.
[105:59.69]I would just go for a slap shot every fucking time.
[106:02.19]You know what I mean?
[106:02.63]Like I'd be the guy in the Mighty Ducks, right?
[106:04.69]They just, I'm the guy with the super power that does the super slap shot.
[106:08.16]That's all I do.
[106:09.04]I don't do anything else.
[106:10.80]Remember like hockey, how everyone had like, should I have power?
[106:14.02]Where are the powers now?
[106:18.14]Hey, thanks Garf for the Monday killer for the $1.
[106:20.88]Thanks for the 75 cents, Jerma, my lad.
[106:23.66]I finally get to see you use my dusty old Garf tokens to add up to a dollar.
[106:28.68]I'm making some progress on the Jerma Cinematic Universe, but it's not going to be easy.
[106:32.36]I'm getting Odie to help me out with the voice acting.
[106:34.46]You'll see when you see it.
[106:35.32]Jerma, my man.
[106:37.54]It'll be the best PowerPoint presentation you've ever seen.
[106:41.78]And here is the latest Garfield comic book.
[106:45.29]Check it out.
[106:46.33]DK Donkey Kong.
[106:48.95]The second member of the DK crew.
[106:50.25]You got a stout.
[106:51.89]She's a little stout.
[106:53.41]He hates Garfield so much.
[106:57.66]No, I'm just having a little bit of fun play here.
[106:59.86]I guess fun is subjective.
[107:03.94]Imagine being a Bruins fan.
[107:05.20]I'm not a Bruins fan.
[107:06.96]I don't watch hockey.
[107:08.14]I don't keep up.
[107:11.58]I gotta turn the lights up.
[107:14.27]This is weird.
[107:16.39]Whatever.
[107:16.85]We're almost done.
[107:18.65]Thank you, Garfield.
[107:20.23]Hold on.
[107:20.51]What's going on with my eye?
[107:25.27]My eye just tried to look that way.
[107:30.66]I'm gonna go like frog-eyed on stream.
[107:33.89]That'll be embarrassing.
[107:36.27]Here's the worst part about being on a camera, because let's just briefly talk about this.
[107:41.22]Because every moment of every second, and I'm going to prove this to you on stream.
[107:45.32]It doesn't matter what you're doing.
[107:46.88]It doesn't matter what you're saying.
[107:48.18]You could be doing anything you want.
[107:49.16]You could be saying, talking, going over a story, anything, right?
[107:52.46]Who cares?
[107:53.84]Everything.
[107:54.83]I'm taking a bunch of print screens right now.
[107:56.77]All you have to do is then take one of those at any point that I was just speaking.
[108:05.68]Let's take a look.
[108:08.90]My point, here we go.
[108:10.10]This is exactly what I'm talking about.
[108:11.30]You know how many pictures like this exist?
[108:21.01]Right?
[108:21.39]Like this is, every frame can be taken.
[108:32.93]You see what I'm saying?
[108:35.17]So when you have this kind of technology where you can just freeze me.
[108:40.75]Any moment I'm talking, I could do something stupid.
[108:43.59]Like that I don't even realize like a little Twitch or like a tick of my mouth.
[108:46.73]And it's like, oh, what did Jeremy do?
[108:48.89]He was like.
[108:53.30]Get out of here.
[108:55.06]I'm not going to do the thing I do sometimes where I like snap and like move my hand.
[108:58.80]I'm just going to go like this.
[109:00.96]Wrong facecam.
[109:02.36]Wrong one.
[109:02.88]Let's try that again.
[109:08.59]Anyways, thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer, for your $1.
[109:11.11]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[109:12.95]I know you said no more bee videos until after the green screen stream, and that's exactly what I said.
[109:18.62]This one is already dated, and if I wait any longer, you won't remember why I made this.
[109:24.04]Okay.
[109:24.38]One exception.
[109:25.88]This is the only exception.
[109:33.93]This is the only exception.
[109:35.19]Here you go.
[109:36.05]Let's put it on.
[109:48.93]You gotta be fucking kidding me, man.
[110:22.85]That was on point.
[110:24.21]I'm glad I watched it, actually.
[110:25.33]I'm glad we actually watched that.
[110:26.75]That was fucking hilarious.
[110:30.15]Put your hands together.
[110:33.79]Thank you for that, man.
[110:34.83]Thank you, Darkstar.
[110:36.63]Hey, Scripps3, thanks for the $1.
[110:38.17]Hey, Jerma, thanks a ton for finding the time to still stream while doing the move to Vegas.
[110:42.75]By the way, did you end up checking the recommended curation list?
[110:46.11]No, I have not.
[110:47.93]I haven't really had a time to sit at the computer for more than 20 minutes at a time.
[110:52.27]So that's something I will have to do when I get back.
[110:58.82]So thank you for making it, though.
[111:02.82]Something that I have to look at on my return.
[111:06.66]You sat here for two hours.
[111:09.42]Yeah, but I'm like, we're talking, we're doing bits, we're hanging out.
[111:14.97]This is time dedicated to being live on stream.
[111:19.79]Can we get a link?
[111:21.51]Do you have a quick link here that you can throw it in?
[111:25.86]What about auto?
[111:27.76]No, don't put this into the graveyard of I'll look into it.
[111:30.94]No, no, no.
[111:32.60]Don't do that.
[111:33.10]There's only eight minutes left.
[111:39.18]I'm okay.
[111:40.92]As long as I leave here within the next 20 minutes, I'll be fine.
[111:43.58]Thank you, Scripps.
[111:44.62]We'll talk about it when I get back.
[111:47.14]Atrolux, thanks for the $1.
[111:48.42]You need to hear this.
[112:10.81]Did they do YMCA?
[112:38.24]This is really well made.
[113:12.83]Well, that was... That was fucking awesome.
[113:17.71]Thank you for making that.
[113:18.67]Whoever actually made that, that was fucking great.
[113:20.57]Was it you?
[113:20.99]Was it not you?
[113:21.63]Was it whoever it was?
[113:22.43]Good work.
[113:24.98]That's... Thanks for the hit sound.
[113:29.66]Hit sound.
[113:31.50]You're gonna make that whole song a hit sound?
[113:35.24]Some talented person made it.
[113:36.30]That's true.
[113:38.19]That's fucking awesome.
[113:38.85]Thanks.
[113:40.01]Hey, Darkstar, thanks for the $1.
[113:41.30]Jeremy is wrong.
[113:42.22]Streams are my favorite type of streams.
[113:51.42]What?
[113:52.82]But, uh, thank you, Darkstar.
[113:56.19]For the $1.
[113:57.19]Appreciate it, man.
[113:58.59]Hey, Mjit.
[113:59.47]Thanks, Mjit, for the... Thank you, Mjit.
[114:03.39]New to the stream?
[114:04.53]Welcome.
[114:05.79]Hey, Mjit just walked into the door.
[114:11.47]Thank you, MJ.
[114:12.97]Welcome to the stream.
[114:16.37]Thank you to Sly161 for the $1.50.
[114:18.65]I'm 90% sure I was in an elevator with Joe Frazier once a long time ago in Philly.
[114:23.41]He was wearing two hats.
[114:25.93]One over the other.
[114:28.53]Are you serious?
[114:31.29]That's awesome.
[114:34.75]Did you immediately look at him and go, holy shit, fucking incredible guy.
[114:38.85]Wow.
[114:42.28]That sounds like the start of a coffee pasta.
[114:45.25]I was in an elevator and I was wearing these two hats.
[114:54.09]It might be.
[114:54.63]I don't know.
[114:54.99]But if it's true, that's fucking cool.
[114:57.33]Thank you, Sly.
[114:58.35]Thank you.
[114:58.61]It's time for slime for the $5 here.
[115:00.39]Thank you.
[115:00.68]Time for slime.
[115:01.92]Hey, Jerma.
[115:02.28]I was catching up on The Sims 4 VODs and was surprised to see chat still hounding you for not destroying the Labo before you move.
[115:08.44]I decided to help you out a little bit and put this all to rest.
[115:17.68]Let's see.
[115:20.96]We're going to put this all to rest right now.
[115:23.70]Not that.
[115:24.98]This.
[115:41.43]Exploded!
[115:42.37]Exploded!
[115:46.69]That was fucking... Okay, that was great.
[115:53.33]Look at how, like, tough you made me look.
[115:56.75]You squished it, too.
[115:58.04]You actually squished it down.
[116:01.68]That was fucking amazing.
[116:02.74]Here's a lick.
[116:05.76]Thank you, Time for Slime.
[116:06.50]That was fucking awesome.
[116:08.69]And thank you for your $5, too.
[116:09.87]That's all.
[116:11.11]I missed the whole thing.
[116:12.01]Just click on that link and be aware of the awesome that that video emanates.
[116:17.87]Thank you, Marvash Magali, for the $1.
[116:19.55]Hey, Jerma, today I'm challenging chat to beat my high score in audio surf.
[116:24.00]I used a classic song.
[116:25.06]I hope you appreciate it.
[116:26.10]Beat your high song in audio surf.
[116:34.77]Can you beat it?
[116:36.45]Can you beat it in audio surf?
[116:40.11]What's the high score?
[116:42.77]I want to see the high score.
[116:45.06]I skipped.
[116:45.54]I got it.
[116:46.36]I skipped.
[116:47.56]I skipped it.
[116:48.90]I felt it.
[116:49.58]I could feel it.
[116:54.84]I don't know why.
[116:56.09]I could smell it from a mile away.
[117:02.81]Yep.
[117:04.83]Good thing I jumped a little.
[117:08.19]But thank you, Marv Ashmagali.
[117:09.21]Hope somebody beats your high score.
[117:10.49]Hope somebody beats your high score.
[117:15.13]Eco Leach, thanks for the $1.
[117:16.47]Jerma, I just want to know that while watching your old streams, my computer crashed.
[117:19.62]In short, I demand you pay for my new computer.
[117:22.28]And I'll be seeing you in court if you don't comply.
[117:24.40]Well, I don't own that website that you were on.
[117:25.88]That's twitch.tv.
[117:27.52]That's owned by Amazon.
[117:28.78]So I don't, I have no... Sorry.
[117:35.23]I'm just a...
[117:36.99]Guy that is here.
[117:37.91]That's it.
[117:39.96]Thank you, though.
[117:41.18]Thank you to Foot Powder Spray for the $1.
[117:44.26]Damn, I just got here, but I'll be watching the VOD, and I'm sure I'll be laughing my ass off for a while.
[117:47.88]Best of luck with the move.
[117:49.02]It sounds like people are making it a bit of a shit show.
[117:52.75]No, it's just dealing with realtors from across the country is the problem.
[117:56.79]And I just have to be there.
[118:01.19]And I'm going to be there for like a fucking week.
[118:03.01]So I got all the time necessary to take care of it.
[118:06.04]So don't worry.
[118:07.44]I'll be just fine.
[118:08.36]Thank you for your concern, though, obviously.
[118:10.44]It means a lot.
[118:12.76]Thank you, DiscountVR, for the $1.
[118:14.30]And you have a YouTube link here.
[118:17.12]I'm going to...
[118:21.45]Here is a video called Thank You Jerma, Thank You Star.
[118:29.35]Okay, it looks like a little... Here's a link to it.
[118:33.78]It looks like a little Jerma and Star video.
[118:38.04]Unfortunately, I cannot watch this on stream.
[118:39.70]It's about 10 minutes, and I've got to go.
[118:41.66]I have to leave in less than five minutes.
[118:46.02]So unfortunately, I cannot watch this on stream right now.
[118:50.22]But thank you for making this.
[118:53.56]I will absolutely watch this in the waiting room of the veterinarian clinic.
[119:01.63]So thank you so much for that.
[119:04.55]I will definitely watch it in the waiting room.
[119:07.07]That was the best video.
[119:10.71]I will watch it.
[119:11.23]Don't you worry.
[119:14.48]I will absolutely watch that in like less than 15 minutes.
[119:19.14]Hydrate.
[119:19.60]I'll hydrate at the vet.
[119:20.66]I'll just drink out of the toilet.
[119:23.40]Thank you to... Thank you, Discount, though.
[119:25.30]Thank you, Discount VR, for that YouTube link.
[119:27.56]Thank you, Future Gamer, for the $10.
[119:30.21]Thank you for playing that Zoom In and Zoom In Enhanced game I recommended on the Discord.
[119:34.23]You've given me so much laughter over the years.
[119:35.67]Can't wait for whatever crazy thing you come up with next.
[119:38.41]It was a good recommendation.
[119:40.19]Thank you for recommending it.
[119:42.57]Thank you for the $10, too, man.
[119:45.69]Thank you.
[119:47.19]And we'll stay tuned.
[119:49.09]We'll see how that goes.
[119:50.96]Thank you to Max G. Shep for the two bucks.
[119:53.26]Love the streams and watching The Sims stream was the hardest I've laughed in a good while.
[119:57.72]Good luck with the move.
[119:59.96]Thank you.
[120:02.16]Hope it goes smoothly too.
[120:03.62]Hey, Eves, thanks for the $1, Eves.
[120:05.50]For as long as I have been here, how do you carry out a successful Jupiter?
[120:09.31]I've never been able to do it.
[120:11.51]Somebody's gonna do it right now.
[120:14.47]You have to learn from the best because it's about to happen.
[120:21.79]That one was even fucking weird.
[120:23.59]That one was a fucked up weird one.
[120:27.45]You've got to learn from the best.
[120:29.66]But thank you, Eves.
[120:30.26]Thank you, Vertical, for the $1.
[120:31.40]By the way, after watching the Mutant House Friends intro, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Chuck Schnoswell is probably my favorite character you've ever created since I started watching your streams more often.
[120:41.84]he's pretty great uh your stream your sim streams are some of the funniest I've seen in a hot second and catch me at pax west cosplaying as the schnozwell Jerma schnoz but it would just be like a pinocchio nose right uh he's my I love schnozwell something about him I love his shirt it's you know it's the shirt makes it that weird uh that weird like cashmere sweater makes the whole character without it I don't know I don't know if I would uh relate to him as much as I do
[121:11.47]And that's not because, like, cashmere's expensive.
[121:13.39]That's not why I'm relating to him.
[121:14.51]I'm just saying, like, just as a character.
[121:15.89]You know what I mean?
[121:20.59]And I miss FruFru.
[121:21.53]He's fine!
[121:23.31]But thank you to Vertical.
[121:24.15]Thank you, Johnny and Nathaniel Jones for the $1.
[121:26.07]Hello, member me.
[121:27.05]I eat hot dogs.
[121:29.16]Anyways, I just got my first donation and reached 50 followers last night.
[121:32.88]I'm so close to affiliate!
[121:35.50]One day, I hope to keep people entertained by streaming six hours of me meticulously folding cardboard.
[121:42.42]I mean, it takes a lot.
[121:44.98]I mean, I am.
[121:45.64]You know, I'm the guy you want to talk to.
[121:48.51]I'm the guy that you want to follow here.
[121:50.15]I am the number one Nintendo Labo streamer on Twitch.
[121:52.47]That's apt to go look it up.
[121:54.09]I am the number one most watched, most viewed, and most followed, most subscribed Nintendo Labo stream.
[122:02.56]I got the data to back it up.
[122:05.78]That is a fact.
[122:12.77]Look at those PogChamps coming in.
[122:18.73]That's not saying much.
[122:23.17]But it is saying, isn't it?
[122:25.84]Not saying much, but it's still saying.
[122:28.46]I'm gonna put that on my fucking business card.
[122:30.62]Flash that to people.
[122:31.66]Like, oh yeah, hey man.
[122:33.08]Yeah, I'm a Jerma985.
[122:34.40]You might know me from Twitch.
[122:36.36]And they just take a look at it and they're just like, like fucking fan, just blowing their faces.
[122:42.13]Like, you know, like the thing where their mouth goes like, and the hair flies back.
[122:46.50]This is bad representation.
[122:47.86]But like, they're gonna look at it and just fucking boom, like a Beyonce video.
[122:54.92]I have a little fan here.
[122:55.68]I was trying to demonstrate, but it's not powerful enough.
[122:58.68]But thank you, Johnny Nathaniel.
[123:00.06]Good luck on affiliate.
[123:02.08]Did you just get affiliate?
[123:02.96]No, you're so close.
[123:03.54]Good luck.
[123:05.02]Thank you, DinosaursRex for the $1.
[123:06.36]Jerma, don't read this out loud.
[123:08.38]Okay.
[123:10.80]I won't.
[123:12.02]Okay.
[123:15.04]Got it.
[123:17.48]Okay.
[123:18.44]Thank you, DivUSP for the $3 here.
[123:20.58]Hey, Jerma Hart.
[123:21.24]Hey.
[123:22.60]Hey, everybody.
[123:25.30]What is this?
[123:25.56]I don't know why this is here.
[123:29.09]Oh yeah, because I was like doing work.
[123:30.53]Look at all, I'm doing work.
[123:32.27]Don't you understand?
[123:33.65]You guys don't understand.
[123:34.27]Look at how clean this room is now.
[123:35.53]I've been like screwing things in and unscrewing.
[123:39.20]Look at how much work I've done.
[123:45.92]Okay, I gotta go.
[123:46.46]You're right.
[123:47.36]Uh, thank you, Dinosaurus Rex.
[123:48.38]Thank you, DivUSP for the three bucks.
[123:49.76]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer for the one dollar.
[123:51.20]It's actually, uh, facecam bits.
[123:53.70]It feels a rather rare occurrence to Garfield.
[123:55.33]I gotta go.
[123:56.75]Uh, like, dang, facial reaction to Garf's bits.
[123:58.45]Are you ready to puke up a hairball in disgust?
[124:00.81]Uh, anyways, I hope you, hope you move to Dubai.
[124:03.61]What?
[124:05.01]You should try some food from my new restaurant.
[124:07.63]Alright, here's the, what, what do you, what is this?
[124:13.15]Hey, this Garfield's like menu from Garfield's restaurant.
[124:17.20]Thank you, Garfield, for the $2 here, Garfield.
[124:19.44]Let's just be honest here.
[124:20.20]I can't believe they named an item on their menu a Garfashini.
[124:24.64]That's something I do in my bit messages.
[124:26.58]I replace the first syllable with all of my words with Garf, and now Jim Davis is taking inspiration from my stupid bits.
[124:35.01]Boogers came out, and I hope you didn't see it.
[124:36.73]The camera's not on high enough.
[124:38.92]Thank you, Mandra... Mandragoroot.
[124:43.82]Mandragoroot.
[124:45.65]For one dollar, they say fuck...
[124:48.84]I'm sorry you're saying that, and then your explodations.
[124:52.72]Thank you for the fuck there.
[124:54.16]Thank you for the $1.
[124:55.26]Thank you for the $1.
[124:57.04]Thank you, Gabe Cool, for the $1.
[124:58.50]Jerma, who are your favorite musical artists?
[125:00.00]Also, when is my door cube arriving?
[125:02.85]Your door cube is never arriving, because they were recalled.
[125:07.65]Thank you for your musical artists.
[125:09.51]I'm just, my brain is mixing it all together.
[125:12.77]The Gorillaz are my favorite musical act.
[125:15.00]Why am I calling it a musical act?
[125:16.36]It's their band.
[125:17.50]Griddle isn't my favorite band.
[125:19.86]Thank you, though, Gabe Cole, for the $1.
[125:21.28]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[125:22.42]Okay, we're going to try this again because you don't understand how quote marks are used for emphasis.
[125:27.10]Jerma is wrong.
[125:29.03]Streams are my favorite type of streams.
[125:33.99]They weren't quotes in that last bit message.
[125:37.05]Get the data.
[125:38.23]I got the data.
[125:40.97]Thank you, Night Team, for the $1 times 10.
[125:44.17]Thank you for the 10 bucks, Night Team.
[125:45.65]This community is best community.
[125:47.85]I agree.
[125:49.53]Thank you, Night Team, for the 10 bucks.
[125:52.95]I think this is the best Nintendo Labo top-rated stream on Twitch.
[125:56.87]This is the best Nintendo Labo-focused community.
[126:01.18]I think so.
[126:03.10]Thank you also to Dr. Plato.
[126:06.24]Uh, thank you DivUSP for the one dollar.
[126:08.28]I gotta go, I do.
[126:09.54]Thank you Cheesecake319 for the one dollar.
[126:12.04]I'm turning to you for life advice.
[126:13.85]Should I come out to my, should I come out to my parents as trans?
[126:17.95]Thanks.
[126:20.43]Well, uh, I think that you should honestly, I don't know, I think it's tough.
[126:30.72]That's a tough question for me because
[126:34.65]I think the correct answer is yes, right?
[126:38.15]I think so.
[126:40.17]But there's a lot of history there that maybe you and your family have.
[126:44.81]I think you should.
[126:46.15]But I don't know what your family dynamic is like, right?
[126:55.94]Somebody said your safety comes first.
[126:57.36]That's true.
[126:58.48]But also you should be the person that you want to be.
[127:00.42]You should be the best person that you know that you can.
[127:03.14]That's my opinion on it.
[127:03.90]That's what I got to say.
[127:04.86]And I think the answer should be yes, but I don't know your family at all.
[127:09.06]So it's hard to answer that question.
[127:11.08]And my mother is calling me.
[127:20.41]I just buttoned to my mother.
[127:23.19]No, that has nothing to do with Otto.
[127:24.95]We're good.
[127:28.52]That has nothing to do with Otto.
[127:31.96]I got fine.
[127:33.16]I'm fine.
[127:34.26]We're done.
[127:34.98]Look, we're done.
[127:36.76]But I wish you the best of luck, Cheesecake.
[127:40.51]Hopefully you, you know, come to a decision that you're comfortable with.
[127:45.15]But thank you for the $1.
[127:47.43]Wish you the best of luck.
[127:49.47]Gabe Cool, thanks for the $1.
[127:50.85]When is my Dork Cube arriving?
[127:52.01]Ordered it two years ago.
[127:53.03]It was a scam.
[127:53.97]I scammed you.
[127:55.61]Thank you, Gabe Cool.
[127:58.17]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer for the $1.
[127:59.68]Yo, Jerma.
[128:02.40]We got to get to the vet.
[128:03.44]I packed all my stuff.
[128:04.91]Good.
[128:06.91]Good.
[128:07.85]That means you can come too, Garfield.
[128:09.13]Maybe we'll like, maybe we'll like remove your vocal cords.
[128:15.71]I don't mean that.
[128:16.39]I'm kidding.
[128:18.26]Thank you, Captain Morgan, for the $1.
[128:21.16]The next WrestleMania is set to be really crazy.
[128:23.16]They bring in a half wrestler, half yodeler named Vinny Gardosh.
[128:28.04]And he made me think of you.
[128:29.10]Do you like yodeling?
[128:30.97]It's a very talented skill.
[128:33.77]That's a talented, talented thing to do.
[128:35.75]And I would love to see that.
[128:38.52]Gabe, cool.
[128:39.00]Thanks for the $1.
[128:40.25]Where's my damn dork cube?
[128:43.42]I told you.
[128:44.91]You couldn't even order them.
[128:45.73]I was going to actually make a doorcube.com, but I didn't because I was afraid that people might actually try to buy it or pay for things.
[128:51.85]And I was like, nah, that's a bad idea.
[128:53.33]But anyways, thank you, Gabe Cool.
[128:54.45]Thank you, Dinosaurus Rex for the $1.
[128:55.47]No, we aren't.
[128:56.23]Remember, please.
[128:57.59]And then Sticky Brick with $1 says, just go, which I am.
[129:00.71]See you later.
[129:01.81]That doesn't mean the stream turns off, though, guys.
[129:04.12]It's going to be on for like four hours.
[129:11.38]Thank you, Clue the Sniper for the $1.
[129:12.30]Bye.
[129:16.29]Good luck on the move, thanks.
[129:19.64]Can I like turn this off like with my hands ready?
[129:21.54]Tell me if it worked.
[129:23.64]And I'll see you next time.
