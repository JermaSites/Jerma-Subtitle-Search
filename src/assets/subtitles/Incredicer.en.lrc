[00:08.10]How's it going?
[00:10.81]Hey, Fred.
[00:11.20]Hey, Fred.
[00:15.78]Alright, we're gonna do this next game.
[00:20.80]This next game is gonna be...
[00:22.18]I'm gonna play this for like an hour.
[00:23.83]Maybe like 30 minutes to an hour.
[00:27.77]And I know everybody in the back rooms are making bets on if I'm going to play Wuthering Rooms or not today.
[00:36.28]Sorry to say, you're gonna lose your bet.
[00:41.16]I'm playing it in like 30 minutes.
[00:45.18]Okay.
[00:46.07]This next game is called... What the hell is this called?
[00:53.24]Incredicer.
[00:57.10]It's a dice incremental game, and I'm going to play it, and I'm going to get addicted to it for like six hours.
[01:03.40]Maybe you should continue to make bets.
[01:10.93]Let's turn it up a little.
[01:22.53]Alright, so you have a dice.
[01:25.72]And you roll the dice.
[01:29.15]And I got an achievement.
[01:30.71]The trickling already happened.
[01:36.96]There's a skill tree.
[01:38.01]Dude, let's go.
[01:40.46]Okay, whatever you land on, you get that for money.
[01:44.82]So I just got to keep doing this.
[01:48.76]Alright, okay, just dice.
[01:51.89]I got two dice now?
[01:53.18]Two die?
[01:56.32]This is my kind of game, man.
[01:58.42]This is my kind of game.
[02:01.39]It just is.
[02:05.14]It feels good to play too.
[02:11.98]Alright, how many more?
[02:12.70]Unlock Dark Matter at a thousand dollars.
[02:17.92]Plus one to dice income.
[02:28.35]I gotta get somebody to auto do this for me withering rooms is shattered it is not it is not
[02:37.46]Yeah, let's go.
[02:47.95]Dude, you see how many sixes I just got?
[02:53.08]You don't have to click these either.
[02:54.00]You just have to, you have to just touch them and they fly up.
[02:59.09]There's gotta be a good route I can take, right?
[03:00.72]Like starting top left.
[03:03.15]Top left wrap around like this.
[03:10.36]Okay, more.
[03:14.42]Your hands are gonna get sore?
[03:15.53]Not when I start automating it, once I get the automation.
[03:24.00]That's a good route.
[03:30.16]That was suboptimal.
[03:36.82]Ah, suboptimal.
[03:40.84]Alright, upgrade.
[03:42.57]Plus one to dice income.
[03:45.32]So now they're all worth one more each?
[03:48.17]Oh yeah.
[03:58.22]You can play Path of Exile.
[04:00.01]Um... Maybe.
[04:01.60]I...
[04:02.38]Okay.
[04:03.13]My computer was getting fucking destroyed.
[04:07.42]from the new update.
[04:09.07]The druid seems so cool.
[04:11.46]I kept getting the um... like the cogwheels of death.
[04:15.53]Like shader resets.
[04:18.67]It was kind of laggy and crazy and I don't know how to do it.
[04:25.68]We all get that?
[04:33.91]Yeah, it was happening pretty frequently though.
[04:35.50]It was kind of messing up whole things I was trying to do.
[04:39.57]Seemed like every five minutes my ping would just skyrocket and it would kind of mess up my game.
[04:44.58]And then I would, my whole game would freeze for 10 to 20 seconds.
[04:49.26]And then the game would just reset all the shaders, I think.
[04:53.54]I did not have that happen the last time I played.
[04:57.85]So, I'm just gonna wait and see if I need to do anything like roll back drivers or something.
[05:02.07]I have NVIDIA.
[05:05.47]Okay, dark matter.
[05:08.69]The hell does that do?
[05:12.27]um wait I'm not getting money anymore I'm getting dark matter for no I am I'm getting both
[05:23.51]It's an NVIDIA driver issue.
[05:41.02]Game doesn't play well with DirectX.
[05:43.78]I switched to Vulkan, but when I switched to Vulkan, I had to redo all the shaders again, and I just kind of rolled my eyes and I said, I don't, um, I got other things I want to do today.
[06:06.15]Okay, wait, the skill tree.
[06:09.31]This is where you use dark matter?
[06:10.51]Okay, so I got, whoa, how big is this?
[06:14.08]This looks kind of, this looks insane.
[06:16.73]Look at how big that is.
[06:18.50]Overall income multiplier.
[06:21.22]Let's get this up to five.
[06:25.49]I gotta get this up too.
[06:26.86]We need more income.
[06:42.31]Multiply income for sure.
[06:44.93]Let me just get, I gotta get all five of those.
[06:50.63]And then we'll do multiply.
[06:55.29]You need more dark generation matter?
[06:58.39]Dark matter generation, yeah.
[07:00.44]Let me get, hold on, let me lock this in and get a route.
[07:13.33]Kind of feels like popcorn.
[07:19.95]Alright, what do we got?
[07:21.41]Uh, let's do multiplier.
[07:23.64]Jesus.
[07:28.02]Plus one and rolling a two?
[07:34.09]100% income?
[07:35.13]5% chance?
[07:38.40]What about this way?
[07:40.15]Dice roll speed?
[07:41.29]Oh, give me that.
[07:42.04]I'm getting that.
[07:42.94]That's the next priority right there.
[07:57.93]I want to try and sleep, but I feel like this game is going to randomly get loud.
[08:04.02]I don't...
[08:05.45]I don't... Maybe besides the Steam achievements, maybe?
[08:07.90]I don't know.
[08:12.34]Gambling game for cats.
[08:16.46]cats cats you say hmm
[08:27.28]Interesting.
[08:30.19]Interesting.
[08:39.43]Why did I do that?
[08:40.09]I was gonna buy this.
[08:40.90]Alright, I want more speed.
[08:48.73]Bronze dice.
[08:51.34]I'm gonna do that.
[08:51.90]We're gonna build up for that.
[08:53.15]I'm gonna get that and it's gonna be crazy.
[08:54.67]It's gonna go so hard.
[08:55.58]Watch this.
[09:02.66]You suck at this game?
[09:03.81]You cannot be bad at this game.
[09:07.63]That's like saying, dude, you suck at, uh, time.
[09:12.42]Dude, you are so bad at time going by on the universe.
[09:17.92]You are so bad at four hours going by.
[09:32.75]Oh, he's faded tonight.
[09:36.03]I'm not faded.
[09:41.85]They talk about smoking weed on stream before, and that means I'm smoking weed every single stream.
[09:48.29]No, I told you, I gave that up completely when I couldn't read a fucking clock in Saw 2.
[09:55.53]I've never done that ever again.
[09:58.91]then I just couldn't, it can't happen again.
[10:07.77]You can Kappa all you want.
[10:09.28]I know the truth.
[10:10.63]I have the truth up here.
[10:13.99]Go ahead and Kappa, Kappa, that's fine.
[10:16.64]That was such an embarrassment for me.
[10:18.29]I have not done it on stream since.
[10:21.62]It's been like three and a half years.
[10:38.94]What did the clock look like?
[10:40.20]I knew it was a clock!
[10:43.19]I knew what I needed to do, it's just I couldn't...
[10:46.55]There was like a hard drive sector error.
[10:50.53]There's just an error.
[10:55.19]Every time I got to that point of the hard drive, it was just like, no.
[10:58.19]No.
[10:58.75]Nope.
[11:00.66]Nope.
[11:00.78]Nope.
[11:13.12]more dice?
[11:16.52]Alright, do I go right for the two times income or do I just try to build up?
[11:22.90]Oh, fuck yeah, more matter.
[11:32.21]Okay, the more that I play this, the more I see withering rooms start to go into the distance a little.
[11:38.80]But I'm going to play it today, I promise.
[11:41.09]That is a 100% guarantee.
[11:54.28]And then tomorrow.
[11:56.70]Tomorrow, Ster and I are going to play Where Winds Meet.
[12:00.05]It's a sponsor.
[12:01.64]We're playing it for a couple of hours.
[12:04.21]And then we'll do something else.
[12:16.20]I might start early tomorrow too and do something before.
[12:22.05]And then after tomorrow...
[12:25.15]We are going to go back to the SEGA CD.
[12:28.44]I got some crazy ones that are lined up.
[12:31.07]SEGA CD is coming back.
[12:34.41]We're going to have another SEGA CD evening, probably that weekend.
[12:38.43]So tomorrow's Monday, right?
[12:41.70]So maybe like Thursday or Friday we'll do like a big SEGA CD weekend.
[12:46.84]Get through a bunch of them.
[12:49.43]Should be fun.
[12:54.43]Alright, they're making a ton of money now.
[13:00.32]I'll also show Otto this weekend as well.
[13:03.31]You guys can say hello.
[13:14.71]That felt good to do.
[13:19.21]I'm going to beat this game in 30 minutes.
[13:38.77]gambling for cats I just see a cat just looking at every dice that's going up and down
[13:46.97]Just look that way.
[13:47.94]Left, right, left, right, left, left, left, left, left, right, left, right.
[13:53.27]Okay, I'm almost at max dice.
[14:01.13]Hold on.
[14:02.25]Let's optimize.
[14:13.69]Alright.
[14:14.75]Optimization complete.
[14:21.80]Boom.
[14:24.00]Two times income now.
[14:26.39]Bronze dice.
[14:27.97]Check it out.
[14:29.62]Bronze income.
[14:30.52]Where are the bronze dice?
[14:32.77]Oh, fuck.
[14:34.65]How much are these worth?
[14:43.81]How do you win?
[14:44.47]I don't know.
[14:48.72]Maybe you don't.
[14:49.70]We'll find out.
[15:01.24]Alright, need a route to hit all the bronze.
[15:05.64]And any whites that we get in the way?
[15:10.74]That's just extra cash.
[15:19.95]That's clean.
[15:25.41]Oh dude, that's clean.
[15:34.33]No, I need more.
[15:35.88]Where's the multiplier?
[15:37.86]There we go.
[15:38.99]Alright, 50% overall income multiplier is done.
[15:45.15]We're going to make hundreds.
[15:56.69]Are you sure this is more efficient than just going crazy with the mouse?
[16:06.06]How much money per second is that?
[16:14.78]Oh wow, that's way better.
[16:20.54]VIP that person internally in your mind for five seconds and then take it away.
[16:36.60]Is it better though?
[16:48.43]But this hurts though.
[16:49.60]I can't do this for more than 10 seconds.
[16:55.97]We gotta get the automation.
[16:56.89]Automation's definitely coming.
[17:02.20]You need a radius increaser?
[17:17.42]What about just like a sweep like this?
[17:22.57]Yeah, I think just like a scrub.
[17:24.26]I think a scrub is better than a crazy.
[17:40.15]What about Circles maybe?
[17:43.52]I think Circles is the play.
[17:46.09]VIP that guy.
[17:47.34]Me.
[17:48.81]Yep, it's definitely circles.
[17:49.98]It's small circles.
[17:56.98]go crazy with the mouse.
[17:59.41]I just see some of you guys playing this and just like freaking the fuck out.
[18:09.43]Alright, 15k.
[18:19.79]Plus one to income.
[18:21.22]What else what's down here?
[18:21.96]Oh, that's what that person said.
[18:24.31]Cursor area upgrade.
[18:31.30]Help her hand.
[18:37.20]Yes.
[18:38.44]All of you just decided that you were going to stick around now.
[18:43.67]What an inefficient piece of shit.
[18:46.90]Are you kidding me?
[18:47.55]You're terrible.
[18:48.69]I mean, I don't even...
[18:50.76]I would rather not have them.
[19:00.58]Watch the income just blow up here.
[19:09.37]Already at 5k?
[19:22.18]Okay, let's do even more.
[19:24.09]Bigger.
[19:24.63]Yep.
[19:28.17]That gets to plus 10.
[19:32.42]I still think it's circles.
[19:37.74]Because crazy doesn't register that much.
[19:40.19]You're almost going too fast.
[19:47.05]Recover speed?
[19:49.14]Oh, the hand.
[19:49.96]Movement speed for the hands.
[19:53.73]What is this one?
[19:54.67]Idle mode.
[19:55.62]Oh.
[19:58.38]through that one.
[20:15.28]Your automation sucks.
[20:16.71]We're in the early innings.
[20:18.00]Just wait.
[20:24.89]Yeah, you want your DPI to be too high, because then it won't even register you touching them.
[20:38.98]Slow big circles moving around.
[20:40.80]Okay.
[20:47.40]Idle mode.
[20:54.18]What is idle mode?
[20:59.72]Now I don't have to do anything!
[21:02.64]hey what's up okay so now this is where I could literally just sit here it's a DVD screen yeah
[21:15.07]it's choked this is bad this is why no you can't be idle can I also play when it's idle no
[21:27.90]yeah just put this in the background of withering rooms that might I'll go crazy
[21:40.86]Alright, when do we get to the point where it starts lagging my computer?
[21:44.54]I feel like we're getting close.
[21:58.78]Okay, how about... Um...
[22:14.08]Let's max out sixes.
[22:17.54]And then... Because I feel like sixes will give us a lot.
[22:24.78]Would you ever turn on your stream at 80 for a bit?
[22:27.14]No.
[22:35.31]My plan is to disappear forever and then randomly show up to like a Comic-Con panel in 15 years.
[22:45.73]You know what I mean?
[22:48.44]They're like, oh, and here, look, it's Jerma.
[22:51.18]And I come out.
[22:52.84]I'll talk about, like, how to grow your channel.
[22:58.67]and I'll just give you a bunch of outdated shit advice.
[23:21.58]Do a Terraria giveaway?
[23:23.23]Okay, I have a question.
[23:29.18]Let's get a poll.
[23:30.84]I'm actually curious about this.
[23:34.46]Do you have Terraria?
[23:38.47]Do you own Terraria?
[23:40.48]It's just, I don't care what platform.
[23:43.22]Do you own Terraria?
[23:45.50]Because I think it's probably like 98% that every single person that operates in any of these spaces has Terraria.
[23:57.66]I'd be shocked if this is less than 90%.
[24:03.97]That's surprisingly low.
[24:10.12]Doesn't Terraria go on sale for like $3 every six months?
[24:16.36]I feel like it's almost hard to not own it at this point.
[24:24.21]I just don't want to play it.
[24:25.72]We're at 70%.
[24:27.09]I thought it was gonna be way higher than that.
[24:37.51]I want more hands.
[24:45.69]It's kind of lame.
[24:46.67]Sorry, that's just me.
[24:54.89]72%.
[24:55.39]Okay.
[24:57.47]I feel like there's a lot of... And don't take this the wrong way, all of you young people.
[25:02.79]Don't take what I'm about to say the wrong way.
[25:04.88]I think there's a lot of newer gamers over the last five-ish years to ten years.
[25:11.99]I'd say like about seven years.
[25:13.33]There's a lot of... A ton of new people came in.
[25:16.52]To... Like gaming and Twitch and... YouTube gaming and...
[25:21.99]I feel like if you asked that question seven or eight years ago, I think it would have been probably 90%.
[25:34.15]I think Terraria might just be a little too old now.
[25:37.38]For all the new age gamers.
[25:39.84]What do you think?
[25:46.98]Terraria's 14 years old, yeah?
[25:51.14]Okay, if you're...
[25:51.72]Okay, if you are... Let's say you were like a 16-year-old right now.
[25:57.86]Terraria is not like, oh man, Terraria!
[26:00.38]That's not like in the front of your brain.
[26:10.67]I think you kind of need to go like seek it out now, don't you?
[26:13.51]Because like, wait, this game, I like this genre.
[26:15.28]I like this.
[26:15.68]I heard people say this was a good one or you see somebody else play it.
[26:24.49]Do Minecraft for a comparison?
[26:27.41]Uh, no, okay, that's...
[26:28.60]I feel like that's...
[26:32.05]that that is the game that everybody yeah do you have Minecraft on any platform it's like asking do you have windows
[26:50.83]Silver dice?
[26:59.90]Alright, I want that multiplier all the way up.
[27:07.22]Alright, the income is going to explode here.
[27:12.38]Do you own Minecraft?
[27:14.36]Let's see.
[27:14.94]84%.
[27:15.97]That's even more surprising than the Terraria one.
[27:21.63]What's the margin for error on something like that?
[27:33.87]It's got to be big, right?
[27:41.83]How's that more surprising?
[27:44.01]Because I think 85% to me,
[27:47.74]I feel like Minecraft almost like comes installed on new Windows computers, doesn't it?
[27:54.18]Isn't Minecraft like the way Skype used to be?
[27:56.74]Isn't it just like, oh, Minecraft, there it is.
[28:01.79]It's like saying you don't have the Windows pinball.
[28:03.61]Isn't it just pre-loaded on Windows now?
[28:07.48]No, it's a game.
[28:08.06]You have to buy it, dude.
[28:09.79]I know, but isn't it like pre-loaded and like Clippy comes out and he's like, hey, by the way, Minecraft on the Windows Store.
[28:15.65]It's not, doesn't that happen?
[28:21.64]Get your account today.
[28:30.79]Look at all this dark matter.
[28:34.23]Okay.
[28:36.06]Where do I want to go now?
[28:39.41]Okay, this is idle mode.
[28:41.25]Enhancements.
[28:44.68]What is this?
[28:46.29]Plus one second duration works more without getting tired.
[28:51.14]Okay, I don't really care about this right now because I'm currently here.
[28:59.84]10 overall income?
[29:00.99]Holy shit.
[29:07.00]I want this circle to be massive.
[29:18.31]Would you ever do a cameo for a show or a movie?
[29:20.97]No.
[29:40.21]You already did.
[29:40.90]What do you mean?
[29:53.51]Would you do an NPR interview?
[29:55.69]I already did an NPR interview.
[30:00.70]That sounded like I was ma- That sounded like a flex?
[30:03.75]That wasn't, I was just- That sounded like I was talking down to you.
[30:09.88]But I promise you it wasn't.
[30:21.22]Max out the dice.
[30:22.33]Hold on.
[30:22.84]I got income.
[30:29.91]It puts your pencil down, your fan art of Nightingale from Withering Rooms crying because I'm not playing it, and you're going to put...
[30:38.58]You can stop doing that.
[30:40.88]Don't post that because it's not going to be necessary.
[30:46.97]It's gonna be so irrelevant.
[30:48.78]It's gonna age like milk.
[31:05.29]Look at how big that is.
[31:17.43]What about Withering Realms?
[31:20.42]That's my most anticipated game.
[31:22.09]I got my most anticipated list.
[31:26.26]It's Resident Evil 9.
[31:28.34]Withering Realms.
[31:34.08]And...
[31:39.92]I don't know, bro.
[31:40.74]What's with the fucking questions, by the way?
[31:42.61]What's with the questioning?
[31:44.64]What is this, 20 questions?
[31:46.27]Why are you even asking me that?
[31:57.49]Like, really.
[32:14.92]In the middle of that is just, what's your favorite ice cream flavor?
[32:17.90]I already did that tier list.
[32:34.44]Look at that plus 50 to overall income.
[32:37.59]Check this out.
[32:51.17]When are you going to do another tier list stream?
[32:53.38]I have coming soon.
[32:55.71]I don't know when.
[32:57.66]The original thought was maybe I would do this for New Year's, but...
[33:00.50]I kinda need to...
[33:01.97]There's a lot of things that have to go into it, so...
[33:07.97]But in the next like month or so, maybe, I'm going to do the gigantic top 250.
[33:15.18]It's going to take probably two or three days.
[33:17.95]So I'm actually really excited about that.
[33:20.65]And then I think Ster is gonna do it too.
[33:24.44]I think he probably will stream it.
[33:25.85]Maybe he will.
[33:27.32]I'm actually very excited to see what Ster's list is.
[33:35.83]Yeah, and then I have to play the top 20.
[33:39.89]That's part of it.
[33:41.99]As long as it's not a multiplayer-only experience, I will play it on stream.
[33:46.60]That is the ultimate goal of this list.
[33:54.94]I know for a fact I've played at least one of them already.
[33:57.15]I did Chrono Trigger earlier this year.
[33:59.66]So that one is grayed out.
[34:09.79]Yeah, it's top 250 games.
[34:12.37]well, not even best, but just most important, most impactful, most, like just things, just like your top 250,
[34:21.19]kind of most important impactful good game list doesn't number one
[34:29.83]I mean, we all know what number one and everybody knows everybody's one through ten, like I said before.
[34:36.08]But it's not necessarily like, what is the best video game of all time?
[34:40.14]It's like, what is the most important video game to you of all time?
[34:43.96]And it's gonna be a ranking.
[34:45.63]There's gonna be multiple rounds.
[34:48.47]Should be kind of interesting.
[34:58.12]Alright, where are we going from here?
[34:59.69]Dice roll speed, dark matter gain... Yep.
[35:04.01]Alright, holy shit.
[35:07.23]Unlocks chance to shoot projectile on roll complete.
[35:19.60]Yeah, I gotta get some of these unlocked.
[35:37.62]This stream always ends up in an incremental or gambling game.
[35:41.40]Hey.
[35:44.02]Just know what you're good at and do it.
[35:50.58]Know what you like and do it.
[36:03.07]Play Portal?
[36:03.81]Uh, Portal makes me want to puke.
[36:06.56]I painfully went through Portal 1 and Portal 2.
[36:10.23]Because I loved the games, but they made me sick.
[36:15.07]I've told that story a thousand times about trying to get through Half-Life 2 before I knew what an FOV slider was when I was like 17.
[36:21.75]and needing to lay down on my back for five to ten minutes every hour of gameplay.
[36:27.75]I would actually feel like I was going to puke, so I would lay down.
[36:29.39]I wanted to beat the game.
[36:30.51]It was fun.
[36:30.81]It was great.
[36:32.84]But every hour I had to lay down on the ground on my back.
[36:37.22]Or I would throw up at the computer.
[36:40.09]And that's before FOV sliders.
[36:42.69]It was kind of common knowledge.
[36:44.86]I just thought the game made me want to throw up and I couldn't figure out why.
[36:48.67]We didn't know anything back then, guys.
[36:50.08]We didn't know shit.
[36:56.17]All these graphic settings, all these things, it was so foreign.
[37:00.81]It wasn't really, nobody really thought about that like 30 years ago.
[37:07.63]In fact, I don't think it was even possible to even change it in 90% of every release that ever came out.
[37:14.30]If a game was just weird looking, it just was.
[37:26.68]I remember Team Fortress 2, I remember seeing Field of View and it was 75 and I was like, what does this do?
[37:33.75]And I dragged the bar.
[37:36.86]And I said, wait a minute, what does that do?
[37:38.57]I can see more of the screen?
[37:42.01]Wait, I can see more of the screen!
[37:44.50]And I don't feel like I'm gonna throw up!
[37:51.95]Alright, we need dark matter.
[37:54.90]Where's dark matter?
[38:05.87]Where was that dark matter?
[38:06.83]I saw it was plus one to dark matter.
[38:12.24]There it is.
[38:18.32]Alright, I'm going to focus on this, get it maxed out.
[38:22.91]We've not come that much further, honestly.
[38:24.30]Some people think FOV is one universal number.
[38:27.05]Same across every game.
[38:28.50]And I'm tired of explaining it.
[38:31.03]What's the old thing is the further away you're sitting from the TV, the better, the lower the FOV can be.
[38:37.36]That's why console games don't care about it because most people play their console games like six to ten feet away from the console game, right?
[38:46.74]So, but for a computer screen, if you're that close, usually you're sitting about maybe three to four feet away from your screen.
[38:55.33]It's worse, especially on a larger monitor as monitors have gotten bigger.
[39:05.84]Guys, we didn't know anything.
[39:08.10]I remember playing on like a 17 inch screen.
[39:14.31]on like a laptop screen.
[39:16.39]It was like a 13 or 14 inch laptop screen.
[39:20.35]This thing got so hot.
[39:21.88]It was huge.
[39:22.70]It weighed so much.
[39:24.81]It was the heaviest fucking thing ever.
[39:26.66]And it, like, burnt my legs when it was on my legs.
[39:29.03]And I didn't even care.
[39:30.13]I was like, oh, that's just what happens.
[39:31.44]Your legs hurt when you play on this laptop when you set it on your lap.
[39:35.81]and then you get it on a desk.
[39:37.28]I used to have to have a cooling pad, guys.
[39:39.77]They, after market,
[39:41.16]It was a thing you put under your laptop to suck air from under the laptop so it didn't fucking burn up and overheat.
[39:50.16]and it still didn't even matter.
[40:04.63]Is this tree going to be that big?
[40:14.19]temperature, the GPU clock speeds.
[40:17.98]I didn't know what the fuck that was.
[40:23.87]I started to understand and once you know what resolution is even doing... That was when I was like 15.
[40:29.00]I was like 14 or 15.
[40:31.03]When Diablo II came out with Lord of Destruction, and you could change the resolution to 800x600,
[40:41.03]That was the first time I really thought, wait... That just means it's more and bigger and you can see more and...
[40:48.52]Okay, can I go higher?
[40:54.55]That was a huge deal when you could do, when LOD was 800 by 600.
[41:08.91]I almost got a million.
[41:12.10]As a kid, you just maxed out everything.
[41:13.73]You don't understand stuff like f- Yeah, you just... Why would I not want to put it on best quality?
[41:19.42]without understanding that the GPU is rendering these frames?
[41:25.90]So put everything at maximum and wonder why you're running the game at like 9 FPS.
[41:30.48]Guys, Command & Red Alert, I actually have trouble playing that game.
[41:34.68]The way it's intended.
[41:36.29]Because when I played it when I was younger, it ran at like 5 FPS, and I learned the game that way.
[41:43.18]The game ran so bad that I actually had to learn how to play it?
[41:48.58]kind of in slow motion.
[41:50.31]And going back to playing it now, it's actually like, this is too fast!
[41:53.79]I don't like this!
[41:54.41]There's too much going on!
[41:57.33]I have to relearn that whole game if I want to play it again.
[42:09.02]Alright, I got money.
[42:10.37]Let's see.
[42:10.81]I still can't do dark matter.
[42:20.39]Alright, I'm saving up for... that.
[42:24.73]Alright, let's spend some money.
[42:29.05]Mmm...
[42:39.29]Oh, this is getting... this is getting good.
[43:04.96]Feels weak, man.
[43:06.25]Withering rooms.
[43:07.16]I'm telling you, you're going to see it.
[43:16.10]All you non-belie... Why don't you do a prediction then?
[43:19.73]Let's put your money where your mouth is.
[43:21.33]Will I play Withering Rooms tonight for at least one hour?
[43:25.47]Put your money where your mouth is.
[43:26.37]Let's see.
[43:49.71]Alright.
[43:50.30]Somebody said there was a dark matter up here.
[43:53.10]Oh, fuck.
[43:53.47]There is.
[44:06.67]Have you been watching Squeaks and Ludwig's Dark Souls-a-thon?
[44:09.38]I've caught some of it.
[44:10.38]It's been pretty funny.
[44:15.90]My favorite is when Ludwig just walks off of a cliff.
[44:30.15]I feel it though.
[44:31.06]I feel that because that's the shit that I've done a million times.
[44:38.11]It feels good to see that that shit happens.
[44:57.70]And I love Squeaks.
[44:58.65]Squeaks is so fucking funny.
[45:00.94]He's a great streamer.
[45:06.00]He's very quick.
[45:27.01]What about, did you see Wubby's 24-hour tag?
[45:28.78]I did.
[45:34.02]That was great.
[45:34.48]This was some good shit on Twitch the last few weeks, honestly.
[45:53.68]Alright, I'm maxed out on everything.
[46:11.68]The times I tuned into what Bobby was doing is...
[46:15.70]They were watching like a Jimmy Neutron documentary?
[46:19.39]Like they were supposed to be like sleeping?
[46:21.98]It was like a Jimmy Neutron documentary.
[46:26.89]I was like, what is going on?
[46:35.43]They got the rights to it for the creator.
[46:37.17]That's so funny.
[46:41.65]So they were shooting like tennis balls at each other with the pitching machine.
[47:04.94]Switch to weathering rooms now.
[47:06.29]You're going to get hungry for dinner.
[47:14.20]I'm alright Alright, I need to buy more shit
[47:45.41]Holly's asking, does Otto need dinner?
[47:53.62]Otto does need dinner.
[48:00.14]Sorry, Otto.
[48:00.89]Dad's up here.
[48:01.93]Dad's up here rolling the dice.
[48:23.14]Alright, this is actually rolling now.
[48:26.64]Okay, let me take a look at some of this other stuff.
[48:31.04]Maybe I should just buy this to keep going?
[48:33.27]No.
[48:36.02]Ooh, gold dice.
[48:42.46]Alright, I'm going for that next.
[48:43.99]25,000 matter.
[48:57.28]This is gonna start to look like Vampire Survivors.
[48:59.62]Not gonna be able to see anything.
[49:11.92]The bitrate is already shit.
[49:15.84]I probably should turn the music off too.
[49:18.05]The music's been like...
[49:22.61]It's been like 30, 40 minutes already, right?
[49:25.33]How long have we been playing this for?
[49:26.28]45 minutes?
[49:34.82]OSTs?
[49:38.00]I know the perfect OST to start with from my favorite game.
[49:57.93]Turn this down a little.
[50:03.65]Alright, we're putting on the Look Outside OST.
[50:08.61]Not just one song.
[50:09.49]Let's listen to it.
[50:13.91]It's a good one.
[50:23.44]You're not even capturing the game sound?
[50:26.72]Yeah, I am.
[50:39.51]Alright, here we go.
[50:53.21]I'll turn it up don't worry.
[51:05.24]Oh I thought that was my hand.
[51:15.20]Yeah.
[51:19.72]Should I even just turn off the sound so people don't think there's like a water running in their house?
[51:32.34]We can't hear it anyways?
[51:33.49]Okay.
[51:39.60]Gold dice.
[51:58.18]I'm beating this today.
[52:38.44]I love this song.
[52:42.25]Thank you.
[52:51.54]$800,000 for that.
[53:02.25]Thank you.
[53:12.17]Overall income to gold?
[53:13.38]Dude, no, we're going for emerald dice.
[53:37.44]Joel described the song as a little black cat wearing a witch hat and little bats flying around.
[53:43.10]Did Joel play this on stream?
[53:46.97]Because that's...
[53:48.26]I got something to watch.
[53:52.43]He did?
[53:52.84]Oh, man.
[53:54.85]I gotta watch that.
[53:58.38]Bye.
[54:14.97]Joel, I knew I liked you dude.
[54:19.29]Bring it in man.
[54:22.93]Thank you.
[54:30.04]Thank you.
[54:42.83]That's way too much money, but it is extra income.
[54:46.60]Boom.
[54:47.62]Emerald dice.
[54:56.98]Two million for one?
[55:19.21]I love the cassettes.
[55:23.37]This game is so good.
[55:24.35]I need to like fucking just play it again.
[55:49.01]I love the battle music in this game.
[55:50.62]It's just so like.
[55:53.93]When you have battle music that just goes like dun dun.
[55:58.68]It just works so well.
[56:03.95]Like a horror kind of game.
[56:04.95]It's great.
[56:05.64]It's so good.
[56:12.62]Just play it again on stream and do another ending?
[56:14.41]I actually might.
[56:15.65]If it's my favorite game of the year, then why not, right?
[56:18.97]Why wouldn't I do that?
[56:21.49]I'm playing... tonight.
[56:23.70]My...
[56:27.72]Wow, the OST goes crazy here.
[56:31.53]Your invitation has arrived.
[56:36.94]I thought that was in the game for a second.
[56:38.39]I was like, holy shit, I don't remember that.
[56:54.82]It's 50%.
[56:59.30]150 income.
[57:02.17]Oh, now it's going to be gassed up.
[57:06.80]Okay, ruby dice.
[57:10.28]That overall- look at this overall income, it's about to go fucking crazy.
[57:19.33]you
[57:32.17]Buy more dice, dude.
[57:33.27]Buy more dice.
[57:35.26]Buy my book.
[57:36.81]Buy my book.
[57:38.35]Buy my book.
[58:08.68]90s pop culture references.
[58:11.15]Yeah, I'm going kind of crazy today, huh?
[58:24.56]What does your screen look like?
[58:25.92]My screen looks pretty crisp.
[58:27.65]I don't think yours does.
[58:44.59]Yeah!
[58:51.35]This is a good one.
[59:01.47]Thank you.
[59:14.97]Please increase your area.
[59:16.27]Ooh, you're right.
[59:21.90]Alright, let me see if I can help your bit rate.
[59:34.11]Does that help?
[59:52.36]Yeah, we know the numbers are high.
[59:53.59]We don't need to see them.
[60:06.93]I do need a bigger area.
[60:15.14]That person was in line.
[60:15.94]Now that I can see.
[60:29.15]Alright, what if I get bigger area?
[60:30.44]Here.
[60:33.07]More hands.
[60:36.62]Okay, let's get that up.
[60:49.37]Sounds like who wants to be a millionaire?
[60:50.77]I gotta get my...
[60:55.79]I gotta log into my fucking YouTube account.
[61:03.44]And this, let me tell you something, like Liberty Mutual, let me just tell you something about Liberty Mutual is trying to go the Geico route, right?
[61:09.95]Where it's like,
[61:10.53]Look, it's a meme.
[61:12.63]Look at the emu.
[61:13.36]It's a meme.
[61:13.90]We're memeing ourselves.
[61:18.28]It feels like they're trying to do the fucking Geico turtle or the lizard thing.
[61:35.50]This is a good one.
[61:40.05]Oh, you don't want to see it?
[61:41.11]I don't have to catch it.
[61:42.76]Like I don't even, who cares?
[62:10.52]What is with insurance companies and having an animal?
[62:13.45]You know what I'm saying?
[62:16.08]Aflac has the duck.
[62:18.33]Liberty Mutual has an emu.
[62:20.85]Geico has the turtle?
[62:22.52]I know it's a fucking lizard.
[62:26.76]What's going on here?
[62:35.02]That's why I trust the General, okay?
[62:37.72]That's why I trust the General.
[62:57.43]You know why I trust the general?
[62:59.16]Because they haven't updated their graphics quality on that character in like 30 years.
[63:12.23]They don't need to...
[63:13.08]I mean, the General did get a little bit of an update, but he's still, like, too...
[63:16.37]They went from, like, 2001 CGI to, like, 2006 CGI.
[63:23.27]To me, that, I feel like I can trust that.
[63:34.49]Make him a, they should make him a VTuber.
[63:38.65]That's how they reach the new audience, man.
[63:40.85]Get the general on, like, Call of Duty.
[63:44.11]And just get him a VTuber model.
[63:46.02]Get him a good VTuber model.
[63:49.86]He can pause to do his own ad breaks.
[64:11.35]Like Chuck E. Cheese?
[64:12.25]No, completely unlike Chuck E. Cheese, because Chuck E. Cheese had an idea, and for some reason,
[64:20.51]Now, I love Chuck, okay?
[64:22.10]I would say Chuck and I are friends.
[64:23.97]You know what I'm saying?
[64:25.94]But...
[64:27.76]when Chuck E. Cheese did it, he just didn't talk.
[64:29.90]He leaned into the mic once in a while and said like, Pog!
[64:35.39]No, you gotta be fucking talking and not like writing on a piece of paper and turning it to chat every five minutes.
[64:43.39]He's got to be like, whoa, this is crazy.
[64:45.30]This reminds me of how many tickets I could get at the crazy machine.
[64:48.81]They fucked that up big time.
[65:02.14]I missed the crazy machine.
[65:03.58]No, I'm just saying they had an opportunity.
[65:13.53]Stop a role-playing?
[65:15.65]I'm just talking as Chuck.
[65:23.10]There goes the Chuck E. Cheese sponsorship.
[65:25.65]If you think that I should take a Chuck E. Cheese sponsorship,
[65:32.08]As a 40 year old.
[65:34.54]I'm sorry.
[65:36.19]There's something I'm telling you that I got to tell you, you're fucking something wrong there.
[65:43.48]If I went and did like a Chuck E. Cheese and did like a sponsored video, are you crazy?
[65:50.71]Wow, you got yourself 100 tickets.
[65:52.46]No, I don't want to do that.
[66:10.42]like a sponsored let's go to Chuck E. Cheese stream.
[66:13.97]It'd be like, get out of here.
[66:19.98]I would only do that if part of it was me getting thrown out or something.
[66:23.63]You know what I mean?
[66:24.07]Like part of it is like, what are you doing in here?
[66:27.86]And the whole time, while I'm getting yelled at to leave and shit, I'm talking about the deals they have.
[66:34.02]Well, wait, you mean I can't, the, the, the two for one pizza is not, is that still going?
[66:45.40]I'm sorry, I just wanted to come here and play the latest games.
[67:02.76]I have so much.
[67:04.51]Whatever this is.
[67:10.15]What is this one?
[67:10.79]Okay, I need 100,000.
[67:15.13]I love this one too.
[67:16.37]This is a good one.
[67:30.13]I love, when this guy shows up, I love this guy.
[67:32.29]He's just so fucking, he's so goofy.
[67:41.54]100K.
[67:42.80]I'm almost done.
[68:24.69]Hi.
[68:25.56]Eight million for a ruby.
[68:33.94]Uh, well, we don't, we don't.
[68:50.42]Oh no, chat doesn't understand.
[68:52.44]Chat doesn't know.
[68:58.42]Thank you.
[69:12.02]Get to 1 million and we'll buy more.
[69:39.38]That's super efficient.
[70:00.27]I did no bronze upgrades.
[70:02.13]What am I doing with all this dark matter?
[70:10.97]What the fuck is this?
[70:14.86]He became really smart really fast.
[70:18.82]Is this movie about a monkey?
[70:20.30]The chimpanzee is attacking this person.
[70:36.84]I have to see this movie.
[70:41.44]I have to see that movie.
[70:42.84]What a stupid fucking movie.
[70:47.57]That movie was about a chimpanzee that attacks people.
[70:52.19]What?
[70:54.08]Honey.
[70:55.32]Uh, we're making plans on January 9th.
[70:58.28]We're going to see that movie in theaters.
[71:04.16]What a stupid fucking movie.
[71:06.11]Okay.
[71:07.00]Well...
[71:08.87]The movie's just called Primate.
[71:14.17]Dude, that's so stupid
[71:42.55]Another Jerm-a-slop game?
[71:44.00]That is not... That is...
[71:47.54]A highly reactive, toxic comment.
[71:51.18]That may as well have been nuclear waste, what you just said.
[71:53.77]Time that person off for ten minutes.
[72:20.80]I just keep thinking about that chimpanzee movie.
[72:23.62]I think about the time, the energy, the money.
[72:26.91]The amount of people... Because some guy was like, you know what movie I think we should make?
[72:32.49]How about a chimpanzee that fucking just like rips people apart?
[72:38.69]Alright, let's go.
[72:44.84]Dude, they even advertised it.
[72:46.00]It said 92% on rotten tomatoes.
[72:50.07]I mean it seems like that's the kind of movie everyone's just kind of looking for right now.
[73:05.86]It's playing itself 100% straight as well.
[73:11.35]I'm so curious now.
[73:43.42]Alright, what do we need?
[73:48.84]A wave that will roll this...
[73:50.81]Wait, unlock a wave.
[74:05.60]Oh shit, definitely that.
[74:07.41]12,000.
[74:10.76]How do you get a wave?
[74:11.49]They said 5% chance for a wave.
[74:15.79]I can't tell if I'm doing... Oh, it is doing it.
[74:42.54]I took it back.
[74:43.04]Can you please explain this game?
[74:46.60]Life.
[74:58.25]I was hoping that was going to be that chimpanzee movie ad.
[75:19.58]Can we please get a full review of it?
[75:21.07]Yes I will give you the full breakdown
[75:25.48]It's going to be a spoiler chat.
[75:27.54]So whenever I see it, we'll talk about it.
[75:56.59]Nice.
[75:59.00]Nice.
[76:04.06]Nice.
[76:04.58]Nice.
[76:06.59]I want this one.
[76:07.21]So this one is 40,000.
[76:08.46]Okay.
[76:09.06]Max that out.
[76:18.78]Oh, boy.
[76:48.19]Why does that not cross my mind?
[76:50.65]How many people are here?
[76:52.63]There's 10,000 people watching.
[76:54.74]Like, I'm just throwing dice in the air.
[76:58.21]This is hitting me right now.
[76:59.25]I looked over at my OBS preview.
[77:02.16]And it's almost like that made it real, what was going on, you know what I mean?
[77:07.06]I'm just imagining this screen being shown to that many people.
[77:15.31]That's too many people.
[77:22.85]I'm on my second monitor?
[77:24.62]Alright, that makes sense.
[77:30.46]We can leave if we want to?
[77:31.78]That's true too.
[77:36.77]Just with this music playing, it all kind of crashed down on me at the same time.
[77:53.60]I just want to see the end.
[78:21.54]Withering Waiting Room?
[78:23.11]It's going to be very soon.
[78:26.23]What time is it right now?
[78:27.89]Alright, we are moving to Withering Rooms within the next 30 minutes.
[78:32.58]I'm going to take another break.
[78:35.27]And we're going to play Withering Rooms for like an hour or two.
[78:51.70]dude, I need some more money.
[78:52.73]I need to multiply this shit.
[79:14.09]Damn.
[79:17.16]Holy shit, that's a lot more.
[79:18.42]More.
[79:20.59]I can get all these.
[79:22.25]I forgot how cheap these were.
[79:25.08]Much more multipliers.
[79:26.46]You get the whole thing.
[79:32.37]Plus five income to all dice?
[79:41.23]Roll random dice on roll complete.
[79:45.01]Roll current dice again.
[79:46.31]Oh, that's good.
[79:49.02]1% chance of rolling concurrent dice again.
[79:51.84]This is going to compound.
[79:55.96]Okay, what else can I do here?
[79:59.05]Idle mode, don't care about that.
[80:00.34]15% more income to all dice.
[80:08.53]There is nobody in the room who's a better gift giver than me.
[80:11.75]But you know, there's no gatekeeping around here.
[80:13.99]I'm telling you right now.
[80:17.96]Okay, we're going to get bronze all the way up after this.
[80:28.49]Where are these all coming from?
[80:29.92]I'm on YouTube and I'm on a separate tab that's not logged in.
[80:35.73]But I'm not even mad about it because I never would have even cared to know about that chimpanzee movie.
[80:50.90]Advertising works.
[80:53.97]I'm going to see that movie now.
[80:57.37]They got one of us.
[80:58.17]They got me.
[80:59.47]But I feel like that movie was made specifically for me though.
[81:03.77]Do you know what I'm saying?
[81:04.55]I don't think I would care either if it was something else.
[81:06.70]If it was any other animal, I wouldn't care.
[81:16.16]Dude, they made, okay, they made a movie like that where it was a bear.
[81:19.78]And I was like, eh, I don't care.
[81:22.90]They just made that bear, that cocaine bear movie, and they've replaced it with a chimpanzee.
[81:27.26]Now I want to go.
[81:55.97]30,000.
[82:11.83]That unclicked one at the top is killing me.
[82:15.27]Which one?
[82:15.65]See?
[82:17.84]I got him.
[82:20.87]Wait.
[82:24.98]That one?
[82:30.16]Random dice?
[82:34.33]Other one.
[82:50.75]Yeah, hey, speedrun this game.
[83:07.24]Okay, that's this whole quadrant done.
[83:13.62]We can make the fingers better too.
[83:15.31]I'm gonna do that next.
[83:37.75]I should have done this so much longer ago.
[83:39.26]Are you kidding me?
[83:39.75]Look at how much faster it is.
[83:55.80]Diamond dice.
[84:10.69]200k for that?
[84:12.95]Shit.
[84:14.70]That's the last one to get though.
[84:18.05]I'm getting close to the end.
[84:32.88]I'm just only building to 200k.
[84:35.12]Nothing else matters right now.
[84:56.50]Who wants to see me get to the end of the impossible quiz game?
[85:02.74]I thought about that the other day too.
[85:10.59]200k is so much.
[85:25.98]No, do it right.
[85:31.22]Do it the right way.
[85:35.09]Get all the dark matter pluses.
[85:38.09]Pluses, pluses, pluses.
[85:44.58]you
[85:54.16]96,000 for this other one.
[86:04.63]Yeah, dark matter and buyable dice.
[86:06.71]That's what we're going for now.
[86:10.58]Thanks for watching!
[86:15.93]Oh.
[86:26.28]God, that scared the shit out of me.
[86:28.24]Are you guys hearing the steam things?
[86:35.14]I gotta turn those down.
[86:36.63]Where are they even coming from?
[86:48.55]you
[87:01.88]Let's see if I can get sneaky here.
[87:03.17]Hold on.
[87:10.14]There we go.
[87:50.52]Hey, rent is due?
[87:51.67]What do you mean?
[87:56.74]What if you saw this shit on a table at Circus Circus?
[87:59.23]I'd be like, um, I don't know what it is, but I'm gonna put five dolls on the table and see that and just see what happens.
[88:20.01]Six million?
[88:31.37]Can do better than that.
[88:32.92]Come on.
[88:42.78]I like this song too.
[88:44.02]It's very stressful.
[88:58.66]I'm so close.
[88:59.48]I need... Alright.
[89:03.40]I'm getting the 200,000 dark matter.
[89:04.91]I'm good.
[89:18.27]So much to upgrade anything.
[89:35.70]I want you guys to look at the income.
[89:37.33]Wait.
[89:41.87]Oh, fuck.
[89:42.35]There we go.
[89:42.80]I can see it now.
[89:49.13]What's my, uh, DPS?
[89:51.00]230,000?
[89:53.07]This is spirals?
[89:54.26]Small spiral, big spiral.
[89:55.47]Small spiral, big spiral.
[89:58.53]About 200 to 230?
[89:59.82]Okay, what if I do the sweep?
[90:12.55]Nope.
[90:13.46]What about the scrape?
[90:19.57]No.
[90:20.38]Spiral's better.
[90:21.11]What about Crazy Tom?
[90:29.97]I mean, it's crazy town, but I think Spiral's better.
[90:32.17]It doesn't hurt as much.
[90:40.51]Holy shit, I got a lot.
[90:47.71]Almost there.
[91:00.38]Hey dude, what are you even doing?
[91:02.85]What are you doing?
[91:04.99]Jerma, what are you even doing, man?
[91:11.97]what who whoever does why does anyone do anything I don't know I'm just being me I'm just vibing
[91:26.03]Alright, here comes the loud sound.
[91:28.59]Alright, we got Diamond.
[91:38.82]It's gonna get crazy.
[91:42.51]My first diamond!
[92:03.59]Music's stressing me out.
[92:04.93]I know, that's what it's doing.
[92:25.90]The FPS actually has not dropped, which is kind of crazy.
[92:28.32]I bet you if I had the numbers still it would be horrible.
[92:35.40]Is that it?
[92:39.18]Wait, unlock chance of rolling lower rank dice on collision?
[92:44.51]That seems huge.
[92:49.73]So when they bump into each other, they can roll again?
[92:53.93]Holy shit.
[92:54.57]Look at that.
[92:57.49]This year, I'm holiday shopping with the Google Holiday 100.
[93:00.60]I'm not doing that.
[93:01.43]It's a list of the most popular products.
[93:03.03]I don't fucking care.
[93:12.29]What was it?
[93:12.73]10 million.
[93:13.23]This actually went up crazy.
[93:14.68]I gotta upgrade that.
[93:31.56]I want all this.
[93:32.53]It's absolutely crazy.
[93:39.39]I love this one this music is so cool it's just so weird
[93:52.82]Yeah.
[93:58.52]Yeah.
[94:11.08]It's like two notes, but it's so good though.
[94:13.58]It's just so weird.
[94:18.27]this sometimes this will just happen when you're like fighting an enemy it's just like this music there's no music
[94:27.04]It's just the scary sounds.
[94:43.94]You gotta go play Look Outside.
[94:45.25]You just don't get it.
[95:07.48]10 million?
[95:09.04]Okay, hold on.
[95:18.45]Alright, I gotta go back and get the other dice.
[95:21.36]What happens if I beat it?
[95:23.09]Do I win?
[95:23.65]What do I win?
[95:30.55]I thought you were gonna play Terminator in Withering Rooms tonight.
[95:32.69]What happened?
[95:34.08]I've been playing this for like five hours, I know.
[95:36.47]I opened this and I just couldn't stop.
[95:55.18]I'm just like sitting here doing this.
[96:04.48]Hey, you remind me of my mom and I say that nicely?
[96:06.78]Well, thanks, Mom.
[96:27.65]Shoot projectiles.
[96:45.74]I went all in.
[96:49.18]talking about if I'm going to play Withering Rooms or not.
[96:53.79]You bet the house on that, apparently.
[96:55.72]I know that's what you're referring to.
[97:07.09]I'm gonna play it, don't worry.
[97:21.68]That was abrupt and scary.
[97:27.51]100 million dollars for Diamond increased upgrade?
[97:30.96]I don't know man, am I gonna see the end?
[97:37.09]100 million for... No, dude, I don't think I'm going to do this.
[97:53.98]Thank you.
[98:02.07]I got so much more bronze stuff to get.
[98:19.48]Okay, let's focus on helper hand speed.
[98:27.31]Thank you.
[98:46.70]I'm actually getting kind of hungry.
[98:49.02]What should I eat?
[98:49.97]Hmm...
[98:53.96]I don't think... Maybe like a pizza.
[98:58.28]Sounds good.
[98:58.75]Ooh, you know what?
[98:59.37]Maybe like tacos.
[99:01.11]Oh, you know what that means.
[99:03.18]You know what that means when he starts talking about that stuff.
[99:10.48]Panic sell everything.
[99:16.60]The believers are going to win tonight.
[99:18.03]I'm just telling you.
[99:19.71]I promise you.
[99:21.46]Don't fret.
[99:22.69]Do not get concerned.
[99:25.38]I know you're all, oh, I went all in, I went all in.
[99:27.80]I'm... Believers never win on this channel.
[99:33.64]I'm going to assure that they do tonight.
[99:40.23]If you chose to believe this time, this time it's going to be different.
[99:45.46]This time it's going to be different.
[99:46.34]This time it's going to be different.
[99:47.15]I let you down every time.
[99:49.68]Not tonight.
[99:51.48]Those of you doubters that have continued, continued to doubt because it's the right thing to do, the correct move.
[100:01.09]You're about to get fucking destroyed.
[100:31.24]This one, one more.
[100:52.82]I'm like breathing heavy doing this.
[101:09.68]Hey, I tried a cheesy gordita crunch recently because it really is the best menu item.
[101:14.01]It's the only item you should order there.
[101:17.56]That and the Doritos taco is the only thing I get at Taco Bell.
[101:21.24]I actually haven't been in a very long time, but it's the only order.
[101:36.26]I'd rather watch you play pick Ross.
[101:39.38]Well, this is what's for dinner tonight, so you can either eat it or not.
[102:13.17]I'm neglecting the dice roll speed.
[102:17.12]Are we stranded?
[102:23.02]I'm just waiting to see if there's an animal in this one.
[102:27.60]When you're a AAA member, you're covered in anyone's car.
[102:32.20]Okay, there was no animal in that one.
[102:43.14]There's three ads I have to watch.
[102:44.50]Hold on.
[102:46.13]I can't skip these ones.
[102:48.14]Yes, I can.
[102:51.08]Alright.
[102:57.41]you
[103:04.63]dung dung dung dung dung dung dung dada dung dung dung dung dung dung dung dung dung dung dada dung dung dung
[103:19.16]Why don't you have YouTube Premium?
[103:20.31]I'm not logged in.
[103:21.18]If I was logged in, I wouldn't see any ads.
[103:23.04]I'm just too lazy to log in right now.
[103:34.74]Dude, UFO 50 is definitely like in the top five game of the year.
[103:38.22]It might even be like three.
[103:40.15]I think, okay, I would tie that.
[103:42.32]with White Knuckle for third.
[103:48.05]That was great.
[103:48.71]That was wonderful.
[104:07.06]How's the stats looking?
[104:12.96]This is dog shit.
[104:14.85]Look at how fucking terrible this is.
[104:16.49]Look at how much better the lower ones are.
[104:20.32]What a piece of shit.
[104:21.66]Why am I carrying...
[104:22.89]Hold on a minute.
[104:25.86]The regular dice is so much better.
[104:50.31]Why is that such a scam?
[105:06.66]I gotta get that higher.
[105:10.76]I gotta get the maximum or something.
[105:12.49]No, they're...
[105:14.50]Oh, that's the amount of times they've been rolled, not how much they're worth right now.
[105:20.54]Okay.
[105:23.77]Never mind, we're fine.
[105:47.21]Okay, the hands are maxed out.
[105:56.28]Dark matter.
[106:11.88]I almost said 100 million.
[106:13.05]What was it to upgrade?
[106:14.06]Okay, it was 100 million for that.
[106:15.57]I'm doing it.
[106:20.60]Get the ones that activate each other.
[106:22.24]I'll do that after this 100 million.
[106:42.14]So close.
[106:42.96]Come on.
[106:43.24]100 million!
[106:50.44]Alright, that's gonna probably skyrocket now.
[106:52.35]What is the income now?
[106:56.94]Okay, this is a million a second.
[106:59.01]Just for the diamonds, pretty much.
[107:15.95]This is where it steamrolls.
[107:21.34]Jeremiah the Bellagio is calling, they miss you.
[107:24.66]Here's the difference.
[107:25.39]This is not money.
[107:26.61]This is just goofy bucks.
[107:28.63]This is meaningless.
[107:43.83]Get this thing maxed out.
[107:51.15]I kinda need more dice, don't you think?
[107:58.60]I need more dice.
[108:15.15]Does your wrist hurt?
[108:17.42]No, it's fine.
[108:28.08]Style and substance in the GMC Sierra.
[108:45.16]We're going to max out diamond dice.
[108:47.33]That's what we're going for.
[108:48.21]That's the plan right now.
[109:02.18]The Terminator part of the stream was so loud.
[109:04.12]Was it really?
[109:11.46]OK, now we want collision.
[109:16.36]I don't know what I just what I just click.
[109:20.78]Consecutive increase combo.
[109:22.70]Make a combo and gain multiplier when rolled consecutively.
[109:25.87]Increase number under one second.
[109:29.68]What does that mean?
[109:48.18]Oh, I see.
[109:48.67]It's like times 1, 1.5.
[109:49.85]If I just keep doing this, am I going to keep getting multiplied forever?
[109:56.64]Hold on.
[109:57.44]It's still going up.
[110:07.02]The bitrate's getting fucked up again.
[110:27.94]Okay, more multipli- I'm gonna focus on this.
[110:31.00]Yeah.
[110:32.73]This one seems to be crazy.
[110:38.93]Because it's times 1.2.
[110:40.17]Yeah.
[110:40.46]This is going to go nuts.
[110:46.01]We're all going to die here before he even plays Wuthering Rooms.
[110:48.78]I'm telling you, believers stay happy.
[110:56.38]Thank you.
[111:19.98]Alright, 30 minutes from... No.
[111:22.31]In 15 minutes, I'm moving to Withering Rooms.
[111:25.11]I gotta make this last 15 minutes count.
[111:30.02]Thanks for watching!
[112:18.93]I just realized.
[112:22.20]Hold on.
[112:24.64]I gotta close my blinds.
[112:25.56]For a second, I'm beating off through the window.
[112:27.83]Hold on a second.
[112:28.39]I'll be right back.
[112:34.82]Just fuckin' beatin' off my fuckin' job.
[112:43.16]I'm looking fucking crazy.
[112:48.39]Oh my god!
[112:55.53]Thank you.
[113:05.52]I just had that realization.
[113:09.60]This movement right here, what do you think that looks like right now?
[113:13.23]What do you think that looks like?
[113:16.44]furiously doing this for almost an hour and a half straight bro you need to fucking settle down
[113:24.20]Right?
[113:24.84]Close all your fucking tabs, man.
[113:26.67]Like, what the fuck are you doing?
[113:30.25]Listening to this music, too?
[113:31.55]That's not alright.
[113:44.94]I don't know.
[113:46.25]What's going on with the neighbor?
[113:47.53]He's closed those fucking blinds.
[113:49.30]What is he doing?
[113:55.03]an hour.
[113:55.93]That's crazy.
[113:57.06]That's crazy.
[114:01.19]When would we call somebody about this?
[114:09.39]Alright, let me take a second here.
[114:17.23]DocMatter.
[114:30.25]Just income, income, income, income, income, income.
[114:33.99]Income, income.
[114:37.16]Diamonds are gonna go insane.
[114:49.28]We're almost at, what was it, two million a second?
[115:13.97]I don't think it would be any better if they knew you were just gambling.
[115:16.75]It's not.
[115:17.55]It's fake gambling.
[115:19.08]It's not gambling.
[115:20.20]It's incremental.
[115:21.67]It's an incremental game.
[115:44.23]It's gambling, but you can't lose.
[115:46.42]Well, is it even gambling?
[115:49.69]It's just, okay, guys, incremental games are just counting games.
[115:54.88]I've earned a total of $1 billion of fake goofy bucks.
[116:11.90]They're at about 2 million.
[116:16.37]Let me take a quick second here.
[116:17.44]What do I actually want to do?
[116:21.02]Dark matter again.
[116:21.92]Or just go for multipliers here, I think.
[116:26.52]We're in the endgame here, Peter.
[116:34.97]Where's that one where the dice hit each other?
[116:36.66]I already got it, but where is it?
[116:41.21]This is the one hit collide.
[117:02.55]Oh fuck, down here too.
[117:04.21]Don't neglect that bottom part.
[117:13.68]Okay, I'm going to go for the $160 million.
[117:33.11]What happened to 15 minutes?
[117:34.05]It's been like two.
[117:35.83]It's been three minutes.
[117:41.11]Imagine the doubters win again tonight.
[117:43.00]Oh, I would never be able to... You should never bet on me ever again if that happened.
[117:52.26]I keep thinking about somebody seeing what I'm doing.
[118:01.25]Alright, what's the income now?
[118:13.24]It feels like it didn't really go up.
[118:21.94]What is the goal?
[118:28.58]Do I have a final thing to buy?
[118:35.38]Dude, is there even a goal?
[118:40.22]What's the goal?
[118:43.12]Thanks for watching!
[119:05.14]The goal is to make money.
[119:15.54]How big is the skill tree possibly?
[119:17.27]I mean, there's only, diamond is the only thing that's here.
[119:19.38]There's nothing after diamond.
[119:25.85]Okay, my right hand actually is starting to feel, um, it's like tingling.
[119:33.43]Hold on a second.
[119:35.97]You have to unlock all the stuff to beat the game.
[119:41.59]Alright, I'm good.
[119:43.49]Let's let the machine do it for a little bit.
[119:54.77]Okay, let's do... Movement speed.
[120:02.50]Maybe I should have done this.
[120:04.16]I should have done this all along.
[120:16.00]No, it's not fast enough
[120:27.76]Alright, we're going for 256 million.
[120:52.21]It's not over, everybody chill.
[121:03.03]I like Leather Jacket.
[121:04.86]It's a mod of the channel.
[121:06.92]I see this in writing this.
[121:08.75]I have 30k points on no.
[121:11.73]Holly, find a way to make the house smell like pizza.
[121:17.66]It doesn't matter.
[121:18.37]Any delicious scents are not going to get me to get out of here.
[121:41.19]256.
[121:46.28]And then we're truly in the endgame.
[121:54.40]Jeremiah, I'm going to leave if you stop playing the dice game.
[121:56.73]I fucking hate withering rooms.
[121:58.10]Well, are you trying to get yourself timed out for like an hour?
[122:00.00]What's wrong with you?
[122:08.74]Thank you.
[122:16.03]Okay Collision Boom That's gonna go insane
[122:24.01]That's gonna go insane.
[122:26.31]So is this upgrade the fuck out of this?
[122:29.67]Massive collision.
[122:41.94]Almost already at 100 million.
[123:03.50]What is this one?
[123:04.83]Okay.
[123:06.15]Yep.
[123:09.91]I'm only going into diamonds.
[123:18.81]I'm gonna focus a little bit of time on getting to 55 diamonds.
[123:24.22]Just go right outside the door and waft in some garlic powder.
[123:27.51]Um, no.
[123:28.36]I'm gonna be fine.
[123:40.21]Here's what you can do.
[123:42.08]You can take the screen and minimize it to like a...
[123:45.20]10 pixel by 10 pixel window, you can get the gist of what's going on, right?
[123:50.10]Just make it like a 200 by 200 window on one of your monitors, or on your main monitor, doesn't matter.
[123:55.19]then you just you don't have to look at all this you can listen to the nice music you still see what's going on and then maximize that screen we get to withering rooms it's fucking easy
[124:11.81]Does that count as a view on Twitch?
[124:14.14]Or does it count as like a third of a view?
[124:17.35]Are you watching in a window that's 20% size?
[124:19.80]Is that 20% of a view?
[124:22.26]How does it count?
[124:28.89]The easiest way to be the best gift giver this year?
[124:31.34]Just ask Google.
[124:33.16]Check out the Google Holiday 100.
[124:34.44]I have a better idea.
[124:36.39]Talk to your fucking friends.
[124:56.73]How about ask your mother what she wants for Christmas this year?
[125:15.30]How about some Super Mario music?
[125:17.10]How about we put on the best song on the CD?
[125:29.56]This one's great too.
[125:32.15]It's coming up.
[125:43.46]This one's a good song.
[125:45.08]Alright, you ready?
[125:48.51]This is probably the best song on the entire CD.
[125:53.04]This track is nuts.
[125:56.32]It's awesome.
[125:58.14]We're going to turn it up.
[125:59.89]Here we go.
[126:07.73]So if you want to jam out, let's jam out here.
[126:14.05]Alright, you ready?
[126:14.61]Let's go.
[126:16.13]It's going to be loud.
[126:16.80]Jam out.
[126:33.43]Thank you.
[126:45.51]Alright, here we go.
[126:54.47]Thank you.
[128:02.36]I can't believe he jacked off with an open window for two hours.
[128:57.37]Thank you.
[130:04.20]Hey, you're muted?
[130:05.20]Dude, I may as well just have a cigarette in my mouth just sitting here.
[130:08.91]They're like, yeah, I'm just doing this.
[130:58.28]That song is called the gaze.
[131:00.57]It's a great song.
[131:06.14]Oh, that's what was wrong with my computer.
[131:07.37]That's just the game audio.
[131:14.43]Cross off your holiday gift list.
[131:19.53]Okay, for a second, I thought I played this for so long and did so much that my computer was fucked up.
[131:25.50]Do you hear that faint like... That's the game.
[131:52.01]It's time.
[131:58.94]It's time.
[132:00.73]It's time to...
[132:06.32]This is gonna take like a fucking three hours to see the end of this.
[132:22.57]I don't, there is no end, somebody said.
[132:24.48]There's no end?
[132:25.24]Oh, it's just, oh, but I can't, hold on.
[132:53.55]What is this one?
[133:04.17]Dude, that's insane.
[133:05.64]160,000.
[133:06.59]Alright, I'm doing this until this song is over.
[133:14.29]Just leave it on in the background.
[133:15.50]I will.
[133:23.07]I'm going to mute all audio.
[133:24.41]We're going to upgrade to idle mode.
[133:42.05]Alright, I'm going to do one more diamond income, upgrade the idle to maxed, take a break, come back, have this in the background, and play Withering Rooms.
[134:02.66]And we'll see where it is in like an hour.
[134:32.10]Alright, 655 million.
[134:46.36]Then Multiplier.
[134:49.54]Then I'm out.
[134:55.44]Can I put it in a window?
[135:02.85]I can.
[135:03.86]Okay, I can put like a 10 FPS limit on it.
[135:06.72]Holy shit, I didn't even click that button once.
[135:14.90]Alright.
[135:25.63]One more in here and I'm good.
[135:28.84]22,000.
[135:29.45]And that's it.
[135:31.43]And we'll play Withering Rooms.
[135:40.53]That's fine.
[135:42.44]It's not ideal, but it's fine.
[135:43.65]I can't... Where's my mouse?
[135:54.12]Any more idle things?
[136:12.24]Bitrate is so bad.
[136:20.98]Holy fucking shit.
[136:23.27]Wait a minute.
[136:31.51]Are we good?
[136:39.97]Alright, we're good.
[136:44.45]Let's let it run.
[136:45.10]There's a few more idols on the left.
[136:58.43]Where do you see that?
[137:05.19]The ruby dice have to be powered up.
[137:07.99]Oh fuck.
[137:11.67]Oh my god man, what have I done?
[137:17.31]Oh man, what have I done?
[137:18.82]Oh my god.
[137:20.40]Oh, fuck.
[137:32.09]Mmm...
[137:41.71]Okay, here's the plan.
[137:43.58]So full screen off.
[137:49.74]Audio zero.
[137:54.50]shrinking it.
[137:58.14]So if I go like this
[138:02.64]Do you really?
[138:03.52]I'm not having that on the screen.
[138:07.30]I'm gonna put it on a different monitor.
[138:15.34]Okay, it's over on a different monitor.
[138:20.46]Hey, I got the fucking Predator Orion 7000, okay?
[138:23.91]I can run that in the background.
[138:27.05]I hope.
[138:34.95]Alright, I'm gonna take a quick break.
[138:36.14]I'll be right back and we will do, hey, believers.
[138:41.99]Are you ready to win?
[138:42.79]I'm going to play Withering Rooms for like an hour.
[138:46.39]I'll be right back.
[146:31.86]I'm back.
[146:33.74]Yo.
[146:38.54]Uh, I'm getting kind of like tired.
[146:41.46]Not sure about like the rest of the stream.
[146:43.55]I'm thinking I might take like a... Take a little bit.
[146:46.72]Take a break or something.
[146:48.24]Get a little bit of sleep and uh...
[146:51.85]Believers win.
[146:58.54]Okay, let's open it.
[146:59.64]The last thing we did in Withering Rooms, if you remember, is we were on our way to kill the first witch.
[147:10.45]Can you have two games open on Steam at the same time?
[147:21.49]Like, if I open this, will it...
[147:24.18]Does Steam not let you do that?
[147:30.29]Okay.
[147:31.91]I think it worked.
[147:34.25]Yeah, it did.
[147:45.21]I'll turn it up.
[147:59.12]Okay, 1.8 billion.
[148:01.27]Hold on, let me just do a little bit.
[148:02.21]Let me just get some to stop.
[148:03.42]Hold on one sec.
[148:08.26]Give me one second.
[148:13.48]Thank you.
[148:35.62]Let me just upgrade a couple things real quick.
[148:41.34]Thank you.
[148:54.91]Just to get it going.
[148:55.61]Just to get it going.
[148:56.31]I guess some days you gotta get it going.
[149:04.64]Just to get it moving.
[149:08.97]Okay.
[149:09.75]Alright, I'm done with that.
[149:14.65]Wait, does it have to be on screen to have it work?
[149:18.21]Oh shit, it has to be...
[149:18.93]I think it has to be visible on a screen.
[149:22.59]I'll put it in my other monitor.
