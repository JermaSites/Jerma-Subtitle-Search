[00:03.41]Give me the heals.
[00:05.21]I've got all the heals.
[00:06.33]Got the black box heals.
[00:08.27]Got the conqueror heals.
[00:11.36]I want some half-satoichi heals.
[00:15.98]Oh, my flog pyro.
[00:19.08]I got the medic heals.
[00:20.42]Thank you, Gemma.
[00:21.34]Is he dead?
[00:22.24]Oh, I don't know.
[00:23.85]Good question.
[00:24.35]I think they're up top above us.
[00:28.21]Blown the horn.
[00:29.35]Oh, there's a teleport up top.
[00:35.75]Oh, the door shut on me.
[00:37.43]Yes, no!
[00:38.69]Come on, let me in.
[00:39.41]No!
[00:41.53]Engie.
[00:42.29]Engie, please, come on.
[00:45.17]Come on, dude.
[00:46.57]I just want to play.
[00:47.75]Oh my god, this scout.
[00:50.15]I can't hit him, he's too fast.
[00:56.39]Got a Mini-Sentry.
[00:57.69]Come on, Engie, dude, let me in.
[00:59.79]Yes!
[01:00.25]Another Angelipnean!
[01:01.29]Just shot myself out of the damn door!
[01:03.00]Actually, it's probably just as well.
[01:04.56]I have 13 health left.
[01:06.38]I need some health to spawn.
[01:07.66]Whoa.
[01:09.23]Somebody wants to trade with me.
[01:10.31]I mean, I like trading, but not now.
[01:12.73]I didn't even mean to do that.
[01:14.90]Do what?
[01:16.82]I don't know how I accidentally activated the crits, but I did.
[01:19.90]That's why I jumped on top and made it from the top, then I must've just, in the freakout, I must've just hit right-click accidentally.
[01:27.08]Yeah, it happens.
[01:28.60]It's better than, like, risking dying and not using it at all.
[01:31.11]Right, they're all at the top to our left, so I'll... Actually, I'll just go up now.
[01:36.81]I'm used to having three rockets.
[01:40.19]I'm used to the default, four rockets.
[01:42.35]Like, default wouldn't have been a problem.
[01:43.49]I would've had one more rocket, would've got that double kill.
[01:46.41]That's why I'm not sure how I feel about the black box.
[01:48.56]I just don't like having only three.
[01:52.82]God, don't go up there!
[01:55.46]Turn immediately background.
[02:00.54]Love the sound on that Conqueror.
[02:02.82]Or Contra.
[02:05.90]Oh my god, okay.
[02:10.03]Come on.
[02:10.59]I'm sorry, I like wasting your crits.
[02:14.19]I got like one kill with that.
[02:16.17]Pyro following us up.
[02:17.25]Okay.
[02:20.47]Come on.
[02:21.03]Oh, that guy's gonna do it.
[02:22.19]That guy's gonna do it.
[02:24.57]Wait, you're still alive?
[02:26.85]I thought you'd been murdered by the Pyro.
[02:31.03]Oh, let me in!
[02:32.03]Shit.
[02:32.75]I nearly got stuck in my hamster toys, that would've sucked.
[02:34.95]There's not a lot I can do, I can hear him building shit.
[02:40.76]Okay then, you're real.
[02:41.60]I could have sworn that you were a spy.
[02:44.13]And there was a big engine house back there.
[02:45.79]There's a flock of pyro following me.
[02:49.71]Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
[02:54.81]Oh, that guy had him.
[02:58.23]Look how fast the conqueror charges.
[03:01.85]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh my god, that was scary.
[03:07.86]I almost just got hit by a friggin' arrow in the face.
[03:12.82]I could see him aiming at me too, it was terrifying.
[03:15.66]Still not sure how I feel about, like, three rockets.
[03:18.20]Just that one less rocket is such a big deal.
[03:19.76]You know what, you're ready.
[03:20.98]Actually, let me turn this corner.
[03:22.00]Oh.
[03:24.24]Let me know if you need it.
[03:27.12]Oh no, there's no one up here.
[03:32.10]Oh, here we go.
[03:32.96]There we go.
[03:35.79]Ah, come on, where are you?
[03:36.59]Oh, I actually got some of that.
[03:37.77]I think there was someone coming around here, a medic, maybe.
[03:40.59]Don't burn to death.
[03:42.43]Or a spy.
[03:45.65]Gotcha.
[03:50.67]Watch these soldiers in the window.
[03:52.11]Yep.
[03:52.23]Trying to get him with the katana.
[03:57.01]Oh!
[03:57.67]Jumped into each other.
[03:59.29]I'm, like, stuck on this shit now.
[04:03.67]Oh, I hope somebody comes to me.
[04:05.91]Yes!
[04:08.31]Ran out of crit, go figure.
[04:10.07]What a pyro again.
[04:13.23]I'm over here.
[04:14.38]Thanks.
[04:15.78]Oh, can't cry.
[04:16.88]This thing's always ready to go.
[04:18.74]Is that a spy?
[04:19.98]No, that's not a spy.
[04:22.38]Hey, achievement.
[04:23.90]Oh, here we go.
[04:27.38]Come here.
[04:28.52]Jesus Christ.
[04:31.73]Oh, I found that whole team.
[04:33.95]Holy jeez.
[04:34.83]Alright.
[04:35.99]Big half Satoshi.
[04:36.79]Here we go.
[04:37.73]Heavy's everywhere.
[04:39.55]Oh, my God.
[04:41.09]He's got destroyed.
[04:45.76]There's so many heavies, fuck!
[04:47.30]I was like... Did the whole team go heavy?
[04:49.54]I was like, half Satoshi, here we go.
[04:52.20]Fuck!
[04:53.98]Three miniguns just planted on my face.
[04:55.82]Okay.
[04:57.16]Are they gonna get it?
[04:58.18]Yeah, they have curts.
[05:00.16]I think they are, yeah.
[05:01.26]Okay.
[05:03.18]Alright.
[05:04.26]Well, I mean, how many are there?
[05:06.11]Oh, okay.
[05:09.11]Oh, Jesus, guys, there's no way.
[05:10.43]GG.
[05:10.79]That was a good game.
[05:15.11]We were defending them for like fucking six minutes straight.
[05:17.81]What happened?
[05:18.87]They all just went heavy and shredded us.
[05:20.03]They all went heavy.
[05:21.55]And medic.
[05:24.06]That was a fun round.
