[ve:60.16.100]

[00:06.74]Hello?
[00:08.78]Burke?
[00:10.29]You guys actually hold on.
[00:13.79]There we go.
[00:14.21]Now you should be able to hear me.
[00:16.33]How you doing?
[00:19.63]If you're wondering about the mic change, it's because I'm using the Index Micro... Is it quiet?
[00:28.79]Hold on, let me turn it up.
[00:35.33]What is that?
[00:35.65]I wasn't wondering.
[00:39.03]Ow?
[00:39.35]What do you mean, ow?
[00:42.40]I just punched... Oh, shit.
[00:43.58]That's gonna happen, isn't it?
[00:44.44]All the time.
[00:48.10]I needed... Alright, listen.
[00:50.76]I needed freedom in my space.
[00:54.38]Okay?
[00:59.34]In that room...
[01:01.99]This is my office.
[01:04.51]It's too cramped in there.
[01:08.55]I had to upgrade my space.
[01:11.37]And that means bringing my entire computer setup, monitors, tower, keyboard, into my fucking living room.
[01:23.26]So, I would have streamed like three days ago.
[01:26.78]Because I wasn't feeling well.
[01:28.68]I had diarrhea.
[01:30.81]Bad.
[01:31.07]Bad.
[01:33.85]but I brought my entire computer into my living room.
[01:37.57]So I couldn't do anything.
[01:40.89]So I just let it run its course.
[01:43.26]I think I'm okay today, I hope so.
[01:46.90]We'll find out.
[01:49.20]You and I are gonna find out very shortly if I've gotta run away, which I hope doesn't happen.
[02:01.76]And by the way, the mic's going to sound a little better.
[02:04.13]I'm holding, look, I'm just going to go live, whatever.
[02:08.19]Okay, listen.
[02:17.58]Got an index.
[02:18.90]Oh my God.
[02:22.46]Hey, look what I got for Christmas.
[02:23.66]I got an index.
[02:24.32]I'm going to trip over the wire and fucking eat it.
[02:29.24]I have an index now.
[02:31.80]How's my hair?
[02:34.97]Probably do.
[02:39.51]What do you mean?
[02:41.19]What?
[02:45.15]No, it's because the webcam's up on a thing.
[02:48.80]I embedded it into the fucking wall.
[02:55.48]I'm going to trip over this and die.
[02:56.60]I know it.
[02:58.97]We're going to play Boneworks first.
[03:03.43]Yeah, you'll hear me better when the headset's on.
[03:07.53]It looks beautiful.
[03:13.78]I can see you guys in here.
[03:14.94]I'm just delaying it because I hate getting into this fucking thing.
[03:17.12]Because once I get in here, I know that I'm going to lose 400 or 500 hairs off the front of my head
[03:27.32]I'm just making sure you guys have an image of me with an extra 400 here.
[03:31.14]Right in the front.
[03:34.46]I'm probably cutting out.
[03:36.58]What I want, sure, that I have bears on the top of my head, right?
[03:40.22]Is that what it sounds like?
[03:41.26]That's probably what it sounds like.
[03:52.95]Also, I hope that this looks okay.
[03:57.71]Because what I've been told is the index has a higher field of view than all the other ones.
[04:03.35]By the way, pog.
[04:05.35]But it can make capturing it kind of a pain in the ass.
[04:09.11]So I have three different capture modes on this thing.
[04:14.50]I feel like I'm working on a fucking sink with somebody.
[04:18.72]And, like, they're down there.
[04:19.84]Yeah, so move two or three inches to the right.
[04:22.74]The screws are right there.
[04:24.67]God.
[04:25.97]That was a pretty good joke.
[04:27.93]Should I just, am I going in?
[04:28.89]I'm going in.
[04:30.33]I can see you guys in here.
[04:31.19]Let me get this on right.
[04:38.19]And I got that thing.
[04:38.95]Where am I?
[04:41.73]My hands aren't on the, hold on.
[04:49.83]There you are.
[04:50.35]What are you saying?
[04:52.31]Why does your room look, what?
[04:55.47]I gotta get, I got these, look at these things.
[05:01.35]Tiny hands?
[05:02.17]I have big fucking hands.
[05:04.53]My hands are actually embarrassingly large.
[05:06.37]I hate it.
[05:07.93]I don't... Why do I... Do I have to log in?
[05:13.33]Alright.
[05:14.23]This just reminded me of... I know this is a joke, but for a second I was fucking furious.
[05:19.87]Because I thought this was like Origin or something.
[05:23.23]Like you gotta log into Origin before you play the game.
[05:25.59]I was about to get really, really mad.
[05:30.03]That room makes me look tiny.
[05:32.11]It's a gigantic fucking living room.
[05:35.23]Yeah, you know who else looks small?
[05:36.77]You.
[05:37.77]When you take all the furniture out of your living room, all the couch, the chairs, the TVs, everything, you move your entire desktop into the center of the room, you probably aren't going to look six feet tall anymore.
[05:50.02]It's up, I swear.
[05:52.70]Your camera's blurry?
[05:54.40]Oh, shit, I actually forgot.
[05:55.24]You're right, you're right.
[05:55.82]Good, good, good.
[05:56.20]I'm going to stall as long as I want because once I get in, you know we're good for like
[06:00.81]We want to change the camera.
[06:34.26]you guys can't even hear me I've been talking for like a minute straight and nobody can hear me I've just been over there just just like talking nobody could hear it oh what did I just say it was such it was like a good I said it was a cool I said whatever oh right auto focus why the do people put auto focuses on a webcam it doesn't move sit in the same exact place you don't move you physically don't move
[07:29.39]I need to wear it.
[07:30.21]Otherwise my doctor is going to be mad that I did this today.
[07:38.81]Alright, here we go.
[07:39.29]What does this say?
[07:43.15]Where's my center?
[07:43.85]There we are.
[07:47.87]Hold on.
[07:48.95]Boneworks attention.
[07:50.03]Boneworks subroutine operates on highly experimental simulated physics.
[07:54.62]My pants are going to come down at some point during this stream.
[07:59.40]It's nice and tight.
[08:01.22]Look at that.
[08:04.06]Oh, he's got an index!
[08:05.86]Oh, dude, he's got an index!
[08:08.08]What the?
[08:10.58]You can't do that, unless you have one.
[08:20.51]Okay.
[08:21.85]I think I'm ready.
[08:25.63]Expert VR users only.
[08:29.20]Welcome, Director Ford.
[08:32.47]Finally, the penis stream.
[08:33.99]Please identify your real-world height.
[08:39.13]It thinks I'm 5'9".
[08:40.85]See?
[08:41.09]Oh, look at how small you look in your room.
[08:43.79]It thinks I'm 5'9".
[08:46.07]This is a big living room.
[08:49.03]But that's not how tall we really are, so let's make it accurate.
[08:54.99]Expert mode?
[09:01.25]Average height.
[09:02.81]Am I on the camera if I'm over here?
[09:04.79]Make sure I'm in the right spot.
[09:05.90]Can you guys still see me?
[09:07.84]Hmm.
[09:11.50]Yeah, that's fine.
[09:13.76]I'm gonna be... Look, I can go like... I can fucking go like this today.
[09:17.22]You know what I mean?
[09:17.66]I couldn't do that in the other room.
[09:21.47]I'm gonna be standing.
[09:23.65]Are you sure?
[09:25.87]I don't know why that just said attention.
[09:27.29]Try seated mode if you have a soul.
[09:29.31]Like, wait.
[09:29.89]What do you mean?
[09:30.59]Like, I'm soulless?
[09:34.46]I'm not concerned about my real world surroundings.
[09:36.46]I'm going to be fine.
[09:41.04]Wait, what?
[09:43.30]Is your floor okay?
[09:47.99]Yeah.
[09:49.39]Yeah, that's fine.
[09:52.99]Soulless Andy.
[09:55.21]I think that looks alright.
[09:57.19]Administrator privileges granted.
[09:59.21]Confirm measurements to proceed.
[10:01.67]You want to know the best part about the index?
[10:03.37]I know you're going to hear that.
[10:04.41]Look, by the way, I need to make a really this is a real warning for the stream.
[10:09.84]The real warning for the stream is I'm going to punch myself in the face probably twice.
[10:15.62]I'm going to say two or three times.
[10:17.81]I am using the index mic.
[10:20.61]So I am really sorry if all of a sudden you hear like an explosion because I punched myself directly in the eyes.
[10:26.33]I'm just saying it's possible.
[10:29.69]Looks fine.
[10:30.29]Yeah, save settings.
[10:40.27]Stress level zero, bone works.
[10:44.79]So that, I need to be aware of that because I put that on the ground so I don't get like killed in here.
[10:50.37]That's like where I'm safe.
[10:52.71]As long as I'm like in this area, as long as I'm in this zone here, I am safe, okay?
[11:03.68]Should I do anything?
[11:10.38]Oh, I'm not even capturing this, so who cares?
[11:12.32]This is loud too, I gotta drop this.
[11:24.86]Alright, that's better.
[11:27.84]Okay, new game.
[11:28.66]Story.
[11:35.27]Is this Zipper Down?
[11:40.26]What, are we watching a movie?
[11:42.12]By the way, I haven't done this yet.
[11:43.00]I want to do this.
[11:45.04]I want to watch a movie in VR.
[11:47.14]And pretend like I have a 500 inch screen.
[12:00.83]Movie night.
[12:09.92]Oh, I can skip this.
[12:10.94]No, don't skip.
[12:12.60]By the way, this is the middle of my room.
[12:14.02]I'm not even like on camera.
[12:16.08]I might need to recalibrate that.
[12:23.23]Should I skip the movie?
[12:24.21]No, I'm not going to skip the movie.
[12:25.61]I don't know.
[12:26.05]Look, it's quiet.
[12:32.01]Why can't I do a peace sign?
[12:33.01]That doesn't look right.
[12:42.12]What's wrong with my hands?
[12:50.72]They calibrate themselves.
[12:57.61]Object, coffee cup.
[12:59.11]Indestructible.
[13:05.80]Get the shit out of me.
[13:07.24]I thought I was too far away.
[13:09.01]Coffee cup.
[13:10.59]Oh, that felt good.
[13:16.41]These are cool.
[13:17.53]These are cool.
[13:19.13]Yeah.
[13:25.21]That's fun.
[13:26.25]I have barely played with this, by the way.
[13:27.99]Alright, wait.
[13:30.72]Put it in the archive.
[13:34.71]Like, I've barely done like this.
[13:42.13]Oh, it's weird, though.
[13:42.93]I'm not... Actually, do I pick things up like this?
[13:48.77]I think I do.
[13:52.74]Shit, it's kind of hard to get used to.
[13:54.86]What?
[13:55.16]No, pick it up.
[13:57.04]Stick my pinky out.
[13:59.50]This is freaking me out.
[14:05.18]Oh my god, this is so easy.
[14:08.97]Oh my god, it's so easy!
[14:12.13]Alright, disposal.
[14:19.67]It's so weird to do this.
[14:22.91]Honest to god, I feel like I'm stuck on this.
[14:25.56]Like... I know it's like I just have to use my hands the way that they normally are, but still...
[14:34.97]Put it in the gammon?
[14:35.85]I got a better idea.
[14:36.68]Alright.
[14:37.26]Let go!
[14:37.44]Oh, I was holding onto it.
[14:40.02]It skipped the shit out of me.
[14:44.10]I didn't let it go.
[15:03.05]How do you jump?
[15:03.69]Alright, I'm listening.
[15:04.57]Because I didn't let it go.
[15:06.57]Alright, where do I go?
[15:45.37]Do it!
[15:47.71]There we go.
[15:50.05]How's the audio?
[15:50.59]We good?
[15:54.57]Before I get really started here, I want to make sure you guys can hear me and shit.
[15:57.70]We good?
[15:58.80]Alright, let's fucking go.
[16:03.90]Snap, turn, crouch, locomotion.
[16:06.20]Oh, I don't need that.
[16:07.62]Look at this.
[16:08.36]You think I need a snap turn?
[16:13.00]You think I need a snap turn?
[16:15.37]Can't do this in the other fucking room.
[16:28.81]It's fun.
[16:29.99]It's a brick.
[16:31.42]I'm keeping this and I'm going to smash this on somebody's fucking head in like two minutes.
[16:41.52]Our minds are directly connected to the void.
[16:43.56]Boneworks.
[16:47.42]There's some kind of diamond!
[16:49.98]Why am I holding this like a jeweler?
[16:53.98]If you die in real life, do you die in the void?
[16:56.52]Probably.
[17:05.82]We're gonna fucking imagine that that's your head!
[17:09.01]Okay, we're good.
[17:14.37]Pizza?
[17:19.04]What?
[17:23.50]Nobody throw... I can't throw with my left hand, okay?
[17:26.03]You ready?
[17:26.25]You want to see?
[17:26.69]That's right hand.
[17:33.11]Perfect, right?
[17:34.07]Let's try left hand.
[17:39.41]What?
[17:39.83]How come we don't teach that in school?
[17:41.91]You know what I mean?
[17:42.47]Why don't we, like, teach people to be both left and right dominated?
[17:45.71]You know what I mean?
[17:48.31]We should teach that.
[17:50.17]Because everybody just uses the same hand for everything.
[17:56.67]Give me the... I want the fucking coffee cup.
[18:03.37]How would you get this in real life?
[18:13.00]Not bad.
[18:14.16]Let's go.
[18:18.02]Just wait, I'm fucking ready.
[18:19.18]Why am I crouching?
[18:19.85]Stand up.
[18:20.39]What's wrong with me?
[18:21.35]What's wrong with my character?
[18:47.44]Why am I cro- Stop crouching!
[18:49.24]There we go.
[18:52.58]What does it say?
[18:53.00]Alright.
[18:58.47]What?
[18:58.69]Oh, I got a gun?
[19:03.35]Okay, uh, 10 PM.
[19:06.51]Willie Arthur Ford was seen eating lunch in the anomalous object disposal break room while sitting on a- He's on a break.
[19:13.31]Checked his time.
[19:14.43]Whatever.
[19:14.71]I think I probably could- Should I take this?
[19:21.16]I probably need this.
[19:22.12]Can I use this computer?
[19:26.20]No, I want... I could have flypaper all over me.
[19:29.40]Let's go.
[19:44.65]How do I walk?
[19:50.35]I can't walk.
[19:54.04]Fix your webcam?
[19:55.92]What's wrong with it?
[19:58.34]What's wrong with it?
[19:59.34]Yeah, I'll move it up.
[20:00.15]Just give me a minute.
[20:13.19]Okay.
[20:14.25]Keycard, right?
[20:14.81]Where's the keycard go?
[20:18.91]Security director.
[20:19.83]Alright, keycard?
[20:27.64]Stop.
[20:28.16]Don't do that.
[20:36.72]God, these... These fucking hotel keys.
[20:43.15]We got bags here.
[20:45.99]Honey, go to the front desk and find out what the fuck is going on.
[20:49.61]Stupid fucking hotel key.
[20:50.89]What was that?
[21:00.19]Out of frame.
[21:00.71]Alright, let me fix it right now.
[21:02.03]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[21:02.89]Let me get, let me do, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[21:07.51]Alright, I'm just gonna turn it this way a little bit.
[21:17.89]Is that better?
[21:22.79]That's probably better, right?
[21:28.51]How's that?
[21:30.16]That's probably good.
[21:39.33]Game audio's low?
[21:40.21]It looks like it's pretty high.
[21:41.43]Alright, let's go.
[21:48.03]This looks good.
[21:48.53]I have a normal house.
[21:53.19]I almost just fucking pulled the whole tower down.
[21:59.83]Did I?
[22:00.61]No.
[22:01.21]Holy shit, that was terrifying.
[22:02.55]Alright, let's go.
[22:08.34]If I need to move it a little more, I will.
[22:09.96]I think it's in a good spot, though.
[22:12.32]Alright, you don't have any idea.
[22:13.00]I'm so excited to play with these.
[22:15.12]And I heard that this was the thing to play.
[22:18.59]I'm going to milk it.
[22:19.57]You know what I mean?
[22:20.85]I'm going to milk the fuck out of this.
[22:25.29]Sorry.
[22:25.71]Oh, I didn't tell you my favorite part about the Vive.
[22:27.63]It's not the Vive.
[22:28.19]Fucking sorry about that.
[22:29.41]It's an index.
[22:30.67]So my absolute favorite part about this whole thing is these headphones.
[22:36.15]Holy shit.
[22:37.43]They're open ear headphones.
[22:39.79]I can have these on.
[22:40.97]I can hear everything around me.
[22:42.19]I can see everything around me.
[22:44.08]It's unbelievable.
[22:45.10]It's the best feature of the entire Vive by far.
[22:48.38]Holy shit.
[22:48.82]It's unbelievable.
[22:51.48]Mega milk.
[22:54.78]Alright, I feel like I'm gonna need this.
[23:01.29]And I'm gonna need a quarter brick!
[23:04.47]Where am I?
[23:04.89]Okay.
[23:05.63]Look, here's another thing.
[23:06.53]I'm scared to be in a big open space.
[23:09.16]Because I feel like it's more dangerous for me to be in a huge open space.
[23:12.82]Because I'm not scared to, like, go like this!
[23:15.82]But, like, I lost the keycard.
[23:18.04]But I feel like that's even worse.
[23:20.04]Because I'm gonna run through my wall like a Looney Tunes cartoon.
[23:23.21]You understand?
[23:28.65]You're nude.
[23:29.11]What are you talking about, my pants down?
[23:31.47]I'm wearing like a abdomen chest brace thing, so it's probably what you see.
[23:36.41]I'm still out of frame?
[23:40.39]I can't, it's not perfect, I have a big room here.
[23:43.07]Okay, snap right turn, yeah I know.
[23:47.58]Oh my god.
[23:51.10]Yep, no, I want this.
[23:53.66]Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me, bro.
[24:03.16]I wanna keep this.
[24:14.38]I'm gonna start a fight.
[24:20.49]Game with us.
[24:21.23]Monogon.
[24:36.86]What happened?
[24:38.56]What?
[24:39.42]Oh, I think I was supposed to turn that off.
[24:42.68]Oops.
[24:49.76]Don't do it.
[24:50.31]I just hit myself in the face.

[29:46.10]Hold on.
[29:49.72]How do I run?
[29:51.98]Oh, I just hold it?
[29:52.80]This is Minecraft.
[30:12.33]So, like, in 500 years, are we going to be... Are the aliens going to think that we were Minecraft characters?
[30:19.19]People play too much.
[30:23.06]It's Roblox.
[30:25.24]Like, that's what the aliens are going to think humans are.
[30:28.10]Because we're just going to be playing Minecraft forever.
[30:32.76]No, it's not.
[30:38.68]Which is... I mean, the game's fucking phenomenal, so I can understand.
[30:50.22]You go to a museum and there's a guy just like... Why?
[30:57.52]I don't even need to see this shit.
[31:02.23]It's double stick to run?
[31:05.65]Oh, that's helpful.
[31:06.19]Thank you.
[31:07.67]Alright, let's ruin the experience for everybody here and just play both at the same time.
[31:13.02]environments and full body presence are the cornerstone for living and working in virtual spaces.
[31:21.98]Cool.
[31:23.20]What about this one?
[31:28.13]Whatever.
[31:28.71]That was cool, museum.
[31:32.61]That was fun.
[31:33.87]Alright, now what?
[31:36.05]Here comes the gift shop.
[31:37.21]Jumping is a byproduct of a sudden release of stored
[31:41.75]Tap for a quick hop.
[31:43.19]That guy's 800 rounds.
[31:47.28]Jump while crouching for a huge leap.
[31:51.46]Okay, so it's Luigi from Mario 2.
[31:53.16]Got it.
[31:53.36]Alright, that's fine.
[32:02.56]Wait, crouch.
[32:09.75]Oh!
[32:10.13]Did I make it?
[32:10.57]I did it.
[32:10.83]Alright, we're good.
[32:16.03]Alright, that was fun.
[32:25.02]A rain can be crossed by running and jumping.
[32:29.30]Why does everybody do that in every TV show and movie?
[32:33.25]Whenever there's a big jump, the character always does that.
[32:36.19]They go like this.
[32:37.01]That doesn't do anything.
[32:40.27]Get into a fucking ball.
[32:41.53]I told you it was gonna happen.
[32:43.41]I'm sorry.
[32:44.65]But get in tight, jump, and then get tight like a fucking goddamn cannonball.
[32:48.47]You'll move.
[32:48.87]Yeah, alright.
[32:56.96]Yeah, I just impressed the fuck out of, like, half of you.
[33:00.68]Uh, half of you.
[33:07.27]Climbing ge- Oh, wait, can I-
[33:15.56]I've hurt so bad!
[33:22.48]Let go!
[33:23.58]I'm not even holding it.
[33:24.34]Alright.
[33:31.56]To save additional items, place them in the platform.
[33:33.86]Alright, let's go like this.
[33:37.46]I thought that was my face.
[33:39.39]I was like, why does it have that?
[33:40.49]I thought, because look at the background.
[33:41.79]It looks like my, like, webcam room.
[33:45.23]I was like, I don't have a goatee?
[33:46.60]I was like, what's that?
[33:48.14]Where's that from?
[33:49.06]Alright, yeah, save manually if you want to.
[33:52.44]Let's go.
[33:52.80]I have this sweat coming down my ass.
[33:58.69]I think I have to take off this brace.
[34:00.41]It's like making me fucking sweat.
[34:17.31]Whoa!
[34:17.55]It's like going to the McDonald's play place and thinking you're like the man for being able to do that.
[34:34.36]Sorry, I'm facing the right way now.
[34:39.70]What the fuck?
[34:50.75]Get out of the way.
[34:53.79]Ooh!
[35:07.92]This is brick?
[35:09.16]You know it.
[35:13.28]Come on.
[35:15.65]Come on.
[35:18.03]Got it.
[35:24.40]Oh, is it heavy?
[35:26.68]Oh, this is heavy.
[35:27.28]Very cool.
[35:34.60]So much can break.
[35:36.24]So much can break.
[35:38.26]Interactable handles and grab points can be found in the environment, sure.
[35:41.35]Okay, don't be too aggressive.
[35:44.41]Oh.
[35:49.66]Holy shit.
[35:51.18]Ooh.
[36:00.44]It's like all the kids at the fucking playground.
[36:03.68]They all have like the ball.
[36:04.94]They're like, pull it harder!
[36:07.04]Harder!
[36:09.84]And finally an adult looks over and is like, no, no, no, no, no.
[36:13.72]And one of the kids gets it right in the fucking face and flies.
[36:25.92]There's a wall.
[36:29.62]Whatever.
[36:35.80]Didn't hit it?
[36:37.94]I don't care.
[36:39.00]Only hero objects can be grabbed from a distance.
[36:41.54]Okay.
[36:49.88]God damn it.
[36:51.24]They need to be thinner.
[37:06.24]That's fun.
[37:06.74]Just to do that.
[37:15.19]Cool.
[37:16.69]Move heavy objects slowly.
[37:22.85]Alright.
[37:23.03]I don't know why.
[37:24.37]Did anybody just feel like what I was just doing right there was one of those zombie iPad game ads?
[37:29.58]Where it's like all of a sudden the person's like, oh yeah, cooking a burger.
[37:32.54]And then it's like, people start running wicked fast and fucking zombies start attacking.
[37:37.40]That's how I just felt like it was happening.
[37:41.57]What?
[37:48.11]Dude, I get so many ads on Twitter.
[37:55.95]That's hard to do.
[38:05.10]Watch that form, bro.
[38:12.25]Okay.
[38:14.77]This is just like a little playground.
[38:17.29]In this game... Well, I'm not going to spoil anything.
[38:20.91]Where am I going?
[38:21.51]I'm over here.
[38:26.40]This is Double Dare.
[38:27.62]This thing has a tongue and it squeezes out people.
[38:35.33]Oh my god.
[38:36.15]I'm gonna Indiana Jones myself.
[38:42.55]Should I jump up there?
[38:51.91]Where am I?
[38:55.03]Should I jump up here?
[39:00.11]Oh!
[39:06.31]I got it.
[39:06.63]Alright, I did it.
[39:11.53]Get on top of this.
[39:12.73]What the fuck?
[39:15.87]I just punched myself in the face.
[39:20.55]Whatever.
[39:26.02]Crouch?
[39:30.28]This thing's gonna come off.
[39:34.88]Even if my chest muscles hurt and my back hurts, this thing, I'm wearing a sweat belt.
[39:42.14]It's coming off.
[39:50.76]Press it.
[39:54.16]Oh.
[39:56.33]Oh, companion cube!
[39:57.23]I know.
[40:06.11]Okay.
[40:07.57]Alright, hold on.
[40:10.33]Where are you?
[40:16.33]Hold on a sec.
[40:17.73]I'm taking this thing off.
[40:24.00]It doesn't look like I'm wearing a diaper.
[40:25.98]Hold on a second.
[40:26.56]I just gotta change my diaper really quick.
[40:33.24]Okay, that's better.
[40:34.08]That thing is just...
[40:35.48]Too much.
[40:36.28]Ugh.
[40:38.54]How we doing?
[40:42.04]Okay.
[40:43.26]I need to do this.
[40:48.56]That thing is the best.
[40:49.36]This is OVR advanced settings.
[40:51.72]That thing tells you how many times you've spun around.
[40:53.98]Awesome.
[40:55.52]Okay.
[40:55.86]Exhibit under construction.
[40:56.68]Let's go.
[41:01.32]I feel like this is a TF2 map.
[41:04.70]Don't you just feel like you're gonna see soldiers just like, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and get to the top?
[41:11.51]Are I breaking the glass?
[41:28.81]I can do that in this room.
[41:30.73]I can do that in here.
[41:38.22]What?
[41:44.01]Why can't I break that?
[41:52.16]Oops.
[41:55.24]Back it up.
[42:02.22]I can't even, I can't touch it, whatever.
[42:04.25]Break the barrels.

[44:35.24]Why did I do that?
[44:44.98]Why'd I get sucked backwards?
[44:47.16]Somebody just grabbed me by the back of the head and just pulled me.
[44:56.48]Get up here!
[45:00.80]Get... Go!
[45:13.36]What's wrong?

[50:17.00]You may find these exhibits more complex and somewhat challenging.
[50:20.84]Please take all the time you need in order to fully grasp these mechanics.
[50:23.28]We recommend taking a short break and then return to these concepts?
[50:27.97]Oh god.

[58:14.09]Keep your finger off the trigger until you're ready to shoot.
[58:15.99]Keep weapon unloaded in an equip slot until you're ready to use it.
[58:23.64]I just love how these made out of cement.
[58:57.78]That's like a 98% accuracy.
[59:02.96]Oh!
[59:03.74]That would've been sick!
[59:08.64]What's this one?
[59:16.72]Why am I crouching?
[59:21.05]Stop crouching.
[59:21.97]Get up.
[59:30.20]Fun.
[59:30.58]Alright, what else is there?
[59:31.34]Oh, wow!
[59:32.42]Where does this one go?
[59:37.97]Where does it go?
[59:45.03]Oh, okay.
[59:48.98]What?
[59:50.22]Is it ready?
[59:51.66]Hey!
[59:52.04]How do I turn it on?
[59:59.99]There we go.
[60:08.82]Cool.
[60:25.65]What is that one?
[60:34.29]What?
[60:35.41]It's hard.
[60:36.67]The index controllers are really hard to get used to.
[60:42.25]That thing was automatically firing.
[60:47.21]Because I have to physically actually hold this.
[60:50.96]With all my hands.
[61:03.32]Alright, inventory slots, cool.
[61:04.84]Ooh, what's this one?
[61:15.82]See what I'm talking about?
[61:17.02]Uh-huh, firearms are, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[61:32.82]It's the, yeah, it's because I'm gripping like, where are you?
[61:36.56]Because I'm gripping like this, right?
[61:39.86]You're supposed to do this when you hold a gun.
[61:41.38]Because this, yeah, it's tricky.
[62:01.05]That's, don't turn around.
[62:14.50]Cool.
[62:22.18]Jerma, you can't gun.
[62:23.43]Be careful.
[62:23.97]You're wasting ammo.
[62:25.19]This is just like a how to shoot the gun tutorial.
[62:28.35]Impact physics.
[62:30.35]Oh, yes.
[62:31.19]Okay.
[62:35.50]I've been waiting for this all fucking day.
[63:13.31]Ooh, there's knives?
[63:15.57]Holy shit!
[63:19.71]Come on, I gotta do it like in the movies.
[63:21.71]No, who's that guy, the League of Legends character?
[63:24.01]A twist of fate!
[63:25.70]Right?
[63:25.96]The guy that throws the whatever he is?
[64:04.10]Alright.
[64:05.78]I'm ready.
[64:15.92]I literally made a fucking mess.
[64:17.38]Let's go.
[64:20.82]Hold on.
[64:32.31]Wait, somebody...
[64:40.39]Break the ba- I gotta break the barrels?
[64:52.51]Oh shit, cool.
[65:10.04]How do I do this?
[65:26.75]I see.
[65:27.03]Okay.
[65:27.29]It's gotta go in that one spot.
[65:31.93]Should I take a gun?
[65:53.61]Alright, let's go.
[65:55.53]I take more than one gun!
[65:58.01]Where'd that- Oh, I threw the handguns.
[65:59.43]Fuck.
[66:07.22]That's not even- Where'd this come from?
[66:08.46]I don't fucking even need it.
[66:11.20]Let's go.
[66:26.53]Alright, I don't- this is not the place to be on the shooting range.
[66:32.69]I just- hold on!
[66:33.29]It's like, okay, you ever go to the driving range?
[66:38.01]Like, the driving range, right?
[66:40.39]With the club, you're hitting golf balls.
[66:43.35]And like, you hit like a little dribbler.
[66:46.13]And it goes, doop doop doop doop!
[66:48.27]10 feet in front of you.
[66:49.41]Don't go get that ball.
[66:51.01]Do not go get that ball.
[66:52.81]Don't do it.
[66:54.09]You see people do that shit.
[66:56.58]They're like, oh, oh, whoops!
[66:58.58]And they walk out there like five feet.
[67:00.38]You're gonna get a ball sliced into your head.
[67:02.40]Just don't fucking do that.
[67:03.51]Pantsless psycho, what?
[67:13.99]What?
[67:14.49]Three handguns!
[67:17.35]What the fuck?
[67:36.36]Dude, this is kind of hard to do.
[67:37.40]Am I doing this, like, wrong?
[67:42.42]It's like I can't reach that far into my body.
[67:44.34]Is it because you're crouched?
[67:57.93]Even still, this feels weird to do.
[67:59.25]Like...
[68:07.71]You need pants.
[68:11.57]You are cr- I'm not crouched.
[68:15.33]Like, you have- look at how, like, weirdly I have to look down at that.
[68:34.89]I don't- I don't need 500 bullets, I'm leaving.
[68:38.83]Like, this is... Okay, let's go.
[68:51.88]I don't care.
[68:57.89]You don't need to put... Oh, wait.
[68:59.83]What did that person say?
[69:08.23]I think we're good.
[69:17.51]You don't need to put the bullets in your pouch?
[69:33.89]Attention!
[69:34.33]The exhibits in the following chamber represent complex concepts.
[69:37.85]You may exit through the gift shop if you desire to bypass these advanced chambers.
[69:47.65]I'll be using that.
[69:55.14]I got the key.
[70:02.56]Okay.
[70:05.20]Wait, is the gift shop over there?
[70:12.16]I'm going out through the gift shop if this is too hard.
[70:13.94]I don't even care if everyone... I don't care how embarrassing that is.
[70:22.10]Time control?
[70:27.56]Whoa.
[70:35.38]Hey!
[70:41.72]What the hell?
[70:46.17]Where do I go?
[71:01.87]Trash handlers.
[71:05.92]Oh, I can move around with this!
[71:22.89]This is so hard!
[71:23.85]Hold on, I need to...
[71:37.72]Am I going to knock that down?
[71:38.64]I'm going to knock this down.
[71:58.31]Am I holding this backwards?
[72:00.35]What the fuck?
[72:12.58]This is the... What, the box?
[72:17.18]No, I have to, like, get him to come over here for something, right?
[72:22.15]Did it... Oh, the box and the... Wait, I did it?
[72:24.09]Oh, I did it.
[72:32.84]How do I put this away?
[72:36.98]How do I put this away?
[72:45.51]Get rid of one of the pistols.
[72:50.88]Alright, I got it.
[72:51.50]Nice.
[72:51.78]That was fucking easy.
[73:01.43]Fucking, like, rat in a maze.
[73:06.35]It's a collectible.
[73:07.13]Alright.
[73:07.59]Gravity room.
[73:14.32]Negative gravity fields provide temporary inverse mass calculation for improbable... I know what this music reminds me of.
[73:19.26]Okay, if you were to right now go to the app store, the Apple app store, and you were to type in like marble adventure game.
[73:29.01]This is every song that plays on like a marble get through the obstacle course iPad iPhone game.
[73:37.73]That's what it is.
[73:44.73]Mass... Okay, gravity, anti-gravity.
[73:48.61]Anti-mass physics are extremely experimental.
[73:50.42]Please enjoy this exhibit at your own risk.
[73:53.60]I got my gravity gun.
[73:57.16]So now what?
[73:59.02]Balloons deliver capable upward force.
[74:05.02]What?
[74:05.72]Oh, I'm making balloons.
[74:06.68]Do I have to, like...
[74:14.21]What just happened?
[74:18.71]What happened to my... Hold on, what just happened?
[74:28.16]Oh my god, I'm so sweaty.
[74:31.58]You farted?
[74:32.41]No, no, no, hold on.
[74:34.87]Dude, did you hear that?
[74:44.34]Give me one second.
[74:45.50]It sounded like my VR thing fucked up.
[74:46.88]Never mind.
[74:54.82]Let me see.
[74:55.24]You guys can still see, right?
[74:57.90]Okay.
[74:58.26]That was weird.
[75:00.56]Let me just drink some water.
[75:03.84]And coffee.
[75:04.42]I'm, okay.
[75:05.78]I'm forever in balance.
[75:06.94]I'm drinking a shitload of coffee and a shitload of water.
[75:09.75]So like the diuretic that the coffee is, is being outweighed by the water.
[75:14.31]Alright, I'm going back in.
[75:25.37]Can you guys even hear what I'm saying?
[75:29.27]Probably not.
[75:36.53]Where are your eyebrows?
[75:38.53]They're being squished.
[75:40.77]Where are your eyebrows?
[75:42.92]Oh, my hair.
[75:43.86]Oh, back into bone work.
[75:58.85]Oh, my God.
[75:59.25]This is probably so loud.
[75:59.99]I'm sorry.
[76:07.68]I just lost audio in my left ear.
[76:08.94]That was weird.
[76:12.66]Okay.
[76:14.24]What's going on there?
[76:14.92]Okay, audio is, like, leaving my left side of my head.
[76:22.11]Spin.
[76:22.35]Alright, so I have a balloon gun.
[76:28.21]Where is it?
[76:28.55]Over here.
[76:37.93]Do I just do it to myself?
[76:44.86]Is it gonna work?
[76:54.70]Come on, why is this not working?
[77:13.06]It's in every cartoon!
[77:32.53]Yeah, my headset's fucked up.
[77:36.76]Oh shit, this is actually broken.
[77:43.04]This chord is... Where does this go?
[77:51.46]Because I keep losing audio in my left ear when this chord is moved at all.
[78:02.23]What?
[78:05.32]Is the chord loose?
[78:08.54]That's what I was hearing.
[78:12.80]that sucks if that's the case let me see I just got this one oh it's it's plugged in yeah I'm losing audio in my left ear whatever it doesn't happen every all the time
[78:42.23]That sucks though.
[78:57.22]The index.
[79:00.04]Broken out of the box.
[79:07.57]I think that's better.
[79:15.48]Okay.
[79:17.02]Sounds like it's a... No, it's still happening.
[79:20.70]Fuck.
[79:21.70]I don't have audio in my left ear.
[79:24.20]Because when I tighten this is when it goes away.
[79:25.92]Oh, that's monumentally fucking disappointing.
[79:36.28]That's really disappointing.
[79:37.32]Oh, well.
[79:39.80]Alright, let's go.
[79:46.82]Check the connections at the tower.
[79:56.37]No, this is all plugged in good.
[80:03.19]Yeah, this is all good to go.
[80:04.11]Because if I put pressure on the cord up on my head, it cuts out and in and out.
[80:18.65]What are you saying?
[80:20.73]Hold on.
[80:25.63]Oh shit, really?
[80:27.81]Huh.
[80:47.21]That's a lot of messages.
[80:48.23]Alright, whatever.
[80:49.71]It doesn't happen that often.
[80:52.65]It's not a software fix if I can wiggle the cord.
[80:55.51]That's really fucking annoying.
[80:59.96]This shit's like a thousand bucks.
[81:02.00]Like, come on.
[81:05.00]I mean, I did like punch it a little.
[81:06.84]I like hit my face a little bit.
[81:10.04]Did I break it by like hitting my head?
[81:12.78]Like kind of a little bit?
[81:16.58]That's disappointing, but whatever.
[81:18.08]It's playable.
[81:19.48]Just disappointing.
[81:26.43]Sorry about that.
[81:27.07]Alright, let's go.
[81:32.75]It's playable, it's just annoying.
[81:34.75]Alright, so this is... Let me go like this.
[81:45.52]Oh, I gotta pull my pants up.
[81:47.56]No gravity.
[81:49.30]Do I have to make this thing move?
[81:53.56]How do I get these off my body?
[82:00.04]Can I get these off my arm?
[82:06.28]How do I get these off?
[82:13.04]Cut them off?
[82:14.74]Shoot them?
[82:15.44]I have to shoot them?
[82:22.26]Where's my stuff?
[82:28.99]Shoot more balloons and they'll go away.
[82:43.30]Oh, pretty sick.
[82:50.22]Oh, shit.
[82:50.82]Gotta go.
[82:55.23]No, but I don't want these on my arm.
[83:00.99]God damn it.
[83:02.35]How do I get rid of these?
[83:03.35]Alright, I got a plan.
[83:06.37]Wait, no I don't.
[83:07.07]Fuck it, let's go.
[83:20.35]Oh, shit.
[83:21.01]I'm... The fucking... Are the balloons keeping me up?
[83:28.15]Go down... Give me a... Fucking goddammit.
[83:44.60]What do I do?
[83:47.60]I can't...
[83:51.28]They're attached!
[83:53.76]How do I get out of here?
[83:58.61]Why is this happening?
[84:02.15]Let me go!
[84:05.20]Soft lock.
[84:05.90]Did I soft lock the game?
[84:34.37]No!
[84:34.85]Alright, how do I reset?
[84:36.31]How do I reset it?
[84:42.62]Burp Charlie!
[84:43.84]Eject?
[84:50.38]Punch them?
[84:51.78]Shoot them?
[84:52.14]I don't have a gun!
[84:59.72]Get off of me!
[85:06.43]Put more balloons?
[85:07.53]I can't, the gun's down there!
[85:11.15]Throw ammo at them.
[85:19.15]No, come back here!
[85:22.70]Oh, it works, it works, it works!
[85:23.76]That person's a genius.
[85:24.28]Okay.
[85:48.89]Go!
[86:03.16]Come here!
[86:09.61]Break it!
[86:11.53]What's this one fucking made out of?
[86:21.25]Come here.
[86:23.17]Wait, wait, wait.
[86:23.69]This is less.
[86:25.27]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[86:29.75]Why do I?
[86:30.15]Okay.
[86:42.73]I'm good.
[86:43.63]Why are the balloons still there?
[86:44.69]Shouldn't they be deleted?
[86:45.71]Alright, here's the gift shop.
[87:00.03]That's creepy.
[87:00.67]What does this one do?
[87:03.16]I don't like that.
[87:03.62]Get it off.
[87:17.83]Crystals?
[87:22.83]Ooh!
[87:26.17]Can I just steal this stuff?
[87:31.91]I'm just gonna walk out with it.
[87:39.98]What are they gonna do?
[87:45.60]Whatever.
[87:49.01]No, wait, I want a drink.
[87:59.58]Nevermind.
[88:03.56]Nevermind.
[88:11.60]Pick up that can.
[88:20.87]I want this.
[88:22.88]Never mind.
[88:27.88]Recycle.
[88:33.79]Ooh, garbage and recycling chamber.
[88:36.55]This is fun.
[88:38.08]Please, keep your workspace environment clean.
[88:51.09]Alright, I'm done.
[89:07.19]Was I supposed to do that?
[89:20.31]Tutorial complete.
[89:45.38]Mm.
[89:46.80]Okay, I'm in the trash.
[89:54.12]better alright let me get this situated better can't grab anything there's like a person
[90:30.80]Okay.
[90:32.58]Big city.
[90:34.76]Should I go that way?
[90:35.84]Okay.
[91:02.37]It was an audio again.
[91:08.39]I think, you know what I think it is?
[91:09.33]I think it's like the top of the court is like something happened to it.
[91:16.10]Like in here, like wherever the court sits.
[91:28.03]Oh my God.
[91:28.65]Oops, sorry.
[91:35.29]Are you guys hearing the audio cutout or is it just me that hears it?
[91:42.15]Oh, box.
[91:53.18]Oh, okay.
[91:54.84]Wait, can I break it with this?
[92:02.60]Was nothing in here?
[92:04.30]What?
[92:17.28]Tether ball.
[92:18.00]Cool.
[92:32.28]Now what?
[92:34.95]Tetherballs are the best?
[92:36.55]Yeah, I remember just sitting next to the tetherball.
[92:39.79]Everybody did this shit.
[92:42.33]You would be going around slowly, and you would just be, like, queuing up a fucking haymaker.
[92:47.05]And you were just gonna, like, crow hop, like, three times, and punch it as hard as you could.
[92:53.27]You know, those things need to come back.
[92:55.07]They were fun.
[92:59.61]Jerma seems not very enthralled by this game.
[93:01.73]Not really.
[93:02.11]I think it has to do too with the fact that I sometimes don't hear it in my left ear.
[93:13.07]Keep out.
[93:20.52]Oh, a brick!
[93:21.78]Two bricks.
[93:36.39]Get it off!
[93:40.12]I can't pull this off?
[93:41.24]Why not?
[93:45.58]I can't get it off?
[93:51.94]Okay.
[93:58.04]Why is the guy alive?
[94:12.62]Come on, let me Skyrim this guy!
[94:15.14]Alright, alright, wait, wait!
[94:27.45]Why'd he fuckin' die?!
[94:33.61]Alright, well, he's dead.
[94:52.06]Give me this.
[94:55.56]Can I?
[94:55.88]Wait, hold the other way.
[95:03.97]Get off there.
[95:13.54]Okay.
[95:17.10]This way.
[95:18.40]Can I go that way?
[95:27.29]Alright.
[95:31.65]That guy attacked us.
[95:39.52]District 6?
[95:45.64]I can't break that?
[95:47.32]With a hammer, I have to put a brick?
[95:50.04]Okay.
[95:54.78]Now, of course I've got to shoot the basketball.
[96:00.14]Not even close.
[96:02.54]Oh, free stuff.
[96:11.51]Alright, where are we now?
[96:17.17]Odd watchers skip.
[96:25.37]VR streamers skip might be actually what we do here.
[96:31.56]We've got 35 games.
[96:43.08]Skip it.
[96:43.86]I'm going to give it a little bit more time.
[96:47.25]I feel like we just kind of got into it.
[96:49.91]I'm not into it, though.
[96:51.49]It's not doing it for me.
[96:52.44]It just isn't.
[96:58.68]Alright.
[97:00.94]Okay, let me start attacking them.
[97:08.05]Let me try to just actually fight them.
[97:28.83]Never punched before.
[97:39.98]I think I just have to keep going.
[97:41.66]Can I jump over this?
[97:46.55]Get the hammer.
[97:49.37]Oh, I thought that was a gun.
[97:52.51]What is this for?
[97:59.10]Why can't I pick up this fucking satellite?
[98:00.82]Okay.
[98:10.50]Who is howling?
[98:11.42]Smash him with the satellite?
[98:13.53]Alright, let me see if I can hit him in the head with the satellite.
[98:15.23]Alright, come over here.
[98:17.55]Come here.
[98:19.05]Come here.
[98:22.09]Come here.
[98:23.41]You, come here.
[98:28.66]Can he not jump over here?
[98:34.26]Get the f- Why is this slow?
[98:39.35]Wait.
[98:39.75]What happened?
[98:44.48]Wait, what?
[98:47.36]Did I die?
[98:48.23]Oh, Bugleberry.
[98:55.71]I'm just gonna keep going.
[99:10.27]Alright, I need a general consensus from the people that are in chat right now.
[99:14.75]Should I continue to play Boneworks?
[99:18.21]Like, am I like, should I just keep going?
[99:21.15]Or, what do you think?
[99:25.67]Hey!
[99:25.83]This is a four hour game?
[99:27.21]Is it?
[99:47.57]I feel like it's longer than that.
[100:00.52]I'm fine.
[100:01.89]I knocked him over, we're good.
[100:09.83]That's not gonna shoot at me, right?
[100:14.55]Don't I have an inventory full of stuff?
[100:17.40]Yeah, I took a bunch of guns.
[100:19.64]Oh, come on.
[100:20.34]What?
[100:24.16]Employee promotion raffle.
[100:30.27]It's like 10 hours.
[100:33.91]It's cool, but I kind of feel like I'm just moving from portal room to portal room.
[100:40.67]I didn't think this was going to be a puzzle game.
[100:43.95]This is not what I thought it was going to be.
[100:56.12]The shooter part starts like now.
[100:57.34]That's why I kind of, I don't want to just leave immediately.
[101:01.99]I want to kind of see.
[101:02.69]Can I go in that door?
[101:10.80]Oh, it's a fake door.
[101:13.46]Alright, so I got to find the key, obviously.
[101:15.16]And the key is probably like over here.
[101:26.80]I thought I knocked it over.
[101:33.15]Guns in this game are fun.
[101:34.11]Yeah, I'm moving on.
[101:38.45]That was Boneworks.
[101:46.69]There's a button on the back of the gun?
[101:54.87]Yeah, alright, we're moving on.
[101:57.58]It's... This game's like 10 hours, and I kind of wish I didn't do the whole tutorial then.
[102:04.08]I feel like I'm invested at this point, which is unfortunate.
[102:07.76]Um... You literally stopped before it got interesting.
[102:17.97]I know, right?
[102:18.69]And that's like...
[102:27.28]Can I press this?
[102:34.30]What is he doing?
[102:37.00]Can I press the button, please?
[102:39.78]Get the fuck out of here!
[102:51.13]I learned this from Wrestling Empire, motherfucker!
[102:58.60]Come back to it another time.
[102:59.52]Alright.
[103:01.34]Yeah.
[103:06.12]We're moving on.
[103:07.20]It's like four different games.
[103:21.78]Tied to the tutorial.
[103:23.98]Alright.
[103:24.34]Boneworks.
[103:27.06]That was Boneworks.
[103:30.08]Now we're going to move on to one that I think I'm going to have a lot of fun with.
[103:35.62]That was a journalist?
[103:36.48]No, it's kind of boring.
[103:38.73]I have to be completely honest with you.
[103:40.71]I thought it was kind of boring.
[103:46.27]Tape the cable?
[103:52.60]It's better later on?
[103:53.48]Yeah.
[103:53.82]Yeah.
[104:01.24]It's a tutorial physics showcase and then the game.
[104:04.20]Because a lot of people don't get into Boneworks and a lot of people get very mad when people don't get into Boneworks.
[104:11.14]I mean, I... Look, with the knuckle controllers, that was fucking cool.
[104:16.11]I had a lot of fun to just jump around and throw things and shoot stuff.
[104:20.79]But it was... I mean, look, if it's a 10-hour game, I only stream for like 5 to 6 hours, I'm probably not going to do the whole thing.
[104:31.11]I hated this game at the start, but pushing through it ended up being kind of worth it.
[104:34.17]It does suck at the start, but that can't be, oh, oh well.
[104:40.30]That's alright.
[104:41.58]Maybe we'll come back to it.
[104:43.44]It was fun.
[104:44.34]I just, it was, I guess I was expecting something else somehow.
[104:47.40]I don't know why I went in, I don't know why I went in with an expectation that was.
[104:50.05]Alright, we're gonna move on.
[104:55.41]I turned the gun on.
[105:03.20]Alright, we're going to move on to... I want to play the baseball game.
[105:18.77]Okay, where's my library?
[105:24.65]Alright, let's get the energy up.
[105:30.85]Are you guys ready?
[105:33.88]Are you ready for more high energy?
[105:36.68]Weekly Meltdown?
[105:37.62]What?
[105:37.88]No.
[105:44.91]I do have to change this, but that's not what we're playing.
[105:52.47]Does this even have a fucking... I don't even... I'm not even sure this is on Steam.
[105:58.85]Or on Twitch.
[106:00.53]Oh yeah, it is.
[106:08.79]Alright.
[106:10.95]Almost ready.
[106:11.47]Let's go.
[106:12.79]Alright, time for high energy.
[106:13.41]You know what it was?
[106:14.23]I think that game just made me like low energy.
[106:15.67]I don't know what it did.
[106:16.71]I don't know why.
[106:17.79]It was just like...
[106:40.95]I was like, let's go!
[106:50.32]This chord is really tangled though.
[106:58.09]I blame the music, no.
[107:01.81]Are we gonna do some untangling?
[107:06.70]I just spit that all over myself.
[107:10.41]Alright, which way do I gotta turn?
[107:11.27]This way?
[107:11.45]Find out.
[107:11.73]I can't wait for this.
[107:12.79]This is gonna be fucking awesome.
[107:16.02]Alright, I really gotta be careful I don't actually hurt myself here because I'm gonna be fucking super into this.
[107:21.04]You ready?
[107:21.32]Alright, character.
[107:45.26]Whoa.
[107:47.90]Okay, head.
[107:52.50]I like that one.
[107:58.27]I don't think it really matters.
[108:04.75]Over that one.
[108:07.03]Face.
[108:11.76]Try that one.
[108:13.84]Body.
[108:18.34]That one's fine.
[108:25.43]Uh, this one's fine.
[108:26.61]What about, uh, can I make it brown?
[108:33.95]Facial hair?
[108:37.61]No?
[108:38.03]None?
[108:38.60]No, I'm not doing that.
[108:40.50]Alright, confirm.
[108:47.64]Alright, I gotta... I'm so excited.
[108:50.96]Here we go.
[108:55.04]Always hold both controllers when playing this game, okay?
[108:59.20]Are you... I'm right-handed.
[109:00.40]Choose your locomotion.
[109:03.29]Running.
[109:04.25]To move, hold down the buttons.
[109:07.27]I freaked out.
[109:07.81]I thought this was like a fucking local Vegas radio station.
[109:11.13]Hold down the buttons lighting up on your controller.
[109:15.39]And swing your... Whoa!
[109:19.47]Okay.
[109:23.78]I don't know if I really like that.
[109:29.26]That's too much.
[109:33.54]Walk by holding down the trackpad thumbstick.
[109:35.70]Okay, yeah, that's... Hold down bolt.
[109:38.37]Yeah, okay, that's much better.
[109:41.70]Some players have issues with locomotion, so we've given you an option to create a projection of your character when doing movement inputs.
[109:48.01]This will allow you to see your destination before teleporting there.
[109:52.69]Um, let's just go.
[109:53.77]Alright.
[109:56.49]Announcer?
[109:58.13]Practice.
[109:59.95]Pitching practice.
[110:01.19]I'm ready.
[110:05.59]Here we go.
[110:11.47]Can I... Oh, this is... Alright, this is going to be sick.
[110:20.07]You got a Mega Man hand?
[110:24.39]Ball.
[110:24.99]Do I... I don't have to actually throw it?
[110:26.17]Strike.
[110:31.97]Ooh.
[110:38.91]You actually have to catch the ball, too.
[110:42.49]Alright, this is cool.
[110:46.19]Do I have to actually catch the balls?
[110:50.08]Oh, wait a minute.
[110:50.78]Quick menu.
[110:51.38]Cannon?
[110:53.56]What?
[110:54.26]Oh, no, wait.
[110:55.06]Left?
[110:56.00]Can't... Oh my god.
[111:06.27]Give it to me!
[111:14.33]Fuck, this is so hard.
[111:20.14]And you actually... You actually have to grab, too.
[111:22.42]Oh my god, I'm gonna... Maybe I shouldn't do manual.
[111:29.85]Maybe it's gonna be too hard.
[111:42.89]There we go, alright.
[111:44.07]Just takes a little bit of getting used to.
[111:54.12]I'm gonna do that so often.
[111:55.84]Alright, I get it, I get it.
[111:56.86]I like it.
[112:01.62]Let's go, okay, now I wanna do hitting.
[112:05.28]I wanna do hitting tutorial.
[112:11.03]Batting practice.
[112:13.29]Dude, if this is- Okay, if this is as fun as I think it's gonna be... No fucking way.
[112:25.34]Are you kidding me?
[112:26.12]This is like Wii- This is everything I wanted from Wii Sports!
[112:37.05]Oh my god, it's like exact one-to-one!
[112:45.06]Shit!
[112:45.74]Where'd the bat go?
[112:52.42]Dammit!
[112:52.76]Okay, I'm swinging late.
[112:54.84]Swing early.
[113:00.10]Here we go, alright.
[113:00.96]I'm hitting the top of the ball.
[113:07.73]Oh, fuck!
[113:11.53]Stand back?
[113:12.09]Am I too close?
[113:17.02]Keep dropping the bat.
[113:25.80]Baseball is back.
[113:26.68]You keep bunting.
[113:27.44]I'm trying not to bunt.
[113:31.57]You gotta slow down.
[113:32.57]Alright.
[113:40.61]Alright, yeah.
[113:41.69]I gotta back it up like here.
[113:43.85]What is it doing?
[113:46.39]Get off.
[113:47.84]Fucking index!
[113:48.54]What are you doing?!
[113:49.16]Alright, one more.
[113:57.26]I gotta get under the ball more.
[113:59.12]I'm too far over it.
[114:04.75]Kill the batter.
[114:06.89]I mean... I have to get the ball in the air!
[114:20.46]This is such a good weakling!
[114:25.28]Alright, I- Why does every VR game have the same song that's looped on five seconds?
[114:33.03]I don't know.
[114:36.67]Wait, cannon?
[114:37.33]Alright, I got the hang of it.
[114:47.20]I'm ready.
[114:51.35]Okay, let's do it.
[114:52.34]Play ball!
[114:54.08]Easy against the sloths.
[114:54.88]I can't do anything else.
[114:56.04]How many innings?
[114:56.62]We'll start with three.
[114:57.98]I don't want to do nine innings.
[115:13.02]Welcome everyone to another fantastic game of Totally Baseball.

[116:37.91]I got a release like earlier.
[116:41.93]Oh my god, I can't... What happened?
[116:52.32]You actually field the balls.
[117:00.38]Can you hit the batter?
[117:03.80]Stop turn off throwing assist?
[117:05.15]Is that going to help me?
[117:19.09]What the fuck?

[117:22.51]I'm not... Turn it on.
[117:26.03]Oh, I thought you said turn it off.
[117:33.71]Do I have to actually run as the runner?
[117:43.05]That went fast.
[117:47.30]Fuck.

[118:47.27]Hurry up!
[118:47.91]Get it!
[118:48.15]I think I have to stand back a little more.
[119:00.13]Oh my god!
[119:15.44]I'm just gonna use the cannon.
[119:16.70]Fuck it.
[119:38.98]Okay.

[125:28.52]Can I?
[125:28.64]Let's see if I can turn it off.
[125:44.74]I don't think I can turn off the movement vignette.
[125:48.89]Don't break your back, I'm good.
[125:49.93]I'm well prepared.
[125:57.43]Don't ever look when you're running to first base, it's a huge mistake.

[129:00.26]I got it!
[129:01.20]Alright, I'm good.
[129:02.38]That's a ball.
[129:42.85]One-handed baseball?
[129:44.03]I mean, it's hard to do it.
[129:46.15]I'm doing better than I was last time.
[129:50.83]God damn it.
[129:55.36]No, I'm good.

[181:56.83]Let's do a different game.
[182:05.22]Alright, what else we got?
[182:09.54]There's Space Channel 5.
[182:10.72]I have so many games.
[182:15.22]Um... Oh no.
[182:22.04]I lost chat.
[182:26.22]Why did I lose chat?
[182:26.94]Space Channel 5, baby.
[182:39.97]Ready, Space Channel?
[182:45.03]What happened to chat?
[182:50.15]Hold on a minute.
[182:55.78]Hey, you guys aren't there anymore.
[182:56.66]Did the chat window close?
[183:03.54]No, it's here.
[183:07.42]Um, hold on.
[183:07.88]Alright, I'm gonna... Actually, you know what?
[183:11.01]I'm gonna take a break.

[183:12.85]Holy shit, I've been playing for three hours.
[183:13.85]Yeah, I'm gonna take a quick break.
[183:17.01]I'm gonna pee.
[183:17.79]Get some more water.
[183:18.83]And we'll come back with Space Channel.
[183:22.85]Either that or... Maybe I'll pick one.
[183:27.63]Right back.
[190:29.20]Oh, can you hear me?
[190:31.62]How are we doing?
[190:33.64]Good.
[190:40.00]So let's do thinking of the space channel.
[190:47.24]Dino extinction.
[190:58.42]Turn the compressor off.
[191:10.49]Is it too?
[191:10.93]Well, it's because I don't have the headset on right now.
[191:19.84]The headset's like resting over here.
[191:26.00]It's fine.
[191:26.54]Yeah, I think it looks alright.
[191:28.25]Alright, Space Channel.
[191:29.01]And then, you know what?
[191:29.79]Let's do Dino Extinction.
[191:31.17]I think I want to play that one.
[191:32.03]I'm going back here in a second.
[191:39.17]Getting back in.

[192:06.79]Alright, Dino Eruption is what we're going to play.
[192:13.97]Time Hacker was a solid experience.
[192:18.34]It was very, very much pleasantly supplied.
[192:21.60]I can't even talk.
[192:22.50]I can't even say words.
[192:23.66]VR just takes so much out of you.
[192:26.38]I have the LA Noire VR files.
[192:30.32]I got a lot of stuff.
[192:32.25]This is what we're doing for the... I'm streaming like three times this week.

[192:43.27]Probably Sunday.
[192:44.43]Or we're doing today and then like Saturday, Sunday.
[192:46.59]I haven't figured that out yet.
[192:49.01]But I'm going to stream three times.
[192:54.63]Did I lose the chat again?
[192:57.32]There it is.

[194:48.50]Alright, that looks good.
[194:55.32]Comfort options.
[194:57.30]No vignette.
[194:58.08]What's with the vignette?

[196:52.91]Press grip button to open menu.

[198:28.99]Swing, swing, swing, swing!
[198:30.25]Block, block, block, block!
[198:31.09]Cast magic!
[198:31.90]And then it cuts to like somebody zooming Cameron really close on a mountain and the guy's fucking basically leans in and he's fucking got wind in his hair!
[198:39.72]Reach behind your head and release... Alright, I'm just gonna... Oh...
[198:52.44]I just realized what was happening.
[198:54.43]I can't look out there.
[198:56.31]I can't look out that window.
[198:58.14]I can't look out that window.
[199:00.68]I can't look out that window.
[199:02.12]Oh my god.
[199:02.80]Ah, thank you for coming in.
[199:06.26]Time is unfortunately critical.
[199:07.94]This guy's proportions are strange.
[199:10.82]Press marked button to activate laser interactor.
[199:13.95]I don't know.
[199:17.55]I don't know what is... Press marked button to use laser interactor.
[199:21.85]I know you've not been on my security detail for long, but word has reached me of an impending threat to my family.
[199:29.83]I feel like I look like this guy.
[199:31.21]I kind of have like a small head and really long arms.
[199:36.21]Okay.
[199:37.33]My wife is the head of an exclusive facility that observes these creatures, some of which you see here displayed.
[199:44.36]Okay.
[199:46.64]A facility that you should be parachuting down to in approximately two minutes.
[199:51.42]That's a long time.
[199:53.04]Can we make it like 30 seconds?
[199:55.17]I have recently lost communication with my contacts there.
[199:58.10]An auspicious sign given what is coming.
[200:06.40]I can't pick up your chairs.
[200:08.50]Your mission is to find her.
[200:10.46]Dr. Layla Kessler.
[200:12.02]Protect her and get her to safety.
[200:14.44]You got it.
[200:17.20]And what will you be doing, sir?
[200:19.14]Er, sir?
[200:20.30]Are these dinosaurs?
[200:21.51]What's the threat?
[200:23.13]What's the threat?
[200:24.65]To put it concisely, I've received advanced reports of solar flares hitting the Earth.
[200:29.43]Okay.
[200:37.82]Normally, I'm told these things are not cause for worry, just flashing lights colliding with Earth's atmosphere.
[200:44.24]Mm-hmm.
[200:44.66]However, they do interfere with communications.
[200:47.60]They're like dinosaurs.
[200:50.04]Two minutes and 36 seconds.
[200:57.96]Okay.
[201:04.76]I guess we're waiting the two minutes before I can leave.
[201:23.55]The last report received stated they are getting vastly larger with a CME, a giant solar eruption, predicted.
[201:31.19]By now, it may have already happened.
[201:38.08]Okay.

[206:32.14]Laser detected.
[206:32.95]I have to jump out of that?

[206:41.08]Hold on.
[206:50.57]Do I even have a parachute?
[206:58.22]I don't think I have a parachute on.
[206:59.58]I'm just gonna jump out of the fucking plane?
[207:23.99]Was I supposed to do that?
[207:36.17]Whoa!
[207:36.72]I did... Turn around.
[207:39.28]What?

[208:05.46]Move controller to climb.
[208:07.74]What can I help you with?
[208:14.09]Oh shit.
[208:15.03]Oh man, I'm inside of it.
[208:28.00]What's going on?

[208:38.96]Press the marked button to equip bow.
[208:41.50]What the fuck?
[208:44.42]Why is there a T-Rex over here?
[208:46.66]What the fuck?
[208:50.06]Reach behind your shoulder and press the trigger button to grab an arrow.
[208:55.21]I think I just blew myself up with a grenade.
[208:57.39]Print?
[209:04.47]Um... Shit.
[209:11.59]Oh, did he ate it?
[209:13.39]He... Hold on.
[209:16.81]Heal... What do I need to do?
[209:18.33]I don't have any bow... I don't have any arrows.
[209:23.30]I don't have any arrows.
[209:24.40]Do you have any arrows?
[209:25.20]You're talking to me now?
[209:26.56]You were in a bit of a daze there.
[209:28.04]Figured I'd take you up to see the doc.
[209:32.77]There's a fucking dinosaur!
[209:36.09]So you're a rescue party?
[209:37.77]Where's the rest?
[209:38.39]Press right trigger button to respond.
[209:41.35]He's talking!
[209:43.71]It's the dinosaur talking.
[209:47.14]Thanks for the tutorial, T-Rex.
[209:49.02]I appreciate it, sonny.
[209:51.09]Dr. Kessler said we have it under control.
[209:53.11]Ha.
[209:53.71]But, oh, I don't know.
[209:55.02]A little something with giant teeth here tells me that might not be the whole story.
[209:58.66]Ha ha.
[209:59.28]Ha ha.
[210:03.54]Yeah.
[210:03.92]Anything else?
[210:10.21]I love this.
[210:11.43]Come on.
[210:12.01]Continue.
[210:13.71]Anyway, your little bow there is good for putting the smaller ones to sleep.
[210:17.31]But I doubt it's going to help against our big friend here.
[210:21.33]What do you mean?
[210:22.31]Can that T-Rex get to us?
[210:24.43]Where are your guns?
[210:29.30]Where are your guns, dude?
[210:31.60]Guns?
[210:32.64]Not here.
[210:33.56]It's an observation facility, not a hunting range.
[210:38.04]If we have to, we use state-of-the-art electrical shockers, force weapons, and... Force weapons.
[210:43.11]...tranquilizers like your little bow there fires.
[210:48.04]But I think this guy will need a bigger dosage than you got there.
[210:51.84]And why is he on- how did he get on this rock?
[210:53.54]Alright, I'll get- I'm- Oh shit, it's food!
[211:00.71]Does he have like a big steak?
[211:10.09]Come here.
[211:11.74]Come get a steak.
[211:17.59]That's so stupid.
[211:21.26]I can't print any more steaks?
[211:27.70]Where's the doctor?
[211:28.28]Actually, she's just up ahead of the backup generator facility.
[211:30.90]He's freaking me out.
[211:32.82]I was just admiring this guy.
[211:35.21]I heard you can distract him with a bit of food.
[211:37.31]Sure.
[211:37.85]He looks distracted.
[211:39.61]He's like, yes, you can.
[211:40.69]I'm very distractible by food.
[211:42.71]He's correct.
[211:44.99]What is he doing?
[211:49.55]Okay.
[211:49.93]I was going to make some with the generator there and feed it to him so we can get by without any worry.
[211:56.73]Shall I give it a go?
[212:02.49]Sure.
[212:03.95]Show me.
[212:06.38]Alright.
[212:07.18]Let's give this a go.
[212:10.98]Why are you walking like that?
[212:14.36]Why is he walking like this?
[212:19.06]Why would you ever get this close?
[212:23.02]Of course!
[212:29.39]His shoes!
[212:33.57]His shoes came off!
[212:37.05]His shoes came off!
[212:38.67]What?
[212:43.80]Reach behind your shoulder and press trigger button to grab an arrow.
[212:47.60]EAT THIS MOTHERFUCKER!
[212:53.04]These dinosaurs think they can roam the fucking Earth again?
[212:55.73]Not on my watch!
[213:04.45]So what, that guy's just go- can I- am I stuck here?
[213:10.45]I don't- I think I- I think the whole thing is fucked up because that guy is like oh my god everything about that was fucking amazing um can I get out of here?
[213:34.07]This is like the Disney rides and the Universal rides from like back in the 90s and the 80s where you could literally be going that way and King Kong is right there and you turn and King Kong is right here too.
[213:47.41]It's like, oh, there he is.
[213:49.29]King Kong, fucking scary.
[213:52.55]Oh, okay.
[213:56.13]Reach behind your shoulder and grab.
[214:01.19]I don't have any arrows.
[214:05.36]Where- I don't know where- where am I?
[214:11.01]Use laser to print.
[214:16.63]Okay.
[214:18.95]Oh shit, arrows.
[214:22.35]Um, did I get them?
[214:26.27]Thank you.
[214:26.75]Okay, what abouts in here?
[214:31.96]What the fuck is that?
[214:35.78]Why do I hear that?
[214:36.70]Can I get in?
[214:49.37]Is that the T-Rex making that noise?
[214:50.67]Oh, okay.
[215:05.58]Is that a bad guy?
[215:09.80]Jump!
[215:10.58]Jump!
[215:11.16]What happened?
[215:23.25]What happened?
[215:24.21]Why did that happen?
[215:34.17]I'm so confused.
[215:36.75]Hold on.
[215:41.06]Why would they be keeping it in there?
[215:47.72]What is that?
[215:50.09]Okay, I want the bow.
[215:51.71]No, put the... Give me, give me, give me, give me...
[216:01.31]Not this again.
[216:01.71]Oh, no.
[216:01.85]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[216:02.41]Dr. Kessler.
[216:05.03]Okay, she's just at the backup generator.
[216:07.33]What?
[216:07.43]I've gotten bigger somehow.
[216:08.87]Show me how to feed him again.
[216:10.29]Alright, let's give this a go.
[216:41.21]Don't do it!
[216:42.13]Don't do it!
[216:42.69]You're so much worth- your life is so much worth living for!
[216:53.66]Help!
[217:01.34]Press the marked button to equip bow.
[217:04.64]Why can I throw this shit?
[217:09.34]Alright, get me the fuck out of here!
[217:11.84]No, I'm getting out of here!
[217:13.64]I need- I wanna go down!
[217:27.01]Okay.
[217:27.89]So behind the backup generator is where I need to go.
[217:30.63]I'm ready to try that.
[217:31.97]Or attempt it.
[217:36.94]Okay, something exploded in here, and I don't know what the hell it was.
[217:41.90]I don't know.
[217:42.24]It was like a bomb.
[217:49.58]A fucking dinosaur.
[217:54.70]I'm not leaving this one yet.
[217:56.53]No fucking way.
[217:57.31]Not a chance.
[217:57.83]Okay, here we go.
[218:14.38]What the fuck?!

[218:34.24]Oh god, come on.
[218:35.18]Alright, well, whatever.
[218:36.00]I need to equip the bow.
[218:41.91]First of all, I gotta back up.
[218:43.17]I'm way too close.
[218:44.45]I also have to spin around.
[218:48.27]I'm so tangled.
[218:48.95]Alright, what does this do?
[218:55.74]Connect with laser.
[219:05.55]Let go.
[219:05.89]What did it do?
[219:08.53]Laser detected.
[219:12.56]I have no idea.
[219:13.02]Okay.
[219:19.36]There are dinosaurs here?
[219:23.32]Do I have to do anything with them?
[219:36.79]Why am I going up here?
[219:45.30]That was so pointless.
[219:46.54]For what?
[219:46.96]That- I could- Okay, I'm getting down.
[220:16.43]That hurt me that much?
[220:23.16]This ain't baseball?
[220:28.96]It's a petrotericitea.
[220:31.32]I feel like he can get out of here.
[220:40.30]What the fuck?
[220:43.09]It's an eagle.
[220:44.13]That's not...
[220:46.43]I want that.
[220:51.26]I want those.
[220:52.00]It's not even doing anything.
[221:18.16]Can I pet them?

[234:03.87]I'm gonna puke.
[234:05.19]I'm gonna puke.
[234:06.31]I'm gonna puke.
[234:07.45]I'm gonna puke.
[234:08.55]I'm gonna puke.
[234:19.75]Okay.
[234:28.39]Alright.
[234:28.63]Give me a sec.
[234:29.99]Can I even... Yeah, I gotta stop.
[234:41.41]In my view, the world, like, just got disconnected.
[234:46.10]And I almost just fucking instantly threw up.
[234:54.20]Oh my god, that was fucking funny.
[235:01.67]The audio, I know.
[235:02.73]I don't know.
[235:07.04]Ugh.
[235:09.76]Alright, so here's what we're gonna do.
[235:13.96]I'm gonna call it here, because, like, yeah, I'm actually starting to get, like, sick.
[235:16.28]I don't know what was about that game, but it did it.
[235:19.58]So, I'll be back here tomorrow.
[235:21.24]We're gonna continue to go through the VR catalog.
[235:24.34]Um...
[235:31.47]Why can you shoot the people with the bow and arrow?
[235:33.81]Why is it like Dark Souls?
[235:34.93]Why can you kill NPCs?
[235:41.74]Oh my god.
[235:43.68]So tomorrow, I think we're going to open with Space Channel 5.
[235:48.58]Then maybe we're going to do some L.A.
[235:50.86]Noire VR case files.
[235:52.96]And then we're going to do Sentenced, which is an Executioner game.
[235:56.89]I promise I have eyebrows.
[235:59.67]And we'll go from there.
[236:00.87]But, yeah.
[236:02.89]That's the end of that air check.
[236:06.30]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[236:12.30]How do I look?
[236:30.64]Sam and Max VR?
[236:35.14]Is that out?
[236:36.70]I didn't know that was even out.
[236:44.13]I'll get it.
[236:47.15]Fred from Scooby-Doo.
[236:51.17]Well, some of these games were really fun.
[236:54.13]Boneworks was cool.
[236:55.09]I don't know.
[236:55.57]It's kind of... It wasn't grabbing me.
[236:58.70]It wasn't grabbing me.
[237:01.36]The first, like, 15 to 20 minutes I was having, like, kind of a good time.
[237:04.38]But it was just, I don't know, maybe a little too slow for me.
[237:07.01]Or maybe, like, I really need to put, like, another few hours into it.
[237:10.51]But I've had a blast.
[237:14.03]Baseball game was fucking awesome.
[237:16.03]Time Hacker was hilarious.
[237:18.45]VR really is so much fun.
[237:21.79]But it just annihilates me.
[237:23.95]I just get so tired.
[237:26.08]So that's why we're going tomorrow.
[237:27.85]Let's take a shower, freshen up.
[237:29.77]I'll see you guys back here at the same time, 4 o'clock Pacific.
[237:31.99]See you guys soon.
[237:38.89]Can't hear me?
[237:39.45]I'm trying to lean in.
[237:40.25]So, see you tomorrow.
[237:51.56]Can I get the subs to come up?
[237:55.66]I can.
[237:56.24]Look at that.
[238:03.94]Scammed bet.
[238:04.68]Well, I couldn't do it.
[238:05.46]I didn't do it, obviously, right?
[238:13.44]I'm really disappointed that the... I don't know what happened to it, but I'm going to disconnect all the wires.
[238:21.33]That left ear thing is really disappointing.
[238:24.33]I really hope it's not just a bad cable or something.
[238:27.11]Because I have dinged it a few times.
[238:28.55]I have punched it a little bit, just like the left side.
[238:31.40]You saw me do it.
[238:33.94]But I don't think that should be enough to kill the left hearing in the headset.
[238:45.69]Update.
[238:45.93]Yeah, I'll do the firmware thing and see if that's a problem.
[238:56.38]I've smashed mine into a wall before.
[238:58.04]Yeah, these things are usually pretty hardy.
[239:01.64]My Vive fell off my head flying down into the ground.
[239:05.87]I have smashed that thing so many times.
[239:17.84]But I'll check the cables.
[239:20.04]I'll get the update.
[239:27.26]What's your opinion on VR Zorn?
[239:32.17]I've never done VR Zorn.
[239:34.35]I'm terrified to do it.
[239:35.19]And I talked about this on another VR stream.
[239:36.91]And I'll make it really, really clear again.
[239:40.45]VR porn is one of those things where anybody that you know that could possibly come to your house or that you possibly are around, you need to make sure that they're on vacation.
[239:52.21]Because being inside of this headset and being there
[239:55.92]And you have to be absolutely fucking certain that no one is going to show up.
[240:00.66]And I mean, like, if you know that, like, everybody in your household, like, is on vacation, FaceTime them to make sure that it's proven before you get in.
[240:09.98]Like, oh, just checking on this.
[240:10.95]Like, I'm going to FaceTime you, like, a mom and dad.
[240:13.75]Yeah, so, oh, like, show me around Italy.
[240:16.05]Okay, they're still in fucking Italy.
[240:18.15]There's no way they're going to come home.
[240:19.31]There's no way they're going to see me jerking off in my fucking VR headset.
[240:22.41]No possible way, right?
[240:26.18]It's so vulnerable in there.
[240:27.38]I wouldn't want to, no, I don't want to do that.
[240:30.62]Lock the door?
[240:32.80]No, but why is your door locked?
[240:37.98]Son, why is the door locked?
[240:41.81]By the way, how are you going to hear that?
[240:44.35]If somebody tries to come in your locked door, you're immersed in VR Zorn.
[240:47.99]How are you going to hear that?
[240:50.01]They're going to get like the fire department there because they're scared.
[240:52.54]They're going to break your door down and the fire department is going to see you in there.
[240:56.97]fucking fully nude in VR.
[240:59.45]No, everybody don't, you have to make sure that no one will ever be around.
[241:08.42]Like he accidentally locked himself in the door, in the room.
[241:10.52]Are you in there?
[241:11.28]Hello?
[241:12.98]Knock, knock, knock.
[241:14.18]Where are you?
[241:15.86]You're immersed completely.
[241:30.75]Your headsets are open ear?
[241:33.29]Well, it depends on how loud you're listening.
[241:36.25]Alright, I'm fucking out of here.
[241:40.77]I'm sorry.
[241:45.19]Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
[241:46.49]We'll open with Space Channel 5 tomorrow.
[241:48.61]See you guys later.
[241:50.28]Take care of yourselves.
[241:52.78]And goodbye.
[242:21.82]Thank you.
[242:56.71]you
