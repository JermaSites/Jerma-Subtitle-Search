[02:00.15]I forgot the dog.
[02:00.95]Where's the puppy?
[02:01.45]I forgot the dog.
[02:02.21]What do you mean the dog?
[02:03.11]Because the animal control said we couldn't.
[02:04.80]Did Dorothy go home?
[02:07.59]It's the shuffle font.
[02:10.05]Right.
[02:10.61]I've been in there for fucking four hours.
[02:13.29]I have a question.
[02:13.89]Was all that shit inside me talk because you were using the bathroom inside the shuffle font?
[02:21.20]All I'm going to tell you is I would take a bit 40 minutes for you.
[02:25.84]But congratulations.
[02:26.82]Congratulations to Orange Team.
[02:29.66]So excited.
[02:30.60]Thank you.
[02:31.96]And now, you are probably wondering, what is the grand prize?
[02:35.88]Jerma and I have been working pretty hard on this.
[02:38.74]We're both pretty excited.
[02:40.50]This is something, I mean, Jerma, what's this mean to you?
[02:44.34]At TwitchCon, we had a conversation.
[02:46.15]Yeah.
[02:46.83]And you would not believe how difficult it is to find people to do this thing.
[02:50.67]Yeah.
[02:51.27]And the thing that we're talking about doing, of course, is... Tennis!
[02:57.33]What?
[02:58.37]You guys want to play tennis with us?
[02:59.87]We're going to play tennis.
[03:01.15]We've been looking for partners because Jeremy and I got into it.
[03:06.71]And then we've been looking for tennis.
[03:08.78]Dude, I think we lost a country on this.
[03:12.66]Nothing that he just said was funny.
[03:15.40]I was just baffled by that the prize is tennis.
[03:19.88]Dude, so we figured if we put on this show, right, you guys are very adaptable and whatnot.
[03:24.07]It's similar skill set to tennis.
[03:26.31]Just to find tennis partners?
[03:27.75]Yeah.
[03:29.19]You could have asked me.
[03:30.11]I wouldn't have drank so much.
[03:32.21]You got the brain.
[03:32.93]You're fine.
[03:33.49]You'll be alright.
[03:34.33]You guys are down?
[03:35.50]Yeah, I mean, yeah, I guess, I mean, if that's the prize.
[03:37.46]There it is, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Doug and Jeremiah's Tennis Maniacs.
[03:43.05]Come on, Doug.
[03:44.19]Yeah, let's go.
[03:44.99]I can't get them off.
[03:45.97]Come on, Doug.
[03:46.87]Alright, come on, guys, let's go.
[03:48.49]We're playing tennis.
[03:49.77]Let's go.
[03:50.15]Come on, everybody, we're playing tennis.
[03:52.99]Let's go, everybody, let's move.
[03:58.49]Okay, okay, okay.
[04:01.97]So this is what we're working on, right?
[04:05.27]So I think you start up front, right?
[04:07.69]You start up front.
[04:08.63]I'll be back.
[04:09.59]Thank you, Dakota.
[04:10.79]This is what we've been working for.
[04:12.78]You guys ready?
[04:13.60]How many hours it lasts?
[04:16.50]That's right.
[04:17.26]Doug and Jarrah's Tennis Mania.
[04:23.84]Can you be quiet?
[04:24.52]We're starting to do Tennis Mania.
[04:26.22]Are you a ref?
[04:27.77]Of course he's a ref.
[04:28.57]What do you think he's dressed like?
[04:30.73]This is going to be a standard tennis game.
[04:34.31]Two versus two.
[04:35.71]Doubles tennis.
[04:36.63]I've never played!
[04:38.33]You need to maintain your level of professionalism.
[04:42.89]The entire field will be in play, considering that it is doubles.
[04:46.89]Doug and Jerma, you will be on the west side of the field.
[04:50.99]Ludwig and... Squeaks.
[04:54.78]S-Q-U-E-E-X.
[04:55.98]Squeaks.
[05:01.73]Did you come up with that name yourself?
[05:03.37]I did back in the day.
[05:04.61]Why?
[05:05.31]Because I had a squeaky voice, but now it's more ironic because my voice is so deep.
[05:08.39]Wouldn't you agree?
[05:10.24]Interesting.
[05:11.28]Ludwig and Squeaky Toy, you will be on the east side of the field.
[05:16.46]Because I've been standing here waiting for the past four and a half hours, we are running out of time.
[05:21.20]And as such, we will play an expedited round of tennis.
[05:24.12]It will be first to five points will be the victor.
[05:27.90]In addition.
[05:30.91]You'll pick it up.
[05:31.51]You'll get it.
[05:32.91]You guys were great at shuffle mania.
[05:35.57]It feels so relevant.
[05:37.25]Yeah.
[05:38.19]This is what it is.
[05:39.05]In addition, because we are not doing multiple sets, we will be deciding who is going to start the serve with a coin toss.
[05:45.47]Ooh, OK.
[05:46.27]That's you.
[05:46.68]That's all you.
[05:47.06]That's all you.
[05:47.62]Done.
[05:47.90]Always heads.
[05:48.26]Always heads.
[05:49.18]Oh, sales.
[05:49.74]Oh, sales.
[05:50.16]Sales never fails.
[05:51.26]That is a far toss.
[05:52.94]OK.
[05:54.56]It's heads.
[05:55.04]It's heads.
[05:55.38]It's heads.
[05:56.04]Nobody can see it from here.
[05:57.28]It's heads.
[05:58.51]Would you like to serve, or would you like to receive?
[06:00.89]Serve first.
[06:01.75]Serve first.
[06:02.31]Is this just an opportunity?
[06:04.43]You guys just stunt on us?
[06:07.15]It was tails, by the way.
[06:09.53]Oh!
[06:10.49]You pronounced heads incorrectly.
[06:11.83]Oh, sorry.
[06:13.01]It was heads.
[06:13.65]Players, get into position.

[06:50.15]I get one more.
[06:50.75]It's okay.
[06:51.65]We got one more.
[06:52.28]You get two chances at a serve.
[06:53.88]Have you guys ever played tennis?
[06:55.20]No.
[06:59.47]That's right, that's right, that's right.

[07:05.25]Alright, that's one for you guys.
[07:06.75]Let's go, let's go.

[07:16.62]Okay, that's fine.
[07:17.58]That's fine, that's fine.

[07:48.36]We're back in.
[07:48.90]No, it's our serve.
[07:50.92]We alternate serves.
[07:52.38]Have you never played tennis?
[07:53.36]No, we haven't.
[07:54.50]Unbelievable.
[07:55.60]Why did we do all of this then?
[07:58.20]That's fine.
[07:59.54]The ref said it's fine.
[08:01.25]No, I think you served.
[08:04.45]He said, what is it, my serve?
[08:05.89]We haven't played tennis.
[08:07.13]I won on my serve.
[08:09.05]OK, alright.
[08:11.41]Alright.
[08:12.19]Whoa.
[08:12.75]That is not legal, but I don't think they realize it now.
[08:15.69]What?
[08:16.03]OK, that was a fault.
[08:16.69]See, re-serve, re-serve.
[08:18.33]OK, OK.
[08:18.81]Did you play tennis?
[08:20.75]For like a few months in high school.
[08:25.34]OK, well, it's double time.
[08:27.64]It's double time.
[08:28.78]It's gotta be diagonal.
[08:31.14]It's gotta be diagonal.
[08:32.64]What?
[08:32.96]OK, I said the tennis I play.
[08:38.58]How many points do you need?
[08:40.02]First to five.
[08:40.56]No, you're on the wrong side.
[08:42.35]You've got to go over there, Squeaks.
[08:44.55]This side.
[08:44.85]You should have crossed.
[08:46.37]Alright, Jeremy, you're supposed to go.
[08:48.87]Have you never played tennis?
[08:50.13]No, I haven't played tennis.
[08:51.29]Squeaks, you've got to land it.
[08:53.81]Best box.
[08:54.41]It's on the wall.
[08:55.85]What?
[08:56.25]It was false.
[08:56.79]Rascal.
[08:57.55]You can't argue with the ref.
[08:59.09]The other player knows what he's talking about.
[09:01.47]Improper.
[09:01.91]Improper.
[09:05.19]Minus one, two to one.
[09:07.08]Minus one point for a penalty.
[09:08.56]Let's go.
[09:09.74]I know.
[09:10.85]Alright, light hit, baby, light hit.
[09:13.27]Look out, look out, look out.
[09:15.36]Oh, look out!
[09:16.16]Whoa!
[09:18.40]Oh, my gosh!
[09:19.92]You can't do that.
[09:21.01]That was fucking awesome.
[09:22.49]What are we doing?
[09:24.11]He's playing tennis!
[09:25.41]He used to play tennis, though!
[09:27.85]Oh, my God!
[09:28.97]That was hitting me in the face!
[09:46.97]That is what we've been working on.
[09:49.77]You've been working very hard.
[09:51.59]Oh, man.
[09:52.59]OK.
[09:53.23]What's the score, umpire?
[09:54.98]3-2.
[09:55.32]3-2.
[09:55.40]Because of the penalty.
[09:57.26]And also not have .

[09:58.60]Myself?
[09:58.90]Yeah.
[10:08.05]He fell right for that.
[10:10.06]There's bugs everywhere.
[10:11.60]Second attack.
[10:13.72]I almost hit the photographer out there.
[10:16.34]You still get one more, though.
[10:18.76]That's just a fault.
[10:19.36]I got two balls.
[10:20.91]Oh, was it?
[10:22.03]I'm trying to do what he did.
[10:24.01]It was cool.
[10:25.21]I haven't played tennis before.
[10:26.87]You clearly haven't played tennis, though.
[10:28.09]Yeah.
[10:30.77]Game point!
[10:32.31]Game point!

[11:05.92]That was me last.
[11:06.82]Oh, then you guys.

[11:12.98]It's been a while.
[11:13.68]I'm sweating so much.
[11:16.94]You're going to foul.
[11:18.52]This serve is scary.
[11:19.76]For game point.
[11:20.78]Alright.
[11:21.14]Double it.
[11:23.13]You know that baseball game you play against robots, and they did it like 500 miles per hour?

[12:13.71]How does this make you feel, winning such a prestigious and absolutely fair game with no missed calls?
[12:20.27]I want to thank my mom.
[12:21.32]There's been a lot of years that she said I would not be able to do this.
[12:24.90]I haven't even picked up a racket since high school.
[12:28.76]And I think a lot of my friends said I couldn't come back here and win at a tennis tournament, and I did.
[12:33.77]And it means the world to persevere through that and to make it here and have this trophy.
[12:39.53]And Jerma, I think I can just, I'm going to parrot what he said.
[12:45.54]Always, if that's the thing you're going for, the thing that you're trying to do, fucking do it.
[12:49.78]You know what I mean?
[12:50.82]Go for it.
[12:52.12]And hey, we're going to, we're going to go to Disney World, right?
[12:55.48]We're going to state.
[12:56.76]We're going to Disney World.
[12:58.45]This thing is sturdy.
[13:00.35]What the fuck is happening?
[13:03.09]Could the players suspect that we're in the tournament?
