[00:01.59]Hi guys.
[00:02.99]I didn't mean to press that button.
[00:04.29]Yes, I did.
[00:05.04]Of course you did.
[00:05.72]You can't make that joke again.
[00:08.02]Yes, hi.
[00:08.72]It's early.
[00:09.20]It's 3 o'clock in the afternoon Eastern Time.
[00:12.78]And I have noticed something very particular.
[00:16.00]The internet.
[00:17.30]We're green right now.
[00:18.56]So I'm just... Fuck it.
[00:20.56]We're turning it on.
[00:21.14]You know what I'm saying?
[00:22.62]I did a test for about two hours.
[00:24.58]I ran a stream test for two straight hours.
[00:28.03]And we got a green light here.
[00:29.59]There was only 40 dropped frames.
[00:33.22]So we're going... You use what you can use.
[00:36.98]You take what you can get, right?
[00:39.77]So give me one second.
[00:41.29]I want to do a tweet.
[00:42.01]And I'm going to change the title.
[00:44.15]I'll be right back.
[01:12.51]That title should have changed.
[01:15.11]If it didn't, please send a letter.
[01:20.40]To me.
[01:23.12]At 1-800- Jerma-985.
[01:27.00]Is that the amount of... Hold on, is that a good toll-free number?
[01:30.75]Could that be a toll-free number?
[01:31.71]Man, my fucking phone just died.
[01:37.03]What is it?
[01:38.31]How many digits is a toll-free number?
[01:40.06]1-800-
[01:42.30]Ba-ba-ba.
[01:43.82]Ba-ba-ba-ba.
[01:44.68]That's 1-800-J-E-R-M.
[01:47.72]J-E-R-M-A-9-8.
[01:49.52]Fuck.
[01:50.22]What if I get rid of the 1?
[01:51.92]No, that's not enough.
[01:57.62]Alright, so I can't tweet this.
[02:01.27]We're just all over the place here, folks.
[02:04.73]We're going to play L.A.
[02:05.47]Noire.
[02:05.69]We're going to try.
[02:06.57]As long as I can go.
[02:10.93]I can tweet it.
[02:12.96]Charge your phone.
[02:14.80]I know.
[02:16.22]I will.
[02:16.60]Hold on.
[02:16.98]Just... I need to write.
[02:18.24]I don't have any of my video stuff.
[02:22.78]I got the email today that said, Your stuff is en route to Las Vegas.
[02:28.42]Just biting my nails.
[02:30.60]Please don't have that.
[02:32.22]Please don't go over a bump.
[02:34.84]That 18-wheeler and... The back opens up and my... My fucking shit all falls out all over the highway.
[02:44.60]Now, I would get a call about that.
[02:45.70]That would happen to me.
[02:46.58]It really would.
[02:50.89]We're also going to try some stuff with the mic.
[02:54.49]Alright, let me just add this first.
[02:57.71]I was not prepared at all to press the button.
[02:59.61]But I saw green.
[03:00.59]And that green light means go.
[03:02.71]I can't waste any time today.
[03:03.92]Because we might get cut off here in a few hours.
[03:07.54]Give me one second.
[03:10.44]How's that sound?
[03:11.48]That's a good BRB, right?
[03:15.20]Alright, I'll be right back.

[04:38.97]This is so funny, so every single outlet is being used within 10 to 15 feet of my desk area here.
[04:47.21]I had to go walk across the room and plug it into the wall back here.
[04:50.61]Anyways, alright, let's go.
[04:54.83]Where's my webcam?
[04:57.08]Am I even gonna put this on?
[04:58.04]I don't know, I don't have time to put this on.
[05:03.66]I don't have time to put this on.
[05:04.78]Let's go like that.
[05:11.86]This is Ugly Day Part 2.
[05:15.82]Is my dress written down anywhere on my forehead or something?
[05:20.12]No.
[05:21.32]What?
[05:23.22]Why were we just over there?
[05:26.94]This doesn't make any sense.
[05:28.36]I don't want it like this.
[05:36.42]There's no difference.
[05:37.62]It's been one afternoon.
[05:39.66]Not even.
[05:42.48]That's fine.
[05:44.60]We're not even going to use this.
[05:45.50]I don't even know why I'm doing it.
[05:49.38]I'm not using this.
[05:50.56]I never play with face cam with games on.
[05:52.54]Don't you guys know?
[05:54.02]So, see you later.
[05:54.73]Alright, I got my phone now.
[06:00.07]My phone's ready.
[06:01.53]You guys want to watch me do a tweet?
[06:02.97]How about that?
[06:03.59]I'll give you that.
[06:05.23]I'll give you guys that, at least, right?
[06:08.81]Watch me.
[06:09.17]I'm going to pretend to be a baby over there, okay?
[06:13.15]You ready?
[06:13.45]This is what all babies do.
[06:16.88]This is a fucking performance art for you.
[06:27.15]They all sit like this.
[06:29.65]Like, in a V.
[06:55.15]Come on, load!
[06:56.51]Load, dammit!
[07:00.55]I can only do the baby for so long.
[07:12.15]Stop doing the- Just tweet it!
[07:14.57]Oh, LA Noire.
[07:18.56]La La Noire.
[07:30.10]I have to be over here because all my outlets are- everything's plugged in over there.
[07:32.74]I have that stupid card table set up.
[07:40.65]Alright, there we go, I tweeted it.
[07:41.97]Is that my- is that the right address?
[07:45.79]Alright, let's go.
[07:50.19]He's- he's a man, baby.
[07:55.47]What- what the fuck is happening?
[07:59.42]Oh yeah, look it.
[08:00.28]Remember when he sat like a baby?
[08:01.90]Alright, let's go.
[08:13.21]Somebody pick me up off the floor.
[08:14.75]Yeah, then when you get picked up, you go like this.
[08:16.49]You go like... Hold on.
[08:19.41]Wait, wait, wait.
[08:21.75]I'm sitting on the floor.
[08:37.95]That's how a baby gets picked up.
[08:40.61]Alright, I'm outta here.
[08:44.49]Let's play L.A.
[08:45.07]Noire.
[08:49.71]This is a TV-only chat.
[08:56.26]I've never played L.A.
[08:57.08]Noire.
[08:57.36]I have no idea what this game is.
[08:59.40]I mean, I know what it is.
[09:03.18]Did I fix the router?
[09:04.08]I have not fixed the router.
[09:07.49]I've been running a test through Twitch for the last two hours.
[09:13.79]And it's been green, so I gotta turn it on.
[09:16.83]I'm hoping we can get a good at least two or three hours of L.A.
[09:19.27]Noire.
[09:22.17]This is why I don't want the webcam on.
[09:24.03]I'm gonna show it to you one last time.
[09:27.87]I can't have headphones on my head.
[09:32.35]I can't do it.
[09:32.94]It's not gonna happen.
[09:34.44]I've tried, and it makes me feel sick.
[09:38.39]Wait, wait, wait.
[09:39.13]I want to test something.
[09:40.07]Let's test this first before we get started.
[09:42.77]I know, like the master of stalling starting games.
[09:45.29]I'm sorry.
[09:45.81]Just give me one second.
[09:47.99]Let's see if I can make this sound better.
[09:51.99]Noise suppression.
[09:53.19]Here we go.
[09:53.69]Ready?
[09:56.27]How do I sound?
[09:58.02]Do I sound worse?
[10:01.14]How about now?
[10:04.73]Is it better?
[10:06.99]You tell me, better?
[10:08.31]Better or worse?
[10:11.66]Actually, I gotta get this correct with you guys.
[10:16.40]So... Starting from the clap.
[10:21.12]How does it sound from here now, after that clap?
[10:23.02]Does it sound good?
[10:25.67]Should I change it?
[10:27.19]Does this sound good?
[10:28.07]Good.
[10:31.04]Better.
[10:31.40]Okay, hold on a second.
[10:32.40]Better.
[10:32.66]Great, great, great.
[10:33.66]Okay.
[10:35.26]One last test.
[10:37.56]Is this any different?
[10:39.74]From the clap on forward.
[10:43.24]Before?
[10:44.78]Or now?
[10:55.10]Don't knock the fucking TV over again.
[10:58.62]They sound exactly the same.
[11:05.18]Alright, but the static is gone now.
[11:06.98]That's all I care about.
[11:08.64]Alright.
[11:10.88]It's great.
[11:11.40]Play the game.
[11:12.18]Okay.
[11:12.52]But you know, one other thing.
[11:13.50]I was at the store today.
[11:19.05]Who even eats Sun Chips?
[11:21.35]Who even eats them?
[11:22.33]They sit in the bottom of the bag.
[11:23.55]You get the big bag that has the Lay's, the Sun Chips, the Doritos, and nobody ever eats the Sun Chips.
[11:28.99]Why even put them in the bag anymore?
[11:30.65]It's wasting space.
[11:35.87]And look, Chester Cheeto is such a weird character, isn't he?
[11:38.87]He's naked.
[11:40.80]Why are all these characters naked?
[11:42.26]The Trix rabbit's naked.
[11:44.90]Do we have to have all these naked mascots selling food to children?
[11:48.90]I don't understand.
[12:02.91]Welcome to L.A.
[12:03.59]Noire.
[12:06.25]What?
[12:12.05]Oh, okay.
[12:13.47]What if I couldn't do it?
[12:15.38]Wait, I should add a compressor to this too.
[12:16.82]Hold on a second.
[12:17.54]You know, just wait.
[12:20.76]This is just, this is not even the opening cutscene.
[12:23.82]I have to do a scream test here.
[12:25.60]Add compressor.
[12:30.18]More stalling.
[12:31.77]He's stalling again.
[12:33.39]And another thing.
[12:37.88]I think that... Wait, hold on.
[12:38.72]Let me test that.
[12:39.34]When I go up high... And another thing!
[12:41.93]That's not peaking anymore, is it?
[12:45.25]And one more thing!
[12:47.11]Because without it... And one more thing!
[12:50.15]That's better.
[12:50.91]Okay, keep it on.
[12:51.50]Alright, now we just improved the audio quality by like ten times.
[12:58.28]Let's go.
[12:58.54]Hit new.
[13:05.10]I'm ready for this.
[13:06.34]Everyone's been talking about this game for like three decades.
[13:08.60]This is the facial animation game.
[13:10.22]This is like the rotoscoped face video game.
[13:12.24]Shut up, Jeremy.
[13:12.85]Subtitles, I'll turn it on.
[13:36.13]The city where a man's home is his castle.
[13:38.91]A quarter acre of the dream made possible by victory.
[13:41.69]The city of opportunists.
[13:42.53]The city of dreams.
[13:43.25]Where Hollywood will shape the thoughts and desires of the entire planet.
[14:05.55]City of pioneers Red Dead 2 So is this a is this a you see game never know that I'm gonna know what I mean by that the city of dreamers You say oh You say come over here.
[14:30.20]Come over here little boy.
[14:30.88]You say I want to tell you something Is it one of those games?
[14:33.18]I hope it is
[14:35.84]A city of undercurrents.
[14:37.50]Yeah?
[14:37.78]Where not everything is as it seems.
[14:42.20]Kinda.
[14:42.84]Cool.
[14:45.14]A 20th century city that will become a model for the world.
[14:48.21]That's Steve Bloom, by the way.
[14:49.19]Steve Bloom.
[14:55.09]A city that has no boundaries.
[14:58.17]That will stretch as far as the eye can see.
[15:03.25]It might.
[15:03.55]I don't know.
[15:03.95]It might be.
[15:06.75]I'm going to turn on subtitles.
[15:07.79]Upon reflection.
[15:11.95]In Marine Corps, you deal with the chain of command.
[15:14.47]Mistakes get made, but you deal with them.
[15:16.72]You know what you're fighting for and that you're on the same team.
[15:18.98]But dealing with corruption is like chasing shadows.
[15:23.42]You never know whether the guy you're talking to is on the pad or whether it's your partner or maybe even the watch command.
[15:29.36]Is this an open world game?
[15:30.38]So who do you trust, Colm?
[15:32.70]I made up my mind a long time ago.
[15:35.68]Can't wait to see the information.
[15:37.02]Go ahead, KGPL.
[15:37.58]Roger, 14 Adam in route.
[15:40.61]You can drive in this game.
[15:42.39]Best game.
[15:42.65]Already gets an A-, it's at an A- already.
[16:05.11]Why am I green?
[16:09.88]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[16:11.14]Why am I like the Toxic Avenger?
[16:14.30]Why am I the Joker in the fucking Dark Knight?
[16:18.84]This was the whole plan?
[16:20.36]Alright, turn that off.
[16:30.21]Nope, okay, never mind.
[16:34.28]This is what we dress up as a police officer.
[16:35.98]We go through the big heights you see.
[16:38.12]I'll distract this dumb jolly guy in the front here and you go around the back and pick up the briefcase of money you see.
[16:49.78]Witness says a tall white guy, our shooter, put two in the Vic's head and then threw his piece.
[16:55.31]I need you guys to try and recover the gat.
[16:57.41]You want us to look anywhere in particular?
[16:59.09]Give it your best shot, guys.
[17:01.05]The dead guy's a low life.
[17:02.78]I'm not expecting any miracles here.
[17:04.54]And if we recover the weapon?
[17:06.02]Bag it and return it to technical services.
[17:08.10]Hurry it up, Floyd.
[17:09.10]We've got places to be.
[17:10.62]Happy hunting.
[17:12.18]Doesn't this game cost like 600 trillion dollars or something?
[17:15.72]That's why they can't do it ever again.
[17:17.26]This is a fist hump.
[17:19.04]Just going through the motion.
[17:20.54]Alright, hold on, hold on.
[17:21.64]This is one of the things about this studio, right?
[17:24.62]It cost them like 500 billion dollars to make this.
[17:27.68]So they could never do it ever again.
[17:29.40]They used all their resources to make this one game.
[17:37.64]Oh, look at the stalling.
[17:39.80]Photo mode.
[17:42.47]Sure- no, subtitles on. Display camera shake off, get that out of here.
[17:51.00]I'm turning the subtitles on everybody just relax. Alright.
[18:00.00]Probably right. Let's just get it over and done. Alright, have it your way. We'll search right up to the back wall, if you still don't come up with anything come find me.
[18:09.00]Turn off the camera.
[18:11.64]Two heads are always better than one.
[18:14.00]Press and hold- oh you can do this too.
[18:16.00]Am I holding a candle? No, it's a flashlight.
[18:21.00]Square is advice. Music will fade down to indicate that all clues have been discovered.
[18:26.00]Musical chimes, wireless controller vibration or a magnifying glass icon will be used to indicate objects that- you're going too fast!
[18:31.00]Clue indicators will set you in your investigation while switching them off will add to the level of challenge. The music is going to tell me when to stop playing?
[18:45.27]We got a bottle.
[18:51.45]It's an old bottle of Tabasco.
[18:55.53]That's all you need.
[18:56.87]That's all you need, guys.
[18:57.69]Don't put any more than that.
[18:59.24]Some of you fucking psychos put way more Tabasco on your eggs.
[19:03.52]That's all you need.
[19:04.72]Don't fucking do any more than that.
[19:07.56]You'll piss me off.
[19:08.28]Hold on.
[19:11.36]Shrink says the mind is the final frontier.
[19:18.45]Newspapers provide backstory on events which may or may not be related to your current investigation.
[19:21.74]There's ecstasy in the story behind the headline.
[19:24.40]Oh, that's cool.
[19:28.83]Dr. Fontaine.
[19:31.22]Could I have a word?
[19:32.32]Of course, young man.
[19:33.52]I really enjoyed your lecture, Doctor.
[19:35.77]Psychiatry seems to have a tremendous amount to offer.
[19:38.83]Why, thank you.
[19:40.13]I'm always happy to receive acknowledgement for my work.
[19:43.89]The mind is the last great mystery in medicine.
[19:47.17]I've never played this, no.
[19:48.25]Are you thinking of specializing, Mr... Sheldon.
[19:52.03]Courtney Sheldon.
[19:53.85]I'm only in second year, Doctor.
[19:56.13]I was going to make a big bang joke here, but somebody already did.
[20:01.45]That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
[20:04.28]See, that's the problem with... Hold on, we'll talk about this in a second.
[20:08.40]Can it be helped?
[20:09.36]I would say yes, given the right set of circumstances.
[20:13.98]Trauma forces the mind to close down, retreat in on itself.
[20:18.61]We try to find ways to unlock the mind again through a combination of therapy and drug treatment.
[20:26.80]This is what people look like in dreams when I have dreams.
[20:32.32]These are dream people.
[20:33.56]This is what they look like in their facial expressions and the way that they look and talk.
[20:36.38]You went through a lot together.
[20:40.76]Yes, Doc.
[20:45.25]This is a dream.
[20:45.73]Is it ever.
[21:03.94]I can't thank you enough.
[21:05.29]I'm not promising a cure, Courtney.
[21:07.69]I want you to remember that.
[21:09.99]Every physician has patients that he cannot hope to cure, for whom he can only smooth the path to death.
[21:20.79]So here's the issue I was going to bring up to you guys.
[21:25.45]When I play games that are five to ten years old, and you've seen somebody play through these, probably like six or seven other people before landing on this stream, right?
[21:35.70]I'm going to make references, and I'm going to say things that I think are really funny, but you've probably heard them eight times.
[21:43.52]That's the price that we pay for playing L.A.
[21:46.09]Noire like six years late.
[21:50.78]So I gotta be selective.
[21:51.58]I gotta be very careful and selective with the comedy routines that I want to put on for this stream.
[21:57.80]Because, like... Fucking Grillmaster X BBQ might have already made them.
[22:04.75]That's good.
[22:05.07]No, no, don't do it again.
[22:07.53]No, put it down.
[22:09.11]How do I put the paper down?
[22:14.04]Can I skip this?
[22:14.54]I can't skip this.
[22:15.94]No.
[22:16.10]No, don't share the fucking- I just took a screenshot.
[22:20.17]I can't skip it.
[22:20.79]No.
[22:21.05]Wait, is there like- Should I just quit?
[22:40.89]I'm gonna quit and come back in.
[22:43.23]No, I can't skip the opening cutscene either.
[22:44.86]Oh my god, why did I do that?
[22:45.80]Why is it even possible that I can do that?
[22:54.89]Skip cutscene button.
[22:55.91]There is none.
[22:58.70]Nothing skips this.
[23:01.52]Hold a button.
[23:02.12]Holding circle.
[23:03.36]Holding right trigger, left trigger.
[23:04.72]Hold O. I'm holding O right now.
[23:06.38]Skip it.
[23:06.60]I can't.
[23:15.70]Now he's stalling again.
[23:19.87]No, I'm not stalling.
[23:20.99]I'm trying to get out of here.
[23:22.15]Hey, you know what this looks like to me?
[23:25.47]It looks like everyone's in a dream.
[23:26.85]These look like dream people.
[23:28.17]I feel like when I have a dream, this is what it looks like.
[23:30.13]It's like he's wandering around.
[23:33.11]Yes, Doc.
[23:41.94]Give me his details and I'll make a prognosis.
[23:45.68]I left and came back and didn't miss anything.
[23:47.98]Your penance for your friend's help is to come and work at one of them in your spare time.
[23:54.74]Come on, Rockstar is such a quadrillion dollar company.
[24:00.02]If I already saw the cutscene and I can't just not see it again?
[24:02.30]Like if I click X?
[24:04.32]I want you to remember that.
[24:06.60]Every physician has patience that he cannot help but kill.
[24:09.81]I'm holding triangle, it's not working.
[24:11.53]Holding X now works.
[24:15.29]It actually worked.
[24:15.83]Okay, that person was right.
[24:17.56]You have to hold X. Why is that not on the screen?
[24:26.08]I did every button but that.
[24:28.72]Is there a cutscene with the fucking milk?
[24:31.18]Alright, put this down.
[24:36.91]One of the 13 newspapers collected.
[24:38.61]Ever.
[24:43.67]That was the first thing you tried?
[24:45.15]I mean, I was pressing X. I wasn't holding X for 5 to 10 seconds.
[24:53.41]What about the other bottle?
[24:54.50]Should I pick this up too?
[24:57.20]Am I just wasting time right now?
[25:01.36]I need... Look, we don't have very much time.
[25:02.84]My internet's going to turn off in like fucking 45 minutes.
[25:05.22]I need to... We need to see something.
[25:06.81]Let's go.
[25:11.07]Blood on the door.
[25:13.23]Nobody else can read this.
[25:14.11]You know what I mean?
[25:15.39]I'm sure there's some kind of lore or newspaper over there.
[25:17.23]Just look it up on YouTube.
[25:18.05]Look up newspaper clipping 2.
[25:20.07]If you want to see it.
[25:29.60]New clue.
[25:30.84]Shooter put him up against the wall and blew his brains out.
[25:33.53]Yuck.
[25:34.37]Hell of a way to go.
[25:36.07]Inspect an area.
[25:37.17]Doesn't really matter how you go once you're gone.
[25:40.60]Crash can.
[25:41.82]It's probably a weapon in the trash.
[25:46.00]There's somebody here.
[25:47.30]Somebody right here.
[25:48.88]Perpetrator's still here.
[25:49.68]I'm sorry.
[25:53.20]I'm sorry.
[25:53.79]I'm sorry.
[25:54.63]I'm sorry.
[25:55.61]Open the notebook.
[25:57.19]Clues.
[26:00.28]Use swipe.
[26:01.24]You can do this.
[26:03.60]Okay.
[26:05.24]Scooter Payton.
[26:06.74]Person's venture is listed by name.
[26:08.00]Murder suspect, Detective Floyd Rose.
[26:13.13]Okay.
[26:13.49]Bloodstain.
[26:16.11]Bloodstain crime scene.
[26:16.89]Blood splatter stains in recessed doorway on alleyway floor.
[26:23.13]That's easy enough.
[26:25.75]Okay.
[26:27.94]Clues.
[26:28.34]There they are.
[26:28.92]Let's get out of here.
[26:32.56]Need more clues.
[26:36.66]Advice?
[26:37.92]Have a good look around.
[26:38.92]It could be anywhere.
[26:39.93]Alright, what about inside the shoeboxes?
[26:44.45]Nope.
[26:45.03]No, nothing in the shoeboxes.
[26:48.21]Nothing in the Half-Life 2 crates.
[26:50.15]I mean, there might be ammo in there.
[26:52.49]Or, um, shields.
[26:54.83]Shut up, you laughed at that.
[26:56.11]Somebody did.
[26:57.85]One of you did, and I don't even care.
[26:58.97]All I care about is one.
[27:05.91]Should I get in the dumpster?
[27:07.19]No.
[27:12.12]Is there anything else I can do over here?
[27:13.08]I should've just... I would've just been looking at that.
[27:16.10]Look at that big... I didn't even do that.
[27:20.10]Ralph, there's something on the rooftop.
[27:22.52]How the hell did you see that?
[27:24.97]Reflection in the window.
[27:26.55]Looks like it might be our weapon.
[27:27.73]I'm gonna see if I can find a way up there.
[27:29.65]On the roof?
[27:30.23]Alright, don't hurt yourself.
[27:32.65]If it was reflecting, wouldn't it be on the ground?
[27:34.67]Alright, get up on the roof.
[27:40.80]Okay, go that way.
[27:41.62]There's gonna be some kind of weird ladder or something.
[27:44.22]The gun's up on the roof, right?
[27:46.00]No, I don't want to look under the bottle.
[27:49.92]Leave it.
[27:55.36]Alright.
[27:56.18]We got like a ladder system anywhere?
[28:00.18]No, I broke something.
[28:04.38]I just manipulated the crime scene.
[28:10.98]Come on.
[28:11.40]Ladder?
[28:13.42]I'm not picking up any more bottles, guys.
[28:15.26]No.
[28:16.60]Oh, there's a bed.
[28:18.14]Should I wait like two hours?
[28:19.23]Or sleep like three hours?
[28:20.85]Does that mean I can level up?
[28:23.01]All I know is Skyrim.
[28:24.35]I don't know anything else.
[28:27.26]Oh, there it is.
[28:29.96]That's not even Skyrim.
[28:30.81]I've never even played Skyrim.
[28:32.41]I played Oblivion.
[28:35.57]What do we got?
[28:37.33]We got a gun here.
[28:41.75]Why wouldn't I put on gloves for this?
[28:47.78]Shoot gun!
[28:49.10]Use L to manipulate an object and search for points of interest.
[28:53.04]Hold when the camera zooms slightly to allow it to zoom in.
[28:58.56]Smith & Wesson, serial S71893.
[29:03.80]Smith & Wesson.
[29:06.30]Okay, let's keep looking at it.
[29:09.51]Two rounds fired, and instead of dropping it down a drain, our shooter hoists it up here.
[29:14.87]Interesting guy.
[29:15.43]He probably threw it.
[29:16.13]You know what I'm saying?
[29:20.67]He probably threw it.
[29:26.47]we should follow up on this now before the perp tries to leave town investigation music stops but what about this is there a jump come on there's no fall damage in this game right I can't just like leap off the gun cole let's take it back to central we could get a commendation
[29:49.30]Could show some initiative, Ralph, and see if we can come up with an owner.
[29:52.30]That's a long shot, Cole.
[29:53.66]Mike makes me cringe, and this is boring.
[29:56.14]You know a local gun store?
[29:57.28]Sure.
[29:58.30]There's a place a couple of blocks from here.
[30:14.34]What do you want me to do?
[30:20.38]That's all I got.
[30:21.41]This is all I got, man.
[30:24.35]Until October 6th.
[30:30.43]What are we waiting for?
[30:31.83]Stop stalling.
[30:32.57]I'm not stalling.
[30:33.30]I'm just proving that I don't have anything here.
[30:36.42]I swear to God, some of you guys think that this is an elaborate prank, and I'm not moving.
[30:47.59]I gotta open the notebook.
[30:54.87]uh case objectives investigate the gun store okay can I do I drive to the gun store can be set as a destination guns and ammunition sales downtown outlet yes are you sure about this it's not really our gig
[31:17.32]No harm in doing some digging.
[31:19.26]Yeah, it's because the other one's currently in the back of a van somewhere.
[31:23.01]In, like, fucking New York right now.
[31:24.19]Alright, let's hurry up.
[31:25.11]Like, you don't walk to a car, you run.
[31:54.33]There's no other player damage, right?
[31:59.13]This is a Rockstar game.
[32:02.73]This is not possible in this game.
[32:05.73]No, it's not.
[32:07.19]They're like the fish in Call of Duty.
[32:14.33]What?
[32:14.47]Can you go through the windshield?
[32:19.51]Why do I want to know that?
[32:28.75]causing them harm is unacceptable conduct will severely impact your end of whoa whoa whoa hold on this consequences for doing this okay hold on I don't want any consequences I'm just gonna drive there
[32:46.80]Because there's an actual case report at the end that the Bureau gets angry with you.
[32:53.24]I can crash cars.
[32:54.83]That's fine.
[32:55.35]This stuff is made out of plastic in video games.
[32:57.09]It doesn't matter.
[32:58.17]But I can't run into people.
[33:09.64]Is there a handbrake?
[33:12.64]I don't think so.
[33:13.94]Can I just dive out?
[33:15.22]Can I bail out of the car?
[33:18.76]No.
[33:20.02]For the best.
[33:20.46]Okay, you can't hit people.
[33:23.08]You can't.
[33:25.99]That was a taxpayer!
[33:27.97]You just ran over a taxpayer!
[33:29.31]Sorry.
[33:47.46]So what next?
[33:47.98]Gold-handled doors allow you to enter.
[33:49.44]I have a word with the owner.
[33:51.08]This is where it begins, right?
[33:52.32]I have to go... Hey!
[33:54.77]Can you tell us anything about this gun?
[33:56.55]Smith & Wesson.
[33:57.81]Model 27, registered Magnum.
[34:00.19]Immediately go, why did you shoot that guy?
[34:02.31]Nickel-plated with pearl grips.
[34:04.49]Same gun used by General Patton.
[34:06.99]You're not suggesting he's the owner?
[34:09.20]No, I'm not.
[34:10.46]You seem to know a lot about the weapon.
[34:12.04]I ought to.
[34:12.98]I sold it.
[34:14.32]You know this piece will stop a rhino.
[34:17.13]These babies are only available special order.
[34:20.75]Here's my Smith & Wesson order book.
[34:22.93]You mind if I take a look?
[34:24.00]You're my guest.
[34:25.62]Let's see who did it.
[34:26.18]This is about something bad, right?
[34:30.12]Orders.
[34:34.90]Hmm.
[34:36.41]Yes, it's a visit book somewhere.
[34:38.73]I think it's in here.
[34:40.53]Model 27 with pearl grips, Cole.
[34:43.33]You see it on there?
[34:44.15]Model 27 with pearl grips.
[34:47.43]Okay.
[34:49.85]Uh, that's, we need 27.
[34:51.79]Wait, this is good.
[34:53.09]27, we need pearl, that's a walnut grip.
[34:58.89]27, we got pearl grip right here.
[35:02.03]This dude right here.
[35:06.85]We're in luck.
[35:07.61]Errol Schroeder.
[35:09.18]203 South Gless Street.
[35:10.72]Ordered the gun in February 46.
[35:12.16]Okay.
[35:13.96]Mr. Schroeder.
[35:14.76]Thanks, you've been a big help.
[35:15.94]Anytime.
[35:17.61]Always happy to help out the LAPD.
[35:24.34]Anything else in here?
[35:27.10]He's got like some duck phones.
[35:33.48]I doubt it.
[35:34.96]I doubt what?
[35:39.49]How do I put it down?
[35:43.06]Not all objects are relevant to your investigation.
[35:44.94]Yes.
[35:45.04]How do I put this down?
[35:46.58]Oh, there we go.
[35:47.04]Circle.
[35:47.60]Stupid.
[35:50.80]Sit in the hallway.
[35:52.92]I doubt that's a real duck.
[35:55.79]Let's go investigate this guy.
[35:59.49]I'm not stalling.
[36:00.83]What?
[36:00.95]Use a notebook to set your next test as Schroeder's apartment.
[36:13.32]Earl Schroeder.
[36:15.16]Set as destination.
[36:20.07]Does this guy have my GPS?
[36:24.59]I want to turn the volume down on this guy.
[36:26.58]He just hits square when he gives you directions.
[36:31.04]I love it.
[36:34.56]Straight on.
[36:35.94]How did you GPS send that to you when you made the wrong turn?
[36:39.20]Straight through the intersection.
[36:40.52]Oh, I didn't listen.
[36:41.22]Now that wasn't so hard, was it?
[36:42.72]Just because we're in uniform doesn't mean we can't use our initiative.
[36:46.17]I guess so.
[36:47.35]Seems a little too good to be true.
[36:48.87]That was a taxpaying traffic light.
[36:53.05]If Schroeder's our shooter, he's no criminal mastermind.
[36:56.52]Turn left here.
[36:58.38]Careful!
[37:02.22]Don't even turn left.
[37:06.83]Why would I turn left?
[37:07.87]Oh, shit.
[37:08.49]Alright, where do we go from here, TomTom?
[37:16.71]He has no directions for me.
[37:23.88]50 airtime points.
[37:25.20]Why is that blocked off?
[37:26.22]I should be able to go right across it.
[37:27.46]I have to go off the bridge now.
[37:42.98]why is that a submarine diving sound you can't stop a train that fast there it is finally Jesus
[38:08.92]Okay, good.
[38:09.90]We're good.
[38:13.96]Take a jump.
[38:17.82]I just gotta find an opening.
[38:20.39]Stop the train, GTA.
[38:21.57]No, there's an opening there.
[38:23.51]I don't even need to go over the bridge.
[38:26.91]Got it.
[38:27.17]Alert!
[38:28.77]Alert!
[38:44.34]Really, in GTA you can go over it fast.
[38:52.08]And we're not stopping there.
[38:56.22]If you called out within the next five minutes, you'll get two shark steamer mops for the price of one.
[39:10.12]This car can't explode, right?
[39:11.56]Cars couldn't explode back in the 50s, could they?
[39:17.72]Stop!
[39:20.56]Shrouda's apartment, 11.09 PM, and it's a Saturday.
[39:24.76]Sunday, whatever day it is today.
[39:26.55]You can't get it, like, clipped.
[39:40.90]Gold handles allow you to go in.
[39:43.74]Shall we sit here on the bench?
[39:48.92]Let's wait for him to come out.
[39:49.62]We need to, like, stake him out.
[39:52.16]Let's see, what's it, uh... Schroeder is 2.
[39:54.10]Schroeder.
[39:56.30]Harbin 2.
[39:58.56]Look in the trash, hold on.
[40:00.33]It might be... It might be used teeth in there, or something.
[40:06.21]No, that's, uh, like, the... You know that on CSI, when they would always have the interesting guy, like, the interesting murderer.
[40:11.97]Just... You eat people... You bite somebody with false teeth, and then just replace your teeth.
[40:16.91]Murder weapon gone.
[40:21.32]What do you guys want?
[40:22.58]I'm Officer Cole Phelps.
[40:23.63]This is Officer Dunn, Wilshire Division.
[40:26.19]You're the owner of a Smith & Wesson Model 27 nickel-plated with pearl grips?
[40:30.49]I might be.
[40:31.93]What of it?
[40:32.69]Then you'll be surprised to know that Scooter Payton was murdered tonight with your gun.
[40:37.33]You're out of your mind.
[40:38.80]Scooter?
[40:39.76]He works for me.
[40:40.54]I have that gun here in my drawer.
[40:42.60]Wait a minute.
[40:43.78]That's impossible.
[40:46.22]What the fuck is going on here?
[40:47.56]You're under arrest, Schroeder.
[40:49.00]Cuff him, Ralph.
[40:49.58]No way.
[40:50.22]You're not taking me down for this.
[40:54.05]Okay, so we are just... We are the GTA police.
[40:59.21]And this guy has like two stars.
[41:00.91]I didn't even know this was in the game.
[41:12.44]Quit prancing around and hit me.
[41:17.51]Well, I missed.
[41:18.52]I did miss.
[41:19.54]He's right.
[41:23.26]Ralph, you alright?
[41:25.32]I'm fine.
[41:25.94]I hardly felt it.
[41:27.84]He's lucky he caught me off guard.
[41:31.32]Keep an eye out, Ralph.
[41:32.08]I'm going to take a look around.
[41:33.55]We don't even know if he did it or not.
[41:37.61]What is he eating?
[41:39.53]Cereal, pasta.
[41:41.29]Oh, another bottle.
[41:46.42]Okay, he's got cigarette butts.
[41:48.51]Let's take a look.
[41:50.95]Swallow it.
[41:51.33]Don't take this as anything.
[41:53.73]You have to swallow it, though.
[41:54.49]You have to digest it.
[41:59.90]Okay, well, that's not relevant.
[42:04.10]Hmm.
[42:10.30]For a salary of... Okay, let's say... We're going to go for superpowers here.
[42:14.44]If you had a superpower that allowed you to determine... Like, you were essentially a laboratory.
[42:20.44]You were a hospital lab.
[42:23.86]But you had to ingest any item to determine where exactly... Remember, like, Connor?
[42:29.32]You taste the blood.
[42:30.56]Like, if he ate that cigarette, he would know exactly who smoked it and how long they smoked it for.
[42:38.27]Would you do it?
[42:39.29]Put $200,000 a year?
[42:41.59]I'm not stalling.
[42:42.39]I'm like investigating.
[42:43.47]What are you talking about?
[42:44.99]I'm asking a question.
[42:47.73]That's not stalling.
[42:48.83]That's giving conversation.
[42:50.95]Pick up the tomato on the ground.
[42:53.66]Stalling.
[42:54.82]Oh, he's stalling.
[42:56.84]Next person that says stalling.
[43:02.62]We got a present.
[43:12.55]Well, it looks like a lot of people are getting presents this year.
[43:22.02]Circumstantial.
[43:23.72]Nothing on there?
[43:24.32]Okay.
[43:24.54]What about this weird comic book?
[43:31.37]I don't think so.
[43:31.97]Mystic Tales.
[43:32.71]Is it over the back?
[43:33.27]Wait, is this like
[43:41.12]What the hell was that?
[43:42.63]Nothing on the stove.
[43:43.35]What about his dresser drawer?
[43:46.23]He's gonna have like a passport in here we can scan.
[43:52.55]Okay, Artie Rosenberg, Summers, Frank, Clayton, Kappa, Dalby, Freddie, Floyd Rose.
[44:05.86]List of names in a series of numbers.
[44:08.86]Floyd Rose's name is in this book.
[44:12.67]You can sit on the sofa.
[44:13.35]Can you sit on the sofa?
[44:14.22]Wait, hold on a minute.
[44:15.14]This guy did it.
[44:15.82]I told you guys I knew who was there.
[44:17.92]That guy did everything.
[44:18.48]I just got called it in the beginning of the game.
[44:45.65]Why are we getting the Assassin's Creed sequencer?
[45:02.00]I completed this case in 15 minutes of my first playthrough.
[45:07.50]So...
[45:09.03]You dumb fucking sons of bitches.
[45:10.91]Get in this line now before I lose my temper.
[45:13.49]Excuse me, Sergeant, but... I spent 20 minutes getting the stream ready.
[45:16.34]You say another word and I'll break your fucking head and have you in the brig.
[45:19.66]Some of us are here for... I know why you're here, asswipe.
[45:23.13]I'm having a bad day, Private.
[45:25.29]Some people don't seem to want to get on this bus.
[45:27.21]He didn't ask for your help.
[45:27.97]He didn't ask for your help.
[45:29.21]Can you believe this guy?
[45:30.64]Who are you two?
[45:31.64]Abbott and Costello?
[45:32.46]We're here for OCS, Sergeant.
[45:33.68]So it's the three fucking Stooges and you're here for OCS.
[45:37.36]God help this fucking fight.
[45:39.44]Are we under the Harry Potter blanket right now?
[45:41.06]The Japanese will do the world a favor and kill you quickly.
[45:43.77]All three of you are on report.
[45:45.29]What are your fucking names?
[45:46.99]Phelps.
[45:47.55]Kelso.
[45:48.23]Merrill.
[45:50.60]We're like sitting there, spying.
[45:52.42]Cool.
[45:52.58]Okay.
[45:52.86]Do you make money in this game and do you have to buy upgrades?
[46:22.69]Well, you picked the right place, Cole.
[46:25.02]A city that needed an honest cop like a thirsty man needed water.
[46:29.08]You'd heard the stories, but you weren't interested.
[46:31.62]You were here to fight the good fight, solve cases, right wrongs.
[46:36.00]With the forces like politics, there's no sitting on the fence.
[46:40.04]You have to choose sides.
[46:41.46]That's not true.
[46:42.23]A brown paper envelope or a Greyhound ticket to Palookaville?
[46:47.06]We'll take that.
[46:47.56]It's only a couple blocks from here.
[46:49.10]14 Adam calling KGPL.
[46:49.94]We'll handle the 211.
[46:50.76]Is he talking into a hamburger?
[46:51.94]What the hell was that?
[46:52.68]He was talking into a dog toy.
[46:53.86]What was that thing?
[46:54.82]14 Adam on route.
[46:55.56]Subdue the robbery suspect.
[46:56.27]Sure thing.
[47:22.30]I don't like that sound.
[47:23.30]I never have it on in GTA either.
[47:25.91]You didn't know about this in the sacred side street, did you?
[47:39.25]Watch it!
[47:43.23]You didn't know about this in the side street, did you?
[47:46.41]Make it quick, you guys!
[47:47.15]The cops are here!
[47:47.86]We gotta move it!
[47:50.60]Watch out!
[47:50.96]Watch out!
[47:51.40]Oh, that looks like Jirba!
[47:54.70]That looks like Jirba!
[47:55.56]That guy looked like Jirba!
[48:04.20]Oh, shit!
[48:04.80]I just... Try for the front door.
[48:10.08]Keep your gun down.
[48:14.26]We don't know how many are in there.
[48:17.30]Take them slowly.
[48:19.16]I didn't know there was actually gun fights in this game.
[48:21.66]Stay down.
[48:28.24]Oh, he's got a tommy gun.
[48:30.26]It's always a tommy gun, right?
[48:36.02]That's it?
[48:36.52]I got him.
[48:36.98]We got them all?
[48:37.70]I shot the whole shoulder.
[48:38.62]I think we got him, Cole.
[48:40.18]Should be all clear.
[48:44.64]Lieutenant Hopkins says anytime you reach for the shotgun, you're either going to end up dead or wearing a citation.
[48:49.76]So I guess... It's okay, Ralph.
[48:51.78]You did well in there.
[48:53.70]I'm glad you had my back.
[48:55.40]Man couldn't ask for a better partner.
[48:56.90]Incoming death sequence, right?
[49:00.78]We're friends.
[49:01.62]I'm good friends of yours.
[49:03.99]See you in the next cutscene, where you inevitably don't exist anymore.
[49:12.06]This kind of opportunity comes along once in a lifetime, Hank.
[49:16.54]I have to grasp it.
[49:18.46]You have to survive it first, Cole.
[49:20.06]Why am I not playing this in VR?
[49:21.06]Because I don't have the VR helmet.
[49:23.62]If I can make a name for myself in this war.
[49:25.52]It's in the moving truck.
[49:26.76]Thinking of taking on a company of the Emperor's finest single-handed?
[49:31.09]You don't seem the Sergeant York type to me.
[49:32.91]When I need your opinion, Kelso, I'll ask for it.
[49:36.53]They talk about officers like you in boot camp, Cole.
[49:39.77]They call it the Custer Syndrome.
[49:41.90]Guys who go around dreaming of fame and glory and getting all of their men killed in the process.
[49:46.40]Our duty is to lead, Kelso.
[49:48.44]And their duty is to die for your wonderful future?
[49:59.19]I gotta get this ready.
[50:00.67]Hold on a second here.
[50:08.60]Cole Phelps and Jack Kelso.
[50:11.34]With some people, it's as simple as chemistry.
[50:14.26]Two guys who should have been friends, but their personalities got in the way.
[50:18.91]Phelps, a good guy, a wild way too tight.
[50:23.07]And Kelso, a quiet man who could never walk away from a fight.
[50:29.62]Well, it's a shame you don't like to talk about it, Cole.
[50:32.22]Ralph, friends who want to stay friends don't discuss religion or politics.
[50:37.51]In my case, you can add the war to that.
[50:40.41]I know that bum.
[50:41.75]Wendell Bowers.
[50:42.79]I put him away before he jumped parole.
[50:46.20]Get after him, Phelps.
[50:47.22]I'll head him off in the car.
[50:48.58]Goddamn it.
[50:50.32]Wendell Bowers!
[50:51.38]Stop!
[50:51.64]LAPD!
[50:51.82]You people screw yourselves.
[50:55.06]Is there a tackle?
[50:56.06]Why, you...
[51:00.85]It's a little parkour sequence.
[51:02.75]Watch out, that was a monster!
[51:03.67]Watch out for the fucking gigantic robot monster.
[51:09.49]Bowers!
[51:10.17]Hold it right there!
[51:12.51]Stop now or I will shoot!
[51:15.94]Don't shoot him now.
[51:17.44]Jesus, Dunn!
[51:18.28]Watch your fire!
[51:19.02]Why would you shoot him, like, right here?
[51:24.80]Get down from there right now!
[51:27.44]Give it up, Wendell!
[51:30.52]Okay, Detroit's Become Human did this game, but with robots.
[51:34.83]Hey!
[51:36.67]Remember this?
[51:37.97]We already did this.
[51:47.60]The same roof is in that game.
[51:49.86]That's where the guy falls off the edge over there.
[51:51.38]Remember?
[52:04.61]Give it up Bowers!
[52:05.55]There's nowhere left to go!
[52:07.85]Oh no, he's hiding.
[52:11.67]Looks like we've got the place to ourselves.
[52:18.60]Give it up Wendel!
[52:19.64]Can I throw him off the roof?
[52:31.33]Persistent little shit.
[52:35.32]Throw him off the roof.
[52:37.96]How you doing, Wendell?
[52:39.94]Your parole officer's feeling lonely.
[52:42.38]He's got a hole in his life for an asshole like you.
[52:45.49]You can make it up to him in ten years' time.
[52:48.67]Watch your head.
[52:50.51]This hump will be back in the Iron Hotel by tomorrow night.
[52:53.65]That's the name of this fucking thing.
[52:54.63]Nice work, Cole.
[52:56.16]You run track in high school?
[53:06.04]Damn it, clone.
[53:06.38]It's not on YouTube.
[53:33.36]trying to get the scene where they're underneath the invisibility cloak and they're being quiet.
[53:38.29]I was gonna play that scene in the corner while this was going on.
[53:55.92]I'm sorry, Captain, but I joined the Marine Corps to fight the enemy, not get involved in this schoolboy chicken shit.
[54:01.00]Kelso, in my office, now!
[54:03.46]That guy had a lot of facial animation.
[54:06.76]That was a really cool dream sequence right there.
[54:16.23]For every cop, there's a case that makes you.
[54:19.67]Gives you that leg up.
[54:21.07]Gets you recognized as a shining new star in the squad.
[54:24.81]The case that you solve that shows that you have the gumption, the gung-ho, the get-up-and-go to make you stand out from your average rank-and-file patrolman.
[54:33.17]This could be the one goal.
[54:39.10]So I'm seeing a lot of people come in and ask about my life.
[54:41.66]LAPD!
[54:42.42]Could you stand clear of the body, please?
[54:43.80]Should I have like a hashtag or something?
[54:46.72]We've called an ambulance and the police, but I'm afraid he's dead.
[54:50.48]Exclamation point, like Mike.
[54:53.71]Okay, stand further back and move along.
[54:56.03]It's your choice, but make it quick, people.
[54:59.63]Hey, Cole.
[55:01.55]You got here quick?
[55:02.35]My beat crosses 7th Street.
[55:04.05]Okay.
[55:05.21]You're first reporting, then.
[55:06.40]We'll get a perimeter going and move the crowd on.
[55:09.52]You better see what you can find out before the homicide dicks show up.
[55:13.04]I'll be with you in a moment.
[55:15.54]Alright.
[55:15.98]Let's examine the body.
[55:17.24]Everybody stay back.
[55:18.34]Let us do our job.
[55:19.54]He had a golden tube?
[55:21.14]Odd daylight.
[55:22.73]Crowded street.
[55:24.81]I've seen everything.
[55:29.14]Okay, examine the victim's head and arms.
[55:33.54]Which one are his arms?
[55:36.50]I forget.
[55:36.86]Been on the force for 30 years.
[55:41.24]I can't, like, open and close his mouth.
[55:47.61]I mean, definitely something happened to his mouth here.
[55:59.13]Nothing?
[56:00.77]Other side?
[56:11.52]Nothing?
[56:12.22]How do you have nothing here?
[56:12.96]What about his stomach?
[56:22.73]Nothing?
[56:25.29]What about in here?
[56:25.85]There we go.
[56:27.35]That's... There's his ID.
[56:30.06]Bank of America.
[56:30.90]Okay, name, uh, Galeta, apartment 5.
[56:37.47]Pearl earrings.
[56:38.39]So he was, okay, he was coming to do some pawns.
[56:41.29]Payments made.
[56:45.13]Martin P. Layaway ticket number.
[56:46.69]The merchandise is not fully paid for in Galeta.
[56:51.55]Layaway receipt.
[56:52.91]Pearl earrings.
[56:54.39]Made out to Bank of Arcadia.
[56:55.79]Okay.

[57:40.36]That's her voucher.
[57:41.76]Interviews are conducted using the notebook.
[57:45.63]Witness details are entered on the left.
[57:48.57]Okay.
[58:09.00]Eyewitness account.
[58:10.08]Shoe store clerk.
[58:11.36]Eyewitness to murder of Everett Gage.
[58:19.89]Well, then we should make sure.
[58:21.07]Okay.
[58:23.61]Thank you, ma'am.
[58:26.77]There's something shiny over here.
[58:39.49]Ah, guess what I thought.
[58:42.13]Bullets.
[58:48.69]Okay.
[58:51.38]I just stepped over that guy like he was a wet floor sign.
[58:58.12]Really?
[58:58.44]Alright, hold on.
[59:01.02]I want to see my clues here.
[59:04.28]Let's look at the little layaway voucher.
[59:05.92]Okay.
[59:06.22]Receipt for pearl earrings.
[59:08.82]Made out on Bank of America to see Galeta.
[59:13.43]Okay.
[59:15.61]32 caliber shell casings.
[59:16.57]Five rounds total.
[59:17.33]Found on sidewalk.
[59:18.19]Okay.
[59:22.41]I know who did it.
[59:22.96]Oh, shit.
[59:25.08]I did.
[59:27.46]Put it down.
[59:27.84]Okay, let's go.
[59:35.02]I'm not done with this, with the examination.
[59:37.16]Ooh, what's in here?
[59:38.90]Ooh!
[59:40.88]There's a gun in here!
[59:46.34]Wonder what happened here?
[59:49.93]Okay, go back to the gun store.
[59:53.73]Just tell the witness I'll be right back.
[59:54.99]Alright, let's go to the gun store.
[60:00.03]I'll do, I'll go.
[60:00.91]Just tell her to wait.
[60:01.93]I'll be right back.
[60:03.38]Where's the gun store?
[60:08.81]It's over here, isn't it?
[60:11.47]Just keep her busy.
[60:12.89]I need to find out whose gun that is.
[60:13.89]Oh, it's a picture store.
[60:17.07]That's a fucking wine store.
[60:18.69]That's a... That's a meat store.
[60:21.23]Okay, no.
[60:21.91]It's not over there.
[60:24.91]Okay, I need to go to locations.
[60:33.84]Gun store.
[60:34.28]Alright, set up the destination.
[60:37.08]Let's go.
[60:48.37]Trying to imagine you with a personality.
[60:50.33]Is there anything else I can do in here?
[60:58.16]Should I... I should just talk to her?
[61:00.26]Alright.
[61:01.04]Do you think you could tell me exactly what happened, miss?
[61:03.90]I look around the shops at lunch.
[61:07.40]I was in a store when Mr. Gage... Lie.
[61:11.10]My boss burst in yelling that I'm late on my lunch.
[61:15.12]Liar.
[61:15.68]And?
[61:16.60]We came back.
[61:19.04]I was angry.
[61:21.16]I walked in front.
[61:24.60]I heard shots.
[61:26.50]I turned and saw Mr. Gage fall.
[61:29.32]Really bad acting workshop lessons.
[61:36.82]To accuse a witness, you'll need to present evidence.
[61:44.21]Let's take a look.
[61:47.09]Alright, she's doing a...
[61:51.29]She's doing the like, I just shit my pants on the train.
[61:54.08]And I can't move from the seat.
[61:56.54]But I have seven or eight more stops.
[61:58.60]Let's hold on a second here.
[62:05.47]I don't know who shot Gage or why.
[62:08.49]No, officer.
[62:13.69]A man is dead, Miss Goleta, and it's a criminal offense to lie to a police officer.
[62:17.21]I ought to take you downtown.
[62:19.09]Get out.
[62:20.60]Get out right now.
[62:22.22]Huh?
[62:22.60]Send in one of the other policemen if you must, but I won't say another word to you.
[62:30.19]Oh, really?
[62:32.17]Well, isn't that just something?
[62:33.39]We have the murderer.
[62:34.47]No murderer.
[62:35.35]The girl saw it all, but she clammed up on me.
[62:39.23]We could trace the gun.
[62:40.19]Eagleson's gun store's a couple blocks from here.
[62:42.55]You thinking what I'm thinking?
[62:43.67]Tate!
[62:44.79]Maintain the perimeter.
[62:45.71]This is what I wanted to do before.
[62:46.79]Hey.
[62:49.74]I'll get her to talk.
[62:50.50]Let me show you some old-fashioned technique.
[62:57.24]What?
[63:01.51]What happened?
[63:01.89]I backed up.
[63:02.49]Don't you people have anything better to do?
[63:05.77]I backed the car up.
[63:11.47]I ran over the body.
[63:14.23]Oh, well, I'll just avoid the body.
[63:17.03]What the fuck?
[63:20.30]It's because I broke the... I hit the parking meter.
[63:28.86]That's not part of the crime scene.
[63:30.14]That's just state property.
[63:31.23]Build me.
[63:32.93]How do you think Spider-Man and Superman deal with this shit?
[63:35.27]Are you kidding me?
[63:37.83]No, but please stop everything when I run over a fucking parking meter.
[63:42.13]Superman destroys entire buildings.
[63:45.81]Give me a break.
[63:59.60]Don't hit the sidewalk.
[64:00.94]I won't hit the sidewalk for the rest of the time or you're all gonna get a present.
[64:06.05]That's two presents this year.
[64:09.27]You already got one.
[64:18.97]Oh, look at that!
[64:20.35]What a perfect clean turn.
[64:32.67]Now, I'm allowed to go on the sidewalk as a person.
[64:34.83]Just, we're aware of that, right?
[64:37.45]Slow down!
[64:43.80]Alright, we've got a gun.
[64:45.36]I want to see who bought it, and I want to know what you know.
[64:47.66]Officers, what can I do you for?
[64:50.14]I will drag you out of here.
[64:51.64]Officers, Phelps and Dunn, sir, Wilshire Division.
[64:54.42]We need you to trace a serial number.
[64:56.12]Sure.
[64:57.44]What's the make and model?
[64:58.76]F.M.
[64:59.04]Browning, model 1922.
[64:59.94]The serial number is 01138.
[65:01.54]Stop.
[65:01.82]I've got to listen to this.
[65:03.00]Don't say.
[65:03.64]Well, I didn't sell it.
[65:06.73]Europeans love them, but it's pretty rare you find one over here, although I did have one in here a couple weeks back.
[65:13.01]Remember the owner?
[65:13.81]Yeah.
[65:14.95]Kalu.
[65:15.75]Edgar Kalu was his name.
[65:17.45]Thing looks like he'd never been fired, but he brought it in here for cleaning anyway.
[65:20.83]Okay.
[65:21.41]Then he bought a box of cartridges and he left.
[65:23.68]Do you know where we can find Mr. Kalu?
[65:25.60]Told me he was on his lunch break.
[65:27.82]Said he worked at Heartfield Jewelry Store just up on Broadway.
[65:31.80]Thanks for your help.
[65:36.52]Investigate Heartfield's jewelry.
[65:39.68]Open up the handy-dandy notebook.
[65:46.36]Jewelry reseller, employer of suspect Edgar Kalu.
[65:50.16]Let's go talk to him.
[65:56.90]Out of the car!
[65:57.65]Police!
[65:57.91]What?
[65:58.15]No, this is not my car.
[65:59.27]Hey!
[65:59.63]That's the same.
[66:07.23]I thought it was the same car.
[66:11.35]I didn't know you could take other people.
[66:12.81]Should I not get in this car?
[66:13.91]What is this music this guy's listening to?
[66:16.65]That wasn't sidewalk.
[66:19.29]That's not the sidewalk.
[66:22.13]This is not even the right car.
[66:23.25]The wrong car.
[66:23.87]That was for each individual vehicle.
[66:28.20]That was for that vehicle.
[66:35.70]No, you don't get a present.
[66:36.44]That was in the squad car.
[66:45.67]Officer, can I interest you in a new watch?
[66:53.00]The ACB Network presents national news from Washington.
[67:04.09]It's down!
[67:08.56]Fuck!
[67:09.00]I can't do that.
[67:09.96]He's trying to get in the car.
[67:11.66]Oh, whatever.
[67:12.48]I'm not stalling!
[67:14.54]This is not stalling!
[67:15.40]Oh shit, is he dead?
[67:37.44]I just knocked his hat off.
[67:38.46]He's fine.
[67:42.58]It's alright.
[67:43.08]He just had the equivalent of having, like, one heart of damage in Super Mario World.
[67:47.95]He lost his hat.
[67:50.23]Hello, police.
[67:51.01]Open up.
[67:51.29]Officer Cole Phelps.
[67:52.63]Are you Edgar Kalu?
[67:54.61]Uh, no.
[67:55.81]Mr. Kalu is out back.
[67:57.51]He said he had to lie down.
[67:59.27]I'll buzz him for you.
[68:02.63]Lie.
[68:04.54]Son of a bitch!
[68:05.28]Lie.
[68:05.64]Go, Cole, go!
[68:08.56]Press X to lie.
[68:09.75]I mean, press X for doubt.
[68:10.77]Check on those fucking strangers.
[68:12.65]Don't do that now.
[68:13.55]I don't know where he went.
[68:16.13]Where'd he go?
[68:17.23]Where'd he go?
[68:17.57]Where is he?
[68:17.83]Where'd he go?
[68:18.77]Kalu, get back here!
[68:23.07]Aim.
[68:24.65]Get out of... Why would you stand up?
[68:30.48]Why would you stand up?
[68:37.31]Too late Kalu.
[68:52.66]I thought he was a murderer.
[68:53.82]He's a murderer and he killed me.
[68:55.42]What a terrible one.
[69:02.38]Officer Cole Phelps, are you Edgar Kalu?
[69:05.28]What, like a child response?
[69:07.00]That was like a four-year-old's response.
[69:10.66]I'll buzz him for you.
[69:11.46]Yeah, go get him.
[69:16.03]Son of a bitch!
[69:17.11]Go, Cole, go!
[69:20.69]I can't get it.
[69:21.15]Never mind.
[69:24.61]Thanks for pointing to where he is.
[69:25.95]I'll make sure to... I didn't know.
[69:28.72]I thought this guy just murdered six people.
[69:30.32]Kalu, get back here!
[69:35.39]Hands up.
[69:35.57]Nice.
[69:35.67]Take his mask off, see who he is.
[69:36.87]I wouldn't have gotten away with it.
[69:45.24]It was the doctor!
[70:05.97]The case that makes you and the case that breaks you.
[70:09.51]The one you never solve.
[70:11.15]The one that keeps you awake at night.
[70:13.57]The case that gnaws at your guts and ruins your marriage.
[70:16.95]The case that keeps you propping up a bar as you relive the what-ifs, the might-have-beens, the half-leads, and the half-truths.
[70:24.84]The case that other cops murmur about whenever you walk past.
[70:28.32]I wonder who's talking right now.
[70:29.24]The case you never, ever discuss.
[70:33.04]God's mill may grind slowly, but it grinds finely, son.
[70:37.66]I hear it's you who nabbed our malefactor from the shooting yesterday.
[70:40.86]Yes, sir.
[70:41.86]Then tell me, Boyle, I hear you're quite the climber, a man of initiative.
[70:46.91]How would you like a chance at smiting this man with the sword of justice?
[70:51.87]You're asking me to conduct the interview, sir?
[70:54.39]I am, young Phelps.
[70:56.43]You've only been with us a short time, and you've assembled yourself a stellar arrest record.
[71:01.29]not to mention the fine work you did in the war sending heathens back to the hell they came from but I'm curious as to whether you can turn your hand to interrogation I can do it a certain animal coming lad do you think you might be ready for that I'm ready for it yes sir I know I made my mistake last time I'll figure it out good man you need many things for a conviction young folks did you turn the volume down I did a lot of
[71:26.48]Opportunity, hard evidence, and best of all, a confession.
[71:32.24]If you fail in the former, you can always use a modicum of violence to obtain the latter.
[71:37.02]Violence?
[71:38.36]How are you feeling, lad?
[71:39.99]Fine, sir.
[71:40.59]Gulp.
[71:41.81]Very good.
[71:43.15]The evidence is overwhelming.
[71:45.21]May the cat eat him and the cat be eaten by the devil.
[71:48.43]Bring me a confession, young Phelps.
[71:51.01]This is your chance.
[71:52.93]Don't fail me.
[71:53.81]Do not disappoint me.
[72:00.85]What's wrong with his arm?
[72:01.49]Why is his arm smoking?
[72:02.35]You don't get a lawyer, Keira.
[72:03.67]Mm-hmm.
[72:03.91]What happened here?
[72:04.77]View evidence.
[72:05.35]Okay.
[72:05.64]Fatal sidewalk shooting incident.
[72:06.40]One male victim.
[72:06.98]Layaway receipt.
[72:27.21]Receipt for pearl earrings made out to Bank of Arcadia to see Goleta.
[72:32.11]Okay.
[72:33.43]32 shell casings.
[72:35.37]This is an FN Browning handgun.
[72:37.73]Model 1922 handgun.
[72:40.09]Serial number 01138.
[72:44.88]He had the pistol serviced.
[72:49.26]With the same serial number.
[72:51.44]I'm ready.
[72:53.46]Let's talk about the shooting.
[72:56.12]Do you deny shooting effort, Gage?
[72:58.32]I'm a businessman.
[72:59.50]I run a jewelry store.
[73:00.80]I don't know what you're talking about.
[73:03.02]I'm sure my lawyer can clear all this up.
[73:07.97]Lie.
[73:13.27]See?
[73:17.27]That was a lie.
[73:23.72]He did like the... Oh, look over on the side of the...
[73:26.60]You blew a man out of his socks over an empty grudge, you son of a bitch.
[73:29.53]Do you think I have sympathy for you?
[73:31.81]Hold on.
[73:32.15]Wait, wait, wait.
[73:33.51]Keep needling me.
[73:34.67]Try the rough stuff and my lawyer will be making an official complaint.
[73:39.94]I've just got to keep my mouth shut and watch you run around in circles.
[73:43.38]We're done.
[73:44.52]Unless you want to keep making a schmuck of yourself.
[73:48.18]So you get me.
[73:50.25]So hold on a minute.
[73:51.01]I'm trying to understand.
[73:53.76]Get back in there and raise some lumps, boy!
[73:55.86]I need a confession!
[74:01.02]Good cop, bad cop?
[74:02.48]Like, I don't understand this.
[74:05.93]What does that even mean?
[74:06.79]Has my lawyer arrived yet?
[74:08.35]I want to see my lawyer.
[74:10.11]A lawyer can't help you, Mr. Kalu.
[74:12.25]You shot a man dead in cold blood.
[74:14.41]You're going to have to pay for that.
[74:18.80]Let's, okay.
[74:19.54]Let's talk about the shooting.
[74:22.26]Just angry versus not angry and manipulative?
[74:24.38]I don't understand.
[74:25.38]Good cop is he's telling the truth.
[74:26.86]Bad cop is he's lying to you, but you don't have evidence.
[74:46.68]Okay, so instead of that's a true statement or that's a lie, it's good cop, bad cop.
[74:57.20]Why the hell would they change that?
[75:05.42]They changed it for the PS4?
[75:06.80]Okay, well, that's weird.
[75:11.01]So triangle is he's lying.
[75:14.58]Square is, I have doubt, and X is, I think that was a true statement.
[75:23.07]So then he's a liar.
[75:25.77]You deny owning a Browning pistol.
[75:27.55]Serial number 01138.
[75:29.67]I owned a gun, yes, but it was stolen in a burglary a couple years ago.
[75:35.12]You can't prove I used my gun on Gage.
[75:39.36]I mean, I think I can.
[75:40.34]There were casings there.
[75:45.88]Square is more like put pressure.
[75:49.76]Okay.
[75:50.34]Murder weapon serviced.
[75:52.99]Shell casings.
[75:54.09]Let me look at these.
[75:54.91]What?
[75:55.03]I wanted to look at them.
[75:55.59]Wait, hold on.
[75:56.61]I wanted to look at the casings.
[75:57.79]I wanted to look at the casings.
[76:10.56]You disappoint me, Cole Phelps.
[76:12.92]He's going to tell me to get in there.
[76:14.86]Get back in there and do it again.
[76:19.02]How am I so bad?
[76:21.68]I've just been told that they changed.
[76:25.39]Like, for some dumb reason.
[76:27.35]The entire system.
[76:28.29]I want to see my lawyer.
[76:30.43]It's confusing.
[76:32.19]You shot a man dead in cold blood.
[76:34.35]You're going to have to pay for that.
[76:39.29]Give me the evidence.
[76:43.10]They just changed the words.
[76:44.38]What?
[76:44.92]What?
[76:46.04]What?
[76:46.40]Why?
[76:46.74]Why would they ever do that?
[76:47.71]Alright.
[76:49.77]Well, here's the handgun.
[76:51.47]I know he owns it.
[76:53.33]He literally owns this handgun.
[76:56.37]And he had the weapon serviced.
[76:59.37]But I don't... What do I have for... There's a guy dead.
[77:07.65]There are the shell casings.
[77:09.99]This is the layaway voucher.
[77:13.29]He had it serviced.
[77:14.39]Okay.
[77:15.81]So... Let's talk about the shooting.
[77:19.88]Do you deny shooting Everett Gage?
[77:22.12]I'm a businessman.
[77:23.28]I run a jewelry store.
[77:24.58]I don't know what you're talking about.
[77:26.80]I'm sure my lawyer can clear all this up.
[77:29.81]Well, that's bullshit.
[77:30.87]Okay, so... You're lying.
[77:33.99]The gun was serviced.
[77:38.34]You deny owning a Browning pistol.
[77:40.12]Serial number 01138.
[77:42.24]I owned a gun, yes, but it was stolen in a burglary a couple years ago.
[77:47.68]You can't prove I used my gun on Gage.
[77:49.65]Yeah, you had a service ticket.
[77:50.87]I get how the system works now.
[77:54.83]You had the gun cleaned and bought a new box of ammunition.
[77:57.65]The store owner remembers you and where you worked.
[77:59.77]Is that so?
[78:01.55]It's amazing what the Nebbishes will recall when it suits them.
[78:06.63]Possible religious motive.
[78:10.26]Okay.
[78:11.20]Let's change the subject.
[78:13.52]You fasting for Yom Kippur, Mr. Kalu?
[78:15.48]Yeah, let's change the subject, you going motherfucker?
[78:17.96]How about baseball?
[78:19.78]You're not denying you're a Jew, Mr. Kalu.
[78:22.07]This is America.
[78:22.85]It's not Germany.
[78:23.99]It's not a crime.
[78:25.17]Some people don't like Jews, Mr. Kalu.
[78:27.31]Yeah, and I guess you're one of them.
[78:28.53]Gage hated Jews, didn't he, Mr. Kalu?
[78:30.65]I don't know what you're talking about.
[78:31.79]Okay.
[78:34.90]So, I mean, he's obviously very upset about this.
[78:40.36]So I would... I would... I mean... I would probably put a little bit of pressure on this guy.
[78:51.62]I'd say, hey, like... I mean, oh, we could just go right... We'd change the subject.
[78:59.00]Or he's a liar.
[79:05.48]Do I... Do I have proof?
[79:08.31]I don't think I have proof...
[79:12.19]I mean, I have his handgun, I have his bullets, and I have this voucher.
[79:20.43]Kalu and Gage.
[79:21.25]I don't know anything about Gage, though.
[79:23.03]I'm not... I don't know anything about, um... So what does intuition do?
[79:29.84]I'm curious.
[79:31.90]Select remove an answer to narrow down your... So this is like, ask the audience?
[79:36.48]Careful use of intuition can lead to breakthroughs in interviews and interrogations.
[79:40.22]Select ask the community for statistics.
[79:49.49]If only somebody that worked for the forum could have told you more.
[79:51.93]Well, yeah, but I didn't even know how this game's systems even worked.
[79:56.96]No internet connection.
[79:59.06]I can't do it.
[80:02.34]No, I don't need to do this.
[80:04.00]Pull it back.
[80:05.43]I'm gonna pressure him here.
[80:08.81]You left-wing leaning parasite.
[80:11.37]You expect me to sit here and listen to your drivel?
[80:14.03]You call me that?
[80:15.29]You sit there and you call me those names, you goddamn gory butt snatcher?
[80:19.43]You and that schtump Gage!
[80:21.33]Why did you do it, Mr. Kalu?
[80:22.69]Here we go.
[80:23.31]Gage.
[80:24.17]He's in the Chamber of Commerce.
[80:25.61]He's in with all those momsers.
[80:27.18]He blocked every proposal I ever put forward.
[80:29.68]Kiked this and kiked that.
[80:31.62]He's been trying to ruin my business for years.
[80:34.38]Edgar Kalu, I'm charging you with the first degree murder of Everett Gage.
[80:38.32]Jesus.
[80:39.42]I respect your beliefs and your right to hold them.
[80:42.26]I hope for your sake the jury can commute to murder in the second degree.
[80:47.23]May God have mercy on you, sir.
[80:48.37]We got him.
[80:56.35]What did I do with that?
[80:57.07]I didn't have my lawyer.
[80:58.29]Masterfully done, Officer Phelps.
[81:01.78]It is just Officer Phelps.
[81:03.74]Isn't it, lad?
[81:05.60]Yes, sir.
[81:07.16]Let me have a word with the chief of police, young Phelps.
[81:10.29]The department needs heroes.
[81:12.23]A shining, honest face the public can admire.
[81:15.45]I applaud a man with your talent for unwavering justice.
[81:19.53]Back to your duties for now, boyo.
[81:21.58]But here's a piece of advice.
[81:23.72]Get yourself two suits.
[81:25.08]Get them pressed.
[81:26.70]You'll be needing them.
[81:31.65]good cop truth bad cop is you know doubt accuses that part you just lied and then whatever they say you have to prove that if you're gonna if they're lying you have to prove it by selecting the thing that they're lying about in the book I understand see I had keen interrogation instincts I got the check mark
[82:09.41]First try.
[82:10.17]That was the tutorial?
[82:16.51]Yeah, and the purpose of the tutorial is to make it so you understand the game when the game is ready to be played.
[82:22.88]The driver's seat.
[82:23.74]Welcome to the game.
[82:24.50]That's the point of a tutorial.
[82:28.74]To teach you how things work.
[82:32.54]Now let's rave... Let's rave some lumps.
[82:46.85]Here's your new desk, kid.
[82:48.13]You're on traffic.
[82:49.33]The hot sheet is posted here, next to the map.
[82:51.91]What's his problem?
[82:53.07]Oh, my fucking arm.
[82:53.75]He just broke my arm.
[82:54.49]He's an institution.
[82:55.93]So this is what all the fuss is about.
[82:58.20]Why couldn't they build a freeway that goes past my place?
[83:00.20]They haven't even approved the money yet, kid.
[83:02.32]The bond issue won't be till December.
[83:04.64]It'll be years before any of this will happen.
[83:06.58]Here's your new partner, Stefan Burkowski.
[83:09.02]I've heard all about you, Phelps.
[83:10.90]You go easy on me and let me earn the odd citation, and maybe we'll get along fine.
[83:14.92]I'm here to learn, detective.
[83:16.77]He's an intense one, isn't he, Mel?
[83:18.85]Who's intense?
[83:20.27]The newly minted detective here, Cole Phelps.
[83:22.65]Hi, Phelps.
[83:23.89]I'll be keeping an eye on you.
[83:25.37]I could spend a little time basking in reflected glory.
[83:28.78]Make a change from busting hookers and dolphins.
[83:33.52]Who was that?
[83:34.46]Roy Earl, chief detective and advice.
[83:36.66]Do they all dress like movie stars?
[83:38.74]Roy is a movie star.
[83:40.42]And the whole of the seedy side of L.A.
[83:42.68]is his audience.
[83:45.05]What is that supposed to mean?
[83:47.23]Stick with me, kid.
[83:48.81]You'll find out.
[83:50.31]Alright.
[83:51.83]Welcome to L.A.
[83:52.66]Noire.
[83:54.56]And now some housekeeping.
[83:56.36]Warm Central Division welcome for Detective Cole Phelps.
[84:00.06]This is like math class.
[84:02.00]Some of you guys may know Phelps.
[84:03.58]He's the cop who broke the jewelry store murder.
[84:06.63]Stand up and take a bow, Phelps.
[84:09.71]If it's alright with you, sir.
[84:10.55]That's an order, Phelps.
[84:12.75]Shh, quiet, everybody.
[84:14.27]See, really, it's like a school.
[84:16.49]Phelps is one of only two serving LAPD officers who received the Silver Star during the war.
[84:23.55]Really gave it those lousy Japanese, eh, Phelps?
[84:26.65]I did my best, Captain.
[84:28.13]Why are you war heroes always so modest?
[84:31.43]I'm partnering Phelps with everybody's favorite pole, Stefan Vakowsky.
[84:35.73]Hope you like work, kid.
[84:36.89]Vakowsky sure as hell doesn't.
[84:38.13]Well, that's why we have partners, right?
[84:39.93]Okay, okay, can it, guys.
[84:41.75]Hey, detention for you.
[84:43.05]Stick with Vakowsky.
[84:44.21]Go to the office.
[84:44.69]He's a good cop.
[84:45.63]He knows traffic inside and out.
[84:47.38]You don't throw things in my classroom.
[84:48.74]Oh, that's it.
[84:50.40]I'm gonna pick up the phone on the wall.
[84:52.26]That's how you know you're in deep shit.
[84:54.12]Don't make me lift up the fucking phone.
[84:56.58]Alright, let's go.
[85:19.79]They really pushed you through quick, didn't they?
[85:21.95]Six years on patrol before I got this desk.
[85:23.99]You were here in five minutes.
[85:25.35]What do you want me to say?
[85:26.39]I didn't ask for any favors.
[85:28.63]How do I sit down?
[85:35.02]Hold on.
[85:36.14]How do you pretend to be an actor?
[85:43.94]You know this place?
[85:46.36]I gotta pee.
[85:49.48]Bad.
[85:49.84]God damn it.
[85:54.66]You look super.
[85:55.24]There are 95 different vehicles.
[85:57.36]Alright, I'm gonna pee my pants.
[86:00.88]Give me one second.
[86:01.48]I'll be right back.
[86:02.14]I have to write on the screen that I'm peeing.
[86:06.48]Give me one second is fine, too.
[88:11.51]Howdy.
[88:13.95]I'm sorry.
[88:18.66]The words came out too quickly.
[88:21.94]Chat is up past bedtime?
[88:23.02]It's like 4.30.
[88:23.36]What do you mean they're up past their bedtime?
[88:30.74]This is what I mean.
[88:31.33]The students are all going crazy.
[88:33.03]Students, excuse me.
[88:35.39]Sit down.
[88:37.27]You know, like, okay, if I was a teacher, let's go over some...
[88:40.97]Let's go with some grade A teaching here, okay?
[88:45.63]You wanna know how you get a bunch of kids to quiet down in a classroom?
[88:49.98]I'll show you.
[88:54.00]You go like this.
[88:56.22]First of all,
[88:58.90]you know this has nothing to do with it this is not you don't you don't like drink in the class that's not how you first of all what you do is this is a technique that I when I used to be a substitute teacher let me put that down so I don't talk about like teaching and like alcohol in my hand um nice sweater this is not a sweater this is a stretchy okay look at yeah a sweater you're gonna call this a sweater look it's a stretchy look
[89:30.15]okay so uh if there's a bunch of rowdy kids you just have to be rowdier than the kids like they'll they'll quiet down and listen immediately if there's if it's like a ton of noise and a bunch of kids like oh you just walk in and you just go like and they'll all go the fucking and they'll sit down and be like
[89:57.46]And then you have your attention.
[89:59.76]That worked every fucking time.
[90:06.54]You know what I mean?
[90:12.04]He can speak dolphin.
[90:15.24]You just have to do something weirder than what they were doing and immediately then they wanted to listen to you.
[90:25.35]Did I just get $50?
[90:33.00]Baked Flakes, thanks for the 50 fucking dollars.
[90:37.63]Thank you so much, dude.
[90:38.99]Just got my wisdom teeth out.
[90:41.19]You'd not believe how easy it is to buy bits while drugged up.
[90:45.41]Oh god.
[90:46.87]Just to let you know, using Bad Cop the entire game will improve your gaming experience.
[90:52.73]Anyway, thanks for the laughs and don't tell the non-drugged up version of me that I stole his wallet.
[91:02.09]Good luck to you on your recovery.
[91:05.27]But thank you so much, Baked Flakes.
[91:07.44]Hope you have a swift, swift recovery.
[91:10.30]Get some rest.
[91:12.00]And hopefully the drugged up version of you does not cause regular version of you any financial problem because of that.
[91:25.01]But make sure to take care of yourself, okay?
[91:28.95]And now I'm out of here.
[91:30.40]We're going to go back to the game.
[91:35.61]Drug money.
[91:39.15]You might not know how you deal with a bunch of kids.
[91:41.66]I'll tell you.
[91:44.77]You know, actually, I wanted to, um, I didn't, like, this is just one more small thing.
[91:49.04]Like, one more small thing.
[91:50.26]I'm not stalling.
[91:51.76]I'm not stalling.
[91:53.08]One more small thing.
[91:53.88]I wanted to bring a flute in when I was a substitute teacher.
[91:57.60]I wanted to just, anytime, like, the students were acting up, if they heard, like, the flute.
[92:02.04]I don't know how to play the flute at all, by the way.
[92:04.08]I wanted to just bring it in, like, a little suitcase and put it underneath the desk.
[92:08.45]And then just be like... It's like they were acting up and that would be like, oh shit, it's time to be quiet.
[92:15.61]Like if Mr. Elbertson brought out the fucking flute, holy shit, that means we're in trouble.
[92:24.22]I never brought it up though.
[92:25.02]I figured they would think I was a weirdo.
[92:29.44]But that was one of my tactics I was going to use.
[92:37.68]Please play the game.
[92:40.32]Yeah, I mean, but like one last thing, though.
[92:42.32]Like, let's take over the whole screen.
[92:44.24]One more thing just before we get to the game.
[92:48.20]Man, cut the grass.
[92:51.75]You ever do it?
[93:02.55]I love the IRL streams.
[93:04.05]Don't play the game.
[93:06.49]No, I'm gonna play the game.
[93:08.67]This game's fucking cool.
[93:11.69]Let me just put my headset back on and be a gamer.
[93:17.29]What is the stalling meme?
[93:18.71]I don't know.
[93:19.41]Don't ask me.
[93:20.15]Somebody said something.
[93:21.08]You know, here's what happened.
[93:22.02]Somebody said... Alright, let's go.
[93:29.04]See?
[93:30.32]Now everyone's gonna be quiet.
[93:33.58]Why aren't they using the siren?
[93:35.78]Jesus Christ!
[93:37.36]Are you asleep over there or what?
[93:38.58]Alright.
[93:38.94]Respond to dispatch?
[93:40.07]Wait, do I have to go... Slow down before someone gets hurt.
[93:48.72]Now that's what I call a stall.
[93:50.39]Tell me a little about yourself, Phelps.
[93:52.35]Are we friends now?
[93:53.47]That's what I call a stall.
[93:56.77]You grew up in San Francisco.
[93:59.24]My father was a singer.
[94:00.70]Went to college at Stanford.
[94:03.44]Did two years ROTC before Reno CS at Camp Elliott.
[94:13.01]Are you fine?
[94:14.39]-2 execution, +2 jump.
[94:16.31]Don't you say that.
[94:19.76]I grew up in San Francisco.
[94:21.96]My father was in shipping.
[94:23.10]Went to college at Stanford.
[94:25.32]Did two years ROTC before Marine OCS.
[94:28.40]This sounds like the guy that... Shipped out in early 45 as a first lieutenant.
[94:33.22]What was his name in this?
[94:37.15]Oh my god, he's got 50 more dollars.
[94:42.90]Hey, here's the thing, guys.
[94:44.12]Like, here, I just, I got 50 more dollars.
[94:48.96]Who was it?
[94:51.10]Pocket polling, thanks for the 50 fucking bucks.
[94:55.92]Oh, oof, I have nothing to say, so here's a story.
[94:57.82]I was forced to rent a $91 textbook yesterday, and the best part is it was an e-book.
[95:04.52]90 days, $91.
[95:05.44]I'm fucking miserable.
[95:12.80]What?
[95:18.49]$91?
[95:23.67]That's fucking ridiculous.
[95:27.11]You have to rent an e-book?
[95:30.43]Is there no stop at the nickel and diming art students?
[95:35.20]Will they ever stop nickel and diming our goddamn students?
[95:45.57]That's actually un-fucking-believable.
[95:46.93]You know what I mean?
[95:52.71]Like, that gets me, like, seriously, just... Actually, you can't even hear this, so I don't know why I'm gonna put it up.
[95:59.42]Substitute teacher.
[96:00.40]That's what I'm saying!
[96:01.16]I care about our students!
[96:03.63]I was going to pull up the fucking flute playing, but you can't hear it because I don't have anything plugged in.
[96:09.68]But thank you so much, Pocket Pauling.
[96:10.98]So I already heard about that... that bullshit.
[96:15.66]That's stalling.
[96:16.36]That better not be something that Paragon would want to see.
[96:18.16]I will eat a full pizza.
[96:18.80]Over the course of, like, a few days, if that happens.
[96:21.15]No, I will eat a full pizza.
[96:31.91]Covered in mayonnaise.
[96:32.87]I hate mayonnaise.
[96:33.73]It's gross.
[96:39.01]Up on the roof, officer.
[96:40.31]He has a mask on his face.
[96:42.37]I caught sight when he shoved past me, but be careful.
[96:44.68]I saw him waving a gun.
[96:45.70]He's got a gun?
[96:52.32]Game audio is too high.
[96:54.82]How's that?
[96:55.60]Sounds better?
[96:55.98]Why is he wearing that mask?
[97:00.54]Subdue the suspect.
[97:02.75]Easiest thing you've had me do all day.
[97:05.74]Can't slide?
[97:10.02]Slide!
[97:11.66]Get off of this!
[97:13.42]Get off!
[97:15.24]What the hell?
[97:21.78]That's not him.
[97:22.32]I thought that was him for a second.
[97:25.80]Ah!
[97:31.20]every man for himself why who's saying that watch it I can't just shoot him like in his toe what where's the stuff wait I don't take him down take him down alright you're coming with me
[98:07.17]I didn't I thought you couldn't shoot these people like these I don't know.
[98:10.70]I thought that you can't do it.
[98:12.26]Is he dead?
[98:12.72]Wait, I killed him?
[98:21.00]He died No, why I thought I Oh, that's a that's a 40 street crime dude.
[98:30.99]That's that's a fun street crime.
[98:33.31]He used the gun on me
[98:37.47]Okay, plus an institution point.
[98:41.09]Speaking of our institutions... What are they doing to our students?
[98:48.05]I can drive any car.
[98:52.47]Get in the car, get in the... Hold on, slow down!
[98:54.47]I gotta work with my partner to get in.
[98:56.43]Alright, Mrs. Daisy, come on, get in.
[99:10.87]Why won't he get in?
[99:12.77]Is there a reason?
[99:16.37]I don't understand why he won't get in the car.
[99:19.18]Didn't they see me?
[99:19.86]Move, you idiot!
[99:26.43]Look at these people!
[99:47.28]I turned this guy into fucking cheese He dead took that much to kill That guy was made out of iron
[100:05.35]Wow, okay.
[100:06.55]Sorry.
[100:13.77]That dude was made out of fucking aluminum.
[100:17.23]Let's go.
[100:25.54]Take a left on Chestnut Street.
[100:29.04]Yep.
[100:29.88]I'm gonna respond to every single one of these.
[100:32.04]I don't even care about the game.
[100:34.47]I like just being like an old-timey cop.
[100:37.45]You need to doubt lies.
[100:38.89]Who cares?
[100:39.41]That's why I wanna do these.
[100:41.89]Alright, the shot's fired, right?
[100:52.18]So I get to use force.
[100:54.54]So we're gonna use it.
[100:56.78]We're gonna aim our car gun.
[101:00.80]It's like Spider-Man, but with cars.
[101:02.46]And like 50 or 60 years ago.
[101:07.04]With this finger snapping music in the background.
[101:11.65]You can snap, back in the old days, you could snap your fingers with two hands.
[101:20.57]Listen to that.
[101:21.55]Alright, let's go.
[101:33.85]Not while driving.
[101:34.65]Yeah, you can.
[101:36.09]I just did it.
[101:40.80]That's called clapping.
[101:41.96]No, you snap with both hands.
[101:46.24]You can snap with both of your landmarks.
[101:53.83]Okay, I got ranked up for that.
[101:59.61]Do I like the Buick?
[102:01.27]It's pretty nice.
[102:04.32]One of the Who Framed Roger Rabbit cars are in this game because I want to use them.
[102:09.40]Flapping is easier.
[102:10.24]It doesn't sound the same.
[102:16.19]Take it easy, Phelps.
[102:17.45]I'd rather get there in one piece.
[102:24.13]Ooh.
[102:26.77]I felt that one hurt.
[102:27.75]That actually hurt my body.
[102:39.18]Where is this crime?
[102:42.54]This is far away.
[102:47.57]Drive safely.
[102:49.81]What?
[102:49.99]I don't need to drive safely.
[102:51.23]I just have to get there.
[102:53.51]Landmark.
[102:53.89]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[103:00.35]Here he is.
[103:00.71]He's right here.
[103:01.59]One.
[103:02.97]Two.
[103:03.91]Uh-oh.
[103:05.72]I see you, motherfuckers.
[103:06.88]Come on up here and get us.
[103:08.84]What is all this?
[103:10.08]Traffic stopped from hell.
[103:12.16]Prowling pulls these guys over.
[103:14.32]Finds a trunk full of hardware like you wouldn't believe.
[103:17.64]They lose it.
[103:18.16]Bullets start flying.
[103:19.62]And they snatch up the guns and one of the cops.
[103:21.26]If I press R3, I get slow motion mode, right?
[103:23.88]Up there.
[103:25.22]Still alive, we think.
[103:26.82]Who knows for how long.
[103:28.99]We'll keep him busy if you can find a way up, sir.
[103:35.85]Hmm.
[103:40.87]Wasn't that interesting.
[103:49.99]Wait, that- wasn't that guy supposed to- That guy didn't last long.
[103:55.87]That guy didn't last long at all.
[104:01.19]Okay.
[104:07.83]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[104:09.19]Is that guy alive?
[104:10.92]Can I take a shotgun?
[104:12.44]Yep.
[104:13.00]Perfect.
[104:18.30]Alright, watch out, watch out.
[104:27.70]Okay, cover the street, that's fine.
[104:30.18]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going as fast as I can.
[104:31.80]Here we go.
[104:36.01]That was a jump cut.
[104:39.15]Incapacitate the suspect before he fires.
[104:40.55]What?
[104:40.69]No!
[104:40.75]Shit!
[105:01.17]11k.
[105:02.10]I've been involved in a shooting.
[105:03.22]It's code 4 here, but suspects are down and I need an ambulance at Chateau and Valencia.
[105:08.08]Also notified Detective Headquarters.
[105:10.28]I thought I hit his hand.
[105:11.78]I hit his hand.
[105:15.02]I thought he dropped a gun.
[105:16.72]I solved it.
[105:18.92]It's fine.
[105:22.46]This isn't like Dark Souls, guys.
[105:25.53]He died, but they died at the same time, so it's okay.
[105:27.57]I don't have to do it over again.
[105:31.02]He hit his shoulder.
[105:31.84]Yeah, so he should have dropped a gun.
[105:43.11]You need to headshot him.
[105:44.17]Well, that's not what it said.
[105:45.19]It said incapacitate.
[105:47.79]I didn't know I had to shoot the guy in the face.
[105:50.37]Everybody just gave me so much shit for shooting the other guy.
[105:54.37]So now it's like, alright, well, I don't want to like shoot the dude in the face.
[106:05.77]Hey, listen to this beat!
[106:12.97]Oops, sorry, gotta get the wheel again.
[106:14.33]I bet you couldn't have done that if you did the game in the same spot.
[106:20.04]Oops.
[106:20.90]Take it easy!
[106:33.63]That would be all.
[106:35.85]Oops.
[106:38.07]Cars don't explode in this game, right?
[106:41.91]Do cars explode?
[106:43.29]I don't think they do.
[106:46.01]Cars didn't have enough inside of them to explode back in like the 50s.
[106:49.89]Right?
[106:52.97]How did somebody else get out of that car?
[106:58.53]No, back in like the 40s, guys, cars ran on banana peels and rubber bands.
[107:04.16]I think you're doing this on purpose.
[107:05.36]Well, I'm not.
[107:05.72]That's somebody in chat.
[107:11.76]He's so bad.
[107:12.48]He has to be doing this on purpose.
[107:13.70]He's not pretending.
[107:14.50]Right?
[107:15.30]One of you guys just said that.
[107:36.34]How am I stalling now?
[107:41.24]I'm driving in a straight line to the objective.
[107:43.08]Can I tip it?
[108:00.06]smoke smoke smoke that cigarette he lacks required information alright let's go in three two one action that you Bukowski yeah go on through
[108:28.40]That song made me want a cigarette.
[108:29.64]Don't smoke cigarettes.
[108:31.63]Don't do that.
[108:34.77]The detectives are here now.
[108:37.85]You repeat to them what you told me.
[108:40.19]This is like the 40s, man.
[108:42.62]Cigarettes are essentially Flintstone vitamins back in the 40s.
[108:57.26]This is your first case, Phelps.
[108:58.67]It's okay to admit it if you're stumped.
[109:00.29]Okay, here we go.
[109:00.61]If you don't know what to do next, just come talk to me and we'll see.
[109:04.19]This is a real test to see if I could be a detective.
[109:06.11]Thanks, Stefan.
[109:07.43]You're okay.
[109:15.58]Never mind.
[109:19.46]Instant fail.
[109:21.05]Instant fail.
[109:23.82]Check the trash can.
[109:24.58]Okay, I'm gonna make sure I get all the evidence.
[109:26.06]There's no time limit.
[109:26.50]We have an owner for the car?
[109:46.06]Car is registered to an Adrian Black, just north of Bunker Hill.
[109:50.00]Alright, we'll take a look around.
[109:51.74]I'll keep Mr. Wilkie talking, but don't make him wait too long.
[109:55.24]He's the restless type.
[109:56.32]Okay.
[110:02.35]I'd be such a bad detective.
[110:04.13]I would show up and just do what I just did.
[110:05.53]I can't hide it either because... I can't hide it because there's a microphone right in my mouth.
[110:11.63]So, you're gonna hear that.
[110:13.89]It's gonna happen.
[110:15.97]Oh, it's one of those like snapping machines.
[110:17.99]Forget about what you just heard.
[110:20.61]What is it?
[110:21.03]I want like the fun music again.
[110:22.23]Let's take a look.
[110:27.51]Open up the trunk.
[110:28.77]Can I fit in there?
[110:29.39]Alright.
[110:33.14]This is a tire iron.
[110:34.98]Nothing of interest on it.
[110:37.74]Put it down.
[110:39.28]What about the sponge?
[110:41.99]mmm still dirty and it opens up to it has lines on it somebody's run a bunch of stuff on the sponge Morgan picked up a live pig yesterday so weird okay and with Morgan he bought a live pig for three dollars okay that's weird so that's a it's a pig in there right
[111:10.98]Whoa.
[111:12.54]Wow.
[111:13.28]Okay.
[111:16.60]Victim looks to have lost a lot of blood.
[111:19.12]Lost a lot of blood.
[111:20.04]He was killed with a chainsaw while he was driving.
[111:27.26]How else do you make this happen?
[111:35.26]Hmm.
[111:36.91]Have you got a wide shot of the car and its surroundings?
[111:39.21]Listen, you and I have never met, so I'm just going to go ahead and say this once.
[111:42.33]If you don't tell me how to do my job, I won't tell you how to do yours.
[111:47.87]Who's calling me?
[111:50.43]I can't answer that.
[111:52.61]And I'm too far away to turn it off.
[111:57.81]Doc, Detective Phelps.
[112:00.91]Rude.
[112:01.22]What have we got?
[112:01.98]A lot of blood from a blunt force injury.
[112:05.96]It's Otto.
[112:06.42]Somebody was exploded in here.
[112:09.90]Is there anything else I can do?
[112:11.40]I can't take a sample, can I?
[112:14.82]I don't think there's anything I can do about this.
[112:19.65]I think it's just gross.

[113:19.56]That's like a Joker origin.

[113:50.49]I agree.
[113:53.15]I just burped again.
[113:54.01]I'm trying to pretend like I didn't.
[113:54.99]Nothing in these boxes.
[114:02.58]Nothing in there.
[114:03.78]Well, I don't know.
[114:05.72]Somebody could have thrown something.
[114:10.87]Shotgun.
[114:13.21]Nope.
[114:13.59]Just a pipe.
[114:16.83]Insta-Heat.
[114:18.02]The brand name might give us something to go on.
[114:20.30]The brand name.
[114:21.44]And, okay, if they have Insta-Heat in their house, I gotta look at their house and see if they have Insta-Heat.
[114:26.30]Alright, that's all the clues.
[114:32.50]Am I gonna do a BioShock joke?
[114:33.82]I mean, I can't do a BioShock joke because I've never played BioShock from start to finish.
[114:37.34]Alright, I can't fuck this up.
[114:39.11]So where did you get the chainsaw?
[115:02.85]Bloodstained pipe, okay.
[115:05.11]So, purpose of the scene... Moya, what's he doing here?
[115:11.14]Like, what were you doing here?
[115:11.94]Hmm.
[115:12.08]Okay, I mean... He's a railroad worker.
[115:33.56]But, I mean, why is he doing the little kid that did something wrong with his hands behind his back?
[115:41.69]Did you see anybody else in the yard?
[115:43.35]Maybe somebody hanging around the car?
[115:45.75]Nope.
[115:46.79]I hadn't seen a soul all day until you boys turned up.
[115:49.59]Okay.
[115:56.17]Knowledge of Adrian Black.
[115:57.71]Do you know Adrian Black, Mr. Wilkie?
[116:01.81]No, sir.
[116:02.97]That ain't a name I'm familiar with.
[116:04.41]Okay, he's staring straight at me.
[116:10.85]I don't see any... He's not... He's just... He's blinking.
[116:15.95]All humans blink.
[116:19.12]No, he's telling the truth.
[116:20.86]You ever seen the car before?
[116:23.42]Funny enough, I did.
[116:25.42]A couple of nights ago, it was over there in the parking lot.
[116:28.97]I know most of the cars are parked here regularly.
[116:31.52]So it kind of stood out.
[116:33.30]Hmm.
[116:34.82]Okay.
[116:37.70]The wallet by the car.
[116:39.42]Was there anything in it when you arrived?
[116:41.76]You accusing me of something, mister?
[116:43.68]Uh-oh.
[116:46.13]Hmm.
[116:47.21]That was... That was a lot different.
[116:51.05]That was a lot different.
[116:52.97]That was... That was eyes rolling, smiling.
[116:55.53]What is he doing?
[116:56.47]What is with this?
[116:59.99]That body language is all over the place.
[117:02.57]Do you want the patrolman to hold you down while we turn out your pockets, Mr. Wilkie?
[117:07.17]Maybe I checked inside that wallet.
[117:09.58]Not that I was going to steal anything.
[117:12.28]Maybe I took a look.
[117:14.54]But there weren't no money in there.
[117:16.56]Not even change.
[117:18.08]Okay.
[117:21.61]What about the blood-stained pipe?
[117:23.77]Did you smash his head in?
[117:24.63]What about the steel pipe with blood on it near the car?
[117:27.21]Do you know anything about it, Mr. Wilkie?

[118:23.45]When you saw the blood, was it wet, bright red, or darker like it is now?
[118:28.88]Darker, I'd say.
[118:30.82]So they've been dead for a while.
[118:34.36]Thank you for your help, Mr. Wilkins.

[139:15.84]Okay.

[139:28.21]A man is dead.
[139:33.14]I'm ready to investigate.
[139:36.01]Nothing else I can see.
[139:37.05]I already know that separate bedrooms, separate houses, separate people, separate parents, separate couches.

[139:46.83]Let's go.
[139:50.83]Slaughterhouse receipt.
[139:51.56]He bought a pig.
[139:57.75]Yes, of course.
[139:59.28]I would hope they'd have separate parents.
[140:02.64]I would hope so, too.
[140:05.10]I'm missing a clue, knucklehead.
[140:07.20]What?

[140:28.82]Okay, slaughterhouse receipt.
[140:29.82]Frank Morgan wanted a pig.
[140:30.50]Okay, that sounds pretty accurate.
[140:49.45]What makes you say that about Morgan, ma'am?
[140:51.45]He's the foreman at my husband's plant.
[140:54.26]Very shady character.
[140:56.42]I told Adrian he needs to keep his distance from the staff.
[141:00.62]They're always out drinking together.
[141:03.14]Okay, so we got a new name here, the pig man.
[141:06.42]Okay, where is Adrian Black?
[141:16.75]Rewind that and delete it.
[141:18.43]What did she say?
[141:19.41]What did she say?
[141:20.21]I missed it.

[142:48.47]He came home early from work.
[142:51.01]He never comes home early.
[142:54.49]And he went out early, too.
[142:56.46]Watch that neck movement.
[142:57.46]He normally never leaves for the bar till about seven.
[143:00.82]Hmm.
[143:02.64]Alright, so where the hell were you?
[143:05.42]I think you should come clean with us, Mrs. Black.
[143:07.68]Your husband is missing, and after our search, I'm willing to call the circumstances suspicious.
[143:12.29]Can you account for your movements last night?
[143:14.93]Let's see.
[143:16.01]You're not accusing me, are you?
[143:19.00]What an awful thing to say.
[143:20.67]I was here all night, of course, waiting for Adrian to come home.
[143:27.99]Where are you?
[143:33.90]Where are you?
[143:37.40]Okay, this sounds a little... There's a little bit of a weird ostrich neck gyration.
[143:52.97]Is there anyone who can vouch for that?
[143:56.31]Let's hear alone.
[143:59.29]No, not Comcast.
[144:00.69]No, no, no, no, no.
[144:02.92]I cooked Adrian's dinner and waited, but he never came home.
[144:08.16]God damn it.
[144:08.84]Don't fucking do it.
[144:09.60]I knew we were gonna... That's why I started early.
[144:12.36]I started early because I knew this shit was gonna happen after a few hours.
[144:16.36]Alright, we're okay.
[144:16.92]We're okay.
[144:17.28]Just don't pay attention to it.
[144:18.36]It'll go away.
[144:20.68]Alright, the bar.
[144:23.34]Your husband frequents Kavanaugh's bar.
[144:25.90]How did you know that?
[144:28.79]Adrian practically lives there after work.
[144:36.83]Okay.
[144:39.09]Okay.
[144:43.49]So Adrian spends a lot of time there.
[144:45.80]Up until recently.

[145:16.51]No, that's not glasses.
[145:18.25]He bought a pig.
[145:20.33]Stands of live glass broken and repaired.
[145:21.98]Found near abandoned.
[145:23.20]These are not new.
[145:25.22]That's a lie.
[145:26.72]These have been broken and they were repaired.
[145:30.70]Brand new, huh?
[145:36.48]Hmm.
[145:40.47]Interesting.
[145:43.43]isn't that interesting so you dispose of the new pair after you killed your husband you made a mistake in leaving the old pair behind got you I never did how can you be so heartless throwing around accusations at a time like this oh yeah who's Nicole then tell us about the photo of adrian in the bedroom what is there to tell
[146:13.95]it's from his most recent business trip to Seattle mmm isn't it though isn't it though a business trip but that could be true though that might be just true
[146:45.17]What was the purpose of Adrian's trip to Seattle, Mrs. Black?
[146:50.39]He was meeting with some distributors.
[146:53.23]She knows.
[146:55.35]Adrian said that it was important to make contact interstate.
[146:59.08]You know.
[146:59.32]Because he was going to grow his business.
[147:01.76]Really?
[147:03.44]We'll keep you informed, Mrs. Black.
[147:06.37]Please do, detective.
[147:10.63]Got it.
[147:13.58]You're under arrest.
[147:14.72]Wait, what?
[147:18.88]Way to go.
[147:19.28]I got four out of six.
[147:20.29]That's a fucking passing grade.
[147:21.77]That's like a 70%.
[147:22.93]I told you I'm not an A student.
[147:28.45]How do I drive a motorcycle through the window?
[147:31.17]You should have accused her.
[147:32.01]But I don't have enough evidence for that.
[147:33.77]I don't have any evidence for that.
[147:39.20]Where's my evidence?
[147:44.48]You see?
[147:44.98]Like, I don't have any evidence.
[147:48.70]Her lying face.
[147:51.77]Yeah, the glasses.
[147:52.65]Like, she replaced the glasses.
[147:54.77]That's not, I found a gun that you, I found the chainsaw that you tore your husband apart with.
[148:04.29]So you, yeah, you lied about the glasses.
[148:06.29]That doesn't mean shit.
[148:07.09]Mr. and Mrs. Black don't seem to have the happiest home life.
[148:10.15]He's too scared to divorce her, and she's too much of a shrinking violet to throw him out.
[148:14.21]If this hadn't happened, they could have stayed miserable together forever.
[148:19.13]I mean, yeah, she probably did it, but... Where's my evidence?
[148:25.82]She lied about the business trip?
[148:27.96]Where's your evidence?
[148:29.76]Jeremiah, if you lie about anything, you're a criminal.
[148:34.80]Apparently!
[148:38.30]I lied to you guys an hour and 20 minutes ago.
[148:43.58]Did I murder somebody?
[148:44.92]I told you I was going to pee.
[148:46.04]No.

[149:17.33]The water was already filled, and I had to start the stream, so I turned the stream on, and then I thought, fuck, the water's gonna get cold, so I jumped in the back and I shook around really fast, like I told you before.
[149:27.02]I got out, wrapped myself around in a towel, and now I'm here.
[149:30.83]That was a police officer.

[158:31.13]Water boredom?
[158:34.43]I'm tired of your shtick, Morgan.
[158:36.04]Spill it, or we take you out in the alley and we knock it out of you.

[159:57.04]People who sound convincing because they actually believe their own bullshit.
[160:01.74]I don't lie.
[160:02.50]Hard to catch out.
[160:04.28]Frank Morgan is not one of those people.
[160:06.53]No, he is not.
[160:10.69]Wrong address.
[160:11.89]Well, that's why he's in jail now.

[169:40.51]Talk to her.
[169:42.73]I don't wanna.
[169:46.43]Talk to her, talk to her.
[169:47.49]My god!
[169:48.43]I can't even talk to her.
[169:54.05]You guys don't even know what you're talking about.
[170:00.61]I can't talk to him.
[170:02.47]Did you guys seriously just tell me to do that and lie to me?
[170:17.12]I don't have a Nevada accent.
[170:20.02]Why the fuck would I have a Nevada accent?
[170:24.24]My whole... God damn it.

[170:26.44]Okay.
[170:30.23]No, I mean, like, the light turned, it was yellow for a second, and I still took the turn.

[170:39.45]Can you go in the glove box, Gary, and get the insurance?
[170:42.16]Fuck.
[170:44.86]Look, how much damage is there?
[170:46.38]I got a lot of damage, but you don't have very much?
[170:50.64]Maybe we just shouldn't even get insurance involved.
[170:56.90]Not again.
[170:58.08]Stalling, stalling.
[170:59.38]Quiet with that!
[171:00.84]I'm not stalling.
[171:04.24]Don't kill him, please!
[171:05.12]Just get in the car so I can just finish this mission.
[171:14.75]No, you... Let me... First of all, why would I have a Nevada accent?
[171:20.99]I've lived my entire life in the Boston area.
[171:26.11]I'm 33 years old.
[171:29.08]Get out of my way.
[171:29.72]I've got a place to be.
[171:31.66]What's going on?
[171:35.82]Why am I going so slow?
[171:38.18]Why did this become into like a little tykes fucking plug into the garage outlet car for like a four year old?
[171:46.01]What's this guy doing?
[171:50.27]The car is stalling.
[171:51.23]See, it's not even my fault.
[171:52.11]I didn't do anything.
[172:04.20]You drive.
[172:05.70]You drive it.
[172:06.16]No, I want you to drive this car.
[172:11.94]You drive the car.

[172:15.93]Oh, for the love of God.
[172:17.69]Seems like a decent guy.
[172:29.71]Look, I unlocked a car.
[172:33.55]Nice.
[172:36.96]This one has like a mouth too.
[172:38.06]There's like closes and opens and shit.
[172:41.74]Oh, I know what this is.
[172:42.34]This is from like one of the Jim Henson movies.
[172:45.45]Like a dinosaur mouth.
[172:46.75]Oh, no, it's broken.
[172:47.77]I wouldn't feel safe in a tank with you driving.
[172:52.19]You know, that's probably correct.
[172:55.87]We made it.
[172:56.27]This is Thanos' car.
[173:00.23]That looks like a Thanos' car.
[173:03.05]I think that looks like Thanos.
[173:05.22]Let's check the place out.
[173:06.67]I don't even know what that is.
[173:07.43]Stop saying it.
[173:14.53]Did I say it?
[173:15.03]I don't even know what I said.
[173:21.36]What does it want me to look at?
[173:24.06]I'm getting like an indicator here.
[173:25.50]Oh.

[174:19.09]Lie.
[174:19.25]He's going to sprint.

[174:40.66]They always do this.
[174:45.94]Hey, uh, just, uh, let me, uh, let me get my stuff and, uh, let me, uh, and they just rip around.
[174:51.48]It's like the Buffalo Bill thing.
[174:52.74]Remember when Buffalo Bill did this?
[174:56.20]And quiet down those lambs in the movie.
[175:05.82]We got him.
[175:10.64]Why not just come clean with her, Black?
[175:12.89]Why the melodrama?
[175:15.01]I thought it would be easier.
[175:16.57]No, it just got a whole lot harder.
[175:18.89]Adrian Black, you're under arrest for conspiracy and fraud.
[175:22.31]We'll see what the DA has to say about wasting police resources on a wild goose chase like this.
[175:26.76]You're going to lose your wife, lose your job, and probably end up in the big house.
[175:31.58]I'm going to get a big house?
[175:33.64]Nice.
[175:34.04]How many bedrooms?
[175:35.06]Like six?
[175:36.30]Sounds fucking pretty good.
[175:37.72]Don't make fun of me for that one.
[175:41.00]That turned out to be quite some case, huh?
[175:43.90]Adrian, what an idiot.
[175:46.21]You got an arrest and a clearance in your first case, and fine style, too.
[175:51.01]Well done, detective.
[175:52.61]Efficient investigation technique, good public presence.
[175:56.51]I'm so good at this game, aren't I?
[175:57.97]Learned from Bukowski here.
[175:59.96]You could go a long way in this department.
[176:01.70]This guy's bad at game.
[176:02.92]He's bad at game.
[176:03.74]Bad at game.

[176:19.86]And I got $7,888... Wait, what?
[176:20.66]Wait, wait, wait.

[176:55.51]That's insane.
[176:56.95]I'm not going to get in any car accidents.
[177:05.27]I'm going to try to avoid as many car crashes as I can.
[177:11.55]Doubt.
[177:14.82]And I'll stick my tongue in that van for $5.

[192:45.77]It can't have any street value.
[192:49.45]They took the flag off the car.
[192:52.51]And that's it.
[192:54.84]Okay, let's go.

[194:24.58]Using the headlights of an old Ford so they could strip the thing.
[194:29.10]So how do you know?
[194:29.68]So how the hell do you know?
[194:30.82]How would you know obscenities?

[207:19.79]You'll get it that way.
[207:31.96]You want it like that?
[207:33.46]That's the way you're going to get it.
[207:41.19]This is my proof that I'm looking at the screen cam.
[207:45.35]You understand?
[207:48.39]You guys are going to be a parrot on my shoulder, to keep me honest.
[207:51.98]Because if I turn to look at the chat room, you guys are going to know.
[207:55.78]You understand?
[208:08.92]So you guys are over here.
[208:12.56]Here's what I'm looking at.
[208:13.24]If I turn, you guys will know.
[208:21.01]There.
[208:21.47]That's better. ...
[208:40.07]See, if I turn to look at the chat, that's what it is.
[208:44.53]Like, again, remember, like, turn, he's looking at chat now.
[208:47.34]See?
[208:48.50]As long as I stay right here, I can focus on the fucking game and you can keep me honest.
[208:51.72]Keep me honest.
[208:52.30]Okay, let's look.
[209:06.25]I bet a broad's been driving this auto.

[209:29.18]You know what?
[209:30.28]Put them in the fucking way.
[209:57.45]There's nothing on there.
[209:58.73]How?
[210:05.83]I need to, like, tape this to my head, actually.
[210:07.57]That would make more sense, wouldn't it?
[210:13.24]I got an idea.
[210:14.52]This'll work.
[210:14.92]I'm gonna put it underneath my headset.
[210:19.50]Alright, so it is now under the headset.
[210:25.92]So now if I actually look over there, you'll see.
[210:32.19]Keep being honest.
[210:32.73]I don't want to look at chat.
[210:38.43]Not sure this means much.
[210:39.41]Oh, here's a license plate.
[210:52.90]How is that not much help?
[211:00.76]Is that a license plate?
[211:01.60]A missing license plate?
[211:31.83]I can't.
[211:32.97]I can't do it.
[211:34.25]It's more distracting.
[211:36.69]It's more distracting than if the camera was just pointed at my face.
[211:45.89]Not gonna do that again.
[211:50.61]Here we go.
[211:51.90]No good.
[211:52.68]We need diplomatic plates.
[211:59.94]That's all I can do in here.
[212:14.21]the fuck was that alright well where's uh he's missing a wrench if you don't mind we have a few questions association with valdez hackers are great cars but this doesn't look like the kind of place favored by foreign embassies how do you know valdez I don't know valdez the embassy bought the car all I know is he must know a quality car when he sees one
[212:53.55]I mean, I don't think that's a truthful face.
[213:00.98]I've had just about enough of you doing it.
[213:02.96]What's the angle with Valdez?
[213:05.80]The embassy bought the car.
[213:07.30]When it comes in for service, Valdez picks it up.
[213:10.23]That's it.
[213:13.85]Why did he do that?
[213:14.43]Why was he like... Where can we find Delgado?
[213:18.97]I don't know.
[213:19.47]He sure as hell isn't here.
[213:24.84]Bullshit!
[213:25.10]We got baited by the weird upside down mouth.
[213:47.55]A wrench from this dealership was used to strip the wheels from a Packard last night, Mr. Dewey.
[213:51.65]A couple of Hispanics were seen taking parts.
[213:54.61]We've had a spate of thefts ourselves.
[213:56.53]Comes with the location.
[213:58.93]Even bastards steal anything the minute your back is turned.
[214:01.61]Okay.
[214:14.53]So that's it?
[214:15.80]Like I said, the workshop's too close to the street.
[214:19.10]It's difficult to keep an eye on it.
[214:24.08]One out of three!
[214:25.40]And spreading the word that you don't like to cooperate with the LAPD.
[214:30.13]Time to visit Gabriel Delgado.

[215:14.18]Can we try to spare the general population please?
[215:18.00]Hey, look out for the pedestrians.
[215:23.75]That was way too close.

[226:45.99]Yes, you do.
[226:54.12]You're lying, Anna.
[226:55.60]I think you're a willing accomplice in these robberies.
[226:58.88]What proof do you have that I stole the cars?
[227:02.92]I've got proof.
[227:05.18]The stolen wheels are in your shed, lady!
[227:09.49]Bingo!
[227:10.91]The flag is in your front doorstep!
[227:13.83]Bingo!
[227:16.64]You got an old Ford in the front steps.
[227:19.95]Bingo.
[227:21.93]You stole a flag.
[227:22.97]Case closed.
[227:25.39]You come into my house to insult and bully me?
[227:29.12]I have known many policia like you.
[227:43.85]Gabriel wasn't at work.
[227:45.43]Where can we find him?
[227:46.37]He said he would never go back.
[227:50.68]Gabriel is out driving around in his car.
[228:15.36]If you don't tell me where he is right now, Anna, I'll put an APB out on him and ask them to shoot on sight.
[228:22.02]Please.
[228:23.32]Please don't kill him.
[228:26.16]I can't tell you anymore.
[228:31.47]As soon as we corner Gabriel, we'll be back for you, Anna.
[228:33.97]50%, man.
[228:34.35]You had your chance to cooperate.
[228:38.45]Let's get out of here, Phelps.
[228:39.79]Don't worry.
[228:40.57]I've got an idea.
[228:44.94]50-50!
[228:46.28]As all things should be.
[228:50.49]Never understood it.
[228:51.73]Too much to one side, or the other?
[228:54.29]She's going to warn him, Phelps.
[228:55.79]She gets all fucked up, bro.
[229:01.65]Tail the suspect from a safe distance.
[229:03.05]Suspect is marked in red.
[229:18.48]What car is he in?
[229:20.02]Easy, Cole.
[229:20.80]Better back it off.
[229:23.79]Okay, he's in that one.
[229:27.15]Careful.
[229:38.94]Whoa, he's freaking out.
[229:40.10]Go, go, go, go.
[229:41.44]Go!
[230:03.16]Smash him.
[230:03.76]Don't smash him, Jeremy.
[230:05.26]Smash him.
[230:06.24]Don't do that.
[230:08.32]Complete the mission and do it correctly.
[230:10.82]I want to do it.
[230:11.58]Don't do it, man.
[230:13.10]Relax.
[230:13.54]Stop.
[230:13.90]Slow down.
[230:28.96]I'm gonna rip the computer in half.
[230:33.30]I didn't even smash him either.
[230:34.70]What the fuck?
[230:44.15]Never understood it.
[230:45.39]The more rotten the boyfriend, the more loyal the girl will be.
[230:48.41]She's going to warn him, Phelps.
[230:49.51]We need to follow her.
[230:57.12]Jesus Christ are you asleep over there or what slow down don't put the siren on you idiot you've got a pretty funny idea of what keeping a low profile means phelps

[233:24.68]You can go right on red.
[233:44.79]Not in every single state.
[233:49.74]That's not true.
[233:50.26]That's only in a few states.
[233:53.08]And certain towns and counties, by the way.
[233:55.88]I can go through on red, though.
[233:57.56]I can go straight on red.
[233:59.23]In some counties.
[234:00.67]You've got a pretty funny idea of what keeping a low profile means, Phelps.
[234:21.10]I can go straight on red.
[234:33.84]You can go left on red in some places.
[234:37.00]As long as you count to three.
[234:38.02]One, two, three.
[234:42.30]You can drive on the wrong side of the road in a few jurisdictions.
[234:46.79]You can hit people in some jurisdictions too.
[234:49.83]He hit me, that's his fault.
[235:04.33]That would be a bad time to forget how to drive, guys.
[235:15.07]That's it, we're spotted.
[235:24.04]Back off.
[235:25.24]Hey, back off.

[235:57.58]Luigi came in and saved the day.
[236:04.73]That wasn't a joke.
[236:07.77]Game is terrible.

[236:13.60]Quick!
[236:14.28]They're getting away!
[236:16.78]Phelps, 1247.

[236:20.54]Reports of an illegal street place.
[236:25.25]Stay on Delgado.
[236:27.11]No, that's gonna distract me.
[236:45.27]I got to kill this guy.
[236:46.11]I have to kill him.
[236:49.92]Kill him.
[236:51.88]What?

[238:05.56]He's like a wheel of cheese.
[238:07.00]Gabriel Delgado, you're under arrest for Grand Theft Auto.
[238:17.71]Fuck you, puto.
[238:18.95]You should speak to the maricon.
[238:20.47]Valdez, I showed him.
[238:21.93]Now who's a man?
[238:23.50]I should burn his fucking collar.
[238:29.01]Shot him.
[238:29.97]I fucking shot him right in the back.
[238:31.45]You got a foreign dignitary outed as a fruit and a kitty.
[238:35.15]A car dealer we're going to let slide for the kickbacks.
[238:37.85]And a street punk car thief who sure as hell won't be taking leave.
[238:44.07]That detective Phelps is not a bad haul.
[238:47.47]You keep your chin low and your hands high and you keep bringing me clearances just like that one.
[238:52.43]That's textbook policing and we need more of it in this department.
[238:55.41]It was an 8 out of 9.
[239:15.09]Vehicle game, not bad.
[239:22.64]An audience with... I'm sorry, I forgot this is a thing.
[239:26.88]An audience with Consul General Valdez might have given you the thief as well as his motive.
[239:32.81]Whatever, fucking... We got the shitty hot dog store score.
[239:39.37]The roll on the little thing?
[239:41.01]There's like 10 gross hot dogs that have been there since like 4 o'clock in the afternoon and it's like 6 o'clock in the afternoon the next day.
[239:47.66]Hydrate.
[239:47.86]No.
[239:47.94]No.
[239:48.04]I'm not gonna hydrate.
[239:48.64]I wanna be dehydrated for the stream.
[239:49.72]Sorry guys.
[239:49.94]What the fuck?
[239:50.38]People are watching this idiot.
[240:13.04]Good job, Kelso.
[240:29.11]Are we going somewhere, gentlemen?
[240:31.07]Full inspection.
[240:32.63]Is that a gun?
[240:33.27]It'd better be exceptional if any of you want liberty this weekend.
[240:41.46]Kelso, this carbine, the bore is dirty.
[240:44.84]No, it isn't.
[240:45.78]Are you arguing with me, Kelso?
[240:47.62]Do what you need to do, sergeant.
[240:49.53]You know the bore is immaculate.
[240:50.99]Weekend liberty canceled.
[240:52.93]Two-day field drill.
[240:55.57]Clean this rifle.
[240:57.37]No.
[240:57.97]Do you know the penalty for insubordination, Kelso?
[241:00.83]Jack, don't do it.
[241:02.05]Forget him, Hank.
[241:03.31]He doesn't have what it takes.
[241:04.26]Are you two finished?
[241:07.48]Are you going to clean this rifle?
[241:11.61]So what's the whole story?
[241:14.03]Marriage made in heaven.
[241:43.10]Maybe he watched it?
[241:44.94]I know this guy.
[241:47.62]No, sorry.
[241:48.14]That's me driving.
[241:51.69]I already know who did that.
[241:52.99]I did.
[241:54.87]Don't even call the police.
[241:55.75]It was me.
[241:58.79]Alright, gentlemen.
[241:59.55]I just got this handed to me.
[242:01.29]A hit-and-run felony at Ray's Cafe, 208 North Los Angeles.
[242:06.53]Got a patrolman on site.
[242:07.71]The coroner's on his way.
[242:08.89]Get down there.
[242:09.45]See if you can find any witnesses who can put a make on the car.
[242:13.36]I want to make homicide.
[242:14.32]I mean, you know you've made it if you got that desk.
[242:17.94]Hey, I gave his wife a tap.
[242:20.81]Case closed.
[242:26.33]Alright, let's go.
[242:26.97]Let's go investigate it.
[242:29.49]Stan Lee.
[242:32.21]Alright, that's a great job to have.
[242:35.26]That really did sound like Stan Lee.
[242:45.03]Oh, there's a car here.
[242:55.04]New outfits.
[242:55.60]Where's my outfits?
[242:58.10]I got new clothes?
[243:00.42]Can I change in the office?
[243:05.14]Uh, duty patrol room.
[243:08.60]Detective, station commander.
[243:10.12]Where do I change clothes?
[243:37.46]Definitely that one.
[243:40.30]You match your partner?
[243:41.08]No, you don't want to match your partner.
[243:42.32]You want to look cooler than your partner.
[243:43.48]It's important.
[243:49.02]Now let's go back out here.
[243:49.90]And let's go.
[243:59.70]crime on the loose here.
[244:02.14]Looks like the DA is gonna press charges.
[244:04.83]Ana Rodriguez might do time.
[244:06.73]I'll speak to the DA.
[244:08.17]She's suffered enough.
[244:10.19]I don't know, Cole.
[244:11.29]She's an easy make and the DA likes me.
[244:14.77]I knew I should have driven.
[244:21.81]I'll convince him to let it go.
[244:24.59]How do you do that?
[244:30.54]God!
[244:35.18]What happened?
[244:41.43]Somebody ran him over.
[244:43.23]Find the make of the car.
[244:44.01]Find the wheels of the car.
[244:45.13]Find the lady of the car.
[244:48.57]Call it in.
[244:48.99]I'm gonna put my feet up on the computer.
[244:53.07]Hopefully I don't break it.
[244:57.30]Cole Phelps, traffic.
[244:59.04]What have we got?
[244:59.50]Thick as a white male, name of Lester Patterson.
[245:03.78]Walked out of the bar and into the street.
[245:05.84]Car hit over there and he ended up here.
[245:07.76]Dead on impact by the look of it.
[245:09.76]Have you canvassed the area?
[245:11.34]The only one with anything useful to contribute is the young lady over there.
[245:14.76]She lives above the bar, name of Shannon Perry.
[245:17.83]No, it's not a stage name.
[245:20.25]24 years old, she left Kansas to follow the yellow brick road.
[245:23.38]Is that so?
[245:24.74]We'll take a formal statement later.
[245:26.32]Right now we're going to take a look around.
[245:27.44]I landed on his face and ended up here.
[245:35.38]Karma struck him from behind.
[245:39.75]I think he's still alive.
[245:48.83]No, he's not.
[245:49.33]He's dead.
[245:51.41]He died.
[245:55.69]ID?
[245:58.68]Lester Patson?
[246:00.68]Dear Mr. Patterson, it is a- What the fuck?
[246:02.88]Hold on, it's a great- It's a great pleasure that I've been acknowledged to receive your application.
[246:10.48]Raised the weekly premium of your life insurance policy from $30,000 to $20,000.
[246:12.47]Where I sent it to you to tell you to lump some payout of Sussie.
[246:19.17]In the event of your Sussie, don't turn the payout of Sussie.
[246:22.33]This new plan secures your nest of Sussie of Sussie of $16,000.
[246:25.29]What the fuck?
[246:27.65]We at the California Fire and Life thank you and we wish you good health and Sussie for the future.
[246:31.42]Okay.
[246:34.68]So this is a life insurance scam.
[246:40.10]Curtis Benson.
[246:42.25]Got a name.
[246:50.49]Holding something?
[246:53.05]No.
[246:55.34]No.
[247:04.64]Money?
[247:06.14]Ooh, he's got money.
[247:07.90]That's not dollars.
[247:10.12]That's different country money.
[247:15.54]Take it off.
[247:18.82]That's like a Switzerland dollar.
[247:22.77]Interesting.
[247:24.03]So he's got Swiss money.
[247:28.79]We can notify next of kin.
[247:31.99]Mr. Pattinson.
[247:32.69]Okay.
[247:39.22]What about in his left hand?
[247:47.82]Nothing.
[247:53.66]Nothing else.
[247:55.48]Let's check his hat.
[247:56.22]What have you got on the victim?
[247:58.30]From all reports, he was intoxicated at the time of the accident.
[248:01.70]I'll know how intoxicated once I've done the autopsy.
[248:04.72]Looking him over now, I'd say he died on impact.
[248:08.07]Yeah, we saw it.
[248:08.43]So, skewered him.
[248:08.75]Okay.
[248:08.85]Check out his hat.
[248:09.49]Nothing of interest.
[248:39.37]Dumb hat.
[248:45.07]Here's a streak of blood.
[248:46.49]You take them really far.
[248:48.85]No.
[248:48.91]Fuck it.
[249:06.48]Point of impact.
[249:07.02]No, that's wrong.
[249:07.54]It's a crime scene, man.
[249:08.30]They tried to break?
[249:09.28]So why would you break?
[249:10.24]Can we, like, harvest his DNA?
[249:36.37]Gum in the trash?
[249:42.33]What about in here?
[249:45.15]Anybody?
[249:47.41]Shrink the star is mental breakthrough.
[249:49.05]Alright, I'll get out of here for this.
[249:55.97]Courtney!
[249:57.49]Come in.
[249:59.30]Have a seat.
[250:01.64]Thanks, Doctor.
[250:03.94]How are you finding working at the clinic?
[250:07.69]Fuck is this guy?
[250:08.13]Treatment can unfortunately be very long-term So many of the patients here are addicts doctor I
[250:31.00]Many of them have been for years, Courtney.
[250:33.95]In the past, these people were condemned to sanatoriums.
[250:37.97]Have a cigarette.
[250:38.91]We can reveal the root of the problem.
[250:41.13]It's too quiet?
[250:42.75]Hold on.
[250:44.11]And until then, they stayed sedated?
[250:48.54]Do I detect a hint of reproach, Courtney?
[250:52.12]I was expecting more, Doctor.
[250:56.92]I'm sorry.
[250:58.64]I don't mean to criticize you.
[251:01.52]Part of being a physician, Courtney, is learning to be patient.
[251:08.32]How is it possible to keep so many of them on their medications, doctor?
[251:13.23]Many of their addictions are illegal.
[251:16.13]Oh, many things in life are gray, Courtney.
[251:19.41]What may on the surface appear to be illegal is actually a benefit to society at large.
[251:25.11]I just blanked in his reading chat.
[251:35.42]Newspapers.
[251:41.22]Patrons.
[251:41.74]Anybody see it?
[251:42.14]Any more clues?
[251:45.64]I'll take the bartender.
[251:46.96]You work the rest of the room.
[251:49.94]It's gotta be more, right?
[251:53.86]Back.
[251:56.48]Now it's too loud.
[251:57.26]Illegal car table.
[252:00.52]So this is why everybody comes to Ray's.
[252:04.12]This is illegal.
[252:06.72]You know, you're all fucked.
[252:18.56]What's back here?
[252:19.16]This alleyway?
[252:20.05]There's something back here, right?
[252:26.53]Play some poker.
[252:28.71]I don't think so.
[252:33.54]It would take a smarter man than me to connect that.
[252:37.25]Why can't you even pick up the bottles?
[252:40.19]They don't do anything.
[252:43.07]They just have them here.
[252:47.01]Optimistic call.
[252:51.00]Maybe I should piss in the bottle.
[252:54.28]See if it holds water.
[252:55.62]Junk.
[253:01.58]I don't think so.
[253:05.68]You sound like you're part of a long-distance phone call.
[253:09.94]Because the microphone I'm using is a piece of shit.
[253:16.82]Now that's interesting.
[253:25.73]Knife covered in blood.
[253:28.05]Could be a steak knife.
[253:29.47]This is a hit-and-run case, Phelps.
[253:31.09]Anyone could have thrown away a kitchen knife.
[253:34.23]In any case, we'll want tech services to scrub the alleyway before they bag the knife.
[253:42.48]Definitely.
[253:44.36]Knife in the trash.
[253:46.06]And that's it.
[253:48.42]We got them all.
[253:48.94]Let's interrogate the witnesses.
[253:53.28]No, no, no, don't press X on this.

[254:54.82]Yeah, that's... That sounds correct.
[254:59.52]Then what happened?
[255:00.65]I saw a car hit that poor man and knock him down the street.
[255:05.81]Okay.
[255:08.59]What kind of car was it?
[255:09.47]What kind of car was it, lady?
[255:10.85]A dark red Lincoln Continental.
[255:14.38]Bullshit.
[255:15.86]It was a Ford F-150 and you know it.
[255:23.16]What was the vehicle?
[255:30.90]Did you see the license plate?
[255:33.32]Only the first three letters, I'm afraid.
[255:37.19]3C8.
[255:40.39]Call in suspect vehicle, Red Lincoln Continental.
[255:42.99]Tell me more about the argument you heard.
[255:45.57]Well, there were two voices.
[255:47.41]A man and a woman.
[255:49.79]That's all.
[255:53.00]Oh, watch with the arm there.
[255:55.30]Ah, she's down.
[255:56.24]Hold on a minute.
[255:58.32]What's going on with that?
[255:59.22]That's a lie.
[256:04.62]Why are you holding out on us, Miss Perry?
[256:07.38]I'm sorry.
[256:07.98]I was hoping to tell my story to the newspaper.
[256:11.32]They all do the same thing.
[256:12.08]I'd like to get my picture in the paper.
[256:13.54]I'm trying to find work as an actress, and things are pretty difficult.
[256:19.07]Cough it up, sister.
[256:20.13]We don't have all night.
[256:22.37]The people arguing?
[256:23.95]They were husband and wife.
[256:25.11]I could tell by what she was yelling.
[256:27.17]Intimate things.
[256:28.63]Very embarrassing for the man.
[256:30.93]Embarrassing.
[256:31.71]Okay.
[256:31.81]Victim's wife.
[256:32.45]God, that's so uncanny.
[256:33.07]You watch it?
[256:33.39]Let's see what it is.
[256:59.33]The Sharpshooter.
[257:00.17]We got the Broderick.
[257:03.03]Sunset Strip.
[257:09.49]I kind of like this one.
[257:11.13]I like this one.
[257:11.59]We're going to go with this one.
[257:13.37]Just change in the middle of the restaurant.
[257:14.82]Who cares?
[257:15.16]I'm Detective Phelps of the LAPD.
[257:19.18]How can I help, Detective?
[257:21.06]Your name would be a good start.
[257:22.50]Dudley Lynch.
[257:23.74]Hired to help.
[257:24.48]I run the place when the owner ain't around.
[257:27.23]Look at me, please.
[257:27.73]Where is the owner?
[257:28.39]Are you talking to me?
[257:29.49]He stepped out.
[257:30.82]Somebody had to take Lorna, Mrs. Patterson, home.
[257:39.12]Bathroom quality mic.
[257:40.62]God damn it.
[257:43.86]Ow, this is in my hair.
[257:46.28]Ow!
[257:50.58]Listen, is it really that bad?
[257:55.50]How am I supposed to... Red Lincoln Continental.
[258:01.86]3CB.
[258:02.34]Insurance letter.
[258:04.28]The wallet has his name in it.
[258:09.44]He was drunk.
[258:12.20]He was arguing.
[258:13.12]Let's see.
[258:13.70]What can you tell me about the accident?
[258:16.78]Not a lot.
[258:17.96]It was busy in here and all I heard was the impact.
[258:20.71]Bullshit.
[258:21.71]They were arguing down here.
[258:22.79]Bullshit.
[258:23.59]They were arguing.
[258:24.27]I don't think that... That's not an untrue statement.
[258:51.80]Not one of your favorite customers?
[258:55.30]Lester was special, but not my kind of special.
[258:59.50]Was Lester drinking alone?
[259:00.66]Uh-oh.
[259:02.38]No.
[259:03.12]He came here with his wife.
[259:05.18]She didn't seem too interested in the booze, though.
[259:08.52]Hmm.
[259:10.68]So what were they arguing about?
[259:11.52]A witness overheard an argument.
[259:14.32]Lester and Lorna.
[259:15.92]There's nothing like airing your dirty laundry in public, is there?
[259:22.42]What was that?
[259:22.82]What was that?
[259:24.98]He knows more about this.
[259:29.20]Yeah, look at him.
[259:29.62]He's fluttering his eyes at me.
[259:31.12]He's giving a little smile.
[259:33.98]Why was Lorna Patterson in such a hurry to leave?
[259:36.92]What is going on here?
[259:38.52]Lorna was pretty upset, so Leroy took her home.
[259:41.23]Who's Leroy?
[259:42.39]Lorna and Leroy are close.
[259:44.59]They've been talking about opening a new bar.
[259:46.59]Leroy.
[259:48.21]Leroy Sabo.
[259:50.21]The owner.
[259:50.83]Got it.
[259:56.05]How long have Lorna and Leeroy been talking about this new bar?
[260:00.81]Who knows?
[260:02.13]I just served the drinks.
[260:07.06]There it is again.
[260:08.52]Is that like this?
[260:10.36]He's doing this.
[260:17.70]Well, I don't know.
[260:20.30]I just served the drinks.
[260:25.77]Why are you doing that?
[260:29.52]Bartenders hear all sorts of things.
[260:31.82]Are you going to tell me, or do we have to start playing rough?
[260:35.58]When Lester was drinking, he treated Lorna like dirt.
[260:38.50]He gambled away all their money.
[260:40.26]Lorna pitched Leroy about the bar.
[260:41.95]I don't know how interested he is.
[260:44.71]Is Leroy doing well?
[260:46.93]Hell no.
[260:48.25]The only thing keeping this place afloat are the poker games.
[260:51.36]Okay.
[260:51.64]Can I use your phone?
[260:52.50]Why do I need to ask?
[260:54.14]I'm an officer of the court.
[261:24.01]Operator, give me dispatch.
[261:28.83]Putting you through now.
[261:32.62]Phelps, batch 1247.
[261:35.98]How can I help, detective?
[261:38.64]I need to run a partial license plate, 3 Charles 8.
[261:41.78]Cross-check possible Lincoln owners.
[261:43.58]Suspect vehicle is a red Lincoln Continental.
[261:47.30]Just a moment, detective.
[261:51.42]Only one possible.
[261:53.86]And Mr. Shelton.
[262:00.66]Mr. Shelton, what are you doing running people over with your car?
[262:07.82]Shelton?
[262:09.54]What's your car doing there, man?
[262:14.70]Shelton residence.
[262:17.56]Let's go.
[262:21.22]No, that's Shelton, not Sheldon.
[262:29.20]You guys got it wrong.
[262:32.54]Alright, get in.
[262:41.80]Thank God they're getting rid of that show.
[262:45.94]Isn't the Big Bang Theory the most popular show in the world right now?
[262:54.57]That's like saying Riot Games is going to stop League of Legends.
[262:59.78]Why would they do that?
[263:01.08]Well, you know, we're going to turn off League of Legends servers.
[263:02.92]Why don't they just stop?
[263:04.52]You know, just feel like it's time.
[263:06.18]Oh no, not the internet, no!
[263:20.40]Don't do it.
[263:21.81]It's trying.
[263:22.55]Oh, that was not good.
[263:23.27]Well, we're getting to that portion of the stream where I started really early to try to beat the time here when this all turns off.
[263:48.58]so we've gone for about four and a half hours now so at least we got to fucking stream if it turns off here it's okay now but it is 7 30 this is what I would have like normally started streaming like 20 30 minutes ago let's go see what happens
[264:14.06]What's this guy doing?
[264:15.52]Leaving town.
[264:15.98]So there's the car.
[264:17.96]It's got a big dent in the front.
[264:18.98]That's the son of a bitch right there.
[264:22.08]William Shelton?
[264:22.88]Yes?
[264:23.54]That actually is Sheldon.
[264:24.80]It doesn't look good, Sheldon.
[264:26.06]You packing your bags and making a run for it?
[264:28.98]You know why we're here.
[264:30.62]Yes.
[264:31.96]The accident.
[264:33.56]We've got witnesses who can put this car at the scene.
[264:36.11]Not to mention the physical damage.
[264:38.37]This is open and shut, Sheldon.
[264:41.08]Oh shit, he threw luggage at me!
[264:43.14]Therefore, he can get away and I can't pull my gun!
[264:45.12]That coward thinks he can run from everything!
[264:55.19]Let's make this quick.
[265:05.09]Run, Sheldon, run!
[265:05.95]No games, Phelps!
[265:06.65]Take this guy out!
[265:10.48]Almost.
[265:10.86]One more.
[265:11.95]Sandwich him.
[265:15.23]Straight or left?
[265:15.83]He's gonna go straight.
[265:16.43]Collapse.
[265:17.73]Motherfucker.
[265:19.19]I just did!
[265:22.25]I just did let him get away.
[265:39.02]Stop!
[265:39.64]Get out of my ear!
[265:41.72]Leave me alone!
[265:42.26]Just let me work, please!
[265:55.01]Come on, you can't... And I hit the guy!
[266:02.32]That's not fair!
[266:03.70]He would have crashed into that guy!
[266:06.78]Freeze.
[266:06.98]What the fuck?
[266:48.50]That coward thinks he can run from everyone.
[267:21.45]He's gone.
[267:23.07]Just fucking restarted.
[267:24.49]God damn it.
[267:25.19]I freaked out.
[267:28.93]What?
[267:29.99]No, no, let it... Where is he?
[267:35.10]He might just show up.
[267:36.16]He's right here.
[267:36.54]I don't have to restart.
[267:38.28]He's fine.
[267:39.48]He's right there.
[267:53.38]We're good.
[267:54.06]Come on, get in front of him.
[267:57.88]He ain't getting in here.
[268:23.03]Let's head into the station.
[268:24.31]Go on, get after him!
[268:25.29]Alright, I give up.
[268:28.84]Hold it right there, Shelton!
[268:30.97]How does a vehicular manslaughter rap sound, Shelton?
[268:34.13]I hit him.
[268:35.13]I admit it.
[268:35.67]I just panicked, but it wasn't my fault.
[268:37.95]What do you mean?
[268:38.63]The guy jumped right out in front of me.
[268:41.35]He came out of nowhere.
[268:42.21]There's nothing I could do about it.
[268:45.25]Why didn't you stop?
[268:47.22]I've had accidents before.
[268:49.52]That's it.
[268:50.36]We're done here.
[268:51.52]The DA is gonna love you.
[268:53.14]They weren't all my fault.
[268:55.37]They pushed him.
[268:56.83]Okay.
[269:24.29]Let's go.
[269:25.63]We got our guy.
[269:26.35]Notify Mrs. Pattinson.
[269:27.21]Are we pulling up five feet?
[269:28.35]Why am I getting out?
[269:52.79]Get back in.
[269:53.65]Get back in the car.
[269:54.73]Oh, yoy, yoy.
[270:00.30]No, fucking idiot.
[270:02.22]There's a crime.
[270:03.60]Hold on.
[270:04.06]Get back in.
[270:05.32]I want to do this crime.
[270:23.81]I want to stop this crime.
[270:25.28]Don't crash once, I dare you.
[270:28.20]Okay.
[270:28.44]Okay.
[270:28.62]How can you be so bad?
[270:31.02]How is this bad?
[270:31.88]I'm just driving around like a dickhead.
[270:53.09]I'm having fun in a drivable video game.
[270:58.74]Oh, and I have to drive perfectly?
[271:00.14]Who cares?
[271:00.80]Like, I don't care about that guy.
[271:03.32]Is he gonna give a shit about the city damage?
[271:06.18]I got 50 million dollars in the bank account.
[271:08.88]Jesus, Cole!
[271:09.60]And at the next junction, you shut your trap.
[271:21.18]So when I get $5,000 taken off my paycheck, I make like a quarter of a million dollars every month as an LAPD police officer.
[271:29.92]Really?
[271:30.78]You think I care?
[271:31.84]Which is more lucrative than I thought.
[271:33.60]So help me, Hannah.
[271:35.86]I think I'd have been there yet.
[271:51.31]What was that?
[271:52.11]What was that?
[271:52.73]Why was that guy doing like a turkey run?
[272:18.44]Now you tell me to look out Army surplus, I don't know what you're talking about.
[272:25.98]We weren't doing nothing.
[272:28.09]I

[272:50.55]I'll show you.
[272:51.63]I'll teach you not to.
[272:53.33]Sir, drop the weapon.
[272:54.63]You've been drinking, sir.
[272:55.69]You don't really want to.

[273:08.73]Put them down.
[273:14.38]Did I get him?
[273:15.22]I got him.
[273:16.20]Where's the other guy?
[273:31.37]Okay.

[273:44.81]Suspects are down.

[273:46.53]An ambulance to 540 West 9th Street.
[273:49.51]It's code 4.
[273:50.91]Notify a supervisor in the corner.
[273:55.14]Robbed three times and then murdered.

[279:26.56]Okay.
[279:27.52]Let's find out what really happened.

[279:35.59]It's police.
[279:45.72]Yes?
[279:46.50]Hello?
[279:47.22]Mrs. Patterson.
[279:49.12]Is this about my husband?
[279:50.42]Mr. Patterson is dead.
[279:51.18]We're investigating the incident, ma'am.
[279:53.54]I see.
[279:54.85]Come in, won't you?
[279:57.66]Have I seen nudity in game yet?
[279:59.40]There's no nudity in this game.
[280:04.09]Can you tell me what happened?
[280:06.27]What's to tell?
[280:07.15]He got hit by a car and now he's dead.
[280:10.57]Huh.
[280:10.87]You don't appear to be too upset about the fact.
[280:14.47]Lester and I met on a furlough in 44.
[280:17.91]Yes, there is.
[280:19.87]Whatever, I'll just fucking delete it.
[280:23.02]I see.
[280:23.88]So you probably did well to stick it out this long.
[280:27.89]What's that supposed to mean, mister?
[280:30.65]I think it's about time you left.
[280:32.37]No, I think it's about time you get questioned.
[280:33.79]I beg your pardon?
[280:34.27]You're going to have to run that one by us again, sister.
[280:37.15]It's okay, Lorna.
[280:40.95]I'm Leroy Sabo.
[280:43.50]Well, well.
[280:44.18]Mr. Leroy.
[280:44.94]Nice to see you're comforting the grieving widow, Mr. Sabo.
[280:48.34]Alright, wise guy.
[280:50.08]Do you have any intelligent questions you would like me to answer?
[280:53.42]You can confirm Mrs. Patterson's story.
[280:56.09]Lester lost at cards.
[280:58.43]He was kind of hard to control when he lost his temper.
[281:02.05]He turned without looking and walked right out in front of the car.
[281:06.32]It wasn't good.
[281:07.84]What's your relationship with Mrs. Pattison, Mr. Sabo?
[281:11.16]We're friends.
[281:12.46]Good friends.
[281:14.12]You expect me to believe that?
[281:16.62]Look, I was filing for divorce.
[281:18.68]Mental cruelty.
[281:20.16]Lester could be a mean son of a bitch.
[281:22.56]Man, that fan ain't even turned on.
[281:24.93]It's on no fan setting.
[281:28.45]That fan's a liar.
[281:31.27]Alright, let's take a look around.
[281:39.08]Hit and run vehicle, dark red Lincoln Continental by that guy.
[281:44.12]Insurance letter was found on his corpse, so somebody wanted the insurance.
[281:50.09]Wall belonging to Lester was on the scene.
[281:52.39]He was drunk.
[281:57.33]There was a bloody knife.
[282:03.06]There was an argument downstairs.
[282:06.84]And there was a possible business partnership between Leroy Sabo and Lorna Patterson.
[282:14.18]Okay, so they have a business partnership here and there was an argument downstairs and there was a knife in the laundry bin.
[282:20.53]Let's go.
[282:21.43]How did the car come to hit Lester?
[282:23.57]He walked straight into the path of an oncoming car.
[282:30.45]Lie.
[282:37.23]Is that what happened?
[282:38.25]I have... I have... Hey, what the fuck do you know?
[282:49.14]Hmm.
[282:49.30]What were you arguing about?
[282:50.33]Come on.
[282:51.21]Like, really?
[283:24.78]I mean, that's not a lie.
[283:25.78]They are.
[283:27.84]Admit it.
[283:28.38]You were baiting him, pushing his buttons.
[283:30.06]We can easily get the full story from the regulars in the bar.
[283:33.44]Alright.
[283:35.11]Lester was playing cards out back.
[283:37.07]He lost, of course, and wanted back in.
[283:39.61]He suggested I earn the money on my back to get a mistake.
[283:43.57]That was the proposition he was putting to his so-called buddies.
[283:46.69]So maybe I was a little angrier than usual.
[283:49.59]And you ran him over with a car.
[283:51.13]Let's just say I took exception to his idea.
[283:58.37]The bartender said that you and Leroy were planning to go into business together.
[284:01.55]Can you explain how you'll get the money to do that?
[284:03.94]I have a little money saved away.
[284:06.04]You're being economical with the truth, Lorna.
[284:10.10]You want to back that up, little man?
[284:22.96]Well, we have a insurance letter here, unfortunately.
[284:27.58]You increased the premium on Lester's life insurance.
[284:31.97]GI insurance policies have a $10,000 payout.
[284:35.53]It was Leroy's idea.
[284:37.59]Lester lived on the edge.
[284:38.65]He was always getting into fights, crack games, pinochle, you name it.
[284:44.09]Turns out it was good advice.
[284:45.53]It speaks to motive and premeditation, Lorna.
[284:48.47]You're forgetting the hit-and-run detective.
[284:52.37]You and Mr. Sabo have an interesting day.
[284:54.88]I'm sure we will, officer.
[284:57.20]Now if you could both just leave.
[284:59.32]You're both under arrest.
[285:00.88]Sorry for your loss.
[285:02.54]I can see what a tough time you're having with all this.
[285:10.61]By the way, I'm gonna use your phone.
[285:12.69]I'm gonna use your fan.
[285:14.95]Hello?
[285:16.73]Call it in.
[285:18.25]Call it in, Charlie.
[285:21.78]What do we have back here?
[285:25.28]We have a little poker table back here.
[285:27.45]Isn't that a little suspicious?
[285:30.53]Operator, give me R&I.
[285:31.73]Putting you through now.
[285:37.65]Phelps badge 1247.
[285:41.32]How can I help, detective?
[285:43.82]Messages for me, please.
[285:44.88]Why does it sound like you're talking under a mattress?
[285:48.36]Message reads, Phelps, see me at Central Morgue immediately.
[285:52.35]Results of the Patterson autopsy.
[285:54.39]Okay.
[285:55.61]Thanks for your help.
[285:59.87]Central Morgue?
[286:00.59]Let's close this thing up.
[286:07.80]Incidental.
[286:08.84]It's never the bottle.
[286:10.54]What about the cup?
[286:12.08]God damn it.
[286:14.02]I've picked up every single bottle you could pick up.
[286:16.64]All of them.
[286:22.25]You know, I don't really feel like talking to you right now.
[286:28.51]Just crack him.
[286:31.89]Alright, let's go to the... He was stabbed with a knife.
[286:37.07]That's what's gonna happen.
[286:44.86]Take us there, friend.
[286:45.50]You drive.
[286:46.34]I need to go over the case notes.
[286:59.53]Blast to Pinwheel.
[287:04.02]Nice made-up bullshit you got going in the stream chat here.
[287:12.75]Pretty good bullshit.
[287:15.21]Hey, can I accuse you guys?
[287:17.85]I wonder what your eyes were moving during when you just said that.
[287:28.19]Yeah, let's see.
[287:28.59]What do you got?
[287:28.91]We can put the driver in front of a judge in less than a week.
[287:32.19]You'd be making a big mistake.
[287:34.09]Run that by me again?
[287:35.01]The victim was dead before the car hit him.
[287:39.06]Two puncture wounds to the right side of the thorax.
[287:42.06]Second puncture reached his heart.
[287:43.48]He got stabbed.
[287:45.34]You're kidding me.
[287:46.44]Been doing this job 23 years, son.
[287:48.88]No one's ever laughed at one of my jokes.
[287:50.86]He was stabbed to death?
[287:52.08]Long, sharp knife.
[287:53.38]Length of a bayonet.
[287:55.62]We found a knife in the alleyway.
[287:57.96]We got him.
[287:58.32]Holy shit.
[287:59.04]Let's bring her in.
[287:59.72]Apprehender.
[287:59.98]Can we take the corner car?
[288:28.00]Alright, get it.
[288:32.72]Back to the residence.
[288:34.94]We got the knife.
[288:38.87]Let's take the hearse.
[288:39.75]Can we put him back here too?
[288:45.77]Do I sound exhausted?
[288:49.18]I'm alright.
[288:52.24]I mean, it's been kind of an exhausting... You're probably talking about the microphone.
[288:55.80]The microphone is a piece of shit.
[289:01.01]I need to do this.
[289:01.63]Of course we do.
[289:10.53]The mic is probably exhausted.
[289:14.31]Yeah, bring the body as evidence and just put it on the counter.
[289:24.24]That guy ran back into my path twice.
[289:30.61]Let's do the side mission first.
[289:34.15]Look to the skies.
[289:35.88]Oh, and I see what you're doing.
[289:48.56]I have become my condemned to parody?
[289:50.99]What do you mean?
[289:53.87]What does that mean?
[289:58.47]Stop doing hit and runs?
[290:01.90]I'm hungry now.
[290:03.86]Okay, the first thing somebody says in chat is what I'm going to eat.
[290:07.68]What am I eating?
[290:09.28]First thing I see.
[290:15.66]Somebody said pizza.
[290:18.30]That's not a bad idea.
[290:19.26]I'm going to get pizza delivered to the house.
[290:21.76]It's going to be great.
[290:29.40]Why doesn't McDonald's deliver?
[290:32.31]You ever think about that?
[290:39.78]Imagine if McDonald's and Burger King delivered.
[290:44.82]I wonder if they'd make a billion dollars.
[290:46.44]I said gamer.
[291:00.26]shut up get the money in the bag yes yes sir hurry the hell up will you come on alright one shot one kill it's goddamn cops careful he's got a gun yep one shot all it takes get out of the way right door left
[291:38.26]He's waiting for me get it get in the car, why would you go so slow?
[291:53.81]Can I shoot out the window
[292:08.15]Alright.
[292:08.79]Roll your window down.
[292:09.69]Ask him to stop.
[292:10.45]Well, I mean, ask him to roll his window down because we have a giant window down.
[292:17.72]Alright.
[292:18.30]What the fuck was that?
[292:21.68]Stop here.
[292:22.62]Making a break for it on foot.
[292:36.72]Why would you get out?
[292:39.12]It's a top down man, why would you get out?
[292:43.93]Why would you get out of the car?
[292:47.89]Hands up!
[292:56.33]He just jumped up.
[292:58.25]He unbuckled his seatbelt and stood up.
[293:01.37]What the fuck are you doing?
[293:06.48]Car 11K to KGPL.
[293:08.18]Bristol Hotel 211 is code 4.
[293:09.94]You must be advised, code 4 at the Bristol Hotel on 8th Street.
[293:14.36]Code 4.
[293:21.37]You know what?
[293:21.73]Just... Let's go get him.
[293:27.41]Can you drive to this one?
[293:28.25]5 George is en route to 496.
[293:32.80]What is it?
[293:39.56]Let's get him.
[293:44.86]Stop in the name of the law.
[293:45.80]You're under arrest.
[293:47.98]Dirtbag.
[293:49.72]Hope that's what I say.
[293:50.36]Hey, we're back.
[294:03.21]This time we're going to arrest you.
[294:04.27]You've spoken to the coroner, Mrs. Patterson.
[294:06.82]He confirmed your husband's cause of death.
[294:08.89]We'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions.
[294:13.25]It wasn't me.
[294:14.76]It was Leroy's idea.
[294:15.92]Leroy stabbed him.
[294:16.72]I had nothing to do with it.
[294:17.60]Where is Leroy now?
[294:19.38]He's in the bedroom.
[294:21.35]You're very good, Lorna.
[294:22.91]Put the gun down, Leroy.
[294:25.69]If you do something stupid now, you don't stand a chance in front of the grand jury.
[294:29.41]Nice of you to give me up, sweetheart.
[294:31.63]All that whispering in my ear telling me how we had to get rid of him.
[294:35.29]How good it could be.
[294:36.49]All the money we could claim.
[294:38.71]All that planning.
[294:39.73]How to get him into the street.
[294:41.71]How to make it look like an accident.
[294:43.25]For God's sake, Leroy, shut up.
[294:44.07]You had all the bases covered, baby.
[294:45.85]I had nothing to do with it.
[294:46.65]You think I'm going to fry for you, Lola?
[294:48.65]He's a crazy man.
[294:49.77]Shoot him.
[294:50.99]Shoot him for God's sake.
[294:54.09]It's too late, Sabo.
[294:57.69]Chasing.
[294:58.09]Alright, here we go.
[294:59.94]Freeze.
[295:09.14]I walked on that guy's back.
[295:14.19]Oh, my head.
[295:15.41]I have a fucking headache.
[295:17.97]Oh, shit.
[295:23.11]Oh, come on.
[295:30.54]Come on.
[295:31.38]I got to get close enough and aim the reticle on him.
[295:35.86]Where is he?
[295:41.12]You stay back.
[295:42.75]I like this one.
[295:43.71]I don't care.
[295:45.69]Put the weapon down now.
[295:53.65]Sometimes you gotta act.
[295:54.41]You know what I mean?
[296:00.22]You look spooked, Phelps.
[296:02.04]I thought you'd been under fire before.
[296:05.52]Put that cookie down!
[296:07.42]No!
[296:16.58]He's done.
[296:17.26]We got him.
[296:23.02]I think that's a solid... 8 out of 10.
[296:27.69]So I give you a hit and run.
[296:29.45]You bring me back fraud, conspiracy, and first degree murder.
[296:33.67]This is how a good detective operates, Phelps.
[296:36.83]You take nothing at face value.
[296:38.89]You keep digging and asking questions until you get to the truth.
[296:42.91]You got some sharp elbows on you, detective.
[296:45.09]I like that.
[296:46.47]Keep up the good work.
[296:50.58]See?
[296:51.00]I got congratulated.
[296:56.97]nine out of nine ten out of ten just it was pretty good except for the the money is it alright case closed slip of the tongue so I think
[297:26.62]Because I... Like I told you guys earlier in the stream... No!
[297:38.68]So, okay, so... I have to get going on my place.
[297:44.28]Somebody's buying it.
[297:45.62]Bound out today.
[297:48.11]And I have to do the necessary things to be ready for it.
[297:51.37]Here comes the voice where he says... Okay, so this is... Alright, so here we go.
[297:56.29]The end of the stream voice.
[297:58.14]Okay, guys.
[297:58.92]So... I swear to them.
[298:05.46]Going for about five hours.
[298:07.80]Probably by the end of the bits, we'll be about six.
[298:12.31]This is great.
[298:12.85]I'm having a blast.
[298:14.35]So we're just going to play L.A.
[298:15.43]Noire again.
[298:15.83]I don't know why we wouldn't play it again.
[298:20.35]The schedule for the next week...
[298:26.30]we'll probably end up going because I have to be around tomorrow.
[298:30.27]So Wednesday, so Thursday, this Thursday, you are going to see me again with LA Noire.
[298:42.10]And then Friday, we'll probably do LA Noire again.
[298:49.12]And then at that point,
[298:52.06]I'm going to lose my internet.
[298:56.34]My internet is scheduled to turn off, because obviously I'm leaving, on the 28th of the 29th.
[299:04.60]But, I told you this before, there are at least two streams here that are not going to require internet at this location.
[299:15.37]I have two planned streams.
[299:19.14]Even when the internet turns off here, there's still two fairly major streams that are going to happen.
[299:29.36]Don't you need to schedule it to turn off?
[299:30.58]Yeah.
[299:30.74]I mean, I, I, I essentially it's the next payment period, which ends here on the 30th.
[299:36.98]So I'm going to try to get as many in as I can Thursday, Friday, maybe Saturday, but Saturday might be something else.
[299:46.91]I'm not going to play Oblivion again until I get my setup.
[299:49.68]Because that was unbearable.
[299:52.64]I cannot use keyboard and mouse at this setup.
[299:55.02]It's just not possible.
[299:56.24]After like two hours, I can't even move.
[299:59.54]It hurts.
[300:01.48]So we're going to do L.A.
[300:02.96]Noire for the next day.
[300:05.05]Maybe the next two streams, but maybe we'll just finish L.A.
[300:06.99]Noire.
[300:07.21]Then you're going to see the green screen stream.
[300:10.91]I want to do an iPad stream where we play a bunch of fucked up iPad games.
[300:15.48]And then there's another stream right before I leave.
[300:22.52]How are the streams going to work if I don't have internet?
[300:24.06]Because I'm going to be somewhere else where internet exists.
[300:31.92]So don't worry about that.
[300:36.19]Anywho, I'm going to call it here.
[300:42.34]Not McDonald's.
[300:43.82]It's not going to be a McDonald's stream.
[300:45.90]Not a McDonald's Wi-Fi stream.
[300:51.30]So let's get to the credits.
[300:56.88]Thanks everybody for sticking around.
[300:57.92]I hope you had a good time.
[300:59.66]I will see you guys on Thursday if you're taking off.
[301:05.51]I need to do this though.
[301:08.65]Just give me a second.
[301:10.17]I don't know why this doesn't keep saving.
[301:13.79]This should be saving.
[301:15.05]It's not.
[301:17.91]But yeah, see you Thursday.
[301:19.39]Same time.
[301:19.85]I'm probably going to start somewhere in the late afternoon.
[301:23.47]Maybe, I don't know, we'll keep it at 7 just to make it easy.
[301:27.82]You know what I mean?
[301:29.68]Just to make it easy.
[301:35.98]So here come the subs.

[304:19.24]Thank you guys.
[304:20.46]Thank you for your subscriptions.
[304:21.46]I appreciate it.
[304:51.12]That just proved that I have dyslexia.
[304:52.77]No, that just proved that reading lowercase everything is impossible.
[304:57.27]When you read a sentence that is all lowercase with no capitalization and no punctuation, like that's what that is.
[305:05.72]If your name is like Steven Spielberg, Jurassic Park, and it's an all lowercase, there's no break in language there.
[305:13.54]It's just a fucking bunch of letters.
[305:20.51]Anyways.
[305:24.57]Whoops.
[305:26.89]Thank you, guys.
[305:34.82]Local streamer confused by letters.
[305:38.10]I did not dab.
[305:38.98]I didn't dab.
[305:39.98]I didn't dab at all.
[305:41.74]Don't put words in my mouth.
[305:43.54]Don't put words in my hair.
[305:45.84]Anywho, I probably should just keep this on, shouldn't I?
[305:50.27]Get this off.

[307:14.00]Can you guys hear this?
[307:16.02]No, you can't.
[307:18.30]I don't know why you can't hear it.
[307:26.74]I mean, it should be working.
[307:36.61]So I don't know why that's not coming through desktop audio.
[307:41.89]That should be coming through desktop audio, but it's not.
[307:45.57]We can hear it on your mic.
[307:51.18]I think it's because I had to use.

[309:52.06]Don't worry.
[309:55.07]Thank you for even considering sticking around in the first place.
[309:58.71]Thank you, Kvas.

[310:46.74]Thanks for the $2 here, Wispied.
[310:48.16]No message.
[310:48.62]Thank you, man.
[310:50.79]Tar Alecran, thanks for the three bucks.
[310:53.59]I have a theory.
[310:54.35]I have a theory that Jerma is not actually moving.
[310:59.87]Okay, let's see what this is.
[311:01.47]Moving to Vegas is code for his enormous gambling debts.
[311:04.85]The room is empty because he's pawned everything to get the mob off his back.
[311:07.83]The internet quality is worse than usual because he can't afford it.
[311:11.25]He's at his wit's end.
[311:13.67]Becoming more violent, even to the point of punching us.
[311:16.25]The facts are all there.
[311:17.51]He will try to deny it, but he needs serious psychological help.
[311:25.89]You think I got a fucking gambling problem?
[311:30.19]What's the closest book on the ground here?
[311:32.33]That's bringing down the house.
[311:33.25]That's a gambling book.
[311:43.83]One of these days I'm going to accidentally do that and it's going to happen again.
[311:46.79]Whatever.
[311:47.63]It's your opinion.
[311:49.13]And guess what?
[311:50.96]Everybody's allowed to have one.
[312:14.06]Thanks for the bro fist.
[312:21.33]Thank you, Sir Rocky.
[312:22.37]Appreciate it.
[312:22.81]Thank you, Topac, for the five bucks.
[312:25.49]Five dollars from Topac.
[312:27.37]I can't believe you pulled this off.
[312:28.49]You looked like a total schmuck.
[312:31.36]What did I do?
[312:42.40]Why are you gnoming me?
[312:43.94]I'm just getting gnomed by my own face.
[312:47.78]That's all that is.
[312:51.65]I was getting gnomed before people were getting gnomed by my own face.
[312:55.19]I'm just realizing this right now.
[312:57.81]Thank you, Topec.
[312:59.09]Thank you, Snoozencopter, for the $1.
[313:01.79]This is a little nostalgic.
[313:03.17]Honestly, no opening, ending, or BRB screen.
[313:06.03]The audio quality and all that.
[313:08.07]It has a lot of charm.
[313:09.53]It's comfortable.
[313:12.74]Like this shitty mic and me being in a basement empty with a card table.
[313:19.50]Thank you.
[313:23.28]I'll never have more than this webcam quality right here.
[313:26.96]This is the highest quality you're ever going to see.
[313:29.68]At any time I do a face cam.
[313:31.88]Some people set up the DSLRs and... No, I don't want you to see my pores and shit when I'm sitting here.
[313:37.48]I don't want you to see my nose hairs.
[313:39.44]You think I want that?
[313:40.28]Absolutely not.
[313:42.41]Oh, my eye.
[313:43.31]I didn't get you.
[313:47.11]Now I got you.
[313:50.62]Right here.
[313:51.04]Close your eyes.
[313:52.24]Don't open them.
[313:54.60]Ooh, that fucking hurt.
[313:58.38]Long fingernails?
[314:00.68]What are you talking about?
[314:02.91]Long fingernails.
[314:05.87]Where are you looking at here?
[314:10.42]Where do you see that?
[314:12.41]These are perfectly cuticled fingers.
[314:18.67]I'm like a snake, man.
[314:20.03]You notice that?
[314:21.35]Holy shit, he's so fast.
[314:22.47]Like, look at how much of a snake I am.
[314:25.41]Like, the snake is up here.
[314:27.42]Don't fuck with him.
[314:30.46]You see?
[314:30.74]I just fucking took your eye out.
[314:35.44]Okay, I need this, so don't break it.
[314:41.92]Thank you, though, SnoozyCopter.
[314:42.94]Thank you to SirRocky again for the $1.
[314:46.81]He says, nipples.
[314:53.51]You look at it.
[314:53.92]These are shadows.
[314:54.86]These are shadows shining down on us.
[315:02.08]Whatever.
[315:05.33]Baked Flakes gave $50 earlier.
[315:06.93]Just touch upon it again.
[315:07.67]Thank you so much, Baked Flakes.
[315:08.95]Hopefully your teeth situation gets better.
[315:12.67]And hopefully you don't have any drugs soon.
[315:17.09]Because that's... You don't want to be on drugs for that for too long.
[315:22.98]Best of luck to you.
[315:23.80]Good luck on your recovery.
[315:25.26]For your wisdom teeth being removed.
[315:27.78]Killcode, thanks for the $1.
[315:29.20]Hey, Jerma, I haven't given this in a while because I got fired.
[315:32.50]But I did make this video for you and I hope you like it.
[315:35.85]I'm sorry to hear that, dude.
[315:39.04]That sucks.
[315:42.16]I hope you figure out a new career or a new job soon.
[315:46.62]But don't worry about giving me bits.
[315:50.38]Again, let me make this really fucking clear.
[315:53.36]Take care of you first.
[315:55.62]You need to take care of yourself first.
[315:58.70]If you have money, you have disposable income, make sure that you are fucking good to go before you give a cent to me.
[316:05.52]I should be, like... Here's a list of things that matter.
[316:10.16]Right?
[316:10.42]Like, I should be somewhere down here.
[316:13.38]Because I want to make sure that you're taken care of.
[316:16.76]Don't worry about me.
[316:17.72]Don't worry about apologizing for not giving me money.
[316:21.87]It means a lot, you even attempting and even being here in the first place.
[316:25.35]Do not worry about that.
[316:28.77]But thank you, though.
[316:29.47]And here's a video.
[316:30.27]We got a video here. ...
[316:43.23]What is it?
[316:43.53]I don't know what this is.
[317:00.69]That's kind of a cute video.
[317:01.71]It's like a little gnome with a hat on.
[317:04.40]That's cute.
[317:07.41]I bet you that, you know, that looks like it could get pretty popular if somebody just sent it to somebody else.
[317:12.99]It's called being, it's called being gnomed.
[317:16.95]I could see that being kind of fun and popular.
[317:19.59]That's so cute.
[317:20.50]Wow.
[317:22.36]I hope you send it to me every fucking five minutes.
[317:25.54]It's so cute.
[317:34.32]He's breaking the fourth wall.
[317:35.74]He's breaking the fourth wall.
[317:46.94]Thank you, Pocket Pauling, for the 50 cents.
[317:48.42]50 cents.
[318:00.00]It was $50, okay?
[318:02.54]$50 from pocket-polling.
[318:04.44]Thank you so much, pocket-polling, for the $50.
[318:07.44]We touched upon it already, but thank you so fucking much.
[318:12.11]It's a lot of money, dude.
[318:14.61]Bakeflakes and pocket-polling came back-to-back here with $50.
[318:18.33]And then, I didn't even see this, but Atrolux... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...
[318:25.88]10 gifted subs from Atrolux Aatrox.
[318:29.68]Thank you.
[318:31.80]Thank you so much, Atrolux, for your 10 fucking community subs.
[318:38.61]You gave some random people got them tonight, so thanks a lot, man.
[318:44.11]Also, Soraki again for $1.
[318:46.71]He's so bad at video games, it's sad.
[318:49.53]What's with you?
[318:51.57]Why do you have it out for me with this whole bad at video games thing?
[318:56.14]Don't.
[318:56.82]I'll do it.
[318:57.22]Why do you have to be so mean about it?
[319:04.22]I just got a 9 out of 10, 10 out of 10.
[319:06.82]And I got the guy in one shot.
[319:11.12]Huh?
[319:15.38]I just have 9 out of 10.
[319:16.40]9 out of 9 and 10 out of 10.
[319:20.70]Don't tap the glass.
[319:21.72]Why?
[319:21.97]A little lizard in there?
[319:28.00]You failed the... You failed the trailing mission three times.
[319:33.06]Yeah, but I was like just... I was... I was... What did I do wrong?
[319:37.49]I was fucking chasing the guy.
[319:39.03]What?
[319:39.25]I was looking at the chat room and we were having a chat over here.
[319:43.95]Why are you... He's a reptilian streamer.
[319:51.29]One of these days the skins... I'm just... The skins coming off.
[319:54.14]And like I'm just... It's going to be me as like the fucking reptile overlord.
[320:01.75]I'm not gonna.
[320:02.59]I shouldn't say that because there are probably people that think that's real.
[320:07.05]No, no, no.
[320:08.07]Look at my eyes, right?
[320:09.74]If you look at my eyes, can't you look at somebody's eyes and if they blink sideways, it means they're a reptile?
[320:14.44]Just look.
[320:15.88]We'll try it.
[320:16.28]We'll do it right here.
[320:18.08]See?
[320:18.38]Ready?
[320:23.86]Nothing.
[320:29.44]It is real.
[320:33.28]Thank you.
[320:35.58]Thank you to... Thank you Sir Rocky again.
[320:39.50]He's just being mean to me.
[320:42.96]All I ever said about Sir Rocky is that he's a really fun, cool dude.
[320:46.56]And he's a really nice guy and I wish him the best.
[320:51.89]Thank you Sir Rocky.
[320:53.91]Atrolux, thank you again for $3.50.
[320:54.89]Atrolux after giving 10 community subs there.
[320:59.97]This isn't a fucking gnome.
[321:08.26]Yeah, we just watched this one.
[321:16.36]No, I know it's not.
[321:17.64]We just looked at it.
[321:19.44]There's probably a gnome at the end of it, though.
[321:22.94]But thank you, Atulux, for the $3.50.
[321:24.46]My good friend had a super stressful day today, so this early EU stream helped him.
[321:28.63]Thank you, Jerbo.
[321:30.07]Say something encouraging.
[321:33.54]Uh, I'm sorry to hear about your super stressful day.
[321:35.40]Uh, I can join you in that, uh, in that pool of stress because it's been kind of a ball of it the last five or six days.
[321:47.01]So I hope you feel a lot better.
[321:50.35]Hope it gets better.
[321:55.98]Take care, uh, whoever your friend is at your Lux.
[322:01.48]Did I bring the giant CRT TV?
[322:03.12]No, that's gone.
[322:04.89]I can't bring that.
[322:07.23]You fell asleep during this stream?
[322:11.49]Let me just take care of your window here.
[322:12.81]Let me just take care of your window.
[322:20.12]There.
[322:26.76]Really?
[322:26.98]Okay.
[322:27.37]Okay.
[322:38.21]Your breath stinks.
[322:41.43]I thought the TV was going back again.
[322:43.73]I thought the whole thing was coming down.
[322:52.64]But thank you, Atrolux.
[322:53.46]Thank you, DivUSP for the $6.

[323:07.63]1-0-0, 100 bucks from General Arce.
[323:12.99]Thank you so much.
[323:14.79]It means a lot.
[323:17.55]0-0-1.
[323:17.89]I know that it's a blinking red light.
[323:20.35]There's nothing wrong with it.
[323:22.15]It's there to prevent the ghosts.
[323:23.47]It's a ghost meter.
[323:25.33]Every time it blinks, it means a ghost walks by.
[323:27.19]It detects them.
[323:27.85]And it hasn't blinked one time.
[323:29.27]Guys, relax.
[323:32.45]Thank you, SorakiQ, again, for $1.

[327:58.45]What would you do if while Kim was talking to you, she short-circuited and her face opened up, revealing she was being piloted by an alien like Men in Black?
[328:13.44]I would rip out the hard drive.
[328:17.20]I'd be like, I want that fucking hard drive.
[328:20.61]I don't care.
[328:20.99]I won't say it.
[328:21.49]The goddamn thing.
[328:22.15]Give me that hard drive.
[328:25.25]That one time when I told you like my favorite fucking popsicle and my favorite food and shit.
[328:28.27]I don't want anybody to know that.
[328:29.81]Rip out that fucking hard drive.
[328:33.88]Then I would call an exorcist from me.
[328:40.20]Like, think about that.
[328:41.40]Like, if you're, like, a robot, you can take pictures with your eyes.
[328:44.81]You can just be like, right?
[328:47.77]So how many pictures of my, like, naked ass?
[328:50.79]No, give me that.
[328:51.23]I want that hard drive.
[328:51.99]You know how many times Kim has, like, walked into me when I'm just in the shower asking me questions?
[328:57.55]About, hey, like, where are we getting dinner tonight?
[328:59.87]And I'm just naked in the shower.
[329:01.14]And she, like, is just looking at me.
[329:02.24]You know how many pictures that could have been?
[329:03.66]That's, like, 500,000 pictures of me naked.
[329:06.14]No, I want that fucking HDD.
[329:08.86]Or if it's SD, if it's a fucking higher end model.
[329:20.19]That's just what I would do.
[329:23.59]You don't wear clothes in the shower sometimes.
[329:26.28]If I'm lazy.
[329:27.32]I don't.
[329:28.68]I don't do that.
[329:30.88]Hey, thank you too.

[331:58.82]If you go to the video producer in Twitch, there's a list of VODs.
[332:02.53]If you click the highlight button next to a VOD and set the length to be the entire VOD, it will bypass the 60-day limit and never be deleted, along with the chat.
[332:15.11]Might be something to consider for more high-effort streams.
[332:19.88]That's actually a really good idea.
[332:22.56]I will absolutely have to start doing that, especially with ones that I do not want to get deleted.
[332:28.36]Thank you for the tip.
[332:29.32]Appreciate it.
[332:29.70]And thanks for the $1.
[332:31.70]Garfield, the Monday killer gave $1.
[332:33.06]Uh, Odie and I told you we needed this shot by a Wednesday.
[332:37.60]Why is it not done?
[332:39.34]If we missed the deadline and the studio is going to be on our tails and we're already over budget.
[332:44.26]I expect the shot to be done by yesterday.
[332:46.00]Hey, you're sorry.
[332:48.35]I had to see what making movies.
[332:50.93]What's what shot?
[332:51.59]What happened?
[332:51.99]What are you talking about?
[332:54.87]What happened?
[332:58.13]Well, I gotta give you a shot.
[332:59.49]Like you're talking about like one of these.
[333:07.42]Like this.
[333:09.18]I gotta get it in the right spot though.
[333:10.34]Hold on.
[333:13.26]Like here's a close up.
[333:17.78]There you go.

[333:51.61]So you can't see.
[333:55.75]Then he gives another dollar and says for the foundation to show the female organ that's up here on stream.
[334:04.57]Whatever.
[334:04.89]I don't think I'm going to be doing that.
[334:07.39]I don't know.

[335:06.60]What is this?
[335:10.47]Is this a dick?
[335:14.37]Is this what it is?
[335:15.61]That's not what it is, right?
[335:21.07]Is that what that is?
[335:24.08]I don't know.
[335:24.64]I'm afraid.
[335:27.30]Yeah, I just sniffled a little bit.
[335:28.18]Sorry about that.
[335:28.76]Thank you, though, Sazasoft, for your contribution to the Discord there.
[335:34.06]It's the whole solar system.
[335:36.63]I'm so paranoid.
[335:37.69]Wait, is this a dick?
[335:39.41]Is it a dick?
[335:44.23]Thank you, though.
[335:44.77]Thank you, VR Josh, for the $5, VR Josh.
[335:47.27]Hey, Jeremiah, I recreated some Twitch emotes in Tilt Brush VR.
[335:53.10]What is that?
[335:57.67]What the hell?
[335:59.69]Okay, that's cool.
[336:05.57]Take a look at that.
[336:08.35]I need to get a Vive, man.
[336:09.61]I keep, like, buying green screen space whenever I feel like buying one.
[336:15.71]That looks like fun.
[336:17.93]But... Thank you.
[336:20.75]Thank you, VR Josh.
[336:21.79]VR is in your name.
[336:22.85]That makes some sense now, doesn't it?
[336:24.89]Take a look at that dude.
[336:26.08]Thank you for the $5.
[336:28.26]topac thanks for five dollars as well did you move your entire furniture including your ceiling light bulbs uh there's there's two that are here that are they're not there two there two missing so there are and those are nice ones remember I remember I had the ones the ones that change color those things were expensive those weren't like five bucks so yeah I packed them up and I shipped them out so I did you're right
[336:58.36]Uh, Jess homeboy, thanks for the $1 asking for your professional opinion.
[337:02.13]I want to go to film school for directing or cinematography, but have been repeatedly told that it'll be a big waste of money, but I feel there's no better chance for networking.
[337:09.87]What do I say?
[337:12.81]Um, that's a tough question because the thing about the film and movie industry that you have to remember is
[337:24.53]If you let, okay, let, like, this is what I did and it's kind of, uh, I got kind of annoyed and sick of the whole process.
[337:33.16]But when you start, you go to film school, you get like a film degree and you're like, Oh, I'm a derived, but I have a directing degree, right?
[337:41.57]The only thing you're going to get to be able to do on a movie set is they pick up trash.
[337:48.12]Like you'll just be a PA and that's what I did, right?
[337:51.68]So I went to school for mass media.
[337:53.14]I wanted to be like, I wanted to make films and movies and TV shows.
[337:56.61]And out of college, you're just a PA and you get PA, PA, PA, PA.
[338:03.05]Yes, you can network at those places.
[338:04.77]And yes, it's actually pretty effective.
[338:06.07]There was a lot of people that I met doing that, but you have to be ready to like actually just like take out trash cans and like clean up after sets and stuff like that.
[338:14.28]I did it on like four or five different movies.
[338:17.46]Um,
[338:19.18]But if you can do that and you're okay with kind of swallowing your pride a little bit, then there is an opportunity to network because there were a lot of people that were like, oh yeah, yeah, I'll give you a reference.
[338:29.02]Oh yeah, sure.
[338:29.60]Like we're working on a new project.
[338:31.35]If you can get, if you can become a PA on a set, then a lot of stuff can kind of work out for you.
[338:39.89]But what movies?
[338:45.65]No, you're not, you don't get that.
[338:49.14]Superman 1, Superman 2, Superman 3, Return of Superman, Superman Man of Steel, Batman vs. Superman, Superman... Smallville, the new Superman.
[339:03.03]Who do you think was Superman in those fucking movies, guys?
[339:08.33]They know me for this long, and they've watched me for this long, they don't even know that I'm in the Superman movies as Mr. Superman?
[339:13.95]God...
[339:22.85]No, but actually, real talk there.
[339:25.67]It's like the hardest industry in the world.
[339:28.21]It's incredibly difficult to... You kind of need to... With the rise of YouTube and Twitch and independent film, you don't really need to do that shit anymore, right?
[339:41.99]If you can make something that people will watch...
[339:44.82]It's a completely different world now.
[339:47.66]It's not like, Oh wait, I have to like, I have to work my way all the way up the chain here and I have to get to the top and then I can make a movie.
[339:54.10]I mean, you can, you can make a movie right now and put it on YouTube and you know, if it gets people watch it, you know, 5,000, 10,000, a hundred thousand views, something like that.
[340:02.24]That's how you can get started.
[340:05.50]Like look, even like in the, not just film careers, look at like music careers.
[340:10.46]How many music careers have been started in the last decade because they had a YouTube channel and they had like a popular, well, that person got big on YouTube and now they're like an artist now.
[340:21.24]It's a lot of people.
[340:23.50]It's very untraditional now.
[340:25.18]SoundCloud, exactly.
[340:26.56]SoundCloud, YouTube, Instagram.
[340:29.24]People are doing untraditional ways to become media personalities and media, just getting into media in general.
[340:39.45]You don't need to be on a movie set now to network with somebody.
[340:45.87]But advice wise, it's, it's hard to give that advice because the world is changing so rapidly that it's not like, well, here's how this is, this is exactly what you have to do.
[340:53.68]And that's what you need to be.
[340:54.70]I mean, you'll gain some knowledge from being in film school, but then again, a lot of stuff that you will learn, you can just get a book and read it yourself.
[341:06.51]You know what I mean?
[341:07.37]There's a lot of things that unless you have like an apprenticeship with a very, very, you know, you went to like, for instance, there's a school around here called Emerson, which is a film school.
[341:16.82]And there's a lot of prestigious people that teach there.
[341:23.41]But it's not necessarily something that's absolutely necessary because we're so connected at this point that you can do all that if you really want to on your own.
[341:35.53]How do you get to be big at Fortnite?
[341:38.37]That's, dude, the boogie bomb, man.
[341:40.49]You gotta drop that and make everybody dance and then like, you know, one of those.
[341:53.80]What does a boogie bomb do?
[341:56.44]I don't know what it is.
[342:03.37]What does it do?
[342:06.59]I pretty much got it.
[342:07.75]Okay.
[342:08.83]I was pretty certain of it.
[342:12.74]But remember, like, it...
[342:16.02]You'll learn other shit in college.
[342:17.92]Like people think that, oh, I'm going to go to college and I'm going to learn this.
[342:22.47]That's not the only fucking thing you're going to learn.
[342:24.49]I guarantee it.
[342:24.91]You're going to learn how to take care of yourself, how to live on your own, be on your own, make friends, do other shit.
[342:33.85]You will like absorb so much more knowledge than just the X, Y, Z of courses that you do in college.
[342:40.74]There's so much more that you end up learning just as a big growing up as a person.
[342:47.75]Make friends.
[342:49.01]In college, you surround yourself with people that, you know, that are like you, think alike you, and do the same things that you do.
[343:03.30]You had student loans too?
[343:04.36]Oh, yeah.
[343:05.92]Well, that's why, like, I mean, not to get political or anything, but we're about to.
[343:10.57]I mean, college is, it's hard to go to college now.
[343:18.63]You know, even when I was in school, it was like, I went to school during the recession.
[343:26.18]I graduated college.
[343:28.46]the year that the recession started.
[343:30.87]And it was just, well, now what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[343:34.29]You know what I mean?
[343:35.97]We're given this notion and this knowledge that, hey, you know, you go to school, it's like fucking an absolute shitload of money to go, and then, alright, time to get out of college, and here you go.
[343:49.62]Go to work, baby.
[343:51.10]And it's like, where?
[343:54.96]What?
[343:55.94]It's like, what am I supposed to do?
[343:59.41]And this has nothing to do with, like, Democrat or Republican.
[344:04.89]This is just common knowledge that it's hard to get work, especially right out of college.
[344:12.56]This has nothing to do with any, like, partisan politics or policies.
[344:15.10]This is just a statement.
[344:16.80]That's a true statement.
[344:17.76]It's hard to do that.
[344:22.88]That's an odd door.
[344:25.70]I mean, whatever.
[344:26.22]That's why I keep my firewood.
[344:33.40]Straight up, yeah, we're just talking, this is my personal experience, right?
[344:40.05]And it's, you know, we got to make sure that everyone's ready.
[344:43.65]You know, it's one thing just to give a piece of paper that costs fucking $148,000, but then what?
[344:49.56]Like programs to, I think like earn to internships.
[344:56.79]There should be more, almost like a company and product assimilation with people and getting people like work after college, then there should be more, oh yeah, go to school and get the paper.
[345:10.88]I think that we'd be doing more of a service to our younger generation if we help them after college.
[345:18.60]And there was programs that people could do after college and they do exist, but they already do stuff like that, but only for certain programs.
[345:32.95]But regardless, to answer to hopefully that long-winded remark answered any of your questions, you'd vote for me?
[345:49.17]Look, if I was in office, it would be sound, reasonable reasoning.
[345:54.01]It would be about reason.
[345:55.17]It would be about...
[345:56.89]Just critical thinking it wouldn't be just about like what you thought or what you thought it'd be like what the goddamn best thing for our fucking students What do you have to say what's that oh all that what did you have to say and what's the best thing for our students It's a bad story this is the end there's no this stream is over I
[346:28.11]Wow, so insightful.
[346:38.99]Oh, my God.
[346:42.62]Bad stream.
[346:44.42]What?
[346:45.50]We're just, like, chilling and talking.
[346:46.88]We're just chilling, man.
[346:48.84]God.
[346:57.53]Anyways.
[347:00.42]I'm not, I don't have any solutions for you.
[347:02.76]I can just tell you my personal experience.
[347:04.15]It was very difficult to get a job out of college.
[347:06.61]So I know what that's like to have a bunch of fucking money that you have to owe and you might not have a job or it might be too much money.
[347:16.75]I just, I know what that's like because I still have student loans that I'm still paying at 33.
[347:25.66]How did we get on this?
[347:32.05]Is somebody behind me?
[347:34.99]Get out of here!
[347:37.36]I scared him away, don't worry.
[347:40.28]Uh, anyways, we're almost done.
[347:46.86]Uh, thank you Tordungle for the $1.
[347:48.43]I'm sure you've already seen this before, but I love this fucking video so much.
[347:51.13]Alright, let's see what it is.

[348:07.58]Hold on.
[348:10.56]I don't understand this.
[348:11.36]I didn't see this show.

[348:37.37]What the fuck did I just watch?
[348:39.55]What the fuck was that?
[349:04.01]I guess.
[349:04.45]I don't understand.
[349:08.01]Here you go.
[349:09.77]Here, go give it a look.
[349:15.69]I wish I had any context of what that was.

[352:01.46]You understand?
[352:10.14]Hey Johnny, Nathaniel Jones, thanks for the $1.
[352:12.97]I gave 200 bits yesterday but the stream had bad internet and you missed me.

[353:05.36]uh sticks renegade thanks for the one dollar Jerma says you can go straight and left on a red light but not right thanks Jerma I'm in the middle of getting my license and this is the best advice I've ever given uh living in Rhode Island the state known for the worst drivers I'm going to be the best with your tips dude um I'm not a financial advisor
[353:23.63]Literally nothing I say on this stream is legally binding.
[353:26.97]Because there's a disclaimer that you click on before you come to the stream and it pops up.
[353:31.78]It says literally nothing this guy says is legally binding.
[353:35.96]He can say anything he wants as long as it's within a certain jurisdiction and a certain legality.
[353:41.84]Nothing he says ever should take as value.
[353:46.33]You should take it as with a grain of salt.
[353:48.97]That's what it says.
[353:49.57]Everyone had to click on it, so...
[353:52.24]I'm sorry, man.
[353:52.74]I think I'm not a financial advisor.
[353:54.18]Nothing I say is legally upholding into a court of system.
[353:59.14]Sorry, Kadudin.
[353:59.86]I'm sorry.
[354:03.14]Thank you, Sticked Renegade, though.
[354:04.64]Thank you, Stevie Doodle, again, for the $1.
[354:05.94]Here's another dollar.
[354:07.60]Bit dumbass.
[354:13.06]Had something in my eye.
[354:16.00]Thank you, Dr. Frohman, for the $1.
[354:19.05]Hoping the move to Vegas goes smoothly.
[354:20.47]Can't wait to see even bigger and better things in the future.
[354:22.39]I remember hearing your ideas about blending interactivity and traditional entertainment, and I honestly think you could revolutionize the medium.
[354:30.09]No lie.
[354:30.59]Keep it up.
[354:32.19]We'll see.
[354:34.67]We will see if it is a success or not.
[354:38.43]Could go either way.
[354:40.01]I'm willing to try.
[354:40.61]Thank you so much.
[354:43.57]Dr. Froman, appreciate it.

[355:12.51]I mean, I just said it.
[355:15.73]I don't know how true that is.
[355:16.79]Remember, I'm not a financial advisor.
[355:18.33]Nothing I say here should be held up in court of... You can watch.
[355:25.94]Just rewind like 30 seconds.
[355:27.20]You'll hear it.
[355:28.64]Thank you, though.
[355:29.14]My sister is in the room and apparently there.
[355:31.92]Thank you, Rajasil, for the $1.
[355:33.27]I remember ages ago a guy donated and recommended this website called Liarbird.
[355:38.25]But due to Comcast or something, unfortunately, the stream ended before you could see it.
[355:42.31]It's basically a website where you read out a bunch of lines into your mic and it generates a text-to-speech of a voice for you, of your voice.
[355:49.78]I have heard of this.
[355:51.78]And I probably will use it.
[355:55.28]It sounds like fun.
[355:57.04]And then I would have it just stream.
[355:59.58]I would not even be on camera.
[356:03.29]I think you have to, don't you have to pay for it?
[356:05.47]Whatever it is, I'll pay it.
[356:06.27]Who cares?
[356:07.01]It's worth it.
[356:08.89]Lyrebird.
[356:09.67]L-Y-R-E.
[356:11.81]I'm probably going to do it.
[356:14.15]But thank you, Rajasil.
[356:15.69]Thank you, Broluck, for the $10, Broluck.
[356:17.79]Hey, mate, haven't donated in a while.
[356:19.37]I was in a coma for a few months.
[356:24.93]Just kidding.
[356:26.41]You're in a coma and you have been for years.
[356:28.28]Enjoy waking up and making GTR4 videos with Star again.
[356:31.66]God damn it.
[356:34.12]Thank you, Broluck, for the $10.
[356:35.04]Thank you so much.
[356:36.92]Cheese Riot, thanks for the $1.
[356:38.10]Do you like Thanos?
[356:41.21]Do I like Thanos memes?
[356:42.31]I don't, I don't, I don't use the internet.
[356:45.93]I mean, I'm using it right now, but I don't, like, use it.
[356:49.21]I just, like, I just exist on it.
[356:52.09]How am I supposed to use the internet right here?
[356:54.01]I'm, like, stuck in here.
[356:56.25]I'm part of the internet.
[356:57.37]You want me to use the internet?
[356:59.60]How?
[357:01.80]I'm on a fucking cube this big.
[357:05.18]I'm stuck in here.
[357:06.62]I'm part of the internet.
[357:10.31]I don't use it.
[357:14.95]See, look at this fucking glass here.
[357:17.51]How do you want me to get out?
[357:19.51]How?
[357:24.28]Thank you, Timmy Tim Tim, for the $1.
[357:25.76]Good stream, Jerma.
[357:26.34]Can you please not poke me in the eye?
[357:27.60]I'm actually going to have to go to the doctor tomorrow.
[357:31.81]That's pretty good timing there.
[357:34.97]Thank you, Timmy Tim Tim.
[357:35.94]Thank you, Smelly Boy for the $1.
[357:37.32]Would you stream Fortnite if Alex Jones promised to co-op with you?
[357:45.72]No, I would not stream... No, I would not stream Fortnite.
[357:51.99]I would not stream with... I would not do that stream.
[357:58.09]Why, like...
[358:01.35]No, I think... What a fucked up question.
[358:10.92]I love my favorites though.
[358:16.62]Thank you.
[358:18.36]Thank you, Smelly Boy.
[358:20.16]Thank you, Joe Razor, for the $1.
[358:21.66]Hey, Jerma, if you played Minecraft, it would kill the memes like when you played Spore and it killed the Spore memes.
[358:26.12]Plus, it can be relaxing.
[358:27.92]No, the Spore meme was killed because when I turned on Spore, it flashed lightning fucking rays in people's eyes and they didn't want me to play it again because it was going to hurt them.
[358:37.92]That's why that happened.
[358:39.01]I'm not playing Minecraft.
[358:45.07]Uh...
[358:47.66]Thank you, Joe Razor, though.
[358:49.30]Thank you, Swoosh, for the $1.
[358:51.86]Love you, man.
[358:52.94]Your channel is like a niche comedy show.
[358:56.56]I love it.
[358:58.78]We just try to have fun here, man.
[359:01.31]Whatever happens, happens.
[359:02.25]Whatever we say, we say.
[359:03.57]I mean, sometimes we're real.
[359:06.15]Sometimes.
[359:07.79]Like I told you, 5% of the time we talk reality.
[359:11.77]The other 95% is...
[359:14.74]People asking me if I'll play Fortnite with Alex Jones.
[359:17.12]Right?
[359:17.58]Like... What was that?
[359:21.40]Look at that.
[359:21.74]That was fucking... That was a dumb... That was an ugly fucking face.
[359:24.30]At least my teeth are too big.
[359:30.73]That's the problem.
[359:34.15]But thank you.
[359:36.51]Thank you to Sir Rocky Q again for the $1 Jerma.
[359:40.01]I'm sorry about all the mean things I said earlier.
[359:41.85]You were very handsome and not bad at video games.
[359:45.44]Thanks, man.
[359:46.28]Fist pump.
[359:46.72]Ready?
[359:47.28]How you do it?
[359:47.70]You go like this?
[359:50.46]There it is.
[359:52.98]Because you go like that and you combine them together.
[359:56.76]Thank you.
[359:57.90]Appreciate that, man.
[359:58.84]Don't worry.
[359:59.24]I know we're just 95% of all things we say.
[360:01.34]Just fucking around.
[360:01.94]Don't worry.
[360:04.80]FGWGWF, thanks for the $15.
[360:09.09]Hey Jerma, I've been under the weather with pneumonia for a couple of weeks now and your streams make the hours go by sitting in bed bearable.
[360:15.62]Also been a fan since 2000 subs extravaganza and I have one question.
[360:20.42]Did you actually hit that baseball at Burger Boy's head with a bat?
[360:24.76]I mean, I did hit the, I did hit the ball, but you know, with the magic of editing, we've made it exact.
[360:37.47]I like that video.
[360:38.14]That was a fun video.
[360:40.14]That was a great time.
[360:41.28]Spraying him down with a hose afterwards was probably more fun than making the actual video.
[360:48.40]Any news about the official podcast?
[360:51.68]Oh, yeah.
[360:52.08]I was on that like four months ago.
[360:54.99]Go to the official podcast website.
[360:57.05]YouTube.com slash criticals channel, right?
[361:01.95]I'm on it.
[361:02.27]I'm already there, man.
[361:02.75]We had a good time.
[361:10.70]But thank you.
[361:13.70]Uh, but thank you though FJ, FJ, FG, FGW, GWF for the 15 fucking dollars.
[361:21.04]And then Broluck, thanks for a dollar.
[361:22.28]Bro, you talking about that shower.
[361:24.92]Uh, craygasm, craygasm, craygasm.
[361:28.70]Whatever, I didn't say it.
[361:30.30]Thank you.
[361:30.90]Thank you Asian Turtle for the one dollar.
[361:32.40]Next stream you should play, uh,
[361:35.29]Is it a Jerma quote or a porn line?
[361:37.89]For example, how about you suck a fart out of my ass?
[361:41.15]I'm going to sit in the toilet and piss into my own face.
[361:43.91]Now let's put cigarettes out on my member.
[361:46.31]That was a nice stream.
[361:47.60]Thanks, man.
[361:50.44]BarkinMad, thanks for the $1.
[361:51.94]What the heck is blinking in the background?
[361:53.32]It's giving me... That's an anti-ghost machine.
[361:57.02]The Ghostbusters gave it to me.
[361:58.10]They came to my house and they gave it to me as a gift because I was a big fan.
[362:03.92]Thank you, Vertical, for the $1.
[362:05.34]I want to watch an anime starring Jerma as the main character.
[362:08.92]And there's five hot anime women trying to get at me.
[362:15.51]Make sure that... That sounds like a great show.
[362:18.95]Thank you.
[362:19.55]I don't know if it would be very good.
[362:21.83]Thank you, Mandragora Root, for the $1.
[362:24.45]Vine Scoot, Vine Scoot, Vine Scoot.
[362:27.99]Thanks for the $1.
[362:29.65]Dr. Clay, thanks for the $1.
[362:32.09]Hey, Jerma, I was in a bit of a rut all day today.
[362:34.25]I wanted to try to make something, but I had no ideas and didn't really feel up to it.
[362:38.61]I was also sick while watching your stream.
[362:40.88]I really actually began working on one of my projects again, so thanks for pulling me out of that.
[362:45.94]You got it.
[362:47.08]Random question.
[362:47.74]What do you do if and when you find yourself out of ideas in the moment?
[362:53.26]Um... I don't know.
[362:55.46]It's just kind of whatever happens, happens.
[362:57.72]But... I'm one of those people that...
[363:00.97]When I'm lying down in bed, right?
[363:04.45]Or if I'm in the shower.
[363:05.95]Or if I'm going to the bathroom or something.
[363:09.10]I'm constantly trying to think of things to do.
[363:13.30]It just happens.
[363:13.82]I'll be lying in my bed with my iPad and I'll just be like...
[363:17.39]Okay, let's read this in the news.
[363:19.13]Oh, interesting.
[363:21.95]Oh, did you know that popcorn is actually... It is those kernels.
[363:26.09]It's the kernels of the popcorn is what popcorn actually... No, I should probably... I should probably, like, do an ASMR stream.
[363:34.02]Like, it just happens.
[363:34.72]That doesn't matter what I'm doing.
[363:38.16]Like, I could be reading about, oh, you know, did you know the dinosaurs were extinct 5,000 years ago?
[363:43.64]I should get in a bathtub with my clothes on.
[363:46.76]I don't know.
[363:47.22]It just happens.
[363:52.17]I don't really try to think of things that just kind of happen.
[363:57.07]And I think that's the more organic way to do it.
[363:59.71]Or honestly, like bouncing things and bouncing ideas off of friends and other people that, you know, somebody says something funny and then you say something that you think is funny and then they say something that's really funny connected to that and then you say something.
[364:12.08]That's usually how it works.
[364:14.11]There's been plenty of things that I've said and then somebody in chat says something else fucking really funny and then I'll react to that and then chat reacts to that.
[364:24.31]It's kind of just a process.
[364:25.61]If we get like lost and we just have, there's nothing to do.
[364:30.92]It's, I find it easier to play off of other people than to try to come up with something myself.
[364:41.62]So, you know,
[364:44.78]It's just about... It's equal parts sitting there trying to come up with things that I think are funny or interesting.
[364:50.79]And then in the moment, obviously there's a lot of people to play off of.
[364:54.59]So you play off of what's happening in the moment.
[365:00.11]Somebody just wrote pinwheel and then they laughed at me.
[365:02.92]I want them to be the president of the channel.
[365:07.62]He's using us for comedy.
[365:10.00]No, I'm, I'm just saying like, when we sit here and like, you just said that, right?
[365:15.30]So now I'm reacting to you just saying that.
[365:18.06]And now somebody else is going to say something in here.
[365:20.92]That's what I'm talking about.
[365:21.70]It's not about like bouncing back and forth.
[365:23.34]Like obviously there's like a, there's a conversation going on here that you are a part of, right?
[365:29.01]Like you just went and I didn't just come up with that.
[365:31.43]Like you said that and now I'm reacting to it.
[365:33.25]That's what I'm talking about.
[365:37.19]Anyways, I hope that answers your question somehow.
[365:41.67]Thank you to Oceans of Lotion for the $1.
[365:44.95]Do you ever check out Bill Wurtz?
[365:47.31]Is this the guy that sings about the history of the world and stuff?
[365:52.11]And he's like... Right?
[365:57.04]Okay, yeah.
[365:57.62]I've watched a lot of his videos.
[365:58.88]They were fucking hilarious.
[366:02.56]I did see his videos.
[366:04.54]Some of them.
[366:09.40]I'm actually super glad he reacts to chat.
[366:11.26]I hate when people ignore it.
[366:13.32]Yeah, but it's more fun that way.
[366:14.54]It's more fun to actually communicate with things that people say.
[366:18.19]I like reading and reacting to things that are said.
[366:23.99]It's fun.
[366:24.41]It makes me laugh sometimes.
[366:26.37]Somebody will say something and we just go off from it.
[366:33.04]That's what I mean.
[366:40.18]But thank you, Oceans of Lotion.
[366:41.22]I have checked out Bill Wurtz.
[366:43.68]Zabiva, because the one guy, the one good thing.
[366:47.72]Thank you for the bits.
[366:49.64]Smelly Jelly, thanks for the $1.
[366:50.89]You know what?
[366:51.19]I'm not even going to read this message.
[366:52.37]Mods, take care of Smelly Jelly.
[366:53.95]That's what he said.
[366:54.61]I didn't say that he did.
[366:55.87]Thank you, though.
[366:56.31]Thank you, Bark and Matt, for the $1.
[366:57.81]Since you're moving, please leak your old address.
[366:59.53]Why would I?
[366:59.83]What are you talking?
[367:00.65]Why would I do that?
[367:07.78]No, that was not right.
[367:10.42]That wasn't right either.
[367:12.75]Why the fuck would I do something like that?
[367:20.93]Anyways.
[367:21.67]Thank you.
[367:23.44]Thank you.
[367:25.08]To... BarkinMad.
[367:31.10]Thank you, Ghast.
[367:33.12]Ghast Hunter for the $1.
[367:34.62]Will you play Titanfall 2?
[367:36.41]And first donation.
[367:37.19]Thank you, Ghast Hunter.
[367:38.03]Probably not Titanfall 2.
[367:40.12]I don't really have a reason to play it.
[367:43.53]I have not listened to their album.
[367:47.69]So I can't tell you yes or no.
[367:50.60]Sorry to hear that.
[367:51.82]What?
[367:53.20]I was roleplaying as you.
[367:56.67]Uh, thank you, uh, Zabiva again for the bits there.
[368:01.06]I keep seeing, I'm reading ones that are under 100 and I'm stupid.
[368:05.64]Uh, thank you, though.
[368:06.18]Thank you, DubskiDude for the $1.
[368:07.46]Radical Republicrat streamer tries to indoctrinate, uh, youth impressionable fan base with his moderate views.
[368:17.96]Thank you, Eefs for the $1.
[368:19.27]I hope chat doesn't burn me at the stake for the video I sent earlier in the bits, but chat, I love you, and Jeremiah, I love you more.
[368:25.07]Hey, see?
[368:27.95]All the love that goes around here.
[368:29.27]Come on.
[368:32.46]Thank you, Yves.
[368:34.16]Thank you, Colonel Zero, for the $1.
[368:35.72]Thank you, EverythingGerma.
[368:37.30]I've been watching since forever.
[368:38.64]Good luck with the move.
[368:39.34]Thank you.
[368:40.98]I'm going to hope it's going to go smoothly.
[368:44.22]Sizemore, thanks for the $1.
[368:45.58]Thanks for being one of the funniest humans alive and being so kind and caring towards others.
[368:49.53]We really appreciate it.
[368:50.97]The last SecondGerma video had me crying, laughing, and I'm looking forward to what you make in the future.
[368:58.75]I'm looking forward to it too.
[369:01.05]It's a new chapter.
[369:03.45]I hope you all come along for the ride.
[369:06.85]Because there will be at least a car there.
[369:10.33]Not sure where the road's going to be, but it will be in the car.
[369:15.26]Thank you GamingHash for the $1.57.
[369:16.62]Appreciate it.
[369:18.54]I don't have much time to watch your streams anymore because of school, but I hope you move to Vegas is good.
[369:22.86]Also can't wait for green screen memes.
[369:28.52]We'll see how that turns out.
[369:30.56]That's going to be an interesting stream, which we will talk about that on Thursday.
[369:35.38]I will have a little more clarity about that situation on Thursday or Friday.
[369:39.35]We'll talk about it in depth.
[369:41.11]Thank you.
[369:43.87]Thank you, Mandra Guru, for the $1.
[369:45.71]You're the funniest person on the internet.
[369:47.21]Thanks for being you.
[369:48.25]That's an incredibly nice thing to say to somebody.
[369:51.82]I'm glad you think that way.
[369:54.98]I'll try to do better.
[369:56.02]Thank you.
[369:57.56]Uh, thank you, Ape, AppKey, for the $1.
[369:59.98]Hey, Jerma, wanted to recommend a video game I played forever ago.
[370:02.46]It's called Bug.
[370:05.32]Bug.
[370:07.21]Okay.
[370:08.59]I'll give it a, I'll give Bug a look.
[370:12.27]Uh, Vertical, thanks for the $1.
[370:13.59]If you had to have a sponsor, what would you prefer to be sponsored by?
[370:16.35]A locally owned business.
[370:19.98]Um, I don't know, that's, I don't think I would want to be sponsored by anybody.
[370:27.44]Because I hate having to answer to somebody else in a content kind of way.
[370:34.48]Because then you're responsible for showing a product or a thing or a game.
[370:42.46]I say all kinds of fucked up shit, man.
[370:44.68]I would never want to have a sponsor and be like, well, we're watching and we didn't really like what you said there.
[370:50.50]I don't care.
[370:51.39]I don't want a sponsor.
[370:53.47]It's just too much for me.
[371:00.46]It's Greg from Nvidia.
[371:05.12]Greg from Nvidia.
[371:06.40]That's old.
[371:06.80]That's a long time ago.
[371:09.76]He said no.
[371:10.38]He said no to Blue Apron?
[371:13.34]Oh, that's right.
[371:13.74]I got, like, trolled and I thought that was real.
[371:17.32]What a fucking idiot I am.
[371:19.04]I really, I thought that was actually somebody from Blue Apron.
[371:23.57]That guy had that shit up.
[371:24.99]That guy had that scheme going for, like, a week, by the way.
[371:28.63]What a gullible asshole I am.
[371:32.25]But thank you, Vertical.
[371:32.95]Thank you, Skull Kid, for the $1.
[371:35.57]If you stream Minecraft, I won't die.
[371:38.99]I'll transcend into an omnipotent being and live forever.
[371:45.36]I'm sorry.
[371:47.78]Why would that happen if I played Minecraft?
[371:51.22]No.
[371:52.44]Nobody's a god.
[371:53.40]We're just going to be regular people and not playing Minecraft.
[371:57.56]Thank you, though.
[371:58.91]Uh, Eve's, thanks for the $1.
[372:00.15]Also wanted to ask what your thoughts were on Bowsette.
[372:09.76]Um... Oh, okay, I know what you're talking about.
[372:12.18]You're talking about Princess Peach with a Spirit of Halloween bag costume on.
[372:16.70]Um... I don't understand.
[372:20.63]Okay, that's fine.
[372:24.19]I guess.
[372:25.47]It exists, apparently.
[372:29.43]But thank you.
[372:32.35]I'm not Googling it.
[372:33.29]I've already seen it.
[372:34.09]I've already seen it.
[372:35.17]It's blowing up on Twitter right now.
[372:44.81]Nobody has to introduce me to this shit.
[372:47.03]I've been introduced to it by my Twitter timeline.
[372:55.37]My Twitter feed has been this for like two days.
[373:04.76]No.
[373:06.42]But thank you, Eve.
[373:07.20]Thank you, Rub Taser, for the $1.
[373:10.81]Even with that paper-thin shirt, I can see your... You can see my house from here.
[373:17.93]Really?
[373:18.49]What the fuck?
[373:20.05]Thank you, Sleek.
[373:21.59]Thank you, Sleek Oniko, for the $3.
[373:22.98]Hey, Jerma Longtime Fan, could you just look at the camera and tell Rick that he sucks at Dark Souls?
[373:27.44]He didn't even beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[373:29.26]Rick, come on, man.
[373:31.48]But don't get discouraged.
[373:33.48]Dark Souls is a game that requires intense focus and effort.
[373:39.36]And it takes a lot of skill and working within yourself and in your body to be able to do it correctly.
[373:48.08]So don't get discouraged.
[373:48.82]You'll be fine.
[373:52.93]This guy's whack.
[373:58.90]you're doing a great job hey thank you this dude is whack thank you vertical for the one dollar is this guy still in Boston londo yep for now hey fishy thanks for the one buck hi hi uh sir rocky q thanks for the one dollar Jerma you don't need to play Minecraft to prove you go to video games you just need to beat Dark Souls 3 on stream already did that thanks for the one dollar did it already

[374:40.35]And then Tyler Mike just came in with $32.
[374:44.43]$32 from Tyler Mike.
[374:48.15]Thank you so much, Tyler Mike.
[374:51.00]Hey, Jeremy, I've recently been diagnosed with OCD, which is a disorder that causes you to obsess over any bad thing that could happen to you.
[374:59.00]or your loved ones regardless of logic to get over it you feel compulsions to do things like tap an object 20 times or think through something over and over or else the bad thing will happen my therapist tells me ignore and resist compulsions and it helps to watch your streams to try to get my mind off of it can't thank you enough turn my heart uh thank you Tyler Mike uh
[375:27.44]If I can... I've said this before to people before, but... If you can get some enjoyment or it helps to hang out here, then that's fucking great.
[375:36.22]I'm glad to hear it.
[375:38.89]I hope you continue to manage and take care of yourself and take care of... That's a hard to manage problem, obviously.
[375:49.01]I thought I had OCD for a long time.
[375:53.20]But it turns out I had ADHD.
[375:54.14]ADHD.
[375:55.91]Bad.
[375:57.76]But I wish you the best, Tyler.
[376:01.94]And if you hang out, like I said, thanks for hanging out here.
[376:06.70]Hopefully you can obviously, like I said, start to manage.
[376:10.84]Because that's all you can do.
[376:14.88]Thank you, Jeremy.
[376:15.42]Thank you.
[376:19.83]You have eight?
[376:21.23]I'm not even going to read that.
[376:23.11]Somebody's being a fucking T-R-O-L-L.
[376:29.07]But thank you for that, man.
[376:31.17]Thank you, Timmy Tim Tam, for the $1.
[376:34.10]This is my last donation.
[376:35.12]Do your ears have calluses from wearing earphones all the time because I wear them and I... Nope, because I'm one of those... I don't wear earphones.
[376:42.28]I don't wear earphones.
[376:43.32]I probably look a little fucked up tonight.
[376:44.66]Don't look at that fucking airline.
[376:47.92]I wear earbuds only.
[376:50.70]Only.
[376:51.94]Only the last two days I've had a headset on.
[376:54.96]So I don't really have that problem.
[376:57.63]Spooky Shpee, thanks for the $1.
[376:58.61]Hey, Jeremy, I've been watching since 7th grade and now I'm a freshman in college.
[377:01.69]Crazy how time flies.
[377:03.53]Hope your move goes well.
[377:04.61]Keep being you.
[377:05.41]P.S.
[377:05.75]Please give One Shot a look.
[377:07.18]It's a really cool game.
[377:10.46]One Shot.
[377:13.88]Cool.
[377:17.70]Is it good?
[377:19.82]Can anybody attest to that?
[377:22.35]Pretty good game.
[377:22.89]Okay.
[377:23.23]Pretty good game.
[377:26.36]Where are we now?
[377:27.06]Here.
[377:29.10]Thank you, Jörg, for the $1.
[377:31.64]No message.
[377:32.14]Thank you for the $1, Jörg.
[377:34.40]Thank you, HeteroKorgi, for the $1.
[377:36.02]If you could beat Pinwheel without dying, do it again on stream right now.
[377:40.74]No, I can't.
[377:41.50]I can't even play a game on the computer right now.
[377:45.54]That's something I'll go download the VOD and go play that VOD.
[377:50.75]Thank you eCookie for the $1.
[377:52.39]Where's your Choose Your Own Adventure book?
[377:53.87]I will boil your teeth.
[377:54.93]I deleted it because it wasn't good enough, and I didn't like it, and it was taking way too much time and too much work, and I was an idiot, and I told everybody that it was going to keep happening, and it was just me pushing the fucking road further down.
[378:07.01]It was way too much fucking work, and I couldn't handle it.
[378:10.78]Is that a good enough full answer?
[378:13.76]Oof.
[378:14.78]It's okay, man.
[378:18.10]I didn't know.
[378:18.52]Actually, he still exists.
[378:21.86]I have some of it.
[378:22.72]Yeah, I posted almost every single panel I had.
[378:26.85]But it is what it is.
[378:28.75]Thank you, eCookie.
[378:29.49]Thank you, Vertical, for the $1.
[378:30.63]If you ever end up becoming a streamer that only played one game, that will never happen.
[378:36.17]I would prefer you end up playing the new Super Smash Bros.
[378:38.36]in order to become the best Pac-Man in the world.
[378:41.98]That's not going to happen.
[378:43.90]I can barely do the same thing for two hours, let alone six months.
[378:48.26]That's not going to happen.
[378:49.78]So you never have to worry about that.
[378:52.67]Thank you, Darth Nix, for the $10.
[378:57.32]Why are you moving to Vegas?
[378:59.38]Are you going to miss Star?
[379:00.32]I've been watching you for a long time.
[379:01.60]Well, Star does not live here anymore.
[379:05.02]I'm moving to Vegas for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, probably 15 different reasons.
[379:10.18]And Star does not live here anymore.
[379:13.19]He is gone.
[379:14.35]He moved somewhere else.
[379:16.25]And I am moving to Vegas because internet.
[379:19.35]Cost of living.
[379:22.23]Proximity to Los Angeles.
[379:24.77]24 hour city.
[379:26.25]There's a lot of things.
[379:27.87]A lot of reasons.
[379:30.22]So it's going to be an interesting next 12 months.
[379:33.62]I hope.
[379:36.78]15 reasons.
[379:37.16]I got to read the other 15 reasons.
[379:39.46]God.
[379:40.72]My brain.
[379:42.63]The blistering heat.
[379:45.53]I like it hot, though.
[379:46.77]It's fine.
[379:49.15]Being hot is not as bad as being fucking rainy and cold like it is every day here sometimes.
[379:54.82]It rains like a hundred days a year in Massachusetts.
[379:58.20]I'd like a little dry weather for a change.
[380:01.78]But, thank you.
[380:04.05]Thank you, Proluck, for the $2, for all the love I feel for you.
[380:06.65]I'm still glad you're not my dad.
[380:15.49]Maybe it's because you're insane.
[380:17.53]Or it might just be because you're famous, or you might have nightmares of you snorting.
[380:21.03]Alright, thank you.
[380:23.31]Thank you, Broluck, for the $2 here.
[380:28.26]JLPack, thanks for the $2.
[380:31.22]What's the plan for this stream?
[380:33.26]Happy birthday.
[380:36.18]We streamed for about six and a half hours here.
[380:38.43]Played L.A.
[380:38.93]No More.
[380:39.19]I'm going to play it again on Thursday.
[380:41.97]That was the plan, and that's what we executed.
[380:44.64]But thank you for the two bucks, man.
[380:46.26]Thank you, KXZ, for the $15.
[380:48.06]On a more serious note, I saw during yesterday's stream you happened to have Yakuza 0.
[380:52.68]Any chance of streaming it at some point?
[380:54.81]I already did.
[380:56.41]And I kind of... Something else came up and I ended up just not doing it anymore.
[381:01.93]I was sort of... I don't know what happened.
[381:05.93]I think it was like... It was a slow start.
[381:09.49]I wasn't really feeling it.
[381:11.24]But I was told you have to keep playing it.
[381:13.34]And it gets much better.
[381:14.08]Because it's a really fun game.
[381:17.14]I didn't hate it.
[381:17.68]What are you talking about?
[381:18.44]I thought it was fun.
[381:20.12]There was a bunch of mini games.
[381:21.80]That was a long time ago now.
[381:24.20]But.
[381:25.86]Yeah.
[381:27.38]Probably not anytime soon.
[381:29.04]For Yakuza 0.
[381:30.76]But thank you KXE.
[381:31.84]For the 15 fucking dollars.
[381:35.20]Thank you Timmy Tim Tam for the $1.00.
[381:36.22]Oh look I meant earbuds not earphones.
[381:38.72]Do your ears have calluses or not?
[381:40.20]Answer my question.
[381:42.68]I... I... No.
[381:43.68]I... Didn't I say no?
[381:45.68]I thought I said no.
[381:46.86]That I don't like have that problem.
[381:49.14]I don't have calluses in my ears or anything.
[381:54.02]I thought I answered it.
[381:54.84]I'm sorry I didn't.
[381:57.49]Anyways.
[381:59.17]Thank you eCookie for the $1.00.
[382:01.07]I'm sorry and I forgive you.
[382:02.11]Hey thanks.
[382:03.80]eefs thanks for the one dollar two words watch jojo 2019 it's by one anime a year uh I'll get to watch it I can't wait vertical thanks for the one dollar despite all the crazy stuff I say in chat and all the bits you are incredible hey thanks and one of the only things I care about these days if we ever met in real life please let me buy you a milkshake or something will do thank you vertical um
[382:31.82]I hope you start to feel better about stuff in general.
[382:37.67]And like I said before, say it again, any enjoyment you get from this stream, I'm glad you do.
[382:45.58]Thank you.
[382:48.06]Also, Weeble, $5 from Weeble.
[382:50.98]Hey, Jerm, I've been watching you since 2013.
[382:53.04]You've helped me out in tough times, and I always want to thank you for the laughs over the years.
[382:56.70]Please never change, and I hope Vegas treats you well.
[383:00.27]I hope Vegas treats me well, too.
[383:01.79]Because it's been a long time coming.
[383:06.63]Long time coming.
[383:08.45]We'll see if it was worth it.
[383:10.36]Thank you for the $5, dude.
[383:13.22]And then only a couple more.
[383:14.66]Chubby Funster for $1.
[383:15.86]Thank you, Chubby.
[383:17.40]Would you ever do a corruption stream like Vinny does or play a bunch of bootleg games?
[383:21.04]I think it would be pretty funny to see you do it.
[383:25.71]Unless I really felt like doing it or something called for the reason.
[383:28.71]You know, I...
[383:30.77]Probably not.
[383:33.93]Unless there was a reason why I wanted to do that.
[383:37.69]Then probably not.
[383:40.65]I've already done similar things like that over the last couple of years.
[383:44.89]So it's not like I haven't done anything like that before.
[383:48.54]But specific bootleg games, maybe not.
[383:53.20]But thank you.
[383:54.90]SynthesisPandaBot, thanks for the $1.
[383:57.81]I was recently diagnosed with a furry.
[383:59.97]So watching your streams over the past few days has really helped me come to terms with my condition.
[384:03.47]I won't stop playing video games.
[384:04.73]They're bad.
[384:07.73]Thank you, TimmyTimTam for the $1.
[384:09.47]Can you listen to Death Grips live on stream?
[384:14.53]Tell me to stop donating.
[384:15.89]Hey, stop donating then.
[384:18.45]What?
[384:20.27]No, I can't.
[384:21.71]VOD is going to get fucked.
[384:23.23]No, I can't.
[384:25.60]CyanTF2, thanks for $1.
[384:27.16]Good luck in Vegas.
[384:27.84]It's exciting to see my favorite streamer have good things happen in his life.
[384:30.94]Thank you.
[384:33.60]Hopefully it keeps getting better.
[384:36.14]I'm going to try.
[384:36.60]We'll see what happens.
[384:40.14]You played Green Day yesterday, but that's public domain by now.
[384:43.46]Green Day is as old as Mickey Mouse.
[384:46.02]Thank you, Vertical, for the $1.
[384:48.68]Also, I was thinking of making a novelty Twitch account that reports on the local streamer and makes clips out of context with sensationalized headlines.
[384:55.83]I plan on calling it The Germalist.
[385:00.13]Motherfucker.
[385:02.49]Kyrenski, thanks for the $1.
[385:03.85]Hey, Jerma, what's your favorite place to go on vacation?
[385:06.25]Where would you want to go?
[385:06.99]Japan.
[385:08.15]I would love to visit Japan.
[385:10.17]Just because it... I've never left the continental North America.
[385:14.91]I feel like Japan would be an interesting place to go.
[385:18.09]Or Europe.
[385:19.35]Someplace in Europe.
[385:20.86]I've had friends of mine that have visited Prague and they said it was great.
[385:24.84]I'd love to do something like that.
[385:29.36]Trying desperately to outpace the donators.
[385:34.06]That's not...
[385:41.49]Europe sucks?
[385:42.15]What?
[385:43.63]What's wrong with Europe?
[385:46.61]What's wrong?
[385:46.93]I don't understand.
[385:50.79]What's wrong?
[385:52.59]But thank you, Vertical.
[385:53.33]Thank you, Kyrinsky.
[385:54.67]And Broluck at the very end.
[385:55.87]Thanks for $5, Broluck.
[385:57.23]Who cares about vacations?
[386:00.09]Vacation can be nice if you've never been somewhere before, right?
[386:03.15]Taking the culture, taking the other places.
[386:05.31]It's not a bad thing.
[386:06.93]Come on.
[386:07.23]It's a vacation.
[386:12.29]And then finally, Devakitty with $1.
[386:17.53]Thank you, Devakitty, for the $1.
[386:18.43]Hey, Jerma, my router died when you were playing L.A.
[386:21.57]Noire and I lost most of the stream.
[386:22.97]Also, my router is smelling very pungently of ozone.
[386:25.53]Am I going to die?
[386:26.23]I would unplug it.
[386:30.27]I would unplug it and call the nearest repairman tomorrow and make sure that everything's alright.
[386:39.03]Thank you, though.
[386:39.99]Be careful with that shit.
[386:42.61]And I should play Thief on stream.
[386:46.53]Maybe.
[386:47.69]Maybe.
[386:49.57]And then Broluck at the very end, thanks for $1.
[386:51.34]Have a dollar.
[386:51.98]Waste time.
[386:52.70]I'm wasting your time and it's worth my dollar.
[386:57.86]Thank you, everybody.
[386:59.24]I'll see you on Thursday.
[387:01.02]Have a great rest of your day, your night.
[387:03.92]Still fairly early.
[387:04.78]Have a good sleep, everybody that's about to go to sleep.
[387:08.54]I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[387:09.96]More L.A.
[387:10.46]Noire.
[387:14.52]Good stuff.
[387:15.12]No outro.
[387:15.80]It's going to be awkward.
[387:16.52]It's awkward every time I don't have a fucking outro.
[387:18.30]Because I just go like... And then I turn off the stream.
[387:25.07]So, good night.
[387:26.67]Take care.
[387:27.61]CluelessSniper, thanks for the $1.
[387:28.97]Good night.
[387:30.19]And TimmyTimTam, thanks for the $1.
[387:31.77]Did you know that if you make an aerosol can, we're going to reverse and it repairs the ozone layer.
[387:37.53]Don't do that.
[387:38.62]Have a wonderful day.
[387:40.90]Do not turn that upside down.
[387:43.10]Don't do that.
[387:45.34]Good night.
[387:51.11]Proluck, no.
[387:52.09]One dollar.
[387:52.61]My sister is a person here.
[387:54.37]Thanks for one dollar.
[387:55.06]How are my parents?
[387:55.68]Parents are doing great.
