[ve:60.16.100]

[00:06.09]until you tested it.
[00:07.69]Oh, you're the first thing they heard was you loudly yelling.
[00:13.47]Yeah, hi guys.
[00:14.27]We're not currently live yet.
[00:16.20]I mean, well, Ster is.
[00:18.72]The moment you start watching me play POE on your stream, you're going to drop down to 1k viewers concurrent for the rest of your life.
[00:28.76]They just funnel everybody to you and they never come back.
[00:34.40]No, they're just gone forever from, like, both of us.
[00:37.39]Oh, they just disappear.
[00:39.07]Yeah, they, like, see what's on the screen and go, why was I watching this guy?
[00:44.37]So maybe, like, later I can show you.
[00:45.43]Just immediately unfollow both channels.
[00:47.35]Yeah, and we can just go to Dying Light.
[00:50.44]Alright, fine.
[00:51.24]Alright.
[00:51.78]Well, you show me later.
[00:52.82]Okay.
[00:54.44]Yeah, we're going to play Dying Light 2, or what would have been a more funnier title, Coffee Cheetos Chicken Remastered.
[01:05.04]I didn't want to put that in the title, though, because I don't want to... It's Zombie Jackasses 2?
[01:08.85]Yeah.
[01:09.51]You know what's really funny about Coffee Cheetos Chicken?
[01:14.21]That video's not even live?
[01:15.71]That's an unlisted fucking video, yeah.
[01:17.76]That is an un... On your channel, it was a secret, hidden video that you had.
[01:21.46]I don't know how everybody found it and it became what it is.
[01:25.42]It was a secret video.
[01:32.10]did you eventually public it no I did I made a joke that I would and I never did oh that's funny I mean it's unlisted never made public it's about 200 000 views which is like which is I mean which is that's crazy for it being unlisted but in the grand scheme of things of how many people reference that exact video that's not very much yeah I would have thought it would have been more with how much it gets brought up
[02:02.53]Alright, let's... Yeah, I'm getting in the game.
[02:04.86]Do I just invite you?
[02:07.10]Well, I'm not online yet.

[03:54.49]I don't know.
[03:55.94]No, your game is public.
[03:57.66]This game is public.

[04:21.91]We're ready to go We just wanted to figure out how to make multiplayer work It's not even two o'clock we're fine Okay, accept an invite
[04:35.99]Hey, I have a question.
[04:36.77]I actually have, like, I'm deeply curious.
[04:39.11]Hold on.
[04:39.63]Because... I gotta show the actual stream, though.
[04:42.54]Oh, sorry.
[04:42.86]Don't roll.
[04:44.22]Yeah.
[04:44.68]Alright.
[04:45.10]Anyways, can you, like, talk a little bit to make sure I get the audio levels correct?
[04:50.82]Okay.
[04:51.22]Okay.
[04:53.56]I think it's good.
[04:55.02]Okay.
[04:56.60]Alright.
[04:57.54]So what was your question?
[04:59.23]um so whenever like it's like oh hey like Ster and Jerma are gonna do a stream they come into my offline chat and they'll type exclamation point sus so I'm curious like I you know me and you we're gonna know we know where that joke comes from but do people think now that that's like an among us reference yeah oh yeah they do okay that's sad that's very disappointing right that that that is an among us reference well to the old uh viewers no
[05:27.04]They know nothing of Anilander.
[05:29.20]Yeah, I mean, that's a great game.
[05:30.98]Have you ever played that game, like, on stream?
[05:34.43]Uh, no.
[05:35.33]I think I played through the first two.
[05:36.93]You really should.
[05:37.53]I mean, you're gonna hate it, but you're gonna, like, probably love it at the same time.
[05:41.37]You're gonna love certain aspects of that game, but you're gonna, like... Well, I just told you I played the first two, and you're telling me, like, I've never... Oh, you're gonna love it.
[05:47.65]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[05:48.67]There's a difference.
[05:49.15]The first two are good.
[05:50.27]The second, the third, and the fourth are very all over the place.
[05:53.61]I didn't even know there was a fourth one.
[05:55.87]The fourth one is I would consider the worst of the four.
[05:59.45]You're gonna hate it.
[06:00.25]Yeah, the worst.
[06:00.70]You're gonna hate it.
[06:01.50]You're gonna come to me and be like, why did you tell me to play that?
[06:03.76]Here's all the things wrong with it.
[06:04.76]You're gonna give me like a list of shit that's wrong with that game.
[06:09.05]Okay.
[06:09.73]You ready for Dying Light 2?
[06:11.15]I'm in the game.
[06:12.79]Alright, so the story so far.
[06:15.81]We just jumped in.
[06:17.45]We had to get the thing, the marker for our arm.
[06:20.93]And does anybody really care?
[06:23.25]Or do you just want us to go walk around and hit each other with grenades and stuff?
[06:26.03]I skipped every single possible cutscene.
[06:29.68]Okay, I kind of know what's going on.
[06:32.80]Yeah, so you meet this guy, and you're running with him, and he's like, yeah, back before the plague hit, and you do all that stuff.
[06:37.28]Wrong game.
[06:38.24]Let's go.
[06:39.28]You're like, you are the vaccine man, because someone has to be vaccine guy or, like, experimental zombie, and that's us, and now we're going to do, like, parkour on zombies.
[06:50.68]Alright, so we need to meet the people of the bazaar.
[06:54.85]Who do we talk to first?
[06:58.27]Anybody?
[06:58.59]Just talk to anybody?
[06:59.79]I got stuck on this quest.
[07:01.77]You got stuck on this?
[07:03.29]Yeah.
[07:03.61]Did you not do this?
[07:04.79]No.
[07:05.36]Once I was able to do multiplayer, I just left.
[07:08.86]Okay.
[07:09.10]Well, I came to a safe zone because I thought we'd have to be in a safe zone for me to invite you.
[07:13.08]And then it asked me to meet the people.
[07:14.84]And I walked around and tried to talk to everyone for like 15 minutes.
[07:17.48]Okay.
[07:20.06]Should I buy this?
[07:20.60]I don't have any money.
[07:23.02]Sell all valuables for $700?
[07:25.70]Should I do that?
[07:27.44]Yeah.
[07:27.60]Alright.
[07:29.08]Well, we know how to trade.
[07:30.00]Okay.
[07:31.10]I know.
[07:31.28]Do you have to do the two quests?
[07:35.54]Alright, so who do I talk to?
[07:36.72]That's so loud for me.
[07:38.28]I'm sorry, guys.
[07:38.96]I know everybody hates how quiet my game audio is, but I have to drop it because it's too loud for me.
[07:51.43]Alright, so where we going?
[07:53.35]I think we're gonna do like a side quest or something.
[07:56.59]Meet the people of the bazaar.
[07:58.49]There's nobody here we have to talk to individually.
[08:00.41]I talked to them.
[08:01.73]I got a few side quests.
[08:02.89]We can just like, let's just leave.
[08:05.47]And like, you know, find our own way in this vast open world.
[08:07.89]I don't think we... Dude, we can't leave until we talk to the right people.
[08:11.88]What?
[08:13.48]The only way out, meet people in the bazaar.
[08:15.74]What?
[08:16.50]We can just leave.
[08:18.64]The only way out is talk to us.
[08:20.52]Oh, that's the quest name.
[08:21.84]Alright.
[08:22.14]Let's go.
[08:22.48]Funny stuff.
[08:23.32]I can't swing at you.
[08:24.42]I can't hit you.
[08:25.34]Yeah, because we're in like a safe zone.
[08:26.79]Can't use weapons here.
[08:27.63]Oh, alright.
[08:29.37]This is the front door.
[08:30.17]We got something.
[08:33.97]What?
[08:34.83]This is a main story.
[08:36.10]I didn't.
[08:46.87]Oh yeah, that's the whole plot.
[08:48.51]All you need to know is we're looking for a girlfriend.
[08:54.13]Okay.
[08:59.38]Okay, so we met that person.
[09:03.10]Now let's go meet somebody else over here.
[09:05.10]I'll tell you something.
[09:08.04]You correct me if I'm wrong here, Starr.
[09:10.62]Is this game... This game is very well optimized for me.
[09:14.61]It runs at a lightning fast 100 frames a second, no matter what.
[09:18.07]Lightning fast?
[09:19.59]I played Watch Dogs Legion, and it was one of the worst experiences of my entire life.
[09:24.87]If I alt-tab, I can't click any of my other windows, is my experience.
[09:30.34]Like, OBS, I can't minimize or adjust in any way.
[09:34.14]Yeah, but the game looks great, though, doesn't it?
[09:37.14]Who paid you?
[09:37.92]We gotta go down.
[09:39.02]Nobody.
[09:39.30]Oh, we have to go in here.
[09:41.60]Alright, so... It does.
[09:43.64]It does.
[09:45.32]Oh, that's great.
[09:46.08]Like, I remember that first part when you're looking at the... Like, all the trees and shit.
[09:50.07]It was... I was very worried this game would be trash after all the delays and all the bad press it got.
[09:57.05]Yeah.
[09:58.03]I'm... I'm not gonna say shit.
[09:59.81]We usually talk shit about games.
[10:01.31]That's what we do.
[10:01.83]That's like our thing.
[10:04.50]I'm about to be- okay, but I'm about to get mad.
[10:09.46]How the fuck do we just progress this?
[10:15.59]You have to do something?
[10:16.51]Am I just like a guy that's here like as your sidekick?
[10:18.95]Like where- I don't have like a quest marker, do you?
[10:20.91]Who else do we have to meet in the bazaar?
[10:34.55]Peacekeepers closed off the passage to the city center.
[10:36.72]To get there, Khan and I had to find a way around the patrols.
[10:39.82]Meet the people of the... Oh, they're in front of us.
[10:43.62]Alright.
[10:44.26]Hi.
[10:44.36]How do we leave?
[10:44.94]Yeah, okay.
[10:45.68]Okay.
[10:46.00]Cheers.
[10:46.36]Let's go.
[10:47.74]New quest.
[10:48.90]What?
[10:50.26]Cheers.
[10:50.64]Find Marco, the water supplier.
[10:53.26]Oh, nice.
[10:53.82]Everyone just don't want to calm down.
[10:56.10]Alright.
[10:56.32]I'm calming down.
[10:57.28]We're looking for water chips.
[10:58.74]Alright.
[10:58.96]Are we ready?
[10:59.28]No.
[11:05.87]So.
[11:06.61]Oh, now I got my bat.
[11:07.51]Cool.
[11:07.93]Don't even.
[11:09.11]Oh, Tony.
[11:09.59]Come on, man.
[11:10.19]Tony, you're going to swing and you're going to hit me?
[11:11.79]Friendly fire?
[11:13.31]It's not.
[11:13.57]It doesn't exist.
[11:14.13]Okay.
[11:14.95]Alright.
[11:18.36]Where are we going?
[11:22.88]You can't hit anybody.
[11:24.06]Yeah, I broke my weapon on him.
[11:26.50]Wait, what?
[11:30.87]Is this?
[11:31.73]Wait, he's on zombies.
[11:33.45]That was just a guy.
[11:34.45]You got to clear him out.
[11:36.73]That was just a person.
[11:38.59]Going through the trash?
[11:40.37]Who does that?
[11:42.33]You're all just going through the trash?
[11:45.64]I don't think we're supposed to be doing this.
[11:48.32]I'm from Austin.
[11:49.34]That's what we do here.
[11:51.88]What?
[11:53.90]We got to go get the water chips.
[11:58.34]Where is it?
[12:01.44]Do you not have the objective markers?
[12:02.98]Oh, I do.
[12:03.34]Yeah, I do.
[12:04.52]Why are you hurting innocent people?
[12:06.56]What happened?
[12:07.02]Wait, are these... Can we talk to these people?
[12:10.35]Oh, trying to talk after the apocalypse.
[12:15.71]Wait, what's going on?
[12:18.85]These are zombies here.
[12:21.75]No, not that guy.
[12:23.55]Where's the guy?
[12:26.28]We are not supposed to be... Alright, don't stop hitting innocent people.
[12:31.05]That guy ran away and said, who did that after you slammed him in the head.
[12:37.95]What's going on?
[12:40.93]Alright, let's focus here.
[12:42.19]We need to focus.
[12:44.05]Turn off the health bars, please.
[12:47.37]I love how they added Metal Gear Solid neck breaks to the zombies.
[12:56.22]Watch out, watch out, guy coming right in.
[13:03.34]Honestly, they're like so... Like you feel bad for them.
[13:10.10]You... Hold on.
[13:11.00]You feel bad for the zombies that you're killing but not for like the regular innocent people that you hit that were in the trash can.
[13:16.35]They can defend themselves.
[13:17.79]These zombies cannot.
[13:23.40]Alright, so we have to get... Okay, let's go.
[13:25.87]Okay, let's focus.
[13:26.93]Focus.
[13:27.67]Marker number one.
[13:29.13]Follow me, runner.
[13:29.71]Alright, fine.
[13:30.15]Let's go.
[13:31.49]If you guys don't know, Dying Light 2 has some parkouring in it.
[13:34.47]It's all about staying on the rooftop, staying away from danger.
[13:38.09]Trying to find your way above roof to roof.
[13:41.27]You don't want to alert the horde.
[13:43.13]That's a big problem in this game.
[13:44.53]You got to be very careful.
[13:48.55]It's actually a pretty fluid experience so far, jumping from place to place.
[13:53.72]But we're going to give it the real review here.
[13:56.20]I'm not going to be like those other reviewers.
[13:57.56]We're not going to be like those other people that you watch where they don't go into real, real super detail.
[14:03.30]Yeah, we're going to do some detailed talking about this game and what it means.
[14:09.86]Why is this weapon broken?
[14:13.10]My game is not suddenly when we're fighting things.
[14:19.22]How do I put a new weapon on?
[14:22.23]Wait, you can jump on- Oh wait, wait, I remember this from the tutorial.
[14:24.12]Ready?
[14:24.28]That didn't do anything.
[14:30.22]Ready?
[14:32.61]I can do- You can do a- You can do a dropkick.
[14:34.03]Watch this.
[14:35.17]Watch it.
[14:36.19]What?
[14:40.55]Is that you?
[14:42.03]I thought that was you.
[14:47.43]What's going on?
[14:51.10]Why are we killing normal people, Jerma?
[14:53.26]I don't know.
[14:53.80]Yeah, you're right.
[15:01.48]In combat, my frames are dropping a little bit.
[15:03.74]Not very much, though.
[15:04.48]Alright, heal up.
[15:07.52]Heal up.
[15:08.10]Everyone, bandage up.
[15:09.20]I don't...
[15:11.32]Can you guys play games normally, please?
[15:13.89]What is not normal?
[15:14.71]What did we do abnormal so far?
[15:16.93]We just killed a few people.
[15:18.13]Wait, lockpicks.
[15:23.13]Are you good at these?
[15:23.67]I'm usually not that great at this.
[15:27.12]How can you be bad at it?
[15:28.30]You did it.
[15:28.78]You're good.
[15:29.72]You gotta have confidence.
[15:30.58]I thought this said coffee sneakers and I was about to do it.
[15:36.84]Do you get something in there too?
[15:40.29]Yeah, coffee sneakers.
[15:42.93]You actually get this?
[15:44.17]Do we share loot?
[15:45.19]Okay.
[15:45.51]Yeah.
[15:46.11]Okay.
[15:46.35]Alright, cool.
[15:46.93]So... Alright, cool.
[15:47.94]Yeah.
[15:48.28]Can you make the X?
[15:48.88]That does not look like it would be safe at all.
[15:57.42]It's one single spring mattress.
[16:00.32]If you put a Tempur-Pedic down here, it would... You'd still break all your bones.
[16:04.04]This is bullshit.
[16:05.19]You can't even break dance.
[16:09.57]I mean, I can, but not anymore.
[16:11.57]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[16:17.17]He started choking you.
[16:24.32]He's like, get out of here.
[16:25.62]I'll do that to you.
[16:30.06]Okay, dude, can you land on the bed of that truck?
[16:32.80]Okay, I guess maybe.
[16:38.04]Land on the bed of the truck.
[16:40.62]Oh my god, that guy's coming up there.
[16:42.08]That guy's better than you.
[16:45.73]They have bow and arrows?
[16:47.72]They're throwing daggers or something.
[16:49.50]They're ignoring the zombies.
[16:53.34]What the fuck was that?
[16:54.12]I got you.
[16:56.28]It kind of worked.
[17:00.62]I just got the guy's head off.
[17:06.14]Make sure you're looking for... Hit your gamer sense.
[17:09.64]Because you need to craft stuff in this game.
[17:12.79]It's a bit of a looter crafter.
[17:13.97]It's kind of like Breath of the Wild.
[17:15.05]Wait, he's fighting the zombie.
[17:18.95]Oh, don't watch your stamina bar.
[17:28.74]Why is the game so juicy?
[17:38.04]It is really juicy, isn't it?
[17:39.50]It's very like chunky.
[17:40.80]A little bit creamy, a little bit.
[17:43.99]Okay, so we keep going.
[17:44.89]This is 200 and how far away is this?
[17:52.05]Don't aggro the horde!
[17:53.42]I'm not.
[17:58.26]It's really creamy.
[18:00.94]Really cream-cheesy.
[18:03.86]How come everything takes like 40 hits?
[18:05.98]Because we're level... We're level 1 and they're like level 2.
[18:08.97]Yeah, but these are level 2 zombies.
[18:10.53]These zombies haven't done any quests.
[18:14.75]This game is too loud.
[18:16.27]I'm turning it down again.
[18:16.97]Power attacks?
[18:23.30]Oh, that's right.
[18:23.72]You have to dodge.
[18:24.14]If you hold the direction and hit space, you'll do a Dark Souls dodge.
[18:31.60]Yeah, is that- is that a power attack?
[18:34.13]Are we not on a power attack here?
[18:37.63]Just mute the game?
[18:39.61]Yeah, I think you should.
[18:41.41]We actually probably need to be looking for stuff because, look, I mean, like, you open trash cans and take scrap and stuff.
[18:46.29]Why are we- why are we rushing through?
[18:47.67]We've been waiting for this game for, like, seven years.
[18:50.39]Have we?
[18:51.45]You and I, we've talked about, like, man, that fucking dying light.
[18:55.59]Tunnel troll and coffee and Cheetos and stuff.
[18:57.91]We've been waiting for this shit.
[19:00.60]Alright, well, let's, you know, take some time, roleplay, and, you know, make sure, you know, we really engross ourselves into the environment.
[19:07.12]Remember the guy... Oh, I gotta get home!
[19:08.62]I gotta get home!
[19:09.20]My mom's gonna kill me!
[19:10.05]Remember the guy outside that was running away?
[19:11.75]He was, like, the big zombie guy, and he ran into the fence.
[19:13.61]Remember?
[19:14.05]I'm gonna heal you.
[19:18.39]I don't even remember... Don't... Alright.
[19:20.23]Actually, we need to craft those.
[19:24.09]I don't remember.
[19:25.66]You actually don't remember?
[19:26.44]That was, like, one of the funniest things, like, in any of the videos we ever made.
[19:31.94]It was like this special super infected guy, and it was light out.
[19:35.21]Oh, that fell into the fence?
[19:36.49]Yeah, he ran into the fence and died.
[19:42.69]Just say it already.
[19:43.79]No!
[19:44.47]I'm not just gonna say it because we're in the game's sequel.
[19:46.85]We have to actually find the thing for me to say it.
[19:56.63]everybody's waiting we gotta go save that guy over there that guy's looking like he's in a little bit of danger which one oh yep why do I feel like all these bandits are just getting along oh I'm gonna die yeah we got a crafter
[20:22.30]This game looks like New Vegas.
[20:24.56]Am I crouching?
[20:36.20]What are we even doing?
[20:37.50]I don't know.
[20:39.02]We're trying to get to this water tower and we've killed like 30 people along the way.
[20:45.17]Everybody's just swinging melee weapons at each other outside.
[20:49.43]Is this chivalry?
[20:50.49]Yeah, it just feels like Mordhau.
[20:54.13]It is chivalry.
[21:01.99]All we need is to press like the emote button and go And then get vote kicked out of the server
[21:15.80]Where are you?
[21:16.94]I'm right here hitting the guy in the more town.
[21:18.94]Oh, shit!
[21:22.93]Okay.
[21:23.77]So let's go... Hey, let's go up.
[21:25.63]We gotta stay on the rooftops in this kind of game.
[21:27.11]You know, it's a little bit of parkour.
[21:29.01]Oh, you're right.
[21:29.51]Hold on.
[21:30.13]You're right.
[21:30.45]We do have to stay on the rooftops.
[21:31.57]This shit's too loud.
[21:34.49]I know people are gonna be mad at me for this, but whatever.
[21:36.43]It's too loud for me.
[21:40.93]Watch out.
[21:43.15]We got some homeless up here.
[21:46.68]Is there actually somebody up there?
[21:57.74]Why?
[21:58.38]Wait, I thought there were zombies.
[21:59.53]I thought there was... I didn't... Wait, what?
[22:00.91]I thought they were actually zombies.
[22:04.95]I thought they were like monsters.
[22:06.83]Alright, we got to get out of here.
[22:08.49]We got to leave.
[22:10.09]We have to leave.
[22:12.18]Okay.
[22:12.66]Okay.
[22:14.76]We have to get out of here.
[22:15.83]That guy just walked off.
[22:16.71]I didn't do that.
[22:17.27]Shit.
[22:18.17]Go.
[22:19.53]Is he going to follow?
[22:26.87]Everyone wants to be.
[22:27.94]Okay.
[22:29.36]We get my enemy.
[22:34.62]When do we get guns?
[22:37.44]I don't know when we do one side questing.
[22:39.66]This is fun.
[22:40.24]Oh, what is this?
[22:41.54]We gotta defeat that.
[22:42.30]That guy's getting fucked up.
[22:43.76]Get him!
[22:44.58]Oh, go, go!
[22:45.87]Where is he?
[22:47.11]Oh, shit!
[22:47.73]I just broke my leg.
[22:49.81]He's running!
[22:51.27]Why is he running?
[22:55.67]I don't understand.
[22:56.31]You just beat that guy up.
[22:58.23]He's a thief.
[22:59.77]Murder him!
[23:03.33]Murder him!
[23:06.13]You cut his head off.
[23:08.10]Bandit caught.
[23:09.06]Bandit decapitated.
[23:10.72]What?
[23:12.64]What did he have on him?
[23:14.12]Oh my god.
[23:17.80]He had some... You have collected a new collectible.
[23:29.18]Every weapon I have is broken.
[23:31.75]we not okay are we not supposed to be I have like a cane I don't think we're supposed to be just whacking people with these I think we need them in them for what I don't I mean do you have any other weapons I don't I've got I think I got two I mean we're still doing it I have like tiny tim's cane you're like beating up a random zombie there's a guy in a ski mask for me
[24:05.21]We need to... I'm leaving.
[24:06.59]I'm running away.
[24:07.69]We're going to the quest marker because we're going to break all of our weapons.
[24:10.61]Okay, okay, okay.
[24:11.51]We got to go on the rooftops, Jarmo.
[24:12.97]This is a little bit of a parkour game.
[24:14.50]Oh, that's right.
[24:14.86]That's right.
[24:15.12]That's right.
[24:15.52]It's a parkour kind of experience.
[24:18.08]Follow me.
[24:20.24]I know the route.
[24:23.00]Come on, powder.
[24:29.40]Was that... Did you just make an arcane reference?
[24:34.08]It's what's hip.
[24:34.70]You gotta stay relevant.
[24:38.40]I only know that because I saw the first two episodes.
[24:42.62]And you didn't watch the rest?
[24:45.69]I mean, I probably will eventually.
[24:47.63]I always watch one episode of TV and then never watch it again.
[24:50.05]What's going on?
[24:59.09]This game is so crunchy.
[25:00.57]What?
[25:04.08]okay league of legends Andy I'm not the one that made the reference he did I don't know you're talking about it a lot alright but look before we go any further yeah I need to make it really clear you're you're running where I'm right here
[25:29.54]When a game has really beautiful trees, that's usually an indicator that it's going to run at like 15 frames a second.
[25:37.14]Is that wrong or not?
[25:40.28]I guess that's a fair assessment.
[25:45.12]Every time I've ever played a game where it was like, look at how detailed our environment is.
[25:49.36]We have these big lush trees with all kinds of particle effects.
[25:52.38]It runs at like 12 frames a second.
[25:54.49]And you have to turn all that shit down to get it to even run.
[25:57.52]This came out of the box running at like 60 for me.
[26:04.11]We have to give credit where it's due.
[26:05.47]I have to.
[26:06.69]Okay.
[26:08.85]And look at this.
[26:10.69]This is... This is beautiful.
[26:12.29]I have... You got a 3090.
[26:13.55]3090 moment.
[26:15.17]Yeah.
[26:15.57]The glowing sea.
[26:16.25]You don't want to go through there.
[26:17.62]Ster, what do you have for a graphics card?
[26:20.52]280 Ti.
[26:21.84]Okay, so... And you're running at pretty much like 60, right?
[26:26.38]I have...
[26:28.60]I have issues.
[26:30.94]Generally speaking, I've got some issues.
[26:33.16]In general?
[26:33.62]It's nothing to do with the game.
[26:34.86]The game... I mean, we've got to give credit where credit's due, apparently.
[26:39.48]I am dead serious.
[26:40.34]I am so sick and fucking goddamn tired of games coming out that are AAA games that are... Whoa, look at how beautiful!
[26:47.87]And they run like shit and they crash and they don't even work.
[26:51.37]This is unheard of to me.
[26:52.79]When is the last time you played a game that came out in current year?
[26:57.27]Watch Dogs Legion.
[27:01.22]Okay, then yeah, what you're saying is valid.
[27:05.36]Any major AAA game I've played in the last two or three years always kind of ran like dog shit.
[27:09.22]Always.
[27:11.36]This game could suck.
[27:12.14]I don't know.
[27:12.50]We have no idea.
[27:14.60]Oh wait, what's this?
[27:20.37]Oops.
[27:21.59]I think we're going in the wrong direction.
[27:23.83]I gotta turn you up a little bit.
[27:27.15]We're going the wrong direction?
[27:28.11]Yeah, we gotta go this way.
[27:29.61]Watch out, there's Zeds.
[27:32.56]Okay, so there's special gear.
[27:34.32]Ooh.
[27:36.96]Alright, so we got... Oh, climb up stuff.
[27:43.78]What about Resident Evil 8?
[27:46.38]Yeah, Resident Evil 8 was alright too.
[27:48.28]But... Was that like 70 FOV?
[27:52.44]I ran out of... I need help.
[27:54.65]Help.
[27:55.55]You healthy?
[27:58.97]Why do I have no stamina?
[28:03.11]I have to take your inhibitor.
[28:05.12]Do I actually have to do that?
[28:09.82]I don't know.
[28:11.52]Oh, no.
[28:11.88]I got it.
[28:16.95]I think we've got to get in the building.
[28:18.17]Okay.
[28:18.87]Very cool.
[28:19.77]Up top, maybe?
[28:20.21]Watch out.
[28:20.47]They're climbing.
[28:21.03]We've got climbers.
[28:21.69]There's a book over there.
[28:35.25]He's running.
[28:35.79]He doesn't want anything to do with this.
[28:38.83]What?
[28:39.05]Nobody can do that.
[28:46.27]He was so scared.
[28:52.67]This game is really creepy.
[28:56.09]I feel like when we're interacting with NPCs, I feel like we're seeing two different things happening.
[29:00.99]That guy walked off the pole for me.
[29:04.46]Yeah, he teleported to the pole for me and then fell off.
[29:06.90]Oh, he ran across and then fell.
[29:11.06]Watch out.
[29:11.42]We're inside the quest area.
[29:13.34]Use your survivor sins.
[29:14.42]We have five minutes to do this, by the way, so actually don't mess around.
[29:17.67]Wait, what?
[29:18.19]Why?
[29:18.75]I don't know.
[29:19.03]It's timed.
[29:23.19]We start picking up stuff.
[29:24.43]We're going to be so under leveled by the time we get to the end game in the next few hours.
[29:28.73]We're not getting past level two at this rate.
[29:34.57]Wait, there's more stuff in here.
[29:36.91]Do you see this secret mine shaft?
[29:43.96]I have a mine shaft over here.
[29:46.50]Let's go.
[29:47.62]This is one of the hollows.
[29:49.68]Gotta be careful down here.
[29:50.46]Do we slide?
[29:51.54]I'm losing stamina.
[29:52.64]How do you slide?
[29:55.16]Is this gonna hurt?
[29:56.76]Oh shit, be careful.
[30:03.03]There's a dude.
[30:05.27]Wait, quest?
[30:06.35]All players required.
[30:07.23]We're doing a heist.
[30:08.59]We're doing a heist.
[30:09.09]Alright, just let him talk for a second until we even know what he's doing here.
[30:11.55]Great.
[30:12.53]Another water thief.
[30:14.14]Just what I need.
[30:15.66]Between thieves and infected, I'll be out of business soon.
[30:18.96]Alright, we're good.
[30:22.60]I'm here.
[30:23.32]You just do it.
[30:24.24]You're the host.
[30:30.63]My God.
[30:34.22]Okay.
[30:34.86]Secure the building.
[30:35.85]Find Hans, the hunter, before he drinks the poisoned water.
[30:40.29]Wait, we have to stop somebody from drinking water.
[30:45.95]Okay.
[30:47.03]That's quite the quest.
[30:48.39]You know what?
[30:48.85]Wait.
[30:49.75]As a streamer, I'm morally opposed to this.
[30:51.69]You need to stay hydrated.
[30:53.91]Okay.
[30:54.31]So, where are they?
[30:59.62]You know what's funny about games like this though?
[31:01.74]Okay, so take a look at your perspective.
[31:03.68]Like come over here.
[31:04.98]This is a hiding spot, right?
[31:06.67]Yeah.
[31:09.49]I'm hiding right now.
[31:11.23]This is the equivalent of like a three-year-old.
[31:14.81]What?
[31:16.27]Where'd you go?
[31:17.73]Oh, I see.
[31:18.17]That's funny.
[31:21.50]Okay, okay, ready?
[31:22.76]I'm gonna go do the thing.
[31:23.70]I'm gonna go into the corner here, and I'm gonna count to ten, and you be the three-year-old and find the best hiding spot in the room, okay?
[31:30.82]Okay.
[31:31.24]And we're gonna play, we're gonna do that routine.
[31:33.14]Okay.
[31:33.54]Alright, you ready?
[31:34.06]Okay, here we go!
[31:36.59]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!
[31:45.01]Here I come!
[31:46.93]And you gotta start like this.
[31:48.65]Okay, it's always the, okay...
[31:53.06]Wonder where they are.
[31:55.84]Where did he go?
[31:56.59]Hmm.
[31:59.63]Not under there.
[32:00.75]Oh, I don't know.
[32:02.47]I have no idea where they are.
[32:06.29]Did they fit in here?
[32:07.34]Oh, no way.
[32:10.86]Okay.
[32:12.12]I found ya!
[32:14.94]And then you have to go...
[32:19.66]Okay, and then and then you we have to do it again here.
[32:22.40]We go ready Here we go.
[32:24.29]Why do we have to do it again?
[32:25.11]1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Here I come Okay
[32:41.53]No, you're supposed to be in the same spot.
[32:44.11]The exact same spot.
[32:45.55]You did it wrong.
[32:46.71]I didn't know that was a joke.
[32:47.77]Oh, shit.
[32:48.21]No, that's dangerous.
[32:49.15]Get out of there.
[32:51.15]That's dangerous because that's in the drywall.
[32:53.37]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[32:53.99]Come out.
[32:54.25]Come out.
[32:54.51]Come out.
[32:54.69]Come out.
[32:55.11]Oh, my God.
[32:55.89]This is bad.
[32:57.29]Mom.
[32:57.63]Mom.
[32:58.53]Mom.
[33:00.33]Tim went in the drywall.
[33:01.43]I don't know where the fuck they went.
[33:02.47]Mom, I'm serious.
[33:03.19]Zombies.
[33:05.57]Help.
[33:05.99]We gotta go find them.
[33:06.95]Alright, let's go.
[33:09.19]Help.
[33:09.49]I'm lost.
[33:11.00]No, don't run in here.
[33:14.04]Why does that door not work?
[33:16.10]It doesn't work?
[33:18.74]That's a bait door.
[33:20.24]Alright, do the thing.
[33:25.14]What thing?
[33:25.58]Okay, if you stagger them.
[33:28.16]You can't do it to zombies.
[33:29.10]You can't carry a zombie.
[33:30.28]Yes, you can.
[33:36.08]I just did it.
[33:36.70]Okay, I did it.
[33:38.26]It's a lot harder.
[33:47.26]I'm not going to be able to get over that the whole time we're playing, by the way.
[33:50.28]It's just chivalry.
[33:56.27]Watch out.
[33:57.75]We got Z's.
[33:58.53]No, we can open this.
[34:00.37]Well, we got to leave.
[34:01.33]That's like leaving now.
[34:02.19]I think that's giving up.
[34:04.19]Are you sure?
[34:06.63]I'm collecting things.
[34:07.45]I found a Molotov.
[34:08.51]Oh, my God.
[34:08.88]There's a lot of stuff here.
[34:09.52]You're right.
[34:13.28]I found a common bottle.
[34:15.74]A brick.
[34:18.50]My opportunity... Wait, what?
[34:21.20]Use a... There's no friendly fire.
[34:22.90]This game got a full letter grade lowered.
[34:29.29]How do I use the brick?
[34:36.69]I'm a child.
[34:39.02]You can craft a pocket.
[34:41.34]Turn friendly fire off.
[34:42.30]Hey, go turn friendly fire off.
[34:45.44]How are we going to do any funny jokes if it's on?
[34:53.34]Was this it?
[34:53.94]I think we just have to... I think that was securing the building, what we just did.
[34:57.86]Parts for Carlos and his groundbreaking fence.
[35:01.42]Hope he's still waiting at the bazaar.
[35:02.84]Oh, I had the bottle in my hand.
[35:04.71]Aiden, how's it been, kid?
[35:06.59]We're good.
[35:06.87]How's the taste for city life?
[35:08.51]I've been here and there.
[35:10.41]You know, the best part is always happening in the center.
[35:13.17]Apparently we did it.
[35:14.17]I think we just leave, yeah.
[35:14.97]Because we secured the building.
[35:17.95]There's a time limit.
[35:23.08]Yeah, we only have three more minutes to leave the building.
[35:30.14]Okay.
[35:31.92]No help.
[35:33.52]Oh, shit.
[35:37.47]Don't skip this.
[35:38.13]I feel like there's something interesting gonna happen.
[35:41.82]I thought we were leaving.
[35:45.93]Oh.
[35:47.43]Yeah, who did we stop from drinking?
[35:50.13]I don't know, him?
[35:57.89]Okay, my head just hurt from that.
[36:00.62]Like, I thought that that was something wrong with the game.
[36:02.20]Now we're safe.
[36:03.14]I feel like you're pressing right arrow key on a YouTube video.
[36:10.98]Alright.
[36:11.28]Alright.
[36:11.52]Alright.
[36:33.36]Where is he?
[36:35.59]Hold on.
[36:36.95]Hold on.
[36:43.33]I'll tell him the truth.
[36:44.45]I won't.
[36:46.34]I won't.
[36:47.16]Wait, is he mad at us?
[36:48.68]Yeah.
[36:49.14]Wait, what happened?
[36:51.42]We missed really important context.
[36:53.10]Dude, even if your stamina goes to zero, don't stop.
[36:57.85]Don't stop left clicking.
[36:59.11]Double team him.
[37:01.14]With zero stamina, it doesn't matter.
[37:02.51]Don't fucking stop left-clicking.
[37:03.81]I have no weapon.
[37:10.77]So punch him.
[37:22.68]I'm swinging at him.
[37:25.66]Wait, now his head comes off?
[37:29.54]He had flour on him.
[37:31.30]I knew he was up to something.
[37:35.86]We killed this guy for a bag of flour.
[37:39.12]He's baking cookies with poison water.
[37:41.76]Didn't even use milk.
[37:44.72]Oh, this is gonna be a fun game.
[37:47.12]Okay.
[37:50.30]So, I mean, do we own this place now?
[37:53.99]The world is ours for the taking.
[37:55.80]15% off.
[37:57.72]Oh, never mind.
[37:58.70]I was like, what is this?
[38:01.00]Catch.
[38:06.11]You threw that from your ankle.
[38:08.77]You underhanded that to me.
[38:15.76]Hee hee.
[38:17.44]Oh, night has fallen and your immunity will go down.
[38:21.65]Oh, that's right.
[38:22.25]We have to go into the light.
[38:23.67]We have to be careful.
[38:24.45]Otherwise, we turn.
[38:31.13]We can leave the room now, I think.
[38:33.53]Wait, can we like wait for night to... Should we sleep?
[38:37.47]Maybe we should sleep.
[38:38.33]Yeah.
[38:40.44]Is there a bed down here?
[38:41.50]Or should we go up to... Yeah.
[38:43.50]Yeah.
[38:46.29]Oh, that's really important.
[38:47.05]Yes, we're infected.
[38:48.17]And we are slowly turning throughout the course of the game.
[38:50.57]That was something you missed in the first, like, ten minute cutscene.
[38:52.91]Sorry about that.
[38:53.43]I feel like if there was a bed, there would be one down there.
[38:58.70]You have to craft the... You guys are making things up.
[39:01.98]Are they making... Wait, what are they saying?
[39:05.76]What is... I got hurt.
[39:11.38]It's all imaginary.
[39:12.24]Yeah, there's nothing up here.
[39:13.10]There's no bed?
[39:17.46]I thought there was a bed.
[39:18.52]Usually there's like the... Yeah, it's right here, right?
[39:20.68]No?
[39:26.90]I mean, we can leave, but we have to be really careful.
[39:31.22]Okay.
[39:31.62]I mean, let's go.
[39:33.56]I swear to God there was a bed here.
[39:37.96]You don't want to be on the ground.
[39:38.80]I mean it.
[39:40.86]During nighttime, you actually don't want to be on the ground.
[39:42.52]That was in the tutorial.
[39:48.66]Did I get?
[39:50.68]I got something.
[39:51.28]He's not in the same room though, so I can't do it.
[39:53.96]What are you doing?
[39:55.43]I went back downstairs to go through the door.
[39:57.45]Why did I just get sucked over here?
[39:59.07]Oh, because I sucked you.
[40:01.69]We're not supposed to be on the floor.
[40:03.67]Let's go on the floor.
[40:04.93]We're not supposed to be on the floor.
[40:05.97]Climb.
[40:06.31]You gotta climb.
[40:07.07]Right on the street side.
[40:08.40]That's very impressive.
[40:12.38]Watch out.
[40:12.72]We got Zeds.
[40:15.24]Wait, somebody's yelling.
[40:17.71]Yeah, the zombies.
[40:18.77]No, no, no.
[40:18.99]There's a guy in that building.
[40:20.55]Somebody right there.
[40:21.99]66 meters away.
[40:22.58]Let's do it.
[40:25.42]Isn't it kind of rude to look in someone else's windows?
[40:28.82]This is like an office building.
[40:32.18]Yeah, it's still kind of weird.
[40:33.22]Right here.
[40:34.64]You see him?
[40:36.93]Where?
[40:38.63]He's hurt on that roof.
[40:39.87]Oh, he's hurt.
[40:40.81]Let's go help him.
[40:44.21]Over here.
[40:46.01]I'm going the other way.
[40:48.95]Oh, there's a special infected over here.
[40:51.19]No, don't go that way.
[40:51.73]Go this way.
[40:55.51]Watch out.
[40:55.79]We got biters.
[41:01.78]Oh, my God.
[41:02.36]It moves.
[41:03.60]Careful.
[41:04.04]Careful.
[41:04.34]Careful.
[41:04.58]Careful.
[41:05.94]Physics.
[41:07.68]Alright.
[41:08.50]What do we need to do?
[41:10.12]Immunity booster.
[41:11.19]Or a shroom booster.
[41:12.37]Or a shroom.
[41:15.75]I think I have.
[41:16.25]Do you have shrooms?
[41:17.57]I need.
[41:20.91]Nice we get a point for that You idiot We already got the experience Okay Okay, I got a parkour what are you gonna put your parkour point in I'm gonna put my parkour point into I Like firm grip
[41:50.08]Actually, no.
[41:51.14]I'm getting a firm grip first.
[41:52.54]Well, I don't have a point.
[41:54.22]You don't?
[41:55.40]No, I didn't get one.
[41:56.62]Oh, I love that.
[41:57.02]I probably ran through too much of the tutorial.
[41:59.84]Oh, easy.
[42:02.01]Easy with that.
[42:02.51]I'm just holding on to it for, you know, we get some Zeds following us.
[42:07.49]Okay.
[42:08.25]Some Zs, some zombies, some biters, some walkers, some crawlers.
[42:11.19]We're going to turn in like three minutes.
[42:14.77]What are we going to do?
[42:15.57]I don't know.
[42:15.85]We have to find a safe house.
[42:17.41]Oh, this way.
[42:19.44]Number one.
[42:19.80]We have to go to number one.
[42:22.12]Okay, let's go number one.
[42:25.26]Oh my god!
[42:25.94]I fucked it up!
[42:27.38]I'm fine.
[42:27.60]Are you trying to throw that at me?
[42:31.78]I couldn't jump with it.
[42:36.02]Oh, now I got a parkour skill point.
[42:37.57]Now I'm a firm gripper.
[42:40.07]I really don't want to alarm you or anything, but we really only have three minutes before we die.
[42:45.00]Wait, question mark.
[42:45.58]Somebody's screaming down there.
[42:50.02]Downstairs.
[42:50.40]We gotta go.
[42:54.72]Ow!
[42:56.69]Where'd you go?
[42:57.33]Oh.
[42:57.65]I went down.
[42:58.97]The other side of the building?
[43:01.01]It's down.
[43:01.51]Whatever it is, it's down, like, in the building.
[43:08.45]Your immunity is low.
[43:09.45]Use shrooms.
[43:11.14]Oh, shit.
[43:13.94]Oh yeah, we can just shroom.
[43:15.72]How do you shroom?
[43:17.79]Uh, mine's on my heal button.
[43:19.03]How do we get in there?
[43:30.07]We can see it.
[43:30.81]There's UV light in that direction.
[43:32.23]We can go there.
[43:32.76]There is.
[43:33.36]We can't get in there for some reason.
[43:34.30]Alright, we have to actually get back up top because we're going to get killed.
[43:36.92]That's a screamer.
[43:37.72]Don't.
[43:37.98]Oh my god, you're going to get us killed.
[43:40.66]Don't alert the screamer.
[43:41.68]Stop being such a bitch.
[43:43.36]It's tough.
[43:45.90]Get... I don't know where to go from here!
[43:53.15]What'd you do?
[43:54.21]I jumped on the... the... the... air conditioner.
[43:56.85]Okay.
[43:57.11]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:57.99]Gas cam.
[43:59.31]Let's go.
[44:01.56]180 meters.
[44:02.42]Immunity is low.
[44:06.54]What is shrooms on the minibar?
[44:08.86]Mine is H. I have no healing.
[44:11.96]Oh shit, there's an inhibitor container nearby.
[44:17.79]We're critical right now.
[44:18.79]We're absolutely critical.
[44:19.67]Up! Up! Up! Up!
[44:28.35]Why can I not grab this?
[44:31.35]This is bad.
[44:33.35]It changed my marker.
[44:35.89]We have to go to, we have 49 seconds to touch this UV thing over here.
[44:40.69]This way, follow me.
[44:47.07]Oh my god!
[44:50.59]You're falling behind, kid.
[44:52.59]Hey!
[44:55.04]I'm dead.
[45:00.20]Did you make it?
[45:01.34]Yeah.
[45:02.52]Can you come help me?
[45:05.18]I'm gonna have lunch with these guys.
[45:09.10]I'm dead.
[45:10.28]What happens?
[45:13.46]Are you actually dead?
[45:14.66]Yeah.
[45:17.91]I'm gonna respawn.
[45:19.65]It gives me the option to teleport you to me still.
[45:22.69]Oh.
[45:24.65]Can you do that?
[45:26.59]Wait, actually, don't do that.
[45:28.45]You're here.
[45:29.21]I'm here.
[45:32.07]Oh, okay.
[45:32.55]Cool.
[45:33.57]I don't know how to switch to my healing item.
[45:36.11]It's still on shrooms for me.
[45:39.09]Alright, we should probably make some weapons.
[45:43.80]UV bar?
[45:44.50]Ooh, that's kind of cool.
[45:47.04]Two.
[45:48.94]Ah, hold two.

[47:40.85]It's still nighttime, though.
[47:41.83]We have to go sleep.
[47:43.37]I think it... I don't care.
[47:45.67]Like, I'm... What do you mean you don't care?
[47:46.69]I'm kind of challenged.
[47:47.53]Like, I want to move in stealth.
[47:48.83]You know what I'm saying?
[47:49.85]Like, the moon's out.
[47:50.59]We can still see.
[47:52.93]You remember in Dying Light, actually, it was so dark you couldn't see, like, more than a foot.
[47:57.51]Let's pull your binoculars and start marking shit.
[48:00.15]Okay, there we go.
[48:00.71]Discover the old lumber mill.
[48:05.68]You definitely cannot see through those.
[48:07.48]Those are way too wide for your head.
[48:09.32]Same.
[48:10.30]What do we got up here?
[48:12.20]Look for things to mark.
[48:15.03]I have them all already.
[48:16.11]Oh, there's one out there.
[48:17.51]Yep, see?
[48:19.63]Alright.
[48:20.63]So I think we just have to choose which way we're going to go.
[48:23.19]Well, no, I'm doing the Reach the Memorial Square mission that this guy just gave us.
[48:28.01]Okay.
[48:29.07]Are you ready?
[48:30.89]Yeah.
[48:31.41]Let's move.
[48:33.91]Yeah.
[48:36.82]You're all crafted up.
[48:38.20]Alright.
[48:38.80]You think you can make this jump, Powder?
[48:44.10]I did, but for some reason I fell.
[48:46.14]Excuse me?
[48:47.82]That's classic, Powder.
[48:49.35]No, no, no.
[48:49.71]But like, honestly, excuse me.
[48:51.21]What happened?
[48:53.53]Why did I die?
[48:54.49]What happened to me?
[48:56.31]I got you.
[48:56.77]It's fine.
[48:57.95]You're not fast like the others.
[49:00.33]There's a zombie right behind you, Powder.
[49:01.71]Why did I delay my death?
[49:03.23]That was weird.
[49:08.99]weird's going on I'm telling you I tried to climb up and I couldn't okay are we climbing back up let's climb back up yeah I can't stand on this come on and from here we can go this way up
[49:38.54]Oh, we got a little hovel here.
[49:39.82]I wonder what's inside.
[49:44.53]Do you want to explore it?
[49:46.01]Yeah, I'm looking to explore it.
[49:47.37]Let's go.
[49:50.35]It looks like we're both having the same problem of how do you just go down?
[49:52.55]I have the whole tutorial.
[49:54.75]I was like, what button lets go?
[50:01.07]This is one of those pre-war buildings with four floors and no rooms.
[50:07.40]Nothing down here?
[50:11.58]Yep.
[50:11.96]We're on the ground floor again.
[50:14.41]Oh, wait.
[50:14.79]I can open this.
[50:18.89]Oh, yeah.
[50:19.47]We get guns in the police car.
[50:20.57]Alright, I got your back.
[50:21.95]Puppet's head's coming.
[50:24.49]Watch my back.
[50:27.49]Oh, dude!
[50:28.02]Jesus!
[50:29.02]Republic of Gamers!
[50:30.50]What?
[50:30.76]There's a howler over here.
[50:42.82]Okay, up here.
[50:51.47]Why did my... Okay.
[50:53.69]Why did my stamina just drop to zero?
[50:56.73]What did I do wrong?
[50:57.43]What happened?
[50:59.37]My stamina bar was at like 60% and it just went to zero.
[51:05.13]Stop saying that.
[51:07.21]Why?
[51:08.35]Because I don't... I haven't watched the show.
[51:11.53]If you saw two episodes, it's all you need to know.
[51:13.59]Okay.
[51:23.74]So from here, where do you want to?
[51:24.90]This way?
[51:26.00]Half of our life has gone.
[51:28.62]I know.
[51:29.00]We're not supposed to be doing what we're doing.
[51:30.28]Okay.
[51:32.72]We're supposed to have been sleeping.
[51:34.65]This is where we started.
[51:36.79]What?
[51:38.41]No, it is not?
[51:40.71]No, it's not.
[51:41.33]What?
[51:41.93]No way.
[51:43.07]No way.
[51:45.33]This is impossible.
[51:46.97]It's impossible.
[51:48.13]How is it impossible?
[51:49.33]They don't have a bed.
[51:50.29]How do we skip time?
[51:51.75]I can't believe it.
[51:56.86]I can't believe it, man.
[51:57.84]I really can't.
[51:59.72]How did we do that?
[52:05.21]Okay.
[52:05.45]We need to find... Okay.
[52:06.49]Okay.
[52:08.35]I'm taking the reins.
[52:09.71]Alright.
[52:10.17]You're my leader.
[52:10.75]What do I do?
[52:11.55]Mark on your map the bed over here.
[52:16.69]The bed over here.
[52:17.97]The green bed that's over here in the middle.
[52:20.53]If you go to your map, mark this.
[52:24.43]The green bed.
[52:25.81]No, we're going to do the history lesson.
[52:27.26]Shut up.
[52:27.56]I'm going.
[52:27.98]I'm taking the reins.
[52:29.16]I'm telling you, the game has told us over and over again not to play the game when it's nighttime.
[52:33.36]I'm taking the reins right now.
[52:34.88]Ugh.
[52:44.19]Can you keep up?
[52:45.71]I think so.
[52:46.15]Oh, look at this.
[52:50.27]We actually can open this, can't we?
[52:52.30]No.
[52:53.08]What?
[52:55.08]Bait quest box.
[52:56.34]You see down there?
[52:56.94]Do you see the marker?
[52:57.88]Mm-hmm.
[52:59.54]That's where we're going.
[53:01.04]Don't play this game at 3 a.m.
[53:05.89]No, don't.
[53:07.90]That's not something we can mark.
[53:08.70]There's a lot of zombies down there.
[53:11.88]Oh, what's the plan?
[53:12.90]Electrical station.
[53:13.58]Alright, the plan is we're going to go... Uh, well, we have to go that way.
[53:19.42]So should we jump on the X?
[53:21.89]Yeah.
[53:22.69]Alright, you go first.
[53:24.65]Alright.
[53:25.09]I'm going to show you how a pro does it.
[53:26.79]I went way too far.
[53:32.91]I'm fine.
[53:35.61]That's a howler.
[53:36.41]We got to go.
[53:37.21]We do actually have to go.
[53:40.13]Come on, Powder.
[53:48.22]You got this.
[53:48.74]You're going to keep doing that.
[54:02.33]We got UV light and everything.
[54:03.67]And there's a howler.
[54:06.26]Take out your sniper rifle.
[54:07.30]Take the shot.
[54:08.38]Alright, how do I throw a device?
[54:10.78]You gotta find something to throw, I'm pretty sure.
[54:13.61]Okay.
[54:13.85]Anybody screaming?
[54:18.29]Oh shit, we got Zeds.
[54:19.83]Somebody actually just screamed.
[54:20.91]Help me, Marina!
[54:27.64]Did you ever play Mischief Makers for N64?
[54:28.74]What?
[54:28.86]I feel like that's a game that you would have played.
[54:32.40]No, I have not.
[54:36.63]It's very good.
[54:37.67]Alright, so this person's... You're going backward.
[54:41.21]They're on the roof.
[54:42.41]Oh, you're... Okay, you're trying to help the person.
[54:45.10]I mean, we might as well do missions and shit.
[54:47.00]There's two howlers down here, dude.
[54:48.92]Just walk by them.
[54:51.86]Get up here.
[54:57.10]X. Press X. How do you blow that up?
[55:00.93]Oh, shit.
[55:01.35]Go.
[55:02.37]You had to press X.
[55:07.72]Oh, no.
[55:11.22]I'm going to die again, dude.
[55:12.10]I'm not kidding.
[55:19.48]Survivor has turned.
[55:21.10]Did you turn?
[55:22.74]No.
[55:24.28]Did I?
[55:25.06]No.
[55:25.48]That must be you.
[55:27.12]It's not me.
[55:27.68]It's not me.
[55:29.12]Oh, the person we were trying to save, maybe?
[55:30.86]Oh, okay.
[55:32.51]Come on, Powder.
[55:33.05]Silco's goons are coming.
[55:35.95]Stop saying that.
[55:40.23]Stay on mission.
[55:40.81]Down here, we got a question mark.
[55:41.71]No, I didn't want to grab this brick building.
[55:45.97]Come on, to the UV light up here.
[55:50.82]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[55:54.10]Oh, no.
[55:54.48]Go to the light.
[55:56.64]At the light.
[55:57.66]Breathe it in, quick.
[55:58.12]Okay.
[56:08.83]They're getting burned.
[56:11.19]They can't take the heat.
[56:12.91]And they shouldn't stand in the fire.
[56:14.12]Nice.
[56:14.68]Okay, we got it.
[56:15.84]Objective updated.
[56:20.56]Investigate the square.
[56:22.54]Use your game revision.
[56:24.34]So yeah, we have to investigate this area here?
[56:26.57]All players required to investigate this plaque.
[56:28.53]That's kind of going to get annoying.
[56:29.89]What did that say?
[56:33.99]Something detected?
[56:34.63]There's a plaque here.
[56:36.21]Oof, a lot of names on it.
[56:37.81]People died.
[56:41.95]This game sucks, bro.
[56:43.53]No, it doesn't.
[56:44.95]I'm really enjoying it.
[56:45.79]It actually is pretty good.
[56:47.57]I think the multiplayer connection is a little weird, but that's not... It looks okay for me.
[56:53.93]Are you having lag issues?
[56:56.22]It desyncs and it looks a little weird, but it's just making it more fun, to be honest.
[56:59.44]Okay, so now investigate the square.
[57:05.54]There's more stuff we have to press?
[57:08.24]Yeah, use your game revision.
[57:09.10]Okay, the thing right next to it.
[57:13.39]This is one of those locked containers somewhere over here.
[57:16.81]Yeah, we like both need to investigate the same thing.
[57:19.55]Yeah.
[57:20.43]Okay.
[57:21.12]Wait, didn't we do that?
[57:22.60]No, we didn't.
[57:23.56]Apparently not this one.
[57:25.24]Hold F and then press F and then press F again.
[57:27.30]What happened here?
[57:28.30]What happened in the last 10 years of PC games where they changed E to F?
[57:31.92]Have you noticed that?
[57:32.80]They changed E to F and they made you have to hold it.
[57:36.18]What happened there?
[57:37.23]I'm going to blame Sean Murray and No Man's Sky and all of his lies.
[57:40.85]Shots were fired.
[57:42.66]What?
[57:43.38]Is that person supposed to be in this cutscene?
[57:48.16]We're killing him.
[57:59.45]We are?
[58:01.37]Light the candle.
[58:03.07]I don't think this person is supposed to be in the cutscene.
[58:04.87]I think they just accidentally got through the barrier.
[58:11.51]All players required.
[58:13.53]Man, imagine playing with like 16 people.
[58:16.77]I actually found it funny.
[58:22.13]Okay, is this an actual flop?
[58:23.71]This is not a flop!
[58:25.17]Why are you guys saying flop?
[58:33.29]Okay, so now we got to go back to... Where are we going now?
[58:38.03]What's this forsaken store in front of us?
[58:40.17]You see that?
[58:42.89]Yeah, I do.
[58:44.47]Wait, the beep, beep, beep, the box detected.
[58:47.28]Box detected.
[58:48.42]Are you getting that over here?
[58:49.30]No, I'm not getting a box detected.
[58:52.16]It's like container detected.
[58:53.34]There's one of those G... What is it?
[58:58.14]The inhibitors?
[58:59.40]Yeah, I know.
[58:59.90]We can use our key on something here.
[59:04.73]When you're close to one of those locked chests, it goes like this.
[59:08.53]Yeah, it goes, box detected.
[59:12.94]I don't know.
[59:13.40]I don't see anything.
[59:14.36]I don't know where it is.
[59:15.44]You have to use your gamer sense.
[59:17.38]I'm gamer sensing as hard as I can.
[59:19.02]I mean, maybe it's in the Forsaken store.
[59:20.98]It might be.
[59:21.60]If you want to go to the Forsaken store.
[59:23.80]That's right.
[59:26.00]Bottom left icon.
[59:27.52]Oh, shit.
[59:28.02]Okay, it tells you how close you are.
[59:32.99]Oh, it does.
[59:34.09]Oh, we're playing hot and cold.
[59:35.89]Yes, when we walk towards the store.
[59:38.25]Actually, probably stealth this part.
[59:39.51]Okay.
[59:43.27]I don't want to alert any Zeds.
[59:46.95]There's one behind you.
[59:49.07]I opened up a trunk.
[59:50.13]Are you going to attack me?
[59:54.49]Oh, shit.
[59:56.09]Well, it didn't work.
[60:02.68]Go back to the light.
[60:05.64]Embrace the light.
[60:08.08]We're going to get a redo.
[60:09.66]Fine.
[60:12.32]I got a decoy.
[60:13.00]I don't know how to throw it.
[60:13.98]How do you get a weapon?
[60:15.82]What?
[60:17.94]When did I have this?
[60:23.01]I've had this the whole time?
[60:24.39]It's always G. It's not G. Alright, we have to open this crate.
[60:33.37]Alright.
[60:40.71]There's one guy here.
[60:41.51]We don't have to worry about this.
[60:44.21]I'm gaining park work.
[60:46.83]Standing still?
[60:48.43]Middle mouse.
[60:49.05]Okay, hold on.
[60:49.73]Hold on.
[60:51.19]I'm going to throw the thing.
[60:52.01]You ready?
[60:52.57]Wait, hold on.
[60:52.95]I have a skill point.
[60:54.35]I stood there.
[60:55.23]I survived the night.
[60:56.40]Air kick.
[60:59.36]I'm getting air kick.
[61:00.86]I'm a bit of an air kicker.
[61:04.47]We're killing him.
[61:06.61]You missed.
[61:06.99]Yeah, I don't want to break my weapon.
[61:10.41]It's daytime.
[61:11.01]See, we survived the night.
[61:11.91]We're good.
[61:12.85]Would you get extra EXP?
[61:14.77]Yeah.
[61:15.05]That's cool.
[61:17.25]Okay, so let's go find the thing.
[61:18.69]Alright, get... So we don't get collapsed on us.
[61:23.16]Okay.
[61:24.36]Find the thing.
[61:26.26]What is that?
[61:26.70]It's my noisemaker.
[61:28.22]Find the thing.
[61:28.76]Go, go, go, go, go.
[61:31.90]It's this way.
[61:35.05]Container nearby.
[61:37.21]Nine meters away.
[61:37.85]There's so many people here.
[61:39.01]They're not people anymore.
[61:44.13]Where is it?
[61:44.47]It's down that way.
[61:46.83]It's got to be in one of these cars or something.
[61:49.62]Get on top of this.
[61:50.18]Yeah, it's over here.
[61:50.78]A little bit further this way.
[61:57.52]And then jump onto the sign.
[61:59.26]And then we go that way.
[62:10.55]You looking for it?
[62:11.17]I'm gonna die.
[62:11.77]I'm gonna die.
[62:12.85]You're gonna die?
[62:14.45]What happened?
[62:15.80]What are you doing?
[62:18.12]I'm killing Zed.
[62:19.46]What is happening over there?
[62:20.40]Remember me.
[62:21.36]What is going on over there?
[62:23.02]Remember me.
[62:24.56]Why do you have an infinite supply of these things?
[62:29.23]What?
[62:31.13]Watch out.
[62:31.45]Somebody on the roof.
[62:32.49]Somebody got sick of you.
[62:35.66]It's like, who's the fuck throwing all those?
[62:37.46]This is just, we're making a skate video.
[62:39.68]This is what a skate video would be like in this period here.
[62:45.32]Oh, you're just filming me?
[62:46.50]Yeah, alright, it's over here.
[62:47.80]Oh, shit.
[62:50.68]Oh, you get that, bro?
[62:51.24]You get that on camera?
[62:52.14]I did.
[62:53.10]I'm uploading that to ZTube.
[62:56.76]ZTube.
[62:57.36]Alright, it's definitely, I don't know where it is, but like, we keep getting closer.
[63:01.53]Fuck you.
[63:04.88]Where is it?
[63:06.26]15, 13, 12, 10 meters.
[63:08.64]I found some shrooms up here.
[63:10.78]10, 9, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3.
[63:13.46]It's like on top of me somewhere right here.
[63:17.11]Help me.
[63:17.49]Help me.
[63:17.79]Wishy bombs.
[63:19.59]I might have thrown them off.
[63:22.11]It's like, where is it?
[63:22.91]It's right there somewhere.
[63:24.77]It's got to be in the car.
[63:28.48]Oh, it's in the subway station.
[63:31.74]Okay, we're going under.
[63:33.48]Let's go.
[63:36.14]Make sure you turn on your flashlight.
[63:39.14]Stealth takedown.
[63:40.79]I choked him out.
[63:41.91]We gotta pick this stuff up.
[63:42.71]I need to make some more heals.
[63:43.57]Oh, it's right here.
[63:46.63]Yep.
[63:46.97]Nice.
[63:47.73]So what's in it?
[63:50.91]Anything good?
[63:51.21]A defibrillator.
[63:51.90]Why is that guy burning to death in the subway?
[63:55.26]Ooh, nice.
[63:55.70]We need these things.
[63:57.66]This thing actually, we have to collect these.
[64:00.18]Yeah.
[64:01.56]That's when your max stamina increases.
[64:04.64]Hey, hold on.
[64:05.68]Let me heal you.
[64:08.43]You're taking a lot of damage out there, Gas Camp.
[64:10.71]Actually, we should.
[64:11.65]Let me craft a little bit here.
[64:13.19]This game is fun.
[64:14.83]I need honey.
[64:18.15]I can give you some honey.
[64:20.09]Stop.
[64:23.24]Regenerates a substantial part of your immunity.
[64:26.54]Cool.
[64:28.78]arms in front of me what are you doing huh what are you doing when you like crouch and look down and move left and right your arms are just like I don't know I'm like really coming well you got you're holding a weapon so it's probably not doing it oh I think you press x to put it away did you turn your uh fov up yeah alright let's get out let's get out of here I don't want to throw up wait we got zeds
[64:54.78]You're going to say that every time.
[64:56.36]We should scavenge down here.
[64:57.82]Yeah, that's true.
[64:58.76]That's a lot of stuff.
[64:59.78]Alright.
[65:00.62]Let's just clear out these Zeds.
[65:02.02]You're going to say that every time we see a new room of zombies, aren't you?
[65:06.34]We got fighters.
[65:10.11]That is like the E3 party audio of all these single player games, by the way.
[65:15.15]Watch out, walkers.
[65:15.91]We got Zeds.
[65:17.03]Fighters incoming.
[65:19.41]I just love how in every zombie show, they have to call them something different, and they can't do what someone else has already done, so they can't just be zombies.
[65:26.93]They can't be walkers.
[65:28.13]They have to be like... I don't know.
[65:31.99]You hear some weird ones.
[65:32.89]How do you throw?
[65:36.43]How do I throw multi?
[65:39.33]You have to have one on middle mouse button.
[65:41.87]If you have one.
[65:43.27]Got it.
[65:47.10]Got it.
[65:48.70]I love the smell of human flesh.
[65:52.74]I thought they weren't humans anymore.
[65:54.32]Huh?
[65:56.73]They aren't.
[65:58.05]They just have our flesh.
[65:59.17]Get off my buddy.
[66:07.11]What the fuck?
[66:07.99]Why are they... What did you just do?
[66:10.93]That's not what fire extinguishers do.
[66:12.93]They don't light on fire.
[66:14.93]What happened?
[66:16.49]I hit a fire extinguisher and flames were coming out of it and it blew up.
[66:21.55]It's contents under pressure, dude.
[66:24.11]But there was literal flames.
[66:28.46]Here, let me heal you up.
[66:30.84]What is making this like...
[66:33.01]It's kind of annoying me.
[66:34.77]I don't know.
[66:35.37]Why is this guy still here?
[66:36.94]Is this guy alive?
[66:40.72]Help me kill this guy.
[66:41.82]No, I'm scavenging.
[66:44.50]Oh, we got some alcohol.
[66:45.24]We're going to party while... There's three... What?
[66:48.56]Oh, God!
[66:49.22]You keep him busy.
[66:50.28]Oh, never mind.
[66:51.30]I thought it was a bomb.
[67:00.27]Where are these people coming from?
[67:04.90]I think they're using the... Bro, let's... Grab what you can and we gotta go.
[67:09.14]That reaction was like, I'm about to crash.
[67:13.14]I'm, like, about to crash my car.
[67:14.86]Like, oh my god!
[67:17.99]Bro.
[67:18.13]Alright, we've scavenged pretty much everything we can scavenge from down here.
[67:28.15]I haven't.
[67:30.03]I'm on low health.
[67:31.38]Are you?
[67:32.48]No, don't crush the mushrooms.
[67:33.90]What am I doing?
[67:34.72]Oops.
[67:35.02]Actually, I wanted to do that.
[67:38.06]Do these guys have honey on them?
[67:42.98]Oh, that beeping that you're saying is so annoying is your immunity being critical.
[67:46.52]I mean, I just took a mushroom.
[67:48.44]Because we're in the dark.
[67:50.44]Oh, well, I just heard it.
[67:51.26]We gotta go.
[67:54.23]We actually do have to go, but we need to actually be careful because we're low on health and shit.
[68:03.33]I need some honey.
[68:05.52]Oh, I do have a heal.
[68:07.08]How critical is your health?
[68:08.76]Uh, very low.
[68:09.42]I mean, I keep healing you and I don't have any left.
[68:11.56]Let me, let me return the favor here.
[68:12.98]Okay.
[68:13.44]Okay.
[68:14.00]Alright.
[68:14.80]Thank you.
[68:16.32]Okay.
[68:17.86]You're low on health.
[68:19.36]Stop doing that.
[68:25.38]Why is it doing that noise every five seconds?
[68:30.95]Okay, where are we going?
[68:31.71]Where are we going?
[68:33.15]Okay.
[68:33.39]Wait, hold on.
[68:34.57]We need to go to the mission marker and find a place to sleep.
[68:39.42]It's daytime.
[68:40.14]Why would we need to sleep?
[68:41.12]Because we're tired.
[68:42.24]I'm not tired.
[68:46.38]I can keep going.
[68:48.29]Alright, so where's our marker currently?
[68:51.73]We don't have a quest.
[68:53.11]We have one that we can do.
[68:54.25]We have Meet Hakann.
[68:55.75]Oh, that's the guy.
[68:57.13]Yeah.
[68:57.81]Where is that?
[68:58.65]That's over here.
[68:59.37]We can go to that.
[69:00.65]Let's go.
[69:04.50]We've already met him.
[69:06.20]Well, we have to do more missions with him.
[69:07.76]It's like GTA.
[69:08.32]Yeah, I'm bored of him.
[69:21.72]Oh, we got enforcers.
[69:23.54]Is that a bad thing or a good thing?
[69:26.06]Ah, they've got spears.
[69:27.72]Hey, hold on.
[69:28.16]Hold on.
[69:28.66]Hold on.
[69:29.06]Come back here behind this bush, Gas Can.
[69:30.68]Okay.
[69:32.42]What's the plan here?
[69:34.00]We need their weapons.
[69:35.50]I think we do need their weapons.
[69:37.92]You get behind one, I get behind one.
[69:39.42]Let's see where they're situated here.
[69:41.10]We've got this one facing us, and then we've got one... Okay, we've got two not facing us.
[69:47.76]I don't think we actually can.
[69:48.92]It's not letting me.
[69:52.14]Yes, we can.
[69:52.62]No, I meant like the actual instant kill takedown.
[70:01.22]He has so many knives coming out of his head.
[70:03.72]Oh my god, I'm going to die.
[70:07.26]Look.
[70:08.76]He's almost dead.
[70:09.18]Kill the guy on the ledge.
[70:13.14]Don't push him off because now we can't loot him.
[70:15.48]He fell.
[70:15.90]Well, we can go down there.
[70:16.94]I'm going down to loot him.
[70:17.88]Kill the guys up here that are trying to attack me.
[70:24.16]I'm trying to loot this guy.
[70:29.75]They're not trying to attack me.
[70:30.85]Can I make anything?
[70:34.56]Oh, easy.
[70:36.82]Get some?
[70:38.44]Get some is what he said.
[70:41.80]He had shoes on him.
[70:43.36]He didn't have a weapon on him.
[70:44.58]He only had shoes.
[70:47.19]This guy's trying to dodge my attack so much.
[70:49.83]What the fuck?
[70:51.71]Loot that guy too, please.
[70:59.01]He didn't die.
[70:59.95]He's still alive.
[71:02.37]Dude, what the fuck?
[71:03.61]Stop dodging.
[71:04.51]This guy's... I need healing.
[71:10.56]Oh my fucking god.
[71:11.60]Okay, well.
[71:12.70]What is my character doing?
[71:17.62]You push this one off too?
[71:18.72]I was trying to throw knives at him and he killed himself.
[71:21.18]Let's see if he has anything on him.
[71:29.61]Oh, he does have a spear on the ground.
[71:30.75]Holy shit.
[71:31.59]He's got a spear.
[71:33.45]Oh my goodness.
[71:34.71]It's a throwing spear.
[71:35.69]An opportunity weapon.
[71:38.90]Where is that?
[71:41.10]I didn't get one.
[71:44.38]Oh, come up here.
[71:44.94]There's a throwing spear on this guy.
[71:46.98]He's not using it anymore.
[71:48.02]Oh shit.
[71:48.42]This is awesome.
[71:48.98]Okay.
[71:49.12]Where are you?
[71:52.30]I gotta heal first.
[71:53.84]Come up here.
[71:54.52]I also... I really... I have no healies.
[71:57.04]We have to find honey and stuff.
[72:03.78]Okay.
[72:05.04]Keep your spear out.
[72:06.14]Because we need to use it.
[72:07.62]I crafted it and I dropped it.
[72:08.96]There's another spear up here.
[72:11.48]I have one already.
[72:13.20]I think you can only hold one.
[72:14.71]Yeah.
[72:14.95]Alright, let's go.
[72:16.69]Well, hold on.
[72:17.07]Hold on.
[72:17.45]You see that guy down there?
[72:19.67]Three.
[72:19.95]Two.
[72:20.95]Wait.
[72:21.25]Hold on.
[72:22.27]Three.
[72:22.75]Yep.
[72:23.49]Two.
[72:24.53]One.
[72:25.19]Action.
[72:25.41]That was pretty sick.
[72:28.13]I'm not going to lie.
[72:28.93]That was really cool.
[72:29.81]Let's go steal his stuff.
[72:31.25]He's definitely dead.
[72:33.82]He was just like, he was trying to cover up the graffiti.
[72:37.70]Is that what he really was doing?
[72:39.69]What the fuck?
[72:41.03]Oh, medicine.
[72:41.65]He had two heals on him.
[72:43.79]Yeah, we don't need to find honey.
[72:45.47]We just need to kill enforcers.
[72:48.01]I don't have that in my inventory.
[72:51.01]I can heal you.
[72:51.61]Come over here.
[72:55.37]Oh, no, you're good.
[72:56.31]No, I'm good.
[72:58.59]Let's keep going.
[73:01.71]Here, get their attention.
[73:06.38]He didn't throw it far enough, I don't think.
[73:15.52]Alright.
[73:16.02]That barely hurt this guy.
[73:17.76]Probably a special effect.
[73:20.68]The explosion, I mean.
[73:22.10]They're all feeling pretty okay.
[73:25.18]Spears probably do so much damage just using it.
[73:34.01]Is there a way to charge up a swing?
[73:35.21]You probably learn it later, I assume, right?
[73:37.58]Yeah.
[73:38.08]I don't think we can yet.
[73:40.28]I think we got to do like the main quest.
[73:42.64]I know.
[73:42.94]We keep getting too distracted.
[73:43.96]We really do.
[73:44.48]Oh yeah.
[73:44.98]There's another spear here.
[73:49.07]What's the guy doing?
[73:55.45]Okay, let's go, please.
[73:56.77]Okay.
[73:57.74]This is like the starting area we were in.
[74:00.20]This game reminds me of a video game.
[74:02.64]We're gonna go speak to Hakann.
[74:06.24]At that point, wait.
[74:08.00]Oh, I think we have combat points.
[74:09.76]I have one.
[74:11.81]I don't.
[74:12.95]Perfect dodge.
[74:13.51]You have the XP bonus.
[74:19.01]Ooh, I like that.
[74:19.63]I'm gonna do air kick.
[74:22.49]Are you serious?
[74:31.68]Are you looking at?
[74:34.77]Hold on.
[74:36.27]Crouch.
[74:36.93]You hear these guys talking?
[74:39.99]Kind of.
[74:41.69]Where are they?
[74:45.12]They're just saying the same thing over and over again for me.
[74:48.32]Are they?
[74:48.52]Got a hammer?
[74:49.10]Let's get closer.
[74:49.66]Got a hammer?
[74:57.57]We got two, yeah.
[74:59.36]We can open there.
[75:00.56]Why would you kick it open?
[75:02.78]Wait, somebody's about to blow a horn?
[75:15.59]What's with the horn?
[75:18.87]I don't know what you're talking about.
[75:20.37]What's taking so long?
[75:21.41]There was just a horn indicator on the screen.
[75:24.59]Like they were going to go...
[75:28.10]Oh, they're going to rally the troops.
[75:32.40]I mean, these are like tough guys.
[75:33.38]This guy's wearing camo.
[75:38.14]Uh, lots of stuff over in the corner.
[75:40.85]You can craft a new item.
[75:42.89]Ooh, what is it?
[75:43.79]You can't craft a... What new item?
[75:51.45]We got a question mark over here.
[75:52.60]You can't craft any new items, lying game.
[76:02.59]Want to go to this question mark?
[76:03.79]Yeah, I'm just getting the loot, man.
[76:05.15]We got a blue over here.
[76:06.53]Alright, what's this?
[76:08.23]Is it a random?
[76:09.23]Let's go to this blue.
[76:11.06]I kind of like how they just added random like stranger quests like GTA.
[76:16.92]It's another bandit.
[76:18.04]We got to chase this guy.
[76:21.62]It hurts so much.
[76:26.48]Oh, it is a bandit.
[76:30.16]It is just a bandit quest.
[76:36.19]Why can't I pick it up?
[76:39.21]What the fuck was that?
[76:41.31]You can't pick it up after they're lit.
[76:42.89]I feel like I just got out with my life.
[76:44.85]That was like my life flashed before my eyes.
[76:50.63]What?
[76:50.99]Holy shit.
[76:53.19]My god, dude.
[76:54.93]We gotta get Spider-Man.
[76:56.91]I can't climb that fast.
[76:59.72]This shit is fucking...
[77:02.14]I'm going to cut him off.
[77:03.46]He fell.
[77:04.14]What?
[77:05.34]He fell.
[77:06.83]I fell.
[77:09.23]I got him.
[77:09.51]I got him.
[77:09.73]I got him.
[77:09.95]I got him.
[77:11.27]Oh, shit.
[77:14.09]I didn't get him.
[77:14.57]I'm out of stamina.
[77:15.93]He's still going.
[77:16.57]Did I get him?
[77:22.26]I got him.
[77:25.86]Okay, I'm coming.
[77:26.60]Oh, no.
[77:28.08]I alerted the horde.
[77:28.76]My hand.
[77:33.09]I didn't loot him yet.
[77:34.31]I didn't loot him.
[77:34.85]I don't have any weapons.
[77:36.60]Do I have a weapon?
[77:37.76]I got him.
[77:38.16]I got him.
[77:39.16]Wait, I need a weapon.
[77:39.72]You just have to loot it.
[77:40.46]1, 2, 3, 4 cycles your weapons.
[77:43.80]Inventory, you can equip weapons.
[77:45.06]You probably keep picking them up and not realize them.
[77:49.16]Okay.
[77:51.74]Oh, Jerma.
[77:53.60]Powder.
[77:54.62]Come up here.
[77:58.46]There are people every 10 feet...
[78:02.55]Why are these people having a birdhouse?
[78:08.53]Why were these guys wearing ski masks?
[78:11.75]I don't... They were both up here wearing ski masks, tending to their beehives.
[78:16.38]Oh, wait, because they don't want to get stung in the face.
[78:17.96]That makes sense.
[78:20.30]That doesn't make sense.
[78:22.22]Oh, yeah, we got chamomile and honey.
[78:24.32]That's what they're doing.
[78:24.99]They're healing up.
[78:25.85]Okay.
[78:27.31]Oh, you see this?
[78:27.89]There's a police car down there.
[78:28.83]A couple Zeds on it.
[78:30.91]No, I didn't want to take the inhaler!
[78:33.67]Oh my god, I probably needed to use that at some point.
[78:35.85]Important.
[78:41.63]Let me put this stuff on my bar.
[78:44.34]Okay, I have two weapons.
[78:48.20]Okay.
[78:51.10]I'm gonna get in this police car.
[78:52.86]There's so much shit up here though, look at all this stuff.
[78:57.11]There's so much stuff.
[79:05.48]There's like shrooms.
[79:06.46]There's beehives.
[79:09.54]These guys had a little thing going on up here, huh?
[79:12.95]Yeah.
[79:14.97]Looks like they really figured this whole thing out.
[79:18.41]I think there's gas in here.
[79:19.93]They had an axe.
[79:21.79]They had a birdhouse.
[79:22.73]How's the axe?
[79:23.23]You know, it's a raggedy.
[79:25.64]It's a ragged chopper.
[79:26.68]You know what I'm talking about.
[79:27.48]That's not bad.
[79:29.24]19 damage.
[79:32.96]Okay, let's try the police car.
[79:38.07]Okay, I'll distract him and you open it.
[79:40.09]Where's the police car?
[79:41.41]Right in front of us in the middle of the road.
[79:42.79]Oh, I see.
[79:43.33]Okay.
[79:43.89]Yeah, I'm going to distract him.
[79:47.56]How come I couldn't kick that guy?
[79:48.54]I tried to do my kick.
[79:49.24]I'm lowering him away.
[79:51.24]Get in there.
[79:54.64]Yep, I can do it.
[79:56.04]I'm keeping him off you.
[79:56.76]It's a lockpick.
[79:57.28]It's a lockpick.
[79:57.74]It's a lockpick.
[79:58.80]I can't open it.
[79:59.26]I have to do the lockpick.
[80:00.12]We have to kill these guys.
[80:00.96]Okay, I got you.
[80:08.96]That what?
[80:09.38]What?
[80:09.96]That was it?
[80:10.76]That was the sound?
[80:16.16]Dude, watch my back!
[80:17.62]They're all fighting me!
[80:18.84]You have one person over there attacking you!
[80:22.35]Dude, watch my frickin' back!
[80:25.79]Keep him off me.
[80:31.69]I can do that.
[80:32.29]You handle the car.
[80:32.95]Keep him off me while I do my work.
[80:34.79]I'm out of stamina.
[80:40.50]I almost got it.
[80:46.68]Get it?
[80:47.40]There's a snake in here.
[80:48.26]Get it.
[80:49.36]Well, hold on.
[80:49.78]Get rid of these last two people.
[80:51.32]Alright.
[80:52.92]We're in the clear.
[80:53.52]Oh, oh, oh.
[80:55.94]Leather.
[80:56.98]Leather.
[80:58.68]Leather.
[80:59.08]That was it.
[81:06.26]Yeah, I don't know if we're being gate-capped.
[81:09.08]We can't find guns in cop cars.
[81:12.72]Hey, what's this place?
[81:18.45]We're getting distracted every five seconds.
[81:20.23]Yeah, it's the terminal.
[81:23.29]The main terminal.
[81:31.86]Oh my god.
[81:36.44]Okay.
[81:36.56]Are we about to do the first story mission of the game?
[81:41.43]Oh, you went to Hakann?
[81:42.97]He's the other way.
[81:45.53]Let's go.
[81:46.03]Dude, we've been going the wrong direction.
[81:49.06]No, we're fine.
[81:49.66]We got a little distracted.
[81:51.26]We got a whole bunch of honey.
[81:52.18]We got a whole bunch of heals.
[81:53.10]Like, we're equipped.
[81:53.74]We know how the game works.
[81:55.16]Like, it's all smooth sailing from here.
[81:56.54]No more distractions.
[81:57.54]We're running.
[81:58.00]It's parkour.
[81:59.65]Here to Sunday.
[82:00.94]I hear people talk and ignore them.
[82:02.70]What?
[82:03.36]They're funny NPCs we can go kill.
[82:05.96]Somebody's blowing their horn.
[82:06.76]See?
[82:13.68]ADHD should be illegal.
[82:18.51]Okay.
[82:20.03]Oh, I discovered the Dark Hollows.
[82:25.15]There's a tank down there.
[82:27.00]A tank?
[82:27.66]Yeah.
[82:28.48]Oh, we could really use that thing.
[82:29.56]Maybe we can get, like, mail?
[82:31.34]Wait, is that an Omega Zed?
[82:33.33]It looks like an Omega Zed.
[82:34.91]Is that Big Bertha?
[82:38.37]There's explosives down there?
[82:39.93]What should we do?
[82:42.17]This is just, like, that one scene in that one show.
[82:45.16]Yeah, like, the Tyrant is down there.
[82:47.16]I got a Molotov.
[82:48.06]Should we just throw it over there and see what happens?
[82:54.79]You completely missed.
[82:55.63]You're supposed to be the gamer.
[82:58.63]I didn't know how far they throw.
[83:00.15]Here we go.
[83:07.00]Alright.
[83:07.28]Is it going to blow up the... Oh, the propane tank is still not blown up.
[83:15.87]Yikes.
[83:17.37]There it goes.
[83:17.85]There it goes.
[83:18.79]Chain reaction.
[83:20.43]Oh, whoa, dude.
[83:21.55]Nice.
[83:22.52]Wait.
[83:23.86]That guy's flying.
[83:27.78]There goes another one.
[83:28.62]Another one.
[83:32.34]I'm not sure if we heard him or not.
[83:38.83]Okay, so... They're climbing.
[83:41.61]Alright, they're climbing.
[83:42.73]I'm frozen.
[83:43.35]What do we do?
[83:43.83]Alright, let's go back.
[83:45.62]I don't think we can do that right now.
[83:47.20]I think we can.
[83:47.94]I think you're giving up.
[83:49.72]It's a tyrant down there.
[83:50.84]We don't have a gun or anything.
[83:52.80]There's more explosives.
[83:54.36]Alright, go for it.
[83:55.50]Ready?
[83:55.86]Oh my god.
[83:57.78]Ready?
[83:59.36]One, two... Wait, I'm not ready.
[84:00.84]I'm not... Alright, I'm waiting.
[84:06.48]When do you think you'll be ready?
[84:07.54]I'm just curious.
[84:09.15]Okay, I'm going.
[84:10.09]I'm going.
[84:10.69]I'm going.
[84:11.25]Alright, going.
[84:12.25]Power attacks cannot be blocked.
[84:16.89]Alright, what was here?
[84:17.71]Something in the tank.
[84:24.06]Holy shit.
[84:24.52]Okay, what is it?
[84:26.85]Open it up.
[84:27.89]Dude.
[84:33.50]There's something we can do with the tank.
[84:36.54]The back of the tank.
[84:41.64]They're all coming for me.
[84:42.34]See if you can get it.
[84:43.38]I'm hurting.
[84:44.68]The back of the tank, I don't see anything.
[84:46.34]At the back of the tank, there's like a lever you can pull.
[84:50.59]A lever?
[84:51.89]Actually, you distract him.
[84:53.57]Are you talking about the spear?
[84:54.71]There's a lever here.
[84:56.55]God damn it.
[84:58.67]At the back of the tank, right at the very back.
[85:00.27]At the butt of the tank, there's like a lever.
[85:04.61]I'm gonna die.
[85:06.17]You alright?
[85:06.49]Alright, just run away.
[85:08.55]Run away.
[85:11.37]Just get out.
[85:13.29]I keep pressing E to use.
[85:16.29]And I keep kicking things.
[85:17.59]Just rebind it.
[85:23.75]Can I craft, like, a bomb or something?
[85:25.63]I'm gonna craft some knives.
[85:33.68]Just leave them.
[85:36.31]I mean, we already did.
[85:37.79]We committed to this bullshit.
[85:41.91]Is nobody here?
[85:42.33]Are you kidding me?
[85:43.75]I think I can get it.
[85:44.23]Oh, my God.
[85:47.53]Oh, my God.
[85:48.17]Oh, my God.
[85:49.84]Oh, my God.
[85:51.70]I'm going to get it.
[85:54.50]What is it?
[85:56.30]Rations.
[85:58.86]That's a hard lock.
[85:59.74]Oh, no.
[86:00.12]Don't do it.
[86:01.92]Hard lock?
[86:02.34]Alright.
[86:03.56]Help me.
[86:04.20]Just protect me.
[86:12.91]How do I throw this?
[86:14.07]Ignite it?
[86:14.49]I can't ignite it.
[86:15.29]Why not?
[86:15.85]You have to hold X. Alright, watch out.
[86:27.50]I think we can just clear it.
[86:28.28]Just clear it out.
[86:30.44]I'm clearing.
[86:33.67]The Tyrant left.
[86:37.75]That's good for us.
[86:53.25]Are you breathing in chemicals somewhere?
[87:01.31]Oh, this one's a lockpick as well.
[87:03.51]Alright, this is perfect.
[87:04.84]Loot everything.
[87:07.54]Don't read this comment, Jerma.
[87:08.72]What?
[87:10.90]You... Oh, man.
[87:15.40]This is actually cool.
[87:18.40]I'm breaking all my lockpicks.
[87:20.70]Somebody said, press C when you land to break your fall.
[87:24.34]I can't, I can't do this.
[87:26.08]Oh shit, how many?
[87:27.00]I think I have one.
[87:27.64]I have one left.
[87:29.76]Where, okay, where would you see the most non-resistance?
[87:33.20]I didn't see anything.
[87:36.79]Did you do the ambulance?
[87:41.41]Shit.
[87:50.55]Holy shit, what the hell?
[87:53.17]Yeah, we're just like not good enough to do very hard yet.
[87:56.85]I'm not getting anything.
[88:02.48]Oh my God.
[88:03.08]I got it.
[88:07.80]Holy shit, I got it.
[88:09.64]What a gamer it was all the way to the right.
[88:13.14]Dust filter.
[88:15.00]Solid shoes and rations.
[88:17.44]A bolted bludgeon 28 damage.
[88:21.56]Yeah, I feel like we're being gatekept from guns.
[88:24.27]You don't find it in the armored carrier.
[88:27.25]Come on, man.
[88:27.91]Didn't you say there was another thing to open?
[88:31.71]This one here, too.
[88:33.50]Alright, let me see if I can get this.
[88:43.02]Trust me when I say this.
[88:44.37]I'm the lockpick guy from now on.
[88:46.49]I trust you.
[88:52.44]Please play Sam and Max VR.
[88:54.94]Well, I put VR in the box and it's in the closet now, so it's not gonna happen.
[89:00.24]I do own the game, though, so eventually you'll see it.
[89:02.77]Okay, can we, like, get in here?
[89:13.11]There's a random person over there.
[89:15.46]Hey, can we make it to this main quest right up here?
[89:17.54]Meet Hakann?
[89:18.24]Yeah, let's... Okay.
[89:20.46]That's enough.
[89:21.75]We've been playing for an hour and a half, and I know we're having a lot of fun.
[89:24.07]This is actually a really good time.
[89:26.07]But... We gotta... We can't just not do the whole game.
[89:29.47]We're having a good time, but we need to, like, put it to an end right now and, like, talk to this main quest guy.
[89:33.37]Yeah.
[89:34.41]Have you ever played Castlevania Symphony?
[89:36.81]Nope.
[89:36.93]Nope.
[89:44.27]I feel like I lived it, you know, I just like you playing the games kind of boring.
[89:48.25]There might be.
[89:49.75]Did you play Vampire Survivors?
[89:52.69]No, you shouldn't.
[89:55.30]That's a Ster game.
[89:56.68]I think we talked about it.
[89:57.86]That's a Ster game.
[90:01.06]I kept reading on the Reddit that it's like a rip off of magical survivors.
[90:04.20]So on the plane trip out, he was like, I'm going to like download magical survivors and like see what the one it was based on and support the original.
[90:11.60]It's just not on iOS.
[90:13.46]Not a big one.
[90:14.22]Is it actually?
[90:15.46]It's like Android only.
[90:17.66]You can find some interesting stuff on there.
[90:20.40]I wonder why that one didn't take off.
[90:23.54]Now is not the best time for this, Aiden.
[90:25.64]Head for the tunnels.
[90:27.23]Alright, tunnels.
[90:28.79]Dude, the tunnel troll.
[90:30.97]Here we go.
[90:36.20]Oh wait, we're tunnel trolling?
[90:37.80]Get to the station through the metros.
[90:40.94]Wait.
[90:41.14]Is there like... Hold on.
[90:46.58]Make sure that we can... I don't want to just leave here without something we can do or crafts of items.
[90:55.90]well that's the objective okay so I'm just making sure wait which one is the objective oh down down here 20 meters down alright it's nighttime by the way so this is where it gets a little hairy
[91:25.90]Where did you get this two-hander?
[91:27.66]It was in the military truck.
[91:29.10]I got the good loot.
[91:29.88]Oh, what?
[91:33.46]We have to pick this lock.
[91:38.98]Yeah, so clear the Zeds, dude.
[91:41.26]You're the one with the big two-hander.
[91:43.00]I'm hitting them!
[91:48.98]That was actually pretty cool.
[91:51.12]Why did I just do the thing from God of War?
[91:53.72]I threw, uh...
[91:58.26]I just recalled Mjolnir.
[92:01.16]Hey, you're the lockpick guy.
[92:02.08]Let's go.
[92:02.60]That's me.
[92:04.87]Zeds are coming.
[92:05.53]Something exploded.
[92:06.21]Don't know why.
[92:10.81]That's me.
[92:13.20]First try, Andy.
[92:14.58]Bandits.
[92:23.47]I think we should... Can we just leave?
[92:25.69]I want these guys dead.
[92:27.35]Forever even considering fighting.
[92:31.35]We had Siggy's move.
[92:34.49]Alright, let's go.
[92:35.05]Before we get killed.
[92:37.29]Killed.
[92:38.87]Oh my god.
[92:39.93]I grabbed... How do... Help!
[92:44.23]I don't know how to do it.
[92:45.39]I'm honest.
[92:48.94]Running out of stamina works.
[92:53.01]Oh shit!
[92:53.75]Okay, I grabbed it.
[92:54.29]I'm fine.
[93:07.12]Alright.
[93:10.32]Ooh, pills.
[93:12.48]Aspirin.
[93:13.46]Pills here.
[93:15.00]Cigarettes.
[93:17.64]Hey, where are the rifles?
[93:19.40]Where are the shotguns?
[93:21.41]My chat's telling me there are no guns in the future.
[93:23.98]There are no guns in the game?
[93:26.94]Good.
[93:27.68]They said there's like two.
[93:28.82]Make these gamers have to fucking actually play the game.
[93:31.16]They kind of spoiled it.
[93:32.46]You know, I would have talked about it for like six more hours, but... Oh, we want guns.
[93:36.12]Now the gamers actually have to fucking play the game and not just like shoot stuff.
[93:40.16]Yeah.
[93:44.52]Oh, good.
[93:53.12]Oh, shit.
[93:54.54]Gary?
[93:55.42]It was a fucking cockroach.
[93:57.65]This is not how you would crawl through this.
[94:01.25]You are deliberately putting your ass in my face.
[94:04.05]Deliberately.
[94:05.29]I'm a spider.
[94:06.89]Let me go in front of you just so you can see.
[94:08.31]This is not how somebody crawls through a vent.
[94:10.65]I've been waiting years for you to say that.
[94:12.62]Look at this.
[94:19.45]Okay.
[94:19.91]You wouldn't even fit doing that.
[94:20.97]Wait, watch out.
[94:21.73]Watch out, Zeds.
[94:23.37]You get the one on the left.
[94:24.45]Alright, you have to give one community sub every time you say that from now on.
[94:28.11]Say what?
[94:29.35]Oh, Zeds, look out.
[94:31.04]Oh, shit.
[94:31.74]I owe 100 community subs to my chat.
[94:33.06]I hope I can do it.
[94:35.28]You didn't do the one on the left.
[94:39.48]My credit card got declined like five times last time.
[94:42.50]I hope I can do it this time.
[94:47.75]Okay, I need a weapon.
[94:48.87]Do you have any extras?
[94:50.93]I do.
[94:51.21]I don't know if I can drop them.
[94:53.68]Oh, I can.
[94:54.70]Oh, I gotta take shrooms.
[94:56.50]I dropped a slicer for you.
[95:01.80]That didn't do anything.
[95:02.70]My immunity is still low.
[95:06.34]It adds like a minute.
[95:07.52]It doesn't add like a full timer.
[95:09.64]Okay, let's go.
[95:10.09]We gotta hurry then.
[95:10.61]It only adds like 30 seconds?
[95:17.79]Okay, we gotta speedrun this.
[95:19.79]Zeds are coming.
[95:21.31]That's one.
[95:30.18]You really are playing chivalry at this point now.
[95:34.85]What?
[95:35.07]It looks like you're play fighting.
[95:36.49]Like you don't actually want to swing that at them.
[95:38.39]You just watching?
[95:39.25]Did I give you my weapon so you can watch?
[95:46.81]Alright, take some more mushrooms.
[95:48.15]We actually do have to go.
[95:48.91]You're right.
[95:49.27]Run.
[95:50.21]There's mushrooms right here.
[95:50.93]Oh, sick.
[95:52.19]Watch out.
[95:53.13]Watch out.
[95:53.47]Infected.
[95:57.25]Don't alert them.
[95:57.79]You can just crawl through.
[96:02.46]Can you do the tutorial, man?
[96:04.12]Oh, watch out.
[96:07.98]Waiter.
[96:08.28]Oh, sick.
[96:08.82]Sick.
[96:13.89]What if I happen to don't alert the Zeds?
[96:15.93]They were going to see me.
[96:17.21]It was fate.
[96:20.43]Oh, you said it.
[96:20.99]Now you owe me 100 gifts for the community.
[96:23.53]Alright, this is a lockpick door.
[96:28.01]Okay, you're a lockpick guy.
[96:29.93]Can you please do it?
[96:30.63]I got you.
[96:31.03]If you're actually going to protect me, I will.
[96:33.45]I'm... We're in.
[96:41.39]Okay, shut the door.
[96:44.59]There's a container in here somewhere.
[96:47.29]They just punched me through the door.
[96:48.53]48 meters somewhere.
[97:00.15]That's definitely in here somewhere.
[97:05.26]Cool.
[97:08.58]Our immunity is getting even lower.
[97:18.92]We're close, though.
[97:19.58]It's fine.
[97:20.70]What was the... Okay, that's like a dog tunnel at one of those dog shows.
[97:24.80]What's the point of this?
[97:26.76]You just went through the obstacle.
[97:27.98]It's an air duct.
[97:29.26]It's an air duct for the air to travel through this, you see?
[97:31.54]Yeah, but why did you... What's the point of having it here?
[97:34.90]The air is not going to circulate unless you make this tube. 48.
[97:46.70]Alright, get to the metro station.
[97:49.70]We lost it.
[97:50.22]We lost the scent.
[97:50.82]I don't know what we're doing here.
[97:55.86]We had a beep beep and we lost the scent.
[97:58.37]Oh, there was a beep beep back there?
[97:59.61]It was.
[98:00.71]You want to go back?
[98:01.59]We only have two minutes.
[98:02.45]It's too late.
[98:03.73]There's a whole bunch of shrooms down here.
[98:05.23]Like every ten steps there's a shroom.
[98:06.99]You want to go back?
[98:08.38]No, I want to do the main quest objective.
[98:11.16]Okay, fine.
[98:11.92]I don't want to get distracted.
[98:24.51]That's the sound I make when I swing my two-hander.
[98:28.46]When I play chivalry.
[98:34.30]There are shrooms everywhere, you're right.
[98:35.78]Alright, let's hide from this guy.
[98:40.77]Does he know?
[98:45.37]What?
[98:45.69]How does he know?
[98:46.33]Oh, your head was sticking out.
[98:54.43]I blasted him.
[98:57.01]We got to... Okay, just run forward.
[99:04.18]Oh, he had vodka.
[99:05.56]And decoys.
[99:07.12]Decoys.
[99:07.54]Decoys on that guy.
[99:08.60]Let's go.
[99:10.40]And cigarettes.
[99:11.62]And... Yep.
[99:14.50]I got to the flare.
[99:15.75]Look around.
[99:26.97]Ooh, there's the immunity.
[99:28.45]Just drink it.
[99:31.11]You put a mask on?
[99:31.79]I think I'm standing in the light.
[99:35.24]No, you put a mask on your character.
[99:38.50]I did?
[99:39.78]Yeah.
[99:39.90]Oh, cool.
[99:42.61]That's really cool.
[99:43.29]Yeah, I really like that.
[99:46.45]Here, you're the door guy.
[99:48.43]I mean, I'm the walk pit guy, not the door guy.
[99:51.15]Can you hold the door for me?
[99:52.75]Oh, shit.
[99:53.61]Watch out.
[99:53.95]We got a spitter.
[99:55.41]Oh, there's a guy spitting fucking snot out of his nose.
[99:58.64]Oh, it's coming out of his chest.
[100:07.72]Oh, shit.
[100:08.22]What do I do?
[100:11.13]Okay, skip, skip, skip, run forward and hit it with a hammer.
[100:14.59]Okay.
[100:16.35]Well, he... Oh, it's a medium lockpick.
[100:19.81]I got it.
[100:24.59]Hakan.
[100:25.97]I'm telling you, I'm going to first try every single one of these.
[100:28.71]It's open.
[100:30.99]Okay, we're good.
[100:31.56]Did you kill that guy?
[100:34.74]Yeah.
[100:36.36]Killing him took less time than the phone call.
[100:41.17]Did he have anything on him?
[100:42.31]Trophy?
[100:43.05]He had a special zombie-infected trophy.
[100:45.15]He was like, congratulations on killing one of my rare species.
[100:48.45]Here is an award.
[100:49.61]No power.
[100:57.07]Watch out!
[100:57.47]Yeah, you're going to want to stay behind me for this.
[101:08.29]You're doing like a, I'm like a gremlin routine.
[101:10.85]That's like the, I'm gonna go down and I'm gonna act like a gremlin.
[101:15.05]To make people laugh at the party.
[101:16.95]How often do you play gremlin?
[101:22.42]I don't know.
[101:23.74]Have I ever seen somebody do the thing that I just referenced?
[101:28.88]I don't think so.
[101:32.54]I don't think I've seen that.
[101:33.90]I don't think gremlin is a game a lot of kids play.
[101:38.87]Why am I imagining a fake scenario where like somebody's drunk at a party and they go on all fours and are like, I'm the gremlin and like are running around?
[101:47.02]Yeah.
[101:47.86]I feel like that's probably happened.
[101:48.92]I mean, anything that can happen has happened.
[101:59.97]And then they like jump into the pool.
[102:01.87]You know what I mean?
[102:02.35]Like, it's me, gremlin guy.
[102:04.61]And then they jump in the pool.
[102:06.96]I think you're thinking of your Sims playthrough again.
[102:13.22]I'm on the platform.
[102:15.24]Oh, we're getting some golden coins.
[102:23.08]So are these kind of like Hitman?
[102:23.98]You just throw them to distract people?
[102:26.45]I guess.
[102:30.94]Are you sure this isn't something you did yourself?
[102:33.36]Hitman VR.
[102:34.34]Should I play?
[102:35.29]No.
[102:36.67]Really?
[102:37.01]I thought you would have been like, oh, God, yes.
[102:39.49]It's okay.
[102:40.71]Let me explain Hitman VR to you.
[102:43.23]So, IO Interactive.
[102:45.05]Phenomenal company.
[102:46.63]Like, seriously.
[102:47.11]Like, what a great... What a story, right?
[102:50.55]Oh, the IOverse?
[102:51.75]They bought back their rights to their game.
[102:53.53]They made fucking incredible Hitman games.
[102:55.49]One, two, and three.
[102:56.27]Absolute, like, masterpieces of games.
[102:57.77]It was so much fun.
[102:59.49]They decided to make a PSVR version of Hitman.
[103:03.52]Oh, it was only PSVR?
[103:04.52]It was PSVR exclusive.
[103:06.86]And what they did is, like, a year later...
[103:10.67]Because you had to play with the controller in your hand with the VR headset on.
[103:15.34]A year later, they decided to port the PSVR version to like all the other headsets.
[103:22.00]And it's really weird how it controls.
[103:24.78]We just got Westworlded.
[103:28.87]Okay, imagine they took the controller, they cut the controller in half, and you hold the PS4 controller in two hands.
[103:35.85]It's kind of, it's weird.
[103:38.37]Is it worth doing?
[103:40.21]I think it's fun, and it's hilarious, this shit you can do.
[103:42.63]Okay, here's the choice.
[103:43.57]I still haven't played Half-Life Alyx.
[103:45.29]Do I play it?
[103:45.99]What are you doing?
[103:47.05]Do not even make that, that's, you want me to make the choice for you?
[103:52.58]Yeah, or Wii Sports.
[103:54.98]You've never played Wii Sports?
[103:56.76]Never played Wii Sports.
[103:57.78]So, like, it's either Half-Life Alyx, Wii Sports, or Hitman VR.
[104:01.18]Oh, fuck.
[104:01.58]The Super Bowl is today.
[104:03.31]It is.
[104:04.05]Oh.
[104:04.91]Are you going to watch?
[104:05.99]No.
[104:07.27]I'm hoping the Packers win.
[104:08.93]Half-Life Alyx, Wii Sports, or Hitman VR?
[104:11.33]I'd say Wii Sports because that's a legendary classic video game.
[104:15.14]Okay, I don't have a Wii.
[104:17.20]We'll then play Half-Life Alyx.
[104:20.94]I feel like I've been hyping Alex up to you for like a year straight now and you're gonna play it and be like, that sucked.
[104:27.47]Someone was hyping it to me not that like a week ago as well.
[104:40.14]I can't even click.
[104:41.24]You're doing it too fast.
[104:47.89]You shouldn't trust me.
[104:49.21]I'm untrustworthy.
[104:49.89]I can try.
[104:50.93]There are people here that are probably wanting to watch this, but like even get even a sniff of what the story is.
[104:57.68]And we have to both apologize.
[104:59.36]I can recap it.
[105:00.30]I don't have to apologize.
[105:01.88]If you apologize to your chat, you give them power.
[105:07.34]They feed off of that.
[105:09.24]But anyways, play Half-Life, Alex.
[105:12.08]There's a couple of sequences in Half-Life Alyx that were just like, wow, this is what VR is supposed to be.
[105:16.15]Okay, wait, are we just leaving here?
[105:22.59]I think so.
[105:23.07]That was it?
[105:23.93]Okay.
[105:25.77]Oh, it's the enforcers.
[105:27.53]Oh, shit.
[105:28.38]Speaking of Half-Life Alyx.
[105:30.54]What?
[105:31.08]This is Half-Life 2 opening scene right now.
[105:34.60]Wait, you forgot to go.
[105:35.56]I can't.
[105:37.48]I can't.
[105:39.47]But can't we all agree that Red Faction 1 is better than Half-Life?
[105:44.98]Okay, I don't think you're going to be allowed to be on the internet anymore after saying that.
[105:49.46]I want to make it really clear.
[105:51.10]I have nothing to do with this person.
[105:53.67]I don't really know them that well.
[105:55.21]I have friends that I kind of... I don't really know them that well, though.
[105:58.71]Have you played Red Faction?
[106:00.93]Yes.
[106:03.49]Okay.
[106:04.67]Well, you're going to tell me Red Faction is not a good game?
[106:07.35]I mean, I don't remember playing it.
[106:09.37]It was a long time ago.
[106:11.03]Okay, well, do it again.
[106:13.41]Play Red Faction again.
[106:14.59]Better than Half-Life 1 or Half-Life 2?
[106:17.98]Better than Half-Life 2.
[106:20.02]Because it's basically Half-Life 1 made two years later.
[106:24.73]Oh, well, everybody can have opinions and, you know, we can respect your opinion, but disagree with you.
[106:30.70]I don't I don't think anyone's respecting my opinion.
[106:33.44]We can disagree with that opinion.
[106:34.74]We all have opinions.
[106:35.64]We can, you know, just settle down.
[106:37.26]Driving so much chat engagement.
[106:41.96]OK, we can either leave or explore.
[106:43.14]Yeah, I want to.
[106:45.82]We got janitors like, oh, we're in the metro.
[106:48.10]Wait, are we in the metro?
[106:52.01]Are we in the metro?
[106:54.14]I don't think there's much we can do here.
[107:00.83]There's a door over there, and then there's a door that has a quest marker on it over there.
[107:04.81]Yeah, okay.
[107:05.35]Let's go to the quest marker.
[107:06.57]We're going to distract it.
[107:07.97]I'm walking.
[107:15.38]I will say that when I got to the boat section of Half-Life 2, I almost threw up every time I tried to play it.
[107:19.70]Okay, but did you ever throw up during playing Red Faction?
[107:22.14]Nope.
[107:26.72]But I also have to be fair to the game as well.
[107:30.13]That's back before anyone knew what FOV even was.
[107:33.53]Back in 2006, 2007, FOV, people didn't even fucking care.
[107:39.63]Nobody even knew what it was.
[107:42.41]That was a gamer enthusiast.
[107:44.38]Only a few people really even knew or cared about that.
[107:46.26]You're kind of reminded of the olden days where every single video TotalBiscuit had to explain what FPS was.
[107:53.23]No, yeah, like, I mean, it was not, like, common knowledge back in, like, 2005, 2006.
[107:58.41]Like, FOV was something that nobody really even thought, really thought that much about.
[108:03.54]Yeah, and the human eye can only see, like, 20, so.
[108:06.06]Alright, where are we going?
[108:08.85]Yeah, so there's that slider in the video menu that starts at 75 and goes up to 90, right?
[108:14.98]I never touched it.
[108:15.76]So during the boat missions, it was 75 FOV and I'm sitting like a foot away, two feet away from my screen.
[108:21.34]And I'm just like, why the fuck?
[108:22.68]I'm sick.
[108:24.06]Oh, I remember having to lie down on my back on the floor.
[108:27.34]I was in the middle of the boat mission.
[108:29.11]And I seriously had to get up, hit escape, lie down on my back, and lie there for like a minute or two.
[108:35.30]But I really wanted to experience the game so that I got up eventually after I was not nauseous and did it again for like another five minutes.
[108:41.54]Felt like I was going to puke again, lied on my back on the ground.
[108:44.86]I had to do that for like 40 minutes to get through that boat section.
[108:47.18]Okay, but how do you feel about the hour-long non-skippable in-character cutscene?
[108:53.99]That's like, alright.
[108:55.53]But they like pioneered that shit.
[108:58.46]They pioneered you having to, like, stand still?
[109:01.12]You have to understand something, Ster.
[109:03.26]Weren't you saying earlier that you like games that let you go fast?
[109:05.68]Yeah, but listen- You were saying, like, I'm, like, going fast!
[109:08.10]Back before, before that, it used to be you had, like, eight Final Fantasy CDs because there were fucking four CDs full of FMV full-motion video rendered cutscenes on them.
[109:20.33]Like, when they came up with that idea to not have, like, rendered cutscenes-
[109:26.33]That was a huge deal.
[109:27.71]Having it in the game, it wasn't just like a cutscene that you had to watch.
[109:31.63]But I think just because you can doesn't mean you should.
[109:33.73]I'm stuck on this.
[109:36.21]Sell all your valuables.
[109:37.47]I actually think I'm going to sell some stuff.
[109:40.95]Yeah, the like cutscene that is not, you know, there's no loading screen.
[109:45.01]Go to the cutscene.
[109:45.75]Wait, there's classes in this game?
[109:47.95]These weapons actually look pretty good.
[109:50.29]This guy's selling joggers for a brawler class.
[109:54.32]I think I want this axe.
[110:02.52]Is that a bad idea?
[110:05.13]I just sold everything.
[110:08.45]I think selling all the valuables are all like things that don't matter.
[110:11.67]Okay, I hope so.
[110:15.77]Holy shit, there's grenades.
[110:20.22]Ooh.
[110:23.38]Stamina cost?
[110:24.88]Bracers for a tank.
[110:28.28]When do I get the wingsuit?
[110:33.85]I'm pretty sure there is one.
[110:36.05]They might be, yeah.
[110:37.57]Alright, we should probably get... I don't know.
[110:40.23]They have the grappling hook again.
[110:41.67]Now, can't you upgrade and craft your gear?
[110:45.45]I think so, right?
[110:47.45]I'm going to buy a few of these.
[110:49.35]Yeah, I'm buying a grenade.
[110:53.69]Yeah, buy a couple grenades.
[110:55.19]I think we can utilize them pretty well.
[110:58.36]We got the craft master over here.
[111:02.27]Oh, you get blueprints.
[111:03.15]There's mines and shock arrows for my arrow.
[111:06.64]Where do you see blueprints?
[111:10.86]The other merchant over here.
[111:11.78]That was truly a pleasure.
[111:14.44]Reinforces your weapon.
[111:16.68]Is your voice higher today?
[111:17.74]You sound like a balloon.
[111:18.82]What are you talking about?
[111:19.66]I sound like a balloon?
[111:23.66]What do you mean a balloon?
[111:24.82]Your voice is a little higher.
[111:27.82]Your voice is a little bit higher.
[111:29.89]What's...
[111:31.69]I mean, hold on.
[111:33.13]I don't have my effects thing on, do I?
[111:38.67]Yeah, you've actually like the whole time you've been talking.
[111:41.29]You've actually been talking like this.
[111:45.13]It's been really weird.
[111:45.95]I didn't want I thought you were doing like a new thing.
[111:47.73]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[111:49.81]How do I sound?
[111:52.22]Oh, should we both just do this and see what people say?
[111:56.06]Just continue to stream the whole time.
[111:57.50]A little bit higher.
[112:00.07]And every hour that goes by, we get a little bit higher.
[112:02.42]A little bit higher.
[112:03.36]And then when we get too high, we end the stream.
[112:06.78]Okay.
[112:11.16]We have to have a base level, though.
[112:12.50]That's just high enough.
[112:15.42]That's like one notch over.
[112:17.28]Okay, so how do I sound with one notch over?
[112:20.02]Is it kind of weird, but you can't really tell?
[112:22.76]Are you doing it now?
[112:23.44]I'm doing it right now.
[112:25.00]I can't tell at all.
[112:26.12]I think I got used to it.
[112:27.24]Hold on.
[112:28.02]What about this one?
[112:30.03]I can't tell.
[112:30.77]What about now?
[112:32.14]Is it different?
[112:34.10]Very slightly.
[112:35.18]I think I heard there.
[112:36.20]Okay.
[112:36.52]So how about now?
[112:39.22]Is it too noticeable now?
[112:40.94]Extremely noticeable.
[112:41.88]Alright.
[112:42.74]How about now?
[112:45.38]Is it, how does it sound?
[112:46.42]Is it like, okay.
[112:47.58]That sounds like something might be wrong with your mic, but like kind of normal.
[112:51.12]Alright.
[112:51.66]You do now you do one notch on pitch.
[112:53.30]We both have the same product.
[112:55.74]Are you doing gender or pitch?
[112:57.13]I did pitch.
[113:00.17]OK, this is that's one notch gender.
[113:03.30]OK, I don't hear anything.
[113:05.35]Two.
[113:06.41]Oh, you can start to hear it.
[113:07.85]It sounds like something wrong with your mic.
[113:09.86]yeah and then you go a little yeah this one okay this one I have to go pretty far and then it's weird is that picture which one I'm doing pitch now this is one notch okay yeah this is just one notch and I can kind of hear it yeah okay I'm on one notch as well alright let's go okay this is so weird it is really weird once we get to a certain point though then we're gonna you know we gotta go okay I I'm gonna upgrade
[113:39.95]My consumable?
[113:41.73]Yeah, you can get like shock tips for your weapon here.
[113:44.47]You can get, you know, we can get some crafts for our... You gotta buy those so you can upgrade your weapon.
[113:49.70]It's like a different person.
[113:50.68]Yeah.
[113:50.94]Alright, I think I got what I need.
[113:56.10]I'm gonna buy a couple... Hold on, what's this?
[114:00.55]I have a lot of heals.
[114:01.71]I got eight heals.
[114:02.45]I think we're good.
[114:05.73]I'm right.
[114:07.00]You went up higher.
[114:08.48]I didn't go up higher.
[114:09.26]Yes, you did.
[114:09.94]You went up higher.
[114:11.22]I just started talking a little bit.
[114:12.58]No, you went up higher.
[114:13.70]You went like this.
[114:14.24]I didn't go up higher.
[114:14.98]This is what you just did.
[114:17.08]What are you talking about?
[114:17.72]You just went higher.
[114:19.28]I was just talking different.
[114:21.38]I didn't change the slider.
[114:23.24]Yes, you just did.
[114:23.87]I heard it.
[114:25.31]What do you mean you heard it?
[114:26.45]Do errand.
[114:27.59]Errand.
[114:29.71]Errand.
[114:30.71]What are you talking about?
[114:32.37]Can I get an errand from you?
[114:40.60]Alright, let's fucking play the game, please No, that's that's like chipmunk, you know, it's not it's yeah, it's like not like

[115:36.28]Okay, we're caught up.
[115:38.36]Completely unwatchable stream.
[115:43.98]Come fuck up.
[115:45.72]Fuck you, dude.
[115:46.44]Alright, find the brass knuckle thief.
[115:48.60]Find Hubert Krabatsos.
[115:53.78]Let's find him.
[115:55.98]Oh, you went the wrong way.
[115:57.95]Pretty sure Hubert...
[116:02.45]I'm sorry that I said you sound like a balloon and made you lose a thousand viewers.
[116:06.74]Well, time that person off for five minutes.
[116:10.56]That'll do it.
[116:11.04]How dare you do that to our stream?
[116:14.28]I take my stream very seriously.
[116:18.71]I still haven't figured this out.
[116:20.11]I still haven't figured out how to climb.
[116:21.47]Oh, this guy's got a book.
[116:24.20]I still for some reason have not figured this out what like how to like properly like climb without losing all your stamina oh you just climb up I think the more you press like if you mash spacebar it's just like oh it's just okay it sucks it out of you yeah what is this book going on here I don't know I was by the campfire is this Life is Strange
[116:52.17]I know you're cycling through your secondaries to see if you have a grenade.
[116:56.09]I'm not.
[116:56.45]I'm sitting down.
[116:57.05]I can't do anything.
[116:57.77]That's what I was doing.
[116:59.31]Oh, no.
[116:59.49]I'm sitting down and just taking in the environment.
[117:03.72]That do anything?
[117:04.60]No, there's like right here.
[117:05.72]There's actually like a sit spot.
[117:08.10]Oh, no.
[117:08.40]I see what's going on.
[117:09.82]All these guys got to the boat level in Half-Life 2.
[117:12.34]I see.
[117:12.72]I get it.
[117:14.06]I mean, I have a grenade.
[117:20.49]Yeah.
[117:20.87]Life is Strange.
[117:21.53]Let's go.
[117:24.84]Just kind of chill and vibe out.
[117:27.26]So tough being a teen.
[117:29.48]Alright.
[117:29.94]Are you ready?
[117:33.12]Yeah.
[117:34.85]Is it?
[117:35.43]Okay.
[117:36.07]He almost.
[117:36.71]Okay.
[117:37.05]I thought he was going to throw a grenade.
[117:38.35]I thought he was going to throw a grenade at them.
[117:42.11]Alright.
[117:44.19]Come on.
[117:44.39]Let's go.
[117:45.25]Stop.
[117:45.59]I didn't even see it.
[117:46.89]I didn't even look.
[117:47.71]I didn't.
[117:48.25]I thought that.
[117:48.85]Okay.
[117:49.17]I didn't even look.
[117:51.89]I didn't even get it on camera.
[117:56.41]Okay.
[118:00.01]No, nothing.
[118:02.57]Scraps.
[118:03.21]I killed her for a box of scraps.
[118:06.32]Oh, scraps?
[118:08.46]Unlock faction structures and activate a safe zone.
[118:13.04]Yeah, I have no more grenades.
[118:16.90]Okay.
[118:22.39]Let's just go do this.
[118:23.65]Wait, there's something going on here.
[118:26.41]Bandit.
[118:28.14]Oh, is there a bandit?
[118:28.74]Bandit.
[118:30.70]That's not... Okay, they need to fix that.
[118:32.60]That doesn't make any sense.
[118:33.78]I'm sending an air support.
[118:35.38]That doesn't make any sense.
[118:36.42]Like, how would that even make any sense?
[118:38.24]I can't even climb that.
[118:41.52]I just heard an explosion.
[118:44.44]He's gonna get away.
[118:45.34]Wait, there was... Oh, that's what you meant by bandit.
[118:50.33]Band-aid.
[118:50.83]Bandit.
[118:52.33]Oh.
[118:53.27]Can we go to the quest?
[118:55.06]I want to earn like a new parkour skill.
[118:59.04]Fine.
[119:01.56]It's up here.
[119:02.08]It's like straight up.
[119:03.68]Oh my god, it is.
[119:11.67]How did you get on top of that?
[119:12.65]I climbed it.
[119:16.71]With my arms.
[119:20.03]Explain how microwaves work to Jerma.
[119:23.79]Literally, who knows how they work?
[119:25.29]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[119:27.19]I have a question for you.
[119:28.29]Don't listen to any of these jokers.
[119:30.51]Any of these idiots.
[119:32.77]Listen to me.
[119:33.97]These morons, okay?
[119:35.33]I have to make it very clear.
[119:36.41]We gotta get a baseline here.
[119:38.51]So, when you microwave food, I don't own a microwave.
[119:42.84]You don't own a microwave.
[119:44.96]I don't.
[119:46.28]Why do you not own a microwave?
[119:48.45]Because Gordon Ramsay would be really disappointed in me if I did.
[119:51.69]When you can put something in the oven, why not put it in the oven?
[119:56.63]It takes like two hours.
[119:57.95]It takes like an hour.
[120:00.58]How do we climb?
[120:01.06]What the fuck is going on?
[120:03.74]The Sonic and the Hedgehog show is going on right now.
[120:07.08]Okay.
[120:07.36]Well, anyways, you've used a microphone.
[120:13.65]Yeah, I've used my microphone a little bit.
[120:15.53]So when you use your microwave oven,
[120:19.49]when you do that yeah I do that yes when you okay you put it in let's say you put in like popcorn or whatever oh it's behind it's behind you okay let's just theoretically say that I'm making my own popcorn in my microwave that I own sure you put it and it goes for like a minute yeah and you hear right when it gets to zero
[120:43.89]and you open it, does that, like, would you put, like, putting your hand in there, like, right when it hits zero, don't you, isn't that, like, kind of weird?
[120:51.89]Like, that, isn't that, like, an odd thing?
[120:54.97]That, like, there was just radiation in there.
[120:57.28]Zero, open, oh, there's my popcorn.
[120:59.36]Like, isn't that kind of weird?
[121:01.20]I've never thought about it, but, you know what, that is kind of weird.
[121:04.68]Like, really think about that for just a second.
[121:08.06]Like, the fact that, like, there may be, like, residual waves in there.
[121:11.88]Does it just go away?
[121:12.52]Wait.
[121:14.64]I mean, I'm pretty sure if the microwave was on, your hand could be in it for like a second before like you would even.
[121:22.87]Microwaves are not radiation.
[121:24.17]Yeah, but it's like, it's like radio waves.
[121:27.57]Got it.
[121:28.23]No one will be here.
[121:30.09]Maybe in an hour.
[121:31.66]That's not how it works.
[121:32.96]Kids these days, they just grow up trusting technology because they didn't live through that, like all the shit that we did.
[121:39.78]I'm just telling you.
[121:40.36]The radio with the announcement of the aliens.
[121:42.96]What was that?
[121:43.36]The War of the Worlds?
[121:45.38]they like they didn't have that they just trust stuff and we know to like to filter through and find what's real when we hear the news because most news these days is fake honestly okay is it weird that there's a concept of the is the microwave a weird appliance the fridge is like a fridge it is cold in here
[122:08.33]An oven heats up with gas and heat, right?
[122:13.01]A microwave like zaps with fucking micro radio waves your food until it's like nuclear.
[122:20.34]It's kind of weird.
[122:21.18]It's kind of a weird appliance.
[122:24.36]That's why I don't own one and you were judging me for not having one.
[122:29.78]We gotta go all the way to the top and then you're gonna jump off and I'm gonna laugh at it.
[122:33.30]Okay.
[122:34.89]That's the end of the conversation.
[122:36.71]Wait, who's running away?
[122:38.19]There's like a... What is... We have one minute and 15 seconds to go this way.
[122:42.72]Oh, shit.
[122:42.90]Where did you go?
[122:43.40]We're going up.
[122:43.84]What happened?
[123:05.47]There was a timer in front of me!
[123:07.39]It said 1 minute 15 on a marker all the way across the map!
[123:12.55]Oh, there is?
[123:13.25]What?
[123:13.61]Wait, what?
[123:14.25]I'm not crazy, right?
[123:15.69]Am I crazy?
[123:16.61]There's a red circle pointing me up here.
[123:20.21]All players require- What?
[123:22.03]Oh, you gotta come help me.
[123:25.87]How do you think your Wi-Fi router works?
[123:27.71]I don't know, that's fucking weird too!
[123:31.67]You know, that's weird.
[123:33.07]We can communicate like with nothing and no wires.
[123:36.23]Dude just fell off.
[123:37.41]What are you doing?
[123:39.15]Where am I?
[123:40.23]Why am I on the top of a construction site?
[123:44.64]What happened?
[123:47.16]I fast traveled you.
[123:50.52]I didn't realize I got 10 seconds to... Okay, anyways.
[123:59.33]Yeah, we failed this.
[124:01.09]Anyways, we gotta pull back a little.
[124:05.02]I'm not saying that there's something wrong with, like, radio waves.
[124:09.68]I'm not saying that, like, your phone and wireless signals are weird.
[124:13.34]I'm just saying it's kind of odd, like, that we have this technology where we can be able to do stuff without wires and cords and stuff.
[124:20.63]Okay, we gotta go.
[124:22.87]Alright, so how do we get down here safely?
[124:26.55]So what you're saying is you also, similar to me, man of culture, do not trust 5G.
[124:34.13]No, I don't care.
[124:35.10]Look, you want to have this conversation?
[124:38.36]Here we go.
[124:41.76]When is it going to be enough?
[124:46.80]When is it going to be enough for you to sit on the toilet and go on Twitter?
[124:50.32]How many Gs do we need?
[124:51.00]When is it going to be enough?
[124:53.45]Are you saying like we already have enough Gs?
[124:56.03]Do we need like 8G?
[124:59.83]I mean, has your phone ever disconnected before and you were like, I don't think I can go on living.
[125:10.22]10G.
[125:13.10]What is a G?
[125:14.92]It's a gigabit band of wireless information.
[125:18.95]Just said a few words that I thought sounded good.
[125:20.49]It sounded good.
[125:26.50]Am I there?
[125:27.88]He's not here.
[125:28.36]Why do we still have 14 seconds?
[125:30.80]He's climbing up this?
[125:31.72]Did we fail the mission?
[125:33.14]No, I got here, but you climbed up this.
[125:35.94]We got to climb this.
[125:38.04]Hey, man.
[125:57.63]Yeah, we gotta climb up this.
[125:59.37]How are we supposed to do that?
[126:08.27]Fucking grab something!
[126:12.58]You're like, oh my, okay.
[126:15.36]I thought you were gonna fall too.
[126:18.00]That looks so funny.
[126:21.10]Nice, good job.
[126:24.82]Okay, we gotta climb.
[126:27.07]I'm not like anti-5G.
[126:29.55]I'm just saying it's crazy that we have this technology.
[126:32.09]Who gave the aliens gave it to us?
[126:33.75]Alright, I'm going to fall off.
[126:34.87]You want to hear what I really think?
[126:37.11]I do.
[126:41.17]Okay.
[126:43.60]Wow, they silenced you that quick?
[126:45.24]Like in real time.
[126:53.63]I was going to hold that longer, but I feel like that would hurt.
[126:55.27]It was really loud.
[126:56.53]Was it loud?
[126:57.67]It was, yeah.
[126:58.43]Oh, my God.
[126:59.01]It wasn't supposed to be.
[127:01.29]Well, you know, I'm dying now.
[127:05.64]Is this guy's name Tuber?
[127:08.32]It's Hubert.
[127:09.72]Oh, I just heard, hey, Tuber.
[127:18.88]That's a restricted area.
[127:20.78]Okay.
[127:22.89]Uh, yeah, watch out.
[127:24.25]See if he has heads.
[127:25.21]Will you get a glue onto something?
[127:28.39]Oh, it's this way.
[127:37.61]Wait, where?
[127:38.17]When do you get close?
[127:40.57]I think it's this way.
[127:41.35]Just find him, right?
[127:42.83]There's a door here?
[127:43.97]He's right here.
[127:45.29]You fucking... Is this you?
[127:47.24]Leave me alone.
[127:48.46]Is this you, Tuber?
[127:49.56]Is this Tuber?
[127:50.04]What are you doing, Tuber?
[127:54.19]I don't know anyway.
[127:57.93]Why'd you run away then?
[127:59.01]Visible light has a higher frequency than microwaves.
[128:02.91]I know.
[128:03.53]Look, I don't have a problem with microwave ovens.
[128:05.39]I'm just saying they kind of scare me a little.
[128:07.35]You know what scares me and people always make fun of me for?
[128:10.54]What?
[128:11.92]Magnets.
[128:14.06]I'm terrified of putting a magnet anywhere near my computer, so I don't want any magnets.
[128:20.64]No.
[128:21.34]Okay.
[128:22.37]They have, like, metal cases for your computer and it's like, oh, you can put, like, there's, like, magnet for your Corsair, like, magnet on your computer.
[128:28.13]I'm like, is it... You ever put a magnet to a TV?
[128:31.71]Like, what happened with that?
[128:33.30]Yeah, everyone's saying fair, fair.
[128:35.26]You're afraid of magnets.
[128:38.02]And I, like, don't like... Microwaves kind of freak me out, but, like, you're afraid of magnets.
[128:42.26]But people are saying true.
[128:44.26]Fair, fair, that's true, true, true.
[128:46.81]I don't, like, because, okay, we were at PAX East once, and this guy was like, hey, promoting my game.
[128:50.37]I think it was, like, Starbound or something like that.
[128:51.89]And he was like, here, we got, like, magnets for it.
[128:53.37]And I was like, dude, I don't want your fucking gamer magnet.
[128:55.97]I want that anywhere near my computer.
[128:57.09]And he was, like, really weirded out.
[129:01.60]I don't want that near my computer.
[129:04.02]Yeah.
[129:04.50]I can't believe you're getting true.
[129:05.88]Okay.
[129:08.22]This is, you're getting true, true.
[129:09.92]Oh, yeah, true.
[129:10.50]Well, like, I'm not afraid my computer is accidentally going to go in a microwave.
[129:18.45]I think they're both valid opinions to have.
[129:21.45]Even though, okay, you're not afraid of magnets.
[129:24.04]You just don't want them near your computer.
[129:25.94]Or my head.
[129:28.82]Yes, or your head.
[129:29.84]They mess with your brain waves.
[129:31.28]If you were to take a magnet and put it next to your head, would you do that?
[129:40.06]I have to figure out what your level of fear is.
[129:42.72]You know what?
[129:43.45]I don't think I would.
[129:44.71]This sounds really weird.
[129:46.25]Like, if it was a really strong magnet and you were just like, put this near your head.
[129:49.61]Like, sometimes I sit on my phone and I'm like, are my balls being cooked right now?
[129:53.56]Like, I don't legitimately think they are, but it kind of makes you think, like, why take the risk?
[129:58.68]Okay, so...
[130:00.70]Yeah, so you don't really like them.
[130:02.74]You know they work, you know what they do, but you're not a big fan of having them around, right?
[130:10.97]Yeah, I figure, like, why bother with magnets?
[130:15.09]I feel like we don't need magnets.
[130:17.59]There are detriments to magnets.
[130:20.23]Okay, the people that were saying true, you've lost them.
[130:25.20]I'm good at losing them.
[130:31.37]chat who anyone who's watching the stream right now take your cellular your cellular device let me make it don't do anything he's on it don't do anything he says don't do anything he ever says place it right underneath your crotch and just sit on your phone don't do anything he ever says this is a big disclaimer this is I do not condone anything he tells you to do okay we need to go down there's a
[130:54.67]But I'm not afraid of microwaves.
[130:57.96]They're a little weird.
[130:58.92]That's it.
[130:59.50]That's the only argument.
[131:01.80]Ow!
[131:02.00]Help.
[131:11.34]I have to get down there too, man.
[131:13.38]How am I going to do that?
[131:15.07]Climb.
[131:21.09]Holy shit.
[131:21.99]Okay, we're good.
[131:25.02]Help.
[131:27.28]Help me.
[131:28.32]Why would it be R?
[131:32.30]I really thought you'd let me die.
[131:34.52]Watch out, next to you!
[131:38.42]Zed!
[131:43.25]Okay, can you follow me?
[131:44.57]Yes.
[131:46.89]Watch out, watch out, watch out!
[131:47.97]Just follow me.
[131:55.32]You know, people come in my chat sometimes and are still mad that I dragged you through Terraria too quickly.
[132:00.78]What?
[132:01.34]It's like an ongoing disappointment in some people's lives.
[132:06.37]Well, because you, like, played Terraria while I watched?
[132:12.27]Yeah.
[132:14.13]I crafted, like, a bow and arrow, and you beat the game for me.
[132:18.55]Yeah, but it was a good time, right?
[132:19.43]It was a good time.
[132:19.81]I had a great time, yeah.
[132:20.47]That was fun.
[132:21.05]People are mad about that.
[132:22.47]Yeah.
[132:23.64]He didn't get to enjoy it himself.
[132:25.36]I did.
[132:25.60]No, it was great.
[132:27.28]I played Terraria a little bit.
[132:30.26]Not with all the mods.
[132:32.09]I had a great time.
[132:32.63]That was a lot of fun.
[132:36.05]I'm not buying it.
[132:36.73]Nice, dude.
[132:41.11]How does stamina work?
[132:44.86]Did you also not... You couldn't do it?
[132:48.64]Hey, let me know.
[132:50.26]Tell me if you think I did or didn't by how loud my Ernie laugh is.
[132:54.34]I can't do this.
[132:57.29]OK, we need to find another way up.
[133:05.99]OK.
[133:08.23]Jump defense.
[133:10.85]We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[133:11.99]You good?
[133:13.17]We're good.
[133:14.69]Oh, we got one of the... I heard the inhibitor nearby thing.
[133:18.47]We actually need to start doing that.
[133:20.67]Yeah, we're 12 meters.
[133:24.27]It's right this way.
[133:25.07]If you really did play Terraria, name the main character.
[133:28.15]Thomas Terraria.
[133:29.11]Thank you.
[133:32.01]What are we doing here?
[133:33.66]There's a person up here.
[133:36.60]There's a lot up here.
[133:41.98]Where is this going?
[133:43.37]Oh, there's a window down here we can go in.
[133:55.87]Someone's screaming.
[133:57.24]Someone's screaming down here.
[133:59.06]Screaming?
[134:01.56]Someone's in danger.
[134:02.90]Hurry.
[134:04.62]Loot this.
[134:06.12]Lots of stuff to loot, you're right.
[134:07.08]Fucking exalted.
[134:10.38]Let's go.
[134:10.72]I hear screaming.
[134:12.94]I don't hear any screaming.
[134:13.78]Where do you hear screaming?
[134:17.44]Oh, now I do.
[134:18.82]Shit hole indeed.
[134:26.03]Did you keep going down?
[134:27.57]I think the inhibitor might be in here somewhere.
[134:29.94]Yeah, it's definitely in here somewhere.
[134:39.32]I'm using gamer vision.
[134:40.84]Where did you go?
[134:42.09]I'm still in the house looking around.
[134:43.93]Oh, there's a we can climb up here.
[134:45.91]We can go up?
[134:46.97]Yeah, I found it.
[134:53.25]Oh shit, yep.
[135:00.92]Okay.
[135:01.98]Who's running around up here?
[135:03.32]I don't know.
[135:04.76]Someone had neighbors.
[135:06.18]Huge footsteps.
[135:08.39]Oh, there's a gamer up here.
[135:11.25]Oh, gamers.
[135:11.73]Oh, it's these two?
[135:13.31]We're making all that noise?
[135:20.11]Kids, I'm looking for a woman named Maya.
[135:25.13]What's so funny?
[135:26.77]Maya ain't a grown-up.
[135:28.11]She's just a plain old girl.
[135:29.65]Hold on.
[135:31.07]You were the one trying to sell a PK weapon to Hubert?
[135:34.81]Yeah, but the jerk didn't want it.
[135:37.13]Got all freaked out and chased me away.
[135:39.07]Okay.
[135:42.62]What's she holding?
[135:43.78]Is she holding a grenade?
[135:44.48]Yeah, it's a grenade.
[135:45.16]What?
[135:45.54]Yeah.
[135:45.92]Sugar.
[135:53.25]Oh, it's powder.
[135:56.33]Stop it.
[136:08.04]I just scolded you like we were on a road trip and you're like one of my kids in the car.
[136:11.92]Stop it.
[136:13.46]And I'm sick of how loud you're being.
[136:15.36]Stop it.
[136:16.31]Stop it.
[136:17.33]Enough.
[136:17.55]Okay.
[136:19.45]Okay.
[136:22.32]Okay, so, uh, report to Ator.
[136:27.96]We need to get that, uh... I got a point.
[136:30.78]Did you get a point?
[136:33.22]Uh, no.
[136:34.48]You should have.
[136:34.92]I mean, I got to do the stamina point?
[136:37.20]Yeah.
[136:38.08]I don't know what to put it in.
[136:40.67]Stamina or health?
[136:43.01]I did stamina.
[136:44.63]I don't know.
[136:46.69]Stamina's probably more important.
[136:47.91]Are you a tank or are you a bruiser?
[136:49.47]I'm gonna do stamina.
[136:53.85]I just feel like you really need that health.
[136:56.37]Look at the health bar.
[136:56.95]It's so tiny though.
[136:59.10]Yeah, just don't get hit.
[137:02.14]Okay, we gotta go do um... Oh, you want water by the way?
[137:10.10]Have you had some?
[137:11.02]Uh, no.
[137:11.56]I haven't had any water.
[137:12.50]That's not a Zed.
[137:13.28]Okay.
[137:27.80]will you tell them to stop sitting on their phones are they doing it I don't know but like I do you tell people to stop doing the thing you said do they want to have kids stop tell them to stop guys come on stop if you want to have kids stop but you really shouldn't there's enough people in the world uh there's an airdrop over there military airdrop we should go do that there might be like a gun there
[137:55.78]Let's do it.
[137:56.90]We should do it.
[137:57.80]We did two main story missions.
[137:59.16]We're good.
[137:59.48]Okay, let's go.
[138:13.14]Up on that roof across the way here.
[138:20.61]I'm killing them all.
[138:21.55]I'm actually murdering.
[138:25.89]I'll get these shrooms.
[138:26.53]Yep.
[138:27.17]Alright, if you were to give this game a... Wait, wait, wait.
[138:33.85]Why is it all green?
[138:34.45]It's this green... Where's this coming from?
[138:38.09]Chemicals?
[138:38.57]Poison?
[138:40.31]Are we poisoned right now?
[138:41.25]We gotta go.
[138:41.73]We're gonna get our immunity, the whole shroom thing.
[138:44.08]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[138:46.60]You were gonna... You were about to ask me like a... A thing?
[138:49.84]Oh, right.
[138:51.04]Uh, okay.
[138:51.56]If you were to score this game one out of a thousand.
[138:54.78]uh how what would you give it are we doing like Yu-Gi-Oh numbers for scores well just imagine like it's like an experience points you can put in and getting to 1 000 points levels you up to a 1 out of 10. I'm more confused now so so is it a score out of 10 000
[139:20.01]No, I mean, do you want to put enough experience points in the games to be like, yeah, I'm going to give this a rating?
[139:27.64]Um, there's parts of it that I feel like Dying Light 1 did better, but overall it's a good game.
[139:32.41]I could give it like a 9,000.
[139:33.39]Okay.
[139:35.98]It's taken a long time to level up, honestly.
[139:38.24]Wait a minute, so you have 800 points out of 1,000 into being ready to review the game.
[139:41.25]Is that correct?
[139:51.38]Oh, you're saying, like, how leveled up is my review?
[139:54.98]Yes.
[139:55.72]Not the score of the review.
[139:57.54]No, like, you need 1,000 experience points, like, in the game.
[140:00.49]Like, how much EXP do you have right now?
[140:01.99]800.
[140:04.59]No, no, no, no, no.
[140:05.65]I would say I have, like, 200.
[140:06.93]If we dropped it down to easy, then I would get, like, a journalist bonus of, like, 500.
[140:10.46]Oh, okay.
[140:10.84]I can feel you.
[140:21.30]What are we doing here?
[140:23.90]I'm just looking at the chat and people have no idea what's fucking happening.
[140:30.84]I barely know what's happening and you're talking to me.
[140:44.38]Now, I get what you're saying.
[140:45.02]The experience bar on are you ready to review this game or not is like a 200 out of 1,000 right now.
[140:49.98]And you're not going to play... You are not going to play, like, the 500 hours that it takes to beat this game.
[140:55.95]Yeah, so, like, what's my cutoff?
[140:59.07]That's for you to decide.
[141:00.01]Whenever you are experienced.
[141:02.03]I'm like a 200 right now.
[141:04.51]This area is weird.
[141:05.53]I think we have to go up this way.
[141:13.12]I think this is the Ubisoft climb, climb upper.
[141:16.20]There's a bunch, there's stuff up there though.
[141:17.50]I don't see any way outside here.
[141:23.48]Oh, my immunity.
[141:24.58]I'm getting whip whipped.
[141:25.66]Oh, this is actually really bad, yeah.
[141:26.68]Remember, this is the kind of conversation you have after huffing fumes.
[141:32.80]Man, I've been huffing.
[141:34.80]What's wrong?
[141:35.44]Oh.
[141:38.14]I think we've kind of run out of time here.
[141:39.70]Let's see if we can get up in there.
[141:43.21]I have shroomies.
[141:48.76]It looks like from here.
[141:51.20]Hold on.
[141:54.60]We're trying to get to the top of this building.
[141:57.05]What about on this side?
[142:00.01]There's that platform right here on top of me.
[142:02.39]How do we get to that one?
[142:06.73]I'm kind of worried that maybe we don't have like a... An ability for it?
[142:10.25]Oh, wait.
[142:11.11]The Metroidvania, yeah.
[142:12.33]I think there's a way to get over here.
[142:14.59]Yeah, there is.
[142:15.35]Come to me.
[142:16.41]Fucking Jesus!
[142:18.01]I actually almost just shit my pants.
[142:19.62]I'm serious.
[142:20.86]I just almost jumped off the building.
[142:22.30]I did the same thing!
[142:23.96]That's right.
[142:25.00]I'm not crazy.
[142:27.52]Yeah, but like... Now from here we can... We can keep going.
[142:32.78]Just keep going.
[142:34.70]We fully wrapped around.
[142:35.80]Okay, we go up here.
[142:39.98]Here we go.
[142:43.44]Nice.
[142:47.92]We're going up to the top.
[142:49.14]There should be a cache up here.
[142:51.84]Not this way?
[143:02.93]Oh, we got to do some jumpies.
[143:04.89]Oh, great.
[143:08.73]It'll be worth it, whatever's in here.
[143:11.29]I have no more shrooms left, so we gotta go.
[143:13.41]I've got shrooms if you really need them.
[143:16.29]I collected the artifact, the ancient artifact left behind by predecessors.
[143:19.53]Nice.
[143:23.18]Yeah.
[143:25.24]You can hide under this table if you want.
[143:29.10]There's a lot of them here.
[143:30.24]I wonder if somebody chases you eventually.
[143:31.88]Uh-oh.
[143:35.84]Uh-oh.
[143:36.36]Uh-oh.
[143:39.82]Oh, my God.
[143:40.86]What?
[143:41.66]Apparently, you can walk on that.
[143:43.24]You can?
[143:43.56]Okay.
[143:47.35]That was crazy.
[143:48.33]I can't believe you actually made that.
[143:49.49]Alright.
[143:55.99]I'm fine.
[143:58.25]I know you're turning the camera back because you know.
[144:01.29]You're like, here it goes.
[144:01.81]He's going to fall.
[144:03.35]I just want to make sure my little bro's making it.
[144:05.53]Make sure powder's alright.
[144:06.41]Alright.
[144:08.30]Here we are.
[144:11.55]Okay.
[144:12.75]Right here.
[144:14.33]Whatever this is.
[144:17.81]Okay.
[144:18.42]Are you about to turn, man?
[144:20.42]No, I'm good.
[144:25.72]I think I have immunity boosters.
[144:28.32]Military airdrop.
[144:29.60]Military tech.
[144:34.19]Okay, we got military tech.
[144:36.45]Is this an immunity booster?
[144:38.71]You go to a craft master to upgrade your tools.
[144:41.05]I need my tools.
[144:42.37]So that's an immunity booster.
[144:43.45]Yeah, alright.
[144:44.90]So the immunity booster fills up your immunity bar completely.
[144:49.10]Okay.
[144:50.44]The purple inhaler.
[144:53.24]Where's the Assassin's Creed?
[144:54.42]Jump down.
[144:55.04]Is that the only thing that was up here?
[144:56.94]Yeah.
[145:01.84]Like a zip line or a... You would think there would be something like that here, but apparently not.
[145:07.00]What the fuck?
[145:07.85]I thought you just turned into Wall-E on my screen.
[145:09.51]That was weird.
[145:12.21]Yeah.
[145:13.75]Okay.
[145:14.01]Do it.
[145:15.59]Um... It really should be.
[145:19.65]Here we go.
[145:21.69]They're right here.
[145:23.41]Okay.
[145:23.63]You ready?
[145:25.75]You're doing it?
[145:26.21]Oh my god, you're doing it.
[145:27.01]No, there's an Assassin's Creed thing right here.
[145:30.67]Okay, go for it.
[145:34.36]I made it.
[145:34.80]Okay.
[145:43.29]I'm critical.
[145:44.49]Are you actually?
[145:45.03]Do you have help?
[145:51.09]Yeah, no, we're good.
[145:51.67]We gotta run.
[145:52.77]Yeah, we actually do have to go.
[145:54.41]Alright, to the marker, or?
[145:57.64]To UV light, or any kind of light.
[146:01.22]Can't be out at night.
[146:01.92]It's dangerous.
[146:02.46]We're far away from that marker.
[146:05.38]Oh my fuck, this giant bubble.
[146:07.74]Is there fast travel?
[146:08.87]I think there is.
[146:09.35]Uh oh.
[146:12.99]We got squelchers.
[146:18.51]Quick, make a new meme.
[146:24.12]Oh shit, the chase started.
[146:27.36]We started the chase.
[146:29.98]Oh shit, the chase started.
[146:31.30]I want to see if you have what it takes to beat me.
[146:35.26]Top text, the chase started.
[146:36.78]Bottom text, oh no.
[146:40.39]I'm going to offer you $50,000 that says you can't beat me in trivia.
[146:47.29]Trade request.
[146:48.25]Alright, Beastie, here we go.
[146:50.05]That's what I'm talking about.
[147:00.66]You following me, Powder?
[147:11.18]She's such a misfit!
[147:13.06]Always ready to fight!
[147:14.33]She's got a super beam!
[147:16.15]And she's raising high!
[147:18.05]If you believe you're strong!
[147:22.33]So you know the whole song?
[147:23.27]I don't know.
[147:24.79]I heard like a minute of it.
[147:26.87]Okay.
[147:29.69]Okay, can we like not sleep or like pass time?
[147:34.02]We haven't really figured that out yet.
[147:36.14]There's a couch.
[147:36.76]You want to like chill on the couch?
[147:42.85]I'm laughing.
[147:44.57]Okay, yeah, we need to sleep.
[147:51.34]Why?
[147:56.28]I can't believe you did not react to me doing the VI theme song.
[148:01.00]Did you just pretend I wasn't doing that?
[148:02.48]Are those actually the words?
[148:04.67]Kind of.
[148:05.73]I don't know.
[148:07.17]All I know is, oh, the misery.
[148:10.75]Watch yourself.
[148:12.42]No, you don't.
[148:13.46]No.
[148:13.84]Wow.
[148:14.66]Fake fan.
[148:17.03]I'm not a fan.
[148:19.89]So we don't actually sleep here?
[148:22.57]Yeah, I feel like there must be a button to, like, pass the time.
[148:29.67]I thought that would be right here.
[148:32.74]Can you not do that on multiplayer?
[148:36.86]I don't know.
[148:39.80]We're going to survive the night and get the EXP bonus.
[148:42.14]How about that?
[148:43.22]I guess.
[148:44.94]What's our current objective?
[148:45.98]Oh, you can't sleep in all the safe houses.
[148:48.08]Only some.
[148:48.56]Report to Eeyore.
[148:50.03]Let's go.
[148:50.77]It's this direction.
[148:51.69]Okay.
[148:54.69]Beep, beep.
[148:55.71]Beep.
[148:59.01]Oh, the church.
[148:59.65]The church is right here, right?
[149:03.42]It's Sunday Mass, right?
[149:07.54]Oh, this is a point of interest.
[149:09.08]Yeah.
[149:12.64]We shot that.
[149:13.16]Does not work.
[149:18.45]So now we can sleep here.
[149:28.21]This is not.
[149:29.19]No, we're going to the other area.
[149:31.95]I don't need to sleep ever.
[149:33.61]OK, this is this is why the forces of evil fear the Nephilim.
[149:40.16]They never rest.
[149:45.74]What's your favorite Lord of the Rings movie?
[149:49.42]Um... Isn't there just one?
[149:55.93]Just one Lord of the Rings movie?
[149:58.37]Yeah, Lord of the Rings.
[150:04.63]Mine's, um... Mine's Return of the King.
[150:08.33]I like the part that Peter Jackson wanted to remove.
[150:11.33]It was my favorite part of the whole movie.
[150:12.67]And it's the one that he said is his least favorite thing he's ever done in cinema.
[150:16.01]That's my favorite scene.
[150:17.69]Which scene?
[150:18.15]I don't know too much about Lord of the Rings, honestly.
[150:20.21]The ghost people?
[150:21.55]The ghost ship people?
[150:24.65]I don't remember a ghost ship.
[150:29.21]Well, let me see if I can jog your memory.
[150:31.89]What say you?
[150:33.21]What say you?
[150:35.59]Does that help?
[150:37.78]no there was a ghost ship yeah this is like a SpongeBob reference no there was a a bunch of scenes where they were ghosts in like this tomb and they had to go to the tomb and get the uh the allegiance of the ghost people
[151:06.38]Pirates of the Caribbean?
[151:07.50]No, and the guy walks over and he's like, oh, you best not believe it in ghost stories because you're in one.
[151:12.84]And then they help them at that battle with the elephants and stuff.
[151:19.71]Debt will be repaid.
[151:23.13]You don't... This happened in that movie, right?
[151:30.19]I don't remember.
[151:30.85]I...
[151:35.93]It was the Gondor, the ghost of Gondor?
[151:38.27]Yeah.
[151:39.87]And they came in on a ship.
[151:41.93]They were in the movie for like 35 seconds.
[151:43.42]I believe you.
[151:43.86]Lord of the Gaslighting?
[151:45.70]Nobody even said that.
[151:46.26]I mean, I'm just trying to do quests and objectives here.
[152:05.68]Oh, no.
[152:05.96]I'm dead.
[152:08.68]Ow, my leg.
[152:12.60]Hold on.
[152:12.88]I'm gonna do some... I'm gonna do some crafting.
[152:18.30]You good?
[152:22.46]Ghosts owed Aragorn a debt.
[152:25.30]Yeah.
[152:29.46]And Peter Jackson said that was the worst thing he's ever done.
[152:33.37]He's like, he's like, I wish I fucking deleted that from the whole fucking movie.
[152:38.04]And I was like, what?
[152:38.68]I like that scene.
[152:42.26]Did you like it or did you like think it was funny?
[152:45.24]No, I actually liked it.
[152:46.38]I need a new topic.
[152:48.64]I don't know what's going on right now.
[152:50.11]I don't know what's real.
[152:50.99]I don't know what's not real.
[152:58.85]I owed Aragorn community subs.
[153:04.91]I don't know why that's so funny to me.
[153:11.97]Did you guys both take a tab of acid before playing this?
[153:14.63]No, it's been a while since Ster and I have, like, just played a game.
[153:19.31]What, we can't, like, we can't relax and have a good time and talk about microwaving stuff?
[153:24.76]Can't talk about magnets?
[153:26.52]I'm not all caught up on the microwaving and the other stuff.
[153:29.70]Like, this is new to me.
[153:30.56]You guys probably hear it every single day.
[153:32.62]But I didn't, I didn't know the microwave lore.
[153:39.17]Oh, we were helping the guy from here doing a quest or something, and now we're reporting back.
[153:45.63]So we're completing the quest, whatever it was that we did for him.
[153:51.12]Oh, so look for Eeyore.
[153:52.94]He's inside, right?
[153:56.84]He's inside.
[153:58.60]Okay.
[154:05.21]I need all the characters.
[154:05.99]I need all the players here.
[154:08.63]excuse me I'm here so so you're comfortable microwaving popcorn even though it kind of scares you but you'll eat you'll eat the popcorn I'm not afraid of microwaves they just are a little odd
[154:33.37]So wouldn't you just rather pop your popcorn on like the stovetop?
[154:36.57]It actually is.
[154:37.17]It actually is kind of better that way anyways.
[154:39.95]I hear that.
[154:42.22]Get a nice little crisp to it.
[154:43.64]But you do the thing that everybody accidentally does and you put way too much kernels in.
[154:49.14]You think you're going to have... Oh, no, that's not enough.
[154:52.40]Let me just tell you right now, it's enough.
[154:53.94]That first scoop is enough.
[154:56.21]Honestly, you're kind of making me want to pop some popcorn.
[155:01.05]Yeah, no, you should.
[155:03.55]But, like, I don't have a microwave.
[155:05.33]So, you know, old-fashioned.
[155:06.93]I won't have to, like, worry about the radiation.
[155:09.61]I love popcorn on the stove.
[155:10.67]It's awesome.
[155:11.47]But you end up doing way too much and then it just gets everywhere.
[155:14.44]We got to talk to Khan.
[155:15.88]I just saw a ladder and I was like, I'm going to climb that.
[155:26.85]You know what else is really good?
[155:28.45]Can you come over here?
[155:29.45]I'm trying to get down.
[155:30.67]I didn't think you were looking at me.
[155:32.30]Have you ever toasted your own sunflower seeds?
[155:34.70]No.
[155:34.94]So you buy just raw sunflower seeds.
[155:36.56]Taken out of the shell.
[155:47.90]And you just put them in lightly.
[155:48.80]You're going to take them all out of the shell yourself?
[155:50.82]No, no, no.
[155:51.16]Just buy the ones that are out of the shell.
[155:52.55]They sell raw, untoasted.
[155:54.15]You can do it yourself.
[155:54.87]Okay.
[155:55.45]Yeah, okay.
[155:56.09]I'm like a king.
[155:57.47]I don't have time for that.
[155:59.09]But you can control the amount of salt you put on and any other little things you want to add to it, too.
[156:03.62]I don't really add a lot of things, you know?
[156:05.16]I'm kind of like
[156:07.08]kind of basic just put a little salt on it it's good it's really easy too why I don't know because it's fun to do the new things it's fun to like experience our world why what do you mean why I mean why put salt on it why not just toast it oh okay just um you could but the flavor wouldn't it'd be kind of we're going this way it'd be a little dull
[156:34.82]Ster know that you grew sunflowers.
[156:36.56]I think so.
[156:37.10]Do you hear about the sunflowers?
[156:38.64]I know.
[156:40.58]Why would you know about that, actually, now that I think about it?
[156:42.45]That's very weird.
[156:45.51]It was like 10 feet tall.
[156:46.91]It was huge.
[156:47.39]Huh.
[156:51.72]And then you toast at your own sunflowers.
[156:54.66]I gather from this tale.
[156:57.22]No, you didn't.
[156:57.96]I didn't.
[156:58.24]You just grew sunflowers.
[157:01.38]Me and my girlfriend, we put them into a container.
[157:05.61]And we're going to plant.
[157:06.51]We're going to pick out the ones.
[157:07.89]We're going to plant them again next season.
[157:10.33]Why did I say it like that?
[157:11.09]Next season.
[157:11.53]I don't know.
[157:15.85]Wait, so.
[157:17.71]Okay.
[157:19.19]So we're not going to eat them.
[157:20.05]We're going to replant them.
[157:22.67]Because here's the thing about growing plants, if you don't know, Ster.
[157:26.29]I don't.
[157:27.00]If you want to grow, let's say, sunflowers, you don't just plant one sunflower in the ground and go, okay, because it might not actually grow.
[157:34.12]Oh, you don't plant one.
[157:35.96]Okay, I didn't know that.
[157:37.07]I thought you just did one sunflower.
[157:39.25]And then you were like, good.
[157:41.87]And then like a whole field of them would grow.
[157:44.46]No, my point is if you want, let's say you want like two or three sunflowers in the same area.
[157:48.88]You have to plant like 15 in that kind of small zone.
[157:52.82]And then you have to get rid of the stragglers.
[157:54.76]It's called thinning.
[157:56.14]It's actually really sad.
[157:58.17]Some of them are just not strong enough.
[158:02.35]It is sad.
[158:03.29]It is.
[158:03.59]No, it is sad.
[158:04.07]Well, what if you take the stragglers and you move them somewhere else?
[158:10.81]Yeah, you could.
[158:11.19]They get their own space.
[158:12.13]You could, but they might not go.
[158:13.56]They might not keep going.
[158:16.77]This is a really weird first date.
[158:20.42]It's in these microwaves.
[158:21.66]Let me tell you something.
[158:22.28]You ever put a magnet on your head?
[158:27.44]Why don't you sit on your cellular device?
[158:29.20]It's called... You have to thin out your sunflower seeds and it's sad.
[158:32.38]I can't plant them all on you.
[158:36.89]This guy has so much to say.
[158:40.67]Go that way.
[158:41.71]Go that way.
[158:42.15]Okay.
[158:42.45]You'll see a giant man.
[158:43.65]Okay.
[158:46.24]Yeah, we actually gave some as gifts.
[158:50.50]We took them out.
[158:53.26]Okay, yeah, let me mail you a sunflower.
[158:56.08]That would be pretty cool.
[158:57.61]It wouldn't make it.
[158:59.07]Why wouldn't it make it?
[159:02.59]Oh, shit, Tibbs?
[159:06.51]You should email him a sunflower.
[159:08.78]Like, I didn't hear the story.
[159:10.22]I didn't see a picture.
[159:11.16]My name's...
[159:14.59]You're you're you're off stream.
[159:17.79]Life is a mystery to me.
[159:19.13]Like much of a choice.
[159:20.11]I'm curious what you do as hobbies here because you show up hobbies yesterday.
[159:24.53]You make you show up like for a New Year stream and then you're gone till next New Year's.
[159:28.11]It's like, what are you doing in the meanwhile?
[159:31.33]Looking for a job.
[159:32.66]I don't know.

[160:07.87]I was looking for some support is what I was looking for.
[160:16.51]Well, I'll support you when I know what it is.
[160:18.19]Alright.
[160:19.03]So we got to get some work at the Bazaar and earn Sophie's trust.
[160:22.39]Okay.
[160:23.05]It's a tree.
[160:26.01]You can get they come in different sizes.
[160:28.21]Okay.

[160:41.46]That's it?
[160:45.22]Okay, I can upgrade your blueprint if you bring me infected trophies.
[160:51.25]13 infected trophies?
[160:52.61]Why is this guy T-posing?
[161:00.43]Yeah, I like all the parts of this game that aren't, like, talking to people.
[161:06.22]Well, I mean, you have to sell items and stuff.
[161:08.90]Yeah, but, like, all the crap... Like, I just like running around the city and there being, you know, zombies and, you know, you looting.
[161:14.78]Holy shit, this is so much more damage than what I have.
[161:18.49]25?
[161:18.51]I'm on it.
[161:24.91]Like, I don't... I don't... Get some work at the bazaar and... From who?
[161:31.24]We got a lot of good weapons now.
[161:36.20]Uh-oh.
[161:37.35]Do I have your permission?
[161:39.53]Permission for what?
[161:40.91]You took too long.
[161:42.07]Oh, quest giver.
[161:42.73]Okay.
[161:43.03]Okay.
[162:02.14]Hey, as a streamer, maybe you'd like everything else more if you'd actually talk to anyone.
[162:09.99]I mean, people have a point, right?
[162:11.29]Like, we're not immersing ourselves in the story.
[162:14.68]We're literally just going as fast as we can to go swing chivalry weapons at people.
[162:19.74]I'm immersed in the parts that I want to be immersed in, which is like hanging out with an identical clone of myself and just like having a good time jumping around rafters and jumping off buildings and doing monkey swings.
[162:31.41]I don't think we got... We didn't get a mission from that person.
[162:35.89]Okay, yeah, we have to go talk to someone else now.
[162:45.15]All players.
[162:46.29]Uh-huh.
[162:47.41]Okay.
[162:48.39]And see, then this guy's like, oh, I'll give you a job.
[162:50.57]You want a job?
[162:51.38]I think you gotta play CODs.
[162:54.96]A job.
[162:55.76]Oh, you want a job?
[162:56.80]I got any work I could do?
[162:57.90]It's like, how did the conversation take that long?
[162:59.74]Is that wedding ring on the wrong finger?
[163:02.34]Come on.
[163:02.74]Don't fuck with me.
[163:04.01]I'm serious.
[163:04.73]Well, then it's not a wedding ring.
[163:05.89]You barge in here like you own the place.
[163:07.89]Takes coconut sized balls.
[163:12.69]Okay.
[163:14.41]It's just a ring, dude.
[163:17.15]Oh.
[163:18.71]This is a ring, but... It's a ring.
[163:23.73]Oh.
[163:24.90]Wait, why did I ask why?
[163:26.24]Okay, he gave us a small job, and I think we can handle it.
[163:32.36]The ball's in your court.
[163:33.56]Alright.
[163:33.96]Track that.
[163:36.68]Now we're going to earn their trust.
[163:38.42]Once we have their trust, we're going to slit their throats, I think.
[163:48.99]We are the Valiant Infantry.
[163:52.61]Oh my god, man.
[163:53.41]Isn't that coming up?
[163:55.17]EDF 6?
[163:56.87]Yeah, it is.
[163:59.65]I'm going to beg you to play that and then play it for a day and then never talk to you again.
[164:05.42]like I said you would yep I was like oh yeah real fun we'll play again sometime and then like uh I think three years went by oh I'm sorry I never apologized for that these bad guys yeah
[164:32.04]I'm not going to take the first swing because it's even.
[164:34.38]It's not funny.
[164:35.32]Do you think it's funny to just hit people and be mean all the time?
[164:41.63]We got to climb this building over here.
[164:48.25]Oh yeah, but we're playing EDF6, right?
[164:51.36]Maybe.
[164:51.64]I don't know.
[164:52.48]It depends if it's going to be good.
[164:58.52]Why wouldn't it be good?
[164:59.16]I don't know.
[165:02.55]Those games are so much fun, though.
[165:06.18]Yeah, so why do you doubt?
[165:09.08]I mean, they take a long time to play, though.
[165:12.48]If you're going to play EDF, it's not just like, yeah, you know, I'll play EDF for an hour.
[165:15.96]You have to commit like 100 hours to EDF for it to be fun.
[165:20.24]Or at least like 30.
[165:20.68]Um... What the fuck?
[165:29.09]Hubert?
[165:30.15]You here?
[165:31.43]Dodger sent me.
[165:33.34]Did he?
[165:38.52]Oh, we got to find a way inside.
[165:43.50]It's so pretty.
[165:44.28]It really is.
[165:48.89]Window?
[165:54.69]I'm not sure where you're going, but I'm going to follow you.
[165:56.33]I mean, I see a door over there.
[165:59.90]I thought there might be a window somewhere.
[166:01.30]We're trying to get in here.
[166:02.30]Oh, there's a window right here.
[166:06.09]Zeds.
[166:06.79]Zeds, bro, I need your help, bro!
[166:07.89]Thanks for the subs.
[166:11.82]I'm trying to get off.
[166:13.88]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out!
[166:17.26]Oh, came with a weapon this time!
[166:18.64]Oh.
[166:19.02]There's, uh... There's, like, tracks.
[166:36.45]Yeah, because we're trying to figure out where the guy went.
[166:38.67]Oh, cool.
[166:39.25]And his place appears to be infested.
[166:42.23]You know, from context clues.
[166:45.71]But I'm just kind of looting.
[166:46.71]Kind of what you do.
[166:48.37]Yeah, I'm just opening up these boxes.
[166:50.99]We're going to have to make it into the final circle soon, though.
[166:56.25]Okay.
[166:59.42]I see there's footprints.
[167:00.22]There they go.
[167:06.60]I'll be up.
[167:07.28]No.
[167:08.56]Can we climb this?
[167:09.10]That looks like we're going to be going down.
[167:19.19]Where do we go from here?
[167:24.04]Woodrope.
[167:26.54]Yeah, we just got to check and make sure there's not like another world in there.
[167:31.38]Oh, we got a tunnel.
[167:34.49]Perfect.
[167:34.93]He's definitely down here.
[167:35.97]A secret gremlin tunnel.
[167:39.05]Where you climb around in here for a little bit and then you jump in the pool.
[167:42.17]Yeah.
[167:43.15]You gotta jump in the pool after.
[167:44.23]Hello?
[167:51.98]It's Hector.
[167:52.64]What are you doing?
[168:03.00]This is for rage.
[168:03.90]How'd you find my secret entrance?
[168:06.36]You call that a secret?
[168:08.34]It was supposed to be.
[168:10.22]You're out of luck though, buddy.
[168:11.94]I still... I bet... He hurt his leg.
[168:15.22]You're going to have to put him down.
[168:17.38]That's why I don't have... I think one of us is going to have to carry him.
[168:21.18]Nah.
[168:22.87]Wait.
[168:23.43]Don't go back to him.
[168:24.79]No matter.
[168:26.21]He won't give a shit.
[168:28.97]Can you go for me?
[168:29.87]And where...
[168:34.14]It's a lot of choices.
[168:35.06]Which one?
[168:37.70]I'll be back soon.
[168:38.52]Sounded like a conversation ender.
[168:41.93]It did, yeah.
[168:46.49]I gather we have to go loot.
[168:47.89]Like he was sent to go do a thing, but he hurt his leg and he's going to get put down like a horse and he can't do it.
[168:52.61]So we have to go do it for him.
[168:54.27]And then like he's going to get the credit.
[168:58.50]We're not supposed to go this way.
[169:00.06]Yeah, the other way.
[169:00.54]Do you have a knack for that?
[169:02.50]I just, I see arrows that are on the ground and I look at them.
[169:08.86]I'm going to send that guy to the glue factory.
[169:12.97]What the fuck?
[169:19.89]Ow.
[169:21.05]Um.
[169:22.45]How did I trip?
[169:23.58]I tripped.
[169:24.20]You want to listen to them?
[169:32.04]It's the same guy.
[169:32.64]I think they're just talking.
[169:37.98]Is it really normal for you?
[169:40.53]Yep, same guy.
[169:41.79]Are they going to notice him fall?
[169:46.07]No, they're not.
[169:50.33]I think I helped.
[169:55.82]Keep falling.
[169:58.78]Keep going.
[169:59.22]Aww.
[170:07.81]Okay, we got distracted.
[170:08.85]Do you want to just, like, just get distracted?
[170:12.09]Do you want to just, like, wander?
[170:13.23]Or are we doing quests?
[170:14.63]I mean, we're already on this quest.
[170:15.87]Let's just finish this one.
[170:16.61]Okay.
[170:19.79]I just want to, you know, go to some dangerous locales and find some, you know, interesting... Go down to the metro.
[170:26.49]Find out what's going on there.
[170:28.01]What's with all these zombies?
[170:29.67]I don't know.
[170:30.21]What is with it?
[170:30.71]It's crazy.
[170:32.78]Like, no one's talking about this.
[170:38.61]No one's even talking about this happening.
[170:42.45]Everywhere we go, it's like, oh, go here and pick up my supplies.
[170:45.42]Like, they're zombies.
[170:46.40]No one's gonna... Wow.
[170:48.58]See you later.
[170:49.98]Okay.
[170:58.38]59 meters.

[171:45.13]These fucking guys in the party will do anything.
[171:49.63]Who made this game?
[171:53.37]Who made this game?
[171:55.25]Um, Pyro?
[171:56.50]Pyrand?
[171:59.58]Techland, yeah.
[172:01.78]What else has Techland made?
[172:05.00]They made dying light.
[172:06.84]Besides that, obviously.
[172:10.16]I need you to help.
[172:12.66]Dead Island, that's what it was.
[172:16.04]I swear that was them.

[172:22.39]You guys need help?
[172:23.61]We'll be fine, thanks.
[172:25.37]What happened?
[172:27.35]I'm going to skip the tyrant.
[172:30.61]He's just two other players.
[172:32.97]And we're like pretending not to be in the same game.
[172:36.37]Oh, we're going down.
[172:39.55]Holy shit.
[172:40.27]Trash doesn't hurt either.
[172:41.05]You can go down too.
[172:55.99]Yeah, there's nothing here.
[172:57.33]Looks like we're going down.
[172:58.35]Elevator?
[173:04.01]Alright, cool.
[173:08.32]Oh, we should turn off the generator.
[173:12.52]Did we turn it off?
[173:15.84]I can't see anything.
[173:17.42]Why did we do that?
[173:19.85]Dark down here.
[173:20.83]That just gave us a problem.
[173:26.71]Okay, you go first.
[173:27.45]I got your back.
[173:27.95]Alright, I'm going first.
[173:32.13]Howler, straight ahead.
[173:33.05]Alright, we gotta find the GRE container.
[173:49.28]Good.
[173:50.44]Easy.
[173:52.92]Easy.
[173:53.08]You're aggroing.
[173:54.58]Am I?
[173:56.34]You aggroed him.
[173:58.22]Did I?
[173:58.75]What are you talking about?
[173:59.69]You aggroed him.
[174:01.17]No, no, what?
[174:05.91]You're doing fake E3 gamer trailer.
[174:07.99]No, we're not.
[174:09.39]Oh my god, I'm aggroing him.
[174:10.37]I'm the tank.
[174:11.01]You're aggroing.
[174:12.40]You're aggroing.
[174:13.44]Let's walk away.
[174:14.04]Uh-oh, we're aggroing.
[174:16.58]There's a dude right here.
[174:17.80]You aggroed!

[174:58.87]Fucking God!
[175:00.69]It's intense!
[175:01.23]Stop for one second!
[175:02.89]You need a heal?

[175:04.69]Let's patch you back up!
[175:07.75]Thanks, man.
[175:09.13]Jeez.
[175:09.37]That's my last one.
[175:11.55]Oh, shit, man.
[175:12.19]My light.
[175:13.09]My light's flickering out.
[175:14.89]What?
[175:16.01]I can't see a thing.
[175:17.07]Oh, man.
[175:18.29]Oh, man.
[175:18.81]I'm gonna have to follow you.
[175:20.30]Okay, guys.
[175:22.54]I can't see either, man.
[175:23.96]I can't see either.
[175:24.62]There could be one anywhere.
[175:27.36]I sneezed.
[175:29.70]It turns it back on.
[175:33.12]There's a volatile down here.
[175:34.19]We're doomed.
[175:36.45]Oh, what's all this goop?
[175:38.53]Guy.
[175:38.97]Guy.
[175:40.53]I think he's dead, man.
[175:41.75]I think he's dead.
[175:42.57]Yeah, he is now.
[175:44.07]Yeah, I took the assassin perk.
[175:45.95]Oh, my God.
[175:46.53]Watch out.
[175:47.55]Ow, my heart.
[175:48.31]My fucking body hurts.
[175:49.33]That was so fucked up.
[175:51.03]He just touched you, grabbed you.
[175:53.88]Kill him.
[175:54.26]Kill him.
[175:55.04]Kill him.
[175:55.36]Alright, man.
[175:57.56]I don't know, dude.
[175:58.38]I think... Can we play Mario or something?
[176:02.04]You going to be okay, man?
[176:04.14]Can we play the Mario Kart or something?
[176:05.42]Dude, I don't think I can do this.
[176:08.15]This isn't a game.
[176:08.89]Don't hit those.
[176:12.32]Don't hit those.
[176:19.36]Sorry.
[176:19.72]I'm sorry.
[176:20.14]I was so confused because it was moving around but not spraying on my screen.
[176:25.13]It was just like doing a worm move.
[176:28.31]Okay.
[176:28.77]Okay.
[176:30.07]Where's the GRE container?
[176:31.25]It's alright.
[176:31.59]We'll turn on the generator.
[176:32.67]Get some light in here.
[176:38.99]Everything's going to be okay.
[176:42.11]There's a Zed in there.
[176:44.03]Oh, container!
[176:46.13]This is the room we... This is where we came from.
[176:55.65]Watch out, get this loop.
[176:58.43]Oh, shit.
[176:59.14]Not again.
[176:59.58]We're going to have to run.
[177:00.26]I don't want to do that again.
[177:02.76]I don't want to do the acting routine again.
[177:05.86]We need to find the container.
[177:07.04]Come on.
[177:12.13]Are we going down this way?
[177:13.51]I don't know.
[177:14.57]We have to find one of those things.
[177:18.65]The indicator didn't beep yet.
[177:19.99]I think this is the military storage area Hubert told me about.
[177:22.55]Yeah, it's down here.
[177:23.27]Okay, I'm going.
[177:28.79]I'm a runner.
[177:31.97]Are you actually just running through this?
[177:33.61]Yeah, I'm a runner.
[177:35.13]Fucking idiots.
[177:39.87]Call it next time then.
[177:41.17]Call it now.
[177:41.85]I don't want to be fucking mad, dude, but call it next time.
[177:44.33]I called it.
[177:44.97]I don't know where to go.
[177:46.39]Dead end, bro.
[177:47.03]Fucking dead end, bro.
[177:54.66]Through here.
[177:55.26]Through here.
[177:55.80]Go through the fucking door.
[177:57.30]God damn it, man.
[177:58.32]Up this way.
[177:59.08]Up here.
[177:59.46]Not playing games with you again.
[178:04.78]This isn't funny, bro.
[178:08.35]Help me.
[178:09.05]Watch my back.
[178:09.55]I'm turning on the lights.
[178:10.55]Yeah.
[178:11.39]Nah, I'm just not fucking going to play a game anymore.
[178:16.31]Are there dodgers in this game?
[178:19.06]Go play fucking COD, you fucking idiot.
[178:23.58]Oh, wait, you're locked, the guy.
[178:24.66]I need you.
[178:25.58]Hey.
[178:26.02]Yep, I'm on it.
[178:27.93]Job's up.
[178:38.95]I got it.
[178:39.61]Stop.
[178:44.95]Oh, coffee.
[178:46.83]Oh, Cheetos.
[178:48.91]Roadie best.
[178:51.47]Cheetos.
[178:52.55]Chicken.
[178:53.33]Yeah.
[178:54.33]How did they not put any of that back in this game?
[178:58.08]We've been playing for like two hours.
[178:59.56]I haven't seen one coffee Cheetos or chicken because I don't think any of those items are actually in the game.
[179:07.49]Coffee was.
[179:08.77]Was it?
[179:09.77]It was.
[179:10.63]Yes.
[179:12.97]Oh, we got a box.
[179:13.73]You're acting like there were Cheetos in the game.
[179:16.05]There were no Cheetos.
[179:17.20]There was no Cheetos, but there was coffee, and we haven't seen coffee yet, and I'm upset.
[179:26.32]You said we weren't going to do the bit unless you found it.
[179:30.34]But we're not going to find it.
[179:32.48]You're just giving up.
[179:36.06]Oh!
[179:38.06]No!
[179:38.76]I thought that was coffee.
[179:39.52]Some cigars?
[179:40.06]Yeah, these cigars.
[179:41.02]Oh, we have all this stuff here.
[179:42.93]Okay.
[179:43.19]Of course I got a heel.
[180:05.40]You know, I've been crafting healing items.
[180:08.03]I don't have any of the stuff.
[180:12.13]There's still a few more somewhere.
[180:19.59]Oh, we're searching containers.
[180:22.07]A lot of stuff over there.
[180:24.21]I see.
[180:24.75]I'm hacking in with my hack stick.
[180:32.28]I do like the idea of a hack stick.
[180:34.38]I think it's cool.
[180:36.58]Oh, we got a hammer.
[180:38.78]I like a hack stick, but I think it's way cooler if you put it on the end of an arrow and then you shoot it into a USB port.
[180:47.04]Dude, it would never go in right the first way.
[180:48.88]It would bounce off because you didn't have it the right way like all USB sticks.
[180:53.39]And then you shoot it a second time.
[180:55.69]I can't open that box.
[180:58.27]Hey, bro.
[181:00.73]Bro.
[181:02.11]Oh, man, dude, it's bad.
[181:03.23]It's...
[181:18.85]That was such an enorme joke.
[181:26.13]Nobody said that, I did.
[181:29.96]What's with these fake boxes where it's only like an inch deep?
[181:38.10]Yeah, it's almost like this sh- this sh- this is like a- this is a magic trick case.
[181:42.28]Yeah, the body's in the bottom.
[181:44.40]The real thing is underneath.
[181:45.82]You open it, then you close it.
[181:47.06]You press the magic button that lifts this too, and then the other thing is in there.
[181:51.53]Are you really giving away the whole trick?
[181:54.71]Yeah, that's like... That's how it works.
[181:57.49]That's not cool.
[181:59.65]Did I just turn that offer on?
[182:02.26]It was on.
[182:04.57]We're looking for, we're going to search one more box.
[182:06.97]Wait, was this it?
[182:10.25]Okay.
[182:10.47]We, we got it.
[182:11.27]Apparently we got everything of value.
[182:13.27]Nice.
[182:13.83]Time to head out of here.
[182:15.61]Oh, you, you, you really need some DS thing on that bro.
[182:21.08]Okay, bro.
[182:26.90]Please climb over here.
[182:29.06]That hurt me.
[182:30.82]Did it?
[182:32.42]I think this thing's bobbed.
[182:33.48]Yep.
[182:33.68]There's bobbed.
[182:34.18]Yep.
[182:35.04]You made it though.
[182:38.52]But how did you make it over?
[182:39.34]I don't know.
[182:40.27]I did the skip.
[182:43.21]Oh.
[182:43.37]Okay.
[182:43.57]I got it.
[182:49.03]Oh.
[182:49.23]Back.
[182:49.69]Other way.
[182:52.70]Oh.
[182:52.82]We got to move this.
[182:53.54]We have...
[182:56.15]It's like a piece of wood.
[182:59.34]Get over it, Aiden.
[183:01.24]He's a plywood.
[183:03.62]Do you know how they make plywood?
[183:07.26]From wood?
[183:08.47]They spin a tree.
[183:10.81]They shave a tree really thinly and they mush all the pieces together that they shave with water and stuff and glue.
[183:26.53]I'm hearing ghosts I think we can leave this game's fun wow did you find the stash sure did thanks for the lock picks but what are you still doing here is this him sure is there's kind enough to get the goods for us
[183:49.56]Saved us a lot of trouble.
[183:50.98]Very good.
[183:52.28]So... He's got a fanny pack.
[183:54.67]There's a lot of people doing this game, actually.
[183:58.69]Well, it's cool now.
[183:59.69]Like, Kanye brought it back.
[184:01.49]I'm just kidding.
[184:02.07]I don't care.
[184:03.43]You should care.
[184:04.09]It's fashion.
[184:05.01]And now we don't need you.
[184:07.00]So, do we get counted?
[184:10.30]More people keep coming on, like, from stage left and stage right.
[184:13.00]Oh, wait, do we fight?
[184:13.70]Oh, shit.
[184:14.22]Oh, my God.
[184:15.74]Oh, kill him.
[184:17.12]I thought that was in the game.
[184:18.81]I thought that was one of the people here.
[184:22.33]Hey, how are we going to do this?
[184:23.63]What tactical way are we going to...
[184:43.32]Oh, yeah, you can't block power attacks.
[184:45.20]I'm down.
[184:45.82]Oh, are you dead?
[184:46.74]Yeah.
[184:49.48]Wait, wait, wait.
[184:50.96]Just hide on the truck.
[184:51.98]How much health do you have?
[184:54.75]How much time do you have?
[184:58.71]Oh, my God.
[185:00.91]Blow this up.
[185:01.49]Oh, there's a corpse under here.
[185:05.69]It's going to be me.
[185:08.95]I got you.
[185:10.19]Come on, Gwen.
[185:10.53]Let's go.
[185:11.29]Let's get this going.
[185:12.67]Come on, Gwen.
[185:14.09]Watch out.
[185:20.89]Wow, he's just taking it.
[185:21.75]He's just taking it.
[185:23.36]His head is thick.
[185:33.73]He just popped him up like we were on a trampoline.
[185:36.33]What the fuck was that?
[185:51.11]You do these gigantic swings with two-handed swords in this game and the person's head goes... Why do these guys have so many... Okay, I'm taking out two-hander too.
[186:05.62]Two-hander versus two-hander.
[186:12.14]I'm on the map.
[186:17.64]How much health does this guy have?
[186:30.51]I don't have any health potions left.
[186:32.09]Well, whatever they are.
[186:32.77]Hold on, mate!
[186:34.93]Time out!
[186:35.55]Time out!
[186:35.89]Time out!
[186:36.19]Time out!
[186:37.01]Time out!
[186:42.69]Help!
[186:47.72]Help!
[186:48.50]Are we... Why is this taking us so long?
[186:51.18]I don't know, because our weapons are made out of duct tape, maybe?
[187:00.06]There might be health in that box to your left.
[187:01.96]He didn't even come close.
[187:05.01]What was that hitbox?
[187:09.71]He just Berserker Whirlwinded.
[187:12.45]Take one of these.
[187:15.70]I can't even look over there.
[187:21.76]You are off camera fighting these people.
[187:24.18]I'm coming into camera.
[187:25.74]I'm just waiting for a body to fly across the screen like...
[187:36.38]Yeah, um... This is just like... I feel like we're LARPing.
[187:44.68]And I'm really disappointed right now because I feel like that sucks.
[187:47.32]I came here, I dressed up, I brought my huge sword that I had crafted.
[187:51.10]And somebody tagged me in the leg and it was like, Dad!
[187:53.14]And it's like, come on, dude.
[187:54.08]Really, I get to watch the cool part now?
[187:58.99]I got you.
[188:01.62]I have to watch you do that.
[188:02.72]They're not gonna stop me.
[188:04.90]Get up, buddy.
[188:05.84]You're fine.
[188:06.21]You can stop fucking crying about it.
[188:10.29]Take this, motherfucker.
[188:16.63]Yeah, you missed.
[188:18.85]By the way.
[188:19.32]There's something in this chest.
[188:29.85]I love when they have, like, a single stream of blood coming out of their body.
[188:33.08]Yeah, that was weird.
[188:34.18]Like, snakes just came out of him.
[188:36.08]Snakes.
[188:37.90]Okay, honest to God, why is it taking so long?
[188:47.23]There's a skeleton here.
[188:52.21]I'm in pain.
[188:55.99]He's coming up behind you.
[189:05.11]Done.
[189:06.30]No, it's not.
[189:11.00]What?
[189:12.58]Where's his weapon?
[189:13.62]What happened?
[189:14.08]What is the weapon?
[189:15.68]What?
[189:15.90]He doesn't have a weapon.
[189:17.81]His head is gone.
[189:19.21]What's going on?
[189:34.73]We're on sets here.
[189:35.65]This is a guy in a costume.
[189:39.97]This isn't even a guy.
[189:40.95]I'm dead.
[189:41.58]No, please.
[189:46.04]I couldn't save you, gas can.
[189:48.00]I don't think he can die now.
[189:50.45]You cut his head off and it just kept swinging.
[189:53.23]Can you pull me to you?
[189:55.21]No, you're dead, man.
[189:56.21]No, I'm alive again.
[189:57.11]Can you pull me?
[190:00.01]No, I can't.
[190:00.64]Are you still running away from that guy?
[190:03.46]He's dancing now.
[190:06.40]Hold on.
[190:06.76]I'm coming to you.
[190:14.57]He thinks I'm invisible.
[190:17.63]I gotta get there quick.
[190:27.04]That was so stupid.
[190:28.24]Okay, on my screen he didn't have a weapon.
[190:30.36]And then his head came off.
[190:32.04]Yeah, you walked up to the side of him and cut his head off.
[190:34.72]And he dropped his weapon and he just started punching at you.
[190:36.88]I thought it was like a... I thought the game was doing an actual chicken headless joke.
[190:43.20]Hold on, keep him there, keep him there.
[190:44.70]We gotta take this guy somewhere.
[190:46.52]I'm almost there.
[190:49.20]He's still here.
[190:50.55]I mean, we didn't get the reward for the quest.
[190:52.65]We didn't?
[190:54.11]What's going on here?
[190:54.75]Are you able to get in here?
[191:02.75]I'm in trouble, hold on.
[191:05.51]I ran into a... Who's playing a clown horn?
[191:08.03]What was that?
[191:12.76]Somebody's just like, oh, look at me.
[191:18.05]God damn it.
[191:18.85]Okay, I gotta run.
[191:21.29]You're not far.
[191:21.95]Just come in, man.
[191:23.21]Oh, shit.
[191:24.63]Run, run, run, run, run.
[191:26.27]Okay, I'm coming.
[191:32.71]Yeah, I don't know how you... Alright, so where is he?
[191:46.64]I can hear him swearing Yeah, he's still talking You motherfucker
[192:09.21]We didn't get the quest reward?
[192:10.45]What are we supposed to do about this?
[192:11.89]I think we're supposed to go turn in the quest to the guy now.
[192:14.11]Because it's giving me the other marker.
[192:20.46]If you press Q, you can still see his head.
[192:22.46]It's there.
[192:22.88]So we can just leave.
[192:28.22]He's going to kill me.
[192:31.83]How are you this good?
[192:36.91]Can we kill him again?
[192:37.58]I don't think we can kill him again.
[192:43.82]Let's go.
[192:44.42]Yeah, run.
[192:46.66]Okay, wrap around here because there was like a weird quest where this guy was handcuffed.
[192:52.75]Oh, so you want to go unhandcuff him?
[192:54.73]Yeah, I tried to.
[192:55.95]He's right over here.
[192:56.43]Do you want to go do the awooga thing?
[192:58.49]Yeah, he's over here.
[193:08.10]Okay, they grouped up now.
[193:09.24]Yeah, do it.
[193:20.36]Aw, damn it.
[193:24.04]Another headless guy.
[193:25.24]Oh, no.
[193:25.46]He's staying down.
[193:25.98]Good.
[193:29.62]This guy's holding a foam bat.
[193:31.46]That's not going to hurt anyone.
[193:38.88]we rescued this guy excuse me what are you doing you're doing parkour no the guy that we rescued is watching wait is he trying to fight you yes I don't know what happened he's keeper rescued he's mad wait is he mad I think he's he gave up alright take his head off
[194:13.44]Take his head.
[194:16.92]We're doing, like, no damage to him.
[194:18.22]Why can't we hurt him?
[194:19.68]I think you might have to, like, parry these guys to get their helmet off.
[194:31.49]He's got a black eye.
[194:35.25]After all that, he has a shiner.
[194:36.65]He's got a black eye.
[194:38.65]I'm...
[194:45.29]Just leave him.
[194:47.08]He's not worth our time.
[194:49.38]Here.
[194:50.16]Take some money.
[194:57.26]Are we climbing this?
[194:59.20]I like climbing.
[194:59.86]Where are we going?
[195:03.55]He's following you.
[195:07.45]We're going this way.
[195:08.01]Follow me.
[195:08.53]He's picking up rocks and throwing them at us.
[195:11.29]Yeah, he doesn't like us.
[195:12.22]Let's go.
[195:13.04]Hey, another cop car.
[195:14.94]There's definitely nothing in there.
[195:16.38]Let's go.
[195:18.50]You want to stick to the roofs?
[195:28.01]Generally, you want to stick to the rooftops in this game.
[195:30.43]Okay.
[195:31.09]Who has the goofy horn?
[195:33.85]I'm not hearing a horn.
[195:34.73]You don't?
[195:35.07]Am I going crazy?
[195:36.03]You don't hear a goofy horn?
[195:37.84]I don't hear a or anything.
[195:42.99]in that building I shouldn't have I'll lock that I need to lock that guy oh you're too far away I guess I'll just do it and you'll be like right here irrelevant no you're kind of far right here right now watch out where's the lock I there was this door I opened it there's nothing in here
[196:17.83]There's a question mark over here.
[196:19.67]I want to go see the question mark.
[196:22.27]That was dumb.
[196:24.85]Jumping off the roof.
[196:25.67]Oh, you did it too?
[196:27.09]I've made it, I guess.
[196:34.86]I need to craft heals.
[196:39.50]Apparently, we're supposed to come back at night.
[196:43.33]I'm back at night.
[196:45.59]Okay, I don't... It's a dark zone.
[196:50.77]I don't know.
[196:52.09]Ooh, I can unlock Far Jump.
[196:58.26]Or Running Speed.
[196:59.04]I'll do Far Jump.
[197:05.28]When do you get to cast Fireball?
[197:09.03]I seriously haven't... We've leveled up one time.
[197:12.97]Does that just mean we're not doing anything?
[197:15.47]Maybe.
[197:15.99]Or we didn't get like the pre-order EXP boost or something.
[197:24.07]That's what it must be.
[197:27.92]About the halftime show?
[197:30.26]I don't... What do you want me to say about it?
[197:32.12]I don't... I'm not watching it.
[197:37.90]Can you please react?
[197:44.47]We have to actually go find honey.
[197:48.05]Pretty sure we can like go to a place and buy it.
[197:52.03]Yeah, I'm out of healing again.
[197:55.24]Are you kidding me?
[197:57.68]I fell at that last second there.
[198:02.38]React.
[198:04.36]No, I'm not reacting to the Super Bowl halftime show.
[198:09.36]Who's performing?
[198:10.77]I don't know.
[198:12.11]I can react to that.
[198:14.48]Is it fucking Barney again?
[198:19.12]Barney comes on stage and they do like a whole routine with him?
[198:22.20]Yeah, last year it was Barney and Baby Bob.
[198:29.38]I actually would watch that.
[198:32.35]That was the halftime show.
[198:34.25]Why do so many NPCs have this hair?
[198:36.79]Because we keep coming back and talking to the same guy.
[198:48.10]It's not a different person.
[198:49.68]What are you talking about?
[198:56.18]That hair is... Why do I feel like that hairstyle is always selectable in any game that has character customization?
[199:04.97]The just bizarre buzz cut in the wrong spots.
[199:08.69]It's always like number... It's only the second row.
[199:11.44]Always.
[199:12.60]We gotta rescue this guy.
[199:18.28]Yeah, when dropping onto enemies from above... He's like, what the fuck just happened?
[199:22.96]He's like, holy shit.

[200:27.70]Shut up!
[200:37.07]Alright, let's help this guy.
[200:40.67]Who are all these homeless people that come off the street like, oh, there's a fight going on.
[200:44.39]I'm coming in.
[200:45.85]We got him.
[200:49.01]Holy shit, this guy's good.
[200:50.65]Who is this guy?
[200:51.63]I'm doing a 1v1.
[200:59.48]Why does this guy have a trophy?
[201:14.80]Okay.
[201:16.12]There's zombies coming.
[201:18.16]I have no healing.
[201:19.36]No, no.
[201:20.94]Oh, what the fuck, dude?
[201:25.08]I've had enough.
[201:25.64]We gotta go.
[201:32.89]Get me out.
[201:33.63]Get me out before I kill him.
[201:36.05]He has a trophy on him.
[201:37.47]Let's finish saving him.
[201:43.37]He's in danger.
[201:44.97]Okay.
[201:47.31]Does he, like, talk to us?
[201:50.49]Oh, yeah.
[201:50.89]I could, like, take it from him.
[201:52.29]Take the trophy from him?
[201:53.09]Okay, get it.
[201:54.51]I got it.
[201:55.62]How do I get it?
[201:56.70]I can't take anything.
[201:57.28]That probably hurts so bad.
[202:00.30]Alright, here.
[202:03.44]Thanks for the help.
[202:09.74]Okay, let's go.
[202:11.26]Okay, let's go.
[202:11.76]Rooftops, we're in trouble.
[202:15.35]Are we?
[202:16.35]I don't feel threatened.
[202:17.47]Somebody just called me Original Sin Andy.
[202:30.24]Well, like, I haven't been baptized?
[202:33.20]What the fuck is that message?
[202:34.82]What is that comment?
[202:36.48]Divinity Original Sin?
[202:38.40]Good game.
[202:41.86]This guy's got a fruit.
[202:46.93]Okay.
[202:51.55]Can we eat those?
[202:58.37]What did you do?
[202:59.73]I threw a coin at his head.
[203:03.56]He's on the run.
[203:04.54]He's running.
[203:05.04]Running for his life.
[203:10.47]He's guilty of something.
[203:11.43]He was just eating an apple.
[203:17.35]He didn't even do anything.
[203:18.21]You're a dick.
[203:19.65]Alright.
[203:19.85]Quest is this way.
[203:25.57]Let's go.
[203:25.79]You got to stop fooling around.
[203:30.05]How are we ever going to get the antidote?
[203:32.39]Oh, wait.
[203:32.73]Nighttime.
[203:33.07]Let's go in here.
[203:33.61]This was the place.
[203:34.75]Oh, that's right.
[203:35.31]You're right.
[203:36.57]Watch out.
[203:36.87]There's a scorcher.
[203:41.86]I'd be careful in here.
[203:43.64]Oh, there's one right there.
[203:45.84]You don't want to alert him.
[203:50.87]You wouldn't want to start playing the sound machine right now.
[203:54.07]I think one person.
[203:57.18]No.
[204:04.62]Oh, there's one more.
[204:05.52]Sorry, I got it wrong.
[204:06.70]One more person.
[204:08.94]My zombie powers are showing that there's a lot of enemies in here.
[204:16.53]Some of them in coats, some of them in pants.
[204:21.04]I'm not seeing it I'm I'm like an 800 on my experience here are you actually okay I feel like I'm starting to see a lot of the game and it's uh I've seen a lot of the same you know so I feel like my experience meter is actually going up so you're how far are you at the uh 800 out of a thousand I'll say 823 nice round number you know I'll be honest I'm probably getting kind of close too to being able to say that as well
[204:50.50]Blades.
[205:00.95]Got to be people.
[205:01.51]Lock that guy.
[205:02.47]Lock that guy.
[205:05.01]We got some big loot in here.
[205:06.15]This is odd.
[205:12.50]I know where it is.
[205:13.08]Don't worry.
[205:19.64]What happened?
[205:21.94]You fell over.
[205:25.59]You're a bit silly.
[205:26.15]You're doing some ditzy stuff.
[205:32.65]Oh, you fuck.
[205:35.19]It's right there.
[205:36.00]A little bit more.
[205:37.40]Got it.
[205:41.04]Ooh.
[205:43.22]Urgent.
[205:45.84]So, uh...
[205:50.61]Remember how in the last game you just carried UV lights around with you, and then the zombies went, I think you can.
[205:55.98]You can make them.
[205:58.10]Oh, can you?
[205:58.92]That makes a lot of sense.
[206:00.60]I feel like everyone should just be covered in UV lights like a RGB keyboard kind of situation.
[206:07.86]This whole thing wouldn't really be a problem anymore.
[206:09.82]Why are we getting intense music?
[206:13.88]I'm not.
[206:15.95]Oh my, I'm about to die.
[206:18.33]Why?
[206:22.18]There's a UV flashlight in a later mission.
[206:24.04]That's cool.
[206:27.40]That's all it was.
[206:28.14]Let's go.
[206:32.64]We actually could both die very soon here.
[206:41.29]You guys are in the baby zone still because you're not doing any story missions.
[206:46.15]We're stuck in the baby zone.
[206:49.57]What?
[206:51.03]You ran that fast?
[206:59.06]We've been helping though.
[207:00.32]We've been doing it.
[207:01.78]I'm going to go to the craft master.
[207:04.94]I need you all players.
[207:08.16]I can't talk to this guy unless you got my back.
[207:10.82]I'm anxious.
[207:13.20]It's a skyscraper city that you haven't even gotten to.
[207:16.25]You're not even going to get to it.
[207:22.44]Shove him up your ass.
[207:33.70]Okay.
[207:38.11]That was a side quest.
[207:40.13]We got to do some main story missions.
[207:43.53]I mean, I learned a parkour point.
[207:47.76]Okay, so this only... Get some work at the bazaar and earn Sophie's trust.
[207:51.74]Isn't that what we just did?
[207:52.60]Yeah, I guess she still doesn't trust us.
[207:58.64]Yeah, she doesn't trust us.
[208:04.99]Perfect dodge.
[208:09.95]Okay.
[208:12.71]Perfect dodge will stagger an enemy.
[208:14.03]That's cool.
[208:24.96]I'm going to go to the crafting zone.
[208:31.84]I just purchase things.
[208:33.36]I'm never going to use them.
[208:35.56]If someone's going to tell me to use them, I'm never going to do it.
[208:39.10]I want to craft.
[208:44.90]Oh, it's middle mouse button to upgrade your blueprints.
[208:49.59]By the way.
[208:55.39]Oh, cool.
[208:55.89]I crafted.
[208:57.81]I did it.
[208:58.21]I crafted.
[209:03.38]I did it.
[209:03.78]I figured it out.
[209:04.64]Cool.
[209:05.34]Alright.
[209:05.98]So I just got that better.
[209:08.20]Yeah.
[209:09.22]Yeah.
[209:09.62]You did get that better.
[209:10.34]It's so hot in this room.
[209:10.98]I got to turn my fan on.
[209:18.39]Fully endured.
[209:20.19]Like a million degrees in here.
[209:22.03]Oh, who's selling the healing items?
[209:25.41]Anyone got any healing items in here?
[209:29.95]Somebody probably does.
[209:35.58]It's the General Shop I think has them.
[209:39.38]This fucking loser is selling cans.
[209:45.50]Oh, these are nice.
[209:49.21]Get a job.
[209:52.74]Glasses?
[209:53.14]Yeah, just buy all the heals.
[210:00.43]I did.
[210:01.45]I've purchased a full stack of healing items.
[210:08.87]Tell all the bullshit that all the weapons you're not using either.
[210:11.07]I gotta say, I'm feeling ready to take on the world.
[210:19.49]This thing's pretty good.
[210:20.91]Antique hammer?
[210:21.51]I'm going to actually do a pee-pee while you do your shopping.
[210:25.11]Oh, we're going to do a break?
[210:27.43]If you want to do a pee-pee, or if you want to, like, go pee into the toilet or whatever.
[210:32.84]Let's go pee.
[210:34.66]We'll be right back.
[210:36.02]Yeah, let's make sure we flush at the same time.
[210:37.46]Sink it.
[210:37.96]Okay.
[210:38.08]We'll be right back.
[210:39.36]See you in a minute.
[214:28.73]Hello, I am back.
[214:31.27]I don't think Ster is, though.
[214:32.75]We'll find out.
[214:37.36]Are you back?
[214:39.12]Oh, yeah, I'm back.
[214:40.04]Alright.
[214:40.90]My Warhammer, electricity going through it the whole way.
[214:48.84]electricity you say huh yeah electricity very cool it's a little bit more practical than just finding a handgun so I wired up my metal hammer with electricity and how did you do that um when you press I and you go in your inventory and you click on your weapon yeah
[215:11.29]um I can't remember oh press modify weapon to modify yeah and if you have the blueprints and the equipment then you can I don't I think I sold everything uh someone in here sells blueprints for weapons or was that other place we were at they were selling a lot of weapon blueprints but yeah this guy has like weapon mods for the shaft you want like a different shaft weapon hmm
[215:34.98]Oh.
[215:35.60]He's got some flame tips.
[215:36.92]Toxic.
[215:37.52]Fire.
[215:40.25]I think I want the toxic.
[215:42.75]And the fire.
[215:43.29]I want them both.
[215:45.07]Yeah.
[215:48.41]Yeah, definitely.
[215:49.31]Nice.
[215:50.69]Okay, now we go to the weapon.
[215:52.89]Wait, that's not the weapon I want.
[215:53.91]I want to put it on this.
[215:57.43]Let's go ahead and put... Where's my blueprints?
[216:05.22]I just bought them.
[216:05.64]Where are they?
[216:10.06]Didn't I buy them?
[216:12.44]Those tips might have been for arrows.
[216:16.63]Didn't I just buy blueprints?
[216:17.67]Where do they go?
[216:20.19]When you go to modify your weapon, that's where they show up.
[216:23.71]That was a shaft mod?
[216:25.79]Yeah.
[216:27.73]It's toxic to one... Okay.
[216:32.72]A tip mod.
[216:33.30]How do I...
[216:35.19]You press C on the weapon and then the top one is a tip.
[216:38.75]And then there's a shaft and there's a charm.
[216:40.57]If you want to put a charm on it.
[216:42.07]But we don't have charms.
[216:42.97]You got to do a tip.
[216:45.09]I get you.
[216:46.55]So I can put like a flaming tip at the top of my shaft.
[216:50.52]My venom shaft.
[216:51.40]I'm going to put fire on it.
[216:53.86]On the shaft.
[216:56.08]Okay.
[216:56.28]Yeah.
[216:56.44]I've got a flaming weapon and a shaft.
[216:59.01]Cool.
[216:59.83]This is cool.
[217:00.77]Yeah.
[217:01.09]Okay.
[217:02.01]You ready?
[217:03.03]Yeah.
[217:05.59]I'm healing.
[217:06.61]Okay.
[217:10.77]So what story mission are we on now?
[217:12.91]Get some work at the Bazaar and earn some... Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[217:16.77]Let me see if I have other quests.
[217:33.22]See, I thought that was part of the main one.
[217:35.26]Get some work.
[217:37.80]I thought we just did work, though.
[217:39.24]Do we have to keep doing side missions?
[217:40.95]We might have to do another.
[217:44.43]Get some work.
[217:45.05]Is there anybody else that has a job in here?
[217:50.13]Journal?
[217:51.45]Yeah, story quest.
[217:53.35]The only way out.
[217:54.72]That's what we're doing, right?
[217:56.24]I think so.
[217:57.36]I mean, there's a person over here.
[218:01.63]All players required to talk to this lady.
[218:03.81]Yep, we gotta keep doing these.
[218:12.45]Coming, gas can.
[218:13.24]I'm sorry.
[218:14.50]This might be nothing.
[218:15.30]I don't know.
[218:21.80]Oh, Bevan.
[218:23.12]Bevan.
[218:23.40]Should've known he'd try to get back at us.
[218:25.24]I guessed it.
[218:27.24]Did we do it?
[218:28.38]Yeah, I think we did it.
[218:29.72]I want to be alone.
[218:31.67]What?
[218:31.89]We didn't do it.
[218:35.81]Is anyone need any work?
[218:41.17]Anybody have anything to do?
[218:43.27]Anyone have any work for us?
[218:46.43]Anyone you need?
[218:47.76]Hey, all players.
[218:48.46]Hey, this guy needs some work.

[219:29.30]Hey, this guy.
[219:31.30]Please wait.
[219:32.14]It still says please wait.
[219:35.71]Look in your side quests for ones that say bizarre.
[219:39.07]Yeah, we might already have... Yeah, I probably already accepted them.
[219:42.27]Did you already take one?
[219:43.71]I took a bunch before the stream started.
[219:48.20]Side quest.
[219:48.88]Cheers.
[219:49.60]Yeah, it's saying these are side quests.
[219:51.60]Return to Carlos.
[219:53.24]Current objective, report to the...
[219:56.58]Oh, I have to track it.
[219:57.80]I think they're all here.
[219:59.56]They're all in front of us.
[220:03.23]Skips all dialog.
[220:04.69]I'm confused, bro.
[220:06.17]Yeah, that's the joke.
[220:08.27]You got it.
[220:08.99]Yeah, the guy in chat, he got the joke.
[220:12.45]We can't talk to this guy.
[220:14.41]He's too popular.
[220:16.34]We need to turn the quest into him and we can't.
[220:20.10]I'm confused.
[220:20.86]Is that okay?
[220:22.32]Are we sure he's not above us?
[220:24.08]No, he's over his head.
[220:28.96]Okay, well, is there another one?
[220:29.90]Uh, I mean, we did that quest.
[220:33.24]I feel like I deserve credit for it.
[220:38.48]Who else has a turn in?
[220:40.02]Ah, Bebin.
[220:40.68]Okay, let me look at what else.
[220:42.84]We can do a different one.
[220:44.52]Bebin?
[220:47.40]We'll bring Lavender.
[220:48.94]Oh, we can apparently... Well, those are... Everything else is further away.
[220:55.67]That guy...
[221:00.56]I don't think we can talk to this guy.
[221:03.40]OK, let's go do this then we can come back later when he decides to work.
[221:06.94]Wait, are you still pointing me to what the?
[221:11.33]It's doing this.
[221:12.95]I know there's someone out back.
[221:16.87]Go to the main menu and then go back in.
[221:18.27]No, don't do it.
[221:20.09]OK, it's honestly just cam.
[221:22.75]Well, this is right here.
[221:26.44]No.
[221:29.08]Let's run 100 meters.
[221:32.35]We're runners.
[221:32.89]That's our job.
[221:42.48]It's nighttime.
[221:43.04]It's scary.
[221:44.44]I'm honestly not afraid of the dark.
[221:46.10]There's two random quests here.
[221:58.37]main quest Jerma that's right yep yep yep yep thank you thanks for correcting me there all players let's go hello what do you wait I'm confused what did I agree to I don't know what just happened didn't you hear what I said get downstairs
[222:26.73]Oh, didn't you hear what I said?
[222:27.71]Get downstairs.
[222:29.17]See, they know.
[222:35.39]This isn't a main quest.
[222:39.42]But we can't do the main quest until we do all the side quests here.
[222:41.52]Lion, say I'm a local.
[222:54.21]Yeah, I'm a local.
[222:55.23]Born and bred, if you must know.
[222:57.87]Then why haven't I ever seen you before?
[223:00.61]Couldn't say.
[223:01.71]We're tightly packed, but it's still a big city.
[223:04.68]This game makes no fucking sense.
[223:06.64]It does.
[223:07.10]We're just skipping every dialog piece.
[223:11.32]Double down.
[223:14.56]The story is probably interesting.
[223:17.03]I don't know.
[223:17.63]It could be.
[223:20.13]That's another thing.
[223:21.96]Heard a fellow almost got lynched at the bazaar.
[223:25.24]Didn't have a marker.
[223:27.00]Some say he was recently infected.
[223:29.89]Ring a bell?
[223:30.45]What are they talking about us?
[223:33.39]I double down.
[223:34.75]I saw that guy.
[223:35.89]He was taken outside by Hakon and killed.
[223:39.81]Maybe he was.
[223:41.95]Or maybe he will be.
[223:43.61]Because he's sitting here lying to my face.
[223:46.16]You know what they need to put into games for idiots like us?
[223:49.60]What?
[223:51.01]Like an audio tape you can play that's five minutes long that plays while you're playing that tells you the whole story.
[223:58.29]We wouldn't listen to it.
[223:59.81]You don't think so?
[224:01.93]No.
[224:03.01]Okay.
[224:05.03]And a lot of games do that.
[224:06.15]Like when you're the Master Chief and you have the little blue girl telling you... Do you think we would skip that if it was like, oh, hey, for the people... We're fighting these guys.
[224:16.50]Yeah, we're fighting them.
[224:17.34]Did it matter...
[224:21.43]Oh my god, I threw a spear in that guy's head.
[224:26.75]Wait, the guy lit on fire?
[224:28.93]Yeah, you got a fire weapon?
[224:30.13]I got a lightning weapon.
[224:30.69]Oh, that's right.
[224:31.05]This is awesome!
[224:33.48]Oh, they got more goons.
[224:35.22]That was the main guy.
[224:36.22]He's already dead.
[224:41.62]Wow, our weapons are dealing damage.
[224:49.18]You get that guy.
[224:50.00]A roadie vest.
[224:50.88]Okay, let's go.
[224:53.90]A bit of a roadie.
[225:01.15]This thing is awesome.
[225:05.67]This is Fallout for people that don't want to play Fallout.
[225:11.93]I mean, it's not a mid-time.
[225:13.58]It's... Our business strategy.
[225:15.40]We heard there's a lot of people out there that don't want to play Fallout.
[225:17.72]So, we're going to make Fallout.
[225:23.10]Okay.
[225:23.42]Board meeting approved.
[225:24.16]Here's your budget.
[225:34.10]I can't even.
[225:35.12]I can't.
[225:35.60]Oh, I wonder who this person is.
[225:38.94]What?
[225:39.36]What?
[225:43.40]I should tell Carl this.
[225:45.86]Maybe Carl knows.
[225:46.94]No, wait, don't.
[225:47.84]You don't think if, like, the little Microsoft paperclip guy was in the corner, like, so this is Damien, and he's one of those players that you come across.
[225:56.05]He's Michael's son, like, just for us to know.
[225:59.69]Wait, I got, like, choices.
[226:00.81]Do I want to help him?
[226:02.55]That sounds like a side quest.
[226:04.65]Be careful.
[226:05.29]He's a swindler.
[226:06.33]Like, and then the paperclip disappears.
[226:08.22]Hey, this is Sophie.
[226:11.44]Let's talk now.
[226:14.11]Why do you keep doing that to me?
[226:15.77]Because you were very hurt, and I worry.
[226:17.59]That wouldn't be immersive.
[226:19.79]No, but it's something you could turn off and on.
[226:21.37]Oh, so we're arguing against accessibility now.
[226:26.07]No, I said you could turn it off and on.
[226:27.56]It's off and on.
[226:28.04]That's what I'm saying.
[226:28.74]I'm saying the chatter, like, oh, you don't want to go there.
[226:31.38]Remember, it was the one guy that liked Clippy.
[226:36.80]Ooh, look down there.
[226:37.70]Oh, is that Zed's?
[226:44.60]You want to do something about this?
[226:45.56]You want to defeat?
[226:46.38]It does say defeat.
[226:47.32]It does say defeat.
[226:48.94]Like that's a little clippy telling us defeat.
[226:50.88]Do we have any bombs or anything?
[226:53.63]I don't have any bombs or anything.
[226:54.93]Alright.
[226:55.15]Well, let's just go.
[226:56.19]We got cool elemental weapons.
[226:58.55]You want to do a drop?
[226:59.25]Oh, there's a spear up here.
[227:00.17]Nice.
[227:01.45]Good start.
[227:05.96]We can double spear.
[227:09.47]One, two, three.
[227:12.05]Did we both miss?
[227:13.95]No, I threw it already.
[227:16.27]I hit him.
[227:20.43]Okay.
[227:22.46]Careful.
[227:26.02]He's on fire.
[227:37.97]Nice.
[227:40.41]Don't you dare.
[227:46.60]Don't you dare.
[227:47.52]He's dead.
[227:51.42]Trophy.
[227:55.14]Oh, that was cool.
[227:55.84]Nice.
[227:59.94]Perfume.
[228:04.37]It's very weird how that just happened, but I'll take it.
[228:10.99]Yeah, I finally unlocked power attack.
[228:15.53]Seems kind of, uh... You got power attack?
[228:17.67]I got power attack, yeah.
[228:18.87]Okay, so let's keep moving.
[228:24.97]Is someone ringing a bell?
[228:32.26]A toll of the undead.
[228:36.08]That is in every game, isn't it?
[228:39.06]Oh, the toll of the dead.
[228:40.96]You're saying bells are overdone.
[228:47.10]I think they're in everything.
[228:48.44]I think like the church bells symbolizes the undead.
[228:53.33]Yeah.
[228:56.15]What happened?
[228:58.87]What happened?
[229:00.05]I got kicked out.
[229:01.99]Oh, you said you left my session and then I dropped my weapon.
[229:06.11]Did you get kicked out?
[229:07.46]No, I'm still in here.
[229:08.94]What?
[229:11.72]Can you re-invite me?
[229:13.85]Help.
[229:16.43]Try and re-invite.
[229:19.47]Are you online on Steam?
[229:21.67]I should be.
[229:23.75]What's that all about?
[229:29.63]Robo Yerma?
[229:31.14]He sounds normal to me.
[229:32.12]Wait, did my stream die?
[229:36.84]Weird.
[229:38.98]Oh, well, whatever.
[229:43.92]It was me.
[229:44.60]Oh, shit.
[229:45.34]I guess my internet F'd for a second.
[229:47.68]Do I sound weird?
[229:49.66]A little bit, yeah.
[229:52.74]Are you back?
[229:53.12]Yeah, you're back.
[229:53.70]I think I'm back.
[229:54.22]I think it was just a little chunky F. It's okay.
[230:02.67]Can you pull me to where you are?
[230:04.55]I can't.
[230:05.81]I mean, maybe if I go to this NPC, I can.
[230:13.17]Yeah, that one counted because now Sophie wants to talk to us because we did the side quest.
[230:17.26]Oh, good.
[230:18.88]We just had to do one side quest.
[230:22.30]We've been running around for hours.
[230:26.58]Hey, she hasn't even got her trust.
[230:29.11]Okay, fast travel.
[230:31.75]Teleporting to a leader in nine seconds.
[230:33.41]Why can't I just do it now?
[230:34.89]Yeah, can you please call me leader?
[230:38.07]Am I still dropping frames?
[230:45.03]No?
[230:45.33]Okay.
[230:46.51]How many people are streaming the Super Bowl?
[230:48.93]Yeah, don't you have no fiber?
[230:51.51]I do have fiber, yes.
[230:52.07]Waiting for other players before proceeding.
[230:54.35]Okay.
[230:54.51]Now I am.
[230:54.85]It's probably just a little bump.
[230:56.57]It happens sometimes.
[231:15.43]I do have gigabit connection.
[231:16.72]I have fiber.
[231:18.84]It's very rare.
[231:20.20]Very rare that this happens.
[231:21.86]Oh, it'll pass.
[231:26.35]It'll be good.
[232:13.58]Well, let's see if I come back.
[232:18.42]Weird.
[232:21.04]I'm back.
[232:21.42]Yeah, guys, I just did a speed test.
[232:23.57]I'm at 1,000, 1,000.
[232:25.57]I'm at full connection.
[232:26.91]It looks like something weird is going on.
[232:29.51]But we'll try this again.
[232:31.95]I mean, maybe the Super Bowl is shutting down everything.
[232:34.66]Maybe the Super Bowl is so crazy that nothing else is going to work for years.
[232:39.72]Maybe it's the Twitch server.
[232:40.60]I don't think it's the Twitch server because I wouldn't be dropping from the game, too.
[232:49.50]Thanks for the invite.
[232:50.20]Hey, no problem.
[232:56.34]Yeah, I wouldn't be dropping out of the game.
[233:00.54]But weirdly, I'm not dropping out of the call.
[233:05.20]That's kind of weird.
[233:06.56]Well, you're not even like, actually, I think you did drop out of the call for a little bit when you disconnected.
[233:14.91]I couldn't hear you for a moment.
[233:18.79]It's probably still happening.
[233:26.99]Am I still here?
[233:28.51]Yeah.
[233:29.39]Okay.
[233:29.73]Well, let's just try it.
[233:30.86]Let's just go.
[233:31.78]I'll teleport you to me.
[233:35.50]Phi, brr, omega, LOL, brr, omega, LOL, whatever.
[233:39.22]Yeah, how much do you pay a month?
[233:40.52]Like $7,000 for this internet?
[233:42.76]Actually, actually way less than I was paying before for, like, cable internet.
[233:48.74]Yeah, I bet.
[233:56.24]Banana bro here.
[233:57.46]Ditch that loser stream.
[233:58.78]What does Ster call you guys here?
[234:00.21]The pineapple people?
[234:02.47]No, come back to my stream.
[234:04.43]Come back to my stream.
[234:05.33]Don't go straight away.
[234:06.73]Hey, welcome to the Sturmata.
[234:10.18]It's like an armada, but like, you know, let's hit 100,000 likes and show how strong we are.
[234:15.59]The star motto is coming into the solar system.
[234:18.33]That's actually pretty cool.
[234:19.21]I would probably sub.
[234:19.97]Alright, get over here.
[234:23.95]Said no one ever.
[234:25.25]Wait, where are you?
[234:31.26]I'm at the quest.
[234:32.90]Oh, I was spacing out.
[234:35.46]I was reading.
[234:38.11]Sturmata.
[234:40.07]One of the, uh, Jerma's group of inhumane psychopaths?
[234:44.83]No, the Jermamites.
[234:48.85]You gotta get it right.
[234:49.85]The Jermamites.
[234:53.46]What did you find?
[234:55.10]I know the location, but I always told your brother I... So that... No.
[234:59.32]If I told you... Wait.
[235:01.92]Never mind.
[235:03.30]How did Barney get hurt?
[235:04.60]What happened at the Super Bowl halftime show?
[235:05.92]Did he, like, break his... Like, sprain his ankle?
[235:09.57]Oh, no, not another Barney Nip slip.
[235:18.01]Wait, wait, after.
[235:19.89]While exploring the city, you'll come across characters marked with the night.
[235:23.07]OK.
[235:27.07]And then you hold T to fast forward to night.
[235:31.40]So, I think it's that thing, that gas station we were at?
[235:34.32]Remember, it's like, come back at night time.
[235:35.56]Yeah, yeah.
[235:36.66]Okay, it's giving us one of those missions now.
[235:38.14]We can do a hold T, I think.
[235:41.36]We gotta go.
[235:42.80]Oh, is it now gonna be night?
[235:43.58]Somebody said, is the Super Bowl why Twitter is lagging?
[235:53.73]I don't know.
[235:54.07]Dude, do you remember that, like, there was a horrible, horrible day not that long ago?
[235:58.83]Like, I was panicked.
[236:00.60]um you probably like have your own story like where you were on that day uh when Facebook was down hmm no I don't didn't Facebook just say that like they're gonna pull all operations out of Europe like if they don't like if they can't do advertising or something
[236:29.24]Can you imagine if Facebook just was like, yeah, we're not in Europe anymore.
[236:32.82]That was a bluff.
[236:34.39]I don't know.
[236:35.53]I've read that.
[236:36.13]I mean, someone would immediately take their place.
[236:40.89]They would be, um... I don't know.
[236:41.69]Yeah, I don't... I don't know about all that.
[236:43.67]I have no opinions.
[236:54.05]I feel like opinions are, like, kind of cringe.
[236:56.75]Somebody's talking.
[236:58.25]Like, robbing somebody.
[237:00.39]Yeah, I'm interested in the main quest.
[237:03.29]They bluffed.
[237:03.83]They got called out.
[237:04.71]Uh-oh.
[237:15.29]Am I lagging again?
[237:18.27]Are you?
[237:19.88]Oh, you like just disappeared.
[237:22.30]Uh, hello.
[237:23.04]Hello.
[237:23.54]Am I still here?
[237:24.94]Uh, hello.
[237:25.24]Are you still here?
[237:26.80]Ow.
[237:27.72]I'm good.
[237:31.50]Did you turn on the streamer DMCA mode?
[237:34.19]I did actually.
[237:35.61]Pretty cool.
[237:36.19]Do you know DMCA isn't real?
[237:37.95]I know you already went over this.
[237:38.93]You already talked a bunch of shit about this.
[237:40.55]Okay.
[237:41.03]I just want to make sure you're in the know because if you're not, then you look like a fool.
[237:44.59]What happened?
[237:45.33]What happened to this guy?
[237:48.48]Can we actually find out?
[237:49.30]Do you want to help him?
[237:51.42]We're kind of tripping.
[237:53.24]Yes, let's help him.
[237:54.64]I'll do what I can.
[237:56.33]Don't skip this.
[237:57.65]I'll do what I can.
[238:05.13]Okay.
[238:05.67]He's gone.
[238:06.23]Was he a ghost?
[238:06.87]Was he not real?
[238:09.05]Where is he?
[238:14.28]That's weird.
[238:16.42]We have two things to do.
[238:18.36]Do we go over there?
[238:20.04]Climb the windmill and restore power.
[238:23.10]Or... Search for Barney.
[238:27.12]Let's turn the power on.
[238:27.82]That was like the choice quest we had.
[238:29.20]Uh, okay.
[238:33.01]There's a container.
[238:35.03]Uh, okay.
[238:36.91]I know.
[238:37.49]Main story, main story, main story.
[238:38.65]But it's fun to walk around and get stuff.
[238:41.57]Okay.
[238:42.92]Am I lagging?
[238:43.46]Is that you making a joke?
[238:44.34]Yeah, I'm making fun of you.
[238:46.44]You're kind of roboting again.
[238:47.94]What?
[238:53.00]Wait, what?
[238:55.33]It's in here somewhere.
[238:55.93]Is it on the roof?
[239:05.73]There's a one and a two.
[239:06.65]I'm at the one.
[239:10.91]It wants me to climb up top.
[239:17.54]And I didn't get the one cycle.
[239:21.16]And every moment that you're not talking, I feel like you disconnected.
[239:23.59]Oh, I'm still here.
[239:24.19]I'm here.
[239:24.39]I'm here.
[239:25.31]Okay.
[239:25.83]Like, I'm worried about you.
[239:27.75]I found the thing.
[239:29.85]I found the thing.
[239:31.99]I'm doing a different thing.
[239:34.38]And I'm already, like, partway through.
[239:35.68]I feel like my thing takes precedence.
[239:37.78]I mean, can I loot this and do you get the credit for it?
[239:41.51]I don't know.
[239:41.81]Find out.
[239:44.78]Oh, dude, you're going to want to come over here.
[239:46.72]This is a neck guitar.
[239:48.68]Okay, I'm coming.
[239:50.44]There actually is one of those.
[239:51.34]There's an inhibitor.
[239:52.14]Okay, teleporting to you.
[240:09.87]It does kind of look like that.
[240:14.57]Oh, we did it.
[240:15.03]We built a whole settlement.
[240:17.34]Everyone's moving in.
[240:18.66]Don't do that right next to your thigh.
[240:20.62]Oh my god, that was dangerous.
[240:23.68]They don't know any better.
[240:33.46]Somebody said iPad ad commercial.
[240:37.45]It does feel like that.
[240:42.65]Okay.
[240:43.41]Cool.
[240:44.71]There's a glider and a grappling hook in this game.
[240:56.40]And at this pace, you're never going to see it.
[241:01.21]Look at how pretty that is.
[241:03.11]So the bitrate can catch up.
[241:04.41]Just I'm not going to move.
[241:05.41]But damn.
[241:13.24]Yeah, I'm going to use my glider right now.
[241:17.36]We're doing it at our own pace.
[241:19.08]We don't have to be super gamers about it.
[241:20.40]We're just enjoying the time.
[241:25.76]Yeah, the speedrun already finished this game by now.
[241:29.86]We should just give up.
[241:36.04]yeah I'm giving oh my god there's so many zams what happened to the guy that was like help me and we're all on drugs while we shook his hand I don't he wasn't real oh my god what do you mean you're right I'm running oh you're in I thought you were okay
[242:10.95]Here, keep clinging.
[242:11.51]I'll heal.
[242:12.41]Keep clinging.
[242:13.75]I have no stamina.
[242:20.17]I'll heal you.
[242:20.65]I'll do it to you.
[242:24.69]Got ya.
[242:27.27]I'm electrified.
[242:28.18]The most electrifying man in... Oh, wait.
[242:32.68]I have one of these.
[242:36.04]Do it.
[242:36.36]Whoa.
[242:37.10]Whoa.
[242:46.55]nice wow okay we got a lot of looting to do players required a lot of loot investigation yeah I feel like we've done that a hundred times I know I feel like there was a whole tutorial I think we did that already
[243:14.99]Oh shit.
[243:15.87]Wait, how do we do this investigation?
[243:17.11]There's like footprints here.
[243:18.65]We just have to follow the footprints.
[243:20.87]What?
[243:21.49]Where are they going?
[243:22.79]We'll find out.
[243:26.36]Sophie, I found blood.
[243:28.30]It's fresh.
[243:28.82]What am I doing?
[243:29.56]Hurry, Aiden.
[243:31.04]Did you just eat that?
[243:31.72]There's a crystal in here.
[243:35.00]Power crystal.
[243:36.46]Really?
[243:37.68]Yeah.
[243:39.18]You said you found an inhibitor in here earlier?
[243:41.14]No, it was backed up.
[243:43.18]Um.
[243:45.16]If you said that you'd give me a million dollars if I could show you where that was, I wouldn't be able to do it.
[243:49.80]Okay, well, I'm not going to.
[243:53.60]I have no idea where that was.
[243:54.72]It was like 40 meters right.
[244:00.35]I'm just looting.
[244:01.89]Okay, the blood goes this way.
[244:02.91]I think we're getting these crystals.
[244:09.47]We're smashing open these crystals.
[244:11.25]We're doing a little bit of mining.
[244:12.23]They go up the stairs too, by the way.
[244:21.61]Oh yeah, you can sell these, can't you?
[244:24.33]The guy, I remember them in the tutorial.
[244:25.71]He's like, these go for a lot.

[254:00.30]Lucas is gone.
[254:01.34]She's patching up his eye.
[254:04.30]It'd be better if you just shut up.
[254:05.72]His same eye.
[254:06.64]It's going to be the eye.
[254:08.22]No.
[254:09.87]Oh.

[258:31.94]Okay.
[258:32.48]Well, okay.
[258:33.88]I'm just remembering from the thing that we did with the stuff and, you know, the place.
[258:38.56]We had an M&M McFlurry?
[258:41.38]No, one of the Jerma contestants said a nice one.
[258:45.40]Oh, oh, oh.
[258:45.93]You said that was a good order, and I was like, oh, are you also an M&M McFlurry guy?
[258:49.97]Oh, okay, okay.
[258:53.31]Anyways.
[258:53.63]A different Jerma.
[258:54.55]Sorry, different Jerma.
[258:55.63]Well, there's always been me.
[258:56.91]I'm the only one that's been here.
[258:58.73]Yeah, I know.
[259:00.94]But we were going to replace you.
[259:02.28]Like, we had that thing going, and, like, I'm glad that we ended up not doing it.
[259:06.12]No, because that would be, like, weird.
[259:08.74]Look, if I'm going to retire, I'll just say it, right?
[259:10.42]It's not like it's a big deal.
[259:14.10]Good shot, though.
[259:15.08]Good job you got that fucker.
[259:17.82]Mm-hmm.
[259:18.30]Yeah.
[259:20.01]That imposter was, seriously, like, causing problems and stuff.
[259:22.74]I'm just really glad that we don't have to worry about that guy anymore.
[259:27.90]What was his number?
[259:29.14]Number 12 or something?
[259:31.14]I don't know.
[259:32.28]Yeah, the police let me off, too, because they were like, well, you know, there's only, like, one Jerma here.
[259:38.34]The other guy wasn't even real.
[259:40.26]Yeah, that's fucked up.
[259:41.08]It was just a number.
[259:44.20]That was fucked up.
[259:46.82]Alright, so, the McDonald's order...
[259:51.73]This guy is, like, phasing through the wood.
[259:53.97]I knew you were going to kill him.
[259:55.12]Alright.
[259:55.94]McDonald's, wait 20 meters, and we've got a thingy.
[260:02.30]This way.
[260:02.58]Where is it?
[260:05.00]We're making progress.
[260:06.80]Oh, we got a thingy.
[260:07.34]Oh, I never found the last thingy.
[260:09.08]That's what I'm saying.
[260:09.64]It's over.
[260:10.46]It's over.
[260:13.09]This way.
[260:13.45]Oh, I'm playing hot and cold.
[260:18.23]I see a window down here.
[260:19.49]Yeah, it's definitely inside here.
[260:21.50]No.
[260:22.62]Like this side of the building?
[260:25.38]It's on this side.
[260:27.12]It's inside the building.
[260:28.76]It's gotta be inside this building.
[260:30.04]Yeah, it's inside.
[260:30.60]Do we got an entryway?
[260:32.51]Latch?
[260:33.35]Do you see any route?
[260:34.05]I don't see anything.
[260:37.79]Ah!
[260:38.23]Ah!
[260:39.47]I see bands.
[260:39.93]Found it.
[260:40.25]Alright, a lot of bodies.
[260:42.65]Sophie, I'm sorry.
[260:43.63]Alright, we got an entrance.
[260:44.33]I knew it.
[260:45.85]I knew those motherfuckers would betray us.
[260:49.41]Fuck them, Aiden.
[260:50.23]Kill them all.
[260:53.04]Okay, so it's in... Wait, is this the right area?
[260:59.28]I don't know.
[261:01.50]No.
[261:02.22]I'm back out on the street.
[261:04.03]Oh, god damn.
[261:04.97]No, it's definitely in there, up there.
[261:08.35]Okay, McDonald's order.
[261:09.23]My McDonald's order is... Wait.
[261:12.69]It's this way.
[261:13.66]We're really close.
[261:14.48]I got a gold statue, dude.
[261:15.80]A crystal statue.
[261:16.72]This is probably worth a lot.
[261:22.20]I gotta go.
[261:22.50]I don't know where I am.
[261:26.04]Do something.
[261:26.42]Yeah, scream or something in the game.
[261:27.84]There you are.
[261:31.58]Okay.
[261:31.92]Get up.
[261:32.95]Like, right down here, it's like two meters away.
[261:35.77]I think I got it.
[261:36.89]Yep.
[261:38.71]We have to go up the stairs.
[261:39.37]This is a chemical zone, though.
[261:42.25]Oh, shit.
[261:43.77]I don't know how you are where you are.
[261:45.42]There's like a biohazard door here.
[261:49.36]Walk from the inside...
[261:51.67]It's a hard lockpick.
[261:53.07]Oh, no.
[261:53.51]I'm about to be poisoned to death, dude.
[261:58.21]Do it.
[261:58.53]You got this.
[261:58.93]I got it.
[262:00.09]Oh, shit.
[262:00.35]This door is locked.
[262:02.43]What?
[262:04.19]Open it quick.
[262:04.94]Another hard lockpick.
[262:05.90]Two in a row.
[262:08.48]What the fuck?
[262:08.98]What the fuck, dude?
[262:10.02]We got a medium lockpick here.
[262:12.38]Hi!

[262:18.76]Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it!

[262:21.77]This thing was stupid!
[262:24.91]I got this one open.
[262:25.61]Oh, there's a sack in it.
[262:28.61]Old world money.
[262:29.93]Run!
[262:31.15]Wait, there's a crystal!
[262:31.88]I thought there was an epic mace in there, man.
[262:36.92]Get that crystal.
[262:39.24]What's this door?
[262:39.74]I don't know, get out!
[262:41.32]Locked from inside.
[262:43.00]Oh, what?
[262:45.11]Oh yeah, there's like a nighttime quest here.
[262:48.09]I'm dead down here.
[262:48.61]I don't know where I am.
[262:51.67]Oh my god!
[262:57.29]Whoops!
[263:00.04]Whoops.
[263:02.20]Okay.
[263:04.38]Pretty cool, man.
[263:06.54]That wasn't even the thing we were supposed to get.
[263:09.86]Oh, yes.
[263:10.42]Yeah, that wasn't it.
[263:12.68]Here, so you come, uh, this, it was down this street.
[263:18.78]Then you turn a right, you make a right.
[263:20.72]And then down this street, it goes down to like three, two, one, one.
[263:27.20]Is it right here?
[263:27.92]It's definitely, it's right here to the right.
[263:31.20]You can see through the walls.
[263:32.82]Can you?
[263:33.70]Yeah, it's right there.
[263:34.64]Oh yeah, you can.
[263:36.62]Is there a way to get in from here?
[263:37.66]Oh, we got a cop car.
[263:41.75]Not that many people there.
[263:45.07]Oh, the fucking order.
[263:46.15]Okay.
[263:48.19]The McDonald's order?
[263:49.24]What is this McDonald's order?
[263:50.26]McDonald's order.
[263:51.40]It has changed.
[263:54.71]I had a huge order before, but people misunderstood what I said.
[263:58.19]It was like five sandwiches and a bunch of McNuggets and stuff.
[264:02.68]What people didn't understand was that was a group order.
[264:05.04]That was supposed to be shared.
[264:07.88]They didn't take into account the shareables.
[264:11.36]You buy the nuggets for the group.
[264:12.92]You buy an extra sandwich for the group in case somebody wants a McChicken or whatever.
[264:16.28]It's a family pack.
[264:18.09]Yeah, essentially.
[264:21.62]The actual order is, are you ready?
[264:25.14]Get out your pen.
[264:26.78]Coffee.
[264:28.00]It is a medium 10-piece nugget meal with sweet and sour and honey mustard.
[264:39.41]And then it's two double cheeseburgers, not McDoubles, two double cheeseburgers without a pickle, no pickle.
[264:48.84]Ah, you lost me.
[264:52.10]And a Powerade.
[264:56.24]And if I'm feeling a little bit... If I'm feeling sloppy, an apple pie.
[265:01.70]If you're feeling kind of sloppy, you could go for the pie.
[265:04.26]Okay.
[265:08.58]I think that's pretty good.
[265:10.18]No pickle?
[265:10.70]No, I don't want pickles.
[265:13.56]I like eating pickles individually.
[265:14.96]I like pickles, but McDonald's pickles, I mean, pretty low on the totem pole.
[265:19.00]Exactly.
[265:19.20]I think we got to kill these bandits down here.
[265:21.80]I think that's our current situation.
[265:23.57]I think we were talking to Sophie about some premeditated murder.
[265:26.55]Okay.
[265:29.17]What's your order from McDonald's?
[265:32.07]My order from McDonald's is, like, go anywhere else.
[265:36.33]You're one of those people.
[265:37.07]Come on.
[265:38.52]If I have to, like if if like gun to my head, two double quarter pounders with cheese.
[265:44.11]OK.
[265:45.19]And no like no like made up extra stuff so that the person gets confused and is like, well, they're putting the pickles on.
[265:52.06]Anyway, that's mine.
[265:53.02]What are you talking about?
[265:55.75]Like you can't go to McDonald's and say well, I don't want to pick they're fucking putting the pickles on No, then they will take them off Shut up and like accept your pickles and then she takes the pickles off herself I think it's kind of weird too.
[266:06.71]I like pickles.
[266:07.39]I'm not gonna like make a big fuss about it I mean if it's tomatoes I'll tell them no tomatoes because that's like survivors Satanic
[266:18.67]Okay, so you mentioned earlier that if you had a choice, you wouldn't go to McDonald's.
[266:25.84]So where would you go instead?
[266:27.86]Well, when I lived in Boston, you know this place Boston, right?
[266:30.70]Oh, yeah, Boston.
[266:31.24]I know that city of Boston.
[266:32.08]Okay, yeah.
[266:32.62]So, like, there was a You Burger.
[266:34.56]Great place.
[266:35.36]You're Boston.
[266:36.12]You know You Burger, of course.
[266:38.00]Yes.
[266:38.22]And across the street, there was a McDonald's.
[266:39.66]And the McDonald's always had people walking into it.
[266:41.35]And I was like, what a bunch of fucking morons, right?
[266:44.21]So it really depends on the location.
[266:45.65]Like in that case, I'm going to you burger.
[266:47.37]But hold on, hold on, hold on.
[266:49.55]And you have got this all wrong.
[266:51.23]I'm supporting local business wherever possible.
[266:53.74]You got this all wrong.
[266:54.80]First of all, McDonald's is way faster than a restaurant like You Burger.
[266:58.88]You can literally drive to the drive-thru or walk in and have your meal in literally like 30 to 40 seconds.
[267:04.96]Nice eye, by the way.
[267:06.20]Hopefully it heals like the rest of the entire world.
[267:10.06]I was laughing.
[267:11.16]I had one of the gas tanks and it blew up during the cutscene.
[267:15.84]It was right behind us.
[267:16.80]I hope we're not dead.
[267:17.76]Oh, she's dead.
[267:20.75]She died of black right eye.
[267:22.93]You did it again.
[267:23.97]Oh my god.
[267:26.81]Anyways.
[267:27.23]We'll talk about this after we fight the tyrant, okay?
[267:33.03]Oh yeah, did you remember in Dying Light 1, the guy would always say, oh, fucking fuck this fucker.
[267:40.49]Oh, this fucker.
[267:41.07]This fucking guy was snotting this goon fucker.
[267:43.87]He's doing it again.
[267:51.55]I don't know how to change weapons back to my good weapon because it's my one weapon, but my one is my throwies?
[267:57.36]Are you looking for crystals or are you making me do all the work?
[268:00.00]Looking for crystals.
[268:01.36]Yes, that's the mission.
[268:03.14]Oh, I thought we got to kill the guy.
[268:04.16]He just lit himself on fire.
[268:06.96]He just walked right through the fire.
[268:08.38]I threw a bottle at him.
[268:15.88]Wait, what about this?
[268:17.46]Okay, so you were going to say something about my desire to support local business over McDonald's.
[268:22.31]No, what I said was there's a huge difference.
[268:25.33]You Burger is on a different tier than McDonald's is.
[268:28.20]Are we doing a tier list?
[268:29.83]That's like saying, oh, you know, the local, like, authentic Italian restaurant down the street from my house is... Well, exactly!
[268:35.41]Versus, but versus, like, a fast Italian, like, food place.
[268:39.57]You always have a choice.
[268:41.13]Everyone's always like, oh, Chipotle.
[268:43.11]Like, fucking, what?
[268:44.97]Chipotle is, like, the fence you want to... You die on fences now?
[268:49.81]What?
[268:50.55]Like, what people talk about with Chipotle... Hold on.
[268:53.77]I just threw... I just threw this tank at him and did half his health by hitting him in the head.
[268:59.24]Okay, we'll do it again.
[268:59.94]Okay, listen to me.
[269:04.02]How much it costs?
[269:04.80]How fast it is?
[269:06.74]Are you in a hurry?
[269:07.82]Do you want to sit down at like a restaurant?
[269:10.54]Right?
[269:10.84]Like, you could order takeout from some of these places, but it's not the same as getting like a cheeseburger from McDonald's.
[269:16.42]Okay, well, what is a Ron?
[269:18.99]A what?
[269:20.23]You can go in and you sit down and you can rest, but you can also Ron.
[269:24.49]Ron?
[269:25.79]Ron.
[269:26.57]Restaurant Ron.
[269:27.47]Like...
[269:31.80]Which one?
[269:32.28]Like, trick or treat.
[269:33.60]I understand that.
[269:34.46]Restaurant?
[269:35.56]I don't understand.
[269:36.24]Get back to the point that we were making before.
[269:40.15]Very important point.
[269:40.93]McDonald's and You Burger are not on the same tier of restaurant.
[269:46.01]In fact, I would probably assume... That's what I'm saying, though, is...
[269:50.51]That's exactly what I'm saying.
[269:51.65]You get to choose the tier of place you go to, right?
[269:53.94]Yes, but the different tiers exist for very specific reasons.
[269:56.84]You get McDonald's within like five minutes of walking in the restaurant.
[270:00.10]But You Burger is fast food as well.
[270:02.34]But it's not the same fast food.
[270:05.19]Yeah, it's better.
[270:06.19]And it's probably more expensive.
[270:11.61]Probably.
[270:12.21]How much is a single?
[270:15.15]I don't know.
[270:15.60]I've been here since I've done it.
[270:18.77]Okay, but it's more expensive and it's gonna take a little longer to get your food.
[270:21.63]So if you- okay, you got 20 minutes.
[270:24.26]Oh shit, okay, there's a You Burger right here, there's a McDonald's right here.
[270:26.78]I have literally 20 minutes before I have to go to my thing I'm doing.
[270:30.08]You're not gonna go order like a burger from You Burger because it's gonna take a little longer.
[270:34.44]It doesn't take 20 minutes.
[270:36.98]But you want to make sure that you can just get in there, get your two double cheeseburgers.
[270:40.78]Have you ever shown up on time for anything?
[270:42.74]You're going to You Burger.
[270:46.28]Oh, I feel like 10 minutes late.
[270:47.72]You're not thinking about this when you're going into the restaurant.
[270:50.66]Alright.
[270:50.92]The point still stands.
[270:52.74]There are
[271:06.52]McDonald's, there's a tier.
[271:09.16]McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King, Carl's Jr., Arby's.
[271:14.06]This tier, I'm morally opposed to the tier.
[271:17.06]You'd go to Arby's, wouldn't you?
[271:18.70]You'd go to Arby's, wouldn't you?
[271:19.97]Say it.
[271:20.33]I've actually had a really good Arby's sandwich before.
[271:22.15]Oh, and look at that.
[271:22.95]He's going to go to Arby's instead of McDonald's.
[271:24.89]That's exactly what I was talking about.
[271:26.45]I would go to Arby's over McDonald's.
[271:28.45]I'm sorry.
[271:29.05]Was that a problem?
[271:30.11]Yep, that's actually a huge problem.
[271:32.11]What's wrong with Arby's?
[271:34.83]It's alright.
[271:36.85]I knew you were gonna be a guy that was gonna go to Arby's instead of McDonald's.
[271:43.82]I mean, Arby's, I've only ever been like once.
[271:46.90]Okay, I've only been to Arby's because going on like a bus, like an actual public transport bus between Boston and New York, they would stop at an Arby's.
[271:58.72]And it's like, hey, if you guys want food, we're stopping at Arby's.
[272:01.74]You don't have a choice.
[272:03.90]So what did you get at Arby's?
[272:06.41]I don't know.
[272:08.29]I don't even know what any of their sandwiches are called.
[272:10.35]Have you been to Jack in the Box before?
[272:13.85]Jack in the Box and Sonic, which I think are the same place, both kind of just grossed me out and I don't think I've ever been.
[272:19.16]You're right about Sonic.
[272:20.40]You got Sonic, correct?
[272:21.66]Is Jack in the Box another IHOP?
[272:23.92]No.
[272:26.50]Jack in the Box is not equivalent.
[272:27.84]There's like Denny's, IHOP, Jack in the Box is not.
[272:29.76]No, no, no, he's wrong again.
[272:30.98]Okay, listen.
[272:32.12]Jack in the Box is like a McDonald's.
[272:33.39]I'm asking because I've never been, so I'm just, okay.
[272:36.93]Jack in the Box is like a McDonald's, but they have literally every food ever invented.
[272:40.75]I think you can order fucking spaghetti at Jack in the Box.
[272:43.25]Besides that, did you have to do that?
[272:47.47]No.
[272:49.39]I didn't know.
[272:52.26]Come help me.
[272:52.90]I got you.
[273:00.55]Okay, so we have to go to a trashy fast food.
[273:03.69]We have to.
[273:05.09]It has to happen.
[273:06.19]What is your number one pick?
[273:07.77]It's always McDonald's.
[273:08.77]Always.
[273:09.67]Well, how is it always McDonald's?
[273:10.79]Because I like McDonald's, and it's consistent, and it's fun, and it's delicious.
[273:14.52]And they had a clown.
[273:15.48]It was Ronald McDonald's.
[273:16.28]It was really cool.
[273:17.40]You're going to McDonald's because of the marketing?
[273:19.98]Because of the clown.
[273:20.88]Ronald McDonald's is cool, and they got rid of him.
[273:24.57]Have you guys noticed this?
[273:25.63]They Ster... When was the last time you... You don't go to McDonald's, so you can't relate to this.
[273:30.95]I mean, they're everywhere, so I've seen them.
[273:32.33]But no, I understand Ronald McDonald's is really, they're kind of phasing them out.
[273:36.01]Yeah, they turned McDonald's into like a weird little like cafe.
[273:40.03]They took out all the Ronald McDonald's.
[273:41.74]There's no more Grimace.
[273:43.82]I do feel like they're trying to Starbucks it up.
[273:48.18]I get what you're saying there.
[273:50.26]The food is still the same though.
[273:52.50]But they're trying to get rid of Ronald McDonald.
[273:55.22]And they're replacing him with like, yeah, like a Starbucks window.
[274:02.60]I don't think they did him.
[274:03.86]You know what?
[274:04.18]If they want... How about this?
[274:05.24]You know what I would have been okay with?
[274:07.06]If Ronald McDonald took the makeup off and he was Ronald.
[274:10.30]And it was like, look, he's a regular guy.
[274:11.46]It's like Ron, like Ronald.
[274:14.18]Like have him take the makeup off and just be like a regular guy.
[274:16.68]Like what's the problem?
[274:17.42]Why do you think get rid of him?
[274:19.00]I don't know.
[274:19.48]I could be down with a Ronald.
[274:23.09]Like you know that he like puts the makeup on and like just like makes people happy and stuff.
[274:27.37]But stop throwing bombs at me.
[274:32.45]That would be creepy?
[274:33.37]What?
[274:33.61]Oh my god, please.
[274:40.07]There's zombies over there.
[274:41.37]Got a couple dead.
[274:42.39]Yeah, he would be Ronald McDonald, right?
[274:46.85]But he wouldn't be the clown.
[274:48.25]He'd be like a regular guy.
[274:50.34]Maybe they could keep the hair?
[274:51.42]I don't know what they would do.
[274:55.50]Keep the nose?
[274:56.84]I'm surprised.
[274:58.62]There's one thing in my life...
[275:02.04]Okay, it's probably a problem with me.
[275:03.36]There's probably a lot of people that have no problem with this.
[275:05.60]If someone orders food through, like, an order food app, and it's McDonald's, I'm, like, morally deposed, and there's a nauseated, disgusting feeling in the pit of my stomach.
[275:16.97]Really?
[275:17.27]Yeah.
[275:18.21]To see, like, oh, here's your delivery with, like, the McDonald's M on it, it's just like, you fucking... Would you stay friends with this person?
[275:29.00]You would avoid this fucking person.
[275:33.44]We would.
[275:33.74]You've definitely done this.
[275:35.30]Yeah, we would avoid this person.
[275:36.74]But this is what I'm saying.
[275:37.76]You're like, oh, there's just 20 minutes.
[275:39.16]Do you stop at a McDonald's?
[275:40.36]Okay, you can order food from anywhere.
[275:42.54]A person will magically appear and be generated by the universe.
[275:45.92]Bring it to your door and then, like, disassemble as they leave.
[275:48.82]And you chose McDonald's.
[275:51.94]But what if it's not... What if they're not open?
[275:54.71]Some...
[275:55.90]McDonald's is open.
[275:56.98]If nothing else is open, but when is nothing else but McDonald's open?
[276:01.68]I guarantee I get this in the window or I'll give a hundred community subs.
[276:06.27]Thank you.
[276:08.75]The point is, if you are going to be in a scenario where you need something fast, yeah, you don't have to order like Uber eats McDonald's all the time, right?
[276:19.86]But McDonald's is usually faster than all of them.
[276:21.76]It's usually cheaper than all of them, but I like it.
[276:24.84]So that's all I have to say.
[276:30.57]Your argument is if there's... You could just say you like it.
[276:36.01]I like McDonald's.
[276:36.83]You can be wrong.
[276:37.73]It's cool.
[276:38.51]It's not being wrong.
[276:39.35]I think less of you, but... Okay, then you have to answer me this question.
[276:44.44]Yeah.
[276:45.88]McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Jack in the Box, Arby's...
[276:51.80]where are you going if you had to pick one if I had to pick one of those uh I think every time that's fair I think this guy's we gotta kill this guy permission that's fair will you help me kill this guy yeah hold on okay you got it I thought he just puked because like you thought he was gross
[277:24.10]I don't have enough stamina for these.
[277:26.38]There's another thing over here.
[277:32.20]But no, fast food.
[277:33.96]I genuinely like McDonald's.
[277:36.30]There's something else with it too.
[277:37.82]And you can call me, oh, cringe, cringe, oh, cringe, cringe, Andy.
[277:41.62]Well, I don't know.
[277:42.16]When I was a kid, going to McDonald's was, oh, let's get, I'm going to get like five, four nuggets.
[277:48.12]I'm going to get a happy meal.
[277:49.92]It's like a comfort food.
[277:53.51]It's like, oh yeah, I love the nuggets from McDonald's, right?
[277:56.35]It doesn't have to be like restaurant quality, high quality.
[278:01.06]Well, it is a restaurant, so it is restaurant quality.
[278:04.09]But which one would you choose, restaurant?
[278:06.75]If I wanted to go sit at a restaurant, of course...
[278:10.09]My palate is enormous.
[278:12.33]I'm dying.
[278:12.95]Hold up.
[278:14.13]I have such a sophisticated palate.
[278:16.51]I could eat, like, the nicest sushi in the world and then have an Uber Eats delivered to the restaurant at McDouble and I would be really happy about it.
[278:27.67]Oh, what's this?
[278:28.22]Oh, salmon sashimi?
[278:29.46]Oh, my God.
[278:29.90]It's so buttery in your mouth.
[278:31.98]Oh, yeah.
[278:32.24]The order's over here for me.
[278:33.04]Yeah, I had the ten nuggets and the two cheeseburgers.
[278:35.56]I mean, I...
[278:39.94]How did I get in here?
[278:45.20]You know what?
[278:45.66]It's fine.
[278:46.06]You can like what you like.
[278:46.98]That's totally a-okay.
[278:50.14]Says the person that said the Venom movie was terrible and that he was pissed that it even came out.
[278:54.58]I... I what?
[278:56.48]Says the guy that was pissed that the Venom movie came out and said the Venom movie was terrible and all... If you would like the Venom movie, you're an idiot.
[279:02.51]Remember that one?
[279:04.47]I didn't say that, but I wouldn't disagree.
[279:13.06]What the fuck are we doing?
[279:14.50]Like, where are you?
[279:16.01]I've been doing missions.
[279:16.63]I'm just running in circles.
[279:18.13]Come over to me.
[279:19.05]I don't know where you are.
[279:22.75]I'm just, like, bouncing into buildings over and over again.
[279:25.39]I'm trying to press Q for my supervision.
[279:27.21]This really is, like, a crack stream tonight.
[279:32.80]Okay.
[279:41.89]okay my character can't climb ladders anymore what the is I need your help I'm bleeding out quick now I'll admit McDonald's is the best I'll admit it alright no no I'll only revive you if you do the song I'll do the whole song you have to do you have to say and you're gonna put a lot into it or you're not getting revived I will do it I'll do it do it too late
[280:10.77]You dead?
[280:11.09]I'm dead.
[280:17.29]Where do you go from here?
[280:18.05]Can I pull you?
[280:23.68]Was that... You're just asking me what happens after you die?
[280:25.94]No, no.
[280:26.88]I mean, like, because you're the host, so you can pull me.
[280:29.32]I don't think I can pull you.
[280:30.66]I don't think you can pull me.
[280:31.56]I respawned.
[280:33.08]Okay.
[280:33.58]Well, let's just go to the mission.
[280:37.31]Okay.
[280:37.47]I'll meet you there.
[280:41.72]Sir, I will gift... I will gift 25 community subs in your channel if you do ba-da-ba-ba-ba, but you really lean into it, and it has to be good.
[280:49.89]And I'm the jaw-John if it's good or not.
[280:55.59]Uh... 25 is how much?
[281:00.36]I don't know.
[281:02.11]I started low because I figured you were going to negotiate me up.
[281:04.09]I'm doing the math of like, okay, McDonald's comes to your stream and is like, okay, we're going to sponsor your stream and you have to like really, like, we're going to judge you on how good this is and we're going to pay you like 50 bucks.
[281:15.04]Okay.
[281:16.92]So you're saying you want more?
[281:19.98]I'm saying... Okay, that math was way off.
[281:24.43]For like a sponsorship deal from McDonald's of like doing their logo...
[281:31.17]It's going to have to be, you know.
[281:32.97]Dude, it's got to be like, it's got to be like, da-da-da-da-da-da.
[281:37.15]Like, you've got to really go hard.
[281:39.67]Yeah.
[281:42.86]50?
[281:43.80]50 community subs?
[281:46.24]I mean, that's, I'm not going for it.
[281:50.72]No.
[281:52.32]Really?
[281:52.66]Okay.
[281:55.05]Yeah.
[281:55.59]100.
[281:55.77]I could tell, like, you're absolutely holding out on me.
[281:58.41]100 community subs.
[281:58.91]You're going to go to 100.
[282:00.09]I'll do it.
[282:01.24]I'm telling you right now, this better be good or else the money's off the table.
[282:06.38]You get one chance.
[282:07.84]Who gets to judge?
[282:09.04]Me.
[282:10.82]You're never going to think it's good enough because you're their number one fan.
[282:13.92]I'll know if you're giving it a half-assed attempt.
[282:17.95]I've known you for a long time.
[282:20.27]It's got to be the da-da-da-da-da-da.
[282:22.97]I'm loving it.
[282:24.48]I can give it the full attempt, and it won't be good.
[282:28.44]Does that still count?
[282:29.52]By the way, hopefully my credit card doesn't get declined, because otherwise this whole thing is over.
[282:36.82]Yeah, you're homeless.
[282:38.94]You don't even have 100 gift subs.
[282:40.98]Are you ready?
[282:43.81]I want the volume of this game to be gone, by the way.
[282:46.53]I want to hear this.
[282:50.25]Okay.
[282:52.51]Am I... I was still questioning if I do it and it's bad.
[282:56.78]Is bad the same as not trying?
[282:59.00]No.
[282:59.64]No, I'll know.
[283:01.04]Okay.
[283:02.28]You're going to give it an attempt.
[283:03.78]I'll give it to you.
[283:05.50]100 community subs.
[283:08.36]Nah.
[283:09.30]What?
[283:10.90]Nah, it's honestly not worth it.
[283:12.02]What?
[283:12.64]Are you serious?
[283:14.04]Yeah.
[283:15.62]What the fuck?
[283:16.28]I have to go higher?
[283:18.10]I mean...
[283:20.12]It's my integrity.
[283:21.36]When we all agree that McDonald's is disgusting.
[283:24.23]I didn't say that.
[283:27.13]Alright, 125 community subs.
[283:28.69]I don't know, I feel like any second someone's going to gift me 100 to not do it.
[283:38.83]The longer we stall.
[283:42.07]I feel like we're kind of getting into that territory.
[283:43.77]He's not going to do it.
[283:45.07]Like, don't you all get to see fucking Mr. Scrooge Miser or Jerma get what he wants all the time?
[283:49.89]He just buys people.
[283:52.15]Shouldn't I stand up to him?
[283:54.61]No, no, nobody stands up to me.
[283:56.69]I'm not doing it.
[283:58.95]What?
[284:02.15]Fine, I'll do it.
[284:02.81]Someone has to do it.
[284:06.61]It can't not be done.
[284:10.09]I'm loving it.
[284:12.63]You could have just had $1,000, sir.
[284:16.03]That was trying.
[284:17.05]That's your bar for trying really hard.
[284:19.25]That was good.
[284:20.67]Give me the barrel back.
[284:21.59]I'll do better.
[284:22.89]No, you're not taking it.
[284:23.90]It's off the table.
[284:25.94]There's no deal at all.
[284:26.80]No, you declined it.
[284:29.96]Give me the barrel.
[284:30.94]No, you're not taking the barrel because the deal is off.
[284:33.11]You declined it.
[284:33.79]You declined the deal, so you're not getting another chance.
[284:35.73]The deal's off.
[284:36.17]You didn't want to do it.
[284:37.57]Like I said, I don't need the money.
[284:38.91]I just want to do it because you're making a fool of yourself up here and you're like... What?
[284:51.74]Did you do it?
[284:52.26]I didn't hear anything.
[284:53.14]Oh, really?
[284:55.22]That cut out?
[284:57.24]Discord saved you.
[284:59.52]That joke didn't land none.
[285:04.94]Do you want to try it again?
[285:05.66]Okay.
[285:06.98]Let's try again.
[285:11.87]I'm loving it.
[285:12.45]Get off the fucking barrel.
[285:13.29]Get off the barrel.
[285:13.75]That was awful.
[285:14.71]Get off the barrel.
[285:25.56]You'll never do better than that.
[285:26.58]There's not a fucking chance in hell.
[285:28.19]Well, you... Are we doing like beatboxing?
[285:30.49]No, I'm just saying that that was incredible.
[285:39.13]No one will do better than that.
[285:42.18]Yeah, my chat's saying it was forced.
[285:44.40]What?
[285:44.82]It's an ad, of course.
[285:45.74]No, this is not an ad.
[285:46.72]This is not sponsored.
[285:47.78]This is not a sponsored stream.
[285:50.08]Let me make that clear.
[285:50.98]I'm just saying like the jingle is an ad, so it has to be like... Just go.
[285:56.36]Just do your thing, please.
[285:59.11]hold on hold on so like like we can ex like you don't just do the jingle you like the longer you do like some cringe shit before like oh I'm loving it oh like the more you do like the better you think it is alright let's go to the mission marker they don't go
[286:25.16]In the commercials, they don't go... What are you doing?
[286:31.38]Well, what were you doing?
[286:32.18]You were doing like a... You know, you're like... They don't like moan.
[286:37.11]They don't... They also don't beatbox.
[286:41.21]Can we just finish this mission for God's sake?
[286:43.35]Ronald would be disappointed.
[286:51.42]Cool.
[286:51.64]Alright.
[286:52.08]Mission time.
[286:54.59]You're never going to get out of the tutorial zone.
[287:02.96]Is this whole zone a tutorial?
[287:05.18]We apparently are taking so long.
[287:07.02]Okay, well, I'm here.
[287:13.77]You're not here.
[287:14.97]I'll be there in a sec.
[287:16.92]Also, it cut out.
[287:18.32]You didn't hear.
[287:18.88]I did not hear you do that at all.
[287:20.74]I heard... For like a solid five seconds, I screamed at the top of my lungs.
[287:26.44]Are you serious?
[287:27.66]Yeah, Discord did not like that.
[287:31.91]All that we heard on my stream was... I guess that means I should wait here.
[287:35.93]Yeah, Discord was like, noise cancellation, you're gone.
[287:39.29]I'm impressed.
[287:40.15]Hold on.
[287:40.51]Let me see.
[287:50.37]What happened to the game?
[287:53.23]Uh, we're inhibiting.
[287:53.91]What?
[287:57.58]This is what you did?
[287:58.42]Did you do it?
[287:59.18]I didn't hear anything.
[288:18.80]you just screamed in my face and I don't hear that that's like I'm baiting you that has to be right yeah no I'm pretty sure Discord will like you can do stuff like you can snap your fingers if you're not talking and the snap won't go through Discord that was ridiculous but you screamed for so long you would think it would come through I yeah I thought like a little like even the beginning of it would but no I gotta are we in like a dream yeah we are
[288:49.43]You got any opinions on dreams that I don't know about?
[288:52.41]I feel like that's a thing you'd have a whole bit about.
[288:55.89]What about dreaming?
[288:56.99]Yeah, I don't know.
[288:57.85]It just seems like a thing that you'd be into.
[288:59.66]I mean, it's kind of interesting that we do that.
[289:01.50]Our brains are so overactive that even while they're turned off, they have to be functioning and have to be doing things.
[289:09.67]Like a shark.
[289:11.57]It's pretty weird.
[289:17.09]oh is this like where we remember that the girl we've been looking for this whole time actually burned alive and we don't need to look for anymore and the game's over that's weird why did that guy show up yeah is he a part of the dream are you downloading um lego Star Wars angry birds whatever it was uh no I had a bad feeling about it from the start he kind of lied to us then plan sucked and yet I let him I said I would try anything once I did
[289:47.91]Cool.
[289:49.33]I mean, like, if someone put it in front of me, I would try it.
[289:52.63]But it's a whole other story when you gotta, like, you gotta, like, I don't have an iPad.
[289:56.97]This game's fun.
[289:57.57]Okay, meat.
[289:58.03]Okay.
[289:58.79]Has anyone ever told you it's weird that you call them community subs?
[290:17.08]Community subs?
[290:18.74]Yeah, like community gifted subs.
[290:20.90]I've never heard anyone say that ever.
[290:24.68]And do me a favor.
[290:26.58]Scroll over the gift a sub.
[290:30.58]I'm sure that's what the full like long exact phrasing of it is.
[290:35.36]I'm sure it is.
[290:37.06]But it seems weird like when you could say like gifted subs.
[290:40.04]Oh, but it's the same.
[290:41.14]That's literally the definition of what it is.
[290:42.80]It's a community sub.
[290:43.84]It's a gifted community.
[290:44.91]It's a community sub.
[290:47.04]I'm not disagreeing.
[290:47.88]Well, what do you call it?
[290:50.48]Thanks for the gifted subs?
[290:51.46]Thanks for the community subs?
[290:53.57]Gifted.
[290:53.95]Just gifted.
[290:54.49]It's shorter.
[290:54.87]Yeah, but I mean, it's classified as a community sub.
[290:59.87]There are prime subs, right?
[291:01.77]There are community subs, and then there are, like, regular subs, right?
[291:05.15]Yeah, but when the thing happens, it'll say, so-and-so gifted 10 subs.
[291:09.07]Yeah, they gifted a... So-and-so gifted 10 community subs.
[291:15.09]Are we reaching for, like, content right now?
[291:16.83]For, like, funny things to talk about?
[291:17.93]No, I was... I thought there was one of those things there.
[291:21.65]Oh, there is.
[291:25.28]Hey, watch out, guys.
[291:25.82]We got one of those things.
[291:26.64]There is?
[291:27.02]Oh, it's right over there.
[291:31.28]Oh, it comes to chase.
[291:32.10]Let's see what you have what it takes to beat me.
[291:36.16]I'm fucking done.
[291:37.39]I'm done.
[291:37.71]I'm being chased.
[291:39.55]What happened?
[291:41.33]Uh, I don't know.
[291:45.08]You're dying.
[291:45.54]I got tutorialed.
[291:47.16]Yeah, you're dying in the tutorial.
[291:48.67]Oh, there's like a super monster above you.
[291:51.35]I think that's like an ultra volatile.
[291:53.38]Oh.
[291:56.36]What the fuck is this?
[292:07.57]I'm bleeding out.
[292:08.45]I'm dead.
[292:09.61]God damn it.
[292:11.27]I thought you had way more time.
[292:12.73]I lost 113 community subs for that.
[292:16.22]Man.
[292:17.06]I thought you were going to say I lost like 10 quarts of blood.
[292:26.96]I'm being chased.
[292:32.11]Oh, it is like a super mutant.
[292:33.77]Do you want to try to kill him?
[292:35.73]I don't think we can.
[292:36.67]I think it's a volatile.
[292:39.26]It's kind of right in the way that I want to go.
[292:41.32]Unless we run from him for like six hours and he falls into a fence, you can't kill him.
[292:47.61]There's a container right here.
[292:48.57]I don't know.
[292:49.13]You probably don't care, though.
[292:50.49]I'm coming back to you.
[292:51.29]I made a loop around.
[292:52.09]I lost him.
[292:53.71]He's over here.
[292:54.35]The big super mutant guy's over here.
[292:58.23]He literally can see us right now.
[292:59.31]He can see you.
[292:59.79]No, he can't.
[293:01.95]People are saying that we can kill this thing easily.
[293:05.01]They think we're overreacting.
[293:07.48]Okay.
[293:09.40]Let's do it.
[293:10.16]I'm chasing this, like, thing.
[293:15.22]I can't hit him.
[293:15.88]Give me that.
[293:16.94]What the fuck, dude?
[293:19.41]Hey, I just... What?
[293:22.77]That's a homing missile into his stomach.
[293:24.81]I just got a loot goblin.
[293:30.61]Well, it's daytime now.
[293:33.41]Maybe he'll just die.
[293:34.01]Oh, he's gone.
[293:40.47]Wait, they play the Five Nights at Freddy's thing when you get to, like, 6 AM?
[293:43.13]I guess.
[293:56.72]Uh, we can't open this.
[293:58.66]Ah, let's just do the mission.
[294:00.22]We got the, like, military truck here if you want to, you know, you know.
[294:03.04]Oh.
[294:03.50]Sure.
[294:03.88]The mission is also right there.
[294:07.60]Okay, can we do more than one of these locks?
[294:11.22]Oh, and there's 15 meters to an inhibitor.
[294:13.74]Yeah, it's like right here.
[294:16.76]I'm trying to find it.
[294:20.28]Oh, it's inside here.
[294:21.92]It's inside of this thing.
[294:22.64]I don't know how to change my weapon.
[294:26.53]Three.
[294:29.15]Oh, I get it.
[294:29.87]I thought it was... Okay.
[294:31.37]Yeah, it's just three.
[294:33.39]I think we have to go in through the roof.
[294:34.29]One, two, three, four.
[294:36.46]What?
[294:37.52]This doesn't open.
[294:41.36]Do we have to open this?
[294:47.44]Oh, we have to kill the monster.
[294:52.13]That's annoying.
[294:53.85]Oh, this is a night mission.
[294:54.71]We can wait till night.
[294:55.95]Let's just do it.
[294:56.75]Let's kill it.
[294:59.41]Wait, how do we do that?
[295:00.63]It said hold T, that's not doing anything.
[295:04.44]T?
[295:08.57]the mission we're doing is right here alright fine we could also sleep too yeah I don't know Ster doesn't want to sleep we haven't slept in the entire five hours I don't know how you just press e next to a bed

[295:51.87]The Patriots.
[295:53.35]Alright.
[295:54.87]What is the score of the game right now?
[295:56.53]Ster, don't look at your chat.
[295:57.51]I'm going to give you a guess.
[295:58.43]Don't give any time.
[295:59.17]I think it's 10-3 Rams.
[296:01.29]What's your guess?
[296:02.05]Say it before we chat.

[296:16.42]Oh.
[296:16.48]20 to 2016.
[296:16.84]Bengal is winning.
[296:17.28]How much time is left in the game?
[296:29.11]Okay.
[296:42.94]Stop gambling.
[296:44.10]Take care of yourself, Pilgrim.
[296:46.99]Join the party.
[296:51.64]How do we wait?
[296:58.86]So you'd go to the nighttime mission and hold T, but that's like a nighttime mission down there.
[297:03.27]There's like a bed in here?
[297:04.77]We can sleep in the bed.
[297:08.93]As long as we can actually... Somebody told us earlier that some safe houses do not have a bed.
[297:14.21]This safe house sucks.
[297:16.71]What's the point?
[297:18.04]I don't know.
[297:20.22]It's 56 meters away.
[297:21.06]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[297:24.34]I thought I could grab onto the edge.
[297:28.20]Oh, you heal with these.
[297:29.26]Oh, my God.
[297:30.64]You can just heal with this.
[297:32.08]We could go to the windmill.
[297:36.08]Windmill is over here, right?
[297:39.60]Want to go to the maple windmill?
[297:44.11]Aren't we doing like, there's a main quest like 50 meters away behind you?
[297:48.95]Yeah.
[297:49.29]That we're currently on.
[297:51.31]And we keep talking about how we're going to do it.
[297:53.51]And then we start talking about McDonald's for like an hour.
[297:58.28]Yeah, but I mean, so what?
[298:08.14]What else do you talk about when you're like gaming with a buddy?
[298:12.64]Um, I mean, I'm not judging the McDonald's conversation.
[298:17.13]I'm just saying that we're right next to this objective and I feel like we should finish it.
[298:20.77]I'm going to get McDonald's tonight just because you said that.
[298:23.23]You're going to order McDonald's on Super Bowl Sunday night.
[298:27.93]What's wrong with that?
[298:28.41]You're going to eat your McDonald's.
[298:31.25]By yourself.
[298:34.70]What are we doing here?
[298:35.52]Why do you think I'm by myself?
[298:41.44]What are we doing here?
[298:42.08]All players required.
[298:42.88]I don't know.
[298:44.30]Oh, for what?
[298:45.64]There's a thing here we can press E. Where?
[298:56.58]You say you're dead now, fucker?
[298:59.13]Yeah, he said we're dead.
[299:00.03]Look at him.
[299:00.43]I don't feel too well.
[299:01.07]Somebody's in trouble right near here.
[299:25.50]All I hear is, let me go, help!
[299:27.44]Oh, wait, where'd Sophie go?
[299:29.15]Wait, what the fuck?
[299:29.81]Why is this guy attacking me?
[299:34.33]I can't even take my weapon out.
[299:36.55]Why is this guy in the cutscene?
[299:38.61]This guy hacked the cutscene.
[299:40.27]Jesus Christ, I can't do anything.
[299:41.87]Who is this guy?
[299:44.57]Wait, why am I back up?
[299:46.33]I revived you, I did it.
[299:48.50]Why can't I attack him?
[299:50.10]Because you're in a cutscene area.
[299:53.98]He's crawling to you.
[299:59.45]Oh, not in the cutscene anymore, huh?
[300:02.55]Tough guy, huh?
[300:04.29]Now we have to redo that.
[300:07.18]Wait a minute.
[300:07.96]Wait a minute.
[300:09.60]Somebody at this site had a mask on when we first touched it.
[300:13.66]What?
[300:22.15]I saw him in the corner of my eye he was just hanging out are we gonna ask around to find out where sophie went who are we asking we we got that cutscene screwed up we have to talk to the people here I'm looking for if you can oh what did she say I don't know what does this guy have to say I said ask around this guy seems like he knows something how many years ago did the zombie thing happen

[300:48.13]Yeah, it's been two.

[300:49.89]Talk to this guy.
[300:50.97]Talk to this guy.
[300:51.81]No.
[300:52.29]Behind you.
[300:52.59]Talk to this guy.
[300:53.13]Talk to this guy.
[300:53.81]I can't.
[300:55.71]Talk to this guy.
[300:56.81]Talk to this guy.
[300:58.37]Talk to this guy.
[300:59.87]Talk to this guy.
[301:00.53]I am.
[301:02.33]You're annoying.
[301:08.72]I don't have time.
[301:13.52]That was really sad.
[301:14.36]He looked really sad right there.
[301:17.18]we killed his friend he's wondering where he went let's talk to this person okay oh I think it's gonna be a mcflurry night tonight I thought you said you don't get mcflurries yeah but you mentioned it I'll change it up do you like do you like the m m's in it when it turns all like brown
[301:44.38]Are you able to repair weapons?
[301:47.19]I don't think so.
[301:47.87]I thought there was like a repair kit thing.
[301:51.01]I'm just a hater.
[301:53.11]That's all there is to it.
[301:55.47]Who am I hating?
[301:56.41]McDonald's.
[301:58.93]Why?
[301:59.17]You said like three times you hate McDonald's.
[302:02.47]I hate McDonald's.
[302:06.58]We should do this.
[302:07.76]It's right here.
[302:13.29]No repairs?
[302:14.27]You got to craft all that shit on your weapon, then it breaks and you got to do it again every time?
[302:24.34]Are you aware of what IGN's game of all time is?
[302:27.84]Ocarina of Time?
[302:28.46]No.
[302:30.52]They made a revised list of their game.
[302:33.80]I just, I don't know what them.
[302:35.87]What was number one?
[302:38.43]Breath of the Wild is now the new best game of all time.
[302:41.37]Is there?
[302:42.71]Yeah.
[302:43.09]What's in the top five?
[302:43.81]Is there more in there?
[302:49.75]I can't remember.
[302:50.55]It was all very upsetting.
[302:53.17]But isn't Breath of the Wild... Isn't Breath of the Wild supposed to be really, really good?
[302:58.58]How could Breath of the Wild be any good when all it did was copy Genshin Impact?
[303:02.54]Would you rather it be Ocarina of Time?
[303:04.44]Can we be honest?
[303:06.76]I would feel like I could see where they were coming from if it was Ocarina of Time.
[303:10.10]Right, but like...
[303:13.82]Ocarina of Time is what everybody says.
[303:15.86]Are you telling me the best game ever made in all of history is on the Nintendo Switch?
[303:25.31]So what?
[303:26.37]Oh, turn around and look.
[303:27.47]Is this what you're saying?
[303:29.33]Look at how beautiful the graphics are.
[303:31.37]It's so wonderful.
[303:32.39]This wouldn't run on a Switch.
[303:33.75]That's what you're saying?
[303:34.82]So a game can't be good if it has, like, not incredible.
[303:37.98]Beautiful.
[303:38.44]I would say 10 out of 10.
[303:39.24]DirectX 12, I think, graphics.
[303:41.46]I'm just saying, the entire history of game development, if you really think about, like, what is the best thing?
[303:47.10]If you just narrowed it down to what, like...
[303:52.13]What's your favorite game of all time?
[303:54.09]Favorite game of all time?
[303:55.41]Yeah.
[303:56.37]Hide the sausage.
[303:59.11]What the fuck is that?
[304:00.19]I mean, you could play that on anything.
[304:09.22]What's your favorite video game of all time?
[304:13.74]I'm jumping.
[304:15.04]Why are you jumping?
[304:17.12]Hey, I got blocked!
[304:19.66]We gotta go down there to meet Sophie.
[304:22.41]Favorite video game of all time?
[304:24.40]Are you alive?
[304:25.82]Yes.
[304:26.64]Okay, if Ocarina of Time is acceptable to you, Breath of the Wild is not acceptable to you, what is acceptable to you as number one?
[304:36.01]Like, you.
[304:37.65]uh what what is your number one like or at least something in the top well no this is about what is acceptable to me or what I would choose what would you choose what I would choose is not the best game of all time okay so what if I had to wait a minute most acceptable one so you're saying that people have opinions yeah people have opinions okay so what is your favorite people like McDonald's what's your favorite game of all time
[305:00.88]um I feel like I'm gonna forget because I haven't ever like played one I could tell you but mine is tell me if it doesn't help you if it's Diablo II or like Bloodborne wait you close you had it I had it it's probably Bloodborne
[305:20.65]that's probably my favorite game of all time but the reason why I'm saying maybe not is because it only released on PS4 at 30 FPS yeah it's just like it yeah so like wouldn't it suck if the best game of all time was only on the Nintendo Switch yeah but still if Bloodborne is like sorry for Bloodborne it's making you question it Diablo II the wild you're like I don't know
[305:44.54]Because I don't particularly care that much about Zelda.
[305:48.28]Because there's people in chat that are like, you don't want to upset them, but you'll be all blood-borne.
[305:54.48]I talked a full college essay about how I don't like the Zelda games.
[306:00.87]So you're barking up the absolute wrong tree here.
[306:07.31]Sneaky motherfuckers.
[306:09.06]Diablo II, Team Fortress 2, and Bloodborne, and... Hegel's pretty damn good, but that's not on there.
[306:20.39]It was a fun list because of how lazy it looks.
[306:23.15]Like, around number 50 is all of the Blizzard games.
[306:26.69]It's just like, I don't know, Starcraft, Diablo, World of Warcraft, like, whatever.
[306:31.00]is this one blizzard game that was made by blizzard north like 25 years ago I'm gonna hit you with this because you're a big fan okay World of Warcraft was like top 50 in this top 100 list game of all time yeah I agree around I think around top 10 or 20 was Final Fantasy 14 it's got the most guards are we talking about like cultural impact are we talking just like what game was actually the best like video game
[306:56.88]I don't know I think I think it was the best that still holds up in a pincer movement if anything goes wrong we retreat to our base okay well you're you're dashing you're dashing that you're you're dodging the question I'm dashing I'm dodging what is your favorite game of all time no I I think it actually would be like the other two or Bloodborne oh we're on the same page here so we completely agree okay yeah that's why we know we're both right
[307:24.30]Oh, that's how we know our opinion is correct because we both have it.
[307:27.84]Oh, okay.
[307:29.40]Like if anyone else were to come into the conversation and be like, I don't know.
[307:31.95]And that's not a problem, right?
[307:34.29]That's not a problem.
[307:35.33]Well, we have majority.
[307:36.63]Yeah, you and I have the same opinion.
[307:39.65]Therefore, it's correct.
[307:41.15]That's kind of how it works.
[307:42.09]Are we doing monkey bars right now?
[307:46.55]Kind of.
[307:48.49]I'm just vibing, man.
[307:51.47]Alright, so here you go.
[307:53.62]So Diablo II, obviously, right?
[307:56.14]Blizzard game.
[307:57.26]Blizzard game.
[307:58.40]Is it telling me how to do stealth right now?
[308:00.12]We are getting a lot of these.
[308:02.30]Change of plans, Aiden.
[308:03.98]They attacked our safe house.
[308:07.36]We're getting a lot of these.
[308:08.67]Why does this game have four tutorials?
[308:10.57]Jack and Joe's camp?
[308:13.33]Is this Joe?
[308:15.11]Who is this?
[308:16.21]That might be Joe.
[308:18.87]Behind you.
[308:24.09]This is the same guy.
[308:28.11]I think that guy's on our side.
[308:29.37]The warrior.
[308:30.67]Wait, whose team are we on?
[308:31.85]I don't know.
[308:35.09]I think we're on blue.
[308:35.93]Our shirts are blue.
[308:37.49]Did you just hit me?
[308:38.43]Who's this person?
[308:39.61]Some other guy.
[308:42.51]You're dying, man.
[308:49.35]Okay, I'm just going to kill everybody.
[308:57.11]Just kill everyone.
[309:00.88]Yup, I knew it.
[309:03.98]What?
[309:09.76]Did you get him?
[309:10.38]I snorted.
[309:16.45]I don't usually.
[309:19.36]Going back up here?
[309:20.28]No, I don't want to eat that.
[309:22.18]I have a question.
[309:23.62]What's your favorite video game?
[309:25.10]No.
[309:26.22]What are these pointed spikes preventing from coming forward?
[309:30.50]Like, what is this preventing?
[309:31.56]Helicopters?
[309:33.74]Like an orc invasion.
[309:36.35]They're like things that they put on the side to climb up the building.
[309:42.01]I see.
[309:42.47]Okay.
[309:43.75]Alright.
[309:44.07]So we got to go kill Jack and Joe.
[309:47.27]Oh, jumpers.
[309:48.07]Oh, we got jumpers.
[309:50.27]That's true, they do jump.
[309:54.59]That guy has one of those tape measures on song machine things.
[309:57.65]What does this thing do?
[310:05.62]Oh.
[310:07.54]What is it?
[310:10.89]Alert!
[310:11.55]Alert!
[310:12.43]Bugs!
[310:13.33]Bees!
[310:20.24]How is he still alive?
[310:21.59]Why is he alive?
[310:29.33]Why are you silent?
[310:38.10]Me?
[310:38.36]It's so much more menacing when you don't say anything.
[310:43.01]I yelled like on my screen he sprinted off this platform at like 10 times speed and then teleport it back and you're like why is he alive well because because he what is this what is this nobody's coming man we killed everybody here oh behind what
[311:08.66]They're going to keep trying to come off the ladder.
[311:09.96]I'll take care of the guys on the ladder.
[311:11.08]Oops.
[311:12.85]Oh, he's doing it again.
[311:14.15]He's doing it again.
[311:20.73]I think it's working.
[311:23.05]It kind of is working.
[311:28.15]Wow.
[311:29.01]Oh, wow.
[311:31.47]Get off.
[311:39.01]He's dead.
[311:43.51]Hi.
[311:43.89]I got it.
[311:44.26]I got it.
[311:44.66]This guy, I'm bludgeoning his face.
[311:46.54]I'm bludgeoning his face.
[311:47.58]I'm your savior.
[311:48.20]I'm bludgeoning it.
[311:48.88]Thanks, dude.
[311:53.06]More people are just coming up.
[311:54.60]What is Jack and Jill?
[311:59.37]Jack and Jill went up the hill.
[312:03.59]Okay.
[312:05.71]I need to craft a heal or something, man.
[312:08.05]Yeah, I'm dying, man.
[312:11.14]Where do all these people live?
[312:12.26]Dude, there's a giant skyscraper right here.
[312:21.07]OK, this is a city.
[312:27.63]They're apparently still in here.
[312:31.68]There's a bunch of people down there at the.
[312:35.22]At the cultist symbol.
[312:37.98]Oh, there's one of them.
[312:39.24]Oh, do you do that too?
[312:39.92]Do you call every human enemy in every game a cultist?
[312:45.62]No, I don't.
[312:46.26]I was literally talking about this weird symbol altar that they have set up.
[312:49.90]I don't know why.
[312:50.40]I'm always just like, oh, cultists.
[312:51.38]There's some cultists here.
[312:54.83]By the way, have you noticed that, like, oh, look out!
[312:57.89]Bandits!
[312:58.33]There's bandits everywhere!
[312:59.35]Bandits!
[313:00.37]That guy's doing the thing.
[313:01.85]There are more bandits in video games than people that are populating the actual towns.
[313:06.47]Have you noticed this?
[313:08.09]Of course I've noticed it.
[313:08.99]It's like for every one person that lives in these game worlds, there's like 5,000 bandits.
[313:15.09]Well, in order for them to sell me this game, they need to satiate my unquenchable thirst for blood and destruction.
[313:20.54]So, like I have to kill.
[313:25.78]This music machine guy is still up here.
[313:28.38]He's going to throw a rock at you, man.
[313:35.63]He missed.
[313:43.47]The first thing you unlock is this jump from the air kick.
[313:47.58]How?
[313:51.00]I'll distract him.
[313:51.62]Oh, my face!
[313:54.70]What was that?
[313:58.94]What's that song?
[314:11.14]That's the song that plays.
[314:12.81]Why are there a bunch of people coming?
[314:14.55]Alright, bring him over here so I can do my jump kick.
[314:20.03]I mean, how do you do it?
[314:21.06]I don't know.
[314:29.16]I think it's E or F. You jump and hit E. It's E because the kick is E.
[314:39.67]What the fuck?
[314:40.33]It didn't do anything.
[314:41.07]That's what I'm saying.
[314:42.77]Are we both dead?
[314:52.07]You can't believe it.
[314:58.77]I'm dead.
[315:05.38]It's jumping F since you swapped binds.
[315:07.94]I checked I unlocked it.
[315:11.69]Yeah, it's whatever your kick button is.
[315:14.79]Press U. Press U. Do you have it unlocked?
[315:17.73]I do.
[315:18.23]I've never been able to do it.
[315:19.23]Air kick is the first thing.
[315:20.19]When dropping on enemies from above, nail them with a power kick.
[315:24.83]Fall in the air, look down at an enemy, and hold E. Behind the air, look down at an enemy, and hold F to execute.
[315:31.57]Alright, well let's go kill that motherfucker.
[315:34.97]Let's go.
[315:42.73]It's still E even if you change it.
[315:45.10]Really?
[315:47.64]No, it's not.
[315:49.02]There's a bug with binding.
[315:50.66]Somebody said there's a bug with binding.
[315:52.16]That guy's lying to you.
[315:55.30]Don't listen to him.
[315:57.05]I feel like they're correct, though.
[315:58.53]Don't even listen.
[315:59.15]Well, I never rebind it, and I still can't do it.
[316:02.81]Somebody said, I wish your computer was still bad.
[316:04.77]Why?
[316:06.75]I mean, this is like a clean 60 FPS.
[316:08.69]This is
[316:22.69]Let me help you.
[316:23.09]Did you just take it out of my hand?
[316:26.55]What happened?
[316:27.51]What?
[316:28.79]My hand is still... My hand is still on it.
[316:33.18]What?
[316:36.32]Look.
[316:41.48]I'm... What?
[316:45.96]I have no idea what happened there.
[316:48.60]Alright, where is this guy?
[316:50.50]Isn't he right here?
[316:51.78]No, we got... He's at the occultist.

[319:44.08]I say that because it runs.
[319:45.08]Let me show you my Ubisoft game experience.
[319:51.30]I'm going to look from this side of the screen to this side of the screen.
[320:13.22]Oh, what?
[320:14.64]Jerma.
[320:16.48]I need you.
[320:18.71]You'll agree with me on this.
[320:21.09]Okay.
[320:22.95]You stand here and you look in the room.
[320:24.55]Like, that's your room.
[320:25.77]That's, like, your streamer den.
[320:27.38]Wouldn't it be really cool if you had, like, how dogs have the hole and you can walk in the room and see?
[320:33.85]you've got a homie hole so like your homies can just like come in and join you at any time and it has like the dog flap like hey what's up guys I mean you this is like the streamer room lighting yeah yeah but also you've just got like a hole in the wall so your friends can come in why would I want this I just told you why because because my friends can come in yeah
[321:03.82]Like, you know, like, your webcam isn't pointed there.
[321:05.87]It's like, you can't come through the door, and, like, people know you're coming in, so you need to, like, come in in the homie hole, and that comes out, like, under your desk or something.
[321:13.65]What?
[321:14.60]Why would it be under the desk?
[321:16.10]I can't believe I let them fool me like that well so it's like a secret so you can like hide and crawl under the desk so okay you're telling me that you want the desk here sitting here and you want a spot for someone to be able to come under here under the desk why do you have like an l desk because they can like crawl under the whole l what are you talking about
[321:38.99]That's pretty cool.
[321:40.61]What?
[321:41.23]Like, isn't that like fun?
[321:42.55]Did you ever do those?
[321:43.97]You like McDonald's, right?
[321:45.03]The ball pit.
[321:45.69]I love that place.
[321:46.41]Tunnels you can crawl through.
[321:47.43]Or is that Chuck E. Cheese?
[321:50.33]You know, Chuck E. Cheese.
[321:51.42]What was the last time you were at Chuck E. Cheese?
[322:01.68]I went one time when I was very young.
[322:03.82]I don't remember how old.
[322:06.40]Did you ever bring your report card to get free tokens?
[322:11.78]I don't think so.
[322:12.84]I remember that being a thing, though.
[322:14.48]If you had at least... I've told this story before, but I'm telling it again.
[322:17.98]If you had at least A or B average, and you brought your report card to Chuck E. Cheese, they would give you, like, 20 free tokens.
[322:25.47]And it was a huge deal to every kid in the town and neighborhood, whatever.
[322:29.47]It was like, oh, I get free tokens, Chuck E. Cheese.
[322:32.71]So I had a brother and sister, obviously, right?
[322:35.63]So we would go, and I would have, like, Ds and Cs.
[322:39.43]I was a fucking dumb kid, right?
[322:41.61]And they would always just kind of lump me in with my brother and sister that had As and Bs.
[322:46.97]So I'd be like, oh, here's your report card.
[322:48.51]You've got, oh, yes, you do.
[322:49.69]You've got As.
[322:50.59]Here are your 20 tokens, kiddo.
[322:53.29]And then, like, my brother, oh, here you go, here's your 20 tokens.
[322:56.67]And then, like, my mother would kind of be like, oh, and don't forget about him, too.
[323:00.78]Oh, he's got, and he would kind of look, he would look at the card and be like, oh, yeah, of course, of course you're going to get 20 free tokens.
[323:09.00]If you're that guy, you can't be like, no, sorry, dumb kids don't get tokens.
[323:13.62]Yeah, sorry, idiots don't get anything.
[323:15.52]Yeah.
[323:16.94]Why don't you try a little harder?
[323:20.32]And I thought my report card was good.
[323:24.14]I was like, yeah, I did good in school.
[323:25.72]I got free tokens.
[323:28.72]All the while, my poor mother's probably just like, god damn.
[323:33.54]We had to like lump him in with the other kids.
[323:37.32]Oh, fuck.
[323:41.90]Hey, you coming?
[323:44.40]I mean, I'm not the brightest bulb.
[323:46.94]But I have a lot of power, okay?
[323:49.12]I may not be the brightest bulb, but I last a long time.
[323:53.23]And I'll never let you down.
[323:55.32]I'll always turn on.
[324:03.38]You coming?
[324:04.40]I'm trying to climb to the top of this thing.
[324:05.88]There's nothing at the top.
[324:07.00]There was absolutely nothing up there.
[324:08.68]Catch me.
[324:10.24]Okay.
[324:12.38]I'm fine.
[324:13.50]Wow, you're wearing like cool guy clothes.
[324:16.74]Oh, you can put your gear on.
[324:17.72]You have to turn it on.
[324:19.32]I got to turn on my gear?
[324:20.30]You actually have to go into your equipment menu.
[324:22.28]I know, but I didn't get any gear.
[324:23.72]You don't have anything?
[324:25.50]I mean, I'm wearing a roadie vest.
[324:28.48]I guess I have this quarterback.
[324:30.14]Okay.
[324:30.74]That's a quarterback jersey.
[324:34.07]You said you're not an only child.
[324:35.27]There are more of you.
[324:39.59]I have a family.
[324:41.01]It's not like we're not all me walking around.
[324:46.92]Oh, thank God.
[324:47.48]I finally can get this.
[324:52.65]Yeah, I don't like eat food after midnight and like have gremlins come off my back Wouldn't that be like cool though?
[325:19.78]Don't feed him after midnight
[325:22.97]Don't feed him McDonald's after midnight.
[325:35.72]You see, like, this is stupid right now, isn't it?
[325:38.00]Well, we need to make a choice.
[325:40.10]Sophie was cooler.
[325:41.30]I have to go.
[325:41.96]Okay.
[325:42.68]What I'm saying, like, we're knocking on the front door.
[325:45.14]Hey, can you let me in?
[325:46.02]Like, wouldn't it be so much better if you just had a homie hole?
[325:51.30]uh yeah that's cool you just have a hole opening up to the outside of your house no it has a flap like a dog door that's fine but anybody can just go through it so that's fine and you and you wake up one morning and like your PS5 is gone and so is your TV okay you're like just open side of your house is cool until um until the PS5 is gone you can't like lock that you you you couldn't lock it you're talking about putting a bike lock on a PS5
[326:21.22]no on the door flap there's no conceivable way that you could prevent someone from crawling in from the outside I mean yeah it's called a door with a lock on it the door has a lock on it and also you can like slide down a covering for the homie hole like I'm not expecting any homies today so you lock you close it so why don't you just have a door to your house
[326:51.08]I would have it open as often as possible.
[326:54.84]Would you have the front door to your house open?
[326:57.83]All day?
[326:59.99]Uh, yeah.
[327:00.77]Okay, well then never mind.
[327:02.21]Do you like just not trust people?
[327:03.45]You just failed that, by the way.
[327:05.59]Let a real lockpick over here, please.
[327:07.27]You're the lockpick guy, so I backed up.
[327:14.52]Ooh, nice.
[327:15.00]That said nerd stick.
[327:19.54]What is that?
[327:24.15]also can I ask what is every game has these doors that look like they're like sliding doors that come down that are like this is the locked line door yeah why because it's to convey that you cannot go through here because there's nothing to open but these kinds of doors don't exist yeah they do only in hotel rooms and then you get embarrassed taking a in that room because it actually doesn't even close
[327:53.42]It's like sliding like a closet door closed and you're like, I don't want to take a shit in here.
[327:57.26]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[327:59.66]The only time I've ever seen a sliding door like that was in a hotel bathroom.
[328:02.56]Okay.
[328:14.89]Those doors fucking suck.
[328:16.03]Yeah.
[328:16.45]And in between all the question marks, somebody understands what I'm saying.
[328:20.55]Where did you go?
[328:23.70]Uh, I don't know what we're supposed to be doing.
[328:28.98]The roof?
[328:33.77]I swear to God, I'm fucking, I think I'm done.
[328:38.71]What?
[328:39.31]I fell off.
[328:46.59]I think you're done.
[328:48.77]No, I'm not.
[328:53.74]I have to climb up there from a different place.
[328:57.24]He fell off.
[328:57.76]L ratio.
[328:59.52]Yeah.
[328:59.98]Okay.
[329:01.86]What the?
[329:05.06]I was just as confused as you were.
[329:06.74]We have to go in the house.
[329:08.38]I needed another tutorial.
[329:16.78]Why don't you just climb the rope?
[329:20.18]Can I get up there from here?
[329:22.82]I don't know where... I'm on like an obstacle course someone set up.
[329:27.36]I can't get up to the building again.
[329:36.43]Where does this go?
[329:37.21]What is the point?
[329:38.07]Who am I?
[329:39.09]What's my motivation?
[329:44.42]Can I climb on that?
[329:50.92]I'm kind of lost.
[329:58.74]I need to do the obstacle course.
[330:00.50]Yeah, you know, I gotta find a way back over here.
[330:06.44]A yellow blind streamer?
[330:13.70]I'm super blind.
[330:17.40]I can't take that.
[330:18.44]Like, I think I was supposed to go there, but it didn't seem like I was going to make it.
[330:23.72]It's barbed wire here.
[330:30.21]What?
[330:33.49]We're both like equally lost right now.
[330:36.25]Oh.
[330:38.89]Well, I won it.
[330:41.31]Ladder.
[330:41.53]I'm dead.
[330:44.69]What do you mean dead?
[330:46.09]I died.
[330:48.81]How do I get up there?
[331:02.85]Oh, there's uh, there's an inhibitor container.
[331:04.33]Ahhhhhhhhhh.
[331:10.82]What the fuck?
[331:12.80]Where are you?
[331:13.62]What?
[331:16.75]Why did that happen?
[331:22.73]Where the fuck are you?
[331:23.75]I'm trying to climb up on this thing.
[331:31.89]Oh, good.
[331:32.51]We're all caught up.
[331:33.96]Why does that keep... What's going on with this?
[331:44.94]Can you help?
[331:47.99]How do I get up there?
[331:48.97]I'm helping.
[331:53.61]I have to go through the house?
[331:59.65]Open up the hole that you have.
[332:05.78]I think the stick launches you.
[332:07.26]That'd be kind of crazy.
[332:14.28]Do I have to go through the house?
[332:15.22]Oh, I'm just going to let him do it.
[332:17.48]I mean, there's an inhibitor here and you can't teleport to me.
[332:20.16]Fuck.
[332:20.64]Okay.
[332:21.06]I need to get up there.
[332:21.66]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[332:22.92]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[332:24.02]Teleport, teleport, teleport, teleport, teleport, teleport, teleport, teleport, teleport.

[332:36.77]Large fry.

[332:40.57]The time just kind of flies when you're having a good time.
[332:44.13]Come back here.
[332:44.76]Other way, gas can.
[332:50.52]Oh, don't touch that.
[332:54.84]Yo, inhibit this.
[332:58.66]Alright.
[332:59.47]I'm going to do stamina again.
[333:01.69]Hey, man, do you like berries?
[333:05.51]Not really.
[333:06.31]I'm honest.
[333:07.41]Yeah, bury this dick in your mouth.
[333:14.45]There's other questions over here.
[333:20.74]You're on thin ice.
[333:22.56]You're on thin ice.
[333:23.16]Thin ice.
[333:36.05]Why do we do that when we stretch?
[333:37.15]To alert the horde.
[333:41.79]You just censored that.
[333:44.11]He went, oh, shit.
[333:47.26]You just actually censored him.
[333:49.06]You betrayed us.
[333:50.98]And now we have to kill you.
[333:53.48]Helped Ator and yourself.
[333:55.18]Helping us was just a byproduct.
[333:57.54]What are you waiting for?
[333:59.73]Wait, does everyone betray us?
[334:01.09]Like, literally everyone?
[334:02.11]And we keep being like, wait, like, we have to fight your goons now?
[334:07.17]Oh, no.
[334:07.85]Bandits!
[334:08.49]Wow.
[334:08.99]Do it.
[334:11.55]Do it.
[334:22.24]These guys are still level one.
[334:26.10]Oh, my God.
[334:26.76]Yeah.
[334:27.00]Why are they all one?
[334:38.30]He's dead, dude.
[334:42.10]So now we have to chase him.
[334:43.12]Throw him up against a wall and be like, what do you know?
[334:48.49]I don't know anything.
[334:49.49]Where's Mia?
[334:50.57]He's going to have a detonator in his hand.
[334:52.07]He's going to have a fucking detonator in his hand.
[334:57.38]There's a bunch of chamomile out here.
[334:59.72]I press this button and we all go kaboom.
[335:11.33]I think I got all the stuff.
[335:20.44]There's a lot of stuff up here.
[335:21.78]I mean, if you're into looting, kind of like a looter shooter kind of situation.
[335:27.29]Why don't I just throw that?
[335:27.97]Is that a brick?
[335:29.91]Oh my god, it's a brick.
[335:32.77]Oh my god, there's a brick in the game.
[335:33.85]No!
[335:34.91]I want that back.
[335:42.78]Okay, do you think that a brick is like the perfect comedy weapon?
[335:49.76]Yeah.
[335:50.46]Something about it.
[335:51.04]It's funny.
[335:53.30]I was going to say like, oh, yeah, brick.
[335:56.70]Like throwing a brick at somebody is just like, it's such a dense rectangle object.
[336:05.26]It's kind of like it was made for hitting people in the head with.
[336:09.08]There's someone at that door.
[336:12.21]where this guy's just standing on the other side of this door use your your hunter vision you see that guy no you don't feel like a red outline that's scary yeah what do you think he wants I don't know you figures

[336:48.66]We skipped the whole thing.
[336:49.56]Here comes the boss battle music.
[336:53.46]I turned music down.
[336:54.67]I can't even tell what it sounds like.
[336:58.33]There's not really anything.
[337:19.62]Keep him off me for a second.
[337:28.37]Aww.
[337:29.07]You gotta have a black eye.
[337:31.53]That means he's almost dead.
[337:51.45]Oh, he's blinkin'.
[337:52.01]He's blinkin'.
[337:52.73]He's blinkin'.
[337:54.54]Is that a Family Guy joke?
[337:57.84]Did I steal that from Family Guy?
[337:58.68]He does have the black eye.
[337:59.60]What?
[337:59.98]I don't know what the joke is.
[338:01.84]Like, nothing about it sounded funny, so maybe it was from Family Guy.
[338:06.82]Fuck.
[338:07.26]That's a Family Guy joke, it is.
[338:08.22]Damn.

[339:45.35]Something.
[339:45.93]Be careful.
[339:47.37]I always knew we could count on Carlos.
[339:57.36]Okay, you can't hit yourself in the head with a brick.
[340:08.45]Okay, um... The honey.
[340:13.95]By the way, how are you doing?
[340:15.89]You okay?
[340:16.77]You good?
[340:18.11]I don't know.
[340:18.43]I don't feel so well.
[340:20.03]I mean, it's been about six hours.
[340:21.37]You alright?
[340:21.87]You want to keep going?
[340:22.61]You want to stop?
[340:23.33]How do you feel?
[340:24.85]I'm not feeling so good.
[340:27.89]Okay.
[340:30.64]I can keep going.
[340:31.44]Okay.
[340:31.66]We can keep going.
[340:37.68]All players are required to go in this door.
[340:40.54]Oh.
[340:41.63]Where the hell are you?
[340:42.47]Oh, you're in the gas can room.
[340:44.09]Have you reached a thousand of your experience bar for rating the game?
[340:48.08]Um, we're definitely still in just the fifth tutorial.
[340:51.88]If you ask nicely, I'll shoot you in the head.
[340:53.26]Yeah.
[340:53.94]And if not, you'll spend a long time dying until you turn.
[340:56.72]So... You'll be the one dying, Barney.
[340:59.41]No, you!
[341:00.81]Not kill him.
[341:02.85]Give me the weapon.
[341:04.21]Give it to me, brother.
[341:05.27]Hope you know what you're doing.
[341:09.39]This is the thanks I get for everything.
[341:10.99]What?
[341:11.63]I don't know.
[341:12.40]What?
[341:12.62]You didn't say you were working for Ader.
[341:14.26]I don't work for Ader.
[341:15.14]I work for myself.
[341:17.09]What are you laughing at?
[341:18.03]You're just a funny guy.
[341:19.91]What?
[341:46.40]Try me.
[341:47.80]Yeah, try me.
[341:50.41]You could try, but I don't think you will.
[341:53.61]Tell me who killed Lucas.
[341:54.57]Who are these people?
[341:55.43]The moron thinks we did it.
[341:56.83]Waste of time.
[341:58.09]Shoot.
[341:58.35]This is your last chance, Sophie.
[342:00.39]Tell me who killed Lucas before I break down this door.
[342:02.85]What are you, Donkey Kong?
[342:03.95]This just made it a steal.
[342:05.39]This does remind me of my favorite scene ever from one of my favorite shows of all time.
[342:10.82]The crazy new adventures of... I can't breathe.
[342:15.87]I tried to stall what sabrina the teenage witch he has the new show my favorite scene of all time and all television ever is what happens yes
[342:29.12]Oh man, she like, she just acts like she's so incredible all the time and she just walks into rooms and solves the problems instantly.
[342:36.80]But there's one part of the show where she walks into this room and is like, I'm here.
[342:40.11]Sabrina's gonna stop.
[342:41.13]And they just instantly cut to her getting shot with a crossbow and like the people just don't listen to her.
[342:46.21]What?
[342:46.81]It's my absolute favorite thing.
[342:52.29]That's kind of funny.
[342:53.65]Yeah.
[342:55.39]It is.
[342:56.03]It's very, very comedic timing.
[342:59.21]What the hell?
[342:59.81]You are supposed to launch off of it.
[343:01.27]Chat was right.
[343:01.85]I thought they were bullshitting me.
[343:04.25]Yeah, you have to jump off of it.
[343:08.28]Is that in the Olympics?
[343:11.12]Pole vaulting?
[343:15.06]Okay, if I type in like... What did you say the show was?
[343:20.59]Whatever the new Sabrina the Teenage Witch is.
[343:22.69]Where she's like hip and edgy on Netflix.
[343:24.37]Sabrina the Teenage Witch crossbow.
[343:27.25]maybe you'll find it I find it if you find it I it's one of those things I like rewatch like 10 times in a row but it really helps when you have the build up of like how this has gone in her favor for like three seasons oh I I can't I don't I can't find it I'll try and find it one day if you can find it uh I'd love to see your favorite joke of all time
[343:54.17]I build it up, it's going to be a huge letdown.
[343:55.91]You know how the situation goes.
[344:00.35]I don't think so.
[344:03.61]I can't.
[344:04.03]Something about this game means that I can't click anything on my other monitors, even when they're active.
[344:10.41]What's wrong with my body?
[344:13.63]Oh, the chase has started.
[344:15.55]What the fuck?
[344:18.83]Is this a zombie merchant?
[344:20.27]What the fuck?
[344:21.07]Get off of me.
[344:25.19]Climb!
[344:25.47]Hurry!
[344:27.24]Chat found it?
[344:28.60]Yeah, I'm sure they googled Sabrina Crossbow and found it.
[344:31.18]That's what I did.
[344:31.80]I couldn't find it.
[344:34.41]I mean, you wouldn't know.
[344:36.45]I'm really far away from you.
[344:37.81]That's not one of those... I'm dead.
[344:40.61]That was seriously the same exact color scheme as all this shit.
[344:45.05]It's blue and white.
[344:46.49]And it was like, look, blue and white on this plank of wood.
[344:49.97]That was not my fault.
[344:51.73]Where are you?
[344:52.61]I'm dead over here.
[344:54.13]That really did look like it was one of those things.
[345:00.48]Oh, you jumped and... Okay, you're dead.
[345:02.38]Yeah, but it looked like it was one of those safe X thingies, blue and white...
[345:09.24]We found it.
[345:09.54]It's the first 30 seconds of this right here.
[345:15.72]Oh, I think somebody's got it.
[345:16.54]Should I watch?
[345:21.10]Should we watch this on stream?
[345:23.26]Yeah, let's go for it.
[345:24.03]So this is the funniest thing you've ever seen, you said, right?
[345:29.07]It's not the funniest thing.
[345:30.23]It's just my favorite thing from TV.
[345:33.43]Well, okay, that's not fair.
[345:34.91]It's like my favorite thing that I don't think was supposed to be funny.
[345:38.99]I'm gonna add a whole bunch of qualifiers as I remember that like Always Sunny exists and there's actually like funny TV shows.
[345:46.13]Hold on.
[345:52.56]We're about to watch it on my stream if you want to come over and you can give some commentary if you want.
[345:59.28]It needs the context, man.
[346:03.74]So I'm at like 15 seconds or so.
[346:08.37]I don't know if this is like a spoiler for Sabrina the Teenage Witch.
[346:11.02]It probably is.
[346:12.10]Would you call this a spoiler?
[346:16.36]As long as you... It's not a spoiler as long as you stop watching after she gets shot.
[346:20.96]Okay.
[346:22.84]Alright, so this is it right here.
[346:25.15]Are you ready?
[346:29.41]I can't click on anything on my computer.
[346:31.27]Okay.
[346:42.09]It was before that?
[346:48.32]I spoiled it.
[346:50.26]Oh shit.
[346:56.91]I mean, is that the funniest thing you've ever seen?
[346:59.75]It's up there.
[347:14.78]I didn't even know what Sabrina even looked like.
[347:17.10]I thought that was another character.
[347:21.73]And see, look.
[347:22.55]White, blue.
[347:23.39]White, blue.
[347:24.03]The thing that I jumped on was white, blue.
[347:25.73]Alright, are you... Where are you?
[347:32.47]I, like, ran all the way to a safe house.
[347:35.94]What a wuss.
[347:45.46]I'm telling you, you didn't see the, like, two seasons before that where she shows up and every problem is solved because she's Sabrina.
[347:52.21]She literally just fucking gets shot and dies.
[347:55.77]Is it a good show?
[347:56.43]I guess you've watched through two full seasons of this show.
[347:59.39]Is it good?
[348:00.29]I've seen it all.
[348:02.01]I think we're going to get married.
[348:04.94]Is the show a good show?
[348:11.42]I, like, can't say yes, but I love how fucking dumb it can be.
[348:18.52]Like, I, like, love it as a basically video candidate, pretty much.
[348:23.29]Really?
[348:23.59]Like, that style of love it, yeah.
[348:25.45]Really?
[348:25.97]Okay.
[348:27.13]There's one episode that I don't even, like, describing it is going to be too much.
[348:33.01]We potentially see another basically on this show?
[348:38.63]I have a basically half-made still.
[348:41.15]Oh.
[348:41.25]Did I ever show it to you?
[348:42.41]I think you did.
[348:42.91]I need to finish that.
[348:45.35]It's a good one.
[348:46.95]I need to actually finish it.
[348:48.85]Yeah, you have to.
[348:49.79]It's been like a year of it being half done.
[348:52.39]Alright, so we're safe here.
[348:57.14]Yeah, we're safe.
[348:59.38]Get the honey and stuff out here.
[349:03.50]It's everywhere.
[349:07.33]Somebody asked, does Ster like anything unironically?
[349:09.51]Diablo II.
[349:11.19]Diablo II, Bloodborne.
[349:12.33]I love a lot of things.
[349:13.32]I just think it's boring to describe things you like.
[349:15.82]You, Burger.
[349:17.56]Yeah, that's alright.
[349:18.48]I'm not too into burgers anymore.
[349:20.74]Are you?
[349:21.04]Do you not?
[349:21.52]Let me ask you something.
[349:22.40]Do you not like to talk about things you like because you don't want to seem like, like, oh, you don't want to, like, tell people how cool something is and then they don't like it?
[349:31.25]No I just legitimately think it's kind of boring.
[349:33.78]And it's much more interesting to like analyze things and like analyzing something you like is like no I like that it's- that's just- that's all it is, that's like the whole conversation.
[349:42.78]And everyone's like oh you don't like any games, all I ever hear is you don't like this.
[349:45.78]Like Slay the Spire for me is like a 10 out of 10, brilliant game. But I'm not- I don't like-
[349:51.00]Okay put the spear down. Put the spear down, I get it.
[349:53.00]Why do I gotta put the spear down.
[349:54.50]Jesus.
[349:55.00]You coming at me?
[349:59.64]Somebody said he wants rage clicks.
[350:03.80]I'm getting them, definitely.
[350:05.62]It's working for me.
[350:07.94]No, I think I can understand that in a way.
[350:10.90]Like, okay, I like this.
[350:13.64]It's like, you like it, right?
[350:15.06]But then what more is there to say?
[350:16.72]Back in the day, we could talk about, like, all the weird shit within Smite, or I could go on for a long time about, like, Overwatch is fucking weird.
[350:23.86]But, like, Slay the Spy, it's just a perfect, great game.
[350:27.38]Just play it.
[350:30.35]Okay.
[350:30.85]I mean, I played Slay the Spire.
[350:33.39]Good game, right?
[350:33.91]We can do this thing.
[350:34.45]We can do this thing.
[350:36.09]Don't do it.
[350:39.33]It was good.
[350:42.26]Doing the math in my head kind of was hard.
[350:44.02]And I was like, this is fun, but it's not for me.
[350:51.42]Yeah, math is like that.
[350:52.53]I thought it was a good game, though.
[350:56.07]It was definitely really cool.
[350:57.92]You coming?
[350:58.26]We're getting them?
[350:58.82]Let's go.
[350:59.38]I think we're going to try to get them.
[351:04.32]I think we're going to blow up.
[351:05.38]Alright.
[351:09.90]So, we got a lot of explosives here.
[351:12.66]A lot of explosives.
[351:19.31]He jumped.
[351:21.33]He's the jumper.
[351:21.93]I'm going to throw an explosive.
[351:28.53]I got him.
[351:29.75]Watch out.
[351:30.27]I'm killing him.
[351:30.91]I throw that at you, essentially.
[351:32.07]Be careful.
[351:33.39]Oh, we got a whole bunch of Zeds.
[351:34.23]I don't know where they came from.
[351:38.67]They're here.
[351:41.84]Hey.
[351:47.84]Wouldn't it be great if IGN game reviews were like that?
[351:51.37]It's great!
[351:52.21]And then the reviews over.
[351:55.15]This is no review.
[351:57.37]Game was really fun.
[351:58.59]We really liked it.
[351:59.49]Did that distract you?
[352:08.36]Distract me?
[352:09.68]I'm trying to distract him.
[352:11.70]Oh.
[352:12.60]I see.
[352:20.43]Alright.
[352:20.91]He... Stop running around so much.
[352:34.30]Oh, I poisoned him!
[352:36.70]Oh, I'm gonna... I'm about to throw a boomerang.
[352:39.24]Alright, do it.
[352:39.98]I'm out.
[352:40.34]I'm out.
[352:43.72]I'm out.
[352:45.04]Oh.
[352:45.78]He did a bit of a jumpy.
[352:49.89]Dead.
[352:50.09]Dead.
[352:50.33]Yeah, the only good Zed's a dead Zed.
[352:55.65]Old world wine.
[353:05.28]Bro.
[353:05.68]You played Dark Messiah, right?
[353:07.16]I did.
[353:08.40]Yeah, good game.
[353:09.26]End of conversation.
[353:10.00]Alright, but you can describe why something was good without just saying it was good.
[353:17.12]I don't know if it's really worth it.
[353:18.42]Well, because what if somebody's like, well, why do you say that?
[353:22.72]Okay, what if somebody disagrees with you that I don't think that game is good?
[353:27.19]No one disagrees with me.
[353:28.41]Like, when we brought up, like, best games of all time, Diablo II Bloodborne, like, we both just agree.
[353:33.31]It's very, very obvious that we're both correct in this instance, and same for Dark Messiah.
[353:37.57]Well, what if somebody said, Dark Messiah, that game sucks?
[353:39.39]What would you say?
[353:42.50]Kind of a weird opinion to just be, like, totally and completely wrong.
[353:45.73]Okay, so they're gonna go, why am I wrong?
[353:47.33]Yeah, it's a bad game.
[353:48.63]It's, like, stupid.
[353:49.13]You fight orcs?
[353:50.01]Who cares?
[353:50.69]Like, Peter Jackson did that fucking 100 years ago.
[353:52.34]I don't even know who Peter Jackson is.
[353:55.60]Like, do you, like, explain why you like something?
[353:59.86]Well, see, this whole scenario, like, that doesn't bother me that they don't like it.
[354:06.16]You're like, oh, like, what if I told you, like, I disagreed and I, like, don't like, like, okay.
[354:13.59]I'm upgrading my health.
[354:15.36]Someone comes and says, oh, Bloodborne, oh, that game fucking, all the Souls games are the same.
[354:19.04]Alright, I mean, I could... Not wrong.
[354:23.09]Hmm.
[354:24.23]Interesting.
[354:25.81]Very interesting.
[354:26.43]I think I want to test this theory.
[354:29.39]Okay.
[354:32.51]So, if somebody told you that I don't like Dark Messiah and you are stupid for liking it.
[354:40.31]Stupid for liking it?
[354:41.25]Like, you're an idiot.
[354:42.43]Like, you like that game because you're dumb.
[354:45.24]Now it becomes a personal attack.
[354:46.92]Do you defend yourself then?
[354:49.00]No.
[354:49.25]You don't?
[354:50.21]I mean, like, that's just such a fucking weird person where, like, the person is basing intelligence level of other people on video game preferences and it's just a weirdo.
[355:03.43]so you don't deny that you're stupid like surely I'm not I'm I am I could have a potential conversation about like oh yeah like I could tell you why I like it but it's like I don't know it's not that's not an engaging conversation for me I'd rather talk about something like engaging and divisive like hillary's email like what's up I don't know we're all just agreeing dark messiah is an amazing game
[355:33.17]but yeah it is alright what do we need to turn in here that health upgrade was ass by the way I I don't even know that I did it it's like plus one percent health it looks like I've just been taking the stamina and even the stamina is not I guess I don't know
[355:58.94]I took this weird upgrade and now if I press my sprint button, I lose half of my stamina and I don't go any faster.
[356:05.18]Oh, that's right.
[356:06.10]I got that too.
[356:06.79]I'm not pressing sprint though.
[356:10.65]Did you get the ledge launch one?
[356:12.91]That one's kind of ridiculous, but I keep forgetting to do it.
[356:15.45]Yeah, me too.
[356:16.51]You turn into like Spider-Man.
[356:18.17]You ever play Prototype?
[356:20.14]No, actually.
[356:21.34]I wanted to.
[356:22.48]That's a really, really good game.
[356:24.61]I tried to stream that game.
[356:26.61]Really?
[356:27.39]Yeah.
[356:28.45]What happened?
[356:29.61]The game ran like shit and it was like all messed up.
[356:31.99]The frame rate was fucked up, everything.
[356:37.10]What did you play on?
[356:38.24]I think it was PC.
[356:40.08]Who the fuck is this guy?
[356:41.66]We're being chased.
[356:42.38]We gotta move.
[356:48.06]I think they had it for sale on like PlayStation, like a bundle of the old game.
[356:53.04]I tried to screen record it.
[356:54.30]I tried to capture it, but it was all messed up.
[356:56.00]Yeah, people are saying it doesn't work well on PC.
[356:59.84]But there's a whole bunch of games I played in the last year.
[357:01.78]I'm like this.
[357:02.88]I'm not having fun.
[357:04.00]This really feels like I should be playing prototype.
[357:07.25]I can see that.
[357:11.21]I don't think I can make this jump.
[357:16.77]Did you try?
[357:19.27]I didn't realize there was an edge there.
[357:21.85]I almost just did it.
[357:24.41]Get off me.
[357:28.26]Get up.
[357:29.52]Get up.
[357:33.20]Ster just made me buy Slay the Spyro on my phone.
[357:36.90]Good choice.
[357:38.06]It's good.
[357:39.32]Get influenced.
[357:40.30]Maybe I should tell people things I like more and then they buy them and then it didn't really matter.
[357:46.45]I want to loot this place.
[357:47.43]Are you playing Hearthstone still?
[357:51.27]I saw you play it recently.
[357:54.77]I tried when they added like a new game mode thing to it.
[358:01.26]Not good?
[358:02.20]I like watch people play Battlegrounds on the twitch.tv if you've heard this Twitch platform.
[358:06.68]Yeah.
[358:07.34]I like playing it.
[358:07.98]I kind of really don't care anymore.
[358:09.66]And definitely not like standard.
[358:12.38]No, I watch Crypt too.
[358:16.40]I didn't say crip.
[358:17.64]That's who you were talking about.
[358:18.92]It's not who I was talking about.
[358:20.12]Are you kidding me?
[358:24.70]Okay.
[358:24.90]Crip the PoE streamer.
[358:29.20]I'm shocked.
[358:31.79]I'm shocked that you're not watching for Perrin.
[358:34.13]Like for Hearthstone and PoE.
[358:35.27]I legitimately don't.
[358:36.61]I mean like sometimes, but I don't stay up that late at night.
[358:39.61]Okay.
[358:39.99]Alright.
[358:40.29]Alright.
[358:40.73]Alright.
[358:41.09]Good.
[358:41.85]Good answer.
[358:42.73]You're safe.
[358:44.38]I can't get in this fucking window.
[358:45.84]I'm so pissed.
[358:47.50]Oh my god.
[358:48.42]Get in the window.
[358:52.71]Why won't go in the window?
[359:01.97]What is happening?
[359:03.99]Come on.
[359:05.99]He's pretending, right?
[359:07.49]No, I'm not pretending.
[359:09.19]I can't go in.
[359:10.35]You can't get in the homie hole.
[359:11.47]Okay, there you go.
[359:12.77]Oh, we got a nighttime bonus.
[359:21.74]So exhausting pretending this much.
[359:28.00]Alright, cool.
[359:29.74]We made it.
[359:30.36]I need to craft some stuff.
[359:31.26]Give me a sec.
[359:33.65]Okay.
[359:37.91]Can you make these regeneration boosters?
[359:41.09]That seems kind of... I wonder what a small amount of health is.
[359:48.05]40.
[359:48.27]Maybe it's not worth doing.
[359:51.49]40.
[359:51.51]2% per second.
[359:52.61]I'm going to go with what I know.
[359:59.09]Because I did upgrade these.
[360:01.40]I could do one.
[360:06.80]I'll get a few.
[360:09.36]Molotov.
[360:10.18]Yep.
[360:19.67]120% total.
[360:20.68]How is that a small amount of health?
[360:23.70]Wait.
[360:25.08]Wait, what?
[360:26.38]Okay, this is a 60 second duration and it regens 2% health per second.
[360:32.10]So it regens 120% of your health.
[360:35.17]How is that a small amount of health?
[360:40.61]I don't know.
[360:42.27]I didn't make it.
[360:44.65]I don't know.
[360:45.31]Who are you?
[360:45.79]I got a combat skill.
[360:50.22]What kind of cool about that gets smaller over 2% is small.
[360:58.76]You know how percentages work.
[361:02.96]It regents 2% of your health every second.
[361:07.38]And it lasts for 60 seconds.
[361:09.88]My How am I reading this wrong?
[361:24.71]2% gets smaller every time.
[361:27.98]Oh, because it's 2% of the current health that you're missing?
[361:31.54]I don't know.
[361:40.40]Yeah, and 2% is the small.
[361:41.40]You dunce.
[361:42.14]You don't have to call me a dunce.
[361:43.98]I did not.
[361:44.77]I'm not talking to you.
[361:45.93]I did not.
[361:46.71]I did not.
[361:48.87]Alright, you ready?
[361:50.65]Ready for what?
[361:52.97]Super Bowl?
[361:53.69]I got a bunch of molotovs.
[361:54.59]Super Bowl over, who won?
[361:58.85]We're going this way.
[361:59.74]We're going this way, 200.
[362:00.34]Oh my god, why?
[362:19.07]What?
[362:19.53]The cost of stamina...
[362:21.83]from things is really weird like exiting that pole ate all my stamina but holding on to the pole probably gets better over time yeah I bet so where are we heading now just to the marker
[362:46.52]Oh, yeah, I think we go in here and we tell the guys that we're, like, cool and people are saying, like, these are the quests you want to do for these guys and, like, we're doing them.
[362:54.18]Oh, my God.
[362:56.59]Favorite Hearthstone card?
[362:58.91]Favorite Hearthstone card.
[363:04.53]For real?
[363:05.71]No.
[363:07.23]Okay.
[363:08.69]Just passing the time.
[363:12.26]I like, like, Tess Greymane.
[363:18.72]Somebody said I keep spacing out.
[363:20.48]Drink some water.
[363:22.10]Eat a banana.
[363:22.74]You're gonna laugh if he was just dead in your arms.
[363:25.26]That does seem to happen at the end of those.
[363:27.04]I think we got an item.
[363:44.47]Yeah, we got like a hammer.
[363:46.65]Thanks.
[363:47.85]Thanks for killing that like 100 people you've killed.
[363:50.47]Here's a hammer to do it some more scrapper has that we just got this thing is terrible.
[363:55.88]Yeah, it was like a level one because we're still in the tutorial even though I this game's pacing is bizarre.
[364:06.10]We just slow
[364:08.22]We're definitely slow.
[364:09.75]Yeah.
[364:10.39]But we also definitely had to play for like 40 minutes to even start the stream.
[364:14.83]That's true.
[364:18.78]And we were not pausing for McDonald's orders during that 45 to 50 minute intro.
[364:23.64]I speed ran my heart out and it was still kind of like... Well, it wasn't slow.
[364:27.86]It was fine.
[364:28.42]It was a good intro.
[364:30.21]But now it's like introing again that you're in the city.
[364:33.67]It's like going over the same stuff.
[364:36.65]That's a little bit like, you know, it kind of grinds my gears.
[364:40.89]You're going to get your $60 worth.
[364:41.76]Hayden.
[364:47.45]It looks like the bandits fled the water tower.
[364:49.39]It's unoccupied.
[364:50.89]Vader wants to take control of the water and force the bizarre folk to talk.
[364:54.44]You just started running, didn't you?
[364:55.96]Yeah.
[364:56.16]You were just gone.
[364:57.72]I thought you were following me, honestly.
[365:01.26]I was kind of in my inventory.
[365:02.34]I'm picking up all the lavender.
[365:04.34]I'm getting some honey from the bees.
[365:06.24]I'm not even worried about getting stung.
[365:08.14]The bees are no problem for me.
[365:09.71]I'm gonna pick up some of these shrooms.
[365:11.49]Doing a little bit of live commentary right now.
[365:13.11]I'm gonna search this guy real quick.
[365:15.85]The true question is, which came first?
[365:18.45]Ranch or cool ranch?
[365:21.64]Ranch, because then everything spun off of that.
[365:24.52]We got a whole bunch of blues over here.
[365:27.30]Like that.
[365:44.65]I'm fighting some Blues.
[365:46.21]Cool Ranch always sounds, like, so odd to me.
[365:49.98]Whenever I hear Cool Ranch, for some reason I think that it's got, like, Freon in it.
[365:53.72]I don't know what I'm doing.
[365:58.14]He's just bouncing her up.
[366:02.86]Well, you get, like, the chain kick combo where you parry someone, then you stun the next guy.
[366:07.83]But it's very awkward.
[366:21.54]Oh no!
[366:22.86]Bandits!
[366:31.30]Can I craft something new?
[366:32.18]Oh, we're going this way.
[366:39.63]Come on, Timmy.
[366:39.93]Did we ever play the car DLC from Dying Light 1?
[366:43.11]I don't think so.
[366:44.29]I tried to play some of it on my own, but we did not play it.
[366:54.62]Secret over there?
[366:56.42]Any secrets over here?
[367:03.01]I really just can't get over how good this game looks.
[367:06.23]I can't get over it.
[367:12.14]I always turn all this shit off when I play these games.
[367:15.95]I go to the checkboxes, and I turn off bloom, refractoring lighting, shadows, like I turn it all off.
[367:22.10]Oh, so you got like a monster rig, man.
[367:24.10]What are those, what are those specs?
[367:25.66]Tell me about your monster fucking rig, man.
[367:28.42]Alright, let me crack my fingers here.
[367:30.68]Alright, you wanna hear?
[367:31.26]Yeah, let's get it.
[367:33.69]So, my rig.
[367:34.95]What happened?
[367:36.97]Did we just explode?
[367:38.27]Did I?
[367:40.51]What'd you do?
[367:40.93]Did I do that?
[367:44.57]Should we respond to the last story point?
[367:52.72]What happened?
[367:55.86]You see this giant pile of explosives?
[367:59.14]I swung on it.
[368:00.70]What does it do?
[368:06.19]What does it do?
[368:07.19]I wanted to see the funny thing too.
[368:10.71]On my screen, I never actually hit it.
[368:12.29]Like, the swing never finished.
[368:14.01]I was like, oh, did I?
[368:16.27]Dude, you gotta do this.
[368:17.07]Dude, you gotta do this.
[368:17.87]They're gonna blow it up.
[368:20.77]That's, like, kind of realistic, though, isn't it?
[368:22.89]Like, we wouldn't see the explosion.
[368:24.41]We're just gone.
[368:25.21]Oh, yeah, I didn't like The Sopranos ending.
[368:28.15]Don't talk about spoilers!
[368:30.85]Who hasn't seen The Sopranos that cares?
[368:39.72]Because if you exploded like that, it would just be like, gone.
[368:43.77]It wouldn't be like, boom, oh my explosion.
[368:46.95]Final scene in Sopranos when he walks up to the fucking, the propane tank and he punches it and it just ends.
[368:54.48]This is really weird.
[369:07.82]Hold on, that was really funny.
[369:14.72]I just see Tony Soprano, like, at the end of the movie, at the end of the show, just being like, it's fucking stupid.
[369:19.70]Fuck you, fuck this, you fucking- Boom!
[369:21.78]It's over.
[369:23.62]Credits.
[369:25.76]Fucking propane.
[369:26.58]Oh, you don't think I fuck with you?
[369:27.39]You think you're funny?
[369:28.03]Fucking propane?
[369:30.49]Honestly, if I'm in control of any production or anything ever, like, that's how it's gonna end.
[369:35.05]Something like that dumb.
[369:37.24]My fucking head.
[369:38.60]How could you resist?
[369:40.94]Ending it with the person, like, punching a propane tank?
[369:46.00]Yeah, like, just, like, sometimes shit happens.
[369:52.68]Oh, okay.
[369:55.99]Not everything in life is, like, planned in a script room, you know?
[369:58.99]Sometimes someone just fucking...
[370:05.22]Hey, let me tell you something.
[370:12.98]I got something to fucking tell you.
[370:15.47]Oh, fuck you.
[370:17.35]Oh, come on.
[370:17.85]It didn't happen immediately.
[370:20.89]Yeah, that's like the like you can see me do it.
[370:23.45]But when you do it yourself, it kind of stops early.
[370:25.47]It does.
[370:25.95]Alright.
[370:26.58]Alright.
[370:27.02]Alright.
[370:27.54]Alright.
[370:28.22]Stop it.
[370:32.78]It says quest failed on the credits.
[370:37.74]Oh, we gotta do this again?
[370:41.07]This fucking slime guy is spitting out the fucking slime.
[370:49.83]Where's the rest of it?
[370:51.77]Where's the rest?
[370:52.29]Oh.
[370:52.71]I think there's more.
[370:54.10]Find and disarm the explosives.
[370:55.50]Oh, yeah.
[370:56.38]There's a whole secret route up here.
[370:58.00]Any secrets over here?
[371:05.14]Oh, yeah, there's secrets up here.
[371:10.56]I just keep thinking of, like, Tony Soprano.
[371:12.32]He's got, like, a gun in his hand.
[371:13.58]There's, like, three or four other characters, and they're all just, like, arguing.
[371:18.57]Now that you think that that's funny, that Sabrina clip is that for me.
[371:24.05]Alright, I get it.
[371:28.87]there's so much build up and they're so there's no reason for her to just suddenly get shot by a crossbow in the show to end so like in my head cannon shows over there where's this other bomb I don't know I think we gotta there's some we gotta climb up here we gotta go in here and bombs don't swing on these don't swing on we're gonna have to climb again I'm not I'm not swinging
[371:53.35]We get it?
[371:54.69]Yeah.
[371:56.08]There's more.
[371:58.58]We need to go... We need to do up-ease, I think.
[372:00.40]Oh, from here.
[372:01.04]Yeah, inside.
[372:05.54]What is this place?
[372:07.64]Why does anyone care if it explodes?
[372:10.30]I don't know.
[372:11.03]It's an important building of some kind.
[372:13.19]The water tower, maybe?
[372:14.97]Where did you go?
[372:15.49]How did you get up there?
[372:17.09]Inside the building.
[372:18.81]Oh, right.
[372:21.83]They're in this room arguing.
[372:24.02]Tony Soprano's in here.
[372:25.64]I'm coming.
[372:30.72]Jack, shut the fuck up, you fucking idiot.
[372:33.91]Someone's gonna punch it.
[372:37.95]Alright, got it.
[372:41.79]Got it.
[372:43.57]And the water is safe.
[372:45.61]oh yeah it was a water tower I don't know why everyone's like worried about water most abundant resource and they're like oh climb to the top of the water tower I'm doing yeah we're doing some climbing I think I think you're right
[373:18.89]What the hell is that?
[373:20.15]That just reminded me of... Do you want to go in that cage?
[373:22.81]Do you remember Mr. Show?
[373:24.81]Mr. Who?
[373:25.65]Mr. Show.
[373:26.19]It was a show on HBO.
[373:27.32]It was Bob Odenkirk and David... No, I've never even heard of it.
[373:31.34]What's his name?
[373:32.12]David... My God, what's his name?
[373:33.94]David, David, David, David, David, David, David.
[373:36.90]I'm so stupid.
[373:37.58]David Cross.
[373:39.35]It's kind of like a sketch comedy show, and you want to talk about one of the funniest things that you've seen, which is the Sabrina thing?
[373:45.08]They did this bit where it was like The Sopranos
[373:49.60]But all of the violence and swears were edited out of the show, because it was for, like, network TV.
[373:54.69]It was like, and for the first time, we're airing, like, the Soprano family on ABC.
[374:02.67]And, dude, it was the funniest fucking goddamn thing.
[374:05.52]Like, every two seconds, it's just like, shut the fuck up.
[374:08.92]And then, like, somebody appears, like, face down at the table with, like, a gun wound, like...
[374:13.30]I gotta find it.
[374:13.88]They didn't mute it.
[374:14.74]They cut.
[374:15.49]Oh, it's the... We're doing a YouTube watch right here.
[374:18.69]Do you know the, like, Macho Man thing where every time he takes a breath, they cut?
[374:23.31]Yep.
[374:23.57]Or it's just... Mr. Show.
[374:28.13]Sopranos.
[374:29.20]What would it be called?
[374:31.22]Yeah, mobster movie edited for TV.
[374:34.34]Here it is.
[374:34.64]We're gonna watch this right now.
[374:36.30]This is absolutely fucking hysterical.
[374:37.88]This is very relevant.
[374:39.14]Hopefully I can click on it.
[374:41.14]Just open up my stream.
[374:45.64]Just watch.
[374:47.64]I know I have been unable to do anything on my computer.
[374:52.14]Oh, right.
[374:52.52]Right.
[374:52.68]Right.
[374:53.00]I think like if I all have if I end task, but not, you know, Windows, you know, I'm gone.
[374:59.98]Here we go.
[375:00.34]You're right.
[375:01.06]Okay, but you're gonna have to shut the fuck up.
[375:02.77]Alright, we have to do what to do at the same time.
[375:06.81]But you didn't link me anything.
[375:08.40]oh just type in Mr. show sopranos now I'm watching on your stream but you need to shut up and you need to not pause it react and then on you need to not do that I'm not going to do that I promise we're just going to watch it I don't believe you ready one two three oh thank you this is nice sauce thanks
[375:31.62]Wow.
[375:37.57]We buried his probably stinking up little horse by now.
[375:42.27]Hey, watch your mother father mouth.
[375:45.75]Don't you tell me what to do, you little piece of shoe.
[375:48.75]Hey, that's my aunt, you mother father.
[375:51.27]I'll show you what.
[375:56.74]Alright, I mean that was really funny, but not the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.
[376:27.23]That is Bob Odenkirk.
[376:28.81]Yes, that's Saul Goodman.
[376:33.23]Watch the Mad TV one, too.
[376:34.52]Yeah, that one's funny, too.
[376:35.36]They're all funny.
[376:37.46]Can you hear me?
[376:38.38]I can hear you.
[376:39.56]Yeah, everything locked up again.
[376:43.10]New Better Call Saul coming soon.
[376:45.48]I don't say anything.
[376:46.78]I haven't seen anything.
[376:48.22]I don't know if it's come out yet.
[376:51.59]I just remember hearing that it would be soon.
[376:55.61]Are you saying you haven't seen, like, anything?
[376:57.26]I haven't seen past season two, so don't say anything.
[377:01.56]What are you doing?
[377:03.00]I'm cron- What?
[377:05.86]Your turn.
[377:06.56]Okay.
[377:08.84]Ooh...
[377:22.63]Nice move, man.
[377:24.07]You really learned all your parkour.
[377:26.49]Thank you!
[377:26.77]Do you have any grenades?
[377:31.33]I... I do.
[377:35.05]Because I think we're about to fight one of the bosses of the game up here.
[377:39.56]You got a bit?
[377:40.98]I don't really have a bit.
[377:41.90]I'm just saying throw a grenade at him.
[377:44.66]Oh.
[377:45.32]Is that a... Oh, we gotta open this.
[377:48.30]Hey.
[377:49.44]Come down here.
[377:53.00]I'm on top of the... Hey.
[377:54.26]Hey, come down here where I am.
[377:55.70]I need you to open this plywood door.
[378:07.75]This is an important cutscene.
[378:09.03]We don't want to stop this one.
[378:11.77]Yeah, nice and easy.
[378:16.27]That's really heavy.
[378:17.18]Lots of stuff opens from the bottom in video games.
[378:19.72]Why?

[378:52.70]Wait, does he have the exploder in his hand?
[378:58.62]He does.
[378:59.12]He has the exploder in his hand.
[379:01.14]See?
[379:01.24]Called it.
[379:02.14]Oh, no.
[379:03.76]It's just a walkie-talkie.
[379:05.20]No.
[379:05.62]We don't trust anybody.
[379:10.14]What are they doing?
[379:11.34]Like a fucking improv show for us?
[379:13.08]Just fucking fight.
[379:14.02]You're going to start dancing?
[379:17.59]I won't help you.
[379:18.39]No, I won't help you.
[379:19.97]They're murderers.
[379:21.91]You want to be on their side?
[379:22.94]Look at them.
[379:23.24]They're wearing leather jackets.
[379:24.36]Get to the sides of the room immediately.
[379:25.76]That's a walkie-talkie.
[379:27.06]That's not a detonator.
[379:27.92]Oh, do my mouth.
[379:28.22]Get to the edges of the room.
[379:54.72]Did we get him?
[379:56.72]We got him.
[380:08.73]How?
[380:09.77]What?
[380:10.67]How?
[380:21.73]You just threw like $400 at him.
[380:23.63]That was like a grand.
[380:37.48]We both keep trying to do it.
[380:40.50]Are we going to land it?
[380:52.47]Oh my god!
[380:53.42]Why did you do that?
[380:56.74]I don't know.
[380:59.44]He was dead.
[381:04.42]Turn the water back on.
[381:05.32]He was already dead, man.
[381:11.47]it really was so stupid though back when movies would air on TV on network TV when you know Netflix hbo this nobody that doesn't exist it was they would put the stupidest in place of swears they would really do this oh yeah I forgot they actually would like change the words rather than believe it's control of the water and it would be the actor would do it forgot yeah
[381:36.39]They were... Man, how did I... I, like, missed the whole joke.
[381:39.44]That's true, though.
[381:40.08]It'd be like, you are out of your floopin' mind.
[381:42.40]It's stuff that nobody would ever say.
[381:44.17]They would really do that.
[381:47.27]It made no sense.
[381:50.48]Oh, we get like a choice.
[381:51.86]You seeing this?
[381:52.62]Yeah.
[381:53.42]There's either car traps or zip lines.
[381:56.34]I want zip lines.
[381:57.30]Like, who cares about a car trap?
[381:59.70]Yeah, zip lines for sure.
[382:01.38]I just want to go.
[382:03.38]I'm voting zip line.
[382:06.15]Yeah, I voted.
[382:16.25]We did it.
[382:19.59]Peacekeeper bow is the best weapon in the whole game.
[382:23.19]Yeah, so how did we go from needing to find our girlfriend to saving villages?
[382:29.67]How does that always happen?
[382:30.92]Maybe we should play the game and find out.
[382:33.64]You should not skip every single dialog piece.
[382:37.04]I mean, I can't skip this for some reason.
[382:39.48]I've had it with these monkey fighting snakes on this Monday to Friday plane.
[382:42.96]That's a classic.
[382:44.80]That's a classic one.
[382:45.62]Okay, city alignment.
[382:55.24]Are we playing Planetside?
[382:57.54]Yeah.
[382:58.66]Okay.
[383:03.90]City alignment tool.
[383:08.22]Yeah, my city is aligning.
[383:11.46]Okay.
[383:12.02]Oh, there's like a whole other area.
[383:13.79]There's like a whole other area in this game.
[383:15.55]Yeah, we've been on Darnassus for the last six hours.
[383:19.69]Six and a half hours, dude.
[383:22.43]There's like a whole downtown.
[383:23.67]There's the wharf.
[383:27.75]Very cool.
[383:28.01]How you doing?
[383:29.35]Me?
[383:29.47]You doing alright?
[383:29.95]Are you worried about me?
[383:32.05]You want like half an hour, 30 minutes?
[383:33.17]Yeah, now that we unlocked the new area, I think that's about it for me.
[383:57.42]I mean, we've been playing for almost six and a half hours.
[383:59.23]You know, I would be good, honestly.
[384:01.45]You good?
[384:02.03]I don't know if you want to play again or what, but... Okay.
[384:06.41]It just seems like a funny spot to end, but you're like, yeah, we've been playing like all day.
[384:09.68]I wouldn't mind.
[384:11.66]Okay.
[384:12.04]Have you gotten to a thousand points?
[384:19.10]I feel like I would have to see the new area.
[384:21.19]I'm at like 950.
[384:22.01]I feel like... Okay.
[384:24.23]I don't feel like the game has too many surprises left where you start getting grappling hooks and your wing-a-dings and maybe.
[384:30.18]Yep.
[384:31.54]I think it's like
[384:34.78]It's like most games these days.
[384:36.00]It's front loaded with so much bullshit, even if the rest of it is fun.
[384:38.91]And it's hard to recommend to anyone.
[384:40.43]You're like, oh yeah, if you watch like the first season, like season two is pretty good.
[384:44.17]Skip three.
[384:45.19]And then like four is alright.
[384:48.29]Yeah, that does tend to happen nowadays.
[384:52.23]up yeah I think it's good I felt that way about dying light one though too that if if you just had all your stuff unlocked and it really was like sandbox world the game probably would have been a lot more fun I could see that I will say I give it a I give it like a 9.8 I mean like a 9.8 and a half that's very high does your scale go up to like 20 or
[385:19.99]I was just waiting for you to be like, you're a fucking idiot, so then I could prove to you.
[385:22.59]So I could prove to you the point you made earlier.
[385:25.23]Well, no, because I know that you're joking.
[385:27.83]I was waiting for you to call me dumb, so I could call you up.
[385:30.92]Okay, like Bloodborne's a 10, this is a 9.8.
[385:34.48]No, this is a solid game.
[385:37.14]I'm doing a jump joke.
[385:38.44]Are you?
[385:38.76]Let me see.
[385:43.53]Other players are waiting for you?
[385:49.69]Where are you?
[385:51.51]I don't know.
[385:52.09]Here.
[385:52.37]Here.
[385:52.57]Alright.
[385:55.69]Yeah.
[385:55.97]Maybe.
[385:56.25]I mean.
[385:56.65]If you want to play it again.
[385:57.85]We could play it again if you wanted to.
[386:01.23]How do you feel?
[386:01.71]How are you?
[386:03.47]What's your schedule like, Ster?
[386:05.59]My schedule is panic, panic, stress, Saturday myriad.
[386:11.81]Wipe my brow.
[386:13.79]Which, by the way.
[386:14.97]Panic, panic.
[386:15.93]That's in the middle of it.
[386:16.95]Episode 4 just happened, right?
[386:19.42]yeah yeah what is the what is the myriad by the way just curious I mean the myriad is uh basically like a dnd campaign that I run every week on my channel on saturdays we've got a couple of fun uh gamer streamers and in the future Jerma is going to be a part of it because it's a whole system I programmed and you don't you you can have streamer brain rot and play it because it's all automated and I am I am the dungeon master production man of the show right
[386:46.66]And where can we find you?
[386:48.88]On twitch.tv/Ster.
[386:50.70]Is there more?
[386:52.68]That's S-T-E-R.
[386:53.88]I feel like I'm killing this.
[386:55.27]Yes, S-T-E-R.
[386:58.39]It's D&D without the D&D.
[387:00.61]It's D&D without all the stuff that makes D&D slow.
[387:04.55]Yeah.
[387:05.75]Pretty cool.
[387:07.13]I think it's a really cool thing.
[387:09.63]You can just wait until Jerma plays it because one day he's going to play it.
[387:12.91]One day, yeah.
[387:13.77]Whenever we decide to do that.
[387:17.34]But yeah.
[387:17.64]Indeed.
[387:18.78]If you actually do want to play this again at some point, like this week or whatever, let me know.
[387:22.84]We can get to the non-tutorial island in like an hour.
[387:28.21]What's your schedule like?
[387:30.09]I was going to do like some just chatting stuff, but tomorrow's Valentine's Day, and I want to spend it with my girlfriend.
[387:39.21]So I was thinking about, I don't know, maybe like, do you want to play on like Wednesday?
[387:46.40]Wednesday?
[387:49.07]Uh, I mean, I was just curious your general overall.
[387:51.35]I mean, I'd even be like, like, like if I was like, hey, like, what about this other game?
[387:54.88]We're like, oh, cool, new thing.
[387:55.92]Then we do, we do the new thing.
[387:57.88]Um, I would say, I mean, Wednesday, I was probably going to stream like IRL, just like just chatting for like an hour or two.
[388:04.26]Okay, we'll figure it out.
[388:06.31]We can play on Wednesday.
[388:08.39]Yep.
[388:09.17]Okay.
[388:10.99]Sounds good.
[388:11.39]Thanks for playing, Ster.
[388:12.11]Appreciate it, man.
[388:12.77]Okay, yeah, yeah, take care.
[388:13.63]And, uh, you know, um, yeah, bye.
[388:15.93]And we'll see, we'll see you on probably Wednesday.
[388:18.66]Alright.
[388:19.38]Alright.
[388:19.72]It's a date.
[388:20.08]It's a date.
[388:22.43]Alright.
[388:24.81]I will see you guys.
[388:25.77]We'll do it on Wednesday.
[388:27.85]Seems like a good time to do it.
[388:28.71]Let me try to gift 100 community subs again for like the 10th time.
[388:35.70]I'm going to run the credits.
[388:36.50]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[388:38.50]I don't want to go too, too late here into Eastern time.
[388:44.02]I wonder if my cards are going to get declined again.
[388:48.67]Yeah, on Wednesday, I was going to do two days in a row, but it's Valentine's Day.
[388:52.39]I want to spend it with Ollie, so I'm going to spend it with Ollie.
[388:55.39]I'm going to have a plan.
[388:59.17]It's going to be fun.
[389:06.00]Paste.
[389:11.78]Yeah.
[389:13.51]Yeah, we'll, uh, me and Ster will play probably again on Wednesday.
[389:16.41]We'll do the browser game stuff on Wednesday too.
[389:18.66]Because I, honestly, I'll be really honest.
[389:20.80]I don't think I would be playing this on stream for like another, like, eight hours.
[389:29.52]So.
[389:30.54]Oh, the Game Master!
[389:32.00]He is a Game Master!
[389:36.02]See?
[389:36.50]He proved it right there.
[389:38.84]Game Master has disconnected you and you're going to return to your game.
[389:45.50]Alright.
[389:47.44]A couple things I do want to talk about real quick.
[389:50.76]Today is the last day for you to nominate people for the Streamer Awards.
[389:57.47]It ends, I believe, tonight at midnight.
[390:00.62]So if you have, I was going to take it on stream, but I've looked at the list and I realized that I don't think I would reliably be able to answer too many of these just because I don't really watch a ton of like some of the content that's here.
[390:15.92]Yeah, I'll link it.
[390:17.57]Hold on.
[390:22.79]It is alone is the streamer awards.com.
[390:32.52]Here it is.
[390:34.22]There are a shitload of categories.
[390:35.94]You guys know Cutie, Cinderella, and Maya.
[390:40.93]They are running this.
[390:41.63]There's a ton of people involved.
[390:46.61]It seems like a pretty cool idea.
[390:48.11]It's sort of like a Twitch awards show.
[390:54.60]If I could give you the ones, if you want me to do some nominations here, I could probably give you some if I'm scrolling down the list.
[391:01.14]But stuff like League Streamer, Roleplay Streamer, Battle Royale Streamer, I don't really watch too much of that.
[391:08.76]So I don't really know.
[391:09.72]But let's see here.
[391:13.15]I'll give you some examples.
[391:17.25]The vote ended?
[391:19.11]Did it?
[391:22.41]No, it didn't.
[391:22.77]Did it?
[391:27.53]It should be until midnight, right?
[391:32.31]It's ended?
[391:32.85]It didn't?
[391:33.37]It did.
[391:33.85]It did it?
[391:34.33]Oh, shit.
[391:34.93]Did I miss it?
[391:39.07]No, it doesn't.
[391:39.43]I can see it still.
[391:44.57]You don't have to enter a name for each.
[391:47.15]Yeah, you can skip categories.
[391:52.61]It says February 13th, they end.
[391:54.01]Yeah, tonight, yeah, today.
[391:56.51]Tonight at midnight, that's what I said.
[392:01.81]But yeah, let me go through some of these real quick.
[392:04.04]I'll give you some of my opinions.
[392:05.96]I mean, I'll start with, I guess, VTuber streamer.
[392:08.08]I'm going to say Nianers.
[392:12.04]I don't really know that many other VTuber streamers.
[392:20.87]If I were to keep going... Best... Like, Smash Brothers, I don't really know.
[392:28.45]Sports Game, I don't really know.
[392:29.73]I don't really know who else.
[392:33.63]Best... Okay, best variety streamer, I would say Ludwig.
[392:38.35]Ludwig absolutely is best variety streamer of the year, without a doubt.
[392:44.73]Best streamed event?
[392:46.71]I would say... I mean, you know... You know...
[392:51.44]You know, whatever, whatever.
[392:52.26]I don't know.
[392:53.12]You know, there's things that happened this year or it's supposed to be 2021.
[392:58.25]So stream game of the year is what would be a stream game of the year?
[393:14.21]Stream game of the year.
[393:19.07]Because this is all across all of, shit, you can't, hold on.
[393:22.55]This is across all the platforms, right?
[393:25.57]Because it's not just like, oh, a game that I played on my channel.
[393:31.92]It's like just across all of Twitch, all of YouTube, everywhere.
[393:36.70]I mean, Among Us, I would probably say, I mean, that's like one of the biggest things that happened last year, right?
[393:43.46]I mean, I didn't play it.
[393:47.97]I don't know.
[393:50.35]It's my vote.
[393:51.13]Yeah, it is.
[393:51.65]It is.
[393:52.37]I don't know.
[393:53.35]I would probably say Among Us, even though I don't even, like, play it.
[393:57.98]Best content organization.
[394:00.86]Esports are a content organization that has created the best content during the past year.
[394:03.70]But I think... I would probably put the production company that I work with every time.
[394:10.76]Community Jake's company.
[394:15.57]That's what I was going to put.
[394:20.85]I don't know if that's like an e-sport, a content organization.
[394:25.28]That has created the best content.
[394:28.28]If that fits, I mean, I don't know if it does, but that's JK Productions.
[394:33.94]I don't know if that's accurate, but.
[394:38.93]Uh, if I keep going.
[394:40.07]I don't know, I can't, some of these it's hard.
[394:47.59]Like Rising Star Award, for instance.
[394:52.85]Like, who's, like, somebody that... Like, I didn't really notice before, but they're, like, really kind of blowing up.
[395:07.55]Um... I don't know.
[395:10.21]It's hard to put somebody here because... Are we talking brand up-and-coming streamer that's had tremendous growth over the past year and has the potential to be a top streamer?
[395:22.18]I mean, I would say... I mean, Connor's been pretty popular for a while, though.
[395:29.29]Maybe, like, Atriok?
[395:30.65]But he's been popular, too, for a while.
[395:33.77]How popular are they going to be?
[395:38.85]Is popular, like, 5 to 10?
[395:42.72]Like, I don't know.
[395:48.38]I'm not sure.
[395:55.84]Because all the people that I would put in this list are already pretty popular.
[396:00.12]Like they already have like a large following.
[396:02.32]I don't know.
[396:02.62]I don't know who I'd put there.
[396:10.05]Legacy Award.
[396:10.83]A legend who's contributed a great deal and has shaped the industry.
[396:15.65]Career Achievement Award.
[396:17.09]I don't know.
[396:17.49]I don't know who I would even say for that.
[396:23.42]Gamer of the Year.
[396:25.39]I gotta give that to xQc.
[396:26.39]Are you serious?
[396:29.09]Streamer that has extraordinary gaming abilities and has excelled at games over the past year.
[396:36.63]And then Streamer of the Year.
[396:42.37]Streamer of the Year.
[396:45.89]I mean, I think I have to nominate Ludwig for this.
[396:50.87]I think Ludwig did a ton of shit.
[396:53.11]He did so many things.
[396:55.63]I think he's probably one of the few people that is doing interesting content on every platform.
[397:05.23]Yeah, but I'm not going to vote for myself.
[397:07.29]I'm not going to go into the presidential booth and be like, that's right, that's me.
[397:12.76]No, I'm giving you my opinions, right?
[397:16.14]This is not just for Twitch, this is for everywhere.
[397:17.76]This is YouTube, this is Twitch, this is... Facebook?
[397:22.20]I don't know.
[397:25.84]Presidents do do that, though.
[397:28.99]Yeah, but if I'm not talking about, like, being an ego Andy... I would say probably Ludwig.
[397:40.87]That's what I would say.
[397:48.54]He's done a lot of stuff.
[397:51.07]Yeah.
[397:53.77]He's also done a lot of stuff for this channel.
[397:56.61]I mean, a lot of things.
[398:00.83]I got a lot of help from him over the last year or two.
[398:04.45]For tons of different things.
[398:06.33]So he's a really, really great dude.
[398:15.65]And I really do genuinely think that he does interesting stuff.
[398:21.17]Either that or I'm gonna put xQc.
[398:22.63]Like, I'm just gonna put xQc here if it's not Ludwig.
[398:26.95]That's what I'm gonna do.
[398:31.28]Also, like, League of Their Own, the streamer is a pioneer that creates one-of-a-kind content with their creativity out of the box, thinking they're a trailblazer in the streaming industry, someone who relies on themselves for their content and genuinely is in a League of Their Own.
[398:44.30]I mean, I would probably put xQc here, too.
[398:48.15]Like, xQc just does his own shit.
[398:50.19]He doesn't, like, rely on anything or anybody else.
[398:52.89]He kind of just does his thing.
[398:53.77]He's in his own lane.
[398:57.91]Yeah, but we're not talking about me right now.
[398:59.89]We're not talking about me.
[399:05.00]You can vote for whoever you want, and that's cool.
[399:07.36]Alright.
[399:08.18]Okay.
[399:08.52]You can vote for whoever you want.
[399:11.76]But I'm just, okay, I'm taking myself out of the equation.
[399:14.98]I can't, what am I going to be here and be like, oh, let me tell you how I think about me.
[399:19.62]I belong here.
[399:20.38]I belong here.
[399:21.10]I belong here.
[399:21.84]I belong here.
[399:23.11]Yeah, best Valorant streamer.
[399:24.69]That's me, baby.
[399:26.07]Yep.
[399:35.69]Yeah, I think that's accurate.
[399:36.73]I'm going to say Ludwig.
[399:39.32]I think that's accurate.
[399:44.44]All the others, it's hard for me to do because I don't watch too many streamers.
[399:51.07]We're the oldest juicer couple.
[399:55.25]Oh, God.
[399:55.91]Oh, no.
[400:07.82]Oh, no.
[400:18.09]Alright, I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[400:20.33]Take care of yourselves.
[400:22.04]Let me try to give a hundred community subs.
[400:35.66]I hope it works.
[400:36.43]Okay, here we go.
[400:42.49]Are you ready?
[400:48.65]Does it go through?
[400:50.59]Uh-huh.
[400:55.39]Come on.
[400:59.94]Oh, wait.
[401:01.50]I have to actually get my credit card again.
[401:05.76]It's not saved.
[401:06.58]Why is it not saved?
[401:07.52]100 subs.
[401:12.27]Let's go.
[401:17.85]Oh, I got it.
[401:18.93]I got it.
[401:19.27]It's in there.
[401:19.79]Here we go.
[401:21.25]Please work, please work, please work, please work.
[401:26.54]Payment processing.
[401:30.90]What the fuck?
[401:32.98]Purchase could not be completed.
[401:34.14]There was an error during the order.
[401:35.50]Why can I not buy community subs?
[401:40.06]I literally used this credit card like 12 hours ago.
[401:45.09]Why does this keep happening?
[401:45.87]I'm going to have to talk to Twitch.
[401:49.08]Why is this happening?
[401:50.41]Every option doesn't work.
[401:59.05]I used this card, I'm not kidding, like less than 12 hours ago.
[402:04.52]Okay.
[402:05.66]I gotta... I gotta talk to Twitch and be like, why can I not gift subs?
[402:10.44]Am I buying one?
[402:14.20]Okay, I'm gonna buy... Let's see if I can do like 10.
[402:21.68]Let's do 10 subs.
[402:23.97]Complete purchase.
[402:24.93]Okay.
[402:25.21]Payment processing.
[402:27.35]Your gift order will be completed soon.
[402:31.73]Purchase could not be completed.
[402:33.11]There was an error during the order.
[402:34.37]I don't get it.
[402:39.64]I'm going to try to get to the bottom of this and I'm going to try again.
[402:42.00]Because I've tried three different payment methods.
[402:56.27]Can we try?
[402:57.69]Holly, can you gift 100 subs?
[402:58.55]And then I'll just send transfer the money to you.
[403:09.60]Okay.
[403:12.62]Can you try?
[403:18.67]Hold on, hold on, let me, let me, let me see if I can get this to work.
[403:21.29]Alright, hold on, wait a minute.
[403:27.01]Wait, hold on, let me try using my card.
[403:29.37]Yeah, wait, wait, wait, come here, come here, come here.
[403:30.75]Here, use my card.
[403:38.15]Okay, she's gonna try to use my card.
[403:41.93]But if that goes through, that's fucking weird, why is it happening?
[403:56.89]You have to put the numbers on the back.
[403:59.75]I did.
[404:00.21]Honestly, if this works, I'm going to have to actually talk to Twitch and be like, why am I banned from community subs?
[404:12.20]I thought that was just her.
[404:13.46]Only do 500.
[404:17.13]No, only do 100.
[404:17.77]Did it work?
[404:31.24]Oh, she needs, like, bank info.
[404:34.28]Hold on.
[404:39.88]Sending bank info.
[404:50.22]No, don't do a thousand.
[404:51.30]Okay.
[404:59.63]Here we go.
[405:02.86]Did it work?
[405:03.30]I don't think it worked.
[405:18.27]No, nothing?
[405:24.23]No, I didn't accidentally use a Dave and Buster's gift card.
[405:29.12]You got an error?
[405:30.54]Yeah, what's going on here?
[405:31.46]Alright.
[405:31.76]I don't know what's going on.
[405:32.80]I gotta call my bank.
[405:34.90]Alright.
[405:35.16]Well, I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[405:36.18]Hopefully I got this figured out.
[405:37.94]It didn't work.
[405:40.92]I'll see you guys later.
[405:41.90]Have a wonderful rest of your day.
[405:43.42]Thank you.
[405:47.22]I'm not broke.
[405:48.48]I just... My car doesn't work in Twitch.
[405:50.00]But it works everywhere else.
[405:51.18]That's so weird.
[405:55.56]Happy Valentine's Day, all of you.
[405:59.92]You know, just have a good day, you know?
[406:05.86]You want to raid some?
[406:08.64]Alright, let's raid somebody.
[406:09.74]I mean, this raid is going to be like 100 people.
[406:13.49]I've been sitting here dilly-dallying.
[406:16.61]Who's live?
[406:16.97]Let me take a look.
[406:21.38]Okay, what do we got?
[406:22.18]What do we got?
[406:22.54]What do we got?
[406:22.90]What do we got?
[406:23.26]What do we got?
[406:23.60]What do we got?
[406:31.94]Vinny's doing weird AI shit.
[406:38.09]Alright, let's go.
[406:46.34]I will see you guys on Wednesday.
[406:47.80]Have a great night.
[406:48.88]Go say hello to Vinny.
[406:53.16]Take care of yourself.
[406:55.33]Goodbye.
[406:56.11]Good night.
[407:02.54]I'll see you soon.
[407:14.08]Why?
[407:14.30]Why did I wait so long to say that last part?
[407:16.00]I waited way too long.
[407:29.00]Yeah, and no, alright, I'm being serious.
[407:31.08]Dead serious Andy right now.
[407:33.30]No more of the raid song shit.
[407:35.26]Don't, no more of that.
[407:36.34]Like, raiding people when they get raided and they just have to look over and they get being forced to have to do something.
[407:43.37]Don't, no more of that shit.
[407:45.07]No more.
[407:45.79]No more raid songs.
[407:46.85]No more raid songs.
[407:48.07]No more raid songs.
[407:49.09]Stop it.
[407:49.67]Stop it.
[407:50.18]Stop it.
[407:50.68]Stop it.
[407:51.16]I demand it.
[407:51.84]I command it.
[407:52.52]I'm telling you, I demand you don't do this.
[408:00.66]I command it.
[408:02.90]I'll see you tomorrow.
[408:09.79]No, Wednesday.
[408:10.65]No, Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday.
[408:12.97]Are we grounded again?
[408:14.29]We'll find out.
[408:14.95]Have a great night, guys.
[408:15.61]See you later.
[408:15.95]Goodbye.
