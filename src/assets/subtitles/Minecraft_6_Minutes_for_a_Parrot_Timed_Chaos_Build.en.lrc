[00:08.50]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.28]Jerma here, and MLC_St3alth.
[00:13.80]Hello!
[00:14.74]Hello!
[00:15.98]We are going to be reviving an old series we used to do called Timed Chaos Build.
[00:22.22]If you don't know what this is, it's where we give ourselves a certain amount of time to build an object or animal, and we have to stop when we get to the end of that time.
[00:31.62]So, what are we building today, MLC_St3alth?
[00:33.70]Jerma, today we are going to be building a parrot.
[00:36.41]A parrot?! !
[00:38.00]One of those old pirate-style parrots.
[00:41.23]So, if you are ready... Oh, dude!
[00:44.91]I forgot about that.
[00:45.61]It doesn't even match.
[00:47.13]Well, match it.
[00:48.47]I did.
[00:49.53]Alright, well, we're gonna try and build a parrot in six minutes.
[00:53.07]And whatever we end up with, with is what we end up with.
[00:55.57]So, are you ready?
[00:57.41]I think so.
[00:58.71]In three, two, one.
[01:02.50]Wait, hold on.
[01:03.58]My timer messed up.
[01:04.78]Three, two, one.
[01:05.30]Go!
[01:08.90]Okay, parakeet.
[01:09.48]How does it start?
[01:10.48]It needs feet, right?
[01:12.76]Why does he have, like, coal for feet?
[01:15.92]Why do you have that color?
[01:17.42]Because that's the, like, it's toes.
[01:19.80]Oh, I don't have that color.
[01:21.94]Oh.
[01:23.30]Why?
[01:23.40]I got it.
[01:23.76]Uh, let's see, like, toes.
[01:27.46]He's gonna be huge!
[01:29.72]Alright, fine, alright.
[01:30.56]It has to be, and then we have to do it to the side, too.
[01:35.46]Um... Whoops.
[01:38.52]Wait, what are you doing?
[01:39.34]I'm trying to, like, continue it.
[01:40.88]Let me undo everything you do.
[01:42.38]Alright, you do the feet.
[01:43.38]I'll do the, uh... And then it goes up.
[01:45.82]Alright, so let's do this here.
[01:47.06]So now... Oh, crap, I didn't do that right.
[01:49.21]That's his leg.
[01:49.85]Alright, almost a minute has gone by.
[01:53.03]We need to hurry this up.
[01:54.27]Oh, yeah, we haven't, like, even started yet, huh?
[01:58.67]There we go.
[01:59.29]Hey, his butt's gotta come out kind of far.
[02:02.07]Because don't parrots have big butts with tails?
[02:05.09]I don't know.
[02:06.11]Yeah, they do.
[02:06.57]I haven't seen... So this is going to be a green... I thought we were doing a yellow parrot.
[02:13.50]Uh, we are.
[02:14.58]Now, change this to red.
[02:16.70]Wait, he's green, though.
[02:18.16]Yeah, but he's green just until this part.
[02:20.36]Wait, he's different colored?
[02:22.24]Yeah, parrots are a ton of different colors.
[02:24.20]Aren't they tropical colored, kind of?
[02:26.38]I don't know.
[02:26.74]Yeah, they are.
[02:28.36]I probably should have Googled parrot before this was...
[02:31.44]Alright, no, no, no.
[02:32.30]Now we have to go, um, to red.
[02:35.32]This is already looking like our horse that we did first.
[02:37.92]No, it's not going to be.
[02:38.66]It'll be better.
[02:40.30]Oh, no, get it.
[02:41.02]How many?
[02:41.46]No, no, get it.
[02:42.64]They only have two legs.
[02:44.24]Like, you need to make this even.
[02:46.30]Like, you need to go this way too.
[02:48.10]It's alright.
[02:49.16]Because here's his tail.
[02:52.20]Tail?
[02:54.02]Yeah.
[02:56.46]Alright, we're making Qbert right now.
[02:58.38]So, let's... Alright, yellow.
[03:02.09]He's gotta have a yellow-like belly.
[03:03.89]Oh, it's getting, like, dark in this area.
[03:06.81]Don't worry, I can change the time if we need it.
[03:13.37]Two minutes have gone by.
[03:15.09]Oh, good.
[03:15.39]Alright, already, he's looking like a... pancake.
[03:21.13]Why do we... gold-plated, he's like...
[03:24.50]This parrot's, like, doing very well, apparently.
[03:29.37]These gold plates don't mesh together very well.
[03:31.63]It doesn't make one, like, solid chunk, does it?
[03:34.39]No, it doesn't.
[03:35.55]But you know what?
[03:36.04]It's too late.
[03:36.56]I think it's coming along okay.
[03:40.66]This just looks like corn.
[03:42.48]Like corn on the cob.
[03:52.85]No, this is gonna look like an owl.
[03:55.01]Just keep building.
[03:55.89]We'll deal with it.
[03:57.43]Alright, we've... I'll come up this way.
[04:05.69]Three minutes have almost gone by.
[04:07.51]We're halfway there.
[04:09.85]We need to make his body a little bit more fat.
[04:12.19]Alright, I'll deal with that.
[04:12.91]You deal with the body.
[04:16.39]He's way too big.
[04:17.39]He's... What is he?
[04:20.57]He's not even anything.
[04:21.55]He's a block on top of a block.
[04:26.01]We're just putting shapes together and calling it a parrot.
[04:31.15]He looks... He looks like the Roadrunner if the Roadrunner had, like, ran... It looks like the Roadrunner ran into a wall and, like, squished his face.
[04:42.04]Alright, now that's enough of that.
[04:43.36]Now we need to stop making the head.
[04:45.71]Oh yeah, these things have heads, don't they?
[04:48.07]Yeah, they have heads.
[04:48.83]What is that, like, corn on the cob body?
[04:52.75]We need a beak!
[04:57.29]We need his head first!
[05:00.85]Looks like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle.
[05:04.79]Looks like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle coming out of a cone on the cob, sitting on top of a table.
[05:11.58]This is the worst thing ever.
[05:13.80]Oh, whoa, save.
[05:14.44]What's going on?
[05:15.02]Saving?
[05:15.40]Looks like lag.
[05:16.80]No, we need a beak.
[05:17.68]We need a beak first.
[05:18.50]The beak has to be red.
[05:20.40]Beak comes out like this.
[05:22.62]And this comes out too.
[05:24.32]It's like platypus.
[05:25.62]This looks like a duck.
[05:27.32]No, because we're going to give him like a big feathered head back here.
[05:31.94]Oh, good.
[05:33.54]Glad we're doing that.
[05:34.48]Four minutes and 28 seconds.
[05:36.10]Look, this is looking good.
[05:39.80]Look at that.
[05:41.22]He only looks like somebody... Like, threw up on their screen.
[05:48.40]This is not a parrot.
[05:49.36]This is some, like, cartoon network.
[05:52.62]This is a character from, like, Foster's Home for Imaginary Kids.
[05:58.36]He really is a character from, like, Cartoon Network.
[06:02.51]And apparently he's super saiyan right now.
[06:04.23]Alright, one minute left.
[06:08.13]Oh, gotta finish the body.
[06:14.72]Alright, what happened on this side of his head?
[06:17.68]I gotta fix up his mouth.
[06:18.92]His mouth is awful.
[06:21.63]Everything about this is awful.
[06:23.19]He's not a parrot.
[06:24.83]No, yes he is.
[06:25.59]Yes he is.
[06:29.41]He doesn't have wings!
[06:30.70]He doesn't have wings!
[06:31.56]He doesn't have wings!
[06:32.26]We gotta give him like wings, oh god!
[06:35.48]I thought his wings are like a part of his body, like they combine.
[06:40.62]He like retracts them, so they're invisible.
[06:43.80]No, not anymore, he has wings now.
[06:45.73]30 seconds!
[06:48.43]Oh Leia, look at that like beautiful parakeet.
[06:53.69]15 seconds!
[06:55.03]Clean it up!
[06:58.21]This guy looks like he's in pain.
[06:59.83]This guy is in severe physical pain.
[07:03.21]Five, four, three, two, one, and there it is.
[07:08.66]You attached his wings to his leg.
[07:14.40]Doesn't he look like he's screaming?
[07:18.73]He just got, like, run over by a bus and he's waiting to die.
[07:21.49]He seriously looks like he is screaming, like, like, this hurts.
[07:27.23]Look at his staircase for a back.
[07:32.40]Oh, yeah, good.
[07:33.08]Awesome.
[07:33.38]Let's, like, walk up the staircase that's supposed to be the parrot's back.
[07:37.71]Onto the creamed corn body.
[07:41.15]Oh, that's so funny.
[07:43.18]Look at these eyes.
[07:44.98]Okay, he's just like a normal green parrot, but he's wearing like a yellow towel and the like yellow woman shower gown that they wrap around their hair.
[07:53.32]Like he just got out of the shower and he wrapped two towels, one around his body, one around his hair.
[07:57.73]Yeah, he just got out of the shower.
[08:01.76]Oh, that's so funny.
[08:02.46]Alright, so you guys are gonna give this guy a name.
[08:05.04]And a rating.
[08:06.50]One to ten.
[08:07.08]I think the rating's gonna be pretty low for this one.
[08:12.40]Foster's home for imaginary friends.
[08:14.51]Oh, that's so funny.
[08:17.99]Alright, guys.
[08:18.49]Well, thanks so much for watching.
[08:20.13]And we'll see you all next time.
[08:21.23]And of course, take care, everybody.
