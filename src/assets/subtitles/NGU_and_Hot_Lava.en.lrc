[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.91]Hello, how are you?
[00:06.60]Good afternoon Stream will be idling soon Maybe possibly we do have a few options.
[00:20.23]Oh
[00:23.76]I just saw this come out on Steam.
[00:26.56]And... Needed to play it.
[00:29.26]I just want to see what's in it.
[00:33.26]I have a pretty addictive personality.
[00:35.76]And... If something's fun, sometimes I want to do it more than once.
[00:41.23]More than twice.
[00:43.69]The game we're going to play today... Is called... NGU.
[00:50.21]Idle.
[00:50.87]It's called Numbers Go Up.
[00:53.58]And the whole point of the game is for numbers to increase in value.
[00:58.08]That's it.
[00:58.68]There's nothing else in this game.
[01:01.77]So I have a backup in case this is not fun for... Alright, there's two things that'll happen.
[01:08.01]I'm gonna... The stream's been live for a minute and a half.
[01:11.77]Here we go.
[01:13.81]We will either play this for 30 minutes or 16 straight hours.
[01:25.07]We may also play this for 30 minutes, and then move on to the Floor is Lava game.
[01:32.82]I don't know.
[01:33.72]I have no plan today.
[01:38.46]Don't do it.
[01:39.64]I just made that up.
[01:40.42]I pretended like somebody said don't do it.
[01:44.99]What's the... No, no, it's actually the Floor is Lava.
[01:47.11]The name of the game is called, like, Lava Floor.
[01:52.17]Right?
[01:52.43]What's it called?
[01:53.01]What's the name of the game?
[01:54.53]What is the name of that game?
[01:58.10]A Hot Lava is the name of the game, actually.
[02:02.30]It's a parkour game where you can't touch the floor.
[02:06.80]Because, of course, the floor is made out of lava.
[02:11.33]But we ain't gonna do that yet.
[02:17.11]I've got a number of games to get addicted to first.
[02:23.98]Is this pre-recorded?
[02:24.82]Why would this be a pre-recorded stream?
[02:28.38]I would pick the numbers go upstream to be pre-recorded.
[02:33.27]I mean, I guess that would make some sense now that I think about it.
[02:36.79]It is just gonna be us watching a screen with numbers going up in succession.
[02:41.78]But there's RPG elements in this game.
[02:45.78]I guess.
[02:46.92]I've tried it.
[02:48.34]I opened it to just so I... I didn't want to be the idiot that has no idea what he's doing.
[02:53.94]And yes, whoa, it's easy.
[02:55.38]You just watch numbers go up.
[02:56.58]This is way more involved, I believe.
[03:00.72]I'll show it to you right now, just so you can see.
[03:03.72]Just so you completely understand.
[03:04.92]Take a look.
[03:12.24]But apparently there's like a jackass disclaimer.
[03:17.40]I'm gonna assume this says, like, take a break every seven hours or something, right?
[03:25.22]It has to be.
[03:25.66]It's gonna be like a Wiimote take a break thing.
[03:30.43]Somebody just gave $50.
[03:32.07]That was 5,000 bits from Phylactery Lich.
[03:38.55]Phylactery's back.
[03:41.08]With another 5,000 bits.
[03:42.64]Can't wait to watch my favorite streamers numbers go up.
[03:45.02]Now give me some box steps.
[03:48.44]Two completely different streams, the last two.
[03:50.40]Yesterday we did a bunch of crazy shit in Hitman.
[03:52.52]Today, if you got a book report to do, you know, just have it in the background.
[03:58.94]If you've got some work to do, we can all just pretend we're playing this together.
[04:03.96]Because you can, like, go to sleep if you want to.
[04:08.31]I know that, like, Business Management 101, uh, I would get grabbed and, like, an earpiece would be in my ear or something that says, don't fucking tell your audience to, like, leave or sleep on stream.
[04:21.20]Well, I didn't tell you to leave.
[04:22.74]I told you to stay and study.
[04:25.38]Because you have a book report due tomorrow.
[04:27.18]I saw somebody in the pre-stream chat.
[04:29.54]They needed, they were like, I got this paper that's almost done.
[04:32.05]Do it now.
[04:32.77]Look, right now, with us.
[04:34.77]Well, I'm not gonna do your paper for you, but do it now.
[04:40.04]This is a babysitting stream.
[04:42.29]Alright, if you've got... No, that's not right.
[04:44.85]Never mind.
[04:48.05]Stop reminding me.
[04:49.81]Alright, let's read this.
[04:50.49]It says, Wumpf.
[04:53.58]As you come to, the first thing you notice is the taste of copper in your mouth.
[04:56.78]Why is it always that?
[04:59.02]Even a game like Portal had that.
[05:03.31]Remember, when you walk through the first thing, it's like, oh, the taste of iron and copper in your mouth is normal.
[05:08.51]It's always like some metal that's in your mouth.
[05:12.15]The second being the stench of raw sewage all around you.
[05:17.96]You get up, nursing your busted lip and rubbing your head.
[05:24.11]which feels like it was lovingly caressed by a concrete block.
[05:28.14]You try to remember how you got to, well, whatever this place is.
[05:32.56]You realize, with a surprising lack of panic, that you've forgotten who you are.
[05:37.14]Based on the state you're in right now, you're thinking they must have been an asshole.
[05:44.31]I love the writing in this.
[05:48.93]That's such a great sentence.
[05:51.17]Tossed in a gross pit of sewage.
[05:54.47]At least for the short term, you have an objective, finding a way out of here.
[05:58.25]It kind of feels like the right thing to do.
[06:00.24]You try to stand up, but your knees are weak.
[06:02.46]They shake, they buckle, and you fall back down.
[06:05.00]It's only now that you feel the weakness in your body.
[06:08.42]Not any normal sort of weakness, like when you stand up too quickly and get lightheaded, or have your arm ripped off in an industrial accident.
[06:16.02]No, you feel like something has sapped away the majority of your strength.
[06:20.49]Well, there's nothing to do but to try to regain some of that strength and to get out of here.
[06:23.41]Maybe hitting a big white button named play will let you do something fun.
[06:35.04]Alright.
[06:36.02]Here we go.
[06:38.60]Fun is relative, I believe.
[06:42.68]But this is... Wait, has this been...
[06:50.60]Now, this has just been on for an hour and 23 minutes.
[06:54.64]Because I was sitting at that screen.
[06:58.68]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[06:59.47]This is not right.
[07:00.43]This is incorrect.
[07:02.47]This is incorrect.
[07:03.01]I have to restart it.
[07:04.13]We should do a new game.
[07:07.33]Yeah, new game.
[07:08.57]It was sitting at that press play screen for an hour and 23 minutes, apparently.
[07:18.03]Alright, whatever.
[07:18.73]We're good.
[07:19.03]Let's start a new game.
[07:22.51]So I was ready for a total time played.
[07:25.38]1 hour and 23 minutes.
[07:28.92]No, this is... I was like eating food and like getting the stream ready and like taking a shit.
[07:34.97]This is how long it takes for me to start a stream, guys.
[07:37.96]That's an hour and 23 minutes.
[07:39.59]So I got everything ready, and I was like, alright, I've gotta take shit.
[07:42.19]Alright, that's 25 minutes.
[07:43.53]I gotta take a shower.
[07:44.35]That's like 15-20 minutes.
[07:45.89]I gotta eat food.
[07:46.57]That's like 30- Yeah, that's how long- This is exactly how long it takes for me to start a livestream.
[07:52.43]After, like, getting up in the morning.
[07:53.87]25 minutes shit.
[07:56.79]Yeah.
[07:57.05]What are you talking about?
[08:02.89]I don't buy this for a second that some of you guys take- I'm not-
[08:08.95]20 minutes?
[08:09.21]15 minutes?
[08:09.81]I don't know, 10 minutes?
[08:10.67]15 minutes?
[08:11.39]It depends on what I'm reading on my iPhone.
[08:14.15]Look, if there's like a big thing on Twitter that I'm looking at, I'm gonna be there.
[08:19.31]It takes two minutes to take a shit.
[08:21.06]Holy fuck, what are you talking about?
[08:23.38]How long does it take you to wipe your ass?
[08:25.48]It takes five minutes to wipe your ass.
[08:28.06]Two minutes?
[08:32.79]You are a liar if you think that you can tell me right now that you wipe your ass in less than five minutes.
[08:37.68]Nope, I don't believe you.
[08:38.78]And if you do that, and that's actually true, I don't know if that's totally, I don't know if it's totally clean or not.
[08:49.52]Like a three minute ass wiping.
[08:50.87]Alright, so first of all, that's all I need to say.
[09:00.51]That's funny, though.
[09:01.23]That actually is funny.
[09:02.01]That's how long it takes.
[09:02.81]Okay, start a new game.
[09:05.13]Oh, woomph.
[09:06.21]You come, too.
[09:10.71]This guy has swamp ass.
[09:12.29]No, I want a clean body.
[09:16.53]Completely.
[09:18.03]Void of all filth.
[09:20.35]Alright, we're done.
[09:23.11]It took me two minutes to say that.
[09:25.53]Did it take me two minutes to do that?
[09:27.09]No, it didn't.
[09:28.13]How long has the stream been live for?
[09:31.89]Ten minutes.
[09:32.59]What?!
[09:33.41]We've been live for like three!
[09:34.99]Oh god, alright.
[09:38.58]Hey there, whoever you are.
[09:39.60]Glad you decided to check out NGU.
[09:42.20]I'm something of a game developer myself.
[09:44.62]The guy who made this game.
[09:45.40]People call me 4G for short.
[09:47.26]That's, alright, that's cool.
[09:48.78]I see the sun.
[09:49.30]And then we had a ton more money just came in.
[09:51.54]What's going on?
[09:52.10]Why are you guys giving so much money right now?
[10:00.01]Lecronda gave 5,000 bits twice.
[10:02.55]They gave 10,000 bits.
[10:07.04]Jerma, step up your shitting game.
[10:08.54]Spread your ass cheeks.
[10:09.92]I don't think I can read this.
[10:12.36]Your asshole... No.
[10:17.88]Everybody has their own way to do that.
[10:23.53]If you talk to anybody, and I am going to get a little gross, okay?
[10:26.73]Okay?
[10:29.47]No, I'm not.
[10:30.09]We're going to be PG for this one.
[10:32.37]They write books for kids on this shit, guys.
[10:34.11]Don't worry.
[10:36.40]When you... Two different people don't go to the bathroom the same way.
[10:44.16]Everybody has their own bathroom ritual.
[10:48.21]All of us.
[10:50.71]It's like built into the DNA of humans.
[10:55.44]Some people, you know, they prep.
[10:59.14]They prep for like five minutes.
[11:00.78]They just sit there, they prep.
[11:02.45]They do the prep work.
[11:04.39]Some people need to drink a coffee in the morning to get themselves, or water to get themselves going.
[11:09.43]That's prep work.
[11:10.33]That's included in the shift time.
[11:16.06]There's also post work, too.
[11:19.78]I stretch after I go to the second one.
[11:24.35]Because I want to make sure everything's all, you know, your intestines need to be kind of nice and moved around.
[11:29.46]Jog in place for a minute.
[11:30.50]Shake around.
[11:35.28]I stretch after I... What are you talking about?
[11:36.85]What do you mean stop?
[11:45.55]Stop.
[11:52.46]What are you talking about?
[11:53.52]I'm talking about af- like I- I get up and like do- like touch my toes.
[12:02.38]I'm not doing these exercises in the bathroom.
[12:09.98]What are you- what are you just talking about?
[12:15.13]Somebody's given another $5,000.
[12:17.85]They say pee-pee poo-poo.
[12:19.11]That was a ball of koala for 5,000 bits.
[12:25.90]Wait, hold on.
[12:26.98]I want to make this really, really, really, completely, totally clear.
[12:31.37]I can't talk about my post-shit activity.
[12:34.89]But I can get messages spammed here in this chatroom that says, pee-pee-poo-poo like he pooped his pants.
[12:41.87]I think that's an issue.
[12:43.27]I think.
[12:48.20]We put an image on screen yesterday of everybody laughing their asses off at a fake of me pissing my pants.
[12:54.49]But this is weird for me to talk about how I stretch after I go to the bathroom.
[13:01.19]Okay.
[13:03.23]I gotta restart.
[13:04.09]Do I have to restart?
[13:10.88]Debunk.
[13:11.84]No, alright, wait, wait, wait.
[13:13.60]I have like a... I'm flying like an airplane right now.
[13:16.27]Like, hold on.
[13:18.96]What the fuck do I do?
[13:20.18]I love how that's like a message.
[13:21.42]Alright.
[13:21.98]Well, I'm just gonna go.
[13:23.52]I got fi- This is energy.
[13:25.21]Okay, you need energy.
[13:27.41]Fuck the tutorial.
[13:28.35]Who gives a shit?
[13:31.19]I know what to do.
[13:33.63]So.
[13:35.55]We've got 500 energy.
[13:37.03]This increases each moment.
[13:40.43]You can fight people.
[13:42.51]We have 1,000 HP, 100 attack, 100 defense, and current rebirth time is 6 minutes and 26 seconds.
[13:50.58]Auto-save in 7 seconds to make sure just in case something happens, you know, in case you're sitting there for too long and you've got to get up and do some prep work before you use the bathroom, and then obviously do some stretching afterwards.
[14:02.11]Get out of here.
[14:03.15]So, basic training, we have idle attack and idle block.
[14:06.07]We can't do these ones yet.
[14:08.45]And, I mean, what do you say we turn on a little bit of an OST here?
[14:10.98]My favorite OST in the world.
[14:12.18]We're talking about the Turtles in Time soundtrack.
[14:20.34]Let's get it going.
[14:21.98]I have 250 energy.
[14:24.49]Let's just spam attack.
[14:26.59]Look at my attack going up.
[14:27.39]That's a number rising increasingly.
[14:35.53]That's the whole thing.
[14:36.09]There's no other songs.
[14:40.75]Numbers go up.
[14:41.67]This is going to get much more interesting.
[14:43.76]Maybe.
[14:46.32]Maybe.
[14:47.18]I have not figured that out yet.
[14:48.98]I'm just going to play it.
[14:50.72]I can't just go all attack.
[14:52.98]I got to go defense too.
[14:53.88]This is HP.
[14:54.78]There we go.
[14:55.10]Look at that.
[14:55.40]1,200, 1,300, 1,400, 1,500.
[14:55.48]Let's just put all 500 in here.
[14:56.36]So I have a 500 cap of energy.
[15:05.14]By the way, for every ResidentSleeper that I see in the chat, it adds one minute to how long we're gonna play this.
[15:20.85]I'm tracking him, too.
[15:22.27]That's at least 280 minutes.
[15:23.45]The shit!
[15:25.03]This is the best song!
[15:25.99]This is the best song in the whole soundtrack!
[15:40.48]Levels gained to this defense skill will decrease the amount of energy needed to cap leveling speed upon rebirth.
[15:45.16]So rebirth is you prestige like Call of Duty.
[15:47.38]Call of Duty stole everything they know from NGU.
[15:54.42]Alright, I almost have a million HP.
[15:59.83]Alright, I have 626 block points.
[16:03.45]Look at the millions of HP.
[16:05.21]Alright, we're gonna do 250-250.
[16:07.77]Fight the boss.
[16:08.25]Here we go.
[16:11.29]Why am I getting hurt?
[16:14.17]Why am I already injured?
[16:16.71]How much HP do I have?
[16:18.21]How did I get hurt?
[16:19.09]Why am I getting hurt?
[16:20.57]What's hurting me?
[16:28.18]Wait!
[16:28.54]I need to read this.
[16:30.68]You shakily get to your feet.
[16:32.80]Leaning against the wall for support, you have to build up your strength somehow.
[16:36.39]From the corner of your eye, you spot a small piece of fluff.
[16:38.79]This will be your first and most intense battle of your life.
[16:42.73]50,000 attack.
[16:43.87]I got a million.
[16:44.77]I got a million.
[16:45.50]Get out of here.
[16:47.60]Oh, you squish the fluff.
[16:49.00]In more important news, that's a fantastic sandwich.
[16:51.36]Smoked ham and turkey with Swiss cheese and honeydew hoedemann.
[16:53.66]That's a pretty good sandwich.
[16:56.18]Oh hey cool, you squished the fluff.
[16:57.80]In more important news, this is a fantastic sandwich.
[17:01.20]Smoked ham and turkey with Swiss cheese and honey Dijon sauce on a ciabatta bun.
[17:06.71]That's really fucking good.
[17:11.11]I'm actually kind of jealous about that.
[17:12.19]Alright.
[17:13.43]Uh, cool.
[17:14.67]Killing bosses brings a few important rewards.
[17:16.26]First off, you gain...
[17:19.42]I'm getting vroomed by the LST.
[17:21.10]First of all, you gain experience.
[17:23.68]Experience points.
[17:24.98]Let's turn that down for just a second.
[17:29.12]Let's turn it down a little.
[17:31.46]Okay, you gain experience points for downing bosses.
[17:34.56]EXP is used to buy permanent powers in the spend EXP menu, which also you just unlocked.
[17:39.49]You should see a fancy yellow button in the bottom left.
[17:42.71]Right there.
[17:43.23]Okay.
[17:44.85]Alright.
[17:47.15]There's a lot of stuff you can buy with the XP, but don't get overwhelmed.
[17:49.91]My pro tip to you would be to buy the special offers to increase the energy.
[17:53.27]I'm gonna burp.
[17:58.26]My pro tip to you would be to buy the special offers to increase the speed the energy bar fills.
[18:03.16]I did specifically code them for newbies like you to buy, but no pressure.
[18:06.98]Defeat the next couple bosses and I'll bug you again.
[18:09.62]4G over and over.
[18:10.32]You got it.
[18:12.10]Oh lord.
[18:16.59]Alright.
[18:18.38]Total energy speed.
[18:19.94]Buying this will make the energy bar fill up faster, which is this.
[18:24.48]Max speed is one bar fill per tick, or 50 fills a second.
[18:30.47]Note, the bar fills at a rate of 50 divided by energy speed.
[18:36.63]Ticks per fill rounded up.
[18:40.36]Later on, you'll want to buy this upgrade in chunks such as 25 equals is greater than 50 speed in order to gain any effect.
[18:49.89]Alright.
[18:50.49]Newbie offers.
[18:51.07]That's what I'm looking for.
[18:51.71]What do I got?
[18:52.15]2 experience?
[18:55.91]Plus 0.3 for 2 experience points.
[18:58.89]Let's do it.
[19:00.15]Look at that!
[19:04.40]Max energy on... Max energy on this rebirth is capped at 500.
[19:07.52]On rebirth, you will have 529 energy.
[19:13.96]Alrighty.
[19:14.36]Look at how much fucking HP I have.
[19:18.30]Okay, I'm gonna freeze through the newbie zones.
[19:22.24]Alright, your current energy speed is 1.3, meaning the bar fills every 39 ticks.
[19:25.74]Next speed increases at 1.3 energy speed.
[19:27.90]Tap R to reclaim energy for a moment.
[19:29.50]Okay.
[19:30.54]Let's go.
[19:31.62]Oh yeah, look at this.
[19:32.26]I'm just completely allocating.
[19:33.38]Let's go kick some ass.
[19:35.78]Boss fight.
[19:36.38]Floating piece of shit.
[19:38.10]You're sure that it's a fluff could... If the fluff could it... If the fluff could... Comma.
[19:44.20]It would give a dramatic death speech, but alas, you kick it off to the side.
[19:48.43]More confident in your strength.
[19:50.19]What other inanimate objects are there to murder?
[19:52.91]A piece of sewage, as if by cue begins floating down the water right in front of you.
[19:59.56]Get fucking insta-killed.
[20:07.24]Boss fight, a stick.
[20:10.03]The sewage retreats from your onslaught of attacks.
[20:12.23]Either that or it kept floating by.
[20:13.67]Probably your attacks, though.
[20:15.17]You feel like you can manage to make your way out of here now, but a weapon would be handy.
[20:20.21]Oh, hey, is that a stick coming down the water?
[20:21.93]Instakill it, please.
[20:22.79]Oh, wait a minute.
[20:24.85]Alright.
[20:28.51]A small mouse.
[20:31.56]As you turn to head to this room's exit, you notice a brown little mouse.
[20:36.88]In a shrill voice, it squeaks,
[20:40.32]Welcome to NGUider.
[20:42.70]I'm Tippy.
[20:44.22]If you're alright, Ed.
[20:46.30]Eddie.
[20:47.14]If you're alright, Ed.
[20:48.86]Oh, I don't think we can do that, Eddie.
[20:51.51]Turning out this annoying mouse's intro, you're hit with a jolt of memory.
[20:55.73]I need to defeat every foe in your path.
[20:58.89]No matter what.
[20:59.77]You can start with this mouse right here.
[21:02.15]What's he got?
[21:03.03]11 million HP.
[21:03.61]I got 25 million.
[21:04.47]You got nothing on me.
[21:05.31]Attack, 1.1 million.
[21:06.81]Defense, 3.1.
[21:07.21]Let's go.
[21:07.43]See you later.
[21:14.09]Done.
[21:15.66]Oh, hi, hello, it's 4G again, so you killed the mouse.
[21:19.05]I guess that means it's time to add some rockin' new gameplay your way.
[21:21.79]First off, you unlocked Adventure.
[21:24.83]Think crappy RPG within the game.
[21:27.56]You'll fight stuff and loot other stuff.
[21:30.20]The training skills you unlock become moves you can use in Adventure to defeat enemies.
[21:35.96]Oh, shit.
[21:36.42]How do you know about that?
[21:38.44]Enemies will spawn randomly every few seconds when you move out of the safe zone.
[21:42.25]Fighting enemies in Adventure will drop gear which you can equip in the snazzy new- By the way, this game's free.
[21:46.49]I need to make that very clear.
[21:49.41]You can just go get it right now on Steam.
[21:50.97]Or play it on Congregate, I believe.
[21:53.79]You just play it.
[21:55.15]Fucking free.
[21:56.79]Who knows if they make you buy stuff, I don't know.
[21:59.85]Somebody just said, it better be.
[22:04.17]What?
[22:04.41]Come on.
[22:10.61]This is fucking, this is a classic.
[22:12.85]This is a classic game.
[22:14.77]And I am offended that you just said that.
[22:18.08]This game's been around for like five years.
[22:21.26]That's back before you even were born.
[22:24.55]You were in diapers when this guy 4G was making this shit.
[22:27.27]Like 15 years ago when he rode around on the back of a napkin.
[22:30.49]This is vintage, all hand-drawn.
[22:35.01]Alright, enemies... They drop gear.
[22:40.15]There's gear in this game.
[22:40.89]There's hats in this game.
[22:41.87]I just made everybody like it.
[22:43.87]Alright.
[22:46.57]You have a new, it's an inventory slot now.
[22:48.32]You know how much shit we're gonna have to take care of?
[22:51.10]Equipment can now boost your stats and adventure and your main attack defense stats and later provide special awesome bonuses.
[22:58.42]You only have the Training Zone unlocked.
[22:59.99]Defeating higher-numbered bosses will eventually unlock new Adventure Zones to play in and get better gear to slap on.
[23:05.95]Also, boss enemies in Adventure have a chance to drop experience.
[23:09.12]Experience is good.
[23:10.60]You've also unlocked Rebirths, which needs some explanation.
[23:13.08]I already know what this does because I sat there for an hour and a half.
[23:19.69]There's a streamer in chat.
[23:21.27]Me.
[23:23.81]Eventually you're going to hit a point, by the way, I want to count how many ResidentSleepers there were.
[23:28.59]There were exactly 1,412.
[23:30.01]So that's 1,412 minutes added to the stream.
[23:32.93]Divided by 40.
[23:33.19]So it was like 30 minutes.
[23:42.36]Eventually, you're going to hit a point where it takes forever to grow stronger.
[23:45.07]If you rebirth, you'll reset most of your progress in each menu, and the bosses will reset.
[23:49.07]However, in return, your number will grow.
[23:51.99]Number is, well, it's a number.
[23:56.18]Your attack and defense get multiplied by number, and your number can get ridiculously big.
[24:03.04]Like, stupid big.
[24:04.34]Like, past-your-mama-jokes big.
[24:07.34]So anytime progress feels slow, it's probably time to rebirth and reset some progress to get your number up.
[24:12.10]You can try rebirthing now if you want, but if you wait longer, your number will even grow even bigger.
[24:17.58]Rebirth time is a big factor, the size of your number, up until 60 minutes.
[24:23.46]I should've just rebirthed at the very beginning.
[24:25.80]You can check how long your rebirth has been going on in the stats menu, cool.
[24:30.20]When you rebirth, bosses will also respawn with a higher number... With a high enough number, you can defeat the high-numbered bosses, which will reward experience every time they defeat.
[24:39.54]Get to boss 17 and you'll unlock another thing.
[24:41.54]See ya.
[24:43.70]Alright, 65 million HP.
[24:44.40]4 million.
[24:44.72]What do you got for defense?
[24:48.60]Mmm, let's... Uh-oh.
[24:51.84]Wiping the mouse guts from between your fingers, you head off down the sewers to make your escape.
[24:54.99]Barely rounding the second corner, you face your next major foe, a slightly bigger mouse.
[24:59.27]You know what to do.
[25:02.88]What do I got for attack?
[25:07.05]I think I'm going to win.
[25:08.59]I should still win.
[25:09.13]I'm not going to run.
[25:14.53]Nuke.
[25:14.73]No, I don't want to nuke.
[25:15.89]Click this button to blast through all those scrub bosses that you can annihilate with a flick of your fingers.
[25:20.36]Your wrist will thank me later.
[25:21.54]I don't want to do that.
[25:24.30]What do you mean I can't win?
[25:27.28]I just destroyed it.
[25:29.34]How much experience do I have?
[25:32.25]Yeah, my defense is going up by the million.
[25:36.22]Uh-oh.
[25:40.83]You start feeling lost in the identical-looking passageways dripping with all sorts of goopy brown waste.
[25:48.27]This is just a shit stream.
[25:50.24]This is a poo stream, I guess.
[25:51.54]You're worrying that you'll never escape these sewers.
[25:54.84]And that every boss you face is just going to be some variation of a rat.
[25:58.00]Cutting off your nose is starting to seem like a good idea, too.
[26:00.59]The stink.
[26:02.21]325 million HP, 32 million attack.
[26:05.93]Uh... Okay, don't die.
[26:09.31]That was close.
[26:11.38]Uh...
[26:14.50]What do I have for inventory?
[26:16.04]Oh, God.
[26:18.22]Item list.
[26:22.55]This has like the same amount of items as Binding of Isaac does.
[26:24.75]Alright.
[26:28.07]Basic training.
[26:31.09]I only have 500.
[26:31.87]Okay, I have to go back.
[26:33.53]I think I have to rebirth.
[26:34.27]I have 20 experience points to spend.
[26:40.75]No, I can't do it.
[26:43.65]Adventure.
[26:47.38]Okay, safe zone.
[26:48.40]Awakening.
[26:51.12]I only have... All I can do is block.
[26:55.35]Blocks 50% of incoming damage for the next three seconds.
[26:57.93]I don't even have an attack.
[27:10.74]Alright, let's go.
[27:11.28]Tutorial zone.
[27:13.18]Idle mode.
[27:14.04]Click to toggle idle mode on and off.
[27:15.50]When on, a stick is attacked.
[27:17.62]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[27:19.78]Automatically attacks every one second.
[27:21.86]While on health regen.
[27:23.46]Alright, let's turn it on.
[27:28.69]Where's my actual... I can't attack?
[27:31.97]Alright, I'm gonna beat the stick.
[27:33.25]HP rack up.
[27:33.71]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[27:36.62]Went on.
[27:36.98]Automatically attacks every one second.
[27:38.94]You get 20% health regen.
[27:40.76]Cannot use any other moves.
[27:41.99]Damage multiplier of 1.2.
[27:43.39]Fighting a stick again.
[27:45.73]I don't have any manual attacks yet.
[27:47.01]Oh, okay.
[27:47.99]What happens if I get to 0 HP?
[27:49.29]Does the game end?
[27:53.41]Uh-oh.
[27:58.02]Uh... I don't think I'm gonna do this.
[28:00.72]I think I'm gonna lose.
[28:01.26]I'm gonna die.
[28:05.66]He's doing too much damage.
[28:07.20]I need, like, a health potion.
[28:08.20]I'm dead.
[28:10.75]A small mouse has defeated you.
[28:11.99]I lost.
[28:15.67]Well... Alright, I got... Hold on.
[28:19.17]This is a different game mode entirely.
[28:22.56]What do I have?
[28:23.44]65 million?
[28:28.76]Requires 5,000 levels in attack to level this up.
[28:37.27]Equipment, okay.
[28:39.21]Use the boosts you find to improve... This is 4G's merge and boost tutorial cube.
[28:44.20]Level 4 accessory.
[28:46.56]Use the boosts you find to improve this item's stats, find additional cubes, and drag onto this item to merge and increase stat caps by 1% per level rounded down.
[28:58.10]1.
[28:59.32]Oh, shit!
[29:00.63]There it is!
[29:01.07]I hope to god it really is just a stick.
[29:04.13]A level 10 weapon.
[29:06.29]Merge extra copies of the stick onto this item to raise its level.
[29:10.41]Each level increases an equipment's max stats by 1% rounded down, up to double the original stats at level 100.
[29:18.85]You can do this a fucking hundred times?
[29:23.48]Oh shit.
[29:25.96]So what does this do?
[29:27.86]Power boost?
[29:28.40]Drag this item onto any equipment.
[29:29.94]Wait.
[29:34.04]To raise its stat by one.
[29:35.60]Raising equipment's current stat to its cap to really... Toughness boost.
[29:39.30]Oh, shit.
[29:39.66]I can put this on a stick.
[29:42.68]Don't waste it.
[29:43.32]Don't waste it.
[29:44.38]Should I not waste it?
[29:47.03]Oh, this is on max power.
[29:47.97]Alright, yeah.
[29:48.61]Fuck it.
[29:49.39]I'm not gonna waste these.
[29:51.41]Alright, cool.
[29:53.05]Let's go back to adventure and see what happens.
[29:54.75]Let's see if we can fight that motherfucker again.
[29:57.93]Now I got a stick.
[30:00.67]13 power.
[30:00.95]Let's go.
[30:01.65]There it is.
[30:06.89]Yeah, you ain't gonna win.
[30:08.10]I got it.
[30:08.56]I got this one.
[30:15.06]This is the train level, if you didn't, uh, ever play this.
[30:17.46]Dropped 952 gold.
[30:20.99]Dropped a cloth hat.
[30:22.35]Aw, yes.
[30:25.29]Wait, what?
[30:26.29]Hold on.
[30:28.33]I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose.
[30:32.12]Hold on a second.
[30:33.60]Regular ti-
[30:36.63]Cloth hat worn out and tattered, but at least it feels soft.
[30:40.39]Merge extra copies so I get one toughness and some health regen.
[30:46.74]Stats breakdown.
[30:47.82]Oh look at all this shit.
[30:49.32]To satisfy all the stats nerds.
[30:53.98]I have so much.
[30:54.58]I gotta wait.
[30:54.98]Hold on.
[30:55.74]Should I um... Alright, adventure.
[31:00.42]Wait, is this at three to three?
[31:01.84]One to the one.
[31:04.13]Fight boss.
[31:04.65]Can I do anything about this yet?
[31:06.27]No.
[31:06.97]This is the wall right now.
[31:08.99]Click on the special prize.
[31:10.59]Special prize.
[31:11.27]Special prize.
[31:11.93]Hold on.
[31:12.81]I got a lot of experience.
[31:14.85]Should I?
[31:15.47]Is this going to reset if I rebirth?
[31:18.48]You're playing an accounting game.
[31:20.18]Yeah.
[31:27.68]Oh, fuck, this is going on fire.
[31:28.78]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[31:29.82]16.
[31:30.45]Total energy power.
[31:31.55]Let's do that one.
[31:32.27]Bang.
[31:34.49]1.1.
[31:35.59]Energy power.
[31:36.15]It means things do better.
[31:37.25]I have numbers that go up.
[31:39.23]That's all I need to know.
[31:39.92]Wait, there's adventure stats.
[31:42.58]Oh, shit.
[31:45.02]Adventure special.
[31:46.76]More inventory spaces.
[31:48.08]Fuck.
[31:51.70]Reg- Levels gained in- Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[31:55.66]Levels gained in this attack skill would decrease the amount of energy needed to cap leveling speed upon rebirth.
[32:01.03]Base attack received per level is a thousand.
[32:03.55]Oh, let's get this fucking thing leveled up then.
[32:09.25]You're gonna get this game?
[32:11.75]Yeah, dude.
[32:13.33]If you like numbers going up, then you might as well get it.
[32:17.83]Look, this is very clear what this stream is.
[32:19.83]Title even says it.
[32:23.89]Let's split this.
[32:24.47]I need some more.
[32:25.19]Hold on.
[32:26.63]Let's do increments of 100.
[32:32.85]Let's do 100, 100, 300.
[32:34.44]I need more defense and HP.
[32:40.66]Is this a clicker?
[32:41.32]This is not really.
[32:43.36]It's more of a management game.
[32:46.22]No, I can't fight this thing.
[32:47.53]I think I should rebirth.
[32:49.41]Rebirth.
[32:53.33]I'm gonna do it.
[32:57.55]Let's go back to adventure.
[32:58.29]Alright, so now I should have... Let me try this one more time.
[33:06.27]Idle mode.
[33:08.37]Floating sewage.
[33:15.74]I feel like I've given up on you.
[33:20.24]What, because I'm playing an idle game?
[33:27.84]What does that mean?
[33:30.52]There was just a carnival last weekend.
[33:33.74]Huh?
[33:38.77]What the fuck?
[33:47.77]You just increased the amount of time I'm gonna play this game by 30 minutes.
[33:51.73]You yourself.
[34:04.35]We're stuck here forever!
[34:23.20]Quick, quick, call the game boring so he adds time.
[34:26.22]That's the fucking 500 IQ play.
[34:27.30]Alright, what do we got?
[34:34.03]Boss battle!
[34:36.37]BOSS BATTLE!
[34:37.85]I can't do it.
[34:45.34]I'm gonna rebirth here in a second.
[34:46.38]Alright, hold on, I got some stuff.
[34:53.84]Oh fuck, there's like four sausages now.
[34:55.53]Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait.
[34:57.79]If I drag these on top of each other, this will be merged.
[35:01.45]Does that do anything?
[35:07.29]Oh, he's playing a clicker game.
[35:12.45]Does he even care anymore?
[35:13.99]Yeah, he does!
[35:38.39]Oh shit, okay.
[35:39.69]3 out of 4 power.
[35:45.39]Guys, I think he hates us all on a personal level.
[35:47.59]I'm personally offending all 3,700 of you.
[36:06.51]We just did a carnival stream like a week and a half ago.
[36:09.18]I think I'm entitled to one cookie clicker stream.
[36:24.84]Thank you, Hurricane Turtle, for the 10 community subs.
[36:26.80]Appreciate it.
[36:39.00]Put on the stick?
[36:39.62]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[36:44.23]Level 65 weapon.
[36:45.01]Wait, wait, wait, I didn't even look at this shit.
[36:47.81]Alright, you just added another hour.
[36:51.63]Uh, there's no bottoms on these.
[36:52.57]It's all worn out.
[36:53.25]Kind of ruins the purpose of these boots, doesn't it?
[36:59.81]Toughness 1.
[37:00.61]Toughness 1.
[37:03.62]I'm just the dirty guy that fell in the sewer.
[37:16.84]Holy shit, I'm doing great.
[37:19.38]I'm gonna just move 69.
[37:20.40]Uh, can I go to- I wanna go to a different zone.
[37:28.70]How do I open up a new zone?
[37:31.81]Cloth shirt.
[37:34.41]Oh fuck, I can merge these.
[37:40.01]I think I have to- I have to beat this.
[37:41.93]I'm not gonna be able to do this.
[37:53.70]Alright, it's time to rebirth.
[37:54.68]Here we go.
[37:56.66]I'm doing it.
[37:57.00]It's been 30 minutes.
[37:58.32]Alright, we're at the time.
[38:00.29]We're at the time here where I have to decide if I'm gonna play this for a while.
[38:06.85]And the answer is yes.
[38:13.62]Anything to do before rebirth.
[38:15.56]Let's go!
[38:15.80]Alright, we're back to zero.
[38:28.51]It's been 25 minutes, it's time to get off the toilet.
[38:31.93]Give me a break.
[38:42.71]You just added an hour to the game!
[38:43.93]Alright, 48,000 attack.
[38:55.20]Wait, I only have 1,000 HP.
[38:57.71]500,000 HP!
[38:58.73]What?!
[38:58.93]I need more... How much HP do I have?
[39:12.06]Alright, so I've rebirthed.
[39:14.40]Which means I get way more... I get more stats per point now.
[39:19.02]And I have a higher energy cap.
[39:25.25]What if this was my first 24 hour stream?
[39:27.45]What if I did that?
[39:29.00]Big mistake.
[39:29.48]What do you mean?
[39:29.90]What am I talking about?
[39:42.80]Look at this.
[39:43.09]Look at how fast that's going up because of the- Wait, I want to see the info.
[39:46.39]Where's the actual stats?
[39:48.83]That's going up so much faster.
[39:55.46]Do it.
[39:55.90]Do it.
[39:56.28]Coward.
[39:56.74]Coward.
[39:57.14]Coward.
[39:57.58]Coward.
[39:57.98]Alright, I got... Let's do it.
[40:05.28]Let's split it evenly.
[40:07.56]100-100.
[40:09.00]I'm on more HP.
[40:10.30]Alright, now let's just murder this guy.
[40:14.32]Bring on the next one.
[40:15.10]Floating piece of shit.
[40:37.18]What you guys don't know is I have been on the toilet this whole time.
[40:40.40]I'm in the bathroom, my whole setup is here.
[40:44.90]Alright, 275, let's do more attack.
[40:47.34]I want this over like 5 million.
[40:51.83]Did you guys ever make magic potions?
[40:53.25]I think we already talked about magic potions, right?
[41:09.27]No, I'm saying, like, in the sink.
[41:11.53]Did you guys- at 5, what, 65 million HP?
[41:13.89]I need some more.
[41:14.41]I gotta- what do I got, 330?
[41:15.47]I need more- I need more help.
[41:21.81]You guys ever did magic potions in the sink?
[41:24.95]You take, like, a small squeeze of shampoo, a little bit of toothpaste, some conditioner, a little bit of, like, spray deodorant, and mix it up.
[41:34.83]And maybe make magic potions.
[41:37.87]If you say you didn't do that, I don't believe you.
[41:40.55]And you know what?
[41:42.13]You've just added 40 minutes to the stream.
[41:47.11]You see the goddamn carnival I did two weeks ago?
[42:07.99]Add a timer.
[42:08.83]I don't have a timer.
[42:09.47]Alright, I think I can do this.
[42:16.27]Not yet.
[42:21.64]Can we get a BRB?
[42:24.70]How long has it been?
[42:25.24]We've been going for 43 minutes.
[42:28.04]By the way, Turtles in Time has a long-ass soundtrack.
[42:31.12]I didn't think it was this long.
[42:32.66]I thought it was like 8 minutes.
[42:33.98]It's been 28 minutes of this.
[42:41.40]65 million.
[42:41.74]Alright, I gotta get more.
[42:42.91]What do I got?
[42:43.91]What's my new cap?
[42:46.37]You will hit your energy cap in 1 minute and 52 seconds.
[42:51.76]I need more HP or something.
[42:53.26]What the fuck do I need?
[43:05.09]Attack.
[43:05.69]No, I want... I want like... I want 50 million HP and then we're gonna go for an attack.
[43:09.37]What do I have for experience?
[43:10.79]Three experience points.
[43:12.33]I want to... You know what?
[43:13.00]Let's make it better for adventure mode.
[43:14.82]I want more base power.
[43:16.48]Bingo.
[43:17.30]14.
[43:17.96]That should make it very easy.
[43:19.84]Alright.
[43:28.37]34 million.
[43:28.85]What's he got for defense?
[43:30.07]3.5.
[43:30.11]I got a lot of attack though.
[43:31.25]What do you think?
[43:32.57]You think I'm gonna do it?
[43:33.15]I think I'm gonna do it.
[43:46.63]Alright, here we go.
[43:47.65]This was the wall last time.
[43:55.06]Train it of its lifeblood.
[43:56.70]That's what the plan is.
[44:00.80]Back to basic training.
[44:02.78]Get it all in attack, actually.
[44:04.92]All of it.
[44:05.85]615 cap.
[44:06.63]I went up by 5.
[44:07.19]I went up by 115.
[44:08.97]Look at that.
[44:11.19]What's this guy got for defense?
[44:12.75]17 million?
[44:13.11]Let's get to like 20 million attack and I'm going to put HP up.
[44:19.41]Experience?
[44:19.83]I don't have any EXP.
[44:24.07]I need to make the cap higher.
[44:27.28]Once you have 100,000 max energy, you'll find you can't gain anymore just by generating energy.
[44:32.40]Why?
[44:32.70]Because I made it that way.
[44:33.66]Alright, let's do Adventure Mode.
[44:39.83]Tutorial Zone.
[44:40.41]How do we get out of the tutorial?
[44:51.07]You get experience every time you kill something.
[44:52.53]I think so.
[44:53.03]Alright, small mouse boss.
[44:55.31]So how do I get to the other zone?
[44:59.13]He's still in the tutorial.
[45:00.63]Laugh out loud, MonkaS.
[45:02.33]Um... I need to tell you guys something very important.
[45:06.60]This, uh... This game... Some people have been continuously playing this game... For three years.
[45:16.32]So... Uh... Whoa.
[45:22.12]Alright, any uh, inventory, what do I got?
[45:24.52]Wait, I get to keep my stuff?
[45:27.54]Oh shit, I'm getting like all these, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, I'm gonna get overwhelmed here.
[45:32.00]Sausage.
[45:33.83]Three out of five, alright.
[45:36.37]Drag this onto any equipment to boost its special by one.
[45:39.41]Should I boost this by one?
[45:44.53]Wait.
[45:46.01]Is this by two?
[45:46.99]What did I just do?
[45:48.21]I just boosted the one to a one.
[45:51.48]What have I done?
[45:53.36]Uh... Equip the cube.
[45:58.56]Oh, fuck.
[45:58.98]I didn't know I could put this on.
[46:02.80]Wait, so should I put this all in the cube?
[46:06.62]I'm still picking up dirty socks.
[46:12.21]Alright, Hurricane Turtle gave 20 community subs.
[46:19.01]I'm almost there.
[46:22.27]Wait.
[46:23.53]Level 87.
[46:24.43]I need to boost this.
[46:28.05]Oh, I ran out of music.
[46:30.73]We might as well move on to Super Mario World OST from Super Nintendo.
[46:34.94]We're in a Super Nintendo mood today.
[46:40.71]Alright.
[46:41.33]Uh, I got a level 100 weapon now.
[46:43.05]3 to 6, I can boost it if I wanted to.
[46:45.45]100, alright, now, wait.
[46:46.53]I have 48 million attack, it's time to do some, uh... I gotta get out, I gotta get over this.
[46:51.11]Basic training, get this off.
[47:08.72]Cap it.
[47:09.10]Let's go.
[47:10.02]Spam that.
[47:15.04]Put every single point in this.
[47:16.71]I need like 300 million HP.
[47:19.63]How do I get more?
[47:20.27]Wait.
[47:20.45]I need to kill stuff.
[47:23.71]Adventure.
[47:24.11]Let's go.
[47:25.51]No, we're still in the tutorial.
[47:27.53]Get me out of the tutorial zone.
[47:28.77]At least he's dropping stuff.
[47:36.86]Where's my money?
[47:39.21]Cloth boots, alright.
[47:41.33]You need to defeat boss seven in, wait, what?
[47:44.93]You need to defeat boss seven in the fight boss menu.
[47:48.05]Oh.
[47:51.12]Shit.
[47:52.68]I have to kill this.
[47:56.02]Holy fuck, I didn't realize how much attack I had.
[47:58.62]I think it's gonna happen.
[48:02.44]He makes all the rooms.
[48:04.16]Well, he's dead.
[48:07.30]Brown slime.
[48:09.12]Boss 7, 162 million attack.
[48:11.32]That's not good.
[48:13.15]Finally, you begin to feel a cool breeze from one path and heading down it, you see a light at the end.
[48:18.45]Just before the exit, a large menacing brown blob seeps out of the nearby walls, ready to fight.
[48:24.11]Well, it's as menacing as a blob of poo can get.
[48:26.16]That's poo.
[48:29.48]Okay.
[48:29.72]So what do you have for defense?
[48:32.10]I'm not going to be able to kill this.
[48:33.24]I need to get what I have to.
[48:36.38]Uh, more socks.
[48:41.00]I feel like I should, no.
[48:43.73]I'm stuck in the, I'm stuck here forever.
[48:45.61]I'm just gonna grind gold.
[48:50.61]This, that, this is 1.6 billion HP.
[48:55.97]What do I have for defense?
[48:57.23]37 million?
[48:57.57]This is gonna kill me instantly.
[48:58.87]Yeah, this is impossible.
[49:02.36]This is not possible.
[49:07.08]Where's my... Fuck.
[49:11.70]Do I have to rebirth again?
[49:12.72]Wait, experience.
[49:16.06]3 EXP.
[49:21.50]I'm gonna rebirth.
[49:22.36]Alright, we're gonna start over.
[49:25.08]What do I get for... I have 11 minutes of rebirth here.
[49:30.80]It's not possible, guys.
[49:33.08]162 million attack?
[49:34.08]I only have... He kills me in two seconds.
[49:37.37]Or, like, three seconds.
[49:38.33]I think he's blocked.
[49:50.63]Give the cube food.
[49:58.32]9 out of 18 max health.
[49:59.66]This is for... Okay.
[50:02.70]Fight boss.
[50:05.58]Jerm of the Cube.
[50:06.08]Jerm of the Cube.
[50:06.62]The Cube.
[50:07.00]The Cube.
[50:08.70]Use the boosts you find to improve this item's... stats.
[50:16.69]And find additional cubes and drag onto this item to merge and increase stat caps by 1% per level.
[50:31.69]Uh... How many times can you... It's level 100.
[50:35.39]So how do I just throw stuff in the trash?
[50:38.03]Right here.
[50:39.51]Use numbers on cube.
[50:41.25]Is that... Should I do that?
[50:44.85]Everyone's gonna scream at me now.
[50:49.83]Special.
[50:53.06]Energy speed, 6 out of 15.
[50:54.22]7% 8%.
[50:54.28]Is this waste?
[51:03.53]9% extra speed and 1 power.
[51:11.24]Toughness.
[51:15.13]Can this thing be merged with another cube?
[51:19.39]Pants.
[51:25.42]Everyone screams, Pants!
[51:27.56]So I can do cube and another cube.
[51:30.87]Alright, well, I used it all.
[51:32.13]So... Let's see.
[51:34.09]I still have to beat this boss, though.
[51:36.31]500 million HP.
[51:37.07]Why is this not going up?
[51:40.13]Oh.
[51:41.03]Because I'm only doing attack right now.
[51:43.00]Wait, what?
[51:50.28]Am I capped out at HP?
[51:58.21]Why am I capped out at HP?
[52:01.24]Wait, what the hell is this?
[52:05.15]Now it's going up.
[52:06.43]Why is it going up?
[52:12.01]Attack is HP.
[52:14.09]What?
[52:14.31]Alright, what do I have?
[52:21.52]56 million.
[52:22.60]Fight.
[52:23.46]I can't even come close.
[52:26.54]Block scales up regen.
[52:27.98]Is that all it does?
[52:33.64]Oh, shit.
[52:37.18]Well, fuck.
[52:37.94]I didn't know that.
[52:42.75]How am I gonna ever hit through this?
[52:46.53]3 experience.
[52:47.05]Let's do... Energy power?
[52:50.41]I need 15.
[52:52.26]Adventure stats.
[52:53.14]Adventure special.
[52:53.84]No, this don't matter until I get... I have to beat the 7th boss.
[53:04.40]What's the cube got?
[53:05.48]6 out of 21 max health?
[53:08.70]It said 5k for a block.
[53:11.37]Why do I say power like that?
[53:12.65]Power.
[53:13.43]Power?
[53:15.07]Power.
[53:15.39]Play adventure.
[53:16.05]I can't.
[53:17.07]You need to defeat boss 7 in the fight boss to move on.
[53:20.17]I can't leave the tutorial until I beat this guy.
[53:22.19]I'm gonna have to rebirth.
[53:26.69]Power.
[53:31.23]What's wrong with saying power?
[53:35.25]How do you say it?
[53:37.85]Uh, auto-merge, auto-boost.
[53:41.47]Well, not yet.
[53:42.01]I wanna see.
[53:44.55]Combined stick.
[53:48.93]It's not gonna do anything, though.
[53:52.39]Little 65 chest.
[53:55.86]Hurry the fuck up!
[53:56.42]Hurry the fuck up!
[53:57.06]Hurry the fuck up!
[54:02.52]Alright, I'm good.
[54:05.93]86 million.
[54:07.97]I need to get to defense 87 million.
[54:11.27]Now I can... At least now I can hurt it.
[54:15.42]Kind of.
[54:17.06]I'm gonna stay for the Mario music.
[54:21.28]Thanks for watching this treat.
[54:22.16]Appreciate it.
[54:25.06]You just added 15 more minutes.
[54:32.94]No, I can't.
[54:34.10]I don't have enough attack.
[54:42.17]Play a second idle game by playing this one.
[54:45.13]No, I don't have the kind of brainpower for that.
[54:52.08]I think I have to rebirth.
[54:54.80]After killing this thing is the last thing I'm going to do.
[54:57.92]And then I'm going to rebirth and I'm going to do it again.
[55:02.28]You just have to AFK.
[55:03.08]You don't need brainpower.
[55:06.35]Says you.
[55:08.17]I need all the brainpower I can get.
[55:12.11]Regular attack.
[55:14.57]Oh, nice.
[55:14.97]Hold on.
[55:17.99]Hold on.
[55:18.25]What's base attack on this one?
[55:19.25]Base attack received per level is 150.
[55:20.07]Oh, well, uh, yeah.
[55:45.37]I need to get... Oh, defense.
[55:46.69]Right.
[55:46.89]I have to get to 5,000 defense.
[55:48.06]You're right.
[55:54.52]What do I got?
[55:56.36]113 million.
[55:58.72]Ah!
[55:59.04]It's not there yet.
[56:02.01]It's almost there.
[56:02.81]Hurry up.
[56:06.55]You're invincible.
[56:07.27]I'm not invincible.
[56:08.25]I'm very killable.
[56:11.28]Auto-merge.
[56:13.08]Auto-boost.
[56:14.34]You need to unlock auto-boost.
[56:16.02]I can't even toggle these.
[56:19.24]You need to buy auto-merge in the EXP menu.
[56:22.16]I can't do this.
[56:26.32]I'm not allowed to auto-merge.
[56:29.22]I have to do it by hand.
[56:33.77]115 million attack.
[56:34.51]Come on, let's go.
[56:39.77]Damn it.
[56:43.56]I just need to kill this guy.
[56:53.31]Stick can't go over 100.
[56:54.23]Yeah.
[56:56.55]What does the nuke button do?
[56:57.57]I believe the nuke button... Now, somebody correct me if this is incorrect.
[57:01.43]I believe the nuke button means you can skip... Whatever you're capable of killing.
[57:09.20]Right?
[57:10.96]Wrong.
[57:13.83]This is wrong.
[57:15.01]Wrong.
[57:15.35]Incorrect.
[57:15.85]Nuke just auto-completes easy bosses.
[57:17.39]That's exactly what I said.
[57:24.09]You're impatient in an idle game.
[57:28.82]It skips to the next game.
[57:31.32]If I put on the facecam, will you guys relax?
[57:33.84]I just want you guys to relax.
[57:35.54]We're just relaxing.
[57:41.63]You guys need to relax with me.
[57:46.93]We're gonna get to 1.6 billion.
[57:58.63]Show auto.
[58:07.08]The numbers are getting too big.
[58:08.26]100 million is not that big when it comes to space.
[58:15.22]There's space levels of numbers in this game.
[58:23.02]Alright, here's what we're gonna do.
[58:26.28]Here's what we're gonna do.
[58:29.17]We're gonna keep playing this, but I'm gonna play the lava game, too.
[58:32.81]I'm gonna play them both at the same time.
[58:40.35]In between levels, I'm gonna switch.
[58:42.63]Because I wanna do this!
[58:47.25]How much defense do I have?
[58:53.00]Unfortunately, the music has to stop, though.
[58:56.88]Uh-oh.
[58:58.44]Defensive buff.
[59:01.34]Base defense for Steve doesn't... Ooh.
[59:08.91]Shit, I want to spam that.
[59:10.01]Thousand base defense.
[59:15.06]How much do I have right now?
[59:15.80]Let me just kill this fucking thing.
[59:18.06]162 million.
[59:20.26]Alright, let's go.
[59:21.58]It's gonna be close.
[59:29.95]I'm gonna lose.
[59:34.87]Fuck.
[59:35.41]I need a little bit more.
[59:36.43]Just a little bit more.
[59:37.73]I need more attack.
[59:40.04]Defense is alright.
[59:41.02]I need more attack.
[59:43.82]Just only attack.
[59:45.00]Just get it up there.
[59:45.84]Come on.
[59:46.28]Hurry up.
[59:49.43]Attack and HP is it.
[59:50.75]107 defense.
[59:59.73]Alright, now let's only do defense.
[60:02.85]I'm just going all in.
[60:05.49]Sometimes you have to go all in completely.
[60:09.39]You lied about facecam.
[60:10.90]No, I'm moving to hot lava.
[60:16.96]You regen faster.
[60:21.98]Oh, shit.
[60:23.72]Holy shit, you're right.
[60:26.07]So you lied about the facecam.
[60:31.45]You really want me to put on the facecam?
[60:33.87]Is that what you want?
[60:36.45]Let me kill this.
[60:43.75]Come on.
[60:44.41]Who's going down faster?
[60:45.43]Who's counting down faster?
[60:46.35]Is it me or them?
[60:49.54]Ugh, it's even!
[60:50.92]Completely!
[60:58.50]Hurry up!
[61:07.35]How much is he regenning?
[61:11.47]I gotta regen over what you're regening, and then go again.
[61:17.99]Put your face as the boss.
[61:22.23]Hold on.
[61:37.02]I'm getting addicted.
[61:37.92]Uh-oh.
[61:41.80]Uh-oh.
[61:50.94]Uh-oh, here it is.
[61:52.04]I did it!
[61:53.70]He's dead.
[61:54.18]We don't need to play another game.
[61:57.95]I did it!
[61:58.83]You defeated Brown Slime.
[62:00.45]You've unlocked a new adventure zone, the Sewers.
[62:02.23]Go to Adventure Feature and check it out.
[62:04.48]I'm addicted.
[62:04.90]We don't need to play any other game.
[62:06.16]You finally escape, gasping your first breaths of fresh air in who knows how long.
[62:10.38]You shield your eyes for a moment from the bright sun.
[62:12.48]Once your eyes adapt to the light, you see a gorgeous green field stretched out before you, leading up to a forest.
[62:21.26]You can feel the gloom seeping into every branch.
[62:23.27]As you approach the path leading to the forest, a spooky skeleton emerges from the ground.
[62:27.14]Armed with a trumpet.
[62:29.22]You try not to get distracted by its jazzy tunes while you smash it to dust.
[62:32.50]This thing is not going to be killable now.
[62:39.58]But I did unlock an adventure zone.
[62:42.21]Oh my god, my inventory is a mess.
[62:45.67]This is the same inventory that I have when I play Minecraft.
[62:50.81]I keep so much useless shit.
[62:52.41]And I have to merge all this.
[62:56.95]I don't even want these sticks anymore.
[63:08.89]I have to... No, I'm gonna... That's the first thing I'm gonna buy.
[63:10.63]I'm gonna buy... Ooh.
[63:12.67]I'm gonna buy auto-merge immediately upon rebirth.
[63:15.61]Are we almost maxed out?
[63:19.06]Four.
[63:19.30]Alright, hold on.
[63:22.26]Adventure.
[63:23.38]Let's go to the sewers.
[63:25.28]Let's check it out.
[63:31.83]I'm just sweeping.
[63:33.01]I'm absolutely stomping right now.
[63:34.15]1800 gold.
[63:34.85]Alright.
[63:35.19]Hold on.
[63:35.43]I'll put it on the face game in like a couple hours.
[63:38.19]I don't even know how to turn it on.
[63:41.00]I'm using a new streamlabs.
[63:41.96]I have no idea.
[63:48.82]Uh-oh.
[63:54.09]Brown slime.
[63:56.01]We're gonna get some good gear from this one.
[64:02.73]Alright, you guys get to pick.
[64:03.61]We either play Hot Lava or you get a facecam.
[64:06.03]Which one do you want?
[64:11.39]2900 gold.
[64:12.23]Nice.
[64:13.25]Big rat.
[64:15.49]Both.
[64:15.81]Well, I'll end up doing both eventually here.
[64:18.87]We're just doing the pre-stream.
[64:25.51]Guys, I just got off the plane from TwitchCon like four days ago.
[64:29.84]I need some time.
[64:30.22]I'm dead.
[64:38.33]Ooh, a new dirty shirt.
[64:39.33]Put it on.
[64:41.94]Guys, I just got off the plane from San Diego like five days ago.
[64:45.36]Like, I'm fucking... I just need some time.
[64:48.52]We need to play an idle game for a little bit.
[64:50.10]Alright, I lost.
[65:00.52]It's time to rebirth.
[65:05.93]I think so.
[65:07.47]I'm doing it.
[65:08.37]Fuck it.
[65:09.27]I'm doing it.
[65:12.27]Boss power bonus is going from 2 to the 7th power, 128.
[65:15.60]Boss power bonus, last rebirth, 2 to the 5th power, 35.
[65:18.98]Current number, number on rebirth, 120.
[65:21.36]Time factor, training level factor.
[65:26.48]Nothing you need to do, go ahead and rebirth.
[65:31.27]Okay.
[65:31.77]I'm gonna have 121 times.
[65:35.11]Let's go.
[65:36.11]Difficulty normal.
[65:37.09]I ain't doing that.
[65:37.93]Rebirth.
[65:38.53]Bang.
[65:39.09]Did it.
[65:39.85]Good.
[65:40.89]Nice.
[65:45.05]Nice.
[65:45.81]Alright, I'll get you.
[65:46.57]You deserve a facecam for that.
[65:49.41]You do.
[65:49.71]It's gonna be real.
[65:58.84]You deserve it.
[65:59.48]I'll give it to you.
[66:01.54]Alright, for every ResidentSleeper that I see in the chat, I remove a minute from the facecam.
[66:10.83]What are you gonna do now?
[66:17.07]Alright.
[66:20.20]Get this out of here.
[66:27.09]Let's just change categories into just chatting now and just do an Ask Me Anything.
[66:32.03]Right?
[66:32.29]Like, how big do... Okay, I can be, like, this big.
[66:35.85]Oh, shit.
[66:36.11]I could be... I could be... I could be this big right now on stream.
[66:46.58]That's a good track.
[66:48.30]Alright.
[66:49.94]What's next?
[66:50.72]I rebirthed.
[66:51.70]So we're gonna do basic training.
[66:52.76]I got my... Let's go back to the live view.
[67:00.48]Star Wars!
[67:01.13]Alright, the cap.
[67:05.49]I'll have to redo this again.
[67:13.01]No, don't.
[67:14.61]I'll knock something off.
[67:16.04]I'll break something.
[67:18.64]I fucking love Star Wars.
[67:19.92]This is not gonna go the way that you think.
[67:28.77]This is like the best song in the whole entire fucking Mario catalog of songs.
[67:35.43]Alright, 10 million attack.
[67:37.13]Need gold!
[67:37.91]Get loads of gold to unlock this!
[67:40.00]More unlockables!
[67:44.28]Shh!
[67:47.06]Alright.
[67:49.14]Let's just fight boss.
[67:50.55]Should I just nuke?
[67:51.73]I mean, I'm at 18 million attack.
[67:53.33]Should we just snap all these guys out of here?
[67:58.01]Oh shit, I can't be this big.
[68:00.51]I can't be this big.
[68:01.11]You can't see the health bar.
[68:04.40]Gonna have to shrink it.
[68:14.48]I can't be here either.
[68:16.72]I can't know.
[68:17.88]Look what happens if I do that.
[68:20.11]That fucks this whole thing up.
[68:24.09]That fucks up the whole thing.
[68:32.97]God damn it.
[68:33.53]I can't.
[68:34.01]I can't do it.
[68:35.19]It's too much... Nope, I can't do it.
[68:38.73]I was going to get hurt and have that song play right now.
[68:42.90]This thing.
[68:44.56]I was like, what is over here that I could get hurt with?
[68:46.38]I don't even know where it is.
[68:52.07]Here it is.
[68:52.35]I was going to have something fall and drop and hit me in the head and lean on me like, oh no.
[68:58.03]What happened?
[68:59.49]Oh shit, he got hurt.
[69:07.59]And he died!
[69:13.10]He took a hurt.
[69:13.66]Yeah, it was made out of fucking Play-Doh.
[69:19.02]Let's go back to the song.
[69:20.12]Alright, what was I doing?
[69:24.37]Good idea, poor execution.
[69:25.83]Sometimes you think of something that you want to do, and then like... 15 seconds go by and you're like, wait a minute.
[69:34.53]I wanna do that.
[69:35.55]And then you don't.
[69:36.55]It's alright.
[69:37.13]Nuke everybody.
[69:39.55]I only have 20,000 HP?
[69:43.83]Oh, fuck.
[69:44.33]Wait, what am I- Why is it so low?
[69:48.03]It's really low for me.
[69:49.41]What did I do?
[69:49.89]Oh, that's why.
[70:00.18]Because my headphones got, like, unplugged.
[70:01.58]Okay, now that's better.
[70:06.59]Alright, uh, I need... to go... I need to exp- oh wait, back to training.
[70:13.33]Five- what's- 570 to cap?
[70:14.19]Let's get a 317, there we go.
[70:23.24]Now you can't hear it.
[70:23.98]Yeah you can, it's fine.
[70:24.92]You can hear that.
[70:30.34]What does Sour Please mean?
[70:31.54]It means dance.
[70:33.60]It's like a I'm dancing thing.
[70:41.27]I don't know, I just learned about that, like, two or three months ago, so.
[70:48.16]You can't lie, this idle game has a really good soundtrack.
[70:52.84]I mean, it does, it does.
[70:53.98]It's a pretty good soundtrack.
[70:55.06]Nuke this guy.
[70:55.58]Alright, that's pretty cool that you can do that.
[71:00.12]I have to fight the mouse, though.
[71:06.14]We're over the cap right now, that's good.
[71:08.77]Move this over.
[71:11.99]Fix the facecam location.
[71:18.24]Isn't that... Isn't this where you wanted it?
[71:21.32]I thought it was supposed to be right here.
[71:22.44]Is it... It's not fine there?
[71:27.45]It should be.
[71:30.15]I mean, you can't see how much energy is being allocated.
[71:36.42]Put it over here.
[71:36.92]What about... There's nowhere for it to go.
[71:41.28]Look, let me show you.
[71:42.12]What if it was down here?
[71:45.43]That's not a bad place for it.
[71:50.13]That's fine.
[71:51.11]That's fine.
[71:51.97]I want to see the artwork.
[71:52.91]It's not going to be my face for every single boss.
[71:56.72]I'm sorry.
[71:58.38]Come on.
[72:04.71]Okay.
[72:06.07]I have a... Let's get rid of... Okay, that was instant.
[72:09.97]That almost hurt my eyes.
[72:12.25]Gone.
[72:12.69]Alright.
[72:13.91]This is why you rebirth.
[72:14.73]How much experience do I have?
[72:15.75]Ten.
[72:19.21]I want energy power.
[72:21.46]This upgrade improves the effectiveness of your allocated energy.
[72:24.82]This means faster progress on features while using less energy.
[72:34.97]I don't have enough.
[72:41.38]I love this game.
[72:41.92]I'm playing it right now.
[72:42.70]Thanks.
[72:45.48]Why'd I say thanks?
[72:54.27]Like, oh, thanks.
[72:54.93]Yeah, I like this too.
[72:56.87]Thanks.
[72:58.01]I don't know.
[72:58.61]I have no idea.
[73:01.20]I'm gonna do that.
[73:03.48]Should I do more base energy speed?
[73:05.02]I don't think that's... That's not doing... You know what?
[73:12.53]We're going all in on attack.
[73:13.93]For now.
[73:15.91]Pull this all out.
[73:16.89]Cap the whole thing.
[73:19.23]778 points.
[73:21.99]Fight the boss.
[73:23.01]Boom.
[73:23.90]Remember how long this took last time?
[73:25.40]This was such a fucking pain in the ass last time, and now we're at the skeleton trumpet.
[73:35.43]Although I have to wait for this one.
[73:38.49]Time for Adventure Mode.
[73:40.29]What do I have for... Inventory, okay.
[73:45.11]This is unchanged.
[73:46.97]Adventure.
[73:48.31]Sewers.
[73:49.27]Let's go.
[73:51.55]Put on the Doom Eternal OS2.
[73:57.83]The actual dev is here?
[74:01.09]Actual dev in chat.
[74:03.95]This game's fucking fun.
[74:06.20]I'm already addicted.
[74:07.06]I didn't know if I, you know, I crossed the path where I didn't think I was going to get addicted.
[74:10.20]I wasn't sure.
[74:12.02]And everyone here is addicted too.
[74:14.42]So this is what we're doing.
[74:25.41]Let's get some Skyrim OST on here.
[74:27.67]I think that fits.
[74:32.23]Oh, did I have any inventory?
[74:34.57]Ooh, what's this?
[74:35.21]Crappy helmet level 4.
[74:36.49]1 out of 5.
[74:39.79]And better health regen.
[74:41.67]Oh, get this out of here.
[74:43.33]That's much better.
[74:44.25]Throw it away.
[74:45.05]Wait, should I throw this away?
[74:45.93]I'm gonna hold on to it.
[74:46.83]Throw it away.
[74:53.11]Alright, we got 2.5... 800 million attack.
[74:59.50]Basic training.
[74:59.98]Let's go back here.
[75:01.20]Oh, I'm just stomping in here.
[75:02.34]That's fine.
[75:07.01]Level every item to 100.
[75:11.61]I'll give it a try.
[75:16.45]I do want more... I need more defense.
[75:19.07]Let me get this to 5,000 first.
[75:20.69]And then I'm going to put 100 points... Wait, listen.
[75:24.21]100 points are going to go here.
[75:25.77]And then 670 are going to go down here.
[75:33.80]I think that's a good idea.
[75:38.43]Once an item gets to level 100, you need to start putting the boosts into them.
[75:44.25]Fuck, okay.
[75:48.55]Jerma... Okay, um...
[76:01.22]Why is the block not going up?
[76:02.34]Because I don't have any energy in it.
[76:03.87]I'm just trying to spam this until I get to a point where I'm going to bring it down.
[76:06.91]Because one level of idle attack is worth 150.
[76:13.35]One level of regular attack is worth 1,000.
[76:17.01]So that's how you play the math there.
[76:20.84]Let's spam this one now.
[76:21.86]678.
[76:22.72]Spam it.
[76:22.94]Wait, cap.
[76:23.30]So that's as fast as it can possibly go.
[76:31.00]So 549 is as fast as I can do it.
[76:32.91]I think I broke it.
[76:39.67]Did I break it?
[76:42.17]Because when I do, like, for instance, ready?
[76:43.53]Like, cap.
[76:46.47]Cap, like, the cap seems to be different.
[76:48.16]Like, why is it different?
[76:52.70]Cap just puts all your idle energy into it.
[76:54.42]Alright, well let's do this for a little bit.
[76:56.10]I got 1.2 billion attack.
[76:57.80]Fight the boss.
[76:58.50]He's got 8.1 billion HP.
[77:01.12]He's got 4.37.500 million.
[77:04.20]He's dead.
[77:06.56]I think I can ride it out.
[77:08.64]I think I can ride it out.
[77:09.46]Skeleton's about to go down.
[77:12.26]Boys and girls, Skeleton's about to go down.
[77:13.91]Can I get some hype in the chat, please?
[77:15.35]I don't even fucking think about it.
[77:25.29]Goblin!
[77:27.87]Seek out the wizard further on, you hear sighing from the pulverized bone dust.
[77:32.53]Now swept away by the wind, you venture past, thankful for the advice, though unsure where to go other than deeper into this rather sinister-looking forest.
[77:41.76]Before long, you sense something above you, and dart out of the way just before a tiny, pock-marked figure falls onto the ground where you were.
[77:50.88]Uh-oh!
[77:52.02]Droop's in trouble!
[77:53.16]The goblin shrieks in a gross, nasally voice.
[78:00.23]The facecam needs to be moved back.
[78:01.47]I can read that to you, it's okay.
[78:05.85]So he's got 4.4 billion to 40 billion HP.
[78:08.25]40 billion HP.
[78:17.64]Okay.
[78:19.26]I love that it's still a what-the-fuck-do-I-do button.
[78:23.56]I need to get more shit in the adventure mode.
[78:26.38]Back to the sewers.
[78:26.90]Let's go.
[78:28.71]Idle mode.
[78:29.91]Activated.
[78:32.29]Small mouse.
[78:35.95]Base camp would be better in the bottom right.
[78:39.01]This is the bottom right.
[78:39.91]Alright, bronze slime.
[78:42.31]Let's get poison.
[78:43.66]Two poison damage.
[78:50.33]No, bottom left.
[78:51.43]I want some more coffee.
[78:53.31]Should I go get some more coffee?
[78:56.71]Ooh, I got a cracked amulet.
[79:00.11]Wait.
[79:04.01]Cracked amulet.
[79:04.69]I need to see what that does.
[79:09.52]This one isn't covered in poo.
[79:10.82]This is a bunch of poo, but it's brown anyways.
[79:13.18]Feels like the useful in combat.
[79:15.62]That's pretty good.
[79:18.36]That's actually really good.
[79:23.86]What am I doing in my training here?
[79:26.18]Yeah.
[79:26.78]That's good.
[79:27.38]Just keep that... You know what?
[79:28.68]Do this.
[79:30.22]Just to keep this kind of even here.
[79:33.12]I ignored subs.
[79:34.12]I didn't see them.
[79:34.58]Where are they?
[79:40.36]What is this game actually called?
[79:41.80]It's called NGU Idol.
[79:45.36]It's on Steam.
[79:45.92]It's free to play.
[79:47.53]Did I miss subs?
[79:50.81]Did I?
[79:51.31]I... I don't see them.
[79:57.92]How many?
[79:59.48]How many were there?
[80:00.10]Because they're not here.
[80:01.02]The dev gifted subs.
[80:04.76]Was 10?
[80:06.10]Why is this not here?
[80:08.86]Paraguay just gave 10 community subs.
[80:13.50]That was 10 from before, too.
[80:17.28]That's 20.
[80:18.60]So that's the dev of this game.
[80:20.84]I need that confirmed by somebody.
[80:23.33]I need that to be confirmed.
[80:28.33]Yes.
[80:31.77]What's going on?
[80:34.63]That's all I have to say.
[80:35.89]Hey, what's up?
[80:38.13]Cool game.
[80:39.85]Uh, but thank you for the 20 community subs.
[80:41.53]That means a lot.
[80:43.25]It's an interesting concept.
[80:44.27]It's a fun game.
[80:46.39]I'm liking it.
[80:50.37]Let's just keep this down here now.
[80:52.05]Uh, and then right after that, Demons V gave 5,500 bits.
[80:59.22]And they said, Uh, I think you're really talented.
[81:25.56]Well, I'm really sorry to hear about the first part here, the chronic pain.
[81:29.50]I can't imagine how much that must suck.
[81:32.51]As somebody that also deals with chronic illness, it's not fun.
[81:36.97]So, I know what that's like.
[81:40.19]Thank you for the 5,500 fucking bits.
[81:44.64]And sorry for waking you up, but sometimes you gotta wake people up.
[81:47.65]Like, for instance, right now, we've been streaming for an hour and 25 minutes.
[81:51.37]And I know for a fact that there's, let's say, there's 40, almost 4,500 people there.
[81:55.13]I know at least 1,000 people fell asleep.
[81:57.13]So I have to wake them up.
[82:00.36]In probably the best possible way, I think.
[82:05.34]Dude, what the fuck?
[82:06.34]No fucking way.
[82:07.90]No fucking way.
[82:08.54]There's free money coming through right now.
[82:10.14]The screen.
[82:11.82]You just have to click the screen?
[82:13.09]There's free money there?
[82:14.19]No way.
[82:15.13]No fucking way.
[82:16.64]I just got $100!
[82:18.24]I just got $200!
[82:18.64]You gotta be kidding me!
[82:27.67]Welcome back.
[82:29.65]Um... What's his message say?
[82:34.07]Hey Jerma, I just had a weird dream that you were screaming in the mic about free money and stuff.
[82:40.22]That's weird.
[82:41.26]Welcome back, though.
[82:43.04]If you were sleeping.
[82:46.50]That's weird.
[82:48.59]Free?
[82:49.23]What do you mean free money?
[82:51.03]That's odd.
[82:54.83]Hope you had a good nap, I guess.
[83:02.15]Okay.
[83:03.47]Uh, so!
[83:05.17]I, what do we got?
[83:06.69]Let's go fight boss.
[83:08.11]40 billion, 13 billion.
[83:09.17]What do you got for attack?
[83:10.43]1.3 billion.
[83:11.13]Defense, 2 billion.
[83:12.49]This ain't gonna work out.
[83:13.93]Uh, we're gonna go to adventure mode.
[83:15.25]What do I got for my inventory?
[83:16.85]Not gonna work out.
[83:17.91]I need more gold.
[83:18.57]How much gold do I have?
[83:19.39]That's not gonna work out either.
[83:24.65]Time to rebirth.
[83:27.19]I need something.
[83:27.65]There's nothing in this.
[83:29.13]There is nothing in this container.
[83:31.21]Hello?
[83:32.29]Nobody in there.
[83:32.97]I need to refill that.
[83:42.57]Wait, also drop 4Gs, Merge and Boost Tutorial Cube.
[83:55.83]Alright.
[83:56.87]So if I put these together, what happens?
[84:03.32]Uh-oh, that was a mistake.
[84:14.82]Oh well.
[84:16.10]Alright, let's go.
[84:16.94]Sewers.
[84:18.10]More loot.
[84:19.08]More idle equipment.
[84:22.51]You've ruined it.
[84:23.03]Reset.
[84:23.57]I can rebirth in like 15 minutes.
[84:26.20]Increases the cap of all the skills.
[84:27.86]That's alright.
[84:28.62]That's cool.
[84:29.26]Got 1800 gold.
[84:29.70]How much gold do I need?
[84:30.74]Do I need... Change the fucking music?
[84:42.78]Hold on.
[84:49.19]We'll put on peaceful piano music.
[85:16.79]you
[87:16.42]I just had a fucking craze.
[87:19.22]Colonel Sanders was just chasing me in a fucking pool with a chainsaw.
[87:21.82]I was trying to swim the fuck away, and then he was behind me with a fucking chainsaw.
[87:31.13]And, like, he stuck it through my chest.
[87:37.73]Well, did I make it?
[87:38.49]It's been seven and a half hours.
[87:45.46]Did I do it?
[87:50.76]I did it!
[87:55.51]No, not quite.
[87:56.39]Not quite there yet.
[87:58.75]Not there?
[87:59.21]Another 45 minutes?
[88:16.13]He's wearing lipstick.
[88:18.81]Why did this happen?
[88:27.64]This is fucking scary.
[88:31.32]He's got white walker eyes.
[88:39.35]Hold on a second.
[89:28.11]It's trying to correct it, is what it's doing.
[89:33.12]It's on auto and it's correcting it.
[89:43.71]It's like, patient zero!
[89:49.41]This is like the part of the movie where they, like, I was an actor in the movie, right?
[89:53.80]And over the course of maybe like 30, 40 minutes, I'm like the funny guy and the funny character that's in the zombie apocalypse movie.
[90:01.19]And I start getting sick.
[90:04.65]And after, you know, I go get quarantined in like the fucking shop behind us.
[90:11.19]And I'm the first person to turn.
[90:12.92]And it's like, oh no.
[90:16.08]Not the funny guy.
[90:17.02]Not the guy that was making all those funny jokes during the whole movie.
[90:21.74]And I'm not funny anymore.
[90:23.44]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[90:27.40]Now I'm out for fucking blood.
[90:42.02]I fucked this whole camera up.
[90:42.96]I don't even know what to do now.
[90:51.12]This fucking music's been playing the whole time in the background.
[90:56.95]I... I don't know.
[90:57.53]I can't fix it.
[91:12.80]Now I'm not doing the sleep thing again.
[91:14.28]I need to fix the webcam.
[91:23.43]Hey, there we go.
[91:24.27]Hi.
[91:25.73]I look better than I did before.
[91:29.79]Don't have a wink.
[91:35.30]How much XP did I get?
[91:43.90]Funny.
[91:45.48]The funny guy.
[91:49.70]I got my eye on you.
[91:55.78]I'm noticing how triangular his face is.
[92:02.36]I got my eye on you.
[92:04.86]Alright, let's go back to what we were doing.
[92:10.49]Uh, have I just been... Oh, shit!
[92:13.79]Wait!
[92:18.63]Put on Kirby?
[92:19.65]Sure.
[92:21.21]What do you want?
[92:21.61]Kirby is...
[92:23.90]We got Kirby's Adventure, Kirby's Epic Yarn, Kirby's Dream Land, Kirby's Epic Yarn OST, Kirby's Dream Course, Kirby's Adventure OST, Kirby's Dream Land 3, Kirby's Dream Land 3 OST, Kirby's Dream Super Star, Air Ride.
[92:36.73]There's a lot here.
[92:38.69]Kirby's Air Ride OST.
[92:45.32]Cool.
[92:45.90]Alright.
[92:46.98]Alright.
[92:47.72]Cool.
[92:50.62]Nice.
[92:56.53]This is what you want?
[92:57.55]This is what you wanted, right?
[93:01.71]Alright.
[93:09.82]Okay.
[93:11.08]Gross Ring, level 4.
[93:13.44]Wait, what is this one?
[93:14.46]Combine them.
[93:16.90]0 out of 1.
[93:17.12]0 out of 3.
[93:18.44]Toughness 0 out of 1.
[93:19.34]Health regen.
[93:19.94]1, 3, 1.
[93:27.12]Not as good.
[93:27.80]What about this one?
[93:30.30]This is 1 out of 5.
[93:31.12]That's just kind of scary.
[93:33.72]1 out of 5.
[93:34.88]315.
[93:35.84]Level 4.
[93:36.44]It's now level 9.
[93:37.16]Get it up there again.
[93:42.34]I've got the noob cube still on.
[93:43.56]That's good.
[93:47.80]So, in this... Have I really capped out here?
[93:50.32]What am I putting my points into?
[93:57.06]Really?
[93:58.70]Only three and a half billion?
[94:02.37]That's kind of bullshit.
[94:05.71]Oh, that's a baseline I can get behind.
[94:07.19]Alright, okay, what is this?
[94:12.23]Let's see.
[94:14.47]No.
[94:14.55]I think that's a rebirth.
[94:23.78]That's meaty.
[94:24.42]Yeah, that's a meaty base.
[94:27.61]2018.
[94:27.67]This should just go down easily.
[94:34.43]Poison.
[94:34.95]It's alright.
[94:37.37]No enemies.
[94:37.81]Alright.
[94:38.05]You got the tutorial cube.
[94:40.85]Sewers.
[94:41.67]Big rat.
[94:42.93]Kill it.
[94:45.30]You can't see it.
[94:45.90]I have to make it smaller.
[94:47.06]I know you can't see it.
[94:48.28]I know.
[94:51.58]I'm trying.
[94:52.12]I know.
[94:54.76]Bronze Lion boss.
[94:55.54]Die.
[95:03.07]Got it.
[95:03.35]2900 gold.
[95:04.95]Cracked amulet.
[95:07.49]Small mouse.
[95:08.45]Kill it.
[95:09.99]How much more gold do I need?
[95:15.07]Slightly bigger mouse.
[95:20.57]Move my camera into the bottom left.
[95:23.19]And flip it.
[95:24.11]I see what you're saying.
[95:26.41]Try it.
[95:26.95]See how it looks.
[95:39.52]That like seems strange though.
[95:40.80]I'm like flipped the wrong way.
[95:44.96]I'm wearing a rats t-shirt now.
[95:51.71]Alright, I'm low on money.
[95:52.69]Need gold.
[95:53.61]Get loads of gold.
[95:54.51]I don't even know how much I have.
[95:55.49]How much gold do I even own?
[95:58.27]I don't know.
[96:06.88]I don't fucking know.
[96:10.61]rat wars rats wars uh Ben folds people could be giving a lot of money today every start of the kirby's soundtrack startles me I don't know if I want to listen to it anymore um but Ben folds gave 10 000 bits
[96:32.49]They say Jerma's holding my bits hostage until I give him more money.
[96:35.93]Not true.
[96:36.49]But thank you for the $100.
[96:38.47]It's 10,000 bits.
[96:41.20]Jerma, I think you didn't see my last bits, but just want to say that you're my favorite streamer and you've gotten me through a lot of rough patches.
[96:49.06]I can always count on you to brighten my day.
[96:50.32]Jerma Hart.
[96:53.54]Jerma Hart right back at you.
[96:55.71]Thank you for the 10,000 bits.
[96:57.07]That's a shitload of money.
[96:59.96]Thank you.
[97:01.20]I'm just kicking ass in here.
[97:03.81]I gotta beat boss 17 to advance to the next level.
[97:06.45]Are you kidding me?
[97:07.01]How am I gonna do that?
[97:10.65]But, thank you.
[97:11.27]Seriously.
[97:13.89]Also, Lunchmeat just gave 5 community subs.
[97:15.87]Thanks a lot, Lunchmeat.
[97:17.65]Welcome to the stream.
[97:19.75]Anybody that's just joining us.
[97:26.47]2700 gold.
[97:26.79]Alright, it's time.
[97:28.46]We're rebirthing here.
[97:30.53]We are re-birthing.
[97:36.47]Too bald to work.
[97:46.83]Uh, money pit!
[97:51.70]Is this Kingdom Hearts or what is this?
[97:55.38]Money pit.
[97:56.36]Bottomless pit.
[97:57.00]Just throw all your heart and gold into it.
[97:58.92]What?
[98:00.08]The pit is hungry.
[98:00.86]Click it to feed it all your gold.
[98:02.18]This is a daily spin.
[98:09.77]So it doesn't actually spin, but it's random.
[98:11.75]Tier 0 daily spin reward table.
[98:16.90]500 arbitrary points.
[98:18.84]Let's spin the wheel.
[98:29.93]100.
[98:33.81]What?
[98:35.67]That's it?
[98:37.19]Alright, that's it.
[98:38.13]Wait.
[98:38.59]Time until next spin.
[98:39.93]Check the timer.
[98:40.41]Your daily spin's not active yet.
[98:43.74]Feed me.
[98:45.30]Do you want to toss all of your hard-earned gold into the pit?
[98:48.06]Yeah.
[98:49.38]You feel slightly more powerful.
[98:50.60]Plus one to power, to be exact.
[98:53.26]How much money do I have?
[98:55.16]Oh.
[98:57.97]Alright, fight the boss.
[98:58.69]What have we got?
[98:59.41]16 billion, 40 billion.
[99:01.21]1.6 billion, 4 billion.
[99:03.93]I have... My defense is not terrible, but his defense is higher than mine.
[99:08.08]We have to do something else here.
[99:09.16]We gotta... Oh, excuse me.
[99:10.32]No, thank you.
[99:12.08]Put all of the points into here.
[99:13.38]We need to build this up a little bit.
[99:21.33]Oh, this is a good LST.
[99:22.61]Nice choice.
[99:27.78]Not a bad OST.
[99:30.26]I have more than twice as much defense.
[99:33.28]Well, he's got 4 billion attack.
[99:36.30]So... Realistically, he's got, like, 695 million wiggle room there to hurt me.
[99:43.09]And I believe this is, you know, this is, you know... You know what I'm saying?
[99:48.03]Like, if this is higher than this, then it's gonna hurt you.
[99:50.69]But if it's the same, it leaves itself out.
[99:52.75]I don't know how it works.
[99:53.45]I'm not a mathematician.
[99:54.39]I just fucking watch the numbers.
[100:00.80]Is this fighting right now?
[100:04.69]I can't tell if we're fighting.
[100:08.81]That's exactly what I was telling you.
[100:11.55]See?
[100:12.33]We're almost perfect.
[100:13.67]Nobody can get hurt.
[100:14.25]I have 1.8 attack.
[100:18.20]I can't even hurt him.
[100:19.26]Okay?
[100:20.02]He has 4 billion attack, so he can kind of hurt me a little bit.
[100:29.82]Oh, shit.
[100:30.22]I have lots... Wait a minute.
[100:32.52]Okay.
[100:32.98]Um... I got one of these cubes again.
[100:37.04]And this necklace.
[100:38.18]Level 9 accessory.
[100:40.89]Level 14.
[100:41.09]So that's one... Uh... Crappy chest plate.
[100:46.61]Three toughness.
[100:48.09]That's better than this.
[100:50.09]I'm gonna hold on to that, though.
[100:51.01]What about these crappy leggings?
[100:52.66]Three out of three.
[100:54.88]One out of one.
[100:55.36]Alright.
[100:55.94]Um... Maybe I should... Should I keep these?
[100:59.95]What can my cube hold?
[101:01.43]More power?
[101:03.99]I'm at max power now and max health.
[101:05.89]What about toughness?
[101:09.51]Alright, I'm at four to seven.
[101:10.85]What about special?
[101:12.57]I can do this three more times.
[101:13.88]I want the noob cube to be completely upgraded.
[101:17.26]Merge the cube.
[101:19.02]Last time I did that, everybody laughed at me.
[101:20.98]Like I laughed completely out of town here.
[101:23.24]Is that worth it?
[101:39.56]Okay.
[101:40.16]Level 9 chest.
[101:41.82]I think that's good for now.
[101:43.76]20 billion health.
[101:48.63]40 billion.
[101:49.01]I still need more attack.
[101:50.07]Attack 2.
[101:50.91]I'm never going to get there.
[101:54.49]Energy power.
[101:55.15]Let's do this one.
[101:57.17]0.1.
[101:58.91]That was not even worth it, I don't think.
[102:00.31]Wait, it instantly went up.
[102:03.99]Well, that was a mistake.
[102:05.11]Okay.
[102:07.33]Inventories.
[102:09.71]Ooh, four out of... Four power, it's already better.
[102:20.76]And it's level four.
[102:25.62]So I am now able to move on, but I can't because I have to beat the 17th boss here.
[102:29.36]I'm only at boss nine.
[102:32.16]This is boss number nine.
[102:37.03]Why does Jeremy have a bathroom cam?
[102:40.15]Just in case of... I don't know.
[102:41.93]I don't want to get up.
[102:45.13]Fight.
[102:48.73]Wait a minute.
[102:53.48]I can kill it.
[102:56.46]That means I can nuke it, right?
[102:58.90]See you later.
[103:01.44]No.
[103:04.12]I can't.
[103:06.20]No, I have to fight it.
[103:07.24]We have to watch this go down.
[103:16.81]Nuke is only when you can instantly win.
[103:18.55]I see.
[103:21.61]What are you guys linking images for?
[103:23.91]What's on these images?
[103:25.54]It's something that's going to embarrass me.
[103:44.58]No, it's just you traced my face.
[103:46.22]I know exactly what you did here.
[103:48.51]Look.
[103:59.29]Actually, how did you do this?
[104:01.69]Did you just take a screenshot and then trace it?
[104:03.44]I don't even know what the fuck it is.
[104:08.26]Where did it just go?
[104:09.88]Save it.
[104:11.38]Save to desktop.
[104:16.33]It's there, what the fuck?
[104:21.48]I have so much dog shit on my desktop, it's unbelievable.
[104:40.57]Oh fuck no, I didn't mean to do that.
[104:47.36]You're not leaving yet.
[104:56.09]There it is.
[104:56.79]Looks pretty good.
[104:58.93]I look very sad and tired.
[105:02.51]Alright.
[105:03.01]I've seen enough.
[105:05.15]Whoa.
[105:05.64]I won?
[105:06.44]I didn't even get a chance to see my victory.
[105:07.88]That was like an hour and a half in the making.
[105:12.02]God damn it.
[105:12.44]What did I get for that?
[105:14.48]Holy shit.
[105:15.06]Wait a minute.
[105:15.44]Wait a minute.
[105:15.80]Money.
[105:16.74]Experience.
[105:17.34]This guy's got 200 billion HP.
[105:21.47]10 versus 3.
[105:24.89]No, we have to rebirth this one.
[105:26.11]No way I'm doing this shit.
[105:28.59]Uh-uh.
[105:30.63]No.
[105:31.34]Wait.
[105:31.56]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[105:33.84]Money pit.
[105:34.32]Throw it in there.
[105:34.84]Whatever.
[105:36.34]Oh, I can't.
[105:36.76]I have to wait an hour and a half.
[105:37.74]I have to wait two hours to do this.
[105:40.80]Buy energy speed.
[105:41.62]You're killing me.
[105:44.90]I already have been, I got 2.3 energy speed.
[105:48.67]What song is this?
[105:49.29]I feel like I'm going crazy not remembering this.
[105:50.93]This is from Kirby's Air Ride, uh, OST.
[105:55.63]And I don't know what the name of the song is, but it's the full soundtrack.
[106:00.31]Just in the background while we just hang out and fucking play.
[106:05.20]The game that everybody was very happy and excited to play.
[106:09.14]I was.
[106:12.63]Alright, let's do... I got three.
[106:14.43]I'll do it again.
[106:15.15]Fine.
[106:15.87]Energy speed.
[106:18.81]Cool.
[106:20.93]Alright, back to the... This is a 40 minute rebirth time.
[106:27.30]What do you think?
[106:32.70]2,500.
[106:32.72]This is how the number... We have just exponentially increased.
[106:36.56]Let's do it.
[106:44.33]Boom.
[106:48.05]Inventory.
[106:48.85]Let's make... This is a mess.
[106:51.51]Toughness.
[106:52.99]I can still do a few more toughness in here.
[106:54.63]What are my stats at here?
[106:56.61]Plus 15, plus 12.
[106:59.45]Special energy bonus.
[107:02.23]Cracked amulet is at 14.
[107:03.41]I'm going to have to start putting points into these too, aren't I?
[107:05.79]4 to 20.
[107:09.11]4 to 21.
[107:10.68]This stick is just kind of taking up space.
[107:16.29]The mouse is broken.
[107:19.44]What do you mean?
[107:21.64]I guess I'll see it.
[107:23.24]What's my energy cap now?
[107:31.05]Already at 5 million.
[107:33.75]Fight boss.
[107:34.87]It took one second.
[107:38.25]Every time you rebirth, the longer you do it, the more you get exponentially more.
[107:45.41]I can just click it.
[107:47.75]Oh, he killed me.
[107:49.52]Right.
[107:55.72]Oops.
[107:57.64]Alright, that's fine.
[107:58.26]I'm in the millions now.
[108:01.86]Dubai, 4 million, nothing.
[108:04.60]11 million, nothing.
[108:07.74]65 million HP, mouse, you're out.
[108:10.94]Large rat, 325 million HP.
[108:15.58]Let's keep, let's keep that going up.
[108:18.40]28 million.
[108:21.22]Now I know why that person said, get the speed, man.
[108:24.13]That's what I'm, I'm going for it.
[108:25.15]I'll try to get a couple.
[108:27.15]I should do just 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.
[108:34.33]I guess it is the same.
[108:36.67]Drugs are bad.
[108:37.55]Were you implying that I'm on drugs?
[108:39.97]Why are you implying I'm on drugs?
[108:46.70]Alright.
[108:47.16]How much attack?
[108:48.38]Oh.
[108:48.46]See you later.
[108:49.80]What do you got for defense?
[108:51.64]87 million?
[108:52.36]You're dead.
[108:58.18]437 million defense.
[109:01.94]You killed me.
[109:02.46]Alright.
[109:02.76]I'm dead.
[109:04.51]Don't matter.
[109:04.85]I'll just restart.
[109:09.19]Cap that out.
[109:09.79]I want more defense.
[109:11.81]I want 1 billion defense and it's all going into idle attack.
[109:21.06]Adventure zone?
[109:22.15]I will in just a second.
[109:25.03]Alright, almost there.
[109:25.83]Let's see what we got now.
[109:30.29]One billion.
[109:32.71]Your attack... I need your... I need to have a little bit higher defense than this.
[109:38.42]We're already at the wall?
[109:39.42]Fuck, we are already at the wall already.
[109:44.26]Adventure.
[109:44.68]Alright, let's go back to the sewers and just farm.
[109:50.42]Farm money.
[109:54.07]Has it been 30 foot... I'm sucked in.
[109:59.94]Pretty good Beetlejuice song.
[110:01.36]Not bad.
[110:15.92]Play the Beetlejuice OST.
[110:17.06]Nah, I don't think anybody wants to hear that.
[110:22.46]There it is.
[110:22.74]Alright, he's out.
[110:26.14]What was the last thing that I got to?
[110:27.14]It wasn't the goblin.
[110:29.96]This is 40 billion.
[110:32.18]I need some time here.
[110:38.16]Need HP and need attack.
[110:39.54]What's my cap right now?
[110:43.75]Probably 800?
[110:43.97]1,045 energy is what I can have.
[110:53.83]Sounds pretty good to me, what I got to experience.
[110:55.35]2 EXP, energy speed, keep going.
[111:00.85]Money Pit, 47 minutes.
[111:08.16]Don't say it again.
[111:10.28]I already made that joke.
[111:13.22]I think I've done that joke twice.
[111:14.28]Alright, Kirby's Air Ride was pretty cool, but let's do another one.
[111:23.00]How about, um... Do WarioWare?
[111:26.64]That's pretty good.
[111:29.29]I like that one.
[111:33.95]Wario... Wario... WarioWare.
[111:38.95]OST.
[111:39.79]Smooth Moves.
[111:40.65]Yeah, that's the one.
[111:45.24]That's track one.
[111:46.82]Here comes track two.
[111:50.05]I'm not sure why there's a track specifically for him doing the voice line.
[111:53.90]Alright, what do we got?
[111:57.28]12 billion?
[111:57.86]5 billion.
[112:02.32]I think I can do it now.
[112:03.84]Yeah.
[112:05.17]This is the intro.
[112:11.09]This is a classic game.
[112:11.91]Alright, here comes the wall.
[112:18.42]Alright, 20 billion.
[112:23.01]10 billion.
[112:23.87]I can get over that, but I need this to be higher.
[112:25.67]Holy shit.
[112:30.21]I need more.
[112:30.77]This is hurting my eyes looking at this.
[112:32.75]I can't look at this for more than 5 seconds.
[112:35.09]Actually, it hurts my head.
[112:37.67]Oh shit, more of this.
[112:41.91]Helmet.
[112:42.33]Just drag the helmets together and then on top.
[112:46.33]Level 19 head.
[112:51.71]Ring.
[112:52.33]I'm going to keep just combining the rings until they're better.
[112:57.52]I think I'm going to start boosting up.
[112:58.80]Okay, here we go.
[112:59.64]I'm going to do power on the sword.
[113:03.84]Is there a special on the sword?
[113:04.86]There's not.
[113:06.84]Energy speed.
[113:07.56]Oh, there's a special up here.
[113:11.95]2% more energy speed.
[113:15.71]I'm alright with that.
[113:23.13]Alright, 11 billion attack.
[113:26.77]I can now hurt him.
[113:28.27]But he's doing way more to me.
[113:34.69]I think I'm just going to dump every point into one thing.
[113:38.53]Yeah, to do auto-merge, I have to do the unlock.
[113:40.12]There's an unlock I have to actually do.
[113:49.96]It's just something for me to do at this point.
[114:01.38]Money Pit.
[114:02.21]44 minutes.
[114:02.63]That's counting slower.
[114:03.67]That's counting slower now.
[114:10.65]Alright, 11 idle.
[114:11.33]Let's just put it up here.
[114:14.04]16 billion.
[114:14.60]That's going up quick, though.
[114:16.16]You know what?
[114:16.64]No.
[114:17.46]All of it goes in here.
[114:18.64]Put every single thing in here.
[114:19.70]I want to see this number jump.
[114:22.56]There we go.
[114:24.70]Alright.
[114:26.20]I'm almost going to be doing double what you have in defense.
[114:33.72]You lied about hot lava.
[114:36.08]Not necessarily.
[114:37.22]I got addicted to this game.
[114:46.41]He just put on this OST.
[114:47.78]Give it some time.
[114:49.24]Yeah, I just put it on.
[114:53.22]WarioWare for the Wii had a great soundtrack.
[114:56.98]So, yeah, this will be on for a little while.
[114:58.54]That's fine.
[115:01.35]Alright.
[115:03.01]Almost going to be two times, three times what he has.
[115:12.09]I haven't had a single clue what's going on this whole time.
[115:15.65]Let me fill you in.
[115:19.03]Up here, you have a bar that is constantly producing energy.
[115:24.53]When you get energy, you can use your energy.
[115:28.69]It's one point.
[115:29.81]See?
[115:30.45]Over here.
[115:31.55]One point will generate... I don't know how it works either.
[115:37.88]It generates...
[115:39.19]of level one point of energy it makes a level which increases this bar to increase how your HP and your attack and so now I'm using I have 1045 energy I'm using all of it right now to do like to supercharge this and now that I've done five thousand of these I can do this now which is just a better idea because this gives you more
[116:09.65]Points per energy level.
[116:13.59]And then once you get to a certain... I have a thousand points in here.
[116:18.73]This is the defense section.
[116:20.23]So right now I don't have any.
[116:23.44]I don't have any... The mouse is out of sync.
[116:27.88]That is weird.
[116:29.10]Why is that happening?
[116:32.36]Okay, right now my mouse is down in the lower right hand side of the screen.
[116:39.93]That's weird.
[116:40.37]I don't know why it's doing that.
[116:48.56]Gemma, help.
[116:48.96]My dog is... It'll be alright.
[116:52.06]Alright, so... Just in the time that we've been talking.
[116:56.42]Just in the time that we've been hanging out here.
[116:59.11]I've gotten 37 billion... This is the one.
[117:05.34]So then you take what you have done, you take the upgrades that you've done to your counting mechanism, and you go over to the fighting screen, and then you, I've built up enough attack and HP where I now am stronger than this orc.
[117:21.68]And then you hit the fight button, and as you see, hold on, let me explain it better.
[117:25.62]I have 40 attack, he has 10 defense.
[117:31.25]Therefore, I'm doing 30 attack to this orc per quadrosecond.
[117:36.95]That's how it works.
[117:37.95]I have 7 defense, and he has 20 offense.
[117:42.47]I am taking 14 worth of points per quadrosecond of damage.
[117:47.06]That's how it works.
[117:49.06]So I'm trying to kill him faster than he can kill me.
[117:50.78]He can still kill me faster.
[117:51.92]I'm going to hold on to my points.
[117:57.64]My inventory is getting... Okay, I can...
[118:09.22]The music's fucking me up because I feel like I want to press start.
[118:11.46]I feel like I'm just pressed start already.
[118:14.50]Move on to the next menu.
[118:17.44]Toughness is... By the way, if you combine items, for instance, these chest plates.
[118:25.87]They... Do you see the number here?
[118:31.43]When you combine these, for instance, if I drag this over here, this smelly chest, whatever it's called, it splattered with some smelly, yes.
[118:40.60]So you can combine them, I just did, and now this makes it a little bit better.
[118:43.96]Yeah, why is this doing that?
[118:51.43]I'm so confused.
[118:52.07]Alright, I need power.
[119:02.32]Toughness.
[119:03.14]Yeah, I can do one more.
[119:03.92]Because I just upgraded the cube.
[119:07.79]That's it.
[119:08.15]This is maxed out.
[119:09.45]Time to move on to other products.
[119:11.97]Let's put it in here.
[119:14.03]Put the hat in.
[119:15.59]Power up the sword.
[119:16.23]Alright, that's all.
[119:18.62]Adventure.
[119:18.98]That's all I can do.
[119:20.96]I need to get to boss 17.
[119:21.82]Go.
[119:21.94]Go.
[119:28.62]Got it.
[119:30.14]Got it.
[119:32.34]Alright, now I need to do this.
[119:36.77]I need way... I need to cap this out.
[119:38.51]We need more of this.
[119:41.47]Beat boss 10.
[119:45.00]This is pushing your way through.
[119:45.96]You encounter a small clearing in the forest.
[119:47.30]Try to dash through, but barely make it halfway before rotting corpses begin clawing their way out of the Earth.
[119:52.12]One weak, shuffling zombie inches towards you.
[119:54.96]Might as well have some fun.
[119:56.56]Okay.
[119:57.24]He's got a hundred billion attack.
[120:00.79]This one ain't gonna go so well.
[120:02.67]Money Pit, 38 minutes.
[120:03.75]This is counting slow.
[120:09.97]Adventure, I need to get to 17.
[120:14.56]That ain't gonna fucking happen.
[120:17.06]It's been a week.
[120:19.32]Wake up, it's been a week.
[120:24.63]I gotta refill that.
[120:25.91]I want another coffee.
[120:26.55]I'm trying to Google this game.
[120:34.23]I'm trying to Google this name.
[120:38.00]It's on Steam.
[120:39.68]It's NGU idle.

[121:23.49]Almost there.
[121:24.19]I can almost hurt this guy.
[121:26.27]My defense needs to be much better.
[121:27.63]I have 6 points.
[121:30.62]Alright.
[121:36.64]Why have I not been saving for this?
[121:40.66]Plus 10,000!
[121:40.94]10,000?!
[121:40.96]I thought it was 10!
[121:51.14]Oh my goodness.
[121:54.71]That opens up everything.
[121:55.95]That makes it... Oh my god.
[121:58.55]Alright.
[121:59.45]But it's too hard.
[122:00.27]Okay, 6.
[122:06.45]I need to get that higher.
[122:08.15]50 billion attack.
[122:13.41]Almost at... What do you got for defense?
[122:18.65]It needs to be higher.
[122:19.32]It needs to be much higher.
[122:23.21]Alright.
[122:24.43]Pull this back.
[122:26.19]We're gonna do 50-50 split here.
[122:27.53]I got 1000.
[122:28.29]We're gonna do 1000.
[122:31.11]500, 500, 45.
[122:31.63]Let it work.
[122:33.75]Well, I do a Fortnite dance too.
[122:35.01]Mario, where's OST?
[122:38.09]Just kidding.
[122:40.87]What happened to the lava game?
[122:42.17]It's still available.
[122:46.35]What did the dev say?
[122:52.20]You can't buy the energy cap upgrades until you max out energy from rebirthing.
[122:56.74]Oh, shit.
[123:06.41]I like that.
[123:06.85]Stop this.
[123:13.89]I have to fill this before I lose my mind.
[123:17.88]You know the toothpick, that whole joke with the convention?
[123:21.11]The reason why that existed, guys, is because if I don't have something in my hands, or in my mouth, or something to hold, I go nuts.
[123:33.11]It, like, it, like, pacifies me.
[123:36.79]Otherwise, I'd be like... I need it.
[123:50.65]You're having a fidget.
[123:51.63]Helps me too.
[123:52.15]I fidget a lot.
[123:52.73]That's why I'm like, I'm... You know what it is?
[124:00.53]I have like NPC coded random actions that I just pull out for no reason.
[124:07.82]You know when you go up to an NPC in like GTA and they're drinking out of a cup and it's empty and you're like, oh my god.
[124:12.08]What the fuck is that guy doing?
[124:15.36]You are watching somebody do that right now.
[124:20.07]This has been empty for an hour.
[124:28.89]I've got like a GTA pedestrian wired brain up here.
[124:33.94]Go get a refill?
[124:34.64]I can't right now.
[124:35.40]I'm too busy.
[124:35.86]Alright, let's do some power, huh?
[124:39.16]No, in the sword.
[124:42.18]I'm getting powerful this way.
[124:44.53]Toughness, you got it.
[124:50.97]What do I got?
[124:55.03]Alright, uh, Money Pit.
[124:56.39]33 minutes.
[125:00.56]I think it's ready.
[125:01.00]What do I got?
[125:05.28]60 to 54.
[125:05.58]42 to 100.
[125:05.78]Not quite.
[125:07.54]Max HP, too much.
[125:09.78]No, I can't.
[125:11.03]I can't do it.
[125:11.51]8 experience.
[125:18.31]I'm gonna do energy power.
[125:19.89]I need 15, because that just makes everything better.
[125:21.81]I can do another rebirth coming up.
[125:36.90]What do I need?
[125:39.00]I need defense.
[125:39.70]I have enough attack to kill it.
[125:42.16]Training.
[125:42.90]Pull out of this.
[125:43.88]Put it all in defense.
[125:44.88]I just need more defense.
[125:45.92]Way more.
[125:51.20]745, 300.
[125:51.44]Sounds good.
[125:58.91]What's the name of the game?
[126:34.00]I keep winning in Wario Kart and it's freaking me out.
[126:39.42]What color should I do?
[126:43.04]Just put it in the title.
[126:48.80]The title of the stream is Numbers Go Up.
[127:13.35]He's fuming.
[127:14.21]What does the stream name stand for?
[127:34.29]I don't know.
[127:36.45]Fight boss.
[127:36.99]Alright, here we go.
[127:37.69]Alright.
[127:39.23]Why are you wearing a sick butt?
[127:44.01]This OST has a lot of tracks that are sort of just... You completed a minigame and we're going to load a whole new soundtrack for it.
[127:53.93]Unreal Tournament OST.
[127:55.11]No, that's too intense for me right now.
[127:57.13]Alright, 60 billion defense.
[127:58.93]We're almost ready.
[128:06.42]Katamari?
[128:07.32]Everybody loves Katamari.
[128:08.72]It always pops up during one of these streams.
[128:13.03]How you guys doing today?
[128:13.75]You guys doing good?
[128:18.39]How are things?
[128:19.43]Things going good?
[128:21.12]No?
[128:21.48]Yeah?
[128:22.06]Yeah?
[128:24.78]Uh, Katamari OST.
[128:29.28]This is Katamari Forever OST.
[128:31.28]I mean, they're all good.
[128:35.13]Kind of just pick whatever one you want.
[128:40.49]A little louder.
[128:44.04]This is the wrong one.
[128:44.74]This is the wrong one.
[128:51.02]Alright, I need to do training here.
[128:52.54]We've got defenses.
[128:54.48]Good.
[128:55.92]It's time to only put it in the super strength one.
[129:02.21]And I'm looking for enough attack.
[129:04.25]I'm looking for about 100.
[129:05.65]Because if I get 100 billion attack, that
[129:11.13]I can kill it.
[129:12.69]And then we can rebirth.
[129:20.27]I might just rebirth now.
[129:22.10]10 experience.
[129:22.72]Let's do... Oh, what a mess.
[129:30.96]Okay, this... Orange is power.

[130:20.65]Cube into the cube.
[130:21.53]Yeah.
[130:30.53]This is a new thing.
[130:31.15]We unlock it.
[130:37.70]Rake in the lake.
[130:43.02]I need more... What's Rebirth going to look like here?
[130:47.66]That's another huge increase.
[130:52.65]I love that there's a time factor as well to make sure you don't just spam it over and over again.
[130:59.35]I'm going to wait until this gets to like 25,000.
[131:04.60]I think that's a good idea.
[131:06.28]If I were to say.
[131:10.54]Exponential increasing.
[131:15.19]I should rebirth, that number is huge.
[131:17.79]Oh yeah, I wanna kill this guy first.
[131:21.18]I'm so close to being able to take this guy out.
[131:24.02]In fact, I might be able to do it now.
[131:27.56]80 to 50, 60 to 100, it's gonna be close.
[131:29.20]He's winning.
[131:29.98]Stop.
[131:30.72]Stop!
[131:31.38]Stop.
[131:35.77]Not playing on sadistic.
[131:43.20]What a great game.
[131:51.62]I should play this.
[131:52.18]I already did.
[131:52.90]I should play all of them.
[131:54.42]Didn't I play two of them?
[131:56.70]I did.
[131:58.36]I should play the other ones.
[132:00.62]I'll do that next week.
[132:01.72]I'll play the other ones.
[132:04.38]I'm gonna play like two or three or something.
[132:05.87]I'll do it next week.
[132:07.83]These games are phenomenal.
[132:09.65]Um...
[132:14.67]Played rerolled?
[132:15.29]Yeah, I did rerolled a few months ago actually, right?
[132:18.66]Alright, this is it.
[132:19.30]Here we go.
[132:22.30]Come on, this is why we were sitting here for so long.
[132:24.80]Bring him down.
[132:25.52]Six.
[132:26.22]Six.
[132:27.23]Five.
[132:28.77]Five.
[132:29.41]Come on, do it.
[132:30.67]Four.
[132:31.13]Bring him down to four.
[132:33.79]And then I rebirth.
[132:35.63]It's gonna do it.
[132:36.37]It's gonna do it.
[132:37.03]It's gonna do it.
[132:37.65]I'm almost ahead of him.
[132:45.50]Stick with it.
[132:48.21]Yes.
[132:50.99]Got it.
[132:54.79]Oh, and look at that rebirth.
[132:56.59]I wanted 25,000.
[132:57.91]We beat that boss.
[132:59.65]Sword.
[133:00.63]Sword up to 40k.
[133:01.33]Look at that.
[133:02.23]This guy said 5 trillion health.
[133:19.85]Wait, I can do toughness and... Yeah, I can do it all.
[133:23.71]Just make that cube insane.
[133:27.67]This is boss 12.
[133:32.61]I'm... But look at all these points.
[133:34.13]Am I streaming tomorrow?
[133:44.42]Yeah, I'm streaming tomorrow.
[133:46.64]I was thinking about doing the community event tomorrow.
[133:50.15]Thinking about it.
[133:50.63]I was gonna, after the stream today, I was gonna go in and pull stuff out and see if there's enough there.
[133:57.25]If there's not enough for the community night tomorrow, then we're gonna play just, we'll play something else.
[134:05.64]What's the gold for?
[134:07.22]For right now, it's to throw into a hole.
[134:11.02]Maybe eventually I unlock something that's not just a money pit.
[134:15.34]I don't know.
[134:25.79]No, I'm not playing this tomorrow.
[134:30.56]I just wanted to check this out.
[134:32.48]Because I like watching numbers go up.
[134:36.34]I'm not going to play this tomorrow.
[134:39.13]This is not going to be the thing that I do for the next six days.
[134:44.11]Just leave it on overnight.
[134:51.60]I still want to play Hot Lava.
[134:57.50]After I rebirth like two or three more times, we're going to play Hot Lava.
[135:00.42]And I'm going to leave this on in the background.
[135:12.69]42,000.
[135:13.57]It's going up so fast.
[135:18.55]You're the number one idle gamer on Twitch.
[135:22.70]I don't really want to be that person.
[135:26.16]I don't want to be that.
[135:26.98]It's like one day, I'm just playing this idle game.
[135:36.16]It's just chatting with some extra steps.
[135:41.15]And music.
[135:44.69]Wait for 30 minutes.
[135:47.63]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[135:49.33]I'm gonna go refill.
[135:51.27]I'm gonna go refill.
[135:54.35]I'm just leaving it on.
[135:55.33]Like, there's no reason... Why do I need to go to the BRB screen?
[135:58.89]I'm gonna fill this up.
[136:05.80]I'm not gonna pause this.
[136:08.96]Now you guys are idling, yeah.
[136:12.68]He's never gonna play... I'm going to play Hot Lava before the stream ends tonight.
[136:18.59]I've only been streaming for like two and a half hours.
[136:20.01]I've got plenty of time, don't worry.
[136:24.09]Alright, I'll be right back.
[136:24.65]I'm going to refill.
[136:26.15]Just enjoy the music and enjoy the number going up for a little while.
[136:30.27]Wait, hold on, before I leave.
[136:32.59]I need to do this first.
[136:37.66]Rebirth.
[136:38.00]44,000.
[136:38.02]30 minutes.
[136:38.28]Let's see what happens.
[136:39.62]As we get that time increase.
[136:41.00]Alright.
[136:59.66]1,283 energy.
[137:04.86]How much experience?
[137:05.54]13, I'm gonna wait for this.
[137:08.52]Basic training.
[137:11.89]Let's just get, cap that out.
[137:13.87]Attack, let's see, holy shit, look at each point.
[137:17.65]Each level is like 50 million, 40 million attack?
[137:24.51]Wow.
[137:27.23]Wow.
[137:29.92]Alright, see you in like fucking five minutes.
[137:32.76]No, I'll be back in like two minutes.
[137:34.08]I'm just gonna get a refill.
[137:36.51]And then we're gonna play Hot Lava.
[137:38.01]I don't wanna do that.
[137:38.75]You gotta check games out, man.
[137:42.14]I'm just checking it out.
[137:43.94]I'm just checking it out.
[137:57.90]Let me do one more thing, though.
[137:58.98]Hold on.
[137:59.38]One more thing.
[137:59.74]Before I leave.
[138:05.08]I gotta split this up.
[138:11.91]I gotta wait till it's like 150, 150.
[138:12.63]Okay.
[138:40.00]Alright, I bet.
[139:46.62]Thank you.
[140:18.41]I want to do something new I've never seen, never heard I'm a challenger
[140:46.28]What did I miss?
[140:46.64]What happened?
[140:47.00]What happened?
[140:47.30]What happened?
[140:47.66]What did I miss?
[140:48.70]Did I go up?
[140:49.68]Did I go up or down?
[140:50.94]How many points do I have?
[140:52.10]71 billion?
[140:53.70]Did I miss anything?
[140:59.25]Perfect 75, 75.
[140:59.75]This is perfect.
[141:03.99]Money came out of the screen.
[141:05.10]I missed the fucking money?! !
[141:11.27]I hate that.
[141:12.07]I hate when you miss, like, the click on the screen for the free money.
[141:15.13]They used to do that shit.
[141:15.85]Do you guys remember that?
[141:18.81]How many of you guys remember the old 1999-2000 year pop-up windows that tried to get you to claim checks that didn't exist?
[141:31.66]Click here!
[141:32.10]You have unclaimed money!
[141:34.88]Unclaimed money?
[141:35.92]Really?
[141:36.43]And you'd click it.
[141:38.39]And they would just fucking steal all your identity.
[141:44.03]Remember the pop-ups would just launch at the screen?
[141:48.91]There was no pop-up blockers.
[141:50.97]There was no ad block.
[141:53.07]You got bombarded.
[141:54.11]You would have a window open here, right in front of you.
[141:57.52]And then behind that window, after one session of browsing, there would be 40 to 50 other windows that you didn't know were open.
[142:09.06]And yes, somebody just said it.
[142:10.87]A bunch of them were porn ads.
[142:14.03]Just no shame at all.
[142:15.73]Just porn.
[142:17.03]They would just have open.
[142:18.93]Can you imagine browsing fucking the internet?
[142:22.65]It'd be mail-in rebate, mail-in rebate, mail-in rebate.
[142:26.98]Claim your check.
[142:27.94]Claim your money.
[142:28.80]You have free money.
[142:30.00]Money, money, money.
[142:31.00]Porn, porn, porn.
[142:32.54]Porn.
[142:33.48]Naked person on the screen.
[142:34.67]Two naked people on the screen.
[142:35.79]Holy shit.
[142:37.29]How did anybody even browse back then?
[142:38.73]I don't even remember.
[142:43.25]I don't have a memory of... I think it was just like normal.
[142:47.03]And you sat there going like this at the end of your browsing session.
[142:52.27]xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx And they'd play sound too.
[142:57.11]So it would be like... They were fucking horrible.
[143:00.49]What do I got?
[143:01.13]145 billion, let's do it.
[143:14.13]Should I just nuke?
[143:15.59]No, I don't want to- I don't like nuke.
[143:16.69]I like being able to see my progress.
[143:22.20]Goblin.
[143:23.24]Instantly.
[143:23.92]Orc.
[143:24.66]Done.
[143:26.32]Slow zombie.
[143:27.12]I'm a- Remember how long and painful this was?
[143:32.42]Oh, fuck, I have a ton of idle energy.
[143:41.15]There we go.
[143:47.49]Computers were just RuneScape machines.
[143:51.21]RuneScape machines.
[143:53.19]Faster.
[143:53.63]I'm trying to go faster.
[144:01.40]No, here's the wall.
[144:02.34]Okay.
[144:03.14]Experience.
[144:03.68]19.
[144:03.70]We're gonna do energy power here.
[144:06.16]Take a look over here.
[144:07.42]We got 237 billion.
[144:10.02]Proves the effectiveness of your allocated energy.
[144:12.98]This means faster progress on features while using less energy.
[144:20.11]Energy cap.
[144:21.59]I don't have... I think I have to hit... Once you have 100,000 max energy.
[144:27.81]I can't do it?
[144:28.23]Yep.
[144:28.37]Yeah, I can't do it yet.
[144:33.70]I need 100,000.
[144:33.92]Yeah, I can't do it.
[144:39.52]Play the Deadly Premonition OST.
[144:47.86]Didn't I play Deadly Premonition for like an hour?
[144:57.77]That freaks me out for a second.
[145:01.09]Basic energy cap.
[145:04.40]So should I just wait?
[145:05.24]I'm just gonna wait.
[145:07.14]Can I kill you yet?
[145:08.22]Almost.
[145:08.60]What do we got?
[145:10.44]Basic training.
[145:11.66]More.
[145:12.42]In fact, no, no, no, no.
[145:14.10]Get it all in here.
[145:16.28]All 1200 just until this gets to 5k.
[145:26.07]You didn't think this was gonna be the most fucking upbeat stream you've seen in a week.
[145:40.18]We're just bopping.
[145:50.09]What a cool streamer.
[145:53.95]I know the joke is if this is your first stream of mine, then you're gonna be like... Every stream.
[146:01.83]We just... I don't know.
[146:03.65]And you'll be fine.
[146:07.68]Hi, this is my first stream.
[146:09.06]What's up?
[146:10.20]Welcome to the channel!
[146:15.86]I was voted... Fourth most energetic...
[146:23.05]Twitch streamer with under 500,000 followers.
[146:27.73]Why did you win that?
[146:31.56]Because I did.
[146:34.12]It's a pity award.
[146:54.34]It's not a pity award.
[146:56.78]It's an award.
[147:04.19]Weird flex, but okay.
[147:07.45]No, the weird part about that weird flex is it's a fake weird flex.
[147:13.53]Yeah, I was voted 16th most energetic streamer on Twitch with followers between 251,000 and 251,014.
[147:20.78]I was voted number 14 on that list.
[147:23.12]Pretty good, if you ask me.
[147:23.94]What?
[147:24.04]Why am I lying?
[147:40.18]I have a very important question for everybody watching right now.
[147:44.00]Important.
[147:45.68]When does a lie become a lie?
[147:49.06]Because if you say something that's not true and immediately it's corrected, is that a lie?
[147:56.72]I think a lie has to sit as if it were fact for at least one day.
[148:04.29]I think that's not a lie because I'm not trying to push it off as real.
[148:09.38]What is it, 15 minutes?
[148:12.43]If I tell you that, hey, I won an award at TwitchCon for top 40 funny faces, and I didn't correct it, and like four days went by, that's a lie.
[148:25.38]But if I told you, I bet you, no, that's a bet.
[148:28.98]If I told you that I won that award, and then 10 seconds later I said, that's not real, it's a fucking joke.
[148:36.26]When is a lie a joke, and when is a joke a lie?
[148:39.99]No, a lie has to sit for 24 hours before it's a lie.
[148:43.61]I will stand by that.
[148:52.78]Untruth.
[148:56.46]Wait, hold on, I'm facing an Ent.
[148:58.72]You haul ass and make it past the clearing, managing to shake off most of those fast-charging type zombies.
[149:04.24]After putting some more distance between you and them, you take a breather against a tree until it starts moving under you.
[149:08.85]God damn it.
[149:13.23]Yeah, I only lie for 23 hours at a time.
[149:16.39]I'm trying to think of... Have I ever told you guys, like, a true lie?
[149:22.26]Like, a real one?
[149:25.24]One that sat for 24 hours.
[149:27.48]That was me lying to you about something.
[149:32.45]You lied about Sam & Max.
[149:33.69]I didn't lie about Sam & Max.
[149:34.87]I played Season 3 and didn't like it.
[149:40.63]I played something and didn't like it.
[149:42.19]That's a lie.
[149:45.14]You lied about Ace Attorney.
[149:46.24]Now I told you that I played Ace Attorney for a little bit off stream and I didn't think it was going to be a game I wanted to stream.
[149:51.04]That's not a lie.
[149:51.64]That's me coming to a conclusion.
[149:53.90]And I told you that.
[149:56.32]You lied about Wailord.
[149:59.91]What'd you say?
[150:01.71]What did you say?
[150:02.19]I heard you.
[150:02.85]What are you saying?
[150:05.45]I still haven't watched that, by the way.
[150:10.27]You took more than 24 hours to correct it.
[150:13.57]Wait, I gotta do stuff.
[150:15.65]Oh, fuck.
[150:20.13]I didn't take more than 24 hours to correct that.
[150:24.72]Wait, this is power.
[150:25.50]Max power.
[150:29.49]I'm gonna go over my inventory here.
[150:33.31]And see what's better.
[150:34.23]Okay, three.
[150:35.57]This is good.
[150:36.83]Three.
[150:37.59]This accessory is not going anywhere.
[150:38.95]It's the noob cube.
[150:39.63]I'm not taking it off.
[150:42.92]Money.
[150:44.18]Eight medicine.
[150:44.74]Where's my gold?
[150:47.80]Oh, fuck.
[150:48.24]It's because I reset.
[150:49.02]Alright, hold on.
[150:51.68]Training here.
[150:52.20]I need to do this.
[150:53.62]Hold this out.
[150:54.02]We gotta get this 5,000 as fast as possible.
[150:58.22]You lied about Monster Rancher 4.
[151:01.80]Did I though?
[151:03.56]Did I lie about Monster Rancher 4?
[151:08.04]Somebody just gave five community subs thanks to whoever did that.
[151:11.12]That was anonymous.
[151:12.64]Thanks to the five community subs.
[151:17.38]Just anonymous.
[151:19.33]Thanks a lot whoever you are.
[151:23.71]You lied about the definition of lying.
[151:28.01]What are you guys on about?
[151:34.97]What an incredible soundtrack to this video game.
[151:40.87]I wanted to stop playing this game.
[151:46.01]An hour ago.
[151:47.49]And move on to Hot Lava.
[151:48.77]But I can't.
[151:49.91]Because I have to see.
[151:50.71]I need to know.
[151:54.41]We'll do a long one tonight.
[151:59.77]How is that a lie?
[152:03.47]No, a lie is not a lie until it is something that you specifically are trying to push forward as a truth that sits in everybody's bellies for 24 hours.
[152:16.97]What's this game called?
[152:18.98]It's called... Look it up, it's on Steam.
[152:29.70]It's a lie, it's only a lie if you believe it.
[152:34.04]What?
[152:35.28]No, a lie... A lie is something that, a statement that you are making to try to push forward as a real thing or a truth that you want people to think is real that sits in their bellies for 24 hours and you continue to try to push the fact that it is real when it never was in the first place.
[152:58.60]Now, I make mistakes.
[153:00.66]Okay?
[153:01.46]Ace Attorney, me saying I was going to play Ace Attorney was a mistake.
[153:05.10]That's not a lie.
[153:05.82]It's a mistake.
[153:07.30]I make mistakes.
[153:08.84]I don't lie.
[153:09.38]Alright, I'm almost there.
[153:22.09]I just want to play Hot Lava, but I fucking can't.
[153:23.99]I cannot.
[153:24.45]I can't do it.
[153:27.05]That means I have to hit the X here, but my body won't do it.
[153:36.61]25 trillion.
[153:38.28]Defense.
[153:39.16]Alright, getting there.
[153:40.30]What do I got for rebirth here?
[153:43.94]150,000.
[153:44.12]I need 15 more minutes and that doubles.
[153:49.66]Switch monitors.
[153:50.26]I can't do that.
[153:52.56]No, I can't do that.
[153:53.38]No, I cannot.
[153:57.12]I can't.
[153:58.92]Watch the video of lies compiled.
[154:00.96]Nobody's made it.
[154:02.02]I said to make that a long time ago and nobody made it.
[154:05.84]I was like, if you want to call me out, I want a Jerma has lied video.
[154:10.30]And a compilation of everything I've ever said that was a lie.
[154:12.54]I made that challenge and... What do you know?
[154:19.60]I haven't seen it yet.
[154:23.45]There are too many.
[154:25.15]It's still uploading.
[154:26.67]It's very long.
[154:27.83]Okay.
[154:41.26]What even is this game?
[154:50.20]It's an ever-growing video.
[154:54.96]Did you ever do that Stardew Co-op stream?
[154:58.02]No, because Stardew... Alright, I have to play.
[155:02.89]I have to focus and get busy.
[155:05.71]22 experience.
[155:06.43]Almost getting close to 40.
[155:07.77]Go to my inventory.
[155:10.31]I'm not even on an adventure.
[155:13.52]Hurry the... up.
[155:20.33]Wait.
[155:20.55]I'm gonna say two.
[155:23.11]Two versus 1.3.
[155:25.11]Two versus... I need more defense.
[155:26.33]Let's get it up.
[155:27.89]Boys and girls, I need defense.
[155:30.21]Get it up.
[155:31.61]Come on.
[155:32.97]I need 10,000 in this to this.
[155:34.97]Never gonna happen.
[155:36.65]Changing the subject.
[155:38.55]What do you mean?
[155:42.36]Make sure to unlock Popping Gamer.
[155:46.96]I already was gotten by that one, so you're not gonna get me again.
[155:54.25]What track is this?
[155:55.89]I don't know.
[155:57.49]It's the whole two and a half hour long OST.
[156:02.17]You lied about peaking your mic.
[156:05.89]I peaked my mic yesterday by screaming about a flashbang.
[156:12.91]Is it actually sick music?
[156:13.93]Yes, it is.
[156:20.33]Two minutes until I can throw money in there.
[156:21.75]Alright, I'm going for it.
[156:33.43]Not gonna be fast enough, but I need it.
[156:37.77]No, it's not gonna happen.
[156:38.65]Stop.
[156:43.05]I need a little more attack.
[156:52.01]Alright, enough.
[156:52.55]A little more attack.
[156:56.15]Cap it.
[156:56.55]Let's go.
[157:00.32]Just enough to give myself the edge here.
[157:04.68]You said two or three more Rebirths before the Lava game.
[157:07.04]I did one.
[157:08.36]Upcoming here is two.
[157:09.96]And then after that will be three.
[157:18.91]Bingo.
[157:20.23]What do we got?
[157:23.25]179,000.
[157:23.41]Oh, and in ten minutes that's doubles!
[157:28.56]Double!
[157:33.88]Where's it going to be at?
[157:36.08]181.
[157:37.10]Boom.
[157:37.70]See you later.
[157:39.74]Giant.
[157:41.43]Entering this forest is feeling more and more like a bad idea.
[157:43.73]Even the air is starting to taste sort of odd.
[157:45.65]Like copper and iron.
[157:48.33]You strain to keep an eye on the forest path with the haze thickening around you.
[157:51.51]You manage to keep on the path, but somehow also manage to bump right into a giant in front of you.
[157:55.56]Enjoy the fight.
[157:59.94]Who's Bob?
[158:04.18]I think he's got 12 trillion attack.
[158:06.55]That ain't gonna work out.
[158:07.45]375,000.
[158:08.23]We just gotta last another 10 minutes.
[158:09.41]You haven't waited 24 hours yet.
[158:10.95]You haven't waited, because in like an hour, that's not gonna be a lie.
[158:27.64]Oh, this is hot.
[158:38.85]I like this one.
[158:39.55]This is a hot track.
[158:55.52]Little did you guys think.
[158:58.09]That fucking idle number counting stream is gonna be the most lit stream you've been at all day.
[159:05.55]It's not a lie, it hasn't been 24 hours yet.
[159:13.84]You could go to like a music stream in about 45 minutes and it's not a lie.
[159:23.06]Please don't say lit.
[159:29.78]Say whatever I want.
[159:34.96]Lit is as bad as epic.
[159:43.33]No, epic is a whole nother tier.
[159:47.57]I think you can still say lit ironically as a joke and it's okay.
[159:51.75]Epic is like completely out of bounds now.
[160:03.18]Epic is in a category on its own.
[160:04.64]Alright, one more rebirth and I'm gonna play Hot Lava.
[160:14.36]And I'm gonna keep this running in the background.
[160:15.88]And we're gonna check in on it every now and then.
[160:21.85]Seven and a half minutes countdown until Flora's Lava.
[160:28.50]Chat complaining about youth culture.
[160:30.00]You guys are the real boomers.
[160:31.78]You guys are youth culture.
[160:35.76]I can see it in my analytics.
[160:38.42]You guys are youth culture.
[160:39.72]This is you.
[160:41.62]Not me anymore.
[160:42.28]I bet you still have Cookie Clicker running.
[160:52.81]I'm out of that category now.
[160:54.75]As of my 34th birthday.
[161:01.71]Everyone here is in their 30s, what are you talking about?
[161:06.91]I would assume there's probably a few 30 year olds here.
[161:11.75]How many people are here?
[161:13.75]Like 4400?
[161:14.23]4400 people?
[161:16.48]Maybe 2500 30 year olds?
[161:21.96]Alright, 6 minutes until I can rebirth and this is getting minimized and we're opening hot lava.
[161:27.46]And I can stop getting just the outpour of fucking hate mail that's coming in through my PO box over here.
[161:33.40]A stack this high of letters.
[161:38.53]Telling me to change game.
[161:41.47]They just keep coming in.
[161:49.78]Using letters.
[161:58.75]Do not stop playing this game.
[161:59.77]I'm not going to stop playing this game.
[162:04.76]Just because I'm moving on to another game doesn't mean that this game stops.
[162:09.30]Because I've got news for you.
[162:12.76]Once I'm done playing... You don't speak during this track, by the way.
[162:56.32]I forget what I was going to say.
[162:57.10]I don't remember what it was.
[162:59.00]It was something important.
[163:01.02]Oh, yeah, the game's going to be playing in the background while we play Hot Lava.
[163:04.13]And then everyone that wants to see a different game today will do that.
[163:09.96]And then we're coming back to this.
[163:11.82]This game ain't getting closed.
[163:15.35]Still can't even fight this guy.
[163:16.75]What do we got?
[163:17.47]Rebirth.
[163:17.89]We have four minutes.
[163:19.77]We're going to hit a million.
[163:22.15]One million.
[163:22.89]One million.
[163:23.57]One million.
[163:25.83]Money pit.
[163:27.07]Not yet.
[163:29.81]After I kill the giant.
[163:31.19]No.
[163:36.29]Mm-mm.
[163:36.77]Mm-mm-mm-mm.
[163:42.42]This is a Bitcoin mining scam.
[163:50.98]This is a idle game that has a very passionate developer who has made tons of content in here.
[164:06.35]How dare you say something that much of a lie.
[164:13.97]In 23 hours and 59 minutes, I demand an apology.
[164:20.13]Here comes a call-out post.
[164:34.18]I'm never gonna be able to do this.
[164:35.46]Hold on, here it comes.
[164:37.20]And then after this, I just want to see what a million number points looks like.
[164:42.70]Why am I holding this?
[164:48.12]Have I shown you the book of our Lord?
[164:51.26]Sir, if you have just one moment!
[165:04.21]Two minutes.
[165:08.52]Two minutes until we can play another game.
[165:11.64]Read the fucking book.
[165:13.04]This webcam is mirrored.
[165:26.47]Yeah, because if I wasn't mirrored, I'd be looking over this way.
[165:29.15]No, I have to point the wrong way.
[165:30.47]So I have to point this way because it's mirrored.
[165:32.53]I'd be looking this way and I'd be looking at the video game screen with my board game.
[165:38.31]Look at all these things to unlock.
[165:42.46]right I'm gonna take a look power one two three money pit not yet here we go this is gonna be it one minute
[166:28.76]He's stalling.
[166:30.38]There's a countdown on the screen!
[166:32.38]It's not a stall!
[166:34.18]I have to burn 30 seconds here!
[166:39.14]The game is a stall!
[166:42.05]Alright, okay, now I see what you're doing with this one.
[166:45.47]Alright.
[166:45.89]Ooh!
[166:51.03]One million, coming up.
[166:53.23]One... fucking million.
[166:55.95]Biggest number you've ever seen, that I've ever seen in my whole life.
[167:05.56]Okay, now I just wanna, I just wanna know what it looks like.
[167:12.13]Somebody right now is in their chair just going like, GET OUT OF THIS FUCKING GAME!
[167:17.56]And I'm just sitting there going, hey, I like this one.
[167:26.10]So you're like strapped to the chair.
[167:27.74]Get me out of this chair.
[167:31.58]There's a tape and... God.
[167:36.53]Why do you look like Leon from Resident Evil?
[167:38.19]Because I was the fucking face map for that game.
[167:45.90]From now.
[167:46.32]Alright.
[167:47.14]But we... I don't want to turn the music.
[167:50.53]This music is... I don't want to...
[168:01.62]I don't want to turn the music off.
[168:03.00]We can't.
[168:03.27]Wait until the whole OST is done.
[168:04.79]In two hours.
[168:07.51]Wait until the OST is done in two hours.
[168:09.79]And we'll play Hot Lava.
[168:10.99]That's a good enough... That's a good compromise, I think.
[168:13.67]It's all about compromise.
[168:18.59]Kidding.
[168:22.25]But we do have to turn the music off.
[168:24.58]Hold on.
[168:25.32]Important.
[168:26.87]Let me clean this up first, and then I'm going to let it run in the background while I jump from device to device and try to not land on the ground.
[168:32.75]Toughness.
[168:38.17]Special.
[168:41.05]Special.
[168:42.51]Toughness.
[168:43.67]Special.
[168:45.39]Toughness.
[168:45.73]27 points.
[168:46.11]Here comes the rebirth at 1.1 million.
[168:48.79]Do it.
[168:54.66]Go.
[168:55.04]I just want to see what it looks like.
[169:00.64]I forgot about the money.
[169:03.42]You have been immensely distracting me.
[169:10.60]It's okay.
[169:11.93]So, I just need to know.
[169:13.67]Where is the cap now?
[169:15.57]1500 energy points.
[169:16.51]Nice.
[169:18.77]Alright, I just want to see.
[169:21.91]How much is one point is worth?
[169:23.44]Two billion, three billion, four billion.
[169:25.58]We're already at billions?
[169:28.04]Holy shit.
[169:32.98]My head hurts.
[169:37.64]Take a couple of aspirin.
[169:40.55]Or like acetaminophen.
[169:41.15]If you're sensitive to aspirin, take acetaminophen.
[169:43.77]Sensitive to that, use ibuprofen.
[169:46.05]Maybe grab like an aspirin or so.
[169:49.15]And take a break off the computer, you know?
[169:50.67]Just take a break from the computer.
[169:52.65]If you're on the computer for too long, it irritates your skin, you know what I mean?
[169:58.22]You gotta put on sunscreen.
[170:00.14]See, but the problem, I think, is your screen's brightness is so high, you're not wearing sunscreen.
[170:04.42]Like, come on.
[170:06.68]Alright, uh... Let's just go.
[170:09.50]I wanna just click through these.
[170:10.78]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[170:17.22]Without even doing anything.
[170:18.12]I just wanna see.
[170:19.50]Trillion.
[170:20.14]Bring it down.
[170:20.98]This guy was a pain in the ass.
[170:32.70]What about if my nose hurts?
[170:33.68]Should I take a break from breathing?
[170:45.72]No.
[170:46.58]You should breathe.
[170:48.50]Why am I not doing well?
[170:49.58]I just wanna see.
[170:55.39]Uh oh, right now.
[170:56.29]Like, right now.
[171:06.53]Right now.
[171:08.45]When I just didn't go immediately to hot lava.
[171:13.34]The person that was mad that I was still here.
[171:16.29]Like, the alarm sounded in their room.
[171:21.71]Hold on.
[171:25.85]It's like, wait, he's still... He's still in the game.
[171:30.00]What's he still doing in the game?
[171:33.12]Why is he still in here?
[171:36.23]What are you doing in here?
[171:58.09]Okay, so what happened there?
[172:00.19]I went a little too hard.
[172:01.03]I went a little too hard and I kind of like made myself a little dizzy.
[172:07.83]I went too hard.
[172:15.63]I was like bracing and pushing blood into my head and... What the fuck was that?
[172:23.88]He pooped his pants.
[172:28.19]That would be a real alarm that I would have to leave if that happened.
[172:41.91]Hold on.
[172:44.13]I'm good.
[172:56.14]Got him.
[172:58.95]Only 295 rebirth points?
[173:03.69]What?
[173:11.35]Oh, I'm supposed to leave.
[173:12.39]Right.
[173:12.59]I'm supposed to leave.
[173:13.29]Alright.
[173:13.49]Let me just get, I need to get to my cap.
[173:15.70]Okay.
[173:16.44]That's important.
[173:17.78]Let me get to the cap.
[173:21.78]Let me, I just, let me get to the cap.
[173:24.24]I just need to get to the cap.
[173:25.84]Calm down.
[173:27.53]Turn it off.
[173:28.63]Don't worry.
[173:29.37]You're gonna get your lava video game.
[173:38.00]Oh, fuck.
[173:38.42]Adventure.
[173:39.02]Right.
[173:39.32]Idle it.
[173:39.62]I'm going.
[173:40.16]I'm good.
[173:42.30]In the sewers.
[173:44.90]I want lava.
[173:45.64]I want lava.
[173:46.40]I want lava.
[173:47.16]You'll get it.
[173:48.86]Why do I have artifacting on my webcam?
[173:52.11]Why does my webcam look like it's underwater?
[173:53.57]That's weird.
[173:55.32]Lava video game now.
[173:56.42]Lava video game now.
[173:57.40]Lava video game now.
[174:00.02]Just wait.
[174:04.30]I need to get my cap so I can be running in the background.
[174:07.26]Do you know how many rebirth continuation multipliers are going to exist after playing the lava game for 20 minutes?
[174:19.07]We want numbers.
[174:24.43]Shit, hold on.
[174:28.68]Alright, I gotta, let me... I need to get to 12, or 1500.
[174:32.04]I am very close to doing 10k.
[174:44.03]Let me slow you down a little.
[174:45.69]Let me just, like, even you out.
[174:47.45]Let's see.
[174:50.67]We're gonna melt faster than the lava.
[174:56.83]What can you say?
[174:57.23]The guy likes numbers going up.
[175:00.32]Thank you.
[175:01.58]To that person.
[175:03.12]You get it.
[175:05.35]You get it.
[175:07.23]I like it.
[175:13.57]You get it.
[175:17.65]Tree dead.
[175:18.79]Giant.
[175:20.93]Let me just beat the giant and we'll go.
[175:22.44]And I'm actually going to minimize it.
[175:24.54]Watch me.
[175:24.88]I'm going to click the minimize.
[175:27.50]And I'm going to open hot lava.
[175:30.95]I'm gonna laugh my ass off if Hot Lava is a bad game.
[175:49.93]At least it's a game.
[175:54.47]What's this then?
[175:57.86]You can make a game out of anything.
[175:59.10]Guys, I can make a game out of... Sit like 10 or like... You go to like preschool, you can make a... Who can count to 10 the fastest?
[176:08.62]That's a game.
[176:11.39]I'm gonna throw this cup in the air and catch it.
[176:13.37]I'm gonna make up a game called throw the cup in the air and catch the cup.
[176:17.67]I just played a game.
[176:23.65]I mean, you can make a game out of anything.
[176:26.40]How about leak all photos?
[176:27.80]That's a game.
[176:28.36]Leak all photos, personal photos, to my Twitter.
[176:31.50]I mean, that's a game.
[176:34.65]Wait.
[176:40.15]Alright, we're almost there.
[176:52.76]I got it.
[176:54.80]I'm eating spit.
[176:57.78]There we go.
[176:59.72]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[177:00.84]More of this.
[177:03.14]I just gotta get to a point where I can beat it.
[177:04.84]Alright, cap that out.
[177:06.74]Alright.
[177:07.78]We are going... What?
[177:11.45]I have to beat the giant.
[177:12.41]The giant is boss 14.
[177:16.39]Thank you, Quack.
[177:17.55]Thank you, Quackuck, for the five community subs.
[177:20.20]Thank you, Quack.
[177:23.20]We're good.
[177:24.44]But thank you, Quack.
[177:29.61]I have to beat this guy.
[177:30.67]Just give me a minute.
[177:31.57]Rebirth.
[177:32.61]20,000.
[177:32.65]Not bad.
[177:33.15]Not good.
[177:34.19]Not great.
[177:35.77]Pull this down.
[177:36.53]More into here.
[177:40.27]Just dump every point.
[177:41.53]What's the cap?
[177:42.41]15, 15.
[177:45.54]What does he have for, uh... Oh, my inventory.
[177:48.26]Fuck.
[177:49.14]Cubes.
[177:50.68]How many times can I merge the cube?
[177:51.52]69 accessory.
[177:52.06]LOL.
[177:52.14]Oh, huh.
[177:57.87]What's this at?
[177:58.95]64?
[177:58.97]69.
[178:04.09]Yeah.
[178:06.61]This is special.
[178:07.92]I mean, energy speed is important.
[178:10.04]35.
[178:14.42]I have 16.
[178:18.76]His defense is not good.
[178:20.37]I just need to have some more... I have to have more defense.
[178:24.51]That'll help.
[178:26.31]Equip the poop.
[178:30.28]If I hear the word poop one more time, I am going to be very, very, very angry.
[178:38.40]Here it comes.
[178:38.84]Now we're all gonna write it.
[178:40.28]Right?
[178:40.96]That's the joke, right?
[178:42.64]Streamer says the thing.
[178:44.65]Don't do this.
[178:45.73]Oh, if I hear that again.
[178:47.41]You guys do this one more time and then everybody does it.
[178:55.33]You won't be hearing anything because the chat is audio.
[178:57.01]Is it not audio?
[179:02.42]Here we go.
[179:04.52]Uh, I should be able to do it now.
[179:07.56]Come on.
[179:08.62]Drain, drain, drain, drain, drain, drain, drain, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5.
[179:17.15]Almost there.
[179:22.55]Get this up.
[179:23.27]Alright, I'm at the cap.
[179:24.95]We're almost going to minimize this game.
[179:29.07]We're gonna minimize this and right behind it is gonna be Doki Doki Literature Club.
[179:47.07]Look at this shit-eating grin.
[179:55.63]Done.
[179:55.95]Okay.
[179:56.61]I got it.
[179:57.51]Now, all we have to do is allocate our points correctly.
[180:02.25]I have 1550.
[180:03.03]I want, like, 800 here.
[180:08.81]I want, like, 750 here.
[180:12.80]Good.
[180:13.56]We're going to let this run in the background.
[180:15.92]I'm going to kill this guy.
[180:17.10]He's now going to be dead.
[180:18.38]The giant has been vanquished.
[180:20.80]Rat of unusual size is the next boss.
[180:24.04]Okay.
[180:24.24]Okay.
[180:25.63]How many rebirth points did that get me?
[180:27.19]Not very many, but enough.
[180:29.73]Now, we wait.
[180:31.57]We sit.
[180:33.09]I clean up my inventory.
[180:35.56]And then we upgrade everything.
[180:36.90]This is at full toughness.
[180:40.08]Not anymore.
[180:40.68]Now I can do another one.
[180:43.28]Go into here.
[180:45.72]Alright.
[180:46.96]Let it run in the background.
[180:51.03]See?
[180:51.35]I'm a man of my word.
[180:52.11]We're going to play Hot Lava.
[180:57.59]Alright, hold on.
[180:59.01]Just give me one sec.
[181:02.97]I need to, like, not capture this.
[181:09.26]Okay.
[181:09.90]It might be loud.
[181:10.64]I'm just going to warn you because I can't turn it off right now.
[181:13.44]And this music is also going to be turned off as well because there's music in Hot Lava.
[181:18.54]I have to change the name of the title of the game, too, to Hot Lava.
[181:22.91]Wait, this is on Steam.
[181:23.79]Can I run two games on Steam at the same time?
[181:27.73]Wait.
[181:32.25]You can?
[181:32.84]I thought, wait, can you?
[181:34.56]I thought, maybe, back?
[181:36.78]Let's try, see what happens.
[181:38.88]It's gonna be loud, it's gonna be loud, it's gonna be loud.
[181:40.16]Hold on, I'll turn it off.
[181:42.10]Right?
[181:42.42]Okay.
[182:44.19]Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.
[182:49.30]There.
[182:50.80]Should I even move the camera?
[182:53.92]Whatever, I'm already in that same spot.
[182:55.60]Alright, let's go.
[182:57.47]This is Hot Lava.
[182:58.67]It's a game about parkouring.
[183:47.06]This just looks like I'm like a stock trader.
[183:50.68]And I'm so obsessed with keeping up to date on like the tickers and the ups and downs that I have to have it on the screen.
[184:00.35]I can't miss anything.
[184:01.29]I'm a Forex trader.
[184:03.73]What if it goes down by 0.2 cents and I don't fucking sell it?
[184:10.68]Let's go.
[184:13.26]Alright, let's do it.
[184:14.42]You have no friends.
[184:19.24]Gym class.
[184:20.00]I don't know how any of this works.
[184:21.02]I can't hear.
[184:29.90]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[184:31.97]I gotta... Hold on.
[184:32.59]I gotta turn the, uh...
[184:46.43]That... Oh, okay.
[184:48.03]That's alright.
[184:48.47]That's not terrible.
[184:51.34]No, no, no, no, no.
[184:51.84]Don't discard.
[184:52.50]Okay.
[184:57.28]How do I... Okay, so WASD.
[185:01.06]Am I crouching?
[185:06.29]How many milliseconds?
[185:07.27]Milliseconds?
[185:09.47]Somebody just got killed.
[185:10.31]What do you mean somebody got killed?
[185:12.75]There's no lava yet.
[185:13.81]Is there a sprint?
[185:14.31]No.
[185:15.11]No.
[185:29.89]Uh, what do I need to do?
[185:32.69]Is this teaching me how to play?
[185:33.65]I think this is just... Ooh, there's a... Alright.
[185:38.45]Trampoline trouble.
[185:39.31]Oh, it's like Mario!
[185:40.07]It's like Super Mario!
[185:41.15]When you go through the painting!
[185:42.00]Alright, what's this one?
[185:51.66]Gym Jam.
[185:53.28]Make your way to the gym and we'll run through some basics of the game.
[185:56.08]Alright, let's go.
[185:57.98]Ooh, alright.
[186:05.25]MonkaS.
[186:08.53]How do I play?
[186:10.47]Don't touch the lava.
[186:12.61]Who are you?
[186:15.35]Wait.
[186:16.21]Is this a multiplayer game?
[186:27.45]Press action to skip.
[186:28.39]I went in the lava.
[186:32.82]There are people in this game.
[186:36.41]Swing like Indy, I know you wanna.
[186:39.44]Jump to grab ropes and pipes.
[186:46.44]Alright, that's cool.
[186:48.80]What's next?
[186:50.88]That person, that person's hacking.
[186:55.06]Oh, there's a pipe.
[186:56.02]Crouch or jump to get off of a pipe.
[187:02.54]Hold forward when jumping to launch forward.
[187:04.72]Easy.
[187:06.76]I still have, wait, what?
[187:07.74]Swing on the bars!
[187:13.07]Swing with forward and back, so I can go like this.
[187:33.88]Jump at the correct time on the trampolines to go hot.
[187:35.90]What do you mean, jump on the... Jump on the trampoline at the correct time.
[187:40.24]What do you mean, the correct time?
[187:41.36]Oh, I see.
[187:44.82]Like, you just have to jump on it.
[187:47.78]Like that.
[187:48.88]And like that.
[187:52.68]Moss?
[187:53.44]Putty is sticky.
[187:54.32]Use it to jump off walls.
[187:57.96]Oh.
[187:59.46]Keep looking straight ahead to keep your momentum, so it's like a surf.
[188:03.14]Ooh, alright, that's cool.
[188:05.60]You can slide a short distance when stuck to a wall.
[188:08.28]Sick!
[188:16.79]How are these people in my game?
[188:23.17]Oh, is this checkpoint or something?
[188:32.80]They're just ghosts.
[188:33.48]What do you mean, ghosts?
[188:36.12]Should I go this way?
[188:38.24]Whoa, the hell?
[188:39.70]I got the golden pin!
[188:40.60]I got the golden pin!
[188:42.48]I found a golden pin.
[188:44.91]So this is a slider.
[188:47.55]Oh shit, okay.
[188:48.83]Is that speed?
[188:51.05]What's on the bottom?
[188:59.49]Oh, this way, okay.
[189:10.95]I'm going too far.
[189:11.89]Oh shit.
[189:24.01]Got it.
[189:28.68]This is actually pretty fun.
[189:31.74]Rank 2.
[189:32.72]New character available.
[189:35.32]New world available.
[189:36.30]Playground.
[189:38.77]Playful Nyanya.
[189:40.87]Watermelon, nature's candy.
[189:42.97]Slow clap, bravo.
[189:45.67]A martial artist.
[189:47.09]Must have one for taking down the bad guys.
[189:52.30]I did it.
[189:53.50]He's trying so hard.
[189:59.42]Me?
[189:59.68]Okay, I unlocked trampoline trouble.
[190:23.00]That's 3.2 million coming up.
[190:24.40]Alright, for a second I thought it was still on the screen.
[190:30.23]Okay.
[190:32.51]So let's go to the next one.
[190:33.53]Over here.
[190:41.63]He's addicted to the idle game.
[190:43.28]For today.
[190:44.34]I'll never play it ever again after today.
[190:45.84]Alright, trampoline trouble.
[190:48.22]This is the first real test.
[190:49.24]And...
[190:56.52]That was pathetic.
[190:58.06]That was just pathetic.
[191:00.34]You can throw it further than that.
[191:01.68]Seriously.
[191:02.12]Alright, does it count if it's not a basketball?
[191:14.67]I don't need the achievement.
[191:15.37]I don't care.
[191:16.59]Time is counting right now.
[191:17.75]Up.
[191:22.79]Up.
[191:23.69]Up!
[191:28.77]Well, there's no players in here anymore.
[191:43.20]Turn off the piano.
[191:43.96]You don't want to turn the music off.
[191:48.48]I don't know where the fuck it is.
[191:50.08]Where'd it go?
[191:50.58]That way?
[191:50.92]What was that?
[192:08.17]Oops.
[192:10.75]Trampolines.
[192:11.85]One.
[192:13.43]Two.
[192:16.03]Switch the screens.
[192:17.94]What are you talking about?
[192:18.54]Switch?
[192:18.78]What?
[192:18.96]What do you mean switch?
[192:21.10]What are you saying?
[192:23.74]What do you want to switch my screen?
[192:26.86]How is this worse than the number game?
[192:29.53]I told you!
[192:31.33]I told you that this was gonna happen!
[192:46.01]I told you.
[192:50.12]I can play this game in the corner.
[193:04.10]I... Just give me like 20 minutes.
[193:14.69]Just split screen it.
[193:16.31]Do like an old co-op game.
[193:25.24]Who's playing the piano?
[193:28.50]I don't know.
[193:29.16]Completed in under a minute.
[193:30.49]I'll try it.
[193:32.65]Go.
[193:42.81]One minute.
[193:53.94]What the fuck?
[193:54.63]Oh, right.
[194:23.98]Over, across.
[194:24.78]Second trampoline.
[194:38.37]Watch this.
[194:39.01]It's a tricky jump.
[194:40.23]There it is.
[194:40.65]Right across.
[194:47.88]Bingo.
[194:49.02]Last one.
[195:09.11]What?
[195:11.79]What are you showing me here?
[195:13.15]He keeps doing the face.
[195:16.34]This is a new emotion.
[195:32.47]Oh my fucking god!
[195:34.85]I did not look like that!
[195:37.37]Do I look like this?
[195:39.51]Holy shit!
[195:49.13]I'm being, like, sucked into a tube!
[195:55.70]I'm being sucked into a fucking, like, tunnel!
[196:01.10]All you need is to have, like, air sounds.
[196:14.42]Like, look at this photo and listen to this shit.
[196:18.92]What the fuck, man?
[196:20.90]This is why I don't have facecam turned on.
[196:23.28]Ever.
[196:24.46]Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.
[196:25.84]And I mean ever.
[196:26.60]Because I just look like a fucking sicko.
[196:45.44]Alright, what was I doing?
[196:46.10]Right, over here.
[196:46.62]I don't know, I looked over at my OBS and I saw that huge yellow and orange explosion.
[196:53.19]I thought that was a huge bit thing.
[196:55.35]I thought that was like 10,000 bits.
[196:56.75]I was about to thank somebody.
[196:59.53]Alright.
[197:01.81]Let me add this.
[197:09.85]What the fuck?
[197:17.09]This is the noise that I hear when I see this image.
[197:27.38]No!
[197:28.34]No, please!
[197:28.82]I don't want to get sucked up!
[197:45.10]Thanks for that image.
[197:46.42]I won.
[197:47.16]Over here, what did I get for rebirth?
[197:49.02]8.6 fucking million!
[197:54.41]Holy shit, my neck.
[197:55.59]I... I know, man.
[198:00.07]I know.
[198:02.21]Wait, let me just make sure this is all good.
[198:03.47]Okay, not good yet.
[198:05.21]Let's get some more training.
[198:07.19]Okay, spend experience 4410k.
[198:13.41]Guys, I need to make this bigger so you can see, because this is important to me.
[198:17.70]This is important to me.
[198:20.16]Okay?
[198:21.00]Important to me.
[198:24.64]Why is it still taking over my computer?
[198:26.34]What the fuck are you talking about?
[198:29.23]Uh, I'm about to do 10,000 energy.
[198:46.23]Just kidding.
[198:47.75]What do I do?
[198:48.23]I have 44 experience.
[198:49.53]What do I do?
[198:52.53]Put both games in the corner.
[198:53.94]No.
[198:55.48]I'm gonna do base energy.
[199:03.04]Energy speed.
[199:13.51]Good.
[199:16.44]Alright, back to what I was doing.
[199:21.99]Keep it like that.
[199:22.79]No, I'm not going to keep it like that.
[199:24.03]Let's go.
[199:26.77]I got the Sculpted Plastic Construction Means No Mustache Wax Required item.
[199:34.97]Alright, so that was good.
[199:35.67]I'm missing Wizard Music.
[199:45.67]Okay, save those changes.
[199:50.41]Alright, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, wanna, wanna, what do I wanna do?
[199:53.57]Open gym, do whatever you want, run, jump, swing.
[199:59.60]Completed in under 2 minutes and 10 seconds, don't die.
[200:02.20]Let's 5-star this shit.
[200:08.74]No dying.
[200:09.30]Awful ladder.
[200:13.15]That's gonna happen again.
[200:13.92]I need to like... I need to control my face.
[200:20.74]I know it's gonna happen again.
[200:21.58]He's gonna be slow.
[200:32.61]Alright, there's one.
[200:34.35]Two minutes, right?
[200:37.15]I can do that.
[200:38.05]That's easy.
[200:43.22]What the fuck I was grabbing onto it?
[200:49.23]Last try.
[200:53.37]What's this game called?
[200:58.21]That person just fucked me up.
[201:00.80]That person just screwed me up.
[201:14.60]Alright, I can do this.
[201:15.66]Just do it simple.
[201:17.24]Two minutes is a long time.
[201:22.36]This is like the... My mousepad's coming off of the goddamn thing.
[201:31.23]I know!
[201:31.63]Get off the screen!
[201:39.57]What?
[201:40.83]Oh no, my momentum's gone.
[201:47.62]Skip.
[202:45.25]I was right here, too.
[202:46.65]God, come on.
[202:47.57]A new unlock.
[202:50.48]What do they do?
[202:51.16]Unlocks?
[202:51.50]I'm using a default avatar.
[202:54.74]Yeah, I'm not paying for it.
[203:16.08]Just don't die.
[203:16.66]I don't have to beat it at any time.
[203:17.72]Just don't die.
[203:18.82]Do it slow.
[203:26.39]Hair is getting in my face.
[203:37.23]How am I making it worse?
[203:44.17]Who the fuck is this?
[203:48.21]Wait, is that me?
[203:57.19]I gotta beat this motherfucker!
[203:58.33]Got him.
[204:15.74]Oh, he got confused over there!
[204:30.15]No deaths.
[204:30.87]No deaths.
[204:31.66]And beat time.
[204:35.06]How we doing on the idle game?
[204:38.30]That was me.

[204:48.20]120.
[204:48.42]Now start strafing and bee hopping.
[204:57.05]I think you're asking a little much.
[204:59.71]Wait.
[205:06.61]43 million.
[205:07.53]Another 10 minutes here.
[205:08.71]Alright, that's good.
[205:10.59]Fight the boss.
[205:11.33]Fight it.
[205:12.29]I can't fight it yet.
[205:14.10]Keep it going.
[205:14.74]Keep it going.
[205:15.66]What about inventory?
[205:16.98]Oh, not good.
[205:17.72]Hold on.

[205:52.58]We're done.
[205:53.12]I'm ready.
[205:58.62]Prank caller?
[205:59.32]What do you mean prank?
[206:01.04]Is somebody prank calling me?
[206:02.06]What do you mean?
[206:05.98]Do a third game in another window.
[206:10.00]I can't.
[206:10.76]I'm not going to be able to do that.
[206:11.74]Alright, I'm going to go over here and get five stars on this one.
[206:16.43]I'm pretty good at this game, I think.
[206:19.10]I don't even know- I don't know what the- what are the- Don't perform any swings, don't die, and grab the golden pin.
[206:26.96]No swinging.
[206:30.30]How the fuck am I supposed to do that?
[206:31.44]No swinging?
[206:33.00]And don't die.
[206:39.49]My profile picture.
[206:40.49]Yeah, my profile picture is an awesome way to hide online.
[206:45.59]Golden pin is probably the home one.
[206:48.74]Because that's a default Team Fortress 2 avatar.
[206:55.90]Oh, I can't land on that.
[207:01.88]How do I do this?
[207:08.31]I have to do it like that.
[207:19.10]Oh, wrong.
[207:21.18]Just don't swing.
[207:21.78]Don't swing!
[207:22.30]Okay.
[207:33.84]I didn't swing.
[207:34.50]I'm just trying to get one of them.
[207:39.62]No swing.
[207:47.32]Didn't say anything about bouncing, right?
[208:08.46]Now what are you guys doing?
[208:11.42]New World School!
[208:12.48]Uh, okay, I'm gonna go to my avatar and do some stuff.
[208:16.16]It's the same image, you just stretch the sides of my mouth.
[208:34.08]I have to rebirth this in... When this gets to 60 minutes, I'm doing rebirth.
[208:39.40]And then I'm changing over here.
[208:41.70]We're going to do the same thing we just did.
[208:43.30]This one will be in the corner.
[208:44.55]This one will be bigger.
[208:47.95]Not now yet.
[208:49.19]Not yet.
[208:49.77]Not now.
[208:52.97]You've got so many emotes.
[208:54.01]I don't even know what I would call that.
[208:57.54]What would that emote even be called?
[208:59.40]GermaTube?
[208:59.70]GermaTube?
[209:03.03]Jerma suction jermaSour it's like I can't like yeah I like jermaSour is the best one alright I'm gonna um it's gonna be that tomorrow I have 24 hours to do that alright uh back to the boss um
[209:34.11]Okay.
[209:34.73]You guys don't need to see this shit.
[209:37.24]It's taken away.
[209:37.74]You can see it.
[209:38.14]I want you guys to see it.
[209:38.96]It's time.
[209:39.58]Alright, new zone.
[209:41.42]Wait.
[209:42.04]I want to go to the menu?
[209:47.46]Yeah.
[209:48.84]Toy shelf.
[209:51.00]Lexplora.
[210:04.19]Alright, we're doing the seagull head.
[210:08.65]Mustache pin.
[210:11.33]Thumbs down.
[210:13.56]Uh, blue laser.
[210:14.22]I don't have it.
[210:15.52]Watermelon in the background.
[210:16.70]Sounds good.
[210:18.64]Let's go!
[210:24.62]Playground.
[210:25.14]Gym class.
[210:25.82]There's a lot of fucking stuff in this game, huh?
[210:31.28]Damn.
[210:42.22]They won't.
[210:42.90]That's been debunked.
[210:51.24]Why is the camera mirrored?
[210:52.20]Because I was playing a different game before and it had to be mirrored because I was looking in the right spot.
[210:56.96]Alright, new place unlocked.
[210:57.88]Where is it?
[211:03.39]I got five in there.
[211:04.41]Not gonna get five up there.
[211:07.01]This way?
[211:09.00]Where's the level?
[211:13.02]Didn't I unlock a new... Down here?
[211:16.97]There we go.
[211:20.01]What's the yellow bar at the bottom?
[211:22.45]I don't know.
[211:23.23]I don't know.
[211:27.93]Balance?
[211:30.22]Maybe it's balance.
[211:31.74]Jump timing?
[211:34.94]Wait, you mean like...
[211:41.61]Oh no, you actually do bunny hop.
[211:53.69]Well, that's advanced techniques you're not going to get on this screen.
[211:55.96]Sorry.
[212:18.56]I think you gotta do that, though.
[212:19.86]From here to here?
[212:21.52]And then twice?
[212:22.44]No.
[212:23.18]All the way across.
[212:27.18]Yeah, okay.
[212:27.82]I guess that is an advanced technique.
[212:32.50]Wait, is there something over here?
[212:38.28]Did I skip the whole thing?
[212:42.05]I think I skipped the whole level.
[212:48.18]Just win.
[212:48.75]I'm trying.
[212:51.46]I'm trying to just win.
[213:14.26]This used to be a numbers going upstream.
[213:16.44]Feels bad, man.
[213:17.76]Yeah.
[213:23.63]Fist pump.
[213:24.19]And it's still going on in the background.
[213:28.11]We'll be checking in on it soon.
[213:32.57]God, I missed that game.
[213:36.00]Grab the golden pin.
[213:37.68]I can't do that.
[213:40.66]So a new session over here.
[213:43.61]What do I do to get this?
[213:44.33]Requirement beats, surfing surfaces.
[213:47.06]Oh, this one's gonna be hell.
[213:48.90]Pogo?
[213:55.24]Pogo stick?
[214:02.11]So it's not just jumping, there's items too.
[214:24.72]Whoa!
[214:24.94]That was fun.
[214:29.60]Easy mode.
[214:30.18]Celebrate your minor victory.
[214:40.91]So I'm assuming I need to use that somewhere else?
[214:46.11]So this is a sliding level.
[214:49.13]Use the sliding surfaces.
[214:50.27]I keep seeing that picture over here and it's freaking me the fuck out.
[214:58.25]Oh, fuck.
[215:01.49]Landing on surf objects from higher makes you go faster.
[215:05.87]Right?
[215:06.53]What?
[215:13.09]Oh, I'm bunny hopping now.
[215:14.31]He figured it out, folks.
[215:20.01]Damn, that was crazy.
[215:30.32]Flick away from objects to disconnect and keep your speed.
[215:34.34]Flick away from objects.
[215:41.95]What do you mean flick away?
[215:43.66]Like with your hand?
[216:02.03]People are going to get really good at something like this.
[216:18.00]Wholesale.
[216:19.36]Clown shoes.
[216:20.42]Better put those on immediately.
[216:30.85]Pole vault.
[216:34.09]What else is over here?
[216:34.81]This opened up.
[216:36.49]Oh, what's this?
[216:37.69]Tiny toy trial.
[216:40.53]Get to the finish line.
[216:43.92]Tiny toy.
[216:47.22]If you're good at something, then we'll do it for free.
[216:48.96]I agree.
[216:52.62]We're in third person?
[216:53.74]What is a battery?
[217:01.05]Oh, I get speed.
[217:06.71]time?
[217:44.23]The music is playing based on my speed.
[217:45.83]That is cool.
[217:46.38]I need to go faster though.
[217:47.32]I gotta start back here.
[218:21.85]Was this the Don't Starve devs?
[218:25.18]Really?
[218:28.94]That's kind of interesting.
[218:29.66]That's cool.
[218:33.89]Whoa, did you see?
[218:34.51]He went so fast!
[218:37.71]Do that again!
[218:38.23]Do that again every day!
[218:39.23]Five times a day!
[218:39.97]Alright, pole vault.
[218:53.32]pole vault.
[218:53.96]Wait.
[218:57.29]Okay.
[218:57.59]So here are the poles, and how do I use them?
[219:08.36]Oh shit.
[219:09.08]What?
[219:10.26]How do I just stand on top?
[219:24.03]And he's been drinking.
[219:44.95]I've been drinking coffee.
[219:58.39]This is why I can't have a facecam on!
[220:00.73]I'm too strange!
[220:05.14]I can feel how strange I'm being.
[220:08.38]But before I wouldn't care, because I wouldn't be on camera.
[220:18.92]Okay.
[220:24.63]He's becoming odd.
[220:25.61]I'm unlocking worlds.
[220:29.78]I'm doing a whole lot of good here.
[220:33.00]Cowboy hat.
[220:34.66]Knapsack.
[220:36.20]Dragon horns.
[220:40.60]Chase your sister.
[220:48.17]I can do that in a minute, in ten seconds.
[221:18.44]What the fuck is in my way?
[222:11.76]Did I do it?
[222:15.26]I didn't lose to the ghost.
[222:19.54]I didn't get it.
[222:19.96]A minute and ten seconds, get the fuck in there.
[222:31.84]Restart.
[222:51.59]Trying to go too fast.
[223:14.94]Get it!
[223:34.93]God damn it, I fucking hit my face.
[224:08.79]I get it, I got it.
[224:14.87]Minute 10.
[224:17.13]Three seconds to spare.
[224:20.99]Alright, I got three out of that one.
[224:22.91]What's chasing my sister?
[224:26.15]Down here?
[224:27.71]Alright, this one's called intermediate difficulty.
[224:30.89]Okay, try to catch me.
[224:35.01]This one's hard.
[224:37.90]Alright, we're going for the hard one.
[224:45.09]When do we start?
[224:58.20]I had it too, that was doing pretty well.
[224:59.46]Come on, up!
[225:04.49]I gotta land these bunny hops better too.
[225:07.19]Fucking idiot.
[225:28.60]I'm so mad!
[225:30.46]Did he have a meltdown already?
[225:31.44]No.
[225:31.84]No meltdowns tonight.
[225:46.57]Alright, stop paying attention to the fucking bunny hop, you're never gonna get it.
[226:42.81]She was waiting for me!
[226:44.08]To taunt me!
[227:21.36]Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry.
[227:26.68]Oh, I think he's gonna fucking cry.
[227:41.94]What the fuck am I doing?
[227:43.42]You like have to bunny hop, otherwise you can't make that jump.
[228:18.39]Back to the numbers game.
[228:20.29]Fuck.
[228:21.77]It's counting in the background.
[228:22.83]It's gotta focus completely.
[228:40.38]No talking.
[228:41.36]No streaming.
[228:41.96]Just do it.
[230:06.05]Alright, if I try to bunny hop one more time... I am just, just, go.
[230:14.28]Just do it.
[230:15.14]I'm like, go!
[230:19.19]No, just do it!
[230:36.95]Probably on camera looks like I'm trying to get a piece of popcorn out of my fucking teeth at the movie theater I'm making fucking jokes This is the one right here
[231:28.90]Itchy nose.
[231:29.54]Inside of my nose is itching like crazy.
[231:33.80]I just snorted itching powder.
[232:07.14]Somebody said... Who the fuck are you?
[232:11.61]Oh no, now I can't lose because this person's gonna show me up looking bad.
[232:36.55]They fell, they fell, they fell.
[232:37.57]Okay, now I don't feel bad.
[232:47.10]It was that easy.
[232:51.91]That was not even that hard.
[232:53.79]I made that way harder on myself.
[233:03.88]He was literally pretending.
[233:06.19]Did you see the other guy fall?
[233:10.51]Pretending.
[233:11.95]The guy in front of me too?
[233:13.53]Guy went like this?
[233:15.61]Okay.
[233:24.01]What's in here?
[233:25.47]No.
[233:30.05]Alright, there it is.
[233:34.15]New session, new little mini-game here.
[233:37.63]All Course Marathon.
[233:39.53]No.
[233:40.47]I know what this is and I don't want to do it.
[233:42.53]Difficulty Impossible.
[233:45.97]This is impossible.
[233:55.12]How is this impossible?
[234:37.47]I'm not doing it.
[234:45.46]Alright, what's happening here?
[234:48.32]What's over here?
[234:51.16]I see a door hit this way.
[234:52.34]What's in the computer lab?
[234:53.24]I don't know.
[235:09.03]I think I've seen everything.
[235:13.15]Play the numbers.
[235:14.13]No, no, no.
[235:14.61]We're just going to keep that one counting.
[235:18.51]Maybe one little peek.
[235:28.87]Maybe just a little peek, you know?
[235:36.61]How we doing?
[235:39.45]Alright, I got two quadrillion.
[235:42.10]Ooh, hold on.
[235:43.40]Rebirth.
[235:44.84]145 fucking million for rebirth.
[235:49.50]Okay.
[235:50.80]Experience.
[235:51.34]10 EXP.
[235:52.28]We're gonna do energy speed.
[235:54.80]And we're gonna do it again.
[235:56.58]We're gonna do it a few times.
[236:00.95]I'm going to go back over here to fight boss.
[236:03.01]What do we need?
[236:05.39]317 versus 148.
[236:05.82]273.
[236:05.84]I need more defense.
[236:07.90]This is going to be close, but I need defense.
[236:13.60]So I'm going to go into here.
[236:14.72]Basic training.
[236:16.26]Pull this out.
[236:16.96]Put it in here.
[236:18.82]We've got to get a little bit more defense.
[236:22.54]Money pit.
[236:23.26]A million bucks is going in the money pit.
[236:25.60]Dump.
[236:26.56]You gain plus 0-1 health regen.
[236:30.66]I can have two hours from now, I have to come back and do this again.
[236:37.07]That looks alright.
[236:40.61]Fight boss.
[236:42.01]Fifteen.
[236:42.89]Let's see what happens.
[236:46.35]No, stop, stop, stop.
[236:47.26]That's not worth it.
[236:49.86]I have a hundred more than he does.
[236:55.26]And then my defense is 160 less, so we need to wait until I get this a little higher.
[237:05.67]But I got a strong attack now.
[237:08.69]What does this one do?
[237:10.67]Base attack received is 2,000 instead of 1,000.
[237:13.23]Holy shit.
[237:17.88]Yeah, yeah.
[237:20.50]Let's dump it into that.
[237:26.83]We can't see re.
[237:28.79]Yes, you can.
[237:29.45]Look.
[237:32.79]Alright.
[237:35.25]If I... That's alright.
[237:39.81]I think that's fine.
[237:40.89]Fight boss.
[237:43.08]I'll have enough here.
[237:43.98]300, I'll have enough.
[237:46.18]I might have enough now.
[237:49.22]No, I'm going down faster.
[237:50.26]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[237:51.38]We'll come back to it.
[237:54.32]Oh, you better believe we're going to be doing it again.
[237:57.38]But never again after today.
[237:59.73]I mean, like, actually, never again after today.
[238:06.65]Alright.
[238:07.05]Oh.
[238:10.01]I need to go to the next world.
[238:14.01]Wherever that is.
[238:24.76]Can I just... Quit to menu.
[238:26.76]Okay.
[238:28.89]Play.
[238:31.35]The playground.
[238:33.15]Ooh, this looks cool.
[238:38.00]Really?
[238:38.86]I get to slide on the slide?
[238:39.72]Let's go!
[238:40.00]Ooh, chess!
[239:01.94]This one's called Recess.
[239:09.46]That does take, like, a backpack?
[239:16.60]What the fuck?
[239:17.58]Okay, you gotta jump around.
[239:18.94]Across the... Okay, I personally got in my way.
[239:22.46]Alright, I'm gonna wait, because me and this guy are on the exact same... We're doing it at the same time.
[239:44.31]I'm gonna go around.
[239:49.07]Card.
[239:49.35]Did I not get it?
[239:51.78]What?
[239:53.56]How the fuck did I not get that?
[239:55.44]I don't... Where was... Where was the thing to grab?
[240:13.78]I missed it, it was right here.
[240:19.68]Whoa!
[240:25.92]You guys have to get the cards?
[240:27.22]What the fuck is this for?
[240:31.08]Climb it!
[240:32.32]Climb it!
[240:39.58]Down the slide or riot!
[240:40.68]Down the slide or riot!
[240:41.93]I can hear you!
[240:50.69]Holy shit, actually, he's downsliding.
[240:52.83]Where's the... Over there.
[240:54.65]I don't need to go this way.
[241:07.46]I have to go to the tires.
[241:09.26]I'm dead.
[241:09.68]Fall damage.
[241:10.14]I died.
[241:33.04]There we go.
[241:37.12]I just broke, my neck just like broke.
[241:56.39]Ah!
[241:57.33]It's so painful.
[241:59.37]Ugh.
[242:02.73]Learn to bunny hop or get the fuck out, right?
[242:11.04]Card.
[242:18.76]Learn to scrape or get the fuck out.
[242:26.35]What's the purpose of bunny hopping?
[242:27.33]I think it just keeps your momentum.
[242:29.13]And you just keep going faster and faster and faster and faster and faster.
[242:32.67]I think.
[242:36.93]New unlock.
[242:41.11]The big kid slide?
[242:41.89]That sounds like a fun one.
[242:45.59]Wait, let me do this.
[243:01.97]But I can get at least one cool thing.
[243:06.35]No.
[243:08.33]Oh, which one did I unlock?
[243:09.05]Where'd it go?
[243:09.99]Big kid's slide?
[243:12.45]I think it's the big kid's slide.
[243:19.03]Card.
[243:20.96]Apple!
[243:23.48]Forget about books.
[243:24.02]Give me the apple.
[243:26.28]What the hell is this place?
[243:30.74]Over here?
[243:32.96]Always pick up an apple.
[243:34.16]Always.
[243:41.87]So if I just run on the ground, I'm getting momentum just by running?
[243:51.68]Wait a second.
[244:11.98]Okay.
[244:13.50]So you have to be running a certain amount of speed first.
[244:22.39]Admin, he's doing it sideways.
[244:24.23]Am I not supposed to be doing that?
[244:25.27]I always thought bunny hopping was you have to, like, move your camera around.
[244:31.13]Like, you have to flick your face around.
[244:33.59]To, like, get momentum to, like, throw yourself.
[244:35.99]Is that correct?
[244:39.39]You do.
[244:41.09]You do, you do, okay.
[245:00.19]I could see how people would get obsessed with this game.
[245:10.79]Just trying to get every single damn thing.
[245:16.96]Where are we even going?
[245:17.66]It's like you've become so obsessed with trying to- Oh man.
[245:27.19]There are probably people that are gonna be just bunny hopping with like x10 speed and just strafe up this thing.
[245:33.76]It ain't gonna be me.
[245:34.54]I will never do that.
[245:46.83]We're going down.
[245:48.24]Slide down, slide.
[245:49.62]Slide down.
[245:56.74]Now where?
[245:57.08]Over here?
[245:59.94]This really is just kind of an open playing field.
[246:18.09]Alright.
[246:24.28]Did you hear that?
[246:25.32]Somebody had to have heard that.
[246:26.80]That was like a snapped neck.
[246:35.81]There we go.
[246:36.65]Back this way?
[246:54.78]Sorry, I did the same thing.
[247:00.38]These levels, this one was weird.
[247:01.48]It's like a Tony Hawk level.
[247:03.61]You kind of can just go anywhere you want.
[247:06.23]But there's one goal.
[247:09.09]Checkpoint 15 of 19.
[247:10.13]Not enough momentum.
[247:42.75]I can't grab that pole?
[247:43.67]What?
[247:43.85]I thought it was a grabable pole!
[248:13.06]Apparently playing Hot Lava.
[248:18.13]How the fuck do you get up there?
[248:19.53]Wait a minute.
[248:25.15]Just start from... There?
[248:27.89]Bounce bounce bounce?
[248:29.55]I guess this way.
[248:32.75]No, what?
[248:34.19]I gotta... I see that.
[248:47.82]I'm getting the Mario music.
[248:49.50]The Mario, like, hurry up music.
[248:57.42]That's what I just landed on.
[249:03.16]Numbers go up waiting room.
[249:10.66]Yeah, cool stream.
[249:11.40]Can I have your Xbox?
[249:13.02]Like, you mean you actually physically want my Xbox?
[249:17.54]Why would I give you my Xbox?
[249:23.50]Here's another pogo level.
[249:28.03]You don't want this thing.
[249:30.75]Alright, this is a checkpoint with a pogo stick.
[250:04.95]There's like an exact route you take to with this shit.
[250:33.34]I'm just nauseating.
[250:47.64]I don't have a head?
[250:51.12]What's going on?
[250:51.58]Why is this doing this?
[250:59.86]This is like a dog's asshole.
[251:17.80]Where did it open?
[251:18.38]Did anybody see it?
[251:30.37]Can you tell me where the next thing is?
[251:35.53]They can't hear me, right?
[251:37.37]Is it over here?
[251:42.34]Noooo.
[251:43.62]Chase the big kid.
[251:51.43]Alright, this is freaking me out.
[251:53.19]Quit the menu.
[251:56.25]Boy, shut up.
[251:56.73]Let's put on some new stuff.
[252:00.93]I'll stick with the bandana guy.
[252:07.70]Horns.
[252:08.44]Hat.
[252:08.82]I like the hat.
[252:11.15]Staff.
[252:12.21]Backpack.
[252:13.71]Keyboard.
[252:15.37]This is rare.
[252:17.69]Keyboard.
[252:19.91]What's this?
[252:21.41]Sneakers.
[252:23.33]Yeah, cool sneakers.
[252:25.72]Fist pump.
[252:28.38]And I want the easy button behind me.
[252:30.00]Nice.
[252:36.64]Let's go to the school.
[252:41.25]Sounds like a fun time to me.
[252:42.49]I also have to piss again.
[252:45.21]You look like Woody from Toy Story.
[252:47.43]Nice.
[252:47.80]ABCs, 1, 2, 3s!
[252:48.16]Alright, let's do it!
[253:19.19]I feel like I'm in a dungeon.
[253:20.17]By the way, this is the first song you learn on any guitar.
[253:26.59]It's the first four chords you learn.
[253:57.79]I don't know.
[253:58.23]I don't know.
[253:58.53]I don't know.
[254:02.95]Oh.
[254:04.04]I... What the fuck?
[254:12.30]Oh, come on.
[254:15.20]Thank god it just helps you.
[254:19.43]You gotta get up top.
[254:34.69]Oh, I'm getting actually upset right now.
[254:38.53]This used to be a fucking counting spree.
[255:02.76]Alright.
[255:03.96]Bounce.
[255:04.70]From... where do you want me to bounce to?
[255:10.88]Fuck.
[255:16.22]No, we both did the same exact thing at the same exact fucking time.
[255:55.12]He's waiting for me!
[255:55.86]I went the wrong way.
[256:29.25]Chair!
[256:29.77]Get- Is that lava there?
[256:31.55]I'm so confused.
[256:40.63]So I understand the whole, like, the floor is lava gimmick, but does the floor actually have to be lava in this game?
[256:48.13]Why can't it just be, don't touch the floor?
[256:57.99]Hey!
[256:58.13]Don't throw shit.
[257:03.95]Why can't it just be, don't touch the red floor?
[257:08.14]I know, it fucks up the whole thing.
[257:14.81]Otherwise it would just be a Counter-Strike map.
[257:27.04]It would just be a Garry's Mod.
[257:28.90]Custom game.
[257:29.50]I need momentum to get up there.
[257:34.37]Wait, guys, wait for me.
[257:35.49]Don't leave without me.
[257:36.45]Wait for me.
[257:38.72]Don't leave.
[257:39.96]Wait for me.
[257:58.10]I got it.
[258:05.58]I didn't touch it?
[258:06.12]What?
[258:07.66]How did I not touch this?
[258:25.02]I need to put on my own music.
[258:26.04]This music is just, like... I feel like this is like a car commercial on a radio.
[258:32.38]Hold on.
[258:33.18]I gotta get my own fucking music in here.
[258:38.23]Uh, what do I want?
[258:40.99]What do I want for music?
[258:44.51]The piano.
[258:45.47]The piano is better music.
[258:48.73]No, not Minecraft.
[258:49.69]I need something that's gonna pump me up.
[258:54.78]How about... No, not Tony Hawk.
[258:58.98]That's how you get the whole stream turned off.
[259:08.02]Sonic?
[259:10.88]What's that song?
[259:11.72]Who's the band that does all the Sonic songs?
[259:14.76]There's one band that's been doing every single theme song for like 10 years.
[259:18.02]What's that band called?

[260:32.44]Why will you truly follow your peace and pain?
[260:43.56]When you can't help but swallow, it's right back where you came.
[260:56.17]Sing it!

[264:39.21]We're good.
[264:43.20]This is now impossible.
[264:44.54]I've done my points.
[264:46.64]Wait, not yet.
[264:54.50]That was it.
[264:55.10]Somebody told me I thought I was wrong.
[264:58.60]Yeah, there it is.
[264:59.18]It's right there.

[265:47.06]What's it called?
[265:48.00]Escape the City.
[266:03.00]And this is the one that goes, rolling around at the speed of sound.
[266:07.33]Right?
[266:07.51]Something like that.
[266:39.99]Let's go.
[267:10.43]What the fuck do I do there?
[267:26.00]Where do you fucking go from here?
[267:47.50]Mobile viewers posting lyrics too late.
[267:49.64]How do I get the fuck up here?
[268:01.85]I'm gonna watch you.
[268:04.43]How are you doing this?
[268:06.21]I see.
[268:08.03]Now I see.
[268:09.89]Follow me.
[268:37.51]I'm trying to follow them.
[268:47.33]Something gonna auto-play?
[269:02.10]Stop throwing shit at me!
[269:03.66]I've got it!
[269:04.10]It's tough enough as it is for me!
[269:14.98]I bounced backwards!
[269:16.06]I need more Sonic the Hedgehog theme music for me to be able to do this.
[269:22.61]This one has seven million views.
[269:25.99]What is this one?
[269:37.20]Seven fucking million.
[269:59.21]Oh, I know this is it.
[270:00.12]If you feel... wrong.
[270:04.40]Got it wrong.
[270:06.62]This is too fucking loud.
[270:16.51]I gotta turn it down.
[270:33.54]Louder, vessel!
[270:43.74]It's not helping.
[270:45.29]The beat's wrong on this one for me.
[270:47.55]It's not helping.
[270:48.07]The other one was.
[270:50.31]My turn.
[270:50.69]Get off of that.
[270:55.35]How do I do that?
[271:00.36]Oh.
[271:03.22]Alright, up on top.
[271:04.12]I fell off.
[271:08.88]I'm just like slippery shit.
[271:11.19]It's a slippery fucking thing.
[271:14.93]What the fuck are you in the way for?
[271:33.14]Worst Sonic song by far.
[271:34.46]Like, if there's a top five, this is five.
[271:49.43]What is this?
[271:49.77]What is Fist Bump?
[271:52.51]Fist Bump.
[271:53.23]Sonic Forces.
[271:58.31]There was a Sonic Forces song?
[272:03.75]Fist bump.
[272:44.22]One second.
[272:57.65]Sorry, I have a VPN.
[272:58.51]It takes me 10 seconds to load anything.
[273:17.25]Same song.
[273:19.07]We'll listen to the real one.
[273:31.60]I listen to this way too much.
[273:32.94]I'm not even that big of an Undertale fan.
[273:35.74]But I listen to...
[273:47.21]Didn't help.
[273:48.55]I don't even know where the fuck I'm supposed to go.
[273:52.44]I have to go- I have to go down?
[273:53.36]I- I have to go over there.
[273:58.29]From here.
[274:36.66]God.
[274:38.08]What the hell?
[274:40.12]I'm here this way.
[274:40.74]Let's go.
[274:42.52]So let's jump this way, down here.
[274:44.70]Across over there, onto the loo.
[274:47.60]Nice, got it.
[274:49.40]Onto the wood!
[274:49.96]Oh, I fell down.
[274:52.05]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[274:53.93]Oh well.
[274:55.33]Try it again.
[274:55.79]Oh, swing it.
[274:59.21]Ooh, nice try.
[275:00.41]Nice try.
[275:01.05]Excellent work.
[275:03.71]Ooh, almost ate three points.
[275:20.77]I just have to go over there!
[275:22.23]Bounce!
[275:23.89]Fuck.
[275:33.18]Um... I jumped over the fucking thing.
[275:37.20]How many of these did I jump over?
[275:38.42]Ahhhh!
[276:13.47]Why is this playing again?
[276:18.71]Why is this playing again?
[276:54.32]Look at that pace.
[276:56.84]Don't look at that pace.
[276:58.32]Oh, it's megalovania for one hour.
[277:02.24]Now I know why.
[277:05.77]Oops.
[277:07.99]Ooh, got a new session.
[277:09.63]Middle school... was it middle school mischief?
[277:16.11]That one was difficult.
[277:20.75]Do it, coward.
[277:23.19]Coward, but what do you mean coward?
[277:29.31]Tape your face into a neutral position.
[277:32.71]Tape your face into a neutral position.
[277:40.00]I... What?
[277:40.48]I...
[277:54.32]And my eyes?
[277:57.63]Do it and I'll sub.
[277:59.73]Really?
[278:02.31]Really?
[278:02.97]You'll sub if I do the tape on the face thing.
[278:06.61]Or I'm gonna get acne.
[278:08.49]No.
[278:09.15]What if I just stay neutral?
[278:12.81]Like the tape residue is gonna get in my pores and I'm gonna get zits.
[278:21.09]Go get it.
[278:21.79]Get tape or no sub.
[278:24.11]Tape?
[278:24.51]What do you mean?
[278:24.99]Why do I need to tape my face into it?
[278:30.06]It clears your pores.
[278:32.92]Tape blocks your pores because it's tape.
[278:38.52]Do it.
[278:39.14]Don't sell out.
[278:40.14]Alright, one guy just said don't sell out.
[278:43.19]Okay.
[278:44.05]Yeah.
[278:45.95]I will not make a reaction.
[278:47.47]I will put artificial tape here.
[278:51.88]No reaction.
[278:52.95]If I do any reaction... No, I tried this before and it was fucking bad.
[278:58.21]Do you guys remember the don't make and don't laugh at all for like 10 straight minutes?
[279:08.53]That was horrible.
[279:10.99]Alright, no... Alright, I'll try it.
[279:14.14]No emotions for 10 straight minutes or I do 100 gifted subs.
[279:27.63]When does it start?
[279:29.85]I already fucking can't do it.
[279:38.28]Every funny thing I've ever heard in my whole life, every fucking awful thing that's ever happened to me, they're all flowing to the front of my cerebral cortex right now.
[279:47.02]And they're just like, I'm ready.
[279:48.54]I'm ready.
[279:49.22]Remember the time when you did this?
[279:51.00]Remember that funny thing?
[279:51.78]Remember the movie you watched when you really laughed?
[279:54.00]They're all getting in here.
[279:54.91]They're all getting to the front row.
[279:59.64]That was funny, but it's not... Okay.
[280:03.34]No music's gonna make me fucking laugh, too.
[280:05.63]10 minutes straight.
[280:08.67]I need to look over... Where's my timer?
[280:12.06]4 hours and 41 minutes is the stream.
[280:13.62]I gotta pee first, too.
[280:14.68]I'm going all in.
[280:15.48]I'll be right back.
[280:33.26]Hey, it's Jerma again.
[280:34.54]I'm back.
[280:34.94]I have an idea for the only reason why I would ever do MediaShare.
[280:42.14]A stream where I have to stay completely, completely emotionless while you guys do MediaShare.
[280:50.32]And you have to try to break me.
[280:58.10]Huh.
[280:58.88]Interesting scenario.
[281:00.66]Think about that.
[281:02.02]I'll sleep on that one.
[281:02.78]I'll be right back.
[282:51.06]Okay.
[282:52.20]I'm back.
[282:58.22]Let's give this a try.
[282:59.76]I get three strikes, by the way.
[283:07.94]Ten minutes.
[283:08.34]Three strikes.
[283:08.74]Yes, I do.
[283:09.70]Yes, I do.
[283:10.14]I make the rules.
[283:10.86]Okay.
[283:12.80]I make the rules.
[283:14.90]Three strikes.
[283:15.72]Ten minutes.
[283:16.46]Because I know it's going to happen.
[283:17.85]Three strikes.
[283:18.33]I make the rules.
[283:24.83]You guys get to pick the music.
[283:28.71]Come to a consensus on something.
[283:30.69]How the fuck are you going to do that in five seconds?
[283:43.78]No, not... Okay.
[283:45.20]What is... People keep writing this shit.
[283:47.04]What is this?
[283:52.02]Pumpkin Hill?

[284:04.26]Pumpkin Hill Sonic Adventure 2 music.
[284:06.26]Okay, Pumpkin Hill.
[284:08.23]Why do I remember this song somehow?
[284:10.91]Why is Chad picking the worst song?
[284:12.77]It's not me picking it.
[284:34.05]Let's go.
[284:34.39]We're not starting yet.
[284:35.77]I'll give you a big facecam just so you guys can really, really take a look.
[285:03.81]I'm not allowed to... Okay, emotionless doesn't mean I can't move my entire facial muscles.
[285:11.14]This is gonna be hard.
[285:15.44]No, emotionless means, like, no laughing, no getting angry, no... What the fuck?
[285:22.59]No... Oh, that was funny!
[285:25.23]Nothing.
[285:25.85]Just blank.
[285:27.47]But I can let go like this.
[285:32.38]Like I can like touch my face and stuff.
[285:37.81]You can't smile, I won't smile.
[285:43.14]I'm a fucking four year old.
[285:45.84]You can't do that, now I wanna do that!
[285:57.55]This thing is, this, this guy sucks.
[286:02.17]This guy sucks.
[286:05.75]That's an emotion, but it's not time.
[286:10.11]I'm waiting till the end of this song, because this is cheating for you guys.
[286:14.40]Because it needs to be at the beginning of a new song.
[286:29.36]It hasn't started yet.
[286:30.67]It hasn't started yet.
[286:34.51]No, that's not won.
[286:35.77]Let me beat this level first.
[287:03.19]No, I need momentum!
[287:05.21]I have to stand completely.
[287:09.73]I gotta stand completely fucking still, too.
[287:11.95]Well, that's not gonna happen, because I'm a fidgeter.
[287:15.28]Got it.
[287:17.92]Holy shit, that's more.
[287:38.18]Fuck They look like emerald shards Oh, I'm gonna hang on to that one now Fuck
[287:59.67]I need you to start it because you guys are throwing shit out there that is gonna fuck with me.
[288:04.29]Okay, I get three strikes starting.
[288:06.17]Okay.
[288:06.33]No emotion, no anger, no frustration, no laughing.
[288:30.65]Like this.
[288:37.57]I can't fucking do this.
[288:39.07]I can't do it.
[288:39.57]I might as well just give everybody 100 subs right now.
[288:42.39]It's impossible for me.
[288:45.93]There's no way.
[288:48.39]There is confetti that's getting stuffed down here.
[288:52.27]And somebody is just going to pull the string down here and just boom.
[288:56.02]It just builds and builds and builds and builds until it has to come out.
[289:00.80]Brick by Brick Lego Island OST.

[290:41.12]Brick by brick, clock by tick
[290:44.01]That's still part of one.
[290:45.33]Alright!
[290:45.89]Why did I do this to myself?
[290:47.81]You can move a mountain if you do it brick by brick
[291:18.82]Fuck.
[291:20.88]I just picture like a big fucking southern family on stage.
[291:24.88]They're like a huge cello.
[291:26.44]There's like a hundred, there's like twelve of them.
[291:30.14]They're all in the same family.

[292:04.80]Papa told Mama, and Laura told Nick.
[292:08.32]You can build a mountain if you do it brick.
[292:14.60]I built a cool machine, red, yellow, and black.
[292:18.34]There ain't no doodad that Steve Ice lacks.
[292:22.02]All around the island, we're going round the bend.
[292:25.22]Break it down, baby, break it up again.
[292:28.24]Tick by brick, top by tick, no matter how thin, no matter how thin.
[292:34.23]You can move a mountain, you can move a mountain, you can move a mountain if you do it brick by

[296:05.42]Somebody in chat said, this streamer doesn't talk.
[296:08.07]Why?
[296:08.71]Like, what the fuck?
[296:10.31]The music and just the... He's just sitting there playing like fucking shit.
[296:22.16]I don't know why the fuck I looked at chat.
[296:23.34]I needed two and a half more minutes.
[296:30.63]Hold on a second.
[296:31.55]Just keep the music playing.
[296:40.87]Double or nothing?
[296:41.70]No.
[296:42.18]I ain't playing that game anymore.
[296:49.02]It's this music, too.
[296:50.14]Like, what the fuck even is this music?
[296:56.40]I'll have to do it from here.
[297:03.57]Fuck I don't know how to do this every time How do I even give community subs Here we go I don't know why I play these fucking dangerous games with myself.
[297:30.18]I Continue to play play dumb games
[297:33.77]What's that?
[297:34.75]You play stupid games.
[297:38.19]Gift us.
[297:38.87]Here it is.
[297:39.27]Okay.
[297:49.39]Here we go.
[298:17.68]Congratulations.
[298:31.11]Dodged it.
[298:32.15]You dodged it.
[298:34.59]That's a free shit.
[298:37.87]I didn't get one.
[298:38.49]Do it again.
[298:38.93]Uh-oh.
[298:46.77]That was not a lie, no.
[298:53.58]Alright.
[298:54.54]Let's keep going.
[298:59.06]I'm already subscribed.
[299:00.70]What happened to the Lego Island music?
[299:04.43]That's a vacuum cleaner.
[299:11.85]What time is it?
[299:12.39]Five hours?
[299:13.29]How many?
[299:14.09]We got two hours in.
[299:15.21]I gotta rebirth this.
[299:18.97]Who even gives a shit about hot lava anymore?
[299:33.26]It's good.
[299:33.92]It's a good game.
[299:34.50]It's good.
[299:38.52]But my mind is only on numbers going up in a sequence.
[299:43.59]At the moment.
[299:48.56]Let me get to the end of this.
[299:51.82]You got one?
[299:52.30]Thanks for the sub.
[300:03.40]Yeah?
[300:03.72]There it is.
[300:04.30]Listen to one hour of vacuum without laughing.
[300:07.99]I'll do... Okay.
[300:13.24]Why is that on screen?
[300:14.82]Alright.
[300:15.52]No, not double enough and I just did it.
[300:18.32]I'll do two straight minutes of vacuum cleaner sound.
[300:23.69]Without flinching.
[300:25.73]And if I don't do it, I'll dab on stream.
[300:28.35]That's much better than the 100 community subs.
[300:33.61]Who even gives a shit about... Alright, it's a great game.
[300:36.25]It's fun.
[300:36.61]It was fun for a while.
[300:37.67]It was cool.
[300:38.75]I don't care anymore.
[300:40.49]I care about listening to vacuum cleaners.
[300:57.09]Ready?
[300:58.99]Two minutes.
[301:04.36]I need to change this to something else.
[301:06.46]Because if you're looking for hot lava gameplay and you come in here and it's a guy listening to a vacuum cleaner, you're gonna probably be sort of annoyed by that.
[301:14.47]And I don't blame you.
[301:16.07]I don't.
[301:16.37]Okay.
[301:19.71]Let's change the title.
[301:25.41]Where's my shit?
[301:28.56]There it is.
[301:30.49]Alright.
[301:37.49]I can keep the title at, uh, numbers go up.
[301:41.27]It's been like that the whole time, even with the lava one.
[301:44.94]Okay.
[301:45.10]Um, Alright, let's do it.
[301:53.34]Are you ready?
[301:56.33]So people, just so people can know,
[302:00.95]I need to put a text on the screen just so people know.
[302:06.75]Because if you come in here, you need to be curious, right?
[302:26.60]Alright.
[302:29.92]No, what the fuck is...
[302:33.02]Get back here.
[302:35.32]OK, I'm ready.
[302:36.76]I'm going to try.
[302:39.40]It's going to be loud, just to make sure everyone's aware of that.
[302:42.20]Both earphones.
[302:43.42]I'm not going to cheat.
[302:56.93]OK.
[302:58.67]Two minutes.
[302:59.57]I see it on the clock.
[303:00.68]I'm ready.
[303:01.12]Three, two, one.
[303:52.13]There's two things going on here.
[303:55.20]Somebody said, dude, use push to talk, you fucking asshole.
[304:01.60]And the second thing is you can hear the backing planet going over a rug.
[304:06.54]It goes like, going back and forth.
[304:10.10]There you go.
[304:13.90]I can do it.
[304:16.88]I've done that so many times now.
[304:19.49]Three, two, one.
[305:02.89]God.
[305:03.61]Fuck.
[305:04.35]Damn it.
[305:11.40]One, two, three, go!
[306:33.45]Dude!
[306:34.45]Fix your mic!
[306:35.89]I have the gain turned up all the fucking way!
[306:44.72]Hey guys, what's going on?
[306:49.55]Yeah, I got just my microphone can't pick me up.
[306:52.63]So I got to turn the gain all the way up.
[307:05.88]He's weak to mic... No, it's just like... I just imagine somebody fucking needing to turn their mic all the way to... How many minutes was that?
[307:22.66]It was less than two.
[307:25.12]I don't want to.
[307:36.64]I never told you they were going to be any good.
[307:39.16]How the hell am I going to do this?
[307:40.28]Okay, I need something that's... I need something else that's not a vacuum cleaner.
[307:46.54]Because I need something that you guys can't make jokes about.
[307:54.13]You know what I mean?
[307:55.45]You guys are too quick.
[308:02.50]Microwave sound.
[308:03.92]Ahhhh.
[308:08.42]I'll try it.
[308:22.81]This just sounds like an airplane.
[308:29.90]That's the same sound.
[308:32.46]Fix your fucking mic.
[308:35.08]Ah, that's the best one so far.
[308:43.37]Alright, how about, um... Saxophone?
[308:50.42]Let's see.
[308:54.55]Okay.
[308:55.73]Three, two, one.
[309:48.20]It's the fucking people in the background.
[309:51.72]It's the people that were talking.
[309:59.79]It was like street noise.
[310:03.15]A minute.
[310:20.49]I don't care if this takes me all night.
[310:22.89]I'll do it.
[310:23.23]I don't care if it takes me all night.
[310:24.63]You know what?
[310:24.91]Fuck it.
[310:25.23]Three minutes.
[310:32.56]One, two, three, go.
[310:33.06]That's the difference.
[310:34.78]What?
[310:36.26]Right.
[310:38.54]Hold on.
[310:39.92]Three, two, one, go.
[310:47.54]Three, two, three, two, one.
[310:48.72]Three.
[310:49.04]Three, two, one, go.
[312:16.64]Ha ha!
[312:51.32]Nothing was funny.
[312:52.40]It's just this one went on for a long time.
[312:56.18]This one went on for like a full like 45 seconds.
[312:59.16]Usually the first three minutes of this video was one, two, here's another saxophone, here's another saxophone.
[313:04.03]And this guy just keep playing.
[313:05.35]This guy's just going.
[313:14.12]I think my brain is
[313:17.35]There you go.
[313:18.13]Hey, there you are.
[313:19.09]I think my brain is too fucked up to do this.
[313:27.14]Every second, there's like something else in here.
[313:31.00]Give me something else.
[313:36.74]Something easy.
[313:37.30]You gotta get something easy.
[313:44.17]The beach.
[313:44.75]That actually would work pretty well, I think.
[313:48.23]I can't see myself laughing at the beach.
[313:50.89]It's the beach.
[313:53.41]It's just a beach.
[313:54.59]What's the fun?
[313:55.33]There's nothing there.
[313:56.62]Just imagine.
[313:57.52]Can I close my eyes?
[313:59.20]Can I close my eyes?
[314:00.88]I can't, right?
[314:01.60]You're not going to take that from me.
[314:05.22]Actually, that'll make it worse.
[314:06.24]Because then I'll just see images.
[314:08.62]Okay, we're gonna go with... You just laughed at a vacuum.
[314:11.80]I know.
[314:12.24]But there was a lot more going on.
[314:14.62]There were like four or five hundred different onion layers as to why the vacuum was funny.
[314:19.32]Okay, let's do the beach ambience.
[314:25.93]Blinking is also in motion.
[314:27.29]No, it's a necessary mechanism to survive.
[314:36.86]Ocean sounds for sleep.
[314:38.66]How would you think this was funny?
[314:39.90]This is not at all.
[314:41.02]Here we go.
[314:43.24]Beach ambience on tropical Paradise.
[314:53.21]Impossible to think this is funny.
[314:58.64]Ahem.
[315:01.80]Three minutes.
[315:03.22]I'm prepared.
[315:04.30]It's all out of my system at this point.
[315:06.30]Three minutes.
[315:07.80]I've been streaming for fucking five, almost five and a half hours.
[315:10.82]Three minutes is not a big deal.
[315:12.26]I can do three goddamn minutes.
[315:20.57]But hold on a second.
[315:36.34]How we doing?
[315:36.80]Fight the boss.
[315:37.82]Nope.
[315:38.80]Rebirth.
[315:40.22]Almost there.
[315:40.82]And in four minutes, I get rewarded with a hundred million.
[315:45.82]A billion.
[315:49.79]I'll figure this out later.
[315:51.25]Okay, that sounds good.
[315:52.55]Four more minutes and I can rebirth again.
[315:59.09]Just focus on the rebirth and that's it.
[316:01.86]Okay.
[316:04.88]This isn't funny, so don't laugh.
[316:06.10]I know, that's what I'm saying.
[316:06.98]This is just water sounds.
[316:10.40]Three, two, one, action.
[317:21.33]Start it over, start it over, start it over.
[317:22.59]So is it bath time?
[317:27.62]Start it over.
[317:28.28]Three minutes starting now.
[317:29.44]Go!
[317:29.52]Now.
[318:04.42]When my mind's allowed to wander!
[318:06.96]I need like some- I need sound.
[318:08.74]I need noise.
[318:09.66]I need somebody talking.
[318:11.80]I can't fucking do it.
[318:13.04]I can't do it.
[318:13.66]I don't think I can.
[318:14.86]There's your one, your two, your three, whatever it is.
[318:17.30]I don't think I can do it.
[318:18.62]Do math.
[318:21.57]I keep thinking of fucking bath now.
[318:23.21]Somebody said bath time with Jeremy.
[318:25.67]Fuck.
[318:28.77]Just listen to a TED talk.
[318:30.47]Is that like a loud- is that loud?
[318:31.69]Can I listen to a TED talk?
[318:34.19]TED Talk.
[318:35.51]Science.
[318:36.01]I don't know.
[318:36.41]This is quantum physics.
[318:42.26]Quantum physics.
[319:03.91]When it starts, in three, two, one.
[319:20.69]So have you ever had this experience?
[319:23.57]Starting now.
[319:23.96]You're having a chat with someone, and they're telling you something about a subject they're very interested in or they know a lot about.
[319:32.42]And you're following along and then at some stage you realize you kind of lost the thread of what they're saying.
[319:38.90]And then you're standing there and you realize you've got absolutely no idea what they're talking about.
[319:42.96]I had this recently with a friend who knows a lot about investing.
[319:49.68]No!
[319:50.08]Because I just saw me in the fucking reflector watching TV this way.
[319:55.01]Like I'm watching TV on stream.
[320:03.53]And the TV's off camera over here.
[320:05.67]No, it can't be somebody talk- I got it.
[320:07.51]I know it'll- I know what to do.
[320:14.67]Um... How long is it?
[320:26.10]Okay.
[320:28.76]The national anthem is five minutes long.
[320:30.22]Here we go.
[320:35.48]United States of America National Anthem.
[320:43.35]Um... No, uh, how about, um... Zoo, a zoo, uh... I don't know, what... TV static, no.
[321:00.40]Why would Beach, why would I not be able to do Beach, for fuck's sake?
[321:08.02]Seagull sounds.
[321:09.84]That actually would be... Okay, this has to be the one.
[321:13.23]If I don't do it here, then I'm turning the stream off.
[321:16.17]I'm out of here.
[321:17.27]I've got to go dunk my head in water.
[321:39.80]It's plugged in just to make sure everyone sees it.
[321:41.56]It's plugged in.
[321:44.95]Okay.
[321:50.90]Starting now.
[329:02.09]This is the last time I'm ever gonna play this game.
[329:08.97]No, I am so zen.
[329:10.38]I'm completely zen.
[329:11.28]So we need to have zen background.
[329:18.04]This is six hours of zen.
[329:22.90]Nice.
[329:25.70]Nice.
[329:27.76]No, no, no Katamari.
[329:32.64]There we go.
[329:35.77]Feels pretty good.
[329:38.29]Alright, so I need now... I have 25 experience points.
[329:41.65]We're going to do plus one energy speed.
[329:44.35]There we go.
[329:46.67]Get a couple more of these too.
[329:47.85]Why not?
[329:49.66]That's for going very fast.
[329:53.82]I don't think it's possible to fight the boss.
[329:56.88]Not yet, at least.
[329:59.39]Maybe in a few moments.
[330:01.93]It's possible.
[330:07.87]Monty Pit has 26 minutes.
[330:09.40]We will see that again.
[330:10.86]At least one more time.
[330:14.46]This guy no longer laughs.
[330:19.92]Let's test it.
[330:21.79]Let's see if I've actually achieved true focus.
[330:32.11]Here we go.
[330:45.78]I've achieved it.
[330:51.10]That would have... The un-ascended me would have laughed at that last one because it was so abrupt.
[330:59.36]And now I need screaming.
[331:05.55]Okay.
[331:12.33]Let's try.
[331:18.48]No.
[331:22.84]It's not going to do anything.
[331:26.49]That was close.
[331:27.57]That was very close, but I've ascended.
[331:29.23]Yeah.
[331:35.28]That would've- that would've done it.
[331:43.39]Alright, I'm done.
[331:45.15]Let's just play the game.
[331:49.65]There's only so many to- OH SHIT I'M GOING TOO FAST
[332:03.60]It was the three.
[332:04.44]It was the... It was the third.
[332:08.51]Just the same person.
[332:12.23]Alright, that's it.
[332:12.99]I'm ready.
[332:14.30]I need music, though.
[332:15.20]What the fuck am I doing?
[332:30.06]Okay, so let's go back here.
[332:33.14]Let's just do it now.
[332:33.88]I'm not waiting 15 more minutes for this shit.
[332:37.87]Toughness.
[332:38.25]What do we got?
[332:40.15]I can do a bunch into the cube.
[332:41.45]And now that puts it at 13.
[332:49.53]Maxed out.
[332:50.11]Combine all this shit.
[333:01.67]Cube.
[333:02.27]All the cubes.
[333:02.83]Let's put them together.
[333:07.24]Special, right?
[333:08.92]Wait a minute.
[333:11.82]You... What did that say?
[333:13.60]That said something.
[333:15.14]Dragon.
[333:15.82]What did that say?
[333:16.58]That said I have a new cube.
[333:21.16]Infinity cube.
[333:33.69]You should probably boost your equipment first before boosting the cube.
[333:47.74]What should I eat?
[333:48.94]You guys have any ideas what I should have for food?
[333:55.20]I need some good food ideas.
[333:58.21]Chicken sandwich?
[334:00.57]Maybe.
[334:08.49]Alright, let's ascend.
[334:11.77]This is gonna be a big, big fucking deal.
[334:14.57]450 million.
[334:18.84]Get a Poke Bowl.
[334:22.16]I'm actually not a big fan of raw tuna.
[334:25.78]Not really.
[334:27.36]It's alright.
[334:28.40]I'd rather have it as a spicy tuna roll.
[334:38.74]A poke bowl.
[334:42.54]But, I like spicy tuna, but I don't like it... I don't... You know how people get the big, red, fatty tuna?
[334:47.82]Like, sushi?
[334:50.60]Should I just wait the... No.
[334:51.76]Rebirth.
[334:52.12]Let's do it.
[334:55.01]Boom.
[334:56.91]This is now gonna be ridiculous.
[334:58.87]Like, absolutely ridiculous.
[335:02.47]Microwave some cereal.
[335:05.09]trying to gross me out okay uh rebirth 450 million now we can I I could nuke I don't have any I don't have any points let's do just why is that taking so long alright okay we're already at eight trillion attack just in case anyone was curious
[335:32.49]Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[335:34.61]I don't want to nuke.
[335:35.29]I like to see how far we go.
[335:38.18]So we're at 20 trillion attack.
[335:41.48]He's got 120.
[335:42.02]We've got plenty.
[335:43.64]Just drain him down.
[335:46.68]I've got an image to look at.
[335:52.09]I'll never look at that one again.
[335:54.79]Thank you, though.
[335:58.11]Adventure.
[335:58.91]I'm going to get very close to being able to do this shit.
[336:04.07]What else has special?
[336:05.11]This does.
[336:08.00]I got the money pit back fight boss.
[336:13.48]Cap is going up.

[336:37.35]Jerma idol.
[336:38.85]Tomorrow is possible that it'll be the community night.
[336:41.30]You'll find out very soon.
[336:43.96]Tomorrow, I'll be here tomorrow morning, early kind of afternoon-ish, early morning-ish, to tell you what, if there's enough.
[336:51.16]If there's enough, we're going to do the community night.
[336:52.56]And what is the community night?
[336:53.51]The community night is the new monthly or bi-monthly
[336:59.31]stream where we hang out for a few hours and we go over a bunch of community artwork a bunch of community videos a bunch of anything that's just original community content it doesn't just have to be art it's not necessarily an artwork showcase it's an everything showcase and we just chill and maybe I'll do a coloring book maybe I'll do a coloring book on stream
[337:31.18]what is cracked up movie night yeah kind of is it's kind of a movie night if there was a police officer that wanted to guaranteed right like
[337:58.04]50 tickets a day?
[338:00.04]And we're talking absolute guarantee.
[338:03.03]Hang out over there.
[338:13.43]Oh, I need music.
[338:19.32]What else we got?
[338:19.72]I'm just going to go next, next, next on Lego Island until there's something else.
[338:23.42]Next, next, next, next, next, next, next.
[338:28.78]Okay, I guess this is also LEGO-related.
[338:37.10]This is called the Catchy Song.
[339:05.58]No, no, no, excuse me, I'm sorry.
[339:12.44]I call bullshit on that one because here's the original.
[339:20.75]Got that instantly.
[339:39.52]Don't she come over here and she's like, oh, stop this nonsense!
[339:43.97]That's enough!
[339:44.59]Enough with that song, please!
[339:46.61]No more!
[339:47.33]No more of this song!
[339:49.37]Nothing in here!
[339:50.63]Let's prove it!
[339:51.84]There ain't fucking anything in here!
[339:56.10]Turn off that song!
[340:00.26]Some people started singing it, not knowing what it was.
[340:04.74]But we'll continue singing it forever.
[340:08.24]Because the song that does it ends.
[340:11.86]Get the fuck out of here.
[340:14.26]I'm done with that.
[340:28.15]This is a great cup, though, I will say.
[340:33.51]You know how people do, like, oh, I'm gonna watch this video for an hour, or the 10-hour version, or whatever.
[340:37.71]You've never seen anybody watch that one.
[340:40.86]Maybe you have.
[340:42.04]Is that, like, a subset of YouTube or Twitch or something that I don't know about?
[340:48.86]Alright, I got a lot of them.
[340:49.66]Let's do this.
[340:51.58]Gorgonzola.
[340:52.42]Wait a minute.
[340:53.59]This is 18.
[340:54.03]I just, I did it!
[340:54.99]I got to 18!
[340:57.60]Augmentation feature unlocked.
[340:59.18]Go check it out in the features.
[341:00.43]A new adventure zone has also been unlocked, the forest.
[341:03.35]Exhausted, bruised, and slightly deaf from explosion, you hobble into this mysterious hut.
[341:08.13]And indeed, this seems to be the home of the wizard.
[341:11.67]Whoever he is.
[341:12.94]You see the stereotypical bubbling cauldron, various gross magical ingredients, and oddly enough, dozens of empty cans of compressed air laying on the floor.
[341:23.95]like wait why uh okay uh however the bug-eyed wizard has caught your attention as he whoops maniacally greeting you like an old friend with your memory loss you just take him at his word that you knew each other
[341:44.87]He claims he can help you if you'd head through what he calls the hazy cave just behind his home and gather some of that good stuff.
[341:52.87]Whatever that is.
[341:54.32]Feeling unusually merciful, you agree to help and set off into the cave.
[341:58.04]Be prepared for anything that's in the cave there, fella.
[342:01.24]The weird gases in there make you go a little loopy.
[342:05.32]And if you need a little something something to get stronger, see Mr. Jensen just a couple houses down.
[342:09.64]He'll hook you up with some of what he calls augmentations.
[342:13.35]It's weird sci-fi mumbo-jumbo, but I can't deny that it works.
[342:17.25]Augmentation.
[342:23.27]Unlock by defeating Gorgon.
[342:26.13]Next augment.
[342:26.73]So this is a gold sink.
[342:30.37]Base stat multiplier 1.
[342:36.03]Wait, energy allocated?
[342:37.13]What?
[342:37.39]What?
[342:44.49]Really?
[342:44.79]Let's get that up.
[342:56.72]Well, that's only halfway there.
[342:59.98]You use energy to build it up and it adds a multiplier.
[343:02.42]That's cool.
[343:04.51]This is a fun game.
[343:08.77]Let's pull this down now.
[343:15.82]Okay, I gotta do increments of like 200 now, or 100 at least.
[343:25.17]Alright, we're at 3,000.
[343:25.97]What's my actual cap now?
[343:27.67]3,757.
[343:27.85]That's pretty good.
[343:30.23]That doubles attack and defense.
[343:31.83]I have, speaking of attack and defense, quadrillion.
[343:35.29]Almost not, oh, 8 quadrillion.
[343:37.78]So I can do damage.
[343:40.92]I'm about to kill Gorgonzola right now, and I'm gonna get the artifact.
[343:45.61]You're having more fun with this clicking game than with the lava game.
[343:49.11]I feel like we're going to pass the point of no return with this one.
[343:55.57]And, I mean, I'm only going to be streaming for like, I don't know.
[344:00.17]I did it.
[344:01.39]Yes, you're fighting sentient cheeses now.
[344:03.91]Yes, it's probably the gas.
[344:05.33]No, you should not let this cheese or anything else in this cave live.
[344:09.27]This one is armed with a massive crossbow.
[344:11.41]How is it even able to fire the damn thing?
[344:13.83]I don't know.
[344:15.03]But,
[344:16.55]I just got safety scissors.
[344:20.95]Time left to complete the augment.
[344:24.77]Oh... I get it.
[344:30.47]Eleven minutes.
[344:33.85]Shit.
[344:34.37]Okay.
[344:35.51]Um... I have to build them.
[344:38.53]Let's go into the sewers, though, because I... Uh, I don't want to listen to that, but that's fine.
[344:46.99]I need gold, need gold, need gold.
[344:48.64]Why am I not getting gold?
[344:49.40]Because I'm not doing adventuring.
[344:50.54]That's why.
[344:56.84]That's what's going on here.
[345:00.50]Is this an ad or is this the actual... No, this is the actual thing.
[345:03.08]Okay.
[345:04.82]So let's go to adventure.
[345:05.81]I'm in the forest.
[345:07.39]These things are way too powerful.
[345:10.45]I don't think I can do the forest.
[345:14.43]This is going to be tricky.
[345:18.91]I might get something good for this, though.
[345:19.95]Let's see.
[345:22.05]3,900 gold.
[345:22.43]You've defeated a goblin.
[345:25.51]33, 44.
[345:26.31]I mean, I need more max HP.
[345:28.06]Bad.
[345:34.32]Fairy has defeated you.
[345:35.80]Right.
[345:38.83]How am I doing on this fight?
[345:40.85]11 and 13.
[345:42.85]Not really enough.
[345:49.87]Let's go all the way.
[345:51.61]Cap that shit up.
[345:54.23]Alright.
[345:54.91]10k levels in previous attack.
[345:57.05]Which that's not going to happen anytime soon.
[345:58.38]I'm just going to put it into here.
[346:00.92]What's the point?
[346:01.48]Alright.
[346:04.70]Looks good.
[346:08.92]So, 11.
[346:10.10]I need 10,000 gold.
[346:12.76]Which I almost have.
[346:13.82]Adventure.
[346:14.20]Let's try it again.
[346:15.68]Forest.
[346:15.96]Forest.
[346:21.06]Good.
[346:21.32]This should be easy.
[346:22.98]A lot of HP, though.
[346:24.72]Orc!
[346:31.88]Is that a Mario Yahtzee in the background?
[346:33.76]The Orc dropped a toughness boost, too.
[346:42.56]And 4300 gold.
[346:45.00]Toughness bo- wait.
[346:46.96]Is it working?
[346:53.75]Didn't I have money?
[346:57.15]I thought... Z. Bonus 2 bonus.
[347:03.37]Oh, shit.
[347:03.81]Okay.
[347:06.79]Max health, toughness.
[347:07.85]None of these needed.
[347:09.86]Toughness 2.
[347:10.30]There we go.
[347:13.56]In the boots.
[347:15.98]Let's get back to the adventure.
[347:16.86]Did I die?
[347:17.32]No, I'm good.
[347:18.24]I need 10 grand?
[347:29.42]10 grand.
[347:34.55]Here we go.
[347:35.73]Augmentation.
[347:37.85]10,000 gold.
[347:38.61]Time left to complete.
[347:39.75]10 minutes.
[347:40.99]Let's get some... No, let's make that easier.
[347:45.13]I don't want to wait around 10 minutes.
[347:46.27]Are you kidding me?
[347:51.02]3 minutes.
[347:56.50]Alright.
[347:58.56]39 quadrillion.
[348:01.21]Uh-oh.
[348:01.95]I don't really have enough.
[348:03.73]What do I get for rebirth?
[348:05.55]This is going up like crazy.
[348:06.61]Alright, at 15 minutes this is going to be insane.
[348:13.99]Get milk infusion.
[348:15.51]Base stat multiplier 25.
[348:18.72]Marinating your bones in milk for 6 hours should toughen them up.
[348:21.34]200,000 gold.
[348:27.63]Is that 22 hours or 22 minutes?
[348:34.90]22 minutes.
[348:35.50]Good.
[348:36.02]Okay.
[348:37.92]Experience.
[348:39.76]I'm gonna wait for... I wanna do this.
[348:42.20]I'll do it right now.
[348:47.04]No money pit.
[348:47.84]Not worth it.
[348:48.26]22 minutes if you use all of your energy.
[348:56.14]Okay.
[348:58.56]Jeremy, stop.
[348:59.16]You need to stop playing this game.
[349:01.03]Only tonight.
[349:03.37]And maybe leave my computer on overnight and just play this and just not stream it, but try to get to the vacation.
[349:19.81]Jeremy, please.
[349:21.25]Please, Jeremy, please.
[349:24.59]Well, you're fine.
[349:25.29]We're fine.
[349:30.96]Inventory.
[349:35.12]Alright.
[349:43.19]Can I combine this?
[349:44.67]No.
[349:45.03]That's 20 attack power.
[349:47.95]So this thing is junk now.
[349:49.81]Get rid of it.
[349:50.93]It's a wooden sword.
[349:52.63]This is junk too.
[349:53.45]Get rid of this too.
[349:55.33]I'm never gonna put this on.
[350:01.57]Alright, now I can do adventure.
[350:03.13]Let's see.
[350:04.15]Forest.
[350:04.63]I should be doing much more damage now.
[350:10.86]It's funny because Link doesn't talk.
[350:18.14]RIP 100 set bonus.
[350:23.14]What do you mean 100 set bonus?
[350:26.44]3800 gold.
[350:26.92]What about my augmentation?
[350:27.94]Almost there.
[350:28.34]41 seconds.
[350:35.83]This stream is the longest worst joke of 2019.
[350:37.68]This is not a joke to me.
[350:47.90]This is a game I'm playing.
[350:53.48]This is my- I wanna play this game.
[350:58.91]Not everything's gotta be a joke!
[351:03.03]You understand?
[351:05.66]Here, just take that last bit.
[351:07.44]Just take that last little bit.
[351:08.50]Sip it.
[351:08.84]Come on.
[351:09.75]Get it.
[351:11.57]Nice.
[351:13.41]Wow, you got it.
[351:13.99]Nice work.
[351:17.21]Why am I doing that?
[351:20.63]I didn't spill it.
[351:21.29]There's no... I don't got anything.
[351:24.85]I got a safety scissor.
[351:25.99]Sick.
[351:31.21]So my stats- 43 Gua- oh, holy shit, hold on.
[351:35.48]Well, alright, well now you die.
[351:40.41]You put creamer in your coffee.
[351:42.75]It depends on what kind of coffee it is.
[351:43.91]Iced coffee, I do usually do almond milk.
[351:54.95]Alright, I got the Brie.
[351:56.65]This cheese is named after a city in the Netherlands.
[351:58.39]Knowing that, this is going to be a tough fight.
[352:00.15]1.9 quintillion.
[352:02.35]Quintillion.
[352:05.54]Yeah, it's absolutely double the stats.
[352:09.46]That's fucking pretty good.
[352:11.38]How am I doing in adventure mode?
[352:12.28]What do we got?
[352:12.64]Anything else?
[352:13.28]Just a 1?
[352:14.16]Put it in here.
[352:18.76]51 power now.
[352:22.57]Sextillion incoming.
[352:23.87]Yeah.

[352:31.84]Like, why would I not?
[352:35.24]And then when we... When we... And then the stream ends.
[352:39.96]I think so.
[352:40.70]That sounds like a plan to me.

[352:44.02]Yeah, sextillion.
[352:44.72]It's... You don't know what sextillion?

[353:08.20]Do I have an issue?
[353:09.05]I don't think I do.

[357:26.87]You know, I'll tell you something.
[357:28.19]I had a blast on today's stream.
[357:31.52]I had a fucking great time.
[357:32.96]This was a lot of fun.
[357:35.60]Sometimes it don't matter what the game is.
[357:38.76]We make our own damn fun.
[357:44.41]I'm glad somebody did.
[357:47.51]Easy.
[357:47.89]Easy.
[357:48.93]Easy.
[358:00.51]I'm admitting this is a bad stream.
[358:02.37]What?
[358:02.53]What are you talking about?
[358:05.24]This is like the... I had... I've had like the... I had... I played Hitman yesterday and had a different kind of fun.
[358:12.02]I had a lot of fun today.
[358:12.94]What are you talking about?
[358:14.16]It's got a pants blast.
[358:22.03]It is a fucking mess.
[358:25.11]So I've got to go.
[358:32.27]I've never heard that term before.
[358:33.63]It's a pants blast.
[358:36.27]You guys are sick.
[358:37.36]Look at that.
[358:51.08]It's like lightning.
[358:57.78]Oh, already at quadrillion.

[359:01.33]Skip it.
[359:02.39]Skip it.
[359:03.49]No, not this one.
[359:04.21]Alright, augmentation.
[359:06.05]I lost my augmentation, though.
[359:16.90]Yeah, this does hurt my eyes.
[359:21.69]I need full HP.
[359:22.93]Yeah, I also need to do this, too.
[359:26.37]I need just to get this.
[359:27.21]I need defense.
[359:32.55]Uh, adventuring is also important right now, too.
[359:35.33]Inventory?
[359:36.17]Nothing?
[359:37.53]What is... 10, 10... No, there's no reason for me to... Just get rid of this.
[359:42.27]I don't need to... Why do I need to hold on to this?
[359:50.65]Is it dark mode?
[359:59.63]Holy shit.
[360:03.11]You need to buy the ascended newbie pack in the sellout shop to turn this on.
[360:10.57]Oh, that's great.
[360:14.05]I said that four hours ago.
[360:15.27]It wasn't nighttime four hours ago.
[360:19.19]It was three o'clock pacific time.
[360:20.63]The sun was still shining.
[360:21.47]I don't need dark mode then.
[360:23.60]It's later now.
[360:31.84]Alright, now I can do this.
[360:36.07]It's 20,000 gold.
[360:37.05]Need more gold.
[360:37.91]How's adventuring doing?
[360:41.91]Gorgon.
[360:42.45]Boss.
[360:43.91]Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Kill it. Kill it.
[360:54.96]Nice.
[360:55.40]Did it.
[360:58.17]I need to beat level 37.
[360:58.95]Oh my god, that ain't gonna happen.
[361:03.41]Alright, almost there.
[361:03.95]Almost at 10,000.
[361:04.57]And then I'm just gonna spam.
[361:07.88]I'm gonna take all the points away from the training.
[361:11.90]Let's actually start doing this now.
[361:13.80]I'm gonna dump every single point into the augmentation.
[361:17.01]Every single one.
[361:19.31]It's 20,000 gold, right?
[361:19.67]1 minute 57 seconds.
[361:20.23]You got it.
[361:26.02]There is no... I cannot fight this.
[361:28.12]Okay, that's fine.
[361:32.49]Adventure.
[361:32.87]How's it going?
[361:33.39]Inventory.
[361:33.89]A couple of Zs.
[361:36.45]Nice.
[361:37.68]Special?
[361:38.44]Energy bonus.
[361:38.96]Let's do it.
[361:41.18]Set numbers to engineering.
[361:42.28]I'm not an engineer.
[361:42.92]I don't think I could figure it out.
[361:49.55]You can actually fight enemies if you do the... Yeah, if I do this, I can actually fight, but I can't because I don't have the thing unlocked.
[361:57.93]All I have is block unlocked right now.
[362:05.84]Alright, come on.
[362:06.46]Augmentation.
[362:06.94]Let's go.
[362:07.62]One minute.
[362:07.96]I need 10,000 gold, though.
[362:09.88]Okay.
[362:18.00]Kill it.
[362:18.62]Please.
[362:20.22]Rebirth is still doing fine.
[362:24.54]I mained Engi in TF2.
[362:25.72]Yeah, I did.
[362:28.14]I did.
[362:28.40]39.
[362:34.41]Okay, I got enough augmentation.
[362:36.13]Here it comes.
[362:38.67]26 seconds.
[362:41.99]Excuse me, kind sir.
[362:42.89]Could you please finish playing Fistbump from Sonic Forces?
[362:45.59]Yeah.
[363:00.00]There you go.
[363:07.58]Give me another one.
[363:11.70]How much money do I need?
[363:13.53]20,000 gold?
[363:13.75]Give me another one.
[363:28.93]Too loud?
[363:29.67]Not anymore.
[363:30.07]Alright, this is going to be a big hit here.
[363:36.93]11 million.
[363:41.15]Bree is going down.
[363:42.37]What's after that?
[363:44.29]Cheddar?
[363:46.57]One guy said it was too loud.
[363:47.64]I was the one guy.
[363:48.32]I thought it was too loud.
[363:50.82]Gouda!
[363:51.32]Fight it!
[363:52.42]No.
[363:52.94]No, I'm going to lose instantly.
[363:55.88]Augmentation.
[363:57.14]Here it comes.
[363:58.83]Another thing is Safety Scissors.
[364:02.19]Two minutes.
[364:07.66]I'm gonna hold on to my points now.
[364:14.18]Did I die?
[364:14.92]No.
[364:15.44]Inventory.
[364:16.34]Ooh, what's this?
[364:17.66]Mossy Ring.
[364:22.34]8, 24, 8.
[364:22.48]I'll have to combine them and add points to them.
[364:30.29]10, 30, 13.
[364:34.33]No.
[364:34.53]This is probably going to be better eventually, but not right now.
[364:40.81]Energy speed bonus.
[364:43.23]Yeah, but... This is regen and energy speed.
[364:48.47]Okay.
[364:50.81]I can't wait for those fucking buffalo wings.
[364:55.49]Hey.
[364:57.85]Thanks for fucking hanging out tonight.
[364:59.07]Can I just tell you... This song is making me feel positive.
[365:12.34]Alright, I need... What do I need to do?
[365:17.95]More, more, more.
[365:18.71]I want another one of these.
[365:21.93]Did I get killed?
[365:22.91]Giant has defeated you.
[365:23.83]I need 20 grand.
[365:27.71]Borg and boss.
[365:28.23]This is going to be a lot.
[365:28.87]Paralyze.
[365:29.31]Kill it.
[365:33.65]Hey.
[365:34.25]Yeah.
[365:34.77]Guys.
[365:34.95]Come on.
[365:35.55]You know what I'm saying?
[365:38.69]Fist bump.
[365:44.06]Too bad this Sonic game sucked.
[365:53.97]that Sonic game sucked there hasn't been a good Sonic the hedgehog game in probably about 12 years but uh hold on people are saying Sonic mania but Sonic mania is a compilation of all the other good ones
[366:20.08]Sonic Mania, Sonic Mania, they just like, they said, hey, Sonic the Hedgehog 1, 2, and 3 are great.
[366:24.30]Let's like kind of make that again and redo them all.
[366:27.21]What do you mean no, it's not?
[366:28.71]Do I have that wrong?
[366:34.09]What's the moment they just remade the first like three games and called it something else?
[366:44.91]They never did that.
[366:46.81]Generations, there it is.
[366:47.63]Okay, I was wrong.
[366:50.29]Sonic Mania.
[366:57.24]This is just Sonic the Hedgehog.
[366:59.22]They just remade it.
[367:01.42]Is this the same game?
[367:09.19]Is this a remake of the first one?
[367:15.67]Generations is that game it is this has new levels.
[367:19.17]So it's a new game with the old palette.
[367:21.29]Okay.
[367:22.61]Alright Okay, alright I was wrong that's fine.
[367:27.27]I was wrong.
[367:28.77]I was thinking of generations Okay, when do they come out 2016?
[367:32.17]Alright.
[367:32.69]Okay.
[367:33.47]Alright.
[367:34.08]Okay.
[367:36.06]Yep.
[367:36.98]Okay.
[367:37.48]Okay.
[367:37.68]Yeah.
[367:38.20]Yeah.
[367:38.52]Okay.
[367:38.92]Yep I'm corrected.
[367:39.96]That's fine.
[367:40.84]Okay
[367:45.27]I got two of these now?
[367:46.01]Good.
[367:48.93]That's all I want.
[367:49.49]Uh, alright.
[367:55.99]Boss time.
[367:57.47]Basic training.
[367:58.19]Let's get it in there.
[368:00.87]Tap it.
[368:01.28]Look at this.
[368:04.96]They're not even flashing anymore.
[368:15.07]They should make another classic Sonic game.
[368:19.63]I don't know what they should do with Sonic.
[368:24.01]Because Sonic sort of has an unfair... An unfair weight put on them, I think, for some reason.
[368:32.96]And I'll give you an example.
[368:35.26]So Mario, when they make a Mario game...
[368:38.91]It's still like Super Mario.
[368:40.69]It's still, you know, like a... Most of them... Almost all of them are platformers, right?
[368:44.91]So... If you make a Mario game, you make 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Mario games, and I'm talking the last 10 years, that are essentially jump from spot to spot, right?
[368:55.52]Sonic the Hedgehog is just I go very fast.
[368:58.22]But I go very fast has not stood the test of time that jump from spot to spot has.
[369:06.00]So what... It's kind of...
[369:09.88]How do you go really fast in 2020?
[369:18.18]You kind of can.
[369:19.72]Unless it's a racing game.
[369:22.64]They could have taken Sonic and made it its own Mario Kart type game.
[369:31.83]I know they did.
[369:32.51]They did Sonic races.
[369:33.45]But I'm talking like completely transitioned the whole entire character into this is a racing game.
[369:41.10]Not like, oh, let's go back and do Sonic Unleashed!
[369:44.24]Sonic Colors!
[369:45.40]Sonic, we go fast this way!
[369:47.65]No, just have it be your race.
[369:49.29]It's a race.
[369:50.77]Have it be like that Don't Touch the Floor Lava game, except it's Sonic the Hedgehog, and you gotta move fast and bunny hop and put it on PC and stuff.
[369:57.51]I don't know.
[370:01.19]I do, I remember Colors wasn't really not that bad, though.
[370:06.60]Because Mario has a bunch of these gimmicks, right?
[370:09.72]But they work.
[370:11.09]Gravity.
[370:12.19]Big gimmick, right?
[370:13.49]Mario Galaxy.
[370:15.91]You jump from the planets, you run around in a circle, it's like a gravity, okay?
[370:19.25]That's cool.
[370:19.79]It worked.
[370:20.33]Because you jump around.
[370:21.31]And gravity works when you jump.
[370:22.63]You land back on the ground.
[370:24.81]In Sonic Unleashed, their Mario Galaxy type scenario was turn into a werewolf.
[370:31.30]That does not add anything to going fast.
[370:37.48]In fact, a werewolf is slow.
[370:40.62]They're not that fast.
[370:41.32]If you've seen Twilight, the vampires run much faster than the werewolves because they have, like, the super-duper lightning, like, super speed.
[370:47.93]So... And then, didn't they, they did a, they did, like, he did, they gave him, like, a sword and a shield in one of them.
[370:55.77]He had, like, a fucking, he was like a knight.
[370:58.05]Right?
[371:00.96]That does not make going fast more interesting.
[371:05.76]Mario, um, Mario Galaxy, right?
[371:08.96]Mario Odyssey.
[371:09.80]Right?
[371:10.68]Mario Odyssey.
[371:11.34]They gave him this hat.
[371:12.78]The gimmick.
[371:13.54]You could throw the hat on stuff and control it.
[371:15.72]And it was interesting.
[371:17.71]It added way more dynamic to jumping up and down on stuff.
[371:23.43]They should have just given Sonic a fucking car.
[371:27.61]Just give him a car and just make a taxi game or something.
[371:30.10]I don't know.
[371:32.74]They did, but I mean in every game.
[371:34.88]You know when Mario picks up the fire plant and you can shoot fire out of his hands and that's the gimmick?
[371:41.29]Have there be a thing that you pick up and Sonic goes in the car and it's a super cool Batmobile type car and it goes like 500 miles per hour and you do the level in the car.
[371:51.64]Anything that goes really fast, like a train.
[371:53.42]Have him turn into a train.
[371:54.88]Or have him get in a train and go really fast in a train.
[371:57.02]Have him get in, you know, he can fly, he turns into a helicopter, I don't know.
[372:00.26]What things go really fucking fast?
[372:03.17]You don't slow them down, you make them go faster.
[372:04.93]That sounds awful.
[372:37.94]But still Mario has gimmicks that quantum that that they they add to Him jumping up and down Sonic keeps taking things away from how fast he goes Have a time travel have a Sonic the fucking Hedgehog time travel game where he goes too fast in the beginning of opening cutscene He goes way too fast and he goes like 200 years in the future or something.
[372:59.34]I
[373:01.31]They did that.
[373:08.00]Oh.
[373:08.14]My album goes so fast that it goes back in time!
[373:12.20]Has it gone back in time?
[373:13.86]Oh, they've done all options then.
[373:17.22]You time travel going fast, or... That's pretty much the only gimmick you can do.
[373:21.25]Okay, they did it.
[373:22.43]What was the game?
[373:23.63]What was it rated?
[373:25.91]Sonic CD.
[373:28.41]Generations and CD.
[373:33.60]Or I got a better idea, SEGA.
[373:35.54]Make another Super Monkey Ball game.
[373:40.70]And add Sonic as a fucking collectible character.
[373:43.33]He moves fast in that thing.
[373:45.17]They are.
[373:45.93]Okay, they're doing that too.
[373:47.25]They're on the right track.
[373:48.55]They're on the right track.
[373:50.25]Good.
[373:50.79]Here's Sonic and the Black Knight, exactly what we were just talking about.
[373:53.48]This is called Night of the Wind.
[374:02.85]Not bad.
[374:03.39]Alright.
[374:04.45]Blue cheese.
[374:06.07]Did you know that this stuff has mold in it?
[374:08.11]Gross.
[374:12.60]I love blue cheese, and I'm gonna have a shitload of it in like 20 minutes.
[374:17.52]Alright, what do I need?
[374:18.08]What do I got?
[374:18.84]Capped out here.
[374:19.42]39.9.
[374:21.30]Augmentation.
[374:22.62]What do I need for milk?
[374:24.54]Let's make some milk.
[374:27.88]I need 200,000 gold.
[374:29.88]Back to adventure mode.
[374:32.25]Buffalo wings and blue cheese.
[374:33.45]Oh, yeah.
[374:35.67]You have no idea.
[374:36.57]I'm going to eat too many of those tonight.
[374:37.91]I'm going to have so many.
[374:38.95]It's going to be ridiculous.
[374:43.04]Ooh.
[374:46.78]Energy.
[374:47.16]Yeah.
[374:47.64]I'm going to have the whole outfit on.
[374:49.02]Forest helmet.
[374:54.27]Power.
[374:56.83]So this is... Alright, these are not trash.
[375:01.68]Toughness 47.
[375:02.00]Let's take a look.
[375:03.32]Adventure.
[375:07.40]You making me hungry?
[375:09.64]I'm making myself hungry.
[375:14.27]What if Sonic went to the Olympics?
[375:16.27]Yes, that would be interesting, wouldn't it?
[375:22.79]Or... What if they just took away the whole Sonic goes really fast?
[375:29.57]Because you always have to worry about the fact that at some point during the game, when you're walking around, you're going to just start going 500 miles per hour.
[375:37.95]What if he gets cursed at the beginning of one of the games by Dr. Robotnik, throws like a curse at him, and he's, oh, I can't run fast anymore, and now you just have to play a different game.
[375:50.78]That's what they did.
[375:51.70]They did that already.
[375:53.27]Why is Sonic The Simpsons?
[375:55.77]Have they done everything?
[375:56.41]Have they tried everything?
[376:05.47]Those are games they've already made.
[376:13.20]Well, give them a fucking TV show and a CG movie.
[376:19.24]That's the final step there.
[376:21.12]Don't make any more games.
[376:22.40]Just turn it into a Cartoon Network show.
[376:26.09]I know about the... Yes, the movie.
[376:27.41]Yes, I know.
[376:28.49]The movie.
[376:28.87]I know about the movie.
[376:29.65]That's why I said the movie.
[376:34.70]And no, the TV show, yes.
[376:36.54]I know that show.
[376:37.12]Yes, I know.
[376:38.78]That's the end.
[376:39.58]That's the end game.
[376:40.38]That's how you end it.
[376:42.12]And then that's going to run for like fucking 35 seasons.
[376:45.44]And then SEGA is going to, they went from making hardware consoles to, we don't make consoles anymore, to now we make games only, but now we don't make games anymore.
[376:55.82]Now we just make TV shows.
[376:58.29]And they're going to just make cartoons in 20 years.
[377:14.07]Sonic Soulsborne.
[377:17.93]Might be interesting.
[377:19.37]You move really fast.
[377:24.20]That might be their plan.
[377:27.72]SEGA does have a lot of great properties, though.
[377:37.98]What's SEGA's number?
[377:39.09]Besides Sonic, SEGA has... House of the Dead.
[377:43.73]Um... Sonic.
[377:47.79]Yakuza.
[377:50.87]Okay, what... What else?
[377:54.37]I'm talking, like, relevant series.
[377:56.30]Like, they've had something come out in the last few years.
[378:01.24]Monkey Ball.
[378:01.88]But Monkey Ball, well, technically, they're making one, right?
[378:04.68]Parmesan.
[378:04.96]Parmesan.
[378:08.43]You're seriously debating taking this cheese's future corpse with you to grate over some pasta.
[378:12.93]That sounds good, too.
[378:14.51]I blame the game because of all the food shit.
[378:20.11]And, important to note here, very, very quickly, SEGA has been getting into the slot machine business.
[378:29.31]Because there is a House of the Dead slot machine now.
[378:40.83]They're... They're gonna be making cartoons and slot machines.
[378:46.61]Like Konami.
[378:52.45]Just wait until... Just wait until Nintendo caves somehow.
[378:57.20]They cave to the mobile market.
[378:59.56]When is the first Super Mario slot machine gonna be in Las Vegas?
[379:03.86]Oh boy, people, you won't be able to get anybody off that machine.
[379:08.20]Uh-oh.
[379:12.72]Yeah.
[379:16.34]What's wrong with the mobile market?
[379:18.10]Nothing.
[379:19.60]Except it's $7 for 10 gems in the Mario Kart mobile game.
[379:36.89]Of course I checked, because I played it for like an hour!
[379:40.92]Mario Kart releases on the iPad.
[379:42.70]Guys, I'm on my iPad every night.
[379:48.16]How long is this song?
[379:50.48]I'm done with it.
[379:55.36]Actual Boomer.
[379:56.64]You guys all have to...
[380:03.30]I ain't gonna take, I ain't gonna take this type of, I'm not gonna take this type of abuse about I don't boomer with an iPad in bed when I guarantee you at least 60 to 70% of everybody in this chat room has like a 10 inch like Galaxy Note 10.
[380:19.97]They're like this all day.
[380:25.53]How many of you guys have an iPhone?
[380:27.71]And how often are you like,
[380:33.74]Dermot, you're getting nerd neck.
[380:34.86]Thank you for reminding me.
[380:43.62]No, for real.
[380:44.12]Thanks.
[380:44.42]That's a great reminder.
[380:46.02]Careful when you're sitting down.
[380:46.86]Don't give yourself nerd neck.
[380:47.70]Alright.
[380:48.00]2, 4, 6, 8.
[380:49.47]Augmentation.
[380:50.03]I got 100,000 gold.
[380:50.85]Oh, shit.
[381:01.67]100,000 gold.
[381:03.39]Wait a minute.
[381:04.09]Take this ball down.
[381:06.44]I use my iPad in bed.
[381:07.38]That's what they're for.
[381:08.12]Why does iPad mean boomer?
[381:12.98]Because I use an electronic device in bed?
[381:15.50]I just have a bigger screen.
[381:19.36]I would be doing it on my phone.
[381:24.49]This is literally in the recommended right here.
[381:27.61]This is on the playlist.
[381:33.90]Is this because I've listened to this on stream?
[381:38.32]It's because I've listened to this on stream.
[381:44.45]Why does this sound like shit?
[381:49.39]Crossword puzzles are the new hotness.
[381:51.25]Yeah, they probably are.
[381:52.23]I can see that.
[381:54.42]Alright, augmentation.
[381:56.34]I want this milk thing.
[382:01.35]How long is it gonna take?
[382:06.13]16 minutes.
[382:06.59]And 200,000 gold.
[382:07.17]Oh, shit.
[382:08.23]I gotta be live for 16 more minutes.
[382:14.93]This is not Ace Combat, but I wish it was.
[382:17.65]Have any video games released in the last, like, week or two that have been worth playing?
[382:21.85]I have Code Vein.
[382:28.54]People keep telling me that that's not very good.
[382:31.63]We'll have to figure that out on our own.
[382:43.33]Code Vein is so bad.
[382:45.23]Really?
[382:48.73]Planet Zoo.
[382:49.31]Yeah, Planet Zoo's in beta, though.
[382:51.71]I want to play it when it's actually out and released completely.
[382:58.97]Oh, this is good.
[382:59.67]This is a new 8.
[383:01.15]Oh yeah, put it on.
[383:08.59]Hold on, sorry, I'm going quiet.
[383:09.53]This is the best part.
[383:30.11]Play Uno.
[383:30.65]I don't even know how.
[383:37.94]No, that's it.
[383:39.20]That's the only thing I really wanted you to hear in this song.
[383:43.16]This song is seven minutes long, but that's like the 12 seconds that I like.
[383:48.08]If I've heard this, I've played this song off stream before and sat and watched.
[383:52.49]You know, if you go into YouTube analytics, you can see there's a line that shows you when people watched and rewound.
[383:58.19]And it'll show you the time that had the most retention.
[384:01.41]I alone have probably made that bar like 60% higher on this video because I've rewound this probably, I did this spot right there, like probably two to 3000 times.
[384:18.80]This part right here.
[384:26.17]I need 200k.
[384:36.57]Two to three thousand times, probably, because I think about it.
[384:39.41]If I do it, you guys don't realize, when you listen to a song, and not just with this song, but any song that you actually like, you would be surprised if you were being tracked
[384:51.50]Without you knowing.
[384:53.38]Like, you just bugged yourself, essentially, right?
[384:56.80]You'd be surprised at how many times you actually go back and listen to the same thing.
[385:01.00]Over and over again.
[385:02.37]Oh, yeah, I heard, I listened to that for a little while.
[385:04.07]You look over, it's been 27 minutes.
[385:06.33]And you've been on, like, the same song.
[385:15.03]Or did I just admit to you that I'm a psychopath?
[385:19.21]I'm not sure which one of those things it is.
[385:27.90]I don't know.
[385:30.01]Both.
[385:30.33]Just one more time.
[385:44.07]Just kidding.
[385:44.87]Alright.
[385:45.25]Augmentation.
[385:45.91]I almost have it.
[385:47.95]16 minutes.
[385:48.37]I need 200,000 gold.
[385:51.11]Almost there.
[385:52.15]I'm going to do something for 16 minutes before the stream ends.
[385:56.03]That's the final thing I'm doing.
[385:59.33]48 billion, pretty good.
[386:01.15]This is going to double here in a second.
[386:06.66]No good games until The Outer Worlds comes out.
[386:12.15]Yeah, I mean, what games have released?
[386:23.03]What about Greedfall?
[386:24.73]No, I thought about Greedfall.
[386:27.22]The problem with Greedfall is just it's going to be one of those scenarios that's going to bore the hell out of me.
[386:32.02]I know it is.
[386:34.60]I was thinking about it, but I just see myself sitting there for a couple hours and then...
[386:43.59]I just don't want to pick all the dialog options.
[386:46.31]It kind of looks like it's Mass Effect-y where you got like five minutes of combat and exploration and gameplay and then like 30 minutes of story and go talk to all the people in town.
[386:58.08]Is that accurate?
[387:09.22]Yes, okay.
[387:10.58]Yeah.
[387:11.24]It's just not... I know a lot of people like that stuff, and that's fine.
[387:14.50]That's cool.
[387:15.16]I'm not going to tell you that that's not a good game.
[387:19.14]It's just not usually what I find to be very interesting.
[387:25.55]I don't do... I'm not even talking on stream.
[387:28.15]Like, oh, no, let's do it off stream.
[387:29.43]But even off stream, it doesn't click with me, really, at all.
[387:37.01]You should play Dicey Dungeons.
[387:39.29]I've heard that was very good.
[387:43.07]You would not like Earthbound.
[387:44.17]Well, Earthbound's different because Earthbound is... That's like an RPG.
[387:49.89]It's like a turn-based RPG.
[387:53.00]And there's a lot of stuff going on in Earthbound.
[387:55.98]It's not really the same genre, even.
[388:00.42]Bookworm Adventures Deluxe.
[388:04.96]I haven't heard that in a long time.
[388:08.25]Maybe I'll do that tomorrow.
[388:09.94]That's a lie, by the way.
[388:11.18]That's a confirmed 23 and a half hours from now lie.
[388:15.06]Alright.
[388:15.74]15 minutes and then I get this insane multiplier.
[388:21.92]Still can't do it.
[388:23.57]Although I might just... Yeah.
[388:25.45]Okay.
[388:25.83]Alright.
[388:27.11]It's been six and a half hours.
[388:29.21]Okay.
[388:29.37]Alright.
[388:35.69]Alright.
[388:44.47]Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
[388:52.09]That's the only thing I wanted to hear.
[388:53.29]Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
[388:55.91]This has been NGU Idol.
[388:59.89]And I forgot that I played Hot Lava for like an hour and a half.
[389:03.89]Two hours.
[389:06.37]The stream kind of just melted for me.
[389:08.75]It's six and a half hours.
[389:10.01]That's...
[389:14.13]Hope you guys had fun.
[389:15.79]Because I did.
[389:17.79]And it's just about having fun.
[389:19.51]You know?
[389:20.83]Maybe you didn't like NGU Ultimate, whatever it's called.
[389:24.28]What's it called?
[389:24.74]New Game Ultimate?
[389:29.20]Uh... Numbers Go Ultimate.
[389:32.23]Numbers Go Ultra.
[389:33.51]Numbers Go Up.
[389:36.39]I like the part where you did nothing.
[389:44.72]Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
[389:45.99]We are... It's kind of up in the air at this point what I'm going to do tomorrow.
[389:49.09]Because... As of... As of... Today, I'm not sure if there's enough to do a community stream.
[390:01.33]If there is, you will know.
[390:03.23]If there isn't, then I have a couple of things that I'd like to do tomorrow.
[390:09.38]No, it's not going to be an idle game.
[390:11.30]But sometimes I just want to sit here and talk to you.
[390:13.68]And hang out with you.
[390:16.00]Like I said, not every stream's got to be about fucking filling up your water.
[390:22.77]But, I'll see you tomorrow.
[390:25.39]That's not on here.
[390:26.23]Why?
[390:31.78]It worked!
[390:38.58]It worked!
[390:40.25]I did it!
[390:40.95]I figured it out!
[390:47.02]What an egoist.
[390:48.04]He has to be the one.
[390:48.80]I forgot I fucking did that.
[390:50.92]I looked at that right now.
[390:51.98]I'm just like, wait a minute.
[390:53.16]I did that.
[390:55.21]When did that happen?
[390:57.53]Holy shit.
[390:58.17]I did a hundred gifted subs.
[390:59.53]Okay, well.
[391:01.55]Thanks everybody for watching.
[391:03.59]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[391:07.19]I always just lose my bets.
[391:08.73]I'm never making a bet ever again unless I'm certain that it's winnable.
[391:14.74]You're drunk.
[391:17.05]Drunk on water and coffee, apparently.
[391:19.11]Okay.
[391:20.31]Well.
[391:23.39]Let's do the bits.
[391:24.35]Thanks, everybody.
[391:24.83]I'll see you tomorrow.
[391:27.97]Regardless of what we do.
[391:30.71]Much love to you.
[391:31.25]See you soon.
[391:34.51]Let's go back and do the bits.
[391:38.19]From earlier.
[391:40.45]Ow.
[391:45.79]Scroll, scroll, scroll.
[391:47.17]Here we are.
[391:49.93]So this is... We had... There was a lot of $50... 5,000-bit drops today.
[392:02.80]5,000 bits from Phylactery Lich, Lachronda, Benfold, Ball of Koala.
[392:09.90]Ball of Koala gave 5,000 bits too.
[392:11.16]Thank you.
[392:16.58]It was right off the bat.
[392:17.45]Right at the very beginning.
[392:24.45]Thank you, Jerma's Stinky Feet, for the 250 bits.
[392:26.83]Jerma just admitted that he poops so hard it displaces his intestines.
[392:32.20]I said that shit this long ago?
[392:39.24]Oh, we're talking about stretching.
[392:40.36]I got a lot of heat for that, by the way.
[392:43.17]Which, I don't think I deserved it.
[392:49.27]Yeah, I don't think I deserve that heat.
[392:52.35]I don't think so.
[392:52.89]Let's get some tunes on here.
[393:01.33]Put more stretches.
[393:02.33]Everybody's got to prep.
[393:03.11]That is really funny, though.
[393:04.21]It's one hour and 23 minutes.
[393:06.69]From computer turning on to like, okay, the stream is... It's open.
[393:13.20]Now I've got to go get ready.
[393:14.50]It's like an hour and 23 minutes.
[393:21.41]But thank you for the $2.50.
[393:22.70]Appreciate it.
[393:23.92]StixRenegade, thanks for the $2.50.
[393:25.46]Hey, Jeremy, here's another car update.
[393:28.10]I'm officially a degenerate.
[393:29.10]What are you... You're putting stuff all over the place.
[393:34.04]You keep, like... You keep putting stickers on your car.
[393:44.36]Thank you, though.
[393:44.90]I appreciate it.
[393:49.54]I'm going to go ahead and say that I don't want to show that part of your car on stream.
[393:53.72]So thank you, though.
[393:59.44]Appreciate it.
[394:08.81]Speaking of cars... There goes one.
[394:19.72]Imagine the person gifting 25 subs to get overshadowed by the streamer.
[394:24.66]It was HurricaneTurtle for 20, but yeah, I know what you mean.
[394:29.08]Enjoy those buffalo wings, you're welcome.
[394:30.96]I will.
[394:34.44]I've been in such a great mood lately.
[394:36.40]Have anybody else noticed that?
[394:39.00]Not that I'm ever in a bad mood.
[394:41.49]I think ever since like a week or two ago, I've just been in a great fucking mood.
[394:48.22]Buffalo wings tonight?
[394:49.99]Oh.
[394:51.21]Just being elevated.
[395:00.69]TwitchCon was great, too.
[395:01.50]It was awesome.
[395:02.92]You know what?
[395:03.64]I'm coming off of the TwitchCon high.
[395:07.76]It was just a really, really fun, wonderful time.
[395:16.07]But, thank you for the 250 sticks, Renegade.
[395:18.94]By the way, they say, also in reference to the ass wiping convo, I can wipe my ass in one minute.
[395:24.98]No, you can't.
[395:28.68]I can wipe my ass in one minute.
[395:30.33]100% clean.
[395:31.07]Then I shower to clean even further.
[395:32.89]Yes, every time.
[395:34.23]Well, that means that you weren't 100% clean.
[395:36.77]You wouldn't need to take a shower after you go to the bathroom if you were 100% clean.
[395:52.50]Oh, God.
[395:53.50]But thanks a lot.
[395:54.18]Appreciate it.
[395:55.21]Boneless bacon, thanks for the thousand bits.
[395:57.25]Jerma, you smell.
[395:57.99]Go take a shower.
[396:00.29]Not really.
[396:01.87]I don't think so.
[396:06.69]Just wear brown underwear, forehead.
[396:08.74]I have a poo-poo community, huh?
[396:17.46]Yeah, I have like a, I have like a shit.
[396:19.58]Let's, let's talk about like poop and shit and stuff community now, do I?
[396:24.17]We have to get rid of this.
[396:29.49]Is that, this has to get wiped up.
[396:31.19]And I'm talking about, we're talking from the top.
[396:33.27]Starting with me.
[396:34.27]I ain't gonna, we're not gonna talk about like diarrhea and stuff anymore.
[396:38.78]How am I ever gonna get those brand deals?
[396:53.53]Hey, thank you Bake Me Home for the 620 bits.
[396:56.03]Cheering from my new chat badge.
[396:57.71]Nice.
[396:58.63]Also, my Andy Mark goat arrived with bits of carnival dirt on it.
[397:03.03]Pretty authentic.
[397:04.11]Really?
[397:04.61]That's awesome.
[397:07.96]Are they still available?
[397:08.64]You might be able to still get it.
[397:11.04]With real carnival dirt.
[397:12.80]Because it probably hit the floor.
[397:14.74]So that's how you know it's real.
[397:19.42]Bought one last night.
[397:20.18]Nice.
[397:21.48]We got a link.
[397:22.38]Where's the link to the Andy Mark goat site?
[397:26.32]All these goats are authentic part of the carnival.
[397:31.16]With real dirt on them.
[397:39.60]But, yeah.
[397:40.36]Thanks for the 620 bits.
[397:42.90]Stay tuned.
[397:43.76]There's much more to see.
[397:45.00]Sooner than you think.
[397:50.54]Oh yeah.
[397:51.74]Uh, thank you to Das Knight for the thousand bits.
[397:58.60]Hell yeah.
[398:07.27]And your streams are the perfect thing to relax to and have fun with in these last years of school.
[398:12.55]You shouldn't be surprised to hear that whenever I've mentioned you to someone else, their first reaction is always, Oh yeah, that guy's great.
[398:19.61]Or, yeah, I love those videos.
[398:21.21]So keep up the good work, old chap.
[398:25.78]That makes me happy.
[398:31.98]I know we fuck around a lot.
[398:34.84]But,
[398:38.29]I'm glad that people think this is fun.
[398:41.92]I don't want you to not think it's fun.
[398:44.90]I don't want you to think this was... I would much rather prefer that people take something good from this.
[398:53.72]Not like, oh, positive.
[398:55.13]Only positive.
[398:55.89]Positive, positive, positive, positive.
[398:57.85]That's not really what I mean.
[398:58.83]I just mean... That no matter what happens on these streams, you can take something from it.
[399:13.19]I'm upcoming negative stream.
[399:14.93]Coming up soon.
[399:16.85]No.
[399:20.89]But anytime I hear something like that, that makes me want to do better.
[399:24.32]To be honest.
[399:30.20]Saying like, oh, that guy's great.
[399:31.30]I love those videos.
[399:32.18]I say, that's awesome.
[399:35.12]I should try harder now.
[399:36.10]I should do better.
[399:43.39]I really appreciate it.
[399:44.15]Thank you for the thousand bits.
[399:46.73]And good luck at university.
[399:50.73]Getting into your dream university.
[399:51.81]It's awesome.
[399:52.43]Glad to hear it.
[399:52.85]That was Das Knight.
[400:01.52]20 community subs from Paraguay, who was the dev of this game that we played.
[400:09.90]The game's free.
[400:12.92]If you want to do it yourself.
[400:15.83]This is not... This stream had nothing to... This is not an ad stream or a sponsor stream.
[400:22.88]I mean, it's free.
[400:23.56]If you want to try it, go for it.
[400:25.08]If not, then... Whatever.
[400:27.52]Who cares, right?
[400:31.96]It is now.
[400:34.67]No, it's just a fun little game.
[400:36.35]And I saw that I was like, let's try it.
[400:39.25]Best part about this is I'm getting rebirth time counting up.
[400:43.67]I'm not even playing.
[400:45.33]Sitting here in the outro.
[400:46.15]It's good stuff.
[400:51.13]You saw somebody with a glue man shirt on at your school.
[400:55.70]You should immediately befriend that person.
[401:04.30]But thank you to The Mox for the thousand bits.
[401:06.84]Hey, look, it's that guy I saw at the carnival.
[401:09.94]That's me.
[401:17.24]That's me.
[401:21.40]Smiley face.
[401:24.19]Thank you for the thousand bits.
[401:25.31]Appreciate it.
[401:26.87]Thank you, Gibbler, for the 500 bits.
[401:30.31]When will streamer close the menu and start the game?
[401:35.26]Hopefully I did it sooner than you thought.
[401:36.62]You've been playing it throughout the stream?
[401:39.78]Cool.
[401:46.96]The prestiging is fun.
[401:53.58]Paraguay came through with another six community subs right here.
[401:59.36]Well, not here, but, you know, a few hours ago.
[402:02.27]Thanks a lot.
[402:08.70]Also, Lunchmeat gave five community subs.
[402:10.80]I think we caught it, but still.
[402:12.87]SadVega, thanks for the 250.
[402:14.09]You bully listen to Kirby Superstar.
[402:16.87]It's much more soothing than this.
[402:19.35]Bully?
[402:20.77]I love Kirby.
[402:21.29]What are you talking about?
[402:24.11]StixRenegade, thanks for the 250.
[402:25.77]You lied about drawing me.
[402:27.29]You didn't draw me.
[402:28.27]It's been over a year.
[402:29.13]I don't know how to draw.
[402:38.36]You don't want that, Troy.
[402:42.78]Thank you.
[402:43.58]Sloppy Sloth, thanks for the five community subs.
[402:49.27]Thank you, Sad Vega for the 250.
[402:50.69]It's an image they say I have been doing.
[402:55.29]What are you saying?
[402:55.85]I've been... Is that about Cookie Clicker?
[402:59.48]Hold on, let me move this.
[403:02.09]He said, I've been doing a two grandma only non-world destroying cookie clicker run for two years now.
[403:10.10]I survived on two grandmas and auto clicks alone until I got to spaceships so I could send my cookies out into the universe.
[403:18.86]Then I added some luck fractals and java cookies.
[403:24.86]How long have you been doing this for?
[403:27.68]For two years.
[403:31.44]That's
[403:34.92]So that means you haven't cleared your browser cache in two years.
[403:41.58]You've not cleared your actual cookies in two years.
[403:44.02]Wow.
[403:49.98]You have 122 quintillion cookies in this image.
[403:54.14]I wonder how many trackers you have on your browser.
[403:57.22]Maybe more.
[404:03.78]Over two years.
[404:08.49]Only quintillions.
[404:09.61]Oh, mega lul.
[404:15.66]That takes a long time, though.
[404:16.84]Congratulations.
[404:23.91]Quack gave five community subs.
[404:25.33]Skater Kid gave 500 bits.
[404:26.77]Gentlemen, this is literally the first time I've ever spent money on a Twitch.
[404:33.77]On Twitch in four years I've been on here.
[404:36.59]I heard you on the official podcast today at work, and I really have a lot of respect for you as a content creator.
[404:40.99]Not everyone is as passionate as you are, and I hope this helps you keep up the amazing content.
[404:46.40]Whatever that may be, as long as it makes you happy, because I think that's what separates you from a lot of other people.
[404:51.38]Cheers.
[404:56.13]Thank you.
[404:58.65]Happy to be here.
[405:03.32]official, yeah, the critical official podcast.
[405:06.18]I was on it a while ago.
[405:12.17]A couple years ago, right?
[405:13.01]A year ago?
[405:13.57]A year and a half ago?
[405:19.13]But, thank you.
[405:23.21]I've said this a bunch of times before, but I have to stay interested.
[405:26.92]I have to stay passionate about the things that I do.
[405:31.46]Because the second that I'm not interested in not trying to give it as much as I can, at least every so often, I will turn to dust.
[405:44.07]What is this boss fight?
[405:45.01]Hold on.
[405:45.39]What is this?
[405:46.21]Boss fight.
[405:47.01]Streamer boy versus Twitch chat.
[405:50.91]Hold on a second.
[405:58.83]The same style here, too.
[406:08.58]Look at this.
[406:11.23]And by the way, can we just say, like, this track from Blordell is fucking perfect.
[406:16.85]It's great.
[406:17.77]Gonna get some more of these.
[406:21.87]Uh, why can I not put this image on here?
[406:26.74]Um, my Streamlabs OBS has crashed.
[406:29.50]I can't add, I can't do anything.
[406:33.72]Oh, there we go.
[406:34.82]Just needed a minute.
[406:40.58]Where did it go?
[406:43.18]There.
[406:57.59]Streamer boy versus Twitch chat.
[407:01.97]Oh, I get it.
[407:02.89]Those are the viewers going down.
[407:04.33]I understand.
[407:27.95]There were still a lot of people here.
[407:31.91]I think that was a pretty good turnout.
[407:35.21]And about the views.
[407:40.74]That's the dev.
[407:44.48]Official art from the dev.
[407:48.42]That's awesome.
[407:51.06]Half those people are gone.
[407:52.06]Yeah, well we ended the stream.
[407:53.16]We ended the stream like 40 minutes ago, 30 minutes ago.
[408:02.56]If you are new to the stream, though, hopefully you stick around.
[408:06.96]If you don't, if you're just checking out the stream for like a week or two, just seeing what the hell is this guy all about, what's this community all about, and then you're out of here, well, maybe we'll see you again some other time.
[408:17.41]But if you stick around, I can promise you that there's way, way more to see.
[408:27.15]Thanks for checking the stream out.
[408:34.12]As I play an idle game.
[408:36.74]I got so much stuff that I'm doing.
[408:39.51]Please watch me stare at a bar.
[408:44.39]No, they can't all be fucking carnivals.
[408:47.37]You guys know that.
[408:51.05]What are we doing tomorrow?
[408:51.78]Tomorrow is probably going to be the community night.
[408:53.82]Unless there's not enough stuff.
[409:02.10]Back to the bits though.
[409:06.97]Uh, but thank you, that was Skater Kid that gave the 500 bits.
[409:11.08]I'm glad that you have found this stream and that it clicks with you.
[409:14.52]It's all I care about.
[409:18.86]They, uh, this is also, um... Czexin?
[409:22.76]Czexins?
[409:23.76]S?
[409:24.82]Czexin?
[409:25.90]They say feetsie wheatsies.
[409:29.01]Feetsie wheatsies.
[409:29.65]Thank you for the 300 bits.
[409:40.09]Appreciate it.
[409:44.02]Hey, Jerma985, thanks for the 100 community subs.
[409:55.73]No, happy to do it.
[410:00.46]Thanks a lot.
[410:00.90]Appreciate that 100 subs.
[410:04.61]Thank you, Dr. McNinja, for the 1400 bits.
[410:09.27]$14, thank you.
[410:10.37]They just do a bunch of laughing faces.
[410:13.53]Hopefully something was funny.
[410:16.15]Funny enough, at least.
[410:23.30]Let's get the credits on here.
[410:25.52]What do you say?
[410:27.06]These are all the subs and the community subs from today.
[410:29.28]It's gonna go very fast, because there's at least 100 of them.
[410:32.05]At least.
[410:43.91]Let's see it.
[410:44.77]There it goes.
[410:45.67]Still not in the right spot.
[410:47.03]Jeremy, what do you think?
[410:52.10]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[410:54.80]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[410:56.16]Ah!
[410:56.50]There it is!
[410:56.90]I got it!
[410:59.68]Exactly where it belongs.
[411:00.84]It's going very fast.
[411:10.43]But thank you, everybody.
[411:16.69]And what do you say we start cleaning this up, too?
[411:18.29]This place is a mess.
[411:20.59]People throwing popcorn all over the place.
[411:22.21]People dump their drinks on the ground.
[411:25.75]This is a movie theater.
[411:27.15]Don't treat it like trash can, guys.
[411:31.11]Um...
[411:45.76]Do not do that.
[411:48.06]Do not give me all the money in your bank account.
[411:49.80]That would be silly.
[411:51.43]That would not be smart.
[411:52.39]I would extremely advise against that.
[412:01.41]It's like 20 bucks.
[412:06.75]You can't stop him.
[412:08.31]Yes, I can stop him.
[412:10.02]Because I'm not going to play Hollow Knight on stream.
[412:12.70]That's the easiest solution.
[412:18.78]There you go.
[412:24.57]The new one is coming out, though.
[412:26.29]Ooh!
[412:26.99]No.
[412:28.81]See me again sometime.
[412:33.92]Hmm.
[412:36.72]Hmm.
[412:40.68]When is it coming out?
[412:41.32]Next year or something?
[412:42.40]I'll take a look at it.
[412:46.14]Thank you, Mr. Spoop, for the thousand bits.
[412:49.76]Thank you.
[412:51.78]Thousand bits.
[412:52.58]Ten bucks.
[412:55.66]Again, thank you, everybody, for your subs.
[412:59.73]Appreciate it.
[413:02.67]In fact, let's switch it over to here.
[413:10.17]Sorry, I bumped you.
[413:11.58]But Mr. Spoop says, Hi Jerma, I had a long drive today and listening to, don't worry, not watching.
[413:17.66]Your stream helped it go fast.
[413:19.84]Talked about that in the beginning.
[413:21.40]For those that are curious.
[413:23.46]Just want to say thanks.
[413:24.56]Side note, this is the first time I'm giving bits and I saw that Twitch had an option to pay with cash.
[413:30.07]Huh?
[413:32.01]What do you mean pay with cash?
[413:32.67]I decided to try it out and drove to my local CVS.
[413:35.99]What?
[413:36.17]Hope your drive went very well.
[413:59.90]There's two different stories on this.
[414:02.16]I had a long drive, and I tried to pay for this in CVS.
[414:11.47]But thank you for the thousand bits.
[414:14.47]Ten bucks.
[414:15.47]And, uh, hope you had a good drive.
[414:20.76]Frility!
[414:21.78]Frility, thanks for the 5,000 bits from earlier.
[414:24.22]Why is this guy so serious about vacuuming?
[414:30.08]Why are the CVS receipts so long?
[414:32.32]Yes.
[414:33.85]Why even print receipts anymore?
[414:37.05]What's the point?
[414:39.69]All a receipt does in 2020 is get crumpled up into an annoying, bulky thing in your pocket that you then have to avoid when you're trying to get other shit out of your pocket that you are actually looking for.
[415:00.56]I can understand taxes for business expenses, right?
[415:04.03]For tax purposes.
[415:05.65]But why do I need a fucking 10-foot long receipt when I buy a vitamin water?
[415:16.47]Not just for me.
[415:17.29]It's for the coupons.
[415:26.70]Coupons?
[415:29.18]It's an alibi.
[415:36.31]You're being accused of murder.
[415:41.51]You killed two people.
[415:43.31]You're a serial killer.
[415:45.11]I have this CVS receipt that says I bought a vitamin water at fucking 2.52 PM.
[415:51.88]Exonerated.
[415:57.77]No, you can just deepfake that and just print out your own fake receipt.
[416:00.25]No, that doesn't work anymore.
[416:01.19]Nothing works anymore.
[416:02.11]Nothing is real anymore.
[416:03.47]You can fake everything now.
[416:05.49]You can print out your own receipt with the same receipt paper you bought on fucking Amazon.
[416:09.50]Go to Amazon.com and type in receipt paper.
[416:13.42]And then go to Amazon.com and type in receipt printer.
[416:17.38]And then go to the web browser in your web browser and type in receipt maker software.
[416:24.25]And go make yourself a fake fucking receipt.
[416:26.01]Nothing is real anymore.
[416:35.76]Seriously.
[416:44.20]That sounds hard.
[416:45.08]I'll just go to jail for 20 years.
[416:46.60]Oh, fuck.
[416:54.62]I'm getting an ultrasound on my abdomen, by the way.
[417:04.50]It's not when I laugh really hard or cough or like make any sudden movements.
[417:09.66]Inside of my right side hurts.
[417:15.36]Congratulations.
[417:17.56]There's a baby in here.
[417:19.99]At least I'll get Disney World.
[417:22.52]But thank you, Frulity.
[417:23.32]Thank you, Vilemi, for the 5,000 bits.
[417:25.35]It's two back-to-back 5,000-bit drops here.
[417:29.45]Dermasay0W0.
[417:33.00]I just did.
[417:34.28]Thank you, both of you, for the 50 bucks.
[417:36.94]5,000 bits.
[417:37.30]Thank you.
[417:38.20]Excellent.
[417:39.00]Excellent.
[417:39.60]Excellent.
[417:40.12]Excellent.
[417:42.79]Smellyboy, thanks for the 250 bits, as Sonic as a character has lost a lot of his appeal because his personality itself is dated.
[417:49.79]Mario is basically a blank slate character, while Sonic has all the baggage of the mid to late 90s.
[417:54.84]Holy shit.
[417:59.61]You just figured it out.
[418:07.35]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, smelly boy, tweet that.
[418:09.97]Tweet that until it's yours.
[418:11.01]Someone's gonna do that.
[418:11.55]Someone's gonna tweet that right now and get like 5,000 likes on it.
[418:15.48]Don't let him steal your original content.
[418:17.20]Tweet that right now.
[418:21.54]That's a great tweet.
[418:25.25]Don't let that get stolen from you.
[418:32.33]I guess let's get open Twitter real quick.
[418:41.38]I'll do it.
[418:44.46]Thief, thief, thief, thief.
[418:45.68]No, but that's... Yeah, that's true.
[418:49.51]That's true.
[418:50.91]That does make a lot of sense.
[418:55.95]Hey, Keith King Crimson, thanks for the 250.
[418:58.11]The ultimate evolution of Sonic going faster is making an idle clicker game where you keep increasing Sonic's speed.
[419:04.84]Not a bad idea.
[419:06.19]Tweet that.
[419:07.51]Tweet that and make it yours.
[419:09.27]Except take away Sonic.
[419:10.53]Have it be a different character.
[419:14.65]Speedo.
[419:15.49]Quick.
[419:16.43]Tweet it so it's yours.
[419:17.53]Don't let anybody take that.
[419:22.71]You wrote it here first.
[419:24.08]I got it.
[419:24.36]I have documentation that you said that.
[419:26.74]Right here.
[419:27.24]Keith King Crimson at 1943 p.m.
[419:31.83]On October 3rd, 2019.
[419:35.19]Said those words.
[419:37.48]Done.
[419:38.24]Now it's here forever.
[419:40.98]Not a bad idea, though.
[419:42.52]Hey Gnarly, thanks for the $2.50.
[419:43.70]I think this stream has solidified the fact that I have the worst taste in Jerma streams.
[419:47.06]What?
[419:49.86]I really liked the Clock Tower 3 Hearthstone and now the NGU stream.
[419:54.20]Good lord.
[419:55.90]That doesn't mean you can take my recommendations any less seriously.
[420:00.05]Clock Tower 3 was one of the top five streams I've ever done.
[420:05.96]What do you mean, bad taste?
[420:13.24]That was like one of my favorite streams ever, like top 10, really top 15.
[420:23.47]When did I do Clock Tower 3?
[420:24.33]That was a while ago.
[420:27.10]That was in Vegas though, right?
[420:28.02]That was...
[420:29.25]Post-Vegas move.
[420:31.27]Six months ago?
[420:34.31]Seven months ago?
[420:34.89]Something like that?
[420:35.82]Earlier this last year?
[420:36.82]I don't know.
[420:38.50]Something like that.
[420:40.54]You don't have bad taste.
[420:41.34]What are you talking about?
[420:43.36]Hearthstone.
[420:43.74]Alright, I'm going to have to disagree with you.
[420:44.98]Because I think that stream is bad.
[420:48.97]Hey.
[420:49.75]Doesn't matter how bad that stream was.
[420:51.27]I opened 50 packs.
[420:53.49]Automatic good content.
[421:05.09]I had to go during the clicker RPG thing.
[421:06.79]What happened?
[421:07.83]Ooh, I slayed some demons.
[421:16.65]The numbers went up.
[421:18.14]They did, yeah.
[421:20.93]Thank you, Bone Jackal, for the 500 bits.
[421:22.89]Jerma, I've been stuck in this car going past your house for hours trying to get your attention.
[421:27.02]If I slow down below 70 miles per hour, you're doing a speed joke.
[421:30.50]Okay.
[421:31.76]Please get out of here.
[421:32.66]Help me.
[421:33.00]This is a speed thing.
[421:38.69]Alright, well...
[421:44.78]What's my favorite stream?
[421:45.74]All of them.
[421:47.02]Except for Mario Tennis.
[421:48.52]That's actually the stream that I like the least.
[421:51.40]Like if I could delete a stream from everybody's memory, it would be that one.
[421:53.72]If I had like a genie that came up with three wishes, one of them would be to delete the Mario Tennis stream.
[421:58.44]Like it never happened.
[422:06.54]Not even the bird.
[422:07.06]The birdhouse stream was fucking awesome.
[422:08.48]What are you talking about?
[422:09.18]That was great!
[422:10.98]I made a birdhouse on stream.
[422:13.02]I still own it.
[422:13.74]I still have it.
[422:14.24]It's out there.
[422:14.66]Birds are in it.
[422:19.44]23 hours from now.
[422:24.16]You know, I should do like a Jerma lie emote, but it's Jerma23HR.
[422:26.98]Jerma23HRS.
[422:37.73]Hmm.
[422:39.55]Interesting.
[422:44.75]But thank you, Bone Jackal.
[422:46.17]Hopefully you figure it out.
[422:47.41]Hey, White Fox, thanks for the thousand bits.
[422:49.48]Hey man, because you're basically my therapist, here we go.
[422:52.68]I started a PhD in genetics this month.
[422:54.80]Holy shit.
[422:55.96]But it's four hours from my fiancé, and we miss each other.
[423:00.02]Long-distance wedding planning is ass.
[423:02.86]considering just dropping the program and moving to be closer to her have some connections with entomology closer to her but it pays less what's your advice also more importantly it hits her ass I'd read that um um okay I'm a whole I'm a whole picture kind of guy there you go that's your answer to that one why did I answer it I don't know uh but to answer the other question
[423:28.66]You need to do what you... Fuck.
[423:31.64]You need to do what you think... You need to do what you think is best.
[423:43.82]If you think that making more money is more important to you, then do it.
[423:48.98]If you think that being closer to somebody that you really care about is more important, then do it.
[423:55.99]You are right now, you are getting telltaled right now, unfortunately, it happens.
[424:01.41]At least a few times in everybody's life, you get telltaled.
[424:15.48]Bankrupt.
[424:16.10]No, no, you have like a choice that affects your life, that is really one or the other.
[424:24.71]It depends how much less money, right?
[424:26.45]Are you talking like a million versus like 50 grand?
[424:31.85]You know what I'm saying?
[424:33.35]Is it like ridiculously less?
[424:35.89]Then that weighs a little more, right?
[424:46.70]Weddings are really pricey.
[424:48.30]They are.
[424:54.38]I would say if it's as large monetary gain, yes.
[424:58.79]But you also want to stay happy.
[425:00.05]You want to keep yourself happy.
[425:03.31]If work is not going to make you happy, then do the thing that's going to make you happy.
[425:08.85]If being closer to somebody that you really care about is going to make you feel better and your job that you could do there better, I would say do that.
[425:16.60]Because you don't want to run into a scenario where you're very far away and you're making a little bit more money
[425:23.41]But you wish you weren't doing that.
[425:28.15]You need to be completely comfortable with that decision.
[425:32.17]And I think the comfortable decision is the second one.
[425:41.02]But it also depends.
[425:42.74]There's a lot of factors here.
[425:46.90]How much do you want that PhD?
[425:48.90]How long is it going to take?
[425:56.95]If you can put up with doing that for a little while, to get your PhD and do that... Then it might be worth it, you know what I'm saying?
[426:07.22]Why are you asking this motherfucker for advice?
[426:15.52]Easy!
[426:19.51]I'm trying to help!
[426:24.47]No, but for real.
[426:30.08]Giving advice like this is tough because I don't know where your priorities lie.
[426:35.69]Everybody has different priorities.
[426:38.03]Everybody has a pre-shit prep.
[426:39.37]Everybody has a post-shit prep.
[426:40.51]Some people stretch.
[426:41.23]That's what I've heard.
[426:45.96]But your plan has to be what you want.
[426:50.62]Not what I would want.
[426:52.16]Because I don't know if what I want is what you would want too.
[426:57.62]To me it sounds like
[427:01.03]you are putting a lot of weight on being closer to the person that you love.
[427:09.33]Sometimes that, on the scale, tips way more.
[427:16.89]And depending on how long it takes for you to get that PhD, it might be worth doing it and then moving.
[427:23.21]Depends on how badly you want it.
[427:26.53]I'm avoiding the question.
[427:27.47]I just, I just said, I just said the second one's probably a better idea.
[427:30.14]I just said it.
[427:30.70]I just did it.
[427:31.26]I just said it.
[427:31.82]I just said it.
[427:32.50]I just said that!
[427:36.50]Okay, but tits or ass.
[427:37.52]I already said it.
[427:43.35]He asked for advice, not a self-help novel.
[427:46.71]Well, I, what do you, how do you give advice?
[427:52.92]Advice?
[427:53.32]That is advice.
[427:54.48]I am giving advice.
[427:55.62]That's what I'm doing.
[428:01.94]WhiteFox, don't listen to these jokers in here.
[428:10.16]But the most important question there was, you know, I answered it for you.
[428:18.92]Jokers.
[428:20.16]You're doing your best.
[428:23.91]But all jokes aside, it's hard to give advice when I don't know the kind of gravity of the situation.
[428:29.01]I don't know what you really want.
[428:34.23]It's gonna take a lot of thinking, but hopefully you figure it out.
[428:36.51]I really do wish you the best.
[428:42.06]But if you're good at something, never do it for free.
[428:43.64]That's exactly... yes.
[428:46.92]Hey, Aqua Reaper, thanks for the thousand and five bits...
[428:51.74]Terma, how do you feel that I live in your house and always remain out of sight waiting to strangle you?
[428:55.98]Well, that was fucking strange.
[428:59.24]When you finally catch a shiny Pokémon.
[429:05.80]Terma, how do you feel that I live in your house and always remain out of sight waiting to strangle you to death when you finally catch a shiny Pokémon?
[429:14.31]What the fuck is this message?
[429:33.35]Listen to me.
[429:35.51]I don't play Pokémon.
[429:40.15]And I'm quick.
[429:43.23]That quick!
[429:47.57]Yet.
[429:47.99]I don't play Pokémon.
[429:49.61]I don't play Pokémon.
[430:00.67]Okay.
[430:01.17]This is fucking me up so much.
[430:04.08]Thank you to... Thank you to Scrooge for the 300 bits.
[430:20.07]I can't believe I've been here so long.
[430:21.53]I remember watching during the old TF2 days.
[430:24.55]Been loving everything you put out.
[430:25.95]I've been so busy.
[430:27.35]Hold on.
[430:41.94]Oh my goodness, okay.
[430:43.88]Anyways, I remember watching during the old TF2 days, been loving everything you put up.
[430:48.16]Been so busy, and I've been missing some lately, but I at least was able to catch the carnival.
[430:53.33]I'm glad you did.
[430:54.67]Anyways, I've been trying to introduce some friends to you, but I've had some trouble choosing a good intro video to your channel.
[430:58.85]Any suggestions?
[431:02.49]Video.
[431:03.19]Uh, I would say... Jerma Rumble Live is a pretty good one, I think.
[431:09.97]Mario Tennis.
[431:10.83]Get the fuck out of here with that one.
[431:14.89]The Jerma Rumble series, I think, is a pretty good start, I think.
[431:19.48]That's some of my proudest work.
[431:22.10]I still do have proud work, too.
[431:23.82]It's not that.
[431:26.56]But that was the culmination of my entire life on YouTube, so... That requires so much knowledge.
[431:34.98]That's why you started at 1.
[431:35.68]You started at 1!
[431:40.77]Castle of Gryffindor as well, I think, is just standalone.
[431:44.49]Really, really, really like that video.
[431:47.71]There's a lot.
[431:51.30]Or, just start them with the Dark Souls 3 streams.
[431:54.06]So they can know that I did it on stream, that I'm very good at video games sometimes.
[432:00.12]That's where you should start.
[432:02.73]Thank you, KXZ501.
[432:04.51]What's going on?
[432:05.33]Welcome back, KXZ.
[432:07.54]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[432:08.60]Thanks for another great stream.
[432:09.66]Hope you're doing well these days.
[432:10.74]I'm doing great.
[432:12.60]I am doing great.
[432:15.26]Better than ever.
[432:15.76]I feel great.
[432:19.33]Except for my abdomen.
[432:20.57]There's a problem in there.
[432:21.53]We'll figure it out.
[432:26.05]A see-through gold play.
[432:27.39]I wouldn't start there.
[432:29.21]You know what?
[432:29.77]I would start them on this stream.
[432:33.23]Yeah.
[432:34.29]Because if you can't handle this stream...
[432:37.44]How the hell can you imagine handling anything else?
[432:40.46]If you can't handle me at my worst, obey your thirst.
[432:43.92]If you can't handle me at my best... Go take a fucking rest.
[433:04.06]Sleep.
[433:06.30]Alright, guys.
[433:08.79]Theater's not closed.
[433:10.35]Get out of here.
[433:12.07]Get out.
[433:12.43]Get out of here.
[433:17.25]See you guys tomorrow for something.
[433:19.85]Something, something, something, something.
[433:23.63]Wait.
[433:25.52]Good night.
[433:26.58]Goodbye.
[433:27.08]Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[433:31.24]See you tomorrow.
[433:32.82]Much love to y'all.
[433:33.96]Check out the game.
[433:35.36]The game, the game, the game, the game.
[433:37.30]NGU Idol.
[433:38.68]And... Hot Lava was fun.
[433:41.00]I'm just not very good.
[433:42.12]It was still fun.
[433:47.08]And I've got an hour and 17 minutes here.
[433:49.02]I can rebirth this and it's gonna be great.
[433:52.55]I'm gonna eat like a huge... I'm gonna eat a huge just bucket of wings.
[433:57.15]Watch numbers go up for the rest of the night, I think.
[433:59.03]And then fall asleep.
[434:01.67]Goodnight everybody.
[434:03.11]See you tomorrow.
