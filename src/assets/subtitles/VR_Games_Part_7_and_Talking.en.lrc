[00:00.41]You're ordering Chinese food?
[00:02.91]Alright.
[00:04.23]You ready?
[00:07.15]I got it.
[00:07.57]I got it.
[00:07.97]You want me to tell you what I want?
[00:09.24]Here we go.
[00:10.94]Crab Rangoons.
[00:15.56]Spare ribs.
[00:22.76]Noodle.
[00:24.92]That's it?
[00:27.93]Alright, let's open Elven Assassin.
[00:30.98]Stop killing time here.
[00:32.02]I feel like it's been a majority of this stream.
[00:35.84]Sorry for everybody that wanted some more VR for Mindshow.
[00:41.66]It's kind of hard to work with sometimes.
[00:43.93]So, I know a lot of people may have left.
[00:47.51]I'm sorry.
[00:49.89]Just do what I can, right?
[00:51.31]That's all I can do.
[00:53.63]Elven Assassin.
[00:54.47]Let's try it.
[00:59.00]Spare ribs.
[00:59.48]Oh, yeah.
[00:59.96]Spare ribs are the best.
[01:08.40]Elven Assassin.
[01:10.72]This is an early game.
[01:11.68]I'm sure it is.
[01:17.23]Hey, but thanks for sticking it out.
[01:20.09]I say that a lot, but... You know, sometimes you come across shit that you didn't know existed in the first place, so... Appreciate the support.
[01:27.31]Let's go.
[01:29.02]I'm ready.
[01:32.80]This is an early access, so some things will improve along the way if you find any issues...
[01:38.21]Alright, well, this is wrong again, Jeremy!
[01:42.29]Uh, I gotta change this from Mindshow to Elvin Assassin, unfortunately.
[01:51.65]Look at that.
[02:01.26]Go ahead.
[02:02.98]A, B, C, D!
[02:07.89]I like cringed people out of the channel.
[02:15.35]Archery platforms don't match your play area.
[02:17.63]Should we not be used to play?
[02:18.69]Okay, whatever.
[02:21.81]Single play is fine.
[02:23.81]RPG?
[02:25.41]I guess.
[02:25.75]What the fuck is happening here?
[02:29.01]No, the same shit that happens every time you play VR.
[02:31.03]What's happening?
[02:35.09]Um, I'm ordering Chinese food.
[02:36.43]I want to know what you want.
[02:37.77]Oh, I put it in the chat.
[02:39.11]Oh, you did?
[02:39.95]Oh, what do you want?
[02:40.63]Okay, ready?
[02:42.03]Crab ragout.
[02:42.95]Okay.
[02:43.57]Spare ribs.
[02:44.39]Okay.
[02:45.15]And some kind of noodle.
[02:46.65]Like lo mein?
[02:47.55]Yeah.
[02:47.75]Okay.
[02:48.31]Alright, sorry about that.

[05:47.83]I'm going to break my VR.
[06:23.14]Whatever, he'll be fine.
[06:25.16]He's slow, just go around him in a circle with a rope.
[06:29.04]This is just mind show!
[07:04.08]They're breaking in!
[08:36.54]Is this the whole game?
[08:39.30]Shit.

[15:28.42]Alright, so the title of the stream is Improv Acting Workshop.
[15:33.34]And we're going back into Dread Halls.
[15:38.04]I feel like the title can stay.

[16:25.69]It really does.
[16:30.21]God, computers.

[21:07.83]I didn't run.
[21:09.09]I raised my gaze and moved to touch them.
[21:12.50]They blended with me, agony, freedom, despair, understanding.
[21:16.48]Shut the fuck up.
[21:30.35]To be judged.
[21:31.69]To prove your worth.
[21:33.65]To satisfy your curiosity.
[21:36.93]Or to be forgotten here, like many others before you.

[108:13.46]Like this.
[108:18.52]Am I mad at Kim?
[108:21.20]No, what?
[108:22.80]It was funny.
[108:24.54]Comedy trumps everything, okay?
[108:27.24]If somebody does something at your expense and it's funny, okay.
[108:31.46]It was funny.
[108:33.82]No, why would, she's wonderful, what?
[108:37.10]Why would I be mad at my girlfriend for like hiding in the closet for 30 minutes?
[108:42.19]No, that was great.
[108:45.31]Only Chad's have kids.
[108:46.77]I don't have any kids.
[108:47.43]I'm never going to have kids.

[109:09.38]Lemon.
[109:10.81]It's probably lemon.
[109:13.58]Why don't I want kids?
[109:15.80]Because you have to change their diapers and they shit all over themselves.
[109:20.62]That's it.
[109:28.59]That's it.
[109:32.67]Am I a vegan?
[109:33.71]No.
[109:34.43]Never will be.
[109:36.89]Hamburgers are too tasty.
[109:38.02]I could never do it.
[109:40.10]Steak and cheese subs are the reason I could never be a vegan because of Philly cheesesteaks.
[109:45.92]I eat them like once a year, but that's the reason.
[109:52.30]Would I eat lab-grown meat?
[109:55.01]Yeah.
[109:57.33]Why not?
[109:57.91]I would try it once.
[109:59.41]If I didn't like it, then I would fucking delete my Twitch Prime.
[110:04.97]Longest gone without changing underwear.
[110:06.83]That's a pet peeve of mine.
[110:07.75]Not even a day.
[110:09.36]I change my underwear once a day.
[110:11.82]You think that's bullshit?
[110:14.52]How could I prove that?
[110:15.36]There's no way.
[110:21.22]Longest I've gone without showering.
[110:24.36]A day.
[110:25.34]One day.
[110:27.20]One day.
[110:27.70]That's it.
[110:28.65]That's it.
[110:31.35]You used to be such a meathead.
[110:32.57]Did you really stop lifting?
[110:33.71]Yeah, it just became too much.
[110:36.43]I walk every day because I'm a fucking boomer.

[110:40.85]Do you guys understand that?
[110:43.95]I'm 34.
[110:44.31]I'm 34 in like a few months.
[110:47.63]That's fucking old.
[110:49.47]I can't go like throw weights around anymore.
[110:51.67]You understand?
[110:52.23]I can't do that anymore.
[110:57.30]I wish I could.
[111:03.56]What's my birthday?
[111:05.06]August 4th.
[111:09.75]I did... That was the... I told you I didn't want to give the... It's in September.
[111:15.93]I don't know why I did that.
[111:20.52]Any conventions or meetups in the future?
[111:23.64]Well, it's funny you say that.
[111:26.58]There is a place in Las Vegas called the Level Up Lounge.
[111:33.18]Okay.
[111:34.82]This place is really cool.
[111:36.16]They got like games.
[111:37.05]They have like skee-ball.
[111:38.19]They got like fucking...
[111:40.25]It's pretty cool.
[111:41.07]They got like a bar, there's Jenga, there's like pool tables.
[111:48.11]I was thinking, now hold on, don't quote me on this.
[111:51.37]I'm about to say it, but don't quote me.
[111:54.62]I might.
[111:55.86]Don't fucking quote me on this.
[111:57.04]I'll be very upset about it.
[111:59.76]I might see if I can do a private party.
[112:03.80]Don't fucking you dare quote me on this.
[112:08.53]where I rent out the Level Up Lounge, and we just have a fucking good time.
[112:16.93]Don't quote me on that, but I thought about it.
[112:19.48]Seems fun.
[112:24.30]The Level Up Lounge is in the MGM Casino in Las Vegas.
[112:29.56]You know, like, fuck going to E3.
[112:31.60]What happened here?
[112:33.76]Fuck E3, fuck, I was gonna say the T word.
[112:38.42]Fuck like E3.
[112:39.80]Fuck like PAX West.
[112:41.26]No, let's do our own shit, right?
[112:43.10]Let's do our own thing.
[112:45.54]Come to JermaCon at the Level Up Lounge.
[112:50.92]This isn't real.
[112:52.50]Like, hopefully I don't piss off somebody at Level Up Lounge.
[112:55.28]It's a great place.
[112:56.60]The place is fucking great.
[112:58.73]It's a really, really clean, wonderful place with a great bar.
[113:02.77]We'll see.
[113:07.25]Come to Brazil?
[113:08.81]I don't know.
[113:09.31]I don't got any money.
[113:14.94]JermaCon at the Level Up Lounge.
[113:16.46]You can do a private party.
[113:17.42]We'll see.
[113:17.76]It might be fun.
[113:18.98]There's a karaoke.
[113:19.88]You can do LAN parties.
[113:21.06]There's like a VR.
[113:22.54]There's an entire VR setup at the Level Up Lounge at MGM.
[113:28.07]If you work for MGM, you don't have my phone number, but I might give it to you at some point.
[113:36.99]That would be a lot of fun.
[113:39.41]To do a full-on meetup, but open bar and open karaoke, open VR setup.
[113:48.50]I would just pay for the whole fucking thing.
[113:50.56]And we could have a good time.
[113:51.58]If you're in Vegas for a fucking weekend, come on out.
[113:54.68]This isn't real yet, but it might be in a few months.
[114:00.41]Open bar is a bad move?
[114:01.59]No, it's not.
[114:02.51]It's a good move.
[114:07.61]It would be 21+.
[114:09.36]Sorry.
[114:10.40]It would have to be.
[114:11.92]Get Penn and Teller?
[114:13.06]Nah, I would do my own magic tricks.
[114:19.66]Open bar with VR?
[114:20.84]I think that would be fun.
[114:22.48]It would be.
[114:25.25]If I ponied up the cash to have whoever... Here's the thing I didn't understand before I moved to Las Vegas.
[114:32.31]There's a lot of people that live...
[114:34.92]in Vegas, a lot of you guys live here, and in LA.
[114:39.57]So fuck it, let's do it.
[114:41.97]I don't care how much it costs, fuck it, who cares?
[114:47.03]It don't fucking matter.
[114:49.13]That doesn't matter.
[114:50.83]If I can afford it, oh, you better fucking believe I'll do it.
[114:59.06]Fuck it.
[115:01.70]VRChat meetup.
[115:07.36]JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR 5 community subs.
[115:10.24]Thank you.
[115:14.48]You could do that?
[115:14.98]I probably could.
[115:16.74]I really don't think that would cost that much money.
[115:21.20]Is this drunk talk?
[115:22.58]Not really.
[115:23.05]It's more like just hangout talk.
[115:30.15]You can ask Kim.
[115:32.47]Me and Kim went to this place.
[115:34.49]And we specifically, it was like, how fun would this be to do a meetup here?
[115:38.87]Because I get, you know, you can do a meetup at PAX.
[115:40.99]You can do a meetup at E3.
[115:42.75]No, fuck it.
[115:43.56]Let's do our own.
[115:45.48]Let's do our big bits.
[115:46.96]Oh, Jesus.
[115:47.46]What happened?
[115:50.42]Colonel Zero, thanks for the 50 bucks.
[115:53.42]Can you pay for my plane ticket?
[115:55.06]No, I can't.
[115:56.62]I can pay for the booze at the bar and the space.
[116:00.90]But I can't pay for plane tickets.
[116:06.33]And he said this.

[128:30.85]Let's go for it.
[128:34.85]No, I don't.
[131:05.66]How, I was quiet for a long time.
[131:22.77]It's not bad.
[131:25.89]Alright, that's it.
[131:27.37]What else, what else you got?
[131:32.85]Vinny said he loves you.
[131:34.83]Hey, thanks, Vinny.
[131:36.27]You're a pretty good guy.
[131:43.59]Explain becoming a tree.
[131:45.10]Alright, alright, alright.
[131:46.12]This is important.
[131:46.80]Alright, everybody that was gonna leave has already left, okay?
[131:55.46]We had like 4,400 people here like two hours ago.
[132:00.47]They've moved on, they're probably watching something.
[132:02.13]That's fine, okay.
[132:02.99]But the 2,800 people that are still here?
[132:15.97]What is going on with trees?
[132:19.54]You cut their limbs off, they come back?
[132:23.84]How have we not figured out, as humans, how to genetically
[132:30.75]Tap into that complete regrowth.
[132:35.41]Seriously.
[132:37.07]Trees, they fucking grow back.
[132:38.79]They last thousands of years, some trees.
[132:44.64]Imagine in 100 years, if they can tap into the DNA of trees.
[132:56.28]I'm getting made fun of.
[133:12.22]It was a thought experiment.
[133:14.30]Never mind.
[133:19.35]Sounds... No, no, no, no, no.
[133:20.37]Listen, listen.
[133:24.17]Besides humans, right?
[133:30.75]Did I eat any edibles?
[133:32.75]No.
[133:34.87]No.
[133:35.37]Not tonight.
[133:36.27]Not any night.
[133:39.63]Oh, they got a picture of the black hole.
[133:40.99]That's right.
[133:42.80]They got a full-on picture of the black hole.
[133:45.92]Let's take a look at it.
[133:56.25]Black hole, there it is.
[133:57.15]It's kind of boring.
[134:02.42]Looks like a donut.
[134:17.34]Let's see it.
[134:21.82]So this is a picture of a black hole.
[134:28.61]I mean, it kind of looks like what happens when you go underwater and open your eyes and look at a light.
[134:34.23]That shit's coming for you and that it's going to wipe out everybody.
[134:41.08]That's the last thing you see before you die.
[134:44.94]Yep.
[134:49.00]Like, a blurry, like, The Ring 3 image.
[135:02.27]Can I what?
[135:05.19]What the fuck did you just say?
[135:06.28]Holy shit.
[135:11.72]Why worry about black holes when you stream as this derailed?
[135:15.24]I made that up.
[135:16.08]Somebody didn't write that.
[135:17.00]I said that, pretending to be a chat member.
[135:34.40]How long is this stream?
[135:35.52]It's been six and a half hours?
[135:48.62]Watch an old video?
[135:54.20]No, no, not tonight.
[135:59.35]Not tonight.
[136:08.47]Do a backflip.
[136:09.35]Sure.
[136:25.81]Fucking easy.
[136:32.12]Fucking easiest thing I've done all day.
[136:38.92]Any other questions or requests?
[136:51.46]Do a cartwheel?
[136:52.00]It's the fucking easiest thing I've done all day.
[137:02.07]I'll do two.

[137:49.68]I'm so self-conscious about this hair.
[137:52.46]It's so bad.
[137:59.57]Will I ever go to Australia?
[138:01.37]No, probably not.

[156:44.12]Try tomorrow.
[156:45.12]Ah, we'll see.
[156:49.59]I'm okay, I just wanted to play when not drunk.
[156:56.03]That was a lot going on there.
[157:06.02]Well, thank you for watching, everybody.
[157:10.75]That's it.
[157:12.69]I'm gonna go eat some crab rangoons.
[157:14.63]I did not think this was gonna be a seven hour stream.
[157:18.01]What is going on here?
[157:21.37]I don't... whatever.
[157:26.72]Thanks for watching.
[157:27.48]Thanks for sticking around.
[157:30.32]I'll see you guys hopefully tomorrow.
[157:34.22]Unless we sit here and have another glass of wine and have a few conversations.
[157:38.46]No.
[157:44.39]I'll probably be live tomorrow.
[157:46.29]What the fuck was I doing?
[157:54.21]Uh, in actuality, I'll probably see you on fucking... On Friday, probably!
[157:58.99]What an idiot.
[158:03.49]What a stupid motherfucker.
[158:05.05]Like, I was gonna do three VR days in a row, like four to five hours each.
[158:08.29]This is like a seven hour drunk stream.
[158:09.89]What a dumb dickhead.
[158:24.20]But regardless, I had a lot of fun.
[158:28.54]I hope you did too.
[158:30.50]If you didn't, I'm sorry.
[158:31.90]I can do better.
[158:32.40]I'll try better.
[158:33.64]I'll try harder.
[158:35.88]If you did, I'm glad you did.
[158:37.14]If not, then I'm trying.
[158:39.52]I'll see you soon.
[158:43.57]I'm going to go have some crab rangoons, but let's do the bits.
[158:50.57]Look, I look drunker than I am, okay?
[158:53.55]It looks like somebody fucking shook me up and threw me and hit me in the face with a shovel.
[158:58.66]That's because of the hair.
[159:01.12]Okay, look, ready?
[159:03.20]How do I look now?
[159:05.18]Probably pretty good.
[159:07.28]But like, it's the hair.
[159:09.85]The hair fucks me up.
[159:10.67]I'm deleting.
[159:14.72]But thank you so much for joining me.
[159:17.10]I'll see you soon.
[159:19.45]I hope you liked it.
[159:22.03]I did.
[159:22.99]I had a great time.
[159:27.35]But let's do the bits.
[159:32.42]See you guys in probably a day and a half.
[159:36.86]Because Jeremy's 34 and drinks and has to sleep for a whole day.
[159:42.74]Took three days off.
[159:44.68]God damn it.
[159:45.22]What an idiot.
[159:45.78]What an asshole.
[159:48.84]Thank you guys.
[159:50.50]So we had a meaty matey.
[159:52.49]Thanks for 10 bucks.
[159:55.55]Especially with wine.
[159:56.39]What a bad choice.
[159:57.21]But it was fun.
[159:57.89]I had a great time.
[159:59.01]I had a great fucking time.
[160:00.65]I really did.
[160:03.29]What a blast.
[160:03.87]I really did.
[160:06.69]Uh, meaty meaty ten bucks.
[160:09.22]Thank you for brightening all of our days with your streams and being the only person I can watch on Twitch.
[160:15.40]Uh, thank you.
[160:18.72]That means a lot.
[160:20.68]I hope you enjoy yourself here.
[160:22.48]I really do.
[160:26.28]Regardless if I drink wine or not, I hope you have fun.
[160:30.60]Because I had fun.
[160:31.72]I hope that means you did too.
[160:34.74]Superintendent Chalmers, thanks for the 250.
[160:37.55]Please grow a massive Tormund beard.
[160:39.55]It would be a scarecrow.
[160:40.47]It'd be terrible.
[160:41.69]You wouldn't want to look at it.
[160:42.61]It'd be ugly.
[160:49.19]Smelly Boy, thanks for the 250.
[160:50.72]Desk infested by gamer god.
[160:52.78]I don't know what that means, but thank you.
[160:57.52]Bake me home 250.
[160:59.08]Less than 20 days till Avengers.
[161:00.72]Are we excited or what?
[161:04.91]Yeah, kind of.
[161:07.53]Kind of.
[161:08.92]Should be a good movie.
[161:09.98]Hope it is.
[161:12.44]What wine am I drinking?
[161:13.76]This is a Malbec.
[161:15.60]Malbec is my favorite wine.
[161:18.12]It is the best.
[161:20.90]If you can get your hands on a Malbec, please do.
[161:23.85]It's good shit.
[161:27.49]Jerma lied about stream legends.
[161:30.31]What kind of name is that?
[161:35.63]That's not... I do that every day.
[161:38.15]Every other stream.
[161:39.11]What are you... What?
[161:39.63]What are you talking about?
[161:40.77]I do that every stream.
[161:49.59]You'll get it at the end, I promise.
[161:53.54]DoorCube.
[161:54.14]Hey, DoorCube.
[161:54.68]Thanks for the $2.50, DoorCube.
[161:56.90]You are screaming way too much.
[161:58.40]I did not raise you like this.
[161:59.82]I did not raise you like this.
[162:01.26]You scream too much.
[162:07.07]I forget every skit I made in that game.
[162:13.56]I hope they were funny.
[162:18.32]Thank you, Combino, for the $5.
[162:19.84]Hey, Jerma, it's me, Combine.
[162:23.78]My account was stolen by someone from Malaysia.
[162:28.27]Can you make characters have sex with each other in this game?
[162:30.81]Do it.
[162:31.21]I give you money.
[162:36.88]Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Combine.
[162:41.06]I don't think you can.
[162:42.70]Maybe if you really put your imagination into it, maybe.
[162:47.65]Ugh.
[162:49.83]Hey, Flugboy!
[162:50.81]Thanks for the 20 bucks, Flugboy.
[162:52.09]20 bucks.
[162:55.59]Hey, Jerma, thought I'd drop you a good amount of bits tonight.
[162:57.65]Hope you are doing well and having a beautiful Duwang.
[163:01.34]Duwang.
[163:04.80]Also...
[163:05.98]Really, I'm hoping Kiem comes down and smacks you after screaming.
[163:10.88]She did.
[163:12.40]She scared the fuck out of me.
[163:16.00]Ah, that's a JoJo reference.
[163:17.34]Okay.
[163:22.01]Thank you, though.
[163:22.47]Thank you, Frodeon.
[163:23.25]Weapon for the 250.
[163:24.57]No message, but thank you, Frodeon.
[163:26.97]Internet Jorge, thanks for the 15 bucks.
[163:30.33]Much love, Jerma.
[163:35.09]Much love to you.
[163:42.31]Um... I mean, you just watch a guy, like, drink wine and get, like, drunk.
[163:49.06]And play a VR game.
[163:53.70]And I made a fucking ton of money.
[163:56.36]Seriously.
[163:58.20]Do you understand like how much that fucking means to me?
[164:06.59]I can't even tell you.
[164:08.31]I really can't.
[164:13.93]I wish there was another way that I could tell you that.
[164:21.10]Thank you for everything.
[164:24.08]And...
[164:27.06]As long as you're having a good time, that's all I fucking care about.
[164:31.40]That's the only fucking thing I care about.
[164:36.30]Even if I need to talk shit and make fun of it, of course we're all gonna prod at the stream sometimes.
[164:44.49]Thank you.
[164:46.49]You guys mean more than you think.
[164:49.39]Seriously.
[164:52.95]For real.
[165:00.15]Never ever in a million years did I think that somebody would think it was fun to, like, watch me drink wine and, like, make shitty videos in Mind Chill.
[165:11.68]I... I am forever fucking grateful.
[165:17.28]Thank you for everything.
[165:22.84]Seriously.
[165:24.66]You don't understand how much that actually means.
[165:30.51]Not only, Jorge, did you give me 15 bucks, but that message.
[165:38.66]I wish I could tell you more how much that actually fucking really means.
[165:44.04]For real.
[165:44.70]I wish I could.
[165:48.66]But thank you so much.
[165:52.61]VRJosh.
[165:57.65]$6 from VRJosh, one of the resident VIPs.
[166:01.25]Sorry about the technical difficulties.
[166:02.67]You handled it really well.
[166:06.21]VR streaming can be extra rough sometimes, but I appreciate you trying to make it work.
[166:11.60]No, I know that too.
[166:12.38]And like, look, Mindshow is amazing.
[166:17.00]It's a great idea.
[166:18.13]The people behind it, they really give a fuck.
[166:20.91]You can tell.
[166:21.29]So my frustrations with the game are not necessarily...
[166:29.72]Take it with a grain of salt, because we had some issues with it, but it was still a lot of fun.
[166:34.28]It really was.
[166:34.76]I don't mean my frustrations to be taken out on the developers of the game, because I do think it's really great.
[166:47.06]I hope they continue to improve it.
[166:48.42]I mean, it's a great concept.
[166:56.31]But thank you, Josh.
[166:57.80]VRJosh.
[167:02.22]I loved it.
[167:02.66]I had a great, I had a lot of fun.
[167:06.88]I still think, I would still recommend that game.
[167:10.14]Just because of what they're trying to do with the platform.
[167:15.13]It was good shit.
[167:16.01]For real.
[167:17.67]Hey, Pizza Bot!
[167:18.69]Pizza Bot.
[167:21.15]Five dollars from Pizza Bot.
[167:22.51]This is a fever dream.
[167:25.19]Yeah, that's kind of how it works here sometimes.
[167:29.21]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the $2.50.
[167:30.41]Hey Jeremy, just want to say you're such a funny man.
[167:33.83]Keep being yourself.
[167:35.40]Going to Texas tomorrow.
[167:37.28]So I'll miss a bunch of the streams, but I hope you enjoy the rest of your week.
[167:41.80]Love you, Jeremy, in chat.
[167:42.66]I'm sure they appreciate that.
[167:47.50]Thank you for the $2.50.
[167:49.12]Thanks for the wonderful message.
[167:53.37]Hey Jess, you got it.
[167:54.79]Thanks for the 250.
[167:56.42]This is how your fight scene directing looked.
[168:00.10]God, what is this?
[168:10.45]This is the Liam Neeson jumps the fence.
[168:19.53]I can't believe they actually kept this.
[168:22.25]Why would you not change that?
[168:24.87]That is so absolutely disgusting in a filmmaking sense.
[168:29.37]And I really, I mean that.
[168:31.31]Holy shit.
[168:32.25]That was unbearable.
[168:40.53]But thank you, Jesse, you got it for the $2.50.
[168:43.11]Hey, PilotGuy, thanks for $15, PilotGuy.
[168:47.37]I'm fine.
[168:48.05]Seriously, though, I haven't laughed this hard in a while.
[168:50.67]Thanks, Tremo.
[168:51.57]Thank you.
[168:54.07]Glad you had a good time.
[168:59.74]Thank you for the $15 and your wonderful, amazing message.
[169:03.52]Thank you.
[169:05.78]Mostly lost.
[169:06.52]Thanks for the 250.
[169:07.38]Hey, Geronimo, I'm gonna leave this Academy Award nominee by Kiwo here and its sequel, which is even better.
[169:14.57]Sorry, not sorry.
[169:15.89]Kiwo, deal with it.
[169:16.99]What are you talking about?
[169:19.95]Cherry Chapstick.
[169:21.47]What is this?
[169:26.32]Hold on.
[169:37.99]It's a Kiwo video.
[169:38.84]I mean we got to watch the whole fucking thing
[170:15.88]Where's the audio?
[170:19.72]What happened to the audio?
[170:20.70]Okay, well, we gotta make it like a fucking real video together.
[170:33.35]I didn't do anything.
[170:35.07]I just like shut off.
[170:42.56]Lawsuit.
[170:44.34]I just played the video.
[170:47.78]Kiwo went to bed three hours ago.
[170:49.28]I don't blame her.
[170:50.80]It's late.
[170:52.40]It's like 2 a.m.
[170:53.38]Eastern.
[170:54.28]Like 6, 5, 6 a.m.
[170:56.27]EU.
[171:00.33]The vibe may have... The vibe probably fucked it up, but thank you, MostlyLost.
[171:04.89]Kiwo and I will make content together, I promise.
[171:08.75]She's hilarious.
[171:09.99]She's talented.
[171:11.93]Of course I'd want to make content with somebody like that.
[171:16.01]For real.
[171:16.97]Like, it's going to happen.
[171:21.08]It's never happening.
[171:24.46]Hey, Mostly Lost, thanks again for the $2.50.
[171:28.20]We can probably piece together the ABC video with the first person's perspectives when you were filming it and the final audio from the end.
[171:36.85]I don't even know what you're talking about.
[171:38.03]I forgot it.
[171:45.62]Didn't I lose like 700 fucking viewers during that segment?
[171:51.51]That's embarrassing.
[171:53.57]I lost like a thousand viewers.
[172:03.35]That's so bad.
[172:04.35]Okay, if I was a marketing person, I would come to me and be like, hey dude, don't fucking do that again.
[172:14.98]You lost a thousand people.
[172:17.42]You lost like 20% of your whole audience.
[172:22.08]That's a new record.
[172:24.46]Oh, who cares?
[172:26.77]Who gives a fuck, right?
[172:31.57]It's all good.
[172:36.63]But thank you, Mostly Lost.
[172:37.85]Uh, Pasta Globs.
[172:41.77]$2.50. $2.50.
[172:44.08]Bless you for putting up with dumb technical bullshit for as long as you could.
[172:47.30]We love you.
[172:48.80]Thank you.
[172:51.38]I think it was worth it because the game is worth it.
[172:53.48]So, I think so.
[172:59.31]Demias, thanks for five subs.
[173:01.73]Demias, thank you.
[173:04.25]Jermor lied about Minecraft VR, five subs.
[173:08.25]Rin the cutest, three subs.
[173:10.39]Dr. Steen, five subs.
[173:12.88]Sroiliot.
[173:14.22]Sroiliot gave 20.
[173:17.18]Which is un-fucking-believable.
[173:20.56]Thank you, Sroiliot.
[173:22.70]Sroiliot.
[173:24.16]Sroiliot won.
[173:27.44]JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR.
[173:29.44]Another 10 community subs.
[173:34.89]I can't fucking believe you'd give this many subs.
[173:37.15]Thank you.
[173:40.00]That's a lot of money.
[173:41.00]It's a lot of contribution.
[173:42.10]It's a ton of fucking... It's a big paycheck.
[173:46.66]I can't even... Thank you.
[173:51.40]15 community subs tonight.
[173:53.16]I... I don't have much else to say.
[173:57.27]I can't believe it.
[173:57.91]Thank you.
[174:00.13]Jerma lied about Fruity Loops.
[174:02.05]I lie about everything.
[174:03.85]Jerma, what's up?
[174:04.55]Like the stream, but I think Fruity Loops would be better.
[174:06.38]I do too.
[174:07.82]And a real guitarist to be hired to play the guitar on the stream.
[174:13.16]I'm working on it.
[174:15.90]JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR.
[174:18.19]Lying about a lot of things tonight.
[174:20.95]Hey Benito, maybe in your drunken stupor you'll reconsider your weird authoritarian stance on enabling the Pog emote.
[174:36.43]Like, really?
[174:39.49]We got this shit.
[174:40.79]That's better than... That's the best.
[174:44.55]Do you need anything else besides that?
[174:48.86]ManBearPig!
[174:49.92]$15 from ManBearPig.
[174:52.52]Jerma, it's probably weird hearing this with somebody on the internet, but you helped me overcome depression with how funny you are.
[174:58.72]Just want to say thanks for everything you've done.
[175:00.70]Even if you don't know you did it.
[175:06.09]Uh...
[175:08.66]Anytime somebody tells me that.
[175:11.56]Happens maybe once every couple weeks.
[175:17.48]Maybe like once a month.
[175:18.72]Somebody talks about their depression on the stream.
[175:22.68]And how this community and this stream has made it easier and fun and interesting for them.
[175:29.47]I can't even fucking respond.
[175:32.79]I can't believe it.
[175:36.69]I am so happy that you can have fucking fun here.
[175:41.89]You can forget about the bullshit of the daily life.
[175:44.43]You can come here and enjoy yourself with this community, with these people, and this stream.
[175:51.78]I will never fucking forget that.
[175:54.20]I will never fucking forget it.
[175:56.54]So, when somebody says something like this, it means a lot.
[176:04.65]It hits me to my very fucking core.
[176:10.33]I really, truly hope the best for you.
[176:12.25]I do.
[176:16.47]Thank you for the $15.
[176:17.27]Thanks for sticking around.
[176:18.51]Thanks for hanging out.
[176:28.82]I'm depressed that these fucking streams help the ever-living shit out of me.
[176:34.44]We got a great community here.
[176:36.16]We really do.
[176:38.62]Forget about, like, the meta in-joke stuff that people say.
[176:42.07]We all say it, right?
[176:44.55]But at its very, very core, this is a great, really great fucking community.
[176:49.77]So many people are so great here.
[176:52.90]I am so forever blessed with this group of people.
[177:00.50]Pin wrote a paper on this shit.
[177:02.76]We have like papers and like scientific documents based on this community.
[177:08.41]Do you understand?
[177:12.77]God, it means a fucking lot.
[177:14.17]I hope you fucking understand that.
[177:20.09]You guys have given me so much.
[177:23.05]I am completely grateful and forever happy that you can take something from here too.
[177:31.38]Goddamn.
[177:32.26]Like, I wish you the best.
[177:33.38]For real.
[177:38.98]There's a lot of great fucking people here.
[177:49.09]I wish there was more I could say.
[177:54.25]So much money, and so much happiness, and...
[177:58.76]and acceptance and fun and interesting things and interesting conversations happen here.
[178:04.44]I couldn't trade it for anything, even if I wanted to.
[178:08.13]It's impossible.
[178:09.65]I couldn't do that.
[178:12.75]There's so many great things.
[178:15.77]Look at the shit from fucking last week.
[178:17.65]Look at the game.
[178:18.67]Somebody made a video game about this community.
[178:22.80]It's like, what?
[178:24.58]It's unbelievable.
[178:27.40]Every fucking day.
[178:30.81]Don't think I don't think about this on a daily basis.
[178:38.82]Thank you for everything.
[178:39.74]Thanks for hanging out.
[178:40.52]I'm happy that you have a community, you have an outlet, you have something fun to do.
[178:48.45]And I'm going to keep doing it.
[178:49.79]I'm going to try to keep this community going.
[178:51.13]I'm going to keep doing things that I think are interesting, that I think are fun.
[178:55.66]If you want to ride the ride, I hope you do.
[178:58.31]If it's not for you, thanks for coming out anyways.
[179:02.50]Thanks for watching.
[179:05.40]Even if you don't think it's for you.
[179:08.06]Thank you for giving me even a fucking second of your goddamn time.
[179:17.81]For real.
[179:25.68]Uh, E-Dragon, thanks for the $5, E-Dragon.
[179:31.30]I wanted to give you $5 for my birthday, but now I think you should give it to Kim for that scare.
[179:37.14]I'll give it to Kim.
[179:40.34]DoorCube, thanks for the $2.50.
[179:41.64]This $2.50 is for Kim.
[179:42.84]She deserves it.
[179:43.46]I can't believe she was hiding in the fucking closet.
[179:45.14]That's insane.
[179:48.19]Kim will get it, for sure.
[179:49.91]Kim bits.
[179:52.83]Pika Banana, thanks for the $5, Pika.
[179:54.33]Kim is amazing.
[179:55.63]That was absolutely hilarious.
[179:56.96]Awesome stream as always.
[179:59.10]I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.
[180:00.22]Thanks for sticking around.
[180:04.90]Thank you.
[180:08.59]Wilma, thanks for the $2.52.
[180:09.71]Cheer, 52.
[180:09.89]No message.
[180:10.25]Thank you, Wilma.
[180:14.54]Unkind!
[180:16.26]Five dollars from Unkind.
[180:18.28]Hey, Jerma Babe, I had a really shitty day preparing for my trigonometry exam, but just popping in very quickly at the end of the stream and seeing you scream like a little girl made my day.
[180:31.45]jermaHeart.
[180:33.97]I wish you luck on your trigonometry exam.
[180:39.26]I'm glad you got some happiness from that.
[180:41.94]Thank you.
[180:44.45]Good luck.
[180:47.85]The scare was very real.
[180:49.19]I just, you don't know when you're in VR, the world closes in.
[180:54.99]Nothing else exists, you know?
[180:57.69]It's hard.
[181:00.61]Thank you, Unkind, though.
[181:02.01]Have a great exam.
[181:03.11]Hope you ace it.
[181:04.59]A minus.
[181:06.27]I'm not gonna give you the A plus here.
[181:10.70]Kim's the perfect match for you.
[181:12.12]You two are the only people I know who would be willing to stand in a closet for half an hour for a prank.
[181:16.58]She's great.
[181:17.04]She puts up with all my bullshit.
[181:20.94]If you find a girl or a guy, wherever, doesn't matter.
[181:24.18]I will put up with your fucking bullshit.
[181:27.47]She's great.
[181:28.13]She's fun.
[181:30.27]She means everything to me, so.
[181:32.27]It's great.
[181:38.03]That's for real.
[181:40.09]If you get a human, take him.
[181:43.15]Hold on to those that you love.
[181:48.94]My sunflower seed block.
[181:50.58]What a champ, huh?
[181:54.22]How does one find that?
[181:55.60]Accidentally go to a Christmas party and meet somebody and accidentally hang out with them.
[181:59.13]That's what happened to me.
[182:02.45]That's it.
[182:04.07]Sometimes shit just happens.
[182:05.29]You can't plan for it, guys.
[182:08.29]You'll never know.
[182:10.56]It just happens.
[182:11.98]I was single for like seven years.
[182:14.38]It just fucking happens sometimes.
[182:18.01]I would be the last person to tell you that that was gonna happen.
[182:25.49]It was Burgah Boy's Christmas party.
[182:27.59]Well, nah, that's not true.
[182:30.30]It was a Christmas party I went to with Burgah Boy.
[182:33.38]She was just there.
[182:38.60]Just be approachable.
[182:40.46]Be yourself.
[182:46.52]Tinder update.
[182:48.24]No matches.
[182:48.98]That's it.
[182:50.19]No matches.
[182:51.79]That Tinder shit was depressing.
[182:53.19]Tinder sucks.
[182:54.61]Delete that fucking app.
[182:56.33]Don't use that app.
[182:57.29]That app is poison.
[182:58.65]Don't use it.
[183:06.86]Kim, that's amazing.
[183:08.32]Thank you.
[183:14.05]Okay, Cupid.
[183:19.11]Just be yourself and just try.
[183:22.18]That's all you can do.
[183:29.92]Uh, but error of paradox, thanks for the three bucks.
[183:32.87]Frank or Zee, that's a dog.
[183:35.11]Thank you, three dollars.
[183:36.89]Error of paradox again, 250.
[183:38.97]Jerma, I'm going to Vegas for my 21st birthday.
[183:41.87]Can we please do the level up lounge thing?
[183:44.52]It'd be the best birthday ever.
[183:45.58]Uh, it's probably gonna take a while for me to get that going, but I want to do that.
[183:52.04]People want to do a meetup.
[183:55.71]And, hey, you're going to be at TwitchCon, and I don't want you guys to fucking stand at a goddamn line.
[184:01.83]Waiting for my signature.
[184:03.69]Like a fucking Disney World ride.
[184:06.23]No, fuck that.
[184:08.58]We're throwing a fucking party.
[184:11.02]You understand?
[184:13.82]Oh, hey, welcome to the fucking meetup.
[184:15.44]Here, here's your signature.
[184:16.38]Bye.
[184:17.82]No, fuck that shit.
[184:22.41]I ain't doing like a TwitchCon standing fucking line meetup.
[184:30.03]Some people have to do that because they have so many people.
[184:33.67]And I understand.
[184:35.85]But if I'm able to rent out a place... Fuck it, let's do it.
[184:41.03]Let's just have fun.
[184:42.57]Anybody's invited?
[184:43.31]21 over.
[184:44.85]Let me see what I can do.
[184:49.95]JermaCon.
[184:50.89]No, it'll be a lot smaller than that.
[184:54.11]We can like trickle into the casino and just dick around for a little while.
[184:57.01]Put like fucking 20 bucks on a double zero.
[185:00.14]Why not?
[185:00.54]Fuck it, let's do it.
[185:03.16]I'm down.
[185:04.22]Should be fun.
[185:04.68]21.
[185:14.22]Gotta be 21.
[185:15.13]And only like four people.
[185:18.37]You know what?
[185:19.43]If four people show up, then that's great.
[185:23.37]Thanks for coming.
[185:25.73]I will treat you like fucking royalty.
[185:31.47]If you decide to show up.
[185:33.93]Seriously.
[185:35.81]You guys don't even understand.
[185:41.86]When I went to TwitchCon, here's a quick little story.
[185:45.10]TwitchCon last year, or like two years ago, whenever it was in Long Beach, one person came to the meetup that I put on Twitter.
[185:56.19]It was RedRanger.
[185:57.29]RedRanger.
[185:59.07]Not sure if they're still around in the community or not, but regardless.
[186:03.75]That's who... We hung out for like fucking 45 minutes.
[186:12.04]I don't give a shit about how fucking many people are there, how big the line is, or policy.
[186:22.02]I don't give a shit.
[186:25.60]We sat and we fucking talked and we hung out for like a fucking hour.
[186:32.54]One person.
[186:34.80]I don't fucking care.
[186:38.18]That person watched the streams, cared about this content, cared about this community.
[186:46.73]I don't fucking care if one person, I don't care if fucking ten people, five people, I don't give a shit.
[186:52.57]One fucking person could go and it would like light up my life.
[186:55.81]I don't care.
[186:59.61]I don't give a shit about all that.
[187:01.33]I really don't.
[187:02.91]I hope you fucking know that.
[187:06.07]The one guy could show up that would be fucking great.
[187:09.63]We would have a blast.
[187:10.70]I would do karaoke.
[187:11.96]Who cares?
[187:14.90]If 200 people show up, I hope I can give you all attention.
[187:27.11]Do you mind if I get drunk as fuck?
[187:29.11]Get drunk as fuck!
[187:29.93]It's Vegas!
[187:30.55]It's Las Vegas, dude!
[187:35.64]What do you mean, do you care if I get drunk?
[187:37.32]It's Las Vegas, Nevada!
[187:41.24]Just be safe.
[187:42.90]Don't fucking drive.
[187:44.48]Don't do that shit.
[187:46.16]Get a Lyft, get an Uber to your Airbnb or hotel.
[187:48.77]The hotels are alright here!
[187:51.29]Get a room for like 30 bucks at fucking MGM.
[187:54.01]They're like nothing.
[188:00.18]Does the open bar have milkshakes?
[188:03.18]Maybe, it depends.
[188:05.95]Staying in an Airbnb in Vegas.
[188:15.57]But for real, I don't care if one person wants to say hello or a thousand.
[188:21.94]We've done meetups before.
[188:23.08]I don't do Twitch or like YouTube sponsored meetups.
[188:29.21]The last time I did one we just filled up a lobby and just hung out for like fucking two or three hours.
[188:38.26]I don't give a shit about that.
[188:42.46]I don't care about feeding people through a fucking goddamn line.
[188:49.80]And I might be talking shit right now.
[188:52.97]But whatever, I don't care.
[189:02.34]Deodorant is necessary.
[189:06.33]It is.
[189:06.73]Wear it.
[189:10.27]But!
[189:11.95]I'm not gonna stand on a soapbox anymore.
[189:17.04]If I do it, you'll know well in advance.
[189:26.60]But each and every fucking one of you has grown this channel, has stuck with this channel,
[189:33.67]So why wouldn't I value every fucking single one of you?
[189:39.11]The reason why... Oh, you had 4,500 fucking people watching?
[189:42.67]That's like top 10, top 20 on Twitch.
[189:44.59]Are you serious?
[189:47.15]What, like I'm not gonna give you the credit that you deserve for that?
[189:49.37]Are you serious?
[189:52.06]Like, that's such a huge fucking deal.
[189:57.92]A shitload of you make this channel as popular and as interesting as it is.
[190:04.22]never fucking forget that never ever fucking ever forget that ever oh look at me 2020 for me to get up here and like drink a bottle of wine
[190:32.06]And like, act out my dumb fucking skits.
[190:36.18]And you're watching.
[190:37.18]Like, I don't have anything else to tell you.
[190:41.85]It's remarkable that somebody would do that.
[190:46.95]But Superman, thanks for the $2.97.
[190:51.15]He's knocking shit over.
[190:52.05]No, that's an empty cup.
[190:54.20]Jerma, I got a vibe after seeing how much fun you were having with it.
[190:57.28]And I can't stop playing Beat Saber.
[190:58.66]What a great game, by the way.
[191:01.18]Also, my stepbrother and I are going to Vegas next week.
[191:04.74]What's my favorite places you've been to?
[191:07.23]And where do you want to go?
[191:08.51]Best wishes.
[191:10.45]Well, I told you my favorite casino is the Aria.
[191:14.71]It's just that everything's in the Aria.
[191:16.33]I love the Aria.
[191:19.25]Downtown Vegas is great.
[191:22.57]You get to Fremont Street for real.
[191:25.05]It's a great place.
[191:26.35]A lot of good pizza.
[191:27.87]Evil Knievel's got great pizza.
[191:30.87]Aria.
[191:31.39]The Aria.
[191:32.23]Like this, right?
[191:34.19]The Aria.
[191:35.69]Like that.
[191:38.90]There you go.
[191:39.80]The Aria.
[191:42.70]If you want to walk the Strip, it takes about two plus hours to walk the whole thing.
[191:46.30]So just the whole thing.
[191:48.58]I've had a few glasses of wine.
[191:49.78]Give me a break.
[191:54.01]Takes about two hours to walk the whole thing.
[191:57.41]Wouldn't recommend it, stay somewhere.
[192:01.62]Go to Hash House Agogo at The Link.
[192:05.22]The Link is, I mean, the casino's alright, and the drinks are alright, and the place is alright, but Hash House Agogo at The Link has the best cheeseburger I have ever eaten.
[192:17.39]It is the best I have ever consumed in my entire 34 years on the planet.
[192:22.54]Hash House of GoGo.
[192:23.88]Fucking go there and eat their food.
[192:25.16]It's fantastic.
[192:27.08]That is not sponsored.
[192:28.04]It's just real life.
[192:29.40]It's just real life, okay?
[192:35.36]It's great.
[192:36.44]They do like a lace burger.
[192:37.74]They flatten it out.
[192:38.64]Oh, I want to go there right now.
[192:41.91]It's just fucking reality.
[192:50.23]Streamer condones hash consumption.
[192:53.36]Well, if it's a hash house, a go-go, then yeah.
[192:58.08]But thank you, Superman.
[192:59.48]Hope you have fun in Vegas.
[193:01.71]Enjoy it.
[193:02.83]Just don't let it consume you.
[193:05.15]There's a lot to do in Vegas.
[193:07.31]Just be responsible.
[193:09.59]Hazy, thanks for the five dollars.
[193:10.83]They said shave.
[193:12.29]I will in a few days.
[193:14.92]Internet Jorge, $15, Internet Jorge.
[193:17.10]If JermaCon actually happens, summer would be awesome since I'm off and can request work off.
[193:23.10]Jerma, I'm challenging you to drink off.
[193:25.73]I read that so wrong.
[193:28.17]It's not going to be JermaCon.
[193:30.19]I don't want my name in that shit.
[193:32.29]I'd rather it be like the Hangout Session or something.
[193:38.74]I don't know.
[193:39.72]JermaCon sounds a little pretentious.
[193:47.53]I'm gonna get in touch with MGM, I really am.
[193:50.49]I swear to God, this is real.
[193:54.90]Grillmastercon, if you can make it, if it happens, I'll talk about it a lot more.
[194:02.24]21 plus, we'll see if I can get a private party.
[194:05.44]It'll be fun.
[194:08.37]Thanks for the 15 bucks.
[194:11.53]Something or utter.
[194:13.42]Thanks for the $2.50.
[194:14.31]Can't wait for JermaCon.
[194:15.37]Hope you can handle your liquor better at the open bar.
[194:17.67]I'm good.
[194:19.79]Thank you Bingo Sunshine for the $15.
[194:21.39]I'm gonna charge back these bits if you don't stream tomorrow.
[194:28.19]Come on.
[194:33.62]I might... God damn it.
[194:38.42]I'll try.
[194:38.94]I didn't think I was gonna drink this much wine.
[194:43.78]I might have to fuckin' sleep tomorrow.
[194:45.90]What a fuckin' asshole.
[194:51.06]Hey, I took three days off!
[194:52.58]Oh, what, is this like an eight-hour stream?
[194:54.46]Ah, see ya in a few days!
[194:56.00]I'm gonna take another few days off!
[195:02.60]Goddammit.
[195:08.73]I appreciate the fact that people really, for the most part, they don't care.
[195:17.43]The more that you guys understand, the more that I can do the things that I want to do.
[195:20.96]You understand?
[195:25.60]We talked about it a lot.
[195:27.18]I don't have like a schedule.
[195:28.32]I don't want a schedule.
[195:30.54]I want to just do it whenever, you know?
[195:33.09]Whenever I'm fucking happy.
[195:35.33]Which is a lot, right?
[195:38.29]I never want to force myself or push myself to do things I don't really necessarily want to do, right?
[195:49.74]I've been doing this for a long time.
[195:55.74]I hope you understand that every single fucking time I press that start stream... Every time.
[196:01.82]Every.
[196:02.52]Single.
[196:03.22]Fucking.
[196:03.80]Time.
[196:05.42]That I press that start streaming button on OBS, I want you to have as much fun as possible.
[196:12.86]So if somebody says, oh, you took like three or four days off, I just know that I want to make sure every stream is fucking good and fun for you.
[196:24.76]And sometimes I have to take that time.
[196:30.26]I was like that on YouTube.
[196:31.58]Maybe I don't stream as much as other people do, but that's just kind of the way I work.
[196:41.11]He's getting sentimental again.
[196:42.73]No, you guys fucking get it.
[196:45.17]You really do.
[196:45.71]You guys fucking get it.
[196:53.08]An actor.
[196:54.44]No.
[196:57.86]I couldn't ask for a fucking better life.
[196:59.88]And a better group of fucking people.
[197:02.55]That get it, you know.
[197:06.13]God damn.
[197:08.15]If only you guys knew.
[197:12.11]I say it a lot and we've been talking about it for a long time tonight.
[197:16.73]But my god.
[197:26.01]Just wait.
[197:26.71]Wait.
[197:27.89]Another few weeks.
[197:30.82]I got a lot of stuff planned.
[197:40.00]Thank you.
[197:41.66]It feels good to be funny and I finally found someone who can make me laugh.
[197:45.14]I feel you.
[197:48.18]Never change.
[197:48.64]The Lord knows we need more loving and well-meaning people.
[197:52.79]Like yourself.
[197:54.07]Providing just a bunch of laughs and much needed.
[197:58.87]I just want to have a good time.
[198:01.57]That's all I care about, you know?
[198:04.24]In a world that's so fucking crazy.
[198:06.30]We live in like a crazy fucking world.
[198:08.28]The world is crazy.
[198:13.55]In a society, in this society.
[198:20.76]This is as much of an outlet for me as it is for you.
[198:25.90]I hope you understand that.
[198:27.96]This is the Joker backstory.
[198:31.14]We live in a society where if you're fucking good at something, never do it for free.
[198:36.79]Fucking trees regrowing.
[198:42.52]I'll never be the biggest streamer.
[198:43.78]I'll never be the fucking most respected streamer.
[198:46.34]Maybe.
[198:47.92]But I got you guys.
[198:49.32]I got this fucking group of people.
[198:52.22]Y'all get this shit.
[198:53.22]Y'all understand.
[198:54.70]I don't need anything anymore.
[198:56.00]I don't need anything else.
[198:58.75]I got a fucking group of funny fucking people.
[199:02.69]I don't give a fuck about anything else.
[199:04.43]Are you kidding me?
[199:06.29]You think I give a shit about being, like, the most popular?
[199:10.05]I've got to make sure my post gets 20,000 thumbs up.
[199:14.73]I don't give a fuck.
[199:18.37]Holy shit.
[199:19.70]I don't care at all.
[199:22.36]Hopefully this video can get 10,000 likes.
[199:26.06]Please give... No.
[199:29.22]I don't give a flying fuck about that.
[199:38.48]Fuck that.
[199:40.58]Let's just have fun.
[199:43.28]I'm getting worried about him.
[199:44.54]No, don't.
[199:45.54]Don't, don't, don't, don't.
[199:51.98]Wine gives him the pot.
[199:53.20]I'm not going to swear for the rest of the stream.
[199:56.44]I promise.
[199:57.64]Not one more time.
[200:03.15]Hey, Thievius!
[200:04.21]Thanks for the five dollars.
[200:07.94]I'm glad I got to catch your stream today.
[200:09.32]It has honestly been one of my favorites.
[200:11.56]Hope you play more VR horror games.
[200:14.20]I had a relationship end the other day.
[200:17.00]And this really helped my mood.
[200:19.04]It was only about a month long or so.
[200:21.57]So I'm not completely torn.
[200:23.25]But it was still rough since I'm dealing with college finals.
[200:26.57]Just wanted you to know that I appreciate your streams.
[200:28.45]Thanks for a great stream.
[200:30.25]To my heart.
[200:35.56]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[200:40.33]The one thing you can take from that, though, is if it was a month long, it was, you know, you figured out that it wasn't to be, and you moved on.
[200:51.89]You're gonna bounce back.
[200:54.53]Just don't worry about it.
[200:57.15]There's tons of other people in the ocean.
[200:59.99]Just go diving, you know?
[201:02.85]Don't worry about that.
[201:04.59]Thankfully, you didn't figure that out two or three years later.
[201:07.93]Right?
[201:13.61]Tons of people are drowning.
[201:15.17]I got my snorkel.
[201:25.08]But... Thievus.
[201:27.30]Thievius.
[201:28.70]I wish you the best.
[201:31.04]Don't let it break you up too much.
[201:33.62]Thanks for hanging out, thanks for the five dollars.
[201:36.72]Oh, Zalasky, thanks for the three bucks.
[201:38.52]Alright, look here, Boomer.
[201:40.42]Olive Chat wants 2012 beef cake, bleh.
[201:44.24]Beefcake Jermaback, take him out of the closet.
[201:47.72]I'll never be that fucking Jack.
[201:50.50]Guys, I spent every other day in the gym.
[201:54.51]I, ah, that was a swear.
[201:56.13]You're right.
[201:58.19]I was lifting four days a week.
[202:01.61]Oh, it took a 10, 20, it took like 20 hours a week of my time.
[202:08.53]Alright.
[202:10.28]At Jexpo, at Jerma Jexcon 2019, I will bench press 240 pounds.
[202:18.38]Why did I say that?
[202:20.51]I hope somebody can help me.
[202:23.61]At Jexcon 2019,
[202:30.15]I will bench press like 100 pounds and somebody can help me.
[202:33.82]We're gonna have to need a spotter for that one.
[202:39.74]It's gonna be live streamed.
[202:42.06]Jexcon 2019 for the Level Up Lounge.
[202:44.92]Alright, I gotta stop saying that.
[202:47.10]Because that's not true.
[202:49.60]And somebody at MGM might be like, that's not fucking happening, dude.
[202:52.60]Like, don't say that shit.
[202:55.34]But, hey!
[202:56.06]Maybe it will.
[202:59.80]Maybe it will.
[203:01.56]Swear.
[203:02.58]Ah, it's alright.
[203:05.70]Hey, Broluck, thanks for the three bucks.
[203:07.36]They say nice hair.
[203:08.54]Nice hair.
[203:09.24]What is it?
[203:13.11]This is nice hair, apparently.
[203:15.09]Let's find out what this means.
[203:22.81]Okay.
[203:23.96]What is it?
[203:30.91]What's wrong with it?
[203:35.28]What is it?
[203:42.54]Well, I don't, I don't, what's, I don't get it.
[203:47.81]Nice hair.
[203:49.85]What's wrong with my hair?
[203:54.73]Okay.
[203:57.77]Thanks.
[203:59.07]Thanks, I guess.
[204:00.13]Okay.
[204:08.47]Alright.
[204:11.37]Thank you, Broluck.
[204:15.07]JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR thanks to 250.
[204:18.15]Plebs can't jermaVenus, though.
[204:21.87]If they sub, they can.
[204:25.09]But you can jermaVenus for them.
[204:29.25]Thank you.
[204:30.65]Skelly Boner.
[204:32.79]Oh, I read that.
[204:35.99]You are honestly a huge inspiration in my life.
[204:41.19]I look up to you so much and I truly hope my future turns out as good as it has for you.
[204:47.12]You're one of the most genuine and loving people on the entire internet.
[204:50.84]And don't change.
[204:54.32]If you look up to me, I hope you can take a couple of things.
[204:59.76]Try your best.
[205:01.62]Try to make as many people happy as you can.
[205:04.20]And
[205:06.74]Be realistic about your goals.
[205:09.52]Try your fucking best.
[205:11.72]Do what you can.
[205:13.52]And try to make as many people happy as you can.
[205:16.74]You only get one chance.
[205:17.99]You got one life here.
[205:19.97]Try to do your best.
[205:21.95]Just do your fucking best.
[205:27.81]Obey your thirst.
[205:28.79]Yeah.
[205:32.21]It's a symbiotic relationship.
[205:34.09]So thank you.
[205:34.59]Mithril Bong, thanks for $5.10 Mithril.
[205:36.97]And they say...
[205:57.15]You can't win them all though, laughing my ass off.
[206:00.46]Keep it up, you're 35 and haven't peaked yet.
[206:02.66]You'll figure something out.
[206:04.08]I have not even peaked.
[206:06.06]As Dennis Reynolds says, I haven't peaked yet, come on.
[206:09.72]I'll peak when I'm 45.
[206:10.64]You know how much shit is coming up in the summertime?
[206:14.83]You think I've peaked?
[206:16.07]Don't even, oh my god, you have no fucking idea.
[206:19.23]I'm gonna get in a goddamn clown costume and sit in a dunk tank.
[206:22.05]And you guys are gonna control a fucking pitching machine to dunk me.
[206:25.26]You think I've peaked?
[206:26.72]Ah, see you in a few months.
[206:27.86]Not even, like, a few weeks.
[206:29.28]Fucking whatever it is.
[206:30.56]Oh my god, are you serious?
[206:33.84]I'm the golden goddamn god!
[206:36.61]Remember that.
[206:42.50]All Mew, thanks for the three bucks.
[206:44.88]Say it was the suit, Peter.
[206:46.72]It was the goblin, so that I can go to bed.
[206:50.05]Hope he can go to bed now.
[206:57.14]Jacket-a-mic!
[206:59.11]Thanks for five bucks.
[207:00.95]Your butterfly effect is insane.
[207:03.99]So many people go through life just hoping to make a difference in the world.
[207:07.03]But you've done it.
[207:08.29]Thousands of people here plan our nights around you because you make us happy.
[207:12.61]And it helps us get through tough times.
[207:15.25]You're a gift to humanity as a whole and we thank you tremendously.
[207:20.25]Give yourself some credit.
[207:25.34]As they say in Game of Thrones, the night is dark and full of terrors.
[207:29.64]But give yourself some credit.
[207:32.74]Right?
[207:36.73]-2 game.
[207:37.67]Come on!
[207:38.23]It's coming back in like a week.
[207:39.53]Give me that one.
[207:45.15]Thousands of people plan their nights around you.
[207:49.52]But you do understand that I plan my nights around all of you.
[207:54.56]You know?
[207:58.98]It goes both ways.
[208:02.27]So, I plan a lot of my nights around you guys.
[208:07.49]You know, I want the streams to be fun, I want you guys to have a good time.
[208:11.82]And if you're saying that, it's a complete symbiotic, I'm the hippopotamus and you're like the hippo bird that eats the fucking bugs.
[208:21.24]You know?
[208:21.72]Or you're the hippo and I'm the bird that eats the bugs.
[208:25.05]We are in this together.
[208:27.59]Forever.
[208:28.55]So don't you ever leave.
[208:29.65]Don't ever leave me.
[208:33.35]That was kind of a bad... It's alright.
[208:36.05]I'll see you soon.
[208:40.37]Chat doesn't know.
[208:41.89]The hippo bird.
[208:43.06]I don't know.
[208:43.66]Whatever the bird's name is.
[208:45.60]The hippo birdimus.
[208:47.18]Doesn't matter.
[208:51.98]Streamer forces...
[208:55.94]But if I have a butterfly effect on you, I hope you take something positive from the stream.
[209:01.74]We fuck around a lot.
[209:02.90]Look, we fuck around all the time.
[209:07.45]But if you take something from the stream and you take something, inspiration or positivity or helpfulness or community, it doesn't matter.
[209:16.94]That's such a big fucking deal.
[209:21.91]When I go to bed every night, I will lie in my bed.
[209:26.27]I'll stare at the ceiling.
[209:28.08]And a lot of times I just think about this world that I live in now and this community.
[209:35.98]And I'm living in Las Vegas in a nice place.
[209:40.91]And what I've been given, right?
[209:44.59]You sleep, I don't sleep on my back.
[209:45.97]I fucking think on my back.
[209:47.35]I sleep on my side.
[209:51.93]So whatever you tell me that I've given you, always remember what you've given me.
[209:58.62]You give me that opportunity to lie on my fucking back in Las Vegas and be like, holy, I'm in fucking Las Vegas.
[210:05.76]In like a nice place, in a nice area, and... I fucking can pay my rent!
[210:12.94]I...
[210:15.12]What?! !
[210:17.38]That's why I take this shit so damn seriously.
[210:19.18]Like, I take fun and this community so seriously.
[210:26.61]I think about this shit all the goddamn time.
[210:31.25]Paying rent?
[210:32.15]Pogchant.
[210:32.89]Yeah.
[210:34.65]I thought you bought- Nah, I don't own in Las Vegas.
[210:36.87]It was too quick.
[210:40.47]Our vessel.
[210:43.11]No, but it's true.
[210:46.79]Think about that.
[210:47.45]Think about the thousands of fucking people.
[210:49.19]Think about the thousands of you that have decided to fucking pay money to this stream.
[210:55.82]It's not a joke.
[210:58.40]It's not funny to me.
[211:02.88]It's a lot.
[211:04.06]It's a huge amount of people.
[211:08.36]It's a community of people.
[211:11.05]I can't even fucking comprehend sometimes.
[211:17.53]What else do you want me to do with spare cash?
[211:19.11]I just hope you think it's worth it.
[211:26.05]Yeah, I've had a few drinks, but you guys have heard this before.
[211:29.15]I will never change my tune on this.
[211:31.18]Ever.
[211:33.12]Doesn't matter how many subs come into this channel, how many bits come into this fucking channel.
[211:37.74]I will never change this tune.
[211:41.18]And if I do, tell me about it.
[211:45.64]If I ever change this shit, if I ever start acting a different fucking way, start acting like, oh, I deserve this.
[211:53.40]I deserve something.
[211:54.96]Keep me fucking grounded.
[211:56.04]I hope you do.
[211:57.86]Because it keeps the community fucking churning.
[212:09.35]Your tune is raw.
[212:15.58]You don't strike me as the type?
[212:16.86]I hope I don't.
[212:20.16]I hope I don't.
[212:20.86]I hope you guys think that I do this because I want to.
[212:24.00]Otherwise, what, would I stream fucking six, seven days a week?
[212:28.55]Every stream is turned on because I want to turn it on.
[212:30.61]That's all there is to it.
[212:37.97]And it's never gonna fucking change.
[212:43.75]Don't ever let me change.
[212:44.93]5,000 subs.
[212:48.07]10,000 subs.
[212:49.07]20,000.
[212:49.37]I don't fucking care.
[212:52.81]Never let the dynamic change.
[212:55.68]Otherwise, I've failed.
[212:58.64]And why I started in the first place is moot.
[213:02.90]Don't let me fucking do that.
[213:11.47]I really fucking mean that.
[213:13.56]That's for real.
[213:14.70]That's actually coming out of my... I'll... We'll turn the camera on.
[213:18.94]Ooh.
[213:20.04]Maybe I shouldn't have done that.
[213:27.75]Here.
[213:28.33]Clip this one.
[213:29.27]Don't... No.
[213:30.17]Never mind.
[213:33.97]Jesus Christ.
[213:40.06]That's all I'm gonna say.
[213:41.08]I'm gonna move on from that.
[213:41.90]I know it might be about fucking rambling, but drunk man's thoughts are sober man's, um, thoughts, too, because they're the same person.
[213:49.57]And what the hell does that even saying mean?
[213:51.55]You're gonna say the same goddamn thing.
[213:54.43]Whatever that fucking saying is, you've heard it.
[214:02.70]You look worn out.
[214:03.54]I'm not, though.
[214:07.90]I'm just fucking terrible.
[214:10.70]Uh, Skellyboner, thanks for the $1.
[214:12.26]Oh, that's supposed to be reading these!
[214:14.36]That's supposed to be reading these!
[214:17.34]But thank you.
[214:18.84]Oh, Mew, thanks for $5.
[214:21.56]Look, Jerma, I really need you to do me a favor.
[214:23.47]What's the favor?
[214:25.07]You didn't say what the favor was.
[214:28.59]You just gave me $5, which is a fucking shitload of money.
[214:32.19]You gave me a $5 bill.
[214:34.25]I don't know, what's the favor?
[214:37.87]Jerma lied about Steam Legends.
[214:39.40]You never came back.
[214:40.46]You never came back.
[214:41.46]What do you mean?
[214:47.86]What did I say?
[214:51.38]I'll come back in an hour and a half and I'll do it.
[214:54.96]I'm gonna go eat some food.
[214:57.86]I'll do it in an hour and a half.
[215:00.84]Do what?
[215:02.93]I'll do what in an hour and a half?
[215:07.96]I don't know what this means.
[215:11.74]I don't know what I'm lying about.
[215:12.94]What was I supposed to do?
[215:15.52]What was I supposed to do?
[215:19.23]Oh shit!
[215:20.97]The loot!
[215:21.73]I never came back.
[215:23.81]I never gave... I never came back and gave the loot.
[215:28.71]Oh god.
[215:29.19]Wow, I never did.
[215:31.29]Holy shit.
[215:32.39]What a terrible person.
[215:34.11]Yeah, I was supposed to do that.
[215:37.76]Oh my god, I'm so scatterbrained, I'm so sorry.
[215:42.98]We'll do it tonight.
[215:48.10]Thank you Dorkube for the 250.
[215:50.50]If you still decide JermaCon is a good idea after you leave the VR stupor, just be careful how you plan it.
[215:57.00]You have to consider how to handle what could possibly be a large group of people following you for hours.
[216:04.17]No, that's fine.
[216:06.13]We would go to the Level Up Lounge in the MGM Casino.
[216:10.15]Beautiful casino.
[216:12.73]21+.
[216:14.33]I'd make it work.
[216:14.89]It would be fun.
[216:20.60]We'll do karaoke.
[216:21.50]I'll sing like fucking Walkin' in Memphis or some dumb shit.
[216:26.78]No, I'm gonna play this by the book.
[216:28.98]So don't worry about that.
[216:33.91]Level, you're so dead set on Level Up Lounge.
[216:37.25]I know, it sounds sponsored, but it's not.
[216:39.67]The place is just cool.
[216:43.02]Don't, it's not gonna be like that.
[216:45.20]Don't compare me.
[216:46.56]I'm uncomparable.
[216:47.98]I am an uncomparable streamer.
[216:49.82]Do not compare me to other streamers.
[216:52.78]As you can tell by my fucking Twitch docs.
[216:55.34]Let's take a look and see how good they're doing.
[216:59.66]Don't compare me to other streamers.
[217:01.08]Let's see how my Twitch stocks are doing here.
[217:03.40]Let's see.
[217:04.12]Trending.
[217:05.64]Is Jerma985 currently trending?
[217:07.76]He's not.
[217:09.06]There he is.
[217:09.56]There he is.
[217:10.48]Okay.
[217:12.34]A little bit of a dump.
[217:13.58]A little bit of a dump.
[217:16.18]Okay.
[217:17.58]People have sold.
[217:18.80]People have sold a little bit.
[217:20.46]That's okay.
[217:21.86]You gotta cool off after a big gain like we've seen.
[217:28.44]But yeah, don't worry.
[217:29.72]Whatever the meetup will be, it'll be a never... Maybe I'll stream it.
[217:36.66]If I can get permission from the Level Up Lounge in MGM Casino, maybe I'll stream the whole fucking thing.
[217:45.57]Somebody said, Jesus, this guy is wasted.
[217:47.31]No, Vance, I'm not.
[217:48.97]You joined at a weird time.
[217:52.17]God damn it.
[217:55.36]How do I tell that person I'm not?
[217:57.22]How do I tell this person I'm not wasted?
[217:58.68]God damn it.
[218:00.42]I'll see.
[218:04.70]Hey, well, you're right.

[220:31.87]I'm 5'8".

[220:34.39]Dorkube, thanks for the 250.

[220:44.02]You watch this every day.
[221:03.08]It was fucking... What a joke.
[221:16.14]I fucking love the internet.
[221:21.11]Hey, welcome to the stream.
[221:22.23]If that person's still here, I hope you followed.

[221:32.16]Oh, well, then, um... I'm glad.
[221:38.21]I can't believe I lost, like, fucking a thousand people during that, like, singing thing.
[221:42.67]Uh, I'm gonna look at that clip tomorrow, that stream tomorrow, and be like, Ugh, what the fuck was I doing?
[221:52.25]Who cares?
[221:52.87]Whatever.
[221:53.23]Fuck it, it's all in good fun.
[221:55.83]He hates his new viewers!
[221:57.21]What?! !
[221:59.10]post the fight.
[222:02.72]I may have turned away a few people today.
[222:10.94]If you're one of the people that stayed after all that, hey, here's some of the best fucking twitch.tv content you could find.
[222:19.01]A fucking 5.8 troll screams at bad technology and gets mad at bugs and games and it makes a cringy fucking 13 second bit.
[222:29.16]I hope you had fun.
[222:35.34]And finally, Frost Troll.
[222:40.25]Thanks for the five bucks.

[222:52.79]Thank you.
[222:53.09]What a fucking blast.
[222:53.75]I loved it.
[222:55.53]Tonight was great.

[223:09.52]I'll see you all soon.
[223:10.54]I can't... I mean, I'm supposed to stream tomorrow.

[223:15.36]And then we're gonna have to... We'll see.
[223:18.36]I don't know.
[223:19.12]I love you.
[223:20.54]I'll see you guys fucking real soon.

[223:28.39]Take care.
[223:29.43]Have a great one.
[223:50.20]Oh God, I forgot about the stream legends.
[223:52.36]You're right.

[224:15.69]Open it up if you have it.
[224:18.03]If you play it.
[224:19.49]It's just a little fun thing to have down there.
[224:21.15]It's free.
[224:21.49]You don't have to pay anything.
[224:23.95]It's just there.
[224:32.51]Here we go.
[224:36.38]I will see you guys real soon.
[224:38.94]What?

[224:41.14]Oh, there we go.
[224:42.80]Three, two, one.
[224:44.66]Gift's gone out.
[224:45.94]Hope you got something good.
