[00:07.58]Hey James, what are you doing here?
[00:09.66]You're not trying to take this ship and leave the orphanage again, are you?
[00:12.50]What kind of pirate would you be if you didn't have a first mate?
[00:15.04]Every great pirate needs someone to help manage their loot.
[00:17.57]Let me be that guy.
[00:19.01]From now on, you're Captain James and I'll be your first mate.
[00:22.59]Phew, the guard fell for it.
[00:25.23]Aye aye, Captain.
[00:26.87]Yeah!
[00:27.61]We sure showed them!
[00:29.25]Yes, Captain!
[00:30.55]I found some batteries in a defense matrix!
[00:32.81]Awesome!
[00:33.79]A defense matrix protects our ship.
[00:35.71]The defense matrix can also repair itself automatically.
[00:38.63]Let's install it on the frigate right away.
[00:40.56]We're going to need to recruit some other crew members to help run the ship as well.
[00:43.70]The orphanage isn't important anymore.
[00:45.50]Right now we need money and a lot of it.
[00:47.58]The planets here in Galactic Union 20 lost everything during the war.
[00:51.02]Those Sphinx Empire bastards are still rolling in money, though.
[00:54.50]Let me take a look at how much ores are going for.
[00:57.16]Can you see that the MACD and RSI of plutonium suggest a very strong buy signal?
[01:02.50]I've never seen such strong signal since I started trading at the age of 12.
[01:07.01]Yes, spend everything we have!
[01:09.19]Well, nothing certain.
[01:11.09]If it starts going downhill, I guess we can pull up from the market and find something else.
[01:15.77]We need to go to the other starports to sell.
[01:18.09]Our computer can't tell us how much each good is selling for.
[01:20.63]We can only check the prices of the markets.
[01:22.78]Yeah, I can see why.
[01:24.18]There's tons of people here.
[01:25.73]It's a level two market, so there must be some good deals here.
[01:29.31]James, we can sell our loot here for some quick money.
[01:32.12]The Hydrito system has some markets as well.
[01:34.30]Maybe we can find some deals there too.
[01:36.50]Hmm.
[01:38.01]Yes.
[01:39.43]Take a look at this.
[01:40.64]There's unstable radioactivity going on in this sector.
[01:43.88]Why can't we just take the long way to Hydrido?
[01:46.30]The radioactivity is really unstable and I don't want to be fried before I become rich.
[01:51.40]Fine.
[01:52.41]But we should be careful.
[01:53.93]We're near the anomaly.
[01:55.21]We shouldn't get any closer.
[01:56.81]It's huge.
[01:58.41]The Empire?
[01:59.07]They're not welcome here.
[02:01.01]Damn it.
[02:01.83]There's Sphinx frigates coming out.
[02:03.37]They found us.
[02:04.69]James, we have an incoming communication request from the Sphinx ship.
[02:08.05]James, what were they doing here in the GU?
[02:10.73]What would make them want to take our people as slaves?
[02:13.77]So why are slaves being taken again?
[02:16.08]Having a pirate call the authorities?
[02:19.20]Irony aside, we should move.
[02:20.60]We're probably wanted men for stealing this ship already.
[02:23.90]And I don't want to be locked up for the rest of my life.
[02:26.38]Okay, set a course for Port Marzi, then.
[02:28.98]You know, I hear that Emma Rose is holding a concert in Jupiter.
[02:33.55]I dreamt about her last night.
[02:35.46]She held my hand and we kissed under the stars.
[02:39.06]I... I just want to shake her hand.
[02:41.72]Excuse me, I'd like two front row tickets to Emma's concert.
[02:45.52]Are you kidding?
[02:46.49]We came all the way from Zaladas to see your show.
[02:49.23]Is it money you want?
[02:50.35]Name your price and I'll get it.
[02:52.09]You want me to calm down?
[02:53.61]How am I supposed to calm down?
[02:55.13]My poor Emma is sick and there's nothing I can do about it.
[02:58.75]A lot of people paid to see this concert.
[03:00.73]Emma just bailing like that would cause the organizers to go bankrupt.
[03:04.24]Well, what are we waiting for?
[03:05.42]Let's find out why.
[03:06.90]Yeah.
[03:07.62]You can take this money and keep quiet.
[03:10.00]Answers.
[03:10.94]What's the real reason Emma's concert got canceled?
[03:13.38]There's no way she got sick.
[03:15.19]Any other clues about the kidnappers?
[03:17.37]There's no time to waste.
[03:18.45]We have to save Emma.
[03:21.17]I'll be her knight in shining armor.
[03:23.92]Who cares why?
[03:25.14]We need to save her.
[03:26.70]A fleet of Sphinx transport ships.
[03:29.42]Just like the one carrying the slaves.
[03:31.28]You don't think they're related, do you?
[03:33.09]That's what heroes do, isn't it?
[03:35.27]But say, I'm your number one fan.
[03:38.15]Would you... Would you shake my hand?
[03:41.61]James puts on a straight face, but I know for a fact he wants to meet him someday.
[03:45.99]Don't worry.
[03:47.09]I'm sure there's some other reason.
[03:48.98]James, we have an incoming communication request from Commander Lin.
[03:54.00]Commander, mercenaries don't come cheap, you know.
[03:58.85]Why is he taking her from me?
[04:02.01]James, we're getting an encoded communication request.
[04:05.13]Want me to put you through?
[04:06.51]What are you good at?
[04:07.69]He's right.
[04:08.61]Plutonium-244's price is rising quickly.
[04:11.25]If we don't invest now, it might be too late to do so later.
[04:14.29]We should go to Karanerkin's market right away and verify it.
[04:17.26]The market doesn't care.
[04:18.74]Once people see an opportunity to become rich, they start to go crazy.
[04:22.14]If we want to make some more money, we need to invest in it too.
[04:25.60]Alright, leave it to me.
[04:27.62]Ugh, get a room, you two.
[04:30.00]James may not be hurt, but I've been seriously wounded.
[04:33.98]Fine, fine.
[04:35.86]And done.
[04:37.48]The plutonium market's going crazy.
[04:39.98]This is such easy money.
[04:41.74]The investment bubble will crash sooner or later, though, so we should be cautious and invest wisely.
[04:46.70]Opening a secure channel.
[04:49.28]And done.
[04:50.42]There's an incoming communication request from Commander Lin.
[04:53.64]We'd be in less danger if you gave us money to upgrade our ship.
[04:57.65]Tell me something I don't know.
[04:59.49]Moi moi, do you want to come along with us?
[05:01.99]We could use a pet around here.
[05:04.51]Nothing.
[05:05.55]It's really weird.
[05:07.30]Incoming communication from the commander.
[05:09.62]If that happens, the plutonium market will crash.
[05:12.46]And if the market crashes here, the Empire will be shaken by the enemy coming so close to home.
[05:17.04]They're going to retaliate.
[05:18.33]It'll be all-out war.
[05:20.06]There's no way I'm letting you and Emma go off alone.
[05:22.70]And hey, I'm your first mate, remember?
[05:25.10]I'll be by your side till the end.
[05:27.10]Let's short-sell plutonium and upgrade our ship first.
[05:30.06]It's gonna be a tough journey.
[05:32.15]That'll take about five minutes.
[05:34.89]And done.
[05:36.09]We're back.
[05:36.81]Let's get out of here.
[05:38.21]No, Emma!
[05:39.31]Damn it all!
[05:40.19]Bring her back to the ship.
[05:41.37]I'll cover you guys.
[05:42.50]You bastards are going to pay!
[05:44.80]We've unloaded all the gold onto Lin's ship, but I'm worried about Emma.
[05:49.30]There's an incoming communication request from the commander.
[05:53.43]Where are we supposed to go now?
[05:55.69]The Union betrayed us, we're wanted by the Empire, and Emma's badly hurt.
[06:01.08]I'm not sure if you're up for it, but we have an incoming communication request.
[06:05.44]The caller is unidentified.
[06:07.43]I'm not leaving your side.
[06:09.19]I'm your first mate to the end.
