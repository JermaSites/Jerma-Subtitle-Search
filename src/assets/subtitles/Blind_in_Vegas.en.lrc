[00:10.44]Thank you.
[01:57.34]Hello.
[02:01.40]Hey, look.
[02:03.12]It's Fallout.
[02:04.52]Fallout New Vegas, a game I've never played.
[02:08.76]Good evening, guys.
[02:10.82]How the hell are you?
[02:20.62]Wait, what?
[02:21.16]Right off the bat, Abarichi with three months.
[02:22.94]What's up, dude?
[02:25.65]How are you?
[02:26.15]Thanks for resubbing, man.
[02:28.21]Or... woman.
[02:33.15]Okay, I'm just gonna do a new game.
[02:34.39]It's gonna be loud, I'm sorry.
[02:43.16]I've never played this before.
[02:50.52]God bless.
[02:52.76]See, Hypo, we were talking about this.
[02:55.73]We were talking about this a while ago.
[02:58.99]We were.
[02:59.31]I'm saying it's Scorcher.
[03:00.17]Thanks for three months, man.
[03:00.93]This is the last game I expected ESU playing tonight.
[03:14.18]I can give you a Shaw's discount.
[03:20.97]Welcome back, Megacarp.
[03:22.13]God, this is so loud.
[03:23.81]I'm so sorry.
[03:25.70]Alright, you get the idea.
[03:28.64]Vegas is on fire and we have to save it.
[03:31.46]I have no idea.
[03:31.94]That was just too loud.
[03:32.79]I'm not going to make you guys suffer.
[03:34.47]I know this is too low.
[03:37.09]Here, why don't you just relax?
[03:54.97]Skip.
[03:58.41]Enter your character's name.
[03:59.39]Alright, this is important.
[04:03.83]Uh... You have to watch the intro.
[04:08.00]You don't have to watch the intro.
[04:10.80]I missed the plot.
[04:11.56]I know the plot.
[04:13.80]Somebody did something bad.
[04:15.80]The world ended.
[04:17.20]And it's in Fallout now.
[04:22.11]Uh... Gotta get a good name here.
[04:27.94]How about... How about Randy?
[04:33.40]No, that's not good.
[04:38.02]Trey... Jack... G-G-G-Granny?
[04:42.23]Barney?
[04:42.81]Juice Bakes!
[04:53.43]Welcome.
[04:53.83]Thank you.
[04:54.15]Oh, my God.
[04:54.71]Another one.
[05:03.49]And I was looking at.
[05:05.55]Hold on.
[05:07.07]Hold on.
[05:07.97]Hold on.
[05:08.23]I missed it.
[05:08.65]I missed it.
[05:09.29]I saw it for a second.
[05:11.11]Tyler Lethem.
[05:12.50]Tyler Lethem and.
[05:13.52]And I want to make sure I get your name right.
[05:16.84]I want to make sure I remember you all.
[05:20.27]Thank you guys, both of you, for the back-to-back jacks.
[05:26.07]Much appreciated.
[05:29.12]Continue.
[05:29.64]Okay.
[05:30.26]Jim Varney.
[05:32.40]I think our name has to be Jim Varney.
[05:33.86]What do you guys think?
[05:39.43]Does anybody know in this stream who Jim Varney is?
[05:45.13]He's a classic.
[05:47.99]Jim Varn.
[05:48.93]Is it Jim?
[05:49.43]It's Jim Varney, right?
[05:51.75]We're just going to go with Varney.
[05:54.59]I have a ratty skull, little honey.
[06:00.07]I will kill you just for... Just for him!
[06:05.80]Whoa!
[06:06.34]See you, Saurus.
[06:07.20]Thank you for subbing.
[06:08.64]Welcome to Good Springs.
[06:10.06]This guy's talking so low.
[06:11.62]Paul Bearers are screaming over him.
[06:12.94]You're going to go rooting around there in your noggin to pull all the bits of lead out.
[06:17.69]That's a back-to-back-to-back Jax, by the way, guys.
[06:20.46]Just take this!
[06:32.84]My character already looks like a fucking dickhead.
[06:34.82]Alright, let's see.
[06:37.62]Let's take a look.
[06:43.92]Why do they all have turkey necks?
[06:53.99]Turn on subtitles?
[06:54.83]I will.
[06:55.77]I will.
[06:55.97]I'll turn them on.
[07:01.34]I'm going to sit here all day.
[07:04.56]This is the most important thing about a Fallout game.
[07:11.22]Forehead.
[07:11.66]It just looks like a pissed off game show host.
[07:23.74]All Fallout 3 engine characters kind of look the same, don't they?
[07:26.34]Oh, hold on.
[07:29.62]Okay, I like it.
[07:50.48]Hmm.
[07:51.78]That's alright right there.
[07:54.55]My arch-nemesis wide face.
[08:04.06]Looks like Lyndon Johnson.
[08:11.56]I am the raddest girl, little honey.
[08:15.31]I will kill you just for... Just for help!
[08:21.45]My favorite rat friend just subscribed.
[08:24.85]Really, one of the rats just subscribed.
[08:27.27]My favorite one, apparently.
[08:28.37]Thank you so much, dude.
[08:32.19]I should try to make him Jim Varney, shouldn't I?
[08:33.92]Wait, what?
[08:35.92]Tazor, what do you think?
[08:36.66]Seven months.
[08:37.58]Damn.
[08:39.68]The more that I stream and the more that I keep this going and see the people that sub for that long, I forget.
[08:46.70]That's like a long fucking time.
[08:50.02]Thank you.
[08:52.03]I'm going to have to go back and make Jim Varney, right?
[08:55.41]I can't.
[08:55.81]I have to.
[08:57.03]If I have a character named Varney, he's going to have to be Jim Varney.
[09:05.72]What does Jim Varney look like?
[09:07.18]I forget.
[09:08.34]He's got long hair.
[09:09.42]I gave him more of a turkey neck.
[09:18.27]That's what I want.
[09:26.31]No, he's got to have bad turkey neck.
[09:29.90]Whoa, what the hell?
[09:33.10]Why can't I see it?
[09:38.66]Cozy90, thank you so much for subscribing.
[09:40.56]Why didn't it not pop up?
[09:41.79]That was weird.
[09:44.21]Huh.
[09:46.45]But thank you, Cozy.
[09:47.51]Nonetheless, that was weird.
[09:48.43]Why did that one not pop up and the other ones did?
[09:52.15]Unless like Twitch alerts is screwed up or something.
[10:02.16]I like it.
[10:02.58]Kind of want to go back to the cheeks.
[10:09.24]Inky the... See, look at that!
[10:12.33]Inky the Blot just showed up for five months.
[10:18.27]Thank you so much.
[10:29.68]General apocalyptic cheeseburger.
[10:32.74]Just subscribe.
[10:34.72]Thank you.
[10:35.62]Welcome.
[10:40.72]This guy sucks.
[10:41.68]This is not even funny.
[10:42.70]This just sucks.
[10:44.80]He just looks like a rubber Halloween mask.
[10:48.42]That's it.
[10:49.67]Don't you want to like peel this off and see the guy that's underneath?
[10:52.27]Okay, I kind of like that.
[11:08.39]Yeah, it's going to have to be blast back.
[11:16.64]He's beautiful.
[11:17.24]How dare you?
[11:21.04]Alright.
[11:21.42]Let me go.
[11:22.68]I don't like it.
[11:25.67]Age.
[11:32.51]He looks older here than he does here, doesn't he?
[11:35.45]Maybe not.
[11:42.00]Okay.
[11:42.22]Well, that's a little better.
[11:43.06]I'll go with that one.
[11:47.06]Facial hair.
[11:50.34]Now he just looks like Dante from Clerks.
[11:56.36]That's Dante.
[11:57.54]That's who I made.
[12:17.19]I can't stop staring at his neck.
[12:19.45]He does have a really weird neck.
[12:24.32]Honest Abe.
[12:24.84]Yeah, that's on his chin alright.
[12:26.58]He just has this second skin.
[12:28.62]That's just skin.
[12:29.72]That's all it is.
[12:43.18]Okay, I kind of want this one because it just looks like it's glued on.
[12:52.67]Look at this angle.
[12:53.99]I'm like behind this guy at a grocery store right now.
[13:00.61]It's called backwater.
[13:02.19]Remember that one?
[13:09.97]It's really important that you get this kind of angle here.
[13:24.73]See, I care more about what he looks like from here than from the front.
[13:40.58]I don't know.
[13:40.90]He doesn't need facial hair.
[13:41.90]It's from Bob's Burgers.
[13:44.88]Yeah, he does look like a Bob's Burgers character.
[13:46.51]None of them have chins.
[13:50.73]What was it called again?
[13:52.55]Where is it?
[13:54.43]There.
[13:56.11]I don't even like that.
[13:56.89]Alright, we're going with this one.
[14:07.38]This one's my favorite from this angle.
[14:08.98]Okay, let's go.
[14:20.07]Done.
[14:21.07]Yes.
[14:22.79]Hold on.
[14:23.35]I need to make this louder.
[14:24.52]I need to turn on subtitles.
[14:34.88]Alright.
[14:35.16]Charisma plus 10?
[14:35.66]I have to make me.
[14:36.28]And Jim Varney.
[14:38.94]And Bob.
[14:39.20]What the fuck was that?
[14:40.10]What was that?
[14:49.18]Why did I just rip my face off and look at the ceiling?
[14:57.29]Okay, the mouse needs to be changed, that's for sure.
[15:01.67]I think this is 90 FOV.
[15:03.01]I had to go into the INI.
[15:04.32]I hope I got it right.
[15:07.72]Get that correct.
[15:12.03]That scared me Vladimir badman you just scared me.
[15:19.89]I'm trying to link to my controls Which nude mods am I running all of them?
[15:26.65]Alright guys, you know we have to do Where's charisma?
[15:35.70]Where is it?
[15:36.70]There it is.
[15:37.22]I have to make the character that I'm supposed to be.
[15:42.38]Ten charisma.
[15:45.16]And, like, three points in, like, luck.
[15:49.59]According to Star, this is my character sheet.
[15:57.21]So, hold on.
[15:57.83]What does the charisma even do?
[16:02.20]Movie star, Casanova.
[16:03.44]Oh, dude, I'm a Casanova.
[16:04.92]That's kind of cool.
[16:10.22]cult leader how many more points do I have seven points we might as well put them all in luck 10 luck 10 charisma zero intelligence what does luck do some folks claim not to believe in luck doesn't look crits yeah enemy mishaps all skills critical hits enemy mishaps what the hell does that mean
[16:41.44]I'm pretty dumb.
[16:43.16]You know, I'm pretty stupid.
[16:44.20]I'm really dumb.
[16:53.71]You'll need intelligence for the charisma to work.
[16:56.11]Okay, yeah.
[16:56.87]I'll be able to know it all then.
[17:05.38]Endurance, that's fine.
[17:06.62]Perception, Jesus.
[17:09.90]Hey, you know, I am pretty oblivious to everything.
[17:13.88]I'm not that weak.
[17:14.70]I'm not that... I'm pretty strong guy.
[17:16.90]Hold on.
[17:17.22]Let's take a point off of intelligence.
[17:25.91]I'm pretty... I'm agile.
[17:29.07]There's too many points in luck.
[17:30.35]There really are too many points in luck.
[17:38.26]We take a point off of luck.
[17:39.46]I'm not that lucky.
[17:42.92]Jesus, this is bad.
[17:44.00]This is real bad.
[17:47.38]Minus 11 intelligence.
[17:53.41]Yeah, I'm at least a doughy baby, right?
[17:56.61]No, I'm fucking barrel chested.
[17:58.57]Give me more points.
[18:01.13]Who cares about endurance?
[18:03.37]I have to get up to barrel chested.
[18:05.11]It's important.
[18:05.71]It's going to make me feel better.
[18:13.25]Let's take another point off intelligence.
[18:19.41]There we go.
[18:22.93]Just absolutely not taking it from charisma.
[18:24.45]No way will I take it from charisma.
[18:28.71]Absolutely not.
[18:32.81]Okay, I think that's good.
[18:35.18]Six strength, one perception, three endurance, ten charisma, six intelligence, five agility, nine luck.
[18:45.74]Are we ready?
[18:49.84]I don't know how detrimental this is to have one perception.
[18:52.30]It's probably awful.
[18:53.86]And it's probably the worst thing I could possibly do.
[18:58.00]But, you know.
[19:00.80]That's just the way it is.
[19:01.74]Good to see them bullets didn't affect your charm, nun.
[19:04.79]Hey, thanks.
[19:05.57]Well, we know your vitals are good.
[19:07.89]But that don't mean them bullets didn't leave you nuttered in a bighorn or droppin'.
[19:11.79]What the hell are you saying?
[19:12.43]You say you take a seat in my couch and we go through a couple of questions.
[19:16.58]You have to take a test?
[19:17.68]Oh, I forgot.
[19:18.20]This is a Fallout game.
[19:18.96]You have to take a test.
[19:24.34]Alright.
[19:26.15]I'm going to say a word.
[19:27.71]I want you to say the first thing that comes to mind.
[19:30.61]Okay.
[19:31.05]Dog.
[19:31.67]Dog.
[19:33.19]Cat.
[19:33.94]House.
[19:35.30]Burglarize.
[19:36.24]Night.
[19:37.12]Day.
[19:37.66]Dream.
[19:39.24]Bandit.
[19:40.34]Bandit.
[19:41.00]Stab.
[19:41.84]Light.
[19:42.36]Dark.
[19:44.01]Mother.
[19:44.37]Sun.
[19:45.81]Cookie jar.
[19:47.71]Okay, now I got a few statements.
[19:50.51]I want you to tell me how much they sound like something you'd say.
[19:53.77]Okay.
[19:54.83]First one.
[19:56.37]Conflict just ain't in my nature.
[20:05.28]Conflict is not I did I know I I don't know.
[20:11.22]I know.
[20:11.74]I disagree.
[20:15.36]I ain't given to relying on others for support.
[20:21.38]Sometimes you need some help.
[20:22.58]Sometimes you got to give a hand.
[20:24.16]Sometimes you got to get a hand.
[20:26.46]I'm going to have to... What was the question again?
[20:29.79]I forget.
[20:31.93]Disagree.
[20:33.31]I'm always fixing to be the center of attention.
[20:35.79]Oh, absolutely.
[20:37.61]I'm slow to embrace new ideas.
[20:41.65]I don't think so.
[20:44.30]I charge in to deal with my problems head on.
[20:46.79]I do.
[20:48.01]I do.
[20:48.31]I agree.
[20:49.77]Almost done here.
[20:51.63]What do you say you have a look at this?
[20:54.07]Tell me what you see.
[20:55.09]Alright.
[20:55.43]What is it?
[20:57.19]This right here?
[20:58.45]He's talking about this.
[21:01.11]That's a skull.
[21:05.97]Is there a skull?
[21:11.15]There's none of those things.
[21:16.87]I'm gonna have to go with an angry two headed ant.
[21:20.35]Okay.
[21:21.65]How about this was an x ray of somebody's chest?
[21:28.74]No, that's okay.
[21:29.68]That's not there.
[21:36.19]It's a priceless P work of art.
[21:38.43]Last one.
[21:39.25]It's also an x ray of somebody's chest.
[21:46.25]No, look, it's two people putting their hands together.
[21:50.09]See, this is like the profile.
[21:50.91]See, this is like they're pressing, they're playing patty cake.
[21:53.61]Here's this guy's head.
[21:54.39]Here's the other guy's head.
[21:55.79]Here's his back.
[21:56.47]There's his legs.
[21:57.85]They're playing patty cake.
[21:59.15]Why is that not an option?
[22:04.85]Fucking mushroom cloud.
[22:06.39]Well, that's all she wrote.
[22:09.09]I don't have nothing to compare it to, so maybe you'd better just have a look at the results.
[22:13.27]Alright, let's see what I got.
[22:14.07]See if it all seems right to you.
[22:18.96]Explosives, melee weapons, and speech.
[22:23.50]What?
[22:27.42]I'm going to have to have a melee weapon guy?
[22:29.24]I'm going to have barter.
[22:36.39]Barter and speech are pretty important considering that I have a million charisma.
[22:42.43]My best hat, two months.
[22:44.11]Thank you so much, man.
[22:45.07]Welcome back.
[22:47.48]Medicine, guns.
[22:53.10]Should I do melee weapons?
[22:54.36]I'm going to get my ass kicked.
[22:55.86]Aren't I?
[23:02.13]Speech, barter, and sneak.
[23:07.69]That was my best hat.
[23:09.25]Should I do sneak, speech, and survival?
[23:14.85]Why is that making me laugh?
[23:17.63]No, we're going to do... My perception is so bad.
[23:21.43]Why would I do sneak?
[23:22.23]I'm going to do melee.
[23:24.29]Am I that strong to do melee?
[23:31.44]I don't know.
[23:35.35]Alright, we're going to go with barter or speech.
[23:36.79]This is what we're going to do.
[23:37.63]It's a done deal.
[23:39.83]Before I turn you loose, I need one more thing from you.
[23:42.61]Another exam?
[23:43.47]I've got a form for you to fill out.
[23:44.83]Jesus Christ.
[23:47.52]Just a formality.
[23:49.38]Ain't like I expect to find you got a family history of getting shot in the head.
[23:53.52]Okay.
[23:55.72]Alright, two traits.
[23:58.06]Build to destroy.
[24:00.17]Flamer that burns twice as bright.
[24:01.99]All weapons have a plus 3% chance to critically hit, but equipment condition decays 15% faster.
[24:06.35]Um...
[24:10.68]I mean, I already have a bunch of luck.
[24:11.78]Am I going to really need that?
[24:15.72]Good-natured.
[24:16.36]You are good-natured at heart, more prone to solving problems with your mind than violence.
[24:21.57]Plus five to barter, medicine, repair, science, and speech.
[24:25.61]But minus five to energy, weapons, explosive, guns, melee weapons, and unarmed.
[24:28.91]I don't know if I like that.
[24:35.74]I have a bunch of luck.
[24:36.48]Don't I want crits?
[24:40.60]Loose Cannon I think no small frame I was gonna pick it just because I have like a small frame what wild wasteland unleashes the most bizarre and silly elements of post-apocalyptic America not for the faint of heart or the serious of temperament there's a silly mode
[25:13.35]Okay, why would I not pick silly mode?
[25:16.20]I'm going to go with good-natured.
[25:22.16]Good-natured.
[25:22.58]I want to be able to solve my issues without violence.
[25:30.84]Good-natured and silly.
[25:32.40]That's how I live my life, don't you know?
[25:35.77]Let's do it.
[25:39.47]Silly mode actor.
[25:42.47]Okay, let's go home.
[25:48.70]That guy is so awkward.
[25:49.72]Is this actually his first time?
[25:57.61]Yes, it is.
[26:01.28]Was all you had on you when you was brought in.
[26:03.26]Forced impact, 18 bottle caps.
[26:05.04]I gave the note a look.
[26:06.18]I thought it might help me find a next of kin.
[26:08.16]Pistol.
[26:09.06]But it was just something about a platinum chip.
[26:11.64]Okay.
[26:12.34]Well, if you're heading back out there, you ought to have this.
[26:16.24]They call it a Pip-Boy.
[26:17.58]Oh, Pip-Boy!
[26:18.28]Pog-Chip!
[26:19.10]Pog-Chip!
[26:20.12]Let me see those Pog-Champs, dude.
[26:22.62]Ain't much use to me now, but you might want such a thing after what you've been through.
[26:26.49]I know what it's like having something taken from you.
[26:31.51]And put this on too so the locals don't pick on you for lack and modesty.
[26:36.68]It wasn't much my style anyway.
[26:39.98]Thanks for patching me up, Doc.
[26:41.14]You shouldn't have gone through my stuff.
[26:42.58]What do I do now?
[26:44.56]You should talk to Sunny Smiles before you leave town.
[26:47.46]She can help you learn to fend for yourself in the desert.
[26:50.42]Okay.
[26:51.16]She'll likely be at the saloon.
[26:53.50]Sure.
[26:53.64]I reckon some of the other folks at the saloon might be able to help you out, too.
[26:57.88]And the metal fella, Victor, who pulled you out of your grave.
[27:01.69]Anyway, you ever get hurt out there, you come right back.
[27:04.29]I will.
[27:04.65]I'll fix you up.
[27:05.97]But try not to get killed anymore.
[27:09.38]Hardcore mode.
[27:11.10]Fallout New Vegas allows you to play in a new hardcore mode that greatly increases the challenge of the game.
[27:15.64]I don't even need to read anymore.
[27:19.43]No.
[27:19.61]This is the first time I'm ever playing this game.
[27:23.62]I'm not going to do the hardcore Diablo mode.
[27:40.60]No, shit.
[27:41.22]No, no, I don't want to put that away.
[27:42.76]Get that back.
[27:50.39]The fuck else do you got?
[28:05.10]I'm taking pencils.
[28:08.70]Why am I taking pencils?
[28:10.04]I can't... I do this every time I play one of these games.
[28:12.38]I can't stop.
[28:13.02]I'm gonna need those books for later.
[28:21.16]Wait, hold on.
[28:21.58]I gotta make sure there's nothing else important I can take from this guy's house.
[28:30.79]What was the red?
[28:31.35]Oh, I can sleep in his bed.
[28:36.26]I thought you were good-natured so much for- You can be good-natured and still take things from people that don't belong to you.
[28:47.11]Man, I'm gonna sleeve his bed too.
[28:53.54]Yeah, we're gonna run his sink.
[28:59.06]What am I doing?
[28:59.60]I'm drinking.
[29:02.16]Can I drink from the toilet?
[29:04.37]Oh, fuck, you can!
[29:10.28]I should not be doing this.
[29:15.22]Can I drink from the dirty bathtub?
[29:22.75]You monster.
[29:23.65]Alright, let's go.
[29:31.22]You want me to leave a double decker?
[29:32.72]You want me to put shit in his can?
[29:34.56]Okay, let's look at this for a second.
[29:41.45]Status, special skills.
[29:43.72]Where's my other items?
[29:46.22]All weapons fall under a weapon skill category.
[29:48.22]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29:51.22]Damn, DPS.
[29:52.26]Yeah, it's just many weapons have a strength or skill.
[29:55.68]Condition.
[29:56.28]Repair.
[30:00.81]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[30:01.83]Straight razor.
[30:03.19]Or knife.
[30:03.53]I don't want the knife.
[30:07.19]Peril.
[30:07.67]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[30:09.29]I've played Fallout once in my life before.
[30:23.14]The Cullen Crusader.
[30:26.73]Cullen Crusader, thank you for subscribing.
[30:28.55]Welcome.
[30:31.45]Ammunition, yeah.
[30:33.55]Okay.
[30:34.87]Do I have my knife?
[30:36.93]How do I take the weapon out?
[30:43.14]How do I take it out?
[30:44.66]Wait, what?
[30:46.44]Militant Seagull, two months.
[30:47.80]Thank you so much.
[30:49.64]Welcome back.
[30:50.24]Welcome to both of you back.
[30:55.16]Seriously, how do I take the fucking knife out?
[31:00.45]I need to look at the controls because I need to change these two.
[31:04.73]Action mapping.
[31:05.59]Forward, yeah, yeah.
[31:06.49]Attack.
[31:07.93]What?
[31:10.95]Why is attack unbound?
[31:11.77]Unbound.
[31:14.36]Are you serious?
[31:21.19]Quick save is F9.
[31:21.97]Alright, whatever.
[31:32.05]Why do I feel like I'm running at times two speed right now?
[31:34.47]I have to leave the doctor's house first?
[31:42.94]Oh, bright.
[31:59.21]You thought I was good-natured.
[32:01.27]I just did that to make Twitch chat think I was good.
[32:04.87]But in reality, I'm the worst of the fucking worst.
[32:11.39]Can I have a piece of that bread?
[32:15.94]Give me that fucking bread!
[32:17.12]What do you got?
[32:24.24]Give me it all.
[32:24.78]All of it.
[32:26.20]I gotta hide the body.
[32:31.38]Good-natured murderer.
[32:34.56]Okay, calm down.
[32:35.18]No, I don't want to wait.
[32:41.14]Where am I going?
[32:41.70]That guy looks like a fucking idiot.
[32:50.39]Why am I wearing like a WWF belt?
[32:57.01]It's going to first person for a little bit.
[32:59.33]I gotta go this way, right?
[33:00.31]Sally Fields or something?
[33:06.39]I have a ratty skull, little honey.
[33:09.42]I will kill you just for... Just for help!
[33:15.66]Alty... Altytanized.
[33:17.62]I'm sorry.
[33:18.48]I don't have my glasses on.
[33:20.35]Altytanized.
[33:21.11]Altytanized.
[33:22.71]Welcome.
[33:22.95]Thank you for subscribing.
[33:23.77]I just butchered this shit out of your name.
[33:25.47]Easy peasy.
[33:26.59]Howdy.
[33:27.61]What can Easy Pete do for you?
[33:30.99]Do you know anything about the people who are... Why are you called Easy Pete?
[33:34.15]Do you know anything about Victor?
[33:37.15]Why do they call you Easy Pete?
[33:38.17]I was a prospector until I decided to settle here to get away from the NCR.
[33:44.29]Now, I'll just take it easy and help out with the Brahmin and Bighorners.
[33:49.31]Mm-hmm.
[33:52.23]Hey, you dig for gold and stuff.
[33:53.51]See, I'm a talker.
[33:54.11]I'm talking to this guy.
[33:55.74]It means I poke through old buildings looking for working tech and such.
[34:00.49]Some folks just call it salvaging, but never like the term.
[34:04.57]Okay.
[34:04.85]The way I see it, salvage means it's broken near worth.
[34:08.75]Flying Shy Guy with the subscription, the new subscription.
[34:14.56]Thank you very much.
[34:25.17]Should I destroy him?
[34:26.05]No, I can't kill everybody, guys.
[34:28.99]That wouldn't be... Etalyx.
[34:31.15]Etalyx coming in with the host.
[34:33.97]Holy shit.
[34:34.90]Raise your Etalyx pog.
[34:36.46]Raise your Etalyx, guys.
[34:40.10]Hi, Etalyx.
[34:40.90]If you don't know who Etalyx is, he just got done streaming, probably.
[34:45.58]Stellaris.
[34:46.94]He's a good dude.
[34:47.56]I recommend you go follow him.
[34:49.13]He'll watch his streams.
[34:55.07]I'll just keep him talking who cares Kind of just don't care anymore.
[34:59.59]Why did I pick the speech?
[35:01.43]Why did I do this?
[35:02.69]I picked speech and Charisma I fucking hate I hate talking in these games.
[35:07.07]I don't want to talk to people I
[35:22.55]I don't want to do that.
[35:23.59]I want to just play.
[35:24.79]But now I've made myself have to do this.
[35:27.59]Okay, bye.
[35:28.02]That is so menacing.
[35:29.68]You know, it was real nice talking to you, Easy Pete.
[35:58.88]Okay.
[35:59.08]Okay, sure.
[36:01.37]Doc Mitchell said you could teach me how to survive in the desert.
[36:07.77]Yeah.
[36:08.27]Yeah.
[36:12.08]Okay.
[36:39.86]What?
[36:40.96]Where did she go?
[36:47.68]She just disappeared.
[36:51.95]He doesn't care?
[36:55.03]What the fuck just happened?
[37:01.13]Okay.
[37:05.58]I guess we're okay.
[37:06.58]Alright.
[37:10.87]Just wanted to blindly throw my knife around.
[37:12.87]We'll go behind the saloon.
[37:16.04]Let's check the saloon.
[37:20.32]There she is.
[37:20.68]Alright.
[37:20.94]Hey.
[37:22.70]Teach me the ways of the Vermont rifle.
[37:37.36]Jarek Bodzioich.
[37:38.87]Bodzioich, thank you for subscribing.
[37:40.49]And, oh my god.
[37:42.41]Oh, I must have shot her.
[37:50.75]And Bob the Pineapple with the back-to-back subs.
[37:55.20]Holy shit.
[37:58.46]I can't play these games, guys.
[38:00.62]Do you understand?
[38:01.24]I can't do this.
[38:04.79]What does she want me to do?
[38:06.49]Shoot the barrels?
[38:08.15]Got it.
[38:08.43]I got one.
[38:11.94]How close can I get?
[38:23.66]You know, you might want to get out of the way.
[38:25.78]It probably would be a good idea if you were to get out of the way.
[38:29.44]A guy with a gun is trying to shoot on the range.
[38:32.49]And you're just looking cool.
[38:33.77]What are you doing?
[38:34.19]Wait, what?
[38:36.83]Hello, I'm Spider-Man for two months.
[38:38.57]Welcome, man.
[38:39.07]Thanks.
[38:42.91]Seriously.
[38:43.55]I... I can't shoot this?
[38:50.58]I can't fucking shoot these?
[38:51.98]Nice shot.
[38:52.38]I just cheated.
[39:14.22]Fuck off.
[39:14.44]Yeah.
[39:14.54]Uh huh.
[39:14.74]Uh huh.
[39:14.90]Uh huh.
[39:15.08]Do what?
[39:15.78]Somewhere else?
[39:16.24]So what?
[39:17.20]I have to meet somebody?
[39:17.98]I have to meet her friend?
[39:59.46]What is that?
[39:59.88]Wow.
[40:02.82]Cool.
[40:03.26]I don't care.
[40:05.12]I don't want to listen to you.
[40:07.34]What did I need to do?
[40:20.08]I needed to go somewhere, right?
[40:21.36]I need to talk to somebody at the bar.
[40:25.92]Let me use the sewing machine and make some clothes.
[40:28.21]I can't use it.
[40:32.33]What about the smoothie maker?
[40:33.95]Can I make a fucking smoothie?
[40:35.79]Nah, I don't have enough fucking blueberries.
[40:41.81]What am I doing?
[40:44.05]Is this not the bar?
[40:47.55]Why am I breaking into the side door of the bar?
[40:53.22]I don't think I should be doing this.
[41:02.36]Um... Okay.
[41:09.08]Turn on the radio.
[41:14.56]Why was this door... This doesn't make any sense.
[41:17.30]Shunned?
[41:17.80]What did I just do?
[41:19.72]A reputation with a group of people in the wasteland.
[41:21.32]Whether that reputation is good or bad, you finally... And people associated with that group will start to react to what you've done.
[41:26.92]There are many different factions in the wasteland.
[41:28.56]You can develop a distinct reputation with each one.
[41:30.64]Uh-oh.
[41:37.30]Uh-oh.
[41:39.82]That doesn't sound good.
[41:43.90]You've left a poor impression on the community and maybe shunned as a result.
[41:47.57]I don't care.
[41:50.25]I'm serious?
[41:53.71]Oh no, they're gonna shun me.
[41:56.11]Where's he going?
[41:56.75]Where you going?
[41:57.09]Where the fuck are you going?
[41:59.77]You ran out of here.
[42:00.41]I was chasing you.
[42:00.97]I don't know what... Don't you run away from me.
[42:07.29]No soup for you three months.
[42:08.67]Thank you.
[42:09.51]I'm following this guy.
[42:11.53]He just took the whiskey that I just stole.
[42:13.35]He's taking it somewhere.
[42:14.01]Where are you taking it to?
[42:34.15]Go ahead.
[42:34.55]Come on.
[42:39.01]Now, I kinda don't want to do it.
[42:41.97]He's really confident.
[42:45.15]Okay, yeah, I'm not gonna... Yeah, he's scary.
[42:47.74]I don't like him.
[42:57.52]Warning shot.
[43:03.53]God, this chat has bloodlust.
[43:04.93]Yeah, they do.
[43:08.96]Well, for 24 hours.
[43:10.74]Prospector Saloon.
[43:12.08]Come on in.
[43:14.86]Can I kick their bikes over and get Pee Wee Herman?
[43:23.13]Put it away.
[43:25.03]That's easy.
[43:25.47]Pete, where's the lady?
[43:26.61]There she is.
[43:27.55]Trudy, right?
[43:28.07]Alright.
[43:36.50]I'm trying to track down the people who attacked me.
[43:38.16]Do you know anything about it?
[43:38.88]Not much, other than there were a bunch of freeloaders who expected a few rounds on the house.
[43:42.82]I was able to get them to pay up, though.
[43:45.08]Of course, one of the great cons did knock my radio to the floor by accident.
[43:48.94]Oh, what a dick.
[43:49.63]It hasn't been working since.
[43:52.45]Where are they going?
[43:52.93]Mm-hmm.
[43:53.11]Mm-hmm.
[43:53.29]Yep.
[43:53.43]Okay.
[43:53.53]And rise dot.
[44:07.17]That whole area is overrun with the kind of critters that just get mad if you shoot them.
[44:11.29]Merchants avoid that whole stretch of I-15 like it's radioactive, which it could be for all I know.
[44:17.95]I didn't hear exactly, but the leader was talking about the strip.
[44:21.05]The fellow wants to get there and avoid the 15.
[44:23.45]He'd have to go east.
[44:24.99]Can I just sell her back all the dumb shit I've stolen?
[44:32.30]Give her this ashtray.
[44:37.62]Some cigarettes.
[44:43.72]Fucking mosquito pod.
[44:44.70]I don't want to give her a mosquito.
[44:50.22]So many of these dumb books.
[44:52.42]They're worth nothing.
[45:00.94]Jesus.
[45:03.62]Get that out of here.
[45:06.10]Scalpel.
[45:06.92]I don't want it.
[45:10.36]Dude, remind me don't ever pick up books again because there's no reason to ever do that.
[45:14.43]I get like two caps for 30 books.
[45:18.23]Wait, what?
[45:20.73]Dr. Strum Puppet.
[45:22.69]Two months.
[45:23.35]Welcome back, dude.
[45:25.83]I hope you're having a great day.
[45:30.40]Empty syringes.
[45:31.12]Yeah, take these.
[45:34.26]Okay.
[45:35.06]Now, do you have a melee weapon?
[45:37.60]I want a melee weapon.
[45:41.51]meeting people care.
[45:43.30]Alright, exit.
[45:49.80]Another satisfied customer.
[45:52.16]Oh, let me take a look at your broken radio.
[45:54.66]The outside looks okay.
[45:55.88]But there'd be caps in it for you.
[45:58.42]I do like to hear what's going on in the world.
[46:00.92]That Mr. New Vegas seems like such a gentleman.
[46:03.60]Again, I'll fix her.
[46:07.56]Yeah, alright.
[46:08.20]So I'm gonna fix your radio.
[46:09.62]Where's the radio?
[46:13.22]This is the radio, right?
[46:13.98]Alright, I'll fix it for you.
[46:22.21]It didn't work.
[46:24.25]Something's wrong with the inside of it.
[46:25.75]I can't fix it.
[46:26.41]There's a gun in there.
[46:27.29]There's a gun in here.
[46:28.81]Look at that.
[46:29.21]Oh, that's a nice gun.
[46:30.13]I'm gonna take it.
[46:32.36]How do I do the karate chop to her neck?
[46:34.94]And then kill that guy.
[46:35.70]Should I just take this and run?
[46:39.12]Dude, look at all this.
[46:40.28]Are you serious?
[46:42.51]You can't be serious.
[46:43.59]I want every single thing on this counter.
[46:57.98]Got it.
[47:05.00]Detected.
[47:05.82]Hidden.
[47:10.80]How would you not see me?
[47:11.88]I'm taking the cup too.
[47:16.94]Oh!
[47:23.89]Get out of the way!
[47:27.53]Come on, I want the rest of it.
[47:28.79]Give me the register too.
[47:29.72]Can I take the whole register?
[47:33.84]It's a shooter with her own gun.
[47:38.04]Wait, what?! !
[47:40.02]True blue, three months.
[47:43.84]What are you looking at, you bastard?
[47:49.87]How much does he... Will she buy this?
[47:51.11]Hey.
[47:54.34]Get me away from the counter.
[47:55.44]Alright, I have some things to sell you.
[48:01.27]Uh, yeah, Steve, what do you got for sale?
[48:03.31]I have quite a few things for sale, actually.
[48:04.97]Uh, just got a big, big, uh... Where is it?
[48:16.48]Where's all the stuff I took?
[48:21.57]I can't sell it back to her?
[48:35.86]Fresh till death.
[48:38.73]Fresh till death.
[48:39.45]Thank you for subbing.
[48:41.51]Welcome back.
[48:44.91]No, welcome back.
[48:45.49]Welcome for the first time.
[48:46.27]I don't know why I said welcome back.
[48:48.09]Alright, goodbye.
[48:48.81]I'm just gonna... What's the next thing I have to do?
[48:54.32]Can't sell stolen items?
[48:55.50]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[48:57.98]There you go.
[48:58.32]Let's go.
[48:58.70]Let's do our first quest.
[49:02.56]Alright.
[49:04.04]See you later.
[49:04.48]Don't let me ever catch you around.
[49:05.39]My town.
[49:28.05]Are you like a Stark or something?
[49:29.25]I don't understand this.
[49:29.87]What's with the big dire wolf?
[49:33.55]Fuck you.
[49:36.47]I was gonna do it.
[49:37.03]I was just gonna do it.
[49:37.77]Alright.
[49:41.11]Everything I've learned from GTA is shoot the gas tank.
[49:48.23]No.
[49:50.23]I already bolted.
[49:51.11]Okay.
[49:57.80]Oh, let's open up the map.
[50:00.32]Where's the map?
[50:02.88]Do I even have a map?
[50:09.54]Where's my map?
[50:10.54]She said southeast, right?
[50:13.92]Where's my fucking map?
[50:17.95]Okay, look at that.
[50:18.65]World map.
[50:19.83]So I need to go down here, right?
[50:23.09]Yep.
[50:25.77]So that way?
[50:28.02]It begins.
[50:28.54]Let's do the journey begins.
[50:29.65]There's too many things to do.
[50:37.45]I always just get lost in these games because I can't play them.
[50:42.17]It's taking me like 40 minutes to walk down the first road.
[50:58.75]Everyone's telling me to go north?
[51:00.33]Why?
[51:00.57]There's nothing up there.
[51:03.89]I have something to do down here.
[51:04.93]I have to go to prim.
[51:06.53]Let's turn it up a little bit more.
[51:17.32]It's still a little low.
[51:23.43]That's a little better.
[51:28.43]Turn on the radio?
[51:29.39]No, I don't like music in my video.
[51:32.90]Before you venture deeper into the wasteland, you may revise your character.
[51:35.62]No, let's go.
[51:37.86]Okay, so this is Prim.
[51:47.20]It's that way.
[51:48.24]Las Vegas is that way.
[51:49.56]Okay, we're gonna go to Prim.
[51:56.09]Good old Prim.
[51:59.91]Tell me there was going to be hostiles out here.
[52:01.61]I better be careful.
[52:03.03]I don't want to die.
[52:03.65]I see a guy over there.
[52:08.24]That might be a hostile.
[52:11.24]Yeah.
[52:13.14]I was told to be aware.
[52:16.26]Looks like we got two hostiles.
[52:19.56]At the abandoned truck facility.
[52:25.11]What the fuck was that?
[52:29.04]What?
[52:29.56]Who threw a grenade?
[52:31.74]None of these guys even moved.
[52:34.36]Nobody did anything.
[52:38.30]Seriously, nobody did anything.
[52:40.11]And now this guy's just standing on top of it like tap dancing on his friend.
[52:49.75]What on Earth is going on right now?
[52:53.85]This guy's using your friend as a Stairmaster.
[52:59.97]Are they both the same person?
[53:00.99]Okay, I gotta get my stim pack.
[53:12.16]Gotta get my stim.
[53:16.98]Uh, status.
[53:21.60]That's bullshit.
[53:35.24]What the fuck is going on?
[53:37.26]Oh, you want to throw invisible dynamite at me, don't you?
[53:39.68]That's what you want to do?
[53:40.38]I swear to God, I'll light this.
[53:47.42]I swear to God, eventually I will light this.
[53:49.24]I swear.
[54:06.10]God, that was terrible.
[54:08.88]That was fucking awful.
[54:10.24]Oh my god.
[54:18.79]Wow, that was horrible.
[54:28.43]I gained karma from that.
[54:32.61]How did I gain karma?
[54:36.71]Alright, no more fucking around.
[54:37.71]Let's just go.
[54:40.81]Apparently those are bad guys.
[54:43.09]Death count one.
[54:44.31]Death count.
[54:49.31]Dude, that guy blew my leg.
[54:50.49]I didn't know this game was that gory.
[54:52.05]Didn't know it was that terrible of a game.
[54:56.91]Was Fallout 3 like that?
[54:58.45]I don't remember Fallout 3 limbs coming off.
[55:00.78]Melons are good.
[55:01.58]Two months.
[55:03.28]Thanks.
[55:05.01]You are lovely.
[55:10.47]I do want to go kill... I got karma back from killing those guys.
[55:13.23]Those apparently are bad guys.
[55:19.15]Maybe I'll just walk by them.
[55:20.90]I've got quicksave, right?
[55:22.42]What?
[55:22.88]F9?
[55:23.02]I'm going to have to... I think F9 might end the stream.
[55:29.76]So I don't think I want to do that.
[55:35.27]Quicksave F5.
[55:36.47]I'm gonna make it... What the hell am I gonna make this?
[55:46.22]Like this button.
[55:47.10]The plus.
[55:48.34]The equals, whatever.
[55:49.06]Okay, that works.
[55:59.34]Wait, what?
[55:59.87]What?
[56:05.59]How do I feel about backseating right now?
[56:06.97]Because this is blind.
[56:08.17]I don't know anything.
[56:08.79]I don't really care.
[56:11.17]I'd like to just do whatever the hell I'm going to do.
[56:16.03]This is not like Dark Souls 3, though.
[56:17.88]I didn't want to know anything about it.
[56:18.88]This game's been out for like fucking 60 years, so I don't really care.
[56:21.96]Although, don't fucking backseat me, bro.
[56:30.57]Am I going the right way?
[56:31.63]I have to go towards that rollercoaster, right?
[56:37.54]So are these guys actually hostile?
[56:39.88]Aren't these guys going to step on their own minds?
[56:50.05]Laughs with knives.
[56:51.75]Hey, what a coincidence.
[56:53.93]I do that too.
[56:56.05]Thanks for the resub, man.
[57:01.67]Powder Ganger Camp West.
[57:12.60]I'm gonna talk to these guys.
[57:15.80]Any lawman that comes after me won't have it easy.
[57:18.48]Yeah, we weren't a badass.
[57:19.64]Okay, what about you?
[57:21.10]God damn it.
[57:21.76]I didn't even step on it.
[57:22.66]I wasn't even close.
[57:23.75]And why did he not get hurt?
[57:27.55]Never gets old when something blows up.
[57:29.61]I wasn't even close.
[57:31.51]I was standing in the spot that he was standing in.
[57:33.55]We were standing in the same spot.
[57:35.35]Why did I trigger it and he didn't?
[57:38.13]Game sucks.
[57:42.39]Alright, both of you just shut up.
[57:44.63]I'm gone.
[57:45.03]I'm just gonna be Mr. Limpy from now on.
[57:47.27]Rewind the tape.
[57:49.44]No, this is fine.
[57:50.42]I'll be alright.
[57:52.46]This is really silent.
[58:14.32]What is that?
[58:15.60]What is that thing running around?
[58:16.72]It's like a little meerkat.
[58:17.90]Uh-oh.
[58:21.30]Uh-oh.
[58:24.04]Uh-oh.
[58:26.04]Hold on.
[58:29.08]I hear music.
[58:37.57]There it is.
[58:38.07]Here it comes.
[58:40.13]It's time to... What is that?
[58:43.17]He's stuck in the ground.
[58:46.05]You just made this so easy for me.
[58:54.82]He's still alive.
[58:55.56]Okay, accept.
[59:08.89]Where am- where is he?
[59:10.03]What the f- I can't fucking move!
[59:18.40]Seriously, what on... Who just screamed?
[59:23.74]Who's screaming?
[59:30.71]I think that's me screaming.
[59:40.04]Alright, let's end this shit.
[59:46.42]Yeah, fuck you.
[59:47.68]I got you.
[59:50.82]Give me your regs.
[59:57.42]Let's keep going.
[60:03.48]Good shooting.
[60:08.47]It's gonna be dark and then the creepers and the zombies are gonna come after me.
[60:11.07]I have to build a hut.
[60:15.60]Oh shit, look out.
[60:16.28]A couple of bugs.
[60:22.80]These are all so terrible.
[60:24.72]These percentages are so bad.
[60:25.86]No, give me my knife.
[60:28.46]Supposed to be melee guy, right?
[60:29.64]Alright, that's got you.
[60:46.12]That was so lame.
[60:46.92]This is my first time playing this game.
[60:49.38]Yes.
[60:53.22]This is just on normal difficulty.
[60:54.48]Now we're gonna go to Buffalo Bill's Bison Park.
[61:07.02]I am the raddest girl, little honey.
[61:09.94]I will kill you just for... Just for him!
[61:15.92]Tanager4392.
[61:17.88]Thank you for subscribing so much, dude.
[61:21.62]You are the best.
[61:23.34]You've joined the group of proverbial, of biblical proportions.
[61:31.89]Where the fuck am I going?
[61:38.21]There's probably a front door.
[61:39.71]Go the other way, dummy.
[61:42.23]Press the tilde key and type TGM.
[61:44.57]What the hell does that do?
[61:51.52]TGM.
[61:57.47]What the hell does that stand for?
[62:02.25]Press Q to high noon.
[62:03.29]Hey, where the hell do you think you're going?
[62:08.67]Prim is off limits.
[62:10.82]How do I tell this really shitty bootleg Robin to fuck off?
[62:18.00]It's your ass.
[62:18.84]Don't say you weren't warned.
[62:20.96]I'm fine.
[62:26.26]What do you got over here?
[62:35.61]Supplies?
[62:36.09]Ooh, fresh water.
[62:37.71]Fresh Poland Springs, huh?
[62:39.23]I'll take some of that for sure.
[62:40.62]Oh, never mind.
[62:42.50]It's all empty.
[62:53.57]Let me make sure I'm in the right spot here.
[62:59.39]That was easy.
[62:59.86]I can just click a button and get there for free.
[63:08.26]TGM is god mode?
[63:09.50]I don't want to do that.
[63:10.20]Is that guy dead?
[63:20.94]Is he dead?
[63:22.56]What the fuck?
[63:26.48]Hold on a second.
[63:30.38]That guy just exploded.
[63:34.50]Alright, it's time.
[63:35.28]It's time for you to get fucking destroyed, buddy.
[63:39.69]Ooh, what's this?
[63:41.45]What, is this the guy?
[63:42.59]The Batman guy?
[63:47.71]Stabbed.
[63:50.73]Yeah.
[63:51.05]Alright, back it up, back it up.
[63:58.74]Hold on, I gotta heal.
[64:02.64]How do I- I can put these, like, on the, uh, like, bar, can't I?
[64:06.02]Oh my god, I can't even heal anymore.
[64:07.02]I'm gonna drink some fucking booze.
[64:12.12]Are you seriously running right now?
[64:16.00]Get the fuck over here.
[64:17.05]Why?
[64:36.30]100 bucks, alright.
[64:37.32]Look at all this stuff.
[64:42.66]Alright, what is that weapon?
[64:45.80]Tire iron?
[64:47.32]Four, six, or nine, ooh.
[64:51.40]I'm gonna have to put on the tire iron.
[64:55.32]The weapon is in port.
[64:56.96]That didn't hit anything.
[64:58.99]I'm hitting him, okay.
[65:02.39]No, you chose the silly mode.
[65:03.75]Oh yeah, I forgot, I did choose silly mode.
[65:06.60]Is that why this dumb shit is happening?
[65:08.01]Because I picked silly mode.
[65:09.01]Is that what's going on?
[65:12.93]What exactly am I supposed to be doing here, by the way?
[65:17.23]Inquire about your delivery assignment.
[65:19.31]Inquire about your delivery assignment with the administrator of the Mojave Express in Prim.
[65:28.94]I'm going to assume it's that.
[65:30.56]It's this.
[65:30.88]There's a casino right here.
[65:34.04]Can I do some gambling?
[65:41.30]Nope.
[65:41.66]Nope.
[65:41.86]Nope.
[65:42.02]Nope.
[65:42.20]Nope.
[65:42.34]Nope.
[65:42.50]Nope.
[65:43.18]Nope.
[65:46.74]I think I know what I gotta do.
[65:49.60]I'm pretty sure I gotta go on the train tracks.
[65:51.42]I gotta go up the mountain.
[65:56.33]There we go.
[65:57.05]Okay.
[66:01.23]I gotta find... I gotta find the cart.
[66:13.50]So where is it?
[66:13.94]Down there?
[66:19.26]What the fuck?
[66:21.11]Where did you... Where did you come from?
[66:25.63]That's unbelievable.
[66:26.61]That scared the shit out of me.
[66:27.97]Is my shit broken?
[66:43.96]There was no reason for that guy to be there.
[66:47.60]God.
[66:52.94]Come on.
[66:55.44]Come on.
[67:05.75]Silly mode.
[67:06.67]Seriously, this is just silly mode.
[67:09.75]I'm out of... I need to heal.
[67:11.01]Do I need rat meat?
[67:14.72]I have some scotch squirrel stew.
[67:19.16]I got some white horseradish.
[67:22.18]Some wine.
[67:22.76]Coca-Cola.
[67:25.82]No.
[67:33.38]Just give me some of this mesquite pod.
[67:35.42]I'll be alright.
[67:40.04]Already.
[67:40.40]I ate it one second ago.
[67:42.18]It already wore off.
[67:48.99]I can't, I don't think I can make that jump.
[67:53.08]This is just such a silly mode, huh?
[67:58.78]Hold on, hold on, really important.
[68:04.87]I'm okay.
[68:14.93]This person apparently is like right over here somewhere.
[68:22.96]in there?
[68:23.42]I guess I... But these people were trying to kill me.
[68:32.10]All the people in this room were shooting at me.
[68:35.52]I must have done something wrong.
[68:41.43]It wants me to go over here, I guess?
[68:45.91]There it is.
[68:47.65]Alright.
[68:50.59]I will take a quest.
[68:55.25]What is this fucking raisin?
[68:56.25]This guy has so many wrinkles on his face, he seriously just looks like a raisin.
[68:59.02]You must have at least 30 cards to play Caravan.
[69:01.44]Why does the game Caravan require a gun?
[69:26.03]I asked this guy to play a card game and he's going to kill me?
[69:28.59]Let's play it.
[69:36.19]What is this?
[69:44.26]I don't get it.
[69:45.76]Why did you need to do that?
[69:51.11]Johnson Nash is my name.
[69:53.51]Husband of Ruben.
[69:54.25]His voice just changed.
[69:55.37]Lived in prim going on eight years now.
[69:57.73]Thick and thin.
[69:59.01]I'm a trader primarily.
[70:00.23]For what it's worth with things like they are.
[70:03.77]I also run the local Mojave Express outpost.
[70:06.79]Okay now he's Bill Clinton.
[70:09.90]He went from like old guy to Bill Clinton.
[70:12.96]Well I don't got any work right now sorry to say.
[70:15.50]Different voice again.
[70:17.04]That was another voice.
[70:19.49]I'll tell you whatever I can.
[70:21.07]You have a delivery order you can show me.
[70:22.73]Yeah.
[70:27.06]Oh, you're talking about one of them packages.
[70:31.20]That job had strange written all over it, but we couldn't turn down the caps.
[70:35.54]Wait, what?
[70:37.42]Carlos the Clam, two months.
[70:39.04]Thank you so much.
[70:40.48]That is two months in a row of subscription mode.
[70:45.91]You are unbelievable.
[70:47.71]We all love you.
[70:52.52]Well, now that you mention it, a few nights back, one of the townies was out scavenging for supplies.
[70:58.25]Look at those fucking cyborg eyes.
[70:59.23]He said he saw a fellow in a daisy suit come through with some of them great con misfits.
[71:05.35]This dude just sounds like he's drunk in the recording studio.
[71:10.47]Well, for that, your best bet is going to be talking to Deputy Beagle.
[71:14.44]Since they came to town, he was keeping a good bit of notes on them.
[71:17.98]And he was slinking around Bison Steve when your pretty boy friend came through.
[71:22.78]That's a lot of quests you just gave me.
[71:23.70]Okay, bye.
[71:39.84]Combat knife.
[71:40.68]Combat knife.
[71:48.19]I forgot I have to get up and I have to point my gun to walk.
[71:54.66]I thought they were going to shoot each other.
[71:57.40]Okay.
[72:00.76]Hey there.
[72:01.36]Howdy.
[72:04.90]Howdy.
[72:05.71]You're freaking me out.

[72:26.55]I'll try it.
[72:32.92]Female Jesus.
[72:36.00]Not to be mistaken with the male Jesus.
[72:39.30]Two months in a row.
[72:41.24]Thank you so much.
[72:53.49]How do you throw shit?
[72:56.66]Just want to throw shit at people for a little bit.
[72:58.45]Alright, my next quest is... Out this way quest.
[73:04.09]Find Prim's lawman to get information on where your attackers went.
[73:08.55]My Prim's deputy has been captured by powder gangers in Bison City.
[73:11.97]Yeah, I'll do that.
[73:12.63]I'm done with this one for now.
[73:14.59]Let's go help out the Prim people.
[73:17.18]Whoops.
[73:26.24]Okay.
[73:27.88]World map.
[73:33.48]I guess I can just... I guess I have to go this way.
[73:39.72]Lucky casino!
[73:45.93]Wasn't I just in here and these guys show up?
[73:48.51]What the fuck are you guys doing?
[73:50.07]I need to heal.
[73:52.45]Does anybody in here sell shit?
[73:53.31]I'm just gonna sell shit.
[73:58.08]I'll use my Vermont rifle.
[73:58.74]Which one of you guys can I buy things from?
[74:00.89]Come to the wrong place, Traveler.
[74:01.55]Prim's dying.
[74:01.87]Howdy, partner.
[74:02.15]Welcome to... Vending machine.
[74:17.36]Everyones kinda freaking out right now.
[74:20.94]Don't really know why.
[74:23.54]Can one of you sell me things?
[74:27.44]Please?
[74:30.38]Please, somebody sell me things instead of running around in circles.
[74:32.98]Do you have anything for sale?
[74:39.82]Here we go.
[74:42.46]Okay, here.
[74:42.82]Take this.
[74:43.14]I don't want this shit.
[74:43.94]You have it.
[74:47.40]Do you have any Stimpaks?
[74:48.34]Everybody has Stimpaks.
[74:51.04]There we go.
[74:54.86]100!
[74:54.88]100 each!
[74:58.13]I don't have that kind of money.
[75:02.31]What?
[75:04.75]Yeah, take the revolver.
[75:05.69]I don't even want it.
[75:12.82]Um.
[75:13.94]What do you squirrels do?
[75:24.98]Forceps charge.
[75:28.08]Okay, well, there's one.
[75:31.18]What a dumbass.
[75:32.00]Okay, take an egg, too.
[75:38.60]And take this knife.
[75:39.90]Take both these troublemaker outfits.
[75:41.81]No!
[75:42.51]I want to use that because it's +2 to melee.
[75:46.65]Take this dumb hat.
[75:50.61]Okay.
[75:52.37]Now, let me put that on.
[75:59.74]Steal from him?
[76:00.48]You need more health?
[76:01.16]I do.
[76:03.68]+2.
[76:07.90]Ugh.
[76:09.12]Sugar bombs.
[76:10.06]I mean... Look at my health.
[76:13.76]Are you serious?
[76:16.71]How the fuck am I supposed to beat any of those guys?
[76:19.27]I have no money.
[76:32.03]You just you have to steal in this game.
[76:33.63]You just do How are you ever supposed to win if you don't steal?
[76:37.99]There's no way I have to like drink a shitload of coca-cola Where can I sleep?
[76:51.79]Is there like a bed I can sleep in?
[76:53.09]Can't you only sleep in beds that you own?
[76:54.64]No, we're going in just fucking balls to the wall.
[76:58.06]I'm gonna kill all these guys.
[76:59.10]I'm gonna put on my Vermont rifle
[77:03.78]I'm gonna get shit-faced.
[77:08.48]And we're going in hard.
[77:10.12]Need a bunch of this stuff.
[77:15.46]Weapons.
[77:19.86]Uh... Do I have bullets for this thing?
[77:25.59]I do.
[77:25.83]Let's go.
[77:28.97]I'm going in hot.
[77:32.45]Alright, boys.
[77:34.75]Let's do it.
[77:35.19]Nice shot.
[77:45.89]What the fuck?
[77:50.89]I can't do it.
[77:55.62]Come on, shoot him in the fucking head.
[78:08.51]Alright, we're gonna... Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[78:10.23]Important.
[78:14.89]Rush him!
[78:15.23]I thought that was me.
[78:19.01]I thought that was my head.
[78:25.56]I thought I swung and my head came off.
[78:38.83]Get some dirty water.
[78:43.34]Okay.
[78:43.80]I can chill for a second.
[78:55.06]Just gotta be really quiet.
[78:57.96]The best part about this is it don't even matter.
[79:00.88]You can just take whatever you want.
[79:03.78]Except, no.
[79:04.18]I'm not taking any of these stupid books.
[79:05.62]Here we go.
[79:12.91]Anything in the register?
[79:13.69]Yeah.
[79:20.12]Big dick is back in town.
[79:22.38]What?
[79:24.04]Am I even going the right way?
[79:30.77]I have no idea.
[79:34.39]Did I do what I was supposed to do in here?
[79:41.48]But I don't know.
[79:42.22]I'm just going to explore.
[79:51.21]Kind of dark.
[80:07.32]Yeah, isn't that where I am?
[80:12.59]Locked very hard.
[80:17.69]Shit.
[80:25.51]Take it all.
[80:36.20]Doctor bag?
[80:37.38]What's in the do- Ooh, level two!
[80:40.88]Thirteen skill points.
[80:47.25]You got it!
[80:51.22]With the intense training perk, you can put a single point into any of your special attributes.
[80:57.66]Plus 10% damage against female opponents.
[81:03.38]So, I get to, like... I get to be, like, a ladies' man now?
[81:10.70]Uh...
[81:17.17]Confirmed Bachelor?
[81:18.35]In combat, you do 10% damage against male opponents.
[81:24.53]Maybe I should just do intense training and put a point into strength.
[81:26.71]That's what I'm going to do.
[81:33.00]I feel like I need to... If I'm going to be melee guy, I might as well have strong arms, right?
[81:43.48]Two Stimpaks.
[81:44.12]Thank God.
[81:48.13]Yeah, give me the vacuum cleaner.
[81:49.39]That's what I want.
[81:53.95]What?
[81:57.72]Come on!
[81:58.26]Easy.
[82:02.68]Easy.
[82:19.17]Drinking out of the toilet.
[82:19.99]Oh, I'm gonna drink water.
[82:22.69]I'm gonna be full of radiation, but it's free.
[82:25.05]Free energy.
[82:32.91]That face when he doesn't take the butt stuff?
[82:37.27]What does that mean?
[82:42.41]Game doesn't suck?
[82:47.29]Alright.
[82:49.27]Anything else in here?
[82:52.39]Fork?
[82:53.25]Can I use a fork as a melee weapon?
[82:55.42]That'd be kind of fun.
[82:56.90]What happened to this guy's bed?
[82:58.44]I thought that was snow for a second.
[83:01.18]I really did.
[83:01.60]I thought it was snowing.
[83:09.91]Nothing in here.
[83:11.47]Just a broken mirror.
[83:12.41]Whoa.
[83:14.55]Uh-oh.
[83:27.12]It's so stupid.
[83:28.82]I love it.
[83:30.36]Wait, what?
[83:32.71]Jaunty Juggernaut.
[83:34.97]The Juggernaut.
[83:35.71]Just resubscribe.
[83:36.81]Thank you, dude.
[83:38.89]Thank you, Juggernaut.
[83:41.63]People over there.

[84:02.30]What about you?
[84:10.87]What's wrong with me?
[84:13.05]Why do I keep having episodes?
[84:22.73]Get fucked up.
[84:23.57]Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

[84:34.09]Thank you.
[84:35.15]One more.
[84:35.59]Done.
[84:53.53]Now I'm gonna reap all the spoils of war.
[85:00.34]God, that is so... Head is just freaking me out right now.
[85:10.97]Some squirrel stew.
[85:12.73]What's wrong with me?
[85:16.27]I'm addicted to something, aren't I?
[85:17.51]What am I addicted to?
[85:22.64]Doctor's bag?
[85:24.96]Ah, no, no, no.
[85:25.74]I got a fucked up head.
[85:28.13]Alright, we're good to go now.
[85:34.77]Am I doing a full playthrough?
[85:35.81]I don't know.
[85:37.51]Just felt like turning the stream on and felt like playing this game.
[85:42.67]Because I never played it and I was actually talking to Hypo.
[85:47.88]last week about just this series in general and that I never really played this one.
[85:53.12]And I was like, you know what?
[85:56.34]I haven't fucking played this game.
[85:57.92]Ever.
[85:58.90]So why not?
[86:06.55]Suitcase.
[86:09.95]Drugs and cherry bombs.
[86:13.63]Look at all these drugs.
[86:15.41]So many drugs here.
[86:18.27]Somebody that had this room was not... Not... Oh, skeleton!
[86:25.80]Gross.
[86:26.58]Is that how he died?
[86:28.87]He took too many drugs and turned into a skeleton.
[86:32.31]That sucks for you, dude.
[86:34.15]Sorry about that.
[86:38.98]Sorry.
[86:47.51]So that way?
[86:50.81]I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking for here.
[86:56.42]There's a guy that's in the Bison Steve Hotel.
[87:00.12]Where?
[87:01.62]Where are you?
[87:04.12]You punk.
[87:07.06]Did I go this way?
[87:08.14]I'm getting lost.
[87:11.33]Kind of.
[87:11.93]No, I think I already came this way.
[87:13.31]Yeah, that's because I thought it was snowing in there.
[87:16.87]Sleep to regain health.
[87:18.01]Yeah, I know.
[87:19.91]I know.
[87:20.23]What the hell?
[87:30.53]Where is he?
[87:36.60]Prim's deputy has been captured by powder gangers and Bison Steve and needs to be rescued.
[87:40.96]Isn't that where I am?
[87:43.26]Did I not go in a certain door?
[87:45.14]Wait, what?
[87:46.88]Peter G. Peter G. Three months.
[87:50.08]Welcome back.
[87:53.86]Thank you for your subscription.
[88:03.77]Okay, I don't think I'm here now.
[88:06.59]Down?
[88:09.35]It's on the first floor.
[88:10.31]Why the hell would it be on the first...
[88:22.21]I don't like how dark this is.
[88:23.19]This is seriously dark.
[88:32.48]Fixer.
[88:34.82]Restore all body parts.
[88:35.94]Okay, I need to hold on to that dirty water.
[88:40.06]Who's there?
[88:52.08]Kill him!
[88:56.19]I want his outfit.
[88:57.33]That's really important.
[88:58.09]Give me your whole outfit.
[89:06.75]Merc veteran.
[89:09.00]Gonna put on the veteran, right?
[89:13.78]Ball cap with glasses.
[89:15.06]I kinda want that.
[89:16.68]Just a little bit.
[89:26.70]Okay, I'm going to eat some crunchy mutt fruit.
[89:30.33]Whatever the hell that was.
[89:31.03]I'm so dead.
[89:44.03]There's a cow in here.
[89:52.47]How many?
[89:54.34]How many?
[89:55.30]Two?
[90:09.51]What?
[90:11.11]What?
[90:11.73]Just, why did it not explode?
[90:13.11]It didn't explode.
[90:15.91]That didn't even explode.
[90:17.07]Okay.
[90:32.41]Where is it?
[90:40.15]Damage 10.
[90:40.71]I'm probably going to repair them.
[90:44.13]What does more damage?
[90:47.64]A cleaver.
[90:57.33]I'll try the cleaver.
[91:00.87]That's pretty sick.
[91:06.06]Long fuse.
[91:08.42]Okay, now it makes sense.
[91:10.42]Now it makes sense.
[91:15.64]I wish you could throw these things, man.
[91:18.08]I'd love to just fucking toss this into somebody's head so badly.

[92:01.71]Got ya!
[92:10.25]Where'd my cleaver go?
[92:11.17]There it is.
[92:16.55]That didn't hit anybody.
[92:17.31]If I don't kill the leader, then they'll all stop fighting.
[92:22.13]I feel like I'm playing Left 4 Dead.
[92:30.69]Oh, what the fuck?
[92:41.71]the 10 charisma 10 luck character is not a not a character that's gonna be very good I would assume if I were a betting man with my nuka cola yeah I'm gonna have to use a shitty gun
[93:12.89]Let's do some shooting.
[93:17.85]We can use the FailFish now.
[93:18.97]Yeah, you can.
[93:24.23]Heal up.
[93:25.59]Heal up.
[93:26.53]Give me that heal.

[93:33.22]Did I?
[93:34.20]Did I do a Homer Simpson?
[93:44.26]Seriously, just shoot me right in the fucking head.

[93:57.63]What a bad shot, huh?
[93:59.67]Okay, now I'm pulling out the cleaver.
[94:05.81]Where's my, like, cripple?
[94:12.13]Oh my fucking god!

[94:21.78]This character is so bad.
[94:23.26]Oh, reset.
[94:35.38]Reset.
[94:36.36]Reset.
[94:43.45]I need to heal again.
[94:44.87]This is like the first area too.
[94:56.24]Where is my... Alright, no more fucking around.
[95:08.43]It's time to kill somebody.
[95:16.94]I gotta save after this, too.
[95:21.80]Uh, save.
[95:23.08]Here we go.
[95:23.68]That does more damage.
[95:30.13]Seven damage.
[95:30.99]Don't I have?
[95:31.53]This is twelve.
[95:34.63]I'm gonna use this.
[95:35.19]I feel like this is gonna hurt more.
[95:41.54]Gun sucks.
[95:45.10]I'm going to have to have a lot of friends to finish this playthrough.
[95:49.73]You know, I'm going to take some drugs, too.
[96:02.79]Let's do some drugs.
[96:06.13]I'm going to have to get right in the head.
[96:09.45]Just throwing fucking dynamite.
[96:10.95]You're kidding me right now.
[96:12.71]Here, he killed himself.
[96:14.03]He just killed his friend.
[96:15.85]Nice close-up.
[96:19.39]He's dead.
[96:19.75]Alright, good.
[96:21.73]The leader's dead.
[96:22.45]Outta here.
[96:32.82]See?
[96:33.42]I took the drugs and I'm good.
[96:40.82]Uh-oh.
[96:44.14]Don't do drugs, kids.
[96:45.00]They make you a skeleton.
[96:46.04]That's true.
[96:49.16]Do not do drugs.
[96:55.61]Yeah, melee weapon.
[96:57.19]See you later.
[96:58.87]At least for now.
[96:59.71]Holy shit.
[97:00.51]You can't kill anybody with a melee weapon.
[97:03.63]You just die.
[97:04.33]At least until I get a better weapon.
[97:09.63]Okay, that's the guy I'm supposed to save.
[97:11.11]Almost just killed him.
[97:12.69]I don't suppose you came here to rescue me.
[97:15.25]I'd cross my fingers, but my hands are numb.
[97:20.05]Hey, Deputy Beagle.
[97:21.41]It's a pleasure to meet you.
[97:23.34]I'm in a bit of a predicament here.
[97:31.82]Indeed I do, good sir.
[97:33.36]And I would be thrilled to share that information with you as soon as I am released from captivity.
[97:38.29]Let's go mainline.
[97:39.67]Oh, hold on a second.
[97:40.65]Hold on a second.
[97:43.49]You can tell me or you can rot in here forever.
[97:46.13]Alright.
[97:46.41]Alright.
[97:46.75]Mm-hmm.
[97:46.99]Thank you.
[97:47.77]Mm-hmm.
[97:47.93]Yeah.
[97:48.05]Thanks for the info, dickhead.
[98:16.91]Yeah, you stay with me and fight with me.
[98:21.10]Alright.
[98:24.72]We gotta get you a weapon.
[98:25.34]Take a weapon.
[98:25.90]Take some money for a weapon.
[98:48.14]Take one money.
[98:49.04]No, you don't give me all your shit.
[98:53.94]All of it.
[98:56.90]Okay, you get... You get... How much did I give him?
[99:04.68]You can get one dynamite.
[99:09.18]Make sure you use it wisely.
[99:10.34]He just has it on his... Oh, God.
[99:20.18]walking right now.
[99:25.78]I'm gonna heal my broken head.
[99:28.85]Did I toggle run?
[99:30.75]How the hell did I do this?
[99:34.45]Let's go.
[99:34.77]Follow me.
[99:35.07]Let's go.
[99:36.83]What the fuck did I toggle?
[99:52.56]No, it's not caps lock.
[99:56.51]Oh, I'm overburdened.
[99:57.27]Alright.
[99:57.89]I'm just going to throw some of those weapons on the ground.
[100:02.89]Throw these on the fucking ground.
[100:04.33]Except give me one of them.
[100:10.74]Give me the one that actually is repaired.
[100:16.77]Oh, I can repair it.
[100:21.91]Incinerator?
[100:22.55]Should I give him the incinerator?
[100:26.73]Six tire irons.
[100:27.97]God.
[100:28.35]Do I still have a burden?
[100:34.60]No.
[100:39.54]Alright.
[100:40.68]Let's go.
[100:45.78]I'm gonna need you to do some work here, man.
[100:49.59]I need to lock... Can you open that door?
[100:51.75]Go get that door open.
[100:53.59]If we were to miss... No radio?
[101:03.35]No, no radio.
[101:06.41]I think I killed everybody in here, by the way.
[101:07.97]Because nobody left for him to fight.
[101:13.81]You better believe this guy's killing somebody if we get surrounded or something.
[101:18.35]What's he doing?
[101:24.86]He's just staring at this guy.
[101:25.94]Is that a friend of yours or something?
[101:26.98]What are you doing?
[101:30.68]Kind of look like me.
[101:31.42]Let's go.
[101:35.60]25 lockpick.
[101:36.40]Fuck off.
[101:39.03]Why is Deputy Vigil in his drawers?
[101:40.71]Because I took the clothes off of him.
[101:44.41]I needed them.
[101:44.91]They're important.
[101:54.66]Come on, he needs to use that dynamite on somebody.
[101:59.62]Hey there.
[101:59.98]Why are you holding that?
[102:07.00]What are you doing?
[102:07.58]Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[102:11.06]He's holding the fucking fuse, too.
[102:14.86]This dude's not just gonna go drop that in there, is he?
[102:17.68]I feel like I gotta put a stop to this, don't I?
[102:24.20]This dude is about to go on a rampage.
[102:30.26]He's got big hands, too.
[102:32.40]That's not even his voice.
[102:38.98]Uh-oh.
[102:40.64]Uh-oh.
[102:45.74]He's got the dynamite.
[102:50.74]I'm gonna have to stop him.
[102:51.72]He's gonna kill everybody.
[102:59.20]Throw the dynamite!
[103:03.52]Throw the dynamite, please!
[103:05.20]Why didn't he throw the dynamite?
[103:14.55]Hold on, hold on, I gotta get... Throw it!
[103:20.28]Throw it, please!
[103:21.88]Throw it!
[103:23.58]Throw it!
[103:25.46]No!
[103:29.91]He has to throw that dynamite.
[103:32.29]He has to.
[103:33.59]It's so important.
[103:36.09]Wait, what?
[103:38.07]Raging A-Burn.
[103:41.27]Thank you for subscribing.
[103:42.97]Why is he walking like this?
[103:50.05]Throw it!
[103:51.69]Throw the dynamite at me.
[103:54.07]Fucking no.
[103:55.93]Throw it.
[103:57.17]You have such an advantage.
[103:59.92]He's not gonna throw it.
[104:07.91]You throw some dynamite.
[104:08.99]You know what?
[104:09.49]Fuck it.
[104:09.99]Fine.
[104:11.47]If you won't do it, I will.
[104:17.97]See what I'm doing?
[104:19.13]You see what I'm doing?
[104:20.03]I need you to emulate what I'm doing right now.
[104:22.12]Frank.
[104:22.76]Dan.
[104:23.60]Deagle.
[104:24.10]Beagle.
[104:25.54]He's gonna just play fucking computer games.
[104:38.79]Where is he?
[104:43.60]No shit.
[104:58.07]Okay, alright.
[104:59.01]Time to chill.
[105:01.07]Time to chill.
[105:06.21]I gotta do it one more time.
[105:08.79]Gotta do it one more time.
[105:15.88]How do I piss this guy off enough to where he's gonna just drop that dynamite?
[105:18.70]It has to be away.
[105:22.24]Maybe if I irritate him and I'm far enough away.
[105:25.32]I'm gonna try that.
[105:26.16]Last try, I'm going to... I'm gonna piss him off.
[105:30.58]Far away.
[105:32.14]So he's gonna turn and throw it.
[105:34.93]That's what's gonna work.
[105:36.29]See?
[105:36.55]Now he's gonna... He did it!
[105:38.23]He actually did it!
[105:47.07]Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[105:51.20]Hold on, important.
[105:52.56]Important.
[105:58.00]Okay, hold on a second.
[105:59.06]This is gonna be good.
[106:01.62]He's gonna wipe everybody out over here.
[106:07.75]come on what what what it didn't hurt it didn't fucking hurt anybody it didn't hurt one fucking person you fucking that's such dumb shit
[106:41.31]It doesn't hurt anyone.
[106:49.36]Friendly fire is off, apparently.
[106:50.98]I got to do it again.
[106:55.22]I got to do it.
[106:55.86]I got to just make sure.
[106:56.78]I have to know for certain.
[107:09.61]Poobo, thank you so much for subscribing.
[107:12.61]Welcome, man.
[107:16.07]It did hurt people, but dynamite isn't good.
[107:17.87]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[107:23.78]Can you tell me about the man in the checkered suit?
[107:26.24]Yeah.
[107:36.85]I was performing recon gathering information on some of the powder gangers.
[107:43.09]They were talking about some delivery.
[107:45.19]They said they'd be heading through Nipton to know.
[107:47.91]Hey, thanks for the info.
[107:49.03]Wait, wait, wait.
[107:49.73]Hello again.
[107:54.57]It should be someone brave like you, but more of a homebody.
[107:58.11]Someone who will settle down and watch over us.
[108:00.69]Okay.
[108:00.97]I heard the powder gangers talking about.
[108:03.73]Also.
[108:06.70]I don't have time to help.
[108:08.40]I'll help bring the law back to prim.
[108:12.93]I'll bring the law back.
[108:13.75]I thought that just said incinerated.
[108:16.11]Alright.
[108:16.37]Thank you for the info.
[108:17.19]Appreciate it.
[108:41.45]I had to do it one more time.
[108:42.69]I had to do it one more time.
[108:48.19]Pull out the...
[109:01.10]Snowman taters Welcome dude.
[109:03.06]Thank you so much.
[109:04.52]Watch out I was so dead.
[109:07.56]They don't have to watch out anymore.
[109:10.66]I
[109:32.42]I fucking love this game, man.
[109:35.40]Okay.
[109:41.30]Quests.
[109:43.34]My kind of town.
[109:43.94]Beagle wants a new sheriff prim.
[109:45.51]He suggested an ex-sheriff.
[109:52.89]Where is just the main quest?
[110:00.30]I'll do this one.
[110:00.80]They went that way.
[110:01.32]Head to Novak through Nipton.
[110:04.54]White Fang L. Three months, dude.
[110:07.34]Thank you.
[110:08.94]Very much appreciated.
[110:13.60]Alright, we're going to go that way.
[110:14.88]I kind of don't really care about this place anymore.
[110:17.03]This place sucks.
[110:17.89]Game sucks.
[110:21.59]Okay.
[110:22.53]So, it looks like we're going to be going...
[110:25.53]Down here to Nipton.
[110:28.67]Or, like, up there to Goodsprings.
[110:30.19]I want to go to Nipton.
[110:30.85]Let's just go this way.
[110:34.27]This may go way down.
[110:39.42]When I respawned, I lost the progress of talking to him.
[110:43.48]Didn't I save it after all that shit?
[110:45.86]Pretty sure I did, didn't I?
[110:49.92]Yeah, because he wants a new sheriff for Prim.
[110:51.37]He's like, no, I'm good.
[110:53.27]I'm good.
[110:57.79]I need to find a town.
[111:04.65]Who's shooting at me?
[111:08.51]Are you kidding me, man?
[111:11.86]You're just going to shoot me from up there?
[111:16.44]Are we just going to have a moron fight right now?
[111:19.12]None of us are going to die.
[111:29.67]I've got a better idea.
[111:38.81]Get out of here.
[111:40.15]Gum?
[111:52.47]Like tea.
[111:54.19]Go milk tea.
[111:57.45]Thanks, dude.
[111:57.91]Welcome.
[111:59.67]Thank you for subscribing.
[112:03.25]You are so awesome.
[112:16.06]Boat fly meat.
[112:16.66]Pick it up.
[112:20.42]Where's the other corpse?
[112:21.08]I don't know.
[112:24.16]Gum like tea.
[112:28.28]It's hard for me to read things over on this other monitor, guys.
[112:30.74]I'm sorry.
[112:34.36]And Tojo.
[112:37.80]P. Welcome back.
[112:40.58]Four months, man.
[112:42.18]It's our four month subscription anniversary.
[112:51.29]I'm going to probably run into shit that I don't want to run into.
[112:55.31]Who picks up meat?
[112:56.25]Me.
[112:56.45]I'm gonna eat it.
[112:56.87]Uh-oh.
[113:00.95]Dust cloud.
[113:08.87]Swing at me.
[113:09.23]What are you doing?
[113:14.95]Something else here, too.
[113:18.89]Oh, that's just his leg.
[113:19.69]I thought that was another bug.
[113:26.92]What's going on, Svalfar?
[113:29.20]Welcome to the chat.
[113:34.29]I'm so happy you're playing this.
[113:35.47]I'm the happiest person ever.
[113:40.37]Yeah, we're having a good time.
[113:45.91]Mr. Banana Sham.
[113:48.46]Or Mr. Banana's Ham.
[113:49.68]Thanks, man.
[113:50.44]Welcome back.
[113:51.22]That's three months.
[113:52.06]That's a triple.
[113:56.04]What?
[113:59.14]Whoa!
[114:00.80]Mud throwers.
[114:02.74]These things are fucked.
[114:06.75]Ugh!
[114:08.83]What the hell are you?
[114:11.62]Is this a Resident Evil game or is this Fallout?
[114:13.30]Seriously.
[114:15.64]Oh, God.
[114:17.54]Thank you, my animal friends.
[114:20.30]You've done a great service.
[114:22.68]Oh, he's mad.
[114:23.08]He's mad.
[114:24.13]He's mad.
[114:24.41]He's not at least never nice.
[114:25.39]I'm going to have to take out the gun.
[114:28.47]Hold on a second.
[114:28.83]I'm going to have to take out a gun.
[114:32.47]I didn't want to have to do this.
[114:33.57]No.
[114:37.71]No.
[114:38.45]Get away from me.
[114:43.04]Oh shit.
[114:44.54]Oh shit.
[114:48.48]What the fuck is going on?
[115:00.35]What the fuck?
[115:02.51]No, I'm gonna be back in this.
[115:09.86]Oh, that was amazing.
[115:14.25]Why does this game have to be so fun?
[115:17.69]I thought they were friends.
[115:18.69]I thought they killed the giant Resident Evil monster for me.
[115:21.81]Hold on a sec.
[115:31.81]I'm gonna have to eat some sunflower seeds after that one.
[115:34.65]It's too much.
[115:35.25]I need some more energy.
[115:42.07]Okay.
[115:43.41]Let's get some composure here.
[115:45.15]Yes, that's silly mode.
[115:46.03]That is silly mode.
[115:46.73]You're right.
[115:51.07]Where the hell am I going?
[115:53.99]Vios Mojave.
[116:00.49]Vios Mojave.
[116:03.57]Vios Mojojo.
[116:04.76]Thanks for two months, man.
[116:05.90]Appreciate it.
[116:06.94]Welcome back.
[116:08.72]Just get fucked.
[116:12.41]No, I wanted to just look at the map.
[116:16.07]So I need to go down here.
[116:18.43]Set the marker there.
[116:20.41]Get me out of this dumb town.
[116:25.00]What the fuck is going on?
[116:27.52]Slow down.
[116:28.32]Don't move.
[116:29.98]Okay.
[116:30.90]Alright.
[116:31.42]I see.
[116:32.42]Yep.
[116:33.82]You don't think I can see that shit?
[116:36.80]Nice and easy.
[116:37.50]I'm going to move around it.
[116:41.46]Fucking assholes.
[116:44.12]Oh, oh.
[116:46.72]Oh.
[116:48.93]Hey.
[116:49.25]Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
[117:16.34]Got him!
[117:18.62]Give me all your shit.
[117:36.31]Missiles, damn.
[117:37.27]Three missiles.
[117:39.27]Nice.
[117:44.30]Well...
[117:58.20]This is going to be a short playthrough.
[117:59.44]It probably is.
[118:01.77]Oh, where's the good one?
[118:02.39]It's this one.
[118:12.52]Still have... What?
[118:13.38]Come on.
[118:19.78]I have so much dumb shit.
[118:21.10]Just get rid of it.
[118:21.58]I don't even want it.
[118:22.46]I don't want half this crap.
[118:31.00]Is that good?
[118:31.44]We good?
[118:32.52]We're good.
[118:38.58]That's my knife.
[118:41.46]And off we go.
[118:47.64]I need to go this way, right?
[118:49.39]Yeah, that way.
[118:51.71]Can I get over here?
[118:52.77]This way?
[118:59.94]Wait, what?
[119:03.64]Elliot Bot, Elio Bot.
[119:04.98]Thank you so much for resubscribing.
[119:07.97]And Cecil Harvey.
[119:08.91]Cecil underscore Harvey underscore.
[119:11.27]Thanks for subbing, guys.
[119:25.87]Where are you from?
[119:26.47]I'm from a hub originally, but it's been a long time since I saw it.
[119:30.01]I'm on my second tour here.
[119:31.29]Running around naked, nude strats.
[119:37.11]I would do nude strats, but I get +2 to melee.
[119:42.19]Wait, what?
[119:45.96]Canoss is back.
[119:46.58]Whoa, easy, buddy.
[119:46.94]Seven months.
[119:47.26]That's almost a year.
[119:56.24]That's a long time.
[119:59.52]Thank you so much.
[120:00.04]What are these two doing?
[120:02.86]That's a very long, long list of things that you are.
[120:15.75]We know Prim is a great strategic point, and we aren't blind to the needs of the town, but we're barely holding our own against the powder gangers.
[120:22.53]We don't have the guns or the personnel needed to carry out our mission, much less take on defending this town as well.
[120:31.84]I really don't care.
[120:35.00]Half a year is almost a year to Jerma.
[120:36.52]It is.
[120:36.80]It's a long time to me.
[120:40.52]Why is everybody telling me not to do this?
[120:41.92]A lot of people were like, don't do this, these guys are assholes.
[120:45.54]Alright, guy's putting me to sleep now.
[120:46.45]I gotta bring him bodies.
[120:47.19]Okay.
[121:07.66]Anything in these boxes?
[121:08.40]Let's just go.
[121:09.02]I'm not going to fuck around anymore.
[121:12.31]I want to play the game.
[121:16.87]Alright.
[121:18.79]I have some things I can do.
[121:23.77]I do want to get down here.
[121:29.50]Can I get through this gate?
[121:31.64]This way?
[121:31.94]Do I have to go all the way around?
[121:32.94]I hope I don't have to go all the way around.
[121:34.46]Please don't tell me I have to do that.
[121:37.86]It's got to be like a way you can sneak around or jump up there and just jump off, right?
[121:45.05]Shit.
[121:49.09]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[121:49.97]Hold on.
[121:51.09]Hold on.
[121:59.82]Jump it.
[122:03.56]My character is such a piece of crap.
[122:05.08]This guy sucks so bad.
[122:07.27]Excuse me.
[122:17.41]Faster of you just... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[122:18.77]I know.
[122:21.41]Ooh, a drive-in.
[122:22.79]Who wants to go see a movie?
[122:23.53]Anyone want to see a movie?
[122:27.55]I'm crippled.
[122:28.47]No, I'm not.
[122:30.21]Guys are walking fine.
[122:33.91]Alright, let's go.
[122:35.61]I am going to use some items.
[122:37.31]I don't want to die again out here.
[122:50.19]Whatever, give me some fruit too.
[122:51.17]Who cares?
[122:54.61]My chest is crippled?
[122:56.96]How do you get a crippled chest?
[122:59.92]It looks like somebody dropped a barbell on you.
[123:04.60]Did somebody throw a brick at me?
[123:05.74]Is that what happened?
[123:08.38]You got a broken bod.
[123:13.49]This time... I'm not going to die by the bison.
[123:27.67]Okay, where, where, where?
[123:28.81]Hold on.
[123:30.49]Watch out for the sand snakes.
[123:43.90]Scorpions.
[123:44.28]Aren't there huge versions of these in these games?
[123:46.74]If I remember correctly.
[123:56.36]I love how it's slow-mo's like that for no reason sometimes.
[123:59.93]There was no reason for that.
[124:08.89]Straight down.
[124:12.06]Holding the Pip-Boy button toggles flashlight.
[124:13.70]Yep.
[124:16.18]I did know that.
[124:26.91]I'm hearing bad... Alright.
[124:29.39]Let's not have a repeat of what happened last time.
[124:33.25]He's not following me anymore.
[124:40.23]Thank God.
[124:45.24]I really was surprised that these were hostile.
[124:49.70]I guess this isn't World of Warcraft.
[124:52.34]The animals aren't just neutral.
[124:54.56]Stay the fuck away from me.
[124:58.10]Black Eagle 1250.
[124:59.64]Thanks for the two months.
[125:04.74]Where did... Where did you come from?
[125:08.86]Well, that was... You're dead.
[125:11.42]No, she's still alive.
[125:12.08]They're eating her.
[125:13.14]Good.
[125:13.52]She was a distractant.
[125:14.23]I don't know who that was.
[125:14.83]It was apparently somebody.
[125:17.47]It's right over here.
[125:27.89]Hello, Swiss cake roll.
[125:29.66]How are you?
[125:30.04]I'm going to sneak in the back.
[125:36.78]What am I doing here?
[125:37.78]What's the quest?
[125:39.92]Head to Novak through Nipton.
[125:41.30]Ask around Novak about your attackers.
[125:42.74]It's not just to talk to these people.
[125:46.36]Yeah!
[125:47.54]Who won the lottery?
[125:49.06]I did!
[125:50.28]Smell that air!
[125:51.84]Couldn't you just drink it like booze?
[125:57.04]You alright?
[125:57.92]You okay?
[126:00.12]This guy's messed up.
[126:01.86]He's probably on drugs.
[126:04.84]What lottery?
[126:06.22]The lottery!
[126:07.06]That's what lottery!
[126:08.38]Are you stupid?
[126:09.72]Don't call me stupid.
[126:10.44]Alright, this guy's gonna die.
[126:12.34]This guy's dead.
[126:13.78]This guy's dead, by the way.
[126:14.86]Okay, I gotta go.
[126:17.28]You know what?
[126:18.24]I got a feeling this guy is gonna have a really bad day.
[126:40.74]We're going to go over to buffaloes and bisons and he's just going to get trampled.
[126:43.41]It's going to be hilarious.
[126:47.69]Any second now a scorpion is going to come out and just sting him.
[126:53.57]Watch this.
[126:58.20]He's scared now.
[126:58.84]He ran out here.
[126:59.34]I don't know why he's doing this.
[127:00.46]He's having a mental breakdown.
[127:10.88]Give me a scorpion over here.
[127:14.27]Scorpion.
[127:15.25]Hello.
[127:20.81]Come.
[127:21.23]Follow me.
[127:21.75]Follow me.
[127:21.99]I'm going to be the Pied Piper.
[127:25.98]Jerma, you idiot.
[127:26.62]It's not that lottery.
[127:27.70]Idiot.
[127:28.00]Jerma.
[127:28.46]Idiot.
[127:35.26]Okay.
[127:35.72]Let's see what happens.
[127:39.29]Now you get up and run.
[127:40.23]Please, really.
[127:44.37]You screwed up everything.
[127:47.91]Okay.
[127:48.93]Buddy.
[127:50.04]I'm just going to shoot, you know.
[128:02.62]Is he not dead?
[128:04.46]Alright, give me his ticket.
[128:06.92]Lottery ticket.
[128:07.62]Got it.
[128:09.40]Punk.
[128:12.06]Good natured.
[128:14.82]Not anymore, apparently.
[128:18.98]So I'm assuming I can bring that ticket to the town and get shit for it?
[128:25.17]Oh my gosh.
[128:27.49]This used to be a good natured stream.
[128:29.19]Yeah, it was.
[128:36.41]I gotta ask around this town, right?
[128:43.82]Go kill Easy Pete.
[128:44.86]He's so far away at this point that I could care less about that guy now.
[128:56.89]What am I doing?
[128:57.43]Just go talk to somebody.
[128:58.59]What the hell am I doing?
[128:59.27]Why am I doing this?
[129:01.51]Stop.
[129:01.95]Stop it.
[129:03.27]That's enough.
[129:03.65]I've had quite enough of that.
[129:19.63]Oh.
[129:20.95]I guess there's somebody back here.
[129:27.95]Or is there?
[129:33.51]What is this marker trying to show me?
[129:37.94]Can I get hit by a train?
[129:38.80]That'd be so awesome.
[129:47.90]Go to the big town hall building?
[129:49.08]Yeah.
[129:49.96]That's probably where I gotta go.
[129:51.04]Hey, look.
[129:59.79]There we are.
[130:00.19]People.
[130:05.46]Oh, God.
[130:06.14]Yeah.
[130:06.62]Okay.
[130:08.96]We got a bunch of raiders.
[130:12.04]How am I gonna make it through this?
[130:36.76]Run.
[130:37.50]Run.
[130:38.60]Run away.
[130:44.71]Uh, they're all crippled.
[130:46.63]My rifle.
[130:51.99]Nice miss.
[130:52.53]What the hell am I doing?
[130:55.32]2%?
[130:56.42]So... Wow.
[130:58.12]That is awful.
[130:58.80]I think it... Don't worry.
[131:14.78]I won't have you lashed across with the rest of these degenerates.
[131:19.48]Okay.
[131:19.81]They all sprinted out like they were going to come after me.
[131:22.77]You guys saw that.
[131:23.91]I can't believe they're still going to talk to me.
[131:28.13]They don't remember me.
[131:28.81]Uh...
[131:46.15]Who should I be talking to and being a part of in this game?
[131:53.60]Holstering is basically saying, you're sorry.
[131:58.44]What do you do?
[131:59.24]Where to begin?
[132:00.92]That they are weak and we are strong?
[132:04.11]But the depths of their moral sickness, their dissolution?
[132:08.15]Mm-hmm.
[132:09.77]Nipton was a wicked place.
[132:11.17]I don't like this guy.
[132:12.03]Devast and corrupt.
[132:14.55]Prof...
[132:16.13]I don't like him.
[132:17.07]Don't like him.
[132:18.69]I heard enough.
[132:19.91]Yeah, not a fan.
[132:23.87]Not a fan of you guys.
[132:28.45]That's for sure.
[132:29.85]Except, I don't know.
[132:31.35]Never mind.
[132:32.21]I thought that guy had a bird.
[132:33.67]I was about to change my mind.
[132:35.71]Seriously thought he had a pet crow.
[132:37.33]And I would have probably joined their legion.
[132:45.97]These are the guys that I crippled when I threw the dynamite.
[132:48.23]I was just walking around like they have shit in their pants.
[132:53.80]Ah, damn, what happened to us?
[132:55.32]I don't know.
[132:56.90]All I remember is my legs not working.
[133:03.50]Where did they all go?
[133:04.20]Should I throw another piece of dynamite?
[133:13.39]I'm gonna.
[133:14.69]Fuck these people.
[133:21.04]Let's do it.
[133:22.22]What's in the top left?
[133:24.16]Am I going insane?
[133:34.86]Alright, I'm gonna hide.
[133:36.75]Oh, the dogs are after me now.
[133:38.93]I think the jig is up.
[133:41.11]The jig might be up.
[133:42.75]Save.
[133:43.99]Save it, save it, save it, save it, save it.
[133:58.31]I gotta go.
[133:58.69]I gotta run.
[133:59.80]I'm not gonna make it out of this alive.
[134:06.44]Oh boy, I'm crippled.
[134:10.56]Do I have a stim?
[134:13.02]I don't.
[134:20.09]I'll get away.
[134:20.51]I'll get away.
[134:20.89]I'll get away.
[134:23.03]Watch this.
[134:29.65]They don't seem to be doing anything.
[134:30.69]They're all just following me single file.
[134:38.78]This is pretty anti-climactic, I'm not gonna lie.
[134:40.60]Oh, fuck me.
[134:47.28]Seriously.
[134:49.01]There's like dogs and shit everywhere in here too.
[134:55.73]There was a chainsaw.
[134:56.45]One of these guys has a chainsaw?
[135:10.27]MV Panda.
[135:11.41]Thanks a lot.
[135:11.85]Welcome.
[135:15.81]No, no, no.
[135:16.19]I want to load.
[135:17.21]Load where I was over here.
[135:27.24]Shit.
[135:27.54]Alright, at least I'm not crippled.
[135:31.47]Not crippled right now.
[135:37.80]Use the doctor bag.
[135:38.76]I could do that.
[135:39.36]That's true.
[135:43.64]We're gonna throw... Watch this.
[135:45.12]Watch this technique.
[135:46.52]Bet you've never seen something like this before.
[135:47.98]Didn't do anything.
[135:50.00]Never mind.
[135:53.41]I may have just fucking screwed myself.
[135:55.41]Just being a dumbass.
[136:05.53]I want to hit you in the head.
[136:06.57]And then shoot you in the head.
[136:09.17]No, in the arm.
[136:14.77]Shoot her.
[136:16.45]Shoot!
[136:17.75]God damn, what are you doing?
[136:20.38]Lead them to prim.
[136:21.20]Just run them the whole way.
[136:22.16]That would be kind of funny, actually.
[136:26.22]Reset.
[136:27.38]Reset.
[136:28.48]It's time to reset.
[136:29.28]They're not going to... Yeah, see ya.
[136:31.83]Good luck doing what I just did.
[136:33.93]You're a stupid AI-controlled player.
[136:35.57]Okay.
[136:46.95]So, I'm gonna go back in that building.
[136:48.44]Hopefully by that time, it'll be... Over?
[136:53.50]On the back?
[136:54.00]Why are they back?
[136:57.64]Seriously.
[136:58.32]I thought they all ran away.
[137:03.10]Throw bombs.
[137:03.58]I don't want to use them all.
[137:04.34]I was going for a joke play right there.
[137:18.37]Ah, you didn't think I was going to be able to do that, did you?
[137:20.85]I did.
[137:21.13]Okay.
[137:28.77]I think I'm safe to go down there now.
[137:35.00]Should be.
[137:44.47]I'm gonna use the doctor bag as well.
[137:48.65]Did I use it?
[137:49.73]Yeah, okay.
[137:53.93]Fallout resetting.
[138:00.63]I still need to go in that building.
[138:06.93]Yeah, this character does not have one perception.
[138:11.01]He has like one perception, one agility.
[138:12.87]This character is a piece of crap.
[138:18.11]Actually, maybe I'll pick this guy off.
[138:22.98]He's kind of in the middle of nowhere, isn't he?
[138:25.06]No, he's not.
[138:25.58]Okay, he's not hostile.
[138:26.52]Don't do that.
[138:30.48]He doesn't care anymore.
[138:31.32]Good.
[138:32.00]Hopefully all his friends don't.
[138:32.88]Yep, good.
[138:34.62]We're on good terms now.
[138:50.12]He's doing the stanky leg.
[138:51.18]He kind of was.
[138:59.78]I don't want all their shit.
[139:01.06]I'll just kind of walk through.
[139:07.85]Can't open that door.
[139:08.67]I want to just explore this area.
[139:20.53]I can hear a lot of noises.
[139:24.01]Noises that I don't particularly like.
[139:32.31]Why are these guys... ...not hostile right now?
[139:35.91]Doesn't seem to make much sense.
[139:38.68]God... What the fuck just happened?
[139:43.00]What did... What even just... What even just happened?
[139:45.80]I don't even know.
[139:47.96]There was a bomb... There was a bomb in there.
[139:50.43]Why?
[139:50.59]Is that how all these people died?
[139:55.81]Apparently.
[139:56.21]Yeah, I swear I swept you like a fucking rug.
[140:17.36]It's like jumping into the camera.
[140:21.70]There's another one behind me.
[140:22.48]Why can I not hit you?
[140:26.22]There's a mine behind me.
[140:39.47]I do not want to step in it.
[140:41.12]Oh, a fresh potato.
[140:49.20]That works.
[141:01.38]Sugar bombs.
[141:02.04]Uh, I'd like to heal.
[141:11.38]That'd be great.
[141:18.19]Got him.
[141:20.47]What the fuck are your stats if you have one perception and one agility?
[141:23.35]Ten charisma and ten luck.
[141:27.35]It was such a funny joke in the beginning and now it's really biting me in the ass.
[141:41.04]Yeah, they have meat.
[141:42.38]I'll take them.
[141:42.76]I'm just gonna eat it right now.
[141:55.00]Hmm, okay.
[141:58.37]Does luck even do anything?
[142:00.07]I don't know.
[142:00.51]I think it does, uh...
[142:10.64]Critical Strike stuff.
[142:12.00]And I'm doing melee, so... Dynamite in here, right?
[142:16.75]No bombs on the ground.
[142:18.23]Hopefully not.
[142:29.36]Lock skill 9.
[142:30.54]That is so bad.
[142:56.36]Prison break.
[142:58.08]Should I open the doors or something?
[143:01.39]Reset the mainframe.
[143:03.17]I guess.
[143:03.45]I don't think I'm smart enough to use this computer.
[143:08.03]Ooh.
[143:13.77]There's a pistol in there.
[143:14.56]Look at all these lottery tickets.
[143:23.60]That is a shitload of lottery tickets.
[143:29.35]Anything else that I missed?
[143:30.09]I don't think so.
[143:30.67]I don't want any of this crap.
[143:59.69]Why did I not have those on?
[144:17.42]Why are you playing this?
[144:18.04]What is happening?
[144:18.56]Are you okay?
[144:20.68]I hope I'm okay.
[144:26.17]Can't open that door, so I'm gonna leave.
[144:42.40]Mmm, I hear dogs.
[144:49.57]Ugh.
[144:50.79]Oh, God.
[144:51.71]That was terrible.
[144:55.21]That is also terrible.
[145:00.01]That's terrible a third time.
[145:05.20]I can't believe there are this many dogs down here.
[145:13.58]Surprisingly, I haven't been hit.
[145:16.70]It's so brutal.
[145:20.14]Need to put a new point in.
[145:26.98]Okay.
[145:32.25]Let's go with melee weapons again?
[145:33.87]Or should I do science?
[145:37.65]No, medicine.
[145:38.59]I kind of want to do medicine.
[145:50.46]Guns if you hate melee.
[145:51.68]Are we done with the dogs?
[145:59.49]Can I stop shooting their heads off?
[146:00.65]That would be nice.
[146:01.13]That's a good toilet.
[146:16.10]That's a pretty good toilet water.
[146:20.95]That... My god, these skills.
[146:24.69]Yeah, this was not... This was just a fun, funny character.
[146:28.90]Right?
[146:30.34]I wasn't really taking it seriously.
[146:33.08]If I was going to take it seriously, I would have done... Small guns and... Agility and perception and... No, I'm just going to leave.
[146:48.25]Unless there is... There's nothing else I can do in here, right?
[146:52.06]Maybe there is.
[146:55.22]Maybe there is.
[146:56.02]No, this is the exit.
[147:08.69]Where do I need to go?
[147:13.68]This way.
[147:24.88]Who takes Bethesda games seriously anyways?
[147:30.31]I was gonna just do a bunch of messed up mods and shit, but I decided not to do it.
[147:38.28]Back to the germpocalypse.
[147:39.38]Yeah, that's where we're going.
[147:46.48]Welcome to Nevada.
[148:03.24]Silly mod.
[148:04.72]What does that even do?
[148:07.45]That's silly mode.
[148:08.23]What does it do?
[148:10.15]Are you trying to tell me these are the same guys that I crippled from before?
[148:12.93]They're just barely getting down here?
[148:15.67]I don't believe that.
[148:21.45]These guys are just getting down here.
[148:25.28]That scared the fuck out of me.
[148:27.66]I thought I could pick the cone up.
[148:37.18]They hardly even know how to fight.
[148:40.84]What is going on with these guys?
[148:42.02]What are you guys doing?
[148:42.96]What the fuck are you doing?
[148:45.22]What are you doing?
[148:46.15]I don't... Who is doing this?
[148:55.33]And why?
[148:55.95]What?
[149:05.73]What the fuck just- what was that?
[149:07.27]Are you kid- are you absolutely serious right now?
[149:20.08]First you have like the Benny Hill music that should have been playing.
[149:23.24]Guys sprinting around with their legs up their ass.
[149:27.73]And then somebody somewhere was shooting me with a machine gun and then I exploded.
[149:30.77]Oh boy, that was- that was great.
[149:41.70]delete your VOD and pretend this never happened.
[149:44.70]No, never.
[149:46.16]I would never do something like that.
[149:47.80]Ever.
[149:50.62]So this time, I will be aware of that.
[149:57.91]Welcome to hell.
[150:06.43]So where is the person that I shoot?
[150:08.28]Are they up on the hill up here or something?
[150:11.96]That whole thing just didn't make any sense.
[150:17.22]It still doesn't.
[150:27.51]It's gonna happen again, isn't it?
[150:35.07]Oh, f- Oh, God.
[150:47.08]And this guy made it up.
[150:48.78]This guy made it up.
[150:54.37]You deserve to live, man.
[150:56.17]You earned it.
[151:00.93]Okay.
[151:03.76]Sounds like a plan.
[151:21.26]What?
[151:26.08]No, I don't want to shoot this guy.
[151:33.43]This is so confusing to me.
[151:38.34]What was the point of your coming over here?
[151:42.26]I don't know.
[151:42.78]Ooh, machete.
[151:45.80]Let me try that out.
[151:54.52]Machete, huh?
[151:55.20]Combat knife is... 13.
[152:00.66]28.
[152:01.86]But... No, it's 12.
[152:05.36]Combat knife is still the best, isn't it?
[152:08.30]Bonus limb damage or bonus critical damage.
[152:15.34]Whatever.
[152:16.40]Let's go.
[152:27.54]I gotta hide for a second.
[152:37.18]In the head.
[152:37.58]In the head.
[152:37.98]In the head.
[152:38.48]Thank you.
[152:42.55]People with the long-range weapons are gonna kill me.
[152:44.65]Right in the chest.
[152:53.65]Can never go wrong right in the stomach.
[152:57.60]Is that luck playing out?
[153:00.72]Crit damage is helpful and your 10 luck is almost a crit.
[153:03.24]Always, yeah.
[153:04.08]That's good.
[153:10.79]I don't think I'm going to be able to carry this.
[153:12.03]I can try, though.
[153:19.34]I guess I can.
[153:36.41]Quick save.
[153:38.27]Heal a little bit too.
[153:41.41]Some fucking corn and shit.
[153:45.70]Are there actually like other slot machines in the game?
[153:47.72]That'd be kind of cool.
[153:50.88]Alright.
[153:57.90]Where am I going?
[154:00.22]What time is it right now too?
[154:01.20]I might stop streaming here in a little bit.
[154:04.49]Once I get to Novac.
[154:06.07]And I just complete whatever I'm doing.
[154:07.89]I might end the stream.
[154:12.13]This has been fun though.
[154:12.71]It's been funny.
[154:13.47]It's been entertaining.
[154:15.07]I probably will stream this again.
[154:24.21]I'm just getting tired.
[154:26.70]And I need to finish a video.
[154:29.28]So it can be uploaded tomorrow to my YouTube channel.
[154:34.00]You know.
[154:42.35]There's a strip club?
[154:43.31]Aw, dude, strip club!
[154:46.37]Is my plus 10 luck working the strip club?
[154:50.95]Do I get extra stripping?
[155:04.66]I need to sell stuff.
[155:06.38]So badly.
[155:14.28]wait what wait what rock boo 1615 thanks for three months man welcome back powder gang guard oh I'm that's the faction you're now dressed as a member of the ncr

[155:59.14]Drink flamer fuel.
[156:00.66]Drinking glass.
[156:03.28]These empty bottles.
[156:04.10]I don't want any of these.
[156:04.82]Who cares?
[156:13.78]A toaster.
[156:14.34]When did I pick up a toaster?
[156:16.83]Why do I still have a vacuum cleaner?
[156:18.64]Why do I have these things?
[156:21.56]Wait a minute.
[156:21.98]Where's that Wonder Glue?
[156:26.26]Okay.
[156:33.02]Take it easy, Calum.
[156:33.84]Thanks for coming out, man.
[156:37.28]Well, let's get to Novak.
[156:40.94]And I'm going to call it for today.
[156:46.89]If I get there.
[156:47.45]Let's hope I make it alive.
[156:59.36]What is that?
[157:04.56]Whoa.
[157:08.16]Hey, guys.
[157:08.98]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[157:09.94]I want to sell you things.
[157:10.58]Yes, I do.
[157:18.49]He has a lot of caps on him.
[157:23.49]Nice.
[157:23.75]That's a lot of money.
[157:30.69]Take this cleaner too.
[157:31.61]I don't want it.
[157:31.99]Take the ball cap.
[157:34.83]Have this baseball.
[157:35.71]Why do I have this?
[157:38.25]Take the cigarettes.
[157:41.47]Chess board.
[157:43.97]Three coffee mugs.
[157:48.82]Egg timer.
[157:52.57]Can have this too.
[157:57.11]I guess I could read this, right?
[157:58.71]I don't want to go over because he only has 587.
[158:19.59]Take a missile, too.
[158:23.05]And a paint gun.
[158:25.17]And some pre-war money.
[158:26.05]Okay.
[158:28.69]I'm taking all of his cash.
[158:30.84]And what do you actually have?
[158:32.12]Do you have any stim packs?
[158:35.70]One stim pack.
[158:39.00]You are useless.
[158:44.37]Okay.
[158:44.75]I dumped off some of the things I didn't want.
[158:58.01]are they doing?
[159:01.03]No, there are no mods.
[159:02.40]I'm just playing Fallout New Vegas the way it was intended to play like four years ago.
[159:17.77]You shut up.
[159:19.77]That sounds like a gun.
[159:20.53]Somebody's shooting a machine gun over there.
[159:30.68]What's the plan for this playthrough, if you don't mind me asking?
[159:32.50]Blind?
[159:33.04]It's pretty much just blind.
[159:41.77]Honest to God, somebody's dead!
[159:43.49]There's a dead person on the road!
[159:47.01]Huh?
[159:56.59]How did this guy die?
[160:08.34]I don't know.
[160:12.99]Berkish man.
[160:15.13]The two months.
[160:16.51]Thank you.
[160:17.03]Welcome back.
[160:23.55]Almost there.
[160:24.41]Halfway.
[160:27.75]I didn't kill that guy.
[160:28.60]That was the crippled kind of guy walking around, wasn't it?
[160:42.64]Maybe he just died.
[160:44.18]Couldn't take it anymore.
[160:50.31]Take it easy, Bernhard.
[160:53.19]Thanks for coming out.
[161:03.01]You can't run at a guy with a gun.
[161:06.54]It's the dumbest thing you could do.
[161:08.08]More of you just sprinting at a guy with a gun with nothing.
[161:14.27]Just have a death wish.
[161:15.53]This guy at least, or this lady, at least decided to bring a weapon.
[161:21.62]You're not the dumbest person out of the three.
[161:33.45]But you are still pretty dumb.
[161:37.26]Dr. Plato.
[161:38.36]Welcome, Dr. Plato.
[161:39.62]Plato.
[161:39.90]Thanks for the sub.
[161:40.81]Much appreciated.
[161:41.59]It's very heavy.
[162:08.47]Just throw the damn thing on the ground.
[162:09.62]I don't want it.
[162:11.74]I do not want it.
[162:15.08]What's going on?
[162:23.83]Why am I getting coordinates?
[162:27.95]Okay, that was... I hit the console.
[162:30.73]Okay.
[162:33.14]How did I do that?
[162:45.89]Hit tilde, Jerry.
[162:50.41]I did.
[163:03.01]More shooting.
[163:03.55]From a direction I don't know where.
[163:07.11]I think it was that guy.
[163:17.51]Cheating in console.
[163:18.31]I'm not cheating in console.
[163:19.55]I just opened.
[163:20.37]I was trying to press tab and I pressed tilde.
[163:25.80]Tilde.
[163:29.42]It's the tilde key.
[163:30.36]I think it's called tilde.
[163:32.88]It's tilde.
[163:38.74]It's funny that it reminds you that.
[163:41.25]Just in case you forgot, you're dressed like one of these guys.
[163:49.46]That's a pretty cool T-Rex statue.
[164:00.61]Alright.
[164:01.07]Once I get here, I'm going to end the stream.
[164:07.49]That's right.

[164:41.38]And I'm gonna hide in the diner.
[164:45.44]This is my final... Final showdown.
[164:54.35]No, they don't care.
[164:55.09]Alright, well, that's it.
[164:55.63]How about instead of ending the stream, you just stream forever?
[165:08.35]If Renee wants me to keep streaming, then I'm going to have to keep streaming, alright?
[165:14.21]Alright, Renee.
[165:15.37]Here you go.
[165:18.33]This one's for you.

[167:53.44]Much appreciated.
[168:03.40]If you shoot somebody in the head that many times, I'm pretty sure they're not going to just stare at you.
[168:10.27]They're going to die.
[168:11.21]Okay, head through Novak.
[168:16.03]I'll go for a little bit longer.

[168:57.26]Yeah, there was some random fucking guy just standing there.
[169:00.54]He didn't move for ten straight hours.
[169:03.74]What the fuck was wrong with that guy?
[169:06.31]Don't let him in our town.
[169:10.79]If your perception is one, you basically threw the bullets at them with your hands.
[169:13.47]Okay, I'm going to start to pay attention now.
[169:17.64]Let's go.
[169:18.16]I got to... Quests.

[169:28.68]I don't mean any harm.
[169:31.60]Hmm.
[169:38.59]Don't think that's not going to happen.
[169:40.33]We can talk.
[169:41.01]Just tell me.
[169:41.69]Talk to me, please.
[169:43.11]This guy is fucking useless.
[169:43.93]Um... Uh... I'm looking for a man in a checkered coat.
[170:05.81]Is this guy tiny?
[170:07.70]Or what?
[170:08.08]I feel like this guy's like five feet tall, isn't he?
[170:10.34]Alright, gotta go to the dinosaur.
[170:11.48]Bye.
[170:31.45]Find out from Manny Vargas where the Khans were headed.
[170:35.91]Where's Manny?

[171:02.88]What's wrong with being five feet tall?
[171:04.40]Nothing.
[171:04.66]It was just surprising to me.
[171:17.09]Ernest.
[171:17.61]Good old Ernest.
[171:19.61]He used to go places.
[171:23.97]Dinobite gift shop.
[171:26.35]Hey, there's the dinosaur.
[171:35.25]Don't ever tell me I can't get over a fucking fence.
[171:37.19]I'm the fence master.

[172:19.75]Oh, my God.
[172:20.27]I want that so bad.
[172:21.07]I just completely forgot he was looking at me.
[172:24.11]I just so badly wanted the dinosaur.
[172:25.73]I had to just take it, and apparently we're okay.
[172:28.57]What an impulsive psycho.
[172:29.73]I just was like, give me that.
[172:33.02]Welcome to the Dino Byte gift shop.

[173:16.31]Is that any good?
[173:17.89]I can afford it.

[173:46.57]Is the power fist good?
[173:49.55]Fist us, Jerma.
[173:56.92]I don't think I... I think I'll take a pass on that for now.

[180:21.12]Look at these toys.
[180:21.77]Look at all these fucking toys over here too.
[180:28.39]Getting so many toys.
[180:34.69]Wait a second.
[180:36.49]These are not toys at all.
[180:37.34]I think these are just coffee cups.
[180:41.58]Like shoes.
[180:45.62]Forest impacts.
[180:51.73]I'm pretty much a gerbil right now.
[180:55.97]Mateo Potato 2.
[180:57.10]Welcome back for two months, man.
[181:01.32]Have a gerbil.
[181:02.56]You know when you give a gerbil a nut and it just stuffs it in his mouth?
[181:07.56]Oh, God.
[181:10.28]Okay, don't go in that room.
[181:12.05]You're not going to like what you see.
[181:13.01]I have to talk to this guy.
[181:16.55]I'm looking for a man in a coat.
[181:17.99]Sure, I know him.
[181:18.69]What do you want with him?
[181:20.41]I've got a score to settle.
[181:21.17]Do you want to buy some stuff?
[181:22.05]Of course.
[181:22.27]I have to help you do something stupid.
[181:23.51]Can I interest you in a dinosaur?
[181:47.75]Drop everything here and drown this guy in toys.
[181:50.25]Yep.
[181:52.67]Absolutely.
[181:54.17]Are you shitting me?
[181:55.11]Absolutely.
[181:55.55]That's what we're going to do.
[181:57.81]We're going to fill the dinosaur's mouth with toys.
[182:00.47]And just try to kill this guy with quicksand and toys.
[182:07.76]What?
[182:09.48]I can't remove these from my inventory?
[182:13.80]I have 160 of them.
[182:14.36]Okay.
[182:14.52]Drop 280 of them.
[182:19.42]That's not 280.
[182:19.84]Found you!
[182:40.83]Had enough?
[182:53.11]Terrible plan.
[182:55.43]No, hold on.
[182:56.69]I can't get embarrassed like that.
[183:00.57]You know what I'm gonna do.
[183:01.25]I'm gonna beat the fucking bag out of this guy.
[183:08.73]Come on!
[183:13.91]Now I gotta loot him.
[183:15.61]I gotta get his stuff.
[183:19.71]Currently stuck in the mouth.
[183:26.94]Whoa.
[183:28.70]Oh, you just got disarmed.
[183:30.09]He picked it back up again.
[183:36.11]Who else?
[183:36.95]Who else wants some, huh?
[183:37.73]What do you want?
[183:40.35]Come get these fucking toys.
[183:41.83]You think you can take them from me?
[183:43.25]You're going to pry over my cold, dead fucking body.
[183:50.06]I want to get out of here.
[183:50.84]I don't want to go back down.
[183:58.78]I love that you can do the uppercut.
[183:59.72]That's so awesome.
[184:02.04]Hold on.
[184:02.58]I'm going to rocket jump.
[184:04.06]You guys ready to see somebody rocket jump in Fallout?
[184:18.88]Did I kill that guy?
[184:20.52]Wasn't he already dead?
[184:22.60]Please.
[184:23.50]Please let me rocket jump.
[184:24.62]I just want to rocket jump out of here.
[184:37.03]Come on!
[184:38.89]There we go.
[184:39.61]That's what I wanted.
[184:47.16]Alright.
[184:48.44]Here we go.
[184:53.10]Is there a way I can just drop these one at a time?
[184:54.63]Am I gonna have to do this 200 times?
[185:07.88]I'm not going to do this.
[185:08.70]This is not working.
[185:11.78]Although, I kind of have to, right?
[185:19.66]See you in three hours.
[185:20.42]Give me these back.
[185:23.80]No reason to do this.
[185:24.44]It's not going to be funny.
[185:26.43]Nothing funny about that at all.
[185:28.03]I've come to the conclusion.
[185:29.31]Nothing funny.
[185:30.81]At all.
[185:31.63]About what that was going on.
[185:33.21]What's going on, man?
[185:35.03]I'm looking for a man in a coat.
[185:37.25]Sure.
[185:38.77]I'll deal with the person.
[185:40.07]I would, but I've got to watch the road.
[185:42.21]Caesar's Legion has been taking territory just east of here.
[185:44.95]Yeah.
[185:45.25]They took Nelson.
[185:46.97]If we let our guard down... Okay, I got it.
[185:51.53]Take care of it.
[186:01.61]No, this is not funny!
[186:02.77]What am I doing?
[186:03.29]Get out of here!
[186:03.81]This is not funny!
[186:05.59]I keep trying to do it.
[186:07.61]Hoping that I'm gonna laugh at it.
[186:09.62]That's just not funny at all.
[186:11.36]It's kind of funny.
[186:21.87]Instant.
[186:26.91]This stream fucking sucks because you didn't do that.
[186:31.84]Just press R?
[186:32.68]Is that what it is?
[186:37.83]It's not doing it.
[186:40.49]It's not doing it.
[186:42.95]R doesn't do it.
[186:43.47]It's not working.
[186:46.71]I'm going to do it real fast so you can see.
[186:53.15]X. No.
[186:57.15]Nope.
[186:59.06]Nope.
[186:59.60]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[187:11.48]Still overburdened.
[187:14.54]Shit.
[187:17.14]Ten millimeter pistol.
[187:18.08]Two of them.
[187:18.62]Just repair one of them.
[187:20.38]Whatever.
[187:20.66]I don't care.
[187:21.14]Which one?
[187:21.66]That one.
[187:26.11]Where does it say my actual stats?
[187:32.93]80, 80 XP.
[187:35.21]Where's your actual weight?
[187:37.93]Where does it show my weight?
[187:43.09]302.
[187:43.11]Okay.
[187:43.87]I need to drop... I can't... That was 300.
[187:47.19]300.
[187:47.21]300.
[187:47.25]Alright, what's the dinosaur command?
[187:57.65]Somebody look it up.
[188:13.27]I'm carrying.
[188:14.07]I have to throw them down.
[188:15.45]Too many of them.
[188:19.37]It's still overburdened.
[188:27.23]Dino command?
[188:28.11]I'm on it.
[188:32.07]Rats instagib.
[188:35.27]Probably.
[188:35.61]It was a fun game.
[188:36.71]I don't see why they wouldn't.
[188:41.47]Alright, the joke has run its course.
[188:43.24]I have to throw them in the trash.
[188:45.60]They're way too much.
[188:49.42]Oh, never mind.
[188:49.88]Hold on.
[188:51.78]I forgot I did that.
[188:53.97]I have like a hundred bucks.
[188:57.65]Little lunch boxes and shit.
[189:00.63]What a moron.
[189:14.30]Okay, now, if I get rid of... I don't care about two iron.
[189:22.42]Get rid of the flower.
[189:23.18]I don't want a fire hose.
[189:25.18]Who cares?
[189:27.18]Almost there.
[189:28.05]Almost there.
[189:28.65]Alright, we can go.
[189:37.29]I'm going to trash the place.
[189:41.81]So, where do I actually need to go?
[189:55.97]Wait, did he not tell me where to go?
[190:01.38]Incoming attack?
[190:02.44]Why would I get attacked?
[190:08.98]Oh, he wants me to kill the ghouls.
[190:11.80]Okay, yeah, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.
[190:13.30]I gotcha.
[190:14.54]I'll go kill the ghouls.
[190:15.60]You stay put.
[190:16.22]Okay, hold on.
[190:19.89]Player, place at me.
[190:23.55]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[190:24.07]We're gonna go try it.
[190:31.27]I'm going to do it.
[190:31.79]Alright.
[190:32.57]I'll cover him.
[190:33.95]So it's console.spin to player.place at me.
[190:35.34]8E664.
[190:37.36]I don't think I can do 10,000.
[190:42.20]I'll do 1,000.
[190:43.70]Uh-oh.
[190:59.90]Oh, God.
[191:01.42]That was a bad idea.
[191:02.88]That was a bad idea.
[191:03.66]It's like popcorn.
[191:05.16]It's popping popcorn.
[191:08.52]Oh, goodness.
[191:10.88]Hooray.
[191:15.86]Okay, I think I can handle another one.
[191:19.76]I don't know if it should be 1,000.
[191:21.06]It'll be 500.
[191:21.38]Oh!
[191:21.44]Oh!
[191:27.67]Ooh, he's gonna get pushed out.
[191:31.88]He's gonna get pushed out.
[191:32.84]Look at him, he's looking at me like, dude, what the fuck are you doing, man?
[191:42.49]I don't know if I can handle anymore.
[191:45.43]We can do another 500.
[191:48.73]Game's crashing.
[191:51.26]Game's crashing.
[191:57.16]Hey, this is Marty.
[192:07.52]Thanks a lot, man.
[192:08.18]Welcome.
[192:10.10]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[192:12.54]What else can I spot up here?
[192:15.30]We're gonna go with the big fucking, the big, the big number.
[192:17.66]We're going for 5,000.
[192:18.28]See you later, guys.
[192:20.72]Stream is over.
[192:21.48]This is gonna end the stream.
[192:26.75]My video card's crashing.
[192:29.27]Yep, bye.
[192:37.12]Maybe if I don't move?
[192:42.26]Yeah, nobody move.
[192:43.46]It might work itself out.
[192:55.99]It might be alright.
[193:04.78]Oh, what?
[193:05.10]You can't even load 5,000 dinosaurs?
[193:07.14]Game sucks.
[193:11.16]I smell smoke.
[193:14.19]Holy shit.
[193:15.01]No, I'm kidding.
[193:19.05]If they can't see us, we don't move.
[193:20.95]Come on!
[193:21.31]What the fuck?
[193:36.28]Hold on.
[193:36.86]I'm going to fix this.
[193:38.20]I'm not going out like this.
[193:45.04]Hold on a second.
[193:47.30]I feel like I killed the process.
[193:54.43]No, it's starting soon.
[193:58.09]God damn it.
[193:59.27]I think my whole computer is locked up.
[194:00.57]I think I'm stuck in the stream forever until I hold the power button down on my computer.
[194:10.29]Am I still here?
[194:14.13]I'm in my task manager right now.
[194:19.79]Hold on.
[194:20.33]I can kill it.
[194:21.48]Kill the process.
[194:24.24]Okay.
[194:25.14]We're fine.
[194:29.00]We're fine.
[194:38.05]Going back in.
[194:45.08]We're good to go.
[194:45.52]I'm going to be right in that same spot.
[194:54.41]We're not going to do any more fucking around.
[194:57.29]Why would we do any more fucking around?
[194:58.89]Continue from my last saved game.
[195:04.42]Don't worry, everybody.
[195:06.62]God, we're back.
[195:10.08]Just like that, we're back.
[195:18.65]Alright, so what was that command again?
[195:23.99]I think it's still dead down here.
[195:34.48]Yeah, we just started.
[195:35.18]Hey, starting soon.
[195:42.44]I am the raddest girl, little honey.
[195:45.34]I will kill you just for... Just for help!
[195:54.38]Whoa!
[195:54.76]Aerolist00000.
[195:55.10]Aerolist000, thank you for subscribing.
[195:56.54]Welcome.
[195:57.92]Welcome.
[195:58.32]Alright, what's the thing?
[195:59.18]How do you spawn, like, just deathclaws?
[196:02.30]And then give me a rocket launcher.
[196:06.71]Can't even load 100,000 dinos.
[196:07.47]We're streamer 2881.
[196:08.09]It's not 2081.
[196:16.11]Somebody get me the command.
[196:16.97]I want to spawn like 60 deathclaws.
[196:20.54]Just see what happens and then we're done.
[196:24.62]You better prepare yourself, man.
[196:26.68]Get that gun ready.
[196:27.54]Because you're going to need to fucking use it real soon.
[196:36.01]You know what?
[196:36.69]Hold on.
[196:39.02]Place that be eight, six, five, two, three, four of a hundred of them.
[196:49.79]I'll get one.
[196:50.17]Okay, one, six, seven.
[197:18.07]Polinominal?
[197:20.67]Welcome, dude.
[197:21.23]Thank you so much.
[197:23.01]Welcome to the good-natured man corrupted by godlike power.
[197:29.25]I'm just gonna... I see one in the chat.
[197:30.42]I'm just gonna throw it down.
[197:33.42]Whatever it had some being.
[197:35.40]Oh, Ronnie put it up there.
[197:36.26]I'm not sure where it was.
[197:39.28]I'm gonna find Ronnie.
[197:40.02]Ronnie, put it back in the chat, because I can't alt-tab, or else I'll die.
[197:44.74]EF100.
[197:45.54]Holy shit.
[197:50.95]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[197:51.81]Before I do anything, how do I get myself, like, superpowers?
[197:57.19]I'm currently inside of one right now, and there's gonna be a hundred of them.
[198:11.41]Nobody can be good natured with a power fist.
[198:14.83]TGM?
[198:15.77]Alright.
[198:17.41]Give me one more.
[198:17.93]We're going to have a war here.
[198:18.73]We're going to have a battle.
[198:23.61]You know what?
[198:24.19]Fuck it.
[198:26.81]Alright.
[198:27.01]God mode.
[198:28.67]Good luck, town.
[198:29.67]Oh, fuck.
[198:30.19]I'm crashed.
[198:34.21]Get me out.
[198:35.69]I'm inside of them.
[198:38.47]Wait.
[198:42.37]I've just been swallowed.
[198:43.69]Oh, I'm almost out.
[198:46.25]I can see glimpses.
[198:47.70]I can see glimpses.
[198:57.64]Oh, god.
[198:58.70]Oh, god.
[199:07.56]Where?
[199:08.00]Help.
[199:08.23]TCL?
[199:08.69]TCL.
[199:10.29]Collision off.
[199:14.43]Oh, God.
[199:16.13]Whoa.
[199:17.55]Where am I going?
[199:19.12]What's happening?
[199:20.82]What's going on?
[199:53.44]What's going on?
[199:56.32]Why are my fingers so long?
[200:01.85]Who told me to do this?
[200:07.44]Can I get back?
[200:09.26]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[200:13.21]Wait a second.
[200:14.45]Wait a second.
[200:15.11]I need to get my bearings here for a second.
[200:17.13]I want to throw shit down.
[200:18.07]I want to rain hell.
[200:20.07]Here we go.
[200:20.43]I'm spawning.
[200:21.63]What's the dinosaur command again?
[200:22.54]What?
[200:33.80]They're just a ball of shit.
[200:36.46]Shit.
[200:37.68]No, I ruined it.
[200:39.46]I think I ruined it.
[200:49.51]I wanted just to drop them like a fucking helicopter.
[200:51.85]Here's the breathing.
[201:01.31]Oh.
[201:06.58]Damn.
[201:09.73]Oh god.
[201:11.91]Okay, okay guys.
[201:24.63]It's the breathing that's still making me laugh.
[201:33.05]Okay.
[201:36.81]I think I'm done.
[201:43.19]Alright, guys.
[201:45.89]I'm so glad I could... Yeah, that's true, Renee.
[201:49.27]We wouldn't have seen this monstrosity.
[201:54.47]Thank you all for watching.
[201:56.31]I'll probably stream it again tomorrow or the next day or something.
[201:59.15]After I get done with my...
[202:03.05]Okay, I have to shut this up.
[202:04.59]I can't even do like an outro.
[202:06.91]Shut up, game.
[202:11.41]What music is playing?
[202:15.66]You hear this?
[202:28.54]Thank you, Warvoid.
[202:30.04]Welcome.
[202:31.17]You subbed right at the end of the stream.
[202:34.26]I will catch you guys later.
[202:36.42]Thank you so much for coming out.
[202:37.92]Thank you so much to all the new subscribers, all the old subscribers, and all the people watching.
[202:43.09]Much love.
[202:44.37]I'll see you guys soon.
[202:45.81]Take care, guys, and good night.
