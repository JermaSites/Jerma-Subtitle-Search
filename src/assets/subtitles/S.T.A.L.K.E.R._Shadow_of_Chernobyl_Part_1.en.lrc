[04:21.53]He's the one that founded McDonald's.
[04:23.17]That's why I don't like him.
[04:25.07]He made fucking the first McDonald's restaurant.
[04:27.19]He snuck in.
[04:27.87]He did his fucking Reagan Freakonomics and then he took over McDonald's.
[04:31.41]They made a movie about it.
[04:32.31]It's called The Founder.
[04:34.30]Michael Keaton plays Ronald Reagan.

[05:15.61]It's not a joke.
[05:17.05]I can't just fuck around and like throw grenades at people.
[05:19.38]Like, this game, I have to take this game dead seriously.
[05:22.58]So this is going to be a dead serious stream.
[05:25.94]And I know, I know, I know I say that sometimes.
[05:28.34]Like, oh, Jerma says that and then he like throws a grenade at somebody.
[05:31.30]I'm not going to throw a grenade at a shopkeeper.
[05:33.19]Okay?
[05:33.45]It's not going to happen.
[05:35.83]So, with that being said, those of you guys, I should pick Master.
[05:41.23]Why should I pick Master?
[05:47.21]Give me one reason why that's a good idea.
[05:51.09]Novice makes it harder.
[05:55.23]How does that make any sense?
[06:00.98]I should do master difficulty?
[06:07.42]Master makes guns more powerful.
[06:09.06]Master, like, affects damage and stuff.
[06:16.08]Okay, Sam, I see what you said.

[09:47.86]Besides, keeping you busy might be a good way to deal with your amnesia.
[09:53.51]And I'll see what I can find out about your problem.
[09:56.84]I don't give a shit why you want to find this Trella guy.
[10:00.94]Alright.
[10:01.30]Wait, wait.
[10:01.66]Am I the guy that just woke up?
[10:02.76]To kill him?
[10:03.94]Well, you must have your... What are you standing there for?
[10:07.57]Wait a minute.
[10:08.79]Am I the guy that woke up?
[10:09.91]Don't bite.
[10:12.71]Okay.
[10:13.27]The choice is yours.
[10:14.99]Either I brainwash you... I did that.
[10:16.35]I'm the guy that woke up.
[10:17.03]...as we do with all the rookies, or I treat you like a real stalker and take you to a mission straight away.
[10:23.21]Experienced, traitor, attitude neutral.
[10:25.79]I'm a loner.
[10:26.83]I'm a rookie.
[10:28.65]Okay.
[10:30.57]Treat me like a rookie.
[10:31.41]I don't remember shit.
[10:32.47]Tell me, please.
[10:49.52]Your tasks can be found in the first section of the... Most tasks have... He didn't tell me.
[10:55.04]...to access additional information on the task.
[10:58.11]Okay.
[10:58.59]Remember, each new task is automatically shown on your mini-map.
[11:04.30]Alright.
[11:05.59]He cut himself off.
[11:06.53]Moving on.
[11:07.59]The second section on the PDA is the map.
[11:10.55]Buttons above the map allow you to zoom in and out.
[11:13.98]Alright.
[11:14.92]It's too quiet?
[11:15.62]I'll turn it up.
[11:17.58]Oh, you can also center the map on yourself and...
[11:22.08]There are no subtitles in the game?
[11:23.40]Oh, by the way, you can call one of these two same guys.
[11:25.60]Dania and Philia.
[11:26.80]It's a separate work cell phone.
[11:28.06]What the fuck?
[11:28.88]Okay, that's kind of cool.
[11:53.52]It's a ranking system?
[11:54.62]Yellow.
[11:55.56]Alright, there's a lot to take in.
[11:56.84]I gotta read somebody's diary now?
[11:58.36]Alright.
[12:16.50]Well, what is there to say about it?
[12:19.49]All the information you need is noted in your journal.
[12:23.11]And news, too.
[12:24.21]Not going to last more than an hour in this game?
[12:26.16]You think so?
[12:28.36]Then there's a ratings section.
[12:32.15]Alright.
[12:32.53]What?
[12:32.79]This is so weird.
[12:33.81]Do we have to kill each other?
[12:34.93]You guys don't have any faith in me at all.
[12:51.60]Like, I'm gonna blow through this fucking game and beat the whole thing.
[12:54.79]I don't fuck around when it comes to hard games.
[12:56.93]Alright, encyclopedia, we got it.
[12:57.69]I get it.
[12:58.01]So, let's do it.
[13:08.74]I want you to find a stalker called Nimble.
[13:11.40]He was carrying some very important information.
[13:14.50]He disappeared somewhere near the bridge.
[13:17.46]Dead or alive.
[13:18.22]Dead or alive, I don't care.
[13:19.76]Need that flash drive.
[13:23.10]Visit Wolf.

[13:25.16]Okay.
[13:27.79]It's off now.
[13:28.39]Bring me the flash drive and we'll consider the fact that you're partially paid me for serving you.
[13:31.77]Okay.
[13:32.07]New tech.
[13:32.37]Get information from the scout.
[13:33.83]I'll go for it.
[13:37.33]Let's do this first.
[13:40.58]Let's go to sound.
[13:41.62]Let's bring the sound up a little bit for you guys.
[13:44.85]Actually, I could probably do that easily here.
[13:47.55]Save the game so we don't have to do this again.
[13:48.99]We're going to save called.
[13:51.85]Gotcha.
[13:52.61]Save it.
[13:54.63]Let me just do this real quick.
[13:57.64]One second.
[13:59.26]One second of your time.
[14:00.40]I'm going to turn it up.
[14:02.84]So you guys say it needs to be louder?
[14:04.26]There it is.
[14:09.41]It's a little bit louder now.
[14:11.65]A little bit louder now.
[14:14.31]That's good.
[14:15.42]That's good.
[14:15.90]Quick save will set that.
[14:17.78]So controls.
[14:19.18]Quick save.
[14:20.44]We're going to put that somewhere very easy to do.

[14:25.56]Save game.
[14:27.78]It's F6.

[14:32.89]T. T. Okay.
[14:38.09]Return to game.
[14:41.18]So, we just- I gotta open the door.
[14:42.92]Alright.
[14:46.95]Good hunting, stalker.
[14:48.53]Is there a reason why my guy is like waddling around like a fucking penguin?
[14:53.87]The jumps will help you climb on top of median barriers.
[14:56.87]To jump, press space.
[15:02.62]Game saved.
[15:03.38]Jere- Jeremy Quicksave.
[15:06.34]Why does it know my name?
[15:09.12]What?
[15:12.23]Why does it know my fucking name?
[15:13.83]Alright, anyways.
[15:18.30]What did it say?
[15:18.84]X?
[15:19.32]I just missed that.
[15:20.08]What the fuck did it just try to tell me?
[15:25.62]Is this a bad guy?
[15:29.98]Select 5 and then press fire to zoom.
[15:37.50]Alright, is this guy friendly?
[15:46.65]Okay, I think these guys are friendly.
[15:49.23]By helping other characters, you improve their attitude towards you, as well as your general reputat- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:53.37]Trying to give you additional information, sell you their items for cheaper.
[15:58.75]Okay, well, there's like a reputation system in this game.
[16:02.43]And is there no way I can turn off this fucking head-Bob?
[16:05.14]I have a guitar.
[16:10.76]Do I have a gun?
[16:16.61]That's cool.
[16:17.15]There he is.
[16:20.74]You can?
[16:21.58]You can turn it off, yes.
[16:22.38]How do you do it?
[16:25.08]Cam inert zero.
[16:27.68]Cam underscore inert zero.
[16:29.36]Okay.
[16:29.50]What is that?
[16:30.82]Like here, right?
[16:33.86]Cam inert zero.
[16:38.82]Like that?
[16:43.77]Like this?
[16:46.89]Let me make sure I'm doing this right.
[16:51.41]Time to cheat.
[16:53.75]But it's in the options.
[16:54.75]I thought I had to do it in here.
[16:55.99]There we go.
[17:03.53]Beautiful.
[17:04.45]Thank God.
[17:05.29]That was fucking unbearable.
[17:06.81]Okay, let's go.
[17:10.26]Hey, why are you here?
[17:12.12]I need to see Nimble.
[17:12.88]I would like to know where I can find him.
[17:15.18]Not what I would call friendly.
[17:16.22]Or is that you're just too wee?
[17:37.08]Just too weak to do it.
[17:38.64]I'd bop you one, but what's the use?
[17:40.08]It's not that simple.
[17:41.08]I've got too few people, and even those I got are mostly rookies.
[17:44.46]I can't take that risk.
[17:45.88]If we lose this camp, think this guy's Russian.
[17:48.75]Things will get worse for all the stalkers out there.
[17:51.47]And what about yourself?
[17:53.03]You aren't too scared?
[17:53.93]I want that my pride make you say to everything, huh?
[17:57.33]So, will you help me deal with these thugs?
[18:03.21]Think I could do it alone?
[18:05.39]No.
[18:06.05]You stand no chance on your own.
[18:08.29]My scouts are good soldiers and right now they're right behind these freaks.
[18:11.81]Together you can make a run for it.
[18:14.34]What do you think?
[18:15.06]You got the goods?
[18:16.88]I got the goods.
[18:20.00]Meet with Wolf's people.
[18:21.22]Guys, I'm sending someone your way, so wing it.
[18:23.86]You may attack if necessary.
[18:25.36]Over.
[18:25.92]Alright, Wolf.
[18:26.52]Send him.
[18:28.22]As long as he stays out of the way.
[18:33.79]Out.
[18:33.91]Okay.
[18:34.11]So where is that again?
[18:34.97]I gotta look at the map.
[18:38.49]Meet with Wolf's people.
[18:39.43]Alright, map.
[18:41.01]Is this Wolf's people?
[18:44.45]No.
[18:45.22]This is Wolf's scouts.
[18:46.22]Straight ahead.
[18:46.82]Okay.
[18:48.36]So I just gotta go this way.
[18:52.40]Save it.
[18:52.84]Save it, Jeremy.
[18:53.56]Quick save.
[18:56.48]Is there a sprint?
[18:59.13]Where do I get a weapon?
[18:59.87]I'm just walking around with fucking binoculars.
[19:03.57]Can I get something?
[19:05.89]I'm so useless right now.
[19:07.01]What am I gonna do?
[19:07.89]Walk up and fucking stare at people real close?
[19:15.77]Wait a minute.
[19:17.17]Taurus, yeah, I'm just like, hmm, what's over there?
[19:19.23]A person.
[19:23.99]Oh, shit, nice.
[19:24.81]Okay, X is sprint.
[19:29.52]Okay.
[19:32.12]Easy enough.
[19:32.62]Alright, so now we just gotta go this way.
[19:37.12]I gotta go, like, meet the fucking guys, bandits.
[19:40.54]Let's just go check it out.
[19:42.63]I use my inventory.
[19:43.79]I have this gun.
[19:46.95]So how do I put the gun on?
[19:50.37]Okay, it was already on.
[19:55.71]Alright.
[19:56.92]Huh?
[19:57.88]Whoa, whoa, okay.
[19:58.62]Okay.
[20:00.49]Let's just go.
[20:04.01]This looks like DayZ.
[20:05.51]We gotta find the scout.
[20:11.39]Huh?
[20:12.13]What is going on here?
[20:13.38]What is this?
[20:14.32]What's happening?
[20:16.02]What was all the beeps?
[20:17.02]There was like a bunch of beeps right there.
[20:19.34]Was I not supposed to do that?
[20:25.72]Was I about to get like a nuke dropped on me?
[20:27.42]Alright, here's the guy I gotta meet.
[20:29.92]Pipe down, man.
[20:31.12]Let me feel you in.
[20:32.64]Let me feel you.
[20:34.60]Some stalkers won't want to talk to you if you stick your weapon in their face.
[20:37.16]To hide your weapon, you only need to select a bolt.
[20:43.66]What the fuck is this?
[20:45.78]What did I just do?
[20:46.78]What is this?
[20:49.04]Am I holding on?
[20:50.74]I have bullets in my hand?
[20:57.04]Okay.
[20:58.14]Is it like a rock?
[21:01.52]Hello, Wolf has already sent word of you.
[21:02.96]You got any questions?

[33:36.87]Is that the health pack?
[33:37.43]Can I give you that health pack?
[33:39.20]Alright, nimble.
[33:43.78]You're coming with me.
[33:45.26]Look at that fucking flash drive, you punk.
[33:56.69]All this to save you.
[34:11.39]Was I not supposed to do that?
[34:15.78]Should I not have done that?
[34:16.80]Should I restart it?
[34:17.88]Should I go rewind?
[34:21.20]Is that a bad thing?
[34:22.68]Did I lose, like, an item for that?
[34:31.29]You can do it.
[34:32.35]Bad ending.
[34:32.91]Bad.
[34:33.25]Reset.
[34:33.75]Reset it.

[34:35.71]Well, whatever.
[34:36.97]Alright.
[34:38.70]He's from Bright Era.
[34:41.73]There's another quest to do.
[34:42.69]Okay, I won't kill him then.
[34:50.32]Yeah, let's go.
[34:55.04]Listen, I need that flash drive you were taking to the trader.
[34:56.90]Do you have it?
[34:59.02]Uh, yeah, I got it.
[34:59.68]Those morons can't even do a proper search.
[35:01.46]Well, what the heck, take it.
[35:02.44]After all you saved my life, it was well hidden because thugs can't risk for shit.
[35:06.34]Got the flash drive and got the information.
[35:09.57]Now I can kill him.
[35:13.81]I didn't keep it down there, so don't worry.
[35:15.85]Down is underwear.
[35:17.61]I've worked for Trader for a long time, so I can store information safely.
[35:21.29]By the way, I told the thugs a nice little story about a cache full of artifacts, and they ordered one guy to go there.
[35:27.10]The cache exists, but it's only got one artifact.
[35:29.78]I can give you its coordinates if you want.
[35:31.84]Uh, yeah.
[35:35.25]Sure, thanks.
[35:35.73]But don't forget, there's lots of wild animals there.
[35:38.23]Besides, the gangster they sent is armed with more than a scoop and a shovel, so be careful.
[35:42.77]Well, thanks.
[35:43.85]Good luck.
[35:46.21]Okay.

[36:48.04]Yeah, alright.
[36:50.07]He needs a medpack.
[36:50.97]Well, I don't have one of those.

[37:17.03]Okay, if I just got so scared for a second, I was like, why is this guy standing up?
[37:22.02]So, on the mini-map over here, right?
[37:23.56]See this, like... What's with the little crosshair, the survey thing right there?

[42:20.02]Well, where the fuck, what is blinking in there?
[42:29.84]The glowing thing is the artifact, but it's being blocked by the thing called the anomaly.
[42:33.18]Hold on.
[42:37.49]I gotta do some fucking reading for a second.
[42:39.47]How do I pull up the thing?
[42:42.27]Throw the bolt at the anomaly and run through fast.
[42:44.53]That's what I was gonna try to do.
[42:49.32]It was like a second, though.

[43:36.24]Because for some reason, and now we're like in a different fucking... Oh my god, everything reset.
[43:43.88]Why did everything reset?
[43:46.65]Even like the video options reset.
[43:52.37]Because every fucking video game hates my existence.
[43:57.84]And I will have massive issues every single time I try to play any video game, no matter what.
[44:04.54]It's just what's going to happen.

[44:51.94]Like half of everybody in chat told me not to get it and half of everybody said to get it.
[44:59.18]Alright, let's go.

[45:46.40]What?
[45:50.91]Okay.
[45:54.25]Okay, so that's not even, is that even the right one?
[45:59.11]That sounds fucking horrible.

[47:08.96]Cam inert zero.
[47:10.60]Alright, that's better.
[47:15.87]I mean... Hold on a second.
[47:23.63]Can I just, like, drop down here?
[47:25.01]Is it right there?

[47:28.14]That's not gonna kill me, is it?
[47:34.74]No, that's like the outside.

[48:20.83]Quick save right next to the quick load.
[48:22.55]Alright, yeah.
[48:24.59]So that just drops me there.
[48:31.17]Alright, well, you know, I ain't gonna sit here any longer.
[48:34.77]I can come back.
[48:35.31]I can always just come back.
[48:37.09]I'm not gonna fucking spend like fucking 30 minutes trying to figure this out.
[48:39.67]There's like five missions to do.
[48:44.67]Why T?
[48:45.13]I don't know.
[48:46.35]T's where it's at.
[48:49.13]Just crouch?
[48:49.89]I... Alright, just for the sake of trying this one last time for you guys, I'm gonna throw a fucking thing in here and sprint and crouch.
[49:00.54]Nope.
[49:01.00]That ain't gonna work.
[49:07.97]Didn't work.
[49:08.93]Sorry.
[49:12.45]Let's go.
[49:13.33]Put the car in reverse.
[49:15.86]Let's see.
[49:16.10]Where am I?
[49:18.88]Cash is on the roof.
[49:21.22]I'll come back.
[49:22.00]I'm not sitting around trying to find ways to run around fucking hidden secrets.
[49:28.85]Where the fuck am I?
[49:37.26]Let's go this way.
[49:39.66]There's a stash on the roof.
[49:42.22]No.
[49:43.84]I'm cursed with this thing.
[49:44.88]I'm going to go to the... God damn it.
[49:46.40]There's a fucking dog.
[49:51.55]Shift and crouch.
[49:52.39]I mean, I'm pressing those buttons.
[50:00.31]Oh, shit.
[50:00.83]There's another one of those dump holes.
[50:05.30]Oh, God.
[50:06.28]How often do those anomalies even appear?
[50:14.77]I gotta make sure I'm even going the right way.
[50:20.95]Is there a way I can, like, center this shit on where my character is?
[50:23.29]Because I, like, zoomed out accidentally.
[50:25.59]Where the hell even am I?
[50:26.73]Like, why the fuck would you... When I press M, why in the name of God would you fucking put me over there?
[50:32.38]Are you a fucking stupid video game?
[50:34.26]Are you stupid?! !
[50:42.94]two three four five I did that stupid there's a center button well the game didn't tell me what it was uh what does it want me to do over there go in there alright give me my money
[51:15.66]Hello.
[51:16.84]Got anything valuable?
[51:19.42]Situation has become cleared up.
[51:21.28]Where's the flash drive?
[51:22.00]There you go.
[51:28.25]Ah, here it is.
[51:30.61]Money, 1,500 monies.
[51:33.39]Get the information from the scout.
[51:36.39]Got it.
[51:36.85]Okay.
[51:39.08]Anything else?
[51:39.64]Ruples.
[51:53.51]Let's assume I want to find this guy, sure.
[51:55.11]Go raid the military base.
[51:57.17]Maybe I should research my fucking games?
[52:17.32]This was like a requested game from people in chat.
[52:20.22]Sorry I didn't go to like school for like fucking two semesters to figure out how to play the game like an hour ago.
[52:26.53]Come on, man.
[52:27.09]Give me a break.
[52:35.81]Let's do it.
[52:36.35]Alright, listen.
[52:37.59]You mean business.
[52:38.81]I can see that.
[52:39.79]And I... I mean... We need guys like you.
[52:44.10]We're doing sort of an investigation with some other traders.
[52:48.20]We want to open up a path to the north, to the center of the zone.
[52:52.79]And near the center, something or someone is trying to hamper our progress.
[52:58.97]How the heck this Trelok managed to sneak through, I don't know.
[53:02.68]You see, there's this one area where your brain starts boiling.
[53:07.60]An eerie place.
[53:09.88]Anyway, to cut a long story short, a couple of guys have been spying on those grunts for me, not far from here.
[53:17.22]Apparently the ones at the agro-prom research institute have dug up something, something major.
[53:22.48]I'm positive it has something to do with the center of the zone.
[53:25.89]Anyway, whatever they've dug up, it's secured somewhere in the third floor of the institute.
[53:30.93]We really need this stuff.
[53:32.55]You know what I mean?
[53:35.52]Once you have the briefcase, don't bring it here.
[53:37.69]Take it straight to the barman.
[53:39.39]He runs the stalker bar at 100 rads.
[53:42.15]I'll upload the coordinates and all the data you need to your PDA.
[53:45.45]Clear.
[53:46.17]Find the military's documents.
[53:47.41]Go to the railroad embankment.
[53:48.91]You'll need to go north through the garbage, then turn west.
[53:52.85]Go through the garbage.
[53:53.70]You'll be there soon.
[53:56.86]And be careful.
[53:57.78]The radiation level is way too high at the garbage.
[54:00.74]So I suggest you invest in some anti-rad.
[54:04.33]Or drink some vodka.
[54:06.27]Good luck.
[54:10.03]Okay.
[54:13.17]Well, I don't need any of this shit, right?
[54:16.74]It's pretty useless.
[54:21.48]I have two of these.
[54:24.70]These are all like the exact same thing, right?
[54:26.30]Yeah.
[54:29.43]With this, like, tourist delight canned food.
[54:31.81]I have two of these shotguns.
[54:34.27]Wait, which one's the most durable?
[54:36.63]Hold on.
[54:40.00]Okay, this one is the most durable.
[54:43.02]This one is also less durable.
[54:44.80]You can take that one.
[54:52.37]I think I want to keep this stuff, right?
[54:55.45]Vodka.
[54:55.87]Vodka.
[54:58.45]Reduce the effects of radiation.
[55:01.93]Okay, how much are these?
[55:02.63]$200 fucking dollars.
[55:07.66]Break.
[55:08.04]Med kit.
[55:08.50]I need some of these.
[55:09.42]How much is this if I do this?
[55:13.00]Alright, two pizzas and a grape soda.
[55:21.91]Oh, I have money.
[55:22.59]I mean, is this a stupid thing?
[55:24.05]Is this dumb, what I'm doing here?
[55:29.47]Dollars?
[55:30.39]Rubles.
[55:30.71]I know, rubles, rubles.
[55:31.63]I mean, is this a bad idea?
[55:34.14]Am I, like, wasting money?
[55:41.52]Take the med kit?
[55:43.86]Doesn't matter.
[55:45.77]Okay.
[55:46.01]That should be good.
[55:47.65]Let's go get this done.

[56:45.57]I'm ready.
[56:50.33]Take the medkit to my friend.
[56:54.01]I mean... I need it.
[56:57.17]I need this shit.

[57:30.46]Let's go kill the bandits at the car park.
[57:35.98]I'm okay with that.
[57:36.84]Are those... That's not the right way.
[57:49.72]This is the right way.
[57:56.83]Kill Wolf.
[57:58.41]Why would I want to do that?
[58:00.89]Isn't he like a guy that I want to stick around with?
[58:11.23]Let's go kill all the bandits.
[58:19.45]Wait.
[58:21.95]Hold on a second.
[58:25.01]Didn't I just do this?
[58:30.36]This is the first mission.
[58:32.94]I guess it's... Okay.
[58:34.18]Well, maybe I will give the fucking medkit to that guy.
[58:40.38]Where is he?
[58:41.74]Like, should I give the medkit to this guy?
[58:43.10]I mean... Is it worth doing this?
[58:56.20]It's just a waste.
[58:56.90]Okay.
[58:57.92]Hey, you want to trade?
[59:05.15]Hey, I'll trade you some bread.
[59:07.58]Why would I need to trade with him?
[59:11.44]He's like dying.
[59:12.18]Okay, let's just go.
[59:21.30]Can't go that way.

[59:40.64]I know.
[59:41.56]God damn it!
[59:45.10]Ugh!
[59:46.46]It's one of those whirlwind anomalies.
[59:48.11]And now I'm poisoned or something.
[59:49.29]What's wrong with me?
[59:49.73]Am I bleeding?
[59:56.93]I don't know.
[59:57.31]What does that mean?
[59:58.43]I think that's like
[60:00.87]Somebody's crying.
[60:05.17]No, I thought that was the knife.
[60:11.53]Anything?
[60:15.14]Smash the big crates?
[60:16.06]Little crates?
[60:16.44]Does it matter, like, which ones?
[60:17.38]I don't think it matters.
[60:24.26]Ooh, what's that?
[60:33.33]I got something.
[60:33.85]I got a Plants vs. Zombies helmet.
[60:38.09]Alright, what was that?

[60:40.91]Okay, cool.
[60:44.03]Nice.
[60:44.26]That works.
[60:44.66]Ah!
[60:44.74]God damn it, man.
[61:01.43]These things are fucking really, really... I don't like those.
[61:04.92]They're too scary.
[61:05.94]They make the game scary.
[61:14.06]Alright, here we go.
[61:15.52]Gonna talk to this guy.
[61:17.52]I think I just got hurt.
[61:18.76]What is happening?
[61:19.62]Is it on the truck?
[61:21.66]Where is it?
[61:24.00]Who is this guy?
[61:29.80]Wasn't I supposed to meet with someone here?

[61:54.23]I guess not.
[62:00.79]I don't know what- I hear a bunch of the fucking noises, man.
[62:05.15]What is that noise?
[62:05.91]What's with all the beeping?
[62:09.87]Oh!
[62:20.78]This game is just dangerous shit, the video game.
[62:24.60]I almost did it.
[62:42.66]Master disaster.
[62:43.82]I threw a bolt out and it didn't even make it.
[62:49.65]Hold on, I need to look at this.
[62:53.35]Okay.
[63:02.62]I'm very confused by this.
[63:22.33]The anomalies just move on their own.
[63:26.65]So, this... Okay, anomalies.
[63:33.87]I only have one thing in my fucking encyclopedia about it.
[63:37.96]It's the Whirlygig anomaly.
[63:42.14]Like, what do you guys want me to read?
[63:45.45]I have one thing in my fucking, whatever, the Dear Diary?
[63:49.19]I got fucking electrocuted?
[63:50.47]Like, what are you talking about?
[63:59.96]Dead Rookies PDF... Okay, uh, alright, alright.
[64:02.83]But I gotta read somebody's diary.
[64:12.45]Th-that doesn't help at all.
[64:25.78]Okay, so let's see here.
[64:39.25]So I need to like find like the correct path to not step on certain things?
[64:45.97]So this is safe.
[64:51.24]So what about like there?
[64:53.78]That's safe.
[64:55.68]So is that.
[65:00.38]Is it safe all the way up?
[65:01.56]Oh Christ.
[65:13.10]I'm just getting struck by fucking lightning.
[65:18.70]So wait, so are these things... When the lightning strikes, does that mean I can't walk?
[65:24.62]I have no idea what the fuck is going on.
[65:26.90]I have to like, I have to like follow it forward.
[65:34.69]So it's just, these just move, so this is moving.
[65:53.62]I can see the lighting on the ground, but like what does that even matter like I have to wait till that moves right yes So it's gone now.
[66:02.46]I'm safe here now I'm safe to move to here
[66:11.53]shit was just like what like this is so easy I'm just oh I just overcome what the fuck is going on here I'm like dying I apparently touched it
[66:39.28]I didn't move fast enough.
[66:40.97]What the fuck?
[66:45.43]Dude, alright, so, like, I thought the lightning strikes were happening, like, on their own.
[66:51.28]Like, this is so incredibly easy.

[67:10.85]Come on.
[67:11.93]God fucking damn it.
[67:15.36]Oh my god.
[67:17.76]The particle effect.
[67:18.88]Okay.
[67:21.78]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[67:29.85]I waited.
[67:30.49]No, I didn't.
[67:31.11]There was still shit all over the ground.
[67:35.09]Like the little sprite particle effect like that ended.
[67:45.80]Come on.
[67:47.88]See, I went like there.
[67:48.80]See, it happened again.
[67:50.00]It actually fucking happened again.
[67:58.30]It like stopped appearing on the, like for a split second it wasn't on the screen.
[68:01.66]Get off.
[68:02.18]Go.
[68:03.54]Oh my god.
[68:20.27]This is fucking stupid.
[68:24.55]Like, really, come on, man.
[68:26.47]This is so easy, but for some reason it keeps fucking hitting me.
[68:41.76]What the fuck?
[68:42.20]Why is it?
[68:43.03]What?
[68:43.85]What?
[68:44.43]What?
[68:45.03]What?
[68:46.43]You guys are seeing the same screen I am, okay?
[68:49.33]You guys are seeing the same screen.
[68:51.17]There was nothing on the ground.
[68:55.89]What the fuck?
[68:58.77]What?
[69:02.92]What?
[69:03.16]Like, really?
[69:04.32]Really?
[69:04.64]What happened there?
[69:05.78]What happened there, chat?
[69:18.70]Where is it?
[69:19.56]Where is it?
[69:20.46]Where is it?
[69:21.54]Where is it on the screen?
[69:45.71]Oh my God.
[69:54.31]I can't even fucking, like... Just stack on steroids and run.
[70:12.22]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[70:14.18]I like, this is just an anomaly stream.
[70:18.24]Where I run into fucking electricity for fucking two hours.
[70:25.37]Can I not stand on this?
[70:26.35]Okay, now it is showing up.
[70:33.65]Why was it not showing up before?
[70:34.75]Is it dead?
[70:41.94]What is this?
[70:45.94]I did it.
[70:46.24]I fucking made it.
[70:47.04]I made it through this stupid anomaly.
[70:54.24]It was always showing up.
[70:55.22]No, it wasn't.
[70:55.72]Go back and watch.
[70:57.22]Nothing was on the ground.
[71:01.57]There was literally a master difficulty.
[71:05.09]The lightning is increasing.
[71:06.29]What?
[71:07.81]I don't believe that for a second.
[71:14.54]Jesus Christ.
[71:22.93]Do it again to prove yourself.
[71:24.29]No, I don't even want to do that again.
[71:25.61]Where the hell am I going?
[71:44.44]What's this?
[71:48.18]Watch, I'm going to run into this.
[71:49.26]There's going to be an anomaly on the ground over here.
[71:55.38]I'm gonna go in this house, there's gonna be like a fire hydrant spraying water in five directions.
[72:07.25]This game wasn't made for casual scum.
[72:09.29]Well, who was it made for?
[72:10.33]Who was it made for then?
[72:13.51]For you?
[72:15.95]When they develop this game, and what the fuck is this giant beetle bug?
[72:19.37]Like fucking pig monster.
[72:21.16]Great.
[72:22.02]That's just fucking great.
[72:24.02]Now there's two pig beetles.
[72:25.40]This is fucking awesome.
[72:29.88]Hey.
[72:31.42]Turn around.
[72:33.55]Turn around, dude.
[72:34.47]Help me with the fucking pig monsters.
[72:36.63]Turn around.
[72:37.67]Turn around and fight.
[72:38.91]Fight these guys.
[72:41.27]What are you... Okay, well he's like a distraction.
[72:47.59]I don't know what's going on over here, but whatever.
[72:48.86]I... What the fuck was that?
[72:57.52]Where'd they go?
[72:57.98]Oh, they... Okay, they left.
[73:03.13]Five fucking medkits.
[73:05.35]That's fucking fantastic.
[73:06.59]Good.
[73:13.86]Alright, well...
[73:18.61]What are you doing?
[73:19.47]Help me.
[73:23.21]If you don't see them, they can't see you.
[73:25.20]I know, really.
[73:27.34]The old thing they used to tell you back in theater.
[73:30.58]Don't open up the curtain and look at the audience, because if you see them, they can see you.
[73:34.84]Alright, we got what we needed.
[73:36.20]Let's go.
[73:40.60]Save that guy?
[73:41.36]No, no, they left.
[73:43.81]Okay.
[73:45.45]Here's where I need to go.
[73:46.73]Wounded Fox...
[73:50.71]Guess I'm just going to search the houses and find this wounded fox guy.
[73:54.34]Sounds like a plan.
[74:00.06]I wouldn't even look.
[74:01.65]And I just saved it, so I'm going to load that save.
[74:09.64]Incoming dogs.
[74:21.01]I don't care about that guy.
[74:21.85]I wonder, do I have to kill this guy?
[74:42.44]Wounded fox, like an animal?
[74:44.08]Wait, it's actually like a wounded animal.
[74:47.94]No, it's a guy.
[74:51.23]Hello.
[74:53.45]Medkit, give me a medkit.
[74:55.17]Take one.
[75:03.44]You're welcome, by the way.
[75:07.38]Why can't I get information?
[75:11.72]I didn't give me any information.
[75:17.31]Did I get info or something?
[75:19.37]What the hell was that?
[75:25.31]Help Fox.
[75:26.11]Get information about... Steal the documents.
[75:42.90]What are you doing?
[75:43.46]Is it...
[75:54.11]What are you looking at?
[75:55.63]Can I take care of whatever you're looking at here?
[75:56.95]Are you looking at the birds?
[76:07.60]Is there like a... Should I... He's in combat.
[76:12.56]Well, what is he in combat with?
[76:14.00]There's nothing around the house.
[76:18.04]I have to go on like a hunt for whatever this guy thinks he sees?
[76:29.90]He's not aiming at, like, these guys down here, is he?
[76:31.96]Just reload?
[76:35.06]Okay.
[76:35.60]Well.
[76:37.74]Let's... Oh, you guys are talking about just save it in here and then reload it.
[76:43.69]Okay.
[76:54.69]Okay.
[76:55.49]Last save.
[76:57.35]Are you ready to talk to me?
[77:01.74]There we go.
[77:03.10]Hi there.
[77:05.14]Fox loser.
[77:06.88]Thanks.
[77:07.13]Okay, now I'm listening very carefully.
[77:08.45]Trader told me you might know something about Strelok.
[77:11.33]Why is everyone taking such a keen interest in him lately?
[77:13.35]Okay, I can't say.
[77:14.03]I know him personally.
[77:15.17]We didn't communicate, though.
[77:16.19]My guys took some shots at him once.
[77:18.51]No one got hurt.
[77:19.11]It was just making fun of him.
[77:20.49]It was clear his party had been waiting for someone else, so we parted in peace.
[77:23.72]Cussed each other out across a... What the fuck are you doing?
[77:32.81]What happened?
[77:34.13]Slow down!
[77:48.52]Where did these dogs come from?
[77:50.58]Why did they all spawn in here?
[77:54.27]He's gonna die?
[78:01.46]What the fuck?
[78:07.80]It's scripted?
[78:09.70]It's scripted.
[78:10.60]So you're telling me that this is fucking scripted.
[78:12.34]So I sit here and say, hey, how are you?
[78:14.20]And then all of a sudden, let's go!
[78:15.40]Okay.
[78:17.84]Meet with Siri and learn something about Strelok from Fox.
[78:22.60]Are you sure that was scripted?
[78:25.46]I'll dish you his coordinates so you can have a chat.
[78:27.42]He knows more about Strelok.
[78:28.52]Be careful at that exit.
[78:29.96]A small gang has set... Okay, maybe it is scripted.
[78:39.34]That was a little beep.
[78:46.18]There's a lot of...
[78:54.37]Shoot him!
[78:54.85]You have a shotgun, dude!
[78:58.15]We're done with those mutants.
[79:07.45]Okay.
[79:09.11]Thanks.
[79:11.05]Saved me twice, so it was scripted.
[79:13.21]Thanks for the $1500.
[79:13.99]Okay, see you.
[79:18.15]Thanks, dude.
[79:18.97]Appreciate it.
[79:22.16]What was that?
[79:23.04]A foxtail.
[79:23.75]Why did I kill those dogs?
[79:24.69]I'm sorry.
[79:25.05]I really didn't mean to.
[79:25.79]I had to, though.
[79:26.25]Okay, so... This is... Nimble... Why is he still on the minimap?
[79:30.55]This is bugged out.
[79:31.10]Alright, so...
[79:52.84]Learn something of Strelok from Sirai.
[79:56.46]Let's just go up here.
[80:00.04]On the way up there, we'll just keep moving.
[80:04.07]We'll see if we can find anything up there.
[80:07.79]Stash.
[80:08.63]Wait.
[80:09.03]Hold on a second.
[80:16.11]I'm going to look at this house.
[80:19.23]He's on my map because he has a reward.
[80:20.93]Okay.
[80:23.88]Anything in here that I need to get?
[80:25.38]Anything upstairs?
[80:32.83]Any hidden secrets?
[80:33.85]There's some hidden crates.
[80:41.03]Nothing.
[80:42.45]What about over here?
[80:43.01]I don't think I can break these.
[80:52.41]Just go down.
[80:56.88]Whoa!
[80:57.80]Oh, wait.
[80:58.30]Wait a second.
[80:58.68]Give me that.
[81:01.04]What was that?
[81:04.34]A wrench it.
[81:10.31]Oh, shit.
[81:13.95]Okay, cool.
[81:14.83]Thanks for the stuff.
[81:17.57]I thought that was an anomaly.
[81:18.49]It turned out it was just like an artifact or something.
[81:20.96]That's cool.
[81:22.22]We gotta wrench it.
[81:27.72]I think I want to avoid this.
[81:31.40]This does not bode well for me.
[81:34.26]There's just people everywhere.
[81:35.84]That guy's shooting at me now.
[81:41.39]I want to get like a rifle or something.
[81:52.85]God damn it.
[81:56.93]Holy shit.
[82:08.42]How are those not hitting him?
[82:09.82]I really don't know.
[82:13.93]He's like trying to sneak up on me.
[82:26.99]Pistol's way too inaccurate.
[82:29.97]Does this have any bullets?
[82:35.96]Zero.
[82:37.30]Unfortunately.
[82:37.92]I don't have any bullets in this either.
[82:48.68]I'm just fucking surrounded.
[82:50.13]Holy God.
[82:57.05]Oh, you have a lot of shit.
[82:58.09]There's a dead body over here.
[83:02.27]There's something.
[83:05.89]What is this?
[83:07.85]What's in here?
[83:16.29]It's just chaos.
[83:21.49]Ah, what is that noise?
[83:22.22]I hear a dog.
[83:23.66]Close.
[83:31.65]Shit.
[83:31.89]Fucking just take everything.
[83:43.04]Always take everything.
[83:45.30]It's very important.
[83:50.61]What is in the road here?
[83:52.39]There's like a cache right there.
[84:01.44]I hear something.
[84:04.58]We're fighting over this thing, I assume.
[84:06.58]That's what's going on, right?
[84:07.48]There's an anomaly right there, though.
[84:13.30]I want to try to get this if I can.
[84:24.68]God damn it.
[84:25.30]Come here.
[84:27.76]God damn it!
[84:30.05]Ah!
[84:31.81]So, I asked this before.
[84:33.69]Is there a way to toggle?
[84:36.27]I don't think there is.
[84:37.97]When you right-click to aim down sights, I have so much trouble holding down right mouse button.
[84:42.19]Is there a way to toggle aim down sights?
[84:48.80]Because that just bothers me.
[84:55.40]I don't think so.
[84:56.92]Damn it.
[85:00.10]Oh, well.
[85:10.03]Toggle ADS, yeah.
[85:12.98]I wish.
[85:22.70]I gotta kill.
[85:23.18]I forgot I didn't save after I killed this guy.
[85:25.98]Hip fire is accurate at close range.
[85:32.76]I just gotta get better at shooting.
[85:34.30]That's what matters.
[85:45.53]Shit, he saw me.
[85:49.94]He doesn't know what to do!
[85:50.78]I tried.
[85:57.59]I tried to go for like a frontal face stab.
[86:00.93]Didn't work.
[86:21.41]We're good.
[86:24.35]This is going to be a dead serious stream.
[86:26.81]It is.
[86:27.49]This is dead serious.
[86:28.46]Alright.
[86:28.76]I need to fucking be careful here.
[86:31.60]Where are they?
[86:32.24]I see them like popping up.
[86:33.26]There's like a... When the character wears a radioactive artifact on his belt or enters an area with high level of background, he starts losing health and exhibits signs of radiation poisoning.
[86:42.74]Okay.
[86:43.30]So I have vodka.
[86:44.96]I'm just going to drink a vodka.
[86:49.23]And we're going in.
[86:57.19]What else is over here?
[86:59.01]Get out.
[86:59.59]Get out.
[86:59.85]I'm stuck on the fucking wall.
[87:02.55]What else is over there?
[87:03.73]Oh my god.
[87:14.64]I clipped into the fucking... The stupid wire is hanging off of the car.
[87:21.50]Alright.
[87:22.56]Hold on.
[87:30.17]I'm gonna eat this.
[87:32.69]Let's eat both of these.
[87:35.50]And then... Reduces the effects of radiation.
[87:39.92]How long does this last?
[87:48.79]I need to just think about this for a second.
[87:51.23]Does this last a while?
[87:53.97]Don't take it... Take it afterwards.
[87:56.42]So it's an instant thing.
[87:57.28]Okay.
[87:58.10]I didn't know if it was a thing that I had to pop or... Alright, let's get in there.
[88:10.40]Okay.
[88:13.62]Is that all that was over there?
[88:19.54]So what was that thing that I picked up over here then?
[88:22.04]What are these?
[88:23.89]These are Domino's pizzas.
[88:29.11]Army first aid kit.
[88:30.57]Okay, so Domino's and then like Papa John's.
[88:34.07]Alright.
[88:36.03]Whoa!
[88:45.16]I'm still dying.
[88:48.80]Hold on.
[88:49.46]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[88:50.22]That was a waste.
[88:51.24]Hold on.
[88:54.76]That was a full waste of equipment.
[88:55.78]I don't need to do that.
[89:00.42]Okay, so... Let's get... Let's eat my two things.
[89:06.53]Get in there.
[89:07.21]Get out.
[89:09.53]Grab what we need to grab.
[89:10.57]Go!
[89:10.85]Okay.
[89:12.01]And then, bang.
[89:12.53]Bang.
[89:12.69]Okay, right?
[89:13.27]Okay.
[89:24.30]I think I got it.
[89:27.06]And we have three pizzas now.
[89:28.34]Good.
[89:29.18]Alright, let's loot some people.
[89:32.78]The loot all button.
[89:34.16]Can I press like that?
[89:37.28]Is there like an actual just like keyboard press?
[89:48.08]It'll go away.
[89:49.04]It's gone.
[89:49.48]It's gone now.
[89:50.82]Secret stash under the cross.
[89:57.27]Alright, good.
[89:59.75]So as I play... I'm starting to see how... I'm starting to get it.
[90:07.73]I'm starting to understand the game.
[90:12.15]Shit.
[90:24.80]Help me.
[90:26.76]I need some help here.
[90:29.80]Dogs.
[90:34.66]That was really loud.
[90:36.29]Okay, well what you have on your friend?
[90:37.85]I will take your fucking pizza.
[90:39.57]I'll take your sausage pizza.
[90:40.81]I'm not going to stop that one.
[90:44.27]You honestly think I'm going to stop making that dumb reference?
[90:47.73]Okay, are these... Can I like actually use this?
[90:52.02]Seven bullets.
[90:59.88]How accurate is this?
[91:00.62]I don't think it's that accurate.
[91:15.21]You dead?
[91:23.51]Safe.
[91:26.51]Unload the guns you don't use.
[91:27.65]I'm gonna sell them.
[91:32.45]I need, like, health.
[91:33.21]How much health do you get for this?
[91:37.25]Not very much.
[91:39.03]These things, like, suck.
[91:39.89]I'd rather sell these.
[91:41.25]Energy drink?
[91:44.55]Am I bleeding right now?
[91:45.83]No.
[91:47.61]I don't want to use my medkits.
[91:56.89]Where's this guy I'm looking for?
[92:01.31]Move to next level.
[92:05.48]No, what?
[92:08.96]Unload for more ammo.
[92:14.28]Oh, shit.
[92:14.77]Okay.
[92:17.75]That's cool.
[92:22.73]What about these?
[92:30.41]Unload.
[92:36.71]Unload.
[92:38.19]Okay, so which one of the... I have so many random fucking guns.
[92:44.72]I'm going to put the shotgun on.
[92:49.48]Just pick up everything.
[92:50.18]I'm going to sell it.
[92:50.74]Should I not leave?
[92:51.28]Just go to the next level.
[92:59.14]Should I... Is this just like a loading screen or is this like change the... You can come back.
[93:11.63]Okay.
[93:12.77]I was just making sure I wasn't like skipping something or doing something weird.
[93:18.56]Cool.
[93:19.76]I like this game a lot.
[93:23.82]Games like this, you need to like figure them out.
[93:25.74]You need to like figure them out.
[93:26.80]You know what I mean?
[93:27.24]It takes a little while.
[93:30.21]I'm actually enjoying myself a lot.
[93:32.06]Let me put on the SMG.
[93:39.38]Which one do I have ammo for?
[93:40.90]Okay, save it.
[93:48.61]There's a confrontation going on over here.
[93:55.20]Hey guys, I've got nothing!
[93:55.82]You're crushing your artifacts.
[93:56.86]I'm quick, you assholes.
[94:10.19]What?
[94:11.05]Why would you say that?
[94:12.47]Why would you do that?
[94:13.39]I'm trying to like fucking rescue you.
[94:15.67]You don't scream my name as I'm coming to rescue you.
[94:21.95]Why would you do that?
[94:24.66]Hey, look over there, guys.
[94:25.78]The person that's coming to rescue me.
[94:29.82]Why would you ever tell them that?
[94:31.00]Like, I'm fucking trying... Hey, look, there's still the flashlight on.
[94:37.63]Hey, look, it's the bandit.
[94:41.17]What if he doesn't see me?
[94:42.29]Okay, so he's... It doesn't matter.
[94:45.19]If you get close enough.
[94:57.77]It's the bandit!
[94:59.01]Help!
[95:01.01]I feel like some of those should have been headshots.
[95:15.37]Alright, you're good.
[95:18.51]Thanks, man.
[95:18.85]You really helped me out.
[95:19.59]I won't forget it.
[95:20.19]What's going on here?
[95:21.73]Uh, we're trying to clear the garbage of bandits by friends of...
[95:28.41]Squad.
[95:29.09]We've kicked the bandits out of the derelict machinery scrapyard.
[95:32.82]Expecting counterattack.
[95:34.44]We're low on numbers, so everyone's welcome to give us a helping hand.
[95:38.80]Okay, so respond to call for help if I want to.
[95:44.78]Let's do it.
[95:45.90]You have anything on you?
[95:49.30]Let's go.
[95:50.22]Can you tell me something interesting?
[95:51.65]See you.
[95:56.27]Heal.
[95:58.05]Put on this other gun.
[96:02.49]Do I have any bullets in this?
[96:05.63]No.
[96:07.75]I have plenty of shotgun ammo, though.
[96:09.25]Alright, let's do it.
[96:11.57]Let me loot some bodies.
[96:19.16]This guy over here.
[96:22.08]Is your dead body...
[96:27.28]I actually kind of like this more than I like Fallout.
[96:29.92]I don't know why.
[96:31.88]It feels more real.
[96:35.00]It feels more dangerous than Fallout does.
[96:38.20]Didn't I complain about that when we first started playing?
[96:50.22]Alright.
[96:50.42]We probably should... Is this guy going to let us in?
[96:53.13]Are these military people that we're going to shoot?
[97:03.47]Okay, Bess.
[97:05.67]Hey, Stalker, you're just in time.
[97:06.57]We could really use your help.
[97:07.39]These bandit bastards are trying to take control of the garbage.
[97:10.37]We had a shootout here half an hour ago and managed to take down three of the dogs.
[97:14.21]The others retreated.
[97:15.45]But I'm dead certain that they're going to come back with reinforcements any minute now.
[97:18.08]There aren't too many of us left and another man wouldn't hurt.
[97:21.74]We set up an ambush for them here.
[97:22.82]They'll be coming from the west from the AgriProm Research Institute.
[97:26.16]Help us destroy their reinforcements and you won't regret it.
[97:29.92]You got it.
[97:32.70]Repel the bandit raid.
[97:33.86]Okay, let's do it.
[97:40.36]So, the bandit raid.
[97:45.37]We gotta take control of the trash.
[97:47.51]Don't you guys know?
[97:49.23]He who controls the trash controls the world.
[97:58.18]Shift F. Oh, Christ.
[98:00.62]You can pick people up?
[98:01.94]How do I put them down?
[98:02.56]I like that.
[98:05.52]Okay.
[98:08.44]Let's get in position.
[98:09.36]Here they come.
[98:11.75]There's a lot of people coming.
[98:28.37]Let them come in first.
[98:31.97]This is an ambush, don't... Okay, so I don't know if I... I don't know if we... Did we do it right?
[98:36.15]Oh, there's a lot of fucking people who shoot here.
[98:39.47]That guy... How did you get in here?
[98:42.93]Who let him in?
[98:44.09]Where did that guy come from?
[98:48.00]That guy was on the side.
[98:49.62]I'm gonna die.
[98:51.24]I'm bleeding bad.
[99:07.05]Damn it, they're too far away.
[99:12.70]There he is, right there.
[99:16.82]I'm wrapping around.
[99:17.60]Where are you going?
[99:21.02]Got him.
[99:21.66]Come on.
[99:22.62]Propel to bandit raid.
[99:23.26]What do you think I'm doing, man?
[99:25.34]Oh, wait.
[99:25.68]Task failed.
[99:26.44]What do you mean, task failed?
[99:33.00]Task failed, apparently.
[99:34.75]I guess we failed.
[99:40.06]So now what?
[99:44.74]I guess we're still going.
[99:46.42]They killed all the friends.
[99:51.00]So I gotta be faster.
[99:51.92]Well then I'm just gonna load it.
[99:55.85]I gotta go quick.
[99:57.01]We're doing shotgun strats then.
[100:05.92]What?
[100:06.50]What happened?
[100:07.06]What do you mean?
[100:07.97]What?
[100:08.49]Was that a good guy?
[100:09.15]Is this a guy on my team?
[100:10.65]What happened?
[100:12.83]What?
[100:22.52]I think I just lose.
[100:24.32]I didn't do it fast enough.
[100:26.90]It just fucking started.
[100:37.47]Uh... Where's the... Okay, I gotta like protect... Hold on!
[100:52.26]I gotta save him!
[100:53.62]Save him!
[100:54.98]God damn it!
[101:00.20]I can't like tackle him?
[101:03.64]Where's the guy that shoots him?
[101:11.17]What?
[101:11.43]Did we... Did we do it?
[101:13.33]Watch out!
[101:13.71]Watch out!
[101:14.21]Watch out!
[101:15.64]Is he dead?
[101:20.00]He's still alive.
[101:20.52]We're okay.
[101:23.10]Oh, shit!
[101:24.14]Oh, shit!
[101:34.99]Alright, we're good.
[101:40.97]That guy was just... That guy was, like, buying weed over there and, like, turned around and shot me and crouched.
[101:49.79]That guy did the thing everybody, like, gets angry at about Call of Duty.

[103:47.10]Give it to me.
[103:53.39]Okay.

[104:11.19]Look at all these guns.
[104:12.35]What an idiot.
[104:13.05]Why would I have this many things?
[104:18.68]I've gotta have it all.
[104:19.82]I've gotta pick up everything.
[104:22.48]Give me all the weapons.
[104:29.89]It's too- I have to get it all, though.
[104:36.01]I got that guy.
[104:37.15]There's like two more people over here.
[104:45.86]Take it all.
[104:48.58]Take it all.
[104:51.46]Talk to Bess, yes.
[104:52.36]I need to trade with somebody.
[105:01.51]Many rubles.
[105:02.19]I still need to go back to the original town.
[105:04.15]Is it like a fast travel?
[105:05.09]Do I have to walk the whole thing?
[105:06.19]And... that's it.
[105:15.16]Alright, let's do it.
[105:24.20]Yeah, now I control the trash.
[105:28.13]My trash.
[105:28.75]Where'd he go?
[105:30.27]There's no fast travel.
[105:31.31]Oh, damn.
[105:31.65]Where are... Where the hell is he?
[105:42.67]Where'd he go?
[105:43.25]Is he on the bus?
[105:55.37]Wait, is this him?
[105:57.64]Wait.
[106:04.57]Hey, you really helped us out there.
[106:06.40]Will you accept some cash?
[106:07.54]Yeah, sure.
[106:10.16]Here, this should pay for the medical treatment to recover your health.
[106:14.30]Thanks, man.
[106:16.15]Appreciate it.
[106:20.25]I know quite a lot.
[106:21.05]I could share some information with you.
[106:24.49]Tell me about yourself.
[106:27.99]Best is my name.
[106:28.73]I came to these parts a few years ago like many of these guys I was just a fugitive been here ever since so go join the duty Duty fights against the zone.
[106:37.87]I fight with people besides.
[106:39.11]They're too close to link with the government in the army I don't want to wake up in a cold cell one day.
[106:42.93]Well good luck What is this place?
[106:46.37]This is the garbage place?
[106:47.62]Okay?
[106:47.90]Go on there any large buildings in the garbage?
[106:50.96]In the center.
[106:51.46]There's a large hangar
[106:53.91]Usually it's pretty quiet there.
[106:55.10]Worst comes to worst, you can spend the night there.
[106:57.54]If you go west, in the direction of the Agraprom, there's a bandit camp there.
[107:01.58]And that's where those freaks that we killed off a while ago are coming from.
[107:04.16]But I have a feeling that there's more of them.
[107:07.37]Thanks.
[107:07.59]I don't need anything from you.
[107:08.45]I don't need it.
[107:09.07]Take the first aid kit.
[107:09.95]We'll see you.
[107:17.22]Do I need this guy alive?
[107:19.54]Or should I just let him stay?
[107:20.62]Let's trade with him.
[107:22.41]He's got 1500 bucks.
[107:23.29]Hey, look.
[107:23.65]Do you need any guns?
[107:25.45]Wait, I gotta unload these first.
[107:28.77]I'm gonna give this guy a bunch of useless shit.
[107:30.35]It's gonna be great.
[107:36.98]Here.
[107:37.78]You need a bunch of empty guns?
[107:52.61]I'm g- I'm- Yo, talk about garbage, man.
[107:56.45]I'm giving this guy all of my garbage.
[108:02.51]Oh, you can't trade in red?
[108:04.01]Oh, that's too bad.
[108:06.66]Uh... Alright, I'm gonna... Take a first aid kit.
[108:14.22]Let's heal him.
[108:18.44]I'm too heavy to continue.
[108:19.66]Oh, fuck.
[108:23.32]I just picked up one of his guns, right?
[108:26.92]God damn it.
[108:27.68]It's one of these shitty shotguns.
[108:30.90]This one.
[108:31.26]Okay, now I'm no longer heavy.
[108:36.04]Yeah, he woke up and got angry that I had his gun.
[108:37.88]He's looking for a gun.
[108:42.71]Should I give him a gun?
[108:47.43]Tell me anything interesting?
[108:48.55]Alright, well, whatever.
[108:51.81]I need to go back home.
[108:54.03]I have way too many things to sell.
[108:59.45]I'm right here.
[109:00.01]Let me just... Let me try this.
[109:01.54]Let's try to do this shit.
[109:05.98]You know, I came up this far.
[109:07.34]I might as well do this part.
[109:09.06]Trade him a gun?
[109:12.28]Go sell.
[109:12.98]I'm right here.
[109:25.68]Put this away.
[109:26.98]Why can I not?
[109:28.40]Running for a prolonged period of time causes fatigue.
[109:31.98]You can't run or move at a walking pace.
[109:33.24]The more the character is carrying, the faster he tries.
[109:36.27]Standing still.
[109:38.01]I have so many fucking useless weapons.
[109:41.33]Just rest for a second.
[109:43.11]No, there's radiation on me.
[109:44.19]Go!
[109:47.71]I can't even sell half my guns?
[109:50.17]What are you talking about?
[109:57.25]God damn it.
[109:59.51]I'm wearing deep shit.
[110:04.13]Do I honestly need to fucking drink this?
[110:06.77]I actually do.
[110:09.57]Okay, we're good.
[110:13.47]I can't run.
[110:14.07]I gotta get in here.
[110:20.72]Saved it.
[110:22.74]I can't like fucking sneak in somewhere.
[110:24.30]Where's like the front door?
[110:26.98]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[110:35.28]Okay.
[110:37.98]We don't need to carry 25 pistols.
[110:44.56]Like, let's be real.
[110:46.16]Don't need to carry fucking like two dozen pistols.
[110:52.64]I'm coming.
[110:53.68]I'm coming.
[110:54.10]I'm like Santa Claus.
[110:55.02]I have a knapsack full of shit.
[110:58.19]Just keep the door open.
[111:00.25]Yeah, I'll be there in a moment.
[111:02.61]God, I've got presents!
[111:06.33]Hey!
[111:09.11]Yeah!
[111:12.39]Oh no, somebody's in trouble over there.
[111:15.03]Oh, don't worry.
[111:16.19]He's coming to give him a little treat.
[111:17.67]Oh, that's a cigarette.
[111:18.53]You guys are fucking smokers.
[111:20.11]God damn it, I gotta give him first aid.
[111:23.77]Not yet.
[111:24.61]Let's stop the attack first.
[111:28.87]Whoa, whoa, whoa, there's a lot of people.
[111:39.54]There's so many people.
[111:45.64]This is not just a joke.
[111:48.42]This is not a joke.
[111:50.52]Huh?
[111:58.49]I'm panicking.
[112:00.43]I fucking panicked.
[112:07.75]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[112:28.82]Nope.
[112:30.20]Not gonna happen.
[112:38.50]How do I throw this grenade?
[112:43.75]Oh, that's binoculars.
[112:45.19]That's a bolt.
[112:46.13]What's a grenade?
[112:49.89]There it is.
[113:03.77]Drop it!
[113:05.31]Drop!
[113:13.32]Why would you?
[113:13.66]Don't throw the grenade around.
[113:15.12]One grenade and 30 pistols.
[113:24.44]Okay.
[113:25.36]This is where we... I need to do it the right way.
[113:28.70]This is the right way.
[113:30.70]Here we go.
[113:32.35]They're all going to trickle in here.
[113:34.47]I'm not going to use like seven healing potions.
[113:39.55]Here it goes.
[113:40.69]Oh, I thought I could hold it.
[113:50.28]You can't hold the grenade in your hand.
[113:56.61]You can't... You can't... I have to do this.
[114:11.82]What the fuck?
[114:13.26]What the fuck?
[114:13.78]The grenades... Where's the explosive power?
[114:18.29]I'm throwing firecrackers at these guys.
[114:22.42]Alright, fuck it.
[114:22.94]We're just gonna... Alright.
[114:24.28]Alright.
[114:24.86]Hold on.
[114:25.26]The grenades aren't that good.
[114:27.94]It's a toy grenade.
[114:28.58]Okay.
[114:45.93]Whoa, what?
[114:46.37]What was that?
[114:47.35]What was that GoldenEye shit?
[114:49.10]I don't even care.
[114:49.82]Like, that's more shit for me to have to figure out.
[114:52.46]I'm gonna die.
[114:59.28]I'm just gonna do it.
[115:00.17]I'm not gonna throw the fucking grenade.
[115:01.45]Use a machine gun.
[115:19.17]I only took 10 shots.
[115:54.18]Is that it?
[115:55.92]One more?
[115:56.50]Where are you?
[115:58.34]Where's this last guy?
[116:07.07]No, stop picking up the fucking... Stop picking up the pistols.
[116:14.65]Where is he?
[116:17.05]Did he go... He went around?
[116:20.06]Apparently... Okay.
[116:21.18]Well, you got him.
[116:21.96]Nice work.
[116:34.61]There's a guy all the way up there.
[116:37.01]That's the one guy.
[116:37.83]The guy sitting on the fucking roof.
[116:46.71]Jerma985 pistols.
[116:49.82]I got it.
[116:50.18]We gotta get that one guy on the roof all the way down there.
[117:02.25]I'll take it.
[117:13.16]The surgeon.
[117:13.86]Hey, did anybody need any pistols?
[117:19.46]Alright, hey.
[117:20.28]Can we talk now?
[117:21.91]No, you're still in combat.
[117:23.61]Still in combat with something.
[117:24.77]I get unloaded.
[117:32.84]Where is he?
[117:34.42]Can we stop this so I can have a moment?
[117:37.20]Okay, good.
[117:42.49]You, stalker.
[117:44.35]Let's have a chat.
[117:45.25]Okay, well, first of all... Drop them all.
[117:49.81]Drop them all.
[117:53.07]Okay.
[117:53.75]So here... Wait, hold on.
[117:54.87]Wait a minute.
[117:55.87]Wait.
[117:57.93]I fucking... Hold on a second.
[117:58.96]I need to look at these.
[117:59.62]Unload.
[118:01.16]Unload.
[118:19.07]Shut up!
[118:19.91]Stop playing the guitar!
[118:23.79]You knew I was gonna do that.
[118:24.69]Okay, well, let me actually do this now.
[118:28.86]Okay, so we're gonna drop all these.
[118:47.38]These are all on load.
[118:48.54]This one... Which one is the highest durability?
[118:54.59]This one.
[118:55.17]Drop, like... Okay, I'm alright now.
[118:57.23]Let's talk.
[118:59.57]I need information about Strelok.
[119:05.18]You help me out here so it's free.
[119:06.24]I'll tell you, one of the guys, a former digger called Mole, is waiting for me.
[119:10.18]He dug up Strelok's stash, but I don't know if he found anything there.
[119:13.86]You're the coordinates of our meeting place.
[119:15.14]Tell them I sent you.
[119:15.80]They'll be looking for me now.
[119:16.70]Will you please stop saying things?
[119:20.54]So I'm going to disappear for a while.
[119:21.70]Here's some cash for your help.
[119:22.72]Okay, meet with task complete.
[119:25.26]Thanks for the information.
[119:27.66]Tell me something interesting.
[119:29.54]Thanks.
[119:33.21]Okay, so there's like something over here.
[119:38.05]What is over here?
[119:40.85]Is it like on the roof or something?
[119:45.75]Get rid of the pistols.
[119:47.69]I will.
[119:49.51]When I'm good and ready.
[119:55.11]Save that guy?
[119:56.39]No.
[119:57.45]I don't need to save that guy.
[120:00.09]Alright, so this is all this shit over here.
[120:04.70]Stealing documents.
[120:07.04]Meet the mole.
[120:08.70]Get information about the stash.
[120:11.83]I mean... Ugh.
[120:15.43]Yes, this is on master difficulty.
[120:17.35]It is.
[120:19.77]I'm gonna go back.
[120:22.13]I'm gonna go back and sell shit.
[120:27.93]Why the pistols?
[120:28.53]Because I want to go make a bunch of money.
[120:33.02]So I have to... You're telling me I have to go all the way back to... I gotta go all the way back to here.
[120:40.64]Right?
[120:40.80]Where the trader is.
[120:44.82]I gotta get all the way back there.
[120:46.63]And we gotta run the whole thing.
[120:50.55]I'm gonna get 20 bucks.
[120:52.61]Back to the zap tunnel.
[120:53.81]North is a new town.
[120:54.81]Really.
[121:00.64]Okay, yeah.
[121:00.96]There is a town here.
[121:03.22]Who's this?
[121:04.16]Give the documents to the barkeep.
[121:05.56]Alright, we're gonna go up there.
[121:06.67]Okay.
[121:20.21]100 rads?
[121:23.57]We're, uh... This is garbage.
[121:26.28]Uh-oh.
[121:26.50]100 rads.
[121:26.68]What is it up here?
[121:28.92]He's talking about up here, right?
[121:37.47]Cordon.
[121:38.37]Okay.
[121:42.17]100 rads bar.
[121:43.49]So it is the barkeep.
[121:46.39]Let's just go up then.
[121:47.47]We'll go north.
[121:48.78]Make sure I'm going the right way.
[121:49.74]I gotta get out here and then bang a left.
[121:52.16]Yep.
[121:58.78]Up here.
[122:00.94]Make sure I have a gun out.
[122:01.80]Because you know how fucking horrible this place can be.
[122:07.60]I already hear a dog.
[122:09.88]I hear multiple dogs.
[122:18.23]I'm trekking into the wasteland with my hundred pistols.
[122:23.55]What is going on over there?
[122:30.52]Did you guys see that shit?
[122:33.09]They, like, picked up a pig and, like, shot him a thousand miles per hour over there.
[122:48.17]Okay.
[122:48.69]This is a long trek.
[122:51.24]This is a long way to go.
[122:52.38]Use your energy drink.
[122:57.94]That was so dumb.
[122:58.74]I love it.
[123:02.35]Pig thrower.
[123:08.18]Two.
[123:10.36]Okay.
[123:12.76]God damn it.
[123:14.90]Why am I such a fat guy?
[123:18.82]What does this say?
[123:19.56]Is this friendly?
[123:20.62]Hostile?
[123:22.52]I don't speak this language.
[123:26.82]What does this say?
[123:27.48]Okay, well, whatever.
[123:30.77]I'm not going to fight anybody.
[123:34.19]There's always, like, a guy playing the guitar here, though.
[123:38.43]Uh, trade.
[123:39.97]You don't want any of my stuff.
[123:41.94]Of course, everybody wants the pizzas, but you're not getting one pizza.
[123:48.56]What about you?
[123:49.46]No, no one's getting... Don't aim your fucking gun at my head.
[123:53.16]Who's this?
[123:54.62]Whoa!
[123:54.76]Every loser.
[123:55.16]Can I talk to him?
[124:03.94]Buzz off, stalker.
[124:05.48]Halt, stalker.
[124:06.00]You can't go any further.
[124:06.86]Why?
[124:08.02]Because that's our territory.
[124:09.12]Duty territory.
[124:09.96]And we're very picky about who we let through into our base.
[124:12.08]If you don't have anything important to discuss, then get out of here.
[124:16.50]Okay, bye-bye.
[124:16.94]Buzz off, stalker.
[124:17.81]Wait, hold on.
[124:18.21]We don't let every loser go through.
[124:19.61]What if I gave you a fresh Domino's pizza?
[124:22.45]Buzz off, stalker.
[124:23.55]We don't let every loser go through.
[124:25.99]Okay, well, bye then.
[124:27.25]Thanks for nothing.
[124:29.85]Wait.
[124:31.79]That's the way I have to go.
[124:36.11]I have to go this way.
[124:41.11]Um, I thought you guys said to go north.
[124:47.38]Okay.
[124:48.46]Well, looks like we have to go this way.
[124:52.46]God damn it.
[124:57.54]I gotta go get the documents.
[124:58.56]Okay.
[124:59.33]Well.
[125:02.37]I'm getting, I'm getting, I gotta, I gotta dump some fucking pistols and shit, man.
[125:05.88]Like, how much, how much is this way?
[125:07.00]1.9, .3, I gotta dump something.
[125:12.40]I gotta drop some of this shit.
[125:14.02]Like, I have to.
[125:14.96]It's worth $400, though.
[125:23.91]Okay, drop it.
[125:26.83]I really don't want to do that, but I have to.
[125:32.82]Just take a big dump.
[125:35.42]That sucks that I have to go all the way over here.
[125:40.36]I don't need 200 pistol rounds.
[125:47.04]I really do have 259 shots.
[125:50.34]Well, I don't know.
[125:51.32]The way you guys are describing this game made it artifact.
[125:55.02]Thank you very much.
[125:55.86]I will take it.
[125:59.51]Seashell.
[126:03.96]Meat chunk.
[126:06.00]2,500 rubles.
[126:09.90]Yeah, 259 shots.
[126:11.12]One for each gun.
[126:18.13]Do I know how to use artifacts?
[126:19.35]I have no idea what artifacts even are.
[126:23.09]I know that they're like random things that show up in the world.
[126:30.85]I don't have any ammo for this.
[126:40.73]They do not equip health artifacts.
[126:47.87]I can use an inventory slot, okay.
[126:50.77]Use my silenced weapons.
[126:51.97]I have silenced weapons.
[126:55.52]Please drop shit.
[126:58.62]No, I can't.
[127:00.48]Ugh.
[127:11.27]Okay.
[127:11.95]Now I'm only going to pick up a few of them.
[127:16.83]Seriously, it's like... How many of these do I need?
[127:20.73]Okay.
[127:22.39]58.
[127:22.41]Let's get to like... 100.
[127:24.28]That's good.
[127:24.60]177.
[127:24.62]There.
[127:24.74]Like 185 shots.
[127:30.62]That's better.
[127:45.44]Keep all ammo.
[127:46.67]Wait, what?
[127:48.41]The ammo's more useful than the pistols.
[127:52.77]You guys were telling me I had 300 shots and I didn't... Hold on, let me go back to my cigarette pile.
[128:03.52]Okay, let's drop... Another shotgun then.
[128:10.86]And like another pistol.
[128:13.33]Okay.
[128:14.11]And one more pistol.
[128:26.13]Wait, it's all worthless?
[128:30.90]What?
[128:31.26]Hey!
[128:32.24]What?
[128:35.96]What the fuck was that?
[128:47.14]Oh my lord.
[128:47.76]Speaking of pistols.
[128:54.91]Dammit, there's like fucking a dozen of them.
[129:00.37]Am I bleeding?
[129:03.73]Yeah, I am.
[129:17.16]And they're just surrounding me.
[129:18.52]Like, they're fucking just surrounding me.
[129:23.44]Plug up the wound with a sausage.
[129:27.22]We're going this way.
[129:29.10]I can't go that way.
[129:31.45]I have to like wrap the fuck around.
[129:39.35]What am I running into right now?
[129:41.21]Hazardous radiation.
[129:42.19]What do you mean hazardous radiation?
[129:45.68]Why?
[129:46.02]Why am I in hazardous radiation?
[129:52.11]Protection required to pass?
[130:07.86]Help me.
[130:09.14]Help me!
[130:10.46]Help me, help me, help me, help me.
[130:11.30]Do you have anything I can... What is this?
[130:14.43]Reduces radiation.
[130:15.55]I just... Wow, I did it.
[130:18.51]These, like, Japanese candies just made me, like, feel better.
[130:23.99]Let's go.
[130:24.76]Now.
[130:26.70]Thank God I had those fucking Japanese candies.
[130:40.41]This thing's killing me.
[130:41.23]Better keep walking.
[130:44.09]Oh God, what is this?
[130:52.21]The military has us pinned down in the factory.
[130:58.31]Save?
[130:59.09]I literally just got in a cutscene!
[131:00.53]Like, hold on, they're walking by an artifact!
[131:09.58]Alright, let's do it.
[131:10.24]I only have ten shots in this thing.
[131:23.83]We're joining... We're doing... Those guys are good guys.
[131:28.69]The assault on the facility.
[131:30.16]We just have to get in here.
[131:32.42]Got info.
[131:33.24]Get info from the mole.
[131:35.26]I'm bleeding.
[131:53.28]Who is there?
[131:54.04]That guy has a fucking shotgun, I'm so dead.
[132:32.04]It's still like a raid?
[132:33.78]Yep.
[132:34.18]Oh, this is hard.
[133:04.22]Holy shit, man.
[133:05.28]What happened?
[133:11.60]Give me your stuff.
[133:17.09]Don't you guys have any bullets for this shit?
[133:20.51]How is this... Thank you.
[133:23.39]Jesus.
[133:23.93]What?
[133:32.11]There's just 10,000 people around this corner.
[133:44.08]These guys don't even get cover.
[133:45.39]All my guys are gone.
[133:47.37]All my friends are gone.
[133:48.59]And I have to fight like 12 people behind this corner.
[134:30.41]Pick up all the pistols, have a monopoly on pistols.
[134:32.91]Alright, I have to think about this for a second here, because I don't think this is possible.
[134:42.54]What?
[134:42.72]Somebody pushed me out there.
[134:43.82]You idiot.
[134:45.84]Fucking idiot.
[134:46.74]What a dumbass.
[134:47.80]He pushed me out of cover and I got shot like four times.
[135:09.79]He's behind this thing.
[135:14.18]Where are you at?
[135:15.66]Where is he?
[135:20.06]I'm fucking bleeding.
[135:21.10]I gotta get the keybind for this too.
[135:33.25]Oh my lord.
[135:39.65]What's the keybind?
[135:40.35]I need to know this.
[135:44.43]always crouch low like uh what make this control so I can just tap it leaning lean right weapon one okay fire zoom grenade launcher next fire inventory active tasks quick bandage is what on Earth that's just that it's such a strange key binding um
[136:12.18]That's better.
[136:13.86]Drop is G, okay.
[136:15.16]So, bandage is mouse 4.
[136:22.44]Always crouch.
[136:25.62]Yeah, that's much better.
[136:27.24]Okay, I'm gonna try a different approach here.
[136:33.86]As I run into an anomaly accidentally.
[136:37.67]We're going around the back.
[136:39.87]Going in the front door does not seem to be the best possible way to do anything here.
[136:42.66]Okay, can I go in the back door?
[136:56.57]There has to be a way for me to get in the back, right?
[136:59.73]Right here, okay.
[137:09.96]The pig's got me cornered in the yard.
[137:11.92]Help me out, brothers.
[137:13.08]Okay.
[137:21.35]Where are they?
[137:28.81]God, this is not gonna fucking happen.
[137:37.43]Artifact.
[137:41.35]Whatever the hell this is.
[137:41.97]It's a mushroom.
[137:46.59]See?
[137:46.91]It's gotta be sneaky.
[137:51.71]Apparently.
[137:52.39]Okay, he's in here.
[137:59.22]Go up the ladder.
[138:03.88]Well, I don't even... Isn't the guy that I need to save or talk to over here?
[138:12.24]He's like in this building.
[138:18.38]He's like, I'm surrounded.
[138:19.26]Help me.
[138:26.08]They're like all.
[138:28.00]They're like all sitting in this building.
[138:38.75]I don't know the trajectory, how it works, but I did something.
[138:43.62]Weapons jammed?
[138:46.45]What are you fucking talking about?
[138:47.45]Weapon is jammed.
[138:52.65]Come here, you fucking asshole.
[139:12.26]Only one guy left.
[139:21.89]Okay.
[139:22.78]I win.
[139:23.04]Alright, we got a lot of shit to pick up.
[139:27.00]No pistols.
[139:28.64]As I pick up a fucking pistol.
[139:35.13]Get the fucking Japanese candy.
[139:36.33]Don't... I keep accidentally clicking on the pistols.
[139:39.37]Another werewolf's coming.
[139:53.78]I'm fucking, I'm crazy.
[139:56.90]I can't help it, I have to.
[140:00.60]Somebody give me first aid.
[140:02.04]Take this first aid.
[140:04.53]Okay.
[140:10.55]What?
[140:11.86]Do I have to pick up both of these guys?
[140:25.42]Did I just waste those two?
[140:34.90]Where did I save it?
[140:36.72]Where did I save that?
[140:37.44]What was the last save there?
[140:40.93]It was like, oh, help the stalkers.
[140:43.65]How far away did I just last save that?
[140:55.41]Whatever.
[140:56.79]Doesn't matter.
[140:57.29]Okay.
[140:57.59]Well, whatever then.
[141:00.49]Uh, guy up here.
[141:05.01]I'm too exhausted to walk.
[141:07.74]Just wait.
[141:08.48]I'll fix that.
[141:09.36]Don't worry.
[141:12.74]Huh?
[141:13.28]What did I just throw?
[141:13.88]What happened?
[141:14.52]Who was shooting?
[141:26.65]I'm too exhausted to walk.
[141:30.69]You can't fucking walk?
[141:32.13]Oh my god.
[141:33.01]I want to have this many fucking... Why am I getting hurt?
[141:43.23]What is happening?
[141:48.75]I'm still too exhausted apparently.
[141:57.15]Alright, well, he's in the building, I guess.
[142:00.69]And that hurts.
[142:01.47]Okay, follow... He's inside of here.
[142:03.67]Don't... I hope this doesn't kill me.
[142:04.83]Don't kill me.
[142:06.17]Okay, we're good.
[142:08.21]I... Damn it.
[142:17.72]Guys, help me out!
[142:26.02]There's one more fucking... Is it more than one?
[142:30.06]Yeah, there is.
[142:41.25]God fucking damn it, man.
[142:46.89]I've had enough.
[142:54.81]I've had enough.
[142:56.55]Get out of here.
[143:03.84]I've had enough.
[143:05.78]We're keeping this one.
[143:07.00]This one's special.
[143:15.36]Okay.
[143:17.08]Let's go into this building.
[143:21.46]He's radical.
[143:22.38]He's lost his mind.
[143:27.53]Kill the rookie and let the stalker be born.
[143:32.67]Okay, he's in there.
[143:41.66]There he is.
[143:42.10]There he is.
[143:44.94]There's the mole.
[143:47.52]Okay, help me.
[143:50.40]What are we doing with you?
[143:53.92]Come on, let's go.
[143:54.36]What do you need help with?
[144:00.81]Come on.
[144:02.77]Is somebody upstairs?
[144:03.55]Are you scared of somebody upstairs?
[144:05.35]Let daddy take care of it.
[144:07.23]Let daddy take care of it.
[144:09.47]We're gonna give those to daddy.
[144:10.87]We're gonna give those to daddy.
[144:16.13]Don't worry.
[144:16.49]Just let daddy take care of it.
[144:22.12]Stay there.
[144:25.07]What do I have?
[144:28.63]Two bullets.
[144:29.27]No, we need to use... Okay, I have a silenced pistol.
[144:35.64]How did I not see that yet?
[144:37.38]Don't ask me.
[144:37.98]I can't get in there.
[144:48.43]Don't worry, daddy's gonna fucking take care of everything.
[144:52.23]I promise.
[144:56.92]I promise.
[144:57.66]I didn't expect it.
[145:21.45]They blended in.
[145:31.55]I'm sorry, guys.
[145:32.87]I'm very sorry.
[145:35.23]But, like, they're not on the mini-map.
[145:37.29]They just, like, kind of walked forward.
[145:39.01]For the love of God.
[145:53.74]I'm, like, all shook up right now.
[146:04.24]That only took like fucking 30 shots.
[146:21.51]Okay, is this less accurate?
[146:22.83]Wow, I almost died.
[146:24.65]Is it less accurate with this on or something?
[146:26.19]I feel like some of those should be connecting.
[146:30.88]I'll be honest with you.
[146:53.59]Stand up.
[146:55.23]I thought that... Huh?
[147:04.00]Save mode.
[147:05.24]What?
[147:05.66]Oh, save mole.
[147:06.48]Okay.
[147:11.14]Okay, we're good.
[147:15.15]Alright, he's in here.
[147:19.37]There he is.
[147:20.43]Thank you, friend.
[147:21.05]You saved my life.
[147:21.99]This guy's not... That was too close.
[147:24.74]The grunts always carry their missions through.
[147:26.52]You have to get out of here before the task force arrives.
[147:29.86]Puppet mouth.
[147:30.42]Come on.
[147:31.42]I'll show you the way.
[147:32.40]This guy's got a mouthful of fucking cotton in his mouth.
[147:35.05]That guy was just at the dentist.
[147:43.52]No, uh... Turn your damn flashlight off if you're trying to be sneaky.
[147:50.69]Well, I don't know.
[147:52.95]We gotta get out of here.
[147:54.13]I gotta save them all.
[147:55.05]I just got like a Ghostbuster flash for some reason watching this guy run away.
[148:07.47]We going in here?
[148:12.78]Phew.
[148:13.80]It's quiet here.
[148:14.96]We can wait for the raid to finish.
[148:17.29]Seri told me what you're looking for.
[148:18.77]We're good.
[148:27.69]Phew.
[148:28.74]It's quiet here.
[148:29.82]We can wait for the raid to finish.
[148:32.20]Seri told me what you're looking for.
[148:37.92]Stop it!
[148:38.50]Stop.
[148:38.82]Just fucking stop it and play.
[148:40.64]God!
[148:43.61]Stop it!
[148:44.71]Oh my god!
[148:45.11]Okay, so be careful and good luck.
[148:46.35]I guess we're going in here.
[148:47.20]Down into the tunnel.
[148:48.62]Compulsive burn.
[148:49.14]Eliminate the bandits by the research institute.
[149:12.86]Why did I just have my... Okay, that was dumb.
[149:15.96]Task failed.
[149:16.78]Help the stalkers.
[149:17.76]What do you mean task failed?
[149:20.35]I just did it.
[149:23.21]I just did that.
[149:34.35]Now's the time for my flashlight to work.
[149:54.16]Do I have any bullets for this thing?
[149:56.32]Good.
[150:03.16]Okay, that guy died.
[150:06.36]Good for that.
[150:09.48]Come on.
[150:19.33]Well, I thought the barrel was a guy.
[150:21.15]I thought the barrel was an enemy.
[150:29.84]Huh?
[150:31.00]What was that explosion?
[150:43.11]Where are you?
[150:47.94]Can I get that fucking helmet?
[150:48.94]Holy shit.
[150:54.58]It's too dark down here.
[150:55.72]God damn it.
[151:13.35]I'm wearing one?
[151:25.12]Guns fucking jammed.
[151:34.30]Show your face come on you guys just what you want to sit back there the whole time would show you show up Fuck I'm so dead

[152:09.39]I'm out of pizzas.
[152:12.37]Oh god.
[152:12.65]I wasn't prepared for this shit Lord I only have one pizza.
[152:31.58]Well, this is bad.
[152:32.30]Oh
[152:36.00]This is real bad.
[152:36.94]I already took it.
[152:40.28]If it wasn't so dark, there's no one to like fucking hide.
[152:58.16]I'm just gonna fucking sit right here, man.
[153:02.32]What else can I do?
[153:09.85]Eventually someone's gonna have to come around the corner, right?
[153:12.19]Yeah.
[153:18.01]Nah, I'm fucking reloading it.
[153:19.11]Like... Holy shit.
[153:28.56]This is hard to even see anything.
[153:33.06]I could blow up that thing next to me, but I'll probably kill myself.
[153:35.59]I don't want to do that.
[153:42.41]Somebody shot a rocket launcher.
[153:44.71]And like, I got fucking bored and I looked over at chat.
[153:47.91]I'll add a bullet on that one.
[154:05.61]Jesus Christ.
[154:08.68]Phew.
[154:13.66]What else is even down here?
[154:14.54]I need to sell.
[154:27.43]Go back for your reward.
[154:29.01]Okay.
[154:30.65]Let's do that.
[154:34.29]Something in here, though?
[154:34.93]There's something right over here, right?
[154:36.97]Yeah.
[154:40.77]Bullets.
[154:41.97]Loud bullets.
[154:46.41]Uh, can I go back?
[154:47.99]Oh, no.
[154:49.15]No, no, no.
[154:50.17]Not electricity.
[154:52.11]Not another electricity thing.
[154:53.24]I don't want to do it.
[154:56.30]Keep going?
[154:58.14]I mean, wrong way.
[155:01.32]Keep going through it.
[155:02.18]Did it just say go back to get your reward?
[155:06.55]Like, go back where?
[155:11.49]Save mole.
[155:18.86]Go get your reward.
[155:24.10]So I just have to keep going.
[155:26.67]So just keep walking forward.
[155:31.07]Okay.
[155:32.81]I didn't... Yeah, I talked to the mole.
[155:36.37]I didn't talk to the mole?
[155:38.03]I thought that's what... Go back and talk to mole.
[155:43.73]What is all this shit?
[155:51.60]Okay, just don't step in the goo and everything will be fine.
[156:03.14]Where's the person I need to talk to, apparently?
[156:06.05]I don't see anybody.
[156:07.97]I just have to keep going.
[156:11.89]There's an invisible person right here.
[156:25.21]Why is there a predator down here?
[156:30.49]Is this what you guys wanted me to do?
[156:31.75]To go down to the predator zone?
[156:33.21]This is what you guys wanted, huh?
[156:37.29]He's injured.
[156:37.98]He's injured.
[156:47.16]Missed every shot point blank.
[156:48.40]I shot him right in the head.
[156:51.34]His reaction was lackluster.
[156:52.56]I just saw an invisible guy.
[156:53.99]What do you want me to do?
[157:02.05]Everyone thought I was going to scream or something.
[157:03.79]No, the guy was just staring at a wall and he was invisible.
[157:06.65]That could have been Otacon for all I know.
[157:14.52]That was scary.
[157:19.22]How can you see him if he's invisible?
[157:23.25]Alright, so now chat got their wish.
[157:26.63]We're going to go back upstairs and talk to them all.
[157:36.44]Who is this?
[157:36.88]Alright, let's go.
[157:49.09]Oh, that's one of the most infamous enemy types in the game.
[157:51.39]Usually he sneaks up behind you.
[157:52.75]Thank you, friend.
[157:53.95]You saved my life.
[157:54.35]That was too close.
[157:56.21]The Grunts always carry their missions through.
[157:58.03]I've got to get out of here before the task force arrives.
[158:01.13]You're welcome.
[158:01.55]Come on.
[158:02.89]I'll show you the way.
[158:04.89]See?
[158:05.27]You guys told me I'm going the right way.
[158:07.65]Why does he have his light on?
[158:09.57]He goes, follow me.
[158:10.59]He takes one step.
[158:11.49]This is where we're going.
[158:12.63]We need to go down there.
[158:15.05]Uh... Uh...
[158:35.10]Okay.
[158:36.78]That's fantastic.
[158:40.20]Okay.
[158:41.61]Info.
[158:41.99]How do I get into the basement?
[158:43.59]There we go.
[158:45.19]This is one of the many exits which lead you into the interconnected basements.
[158:47.87]Once you're in there, you're on your own.
[158:49.19]I don't have a map and the basement network is huge and confusing.
[158:51.69]Can't wait.
[158:53.90]Save mole.
[158:55.12]Get information.
[158:56.50]Thanks for the info.
[158:58.14]See you later.
[159:04.59]Steal the documents.
[159:13.85]Should I go do this?
[159:17.85]Now we have to go in the hole.
[159:19.75]But I'm not ready.
[159:21.83]I'm not ready to do this.
[159:42.57]Okay, where's the durable one?
[159:44.63]Okay, we're getting rid of this one.
[159:56.30]Okay, get rid of a couple of shotguns.
[160:08.04]Okay, we're good.
[160:10.06]We're now ready to succeed and lose immediately after going down there.
[160:18.34]AK special!
[160:28.95]Okay... Alright, I have bullets for this fucking thing.
[160:37.66]Finally, I drop all this bullshit.
[160:39.96]I know, and look, I'm sorry, it's just shiny things.
[160:42.40]Why can't I just, like, craft these together into some, like, scrap metal or something?
[160:47.09]Alright, I'm ready.
[160:48.39]I'm ready to go in.
[160:54.23]Here we go.
[161:00.71]ADHD.
[161:03.04]No, not ADHD.
[161:04.02]ADHD.
[161:07.56]It's called trying to figure out the solution.
[161:12.48]Don't want any of this.
[161:13.74]See, now I've gotten to the point where I've played for like a couple hours.
[161:16.03]I know... That scared the shit out of me.
[161:18.87]Okay.
[161:22.45]Nothing in there.
[161:22.95]Okay, so we just gotta go through here.
[161:31.47]So I have to fight the predator monster.
[161:40.10]That scared even the bloodsucker, didn't it?
[161:43.64]Shit.
[161:44.66]Shit!
[161:45.62]No, not this again.
[161:46.48]I don't want to do this again.
[161:47.43]I hate this.
[161:48.87]I hate this thing.
[161:50.13]I don't like this one.
[161:51.79]I don't like this one at all.
[161:53.09]I really don't.
[161:53.69]I hate it.
[161:55.13]I, like, get it, but I don't get it.
[161:56.47]I just don't get it.
[162:19.72]I'm not going that way.
[162:21.24]We're going back to the predator.
[162:30.30]Be careful.
[162:30.86]Be careful you don't run into the scary predator.
[162:34.23]I think I want the shotgun for the predator.
[162:37.31]Yeah.
[162:38.51]I feel like a couple of blasts to this fucking invisible shithead's face.
[162:42.03]He ain't gonna be creeping up on nobody from now on.
[162:44.13]You know what I mean?
[163:01.31]Come here.
[163:02.95]Come here.
[163:04.45]Come here.
[163:05.51]Where are you going?
[163:06.75]What are you doing?
[163:07.34]Just stop running around.
[163:08.64]Why not play in tag?
[163:09.90]I'm trying to kill you.
[163:10.84]For real.
[163:11.88]Where is he going?
[163:14.74]Is that a good guy?
[163:17.92]Thanks for the help, dude.
[163:18.80]I appreciate it.
[163:19.38]What does he have on him?
[163:21.94]Nothing?
[163:24.37]This is fucking... That's all bad military men.
[163:27.69]Good to know.
[163:32.58]Oh my fucking lord in heaven.
[163:43.03]You're it!
[163:43.99]Tag!
[163:44.43]You're it!
[163:48.79]Just no clip.
[163:53.75]I'm just fucking gonna wait for you, you dickhead.
[163:57.98]I don't know who you were shooting at, but that's my opportunity to get a free kill.
[164:03.37]And it just got all fucked up.
[164:05.71]It just got all fucked up.
[164:13.47]One of us is going to have to move and it's not going to be me.
[164:18.81]Am I shooting the wall?
[164:20.46]I think I might be shooting the wall, folks.
[164:31.15]You can't move him with his buddy.
[164:32.61]Okay.
[164:34.41]Alright.
[164:35.03]I've had enough.
[164:35.69]The one guy was tall.
[164:39.66]One guy was large.
[164:43.38]Oh my lord and fucking Satan.
[164:47.38]Fucking bring Satan back.
[164:52.30]I just got... Yeah, they double peeked me.
[165:01.02]This thing actually turns out it wasn't a good idea.
[165:06.19]How are you still alive?
[165:08.91]You green ninja turtle fuck.
[165:16.41]Got him.
[165:16.77]Alright, they tried to do the same damn thing again.
[165:18.51]I got him.
[165:18.83]That guy just scared the shit out of me.
[165:28.01]There's a hundred of them.
[165:31.02]There's so many people over here.
[165:33.00]Huh?
[165:35.04]I didn't expect there to be this many people.
[165:44.27]I don't have any grenades.
[165:45.15]Remember I used it?
[165:52.83]Oh lord.
[165:53.58]Okay, hold on.
[165:59.06]God damn it!
[166:03.77]Is that it?
[166:30.19]Look both ways before you cross the street.
[166:33.21]Okay, we're good.
[166:43.18]I picked up a fucking pistol.
[166:46.66]Grenade.
[166:52.44]Okay.
[166:54.79]We're good to go.
[166:57.29]Take all those pizzas.
[167:06.47]I have to like unload their guns.
[167:10.43]Oh my god you fucking like wall hacking aimbotting dick.
[167:17.37]Why do I have to shoot them like 12 times but I get fucking aimbotted and die in one fucking quarter of a second?
[167:26.57]Why?
[167:26.91]That's not fair.
[167:45.08]They're military, they have body armor on.
[167:46.64]I don't have any pizzas or anything.
[167:55.31]I gotta get, like, out of here.
[167:59.97]I gotta make a run for it, man.
[168:04.80]Okay, apparently... Apparently there's, like, something over here.
[168:09.94]Like, around this way.
[168:11.98]Give me something in these crates.
[168:14.14]Do something good.
[168:17.95]Take a look at my artifacts.
[168:18.93]I thought I couldn't use these.
[168:25.21]Causes increased cell growth.
[168:26.85]On the other hand, the newly formed cells are much more receptive to the effects of physical uranium.
[168:31.65]The effect doesn't show up very often.
[168:33.31]It's hard to call it rare.
[168:36.01]I don't understand how these work, though.
[168:38.03]You just put them in your inventory?
[168:43.20]And they just give you, like, a passive bonus or something?
[168:47.61]I'm gonna have to take a look at those in a minute.
[168:48.97]Like, I gotta just get, like, into a town.
[168:57.18]So what is here?
[168:57.64]Is this an artifact or something?
[168:58.60]What is this?
[169:01.94]Oh, no, that's the way up.
[169:03.56]Okay, hold on.
[169:03.84]Let me just make sure I didn't... I guess that's the way I gotta go.
[169:11.28]The upper right slots.
[169:12.38]Can I... Alright.
[169:13.20]Does it destroy them?
[169:13.94]Can I take them out?
[169:15.18]If I use them?
[169:16.12]Can I pull them back?
[169:18.20]Or is it one of those situations where you do it and that's it?
[169:21.40]And you can't ever take them out or something.
[169:29.96]Find the stash.
[169:33.68]You can wear them.
[169:34.94]They are permanent, someone just said, though.
[169:36.95]Oh.
[169:38.62]You can use them or un-use them as you please.
[169:40.00]Okay.
[169:42.92]Ooh, what's this?
[169:45.96]Uh, bandit jacket.
[169:46.76]I think this is what I already have on, right?
[169:50.29]Although, can I... How do... So, do these... These degrade over time, then, huh?
[170:01.15]Did I just do something wrong?
[170:02.68]Did I just fuck something up right there?
[170:04.92]Okay, here's the one I had on before.
[170:10.99]Armor has durability.
[170:15.26]This one's a little bit better.
[170:20.68]Okay.
[170:21.44]Cool.
[170:21.62]Do those sell?
[170:22.46]Oh, look at all these.
[170:23.38]Oh, boy.
[170:26.38]Secret stash.
[170:27.12]My ass.
[170:27.54]You got more important stuff here.
[170:29.16]Let me just unload these.
[170:33.25]What's this one?
[170:34.71]Accuracy handling this AK-72.
[170:35.65]What's this one?
[170:39.00]74-2U, 74-2, fast shooting AKM.
[170:46.69]Fuck, okay.
[170:47.83]That one is better handling.
[170:48.81]This one's more accurate and has better rate of fire.
[170:52.20]This one looks like it's better.
[171:03.31]He's the same ammo, too.
[171:04.36]That's good.
[171:07.08]Alright, let's break some stuff.
[171:08.82]Anything else in here I can, like, break?
[171:14.40]Well, that... I sure did get a lot out of there.
[171:16.44]Oh, and pizzas.
[171:18.78]Oh, thank God.
[171:20.24]Thank God the fucking delivery guy didn't make it.
[171:25.01]Oh, come on, crouch, man.
[171:28.19]Come on, give me this.
[171:31.85]Grenades...
[171:36.02]Fucking thank God.
[171:37.74]Thank God it's not DiGiorno.
[171:42.66]Anymore?
[171:42.96]Alright, so... Okay.
[171:51.19]I just got a lot of items.
[171:52.55]Let me just take a look at these for a second.
[171:56.45]Rupture... 400% health.
[172:01.37]So if I put this on, I can take this scab off, right?
[172:08.35]If I put the scab on, I can take the scab off.
[172:21.61]It's health regen.
[172:22.47]Nah, that's okay.
[172:26.74]I did it.
[172:31.16]Okay.
[172:33.04]So is there any point in not putting these on?
[172:36.76]I get rupture.
[172:38.78]What is rupture?
[172:42.43]I don't know if I want to put that one on.
[172:43.95]So it kills my resistances, but I get more health regen.
[172:49.77]Okay, so you can use it as a mini health thing to just recover a little bit of health and take it off.
[172:54.95]That's interesting.
[172:55.57]I like that.
[172:55.93]That's cool.
[172:57.91]This is where all the points are for the invasions.
[173:02.85]Alright.
[173:04.17]Time to go.
[173:06.43]Time to go.
[173:11.03]Some artifacts will just give you radiation?
[173:12.65]Alright.
[173:16.41]So I gotta get out of here now.
[173:21.31]Can I not open this door?
[173:22.21]This looks like a door that can be opened.
[173:24.51]I guess not.
[173:28.65]I don't like how dark it is.
[173:32.56]I have so much more ammo, though.
[173:37.02]Pipe?
[173:37.50]Pipe?
[173:37.72]What do you mean, pipe?
[173:38.84]Going to the pipe?
[173:39.50]Let's say this is sealed.
[173:44.08]Oh, you guys are talking about... I was... Alright.
[173:49.49]Yeah, yeah.
[173:50.01]I thought you were talking about that pipe.
[173:59.51]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[174:00.23]What?
[174:00.47]What?
[174:02.14]There's like a secret stash in here?
[174:06.45]What's a secret stash?
[174:10.59]Ooh!
[174:11.55]There really is like a gold bar in here!
[174:13.29]Find a way out.
[174:24.02]Nice.
[174:29.82]Nice!
[174:36.30]Nothing in there.
[174:38.02]Nothing in there.
[174:40.08]Alright, let's go.
[174:40.78]Get me out of here.
[174:43.30]Success.
[174:48.16]There's more behind the pipe.
[174:50.16]Where's my light?
[174:51.93]Where's my light?
[174:57.85]Wait, I gotta go back up.
[174:58.91]There's more on the... Hold on a second.
[175:01.69]Behind the small pipe.
[175:04.39]What the fuck?
[175:10.16]What are you talking about?
[175:11.88]Behind the small pipe there are boxes.
[175:14.80]What?
[175:15.28]Where?
[175:16.28]What are you referring to?
[175:25.07]This pipe?
[175:28.51]I already broke the boxes behind this pipe.
[175:34.79]Dude, I have literal tunnel vision right now.
[175:38.15]I can't see.
[175:40.46]Like, back here?
[175:41.18]This is what you're talking about?
[175:42.30]Oh, there's one box.
[175:46.64]And there was a fucking Diablo II breastplate.
[175:50.45]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[175:55.23]Okay, well, this... This thing looks pretty good.
[176:06.69]You're fucking welcome.
[176:07.93]Well, thank you.
[176:11.61]Get this off.
[176:13.13]Should I wear this or should I sell it?
[176:14.47]That's worth a lot of money.
[176:20.68]I guess I'm gonna put it on.
[176:23.10]Oh my fucking god.
[176:27.56]Is this like the best armor in the game or something?
[176:30.32]Jesus.
[176:33.92]Honestly, god, this is fucking ridiculous.
[176:36.77]Thank God I came back.
[176:38.07]Thank God I, like, decided to come back and, like, check out the room more, uh, more like a detective, you know?
[176:47.02]Man, you know, good thing I, like, I, good thing I was, like, checking it out and, like, make sure I check back and go back into the other room and check it.
[176:57.11]Getting backseated.
[176:58.17]I, look, I'm okay with getting backseated in this game.
[177:00.55]Listen, listen, listen, listen.
[177:02.63]I'm okay with getting backseated in Stalker.
[177:04.75]I am.
[177:05.95]Because, like, this game is just... It's very hard.
[177:08.85]We're playing on master difficulty.
[177:11.43]So, if there's something that I could use, or if I miss something, then that's alright.
[177:15.32]I'm okay.
[177:16.36]Just don't call me stupid.
[177:17.82]Don't make fun of me.
[177:18.78]And don't tell me to go read a fucking book.
[177:21.78]There was a guy in here earlier that was angry with me for not reading all the research for the whole game.
[177:28.50]And look, I didn't plan on playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
[177:31.96]tonight.
[177:32.44]We were just looking for a game to play.
[177:34.61]We were just looking to have a little bit of fun.
[177:36.47]I wasn't doing research on S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
[177:39.87]for the last 40 minutes.
[177:42.29]No, I just bought it and we turned the stream on.
[177:46.01]That guy really made me angry earlier.
[177:47.91]I don't even know who he was.
[177:50.55]He might even still be here.
[177:56.35]He might even still be in the chat.
[177:57.47]I don't even remember his name.
[177:59.67]But, you know, sometimes I get that.
[178:01.15]I get that.
[178:01.75]Like, people come in and they're like, wow, you fucking idiot.
[178:03.67]Like, how dare you play this game without, like, fucking sitting around and reading about it.
[178:07.95]How dare, like, chat, like, asks me to play this game.
[178:10.94]And I, like, you know, have five minutes to prepare the stream.
[178:14.04]How dare you?
[178:15.08]It's like, come on, give me a break, man.
[178:16.80]Like, I'm just trying to play a game.
[178:21.64]Mod him?
[178:21.94]Alright, he's gonna get modded.
[178:22.69]Okay.
[178:28.90]Well, that hurts my head.
[178:29.74]I'm getting mad again.
[178:35.54]No, I'm not getting angry.
[178:37.22]I just, like... You gotta give me a little bit of slack.
[178:40.16]Like, this is not a game that I'm used to, like, playing.
[178:45.95]And literally, like, 20 minutes before I started the stream, we were doing a straw poll as to what game I was gonna play tonight.
[178:53.47]And this is what it was.
[178:54.25]There's a guy inside of this room.
[179:01.93]Miser of... Who?
[179:04.49]Where are you?
[179:08.83]Dude, where... You dickheads are just under the... Alright, fine.
[179:22.30]I'll play that game.
[179:35.18]Didn't this happen in a movie?
[179:37.04]Why do I want to say Turner and Hooch?
[179:47.66]Didn't this happen within that fucking Tom Hanks movie with the dog?
[179:53.25]Am I hitting anybody?
[180:03.39]I thought that was a guy's mask.
[180:20.44]There's a guy still over there.
[180:21.48]Fuck you.
[180:21.98]Come on.
[180:25.03]There's one guy behind the fucking stupid thing.
[180:27.73]Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.
[180:29.29]Where are you?
[180:30.47]What are you...
[180:33.85]Alright, we're okay.
[180:36.33]Did I press N?
[180:37.03]Yes, I did.
[180:40.19]I'm gonna laugh at the funny glitch.
[180:41.53]Laugh at the funny glitch!
[180:42.37]It's wicked funny!
[180:47.66]Okay.
[180:48.46]I'll unload his shit.
[180:56.68]Okay.
[180:57.54]Keep it going.
[180:58.32]Just gotta go out that way.
[180:59.02]Let me just check.
[180:59.54]This guy might have had something good.
[181:02.98]Unload his shit.
[181:07.42]What about you?
[181:08.10]What about your person?
[181:08.94]What was on your person?
[181:17.12]Okay.
[181:17.72]Was anything on that guy's person?
[181:20.53]Why did I think that was a good idea?
[181:28.87]We need to conserve.
[181:30.59]And I need to get rid of this.
[181:34.61]There's no purpose for me to own this right now.
[181:36.33]I have, like, two better versions of that gun.
[181:42.72]Okay.
[181:44.16]I'm trying to skip content here.
[181:45.72]Don't hurt me.
[181:46.16]Of course, I'm bleeding.
[181:50.08]Fucking dummy.
[181:50.75]Alright, let's go.
[182:02.80]Oh shit.
[182:03.22]Rads.
[182:06.05]Rads, man!
[182:08.99]Was that a cigarette?
[182:13.73]Was that a burnt cigar?
[182:15.49]This is a melted person.
[182:18.02]I thought that was a boot.
[182:18.92]I thought that was literally a guy that was dipped in the Toon Goo from Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
[182:37.11]This is not a box?
[182:38.85]Apparently not.
[182:41.94]Alright, get back.
[182:42.66]Let's go.
[182:46.38]Oh, huh?
[182:47.50]Huh?
[182:49.10]Huh?
[182:50.50]Turn the light off.
[182:52.36]My ears!
[182:52.83]Ow, my ears!
[182:54.51]What happened to me?
[182:55.99]Why am I getting... What is this guy... Ow, my fucking ears!
[183:00.55]Ow!
[183:01.81]Why?
[183:02.23]Why do you have to be that loud?
[183:03.77]Why?
[183:04.31]God!
[183:06.24]Ow!
[183:12.29]That actually really hurt.
[183:23.14]Who's shooting at me?
[183:25.88]I don't deserve this.
[183:26.92]Where am I?
[183:27.66]Okay, I'm inside of the complex now, right?
[183:32.77]Okay, so now I gotta go here and go to the boogeyman.
[183:35.05]Steal the documents.
[183:43.51]How the fuck am I gonna get in there?
[183:46.98]I have a silenced gun, right?
[183:48.60]Put on the silenced.
[183:49.46]Put on the silenced PP7.
[183:50.60]Okay, everything is silenced.
[183:58.12]Let's do this.
[183:58.64]Let's do this smart.
[183:59.46]Let's do this right.

[184:08.37]Nope.

[184:43.56]Nothing else matters.
[184:47.03]Just go get the audio file that keeps playing.
[184:50.07]That keeps resetting.
[185:04.35]I check every set.
[185:05.55]Like, I did the right thing.
[185:07.29]I did the right thing.
[185:09.45]And I'm getting shot from behind now.
[185:15.39]God damn it, man.
[185:16.35]You do the right thing.
[185:17.17]It doesn't even matter.
[185:30.48]Oh, shit.
[185:33.98]Well, boys and girls, sometimes you just need... Sometimes you gotta just fucking sprint.
[185:49.22]Sometimes you gotta sprint.
[185:51.64]And fuck everything else.
[186:08.33]Documents.
[186:10.45]Documents.
[186:11.27]Nope, those are just burnt cigarettes.
[186:13.43]Documents.
[186:15.93]Search the stash.
[186:16.66]There's nothing in here.
[186:18.39]What kind of stash is this?
[186:21.85]Where are the documents?
[186:28.23]Where's all your stuff?
[186:31.32]Break!
[186:31.56]How do I smash this?
[186:37.18]Oh my god.
[186:38.84]It's like down a level or something.
[186:44.00]Oh fuck.
[186:48.85]It's on the bottom floor.
[186:52.15]You gonna do this to me?
[186:53.71]After all I've done for you, game?
[186:58.94]After all I've done?
[187:01.52]After all we've been through?
[187:03.68]You gonna give me this shit?
[187:08.76]This is not a document.
[187:10.29]There's no document here.
[187:12.23]Where's this document?
[187:41.53]That guy shot at that.
[187:45.35]You guys saw that.
[187:46.21]That guy was shooting a clip into that right next to it.
[187:51.33]That was so unnecessary.
[187:52.67]Why did he do that to himself?
[187:55.06]There's no documents!
[188:06.22]Found it.
[188:07.04]Ooh!
[188:15.36]What is with you?
[188:15.96]A fucking soup?
[188:16.64]I don't have any bandages left.
[188:18.94]I gotta go fucking... I gotta murder this guy and then take his bandages now.
[188:21.61]Quickly.
[188:22.55]I gotta get the courage.
[188:23.23]Courage.
[188:23.61]How do I get courage?
[188:24.91]Courage.
[188:47.46]What the fuck was that?
[188:49.70]Don't even question it, just keep moving.
[188:55.89]This guy was trying to fight this guy.
[189:06.70]They're near.
[189:15.18]Guys, guys, guys.
[189:19.08]I want you to slow-mo that.
[189:20.54]Go back and slow-motion that whole fucking sequence.
[189:23.94]Go do it.
[189:24.36]Go slow-mo that sequence.
[189:26.24]Tell me what I did wrong.
[189:28.50]I did something wrong there, apparently.
[189:29.94]I didn't hit him.
[189:31.26]Somehow.
[189:33.75]The last shot was to the right of his head.
[189:35.37]I don't even give you fucking position away like that again.
[189:53.71]Honest to God.
[189:54.21]It's like these guys are immune to damage.
[189:59.31]Come on now.
[190:03.54]No, that's not a real crate.
[190:04.66]It's a fake one.
[190:07.06]Alright, here's the documents.
[190:08.28]Found them.
[190:10.47]Now I gotta get out of here.
[190:12.81]I have to actually escape this madness?
[190:14.07]No, I can't... Get out of here!
[190:15.99]Trying to press 1, not tilde.
[190:46.62]No clip.
[190:49.56]F on the crate?
[190:51.86]What do you mean, F on the crate?
[190:59.06]Fucking tilde key.
[191:04.79]Guy in the... Guy in the bushes.
[191:06.73]Got the guy in the head three times.
[191:15.67]Where was the guy's protection on his head?
[191:17.27]There, guys.
[191:32.86]Blue... I gotta get the blue box?
[191:34.87]I'd like... Go get the blue box!
[191:40.79]Everyone is yelling at me now.
[191:42.07]Like, I...
[191:44.52]This box right here, you're saying?
[191:48.04]There's nothing in the box!
[191:51.86]No, we're not... There's nothing in that box, guys!
[192:02.96]You... You fucking asshole!
[192:06.11]You assholes, there's nothing in there!
[192:09.67]You... You butt heads!
[192:13.41]I have to get out of here.
[192:14.71]Like, for real.
[192:20.11]Is that guy... They're aiming up here.
[192:31.17]I don't... Sometimes.
[192:36.83]I just don't understand this game sometimes.
[192:44.92]Fuck, I just- I'm gonna die again.
[192:57.79]Don't shoot it.
[193:01.05]Don't- I'll shoot it.
[193:02.11]Oh my god.
[193:14.41]Get the fuck out of here.
[193:18.88]Guys, they're sitting in the fucking bush!
[193:34.55]Why do they have to make this shit so fucking impossible?
[193:40.45]That's not the way.
[193:41.03]I can't go that way.
[193:42.19]It's not possible to go out that fucking front door.
[193:45.21]There's something else I have to do.
[193:59.45]Shut up.
[194:00.61]Shut this thing up.
[194:02.48]Finally.
[194:03.24]I completed the mission.
[194:04.90]I shut the thing off.
[194:07.94]Alright, hold on.
[194:11.70]Alright, so what's the correct way to leave?
[194:23.19]Not this way.
[194:24.61]Okay.
[194:28.75]Is this a ladder?
[194:32.65]I knew it was gonna happen.
[194:33.85]I don't care.
[194:34.61]Let's go.
[194:38.81]Like, I knew that was gonna happen.
[194:50.54]Come here, you fucking dick.
[195:02.33]God damn it.
[195:04.29]God damn it, man.
[195:07.82]Go.
[195:08.64]Get me out.
[195:10.24]But there's so many people!
[195:12.10]There's so many... There's...
[195:25.70]Just run out.
[195:27.70]Just run out, you say?
[195:28.76]I can't just run out.
[195:31.56]Just run out?
[195:35.82]Is there like a back entrance?
[195:38.03]There is.
[195:38.35]I made it.
[195:43.21]Get off me!
[196:13.34]Let's say... God.
[196:20.12]Just like... Okay.
[196:24.72]Just slide easy, easy.
[196:26.98]It's okay.
[196:28.73]Same deal, only watch out for the fucking anomaly.
[196:31.55]Where is it?
[196:32.25]It's like out here somewhere.
[196:34.03]There it is.
[196:34.47]Okay.
[196:37.19]Just go over here.
[196:39.11]Okay, I'm fine.
[196:40.35]Just avoid that.
[196:44.06]Jesus Christ.
[196:47.94]Okay.
[196:48.44]Get me out of here.
[196:49.78]Wait, what is over here?
[196:50.52]There's like something over here in the side.
[196:54.29]What is this?
[196:54.77]There's like a box over here.
[197:00.09]Search the stash.
[197:01.35]Okay, this... I got it.
[197:03.39]Whatever it was, I got it.
[197:08.72]My God.
[197:11.46]Just the fact that, like, it did... That's the first time I've ever seen somebody explode in this game.
[197:16.41]Like, ripped the fuck apart.
[197:19.57]Oh, that was fucking funny.
[197:21.93]Just spinning me around and then just exploding me.
[197:24.27]And there's another anomaly over there.
[197:25.74]Alright, where am I heading?
[197:28.06]I gotta be careful.
[197:31.68]Okay, so... I need to go, like, over here, right?
[197:36.77]To the garbage!
[197:39.10]Right?
[197:39.26]I don't even remember what the fuck I'm supposed to do.
[197:41.56]I gotta go to, like, the barber.
[197:42.50]I gotta go back.
[197:42.92]Okay.
[197:43.12]I know where I'm going.
[197:45.82]Let's go this way.
[197:48.42]Flashlight.
[197:48.86]My flashlight.
[197:49.32]Oh, fuck.
[197:52.60]I got a save.
[197:53.30]I saved it.
[197:53.74]Ooh.
[198:02.55]There's an anomaly.
[198:04.85]Wait, is that an artifact or is that an anomaly?
[198:06.77]I don't remember.
[198:07.41]I think it's an artifact.
[198:08.85]It is.
[198:19.01]What is he aiming at?
[198:19.85]I think he was looking for me.
[198:22.41]Pretty sure he had his sights out trying to find me.
[198:36.57]Well, you didn't find me, dude.
[198:43.76]There's a backstab.
[198:44.48]And there's another artifact.
[198:49.24]Ooh!
[198:50.92]Nice.
[198:57.03]Alright, we're almost ready to sell stuff for the first time in the entire game.
[199:08.20]What's with all these random artifact things lying around?
[199:09.97]It looks like a gold nugget.
[199:17.71]Okay.
[199:18.57]So... This way.
[199:26.26]Be careful.
[199:27.12]Light.
[199:27.40]Turn the light off.
[199:33.75]No.
[199:34.11]I'm not going to attack these guys.
[199:35.47]No reason to.
[199:41.84]The things lying around are the worst.
[199:45.76]They're like the bad ones.
[199:46.50]Well, that's good to know.
[199:48.16]There are a lot of artifacts.
[199:50.99]You get a ton of cash if you sell them.
[199:52.63]That's good.
[199:54.41]I will make sure to do that.
[200:05.87]You can actually detect them with a detector.
[200:07.80]That's kind of cool.
[200:10.64]Protect the stalker's camp with the garbage from bandits.
[200:15.01]Are you sure I need to do that?
[200:23.05]Okay.
[200:26.91]I haven't been spotted, have I?
[200:28.93]Apparently I have.
[200:41.43]I'm not gonna sit in the open.
[200:42.37]Did that guy just fall into the fucking ground?
[200:53.28]Oh no.
[201:15.20]I'm sorry, guys.
[201:16.26]You're getting the jump.
[201:17.98]I'm getting jump scared by these people.
[201:28.98]I'm so sorry.
[201:29.90]I wish I didn't scream and stuff like that, but that was terrible.
[201:34.94]I'm so fucking sorry.
[201:42.74]That was like a next level of war.
[201:50.46]That was a next level scream and I just hurt a bunch of people and I'm sorry I've hurt you.
[202:06.83]Not loud enough to be honest.
[202:10.13]It was fucking loud.
[202:11.63]I could feel that one.
[202:18.26]I felt that one in my bones, guys.
[202:30.17]The gunplay in this game is actually fun because it feels like you have to actually aim the gun and get them in the right spot.
[202:40.16]I hear something.
[202:41.16]I hear something.
[202:43.59]What do I hear?
[202:44.25]I hear something.
[202:57.75]One more.
[203:03.61]Shit, I'm bleeding.
[203:06.39]At least I was.
[203:07.05]What?
[203:15.23]God damn it, bro!
[203:16.85]Come on, bro!
[203:17.43]Come on, bro!
[203:19.43]Come on, bro!
[203:21.15]Come on, bro!
[203:32.18]Bro.
[203:33.60]Bro.
[203:35.48]I could have said a lot of horrible things there.
[203:42.60]Good thing bro is the only thing that came out and not like butthead or like bastard or like bitch.
[203:50.34]Those are a no-no.
[203:53.90]Those are a no-no.
[204:00.27]What did I just... What was that?
[204:13.87]Hope nobody's shooting at me.
[204:19.20]I hear pigs now.
[204:22.34]You guys hear that fucking pig?
[204:23.42]Okay.
[204:35.03]I have some.
[204:35.33]I have way too much stuff.
[204:40.64]I still can't... There we go.
[204:44.16]In the front door.
[204:44.86]Increase the FOV.
[204:50.96]I think it's at 90.
[204:53.12]There's no slider, but I'm pretty sure the default FOV is 90.
[204:55.55]At least that's what my understanding is.
[205:08.40]Those are guys on my team.
[205:12.44]God damn it.
[205:14.06]Did I really just do that?
[205:16.30]Well, why were they aiming at me?
[205:19.88]No, okay, they didn't know it was me.
[205:23.37]Hey, see?
[205:27.37]Don't aim that shit at me, dude.
[205:29.19]Okay, well, what's... I have to reload the save?
[205:37.37]Why?
[205:44.86]Wait, you guys are calling me an idiot.
[205:46.36]Like, an idiot.
[205:48.47]The guy creeped up and was aiming his gun at me.
[205:55.53]Am I missing something?
[205:56.19]What's, like, even down here?
[206:07.03]Is somebody hiding shit in their bed?
[206:14.25]Oh, well.
[206:19.16]It's like drugs in his mattress.
[206:22.12]I'm still alive?
[206:22.98]Yeah, I've only been streaming for like three and a half hours.
[206:28.59]Open the cupboard.
[206:29.23]I don't think there's anything I can do.
[206:34.93]Oh, I guess there is.
[206:37.78]And there was a stone blood.
[206:41.28]Cool.
[206:46.09]Alright, I've been streaming for like three and a half hours.
[206:47.83]Whoa, wait a minute.
[206:50.27]More stuff.
[206:51.13]Wait.
[206:51.51]Are they gonna... They don't care about that, right?
[206:59.75]Okay, I don't think they care.
[207:00.99]Uh, let me... Speaking of... Let's do... Where's the 400% one?
[207:02.63]There it is.
[207:02.87]I want health.
[207:04.75]Whoa!
[207:04.85]Oh.
[207:15.51]Bad guy.
[207:15.97]Alright, I think I just gotta keep going, right?
[207:20.63]This is you.
[207:22.66]This is your brain on drugs.
[207:32.66]Am I missing something with this?
[207:39.74]Except people are still shooting.
[207:45.96]So, like, there's just one guy hanging out somewhere.
[207:47.80]Is that a... Where's the one dude?
[207:55.12]Really?
[207:56.77]Like, come on.
[207:58.19]Like, that's it?
[207:59.39]One fucking idiot that's hanging out?
[208:02.71]Come back for the reward.
[208:04.57]Come back where?
[208:11.77]Prisoner... What is this next one?
[208:14.45]Kill the bandits at the car park.
[208:16.27]Some of these just stay on there, huh?
[208:20.65]The health items are useless?
[208:25.63]Reward time.
[208:28.89]Who's gonna... Who gives me the reward?
[208:31.19]Okay.
[208:37.98]Thanks for the help.
[208:38.46]Things are pretty hairy.
[208:39.17]What are you doing here?
[208:39.75]I'm looking for information.
[208:42.41]Okay.
[208:43.81]$2,500.
[208:44.65]Thanks for the info.
[208:47.67]It's that easy.
[208:50.44]So we're going up north.
[208:54.04]And this time I'm allowed to go up north now, right?
[208:57.92]From my understanding.
[208:59.56]No, I'm not doing a 24-hour stream.
[209:06.08]Bang and left.
[209:15.38]Am I drinking down east tonight?
[209:16.54]No, I'm not.
[209:18.08]I am not drinking anything right now.
[209:20.48]I had a coffee earlier and I'm just chilling.
[209:24.15]Let's get this off.
[209:30.03]When is the stream going to end?
[209:31.79]Maybe another hour or so.
[209:32.63]Something like that.
[209:38.69]Are there subtitles?
[209:39.47]I don't think so.
[209:43.59]Three hour stream?
[209:44.41]No, I was planning on going for about five hours.
[209:48.99]And then, um, I might... This game's fun.
[209:54.64]I'm like, actually, I'm enjoying this game.
[209:56.26]Okay.
[210:03.46]Monsters.
[210:09.88]I think I'll play it again.
[210:10.62]Are these the monsters that are coming in?
[210:16.30]I think it is, right?
[210:17.11]Those are the monsters.
[210:29.79]I couldn't even get there in time.
[210:31.81]You're making fun of me and I like fucking was on the road.
[210:37.23]Do I need to redo this?
[210:42.24]We're not going to give you any gratitude.
[210:49.46]Whatever.
[210:54.94]Oh, yeah?
[210:57.20]Well, I have business with the barkeep.
[211:01.02]Yep.
[211:02.16]Yeah, the barkeep told us about you.
[211:03.38]You can pass.
[211:04.08]Say hi for the barkeep from me when you see him.
[211:07.36]Oh, and don't forget, there are lots of anomalies on the way, so pick up.
[211:10.44]That's fine.
[211:10.98]I can't wait.
[211:13.85]Thanks a lot.
[211:36.48]Fuck you guys.
[211:40.28]Alright, let's move.
[211:41.59]Watch out for the anomalies.
[211:42.61]They're everywhere.
[211:44.93]I see one right there.
[211:45.85]I see one over there.
[211:52.32]Yep.
[211:53.22]Made it out.
[211:54.38]Foo-hoo.
[211:54.92]Hey.
[211:55.38]Foo-hoo.
[211:59.61]What difficulty is this on?
[212:00.55]This is on Master.
[212:03.21]And there is something in this car.
[212:11.11]In the trunk?
[212:17.01]Uh, where is this stash that's apparently in here?
[212:36.47]Making a glove box?
[212:37.43]I feel like this is the only place where it could be.
[212:44.14]Where is it?
[212:52.64]Underneath a car?
[212:55.50]Crouching the open door.
[212:56.50]That's what I'm doing, isn't it?
[213:05.36]Okay.
[213:06.28]Well, there we go.
[213:09.26]That's a lot of free shit.
[213:12.06]I couldn't even see that.
[213:16.62]Why does the stab sound like a Half-Life 2 gun?
[213:19.97]Because this game is 10 years old.
[213:22.19]And I'm sure that everybody used the same stock shit when they were making video games.
[213:26.89]I have 400 fucking bullets.
[213:29.84]I desperately need to sell.
[213:35.30]Anything else?
[213:35.78]Anything in the back of your van?
[213:41.87]Give me in here.
[213:42.31]It's like boxes in here.
[213:46.49]I'm not too exhausted.
[213:47.83]Just... Okay, I'm about... Let's go.
[213:51.35]Like, just... Just please.
[213:53.19]Please, God.
[213:58.23]There we go.
[214:04.63]Nothing.
[214:07.17]Well, that sure wasn't worth coming in here for.
[214:09.01]I can hear the desperation in your voice.
[214:14.07]It's... I'm desperate, Etalyx.
[214:19.20]Hey Taliesin, welcome.
[214:19.94]We're playing Stalker.
[214:20.84]Call of Pripyat.
[214:23.50]Just kidding.
[214:24.02]We're playing the older one.
[214:26.56]How much shit do I have?
[214:27.38]I don't want to aggro any dogs.
[214:31.90]No dog aggro.
[214:34.66]Don't do it.
[214:35.10]Fuck.
[214:41.08]You got a fucking mangy dog problem.
[214:43.30]Look, the dogs are like fucking each other.
[214:44.84]Oh my god.
[215:08.40]That's a lot of dogs.
[215:10.84]That's a lot of animals.
[215:19.36]Don't pick up another fucking pistol.
[215:21.30]Drop it.
[215:26.87]I'm not going to fuck it up.
[215:27.95]There's too many.
[215:30.32]Here they all come.
[215:31.20]Oh my god, dude.
[215:33.12]No, just fight each other.
[215:34.64]This one regular dog and then there's a bunch of fucking animals.
[215:40.02]I can't even run.
[215:41.86]Where are they all going?
[215:44.71]I don't give a fuck.
[215:48.75]Okay, seriously, just get the fuck away from me.
[215:53.69]I'll use it if I have to.
[215:59.53]Are they all just sitting over here?
[216:01.37]Hold on.
[216:05.61]They're all looking at the bird.
[216:06.95]Oh shit.
[216:20.26]Okay.
[216:20.98]They're eating each other.
[216:25.53]Alright, I just, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[216:27.43]Done, we're done, we're going in the fucking door.
[216:30.23]Fuck the dogs.
[216:31.47]Fuck it all.
[216:37.95]Fuck it.
[216:39.66]You fucking mangy mutts.
[216:44.46]Shit.
[216:45.94]No, what do I do?
[216:48.82]How do I not get killed by the dogs?
[216:51.38]There's like 20 of them.
[217:02.17]Okay, we're good.
[217:07.17]Almost there.
[217:09.71]Okay, go.
[217:13.01]Okay, we made it.
[217:14.75]You guys have a real fucked up dog problem.
[217:20.32]Look at this mess.
[217:25.50]Get outta here.
[217:28.03]Alright, is this a named person?
[217:30.87]There's a massacre on the outpost.
[217:32.83]That's just a wave of mutants.
[217:34.23]Okay.
[217:37.54]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[217:38.24]Let me just get this done first.
[217:39.32]Alright, where am I?
[217:44.00]I need to go to the bar.
[217:45.66]The bar is over here.
[217:49.58]Come back for the reward.
[217:50.60]I gotta bang a left and go in here.
[217:53.26]Alright.
[217:59.13]Just go.
[218:01.68]Do I think I'll ever play this game again?
[218:02.96]I don't know.
[218:04.70]Yeah, I kind of want to.
[218:07.48]I have a plan for next week.
[218:08.68]There's like a bunch of games I'm playing next week.
[218:12.15]But... I'm interested.
[218:15.27]I'm still interested.
[218:16.33]It's still been enough fun for me to care.
[218:17.61]What?
[218:25.98]Get out of here.
[218:26.54]I have business here.
[218:27.90]I'm just overburdened.
[218:30.58]I need to get to the fucking bar.
[218:31.90]Go.
[218:33.79]I have to stand still.
[218:42.37]Oh, let's go to the Gap.
[218:43.73]Get some shitty t-shirts and bad jeans.
[218:53.27]Okay, go.
[218:56.07]Is this the bar?
[218:58.35]This doesn't look like a bar.
[219:00.11]This looks like a jail.
[219:01.17]Alright, I guess this is a bar.
[219:06.26]Okay, we're at the bar.
[219:07.06]We made it.
[219:07.42]I stole and I can't move.
[219:23.54]I just tried to steal from this guy and like, I fucking can't move.
[219:33.84]What do I put down?
[219:34.68]How about one of the seven shotguns?
[219:38.74]Here.
[219:40.27]Take one of... Take a... Where'd they all go?
[219:43.15]What happened to them all?
[219:47.15]I had seven shotguns.
[219:48.57]Where'd they all go?
[219:50.65]Where are my shotguns?
[220:01.09]Alright.
[220:02.85]Let's get some sales.
[220:05.21]Oh, sell.
[220:06.95]Sell.
[220:08.22]Here are the documents.
[220:09.40]The game did you a fucking favor.
[220:11.18]That's so funny.
[220:12.18]Okay, got $5,000.
[220:12.64]Okay.
[220:30.68]But we're still missing the info we need to get a full picture.
[220:35.31]Only a designated XA-2 is mentioned, and its description matches the abandoned underground vaults in the Dark Valley.
[220:43.75]Looks like you'll have to go there and get the info that we need.
[220:47.39]The lab is closed, and you'll need two electronic keys to get inside.
[220:53.09]I'll give you one, but you'll have to get the other one from the Boar in the Dark Valley.
[221:00.98]Tell me more!
[221:05.48]Okay, I'll try!
[221:06.30]Okay, all you do is acquire the second key to the lab, X-18.
[221:11.86]Get inside and retrieve the second bitch of documents.
[221:14.60]Don't forget to get yourself a bitch.
[221:16.30]And a protective bitch.
[221:17.52]Oh, you don't have a chance in hell of getting to that bitch!
[221:19.70]So what will you do, bitch?
[221:22.00]See ya!
[221:23.54]No, wait, what do I... There we go.
[221:24.98]Pfft.
[221:31.50]What?
[221:33.42]Okay, yes.
[221:34.62]I finally can sell.
[221:37.04]Minus 20.
[221:38.24]Minus 20, that wasn't... I thought that's what it said.
[221:40.84]Watch your profanity.
[221:48.71]Alright.
[221:50.33]Look at all this stuff.
[221:51.33]How much money does he have?
[221:58.09]Son of a gun.
[222:00.31]Alright, so I don't need these bandit jackets anymore.
[222:02.79]I have, like, the best thing in the game.
[222:04.73]1,500.
[222:04.77]Holy shit.
[222:07.45]I have two stalker suits?
[222:10.57]Where did I get the other one?
[222:16.61]Alright.
[222:17.27]What about some of these guns?
[222:18.69]Where are my... Eight.
[222:19.41]Okay.
[222:19.99]Do you want six shotguns?
[222:24.79]What?
[222:29.12]Keep the one that has more durability.
[222:33.08]Holy shit, this is a lot.
[222:35.86]I'm gonna keep this one.
[222:36.50]This one has more durability.
[222:38.45]Oh, he gave me one.
[222:39.31]Okay.
[222:42.09]Alright.
[222:48.39]Get that swanky gun.
[222:49.33]Lookit, this thing is fucking swanky.
[222:52.47]What is this?
[222:53.08]Merc suit.
[222:56.94]Keep them both?
[223:00.89]So these things are hard to come by, I'm assuming then, huh?
[223:05.21]Alright, interesting.
[223:07.71]Uh, so... This thing, these things are worthless.
[223:14.81]I have so much of this.
[223:16.95]Nine... Let's sell, like, can I just, like, easily just get it in there without having to drag this shit?
[223:27.49]Just sell these shitty artifacts.
[223:41.42]Okay, that's easier.
[223:42.08]Let's get this down to, like, 160.
[223:45.08]And sell, like, a couple of sausages.
[223:48.73]No, no, I want those.
[223:49.91]Fuck you, these are mine.
[223:51.93]You're not taking these.
[223:53.39]Uh, dog tail!
[223:55.69]They're worthless, apparently.
[223:59.33]I have pizza.
[224:02.10]So, which... This one's good.
[224:04.54]This one's good.
[224:06.39]These are both, like, the same exact thing.
[224:08.63]Except this one's just better.
[224:09.95]So, Stoneblood is going away.
[224:15.13]Uh, Fish Head.
[224:17.39]An Artifact and Rupture.
[224:18.89]Like, this thing sucks.
[224:21.25]This thing sucks, too.
[224:23.84]This sucks.
[224:24.82]Uh, Bulletproof Cap.
[224:27.40]Should I keep these?
[224:28.58]Okay.
[224:37.39]Apparently, these ones are better.
[224:41.19]Keep the stoneblood.
[224:44.34]Okay.
[224:45.34]So, all the things that are in here are worthless, right?
[224:49.54]Sell the jellyfish?
[224:52.76]Yeah, it seems worthless.
[224:56.68]Okay.
[224:59.44]Pistol, whatever.
[225:00.26]Okay, what about this viper?
[225:09.39]I'm going to get 13,000.
[225:12.39]I do need more pizzas.
[225:17.71]How much better are these ones?
[225:18.65]This is an Obokon.
[225:22.29]This thing is... Why is this thing any... This thing sucks.
[225:28.29]I mean, I guess... Does it have more damage?
[225:30.49]I guess it has a little bit more damage, but the handling is terrible.
[225:34.88]The accuracy is better on both of these.
[225:38.12]Is that damage that big of a deal?
[225:39.54]I can say, I'll hold on to this one.
[225:49.59]Let's get rid of one.
[225:50.61]I have six shotguns.
[225:51.76]No, I don't.
[225:52.16]Okay, I have six of these.
[225:56.32]Wait, this is a shotgun?
[225:57.34]No, it's not.
[225:58.42]Okay.
[226:03.34]Alright, what about this?
[226:04.10]Like, Noiseless Pistol, PBS-1.
[226:05.64]What's the difference between these two?
[226:09.96]Where are my currently equipped items?
[226:11.18]Let me just trade these first.
[226:13.47]Let's get rid of that, so I know I'm getting rid of that dumb shit.
[226:20.61]PB-1S.
[226:22.15]It's the same thing, except this one, mine's like, has less durability.
[226:25.21]This one's only 600, though.
[226:25.83]Okay.
[226:34.45]I kind of want to just buy one.
[226:37.90]They're just shit.
[226:38.74]Okay.
[226:40.12]Well, we need some pizzas, that's for sure.
[226:41.54]You only have one pizza.
[226:44.74]That's fucking stupid.
[226:47.68]Okay.
[226:54.45]That's all this guy has.
[226:55.23]Let me see.
[226:55.87]Trade.
[226:56.27]He's got...
[227:03.03]Walker P90M.
[227:04.79]P98.
[227:07.23]Accuracy damage.
[227:09.89]This thing's... Oh, this is a better pistol.
[227:11.37]I want this.
[227:13.29]You can take my shitty pistol.
[227:17.28]I want that.
[227:17.72]Okay, this is... I want this ammo.
[227:27.12]Should I buy just all of his fucking ammo?
[227:35.61]No, I don't want that.
[227:39.07]9mm?
[227:39.43]Oh, wait a minute.
[227:40.07]It's different.
[227:41.67]The bullets are different.
[227:47.57]Um... I don't know what even uses what.
[227:52.44]This is different fucking ammo.
[228:07.93]Alright, I'm gonna stay with that for now.
[228:15.51]I kinda wanna get rid of one of these.
[228:16.55]Where's the one that's silenced?
[228:20.17]I'm gonna get rid of this.
[228:26.30]So, one of my six... No, I'm gonna... No.
[228:36.64]That's it.
[228:37.08]We're done.
[228:39.27]We're done.
[228:40.09]Let's equip this pistol.
[228:42.09]So that's the new pistol.
[228:53.20]Since you should.
[228:54.72]I'm currently wearing the stalker suit.
[228:56.54]Okay.
[228:56.76]Alright.
[228:57.10]Nobody cares.
[228:57.92]This is perfect.
[228:58.90]I love how you can steal whatever you want.
[229:01.34]No one even cares.
[229:02.98]It's just free stuff.
[229:03.68]Alright.
[229:04.54]Good.
[229:17.53]No.
[229:19.97]What is this?
[229:25.54]Can I put shit in here and will it stay in here?
[229:27.74]Or is these guys going to take this?
[229:28.78]This seems like a really bad spot for people to have it.
[229:32.38]Like, I can come back in here.
[229:33.36]No one's going to take this, right?
[229:34.48]Okay.
[229:34.96]Well, let's store that.
[229:47.67]At least, I don't even know what the fuck this stuff does.
[229:50.19]Dog tails?
[229:51.39]Come here.
[229:52.61]I've always got something interesting for people like you.
[229:55.35]That was one of my sick shots, guys.
[229:56.64]Put away the sausages.
[229:57.50]My imposition might well be about to be stopped.
[230:00.24]We'll break through.
[230:00.86]It's not for nothing that I'm smoking so much.
[230:03.04]Me and my friends will break through.
[230:19.11]Sausages are really heavy.
[230:20.33]Why are they so heavy?
[230:21.15]Why is the bread and sausage is so heavy?
[230:22.79]What's what it's really something's weighing me down bad I
[230:35.80]I'm like right almost at that shit.
[230:37.38]Okay, well, that's fine.
[230:38.06]I need bandages.
[230:38.54]I don't think I need all this bread, but whatever.
[230:41.58]Ten shotguns.
[230:59.39]No.
[231:01.13]I'm keeping the shotgun.
[231:01.91]I like to use it.
[231:04.85]We'll keep that shit in there for now.
[231:06.42]Alright, let's go.
[231:07.08]Yeah, I only have one shotgun.
[231:09.24]It's the ammo that's weighing you down.
[231:24.55]Alright, let's see.
[231:25.63]This is the new pistol.
[231:28.11]Looks like it's pretty cool.
[231:32.44]And I still have this shit on.
[231:35.20]This is the one that has a super rate of fire.
[231:38.24]I get the grenades.
[231:39.86]I only have four pizzas, but it's okay.
[231:45.99]Alright.
[231:47.73]Let's call it a night after.
[231:49.53]Let's do one more thing here.
[231:54.27]pipe tunnel.
[231:57.25]Lab entrance.
[231:57.99]Alright, what was on a very specific mission here?
[232:02.81]Tasks.
[232:04.73]Kill Strelok.
[232:06.37]Find Strelok and kill him.
[232:07.47]Sneak into the base.
[232:08.13]Take the key to the lab.
[232:09.63]Get out of the bandit base.
[232:10.67]Yeah.
[232:12.21]Kill the bandit leader.
[232:12.87]Come back.
[232:14.25]Back for the reward.

[232:18.99]Completed.
[232:20.16]Active.
[232:23.27]Gotta get the X-18.
[232:23.89]Wait, what are you guys talking about?
[232:31.52]Put my armor on?
[232:33.53]My armor is just on.
[232:35.85]What?
[232:48.87]Go turn in all the quests, the lab's the best part.
[232:51.91]Am I hungry right now?
[232:55.63]That means I'm hungry.
[232:59.25]Okay, well I had to eat a sausage for a second.
[233:01.19]Sorry, hold on guys.
[233:02.05]When's the last time I streamed a new or modern game?
[233:10.41]Oh, it's been a while.
[233:14.70]Nothing's come out that I've really cared about.
[233:19.03]And just because something's new doesn't mean I'm gonna, like, play it, you know?
[233:22.67]In fact, it's the exact opposite.
[233:25.17]Fuck off.
[233:28.29]Wait, how did I even get in here?
[233:29.37]Red Dead.
[233:29.94]Um... No, it's just like... I need to go out this door.
[233:32.96]What the fuck is this guy talking about?
[233:52.24]Alright.
[233:53.38]What's the button to center the camera on you?
[233:55.02]Because that's kind of getting on my nerves.
[233:57.12]What is the actual button to, like, to make it so just here you are?
[234:03.77]Why won't they let me leave?
[234:04.61]It's a restricted area?
[234:07.11]You mean, like, leaving the compound?
[234:10.22]What?
[234:10.40]No, sorry, this is restricted.
[234:16.12]You can't leave.
[234:16.96]Get out of here, stalker.
[234:29.42]Alright, bye guys.
[234:33.90]I'm trying to get out of here.
[234:36.82]Alright, let's go.
[234:38.96]Here come all the dogs.
[234:42.09]Already off to a great start.
[234:47.71]Run.
[234:48.49]Run.
[234:50.15]Run, please.
[234:50.95]Oh, run, please.
[234:52.69]Okay, good.
[234:58.26]Get out of here, stalker.
[235:03.14]so uh yeah but I mean modern games like games that like what's a modern game that's come out that I wouldn't want to play wrong way what do you mean wrong way don't I need to be going this way wait what hold on a second what's going what the is going on here
[235:32.99]Do I need to go, like, underground or something like that?
[235:35.79]Like, in the sewer again?
[235:42.77]Is it the right way here?
[235:48.50]Um... I mean, like, Absolver's coming out?
[235:51.58]Like, I'm gonna play that.
[235:53.80]For sure.
[235:54.16]It's gonna spawn an anomaly.
[235:57.33]Just... You... Just...
[236:03.43]I tried to avoid one anomaly and I got sucked into another one and I can't leave.
[236:12.64]Try to get away from one and you run into another.
[236:15.94]Oh my god, they are fucking everywhere.
[236:17.78]They're everywhere.
[236:22.25]We're good.
[236:24.27]Hello again.
[236:29.83]But until something comes out that's new that I like, I'm not going to play something just because it came out.
[236:41.17]There's plenty of fucking people that will play brand new games that just came out.
[236:47.51]And unless I'm really interested in them, I don't really care, you know?
[236:55.61]it's got a lot of stuff yeah observer is one of those games I was gonna play observer but from what I was told it's a uh it's a fairly slow game right and you kind of really don't do anything it's kind of just like you enjoy the experience and there's a ton of dialogue and it would just be me like sitting there watching the movie and like talking over dialogue and I I don't know
[237:21.22]I feel the same way about, um, Hellblade.
[237:24.26]I was gonna play Hellblade with Senua's Sacrifice, but that's another one of those games that's kind of... Hold on, what are we walking into here?
[237:35.45]I guess I just gotta fucking power through it somehow.
[237:37.81]Ow.
[237:40.13]Ow.
[237:41.63]Ow.
[237:44.51]Ow.
[237:46.73]Ow.
[237:48.33]Ow.
[237:50.04]Ow.
[237:50.72]We're okay.
[237:52.60]Just ran through a radiation field.
[237:59.28]But there's a lot of games that I missed that I want to play.
[238:01.52]There's a lot of games that came out over the last like five years or so that I really want to play.
[238:06.08]And on stream seems like the best solution for that, right?
[238:26.80]I have to do it every time.
[238:27.64]I mean, it's gonna happen.
[238:29.65]Oh, wait, we're getting back to where we were supposed to be.
[238:31.55]I was lying on the ground, you were... That's great.
[238:34.69]I'm gonna get back to where I was as an actor.
[238:37.15]Okay, scum.
[238:39.97]You can leave.
[238:41.25]Just don't let me see you ever again.
[238:43.07]Yeah, this is Robert Atkins.
[238:44.43]Robert... Robin Atkins down.
[238:46.82]The medic from TF2.
[238:49.14]Follow me.
[238:49.92]I know a good place for an ambush.
[238:51.98]I'll thank you for your help.
[238:54.00]At duty, we always pay our debts.
[238:57.43]Uh, Metro is one of those things.
[239:00.13]Fear 3 is one of those things.
[239:04.57]Uh, like, Two Worlds.
[239:06.35]Two Worlds 2 is another game that I want to play.
[239:10.81]He has a scope.
[239:13.29]I could take the scope, yeah.
[239:17.17]Like, Prey.
[239:18.35]Like, Thief.
[239:20.33]There's a bunch of games that, like, I've wanted to play.
[239:23.48]Even stuff like this, that I knew has come out, but never really had an opportunity to catch it and try to play it.
[239:30.84]Especially when they're open-world-esque kind of games with interesting stuff going on.
[239:34.34]This guy's going to get electrocuted.
[239:36.52]And you guys have all made fun of me.
[239:38.16]Like, this guy's about to walk right into one.
[239:41.96]No, he's smarter than me.
[239:48.38]Fear 1, like, all the fears...
[239:51.94]But Fear 3 could be funny.
[239:58.79]I just want to do it all.
[240:00.31]I want to do it all.
[240:02.39]There's a bunch of games, like for instance, this next week.
[240:04.41]We're going to play a game on Tuesday.
[240:09.12]Wait, I'm not going to say that yet.
[240:11.68]But just next week, hopefully Tuesday.
[240:15.30]If not Tuesday, then Thursday or Friday.
[240:17.03]We're going to play Mindjacket.
[240:19.39]Go look up Mindjack and see if that's a game you think that you'd want to see played.
[240:24.10]That's going to be like... I have a feeling that's going to be one of those 10 out of 10 streams.
[240:33.00]Mindjack.
[240:33.94]Go look it up.
[240:39.68]He just told me to be the point man here.
[240:41.32]Are we waiting for him?
[240:52.08]Play Knack.
[240:52.72]Mindjack is terrible.
[240:53.86]I know, but dude, you... You, like, control civilians' brains and stuff, and you, like, take over people's minds and play as them.
[241:06.99]It's gonna be so dumb.
[241:08.05]I can't wait.
[241:09.07]I remember that game from when I was younger.
[241:10.81]And being like, this game is fucking great.
[241:12.62]I thought the game was fun.
[241:13.96]What an idiot.
[241:18.40]What?
[241:20.64]What did I do wrong?
[241:27.18]How far away was this?
[241:28.78]Fuck me.
[241:29.53]God damn it, I didn't fucking save it.
[241:35.83]I shot the guy that I was supposed to save?
[241:37.44]That was the guy?
[241:38.04]That was the wrong guy.
[241:39.90]And now I have to do this again.
[241:40.86]Ay-yi-ya-dius mio.
[241:45.42]That was the hostage.
[241:47.13]Why would the hostage be on the right side?
[241:49.57]You have the two brutes that hold the guy in the middle so he doesn't go left and he doesn't go right.
[241:54.61]Why would the hostage be on the right side?
[241:56.93]He should be in the middle in like handcuffs.
[242:12.29]They were making him walk in front of him.
[242:14.01]Big mistake!
[242:16.83]Big mistake.
[242:29.65]Look, if I wasn't having fun, I wouldn't... Okay, the first, like, 30 minutes of this stream, I was kind of like, I don't like this.
[242:36.22]It's too hard.
[242:37.10]No, I like it.
[242:38.06]This game's fun.
[242:39.82]It's fun, it's unpredictable, and it's interesting.
[242:41.70]So...
[242:44.46]I may have been a little salty in the first, like, 20, 30 minutes of the stream, but we have embraced the game.
[242:49.55]I've embraced the salt.
[242:52.79]I'm enjoying myself immensely.
[242:54.13]Alright, let's wait.
[242:59.70]Here they come.
[243:19.91]It's not one of those things that's spawning on me, right?
[243:25.17]One of us.
[243:27.21]Need to save emote.
[243:36.50]I'm bored.
[243:37.54]Come on, I'm getting bored of this.
[243:48.91]Incoming joke.
[243:50.25]Get your LOLs ready.
[243:52.32]Get your LULs ready.
[243:54.30]I'm gonna look over and I'm gonna see it.
[243:55.94]Everyone's gonna think this is so funny.
[243:57.70]Where's my gun?
[244:13.21]What?
[244:15.77]Where the fuck was my gun?
[244:17.05]That guy's dead.
[244:26.95]Oh shit, I might be in trouble here.
[244:47.59]Alright.
[244:49.15]Wait for my command.
[244:50.13]Alright, I'm going to get the guy.
[244:52.61]I'm going to get a headshot on the guy on the right.
[244:53.93]You get the guy on the left.
[244:55.51]Milena, when do you want to go?
[244:57.02]One, two, three.
[245:12.45]Got him.
[245:16.14]What do you have?
[245:16.48]What do you have in his backpack?
[245:18.44]What does he have in his backpack?
[245:20.16]Hey, thanks, bro.
[245:21.48]Backpack.
[245:22.18]Backpack.
[245:22.42]Backpack.
[245:22.76]Drink, bro.
[245:46.47]Thanks, bro.
[245:51.11]Oh, I haven't heard much.
[245:53.07]All I know is that their boss, Barov, is part of the key on the ground there.
[245:58.47]Bok.
[245:59.51]Bok bok.
[246:00.65]You guys are fucking crazy.
[246:01.99]I love it.
[246:03.37]Well, it used to be a lab or something.
[246:04.69]I did hear that Barov has been eager to get inside, but can't without the second half of the key.
[246:09.29]Think of trying to get inside?
[246:10.17]Think twice before you do.
[246:10.99]It's full of thugs.
[246:13.53]I'll help your man.
[246:15.67]Free the guy from prison.
[246:17.67]Sure.
[246:18.73]Thanks, bro.
[246:22.25]Uh, here's some money.
[246:24.29]Okay, trade.
[246:26.73]You don't got anything.
[246:28.33]Ooh, what's the scope?
[246:30.67]What?
[246:30.85]I don't care about anything you say right now.
[246:34.84]I have a scope now?
[246:35.76]What can I put it on?
[246:37.64]Attach scope to rifle.
[246:41.14]Ooh, wait a minute.
[246:42.06]Which one do I want it on?
[246:48.43]This one.
[246:50.25]No.
[246:55.29]Fast shooting AK.
[247:01.66]I'm sorry.
[247:02.56]Oh God, I'm sorry.
[247:06.50]I think I want to put it on here.
[247:10.24]Because this one, the handling on that one's better though.
[247:13.54]Don't... The accuracy is better on this one.
[247:15.63]Okay.
[247:17.27]Let's go up on the shotgun.
[247:20.01]Alright, I got a scope on it now.
[247:26.23]Ooh.
[247:27.87]Oh, perfect.
[247:28.53]It's been so long.
[247:29.45]I've been playing for like four hours and I haven't got something like this.
[247:34.26]Where is it?
[247:37.26]Where is it?
[247:41.38]Okay, nice.
[247:42.56]Nice.
[247:43.58]Unload that shit.
[247:45.80]Okay.
[247:48.93]This thing really is... What's that Call of Duty sniper rifle?
[247:51.83]This really does look like Call of Duty.
[247:53.89]Fucking cod, man.
[247:55.35]Cod.
[247:55.67]Alright.
[247:58.49]Thanks for your help.
[247:59.17]Bye-bye.
[247:59.63]Yep, yep, yep.
[248:00.31]Okay, let's go.
[248:02.15]Oh, dear.
[248:03.52]This is you.
[248:04.14]There's a lot going on here.
[248:07.86]Lab entrance.
[248:09.92]Prisoner.
[248:13.25]Captive duty member.
[248:15.09]Tunnel, my lord.
[248:17.83]Let's go here.
[248:18.41]I feel more comfortable over here right now.
[248:23.71]Yeah, this view model is way too big.
[248:26.87]This is a camera.
[248:28.97]This is an expensive fucking camera.
[248:30.87]This camera is like $14,000.
[248:33.55]I'm not even holding a gun.
[248:34.63]We're making a movie.
[248:36.76]Alright, let's make a movie with this guy.
[248:42.76]The game just got 5,000 times easier.
[248:56.19]What is videotaping, guys?
[248:57.39]I need to go get the key from Borov.
[249:08.23]Well, Borov, where the fuck are you?
[249:13.37]Hello!
[249:22.08]Yeah, get videotaped with bullets.
[249:29.66]The guy's behind me somehow.
[249:33.90]There he is.
[249:41.29]Oh, we'll get him, guys.
[249:42.37]Don't you worry.
[249:48.41]What?
[249:48.83]So I can't go into the lab yet.
[249:59.89]Is what you guys are saying, right?
[250:03.39]Nice shooting.
[250:05.09]You give me like a... I'm terrible with iron sights.
[250:08.22]You give me a scope.
[250:10.28]We got another thing.
[250:11.44]You got another thing coming.
[250:15.61]Give me a scope.
[250:16.23]You got another thing coming.
[250:21.94]Uh, I don't think I have to... I can't go this way, I guess, right?
[250:24.26]I love that you guys are pogchamping for me to, like, just, like, shooting regular, like, good, easy shots.
[250:37.07]Just wait till I do a good one.
[250:48.67]Wait till I go.
[250:49.59]Wait till you see a good one.
[251:05.60]Getting regular easy shots.
[251:08.84]Okay, I thought that was a monster behind me.
[251:10.74]It's just me.
[251:20.68]Okay, I don't think there's anything I can do here.
[251:27.93]I mean, I could go, like, down.
[251:32.75]I am the monster, that's right.
[251:35.03]I'll never forget it.
[251:42.44]What?! !
[252:04.50]Don't you ever forget it.
[252:09.26]Don't ever forget it, guys.
[252:11.04]The view model fucked me.
[252:14.68]The view model is what fucking ruined everything.
[252:18.69]I love that so much.
[252:29.71]Alright, I think I'm gonna call it a night up here in a minute.
[252:35.46]For how big this scope is, I would figure this would go across like 50 football fields.
[252:40.30]Nope.
[252:41.88]It's like 30 feet.
[252:43.98]This is like a 30-yard scope.
[252:51.32]I thought this was a 24-hour stream.
[252:53.00]No.
[252:54.82]No, it's not.
[253:01.06]I gotta get one, like, fucking PogChamp shot before the stream is over.
[253:06.62]I thought that was a guy.
[253:09.28]What was that?
[253:16.69]An artifact.
[253:17.19]Cool.
[253:23.31]Okay, here we go.
[253:25.71]Gotta get my one fucking PogChamp.
[253:33.70]Can't go there.
[253:34.38]Alright, get your breath, dude.
[253:42.80]I haven't even read any, like, bits or anything.
[253:44.87]I gotta do that, too, before the stream is over.
[253:46.71]I'm sorry I've been not looking at that.
[253:49.57]I've been too brain-focused on this the whole time.
[253:52.77]And alt-tabbing, it messes up the game a little bit, so... Sorry I have not been keeping up with that one.
[254:01.40]Can't even go this way.
[254:06.99]pit streamer.
[254:09.76]I'm like, can I not?
[254:11.10]Like, really?
[254:15.82]How do I get in here?
[254:19.22]This whole place is blocked off.
[254:24.01]Will I play Call of Pripyat?
[254:27.51]Um, okay, here we go.
[254:28.39]Here's an opportunity for the PogChamp.
[254:29.91]Here it comes.
[254:57.21]Yeah, there it is.
[255:06.07]Get me in here.
[255:08.39]Watch this one.
[255:11.22]Didn't even fucking aim.
[255:12.20]Got him.
[255:15.74]What about this one?
[255:24.29]What about this one?
[255:27.85]How's this one?
[255:29.57]Wait.
[255:31.67]How long does this last in my hand?
[255:34.59]Didn't I pull the pin out?
[255:35.37]Yeah, I pulled out the pin.
[255:48.76]I think this one's a dud.
[255:58.66]Oh, okay.
[256:01.09]Grenades have a bar you can hold.
[256:02.43]No, they don't!
[256:03.41]I only know what grenades are from cartoons, Etalyx!
[256:07.03]You go like this, and then it explodes!
[256:15.80]Alright, I think I'm gonna call it a night here.
[256:23.47]I think I'm gonna get some food.
[256:26.96]Uh, there will be a stream before Tuesday.
[256:31.23]I'm probably going to do an off-stream maybe Monday?
[256:36.15]We've had some fun this week, for sure.
[256:40.83]So, I might just stream this again on, like, Monday.
[256:48.96]What am I going to eat tonight?
[256:49.72]Uh, I don't know.
[256:53.94]Yeah, I'm having fun with this game.
[256:55.78]So, I'm willing to do an off stream and just play it again.
[257:00.51]This is a fun game.
[257:01.35]There's enough interesting things going on for my brain to still care about it.
[257:06.47]So, on Monday... ...expect an off scheduled stream of this.
[257:12.75]Just stream until Monday.
[257:15.81]I have to get one good shot though.
[257:19.05]Let's get everybody's attention.
[257:23.51]Guy in the window.
[257:24.05]Ready?
[257:25.56]Guy's gonna come out the door and I'm gonna get him.
[257:29.06]Let me just, like, close my eyes.
[257:30.24]There's nobody there now.
[257:36.06]Alright.
[257:36.87]Well, that's it, guys.
[257:37.77]Does the gas station blow up?
[257:42.85]Is it like every video game where the gas station explodes?
[257:46.81]No.
[257:47.58]The gas station does not explode.
[257:52.95]At what point am I going to kill all the memes?
[257:54.85]You know, maybe I'll get that ready for next week, too.
[257:57.39]And just we'll do that for, like... Because I am going to... No, I can't.
[258:02.92]Is that the room he's in?
[258:03.70]He's, like, trying to avoid the grenade.
[258:12.16]Is that the room that he's in?
[258:17.15]How is he still alive?
[258:20.63]Oh, no, that's...
[258:26.52]You know, he's not in there.
[258:29.28]All the way up?
[258:32.48]Fuck me.
[258:38.81]He was in the basement.
[258:41.39]Alright, goodnight everybody.
[258:43.65]See you guys on Monday.
[258:45.93]Oh, now I'm like crashed out.
[258:47.17]Oh, hold on.
[258:49.28]Now I'm like all fucked up.
[258:51.78]No, hold on.
[258:53.78]What the fuck have I done?
[258:56.56]Alright.
[258:57.06]Give me a second.
[258:57.54]Alright.
[258:57.80]Good night, everybody.
[258:59.08]I'll see you.
[259:00.66]Oh, yeah.
[259:01.06]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[259:04.15]Let the intro play out.
[259:05.15]Play us out for a second.
[259:05.97]I'm going to read these bits.
[259:06.89]Hold on.
[259:29.59]James!
[259:31.51]James Surveyor.
[259:32.93]Thanks for the bits.
[259:34.07]Jerma the skilled trader.
[259:35.71]He's reading in his head.
[259:38.95]Sometimes you fucking mute the mic and you're a fucking idiot.
[259:42.58]Thank you, James, for the bits.
[259:44.18]Velroy, thank you for the bits.
[259:46.48]Blue Shadow, thank you for the bits as well.
[259:48.66]This is my favorite game.
[259:49.58]Thanks for playing it.
[259:50.84]When you have an auto weapon and in short to mid-range, aim for the center mass and fire in bursts of four to five.
[259:56.28]Recoil will do the work for you.
[259:57.78]Well, thank you, Blue.
[260:00.34]SuperHats, thanks again for the bits.
[260:03.33]Devakitty, thank you as well.
[260:05.19]Gerber, you're getting better and I'm proud.
[260:06.91]Fuck all the elitists in the chat.
[260:08.96]And look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[260:12.32]I understand that when you like have when you have like 500 hours in a game that's like this and like the stuff as easy as like how do you unload the clip from a gun?
[260:26.63]It can be kind of irritating because you've done it five fucking million times and you're watching some guy fumble through reading people's diaries trying to figure out what electricity does.
[260:36.45]I understand.
[260:37.23]I get it.
[260:38.49]But like, but look, can we have some civility?
[260:40.89]That's all.
[260:41.44]Can we just have some civility about the whole damn thing?
[260:46.06]It's alright.
[260:47.36]I know that I, I know that I can be a fucking idiot.
[260:50.04]And I'm, I'm, I'm first to tell you that.
[260:53.92]Clip?
[260:55.20]Clip.
[260:56.08]Oh no, he said clip.
[260:57.78]He didn't say magazine.
[260:59.89]Oh no, let's, let's, let's burn his house down.
[261:02.23]He said clip.
[261:07.75]Anyways, I hope I can, like, obviously I try to learn as fast as I can.
[261:13.97]And sometimes when you look over a chat and somebody's like, I hate you, you suck.
[261:19.31]You need to learn faster.
[261:21.19]It's like, look, go learn a new language, right?
[261:23.89]If you go to school and you sit down and like somebody, okay, if you were sitting down across from me and you were reading me Spanish and you're like, excuse me, Jeremy, I'd like to teach you Spanish.
[261:33.62]Okay, can we start with hi, hello, and goodbye?
[261:37.80]Then he starts going off on like fucking like, he starts reading me like the great Gatsby in Spanish and expecting me to understand him.
[261:43.95]It's like, dude, you got to start with like, thank you.
[261:46.53]Like, I don't know how, how do I say thank you?
[261:48.13]I don't even know how to say thank you.
[261:49.95]You got to start small and then we can start to read entire novels in Spanish.
[261:56.99]What if I don't know Spanish?
[262:01.55]In my younger and more vulnerable years,
[262:06.77]Learning a new video game is apparently the equivalent of learning an entirely new language.
[262:10.83]Well, games like this that don't give you very much to go on.
[262:15.37]Like, I didn't know what, like, unloading magazines and stuff, like, I don't know, like, I don't even know how to, like, equip guns.
[262:20.68]Like, this game's, this game's fucking ten years old.
[262:28.38]And I'm giving you, as a metaphor.
[262:32.01]Never spoke in this language.
[262:33.57]S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
[262:33.91]is a new language.
[262:38.59]Nothing to go on, no tutorial.
[262:40.65]Come on.
[262:48.38]Stalker is a very blind experience, even if you don't actually go in blind.
[262:53.02]Yeah.
[262:53.24]And look, I understand.
[262:53.94]Like I told you, like if you guys have a ton of time in this game and you look at me like I can walk around in circles for a minute, like 10 minutes.
[263:01.95]No, I understand your frustration, but I'm trying.
[263:04.63]That's all I can do.
[263:06.17]Anyways, thank you.
[263:07.71]Thank you, Devakitty.
[263:09.91]Mr. Mick, I can't say your name out loud.
[263:12.76]It's something about like it's a sexual thing.
[263:15.52]It's something about it.
[263:16.52]I'm going to say each individual word of your name.
[263:20.81]in a different spot.
[263:21.85]So, Pfister, Mr. Mick,
[263:26.54]And then a relative that is your, a female relative that is in your direct family.
[263:33.01]So there you go.
[263:33.81]Thank you for the $5.
[263:35.89]The game gets much easier if you play on Master.
[263:38.33]Not joking, it's something to do with the in-game mechanics.
[263:40.53]That is on Master.
[263:42.19]We were playing on Master.
[263:44.92]If you just caught the end of the stream here.
[263:47.28]Master is the difficulty we were on.
[263:52.04]Beg, but thank you though, Mr. Mr. Man, for the five bucks.
[263:57.32]I don't even know if these people are even still here, but I'm going to read it anyways.
[263:59.94]Bego, thank you Bego for the nine dollars.
[264:03.72]Mr. Family member with a sexual problem there, ten dollars.
[264:08.72]Wait till you get to lab X18.
[264:09.98]It's so funny you said that two hours ago, and we're about to do that, so we'll see what happens there on Monday.
[264:16.03]But thanks a lot, dude.
[264:16.68]That's like 15 bucks.
[264:18.34]Goron, thank you for the $15.
[264:21.33]Jess says, bunch of cheer 100s.
[264:23.15]Thanks a lot, Goron.
[264:23.97]780 or 7080.
[264:29.28]Brut209, thanks for the bits.
[264:30.90]Darkstar, thanks for the free dolls.
[264:32.26]Not enough accidental screenshots.
[264:34.71]Yeah.
[264:37.13]That is true.
[264:39.09]RascalNag, thank you for the five bucks.
[264:41.17]I'm ecstatic that you're giving this a shot.
[264:42.71]It starts out very intimidating, but once you embrace your inner Russian-Ukrainian, it's unforgettable.
[264:49.53]then that yep that you are you are describing exactly how I feel because the first like 45 minutes was a little too much for me to handle but I stuck with it and I think it's a very good game so I'm gonna stick with it but thank you the five dollars evo uh thank you evolved ed for the 14 no message just says cheer cheer thanks for the 14 bucks dude and then a couple more actually there's a lot of money tonight damn
[265:15.81]I can't believe I missed all this shit.
[265:16.93]I was too focused.
[265:18.55]But thank you guys all, regardless.
[265:21.73]Steampunk, thanks for the bits.
[265:23.07]234, to be exact.
[265:24.62]I hope this one works, because last time I asked you about Jake Paul and looked stupid.
[265:30.31]Well, if you have a question for me about Jake Paul, I'm not even going to... You don't talk... No, I'm not talking about Jake Paul.
[265:38.55]He's a guy and he's one of those people now that... I'm done.
[265:43.29]We already said his name.
[265:44.85]So we already said Voldemort's name.
[265:46.83]So now he's real.
[265:50.95]Shout out to Etalyx because he wants to be on stream.
[265:52.79]Why don't you shout out subs?
[265:54.21]You know that.
[265:55.99]Because he's dead.
[265:59.59]Anyways.
[266:01.39]Thank you, Steampunk.
[266:03.65]Also, Sly, thanks for the bits.
[266:06.23]Options always reset in this game, and I think difficulty resets to the highest, too.
[266:09.94]Oh, whatever.
[266:10.32]It's okay.
[266:11.74]Vic Vinegar gave $10 a long time ago.
[266:13.92]He might not even be here, but thanks anyways if you're still here.
[266:17.62]Shoot him one more time.
[266:18.46]He seems too nice.
[266:19.18]I think he's referring to when the guy first got in the game.
[266:21.72]He's from at least four hours ago.
[266:24.78]Uh, McJab, McJabba, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[266:28.24]Not even that sexy.
[266:30.44]Um, I didn't, I, hey, come on.
[266:32.60]Come on, I'm a little bit sexy.
[266:34.29]Thanks for the 10 bucks, dude.
[266:35.97]Uh, bought a, Jesus Christ, there's a lot of money tonight.
[266:39.65]There's a, there's a lot of fucking money.
[266:43.09]Damn.
[266:44.51]Thank you, guys.
[266:45.25]Like, I did not expect to look over here and see, like, fucking, like, 300 bucks across, like, fucking 20 different people.
[266:51.70]But, thank you.
[266:54.28]Bada Bing, it's Ben.
[266:55.20]Thanks for the $10.
[266:56.90]Did somebody say Skate 3?
[266:58.08]I'm never playing Skate 3.
[267:03.61]But thank you, Bada Bing.
[267:05.27]Sputnik, thanks for the $5.
[267:06.13]Yo, Jerma, I missed the last four streams, so here's some compensation for you.
[267:10.55]Thanks for making me laugh.
[267:11.36]Well, thanks for the $5.
[267:12.22]Appreciate it.
[267:14.12]Boneless bacon makes it to the $6.
[267:15.55]Does Demonloadsaraxos like diet sausage instead of regular?
[267:18.77]Now, Demonloadsaraxos eats humans.
[267:21.09]He literally rips people's skulls off and drinks the blood out of their severed neck.
[267:25.05]So he does not eat sausage at all.
[267:26.69]Unless it's a person.
[267:27.43]You can make a person sausage and put it in the casing and pump it through and maybe he would eat it.
[267:32.31]But thanks for the $6.
[267:34.77]Ratbag, thanks Ratbag for the bits.
[267:36.55]Also Steampunk again.
[267:37.63]Who's my favorite character in Game of Thrones and why is it Stannis Baratheon?
[267:41.85]No, that's not true.
[267:42.51]It's actually Varys.
[267:44.17]Varys is my favorite character in Game of Thrones.
[267:45.80]I think he's the most interesting.
[267:48.16]Alex James, thanks for the $6.66.
[267:49.38]Hey Jerma, I just got into Cardiff University.
[267:55.26]Finally I can start earning and paying my crab taxes like a real adult.
[268:01.08]Well, congratulations.
[268:02.92]Thank you for the $6.66 Satan bucks.
[268:07.00]Uh, ostriches.
[268:07.96]Thank you, ostriches, for the bits.
[268:09.56]First Dermastream been subbed to the channel since I was a freshman in high school.
[268:12.80]Well, damn, dude, thanks a lot.
[268:13.72]Appreciate that.
[268:15.78]That's a long time.
[268:18.08]But I'm not sure if it's a long time, because I don't know when you were a freshman.
[268:21.00]Could have been, like, last year.
[268:21.84]Could have been, like, five years ago.
[268:22.90]But anyways, thanks a lot.
[268:25.31]Only a couple more left to go here.
[268:26.47]Radio Vidya, thanks for the five bucks.
[268:28.77]This game is pretty slow, but if you stick with it, you'll have a good time.
[268:31.27]Plus, please put on your best Russian accent when talking to NPCs.
[268:36.18]I tried.
[268:37.26]I tried it, and everyone laughed at me.
[268:40.34]Vame, thanks for the $3.30.
[268:42.60]This is going to end badly, this stream.
[268:44.92]No, it didn't.
[268:45.74]That's the thing.
[268:46.28]It did not end badly.
[268:47.17]It ended up pretty well.
[268:48.47]Started off bad.
[268:49.35]Started off frustrating, and started off... I was getting called names, and I started... Look, don't ever call anybody names.
[268:56.14]Like, well, actually, you can call me names.
[268:57.54]I really don't give a shit.
[268:59.61]You don't have to call anybody names.
[269:00.61]I don't even care.
[269:02.99]The Orange Pyro Ranger.
[269:04.27]Thanks for the two bucks.
[269:05.45]And finally, King of Whales was the first person to give even a cent.
[269:09.63]Do you own this keyboard?
[269:11.99]That was four hours ago.
[269:15.75]That's gonna be it.
[269:16.63]Thank you for all the resubs, all the new subs.
[269:18.03]You guys rock.
[269:19.13]I will see you guys on Monday.
[269:20.13]We will continue this game.
[269:23.63]And with that,
[269:25.46]Have a good rest of your evening.
[269:28.10]Much love.
[269:30.04]Deckhead.
[269:33.36]Go get a mod.
[269:34.18]We'll see how it goes on Monday.
[269:36.12]I might stream for only a couple hours on Monday.
[269:38.64]We'll see.
[269:44.16]I timed somebody out when they called me a butthead one time.
[269:47.83]Yeah, but that was just a joke.
[269:49.97]99% of the time when I say something as stupid as somebody in chat, it's a joke.
[269:52.91]So don't worry about it.
[269:54.65]We're just fucking around.
[269:57.67]Good night everybody.
[269:59.26]Have a good weekend.
[270:00.88]Goodbye.
[270:05.26]Oh, there was no audio on this the whole time.
[270:07.64]Oh well.
[270:09.10]Sorry.
[270:11.19]Good night everybody.
[270:49.34]so
[271:24.21]Thank you.
