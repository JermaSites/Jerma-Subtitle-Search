[01:07.26]Oh, I don't have a... Where's my intro video?
[01:09.06]Oh, that's right.
[01:09.86]I cleaned up.
[01:10.62]I cleaned up.
[01:11.47]Here, go back to talking to each other.
[01:14.15]Sure, hold on.
[01:14.69]Go back to talking to each other.
[01:40.04]Shit, I think I deleted them.
[01:42.72]So, alright, I do this thing every year where I clean up my computer.
[01:47.60]Delete a bunch of old shit, delete a bunch of old temporary documents, and I think I deleted my intro videos.
[01:56.57]And my outro videos.
[02:00.99]How did I do that?
[02:01.58]No, I didn't.
[02:02.14]Why would I have done that?
[02:03.32]Because I just tried to play it and it didn't work.
[02:05.24]Hold on.
[02:07.83]Ah, shit.
[02:09.07]This is the new intro.
[02:11.50]Wait, wait, wait, I'll get it, I'll get it.
[02:14.66]Where is it?
[02:15.32]No, here it is!
[02:16.86]So where the hell is it?
[02:23.02]Oh, alright.
[02:23.74]Why is it over here?
[02:28.26]Well, fuck it, whatever.
[02:29.10]Alright, well, hey guys.
[02:32.09]Today, we're gonna play a game called Black and White.
[02:37.19]Black and white.
[02:40.38]It is a... Alright, I don't want you to... I don't want you on camera anymore.
[02:44.14]Alright, here we go.
[02:45.00]Here's the real intro.
[02:46.92]Where the fuck is it?
[02:47.84]This is actually annoying me.
[02:53.83]Where is it?
[02:56.49]Okay.
[02:56.97]Hey!
[02:57.41]Alright, see you in a minute.
[02:59.41]It's pretty many of them on yet.
[03:00.27]Bye.
[04:23.03]Okay, so... The plan today... Yes, I'm not 100% recovered from being sick.
[04:31.21]I remember a few days ago, I started to get a bad migraine, and I was like, ah, fuck, I got a migraine.
[04:37.04]And then, it just turned into a full-blown just head cold.
[04:40.60]I had a bad sore throat, my head was hurting.
[04:44.14]Kim now has it.
[04:46.97]So, it's not good.
[04:49.01]It's just the season.
[04:50.69]But, uh, I'm feeling alright now.
[04:52.81]I'm coming down from it.
[04:53.57]It's been a few days.
[04:55.33]And my head is not as hurting as much.
[04:58.83]So, I can spring.
[05:00.57]Good to go.
[05:02.91]With that, we're gonna play, like I said, Black and White.
[05:05.22]If you've never heard of Black and White before, you're probably like, wait a minute, and if you have heard of Black and White, you just, you just pogged your pants right now.
[05:11.82]You shit your pants.
[05:12.98]Because this is, this is one of the most classic
[05:19.20]Old, god-simulating games that existed.
[05:23.00]Everybody that had a PC back 10, 15 years ago loved this game.
[05:27.54]It's a Lionhead game.
[05:28.86]It's old Lionhead.
[05:32.79]The problem is they never ported it anywhere.
[05:34.81]They never did anything with this.
[05:36.43]This series is just lost forever, apparently.
[05:40.83]They made a second one.
[05:43.58]But it's just one of those games that everybody's just, where's the third one?
[05:48.52]Give us a new black and white, please.
[05:53.51]It's one of those games.
[05:55.37]So, without further ado, welcome back, everybody.
[05:58.31]I cannot promise you a, like, 12-hour stream today.
[06:02.27]But I can promise you a 10.
[06:05.69]Let's go.
[06:06.73]Black and white.
[06:09.26]Why did I just, no, why did I just say that?
[06:11.16]I'm not, this is, I'm not doing a ten hour stream.
[06:13.33]This is probably gonna be like five.
[06:16.25]I got a headache, okay?
[06:17.43]I got a headache.
[06:18.39]I got a headache.
[06:19.39]I got a headache.
[06:20.11]I'm doing it, and I'm not doing that.
[06:22.77]Liar.
[06:23.87]Liar!
[06:25.83]Here we go.
[06:26.43]Black and white.
[06:28.46]On an HD screen.
[06:30.90]That's right.
[06:33.18]Wait, hold on, I gotta do this first.
[06:39.00]Alright, you get one more second.
[06:43.06]Make it count because this is never happening ever again.
[06:50.52]Done.
[06:52.76]Okay, somebody pogged their pants already.
[06:58.91]That's so stupid.
[06:59.63]Alright, here we go.
[07:01.99]Black and white.
[07:03.29]Open it.
[07:07.02]Uh-oh, did it just insta-crash?
[07:09.33]Wait, I tested this like a thousand times.
[07:11.19]I tested this a thousand times.
[07:13.95]This should not have insta-crashed.
[07:16.27]Okay, I tested this a thousand times.
[07:18.15]It insta-crashed.
[07:20.17]Hold on.
[07:23.89]Okay.
[07:24.64]Jesus, man.
[07:26.60]Gonna give me a fucking heart attack.
[07:28.20]I was gonna say, no way.
[07:37.89]Black and white, ladies and gentlemen.
[07:40.79]Lionhead Studios.
[07:42.61]Peter Molyneux.
[07:45.11]The greatest video game developer to have ever fucking lived.
[07:52.20]In his own words.
[07:56.28]Please choose from one of the following options.
[08:00.84]Start the game normally.
[08:01.74]Skip straight to the creature select.
[08:03.03]Skip all of the creature to keep your... Alright.
[08:05.73]I did open... I'm gonna be completely transparent here.
[08:08.21]I did open this.
[08:12.06]Because I wanted to make sure I could get it captured.
[08:14.42]And in full HD texture.
[08:16.22]We're just gonna start the game normally.
[08:20.17]You ready?
[08:22.32]What the fuck is this game?
[08:23.28]You'll see.
[08:24.68]Is it going to be a smash hit?
[08:26.64]I knew it.
[08:27.46]I knew it when I said it.
[08:28.42]I knew it.
[08:30.00]It's going to be a smash hit.
[08:31.79]Remember your favorite stream of like the last 10 years?
[08:35.37]Add this one.
[08:36.25]Smash hit.
[08:36.95]Here we go.
[08:49.25]He jinxed it.
[08:50.75]I'm just kidding.
[08:52.06]Am I, though?
[08:54.70]A land of innocence has no need for gods.
[09:00.40]Until fate intervenes.
[09:09.27]Keep away from the water!
[09:10.69]Don't go in the water!
[09:14.41]Wait, why?
[09:16.27]Why can't... Oh, because there's sharks!
[09:18.69]I was gonna- I'll handle this.
[09:19.57]That kid was fast.
[09:54.78]So those of you that wanted me to play God Hand... This is close enough, I think, right?
[10:00.64]This does two birds with one stone.
[10:24.70]I read this script already.
[10:25.98]Yeah, we talked, we did it.
[10:27.06]Pre-stream gets a couple of jokes that happen on stream, alright?
[10:32.85]And somebody said, hey, I saw that joke four hours ago in pre-stream.
[10:36.43]Yeah, it's a fucking easy joke to make.
[10:39.23]Everybody wants me to play God Hand.
[10:40.61]I'm playing a game where you play a literal hand of a god.
[10:43.95]It's the easiest comedy ever.
[10:45.31]This kid just got hit by a fucking meteor.
[10:47.43]Are you a blessing or a curse?
[10:52.39]Good or evil?
[10:56.02]Be what you will.
[10:57.70]You are destiny.
[11:01.02]Thank you, God.
[11:02.16]You saved our boy.
[11:03.74]I did.
[11:05.08]Thank you.
[11:06.31]Thank you for your mercy.
[11:08.85]We praise you.
[11:10.37]I require all three of you to do a Fortnite dance.
[11:16.01]There it is.
[11:16.61]Okay, good, good.
[11:17.59]I like that one.
[11:18.29]That's the one where you go up and down with your hands.
[11:20.99]Good one.
[11:25.38]Greetings, we're your conscience black and white as part of you will guide you through this world Okay, good and evil Should I be good or should I be evil?
[11:47.77]What do you think?
[11:48.25]Our people will want to worship you
[11:55.05]Please, come with us to our village.
[11:56.72]Be evil?
[11:57.10]Why would I be evil?
[11:57.62]I'll show you how to follow them.
[12:02.72]How to move?
[12:04.32]Let's see.
[12:05.42]You move your hand in the direction you want to travel like this.
[12:09.97]Then you click and hold the move button.
[12:12.83]After that, you move the mouse towards you to drag forwards.
[12:16.39]Yeah, you actually grab the ground and drag.
[12:19.13]You click, hold, and pull again to cover more ground.
[12:22.56]Oops.
[12:23.56]Sorry.
[12:25.09]Yeah, you actually have to grab the hand and move.
[12:32.33]He's got sticky keys on.
[12:33.62]No, I don't.
[12:34.10]Follow your new worshippers to the village.
[12:36.54]You'll have to grab the landscape several times.
[12:38.88]Alright, let's go see their village.
[12:40.76]I actually love this game and its sequel.
[12:42.36]Me too.
[12:42.70]Alright, here we go.
[12:49.45]You don't think this would be scary?
[12:53.91]What's the thing from Adam's family?
[12:56.26]Cousin It?
[12:59.14]This thing's just running next to you?
[13:01.10]Not Cousin It.
[13:01.64]What's it called?
[13:02.62]Not Lurch.
[13:03.16]Lurch is a tall guy.
[13:05.40]Thing.
[13:06.65]I'm right... It's literally right next to you.
[13:13.01]Thing.
[13:13.87]Thing.
[13:14.17]Yes.
[13:14.45]Thing.
[13:14.99]I'm right... I'm literally... You're in my field of view.
[13:23.89]How far away is your village?
[13:24.93]What were you guys doing out here?
[13:25.95]Your arrival was foretold.
[13:28.17]The prophecy has come true.
[13:31.25]We can now finish the temple.
[13:34.56]Let's go.
[13:37.74]Let's move to the temple by clicking and dragging or double click the move button on it to go straight there.
[13:45.72]It's all the same guy.
[13:47.72]Alright, let's move to the temple by clicking and dragging or double click the move button to go straight there.
[13:51.52]Ooh, the move button.
[13:57.18]There it is.
[13:59.41]I think we're almost at the most important part of the entire game.
[14:04.75]And that is, who do I want to be?
[14:07.75]Who do I want?
[14:09.25]What's it talking about?
[14:10.66]What's that mean?
[14:11.16]What are we talking about?
[14:12.48]You'll see.
[14:12.76]Okay.
[14:12.86]Good.
[14:23.97]I'm gonna do a poll.
[14:25.33]I'll- yeah, we'll do a poll.
[14:26.23]You move the hand to the side of the screen until the rotate arrow appears like this.
[14:31.61]You hold down the move button.
[14:34.01]Then you move the hand in a circular motion to rotate around and see things from a different angle.
[14:40.63]Wait, circular motion?
[14:41.81]Hold down the move- You can rotate either way.
[14:43.95]Do a smart click instead.
[14:47.87]I- actually my smart clicks are broken.
[14:50.35]They're all fucked up.
[14:50.93]You can also use the keyboard to rotate.
[14:56.54]Okay, yeah.
[14:57.70]Yeah, just drag it around.
[14:59.16]You can go like this.
[15:01.18]You can go like this.
[15:04.40]Uh... Not little mouse.
[15:06.44]What was it?
[15:06.88]Not right mouse.
[15:07.44]What was it?
[15:08.30]I wasn't paying attention.
[15:08.98]Shift?
[15:09.60]There it is.
[15:13.19]Wait, what?
[15:16.03]Is it not shift?
[15:16.57]Shift what?
[15:19.35]Yeah, I was... Oh, edge of the screen, right?
[15:21.37]Edge of the screen.
[15:22.09]There it is.
[15:24.87]Yes!
[15:26.03]Yes!
[15:27.45]That's right.
[15:27.95]Okay, cool.
[15:32.57]Good.
[15:33.61]Now let's learn how to... How do you look up and down?
[15:37.23]You move your hand to the top or bottom edge of the screen until the pitch arrow appears.
[15:42.58]You hold down the move button.
[15:44.14]I don't want to have to do that.
[15:44.82]What's the key?
[15:45.16]Then you move the hand to look up and down.
[15:47.90]You can do this with the middle mouse button.
[15:51.06]You can do all this with the middle mouse button.
[15:52.50]I don't even need to know this.
[15:55.47]But we have to do the tutorial.
[15:56.65]You can also use the keyboard to pitch.
[15:59.20]Now you have a go.
[16:00.80]Yeah, middle mouse button's gonna do this.
[16:02.36]Splendid!
[16:04.60]That's it.
[16:05.84]That's it.
[16:06.76]You've got the idea.
[16:08.36]But I know that pe- that pe- doing tutorials... It's just a thing.
[16:12.74]One last thing.
[16:13.86]If I just blow through it, I don't care.
[16:15.88]Oh, thank- now it's time to play, and I don't fucking know what I'm doing.
[16:19.15]You move the mouse towards you to zoom out.
[16:20.83]You know what I mean?
[16:21.69]Like, that's... That's gonna make people angry.
[16:25.27]And you move the mouse away from you to zoom in.
[16:30.30]Zooming, as you see, is extremely useful.
[16:33.88]You can also use the keyboard to zoom.
[16:36.24]Now you try.
[16:37.16]Yeah, I know how to do this.
[16:38.94]I know.
[16:39.54]Yeah, and see, I told you.
[16:40.64]I didn't even need to do that.
[16:43.07]That's it.
[16:44.09]You've done it.
[16:45.47]All this moving around is giving me a headache.
[16:48.13]I had one, too.
[16:48.75]I think we may need to practice a bit.
[16:51.31]We can go to the God's Playground by pressing F2 on the keyboard at any time.
[16:56.08]Wait, what?
[16:58.27]Now we've learned how to move and look, we can help the villagers build the temple.
[17:07.19]I saw somebody ResidentSleeper over there.
[17:09.67]I want you to remember that ResidentSleeper in 20 minutes.
[17:15.12]I want you to remember that.
[17:16.66]I want you to wake up and go, what the fuck have I written?
[17:22.14]in 20 minutes I want you to remember what you've written I want you to look at it I want you to look at the screen and go I wrote that 20 minutes ago alright let's take supplies of food and wood from the store to the builders first you move the hand over the food or wood like this you pick up by pressing the action button the longer you hold the more you pick up you can still drag while holding objects
[17:48.92]See, I help.
[17:49.76]I'm just a big hand.
[17:51.38]I'm the giant of the village.
[17:53.52]Alright, here we go.
[18:00.62]So let's get some wood.
[18:07.74]How much wood do we need?
[18:09.60]How much wood do they have?
[18:11.24]Alright, I'm taking all of it.
[18:12.64]I don't need to take this much.
[18:13.74]Alright, I don't need to take this much.
[18:16.66]Okay, I have five thousand...
[18:23.21]How much does it need?
[18:26.93]Alright.
[18:28.19]I got it.
[18:28.61]Wood required, zero.
[18:32.39]Very good.
[18:34.78]He's the wood god.
[18:35.96]See, look at him.
[18:42.75]And it's got great music, too.
[18:44.47]I'm not picking him up yet.
[18:46.13]You guys, this is... If I pick up somebody and, like, yeet him into the ocean, I'm gonna get negative god points.
[18:53.33]You want me to be good, not evil.
[19:03.47]Alright, do I need more wood?
[19:10.75]Yeet the non-believers.
[19:19.03]Oops.
[19:20.55]Oh, no, there we go.
[19:23.77]I don't know.
[19:24.75]It just takes time.
[19:25.49]It just takes time.
[19:30.19]There we go.
[19:31.93]What happened?
[19:32.45]Oh, they said, wow.
[19:36.26]There it is.
[19:38.84]They're trying the straw poll for good or evil.
[19:41.02]No, I'm going to decide there is no good, there is no good, and there is no evil.
[19:55.57]This game's called Black and White, I know.
[20:00.18]Fuck.
[20:02.52]Sometimes good people do evil things.
[20:04.52]Sometimes evil people do good things.
[20:08.82]Ray.
[20:09.08]Alright, let's go inside the temple.
[20:21.52]Incredible, the tribe built all this.
[20:25.74]No good or evil, only jacks.
[20:27.30]And a thing that's a monument to you as a god.
[20:31.14]And us as your conscience, don't forget.
[20:33.15]The workmanship is amazing.
[20:37.57]And what a symbol of overwhelming evil.
[20:39.47]Deaths in your region, births in your region.
[20:41.81]No it isn't.
[20:42.59]Sacrifices.
[20:43.05]Now look, this here must be a map of the whole land.
[20:47.70]What about all these doors?
[20:50.37]Each leads to a room.
[20:52.21]The rooms are extremely useful.
[20:55.79]Let's try some.
[20:58.45]Okay.
[20:59.88]I'm gonna take a look at this.
[21:01.00]Check out all the writing on the scroll, boss.
[21:03.44]Percentage that believe in you.
[21:05.16]It's showing lots of information about your followers and your villages.
[21:08.98]Unbelievable.
[21:09.86]Only 59 people live here.
[21:12.67]Yeah, look at this.
[21:14.19]Deaths in your region, births, number of sacrifices, buildings, wonders in your region, disciples in your realm, builders, breeders, fishermen, farmers, foresters, missionaries, craftsmen, traders.
[21:25.21]Alright, well, let's... Alright, that's cool.
[21:28.81]Let's take a look at the other rooms.
[21:35.67]This is the save game room.
[21:38.09]Okay.
[21:39.33]Here's the library, which I think is gonna have...
[21:43.56]Village help.
[21:44.00]Help with village life.
[21:44.84]Yeah, this is just extra documentation.
[21:47.76]You know, this is just documentation.
[22:05.14]What does this say?
[22:06.64]Story history.
[22:07.26]The evil conscience said the scrolls contain a whole bunch of useful information.
[22:10.42]One line ago, the good conscience said this is the library.
[22:13.31]Two lines ago, the good conscience said... Am I playing... Is this AI dungeon?
[22:16.07]This is a transcript of what everybody has said.
[22:29.15]It's a lore scroll.
[22:30.39]Alright, what else is in here?
[22:33.02]I don't remember.
[22:33.68]Challenge room.
[22:34.46]I think there's a creature cave.
[22:37.62]Game options.
[22:38.70]I don't want to touch that.
[22:40.14]The future room.
[22:43.83]What is, what is the, okay, the creature cave.
[22:46.93]Oh, this is an expansion thing, isn't it?
[22:50.31]Yeah, it is.
[22:52.29]Yeah, this is like an expansion room.
[22:55.00]What does the challenge room do?
[23:00.93]This game has like two expansions.
[23:03.27]Alright, so this is challenge room.
[23:05.53]Let's take a look.
[23:06.35]I'm just trying to get the info.
[23:08.84]There are no challenges right now.
[23:10.62]It's just a bunch of empty frames.
[23:29.53]Alright.
[23:30.57]It's time.
[23:31.71]It's time for the most important thing of the whole day.
[23:34.15]Because this does not change.
[23:37.03]By the way.
[23:37.41]I think we have to figure out what each one does.
[23:41.03]Daza, thank you.
[23:42.31]Daza for the 10 community subs.
[23:44.91]10 subs from Daza.
[23:46.07]Whoa.
[23:47.81]Thank you.
[23:52.23]The future is uncertain.
[23:56.41]Yeah?
[23:58.28]So what?
[24:06.67]More DLC.
[24:08.63]Yeah, I know, don't save.
[24:09.93]I'm not gonna save it.
[24:11.31]I've read... I've got all, like, the patches that I need.
[24:13.87]The game can only be saved when it auto-saves.
[24:18.94]Yeah.
[24:20.12]I will actually break it.
[24:34.80]Alright.
[24:35.56]Who do I want to be?
[24:37.54]It's tough.
[24:39.04]It's a hard choice.
[24:39.92]Not yet.

[28:09.29]Because that's what you're doing right now.
[28:11.61]This is one of the most classic fucking top 10 PC games ever existed.
[28:20.86]I mean, it might be like number nine and Half-Life might be like number two, right?
[28:24.36]Or whatever, but like, you know, come on.

[28:47.27]They'll see.
[28:47.71]They're doing it for the jokes.

[29:10.53]Yep.
[29:10.61]You can also drop trees and wooden objects into the village store as well as food from the fields or fish from the sea.
[29:19.72]Yes, so you can just drop food in here.
[29:21.50]I got it, okay?
[29:22.57]Relax.
[29:25.23]Did you know that signposts always contain useful information about the world?
[29:29.07]Once you've read them, their knowledge will appear in the library inside your temple.
[29:32.91]Yes.
[29:34.09]You can scroll through some of the info signs to read all the text.
[29:38.24]Using the action button.
[29:42.08]Oh, that's cool.
[29:42.82]That's right.
[29:43.40]Alright.
[29:43.98]Imagine if I didn't know that.
[29:45.40]Imagine ResidentSleeper in Half-Life 4.
[29:55.70]Did you know you can use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out?
[30:00.47]Yes, I know.
[30:01.38]Oh my god.
[30:25.43]You can use them.
[30:26.13]Yes, I know that.
[30:26.91]Yep, okay.
[30:27.65]Alright, we're good.
[30:34.84]I love this game, and I'm gonna play it.
[30:36.86]That's all that needs to be said.
[30:38.76]So... Alright, she won't... No, don't give it to them.
[30:43.00]Don't give it to them.
[30:44.28]Don't just pick somebody up and whip them into the ground.
[30:46.72]Don't do that.
[30:47.62]That's what they want.
[30:48.48]That's what they want you to do, and I'm not doing it.
[30:52.42]You could press the following key to show you the name.
[30:54.76]Oh, that's cool.
[30:59.46]And make tracking their movements easier.
[31:02.86]That's actually really, really good.
[31:04.08]Interesting.
[31:04.52]N. That didn't work.
[31:11.81]N?
[31:17.01]Yeah.
[31:17.71]N, right?
[31:21.08]No?
[31:21.82]Uh, I can't.
[31:22.30]It doesn't work.
[31:26.14]If you see a house with smoke coming out of it, it is occupied.
[31:28.87]Okay.
[31:29.95]To eject the occupants, tap the house.
[31:34.71]Oh, did I just do that?
[31:37.39]Oh no, there's nobody living here.
[31:40.47]Let's try somebody.
[31:40.97]People are in the house and green people would show free spaces.
[31:43.65]Alright, well get out.
[31:46.71]Get out!
[31:47.79]I think it's the tutorial, that's why I can't do it.
[31:58.05]That's cool.
[31:58.33]Alright, read this one.
[32:01.41]Placing a man or woman next to someone of the opposite sex turns them into a disciple breeder whose only goal is to breed and produce children.
[32:17.11]Oh.
[32:25.58]Drop.
[32:33.03]So we have breeders.
[32:33.93]Okay, we got breeders.
[32:38.07]Somebody... I keep hearing like a sniper rifle in the distance.
[32:41.14]It's like freaking me out.
[32:43.64]You can plant forests by picking up a tree and placing it upright in the ground.
[32:47.74]That's cool.
[32:48.68]If you place a tree in a village, it becomes a scenic addition and will please your people.
[32:52.53]Foresters will not cut these trees down.
[32:54.55]Alright, that's good to know.
[32:58.13]We're almost there.
[32:58.99]We're almost there.
[33:03.13]Every time you activate a gold story scroll, you start the next chapter.
[33:05.93]Okay.
[33:07.63]Alright, let's... Okay, here we go.
[33:09.33]I just... I wanted to get that info.
[33:12.42]I have.
[33:12.62]I have.
[33:27.40]Creatures.
[33:29.23]Behind them are three wondrous creatures.
[33:31.47]That's right.
[33:32.07]Every god has a creature.
[33:33.57]Every god has a creature.
[33:34.37]They can grow tall as a mountain and can perform miracles.
[33:36.89]Mm-hm.
[33:37.45]But you can't open the gate unless you find the three gate stones.
[33:40.70]Mm-hm.
[33:41.36]Each stone you find must be placed on this platform.
[33:44.02]I'll get them.
[33:49.52]Throw her into the ocean.
[33:50.86]No.
[33:51.64]The villagers were dancing around the gate stone when you arrived.
[33:54.43]No.
[33:58.89]Once you place this gate stone on the platform, I will tell you of the other two.
[34:02.41]Throw the ocean into her.
[34:05.80]Now, retrieve the first gate stone, Holy One.
[34:11.30]Okay.
[34:13.26]Let's go get the gate stone.
[34:16.90]It was over, where was it?
[34:17.80]Over here, right?
[34:19.87]It was like on the beach.
[34:25.21]Who lives here?
[34:32.28]Where was it?
[34:33.86]Wasn't it like when I first got here, right?
[34:35.88]It's like right here, right?
[34:37.74]Yeah, it's right here.
[34:38.42]Here's the stone the people were dancing around.
[34:40.80]Pick it up by clicking the action button on it.
[34:43.72]And drop it on someone's house.
[34:46.47]To please all the people resident sleepering Half-Life 1.
[34:50.43]Get it?
[35:11.79]Drop it on her.
[35:12.91]I'll find it.
[35:13.45]Easy.
[35:14.11]Ooh, that's not a scroll.
[35:15.21]That's a moon.
[35:15.65]Alright, we're looking for a gold scroll.
[35:18.60]Anybody see a gold scroll here?
[35:20.68]Mm-hmm.
[35:46.16]What's going on here?
[35:51.32]Oh, holy one.
[35:52.70]I kneel before you.
[35:56.25]Nerd neck.
[35:58.83]My brother, suffering a fever, has left his sickbed and become lost.
[36:03.03]Alright, we're gonna find the lost.
[36:09.41]He's so weak.
[36:10.82]I'm frightened he'll die.
[36:12.68]I must find him.
[36:17.47]If you find him and bring him home, I'll give you one of the three gate stones.
[36:22.15]It's in my house.
[36:24.39]Hey, I got a plan.
[36:28.45]Why don't we trash the house?
[36:30.83]We can get the gate stone that way.
[36:33.09]I heartily object.
[36:34.66]That's just malicious.
[36:36.24]Well, that's kind of the whole point.
[36:40.54]The lost brother is in some trees through the pass.
[37:01.46]Fields are where you people plant crops.
[37:04.84]Which are then harvested and carried to the store.
[37:06.84]Yes.
[37:07.48]To add to the food pile, you can harvest crops yourself.
[37:11.44]As can your creature.
[37:12.58]You can also make dedicated farmer disciples by placing villagers in these fields.
[37:19.18]Trash the house.
[37:20.06]No.
[37:22.16]If I'm God right now, I go find the... Yeah.
[37:32.17]I didn't see the sixth skipper route.
[37:34.80]Oh, there goes the skipping God Hand!
[37:38.86]On his way!
[37:39.59]Where is he?
[38:02.60]No, I can't let them dictate what I'm going to do as me.
[38:07.64]I'm bringing them back.
[38:08.48]Do as we command.
[38:34.37]That's the title of the stream.
[38:37.53]Do you want me to go against the title of my own damn stream?
[38:50.77]Now steal.
[38:54.42]Alright, you want me to drop this on somebody and watch them explode?
[38:56.54]Is that what you want?
[38:57.10]Is that what you seriously want me to do?
[39:02.76]Yes!
[39:06.14]And everyone calls me the psycho.
[39:07.64]Holy shit, Jervis, psycho.
[39:11.10]I crushed that guy.
[39:14.48]Good.
[39:15.04]You have two of the gate stones.
[39:16.86]But the third could be a problem.
[39:18.82]The villagers say the final one was destroyed eons ago.
[39:22.20]All is not lost, though.
[39:23.60]The village sculptor can carve a new gate stone for you.
[39:26.44]You should see him.
[39:27.42]Alright.
[39:28.18]Village sculptor.
[39:32.82]What do you got?
[39:35.78]That's not big enough.
[39:36.95]It's gotta be way bigger.
[39:37.81]Burn the gate down.
[39:39.55]Okay.
[39:39.73]Smash!
[39:39.95]I can't- I'm not gonna smash and kill people in the tutorial.
[40:07.55]Alright, there it is.
[40:11.79]Go get the big rock.
[40:14.53]That's why you can't die.
[40:15.67]You want me to kill the best sculptor in the village?
[40:25.04]Why would I do that?
[40:26.94]Oh, pick up rock and throw rock into people.
[40:29.28]Okay, yeah, that's fun.
[40:31.56]There's no going back if I do that, you understand?
[40:40.18]Alright, where was it?
[40:40.76]Over here?
[40:46.06]Where was it?
[40:46.50]Right here?
[40:52.86]I thought it was right over here.
[40:54.24]Wasn't it right there?
[40:58.46]Over here?
[41:01.05]Where's this rock?
[41:03.11]Where is it?
[41:04.23]I can't even go this way.
[41:05.97]The Old Hermit's Quarry.
[41:07.35]Yeah, well wasn't that, like, right here?
[41:14.64]That's not... I thought it was right here.
[41:27.78]Um... Which one?
[41:30.98]Does it matter?
[41:44.70]I can't pick this up.
[41:47.72]This can't be moved.
[41:52.55]Um... Is this what it... No, it needs to be bigger than that.
[42:01.03]How do I... I can't move these.
[42:03.07]Maybe does it matter?
[42:05.81]Here, use this one.
[42:15.24]I guess this is big enough.
[42:17.68]Here.
[42:21.84]Right, that's big enough.
[42:23.88]Are you fucking serious?
[42:28.41]Why?
[42:29.77]No, no, no.
[42:31.95]Oh, shit.
[42:32.47]No, no, no.
[42:33.25]Cat.
[42:33.61]I want to pick him up.
[42:40.63]Now you believe, huh?
[42:42.23]Now you all start to believe.
[43:00.88]You know, I didn't believe in that god until he bowling balled that rock down the cliff.
[43:04.92]Alright, so why can't I pick up... Like, I don't... I want to pick it up.
[43:09.83]Am I insane, or is it like this one?
[43:19.89]Yeah, it's this one, right?
[43:21.87]No.
[43:24.85]Keep going?
[43:29.71]Nothing else here.
[43:31.70]It's up the hill.
[43:43.14]Left.
[43:43.54]Left.
[43:43.96]Left.
[43:44.38]Up here.
[43:44.76]Found it.
[43:53.21]If you press F1 when your hand is over something, information on it will be displayed.
[43:56.93]Alright.
[43:57.89]Let's see.
[43:58.37]Gate stone.
[44:04.31]Alright, I actually have to be careful.
[44:08.49]I don't want to kill anybody accidentally.
[44:09.58]Alright, let's do this.
[44:10.26]There you go.
[44:17.50]Here's the stone you need.
[44:19.60]Yeah, I know, I just put it down.
[44:21.06]That's excellent.
[44:22.20]Exactly the right kind of rock to work with.
[44:24.80]Thank you.
[44:25.84]Come back later and I'll have it finished.
[44:30.53]Come back later?
[44:32.03]How much later?
[44:32.79]What am I supposed to do in the meantime?
[44:44.06]Well, hurry up.
[44:47.90]I don't got all day.
[44:48.94]I don't have time for this.
[44:54.62]Oops.
[44:56.52]Go back to work.
[44:59.11]Breed with... Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[45:01.17]Let's breed.
[45:02.69]Oh, this person's already breeding.
[45:06.57]How much breeding... I say some are jigging about on here.
[45:10.39]What?
[45:13.91]This village is just chillin'.
[45:15.79]Alright, hold on.
[45:17.37]People are just having sex with each other and stuff.
[45:20.01]What is going on?
[45:23.31]This village is just chillin'.
[45:25.11]Hold on.
[45:27.37]Wait, what?
[45:29.89]That lady was already pregnant.
[45:41.00]I don't understand.
[45:42.92]Alright, let's go.
[45:48.70]The gate stones are together.
[45:50.33]Pass through and claim your creature.
[45:52.35]Oh, because that's a resident breeder?
[45:57.27]What?
[45:58.69]So, hold on.
[46:00.47]Did I designate that person to be just a breeder?
[46:03.11]Resident...
[46:12.66]Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go!
[46:28.49]There they are, there they are!
[46:29.35]You see them?
[46:29.91]Look at the corner, do you see?
[46:34.01]I don't see them, I don't see what you're talking about.
[46:35.70]Oh, I see them!
[46:46.67]Look at them.
[46:47.49]Just look at them.
[46:49.06]These are miraculous creatures indeed.
[46:51.92]They certainly are, but not quite as big as I expected.
[46:56.36]Not yet, maybe.
[46:58.00]But they can become the most powerful creatures in the world.
[47:02.56]Now, that I'd like to see.
[47:04.32]We must have one.
[47:05.76]Which should we choose?
[47:06.88]Hey, they're all special.
[47:10.33]That makes me like the monkey.
[47:12.85]Hearing that, like, that makes me like the monkey.
[47:15.65]But, oh, we do have Nerd Neck Tiger.
[47:18.85]You know what I mean?
[47:19.99]Like, this is a hard choice.
[47:24.52]There's Nerd Neck Tiger, there's Funny Monkey, and then there's just absolutely just... I don't even know what you call it.
[47:31.85]It's Superhero Cow.
[47:39.55]Good luck.
[47:39.91]You have to pick.
[47:40.59]It's not going to be up to me.
[47:49.96]They all have their own personalities, by the way.
[48:00.52]Monkey, tiger, cow.
[48:06.31]This is a really important choice.
[48:07.67]Okay, let's see what you guys do.
[48:20.38]I'm going to put them on the screen in full HD so you can see what they all do.
[48:37.66]Oh, come on!
[48:38.32]You don't look at... Did you just... SuperHeroCow just did a split for you.
[48:42.35]That was very impressive.
[48:45.39]Whoa, boy!
[48:46.67]And SuperHeroCow, unfortunately, is gonna lose.
[48:51.82]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[48:53.20]That's unfortunate.
[48:54.34]I just...
[48:56.96]Ah, monkey is gonna win.
[48:59.62]I can't believe it.
[49:03.80]The cow just did a fucking split.
[49:11.89]You have to feed him?
[49:13.29]I have to feed him.
[49:14.49]I have to feed him.
[49:17.01]I have to feed him.
[49:20.73]What?
[49:21.33]Not the fierce, lethal tiger.
[49:23.69]Hit the action button on him.
[49:27.40]Oh, what was that?
[49:30.60]I, like, like you now.
[49:31.88]Because you just did, like, the cat puke noise.
[49:34.56]Okay, cat puke.
[49:35.58]I like the tiger now.
[49:36.68]Um... I want the cow.
[49:43.93]I want the cow.
[49:44.89]I don't care.
[49:45.39]No democracy today.
[49:46.37]Oh, but he's laughing at me.
[49:58.06]What about the ape?
[49:59.46]Intelligent and quick to learn.
[50:01.58]You can't change this.
[50:03.78]Oh, just a nose split.
[50:11.35]We've chosen a creature.
[50:12.71]He was surprised.
[50:23.73]The guy was surprised by this.
[50:29.48]He's like, holy shit, it actually worked.
[50:40.23]You're a dictator.
[50:41.97]I had to.
[50:42.91]This is your creature's new home.
[50:46.14]He's small at the moment, but look after him and one day he'll be big and powerful.
[50:55.92]He isn't comfortable in his new home yet.
[50:57.72]In fact, he's a little frightened.
[51:03.86]You can stroke him to reassure him.
[51:06.84]Let's pet cow.
[51:08.30]Can you pet cow?
[51:09.25]Yes.
[51:09.45]Click and hold the action button, then move your hand to stroke him.
[51:17.23]and moving your hand over him gently.
[51:19.97]Stroking tells him you approve of him, and it makes him happy.
[51:25.77]Okay, let's scratch his belly.
[51:30.17]So I'm not trying to do that.
[51:34.47]I'm going really slow.
[51:47.07]Alright, good boy!
[51:51.99]Oh, okay.
[51:54.07]He's gonna pog.
[51:54.89]Did he pog?
[51:55.23]Where you going?
[52:15.21]1% damage?
[52:16.19]Fuck.
[52:16.47]Alright, let's see.
[52:19.63]This is your creature's home.
[52:20.63]He feels safe here, and when he rests, he'll grow in size faster.
[52:24.31]That's right, they get fucking huge.
[52:26.49]You can place interesting things in the pen for your creature, and inside the temple is a creature's cave full of useful statistics about him.
[52:39.19]Look at that side eye.
[52:41.73]Yeah, okay, so we can get him toys and stuff.
[52:43.67]What else can I do?
[52:45.45]Spacebar is a shortcut key to place your camera... Get out of here.
[52:52.39]The spacebar is a shortcut key to place your camera in a safe position.
[52:56.19]Press it again to return you to the temple.
[52:59.18]Pressing it again will return you to original... Alright, so if I go like... I see, okay.
[53:06.22]So you can just like... You can have it focus and shit.
[53:11.57]Safe, I guess.
[53:13.63]Okay, I see.
[53:17.52]What do you want?
[53:19.80]Is he laughing?
[53:23.47]Oh no, he's going, hey, over there.
[53:24.87]Hey, you, go over there.
[53:27.19]Oh, I love him.
[53:30.33]His voice is kind of annoying.
[53:36.32]Your creature is getting hungry.
[53:39.78]I suggest you find him something to eat.
[53:46.01]Do they eat people?
[53:48.59]Do they eat people?
[53:51.85]Alright, we're gonna find food.
[53:56.27]What do you like to eat?
[54:00.55]Hunger, 100%.
[54:02.23]Tiredness.
[54:03.59]Alright, hungry.
[54:04.53]What do we eat?
[54:06.21]If you want a creature to eat something, rub his tummy when you give it to him.
[54:09.51]He'll eat it even if he's not hungry.
[54:15.72]Okay, um... Does he eat people?
[54:19.78]I don't know if you should eat people.
[54:21.74]Does he eat wood?
[54:22.50]Wait, there's a reward scroll.
[54:23.77]Let's see what it...
[54:34.90]Okay, let's get our projectile skills up to scratch.
[54:39.10]What do you suggest?
[54:40.57]I presume it involves killing?
[54:42.71]No, not at all.
[54:44.37]I was going to propose... We... I know.
[54:49.11]Let's see if we can hit that pillar over there.
[54:52.17]It's a test of our godly powers.
[54:54.69]And nobody gets hurt.
[54:56.47]How nice.
[54:57.77]And I guess we use this everlasting pile of stones.
[55:01.53]Hmm, handy that.
[55:04.73]Move your hand over a rock.
[55:06.75]This is teaching how to throw.
[55:07.87]Press the action button until the rock is in your hand.
[55:11.16]I'm going to knock down the rock.
[55:12.34]Hold down the action button.
[55:15.02]Put momentum on the throw by moving the hand in the correct direction.
[55:19.68]So you can actually... Throw the rock by releasing the action button.
[55:22.66]Yeah.
[55:23.56]Try throwing a rock now.
[55:24.86]There we go.
[55:32.64]Okay, I need a little bit more.
[55:34.48]Not enough weight behind that one.
[55:36.90]Oh, now that was close.
[55:42.35]Hey, I saw that.
[55:51.03]You missed the pillar by miles.
[55:52.65]Hey, I saw that.
[55:56.03]You missed the pillar by miles.
[55:58.94]I'm sorry.
[55:59.88]I'm sorry.
[56:00.24]I'm sorry.
[56:00.68]Go back to work.
[56:41.33]Okay.
[56:49.11]Feed cow.
[56:50.25]I will feed the cow.
[56:51.29]Just wait.
[56:53.50]That hit.
[56:55.96]What, I have to hit the top thing off?
[57:00.06]Oh my god, this is gonna... I know.
[57:07.60]Holy shit, that was too fast.
[57:16.13]Oh, now that was close.
[57:23.92]Oh my god, this is hard.
[57:26.28]Oh, now that was close.
[57:37.48]Dude, alright.
[57:38.06]The cow's starving.
[57:38.64]The cow's gonna be fine.
[57:39.32]Give me this food.
[57:39.89]Ooh, it's a toy!
[57:41.15]It's a toy for the cow.
[57:42.29]Awesome.
[57:42.95]Alright, look what I got.
[57:43.67]I know you're hungry, but look.
[58:10.50]Where are you?
[58:10.86]There you are.
[58:11.32]Look at this.
[58:12.30]Uh... Hey, you!

[58:42.24]What is this?
[58:46.10]What is this?
[58:47.00]Is this a... I don't know what this is.
[58:49.44]There's a silver reward scroll on the beach behind those huge gates.
[59:02.45]He seemed to like that.
[59:04.45]Try feeding him some more.
[59:06.11]I'll be back later.
[59:07.50]Oh no, now he has an insufferable just lust for food.
[59:13.94]Here, play with this.

[59:45.61]I was rubbing his tummy.
[59:46.66]I was rubbing his... I was rubbing his tummy.
[59:50.40]It said rub tummy.
[59:51.90]It said... It said rub tummy for food stuff.
[59:56.74]Alright, let's go.
[60:07.99]Alright, where's the silver scroll?
[60:15.70]Silver reward scroll.
[60:17.18]Where was it?
[60:22.12]I don't remember where it was.
[60:30.88]Oh, fuck.
[60:33.16]Who's this motherfucker?
[60:38.30]Oh no, it's a rival god.
[60:41.76]It's spying on my base.
[60:43.28]Alright, he's spying on my base.
[60:44.82]I need to... Your creature already has his own personality.
[60:58.80]What is his personality?
[61:00.70]But you can alter and shape it by... What's going on?
[61:04.06]Oh, I thought he was going to eat her.
[61:05.76]What the...
[61:08.94]Punish your creature to stop him doing things like that.
[61:11.33]I thought I was gonna eat her.
[61:14.45]Oh, that just gets shit out of me.
[61:18.65]Punish?
[61:25.96]Hold down the action button over the creature to zoom in on him.
[61:31.50]Now slap him by moving your hand quickly from side to side across him.
[61:35.22]Good job.
[61:35.92]Good work.
[61:37.57]Oops.
[61:39.47]I just accidentally... Oh, you want to encourage him to do things like that, do you?
[61:51.27]Well, it's up to you.
[61:52.97]I'll return when your creature is behaving a bit better.
[61:55.57]He's like, ha ha!
[61:57.69]Ha ha!
[61:59.67]I can do those things, Dad doesn't even care.

[63:24.76]Eat.
[63:26.20]Eat.
[63:35.80]It says rub his belly to make him want to eat.
[63:47.52]Stop playing and eat.
[63:50.12]You're gonna lose the ball.
[63:51.46]I'm not gonna get it.
[63:52.15]I'm not getting it for you if you lose it.
[63:54.95]Yeah, you can't even hit it.

[64:03.56]Eat!
[64:03.64]That's the stomach!
[64:33.29]Why?
[64:33.51]He thought about that.
[64:34.31]He had, like, a moral conflict there.
[64:35.99]What was that?
[64:40.28]That was weird.
[64:42.22]That was weird.
[64:43.78]Okay.
[64:45.58]Yeah, but I... Hold on.
[64:47.78]Where's the silver scroll?
[64:49.16]On the beach.

[67:00.54]Should I throw a boulder at him?
[67:08.29]What does this one say?
[67:09.69]Silver reward scrolls are not vital.
[67:11.57]Yeah, I know that.
[67:12.55]You can throw in different ways.
[67:15.56]A long, smooth throw sends the missile low along the ground, and a quick hand move release will throw the object higher.
[67:21.08]Yeah.
[67:24.02]Alright, let's go do this.
[67:24.70]Okay.

[73:19.92]Double click the action button to attach the leash.
[73:26.97]Attach your creature to that sparkly tree.
[73:46.69]With the leash attached to your creature, double click on the tree.
[73:50.37]Why did he do that?
[73:51.53]Double click the action button to attach the leash.
[73:54.19]It wasn't funny.
[73:55.47]It's not funny.
[73:56.21]It is funny.
[73:56.88]Fucking who cares?
[73:58.66]He leaned out and did this dance.
[74:01.16]Okay, whatever.
[74:06.22]Good.
[74:07.02]The leash is very useful.
[74:08.82]Your creature is tied to the tree now.
[74:10.47]You can interact with whatever he's leashed to as well.
[74:13.25]Okay.
[74:15.06]If you click on a leash when the creature's attached to something, you can adjust its length.
[74:20.44]He did it like four times in a row.
[74:23.95]This is the leash of aggression.
[74:25.95]It encourages your creature to get angry.
[74:27.85]Encourages aggression?
[74:31.01]This is the fluffy leash of compassion.
[74:33.57]It makes your creature behave nicely.
[74:37.25]Why not experiment with these leashes?
[74:39.51]They're powerful tools.
[74:41.29]I'll bid you farewell.
[74:42.84]You now know as much about creatures as I do.
[74:45.04]One thing remains.
[74:47.54]Legends tell of an ancient creature somewhere on this land.
[74:50.12]Yeah, we've seen him already.
[74:50.82]I've heard him, but I've never seen him.
[74:53.08]He hides from us humans, but he has great knowledge, I think.
[74:56.17]It's a giant sheep.
[74:57.61]Hey Miniclips, thanks for the five subs.
[75:01.27]Appreciate it.
[75:04.05]It's the sniper.
[75:09.39]There are advanced techniques for using the leash.
[75:12.58]Find them on this signpost.
[75:16.82]No, you can't go that way.
[75:19.05]Alright.
[75:22.25]Don't do it.
[75:23.95]Oh my fucking god, he ate her!
[75:39.87]Can we not get quests anymore?
[75:44.69]That was bad.
[75:47.39]No, that wasn't good.
[75:48.65]Not funny.
[75:49.49]Not funny.
[75:50.15]Don't do that.
[75:52.35]Not funny.
[75:53.35]Here, let me just... I don't want to... Is there any way I can scold him?
[76:02.88]How do you scold?
[76:04.38]I don't want to...
[76:07.69]There's only one way you can do that, and it's like, alright, he's... He's gonna start to become unbearable, you know what I mean?
[76:14.63]Like, he's gonna eat quest givers and shit.
[76:16.69]I don't know if we can handle this.
[76:20.29]Don't do that, that's... I'm... I'm... Okay, I just didn't... Alright, alright, alright.
[76:30.01]Oh, fuck!
[76:31.91]Oh, I don't want to do that!
[76:33.87]Alright, you can restrict the area in which you creature...
[76:40.29]Jesus Christ!
[76:53.63]First, uh, what is he doing?
[76:57.77]You can restrict the area in which your creature can move when he's on the leash.
[77:00.29]First you attach the leash to an object and... Okay.
[77:03.30]That's area restricting.
[77:08.26]He's thinking about what?
[77:13.91]Look, this motherfucker just ate the quest giver, okay?
[77:25.92]Alright.
[77:26.74]Click on, uh, click on... Alright, we're fine.
[77:29.76]Pull to stretch the... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[77:31.92]First you attach the leash to an object, then click the action button anymore on the leash to pick it up.
[77:35.21]Okay.
[77:35.83]You can pull to stretch the leash to the length you want it to be.
[77:39.51]I see.
[77:41.35]So you can do... Okay, that makes sense.
[77:44.16]Alright, let's go find... You're encouraging him to eat people.
[77:52.93]The second she was done talking Did you know The creature pen is where you'll find your creatures leashes you can also use differently just to directly influence your creatures mood There is the leash of learning
[78:15.44]Which makes your creature mimic your own action.
[78:18.22]The leash of aggression.
[78:20.00]Which will make him angry and the leash of compassion.
[78:22.30]So he's on the leash of learning right now.
[78:23.74]Does he want to sleep out there?
[78:25.54]Let's get rid of the leash.
[78:29.17]Come here.
[78:35.05]Go to bed.
[78:40.55]How does he have to have that, like, big-ass bruise?
[78:43.93]Like, I didn't even want to do that.
[78:45.55]Alright.
[78:47.71]Go to bed.
[78:52.76]Good.
[78:53.20]Okay.
[78:58.18]So I got the leash of learning on right now.
[79:01.90]Alright.
[79:03.22]Here we go.
[79:06.07]I know.
[79:06.75]There's a bunch of reward squirrels.
[79:08.39]Everywhere.
[79:09.03]There's one here, too.
[79:12.36]Remember, he ate a person.
[79:13.60]I know.
[79:15.22]It was an important person, too.
[79:16.47]Please find my strange sheep.
[79:36.79]Well, they were going to be slaughtered anyway.
[79:39.51]I say we waste the wandering mutton.
[79:42.62]But if we find and return them, we'll have a dyed-in-the-wool follower.
[79:47.18]Wow, the saintly one made a joke.
[79:53.52]What is that?
[79:53.96]Ooh.
[79:54.46]Okay, so we're going to find a sheep.
[79:58.98]Found one.
[80:01.53]Alright, here.
[80:03.07]Is this what you're looking for?
[80:05.72]There's one right there, right?
[80:08.06]Many thanks, Higher Power.
[80:09.70]Keep them coming, please.
[80:11.58]Well... It's your problem.
[80:13.76]This is your problem.
[80:17.89]What is this place?
[80:19.61]Did you know children stay safely in the Creech until they reach adulthood?
[80:23.71]The Creech is a settlement that encourages people to have more children.
[80:27.75]Alright, so this is like a little daycare?
[80:29.99]Alright, makes sense.
[80:36.11]If you drop a person by a job, they'll become a disciple and do that job indefinitely until you stop them by picking them up and shaking your hand to release them.
[80:42.66]Okay.
[80:45.10]You can create as many disciples as you like.
[80:49.50]Shake your hand when you've got the leash and you release it, right?
[80:51.74]You can leash your creature to any object by double-clicking the action button on the object.
[80:56.22]Pressing this key attaches the leash to your creature.
[80:59.46]Right.
[81:00.16]Oh, what is he doing?
[81:06.10]Why are you going over here?
[81:13.16]Not over by the children.
[81:15.20]Not by the children.
[81:16.12]He's on the loose.
[81:22.92]What's he doing?
[81:23.72]He's just sprinting around.
[81:25.56]He's completely, completely out of control.
[81:29.98]I mean, he's not doing anything.

[83:16.99]I don't even know what to do with you anymore.
[83:43.23]He was thirsty.
[83:48.79]Alright.
[83:49.93]Please be good.
[83:50.63]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.

[84:14.22]There was another scroll.
[84:15.08]Where was it?
[84:16.46]Okay, there's this right here.
[84:20.20]Mm-hmm.
[84:20.44]Okay.
[84:20.60]Mm-hmm.
[84:42.80]Look at the size of that.
[84:46.04]Ah, okay.
[84:46.79]We're dead.
[84:47.87]We're all dead.
[84:49.69]What is it?
[84:50.63]Where's it from?
[84:51.91]It doesn't seem to be aggressive, though.
[84:54.35]If it is, we're all dead.
[84:56.53]Even our spirits.
[84:57.61]Dead, you told us.
[85:00.59]Can you hear that?
[85:02.27]This giant is communicating.
[85:04.81]It's telepathic.
[85:06.45]You have a creature.
[85:07.95]Bring him to me.
[85:09.53]Oh, no.
[85:10.11]No way!
[85:11.31]He'll eat him!
[85:12.47]But this giant looks friendly.
[85:14.83]Let's bring our creature over with the leash.
[85:17.21]I am not proud of my son, so I don't know if I'm gonna like this.
[85:21.35]Please, use the leash to bring your creature to me.
[85:24.74]I mean, this is really... What if he just starts farting and kicking things and eating people in front of him?
[85:34.48]It's gonna be really embarrassing.
[85:37.81]There you are.
[85:38.37]Alright, come here.
[85:39.35]Come with me.
[85:50.32]Over this way.
[85:54.22]He must be judged.
[86:02.32]Derva hates him already.
[86:03.64]I don't ha- I think he's funny.
[86:08.61]But he's not wholesome.
[86:11.78]He's just mean and weird.
[86:15.64]Alright, don't embarrass me.
[86:17.86]This is an important weird god interview.
[86:23.60]Don't embarrass me.
[86:24.33]Oi.
[86:43.50]Another creature?
[86:44.94]Is it true?
[86:46.21]Are you real?
[86:48.45]I've been alone for eons.
[86:50.17]I thought I would die without ever seeing another god.
[86:55.15]Or another creature.
[86:58.46]I once belonged to Nemesis, the most powerful of gods.
[87:05.02]But his power kept growing, and soon I wasn't bold enough for him.
[87:10.59]So I was cast out, banished here, and I've been alone ever since.
[87:17.05]Until now.
[87:18.52]Well, you just... I'm not hiring.
[87:21.78]This being is astonishing, but what a sad tale.
[87:25.62]In return for your friendship and that of your creature, I will teach you both.
[87:31.99]You will both learn the ways of the gods.
[87:37.67]When you are ready for the first lesson, meet me at the village through this path.
[87:41.81]There's another village.
[87:48.69]He's like, wait, where are you going?
[88:00.08]I wanna go see the big guy again.
[88:04.82]I'm gonna let him do it.
[88:05.62]He needs to learn.
[88:06.20]He's gotta be on his own.
[88:15.64]He's so dopey.
[88:25.33]Should I be bringing him over here?
[88:39.52]Maybe I shouldn't even be doing this.
[88:45.30]Jerma, I fucking hate this cow so much.
[88:49.54]Well, I'm sorry, but this is our child right now.
[88:54.12]So, it's too bad.
[88:56.12]Wait, you don't want to go over there?
[89:04.31]No, no, no, no.
[89:06.17]Come on.
[89:06.55]Let's go.
[89:08.87]Follow me.
[89:11.71]There he is.
[89:12.05]Alright, now let's learn.
[89:17.45]This cow is better than Bugleberry.
[89:25.82]Oh boy.
[89:26.26]I can see that.
[89:29.34]Alright, here we are.
[89:33.14]This is the Aztec village.
[89:35.52]I will teach you the first secret here.
[89:38.19]It's not gonna be like, burn it down.
[89:39.73]These people do not yet believe in you as a god.
[89:43.91]to grow in power you and your creature can impress them until they believe in you look at the village store the flag shows that they need food if you give them some they'll think it's a miracle and will believe in you more click on the signpost to find out more about desire flags yeah they need food and yeah alright I got some extra food
[90:18.07]Imagine if the cow just turned over, picked him up, and ate him.
[90:23.04]Food miracle.
[90:23.92]Ow.
[90:47.12]What animal is that?
[90:49.06]I hear that all the time in random animal sounds.
[90:53.44]What's that like?
[90:58.82]What is that?
[90:59.24]I need to know exactly what that animal is.
[91:02.34]I hear it all the time.
[91:08.24]If your creature is on the rope leash, he'll learn this miracle when you cast it.
[91:15.66]Alright, so this is the teaching one.
[91:16.64]Okay.
[91:16.78]Let's get a leash on you so you learn this.
[91:18.14]Yes.
[91:18.34]Ah.
[91:52.48]I can't be on a leash.
[91:53.30]Didn't it say if he's on a leash to... I thought it said he'll learn it if he's on a leash.
[92:01.12]Come here.
[92:02.34]Get over here.
[92:03.34]Stop chasing stuff.
[92:05.21]What is that?
[92:05.59]Is it a bird?
[92:06.11]Oh, he's eating... Okay, he's eating things.
[92:09.41]Come here.
[92:12.81]No, stop sleeping.
[92:13.93]Why are you sleeping?
[92:15.49]Get... I just casted the miracle on the ground over here.
[92:20.79]I'm trying to get him to move.
[92:24.16]Get over here.
[92:24.76]Let's go.
[92:25.24]What an embarrassment.
[92:39.08]Alright.
[92:39.56]They believe.
[92:41.02]That's a lot more.
[92:41.86]Never mind.
[92:46.74]Look at him.
[92:47.10]He's like sizing them up.
[92:48.52]Not only have you fed them, but now they believe in you more.
[92:53.09]I have created more food miracles for you to practice with.
[92:57.63]At the village center, you can see your symbol.
[93:01.16]When it reaches the stone hand there, the village will believe in you.
[93:05.64]My symbol?
[93:06.92]Holding your hand over it shows how much belief the people have in you.
[93:12.56]I need sleep.
[93:13.96]Wake me when the village believes in you and you are ready to continue your education.
[93:18.58]Okay.
[93:19.94]When it reaches the stone.
[93:21.04]Alright, cool.
[93:21.67]So let's make them believe.
[93:25.61]He just lies on the ground over here.
[93:27.27]Alright, should I drop a rock in his head?
[93:29.13]Alright, I'm gonna throw a huge rock and drop it on his head.
[93:32.27]Should I do that?
[93:32.79]Alright, let them sleep.
[93:39.05]They can just hang out.
[93:39.69]I'm gonna do some more food miracles.
[93:48.73]You really want me to do the side quests.
[93:50.37]I know you do.
[93:52.39]Hold on.
[94:13.89]Alright, they believe in me now.
[94:14.91]Good.
[94:15.13]Uh, villages are impressed by the actions of gods, especially when they fulfill the people's desires.
[94:21.09]Do impressive things like throwing objects around, use creatures in the village, and cast miracles.
[94:25.07]You'll see... You will see the belief in.
[94:28.45]Alright, let's get some, uh... Let's get some, uh... You did the builder.
[94:38.09]Disciple Forester.
[94:40.41]Disciple Forester.
[94:41.83]Alright, let's have some... How many people live in this village?
[94:44.29]Can I tell?
[94:44.71]This is the village center.
[94:47.45]Placing your hand over it will show how much belief is needed before the village is yours.
[94:51.97]As you do impressive things in the village, you will see numbers come up over the villager.
[94:54.89]This is the amount of belief you have gained for your actions.
[94:57.55]That's right.
[94:58.73]I need 199 belief before this village is mine.
[95:02.00]So... Where'd he go?
[95:06.52]Where'd he go?
[95:26.96]Where is he?
[95:33.58]Oh.
[95:35.42]Uh... How do I locate my creature?
[95:40.72]Did he go home?
[95:41.29]Oh, shit.

[98:21.65]Quick, quick, quick.
[98:25.73]Drop it.
[98:26.79]Good job.
[98:27.69]Save him.
[98:35.26]Alright, do it again.
[98:36.54]Back up.
[98:42.52]One more.
[98:45.18]Alright, go!
[98:57.67]Nice job, you did it!
[98:59.31]You actually did something good.
[99:00.51]I'm starting to like you.
[99:12.15]At least some survived.
[99:13.75]We're a little thankful for that.
[99:16.51]I'm refreshed and ready to start teaching your little creature more.
[99:24.70]He's out of control.
[99:27.56]I'm sorry.
[99:29.50]At least he did a three.
[99:32.04]At least he did three.
[99:34.54]He may have snapped a person in half, but he did three out of four.
[99:41.27]Alright, we have to go teach him some more things.
[99:50.48]He's using the tree now.
[99:51.54]That's actually interesting.
[99:53.30]Why is he using the tree?
[99:55.72]What about her?
[99:56.52]What about him?
[99:59.04]What's your problem?
[100:01.10]He doesn't like you.
[100:02.37]Why do you- You don't like- Why?
[100:04.13]What's his face?
[100:05.85]Did you see that?
[100:06.91]Look at that frown.
[100:11.59]Alright, we'll have to go back to the big sheep.
[100:16.20]He's hungry.
[100:17.66]Alright, well, let me get him some food.
[100:22.36]He's just... Oh, he's going home.
[100:27.34]Alright, let's give him some food.
[100:28.28]He needs to eat something.
[100:33.38]We need like a pig or something, or a sheep.
[100:38.65]Alright, he's just... I know where... I can follow him later.
[100:41.22]He's just doing his own fucking thing, whatever.
[100:43.24]There's a silver reward scroll on the beach behind those huge gates.
[100:47.56]Um... We need a sheep.
[100:50.41]Or a cow.
[100:50.93]Alright, who cares about that?
[100:54.95]We'll just be this... Here.
[101:00.58]Come here.
[101:06.87]There.
[101:08.25]Oh, I'm sorry.
[101:09.17]I just heard him.
[101:11.85]Go get this.
[101:12.97]Come here.
[101:13.25]Oh, he doesn't know what to do.
[101:23.45]Good.
[101:24.41]Didn't like that.
[101:24.99]Alright, let's go see the sheep.
[101:32.14]Let's go.
[101:37.95]I mean, he's a huge sheep.
[101:39.37]You really can't miss him.
[101:40.13]There he is.
[101:45.37]Make him eat more people.
[101:47.34]No, I don't want him to eat people because I don't want that to be a thing that he just does on his own.
[101:53.06]He already has done it like twice.
[102:06.17]Don't feed him meat?
[102:08.93]He can eat meat, but just not people.
[102:15.39]I tried to give him a tree.
[102:16.37]Remember he kicked it over and he looked at me and he pointed at me and laughed?
[102:19.84]I tried to feed him a plant.
[102:26.74]Feed him grain.
[102:27.54]Alright, yeah, I...
[102:34.84]Alright.
[102:36.26]I see what you mean.
[102:37.28]That's alright.
[102:38.56]Let's learn another spell.
[102:43.52]Jerma doesn't know what cow is he?
[102:44.78]This is not even a real... This is a god cow.
[102:48.88]This is not even a cow.
[102:49.66]This is like a god thing.
[102:51.24]When I was Nemesis' creature, he often sent me into battle.
[102:59.20]I foresee the same for you.
[103:02.55]First, I will become your size to make things easier.
[103:05.73]Combat training.
[103:07.23]Be prepared to get bruised.
[103:09.89]Don't worry.
[103:10.89]In time, things will heal.
[103:15.54]I love the point, though.
[103:19.78]Alright, kick his ass.
[103:21.00]An arena will appear every time there is a fight.
[103:33.55]You should know that your creature will fight without help from you.
[103:37.42]He doesn't want to do it.
[103:38.12]He's scared.
[103:38.68]He's like, no, no, I just want to eat people and shit in bushes and kick walls.
[103:44.24]Alright, get him.
[103:50.62]Get him.
[103:50.94]Firstly, let's learn to attack.
[103:54.45]Click on a part of my body using the action button just right there.
[104:03.38]A good hit.
[104:04.62]You can queue up multiple attacks as well.
[104:08.56]Try queuing up several attacks on me now.
[104:12.46]That's right.
[104:13.50]Now you must learn to block attacks.
[104:16.73]Click the action button on your creature to make him block.
[104:19.85]Block?
[104:22.25]Yeah, you have to block.
[104:24.47]That's it.
[104:25.35]A good block there.
[104:27.67]You'll stop blocking if you do another command.
[104:31.63]Let us concentrate on dodging.
[104:34.71]Click the action button anywhere on the ground to move the creature there.
[104:40.45]That's it.
[104:41.15]You have learned well.
[104:43.53]Let us try some friendly combat to test these skills.
[104:46.67]Will struck.
[104:59.56]How do I un-cue a move?
[105:03.04]Okay, okay.
[105:05.82]Block.
[105:07.36]Block.
[105:07.56]He's actually pretty good.
[105:11.77]Block.
[105:12.25]Block.
[105:12.57]Block.
[105:28.97]Kick.
[105:35.16]Good dodge.
[105:36.44]Block.
[105:37.66]Block.
[105:40.52]Double kick.
[105:49.90]One more.
[105:50.74]Oh, fuck.
[105:51.28]You're going to lose to sheep wheel.
[105:55.23]No, you don't.
[105:56.43]What are you talking about?
[106:00.45]I don't think I can win.
[106:02.01]Yeah.
[106:02.87]See?
[106:06.01]That was an important lesson, friend.
[106:13.87]You show great potential, but work on your technique.
[106:17.27]Oh, it's because it's nighttime.
[106:23.07]Right.
[106:23.55]Where's he going?
[106:26.37]No farewell?
[106:37.62]Okay.
[106:38.00]Ooh, he just gave me power.
[106:44.09]I have a secret for you, but I warn you, this knowledge is dangerous.
[106:49.11]And you're watching the Disney Channel.
[106:53.21]But come only when you are ready.
[106:55.85]What I will tell you is forbidden knowledge, dangerous even to gods.
[107:00.49]It's going to be how to create tornadoes and meteors and shit.
[107:03.74]Why don't you try out what you've learned while I sleep?
[107:11.30]How you doing?
[107:12.20]Hungry?
[107:12.56]Tired?
[107:14.06]You're alright.
[107:18.22]Alright, let's go rest up a little.
[107:19.44]Hold on, there's another scroll over here.
[107:23.99]What is this?
[107:34.07]Oh, how horrid.
[107:35.23]I think he's trying to speak.
[107:38.24]Is it a bat?
[107:39.26]Let's go pick his ass.
[107:41.56]Just throw a rocket at him.
[107:43.40]Hmm.
[108:18.81]What?
[108:19.23]You're immune to rocks?
[108:32.83]Oh, I can't.
[108:33.71]I can't.
[108:34.33]Alright, where's my creature?
[108:38.47]Let's go.
[108:40.36]Let's get you some food, and then let's have you beat this guy up.
[108:45.30]In fact, let's just do it now.
[108:57.80]He doesn't believe in you.
[109:03.76]So?
[109:09.90]This is an evil playthrough?
[109:11.77]I don't think this is evil.
[109:12.57]Wait, why can't I... Creature, you can't go this way?
[109:16.07]Why am I getting an X?
[109:27.01]Look at how confident he is.
[109:27.93]He's not gonna kick the shit out of me, right?
[109:35.07]Oh.
[110:01.82]Oh, fuck.
[110:02.78]Come on, come on.
[110:03.60]Kick him.
[110:04.36]Kick him.
[110:05.28]Do a move.
[110:07.42]Alright, nice, nice, nice.
[110:09.46]Okay, I can do this.
[110:11.17]Block.
[110:15.61]Block.
[110:25.37]Again.
[110:25.99]Offense again.
[110:27.49]Block, block, block, block, block.
[110:35.41]Nice, come here.
[110:44.58]Shit.
[110:46.78]That fucking dodge.
[110:47.66]Get it again.
[110:57.94]Oh, I queued up a big one too.
[111:09.83]Don't lose.
[111:11.05]Come on.
[111:11.69]It's just my fucking... I'm going like off screen here.
[111:14.31]Stop!
[111:20.09]Do I die?
[111:20.73]Do you die?
[111:26.83]I can't even get close to him.
[111:30.03]I can't get fucking close to him.
[111:35.15]What the fuck was that?
[111:47.54]How do I run?
[111:48.04]How do I run?
[111:49.36]How do you run away?
[111:50.04]Hold on, leader.
[111:58.62]Pull back from the fight and try again when we've recovered some strength.
[112:05.72]Yeah, I'm destroyed.
[112:07.22]Oh, Jesus.
[112:10.28]Oh, no!
[112:18.80]He tried!
[112:19.38]He tried!
[112:20.60]Oh!
[112:27.38]He was trying to be... Oh, is he dead?
[112:31.00]He's not dead, right?
[112:31.76]Alright, you know, he's okay.
[112:37.93]I actually just got scared.
[112:39.11]Oh, he got the shit kicked at him.
[112:40.83]Alright, it's fine.
[112:50.64]He's just standing there like, no, I'm good, I'm good, don't worry, I'm fine.
[112:53.68]I'm fine, I'm fine.
[112:55.64]Just instantly does like the Mortal Kombat.
[112:57.62]You got kicked on the ground with zero health.
[113:01.63]Stood up and fell back down.
[113:08.87]Look at those eyes.
[113:09.61]This is not good.
[113:11.45]Alright, come here.
[113:14.45]Let me... No, Jesus Christ!
[113:16.86]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[113:18.28]Don't get up.
[113:18.66]Lay down.
[113:18.98]Stay down, stay down, stay down, stay down.
[113:21.45]Stay down.
[113:21.85]Stay down.
[113:22.21]Lie down.
[113:25.15]You did good.
[113:29.00]You tried.
[113:29.46]You really did.
[113:32.48]Just hang out over here for a minute.
[113:35.42]Let me get you some food.
[113:39.02]There's a silver reward scroll on the beach behind those huge gates.
[113:44.47]Okay, here.
[113:47.21]Have something to eat.
[113:49.50]You look like- you look skinny.
[113:50.62]Here.
[113:55.76]Alright.
[113:56.78]He doesn't like it.
[113:57.64]He has a taste for meat now.
[114:02.62]I actually do- I don't want you going fucking anywhere.
[114:07.04]Stay here.
[114:08.06]Stay here.
[114:08.96]How do I, like, attach you to- Alright, stay here.
[114:11.94]You need to heal.
[114:12.78]Rest up.
[114:15.60]Alright, beach.
[114:22.81]Where was that scroll?
[114:25.25]On the beach somewhere.
[114:28.88]No, there's this one.
[114:29.56]I remember that one.
[114:31.96]What beach was it on?
[114:34.80]There.
[114:37.11]Alright.
[114:38.89]Let's do this one.
[114:42.47]We've got this notion that we quite like to sell the ocean, so we're building a big boat to leave here for good.
[114:51.61]We're not keen on sinking, so we're all sitting here and thinking, cause we've built it too big and we've run out of wood.
[115:03.24]Oh, idly, idly, we simply can't leave till we get some more wood.
[115:11.22]Oh, we're not keen on sinking, so that's why we're sitting thinking, cause we simply can't leave till we get some more wood.
[115:20.33]You're looking for a prayer?
[115:21.37]You're looking for me to supply wood?
[115:22.83]How dare they leave after all we've done for them?
[115:27.04]What have we done for them exactly?
[115:29.42]Perhaps we should help them out.
[115:31.22]It might be nice.
[115:35.51]How much wood do they need?
[115:36.33]What does it say?
[115:41.47]The Ark.
[115:45.25]Oh, no, no, no.
[115:47.57]I don't want to do this again.
[115:49.49]I can't skip it again.
[115:50.97]I can't skip.
[115:51.93]Sinking.
[115:54.65]We're all sitting here thinking.
[115:58.89]We built it too big and we've run out of wood.
[116:04.76]I know I'd leave.
[116:05.74]I know I'd leave.
[116:08.20]We simply can't leave till we get some more wood.
[116:14.08]Oh, we're not here sinking.
[116:16.24]So that's what I said I'm thinking.
[116:18.50]Because we simply can't leave till we get some more wood.
[116:25.48]Oh, you're not going to leave me hanging.
[116:26.76]I'm going to do another verse.
[116:38.47]We need wood.
[116:39.99]How much wood?
[116:42.85]I wish it would tell me.
[116:44.75]Let's go get some... Let's do it.
[116:46.06]I'll do it.
[116:46.82]I could smash up their thing right now, but I know you're looking at me.
[116:49.54]I know.
[116:50.52]I'm just gonna take wood.
[116:51.94]Let's go.
[116:53.60]How much wood do I have over here?
[116:54.80]An absolute shitload.
[116:55.70]Like, too much.
[116:59.21]Let's get like 5,000.
[117:07.02]Alright.
[117:09.26]What are they doing over here?
[117:11.44]Are they praying?
[117:13.20]What the fuck was that?
[117:23.75]Hey!
[117:24.47]What?
[117:26.07]Did he kick that from all the way?
[117:29.09]What did you do?
[117:32.85]Why is the leash not working?
[117:34.57]Hey, you're supposed to be stuck in there.
[117:40.70]Why is the leash not working?
[117:42.62]What is going on?
[117:47.66]This... Get over here.
[117:50.62]Wait a minute.
[117:51.42]What the fuck is going on here?
[117:55.31]Get over here.
[117:55.99]You're in big trouble.
[117:59.09]You are actually in big trouble.
[118:00.65]Get over here.
[118:05.85]He did...
[118:10.71]I'm gonna make a FIFA reference here.
[118:14.39]Because that's the only way I can make this reference.
[118:18.45]He just grabbed the ball as the goalie, and did a full power kick across the whole game, and for some reason you fucked up as the other goalie, like you are on the other team, and they scored from the other side.
[118:31.29]That was ridiculous.
[118:37.84]Get over here.
[118:41.02]I need to, like, put in... Do you want to boulder or something?
[118:46.88]You can't kick that out, right?
[118:53.15]I played, like, FIFA maybe once.
[118:55.49]But that's what it reminded me of.
[119:03.14]Punish him.
[119:04.20]I...
[119:05.82]It's been too long.
[119:06.88]I can't punish him.
[119:07.54]It's been too long.
[119:08.02]Alright, I'm just gonna like, I'm gonna like just... Don't do that.
[119:14.49]Yeah, he can't get out.
[119:23.73]He's stuck.
[119:26.07]He just fucking like threw... Imagine if that was a rock.
[119:29.99]Imagine if he had access to a rock.
[119:33.11]That would have been catastrophic.
[119:37.10]Alright, where's this stupid boat?
[119:43.58]Look what I got.
[119:44.92]Wood.
[119:49.25]Look at that.
[119:50.91]Thank you for... Three guys, huh?
[120:08.29]Now destroy the ship?
[120:09.83]No.
[120:15.69]Oh, the boating is now finished, but there's still something on the wish list to keep us all going through the wind and the rain.
[120:25.68]There's no food on the table, these men still isn't able, and we ain't going nowhere till we get some grain.
[120:35.94]Why Lylee?
[120:37.58]Why Lylee?
[120:39.54]We simply can't leave until we get some grain.
[120:44.26]I couldn't read that part.
[120:45.68]There's no food on the table and we can't sell us rain.
[120:49.86]So we ain't going nowhere till we get some grain.
[121:02.80]I'm not doing that again, by the way.
[121:04.65]I refuse to sing another one of those.
[121:06.87]Like, lazy singing is what I was doing.
[121:11.37]Well, that kind of worked too.
[121:12.27]Alright, let's drain.
[121:13.17]Fine.
[121:13.63]Go.
[121:13.85]He's pissed.
[121:38.12]Well, don't just soccer kick balls into people that are praying.
[121:44.54]That's incredibly mean.
[121:52.56]Here, I'm putting this back.
[122:01.35]Oh, that's my ball!
[122:02.29]Yes, it is.
[122:04.17]Don't do that again.
[122:10.38]Dude, I'm not even certain the leash does a fucking goddamn thing.
[122:13.47]Like, how can he... Why can he do this?
[122:24.54]He's not gonna do it again.
[122:41.36]This leash doesn't do anything.
[122:50.33]This... How do I make the leash work?
[122:56.45]You're gonna lose it.
[122:58.35]You're gonna lose it in the water.
[123:02.76]Lock it with mouse too?
[123:04.64]I mean, isn't it locked?
[123:06.72]It's locked to a tree like a hundred fucking miles behind him.
[123:10.51]Fish farms can provide food for your village.
[123:12.21]A fisherman will deliver his catch to the village.
[123:13.93]Oh, that's cool.
[123:16.09]Shorten the length of the... How do I shorten the length?
[123:18.85]Alright.
[123:21.12]Stop.
[123:21.44]Get up here.
[123:33.10]Just let him do what he wants?
[123:34.08]No, it's a problem.
[123:36.58]Alright, so if I attach it to here, and then how do I shorten the leash?
[123:49.20]Alright, so I have the leash here, so how do I shorten it now?
[124:01.33]Okay.
[124:02.39]Leash, this one here.
[124:04.99]Restrict the area in which a creature can move when it's on a leash.
[124:07.21]First, attach the leash to an object, then click the action button anywhere on the leash to pick it up.
[124:12.21]Pull to stretch the leash to the length you want it to be, then click the action button on the ground to set its length.
[124:32.36]Like, let, uh... Is that gonna work?
[124:39.76]No, it's not working.
[124:43.88]I never understood this mechanic either.
[124:45.38]I mean, it's... I should be able just to stick it, right?
[124:51.40]Like that?
[124:52.54]Because, look, I'm just giving him slack.
[124:56.26]Pull.
[124:57.60]Pull.
[124:59.59]I...
[125:01.29]It's probably bugged.
[125:03.27]Well... Pull it back into the building.
[125:08.83]I don't know if that's doing anything.
[125:18.80]Is it the scroll wheel?
[125:19.76]I don't think so.
[125:20.82]Hold on, did that work?
[125:27.10]Maybe that did work.
[125:34.36]Um... Maybe.
[125:35.89]I'll check back later.
[125:36.71]I think it worked.
[125:37.17]Yeah, you have to, like, pull it into the... I think that worked.
[125:43.05]Is he bigger?
[125:44.07]Maybe a little.
[125:45.19]Alright, I need to do, uh, Honey Brain.
[125:46.73]Go get his ball.
[126:01.85]No, it didn't work.
[126:08.59]Why can he just do this forever?
[126:17.23]He wants the ball.
[126:18.25]Alright, whatever.
[126:19.29]I gotta put this wood back.
[126:31.53]He's hungry.
[126:33.19]Stop kicking the shit.
[126:38.25]Stop.
[126:43.38]Go back up here.
[126:49.98]Dude, your leash is too long.
[126:54.28]Fix the screen?
[126:55.33]What are you talking about?
[127:02.87]Just reapply the leash.
[127:04.81]Here.
[127:11.43]Leash is on.
[127:15.35]Leash is on.
[127:15.91]Maybe choose a tree?
[127:20.47]Nah, he ran all the way over.
[127:21.83]Whatever, he'll be fine.
[127:22.84]Use a regular leash?
[127:23.68]Isn't this a... This is a regular leash.
[127:26.36]This is like the... Your... This is the neutral one, right?
[127:32.08]Alright, let me go do the grains thing.
[127:36.13]How much do they need?
[127:36.69]I don't know.
[127:45.29]2,000?
[127:45.75]4,000?
[127:45.79]We'll just do like 4,000.
[127:47.03]A million grain.
[127:50.44]Well, that would be ridiculous.
[127:51.42]Alright, where the hell is that boat?
[127:57.34]I keep losing shit.
[128:00.08]It was over here, wasn't it?
[128:11.32]Alright, here.
[128:11.88]Another thing.
[128:15.80]Why don't you eat Bob over there?
[128:41.38]Thanks for all this meat.
[128:42.82]We need more meat though.
[129:18.37]Wait, how many people are gonna leave?
[129:33.68]See, what they don't know is I'm doing that thing where I grab an arrow and try to burn it down.
[129:40.08]It's like sending out a funeral.
[129:56.22]I just hate goodbyes.
[129:59.98]I just hate good.
[130:02.76]Oh, but I got something.
[130:03.96]What is it?
[130:06.00]This pedestal is a miracle dispenser.
[130:09.05]It charges up and generates one-shot miracles.
[130:13.17]Click on the signpost for more info.
[130:15.49]Is it rain?
[130:16.33]Clouds?
[130:16.75]What is it?
[130:19.61]A handful of water.
[130:21.74]There are miracles hidden all over Eden.
[130:24.06]Keep your eyes peeled.
[130:25.92]A miracle dispenser gives out one-shot miracle wonders when it's fully charged.
[130:29.61]This is water.
[130:37.65]Um... Okay.
[130:48.24]What's, uh... Water... Like... I don't know.
[130:53.36]This is... It's my village?
[130:54.38]No.
[130:55.16]Not yet.
[130:56.82]Oh, they have a stone over there.
[130:57.84]What's that thing?
[130:58.38]Alright, how about right over here?
[131:02.98]Let's water the trees.
[131:06.45]Like, over here.
[131:06.89]Alright.
[131:19.78]Nice.
[131:22.46]What do you mean, the cow?
[131:23.58]What?
[131:38.92]There's no point in even having this leash on.
[131:47.60]There's just no point.
[131:49.08]Here.
[131:50.31]You go do you.
[131:55.33]Has he eaten anything without you looking?
[131:56.83]I don't know.
[131:58.83]You have to restrict the length of the leash.
[132:05.46]Yeah, I tried to do that like five times.
[132:08.32]Just pull it and click the action button.
[132:10.92]It just... I can't get it to do anything.
[132:17.90]Yeah, it legit just didn't work.
[132:19.68]It really didn't.
[132:20.60]I kept undoing it.
[132:21.94]What are you talking about?
[132:23.14]Alright, I'm gonna do this one more time.
[132:26.86]So we can be clear.
[132:34.84]Oh my god, that's a lot.
[132:36.42]What did you... That's a lot of...
[132:38.87]Alright, leash is on tree.
[132:41.75]Right?
[132:42.23]Okay.
[132:42.63]Leash on tree.
[132:50.24]You hate this person!
[132:52.52]He comes over and points every time.
[132:53.88]Alright, so... No, wrong.
[132:56.59]Alright, so look.
[133:00.77]So, grab the leash.
[133:03.59]I have the leash in my hand right now.
[133:09.66]I can't do anything.
[133:15.39]I mean... You moved it.
[133:20.27]Don't do that.
[133:27.52]Don't click.
[133:28.00]Well, I have to... Okay, I have to hold right-click to hold this.
[133:38.96]Right click, I have to hold right click, right?
[133:42.32]If I let go of right click, he just let it go.
[133:48.09]Like, I can pull it, but it doesn't seem to do anything.
[133:53.39]I mean, scrolling just moves in and out.
[133:57.16]And if I click, he just lets it go.
[133:58.54]Like, it just... I don't know.
[134:05.82]He's just gonna roam around, whatever.
[134:10.47]Or he can just do that.
[134:12.13]And it doesn't even matter where the leash is.
[134:22.04]He's pissed.
[134:23.36]Did he just- What?
[134:25.28]Hold on, did he just do like the- Fuck you?
[134:37.79]Why do you hate this person?
[134:39.09]I don't understand what his problem is.
[134:44.52]Just go relax.
[134:45.76]Go sleep somewhere.
[134:46.66]I got stuff to do.
[134:49.00]Alright, he's coming back.
[134:54.84]Alright, alright, alright.
[134:57.92]The temple is like clicking right now.
[135:04.88]Why is the temple doing this?
[135:07.57]Oh, creature, creature room.
[135:12.39]The Creature Cave.
[135:15.15]The screws display different attributes about your creature.
[135:18.56]Oh, that's cool.
[135:22.54]Is that a raid coming?
[135:23.94]From Lime, Limealicious.
[135:27.88]Thank you, Limealicious, for the fucking raid.
[135:29.53]Welcome, everybody.
[135:30.77]What's going on?
[135:33.50]I'm playing Black and White, an old PC game.
[135:37.28]Thanks, Lionelicious.
[135:38.48]Appreciate the raid.
[135:41.72]Lions.
[135:42.22]Pog.
[135:42.64]Lions.
[135:43.22]Pog.
[135:50.58]Miracle.
[135:51.00]Your creature has learned how to cruise.
[135:52.57]Okay, not yet.
[136:00.05]Alright, so he doesn't know how to do anything.
[136:03.35]Creature mind.
[136:10.05]I am slightly greedy.
[136:11.59]I'm extremely tired.
[136:13.24]I'm very compassionate.
[136:14.94]I'm extremely frightened.
[136:16.52]I'm rather playful.
[136:18.54]I think my god is on the side of good.
[136:20.88]My deity has paid me quite a lot of attention.
[136:23.90]What do I think about the creature guide?
[136:25.08]He's on the side of good.
[136:28.00]When I think about creature Sleg, he is black-hearted.
[136:33.95]The creature god is the person that he ate, by the way.
[136:40.87]I know about one temple.
[136:41.81]I know about two creatures.
[136:43.48]Oh, Sleg.
[136:44.38]Okay, we have to kick Sleg's ass.
[136:47.99]More general information such as his age and height.
[136:51.37]Bless him.
[136:52.27]Wait, his name is God?
[136:53.47]Hey, boss.
[136:54.11]You can change or add tattoos to the creature by clicking on him.
[137:00.80]Alright, wait.
[137:01.78]How do I rename the character?
[137:03.40]Amount of poop, zero.
[137:07.68]People killed, one.
[137:10.12]Animals killed, eight.
[137:11.12]12 poops.
[137:14.16]So he's only killed one person, and it was the creature trainer.
[137:25.67]How do I rename it?
[137:34.00]Your creature has learned that he can take food from the field, okay?
[137:39.20]Your creature doesn't know how to use the totem.
[137:41.34]Get him to watch you moving it, alright?
[137:44.03]Doesn't know how to use the village store.
[137:45.43]Get him to watch the villagers use... Okay.
[137:47.89]It's on the list.
[137:49.37]Your creature has learned how to fish.
[137:50.58]Your creature has learned how to dance.
[137:54.30]I can see that.
[137:58.10]Alright, let's go.
[138:00.58]This creature's dumb.
[138:01.86]Yeah, pretty dumb.
[138:03.88]Pretty dumb.
[138:04.94]Let's check this.
[138:05.50]132 people living.
[138:06.34]96% believe.
[138:06.60]10 deaths.
[138:06.82]67 births.
[138:15.07]Okay, we need some more.
[138:16.41]Alright, I gotta make some more people.
[138:22.73]Alright, let's head out of here.
[138:26.44]Oh, there he is.
[138:30.64]What's with the heartbeat?
[138:31.56]Why is that happening?
[138:46.45]Didn't it say I can, like, do something to him?
[138:48.07]I can give him, like, tattoos?
[138:57.99]Give him some tattoos.
[138:58.76]I don't know.
[138:59.10]How do I do that?
[138:59.64]Alright, well, hold on.
[139:02.78]I got other tasks that I have to complete so I can get some more miracles and shit.
[139:06.18]Because, yeah, like, we gotta... What is this one?
[139:18.00]Who the fuck is this guy?
[139:19.06]What?
[139:19.16]Uh, let's go.
[139:46.16]Alright, I gotta get this heartbeat to turn off before I lose my mind.
[139:51.62]How do I shut this off?
[140:19.88]Is this something that it wants me to do in here?
[140:21.40]Is that a notification?
[140:28.61]The challenge cave or something?
[140:29.91]Like, hey, there's a challenge you have to do.
[140:31.35]I mean, I don't know.
[140:36.19]This doesn't look right.
[140:40.89]Ah, this doesn't look right at all.
[140:49.23]The Pied Piper.
[140:50.15]Alright, well, at least I... Uh, we got it.
[140:57.16]No more heartbeat.
[141:02.94]Alright, come with me.
[141:05.30]We have to find the person that's stealing the children.
[141:12.59]Where the hell is that?
[141:15.91]No, the heartbeat's back!
[141:35.93]I can hear it everywhere.
[141:36.93]Go save the kids?
[141:40.41]I'm trying to find where the... Wait.
[141:44.75]Hey, come eat these mushrooms.
[141:59.86]Try that.
[142:00.20]Was it good?
[142:03.66]It was good, huh?
[142:09.16]It was pretty good.
[142:10.22]It was alright.
[142:10.80]He loves them.
[142:11.54]Alright, let's go.
[142:20.79]What's wrong?
[142:25.11]He's like slowing down.
[142:31.21]Look, there's more over here.
[142:31.99]There's a sheep.
[142:36.97]Alright, you go take a look over here.
[142:39.13]I gotta return this sheep.
[142:43.20]For the love of God, that fucking heartbeat.
[142:45.90]How do I get it to stop?
[142:48.80]It won't stop!
[142:49.78]Where's the sheep guy?
[143:06.20]Many thanks, Higher Power.
[143:07.82]Keep them coming, please.
[143:11.21]It's under the floor.
[143:12.33]Alright, back at the cow.
[143:14.35]How you doing?
[143:22.40]Uh, I think he might- Alright, I'm gonna just look for this cave.
[143:34.88]Not cave.
[143:35.42]What I'm looking for is this, too.
[143:37.02]What is this?
[143:44.11]As I see it, there ain't no need for me to bow before you, son.
[143:48.67]I ain't seen deadly from you, which impresses me one itty bit.
[143:52.97]Gods have huge creatures.
[143:55.23]That's what my mama always told me.
[143:56.99]And until I see a big enough one, you don't mean nothing to me.
[144:04.21]Okay.
[144:04.59]I need to have a big creature.
[144:06.57]Don't leave him as a lost soul.
[144:08.95]Show him your creature.
[144:10.05]Oh, let him die alone.
[144:12.88]It's what he wants.
[144:14.04]The heck?
[144:14.96]You don't have to justify yourself to him.
[144:17.88]Oh, come on.
[144:19.13]You've got better things to destroy.
[144:54.97]Believe me now?
[145:04.93]Okay, fine
[145:20.96]You killed him, you uncaring, horrid, mean god.
[145:37.61]Wait.
[145:42.93]Wait, what?
[145:43.35]Is he dead?
[145:58.29]But why can I touch it?
[145:59.21]Why can I pick him up?
[146:06.73]Where was that?
[146:08.21]Where was that?
[146:08.89]Oh, I got so turned around.
[146:10.31]Fuck.
[146:10.61]Where was that?
[146:15.60]Where was that?
[146:16.12]Right here.
[146:49.56]I'm gonna take myself completely out of the picture.
[146:51.66]I want to see.
[146:52.22]I want him to learn.
[146:52.89]I want him to see things.
[146:53.87]I don't want to be like, what?
[146:55.47]Dead, you know what I mean?
[146:56.33]Person.
[146:57.37]I'm taking myself completely out of this one.
[147:01.27]House, you know.
[147:02.11]What else is over here?
[147:02.75]He needs to see things.
[147:15.44]He notices.
[147:15.80]He's like, what's that?
[147:19.93]Who's that?
[147:21.15]He's just looking at him.
[147:28.91]No, no, no.
[147:30.01]You didn't learn anything.
[147:34.93]Look.
[147:35.67]You need to learn.
[147:39.23]Look, you didn't learn.
[147:40.17]Learn, learn.

[148:33.58]He's tired, that's why.
[148:35.64]Alright, get rid of him.
[148:36.42]Get rid of him.
[148:36.80]Get rid of him.
[148:37.14]I just have to get rid of him.
[148:38.41]I have to get rid of him.
[148:39.21]I have to get rid of him.
[148:40.35]I'm not gonna rub his belly.
[148:42.47]No.
[148:45.65]He has no idea what's going on.
[149:11.89]He's like, oh, I don't know what you want me to do.
[149:39.99]Oh, okay.
[149:53.36]Uh, just go do whatever you want.

[151:53.92]Actor.
[152:00.68]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[152:01.42]I need to... Oh, he's coming back for more kids.

[152:12.90]Where is he?
[152:17.93]Where is he?
[152:36.01]There he is.
[152:42.00]Alright.
[152:46.51]I need to know where this is.
[152:47.55]The screen is cut at the bottom.
[152:54.94]It's like that on mine, too.
[152:57.02]It's the way that the game runs.
[152:59.02]Like, this is the patch.
[153:00.14]What?
[153:00.42]What?
[153:16.23]Found it.
[153:17.63]Found it!
[153:21.23]Found it!
[153:25.00]Tie him up, boss!
[153:26.30]He's getting on my nerves!
[153:28.10]He's right, and he won't get away when he's leashed to our creature.
[153:33.66]What?
[153:38.85]I have to leash him?
[153:45.01]Wait, okay, wait, wait, stay here, stay here, stay here.
[153:51.98]Alright, we have to sneak up on him.
[153:55.34]Come over here.
[153:56.28]Stay here.
[153:56.78]No, stop.
[153:57.24]He's gonna keep coming out.
[154:21.35]Get away from me.
[154:22.19]Prod me.
[154:22.83]I don't care.
[154:23.35]I won't believe in you.
[154:24.72]Attach him.
[154:25.40]What the fuck?
[154:26.78]The creature won't catch me.
[154:28.38]I'm too fast.
[154:30.70]Tie him up, boss.
[154:32.00]He's getting in my noise.
[154:32.90]You guys get off my fucking screen.
[154:34.76]And he won't get away when he's leashed to our creature.
[154:40.21]The guy is like four pixels wide.
[154:52.51]Zoom in.
[154:54.71]Prove me.
[154:55.35]I don't care.
[154:56.09]I won't believe in you.
[154:59.85]Get away from me, you big monster.
[155:08.00]Your creature won't touch me.
[155:09.36]I'm too fast.
[155:11.16]I just... Tie him up, boss.
[155:13.12]He's getting on my nerves.
[155:15.00]He's right.
[155:15.98]And he won't get away when he's leashed to our creature.
[155:21.64]Leash.
[155:22.16]That's what I'm doing!
[155:24.82]You double right-click to leash!
[155:27.48]That's what I just did!
[155:32.79]Get away from me, you big monster!
[155:34.89]Prove me!
[155:35.57]I don't care.
[155:36.29]I won't believe in you.
[155:37.01]I thought it says you can't... Okay, the leash bugs it because he can just run.
[155:40.77]He can just run.
[155:41.43]Tie him up, boss!
[155:43.31]He's getting on my nerves!
[155:45.11]He's right.
[155:46.10]And he won't get away when he's leashed to our creature.
[155:59.70]Stop going over there!
[156:08.56]That doesn't work.
[156:09.24]Okay.
[156:15.44]Now...
[156:31.66]Go get him.
[156:34.70]Go get him!
[156:35.58]Go get him!
[156:36.38]Go get him!
[156:37.02]I can't tell him to do anything.
[156:58.06]Are you actually gonna do it now?
[157:07.87]Bullshit.
[157:08.07]Alright, uh... Alright, get... Save the little ones, and then drop a rock on his head.
[157:44.59]Thanks for letting me go.
[157:46.09]I've released the children.
[157:47.05]From now on, I'll be a proper, normal villager.
[157:50.53]Spreading belief of you and trying to forget how bad I've been.
[157:53.26]Wait, are we led to believe that you stealing and kidnapping children is... Oh, don't.
[158:02.04]Oh, no.
[158:02.38]Don't worry.
[158:02.92]No, there's gotta be some fucking jail time here, you know what I mean?
[158:11.02]I love the throw.
[158:39.80]Why does he always just go to sleep?
[158:51.75]No, I don't... Just eat him.
[158:57.33]Get it over with.
[158:57.95]Eat him.
[159:13.19]Alright, he's gone.
[159:18.49]Yay!
[159:19.51]Okay.
[159:20.55]He's tired?
[159:21.26]What was that?
[159:25.88]What happened?
[159:27.32]What's going on?
[159:27.74]What's going on?
[159:28.32]Why is everybody running away screaming?
[159:29.66]Alright, the Heal spell.
[159:40.48]Maybe it'll turn off the heartbeat.
[159:44.82]No, it won't.
[159:51.38]Oh, they saw him eat a human.
[159:53.14]Oh, that's right.
[159:58.57]Okay, I think it's time to go fight.
[160:00.53]No, I'm gonna do... I'm gonna get the sheep shit out of the way.
[160:04.21]What do you mean I ate the wrong person?
[160:08.77]Alright, you just hang out here.
[160:09.97]Be good.
[160:10.53]I need to... Well, I gotta do the sheep thing.
[160:13.42]It's probably like six or seven sheep or something.
[160:15.40]Easy.
[160:26.56]I might have to, like, reload the game, though.
[160:28.42]Wait, what is this?
[160:29.74]What?
[160:37.42]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[160:38.70]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[160:40.08]You're just gonna throw this at me right now?
[160:41.74]That's... I don't want this one, because this one's annoying.
[160:58.29]Are they all horses?
[161:01.28]Alright.
[161:02.50]We're gonna do click maps on this one.
[161:06.90]Yeah.

[161:08.88]I don't have click maps.
[161:09.84]Alright, what's it gonna... I'm gonna do by numbers.
[161:12.24]One, two, three, four, or five.
[161:13.48]In the order that they were from left to right.

[161:47.50]Oh my god.
[161:49.80]Yeah, that's because I said don't pick the fucking horse.
[162:10.01]Yeah, that doesn't count.
[162:11.95]Does that count?
[162:22.78]Do another vote for the top two.
[162:37.28]Alright, fine.
[162:37.86]It's four and two.

[163:23.08]This horse sucks.
[163:24.60]I'm so glad it's not going to be the horse.
[163:26.92]He's influencing us.
[163:28.12]Yes, I'm influencing the votes.
[163:29.40]Yes.
[163:30.02]I said gorilla.
[163:32.52]I'm not listening to this all day.
[163:33.68]Alright, it's done.
[163:45.89]It's gorilla.
[163:46.95]Done.
[163:51.14]Thank you for voting.
[163:51.62]We're going to pick the gorilla.
[163:53.52]But not yet.
[163:54.44]Because I need to do more.
[163:57.16]Alright, first of all, I need sheep.
[164:00.82]And then I have to... Ooh, it's raining.
[164:02.23]Did I do this?
[164:06.67]Should I claim this?
[164:08.21]That I did this?
[164:17.11]Alright, I think I'm going to restart the game.
[164:20.15]Did it just save?
[164:21.25]Next time the game saves, I'm going to restart to try to get rid of the stupid heartbeat.
[164:26.87]Teach miracles to your creature.
[164:28.41]Okay, yeah.
[164:31.25]Heal miracle.
[164:34.00]Come here, I want to leash you up.
[164:36.54]Right?
[164:37.04]Come here.
[164:39.72]Where is he?
[164:41.34]Come here.
[164:41.56]Come here.
[164:48.96]Alright, come here.
[164:53.06]Come look at this.
[164:53.54]Okay, look.
[165:02.15]See this?
[165:03.93]How do I eat?
[165:21.06]Okay, here.
[165:21.54]Come here.
[165:22.64]I can't... I guess I can't do both.
[165:23.62]What are you doing?
[165:24.26]Oh, he's eating.
[165:27.08]Look at what I have.
[165:28.58]Hey!
[165:30.78]He didn't like that.
[165:34.50]Do you learn that?
[165:38.47]Because if he's leashed... So, for instance, I got a leash on him.
[165:41.73]I can't pick up a spell while he's leashed.
[165:46.21]Oh, there we go.
[165:46.69]You have to link the... Okay.
[165:49.54]Come here.

[166:01.11]Come here.
[166:02.91]Look what I got.
[166:04.57]You see this?
[166:06.39]Are you looking?
[166:08.89]He's like, hmm, I'm interested.
[166:09.95]Alright, look.
[166:10.67]Do you see that?
[166:13.61]Cool, huh?
[166:15.45]Interesting.
[166:18.23]You asshole.
[166:19.15]You're not supposed to eat him.
[166:21.13]You're eating...
[166:27.37]I don't know if he learned that.
[166:34.27]Alright, whatever.
[166:35.07]I guess I'm... Let him sleep, let him sleep, let him sleep.
[166:41.84]This fucking heartbeat.
[166:43.00]Alright, can I... I need to save.
[166:44.20]The game has to save.
[166:49.62]So I can restart the game.
[166:52.72]Here, just... I'll take a sheep from here and put it over here.
[166:56.73]Doesn't matter.
[167:00.03]How many does he need?
[167:07.57]Is that not common?
[167:18.08]Still looking for sheep.
[167:26.12]Is this still the tutorial world?
[167:28.92]I mean, from my understanding, you just do this for, like, a few hours, and then you go to, like, the next level, in quotes.
[167:35.80]Like, level two.
[167:38.45]So, I mean, it is tutorial zone, but it is, like, chapter one.
[167:43.11]So good.
[167:45.01]Alright, can I be done with this now?
[167:49.13]Or does he, did I, is this whole thing fucked up because he ate one?
[168:00.06]There are still sheep missing.
[168:08.10]Hey!
[168:12.61]Don't do that!
[168:17.49]Not nice.
[168:23.33]He's gonna go in here and eat his sheep, isn't he?
[168:27.01]I'm never gonna do this.
[168:27.77]This is never gonna end.
[168:32.91]Oh, I can't do it to people, so I can do it to sheep instead.
[168:39.22]I'm not doing anything bad.
[168:41.30]It's sheep.
[168:43.58]I just can't do it to humans.
[168:45.68]Oh, I understand.
[168:46.85]He's learning.
[168:49.09]See, that's a person.
[168:51.59]I can't do that to you.
[168:52.57]I can do it to sheep.

[170:22.24]No!
[170:24.46]No, you can go to the bathroom!
[170:26.72]You can go to the bathroom!
[170:28.22]You can go to the bathroom, just don't... I... I... No, no, no.
[170:31.29]How do I make it so he knows he can go to the bathroom?
[170:33.17]He's gonna hold it.
[170:34.43]You're fine.
[170:38.76]Alright, I have to... I gotta get this fucking heartbeat out of here.
[170:44.94]Okay.
[170:47.70]I'm... Quit.

[170:55.19]What do you mean, don't quit?
[171:07.23]No, it saves it.
[171:08.81]OK, now hopefully we go to the heartbeat.
[171:27.94]And?
[171:54.66]No!
[171:56.04]It's because my... Wait, my... What's... Villagers are starving?
[171:59.46]Look at... Look at all this food!
[172:01.00]What?
[172:05.99]It's the other village.
[172:10.23]The other village has its own heartbeat.
[172:11.69]Look.
[172:14.05]Wait.
[172:19.83]They're fine.
[172:20.35]Look.

[172:33.31]It's like, oh, there's a huge problem here.
[172:35.87]What's the problem?
[172:40.82]Disciple breeder.
[172:45.18]No, no, no.
[172:46.20]I'm trying to get you to breed.
[172:47.12]Disciple breeder.
[172:49.94]I'm trying to get you to breed.
[172:50.75]I'm trying to get you to breed.
[172:52.33]I'm not trying to... Disciple breeder.
[173:00.31]No, stop!
[173:00.99]Alright, now you work on woodcutting.
[173:04.85]Dude, this fucking heartbeat.
[173:14.34]I don't understand why it's here.
[173:15.64]Alright, somebody look it up.
[173:20.13]Why does my temple heartbeat sound keep happening?
[173:27.50]Can you collect the orb on the cow statue?
[173:29.80]I don't think so.
[173:35.99]S. Going to village.
[173:44.51]S. Nothing to do.
[173:45.29]Nothing to do.
[173:45.87]Is it because everyone's bored?
[173:57.14]What is it?
[173:58.30]31, 87, 87, 71.
[174:03.79]Make them work.
[174:06.35]Going to farm.
[174:08.47]Alright, chilling out.
[174:09.13]Let's get to work.
[174:10.61]Disciple Forester.
[174:16.01]Disciple Forester.
[174:22.72]Disciple Forester.
[174:27.92]Okay, now, what about a grain mover?
[174:31.57]Wait, we need some farm stuff.
[174:33.69]Here.
[174:34.83]Yeah, we need some more farmers.
[174:38.61]Oh, people chilling out.
[174:39.43]Go do something.
[174:40.95]Okay.
[174:46.92]Alright, you know what time it is.
[174:51.16]It's time for you to...
[174:58.77]It's time for you.
[174:59.47]We're gonna go to the big, uh, the big guy.
[175:01.20]Where's the big guy?
[175:01.88]Here we go.
[175:03.62]Please, use the leash to bring your creature to me.
[175:08.82]Please, use the leash to bring your creature to me.
[175:13.12]Use the leash to bring your creature.
[175:22.39]Let's go!
[175:26.11]Kill Sleg.
[175:32.27]Should I kill Slag first?
[175:34.73]Let me... Okay, hold on.
[175:35.63]Let me walk the creature around in here first.
[175:38.37]Because they're... I gotta... They don't believe in me yet that much.
[175:42.69]And then I'm killing that orc.
[175:52.80]What route are you taking?
[175:58.77]To start eating people?
[176:00.07]No.
[176:01.53]No.
[176:06.05]Get the cow to carry rocks to increase strength?
[176:09.25]Does that work?
[176:22.18]Yeah, actually.
[176:23.16]Alright, well.
[176:24.66]Let me do this first.
[176:25.32]Oh, well, never mind.
[176:30.83]We're doing this instead.
[176:33.57]Come, little one.
[176:34.79]The most important lesson of all awaits.
[176:38.68]It's the key to this world.
[176:41.06]The heartbeat.
[176:41.94]It's the very secret of godliness.
[176:45.60]Please silence it.
[176:46.72]And it's the way you'll triumph.
[176:50.17]Follow me to the mountain.
[176:51.99]I will tell you everything there.
[176:53.57]Mm-mm.
[176:56.61]Mm-mm.
[177:03.53]Let's go!
[177:12.69]Silence of the heartbeat.
[177:15.80]I hope.
[177:18.64]Alright, what is it?
[177:31.79]I must tell you the secret of the Creed.
[177:34.08]It's the source of godly power.
[177:41.60]Creature, speak no more.
[177:44.68]Nemesis, my old master has returned.
[177:51.76]Quickly, come close my friend and listen well.
[177:54.70]This guy doesn't sound like somebody I want to listen to.
[178:05.47]What is it?
[178:10.53]Silence, traitor.
[178:12.19]You must not pass on the secret of the creeds.
[178:14.32]This is gonna be bad.
[178:16.74]Nemesis is so determined to be the only god.
[178:20.72]He wants to destroy all other gods and their creatures.
[178:25.39]He wants ultimate power.
[178:29.63]Silence!
[178:30.55]You will die for this.
[178:32.06]No!
[178:32.66]Find the three parts of the creed which are aligned.
[178:35.70]This is the only defense against Nemesis.
[178:39.84]Now run!
[178:40.78]Get away from here!
[178:41.92]Leave.
[178:44.05]You can't help me.
[178:45.45]Seek an ally to help you find the creeds.
[178:48.03]Seek an ally?
[178:50.17]Now run!

[178:57.47]Okay.
[178:58.60]Oh no!
[179:10.99]I got struck too though!
[179:14.13]No!
[179:29.98]I'm... I'm, like, cucked.
[179:34.01]How much da- Oh, I'm at 98% damage.
[179:40.93]I can't leave.
[179:41.55]Your creature's feeling curious!
[179:43.61]Alright, run.
[179:51.62]Okay, I don't like this.
[179:53.36]Your village is being trashed by Nemesis Storm.
[179:56.66]Hey!
[179:57.14]The entire place is getting wrecked.
[179:59.34]Yes, we must see if there's anything we can do for them.
[180:02.90]It does look like they need help.
[180:05.45]Water.
[180:06.57]The water spell.
[180:07.19]Death.
[180:11.27]Death.
[180:11.39]Alright, you just... Alright.
[180:18.74]Death.
[180:19.24]Death.
[180:20.68]Where's that water spell?
[180:21.44]Where is it?
[180:21.72]Is it on the beach somewhere?
[180:22.54]Where is it?
[180:34.14]Yeah, get the fuck out of here.
[180:37.66]Dickhead.
[180:38.95]Oh.
[180:46.33]Where's the- Where's my cow?
[180:48.93]Where's the cow?
[180:50.93]Cow?
[180:53.10]Let's go, get over here.
[180:58.98]What can I do?
[181:05.87]Heal.
[181:10.15]Okay, I healed.
[181:13.17]Um... Oh my god, this is horrible.
[181:15.37]I don't have any more spells.
[181:16.57]It's not to recharge, is it?
[181:22.18]Pick it up.
[181:23.44]Oh my god.
[181:31.08]This is hopeless.
[181:32.51]Wait, what's this golden light?
[181:38.22]This guy's trashing the place.
[181:40.26]Throw something into it.
[181:41.40]Oh, shit.
[181:42.04]Where's the cow?
[182:14.26]Where is he?
[182:18.02]What is this camera?
[182:19.26]Camera, please.
[182:22.98]Let's go.
[182:23.82]Follow me.
[182:31.60]God, there's a whole new world through there.
[182:37.64]That's it.
[182:38.38]I'm going through for a look.
[182:39.95]Tutorial over.
[182:40.65]He's braver than I thought.
[182:41.77]He's gone through.
[182:46.03]The villager was right.
[182:47.27]There's a new land through there, and we should send plenty of food, wood, and followers into the vortex as well.
[182:54.46]You really aren't afraid of this thing, are you?
[182:57.54]I say we throw things through and then go through it ourselves.
[183:01.45]Our creature will follow.
[183:03.31]Try clicking the action button on the scroll.
[183:05.97]What the hell?
[183:07.03]Do we want to live forever?
[183:08.95]Well, actually...
[183:12.14]Okay, hold on.
[183:13.34]Wait, wait, wait.
[183:14.54]I gotta start throwing shit in.
[183:15.74]Alright, I gotta start throwing people in?
[183:17.88]Wait, hold on.
[183:18.86]Grain and shit.
[183:27.96]Alright, hold on.
[183:29.95]Take everything.
[183:32.59]I have this 24,000 grain here.
[183:38.19]How do I make this go faster?
[183:51.05]Alright, you good?
[183:58.65]Get his toy ball.
[184:00.23]Oh fuck, where's his ball?
[184:26.46]Got it.
[184:26.74]Okay.
[184:27.24]Wood.
[184:28.08]Is he alive?
[184:33.16]Oh, no.
[184:35.90]Oh, no.
[184:36.16]You need to eat.
[184:36.62]You need to eat.
[184:37.02]You need to eat.
[184:38.78]Um... If he doesn't eat, he'll die.
[185:00.68]Alright, villagers.
[185:01.78]How do I get villagers to get in there?
[185:03.50]I have to just start throwing them?
[185:09.71]Oh, fuck.
[185:10.27]Alright, let's go.
[185:10.77]Uh...
[185:31.56]I'll take a few trees.
[185:32.74]Okay, um... Where's the cow?
[185:54.25]What is that?
[185:56.31]Oh, he's... Oh, pig!
[185:57.50]We need livestock.
[185:58.22]We need livestock.
[185:58.90]You're right.
[185:59.42]Good call.
[186:13.83]What else do I need?
[186:15.53]The ball.
[186:16.57]His ball, his ball.
[186:17.32]Where's his ball?
[186:21.42]He booted it somewhere.
[186:22.34]I have no idea where.
[186:23.48]I have no fucking clue where that ball is.
[186:31.13]I don't know.
[186:32.61]Get the gorilla.
[186:37.17]But... Wait, can I take both?
[186:43.94]I can't wait.
[186:44.64]I can't take both.
[186:46.84]Keeping the cow.
[186:53.15]Here, pick this up.
[187:02.23]Quick, throw it in.
[187:04.09]Throw it in.
[187:04.65]Do it.
[187:07.15]Look, see?
[187:08.03]We need some rocks.
[187:11.07]Wood pile.
[187:11.69]Oh, fuck.
[187:22.52]What about the vote?
[187:23.88]Well, I didn't know that you couldn't have more than one.
[187:27.94]I was under the assumption that I was going to have two friends, not replace the cow.
[187:30.94]Where's his ball?
[187:42.55]Is he going to go find his ball?
[187:48.38]He'll find it, right?
[187:50.32]What about take the spells?
[187:53.36]I don't know.
[187:53.76]I have no idea where he's going.
[187:54.72]But take the spells too.
[187:56.50]Does that work?
[188:02.33]I don't think it does anything.
[188:12.85]Take it.
[188:17.79]It actually went in.
[188:18.49]Yeah, it did.
[188:20.46]I'm just going.
[188:21.28]Fuck it.
[188:21.56]I don't care.
[188:22.28]I don't care.
[188:22.67]I don't care.
[188:23.23]We'll just take this one more person.
[188:27.73]And then, where's the cow?
[188:29.31]I need the ball, though.
[188:30.07]Where's his ball?
[188:36.98]Fuck.
[188:37.72]His ball.
[188:39.32]It's so important.
[188:40.20]What about the other spells?
[188:42.04]You mean the one on the beach?
[188:48.70]Anything else I missed?
[188:49.46]I'm looking for the ball.
[188:51.22]Anybody see a ball?
[188:55.66]Oh, wait.
[188:56.10]I can do this.
[188:58.28]No, I can't.
[188:58.74]It's too late.
[188:59.56]I'm out.
[189:00.24]I'm out.
[189:00.62]It's too late.
[189:02.65]What is... Oh.
[189:02.91]It's too late.
[189:05.37]It's too late.

[189:06.25]Ball top left?
[189:06.83]Are you serious?
[189:09.97]Fuck the spells and fuck the ball.
[189:15.53]Yeah, fuck it.
[189:16.03]We gotta go.
[189:17.03]It's time to go.

[189:21.33]It's over.
[189:23.18]It's over.
[189:23.56]It's over.
[189:23.84]I gotta go.
[189:27.08]It's over.
[189:27.40]I don't care.
[189:27.90]It's over.
[189:28.28]Whatever.
[189:28.84]I'll... Where is he?
[189:36.28]Any more people I can throw in there?
[189:39.08]No.
[189:39.40]Everyone's dead.
[189:45.19]I don't know where the ball is.
[189:47.55]I see the ball.
[189:48.29]No, you don't.
[189:49.94]He kicked it down here a long time ago.
[189:54.92]Like down this way.
[189:58.36]What about the Aztec village?
[190:07.89]These people are fine.
[190:24.78]Look at all this wood.
[190:25.80]For free.
[190:30.94]He kicked it around the shore.
[190:32.28]Around the portal.
[190:33.80]Well, we'll get one more good look at it.
[190:43.57]They worked hard for that?
[190:44.57]Yeah, they worked hard for that for me.
[190:47.35]That's how this works.
[191:00.10]What do you mean, ego?
[191:01.76]I am an all-powerful god that can do anything.
[191:09.24]I required 20,000 wood, and I got it.
[191:12.32]Alright, it's time to go.
[191:15.68]Let's go.

[193:00.59]This could be a lie.
[193:01.67]But you and I together can turn the tide of this war.
[193:05.73]There is much to do, though.

[204:14.04]Come on.
[204:21.81]Get over here.
[204:25.51]Where's the gorilla?
[204:27.33]Well, a gorilla... Can I not use these?
[204:35.58]What does it say?
[204:38.11]Do you know that you can hold the mouse button to pick up more food from a field?
[204:41.19]Yeah, I know.
[204:44.99]You need more buildings.
[204:47.46]Right.
[204:50.48]Stop, stop, stop.

[204:55.10]Is this a house?
[204:57.72]So how do I get you to build a building?
[204:59.50]How do I get you to do this?
[205:00.33]Should I water over here?
[205:09.79]Alright, well let's build some houses then!
[205:19.00]Oh fuck.
[205:24.12]I have given you an expert builder of worship sites.
[205:27.96]This building is of great importance.
[205:30.78]I shall return once you have finished building the worship site.
[205:35.65]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[205:36.89]Are we gonna cause some havoc now?
[205:39.11]Havoc?
[205:39.91]No, but it would be good to cast lots of lovely miracles when we need them.
[205:46.29]What about houses?
[205:49.56]You need to build the worship site.
[205:51.98]Create some disciples.
[205:53.46]Alright, hold on.
[205:54.16]Lots of fucking food here.
[205:55.10]Lots of fucking food here.
[206:19.87]I can't do everything for you.
[206:21.45]Look, look at how much food they have now.
[206:24.99]If buildings are not lived in, they will deteriorate over time.
[206:27.95]Who lives here?
[206:30.13]People live here, right?
[206:31.65]Yeah, look.
[206:32.37]You live here.

[206:46.13]Alright, I got numb.
[206:46.83]The builders are up here.
[206:47.91]I need some more wood though.
[206:49.71]Do I have any more piles of wood?
[206:50.63]There's one here.
[206:51.09]Okay, that one's done.
[207:01.32]Now we just have to build it.
[207:04.16]Where's my buddy?
[207:04.86]Wait, what's this?
[207:07.12]You can water your fields to improve the speed of crops grow.
[207:09.30]The water miracle will water your land superbly.
[207:12.20]Yes, it will.
[207:15.76]Although I want him to watch this.
[207:21.18]Look, see?
[207:23.23]Interesting, huh?
[207:26.51]The creature's learning how to use the store.
[207:28.73]Oh, because he's watching them move around?
[207:30.95]The creature's getting curious.
[207:38.51]Cool, huh?
[207:47.05]76%.
[207:47.11]He's almost there.
[207:54.26]Learn this.
[207:55.42]He's hungry.
[208:00.02]Okay, I need to... You need to eat something.

[208:05.45]Didn't I have livestock?
[208:08.79]Oh, here we go.
[208:09.59]The power you wield grows.

[208:27.14]Must build homes.
[208:30.60]Oops.
[208:31.14]No, no, no, no, no.
[208:31.78]Reward, reward.
[208:33.46]It's very, very finicky.
[208:39.60]Alright, so he's good.
[208:41.66]Uh... The creature will pay more attention to you from now on.
[208:45.55]Good.
[208:46.19]That means maybe he'll learn a damn thing.
[208:49.09]Uh, wood miracle.
[208:49.97]I'm gonna use it.
[208:50.55]The creature messed up that miracle.
[208:53.57]He's still inexperienced.
[208:57.15]What?
[209:02.60]The miracle of going to the bathroom?
[209:04.52]Oh!
[209:11.15]I don't understand.
[209:14.69]What did he mess up?
[209:16.07]I didn't even see it.
[209:16.61]Alright, let's put... I need some workers over here.
[209:32.40]Oh, he tried to cast water.
[209:34.04]Okay.
[209:35.68]It's alright.
[209:36.48]It takes a while.
[209:37.40]You can't just know magic immediately.
[209:40.63]Alright, we need some workers over here.
[209:43.21]You did it!
[209:56.32]You did it!
[210:03.63]You actually casted water.
[210:05.13]You know how to do it.
[210:07.71]Very good job.
[210:08.75]Like, absolutely phenomenal.
[210:12.79]Good work.
[210:15.15]The creature will be more inquisitive.
[210:18.61]He's doing it again.
[210:20.87]Slapping or stroking the creature determines whether he can and can't do something.
[210:24.41]Yeah, that's good.
[210:25.21]Keep at it.
[210:26.77]He just knows water now.
[210:28.18]He's so smart.
[210:31.48]You are the smartest creature ever.
[210:34.08]Your creature wants to be kind and generous.
[210:35.86]Do you guys want me to get rid of him?
[210:39.47]Alright, let's go over here Your creature will be kind and generous as he does the fuck you symbol and points and laughs at somebody good You must build homes
[211:07.75]He thought about it.
[211:08.85]He thought about it.
[211:09.59]He's thinking about what he wants to do.
[211:11.11]I want to be kind and generous.
[211:13.53]I'm going to figure out what to put you down.
[211:14.85]He's dead.
[211:15.57]I'm sorry I'm doing that voice a lot, but that's all I can think of.
[211:18.78]It's like that's what I hear.
[211:24.94]He's prepping them.
[211:26.80]Alright, well, get some sleep.
[211:36.98]He's tired?
[211:37.50]Alright, well, hey, go to bed.
[211:41.96]Go, go in your bed.
[211:46.04]Is this done?
[211:48.69]Oh, shit, this is done.
[211:49.43]Alright, what do I do about this?
[211:54.77]Your worship site is built.
[211:56.75]Now let me teach you how to create miracles.
[212:00.17]Your people will worship you at the temple.
[212:03.01]To send them there, you must raise the totem at the village center.
[212:07.17]You move the hand over the totem.
[212:11.33]Then you hold down the action button to grab the totem.
[212:16.11]You move the hand up and down to raise and lower the totem.
[212:21.74]I've raised the totem so your followers will go to the worship site.
[212:27.94]The higher you raise the totem, the more people from your village will go to worship you.
[212:33.41]This is emergency prayer.
[212:34.77]Now come look at your followers.
[212:45.44]Okay.
[212:45.86]They are dancing, worshipping you.
[212:48.46]This gives you power.
[212:51.49]alright it's a rave so what every single person in town comes here alright then look this is going to be a we're just going to make a bunch of people these are the miracles that your people offer you the miracles of grain wood and water and water to activate one grab the miracle with the action button and it will be charged by your worshippers
[213:20.59]You'll see the energy rings flowing into your hand.
[213:25.96]When the miracle is charged, it appears in your hand and you are ready to cast the miracle.
[213:32.52]Remember, worshipping comes at a cost.
[213:35.34]The needs of your worshippers can be seen on these flags.
[213:39.22]So it's good to satisfy these needs and keep your villagers in good health.
[213:49.81]I'll leave you now to experiment with miracles and expand your influence by growing your village.
[213:55.83]So you just have to have grain to stick it outside here?
[214:03.98]That's a lot of... They just took it all.
[214:08.74]Food desire, 100%.
[214:12.08]Each tribe has its own worship site constructed by village of the race.
[214:16.34]Each village has miracles at its village center, which also can be its worship site.
[214:22.02]Worshippers need food and rest, which can be seen on the needs flag.
[214:26.54]Worshippers will swap with less tired worshippers from the village if they're available.
[214:31.85]You must use the action button to activate a miracle for charging.
[214:36.23]Yeah, okay.
[214:36.83]Did he just shrink?
[214:42.43]He just shrunk.
[214:44.71]Worshippers can die chanting.
[214:48.71]In the middle of a worship site is a chant store.
[214:51.01]If no miracles are charging, the worshippers will chant into the chant store for later use.
[214:56.81]One-shot miracles may be added to the chant store.
[214:58.91]You can also give your charged miracle energy to other gods.
[215:05.29]Alright, I don't want them to dance to death.
[215:09.89]If you make your worship site look more interesting, then you'll get more power.
[215:12.79]Trees, rocks, and placing mushrooms.
[215:14.57]Okay.
[215:14.83]I'm going to put the heal miracle in here.
[215:20.71]Am I doing it right?
[215:22.53]Alright.
[215:29.08]Alright, alright, alright.
[215:31.34]Hold on.
[215:33.30]Oops.
[215:34.30]I'm going to heal you.
[215:37.96]The creature wants to be kind and generous.
[215:44.17]Is he bringing flowers to somebody?
[215:47.23]What's going on?
[215:49.29]Somebody's dead!
[215:50.15]Wait!
[215:54.93]Where's he going with this?
[215:55.58]He wants to be generous?
[215:57.36]Oh, he's planting.
[215:58.24]Oh, good job.
[216:06.12]I think he's making a garden.
[216:07.24]I don't know what he's doing.
[216:15.25]He's planting trees.
[216:20.81]Good job.
[216:30.22]It took four hours to make the... Your creature will be more kind and generous.
[216:35.10]Look, he's gonna do... I would say, I don't think you should put them over here.
[216:39.76]You're kind of gonna make a... It's gonna be annoying trees everywhere.
[216:43.36]Alright, whatever.
[216:43.78]Let him do his thing.
[216:45.56]We got wood.
[216:46.44]Here comes the house.
[216:47.06]Alright, I don't want you to... Alright, how do I stop this?
[216:52.44]Alright, I'm gonna put the totem down because they're gonna die.
[216:59.14]Everybody relax, go back to work.
[217:06.70]Okay, we got another scroll?
[217:13.48]The Cow God of Trees.
[217:14.42]I think we're gonna get violence.
[217:31.79]Here you can learn to attack that one Activate the scroll of your choice.
[217:42.36]Yeah, it's time.
[217:43.50]It's time to learn about learn about violence We shall use these as our targets Here are some fireballs to use
[217:56.90]You hold the action button down like this.
[218:01.06]You then move the hand to put momentum on the fireball.
[218:05.74]You release the action button to cast the fireball.
[218:09.90]Devastating.
[218:10.82]You missed.
[218:11.46]Fire spreads and causes serious damage.
[218:15.89]You missed.
[218:16.33]You can't do it.
[218:23.11]That's not what I did.
[218:33.14]Ugh.
[218:35.98]Well, OK.
[218:36.70]I hope that I don't.
[218:40.51]Do I get more?
[218:41.73]Oh, man.
[218:42.41]None of the hunts got posted.
[218:44.59]Have some more practice.
[218:46.45]Here are more fireballs.
[218:53.89]This is fucking hard.
[218:55.03]Can I get closer?
[218:59.76]Oh yeah!
[219:00.54]You hit one of the huts!
[219:02.32]Fire spread, you see.
[219:04.26]A village can be torched in minutes.
[219:07.28]My fireball challenge is complete.
[219:10.28]I have given the knowledge of the fireball miracle to your village.
[219:14.14]Oh, nice.
[219:14.61]I actually get it.
[219:14.97]From now on, your people can worship for this miracle at your worship site.
[219:21.05]Wow!
[219:21.63]We can create these now!
[219:23.75]What about this town over here?
[219:26.37]What do they do?
[219:28.52]What was that for?
[219:29.48]What did they do?
[219:40.48]They were heathens.
[219:41.26]Alright, let's, uh... I don't think I'm doing this thing right.
[219:46.49]Oops.
[219:50.19]Well, now I don't know ever.
[219:51.53]Wait, maybe I can... Where is he?
[219:53.33]Come here.
[220:01.91]21 he just said he's starting to learn that upset him and it gave him gas okay you can tap on a you can tap on a miracle seed to break it this place is in your hand yeah
[220:26.83]To burst the bubble of a one-shot miracle, will your creature attach the leash to the miracle itself?
[220:30.61]Really?
[220:30.93]Alright, well, come here.
[220:32.81]Let's try that.
[220:33.59]There's more stuff to do over here.
[220:37.10]By combining up to seven scaffolds, you can create the following structures.
[220:42.88]One is a small house.
[220:45.00]Two is a big house.
[220:45.92]Three is a civic building.
[220:48.49]Four is a field.
[220:49.41]Five is a village center.
[220:52.33]Soccer?
[220:52.97]Six scaffolds is a soccer field?! !
[220:57.58]How do I make a scaffold?
[220:59.34]I'm sure it's about to tell me.
[221:02.02]But wait, you come here.
[221:05.50]Come here.
[221:07.85]I want you to do this.
[221:15.59]I want him to open up this thing.
[221:19.95]Alright, see?
[221:21.48]He knows it's on there now.
[221:22.58]30%.
[221:24.04]Alright, he's learning it.
[221:27.35]Maybe he can figure it out.
[221:30.59]Here's the food miracle.
[221:34.29]Look.
[221:34.91]Watch what I can do.
[221:35.37]Isn't that cool?

[221:41.69]Well, don't stand in it.
[221:42.35]You can eat it.
[221:46.21]Look.

[221:50.09]Fuck it.
[221:53.95]Okay.
[221:54.21]Let's, uh... Let's figure this out.
[222:00.29]Khazar sent me.
[222:01.73]I can help you build your settlement up.
[222:08.51]Right.
[222:09.51]People are sleeping outdoors as they don't have enough buildings to live in.
[222:16.94]This is the workshop.
[222:18.18]I make scaffolding here.
[222:19.68]It allows you to decide when new buildings should be constructed.
[222:22.70]Alright, let's go.
[222:23.32]If you can supply me with enough wood, I can build a scaffold so that you can plan more houses.
[222:29.49]feed oh he's not no I need this person so you get scaffolds you can do I get it how much wood do you need uh the man in the workshop wants some wood okay I can do that how much like five grand ten grand well I'll give you ten thousand no let's do five thousand
[222:56.38]Don't make the soccer field, it's bugged.
[222:58.80]I think there's an actual patch to do that.
[223:00.89]Right here.
[223:01.23]Look, there's a lot of... Alright.
[223:09.64]How did I get this game?
[223:12.34]I bought it.
[223:13.90]And then I installed it.
[223:17.44]And then I had to do a bunch of tweaks to get it to work on Windows 10.
[223:20.44]Because if you don't know, this game had some of the shittiest DRM ever made.
[223:26.62]To a point where Windows actually removed the ability to use the DRM.
[223:34.51]Because it's such a vulnerable piece of shit.
[223:39.49]you have to like essentially you have to either disable a feature in windows and put your computer at risk or you have to go around the drm is the only possible way you can play it looks like your scaffolding is ready we just need to move it to an area where we want it that's a lot of wood to place a scaffold down on the ground alright let's get it scaffold value one
[224:08.22]when you're happy with its location and angle click the action button alright let's make like let's let's not be stupid about this how about um down here yeah sorry right here oh this is such a worthwhile cause planning homes to be built for the homeless there is another way to solve this homeless problem oh yes yeah kill him these two guys are wild

[247:13.08]We can't hear you?
[247:13.68]I know, I'm eating.
[247:15.26]I'm trying to eat silently because people hate that.
[247:21.91]These houses suck, by the way.
[247:26.47]Alright, do I have enough?
[247:28.42]I'm gonna add it up!
[247:30.35]Forest miracle?
[247:30.95]Planting trees?
[248:06.94]Constant worship is needed to maintain it.
[248:09.48]But the wood it provides is a blessing to the people.
[248:13.01]Didn't I already have this?
[248:19.07]What is it?

[248:45.67]I think I might have.
[248:48.87]Is this silica gel?
[248:49.67]No, it's not.
[248:50.91]I hate these bugs.
[248:51.73]Get these things out of here.
[248:56.86]God damn it.
[248:59.30]It was really sandy.
[249:04.24]Okay, so who do I have to destroy?

[249:41.94]Can I steal a lightning spell?
[249:44.48]Sure, I can.
[249:46.76]What is this?
[249:47.70]Uh... Oh, I'm not in one of these again.
[250:03.35]The stones hold the spirits of the ancients.
[250:06.49]Each has its own voice.
[250:10.78]It is said that when a correct tune is played, special powers are unleashed.
[250:15.94]When the stones are tapped, the spirit sings.
[250:20.16]Few people know the melodies.
[250:22.54]You may meet them or discover the melodies for yourself.
[250:27.70]Okay.
[250:29.89]Lightning?
[250:36.41]I just fucking learned a melody, goddammit.
[251:01.40]Expand your villages, ally.
[251:03.62]He's like, hey, I don't really mean to be in your face here, but you need to fucking work on your village.
[251:14.03]Quit ticking around.
[251:15.65]I am Lethis.
[251:16.99]Leave my territory.
[251:19.97]Fine.
[251:22.34]I'll just launch a fucking fireball.
[251:24.32]I'll just launch a fucking fireball at you from over here.
[251:27.84]Can I reach from here?
[251:38.26]Oh, Ricky.
[251:38.84]I'm just gonna launch a fucking fireball at you, Ricky.
[251:44.36]Should I do some- No, no, no.
[251:45.55]Not yet, not yet.
[251:46.19]We have to expand.
[251:47.77]Forest miracle.
[251:48.73]Let's do some prayer.
[251:51.01]Let's- Wait.
[251:51.71]I need grain.
[251:52.45]You said put it in the thing?
[251:55.89]The bottom is cut off because it's 1080p.
[251:59.04]This game was never designed to be 1080p in HD.
[252:02.82]So you lose like a tiny amount of the bottom of the screen.
[252:07.34]Sorry about that.
[252:14.37]Uh, let's get some forest.
[252:18.64]Come worship me.
[252:21.87]A hundred percent of the, oops.

[252:25.41]There we go.
[252:27.97]Let's go.
[252:29.15]I want the forest.
[252:32.10]Give it to me.
[252:32.60]This is the most beautiful game ever made.
[252:40.50]Huh?
[252:41.56]I don't know.
[252:53.68]What should I plant the trees over here?
[253:02.67]What is he doing?
[253:06.34]Go to bed!
[253:29.88]Give it to me.
[253:32.58]More.

[254:11.60]Do it again.
[254:24.13]Miracle forest.

[254:38.95]Uh-oh.

[254:58.84]Alright, I'll do one more.
[255:12.78]It should be close enough.
[255:26.21]This is Crave jerky.
[255:28.47]It's the best jerky you can buy.
[255:31.21]Full stop.
[255:39.85]Okay.
[255:45.39]Whoa, whoa, whoa.

[256:20.41]Alright, give me another one.
[256:21.69]Give me another one.
[256:22.21]Give me another one.
[256:23.17]Don't run.
[256:24.85]Give me one more.

[256:32.56]Okay, now everyone leave.
[256:34.42]Leave, leave, leave, leave, leave.

[256:40.40]Don't tell me I'm going to actually throw this.
[256:42.63]Am I?
[256:43.73]Can I pull this down?
[256:49.67]Alright, come on.
[257:06.53]Imagine seeing that.

[257:36.89]Are they burning?
[257:39.79]No, they aren't, right?
[257:44.61]Oh, there's another thing to do over here.
[257:50.09]Soon you will need to protect your villages and their buildings.
[257:54.46]The physical shield protects against objects which are not of a spiritual nature.
[258:00.38]When you have the miracle, this is how you cast a shield.
[258:06.90]You move the hand to where you wish to start the shield.
[258:11.43]What?
[258:11.69]Then you hold down the action button and trace the perimeter of the shield like this.
[258:18.49]And the shield appeared.
[258:20.99]Now throw these rocks at the hut and watch the shield.
[258:34.84]Alright, it's protected.
[258:45.17]the shield deflects the rocks now you can try shield the hut and I will attack it tap the shield medical and wait hold the action button what is this game I'm having a stroke this is black and white hey you've cast the medical marvelous the shield is ready
[259:19.51]Is there a throw rock spell or something that I'm missing?
[259:22.69]Thank you
[259:43.18]It's really hard to obtain and to install.
[259:45.38]Yeah, it's a pain in the ass.

[260:29.28]We're gonna do an attack?
[260:30.12]As you near Lethus, it will become more essential to have your miracle skills in top form.
[260:36.12]For this, you must experience the benefit of gestures.
[260:41.15]You can charge miracles without having to return to your temple to select them.
[260:46.11]Move your hand in a spiral like this.
[260:53.04]Now select the miracle of your choice.
[260:56.00]Crane is selected like this.
[261:06.45]I can't see the symbols in the bottom right.
[261:10.07]They're cut off from me too.

[264:25.77]They like us.
[264:26.41]You need to fill up the village store with food.
[264:29.57]Apparently we still have to do this.
[264:36.15]Excellent.
[264:36.95]We have filled the village store.
[264:38.69]Oh, I was ahead of you.
[264:39.41]People are easily impressed.
[264:42.11]Time is not kind.
[264:43.81]You need to gain influence in the direction of our common enemy.
[264:48.08]Are you winning?
[264:50.40]I strongly encourage you to gain this town.
[264:53.90]Before I leave to defend my realm, I must tell you one more thing.
[265:03.78]You will notice you cannot do anything, even cast miracles outside of your influence.
[265:09.76]However, there is a way using the power of belief.
[265:15.69]You can reach outside the edge of your realm for short periods of time, but your influence is soon lost until your hand is returned to your realm.
[265:25.75]Hey, who's winning?
[265:32.75]All of us are.
[265:35.79]Alright, so make these... That was spicy.

[265:55.90]And...
[265:58.12]All the chili lime was not on any of the pieces of meat.
[266:01.37]I just did the thing where I opened it up and tilted the rest of the crumbs in my mouth and got every single chili that was in the whole bag.
[266:09.01]Okay.

[335:30.77]What's got into him?
[335:40.11]What the fuck?
[335:40.85]We've been poisoned.
[335:42.27]We can't work, we can't pray, and we can't worship you.
[335:46.45]Please help us.
[335:47.71]Poisoned?
[335:48.84]We should stop this plague from spreading.
[335:51.28]Let's find the source of this sickness and heal the ill.
[335:56.54]Stay out of here, Cal.
[336:00.98]Who is he talking to?
[336:03.11]Don't go in there, don't go in there.
[336:08.58]I found the source.
[336:11.16]Poisoned food.
[336:11.78]Alright, stay there.
[336:19.34]Ugh, that food looks rancid.
[336:34.26]Watch this.
[336:37.98]The village store is nearly out of food.
[336:41.27]The poison source is the village store.
[336:44.13]We can heal them now.
[336:48.47]Wait, was that the right guy?
[336:59.37]It was, right?
[337:08.47]What do you mean no?
[337:09.39]No?
[337:14.21]That was a neutral village.
[337:25.53]Oh my god, there's so much food here that I poisoned.
[337:33.23]Kill the undecided.
[337:34.71]Ha!
[337:37.17]Oh, there's so much food in here.
[337:46.07]Blue.

[337:46.98]I need a blue settlement.
[337:49.02]Blue?
[337:51.66]Alright, I'm gonna throw it over there.
[337:52.62]What's he doing?
[337:56.38]What?
[337:57.02]Alright, I'm throwing the food over there.
[338:03.53]You think I can make it?
[338:15.04]Where'd it go?
[338:22.34]This is his place.
[338:23.98]Look, he's floating around right there.
[338:25.08]There he is.
[338:26.04]This is his.
[338:27.18]That's him right there.
[338:28.02]Yeah, fuck it.
[338:28.57]Keep this poison.
[338:29.09]Alright, Whistle Cow.
[338:34.83]Why'd you come all the way back?
[338:44.15]Alright, so that was the source.
[338:46.09]So now what the fuck do I do?
[338:47.23]Heal?
[338:49.60]You got rid of the poison, but the people need to be healed.

[339:38.07]Nothing damp and sick.
[339:40.95]I don't think there's anything I can do for these people right now.
[339:47.94]I don't have heal...
[339:50.77]I mean, I could learn this one.
[339:53.25]Loving creature.
[339:55.69]What does that do?

[404:32.06]What the fuck are you talking about?
[404:44.83]What?
[404:50.71]Load the autosave.
[404:54.51]This is the autosave.
[405:04.12]What happened?
[405:07.66]It can't be.
[405:08.34]Hold on.
[405:10.66]No!
[405:10.98]What the fuck was that?! !
[405:16.31]What?
[405:17.79]Oh, no, no, no!
[405:19.51]No!
[405:20.47]Did it just save it right there?
[405:25.22]Oh, did I just fuck it?
[405:26.42]Is it over?
[405:27.44]Because I exited the game and it saved it after I exited the game?
[405:32.56]No, it loads up the autosave every time.
[405:37.71]I exited the game once and came back.
[405:42.89]Oh, no, that's so horrible.
[405:44.75]Hold on.
[405:50.00]Let me see if there's, like, more than one.
[405:51.38]Because, no, you remember, like, an hour or two ago, when I reopened the game, and it put us back in the right spot with an autosave?
[406:02.77]So, let me see.
[406:04.76]Let me just see if I go back in.
[406:14.09]What happens?
[406:16.82]Go into your saves folder.
[406:18.18]I don't even know what the hell that is.
[406:20.26]Let's see.
[406:22.12]Black and white.
[406:23.82]Profiles.
[406:25.96]Saved games.
[406:28.76]Alright, I have... What the hell?
[406:35.23]8.56pm?
[406:37.21]And then... Nah, this is all wrong.
[406:41.83]8.56pm was literally two minutes ago.
[406:46.10]I don't think this is correct, though.
[406:49.33]Let me go in the temple.
[406:50.45]8.56 p.m.
[406:54.71]is the one that I just did.
[406:57.27]When I exited.
[407:00.65]No!
[407:03.79]I'm going to back up the folder.
[407:07.23]This is fucking weird, though.
[407:08.39]Alright, so the last apparently saved game I have is from 6 p.m.
[407:15.12]That's why it went back that far.
[407:16.48]Why?
[407:18.10]There's been at least four or five different times where it's autosaved.
[407:28.05]That's unfortunate.
[407:28.79]Hold on.
[407:29.09]Let me just go in and see if I can pick something else.
[407:34.61]Oh, I was just getting into it, too.
[407:36.45]Let me see what happens.
[407:50.52]Okay, let's go in the temple.
[407:54.84]Yeah, because look at this.
[407:55.98]This is completely wrong.
[407:58.04]This is literally the beginning of the level.
[408:00.56]Not even close.
[408:01.22]Like, I've... We've... I've autosaved, like, ten... I've... This is wrong.
[408:07.12]Like, completely wrong.
[408:08.12]Unless the whole thing corrupted and broke.
[408:11.56]Which, I mean, that's pretty possible.
[408:12.68]It's a fucking, like, almost 20-year-old game.
[408:16.64]Um... Game options room?
[408:17.78]What do I try?
[408:18.32]Look at it.
[408:24.02]Save game room?
[408:32.90]The problem with this is though... Don't save the game.
[408:35.48]I was told that this room doesn't work.
[408:37.34]I was told this crashes the game.
[408:38.61]What's up here?
[408:39.27]Hold on.
[408:57.55]842, wait a minute.
[409:01.18]Boys and girls, we're fucking good to go.
[409:02.42]That's 842 p.m.
[409:03.58]on Wednesday, January 8th.
[409:06.70]Hold on, what's the other one?
[409:12.13]854 p.m.
[409:12.57]on January 8th.
[409:13.25]That has to be it.
[409:16.85]830, yeah, it has to be that one.
[409:22.49]It's 854.
[409:23.62]That's the one.
[409:29.46]You want to load this game?
[409:30.60]Yeah.
[409:36.94]Here it is.
[409:39.33]You're crazy.
[409:39.95]Yes!
[409:40.61]Oh, I'm so happy.
[409:41.85]Thank God.
[409:43.83]Your creature wants to be kind and generous.
[409:48.27]Hooray.
[409:52.03]But!
[409:54.15]I am going to take this time.
[409:55.44]It's been about seven hours.
[410:00.59]Don't please... Alright, wait, wait, they love me, they love me.
[410:05.95]Alright, wait, wait, wait, here comes like the Five Nights at Freddy's character.
[410:08.83]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[410:12.37]This creature's tired.
[410:15.90]Alright, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.
[410:17.34]We're not ready for this fight.
[410:19.74]Come here.
[410:24.30]Miracle food.
[410:25.64]Miracle f- what?
[410:26.86]No power.
[410:29.82]Alright, everybody loves me.
[410:30.98]Get out.
[410:32.14]He's coming.
[410:36.02]Wait, hold on.
[410:39.65]Get out of here!
[411:00.80]Oh, shit.
[411:01.24]Wait, wait, wait.
[411:01.64]Turn around.
[411:01.92]Turn around.

[411:51.07]I don't know what the move is because I cut off all my fucking screen!
[411:56.33]What is it?
[412:00.65]It's a U?
[412:01.17]That ain't a U?
[412:09.54]What's going on?
[412:10.18]Oh, fuck.
[412:21.03]Heal, heal, heal.
[412:22.63]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[412:26.35]Heal.
[412:27.89]He just struck himself on fire.
[412:29.61]I need water.
[412:32.39]Water?
[412:32.89]Stupid.
[412:37.17]Die!
[412:37.73]Die!
[412:37.93]Die!

[413:42.98]Let's go.
[413:43.54]You wanna go?
[413:47.32]Fight him!
[413:50.12]No, shit!
[413:52.26]Fight him, what is that?
[413:54.46]What is he doing?
[413:55.52]What is he- Oh, rocks!
[414:01.04]Fight him!
[414:04.23]What is he doing?

[414:38.00]He tried to be his friend.
[414:39.74]I'm not using the friendship leash.
[414:42.87]I have the aggressive one on.
[414:47.95]Oh my god.
[415:08.64]Look at all the burn marks all over this guy.
[415:19.36]Where is he?
[415:19.80]What do you mean that's not the enemy?
[415:25.89]That's Blue.
[415:28.41]I have to go to Blue.
[415:29.93]Blue attacks me.
[415:30.79]That's Blue.
[415:31.75]Blue is the enemy.
[415:36.73]He's coming back over here.
[415:43.68]That is the enemy.
[415:44.54]I know it is.
[415:45.50]You can't bait it.
[415:46.30]Alright.
[415:46.73]What are you talking about?
[415:48.49]Alright, heal.
[415:49.15]Look, I'm good.
[415:51.37]You like me, right?
[415:53.03]You like me a lot.
[415:54.19]Where's the cowl?
[416:09.47]He's coming back.
[416:10.19]Alright.
[416:10.97]This is where I've gotta fucking kill that thing.
[416:13.41]I have to kill that motherfucker.
[416:18.46]There's a D for heal.
[416:27.54]That's a heart.
[416:33.52]I don't understand.
[416:34.76]What the fuck is that?
[416:41.53]I don't know why he's walking all the way over here on his own.
[416:44.27]Who draws a heart like that?
[416:45.43]What are you talking about?
[416:47.31]Heart.
[416:58.61]What?
[416:58.89]You understand what I'm trying?
[417:00.45]Alright, he's good.
[417:07.91]He needs to eat.
[417:12.60]Should we do some more strength training?
[417:17.18]Take this.
[417:18.30]Whatever.
[417:19.62]I got this.
[417:25.66]Now don't throw it.
[417:26.44]Walk.
[417:27.12]Oh, you idiot.
[417:27.80]Actually, he threw that pretty far.
[417:28.88]He must have better strength.
[417:31.20]Alright.
[417:32.10]I need to eat.
[417:32.94]He needs to eat.
[417:33.38]Go eat.
[417:41.07]Take up the mean lash.
[417:44.11]Leash, whatever the fuck the damn thing is.
[417:45.93]Hang out in here for now.
[417:48.19]Uh, you need to eat.
[417:49.13]Eat something.
[417:50.65]Have some grain.
[417:59.42]Eat it.
[418:03.67]Good.
[418:04.21]Okay.
[418:04.49]Take a nap.
[418:06.17]And then we're gonna go take over that fucking village.
[418:08.69]We're gonna go kill that guy.
[418:13.26]We're going to kill that guy.
[418:17.37]You have food.
[418:19.75]But I will give you more.
[418:24.71]Good.
[418:27.67]Alright, he's just going.
[418:34.54]Did you sleep yet?
[418:36.88]Aggressive.
[418:39.92]Let's go.
[418:41.96]What is this?
[418:48.09]Alright, I don't care.
[419:17.65]That's not what I care about right now.
[419:18.99]I care about killing this guy.
[419:27.13]I want to do moves in the middle of a fight.
[419:32.26]And I did it once.
[419:36.30]I wonder if he does it on his own, or if I have to command him to do those moves.
[419:53.96]Alright, let's go.
[419:55.92]What we got over here?
[419:56.66]We got some shit over here.
[419:57.48]Free storm.
[419:57.70]Free storm.
[419:57.92]There it goes.
[419:58.30]Free storm and free heal.
[419:58.86]Gonna use it right now.
[420:00.50]And then also free lightning.
[420:23.87]Where's that fucking cat?
[420:26.33]What is he doing?
[420:48.10]Nice, I mean we both...
[420:50.34]We're both not really doing much.
[420:52.58]Alright, get in here.
[420:53.52]Take it over.
[420:55.62]Did I do it?
[421:04.15]This is my ally.
[421:05.53]You have failed me.
[421:07.43]I, Nemesis, have arrived to take control.
[421:16.91]But I will not let them threaten my destiny.
[421:21.13]I will be the only God.
[421:23.47]What is this?
[421:25.23]What about the turtle?
[421:28.99]Oh, no.
[421:31.05]Can we save the turtle?
[421:32.57]You have defied me for the last time.
[421:36.01]Nemesis, no!
[421:39.03]I know your creature hides a part of the creed inside him.
[421:43.93]I do not need it.
[421:45.51]I already have the power that three combined creeds bring.
[421:50.30]And I will use
[421:59.30]What about all these people?
[422:04.19]No!
[422:07.81]We didn't even get to meet this turtle.
[422:10.25]But I still feel sad.
[422:21.23]I have to get it.
[422:22.24]Oh shit, I gotta get it too.
[422:24.24]Alright, go get it.
[422:25.26]Okay.
[423:04.96]Where's the creature?
[423:09.10]I'm in game?
[423:10.26]I am not in game.
[423:27.72]Is this creature across the whole game?
[423:30.00]Did I fuck it up when I started?
[423:31.48]Oh, I must have screwed it up.
[423:36.76]He was really far away from when I was fighting him.
[423:47.67]He had to run from across the whole map.
[423:58.39]He's doing the gerbil walk.
[424:06.53]I can't believe it!
[424:08.25]Kazaar wiped out like a bug!
[424:11.45]I understand what the old guide meant now.
[424:14.62]The power of three creeds must be combined.
[424:17.82]But Nemesis said he has three creeds!
[424:21.04]Yes, but he's after the others to stop us getting them.
[424:25.04]We've got to get them then!
[424:27.20]Absolutely.
[424:34.03]What the hell do you want me to do about this?
[424:38.85]What do you want me to do now?
[424:42.41]What the fuck am I doing?
[424:46.67]Do I have to go through the portal?
[424:49.97]What is all this shit?
[424:55.61]Head to yellow?
[424:56.37]Alright, I'm going to go to yellow.
[425:02.42]Take over the land.
[425:07.94]I mean, it might just keep taking blue.
[425:16.10]Where is my creature?
[425:22.59]Pick that up.
[425:29.05]No.
[425:31.29]Good throw, though.
[425:34.84]An enemy is trying to influence your village.
[425:37.48]Whack him!
[425:38.92]Um... What the fuck are you talking about?
[425:45.55]Alright, I need heal.
[425:59.50]Do I not have heal?
[426:00.50]Oh, I lost heal.
[426:02.38]Here, look.
[426:04.08]Look at me.
[426:04.86]Believe in me.
[426:06.29]Cool.
[426:07.23]Is anybody even still alive here?
[426:15.87]You have a lot of food.
[426:16.95]I'm taking almost all of it.
[426:22.92]Go through the portal.
[426:26.18]Where'd the portal even open?
[426:32.02]Look at how much food is in here.
[426:46.55]What are you doing with that rock?
[426:50.47]Why are you carrying a rock?
[426:54.37]He's just killing animals.
[426:55.41]Okay.
[427:02.40]He's going cow bowling.
[427:04.78]Okay.
[427:06.06]Okay.
[427:06.34]Okay.
[427:06.56]Okay.

[427:26.00]Everybody has food and shit.

[427:32.03]Where's my temple?
[427:40.59]Okay, let's go.
[427:43.79]Apparently we need wood.
[427:46.04]I'll take it from... I don't even fucking know.
[427:51.20]There's so many places right now.
[427:52.40]I don't even know what my goal is.
[427:54.90]Just to walk in the portal?
[428:10.26]I have to get the rest of the towns.
[428:17.55]Do I have to capture blue?
[428:18.55]Oh, okay.
[428:18.83]Alright, um... Where do I need to bring this to?
[428:27.02]Over here.
[428:29.78]Here's your wood.
[428:31.70]Look.
[428:33.04]Like me now?
[428:40.70]Here, start working on stuff.
[428:42.96]Oh, are they?
[428:47.12]Okay, so this is good.
[428:47.94]Now, where's this other blue village?
[428:51.90]Up there, okay.
[428:53.16]Let's go take this one over.

[430:25.92]Yeah.
[430:27.16]Yeah, he is angry.
[430:30.74]Be angry.
[430:32.84]What are you holding?
[430:33.86]Is that a dead body?
[430:37.27]What is that?

[431:02.74]Okay, now heal yourself.
[431:13.87]Did it just bounce?
[431:23.91]Do it!
[431:24.97]Nice job.
[431:25.65]Okay, at this time, I don't... You just do it.
[431:30.43]Because, like, I fucking can't, apparently.
[431:32.35]Like, I don't understand the trajectory.
[431:34.15]Go ahead in here and torch this place.
[431:48.11]Are they kicking this... Are they beating up this bird?
[432:01.73]Eat the bird.
[432:02.15]Eat the bird.
[432:02.85]Eat that bird.
[432:04.56]Eat it.
[432:04.78]Alright, take this place out.
[432:17.35]He's realized he likes the taste of birds.
[432:24.49]Burn!
[432:25.47]There it is.
[432:25.99]Alright, do you think...
[432:35.91]He's pointing and laughing.

[433:08.36]Heal.
[433:11.20]Fuck.
[433:11.44]Fuck.
[433:11.58]Watch out.
[433:11.84]Watch out.
[433:12.04]He's doing it again.
[433:12.44]He's doing it again.
[433:12.88]Watch out.
[433:13.12]Watch out.
[433:19.23]Alright.
[433:19.51]Heal.
[433:21.41]Do a healing spell.
[433:25.45]Eat.
[433:25.89]Just eat a shitload of this.
[433:34.84]Here.
[433:35.92]Eat.
[433:37.44]Eat this.
[433:37.78]I don't know where you're going.
[433:40.39]Eat this.
[433:40.73]What?
[433:42.67]What was that?
[433:54.00]What was that?
[433:58.28]What was that?
[434:00.24]Did he heal?
[434:00.94]What was that?
[434:03.20]Oh no!
[434:03.74]No!
[434:03.94]Okay, eat!
[434:04.54]Eat something!
[434:07.74]You have 95% hunger.
[434:08.89]Eat!
[434:09.07]Go!
[434:09.49]Leave!
[434:23.44]How could you be this hungry?
[434:56.99]He needs to eat.
[435:02.53]Is there any livestock?
[435:11.17]Eat it.
[435:14.88]Eat them.
[435:18.10]Heal.
[435:23.15]Heal him?
[435:23.79]I don't have heal anymore.
[435:28.33]I don't have heal anymore.
[435:29.29]See?
[435:29.51]It's like I don't have it.
[435:31.77]I think I lost it.
[435:46.23]Fireball.
[435:52.73]Got it!
[435:53.65]Got it!
[435:54.85]Get in!
[435:56.43]Again!
[435:56.67]Do it again!
[436:09.74]Burn it down!
[436:11.94]Stop pointing at shit and burn something down!
[436:18.30]There you go!
[436:18.90]Good job!
[436:24.22]Keep going.
[436:26.34]Good.
[436:27.78]He hit the edge.
[436:32.42]He's pissed.
[436:34.41]Lightning!
[436:35.71]Yes.
[436:37.87]You're doing a fantastic job.
[436:40.03]Ooh, ooh, watch it, watch it, watch it.
[436:48.16]God damn it.
[436:55.92]Ain't got nothing.
[437:01.56]Keep torching it.
[437:02.78]Kill everybody.
[437:04.64]Just get it.
[437:04.98]You know what?
[437:05.42]Go up here.
[437:13.03]More destruction.
[437:17.49]You know what to do.
[437:18.51]Do something.
[437:19.05]Burn everything.
[437:19.55]Kill everything.
[437:21.51]Fireball.
[437:33.65]Okay, alright.
[437:34.17]Did I win?
[437:35.03]Take it out!
[437:38.75]Yeah!
[437:39.69]He's going to bed.
[438:10.63]Where did that go?
[438:19.16]Keep going.
[438:23.09]Fireball's so hard to use.
[438:25.29]I need him to do it.
[438:25.95]Alright, unleash.
[438:30.45]Unleash him.
[438:31.25]Let him do whatever he wants.
[438:46.28]I need 322 Belief.
[438:47.90]Oh my, release him again.
[438:50.90]He's gonna get himself fucking killed if you stand still.
[439:06.54]Kill.
[439:08.06]You're attached.
[439:09.40]Do something!
[439:11.24]Do anything!
[439:15.44]We didn't, actually, because they're still here!
[439:22.56]There we go!
[439:26.33]More!
[439:29.59]More!
[439:29.87]Do it again!
[439:32.47]Bingo.
[439:33.07]Right into the heart.
[439:34.59]Nice job.
[439:39.94]Torch it.
[439:47.92]Again.
[439:48.12]This is... pet him to keep having him keep doing it.
[440:00.87]He's hungry.
[440:03.63]Fuck!
[440:04.09]I didn't mean to do that!
[440:05.15]I tried to pet him!
[440:07.04]Don't be so destructive!
[440:08.18]Oh my fucking god.
[440:09.76]I'm trying to pet him and it just hits him.
[440:22.62]Eat.
[440:22.86]Eat again.
[440:31.24]Alright, kill.
[440:40.23]Dude, this is taking a fucking long time.
[440:58.37]Wow, how many times do I have to burn this thing down?
[441:19.92]How much more belief do I need?
[441:21.92]Alright, he's full health.
[441:27.76]You know what?
[441:28.32]Fuck it.
[441:28.70]Go up here.
[441:30.00]Go up to, like, the temple.
[441:32.90]Burn this fucking thing to the ground.
[441:39.97]Take it out.
[441:43.27]Get up there.
[441:50.84]It's outside my influence, but it's not.
[441:54.18]It's not.
[441:58.10]My red circle is right here.
[442:03.76]Alright, heal.
[442:17.40]Destroy it.
[442:19.07]Do it!
[442:26.51]I don't understand what I'm supposed to do here.
[442:28.69]He's, like, not even alive.
[442:34.87]I'm supposed to destroy the temple.
[442:38.66]Well, he... How much mana do you have?
[442:51.00]You don't even have any shit left.
[442:52.24]You...
[442:54.50]Alright, this dude doesn't even have anything left.
[442:57.34]Where is he getting the ability to do that?
[442:59.67]I swear to God.
[443:07.21]This guy has no towns.
[443:09.55]Yet he can cast a lightning bolt every five seconds.
[443:21.14]We're getting toasted here, boss.
[443:29.08]His other village is unharmed.
[443:30.60]This motherfucker doesn't even have another village!
[443:35.69]This ain't his village!
[443:41.40]This is mine!
[443:57.31]one of your villages has very high desires this isn't good news leader this is my land leave oh my god I'm never gonna take it
[444:25.31]They need... Yes, I'm gonna... Okay, I'll give you wood.
[444:27.52]I'll give you wood.
[444:28.18]Fine.
[444:28.48]Sure.
[444:28.80]Here.
[444:35.98]How much more until you cut the shit out?
[444:37.34]359, if I can believe.
[444:37.88]That's...
[444:53.38]So I have to dump like 70,000 wood over there.
[444:56.52]Or burn it to the ground.
[445:06.47]Light a rock on fire.
[445:07.69]Time for cheats?
[445:12.18]I have all these followers.
[445:13.42]Just give me a...
[445:19.90]Just make them love you.
[445:20.80]Give them food.
[445:21.48]Yeah, that just gave me 11 belief.
[445:25.34]For almost 7,000 wood.
[445:41.05]Here.
[445:42.65]This 10,000 wood.
[445:47.05]I almost got it.
[445:47.57]I almost got it.
[445:47.97]I almost got it.
[445:48.41]Do that one more time.
[446:02.70]send peeps and missionaries over there?
[446:04.88]I don't even... I didn't even do that tutorial.
[446:11.60]I don't even know how to do that.
[446:17.34]Was that even an available tutorial to do?
[446:19.05]Did I win?
[446:30.99]You are truly a powerful god, but you failed to defeat me.
[446:37.94]Let's see how powerful you are without your creature.
[446:41.56]Look!
[446:42.02]He's heading for the vortex!
[446:43.70]He's mesmerized!
[446:45.44]The creature!
[446:46.46]Get him on a leash, quickly!
[447:15.09]No, he's gone through and so is werfus.
[447:18.76]Lethis has taken our creature.
[447:20.78]What are we going to do?
[447:22.06]We're going to get him back.
[447:24.88]Let's go through.
[447:26.24]Yes.
[447:26.74]No.
[447:27.40]Let's think about this.
[447:28.63]It could be a trap.
[447:30.25]No, there ain't time to think.
[447:32.27]The vortex is closing.
[447:34.03]But we don't know what's on the other side.
[447:36.81]Our creature's on the other side.
[447:39.03]That's all we need to know.
[447:40.38]Let's go.
[447:47.07]Is it actually closing?
[447:48.05]Get it!
[447:48.31]Go!
[447:48.67]Go!
[447:49.77]What?
[448:08.38]No, they got him trapped.
[448:10.94]How do I do it?
[448:13.56]Oh no.
[448:13.72]Oh boy.
[448:41.41]Well, uh-huh.
[448:51.34]It's our village store.
[448:52.42]That's it right there.
[448:55.20]That was fucking so fun, though.
[448:59.17]I love that little cow.
[449:00.33]Alright, how do I, um, do I have any abilities?
[449:10.19]I think we need to get this village built.
[449:12.33]Yeah, but I don't have any... Yeah, we gotta be strong for when we get our creature back.
[449:16.33]This place will give us a foundation to fight from.
[449:19.21]I don't... Do I have any actual villagers, though?
[449:23.93]Are you guys?
[449:27.17]Are you... I guess you are.
[449:29.37]Okay.
[449:31.61]Come over here and build this.
[449:33.06]Disciple builder.
[449:40.93]Oh, they're building up a temple right now.
[449:47.36]I see.
[449:47.60]Alright, yeah, that's it.
[449:53.18]That's it.
[449:53.94]I'm gonna call it for tonight.
[449:55.44]We may depend... Tomorrow, we may come back tomorrow.
[449:59.31]It's been seven and a half hours.
[450:01.65]I don't want... I didn't want to stream for more than seven, eight... Nah, I don't want to stream for like ten hours.
[450:08.07]So, we may do this tomorrow.
[450:10.58]If not tomorrow, then I'm going to probably do Katana ZERO tomorrow.
[450:14.98]But, we'll see.
[450:17.00]I might play this tomorrow.
[450:24.12]He lied about the 10 hour stream, kind of.
[450:27.37]But, this is like really... I love this game.
[450:32.63]Some of this shit was so stupid.
[450:35.87]Oh, what a great game.
[450:37.75]Alright, it's saved.
[450:41.13]Yeah, it'll save right here.
[450:44.81]Keep playing it?
[450:45.71]Yeah.
[450:46.69]I'll get better at managing stuff too.
[450:50.87]We'll do it again tomorrow.
[450:52.41]We'll do it again tomorrow and if it gets a little stale after like a couple hours, we'll move on to something else.
[451:00.66]But let's do the bits and subs and everything.
[451:03.83]Thanks for joining me as always.
[451:05.47]We'll see you tomorrow.
[451:07.57]Same time.
[451:09.37]Around 1 to 2 p.m.
[451:10.63]Pacific.
[451:12.81]We'll see you tomorrow.
[451:21.44]First stream?
[451:22.60]Welcome.
[451:29.65]Do the other night's bits.
[451:32.61]Yeah, I'll pull those up.
[451:33.89]I'm gonna do them very, very quickly, though.
[451:36.79]Just because we have, uh, looks like a lot to go through tonight, too.
[451:43.24]So, I don't wanna have everybody sitting here, potentially, for the next two or three hours.
[451:47.02]Because then it will be a ten-hour stream.
[451:51.94]It will be a ten-hour stream.
[451:55.42]But, we'll see you tomorrow.
[451:56.84]Let's go back a few days ago.
[451:58.28]Uh, this is when...
[452:05.09]I got cut off.
[452:07.87]It was this one here.
[452:08.73]Doctor, Officer, Fireman.
[452:09.79]Here we are.
[452:10.11]Alright, we'll go through these.
[452:12.89]I'm going to do them quickly.
[452:15.64]And we'll move on to today's.
[452:17.80]Pizza tier list.
[452:18.64]I can do that whenever.
[452:20.48]We had $50 a few days ago.
[452:22.08]Remember, this was all from four days ago.
[452:23.74]So some of these things people might be saying might be completely inaccurate for today.
[452:29.53]But they say Jerma is the police.
[452:31.15]I was playing the police, fire, and EMT game.
[452:36.17]So, they say, Jerma is the police MonkaS.
[452:39.11]Thank you, Phylactery, for the... It seems like every single stream you give more than $50 to $100 in bits.
[452:45.90]It's crazy.
[452:46.46]Or subs.
[452:47.84]Thank you.
[452:49.44]Thank you.
[452:49.74]I really appreciate that.
[452:50.48]Thanks for sticking around.
[453:21.04]Thanks for watching.
[453:24.68]T. Yik, thanks for the 500 bits.
[453:28.10]Crowrad, thanks for the 500 bits.
[453:29.48]This game is kind of quiet without music.
[453:31.16]Could you play Happy Rock?
[453:33.20]I don't know what that is.
[453:33.88]Phylactery gave another fucking 5,000 bits again.
[453:38.86]Like I told you before.
[453:40.80]He does it every stream.
[453:42.72]It's crazy.
[453:45.81]We were trying to call ambulances.
[453:47.57]Seeing how many we can call at once.
[453:50.61]They said, need you to find out how many aimplaces we can call at once.
[453:52.75]I think it was like four.
[453:55.55]I got out of that game, though.
[453:58.39]SpliceableSpleen, thanks for the 500 bits.
[454:00.09]Hey, Jerma, I just wanted to let you know how much your streams have meant to me over the past year.
[454:04.90]You're an amazing entertainer.
[454:07.18]Hope you feel loved and appreciated on the New Year's stream for everything you do on stream.
[454:13.40]I do.
[454:13.93]I very much do.
[454:14.47]Absolutely.
[454:16.25]Absolutely.
[454:18.96]Thank you.
[454:20.50]Trust me when I say I feel very, very much super loved.
[454:26.47]The channel crossed 10,000 subs on New Year's Eve, so it's like, what else can I even say?
[454:31.73]Like, it's been a fucking wild ride.
[454:33.49]They also say, I want you to let you know that I was indeed the Nancy Drew one guy.
[454:38.55]It started as a simple suggestion, but it blew out of proportion.
[454:41.63]I'm sorry.
[454:43.83]Hey, don't apologize.
[454:44.71]Don't ever apologize for fucking... Don't ever apologize for being the smartest person in the room.
[454:49.40]You know what I'm saying?
[454:57.52]Thank you, NeverElectra for the thousand bits.
[455:00.01]Thanks for helping with my depression, my dude.
[455:03.63]If you get something from this stream... I hope it makes you feel better.
[455:09.71]Thank you.
[455:14.27]Thank you, Neva Electra.
[455:15.27]Yeah, I think I actually read that one.
[455:18.31]And Neva Electra, again, thanks for the $28.
[455:20.49]2,800 bits.
[455:20.69]Your bullshit helps.
[455:21.33]I'm going through a rough time.
[455:45.73]Much love to you.
[455:50.85]Join the Discord community if you haven't.
[455:52.55]There's a shitload of people there that are just hanging out, having a good time.
[455:59.98]And if you are going through a really, really, really rough time, I really implore you to seek out somebody that can help you.
[456:09.07]Because it's one thing to be able to forget about it for a little while and hang out on a stream and just chill and fuck around with some friends and buddies and stuff.
[456:17.11]But it's another thing to try to make sure that you stay healthy and to actually, you know, help yourself and treat yourself.
[456:24.67]Whether that's with somebody that's a professional or through a medical means, right?
[456:33.56]Just make sure you're going through all the avenues you need to.
[456:40.86]I wish you the best of luck.
[456:41.68]Thank you.
[456:42.72]For the... 2,800 bits.
[456:46.18]Thanks a lot.
[456:47.82]Noodle is bad at gaming.
[456:48.70]Thanks for the 250.
[456:49.20]Remember, that dream is gonna haunt me forever, but at least the wound from that splinter that sent me to the ER is almost healed.
[456:56.01]Hope you had a great past couple days.
[456:58.87]Hope you had a great couple days, too.
[457:01.53]And... Eat more, like, fucking vitamin D or something, so you don't have dreams of me having sex on stream.
[457:12.22]Speaking of dreams.
[457:14.60]Hikikikoromosunday gave 300 bits.
[457:18.41]Jeremy, I'm back with another dream story.
[457:20.21]Right after that.
[457:22.17]You were holding some big meetup concert event at a stadium, and the tickets sold out in five minutes.
[457:26.91]So I got to the stadium and had to fix my makeup, so I went to this huge unisex bathroom and saw some of the people from the Discord subchat were there, and for some reason we were like, let's have a pre-event party in here.
[457:38.43]So we had a rave in the restroom and I sent out a Snapchat message to everyone.
[457:44.21]What the fuck is going on?
[457:51.09]A rave in the bathroom.
[457:53.90]Well, uh... Bathrooms stink.
[457:59.25]I can't be in a public bathroom for more than two or three minutes tops.
[458:03.53]It just smells like pee.
[458:05.47]It smells like wet piss in every public bathroom I've ever been in.
[458:07.90]You know what I mean?
[458:08.50]You guys know what I'm talking about.
[458:10.46]It's like a wet, humid pee smell.
[458:13.46]I hate it.
[458:13.76]Hey, Freudian Weapon, thanks for the $6.50.
[458:19.62]Happy Saturday.
[458:20.22]Happy Saturday.
[458:20.92]Well, it's not Saturday anymore, but happy Saturday when it was Saturday.
[458:25.75]Swiggity-swanky, thanks for the 250.
[458:27.15]Possible one-guy moment here.
[458:28.65]Okay.
[458:30.31]This game nostalgically reminds me of the, of a Simcopter.
[458:35.29]A SimCity flight simulator.
[458:37.98]Where you do similar tasks like in this game, but flying in a chopper.
[458:42.02]Huh.
[458:46.20]I still have to play, like, SimCity for real.
[458:49.60]What's the easy one?
[458:50.86]What's the one that was easy?
[458:53.94]Cities Skylines?
[458:56.46]That's the easier, the better one.
[458:59.54]The one that's more streamlined and easier to understand is Cities Skylines.
[459:07.41]Yeah, maybe.
[459:09.11]Hamster the Pie, thanks for the 250.
[459:10.59]Hi, I'm from Ireland, but I spent the last summer working in Boston.

[459:18.56]Had a great time there with friends.

[460:03.30]But yeah, it's a lot of fun.
[460:07.08]It is a lot of fun.
[460:10.05]But yeah, that's the first baseball club in your college in Ireland.
[460:15.95]Well, maybe it'll take off.
[460:17.17]It's a great sport.

[461:32.45]What?
[461:35.33]You smacked the table.
[461:40.13]No, that's... But seriously, that's an insanely nice thing to say about anybody.
[461:45.43]If I am your inspiration and role model, I'm honored.
[461:50.68]I don't even know what to say.
[461:53.20]People say that sometimes.
[461:54.26]I'm just glad you're having fun.
[462:02.63]Shit and fart laughing, right.
[462:05.49]Lesbian Bigfoot, thanks for the $30.
[462:06.71]3,000 bits.
[462:08.27]Thanks for the hilarious content.
[462:11.53]Your streams helped me get through a really tough time last year.
[462:13.71]And helped me to find the humor in things again.
[462:16.06]Here's to another great year.
[462:24.94]Thank you.
[462:26.66]Thanks for the huge money drop.
[462:29.49]I'm sorry to hear about you having not a great time last year.
[462:33.21]But let's hope 2020 improves and is much better than 2019.
[462:37.51]You know what I'm saying?
[462:42.42]Emmanuel Depressed, thanks for the 400 bits.
[462:44.08]Jeremiah, when are you going to finally take the moral high ground for once and endorse Anthony Banthony for president?
[462:49.36]You're fence-sitting and refusing to condemn his opponent, Dean Dingus, who I might add strangled three people, shows a clear lack of integrity.
[462:59.55]My political endorsement was fucking Benjamin Franklin.
[463:02.16]There you go.
[463:06.18]There you go.
[463:07.98]Anthony Banthony or Dean Dingus, Benjamin Franklin.
[463:14.99]Motherfucker wasn't even a president and he got on the 100.
[463:16.83]Okay?
[463:17.37]Whoa.
[463:18.93]Whoa.
[463:24.51]Son of Jenova, thanks for the $2.50.
[463:25.47]Hi, Jerma.
[463:27.21]Please consider cutting the last empty frames of jermaWalk so it's a constant gif.
[463:32.61]Actually, I did not make jermaWalk.
[463:34.09]It is a community emote from BetterTwitch.TV.
[463:37.57]I did not make it.
[463:41.03]And another Jerma pops up as soon as the first Jerma walks away from the screen.
[463:46.07]I don't know.
[463:46.61]I didn't make it.
[463:47.47]I just enabled it.
[463:51.67]That is a community BetterTwitch.TV emote
[463:57.04]I would direct that feedback towards the person that made that emote.
[464:02.56]How do I see it?
[464:03.26]You have to have better twitch.tv.
[464:07.73]You made it on an alt account.
[464:10.03]Lizard Amiibo, thanks for the 1500 bits, Lizard.
[464:13.33]I could make this really long, but I just want to say thank you.
[464:15.59]You've had such a positive impact on my life this past year by inspiring me to be kinder and to pursue what I care about.
[464:26.60]Thanks for building such an incredible community and for helping to convince me that things are going to work out in ways I don't expect.
[464:33.99]That's true.
[464:36.89]That's the thing about life is some things will happen that you aren't prepared for.
[464:43.66]Some things will happen that you are prepared for.
[464:45.56]Some things will happen that you want to have happen.
[464:47.50]Some things will happen that you don't want to have happen.
[464:50.42]And some things will happen that you want to have happen that you didn't even know you wanted in the first place.
[464:58.12]So... it's a weird thing.
[465:09.66]That's Five Head.
[465:10.42]I mean, it's not... that wasn't a riddle.
[465:14.84]Break it down.
[465:15.41]Break down what I said.
[465:18.29]Pretty much what I'm saying is life is unpredictable.
[465:21.61]And even if you think you want to do something or you want X...
[465:25.99]why might show up, and you go, oh wow, that's fucking awesome, that's exactly what I wanted.
[465:35.81]Happens all the time to people.
[465:46.00]That sounds like a riddle.
[465:48.72]That's not, how, what?
[465:50.74]Life is unpredictable.
[465:52.14]What's this riddle the streamer is saying?
[465:55.10]Hmm.
[465:58.24]What is this?
[466:05.81]Anyways, thank you, Lizard Amiibo.
[466:07.15]Thanks for the 1500 fucking bits.
[466:14.08]Ooh, I must make straight... What?
[466:15.88]Say what?
[466:18.76]Stix Renegade, thanks for the 250.
[466:19.84]I remember before that you were talking about your car months ago.
[466:22.32]Tell me, how much do you know about your vehicle maintenance?
[466:24.70]I'm curious.
[466:25.20]None.
[466:25.30]None.
[466:29.40]If something bad happened to my car, I would not be able to fix it.
[466:32.32]I would have to call somebody.
[466:34.78]The only thing I know how to do is tell people that I know how to change a tire when I don't.
[466:42.61]And some of you guys can sneer.
[466:46.50]How many of you do that too?
[466:49.42]Hey, you know how to change a tire, right?
[466:51.12]Of course I do.
[466:52.04]What, are you an idiot?
[466:54.20]Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, I know, yeah.
[466:56.16]I also don't fucking know how to change a tire, and I'm asking you, but nobody knows how to change a tire.
[467:08.73]The only people that know how to change a tire are car mechanics and your dad if he's at least 50 years old.
[467:18.18]Nobody else does.
[467:29.53]It's so easy.
[467:30.23]No, it's not.
[467:30.59]It's very hard.
[467:31.44]It's impossible.
[467:32.98]It's too scary.
[467:41.76]Get a Jack.
[467:42.61]Jacket changed.
[467:43.27]Alright, now it's too scary.
[467:44.01]That's terrifying.
[467:44.65]That's too scary.
[467:45.69]What if the car falls on my hands and it flattens like two pancakes?
[467:48.83]I'm not doing that.
[467:50.33]I need like a professional.
[467:58.22]That's a level 1 skill?
[467:59.62]No, a level 1 skill is turning the shower on.
[468:09.44]Like, that's a level 1 skill.
[468:21.79]No, I don't know shit about car maintenance.
[468:23.21]I know about tire pressure, and when the engine light turns on, to take it somewhere.
[468:30.92]I also know how to put windshield washer fluid in a car.
[468:34.38]I mean, that's not hard.
[468:35.92]Do I know how to do my own oil change- I don't know how to do an oil- I don't do my own oil changes!
[468:48.42]Why are we talking like this is some basic knowledge?
[468:50.62]Everyone changes their own oil?
[468:55.10]Guys, there are like Burger King type shops every two miles to change oil.
[469:00.77]It's one of the biggest businesses in the country.
[469:16.23]An oil change is like sixteen dollars It's not like a thousand dollars to have somebody change your oil It takes 16 minutes
[469:37.81]Alright, I don't know if I'm getting trolled here, but I don't know anyone out of the dozens of people that I've ever come across in my life, none of them change their own oil.
[469:50.66]Not one person does.
[469:52.34]Not one.
[469:53.64]I'm talking to my family, I'm talking to friends, literally none of them.
[470:09.65]Rich, rich guy?
[470:12.39]What?
[470:13.17]I'm fucking freaking out right now.
[470:15.67]How much is an oil change?
[470:17.09]It's like fucking $20.
[470:17.81]It's $25 and $50 being the most expensive like in the world.
[470:27.16]It's $20.
[470:36.05]You spent more money on Hearthstone cards two or three years ago.
[470:39.31]Give me a break.
[470:47.85]I think I can go get an oil change for 20 bucks if be- I didn't spend a cent on Hearthstone cards.
[471:03.28]Somebody did.
[471:10.04]Oil change.
[471:10.68]He's not changing his own oil.
[471:11.98]Yeah, I'm not lying on my... I don't... I'm moving on from this.
[471:19.15]I don't understand how I don't change my own oil.
[471:25.67]Is like the equivalent of me buying 50 packs of cigarettes every day.
[471:42.77]Same energy.
[471:43.47]That's what I'm saying.
[471:44.71]That's what I'm... See?
[471:45.95]You get it.
[471:46.99]You get it.
[471:47.96]You get it.
[471:48.46]That guy gets it.
[471:49.56]That guy gets it.
[471:50.34]Jackie, you get it.
[471:52.92]Jackie gets it.
[471:55.74]Do I drink the oil?
[471:56.96]No.
[471:57.38]I'm saying same energy, man.
[472:01.06]Alright.
[472:02.16]Let's keep going.
[472:02.86]I don't change my own fucking oil.
[472:05.08]Nobody does.
[472:08.13]I swear Twitch chat is like... They... Is...
[472:12.04]does everything.
[472:19.68]Dude, I will call every single contact in my phone and say, hey, when was the last time you changed your own oil?
[472:25.40]Uh, I don't.
[472:28.25]Okay, hang up.
[472:30.17]Call the next person.
[472:30.69]Hey, when was the last time you changed your own oil?
[472:33.77]I take it a jiffy loop.
[472:35.53]Oh, okay.
[472:41.73]I'm changing my oil right now.
[472:44.55]Yeah, I call somebody.
[472:45.63]Oh, hey, when's the last time you changed your own oil?
[472:48.16]I'm doing it right now.
[472:49.16]Why, do you not know how to do that?
[472:51.88]No, I don't.
[472:52.72]Ha!
[472:53.48]Serves you right, you fucking dick.
[472:59.78]Sorry, this is my second pack of cigarettes today.
[473:03.04]How many of you smoked?
[473:06.08]Same energy.
[473:06.74]I agree.
[473:08.26]Same energy.
[473:24.26]I'm so glad this is confusing a ton of people.
[473:28.97]Sick.
[473:29.81]Alright, let's keep going.
[473:31.69]He's insecure about this.
[473:50.53]What percent of Americans change their own oil?
[473:54.61]It's less than 20%.
[473:56.98]It's 18% of all the US car-owning population change their own fucking oil.
[474:13.21]The strong ones.
[474:14.31]We didn't talk about strong or weak.
[474:16.03]We talked about how many people actually do the thing you think that everybody does.
[474:23.47]No, I'm getting, I'm getting, I'm getting, I'm getting like gas lit.
[474:28.70]Alright, I'm feeding into it.
[474:29.80]I gotta stop.
[474:35.10]You are the 82%.
[474:35.78]Yeah, okay.
[474:38.44]Oh, no, they're doing it to me.
[474:40.22]They're trying, alright, let's go.
[474:41.62]We gotta move.
[474:42.42]We gotta move.
[474:43.00]I know what they're doing.
[474:44.80]I'm looking in the mirror right now.
[474:45.92]I know that's what they're doing.
[474:47.58]You don't let them get in there.
[474:54.23]Hey, Mesa!
[474:55.60]Mesa Raider.
[474:57.22]MMG.
[474:59.44]I had my 20th birthday the other day and I figured I'd ask if you had any tips on being old since you'd be the expert.
[475:05.46]Learn how to change your own oil.
[475:07.74]It'll save you... $20.
[475:11.12]Every, uh... Like, fucking five months.
[475:23.95]There you go.
[475:26.13]Suckomeus, thanks for the thousand bits.
[475:28.23]Order pizza on stream right now.
[475:29.75]No, no pizza.
[475:30.76]I need to be eaten healthy.
[475:32.46]Tingy, thanks for the 250.
[475:35.04]Hello, Jeremy.
[475:36.34]Berkey Gaming here to remind you to stay hydrated with some refreshing Berkey filtered water, the purest and best tasting way to hydrate.
[475:41.90]Thanks, Tingy.
[475:43.44]SadVega, thanks for the 250.
[475:44.78]You can choose any fictional hero or villain and you resort to dinky-brained comics.
[475:52.63]When we talked about who's the best superhero?
[475:59.58]Any fictional hero or villain in you dinky brain comics?
[476:06.40]What are the heroes and villains are there besides superheroes?
[476:14.26]Any fictional hero?
[476:20.12]Harry Potter?
[476:21.46]Mario?
[476:24.13]Is Mario a superhero?
[476:29.30]I mean, kind of, I guess.
[476:33.32]What does that make Luigi, then?
[476:37.88]Does Luigi have any superpowers?
[476:42.88]He's a loser.
[476:44.36]A sidekick.
[476:49.84]I mean, Luigi can jump high, too, though, can't he?
[476:58.30]Okay, um, if Mario got into a fight with Spider-Man, Spider-Man would beat the ever-living shit out of Mario.
[477:06.46]Like, if Iron Man and Super Mario got in a fight, Mario's dead in less than five seconds.
[477:12.53]Like, dead fucking instantly.
[477:19.19]Oh, so, like, Luigi can take on Thanos, apparently.
[477:25.44]The guy that walks into a ghost mansion and goes... And is scared of little kids ghosts.
[477:36.43]And has a vacuum cleaner.
[477:37.67]Can beat up Spider-Man.
[477:40.35]Am I actually hearing this?
[477:53.78]He's so mad.
[477:57.08]Like you aren't afraid of ghosts.
[477:59.36]Um, but... If you're a superhero... You don't... He's not a superhero.
[478:06.29]He's like a fun, cool, interesting guy that jumps high.
[478:11.99]And... Spider-Man would beat the shit out of him.
[478:18.32]Spider-Man would just have to like... And over his mouth.
[478:21.82]And he'd be like...
[478:26.07]And then Spider-Man would just do a roundhouse kick to his head and his head would explode.
[478:29.63]That's what happens.
[478:30.67]This is what would happen.
[478:36.34]He's like fucking four feet tall.
[478:47.38]Mario, they have too many lives.
[478:58.45]This is a playground argument.
[479:09.34]Luigi would use his... Spider-Man is... Yeah, I'm thinking about... Yeah, it's a playground argument.
[479:20.77]Fuck it, we're out of here.
[479:22.49]Hey, SatVega, thanks for the $2.50 again.
[479:26.95]They say, also, Happy New Year's.
[479:28.09]I didn't get a chance to say it at New Year's because I didn't want to keep you longer, and you were going to be late.
[479:33.01]Just know that the reason we donate so much to you is because we know you will do so much amazing things that we don't see anywhere else.
[479:39.89]I've actually had a couple of meetings over the last week.
[479:43.61]There's some crazy shit.
[479:48.55]There's some fucked up shit that's going to be happening that will rival the carnival that's happening this year.
[479:56.08]And it might even be bigger than the carnival in regards to scope.
[480:02.14]It's going to be fucking wild.
[480:04.41]I cannot wait until I get to really start to work on it.
[480:16.91]It is not carnival related.
[480:20.85]But it's in that same scope.
[480:25.53]And it's not even off the ground yet, but I know it will be.
[480:28.82]It's going to be a lot of fun.
[480:32.00]But yeah, happy New Year to you as well.
[480:33.34]Thank you.
[480:36.24]Yajacup, thanks for the thousand bits.
[480:38.20]Jerma, say I'm the Joker, baby.
[480:42.09]just did I don't know why you want me to do that but thank you though thank you Bob boy for the 1500 bits please play through Half-Life series in preparation for Half-Life: Alyx for Half-Life one play on easy no joke the game could be too hard I've played Half-Life before and the other difficulties I think I'll be alright I beat dusk on the hardest difficult I'll be alright thank you Bob boy though for the 1500.
[481:10.32]Also, we're getting to the end of a few days ago, and then we can move on to today.
[481:15.20]25, Dr. Pepper, thanks for the $2.50.
[481:16.66]Sure, Coke Gaming is cool, but what about Dr. Pepper Gaming?
[481:19.10]You'll be our next sponsor.
[481:20.72]Also, are you planning on playing Resident Evil 3?
[481:23.84]When the new one comes out, yeah.
[481:25.72]Absolutely.
[481:27.99]I don't think Dr. Pepper has anything to do with games or sponsors or anything.
[481:31.29]They just kind of do their own thing.
[481:36.51]just they do their own thing they don't really I don't think they're involved anywhere you know what I'm saying but anyways thank you to celestia logia or logia for the 500 bits I want to say thank you Jeremy I had the fortune to catch an upload of your New Year's Eve stream the other day and while you've made me laugh my face off plenty of times in recent years it was really your office authenticity that charmed me
[482:03.52]Well, you've been a joy to me in this chapter of my life.
[482:06.08]I'm even happier that you've been a joy to so many others.
[482:08.66]Thanks for being so mindful of other people's words.
[482:12.23]I never had a brother, but I'm happy to think of you as mine.
[482:15.75]Take care of yourself and goodbye.
[482:19.65]That's really sweet.
[482:28.18]It's the first time I've ever been called somebody's brother and not their grandfather.
[482:34.75]Or their weird, like, scary uncle.
[482:38.75]So thanks for that.
[482:45.08]Thanks.
[482:48.16]Really appreciate it.
[482:49.94]Hey Gnarly, thanks for the 250.
[482:50.86]Sorry about talking about Katana ZERO for like the 20th time, but I saw it on the poll in the pre-stream chat.
[482:55.70]I hope you end up playing it.
[482:56.96]It's good.
[482:58.44]That's the plan this week.
[482:59.55]I'm probably going to play it before next week.
[483:03.31]Apple Shift, thanks for 250.
[483:04.41]Hey, do you have a set date for the next community content night?
[483:06.63]No, I don't.
[483:08.09]But... Let's take a look at a calendar.
[483:10.79]Might as well do it now.
[483:15.29]So... 1, 2, 3...
[483:20.58]One, two, three.
[483:24.04]Ladies and gentlemen, the next community content night is going to be on Saturday the 18th.
[483:35.40]There you go.
[483:36.52]Because I did say I want to do it the first and second week.
[483:40.72]Somewhere into mid-January, so that makes sense.
[483:43.18]On the 18th, we'll do the next string of community content stuff.
[483:47.91]And then hopefully soon, I can get my shit taken care of.
[483:52.87]So I can not be a broken body piece of shit.
[483:58.05]And actually be able to get in front of the green screen and move around a lot.
[484:03.23]My old body... Actually, I went to the doctor.
[484:08.77]That was a specialist.
[484:12.13]And... We're probably gonna have to do a nerve-blocking injection.
[484:22.96]Is what I was told.
[484:25.52]Because he was under the assumption, he's like, I think you do have costochondritis and there's not really much anybody can do for it besides doing steroid injections.
[484:40.64]Apparently.
[484:44.08]Those of you that have no idea what's going on, what I'm talking about, I have a hiatal hernia, but every doctor I talked to said that they don't think that's really the reason why I'm in, like, pain all the time.
[484:56.53]They think it's because I have costochondritis, which is inflammation of your rib cage and the joints that connect to your chest and your back.
[485:03.73]You know, like, where your ribs connect to your spine and where your ribs, actually, your breastbone connects to your rib cage?
[485:10.65]Apparently, there's inflammation in there and there's not much that can really be done.
[485:14.41]so um if that is the complete and total diagnosis from two or three different doctors that you do injections you do steroid injections and sometimes you do like a nerve blocking steroid injection and it goes away forever we'll see how does it happen nobody knows uh hereditary
[485:36.10]It's just one of those things.
[485:37.24]It's just inflammation.
[485:37.98]I also have... You guys know, I mean, apparently it's an autoimmune bullshit, right?
[485:44.05]Because I have, and I've been diagnosed with in the past, colitis and inflammatory bowel disease shit.
[485:53.87]And that's also autoimmune, so... It's... Essentially, he said you probably have costochondritis because it's autoimmune and you already have autoimmune problems in the first place, so...
[486:07.09]There you go.
[486:08.89]For those of you that don't know what I'm talking about.
[486:11.13]And what it means is my range of motion is limited.
[486:16.36]Tilting hurts.
[486:17.66]Bending over hurts.
[486:19.14]Leaning backwards hurts.
[486:20.82]Remember when I fell down in the chair on New Year's Eve?
[486:22.78]I was okay.
[486:25.14]The next day, my chest was in a ton of pain.
[486:29.58]I actually was like... Like the next fucking day.
[486:36.32]The ultimate fall joke.
[486:38.91]That wasn't a joke.
[486:40.79]But we'll move on.
[486:41.93]We don't have to talk about it.
[486:43.67]I'm fine.
[486:44.39]I'm gonna be good to go.
[486:46.33]And I just have to do one more test and then maybe we'll be... sticking a needle in my rib cage.
[486:56.38]Sounds weird.
[486:57.08]Okay.
[486:58.00]But anyways, we'll go.
[487:00.22]Lokio.
[487:01.08]Lokio, thanks for the five dollars total.
[487:02.52]If you stop playing this game right now, I'll give you the rest of my bits.
[487:05.67]Thanks for honoring my bits.
[487:06.73]Here's the rest of them.
[487:09.05]I did do that, you're right.
[487:11.33]And that catches us up to now.
[487:15.05]Which we can go back.
[487:16.99]Let's go, go, go.
[487:18.23]Right here.
[487:18.65]Actually, this is not very much.
[487:21.19]We'll get through this pretty quickly.
[487:23.67]We had... What did we have?
[487:25.03]What did we have today?
[487:29.47]I was just turned on the cam, which would have been bad.
[487:33.09]Let's do this one.
[487:37.65]Let's go back to earlier this afternoon.
[487:40.08]We had 250 from Peaceful Haley.
[487:41.80]Jeremy, wanted to ask you, what do you do for fun off stream?
[487:46.00]What's a typical Jerma day?
[487:49.98]Pretty boring, actually.
[487:54.29]Grocery shopping.
[487:56.83]Do errands.
[487:58.07]I get stuff for the next streams.
[488:01.79]You know, most of the stuff that you see that just appears on streams randomly or things that I get or things that I do, it's usually set up a day or two before I stream.
[488:13.96]Go to the dinner.
[488:14.68]You know, Kim and I will spend time together.
[488:18.48]Go see a movie.
[488:22.14]Sometimes it's nice just to kind of chill and take a bath, you know?
[488:28.65]I, contrary to maybe some popular belief, I live a pretty boring private life.
[488:37.68]You know, I take my dog out, I eat, I hang out with my girlfriend.
[488:43.20]I don't really do much else besides preparing streams.
[488:53.03]And I sometimes, like, you know, I'll go out if, you know, if friends are in town or if we want to do something, we'll, oh, you know, today, we're going to go to the Strip today, right?
[489:01.73]We've done, I mean, Kim and I have gone out to the Strip where, you know, downtown Vegas a lot of times.
[489:08.46]But pretty basic, normal stuff.
[489:15.46]Oh, the Strip, not a Strip club.
[489:20.45]Another oil change servant.
[489:22.23]What?
[489:23.25]Well, here's something else that I need to say about that.
[489:43.93]is, sure, I'm the dude on the camera, and I'm the guy that says the lines, but some of the funniest shit that has come out of this community has come from people making the memes themselves.
[489:58.71]Some of the most interesting stuff comes from the community, and how you interpret the things that I say, or how you create something out of something that I do or say.
[490:10.59]So, it's not just me.
[490:16.39]You guys come up with a lot of funny shit, too, based on this community, so... We should be the streamer.
[490:24.80]Jerma, you're the muse, though.
[490:26.30]Hey, Potion Dweller, thanks for the $2.50.
[490:34.23]I know exactly how today is going to go.
[490:36.01]Okay, well, let's see.
[490:37.79]You will start out a very egotistical yet benevolent god, then you'll accidentally kill someone, and we'll all go D colon.
[490:46.00]Then someone will actually offend you, and you become a murderous psychopath petty god.
[490:54.03]Huh.
[490:58.75]I don't think it was that accurate.
[491:04.80]I didn't accidentally kill somebody.
[491:07.38]I intentionally killed a few people.
[491:09.38]I intentionally ate a few people.
[491:12.72]I ate that dead guy.
[491:13.66]Right?
[491:15.28]Like, that wasn't by accident.
[491:16.78]I... I ate the dead guy.
[491:18.98]Like, that was not by accident.
[491:23.06]It wasn't on... Remember when he threw the rock at the crowd?
[491:27.02]Oh, does anybody have that clip?
[491:30.53]Seriously.
[491:31.57]Does anybody have the clip of when he throws the rock into the crowd?
[491:34.95]It's like fucking hilarious.
[491:37.51]Where is it?
[491:39.55]Somebody has to have it.
[491:43.24]When the cow went psycho.
[491:48.42]It was so stupid.
[491:50.02]I was just trying to teach him how to, like, lift rocks.
[491:55.75]There it is.
[491:56.25]This is what I want.
[491:58.31]I need this in my life right now.
[492:03.09]No, not this.
[492:05.35]This is also funny.
[492:06.75]But not this one.
[492:09.65]Oh my god.
[492:12.65]not this here I still watch this still I guess this is funny too what are they doing over here are they praying what the is that
[492:32.97]What?
[492:33.99]Where's the other one?
[492:34.77]Where's the one?
[492:36.24]Here we go.
[492:37.46]Jerma's evil son.
[492:39.76]Jerma's evil son massacres innocents.
[492:42.66]Hey, you're supposed to be stuck in there.
[492:46.90]Hold on.
[492:47.33]I need to see.
[492:51.77]No, stop just throwing it.
[492:55.21]You just broke it.
[492:59.66]Where is it?
[493:04.12]He goes for the rock.
[493:05.32]Here it is right here.
[493:10.87]You don't give a fuck, man.
[493:13.75]Oh, he goes back and throws it at the building.
[493:18.34]He picks up another one.
[493:22.88]Right here.
[493:23.28]Look at all these people.
[493:25.56]Oh my god, what is he doing?
[493:31.05]Stop.
[493:32.59]Temper tantrum.
[493:36.19]Temper tantrum.
[493:37.57]Stop.
[493:37.83]Stop.
[493:38.55]Stop.
[493:39.01]Stop.
[493:39.45]Stop.
[493:39.99]Stop.
[493:41.64]He's killing everybody.
[493:43.06]That's not it.
[493:43.70]That's not it.
[493:44.34]Where does he throw the boulder?
[493:47.30]He throws the boulder.
[493:53.96]That's not even it.
[493:56.64]Where does he... He whips the boulder.
[493:58.86]And it hits like 15 people.
[494:02.52]Somebody's got it.
[494:06.50]It's right after that, yeah.
[494:09.88]Watch the full video.
[494:13.53]It's right there.
[494:14.17]No, wait.
[494:16.65]He cries and then he picks up the folder.
[494:20.77]Oh, I'll find it.
[494:22.23]We've lost control.
[494:23.23]Is that it?
[494:28.44]This is the funniest shit I've seen at least in 2020.
[494:40.27]Yeah, this is by far the funniest thing I've seen in 2020.
[494:43.54]It's only been eight days.
[494:44.38]I know, but still.
[494:45.54]It's going to be hard to top this for now.
[494:50.50]What's going on, internet?
[494:51.22]Let's go.
[494:51.56]It's buffering?
[494:52.22]What am I, buffering?
[494:53.06]Stop!
[495:01.73]Oh, stop!
[495:02.71]Stop!
[495:05.22]He's looking at his eyes!
[495:15.33]Why would he do that?
[495:18.15]He's crying!
[495:19.97]Stop!
[495:21.31]He's looking at his eyes!
[495:22.71]Don't do that!
[495:35.77]Oh, that was so funny.
[495:40.33]What an absolute psychopath.
[495:45.92]Anyways.
[495:50.48]Thank you to Potion Dweller.
[495:54.34]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[495:56.48]Really appreciate it.
[495:59.60]Also, we had a thousand bits from Suck Your Buss.
[496:06.45]And it was, watch this on stream or no balls.
[496:09.11]Is this Salty Swamp?
[496:10.23]This is a great series.
[496:11.15]What are you talking about?
[496:12.25]I mean, I'm not going to watch it.
[496:13.05]It's like a 10 minute video.
[496:16.08]That's Blordow's cartoon.
[496:20.38]It's old, but it's good.
[496:25.06]That's like 15, 16, that's like 16 years old.
[496:30.35]I think we've watched it on stream before.
[496:33.19]I'm certain we have.
[496:37.24]Dermalore.
[496:42.38]Watch this on stream.
[496:43.28]Not right now.
[496:44.66]No.
[496:45.70]Watch Joel's movie.
[496:46.88]We're going to watch Public Domain Movie Night.
[496:49.51]We'll watch a bunch of movies.
[496:50.89]Cue them up.
[496:57.61]I promise we will watch it.
[496:58.77]We're going to do a Public Domain Movie Night.
[497:03.63]But thank you, Sucky or Bus, for the 1,000 bits.
[497:05.89]Thanks for the 1,500 bits from Bulbaswag Desu.
[497:09.39]$15.
[497:11.23]Thanks a lot for that.
[497:12.27]I'm so happy.
[497:12.79]I recommended this game like a billion times.
[497:14.53]I used to play it all the time as a kid.
[497:17.63]Yeah, it's fantastic.
[497:19.63]We'll probably be playing it again tomorrow.
[497:23.03]At least for a little while.
[497:24.17]I feel like there's still a little bit more to see.
[497:27.85]We'll see.
[497:33.28]Uh, Trampston gave five community subs.
[497:34.90]I think I missed it, but thank you, Trampston.
[497:38.54]Phylactery Lich gave 5,000 bits.
[497:41.47]Again.
[497:41.91]Again.
[497:43.43]Another $50.
[497:45.57]Name your god Larry or we will riot.
[497:47.43]We'll get a proper name for the cow.
[497:49.87]Tomorrow.
[497:50.19]I'm going to have to really think about it.
[497:52.05]I was going to say something, but I didn't want to just jump on a random...
[497:56.72]name, and that's what the name is.
[497:58.22]No, no, no.
[497:58.68]I want to think about it.
[498:00.31]It's not going to be Mega Milk.
[498:01.79]Absolutely not.
[498:03.03]Sorry, guys.
[498:05.67]Bahima, thanks for the 250.
[498:06.63]I say it, repeat it.
[498:09.25]Repent for being late.
[498:12.23]I just said it.
[498:12.75]Whatever.
[498:13.43]And now I have to apologize for saying that.
[498:14.79]I'm sorry I just said that.
[498:15.73]Bulbaswag Desu, again, 1500 bits.
[498:18.01]Again.
[498:19.73]On top of your $1530 total here.
[498:20.91]Thank you, Bulbaswag.
[498:24.70]I wasn't able to get this game to work when I tried a few weeks ago, but this tutorial goes on forever.
[498:28.78]Yeah.
[498:32.12]It is a pain in the ass to get to run on anything over Windows 7.
[498:35.24]So those of you that want to play this game yourself, just be wary.
[498:41.26]It's an absolute mess to get it to run on new computers.
[498:50.00]Flindenburg, thanks for five community subs.
[498:54.68]Thank you, Flinzenberg.
[498:57.21]Jerma put some chips in F... Jerma put some chips in F tier, thanks for the 500 bits.
[499:03.61]I did.
[499:03.89]I just don't like them.
[499:06.11]I pray to... I pray this to you, God Jerma, so that you may show us your heavenly gigantic... feet.
[499:16.80]It's not what you guys thought it was going to be.
[499:18.08]Also, is there a chance that you'll play Outer Wilds in the future?
[499:20.46]Yes, it's on the table.
[499:23.77]I have a list over here with 50 plus games at this point that are all going to get played.
[499:29.50]It's all early 2020 plans.
[499:31.92]So yes, I will be playing Outer Wilds, I promise.
[499:38.40]I hope so.
[499:38.70]All I can say back to you guys is, as the channel grows, I'm gonna try to do more and more things that I've wanted to try.
[500:06.61]we cross 10,000 fucking subs, I'm gonna do some shit that I may never have ever been able to do and may never be able to do ever again.
[500:15.32]You know what I'm saying?
[500:15.94]Like, I'm... I want to try new things.
[500:19.66]I promise I'll do even less.
[500:21.46]Imagine if I said that.
[500:29.86]So, yeah.
[500:32.27]I'm gonna... I'm gonna keep rolling.
[500:34.47]We'll see what happens, alright?
[500:38.62]But thank you, Topec.
[500:39.88]And yes, you can expect the streams to start pulled back where I was a couple months ago.
[500:45.66]Around 1 to 2 p.m.
[500:47.42]Pacific time.
[500:50.43]Indefinitely for the foreseeable future.
[500:53.57]How did Black and White go?
[500:54.65]It was very fun.
[500:55.65]It was a ton of fun.
[500:59.43]I told you it was gonna be a hit.
[501:03.40]Do you remember the first, like, 20 minutes of the stream?
[501:09.40]I'm just saying.
[501:17.72]There was a lot of ResidentSleeper, next game, resident fuck, and I told you, you're ResidentSleeper in Half-Life 1 right now.
[501:25.24]And I looked over and there was at least 100 people that were like, good, I would do that for Half-Life 1 as well.
[501:28.91]And I'm like, fuck.
[501:30.95]Oh, how do I please this person?
[501:37.97]It really starts to pop off when you get the creatures.
[501:40.17]Yeah.
[501:49.02]But... Thank you, Pubble, for the 500 bits!
[501:50.74]Chat is pretty cool.
[501:52.66]Yeah, I agree.
[502:08.52]You know, sometimes they can ResidentSleeper, one of the best PC games ever.
[502:14.52]You know, you let it slide.
[502:21.85]Alright, I may have flown off the handle there.
[502:26.45]This probably isn't the top 10 best PC game ever made.
[502:30.92]The series is up there with some of people's most beloved cult classic video games ever made.
[502:35.20]I probably should have said that.
[502:40.64]I mean, it might be... It paved the way for a lot of... Because Lionhead made this game and then everybody was like, oh, wow, having choices and having powers and having AI control themselves and do weird things and people took it and, you know, it was... It's pretty classic.
[503:04.38]Hey, Bulbaswag, thanks for the 1,500 more bits on top of the already 30 you gave.
[503:10.63]Thank you, Bulbaswag.
[503:11.35]They said, get the cow.
[503:12.21]I did.
[503:13.97]Classic doesn't mean good, but in this case, it does.
[503:18.85]We also have to remember, this is almost, this is like 20 years old.
[503:22.28]This is like a 15, 16-year-old game, something like that.
[503:24.92]Can you imagine what this was like, playing this, when you could be good or evil, and it was one of the first times you could ever do that?
[503:34.67]You still got the original box?
[503:36.46]I got the original box, too.
[503:37.70]It's pretty awesome.
[503:40.48]Came out in 2001.
[503:42.06]Right.
[503:43.48]See?
[503:46.90]Show the box?
[503:47.54]I don't have any clothes on.
[503:48.28]I can't.
[503:48.58]I'll show it tomorrow.
[503:52.75]The second one wasn't as good, but it was fun.
[503:55.61]Yeah, I feel like we won't be spending as much time in Black and White 2.
[503:58.47]Maybe.
[504:00.69]Maybe.
[504:03.26]Like I said, I'm willing to give these games a good full two streams.
[504:05.96]I feel like we just opened up everything, so... But yeah, thank you, Pubble.
[504:15.41]Thank you for the 18 months in a row of your subscriptions.
[504:17.57]Thank you, Bulbaswag, for the $1,500.
[504:19.99]We did get the cow.
[504:20.89]Tar Alecrin, thanks for the $250.
[504:23.95]The other day in chat, people were telling you that bananas were radioactive.
[504:27.35]I went along with the bit because I thought it was funny.
[504:30.09]But I was watching a science video the other day, and it turns out that not only are they radioactive, but they reliably produce antimatter, the most dangerous and volatile substance in the universe.
[504:40.56]On average, a single banana will produce a particle of antimatter every 70 minutes.
[504:45.74]This is horse shit.
[504:49.41]You made the whole thing up.
[504:54.80]Thanks for the $2.50, though.
[504:55.88]Appreciate it.
[505:05.30]Look it up.
[505:07.19]Do I actually have to write this?
[505:09.75]Bananas antimatter.
[505:14.65]This is real.
[505:18.63]The average banana rich in potassium produces positron roughly once every 75 minutes.
[505:30.71]This feels like a fake website.
[505:37.45]Okay, the top two sources for this are the same website.
[505:47.17]Antimatter particle and bananas.
[505:48.67]Hold on.
[505:54.57]Maybe it is quantum...
[505:58.91]Today I learned... Oh, here's Reddit.
[506:00.59]Today I learned bananas produce antimatter.
[506:02.59]Let's see if somebody in the first comment goes, Actually, you're fucking stupid.
[506:06.80]Let's see.
[506:12.44]Between this and the radiation thing, I'm becoming increasingly distrustful of bananas, and I really don't need that in my life.
[506:24.30]This and the radiation thing are the same thing.
[506:27.90]Wow, what a terrible sentence.
[506:29.66]Bananas contain potassium.
[506:31.18]A small percentage of all naturally occurring potassium is in the form of potassium-40.
[506:36.60]Potassium-40 decays through all three kinds of beta decay.
[506:40.84]Most of it is electron emission, some of it's electron capture, and a tiny percentage is positron emission.
[506:47.19]It's a very small, arguably negligible amount of radiation.
[506:51.97]The banana equivalent dose
[506:54.82]is 0.1 weird USV.
[506:59.07]In contrast, you actually receive 10 USV background radiation per day on average, 100 times more than eating a fucking banana.
[507:08.62]I said that to you guys.
[507:09.64]It's three weeks ago.
[507:16.28]This is also you need potassium to live.
[507:25.14]So, um, you should be able to add, this is a great quote from this fucking scientist, this Reddit scientist.
[507:33.11]Uh, you should actually keep your banana intake below 2,740 bananas a day.
[507:40.58]Um, to get below that radiation limit that you get just from it, just existing a day.
[507:47.58]Okay, so be careful, guys.
[507:53.44]Make sure you don't eat 3,000 bananas a day.
[507:56.18]To get the same radiation that you get by existing, just standing in your room for a day.
[508:00.84]Like I said, go in your basement and breathe in once.
[508:04.02]You just ate fucking 5,000 bananas.
[508:05.68]Thank you.
[508:06.16]I'm so glad that we looked that up.
[508:08.12]So glad we got over that.
[508:11.42]Where are we here?
[508:12.00]Okay.
[508:18.94]Parasol.
[508:19.58]Thank you, Parasol, for the 1,000 bits.
[508:22.78]Hey Jermo, just wanted to drop in and say I truly appreciate you.
[508:25.78]It's my dream to see you play my own game someday.
[508:29.36]Until then, love you.
[508:32.98]Until then though, but what game?
[508:36.15]What game?
[508:36.87]Hmm.
[508:40.83]Never trust a Redditor.
[508:41.97]Why not?
[508:46.23]It's a porn game.
[508:47.21]You'll see.
[508:47.75]Thank you Parasol for the thousand bits.
[508:51.15]I don't think it's a porn game.
[508:53.09]Kaimera, thanks for the 300 bits.
[508:54.47]Hey, Jerem, I'm pretty late, but just want to say thanks for the kind words on my Zaraxos poster on the content night.
[508:59.68]Really made all the work I put into it worth it.
[509:01.56]Can't wait for the next one.
[509:03.00]It was awesome, so thank you.
[509:05.56]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[509:07.97]But he said, why not?
[509:10.63]No, I can't play a porn game on stream.
[509:13.35]I'm not going to play a porn game anyways.
[509:15.43]Why would I play a porn game?
[509:20.08]Thank you non-a-ha-a-r for the 250.
[509:25.26]Glad I can once again donate to the best streamer on Twitch.
[509:27.18]I was so happy watching the award stream.
[509:28.72]You deserve every cent.
[509:30.35]Since you took me up on my black and white game recommendation, it was recommended a lot.
[509:34.39]So yeah, I told you guys.
[509:35.55]How long till you give it and play Dragon Rampa?
[509:37.55]Probably never.
[509:39.55]Like, black and white is my jam.
[509:42.84]You know what I mean?
[509:44.12]I don't think I'll play one of those.
[509:45.66]I don't think I'm going to play Dragon Rampa.
[509:49.78]Probably never.
[509:50.34]I'm just gonna be real.
[509:52.74]Stuff like... People say, play Dragonronpa.
[509:55.06]Play Doki Doki Literature Club.
[509:56.42]Play this game.
[509:58.16]Play this... I'm really not into them.
[510:00.16]I really don't want to play them.
[510:03.52]What's it called?
[510:04.84]What's it called?
[510:06.87]Drag... What's it called?
[510:11.89]Dangan... Danganronpa.
[510:16.86]What am I saying?
[510:17.36]Dragonrompa?
[510:19.24]I like it better.
[510:20.54]I say it better that way.
[510:21.56]Danganrompa.
[510:25.92]Probably not, though.
[510:26.78]It doesn't look like it's up my alley.
[510:36.77]Hey, InvaderZ, thanks for the $2.50.
[510:38.95]Hey, Jerem, I was wondering when the next Community Content Night is.
[510:43.97]Uh, 18th?
[510:48.49]Also, here's a picture of my rats.
[510:52.39]Updated picture.
[510:52.95]You now have four rats.
[510:59.00]It's not good.
[510:59.76]It's actually okay.
[511:02.80]What, the game?
[511:07.00]Why you got them in this bowl?
[511:10.71]You got, like, rats in, like, a bowl.
[511:12.69]Here, look.
[511:19.85]That's a bowl with four in there?
[511:21.63]I know rats actually like to stuff into each other though, don't they?
[511:35.38]Don't rats notoriously like to just get all on top of each other and like stuff onto each other and stuff?
[511:42.17]That's a rat bowl.
[511:53.18]Jerma can't say snuggle.
[511:55.98]Oh, that's true.
[511:56.54]That is what that is.
[511:57.66]Don't say it like that.
[511:58.90]I'm very literal.
[512:09.68]Yes, cuddling.
[512:11.02]Sure.
[512:11.26]When I say stuff into each other, I mean pushing into each other.
[512:16.78]Hey, Kim.
[512:17.18]I'm not going to read that.
[512:19.87]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[512:22.65]But I'm talking in terms of, like, they press into each other and they roll and press and roll around and... Alright, I'm done.
[512:32.50]I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, moving on.
[512:36.55]I gotta get rats.
[512:37.93]I want, like, a lizard, too.
[512:39.03]I want a huge monitor dragon.
[512:40.47]I want a, like, a tegu.
[512:43.16]So bad.
[512:43.56]I want a huge fucking lizard.
[512:45.68]But, like, I can't.
[512:46.58]It's just not... It's too much.
[512:48.16]Hey, Fryzen.
[512:49.58]Uh... Frenzen?
[512:53.00]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[512:59.27]Thank you for all the laughs over the years, Jerma.
[513:00.81]This is all I can give for now.
[513:05.18]One cent.
[513:07.22]Well, you can't even give one cent.
[513:09.44]25 cents.
[513:11.21]Or 25,000 bits.
[513:13.13]If you give money to this channel, don't ever think that this is all I can give you for now.
[513:18.49]Don't feel obligated to give me money.
[513:21.91]Thank you for ever even considering it.
[513:27.54]Thank you for the thousand bits.
[513:34.56]Getting to the end here.
[513:35.82]Let's get the credits on, by the way.
[513:38.70]Roll them up there.
[513:41.16]Here they come.
[513:41.84]Thanks all the subs, everybody.
[513:44.08]There are a lot of you now.
[513:45.10]You know the number.
[513:47.66]You know the number of how many people have subbed to this channel.
[513:51.74]It's an insane amount of people.
[513:54.53]It's more than I ever thought that this channel would ever have.
[513:58.63]Ever.
[513:59.97]So... Thank you, all of you.
[514:06.55]Regardless if I know it's a lot of gifted and community subs from New Year's and if regardless if you stick around or not This number here is fucking over 10,000 subs is fucking ridiculous.
[514:20.79]It's absolutely insane Hope I use your money.
[514:26.67]Well, I plan to I
[514:30.85]Next goal, 20,000 subs.
[514:33.52]I don't know about that.
[514:35.06]That's, uh... That's... At some point, I... At some point, you make a movie.
[514:47.48]You know what I mean?
[514:48.12]Like, that's an absolute dick... That's an absolute shitload of money.
[514:52.08]You know, at some point, you hire Danny DeVito to fucking, like, come on stream and, like, throw an egg at me.
[515:05.48]You said dick.
[515:06.74]I was... It's just... You know what I mean.
[515:10.96]But regardless of where that number goes, up or down, seriously, it's... We crossed a threshold here that... It seems impossible to cross.
[515:21.58]Thanks again, guys.
[515:24.35]There's still a few more bits to do.
[515:25.45]We have Mozziconi.
[515:29.55]Mozziconi for the... Mozziconi for $1,000.
[515:32.81]There's a lot of $10 drops tonight.
[515:34.89]A lot of $1,000, $1,500, $1,500.
[515:36.01]Thank you.
[515:37.83]Seriously, it's a lot of money.
[515:41.33]Hey, Jerma, I got some bad news about my cat today.
[515:43.91]But your stream has been making it easier to cope.
[515:45.67]Just wanted to thank you for making everything a little easier.
[515:49.29]Whatever that news is, I hope you get through it.
[515:56.03]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[515:57.11]Thanks for sticking around.
[515:59.15]It's my pleasure to have you around.
[516:08.88]Sorry about the bad news.
[516:12.58]Whatever it is.
[516:16.59]Moving on to For Real Dough for $2.50.
[516:18.75]Is there a specific guide you use to get this game working?
[516:22.47]If yes, can we get a link to it?
[516:25.80]Okay, let me go through the process here.
[516:27.96]Because it was weird.
[516:30.10]So... There is... This is an original CD.
[516:35.60]So it's black and white.
[516:36.94]Just the game.
[516:38.44]The original game.
[516:39.26]No expansions or anything.
[516:41.36]And I installed it.
[516:43.46]I did not run it with compatibility mode.
[516:46.27]I just installed the game.
[516:50.07]Yeah, go to PC Gaming Wiki.
[516:51.29]That's a great place to do it.
[516:52.27]There is a fan patch...
[516:54.97]Because the game patched up to version 1.3, I think is where the game officially ended.
[517:01.26]And then some fans made a 1.4, and it fixed a bunch of the bugs and made it, I think, run better or run on newer hardware.
[517:10.74]Because I tried to run this game without the fan patch, and it didn't work.
[517:13.70]It crashed the desktop every single time.
[517:17.44]Yeah, BWF files, Windows 10, yeah.
[517:24.26]I think there's at least a couple of guides on that website too.
[517:26.84]But you have to have that, especially if you have Windows 10, you have to have that 1.43 or 1.42, whatever it is, fan patch.
[517:37.34]And we've had it crash maybe once or twice and had a little scare about the save game, but for the most part it's been running, I would say, flawlessly at this point.
[517:48.87]You also might have to get a DLL too.
[517:53.89]But cross that bridge when you need to.
[517:58.79]But that fan patch will help you.
[518:03.26]It's the only way to install black and white legit.
[518:08.56]Big crashes.
[518:17.28]You know, okay, this is like this is funny to me, but also like I can't believe it We're still arguing about oil changes right now But I mean the others but I like Somebody's saying it's a mess.
[518:34.88]It's a pain.
[518:35.60]I I'd rather just have somebody else do it about my time is valuable to me.
[518:40.40]You know what I mean?
[518:41.20]Like I We're still going on that
[518:46.93]Does Luigi change his own oil?
[518:51.61]Luigi probably can't even change his own diaper, guys.
[519:01.74]Why am I so mean to Luigi?
[519:04.04]Why would I be this mean to Luigi?
[519:08.73]jenski flower thanks for 300 bits hey Jerma I'm really glad you're playing black and white it's one of my favorite childhood games and when I bring it up everyone thinks I'm talking about Pokémon black and white hope your doctor's appointment went well and you're feeling better from your illness or at least doing better than I am since I'm having an allergic reaction to my hair dye and have sore itchy scabs all over my scalp holy that's doesn't sound fun
[519:35.91]And if you're not, you better get some rest, you toasted walnut.
[519:41.03]Yeah, I'm feeling alright.
[519:43.23]I was coming down from my actual... I had a head cold over the last few days, and I'm feeling okay now.
[519:48.53]I'll probably be 100% better tomorrow.
[519:52.64]We can keep going.
[519:54.74]But thank you, JenskyFlower, for the 300 bits.
[519:58.98]MiniClips, thanks for the 500 bits.
[520:00.62]What do you call a cow with no legs?
[520:02.16]A ground beef.
[520:07.12]Thank you, Bulbaswag, again, for five more dollars here.
[520:10.29]Just wanted to round up my bits for the night.
[520:12.77]But I gotta say, you're a cruel and vengeful god.
[520:21.21]Uh, is it me that's cruel?
[520:23.52]I keep think- Okay.
[520:27.28]Fuck, what did I think of this morning?
[520:30.69]I was in bed this morning and I started laughing, just laughing really hard at something.
[520:39.28]What was it?
[520:40.96]It was something random that I thought you guys would think was funny.
[520:45.38]I was in bed rolling around.
[520:46.66]You know when you get lost in your thoughts and you're in that half sleep?
[520:52.36]And you're not dreaming, but your imagination becomes way vivid.
[520:57.57]Way more interesting and way more vivid when you're in that halfway point.
[521:02.67]Something stream-related happened that I remembered, and I just started cracking up.
[521:10.39]What the hell was it?
[521:11.17]This is gonna happen, though.
[521:12.83]I'm gonna randomly see in that half-sleep the cow throwing the rocket, though, those people, and I'm gonna start cracking up.
[521:20.25]It's inevitable.
[521:25.76]That's so, ugh, I'm so... I love this cow, and if it wasn't the cow, if it was gonna be the ape, the ape probably wouldn't have done that.
[521:33.94]I don't think so.
[521:34.52]The cow, like, sucks.
[521:36.02]So, I don't think the ape would have done it.
[521:38.58]I love this cow.
[521:39.90]We gotta rescue him.
[521:40.86]Don't you understand?
[521:41.44]We have to rescue him.
[521:43.39]He's being captured and tortured right now.
[521:45.77]We have to get him.
[521:49.67]But, thank you, Bulbaswag.
[521:52.17]Tangent, thanks for the five community subs, Tangent.
[521:55.18]The PC int thanks for 300 bits.
[521:57.54]Jerma, it's not your fault, but my username is the point, but the O is a C. LOL, the point was taken.
[522:08.02]Oh, so it's not the PC int.
[522:11.26]It's the point.
[522:11.96]Uh, hope you have a good day.
[522:14.90]Missed most of the stream.
[522:15.78]Seems like it was both chaotic and boring at the same time.
[522:22.17]Um...
[522:27.12]No, I mean, it's just a different type of game, you know?
[522:29.70]They take a while to do anything interesting.
[522:31.74]But when stuff happens, it goes fucking crazy.
[522:39.86]That's another reason why I wanted to do the tutorial and, like, try to pay attention to a lot of things.
[522:44.60]Because to make anything fun happen in the game, you really kind of need to know how it works.
[522:50.52]And I didn't want to just blow through it.
[522:51.92]Because I could skip the tutorial completely.
[522:58.80]So, I need to continue to learn.
[523:01.68]Level 3 requires you to use all the mechanics Jerm has been neglecting.
[523:04.18]It should be good.
[523:06.11]We'll see.
[523:08.75]But thanks, though.
[523:10.83]Errorless thanks for the 250.
[523:11.59]When are you going to do a collab with Lil Nas?
[523:17.47]I don't think that's going to happen.
[523:21.41]I mean, I'm flattered.
[523:23.13]I'm flattered if he likes the rat movie.
[523:28.43]If that's where they got it from.
[523:30.91]You know what I mean?
[523:34.65]That's flattering.
[523:39.19]Just DM him and say you're the giant rat guy.
[523:41.57]I don't know if I want to do that.
[523:44.93]Hey!
[523:45.59]Hey!
[523:45.97]I'm the giant rat guy!
[523:47.29]Hey, you tweeted that?
[523:48.61]I'm the giant rat guy!
[523:49.35]It's me!
[523:50.67]You tweeted something out with the giant rat guy!
[523:52.18]I'm that guy!
[523:53.90]That's a little... That's that kind of grasping.
[523:55.64]I don't know.
[523:56.08]I'm not into that.
[523:57.42]Mm-mm.
[523:59.62]That's just cool that he may have seen the video.
[524:03.19]That's just cool.
[524:03.81]I don't need... I don't need anything else.
[524:06.85]You know, that's enough for me.
[524:09.49]But, you know, if he did...
[524:12.20]If he was like, hey, giant rat was really awesome.
[524:16.12]I'd be like, that's me, I'm that guy.
[524:20.26]No, I'm kidding around.
[524:22.54]That's just cool.
[524:25.04]And that's all there is to it.
[524:29.10]Hightide, thanks for the 1500 bits.
[524:30.86]$15, thanks a lot.
[524:33.92]This is my way of saying thank you.
[524:35.00]I've been watching your videos for over five years.
[524:37.48]Specifically starting with the pincushion experiment.
[524:40.38]That was a good one.
[524:42.68]You continue to be the funniest entertainer out there and I can never make up the countless hours of entertainment you've provided.
[524:49.49]Thanks.
[524:52.25]Man, I wish I'd been watching you for five years.
[524:56.68]Well, you got five years from now.
[525:00.07]Five years from now, you'll look back and be like, oh, remember that?
[525:02.13]It was pretty fucking cool.
[525:04.01]Remember when Kyle threw the rock at those people?
[525:11.18]Your story begins now.
[525:16.38]But seriously, high tide.
[525:17.34]Thank you.
[525:19.01]Thanks for allowing me to be able to do something like this.
[525:22.23]And wake up every day and go, what do I want to try to do today that might be fun?
[525:29.39]People like you allow me to do that.
[525:30.67]So, thank you.
[525:33.28]Finally, we have a couple more.
[525:34.24]We have Kerbumble for 300 bits.
[525:36.82]We have Forealdo for 250.
[525:38.20]I enjoyed the stream.
[525:39.60]I'm hoping this game and the sequel get a digital release, re-release, or a decent spiritual successor.
[525:45.56]That's something that I wish they already existed.
[525:49.43]If you took black and white, one and two, and just remade it as just... Just remake it, just black and white.
[525:57.21]Remake some of the systems, take away some of the potentially more grindy, frustrating systems that are in the game, and put a bunch of new creatures in, make the AI crazier.
[526:06.40]People would eat this up so much, but not very many people... Not many people know it exists.
[526:12.19]And the people that do know it exists can barely play it because it's hard to get to run.
[526:20.66]It's Microsoft.
[526:21.60]Microsoft is sitting on all this shit.
[526:23.86]Microsoft owns all these assets.
[526:25.96]Get on it!
[526:32.86]Microsoft owns all the Lionhead IP, right?
[526:40.26]There's so much interesting shit that they could do with some of these Lionhead IPS.
[526:50.09]EA owns it?
[526:51.79]I thought Lionhead was absorbed by Microsoft.
[526:56.75]No, I thought so.
[526:57.65]It's EA, what?
[527:06.35]Seriously?
[527:14.26]That's even worse.
[527:15.10]Yeah, that is kind of worse.
[527:20.54]I always thought that it came with the absorption of all of Lionhead.
[527:26.14]Hmm.
[527:28.02]Well, oh well.
[527:29.89]Send it to bed, then.
[527:30.61]Because that ain't coming back.
[527:34.23]E-Cookie, thanks for the $2.50 and our final bit of the night.
[527:36.73]Hey, Jerma, I'm a veterinarian by trade and specialize in small rodents like rats, mice, and hamsters.
[527:43.22]Alright, let's get some info here.
[527:44.36]For rats, they do actually enjoy being put in small piles with other rats.
[527:48.00]Like, yeah, right?
[527:50.80]If I have a particularly anxious rat, I will place him with four or five other rats in a bowl.
[527:56.77]Then put that into a deep fryer.
[527:59.37]You motherfucker.
[528:01.63]Right, okay.
[528:02.95]Thanks, veterinarian.
[528:05.65]Thanks, the fucking fake veterinarian.
[528:13.99]That's the last bit of the night.
[528:18.43]I'll see you guys tomorrow for more black and white, potentially.
[528:21.95]We might do a split stream tomorrow.
[528:24.81]We might play black and white for a couple hours and then move on to Lake Katana ZERO.
[528:28.81]Or maybe we get addicted and I just stay on it like I did today for like eight hours.
[528:33.27]See you guys soon.
[528:34.93]Have a great rest of your night.
[528:38.81]And I will see you very soon.
[528:43.07]Very soon.
[528:44.05]Very, very, very, very, very soon.
[528:49.71]Very soon.
[528:52.07]Say sorry.
[528:52.97]Wait, wait, wait.
[528:53.64]E-Cookie just gave... E-Cookie gave 250 more bits.
[528:58.96]They say sorry.
[529:01.66]E-Cookie.
[529:05.46]Apology.
[529:06.08]How dare you.
[529:12.93]Uh, yeah, let's raid somebody.
[529:16.09]He's streaming right now.
[529:18.23]I've been trying to follow more people in ship and try to keep up with... Because we've gotten some really, really great communities.
[529:24.84]We've had some raids.
[529:27.52]BoxBox has raided the channel like three times with thousands of people.
[529:32.52]We got that raid from Ludwig with three or four thousand people a couple weeks ago.
[529:37.35]I really want to try to catch some of these people when they're streaming.
[529:49.56]Raid Kiwo.
[529:50.24]Kiwo, yeah, that's where Kiwo is streaming right now.
[529:51.88]Okay, what are you doing?
[529:53.22]What are you doing, Kiwo?
[529:59.83]What are you up to?
[530:01.91]It's been a while.
[530:04.55]Yeah, let's raid Kiwo.
[530:08.91]Uh, she's doing no pixel.
[530:12.49]Grand Theft Auto.
[530:13.07]I, I, Jerma, do no pixel.
[530:16.21]Do no pixel.
[530:19.54]I... I maybe one day.
[530:22.49]Maybe one day.
[530:23.29]I don't know.
[530:25.01]Go say hello to keyboard guys.
[530:28.98]And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[530:31.74]Take care.
[530:33.06]See you soon.
[530:34.57]Good night.
[530:49.20]That video is in a different spot as well.
[530:51.57]That video is in a different spot as well.
[530:53.05]I swear to God.
[530:54.63]All my videos have moved.
[530:58.07]Here comes the end of the stream.
[531:00.02]I don't know what this video is.
[531:00.98]It's not in this folder.
[531:03.20]See you tomorrow.
[531:04.16]Good night.
[531:04.64]Goodbye.
[531:05.56]We don't need it now.
[531:06.12]No outro.
[531:06.50]Good night.
