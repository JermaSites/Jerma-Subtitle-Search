[00:04.47]Okay, I'm back.
[00:06.51]If you need something to split somebody's skull or a helm to protect your own, we have everything you need right here.
[00:16.49]I'm back.
[00:18.97]And I am ready to invite you.
[00:21.59]Are you ready for an invitation?
[00:24.14]Yeah.
[00:25.34]Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance.
[00:29.33]Who is the alliance with?
[00:30.55]What's the lore here?
[00:31.67]You'll see.
[00:34.54]Alright, so this game is one of my favorites growing up.
[00:39.31]Hey, we did Tony Hawk.
[00:40.17]Now we're doing Dark Alliance.
[00:41.23]You never played this one, did you?
[00:42.53]You didn't play any of these, did you?
[00:43.71]I don't know anything about this game.
[00:46.44]Ah, okay.
[00:47.30]Let me invite you.
[00:50.00]I'm going to live react.
[00:52.53]You should.
[00:58.70]And here you go.
[01:04.80]And I have to make sure you are one of the other controllers.
[01:10.92]Oh, somebody's in here.
[01:12.53]I think you're good.
[01:20.14]Okay.
[01:21.14]Are you in?
[01:21.88]Whoa.
[01:22.64]This game's crazy.
[01:24.68]Is he in?
[01:24.94]The graphics on those trees?
[01:27.67]Yeah, I'm in.
[01:30.11]Cool.
[01:30.23]Alright.
[01:32.71]Can you guys hear it?
[01:33.73]Yes, you can.
[01:36.32]I'll turn it up a little bit for you guys.
[01:40.41]Alright, new game.
[01:42.35]This is a top-down ARPG.
[01:45.75]There's loot.
[01:46.83]It's hard.
[01:47.43]We have to actually be careful.
[01:49.02]We need to work together, so I don't want to hear any bullshit.
[01:51.14]Don't, like, try to get more points than me.
[01:53.30]Is what I'm saying.
[01:55.12]Okay, we're gonna have the same amount of points on normal.
[01:59.19]Normal?
[01:59.63]We're normal gamers?
[02:00.55]Definitely play normal.
[02:02.73]This game came out in 2001.
[02:05.19]I don't know what any of them do.
[02:09.48]I'll be the sorceress.
[02:10.81]There's an archer, a fighter, and a sorceress.
[02:13.71]I think they can all equip everything.
[02:16.45]And by the way, we're going into the chill zone now.
[02:19.11]So if you want to just relax and watch a couple of goobers play Dark Alliance, that's what we're going to do.
[02:30.02]I've had the itch to play this game for like a year or two.
[02:32.75]And here we are.
[02:36.41]A year or two?
[02:38.63]Yeah, I've wanted to play this for a while.
[02:39.94]Didn't you just ask me to play like...
[02:42.82]You said, I was just thinking this, like, a day ago.
[02:45.51]Did you pick?
[02:46.37]I just think this.
[02:47.87]I just think this, like, once every, like, few months.
[02:53.02]So.
[02:54.48]Hey, turn the base of your mic down.
[02:57.20]Is it not?
[02:59.77]Can you not pick?
[03:00.39]No.
[03:01.41]Yeah, my controller isn't working.
[03:02.73]Hold on.
[03:03.39]Let me see if I can fix it.
[03:04.88]Or you could pick for me, and then maybe in the game I'm good.
[03:08.06]I can't pick.
[03:09.68]Hold on.
[03:13.91]It says you are two.
[03:18.01]Let me move you off of two and then put you back maybe.
[03:22.08]It says you're two.
[03:25.12]OK, you should be in here.
[03:27.39]Could you do it?
[03:27.89]Did you do it before?
[03:29.07]Could you marry?
[03:30.91]Does it work now?
[03:33.68]You have to get out of the menu for me to try.
[03:36.80]Yes, hey there we go OK.
[03:40.86]Don't skip.
[03:41.90]No, you shouldn't.
[03:42.72]It's loud as hell.
[03:46.57]One.
[03:46.77]You are weary from your travels, but mesmerized at the sight of Baldur's Gate.
[03:57.84]Not only a town of myth and legend, but also a place where one can find fame and fortune round every corner.
[04:06.96]It's a good cutscene.
[04:09.29]I like his walk.
[04:12.87]Is my mic too bass boosted?
[04:14.86]Is that person just lying?
[04:18.98]You sound the same as always.
[04:20.01]No, no!
[04:22.15]I got hit.
[04:30.18]I always thought he was really... I always wanted to get him when I was younger.
[04:44.38]I wanted to kill him.
[04:45.73]He's your brother, Kane!
[04:50.49]I could do it right now, but I don't want to.
[04:56.22]Okay, yeah, it's the chill zone.
[04:57.38]Open up the freezer, put one foot in, grab a popsicle, and sit down.
[05:01.11]You're frozen.
[05:03.15]Oh, yeah.
[05:04.89]I'm probably going to make my mic screw up.
[05:06.22]Dude, that guard's in a ska band.
[05:10.58]You guys just entered the chill zone.
[05:17.05]They're becoming more bold with each passing day.
[05:24.93]You'd best stay off the streets after the sun sets.
[05:28.67]It's not safe out here.
[05:30.97]You can seek shelter in the Elfsong Tavern.
[05:33.44]It's close enough.
[05:34.96]It's right there.
[05:36.26]Aye, more than enough cutthroats there.
[05:40.35]I think they put this play on for everyone just to sell them like a night in the tavern.
[05:45.82]Oh, there you are.
[05:47.62]You come to the Elfsong Tavern.
[05:51.81]it is a small place filled with a motley assortment of patrons and grizzly trophies there the haunting voice is all around you and the patrons are silent as the song washes over is there any gameplay one by one dude it's the opening cut where you've settled down that person's like I've already watched four tick tocks worth of game length whereas
[06:21.39]Oh, no.
[06:22.89]What happened?
[06:24.33]Are you good?
[06:28.20]It is beautiful, but where's the voice coming from?
[06:30.98]Why does she sing?
[06:39.28]No one truly knows.
[06:41.12]Her spirit was here when I first bought this tavern.
[06:43.74]Bro, where's the battle pass?
[06:46.09]There's no battle pass in this game.
[06:47.37]The battle pass is called battling your friends because you're going to get mad at each other because you're going to die.
[06:51.41]I'm going to die to a trap and he's going to get mad.
[06:53.28]Are you really talking over this lore?
[06:57.10]Fine.
[06:58.18]I'm looking at the lore.
[07:01.33]Oh, is there no subtitles?
[07:02.41]Can I turn on?
[07:02.93]I thought subtitles were on.
[07:04.45]Alright, quiet so people can hear.
[07:07.85]I was hoping you could help me.
[07:08.95]I was robbed on the streets by a band of thieves and I'm looking to find them.
[07:18.66]Chatters are getting destroyed right now.
[07:20.64]Her hair is making me hungry.
[07:29.81]What?
[07:30.83]I haven't had like a good spaghetti in a long time.
[07:33.23]Like linguine.
[07:35.07]Okay, do you know where I can find these thieves?
[07:38.20]No one knows where the Guild Hall is.
[07:41.55]Still, if you're determined to find them, try the sewers.
[07:46.81]But I said I would tip 80% of my bill.
[07:49.34]OK, dude.
[07:50.78]OK, I'll wager they've been using them to move around Baldur's Gate.
[07:55.59]It's probably what's been driving all those sewer rats up to the surface.
[08:00.21]80% of your bill.
[08:01.97]Oh my Lord.
[08:04.88]How do we get guess what we're doing first?
[08:08.14]We're going to the sewers to do what?
[08:11.71]To kill the bandits to kill rats actually.
[08:14.87]I locked it up a long time ago before the Guild War began.
[08:20.24]Oh, this is the prequel to Guild Wars.
[08:25.70]Actually.
[08:27.80]Maybe we can help each other out.
[08:31.02]what do you mean?
[08:32.99]I'll turn subtitles on if they're not on yeah for me the ambience is like slightly louder than her would you keep living somewhere if it was like a woman singing every couple nights in the house?
[08:58.72]I mean, what's wrong with that?
[09:00.18]Alright, hold on.
[09:01.46]Options.
[09:02.10]Like every time you try and go to bed, it's like late.
[09:04.50]Except that was wrong.
[09:06.67]Oh, dialog text.
[09:07.81]That's probably it.
[09:09.45]How we doing?
[09:09.77]You want music higher?
[09:12.67]Whoa, that's... I'm making the screen brighter.
[09:15.22]Bright.
[09:16.32]My bright-o-meter.
[09:18.32]Jesus!
[09:21.72]Oh my god!
[09:21.94]Why did that happen?
[09:23.41]Why is this happening?
[09:26.17]Okay, anyways.
[09:28.70]So, we just found our way into Baldur's Gate.
[09:33.39]Why am I helping you?
[09:35.34]I wasn't mogged.
[09:36.52]I don't know, we just are.
[09:39.18]Alright, let's get the key.
[09:41.63]Welcome, friend.
[09:43.21]I saw you come in.
[09:44.31]Nasty bump on the head you've got there.
[09:46.96]Something I can do for you?
[09:48.68]You got the key to the cellar.
[09:50.12]I do.
[09:50.91]We locked the door to the cellar once the rats started swarming around down there.
[09:55.23]Did you need it for something?
[09:56.62]I do.
[09:58.46]I need to get to the sewer gate down the cellar, but I need your key.
[10:01.02]The gate to the sewers?
[10:03.45]What do you want to get to that rusty thing for?
[10:05.79]It's been sealed for years.
[10:09.69]My business is my own.
[10:10.99]For your sake, I hope you're not planning to go after those thieves that attacked you.
[10:15.42]What do you know about that?
[10:16.50]I overheard your conversation with Aelith.
[10:18.71]Look, friend, you've met them once and escaped with your life.
[10:23.56]Don't test your luck twice.
[10:25.23]They stole every last coin from me.
[10:27.62]Okay, all they did is steal our money.
[10:30.26]We probably had like six silvers.
[10:34.12]At best.
[10:35.72]Alright, key to the cellar.
[10:38.01]Actually lock in, dude, because this game is not a joke.
[10:41.87]Okay, so... I don't know how this is going to work with multiplayer here, because if I press...
[10:56.98]uh okay what do you see I see your equipment okay what if you press a there you go okay because this is technically a couch co-op game that we are playing through the internet alright so you don't take that you need that I told you not to mess around oh dear okay I don't know I think that I I think that I look pretty protected alright are you good you're you should be good then
[11:27.33]Yeah.
[11:28.88]What about me?
[11:29.86]These all have zero defense on them.
[11:31.42]Press B for a second.
[11:34.75]Let's go.
[11:36.01]Let's go.
[11:36.37]Let's do it.
[11:40.00]Alright, we need to go.
[11:40.64]What sicko game is Jerma playing right now?
[11:43.34]This does look like it's modded.
[11:44.81]This looks like we have a nude mod.
[11:48.95]Okay.
[11:49.83]A couple of important things to note.
[11:51.53]I'm uncomfortable.
[11:53.24]What?
[11:55.86]Oh, hold on.
[11:56.12]The game's fucking loud.
[11:56.98]I don't know how to open it.
[11:57.84]It's loud.
[11:58.80]Just wait.
[11:59.16]The game is fucking loud.
[12:00.04]I need to turn this down.
[12:05.73]Oh, shit.
[12:07.81]Okay.
[12:07.93]Alright.
[12:08.41]So listen.
[12:13.14]I ain't putting them on.
[12:15.94]Here's the deal.
[12:17.47]X is attack.
[12:18.39]I don't know what you have for sorceress moves.
[12:22.24]Okay, recall potions.
[12:23.52]You can get softlocked.
[12:24.72]Why did you do that?
[12:25.70]I wanted to read that.
[12:29.37]Don't waste your mana.
[12:30.39]This game's hard.
[12:31.12]You actually should play this like it's Dark Souls.
[12:32.76]I'm learning the buttons.
[12:35.60]Can I learn?
[12:36.49]In fact, hold on a second.
[12:38.53]The joke is over.
[12:39.53]I don't want to die in one hit.
[12:41.55]Alright.
[12:42.41]So.
[12:42.93]Game is hard.
[12:44.15]It's not easy.
[12:45.92]We have to kill rats.
[12:47.66]Help me!
[12:48.08]Help me!
[12:48.60]Help me!
[12:53.67]Break stuff.
[12:54.23]We're going to need items.
[12:56.57]We don't have... There's no archer with us, but whatever.
[12:58.13]You can sell stuff.
[12:59.23]We have to make sure we sell.
[13:01.01]One hits the rat?
[13:01.94]This is so hard.
[13:02.82]With my starting dagger?
[13:04.12]Don't you guys just love that he is talking all this shit?
[13:06.46]Just wait until we get to the first fucking goblin.
[13:10.64]Is this guy scared of goblins?
[13:15.31]Money is so important.
[13:16.35]Things are expensive.
[13:17.46]Money is a big deal in this game.
[13:21.50]Alright, we get the same gear, so make sure we look at it first.
[13:23.87]Rusty sword.
[13:24.63]That should be for me.
[13:26.47]And the money.
[13:27.29]I'll take that too.
[13:30.40]You probably should take the mana stuff.
[13:34.39]How do you use potions?
[13:36.43]Left bumper and right bumper are potions.
[13:38.09]Left bumper is mana.
[13:39.77]Right bumper is healing, I believe.
[13:42.86]Okay.
[13:45.54]R1 is healing.
[13:48.54]L1 is mana.
[13:49.85]So R1 is healing.
[13:50.25]Yeah, it's on screen.
[13:51.25]Yeah, I can see.
[13:52.07]Oh, you can see this.
[13:52.85]Right, I forgot.
[13:53.43]We're in the same inventory.
[13:56.41]One to three.
[13:57.50]You got it.
[14:00.15]Alright, little pup, watch out.
[14:01.58]This game's kind of tough.
[14:02.74]Big bro is going to guide you through it.
[14:05.52]He doesn't even understand what's about to happen.
[14:09.30]We need a shitload of potions.
[14:10.39]We need to work together.
[14:11.23]We need to get just do everything good.
[14:13.61]I'm excited.
[14:14.13]I have been wanting to play this game for years.
[14:28.09]Good.
[14:28.79]Oh, I don't one-shot them because I'm a wizard.
[14:32.60]It's just rats.
[14:38.58]I'm not with you.
[14:44.37]I was in no danger.
[14:45.51]Do we share the gold?
[14:47.02]We actually... No, we don't.
[14:47.94]Okay, so you should be... We should split it because you actually do need to buy things.
[14:53.36]I mean, can't we like trade or you buy stuff for me?
[14:56.03]I don't know if we can.
[14:57.13]Maybe we can.
[15:02.27]Does the dwarf even have magic or anything?
[15:04.33]I don't think so.
[15:05.52]All the loot's a count bound.
[15:12.06]Nice job.
[15:17.91]We just keep... He keeps taking everything.
[15:20.42]Recall potions, we... He says pick it up and then he runs by and he grabs it.
[15:24.02]I actually don't remember if...
[15:27.65]I don't remember if the recall I think it just I don't know if you come back to the same spot maybe you do I don't remember 15 rats remain oh don't tell me there's gonna be one big rat at the end that makes all the rules I hope there is I'll take that ruby though

[17:26.41]So we have to make sure we get those.
[17:28.91]Alright, recall.

[17:43.12]Did you see Ethan down there?
[17:44.75]No.

[19:38.81]No, thank you.
[19:41.65]I think you're mostly going to be doing staff.
[19:44.43]Yeah, but I can't afford it.
[19:46.14]It's too expensive.
[19:47.88]I don't care.

[20:03.77]We do give a fuck.
[20:12.36]Alright, so here we go.
[20:14.42]Now the quest is... We got the sewer key.
[20:17.76]We go back to the sewer.
[20:19.10]Wait, if we recall, do we go back to where we were?
[20:23.06]I assume that the recall.
[20:26.43]We do.
[20:26.75]Okay.
[20:26.95]Oh, wow.
[20:27.73]Okay.
[20:28.69]Okay.
[20:29.03]Now.
[20:31.28]Boom.
[20:34.44]Good luck, dude.
[20:43.47]I'm the tank.
[20:46.46]Okay.
[20:46.58]Do you see my health?
[20:47.28]Do you see my health bar?
[20:48.40]Do you having fun messing around now?
[20:50.67]I'm not messing around.
[20:51.31]Are you having fun standing on stuff?
[20:52.71]Because one hit is 50% of your health.
[20:56.74]Okay.
[20:58.22]Why'd you get hit?
[21:01.34]Are you happy you had the onions?
[21:03.58]Are you glad you had the onions?
[21:11.23]I haven't been hit yet.
[21:12.35]It's just you.
[21:15.76]Ooh, yup.
[21:17.20]Oh shit, bad idea.
[21:21.16]I haven't picked up a bottle.
[21:26.19]Ooh, a quest.
[21:29.39]What drunkard gave us that quest?
[21:36.48]Menu ancient wine.
[21:42.08]Are you a jar guy?
[21:44.93]Uh, you mean like a Mason jar?
[21:45.87]No, like, yeah, when you, like, finish something...
[21:49.70]fine I have new equipment dude I have to put my new equipment on I'm trying to talk to you about jars man what do you want to know about jars do I like jars sure yeah I like them if you finish the thing and it was in a nice jar do you keep the jar if the jar is a nice glass jar sometimes yeah depends on what it is do you have a closet full of just a ton of jars then that are going unused you're gonna die
[22:26.69]Alright, gloves.
[22:29.31]You should heal, man.
[22:33.20]I don't have any healing potions.
[22:35.52]Oh, you don't have any healing potions, do you?
[22:38.33]Hold on.
[22:39.37]Here.
[22:43.31]Don't tell me I didn't split these with you.
[22:53.32]Uh, no, jars are cool.
[22:55.32]I'll take a nice jar.
[22:56.18]Battle axe and my axe.
[22:58.48]Really?
[23:00.79]I have to take a look at that in the main menu, Andy.
[23:04.69]Ah, yep.
[23:06.33]The way they can't use the shield.
[23:10.63]I think it's fine.
[23:19.30]Alright, big room here.
[23:20.60]Big pull.
[23:23.76]I'm not growing them.
[23:33.71]I'm not worried about these good options, but we only have five motions between the two of us, so.
[23:40.54]You should be slightly concerned.
[23:44.11]You keep telling me I should be horrified.
[23:46.03]Oh.
[23:50.93]Shit.
[23:52.63]So, axes, bows, we have everything you need right here.
[23:59.05]What am I doing?
[23:59.95]And we made it into the spider room.
[24:05.86]Boys and girls, the spiders are in the room.
[24:10.01]Okay.
[24:11.23]I'm gonna die.
[24:34.33]OK, do you any potions left?
[24:37.98]Good.
[24:40.32]Do you?
[24:40.96]I don't.
[24:42.02]I have one.
[24:43.30]We just keep it.
[24:44.70]We should find one right here.
[24:47.11]I'll save game.
[24:48.91]Hold on, don't do that yet.
[24:55.00]They look strawberry.
[24:57.52]Do you think health potion would taste good?
[24:59.26]Do you think it'd be gross like a lot of people think it would be?
[25:02.33]Because it's good for you, it would have to be gross.
[25:06.87]I guess that's kind of an interesting take.
[25:10.88]Alright, before we save the game, take this opportunity.
[25:17.09]Let's go in the menu.
[25:17.69]To take my clothes off?
[25:19.17]Go in the menu and make sure you got your good stuff on.
[25:22.23]There's magic missile.
[25:23.57]You don't.
[25:24.11]We haven't.
[25:25.10]Why are you skipping content?
[25:26.16]We haven't gotten there yet.
[25:27.94]That's just what it opened to.
[25:28.96]I'm sorry.
[25:34.05]You might have some better stuff.
[25:42.10]Okay.
[25:46.71]So far so good.
[25:48.85]People.
[25:54.96]What's this?
[25:55.74]You've caught a sewer rat.
[26:02.05]Oh.
[26:04.38]By being so mean?
[26:13.57]I'm not.
[26:16.32]That's the traitor.
[26:30.42]You're getting aggressive as you age like a bull elephant.
[26:34.31]The entrance you seek lies.
[26:35.90]It's true.
[26:36.92]I don't know that animal is.
[26:39.18]Let no one see you out of the temple and do exactly as you have been instructed.
[26:44.65]Now be on your way.
[26:45.55]They also get stupider as they age.
[26:49.21]I can.
[26:49.67]I can feel it man.
[26:50.43]I can.
[26:50.79]The prisoner later got him well.
[26:58.86]Alright, she just got real.
[27:04.62]What is this going to end?
[27:07.65]What?
[27:09.07]They're like, it's serious now.
[27:10.29]Pay attention.
[27:11.67]You can't break these.
[27:13.55]Do you look at these water physics?
[27:14.69]That's crazy for 2001.
[27:17.32]Yeah, a space Odyssey.
[27:20.86]Let's get us a little mini map too.
[27:22.37]Why not?
[27:28.45]Ow ow.
[27:33.22]Ow, I can't even see him in the water.
[27:39.29]Damn it.
[27:39.71]It's like we're walking around in Mercury.
[27:42.49]Like the one Better Call Saul meme.
[27:46.70]Oh, look at his room.
[27:47.70]His room is a nightmare.
[27:48.68]Okay, when I open the door, you have to hold your fire down and burn.
[27:58.43]Why are you not going with the plan?
[28:01.05]I did it.
[28:06.05]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[28:08.43]I might die too.
[28:10.89]Why are these rats three times stronger than the other rats, but look the same?
[28:14.88]Hey, what I tell you game what the game just got real.
[28:21.16]They're the same rats.
[28:23.65]Hold on.
[28:25.05]You're going to come back right now.
[28:32.56]Where's the last one?
[28:35.12]Okay.
[28:39.70]I'm gonna save it here because we could softlock ourselves.
[28:42.60]I'm not even kidding.
[28:43.26]Yeah.
[28:43.84]Shit just got bad.
[28:45.78]Alright.
[28:46.07]Shit's getting real.
[28:47.05]Pressure!
[28:48.39]Let me out!
[28:58.74]No healing potions?
[28:59.69]What is this bullshit?
[29:04.15]He gets mad over everything.
[29:08.59]Shit just got real.
[29:09.85]I know it, yeah.
[29:10.65]He's like a bull elephant.
[29:13.03]Oh my god, there's too many.
[29:14.39]I'm running.
[29:18.70]Nice!
[29:19.16]Okay, finally.
[29:23.38]Potion on the ground.
[29:28.03]Lorma on the corner.
[29:32.01]Oh, he doesn't listen to my calls.
[29:33.63]I was in the middle of a swing.
[29:44.04]Okay, that was a tough pull.
[29:48.57]I leveled up.
[29:49.75]I'm going to wait for you so we can both do it at the same time so we don't have to do any of this bullshit.
[29:56.42]Take my shield, people are saying.
[30:01.10]Oh, it is making me do it now.
[30:04.13]Accuracy.
[30:07.63]No, what do you think I should do?
[30:11.10]I'm going to say toughness.
[30:14.36]toughness for sure okay uh here let me give this to you well how do I I look did I not level up you didn't you see there are the green bar oh I'm noob you are the tank to use the shield I will eventually we're doing fine
[30:41.84]We could go back and sell and try to buy potions and stuff.
[30:45.54]Or are you scared?
[30:46.42]How are you doing?
[30:46.84]You should level up first.
[30:47.80]Ow!
[30:51.83]I'm not scared.
[30:53.83]I can tell you that much is that I'm not scared.
[30:59.54]Okay.
[30:59.66]Do they deal damage through the shield or can I just safely block?
[31:02.66]I'm pretty sure it's very high percentage.
[31:05.27]It's like 90%.
[31:06.19]It might even be 100%.
[31:11.59]It's pretty much everything is.
[31:14.33]Ooh.
[31:18.78]Cool.
[31:27.23]Make sure to check all the corners.
[31:29.87]I can block with this, but I don't think it's very useful.
[31:33.36]Ooh.
[31:35.30]Whoops, I potioned.
[31:37.79]Those are so rare.
[31:39.10]I know, but the buttons are weird.
[31:42.42]I'm turning into an elephant, dude.
[31:59.30]Okay.
[31:59.42]Oh, mine.
[32:00.99]You should... I think I have one.
[32:04.49]I just used my last one.
[32:07.33]Alright, we should go left.
[32:11.43]Hey, steam.
[32:13.57]Careful.
[32:14.22]Oh, I've been in the substructure.
[32:15.96]I know what this is.
[32:17.32]And I don't think we can touch this.
[32:21.29]We have to turn it off probably.
[32:25.37]What do you mean?
[32:25.81]Probably probably.
[32:28.08]Haven't you played this?
[32:28.88]20 years ago.
[32:32.14]Oh, we gotta go through the rats.
[32:34.25]Yeah.
[32:39.24]The rats hurt.
[32:46.08]So does the toxic water.
[32:48.95]Do you imagine how like proud they must have been of this water?
[32:52.29]I would have been proud of it.
[32:53.47]It's cool.
[32:54.96]The huge leap in.
[32:57.86]Pause.
[33:00.80]Burning hands.
[33:03.74]in in intestinal fortitude intestinal fortitude that you get health actually that's kind of crazy so I can just eat any pork out of any backpack um I think magic missile is probably what you should be getting or intestinal fortitude how do I switch spells to do magic missile that's a great question
[33:30.59]I'm sure it's like left trigger or right trigger, maybe.
[33:34.51]Oh, there you go.
[33:40.38]So you have to select... Oh god, what the fuck?
[33:44.62]Does it only go one way?
[33:46.98]No, it goes both ways.
[33:47.92]I just didn't know I'd have to go that far around.
[33:52.03]I'm going to learn every spell in the universe.
[33:54.55]Well, don't do that because then you... Okay, now we're cooking.
[33:59.58]Magic missile.
[34:01.52]Did you know magic missile can't miss?
[34:04.66]I bet you didn't know that.
[34:06.44]Can it actually not miss even if you're like 100 yards away?
[34:10.35]It's that's its thing is it can't miss.
[34:13.61]I guess if I cast magic missile at you.
[34:17.37]I'm getting hit.
[34:18.43]There's nothing you can do about it unless you cast shield.
[34:20.46]Okay, but if I can, if you cast it at me and you're like in a different country.
[34:25.94]As long as you're within the range of the spell, dude.
[34:31.76]I took so much damage, dude.
[34:36.46]Costs a lot of mana, I'll tell you that much.
[34:39.23]That's why you're gonna be chugging.
[34:45.08]How much money do you have?
[34:45.78]Okay, you gotta start picking up money.
[34:51.48]How can I pick up the money if you're picking up the money?
[34:53.35]I don't know, but I'm a dwarf.
[34:54.55]That's what we do.
[34:56.21]Exactly.
[34:57.37]And I'm an elf and I like nature.
[35:00.48]Why don't the trees talk the way they used to?
[35:03.04]Wait, can we go down?
[35:10.83]Maybe like down this way.
[35:13.37]Wasn't there steam over here?
[35:14.43]Maybe can we sneak through here?
[35:17.84]Ooh, there is a little sneaky little bite.
[35:23.08]True.
[35:29.35]Nice.
[35:31.16]Can I get a goddamn staff?
[35:32.48]1 to 4.
[35:34.46]These sell for a lot.
[35:35.24]We should go back and sell some stuff.
[35:47.88]Hey, you still Team Edward?
[35:49.58]Why do you guys keep saying that?
[35:51.10]I haven't been Team Edward ever.
[35:59.65]Ooh.
[36:02.88]I put it in the tags a while back.
[36:04.85]Wait, Josh, you put that in the... That's why people ask me that every few weeks?
[36:10.13]I feel like every few... I've been wondering why some people ask me that.
[36:19.75]I thought people were just weird.
[36:21.17]Like, why do you care about Twilight?
[36:23.00]It's been like fucking 15 years.
[36:26.42]It's in the... Oh, that's funny.
[36:32.47]Oh, watch out.
[36:32.95]There's a big ghoul in here.
[36:34.19]Is there?
[36:35.31]Yeah, I remember this.
[36:48.08]Get that money.
[36:51.08]Hey, get that.
[36:51.84]Hey, get that bag here, man.
[36:53.19]Get that bag.
[37:03.04]Um, we're kind of just going this way, I guess.
[37:08.37]Why people minus doing me?
[37:16.21]I'm.
[37:17.77]Are you therefore I am flag.
[37:19.89]Oh my God, I'm dead.
[37:24.52]By the way, if you die, we have to go back to that save point.
[37:28.15]Go back to the save point.
[37:29.31]Don't do it.
[37:29.69]Don't do it.
[37:30.15]I'm not kidding.
[37:30.79]Seriously, leave.
[37:33.10]If you die here, we go back like 30 minutes.
[37:36.72]I'm going to beat him.
[37:37.58]Don't beat him.
[37:38.30]He's going to kill you in one hit and we're going to lose 40 minutes of progress.
[37:45.87]When he showed up, my game paused for a second or two.
[37:49.18]Really?
[37:49.48]I didn't even get to see you die.
[37:52.64]Uh, well, yeah, this point was far back.
[37:55.00]How do I see the map right trigger?
[37:59.45]That's block.
[38:02.27]They call that left dude.
[38:04.33]It's right for me and if you hit it twice and you get it many there you go.
[38:11.00]Are you still a Virgo Libra?
[38:13.66]You don't really change that.
[38:15.34]That doesn't something you don't like.
[38:16.44]Just pick what you feel like.
[38:17.61]If you're whatever your sign is, that's what it was stamped on you from the cosmos.
[38:23.96]true okay hi do we save again I think that's a good idea alright you want to go try to kill that guy no but we have to it's our call to action to duty he's gonna kill me in one hit and you need to burn him I'll distract him
[38:55.84]Oh my God, dude that.
[38:59.60]Like what the hell?
[39:05.11]I like it with the big green shoes.
[39:15.14]I gotta go this way.
[39:17.92]What was on the ground?
[39:29.43]Alright, time to die.
[39:33.76]Should I just block him?
[39:37.70]Let's get rid of the adds first.
[39:42.11]Can you believe the Earth Mother let me leave my house like this?
[39:48.44]That's crazy.
[39:49.22]I kind of want to look at this mace.
[39:58.03]It's a piece of shit.
[39:58.73]Never mind.
[40:01.80]alright here he comes he's scary and he's huge let me 1v1 him let me solo him okay he's faster than me
[40:28.92]Oh, don't hit me.
[40:30.16]Oh, wait a minute.
[40:30.62]We actually can do this.
[40:31.30]This works.
[40:38.57]He's so fast.
[40:40.79]I can't even hit him.
[40:46.56]I thought Magic Missile can't miss.
[40:56.34]Nice.
[40:58.23]I like that strat.
[41:04.88]OK, this stuff.
[41:07.60]Padded helmet plus one.
[41:09.24]Hold on.
[41:10.71]Will you just take everything?
[41:21.18]These are kind of good.
[41:22.28]What do you have for gloves?
[41:24.37]Just some gloves, just some.
[41:26.85]Old worn dirty gloves.
[41:29.66]Well here, take these.
[41:37.12]What do I have for gloves right now?
[41:40.13]Added gloves.
[41:41.75]I think these are better.

[42:33.23]OK, she does not poke with it.
[42:35.09]This is not how you use.
[42:37.55]OK, I think we're just wrapping into where we just work and there's a safe point right here and is OK.
[42:43.10]Be careful.
[42:45.18]Save it over here first.
[42:46.04]That's an instant death for both of us if we're not careful.
[42:53.11]Okay, now we can just load right here.
[42:57.86]Maybe you should just try to... Yeah, maybe just... Oh my God, what are you doing?
[43:04.49]I wanted to go from the top.
[43:06.61]I thought you were gonna... Give me the shield back.
[43:14.92]Here, I'll tank.
[43:21.10]I can't go over there, man.
[43:39.99]You gotta go not in a straight line where they're throwing it at me.
[43:53.70]Oh my goodness, there's so many throwing.
[43:59.75]We have to kill some.
[44:16.56]Alright, now we pick up the spoils of war.
[44:26.07]Oops, I pulled the levers.
[44:27.66]I think that's fine.
[44:36.95]We should probably save it.
[44:38.91]We also should probably go back as well.
[44:43.10]Yeah, let's go back.

[53:12.61]He's going to run into something.
[53:16.57]Everybody got pet rats.
[53:17.90]I think there was some people that had pet rats.

[53:28.25]Am I making that up?
[53:30.91]Magic missile kind of stinks.
[53:34.09]We have to level it up.
[53:37.54]It has one level.
[53:42.48]Oh, what's in the moon tent?
[53:45.09]I remember seeing people post rats before being like, hey, these are my rats.
[53:48.89]I think even when I stood there after the stream ended, kind of bit readings.
[53:53.22]I think they were a couple times when people were like, hey, look, there's a picture of my rats.
[53:59.27]We got rat owners here.
[54:12.18]Watch out, he's gonna bait us.
[54:21.03]Are you gonna do fire?

[54:32.01]Ouch.
[54:43.69]Oh, this is a this is a classic.
[54:51.48]I don't think there's anything over here, but there might be.
[54:53.84]No, no.
[54:57.24]There's also Dark Alliance 2, which is effectively the same game as this, but.
[55:02.07]Again.
[55:03.73]Again, do you go to the sewers in the beginning?
[55:06.18]You actually might.
[55:14.70]I go, dude, I have to sneeze again?

[55:26.32]I cut in line the other day and the person behind me was a witch.
[55:33.38]And she shook a voodoo doll at me.
[55:35.59]Were you there when we used to talk about do you think that you would make it if you sneezed ten times in your life, you'd die instantly on the tenth sneeze?

[56:23.36]That's why you have more gold.
[56:24.51]No, it's not.
[56:33.15]OK, see, look, you're picking up the things you're picking up.

[61:02.74]Somebody was like this.
[61:03.86]It's impossible man.
[61:09.19]You didn't take that guy's word for it.

[62:53.09]I you can take as long as you want.
[62:56.28]You should collect all this stuff.
[63:00.12]Do the leather gloves.
[63:02.55]That's I'm excited.
[63:04.75]I'm really into that.
[63:09.22]OK, if you had something today, what would you eat?
[63:13.42]If I was going to eat today, yeah, like what would you if you could choose a food, what would you choose?
[63:20.20]I am going to eat today right but I mean like if you would choose a food and I'll get it for me okay so I'm choosing for you not for me you are why didn't you ask it that way because I want just wanted to get the honest response uh I don't know what's in your fridge I think you should get something from your fridge okay broccoli
[63:44.02]I think you should uh learn to cook rice without it being frozen for you oh stop he's gonna pull this shit now okay okay go ahead go ahead I'll defend it I'll defend it okay guys he's a frozen rice Andy
[64:02.44]No, I am.
[64:03.60]Okay.
[64:05.82]I have a rice cooker.
[64:07.92]It just, it doesn't work.
[64:10.53]And in the interim, in the interim.
[64:14.13]It works.
[64:15.56]It works.
[64:17.46]Let me tell my story before I bash this into your head.
[64:20.28]The first time you use like a rice cooker or something, it kind of like, it like burns a little.
[64:24.61]Like the oil, like, you know, you wear it in.
[64:28.63]He tried to use it one time.
[64:30.09]It didn't work right.
[64:31.67]It smelled weird to him.
[64:32.93]He's done with it.
[64:34.75]He threw it in the trash.
[64:35.96]Brand new.
[64:36.50]And now he only buys frozen rice.
[64:39.46]Because he's like, it's just easier.
[64:41.00]Like, who has time for rice?
[64:43.03]The other day, he was like, oh, you have to, like, wash it?
[64:45.07]Like, what is all this shit?
[64:46.09]Back when I was young, you didn't have to, like, wash your rice.
[64:48.77]Like, what chemicals are they putting on it?
[64:50.40]And then he turned on, like, Alex Jones and just started, like, zoning out to it.
[64:58.98]Only one of those statements is true.
[65:02.99]Okay?
[65:03.37]Yeah, pick which one.
[65:04.59]That's a lot.
[65:05.27]I said a lot there.
[65:06.66]Okay.
[65:07.70]It could have been any of those.
[65:09.24]First of all, Trader Joe's.
[65:13.43]We did a Trader Joe's run.
[65:14.79]We went to Trader Joe's.
[65:15.59]It was delicious.
[65:16.25]Look at all this stuff we got.
[65:17.57]Trader Joe's has frozen rice.
[65:19.34]And it was like, what is this?
[65:20.10]Frozen rice?
[65:21.38]You put it in the microwave?
[65:22.66]That's kind of interesting.
[65:23.82]We bought two boxes of this stuff.
[65:26.73]That's it.
[65:27.31]Two boxes.
[65:28.13]Two boxes.
[65:28.87]It's six servings.
[65:32.07]Six servings of rice is what he is.
[65:34.10]Six servings of rice is what he is.
[65:36.92]So broken up.
[65:37.48]That is too, too many.
[65:38.97]You can get like a giant sack of rice for like 80 cents.
[65:42.41]I know you can.
[65:43.37]It was just we wanted rice.
[65:44.83]Our rice cooker was messed up.
[65:47.32]So we were like, hey, let's just do this.
[65:49.16]I know it's not messed up.
[65:50.86]It's a brand new rice cooker.
[65:53.95]It's just you used it for the first time.
[65:56.47]Were you just going to leave that guy in the cell?
[65:57.87]Well, we have to... Let's make sure we get all the stuff.
[66:01.19]Use a pot.
[66:01.87]See, this guy has a loot before quest.
[66:04.82]We do.
[66:05.64]Don't let him gaslight you.
[66:12.82]That's what you get.
[66:17.27]I think at the time you said making rice is too hard was the quote.
[66:21.05]No, I didn't.
[66:23.80]did not say that thank the gods you're here do not let him put that into your heads belly making rice is too hard I that never came out of my mouth except for right now well after I gave you the cellar door key I felt guilty about letting you head down here without help you guys are in a propaganda duel right now down here then I'm surrounded by that's true devils and they haul me to this cell and lock me
[66:51.83]He thinks rice is too spicy.
[66:56.87]I... That's... I like spicy food.
[67:01.60]Alright, you want to talk spicy food?
[67:03.70]There's somebody in this call that has never had Tabasco in their life.
[67:07.75]Who cares?
[67:09.67]And... And... You told me I bought it like a year ago and I just won't try it.
[67:22.12]Here's this.
[67:23.74]I did propaganda.
[67:25.40]Oh, so the.
[67:28.12]The propaganda can get flipped another way.
[67:31.93]I'd rather be the guy who hasn't tried Tabasco rather than the guy who said.
[67:36.45]Making rice is too hard.
[67:37.80]That's not what happened.
[67:41.50]Well, I was.
[67:41.78]I was going to try the Tabasco, but like opening the bottle and putting it on the food was too hard.
[67:47.95]That is, yeah, you just said that.
[67:56.39]You actually should put it on food, though.
[67:58.27]It's really good.
[67:59.99]I don't have any over this.
[68:01.84]I went in the fridge and it wasn't even Tabasco.
[68:03.98]Oh, that's right.
[68:04.42]You got the wrong one.
[68:05.34]Oh, to town.
[68:09.27]Wait, wait.
[68:11.81]There was another room there.
[68:13.23]Was there?
[68:14.59]Yeah.
[68:18.02]Up here.
[68:18.72]Oh shit.
[68:19.34]Or is that just go further down?
[68:20.46]I think this is the next level.
[68:21.58]Yeah, we should go to town.
[68:25.35]Speaking of propaganda, people are saying that Sriracha is better than Tabasco.
[68:30.02]Oh my god, I love Sriracha.
[68:32.32]No, you're one of those people.
[68:34.96]You're one of those dumb people that think Sriracha is better than Tabasco.
[68:38.55]Okay.
[68:39.95]Well, there's certain food products here.
[68:43.08]in the glorious texan heb made by Henry butts they have sriracha hummus and it is top tier oh my god don't it that's it's wild saying sriracha is better than tabasco is like such that's like such a Reddit opinion you guys are alright I don't even have to try tabasco because I've had sriracha right
[69:16.53]You're a Redditor.
[69:17.96]Yeah, that's how I know.
[69:21.31]Thanks for the rescue down in the sewers, friend.
[69:24.39]I feel like a right fool for not heeding my own advice and staying clear of that place.
[69:28.99]Says the frozen rice guy.
[69:30.98]Now they're going to say that for every opinion.
[69:33.02]I could be talking about anything else for the next 10 years.
[69:36.54]I could be like, guys, you know, I went to the store today and it was interesting.
[69:40.49]I got these large brown eggs and I was thinking of making an omelet.
[69:44.97]It's like, oh, your opinion doesn't matter.
[69:46.64]Frozen rice, Andy.
[69:50.10]Were they frozen eggs?
[69:54.87]My reputation is ruined now.
[69:57.07]If I bring up any food topic, Hey guys, I actually am not a fan of, um, you know, a green bell peppers.
[70:02.38]I don't really love them on pizza.
[70:04.64]It's just the guy that likes frozen rice and they're going to have that forever.
[70:07.89]They can use that every time.
[70:09.25]You have to imagine while you're cooking the frozen rice in the microwave, that Gordon Ramsay is just looking over your shoulder and the face he has.
[70:19.46]Oh shit.
[70:20.70]Okay.
[70:22.20]Yeah.
[70:23.96]He'd be pissed.
[70:24.95]He would not be happy about it.
[70:27.46]I love Gordo, and that's why I don't own a microwave at all.
[70:30.25]Have you seen his new show?
[70:33.72]I don't think so.
[70:34.51]It is the stupidest, funniest, dumb fucking show I've ever seen in my life.
[70:39.21]It's called Secret Agent or something.
[70:41.14]Secret Agent, Secret Service with Gordon Ramsay.
[70:45.12]And what apparently he does is he goes to a restaurant, you know, because he's, you know, like Sacha Baron Cohen, how it's like, oh, Sacha Baron Cohen, like Borat and Bruno.
[70:55.89]He's done it so many times that people just know.
[70:58.03]Like, oh, that's Borat.
[70:59.80]That's Sacha Baron Cohen.
[71:01.56]Oh, it's Borat.
[71:02.62]Everybody knows who it is.
[71:03.64]Gordon has like undercover guy.
[71:05.26]He's had a bunch of those where he like goes into the restaurant and like, like a mustache and stuff.
[71:10.37]So because of that and because he's doing, he's on a kick of those.
[71:13.95]Now, instead of just showing up, he does a stakeout of the restaurant and puts hidden cameras in the whole restaurant and films them.
[71:21.80]Well, they don't know what I'm, they don't know that I'm here watching them.
[71:25.36]Like he hasn't introduced that it's him, Gordon Ramsay there.
[71:29.62]And there's always, always, in every episode it feels like, there is a rat cam.
[71:36.12]And it's like, hold on a minute.
[71:38.09]Let's check on the rat cam.
[71:39.45]And he cuts to the rat cam and they just see, it's like a little rat running by every time they cut to it.
[71:45.50]I was hoping it was gonna be on their back.
[71:48.51]And you get the rat cam of, like, it going underneath the fridge and stuff.
[71:52.09]But he, like, sneaks around.
[71:53.50]He goes in.
[71:54.32]Oh, it's late at night.
[71:55.84]Nobody knows I'm here.
[71:57.36]Late at night.
[71:58.36]I snuck.
[71:58.82]I broke into their restaurant.
[72:00.29]It's like, that's not happening, but it's funny that we're pretending.
[72:02.95]And he's got a knife in one hand.
[72:04.55]no but he's like he's sneaking around the flashlight and it's so funny because there's a whole camera crew with him so yeah there's like nine guys that are there it's it's not just Gordon Ramsay with a flashlight and he brings in this you know he does the the fluorescence and stuff and uh let's take a look oh disgust look at this grease they don't know I'm in here let's go into the fridge the walk-in fridge oh oh it's awful they don't know I'm here they could they could they can't hide it because they didn't know I was coming
[72:35.13]Yeah, I think they signed the release already.
[72:37.76]I think that's the funniest part, is somebody had to let them in.
[72:41.76]Right?
[72:42.10]Somebody, and that's the thing, they have an insider.
[72:45.89]And one of the dramatic parts of an episode, every episode, is where, as an audience member, you are supposed to figure out who the insider is who gave him the keys, who is feeding him all the information.
[72:58.91]that's that's hilarious can you imagine someone sneaking into your house and like a camera crew's following them and they think that they're like oh he's hiding behind the counter and you can see a camera crew with like lights and a boom mic it's just the show it's in every shot
[73:16.19]He's in a truck outside their restaurant.
[73:18.57]It's like, you don't know he's in there.
[73:20.35]It's like, oh, like Davey's Donuts.
[73:22.98]It's like, okay, that's definitely a guy in there.
[73:25.78]And he has a whole command base.
[73:28.25]He has a joystick that he can change cameras and zoom in on people's faces.
[73:32.87]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[73:33.23]I don't think that's that new.
[73:34.57]I've seen these.
[73:35.60]It's great.
[73:37.64]It's a secret.
[73:38.40]Yeah.
[73:38.98]It's so funny.
[73:40.14]He has the transformer car that turns into like an Autobot.
[73:45.01]my mobile kitchen hell's kitchen and it starts transforming and like they teach people to cook in it oh it is so funny though because he took what else is this wait no hold on Chad is question marking me that is real he has a truck that transforms into a kitchen look it up what yes
[74:12.26]was his previous show uh what was the name of that one like what's the new one I want to see it it's the new one's called like secret service or I don't know secret agent or something
[74:22.02]And it's just all the other shows he's ever done.
[74:24.10]But this time, the first 10 minutes is him breaking into their restaurant and getting evidence of how awful this place is before he introduces himself.
[74:34.71]So then when he goes... He should lay traps.
[74:36.76]Well, when he's like, oh, you're a donkey.
[74:38.20]They're like, I'm not a donkey.
[74:39.28]What are you talking about?
[74:39.88]He's like, oh, yeah, I was here three days ago.
[74:43.17]And it's like, oh, no, there's no way he was here.
[74:46.03]He saw the rotten fucking chicken in the walk-in freezer.
[74:48.67]There's no way he must have broken in.
[74:54.01]Was he going to their bedrooms?
[74:55.75]It's in the restaurant.
[74:58.28]It's just the restaurant.
[74:59.10]He's fucking donkey.
[75:00.06]I went in your bedroom and you had the Hatsune Miku full-length pillow.
[75:05.29]No!
[75:09.03]You haven't cleaned your toilet in years!
[75:11.17]I can see the orange ring where the piss is!
[75:14.14]It's disgusting!
[75:16.72]Get in there with a wand and clean it!
[75:21.11]Yeah, he should do their whole home.
[75:23.18]Like, while they're in the restaurant, he goes to their house.
[75:27.38]I'm gonna find some dirt.
[75:28.32]And he goes through their documents and stuff.
[75:31.03]He does, like, the doctor house.
[75:32.79]Do you remember House?
[75:33.77]Did you ever watch House?
[75:35.67]Yeah, yeah, I saw it all.
[75:37.06]Oh, yeah.
[75:37.68]Just, you know, break into their house.
[75:39.38]See if you can find anything while you break into their apartment.
[75:41.64]You know, if you care, I don't know.
[75:44.05]They would break into somebody's house every episode.
[75:46.65]Did you see Barry?
[75:48.71]The first season.
[75:50.59]uh there's the whole thing where he's explaining of like oh yeah I could like break into that guy's house for you like I could just move things around like I could move his soap and stuff I could make him freak out make sure you sell oh that short bow is kind of a lot do you want this the bow
[76:18.66]if you're trying to find something to crack someone's skull or help to protect your arm I love this guy I can't believe we've only leveled one time yeah the game's hard man yeah I don't know the pacing's kind of off for me I got an ambula of dexterity jealous
[76:49.64]We should be level 30 by now.
[76:53.33]I think I'm going to invest.
[77:02.86]Sell my arrows or I'll cry.
[77:04.22]He was just offering to give me a bow.
[77:06.04]I sold the bow.
[77:07.90]I think I'm going to get some armor.
[77:16.09]I'm getting the good shit.
[77:16.92]Wait, we have weight?
[77:21.33]Yeah, boy.
[77:24.04]Oh, we've got deals.
[77:32.73]See what I picked up?
[77:33.35]Oh, there's deals.
[77:38.88]Let's see how cool I look in it when I'm done.
[77:45.51]Oh.
[77:46.09]Wait, no, that was by...
[77:49.36]Oh, I just got scammed.
[77:51.06]You just lost 30% of your gold that you bought it with.
[77:54.10]I'm still thinking about Gordo.
[77:57.35]I don't need anything.
[78:05.84]Are you good?
[78:06.44]Alright, so let's turn all this stuff in.
[78:09.48]Thank you for finding Ethan.
[78:12.18]Here's some coins for your trouble.
[78:13.80]Oh money.
[78:14.90]You're welcome to rest here.
[78:18.20]This isn't the place for that.
[78:20.74]Talk to Ethon.
[78:22.52]Welcome back, friend.
[78:24.07]And thanks again for that rescue down in the sewers.
[78:25.97]Okay, so we have to find the thief.
[78:26.91]Did you find that thief who was running around down there?
[78:32.23]It's fucking Gordon.
[78:34.98]I showed up before and then found their whole sewer.
[78:37.78]Let's see where all the goblins are.
[78:40.52]Cutthroats over the years.
[78:42.62]That's probably why there's that gate.
[78:46.75]So I think we need to...
[78:48.46]Whoa, you do look cool.
[78:49.66]What?
[78:50.14]I look cool.
[78:50.70]I told you.

[78:54.55]Alright, right now we have the medallion.
[78:56.73]Okay, we have to go to the crypts.
[78:58.45]Will this guy talk to us now?
[79:01.59]No.
[79:02.52]What about you?
[79:05.02]Please, leave me be.
[79:07.74]I want no trouble.
[79:10.51]I've been waiting for someone who you waiting for my man kissing had just gone on an expedition into the north to a place called battle of the bones oh he has a talent for the shadowy arts
[79:24.23]She looks like she wears cat ears.
[79:27.34]Yeah.
[79:32.06]Find the orb.
[79:45.28]Find the orb.
[79:54.22]oh no the orb hopefully it's not sun orb so when we get to the bottom of the sewer is it like diablo down there friend maybe and thanks again for that rescue down in the sewers did you find that thief who was running around down there
[80:14.81]I'm still keeping my ear.
[80:16.35]I think we should keep going friend, but nothing yet.
[80:18.63]Let's just keep going.
[80:21.52]Seems like a real sewer Delver delve into the sewers that we just recall background.
[80:26.32]No, no, we didn't recall it all.
[80:27.51]Yeah, we go into the town.
[80:30.13]We just go.
[80:31.83]We unlocked in a shortcut.
[80:34.21]Is there another building here?
[80:35.96]They might be been a while since I played.
[80:44.20]How come all these people aren't getting mugged?
[80:46.57]Just us?
[80:47.25]Because they don't have gold on them.
[80:53.84]Oh, dude, if only we could leave here and go explore the rest of Tamriel.
[80:58.27]Is that in Baldur's Gate 3?
[80:59.51]The only one you've played?
[81:06.18]No, dude, that's Elder Scrolls.
[81:09.05]Oh.
[81:10.29]Well, that's funny because I didn't play either one of them.
[81:11.89]Well, I did play Baldur's Gate 3.
[81:14.48]The vampire sucked my blood to death and then me and Holly quit the game.
[81:18.74]I just let him.
[81:20.26]It was like probably 12 hours into the game.
[81:22.12]He's like, oh, do you mind if I try to taste you a little bit or whatever he says?
[81:25.67]And I said, sure, maybe this would be funny.
[81:28.25]And it said, let him keep going.
[81:29.61]And then it said, let him keep going.
[81:30.69]And I did.
[81:31.05]And then it said, let him keep going.
[81:32.07]And I did.
[81:32.39]And I died.
[81:32.99]And then we quit the game.
[81:37.16]That's the best place to stop.
[81:39.33]Yeah, I'm not.
[81:39.89]I actually am not kidding.
[81:41.02]We have not played it since then.
[81:42.92]A year ago.
[81:45.98]Dude, he's mad.
[81:46.76]I bet you were super mad.
[81:51.79]I was.
[81:55.47]Alright, let's keep moving.

[82:15.19]But I mean before I mean before this, I'm going to block.
[82:18.27]Yes, I did.
[82:18.90]I did.
[82:23.86]That's amazing how that works with with just one person.
[82:28.17]That's what I'm saying.
[82:28.91]The game is like insanely hard alone.
[82:34.40]Careful.
[82:42.33]shield is lp huh fine staff hold on wait no I can't get rid of my shield the shield's op or you could be doing dps no
[83:09.87]That shield is crazy.

[83:21.51]So.
[83:25.98]Oh, I'm going down again.
[83:34.07]I'm gonna die.
[83:51.08]Don't get me.
[83:54.86]Dude, I'm locked in.
[83:56.27]You're meant to ego and ignore the shield altogether.
[83:59.13]Ego?
[84:01.17]What does that mean?
[84:02.07]Just kind of go in?
[84:02.91]Who cares?

[84:34.39]Wait, when did I get that amulet?
[84:35.98]Oh, shit.
[84:36.20]I'm going to put that on.
[84:38.97]Is this ring just doesn't do anything?
[84:41.27]Or is it a secret?
[84:42.52]I don't know.
[84:42.96]Maybe it doesn't.
[84:46.61]Maybe it's just worth money.
[84:47.41]Well, I look cute with it.
[85:04.09]Cubes.
[85:06.04]That's my favorite enemy.
[85:08.58]It's about cubes?
[85:10.02]I love D&D cubes and mimics.
[85:13.73]Big fan.
[85:15.41]What is that noise?
[85:20.03]He dropped all kinds of good shit.
[85:25.50]Oh my God, it hurts.
[85:37.10]uh let's just keep going this way who doesn't love a cube okay so are the cubes sentient or are they just kind of blobs of mass like how do they have nerves nervous I think they become sentient if enough of them combine and then they become a different thing that might be totally made up though well interesting oh god
[86:09.23]Ooh, iron shield.
[86:20.68]Don't hurt me.
[86:22.13]I have no potions.

[87:48.49]Hey, for the next Horseman stream, can you guys play Outlast?
[87:51.74]I suggested Outlast Trials and then Ster said that we're not playing that game because it's a disgusting puke game.
[87:57.86]And I looked it up and I was like, wait, this game actually is like fucked up.
[88:00.93]So maybe we're not going to play it.
[88:05.03]I did say that.
[88:15.59]Alright, we almost leveled up.
[88:17.48]Kill this thing.
[88:20.07]Oh no, I don't have any heals.
[88:23.85]I don't know what happened.
[88:36.11]We're just going to keep going back and forth.
[88:38.55]That's kind of the way it is.
[88:42.15]We need some better gear.
[88:43.15]We have.
[88:43.65]We need to level.
[88:45.14]We're so close to level three.
[88:48.16]I think three.
[88:49.36]Two.
[88:51.22]Well, it depends if they start levels at zero, which they should.
[88:55.06]I'll avenge you.
[88:58.99]I'll avenge you.
[89:00.23]Alright.
[89:03.13]Get him.
[89:03.89]I leveled up.
[89:20.46]Gain 15 pounds.
[89:24.40]I could do that without a level.
[89:29.91]What if I did mana regen as a joke?
[89:40.70]Sword and fist.
[89:46.40]What was death blow?
[89:50.28]Let's do more.
[89:54.24]Maybe just help maybe health region.
[89:57.53]I'm going to be boring.
[89:59.09]Let's be boring.
[90:03.00]Winning isn't boring.
[90:14.58]Unless you're winning so much, you're bored of winning.
[90:19.05]winning remember that exactly I do remember that I was there I was in the room winning dude that region actually is kind of good
[90:50.61]that's ticking pretty well I might do it I might do it again you like don't have to use potions if you're not fighting I'm following you my liege let's go this way cube
[91:19.72]Pick up everything to sell.
[91:24.84]This way.
[91:30.17]Ouch.
[91:33.71]Okay, you can level up.
[91:36.93]A fine spear.
[91:39.49]That one's fine.
[91:41.76]Level up.
[91:43.84]When do I get to learn spells, dude?
[91:46.74]Fireball, snow blind, lightning bolt.
[91:48.52]You need...
[91:52.01]What do you need to do this?
[91:53.26]You need.
[91:53.74]I think you need more points.
[91:57.36]Cost one cost.
[91:58.70]Well, OK, so you need more points.
[92:04.13]I guess I'm leveling burning hands.
[92:06.48]Either that or.
[92:08.72]One of the main intestinal fortitude.
[92:15.43]Like that's not terrible either.
[92:18.31]You get extra points every level.
[92:20.59]So you get more.
[92:21.43]I think level 3 is 3 points.
[92:23.51]Level 4 is 4 points probably.
[92:31.34]Nothing.
[92:41.55]Nothing?
[92:43.67]Nothing.
[92:51.80]He popped with loot.
[92:55.23]Dude, that guy was like a pimple.
[92:59.17]Warhammer.
[93:01.62]Oh, this thing stinks.
[93:09.77]Save it.
[93:19.34]This is the most bait title this streamer has ever done.
[93:21.97]I'm going insane.
[93:23.45]I don't even know what the title is.
[93:25.51]It says Baldur's Gate, parentheses, no, not that one.
[93:28.96]I think that's pretty clear.
[93:30.48]That's a good one.
[93:31.79]Actually, who made that title?
[93:34.29]One of the mods did.
[93:35.57]That's plus one mod points.
[94:00.75]no one's as rich as the man with many cheeses or something you know it's not about how much you love it's about how much you are loved by others
[94:33.20]I can't control what other people feel.
[94:36.09]That's a quote from the Wizard of Oz.
[94:37.41]That's the wizard says that.
[94:40.13]Watch out.
[94:40.63]We got Glorps.
[94:41.51]The Tin Man.
[94:42.15]I've seen that movie 700 times.
[94:46.50]I could recite the entire thing start to finish.
[94:49.94]You're waiting for the roll?
[94:51.05]They don't know you.
[94:54.17]I've seen it so many times.
[95:00.66]They don't know you.
[95:04.05]You're not going to call in.
[95:07.52]Why are you the understudy, though?
[95:13.37]I also love the Wiz as well.
[95:16.20]That's awesome.
[95:19.11]I love the music in the Wiz.
[95:23.59]Ease on down.
[95:24.43]Ease on down the road.
[95:26.82]Come on in.
[95:27.66]Ease on down.
[95:28.38]Ease on down the road.
[95:30.26]Don't you carry nothing that might be low.
[95:33.92]Come on in.
[95:34.54]Ease on down.
[95:35.29]Ease on down.
[95:43.41]He is barely being held back from doing Family Guy impressions.
[95:47.04]That's actually true.
[95:47.86]I was actually thinking about doing Stewie like half an hour ago.
[95:51.52]Why?
[95:52.58]Ow!
[96:07.74]These melted candies.
[96:10.80]They do look delicious.
[96:11.80]That's unfortunate.
[96:12.76]Oh, wait, I'm dead.
[96:14.35]Why are you dead?
[96:15.99]I didn't even notice my health was down.
[96:18.65]Oh, my God.
[96:19.09]These things hurt.
[96:21.11]Okay, where's the... Oh, it's right here.
[96:23.68]But let me partake in a little bit of a sneaky little bite.
[96:27.10]I'm just going to get all the loot.
[96:28.36]I'm never going to get this loot.
[96:31.39]We'll just get a sneaky little bite.
[96:32.65]That's all I want.
[96:41.74]Hey.
[96:47.97]Stop.
[96:48.19]Is there anything else over there?
[96:52.91]I don't think so.
[96:55.70]He got hit.
[96:57.84]Yeah, because I'm trying to keep up with you going backtracking for nothing.
[97:01.14]You just have to check.
[97:06.17]Now it's time for the Joe is hungry temperature test.
[97:18.70]and he puts his hand on the stove stares into the camera that's how I like it oh these goops are gonna get us
[97:50.19]Uh-oh, uh-oh.
[97:52.05]Left.
[97:52.53]Oh, no, dude.
[97:53.69]We're about to get cubed.
[97:56.15]Oh, you should have insta-died.
[97:59.88]They didn't make the cubes insta-kills.
[98:08.99]That's actually kind of good.
[98:11.82]That's quite good for a scimitar.
[98:13.10]Is that better than what you have?
[98:16.00]Yes.
[98:18.05]Well, you should use it.
[98:26.32]Yeah.
[98:29.66]That's a keen hand axe.
[98:31.32]By the way, I think that means something.
[98:38.37]Sims 2 pets Gameboy stream tomorrow.
[98:41.12]Let's go.
[98:46.36]Dude that you are doing that.
[98:48.31]Let's let's watch.
[98:50.47]That sounds awesome dude.
[98:51.43]That's what you're doing tomorrow.
[98:52.41]You are streaming that tomorrow.
[98:54.18]Hell yeah, man.
[98:55.20]I haven't heard of that game in a long time.
[98:56.62]I'm glad you're doing that.
[98:58.62]Yeah, log in, dude.
[99:02.40]I have no heels, so I have to be careful.
[99:06.87]There's one.
[99:11.50]We also can recall.
[99:14.14]We probably should soon.
[99:33.68]Just picking him up and eating him immediately.
[99:36.24]No loot, loot, loot.
[99:40.23]What you get?
[99:44.11]You should take this.
[99:45.98]OK.
[99:50.66]Got nothing else, right?
[99:51.50]OK.
[99:55.05]Iron Shield, hell yeah.
[99:59.87]Are you playing with the stream share thing?
[100:03.37]Yeah, we're doing the remote play.
[100:05.30]The game is not online, but you can do remote play with it, which is cool.
[100:10.10]Oh, you look cool now.
[100:12.98]Except my weird hat.
[100:14.37]Did you ever play, uh, you were Titan Quest, boy?
[100:16.59]I played it.
[100:19.11]I didn't really beat it, though.
[100:20.67]I did like it, though.
[100:28.50]Love that.
[100:30.11]Oh, no.
[100:31.31]That's a lot of goo.
[100:33.19]That's not a good place to be.
[100:33.93]I'm out of mana.
[100:34.58]We may have to go back.
[100:36.02]You want his recall here?
[100:37.48]Yeah.
[100:38.50]Hold hands.
[100:41.76]Grim Dawn.
[100:42.75]Yeah, isn't it the same people that went on to do Grim Dawn?
[100:46.05]Yeah.
[100:46.79]I'm a Titan quest enjoyer, though.
[100:48.71]I don't know.
[100:49.29]I could never get into Grim Dawn.
[100:50.41]If quality and price are your chief concerns, then look no further.
[100:53.84]I just like Titan quests too much.
[100:56.20]You'll find my shop has excellent weapons at reasonable prices.
[101:00.57]Yeah, that Keen handaxe I think means something.
[101:02.77]I don't know.
[101:03.13]I think Keen is crit.
[101:04.23]Probably you had a chance to crit or something.
[101:11.54]I'm going to drop all these because I have seven mana potions.
[101:14.72]You were just saying you don't have any.
[101:17.72]Yes.
[101:21.43]I want to buy gloves or something, but I feel like I'm going to find a pair the second I buy anything.
[101:30.93]oh just hoard everything forever I know right here all the way from the sunset mountains swords axes bows I got a lot of money what is this you do you have a lot of masterwork did you buy potions yet if you need something to split something in his double crit chance apparently you'll come to the right place
[102:02.82]swords axes bows uh do you get enough potions yeah maybe well let's go funny hold on hold on my character I'm you like paused for a second and I don't have control anymore you don't yeah no I saw like the
[102:30.48]uh the menu show up that you went into the the the thing the thing okay remote play thing alright I got you I got you hold on I got you funny I was just going to talk about how easy remote play was to get to work and it just like broke oops I mean you broke it you opened it and you did something hold on
[102:57.02]if you had to pick one thing to eat yeah what would you eat it's getting late you have control again I don't you have to be out of that menu for me to be able to do anything you good let me see I think you still have the this is your menu yep hey look at that um
[103:25.78]Yeah, so remote play actually works pretty well.
[103:28.52]I thought it's going to be laggy or screen sharey, but does it look like a 4K 1080p?
[103:35.05]Every once in a while I get like some lag and there's a slight delay on my input, but it works really well.
[103:44.72]Alright, just just just charging.
[103:53.92]Oh.
[103:57.13]Ow.
[103:58.23]Well, it's a good thing we... Where is the save point back here?
[104:04.30]It's far back.
[104:07.89]Hey, I'll get you.
[104:09.07]I'll avenge you.
[104:14.56]Yeah, if you're going to eat, then you need to start thawing the rice now.
[104:20.39]You put it in the microwave for... It's like a minute or something.
[104:28.60]And it's Trader Joe's.
[104:29.63]You like Trader Joe's.
[104:36.24]You specifically told me.
[104:37.72]It's Trader Joe's?
[104:38.76]Okay.
[104:39.46]That's cool then.
[104:42.09]He doesn't get a pass.
[104:47.15]Two hours in a microwave.
[104:52.82]Okay, what is the radioactive version of burning something?
[104:56.34]You know, oh, I left my steak on for too long and I burnt it.
[104:59.49]Oh, I burnt it on the stove.
[105:01.13]Ah, I burnt it.
[105:05.01]The radio, I think it's, um... Like, do you burn, does it burn in the microwave or does it turn into, like, an alien?
[105:12.12]Doesn't it just make it, like, smaller?
[105:15.08]Well, you're removing all the moisture out of it effectively, right?
[105:17.80]Well, it makes it smaller because it's a microwave.
[105:24.01]All mine.
[105:24.73]I'll let that one slide.
[105:29.85]Sorry, I was reading chat.
[105:35.24]Okay, there's monsters!
[105:36.70]Okay, be careful up here.
[105:37.55]Monsters in the kitchen!
[105:38.77]Oh, they're disgusting!
[105:41.13]My.
[105:41.85]Bro.
[105:42.77]Wave.
[105:46.94]Dude, I don't think I can, like, full block these.
[105:52.57]Get good.
[106:11.63]No, wait, where did my health go?
[106:12.95]There might be one in here.
[106:15.83]I thought I was fine.
[106:20.22]I thought I was fine.
[106:23.42]These things keep just out of nowhere, blurping me.
[106:28.19]What's that open?
[106:29.49]A secret door, probably.
[106:32.88]Pick up that potion.
[106:35.08]You can get it in a second.
[106:35.86]You crazy?
[106:36.46]Oh, wait, we're not coming back here.
[106:38.07]I'm not coming back there.
[106:41.32]But his experience should I kill him?
[106:44.22]Sure, I mean they're weaker.
[106:45.40]If you can.
[106:52.92]Look at me planking.
[106:58.77]These really are flat.
[107:00.61]You just like laying flat down.
[107:02.27]That's weird.
[107:09.79]There's actually nothing.
[107:10.82]Was there another thing to pull over here?
[107:13.90]Where did we get it?
[107:20.55]Who knows?
[107:23.45]Who the hell is Balder?
[107:27.16]This guy doesn't know who Balder is.
[107:29.70]I mean, I know who Balder is in mythology, but who's Balder in the Balder's Gate sense?
[107:34.91]Is it Balder from Balder mythology?
[107:36.85]From Balder?
[107:37.97]Like the guy that can get beat up?
[107:41.35]You're talking about Balderon.
[107:48.78]Who's Balder?
[107:51.62]You're thinking of Balderon.
[107:56.57]It's the dude who founded Baldur's Gate.
[108:00.73]I think he was like a ship captain.
[108:04.54]Though not like Zeus' half-son or whatever.
[108:08.45]I mean, he might be at some point he has to like kill God, I guess.
[108:16.86]Like doesn't everybody?
[108:20.89]It's Odin, by the way.
[108:21.89]Yeah, whatever.
[108:28.98]Balder is Norse mythology, yeah.
[108:33.17]Dude, watch it.
[108:33.91]We've got green and blue shapes.
[108:38.06]That actually almost killed me instantly.
[108:52.88]Oh.
[108:57.03]There's a face on this door.
[108:59.84]We got to pull the other.
[109:01.82]It's definitely on the right side.
[109:02.88]It's creepy.
[109:04.84]It is.
[109:05.02]This game is kind of creepy.
[109:08.49]Cube.
[109:09.39]I like the noise these make.
[109:14.11]A fine staff.
[109:18.72]I feel kind of bad because I've spent a thousand gold on this axe and I think I'm probably about to replace it by something that drops on the ground.
[109:25.99]Oh, speaking of dropping things on the ground.
[109:33.70]Oops.
[109:34.06]Look at all these blueberries.
[109:35.39]I had a lot of those.
[109:40.15]Do you use mana for anything?
[109:42.03]Not at this point.
[109:43.35]We just need to... Let's just pull the lever and leave.
[109:46.12]Okay.
[109:51.10]I can't jump over them.
[110:00.29]We can kill them.
[110:01.01]They're chumps.
[110:15.15]We need the experience.
[110:16.33]I'm scared of them.
[110:17.37]I'm talking about we need to level up.
[110:19.88]Doesn't he get that?
[110:25.12]Alright, this is it now.
[110:26.20]We're about to fight a super human.
[110:33.88]What?
[110:35.20]This guy gets it.
[110:36.26]Oh, we're not in sync anymore.
[110:44.43]What's your favorite tabletop RPG spell?
[110:48.83]Color spray.
[110:51.18]Oh, that's a fucking lame, lame answer.
[110:55.16]I just think of somebody going... Like... And it sprays a rainbow color out of their mouth.
[111:03.64]Oh, yeah.
[111:04.48]He's just trying to pretend like he didn't pick it because it's meta.
[111:07.78]Is it actually meta?
[111:10.31]It isn't Pathfinder.
[111:10.93]Pathfinder.
[111:15.65]It's like pocket sand.
[111:16.55]Yeah, I see it as like fabulous pocket sand.
[111:21.91]That's why I like it.
[111:25.40]Why did you skip the cutscene?
[111:26.58]I didn't.
[111:27.94]What are you doing?
[111:29.32]I didn't mean to.
[111:29.95]I'm going to die.
[111:33.59]I'm dead.
[111:34.15]You got to go back up.
[111:35.57]I wasn't looking at the screen.
[111:40.88]What happened?
[111:41.56]I don't know.
[111:43.28]He was walking and then you killed us.
[111:47.42]Reload the save.
[111:48.72]Reload the save.
[111:49.95]It's right there.
[111:51.31]Yeah, true.
[111:52.31]True.
[111:52.97]Alright, don't skip the cutscene.
[111:54.59]Sorry, I mogged everyone.
[111:58.02]But mogging people.
[111:59.56]I mogged.
[112:01.36]Wait, you mogged.
[112:03.05]Alright, don't skip.
[112:05.19]It'd be funny if I did again though.
[112:07.17]I mean, kind of, but I don't think you should.
[112:12.32]It'd be even funnier if that was the whole cutscene.
[112:17.07]It could be.
[112:31.89]I love this guy.
[112:38.58]If your man fails to do this, then both of you shall answer for it.
[112:47.02]I love this voice actor.
[112:48.63]He's so good at everything.
[112:53.39]Very well.
[112:54.84]Bring me the prisoner you found in the sewers.
[112:57.92]The sewers.
[113:01.45]My lord, I sent for the prisoner some time ago, but I have received no word from the bugbears in the sewers.
[113:10.00]Send your men into the sewers.
[113:11.82]Find out what has happened to our soldiers and bring me the prisoner.
[113:16.61]Frollo?
[113:21.63]Was Tony J. Frollo?
[113:22.66]I think so.
[113:23.28]No.
[113:25.00]If he places the orb as instructed, he will not be coming back.
[113:31.65]Tell your men to avoid the temple grounds.
[113:35.58]To enter it now is certain death.
[113:43.22]Dude, what a great voice actor.
[113:45.44]Alright, these guys killed us last time.
[113:47.85]Careful.
[113:49.31]Yeah, us.
[113:52.25]We're sharing a screen, so it counts as both of us.
[114:03.82]Alright, let's go.
[114:05.38]Let's go.
[114:13.19]that's bad oh dude tearing it up there might be a safe point like right here he just wants to watch the cutscene again oh might have to see the cutscene again

[115:54.81]Blow down.
[115:56.23]Change is fine.
[116:03.84]I just realized I have this on three screens.
[116:13.17]I'm so cooked.
[116:16.30]What?
[116:16.52]You have the stream on three screens?
[116:19.70]Why do you have three?
[116:21.39]What do you mean?
[116:22.01]Tabs?
[116:24.10]iPad, TV and phone.
[116:25.95]You weren't supposed to see that.
[116:44.76]You are twitch.tv maximum.
[116:48.81]You're maxing out.
[116:51.93]You are twitch.tv maxing out.
[117:01.32]You bought chatter.
[117:04.79]Hey, three of those people, three of these people here are not three people.
[117:14.71]You've inflated my view count by three viewers.
[117:21.12]The hell, man.
[117:22.72]You trying to get me in trouble?
[117:25.64]Yeah, ban that guy for three seconds.
[117:27.43]One for each.
[117:27.91]Okay.
[117:31.53]We priests of ill matter set up some non-lethal traps here in the crypts to capture grave robbers.
[117:37.56]The trap that sealed off the exits is triggered by three urns on this level.
[117:41.88]When these urns are taken from their pedestals, stone blocks seal off all the exits from this level.
[117:47.61]I knocked all the urns from their pedestals and then barricaded myself in here.
[117:52.60]Do you trust this guy?
[117:57.36]Yeah.
[117:57.56]Carrying a purse?
[118:00.91]He's probably got medical supplies in there.
[118:10.58]I bet there's a human head in there.
[118:13.43]Maybe he's doing some kind of experiments to see to make us live longer.
[118:20.47]so yeah I don't know there's a human head in there so what you see this is Baldur's this is Baldur's Gate man that's what I put in my purse
[118:40.29]It hates all of us priests.
[118:42.69]Even they take the same Baldur's Gate presents Candyland.
[118:45.81]Dude, this is Baldur's Gate Doc Alliance from the dead to perform its will.
[118:51.56]Who's allied?
[118:52.50]Where does or this guy?
[118:57.68]This guy is overreacting.
[118:59.40]Delivering an urn to the lower.
[119:00.87]You think so?
[119:01.57]When I suddenly notice tracks on the floor, something's off as I am the only one who usually comes down here.
[119:08.01]I became curious and followed them.
[119:11.10]Getting scary.
[119:34.20]Alright, then... It's probably where you're still alive.
[119:37.11]Take the secret door to the sewers to get back to the streets.
[119:39.91]And tell the guards and priests what happened.
[119:43.35]Okay.
[119:44.25]Um... How many undead are in the crypts?
[119:58.29]Count them, all of them.
[119:59.11]Oh, you're a priest?
[120:01.06]Name every undead.
[120:02.74]Do you see his, like, necklace thing coming out under the robe?
[120:06.66]If you pull that, the light bulb turns on.
[120:08.81]200 zombies.
[120:10.71]This is messed up, dude.
[120:28.76]Where'd the orb come from?
[120:31.42]Okay.
[120:32.20]Where'd the tracks go?
[120:42.72]Alright, we're gonna go to the level below.
[120:56.04]Chamber of Ashes.
[120:59.13]chamber of ashes how do we reach the orb to reach the level below you must find the three urns on this level and place them back on the proper pedestals got it no my place is here I this guy's gonna be dead when we come back run from this if I can help you I will alright oh give us some healing of course let the power of ill matter comfort you and restore your strength
[121:29.46]Hey.
[121:31.92]What did he say?
[121:32.54]I was that I was in this room.
[121:34.69]He said that there's an orb and this tracks that we have to follow and we have to pick up three urns.
[121:43.84]Clever ghost.
[121:47.12]Oh, I love like old era video game ghosts where you can see all of the ghost polygons.
[121:53.94]Yeah, you can see where they all connect.
[121:56.66]The ghost wireframe.
[121:58.79]Where's he going?
[122:00.53]He's a ghost.
[122:01.01]He's doing whatever he wants.
[122:02.79]Alright, here we go.
[122:14.16]I have no healing potions.
[122:20.03]Can we do a town run before we do the crypt?
[122:26.18]You should ask your new friend for healing.
[122:30.11]turn on damage numbers do you want damage numbers you want to say classic mode uh I'm a classic Andy excuse me I'm a classic Steven oh it's funny you can actually do this though like watch this
[122:51.99]So on the options menu, we have brightness, right?
[122:56.66]Which you've seen what that does.
[122:58.48]We have music, which we know what that is.
[122:59.84]Sound effects, right?
[123:00.58]For the clashing and the punching and the screaming.
[123:04.99]There's a resolution meter.
[123:07.51]And you're probably wondering, you're asking yourself, this doesn't say 1920 by 1080 or 4K.
[123:12.26]What is that?
[123:13.64]Yeah, what is it resolving?
[123:17.46]It just makes the game uglier.
[123:21.39]It's a slider bar to make it look like the way it used to.
[123:25.79]I mean, that is a lower resolution.
[123:27.90]Technically, I guess it is.
[123:29.06]It is a resolution smear bar.
[123:36.68]Your mic has too much low end.
[123:43.09]You're going to read that comment once every hour?
[123:45.63]Why am I reading that?
[123:47.83]It's going to mess with you.
[123:48.83]You wanted to do a town run.
[123:50.59]Oh, right.
[124:01.87]Chad is judging his mic like it's a guitar tone I kind of like it being a little crunchy do you I really didn't even notice what are they saying what they said you're they said my lows or two hold on what are they even talking about I didn't mess with my mic let's see
[124:23.39]I don't I don't even I don't.
[124:26.53]I'm trying to find my lows.
[124:27.91]My somebody said my lows.
[124:29.44]Let me tell me if it sounds better when I do this.
[124:31.82]OK, right?
[124:32.74]Yeah, how's this?
[124:34.60]How's that?
[124:36.59]The better like the same my lows better.
[124:39.45]We have many fine deals.
[124:43.15]How are we doing?
[124:44.11]Hey, how am I doing right now?
[124:45.94]You sound crazy.
[124:48.34]Well.
[124:50.84]Maybe I should just keep it this way.
[124:52.23]Worse, better, better, better, better.
[125:02.02]How's it going?
[125:02.48]We're doing good.
[125:04.76]Better.
[125:05.54]Speaking of high pitch.
[125:09.45]Don't listen to the audio perverts, OK?
[125:17.76]If you need something to split someone's skull or a helm to protect your own, you'll come to the right place.
[125:24.91]Do you have a plus one helmet on?
[125:26.05]Nope.
[125:30.48]They have the same defense.
[125:31.52]I don't know if it matters.
[125:32.38]I think it does something else too.
[125:36.32]It shouldn't.
[125:42.31]Okay, for a second I came back and I was like, why does the game look like shit?
[125:46.09]Oh, right, because I did that.
[125:52.56]I went down one and bought the ring of protection twice oh that's not good uh you want one I'll definitely I'll take it I would love one that sounds great to me I spam clicked to buy the potions I don't think I can drop them here oh that's a oh yeah you would lose 300 gold nice to sell it back hey thanks
[126:25.83]Let me change the prescription on your glasses real quick.
[126:33.02]Alright, we're good.
[126:35.32]I want to put that on.
[126:41.03]Okay.
[126:41.99]Yeah, everybody's been saying that I sound weird lately and I don't know why.
[126:45.32]I like that term.
[126:47.70]Audio pervert's a funny way to say that.
[127:04.31]let's kill some skeletons no they used to be people not anymore and there's ghouls alright man I'd rather fight 200 of these than like one galore this area seems easier
[127:34.24]I think we just better.
[127:40.85]We gotta find that guy's brother's body.
[127:51.57]It's up here.
[127:53.53]I usually snort.
[127:57.04]Yow scary.
[128:04.74]I'm dead.
[128:05.28]Ouch.
[128:10.69]Did you do a forward cruller?
[128:13.21]We just did the town run, dude.
[128:16.32]You already out of potions?
[128:18.10]No, you died, so you must have been... It's just spike damage, man.
[128:24.25]Gotta deal with that burst.
[128:35.13]I was cursed!
[128:36.19]I don't know what it is!
[128:37.23]You are sneezing a lot.
[128:38.33]You gotta do some dustin'.
[128:44.58]Honestly, that sounded like the sound effect of somebody getting their, like, throat cut in, like, a game.
[128:51.56]That's the sound that happens when you're a solid snake and you're behind somebody and it's like...
[129:01.98]that was a horror movie you just the monster was behind you like Jason was behind you and just grabbed you and just it just severed your head from your shoulders that's a weird fantasy I'm dead again should I just keep playing solo no I'll live I feel like I should clear this room for you clear this room
[129:41.95]thanks dude if you need something to split someone's skull or help protect your skull yeah man you're gonna want you're gonna want to watch out this game's pretty hard now imagine doing this by yourself and and playing melee and dying at that spot 40 times
[130:14.03]The regen's pretty good, though.
[130:23.45]Dude, I cut his arm off.
[130:26.43]Nice.
[130:27.33]You know when they were making that, they were like, dude, this is wicked fucked up.
[130:32.72]I would imagine.
[130:33.34]They probably were like, dude, this is so fucked up what we're doing.
[130:39.37]Dude, his head popped off.
[130:43.03]This head came off.
[130:44.69]He's just wandering around because he has no body parts.
[130:49.01]Dude, animating that and putting, you know, doing frame by frame and his head come off.
[130:52.93]Like, that is... Man, they must... They had to have thought this was fucked up.
[130:57.76]What, like, twisted mind came up with that?
[131:01.78]By the way, skeletons?
[131:03.80]These are human bodies that have had the muscle tissue and the blood.
[131:09.23]They're literally a skeleton.
[131:11.03]A human skeleton.
[131:12.01]That's disgusting.
[131:14.04]Walking around?
[131:14.92]This should be buried.
[131:16.21]This is disgraceful.
[131:17.41]These ghosts are human skeletons without even the skeleton.
[131:20.47]This is disgraceful.
[131:22.26]It's truly nothing.
[131:23.74]It's disgusting.
[131:30.75]Wait, there's another save below us.
[131:32.72]Is there?
[131:43.67]These guys hit like a truck, honestly.
[131:46.98]Oh lagging.
[131:48.64]Are you good?
[131:49.52]Oh yeah.
[131:57.08]I think I died.
[132:03.47]Dude, just go just go crazy.
[132:05.49]I am.
[132:17.44]This room was full of them.
[132:22.71]I haven't seen you dodge roll one time.
[132:26.07]This is back before it was in every game.
[132:32.22]Somebody at some point said, hey, B should be just dive with iframes on it.
[132:39.39]And then every single developer said, yeah.
[132:44.22]Yeah, I think that sounds good.
[132:56.81]Oh, Josh, did you just call it Roll Slop?
[133:02.04]Ah, that's before everything became Roll Slop.
[133:06.78]Yeah, from Slopware.
[133:22.34]Blah!
[133:23.30]Blah!
[133:25.63]This game is a real potion like.
[133:43.25]Hey, just bring me back.
[133:44.19]It's right there.
[133:47.07]Thank you.
[133:51.76]This is a potion like.
[133:56.41]You need a lot of them.
[134:10.51]Dude, once I get a big spell, they're going to regret talking bad about me.
[134:17.76]I believe it.
[134:19.92]You're saving after every swing?
[134:21.59]Gotta be sure.
[134:29.07]I don't like that you can do that and I'm the host.
[134:31.75]It's my game.
[134:32.99]We're in my world and you can do that.
[134:46.34]What was that one game you were playing the other day?
[134:47.85]I saw you being a save-slopper.
[134:51.09]Yeah.
[134:51.21]You played the game for like 20 seconds.
[134:52.93]No, like two.
[134:53.81]Like every two seconds it was, oh, I better save.
[134:57.21]what game was this bioforge I don't know no you were a guy with a sword third person sword oh you're fighting like a lizards die by the sword that game is insanely hard too that's another that's a save that's a safe slop game
[135:27.86]I'm out of potions.
[135:40.63]These guys aren't really dropping anything.
[135:42.84]These guys aren't dropping like anything.
[135:51.39]I need another town run.
[135:53.98]Do you or do... I could use one.
[135:57.34]I don't need one.
[135:58.20]Not quite.
[136:01.13]I'm too powerful.
[136:11.88]Yup.
[136:13.42]Yup.
[136:14.60]You are in a certain mood tonight.
[136:20.23]I've never heard a yuck out of you.
[136:23.60]You don't usually do a hyuk.
[136:27.40]What does that mean?
[136:28.98]Dude, to the one guy in chat that plus-tued that, there's only one person that did.
[136:33.03]Nobody else even wrote anything.
[136:36.25]That's bull- Oh!
[136:38.54]That's bullshit because whenever I do the a hyuk hyuk, I get like, duh, stop, dude.
[136:43.02]I'm cringing.
[136:43.69]Don't do that.
[136:45.61]Everybody hates it when I do it.
[136:46.59]One guy thought that was funny.
[136:47.51]Everybody else was completely indifferent.
[136:51.17]Maybe I've just got more cred than you.
[136:53.17]That's ridiculous.
[136:56.22]I was just doing it because I was thinking of Vinny talking about him with the Keyblade and Sephiroth the other day.
[137:06.41]Gorge.
[137:10.69]I cannot go in this room, man.
[137:13.86]We can't do this room.
[137:19.12]Oh, another zombie slop room.
[137:22.05]What are these goats?
[137:26.76]Here.
[137:27.80]Run it back.
[137:28.80]Run it back.
[137:31.70]You have infinite life.
[137:35.63]Well, relatively.
[137:44.52]I don't think I could actually go in that room unless you were here.
[137:51.69]Okay.
[137:56.29]I can't... Um, why don't you do it?
[138:01.18]You try.
[138:01.68]I didn't even light him on fire.
[138:22.54]Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[138:27.04]I've hit one skeleton like 40 times.
[138:30.10]I'm sorry.
[138:30.44]I can't hear you.
[138:31.23]I'm over the washing machine.
[138:32.33]I cannot hear anything you're saying.
[138:48.56]Okay.
[138:52.05]how are you supposed to like seriously how the you supposed to do this like how are you supposed to do this I don't have a third one I don't understand no like somebody explain it to me somebody explain what I'm supposed to do about this uh town run I'm out of potions
[139:19.70]I thought this is the chill zone.
[139:20.99]It is.
[139:21.47]Can you dodge roll once?
[139:25.05]Need to show you stuff.
[139:28.82]I think the smell of the sewers has taken a liking to you.
[139:33.28]You come up here and these people act like they know you.
[139:35.30]What are you looking for?
[139:44.58]Just buying potions.
[139:45.90]That's all I'm good for.
[139:50.55]maybe maybe I should use a bow somebody's saying use a bow I should yeah okay good loading why does the coin icon look so edible kind of true what should I what if we just ran through the room and didn't do it uh okay
[140:20.34]We need these urns.
[140:22.84]Yep, this is the urn puzzle.
[140:34.37]I just called it a puzzle and it's just put the three urns in the squares.
[140:37.35]That's not a puzzle.
[140:46.98]You didn't pick up the fucking ring.
[140:49.54]Forget it.
[140:50.09]We can share it.
[140:57.35]Did Star ever tell him what to eat?
[141:04.58]No, he didn't.
[141:05.74]Bad friend.
[141:07.69]I told you just to learn how to cook rice.
[141:10.67]Yeah, but that's okay.
[141:11.91]I'm going to eat rice.
[141:13.31]Just rice for dinner.
[141:16.80]What else?
[141:17.50]What do you like that goes with rice?
[141:19.88]Broccoli.
[141:21.67]Chicken tiki masala from Trader Joe's.
[141:24.05]I like, uh... I think a teriyaki chicken would go pretty hard on rice with some broccoli.
[141:30.20]That sounds kind of good.
[141:30.92]Maybe I'll make that.
[141:43.77]I don't understand this.
[141:45.15]This puzzle is, like, too hard.
[141:47.36]So what?
[141:47.88]It doesn't go... The gray one can't go on the left one?
[141:50.41]So where does it go then?
[142:01.38]I don't... I don't understand.
[142:03.00]I don't get why that worked.
[142:08.75]Oh, town run?
[142:09.39]I don't think... I don't think anyone knows.
[142:11.22]Oh, town run.
[142:22.78]uh I have to drop some stuff for you ouch when do we get like a machine gun here funnel all the cool stuff to the caster you say that like there are caster weapons in this game there are not
[142:55.99]You funnel to the tank first.
[143:00.42]Which is also you.
[143:17.48]We need to get you a lifesteal weapon.
[143:21.78]I just need more regen.
[143:27.40]The sanguine cleaver of the vamp.
[143:34.98]Legends have been told of this fine axe.
[143:39.17]That sounded like you.
[143:42.27]I was like, what?
[143:43.05]They haven't made that noise before.
[143:44.43]I did just make that noise.
[143:47.30]It was me.
[143:54.41]Oh God, good noise.
[143:55.57]Oh, let's stand this corner.
[143:56.59]Stand in the bottom corner.
[143:59.46]They can't all hit us.
[144:02.70]Actually kind of a good idea.
[144:15.17]Corner strats.
[144:22.02]Whoa, I died quickly.
[144:26.51]I think that was an elite.
[144:28.69]Hey Jerma thinking about starting karaoke this week.
[144:30.53]Any song recommendations?
[144:33.23]Yeah, walking in Memphis.
[144:35.56]What is love walking in Memphis?
[144:38.52]Walk with my feet 10 feet over here.
[144:40.96]You can get some cheers for that one.
[144:45.39]Where was the save?
[144:48.45]Is it all the way upstairs?
[144:49.77]Oh no, right there.
[144:54.25]There's nobody going to cheer for that.
[144:57.52]Walking in Memphis.
[145:01.77]What if their friends are under 30?
[145:04.86]Then that'll look like the Chug Chug song.
[145:07.42]Uh, Gundam style.
[145:10.15]Hey, Chuggy Wadey.
[145:15.36]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[145:20.15]Oh.
[145:26.14]Ow.
[145:27.05]I need more armor.
[145:28.01]Bad.
[145:28.67]That's what I'm buying.
[145:29.67]I'm just buying it.
[145:31.31]I take way too much damage.
[145:32.95]Way too much damage.
[145:39.02]You keep picking up the fucking mana potions.
[145:42.19]You have no self-control.
[145:47.50]I pick them up to put them down.
[145:51.54]Now that's called working out.
[145:54.19]Now that's a deadlift right there.
[145:56.86]Jerma's getting yoked.
[145:58.88]25 kills on the board right now.
[146:08.96]Agate, that's a remix.
[146:20.16]I don't want to be changed to the walking undead no my place is here I'll help stays in that room forever don't die don't die don't die don't die I died I gotta tell you this would be going quicker if I didn't have to keep walking back for your body
[146:50.38]Hey, give me a song that you like and I'll ruin it.
[146:55.85]Gundam style.
[147:09.45]Sounds like you are trying to take a drink out of a straw, but it's empty.
[147:17.68]Cool.
[147:18.48]That sounds pretty true.
[147:20.69]and like you won't stop give me give me another one um kill him am I am I just supposed to know a name of another song well you're going to for the Monster Rancher 2 tournament which I'm announcing right now the Monster Rancher 2 tournament it's going to be starring Ster

[147:49.65]Vinny.
[147:50.93]Poke.
[147:53.00]Etalyx.
[147:55.72]And those are the people that said that, hey, I'll do it, like, three months ago when I asked them.
[148:02.95]And Criken.
[148:09.18]Oh my god, I take so much damage.
[148:11.30]They hit me once and I'm dead.
[148:12.42]Walk forward, don't walk backwards.
[148:14.76]There's probably a save point right here.
[148:17.27]Horn him in, Andy.
[148:19.62]Oh, shit.
[148:20.38]I thought you killed him.
[148:22.18]Right trigger.
[148:25.68]Get it off the screen.
[148:26.63]Take it off the screen.
[148:30.75]This is not good, dude.
[148:33.25]Corner strat.
[148:34.12]Corner strat.
[148:34.86]I can't even get to the corner.
[148:36.60]Oh, you are fucking dead, man.
[148:38.08]We haven't saved.
[148:46.84]It's lagging.
[148:47.68]I can't see what's happening.
[148:49.46]What?
[148:50.22]You're good.
[148:50.68]You're good.
[148:50.96]You're fine.
[148:52.81]Just keep aiming that direction and you'll kill them all.
[149:01.18]OK is 5 or 6 left.
[149:05.75]Look at your experience bar.
[149:07.05]This is so unfair.
[149:14.11]And that's how you play the game.
[149:17.28]I'm already dead.
[149:26.36]I spawned.
[149:27.48]I spawned with one health.
[149:29.62]Just go get them.
[149:32.35]What do you have to lose?
[149:33.03]Are they infinitely respawning?
[149:34.37]They're just like still getting out of the ground.
[149:36.14]Are the urns we have to break?
[149:38.16]Oh, that was a crazy weapon I picked up.
[149:41.02]Did you get something good?
[149:42.90]Come to the corner.
[149:44.05]I'm just letting the regen help me.
[149:52.38]Good luck.
[149:53.26]Good luck getting all the experience.
[149:54.74]You're going to get to like level 10 before I see the fucking light of day.
[150:00.75]You didn't get Dwarven Rush?
[150:04.74]I don't... I don't know what iPad game you're installing, okay?
[150:07.66]Are you kidding me?
[150:11.21]This guy doesn't have Dwarven Rush?
[150:19.04]I'm just doing this so my little brother can play.
[150:24.10]Dormammu!
[150:25.90]I've come to bargain.
[150:27.31]Hey, Dormammu!
[150:30.84]I'm here to bargain.
[150:41.69]Don't save it when I'm about to die.
[150:44.59]I tried to pick up the potion and it was the same button.
[150:47.70]Hey, Dormammu!
[150:56.85]Alright, what weapon did you get that was amazing apparently?
[151:00.83]I saw a plus one mace of disruption.
[151:04.19]Oh, damn.
[151:04.65]9 to 13.
[151:06.95]You into this?
[151:08.27]I mean, I think that's a one-handed weapon.
[151:11.58]Yeah, I dropped it here.
[151:13.24]I mean, I'm totally into that.
[151:17.10]4 to 12.
[151:17.40]9 to 13 and it's a one-hander?
[151:22.61]That means I can be shield guy.
[151:25.05]I might have another shitty shield for you.
[151:27.07]I'll take it.
[151:30.98]No.
[151:32.24]Eh, one will drop on the ground.
[151:33.23]It's fine.
[151:33.85]Let's go back to town.
[151:37.71]You have no potions.
[151:39.11]It's fine.
[151:40.91]I can't just Dormammu you forever.
[151:43.02]Yeah, you can.
[151:45.58]Okay.
[151:47.38]Oh, he was disrupted.
[151:48.56]This thing is a magical disrupting mace.
[151:50.59]That's why it's better.
[151:56.81]Definitely anti-undead.
[152:08.12]Okay, this thing slays.
[152:20.33]Dude, that feeling you get when you play an ARPG and you get that upgrade, that thing that just clicks.
[152:28.44]With Adam Sandler?
[152:40.96]alright so what's what's your assessment of this fun little game you like it um I don't like that you level up one time every two hours that's fair
[152:58.88]It's alright, though.
[152:59.76]I like these like, you know, I'm an action RPG Andy.
[153:04.01]My chat, your chat keeps telling me like they like it when you say Andy.
[153:08.58]Because I'm trying to incorporate it more.
[153:10.00]No, your chat.
[153:11.18]Well, that's not true.
[153:12.16]I misspoke.
[153:13.28]Your chat is my chat.
[153:14.50]My chat hates it.
[153:16.99]But I like it when I do it.
[153:18.71]Not when you do it.
[153:19.63]I see.
[153:19.93]Because every time I do it, somebody goes, dude, stop doing that.
[153:32.67]I just, uh, shield just dropped.

[154:08.73]The noble born peasant.

[154:20.61]You don't want him?
[154:28.05]Don't speak that into existence.
[154:33.46]This looks to be a... Uh-oh.
[154:36.60]Boss orb of the undead.

[156:42.58]I could buy one.
[156:47.81]Oh, friend.
[156:51.47]Oh, yes.
[156:52.29]Oh, welcome to the tavern.

[161:50.41]Come on!
[161:55.23]I hunger for action.
[162:33.29]Is there something about this area you wanted me to see?
[163:10.92]Come on!
[163:12.17]I hunger for action.
[164:02.36]Come on, I hunger for action.
[164:35.01]Oh, my God.
[165:01.59]Our foes are gathering strength while we wait here.
[165:04.62]Let's move on.
[165:29.47]Come on, I hunger for action.
[166:02.37]I have returned.
[166:05.38]Otto had to poop.
[166:08.58]An extra few minutes.
[166:14.83]Stuart doesn't even know I'm back yet.
[166:20.96]Stuart doesn't even know I'm here.
[166:27.85]Hello, I am back.
[166:29.31]Otto had to poop.
[166:31.05]So sorry about that.
[166:34.81]Hey, everybody gets one.
[166:39.73]We are hungry for action.
[166:42.70]Do you think we can kill this guy in the first try here?
[166:47.76]Maybe like six.
[166:50.22]It didn't look like we were doing that much damage to it.
[166:52.61]100.
[166:54.31]Welcome back.
[166:55.77]Something I can get for you.
[166:57.53]How's Ethan doing?
[166:58.49]He's doing well.
[167:00.01]He's been talking about you quite a bit.
[167:02.20]He's impressed with your skill.
[167:04.30]oh she's talking to me you're the one you're in control no she's oh uh bye then you're in total control of this entire thing no not true not true not true it's you does this guy say anything yet we probably have to beat the boss I would imagine
[167:36.16]Anybody just running like a forklift.
[167:43.72]I'm not in control.
[167:44.52]You're in control.
[167:46.80]I'm in control of this scenario.
[167:49.91]OK, we can.
[167:51.27]Oh, that's right.
[167:51.95]I have to recall.
[167:54.01]We got potions.
[167:54.95]We good.
[167:55.49]Wait.
[167:56.58]Why does recall not work?
[167:57.74]OK.
[168:01.56]Corner strats.
[168:02.89]Corner strat.
[168:06.22]Sounds good to me.
[168:11.97]Mad DPS on the orb.
[168:17.87]Alright out bottom left corner.
[168:23.42]You get scared, you can just hold your shield.
[168:28.12]Oh, that's a good idea, because then you can.
[168:32.77]Burn them.
[168:33.83]Oh wrong button.
[168:35.23]I forgot how to play.
[168:38.45]This is the lamest way to fight a boss.
[168:42.56]This is called teamwork, bro.
[168:48.83]I got hit.
[168:52.51]I'm hit.
[168:54.71]Took damage.
[168:55.63]Oh, you're it?
[169:04.59]Oh, there's one more guy over here.
[169:08.18]He killed one at swing.
[169:10.73]What the hell?
[169:12.49]That was actually crazy.
[169:21.96]Beware the orb.
[169:23.20]Are we going to corner strat again?
[169:24.64]I think we have to.
[169:25.40]These guys are crazy.
[169:29.79]Seems very difficult.
[169:34.81]It is.
[169:35.69]What I tell you, this game's no joke.
[169:41.85]Are you gonna leave room behind you for me?
[169:46.92]How am I gonna fight them?
[169:53.30]You're taking a lot of damage.
[169:54.83]I know, I'm telling you.
[169:55.69]It's like x5 damage.
[169:56.13]I don't even think I'm taking that much.
[170:02.51]We got this.
[170:17.56]That would be good.
[170:22.62]Alright, you complained about how I set up over here?
[170:25.41]Yeah, I need to be able to get behind you.
[170:32.55]I'm good.
[170:38.48]That didn't work as well.
[170:44.65]I love energy.
[170:48.59]This almost almost sounds like Christmas music.
[170:55.36]I can see it.
[171:03.33]Like a scene in home alone when he's running away from the from like Marvin.
[171:11.25]There's definitely a home alone chase scene music here, right?
[171:16.00]Shit.
[171:16.84]Damn, we did it so good the first time.
[171:19.14]We did.
[171:19.56]I'm gonna kill that kid!
[171:28.40]Oh, no!
[171:30.97]Get over here, you little bastard!
[171:32.51]Whatever they say.
[171:33.53]And he's getting pulled on a sleigh by a couple dogs.
[171:36.84]And this is the sleigh music.
[171:45.26]I don't know.
[171:45.98]Are we doing it?
[171:46.56]We keep dying.
[171:47.28]Alright.
[171:48.24]Well, let's just do it, but I'm going to stand right here.
[171:54.83]One got behind.
[172:03.08]The formation has been broken.
[172:04.20]Formation broken.
[172:04.93]Run.
[172:11.01]I'm lighting the campfire.
[172:22.08]Oh my goodness, it hurts.
[172:34.51]Dude, hold it.
[172:35.23]This is fucking crazy.
[172:37.15]It's crazy.
[172:38.15]We have to do like 10 waves of this.
[172:40.19]We have to do a lot.
[172:41.30]This is going to be insane.
[172:42.44]I think we just have to actually just be good and just not get hit.
[172:54.38]It's Cod Zombies.
[172:55.86]That's funny.
[172:56.60]It actually is.
[172:59.40]Yeah, play this like Cod Zombies.
[173:00.78]Don't play it like an RPG.
[173:04.37]Okay, give me the AK.
[173:12.64]Whoa, you won, Captain.
[173:14.38]I think I hurt him.
[173:17.33]Yeah, we have to play just like total cowards and just don't try not to get hit.
[173:21.27]It's going to take forever, but whatever.
[173:22.47]We're going to do it.
[173:42.93]Oh my God.
[173:57.02]Oh, you almost died.
[174:09.42]I just, I just, I don't see how this is sustainable.
[174:12.93]It's not.
[174:13.91]We just have to do it.
[174:17.03]I mean, they drop potions sometimes.
[174:20.94]Alright, get ready.
[174:24.37]DPS.
[174:25.57]On the orb.
[174:57.29]Dude, if only we could slam dunk that orb.
[175:00.46]My eye's itching.
[175:01.22]We could just jump a little higher.
[175:02.68]Oh, you fucking... What did you do?
[175:05.68]I thought I... We were doing a pattern.
[175:07.44]I thought you were going the other way, so I was going up with you and I got stuck.
[175:10.69]My eye's fucked up.
[175:13.33]I'll kill it.
[175:14.35]I'll do it.
[175:23.66]I don't think you're gonna do it.
[175:25.85]yeah dude you need to equip like a bow oh my god this is fucked up we had it it's just my eye just started itching for no reason alright this is the one
[176:15.32]This is going better.
[176:21.59]They do drop a lot.
[176:27.82]Orb coming down.
[176:30.46]Dude, this is to earn... Why did they die so fast that time, actually?
[176:34.97]I don't know.
[176:36.09]Maybe we got Luigi'd.
[176:40.50]What?
[176:41.56]We might have gotten Luigi'd.
[176:43.57]I don't know what that means.
[176:44.27]The game just made itself easier.
[176:47.68]I was like, shot in New York?
[176:49.30]Like, what?
[176:50.00]No, I'm talking about like Luigi from Super Mario.
[176:53.47]Don't break the formation.
[176:55.03]We had a thing going.
[177:14.08]Got a little greedy there, I saw.
[177:20.91]Oh, look at you!
[177:21.59]I did.
[177:23.42]I did immediately after yelling at you.
[177:52.98]I believe.
[177:53.96]This shit's at 50% health, man.
[177:56.74]I have like two potions left.
[177:58.01]I believe.
[178:09.70]I'm out of potions.
[178:23.49]this fucking Christmas music on a loop
[178:56.89]what the fuck I didn't get hit you're getting them just like four more waves of this that's true I probably should just die
[179:23.90]Are we?
[179:24.34]Yeah, are we under leveled?
[179:26.63]I don't know.
[179:28.85]I mean, we've killed every room up till now.
[179:31.25]I think it's just really.
[179:32.35]I think this is just like a shitty part of the game.
[179:36.86]Just proc your disrupt every time first hit.
[179:39.30]Yeah, what the hell was that?
[179:40.40]This thing was crazy the first wave.
[179:54.80]Hardest fight in the game, in my opinion.
[179:59.47]I could see that.
[180:01.94]I'm coming.
[180:04.06]I think this is the anti-piracy boss?
[180:06.06]No, this is... We need... Is maximum DPS on the orb?
[180:13.22]Oh, uh...
[180:28.38]I'm already fucking dead.
[180:30.00]I got trapped in the middle.
[180:36.35]How did I live longer than you?
[180:37.59]New strategy.
[180:38.89]How did I live?
[180:40.93]We're gonna get into the corner.
[180:43.18]I'm gonna block.
[180:44.32]Get behind me.
[180:44.82]We're gonna try to get it perfect.
[180:52.16]You stuff into the corner and I'll try to get right in front of you and just block everything.
[181:02.11]I'm dead.
[181:13.83]Why am I not blocking?
[181:16.90]Honestly, this is just better.
[181:18.04]It doesn't matter if I'm getting hurt.
[181:19.34]Okay, never mind.
[181:23.95]I'm still not going to... I just won't have enough mana potions to do that.
[181:32.17]The hit and run is more effective.
[181:35.45]Yeah.
[181:38.18]I think there's a delay between like the fire ticks.
[181:52.56]I wish we could mark people.
[181:55.78]Actually, OK, you know what?
[181:56.74]Let's do it.
[181:57.40]Let's do some call outs.
[181:59.41]okay alright because I think we do damage to the same one we have a better chance alright bald skeleton on the bottom I mean I'm really just shooting who's available I don't know if the call outs are gonna help
[182:26.78]when enough of them are dead you can wedge in here and block no like in the actual corner hey it's working you see what I'm saying though it's right here because then they'll never get behind you oh could I do so let's try that but not when they're all up because then they're just going to surround you
[182:59.24]that scared the shit out of me I thought something was going on in the game oh that actually might be better I don't know but actually like I don't know but magic missiles shouldn't have aoe
[183:28.62]Oh my god.
[183:33.73]Reddit says use Morningstar of Disruption or some disruption spell.
[183:37.71]That's what I got on.
[183:38.77]It's not killing them instantly.
[183:43.96]I mean, I haven't had the opportunity to learn a spell.
[183:47.90]Maybe we need to level one more time because we're kind of close and then maybe I could.
[183:51.51]Yeah, I have this thing.
[183:52.67]This is apparently supposed to be killing them instantly.
[183:59.37]You want to level up?
[184:01.29]Let's go.
[184:02.27]Come this way.
[184:07.10]I mean... It's going to take like an hour to get to this level.
[184:13.25]It might actually take a while.
[184:14.23]The way it's been.
[184:15.78]We can do it.
[184:16.90]Nothing seems to respawn in this game.
[184:18.80]Let's just gamer up.
[184:20.06]I think we're just going to run out of enemies.
[184:21.95]We have to gamer up.
[184:28.73]How come it's not these like shitty enemies?
[184:30.95]It's all like armored skeletons.
[184:33.84]Boss man.
[184:35.70]And I think we just genuinely have to go back to town and just buy like 40 potions.
[184:42.50]Just have a stack.
[184:46.97]Okay, that's all the enemies.
[184:55.46]There's another section over here.
[185:03.53]Nothing.
[185:05.01]Had to use one potion.
[185:07.01]Oh great.
[185:14.32]Why doesn't Mortimer help us?
[185:18.31]Yeah, what's his problem?
[185:21.90]He said he would.
[185:30.26]If you could just cast Desecrate one time.
[185:34.07]Consecrate something.
[185:35.89]Paladin something.
[185:38.80]That one of those goofy spells?
[185:40.71]When I picked Sorceress, I thought I'd have more than one spell.
[185:45.88]He hates the game.
[185:49.85]I like the game, but it needs work.
[185:52.83]It's still early access, so maybe we'll get some updates soon.
[185:55.74]It's been early access for 27 years, so... I heard that patch 0.43b was coming up soon.
[186:07.79]Oh, I love 2b.
[186:16.69]Okay.
[186:21.31]I mean, up until now, every single room, our strategy has been let you die as many times as possible.
[186:27.34]And we just can't do that anymore.
[186:28.96]No.
[186:31.00]Welcome to the real game.
[186:36.01]He one hit me.
[186:39.08]He put his arms out and he said, yeah, say that joke again.
[186:41.94]I'll get you.
[186:46.05]And then I planked.
[186:49.47]There's nothing else in this room anyways.
[186:50.71]Let me just clear it.
[186:54.03]Well, we could go back to town and just put our whole life savings into potions.
[186:59.02]I don't have much.
[187:01.76]You might.
[187:06.19]Hey, it's okay to admit that your childhood game sucks.
[187:13.25]There's another spot we didn't do.
[187:17.75]I don't think Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance sucks.
[187:22.80]Here, I got a bunch of shit for you.
[187:25.02]I think we're just not good enough.
[187:27.10]We're just not good enough at the game.
[187:28.18]We gotta get better.
[187:34.49]You missed the amulet for that dude in town.
[187:36.29]Find it and he can give you XP to level.
[187:41.08]Oh, we didn't get the amulet.
[187:42.76]The brother.
[187:44.60]That might actually help.
[187:46.96]Brotherhood?
[187:50.24]Okay, I don't know where these things are.
[187:52.04]I don't know.
[187:52.92]Apparently we gotta find his bones or something.
[187:54.64]Maybe we didn't.
[187:55.52]Let's see.
[187:57.11]There's a couple places we didn't go.
[188:02.27]I'll avenge you.
[188:05.20]We didn't go down here.
[188:12.72]We gave the wine.
[188:13.37]Yeah, we gave it before.
[188:26.96]One more level and we will absolutely do it.
[188:33.77]Pick up everything you can to sell a town.
[188:45.62]And then just spam potions and we'll get it.
[188:51.15]OK.
[189:05.43]Burning hands, burning hands, burning hands.
[189:12.20]Sword hand.
[189:14.76]A lot of potions just dropped.
[189:16.03]That was pretty sick.
[189:29.35]We're leveling.
[189:30.73]We're getting there.
[189:38.47]Yeah, maybe.
[189:43.00]Surely with an ancient talisman.
[189:54.04]So was it up?
[189:55.00]Was it up here?
[189:57.18]The guy said the crypts, right?
[189:58.16]Did we just not see it on the ground or something?
[190:03.83]I don't know.
[190:06.91]Does he know?
[190:07.59]I don't.
[190:11.45]Did I?
[190:19.26]Yeah, does this go up?
[190:23.20]Crip level one.
[190:23.97]Did we just miss it up here?
[190:25.15]I guess we must have missed it.
[190:28.09]Hey, did you promise to make us your quote unquote world famous steak sandwich five years ago?
[190:33.78]I already did.
[190:35.02]I ate it on stream.
[190:37.13]that's the town yeah it's definitely down here it's like yeah we did one of these areas we didn't explore we'll level up look we got plenty of content to do we got plenty of levels to get down here we were under leveled for the boss
[191:06.91]Yeah, I need a respect potion.
[191:13.64]Get rid of magic missile.
[191:32.08]Is this gonna be a series?
[191:34.20]Just like Oblivion was a series?
[191:38.27]Don't say that.
[191:42.89]Dude, that's wicked fucked up.
[191:45.92]You just let them talk to you like that?
[191:49.94]How much Oblivion did you play?
[191:51.63]Once?
[191:53.01]I think twice, three times.
[191:58.84]I always say I want to play oblivion and I say let's go I want to play oblivion and then I just see how expansive and how crazy everything is and then I don't play it again here it is oh that's the king's amulet speaking of oblivion alright we're definitely gonna level up from this but let's clear it anyways should play fallout I
[192:25.91]what fallout besides new Vegas do people even like uh fallout 4 is good remember like fallout 2 people loved it I like fallout 2 as well fallout 2 is the one to play right if you're gonna play a fallout game if you if you want in like top down it's very different than the current ones I I beat it like eight times as a child as a youngin it's a good game
[193:05.33]Alright, let's go back to town.
[193:06.53]This probably will level us up.
[193:15.99]There was a ladder up to town.
[193:17.83]Oh in the other room.
[193:20.20]Alright, who is this?
[193:20.88]This guy?
[193:22.88]It's good to see you again.
[193:24.54]Yes.

[193:56.14]Oh, we get a stat increase.
[194:00.70]That's a big deal.
[194:02.97]More?
[194:04.05]Yeah, you missed a space there, game.
[194:14.00]I'm putting mine in charisma because it's going to be funny that I get... Intelligence is just mana?
[194:19.61]I don't know what arcane energy is.
[194:23.34]arcane energy I'd assume that's mana bonus is plus one for each two stats yeah you want to put it if they're doing it that way you want it on an even on an odd to make it even yeah dude I don't know none of these sound helpful
[194:51.42]right now I still can't get another spell you have three points now the next level you're gonna have four I want to get rid of magic missile because then I would have four and I would just melt it up or something right now you would you would but you can't how are you supposed to get to the point where these cost 22 because we have been playing for hours and we've leveled like twice
[195:11.03]how big is this game when you level up this game is like 11 hours by the way um when you level up you're gonna get four points then five points then six points then seven points each level you get more a plus one two points oh you're going burning hands star what are you doing it's the only thing I can do
[195:47.90]I have a move now and apparently it deals tremendous damage our shop carries the finest dwarven weapons brought here all the way oh damn actually better than what I have on I have another disruption mace
[196:18.71]I think you just got it oh you should use it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah if quality and price are your chief concerns then look no farther you'll find my shop has excellent weapons

[197:42.44]No.
[197:43.92]I have a million potions.
[197:47.59]There are no enemies here.
[197:50.47]There are no enemies here.
[197:52.18]You ready?
[197:53.98]We don't need to recall.
[197:55.42]Okay.

[198:35.48]Yeah, I gotta put on my... Put your mace on.
[198:39.17]Alright.
[198:41.62]Let's kill this thing.
[198:51.34]Okay.
[199:00.01]every single one let's just save it just in case we whatever there could be a freak accident why are these on the ground that's like 100 gold someone needs to clean this place up why is that on the ground that's 100 gold
[199:30.23]But you better save.
[199:33.57]Thanks true.
[199:41.11]Do I just?
[199:41.65]I want to.
[199:42.25]I just got the urge to go play that airplane level in Tony Hawk right now.
[199:48.52]Do you?
[199:49.20]Do you know how to use your ability you got?
[199:54.09]Yep, whoa, whoa, that might actually help us right now.
[200:03.76]okay I can't hurt the orb with that I don't think we got a bunch of them this is a bad start man
[200:41.14]I can't tell if that's a good thing or a bad thing where I'm going.
[200:46.06]I'm supposed to do a tremendous amount of damage.
[200:47.67]It doesn't seem tremendous.
[200:57.30]Be careful!
[200:58.72]Be careful!
[201:01.68]I'm worried about you!
[201:02.56]I'm okay.
[201:08.90]no no no no no that bull rush isn't doing tremendous damage oh yeah okay bull rush is not working well
[201:48.18]It's too much of a hit delay after I get hit by everything.
[201:58.97]If they bunch up like that, you just stand there and block and I'll burn him.
[202:03.28]If it ever comes up.
[202:15.45]I guess it like kind of.
[202:17.15]It kind of works a little.
[202:21.27]It makes them stop running.
[202:34.26]Dude's running!
[202:38.43]Honestly, if one of us gets aggro, the other one can just hit them from behind.
[202:41.23]Maybe that's what we should be doing.
[202:51.51]you try try to get aggro this time try to get them all I don't think we can really choose who has what they're kind of like going after you who left this gold on the ground
[203:20.94]We're fighting.
[203:28.65]Just be patient.
[203:29.66]We got this one.
[203:31.86]I agree.
[203:47.12]I was like, where'd you go?
[203:57.06]Alright, get ready.
[204:19.81]DPS.
[204:20.69]He's like a Macaulay Culkin.
[204:57.60]Just five more should do it in two more
[205:33.34]I didn't die yeah I've seen your disruption mace proc like one time oh that was scary my mana ran out and so it just made me go forward
[205:54.83]I may need you to drop your mana potions soon.
[205:56.91]I'm probably running in low.
[205:59.89]I will.
[206:03.04]Cart, grab this guy over here.
[206:10.01]Okay, paused.
[206:19.56]We can still do damage to it.
[206:22.25]Oh, careful.
[206:23.07]Oh my god!
[206:23.96]That was an awful spawn.
[206:28.72]That was a spawn deliberately to box me in.
[206:52.62]This orb is just spamming one move.
[206:55.59]It's a summoner.
[207:06.66]Be careful!
[207:07.84]I know, I got greedy.
[207:08.62]That was dumb.
[207:16.79]We might have to do this one more time.
[207:34.59]shit we need one more cycle fuck okay no we're good we've got we've got it we understand what is required of us I feel like there's less of them
[208:04.95]Alright, finish it.
[208:10.98]Finish.
[208:19.47]Dude, we beat it.
[208:20.27]It blows up and kills us.
[208:21.82]That'd be funny.
[208:25.70]Oh my God, I thought it happened.
[208:28.43]Let's just end the stream.
[208:33.77]that was kind of horrible oh no you've done it I feared that we were lost ill matter has truly sent you to us in our darkest hour I found this map did this foul someone did this horrid act on purpose
[209:02.02]all those deaths who would wish us such harm I intend to find out this is me and my friend over here I appreciate all you have done for us please accept this as a small token of our temple's thanks reward I will consult with our remaining priests and see if they can determine who was behind this evil act I will send someone to you should we discover anything
[209:28.03]wait for a messenger at the elf song tavern we will contact you should we learn anything go nice 750. that's a lot alright pick everything up and then I think that's a good place where we can call it for the day

[210:00.08]It was an epic time.

[210:04.65]Think we're good?
[210:07.61]Oh, shit.
