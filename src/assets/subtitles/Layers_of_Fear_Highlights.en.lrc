[06:36.31]Well, it was one of them.
[06:38.17]Did Mike Tyson ever paint?
[06:40.39]I don't want to be on an elevator right now.

[07:02.31]She took a piece of your skin, and she... left it on the fucking countertop, and you... Okay, none of the doors work, so that means when I turn around, there's gonna be something behind me.
[07:10.57]It's gonna be the person that we just saw.
[07:12.77]Nope.
[07:13.81]Ugh.

[08:40.66]I get to put the blood on the painting, right?
[08:42.86]That's how it works.
[08:56.48]That just made that even worse.
[08:58.00]Jeremy, you just don't understand art.
[08:59.64]No, I understand art.
[09:01.32]See, watch.
[09:01.82]See, look at this.

[10:05.27]Oh, hold on.
[10:05.73]Watch out for the brick wall.
[10:06.67]Watch out for the baby that's in one of these.
[10:08.21]Watch it.
[10:08.55]Here comes the baby.
[10:23.79]I don't like this guy.
[10:25.09]You know what we do to people like that?
[10:26.37]We send them away.
[10:27.25]We give them the electric chair.
[10:29.53]You know... murderers, serial killers...
[10:53.63]We send him to the jail.
[10:56.05]And then they get electrocuted in the electric chair.
[11:00.92]But apparently he's just painting with people's bodies and cutting people up.
[11:05.96]Oh shit, Teddy Ruxpin.
[11:08.91]I always hated Teddy Ruxpin when I was a kid.
[11:10.77]I want to be scared.
[11:18.52]Hey, uh, I see a sun in the corner, guys.
[11:21.03]Take a look at that sun.
[11:23.01]Not even the real sun.
[11:23.93]We all know what the real sun looks like.
[11:27.73]Right?
[11:27.93]I mean, you kind of have to walk down here.
[11:58.91]Surprise!
[12:00.11]It's impossible to feel scared.
[12:01.41]It is, it's scary.
[12:02.75]This is a scary game.
[12:05.49]Just watch.
[12:06.53]The baby's gonna come out and be like, in like two seconds and scare me.
[12:11.00]I told you!
[12:11.66]I knew it!
[12:13.00]I called it.
[12:20.10]Don't do it.
[12:21.12]Okay, where's the exit?
[12:40.64]Okay.
[12:41.39]I thought I was actually going crazy.
[12:46.77]Damn.
[12:48.19]Stop!
[12:48.89]What the f- Which- What direction am I even facing anymore?
[13:00.07]We're gonna keep doing this.
[13:06.15]I'll do this all day.
[13:14.12]I'm gonna come here, hold on.
[13:16.56]Come on, you gotta take a bath.
[13:17.86]I know, I didn't like taking baths when I was a kid either.
[13:31.80]Alright, fine.
[13:35.85]Just know that tomorrow morning before school, you're going to be mad because you didn't take a bath.
[13:59.80]Why?
[14:00.40]Why?
[14:00.48]This is supposed to be a scary game.
[14:25.11]I need to like stop the stream for a second.
[14:33.44]That kid just ran right into the fucking wall.
[14:42.42]I did not expect that to happen.
[14:52.73]Is that gonna happen again?
[14:53.89]I swear to God if that happens again.
[14:56.85]Oh my God, hold on a second, hold on.
[15:00.85]Wait a second, wait a minute.
[15:03.29]Wait a minute.
[15:04.81]It's gonna happen again.
[15:15.26]The French champagne has always been celebrated for sexiness.
[15:20.55]I can't do it.
[15:22.05]I can't take it.
[15:28.43]Who just subscribed?
[15:35.53]It was even better the second time.
[15:37.01]I don't even know who subbed.
[15:38.07]Hold on.
[15:38.43]Hold on a second.
[15:42.71]Hold on a minute.
[15:45.17]Camactically.
[15:46.14]Camactically.
[15:47.22]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[15:53.80]How did I do that again?
[15:54.82]Oh, shit.
[15:57.59]Go back.
[15:58.31]I want to do it again.
[16:08.35]I think I'm gonna die on camera.
[16:11.33]I think I'm gonna die on camera.
[16:26.03]Oh my god.
[16:53.96]It's broken.
[16:54.83]I broke my fucking laugh bone.
[16:57.25]I can't do it.
[16:57.99]I can't even laugh at it anymore.
[17:03.13]I can't even fucking think.
[17:09.47]I gotta get like five to come out at the same time.
[17:14.12]I feel like the asset is loading right here.
[17:16.94]You know what I mean?
[17:33.88]I can't even fucking imagine why you would have to do this.
[17:43.26]I can't even process why you would have that.
[17:50.26]Scary game.
[17:51.08]Alright, we gotta go.
[17:54.68]We gotta move on.
[17:55.40]We gotta go.
[17:56.50]We have to move on.
[17:57.32]I can't do it anymore.
[18:00.18]Watch out for the black goo.
[18:02.50]Don't touch the black goo.
[18:03.35]Don't touch it.
[18:05.01]I told you not to touch it.
[18:06.09]I told- What the fuck is going on?
[18:27.68]Watch out for the Jack in the Box.
[18:28.86]Watch out for the Jack in the Box.
[18:29.96]Watch out.
[18:39.50]Oh, there's the baby again.
[18:41.68]There's the baby again.
[18:42.63]I wonder if it's... I wonder if it's gonna like get slammed in the window.
[18:58.74]It kind of is happening.
[19:00.26]A little bit.
[19:16.06]Hush, little baby, the night is stark.
[19:17.76]What the hell is that?
[19:23.87]Stars fade above you, the room goes dark.
[19:31.81]Mama used to come to tuck you in.
[19:36.88]At that point, I hesitated.
[19:39.28]Will this really work?
[19:41.74]Fuck it.
[19:42.74]I was already halfway through.
[19:44.22]Besides, it's not like I could just...
[19:54.04]That was just rude.
[19:55.04]That was uncalled for.
[19:56.66]Why did I do that?
[19:57.30]That was rude.
[19:58.68]What's the painting of?
[20:09.21]It's a person.
[20:12.23]That's like a tour of Italy or something.
[20:14.65]No, they're fishing a dead person out of the water.
[20:16.25]That's not a tour of Italy.
[20:21.63]Oh, where's he going?
[20:23.01]Oh, he's crazy.
[20:23.79]He's knocking the floor.
[20:24.79]The fucking rat just trashed the place.
[20:29.93]He just fucking trashed the place.
[20:32.05]Hickory dickory dock.
[20:34.98]The mouse ran up the clock.
[20:37.88]The clock struck one.
[20:39.62]Horror ran down.
[20:41.42]Hickory dickory dock.
[20:47.00]Am I Vincent Price?
[20:48.30]No, there's the senator baby.
[20:51.75]All praise the senator, baby.
[21:01.89]What the fuck?
[21:03.95]Oh, Jesus.
[21:11.36]Oh, look at that.
[21:12.06]Uh-oh.
[21:14.70]It's a George Washington, baby.

[21:42.64]Oh, wow!
[21:46.77]Look at the track.
[21:51.02]He's gonna mean rap.
[21:57.74]This one's alive.
[21:58.50]Are we doing a seance?
[22:09.26]The lady's gonna grab me again.
[22:11.58]Oh my god!
[22:13.34]Who burnt the toast?
[22:14.82]Who burnt the fucking toast?
[22:19.08]I tell you, this is just getting fucking stupid.
[22:22.93]getting real sick and fucking tired of doing this shit Oh like magic yes that's when we let it go listen to this song hold on this is important
[22:49.88]This is like somebody singing in the shower.
[22:51.82]God dammit, you clogged the toilet again.
[23:01.26]What'd I tell you, honey?
[23:02.62]You're not supposed to put apples in the toilet.
[23:04.66]Don't you know?
[23:05.20]What are you, fucking stupid?
[23:07.82]Let's finish it.
[23:11.26]Finish the painting.
[23:12.21]Let's go.
[23:12.93]Finish it.
[23:24.27]Yes, that's it.
[23:28.93]It's beautiful.
[23:32.47]Perfect.
[23:35.25]Just like I always imagined.
[23:39.13]Oh, no.
[23:40.64]The painting's coming to life.
[23:42.38]What is this?
[23:44.94]I don't understand.
[23:46.04]That's so... No.
[23:49.70]Stop it.
[23:51.60]Please.
[23:56.40]Ah, I ruined it.
[23:59.45]Wait, didn't I- where's his finger?
[24:03.15]Didn't he cut his finger off?
[24:25.23]Don't tell me I'm going to take this into the bathtub.
[24:29.13]And we're going to hold our breath underneath.
[24:30.51]How many paintings has this guy done?
[24:51.57]Okay, for a second, I'm knocking alive for one second.
[24:54.79]I thought that was a picture of Donald Trump.
[24:58.27]I glanced over and was like, oh, it's Donald Trump?
[25:00.60]No, it's just like a baby.
[25:09.88]These are all the pictures.
[25:10.98]These are all the paintings.
[25:14.83]None of these were any good, apparently.
[25:16.23]He just didn't have any confidence in his own work.
[25:20.50]Oh, jock, jock, Jesus, Trump scare.
[25:22.90]Shit.
