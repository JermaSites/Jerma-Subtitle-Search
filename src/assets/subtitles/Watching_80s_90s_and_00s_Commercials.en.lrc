[00:25.70]Now, it didn't take me 15 minutes to write a tweet.
[00:27.70]I wanted to make sure that my drink was chilled.
[00:32.38]Cool.
[00:33.20]Cold.
[00:33.68]I didn't have any ice.
[00:38.22]Put it into the freezer.
[00:40.86]I was told, don't do that because your drink will explode.
[00:43.60]And I was just like, what?
[00:45.06]This is just baiting me for something weird, right?
[00:47.86]Like, what do you mean?
[00:51.91]Dude, don't put your drink in the freezer for five minutes.
[00:55.23]It's gonna explode.
[00:59.47]What?
[01:02.77]And then I was told, well, if you put a can or, you know, something that has compressed air, don't do that, right?
[01:08.97]Of course.
[01:10.53]But this is just me putting a cup in the freezer for like five minutes to chill it out.
[01:15.44]It is true.
[01:16.04]It's true.
[01:17.04]Well, don't be careful then.
[01:18.40]I didn't know that.
[01:21.31]I mean, I know, but if you feel like a can of soda, you don't want to really do that.
[01:30.07]Good night, Jerma.
[01:32.97]You're going to bed?
[01:34.95]Well, good night.
[01:35.43]See you later.
[01:36.07]You're going to bed?
[01:39.77]We're about to watch television commercials from 1980 to 2000.
[01:45.62]You're going to bed?
[01:48.84]Alright, probably got something to do.
[01:52.19]How are you doing?
[01:52.93]Have a good night.
[01:54.77]It's 5 in the morning right now.
[01:56.57]Where could you be right now where it's 5 a.m.?
[02:02.76]Where, like... Hawaii?
[02:05.72]Is Hawaii, like... How far back is Hawaii from right now?
[02:11.88]Asia?
[02:12.20]Would it be... No, it'd be earlier.
[02:13.54]It'd be like... Wouldn't it be like 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning?
[02:16.72]What time is it in Hawaii right now?
[02:27.83]Not right now.
[02:30.67]5 a.m.
[02:30.93]in Australia.
[02:31.55]OK, this always confuses me.
[02:36.86]Isn't is Australia is ahead of the United States, right?
[02:44.35]It's technically it's like 14 or 15 hours ahead.
[02:46.63]Not behind.
[02:51.08]So it's, is it right now?
[02:52.62]Is it the seventh?
[02:55.16]It's the seventh in Australia and New Zealand.
[02:59.90]Depends on your perspective.
[03:02.85]It's 5 AM in Iceland.
[03:06.65]Yes.
[03:06.85]Okay.
[03:10.07]So, this is your perspective.
[03:13.87]So at what point, you don't go backwards to go forwards, right?
[03:17.49]Well, I guess you kind of do.
[03:19.44]What time is it right now in Asia?
[03:21.50]Like, Japan, China, like what time is it right now?
[03:26.26]And is it, it's the 6th, right?
[03:29.28]Is it still the 6th?
[03:31.42]Is it the 5th in Asia?
[03:33.85]No.
[03:35.07]It's 6 a.m.
[03:36.09]in Korea.
[03:38.38]Is there anywhere on Earth... This is actually a pretty interesting thing to talk about.
[03:42.50]Is there a place... Are there more than a few places on Earth where it's over the course of three days?
[03:49.15]Like, is there a time period where it's the fifth in this place, the sixth in this place, and the seventh in this place?
[03:58.09]That there's no magic kind of hour where that happens?
[04:08.42]Sorry.
[04:09.38]That fucking hurt.
[04:16.65]Are you high?
[04:17.71]No!
[04:18.67]What are you talking about?
[04:21.63]I'm sorry.
[04:22.23]I looked over.
[04:23.47]Look, I'm just like kind of getting here.
[04:25.89]I'm getting ready for the day.
[04:27.21]Getting ready for the stream.
[04:28.45]And I'm talking about this.
[04:29.21]And I look over at the mod chat.
[04:31.32]And I've never seen this before.
[04:33.53]So they're just kind of like, what is he talking about?
[04:35.65]What I saw, VRJosh wrote, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[04:41.02]I'm like at least eight or nine ha's.
[04:43.54]I've never seen that over here.
[04:45.78]That's never happened.
[04:51.44]It was like, this is, no.
[04:54.50]Dr. Clay, what the fuck are you talking about?
[04:56.06]No one is three days ahead.
[04:57.40]No, no, no, no.
[04:58.16]Let me, listen.
[04:59.78]What I mean by that is, is there...
[05:03.44]Just let me explain for one second before it freaks out.
[05:06.96]So right now, okay, four hours ago, five hours ago, when it was 1159 p.m.
[05:16.55]in China, it is technically the fifth over there.
[05:24.09]It is then about 6 or 7 a.m.
[05:26.87]here, which is the sixth.
[05:29.47]In Australia, it's the seventh, right?
[05:35.13]At 1159 p.m.
[05:37.09]in China.
[05:40.99]I'm asking, is there a period where the time zones go over a few days?
[05:46.53]He's dumb.
[05:47.17]No, what the fuck, you idiot.
[05:51.30]Australia, the 24-hour cycle.
[05:56.44]It's 24 hours.
[05:57.36]I know, but I'm saying in that 24-hour period, is it possible?
[06:06.39]Dude, there aren't two suns.
[06:13.65]No, that's not what I'm saying.
[06:15.98]I need to like write this down, because I feel like you're all wrong.
[06:18.62]I feel like you're all wrong.
[06:22.38]If I take a plane and travel the world, the entire globe and beat the time zones, is it still the day it was for me on the plane?
[06:30.90]Precisely, exactly.
[06:38.28]Okay, everybody, shut up.
[06:41.66]We're watching commercials today.
[06:48.54]What are you saying?
[06:49.96]You're exploiting a glitch.
[06:55.86]I need to, like, write this down.
[06:57.22]11.59 PM in China is 7 AM in the United States, which is the next day in Australia.
[07:08.86]Somebody help me here.
[07:12.88]Oh, excuse me.
[07:14.38]Thank you, scientist that came in and fixed this.
[07:19.79]For the two hours between 10 and 1159 UTC each day, three different days are observed at the same time in different places.
[07:30.19]For example, at UTC time Thursday 10.15 it is Wednesday 23.15 in American Samoa and Friday 00.15 in
[07:45.19]Kiritimati, which is UTC plus 14, for the first hour, UTC 10 o'clock to dash 10 colon 59, this is true for both inhabited and uninhabited territories.
[07:57.31]But during the second hour, UTC 11 colon 00 dash 11 59, it is only true in an uninhabited maritime time zone 12 hours behind UTC UTC minus 12.
[08:08.51]So there you go.
[08:10.73]You just got absolutely decimated.
[08:12.93]I win.
[08:14.96]I win.
[08:15.48]I win.
[08:15.94]I win.
[08:16.40]I win.
[08:20.46]I was right.
[08:22.10]There was a scientist came in.
[08:37.35]No one cares.
[08:37.89]I do.
[08:38.31]Dude, be funny.
[08:46.40]Yeah, somebody got it right.
[08:47.78]Dude, that's a prank.
[08:50.54]No, there are three observed days in one day, in one small period.
[08:56.60]Explain what you just read without reading it.
[08:59.58]Okay.
[09:00.64]So there are boats.
[09:03.35]And... All I know is I'm right.
[09:08.05]All I know is I'm right.
[09:14.55]All I know is that I'm right.
[09:16.83]I have my reasoning.
[09:18.57]When it's 12, when it's 1159 p.m.
[09:22.59]in China, it is therefore colon 11-00 UTC 4 a.m.
[09:33.61]You got it right here.
[09:34.23]Somebody has it.
[09:34.67]Here's an image.
[09:37.56]Look at this.
[09:38.12]Look at this shit.
[09:38.80]Look at this shit.
[09:39.28]You ready for this?
[09:41.24]Oh, you guys are in trouble now.
[09:43.10]The overlapping time zones here are comfortable.
[09:46.82]Hold on, let me get this on screen.
[09:52.07]Oops.
[09:52.55]Okay, here we go.
[09:54.11]So here it is.
[09:57.71]Check this out.
[10:00.23]I would like all the people that just unsubscribed and unfollowed because this guy is such a moron.
[10:05.92]There's no way he can't even tie his shoes every day.
[10:08.80]I want you to look at this.
[10:28.08]What are the filters on this?
[10:31.38]Take a look.
[10:33.04]Oh, excuse me.
[10:35.12]Oh, excuse me.
[10:35.78]What happened?
[10:37.58]What's this?
[10:39.10]Oh, is this the overlapping time zones where that shows you where we have three, we observe three different days?
[10:46.17]Interesting.
[10:49.29]Interesting.
[10:55.07]Explain that.
[11:03.78]This is the middle of the ocean.
[11:06.50]Next to Alaska.
[11:08.52]There are three observable days.
[11:13.79]13.
[11:15.15]Explain what a time zone is.
[11:22.38]Time is a... No, it's not.
[11:24.46]What?
[11:26.82]Address the M&M, please.
[11:28.50]The last image that was saved here.
[11:30.18]And I just clicked it.
[11:34.50]I thought I watched a video on this.
[11:36.08]Yeah, everyone's calling me crazy.
[11:38.12]This is how it's actually this.
[11:39.60]There's more than two observable days and like for an hour a day at a very specific time period, which is very much explained in this graph.
[11:48.81]Which if you can't understand what this means,
[11:52.91]I mean, I do.
[11:54.23]So, on the left side of the line, it could be 12.01 a.m.
[11:57.73]on January 3rd.
[11:59.20]It would be January 2nd on most of the Earth.
[12:01.82]But the right side of the line would still be about 11.01 p.m.
[12:05.76]January 1st.
[12:06.52]You guys ready to watch commercials?
[12:14.57]Bro, just watch the commercials.
[12:21.79]There's so many people here that got like popcorn and drink.
[12:25.81]Like they're sitting around like a bunch of people waiting.
[12:28.29]And it's just like, I don't want to, I don't want to do this.
[12:37.56]Belly mouth.
[12:38.04]That is unbelievably funny.
[12:39.38]I'm going to have to steal this.
[12:43.90]I'm Tom Scott and I'm currently standing in the middle of the ocean during three simultaneous days.
[12:51.70]Behind me is a big boat.
[12:58.11]And that title, Tom Scott, that's a great video idea.
[13:02.53]The title of that video is, this video is over, like, something about three days.
[13:07.91]You know what I mean?
[13:08.35]Like, it is three days long in this video.
[13:11.39]Something, right?
[13:14.10]Like, this video, it is three days on this video.
[13:17.84]I don't know.
[13:18.26]He's so much smarter than I am.
[13:19.38]He'll be able to do it.
[13:22.33]He would have a banger title for that too.
[13:29.21]You know it would be super informative.
[13:31.05]It would break everything down like incredibly well.
[13:33.45]It would be so detailed.
[13:34.57]I would understand it so easily.
[13:41.99]This video took three days to film.
[13:44.17]Yeah.
[13:45.71]Perfect.
[13:46.27]Wow.
[13:47.63]Cool.
[13:48.69]Alright.
[13:48.93]You guys ready?
[13:49.31]We're going to watch commercials.
[13:50.37]We're going to watch infomercials.
[13:51.33]We've done this before.
[13:52.11]And it was confirmed that everybody told me that this was one of the best things I've ever done, which is alright.
[14:00.58]Like, hey, what's your, hey, community, what's your favorite thing I have ever done ever in the last 12 years?
[14:08.99]The time that you watched infomercials on stream.
[14:12.77]So, I mean, have to give the people what they want sometimes, right?
[14:16.57]So here it is.
[14:18.19]These are... There's a collection.
[14:19.55]And I didn't know this, but... I mean, look at the title of this.
[14:25.13]This is volume 956.
[14:26.60]There's a lot of these.
[14:30.54]So... Got some content for a little while, I think.
[14:34.44]What are you saying?
[14:42.53]You wish my wife a Merry Christmas.
[14:44.19]Have a Merry Christmas...
[14:48.33]Alright, just click play.
[14:50.03]No, I'm not ready.
[14:51.72]I need to explain what's happening today.
[14:57.32]Dude, did you pirate Elden Ring?
[15:02.36]What?
[15:03.36]What are you talking about?
[15:07.04]No, I bought it the day one.
[15:10.52]I bought it two days.
[15:12.12]What do you mean?
[15:14.52]Prove it.
[15:15.48]I played it on Steam.
[15:21.23]No, there's no wall penis.
[15:22.55]I would show you.
[15:28.71]Okay.
[15:29.55]So here we go.
[15:30.11]This is 80s commercials.
[15:31.72]We're going to break these down.
[15:32.74]I'm going to be frequently pausing.
[15:34.08]Those of you that are just going to be pissed off at my pausing.
[15:36.16]And we're going to begin.
[15:38.00]Look, we had to spend a little bit.
[15:38.98]We had to have people trickle in to hang out.
[15:49.71]Alright, one more image and we'll go.
[15:51.33]One more image.
[15:51.97]This is pretty good too.
[15:53.35]Everyone's favorite stream ever.
[15:55.59]Imagine if we did install for like 15 minutes.
[16:06.66]This is a good one though.
[16:11.34]Oh shit.
[16:12.54]What have I done?
[16:13.00]No, I'm good.
[16:18.65]Where is it?
[16:20.27]There it is.
[16:31.07]Green M&M.
[16:32.39]Live here.
[16:33.69]Sun up.
[16:34.25]Auto.
[16:34.83]Live here.
[16:35.39]Sun down.
[16:36.17]Live here.
[16:36.63]Midnight.
[16:37.43]Boat.
[16:44.89]Earth.
[16:48.49]Some of you guys got really into that, and I'm telling you, I was correct.
[16:55.86]Otto, live here.
[16:59.68]Alright, you guys ready?
[17:01.36]It's time to watch some commercials.
[17:03.98]Some of these are actually Christmas related.
[17:07.75]So, I mean, a lot of ads happen on Christmas time.
[17:12.29]And let's see.
[17:12.95]I don't know what these are.
[17:14.27]I have no idea.
[17:15.33]I know as much as you do.
[17:16.35]But I do.
[17:16.95]I'm going to remember some of these, I think.
[17:18.13]Maybe not the 80s ones, but the 90s ones.
[17:20.39]Finally.
[17:21.23]Time that person out for one second.
[17:23.95]Ready?
[17:24.13]Here we go.
[17:25.55]Make sure you can hear it.
[17:28.06]We'll do it.
[17:28.54]It's add.
[17:29.20]It's just add roulette.
[17:35.41]Mr. t and emmanuel lewis in a Christmas dream sponsored in part by all your friends at the mattel toy company okay these man battle armor he-man and skeletor each sold separately
[17:59.31]Oh, he has damage.
[18:01.21]Oh yeah?
[18:01.95]Battle Armor Skeletor has it too.
[18:05.59]Now the real fun begins.
[18:08.33]Battle Armor Skeletor and He-Man figures each sold separately from the Masters of the Universe collection.
[18:11.93]So they have damageable chests.
[18:16.62]Hi, Sheriff.
[18:17.64]What's good?
[18:19.32]The soup.
[18:20.54]I don't eat much soup anymore.
[18:21.70]It's good for you.
[18:23.16]This ad says Campbell's vegetable beef soup's a real good source of vitamin A. That's important.
[18:29.07]and another thing what it tastes good ma'am I'll have a bowl of that campbell soup please wait wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute are they eating campbell soup at a diner why is the diner serving campbell soup so you go they go into the restaurant and they order
[18:54.15]Oh, I'll have the soup, please.
[18:55.65]And it's just, they, they dumped it into the, into a big container?
[18:59.64]Hold on.
[19:01.98]Good for you.
[19:03.24]Oh, it's good for you.
[19:04.12]Lunch, oh, by the way, lunch of champions.
[19:07.52]This is on the news.
[19:08.76]This is all over the news.
[19:09.92]It's literally all over the news.
[19:12.14]That actually kind of looks gross.
[19:16.08]Doesn't that kind of look like shit?
[19:19.84]That's not like a good photo.
[19:27.24]But wait, wait, wait, wait.
[19:28.82]Campbell's vegetable beef soup's a real good source of vitamin A. That's important.
[19:33.70]Okay.
[19:34.02]And another thing.
[19:34.94]What?
[19:35.86]It tastes good.
[19:36.96]Right?
[19:38.04]Ma'am, I'll have a bowl of that Campbell's soup, please.
[19:43.69]Look at all the cans.
[19:49.27]Isn't the whole point of going to a restaurant that you wouldn't be served Campbell's out of a can dumped into a container and heated up?
[20:03.61]I'm very confused by this one.
[20:06.73]This is just a kitchen cabinet.
[20:07.87]And don't, let me, I'm going to be very, very clear about this.
[20:12.37]Campbell's soup is great.
[20:14.09]Campbell's soup, chicken noodle, tomato.
[20:16.63]I grew up on this.
[20:17.49]I love this stuff.
[20:20.10]But this is weird.
[20:22.46]This is very strange to say like, oh yeah, we're at the diner.
[20:26.72]Oh, don't you know, by the way, I'm like some random like sheriff.
[20:30.04]Oh yeah.
[20:30.68]Don't you know it's got vitamin A in it?
[20:33.51]It's like, why are we talking right now?
[20:36.43]Why are you telling me about this?
[20:39.35]Kid.
[20:40.49]Huh?
[20:42.77]Eat carefully.
[20:43.69]Eat carefully?
[20:44.53]That was weird.
[20:50.04]Here it comes.
[20:51.20]Diet Coke with 100% NutraSweet.
[20:53.56]A taste that's one of a kind.
[20:56.91]Wait, this... Why is there a jet?
[21:10.58]These dances!
[21:11.92]Oh, do you remember when America went to the moon?
[21:20.26]That was a lot in that one.
[21:21.10]Hold on.
[21:23.90]The thing about soda commercials that I think is just so strange...
[21:28.06]And I know chip commercials do stuff like this, too, but it's like
[21:33.34]who cares about any of this right just just drink the soda it's good like you ever see the like the this is a completely different tangent but the you've seen like the chip commercials where they have the it's like oh here's here's like a a potato chip commercial and it's always a couple of celebrities and they're just they're way too obsessed with these bags they're way too obsessed with this
[22:00.97]They hold it vertically.
[22:04.77]They hold the bags vertically at the bottom.
[22:08.50]Like this.
[22:09.74]They cup it like this.
[22:11.82]And it stands straight up.
[22:12.76]The bag always looks like it's made out of glass.
[22:15.82]It's this weird tube.
[22:16.78]It's like, look at these celebrities.
[22:19.16]They eat chips.
[22:21.84]So do I. Who fucking cares?
[22:22.89]So do I. Who cares that celebrities eat chips?
[22:26.57]Who cares?
[22:27.89]I do, too.
[22:28.43]You do.
[22:29.41]It's not like a thing that we have to... I don't get it.
[22:32.33]It's the same kind of world with soda commercials.
[22:35.13]People are, like, partying.
[22:37.29]Everyone's having such a good time.
[22:39.51]Look at where... Look, we went to space that time.
[22:41.92]It's like, just drink the drink.
[22:43.82]This is a lady taking a... What was she doing?
[22:49.86]Was that, like, a waterfall?
[22:52.02]Taking, like, a waterfall shower?
[22:54.06]What was that?
[22:59.09]What does this have to do with drinking soda?
[23:10.16]You know, it would be a much better commercial, and I'm serious.
[23:12.68]Get me on the marketing team.
[23:14.66]Just do what everybody does.
[23:16.52]This.
[23:19.06]Just have a guy, girl, doesn't matter, sitting down on a couch.
[23:22.70]It's just kind of dark in the room.
[23:25.88]And have him just go like this.
[23:27.52]This would be more realistic.
[23:49.30]would actually be a terrible commercial.
[23:51.68]Maybe just like, like the side air burp that everybody does.
[24:11.45]The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what you're doing.
[24:19.47]You never see anybody on TV just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face.
[24:25.26]Some people have a little too much fun on television.
[24:27.12]The soda commercial people, where do they summon this enthusiasm?
[24:32.60]Have you seen them?
[24:33.38]We have soda, we have soda, we have soda.
[24:36.39]Jumping, laughing, flying through the air.
[24:40.67]It's a can of soda.
[24:43.85]Have you ever been standing there and you're watching TV and you're drinking the exact product that they're advertising right there on TV?
[24:52.48]And it's like, you know, they're spiking volleyballs, jet skiing, girls in bikinis, and I'm standing there, maybe I'm...
[25:02.22]He's right.
[25:05.22]What, you can't have the same take?
[25:06.40]I actually do like the... Is that the American flag?
[25:20.33]Dude, people slam sodas in commercials too, by the way.
[25:25.61]Have you ever noticed that?
[25:27.16]People go like, SLAM!
[25:29.07]SLAM!
[25:29.67]SLAM!
[25:30.33]SLAM!
[25:30.77]And you're telling me there's not going to be a weird, gross side burp after that?
[25:34.98]They're full of shit.
[25:43.24]Introducing the world of Rainbow Brite, Starlight, and Murky, each sold separately.
[25:47.11]I'm Rainbow Brite, and I have the power of the rainbow to make everybody happy.
[25:51.97]I'm Murky, and it can't make me happy.
[25:53.75]With my purple star and your starlight, I can make you happy.
[25:59.21]Why is Q-Bert in this?
[26:00.49]Who's the weird Q-Bert guy?
[26:05.17]Starlight, Rainbow Brite, and Murky are each sold separately.
[26:08.27]The world of Rainbow Brite is new by Mattel.
[26:13.39]Why would you have a hamburger under the tree?
[26:35.66]This is a weird present.
[26:37.80]And the hamburger looks upside down but right side up at the same time.
[26:44.15]I wouldn't put my food on the ground.
[26:45.67]Can you imagine waking up on Christmas morning?
[26:49.39]It's like, alright, what do we got under the... Let's see what's happening.
[26:52.36]Everyone's so exciting.
[26:53.34]And it's like a Burger King or like a Hardee's or whatever.
[26:57.76]It's on the ground in front of the tree.
[27:02.24]I can understand a bag, right?
[27:04.56]There's a bag of Hardee's or a bag of Burger King, but it on the ground?
[27:08.64]I don't know about that.
[27:14.60]By the way, I've never had Hardee's before, not once.
[27:19.30]I've never eaten it before.
[27:20.64]That's a lie.
[27:21.20]No, it's not.
[27:21.92]I have never eaten Hardee's or Carl's Jr.
[27:24.48]Never in my entire life.
[27:25.83]It's mid.
[27:41.87]I've never had it.
[27:42.54]They just look huge.
[27:43.98]Everything looks gigantic in Hardy commercials.
[27:48.95]I like this one.
[27:49.91]This one's more realistic.
[27:51.37]But it's funny because the kid didn't get a single bit in his mouth.
[27:54.07]He picked it up a little too fast and it all dumped and he just, oh shit, there's nothing there.
[28:17.41]That looks actually pretty good.
[28:18.75]What?
[28:18.91]Wait.
[28:19.03]What?
[28:19.21]What?
[28:19.41]Hold on.
[28:19.65]Why?
[28:19.79]What?
[28:48.08]That was strange.
[28:51.76]Nobody said, she didn't say yes.
[28:59.50]God damn it.
[29:17.63]Okay.
[29:17.87]M&M's?
[29:18.05]Okay.
[29:19.59]Are they making it in their house?
[29:23.13]That was in the same house.
[29:47.44]They made it in the house.
[29:50.90]You know what's awesome about these ad compilation videos?
[29:57.02]You can tell what they taped.
[30:00.60]This is what they taped.
[30:01.62]You can see the intro and the outro of what show they were actually taping.
[30:05.21]And cut out.
[30:05.61]Next.
[30:16.34]if you're looking at video cassette recorders and you're confused by all your choices look at the most important feature of all the picture and Sony betamax records a sharper picture than VHS throughout the country more people said the picture was sharper with Sony betamax than VHS so why doesn't anyone else talk sharper pictures because no one else can beta maps a sharper picture what
[30:48.77]What happened with Betamax?
[30:51.91]Betamax was supposed to be better than VHS.
[30:56.35]And people just didn't care.
[31:00.23]The guy in the commercial even says it.
[31:02.41]He's like, how come more people aren't talking about Betamax?
[31:05.11]Because we're better than them.
[31:09.19]In tests throughout the country, more people said the picture was sharper with Sony Betamax than VHS.
[31:15.64]It was too expensive.
[31:16.46]Oh, that's what killed it.
[31:17.16]Betamax was better, but it was not as cheap.
[31:19.20]Interesting.
[31:19.72]Be like, get in class!
[31:21.00]What the fuck are you kids doing in the hallway?
[31:45.19]Get off the desk!
[32:15.28]Food's not even... Can you not eat in school?
[32:17.90]Wait, is it... Oh, this is after school.
[32:23.02]Alright, I will say...
[32:46.11]I would do something like this.
[32:49.73]I would.
[32:50.44]If I was hanging out with friends or something, we would go on there.
[32:55.14]I would do that.
[32:56.92]But this one hits pretty real for me.
[33:13.73]I don't know, I feel like I've been looking out the window, and like, Dad's out there with the big mower.
[33:18.15]And he's just like, Dad, what are you doing out there?
[33:21.58]He's so excited to cut the grass.
[33:23.60]No, that's a tractor.
[33:26.16]But still, I guess you're just kind of vibing out.
[33:34.11]But why the guy in the tractor?
[33:35.93]I love him.
[33:41.29]Dancing here we are.
[33:42.55]This is where it's cool school school School school School school
[34:11.51]Where?
[34:11.83]Studying in school.
[34:12.71]Kids studying in school.
[34:15.13]Oh, it's like after school.
[34:15.97]Guy in a tractor.
[34:20.04]Why is this guy here?
[34:21.86]School dance.
[34:24.42]School.
[34:27.00]In school.
[34:28.72]After school.
[34:30.08]We're coming out of school.
[34:31.76]This isn't a school.
[34:34.34]Where's the guy in the tractor?
[34:41.02]is snake not ready to take on how do they get McDonald's at school I don't know snake mountain with echo microphone new from the masters of the universe
[35:06.12]This is one of those products that the parent that buys it doesn't read the box, doesn't see the commercial, and realizes that it makes that kind of sound.
[35:17.99]And then they go, well, this sucks because now I'm going to have to listen to this.
[35:22.75]And then they just take the batteries out overnight one night and then tell the kid, oh, it's broken.
[35:28.96]And then the kid goes, what?
[35:30.68]Oh, and then they just do it normally and they don't need the extra added echo.
[35:34.82]Action figures each sold separately from Mattel.
[35:43.47]More food dancing.
[36:10.14]I mean that was alright.
[36:11.14]Somebody said milk is fucking gross.
[36:13.14]Hold on.
[36:37.54]Everybody's just chugging milk.
[36:47.62]Where are they?
[36:49.80]The questions I have with commercials like this are where are they?
[36:53.61]This is like Burger King, McDonald's, a restaurant.
[36:58.23]Everybody's just drinking.
[36:59.21]I guess, I guess they're kids.
[37:03.62]It's the local soda milk shop.
[37:05.80]That's what they're going for.
[37:06.70]Because this guy, you know, he's like, he's like John Travolta in Greece.
[37:11.10]Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[37:19.05]Let me make the bubbles.
[37:21.03]Milk.
[37:22.43]These two kids are hitting their heads.
[37:25.49]Pump up the bubbles.
[37:28.12]Barbie bubbling spa.
[37:30.82]Barbie bubbling spa comes with everything you see here.
[37:33.38]Barbie bubbling spa?
[37:37.16]Pizza Hut got this great offer.
[37:38.84]A Care Bear sticker book for only 49 cents with any pizza.
[37:42.68]Look, Mom.
[37:44.06]Here's Peter Pan.
[37:45.47]His model is full of stickers and pages of color.
[37:49.70]Oh, wait a minute.
[37:51.88]That was actually a pretty good reveal.
[38:14.93]The kid's like, look, I see him.
[38:16.03]Look, I see him.
[38:16.51]He's like, no, come on, kid.
[38:17.47]Give me a break.
[38:18.71]The mom sees him.
[38:24.27]That was a great ad.
[38:25.65]That was a great ad.
[38:26.69]They did a great job.
[38:29.53]That was, I mean, that was very clean.
[38:31.88]It was right to the point.
[38:33.00]It was a fun little plot twist.
[38:35.38]Good acting.
[38:36.48]That was a good one.
[38:37.40]I'm going to give it an A-.

[41:33.22]That's the first thing you ask when the aliens land?
[41:37.61]Regular or unleaded?
[41:42.21]He should have screamed I don't think that's a reaction you have I mean if he screamed it would have been so funny
[42:00.42]Well, if it sucked him up, I think that would have been so funny.
[42:05.53]Regular or super unleaded.
[42:10.59]Demetri was like, regular or super unleaded.
[42:14.79]They sucked him up and took off.
[42:17.64]And then at the Christmas special that he's at right now, he's not there.
[42:21.98]And he shows up like 30 minutes late with aliens.
[42:26.29]And they come onto the set, they got like costumes, alien costumes, and they're wearing Texaco gear.
[42:31.93]Like, wow, even the aliens use it.
[42:33.38]But they really missed an opportunity here.
[42:34.94]Seiko captures a golden era for women.
[42:45.36]The channel.

[42:56.72]Regular or super unlighted?
[43:01.54]They didn't even yell it.
[43:04.46]He would need to scream this.
[43:10.13]They can't hear him.
[43:13.39]Wait, but they said it's flashing empty?
[43:17.45]They need gas.
[43:19.55]Regular or super unlighted?
[43:24.30]Stopped in the galaxy to pick up a little bit of fuel.
[43:31.50]Oh, that's awesome.
[43:32.44]They run on gas.
[43:33.04]Oh, my God.
[43:33.54]That's funny.
[43:34.05]It's because the sign was so big.
[43:52.22]A rich, rich weaving of opulent texture.
[43:56.11]An interlocking of elegance and style.
[44:01.11]A Rolex?
[44:01.63]And the brilliant touch only a diamond can give.
[44:05.68]At Seiko, great technology inspires great design.
[44:10.34]Seiko, setting the standard for the world, for the future.
[44:14.93]Something about old commercials with the voiceover guy that had almost the Bia voice.
[44:19.95]They always talked like this.
[44:21.14]It was this... It was like this super... The Seiko watch will finally get... It was so low that it was almost unbelievable how low this person is talking in these old commercials.
[44:33.54]Technology inspires great design.
[44:36.34]Inspires great... I don't think humans can make this.
[44:40.08]I don't think humans can do this anymore.
[44:42.54]Seiko setting the standard for the world for the future.
[44:45.94]I can't do it.
[44:50.08]Now Seiko gives you the moon.

[45:34.14]Bro, that's a lot of fire near that tree.
[45:39.08]We at Ocean Spray are indeed proud to be a part of your holidays again this year.
[45:44.38]May they be the warmest ever.
[45:49.27]What?
[45:50.19]Lots of motor oils talk protection and mileage.
[45:53.41]I want proof.
[45:54.67]Proof?
[45:55.29]New York taxis drove over a quarter million punishing miles with no oil-related failures.
[45:59.91]That's Havlin Supreme Protection.
[46:02.58]Not bad, but... Proof.
[46:04.42]After a million miles of state trooper driving, no oil-related failures.
[46:08.24]That's Haviland Supreme protection.
[46:10.14]No kidding.
[46:11.10]Proof.
[46:11.90]In fuel economy tests, it delivered improved mileage.
[46:14.70]He's still skeptical.
[46:15.36]Texaco Haviland Supreme.
[46:17.76]They've got the proof.
[46:20.18]Monday, it's an all-new Little House movie.
[46:22.08]A two-hour Christmas special.
[46:23.62]Will the holidays bring tragedy when Laura's baby is kidnapped?
[46:26.40]Why did you leave her?
[46:27.40]Bless all the dear children Monday.
[46:30.09]I'm Jane Pauley.
[46:30.83]Tomorrow on Today, part one of a five-part interview with Burt Reynolds.
[46:34.23]Also, Kyle MacLachlan, the young star of Dune.
[46:37.11]Join us tomorrow on Today.
[46:38.09]He seemed really annoyed there.
[46:39.11]He got proven wrong.
[46:40.58]When your car knocks driving uphill, does everybody pass you?
[46:44.14]Everybody is passing you.
[46:45.42]I'm well aware of that fact, Eunice.
[46:47.98]Oh, it's only a Comet, Walter.
[46:49.66]And I took note of the Comet units.
[46:51.40]Try Texaco's higher octane.
[46:53.12]It gave powerful turbos even more power against regular unleaded Texaco.
[46:56.86]Dude, that's not the problem.
[46:57.52]Super unleaded boosted acceleration almost 12%.
[46:59.52]Isn't that Werner Lutz?
[47:02.09]We went to high school together.
[47:03.75]My God, you're right.
[47:04.71]I thought Werner was dead.
[47:06.03]Texaco's super unleaded superstar power for more car power.
[47:10.37]Hi, Bob Do-It-Yourself Hope here.
[47:17.24]And after the aliens, I'm a completely different man.
[47:26.73]I was going to say something about this.
[47:28.57]Oh, right.
[47:28.97]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[47:29.47]Okay, so here's the interesting thing about this.
[47:32.95]It doesn't matter how much gas is in your car or what kind of gas is in your car.
[47:37.24]If you press like a quarter of a pound of pressure on your gas pedal, you're going to go three miles per hour.
[47:50.30]You could have zero gas in your tank.
[47:54.12]I mean, like, a sneeze of it.
[47:57.14]Just enough to get into the intake, right?
[47:59.88]And floor it, and you'd go... And you'd, I mean, you'd go fucking 100 miles, you'd go fast.
[48:06.97]And then you'd stall out eventually, but... That's really bad for the engine.
[48:17.65]I'm not saying to do that.
[48:20.21]I'm just saying this doesn't make any sense.
[48:21.96]He's not even pressing the gas.
[48:26.92]Is it implied that he's flooring it?
[48:28.64]And he's, oh, our gas is proof.
[48:31.60]There's no proof.
[48:34.38]Star power for more car power.
[48:36.78]Hi, Bob Do it Yourself Hope here for Haviland Supreme Motor Oil.
[48:40.42]Texaco's formula with its dyne additive gives proven engine protection against wear, rust, and corrosion.
[48:46.76]And Haviland's friction fighter reduces engine friction to help save gasoline in your car.
[48:51.68]Next time you change oil, get the motor oil that gives you proven engine protection.
[48:56.71]Alright, and check this out.
[49:02.39]It blows a fireball.
[49:05.51]Stay tuned for more of Bob Hope's Jolly Christmas Hour right after this station break.
[49:23.80]Tuesday on the A-Team, who's got the guts to grab Mr. T's gold and chain him to Murdoch?
[49:27.70]Like taking downtown Tokyo away from Godzilla.
[49:30.22]And on Riptide, Murray the powerful, Murray the ruthless, Murray the media star?
[49:34.75]I think we created a monster.
[49:36.33]And on Remington Steel, one of these masterful mystery writers has murder in mind for Laura and Steel.
[49:42.07]Tuesday.
[49:44.73]When a neighborhood starts to die, it seems there's nothing anyone can do to save it.
[49:48.51]Did she just fly into them?
[49:49.49]But that's not true.
[49:50.37]Riding in... Is that a wheelchair?
[49:51.99]And they explode.
[49:53.45]Why do they explode?
[49:54.21]Why?
[50:03.16]When a neighborhood starts to die, it seems there's nothing anyone can do to save it.
[50:07.50]But that's not true.
[50:08.72]With enough caring, a neighborhood can live.
[50:11.22]Citibank knows it.
[50:12.58]And Citibank knows it takes a lot of people and a lot of hard work.
[50:16.26]For over 15 years, we've helped restore communities throughout the New York area.
[50:20.60]We provide more money for more housing than any other bank in New York.
[50:23.64]We have a commitment to this city.
[50:25.96]After all, it's our city, too.
[50:28.00]It's your city, Citibank.
[50:33.14]Metro North drills for disaster.
[50:35.02]Story at 11.
[50:36.14]Oh, we're back to Bob Holmes.
[50:40.36]Oh, holiday Christmas hour.
[50:42.25]No, no, we're not.
[50:44.51]Bob, he's a pro.
[50:46.79]I can't beat him.
[50:48.15]I fixed the race.
[50:48.99]He's driving on regular unleaded, but you've got Texaco super unleaded.
[50:53.81]But I. Whoa.
[50:55.29]In an identical turbo car, it can boost power.
[50:57.93]These people, these people are not in a race.
[51:01.83]Are they?
[51:03.79]What is Bob doing here?
[51:04.91]Even against a... It is... It does look like Trump.
[51:12.14]Bob, he's a pro.
[51:17.47]I can't...
[51:29.43]That's Donald Trump right there.
[51:31.57]That's Donald Trump.
[51:33.53]Okay, if you said, Jerma, I'll give you a million dollars if you tell me who this person is.
[51:39.07]I'll give you a million dollars in cash in like a handful of briefcases.
[51:42.91]Who is this guy on camera right now?
[51:45.32]That is Donald Trump.
[51:48.34]And I would bet my life on it.
[51:56.19]You know what's crazy?
[51:56.91]All the weird commercials Donald Trump used to do, I would not be surprised if he was here just doing that.
[52:26.02]Even against a pro in an identical turbo car, it can boost power, improving acceleration up steep grades almost 12%.
[52:33.31]I won!
[52:33.75]I won!
[52:34.15]When you need more octane, Super Star Power gives you more car power.
[52:38.77]I won!
[52:39.25]I won!
[52:39.51]Next time you get the Texaco Super... Why does he have one of these in his trunk?
[52:46.93]This is not a gas station.
[52:48.41]This is implied that he carries this around with him.
[52:50.80]He just has a gas pump?
[52:54.83]This is not a station.
[52:59.31]I won, I won.
[53:00.45]And then he goes... Blows another fireball.
[53:07.63]It's his thing he does in these.
[53:12.19]Behind the new Texaco star, there's a new Texaco.
[53:16.40]LaSalle Seiko.
[53:19.20]Superb design.
[53:21.00]Responding to the challenge of the highest quartz technology.
[53:25.39]I'm not a watch guy.
[53:26.51]I feel like I'd be super aware of it all the time.
[53:51.34]Like, it would, you know, if I'm wearing a long sleeve, it pops out, and yeah.
[53:58.08]I don't know.
[53:58.46]I feel like I'd be so aware of it.
[54:00.00]Oh, yeah, that's that.
[54:00.89]I have that on.
[54:01.97]And let me show it to you.
[54:06.65]I mean, I'm not against, you know, this is like, oh, are you against jewelry?
[54:10.61]Or are you against accessories?
[54:13.35]No, no, not necessarily.
[54:14.93]But, like, you know, if you have, like, a regular watch, just like, oh, this thing is a watch.
[54:17.93]It tells time or something, right?
[54:20.23]But I don't know, I feel like I would be always under pressure to show people that I'm wearing one of these watches.
[54:26.78]If it's on, it's almost like you're wearing it and it's this big, gold, beautiful, how much does it cost?
[54:33.42]It's expensive and it's beautiful and it's class, right?
[54:36.54]I feel like you don't, I don't know, I feel like you would be constantly going.
[54:46.51]And then the cashier at the grocery store is just like,
[54:51.38]Okay.
[54:52.50]That'll be $49.
[54:53.70]You know what I mean?
[54:56.18]I feel like I'll be constantly under pressure.
[54:58.87]I don't want to be under pressure.
[55:03.05]You eat smoke for 12 hours.
[55:07.19]What?
[55:07.87]So hot you feel like you're working inside a furnace.
[55:11.13]Yeah, you get a headache.
[55:12.57]Oh, okay.
[55:12.89]You want something strong.
[55:15.97]Anderson.
[55:19.31]I thought he was telling us like this is a crazy fact that you need to know.
[55:24.33]What a wild fact.
[55:25.33]You like eat smoke all day.
[55:27.43]That's what I thought it was.
[55:28.07]Inside a furnace.
[55:33.13]You eat smoke for 12 hours.
[55:37.95]So hot you feel like you're working inside a furnace.
[55:41.19]Yeah, you get a headache.
[55:43.67]You want something strong.
[55:46.05]Anacin.
[55:47.32]Anacin.
[55:48.88]23% more medicine than regular pain relievers.
[55:51.00]Anacin.
[55:52.52]I thought that was a Snickers bar.
[55:58.67]Stops pain fast.
[56:00.63]Headaches gone.
[56:02.43]And no stomach upset.
[56:05.37]It really takes the heat off.
[56:07.96]Anderson, more medicine.
[56:10.39]Take a close look at a new small car from today.
[56:13.71]Yeah, I'm going to give that commercial an A-.
[56:16.95]This is an A- because it was super to the point.
[56:20.13]It's just, hey, headaches suck.
[56:23.63]And, you know, if I'm working and I got a headache, I need something.
[56:26.75]This is an A- for me.
[56:28.63]Headaches gone.
[56:30.43]And no stomach upset.
[56:33.31]That really takes the heat off.
[56:35.96]Anderson.
[56:36.72]That's not Bob Hope.
[56:38.40]Take a close look at a new small car.
[56:40.86]That's not Bob.
[56:41.38]If it was Bob Hope, he would have been saying something along the lines of this.
[56:45.59]The thing about it is headaches are really, really tough.
[56:50.53]But you know, it's not a headache.
[56:51.53]And he steps out of the way and there's a Texaco gas pump behind him.
[56:55.69]Filling up with super unleaded.
[56:58.62]Texaco gas is cleaner.
[57:00.12]He would step out of the way and it would not be a headache commercial anymore.
[57:05.51]Uh-oh.
[57:05.71]Bob!
[57:05.95]Bob!
[57:06.57]Unleaded fuel only.
[57:07.41]Not super unleaded fuel.
[57:38.01]Uh-oh.
[57:41.93]Zero to 50 in 8.2 seconds.
[57:44.57]Spectrum's economy comes from the highest gas mileage of any sedan in America.
[57:48.92]Discover new Spectrum, the sporty car of our everyday driving.
[57:52.94]That's not how it works, though.
[57:59.20]Another one of these.
[58:00.72]Didn't we see this already?
[58:12.65]We can also play a game, if you guys want, where we watch the first five seconds, and if the product's not there, we have to guess what the product will be.
[58:19.29]I like that.
[58:19.65]That's fun, too.
[58:22.71]Again, that's a lot of candles.
[58:26.97]We at Ocean Spray are indeed proud to be a part of your holiday weekend this year.
[58:32.31]May they be the warmest ever.
[58:34.25]We'll do that on the next one.
[58:37.87]A premiere, Bob?
[58:39.21]Where are the stars?
[58:40.23]Watch.
[58:41.77]Wowee!
[58:42.91]The premiere of another new Texaco self-serve.
[58:46.13]You want stars, Loretta?
[58:47.35]Look, a great food store.
[58:49.09]Hold on a second.
[58:49.97]Let me blind this pilot for a few seconds.
[58:51.83]Star treatment.
[58:53.49]Super star power for Lord Horror Power.
[58:55.77]And that star of stars.
[58:57.65]I thought you'd never notice.
[58:58.91]The new Texaco star.
[59:01.15]Wait a minute.
[59:01.87]The UFO is coming.
[59:02.63]It's right here.
[59:04.21]He made a pact with the aliens.
[59:05.89]Did you see that?
[59:07.47]He's signaling to the aliens.
[59:30.57]Next, it's a spectacular national celebration with Donny and Marie Osmond, Gimme a Break's Nell Carter, host Hal Linden, and the U.S.
[59:36.75]Naval Academy Choir.
[59:37.98]Christmas in Washington.
[59:39.10]The music that moved the world's hearts.
[59:44.86]Okay.
[59:46.50]I... If we were playing the game to pause after one second... I would have said it was for cheese.
[59:55.63]I would have said it was a cheese commercial.
[59:58.41]But that's not what this is.
[60:00.19]This is... This is the... Music that moved the world's heart to song.
[60:04.21]The joy and warmth.
[60:05.49]I was going to go all in for a cheese commercial.
[60:07.35]The Sound of Music.
[60:08.59]Starring Julie Andrews in her most captivating role.
[60:12.77]Or a cough drop, yep.

[61:30.46]That was quality.
[61:38.01]What is on the wall?
[61:39.19]There is currently nothing on the wall.
[61:42.55]I promise I would show it if there was.
[61:45.01]Alright, so that's that one.
[61:46.27]Pretty cool.
[61:47.89]That was 80s commercials.
[61:52.91]I'm so sorry.
[61:53.87]I gotta stop that.
[61:55.63]I'm trying to make a point as to what people do to go back because everyone was like, that joke was bad, but it wasn't though.
[62:02.31]Alright, so.
[62:05.19]This one.
[62:06.00]Do we want to do 80s?

[62:21.71]80s?
[62:21.77]I mean, I'll do it.

[62:23.79]I mean, this is the whole time.
[62:26.11]Do a 90s one?
[62:29.45]Alright, let me get a 90s one.
[62:30.40]Alright, we'll do a 90s one.
[62:35.90]Alright, 90s.
[62:37.58]This is 90s commercials, volume 410.
[62:39.88]Here we go.
[62:47.60]we're gonna do it right this one's kind of cheating because this is when this is when I grew up this is when I was younger so I'm gonna know a lot of these probably we'll see let's play it two seconds or three seconds three okay here we go what a show
[63:12.81]This program is brought to you by Barks, the one with bite.
[63:16.35]It's going to be Barks root beer.
[63:18.27]I think we already know that.
[63:19.51]I'm going to put my bet on Barks root beer incoming.
[63:30.80]Okay.
[63:31.96]You guys making your bets here?
[63:34.42]Barks root beer.
[63:35.45]Let's see.
[63:38.70]What the hell was that?
[63:39.68]What happened?
[63:40.80]Why did they just kick that guy?
[63:42.07]Oh, it's temporary tattoos.
[63:43.33]Dude, that was such a trope in the 90s.
[63:45.55]The old lady.
[64:08.70]That's sitting there, leaning into the camera, saying, no, no, no.
[64:13.84]Every gum commercial, every soda commercial, anything that was geared towards the younger audience, grandma was telling you, you can't have that.
[64:26.54]No, this is for grandma.
[64:28.19]It's like, no, it's not.
[64:31.01]No, it's not.
[64:31.95]It's for me.
[64:32.97]Okay.
[64:44.08]This is obviously for a CD player or a... I got to get it right though.
[64:47.36]Was that a tape?
[64:48.50]This is 90s.
[64:48.80]Is that a tape player or a CD player?
[64:55.64]When in the 90s though?
[64:58.20]I'm going to say that's a CD player.
[65:02.70]don't know what company though but let's see it's a cd player okay I swear this is a real memory I hope I don't think I'm making this up but I feel like I actually did this these are the cd players that didn't skip
[65:26.65]Because back in the day, when you had a CD player, it was feeding you the music in very real time, almost like a record player.
[65:36.50]And if you moved, and I'm talking even touched it, it would go, and skip, skip, skip, skip, skip in your ears.
[65:44.97]You couldn't touch it because it was reading it in real time.
[65:47.37]They came out with this technology where it was no CD skipping.
[65:52.69]And what I imagined it did is it like took the audio, buffered it, and then put it up to you, right?
[65:59.01]Like about maybe like four or five seconds.
[66:01.87]And I remember people, it was such a huge jump in the music world that I remember people would take those and be like, hey, yeah, look at this.
[66:11.29]See, put the headphones in.
[66:13.17]See, you're not skipping, right?
[66:15.15]Not skipping.
[66:16.19]And like they'd break them because they were trying to prove a point.
[66:18.75]And I feel like I did that to one that I had.
[66:22.66]Like, I had this weird memory of me doing that, being like, look, see?
[66:26.70]Smack!
[66:27.46]Smack!
[66:28.00]And it not skipping, and then the thing kind of sounded like shit for the next, like, ten times I used it, and I stopped using it.
[66:35.12]So, so many people were so obsessed with proving to you that it would work, that they made it not work.
[66:43.89]Anyway, they had little bars on them.
[66:46.58]And it was loading.
[66:47.47]It was like a little loading bar.
[66:48.57]It was like one, two, three, four, five.
[66:50.67]If you had five bars of juice, it was like you could... Why are you saying F?
[66:58.73]What happened?
[67:02.10]Well, stop hitting my screen.
[67:03.70]Stop hitting my stream.
[67:08.54]You got to stop bumping the stream.
[67:10.10]What the fuck are you doing?
[67:11.46]Relax.
[67:12.47]Sit in your chair normally.
[67:14.05]Like this.
[67:14.71]Don't move.
[67:17.72]Oh, isn't Twitch having a bunch of problems?
[67:20.02]Like, yeah, I got no drop frames.
[67:24.98]Right when I start talking about this, that's so stupid.
[67:27.34]Well, Twitch is having problems.
[67:28.28]Whatever.
[67:28.60]It's all good.
[67:29.27]I've heard about that.
[67:30.93]Alright, let's keep going.
[67:32.17]Are we good?
[67:32.75]Everybody good for me?
[67:34.03]Everybody good for me?
[67:36.65]Like, everyone's, like, waiting for me?
[67:38.47]Are you good for me to begin?
[67:39.59]Are you good for me to start?
[67:52.33]Does it skip?
[67:53.63]There it was!
[67:54.13]See the bars?
[67:58.04]Nothing un-leashes it.
[68:02.18]Get out of the phone!
[68:03.14]Get out of the phone!
[68:04.14]Wait, hold on.
[68:05.20]I gotta start this over.
[68:15.35]There's the Accord with air automatic and ABS for $19,700.
[68:20.63]And then there's the Grand Am with all that for $5,000 less.
[68:24.13]Grand Am just makes a lot of sense.
[68:25.99]It's affordable.
[68:27.51]Drives great.
[68:29.21]Sporty.
[68:29.91]Who is selling the car to who?
[68:32.81]We get free 24-hour roadside assistance.
[68:35.49]Besides, we like the Grand Am better anyway, right?
[68:40.18]Let's get a salesperson.
[68:41.34]Yeah.
[68:42.08]Oh, there's...
[68:49.00]Alright, whatever.
[68:50.48]Neither.
[68:50.84]Hold on.
[68:51.72]He's doing... Arnold is doing the thing.
[68:53.34]The YouTuber thing.
[68:53.82]Where he goes to switch the camera off to cut to do a different take.
[68:59.38]Watch him.
[69:18.95]last action hero what do you think of anyone who doesn't see this movie big mistake but it's old but look at what he's doing it's like he's saying his line and then he's like oh let me have that one turn out let me try it again think of anyone who doesn't see this movie big mistake everybody knows when you do that though that's why you got to do it in post there's no way to let go nope you got it you can't move
[69:49.02]Different people will know.
[69:53.50]I love this place.
[69:55.07]I think it's the biggest movie of the summer.
[69:58.77]And now when you go to Burger King and order a flame broiled Whopper with large fries and a medium drink, you get this last action hero anime.
[70:04.67]Whoa, that's actually sick.
[70:05.99]Like him, you can be large and in charge.
[70:08.45]So see the movie and collect all four cups.
[70:10.59]It's your way right away.

[70:35.79]How early in the 90s?
[70:37.41]This is showing very, very detailed video conferencing.
[71:02.03]You couldn't do that.
[71:04.93]Look at this.
[71:10.75]This is a detailed video broadcasting software.
[71:16.48]I don't think you could do this.
[71:24.68]Also, there's no way anyone could hear what he's saying.
[71:26.80]He's just going off and just talking to himself.
[71:31.01]By the way, I've got a few other ideas.
[71:32.15]Let me go over here and talk out the window.
[71:34.75]So nobody hears what I'm saying.
[71:35.88]We just skipped that guy.
[71:38.92]He's kind of like Omegle.
[71:40.02]He just skipped him.

[81:09.48]I'd like to play you something.
[81:11.11]that I recorded literally yesterday.
[81:16.11]Those of you that have... This is a great, great segue.
[81:18.99]So those of you that have been on the channel for a long time, you know that whenever I get a lot of food in my throat, I get the Tom Hanks voice.
[81:29.42]And let me tell you, what I recorded is unbelievable.
[81:35.99]I caught it super perfectly.
[81:39.37]Super good.
[81:43.89]So the Tom Hanks, the voice thing I'm talking about, yeah, when you, when you, if you eat and you get kind of food kind of stuck a little bit there, like milk voice a little bit, for some reason it makes me sound just like him.
[81:53.52]So I recorded this.
[81:54.48]This was literally last night.
[81:59.39]and I won't sound like Tom Hanks anymore.
[82:02.00]And when you finally get the Tom Hanks voice, that's when you really can shine as an actor and be a part of... I was in Forrest Gump, and I was... You know, I was Woody in Toy Story.
[82:13.83]Remember, it's me, Woody, and you, Buzz, are going to get us in trouble with Andy.

[82:53.68]Buzz, you're going to get us in trouble with Andy.
[82:57.68]Was, yeah, they don't,
[83:00.69]Andy's not like their dad.
[83:02.61]Andy doesn't even know they exist.

[91:11.65]The Grand Am Sport Coupe.
[91:14.31]V6 performance.
[91:15.73]The control of anti-lock brakes.
[91:20.81]We are driving excitement.
[91:25.51]The only reason you would have a drive like this in these commercials is if you thought you were going to shit your pants and you had to make it to a bathroom as soon as possible.
[91:45.71]They saw these people flying around these little roads.
[92:01.92]Look at that back.

[92:17.17]This is the taste that takes you there.
[92:22.80]Alright.
[92:23.46]Like, it's cool that they did this commercial, but, you know, I don't appreciate the multi-boxing.
[92:30.41]It's good.
[92:33.98]This is the taste that takes you there.
[92:53.28]A+.
[92:53.38]That was an A+.
[92:57.50]That was to the point.
[92:58.54]That was very much just to the point.
[93:00.18]It was just, hey, Tabasco is fucking awesome.
[93:03.94]And like, when that first little drop comes out, it's like, this is cool.
[93:09.16]It's like, yeah.
[93:10.86]Tabasco is gross.
[93:15.06]I mean, you're... That's just... That's... No.
[93:22.41]I don't trust anybody that says that Tabasco is gross.
[93:26.48]If you say that Tabasco is not your favorite, if you say that Tabasco is something you don't choose, I don't prefer Tabasco, but saying Tabasco is gross, I don't trust you.
[93:39.37]Mods, can we get a poll real quick?
[93:43.39]Is Tabasco gross?
[93:45.61]And remember, gross does not mean I don't really like it.
[93:48.49]Gross means like you taste it and you're like, ugh.
[93:52.75]Just regular, just Tabasco, the default Tabasco.
[93:57.55]Tabasco on eggs is amazing.
[93:58.87]Yes, it is.
[93:59.69]It's also amazing on pizza.
[94:04.04]Is it gross?
[94:10.42]If this is more than 10 to 20%, then that's no way.
[94:16.22]I want to do one more thing after this before we keep going.
[94:23.24]20% so far.
[94:27.12]But gross?
[94:28.00]Why do you think it's gross?
[94:37.43]Enjoy your vinegar water.
[94:42.99]Don't ever have salad dressing ever again for the rest of your life.
[94:56.51]Alright, alright, close that poll.
[94:57.85]21% said it was gross.
[94:59.67]I have a new poll I'd like to run.
[95:00.93]Because this is going to determine how I feel.
[95:08.04]Okay.
[95:09.76]So remember, is it gross?
[95:13.55]Is sriracha gross?
[95:16.19]New poll.
[95:16.91]Yes or no?
[95:18.67]Is sriracha gross?
[95:26.40]Let's see.
[95:27.22]I'm curious.
[95:28.42]I want to see how this lines up.
[95:35.60]Okay.
[95:43.26]It's almost the exact same.
[95:47.90]It's actually almost identical.
[95:51.18]Do 20% of you just don't like, you just hate hot sauce?
[95:58.23]It's the exact same.
[96:00.49]I think that 20% of you just don't like hot stuff.
[96:04.40]So... It's good.
[96:06.18]Alright.
[96:06.48]I probably should have worded this better.
[96:10.08]If you like hot sauce... Whatever.
[96:17.33]I got what I wanted out of this.
[96:19.99]I prefer Tabasco.
[96:20.69]You know what I mean?
[96:23.05]You know what I'm saying?
[96:24.69]You know what I'm saying?
[96:26.91]You know what I'm saying?
[96:28.63]I prefer Tabasco.
[96:29.27]You know what I mean?
[96:37.64]I'm not, we're not doing, no, no new poll, no new poll.
[96:44.44]I like Cholula.
[96:46.02]Yeah.
[96:48.03]But, very important thing about Cholula.
[96:50.97]See, to me, Cholula...
[96:53.76]is good on different foods.
[96:57.14]I prefer Cholula in a taco.
[96:59.46]I prefer Cholula in, you know, with like avocado and not, I can't say which one's better because I prefer Cholula on very specific foods, right?
[97:15.87]Tapatio is also great.
[97:17.15]I would put it in the same category as Cholula.
[97:21.68]Yeah, they're not exactly the same kind of sauce.
[97:25.45]But I actually really don't like Sriracha.
[97:29.27]I don't know.
[97:30.11]I don't like it.
[97:30.49]I don't think it's gross.
[97:33.31]I just don't really like it.
[97:44.47]What is it?
[97:45.65]This is a pretty, this is gonna be a hard one.
[97:49.21]I'm gonna say coffee.
[97:50.51]Either coffee or...
[98:12.02]Somebody said life insurance.
[98:14.10]A vacation planner.
[98:15.05]I'm going to say it's consumable.
[98:18.81]It's a coffee.
[98:19.55]It's a beverage.
[98:23.37]An airline.
[98:23.95]That's a good one.
[98:26.30]Insurance.

[103:09.70]What did he do?
[103:10.48]Look at my big fat gun.

[104:35.36]I'll do it with the shirt.
[104:36.98]Oh, nevermind.
[104:47.06]This lady.

[105:03.23]God damn it, it's so funny.
[105:05.01]We need to make this slower.
[105:09.02]It's almost like he's doing it on purpose.
[105:33.67]How does he know what she is looking at here?
[105:38.15]He does it before he even looks down.
[105:44.51]right it's like how did he know why it why would you just sit there just looking at a group of people doing like hey look at how fat I am
[106:14.45]I'm reading too far into it, but it's doing it for me.
[106:17.85]It's, I don't know, it's so fucking weird.
[106:23.46]This guy actually, like, he's like, he's bent.
[106:29.12]He's sucking it in.
[106:34.59]He's doing it for you?
[106:35.77]What are you talking about?
[106:39.09]Alright.
[106:39.79]We're moving on.

[106:46.89]I can't.

[108:22.16]Thanks.
[108:22.94]To get yours, call now and own the best... Three episodes?
[108:26.04]Good evening, everybody.
[108:29.50]So don't say adios to the good people at Cheers.
[108:32.38]Keep the laughs coming with your Cheers video cassettes.
[108:35.06]Delivered right to your door by 5 million women in uniform.
[108:39.22]Use your credit card and call now for your first three episodes.
[108:41.64]It's because it's a VHS, guys.
[108:45.78]VHSs were at maximum, they were what, 90 minutes?
[108:52.20]Yeah.
[108:53.12]Because there was two recording versions of VHS.
[108:56.39]You could do 60 or 120 or 60 or 90, right?
[108:58.11]What was the difference?
[109:03.86]You could have, was it the size of the tape or something?
[109:07.12]It was 120 max.
[109:09.74]It was a lower resolution on 90.
[109:11.50]Yeah.
[109:12.14]It was the quality difference.
[109:13.94]So weird.
[109:17.86]Hearing this now is just, this is so strange to see this.
[109:21.96]Three episodes.
[109:27.62]And guess what?
[109:30.10]Back... I know a lot of people might not be used to this.
[109:33.82]It used to take, sometimes, two plus months for you to get something that you ordered.
[109:40.78]Like, from one of these hotline numbers.
[109:44.47]Sometimes it would take months.
[109:45.61]Two, three months.
[109:48.37]Which is crazy.
[109:53.23]Wow.
[109:53.49]Read that fine print.
[109:59.33]Cheers video cassette for $4.95.
[110:01.39]Call- Subscription subject to review.
[110:04.01]Sales tax added with subscription.
[110:06.21]Wait, hold on.
[110:07.61]Men and women in uniform.
[110:09.81]Use your credit card and call- Future three episode videos sent every four to six weeks and are $19.95.
[110:17.09]Each plus- wait a minute.
[110:23.43]So it's $5 plus shipping.
[110:26.17]They give you three episodes.
[110:28.94]And then every two months, they send you three more episodes, but now it's $20.
[110:40.21]How many episodes are in Cheers?
[110:41.75]Can somebody look this up really quick?
[110:43.11]I guess I could right here.
[110:44.45]How many episodes are in Cheers?
[110:45.97]The whole series.
[110:50.11]There are hundreds of them.
[110:51.03]There's like 200.
[110:55.38]There are 273 episodes of Cheers.
[110:58.20]Oh my god!
[110:58.96]So, hold on.
[111:04.46]$20 every- okay, $20 for three episodes.
[111:08.56]So that's- we need some- we need some math here.
[111:11.80]So you'd get 91 tapes.
[111:15.96]It would cost two thousand dollars.
[111:20.48]two thousand dollars for the whole thing and how long would it take for you to get it like over the course of like seven years it would take it would take years they probably wouldn't even be in circulation anymore by the time you got the last episode weirdly enough this is very weirdly enough
[111:49.11]By the time that you are on episode 200 or so, DVDs, I think, have come out by now.
[111:59.13]So you don't need this subscription anymore.
[112:01.63]What were they thinking?
[112:07.21]Maybe they thought that VHS was just, this is it.
[112:09.43]It's VHSs.
[112:11.55]That's it.
[112:13.69]You would need an entire room for your Cheers VHS collection.
[112:17.22]Yeah, it would be almost 100 tapes.
[112:20.43]And I think that would be kind of weird.
[112:23.27]I feel like if I went over somebody's house and they had a wall, just a huge bookcase with a hundred tapes on it, all of it was Cheers, you would walk into that room and go, oh, nice, I got a bookshelf.
[112:37.68]I wonder, what do you got?
[112:38.64]The Great Gatsby on there?
[112:40.12]Oh, what a... Every single thing here is a Cheers VHS tape.
[112:46.11]Every single thing on the shelf.
[112:47.71]Everything.
[112:52.08]Alright.
[112:52.50]I mean, that's... I wonder what these are worth now.
[112:59.43]It's almost $4,000 today.
[113:02.53]Wow.
[113:05.46]And right now, you could probably go watch Cheers on a ton of different services and not have to spend like five grand.
[113:15.24]you probably should go watch it right now even if you bought the whole thing from like iTunes it probably wouldn't cost you even close to what like a couple hundred bucks total maybe if you bought the every single episode on like iTunes but you don't understand you're saving on the first one 4.95 is a steal it would take 10 and a half years
[113:42.72]Call now for your first three-episode Cheers videocassette for $4.95.
[113:46.43]Call now.
[113:48.31]You're in Comedy Central.
[113:58.15]Out on the road?
[113:59.89]This is the number to remember.
[114:03.80]1-800-COLLECT.
[114:05.62]America's least expensive way to call someone.
[114:07.92]Collect.
[114:09.38]Tea, everyone.
[114:10.52]Oh, why, thank you, Mandela.
[114:13.67]Lipton Original.
[114:15.57]Guzzling, gulping, chugging, but never sip.
[114:19.26]This ain't no sipping tea.
[114:23.68]Guys, guys, get a whiff of this.
[114:25.72]What?
[114:27.77]Oh, that's...
[114:48.62]We need to talk about the first one that we just saw.
[114:50.04]That's perfect.
[114:55.22]Okay.
[114:55.42]Yes.
[114:56.28]I'm so happy right now.
[114:58.40]Forget everything.
[114:59.06]Everybody freeze.
[114:59.90]Don't move.
[115:01.22]Nobody move.
[115:01.84]This is really important.
[115:05.02]I don't want anyone to move.
[115:07.42]Freeze.
[115:10.69]Okay.
[115:11.73]I'm telling you right now.
[115:13.35]It's impossible not to enjoy this picture.
[115:19.97]I genuinely don't think you could not enjoy the photo you're about to see.
[115:25.67]Do you know what I'm saying?
[115:32.02]Do you see what I'm saying?
[115:39.34]You can't not enjoy this in some fashion, even if you don't think it's funny.
[115:43.72]Like, this is an enjoyable image to me.
[115:47.14]It kind of is.
[115:50.78]And the best part is you blurred the price.
[115:56.76]Because what is that price?
[115:58.84]What?
[115:59.68]It's cheaper now by how much?
[116:02.00]What?
[116:02.42]I can't see through that blur.
[116:04.76]I wonder what percentage point it's going down.
[116:08.87]Oh, my God.
[116:09.57]Yeah, it's just question marks.
[116:20.64]God, the internet.
[116:21.94]The internet is like so... What a fucking insane place.
[116:27.82]What a wild place this really is.
[116:29.86]There's so much funny things to see.
[116:36.42]So many crazy things to look at.
[116:38.88]This is insane.
[116:39.74]The internet is a cool place.
[116:43.73]Just be careful.
[116:44.25]Careful.
[116:44.91]Careful.
[116:49.25]Make it the stream thumbnail?
[116:53.09]Okay, Grandpa.
[117:01.34]Should I do one too?
[117:02.22]No, there's no dick.
[117:17.72]But this is me reacting to the video of the person reacting to the price cut.
[117:26.63]Okay.
[117:28.41]Here we go.
[117:28.75]Ready?
[117:29.87]So I'm watching a video.
[117:36.38]Was that good?
[117:47.23]That was pretty good, right?
[117:53.55]Go on to the switch screen.
[117:54.81]No.
[117:57.52]Alright.
[117:58.40]We got to break down these last ones we just saw.
[118:00.04]These are important.
[118:03.88]These are very important.
[118:04.78]Hold on.
[118:08.32]I got to move this.
[118:10.36]The last one was weird because it was just three ladies just chugging iced tea.
[118:18.16]Was it a contest?
[118:21.22]I don't know.
[118:21.52]Alright, but here's the next part, right?
[118:32.13]We have... What is this a commercial for?
[118:36.83]He's blowing his breath in this other guy's face.
[118:40.75]Is this for gum?
[118:42.34]Mint?
[118:43.12]Mint?
[118:44.67]You think it's gum?
[118:47.23]What if it's like a steak and cheese or something?
[118:50.75]Or like a sandwich or something.
[118:51.75]Yeah.
[118:52.63]I actually don't know.
[118:53.35]I don't know if it's going to be mints.
[118:55.65]This is a tricky one.
[118:59.73]I actually really don't know what this could be.
[119:05.94]It's probably for mints, right?
[119:07.26]There's no way they would do an ad where he blows like gross hamburger meat breath in this guy's face, right?
[119:15.14]I don't think so.
[119:25.23]Petunia.
[119:26.53]Breathsavers with its cool minty core gives you the ultimate fresh breath.
[119:30.73]Breathsavers.

[174:35.06]Bringing Christmas home.

[175:04.84]Buying holiday gifts at department stores could be a waste of money.

[175:12.58]You can't do that to real money?
[175:13.96]I know, but at least... I mean, why is he doing this?
[175:17.23]I see this shit on, like, YouTube videos and, like, TikToks.
[175:23.39]Why is he doing this?
[175:24.63]Like...
[175:34.21]Oh, that was under...
[175:57.67]a hundred dollars every day right like you don't why would you burn we're a part of your country
[176:25.25]He got in.
[176:35.91]Let's rap.
[176:36.95]Rap things up early.
[176:37.81]Now we've seen it already.
[176:38.89]Music Mart's gigantic holiday season.
[176:40.73]Omaha, easy financing.
[176:42.01]That's a rap.
[176:43.13]They teach who was murdered at the high school.
[176:45.07]They teach who was... They teach... The 60% off, this week only at M-M-M-Music Mart.
[176:49.20]That's a rap.
[176:50.02]Something's out there.
[176:51.38]It has a mind that can reason.
[176:53.18]Something out of control.
[176:54.98]But it's insane.
[176:56.64]They teach who was murdered at the high school.
[176:58.42]To destroy it.
[177:00.42]Why does the dog look interested in that, too?
[177:04.40]As long as he's with the dog, his life is in danger.
[177:07.11]And I say we make a stand right here, right now.
[177:10.60]The dog was like, yeah, I can't believe it happened.

[177:36.69]Little towns in Europe had their own way of knowing the holidays were near.
[177:40.96]It wasn't the decorations or the first magic snowfall.
[177:44.38]It was the appearance of special holiday lockers in every pub and beer hall.
[177:49.48]Today, that tradition lives in America at Coors, introducing Winterfest.
[177:54.75]Sucks that this works.
[177:55.79]So bold, so extravagant.
[177:57.93]We brew it only for the holidays.
[178:00.19]When the new year comes, the Winterfest will be gone, but not the memories.
[178:04.72]I hate how this works.
[178:06.95]I want one of these right now.
[178:08.57]It's just like, I don't even like beer.
[178:15.97]When you, seeing the glasses like foam, I really don't drink it.
[178:21.56]But it's just, I want to drink one of those out of that mug.
[178:24.24]Only that mug.
[178:24.90]I don't want it out of anything else.
[178:27.06]It works every time on me.

[185:05.41]I'll show you how it works.
[185:07.73]You open it up from here, you put a nut in there, and you...

[185:34.37]It won't ever.
[185:35.45]Of course it will.
[185:36.67]There's a story about how it gets all fixed up.
[185:39.05]You'll have to use glue, not a story.
[185:41.61]Come on over here.
[185:42.98]Sit down on Grandpa's lap and I'll tell you a story.
[185:45.09]Alright?
[185:47.19]Now, suppose I tell you that this isn't really a doll.
[185:51.17]It's an enchanted magic prince.
[185:54.69]You'll have to say, once upon a time.
[185:58.52]I'll say it.
[185:59.64]Once upon a time, there was a little girl called, uh... Clara!
[186:04.68]Her name's Clara.
[186:06.62]Clara, just like yours.
[186:07.96]What a coincidence.
[186:09.00]Of course, that's what was her name.
[186:11.11]And it was Christmas.
[186:12.23]And it was a party.
[186:13.07]A Christmas party.
[186:15.09]And it was getting late.
[186:16.43]It always gets late when there's a party.
[186:19.00]And she needed to fill her car with oil.
[186:20.50]Because the next day was Christmas.
[186:22.76]Clara was very tired.
[186:24.34]I think a little bit like you are.
[186:26.56]But she was happy because she had all those toys.
[186:29.46]And the Nutcracker doll, was that her favorite doll?
[186:33.14]Oh, of course it was.
[186:34.74]Did her grandpa break it?
[186:37.24]No, her grandpa wasn't quite as clumsy as yours.
[186:41.18]Alright, now, Clara's parents waved goodbye to their guests, and they went off to bed.

[187:54.75]We at Comedy Central celebrate the spirit of the season.

[202:31.55]Oh, yeah.
[202:33.87]Going to McDonald's, sitting down,
[202:38.25]Eating, like, Big Mac and fries, or even just, like, two double cheeseburgers.
[202:41.57]I love McDonald's.
[202:42.59]I really do.
[202:44.49]It's, like, it's... You know something?
[202:47.23]I'm about to pop off.
[202:49.12]I'm popping the heck off right now.
[202:53.48]You want to know something about McDonald's that I don't like?
[202:57.66]Have you noticed that every McDonald's is starting to turn into a generic cafe?
[203:05.15]Hmm.
[203:07.92]Ronald McDonald has been removed.
[203:09.80]There's no more Grimace.
[203:11.00]There's no more... They just turned... They just made it... They said that they're just making it a just generic cafe.
[203:18.26]Like, come on.
[203:20.90]It's just, oh, everything's, like, clean and modern.
[203:24.32]There's no goofy shit out back.
[203:28.46]It's, yeah, it's just like a black, white, gray, and yellow cube.
[203:38.15]Where's the weird shit?
[203:39.57]I want to sit next to Ronald McDonald on the bench.
[203:42.43]Somebody said, who cares?
[203:48.50]You can batch test me all you want.
[203:52.58]Batch test me all you want.
[203:55.50]If you grew up in the 90s and in the 80s, early 80s to late 90s, McDonald's was a place to be.
[204:06.14]It was just comfortable.
[204:08.93]I only want to see bat chests.
[204:11.83]It was fun.
[204:13.01]It was things to do.
[204:15.69]It was things to play with.
[204:17.48]Okay, child targeted advertisement.
[204:20.36]I liked it.
[204:22.32]It was cool.
[204:24.38]The escapism has been removed.
[204:27.14]It's now like a coffee shop.
[204:30.78]No, I want Grimace to go like with magical hands.
[204:44.94]They do it to re-franchise closed restaurants.
[204:55.95]It went from Chuck E. Cheese to Starbucks.
[204:58.99]Yeah.
[205:00.13]Everything just became a Starbucks.
[205:01.59]Every single store that sells anything that you eat has just been like, oh, we're going to do Starbucks.
[205:07.93]We'll just do Starbucks.
[205:09.55]And just put them everywhere and just turn them into Starbuckses.
[205:14.07]Where's the magic?
[205:21.66]At Christmas time when I was a kid, I always loved the story about the three wise men.
[205:26.60]I used to always picture them as being like Dr. Thomas.
[205:30.10]He was the only doctor that we had up here in these hills, and he used to ride the ridges on horseback taking care of the sick.
[205:36.57]He was a well-educated man, and he could have made a fine living somewhere else, but he loved these people, and he loved the mountains.
[205:42.58]Most of the folks up here just paid him with a live chicken or a sack of cornmeal.
[205:46.90]He delivered me.
[205:48.76]He was our preacher, too, so years later he tried to deliver me from sin.
[205:52.51]Of course, that was a much harder job for him.
[205:55.09]He's gone now, but what he brought to these mountains was a much greater gift than gold or frankincense.
[206:03.71]I'm sorry, when Dolly talks, you quiet down.
[206:12.92]I see your true colors shining through.
[206:18.88]I see your true colors shining through.

[206:57.39]I see your true colors shining through.

[208:57.03]Wait, what?
[208:58.65]I thought the whole thing was Anheuser-Busch.
[209:00.18]It was the horse.
[209:02.78]The big horse.
[209:04.60]The Clydesdale, right?

[209:11.16]Whatever.

[209:54.74]Peter Scolari hosts the Ice Capades 50th anniversary special Thursday.
[210:00.00]The 90s were insane.
[210:06.41]That was like three or four different shows and movies that they put on the same thing on ice.
[210:11.32]Like The Simpsons and these two celebrities.
[210:13.88]And, I don't know, people dressed up in costumes and doing a play.

[211:24.59]It would be unbearable.
[211:30.85]It makes sense.

[211:37.05]Why did I lose my place?
[211:40.75]What happened?

[230:40.25]And now I'm going to be in big trouble.
[230:45.78]That's a classic one, though.
[230:52.23]Oh, shit!
[230:53.38]I remember this!
[230:56.08]I went to high school, didn't do great, still I gotta make more cash.
[231:01.58]Education is what I'm looking at.
[231:04.04]When I get my degree, I will make a bigger salary.
[231:08.23]So where did I do T?
[231:10.43]Which college is right for me?
[231:12.73]I went on the internet and went Education Connection.
[231:17.89]I did this free test.
[231:19.55]I have no idea what this was, I have no idea what it was for, what the product was, no clue.
[231:48.93]They nailed it with this commercial.
[231:52.75]I mean, that was just great all around.
[231:56.07]Whatever ad agency was responsible for this, they have to be swimming in like a liquid gold pool because they probably went on to make even more absolute bangers.
[232:13.69]The song won a Grammy, by the way, really?
[232:23.66]He didn't know it's about colleges.
[232:25.16]I mean, I knew, but I didn't know what it was for.
[232:27.67]It was like, you go on it, and it's like, oh, here, these are the colleges that you should go to, because, like, we're matching majors or something?
[232:33.65]I don't know.
[232:36.07]Wait, did you just lie to me?
[232:37.73]Oh, I was lying.
[232:38.63]Okay.
[232:40.78]I thought it was... I thought you were being for real.
[232:44.94]I believed it, because it made sense.
[232:50.44]Say hello to the...
[232:52.54]Yeah, but they're, oh yeah, why would I not immediately say, what are you talking about?
[232:55.23]They're the Grammy for TV commercial songs?

[236:05.80]Dad buys this.
[236:07.04]He's really excited.
[236:09.06]And after the first, I want to say probably 10 minutes of the first DVD, every single person in the whole room has moved on besides Dad.
[236:19.39]And he's kind of upset about it, right?
[236:24.43]Because everyone's like, oh, yeah, that's fun.
[236:26.01]Oh, yeah, but what about this one?
[236:27.13]This jet, look at this one.
[236:29.24]And I think the whole room might kind of be like, um, this is cool, but how long is this?
[236:36.13]These could be hours long.
[236:38.27]I'll be very honest.
[236:40.85]Planes, jets, they're awesome.
[236:42.45]They're really cool.
[236:44.07]That's really awesome.
[236:46.05]I don't think I could watch like planes flying around for like three, four, five hours straight.
[236:53.26]What is this?
[236:54.76]Is it just like, hey, look, there's planes flying around.
[236:58.60]It's for kids.
[237:04.78]There's a train one.
[237:09.06]They're dad sensory videos?
[237:15.36]Am I just completely getting this wrong?
[237:20.32]Or is this actually just like little kids would be like, look, an airplane, dad.
[237:25.06]Did I get the whole thing wrong?
[237:35.13]That's what I think.
[237:35.73]A CD of jet plane songs.

[238:04.15]Alright, I would watch an hour.
[238:19.93]I would've wanted to play this.
[238:20.79]From the prehistoric past and the limitless future comes Roboraptor.
[238:24.03]Fluid biomechanical motion and three programmable behavior modes make him interactive, responsive, or unpredictable.
[238:30.00]Touch sensors in his head and tail make him powerfully interactive.
[238:32.84]He's doing the Yankee Splanky.
[238:34.74]Vision sensors see you.
[238:36.18]Take control of Roboraptor with a multifunction remote or let him roam free.
[238:40.70]Sensory awareness lets him feel and react with his environment.
[238:44.14]Friend or predator, you decide.
[238:46.36]Roboraptor, a fusion of technology and personality.
[238:49.53]It can bite you?
[238:50.35]It can bite your finger?

[239:02.57]Part reptile, part technology, all added to Roboraptor.
[239:07.62]Trigger his sound sensors to lure him in, and take command with the remote control.
[239:11.96]Feeding Robo-Reptile will tame him, but not for long.
[239:15.22]Robo-Reptile, a fusion of technology and personality.
[239:18.80]Kill mode.
[239:21.43]The eagle screeching.

[240:02.67]I remember this.
[240:03.69]This commercial is on all the time.
[240:05.15]What a great idea.
[240:33.42]Hey Furby!
[240:35.10]Hey Furby!
[240:35.90]Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[240:36.84]Here we go.
[240:41.01]Show me dance!
[240:53.79]That's not what they fucking sound like.
[241:00.25]That is not what, that was dubbed over.
[241:03.71]That's not what they sound like.
[241:24.20]It's a rebrand from, uh, you're thinking of the, I'm thinking of the old ones.
[241:30.04]Okay.
[241:30.54]Well, you know what I meant.
[241:32.89]Find more fun at Hasbro.com.
[241:34.09]Ask a parent first.
[241:36.51]I got to read this.
[241:37.57]Hold on.
[241:51.05]Belly mouth in mod chat.
[241:52.91]I had one of those but never no no I had a Furby but it talked too much and my brother put it in the freezer and it went II for three days and died Good good
[242:21.51]That's so sad.
[242:22.37]That's actually sad.
[242:24.11]That's what that was for.
[242:29.55]Muzzy?
[242:53.76]Hi, I'm David Ward.
[242:55.32]Muzzy is the number one language course for children in the world.
[243:02.08]There's never been a better time than right now to try Muzzy.
[243:06.15]This is, he goes, right?
[243:10.55]There's a version of this, right?
[243:17.97]He goes, right?
[243:23.35]I'm serious.
[243:25.03]I hit that.
[243:25.81]Some of you guys went, yep.
[243:35.29]It was one of the Muzzy commercials.
[243:40.09]Wait, you've got it right here.
[243:41.53]Hold on.
[243:52.64]dude I'm telling you when I say something and I remember something I remember it pretty accurately I gotta give myself credit for that one that was pretty it's pretty good
[244:06.85]To celebrate our anniversary, we'll send you all five original Muzzy languages in one program.
[244:13.87]And you can try Muzzy free.
[244:19.11]For the first time ever, five languages.
[244:21.47]Wrong.
[244:21.83]Spanish, French, Italian, Jerma, and English in one program at no extra cost.
[244:28.45]This is the biggest, most powerful Muzzy ever.
[244:31.38]Remember, kids are open to languages.
[244:33.96]It comes naturally.
[244:35.70]They don't see it as work.
[244:37.44]It's fun.
[244:38.74]I wish I learned a different language.
[244:41.02]Kids love Muzzy.
[244:42.72]And with five languages in one, try Muzzy free.
[244:46.88]What are you waiting for?
[244:49.28]And then, no, that is true though.
[244:51.21]Learning a different language or, you know, learning two or three languages when you're younger, it's so much, your brain is developing and you can just take it in so much easier than right now.
[245:01.78]And I can't do it.
[245:02.92]I just cannot do it.
[245:10.80]You know what?
[245:11.10]It's interesting because I've always heard people kind of talk, you know, by talking to different languages or like, oh, yeah, I know this.
[245:17.36]I know that.
[245:17.82]I know how to speak French.
[245:18.66]I know how to speak Spanish or whatever.
[245:21.02]And they can just go back and forth like that.
[245:25.47]The way the brain works, I'm trying to imagine, like, do you think in the other language or do you translate it first and then say it?
[245:38.48]Do you think in English and then translate it and just phonetically say the words?
[245:44.03]Or can you actually think in Spanish?
[245:46.93]Think in French?
[245:48.25]Think in Swedish?
[245:51.94]I feel like that's hard.
[245:53.34]It depends.
[245:54.00]Both.
[246:07.07]I think in my native language and say it in Icelandic, really.
[246:12.45]Depends on a lot of context.
[246:15.11]Because I'm trying to imagine a world where I would be thinking in a different language and like saying it, reversing it into English or vice versa.
[246:23.06]Like, do you actually start to think in that language?
[246:26.88]Pretty cool.

[251:30.07]I have a few little ones here that I want to do.
[251:32.57]How about this one?
[251:38.44]What is this one?
[251:40.62]Oh, yeah, I want to see this one.
[251:41.92]Did we see this one already?
[251:43.58]We may have seen this one.
[251:45.40]This one's called Yolk Magic.
[251:47.97]Yolk Magic Egg Yolk.
[251:49.45]Did we see this already?
[251:54.53]when it comes to egg whites separating the yolk is no joke messy shells why are you aiming out of the pan that are slow pokes not anymore introducing yolk magic the fast easy way to separate yolks from egg whites watch just squeeze the vacuum force bulb touch it to the top of the yolk and release
[252:13.65]Just like that, you're left with high-protein, low-calorie egg whites.
[252:17.05]Skill issue.
[252:17.67]Now make fluffy pancakes, Belgian waffles, or a delicious egg white omelet and start your day the healthier way.
[252:24.09]Egg yolks are loaded with cholesterol and high cholesterol.
[252:28.98]I'm going to go.
[252:29.48]Don't get me started again.
[252:30.60]I'm about to... Do you want me to spend 10 minutes talking about this again?
[252:38.23]This is horse shit.
[252:41.83]Egg yolks are not bad.
[252:44.50]Yeah, they have cholesterol.
[252:49.68]If you just eat a shitload of egg yolks every single day of your life, eggs, egg yolks have all this stuff.
[252:57.13]Most of the stuff that you want from an egg is from the yolk.
[253:00.56]And there was this thing that happened back in like the late 90s, early 2000s, where it was like, don't eat the egg yolk.
[253:08.34]Don't eat the egg yolk.
[253:08.93]It's disgusting.
[253:09.55]It's terrible for you.
[253:10.35]It's awful for you.
[253:11.11]It can give you heart disease and shit.
[253:14.33]What?
[253:15.09]Eat the egg.
[253:17.05]It's the egg.
[253:18.23]Eat it.
[253:21.58]Now don't eat a hundred of them.
[253:26.54]...diets are at an all-time high.
[253:29.06]Notice how high cholesterol diets at an all-time high causing health risks.
[253:37.94]Where's the part about the eggs?
[253:39.08]High cholesterol diets are the healthier way.
[253:41.93]Egg yolks are loaded with cholesterol.
[253:44.09]And high cholesterol diets are at an all-time high.
[253:47.33]You know what else is high cholesterol?
[253:49.11]All the fucking hamburgers you eat.
[253:53.37]All the shit you eat every day.
[253:55.30]All the steak that you eat every day.
[254:00.74]I don't like how the egg yolk's got a really bad wrap for a long time.
[254:07.65]Why does the omelette look like a tortilla?
[254:10.67]What?
[254:11.15]It does.
[254:19.17]Steak every day?
[254:20.33]I don't know.
[254:21.29]People eat all kinds of shit.
[254:22.80]Start your day the healthier way.
[254:24.92]Egg yolks are loaded with cholesterol, and high cholesterol diets are at an all-time high.
[254:30.02]But with yolk magic, removing them has never been faster and easier.
[254:33.92]Even from inside a fry pan, plate, mixing bowl... If it made that sound, I think it would be cool.
[254:38.27]Now you can stay fit and lean by enjoying a yolk-free veggie scramble, energizing breakfast burritos, or savory quiche Lorraine.
[254:45.53]Fast and easy.
[254:46.87]Yolk magic is a baker's dream.

[254:51.97]Perfect for wholesome muffins, the fluffiest meringues, or scrumptious soufflés.
[254:56.55]And look, you can save the yolks for other recipes.
[255:02.68]What?
[255:05.40]I thought we were... Why are we doing that?
[255:08.04]Why are you not eating them?
[255:10.20]Save the yolks for later.
[255:12.00]I thought we're supposed to not eat these or not use them ever.
[255:20.00]So... so instead of leaning into the like egss are awful, terrible for you don't eat egg yolks they're awful - this product is actually pretty cool.

[262:31.22]Gotta learn sometime.
[262:44.02]alright I think I'm done maybe one more one more what about what's this one we'll try this one one more this one's the spinning cool cafe
[263:10.79]Love the taste of iced coffee, but hate paying expensive coffee shop prices?
[263:15.68]Brew it hot, and that's the wrong way.
[263:17.96]Brew it cold, and you've discovered the right way with the amazing Spinning Cool Cafe.
[263:23.33]The fast, easy way to spin delicious cold brew coffee.
[263:27.17]Look, hot brewing just increases acidity and makes coffee taste bitter.
[263:31.67]But the Spinning Cool Cafe uses crisp cold water and a unique spinning system to draw out the perfect natural flavors from the coffee without the bitterness or acidity.
[263:41.56]With just a spin, you'll create the best iced mochas or fantastic frappes that are always silky, rich, and smooth.
[263:49.50]Plus, cold brewing cuts acidity by up to 70%.
[263:53.12]It's so smooth, you won't even need sugar or cream.
[263:56.70]Simply fill the carafe with water, add your favorite coffee, and spin.
[264:00.64]Why do you need to spin it?
[264:04.63]I've used a cold brew baker a handful of times.
[264:07.11]You don't... You just put the grounds in.
[264:10.48]You seal it up.
[264:11.18]Why does it have to spin?
[264:13.56]Does that do anything?
[264:14.90]brewed coffee in the world and because it's cold brewed it won't get watered down with ice thanks to this press system coffee grounds are easily filtered and held on the bottom cold brew light medium or dark using any coffee you choose the best part your coffee stays fresh and full flavored in the fridge for up to 14 days ice drinks at the coffee shop cost about six I like cold brew but the same but what they don't show you in this commercial and a quarter call now and get
[264:42.57]What they don't show you in this commercial is how much kind of a pain in the ass it is.
[264:47.61]Because you'll do this.
[264:49.41]It takes like... Wait, what did they say?
[264:52.35]14 days?
[264:55.92]That's a long time.
[264:58.62]Cold brew makers are great, but yeah, you guys are saying it already.
[265:01.92]The issue with it is, you do it, you brew it, and you make the amount of coffee you want, and then the thing is sitting on the counter, and you drink it, and you kind of just go, oh, this is a fucking mess.
[265:15.65]And then you have to take the thing apart, clean it, throw all the grounds away, wash the thing, grounds are everywhere.
[265:23.47]It's kind of annoying.
[265:25.47]It's really good, though.
[265:27.81]It's worth it if you really like cold brew.
[265:30.21]But... A lot of cold brew machines or cold brew makers... I wish there was just a better way.
[265:40.50]Right?
[265:41.38]You're lazy.

[267:12.81]$100 value.
[267:13.17]14 days.
[267:21.94]I don't know if I'm one to talk, because I feel like I've put cold brew in the fridge and drank it like a week or two later.
[267:29.55]I feel like I have done that.
[267:31.87]Like, oh yeah, this is still fine.
[267:33.85]It's been like, I don't know.
[267:35.89]It's fine, it's coffee.
[267:39.64]It's not poison.
[267:45.10]That explains a lot.
[267:47.51]Not two weeks, but... I don't know.
[267:50.63]Four, five, six days?
[267:51.99]A few days?
[267:53.35]Five days?
[267:53.98]How long?
[267:54.72]I've probably done it before.

[268:00.84]Well, I don't know.
[268:02.88]Does it?

[268:11.89]Alright, that's it.
[268:13.27]That's all for today.
[268:20.77]That was fun.
[268:21.23]There's only four and a half hours I think is my limit.
[268:25.49]Watching like two Lord of the Rings movies worth of old ads I think is enough for my brain.
[268:32.93]That was really fun.
[268:35.51]That was very, very, very wild.
[268:49.14]Yeah, alright, so what do you guys think?
[268:51.73]You guys want more of this?
[268:52.59]I don't want to overdo it, though, because I feel like it loses the magic.
[269:03.23]I think it's a lot of fun.
[269:05.89]It's cool to look at the way the world functioned and the technology at the time and what people thought was interesting.
[269:13.66]It's cool.
[269:17.22]Please watch Biodome.
[269:20.44]I mean, I don't think I can do that, but I'll ask.
[269:27.24]Do mobile game ads?
[269:28.66]I've actually wanted to do that for a while.
[269:36.39]Alright, so the plan was I was going to play Driver tomorrow, but I do have some very bad news.
[269:43.91]I'm not going to be playing Driver tomorrow.
[269:45.75]I need to set it up.
[269:46.67]I need a little more time to set up.
[269:49.34]We're not doing that.
[269:52.68]Sorry.
[269:59.86]So... That's shocking.
[270:04.96]Do British ads?
[270:07.34]I'll do that.
[270:12.10]Is it just as simple as looking up...
[270:15.73]Uh, 90s British ads.
[270:19.29]The same amount of compilations I'm imagining.
[270:24.27]Do Canadian ones.
[270:27.29]You want me to be a commercial React Andy?
[270:29.93]I can do that.
[270:30.39]The UK is so boring.
[270:45.31]I mean, I don't think there's probably tons of interesting stuff that came out in the UK for ads.
[270:58.25]Yeah.
[271:02.61]Alright.
[271:02.95]So here's the plan.
[271:04.27]I'm kind of doing this like one day off, one day on, one day off, one day on, one day off, one day on thing.
[271:10.59]So the next time you see me, I'll be here on Sunday.
[271:15.07]with hopefully driver and probably something else I'm not I am not gonna beat driver I don't think so I'll be lucky to get 30 to 40 minutes out of that game yeah frog detective makes sense depends on if I get obsessed with driver I doubt it but you know weirder things have happened on this stream
[271:47.93]Yeah.
[271:49.21]Same deal.
[271:50.72]Sus is going to be set for 2.
[271:52.36]Don't be surprised if it happens earlier.
[271:53.78]2023, I'm trying to keep myself more honest on when I start.
[271:59.38]So if it says 2, it could be 2.
[272:02.31]It might also be 130.
[272:03.15]1.
[272:03.49]Could be.
[272:03.71]It is 2023, yeah.
[272:14.45]That was a lot of fun.
[272:15.05]That was really funny.
[272:16.27]It always is.
