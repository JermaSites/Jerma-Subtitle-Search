[ve:60.16.100]

[01:13.25]Hi, I probably sound different.
[01:16.46]The whole room's in a different setup right now.
[01:19.20]Bear with me for like another few minutes while I need to get my drink.
[01:23.04]My phone just died.
[01:24.54]I'm about to fucking throw it into the ground.
[01:27.58]Because iPhone sucks.
[01:29.56]Especially iPhone 6. iPhone 6, you go from 100% battery to like zero in about fucking four hours.
[01:38.35]I'll see you guys in five minutes.
[03:03.79]Alright, let's plug this in.
[03:07.07]Speaking of plug-in, we're gonna be playing, obviously, PSVR.
[03:13.79]A bunch of shit came up for PSVR over the last, like, six months, the last time we've seen it.
[03:18.84]And I'm gonna give it a try.
[03:22.82]So... I'm not gonna be able to see...
[03:28.98]Any chatters?
[03:30.86]I'm gonna be across the room, so I can't read what anybody says, or if anybody subs or bits it.
[03:37.21]Like, I read subs, but you get the idea.
[03:41.85]And with that... I'm not prepared for this.
[03:48.43]I'm not prepared for anything!
[03:49.75]I forgot to get a drink.
[03:52.01]I need to drink alcohol to do VR, otherwise I throw up.
[03:55.73]Is that weird?
[04:02.66]Uh, yeah, so let's move that.
[04:06.22]Get the helmet on.
[04:08.64]We'll start in just a moment.
[04:11.10]Nice, like, fresh dog hair on there.
[04:12.92]That's good.
[04:16.56]Oh, man, this is so dirty, too.
[04:17.92]Hold on a minute.
[04:20.86]This is the dirtiest fucking PSVR headset ever.
[04:24.96]Did you see that?
[04:26.10]It was like... It, like, okay.
[04:30.69]It, like, saved...
[04:32.83]The fucking last image that it was just on.
[04:36.35]And the last image it was on, the webcam, was me fucking angry.
[04:39.74]Did you see that?
[04:40.34]I was like... Because I was.
[04:42.88]I mean, it's true.
[04:45.16]That's so funny.
[04:46.12]The last fucking image that was saved is me fucking, like, angry.
[04:52.56]Alright, let's fucking get this on.
[04:56.61]Do I need, like, fucking shit that I don't want you guys to see around here?
[05:01.13]There's a bunch of dirty fucking cups over here, but whatever.
[05:06.60]Alright, no.
[05:07.58]My address isn't written back there, right?
[05:12.28]Alright, here we go.
[05:15.96]Again, I'm not going to be able to see a fucking thing anybody says.
[05:20.10]We're just going to play.
[05:23.10]Let me get this going.
[05:24.32]Let me see this.
[05:28.73]I gotta make a tweet.
[05:30.36]Very important.
[05:31.06]Hold on.
[05:31.92]Very important.
[05:32.40]Gotta make a tweet.
[05:36.54]I'm like, why am I, like, hiding?
[05:38.30]I'm, like, hiding to fucking make sure you guys don't see anything.
[05:42.85]You like the new haircut?
[05:43.85]It's not new.
[05:44.39]It's just the old one grew out and I didn't care to get it cut again.
[05:48.89]Microphone's up here, by the way, so that's why I probably sound a little weird.
[05:56.50]So, we're gonna play, uh, I don't know anything about it.
[06:01.02]God.
[06:04.49]I need, like, a drink.
[06:06.39]Because I will throw up.

[09:32.16]Am I doing a good job killing time while two of the other games download?
[09:36.19]How am I doing?
[09:37.55]I'm gonna teach you guys a little secret drink here.
[09:39.19]This is what I like to drink sometimes when I, you know, when I get antsy.
[09:43.45]Uh, those of you that are of legal drinking age, let's move this over here and, uh... Hold on, wait a minute.
[09:53.40]Wait, wait, wait.
[09:54.04]This is important.
[09:55.40]This is important.
[10:14.64]Alright, that's enough.
[10:17.62]Alright, so here's a little tip.
[10:22.73]I think I gotta stand up for this, right?
[10:24.57]Move this up.
[10:29.45]No, Papa.
[10:30.91]Can you guys see me?
[10:31.72]If I, like, stand over here, does my fly up?
[10:33.24]Yeah, good.
[10:34.14]We're good.
[10:35.70]Okay, so, like this, right?
[10:37.52]Alright.
[10:40.10]Like that.
[10:40.82]That works.
[10:42.16]Maybe a little.
[10:42.96]You gotta maybe go a little higher than that.
[10:44.48]Like that, right?
[10:48.83]Hey, quick.
[10:49.29]Everybody talk about how short he is.
[10:52.35]Quick.
[10:52.77]Everybody talk about how he fucking how tall he is, right?
[10:56.51]Because we haven't heard that one a thousand times before.
[11:00.82]Gosh.
[11:01.36]Oh, wait.
[11:01.62]I forgot to tell you how to make a drink.
[11:02.64]Hold on.
[11:04.46]This is gonna ruin my fucking baby hairs up here, but whatever.
[11:09.62]Alright, so.
[11:11.78]Uh, here.
[11:13.43]First what you gotta do is first you gotta murder somebody and take their fucking skull.
[11:18.09]And you gotta pop the top of their skull open.
[11:19.79]Everybody's skull... Everybody's skull has a fucking little, like, spigot on the top of their head.
[11:26.48]So when you get their skull, you take the fucking spigot that's on the top of their head.
[11:31.14]By the way, that's covered by hair.
[11:32.42]That's covered by hair, by the way.
[11:34.22]If you didn't know.
[11:35.68]All of us have that.
[11:36.38]If you put your hand up here and you move your, like, finger around...
[11:40.86]We all have this.
[11:42.66]Just a... That's enough.
[11:46.19]That's enough.
[11:47.51]That's enough.
[11:48.27]Just enough.
[11:52.15]That's it.
[11:52.51]That's enough.
[11:55.83]Fucking just kidding.
[11:59.97]Anyways, if you are of the legal drinking age, which is 21 in the United States, then you may join me.
[12:06.15]If not, then...
[12:09.61]Enjoy your soda.
[12:10.65]Because it's still just as good.
[12:14.97]And this is some, like, watermelon seltzer bullshit.
[12:17.22]Who knows?
[12:18.30]Dump it in there like this.
[12:19.16]Make sure you get a fucking... I was a bartender for ten years.
[12:21.16]You think you can fucking pull that off?
[12:22.82]You try.
[12:25.04]I'm stalling so much because I, like... VR, like, gives me a fucking headache.
[12:30.66]How many people... Have we lost a thousand people yet?
[12:33.90]Or, like, there's still people there?
[12:34.89]Okay, good.
[12:38.93]Alright guys, I can only pretend to fucking do this for as long as I can, right?
[12:44.53]So, here we go.
[12:45.21]We're gonna play Star Trek Bridge Crew.
[12:46.95]How the fuck you do that?
[12:50.59]Every so often I'm gonna pop out, grab a little fucking... Alright, I gotta get this so it's not gonna fucking kill me.
[12:58.20]Hold on.
[13:00.70]There we go.
[13:04.08]There we go.
[13:04.86]Alright, I need my move controllers, mom.
[13:09.50]I believe I need both of them.
[13:12.62]So how's this gonna work?
[13:13.44]You're gonna activate this one and activate this one, right?
[13:17.63]Yeah, that's me.
[13:18.35]Yeah, that's me.
[13:19.63]What do I mean?
[13:20.65]Which one's, like, dead?
[13:22.47]What even fucking... Motion control of battery low.
[13:24.55]Oh, go fuck yourself.
[13:25.43]Which one?
[13:33.23]Apparently this one's battery's low.
[13:34.47]It's charging all day.
[13:35.35]That means it's, like, broken.
[13:36.31]But whatever, I got this.
[13:37.09]It's cool.
[13:39.01]Alright, let's get ready.
[13:42.85]Did you guys see my, like, fucking belly?
[13:44.85]Alright, uh... How do you do it?
[13:48.62]You go like this, right?
[13:49.34]Alright, Star Trek Bridge Crew.
[13:51.68]I'm gonna put the headphones in.
[13:52.74]Here we go.
[13:53.16]I'm getting immersed now, so I don't know what the fuck you guys are saying.
[13:56.40]So, good luck.
[13:58.36]Hopefully it's nothing bad.
[13:59.68]What are we doing?
[14:00.52]What the fuck are you doing?
[14:02.16]Yes, play Star Trek Bridge Crew now.
[14:07.51]Alright.
[14:07.67]Alright.
[14:13.48]This is right.
[14:14.14]This is left.
[14:17.90]So I'm actually a... I'm actually a fairly big fan of Star Wars.
[14:23.02]So this is going to be pretty cool, I think.
[14:25.10]What does it want me to do?
[14:29.97]No, you can move over here.
[14:36.81]Which button is this?
[14:41.59]Cannot display the menu.
[14:42.79]What?
[14:44.49]Yeah, I get you.
[14:46.73]Oh, that is not correct.
[14:48.59]How do I move it?
[14:49.35]It's a holding option, right?
[14:53.43]There we go.
[14:54.37]Check your surroundings.
[14:55.15]Are they clear of things you might bump into?
[14:56.75]But best results, five to seven feet.
[14:58.70]Okay.
[14:59.66]Let's check.
[15:00.30]Are we sweating already?
[15:02.82]Fuck, we are.
[15:03.56]Are we really?
[15:04.22]I just put this fucking t-shirt on.
[15:08.42]Okay, let me check.
[15:13.79]We're good.
[15:15.53]All clear, right?
[15:19.17]Shut up.

[15:27.36]Wait, does that say no?
[15:28.64]Okay, that just said no signal?

[21:11.40]My crew is assembled, and we're preparing to disembark on our expedition to the trench.
[21:15.84]Before we depart, however, Starfleet Command has asked us to complete one final exercise to confirm the Aegis' fitness of mission ahead, and undoubtedly to test the readiness of her captain and crew.
[21:26.27]They're testing me.
[21:31.29]Or what?
[21:33.45]Okay.

[23:41.49]Nope.
[23:41.89]We have to warp to a different system.
[23:44.59]Go to the button to the left of that.
[23:46.03]That's impulse.
[23:48.27]And then one more is warp.
[23:54.12]Okay, where are we going to warp to?
[23:55.28]Yep.
[23:56.50]To that one.
[23:56.94]He's already got the settings and headings set.
[23:59.80]Gamma Hydra?
[24:02.42]Yes, sir.
[24:04.28]You got it.
[24:06.22]Tell me to engage.
[24:09.33]You are ready to warp, sir.
[24:11.47]Engage!
[24:13.83]I like the energy.
[24:15.87]Whoa, Jesus!
[24:22.03]INTENSE RIDE!
[24:24.92]I did it.
[24:25.62]Are there swears allowed in this game?
[24:28.64]Are there swears?
[24:30.08]Yeah, you will do.
[24:31.10]Okay, well, I will refrain from swearing.
[24:34.09]I'm picking up a distress signal, Captain.
[24:36.67]We got a distress signal.
[24:38.59]I think I just unplugged my motion controller.
[24:40.73]My vessel has lost all power, and our life support systems are nearly exhausted.
[24:45.32]We have a crew of six.
[24:46.74]I request that you take us aboard your ship as soon as possible.
[24:49.88]You keep looking at me like that, I am going to fucking wring your neck.
[24:53.90]What's going on over here?
[24:56.10]We're going to scan that ship.
[24:58.17]Go ahead and scan that ship.
[25:00.05]Do you have the local map open?
[25:03.07]Yes, I do.
[25:04.49]Okay.
[25:05.21]On your right hand, on the right arm, press the very left button.
[25:11.23]Oh, no, on your right arm.
[25:13.12]No, the other one.
[25:16.00]Turn that off.
[25:19.46]Okay, so right hand, left button, you got it.
[25:23.75]Yeah, so that'll give you the, uh... Okay.
[25:26.39]The objectives.
[25:27.58]Rescue crew of the Talinian.
[25:30.04]Okay.
[25:31.12]So, do you want to handle Chalicord?
[25:33.42]Okay, so... I'm locking.
[25:36.56]Uh, I want to take about two swift shots to the gun.
[25:40.12]Now we have to transport, uh, like six of them all.
[25:43.61]Hey, like that's what I'm gonna do to you if you disobey the captain again!
[25:48.17]Nice.
[25:51.32]I wasn't talking to you.
[25:52.44]I was talking to the guy down there.
[25:53.92]Sorry about that.
[25:55.22]That's fine.
[25:58.28]So how else would you like me to ruin your experience?
[26:00.21]I'm sorry.
[26:00.83]You're doing well.
[26:02.99]Don't worry.
[26:03.93]For a first game, you're doing well.
[26:06.93]Okay, so we need to take this ship out, right?
[26:10.91]No.
[26:11.79]That's fine.
[26:13.41]I'll wait for orders to come in.
[26:15.76]Okay, let me sit down.
[26:17.20]I am sitting down.
[26:17.92]Hold on.
[26:21.10]We have a priority message incoming from Starfleet Command.
[26:23.93]If I can hang up on him, he's a fucking annoying asshole.
[26:27.27]There you go.
[26:29.51]So you see the flashing button?
[26:31.37]I do, yeah, I got it.
[26:34.37]Okay, what is it?
[26:36.33]You know, I... Okay.
[26:37.67]Opening channel.
[26:39.23]There you go.
[26:39.69]Captain, we've lost contact with one of our survey vessels, the USS Nicholson.
[26:44.57]You're the closest ship to their last known position.
[26:47.28]We need you to locate the vessel and render any aid they may need.
[26:51.00]We're sending their last coordinates to you now.
[26:52.72]I don't know if I can handle this.
[26:54.42]I don't know if I can handle a pilot or something like this before I've done anything like this.
[26:57.92]Can you just load two torpedoes and unload them just so we have them cocked?
[27:02.10]Yeah, they're all set.
[27:03.39]Thanks.
[27:06.43]I'm an experienced tech.
[27:07.63]Don't worry.
[27:11.40]Okay, let's take a look.
[27:15.82]Alright.
[27:16.30]Hey, you got that under control already, huh?
[27:18.44]Yeah, I do.
[27:19.18]I'm learning.
[27:21.18]Good job.
[27:22.16]Thank you.
[27:22.72]With a little bit of help, it goes a lot smoother.
[27:25.60]You guys are very good crewmen, by the way.
[27:27.70]Yeah.
[27:30.90]So, yeah.
[27:31.56]Earlier, Darth?
[27:33.88]Darth?
[27:36.22]Engineer?
[27:36.94]Scylla?
[27:38.14]What?
[27:39.15]Remember earlier I was telling you if you keep the speed under 4,000, it'll reduce the signature?
[27:45.51]So if we're trying to stay hidden, keep it at 4 pips instead of 5.
[27:51.05]That way it's easier for Tactical to keep it under 4.
[27:55.35]It's a lot for Impulse right now.
[27:56.77]I can't do anything about it, but I will keep it under 4 for sure.
[28:01.53]Other times, yeah, keep it up.
[28:03.31]As captain, I demand a rock, paper, scissors with Darth Bob right now.
[28:07.23]Excuse me.
[28:07.79]Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
[28:10.41]And the captain always wins.
[28:11.45]If we get too close, I'll be attracted to our hull, and the damage could be severe.
[28:16.02]Give me some power to phasers.
[28:18.10]Rock always wins.
[28:21.04]Power to phasers, you got it.
[28:22.80]That is nothing.
[28:24.28]Okay, that's not the phasers.
[28:25.18]Oh, okay.
[28:29.74]Thank you.
[28:32.12]There we go.
[28:33.71]That's good.
[28:35.35]Jack Nicholson.
[28:36.01]We gotta go rescue Jack Nicholson in his latest movie set.
[28:40.35]Agreed.
[28:41.07]Now that was really funny.
[28:42.99]Heading at zero, heading towards Plasma Court A. Yeah.
[28:48.62]Very nice.
[28:49.02]Yeah, that's something else that's very useful is, uh,
[28:57.32]That's true, you know, where the hell has he been?
[29:00.18]I think he's just gracefully retired.
[29:02.32]You know, I like you.
[29:04.10]I like you.
[29:04.90]I like you.
[29:06.41]Who, me?
[29:07.55]Yes.
[29:08.75]Thank you.
[29:09.07]I take great pride in speaking.
[29:12.81]But it is not a Federation frequency.
[29:15.51]It looks like a civilian vessel needs assistance as well.
[29:20.33]Follow Plasma Coolant Trail to locate... Gentlemen, we got a signal.
[29:24.78]Aegis, according to my engineer, our engines are locked in some sort of malfunction cycle.
[29:33.06]If we could temporarily override them, I think we can fix the problem.
[29:38.06]What?
[29:39.84]Well, to me... You're telling me I've been able to sit down this whole time and I haven't...
[29:49.93]The whole game is a sit-down thing, man.
[29:51.99]You've been standing?
[29:52.81]That's crazy.
[29:53.51]I know, what a dumb campus.
[29:55.07]It's like trying to walk around the bridge.
[29:58.90]I kind of was.
[30:06.42]So, uh... Did you get a scan on that anomaly by any chance?
[30:11.31]Why don't I do that right now?
[30:13.15]Thank you.
[30:14.47]So, how come the other people are... We've got a blue shirt guy over there.
[30:18.34]I mean, he's the only guy.
[30:19.16]Who's our science officer?
[30:20.80]Science officer, come on.
[30:22.14]No, so we got Han Solo over there.
[30:23.76]Moderate.
[30:24.22]How do you do that?
[30:24.68]That's obscuring, I think.
[30:26.56]I'm such a bad captain.
[30:28.85]I deserve this.
[30:43.17]Should I go for colon B or, uh... Go for colon C. This is so stupid.
[30:49.20]Oh, that's colon C. I thought it was B for a second.
[30:57.68]I'll go through the anomaly bucket.
[31:02.04]Our scanning range is lower because we're in the anomaly.
[31:06.10]Oh, true, true, true, true.
[31:09.18]Alright, gentlemen, I want you to take a look at me.
[31:10.53]This is what I want to do.
[31:11.27]Is there a rocket launcher on my shoulder?
[31:12.79]The next enemy we face, kaboom!
[31:14.99]You know what I mean?
[31:16.57]Oh, yeah.
[31:19.11]Don't worry, we'll be facing something soon.
[31:23.24]We're still in the anomaly?
[31:25.68]Uh, no, we're... It's hard for me to kind of skate around it without completely going... Oh, we can get out of it.
[31:33.95]We don't need to stay in it.
[31:35.74]Engineer, can I get a little speed, please?
[31:38.52]I put it up to four instead of three.
[31:41.04]Engage.
[31:42.34]Thank you, sir.
[31:46.34]Remember to aid the civilian vessel.
[31:48.87]Okay.
[31:49.69]Mm-hmm.
[31:55.01]On.
[31:56.31]Honestly, you could even throw it at five, because there's no traffic in the area.
[31:59.89]No one's going to...
[32:04.95]So I'm taking a look at the, uh, the Frankahedron.
[32:06.71]Wait, hold on.
[32:08.93]I believe our lost ship is showing on sensors now, Captain.
[32:12.35]We're being hailed.
[32:13.87]There we go.
[32:14.95]We're being hailed.
[32:16.42]This is the USS Nicholson.
[32:18.40]Our vessel is severely damaged and leaking radiation.
[32:21.60]Most of my crew escaped, but a few of us are trapped in a forward compartment.
[32:25.20]Okay.
[32:25.72]I need you to transport us off the ship.
[32:27.12]Let's get them out of there.
[32:27.86]Get them out of there.
[32:28.54]Very good job.
[32:34.14]I'm blocking right now.
[32:35.26]Engage!
[32:37.32]Once we're done that, get us to a safe distance of, uh, 30 kilometers.
[32:42.24]Yeah, I see them right there.
[32:43.66]Yeah, I do see them.
[32:44.42]Energizing in five seconds.
[32:45.90]I see them over there.
[32:46.78]Sector B and Sector 6.
[32:49.70]The hull's at 100%, that's good.
[32:51.94]What system are you playing on?
[32:54.08]Five.
[32:55.74]Uh, Nintendo Switch.
[32:58.50]Not really.
[32:59.56]Uh, the PlayStation 4.
[33:01.52]Okay, then I don't know how to help you.
[33:04.67]Five.
[33:05.69]Five?
[33:06.49]Yeah, if you press on your left trackpad, if you press right on it, you can see how it's set.
[33:11.37]Okay, I got it.
[33:11.95]Yeah, I can see.
[33:15.38]Are they all off?
[33:16.20]Yeah.
[33:17.64]Oh, wow.
[33:17.94]That's actually really cool.
[33:18.80]What a fun game, actually.
[33:19.92]What a really actually fun game.
[33:21.20]Yep.
[33:22.95]Alright, so get us some distance away from that or else it's going to blow us up.
[33:26.37]What, the ship?
[33:28.07]It still has a marker on it on my screen.
[33:32.56]We have to blow it up as well.
[33:34.92]Ah, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
[33:36.50]Okay, so you need me to press any of these buttons here?
[33:41.02]Hit red alert for fun.
[33:42.52]Okay.
[33:42.88]Just for funsies.
[33:44.67]Gentlemen, we have a red alert!
[33:48.89]Ah, funsies.
[33:51.31]And it stays on until the mission is completed.
[33:54.32]Perfect.
[33:55.90]I'm just kidding.
[33:56.52]I'm not going to do that.
[33:57.34]I'm not a dumb captain.
[33:58.48]I'm just kidding.
[33:59.02]It is going on.
[34:02.82]Too much for a loop over and over again here.
[34:04.86]See, I did that.
[34:05.76]I pressed the red alert button and cannons fired to the right.
[34:08.20]Alright.
[34:09.76]I'm going to destroy it with a torpedo from here.
[34:11.88]When was the last time you guys had a fucking grapefruit?
[34:14.17]You know what I mean?
[34:14.65]Like a big one.
[34:16.50]I'm not into grapefruits at all.
[34:18.12]Alright, really?
[34:18.73]Probably when I was like four or five.
[34:20.67]Danielson, what is going on here?
[34:22.89]Look outside and look at the torpedo heading towards the ship.
[34:26.45]There's a torpedo heading towards the ship at 18 kilometers western.
[34:30.89]Yep.
[34:31.73]Oh, it hit us anyways.
[34:33.09]Damn.
[34:33.94]What's the hull at?
[34:35.92]We got the hull at 98%.
[34:36.78]We're okay.
[34:38.54]Alright, good.
[34:39.50]Oh, 98?
[34:39.74]Okay, that wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.
[34:41.18]We're going to be fine.
[34:45.19]I'm gonna scan the target ship.
[34:47.43]It's okay.
[34:47.75]He just dropped a little bit of tar on us.
[34:49.08]We're gonna be fine.
[34:52.58]Warning.
[34:53.46]Environmental hazard detected.
[34:55.26]What?
[34:58.58]It's obscure.
[35:00.62]It's not dangerous.
[35:01.74]Say that one more time.
[35:02.79]There's an anomaly.
[35:04.55]See the anomaly on the right?
[35:05.97]That we're patrolling down.
[35:07.33]Yep.
[35:07.69]I see.
[35:07.95]Yep.
[35:09.03]That's the disturbed, but it's only obscuring.
[35:11.89]It's not damaging to the ship.
[35:15.41]Okay.
[35:15.77]I feel you.
[35:16.15]Okay.
[35:16.37]Go.
[35:16.75]Yep.
[35:17.13]I see that's a very large anomaly.
[35:21.59]Nice.
[35:21.89]Very good shot.
[35:23.95]Beautiful shot.
[35:25.59]Who shot?
[35:26.01]Who did that?
[35:26.62]Who did that?
[35:28.16]That was you?
[35:30.28]Promoted.
[35:31.40]You get three extra raisins at dinner tonight.
[35:35.50]Promoted.
[35:37.05]What's our next objective?
[35:38.63]What's our next objective?
[35:41.13]There we go.
[35:41.67]There we go.
[35:48.91]Impulse to Section 10.
[35:50.33]Current objective.
[35:50.97]Selected objective from... Oh, I just... Sorry about that.
[35:55.62]Okay.
[35:56.12]Impulse to Section 10.
[35:59.06]Section 10 is somewhere in here, right?
[36:04.36]Alright, over here.
[36:06.51]10.
[36:07.01]Okay.
[36:07.29]Section 6.
[36:08.07]No, that's not where we need to go.
[36:17.42]Section 10.
[36:20.59]Okay.
[36:21.31]Are we going to the nebula?
[36:27.35]I'm not sure.
[36:28.97]Come on, give me a break.
[36:31.66]Give me a fucking hand here.
[36:33.56]We're doing the Kobayashi now.
[36:35.00]Okay, cool.
[36:36.32]Kobayashi.
[36:39.52]Is this a competition to eat 75 hot dogs?
[36:42.76]It is to save 300 people's lives.
[36:46.26]That's equally as important.
[36:48.74]Yes.
[36:50.06]Hot dogs and people.
[36:51.28]Yes.
[36:51.88]In equal measure.
[36:53.02]Very much so.
[36:56.12]Captain, I'm getting something on the distress channel.
[36:58.08]Putting it on screen.
[37:00.58]What is it?
[37:00.92]More power to the phasers?
[37:20.39]Objectives updated.
[37:24.59]Let's take a look.
[37:27.75]What the fuck up, Spock?
[37:32.63]We do what I say as a captain.
[37:35.33]Treaties.
[37:36.62]If I had the paper in my hands right now, that's ripping the treaty in half.
[37:40.84]Engage.
[37:44.30]Excellent.
[37:45.84]Perfect.
[37:46.90]Excellent shot.
[37:49.20]Taking out his mic, bro.
[37:54.82]Yo, you okay over there?
[37:57.52]Me?
[37:58.49]Yeah, I'm fucking in.
[37:59.89]So, what, uh, wait a minute.
[38:02.37]I'm not leaning forward yet.
[38:04.09]Wait a minute.
[38:04.51]Because otherwise it gets too close and then I can't touch all the buttons.
[38:09.17]Wait, how do you do regular finger?
[38:10.65]How do you do that?
[38:12.12]I think it's only on the Vive.
[38:14.69]Oh, I'm on the shitty PSVR.
[38:19.53]I don't get to have fun.
[38:21.29]I'm on the PSVR.
[38:22.71]PSVR is fun.
[38:24.98]PSVR is a piece of trash and we all know it.
[38:28.30]I don't know about that.
[38:31.02]It's a $500 fucking... Start taking them off with teleporters.
[38:39.00]Teleporters.
[38:40.28]Okay, select target for more detailed information.
[38:45.53]You you you you you were working over there, so are you and so are you you not so much I Do as I'm told oh do you do you?
[38:58.43]Put your hands in there.
[38:59.11]I'm in the engineer put your hands in the air I'm an engineer.
[39:01.39]Oh, are you?
[39:01.63]Where did you go to school?
[39:12.07]That's okay.
[39:12.49]We don't need shields first.
[39:13.45]In the game, I'm an engineer.
[39:14.85]That's what I mean.
[39:16.39]We're role-playing right now.
[39:17.91]Where did you go to school?
[39:18.77]At Starfleet.
[39:19.95]I want to know the number.
[39:20.57]There we go.
[39:22.13]Give me full power to phasers.
[39:23.66]Okay.
[39:23.78]Get it.
[39:24.42]Get it.
[39:24.58]Get it.
[39:25.68]Get it.
[39:41.89]You gotta get it!
[39:44.47]Get him!
[39:46.72]What are those?
[39:49.04]Torpedoes.
[39:50.22]Did you hit?
[39:50.64]Uh, they will be hitting.
[39:55.10]I made the mistake of targeting his engines and shields.
[39:57.71]No, no, no.
[39:58.07]We don't make mistakes.
[39:59.17]We made calculated misinformation.
[40:00.91]It's okay.
[40:04.09]We don't make mistakes here.
[40:05.97]None of us make any mistakes.
[40:07.67]Right, John?
[40:13.60]Keep up the scanning on them.
[40:15.86]They're teleporting.
[40:17.88]I've got two batched already.
[40:19.14]It's third right here.
[40:21.83]Energizing in one second.
[40:27.37]You're doing it.
[40:27.91]Don't worry, man.
[40:33.94]This guy over here is laughing about a little bit.
[40:37.14]Keep it going.
[40:38.12]Okay.
[40:39.48]The closer you get, the faster it'll scan and transport you.
[40:42.40]Okay.
[40:42.76]Well, usually, like, within 10 kilometers is, like, the fastest range you'll get.
[40:47.15]But I'll go up to it.
[40:54.47]Hull is at 98%.
[40:56.76]With 27 torpedoes left, that's very good.
[40:58.60]Very good job, guys.
[41:00.78]Oh, shit.
[41:01.12]I should have this turned on.
[41:05.74]Oh, no.
[41:06.06]It's a Star Destroyer.
[41:07.44]There we go.
[41:08.89]Who knows we're here?
[41:09.41]Okay, full power to shields.
[41:11.77]I mean to, uh, not shields, phasers.
[41:15.29]I took the red alert off because I didn't like the lighting atmosphere.
[41:17.50]It was giving us all like a headache.
[41:23.90]So which one of these, which one of these two bugs is the enemy?
[41:27.60]Take another one on the right.
[41:29.70]That one.
[41:30.08]Nice.
[41:34.19]Whew.
[41:37.21]Let me just crack my knuckles there.
[41:38.35]I feel like I did a lot of work there.
[41:40.37]You can keep running the thing if you want.
[41:44.26]I am.
[41:44.62]Oh, I am.
[41:46.30]I'm not stopping.
[41:49.98]Scratch my beard a little bit down and do lots of work.
[41:54.79]Reroute power into phasers from other things.
[41:57.47]Captain's job is very important.
[41:59.09]I got a very itchy chest.
[42:05.15]Reroute power into
[42:06.93]Reroute all power into phasers if you can.
[42:09.47]Phasers, got it.
[42:11.47]We've lost power on deck five.
[42:15.67]We've lost power on deck five.
[42:17.05]Where's that?
[42:17.79]Let me take a look at it.
[42:18.77]Gentlemen, don't worry.
[42:19.41]I've handled pressure before.
[42:24.44]Five seconds and they'll be dead.
[42:25.68]Let's get a magnify here.
[42:28.00]This hull's at 10%.
[42:28.98]Okay.
[42:33.06]Where's our hull at?
[42:34.24]Our hull is at 93%.
[42:34.94]We're still in good standing.
[42:38.99]There you go.
[42:39.53]Re-wrap power out of phasers or overloads.
[42:45.55]But keep it at 5 still.
[42:47.24]Yeah, hit reset all wraps.
[42:48.90]You got it.
[42:49.28]Sorry, I'm kind of cackling for it.
[42:55.22]You got it.
[42:56.90]That's how you learn.
[42:58.52]Excellent job.
[43:00.26]All power to shields.
[43:01.98]No, no, no.
[43:02.48]All power out of shields.
[43:07.10]What school did you go to again?
[43:09.64]You said you went to Starfleet Academy?
[43:11.00]Which one?
[43:13.46]Which base?
[43:14.62]You didn't go to my base.
[43:17.16]I would have seen you there.
[43:20.34]You would have been part of the food fight of 1971.
[43:21.88]I got hit in the face with a meatball sub.
[43:26.28]You know how fucking much that hurts?
[43:29.31]Why is this not disrupting anymore?
[43:32.53]What?
[43:35.85]What?
[43:38.73]Oh, my God, it didn't work.
[43:39.53]Oh, no.
[43:42.75]It's alright.
[43:43.25]We got plenty more shots to take at this fucking flying insect.
[43:52.18]That's a direct hit.
[43:54.64]Yeah, but it didn't work properly.
[43:56.92]It's okay.
[43:59.58]Oh, shit.
[44:01.33]Ow!
[44:01.73]My chair just fucking shocked me.
[44:03.87]Oh!
[44:04.23]Oh!
[44:06.78]Shields going to zero.
[44:08.02]Shields going to zero.
[44:09.14]Hull is at 88%, 87%.
[44:12.02]All shiftips go.
[44:13.42]Speed ahead.
[44:14.48]Shields are full.
[44:15.59]Shields are at 100%.
[44:16.53]Now we've got torpedo 26 to 85% hull.
[44:20.25]Whew.
[44:22.25]Man, is this what adrenaline feels like?
[44:26.57]Sorry, we can't pull anybody off right now.
[44:29.60]We're not going to drive into that guy, are we?
[44:31.50]Shields down.
[44:32.90]We've got 85% that we're going to be fine.
[44:35.87]Alright, you can keep, uh, pulling them off the ship.
[44:39.36]As a crew.
[44:41.54]We have been through way worse than this.
[44:45.40]I grew up with all of your fa- Guys, if we die, I just want to make sure you know.
[44:56.98]I accidentally- I've been the one eating the shit in the fridge with everybody's name on it, I'm sorry.
[45:03.62]It's been me.
[45:06.98]I know it says your name on it, Ted, every time, and I eat the fucking food every time.
[45:12.43]I never bring a lunch.
[45:13.93]I should start doing that.
[45:15.65]I'm a fucking captain, for Christ's sake.
[45:17.25]I don't even bring my own lunch.
[45:20.29]Ridiculous.
[45:22.51]Oh, shit.
[45:22.91]I think those have been good.
[45:27.17]Shield's going on.
[45:27.91]A little late, but still.
[45:32.53]I was almost done with the scan, too.
[45:35.41]That's alright.
[45:36.35]That's alright.
[45:37.53]Oh, the 69%.
[45:37.91]Shield's back up.
[45:40.91]Good game, though.
[45:42.73]We're at 69%.
[45:43.63]The game's not over.
[45:45.00]Congratulations, Captain.
[45:45.66]No, it is.
[45:46.00]Kobayashi died.
[45:46.80]You and your crew have just completed the Kobayashi Maru simulation.
[45:49.94]We're going to get a pretty good score on that.
[45:51.62]I know it's not easy to face a bad win situation like that.
[45:54.64]Excellent work.
[45:55.14]But it's a necessary test, both for Starfleet and for yourselves.
[45:59.98]I think we all have a better idea now of the decisions you'll make when there's no obvious right answer.
[46:06.04]Based on your overall performance, I'm not only clearing the Aegis for Operation Distant Shore, I'm recommending that you lead the expedition into the trench.
[46:16.39]Wow.
[46:17.27]Yeah.
[46:20.21]Very nice.
[46:20.71]Very nice work, guys.
[46:21.61]That was very, very fun.
[46:23.64]And I don't think they can hear me anymore.
[46:30.78]Gonna get a great score.
[46:33.90]We got a good score.
[46:36.74]Success.
[46:38.31]We did it?
[46:40.05]We did it.
[46:40.85]Hold on, let me just rip all the hairs out of my head from the VR helmet.
[46:44.97]Good job.
[46:47.83]Mission complete.
[46:48.73]Success.
[46:49.15]Playtime, 25 hours.
[46:50.25]That was a lot of fun.
[46:53.13]Eight torpedoes fired.
[46:55.16]Only 66 hot dogs.
[46:56.92]66 hot dogs.
[46:57.50]That's really good.
[47:00.56]That's actually pretty close.
[47:02.30]We almost beat his record.
[47:04.30]How many people did we pull off, did we say?
[47:08.77]I think it was 66 hot dogs.
[47:11.07]That's how many we ate at the carnival.
[47:14.83]Well, guys, it's been a blast.
[47:17.15]Take care.
[47:17.55]That was very fun.
[47:19.28]I wish you all the best of luck in the land of Starfleet Command.

[53:11.95]There we go.
[53:13.76]It's got a good feel to it.
[53:14.88]Is that a bad guy that we just killed?
[53:18.36]He's in a bear trap.

[54:29.47]Don't get too close.
[54:38.76]Wait, what did I just do?
[54:41.70]Okay, that's how you do it.
[54:42.53]You gotta get really close and shoot him right in the face.
[54:49.40]How do I move?
[54:49.74]Oh!
[54:50.04]How do I turn around?
[55:20.33]You happy now?
[55:21.85]There we go, that's good.
[55:22.37]Didn't have to go down like this, you know?
[55:24.11]You could have sat down, had a nice cup of coffee, talked it through.
[55:28.07]Easy.
[55:28.25]But no.
[55:31.97]Well, I guess we're done here.
[55:33.67]Let's head out to that bridge I saw downstream yesterday.
[55:38.21]Oh, let's go to that bridge you saw downstream yesterday.
[55:44.32]How do I need to know how to turn around?
[55:47.49]It's gotta be like a turn around, right?
[55:48.95]Besides like me turning around.
[55:55.11]Oh my God, how do I turn around?
[55:58.19]How do I turn the fuck around?

[56:50.86]What the fuck is going on right now?
[56:52.86]Open the door.
[56:59.52]Push the door away.
[57:09.49]That's how you do it, apparently.
[57:13.25]What the fuck?
[57:17.39]Door physics.
[57:18.57]The game's not bad.
[57:19.31]It's not...

[57:24.22]I'm enjoying it.
[57:26.16]I am getting hot, though.
[57:29.38]I am getting hot.
[57:31.68]Not bothered, but hot.
[57:39.28]How much longer are we going to be on this one, do you think?
[57:40.76]Hello?
[57:44.01]What the fuck is going on here?
[57:50.80]Shut up stop shooting stop shooting oh My god, I like I've worn a vive for like 20 minutes.
[58:00.83]I've worn a psvr for fucking 20 minutes I've worn a fucking oculus for 20 minutes The 20 minute time period where you got to get this thing off your fucking head is like the psvr wins stop I haven't shot the gun and now this is like attached to my ear.
[58:16.07]Oh

[58:39.14]Hey, would you like some cords for breakfast?
[58:41.90]Because that's what you're getting.
[58:43.54]A lot of them.

[59:14.78]Hey, Freddy, come on.
[59:18.60]That was so lame.
[59:21.20]That was like the lamest thing I've ever heard somebody say in a video game.
[59:25.84]Oh, so damn hot.
[59:28.73]Oh my god.
[59:41.50]Oh, so hot.
[59:47.76]This is fucking great.

[60:13.45]No, put your hands over here.
[60:15.37]Someone's broadcasting something, but you weren't.
[60:21.25]My immersion's fucking ruined.
[60:24.61]Damn it.
[60:24.99]Alright.
[60:27.31]Think, think, think.
[60:28.90]I need to find another radio.
[60:30.66]I gotta get to the source of this.
[60:36.54]I didn't expect that to fucking happen like that quickly.
[60:40.94]What the fuck?
[60:53.36]Magnetize?
[60:54.12]That guy came out so fast, like why was he fast that he could knock down the whole thing?
[61:08.08]That was a load of shit.
[61:15.42]I'm seeing a lot of nexts.
[61:16.52]Well not yet.

[61:26.26]I ain't gonna next it in 10 minutes.
[61:36.05]Let's actually get to the first boss.
[61:37.97]How does that sound?
[61:39.05]That sounds terrible.
[61:39.79]I don't want to do that.
[61:41.98]Why do I want to do that?
[61:42.74]I don't want to get to the first boss.
[61:45.57]Let's get the ammo in here.
[61:47.81]Okay, there we go.
[61:48.59]Now I'm gonna win.
[61:50.01]He's gonna say the thing about how hot this person is again, right?
[61:53.48]His fucking voice is so loud it hurts.
[61:59.74]Who's he even talking about?

[62:30.85]Ammo, right here.
[62:52.59]It just disappeared into the ground!
[62:54.84]It just disappeared into the ground!
[62:58.60]It just disappeared into the ground!
[63:00.34]Give me that!
[63:03.16]Hey, a radio.
[63:09.99]Alright, let's see if this still works.
[63:15.08]Here it comes.
[63:15.46]Here it comes.
[63:16.32]Oh, wait.
[63:17.48]I should check out that radio.
[63:19.64]Someone's broadcasted something, but where?
[63:28.87]Damn it.
[63:29.21]Alright.
[63:31.55]Think, think, think.
[63:33.11]I need to find another radio.
[63:34.23]Stop doing that.
[63:35.69]I got to get to the source of this.
[63:45.54]GTA Online character.
[63:47.16]Nice dodge.
[63:59.32]Basketball.
[64:07.54]Fuck it.
[64:08.26]We can't get the basketball.
[64:09.82]I wanted to shoot a fucking hoop and my hand is over there now.
[64:24.39]Nothing in here?
[64:29.47]Checkpoint.
[64:32.77]Come on!
[64:43.26]Ammo.
[64:52.44]Get out of here.
[64:53.64]Get out of the way.
[64:59.33]No.
[65:03.59]That's so stupid.
[65:10.46]Where even am I standing in my own house?
[65:12.38]I don't even know.
[65:22.72]Right through the helmet.
[65:23.96]That's worth a hundred points.
[65:28.54]I'm actually, this is like kind of fun.
[65:35.75]What?
[65:36.07]This fucking thing.
[65:55.01]It's so annoying.
[65:57.42]Next.
[65:57.78]No, not yet.
[65:58.57]50 bucks, remember?
[66:04.53]That's a decent one.
[66:05.93]That's a decent one.
[66:07.37]You're of 21 age.
[66:08.05]Go ahead and crack one open for me.
[66:15.96]At least we're right here.
[66:17.18]I'm not giving up yet.
[66:18.40]Not yet.
[66:20.48]I shoot that fucking gun again.
[66:21.92]And, like, it's so hard to put this back on without hurting myself.
[66:24.74]Okay.
[66:24.88]Okay.
[66:27.35]Get those bullets again.
[66:28.39]Why?
[66:32.51]Why would you ever make me switch hands if you have the same button?
[66:36.35]The same button is open stuff.
[66:43.05]Get it open.
[66:43.69]Get the fucking thing open before I start to scream bloody murder.
[66:50.90]I'm just like mashing my hand into my microphone right now.
[66:54.92]Where am I?
[66:56.44]Stand here.
[67:01.58]Okay, get the fuck out of my way.
[67:03.09]Alright, not gonna happen again.
[67:07.39]Let's go.
[67:12.75]Almost happened again.
[67:15.60]Let's just get to the next checkpoint.
[67:16.68]Forget it.
[67:37.00]I just peeled my skin off.
[67:44.87]There's a guy coming here.
[67:46.17]Where's this guy?
[67:51.09]Oh my God.
[68:01.73]Where am I?
[68:02.61]What is going on right now?
[68:03.51]I'm like stuck in the door.
[68:04.51]I'm inside the door.
[68:08.13]I'm in the door.
[68:15.04]Get the fucking door off me.
[68:16.50]Get out of here if you're not going to die from that.
[68:31.87]Fuck this game.
[68:32.59]Look at all these cars.
[68:33.89]Yeah, look at all these cars.
[68:34.65]Looks like they all went running from a horde.
[68:37.72]They did.
[68:38.24]They probably did.
[68:38.88]And there's a police car right here.
[68:40.44]New weapon?
[68:42.62]Well, speaking of the bastards... Nice!
[68:58.32]Nice jump!
[68:59.14]Give me the fucking ammo!
[69:00.22]We gotta go.
[69:09.88]Oh shit, that's like a super effective
[69:41.56]Just go around, go around.
[69:47.34]How do I?
[69:54.27]Anything?
[69:54.55]I don't know what any of that stuff is.
[69:59.13]I don't want it.
[70:03.95]Bullets?
[70:10.30]Please, God, save me from this nonsense.
[70:26.29]Bye!
[70:27.01]That's it, we're done with this game.
[70:30.13]See you later.
[70:33.69]I'm gonna go to the next one.
[70:42.60]Fucking awkward ass... Okay.

[73:54.71]That was like fun though.
[73:56.05]I can see why people play that.
[73:57.11]Let's see how long this goes.
[74:04.77]I can't even use it.
[74:05.73]We're going to have to stay on Bridge Crew apparently.
[74:07.57]Because I can't even change game.
[74:11.73]Alright, you want like a Twitch feature?
[74:15.41]Let me just put the name of a game here, even if the game is not in the database.
[74:19.75]Because otherwise I can't change games.
[74:23.07]Come on, Twitch.
[74:24.10]What's going on there?
[74:26.04]Let me look at the bits first.
[74:27.52]Slipstream.
[74:28.32]Oh, not Slipstream.
[74:29.28]Slipstream.
[74:30.90]Thank you, Sergeant Jetstream for the $5.
[74:33.14]In all my years watching your stupid endeavors, I've never laughed as hard as I had watching you roleplay Star Wars.
[74:38.90]But don't mind me having a laugh about it.
[74:40.44]Well, thank you.
[74:41.69]Thanks for the $5.
[74:42.59]Eggplant, thanks for the bits.

[74:57.09]You're going to fucking kill me.
[74:58.43]Well, I never told you to drink.
[74:59.45]I just said if you're of age, and you're allowed to.
[75:02.11]But thank you, you lost.
[75:03.19]Party Crabs, thanks for the $3.
[75:04.15]I think I said that before, but here we go.
[75:08.99]Let's go, let's play the Bellows VR.
[75:10.96]This is a fucking scary game.
[75:12.18]I don't know why I'm doing a scary game.
[75:14.08]I'm gonna like burn through all these in like fucking, I'm looking forward to playing one of these in particular though.
[75:23.53]This one special game that I can't wait to play.
[75:27.21]Alright, I'm gonna get back in here and let me just drink some of my drink.
[75:30.55]Oh, my fucking webcam's not even on.
[75:31.85]What the hell am I doing?
[75:33.05]I'm a piece of shit streamer.
[75:41.12]I had the thing on, and then I had the thing off.
[75:43.05]Look what this does to my hair, though.
[75:44.41]Like, for real.
[75:45.03]Look at this.
[75:46.27]It, like, fucking tears the hairs out of my head.
[75:48.13]What the fuck was that?
[75:53.49]I do have Job Simulator.
[75:54.73]I didn't get to play it yet.
[75:55.69]Maybe I'll play that.
[75:56.37]I don't know.
[75:58.33]Okay.
[75:58.81]Let's get back here.
[76:01.77]You can see my ugly ass face.
[76:05.39]I'm obsessed with my hair.
[76:06.37]Yeah, because I'm fucking losing it.
[76:08.89]I'm Irish.
[76:10.07]We lose our hair.
[76:10.93]That's, like, what we do.
[76:11.83]That's, like, what we do.
[76:14.13]I have Irish blood in me.
[76:15.33]That means in the next, like, five years, it's fucking all gonna be gone.
[76:17.86]You're gonna be just, like, a bald motherfucker in five years.
[76:23.68]Until Dawn?
[76:24.74]Shit.
[76:25.14]I forgot to start that.
[76:26.10]Ah, well, maybe we're gonna have to do that another time.
[76:28.08]I have it purchased, but I just had to download, like, fucking, like, 15 games or something over the last, like, two days, so...
[76:36.67]Bald, bald, bald, bald.
[76:39.13]Pause and resume downloads if it can go faster.
[76:41.79]Okay.
[76:43.69]This looks actually pretty interesting.
[76:45.11]This, uh, Farpoint.
[76:46.51]This is like a full-on video game.
[76:48.71]Could be fun.
[76:51.43]We still have this shitty VR PlayStation Worlds thing to do.
[76:54.03]I have Job Simulator.
[76:55.47]I have Special Delivery.
[76:56.45]I got this Air Force Special Ops Nightfall.
[76:59.07]We got a lot to do tonight.
[77:00.71]Uh, it's gonna take us a little while.
[77:03.65]But let's open up the Bellows.
[77:05.87]By the time Bellows is done... Come on, PlayStation.
[77:08.11]What the fuck?
[77:09.61]Get up there.
[77:12.63]Okay.
[77:14.49]I would appreciate it if you would move the fuck up there.
[77:20.63]I don't want to do it.
[77:22.57]Okay.
[77:22.83]We're going to check out the game manual.
[77:29.42]Okay, there we go.
[77:31.26]The Bellows.
[77:32.56]What?
[77:33.17]Honestly, what is going on right now?
[77:36.12]This is so sensitive.
[77:38.42]Okay.
[77:40.96]The Bellows.
[77:42.76]The name of that game was Arizona Sunshine.
[77:47.08]It was fucking dumb.
[77:48.62]You know, whatever.
[77:51.25]Okay.
[77:52.79]Let's go.
[77:54.69]See you on the flip side.
[77:59.93]Good thing I don't have to work till... VR hard... This might be fucking... This might be an immediate next, by the way.
[78:04.65]This is probably not gonna be good.
[78:06.99]But, you know, we can at least try.
[78:08.67]Set up PlayStation VR.
[78:09.67]You'll not be able to proceed without a VR headset.
[78:11.66]Please press the X button once your PlayStation VR is connected.
[78:14.02]Alright, let me just check another scene for this, and we can get going.
[78:20.07]And yes, by the way, that is Crystal Skull Vodka.
[78:22.66]It's Dan Aykroyd's vodka.
[78:24.86]Of Ghostbusters fame.
[78:27.32]It's very good.
[78:28.56]If you like vodka, I don't necessarily like it, that's why I buy Crystal Skull, because it's good.
[78:33.32]Okay.
[78:51.28]Press the X button once you are connected.
[78:55.70]I need my headphones too.
[78:59.11]This is X, right?
[79:03.83]Look at interactables and hold the X button to select the button below.
[79:09.36]This is the right button.
[79:12.56]Okay, I need to look this up because this is a fucking mess.
[79:17.44]Hey, what about those cords?
[79:18.32]Oh, fucking cords.
[79:19.36]Remember Jerma was fucking yelling about cords earlier?
[79:21.46]Cords.
[79:22.66]Cords.
[79:24.44]They're everywhere.
[79:25.28]There's fucking cords everywhere.
[79:32.39]Okay.
[79:33.43]There's the left one.
[79:34.25]Here's the right one.
[79:37.79]Wish me luck.
[79:39.31]I wish you all the same.
[79:50.31]Look here.
[79:56.81]Hold X. That's loud.
[80:00.75]Hold options or start to reset your position and rotation.
[80:03.78]Okay, so that's... Please use the button below to go to the main menu.
[80:12.47]This is fucking loud as shit.
[80:19.54]That's better.
[80:23.56]The bellows part one, ghost manner.
[80:25.12]The bellows part two, motion sickness vignette.
[80:28.04]Creates a black ring around the eyes during movement to help with motions.
[80:31.80]I was just like actually puked.
[80:34.22]I almost actually threw up on camera.
[80:36.80]Not because of anything to do with this.
[80:37.98]That was weird.
[80:44.89]Okay, ghost manner.
[80:48.34]Would you like to play?
[80:49.00]Yes, we're gonna do the tutorial.
[80:51.06]Because I don't fucking know a god dang thing about any of this shit.
[80:55.39]I can't even hear myself think, by the way, because this is so loud.
[80:59.15]We're not gonna get very much content, comedy-wise.
[81:01.51]Alright, hold on, I gotta center this.
[81:09.06]Use the button to move.
[81:10.40]Movement direction is determined by pointing the left PlayStation Move controller.
[81:15.14]Try moving into the smoke.
[81:17.04]Okay.
[81:22.07]Wait, what?
[81:23.79]What the fuck was that?
[81:27.55]What?
[81:35.08]What?
[81:38.00]What's fucking happening right now?
[81:39.64]I'm like... How do I like turn my body?
[81:48.31]Press square and triangle to rotate the camera.
[81:50.57]Okay, there we go.
[81:52.47]Better.
[81:55.15]Use controllers to interact with blue highlighted objects.
[81:58.67]Press and hold circle to go back to menu.
[82:03.82]I know how to do this.
[82:08.18]Every time.
[82:10.16]Okay, so just move forward.
[82:11.60]Okay.
[82:19.30]I actually have to hold on to this.
[82:24.03]Alright, we got it.
[82:25.49]We know how to move around as a human.
[82:28.35]As a fucking, just a single human.
[82:39.48]We good?
[82:40.72]Let's go, come on.
[82:50.18]This is a fucking scary game.
[82:51.74]I, like, I, this is great.
[82:57.64]Fucking great, a scary game.
[83:04.24]Hey, whoa, lightning.
[83:07.58]Whoa, lightning.
[83:09.10]I can't see, what is that?
[83:09.91]A fucking mad doctor?
[83:11.93]Get him out of here.
[83:18.25]Okay.
[83:23.17]It's like just pitch black in here.
[83:26.17]I can't see anything.
[83:29.11]Somebody in the room with me right now.
[83:30.71]Okay.
[83:31.05]No, that's not.
[83:31.60]Alright.
[83:34.24]God, this is hard to fucking move around.
[83:48.21]It's so dark.
[83:49.71]It's too dark.
[83:51.51]It's not even like funny dark.
[83:53.03]It's like I can't see my fucking hands in front of my face.
[83:57.05]Can I grab this door?
[84:02.11]I think it's locked.
[84:04.51]Look at me.
[84:04.87]I'm just like, I can't see a thing.
[84:06.89]I can't see fucking anything.
[84:08.27]Let me fucking fix this.
[84:09.49]Let me fucking fix this.
[84:13.15]God.
[84:18.82]I got my hands in the air like, just don't kill me.
[84:26.08]I gotta go in this door.
[84:26.90]I wonder how dark it is for you guys.
[84:37.13]Don't open it.
[84:43.75]What?
[84:44.59]What's going on?
[84:45.69]Oh, they made it even more dark.
[84:49.52]Well, good for you.
[84:50.50]Thanks.
[84:52.10]Thanks for making it even more dark for me.
[84:53.94]And now I got like fucking... I got like nail polish on now.
[84:58.66]Somebody just came over here and scared me and painted my nails.
[85:02.96]Good.
[85:04.01]Thanks.
[85:04.93]I like the shade.
[85:14.10]This actually kind of sucks.
[85:16.44]I want this in my right hand.
[85:17.39]I want it in my right hand.
[85:19.37]I can't put it in my right hand.
[85:28.53]Why am I doing this?
[85:29.41]I fucking hate this VR scary game shit.
[85:36.53]Somebody's gonna scream at me in like five seconds.
[85:53.08]I actually like that.
[85:54.30]I knew it.
[85:55.00]I knew you were gonna scare me, you fucking dumb game.
[85:58.28]Watch out for the floating paintings.
[86:02.88]What?

[86:03.66]There's a guy!
[86:04.14]There's a guy?!
[86:04.57]I thought there was a guy.
[86:10.53]Not a guy.
[86:11.37]Not a guy.
[86:11.79]Just like a floating seat.
[86:13.63]Just a vase.
[86:14.73]Just a door.
[86:16.82]We're okay.
[86:24.69]Damn it.
[86:25.34]Fuck this.
[86:27.85]And it's so dark too.

[90:48.99]No, I, like, ripped the fucking hill on.
[90:52.31]I gotta, like, wipe this off before, like, it disgusts anybody.
[90:59.92]Holy shit.
[91:01.72]That's the biggest scare I've ever had in my life.
[91:05.88]Do I even have, like, a napkin down here?
[91:09.84]The ghost polished your nails and then cut them off to agonize me.
[91:16.78]Alright, we're good.
[91:21.14]Alright.
[91:21.88]Let's get back to it.
[91:24.34]This fucking scary game.
[91:30.51]That scream was good.
[91:31.59]Well, I hope it was because it was fucking terrifying.
[91:37.17]It's still bleeding.
[91:38.01]Who cares?
[91:40.51]You think I give a shit?
[91:41.79]It's like a little... It's one of those little, like, baseline of the fingernail cuts that, like, I have... It's alright.
[91:47.41]I'll be fine.
[91:49.33]No, I'm fine.
[91:50.21]I'm good.
[91:50.99]I'm good.
[91:52.86]I'm a man's man.
[91:54.12]I don't need any of that shit.
[92:00.26]Okay.
[92:02.26]Let's do it again.
[92:04.56]Is the webcam too big?
[92:07.68]Shrank it a little?
[92:09.10]How's that sound?
[92:10.91]Let's go.
[92:12.27]I need my hands back.
[92:16.29]You know, you like see clips of that happening to people on stream sometimes and you laugh at it.
[92:20.71]It's like, that's funny.
[92:21.73]That fucking dumb shithead doesn't even know his like friend or his girlfriend or his wife is coming up behind him to scare the shit out of him.
[92:29.38]Let me tell you how it's like.
[92:30.98]Let me tell you what it's like when it happens to you.
[92:34.28]I thought, for real, I actually thought, I thought the game...
[92:39.87]had, like, something on me.
[92:41.55]Like, I thought I put something on my body.
[92:47.34]I was certain that this was part of the game, and I was part of some new technology that I wasn't fucking aware of before.
[92:59.10]Are we good?
[92:59.36]Can you hear me?
[92:59.84]Can you see?
[93:00.14]Can you fucking... Okay.
[93:02.88]I thought I was part of a new fucking technology experiment.
[93:05.81]I thought all the shit I've talked over the years for, like, PlayStation, Microsoft, Nintendo... One of those fucking employees, like, got wind of my shitty stream and was like, Oh, this guy thinks he's so funny talking shit about Ubisoft.
[93:18.69]Let's, like, really fucking do biofeedback on him.
[93:21.65]I don't know.
[93:22.15]I have no idea.
[93:22.81]What am I supposed to think?
[93:23.55]I don't even want to play this anymore now.
[93:28.99]The scariest thing... That's not scary.
[93:32.10]This is not scary compared to what just happened to me.
[93:45.47]You can't pretend, man.
[93:46.65]Like, there's no pretending with this shit.
[93:48.85]It's VR.
[93:50.33]This isn't just, like, a scary little shitty, like, indie game.
[93:53.41]You know, it might be, but I, like, have full depth perception.
[93:57.18]So it scares me.
[93:58.48]It does.
[93:59.22]You put it on.
[94:00.32]You put on the helmet, and you tell me how you feel when something jumps into your face in real life.
[94:04.44]Somebody here?
[94:05.10]Somebody in here?
[94:06.18]Nope, that was me touching the microphone.
[94:07.70]We're good.
[94:20.70]I sit in the fucking dentist chair now.
[94:22.16]This is great.
[94:24.64]No, I don't.
[94:25.34]I'm just going to keep moving.
[94:30.95]I'm going to be paranoid for the rest of the stream.
[94:33.65]Is there like a fun, goofy, like basketball kids game I can play now to like make sure I don't feel like this?
[94:40.51]What's going on?
[94:45.18]Whose hands are those?
[94:47.52]Is that a mirror?
[94:48.14]That's a mirror.
[94:55.05]Where's my face?
[94:58.09]Oh.
[95:02.18]What am I supposed to do?
[95:03.48]There's a person there now.
[95:05.44]There's a person in the mirror, but the person in the mirror is not there.
[95:09.00]It's dark.
[95:10.24]There's a guy in the mirror!
[95:11.06]A guy coming at me in the mirror!
[95:18.47]Fuck, man.
[95:19.75]Am I bleeding still?
[95:20.61]Yeah.
[95:22.39]pray the price you pay for the price you pay for Twitch content come on the price you pay for Twitch content speaking of prices that people paid thank you tub Tucker for the $5 Boston man child streamer found dead wearing VR head shit set at hands of even smaller girl thank you for the $5 your donation is much appreciated
[95:52.67]I'm just going to warn you guys.
[95:58.65]I'm going to do that a lot.
[96:02.38]I want it with this hand this time.
[96:07.50]This is just fucking amnesia.
[96:08.88]Somebody just decided to make amnesia in first person.
[96:11.24]That's all this is.
[96:17.52]Hey, remember that game that was fucking terrifying?
[96:19.30]Let's do it in first person now, and let's do it with full depth perception in VR.
[96:24.67]I've talked a lot of shit, but this game's like actually kind of scaring the fuck out of me right now.
[96:38.03]Because I know shit's coming, but I don't know when.
[96:39.65]You know what I mean?
[96:46.01]I'm sprinting down this hallway.
[96:49.22]There he is.
[96:49.62]I talked a lot of shit about this game.
[96:55.83]I talked a lot of shit about this game.
[96:59.43]You heard me.
[97:02.19]You heard me talk shit.
[97:04.91]You're seeing... Who is this person?
[97:22.84]God damn it.
[97:24.70]I think there's a new game to play.
[97:28.28]I think we've got a new game to play, guys, right?
[97:30.36]There's like five other games to play.
[97:36.92]That laugh was pretty shitty.
[97:38.24]The laugh was not... The laugh was shitty.
[97:42.08]That was like some guy's brother doing a laugh into a microphone when they get... Give me this fucking thing.
[97:48.26]I'll show you how we do things.
[97:51.75]No, I can't grab it.
[97:53.64]This cannot be grabbed.
[98:01.66]He's gonna go... Okay.
[98:08.58]Motherfucker's gonna be right behind me.
[98:11.90]Guaranteed.
[98:12.36]Is somebody turning my lights off?
[98:30.30]What the fuck is happening right now?
[98:36.05]Don't you fuck with me right now.
[98:38.03]You told me you weren't gonna do it.
[98:42.61]Don't you fucking dare.
[98:44.51]I will be so angry.
[98:46.77]Do not turn these... We still have to turn around.
[98:56.64]Look, I still have to turn around in the game.
[98:59.70]When I turn around in the game, there's going to be a guy behind me.
[99:02.90]Is everybody ready?
[99:04.66]I hope you're all ready, because there's going to be a guy in my face, and he's going to go... And it's going to be like... Okay, there he is.
[99:11.52]See?
[99:11.88]There he is.
[99:12.28]There he is.
[99:14.48]He's right there somewhere.
[99:15.93]Somewhere over there.
[99:16.65]I just got a hair in my mouth from my own head.
[99:26.09]VR horror games.
[99:29.54]Where's the world come to?
[99:32.76]Science has gone too far.
[99:35.74]It's too much.
[99:37.42]Science has gone way too fucking far.
[99:39.21]Everybody's in the bathroom here, right?
[99:44.81]Fucking goddamn scientists coming up with virtual reality.
[99:56.14]Remember when Super Nintendo, when this shit wasn't possible?
[99:58.82]Remember when the scariest thing in Super Nintendo was like... I don't even... See, the scariest thing in Super Nintendo... There wasn't even Resident Evil 1 back then.
[100:12.09]I don't have the key.
[100:21.75]There's gotta be somebody behind this fucking dirty curtain.
[100:25.54]No, it's not.
[100:31.58]Where is it?
[100:32.08]It's so dark.
[100:33.76]This is so horrible.
[100:34.80]Am I locked in here?
[100:44.57]Is the key in the toilet?
[100:47.60]The key's... There's the key.
[101:08.40]I knew it was coming, but it's so much worse than fucking VR.
[101:12.94]Fucking VR changes everything.
[101:15.23]VR changes everything.
[101:18.83]Fuck off.
[101:21.55]Get the key in there.
[101:24.57]Get that fucking key in that socket and turn it.
[101:27.47]Make sure I'm in the right spot.
[101:36.82]You give me this game on Steam with a keyboard and mouse, I'm not going to be scared.
[101:41.92]It's not a scary game.
[101:43.86]It's a little odd.
[101:45.20]It's a little abnormal.
[101:47.24]But it's not scary.
[101:48.56]It's scary because I can see it in real life.
[101:52.00]It's a fucking baby.
[101:55.04]Cool.
[101:56.52]You took the baby from Toy Story with the spider legs and you just cropped out the spider legs.
[102:04.17]Fuck off.
[102:05.58]My fucking banana hands.
[102:12.02]There's got to be something.
[102:13.26]What's the purpose of this whole game?
[102:15.38]Anybody know?
[102:17.55]Has anybody ever played The Bellows on PlayStation PS Now?
[102:22.27]No, PlayStation Store?
[102:23.19]Can I get that stick?
[102:30.05]No, of course not.
[102:36.84]bottle of whiskey holy shit look at this thing that's fucked up let's keep going ah god the music is like changing is there a guy in there
[103:09.98]What is that?
[103:10.96]Is that a saw?
[103:13.53]Somebody there?
[103:14.53]I think there's somebody there.
[103:18.09]It's like a bat person.
[103:23.11]I'm about to next this game.
[103:25.65]Okay, there is like a... Look at this guy.
[103:27.87]That's like a bird fucking alien liquor person.
[103:32.76]I can't open this door.
[103:34.08]Of course not.
[103:34.54]This fucking virtual haunted house dog shit.
[103:43.99]I'm done after this.
[103:45.55]Once I get in this fucking door, I'm done.
[103:49.90]This isn't like Resident Evil or like Resident Evil 7.
[103:52.58]At least I had a gun.
[103:53.38]I have no means of defending myself.
[103:58.00]It's just a bunch of scares.
[104:09.93]I can't go this way.
[104:16.12]What am I supposed to do?
[104:17.17]Where?
[104:18.15]Where will you have me go?
[104:23.29]There's a crawling on the wall.
[104:30.14]I really don't want to keep going, but I have to.
[104:32.18]I have to see like what it is.
[104:33.62]Yeah.
[104:46.06]It's okay now.
[104:47.16]It's okay.
[104:47.84]It's over.
[104:50.04]No one will hurt you anymore.
[105:05.03]Where's my candle?
[105:08.41]Get the fuck out of here.
[105:10.55]Everything stopped.
[105:11.09]There's gonna be a guy.
[105:12.49]There's gonna be a guy.
[105:13.21]There's gonna be a guy right here.
[105:14.36]There's gonna be a guy.
[105:23.46]Huh?
[105:31.81]There's a person here.
[105:34.13]Fuck you, game.
[105:42.40]Get the fuck out of here.
[105:44.10]Get out of here.
[105:48.78]Get out of here.
[105:49.90]We're out.
[105:50.34]We're out.
[105:50.74]That's it.
[105:51.38]That was fun.
[106:09.83]It's like the biting of Isaac.
[106:12.15]Mother noises.
[106:21.04]Those goofy screams.
[106:22.76]Funny joke screams.
[106:26.96]He doesn't have the straps around his waist.
[106:28.91]Unsafe.
[106:30.21]Waist?
[106:30.67]What do you mean waist?
[106:31.45]Like this?
[106:32.51]That's not going to do shit.
[106:35.21]Fucking twitch.tv.
[106:36.05]Alright.
[106:37.25]Did I miss anything?
[106:37.81]No, I didn't miss anything.
[106:38.45]Okay, good.
[106:41.20]It's different in VR.
[106:44.26]Trust me when I say that.
[106:46.36]It's not the same.
[106:48.62]It's different with a fucking VR helmet.
[106:50.16]Alright, we're going to keep going.
[106:52.91]I'm intrigued.
[106:53.49]This is not bad.
[106:54.21]I mean, this is goofy and kind of shitty.
[106:56.57]But I think this was like $9.
[106:57.33]So hold on.
[107:00.27]Let me put this back on correctly.
[107:01.75]Let me take another drink.
[107:02.57]I just want to re-chat for a minute.
[107:05.69]Job simulator?
[107:06.49]I mean, we've got plenty of time, man.
[107:13.15]That's a pretty good Wilhelm scream that I did.
[107:17.27]Okay, where am I going here?
[107:20.45]Where are my hands?
[107:21.17]What's going on?
[107:21.81]Where am I?
[107:23.88]Hello.
[107:26.34]This way.
[107:27.34]There we go.
[107:27.76]Over here?
[107:33.34]This way.
[107:37.65]Next room and we're done.
[107:42.16]Are my hands the right way?
[107:44.32]They are.
[107:51.20]Okay, let's go.
[107:51.88]I don't know where we're going, but we're going.
[107:56.76]I could use a little bit of juice here.
[108:04.92]Horror games.
[108:05.75]They're all the goddamn same.
[108:08.39]All they do is just raise your blood pressure.
[108:11.07]It's not healthy.
[108:14.55]There should be a Surgeon General's warning on the back of these boxes.
[108:24.12]What?
[108:26.54]You know, we have Surgeon General warning on cigarettes.
[108:29.78]We have a Surgeon General warning on fucking alcohol.
[108:33.20]No Surgeon General's warning on horror games.
[108:36.49]You better start doing it now.
[108:38.37]Because people are seriously going to die.
[108:42.28]Once VR gets intense enough where like everything doesn't matter in the world around you, you get so engulfed, people are going to die.
[108:49.20]People are going to have a heart attack.
[108:50.86]You're going to give it to old grandpappy.
[108:52.62]He's going to be like, what's this virtual reality?
[108:54.46]Oh, that's so cool.
[108:55.50]He's going to see this jump scare and you're going to kill your grandfather.
[108:59.10]Don't kill your grandfather.
[109:00.88]Give him a Surgeon General's warning.
[109:06.22]Do you want a dead grandfather on your hands?
[109:16.63]What was that?
[109:18.01]What was that like fucking Mario piranha plant?
[109:24.32]Okay, I like this game now.
[109:26.36]This game was like dumb, but like, okay, I like this game.
[109:28.80]I do.
[109:29.98]This game is fucking great.
[109:31.20]Let's see where I was before.
[109:42.47]Any more like fucking piranha plants?
[109:47.73]Haunted house, I hate this shit.
[109:50.89]I'm glad this is the only scary game I actually have for tonight, because fuck this.
[110:04.78]Do I turn around and run?
[110:05.60]Am I supposed to turn around?
[110:06.84]He's going to be right in my face.
[110:07.72]Everyone get ready.
[110:08.28]I'm going to be ready.
[110:12.76]Where do I go?
[110:17.34]He's gonna be right in my fucking face!
[110:21.64]Here he is.
[110:23.14]I can hear his heartbeat.
[110:26.06]Oh, I missed it!
[110:30.40]I missed the jumpscare because I was turned around.
[110:32.36]Is that the end of the game?
[110:45.77]I beat the game.
[110:47.11]Ow, fuck, I just cut my hand again.
[110:51.53]I missed the final jump scare of the game and I beat the game.
[110:57.12]I beat the game?
[110:59.24]Oh, was that the intro?
[111:05.08]Shit, I gotta like clean this hand.
[111:12.61]Okay, that was part one.
[111:14.60]Part two is the hospital.
[111:18.42]I actually have to clean my hand.
[111:22.61]Give me one minute.
[111:24.09]Be right back.
[114:10.69]Alright, we're back.
[114:12.83]It's just in a weird spot where it's right on the fucking hairline of my fingernail.
[114:18.53]So what do you guys think?
[114:21.84]Should I do part two or should we move on to the next game?
[114:25.30]What do you think?
[114:31.70]Play Metro?
[114:37.64]Next, next.
[114:40.85]Alright, maybe I'll come back to it.
[114:42.37]We'll see what else we got.
[114:46.11]We'll do part two maybe after.
[114:47.97]Let's just open part two and see what the fuck it is and give it like five minutes.
[114:52.97]And then that's it.
[115:01.35]I fucking love that.
[115:02.17]How it just disappears.
[115:03.11]Get this in here.
[115:07.21]Alright, going back in.
[115:09.13]Cheers.
[115:17.91]What a flip-flop streamer, I know.
[115:19.51]I really am.
[115:20.47]You got me on that, you do.
[115:23.96]More Star Trek?
[115:26.04]Well, we got a lot of things to play.
[115:28.76]So, let's just go into part two for like a couple minutes.
[115:32.58]See what the big fucking deal is.
[115:34.14]You know what I mean?
[115:35.92]See what the big fucking deal is.
[115:38.43]And then, did I lose... Um... I don't... Okay, did I?
[115:43.37]Is it still available?
[115:45.13]Okay.

[115:52.16]Uh, we are, we're good.
[115:52.98]Okay.
[115:53.10]Let's get the headphones back in.
[115:55.36]We'll jump into part two.
[115:56.82]I'm not going to beat part two.
[115:57.78]We're just going to check it out and see what it's in it.
[116:00.20]That's it.
[116:01.80]No more.
[116:03.35]No less.
[116:06.17]I can guarantee you that.
[116:08.85]There's one thing I'm certain of.
[116:09.63]We're going to move on.

[142:43.07]Many thanks.
[142:44.26]Have a profitable day.
[142:56.60]It was important for stores like this to maintain a constant stream of customers, so the cashiers wouldn't have time to contemplate their rapidly approaching obsolescence.

[144:10.39]Okay.
[144:13.83]Okay.
[144:32.35]Open the freezer, please!
[144:35.01]Just... I can't...
[145:14.24]Is this what you wanted, sir?
[145:15.35]There you are.
[145:19.37]What does he want?
[145:20.03]What the fuck do you want?
[145:21.05]What do you want?
[145:22.67]What does he want?
[145:27.59]Oh.
[145:42.06]He wanted one of these.
[145:59.39]Probably better if I put it in the right way, right?
[146:06.86]Huh?
[146:07.58]What does that mean?
[146:17.67]What do you want?
[146:28.07]Get it the right fucking way.
[146:31.17]I don't have any jumbos.
[146:33.09]Ah, you fucking wanker.
[146:42.95]Oh, I love the taste of sugar.
[146:44.75]Yeah.
[146:48.04]Hey, by the way, pretty shitty Neil Goldman impression you're doing, by the way.
[146:51.96]Not good.
[146:54.06]I could do better than that.
[147:06.93]I'm never gonna fucking get this.
[147:08.99]What is this doing here?
[147:10.07]You didn't buy this.
[147:29.25]How did this get here?
[147:34.51]Oh, you're very good at scanning.
[147:36.33]Now, would you pass that to me?
[147:48.76]Bye.
[147:59.44]Get your hand...
[148:24.70]And here are some banknotes for you.
[148:26.26]Yeah, get out of here.
[148:26.88]Keep the change, good human.
[148:28.56]Why is this fun?
[148:29.58]Why is this fun?
[148:30.26]Why am I playing this still?
[148:32.26]Who told me to play this?
[148:35.48]Why am I still doing this?
[148:41.23]I don't know why I'm still playing this game.
[148:43.87]Oh, this person's angry.
[148:45.79]I'll take a paper copy of yesterday's news.
[148:50.58]Got it.
[148:51.02]Instantly win.
[148:52.93]And I'll take my daily lottery ticket as well.
[149:04.74]Oh dear, I'm feeling a little faint today, dearie.
[149:09.36]Do you think you could scratch that lottery ticket for me?
[149:13.08]Bitch.
[149:13.44]You can use my quarter.
[149:20.55]Oh no, it's a Minecraft creeper.
[149:21.93]You lost, honey.
[149:29.82]Oh, I guess I won't be getting those upgrades today.
[149:34.58]Off with you.
[149:42.91]Let me just write you a check for those.
[149:46.49]There we are.
[149:47.81]I'm being silent because it's hard.
[149:57.40]Oh, what a kind young human you are.
[150:01.34]Have a lovely day.
[150:02.99]I'm taking a fucking bun with you.
[150:13.93]So I'm like, yeah, brah, it's a buyer's market.
[150:16.46]They're looking at me like I'm crazy, you know?
[150:19.22]And what are you talking?
[150:20.64]No, no, I'm talking to you.

[151:26.58]No, not you, the other, uh, forget it.

[154:21.31]I actually put... Why don't you bring up that display and we can... Yeah, bro.
[154:26.04]I'm fucking totally into this shit.
[154:28.56]You know what I'm saying?

[156:11.08]I'm done.
[156:11.60]That was really funny.
[156:12.38]That was a funny game.
[156:14.48]That was a funny game.
[156:16.16]Let's do one more.
[156:16.78]Which funny game?
[156:17.44]Auto Mechanic?
[156:17.98]Is that a funny game?
[156:37.56]A true grease monkey.
[156:38.64]Get your hands dirty in our simulated mechanics shop.
[156:52.80]OK.
[156:58.50]Is it funny yet?
[156:59.31]Is it a funny stream?
[157:02.07]Hello, human.
[157:03.09]This is an accurate simulation of auto mechanic.
[157:07.25]Take a look at this board for instructions.
[157:13.04]Is this Rick and Morty?
[157:13.84]This is Justin Roiland.
[157:14.58]I already know him.
[157:16.36]That's Justin fucking Roiland.
[157:42.61]by the far superior robot people.
[157:45.87]But, you know, I mean, I don't want to make it, I'm not trying to make it about me, I'm just a news anchor.
[157:52.81]Now let's go to Sally, who's on the scene.
[157:56.30]You're listening to All News All the Time on radio.
[158:00.58]Oh, that was fun.
[158:02.14]That was fun.
[158:05.38]That was a fun game.
[158:07.86]Let's go ahead and move on.
[158:11.40]We're going to do Farpoint.
[158:14.19]Barpoint.
[158:20.75]Pretty fun game.
[158:21.59]Pretty funny game.
[158:22.11]It was a funny game for a funny YouTuber.
[158:24.85]A funny streamer.
[158:26.39]Okay, let me like see.
[158:35.50]Play Metro?
[158:36.26]What the fuck are you guys talking about?
[158:43.96]What?
[158:44.72]Metro, like, last light?
[158:48.22]What are you guys talking about?
[158:49.04]Like, Metro's not... We're doing VR tonight.
[158:57.50]Okay, hold on a minute.
[159:00.32]Let me get this straight here.
[159:01.56]Are you left or right-handed?
[159:02.88]I am right-handed.
[159:03.68]I'm right-handed.
[159:10.33]I don't think this is using the move controllers.
[159:13.98]I'm right-handed.
[159:15.88]I think I need the controller.
[159:18.44]I do.
[159:22.37]Alright, left or right-handed?
[159:26.45]Select if you are left.
[159:28.31]Okay, how tall are you?
[159:30.45]To match how tall you are.
[159:39.32]Don't even, don't say a shit, okay?
[159:44.66]Fucking assholes How tall you are
[160:14.59]Adjust the height to match how tall you are.
[160:26.32]Of course, this game would do that shit.
[160:29.78]Oh, what a funny joke.
[160:32.10]What a funny joke.
[160:32.72]Jerma's not fucking tall.
[160:34.12]Oh, that's fucking... We haven't heard that one before.
[160:37.05]What do you want me to do?
[160:40.15]This shape represents the tracking area of the camera.
[160:44.53]The PlayStation camera tracks the VR headset and DualShock 4 wireless controller.
[160:50.27]To play Farpoint, you must be within the tracking area.
[160:53.52]Okay.
[160:54.80]If the controller or the VR headset go outside of the tracking area, they cannot be tracked.
[161:01.36]If you get near the edge or the tracking is lost, this shape will appear in game to guide you back into position.
[161:07.79]Engage.
[161:11.90]Okay.
[161:12.06]Sigh.
[161:41.67]Connecting to live stream.
[161:43.21]They're punching into my stream.
[161:44.91]Cool.
[161:49.79]Hello, planet Earth.
[161:51.90]I'm Eva Tyson, one of the 230 scientists and engineers stationed up here on the Pilgrim.
[161:58.64]Regular viewers of my feed will notice I am not in my traditional t-shirt and socks.
[162:04.60]I'm in a spacesuit.
[162:06.60]And that is because today I am going home.
[162:10.54]And joining me on that homeward flight is one of my colleagues, Dr. Grant Moon.
[162:15.41]Far point.
[162:16.73]Hi.
[162:17.97]It's actually pretty incredible because we've both been aboard the Pilgrim for three months.
[162:22.21]But because there are so many people up here studying the anomaly, this is actually the first time that Dr. Tyson and I have met.
[162:28.64]I don't know what this game is, but whatever.
[162:30.12]Hello, Dr. Tyson.
[162:32.26]Get your fucking hands off me.
[162:35.86]I'm sure it goes without saying, I'm a specialist in a branch that applies the laws of physics and chemistry to analyze the genesis and demise of various nebulae in the universe.
[162:45.22]Right.
[162:45.42]Observable objects, atomic particles, all the way up.
[162:49.12]Pretty much anything on the candela and thermodynamic temperature scales.
[162:53.07]It includes aspects of astronomy and cosmology as well, but it's actually more complex than that.
[162:57.87]He's a star expert.
[163:00.55]Okay.
[163:02.13]You know, using that would save a lot of space on my resume.
[163:04.61]It really would.
[163:06.95]Good acting!
[163:07.59]Good acting!
[163:08.31]This got closer, by the way.
[163:32.93]If we look out the window, you should be able to see the shuttle that's coming to pick us up.
[163:39.27]The Wanderer.
[163:40.79]Named after the poem.
[163:41.73]The Wanderer returns.
[163:44.57]And if we link to the pilot's POV camera, you'll get a good view of the entire station, as well as the radiation anomaly behind us.
[163:53.62]And if you're lucky, we should just be able to see the Big Dipper off to the side, too.
[164:00.02]Here we go.
[164:04.89]Okay, well, now here we are.
[164:06.15]Oh, this actually is pretty elaborate.
[164:15.89]Oh, my.
[164:16.60]This is more elaborate than the Star Trek.
[164:18.40]What am I doing?
[164:19.80]Wanderer, this is Pilgrim.
[164:21.14]We're ready for you in the airlock.
[164:22.66]Please activate your auto-docking sequence.
[164:24.72]Do I need the move controllers?
[164:27.68]Roger that, Pilgrim.
[164:28.70]This is Wanderer.
[164:29.68]Auto-docking sequence engaged.
[164:31.09]Thank you, Wanderer.
[164:33.67]You're looking good.
[164:39.07]Whoa!
[164:42.03]Uh, Wanderer, we're having some difficulties syncing with your docking gear.
[164:45.29]That's a pretty good ping.
[164:46.97]That's a pretty good ping.
[164:50.97]Roger that, Pilgrim.
[164:51.85]Waiting on you.
[164:55.25]That's it.
[164:56.19]Keep it coming.
[165:00.59]Whoa.
[165:02.07]I probably shouldn't be standing for this.
[165:03.49]We're going to try a manual reboot.
[165:05.58]Stand by.
[165:12.76]Don't crash.
[165:14.16]Fucking yawn.
[165:14.63]That's so rude.
[165:17.05]I'm sorry.
[165:17.43]Let's go.
[165:17.89]Dr. Tyson, I'd rather do this by the book.
[165:39.29]It's not.
[165:39.69]Alright, can we, can we go?
[165:41.83]Can we go?
[166:10.21]I mean, if this was dead space, it'd be cool.
[166:16.59]But it's not.
[166:17.37]It ain't dead space.
[166:19.63]It's not dead space.
[166:21.95]I mean, that's kind of cool.
[166:26.88]Roger.
[166:27.28]Holding position.
[166:29.34]Okay.
[166:32.86]Okay.
[166:34.28]I'm opening the outer hatch.
[166:36.74]Tethers are attached.
[166:42.74]Looking good.
[166:44.86]So, your name?
[166:46.04]It's, uh, seriously Dr. Moon?
[166:49.90]Yeah, but for all the playground teasing, look where I am right now.
[166:55.93]Alright, this might have been, like, not a game.
[166:58.37]60 yards out.
[167:01.33]Maybe it is.
[167:03.43]Wait, wait, wait.
[167:08.36]Here's the inevitable like something wrong happens the very beginning of the game It's gonna suck us in Oh shit, it's one of those things you put your hands on that like books the electricity hit your hands in the globe What am I doing
[167:37.80]My guy's had his hand on his dick the whole time.
[167:42.10]How do I get my hand off my dick?
[167:43.72]Cut it now.
[167:46.48]What do you want me to do?
[167:49.74]Cut it.
[167:50.16]Cut what?
[167:51.48]Cut it.
[167:52.24]Cut it.
[167:56.12]What are we cutting?
[167:58.02]What do you want me to do?
[167:58.86]Don't leave us.
[168:22.46]Okay.
[168:24.24]Guy's got his hand on his dick the whole time.
[168:27.30]Didn't even care.
[168:28.58]Apparently.
[168:29.26]For some reason.
[168:39.01]Very pretty.
[168:46.57]Whoa.
[168:51.18]Brace for impact.
[168:53.18]What?
[168:53.48]Brace for impact.
[168:55.78]Brace for impact.
[169:03.49]Okay.
[169:04.85]Uh, so we crash land.
[169:07.13]We're currently in a spacesuit.
[169:10.63]Obvious things I am obviously telling you for some reason.
[169:17.24]Cass, location report now.
[169:22.30]Location unknown.

[172:45.34]Wow.
[172:47.76]What?
[172:49.16]Wow.
[172:50.14]You actually have to... Can you guys see that?

[173:10.98]Okay.
[173:15.61]Pretty cool.
[173:22.66]Wow.
[173:23.24]Dr. Moon, Dr. Tyson, this is Wanderer.
[173:25.76]Do you copy?
[173:27.66]Give me some action, man.
[173:28.56]Come on.
[173:29.42]This is too cool.
[173:30.70]You have too many cool game mechanics to not give me action right fucking now.
[173:34.70]Come on.

[188:45.68]Yeah.
[190:23.55]Alright.

[197:12.82]Open your parachute at 4,000 feet and...
[197:16.68]Where did that go?
[197:17.80]Did I get it?
[197:19.06]Did I fucking... It's like a lawn mower.
[197:27.44]Did I do it?
[197:27.98]I have no idea if I did it right.
[197:30.44]What the fuck?

[198:01.72]Where do I go?
[198:02.24]What does that mean?
[198:07.08]You're too far off course.
[198:08.68]This jump is over.
[198:18.50]What?
[198:20.76]I don't understand what just happened.
[198:21.87]I really don't.
[198:27.51]What the fuck was that?
[198:28.45]It's fucking Batman!
[198:45.47]I'd be confused too if I skipped all the tutorials.
[198:51.24]This is the tutorial.
[198:58.40]No, that's it.
[198:59.40]I'm going to move on.
[199:07.13]Just end the stream.
[199:09.49]I will.
[199:10.01]I will very, very shortly.
[199:19.79]Didn't you already do?
[199:20.67]Yeah, I did do.
[199:21.49]Actually, you know what?
[199:22.01]I did.
[199:24.35]You know, you're right.
[199:28.13]I'm getting to that point where I've, like, I've been... Ah, no, no, no.
[199:31.25]We're gonna start over.
[199:33.12]Um... Like, I've been drinking and I've had a VR helmet on my head for three and a half hours.
[199:40.32]So I'm, like, kind of delirious right now.
[199:44.50]Alright, we'll try one more time.
[199:46.18]One more time.
[199:46.64]No, don't fucking enter rest mode.
[199:48.59]What the hell are you doing?
[199:51.57]One more jump.
[199:54.37]And then I'm ending the stream.
[199:59.13]What am I even doing?
[200:00.74]Uh, trying to figure out how to end the stream.
[200:02.40]Because I've been drinking.
[200:08.16]And had a VR helmet plastered on my fucking head for three hours.
[200:12.26]I'm not sure what I'm doing, actually.
[200:13.74]To be honest with you.
[200:15.48]I will be completely honest.
[200:20.54]We'll try that again.
[200:21.92]I rage quit way too early.
[200:23.00]That was fucking stupid.
[200:31.02]Yes, that's fine.
[200:31.94]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[200:32.30]Alright, I'm not going to skip the tutorial now.
