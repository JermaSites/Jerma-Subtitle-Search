[00:08.41]If that scumbag thinks he can take us on, if he thinks he's going to destroy our will and take down our pride, he has no idea what he's dealing with.
[00:17.05]Sergeant Truffletop, you are my leader of the command unit.
[00:20.55]You must take it forward and you must find him and destroy him.
[00:25.04]Puffle Duffle, say hello to the missus for me.

[03:07.12]I got scared.
[03:07.68]I thought you were trying to kill me.
[03:09.58]I went back, I sat down at the computer again.
[03:12.06]But I thought you were using like telekinetic powers to try to kill me.
[03:16.59]Your executive is dead.
[03:20.89]What?
[03:21.33]This person's not alive.
[03:24.13]They're just not alive.
[03:26.10]I'm tapped into the link.
[03:27.62]No, you're dead.
[03:28.52]Your guy's not even breathing.
[03:29.60]You're just sitting there as a corpse.
[03:32.10]Easy, easy, easy, easy.
[03:33.44]Whoa, why are you in here?
[03:38.58]Your guy's face is so fucked up.
[03:41.37]One of his eyes is open and one of them is closed.
[03:44.85]You are deep in thought right now.
[03:46.69]That thing has taken over.
[03:47.71]You've done that too many times.
[03:48.91]You know what I mean?
[03:51.07]Like, you've done this so many times, you, like, shouldn't be doing this anymore.
[03:55.67]Where the hell'd you go?
[04:04.31]Oh, dude, that was rough.

[04:14.49]No!
[04:19.53]What is going on?
[04:22.30]Why is there like an organ playing?
[04:25.92]Don't look over here.
[04:29.38]Whatever you do, for like the next minute, do not look over here.
[04:34.83]Did you just make a unit that is playing an organ of death?
[04:40.28]Nah.
[04:43.46]You can turn around in 10 seconds and like notice that there's a monster behind you.
[04:47.90]Really?
[04:48.20]Yeah.
[04:48.94]So you're telling me in 10 seconds I can turn around?
[04:54.33]I would turn now.
[04:55.51]Turn now.
[05:01.45]You can't stop me.
[05:03.53]He thinks he's so big, he thinks he's so goddamn strong.
[05:05.97]Do you think he's strong enough to take on the march of the C-3PO's?
[05:09.70]I doubt it.
[05:12.00]Oh shit.
[05:25.09]This is a Jack in the Box.
[05:27.89]Yeah, we built some hinges on our warehouse.
[05:32.57]Hey.
[05:32.71]What are you doing over there?
[05:34.90]Nothing much.
[05:36.30]I'm just coming over here to kill you.
[05:37.78]Yeah, that's fine.
[05:38.28]Just get over right here and stand, like, right there.
[05:40.76]Right over there?
[05:41.72]Yeah, stand over right there.
[05:42.94]Okay, I'm coming.
[05:51.99]What a waste of 500 billion dollars.
[05:55.19]My grandfather told me.
[05:57.13]This is the button you press when you know you've been defeated.
[06:01.75]It's the final stand.
[06:04.01]Activate it.
[06:05.89]Let him come.
[06:11.48]They killed themselves.
[06:16.16]What is this guy?
[06:22.20]I did it.
[06:22.66]I won.
[06:26.77]Well, how did you get out there?
[06:28.53]Help.
[06:29.99]I don't understand how you did this.
[06:31.47]Let me in.
[06:32.99]I'm going to let you in.
[06:33.91]Just be careful.
[06:36.07]How did you get stuck out there?

[06:43.51]Yeah.
[06:45.15]What did you want to discuss?
[06:46.39]We're a military compound not too far away.
[06:49.66]You've been... Yeah.
[06:51.56]You know what?
[06:56.99]What did I do again?
[06:57.77]You know what?
[07:02.24]It doesn't matter.
[07:03.46]We were playing for two hours.
[07:04.76]Two fucking hours of this!
