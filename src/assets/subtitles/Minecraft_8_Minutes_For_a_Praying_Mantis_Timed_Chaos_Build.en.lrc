[00:08.62]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.32]I am the Cactus.
[00:13.80]Welcome to another Timed Chaos build.
[00:16.94]And I'm like stuck down here like this.
[00:19.68]Hey, do not close me in.
[00:22.41]This is... Now I'm stuck.
[00:25.61]Okay, this is a Timed Chaos build, like I said, with MLC_St3alth and Etalyx.
[00:30.91]Hello, gentlemen.
[00:32.77]Hi.
[00:33.63]How's it going, Jerma viewers?
[00:35.50]Hi.
[00:35.64]Hi.
[00:36.67]So this week's episode, we are going to build a praying mantis.
[00:41.06]And this could be the toughest one yet, considering it's a praying mantis and it's incredibly difficult.
[00:46.92]So we're gonna have eight minutes, just like last time, to build this thing.
[00:51.30]And... Are you guys ready?
[00:52.86]Wait, where are we doing this?
[00:53.96]Like, right here?
[00:56.47]In the shadow of the giant back here, I guess.
[00:59.07]I don't know.
[01:00.49]Let me change it back to daytime.
[01:01.89]The cheese guy?
[01:02.57]In the morning.
[01:04.89]The guy that's like a block of American cheese.
[01:09.51]Alright.
[01:10.35]We got plenty of area to work with here.
[01:12.11]Hey, we need that space.
[01:15.53]He's building a grass trophy.
[01:16.95]Alright, he's building something that's really, like, not allowed.
[01:22.02]Are you ready?
[01:22.40]I don't know what this is.
[01:24.60]I'm gonna start the timer, and then we're gonna be in a lot of trouble, so are you ready?
[01:27.06]Nope, because I gotta delete this thing.
[01:29.46]Alright, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete.
[01:33.67]Alright, and in three... Wait, what are we building again?
[01:38.19]Hold on.
[01:39.33]A praying mantis.
[01:40.17]We went over this.
[01:41.27]I forgot.
[01:41.83]Alright, praying mantis in three, two, one, go.
[01:46.02]Alright.
[01:48.12]Where's the front?
[01:48.78]Where's the back?
[01:49.46]I don't know.
[01:49.92]I don't know what a praying mantis looks like.
[01:52.12]Alright, start with the legs.
[01:53.26]There's like four spindly little legs.
[01:55.42]Alright, so he's got four... No, he only has two legs, doesn't he?
[01:58.98]You guys just get started.
[02:00.02]I'm googling Praying Mantis.
[02:01.14]I think he's got four.
[02:02.74]No, I think Praying Mantis has... I don't know.
[02:05.85]No, he has two.
[02:06.91]He crawls on his hands and knees, doesn't he?
[02:10.39]Why didn't we look up what a Praying Mantis looks like?
[02:13.59]I'm pretty sure he's only got... I think he's got four legs.
[02:15.61]I don't have the four green wool.
[02:17.59]He has four legs.
[02:18.43]That's Google Images here.
[02:20.25]He has four legs?
[02:21.33]Where are they?
[02:22.61]Oh my god, what are you doing?
[02:24.46]I'm building a big spiny leg.
[02:26.80]We didn't agree on the same color.
[02:29.67]Well, we're using dark green, or whatever the darker one is.
[02:32.37]Alright, like, why can't I put a block down here?
[02:35.65]See, here's his legs.
[02:36.69]So that's, okay.
[02:38.21]He's gonna be like a grasshopper.
[02:39.71]He's gonna come out this way.
[02:44.92]Okay, or delete all of my blocks if you want to.
[02:47.86]Wait, how do you place a block?
[02:49.16]Oh, right click.
[02:49.78]How do you place a block?
[02:51.64]How do you place a block?
[02:54.28]I was like, why is it destroying everything?
[02:56.06]So wait, are his four legs bad?
[02:58.22]I gotta look up what he looks like.
[03:01.68]No, he's got a really long body.
[03:04.42]Yeah, he's got like two in the front and then two on the side, like right next to him.
[03:09.03]And then a really long body in the back with wings on top.
[03:12.70]This looks like a goose.
[03:18.43]Okay, so let's... Like a little spear body.
[03:20.65]You know what I'm saying?
[03:22.49]See, like three blocks wide?
[03:25.01]Four blocks.
[03:25.99]Alright, so... Don't make it any wider than this.
[03:29.09]And just make his body come out to touch the blocks.
[03:31.25]You know what I'm saying?
[03:32.03]Alright, good thing we're making like a goose grasshopper.
[03:34.01]This is perfect.
[03:35.02]Currently we're making... I don't know what this is.
[03:38.80]It looks like some kind of...
[03:41.20]Jungle Gem is what it looks like.
[03:42.63]I don't know.
[03:44.31]Let's make the slide.
[03:45.85]Oh, look, we're making another horse.
[03:47.23]Like, it's the same thing as the horse.
[03:49.09]It's the green horse.
[03:51.91]Hey, his body's going to be so much longer than this.
[03:54.02]Like, way longer.
[03:55.06]Like, hold on.
[03:55.91]Yeah, it's gotta go out past the legs.
[03:57.81]It's gotta go out past the legs.
[04:00.05]Alright, I'll start building his neck, I guess.
[04:03.53]Wait, I thought that's what I was doing just now.
[04:05.43]Oh, jeez.
[04:06.25]Is that the front, or is this the front?
[04:09.63]He's not like a giraffe.
[04:10.82]He has to come out long like this.
[04:14.06]Yeah, yeah, the net goes out pretty far.
[04:17.04]He's got his like scissor hands wait.
[04:18.72]Yeah, he should be looking up right now No, yeah, go start going up.
[04:23.10]Yeah, why is he going so far like left like what is the drama?
[04:26.86]What is this dude?
[04:27.96]He's like look at his stuff Like he go he looks up cuz he kind of like looks I will then start going up right now from here building
[04:38.75]Because his legs start where he starts going up.
[04:44.21]Hold on.
[04:44.91]We gotta redo the legs then.
[04:46.73]Alright, I'm working on the tail or something back here.
[04:51.31]Alright, three minutes have gone by.
[04:52.93]Oh, good.
[04:57.52]Three minutes already.
[04:59.04]Seriously, I just made a giant man's arm.
[04:59.92]This is not even...
[05:07.10]This might actually come together pretty well.
[05:09.65]I don't know.
[05:10.13]I don't know.
[05:10.51]I'm not convinced yet.
[05:11.35]I'm not convinced.
[05:12.07]Wait, what's going on with this leg?
[05:13.57]This is his leg.
[05:15.71]Why is this here then?
[05:18.11]Why is what where?
[05:19.78]Oh, wait.
[05:20.50]Are these the T-Rex arms?
[05:23.23]One of the things I'm making out, he has four legs.
[05:26.99]What have we made here?
[05:28.27]I'll make his face.
[05:30.67]This will be his face then.
[05:32.65]What happened?
[05:33.75]What have you done to Gumby?
[05:36.21]Looks like somebody put Gumby on the torture rack and stretched him out.
[05:41.19]What have you done to Gumby?
[05:43.63]This looks like some sort of dinosaur.
[05:48.49]Good thing we brought Gumby to the medieval times and put him on the stretcher.
[05:53.14]The breastplate stretcher.
[05:54.92]Alright, I'm making some wings.
[05:55.94]Alright, time to make his arms.
[05:59.32]Alright, I'm gonna work on his head.
[06:04.67]Four minutes and twenty seconds have gone by.
[06:06.99]If I cover up his body with the wings... Wait, this thing has wings?
[06:13.75]Yeah, dude.
[06:14.99]Praying mantises have wings.
[06:23.48]We're making like a centaur.
[06:26.68]This is not a praying mantis.
[06:28.05]This is a centaur.
[06:31.81]I did the arms like so wrong.
[06:38.05]He's got the same arms as the dude behind him.
[06:41.27]Come over here where I am.
[06:45.06]It looks like Alien.
[06:46.42]It looks like Alien from the movie Alien except he's green.
[06:50.30]I guess Preyman just kind of looks like an alien, doesn't he?
[06:54.10]No, like THE alien.
[06:58.06]With the big head.
[07:00.82]God, this is so awful.
[07:01.92]Five minutes have gone by.
[07:02.88]Whoops.
[07:05.30]Alright, I got, I got... I'm getting pretty good on the wings right here.
[07:11.47]We're doing pretty good.
[07:12.51]Alright, there's his head.
[07:13.29]Oh my god.
[07:16.83]Yeah, hi, I pranked Mantis.
[07:18.33]Are you guys making Squidward over there?
[07:21.83]Yes.
[07:23.80]he looks like oh my god this is the worst praying mantis we don't have no time you have to look at it where it like blocks out the rest of his body and it just looks hilarious like come back here come over here where I am
[07:40.24]Like, where it blocks out the back of his body.
[07:43.26]You can't even tell.
[07:44.02]It looks like a stick figure.
[07:45.10]Like a green alien.
[07:47.34]Oh, he really does just look like an alien.
[07:48.82]He looks like the South Park alien.
[07:52.16]Alright, okay, his body needs to be, like, not a complete atrocity.
[07:58.17]This needs to be, like, a little bit bigger.
[08:00.15]Or wider.
[08:00.65]A little more thick.
[08:04.18]Alright, six minutes have gone by.
[08:06.80]Six minutes?
[08:07.80]Good grief, man.
[08:10.54]I made some wings, so that's cool.
[08:14.33]I think... Oh, we've got a... Oh, no!
[08:22.07]The tiniest little legs.
[08:25.00]He's got to have... These hands have to be like knives.
[08:28.82]Yeah, make them... Okay, make them knives.
[08:30.94]My Minecraft is so bad at...
[08:34.18]Alright, now he has like machine guns apparently.
[08:37.30]What's the different colors?
[08:39.57]You said he had to have knives, so I made like... A sharp knife.
[08:43.93]Yeah.
[08:44.37]Alright, let's give this other one a knife too.
[08:46.95]Oh yeah.
[08:47.91]Don't mess with him, he's got like two Tommy guns.
[08:50.79]What are you... Oh, okay, good idea, good, good, good, good, good.
[08:54.13]Alright.
[08:54.91]Dude, these legs are too small.
[08:56.51]Like one hand, something happened when he was born.
[09:02.99]We have less than one minute.
[09:05.71]Look at his freaking head.
[09:06.87]It really just looks like an alien.
[09:09.49]Somebody... Alright, wait 30 seconds.
[09:14.83]30 seconds.
[09:16.45]He can fly more with these wings.
[09:17.63]Hold on, let's make him a bit bigger.
[09:21.94]Okay, here we go.
[09:22.76]His legs are a little bit more thick now.
[09:25.87]He's so wise.
[09:28.23]You guys kind of, okay.
[09:30.55]He's a little lopsided.
[09:32.60]15 seconds.
[09:33.76]And one hand is, like, extremely larger and thicker than the other.
[09:38.10]10 seconds.
[09:39.20]It looks like we combined two different things in the middle.
[09:41.62]Like, it doesn't even look like they're connected.
[09:43.65]Three seconds, two, one, and that's it.
[09:48.48]I put a torch on his face to make it look like he was smoking something.
[09:51.85]I don't know why.
[09:54.27]A good thing we combined two things in the middle.
[09:56.61]We made an airplane and then we combined it with this thing right here and then an alien.
[10:02.09]Somebody totally deleted my wings.
[10:04.62]I added more wings.
[10:07.72]Can somebody come explain to me what's going on over here?
[10:11.31]What is going on?
[10:12.09]Why does he have one hand that's... This is most certainly not a praying mantis.
[10:16.82]I think... One hand has a darker colored knife.
[10:21.64]It has seen more battle than the other.
[10:23.56]This is like... Oh my god.
[10:28.53]Come look at it from far away.
[10:29.71]It is so bad from far away.
[10:31.45]Like, up close, it's not that bad.
[10:34.71]This is not a praying mantis.
[10:36.92]It's like a dragon who just didn't make it.
[10:39.08]Like, just, like, I don't know.
[10:40.44]Dude, his wings are, like, on his butt.
[10:45.50]Oh, man.
[10:47.04]Yeah, we didn't, like, dozo enough.
[10:48.24]Like, this is, like, too long or we didn't, like, fill it in enough, like, right here.
[10:52.28]Because it's just, like, a lot of nothing.
[10:55.34]Oh, my God.
[10:55.92]Alright.
[10:56.24]Well, thanks for watching, guys.
[10:59.35]And we'll catch you guys all next time.
[11:01.49]And, of course, rate the thing and give it a name if you want to give it a name.
[11:06.27]And we'll see you all next time.
[11:07.23]Take care, everybody.
[11:10.03]Boo.
[11:12.07]Boo.
[11:12.23]Oh, downstairs.
[11:20.70]What?
[11:21.72]What just happened there?
[11:25.36]Ha ha.
