[00:44.03]Hi!
[00:45.23]Hey!
[00:46.81]Welcome guys, how are you?
[00:48.47]Good to see you.
[00:51.23]What day is it today?
[00:54.27]It's Friday.
[00:55.89]Friday at 6.58.
[00:57.23]No, 59.
[00:57.77]The clock struck 59.
[00:58.69]Let's blow some stuff up.
[01:02.53]Yeah, we're gonna play Red Faction Guerrilla.
[01:06.85]Oh, Jason Dartson!
[01:10.07]Jason, thanks for the 10 bucks immediately.
[01:13.95]Thank you.
[01:14.19]Haven't even gotten going yet.
[01:16.27]You might not even know if that 10 bucks is worth it yet.
[01:19.62]I might, like, sneeze into the camera.
[01:22.40]And then you have, like, a sneeze problem.
[01:24.10]And you're like, I'm not getting that fucking money.
[01:27.56]I just sneezed into the camera.
[01:28.76]That's uncalled for.
[01:32.81]But, let's let people trickle in.
[01:36.21]And play Red Faction Guerrilla.
[01:39.52]One of the classics from the THQ collection.
[01:45.82]Oh boy, you get to watch Jerma recover from... Oh, I thought you said I was recovering from my wisdom teeth.
[01:49.69]Well, Pastor Whiskey, hopefully your procedure went well.
[01:55.59]I'll be right back.
[01:56.83]We'll get started very soon.
[01:58.07]Let me just stumble over my words, like, we'll get started very soon.
[03:03.29]Alright, might as well get started.
[03:08.88]Let's put on the Batman music.
[03:11.16]Let's put on Christopher Nolan's Batman Red Faction Driller.
[03:17.30]Now it just changed.
[03:18.02]Now it's not Batman music.
[03:19.12]Now it's... Now it's like Lord of the Rings music.
[03:23.85]Like we just climbed up over the hill and we can see all of Mordor.
[03:32.86]I gotta change this.
[03:34.34]Now we're back to Batman.
[03:39.06]I love every time he changes his setting, he like smashes an axe down.
[03:44.76]Uh, FOV 70.
[03:46.08]That's not like... That's not... 70 is not like 70 FOV like first person.
[03:51.83]I think it's third person FOV.
[03:54.89]But we're never really live at 7.
[03:56.85]So we're like, let's go like 702.
[03:58.49]No, 70. 70.
[04:02.83]I'm going to stay simple.
[04:06.31]I do have to do this.
[04:08.33]There goes the audio.
[04:10.77]That looks good.
[04:11.39]That looks good.
[04:12.05]Hey, everything looks good.
[04:14.44]Let's just take it off of windowed mode.
[04:17.04]Because every time you alt-tab in this game, it puts you into window.
[04:19.12]And we're good.
[04:20.92]Here we go.
[04:22.64]Red Faction Gorilla.
[04:23.50]70 FOV.
[04:26.83]Not really FOV.
[04:28.81]Look, you'll see.
[04:30.11]New game.
[04:30.77]Get the cutscene.
[04:32.66]We're doing normal.
[04:34.68]Okay, here we go.
[04:36.08]Loud cutscene.
[04:37.46]There's the fucking moon.
[04:39.06]Let's see what happens.
[04:45.88]It's just like Dead Space.
[04:52.32]And Half-Life 2.
[04:52.92]That's the moon, alright.
[05:04.95]I like these macaroni and cheese faces these guys have.
[05:10.45]These like bent little... Alright, no more shitty jokes, let's listen.
[05:19.35]Oh, they're brothers, okay.
[05:27.92]Oh, we're on Mars, right, because it's Red Faction.
[05:32.90]Wow, learn how to fucking drive, dude.
[05:37.76]Oh no, not the EDF.
[05:38.60]So the EDF are like a bunch of dickheads?
[05:45.58]I was in EDF when I played EDF.
[05:48.74]Oh damn, so we're like bad people.
[06:03.17]Didn't enough people die the last time?
[06:04.54]Are there bugs in this game?
[06:05.40]We're under martial law here.
[06:07.22]Prison camps.
[06:09.08]Torture.
[06:10.84]Death squads.
[06:13.26]People need something to live for.
[06:14.40]Wow, so the EDF, like, saved the world from bugs and fucking took over with, like, a conglomerate takeover, huh?
[06:20.27]That's kind of fucked up.
[06:23.21]Well, this is it.
[06:24.37]I got your gear over there.
[06:26.83]So here's how it works.
[06:27.91]It'll be a couple of weeks before you... Oh.
[06:31.49]Wait here.
[06:33.91]I love that Xbox 360 headset he has on.
[06:38.21]Just so you know he has a microphone.
[06:42.17]This game is fucked.
[06:48.69]I'm actually excited.
[06:54.36]I can't wait to play this.
[07:03.60]Loading.
[07:04.16]Parker.
[07:06.04]Ooh, it's fuckin' smooth!
[07:06.96]This is like a I'm-gonna-kill-you scene.
[07:08.11]120 FPS, man.
[07:09.13]You guys don't see it, but I do.
[07:33.09]Shit up in the sky somebody shit in the sky edf gunship.
[07:37.17]Oh didn't think they'd be out here today I'll keep an eye on it you get the salvage destroy the laboratory
[07:54.71]Ow!
[07:55.98]Ow, my fucking head!
[07:56.88]Ow!
[07:56.94]I just can't... Holy shit!
[08:01.98]I didn't think... Ah!
[08:05.85]Oh my god!
[08:06.81]Oh my god!
[08:11.47]Here's the site I was telling you about.
[08:13.87]It was a research outpost once, before the marauders killed the scientists.
[08:18.37]Marauders?
[08:18.91]That was fucking insane!
[08:20.47]You don't want to be caught out here after dark.
[08:22.91]But it's a good place to find salvage.
[08:25.63]I'm here to mine.
[08:26.55]I hunt for scrap.
[08:27.53]Okay, I had like a headache starting this dream, and see you later.
[08:30.42]What am I holding?
[08:32.18]A sledgehammer and charges?
[08:34.30]Good.
[08:35.00]Let's see what you can do.
[08:35.80]I don't even have a sledgehammer in my hand anymore.
[08:37.48]What did I do?
[08:37.96]Shit.
[08:38.96]Up in the sky.
[08:40.89]E.D.F.
[08:41.39]gunship.
[08:42.31]Didn't think they'd be out here today.
[08:43.51]I don't know what that is.
[08:45.33]I'll keep an eye on it.
[08:46.41]You get to salvage.
[08:48.20]What?
[08:49.42]Did it change what I was doing?
[08:50.62]Okay, I'll... Where's my sledgehammer?
[09:02.64]I love how hitting the guy with the sledgehammer murders him, but blowing him up with a fucking mine doesn't.
[09:08.43]Okay, well let's go.
[09:09.17]Destroy the laboratory and tower.
[09:12.95]See that salvage on the ground?
[09:14.33]Pick it up so we can trade it.
[09:15.57]Alright.
[09:18.05]I got a bunch of syringes.
[09:19.31]Salvage is found by causing destruction.
[09:20.97]Collect salvage and trade it for upgrades.
[09:23.39]I'm going to love this game.
[09:25.98]This is going to be game of the year for me right now.
[09:27.48]Hold on a second.
[09:28.14]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[09:29.80]Oh, I had like a migraine earlier and it like... Fucking god damn it.
[09:33.02]I knew it.
[09:34.48]I knew it was going to fucking happen.
[09:36.06]I didn't know it was going to happen immediately on starting the stream.
[09:42.02]I knew, like, maybe at some point there'd be something interesting or funny in this game.
[09:45.43]And bang!
[09:46.45]Ten seconds into the stream, I, like, give myself a fucking migraine.
[09:51.65]Alright.
[09:52.01]What, uh... I need to drop the sensitivity.
[09:56.95]Migraine simulator.
[09:58.83]Let's go down to low.
[10:06.70]That's better.
[10:07.64]Destroy the laboratory and tower.
[10:09.04]Alright, we got that.
[10:10.88]Oh man, this is... This is so cool.
[10:21.77]I love it.
[10:24.85]It feels so fun just to smash things.
[10:27.73]Especially your brother.
[10:32.96]How do I save the game?
[10:34.61]Please auto-save, like... I'm gonna, like, running smash my brother's head.
[10:39.07]I have to, right?
[10:39.79]Like, I have to.
[10:40.35]I can't help it.
[10:40.93]I have to do it.
[10:44.45]Ugh.
[10:50.11]Oh, what?
[10:52.24]Destroy... Oh.
[10:53.20]Do I, like, blow that up?
[10:56.96]That was fucking cool.
[10:59.90]That was cool.
[11:02.20]Now what?
[11:06.02]Wait a minute, what am I doing?
[11:07.02]I can just break walls in this game!
[11:12.64]Shit, that changes everything!
[11:14.70]Oh my god.
[11:15.16]Oh my god, this is the fucking best game ever.
[11:18.75]This might be the best game ever made.
[11:21.21]What if I turn this over that way and the walls are gonna stop me in this game?
[11:24.01]Are you kidding me?
[11:29.21]Holy shit, this is fucking, this is so cool.
[11:38.56]Hold Q to bring up the weapon selection.
[11:40.72]Tap Q to swap for the last.
[11:42.08]Okay.
[11:42.36]It's just like, I can just roll.
[11:51.78]So can you, is there like a... Can that hurt me, by the way?
[12:02.90]Let's just blow up the bridge.
[12:05.97]Oh!
[12:09.86]Oh, I could do this all day.
[12:12.70]Wait, can I not move?
[12:13.94]Can I not get back up there?
[12:18.62]This is so cool.
[12:20.52]Can I honestly take this thing down?
[12:24.22]Okay, you're talking like potential best game ever made if I can drop this right now.
[12:29.53]This is fucking best game ever.
[12:41.84]Hey, I'm okay.
[12:42.73]That's so cool.
[12:49.71]I literally just got crushed by a fucking tower.
[12:51.85]And I came out like it was a plague.
[12:53.56]Oh, okay.
[12:53.72]So destroy this whole building.
[12:54.76]Wait, can I...
[13:08.41]Like, fuck the charges, man.
[13:09.83]Let's just crush this place.
[13:14.23]It's like the stress relief simulator, man.
[13:16.57]Like, I can just destroy the whole building with my hammer.
[13:18.19]I gotta take all the support beams.
[13:27.14]Whatever it takes.
[13:28.00]I'm not a terrorist.
[13:32.64]You think I am?
[13:33.36]The EDF are wiping out towns.
[13:36.34]Not like we need help.
[13:38.85]How have I never played this game before?
[13:42.31]I just want to do honest work here.
[13:44.47]That's what we're fighting for.
[13:46.69]If we don't resist, they'll take everything.
[13:50.35]Enough.
[13:52.25]You'll see I'm right about this.
[13:56.05]How much health is the building at?
[13:57.21]I love how the buildings are the bosses in this game.
[14:04.80]Give it two hours and he hates the game.
[14:06.18]I don't know man.
[14:07.12]This is fucking cool, man.
[14:10.76]How many more charges?
[14:13.12]I have nine.
[14:13.60]I can only put two out at a time though.
[14:22.87]This is what I'm talking about.
[14:24.29]This must be what it's like to work in, like, the demolition field.
[14:27.12]You know what I mean?
[14:27.56]When a building has to come down, a guy just runs around and throws, like, grenades everywhere.
[14:31.26]This must be so much fun.
[14:35.04]Imagine this was your job.
[14:36.02]Just destroy buildings.
[14:41.73]How fun.
[14:42.27]Okay.
[15:04.27]I love it.
[15:05.83]Oh, I love it.
[15:13.26]I just like popped up like a fucking piece of dumb toast.
[15:19.26]Oh no, it's the Earth Defense Force.
[15:20.84]We are the bugs.
[15:23.62]Daniel Mason, you are under arrest.
[15:26.44]Surrender or we will open fire.
[15:28.88]Alex, run.
[15:29.93]Run!
[15:36.83]Did they just light my brother up with a machine gun?
[15:38.79]They didn't shoot me?
[15:41.94]That's all that happened to him?
[15:43.24]Is he alive?
[15:43.74]Oh, if we get a funny death scene, like, brother, I love you scene, this is gonna be funny.
[15:51.63]He just took, like, 485 bullets.
[15:52.77]No, he's... Okay, he's dead.
[16:05.43]I'm gonna take my... That's where the logo comes from.
[16:08.23]Okay.
[16:10.21]Now I know where the logo comes from.
[16:11.54]It actually is the Earth Defense Force.
[16:12.74]Is this, like, some kind of... Are they connected at all?
[16:15.16]The Liberators.
[16:15.64]Like, this is the fucking... This is the same timeline.
[16:18.24]It literally is the EDF.
[16:34.97]from Earth Defense Force.
[16:36.71]Drop the weapon.
[16:38.23]One of the guys on the dev team must have really fucking hated that game.
[16:41.31]Drop it, smartass.
[16:47.36]Your brother is Daniel Mason.
[16:50.02]Yeah, he was.
[16:52.32]He's dead.
[16:53.10]This trailer and its contents have been confiscated by the Earth Defense Force.
[16:56.64]That's where I live.
[16:59.44]Don't play dumb with me, Miner.
[17:01.49]You're Red Faction.
[17:02.90]Oh, he said it.
[17:03.32]Well... It just got revoked.
[17:05.53]It got like fucking movie one-liner and... Am I dead?
[17:08.61]Nope.
[17:08.75]There was a sniper in the trees.
[17:10.41]Who's the sniper?
[17:34.65]Oh, that's, that's, that's Bill Boomenson!
[17:37.97]From Red Faction!
[17:39.83]The main character of the first game!
[17:41.47]No, that's not, that's not, he's dead.
[17:43.97]He's dead.
[17:45.15]There he is!
[17:50.15]There's Gregory Scone!
[17:52.71]The main character from the first game!
[17:59.21]Whatever.
[18:06.54]Nice shooting, buddy.
[18:09.08]You did a good job.
[18:11.05]Ice caps, uh... Excuse me, this is like fucking the future.
[18:15.55]Ice caps aren't gonna be around.
[18:16.65]Nice iPad.
[18:17.81]Wow, it... Oh, God.
[18:36.44]I know this is a lot to take in, but you're going to have to trust us.
[18:40.17]God, no.
[18:40.79]Why?
[18:41.05]No, no, no.
[18:42.85]Because you don't really have any other option.
[18:44.77]No, no, no.
[18:45.25]The commander thought you should have his school manual.
[18:47.59]It'll help you survive out here.
[18:49.10]No, don't let... The gorilla handbook.
[18:51.80]Oh, the gorilla reading a book contains tutorial videos and other information.
[18:55.62]Oh, new, okay.
[18:57.73]Welcome to the Red Faction.
[18:59.36]We'll start off with the basics.
[19:00.96]There are six populated sectors on Mars.
[19:04.14]Why is Mars like France?
[19:05.56]Badlands, Oasis, the Free Fire Zone, and Eos.
[19:08.59]That's fucking France.
[19:09.69]All of which are controlled by the Earth Defense Force.
[19:13.07]Our goal is to liberate all six sectors driving the EDF off the planet.
[19:17.47]There's only one problem.
[19:19.28]The EDF is a professional military organization.
[19:23.00]They've got the money, the training, and the firepower to take us down.
[19:27.58]Direct assaults are suicide.
[19:30.21]We need to hit their weak points, attack them when they least expect it, destroy high-value targets, and then get the hell out of there.
[19:38.28]If you ever need to hide from the EDF, restock ammo, or choose a different set of weapons for your field work, safe houses are set up throughout the world.
[19:46.34]Any available safe house will be marked on your map.
[19:49.27]Good luck.
[19:50.17]Wait, hold on.
[19:50.67]There are cars in Red Faction Guerrilla.
[19:53.21]Because it just went up a full letter grade, if that's true.
[19:59.69]Yes.
[19:59.97]Yeah.
[20:00.56]Okay.
[20:01.30]Like, where the fuck has this game been all my entire life?
[20:04.20]You know what I mean?
[20:06.33]Demolitions master, actions like- Okay, I- Where the fuck has this game been?
[20:11.79]It's planes.
[20:15.88]I'm gonna play the fuck out of this game, guys.
[20:20.89]There are giant missile launching tanks.
[20:22.67]Okay, well.
[20:26.59]Let's take this in later.
[20:28.75]Demolitions.
[20:29.15]But if you're going to be the best the Red Faction has to offer, then you need to know the tools of the trade.
[20:32.91]We've placed terminals around the world that will teach you how to demolish buildings quickly and efficiently.
[20:36.83]Pass the test and earn a little salvage for your time.
[20:38.91]Welcome to the Red Faction.
[20:40.01]We don't have access to the same supply lines as the EDF.
[20:44.08]We can steal their guns, but that's not enough.
[20:47.10]Sam is an engineer working for the Red Faction.
[20:50.26]She's come up with ways to improvise weapons from mining equipment and industrial tools, but she needs raw materials.
[20:56.89]That's where salvage comes in.
[20:59.05]When you destroy things, you'll often see salvage on the ground afterward.
[21:03.34]Collect it and bring it to Sam.
[21:05.42]The more salvage you supply her with, the better the equipment she'll be able to provide.
[21:09.20]So what's all this crazy shit you can get?
[21:10.54]Abandoned buildings are good sources of salvage, as are any of those high-tech EDF structures.
[21:15.74]Bring them down and bring the salvage to Sam.
[21:18.45]Okay.
[21:19.63]So you can...
[21:24.53]Alright, well, like, let's just test our new prowess, huh?
[21:28.09]Each sector contains missions that must be completed for liberation.
[21:31.21]Completing a mission also awards you salvage.
[21:33.70]Okay, well, that's cool.
[21:43.30]Get liberated!
[21:44.01]Alright, that was fun.
[21:47.71]Now what?
[21:55.25]Alright, let's go.
[21:57.77]When you die, you will respawn at the nearest available safe house.
[21:59.91]Your death will also cause morale to drop.
[22:03.95]What?
[22:07.65]Population demoralized?
[22:10.71]Oh, man.
[22:11.33]Wait, I can't just, like, GTA?
[22:13.97]I can't treat this like GTA.
[22:16.61]So you're telling me that, like, I can't, like... I can't, like, take a swing at this lady.
[22:22.58]Oh, boy.
[22:23.40]That's... Okay.
[22:27.52]Let's see what's going on here.
[22:29.01]This is the upgrades table.
[22:30.01]Trade any salvage you've collected for weapon upgrades.
[22:33.03]Alright.
[22:34.55]Remote charge count.
[22:37.81]Place three.
[22:39.33]You can place three charges.
[22:41.99]More ammo.
[22:45.01]Arc welder.
[22:48.41]Oh, man.
[22:50.86]Salvage collector.
[22:51.62]Pick up salvage in a vehicle.
[22:53.02]Ugh.
[22:56.97]Just go fuck up the EDF.
[22:58.13]This is so cool.
[23:00.43]New handbook entry.
[23:01.47]Oh, but I... But the guy carrying the fucking Minecraft sandstone block.
[23:05.95]Like, I can't kill this guy?
[23:09.87]I can't kill realistic Minecraft?
[23:13.60]Look at it.
[23:14.08]Like, why can I not take a swing at realistic Minecraft?
[23:22.69]Alright, let's get a mission.
[23:30.15]Oh, perfect.
[23:30.69]Okay.
[23:31.44]I can just save it.
[23:33.62]Okay, I got it saved now.
[23:35.78]No, like, I'll be here all day if I keep doing this shit.
[23:39.78]Geographic rule.
[23:50.81]Alright, let's go.
[23:52.58]I want to unlock shit.
[23:54.22]What is this?
[23:54.68]Is it a gun?
[23:55.88]Let's go for a mission.
[23:59.02]Mm-hmm.
[24:08.78]I know you're familiar with demolitions, so maybe you can help us out.
[24:12.26]We need that building destroyed.
[24:14.58]Blow up anything that the EDF could trace back to us.
[24:17.64]You got it.
[24:18.06]Think you can handle it?
[24:19.34]Right, is he talking about this camp?
[24:24.78]Destroy the abandoned base.
[24:26.15]We're transmitting the base coordinates now.
[24:30.20]Your map displays objectives and other places of interest.
[24:32.20]Follow the nav beacon to get to the abandoned base.
[24:35.88]Okay.
[24:36.97]So it's just like a waypoint.
[24:37.89]So we're going to blow that up.
[24:40.99]Okay.
[24:41.49]Sounds good.
[24:43.09]Now, what is this?
[24:44.03]Oh, man.
[24:44.39]I got a giant cartoon car.
[24:46.60]Okay.
[24:55.10]Weapons locker.
[24:55.76]Scroll through available weapons with the up and down.
[24:57.66]Press 2, 3, or 4 to assign the selected weapon.
[25:00.91]Remote charges.
[25:01.65]Okay, I don't have anything, so... All I have is remote charges and assault rifle.
[25:08.53]I can't do this arc well, do you?
[25:09.85]Okay.
[25:10.25]Oh my god.
[25:10.92]I'm sorry.
[25:20.38]Car found refugees from other colonies and our numbers grew your brother joined us soon after Did I just kill that guy no he's mine was always Dan's problem couldn't run from a fight Can you kill can you destroy buildings with a car if I crash into a building will it like just come crumbling down I Hope so
[25:53.01]Oh, shit.
[25:55.01]Oh, I hit the fucking toy train.
[25:58.37]Oh, the car exploded.
[26:00.67]Can I get out of the car?
[26:06.51]Oh, God damn it.
[26:08.49]Alright, I, ah.
[26:11.05]Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[26:14.96]Let's go.
[26:16.32]Oh, I could spend this, I could do this for a million years.
[26:20.63]Got it.
[26:21.23]I'm on my way.
[26:23.27]Davies.
[26:24.07]Hugo Davies.
[26:25.09]That was an extreme car crash.
[26:27.19]How'd you get caught up in this?
[26:29.69]You're taking up so much of the screen tutorial.
[26:32.25]What the fuck?
[26:33.28]When we resisted, the EDF rolled in.
[26:36.58]I can't even move now.
[26:39.68]Come on.
[26:41.06]I found refugees from other colonies and our numbers grew.
[26:44.58]Your brother joined us soon after.
[26:46.02]Get like a GTA radio, dude.
[26:47.48]This is great.
[26:49.20]There was always Dan's problem.
[26:50.98]Couldn't run from a fight.
[26:52.01]So there it is.
[26:53.13]If I were more like him, we'd have a chance of winning this thing.
[26:57.51]Maybe.
[27:06.20]Oh, man.
[27:08.52]Alright, we can't... I can't use the... I gotta use the car to destroy the base, right?
[27:14.90]That's important, isn't it?
[27:15.76]Is it like a turbo boost?
[27:23.29]I'm not going fast enough.
[27:24.23]I need to go up the stairs.
[27:25.39]Shit!
[27:32.83]Goddammit.
[27:34.13]It's locked.
[27:35.17]Whatever, just destroy it with the charges.
[27:37.95]This is the tutorial.
[27:42.40]Wait, this is not even the right place.
[27:46.28]Oh, shit.
[27:46.74]What if there's something up there?
[27:47.72]And I destroyed the stairs to get up there.
[27:50.36]Goddammit.
[27:50.92]Well, where... I can't even get up there.
[27:58.65]We have to go around.
[28:09.62]You can you can destroy that you can destroy that okay good to know perfect.
[28:14.10]We got a great opportunity here.
[28:15.10]I'm gonna turn right Turn right again, and then up this Let's destroy this fucking building now.
[28:25.55]What do you say?
[28:31.85]I took out one tube.
[28:32.75]Oh God damn it.
[28:35.72]Oh well
[28:40.17]Where the fuck is this place?
[28:43.05]Wait.
[28:45.98]What am I... What are we looking at here?
[28:51.36]Where is this?
[28:52.18]And why is it, like... This is not abandoned.
[28:54.68]How do I call my... Wait.
[29:03.71]Hold on a minute.
[29:04.29]Wait a minute.
[29:04.63]Wait a minute.
[29:05.03]What... The GPS, like, led me there.
[29:07.75]And then it... Did I...
[29:10.70]Is it an alert level?
[29:11.62]Oh, God.
[29:18.75]Look at the map.
[29:19.37]I mean, like, how do you pull up the map?
[29:21.59]M doesn't do anything.
[29:25.23]The navigation, like, went to... That was the right place?
[29:27.99]Let's just get in the fucking giant goopy ice cream truck.
[29:32.01]It's, like, up there.
[29:32.55]Okay, it's tabbed.
[29:41.88]Okay.
[29:41.98]Get out of the way.
[29:44.32]I was in the right place.
[29:45.20]Okay.
[29:48.84]I can sprint faster than most vehicles.
[29:55.26]Destroy the abandoned base.
[29:56.67]There are a ton of people here.
[30:01.17]No, it's because I broke the fucking stairs.
[30:02.89]That's what happened.
[30:03.59]Alright, we're going to use this.
[30:04.55]We're going to jump on this.
[30:12.04]I think I might have to restart the mission, because I've ruined the staircase.
[30:19.34]Like, I have to go up there.
[30:21.10]Alright, we're gonna, like, we're gonna improvise.
[30:22.93]And from here to there.
[30:31.75]Nope.
[30:34.16]I needed to go up this ramp.
[30:37.90]I need to make, like, a rubble pile so I can do the mission.
[30:50.57]Let me up there.
[30:52.86]Alright, I'm at your base.
[30:55.10]Good.
[30:55.92]Use whatever you can to bring her down.
[30:58.75]OK.
[31:00.80]I actually had to use this fucking ramp.
[31:02.32]I can't believe I needed this fucking staircase.
[31:04.52]Oh my god.
[31:08.70]I'm reloading it.
[31:09.78]Like, we're just gonna reload it.
[31:11.08]Like, I needed to go up that ramp.
[31:12.76]Where the fuck is this?
[31:13.44]Right here.
[31:35.47]Start me all the way back I'm getting like too excited with the fucking just go go hurry up This will be a piece of cake we're transmitting the base coordinates now
[31:53.53]Like the game mechanics are making me too excited to play the actual game.
[31:56.91]It's fucking right here.
[31:58.05]Let's go up the goddamn stairs.
[32:00.89]There it is.
[32:01.75]Alright, go climb up the fucking staircase.
[32:02.92]I tried to go around.
[32:03.52]It was all covered by mountains.
[32:22.48]There we go.
[32:22.94]It's done.
[32:23.38]I could have literally gone around.
[32:25.34]Could I have?
[32:25.68]Yeah, I got an alert level.
[32:28.56]That's fine.
[32:44.32]You left some fuel tanks behind.
[32:46.12]You can shoot them or set chargers to blow them up.
[32:48.66]You can't.
[32:48.90]Mason, an EDF unit is heading your way.
[32:51.38]I'd hurry up and finish the job.
[32:55.12]You said this was going to be easy.
[32:56.89]More EDF are on the way.
[32:58.75]Get back to the safe house.
[33:00.51]Where are they?
[33:00.89]Mason, they're right on top of you.
[33:02.59]Take cover.
[33:03.67]What is he talking about?
[33:04.75]You said this was going to be easy.
[33:06.23]Alright, whatever, yeah.
[33:14.58]okay how do I how do I take things oh it's ammo crates okay well whatever oh we gotta get out of here no I just broke the cover I took the cover out thanks for the car
[33:43.29]I don't have enough fist bumps.
[33:49.25]They can just track me down so easily.
[33:56.52]Yeah, he stole a car and he went like 200 meters that way.
[34:01.40]Why didn't I do anything?
[34:03.32]What do you mean, why didn't I do anything?
[34:13.92]I just watched that.
[34:14.86]Why didn't I do anything?
[34:20.80]I know you're angry, but we don't have the luxury of playing it safe.
[34:24.90]Your brother understood that.
[34:27.44]Mason, we need your help.
[34:29.88]There's new info in your gorilla handbook that will be useful.
[34:33.38]New handbook.
[34:35.87]Yeah, I know I can play ship.
[34:37.19]That's fine.
[34:39.55]Alright, yeah, get off the screen.
[34:41.29]Okay.
[34:42.19]Uh, so I can do over here.
[34:44.81]What is this shit?
[34:49.04]Current location.
[34:49.82]Alright.
[34:52.06]Where's my fucking gorilla handbook?
[34:55.45]How do I open the gorilla handbook?
[34:58.86]The EDF's hold on each sector varies.
[35:01.88]Bring up your map to see the control value for each sector.
[35:05.42]Successfully completing guerrilla actions like raids drives control down.
[35:10.25]So does destroying EDF property, which is shown in red on your map.
[35:14.41]We've identified targets that are key to EDF operations.
[35:18.23]The ones marked as medium importance cause a bigger control drop when destroyed.
[35:23.01]A few are marked as high importance.
[35:25.47]Those require some planning before you hit them.
[35:28.50]Nice camera view.
[35:29.30]Mm-hmm.
[35:43.21]If we're going to defeat the EDF, we need the support of the people.
[35:46.67]To do that, we have to raise morale in each sector.
[35:50.27]Morale goes up as a complete guerrilla action.
[35:52.78]Destroy EDF propaganda and a few other things you'll discover along the way.
[35:57.14]However, when a colonist is killed, that sector's morale drops.
[36:01.88]So be careful.
[36:04.53]As morale in a sector increases, ammo crates will be better stocked and colonists will begin to fight alongside you.
[36:11.32]Also, the amount of salvage you get for completing a mission will increase if morale in the sector is high.
[36:17.06]Higher morale means more ammo, more help, and more salvage.
[36:21.15]Alright.
[36:22.45]I get you.
[36:24.03]Alright, let's do it.
[36:27.23]Let's go to the next mission.
[36:29.35]Next mission is over here.
[36:34.93]Obtain a red faction orders.
[36:36.77]Let's, you know, let's fucking destroy this shit.
[36:39.95]Let's destroy it.
[36:42.49]Why the fuck not, you know what I mean?
[36:45.71]Morale doesn't really matter.
[36:46.59]I mean, it kind of does.
[36:49.97]I'm gonna go ram that motherfucker.
[36:55.00]How's the audio?
[36:55.46]Are we too loud?
[37:03.32]Okay, so buildings that are red need to be destroyed.
[37:07.00]So that's awesome.
[37:10.57]These things need to be destroyed.
[37:13.05]Alright, easy.
[37:13.47]Just gotta get up there.
[37:17.49]Is this controlled by EDF?
[37:20.84]Huh.
[37:21.44]Okay.
[37:22.66]It's like you're sneaking above us.
[37:24.12]Right next to us?
[37:27.70]Are these bad guys?
[37:31.60]Like, I'm kind of confused with this whole thing.
[37:33.26]I am.
[37:38.08]What the hell am I thinking?
[37:42.40]That's how you do it.
[37:43.06]Alright, now we gotta be... We gotta, like, sneak... How do you... Is there a crouch?
[37:46.79]There is.
[37:53.25]I gotta sneak up here and just rig this place up.
[37:58.65]Turn the game volume down a little.
[38:00.71]Yeah, it is a little loud, ain't it?
[38:01.75]Let's go with, uh, let's go like... That's probably better.
[38:08.59]That's probably better.
[38:11.61]You don't even need to waste a charge.
[38:18.78]I can just shoot this, right?
[38:23.11]Holy God.
[38:23.87]Destroying EDF property drops EDF control.
[38:25.79]Liberate the sector by dropping control to zero and completing all missions.
[38:31.75]Oh my lord.
[38:32.91]Oh!
[38:36.12]I just got rolled out like a croissant.
[38:40.86]That was literally... Somebody rolled me like a fucking goddamn pastry.
[38:46.38]What is this?
[38:51.53]Crystal work the land or deposits can be destroyed to produce large amounts of salary Did I get it all Alright, well how do I pick up is it like salvage like everywhere right like run around and pick it up It's pretty sick
[39:19.31]We need as many people as we can get at the Red Rock outpost.
[39:22.95]Red Rock?
[39:23.27]Scouts say the EDF is about to mount an assault on the area.
[39:26.85]Alright, hold on.
[39:27.25]Let me just mine some ore for a minute.
[39:31.19]Look at the gorilla.
[39:31.77]Action on your map.
[39:33.17]Okay, hold on.
[39:33.71]I'll get there in a minute.
[39:38.11]It's 300 of these.
[39:39.61]I need to get a mount.
[39:44.52]Wait, hold on.
[39:45.20]EDF control.
[39:51.85]Come on!
[40:04.81]I'm gonna get fucking crossed every time.
[40:06.61]Oh.
[40:11.34]Oh, no!
[40:12.10]How far... Wait, did I do the mission already?
[40:15.50]Okay, we're good.
[40:17.56]We're good.
[40:17.90]We're good.
[40:18.20]We're good.
[40:22.71]What is this?
[40:23.41]House arrest.
[40:24.39]Rescue captured colonists.
[40:25.47]Let's do that.
[40:25.97]This game's fucking cool.
[40:28.34]I really like this game.
[40:31.40]It's just, it's kind of fun.
[40:34.82]It is.
[40:35.06]I don't think I'm ever going to be able to complete a destroy this mission in this game.
[40:45.05]I really don't think so.
[40:48.59]Every time I blow something up, I'm going to get hit by some random flying debris.
[40:52.95]What's that?
[40:55.48]I'm such a psycho right now, like completionist.
[40:58.02]That's a bad guy, right?
[40:58.72]I did my duty, right?
[41:16.23]Well, I don't think that's a good idea.
[41:20.42]I wouldn't just start shooting this... That's a bad fucking move!
[41:26.58]We're all gonna die!
[41:27.46]I'm gonna let him do it.
[41:34.75]How do you even spell debris?
[41:48.89]He's waiting for the joke, but the joke will come.
[41:52.03]Well, don't say that.
[41:52.83]Oh, oh, oh, that guy's, that guy's in deep shit.
[42:06.48]That guy was smart.
[42:16.62]Eat shit!
[42:28.19]What is this fucking thing?
[42:29.65]I need this, sir!
[42:36.56]It really is the cops.
[42:38.44]I'm driving in like a goofy like children's fucking cartoon show.
[42:45.44]Alright, we're going here.
[42:46.20]That's where we're going.
[42:46.86]We're going the right way.
[42:50.44]There we go.
[42:53.88]This is loud.
[42:54.26]You're too loud.
[42:58.65]Move, move!
[42:59.41]There's no way to go, move!
[43:00.33]I don't want to kill any of my civilian friends.
[43:07.53]Sick fucking baby toy truck.
[43:10.44]Propaganda.
[43:12.60]Take out that fucking propaganda.
[43:17.14]Alright, good.
[43:20.46]Now I gotta liberate this, like, help this place, right?
[43:24.66]Help gorillas fend off an EDF attack.
[43:26.96]Kill all EDF soldiers.
[43:30.50]Where are they?
[43:30.92]I don't see any EDF soldiers.
[43:35.18]I see, like, these people.
[43:39.63]They just flipped me off.
[43:43.11]Oh, there they are.
[43:43.89]I got this.
[43:56.38]We're winning.
[43:57.56]We're succeeding.
[43:58.36]The revolution is being taken into a... I can't even talk, sorry.
[44:08.73]What?
[44:13.59]What is Gothic 4?
[44:22.04]Fuck Gothic.
[44:24.93]This game is fucking where it's at, I'm telling you.
[44:30.11]We're not going to fuck around.
[44:31.37]Let's actually go do this.
[44:33.32]I'm not going to fuck around.
[44:37.42]We're going to do our part for the revolution.
[44:40.32]I'm not going to play any games.
[44:41.80]We're just going to do it.
[44:49.43]Set up a barrier.
[44:50.57]So when they come in, inevitably, when they try to come in, we have a barricade.
[44:55.31]Let's do it.
[45:00.97]Don't run in front of me.
[45:08.37]Where's my health?
[45:09.29]Okay, there it is.
[45:11.07]There's no, like, aim down sights or anything?
[45:17.27]Oh, I gotta get rid of this.
[45:18.11]This is controlled by the government.
[45:25.25]Okay, hopefully nobody got hit by any of that.
[45:30.49]What's this?
[45:32.39]Handgun?
[45:35.73]Who else is here?
[45:40.77]They don't show up on the mini-map.
[45:43.39]Left shift while going to cover.
[45:45.89]Okay, easy enough.
[45:46.89]That was a pretty sick flip.
[45:52.19]Get out of my spot, dude.
[45:55.20]I got this.
[46:00.86]Oh shit!
[46:02.82]Oh shit!
[46:12.10]I'm just being so fucking insane.
[46:15.70]We're winning.
[46:17.10]We're winning the fight.
[46:17.82]Get the guy on the top.
[46:25.55]Liberate them.
[46:30.69]Don't.
[46:31.07]Watch out for that.
[46:33.07]Only one guy left.
[46:33.77]Let's end this one in style.
[46:38.13]He's up here.
[46:42.87]That's how you end it in style.
[46:43.97]With a jumping fucking swing.
[46:46.89]Gorilla actions can drop EDF control and raise morale.
[46:49.57]There's no penalty for ignoring gorilla actions.
[46:51.13]Okay.
[46:51.23]Cool.
[46:53.82]Stock up.
[46:59.92]I think I have as much as I can carry, right?
[47:07.41]Pretty sure.
[47:10.97]I guess, I don't know.
[47:12.01]Do I have to actually collect this shit?
[47:13.65]I can't really... I have no idea.
[47:19.27]Thermos smash, yeah, pretty much.
[47:20.82]Does this guy have his hands cuffed?
[47:27.68]Alright, where are we going?
[47:29.84]Uh, we're right here.
[47:30.58]Might as well do it.
[47:32.66]What?
[47:33.12]What is this GPS?
[47:35.16]What the fuck was that?
[47:38.48]Oh.
[47:40.26]Uh, no GPS.
[47:41.24]I'm going to walk over there.
[47:43.04]From here.
[47:43.34]I'm going to smash through these oil pipes.
[47:49.41]And just go through and jump up.
[47:53.17]Completing a mission in Wards You Salvage...
[47:55.90]The higher morale is in the sector, the more salvage you receive.
[47:59.02]Keep sector morale high to earn large amounts of salvage.
[48:01.00]Cool.
[48:03.98]He's going to make me go all the way around.
[48:05.30]That's unfortunate.
[48:07.12]We received word that a high-ranking EDF officer is looking to defect.
[48:10.82]Alright.
[48:11.12]Bits, bits, bits, bits.
[48:12.08]Sorry.
[48:12.24]I'll get those in a second.
[48:13.66]I know she can handle herself, but she shouldn't have gone alone.
[48:16.62]After what happened at the old base, I'm not taking chances.
[48:20.17]Get to Sam as soon as you can.
[48:23.79]Alright, so let me see here.
[48:25.61]Uh, sorry I haven't been, like, reading any bits or paying attention.
[48:29.35]I'm, like, so happy to be playing this game.
[48:31.25]This game's fucking fantastic so far.
[48:34.07]Uh, so let me just see.
[48:35.79]DubskiDude, thanks for the five dollars.
[48:37.97]Uh, you watched my Bia impression video on stream last night, and I can't believe I missed it.
[48:43.58]Terrible luck.
[48:44.99]Someone was saying that they did it, which was lame, but it was super heartwarming seeing you laugh at my impression, especially after all the laughs you've given me over the years.
[48:53.07]Best streamer, best memes, best community.
[48:55.27]Yeah.
[48:56.03]Yeah.
[49:04.00]I couldn't have been more well-timed.
[49:07.16]Thanks a lot, though, Dubsky.
[49:08.14]It was fucking funny.
[49:14.98]Uh, coin on the rob.
[49:16.35]Thanks for the bits.
[49:17.77]I'm willing to bet money that you're going to drive into a small pole in the ground and your car is going to explode.
[49:21.87]Probably.
[49:25.05]The last, yeah, beacon.
[49:26.19]Uh, discount or discount, uh, discot.
[49:30.65]Thank you, discot DMV for the $9.
[49:34.19]Craygasm, craygasm, craygasm.
[49:36.75]Get ready for one of the best games you'll ever play, calling it now.
[49:39.19]Alright, you can call it.
[49:39.91]That was like from 20 minutes ago.
[49:42.56]Never Trust a Purple, thanks for the bits.
[49:44.54]Monty the Moose, thanks for the bits too.
[49:46.94]And I think I'm caught up.
[49:50.66]Does the money you donate go to the BF fund?
[49:52.86]It all goes to the BF fund.
[49:55.52]I'm under BF protection right now.
[49:57.86]I gotta pay hundreds of thousands of dollars a month in BF protection.
[50:03.16]There's like 600 million of them.
[50:04.74]How am I supposed to keep up with that?
[50:05.86]Alright, get to Sam as soon as I can.
[50:08.86]Sounds like a plan.
[50:12.10]Where's my car?
[50:15.38]I don't have a car.
[50:18.66]Can't use weapons while sprinting?
[50:19.92]That's bullshit, because I just did.
[50:23.71]Uh, do you remember picking a number between 1 and 5?
[50:30.73]1.
[50:30.91]Propaganda.
[50:32.31]Solar.
[50:33.93]Solar is too expensive.
[50:36.69]It's not even that sustainable.
[50:38.27]Propaganda.
[50:40.57]We need to go back to gas.
[50:43.65]I work for the fucking gas company.
[50:46.69]This is propaganda.
[50:57.29]Go back to coal.
[51:05.50]I didn't read your bits?
[51:06.42]Fuck!
[51:07.18]That means I have to alt-tab.
[51:08.60]I'll get him in a minute.
[51:12.28]Sellout streamer?
[51:13.66]No, I'm just kidding.
[51:18.14]Protect Sam from the EDF.
[51:19.62]Alright.
[51:26.16]You didn't know that I was also a double agent!
[51:28.10]This is gas!
[51:30.36]Fuck you!
[51:32.74]Environment is where it's at!
[51:36.33]Double agent what you don't know is I'm a double agent working for nuclear Take this gas company Oh
[52:02.75]A colonist has taken up arms and joined the red faction.
[52:04.67]As sect morale increases, more colonists will join you in a fight.
[52:08.29]Who needs a gun?
[52:11.01]I owe you.
[52:12.86]This is one hell of an operation you guys are running.
[52:16.56]The EDF will send reinforcements.
[52:18.16]Dude, nobody is safe from the nuclear hammer maniac.
[52:21.84]We can't do both?
[52:22.60]Oh my god.
[52:33.97]Get the fuck out of the way.
[52:36.85]How dare you walk in the way.
[52:38.05]Well, if you kill a colonist, you can betray their trust and the moral drop is larger.
[52:41.23]Well, whatever.
[52:41.87]Just get out of the way.
[52:42.67]We're trying to have a cutscene here.
[52:43.87]Let's get this shit.
[52:44.81]Ammo crate.
[52:46.55]Take some of that ammo.
[52:47.53]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[52:48.25]I think it just does it automatically.
[52:51.68]What's in here?
[53:03.12]Prepare for the EDF.
[53:05.44]Alright, let's set up some stuff here.
[53:08.22]No!
[53:08.50]I was trying to... I was trying to pick it up.
[53:12.08]Oh, fuck me.
[53:12.88]I was trying to pick up the hydrogen bomb.
[53:19.03]Right-clicking, apparently, in my brain.
[53:20.99]E didn't do it, and F didn't do it.
[53:22.31]What button is it?
[53:25.99]What is this?
[53:26.35]I have to destroy this?
[53:40.82]How do you pick shit up?
[53:42.78]Is it E?
[53:44.08]F?
[53:44.54]No, F zooms in.
[53:45.48]Why is that the button?
[53:47.50]What is it?
[53:49.16]F is zoom.
[53:50.50]Q?
[53:51.14]No, Q is that.
[53:55.21]E?
[53:55.53]I can't pick anything up with E.
[53:58.62]Don't even matter, we're gonna fucking win with a landslide victory.
[54:11.80]Wait.
[54:15.10]Okay, they come down this road.
[54:18.32]It's that easy.
[54:22.91]It's that easy.
[54:29.81]These guys are on top of each other.
[54:34.41]How are you guys still alive?
[54:40.81]Dude, it's so fun just frisbeeing these things.
[54:49.80]Oh, frisbeeing this shit is so much fun.
[54:55.72]Hey, solo salvage, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[54:59.28]This really is just demo.
[55:01.38]Alright, they lost more influence.
[55:03.66]Reduce EDF control to zero to unlock the next mission and liberate the... Okay, so I gotta like... I gotta like go around and like just destroy shit and get this to zero.
[55:12.42]So... Let's do it.
[55:16.32]Pull on ammo.
[55:18.26]Pull on pretty much everything I need.
[55:19.48]Let's just get out.
[55:20.36]Where's that car?
[55:22.52]Collect some more scrap metal.
[55:24.80]Combine it.
[55:25.50]Maybe I'll get a fucking... Maybe I'll get a Troubleman's Tribbley.
[55:28.34]Whatever that hat is.
[55:29.41]I can't wait to combine all my scrap and get a fucking Troublemaker's Tribbley.
[55:39.43]What's this?
[55:42.66]Uses a reference point for travel.
[55:49.04]Okay, let's go there.
[55:52.47]I kind of want to just do it all.
[55:53.87]Whoa, look at me thread that needle.
[55:55.33]A TF2 joke.
[56:01.10]I mean, sometimes we have to make them, right?
[56:03.46]I can't pretend I didn't play that game for like five years of my life.
[56:08.20]Alright, uh, what's this?
[56:16.05]A computer?
[56:16.67]To do this job right, pay attention to your surroundings and use what's in
[56:21.24]Hydrogen tanks are your best friend.
[56:22.55]Bring down that old habitat.
[56:24.33]So I gotta use my pistol and the hydrogen bombs.
[56:29.05]Sounds fun.
[56:35.61]I got a few minutes.
[56:37.92]Let's throw it in there.
[56:39.86]Throw it in.
[56:42.24]Oh, man.
[56:43.38]Fill these water tanks.
[56:44.40]This is gonna be fun.
[56:47.42]Get like two here.
[56:50.63]And then try to get someone in the upstairs window.
[56:56.75]Well, maybe not.
[56:57.34]No, I'm gonna go for like a... Can I climb the ladder?
[57:03.38]No, not anymore.
[57:04.64]Can I throw it into that top building there?
[57:07.62]Oh, God.
[57:08.42]No, what the... Where the fuck did that go?
[57:13.67]That's gone.
[57:14.25]Okay, like I said, God took that one.
[57:18.03]That one ascended.
[57:21.09]Jesus Christ.
[57:28.29]Got it.
[57:31.39]We got time.
[57:31.75]We got like two minutes.
[57:41.11]Shit.
[57:42.15]Sorry.
[57:42.42]We'll put that.
[57:42.78]That one's there.
[57:43.50]At least we got it.
[57:48.72]Might as well use them all.
[57:50.34]This is like the easy one, right?
[57:52.14]What the hell were you doing?
[57:53.00]I was aiming very clearly right there.
[57:58.48]This should do it.
[57:59.06]Maybe one like over this way.
[58:01.74]That was perfect.
[58:02.46]It's exactly where I wanted it.
[58:09.83]I'm trying to get one more in that window.
[58:13.38]Right in there.
[58:15.56]Got it.
[58:16.40]Alright, we're ready.
[58:17.86]Hopefully this works.
[58:19.40]Let's shoot this one.
[58:21.74]And then this one.
[58:28.90]Okay, well, that... That... That didn't set off a reaction.
[58:35.02]I thought it was going to be a chain reaction.
[58:37.54]But we didn't... Okay.
[58:39.69]Didn't get a chain reaction.
[58:43.11]Okay, that was underwhelming it sure was What's going on here?
[58:59.54]What's with the chain?
[59:00.08]Where's the chain reaction?
[59:02.70]I've taken out like the whole thing There it is
[59:09.55]Thank you.
[59:10.44]I almost fucking died from that.
[59:11.74]That almost hit me right in the head.
[59:12.60]This thing's still not dead.
[59:13.34]Okay, I got it.
[59:16.52]I swear to God, if that thing had come down and crushed my skull, I would have lost my fucking mind.
[59:20.62]No, you're supposed to do it fast.
[59:23.37]Whatever, I did it.
[59:27.37]Two gorilla actions complete.
[59:30.93]Or additive unlocked.
[59:31.93]Visit the upgrade table to purchase unlocked weapons and upgrades.
[59:34.44]Cool.
[59:36.82]Not this.
[59:38.52]Okay.
[59:42.56]Demolition master.
[59:45.12]What is up here?
[59:45.68]Oh, there's a war up here.
[59:46.38]Can I get up there?
[59:50.64]It's in like a really weird spot.
[59:51.94]I don't think I can get it.
[59:54.26]Where's my car?
[59:54.72]Let's go.
[60:01.21]Do it fast, baby.
[60:05.57]Is this game repetitive?
[60:06.65]I mean, I could see how it might, but... It could get there.
[60:11.11]Let's do... We're on the way.
[60:12.29]What is this one?
[60:14.15]It's another navigation beacon.
[60:15.57]This is the home... Let's go home base.
[60:17.49]Let's, like, deposit our shit.
[60:24.18]Easy.
[60:27.22]I see ore right here.
[60:31.03]Let's get some... Number one.
[60:34.08]There it is.
[60:37.38]Three of three hundred.
[60:40.72]Three hundred scrap materials, which is good.
[60:44.72]There's one right here, too.
[60:52.71]Now we got three hundred.
[60:55.45]Nice.
[60:58.30]Go get the jet pack.
[61:00.46]Something tells me we're a little early for the jetpack.
[61:04.52]Because of the upgrades, it does not get repetitive.
[61:07.32]I can see myself very much enjoying this game.
[61:10.65]So, I'm, uh... I'm down to play this.
[61:14.59]I'm totally down.
[61:16.03]Alright, where's the person that I need to... Where's the upgrade lady up here?
[61:22.03]Alright.
[61:27.31]What do you got for me?
[61:28.51]Uh, remote charge count.
[61:30.05]I can do three charges.
[61:32.62]This one is more ammo for the charges.
[61:34.96]This one is the arc welder.
[61:39.04]Salvage collector.
[61:40.72]Sorry, arc welder or more charges?
[61:43.77]Which one?
[61:48.57]I feel like more charges is smarter, but arc welder is a lightning gun.
[61:55.54]Like, this one's the smart idea.
[61:59.40]We're going to do this one.
[62:03.66]Yeah, I want to do it.
[62:04.86]Why is cancel the first thing?
[62:09.29]Zapgun's fun, but yeah, I feel like we can do this again.
[62:11.83]We're going to do it again.
[62:12.99]This is four charges.
[62:15.15]This is five charges.
[62:17.61]Yeah.
[62:19.77]I mean, like, let's be real.
[62:21.73]Having five charges out is so much better.
[62:25.20]We'll stick with that for a little while.
[62:30.27]You're going to choose anyways why ask us?
[62:31.85]I mean, most of you guys said... We can get the zap gun, don't worry.
[62:38.09]But we can have five charges out.
[62:40.89]That's devastating.
[62:43.35]The arc welder is extremely weak.
[62:44.94]I never used it.
[62:47.00]Five is better than two, that's right.
[62:49.32]Alright, we got 18.
[62:49.88]18!
[62:49.90]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[62:57.69]Let's take a look at the map.
[63:01.55]Alright, we have 31 morale and 110 EDF points.
[63:05.53]Let's just go over here.
[63:06.65]Let's just blow this place up.
[63:07.61]Let's destroy this place.
[63:08.45]Pull it out.
[63:12.07]What the fuck?
[63:17.36]Team HUD fix got any finger achievement?
[63:19.70]What the fuck?
[63:20.30]Why is the console out here?
[63:23.80]There's a console in this game?
[63:34.19]cheater.
[63:35.09]I didn't even know I opened it.
[63:41.49]God damn it.
[63:43.93]This car is too big.
[63:45.89]Wait, we got, look at all this shit.
[63:47.45]Look at all this EDF bullshit.
[63:51.86]Alright, let's play this one correctly.
[63:56.10]Let's get this one smart.
[63:57.80]We're gonna hammer the guy at the front door, charge the place up, boom, collect the salvage, get the fuck out.
[64:11.48]One, two, three, four, and five.
[64:23.47]Oh!
[64:32.14]Whoa, that was not smart.
[64:46.23]OH GO GO!
[64:48.09]OH MY Jesus Christ!
[64:53.32]The entire game just came after me!
[64:55.94]Holy shit!
[64:59.20]Oh this one guy!
[65:00.19]Oh no!
[65:01.47]One of my friends!
[65:16.31]There's a buggy over here.
[65:16.91]Oh, dude, it's like a thousand people chasing me.
[65:19.74]How do I get in the stupid, like, subterranean vehicle?
[65:23.08]Quick!
[65:26.70]Get out of the fucking way!
[65:33.62]You dumbass!
[65:35.26]Out of the way!
[65:40.24]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[65:41.38]I gotta blow this up too.
[65:42.06]Quick!
[65:49.59]Get in!
[65:50.57]Get in!
[66:00.96]Get in!
[66:08.39]Save yourselves!
[66:10.11]Save yourselves!
[66:11.51]Save yourselves!
[66:12.11]Get out of the way!
[66:13.77]Move!
[66:18.59]EDF eat shit.
[66:20.30]Get liberated.
[66:38.42]Bada bing!
[66:47.07]Where's your moral support now, motherfucker?
[66:58.70]I need to, like, calm down.
[67:02.73]Are you a bad guy?
[67:07.99]Oh, I just kinda fucked up this whole place.
[67:09.51]Oh well.
[67:12.05]So many people coming.
[67:12.77]Quick, quick, quick.
[67:13.63]What do I do?
[67:13.97]I don't know what to do here.
[67:25.83]Fucking maniac.
[67:28.23]You're fucking with a maniac.
[67:30.67]He's trying to do like a karate kick.
[67:39.63]Is your morale, drop the morale, baby.
[67:48.14]I hereby claim this settlement liberated.
[67:56.14]Who wants the first slice of pizza?
[67:57.86]Not right.
[68:05.88]Alright, we're down to 85.
[68:10.23]I'm having a ton of fun.
[68:12.85]Gotta aim down sights with F. Oh yeah, that's true.
[68:15.65]Who's shooting?
[68:16.53]Who dares to try to shoot me with a gun?
[68:21.24]Oh, fuck.
[68:26.05]Yeah, I gotta change that to like a different click.
[68:27.83]That sucks.
[68:40.08]That guy's in the way!
[68:40.68]Shoot that!
[68:41.34]What?
[68:41.60]I can't shoot that thing?
[68:47.91]Did I just get beeped at?
[68:53.57]Out of bullets.
[68:54.49]Oh, dear.
[68:54.91]This is not good.
[68:56.25]Where's my handgun?
[69:00.51]Last guy.
[69:00.91]Where'd you go?
[69:01.39]Behind the... Shit.
[69:07.70]Are these guys never gonna stop coming?
[69:14.60]I think I gotta get out of here.
[69:18.80]Yeah, I gotta get out of here.
[69:19.68]They're never gonna stop coming over here.
[69:24.78]What's this?
[69:25.92]Ooh, ammo machine.
[69:29.30]Is this what that is?
[69:29.84]I don't know.
[69:30.50]I gotta go.
[69:30.72]Look at that jump.
[69:37.68]They all know where I'm going.
[69:49.10]I gotta get rid of that.
[69:52.47]That guy's got a fucking powerful gun.
[70:04.12]I'm just a madman on the loose.
[70:06.56]Break it!
[70:07.06]Come on, get me through here.
[70:10.34]Break it!
[70:11.76]Where's the fucking collision destruction?
[70:16.48]I'm like a rat in a cage here.
[70:21.82]Oh!
[70:26.58]Shit.
[70:31.00]Oh my god.
[70:34.33]Oh, that's so sneaky if I can get in here.
[70:38.27]Look at this sneaky shit.
[70:49.26]Oh!
[70:53.58]I thought I was so sneaky about that.
[70:59.13]There's just an alarm going off constantly.
[71:03.10]Come on!
[71:05.18]Don't let the PvP asshole take my ore!
[71:11.94]Dude, I just can't escape.
[71:15.53]Okay, get in the car.
[71:16.91]I gotta escape.
[71:21.47]Alright, there we go.
[71:28.91]There's ore on the ground.
[71:29.81]I can't get it though.
[71:30.83]I gotta get away from this.
[71:31.75]Look at all this fucking... Look at all this ore.
[71:38.23]Look at the minefield.
[71:39.09]I just gotta... Look at this ore field.
[71:40.31]Holy shit.
[71:44.99]This is... We're just non-stopping.
[71:46.27]We're like times a thousand here, guys.
[71:52.40]I'm still being chased, but I'm not gonna be for long.
[71:59.16]So cool.
[72:00.18]What a fun game.
[72:06.52]Hello?
[72:07.82]What the hell was that?
[72:11.37]Are they up on the bridge?
[72:16.97]They are up on the bridge.
[72:17.93]That guy's not going to drive down here, is he?
[72:21.55]I can hear the car.
[72:26.99]If that dude careens over the edge, I'm gonna lose my mind.
[72:30.30]See, look, there he is.
[72:34.50]What are you doing, man?
[72:36.80]That's like another player driving the car.
[72:41.79]I think we're good.
[72:48.55]Here he comes.
[72:54.86]Yeah, no more alert.
[72:55.80]We're good.
[72:56.73]Made it out of that one alive.
[72:57.69]Yep.
[73:03.39]Don't you guys know?
[73:05.83]This is just Saints Row 4 without the superpowers.
[73:09.21]Oh, no, no.
[73:10.15]I played Saints Row.
[73:11.49]This is like... It sounds like an addictive game.
[73:16.49]I like it.
[73:16.83]This is a very, very... I really like this game.
[73:22.68]Something told me that I was gonna like this game a lot.
[73:25.42]And, like, you know, sometimes you have that feeling.
[73:27.53]And the game's not that fun.
[73:29.63]It's like, eh, it's alright.
[73:30.89]But this is fun.
[73:33.03]This is fucking fun.
[73:35.40]Might get repetitive when we get, like, up here.
[73:37.20]But...
[73:39.41]I'm having a great time.
[73:45.17]I guess we gotta go... Where am I right now?
[73:47.53]Up here.
[73:48.89]I'm not doing that.
[73:49.59]I want to go destroy this shit.
[73:50.85]We want to bring this to zero.
[73:52.43]What is this?
[73:53.33]Kind of like time trial?
[73:55.03]Get the vehicle to a safe house.
[73:57.88]No, let's just get along here.
[74:00.90]Demolitions master.
[74:02.40]Earn salvage and take your destruction skills.
[74:04.24]Let's do this one.
[74:06.94]Why would I go that way?
[74:08.12]I'm right here.
[74:09.99]This GPS is insane.
[74:13.45]I need to, like, just turn around.
[74:14.61]I like Gothic 2 more.
[74:18.47]Um, yeah, yeah, because I'm in, like, the bunker.
[74:24.22]I've got to reliably get out of here.
[74:29.90]That's not how you do it.
[74:30.68]Now we're gonna have to go back.
[74:32.64]There we go.
[74:38.86]I'm gonna have to, like, just get up here.
[74:40.13]Oh, there's another ore.
[74:43.33]Free Fire Zone.
[74:44.03]This is the EDF Free Fire Zone.
[74:45.55]Unauthorized personnel will be fired upon.
[74:47.25]Stare clear of this area until the red faction has a plan to get through.
[74:53.71]Well, I don't see anybody, so what the hell are you so afraid of?
[75:03.28]What are you so scared of?
[75:04.92]Ain't nobody here.
[75:09.18]I guess I could just do this.
[75:10.81]Right?
[75:11.65]I mean, this is a mission.
[75:12.45]It's to drive a car.
[75:13.23]I'm here.
[75:14.57]Where do I have to take it to?
[75:18.85]Drive this vehicle to the designated safe house within the time limit.
[75:21.17]Watch out for EDF.
[75:25.16]Oh, Christ.
[75:25.82]I have to get this here in a minute?
[75:29.04]I have one minute?
[75:31.34]And 30 seconds to get there.
[75:36.37]Is this even possible?
[75:41.49]Where are the Gothic 3 patches?
[75:43.09]Game sucks.
[75:43.97]Once I get to the main road, it might be possible.
[75:51.45]I don't know, man.
[75:52.27]60 seconds.
[75:54.47]Gotta go fast.
[76:02.35]Give me Mercenaries 1.
[76:03.61]I actually wanted to play Mercenaries on stream.
[76:08.32]But I couldn't get it to run.
[76:10.04]There was something wrong with it.
[76:12.90]There was a specific purpose as to why I couldn't play Mercenaries.
[76:17.40]And I wanted to.
[76:20.64]Entering.
[76:21.08]Here we go.
[76:21.44]Come on.
[76:22.49]Almost there.
[76:23.65]38 seconds.
[76:25.79]Hopefully this is not EDF in the weird buggy car.
[76:31.21]Prisonaries is just as fun.
[76:33.97]I can see that.
[76:36.44]Don't tip the damn thing.
[76:40.82]Fuck the speed limit.
[76:41.54]I don't know if I'm going to get there.
[76:44.30]I don't know if I'm going to get there.
[76:46.42]15 seconds.
[76:46.86]They don't fuck around with this shit.
[76:49.59]It's going to be right to the wire.
[76:51.75]Nine?
[76:53.75]Jesus.
[76:57.29]Good job.
[76:57.73]We'll get to work on it right away.
[77:02.77]Pro time, target time, best time.
[77:06.93]The hell are you supposed to do that?
[77:08.27]Alright, nice.
[77:12.38]Cool.
[77:16.98]Finish big rigs over the road racing.
[77:19.66]Um, fellas, ladies and gentlemen, I'm never playing that game ever again.
[77:25.30]Why would I ever play big rigs over the road racing?
[77:28.13]I played it for 25 minutes and I saw every single thing the game had to offer and I wanted to die.
[77:34.07]They're making a new game, right?
[77:37.02]Isn't there a weird creepy fucked up thing with a new game that he might or might not be working on right now?
[77:45.60]Can I do anything else?
[77:47.60]Let's see.
[77:48.92]Ore.
[77:50.05]Two extra salvage per ore deposit.
[77:53.01]Pick up salvagement in a vehicle.
[77:55.41]Let's get this.
[77:57.41]Glad I could help.
[78:00.90]25.
[78:01.02]Pick up.
[78:01.32]Let's do this too.
[78:02.68]Just to have it.
[78:03.20]Cool.
[78:03.46]Very cool.
[78:04.74]Get more.
[78:10.20]Salvage.
[78:13.27]Finish antechamber.
[78:14.35]Did you honestly just bring up antechamber?
[78:18.87]Holy shit.
[78:20.67]What's this one?
[78:22.13]It's a navigation beacon.
[78:23.29]What is this one?
[78:25.83]Rescue capture.
[78:26.79]Didn't I do this?
[78:27.37]Let's do this again.
[78:30.78]I think I might have, like, failed that one or something.
[78:33.98]Uh, this is kind of in the way.
[78:34.86]Am I gonna stream or EDF?
[78:44.15]No, isn't there a new EDF?
[78:46.25]Or am I making that up?
[78:47.47]Is there, like, an EDF, like, 5 coming out or something?
[78:51.01]Wasn't there, like, something about that?
[78:53.07]Maybe I'd play it later.
[79:00.14]I'd rather not die.
[79:01.16]Alright, so I'm not just like... That's not like a dream I had.
[79:08.61]That like actually is happening on PS4.
[79:10.41]It's only a Japanese game.
[79:13.71]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[79:17.19]Did that game just not do well at all?
[79:19.13]Like in the States?
[79:21.07]Is that what the problem is?
[79:24.05]And they brought it up stateside.
[79:25.01]It's just... People just didn't care or what?
[79:34.46]More salvage.
[79:35.72]I'll take it all.
[79:36.94]So am I doing this right?
[79:39.19]Is it right once it's kind of destroyed initially, you just get it?
[79:42.71]It's not like you have to completely knock the hell out of it?
[79:45.43]Or is it just like a few times is enough to get everything?
[79:52.68]Like, is that enough?
[79:53.94]Like, once it just crumbles down, that's all you gotta do, right?
[79:57.87]Yeah, okay, cool.
[80:03.59]Alright, let's do this one.
[80:05.15]Free the hostages.
[80:05.69]Yeah, they could use a hand, you free Mason.
[80:07.49]So that's up here.
[80:08.14]Sure, let's do it.
[80:08.70]We gotta get all the hostages.
[80:09.82]No messing around.
[80:10.60]While we have a second, let me read some bits.
[80:34.30]Uh, never trust purple, thanks to the bits.
[80:36.60]Yes, EDF5 is releasing on PC eventually.
[80:39.20]It looks really polished.
[80:40.46]Also, try crossing the free fire zone for a funny joke.
[80:46.66]Didn't I just do that?
[80:47.33]I thought I, like, went across the free, like, area.
[80:51.65]Anyways, thanks, dude.
[80:52.89]Thanks, holeof1zombie for the bits.
[80:54.31]I got a dollar for you, got a crowbar, because if I give you a dollar, you could give me a crowbar, and I'll give you a dollar.
[80:59.11]Then I'll have a crowbar, and you will have a dollar.
[81:02.76]I don't... I don't even own a crowbar.
[81:06.60]Thanks, dude.
[81:08.92]Also, thanks to Luke the Loot Breaker.
[81:12.16]Take my bits, boy.
[81:13.10]This is the last time I will ask for a full-screen face cam.
[81:16.03]I need to see your dental that comes with the job.
[81:17.95]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[81:20.67]Webcam ain't even plugged in.
[81:22.89]Can't do it.
[81:25.71]So... Let's get up here.
[81:27.67]Okay.
[81:31.39]Three... sneak in here.
[81:34.73]So we got hostages to take care of.
[81:42.45]Real sneaky.
[81:45.96]The number of hostages, okay.
[81:49.26]I don't want to break anything.
[81:50.06]I don't want to blow anything up.
[81:54.50]I'm gonna die.
[81:55.24]I'm going to die.
[82:01.55]Good stealth gameplay.
[82:02.77]Is that a hostage?
[82:04.70]Oh, one of my gorillas was killed.
[82:07.50]Okay.
[82:13.00]Where is he at?
[82:14.34]That guy just slid and hit his head on the wall.
[82:16.72]That guy died.
[82:18.82]Did you see that shit?
[82:19.44]That guy slid and smashed his head on the wall and died.
[82:23.00]For real?
[82:32.05]Remind me after this.
[82:33.21]Actually, I'll do it right now.
[82:35.63]Aim down sights has got to be something else.
[82:39.15]Controls.
[82:40.97]Button controls, okay.
[82:43.21]Primary attack, melee attack.
[82:46.14]You know, let's make melee attack like this.
[82:54.08]Yes, accept that.
[82:55.18]That's melee.
[82:57.64]Make that... So then I want right mouse to be aimed down sights.
[83:03.59]Zoom will be right mouse button.
[83:07.69]That's better.
[83:10.69]Accept it.
[83:11.49]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[83:12.21]Let's see if that's any better.
[83:17.05]Yeah, that's so much better.
[83:19.13]You can actually aim down sights and do it without a problem.
[83:29.28]Alright, should I Kool-Aid man?
[83:32.11]I'm gonna Kool-Aid man through the wall.
[83:33.43]And save everybody, watch this.
[83:35.45]Alright, come!
[83:40.65]Holy fuck, that was close.
[83:42.61]I don't know why I couldn't hit him.
[83:50.95]Oh, it's because I changed it.
[83:52.01]Alright, I get it, I get it.
[83:54.70]Where?
[83:56.94]Where are they?
[83:57.86]Are you inside the computer?
[84:09.15]That was a double kill.
[84:10.73]Where are they?
[84:13.65]Where are the hostages?
[84:14.73]Oh, there's one hostage.
[84:15.99]That's it?
[84:18.09]Oh.
[84:22.11]Hold on a minute.
[84:22.61]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[84:23.25]How many hostages are in here?
[84:28.90]Am I gonna get this person out of here?
[84:32.96]Oh, shit.
[84:36.90]Don't come out here.
[84:44.50]There was only... The other one was killed.
[84:49.72]Yeah, come on down.
[84:50.24]I'm worried you're getting lost.
[84:58.66]Don't fucking trip and die, please.
[85:01.24]Are you a hostage?
[85:08.50]Oh shit.
[85:13.52]Gotta make this work.
[85:16.61]I came one per... Alright, we're gonna take the armored car.
[85:23.32]We have one hostage in here.
[85:26.30]The turret will auto-aim to the closest enemy.
[85:28.16]Press to manually aim the turret.
[85:30.66]You cannot drive while manually aiming the turret.
[85:34.92]But she's going to use the gun?
[85:39.94]Um... Now I have like a little co-op thing here.
[85:46.29]I can't aim that.
[85:47.15]That's her.
[85:49.85]Oh my god.
[85:51.39]You're gonna get killed.
[85:52.19]I just ran over a person.
[85:55.53]I ran one of the people over.
[85:56.57]One of the civilians.
[86:01.37]What a totally not useless person.
[86:03.15]That's awesome.
[86:09.13]Put on the Etalyx soundboard.
[86:15.87]You're welcome.
[86:18.22]Now get to work!
[86:30.44]Alright, good.
[86:33.98]Just smash the door.
[86:36.31]I was afraid it was gonna bounce back and kill me.
[86:39.83]Alrighty.
[86:40.87]What else we got?
[86:44.17]I wanted to go up here, right?
[86:47.28]There's a couple of ways to go.
[86:48.58]This is a big complex.
[86:49.68]This will be worth a lot.
[86:50.90]Let me get a drink.
[86:51.42]I want to fill up my coffee.
[86:55.58]I'll be right back in like two minutes.
[86:57.77]Give me a sec.
[87:00.05]Let me save it just in case something fucking horrible goes wrong here.
[87:03.33]Because I've gotten past the beginning port of the game.
[87:07.33]Beginning port of the game.
[87:08.33]I'll be right back.
[87:09.59]Go get a drink.
[87:10.09]Go refill your coffee.
[87:11.24]Go refill your snacks.
[87:12.68]See you in a second.
[90:01.85]Hi there.
[90:34.85]That's good.
[90:35.57]Let's turn this back on.
[90:40.19]I'm back.
[90:43.85]And I'm ready to play.
[90:44.87]But I need to do this because every time you alt-tab, you know, it goes out of full screen.
[90:54.29]What are you doing here?
[91:00.70]Why can't I change this?
[91:02.98]Display.
[91:04.85]Why can I not change this now?
[91:12.85]That's weird.
[91:15.07]I could change that before, remember?
[91:17.25]Need to be on the main menu?
[91:18.57]Oh, fuck, really?
[91:23.15]Alright, give me a second.
[91:27.32]I have it saved right there.
[91:28.10]There we go, main menu.
[91:31.42]That's annoying.
[91:38.62]Mm-hmm.
[91:40.94]I don't think Alt-Enter does anything.
[91:44.00]So, I saved it right there.
[91:49.77]Oh, fuck.
[91:50.77]I really... And, like, the... Oh, no, I got it.
[91:54.81]We're good.
[91:55.03]We're good.
[91:55.63]Okay.
[91:58.13]Jerma EXE has experienced a run-time error.
[92:00.55]Eh, sometimes.
[92:01.12]Alright, let's keep going.
[92:02.16]Nice burp, dude.
[92:08.36]Nice burp.
[92:08.94]Here we go.
[92:09.84]Up here.
[92:11.22]Let's destroy this whole place.
[92:13.30]Get in my car.
[92:16.18]Let me get in this fucking car.
[92:19.76]God, the Boston accent.
[92:20.72]Like, the real Boston.
[92:21.92]I don't have a real Boston accent, guys.
[92:25.14]I have a Boston accent, but it's not real.
[92:28.38]It's like a...
[92:38.72]Wear your seatbelt next time.
[92:41.72]The dangers of the automotive world.
[92:43.26]They're not going to fucking tell me to fuck off.
[93:10.75]No more propaganda.
[93:14.52]Oh, fucking Boston.
[93:17.18]No.
[93:17.94]High importance target.
[93:19.04]Wait, wait, wait.
[93:19.66]I'm going to explain some stuff.
[93:22.31]Buildings marked with this icon are key to the EDF presence in the sector.
[93:24.95]They're heavily protected but hold a large amount of EDF control.
[93:29.05]Yes, yes, yes.
[93:30.19]I'm aware.
[93:30.83]That's why we're going to do a little sneak attack.
[93:34.98]Anyways.
[93:36.63]There's like the thick Boston accent, and then there's like my Boston accent.
[93:42.26]When people talk about like cars, and this fucking guy, I'm telling you, this fucking guy driving his car around, he's a fucking stupid fucking idiot.
[93:49.25]That's like the gross Boston accent.
[93:51.19]I don't have that one.
[93:54.25]Dude, I got this fucking hammer.
[93:55.71]I'm gonna drop this fucking hammer on this guy's fucking skull.
[93:57.93]It's gonna be so fucking cool, dude.
[94:00.40]That's the one that you don't want.
[94:03.46]And speaking of things that you don't want to have happen.
[94:05.63]How's your skull after this one, buddy?
[94:09.83]That would have been so cool if it actually... I did right-click.
[94:13.27]Oh, fuck.
[94:15.33]Right-click is not that melee.
[94:16.77]It's this other mouse button.
[94:17.81]That would have been awesome.
[94:19.93]You guys would have been so happy about that.
[94:22.39]And now I'm fucked.
[94:27.78]Looks like the drones don't appreciate what we've been doing to the place.
[94:30.68]They're about to attack the Parker dorms.
[94:45.53]Oh, whoops.
[94:47.98]I might have to restart this shit because I like to try to do like a dumb like... Yeah, we're gonna have to restart it.
[94:57.34]I'm just gonna restart that.
[95:01.40]I got too caught up in that bullshit and I'm just gonna do it again.
[95:09.45]Can we fucking hit a guy?
[95:10.64]Let's just square one.
[95:14.60]Easy.
[95:21.21]Redo the jump attack.
[95:22.07]No, no, no.
[95:23.27]I gotta sneak in there and drop charges.
[95:25.81]That's a highly protected place.
[95:33.10]Caught up in my own propaganda.
[95:38.91]I could just do like the battlefield thing, right?
[95:42.49]And throw C4 all over this thing and just drive it in there, dive off and press the button.
[95:47.43]You know what?
[95:50.65]You know... It might not be the worst idea in the world.
[95:57.03]No, it is a bad idea.
[95:58.45]That's a dumb idea.
[96:02.73]Just get up here and then... Sneak in the front door.
[96:10.02]This guy's not suspicious.
[96:11.12]Now he is.
[96:11.54]Let's see what I can do here.
[96:12.86]This guy actually didn't care, apparently.
[96:21.84]Alright, well this is my chance.
[96:22.96]I gotta get up here.
[96:27.75]And then we're gonna use this to get out.
[96:35.83]Here we go.
[96:43.98]And boom!
[96:47.02]Still not done?
[96:49.44]Damn it!
[96:50.62]Damn it!
[96:51.00]Come on!
[96:51.30]Put the curses right there, dude!
[97:02.56]Get it out of here!
[97:05.24]Explosions everywhere!
[97:06.18]Come on!
[97:06.48]I gotta destroy this left side!
[97:09.18]Oh no!
[97:10.82]Oh no!
[97:12.14]Oh no!
[97:14.09]Give me that ammo.
[97:24.88]I need a little bit more.
[97:25.66]Come on, come on, come on.
[97:26.18]Open it.
[97:29.68]Got it.
[97:37.98]There that one goes.
[97:38.86]Take out this.
[97:40.71]Did I just miss every fucking time?
[97:46.73]Done alright this one's done almost do Come on what the fuck this cursor like doesn't even go the right spot oh Fuck that's a that was a good person Get it yep, holy shit that guy's got a gun oh
[98:16.40]No, seriously, like, get out of my way!
[98:20.52]Get in the car!
[98:22.43]Oh, put your fucking fuck off.
[98:24.85]Alright, we liberated that one.
[98:25.85]Now we can do- we got zero, now we can keep going on the mission.
[98:30.55]Sounds good.
[98:35.64]There's a lot of scrap back there.
[98:36.76]Yeah, but there's- I- I- A lot of people, man.
[98:40.48]Like, I- that didn't go well for me.
[98:52.36]There'll be plenty of opportunity for scrap, don't worry.
[98:57.38]Alright, this person, did you run behind me the whole time?
[99:02.17]What are you thinking?
[99:04.61]How do you unlock Mewtwo?
[99:05.79]I don't know.
[99:10.63]How do I, how do you unlock Mewtwo?
[99:14.19]What do I have to do?
[99:15.47]I don't know.
[99:24.15]I need to restock on ammo before I do this.
[99:25.99]Let's get back to home base.
[99:35.41]I need to restock.
[99:39.98]Let's just get up there.
[99:43.14]Mewtwo... I don't... Dude, I don't know.
[99:45.36]Didn't you unlock Mewtwo by letting your console run overnight?
[99:50.21]Didn't you have to have the game running for like 700 hours or something?
[99:53.46]Who was the character that you needed to do that with?
[99:56.98]There was a character that you had to do that with.
[100:05.34]Yeah, there was.
[100:10.67]Was it actually Mewtwo?
[100:14.17]Yeah, it was like Smash 64.
[100:15.53]No, Smash Melee.
[100:16.61]What was it?
[100:19.91]Dude, unlocking some of the characters in melee was a huge pain in the ass.
[100:22.77]It took a lot of time.
[100:23.47]I'm gonna have to scrap.
[100:24.39]I have 82.
[100:24.63]Not enough to do anything.
[100:26.08]Okey-dokey.
[100:26.44]So I wanted to refill before I do this mission because it could be bad.
[100:29.92]I'm gonna take this car.
[100:31.04]The big car.
[100:54.46]Right here.
[100:55.74]Let's stat it.
[100:57.40]More charges?
[100:58.00]Can I do more charges?
[100:58.82]I thought I needed 100.
[101:02.96]Isn't it 100 for more charges?
[101:04.20]I don't know if I lost my mind.
[101:15.40]There were some friends of mine that had melee that didn't... Yeah, it's 150, guys.
[101:19.36]Come on.
[101:19.61]What are you talking about?
[101:25.33]I knew guys that didn't even have half the characters unlocked.
[101:29.45]I look like a fireman?
[101:32.39]I mean, I kind of am.
[101:40.03]I kind of am a fireman.
[101:43.68]Fire and brimstone-man.
[101:50.60]Why are you sitting in the back of the truck?
[101:53.16]Don't you know one small bump could ruin your life?
[101:56.60]What are you thinking?
[101:57.74]This person's going to get hit by a car.
[102:02.19]I thought she was going to run like GTA pedestrian style and get run over.
[102:08.53]Here we go.
[102:08.87]And here we go.
[102:15.59]Thanks to you, we're ready to make our move into dust.
[102:18.65]We're fired.
[102:19.17]Got it.
[102:19.39]What do you mean keep them busy?
[102:21.71]I have to take care of all these road signs?
[102:43.04]Thank you, Luke, the Loot Breaker, for the bits.
[102:45.63]Let me guess.
[102:46.33]Coffee and some chicken-flavored Cheetos.
[102:48.23]Am I right?
[102:49.97]You are right.
[102:51.87]Also, thanks, Luke, again.
[102:52.71]Wait, so you mean I subbed and gave bits to a fake Bostonian, you internet troll.
[102:56.23]Now you have to show us your dental.
[102:59.14]No.
[102:59.64]No dental.
[103:01.60]Thank you, Spritech, for the bits as well.
[103:02.98]I don't see any gorillas here, Jerma.
[103:04.94]Well, we're gorillas.
[103:09.22]Destroy the sensors.
[103:11.92]Well, first of all, this one needs to go.
[103:13.30]Stay inside this truck.
[103:14.86]Destroy the sensors.
[103:15.58]Alright.
[103:15.76]Can I, like, throw shit out the window?
[103:34.89]I can just drive into him.
[103:39.90]This is so easy.
[103:41.14]I just have to drive into him.
[103:48.74]That's just nothing, man.
[103:52.44]This mission became the easiest mission in the game.
[103:56.06]That's three.
[104:01.98]That's four.
[104:04.30]Out, out, out, out, out, out, out.
[104:16.77]That guy's trying to do the same thing as me.
[104:19.31]Why are they all flying around?
[104:20.65]Who is shooting those plasma guns?
[104:33.40]Shit.
[104:34.96]Oh my fucking god.
[104:38.30]What are you people doing?
[104:39.74]You guys are just bugs.
[104:48.94]We're just bugs.
[104:52.98]You serious?
[104:54.54]What the fuck are you people doing?
[105:00.87]I'm gonna lose the mission.
[105:08.67]No, please get me on track.
[105:12.50]Oh my god.
[105:13.34]What are you people doing?
[105:22.08]Why?
[105:22.42]I gotta get out of here.
[105:29.09]I gotta get out of the truck.
[105:44.44]Oh, this game is so good.
[105:50.66]This game is so good.
[105:52.72]Wait, how do I get in the truck?
[105:57.19]Oh my god.
[106:02.55]Oh, please, like, please make another one of these games.
[106:05.41]This is too fucking perfect.
[106:08.01]I'm like, I can't even pay attention.
[106:13.36]What a 10 out of 10 game.
[106:16.73]Like, you think I'm making a joke?
[106:17.75]You think I'm kidding around?
[106:18.61]Like, this is a straight up 10 out of 10.
[106:21.59]I don't think you can make... You can't make a better video game.
[106:24.91]I think I missed one.
[106:26.31]God damn it.
[106:27.15]I feel like... I feel like I missed one back there.
[106:38.23]I'm getting whipped out here!
[106:39.41]And it's gonna happen again.
[106:43.32]I'm gonna have to restart this fucking mission, dude.
[106:48.00]I missed one back here.
[106:49.10]No, I didn't.
[106:51.20]I gotta go... What the fuck?
[106:54.10]It's up there.
[106:54.90]I have to restart it.
[107:00.34]I'm too far back.
[107:01.44]That wasn't my plan.
[107:06.14]I have to, like, curve around the corner here and, like... Wait, what?
[107:12.14]Are those at the very end?
[107:17.81]Whatever.
[107:18.21]I'll go this way.
[107:20.75]It only gets better, I can imagine.
[107:22.67]Is there a train track right there?
[107:34.79]I gotta destroy 12 of these things while being covered by bugs.
[107:39.92]No fucking way.
[107:45.76]That brings us back to here.
[107:47.40]Alright, let's go.
[107:52.33]We're good.
[107:52.83]I actually might be able to do this.
[108:06.59]One to the left of these two and try to wrap around.
[108:13.85]God damn it, I just barely nicked it!
[108:16.11]Did I get it?
[108:16.69]Got it.
[108:17.01]Two more.
[108:26.05]Dude, like, oh fuck, it's this way?
[108:27.79]Okay, yeah, it's two more there.
[108:31.68]Yeah, they're just ground mosquitoes.
[108:34.61]Watch out for the ground mosquitoes.
[108:40.21]Got it.
[108:41.21]Objective complete.
[108:44.84]Let's get the fuck out of here.
[108:47.48]The car broke down.
[108:49.46]Wow!
[108:51.64]Okay, the car literally broke down and is on fire the second I got the last one.
[108:59.68]Parker liberated.
[109:04.77]Yoink.
[109:07.95]Rocket launcher unlocked.
[109:09.41]Visit the upgrade table to purchase.
[109:10.62]Ugh, there's so much cool shit.
[109:12.86]Level 1 armor unlocked.
[109:15.75]This is the upgrade table.
[109:16.65]Sector liberated.
[109:18.29]We did it.
[109:18.51]Am I enjoying Red Faction?
[109:19.99]Oh, man.
[109:20.19]This is great.
[109:20.73]Who made this game?
[109:22.61]Pictures of Spider-Man.
[109:23.73]Am I going to come back and be in this car and have it explode?
[109:44.59]That's what I'm scared of.
[109:45.29]Am I?
[109:48.60]Okay.
[109:49.96]So, at least we're, like, safe enough where I can, like... Okay.
[110:00.64]I figured that could have, like, probably happened.
[110:08.87]Parker liberated!
[110:11.26]Why did you not get out?
[110:12.88]I didn't think it was going to explode that fast.
[110:18.80]I wanted to see if there were still people shooting at me.
[110:21.84]Well, hey, we fast traveled back.
[110:23.32]Now we can do some upgrades.
[110:27.99]Volition made this game.
[110:31.57]People that made Saints Row.
[110:32.95]So, Saints Row...
[110:41.08]Saints Row was interesting and funny and weird.
[110:44.20]But I mean... Where's the other cool shit, Volition?
[110:51.07]What's the last game Volition made?
[110:54.87]THQ.
[110:55.31]Nobody gave THQ shit.
[110:58.96]But really think about it.
[110:59.82]Really think about the games that THQ has actually come out with that were good.
[111:05.62]A lot of them are really fucking fun.
[111:07.72]Like, this is 450.
[111:08.60]I don't have enough.
[111:09.50]I don't have enough for this either.
[111:16.02]You're making agents of mayhem.
[111:20.36]Pollution is dead.
[111:21.20]Alright, so where do I need to go here?
[111:26.08]I need to keep moving, right?
[111:29.17]This is... Oh, wow, we really opened up now.
[111:30.91]Holy crap.
[111:33.81]So we gotta go...
[111:35.99]Over here.
[111:37.93]Let's take a trip.
[111:44.25]Darksiders is made by THQ Nordic.
[111:48.21]What happened, man?
[111:49.19]What happened to THQ?
[111:51.99]They made all those old wrestling games like 2K13, 2K14.
[111:55.17]Those games were fucking gold.
[111:57.62]They were unbelievable.
[111:58.72]And there's somebody riding on the back of the car, so we have to fuck them up.
[112:06.11]That's just the way it is.
[112:08.93]Like, I have to make this an issue for this person.
[112:10.65]I have to.
[112:14.57]Every time.
[112:15.01]Minus three incoming.
[112:17.28]Alright, let's keep on going.
[112:33.48]Destroy the propaganda.
[112:34.38]Actually, that was our propaganda.
[112:38.24]That was, welcome to Parker.
[112:40.86]That wasn't anything bad.
[112:45.81]Was that 90 miles per hour speed limit?
[112:48.15]What kind of fucked up place are we?
[112:52.44]Wait, we're on Mars.
[112:53.60]Let's do it.
[112:55.54]Where is it?
[112:58.01]Right here?
[113:01.83]It's right next to it.
[113:02.57]Might as well give it a go.
[113:03.45]Let's go fuck this guy up.
[113:09.89]You know the addicting factor of a video game?
[113:11.69]When I see one of these red buildings, I have to destroy it.
[113:24.67]That's a hardy building, isn't it?
[113:29.27]This is a hardy fucking building, isn't it?
[113:31.15]Damn.
[113:37.55]That guy?
[113:37.89]Get out of the way.
[113:47.64]What are you doing?
[113:56.31]Just move.
[113:57.73]You just let the guy get away.
[114:00.69]No I didn't.
[114:01.55]Did somebody throw a grenade?
[114:08.06]Alright, let's get some scrap.
[114:16.70]I gotta start picking more scrap up.
[114:23.62]Can you imagine if this was, like, a multiplayer game?
[114:27.00]And when I say multiplayer game, imagine, like, you could, like, collect resources and upgrade buildings and stuff.
[114:31.30]Wait, I'm just explaining, like, every game that's... Another building.
[114:37.79]Ugh, I'm too addicted!
[114:39.71]I'm too addicted to blowing up the buildings!
[114:47.89]Alright, let's take this one out only with the sledgehammer.
[114:50.52]Let's take out the supports and let's do it cool.
[114:53.44]We're going to do this one cool.
[114:55.00]You guys are going to look at this and you're going to say, wow, dude, that was kind of cool.
[114:59.48]Let's get rid of this support.
[115:02.98]Here it goes.
[115:03.89]We're just going to have to push it by a thread.
[115:08.51]We disconnected all the joints.
[115:14.25]Look at how cool that was.
[115:17.65]Oh, that was fucking cool.
[115:27.17]Where am I going?
[115:30.60]Oh shit, oh shit!
[115:36.38]I'm in deep trouble.
[115:37.44]Gotta move, keep moving, keep moving, come on.
[115:40.58]Anybody in this building?
[115:44.32]I can get away with that car, that's a good thing.
[115:45.77]Let me just regen some health and then we're gonna be, this is gonna be cool.
[115:53.22]I'm gonna do the four corners.
[115:55.54]Four corners of the... And we got guys coming up here.
[115:58.04]Oh, fuck.
[116:02.18]And one, two, three.
[116:06.47]Still there.
[116:07.01]Got it.
[116:19.61]Mm-mm.
[116:20.25]Mm-mm.
[116:25.92]Whoa, hey.
[116:29.34]They're throwing grenades over here.
[116:30.90]You're not supposed to be doing that.
[116:34.06]Fuck.
[116:41.89]Ooh.
[116:43.57]Ooh.
[116:44.35]Dude, we're winning.
[116:54.53]We are winning this war.
[117:00.46]Remember your training.
[117:05.90]Whatever this is, I want it.
[117:07.80]Whoops.
[117:09.48]Good guy?
[117:09.97]Good guy.
[117:11.13]Bad guy coming in?
[117:11.91]Bad guy.
[117:17.53]Okay, you suck.
[117:19.19]You are the worst.
[117:21.38]That guy got out and just started screaming.
[117:41.33]Who's driving into people more effective than shooting a minigun?
[117:43.65]Come on, motherfucker.
[117:56.21]Oh, you don't want to be in there.
[118:00.78]Oh, get out.
[118:01.56]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[118:11.70]Come on!
[118:12.46]Pull it down!
[118:13.70]Pull it down!
[118:15.38]Pull it down!
[118:16.94]Oh, man!
[118:19.01]Oh, man!
[118:19.65]We're in enemy territory with no weapons.
[118:23.67]Oh, that was so clutch, dude, and it didn't even work.
[118:25.75]There's an ammo crate over there.
[118:32.18]I gotta be really conservative right now.
[118:42.06]Put that cookie down.
[118:43.28]Alright, we need... Yeah, there's only... Come on, that's nothing.
[118:48.58]Give me more.
[118:55.45]Whoa!
[119:01.83]Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
[119:12.08]Backflip on his own neck.
[119:13.04]Alright, we gotta take out that.
[119:14.52]And then I gotta make my way out of here.
[119:19.10]I gotta get out of here.
[119:20.38]I'm just not prepared.
[119:21.34]I don't have any ammo, no weapons.
[119:31.73]Keep going.
[119:32.15]Just jump up here.
[119:33.89]I gotta go.
[119:34.35]I gotta run.
[119:35.29]There's...
[119:41.60]Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[119:43.78]Oh shit!
[119:48.64]Oh shit!
[119:51.70]Get in!
[119:53.30]Get in!
[119:55.20]Hail Mary!
[119:56.96]We're gonna Hail Mary off the edge here, come on!
[119:58.76]You stupid scooter!
[120:05.41]Go!
[120:06.77]Punch it!
[120:08.25]Punch it!
[120:09.81]Oh, the little engine that could!
[120:11.17]Thomas, the tank engine can do it!
[120:12.57]You can too!
[120:16.05]Yes!
[120:17.48]We did it!
[120:18.90]We did it on our scooter!
[120:23.08]We did some destruction, we did some work, and now we made it.
[120:27.92]Get that alert out of here.
[120:36.72]Let's unlock a new little spot.
[120:39.87]Wherever that... Okay, well there's people shooting at us here.
[120:43.95]Ah, well, I made it.
[120:47.29]Made it to the new little area.
[120:48.77]Oh, shit.
[120:51.13]I'm not gonna go hide somewhere.
[120:55.46]Can I, like, hide behind these rocks?
[120:56.90]I'm stuck in the rocks.
[121:04.99]Okay, well, we're not at green.
[121:06.35]We're at yellow.
[121:07.85]If I sit here, will they go away?
[121:12.49]Maybe.
[121:12.75]They're looking for me right now.
[121:20.22]Almost.
[121:25.40]This game is huge.
[121:26.42]Am I still in the first area?
[121:27.42]No.
[121:28.44]I am in... I am in the second zone.
[121:31.66]Second area, I guess.
[121:34.12]We're good.
[121:37.25]Why didn't anybody tell me this game was so much fun?
[121:38.87]Come on, I've been looking for a game like this, and it was right under my nose.
[121:46.84]This wasn't... It's not green?
[121:50.40]I guess that's like a... I guess that's like an olive.
[121:54.87]It's not necessarily green.
[121:56.03]Well, it's a shade of green.
[121:57.05]Come on.
[122:00.85]I would, but I'm not your friend.
[122:02.15]Hey, that's not true.
[122:05.88]Still looking for me?
[122:16.50]I have fucking melee.
[122:20.02]Where are you?
[122:21.73]How did you guys get in here?
[122:22.61]God damn it.
[122:27.29]Really?
[122:33.48]No, I don't want to blow this place up.
[122:34.58]This is like the home base.
[122:40.42]Okay, well at least it worked.
[122:42.48]At least it worked to my advantage.
[122:49.02]I thought that guy was going to trip on me too.
[122:52.10]Dude, what is it with people in video games and tripping on stuff and dying?
[122:57.74]Nice home alone stream.
[123:00.19]Will you please turn green so I can continue playing the game, please?
[123:06.94]Oh my god, if he tripped over that as well, that would have been YouTube quality.
[123:10.14]Yeah, I know, right?
[123:12.00]That happened in Dark Messiah.
[123:13.24]There was a YouTube quality clip in Dark Messiah.
[123:16.00]Two guys tripped and died, like, over a piece of wood.
[123:17.94]It was pretty funny.
[123:18.56]Alright, we're green.
[123:21.81]Now they're, like, running around in circles.
[123:26.79]If I come out here, is it not gonna be green?
[123:30.09]These guys are all, like, patrolling the area still, even though it's green.
[123:34.21]I swear to god, if I walk around this corner, I'm gonna be very upset.
[123:38.29]Alright, we're good.
[123:38.69]We have to get two guys to trip.
[123:40.57]Mm-hmm.
[123:40.77]You got it.
[124:06.70]Get to the rally point.
[124:09.15]I don't have anything else besides this?
[124:14.89]This like rundown piece of crap?
[124:16.22]I guess I do.
[124:22.16]Do I unlock another area?
[124:26.52]Do I get to actually unlock a, like, safe zone so I don't have to keep going back to Parker?
[124:30.50]I'm assuming you have to.
[124:31.46]And there's a bridge here.
[124:33.34]And you're just giving me an opportunity to blow it up and, like, take it down.
[124:36.19]And I know that's what you're doing.
[124:37.77]And I'm glad you are doing that.
[124:41.21]Like, for instance, this guy.
[124:42.03]Ah, look at this.
[124:43.49]You're just asking for me to drop somebody off that bridge.
[124:45.39]I'm on my way.
[124:55.01]Kill the EDF at the rally.
[124:56.09]What, we can't have a peaceful protest?
[124:58.87]What's up with that?
[125:16.78]No protesting, apparently, when the EDF is around.
[125:26.05]He's dead.
[125:28.41]He's not dead.
[125:29.23]This guy's still fucking alive.
[125:32.98]Now he's dead.
[125:33.64]I heard like a hundred bones crying.
[125:35.26]That guy's not alive.
[125:36.68]He's dead.
[125:41.36]This guy's trying to get away.
[125:45.44]Oh, come on.
[125:48.94]I could have launched him off the edge.
[125:53.17]You are a pesky little shit.
[125:58.79]Who are you throwing a grenade at, dude?
[126:02.11]What are you doing?
[126:05.85]Why are you... Oh, shit.
[126:11.00]Alright, let's go destroy the PA system.
[126:14.30]PA sy- Go, go, go!
[126:18.26]That didn't destroy the PA system!
[126:34.48]Get it!
[126:35.56]Get, get it!
[126:37.34]Get this stupid thing to fall!
[126:49.50]But I wish I could just whistle and have like a car come.
[126:54.60]Plus three, we're good.
[127:00.12]Alright, I need to accommodate this vehicle.
[127:01.40]I need to accommodate- you idiot.
[127:03.42]I need to accommodate that vehicle.
[127:04.68]Where are you going?
[127:08.04]Give me this car!
[127:09.46]Get out.
[127:11.14]You're smart.
[127:11.80]Thank God you're not an idiot.
[127:20.77]At least I have armor again.
[127:24.55]Get up there!
[127:25.40]Punch it!
[127:26.68]Punch it!
[127:28.12]Punch it, you fool!
[127:34.86]Oh, come on.
[127:39.94]Get up there.
[127:41.50]Get up there.
[127:42.56]I'm the guy in charge.
[127:43.50]I'm the Freemason.
[127:46.50]I need to free you.
[127:49.88]Here we are.
[127:51.62]This is why I didn't want to get out of the car, guys.
[127:53.12]Look at how many people are standing right here.
[127:55.76]There's like 40 guys right here.
[127:58.40]We're going straight into the building.
[128:04.00]That's how you fucking get it done.
[128:06.24]That's how you destroy a PA system.
[128:08.42]I didn't, I did, the PA system's not destroyed.
[128:10.58]God damn it.
[128:16.55]Come on, that would have been so awesome.
[128:22.89]That's it.
[128:24.05]There it goes.
[128:25.27]Watch out, people.
[128:26.93]Scrap.
[128:27.19]Let me know when the scrap button gets on.
[128:30.49]No scrap anywhere?
[128:31.11]The PA system is fully functional.
[128:37.78]Okay, great.
[128:38.54]I just got pranked.
[128:42.98]It's alright.
[128:43.82]As long as I can make it around, everything will be fine.
[128:51.25]right through this one right here don't you dare don't do it something exploded something exploded something exploded so many people oh shit
[129:21.65]Oh my god!
[129:23.41]How am I still alive?
[129:24.55]I don't know.
[129:24.99]There's so many explosive barrels everywhere.
[129:27.73]One of my gorillas died.
[129:30.49]It's alright, there's only one more up here.
[129:37.19]Last one is up there.
[129:40.00]Let's get in here and we're gonna drive straight into it.
[129:45.68]Close that lid.
[129:46.70]Somebody could easily throw a grenade in there.
[129:50.23]Move, move, I don't want to hurt anybody.
[129:52.31]Alright, where is this thing?
[129:56.72]On top?
[129:57.02]It's right there.
[130:04.70]We're just gonna ram this fucking thing until it's gone.
[130:11.18]God damn it, come on, get rid of it.
[130:14.18]Alright, well we have to get out.
[130:20.27]Oh, fuck.
[130:23.51]God damn it, I knocked a light post over.
[130:25.31]Wait, there's still... There's still enough time.
[130:30.23]I got enough time still.
[130:32.98]No, get off the fucking console.
[130:39.56]Game over, I win.
[130:41.24]Collect the scrap.
[130:53.05]Kill Captain Gunnerson?
[130:54.35]I gotta kill Captain Gunnerson now?
[131:00.09]Who the fuck is Captain Gunnerson?
[131:08.08]What a fake name that is, too.
[131:09.74]Alright, we gotta... Where are you going?
[131:12.68]Get out.
[131:15.86]Don't let that son of a gun go.
[131:30.47]Got him.
[131:35.37]I don't know why everyone's still working.
[131:42.30]Everyone's still going about their daily business.
[131:44.48]It's like, what are you people doing?
[131:45.44]Is that him?
[131:52.06]No, he's up here.
[131:54.50]Is he trying to get away?
[131:55.26]Is that what I'm understanding here?
[131:57.15]This dude's like trying to flee.
[132:03.72]There he is.
[132:04.96]There's Captain Gunnarsson.
[132:07.93]Oh, dude.
[132:10.45]Oh, no.
[132:12.31]Oh, no.
[132:13.57]No.
[132:15.43]No.
[132:20.38]Where am I?
[132:22.84]I made it.
[132:23.26]Okay.
[132:23.84]Captain Gunnarsson.
[132:25.52]That's loud as hell.
[132:26.50]I'm going to take this down while I have a chance.
[132:31.31]Wait, he got away!
[132:32.11]Wait!
[132:32.71]What?
[132:36.03]Shit!
[132:39.91]Oh shit!
[132:41.27]No!
[132:45.96]God damn it!
[132:50.94]Oh my god!
[132:54.58]I got like stuck by a fucking- I got like wedged into the- Oh, that sucks!
[132:59.86]I got wedged in and I couldn't get out of the fucking car.
[133:04.65]Oh, give me a break.
[133:07.01]I drove in there and got wedged in and couldn't leave my vehicle.
[133:12.93]Oh my fucking god, that's so annoying.
[133:15.27]I just, I got sardine canned into the corner and I couldn't... No, I broke this car.
[133:29.66]I'm on my way.
[133:30.78]God damn it.
[133:35.78]And I didn't know he was going to drive away.
[133:38.17]Oh, this is annoying.
[133:40.21]I did it so well last time, too.
[133:42.35]I did such a good fucking job.
[133:43.59]I'm actually angry about that shit.
[133:47.19]Oh, look at this.
[133:48.43]I'm just... I'm so fucking just tilted about that.
[134:00.72]I'm so fucking on tilt right now.
[134:06.33]I don't want this stupid car.
[134:10.05]I can't believe it.
[134:11.41]That was like a 20 minute mission.
[134:13.28]And I get stuck in a corner and I can't get out of the car.
[134:18.50]And then finally I glitch out of the car.
[134:20.72]And the guy gets away.
[134:23.53]What a load of dog shit.
[134:27.34]I don't know why I keep going for that dumb car.
[134:35.22]Dammit!
[134:35.92]Dammit!
[134:36.36]Dammit!
[134:36.78]Dammit!
[134:37.18]Dammit!
[134:39.44]Almost there.
[134:42.51]Alright, just get it done.
[134:43.87]Don't be like, angry.
[134:45.29]Just get it fucking done.
[134:49.41]Goddammit!
[134:52.15]No!
[134:56.56]No, I didn't mean it.
[135:00.97]I'm just so angry.
[135:03.57]I just can't do it.
[135:04.67]I'm on complete fucking... Somebody shook the coin machine and we're on tilt.
[135:11.69]I've lost control.
[135:18.32]Slow it down.
[135:18.90]I'm in full panic mode right now.
[135:28.06]Break his fucking neck.
[135:29.66]Do it.
[135:30.92]Make it nice and clean.
[135:32.96]Two more guys.
[135:36.36]Where?
[135:37.00]Alright.
[135:38.32]Destroy the speakers.
[135:42.18]Here we go.
[135:42.71]Make it clean.
[135:43.33]There's one.
[135:51.29]No.
[135:51.49]Don't get in that.
[135:55.43]Give me this thing.
[135:56.39]Give it to me.
[135:57.32]Give me this car.
[136:07.94]We just gotta drive around the outskirts.
[136:09.30]Fuck that guy, he's an idiot.
[136:21.65]Here we go, here we go.
[136:22.53]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[136:23.57]Right into it.
[136:24.07]Right into it.
[136:24.73]Blow it up.
[136:36.34]That dumb thing is still... Yeah, I'm just panicking.
[136:42.28]Stop panicking.
[136:46.89]My fucking charge bounced off.
[136:50.61]Okay, stop panicking.
[136:52.47]Easy.
[136:52.95]I need another car.
[137:06.15]Okay, there's a car back there, but it's alright.
[137:08.45]I just gotta get this.
[137:10.39]Good guy car?
[137:11.23]Bad guy car?
[137:12.59]A couple of good guy cars.
[137:15.37]You stupid bitch!
[137:16.72]What do you think?
[137:18.78]What are you thinking?
[137:20.42]What are you thinking?
[137:22.30]If I just died right there, I would've had a meltdown.
[137:29.32]There it goes.
[137:39.81]Move.
[137:44.73]Hey, my mummy is listening.
[137:49.49]One more, and then we gotta go capture the bad guy.
[137:53.07]Let's be on the road with a car that's not a piece of shit.
[137:58.48]That would be wonderful, Mr. Jeremy.
[138:04.24]You idiots!
[138:11.61]You idiots!
[138:13.69]Stop doing this!
[138:15.37]Stop hitting me!
[138:16.89]Get me in the buggy!
[138:18.35]Stop fucking hitting your master!
[138:21.31]You fucking dumb people!
[138:23.71]You can't keep doing that to me!
[138:25.90]Oh!
[138:30.59]Just walking in my way.
[138:32.89]Alright, don't fuck this up.
[138:35.60]I have plenty of charges.
[138:37.30]I just got to get over here and then tail him and then kill him.
[138:40.44]Get out of the way.
[138:41.86]Can I save it right here?
[138:47.53]I can't.
[138:48.15]You can't save scum in these missions.
[138:49.55]Alright, easy, easy.
[138:53.11]He's right here.
[138:55.10]Plenty of time.
[138:55.78]There he is.
[138:57.20]He's driving backwards.
[138:58.62]He's gonna drive into me.
[139:03.82]No, don't you dare!
[139:08.19]Don't you fucking dare!
[139:10.73]Get me in the machine!
[139:12.83]Get in this!
[139:13.29]I don't know what it is!
[139:14.09]Get in quick!
[139:16.15]Go, go, go, go!
[139:18.25]Go, go, go!
[139:19.73]Go, go, go!
[139:21.05]Go in the giant slab of tile.
[139:23.01]Don't let him get away.
[139:26.32]I can't get away.
[139:28.66]I got it.
[139:29.06]This thing is such a sloppy car.
[139:31.04]It's too sloppy.
[139:33.23]Run him over!
[139:34.99]There he is.
[139:47.87]He's not dead.
[139:50.37]No!
[139:50.83]Well done.
[139:53.17]These workers have learned an important lesson today.
[139:56.09]The Red Faction is here to fight for you.
[139:58.69]Let's stop it.
[139:59.71]Together, we'll drive these butchers off our planet.
[140:07.45]That was too much, man.
[140:08.45]That was intense.
[140:13.21]Okay.
[140:18.03]Heart-bounding comedy.
[140:23.95]I'm gonna move it.
[140:37.47]I love it.
[140:37.97]I swing it and I hurt myself.
[140:43.12]That's so stupid.
[140:47.10]I'm just peeling the car off one by one.
[140:49.14]Now she's driving like a Model T.
[140:58.32]Now we should- Oh, great.
[141:01.66]You don't know your own strength.
[141:02.80]Alright, well that's my reward for beating that mission.
[141:05.30]Time to go.
[141:06.46]There's ore over here too.
[141:10.28]There's a lot of ore.
[141:15.38]What do I need for the rocket launcher?
[141:19.53]This game is fucking fun, man.
[141:20.97]This is a great game.
[141:22.57]I don't know how many times I'm gonna have to say this, but like...
[141:27.15]I'm like, I'm having a blast right now.
[141:30.85]Alright, good.
[141:36.85]Look at these fucking idiots.
[141:39.50]Nobody in this car.
[141:40.32]Well, whatever.
[141:40.80]I need this one.
[141:41.32]Haha, fun video game.
[141:56.97]I'm gonna do this right now, because it's... What is this?
[142:01.15]Yeah, we'll do this.
[142:01.77]I'm right here.
[142:03.91]Close enough.
[142:07.00]Don't ruin the experience by playing the second one.
[142:11.20]So wait, the second one really is that bad, huh?
[142:16.41]That was the guy!
[142:17.25]That was the guy!
[142:19.09]Follow the courier to his destination.
[142:21.61]Track the courier and stop him before he delivers his information.
[142:24.66]Once the courier is dead, collect the data and get the alert level to green to complete your objective.
[142:29.08]Okay.
[142:31.62]Well, this thing's going to explode.
[142:33.80]And interestingly enough, this is going to blow up.
[142:40.77]And he got away.
[142:41.83]No, I didn't even know that's what I had to do.
[142:48.65]Now we're back down here.
[142:51.19]Brilliant.
[142:59.04]Every man for himself.
[143:02.12]Every man for himself.
[143:06.12]Second one isn't that bad.
[143:07.02]It's nothing like this one.
[143:07.77]It's a huge disappointment.
[143:08.73]That's too bad.
[143:09.29]Is this a bad guy?
[143:13.47]What the hell are you doing in here?
[143:16.53]This is like a safe house.
[143:17.41]This is our safe house.
[143:25.80]First Red Faction.
[143:26.60]Okay, so this is what I don't understand.
[143:28.98]So somebody explain this to me.
[143:31.30]Red Faction was a first-person shooter that was kind of... Wasn't it just like a mediocre first-person shooter?
[143:39.63]I think I remember playing that game or seeing somebody play it.
[143:43.19]And it was nothing like this.
[143:47.38]That's why I never gave any of the sequels a look at all, because I remember the first two games or something was like a weird FPS.
[143:53.33]Where am I?
[144:00.13]This is the safe house.
[144:00.99]I need to get a safe house, man.
[144:05.31]What's with the... This is moving around like crazy.
[144:10.15]A house arrest.
[144:10.96]Rescue captured.
[144:11.70]Let's just do it.
[144:12.32]I'm in right here.
[144:16.59]Red Faction 1 is amazing.
[144:19.54]I guess I just don't remember.
[144:21.06]I just thought it was like a mediocre FPS.
[144:24.22]I never really gave it like much thought.
[144:28.62]Oh yeah!
[144:30.20]That sounds like a great game to play.
[144:35.31]Red Faction 1 was a boring shooter.
[144:36.85]Red Faction 2 was a slightly less boring shooter.
[144:40.07]Red Faction 4 Armageddon is awful.
[144:42.09]The entire game takes place in caves.
[144:46.20]Yeah, I can only, like, imagine.
[144:48.12]Like, I don't know.
[144:51.36]So they just made this game and they were like, well, that was really fun and cool ideas and stuff.
[144:55.30]And then that's it.
[144:58.20]What is this thing saying to me?
[145:01.68]What the hell is this?
[145:04.78]What on Earth?
[145:10.82]Convoy, destroy the convoy.
[145:11.86]That's way out of my way.
[145:15.68]The magnet gun was fun.
[145:16.61]Alright, let me... I gotta figure out something to do right now.
[145:24.47]Is there a way to drag the map around without it ripping around like crazy like this?
[145:28.91]I feel like if I even barely touch it, it shoots around.
[145:31.39]I guess you can click to move.
[145:33.32]Let's do this one.
[145:42.46]You get really cool unique weapons to get like a gravity gun.
[145:44.78]What is this guy walking to?
[145:52.80]Don't hit him with the car.
[145:56.02]No, what?
[145:58.10]Hello?
[145:58.72]Kelly Gunnarsson hasn't helped.
[146:00.48]EDF troops are holding hostages at the bottom of the pit.
[146:03.24]And they'll kill him if you don't hurry.
[146:05.28]Throat clearing stream?
[146:06.28]I mean, I do have an issue with that like lately.
[146:13.09]I do have a throat clearing issue lately.
[146:15.65]Sorry about that.
[146:18.24]Sorry about that!
[146:19.24]Bottom of the pit.
[146:23.22]You got it.
[146:26.32]Hostage is in this house.
[146:27.46]There he is.
[146:38.95]I can't go that far, because I don't want to kill another.
[146:45.63]This guy's just like sitting there.
[146:47.99]Did you seriously just do that?
[146:53.00]What the fuck, man?
[146:56.02]What are you thinking?
[146:56.76]He just threw a grenade at his own friends and killed the hostage, but nobody else died, apparently.
[147:15.23]I like the shooting, too.
[147:15.91]The shooting in the game is fun.
[147:20.60]It has a good shoot feel to it.
[147:22.26]I'm almost out of ammo.
[147:27.30]I don't even... Okay.
[147:29.70]That guy was spring-loaded.
[147:30.65]That guy's internal organs were spring-loaded.
[147:34.59]What else we got?
[147:35.13]Oh, there are more people in here.
[147:43.38]Uh, I think there's two people in here?
[147:45.34]Oh, there's one.
[147:51.02]I'm in the house.
[147:51.94]Helping you.
[147:52.60]Get a gun.
[147:53.90]Pick up a gun and make your way into the car, please.
[147:56.43]There's still... No, that's... You're the only one left.
[147:58.61]That's fine.
[147:59.23]Just get in.
[148:06.21]Actually, though, I want to destroy this weird thing over here.
[148:08.73]Because it's an owned... It's an owned unit.
[148:14.80]Don't go over there.
[148:19.67]Get in.
[148:19.89]Let's drive over that and pick up all the stuff.
[148:23.35]Get in.
[148:29.37]Okay, I picked up at least a little bit.
[148:31.41]I'm okay with that.
[148:36.11]Oh, shit.
[148:36.89]Get out.
[148:37.73]Get out.
[148:38.03]New car.
[148:39.25]Get out.
[148:42.49]Whoa!
[148:44.39]Don't die.
[148:44.95]Don't die.
[148:45.29]We need a new car.
[148:45.91]This car.
[148:46.35]Alright, get in.
[148:53.19]Make it in.
[148:56.17]Alright, we're good.
[148:58.49]Oh, Jesus.
[148:59.07]This turn is so tight.
[149:01.22]This turn is not... It wasn't made for beetles like me to get up this.
[149:06.36]How slow do you have to be to get out of this complex?
[149:09.20]For real.
[149:12.75]Doesn't this take place in like fucking 2035?
[149:15.73]Tell me tanks can't go faster than this.
[149:17.25]Liberated.
[149:32.02]Did I get credit for that?
[149:33.70]I still need to destroy it.
[149:34.98]I don't want to get out of the car though.
[149:37.27]I am going to get out of the car.
[149:53.22]No, I would pick up the scrap that came out of there, but I don't want this to just get exploded.
[150:02.58]Wait, I gotta take them all the way back to the safe house?
[150:06.81]Am I gonna take him all the way back to Parker?
[150:09.43]Is that really what's happening here?
[150:15.99]I gotta drive to the other country?
[150:19.72]Holy God.
[150:23.64]That's fun.
[150:24.26]There's a closer safe house.
[150:31.06]Is there?
[150:31.56]Where is it?
[150:33.02]Holy shit, we're going all the way up here.
[150:36.66]Well, that's fine.
[150:38.92]We're not going to park, but we're going up.
[150:40.80]With our smoking car that is inches away from being on fire.
[150:47.28]Like a quarter of an inch of this thing's gonna be burning.
[150:55.46]Some scrap over here.
[150:56.18]Gonna come out here and whack that with a hammer.
[151:05.12]And... hello.
[151:08.01]Dust safe house.
[151:11.13]Completed.
[151:12.89]Five girdle actions.
[151:13.93]Complete.
[151:16.01]Unlocked proximity mines.
[151:17.13]This is the upgrade, so that's kind of cool.
[151:19.98]Proximity mines are never my thing, though.
[151:22.94]Because remote detonation, I can determine when I'm going to blow it up.
[151:27.80]Which is more interesting to me than anything else.
[151:32.87]Alright.
[151:34.35]Uh...
[151:41.09]Jeremy, I really enjoy watching this.
[151:43.01]Well, that's good, because I really enjoy playing this.
[151:46.22]So, expect absolutely for this to be played tomorrow.
[151:52.24]Not tomorrow, on Tuesday.
[151:55.10]We are going to play through until I'm bored, and who knows how long that's going to take.
[152:00.41]It might not happen.
[152:01.59]I might want to play this whole game.
[152:08.36]I really enjoy watching you watch this.
[152:12.54]Red Dead Redemption.
[152:14.32]I beat the whole thing.
[152:17.10]I beat all of Red Dead Redemption and the DLC.
[152:18.88]What's going on?
[152:23.52]Never going to play this again?
[152:24.26]That is not true.
[152:24.98]I am very much happy and having fun with this game.
[152:27.66]Alright, I got 418.
[152:28.24]How much do I need for the proximity mines at 250?
[152:31.80]Level 1 armor.
[152:39.70]Alright.
[152:40.32]Alright.
[152:40.88]Shatters.
[152:46.74]Should I save up and get the rocket launcher or is that just a waste of salvage?
[152:55.39]Because salvage comes but it doesn't come that readily.
[153:01.25]Here's the damage you can take.
[153:02.35]Armor.
[153:03.81]We don't get our shiny weapon though.
[153:08.30]Alright, we'll be safe.
[153:09.12]Let's get armor.
[153:10.72]Man, I would do ammo, but I can't.
[153:14.13]No, I need ammo for this.
[153:15.71]Bad.
[153:18.13]Remote charge count.
[153:21.43]The next thing I'm going to do is charge your increases.
[153:23.56]Because I feel like I'm running out of these.
[153:32.25]I'll take the armor though, that's for sure.
[153:34.95]What the fuck was that?
[153:36.44]Oh, Jesus.
[153:37.10]Uh, let's go... Can I get up there?
[153:39.02]I don't think I can.
[153:39.56]Yeah, I can.
[153:51.36]Hey, I can do it.
[153:53.02]So what's the benefit of smashing these ore deposits?
[153:59.45]If I break enough of these, am I going to unlock another item?
[154:03.51]That's what it seems like a lot of the stuff in the game is tied to.
[154:07.59]You complete random tasks and you unlock the random stuff.
[154:19.49]Get scrap.
[154:20.67]It's just a source of scrap.
[154:21.69]So it's not like, oh, destroy 50 of these and you get... Like, unlock something.
[154:27.92]Is it going to kill me?
[154:31.38]I feel like it might, so I'm going to save.
[154:33.16]And I'm too lazy to walk all the way down.
[154:40.18]Nope, I'm fine.
[154:42.59]It's just a good amount of scrap.
[154:43.87]Okay.
[154:45.85]Real clear.
[154:48.16]Okay, what's next?
[154:53.64]Ore is probably the best way to get money.
[154:57.31]What are all these?
[154:59.55]Guerrilla action.
[155:00.19]Help the red faction by completing the objectives.
[155:04.61]Hostage rescue.
[155:05.55]There's the mission up there.
[155:06.51]Alright, we're going to go hostage rescue and then we're going to do the mission up here.
[155:13.37]Actually, that is a lot of health.
[155:16.63]I'll get rid of that.
[155:17.15]Give me one of these buggies.
[155:22.65]You just get a good amount of scrap?
[155:23.67]Okay.
[155:24.09]That's cool.
[155:25.48]What about these, like, junk piles?
[155:27.24]I need to be doing that, right?
[155:29.70]Don't I need to be doing this shit?
[155:31.96]Like, the very beginning tutorial is like, break stuff!
[155:35.22]Yeah, of course.
[155:40.04]Always listen to the very beginning tutorial.
[155:43.83]Break a bunch of random shit.
[155:45.34]It's crap.
[155:51.38]Okay, you guys, you can tell that I like a game when I start to do stuff like this.
[155:59.63]What are the chances of me saving all the hostages?
[156:05.74]Uh, zero percent chance.
[156:12.27]Once I start caring about... I gotta make sure I collect as much scrap as I can.
[156:16.19]That's how you can tell the game has like piqued my interest very much so.
[156:23.24]Nothing else in there?
[156:27.20]Swinging animation is really good too.
[156:29.26]I like it.
[156:30.40]I like it a lot.
[156:32.29]But he didn't notice.
[156:34.45]What did I... What happened?
[156:38.47]What did I... What happened?
[156:39.97]Why is everybody freaking out?
[156:45.32]Did I miss something?
[156:49.96]Marauder?
[156:55.93]I didn't even hear anything.
[156:59.77]I'm just collecting scrap.
[157:00.71]Let me just play my World of Warcraft game.
[157:14.84]There was a marauder audio clip playing.
[157:16.80]Hold on, they have like super mutants in this game or something?
[157:20.30]Is that what I'm hearing?
[157:21.22]Going against the super mutant.
[157:37.13]Here we go.
[157:39.29]There's a structure up there.
[157:42.64]destroy and an ore facility and a box oh it's so fun to hit things it just is look look at how much fun that was I can't go look I can't go to home depot and go do that in one of the aisles I can do it here there's my orc
[158:22.59]I think I didn't even care.
[158:29.19]Facecam where you don't have good dental.
[158:30.89]What's with the dental thing?
[158:33.07]What are you guys talking about?
[158:37.92]I missed some bits.
[158:39.72]I see I'm so interested in this game that I'm not even paying attention to anything else.
[158:43.54]I'm like looking at the chat sometimes.
[158:45.18]I'm having fun hitting stuff with a fucking hammer.
[158:47.46]Let's be real.
[158:47.96]Luke.
[158:49.46]Luke.
[158:52.11]Luke the Loot Breaker, thanks for the $1.
[158:53.53]Jeremiah, I had to buy these bits to tell you you missed my bits just before you took a break to go get coffee.
[158:59.73]Well, use those bits to tell me about the bits that I didn't get, and the bits.
[159:03.25]And then put those bits in my pocket, and then I'll tell you about the bits.
[159:06.85]Let's take this thing down.
[159:07.91]Timber.
[159:19.64]Ah!
[159:21.38]What stress relief.
[159:23.50]I'm so glad that didn't fall this way.
[159:27.18]That would have been a disaster.
[159:30.23]Gotta go to the wind farm.
[159:30.97]Get the hostages.
[159:31.63]Straight ahead.
[159:51.45]Idiot!
[159:51.61]That's what I thought he said.
[159:59.73]And... Let's try to get both of them.
[160:02.33]So I'm not going to do anything really that stupid.
[160:05.01]I want to free the hostages... ...from the wind farm.
[160:15.90]Alright, let's make this as clean as we can.
[160:22.30]Fucking clean.
[160:23.16]Cleaned it up.
[160:55.89]Let's go, guys.
[160:56.35]Got a gun.
[160:58.39]There's one guy left over here.
[161:00.69]Just be careful when you're on your way out.
[161:02.63]This guy right here.
[161:03.39]Is everybody even in there?
[161:04.43]He's right there.
[161:20.99]Oh, we gotta go.
[161:21.97]Come on.
[161:23.15]I'll get a shortcut, shortcut, shortcut.
[161:24.57]Come on.
[161:24.97]Through down here.
[161:25.39]Down here.
[161:25.77]Come on.
[161:26.13]Let's go.
[161:26.54]Let's go.
[161:27.86]Go.
[161:28.78]Go.
[161:29.26]No.
[161:29.56]Stupid.
[161:30.54]Idiot.
[161:32.16]Idiot.
[161:33.62]Surrounded by idiots.
[161:40.50]Surrounded by idiots.
[161:41.70]And you're running up there.
[161:43.05]Don't be a hero.
[161:56.51]Get in the car!
[162:06.46]Get in the car!
[162:10.50]Get in!
[162:11.66]Get in!
[162:12.16]Where is he?
[162:12.82]Get in the car!
[162:13.98]Get in!
[162:14.94]Get in the car!
[162:30.52]What is happening?
[162:33.20]Get us out of here!
[162:41.23]Get us out, quick!
[162:43.75]First I'm gonna get some of this mining material.
[162:54.92]What the fuck, man?
[162:55.96]This game is perfect.
[162:58.59]I don't think I'll ever play another game that's as good as this one.
[163:01.65]I'm not sure about that.
[163:03.91]I'm not so sure.
[163:07.67]We need to get a car.
[163:10.28]Is that a car?
[163:11.36]That is a car and it's coming in real hot.
[163:13.34]Oh my fucking god.
[163:24.57]Please stop please stop it.
[163:26.71]Alright, fuck you buddy.
[163:29.08]Give me this Holy shit
[163:48.22]That was close to what you could say is carnage.
[164:02.28]Perfect game.
[164:03.95]I never thought I was going to find another game in my life that I would be like, well, that game's perfect.
[164:09.65]It's possible.
[164:10.35]It's possible I may have found it.
[164:17.18]This is a perfect video game.
[164:26.85]I will argue that to anybody that wants to argue.
[164:29.91]This has the insane dumb shit from GTA mixed with destructible entire environments from Battlefield and moron AI.
[164:40.85]The case in point.
[164:42.82]Right there.
[164:44.00]It has GTA pedestrian AI.
[164:47.14]Perfect fucking game.
[164:54.21]You don't get any better than that.
[164:55.35]Alright, let me try to... Let's try to make this fucking clean.
[165:06.82]We need to get everybody in that garbage truck.
[165:10.94]Like, quickly, before all this goes to shit.
[165:16.10]Somebody's gonna fucking die.
[165:17.22]Okay.
[165:20.24]There we are.
[165:20.88]Here comes the whole entire crew.
[165:22.52]I'm fucking dead.
[165:26.56]God damn it.
[165:34.81]No!
[165:36.21]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[165:37.09]That was a mistake.
[165:37.63]I didn't mean to do that.
[165:38.37]We gotta reload.
[165:46.04]What was it?
[165:46.38]Two on this one?
[165:51.62]Okay.
[165:52.58]We're gonna get this.
[165:54.84]Oh my god.
[165:56.78]Can they all fit in the garbage truck?
[165:57.96]I'm driving straight into the house.
[166:04.83]That was a home run.
[166:05.61]That was a cricket match.
[166:09.89]I buried her into the ground so far.
[166:11.43]That was a tennis ball.
[166:12.49]She turned into a fucking tennis ball.
[166:16.29]Alright, they'll fit in here.
[166:17.11]Well, I'm driving straight in.
[166:20.57]I have to.
[166:21.11]I have to cause some kind of mayhem.
[166:28.08]Went up with the wind tunnels.
[166:30.96]That's fine.
[166:35.30]I'm going to get a straight shot.
[166:38.70]Turn here.
[166:40.38]Fast, straight shot right through the front of the building.
[166:44.67]Here we are.
[166:51.84]Alright, I'm here for the hostages.
[167:02.43]Is that right?
[167:02.85]One more?
[167:03.15]How many fucking times you gotta shoot a goddamn guy in the face?
[167:12.25]Let's go.
[167:14.03]Backed up right in the perfect spot.
[167:15.29]Two guys, clean.
[167:16.95]You're still here, but it's okay, you're dead.
[167:21.64]Into the car.
[167:23.72]Let's go.
[167:24.92]Before everyone gets here.
[167:26.18]You get in the passenger, you get in the back.
[167:28.70]You are in.
[167:29.22]Where's the other one?
[167:30.36]Are you in?
[167:32.28]Get in.
[167:33.68]Get in the car.
[167:35.40]Get in the car.
[167:37.82]Get in.
[167:39.51]Get in before it gets insane.
[167:41.15]Get in the car.
[167:43.35]Get inside of this car.
[167:46.67]Oh my god, you idiot.
[167:48.19]Please get in the car.
[167:50.37]You're not going to make me fail this.
[167:53.49]Get in.
[167:54.91]Get in the car.
[167:57.29]Stop shooting at the enemy.
[167:58.51]Please get in.
[167:59.07]What do you mean there's no space?
[168:01.45]How could there be no space?
[168:05.85]No, it's got... We've got to leave her.
[168:09.49]I've got to leave her.
[168:12.81]Goodbye.
[168:17.19]She's dead.
[168:17.73]I don't even care.
[168:19.83]She can't get in the back of the garbage truck.
[168:23.25]She cannot get in the back of the truck.
[168:25.88]What is this fucking roadblock?
[168:32.64]Tell me she can't get in the back.
[168:36.04]Oh no.
[168:36.82]And I can't shoot out the window either.
[168:42.40]That was such dog shit.
[168:44.34]It's full of garbage?
[168:45.02]Well sit back there.
[168:46.98]Lean on the old dirty diaperism.
[168:48.28]What's the worst that's gonna happen?
[168:51.64]Game no longer perfect.
[168:52.85]No, game's still perfect.
[168:58.99]The game is still perfect, guys.
[169:01.05]I'm sorry.
[169:01.47]Like, it don't matter.
[169:02.39]Funny shot.
[169:03.01]It's okay.
[169:03.49]I'll remember that for next time.
[169:04.37]What do I got for scrap?
[169:10.75]I have 332.
[169:16.55]I can get the arc welder.
[169:21.26]I really want that, though.
[169:22.26]I don't know if I want the arc welder right now.
[169:23.70]Will you shoot me in the face?
[169:27.14]Alright, where are we going here?
[169:27.94]I'm gonna say... Let's go down here.
[169:30.78]Let's destroy this stuff.
[169:44.86]I should go to my broom closet and get some ammo.
[169:47.18]Do you know how good this game actually was?
[169:51.45]Honest to God, man.
[169:53.73]I'm so happily surprised at how fun this is.
[169:56.77]Lightbearer2077, thanks for the 30 bucks.
[170:00.29]10 out of 10.
[170:01.38]Quality stream.
[170:02.20]Wicked hard not to piss myself.
[170:04.22]But for God's sake, save the friggin' hostages.
[170:08.58]I tried.
[170:09.14]I was trying.
[170:11.48]She wouldn't get in the garbage car.
[170:13.58]But thanks a lot, Lightbearer.
[170:15.16]30 bucks.
[170:15.96]Very kind of you.
[170:16.96]Thank you so much.
[170:20.74]There we go.
[170:21.84]That truck has machine guns now.
[170:30.89]I already got it on the waypoint.
[170:32.27]It does have machine guns.
[170:34.27]Damn.
[170:34.79]How do I use them?
[170:35.41]Oh!
[170:35.69]Oh!
[170:42.10]This game just turned into Twisted Metal.
[170:46.70]That's so cool.
[170:52.26]Alright, let's go liberate.
[170:53.48]Nice clean machine guns.
[170:57.40]Whoops, sorry.
[170:59.40]Whoa!
[171:05.35]Play Twisted Metal on stream?
[171:06.43]Didn't they make a new one not that long ago?
[171:11.60]Four or five years ago, wasn't there a new one?
[171:13.87]And excuse me!
[171:16.47]That is a concentration of ore we're not gonna ignore.
[171:20.23]Sorry.
[171:21.03]There's way too many up there for me to not go get it.
[171:24.21]Out of the car.
[171:31.29]There's so many here.
[171:48.11]What the fuck is this thing?
[171:52.24]What are they like fucking aliens?
[171:57.08]What are these fucking aliens?
[171:59.13]What the fuck is happening right now?
[172:15.84]EDF is sending reinforcements to Parker.
[172:17.98]Stop that convoy before they get there.
[172:19.34]Fuck Parker.
[172:19.90]Send reinforcements to me.
[172:23.20]There's like three guys.
[172:24.03]I'm trying to lure them over here.
[172:25.47]Oh, shit.
[172:26.01]Are we on the same team now?
[172:29.19]We are.
[172:29.47]We're like on the same team.
[172:32.07]Everybody hates the aliens.
[172:33.33]This is crazy.
[172:42.48]I had to do that because I needed to fucking...
[172:49.09]Where'd they go?
[172:49.69]Up here?
[172:50.91]I have to kill this guy.
[172:54.89]Got him.
[172:56.36]What'd he drop?
[172:56.70]Did he drop something?
[172:57.72]Where's that, like, magic wand he had?
[172:59.38]Okay, he didn't have anything.
[173:08.54]That was kind of ridiculous.
[173:10.96]I got, like, crept up upon by those guys.
[173:15.79]And he didn't drop anything.
[173:21.46]Yeah, the guy had a magic wand in his hand.
[173:23.64]He had like a lightning staff, like a Warcraft staff.
[173:25.89]Did I blow it up?
[173:29.61]Man, will you guys seriously just fuck off?
[173:38.08]Really?
[173:38.36]Like, are we doing this right now?
[173:41.92]I have shit to do.
[173:43.68]Get out of here.
[173:48.87]I got things to do.
[173:49.89]I don't have time for this.
[173:51.53]I lost the magic wand.
[173:54.11]Could have been like a... I could have casted like magician spells and stuff.
[174:02.76]That's so unfortunate.
[174:06.74]Alright, well whatever.
[174:07.54]Let's go.
[174:09.18]Pick up that last like plasma.
[174:10.96]Pick up that last like virus.
[174:24.12]Walk into my path right now.
[174:31.10]What's with people abandoning this stuff?
[174:34.37]I am going to get rid of this.
[174:35.67]Is this a thing for me?
[174:39.51]Or supports Earth.
[174:41.01]Earth supports Mars.
[174:42.11]EDF.
[174:42.29]We've got to get rid of that.
[174:45.80]We need to take this thing out.
[174:50.91]That's straight up propaganda, you know what I mean?
[174:54.27]Scrap.
[174:57.31]No, no.
[174:57.80]Alright, that's where I gotta go.
[175:02.86]The nano rifle is the best.
[175:07.20]Horn is useful?
[175:07.90]What's the horn?
[175:08.52]G?
[175:17.64]Who went higher, me or him?
[175:18.66]I don't know.
[175:19.70]And he's still alive.
[175:21.80]Some fucking hell, that guy lives.
[175:26.75]I sandwiched that guy in between that.
[175:28.25]There's no way he's getting out of that alive.
[175:34.49]Alright, let's try it.
[175:35.33]Let's go for a liberation here.
[175:37.37]Okay.
[175:46.71]One.
[175:48.59]Two.
[175:52.21]Three.
[175:58.04]Easy.
[176:01.00]And get this.
[176:02.82]Get this.
[176:06.30]There it goes!
[176:12.93]Hopefully it doesn't fall on me.
[176:15.13]Still standing.
[176:16.11]Get down.
[176:18.77]Whoa.
[176:24.60]Whoa.
[176:26.40]Get.
[176:31.78]I'm so glad they can't pull you out of the car in this game.
[176:34.43]That would be a nightmare.
[176:40.39]And this is apparently how we're going to do it.
[176:42.31]I guess that's how we're going to do it.
[176:48.69]I don't have enough.
[176:56.09]How many?
[176:56.39]7?
[176:56.59]I think that's gonna be enough.
[176:57.67]I should get it.
[176:58.09]15%, 10%, get out.
[177:13.17]Liberate scrap It's kind of no I can't I can't just go Reinforcements are in Yeah, that's out of here
[177:43.20]This game looks so much fun.
[177:44.24]It is so much fun.
[177:45.96]Highly, highly recommend this game.
[177:49.15]If you're looking for just, like, straight up a fun fucking game to play, how much is this game?
[177:55.27]Like, please solidify the 100% recommendation to play it.
[177:59.37]How much is this?
[178:00.47]I don't remember how much it is.
[178:01.37]Can't be more than, like, $10 or $20.
[178:11.51]This game's like 5 bucks when it's on sale.
[178:13.33]It's 20 bucks.
[178:13.97]It's worth it.
[178:14.51]For 20 dollars.
[178:16.17]Absolutely.
[178:21.42]If this game was still like 30 bucks, I think it'd be still worth it.
[178:26.30]Is it a helipad?
[178:30.64]Uh.
[178:31.38]Well.
[178:32.74]Need more than that.
[178:38.38]You dead?
[178:40.54]Yeah, I need more than that.
[178:41.60]I don't have enough.
[178:42.74]I don't think... You can't just, like, shoot it, right?
[178:44.32]Well, actually, I could do this.
[178:45.24]I'm gonna take our time with this one, apparently.
[178:49.36]Where did you all come from?
[178:50.48]They came out of nowhere.
[178:53.33]Were they inside?
[178:53.95]Were you guys inside?
[179:07.39]Alert.
[179:08.03]Alright, let's destroy this.
[179:09.19]Come on.
[179:12.60]Take out the support structures.
[179:15.44]Gotta take out the beams.
[179:20.16]Really get underneath like the ring and just start breaking wires.
[179:27.91]We got guerrilla reinforcements.
[179:29.59]That's good.
[179:39.67]Only another beam.
[179:40.51]One more beam and it should go down.
[179:44.91]Alright, I went down.
[179:45.81]Is this still like... I still can't do it.
[179:47.37]Come on, get rid of this too.
[179:51.45]Don't let it land on you.
[179:57.07]Oh my god, you stupid fucking thing.
[179:58.93]Come on, get down.
[180:00.43]Get down.
[180:01.59]How is it still at 13%?
[180:02.25]Got it.
[180:02.65]Nope, didn't get it.
[180:04.55]Oh, shit.
[180:07.77]Oh, shit.
[180:14.63]I got it?
[180:15.59]No, fuck.
[180:19.40]Fuck!
[180:25.70]Bring it around the Rosie, come on.
[180:32.18]That was intense.
[180:33.40]I can't believe I made it out.
[180:34.28]I gotta get one more of the structures.
[180:39.50]They're all gonna wrap around again.
[180:42.64]Here we go!
[180:43.66]Come on!
[180:45.48]There's the one more beam!
[180:47.94]Get it!
[180:53.05]Get it!
[180:54.97]Get this thing!
[180:57.09]Oh my god!
[180:58.49]You fucking stupid thing!
[181:00.27]Drop!
[181:02.79]Drop for Christ's sake!
[181:04.92]Oi!
[181:11.39]Ayayay!
[181:14.39]Alright, we're good.
[181:22.19]Alright, watch out, the guy's behind the portal potty.
[181:23.63]I don't have very much ammo left.
[181:24.81]I'm gonna start collecting stuff.
[181:30.44]New plan.
[181:36.42]New plan!
[181:37.48]Got it.
[181:41.38]I think that guy died accidentally, but it's okay.
[181:42.90]Pick up some scrap.
[181:46.14]Destroyed it.
[181:47.42]Let's go.
[181:50.71]Try to kill one or two of these guys.
[181:52.39]That's how you do it.
[181:55.53]See you later.
[181:58.33]Enjoy your place in hell.
[182:01.91]Any more things we've got up here and the mission.
[182:04.41]Let's go back.
[182:04.91]I have enough scrap now to maybe do some work.
[182:11.30]Gotta go this way.
[182:12.78]Shortcut.
[182:19.19]Humvee Strat, yeah.
[182:20.57]That's the way to do it.
[182:21.29]End this war over there.
[182:23.69]Let me get it.
[182:27.11]That's how you get liberated.
[182:33.54]Up here.
[182:40.36]Get up there.
[182:42.98]I might want a different car too.
[182:44.31]I need 450 for the rocket launcher.
[182:54.07]That's what I'm going to get next.
[182:55.14]450 for the rocket launcher or more ammo for the charges?
[182:59.36]I'm not sure.
[183:05.26]The AI will shoot the charges on your car?
[183:07.53]Really?
[183:14.31]Where did you come from?
[183:18.17]Thank you for your sacrifice.
[183:21.97]Is there an upgraded sledgehammer?
[183:23.14]If there is, then I'm going to get it.
[183:24.16]Are you getting in the car?
[183:27.10]Or are you staying up here?
[183:30.44]You probably should get in the car.
[183:31.38]There's like 12 Master Chiefs coming to get you.
[183:34.06]Get in the car.
[183:39.29]Well, you know, and that's... Okay.
[183:42.21]Okay.
[183:43.99]Goodbye.
[183:44.43]It's been real.
[183:46.78]See you later.
[183:48.46]Thank you for participating.
[183:49.38]Get the fuck out of here.
[184:05.97]Come on.
[184:07.95]Make it happen.
[184:09.05]Make it happen.
[184:13.52]Damn it.
[184:20.66]I tried.
[184:21.18]I tried.
[184:21.54]I couldn't do it in time.
[184:22.36]It's alright.
[184:23.94]I didn't lose out on anything.
[184:28.46]The bridge was just too strong.
[184:30.78]Orc joke 2.
[184:34.48]It doesn't work like that.
[184:35.46]Yeah, well, I didn't have any charges left.
[184:37.38]Just trying to go for the insanity.
[184:38.64]Alright.
[184:41.02]So.
[184:42.30]I have 444.
[184:43.32]I have guns.
[184:45.72]Yeah, but I had a... Come on.
[184:47.48]I had a chance.
[184:49.97]Let's do... Let me go... I'm going to do a bit of the smart thing.
[184:54.70]The smart thing is not get the rocket launcher yet.
[184:56.90]Do increased ammo count.
[184:58.98]Good job.
[185:01.94]Remote charge ammo.
[185:03.56]I'm going to do this one.
[185:06.64]Because the rocket launcher is cool, but I keep running out of this.
[185:13.21]Let's go with this.
[185:15.55]Remote charge ammo.
[185:19.70]If you go and explore the outskirt areas, you can find a weird polearm.
[185:23.06]Yeah, I gotta do the smart thing.
[185:24.34]There's plenty of time to grind for salvage.
[185:31.56]It's definitely worth it.
[185:32.73]So how many can I have now?
[185:34.65]Let's see.
[185:35.03]Alright, I need to go to the thing.
[185:37.73]So I have 18.
[185:38.09]What can it max out to now?
[185:52.21]30 that okay that was worth it that's going to keep me around for so much longer in missions financially stable yeah pretty much from here we're going to go we'll go over here look at all this nonsense we'll go this we'll go liberate here and then go to the mission
[186:24.39]401k stream.
[186:24.87]Are you talking about in-game?
[186:29.13]I have $444.
[186:29.53]That's not very much.
[186:37.33]Would I be willing to be your accountant?
[186:41.63]Not really.
[186:42.99]I'm not that great with money.
[186:50.23]Sprint.
[186:51.23]Sprint.
[186:52.72]Liberation is non-negotiable.
[186:55.04]The drones have seized and fortified the dust town hall.
[186:58.15]Someone needs to level that place.
[187:00.37]Okay.
[187:02.55]I'll do it.
[187:06.57]I'm here.
[187:07.15]I'm here to drive my buggy up the front stairs.
[187:13.59]Come on.
[187:15.33]Ooh, baby.
[187:18.29]Oh, we're inside.
[187:32.75]Oh, Jesus.
[187:34.93]Whoa!
[187:38.33]Alright, now we're inside.
[187:40.40]Get the fuck out of the way.
[187:43.14]Get out of here.
[187:44.52]You dick.
[187:52.81]God.
[187:53.93]Ugh.
[187:56.84]Ah, it's too... Ah!
[187:58.98]I... Going for a... Ah... I got... Ah... I went... This is like a fucking tough place to do.
[188:09.43]I can't make jokes here.
[188:10.65]I still have 30, right?
[188:15.91]That went through still, right?
[188:17.71]Yeah, it did.
[188:18.11]Okay.
[188:21.41]Can't fuck around there.
[188:24.99]And I... I say that as I fucking flip the damn thing over.
[188:31.53]I'm looking over at chat and I'm like, hey, what are people saying?
[188:35.17]Now I need another car.
[188:36.15]Oh, lord.
[188:39.78]We're getting serious.
[188:42.08]No jokes allowed.
[188:43.58]Sometimes you have to have a no jokes allowed part of the stream.
[188:45.86]And what we're going to do now is that.
[188:50.34]Here comes that portion.
[188:52.46]You can turn it over.
[188:53.18]How?
[188:54.61]Is it like GTA where you just hold the button?
[188:56.07]I don't know.
[188:57.85]Use the big truck?
[188:58.49]No, I can't, like, sneak in there.
[188:59.59]You stupid idiot!
[189:03.93]You idiot!
[189:06.89]Okay, I broke that guy's leg.
[189:08.09]Remember when I told you not to run into the base?
[189:19.04]I know, but I don't learn!
[189:20.10]I'll never learn!
[189:23.56]You guys think I'm gonna learn?
[189:25.66]No way.
[189:39.91]How many balls have I driven into now?

[192:26.66]I don't think I'm supposed to be doing this yet.
[192:27.92]I need, like, better weapons.
[192:29.18]But, you know, they think that's going to stop me?
[192:33.32]We got one down already.
[192:34.30]I ain't fucking it up this time.
[192:39.47]We're going right in the front door, and I'm going to destroy the whole place.

[193:56.55]One more over here.
[193:57.17]65%.
[194:05.40]Almost done.
[194:08.10]Gorilla mode activated.
[194:22.26]This is my hiding spot.
[194:22.72]Get out of here.
[194:26.56]Ay yi yi.
[194:27.64]Don't scare me like that dude.
[194:31.81]Thing still needs to go down.
[194:33.17]I gotta go in there with the hammer.
[194:34.97]Whoa!
[194:36.05]Next to the escape route.
[194:43.55]I gotta get in there with the hammer boys and girls.
[195:20.29]Go around.
[195:21.19]Go around.
[195:21.89]Go around.
[195:24.19]There's 3,000 people there.
[195:28.31]Oh, shit.
[195:37.04]Hold on.
[195:37.78]I'm gonna get a different approach.
[195:41.38]What happened?
[196:02.22]Alright, there we go.
[196:05.52]Oh, this thing is slow.
[196:16.03]There it is.
[196:20.38]Take it down.
[196:21.00]That's all she wrote.
[196:25.90]See you later.
[196:27.12]Victory.
[196:32.17]The mole.
[196:36.37]Okay, now we gotta go.
[196:37.20]See you later.
[196:47.44]Good game.
[196:49.56]We got propaganda to take down too.
[196:58.14]Gorilla joined.
[196:58.76]Alright, well, good luck.
[197:00.18]What the hell?
[197:04.02]Is there still a guy in there?
[197:15.14]Easy.
[197:15.40]Alright, gotta go.
[197:17.48]Take down the propaganda.
[197:22.92]Perfect!
[197:27.08]Oh, that's too much fun.
[197:30.06]Awesome.
[197:30.50]Alright, it worked.
[197:35.98]I think that was a success, boys and girls.
[197:45.05]I guess we're being chased.
[197:47.59]Doesn't mean I can't get all my ore.
[197:56.65]Still being chased.
[197:59.35]That's fine.
[197:59.85]Follow me all the way up here.
[198:00.63]I don't care.
[198:07.54]That guy didn't do shit.
[198:09.46]I appreciate the effort, though, my friend.
[198:16.76]Well, that was close that he didn't hit me with that grenade.
[198:19.98]Now we're going to get an escape over here.
[198:21.15]We got the Jeep.
[198:22.31]We're going to go down around the corner.
[198:25.95]Safe.
[198:28.36]Don't die from this.
[198:29.80]Wow.
[198:30.16]Good.
[198:32.18]Wait, I have one exploded bomb?
[198:34.52]Oh, I just detonated a bomb.
[198:37.18]I still had one charge.
[198:43.49]That's so stupid.
[198:44.95]Well, I hope somebody got hurt by that.
[198:48.83]Nice try.
[198:49.37]I appreciate it.
[198:50.27]Appreciate it.
[198:52.35]Let's lose the cops.
[198:56.63]I would prefer not to be doing that.
[198:58.76]Wait, is this another one?
[199:01.92]Oh, dude, don't give me another one of these in a row.
[199:04.04]Okay.
[199:04.56]Okay.
[199:08.41]Okay.
[199:11.03]Out of the frying pan and into the frying pan.
[199:13.01]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[199:13.99]Bad idea.
[199:14.55]Out.
[199:14.89]Get out.
[199:17.25]Bad idea.
[199:29.05]Out of the fire and into the frying pan.
[199:31.07]Whatever that saying is.
[199:32.07]Just lay low right here.
[199:43.36]If you can't take the heat, stay out of the frying pan.
[199:45.25]Exactly.
[199:55.37]Lay low in the sky.
[199:56.81]Yeah.
[199:57.43]Let me like lay low out in the open.
[199:58.85]And that one guy can see me.
[200:00.76]This one guy with his sights.
[200:07.40]I'm not even sure I can kill this guy from this far away.
[200:09.16]Okay, I guess I can.
[200:15.12]There's a guy behind.
[200:15.96]Oh my lord.
[200:16.80]Fine.
[200:20.66]He's got you in his iron sights.
[200:23.34]Here we go.
[200:23.90]That's better.
[200:29.88]Just chill.
[200:38.86]It's time to kick frying pan and chew frying pan.
[200:44.82]Who can still see me?
[200:47.92]We're not still doing this, right?
[200:51.18]There we are.
[200:51.62]Alright.
[200:52.14]Now they're on Metal Gear Solid Yellow.
[200:56.43]Now we're on Metal Gear Solid Orange Yellow.
[200:59.14]Yeah, there's a mission over here.
[201:06.71]There's a lot to do.
[201:08.11]There's a bunch of random missions to do.
[201:09.49]This is a hostage rescue mission.
[201:14.57]I'm not doing that one right now.
[201:16.21]I gotta pee again.
[201:20.41]Give it to me.
[201:20.77]Give me the beacon.
[201:22.15]I wanna... No, I don't... What am I thinking?
[201:24.95]What do I need?
[201:25.53]Alright, over here.
[201:26.39]Uh, let's take this one.
[201:28.33]Uh, I don't have any charges, do I?
[201:29.97]I need to refill my ammo, man.
[201:32.49]Alright, I gotta pee.
[201:46.82]Let me go pee.
[201:47.70]Let me save it.
[201:48.28]I'm going to have to redo this.
[201:49.91]Let me just pee and then save.
[201:53.86]I will be right back.
[201:57.42]Pee streamer activated.
[203:03.49]Wait, what?
[204:13.51]Hi there.
[204:17.85]I don't hear anything.
[204:19.79]What happened?
[204:20.59]Is he still around?
[204:23.41]Is he done?
[204:23.97]By the way, does the stream title make any sense?
[204:27.50]Call him the custodian.
[204:28.44]Like, that makes sense, right?
[204:30.36]Like, I'm, like, cleaning up the fucking town.
[204:31.86]I'm, like, sweeping shit up.
[204:33.26]I don't think that makes any sense.
[204:36.52]I thought it might make sense.
[204:38.68]Fuck, I didn't even get any coffee.
[204:40.02]Ah!
[204:41.34]Oh, well.
[204:42.20]Gonna have to deal with it.
[204:45.95]Okay, that's good.
[204:46.73]Has the audio been okay?
[204:48.78]I haven't been able to monitor it.
[204:50.10]Is the game audio too loud or is it in a good spot?
[204:54.64]What do you guys think?
[205:01.36]That's good.
[205:02.26]It's good.
[205:02.52]It's fine.
[205:02.84]Okay, good.
[205:04.73]My pee was loud.
[205:05.61]Okay.
[205:09.57]Alrighty.
[205:10.33]Let's move this over here.
[205:12.27]Come back.
[205:13.15]I'm going to have to restart the game.
[205:15.86]Unfortunately.
[205:16.44]Let me move that so you can see.
[205:22.12]I am very happy.
[205:23.94]What do you mean there's somebody in my house?
[205:25.30]What are you talking about?
[205:28.25]I saved it already.
[205:28.95]I just have to go back to the main menu.
[205:31.85]I saved it.
[205:36.17]Land game.
[205:37.09]It's been a while since I've heard that terminology.
[205:42.95]Windowed.
[205:44.11]False.
[205:47.69]Keep that setting.
[205:49.39]Uh-huh.
[205:53.58]A little game.
[205:54.24]The one I just did.
[205:55.18]This one.
[205:58.04]Dust.
[205:59.56]I keep thinking this guy is on fire.
[206:00.60]So what did I want to do?
[206:14.56]I could just do the regular... Look at all that.
[206:17.06]Look at all that gold.
[206:19.42]Let's just do the regular mission.
[206:22.92]Obtain red faction orders.
[206:24.05]We'll just do this one.
[206:25.93]But I'm going to have all my ammo.
[206:27.89]Everything's all set.
[206:28.45]We're good.
[206:31.17]We're good.
[206:33.13]Take the buggy.
[206:33.65]Let's do the mission.
[206:36.64]Everybody in the chat is in your house.
[206:38.00]Well, I don't think I could fit 2,000 people in here.
[206:41.85]A little more than 2,000 people would not fit in this house.
[206:44.62]I'm sure I could... You know what?
[206:45.68]Maybe I... No.
[206:46.60]No way.
[206:47.96]I'm trying to think if I put every single person, like single file next to each other, stuffed like shoulder to shoulder.
[206:53.77]We're talking closet space.
[206:55.37]We're talking basement.
[206:56.41]We're talking every single inch of my house.
[206:59.83]Maybe like 325 people would fit in here.
[207:01.91]That's it.
[207:05.50]No more than that.
[207:06.28]Maybe less than 200.
[207:13.32]Maybe if you guys, like, sat down.
[207:15.26]So, if you guys, like, were lying on the ground.
[207:17.90]Like, just straight, like, toy soldier straight.
[207:20.85]Lying like a pencil on the ground.
[207:22.71]And I just piled you on top of each other.
[207:25.23]Sure, like, some of you would die.
[207:27.27]Like, the ones that were on the bottom would die.
[207:29.79]Like, the two layers at the very bottom of, like, the human layer cake with, like, nine stacks high would probably be dead.
[207:36.02]I might be able to get, like, five or six hundred people in there.
[207:41.66]And this is a gas station, so we have to do it.
[207:50.77]It's not what I had in mind.
[207:53.91]Okay.
[207:54.65]Okay.
[208:05.26]We're setting up a new base of operations in the Badlands.
[208:08.02]I want to be in the middle.
[208:09.50]Do you have to pay more money to go on top?
[208:13.28]The Marauders found it and made off with our weapons.
[208:16.54]Our trackers believe they have a hideout near this location.
[208:19.99]Your job is to find it.
[208:21.73]The Marauders have been out here a long time, but we don't have much intel.
[208:26.05]All we know is that they're scavengers.
[208:27.83]I might sound like a broken record, but I really, really like this game a lot.
[208:38.34]We've spotted a marauder vehicle.
[208:40.22]Follow it and see where it goes.
[208:41.82]Alright.
[208:42.24]That means I need your dumb vehicle.
[208:43.80]Except, no, you're not going to give it to me.
[208:46.50]Is there any cars over here that I can just take?
[208:50.59]I have never played this game.
[208:51.71]No.
[208:51.83]Those of you guys asking in chat, I have not played this ever.
[208:56.05]This is the only time I've ever played the game.
[209:01.00]Any chance of doing multiplayer?
[209:06.00]I don't know.
[209:08.28]That's a... Oh, let me just get rid of this shit.
[209:10.82]This is just free.
[209:12.50]You're right, this is just free.
[209:15.04]Get up here.
[209:17.33]How much is left?
[209:43.04]Okay, I didn't hit that guy.
[209:43.92]I missed.
[209:44.32]I didn't hit that guy.
[209:47.46]I did not even come close to hitting that guy.
[210:02.10]Oh, that guy's got a big gun.
[210:07.84]Oh, shit.
[210:08.44]God damn it.
[210:11.36]I just can't...
[210:19.29]Are you telling me that that thing, that Polo hit me in the head and like stuffed me down like they were putting fucking gunpowder into a musket?
[210:34.35]Well, whatever.
[210:39.23]They've spotted a marauder vehicle.
[210:42.11]Follow it and see where it goes.
[210:47.36]That was great.
[210:50.26]The whole pile drove me.
[210:51.56]I was just buried by a head into the ground.
[210:55.22]Well, at least if that one's dead, I can get the other one.
[211:00.68]No, it's not.
[211:03.34]I think, you know, I give too much credit to... I give way too much credit to using me as the bomb.
[211:12.57]Just drive into this shit.
[211:15.37]You know, it's like this shit is way better.
[211:20.07]Just cause total chaos.
[211:23.81]Eventually it's going to go down.
[211:27.07]And I don't even have to worry about my health.
[211:28.81]Look at that.
[211:33.40]It's easy as pie.
[211:37.76]And I can collect shit in the car.
[211:56.16]That one.
[211:56.64]That guy's still fucking alive.
[212:00.28]We got a ton, man.
[212:04.36]Alright, let's call it a gun.
[212:05.50]Let's make this happen.
[212:15.98]There you go.
[212:31.99]That's that one.
[212:32.97]And scrap.
[212:34.41]Not really.
[212:37.97]There's so much ore over here, too.
[212:41.68]There's one more, right?
[212:44.24]Oh, yeah.
[212:44.46]It's over here.
[212:45.40]Oh, I missed that.
[212:58.34]Bye.
[213:04.62]Alright.
[213:05.44]There's one more of this stupid thing.
[213:06.84]I can hit it with the wrench.
[213:12.68]Well, that was lucky.
[213:13.46]That almost just crushed down on my head.
[213:16.95]Liberated.
[213:19.15]Let's go.
[213:23.91]Take cover.
[213:26.19]I know.
[213:27.03]Really.
[213:27.29]Is this time?
[213:28.83]Find the marauders.
[213:29.45]No, it's not time.
[213:30.01]I can get the scrap over there.
[213:37.21]There's lots of it.
[213:39.30]The whole field of it.
[213:40.14]The field of rainbows.
[213:42.26]And scrap.
[213:48.22]Plus six, plus six, plus six.
[213:55.05]Plus six!
[214:04.45]Any more?
[214:05.09]Some of them jumped over here.
[214:06.83]There we go.
[214:12.68]If I fail the mission, I have to do this all over again.
[214:14.90]Well, don't worry.
[214:15.46]I ain't gonna fail it.
[214:17.54]You have any fucking faith in me at all?
[214:19.18]Come on.
[214:19.44]You think I'm gonna fail this mission?
[214:21.08]I'm gonna get the first try.
[214:28.17]Where'd those go?
[214:30.51]Two little spores jumped out.
[214:31.89]Did I get them?
[214:35.70]I guess I did.
[214:36.30]Let's go.
[214:40.20]One more for good luck.
[214:41.24]There it is.
[214:42.80]And this, too.
[214:51.33]I got a lot of scrap for this stuff.
[214:53.11]That was good.
[214:54.37]I'm happy with it.
[214:59.57]Oh, I need another car.
[215:00.71]This thing is a fucking piece of shit.
[215:02.33]This thing is, like, run down at this point.
[215:07.69]Your fifth attempt on the mission?
[215:09.13]No, because I'm gonna save it right here.
[215:11.39]Fuck, I can't.
[215:13.45]Well, whatever.
[215:15.04]I'm just not gonna fail it.
[215:15.90]I'm not gonna fail the mission.
[215:16.90]I'm gonna do it first try.
[215:23.38]I do need to find another car though.
[215:29.30]There's a car right here.
[215:30.56]Steal this one.
[215:31.28]I don't think it belongs to anybody.
[215:35.31]That's close enough.
[215:36.35]If they spot you, this mission is over.
[215:38.29]What do you mean?
[215:38.97]What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?
[215:40.67]They must have a base or outpost nearby.
[215:42.73]What's this red?
[215:43.39]What's red?
[215:44.09]What's the red?
[215:44.57]You'll lose them if you're not careful.
[215:46.67]Hurry up.
[215:47.13]What is happening?
[215:47.73]Get away.
[215:48.61]What's going on?
[215:49.23]Why is this PUBG?
[215:50.80]What the fuck happened?
[215:52.38]No.
[215:53.36]What the?
[215:55.10]What was the red on the map?
[215:56.52]Like, what's even going on?
[215:59.96]What the fuck?
[216:00.56]Like, follow what?
[216:02.81]That was in the middle of nowhere!
[216:04.01]Oh my god.
[216:09.67]It just- okay, he's just like, that's close enough.
[216:11.85]Oh, now we're gonna cover your fucking mini-map with red.
[216:17.36]And get him!
[216:18.40]Oh, you didn't get him, you had four seconds.
[216:21.62]What the fuck was that shit?
[216:31.23]And now I gotta do that, you know, no, I'm just going by it.
[216:33.51]Like, what a crock of shit.
[216:36.53]Find the marauders.
[216:37.85]Oh, hey, you got close enough.
[216:40.28]Go, hurry up!
[216:41.30]Go quick!
[216:42.70]Oh, you didn't go fast enough.
[216:44.60]What happened?
[216:47.08]I told you to go.
[216:48.90]If they spot you, this mission is over.
[216:50.72]Did you see the pod racer?
[216:53.17]They must have a base or outpost nearby.
[216:57.75]You need to pull back before they spot you.
[217:13.43]Watch out for Bobulsa.
[217:14.73]What was his name?
[217:17.73]Bobulsa?
[217:18.81]Bobulsa?
[217:20.72]Who was the guy that ran the pod racing thing?
[217:30.18]Sebulba.
[217:35.00]Like, he can't see me right now.
[217:36.39]Give me a break.
[217:38.62]That fucking tailing mission.
[217:39.92]He's gonna go into a portal.
[217:41.90]You're gonna put portals in this game.
[217:44.54]That was the mission.
[217:45.12]What?
[217:45.22]What did I do?
[217:45.68]Okay.
[217:45.94]I was supposed to do that.
[217:47.32]I was supposed to do time travel.
[217:48.85]Find the marauder base.
[218:09.29]So much stuff over here.
[218:14.51]There it is.
[218:14.95]I found a marauder vehicle, but no marauders.
[218:18.21]I want to get in it.
[218:18.84]I want to drive it.
[218:19.38]The entrance to their base must be nearby.
[218:21.86]Find it.
[218:24.04]How does this thing work?
[218:26.24]Oh, wow, this thing's crazy.
[218:29.06]Oh, that shoots something.
[218:30.84]No, don't get... Get back in the car.
[218:35.63]There's the entrance.
[218:39.39]This thing is not designed to go around tight corners.
[218:48.57]We're gonna make it work.
[218:51.02]This must be it.
[219:02.73]Hey!
[219:03.63]I brought the vehicle back!
[219:08.08]I guess that's why they left it there.
[219:10.54]Oh no, this whole place is coming down.
[219:21.44]What if I just caused myself a problem?
[219:23.28]I'm going to be so angry.
[219:27.89]What is doing that?
[219:29.47]I think I did that.
[219:30.85]Search for the missing weapon cache.
[219:38.14]I'm gonna assume it's over there.
[219:39.34]Did I put just enough stress on this building for this to be a problem?
[219:52.15]Missing weapons cache.
[219:58.29]You guys see any boxes?
[220:07.13]Did I miss it up here?
[220:18.87]Okay, well.
[220:22.62]Where's the weapons cache?
[220:29.10]Can I, like, get up there?
[220:30.00]Let's just start taking the building out.
[220:41.82]I don't want to use a bomb in here, though.
[220:44.10]I don't want to blow the thing up.
[220:45.34]What about up here?
[220:49.08]No, here we go.
[220:49.50]I can go this way.
[220:55.61]That's not smart.
[220:56.55]I don't know why I'm doing that.
[221:02.25]I'm getting some interference.
[221:03.69]That was weird.
[221:05.41]Did they add a supernatural element to this game at this point?
[221:09.17]Is it actually funny, goofy, scary aliens?
[221:13.51]Okay.
[221:14.35]Oh.
[221:21.56]Shit.
[221:24.36]God damn it.
[221:30.24]It was like a way to go.
[221:31.29]Like over this way.
[221:36.23]Up here.
[221:44.73]Alright, keep speaking in tongues, it's fine.
[221:51.71]Like a gas leak.
[221:58.05]No need to not say that.
[222:03.33]Now what?
[222:04.39]Maybe come all the way out here for nothing?
[222:13.10]This looks like a building to crash through.
[222:25.45]I better not fuck this up.
[222:36.17]I don't want to have to do this whole thing again.
[222:42.96]Spooky.
[222:45.90]This voice is actually pretty eerie though, I'm not gonna lie.
[222:51.41]Which way?
[222:53.55]In here maybe?
[222:59.39]That fell pretty easily.
[223:01.67]Do these explode?
[223:03.41]Okay, there it is.
[223:05.81]Pick up the artifact.
[223:10.52]I've got some kind of device here.
[223:13.68]I've never seen anything like it.
[223:15.00]Sam better have a look.
[223:18.14]Here's where I get... This is where I'm going to get in trouble.
[223:20.63]Reek the spotted idiot.
[223:22.57]Yep.
[223:23.45]Of course.
[223:24.79]Say again?
[223:25.61]I'm losing you.
[223:27.57]This is where I get swarmed by the Marmorators.
[223:30.11]I'm going to be in deep shit.
[223:34.74]Yep.
[223:35.64]Mm-hmm.
[223:37.94]Get out alive.
[223:49.60]Don't lose this.
[223:50.16]I'm gonna be so, so upset.
[223:51.98]Guys down there.
[223:53.42]Alright, so... Don't fucking die.
[223:54.32]No jumping.
[223:54.62]I'll jump and fall through the ceiling like an idiot.
[223:56.80]Guaranteed.
[223:57.16]I'll be a moron and that'll happen.
[224:24.55]You just kicked your friend.
[224:25.51]What a disrespectful thing to do.
[224:34.12]Get me out alive.
[224:37.66]You guys wrapped around all the way, didn't you?
[224:42.22]Okay.
[224:43.62]Get out.
[224:46.70]That's... Oh, I love it.
[224:50.44]This is my pod racing.
[224:58.39]Should I jump with the podracer?
[224:59.37]No.
[224:59.45]I'm just gonna run by.
[225:01.11]That's an absolute certain death.
[225:06.43]Just take it slow.
[225:08.51]Wow!
[225:12.53]What in the name of... What in the name of... How was I supposed to know that?
[225:20.74]We're gonna podrace out of here.
[225:35.98]No, we're not, actually.
[225:36.80]We're not going to do that.
[225:38.00]The EDF are moving in force on your position.
[225:40.46]Get out or they pin you down.
[225:46.29]Oh, this is... This is... This is interesting.
[225:49.83]This is new.
[225:55.57]Okay, bye.
[225:58.55]That was, uh... That was interesting.
[226:00.21]Okay, see ya.
[226:04.57]Somebody just dropped a nuke over there.
[226:06.11]Okay.
[226:06.77]I'm going this way.
[226:07.31]I'm supposed to take the Marauder Car and run.
[226:13.68]Well, I made it out fine.
[226:15.00]I'm fine.
[226:17.38]We're not dead.
[226:18.06]No one's chasing us.
[226:19.04]We don't have any problems.
[226:21.02]We're completely problem free.
[226:25.34]Missions like that we can't fuck around.
[226:27.12]I can't stick around.
[226:29.38]I am going to do what I'm supposed to do.
[226:30.70]Because that mission, I don't want to do it again.
[226:32.90]Because you saw what happened when I tried to attempt it three times.
[226:35.42]Propaganda.
[226:41.53]Out of here.
[226:47.75]I love the jumping swing.
[226:48.89]It's so much fun.
[226:52.44]You just have to run 30 miles.
[226:58.82]That's not necessarily true.
[226:59.84]I'll find a car.
[227:01.92]See?
[227:03.22]Found one.
[227:05.28]I don't know if it works, but I found a car.
[227:09.34]No, that's a broken down dump truck.
[227:11.06]That thing is not gonna work.
[227:13.42]Unfortunately.
[227:17.40]That sucks.
[227:23.53]I blew up the warning signs.
[227:25.13]Hey, we got a mine, though.
[227:29.65]What if Dark Souls had vehicles?
[227:32.39]Oh, that would be a completely different game.
[227:39.78]I wanted to get these anyways.
[227:40.64]I'm okay with this.
[227:46.92]The mech... I can get a mech?
[227:51.81]I'm glad the game keeps it interesting long enough for you to find and care about the upgrades.
[227:59.28]Because it'd be one thing if they, right off the bat, were like, oh, here's like a giant fucking helicopter that you can rain hell down.
[228:03.76]No, like, actually, I gotta use the hammer.
[228:08.94]I actually have to use this thing.
[228:16.54]Why am I still being looked at?
[228:18.82]Red alert?
[228:20.12]Shouldn't there not be red alert right now?
[228:26.03]Alright, we're gonna get to a stopping point here soon.
[228:30.44]I've been streaming for about four hours, so it's a little bit longer.
[228:32.90]Let's get to a good stopping position.
[228:38.75]Because we are absolutely going to continue to play this.
[228:42.75]On the next stream, for sure.
[228:48.72]This would be so much better with flying vehicles, but it might not be.
[228:51.22]It might not be that much better.
[228:59.02]Because if you're in the air, I mean, if there's no threat or danger or no... I mean, destroying buildings is fun from the ground.
[229:05.70]From the air, though, it might be too easy.
[229:08.50]Oh, shit.
[229:09.10]This is not going to happen.
[229:10.91]Can I make this?
[229:12.99]I don't think I can make this jump.
[229:14.99]But there is a car there, though.
[229:16.91]That is a car.
[229:18.77]I wish he would get up here.
[229:20.87]Alright, easy.
[229:22.49]Easy, buddy.
[229:26.03]Um... Shit.
[229:27.19]Shit.
[229:32.86]Slow down, man.
[229:33.74]Don't you dare knock this shit away from me.
[229:36.06]Come on.
[229:37.48]There's marauders over there, too.
[229:40.98]He's dead.
[229:41.38]Guy driving the car.
[229:52.33]Get me in the car.
[229:52.93]Let me in the car.
[229:53.99]Get in the car.
[229:55.57]Why can I not get in one of these cars?
[229:57.19]Get out.
[229:59.11]Get out of the car.
[230:02.69]Get the fuck out of the car.
[230:04.39]I can't get in this car.
[230:06.55]Why?
[230:08.01]Why?
[230:16.90]Get me in one of the cars.
[230:20.16]I can't get in.
[230:21.76]I'm so fucked.
[230:26.04]I don't have any bullets.
[230:29.24]I just got like a red face.
[230:33.70]Don't you dare.
[230:41.48]Don't run me over.
[230:43.42]That guy's still attached.
[230:46.53]They won't get out of the cars.
[230:48.05]He's trying to run me down.
[230:49.71]They're trying to run me down, guys.
[230:52.07]What is this?
[230:52.57]Oh, sitting duck.
[230:54.68]Get me in the car, please.
[230:56.60]Oh!
[231:03.95]Can't get in any of these fucking cars Don't No
[231:43.26]We made it.
[231:44.58]I actually did it.
[231:46.70]Thank God.
[231:48.20]Holy shit, that was fucking insane.
[231:50.38]Oh, my brain hurts.
[231:52.94]Oh.
[231:55.55]We did it.
[231:57.55]Thank the Lord.
[232:02.07]Congratulations.
[232:03.59]Get the artifact to Sam.
[232:05.03]Sam, take it.
[232:08.30]Oh, goodness gracious.
[232:09.90]You know what this thing is?
[232:11.98]Maybe.
[232:12.94]I'll need some time.
[232:14.84]Alright.
[232:15.54]Just holler if I can get you anything.
[232:18.12]That was intense.
[232:19.64]Got it.
[232:20.20]We're good.
[232:23.99]Local madman crosses desert with 18 cars chasing him.
[232:31.37]We have an actual cutscene here.
[232:32.95]Incoming SATCOM from the Hydra, Earth Defense Fleet.
[232:37.51]I need a status report, General.
[232:38.95]What's going on down there?
[232:40.04]Intelligence confirms that a red faction gorilla is in possession of the Nano Forge.
[232:44.48]The insurgent has been identified as Alec Mason.
[232:47.90]He apparently acquired the device in the Altar Mining Facility.
[232:51.41]Is the forge operational?
[232:53.07]Has it been replicated?
[232:54.65]That's the image they used?
[232:56.17]That's the video they used?
[233:00.49]You don't have any other footage of me doing something?
[233:02.23]And I look right in the camera like, oh shit, they got me.
[233:05.53]Everyone in this game looks the same.
[233:06.63]Everyone just kind of just bald head with a little bit of scruff.
[233:29.91]Don't you know, back in, like, 2009, when this game came out, every protagonist had to be bald guy, kind of, with, like, maybe, like, a shaved head, but with some scruff.
[233:37.80]That was every main character, and every character in every video game.
[233:41.18]It's important.
[233:43.64]Alright.
[233:44.90]I think this is probably a good place to stop.
[233:46.82]Let me just take a look.
[233:48.53]Let me get it saved.
[233:50.25]There's that.
[233:55.79]What have we got here?
[233:58.83]Yeah, I've been going for about four hours.
[234:03.47]Rough scruff.
[234:07.17]I need to get some food.
[234:09.07]Never stop streaming.
[234:10.45]I actually streamed every single day this week.
[234:12.61]So, that was... I haven't done that in a while.
[234:17.84]Five days in a row.
[234:19.08]I didn't take a break at all this whole week.
[234:21.30]Well, I mean, Wednesday was only like an hour, but still.
[234:25.10]I am going to tell you something right now.
[234:31.38]This is a great game.
[234:34.06]I'm having a ton of fun.
[234:35.88]So we absolutely are going to play this again on Tuesday.
[234:39.51]Tuesday is going to be this.
[234:42.77]We're going to continue.
[234:45.45]For sure, this is probably one of my favorite games that I've played on stream.
[234:50.88]And probably like a month or two.
[234:53.28]Like, it's been like a while since I've had, like, I've been like, I mine the ore!
[234:56.78]This is so much fun!
[234:59.12]Uh, it's really good.
[235:01.30]So, we'll see you on Tuesday.
[235:04.56]With more Red Faction Gorilla.
[235:05.74]Uh, and I will see you guys later.
[235:12.26]Thank you so much, everybody, for hanging out.
[235:17.02]Check you soon.
[235:19.48]Much love.
[235:21.98]Daily stream game for, uh, and if there is multiplayer still, like, if the servers still work, maybe we could try to do that, like, at some point next week.
[235:31.04]But, as always, oh, well, Lamb, Lamb Lamb, thanks for the 15 bucks.
[235:34.97]Sleep tight.
[235:35.59]Thank you, Lamb Lamb.
[235:37.37]And thank you to all the subs, all the resubs, all you guys.
[235:39.07]You guys are fucking awesome.
[235:41.65]And goodnight, everybody.
[235:42.97]See you soon.
[235:55.44]you
[236:29.85]I just went to the fucking moon.
[236:31.77]Goodnight, everybody.
[237:05.15]Thank you.
[237:40.01]you
