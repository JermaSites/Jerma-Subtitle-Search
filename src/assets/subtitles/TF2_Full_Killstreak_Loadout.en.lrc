[00:04.87]Hello, what is going on everybody?
[00:06.32]Star here.
[00:07.08]Man vs. Machine recently added a whole bunch of different qualities of items into the game.
[00:12.18]Cool rewards for completing the missions unlike before where you just get like dangling ball sacks on your weapons.
[00:17.57]Like dude, the sniper can't hold up.
[00:19.35]A freaking metal head with chains on a sniper rifle doesn't even look right.
[00:22.97]I never liked that stuff.
[00:24.15]I always felt MVM needed some better rewards and now we got them.
[00:27.07]We have specialized killstreaked weapons equipped right now so my items are going to glow.
[00:31.46]They're going to count the kills that I get, and I thought you guys would appreciate a video of all this to show you, explain it if you didn't know what was going on, and try and get as high of a killstreak as I could after putting this whole set of items together.
[00:43.67]It counts the kills between all of the items because they're all killstreak items, and my Market Gardener, I felt it was necessary to get the highest quality of one of those.
[00:51.42]It's professional quality Market Gardener, so when I have five kills, my eyes will glow while I have it out.
[00:58.10]Behind, be careful.
[01:00.05]Oh, and you're taunting, too.
[01:01.19]What a dick.
[01:01.67]That's a spy!
[01:02.59]That's a spy!
[01:03.09]You're gonna get backstabbed!
[01:05.89]I wanted to show off the eyes!
[01:07.99]Gotta show off the eyes, man.
[01:09.75]Gonna be your demise.
[01:12.15]Yeah, awesome.
[01:13.03]There's a whole bunch of different effects for the eyes.
[01:14.80]You only have them when you have five kills in a killstreak.
[01:17.74]I thought it was gonna be exclusive, like I needed five Market Gardener kills, because that's the weapon that has it, but it doesn't really keep that.
[01:24.70]You can get it with the rocket launcher and just pull out the Market Gardener.
[01:27.38]Be like, ah, look!
[01:28.10]But I have specialized.
[01:29.84]And you know what?
[01:30.39]A lot of the stuff about this was misleading to me.
[01:32.75]Or at least maybe I just made assumptions that no one else was making.
[01:35.77]And I was trying to make my specialized rocket launcher the first time I was trying to do that.
[01:41.07]It was so freaking confusing not knowing like what exactly was it that I needed.
[01:46.36]And I bought parts that I didn't actually need that seemed like the parts I might have needed.
[01:51.64]I think I've got it all a bit figured out now.
[01:54.08]I'm probably not the best person to explain it at this point anyway, but it's a kind of interesting economy where
[01:59.70]you always get the parts to make a killstreak item at the end of an MVM tour.
[02:04.80]In order to make a specialized weapon, you need to destroy other killstreak weapons that you've made of the normal killstreak quality.
[02:12.50]So you're like destroying killstreak weapons to make killstreak weapons, and everybody likes to have their weapon shiny, so you're going to do it, apparently.
[02:21.94]Also, a lot of the stuff that I got, I just went on the Steam Community Market because I figured...
[02:27.30]F*** y'all.
[02:28.16]All y'all.
[02:29.19]You don't like me, blow me.
[02:30.69]As I think words spoken by Dr. Dre.
[02:35.33]Quite the insight on life he had.
[02:38.43]You know, it's like you all forgot about Dre, but he was there the whole time.
[02:42.63]Okay?
[02:45.08]Okay, yeah, right, sure.
[02:47.43]In the description, there actually is a link to something that's really informative about this whole thing that shows pictures for every single specialized eyes, shows all the different sheen colors, tells you how to get them, what that's all about.
[03:00.24]If you don't want to listen to me...
[03:02.30]I can understand why after whatever that last joke was then that's down there anyways really nice to play man versus machine again because you know it's so hard to find people to play with and I always only like to play with people that I know and you know get together and do that but it's always a problem and again I'm realizing you know it's been a while since this update came out and it's quickly become a problem again where even if you find six people including yourself who want to play man versus machine
[03:30.72]Do you all have the same mission?
[03:32.78]Do you all need the same mission?
[03:34.26]Because if you don't need that mission, you're going to complete it and get absolutely nothing for doing it.
[03:39.11]You don't lose your ticket, but it's just like, oh, well, I would have, like, appreciated doing something that, like...
[03:46.54]And MVM needs a point.
[03:48.12]It's a fun game mode, but you need that reward at the end.
[03:51.38]And I've probably done about four tours, maybe three to four tours worth of man versus machine missions that I have not gotten any rewards for because, you know, it was missions I didn't even need to do.
[04:03.48]After a while, of course, Stu, it just turns into a grind where you and the people you work together with have done the mission so many times, there's only a limited number of classes you're going to be playing with a limited number of weapons.
[04:14.15]You know what's going to happen.
[04:15.35]There's no more surprises.
[04:17.23]It's been around long enough that we all know what's going on.
[04:19.23]And I think a really simple thing that would just make MVM way more interesting is that there's all these weapons in the game.
[04:25.64]The revolvers for Spy, the SMG for Sniper, the Righteous Bison, that would be kinda cool to see how, like, that thing's shooting fast like a machine gun piercing through robots, but all of these weapons do not have, like, damage bonuses on them.
[04:39.36]Why not?
[04:40.29]I don't know, is it to balance it?
[04:41.85]I don't really think MVM is something that needs strictly to be balanced.
[04:46.15]I mean, they certainly did a number on Medic this time with that shield.
[04:49.35]Is it really that big of a deal to have a damage bonus on, like, pistols in comparison to that?
[04:53.85]I guess that's my one major complaint at this point, because my favorite thing in Man vs. Machine when it first came out was to try out all these different weapons.
[05:00.59]Like, what does this weapon do when it's fully upgraded?
[05:03.71]Like, how crazy can we get this weapon to be?
[05:06.34]And as it turns out, most of them, not so useful.
[05:09.98]Pretty much the primary weapons for each class.
[05:12.42]Anyway, hope you enjoyed the video.
[05:13.70]If you found Australian weapons yourself while doing this, you know, you can go ahead and brag about that now.
[05:18.14]I don't... You're gonna do it.
[05:20.36]So whatever.
[05:22.70]26 killstreak.
[05:24.92]Oh, wow.
[05:25.74]That's so cool.
[06:06.21]Come here!
[06:06.61]No!
