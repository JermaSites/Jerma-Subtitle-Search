[00:04.32]What is this item?
[00:09.16]It's me and Jerma versus 21 enemy combatants.
[00:12.80]Let's go.
[00:14.84]You're not doing anything!
[00:16.08]You're not doing anything!
[00:17.42]Skeletons!
[00:18.84]You were supposed to be helping me!
[00:22.13]I'm trying to figure out the buttons.
[00:24.33]Don't worry, when I spawn right now, my G is... What are you doing?
[00:30.17]I'm summoning meteors to deal with our foes.
[00:33.19]Alright, I'm coming out.
[00:33.95]Don't worry, don't worry.
[00:34.81]Both your hands!
[00:38.33]Time to time for the skeleton.
[00:39.39]This is gonna lag so much.
[00:41.70]Oh, you better believe it is.
[00:43.08]Here come the skeletons.
[00:46.40]You wanna fuck with the infinite skeletons?
[00:51.10]I... I need a reset.
[00:54.10]We just got, like, destroyed.
[00:59.22]I think we're all set.
[01:00.10]I think we're set.
[01:00.86]Let's go.
[01:01.20]Let's go.
[01:02.22]You... What?
[01:03.38]What?
[01:03.58]What's going on?
[01:05.39]What's happening?
[01:07.45]Okay.
[01:08.41]Okay.
[01:08.91]Get to the front.
[01:10.55]Get to the front quick.
[01:11.67]I'm on no clipping.
[01:12.43]I'm just throwing skeletons everywhere.
[01:16.21]I'm dead.
[01:18.96]I killed everything.
[01:20.32]I don't even know what's dead.
[01:21.52]You're just like writing fire down.
[01:27.09]I'm unstoppable.
[01:28.19]I hit him direct.
[01:29.89]Oh, that was such a panic.
[01:31.81]You know, we gotta... I'm waiting for you on top of the hill.
[01:34.73]Go back to the next point.
[01:36.42]Okay.
[01:36.88]Because we need to have a defense at this next point.
[01:40.16]I'm gonna have, like, a thousand skeletons at this next point.
[01:43.18]Okay, their AI, like, doesn't exist until people come near them.
[01:46.00]Like, okay, someone's being nearby for them to start running.
[01:49.68]Well, here comes, like, the entire... Here they go!
[01:53.80]Oh my god!
[01:56.56]This is so laggy!
[01:58.96]I can't see anything!
[02:00.30]It's just a skeleton army!
[02:03.96]Yeah, they're like 20 frames per second.
[02:07.89]They all just like destroy the- If you get low on health, kill someone with your secondary bullshit weapon.
[02:13.89]They can't even get up here, dude.
[02:17.01]The amount of skeletons and the amount of just fire that's everywhere.
[02:20.49]They're pushing the cart, they're getting through the tunnel.
[02:22.69]I'm going- I'm throwing skeletons in tunnel.
[02:25.36]Oh my god, that guy killed me.
[02:30.11]This is so dumb.
[02:31.21]No, heavy zombie.
[02:32.61]Where are they coming from?
[02:35.13]How did he get behind?
[02:35.93]Oh, I guess they went all the way around.
[02:37.09]Nope, caber.
[02:38.20]I'm coming, I'm coming.
[02:39.98]Don't let him catch.
[02:43.06]Don't let him win.
[02:43.94]No!
[02:45.92]Oh my god, they're at the spawn right now.
[02:49.80]Use the secondary, your machine gun.
[02:51.56]It's way better.
[02:52.14]Secondary?
[02:52.58]Oh, it's better.
[02:53.72]It heals you when you kill people.
[02:54.90]It's insane.
[02:55.60]It also headshots.
[02:57.04]It does everything.
[02:57.90]Why didn't you tell me this thing existed?
[02:59.38]I said it before!
[03:00.98]I didn't know this was this ridiculous.
[03:02.48]That's a spy behind you!
[03:05.24]That wasn't me.
[03:05.96]I don't know why I didn't tell you until just then.
[03:08.16]Where's the scout?
[03:11.90]Yeah, this machine gun.
[03:13.28]I had no idea.
[03:14.04]I was using, like, a flare gun.
[03:15.06]Yeah, no, that thing sucks.
[03:20.36]I don't think they're gonna win though.
[03:22.21]They're gonna come through this choke.
[03:24.03]They're never gonna be able to cap this point.
[03:27.07]If we just stand up there, there's no way they cap it.
[03:30.35]It's gonna be impossible.
[03:34.79]No, he actually got through it all!
[03:37.84]He cheated.
[03:39.74]Don't worry.
[03:40.62]They're not getting by this.
[03:42.80]I can promise you that.
[03:44.16]Yeah, just make sure no one comes up behind you in flanks or anything like that.
[03:47.62]The skeletons are walking around back there.
[03:48.94]That's how you know.
[03:50.18]Go!
[03:50.84]Go, skeleton!
[03:51.74]Overwhelm them!
[03:56.76]Oh, my goodness.
[03:59.89]I love that that kills everybody.
[04:02.83]Oh, it's insane.
[04:03.87]They're ubered outside the door.
[04:05.27]He's on, like, the cart.
[04:14.18]This is scary tense, actually.
[04:17.61]I don't want to lose.
[04:18.49]We got nine minutes to hold this, though.
[04:20.35]I don't think it's possible.
[04:21.53]This whole room, I don't know, dude.
[04:23.69]There's so many skeletons that are spawning right now in this room.
[04:27.17]It's getting to levels where I think your server is going to crash.
[04:30.41]I don't think so.
[04:32.27]They're so focused on the cart being full of people.
[04:35.82]It's just surrounded by skeleton body parts.
[04:38.24]It's fire.
[04:40.24]It's skeletons and fire.
[04:42.42]I'm pretty sure we can do this for nine minutes.
[04:44.95]Maybe actually now that they are trying to get through this tiny little choke More skeletons This thing is ridiculous No, no, no heavy on the cart Get him skeletons.
[05:02.89]I didn't even see what shot me because I was changing spells They're on it right now.
[05:08.31]It's over we lose oh We lose the game
[05:14.83]Oh, maybe not.
[05:15.45]Yeah, we lost.
[05:19.85]Round two.
[05:20.70]Are there any other, like, crazy things to do?
[05:23.26]Yeah, there's plenty.
[05:26.56]We have to do it in four minutes.
[05:27.92]We need to be on the cart the whole time.
[05:30.88]My binoculars power is gone.
[05:32.60]Oh, that scout just got wrecked.
[05:35.79]Do you have binoculars still?
[05:37.79]I gave it to us again.
[05:38.65]It's because it's... Okay, I know what to do.
[05:42.97]But oculus everywhere alright Yeah, I did seriously.
[05:48.73]There's no way you stay on the cart They stick you to the cart I died What is even happening right now like for real?
[05:57.81]But oculus's are all shooting themselves really look at they're like hitting each other None of these binoculars are doing shit
[06:08.54]Oh.
[06:09.54]No.
[06:10.48]Teach them the lesson that it's not okay to play on this server.
[06:17.58]Okay, really?
[06:18.84]Really?
[06:19.52]You know what?
[06:20.23]We're just like hackers right now.
[06:21.87]Like, seriously?
[06:23.11]I'm just feeling mean right now.
[06:24.47]I'm gonna turn it off.
[06:25.41]No more note clips.
[06:26.39]Like, this is just... We're just... This is just... This is no chance!
[06:30.11]As soon as I turned it off and land, there was a spy behind me.
[06:44.09]Thanks for watching!
