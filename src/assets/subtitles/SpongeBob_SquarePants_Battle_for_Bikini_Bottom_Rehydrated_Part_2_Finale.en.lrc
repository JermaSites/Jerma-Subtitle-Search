[00:30.14]What if you have not finished the other VOD?
[00:34.58]Well, just save them.
[00:38.10]Just save them for a rainy day.
[00:43.34]Why am I live right now?
[00:45.10]I'm a couple hours early than typical, than usual.
[00:55.59]There are some new emotes.
[00:59.14]Some that I ripped from Better twitch.tv.
[01:05.71]And some that are new.
[01:06.59]Hey, remember that emote that I said was going to be here?
[01:19.00]Just about a year and two months ago?
[01:22.54]Well, there it is.
[01:25.60]Remember when I played The Thing last weekend?
[01:28.78]Wasn't that a really funny stream?
[01:30.46]We had a bunch of fun.
[01:31.80]Why are people getting banned?
[01:46.35]Too early.
[01:47.89]Too early.
[01:48.50]Leave.
[01:50.00]No, I'm not leaving.
[01:57.05]I remember that like it was yesterday.
[01:59.99]Uh, dude.
[02:01.93]Okay.
[02:02.31]It was, uh, yes, it was yesterday.
[02:04.91]Are you alright?
[02:16.38]Yeah, there's a look at me.
[02:18.68]There's also, I don't know why I enabled it, but there's also me ripping a t-shirt off.
[02:24.21]Somebody just linked it and said, hey dude, enable this.
[02:27.48]Okay.
[02:30.18]When you guys get me in one of those days where I'm incredibly impressionable, I'll do anything.
[02:39.84]I activated like five new emotes yesterday just because it was like, yeah, people told me, yeah.
[02:45.68]I'll turn this one on.
[02:55.06]We're going to do more Battle for Bikini Bottom rehydrated.
[03:00.44]And speaking of being hydrated.
[03:03.09]Okay, let's do the complete opposite and drink a coffee.
[03:07.07]Let's shrivel up.
[03:11.95]It's early though.
[03:12.61]It's not even 10 o'clock in the morning.
[03:20.11]Yeah, hydrate bot.
[03:21.28]Where's shrivel bot?
[03:26.24]Where's the thing that says, hey, you haven't drank water in over four hours.
[03:29.44]Don't do it.
[03:30.62]Turn to dust.
[03:35.74]What's today's sponsor?
[03:37.03]I don't have sponsors.
[03:37.79]What are you talking about?
[03:47.45]I've been trying to drink more water.
[03:49.45]Trying to stay more hydrated.
[03:54.33]You know, for a while, I had an app on my phone that told me when to drink water.
[04:00.31]I'm not kidding.
[04:01.46]I downloaded an app that told me when to drink water.
[04:06.20]It was a notification when... Actually, that's a lie.
[04:09.50]It went like... It made this cool water sound.
[04:12.80]Like... It's like, hey, it's time to drink.
[04:17.99]And the thing just got annoying.
[04:20.73]You know, you're supposed to drink.
[04:23.27]Like 8 to 10 glasses of water a day.
[04:28.70]Getting 10 notifications a day is too much for me.
[04:36.30]Getting 3 notifications a day on my phone is too much for me.
[04:43.47]Drink a pool.
[04:48.90]How many times have you guys had an app that gave you notifications that within one time of it happening, you went, nah, I'm fucking deleting this.
[04:57.62]I don't want this.
[04:58.80]Because you were like in the middle of like, you were in the middle of like reading a newspaper or something, or you were in the middle of like a game or something like that, and it just annoyed you.
[05:07.94]You didn't.
[05:08.59]Now, whatever that is, turn it off.
[05:10.33]I never want to hear it again.
[05:11.27]It's like, well, I did that.
[05:12.49]I wanted that.
[05:19.01]Oh, yeah.
[05:19.35]Notification.
[05:19.71]Yeah, that would be cool.
[05:20.55]It'll notify me of something important.
[05:23.63]Don't fucking do that ever again.
[05:25.02]Give me the phone.
[05:25.98]Give the fucking thing to me.
[05:27.44]Where's the... There it is.
[05:28.54]Don't ever do that again, motherfucker.
[05:33.43]What's wrong with humans?
[05:36.11]Why are we like this?
[05:45.17]Jeremiah Punching.
[05:47.28]I feel like that's gonna be used in a good way.
[05:50.84]Jeremiah Punching is the thing.
[05:56.68]Yeah, better twitch.tv.
[05:59.42]I got $100 from KXZ.
[06:01.14]Thank you, KXZ, for the fucking $100.
[06:07.79]It's good to be back.
[06:09.77]Thank you.
[06:12.53]That's $100? $100?
[06:14.74]Jerma WILD 2, yeah, Jerma WILD 2 is there.
[06:20.08]I didn't enable 1 or 3, I just did 2.
[06:29.27]It's scary.
[06:33.35]Why not Jerma PSYCHO?
[06:36.98]I don't know.
[06:37.40]Why do I have 2?
[06:40.76]Wait, hold on a minute.
[06:44.82]Why is there a save file here with 30 spatulas at 5 p.m.?
[06:49.69]And why is there one at 6 p.m.?
[06:51.83]Why is there one a full hour later?
[06:58.82]This is an autosave.
[06:59.82]Did I... How long was this open?
[07:04.58]Which one's the real one?
[07:09.17]I should do the one that was later, right?
[07:17.10]Wait, did I end the stream and just leave it at this screen and just go, like, fuck off and eat?
[07:23.20]And then come back in an hour and go, oh, shut up, whoops.
[07:26.80]That's definitely what happened.
[07:29.89]Well, welcome back to Bikini Bottom, guys.
[07:32.21]I'm your host.
[07:33.35]Alright, I won't do that this early.
[07:34.63]It's too early for that.
[07:38.93]It's too early to be a dickhead, you know what I mean?
[07:41.06]Somebody knows what I mean.
[07:43.40]It's too early for like the... Yeah, it is.
[07:45.26]Alright.
[07:45.70]What was the... What was I... Ooh, Goo Lagoon.
[07:48.00]Somebody said to go here because they said this is the cool part.
[07:55.39]Oh, whoopee.
[07:56.59]Sorry.
[07:57.73]Sorry.
[07:58.61]Oh, this does look cool.
[08:12.50]I love the beach.
[08:13.86]It's one thing I miss in Vegas.
[08:16.06]No beach.
[08:18.52]You can use the bubble bash to move things.
[08:25.37]Okay.
[08:25.67]It's not the same.
[08:26.21]There's no beach.
[08:35.48]What about Lake Mead?
[08:38.20]I'm not going to Lake Mead.
[08:41.43]What do you mean Lake Mead?
[08:46.32]Lake Mead, there's like, there's like, isn't there like stories, isn't there like a bunch of fucking dead animals and like dead bodies in there and stuff?
[08:52.66]I don't want to go in there.
[08:55.84]It's true.
[09:04.01]I don't know what the hell, I don't want to go in Lake Mead.
[09:10.98]The game's quiet.
[09:12.15]I'll turn it up.
[09:13.43]This robot is called Monsoon.
[09:14.73]Watch out for his lightning attack.
[09:19.29]Can I kill him?
[09:21.99]One hit.
[09:24.01]One hit.
[09:26.19]That was a farting and screaming compilation?
[09:28.27]What happened?
[09:31.69]What happened?
[09:32.69]What?
[09:33.41]What happened?
[09:35.30]Wait.
[09:46.62]That's goo.
[09:47.88]Oh, okay.
[09:51.86]You can't even touch it?
[09:54.30]I mean, I understand if it goes above the waist, right?
[09:57.17]But I can't even touch this shit.
[10:00.97]Oh, hey, Larry.
[10:03.11]Do you look burned?
[10:03.97]Hmm.
[10:04.11]Hmm.
[10:10.34]What's that mean in French?
[10:13.06]Oh my god, right?
[10:14.37]Oh my gosh?
[10:15.45]That means eat my ass in French.
[10:18.01]No, it doesn't.
[10:18.51]What?
[10:18.67]There's a song.
[10:40.37]Oh, eat my ass.
[10:42.15]What is this?
[10:43.15]How on Earth could I have missed such a sweet little succulent crab?
[10:47.97]What are you talking about?
[10:49.39]That would not be in that show, movie.
[10:55.29]SpongeBob, maybe you can use those sun reflectors to point the sun's rays on that robot.
[11:00.41]Alright, let me pay attention.
[11:01.65]I need to pay attention to the game.
[11:03.19]Maybe you can use the sun reflectors.
[11:10.98]If you hit one of the buttons on the side of a lifeguard tower, the reflector will turn.
[11:15.66]Connect all the towers and the light will shoot right out of the big reflector on the island.
[11:20.34]This is pretty cool.
[11:21.30]Then all you have to do is swim out to the island and turn the big reflector onto the robot.
[11:25.47]Is this real and live?
[11:26.45]Yeah.
[11:28.15]I'll stay here and protect the babes.
[11:31.05]But I can't swim.
[11:32.39]How am I supposed to do this?
[11:36.53]And any of the characters can Sandy swim?
[11:42.33]Alright, where's the first beam?
[11:44.85]Alright, right here.
[11:51.44]First beam going.
[11:56.28]Push, push, push, push, push.
[11:59.90]What are you talking about?
[12:03.32]Push.
[12:10.74]Push.
[12:11.94]Push.
[12:13.66]Who am I pushing?
[12:18.34]No, that's wrong.
[12:18.95]It's gotta go this way.
[12:23.57]Like, push the button.
[12:25.43]Yeah.
[12:25.71]Oh, I thought you meant... I thought you were, like, push the thing out of the way.
[12:29.71]Like, move it.
[12:30.33]Like, turn it.
[12:30.91]Come on.
[12:31.29]I can't make that jump.
[12:37.75]Yes, I can.
[12:42.09]Just jump better.
[12:45.43]I am jumping fine.
[12:46.39]I made it.
[12:46.73]Alright, so which side do I need to press?
[12:52.97]This one?
[12:58.10]No, no, no, no, no!
[13:00.60]Wrong!
[13:01.08]Okay.
[13:08.02]We got one, two, and then we gotta go from here to over there.
[13:10.56]Oh, there's a big, there's a cookie monster over there I can jump on.
[13:16.52]Alright, cool.
[13:19.62]He did it.
[13:21.79]Oh, mega!
[13:26.91]Wrong.
[13:32.61]Across the way?
[13:33.23]There we go, okay.
[13:37.51]But now we go to that one and we gotta move it to over here.
[13:39.61]Imagine if you were at the beach and some pasty dude jumped on your fat belly.
[13:51.60]Alright, this prob- alright.
[13:53.04]This is probably the guy that has like one of those like bad experiences with like a little kid at the beach.
[14:00.18]Where somebody like jumps to dive.
[14:01.65]To pick up like a ball.
[14:04.11]And they just land right on your stomach.
[14:12.59]Alright, which one's missing?
[14:13.61]Am I doing this right?
[14:22.34]What the fuck?
[14:25.50]No, I'm doing it wrong?
[14:27.24]Aren't they all lit up?
[14:36.94]Which one isn't currently being touched?
[14:41.44]This one to here?
[14:48.14]Wait, what does this thing say?
[14:49.26]Why is there a sign here?
[14:51.93]You can get to the... Oh!
[14:53.79]From the pier on the other side of the sea caves.
[14:57.49]Well, shit.
[14:58.15]Can this reach?
[15:10.51]I just woke up.
[15:11.15]Hey, good morning.
[15:13.05]Alright, you can get to the pier from the other side of the sea caves or something.
[15:16.33]Whatever.
[15:16.63]Alright, let's go.
[15:17.25]There's one that's going to be lit across the goo lagoon.
[15:20.74]You won't be able to access it.
[15:23.16]Well, I got those accessed.
[15:24.26]I'm ready to move.
[15:26.78]Somebody screamed because they were just like, Dude, he keeps hitting the fucking lightning tombs.
[15:33.23]Whatever they're called.
[15:39.09]How many spas... It's too early to say that word.
[15:42.53]How many spatulas?
[15:48.36]I gotta be Patrick for this.
[15:49.84]Is there a bus stop?
[15:52.04]I didn't see one.
[15:58.64]Are you a... Are you a... No, I'm not even going to answer that.
[16:03.12]That's like so stupid.
[16:04.56]No.
[16:05.96]Just who cares what character I am from Family Guy.
[16:08.72]I don't care.
[16:09.22]I'm not going to answer that.
[16:12.91]Hey dude, I just want to know.
[16:16.23]Are you a Peter or a Chris from Family Guy?
[16:18.79]Like who cares?
[16:27.35]Who are you?
[16:28.48]What are you?
[16:28.94]That's what I want to know.
[16:30.25]Who are you?
[16:35.14]Oh no, the children's balloons have been overfilled.
[16:38.90]They're carrying the children out of control.
[16:41.34]I don't know, Mrs. Puff.
[16:43.72]It looks like they're having a lot of fun.
[16:46.15]Yes, too much fun if you ask me.
[16:49.95]You can save the children by bubble bashing each of the balloons.
[16:53.39]Okay, we're going to save the kids?
[16:54.35]Bubble bash all the balloons, then come see me.
[16:56.77]Alright, how many?
[16:59.39]What are there?
[17:00.47]Three?
[17:02.55]five alright let's just look up one two three over here this game is fun it just I like this game you know I thought this was a racing game since it came out on like the PlayStation 2. I don't know this is this kind of game
[17:24.58]I didn't even care to look.
[17:27.09]You know why?
[17:27.61]Because most all cartoon licensed video games are car racing games.
[17:35.55]Why is this moving around?
[17:36.33]So it's like a Spongebob battle for Bikini Bottom.
[17:41.94]It's like a combat cartoon Mario Kart racer.
[17:44.40]I don't want to play it.
[17:46.28]I don't know why I didn't give it a chance.
[17:50.78]Hey, there you are.
[17:56.58]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[17:59.02]How wrong you were.
[17:59.98]Yeah, I know.

[19:14.90]Nine.
[19:15.22]One more dirty sock.
[19:17.62]Oh, there's a balloon kid over there.
[19:20.78]Uh, hold on.
[19:27.54]Wait, is the chat in emote only?
[19:28.81]No, it's not.
[19:32.09]Shit, the chat's not in emote only mode.
[19:35.85]Oh no.
[19:37.63]It's just my chat.
[19:41.73]They're not speaking to each other anymore.
[19:43.53]They're just communicating in symbols.
[19:49.97]In images.
[19:50.55]Alright, where is he?
[20:01.38]There's the last two.
[20:02.28]Alright, bounce up here.
[20:03.50]Oh, I got it.
[20:18.55]Everybody, that's why it's so loud.
[20:21.58]Oh, by the way, I saw something the other day, and it was killing me.
[20:31.52]I want to play this.
[20:33.52]And I don't know, am I like a weird narcissist, a weird like sicko, ego maniac for wanting to play this?
[20:39.53]I'll show you the video.
[20:41.11]Hold on, let me just get a spatula.
[20:45.97]I was fucking laughing.
[20:47.03]I was like, why does this exist?
[20:53.39]Somebody made a mod for Dark Messiah of Might and Magic.
[21:00.10]It's my face on the orcs and it's a bunch of random lines from me.
[21:03.68]I was just like, why is this a thing?
[21:14.77]Hold on, here, look.
[21:15.97]Let's watch this.
[21:21.60]Play it now.
[21:22.38]I'm gonna, I'm gonna.
[21:25.80]It's the stupidest fucking thing ever.
[21:29.80]Like, where did you even get all these sound files?
[21:39.10]Hold on, I gotta scroll down and get it.
[21:43.75]Sometimes I peruse the Dremel Reddit and I just check out things that are going on every few weeks or something.
[21:50.94]Here it is.
[21:53.94]Let's watch this together.
[21:56.52]This video only has 700 views.
[21:58.14]What?
[21:58.92]How?
[21:59.78]Unbelievable.

[22:50.62]Whoa!
[22:50.78]Whoa!
[22:51.10]Where'd he go?
[22:55.34]Oh my god, a human!
[22:57.68]Was it trash?
[22:59.26]Oh, whoa!
[23:18.66]Oh my god, I'm human!
[23:30.66]There's a fucking human!
[23:33.66]Get the fuck out of here!
[23:52.63]Oh my god, a human!
[23:55.94]Oh, sorry, Mrs. Puff.
[24:00.80]Oh, I'm a fucking monster.
[24:03.46]Play it, play it.
[24:04.40]I'll play it.
[24:04.94]I will.
[24:08.04]I promise I will at least run around for 20 minutes in this mod.
[24:14.39]Play it now.
[24:15.29]Oh, I can't play it right now.
[24:25.19]Alright, I got a spatula and that- that wasn't even what I was trying to do.
[24:29.31]No, no, I wanna play Spongebob right now.
[24:33.29]I will do that really soon, I promise.
[24:36.65]Beat the game with that mod.
[24:37.93]I already beat- I already beat that whole game.
[24:40.57]And it was a fucking joy.
[24:41.91]I wish I could just delete that from my brain and like play the whole thing again.
[24:56.89]There's a human over there.
[24:58.15]Oh my god, a human!
[25:04.73]Somebody throws ice when I put ice on the ground.
[25:07.33]Oh, somebody puked!
[25:08.77]But I didn't do that.
[25:09.63]That wasn't my gameplay.
[25:11.76]Why am I saying that was me?
[25:14.58]They didn't go in and edit the video of me playing it.
[25:18.24]What am I talking about?
[25:23.72]Can I make it from here?
[25:27.99]She's already puked.
[25:30.57]Okay, I want to go that way.
[25:31.87]Wait, is that like a little... Can I make this jump?
[25:39.90]Shit, I don't think I can.
[25:41.60]No, what have I done?
[25:42.52]God damn it, what have I done?
[25:51.81]You've already been there?
[25:52.53]I want to go across.
[25:54.45]How do I go across?
[25:58.97]Is there no way I can go from here to there?
[26:00.43]Is there like a secret way for me to get to the other side of the lagoon over there?
[26:04.05]Or just go to the right?
[26:10.67]I'll go that way.
[26:14.67]Call Sandy.
[26:15.39]Yeah, I need a bus stop.
[26:16.67]Oh, there's a cookie monster.
[26:28.84]Oh, shit.
[26:30.24]This is a classic Super Mario technique.
[26:34.58]Hey, look at that.
[26:35.46]There we go.
[26:40.39]Ooh, wait a minute.
[26:50.37]Get those.
[26:53.18]Call Sandy.
[26:55.16]Any opportunity I have to play with Sandy, I'm just going to only be Sandy.
[27:00.24]But not yet.
[27:00.74]Let's see what, uh, Bubble Friend says.
[27:01.96]Ooh.
[27:02.08]Oh, Sandy.
[27:02.52]She's crying.
[27:03.04]Oh, Sandy.
[27:03.50]I'm going to.
[27:04.46]Oh, can we talk about the secret patty recipe, by the way, for a quick minute?
[27:27.81]Why is it so hard to figure out?
[27:28.99]Does Plankton not know what a fucking tomato is?
[27:31.41]I don't get it.
[27:35.67]I don't know, SpongeBob.
[27:36.91]What's the secret formula?
[27:38.61]Could it be... It's a tomato and onion and some mayonnaise on it.
[27:42.23]Have you never been to a grocery store, Plankton?
[27:44.88]Oh, fuck.
[27:45.38]Should I not talk about this?
[27:46.94]Um... The golden spatula?
[27:52.88]Oh, at the top of the sandcastle.
[27:54.92]Right.
[27:55.68]That should be easy to reach.
[27:57.63]Ban him.
[27:58.05]Ban him.
[27:58.53]It's a crab patty.
[28:02.43]Wait, it's a crabby patty?
[28:03.91]It's actually made out of crab.
[28:05.99]So you tell me this motherfucker, Mr. Krabs, is running a restaurant where he's grinding up his own fucking people.
[28:12.88]And putting them in between hamburger buns.
[28:16.66]Huh.
[28:17.12]That's kind of weird.
[28:25.53]Am I really late to this joke?
[28:27.09]I feel like I am, right?
[28:28.09]I feel like this somebody's made like a really funny like, oh, Mr. Krabs!
[28:31.15]Can you believe that he makes us out of Krabs?
[28:33.15]I'm like probably 10, 15 years late to this joke.
[28:36.25]Yeah, I'm a little... And the water's rising.
[28:50.22]Now what?
[28:51.30]Now what?
[28:52.54]Now what?
[28:54.62]Now what?
[28:55.40]Oh, it's still going?
[28:57.50]Oh shit, classic Super Mario technique.

[29:14.63]Oh!
[29:21.21]Very cool, checkpoint.
[29:23.54]Hmm.
[29:25.25]Across there?
[29:25.57]Or can I just walk up here and get it?
[29:33.00]Ah, they thought about it.
[29:35.00]They thought about it.
[29:36.00]You can't do it.
[29:40.87]Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding.
[29:57.59]Do you think the guy that made the original ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding gets royalties still?
[30:03.29]Do you think that family has like fucking 25 islands?
[30:06.35]Like I'm the guy and my family's legacy is...
[30:20.36]My great-great-grandmother made the din-din-din-din-din-din-din-din song.
[30:27.00]And it's used in every piece of media.
[30:31.86]Don't fucking do that.
[30:36.92]Do it!
[30:37.50]What's going on?
[30:38.12]Drown!
[30:45.75]You can't copyright a bassline riff.
[31:00.10]But there are whole songs made about this.
[31:02.40]You can.
[31:03.24]Yo, you can.
[31:03.90]Alright, do you think that the guy that first made this song with, like, a guitar on the beach, do you think he, like, wowed the fuck out of everybody back in, like, the 40s?
[31:17.67]Imagine hearing this for the first time.
[31:19.99]Like, a guy with a guitar on the beach, and he's just like, oh, let me, let me, hold on a second.
[31:25.70]Holy shit, I got something big.
[31:29.62]Play that one again!
[31:30.30]Alright, this is how I'm gonna be fuckin' rich!
[31:36.94]Hold on, keep going!
[31:37.80]And they come up with a couple of cans.

[31:44.71]Oh my god, my- I'm gonna create generational wealth!
[31:49.69]Okay, cool.

[32:33.88]There's a fish in the water that pops up and goes like, boom!
[32:36.40]And does the dab and goes back in the water.
[32:37.98]Okay.
[32:40.99]It's probably like all over Reddit right now.
[32:42.73]I don't care.
[32:43.45]I don't have to see it.
[32:51.91]What should you get for lunch?
[32:54.52]I don't know.
[32:57.76]Something cheese related.
[32:58.66]You'll figure it out.
[33:01.96]Ooh, there's a spatula at the end of this cave.
[33:07.92]I made that.
[33:12.42]The game's controls are fucked up.
[33:16.57]Yeah, I don't know, something, that fucking jump sticks all the time.
[33:19.39]Fucking, what the fuck?
[33:21.57]Yeah, the jump's sticking right now.

[33:37.37]It's a fucking miracle I'm able to do this.
[33:38.79]Fucking game.
[33:45.18]Oh shit.

[33:57.76]Should I go this way, or... Ooh, there's a few ways to go.
[34:01.02]Alright, we're gonna go... No, we're not.
[34:03.34]We're gonna go... What happened?
[34:09.05]Did I die from hitting my head on the top?
[34:12.17]Did I give myself a concussion?
[34:13.73]What the fuck was that?
[34:21.51]Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[34:35.51]Oooh, there's a secret up there. Alright I'm gonna come back that way.

[34:55.51]Alright easy - don't fuck it up.
[35:02.91]He's lying.
[35:03.81]He's not feeling okay.
[35:05.97]It's a lie.
[35:11.38]Oh, there's the spatula right there.
[35:13.02]I need to drop that stalactite.
[35:15.64]It's stalactite because it hangs from the ceiling.
[35:17.38]Stalagmites are the ones that grow from the ground.
[35:19.34]Tight like it has to stick on the ceiling.
[35:21.06]You get it?
[35:23.98]Oh shit.
[35:39.63]Do a colonoscopy stream.
[35:41.09]I'm not going to do a colonoscopy stream.
[35:44.35]Isn't that how invasive that is?
[35:48.98]No, that's incredibly invasive.
[35:58.44]Alright, so there we go.
[36:03.46]wrap that around no although I wonder if like educationally yeah I could do that on Twitch
[36:30.15]And just, and put, very specifically, put like bird documentary music in the background.
[36:47.63]No, 100% no.
[36:48.33]You sure?
[36:52.41]No, what do I mean you sure?
[36:54.25]No, I'm sure about not doing that.
[36:57.67]Alright, I got it.
[36:58.41]Did I miss any secret spatulas?
[37:06.09]Wait, I wanted to do that part over there.
[37:09.40]It's just a classic collect-a-thon.
[37:12.90]Plagiarizing what somebody said yesterday, the day before.
[37:16.14]Two days ago.
[37:16.66]No, three days.
[37:17.12]It was four days ago.
[37:19.35]Up there.
[37:19.87]Alright, how do I get up there?

[37:42.70]Oh, I need Patrick to freeze.
[37:49.92]Oh, well.
[37:50.86]Damn it.
[37:55.45]There's a bus stop outside.
[37:56.75]I can come back in here.
[37:57.53]There's two socks in here that Patrick can get.
[38:02.40]Karma, be funny.
[38:03.18]Alright.

[38:25.27]Right, guys?
[38:40.05]I missed the first box.
[38:42.07]Well, that's alright.
[38:42.65]I don't have to get every single item.
[38:46.51]Ooh.
[38:51.15]Alright, wait, there's a bus stop right here.
[38:52.41]Alright, I'm gonna do Patrick.
[38:58.33]Wait, do I have to be Patrick?
[39:00.84]Or can I be Sandy?
[39:03.58]Wait, I can't be Sandy?
[39:07.90]Why not?
[39:11.83]It's different every level.
[39:16.28]Oh wait, do I get to play as like Squidward?
[39:18.02]Is it a spatula?
[39:19.28]It is a spatula, me boy.

[40:02.63]Oh, now we've really started the encounter.
[40:05.55]Oh, boy.
[40:10.73]Now we've really started the encounter.
[40:27.23]How many, um... How many Crunch Berries do I need?
[40:34.30]For Mr. Krabs?
[40:39.22]3,000?
[40:48.11]Yes, I'm getting all the green ones.
[40:49.39]They're worth five each.
[40:59.81]Alright, what are we throwing this?
[41:01.51]Ooh, whack-a-tiki.
[41:05.24]Oh, shit.
[41:05.66]Alright, let's go.
[41:10.10]Oh!
[41:13.04]Wait, cheat, cheat, cheat!
[41:19.94]Cheat!
[41:31.08]What?
[41:32.92]What, like, somebody's gonna see me walk over to the skee-ball machine and walk over gently to the left of the machine and slowly place the skee-ball into the 100 ten times in a row?
[41:46.83]Am I gonna get in trouble for that?
[41:49.79]Wait, can I do this over and over again?
[41:58.45]Wow!
[42:02.37]I'm telling the Chuck E. Cheese manager, well, you can't because they're bankrupt.
[42:05.91]That's rude.
[42:06.95]I love that place.
[42:07.63]I, like, genuinely liked that place a lot when I was younger.
[42:16.84]What's that?
[42:22.22]That place was great.
[42:22.98]There was, like, pizza and shit.
[42:24.30]Like, why?
[42:25.98]What the fuck?
[42:27.18]It's horrible.
[42:29.61]You got to eat pizza and hang out with your friends...
[42:34.74]It was so much fun.
[42:42.10]Half the machines didn't work.
[42:50.68]The dollar bill machine to get money somehow used Canadian for some reason.
[42:54.70]Nobody figured out why.
[43:00.94]Joystick was missing from five of the machines.
[43:07.21]How do I turn this off?
[43:14.46]Wait, we can just ride it?
[43:21.88]You know what I bet's worth a lot of money?
[43:23.12]I bet you some... I bet you some of those Five Nights at Freddy's tokens are fucking worth a lot of money.
[43:37.37]Chuck E. Cheese token.
[43:38.95]Yes.
[43:39.35]This is probably like a secret where if I stay in here long enough.
[43:47.07]Is there like a break one or ride one or go down like a Mario pipe or anything?
[43:55.79]Chuck E. Cheese has more subscribers than you.
[44:02.35]Uh, yeah, there were also like a multi-million dollar conglomerate that had like entertainment capitals all over the fucking cities.
[44:11.78]Yeah, sorry, I got less subscribers than a multimedia conglomerate.
[44:16.80]With like 15,000 fucking people that have worked for that company.
[44:24.12]Oh!
[44:25.34]I found skeeble!
[44:27.32]Spongebob, I found skeeble!
[44:32.64]SpongeBob needs the Bubble Bowl.
[44:34.00]Wait, I can't just walk up?
[44:46.18]Go on!
[44:47.16]No!
[44:48.68]Get off me!
[44:50.52]I don't have the Bubble Bowl.
[44:51.82]I'm Patrick.
[44:53.06]Patrick doesn't have the Bubble Bowl.
[44:54.46]SpongeBob has the Bubble Bowl.
[44:55.80]But stop!
[45:04.69]Oh, yes.
[45:05.34]Okay.
[45:13.50]Okay, what is considered illegal?
[45:15.48]Alright.
[45:16.60]I can stand right at the top left arrow.
[45:28.95]I fell.
[45:29.35]That doesn't count.
[45:34.36]It's actual balls.
[45:38.69]Come on.
[45:44.97]Come on.
[45:52.28]Come on.
[45:54.32]Can I get one point?
[46:05.01]Don't do the thing that happens all the time where you roll it, and it bounces off the back and rolls back.
[46:10.92]And then you have to do the stupid embarrassing thing where you go, Oops!
[46:13.60]Sorry!
[46:14.02]Sorry!
[46:14.48]Sorry!
[46:14.86]Sorry!
[46:16.02]And it like rolls down the fucking entire arcade.
[46:19.89]Sorry!
[46:20.53]I'm sorry.
[46:21.03]It just bounced back on me.
[46:49.50]He's pretending.
[46:50.82]Do I look like I'm pretending?
[46:54.54]I'm trying to get it in there.
[46:56.09]What's that?
[47:18.17]He had to end there.
[47:33.74]How did it go backwards?
[47:34.84]How did I throw it backwards?
[47:36.46]Okay, I did it.
[47:44.21]Where's my prize?
[47:53.55]What am I- what's the deal here?
[47:55.67]I need 50?
[47:57.99]Can I just get 50?
[48:22.67]How many points do I need?
[48:32.41]I have to get four in a row?
[48:47.22]Why did the game just lag?
[48:49.04]Like I was connecting.
[48:53.54]No, I wasn't pretending.
[48:54.38]I was trying to get super points.
[48:55.53]Do I maybe get it in each one?
[49:03.63]We just got invaded.
[49:04.89]You're gonna stop.
[49:18.30]What?
[49:24.80]Do I not get a spatula from this or something cool?
[49:31.63]Stop.
[49:32.05]Slow down.
[49:32.65]I got it.
[49:34.01]Okay, now I'm just going to get the one in the middle.
[49:44.40]Right there.
[49:46.56]Stop it.
[49:48.24]Stop this act.
[49:50.85]Is that... What act?
[49:52.13]I'm not acting.
[49:53.18]I'm trying to play skee-ball.
[49:59.07]Try harder.
[50:00.17]Alright.
[50:00.85]I got them all.
[50:04.13]Wait. 4877.
[50:22.96]You're the best actor at cheating at a kid's game.
[50:26.57]Imagine putting that on my acting resume.
[50:34.97]It says here that you were in the background in a McDonald's commercial.
[50:38.23]Okay, cool.
[50:41.61]You're a guy that sneezes.
[50:47.08]In this doctor's show.
[50:50.62]Okay, cool.
[50:51.81]It also says here, really good at pretending to play video games on Twitch and be bad at them.
[50:57.95]Oh, show me.
[51:00.75]Let's act.
[51:01.59]Show me.
[51:06.02]I hover with my hands in the air.
[51:11.84]Oh, no.
[51:13.72]Oh, shit.
[51:15.30]Guys, I'm sorry.
[51:16.52]Oh, more.
[51:19.28]Oh, I fell off again.
[51:20.30]Oops.
[51:20.66]Oh, no, I fell off and died.
[51:22.26]This is the best acting I've ever seen.
[51:28.70]Hey, guys, I can't see it.
[51:30.36]I can't see where it is.
[51:31.20]Where is it?
[51:31.86]Why are you guys saying blind?
[51:32.92]Ha, ha, ha.
[51:34.84]Oh, you think it's a Batman meme?
[51:36.71]I'm doing that.
[51:37.27]I'm going backwards.
[51:40.35]Can I get this?
[51:59.98]Oh, the acting.
[52:01.08]Oh, magnificent.
[52:06.15]The way that he pretended to look down at the water.
[52:09.67]The way that he thought he could grab the spatula.
[52:13.09]Oh, I'm such a fan.
[52:17.81]Wait, what's this?
[52:35.52]You can go even higher.
[52:37.04]Wait, there's a... Uh-huh.
[52:42.05]Wait, wait, wait.
[52:42.71]Hey, hey, hey.
[52:43.67]Oh, no.
[52:44.19]He pulled away and he caressed and grabbed gently and onto the hook like he thought he could grab it.
[52:52.45]Oh, it's just... It's immaculate.
[53:01.04]Patrick can't grab that?
[53:22.92]What's this for?
[53:24.00]This is going down.
[53:24.80]Why is this going down?
[53:26.64]Why is this going down?
[53:27.92]Why is this going down?
[53:29.39]Am I too heavy?
[53:35.27]It's supposed to go down?
[53:41.35]Oh.
[53:44.51]I gotta... Am I too fat?
[53:45.69]I gotta be Patrick.
[53:46.94]No, I gotta be... Alright, let me go be Spongebob.
[53:49.16]I'm gonna get the spatula.
[53:51.04]It's right there.
[53:55.85]I don't know why I thought I could jump on that.
[53:57.44]I don't know why.
[53:58.04]I'm not gonna... I thought I could like jump on that and then jump off of it.
[54:10.98]Oscar.
[54:12.04]Imagine getting an Oscar.
[54:16.18]And the nominees for Best Actor in a Lead Role are... Daniel Day-Lewis for Abraham Lincoln.
[54:27.62]Steve Buscemi for Ronald Reagan.
[54:37.46]Jeremy Elbertson for Guy Pretending at Children's Game.
[54:45.38]Only three this year.
[54:47.56]Wait, I want to grab that.
[54:54.03]Where'd he experience?
[54:57.34]And the winner, the Oscar goes to, and I'm just sitting there holding the fucking seat like, oh my god!
[55:04.78]Who is it gonna be?
[55:08.16]Steve Buscemi for Ronald Reagan, and I'm just like, ah!
[55:13.30]This is the 12th time that, and he's walking up, and I'm just like, fuck, goddammit.
[55:19.06]He goes to like Shay.
[55:20.06]Oh, hey, like, yeah, like what you were, what a category here.
[55:23.46]And I'm just like, I fucking put my hand in the air and I scoffed the other way.
[55:26.36]And I like, fuck out of here.
[55:36.91]How am I supposed to actually just bounce on this?
[55:41.09]This is my first Sterma stream.
[55:44.68]Hey.
[55:46.38]Welcome to the stream.
[55:49.16]You know, I like to think we do things differently here.
[55:58.56]Can I stand on this?
[56:04.11]I gotta be Patrick for this.
[56:05.41]Why can't I just change on the fly?
[56:06.71]Where's the GTA hold down on the D-pad?
[56:09.43]I didn't have to get on a bus stop when I was playing as Michael.
[56:29.03]Alright, now I'm gonna be Patrick.
[56:34.95]That's a journalist complaint?
[56:38.67]No, it isn't.
[56:39.09]It's a regular complaint.
[56:41.67]A journalist complaint is just a complaint.
[56:44.62]It's still just complaints.
[56:46.70]So, I gotta go like this and then throw this.
[56:50.08]Don't get hit by anything, right?
[56:51.38]That's the part of this, this, this, this interesting puzzle.
[56:59.69]Only a sock for that one?
[57:02.13]I think that's worth more than a sock.
[57:11.02]Hey.
[57:12.04]Check that out.
[57:13.12]Bachelor.
[57:13.56]12 o'clock.
[57:14.72]This thing pushed me.
[57:36.84]"Where are you gonna do a facecam?"
[57:37.34]Wait, look at that!
[57:37.74]How is it gonna get down there?
[57:38.62]Shit, okay.

[58:24.08]Knockout.
[58:39.82]Where am I going?
[58:41.30]Oh, wait.
[58:41.68]Go back. Go back. Go back. Go back. Go back. Go back.
[58:45.85]I wasn't looking.
[58:46.51]Two.
[58:48.85]Is it on zero?
[58:49.65]Oh, fuck.
[58:50.07]It's on zero.
[58:50.59]I thought it was on... I thought it was going to be one, zero, not on zero, like one more.
[58:56.25]You know what I mean?
[58:59.38]Alright.
[58:59.62]I got what I wanted.
[59:14.28]Oh, is this supposed to be bumper cars?
[59:23.71]Alright, I'll crush them.
[59:26.35]Why have I lost this much health?
[59:31.77]Bumper boats cleared?
[59:35.49]So?
[59:37.36]So what?
[59:42.94]Oh, there's a Patrick Jumper over there.
[59:44.84]Supposed to clear all the stuff with robots.
[59:47.38]Oh.
[59:47.44]Look at you.
[59:51.50]Wait, what?
[60:17.84]Oh, shit.
[60:18.36]Okay, this is the... Ah!
[60:25.92]You lost progress?
[60:29.20]I didn't.
[60:30.12]I'm about to get it right here.
[60:30.98]Look it.
[60:31.18]I have to be Spongebob, though.
[60:42.02]Your save got wiped.
[60:45.34]Quiet.
[60:46.26]Quiet!
[60:55.00]Alright.
[60:56.94]Did it.
[61:03.24]Now I go back and Mr. Krabs gives me a spatula, right?
[61:07.77]But should I not do that?
[61:09.87]I should go back and do the rest of the other stuff over there, right?
[61:15.43]Hold on, I gotta sneeze.
[61:17.71]Oh no, it's not gonna happen, is it?
[61:23.00]I couldn't say.
[61:23.52]I couldn't do it.
[61:24.16]I tried to hit the button.
[61:26.80]Sorry.
[61:34.41]My stream deck is fucked up.
[61:37.37]Sometimes I'll press one of the buttons and it won't do anything, and then it'll do it like two or three presses later.
[61:46.95]Oh, wait.
[61:47.27]This is how you're supposed to do this part.
[62:15.52]Yeah.
[62:18.83]What's he doing?
[62:19.39]I saw the green, so I wanted to go get it.
[62:29.11]Patrick can do some shit over here, right?
[62:31.09]That I couldn't do before.
[62:34.96]What can Patrick do over here?
[62:45.33]Bless you?
[62:45.73]Hey, thanks!
[62:48.30]The only person that said that.

[64:24.20]Fuck!
[64:25.52]Damn it!
[64:26.08]I'm so pissed off right now.
[64:27.96]I thought I had more than... I was just gonna tank the hits because I figured I had more health.
[64:40.03]That's a lot of, uh... Crunchies.
[64:46.55]I don't even... Whatever.
[64:48.72]Lambs.
[64:49.22]I don't know what to call them.
[64:53.07]Okay, here we go.
[64:56.17]Did I get it?
[64:57.43]I got it.
[64:59.23]Alright, let's get out of here.
[65:06.09]You already lost the Oscar.
[65:07.39]Stop.
[65:15.15]You missed the spatula.
[65:16.41]Go back to Larry.
[65:18.85]Yeah, I know, I know.
[65:19.71]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[65:23.29]Larry has a spatula for me.
[65:24.81]It's just waiting for me to come get.
[65:28.32]I thought I could make it.
[65:29.30]Whatever, just go to the beginning.
[65:30.68]Rewind to Larry.
[65:31.42]I know, I know, I know.
[65:32.22]Let's start to see how many spatulas are in an area.
[65:39.31]Ooh, there's only one more.
[65:42.31]Connect the towers.
[65:43.01]There's one secret spatula that I have.
[65:45.09]What's wrong with my voice?
[65:57.47]Just warp to it.
[65:58.27]Dude!
[66:05.10]Hey, Larry.
[66:11.92]Connected all the towers, and now I did everything in Goo Lagoon.
[66:18.20]Goo Lagoon has been complete, except for this one.
[66:21.53]I don't know what it is.
[66:23.71]But, you know, I'll take a majority of those.
[66:31.82]Alright, what's next on the list?
[66:33.39]I like this.
[66:37.35]Alright, let's get out of here.
[66:45.37]Let's go back to Bikini Bottom.
[66:47.19]There's still three spatulas I have not gotten in Bikini Bottom.
[66:51.50]I'm not going to 100% this.
[66:54.62]No.
[66:54.78]Is this a CBD stream?
[67:00.82]No.
[67:05.42]No, it's not.
[67:05.98]Wait, there's a spatula up there.
[67:06.94]Can I get up there?
[67:07.89]It's 40.
[67:08.09]I got 40!
[67:08.39]Oh, I don't have 40.
[67:10.41]What do I have?
[67:10.75]38?

[68:37.96]There's candy here.
[68:38.76]Huh?
[68:41.24]What was that all about?
[68:44.90]Thought that was an enemy.
[68:55.21]Nope.
[68:55.31]Stab him in the back.
[69:09.82]Lookin' bad.
[69:25.93]What happens when you die?
[69:27.69]Like, okay, imagine like just being asleep and die.

[70:01.13]These platforms will collapse unless spongebob sneaks across them very carefully Got it
[70:17.23]I got lots of these.
[70:18.13]I should probably spend them.
[70:21.04]Yeah, there's a stealth level.
[70:22.22]I don't know about this one.
[70:27.78]I don't know about this level.
[70:28.92]I don't like sneaky stealth levels.
[70:34.89]We'll see if it changes my mind.
[70:36.13]Okay, here we go.
[71:03.03]This little scared the fuck out of me when I was a kid.
[71:06.59]Did it?
[71:07.43]Why?
[71:07.75]I know why.
[71:09.15]Because of the big scary robot that you have to sneak by.
[71:11.93]I get it.
[71:12.31]How do I get that?
[71:15.42]Can I jump?
[71:22.74]Yes.
[71:28.20]Doesn't mean you live.
[71:28.92]I know how it works.
[71:31.28]Let's go.
[71:40.19]SpongeBob the robots are plundering rock bottoms museum, but they've broken the roadway leading up there You'll have to be clever and find another route to get in.
[71:49.65]What if I lick all these stamps and mail myself?
[71:52.79]Good work, but perhaps being sneaky would Oh Spongebob that'll never work.
[71:58.88]I don't never work.
[72:00.98]You'll suffocate in the box.
[72:02.36]Oh
[72:16.06]Attack point.
[72:21.18]Oh wait, okay.
[72:24.12]Okay, does it matter if I don't sneak here?
[72:25.74]Can I just kill him?
[72:26.74]I just walk by him and hit him.
[72:28.86]Does he activate a shield or something if I don't?
[72:33.92]What?
[72:35.30]Alright, up.
[72:38.60]Ooh, special over here.
[72:47.96]Get away from me.

[74:16.93]You're not you.
[74:18.93]Is that what you mean by that?
[74:20.45]I know you didn't say that, but I feel like that's what you meant.
[74:23.87]Who am I then?
[74:28.65]What would you classify me as?
[74:41.94]Alright, we got more of these.
[74:46.16]You're Dean Dingus.
[74:48.14]You're short.
[74:55.80]Let me tell you something.
[74:56.72]I can't wait to go to TwitchCon like next year.
[74:59.66]I'm gonna have like 5 inch inserts and I'm gonna be like 6 feet tall.
[75:05.22]I'm gonna fuck with all of you.
[75:19.36]I need to get the bus stop.
[75:26.05]Anybody see a bus stop anywhere for me to pull up to?
[75:30.07]Sandy?
[75:30.47]I'll just add the character we're going to call.
[75:36.02]Did you break your back by trying to be taller?
[75:38.12]I would say ban that person, but okay.
[75:44.08]Let him.
[75:45.22]Let him have it.
[75:57.18]No, no, not punching.
[75:58.68]No, stop.
[76:01.53]It's not what I meant.
[76:04.81]Punching.
[76:06.07]I love opening presents.
[76:07.53]Whoa!
[76:08.57]Okay, now I know what happens if you get spotted.
[76:15.04]There's purple in there.
[76:22.22]I feel like a new sponge.
[76:34.22]Ah!
[76:36.28]Okay, so can I... What does this do?
[76:38.56]Where does this go?
[76:40.72]This goes back... Okay, that was dumb.
[76:44.93]This goes back here.
[76:45.77]So now I can go this way.
[76:55.19]Press this button.
[76:57.76]And what does that do?
[76:59.50]Oh, I activated another button!
[77:05.80]There it is!
[77:20.26]Oh shit, do I need to keep going fast?
[77:24.12]Oops.
[77:24.40]Could I have been the ball still?
[77:33.29]Are there safes down here?
[77:36.41]What is this bullshit?
[77:38.53]Okay, we're going up, up, up.
[77:54.22]Ooh.
[77:55.52]Cannon destroyed.
[77:56.82]Now what?
[77:58.52]What did that do for me?
[78:04.60]Just got rid of the cannon Can I make this?
[78:17.13]Okay, I can I didn't think I could make that Can I go up?
[78:31.79]Why though?
[78:32.29]Why though?
[78:32.75]Why though?
[78:33.23]Why?
[78:34.09]Oh, right.
[78:34.67]I forgot he could do this.
[78:35.59]Guys, it's been like three days.
[78:36.83]I forgot Spongebob had that ability.
[78:40.41]It's Andy time.
[78:48.20]Don't say anything.
[78:48.90]Let him figure it out.
[78:49.76]No, help me.
[78:50.32]I think I could probably do it.
[78:56.28]No.
[79:03.76]Alright, so this is gonna go to where I'm gonna have to jump from here to here.
[79:06.98]And then fight!
[79:15.29]Fight!
[79:16.07]Okay.
[79:18.43]Holy shit, Sandy, you almost just blew it.
[79:32.40]Okay.
[79:33.48]Then we go... Ooh, butt.
[79:40.73]Nice.
[79:42.07]Spatula over there, too.
[79:43.05]Oh, wait.
[79:44.99]Oh, look at that.
[79:45.69]Okay.
[79:46.81]Um... Alright, one thing at a... One thing at a time.
[79:50.55]What do I do first?
[79:52.29]I'm gonna do... I feel bad at stuff like this because I have, like, three or four places to go that all make sense.
[80:02.50]I want to go over there.
[80:03.32]Okay.
[80:03.64]I'm just going to go this way.
[80:11.01]To get the one that I know I need to get.
[80:12.59]Where he said, no, no, no.
[80:21.47]Wait.
[80:23.71]Andy can't.
[80:29.31]I can't.
[80:29.73]Wait.
[80:30.33]Here we go.
[80:39.16]Look what you've done?
[80:40.18]You mean get the puzzle piece?
[80:53.19]Ooh, travel to the museum.
[80:54.65]Oh, alright.
[80:55.89]No, no, no, no, no.
[80:56.81]Not traveling to the museum.
[80:58.83]I'm going to go do the other Sandy-related tasks.
[81:12.62]What else can I do with Sandy?
[81:17.59]Get some of the paintings.
[81:20.31]There we are.
[81:28.02]I didn't want to do that, but I guess I'm here.
[81:31.65]Wait.
[81:32.21]This is going to work out.
[81:33.30]Check this out.
[81:33.74]Ready?
[81:35.08]This will work out.
[81:36.80]Alright.
[81:37.04]This spatula is over there.
[81:39.20]So, theoretically... Now, this is just a theory of mine.
[81:43.79]I'm going to go up high.
[81:44.75]Double jump.
[81:48.41]I fucked it up.
[81:48.95]Hold on.
[82:03.80]You can't do it forever!
[82:04.46]Okay, you can't do it forever.
[82:05.38]I got it.
[82:22.10]What?
[82:38.11]You're cheating, that's why.
[82:40.01]Hold on.
[82:40.33]Wait, just one fucking second.
[82:49.22]I can't jump on.
[82:50.06]Fuck it.
[82:50.50]Fuck it.
[82:50.96]Fuck it.
[82:51.24]Alright, done.
[82:51.82]Just get me back up there and I'm gonna go... Hold on.
[82:57.89]I need to press a button?
[82:58.87]Alright, so what's this for?
[83:02.37]To get over there?
[83:05.58]What's the practical use of this?
[83:07.22]Well, I mean, nothing's as good as Texas barbecue sauce, so that's kind of unfair.
[83:27.35]Go up here again.
[83:29.17]Can I get it?
[83:31.83]Whoa!
[83:42.25]Do I just have to keep going?
[83:44.25]Hold on.
[83:46.69]Return to the museum's art.
[83:47.79]Get to the museum.
[83:48.93]Go in the museum.
[83:49.79]I'm just going to go in the museum, I guess.
[83:51.73]I'm taking too much time running around looking at stuff.
[83:58.67]I'm just going to the museum.
[83:59.55]Stop.
[84:06.31]Stop.
[84:10.88]What?
[84:11.82]I'm going to the museum.
[84:16.54]I'm going to the museum.
[84:21.98]As Sandy.
[84:22.69]Let's go.
[84:23.07]Could go on that.
[84:30.51]I could go on that.
[84:32.93]Nope.
[84:43.35]This looks tricky.
[84:43.99]Wait, do I have to activate this with SpongeBob?
[84:47.61]I'm pronouncing it wrong.
[84:48.57]It's SpongeBob.
[85:12.59]Did I deactivate it?
[85:23.89]Go back.
[85:24.37]Activate it.
[85:39.77]Activate the quest No, this is my second job I work see now listen if you want to reach the golden spatula you need to shut off the museum security system and
[85:54.21]Shady Shoals will shut down.
[85:54.91]Hmm.
[85:55.07]Hmm.
[86:23.19]Don't you guys feel like this is what Popeye and Olive Oil's kid would look like?
[86:26.39]Do they have a half a kid?
[86:39.81]They did.
[86:40.33]No, they didn't.
[86:44.87]Who is Popeye?
[86:45.83]You don't know who Popeye is?
[86:48.81]What?
[86:58.09]Guys, I'll give you some help.
[86:59.48]They use the same soundtrack in SpongeBob that they do in Popeye.
[87:04.98]Same theme.
[87:06.00]Nautical theme.
[87:16.73]Why are you saying... What do you mean... Popeye.
[87:21.13]Popeye?
[87:23.01]What am I saying?
[87:23.83]Popeye.

[87:25.37]Popeye!
[87:31.35]Alright, guys, when like a British person says like Popeye, it's not like, oh, he said pop.
[87:39.15]Did you hear that?

[93:57.43]Jeremy's wicked fucking ugly.
[93:58.83]Put that as an emote.

[94:59.45]By the way, if you want to know what's on tap for tomorrow, I've got the PlayStation 3 2012 Olympic Games, the video game.
[95:10.82]Quite interesting.
[95:15.39]If I do not complete SpongeBob, we will finish it.
[95:18.47]And we'll move on to the Olympics.
[95:25.40]To say that was not a hard jump, how would I have missed that?
[95:27.76]I don't know.
[95:30.42]I'm still angry.
[95:31.64]It's alright.
[95:32.26]Just... Don't... Just stop being... I told you not to be angry with me.
[95:41.10]You're a liar.
[95:43.72]Lying about the Olympics or lying about that I'll finish Spongebob?
[95:49.11]I'll get there by the end of the day.
[95:51.29]Tomorrow, today, I don't know, whatever.
[95:58.88]I gotta get up there quick because I gotta jump.
[96:01.06]Don't ruin this for me.
[96:01.86]This guy's ruining this for me.
[96:05.08]He ruined it.
[96:05.68]That guy ruined it for me.
[96:06.90]I can't get up there now.
[96:08.22]Yes, I can.
[96:10.76]I feel like a new sponge.
[96:21.55]Use the bubble bowl.
[96:25.97]Guys, remember, if it does... Oh!
[96:33.03]That was pretty... That was the most accidental... Accidental pog.
[96:38.67]No!
[96:41.90]All the way at the beginning.
[96:45.82]Wait, I can go in here.
[96:58.42]That was equivalent exchange.
[97:02.14]Equivalent exchange for every action, there must be an equal opposite reaction.
[97:27.08]What about behind me?
[97:32.02]That's Newton's third law.
[97:33.42]That's not alchemy.
[97:36.24]The same fucking thing.
[97:40.54]Yeah, Newton smashed a piece of iron into his head over and over again and he thought it was gonna make gold out of it and like breathed on it or something.
[97:49.05]Whatever his law was.
[97:58.12]They were all fucking alchemists.
[97:59.34]They all like were trying to turn iron into gold and they all, yeah, look at what I can do.
[98:04.02]They painted iron yellow and shit and sold it to people.
[98:06.93]See, I did that.
[98:10.65]Slamming fucking homemade whiskey out of a fucking jar.
[98:19.44]I need Sandy now.
[98:33.23]I was looking at chat.
[98:37.53]I was even looking.
[98:38.73]I didn't think we were going to be on a slide.
[98:42.70]Wait, I want to be Sandy.
[98:47.60]How am I going to get that up there?
[98:49.04]I don't want to do this.
[98:59.41]Alright, I'm not going to go for any skips.
[99:01.13]Just go for... Can I go backwards and go in there again?
[99:04.75]No.
[99:06.07]Just get the... Alright, I'm done.
[99:08.03]Just do the slide.
[99:08.95]Don't do anything stupid.
[99:09.85]Don't make any jumps or anything.
[99:12.02]That was tight.
[99:19.02]I feel like a new sponge.
[99:23.78]Hey, Gary.
[99:26.86]You're on an awful long walk, aren't you?
[99:32.93]That's an interstellar joke.
[99:34.27]I don't know what that means.
[99:36.57]The trench of advanced darkness, huh?
[99:39.85]Sounds dark.
[99:41.51]Okay, Gary.
[99:42.45]I'll be extra, extra, extra careful.
[99:46.83]Meow.
[99:49.10]Hey, Gary.
[99:50.38]What do you say we go for an adventure?
[99:53.12]Meow.
[99:54.56]Meow.
[100:06.42]I'll stop.
[100:16.31]Can I go backwards now?
[100:26.26]Can I go up the slide and go back?
[100:36.73]Let me do the fucking dumb thing I want to do.
[100:54.11]Anybody feel like I'm doing that thing in Mario Kart when you know you're in last place and you got lapped already and you turn around to go the wrong way to just drive into people in first place because you're just fucking salty?
[101:13.60]This should be a thing.
[101:15.49]Like, Lakitu should come over and just be like, alright, cut the shit after like 30 seconds.
[101:26.09]If you have a wrong way thing on your screen for more than 10 seconds, you shouldn't be able to... Hold on.
[101:31.99]Alright, we'll just... Now we can do it as Sandy.
[101:37.72]Oh!
[101:37.88]I mistimed it.
[101:39.34]I'm gonna be Spongebob.
[101:42.52]Oh, what the hell.
[101:43.82]All that time.
[101:44.82]Gone.
[101:45.34]It was all that time.
[101:46.68]Gone.
[101:47.62]All that time.
[101:48.28]The precious time.
[101:52.61]Why are you pronouncing it wrong?
[101:55.26]His name is Lakitu.
[101:56.48]How am I saying it wrong?
[101:59.94]Lakitu?
[102:01.18]Lakitu?
[102:02.58]What is it?
[102:04.32]This game's fucking too loud for me.
[102:13.74]Lakitu?
[102:14.30]No, it's Lakitu.
[102:15.58]Lakitu.
[102:28.33]Locket 2?
[102:31.77]Is it?
[102:32.09]No, it's not.
[102:32.59]It's Lakitu.
[102:33.45]Lakitu.
[102:35.25]Do I actually have to be Spongebob?
[102:41.21]Why even give me the opportunity to change?
[102:42.59]Well, I don't know, but I'm...
[102:58.90]I'm in trouble here.
[103:06.49]I can't be Spongebob.
[103:13.77]Texas barbecue.
[103:16.48]Yep.
[103:18.32]I love that stuff.
[103:23.52]Is the bus stopped?
[103:25.39]Where's the bus stop?
[103:26.57]I passed it.
[103:27.83]Oh, he's so fucking stupid.
[103:31.25]I'm gonna go.
[103:32.11]I'll be back in like 20 minutes.
[103:38.64]I gotta get up.
[103:39.12]I gotta get up.
[103:39.52]I can't watch him do it anymore.
[103:40.76]I'll be back.
[103:41.72]God damn it, Jeremy.
[103:43.82]I'll be back.
[103:51.49]Roll, roll, roll the sponge.
[104:01.29]Watch out!
[104:03.39]Sneaky.
[104:06.41]Leave.
[104:07.09]Punch, punch, leave.
[104:08.67]Punch, punch.
[104:10.15]You better not punch me that much.
[104:11.70]Okay, 2400.
[104:12.18]I love opening presents.
[104:29.47]Bungie is gonna be, uh... Where is it?
[104:34.21]Oh, heck.
[104:35.03]It was just a sock?
[104:36.11]Fucking livid.
[104:55.70]Just a sock.
[104:57.42]But that was over $2,000 for a sock.
[105:02.26]Nope.
[105:04.04]I would say that's not worth it.
[105:06.55]Hey, SpongeBob.
[105:08.55]SpongeBob, I command you to bring Sandy to me for this next job.
[105:15.35]I can do that.
[105:21.31]What's that?
[105:24.13]Wait.
[105:26.05]Can I get up there?
[105:28.09]How do I get up there?
[105:34.44]You go up.
[105:45.71]Yeah, but how?
[105:48.13]Plankton, you best not be stirring up no trouble.
[105:55.04]Nonsense.
[105:55.96]I only want to help.
[105:57.72]Help crush you all under my rise to power.
[106:01.26]What was that?
[106:02.92]Nothing.
[106:04.06]Say, see those lasers there?
[106:06.56]You mean them things that look like fancy washing machines?
[106:11.16]To your puny brain, I suppose.
[106:13.94]You'll need to turn on each one of those in order to cross the last part of the Trench of Advanced Darkness.
[106:20.66]This better not be some kind of trick, Vermit.
[106:25.38]Okay.
[106:26.50]I'll try.
[106:27.80]Look at me!
[106:39.83]Ooh.
[106:40.47]Oh!
[106:41.03]Oh!
[106:42.07]Oh!
[106:44.25]I got it.
[106:46.69]I got it.
[106:47.37]I got it.
[106:47.71]I think I got it.
[106:49.47]Calm down, okay?
[106:50.47]Calm down.
[106:50.95]This is fucking crazy exciting for me.
[106:57.81]Thank you.
[107:20.68]That was a narcissist.
[107:21.88]He can't help but tell people to look at him.
[107:25.81]Can't.
[107:32.61]Oh, only one more painting, and I get another spatula.
[107:39.43]Is this the time of the stream when the dude's actually having, like, kind of a fun time, and he just always falls back to the, like, the, oh, he's gonna say, like, this game sucks, haha.
[107:47.70]Are we there yet?
[107:48.48]I'm not sure.
[107:49.46]Have I arrived on time?
[107:54.52]What time is it?
[107:55.28]Is it Jeremy's playing a puzzle platforming kind of game?
[107:59.16]Like, platformer collect'em game?
[108:00.67]And he's like, oh, this game fucking sucks, right?
[108:02.33]Like, he makes that funny joke he does every time he plays a 3D platformer.
[108:07.73]Sick of him.
[108:26.49]You don't sound sober, Jeremy.
[108:28.63]Are you okay?
[108:32.74]Yeah.
[108:33.02]Oh, yes, I am.
[108:34.08]I'm as sober as a stone.
[108:36.66]Alright, Mrs. Puff has got a spatula for me.
[108:55.66]Pretty good 5G sound.
[108:57.04]He's stoned.
[109:00.72]You are right.
[109:22.95]This dude's on painkillers.
[109:24.52]They're not narcotic.
[109:26.02]One more.
[109:27.94]Stop saying that.
[109:53.96]So true, but don't don't say that anymore I was the last one got that one you got I Need this one over Right
[110:23.15]Where's that last one?
[110:26.73]One, two, three.
[110:28.49]Okay, so I gotta go that way.
[110:45.52]Oh!
[110:48.36]Free clams!
[110:55.17]Did I jump into that?
[110:56.17]What the heck?
[111:00.11]Alright, do you trust a guy that says, heck?
[111:02.77]Oh, the heck.
[111:04.35]Oh, heck!
[111:13.38]I say that a lot.
[111:14.18]Do we trust you?
[111:32.05]Don't do that to me.
[111:33.41]Why'd you move forward?
[111:36.93]You gonna do anything with the same vibe as Sorcery?
[111:39.43]Probably.
[111:43.70]I would like to.
[111:44.20]I mean, Sorcery's fucking awesome.
[111:45.72]I love that game.
[111:46.30]Alright, where did that platform... I gotta go to that platform with the red circle on it.
[112:00.78]Where did that go?
[112:01.56]Where was that?
[112:04.52]Back here?
[112:09.27]When is low move... I don't even know what you're saying.
[112:13.03]I promised something?
[112:14.07]That's another slide.
[112:21.82]That's not...
[112:30.95]What did I... Wait, what did I promise?
[112:35.01]Isn't this the beginning of the level?
[112:39.59]What am I looking for here?
[112:40.83]Did I miss it?
[112:44.81]Did I beat... Oh, there it is.
[112:47.45]Okay.
[112:48.27]How do I get over there?
[112:48.85]Do I have to be Spongebob to get over there?
[112:53.69]I have to go around.
[113:00.13]Finish Saw.
[113:03.56]Oh, I'm not gonna finish Saw.
[113:06.14]I'm just gonna walk through a shotgun thing again and let my head blow up.
[113:09.78]Uh...
[113:31.27]What do you mean everybody leave?
[113:32.59]I'm not gonna... Why would I finish Saw?
[113:36.31]The game was very, very, very poor.
[113:39.67]Look, how about this?
[113:40.51]I'll play Saw 2.
[113:41.63]There's another one.

[116:17.13]I know you are.
[116:21.82]I can see.
[116:22.52]Somebody put fire man.
[116:24.38]Somebody said put like... Yeah.
[116:25.58]Yeah.

[116:27.57]Like, oh, fireman, fireman.
[116:28.61]Like, oh, he's like, blaze it up.
[116:30.09]Like, no, stop that.
[116:31.29]Don't do that.
[116:34.65]Like, 420.
[116:35.31]No, stop that.
[116:36.07]I fucking know what you're doing.
[116:41.14]Oh, do that face where it's like his face is fucking fucked up because he's on, like, drugs and shit.
[116:44.92]Don't do that.
[116:45.42]I know what you're doing.
[116:48.23]I don't like to see.
[116:48.85]Turn off emote only mode.
[116:50.05]They're fucking with me.
[116:50.87]Turn it off.
[117:11.37]You missed a spatula?
[117:12.69]No, wait, what?
[117:13.85]I did not miss a spatula.
[117:19.68]This chat sucks, laughing my ass off.
[117:21.90]Don't say that!
[117:23.94]Because I just read that and now they think I said it.
[117:39.85]I was going to try, but I said fuck it.
[117:44.63]You know what's crazy?
[117:45.43]I have not even tried it once.
[117:46.98]I have not done one... Ah, with shaking my throat.
[117:51.10]I haven't done it once because I'm afraid.
[117:53.26]I'm scared.
[117:54.76]I'm scared it's not going to be good enough and everyone's going to -2 and be like, holy shit, that was so embarrassing and so bad.
[118:01.34]Can you believe I haven't even attempted?
[118:04.84]It's been like eight plus stream hours on this game and I haven't even attempted it.
[118:15.02]It has to be a record.
[118:16.72]If Spongebob is on screen, I'm going to do it, right?
[118:28.32]Where are we at here?
[118:35.84]Oh, this is the downtown spot.
[118:37.40]Wait a minute.
[118:38.19]Oh, shit.
[118:38.91]Shit.
[118:47.03]Nice.
[118:47.67]Okay, so you see the tracks go this way.
[118:51.41]And they shift.
[118:53.11]Okay, here we go.
[119:04.69]Well, I made it.
[119:08.72]I'm gonna have to- Hey, Mr. Krabs, what are you doing?
[119:14.81]How does this chat stand you?
[119:16.21]I'm... What?
[119:16.75]What the heck?
[119:17.14]Could I be a different character?
[119:43.75]Sand?
[119:43.93]Okay, I'm going to be Sandy.
[119:46.67]Wait, I have to press that button.
[119:48.21]Alright, press the button.
[119:57.48]Oh, okay.
[119:57.98]We got to go now.
[120:00.92]Okay.

[120:52.59]So therefore, all games that are platformers, 3D platformers, are kids' games, right?
[121:01.36]Simpsons Hit and Run.
[121:03.12]Yes.
[121:03.46]No, I'm wrong.
[121:04.14]No, no.
[121:06.06]What's a 3D platformer that is like this that's not a kids' game, then?
[121:16.90]Honker.
[121:17.88]Yes.
[121:18.28]Okay, so take the one game...
[121:20.88]Okay, delete, conquer.
[121:22.74]What is it?
[121:23.10]There's no game like Doom that plays like this.
[121:30.22]Gex?
[121:32.88]Gex is not a 3D platformer.
[121:37.78]And what are you talking about?
[121:38.64]It's a cartoon character.
[121:45.30]Yes!
[121:50.34]Gex is like a cartoon character.
[121:53.64]Isn't he?
[121:54.82]Wait, shit.
[121:55.34]Is he just a Geico?
[121:56.36]I was going to say rabbit.
[121:58.22]Geico?
[122:00.42]He wears like a suit.
[122:01.44]Does he have a British accent?
[122:04.22]It's the Geico Gecko, isn't it?
[122:11.22]Does Gex have a British accent?
[122:16.58]Does Gex talk?
[122:23.33]No.
[122:23.71]Yes, he does.
[122:34.34]And by the way, to the one person that said, play Glover.
[122:37.52]No.
[122:38.38]And by the way, I'm not talking about right now.
[122:39.58]I'm talking about like seven days ago.
[122:41.02]Like six days ago, somebody said, hey, play Glover.
[122:42.92]And I was like, eh, nah.
[122:46.98]Okay, what do we got?
[122:48.66]Return the museum's art.
[122:51.48]Lasers are fun and good for you.
[122:55.19]Wait, I didn't get this?
[122:59.85]What?
[123:00.53]Oh, I have to talk to Plankton.
[123:06.26]We told you you missed one.
[123:07.12]I'm always going to take a look.
[123:20.06]Okay, now we go back to the museum's art.
[123:22.80]I'm just collecting... I'm just collecting MAD spatulas.
[123:25.98]44.
[123:26.00]I got 40, now I can do the one with 40?
[123:49.34]I missed one.
[123:50.10]I've not done this task.
[123:53.70]It's alright.
[123:54.32]Oh, I can miss one.
[123:55.54]I can miss one.
[123:56.30]I've got to turn in some socks to Patrick.
[124:00.06]Let's just do that.
[124:00.88]Man, like, why even do this?
[124:04.60]Okay, I went by these really fast and I saw... I thought it said ambush Squidward.
[124:12.78]Like, kill Squidward?
[124:14.92]Why?
[124:19.23]Alright, let's go to here.
[124:32.05]Okay, Patrick.
[124:35.33]I've got a sock for you.
[124:39.41]Almost have enough for another one.
[124:43.02]He does that every time, doesn't he?
[124:44.74]Alright, 45.
[124:45.30]Nice.
[124:45.46]How many socks do I have?
[124:46.92]Seven.
[124:47.26]Should I buy another one from Mr. Krabs?
[124:49.50]Hmm.
[124:49.64]Not yet.
[125:26.41]Been in there.
[125:28.05]Went to rock bottom.
[125:31.82]Sand mountain?
[125:33.54]Or... Hold on.
[125:34.10]There's one on top of this.
[125:34.96]Hold on.
[125:35.46]This is the golden underwear over there.
[125:40.25]Yeah, let's go.
[125:45.89]Boss?
[125:47.51]They all look like they made out of ice cream.
[125:49.19]I love this game.
[125:50.01]Ice cream cake material.
[125:51.57]It's more important I make that clear.
[126:11.64]Well, we better figure something out, and pronto.
[126:14.34]Maybe that button on his back is a self-destruct.
[126:17.18]I'll try to hit it.
[126:18.28]Good idea, SpongeBob.
[126:19.58]But it's time to stop yapping and get to it.
[126:22.56]Yikes.
[126:23.74]Looks like SpongeBob's in for a rough ride.
[126:27.14]Can I hit him back?
[126:27.82]There's a button on his back.
[126:29.40]Great barrier reef.
[126:33.31]He's got a button on his back.
[126:35.13]He's probably going to get dizzy.
[126:37.47]Look at that.
[126:38.43]The robot's made himself dizzy.
[126:42.06]He's not so hard.
[126:46.58]Wait, I gotta be Sandy for something?
[127:12.52]I'm going to have to swing around, probably?
[127:13.94]I'm just going to die at least four times.
[127:19.07]Okay, let's make sure I don't die once.
[127:20.93]No!
[127:21.79]No!
[127:38.03]That's the barf sound, yup.
[127:39.67]Oh, great Barrier Reef!
[128:09.36]I've played a third of the bosses in every Spider-Man video game.
[128:15.99]I know how this works.
[128:17.03]Oh, come on.
[128:33.43]Come on.
[128:35.98]Land.
[128:38.00]Land.
[128:39.58]Okay.
[128:40.08]Now we have to... Oops.
[128:44.64]Wait, it instantly kills?
[128:48.34]That's an instant kill?
[128:51.04]Or is this one?
[128:51.56]It's an instant kill.
[128:54.58]What is Sandy going to do to get SpongeBob unfrozen?
[128:58.68]Great barrier reef!
[129:03.33]I don't know, was it an instant kill?
[129:07.45]Look at that!
[129:08.37]The robot's made himself dizzy!
[129:10.59]Now the robot's taking a beating up!
[129:13.19]Alright, so I have to stay on these, and sometimes it's not going to be good.
[129:16.67]Sometimes it's not going to be right.
[129:18.53]That hot goo could melt anything!
[129:20.89]Alright, where are they placed?
[129:27.70]Do-si-do and around you go!
[129:39.28]Okay, here we go.
[129:41.12]Don't touch it.
[129:41.84]Just... Oops.
[129:51.51]Okay, so what do I... Can I lasso him?
[130:06.16]Can't lasso him from here.
[130:09.47]Did I drop something on his head?
[130:13.15]Great barrier reef!
[130:17.94]Oh, most encounters of the painful kind!
[130:23.22]Great barrier reef!
[130:30.83]Oh, and the robot is down!
[130:32.27]Oh, and the robot is down!
[130:36.82]Alright, you just gotta be good.
[130:39.58]You just gotta be good.
[130:40.32]Whoa!
[130:40.66]Okay.
[130:40.84]You just gotta be good.
[130:42.46]Smooth.
[130:42.94]Alright, go down.
[131:05.21]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[131:08.04]I can't get over there Great barrier reef Oh and the robot is down
[131:41.86]Yeah, I know.
[131:42.54]Very funny.
[131:43.22]Very funny.
[131:43.98]Very funny.
[131:44.60]We can see your balls.
[131:45.98]Yeah, very funny.
[131:47.58]What kind of camera would I need to have here?
[131:49.65]What kind of camera angle?
[131:52.07]And what?
[131:53.09]What?
[131:53.23]Just pointing down?
[131:57.75]Well, why would I do that?
[132:06.93]Right there.
[132:10.11]Right there.
[132:25.59]I didn't get him.
[132:26.57]Am I dead?
[132:27.49]No, I get it.
[132:29.65]Okay, so you have to wait till he goes, oh, the robot is down.
[132:34.34]Come on.
[132:54.46]Alright, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[132:56.40]Just survive.
[133:01.43]I forgot he could do that.
[133:02.47]Stay alive!
[133:12.81]I see a prime bowling moment right here.
[133:15.81]Why did I explode?
[133:17.57]What did I explode for?
[133:19.93]Oh, that hurt.
[133:20.63]Hold on.
[133:21.03]That does it.
[133:22.61]SpongeBob is back in the fight.
[133:25.27]SpongeBob better stay far away from the robot's old clutches.
[133:29.50]If you touch it on the ground...
[133:41.05]SpongeBob.
[133:41.83]SpongeBob.
[133:42.09]I see a prime bowling moment right here.
[133:45.15]This boy must be smoking at the lanes.
[133:51.99]SpongeBob.
[133:53.13]Oh, yeah, right.
[133:54.18]That's some like Warcraft mage bullshit.
[133:56.88]Great barrier reef.
[133:59.20]I happen to be targeting you, so the fucking frost bolt just followed you around three walls.
[134:04.12]A prime bowling moment right here.
[134:06.00]And the robot is down.
[134:14.81]Quick, go hit the router.
[134:16.55]Why?
[134:16.77]Is my computer fucked up?
[134:17.65]What, I have a fucked up computer?
[134:34.01]Thanks for saving me, guys.
[134:36.11]I never thought I'd say this, SpongeBob, but I owe you big time.
[134:40.47]Thanks, Sandy.
[134:41.66]We'd still be popsicles if it wasn't for her.
[134:44.06]Oh, shit.
[134:44.44]Yeah, I have dropped some frames.
[134:45.84]Oh, no.
[134:47.38]The internet.
[134:48.94]Oh, no.
[134:49.66]The internet problems are back.
[134:52.80]Oh, yeah.
[134:55.82]I'm sorry, Plankton.
[134:57.18]The Chum Bucket Lab is locked up tight.
[134:59.38]No, I'm on fucking fiber.
[135:00.48]That shit ain't happening anymore.
[135:06.40]There's a couple of bumps sometimes.
[135:07.92]It's alright.
[135:13.02]Oh, okay.
[135:13.68]So that's the boss to get to the third area?
[135:15.88]Your stream is down.
[135:35.87]So what are you going to do, Plankton?
[135:38.59]We, of course, meaning you, are going to have to go out there and get those golden spatulas.
[135:44.66]Or I'll never get back into the Chum Bucket and regain control of my robots.
[135:48.58]What was that?
[135:49.72]Oh, I said, will I ever get back into the Chum Bucket to stain all my pots?
[135:56.54]Something's fishy here.
[135:57.72]Plankton.
[136:00.18]Alright, now I get to... There's spatulas over here.
[136:07.45]Uh-huh.
[136:09.29]I've been trying to get this one for the last, like, three days.
[136:12.07]You're gonna do that to me right now?
[136:17.87]Wait, what?
[136:23.65]Wait a minute.
[136:24.01]Hey.
[136:24.55]What's going on?
[136:32.93]What the fuck is happening?
[136:37.18]He just put me in the same spot!
[136:43.72]Stop touching me!
[136:44.80]That's not how you do it.
[137:19.36]You have to press buttons, though.
[137:27.43]Oh, shit.
[137:28.09]He's getting fibered.
[137:29.97]No, no, no, no, no.
[137:32.12]Don't worry.
[137:33.10]Don't worry.
[137:35.38]Super pinky shake on it?
[137:38.16]I would if I had pinkies.
[137:42.32]Here, I'll blow you some.
[137:44.12]Yeah, maybe later.
[137:45.02]Pay attention, SpongeBob.
[137:47.22]This bubble's a doozy.
[137:49.59]Paying my entire salary in attention.
[137:53.69]When you're not moving, press this button, and you'll blow a bubble that you can steer as it flies through the air.
[138:00.41]Wow.
[138:04.83]Aim carefully, though.
[138:06.03]You've only got a few seconds of flight time before the bubble pops.
[138:09.89]I'm a bubble-blowing machine.
[138:12.71]New move.
[138:22.15]Sorry.
[138:24.89]Wait, okay.
[138:30.19]Wait, there's underwear up there.
[138:32.89]Wait, does this count as me?
[138:34.45]Does this count as my body?
[138:55.67]Wait, hold on.
[139:05.65]It's like, I'm just so, so engrossed in the drone's camera.
[139:12.97]It's like, oh wait, that's actually coming for me, right.
[139:37.80]What is this?
[139:38.80]Ooh, that was a lot.
[139:42.86]Help Forest.
[139:47.18]Do I have 46?
[139:47.56]I don't have enough.
[139:48.50]Alright, let's go.
[139:52.08]I want to go in the Krusty Krab.
[139:53.08]60.
[139:53.18]Hit the buttons.
[139:59.79]Hold on.
[140:00.21]I want to talk to Mr. Krabs.
[140:01.51]Hit the buttons.
[140:02.09]Hold on.
[140:02.37]I want to talk to Mr. Krabs.
[140:09.25]You gotta help me, boy.
[140:10.99]The Krusty Krab's been overrun by a bunch of them hoodlum robots of yours.
[140:15.27]They've booted me out.
[140:17.27]And worse, they've got all me beautiful, shiny objects.
[140:21.13]See, filing the Krusty Krab?
[140:23.76]Is there no end to their evil?
[140:25.70]What are we going to do, Mr. Krabs?
[140:27.40]We, meaning you, are going to clear the robots out, get me back me restaurant, and most importantly, rescue me money!
[140:36.20]Okay.
[140:40.22]I'll handle it, Mr. Crab.
[140:41.22]I feel like I should be working.
[140:47.64]Are you ready, kids?
[140:50.16]Go!
[140:53.40]I love opening presents.
[140:58.80]You've just met the Sponginator.
[141:06.26]Oh, don't do it.
[141:08.44]Oh.
[141:38.85]If it keeps up, I'm just going to turn off my fucking VPN.
[141:46.74]I know, I know.
[141:47.26]He's on a VPN.
[141:48.02]He's fucking stupid.
[141:48.80]I know.
[141:49.10]That's what is happening.
[141:50.16]Trust me.
[141:50.52]I know.
[141:50.96]It's happened before.
[141:51.46]Why is this lady still in here?
[142:08.98]I really probably should just missile launch this guy over here.
[142:16.32]Fuck, I missed.
[142:22.21]He's using Netflix to watch anime?
[142:24.33]I did it.
[142:43.25]I'll take my spatula.
[142:46.41]I mean, the one cool thing is I've dropped 1,337 frames.
[142:49.79]Somebody is going to be like happy about that.
[142:51.70]I think someone will be happy about it.
[142:53.52]Alright.
[143:03.06]Did I miss anything else in here?
[143:23.49]Destroy the whole Krusty Krab.
[143:26.01]I don't want to do that.
[143:28.09]That's mean.
[143:33.82]I'll get these though.
[143:37.64]Grandma watches My Hero Academia with a VPN.
[143:43.85]Why would you need a VPN to watch My Hero Academia?
[143:53.96]I need a VPN?
[143:55.36]I did it.
[143:56.88]Where's my spatula?
[143:58.08]Why would you need a VPN to stream?
[143:59.66]I don't.
[143:59.90]I use it... Alright, listen.
[144:22.05]I use a VPN for the added extra security.
[144:26.24]And bullet point number one.
[144:27.56]I use it for bullet point number two.
[144:29.54]And I use it for bullet point number three on their website.
[144:31.70]Okay.

[160:07.82]And I was terrible at those.
[160:08.94]Alright, we went right last time.
[160:11.66]Let's go this way.

[161:58.68]That's kind of two things going on here.
[162:05.39]I just sit here and do this shit.
[162:06.69]If the stream wasn't on, I'd be doing the same thing.
[162:09.09]I told you.
[162:13.05]Kim talks about this a lot.
[162:14.55]Kim will be in the other room.
[162:16.85]And she'll just hear me in here just saying the same fucking ten words over and over again.

[162:57.54]I've spent like five days doing it over and over again, and I was driving her crazy.
[163:01.40]Alright, I gotta finish the slide.
[163:07.30]Which way does it go?
[163:14.95]Deceiving.

[165:39.77]It has to land on the one spot.
[165:55.67]Whoa, it just threw me straight down.

[175:18.49]The consonants in the middle there make it fun to say in a radio sense.
[175:24.13]Amazingly awful, you mean.

[205:38.51]Oh boy!
[205:39.35]Can I have it?
[205:43.59]Sure, if you fall down to the bottom of this pit.
[205:48.36]Isn't there a safer way?

[207:14.15]Beat my time.
[207:14.49]Yeah.
[207:14.65]70 seconds.
[207:38.07]That's kind of soft.
[207:44.71]I don't know what I just did.
[207:47.16]I don't know what I did.
[207:51.80]The spoling ball.
[207:53.58]The snowball.
[208:00.57]Ooh, this one's a little tougher.
[208:02.93]Why did I say it louder?
[208:03.99]I don't know.
[208:15.77]Alright, don't get hit too many times.
[208:17.09]Do I have to go on the right?
[208:19.75]Oh shit.

[208:45.71]I don't think I'm ever going to have 40,000.
[208:54.19]I doubt I'm going to have 40,000 of those shells.
[208:56.23]Go to the theater?
[208:58.35]That seems kind of impossible.
[209:04.25]We've got to grind.
[209:05.87]What's in there?
[209:06.57]Is it worth it?
[209:10.57]Do we actually get to see...

[210:31.94]No, I didn't.
[210:38.08]No, I didn't.
[210:46.91]Where is she?
[210:48.33]Wasn't she right at the beginning?
[210:54.01]Right at the beginning of the first mountain.
[210:55.63]I thought that was right in the door?
[211:04.19]No.
[211:04.85]I was supposed to go in the bucket, basket, box.

[213:23.31]I'm holding up on the defense.
[213:31.71]Um... I guess it's this way.
[213:35.41]I feel like I'm going back up the mountain.
[213:38.05]Did I go the wrong way?
[213:52.06]No.
[213:56.53]This feels close.
[213:59.73]Closer than it should be.
[214:08.36]5 4 3 2 1 Hey, I didn't go this way.

[220:57.53]It's risky.
[220:57.77]Can I jump past that?
[221:12.59]I don't know.
[221:14.17]Oh, wait.
[221:14.59]I could jump down, I think.
[221:15.49]Alright, I can go down from there.
[221:22.58]I need some good skips right now.
[221:53.40]Can I skip anything here?
[221:54.36]Okay.
[221:58.48]Just go straight down.
[221:59.20]Okay.
[222:03.17]Straight.
[222:04.33]Straight through.
[222:04.85]Straight.
[222:07.41]Straight through.
[222:07.83]This is the one right here.
[222:11.49]I got it.
[222:11.91]I got it.
[222:12.19]I have six.
[222:13.27]Five.
[222:14.29]Four.
[222:15.28]Three.
[222:16.30]Two.
[222:16.82]Yeah.
[222:17.26]I'm so... I'm so good.
[222:22.25]I'm so bad.
[222:27.08]So good.
[222:27.52]I'm bad.
[222:28.06]I'm so good.
[222:28.82]Bad at it.
[222:39.23]Power.
[222:53.28]Spatula and I get two spatulas.
[222:55.70]This is sick.
[223:00.94]Jerma never sounds like a real human being.
[223:06.73]What does that mean?
[223:11.97]I don't sound like a human being?
[223:13.49]I sound like a fake person.
[223:25.85]More so than any other streamer you fucking hear on the internet?
[223:36.80]How do I sound like a fake person?
[223:41.99]Are you just so used to hearing fake people that a real person like me, a real guy, sounds weird to you?
[224:00.27]It's like a ventriloquist dummy.
[224:05.99]So you think I sound like when somebody's talking through the other guy and he's trying to make us keep his lips together.
[224:13.27]I'll give you a golden spatula if you can beat my time.
[224:17.47]So you guys think that I talk like this.
[224:19.23]This is how I talk on a regular basis.
[224:23.17]Oh, it sure is cold outside.
[224:25.51]How's the weather?
[224:29.40]As my friend drinks a full glass of water.
[224:31.90]What are you talking about?
[224:32.88]That's a really irritating me today.
[224:35.54]Really irritating me today.
[224:36.82]Oh, yeah.
[224:53.09]I'm sorry.
[224:53.67]I'm just kidding.
[224:55.55]I'm just kidding, guys.
[224:56.97]Come on.
[224:57.41]You know what I'm saying?
[225:08.26]Whoa!
[225:08.90]Whoa!
[225:15.68]Why are they moving?
[225:24.17]What did I do that for?!
[225:25.07]I was trying to like jump off the side and be wicked cocky.
[225:34.85]I'll do it again.
[226:01.92]Alright, let's do it again.
[226:07.26]When are you going to play Paper Mario?
[226:15.61]I don't know.
[226:17.57]Never.
[226:17.83]Probably like on July 30th of 2021.
[226:37.62]That was bullshit.
[226:48.23]I like these, though.
[226:48.87]They're hard.
[226:49.27]I don't even need to skip.
[226:51.71]I'll do my own.
[226:57.96]I need to skip.
[226:58.48]I'll get it.
[227:00.38]I'm ready.
[227:01.14]I'm ready.
[227:01.96]I'm ready.
[227:11.14]That really knocks you way far on the other side.
[227:13.70]Oh shit, there's a sock!
[227:16.36]I didn't even get it!
[227:23.03]Okay, this is the one.
[227:24.55]This is actually the one.
[227:42.86]These levels are actually fun, though.
[227:44.16]I mean, if you put a racing segment in your game, or a slide segment, it better be fun.
[227:50.13]These are fun.
[227:50.65]These are very, very, very fun.
[228:22.67]Okay, I'm safe.
[228:34.08]Left or right?
[228:34.96]Left?
[228:36.82]Only one way.
[228:37.40]Left or right?
[228:37.92]Right!
[228:38.08]Is this smart?
[228:48.83]Um...
[228:51.47]Where's the exit?
[228:52.15]I don't know.
[228:56.47]I don't know.
[228:56.87]Where is it?
[228:57.21]10 seconds.
[228:57.49]6, 5, 4, 3.
[228:57.57]Son of a gun.
[229:23.43]Do it to Sandy?
[229:24.77]No, that's a good... I'm going to do it to Sandy.
[229:41.30]That's a good call.
[229:41.96]I get the spatula though.
[229:57.95]That's a spatula.
[229:58.71]65.
[230:02.21]I'm going to be Sandy.
[230:13.75]Just follow the boulder.
[230:14.95]I will.
[230:15.33]Alright, let's do it.
[230:23.00]Follow the... I can't do it as Sandy.
[230:26.44]Thanks for the jubade.
[230:30.71]Follow the boulder.
[230:31.41]I will follow the boulder into my death.
[230:35.41]I will follow the boulder until I die.
[230:39.08]You understand?
[230:44.78]Whatever.
[230:45.02]Fuck it.
[231:09.47]Stop saying suboptimal.
[231:11.31]I know it's suboptimal.
[231:12.57]You don't have to remind me.
[231:13.49]Alright, I'm going to follow the boulder.
[231:16.41]Wherever it goes, I'm going to go.
[231:18.58]No matter what.
[231:19.26]Even if it kills me.
[231:21.78]Even if I die, I'm going where it is.
[231:25.02]Follow the boulder.
[231:34.08]Oh, look at this.
[231:39.47]Sock!
[231:40.93]Where's he gonna put me?
[231:43.01]Cool.
[231:43.32]That probably shaved off at least 10 seconds.
[232:08.71]I have a wicked itchy face.
[232:10.84]What do I do?
[232:16.73]Don't go that way!
[232:18.03]You see that bullshit?
[232:45.69]I get them all do I have all these spatulas from slip slide mountain 66. congratulations spongebob you beat my best time here's a spatula

[233:20.11]I got them all here.
[233:20.73]I did them all.
[233:24.72]Yeah, this place was pretty cool.
[233:25.78]Yeah, you're right.
[233:26.62]You guys were right.
[233:28.18]Okay, now I have 60.
[233:31.44]How many more areas are there?
[233:40.57]Do the snowmen?
[233:42.15]It's going to be a sock.
[233:42.95]I don't want it.
[233:54.54]okay so 50 to go that way 60 to go that way which one's more interesting kelp forest or this way oh this one looks creepy flying dutchman's graveyard yeah I want to go here
[234:24.31]The graveyard of ships.
[234:26.95]Somewhere among this haunted mess, a fearsome specter awaits.
[234:32.30]Is this a boss?
[234:39.02]The Flying Dutchman.
[234:40.48]It's a great voice.
[234:41.19]I love the voice here.
[234:47.17]Yes.
[234:49.09]Same actor.
[234:49.81]Yes.
[234:50.11]Who dares disturb the Flying Dutchman?
[234:54.51]I'm too scared.
[235:14.76]They've thrown me off my own ship, they have.
[235:17.66]Being thrown off your own ship is like having your pants pulled down in front of casual acquaintances.
[235:22.86]It's a sad, sad thing.
[235:25.00]No, I can't do... I can't do a Flying Dutchman.
[235:27.14]I can't do it.
[235:29.04]Now those robots have got their own pirate ship, and they're blasted away!
[235:32.71]Now those robots have got their own pirate ship!
[235:35.49]No, nobody can do that besides that guy.
[235:38.95]Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?
[235:46.87]That was the worst impression ever.
[235:53.45]It was not the worst impression ever.
[235:55.09]Okay?
[235:57.26]It wasn't.
[235:58.32]There were so many worse ones over the years.
[236:00.54]Activate the cannons.
[236:01.10]Bane?
[236:01.28]Bane was good.
[236:10.57]I don't know why everyone gives me so much shit for my Bane.
[236:12.71]I don't get it.
[236:14.09]I seriously don't understand.
[236:17.09]Why is this such a bad impression?
[236:21.40]I don't understand why you'd- That's fucking good.
[236:24.80]That's good.
[236:26.00]That's a good- That sounds like the guy in the movie.
[236:28.78]That's the point of an impression.
[236:30.47]Whether you like it or not, that's what he sounds like in the movie.
[236:42.13]He sounds like that may have just been him there.
[236:51.63]Hey, don't do that.
[237:06.68]Okay.
[237:07.32]We have Sandy.
[237:09.48]We can get Sandy if we want.
[237:12.08]If we want.
[237:12.78]But only if we want.
[237:17.33]Okay, so we've got stuff over there.
[237:33.87]Why won't you parry?
[237:35.39]Because parry, I dodge.
[237:37.05]I don't parry, I dodge.
[237:39.63]So let's start.
[237:47.03]This way.
[237:47.81]Is there a bus stop?
[237:48.94]Let's see.
[237:50.82]Alright, that's it.
[237:57.86]I'm banning Omega Lothan from my Twitch chat.
[238:02.54]People are laughing way too much and having way too much fun and shit.
[238:05.18]No, not here.
[238:06.00]I don't want you to have any fucking fun here.
[238:07.62]People are having too much fun in that battle.
[238:16.49]Everyone needs to be silent.
[238:17.99]Oh shit, there's a button in here.
[238:30.75]What does this do?
[238:47.27]Turned off the... Do I have to, like, release that from the cage or something?
[238:59.04]Get rid of the... Poison?
[239:03.30]Alright, so I have to... I gotta come back here later.
[239:04.90]Get rid of the poison.
[239:06.80]There's 3,000 clams.
[239:08.02]Great, I just wasted that.
[239:11.14]Turn the poison off.
[239:13.50]Uh, well.
[239:17.28]Take a look at what that is.
[239:20.04]Got it.
[239:21.52]Oh, curious.
[239:22.48]Can I move this?
[239:31.33]I can.
[239:32.19]I can move that.
[239:38.85]Is this TF2 music?
[239:42.61]Maybe a little.
[239:44.43]Come with the invasion.
[239:45.15]No.
[239:55.60]No, well then I don't know what you mean then.
[240:00.02]I don't know.
[240:01.30]Okay.
[240:04.44]Then we go... I gotta get Sandy.
[240:07.24]Sandy's... Wait, I can turn this shit off.
[240:20.88]That was risky.
[240:25.54]Everyone's having fun again?
[240:26.58]You know, that makes me more angry than anything.
[240:34.29]Fun.
[240:38.21]No more of that.
[240:42.37]Okay, so can I... Can you go all the way over here?
[240:47.13]Uh... Yeah?
[240:48.19]Yeah?
[240:49.75]Yeah?
[240:51.79]And then, uh... Uh... Oh!
[241:06.58]Sandy is so strong in... Uh, yes.
[241:09.74]Yes.
[241:14.26]Now I can go down there.
[241:19.31]Let's go activate... Wait, sock!
[241:24.63]This is moving.
[241:27.63]I don't like when it moves.
[241:29.11]Get out of here.
[241:30.69]Hit it.
[241:31.01]Come on, I need Sandy!
[241:35.06]Sandy!
[241:56.16]I need you right now for this bullshit.
[242:07.31]Platforming is fun in this game.
[242:11.45]Alright, where's the thing spawning these assholes?
[242:20.90]Okay.
[242:21.34]Whoa, what?
[242:23.50]That's...
[242:29.10]No!
[242:30.02]It's gonna kill me.
[242:30.70]Jump!
[242:35.82]You can have fun sometimes.
[242:38.00]Pain in the ass.
[242:43.58]Pain in the ass.
[242:46.52]Now I gotta move this again.
[242:56.36]I don't play TF2 anymore.
[243:02.19]I don't because I've played it for like 10 straight years.
[243:15.26]Okay, here we go.
[243:23.29]Say wicked.
[243:23.87]Wicked!
[243:26.14]He hates it.
[243:30.40]I got what I wanted out of it.
[243:32.41]I had a lot of fun.
[243:34.59]And I don't play it anymore.
[243:38.07]It's like reading a good book.
[243:39.07]You know, like I've read the book a bunch of different times.
[243:42.81]I made up different voices for all the characters more than three or four times in my head.
[243:48.74]Okay, I hate these things.
[243:52.03]See, I fucking hate these things.
[243:54.27]Like, these are stupid.
[243:55.39]Okay.
[243:56.17]Go.
[243:57.92]You know what?
[243:58.84]Let's just cheese this right now.
[244:06.20]I'll get it.
[244:08.08]Whatever.
[244:36.72]No, get out of the way.
[244:37.94]I'm trying to get out of the way.
[244:39.02]Get away from my camera.
[244:54.53]I got in the way of the shot and the camera just bumped him right in the fucking head.
[245:00.67]Okay, now move this, and then move this one.
[245:12.82]Whoa, is that it?
[245:14.00]Did I get to the top of the mountain?
[245:15.40]I did.
[245:15.94]Wait.
[245:16.76]I see one.
[245:22.79]Later.
[245:28.83]Have I ever streamed Ratchet and Clank?
[245:30.05]No.
[245:32.39]Not that I wouldn't stream Ratchet and Clank.
[245:35.37]I just haven't streamed Ratchet and Clank.
[245:38.93]Maybe.
[245:39.27]I've definitely been... Been into it before.
[245:43.84]The problem with Ratchet and Clank is there are so many of them.
[245:49.58]And they've remade them, right?
[245:51.24]Once or twice.
[245:51.80]That it's... I don't know which one to play.
[245:54.86]Which one do I play?
[245:57.03]Which is one... Because I'm not going to play like five Ratchet and Clank games.
[246:00.25]I'm telling you.
[246:00.67]That's not going to happen.

[246:14.83]I don't know.
[246:18.45]They're all awful.
[246:31.31]You don't think they're any good?

[249:04.12]If you're curious what I think, I think this game is very good.
[249:07.54]If you don't own this game, it's currently on Steam.
[249:09.87]And, whoa, boy, is it good.
[249:13.69]Some people have compared it.
[249:16.71]I've heard some people describe it as a Mario Odyssey.
[249:19.17]Yeah, I've heard that.
[249:21.31]Somebody said that before.
[249:27.32]I don't know who they were, but I bet they were real handsome.
[249:34.60]It's fucking nothing like Mario Odyssey.
[249:36.92]Don't buy it if you think it's Mario Odyssey.
[249:38.38]Am I going to lose?
[249:38.96]Can I make that?

[251:02.23]No, I'm not.
[251:09.29]Why do I game naked?
[251:10.98]Why do you game clothed?
[251:12.18]You know how free you are without the clothes on?
[251:18.38]It shines!
[251:29.10]This part is harder and they made it easier in the remake.
[251:36.29]2700.
[251:36.45]This is going to be a spatula, right?
[251:42.29]Has to be.
[251:47.14]Yep.
[251:47.42]68.
[251:54.20]Put your cam on and show us how free you are.
[251:59.18]No, I'd like to continue streaming on Twitch.
[252:05.13]I'm not gonna do this.
[252:05.85]Alright, get off.
[252:22.78]July 30th naked stream.
[252:27.81]How long do you realistically think it would take?
[252:29.81]If I were turned?
[252:31.69]Oh, who cares?
[252:35.55]How long do you think it would realistically take if I turned on the cam right now and I was naked?
[252:40.85]And I wasn't even talking about it.
[252:41.89]I was just sitting here playing naked.
[252:43.89]How long until I'm gone?
[252:48.05]You think it'd be more than 30 seconds?
[252:49.27]I think it'd probably be like at least four to five minutes before everyone... There was like fucking red alert buttons going off at Twitch HQ.
[253:01.50]You think it would take three hours?
[253:03.02]No, it would not.
[253:03.86]It would take, like, two minutes.
[253:06.50]Three hours?
[253:10.44]That's just funny to think about that, because... Shit.
[253:15.00]Ugh, I'm hysterical.
[253:32.92]Oh, so close.
[253:47.08]What's wrong?
[253:47.90]Why is he... He does a big finish, and that's what I fucked up.
[254:02.25]There, that.
[254:02.89]That big finish.
[254:03.57]What are you doing?
[254:10.08]Click link.
[254:12.14]No, I'm afraid to cl- I don't want to click that.
[254:36.95]what that's just what I look like without a shirt on that's just what I am that's that is exactly what it is I mean that's a fake photo but that's you don't even need to imagine if that's real or not that's exactly what I look like
[254:54.90]Except one of my nipples slightly points in another direction.
[254:58.74]And it used to piss me off so much when I used to lift.
[255:00.78]I used to get so angry.
[255:03.62]So one of my nipples points down and the other one kind of points up.
[255:07.56]Like frog eyes.
[255:08.39]And it really pisses me off.
[255:10.15]I would sit in the mirror just flexing, just like fucking greased up and shit.
[255:13.01]And I'd be going like, what the fuck?
[255:15.23]Because I would stop flexing and it'd be like, this looks like shit.
[255:24.11]Ooh, the Dutchman's ship.
[255:34.77]Show us.
[255:39.50]No.
[255:42.00]Ahoy there, SpongeBob.
[255:43.74]Swab the poop deck.
[255:45.16]Oh, I already did that joke with Squidward, Mr. Krabs.
[255:51.50]Yes, well, it's a good one, though, eh?
[255:54.57]Do a nipple reveal.
[255:56.87]Oh, yeah.
[255:59.33]Here's what you need to do.
[256:00.99]Destroy all the power generators on the robot ship.
[256:05.23]Once the power is off, you'll be able to shoot the Dutchman's cannons to destroy the robot ship.
[256:11.19]Oh, and there's a sock up there, too, and I'm going to be Sandy.
[256:14.31]Yeah, I make jokes like that all the time, and everybody makes fun of me and calls me a fucking idiot and stupid and wants to, like, punch me.
[256:21.98]SpongeBob does it, and everybody loves him.
[256:24.79]No, they don't.
[256:25.13]Never mind.
[256:25.43]You guys are saying -2.
[256:27.07]Okay, never mind.
[256:27.65]Alright, at least you're consistent.
[256:38.08]Wow, I can't believe anyone would -2 Spongebob Squarepants.
[256:42.53]I feel like that probably felt bad doing.
[256:44.59]You're probably sitting in your chair going like, ugh, fuck, I have to though.
[256:54.34]I feel like a new sponge.
[256:58.63]Consistency in my Jerma chat.
[257:04.47]What, are we inconsistent here?
[257:08.59]Yeah, that sounds about right.
[257:11.83]That sounds about right.
[257:12.83]Maybe some of you new guys, some of the new viewers.
[257:15.06]Wait, can I get up there?
[257:24.63]I can't grab the edge?
[257:25.81]Yes, I can.
[257:29.22]No, I can't.
[257:29.66]This is the best chat on Twitch.
[257:33.04]You know, people give us a little bit of shit.
[257:35.61]I feel like we get some shit, but I think we have one of the best chats on Twitch.
[257:40.69]I feel like we get a little bit of shit for this.
[257:55.76]You're wrong.
[257:58.54]What?
[257:58.94]Did I know every single streamer says this?
[258:02.83]You know, guys, I gotta tell you something.
[258:04.13]I think we got the best stream on Twitch.
[258:06.63]Everybody thinks that.
[258:09.99]That's like just being proud of your son.
[258:13.03]When he throws up on the keyboard in computer class and gets an F.
[258:22.40]My son is fucking perfect.
[258:24.39]My son's fantastic.
[258:25.31]Nothing wrong with him.
[258:40.75]Did you do that?
[258:42.28]No, my dad did.
[258:53.89]Hey, you want some Jerma dad lore?
[258:55.79]He was in like sixth grade.
[258:59.73]He puked on his- he was in like a computer class.
[259:03.15]And this is like really, really old shitty computers.
[259:09.38]No, wait, I'm mixing two stories together.
[259:11.54]My dad didn't fucking puke on a computer.
[259:13.66]Computers didn't exist.
[259:21.49]My father ate a slice of pecan pie one time and he puked in class and he's never eaten a slice of pecan pie ever again since he was in like the fucking eighth grade or something.
[259:33.05]That's a true story.
[259:33.87]I don't know where the computer came from.
[259:35.22]Like he threw up on the computer?
[259:36.46]I don't know where the computer part is.
[259:39.18]Somebody puked on a computer that I know.
[259:41.38]That's certain.
[259:42.04]I know that's certain.
[259:42.94]I know somebody that like puked on a computer in fucking computer class and they had to leave.
[259:48.14]I just think it was one of my friends.
[259:51.72]It wasn't me.
[259:53.00]Okay, I'm dying.
[260:01.47]I'm dying here.
[260:02.49]Stop spawning on me!
[260:11.14]No, my father does not eat pecan pie.
[260:13.27]He doesn't like pecans at all because he ate a slice and he hated it or made him sick or something and he threw up in class.
[260:19.77]Alright, I'm playing the video game now before everybody leaves.
[260:30.85]Too late.
[260:31.95]It's alright.
[260:34.42]Hey, they'll be back tomorrow when we play the 2012 London Olympics.
[260:43.03]They'll be back.
[260:44.79]They'll come to the next one.
[260:54.66]I'm getting really annoyed at this party.
[260:56.49]Why can I not do this?
[260:58.27]I'm just going to fire missiles at them.
[261:12.76]Just shoot him with missiles.
[261:13.66]Can I stand on this?
[261:17.62]Nope, you can't.
[261:18.40]Alright, here we go.
[261:25.84]I need Sandy.
[261:29.05]Finally.
[261:29.47]Alright, now get me the hell over there.
[261:31.47]Alright, let's go.
[261:42.27]Oh, stop.
[261:42.87]Sandy.
[261:44.71]Thank goodness.
[261:52.09]Finally.
[261:52.57]Now let's go.
[261:53.45]Where are they getting spawned from?
[261:58.33]I'm going back.
[261:58.87]I'm gonna go back.
[262:13.62]Do I have to be Spongebob?
[262:16.36]Stop.
[262:18.92]Stop.
[262:19.34]Stop.
[262:19.78]Stop.
[262:20.18]Stop.
[262:20.66]Stop.
[262:21.08]Please.
[262:21.66]Please.
[262:22.02]What the fuck are you doing?
[262:22.92]I'm not... Wait.
[262:23.84]People are yelling at me.
[262:25.02]What do you want me to do?
[262:27.12]Please.
[262:27.60]Please.
[262:28.12]Please.
[262:28.52]I don't know.
[262:29.39]Everyone makes this big speech.
[262:33.69]Okay.
[262:39.63]I have to tell you.
[262:40.25]I have to tell you this.
[262:42.78]This is, I believe, a second or third Nixon resignation speech that you guys have deep faked me on.
[262:55.89]Urge me to do so.
[262:59.73]But the interests of the nation must always come before any personal considerations.
[263:05.61]From the discussions I have had with congressional and other leaders, I have concluded that because of the Watergate matter,
[263:13.80]I might not have the support of the Congress.
[263:15.84]Okay, that was great.
[263:17.72]Thanks.
[263:21.58]How many of those are we going to watch?
[263:30.84]Why is it always Nixon resigning?
[263:33.00]Alright, stop, stop, stop.
[263:38.25]I have to pay attention right now.
[263:40.92]I'm not gonna do this anymore.
[263:42.20]Bullshit.
[263:42.82]I gotta get up here.
[263:43.64]And I gotta pay attention to this.
[263:48.56]Where are they coming from?
[263:51.12]Can I reach that?
[263:52.83]I gotta get up there.
[263:53.83]Wait a minute.
[264:01.19]Can't walk this rope.
[264:03.83]Can I get on the bus stop?
[264:04.78]No.
[264:07.14]No.
[264:13.31]Resign?
[264:13.85]I'm not resigning.
[264:16.19]For what?
[264:16.73]Alright, get on here.
[264:18.09]Finally.
[264:18.69]Wait.
[264:19.22]How do I do that with Sandy?
[264:27.50]Impeach him.
[264:29.08]What?
[264:29.70]What?
[264:44.07]How do I get Sandy up here?
[264:52.67]No, Sandy can't move that, right?
[264:55.04]That's only SpongeBob?
[265:13.43]Does that help me?
[265:17.91]Throw the bubble, then just switch.
[265:19.65]I guess I could try that.
[265:23.51]Will you leave me alone?
[265:24.77]Wait, it doesn't...
[265:43.87]Okay, hold on.
[265:45.67]I thought it went right back up.
[265:47.53]I have to step on it for it to go up.
[265:49.11]Oh my goodness.
[265:50.59]Welcome to fucking hell.
[265:56.93]Now, why couldn't I grab that?
[265:59.35]Well, I tried.
[266:00.26]That didn't even give me an indicator.
[266:02.30]There was no target.
[266:03.54]You watched.
[266:04.46]You watched it happen on your screen.
[266:05.86]I don't have to make anything up.
[266:08.02]I jumped towards it.
[266:08.66]There was no indicator.
[266:09.36]There was no targeting.
[266:12.84]You saw it happen.
[266:14.60]Don't punch me.
[266:15.84]Don't.
[266:16.10]Stop punching me.
[266:19.24]Snipe the generator.
[266:20.00]You got it.
[266:24.47]Okay.
[266:43.31]Alright, here we go.
[266:43.89]Alright, we're going to go over and up.
[267:01.22]Got my cannon right here.
[267:03.40]Can I not do this with Sandy?
[267:06.73]Got to be with Bob.
[267:08.85]Weird calling him Bob.
[267:11.05]Doesn't feel right.
[267:11.77]Alright, come on, Bob.
[267:24.61]Robert.
[267:25.35]Yeah, I'm going to bring Robert over here for a little bit.
[267:31.98]Well, that looks interesting.
[267:33.22]I'll go do it.
[267:37.52]They called him Sponge in the early episodes.
[267:39.56]Did they?
[267:44.47]Close fucking fall.
[267:54.16]Last cannon.
[267:56.09]Oh.
[267:59.43]Good.
[268:02.73]Now all cannons are ready to fire.
[268:04.55]I'll get shot out of the air.
[268:24.84]Should I get the sock or just keep going?
[268:35.23]Where's this button to press?
[268:38.03]Get the sock?
[268:39.69]You think I should?
[268:43.12]Do I really have to carry Patrick's socks?
[269:00.81]Buttons on the other ship.
[269:06.45]How did I listen?
[269:06.89]Do I have to do this all over again?
[269:08.87]I do.
[269:10.97]Do I have to go over there again?
[269:19.47]All because I wanted to go get the sock.
[269:22.19]Alright, get up.
[269:26.79]At least I got the sock.
[269:27.81]That's true.
[269:32.61]across the bridge.
[269:36.69]It's too dangerous.
[269:41.45]Have I ever eaten duck before?
[269:44.31]Once or twice, but I really didn't like it at all.
[269:46.95]I think it's gross.
[269:50.21]I don't like it.
[269:51.13]It's a little... I'm not a fan.
[270:06.01]It's too... It's got a little bit of, like, a gamey taste for me.
[270:10.91]Not into it.
[270:11.45]Plus, I don't like how it's... I know people really like this shit.
[270:18.49]Oh, man, it's so delicious when they... It's like they serve it up, like, they slice it raw, kind of.
[270:23.01]It's, like, just not cooked in the middle.
[270:24.77]It's just, like, seared on the outside.
[270:26.21]It looks like a piece of ahi tuna.
[270:28.47]I don't... I like things fully cooked.

[274:18.17]It looks like just a giant obstacle course with 100 people.
[274:21.34]Is that what it's like or am I wrong?
[274:31.36]When we watched the trailer, we watched it on this channel, I remember going, oh, dude, let's play that.
[274:37.51]So it's out, so, oh, dude, let's play that.
[274:51.62]We have reached time when that's ready to go.
[274:54.42]We're not doing it tomorrow.
[274:57.24]Goodbye.
[275:11.83]It was very easy.
[275:20.52]So what is 71?
[275:23.40]Only four more and I can get to the end of the game.
[275:25.34]I gave him two attacks here.
[275:27.99]Is it 71?
[275:28.97]72?
[275:29.11]71!
[275:29.19]I can feel it.
[275:29.89]It's close.
[275:53.47]How many Bachelors?
[275:54.41]I've missed quite a few.
[275:56.08]Ooh, tanker, ahoy.
[275:58.78]Get aloft there, matey.
[276:01.76]I'm missing two.
[276:11.71]I am sandy right now, though.
[276:13.13]Let me just take a quick look.
[276:20.93]Ooh, tanker?
[276:34.00]Nah, let's go say I want to see the other area.
[276:36.66]I don't want to get like 75 for seeing the other areas I haven't seen.
[276:40.06]What, what, what, what, what?
[276:47.53]Was everybody yelling before?
[276:57.81]He's been doing this lately.
[276:58.83]You've been highlighting my name and yelling.
[277:01.81]What's with the yelling?
[277:04.79]Alright, this bit is the other area.
[277:06.55]The kelp forest.
[277:10.55]Is this the only other zone I haven't been to?
[277:13.45]Channel point.
[277:34.45]all you guys have like 60 million and this is nothing to do with them how many socks do I have alright so I need three socks and three what the hell I'm already dead
[278:01.84]I should probably get rid of that.
[278:02.98]It's only 1200 to do that.
[278:04.76]Some of you guys could sit there and do that.
[278:08.82]All day.
[278:09.16]I probably should just delete channel points.
[278:18.69]You could just store them forever in a vault.
[278:24.31]What's the first thing to do?
[278:28.49]I can also buy one from Mr. Krabs too.
[278:36.63]So I realistically only probably need two.
[278:42.67]Impeach the streamer.
[278:44.05]I feel like I barely played with Patrick the whole game.
[278:48.29]I need more Patrick.
[278:57.84]Emote only.
[278:59.06]Uh-oh, you guys are in trouble.
[279:04.42]The wrath of the gods.
[279:06.56]Oh, it's Mrs. Puff.
[279:12.14]See, Patrick has to go tell SpongeBob to play the game.
[279:19.68]Hey, SpongeBob.
[279:22.04]That lady over there wants to talk to you.
[279:25.02]Thank you, Patrick.
[279:26.14]I appreciate it.
[279:32.03]Third character that doesn't do anything.
[279:34.45]The driving class isn't out here today, is it?
[279:37.62]What a terrible instructor.
[280:09.18]I'll help you find them, Mrs. Puff.
[280:10.54]Thanks, SpongeBob.
[280:11.68]I'll make sure to give you a nice reward when you've found all of them.
[280:15.24]So, you, like, crashed and you're, like, abandoned in the jungle here.
[280:19.78]How the fuck did you have this happen?
[280:24.45]Alright, let's go save all the kids.
[280:29.19]One kid saved.
[280:30.13]Gotta make it up to the other kids.
[280:41.48]What's this?
[280:45.52]Hmm.
[280:47.96]I'm going for it.
[280:56.21]I feel like a new sponge.
[280:57.71]Grandma, have you never driven a car?
[281:05.24]You know, with no road.
[281:07.54]What the fuck?
[281:08.32]Alright, I'm playing the game.
[281:10.74]Hold on, leave me alone for a minute.
[281:15.06]Alright.
[281:24.73]What's up, sock?
[281:27.83]Oh, a camper!
[281:30.55]Ooh, alright.
[281:31.89]I don't see any others over here.
[281:37.77]You can't ignore us.
[281:39.51]I'm not ignoring you.
[281:40.51]I'm just choosing not to listen.
[281:56.46]I want to be Patrick.
[281:57.78]What?
[282:01.81]Are you pretending to be a zero view streamer?
[282:05.45]What?
[282:16.35]It's Spongebob Flatline.
[282:17.81]Yes, for some reason they put that in.
[282:19.25]It's kind of dark.
[282:21.78]I didn't know this game was going to be so dark.
[282:25.74]Okay, gone.
[282:37.35]What?
[282:38.51]You're just floating around.
[282:41.29]Okay, fine.
[282:47.34]Yeah, it is the Half-Life sound.
[282:54.18]I think it actually is.
[282:56.59]These guys suck.
[283:09.11]Please do another time-stamped treasure hunt.
[283:17.78]I think it's a little too late for that.
[283:20.20]I'm not sure I have the ability to do that right now.
[283:48.42]Make it a whole stream?
[283:50.01]Hold on, you want me to huff my gamer chair for a whole stream?
[283:53.49]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[283:55.33]Why are you even saying that?
[283:56.41]I'm not gonna say that anymore.
[284:13.27]Okay.
[284:13.97]I'm not gonna... I'm done with this one.
[284:16.85]Alright, let's go get these things, wherever they are.
[284:20.01]I guess we have to get on the bus.
[284:42.38]Blue stream?
[284:45.85]Oh.
[284:49.93]And we've done stuff like that in the past.
[284:51.83]It kind of doesn't work unless I pre-record the whole thing, though.
[284:57.25]I need that.
[284:57.59]Where is it?
[285:11.35]It's low.
[285:12.43]Just jumped on his head and it just fucking messed up everything.
[285:20.74]Do I have to jump on his head?
[285:28.20]Alright.
[285:32.80]Every stream is pre-recorded.
[285:34.77]Most of them are.
[285:38.96]I need to be Patrick.
[285:40.72]God damn it.
[285:41.32]This is what I'm talking about.
[285:42.38]This is the bullshit I'm talking about.
[285:44.27]I needed to be Patrick.
[286:03.62]The chat's pre-recorded too.
[286:05.74]You sure gotta carry a lot of stuff around.
[286:11.80]You gotta throw that shit.
[286:14.96]Alright, here we go.
[286:22.13]Somebody be in that guy?
[286:23.27]Who's getting, who's getting be in?
[286:39.12]Alright, this is it.
[286:39.58]I'm gonna get the spatula right here.
[286:40.87]Because I've got Patrick!
[286:42.15]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!
[287:09.43]Got it.
[287:11.35]I got it.
[287:12.07]This is it.
[287:12.93]I can do it.
[287:13.47]I need to buy one from Mr. Krabs and then get this one.
[287:19.88]And then I can go and beat the final boss.
[287:21.86]Um, where should I go?
[287:31.26]This level sucks.
[287:32.18]Leave this one.
[287:54.03]He did it.
[287:55.43]Yeah, I'm ready.
[287:57.50]I have- I need three socks.
[287:59.10]Plus, I feel like I've neglected this open world.
[288:03.66]Where's Mr. Krabs?
[288:04.34]How much money?
[288:06.32]Okay, I got 4900.
[288:07.38]How much does it cost?
[288:17.47]Where is he?
[288:28.43]Where's Mr. Krabs?
[288:30.77]Let's buy the Krusty Krab.
[288:37.95]I'm sorry.
[288:38.35]This game's not anatomically correct of where all the things are.
[288:44.23]Where is he?
[288:44.67]There he is.
[288:45.09]Okay.
[288:47.61]Your treasure chest's looking a bit light, boy.
[288:50.79]Do you think I've got bilge water on the brain?
[288:53.67]I ain't running a charity here.
[288:56.15]9,000.
[288:57.01]Alright, well, where have I... Let me go back to one of the first areas.
[289:06.50]Like, how about... Downtown Bikini Bottom?
[289:13.98]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[289:21.53]I'm missing three here.
[289:22.45]I need two more of those wheels.
[289:26.05]Looking for wheels.
[289:33.16]How do I pick that up?
[289:37.42]I see a sock up there.
[289:38.52]Okay, hold on.
[289:54.74]Looking for some shit here.
[289:55.74]What is this?
[289:58.48]I'm looking for a... I need to be sandy.
[290:02.68]Right?
[290:06.84]Sea needle, sea needle.
[290:08.16]There's another level near the graveyard.
[290:09.66]There is?
[290:29.49]Help place, the boats, the dream, and the graveyard.
[290:33.57]There's nothing else here.
[290:34.23]Somebody said that was literally one guy.
[290:44.82]Well, okay.
[290:45.54]What about rock bottom?
[290:48.72]Jellyfish fields.
[290:49.98]Got them all.
[290:52.38]Industrial park.
[290:54.74]Downtown bikini bottom.

[290:59.07]Tom Bucket Lab.
[291:01.45]Hattrick.

[291:18.24]Sea Needle is an area in Bikini Bottom.
[291:22.88]What the hell is the Sea Needle?
[291:30.14]I don't know.
[291:30.60]What's the sea needle?
[291:31.68]What is that?
[291:34.10]It's in downtown.
[291:35.60]Oh, like, oh, go to downtown Bikini Bottom.
[291:38.44]Oh, yeah, cool.
[291:39.32]Where?
[291:40.45]Where's downtown?
[291:41.05]Alright, I'm going to get it.
[291:59.44]So I need to go... Alright, I remember.
[292:03.52]I kind of remember.
[292:04.58]There's a trampoline I have to jump on.
[292:08.47]Where's that trampoline?
[292:14.85]He doesn't remember.
[292:16.37]I'm gonna try.
[292:16.95]I'm using all my brain power to remember where that was.
[292:20.24]It was like a little... little spot.
[292:27.74]People are already upset.
[292:29.96]I'm already getting yelled at.
[292:32.81]It means it must be right here.
[292:34.73]Okay, I told you.
[292:35.53]I knew I thought it was... Look, look, look, look, look, look.
[292:37.73]I got it.
[292:46.77]Shit.
[292:56.06]Alright!
[292:57.70]Sandy can do a chopper.
[292:58.88]I don't have Sandy.
[293:02.52]Where's Sandy?
[293:05.71]Where's the bus?
[293:07.25]I need a bus stop for Sandy.
[293:37.89]These are lamp posts.
[293:39.37]The lamp posts look like bus stops, alright?
[293:47.92]Please don't do this bit.
[293:50.00]Where's the fucking bus stop?
[293:51.66]Why can't it just be at the beginning of the level?
[293:53.48]Why does it have to be a bus stop on a roof?
[293:59.17]Why does it have to be a bus stop up here on the corner on the third roof?
[294:15.48]bus stop.
[294:16.78]You don't need Sandy.
[294:21.22]How am I supposed to get over there?
[294:22.24]This is on the opposite side of the map.
[294:42.33]Just walk around.
[294:45.85]Follow the road.
[295:22.26]Hi, Larry.
[295:27.01]What are the two at the very end?
[295:28.49]There's two that have to be over here.
[295:33.01]What are they?
[295:43.04]Go back to the road.
[295:46.76]You are so close.
[295:48.20]I'm trying.
[295:56.92]I don't know what the needle is.
[295:59.44]I don't watch Spongebob.
[296:00.64]I saw the first like 10 episodes when he was making Krabby Patties.
[296:04.14]I didn't see the episode where he went to the space needle.
[296:06.52]I fucking feel like a space needle like the thing in Seattle.
[296:31.52]Oh gosh, come on.
[296:44.16]That is what it is.
[296:45.04]Why can't I see from the map?
[296:47.08]That's what I'm looking for.
[296:48.94]There you are, boy.
[296:50.61]Someone's broken the sea needle.
[296:53.47]That's horrible.
[296:54.69]The sea needle is the cradle of Crochet Corner.
[296:59.86]Somebody said, how does this guy have 9,000 viewers?
[297:01.62]You have Jerma in your name.
[297:03.62]Get out of here with that bullshit.
[297:04.96]You watch.
[297:05.52]I thought it was something I'm looking for, like a building.
[297:21.98]Mr. Krabs, how can you think of money at a time like this?
[297:25.50]Easy.
[297:26.06]I just clear my mind.
[297:27.86]Money, money, money.
[297:30.31]So what do I have to do?
[297:30.93]Now listen here, boy.
[297:32.53]You know that I'll give you golden spatulas if you bring me shiny objects.
[297:36.61]But I'm going to sweeten the deal.
[297:38.63]If you can break all the tiki's here at the sea needle, I'll give you a bonus golden spatula.
[297:43.83]Easiest thing I've done all day.
[297:44.77]Why would I want to break the tiki's, Mr. Krabs?
[297:49.02]Because they were laughing at you and calling you funny names.
[297:52.53]What kind of funny names?
[297:54.15]Stupid.
[297:55.31]You know, Spongebob butt pants.
[297:58.99]That's not very funny.
[298:01.65]No, but they said your mom was ugly.
[298:04.77]Ugly?
[298:06.21]Alright, Mr. Krabs.
[298:07.55]Break them, I shall.
[298:08.61]You've got a deal.
[298:09.37]Alright.
[298:13.15]Break all the stuff.
[298:15.44]E. Can't go on E.
[298:20.47]Help with you.
[298:23.25]Help with you.
[298:27.80]What's this?
[298:28.84]Oooooh!
[298:36.88]Does this count as breaking shit?
[298:47.48]It does.
[298:47.86]Ooh, wait.
[298:48.90]I gotta... Here we go.
[298:51.49]One last box.
[298:52.25]Did I break it?
[298:56.23]I guess I did.
[299:01.10]Are you guys not like tourists?
[299:02.58]Get out of here.
[299:07.38]What are you doing?
[299:07.88]Leave me alone.
[299:17.11]Here we go, another one.
[299:24.25]Break.
[299:26.99]Why did that hurt?
[299:28.79]Why are these hurting?
[299:33.94]Shouldn't these... It's hard to see.
[299:42.62]It's hard to see.
[299:45.72]It's hard to aim.
[299:54.53]I got it.
[299:59.89]Wait, I need one of those!
[300:00.81]I need one more of these!
[300:03.58]Anybody know where that is?
[300:07.78]I need one more of those fucking things.
[300:11.80]Oh shit.
[300:15.43]Thank you for saving me.

[300:22.38]Just puzzle platform.
[300:48.46]No hit run?
[300:49.18]Well, that would be very, very difficult.
[300:58.81]How do you not get any?
[301:01.33]This is like grabbing with the crane and the one with the candy in it.
[301:04.73]The one that's impossible to lose.
[301:06.89]You just grab a bunch of like... I mean, yeah, the candy in there is gross.
[301:14.38]It's like all Smarties.

[301:16.96]Nobody.
[301:26.48]Smarties are the shit.
[301:27.16]Oh, I like them too.
[301:28.16]But, I mean, you can only have them in small doses.
[301:29.62]You can't have those every time.
[301:39.60]Doses?
[301:40.32]Yeah, I'm saying, like, you can't just eat Smarties.
[301:44.48]Smarties and Tootsie Rolls from, like, 1993.

[305:34.53]Hi, how do you do?
[305:35.59]Allow me to introduce my friends, Patrick, Sandy.
[305:39.25]Enough.
[305:39.65]Prepare to meet your doom.
[306:00.90]Wait, so we have to fight us?
[306:02.94]Spongebob?
[306:03.64]Spongebob's the final boss?
[306:04.97]Spongebob versus Spongebob.
[306:06.95]Okay, wait.
[306:07.29]I see what to do.
[306:07.87]I hit you in the green spot.
[306:28.93]Should I hit Plankton?
[306:41.25]He's bad.
[306:41.57]I'm just learning the encounter.
[306:43.46]I want full HP.
[307:07.34]That does it.
[307:08.36]Spongebob is back in the fight.
[307:11.26]Oh, that was a doozy.
[307:13.86]That does it.
[307:14.90]Spongebob is back in the fight.
[307:16.72]Will you leave me the fuck alone?
[307:17.78]Great barrier reef.
[307:20.03]It looks like Spongebob has an opportunity here.
[307:23.33]That's the ticket.
[307:24.23]Alright, wait till he swings.
[307:26.75]What?
[307:28.11]What?
[307:29.95]Oh, the humanity.
[307:31.59]Or should I say the fish enemy.
[307:34.42]I'm not even hitting this shit.
[307:36.22]Jump!
[307:37.64]It looks like Spongebob has an opportunity here.
[307:40.94]That's the ticket.
[307:49.42]It looks like Spongebob has an opportunity here.
[307:52.97]That's the ticket.
[307:54.37]And the robot is down.
[308:01.63]I know what to do now.
[308:03.99]Let's do it.
[308:04.31]Get out of here.
[308:31.22]Bob?
[308:31.50]Come on, Robert!
[308:55.85]It looks like SpongeBob has an opportunity here.
[308:59.25]Suck it to him, SpongeBob.
[309:00.84]And here he comes.
[309:03.38]Goodbye.
[309:06.88]What?
[309:12.32]I guess SpongeBob won't be winning that way.
[309:15.51]Arati.
[309:16.11]I had a dream about this.
[309:27.23]Alright final phase
[309:52.44]It looks like SpongeBob has an opportunity here.
[309:56.20]Nice move by SpongeBob.
[309:57.94]This match is just about over.
[310:00.22]And... Attack.
[310:14.95]Bye.
[310:17.43]It looks like SpongeBob has an opportunity.
[310:21.40]One more and I have completed SpongeBob and the Battle for Bikini Bottom.
[310:46.17]And... It looks like SpongeBob has an opportunity here.
[310:51.49]76!
[310:51.75]I got a spatula for that?
[310:56.37]Wait, is this phase two?
[310:57.25]Uh-oh.
[311:19.90]Huge and wow, he's got the muscle things Just lifts his fist up and just crushes him What on Earth
[311:57.11]I think we just, this is it.
[311:59.37]This is it.
[312:00.85]He's gonna make it through.
[312:06.77]Watch out for Plankton, he's gonna cause problems.
[312:25.47]Ooh, there it is.
[312:26.63]You gotta get all the, uh, all those things.
[312:31.61]Oh, I ate lots of spaghetti.
[312:33.63]Why are you doing that?
[312:37.80]What?
[312:38.78]Why can I not jump on that?
[312:54.17]Come on, SpongeBob.
[312:55.69]What the hell?
[313:05.24]Where did you even come from?
[313:06.32]I'm trying to get out of the way.
[313:11.40]Wait, I hit it back.
[313:12.76]I didn't even know you could do that.
[313:14.52]It's been like 10 hours.
[313:24.52]Oh!
[313:25.60]You!
[313:29.30]It's time for you to pay.
[313:31.38]We told you to parry.
[313:32.62]Yeah, but you were just making funny jokes.
[313:34.90]I didn't know it was real.
[313:37.00]I like this area though.
[313:45.33]This area is pretty cool.
[313:55.70]Drop him to my death.
[313:57.76]I'm not going to give you an opportunity to do anything.
[314:04.82]Plankton around.
[314:09.78]No.
[314:14.65]Yes, he is.
[314:29.02]You're cheating.
[314:29.60]Is this cheating?
[314:32.00]Sometimes pushing a simple button is the most satisfying.
[314:35.15]Push, push, push, push.
[314:37.65]How is this cheating?
[314:38.37]Nope.
[314:45.57]I gotta knock it back.
[314:47.45]That was a fucking failure.
[314:54.90]Try that again.
[315:06.78]Wow, I didn't even mean to.
[315:08.30]Wow!
[315:09.60]Yeah!
[315:10.38]Huh.
[315:30.40]This is a weird noise streamer.
[315:33.01]I'm sorry, I know.
[315:34.23]What am I gonna tell you?
[315:37.27]I didn't hit.
[315:46.64]Why is the camera doing this?
[315:47.68]What are you doing?
[315:50.08]Stop!
[315:50.46]Stop turning!
[316:01.30]Alright, where's Plankton?
[316:13.28]Do a monkey sound.
[316:15.46]I don't think I can do that on command.
[316:31.27]Almost to the top.
[317:03.55]We actually are at the top.
[317:04.83]This is the top.
[317:12.31]Still going?
[317:20.20]Oh, okay.
[317:21.98]Where is he?
[317:22.44]Alright, what did that do?
[317:44.70]What does Star Wars do?
[317:45.44]Did I get it?
[317:58.04]He's coming for me.
[317:58.72]Don't let him go over here.
[318:03.17]Did I win?
[318:32.79]Time.
[318:33.23]I saw somebody said time.
[318:35.59]10 hours and 18 minutes.
[318:56.09]That was really fun.
[319:01.63]How much is this game?
[319:04.50]What's the price tag on this right now?
[319:05.68]$30?
[319:07.98]That's worth $30.
[319:09.02]Yeah.
[319:09.26]Yeah.
[319:31.79]I didn't do everything.
[319:32.55]I missed, like, obviously, like, 10 to 20 bachelors.
[319:44.00]I enjoyed my time in it.
[319:44.88]I thought it was really fun.
[319:45.54]I thought it was really cute.
[319:46.52]There's some challenging areas for, like, a 12-year-old.
[319:49.06]You know, I had some trouble.
[319:50.49]Oh, yeah?
[319:50.87]I'll show you!
[320:00.74]Well, Plankton, I hope you learned your lesson.
[320:03.10]Oh, I certainly did.
[320:05.68]Next time I'll get it right.
[320:11.14]That's what I would have done in the first episode of the fucking show.
[320:20.11]Need I remind you all that there are still robots out there making a mess of Bikini Bottom?
[320:24.90]Sandy is right.
[320:25.64]I thought she was a squirrel.
[320:28.02]I'm being punished.
[320:29.58]I don't know for what, but I'm being punished.
[320:32.14]This makes me want to watch a bunch of SpongeBob.
[320:35.02]Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy wouldn't stop and neither will I. We can't rest until Bikini Bottom is safe.
[320:46.81]I think they had a really good slide mechanic.
[320:49.37]Alright, that was a positive.
[320:58.18]Oh wait, we get credits!
[320:59.82]Oh!
[321:03.81]I said slide mechanic and look, there's a slide right here!
[321:21.48]Tony Hawk.
[321:22.52]No, this is... Alright, I gotta go.
[321:23.70]I gotta do everything.
[321:27.82]Where's the slide entrance?
[321:28.86]Shit.
[321:31.52]It's okay.
[321:34.19]Alright, here we go.
[321:41.95]Right here.
[321:42.53]Yes.
[321:54.81]Okay, is there a game that's just only slide levels?
[322:05.34]What is it?
[322:07.10]Monkey ball?
[322:08.18]Yeah, monkey ball, right.
[322:11.68]Monkey ball.
[322:12.80]Should I play monkey ball for real?
[322:17.25]And that's another problem.
[322:18.21]Monkey ball, there's like 30 of them.
[322:20.61]And like only two of them are any good, right?
[322:23.56]Have a Dreamcast sitting right there that's ready.
[322:27.52]Can I get the one on Dreamcast?
[322:29.20]The two that are on Dreamcast?
[322:30.26]Or play the new remade ones?
[322:42.16]Play all of them.
[322:44.24]The GameCube.
[322:45.04]Get it on the GameCube.
[322:45.84]GameCube.
[322:46.20]GameCube.
[322:46.54]GameCube.
[322:48.06]The one on Dreamcast is not... That's the original, isn't it?
[323:21.94]Yeah, I love slide levels.
[323:23.10]They're so much fun.
[323:34.82]Arcade as the original GameCube is just the port of the arcade.
[323:40.50]How long would it take to do, like, Super Monkey Ball?
[323:42.92]Like, the GameCube one?
[323:44.27]Would that be a whole stream, or is that only, like, two hours?
[323:53.03]Depends.
[323:55.91]That would be a whole stream.
[323:56.85]Depends on how bad you are.
[324:02.98]Well, you know, that does depend on the day, doesn't it?
[324:13.75]Well, this was a lot of fun.
[324:14.81]I really enjoyed this.
[324:22.35]I'm glad I finally played Spongebob Battle for Bikini Bottom.
[324:27.27]It's been too long.
[324:30.73]I want to get in there.
[324:37.65]Oh, shit.
[324:38.07]I got to do that.
[324:38.95]I got to go down like the chute, right?
[324:40.29]Come on.
[325:00.97]Miss anything else?
[325:02.11]Watch the 100% ending on YouTube.
[325:04.27]Wait, this is a true ending to Battle for Bikini Bottom?
[325:13.82]There is?
[325:24.08]SpongeBob Battle for Bikini Bottom Secret 100% ending.
[325:35.81]Alright, let's check it out.
[325:49.48]Don't stream like a fucking pro.
[325:52.64]Alright, so we saw up to here.
[326:12.39]Well, Plankton, I hope you learned your lesson.
[326:15.47]Oh, I certainly did.
[326:17.37]Next time, I'll get it right.
[326:21.44]Ouch!
[326:21.88]We won!
[326:23.26]Who wants to get ice cream?
[326:25.40]I do!
[326:26.04]I do!
[326:27.32]Plankton, look out!
[326:28.50]Guess you got to see that again.
[326:34.63]What's the difference?
[326:35.15]There's like a minute left.
[327:12.58]Are you ready, kids?
[327:13.24]Aye aye, Captain.
[327:15.90]I can't hear you.
[327:16.54]Aye aye, Captain.
[327:19.45]Oh.
[327:19.81]This isn't right.
[327:22.11]Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?
[327:23.45]SpongeBob SquarePants.
[327:26.49]That's another one.
[327:27.43]They're not children.
[327:28.43]SpongeBob SquarePants.
[327:30.51]If nautical nonsense be something you wish.
[327:33.87]SpongeBob SquarePants.
[327:34.72]Then drop on the deck and flop like a fish.
[327:42.76]Spongebob Squarepants!
[327:44.58]Spongebob Squarepants!
[327:53.05]Hooray!
[327:56.05]There's the true ending.
[327:59.45]Battle for Bikini Bottom.
[328:09.81]Yeah, I don't think I would have spent the next, like, seven or eight hours getting everything to see the theme song played.
[328:18.03]I can watch the theme song on YouTube.
[328:22.53]Still cute, though.
[328:25.47]Should I leave?
[328:34.26]No, of course.
[328:34.90]Did I just ask Twitch chat if I should leave credits
[328:40.54]What am I thinking?
[328:42.58]Of course not.
[328:43.40]Okay, all these people did a really good job.
[328:50.32]This person worked on Plankton.
[328:51.66]This person worked on... Uh... Sandy?
[329:00.26]Gary?
[329:02.18]Annie Puff?
[329:03.18]Larry Homer?
[329:05.51]Scorpon?
[329:06.77]Who are these people?
[329:10.95]Oh, this- those are der- okay.
[329:12.72]Was that like just- oh, that was EU?
[329:34.25]Wait, can we hear all these voices?
[329:38.58]That has to exist in the game, right?
[329:39.90]Can I change my language and just listen to, like, an audio and see what the best SpongeBob is?
[329:44.59]Okay, let's do French.
[330:11.60]And let's just go to the town.
[330:16.81]The credits loop forever.
[330:17.77]Oh, okay.
[330:19.71]Okay, let's go talk and let's just take a look at the voices.
[330:32.20]Okay, here we go.
[330:32.68]Let's see.
[330:33.06]This is French.
[330:33.92]SpongeBob.
[330:34.96]Here we go.
[330:35.30]Not yet, Patrick.
[330:42.63]Not bad.
[330:45.19]It's not bad.
[330:45.77]We need more dialogue, though.
[330:48.89]We need to talk to Squidward.
[330:50.33]I wish Squidward would just speak French in the regular show.
[331:01.14]Okay.
[331:15.95]Italian.
[331:17.59]Okay.
[331:17.85]It's a little more high pitch than Tom Kenny.
[331:20.57]Hold on.
[331:20.85]French was closest.
[331:24.81]Let's see how...
[331:39.02]Sounds a little too smart.
[331:40.26]It's actually not bad.
[331:42.54]It's pretty good.
[331:43.22]It's close.
[331:43.52]Jerma.
[331:43.78]Jerma.
[331:44.86]Patrick sounds close in Jerma.
[332:10.31]This kind of sounds like Bilbo Baggins.
[332:19.67]It's pretty... Look, if you replaced any of... You could replace it with any of these guys and I think it would sound good.
[332:34.00]Okay, hold on.
[332:35.68]Spanish.
[332:37.57]Hola, calamarzo.
[332:39.09]No te he pagado para que te vayas.
[332:40.53]Squidward's freaking fantastic.
[332:42.47]That's fantastic Squidward.
[332:43.75]Hola, calamarzo.
[332:45.17]No te he pagado para que te vayas.
[332:46.61]I love Squidward.
[332:48.73]I love Spanish Squidward.
[332:49.75]Alright, hold on.
[332:58.42]Has encontrado los diez calcetines perdidos?
[333:02.20]Todavía no, Patricio.
[333:04.16]Vaya, y es...
[333:09.37]Okay, I like the Spanish Squidward.
[333:12.17]I like Spanish SpongeBob as well.
[333:17.21]Alright.
[333:17.63]What about Mr. Krabs?
[333:18.43]We're going to see Mr. Krabs, right?
[333:19.93]What about Sandy?
[333:41.36]What about Gary?
[333:42.88]Alright, where's Sandy?
[333:48.49]Alright, nice.
[334:11.26]What else we got?
[334:14.04]Polish.
[334:18.70]Okay.
[334:27.59]Polish Spongebob.
[334:28.73]I wish I... I need more lines for Spongebob.
[334:39.53]Oh, Mr. Krabs.
[334:40.09]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[334:40.55]Hold on.
[334:42.06]Patrick doesn't sound stupid.
[334:43.56]He sounds cool.
[334:44.28]He sounds really cool.
[334:46.24]What about plankton?
[335:08.79]Alright, Mr. Krabs.
[335:09.87]Polish Mr. Krabs.
[335:10.75]It's good.
[335:11.15]It's good.
[335:11.43]Japanese.
[335:11.99]Here we go.
[335:36.44]I like want this in the regular and just like the English game.
[335:54.31]Wait, that's plankton?
[335:56.29]Oh, it's cute.
[336:17.91]And I found the order sheet for your signed robot parts.
[336:22.55]Spongebob sounds pretty good.
[336:24.25]If you don't give it back, I'll use it to pay the tax.
[336:27.70]It's a different take on Plankton.
[336:29.44]You've been fooling me all this time, haven't you?
[336:33.72]Oh, come on!
[336:35.30]You made those robots, haven't you?
[336:36.38]I'll go to the food market and stop the robots and tell everyone!
[336:40.14]That's enough!
[336:40.52]Tell everyone!
[336:45.39]It does seem weird hearing Plankton talk like this.
[336:51.54]Okay.
[336:54.97]There's a lot.
[336:57.91]Jerma plankton.
[336:59.07]Sure.
[337:26.39]Alright, let's do Japanese Patrick.
[338:06.11]You Jerma, Mr. Krabs.
[338:08.21]Polish Squidward.
[338:12.71]Alright, look.
[338:14.05]I'm going to get out of here.
[338:14.89]It's pretty good.
[338:15.55]That's very good.
[338:16.40]It's very good.
[338:16.82]Squidward.
[338:17.26]Alright.
[338:43.84]Alright, alright.
[338:44.24]Jerma Mr. Krabs.
[338:44.82]What, Jerma Sandy?
[338:46.26]I'm gonna do Jerma Sandy and Jerma Mr. Krabs.
[338:48.64]Go to Mermaid Man.
[339:20.76]Japanese Sandy.
[339:22.94]Come for me.
[339:26.88]His Jerma.
[339:27.34]Stop talking and get the robots.
[339:30.59]Alright, Japanese.
[339:39.25]Don't go anywhere.
[339:40.61]Get the robots.
[339:45.59]Don't go anywhere.
[339:46.47]Get the robots.
[339:53.14]They're good.
[339:55.39]They're all pretty close.
[339:56.17]Alright, Jerma Mr. Krabs, and then I'm outta here.
[340:09.49]Your treasure chest looks pretty light, my boy.
[340:11.63]Do you think I'd have Kiel in my brain?
[340:15.05]This isn't a charity event.
[340:16.71]Come back when you have enough shiny objects to exchange.
[340:21.72]You go to Japanese Gary?
[340:25.70]Alright, I'm going to do all language Gary, okay?
[340:34.29]What did he say?
[340:35.37]Jerma Gary.
[340:48.58]I like Jerma Spongebob.
[340:49.74]I wish we could get it.
[340:51.12]With all these different... Alright, Japanese.
[340:52.76]Okay.
[341:20.52]French.
