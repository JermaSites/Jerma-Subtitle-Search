[ve:60.16.100]

[00:07.98]That title sucks.
[00:10.71]I forgot to change the title.
[00:12.51]Hold on.
[00:13.21]One second.
[00:13.73]I'm drawing a blank.
[00:38.79]The VOD is permanently titled this.
[00:41.41]I don't know.
[00:41.87]What should I make it?
[00:42.69]I'm drawing a blank.
[00:48.21]Hmm.
[00:51.69]Call it Saints Row Poo.
[00:55.11]That's worse than this one.
[00:57.74]I got my iced coffee.
[00:58.50]I'm ready to go.
[00:59.96]Sorry about that.
[01:00.50]Had to... Take a phone call.
[01:07.88]the easiest fucking way to get out of anything.
[01:10.14]Because what could that phone call be?
[01:13.20]Was that phone call important?
[01:16.66]Was that phone call somebody you had to talk to immediately?
[01:20.28]You don't know.
[01:21.24]You have no idea.
[01:29.68]No, I'm not, I'm fucking around.
[01:31.35]I've got my wasabi soy sauce almonds here.
[01:36.45]Just in case I need a snack?
[01:38.39]What's wrong?
[01:39.49]I'm fine.
[01:44.63]Soy sauce?
[01:45.17]I actually don't like soy sauce.
[01:48.55]Okay.
[01:49.92]Let's go over what's going on today.
[01:52.30]In the next couple... Maybe a couple weeks.
[01:57.38]So, hold on.
[02:00.38]I gotta move stuff around.
[02:01.16]I just was not fucking prepared at all.
[02:05.31]But like I said, I'm not like all these other streamers.
[02:07.99]Okay?
[02:09.43]It's time for defense here.
[02:11.35]You ready for the defense?
[02:12.23]I've said it a thousand times.
[02:14.45]So when all the other streamers turn their streams on, they usually have like at least 15 to 30 minute countdown before the stream actually starts.
[02:25.73]See, I get here, I just turn it on and fucking I'm not even ready.
[02:29.41]You know, I am the countdown.
[02:31.13]This is the countdown right now.
[02:34.98]It's me.
[02:37.60]I am such an egomaniac, and I'm so full of myself, that even when I'm not supposed to have the stream on, I'm streaming here talking to you as the waiting room.
[02:53.31]Alright, we're gonna play Saints Row 2 today.
[02:57.07]I've never played any of the Saints Row games with an asterisk on it.
[03:02.44]Ster and I played Saints Row 2 for like an hour or two hours or something.
[03:09.10]We got through the character creator and then we just kind of stopped like an hour or two later.
[03:12.52]Though I've never played any of these all the way through or even halfway through or even a third of the way through.
[03:24.04]I remember that video.
[03:25.36]Yeah, we also have a mod.
[03:26.44]I have the Gentleman of the Row mod installed, which I guess fixes the whole game somehow.
[03:38.83]You're a fake fan?
[03:40.75]What do you mean?
[03:42.39]Saints Row 2 is literally the best game ever.
[03:44.25]Okay, well, we'll find out.
[03:49.79]I didn't even tweet this.
[03:52.46]Give me one second.
[03:56.56]I hope everybody had a good Thanksgiving.
[03:59.02]If you celebrated, I did.
[04:04.22]I made a 25 pound turkey.
[04:06.78]Because I wanted to make sure I had leftovers for two or three months.
[04:10.72]Because I freeze, essentially, more than two thirds of the entire bird.
[04:16.66]What is that sound?
[04:19.34]What's going on?
[04:19.80]Am I getting played off the stage?
[04:26.79]What's playing me off the stage right now?
[04:29.35]What's going on?
[04:35.92]Oh shit, this is DMCA music.
[04:37.60]Hold on.
[04:38.82]Why was this not playing earlier?
[04:43.90]This was not playing earlier.
[04:47.82]I've had Saints Row 2 open for 12 straight minutes.
[04:54.87]Audio, music volume.
[04:56.11]Should I turn music volume to zero?
[04:57.19]That's so boring, though.
[05:00.40]Well, that's not boring.
[05:01.16]That's how I live my life.
[05:02.06]Alright, let me turn my fan down.
[05:04.26]It's going pretty hard here.
[05:07.28]But something really important to know is... I didn't even know this was coming out this soon, I guess.
[05:14.60]Monster Rancher 1 and 2 Remake comes out in less than two weeks.
[05:20.30]I hope you guys understand that, whether, whatever you followed this channel for, whether it was for, oh, I like when he does like the big streams.
[05:28.50]No, we're all, that's never happening ever again.
[05:30.84]Once Monster Rancher 1 and 2 comes out, I'm only going to play that game.
[05:34.12]I will fill that category for the rest of the time I stream.
[05:38.44]It's a lie, by the way.
[05:40.20]Plenty of shit planned.
[05:42.82]It's based.
[05:43.60]Yeah, I know.
[05:46.55]Alright.
[05:47.17]No more fucking around.
[05:47.91]No more stalling.
[05:48.47]Let's go.
[05:48.75]Let me tweet.
[05:53.64]Saints Row 2.
[05:59.39]But no, but honestly, all jokes aside, I'm going to play that game a lot.
[06:03.07]I played it a lot when we did the PlayStation 1 stuff.
[06:06.97]But I'm very curious how they're going to handle the CD thing.
[06:11.41]Does anybody know?
[06:12.15]What are they going to do?
[06:15.63]You know what I said?
[06:19.91]And unfortunately, nobody listened to me.
[06:24.82]We have a built-in database.
[06:26.20]It should have been URLs.
[06:29.32]Somebody steal that from me.
[06:30.37]Please.
[06:31.45]But give me 5% of all the revenue of the whole project.
[06:34.83]URLs would have been fucking hilarious, wouldn't it have?
[06:36.75]I don't know.
[06:45.46]Alright, let me just put the link here.
[06:46.80]Okay.
[06:49.60]Mm-hmm.
[06:52.72]Alright, I'm ready.
[06:55.88]You ready to sit for an hour in the character creator?
[06:57.83]Because you know we're going to.
[06:58.93]Because part of this mod increases the body sliders by like 500%.
[07:04.47]So, welcome to the stream.
[07:09.79]Alright, I'm ready to go.
[07:12.18]Okay, here we go.
[07:16.42]New game.
[07:17.32]Is there a... I'm assuming there's probably a...
[07:23.28]Opening cutscene.
[07:23.79]I think there is.
[07:24.21]Alright.
[07:26.95]Hopefully this is not too loud.
[07:28.01]If it's not, let me know.
[07:29.11]If it is, then don't tell me.
[07:30.65]Okay.
[07:31.29]Go.
[07:31.51]I'm not playing on hardcore.
[07:34.15]Why would you play like a GTA game on hardcore?
[07:42.07]You'll never guess who's awake.
[07:43.45]Oh, that hurt my head.
[07:44.31]You're shitting me.
[07:45.83]Come see for yourself.
[07:47.55]How long has it been?
[07:48.67]Years.
[07:49.37]I stopped keeping track a while ago.
[07:50.71]I can't believe it's been that long.
[07:52.87]Time flies when you're watching someone breathe through a tube.
[07:55.88]How's the family?
[07:56.96]It's way too dang.
[07:57.60]My wife's cheating on me with an Altar exec.
[08:00.40]You know, I just found out what that was two days ago.
[08:04.84]She releases a lot of records.
[08:06.90]No shit.
[08:07.72]God, that was a hell of a year.
[08:09.30]Alderman Hughes, Mayor Winslow, Aisha, Chief Monroe.
[08:13.11]All murdered by that asshole who's been sitting in intensive care on taxpayers' money.
[08:18.15]I know, I'll fix it in a minute.
[08:19.61]Lord knows why.
[08:20.89]V's think it's gonna kill the frame rate.
[08:22.09]Couldn't get through.
[08:23.17]The press has been mobbing him with phone calls.
[08:25.07]Oh, about the... I have the Gentleman of the Road mod, which should fix a lot of problems.
[08:31.25]Seeing as they're still breathing after being caught in a massive explosion, I'd say pretty good.
[08:36.92]Coming through!
[08:39.69]We can't even hear you.
[08:46.95]I know my audio.
[08:48.11]I know.
[08:48.54]I'm okay.
[08:50.64]Every time I try to fix my audio system, it fucks up.
[08:53.86]Alright.
[08:54.70]Hold on.
[08:55.99]You understand?
[08:56.73]I always hear... I'm looking over at my OBS right now, and I see the microphone.
[09:00.83]I see, like, the... the waveform, right?
[09:05.30]That, right now, is bright fucking red.
[09:08.58]And if it goes any louder, it's gonna... So I don't understand how to fix it.
[09:16.10]Everybody talks about how quiet I am, but according to my computer, it's fucking, like, barely... If I talk any... If this goes any louder, it's gonna be, like...
[09:24.94]And it's going to blow out your ears.
[09:26.68]It's going to peak.
[09:30.53]I don't get it.
[09:30.91]I don't understand why.
[09:31.75]I think it's this microphone.
[09:32.85]I think this microphone is a really good mic.
[09:35.07]But I don't think it was ever designed to be plugged in to do what I'm doing.
[09:41.96]Clip that noise.
[09:42.92]Don't do that.
[09:44.48]Idiot.
[09:45.32]You idiot.
[09:46.40]Okay, hold on.
[09:47.02]Let me turn the game down a little.
[09:51.68]This should be good right there.
[09:52.54]Okay.
[09:53.74]So, we have to figure out, what do I want to do with this?
[09:55.78]Okay, uh, I'm going to try to make me.
[10:01.40]No, not exit.
[10:05.58]Holy shit, this is a dick.
[10:06.82]No, it's not.
[10:07.96]Oh my god.
[10:10.62]Right, right, okay, we're fine.
[10:17.36]Okay.
[10:20.36]Hold on.
[10:24.60]So the sliders have been increased by about two to three hundred percent.
[10:28.64]This is current Jerma, yeah.
[10:29.72]Alright, wait a minute.
[10:34.11]How come it's giving me these, okay, why is it, where's the button prompts?
[10:37.61]Alright, body shape.
[10:45.89]Okay.
[10:51.05]I feel, this is just, I feel like I'm in a Ninja Turtle costume.
[10:55.03]I don't know why.
[10:55.65]Why am I seeing that?
[11:00.59]I don't get it.
[11:01.13]Why did I just say that?
[11:08.43]How much age should we have?
[11:12.13]I don't want to go too overboard because we have to live with this for the whole rest of the entire time I play this game.
[11:18.17]You just made E Honda.
[11:23.17]Should he be jacked fat?
[11:25.51]No, I can't just put all the sliders to the right.
[11:28.22]That's so easy.
[11:51.49]Cone head.
[11:52.63]I can't.
[11:54.29]This is the back of the head?
[11:55.19]I'm just gonna make like a fucking banana split head.
[12:01.38]Tyler 1.
[12:11.45]Oh, sorry, excuse me.
[12:12.17]What you meant to say is, uh, you didn't mean to say Tyler Wen.
[12:14.72]What you meant to say was one of the greatest Twitch interactive entertainers on the platform.
[12:18.84]That's what you meant to say.
[12:20.64]Make sure you get it right next time.
[12:28.36]Oh my goodness.
[12:31.16]That's not my hair, that's my head.
[12:35.97]Where's the brain?
[12:39.25]I don't know.
[12:39.77]I don't think it exists.
[12:40.65]Is this the neck?
[12:42.83]Hold on.
[12:47.03]Looks like somebody's cutting down a tree.
[12:49.67]I'm the trunk.
[12:53.81]I don't know if I like that.
[12:55.23]I have to change that, I think.
[12:56.09]Alright, should I make his head a serving platter?
[13:04.50]Like a gravy boat?
[13:05.28]Because that's what's happening.
[13:10.04]I mean, it just was Thanksgiving.
[13:17.11]Oh my God.
[13:19.23]He's wearing a baseball bat, a baseball hat of his own head.
[13:22.37]A baseball bat?
[13:23.17]He's wearing a baseball hat of his own head.
[13:24.95]I said that wrong, but you know what I mean.
[13:30.73]Somebody can ride his head?
[13:35.45]How wide?
[13:36.35]Should it be not that wide?
[13:41.60]I like it like this.
[13:42.73]At least for now.
[13:43.35]I might have to go back and fix it, though.
[13:49.19]This is just Peter Pettigrew.
[13:58.03]He's so mad.
[14:05.52]Well, now he is.
[14:06.06]I kind of like it like this.
[14:15.43]Maybe we'll reduce the weight.
[14:17.19]Maybe we'll reduce the fatness.
[14:22.56]Ooh, I like that.
[14:23.30]It's scary.
[14:28.08]Big and bushy?
[14:29.20]Or small and scary?
[14:30.48]What do you think?
[14:33.22]It's the guy that can survive the car crash.
[14:38.40]It is.
[14:39.04]What was that guy's name?
[14:40.05]What was it?
[14:41.61]What was that guy's name?
[14:44.70]It was the thing they made in the CG program that could actually survive a car crash.
[14:48.90]It had like a gram.
[14:50.32]That's right.
[14:51.22]Hold on.
[14:54.14]Yeah, I can't alt tab this game because it breaks.
[14:56.29]Look up gram.
[14:57.35]Car crash.
[15:02.95]I like that.
[15:08.38]I think angry is better though.
[15:10.06]I want to see the eyes.
[15:10.64]I don't want to lose the eyes.
[15:14.83]Real tragedy.
[15:15.71]No, I'm not saying look up this person that, whatever.
[15:22.25]It actually is Peter Pettigrew now.
[15:28.75]Well, it would make sense to make that person because I'm probably going to get in a bunch of car crashes.
[15:38.00]No, I didn't say look up car crash on Google.
[15:40.04]I said look up car crash Graham.
[15:43.33]It's a very specific thing to look up.
[15:49.49]Alright, that's okay.
[15:50.45]Eyes, this is important.
[15:51.21]I can't.
[16:02.42]It looks like he could survive.
[16:03.42]Hmm.
[16:11.19]Randomize?
[16:11.67]I don't want to randomize it.
[16:16.29]He has a part in his hair.
[16:17.45]Yeah, the part is a little bit further back on his skull.
[16:25.89]That's so weird.
[16:26.92]Okay, we'll keep that.
[16:27.88]No, we won't.
[16:28.32]How about this?
[16:29.52]No.
[16:36.22]Really deep eyes.
[16:38.20]I have eyes like this.
[16:46.68]I kind of like it.
[16:48.32]Not that low, though.
[16:49.90]I want to be able to see all these features.
[16:52.20]I do?
[16:52.50]Yeah, I have really deep set eyes.
[16:54.86]They go really far back.
[17:00.67]Yeah, my eyes are so far back, set into my head, that they're kind of close to my brain.
[17:05.15]So, if I kind of push in my eyes very gently, like the last episode of SpongeBob plays.
[17:10.98]It's just like, Patrick!
[17:13.02]Like, weird shit happens.
[17:17.83]Like, I'm pushing on, like, the frontal lobe of my brain when I do it.
[17:23.29]Like, okay, I'm gonna do it.
[17:25.51]Someone was just speaking French.
[17:26.67]There was a guy just speaking French.
[17:28.27]Holding, like, a big dinner plate.
[17:29.67]He was, like, serving it.
[17:30.27]I don't know.
[17:43.21]Let me work on my guy, please.
[17:47.54]This is what you look like.
[17:49.90]Why do you... You don't think I know that?
[17:51.40]Oh, boy.
[18:02.38]No, I want to see the eyes.
[18:03.35]Maybe not that big.
[18:06.35]Like this.
[18:11.85]Give him anime eyes.
[18:12.91]Oh.
[18:19.47]Stop being rude?
[18:21.33]Oh, you're talking about other people, not me.
[18:22.55]Okay, ears.
[18:26.11]Should you just not have ears?
[18:29.03]Maybe you just shouldn't have them.
[18:42.15]Alright, those ears are where a fish's ears are.
[18:46.04]No, that's where a bird's ears are.
[18:48.12]That's fine.
[18:48.58]I like it.
[18:55.87]Ears are cringe anyways.
[18:56.94]Get rid of them.
[18:57.94]What?
[19:02.78]That's fine.
[19:05.32]No, that's alright.
[19:06.14]Like that.
[19:09.36]Ear openness.
[19:14.34]That's weird.
[19:19.17]Ear roll?
[19:19.75]No, I don't want to mess with the ears too much.
[19:22.59]It's messing with the hair.
[19:27.32]Just really huge lobes?
[19:28.72]No.
[19:33.51]An elf.
[19:36.01]Make him an elven?
[19:44.69]I kind of like the elven.
[19:49.37]Maybe not that extreme.
[19:54.60]It's a wood elf.
[19:59.28]Okay.
[19:59.98]Cheekbones.
[20:08.30]Hmm.
[20:09.04]Maybe not that much.
[20:09.78]How about temple depth?
[20:10.82]What is that doing?
[20:11.28]Temple height.
[20:18.53]I like it higher.
[20:23.07]That's not bad.
[20:24.37]No, no, no, no.
[20:24.71]It's definitely going to be over here somewhere like here.
[20:31.37]Cheekbone depth?
[20:32.93]No, way too.
[20:33.67]Put him in.
[20:36.51]That's not bad.
[20:37.05]Maybe a little bit out.
[20:37.55]That's fine.
[20:39.49]High cheekbones or low?
[20:43.27]That's alright.
[20:48.77]Why does he look like Cartman?
[20:52.79]It does look like Eric Cartman.
[20:57.22]Yeah, just wait for when South Park does all grown up like the Rugrats did.
[21:01.48]And this is what they're going to get.
[21:10.77]They just did that.
[21:11.89]They did?
[21:13.71]Oh, shit.
[21:15.15]I did not know that.
[21:16.51]They're literally doing that right now.
[21:18.43]They just did that.
[21:19.93]They did that literally, literally in the new special.
[21:23.46]Does he look like this?
[21:31.58]I don't want these to be that.
[21:32.58]No, no, no.
[21:32.97]Pull these back.
[21:33.89]That's like way too comical.
[21:35.25]You know what I mean?
[21:37.19]Like, oh, this is so funny.
[21:38.25]No, no, no.
[21:38.83]That's too comical.
[21:39.91]It needs to be a little bit dialed back here.
[21:46.21]The chin is messed up too.
[21:47.37]That's got to get fixed.
[21:48.05]Okay.
[21:55.35]Nose.
[21:55.51]Nose.
[22:01.15]Big or small nose?
[22:02.11]Probably small.
[22:03.17]We want the other features in the face to really, really pop.
[22:10.73]Yeah, small.
[22:11.27]No, no, no.
[22:11.83]Not big.
[22:21.21]He has extra nostrils.
[22:27.87]No, that's too comical.
[22:30.50]I think, like, right where it was is good.
[22:38.71]I like that.
[22:39.19]Alright, now imagine if I could take this guy into Dark Souls.
[22:48.69]That would be great.
[22:50.09]I feel like that's what I'm doing.
[22:50.93]Put it up high?
[22:57.31]No, no, no, no.
[22:58.11]Not high.
[23:03.58]It looks like the imprint of somebody's shoe is on the front of his face.
[23:08.50]Like this guy had a normal face and then like in a Tom and Jerry cartoon, somebody with a boot came and kicked him in the face as hard as they could.
[23:16.67]That's the imprint of a shoe from the forehead to the chin.
[23:30.63]We don't got to get too finicky with the nose.
[23:35.05]Looks like Trump.
[23:35.69]It looks like a Trump caricature.
[23:51.63]No, I don't like what that just did.
[23:56.99]No, I don't like what that did either.
[23:58.29]Right here in the middle.
[23:58.85]Keep it in the middle.
[24:06.02]His nose is way too pushed in.
[24:09.46]To have any of these other settings mean anything.
[24:11.64]At all.
[24:14.60]Alright, that's fine.
[24:15.80]Mouth.
[24:19.30]He just doesn't have any teeth.
[24:23.26]He just has no teeth.
[24:26.60]I like it.
[24:36.12]That's okay.
[24:41.38]It's just grandma.
[24:42.21]It's like an open mouth.
[25:02.18]Not that.
[25:02.58]No, no, no.
[25:02.92]Not like this.
[25:03.86]Like this.
[25:05.66]Just the two lips.
[25:11.16]That's okay.
[25:11.74]A little bit lower down is fine.
[25:17.89]That's right.
[25:19.81]It's just a fish.
[25:21.47]I feel like I didn't touch anything, but I feel like they're having trouble standing.
[25:24.03]Are they swaying and moving weirdly to anybody else?
[25:26.01]I feel like they're having trouble here.
[25:29.39]Were they doing this the whole time?
[25:34.35]I don't think so.
[25:40.23]Okay.
[25:42.31]That's fine.
[25:43.91]Oh, wait.
[25:44.27]They're not supposed to have teeth.
[25:46.05]This is the I don't have teeth mouth.
[25:48.45]But they're showing teeth.
[25:49.99]That doesn't make any sense anymore.
[25:55.54]Hey!
[25:55.72]How about the other way?
[25:58.74]Oh, no.
[26:04.26]This is slowly becoming a sus image, isn't it?
[26:08.74]No.
[26:09.04]It's gotta be like that.
[26:10.38]With a big undervite.
[26:16.95]Alright, this is fucked up, because I feel like this person, if the boogers just go right into their mouth, that's fucked up.
[26:31.84]If this person's asleep on the train, and they have a runny nose, they're just pulling the runny nose directly into their mouth.
[26:44.92]Okay, I think that's fine.
[26:46.80]Maybe not that extreme.
[26:47.94]Maybe.
[26:48.80]That's too extreme, you think?
[26:52.72]That's fine.
[26:53.20]Like that.
[27:01.52]Oh, I don't want to look at that for the next, like, six hours.
[27:03.41]No.
[27:03.71]Like this.
[27:10.45]I don't hate that.
[27:15.37]This is hard to look at.
[27:16.43]Yeah, that's why I don't want it to be that extreme because we have to look at this for a long time.
[27:20.43]We have to look at this for a while.
[27:32.44]Double chin?
[27:33.04]I mean, there is no double chin.
[27:35.30]There's one single bullfrog chin.
[27:38.38]It's not double.
[27:47.20]We're past the point where there's a double.
[27:51.48]Alright, almost done.
[27:59.37]Should I just make him a beanbag chair?
[28:00.71]I don't know.
[28:13.04]Jaw height?
[28:13.72]Oh, you can pull it up.
[28:16.89]Yeah, but his head, his chin is going into his body.
[28:23.50]Leave this poor man alone.
[28:24.56]Is that too much?
[28:26.90]I don't know.
[28:28.88]I feel like that's too much.
[28:35.91]He made Patrick Star unavailable.
[28:43.12]Oh.
[28:44.48]Oh.
[28:46.67]Alright, hold on.
[28:47.05]What about the hair?
[28:51.73]Wait, hold on.
[28:54.99]Oh, no.
[29:04.91]It can't be Patrick Star, though.
[29:06.67]That's not... It's gonna be... That's funny for right now.
[29:09.47]You think it's funny right now.
[29:10.65]Let's make him Grimace instead.
[29:13.07]I like Grimace better than Patrick Star.
[29:16.17]It's Majin Buu.
[29:16.99]I know, but we all think this is like funny for like the next 10 minutes.
[29:21.30]But after he's purple grimace for four hours, I don't think we're going to think it's funny anymore.
[29:27.26]It's like a one-minute joke.
[29:30.38]It's funny right now.
[29:38.43]Mr. Greens?
[29:42.21]No, they can't.
[29:44.27]Keep Grimace.
[29:45.61]Okay, fine.
[29:46.59]I'll keep it as Grimace.
[29:48.27]I like Grimace the most out of all these.
[29:49.77]It's going to be just distracting.
[29:55.48]If it's Grimace, he has to lose the hair.
[29:56.96]Hold on.
[29:59.84]I am not committing yet.
[30:11.41]Facial hair?
[30:12.07]No.
[30:14.60]Okay, here we go.
[30:33.65]First lady?
[30:36.95]That's just on this guy.
[30:38.29]It's Elvis.
[30:56.23]Half of these just look like coral reefs on him.
[30:59.17]They're so all, look at this.
[31:01.45]This looks like a coral reef.
[31:03.96]This doesn't even look like hair.
[31:11.20]This looks like underwater sea creature.
[31:21.62]Okay, if I showed you this image.
[31:24.00]Right here.
[31:25.43]And I asked you, what is this?
[31:28.57]What is this image?
[31:30.93]What would you say?
[31:31.45]You'd probably say some deep sea thing.
[31:42.10]Okay, I think we found it.
[31:48.56]This is a sea cucumber.
[31:56.14]cabbage it actually kind of does look like cabbage you're right there's so many this one's good but if we have if we're going to commit to grimace it can't grimace doesn't have hair I mean technically grimace is covered in hair
[32:32.94]There's so many options.
[32:35.57]Wait, let's go back to the top.
[32:37.99]We started in the middle.
[32:40.83]He looks like a geode.
[32:41.75]I mean, this is the easy one if it's Grimace, but it can't be.
[32:47.09]I'm going back.
[32:47.61]He's not going to be Grimace.
[32:51.92]Beehive?
[33:04.92]Oh, okay.
[33:11.79]I like this one.
[33:14.49]I like this one.
[33:15.71]We're keeping this one.
[33:21.51]None of the facial hair is going to show up.
[33:37.35]No, no facial hair.
[33:38.45]I feel like he's about to start singing a Smash Mouth song.
[34:10.00]Yeah, like, right now.
[34:11.92]No, no facial hair.
[34:12.82]No sideburns.
[34:13.44]I actually like that.
[34:15.88]Yep.
[34:17.30]It's Elvis.
[34:17.72]It's Elvis.
[34:18.10]It's Elvis.
[34:18.44]It's Elvis.
[34:18.78]It's Elvis.
[34:19.14]It's Elvis.
[34:19.68]I made it.
[34:20.00]I'm done.
[34:20.84]It's gonna be Elvis.
[34:31.75]Austin Powers?
[34:35.49]Okay, hold on.
[34:36.21]Evil Scientist.
[34:39.42]I'll take full.
[34:41.86]Alright.
[34:43.40]Hold on.
[34:46.36]I need... I gotta get this right.
[34:48.72]Let me see what he looks like when he's not purple Grimace.
[35:03.44]We'll fix the hair.
[35:06.57]It's just Fat Bastard from Austin Powers.
[35:08.91]Fuck, it has to be Grimace now.
[35:12.37]But that's, no, I can't do just, look, he's purple.
[35:18.40]I don't want it to be purple.
[35:29.42]No, no, we're going back.
[35:30.86]I'll get sick of the Grimace joke in 20 minutes.
[35:36.36]I'm gonna fix this.
[35:53.33]Okay.
[35:54.41]I actually don't hate this.
[35:58.27]I don't hate this.
[36:02.24]Wait, why does he have a purple fade?
[36:06.83]Is there purple like highlights?
[36:11.64]What?
[36:16.86]Oh, it's because the secondary color.
[36:34.38]no this doesn't look like oh my god this does not somebody said this looks like Adam driver what are you talking about how do you see Adam driver Adam driver is like a handsome like dashing man what are you talking about
[37:01.63]I don't see it.
[37:02.33]I don't.
[37:03.87]I like this, though, because... We're gonna keep it like this.
[37:08.31]I think it's perfect.
[37:10.23]That's not Adam Driver.
[37:11.25]It's not at all.
[37:12.29]I don't even know where you're getting that from.
[37:13.35]I don't know how so many people are... I don't know how many so many people are agreeing with you.
[37:19.56]So many people are saying Jay Leno, Dan Schneider.
[37:24.34]People are...
[37:30.52]No, this is not Gabe Newell.
[37:39.27]Orson Welles.
[37:40.15]Okay, this is... Everyone has... Alright, let's keep this for now, I think.
[37:44.27]I need to keep this.
[37:47.73]These gangs have no idea who they're dealing with.
[37:51.05]I think we're going to... British accent?
[37:52.79]Keep making him British.
[37:53.47]Yeah.
[38:10.33]It's Snape.
[38:12.63]It is Snape.
[38:13.03]I like Snape the best.
[38:40.86]Okay.
[38:53.72]Everybody, stop talking.
[38:57.28]We have like the soy face.
[39:00.44]Right?
[39:02.80]I'm just going to put this on top of me reviewing the new PS5 controller.
[39:08.29]These are all just thumbnail faces.
[39:10.37]See, what you guys don't know is most YouTubers just sit there in front of their webcam and go like this.
[39:17.12]In about maybe two to three minutes.
[39:19.81]And that's what they've been using on every thumbnail for the last five to ten straight fucking years.
[39:25.65]They've never edited them.
[39:26.71]They've never updated them.
[39:30.71]Are you... Can I really be, you know, inclined to think that you're, like, very, very scared of something?
[39:38.68]If that's an image that you were scared... This is the same, I was scared of this game, or this movie, or this TV show, or this thing, like, seven years ago?
[39:46.84]How do I know that you're scared?
[39:49.79]You may have been scared when you made this, but not... You're just pasting it on everything else.
[39:59.65]Oh, no, no, no, sorry, that's not accurate.
[40:01.49]They don't have the looking up towards the ceiling with your eyes, with your finger on your chin, thinking about something.
[40:07.04]Isn't that interesting?
[40:11.32]They forgot that one.
[40:17.53]I think blank is the best.
[40:23.27]This is taking shots.
[40:26.16]No, no, I'm not.
[40:26.98]Who?
[40:27.30]Okay, taking shots.
[40:29.00]I'm the guy that's standing outside screaming.
[40:33.97]Like, okay, you know when you go to like a convention where you go to something and there's like a person that's like screaming about God outside?
[40:39.41]It's just like, who is this person?
[40:47.16]Like, I am that person.
[40:49.28]Everybody else is looking at me like, what the fuck are you talking about, dude?
[40:51.98]Everybody does this shit.
[40:55.37]Dude, dopey, please.
[40:56.95]Ugh.
[41:04.49]Fine.
[41:14.70]Oh, nice.
[41:15.48]Okay.
[41:22.20]Oh, this... I love the...
[41:26.45]This one's really bouncy.
[41:27.39]This one's very bouncy.
[41:30.87]What was that?
[41:35.31]I think we may have found it.
[41:39.27]Not quite, though.
[41:41.54]Zombie?
[41:42.06]He looks like a big baby.
[41:46.20]This is a big baby.
[41:47.38]I don't like this at all.
[41:48.06]I have to move on now.
[41:49.92]Ugh!
[42:04.07]Gangsta lean.
[42:05.77]O2 tank pull?
[42:14.70]Wasted?
[42:19.19]Slow and steady.
[42:20.77]Oh, yeah.
[42:21.67]Yep.
[42:22.55]I don't need to see any more.
[42:24.45]No, I don't have to see any other ones at all.
[42:28.41]Read the news.
[42:32.76]Carry books?
[42:36.27]Carry clipboard?
[42:38.08]Metal detector?
[42:38.92]Do you actually walk around like this?
[42:45.44]Out shopping.
[42:49.48]Keepin' dry.
[42:51.10]Or laundry day.
[42:55.13]I think it has to be this one.
[42:57.49]Or this one.
[42:58.37]No, no.
[42:59.19]This, I like... I'm not gonna... Do I move?
[43:04.01]How do I do this?
[43:04.57]Okay.
[43:05.33]Okay.
[43:07.88]No, I like this one.
[43:08.70]This one's better.
[43:10.66]You do understand that there's so much opportunity for me to make a laugh out loud joke where there's a car coming and I do this into the road and get hit?
[43:17.18]Are you serious?
[43:17.72]You don't think I'm going to pick this one?
[43:19.62]This is the easy one.
[43:27.76]Combat style.
[43:29.60]There's only one.
[43:31.84]Compliment.
[43:32.78]Nice job.
[43:35.22]Yeah!
[43:35.96]Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.
[43:38.22]Don't worry.
[43:39.04]I'm not going to kill you.
[43:41.86]Slow kisses.
[43:44.75]As long as I'm around, no one's going to fuck with you.
[43:58.04]Guitar.
[44:00.56]There's no music.
[44:02.94]And a good day to you.
[44:08.54]Take a photo?
[44:10.50]Oh, I see.
[44:11.04]Okay.
[44:17.15]Ugh.
[44:17.79]This one's probably the... Okay.
[44:20.13]Um... Oh, the harmonica.
[44:21.17]The jig is good, too.
[44:45.29]Okay, I guess we're gonna use the harmonica.
[44:46.71]Yeah, blues is more dynamic.
[44:55.62]Taunt.
[44:56.00]Okay, what do we got?
[44:57.98]Bring the voodoo.
[44:58.94]Chest bump.
[44:59.24]Come get some.
[44:59.66]Eat takeout.
[45:12.81]I mean, this one works for this character, but... Eat the dead?
[45:16.87]Oh.
[45:20.79]What, I can eat them on the ground?
[45:21.99]I like this one a lot, but I don't think it fits.
[45:41.07]Sword?
[45:41.33]Oh.
[45:41.55]Wait, it doesn't actually wrap?
[45:43.17]Nope.
[45:44.19]Nope.
[45:44.37]Wait, that was Harry Potter.
[45:47.79]That's Voldemort.
[46:11.12]That's a pretty good Voldemort scream.
[46:12.52]Is he smoking?
[46:19.03]Is that a cigarette?
[46:19.97]Okay, it's a cigarette.
[46:21.09]How about the wanker?
[46:22.63]Oh, okay.
[46:26.15]What the fuck?
[46:31.11]Oh!
[46:47.19]What?
[46:48.97]It either has to be vomit or the fire breather.
[46:55.71]No, I'm not going to do the default taunt from GTA Online, please.
[46:59.49]I think we're ready.
[47:10.54]Okay, we did everything, right?
[47:12.40]Let me make sure this is right.
[47:13.18]Okay.
[47:14.04]Body.
[47:15.14]I don't think anything else needs to happen.
[47:19.72]Alright.
[47:19.98]Are you guys ready to play the game?
[47:21.68]I am.
[47:24.72]Eat takeout.
[47:25.32]I don't even know how to do any of these things.
[47:29.17]Time to go.
[47:36.39]Wait.
[47:37.01]No, okay.
[47:37.35]No, no.
[47:37.89]Yeah.
[47:38.05]No.
[47:39.93]Three, two, one, go.
[47:41.15]Oh my god.
[48:04.07]This is why I couldn't be Patrick.
[48:05.03]I feel like I'm watching Gumball.
[48:05.98]Like these two are from different animation styles and different complete art styles.
[48:28.74]It shows that you're dumb enough to let yourself get stabbed.
[48:31.50]I'm trying to help you.
[48:32.80]You know what I got the last time I trusted someone?
[48:35.36]Blowing the fuck up.
[48:36.86]You need me.
[48:38.19]The hell I do.
[48:39.13]I got the sights.
[48:41.01]Sure you do.
[48:42.05]What's that supposed to mean?
[48:44.12]Why does the voice fit him?
[48:44.96]It does.
[48:45.62]I don't know.
[48:45.98]It just does.
[48:46.27]I think that's by design.
[48:46.87]Those little shoes.
[49:14.55]What?
[49:14.99]Why am I floating?
[49:24.72]Okay.
[49:26.26]Punch and block.
[49:28.90]Okay.
[49:31.68]That's not correct.
[49:36.25]Three successful strikes will devastate a combo.
[49:38.77]Alternate.
[49:39.41]Okay.
[49:39.79]I need to find out what that is.
[49:41.89]Okay.
[49:42.07]That's jump.
[49:44.84]Okay, right trigger is punch.
[49:47.22]Left trigger is another kind of punch.
[49:50.38]Wait, what did I just do?
[49:59.96]I have to kill the doctor first.
[50:01.30]Okay, play the tutorial, sure.
[50:13.51]Ow!
[50:14.79]Alright, what's block?
[50:15.95]Okay, you can hold the button down, but what's block?
[50:19.19]There was a block.
[50:19.79]Alright, that's like my... Right bumper?
[50:26.81]E is kick door, but that's not what it is.
[50:28.37]Okay, it's, uh, why?
[50:30.69]Let's go!
[50:31.33]Punch, punch, punch!
[50:32.27]Holy shit.
[50:50.56]Use R?
[50:51.28]What was R?
[50:54.52]Oh, the weapon wheel.
[50:55.18]Okay.
[50:58.42]Alright.
[51:01.94]I thought the mod gave Xbox 360 controls.
[51:05.08]Maybe not here?
[51:06.38]I know there's a sprint.
[51:07.96]What is it?
[51:08.50]What are you going to do when you get out of here?
[51:18.76]Alright, crouch.
[51:22.56]Okay, let's push in.
[51:24.96]Let's sprint.
[51:26.08]Left bumper?
[51:27.46]Right bumper?
[51:28.10]Okay, nice.
[51:28.54]Thank you.
[51:29.74]Thank you.
[51:31.54]This is your mini-map.
[51:33.51]Markers and GPS navigation lines here will guide you to objectives.
[51:37.39]Set GPS waypoints.
[51:38.39]Okay, this is a map.
[51:39.49]Of course, there's a pause menu, right?
[51:43.72]Ooh, this is huge.
[51:46.23]Holy shit.
[51:47.73]Okay, let's go.
[51:50.73]Kill the guard and take their gun.
[51:53.25]Is there a sneak?
[52:02.14]Okay, not really.
[52:02.76]Did I get the gun?
[52:05.64]Okay, running over weapons you don't have automatically picks them up.
[52:08.44]Change your weapon, press and hold Q. That's easy, I already have that.
[52:13.80]Okay.
[52:17.79]Melee bash or fire gun?
[52:19.93]Okay, good.
[52:20.61]Good to know.
[52:20.87]Alright, let's go.
[52:31.07]Oh my god, that was horrible.
[52:34.17]Was I not supposed to do that?
[52:36.84]Was I not supposed to do that?
[52:38.96]I don't know.
[52:44.81]Why would I kick him, like, in the balls?
[52:48.63]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[52:50.67]Wait, that's a new gun.
[52:56.08]Use R. Don't shoot me.
[52:59.64]What?
[53:01.82]Oh, wait.
[53:05.02]Dual wield?
[53:05.40]Can I?
[53:13.67]Is it Y?
[53:14.17]Oh, shit.
[53:15.47]Oh, well.
[53:15.71]It's okay.
[53:16.51]I'll figure it out.
[53:21.81]Oh, fuck.
[53:24.67]We just gotta run.
[53:25.34]We just gotta get out of here.
[53:26.16]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[53:29.14]Is it... Can you do weld?
[53:31.60]I don't think you can do weld.
[53:33.74]R to do weld?
[53:34.30]Yeah, but it's using the... It's not giving me controller props.
[53:38.29]Okay.
[53:41.89]Fine aim is V, which is, I'm assuming it's probably... Let's see.
[53:46.90]Okay, fine aim is right on the stick.
[53:56.80]What the fuck?
[53:57.60]Why did it, why would it explode?
[54:03.16]I'm, okay.
[54:11.72]Alright, let's get to the dock.
[54:14.16]Sprint.
[54:14.70]Yep.
[54:16.40]Thanks to chat, I know how to do that.
[54:23.40]Oh.
[54:27.17]Let's get to the docks.
[54:33.51]How do you drive?
[54:35.21]Oh, fuck.
[54:35.63]It's, wait.
[54:36.11]It's A?
[54:40.16]It's A and... I think I have to change this.
[54:44.26]I have to change this.
[54:44.84]Get out.
[54:56.98]I remember this happening.
[55:00.92]That's how Saint Row 2 works on console?
[55:03.66]Oh, fuck.
[55:04.34]Okay.
[55:08.29]Defend the boat.
[55:09.89]From what?
[55:19.33]Does this thing overheat?
[55:25.31]Helicopter.
[55:28.82]I got it.
[55:33.26]Two pistol shots makes it smoke and explode, but I can't take this out for the life of me.
[55:41.68]Oh, wait, I gotta reload.
[55:42.88]Podler aim?
[55:49.67]It's hard on a controller.
[55:50.93]Give me a break.
[55:57.37]Where's the music?
[55:59.42]I turned the music off because people said there was DMCA.
[56:12.05]Okay, that's good.
[56:14.41]Alright.
[56:15.19]What do you mean, don't let them catch us?
[56:17.55]There's nobody here.
[56:18.29]Oh, it's the helicopter.
[56:23.92]Okay, well, I can't... Oh my god, I gotta... Just put on Christmas music.
[56:35.36]That's a really, actually brilliant idea.
[56:39.40]Just put on like a royalty-free Christmas music playlist.
[56:42.12]A very Kevin MacLeod Christmas.
[56:46.07]Ludwig's Christmas album.
[56:47.67]Oh, yeah.
[57:06.24]We're gonna find the other Saints.
[57:08.84]What other Saints?
[57:10.16]What you talking about?
[57:11.12]I keep forgetting it looks like this.
[57:14.41]Once the Brotherhood Ronan and Sandy showed up, the few that were left dropped their flags before they got killed.
[57:19.21]Well, that's fucking great.
[57:21.11]Look, I know you didn't ask for it, but my advice is to just keep your head down.
[57:24.89]The cops are looking for you and a lot's changed.
[57:27.32]I say you just go buy a beer and soak up as much information as you can.
[57:30.06]Thanks, Carlos.
[57:31.93]For a second I thought he said, go grow a beard and like lay low.
[57:34.82]I'm not the most distinct looking person in the entire city.
[57:37.92]I could, guys, I could grow a beard.
[57:39.20]I could wear like eight different clothes.
[57:41.90]I could put five hats on.
[57:42.86]It doesn't matter.
[57:45.34]Alright, 500 bucks.
[57:49.12]Save the game.
[57:49.66]Yeah, so... Games, I've heard, do not, even with the Gentleman of the Row mod, that it doesn't matter.
[57:59.14]Save every time you have an opportunity.
[58:05.80]Save game.
[58:14.08]Okay.
[58:14.98]So how do I like... What am I trying to do here?
[58:22.47]How do I pick up boxes?
[58:25.75]This is not like Donkey Kong.
[58:26.81]What am I talking about?
[58:31.41]Wait, what's in here?
[58:31.91]Nothing.
[58:41.53]Third Street Saints Mission.
[58:45.99]Johnny Bravo really let himself go.
[58:50.48]Okay, I need some new clothes.
[58:52.00]Why is everybody mad at me?
[58:55.56]Oh, these are police, but wait.
[58:57.70]I need to get out of here.
[59:10.34]Wait, I can pick up the trash can.
[59:11.62]What?
[59:13.24]How do I pick this up?
[59:17.32]No, fuck.
[59:18.04]I didn't want to do that.
[59:20.44]How do I pick it up?
[59:23.77]What's wrong with me?
[59:24.59]Taunts?
[59:30.05]Is it B?
[59:32.03]It's not B. I just took a shotgun out.
[59:33.69]It's not B. How do I pick up the trash can?
[59:37.23]It's R?
[59:37.73]R?
[59:40.03]No, it's not.
[59:42.29]It's not.
[59:44.15]Don't hit that person.
[59:46.29]What are you doing?
[59:47.01]Leave me alone.
[59:47.57]I'm not even trying to hurt you.
[59:49.60]Get away from me, please.
[59:51.02]Get away from me.
[59:51.62]Get away from me.
[59:52.08]Get away from me.
[59:52.48]Get away from me.
[59:54.32]Wait, did you just bump?
[59:57.84]Leave me alone.
[59:59.88]I'm just... Hold A?
[60:04.70]Oh my god, please leave me alone.
[60:12.90]They're gonna start swarming me.
[60:15.26]Oh my god, this lady is relentless.
[60:17.88]I didn't... Okay, where do I need to go?
[60:25.36]This way.
[60:25.66]You're not still following me, right?
[60:28.82]No.
[60:29.08]Alright.
[60:29.66]Good.
[60:30.58]Pick up trash can.
[60:34.16]Somebody said hold A. Okay, it is hold A.
[60:45.93]Oh my god, that guy.
[60:47.33]Go buy a lottery ticket.
[60:58.26]What the fuck?
[61:03.64]I mean, what?
[61:04.18]Why would you... Imagine throwing a trash... Imagine just seeing somebody throw a trash can at somebody.
[61:08.47]Like, what the fuck is happening right now?
[61:13.29]Oh, fuck.
[61:13.95]Okay, I'm gonna go.
[61:16.38]I need a car.
[61:17.64]Oh shit.
[61:19.75]Oh shit.
[61:20.27]Oh shit.
[61:20.61]I should have done that.
[61:22.31]Give me that.
[61:31.94]Get on the bike and go.
[61:33.18]Go!
[61:35.32]Get on the bike.
[61:38.79]What is she holding?
[61:39.35]What is that?
[61:41.22]Was that a drill?
[61:42.48]She's got a fucking power drill.
[61:44.28]Oh, she's drilling that.
[61:45.04]Wait a minute.
[61:45.76]What?
[61:48.18]Oh, fuck.
[61:49.36]I didn't... Who are these people?
[61:52.06]Get away from me.
[62:01.37]Okay, hold on.
[62:01.85]I need to stop.
[62:03.03]I have to stop.
[62:03.59]Wait a minute.
[62:07.65]Okay, I'm fine.
[62:09.61]I'm okay.
[62:15.02]If I let myself go too hard there, I'm gonna get hurt.
[62:18.04]I need to slow down.
[62:21.61]Oh wait, I'm still holding a gun.
[62:22.57]Put that away.
[62:27.85]Don't do stupid fucking tricks, you idiot.
[62:30.05]Just get to the thing.
[62:30.85]Okay.
[62:43.28]Buy clothes.
[62:45.44]What?
[62:45.94]Clothing stores allow you to customize your character.
[62:47.60]By buying clothes, you can increase your style rank.
[62:49.38]Oh, it's because I have a gun out.
[62:52.92]Okay.
[62:53.97]Purchase some clothes.
[62:55.71]We can get hats.
[63:00.81]None of these are going to look right at all.
[63:04.45]This really is a bicycle seat.
[63:07.71]Should I get the bicycle seat?
[63:11.37]I'm going to get this.
[63:17.48]No, no.
[63:18.40]I want... Hold on.
[63:19.10]You can do different styles?
[63:22.35]Arts.
[63:29.63]It's the Joker.
[63:30.37]Make him the Joker?
[63:31.13]Are those cops after me?
[63:34.39]I hear sirens.
[63:37.72]It's a shower cap.
[63:40.82]Yeah, I don't want this.
[63:43.86]Actually, I'd rather have this.
[63:46.30]Yeah.
[63:49.17]Okay.
[63:51.55]Oh, goodness.
[63:59.44]How much is this?
[64:07.48]Okay.
[64:07.78]How about the... Keep the basic tea on for now.
[64:14.75]The tank top.
[64:20.13]You sure you don't want me to have, like, the bathing suit?
[64:23.90]The onesie bathing suit?
[64:36.97]Okay, what about... I don't want anything underneath.
[64:39.81]Because I want it to be a bathing suit.
[64:45.31]Is there none?
[64:45.70]None?
[64:48.85]I guess I could do the Jean shorts.
[64:54.10]I have to be honest.
[64:55.62]There's no way that foot's coming out of that shoe ever again.
[64:59.00]Those essentially have been surgically put on.
[65:01.28]They're not coming out.
[65:10.01]Roller skates?
[65:11.45]No way.
[65:12.87]Can I roller skate around?
[65:18.12]You're gonna love that until it falls apart when you go home.
[65:21.60]Keeping the socks.
[65:27.15]Definitely, definitely, I want these.
[65:28.31]I just want tighty-whities on.
[65:40.93]Okay, that was good.
[65:44.70]Should I have like arm pads?
[65:46.98]No, no.
[65:49.25]Outfits.
[65:52.45]No.
[65:52.83]Okay, what else?
[65:57.95]Miscellaneous one.
[65:59.55]No.
[66:00.97]A tool belt?
[66:05.13]Yes!
[66:06.07]Look at that hammer.
[66:08.67]Absolutely, I want the tool belt.
[66:09.83]I'm ready.
[66:14.70]Okay, switch to wardrobe.
[66:17.95]How do I switch to wardrobe?
[66:18.77]What's space?
[66:22.49]No, what did I just buy?
[66:23.45]Did I just buy the tool belt twice?
[66:25.81]What happened?
[66:26.61]No, what?
[66:30.64]Space is space.
[66:31.78]Okay, well, whatever.
[66:46.84]Why can I do that?
[66:55.49]Can I take the cash?
[66:56.19]Is there money in here?
[66:57.47]Oh my god, that lady.
[67:00.65]Is there money in here?
[67:01.71]How do I get the money out?
[67:02.57]Why can't I leave?
[67:03.27]Am I too big to leave the store?
[67:05.25]How do I get?
[67:10.28]How do I?
[67:12.58]I want the money in this thing.
[67:13.62]Is there money?
[67:28.01]I already got it?
[67:28.81]Oh, I got it, I got it.
[67:29.53]Okay.
[67:41.57]Let's go.
[67:43.27]Yeah, I am in roller skates, but I'm not skating.
[67:58.04]Oh, damn it.
[67:59.50]That was so close to hitting that guy in the head with trash.
[68:03.40]Save, save, save, save, save, save, save.
[68:18.12]I need a car.
[68:22.82]Wrong button.
[68:28.01]I wish I could skate around.
[68:29.19]Alright, what's reverse?
[68:38.60]Give me a break!
[68:39.60]What the fuck?!
[68:40.94]No!
[68:41.46]Get- Get- Leave me alone, please!
[68:59.94]I thought that I just got struck by lightning.
[69:01.48]I thought that was lightning that just hit right there.
[69:15.13]Leave me alone.
[69:15.55]You stole his car.
[69:19.91]Is there a handbrake?
[69:24.53]What's the handbrake?
[69:27.37]Christmas music.
[69:27.93]Alright, alright, alright.
[69:28.65]Hold on.
[69:30.31]Alt-tabbing is going to be a disaster.
[69:32.13]I've got to be careful.
[69:36.09]Hold on.
[69:36.29]Let me save it right here.
[69:37.23]Okay.
[69:43.68]Don't forget about Christmas music.
[69:44.78]I know.
[69:45.06]I'm getting it.
[69:48.22]Hope it doesn't crash.
[70:01.26]Will crash?
[70:01.78]It might.
[70:02.96]We'll find out.
[70:03.46]Alright, Chris.
[70:10.02]Should I put on Ludwig's music?
[70:16.49]How many songs did he do?
[70:22.15]Oh, shit.
[70:22.39]He's got like a shitload of songs.
[70:24.99]No music.
[70:28.87]I'm putting it on.
[70:35.95]It's gonna be just low in the background.
[70:37.13]Pretty relaxed.
[70:48.22]Okay, then it did a crash.
[70:49.20]Now I can do my own rendition too if you want.
[70:58.57]You can't even hear the music.
[70:59.91]It's drowned out by fucking rain.
[71:14.41]Hold on, this- It actually works really well.
[71:24.96]The fucking lightning!
[71:29.78]This Christmas sucks!
[71:31.52]It's scary out here!
[71:33.16]...by the trial of the century.
[71:48.12]I have to pause it for this.
[71:50.24]I have to pause it.
[71:51.08]I can't turn it off.
[71:51.80]I can't alt tab.
[71:52.54]I can't.
[72:29.56]Christmas is ruined.
[72:31.64]Oh, shit.
[72:32.96]Oh, shit.
[72:51.77]Wait, what?
[72:52.21]Who's that?
[72:52.81]Oh, I don't know who that was.
[72:55.25]Why did I just do that?
[73:02.98]No, how do I have to fight?
[73:04.42]Why are these people here?
[73:05.22]Is somebody up on the roof?
[73:07.82]Where is this person?
[73:11.18]I don't know where this person is.
[73:14.10]I missed that whole cutscene.
[73:15.00]I was laughing at the Christmas music.
[73:21.19]Well, how do I get out of here?
[73:26.55]How do I get out of here?
[73:29.73]Do I have to fight these people?
[73:32.02]They're on the mini-map.
[73:33.50]Are you on the mini-map?
[73:35.04]I don't know if... Are you on the mini-map?
[73:36.88]I think she's on the mini-map.
[73:39.10]Are you on the mini-map?
[73:42.78]Are these people on the mini-map?
[73:44.64]I gotta get out of here.
[73:57.77]Let's get out of here.
[74:03.82]Who is this?
[74:08.74]What are you doing?
[74:11.36]What, are you gonna spray with pepper spray?
[74:13.86]A spray can?
[74:17.16]I don't even... Just wait, hold on.
[74:19.67]I gotta deal with... I don't wanna shoot you, but I'm gonna...
[74:24.70]Alright, you're fucking dead, buddy.
[74:25.92]I'm sick of this shit.
[74:27.34]Get the fuck out of here.
[74:29.62]Get out of here!
[74:35.66]Get off!
[74:38.62]Get off!
[74:40.04]I'm getting lightheaded now.
[74:41.72]Okay.
[74:42.32]Let's go to the... We only have three minutes?
[74:57.52]What?!
[74:57.88]The court!
[74:58.70]I gotta get to the courthouse!
[75:03.92]Who's behind me?
[75:24.53]Give me this car, I gotta get to the courthouse in three minutes!
[75:29.41]Go!
[75:58.59]Alright.
[76:00.49]This is good.
[76:02.46]Can we take a second to understand?
[76:04.40]Like, this is, like, good music.
[76:05.82]They did a fucking fantastic job.
[76:07.96]Alright.
[76:09.52]Go.
[76:10.22]I'm at the corner.
[76:14.25]Alright.
[76:22.50]What am I doing here?
[76:23.38]Why am I here?
[76:25.37]Find the courtroom?
[76:26.47]What?
[76:26.71]I don't know where this person is.
[76:31.31]I wasn't even listening.
[76:31.99]I wasn't paying any attention.
[76:37.13]What room are they in?
[76:43.70]Which door is it?
[76:44.44]Oh, I need a break.
[76:54.78]It's the most wonderful time of the year.
[77:01.73]With the kids jingle belling and everyone telling you be of good cheer.
[77:07.51]What am I doing here?
[77:10.51]Mr. Gat, you've been convicted of over 300 murders.
[77:14.15]Do you really expect this appeal to work?
[77:15.89]I figure with the statute of limitations, it really should be close to 250.
[77:19.84]There's no statute of limitations for murder!
[77:22.40]What a fu- Oh, fuck!
[77:23.86]I just- I didn't- Hold on, I gotta pause it.
[77:25.55]Or what?
[77:26.03]You hold me in contempt of court?

[77:30.97]I need a break.
[77:31.35]My fucking head's gonna explode.
[77:33.77]I'm curious if you can keep your cavalier attitude when 2,000 volts are running through your body.
[77:38.45]Oh yeah?
[77:39.05]And I'm curious if you can keep acting like a douchebag when I shove that gavel up your ass.
[77:43.74]My client would like that stricken from the record.
[77:46.76]What's that?
[77:52.71]What the fuck just happened?

[83:35.93]Not like you were counting.
[83:37.51]Yeah, right?
[83:38.73]You know, it's weird.

[83:42.89]How do I shoot the gun?
[83:46.79]Wait till they get out.
[83:47.39]That's the strategy.

[84:03.69]That was not what I did it for.
[84:04.66]Oops.
[84:04.76]Forgive and Forget allows you to remove all notoriety for a price.

[85:11.27]Oh, my goodness!
[85:14.90]When did I become the librarian in the Cinnamon Toast Crunch commercial?

[103:39.09]Gamepad controls?
[103:43.46]I think that's a mod thing.
[103:46.18]It should be enabled.
[103:46.88]I don't know why it's not enabled.
[103:53.76]Graphics quality.
[103:54.70]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[103:55.66]No, I don't think it's here.
[103:58.36]It should be just part of the mod.
[104:04.72]Enable display.
[104:05.77]It's not in display.
[104:06.35]Okay.
[104:08.60]It's in audio.
[104:09.42]Alright.
[104:09.70]Yeah, it's in the mod configuration.

[105:18.59]Okay, what time is it?
[105:19.41]Uh... This guy is still in the car.
[105:31.67]Why are they on my ass so bad?
[105:40.80]I want to get a hamburger.
[105:44.37]Is there a drive-through?
[105:45.83]Look at the mini-map.
[105:47.91]Oh, drive-through.
[106:03.52]It's a mission marker?
[106:04.94]Oh my god.
[106:05.86]Okay.
[106:09.64]Hello.
[106:09.94]Welcome to Freckle
[106:16.20]Hold on, I'm not ready yet.
[106:17.13]I'm just looking at your menu.
[106:20.23]You guys have breakfast this late?
[106:24.09]Oh, shit.
[106:35.72]Oh, fuck.
[106:36.16]God damn it.
[106:45.00]Oh.
[106:47.84]Why are people swarming me?
[106:50.89]Leave me alone.
[106:51.51]Oh, what's this?
[106:55.93]This game is really fun.
[106:57.31]It's very fun.
[106:58.39]There's too much to do.
[106:59.17]Okay, let's do a race.
[107:05.17]Three, two, one.
[107:11.92]Well, this is not accurate.
[107:13.10]Everybody crashes into each other in the first one second, and only one person's left doing the race.
[107:22.54]Oh, yeah.
[107:25.14]Are you fucking kidding me?
[107:26.26]I didn't know you had to touch it.
[107:36.79]I'll make it up.
[107:41.48]I'll make the time up, don't worry, just watch.
[107:47.07]What's handbrake on controller?
[107:48.15]Somebody tell me.
[107:53.89]What is it?
[107:55.11]Is it Y?
[107:55.49]It's not Y. It's not B either.
[107:58.65]Is it B?
[108:00.03]It's not B. You fucking liars.
[108:02.41]What is it?
[108:04.64]R1?
[108:06.14]I told you I could make the time up.
[108:07.40]It's not R1 either!
[108:15.28]I just turned on cruise control.
[108:18.92]Okay, left trigger.
[108:19.68]Thank you.
[108:20.12]Where's the person in first place?
[108:31.13]Come on.
[108:31.33]There they are.
[108:41.35]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[108:42.47]Crash into somebody.
[108:43.09]Crash, crash, crash, crash, crash.
[108:48.49]Come on!
[108:49.23]Hit something!
[108:49.71]Hit anything!

[109:03.12]Why is boost?
[109:05.55]Oh, really?
[109:06.61]That's pretty cool.
[109:08.15]Nice.
[109:08.67]Why is boost?
[109:09.39]That's cool.
[109:11.71]That's the silver.
[109:12.19]I got the silver.
[109:12.75]Whatever.
[109:17.45]Alright, let's actually do a mission now.
[109:18.73]What's this?
[109:19.01]Is this a store?
[109:20.77]Oh, no.
[109:21.09]I want to see the store.
[109:28.60]That's pretty sick.
[109:29.10]I jumped over him.
[109:35.02]What store is it?
[109:37.58]What?
[109:45.12]Well, I got a bike.
[109:45.70]Oh, it's the doctor.
[109:47.60]Take that limo.
[109:48.50]No, I don't want it.
[109:50.52]Can I fly with this?
[109:51.42]Does it push me up?
[109:54.89]No, oh well.
[109:55.43]Alright, it's time to do a mission.
[110:00.93]I've been doing nothing for like an hour and a half.
[110:07.86]No!
[110:08.38]Yeah.
[110:09.86]Okay, here we go.
[110:11.30]Mission.

[110:26.62]I look like I was asleep What the fuck is happening what why is it on fire oh my fucking god I
[110:52.32]Let's go.
[110:52.68]How come this is not on my mini-map right now?
[111:00.56]Waypoint.
[111:00.92]There we go.
[111:09.31]Oop.
[111:11.13]Oop.
[111:16.45]Quick before it explodes.
[111:17.43]Quick before it explodes.
[111:27.84]Map can be buggy in this game.
[111:28.86]Heads up.
[111:29.24]Okay.
[111:29.86]Good to know.
[111:37.67]That guy just dove.
[111:38.87]He wasn't even paying attention either.
[111:42.63]Can I go in the restaurant during operating hours?
[111:46.71]I need to find out.
[111:47.45]I'm very curious.
[111:51.31]Can I actually go in here or is it only a drive-thru?
[111:56.96]Oh, well.
[112:01.03]It's the only drive-thru?
[112:01.93]Aww.
[112:07.34]Your voice makes my balls ache.
[112:10.42]I don't... I... That could be... I don't know what that even means.
[112:13.14]That could go in a bunch of different directions.
[112:18.00]What is that?
[112:18.44]Is that like liquor?
[112:24.19]What's this?
[112:25.89]Alcohol or something?
[112:26.81]Like drinks?
[112:34.48]What is this?
[112:40.19]It's a pet store?
[112:42.01]Liquor store?
[112:44.71]Where's the entrance?
[112:46.19]When he said, yo, where's the music?
[112:51.73]Can't do music.
[112:55.92]Wait, can I buy a car?
[112:59.32]Purchase more expensive vehicles at vehicle dealerships.
[113:08.71]What a weird way to get off the bike.
[113:11.47]Oh.
[113:12.85]Oh, come on.
[113:18.60]15,000.
[113:19.84]Oh.
[113:23.28]Compensator.
[113:28.90]Cool.
[113:29.86]Can I hit this guy with the car?
[113:39.02]70,000.
[113:39.34]I think there's extra cars in the mod.
[113:52.51]Are these extra?
[113:54.93]The mod apparently adds a bunch of cards.
[114:04.26]Very cool.
[114:05.60]That's cool.
[114:07.83]Why is Troy still going easy on me?
[114:11.46]What mod is this?
[114:11.92]This is Gentleman of the Row.
[114:13.16]Scrub.
[114:16.76]That's at a different shop.
[114:17.60]You just call me Scrub?
[114:18.40]No.
[114:21.08]Not worth it.
[114:22.72]What?
[114:41.63]Let's do it.
[114:49.03]Well, come on in.
[114:54.21]Like a melted action figure.
[114:56.41]You want a beer?
[114:56.91]Yeah, that'd be great.
[115:01.44]Juggles the great.
[115:05.38]Johnny, who's that?
[115:06.88]Yo, come to the living room and find out.
[115:10.38]Don't do that.
[115:11.08]A bottle opener is like a dollar fifty.
[115:12.52]You're gonna get hurt.
[115:13.32]You're gonna break it.
[115:13.94]It's gonna cut you.
[115:14.46]Don't do that.
[115:14.96]Don't be an idiot.
[115:16.14]You're gonna fuck up your table.
[115:16.92]I almost was.
[115:17.26]Yeah, I've been getting that a lot.
[115:18.18]What's the rush?
[115:18.80]I've been cooped up on death row and that bitch has been laid out in a coma.
[115:39.58]We definitely need to remind motherfuckers who we are.
[115:42.78]And that can't wait until after dinner?
[115:44.63]No.
[115:46.59]You two haven't changed at all.
[115:48.27]Well, you know, there's a saying about dogs and blowing shit up.
[115:52.49]So what's the plan?
[115:54.25]We get our crew together.
[115:55.81]Once we got that, we can work on how we're taking back our city.
[115:58.88]Sounds good.
[116:00.06]And where were you planning on having this little meeting?
[116:06.41]Right here.
[116:07.14]He sounds like the Geico gecko.
[116:09.26]See, what we do here is... I talk about... It's a commercial.
[116:14.00]It's not a commercial, though.
[116:15.68]I'm a real person.
[116:19.23]I'm treated like a real guy.
[116:20.79]Geico, I'm a real guy.
[116:21.81]I'm not a fucking fake lizard.
[116:35.56]Did you know?
[116:36.02]That was me.
[116:36.92]That came up with the idea.
[116:38.08]That guy could save 15% of my own conscience.
[116:40.88]I was me.
[116:41.38]A lizard.
[116:42.20]I'm not real.
[116:42.86]Even though they treat me like I'm a real person talking to a camera.
[116:45.38]Like it's like the ad people are there in the room.
[116:47.62]And the cameraman and shit.
[116:49.84]Stop making those.
[116:51.66]Stop making those.
[116:52.48]We don't like them.
[116:56.41]Make more.
[116:56.65]You're talking about them right now.
[116:58.39]Yeah.
[116:58.67]Advertising worked on you.
[116:59.39]No, it didn't.
[116:59.93]I'm completely immune to advertising.
[117:26.45]See?
[117:27.43]I'm one of those people that says no ads work on me.
[117:31.46]Which usually means all ads work on me.
[117:41.54]And I can tell you that ads work.
[117:44.04]Because the amount of times that I've seen stuffed crust pizza ads in my life.
[117:48.48]When I was preparing stuffing for Thanksgiving, I wanted a stuffed crust pizza because of the word stuff.
[117:53.88]They fucked me up for life.
[117:55.58]For life.
[118:10.20]Why are you not eating stuffed crust right now?
[118:12.80]That's a really good question, but hold on a second.
[118:16.01]I just had to... Is he okay?
[118:27.47]He's okay.
[118:28.49]He's alright.
[118:30.31]He's okay.
[118:33.03]We can swim.
[118:33.68]We're fine.
[118:36.06]We made it.
[118:45.76]We don't have a car anymore, but we'll get there.
[118:50.16]It was like a coin pusher game.
[118:51.58]They were right on the edge.
[118:52.55]I had to push them.
[119:10.13]No!
[119:10.49]Alright, I'm fine.
[119:20.42]Don't you think you wouldn't be wanting to walk over here?
[119:33.48]All of you thought it was going to happen again and I made sure that it wouldn't.
[119:40.76]I made damn sure that it was not going to happen again.
[119:44.13]But I'll tell you right now I want this person's car because it's way better.
[119:49.14]Easy.
[119:51.02]Easy.
[119:52.68]No, they got away.
[119:53.64]What happened?
[120:11.42]Okay, here we go.
[120:11.90]Let's do it.
[120:14.86]Make your way underground.
[120:15.78]Do I have enough weapons for this?
[120:26.02]I'm sorry.
[120:28.24]I had to do it.
[120:28.82]I haven't done it in a while.
[120:43.01]To go underground?
[120:49.86]Resident Evil 4 graphics.
[120:51.89]That's a great game, too.
[121:04.29]Wait.
[121:07.61]Let's flashbang the room first.
[121:10.04]That didn't work.
[121:10.50]Never mind.
[121:13.02]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[121:15.06]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[121:16.22]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[121:17.84]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[121:31.19]Where is he?
[121:31.47]Down there?
[121:31.75]Hey, what the fuck?
[121:39.73]Ooh.
[121:46.91]Watch out.
[121:47.47]Don't run in my line of fire.
[121:48.77]What are you, out of your mind?
[121:57.82]How much ammo do I have?
[122:01.08]You alright?
[122:02.90]We didn't even get hurt.
[122:04.24]Oh, shit.
[122:10.53]I'm sorry.
[122:11.05]I'm sorry.
[122:11.33]I'm sorry.
[122:11.63]I'm sorry.
[122:12.09]You alright?
[122:12.47]You okay?
[122:12.87]You okay?
[122:13.33]You okay?
[122:13.61]Get up.
[122:13.81]Get up.
[122:13.99]Get up.
[122:16.05]Tagging?
[122:18.55]Oh, shit.
[122:18.91]Nice.
[122:19.37]Let's go.
[122:27.40]This is kind of hard with a... This is kind of hard with a controller.
[122:32.85]Shake the spray can?
[122:41.66]You got this?
[122:42.18]Can you handle it?
[122:48.40]Oh my god!
[122:49.50]What just happened?
[123:00.46]Gun.
[123:01.88]Nice.
[123:07.02]Okay.
[123:15.15]What?
[123:17.15]Oh, it's a shotgun now.
[123:18.11]Wait, no.
[123:18.43]I want the other gun.
[123:21.91]Oh, fuck it.
[123:22.27]I'll use shotgun.
[123:22.79]Who cares?
[123:23.19]This is my weapon of choice anyways.
[123:24.27]I'll show you why.
[123:30.72]Just wait.
[123:31.34]I'll show you why in a minute.
[123:33.08]Who are these people?
[123:35.18]Oh.
[123:40.48]What was going on?
[123:41.24]Why did they all get out of there?
[123:42.70]What was that?
[123:45.26]What's going on?
[123:45.86]Who are these people?
[123:46.96]They're not bad?
[123:47.68]I don't know.
[123:48.76]I saw them get up on the grass and start running at me.
[123:52.50]I didn't know.
[123:53.14]I did not know.
[123:54.66]I'm sorry.
[123:55.22]You want to handle this one?
[124:01.45]You take care of this one.
[124:02.51]You get it.
[124:04.09]I'll get it.
[124:04.95]You idiot.
[124:13.44]Oh my god.
[124:14.84]Fuck off with this bullshit.
[124:24.30]Got him.
[124:28.04]One more up here.
[124:31.97]Alright, we did it.
[124:33.52]Destroy the shanties.
[124:36.56]Um... Can we get out of here?
[124:42.66]What do we have to do?
[124:56.78]Whoa!
[124:59.86]Use left control to take someone as a human shield.
[125:02.28]Prevent you from getting hit by most bullets.
[125:03.88]What?
[125:04.06]I don't know what that button is.
[125:06.50]I have no idea what that button is.
[125:09.80]Um.
[125:13.64]Oh my god.
[125:14.96]How do I do that?
[125:16.10]Dude!
[125:16.80]That's no way to act.
[125:18.52]I'm gonna have to tell you right now.
[125:19.60]That's no way to act.
[125:20.82]That's no way to act.
[125:22.98]I'm sorry it's not.
[125:32.28]Why won't this break?
[125:38.80]That's no way to act, but how do I do this?
[125:47.21]Throw someone at it.
[125:52.84]Okay, I have to figure out what that button that is.
[125:55.00]Come here.
[125:55.20]I'm going to test some stuff on you for a second.
[126:00.40]It's not... Wait, you're not actually mad, right?
[126:03.65]Right bumper?
[126:05.95]Why?
[126:06.85]What is control?
[126:08.17]Left bumper?
[126:08.65]Okay, it's left bumper.
[126:11.51]So hold on.
[126:12.19]Don't shoot this person.
[126:13.35]Don't shoot this person!
[126:14.65]Stop!
[126:17.79]Do not!
[126:21.41]Oh my goodness gracious.
[126:22.65]Okay, don't shoot that person.
[126:24.57]I'm gonna fucking be pissed if you do.
[126:30.31]Oops.
[126:30.60]You really think you can take my crew?
[126:38.19]I can't believe you can... It's not like... This is not... We're not playing... Okay.
[126:44.79]I have to hold them.
[126:50.54]Why can't I just kick these?
[126:54.70]I don't... I can't.
[126:55.30]I just want to punch them down.
[126:56.66]I don't want to throw people into them.
[127:00.30]You... Don't stop doing that or I'm actually going to hurt you.
[127:03.36]I'll hurt you, motherfucker.
[127:04.14]I will.
[127:04.52]Don't do that.
[127:15.06]Seen too much?
[127:18.04]What happened?
[127:23.48]Put the fucking gun down now.
[127:24.54]Why are we doing this?
[127:36.16]Is this like another gang?
[127:37.76]Holy shit, they have fucking weapons.
[127:47.27]Hold on.
[127:49.05]I'm stunlocked.
[127:49.57]Okay, go.

[129:07.96]Okay, alright.
[129:10.16]Fill up your respect bar to play this mission.
[129:12.04]Oh, I can't.
[129:15.12]Yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[129:20.23]This is a Nickelodeon Nicktoons MLB mod.
[129:23.25]Okay.
[129:23.49]The more extreme that you do things, the better, the more respect.
[129:28.27]Okay.
[129:31.55]Alright.
[129:32.31]So let's do an activity.
[129:34.61]This one's the closest.
[129:35.19]We're going to do this one.
[129:36.27]Save the game.
[129:36.79]Yep.
[129:39.36]I have 2% of the game done.
[129:47.31]Wait, it's not actually right here, right?
[129:48.85]Oh, this is your garage.
[129:52.19]Oh.
[129:54.29]Okay.
[129:55.11]Oh, tagging mission.
[130:03.50]Walker comes up.
[130:20.85]What's that meter on the left?
[130:23.05]It's like the boss health meter.
[130:24.57]What does that mean?
[130:25.05]Is that my health?
[130:35.20]That's enemy attention.
[130:37.76]Oh, that would make sense then as to why they're coming over here now to kill me.
[130:41.78]Help me!
[130:42.76]Help me!
[130:43.40]Help me!
[130:43.80]Help me!
[130:44.14]Help me!
[130:44.82]Help me!
[130:53.19]Thank you.
[130:53.47]What was that?
[131:04.35]I didn't even want to do that.
[131:26.26]Wait, now all of a sudden she cares?
[131:28.00]Get me the fuck out of here.
[131:29.86]Get me out of here.
[131:58.43]Don't get hurt from this.
[131:59.35]Oh my God, you idiot.
[132:01.71]Oh my God, you idiot twice.
[132:06.36]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[132:07.10]Do it, do it, do it, do it.
[132:09.90]What is this mission?
[132:11.94]Thank God you're here.
[132:13.38]Every second we're talking is one more second of airtime that Zach Johnson is stealing from me.
[132:19.07]Who?
[132:19.97]You know, that nut job lawyer who gets hard at the idea of a lawsuit.
[132:23.78]Lately he's been crusading against media he deems to be offensive.
[132:27.70]You gonna be dead when the mission starts?
[132:29.24]Not really.
[132:30.00]But the guy makes a big enough ass out of himself that whenever he pulls some stunt, people listen.
[132:35.56]And if people are watching him, they're not watching me.
[132:39.83]So what do you want me to do?
[132:41.33]Get out there and give me something worth covering.
[132:43.99]The more damage you do, the longer I can do a live broadcast.
[132:50.63]Cause carnage.
[132:52.69]Okay.
[132:54.53]Wait.
[132:55.89]I have to do a bunch of shit for you to film it?
[133:01.19]Okay.
[133:03.85]I have to give you the fucking content.
[133:11.16]Does it matter what I do?
[133:12.24]Or do I just have to break stuff?
[133:16.05]Do I have to go to a specific area?
[133:18.73]That trash can was probably at least $100.
[133:24.44]Uh... That was carnage.
[133:29.76]I mean, I just broke a bunch of stuff.
[133:31.40]Do 50,000 property damage.
[133:32.90]Alright.
[133:39.31]That was so easy.
[133:49.17]Did I do it?
[133:51.23]Get a bonus, destroy luxury cards.
[133:55.99]Wait, what about in here?
[133:56.53]Does this explode?
[134:06.48]Ooh!
[134:10.88]That was not $50,000 in damage?
[134:13.14]What are you talking about?
[134:14.44]That was an entire gas station.
[134:23.44]What happened?
[134:25.58]Oh.
[134:31.89]Alright, cool.
[134:34.85]Getting new missions now, right?
[134:43.01]I still want to figure out what this actually is.
[134:44.58]I see all these bottles.
[134:47.32]I need to investigate.
[134:48.08]What does this mean?
[134:53.49]Okay, so it's a little store.
[134:56.92]Does that get me in trouble?
[135:03.26]Oh, no.
[135:03.68]Who let the mayhem guy in here?
[135:05.14]It does get me in trouble.
[135:10.44]Oh, no.
[135:11.52]Okay, I do get in trouble.
[135:13.64]I get in trouble.
[135:21.84]I didn't even touch this guy.
[135:24.60]I'm trying to pick him up.
[135:26.88]How do I pick up people?
[135:30.14]You're a hippo that got into a store.
[135:31.97]I didn't even rob the register.
[135:39.55]It shouldn't be of an old lady.
[135:41.27]I'm just having trouble.
[135:42.67]There was a big scary man in here earlier and he was destroying stuff.
[135:46.31]He fucking bought it.
[136:03.05]Oh, I can do another mission.
[136:04.53]Put that on the map.
[136:07.77]I can go here.
[136:10.48]Or I can go down here.
[136:11.54]What's this?
[136:14.08]Stronghold mission.
[136:15.96]This one's closer.
[136:16.48]I'll do this one.
[136:17.00]There's so much to do.
[136:17.84]This is ridiculous.
[136:23.47]Do Eren.
[136:24.49]No.
[136:24.75]I have three stars.
[136:28.59]How many stars can you get max in this game?
[136:30.21]Is it six?
[136:45.00]I can't I hate I don't want to do it but it may you make me do it when you say it holy shit scared me
[137:08.35]Oops.
[137:13.43]Am I closer?
[137:20.31]+2.
[137:20.85]Dying joke.
[137:21.59]I know.
[137:21.87]Didn't you, yellow belt?
[137:24.83]I could hear you, yellow belt, from all the way over here.
[137:34.75]Door cut?
[137:37.02]Maybe.
[137:40.98]I think it's up.
[137:41.40]Do I have to go on the highway?
[137:46.22]Come on, GPS.
[137:46.64]What the hell are you doing?
[137:54.69]Yeah, we'll take a pee break in a minute.
[138:02.31]Doy, doy, doy, doy.
[138:06.51]Why does the GPS keep changing?
[138:08.27]Where is it?
[138:09.26]Stop.
[138:22.38]Why?
[138:22.58]This GPS is not even on a road.
[138:27.32]What is this GPS telling me to do?
[138:33.20]What?
[138:33.48]I have to go underground.
[138:45.62]Oh, okay.
[138:48.48]Hold on.
[138:50.46]Tag mission.
[139:00.92]Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.
[139:02.42]More Eren.
[139:03.15]No, I don't.
[139:03.67]If you want to see more Eren, just go watch Attack on Titan dub.
[139:06.99]It happens every other episode.
[139:14.39]I love it.
[139:24.13]Dub an entire episode.
[139:27.31]I don't know.
[139:28.09]That's not happening.
[139:35.26]This is literally... Oh, the game just fucking crashed.
[139:38.10]Shit.
[139:40.14]What was the last time I saved it?
[139:46.55]It was pretty recent.
[139:49.51]I'll go pee.
[139:49.99]Yeah, we'll take a pee break.
[139:51.01]This is a good time to take a break.
[139:53.86]Right after the last mission.
[139:54.68]That's alright.
[139:55.22]I'll be fine.
[139:56.66]You break.
[139:56.97]I'll be right back.
[140:26.42]Over your back.
[141:27.92]Alright, now I'm actually BRBing.
[141:28.92]I want to make sure I can load the game back in.
[141:30.15]We're back.
[145:49.02]Man, I'm telling you.
[145:51.20]Ever since I got this 3090, this room is 10 degrees hotter than it was before.
[145:56.15]It just is.
[145:58.11]I could be playing Minesweeper.
[146:01.93]It doesn't matter.
[146:02.37]Bathroom break joke?
[146:08.06]Where were you?
[146:08.76]I was taking a break.
[146:10.20]I was just taking a break.
[146:12.82]Whatever.
[146:13.08]What?
[146:13.68]What?
[146:23.00]I was looking at my tweets, and I don't know what the fuck was going on at Thanksgiving.
[146:30.18]I really don't.
[146:31.96]I can read you some of the drafts if you'd like.
[146:36.09]I didn't post any of these.
[146:38.05]I don't know why.
[146:39.73]But maybe I do know why.
[146:40.61]Okay, let's see.
[146:43.29]The first one that's in the drafts is...
[146:50.86]I accidentally threw away the wrapper to my little turkey breast I got.
[146:55.02]Is it 30, 40 minutes in the microwave?
[146:58.82]I didn't post it.
[146:59.40]I don't know.
[146:59.68]I don't understand why.
[147:02.06]An empty M&M's packet smells like someone shit in your bathroom 30 minutes ago.
[147:08.19]That's true, but I don't know why I didn't post that one either.
[147:13.62]And then, I put pumpkin pie in F tier two weeks ago.
[147:18.28]I just had it for the first time in years.
[147:20.75]I want to travel back in time and snap that motherfucker's neck.
[147:26.63]All these I've made, I wrote, but I didn't post.
[147:28.37]I don't know why.
[147:35.36]But wouldn't that kill me?
[147:43.73]That would kill, like, future me.
[147:47.09]Okay, but yeah, I had pumpkin pie and it was unbelievably good.
[147:53.88]By the way, the empty M&M's packet thing, go do it.
[147:57.42]Go do it.
[147:59.46]We'll see.
[148:02.50]Eat a little packet of M&M's.
[148:04.48]And then wait.
[148:06.12]Smell the wrapper.
[148:07.25]Inside.
[148:09.27]It's as if somebody's shitting your fucking house.
[148:11.83]And like almost an hour has gone by.
[148:13.58]But it's still kind of there.
[148:18.74]Yeah, none of these hit hard for me.
[148:21.12]I don't know why.
[148:22.28]No tweets ever do.
[148:23.26]I always write a tweet and I go, nah, I don't care.
[148:26.20]I open up Twitter once every month or two to make a tweet.
[148:31.53]I write the tweet and then before I post it, I say, I don't care about this shit and I delete it.
[148:40.64]The microwave one is a banger.
[148:42.46]Well, I also maybe didn't want people to think that I was actually doing that.
[148:45.73]It was going to, like, blow up my house.
[148:47.71]Right?
[148:48.39]I don't want people to, like, because even though I fuck around a lot, people still think that I'm, like, serious.
[149:00.85]Classic.
[149:01.71]But it's funny.
[149:02.35]Yeah, whatever.
[149:02.91]Well, I just read them to you.
[149:10.63]No, it's okay.
[149:11.09]We know you would do that.
[149:12.19]Please read.
[149:12.61]This is very important.
[149:15.57]I've sent one of your videos to a girl I've been talking to, and she stopped talking to me.
[149:18.65]Is that what you said?
[149:19.17]I can't scroll up, but... What are you doing?
[149:21.67]Okay, let's go.
[149:28.65]I'm ready.
[149:31.17]I hope this captures.
[149:32.17]Is it capturing?
[149:34.59]Okay.
[149:38.30]Customize your crib here to gain style points.
[149:41.84]Ooh.
[149:44.60]Oh, shit.
[149:45.32]Okay.
[149:45.60]2,000?
[149:49.51]Hmm.
[149:49.65]What about pimp pad?
[150:01.03]Ooh.
[150:01.79]I like this.
[150:02.95]It's 4,000.
[150:03.73]I'll save up for it.
[150:07.95]You don't even like that video.
[150:09.03]You hated that until I did it like three times.
[150:10.83]And then I somehow like brainwashed you all.
[150:13.63]I've like brainwashed all of you to think that some of these things are funny.
[150:16.36]Isn't that weird how that happened?
[150:19.70]I said Aaron one time in that voice.
[150:21.74]And everyone freaked out and said, I don't fucking do that ever again.
[150:25.32]I did it like 35,000 more times.
[150:27.34]And now everybody wants it every stream.
[150:29.02]I did the Lala dog thing.
[150:30.59]And everyone was like, stop doing that.
[150:32.45]It's cringe.
[150:32.91]It sucks.
[150:34.31]You probably watched the video.
[150:35.69]And now you want me to do it every stream.
[150:39.99]doi doi doi I did that once and people I saw like the stop stop nay nay no no no emotes alright let's go I'm just stirring up my ice copy don't drop that this is a repeat episode they're all repeats
[151:06.95]Don't you understand?
[151:07.93]These are all repeats.
[151:08.93]I can do a home theater.
[151:11.18]I don't have any money to even care about this right now.
[151:18.92]Don't leave.
[151:19.82]Okay.
[151:21.94]Mission said play zombie uprising.
[151:23.90]There's too much going on.
[151:27.03]Wait.
[151:32.49]I want to play zombie uprising.
[151:36.71]No, I don't like this.
[151:39.37]Okay, let me explain.
[151:45.09]Super Nintendo, Nintendo is burned in my brain.
[151:49.44]The B button on Nintendo, the back button, is where the A button is.
[151:56.29]On the Xbox.
[151:58.03]It's A on Xbox is like, yes, do this thing.
[152:03.63]But that's B on Nintendo.
[152:06.79]And it's ever since I was 15, 12, 11, doesn't matter, 10.
[152:10.93]This is a that's not they got to get on something here.
[152:16.36]They got to be on the same page.
[152:19.62]Because right now, it's crossed up, confirm, and back.
[152:23.18]Because they're flipped on the different consoles.
[152:25.50]Who cares?
[152:27.00]I don't want to see the person's name ever again.
[152:28.98]If I see it again, I'm going to throw up thinking about that person.
[152:36.03]Okay, no.
[152:36.67]Let's go.
[152:38.99]No!
[152:39.47]I want to... Stop the zombie assault.
[152:49.06]Is this part of the mod?
[152:49.98]I think this is the mod.
[152:53.05]Um, what's one?
[153:05.94]Which, what is one?
[153:08.60]What button on the controller is one?
[153:18.77]Is there a weapon?
[153:23.03]How do I get out?
[153:24.05]How do I leave the game?
[153:26.25]Just kill me.
[153:26.83]I don't care.
[153:27.20]This is fun, but whatever.
[153:38.50]Also, having to hit back and then confirm the back instead of pressing back twice.
[153:42.17]You know what I mean?
[153:42.63]You get it.
[153:43.15]You guys get it.
[153:43.71]I know you do.
[153:45.81]This is your stash.
[153:46.71]Ooh.
[153:50.11]Should I put money in the stash?
[153:58.38]Can people steal from me or rob me or something?
[154:02.22]Alright, I need to do this mayhem mission again because that's where we left off.
[154:12.50]This one's 100,000.
[154:12.82]I can definitely do it.
[154:19.08]That's passive income.
[154:20.24]Oh, that's cool.
[154:32.80]Oh, shit.
[154:33.18]I forgot about this.
[154:34.16]Hey.
[154:53.77]I'm gonna try to puke in his drink.
[154:58.45]Not quite.
[155:04.52]Oh, come on.
[155:05.00]It's right there.
[155:05.96]Let me just do this, please.
[155:06.88]Okay, here we go.
[155:12.32]No, wait.
[155:13.24]This is for the video.
[155:25.60]Oh my god!
[155:33.76]Am I asleep?
[155:35.80]I don't know.
[155:36.28]You might be.
[155:51.94]Although, how do you type that if you're asleep?
[155:54.78]You make no sense.
[155:55.38]Ban that person.
[156:12.54]No music.
[156:13.38]Alright, well we need to have other music then.
[156:15.04]Because I can't play the one that's on here.
[156:26.02]I'm not playing Kevin MacLeod.
[156:27.23]No thanks.
[156:28.49]He's really, really... He's really talented.
[156:31.77]Really great.
[156:32.37]Did awesome shit for the entire YouTube community when all the people were like, what are we going to do for music?
[156:38.25]It's great.
[156:38.69]It's awesome.
[156:39.87]But I don't want to listen to it.
[156:42.43]Like, what a hero.
[156:43.37]What an absolute fucking... Just gave everybody music to use.
[156:50.56]Wait, hold on.
[156:59.50]What's blocking me?
[157:03.46]Why is this bench that much stronger than the other benches?
[157:08.98]This is the strat right here.
[157:18.83]They just respawn.
[157:19.49]Do they?
[157:23.57]No, they don't.
[157:25.59]My whole face is itchy.
[157:26.37]Hold on.
[157:27.45]What the fuck is happening?
[157:45.40]Hey, good.
[157:47.37]I got two minutes to do this.
[157:48.53]I got it.
[157:51.53]This is the slowest fucking car I could possibly use to do this.
[157:56.21]Come on, break it!
[158:09.86]Oh my fucking god, whatever.
[158:38.62]I just have to get a car.
[158:39.72]Why did I even get out of that car?
[158:43.86]Use grenades?
[158:44.48]I have grenades?
[158:45.16]Oh my god, I have grenades, you're right!
[158:46.92]Oh fuck, I'm de-
[159:05.09]That's your fault.
[159:05.83]I blame you for that shit.
[159:07.75]I blame you for that.
[159:08.57]I don't know.
[159:08.85]I freaked out.
[159:10.37]I'm doing it again.
[159:10.91]I blame you for that.
[159:12.11]I really do.
[159:28.40]This is so much... This is easy with just grenades.
[159:34.45]This is like too easy doing this.
[159:35.71]Just breaking stuff.
[159:36.51]How am I so fat?
[159:39.53]I have a mod.
[159:40.90]Don't run into the grenade, you idiot.
[159:50.31]This is a cheap strategy.
[159:53.50]Yeah, this is the... I just put in the cheat codes in GTA and just went to the rocket launcher and then I got bored.
[160:00.10]You know what I mean?
[160:01.96]I just... I got bored.
[160:03.76]Like, oh, fuck.
[160:05.18]I did the cheat codes and I took out the rocket launcher.
[160:07.44]The game's no longer fun anymore.
[160:14.58]Use the true meta.
[160:15.53]Drive over fences.
[160:16.69]I'll try that.
[160:26.16]I don't want to throw this.
[160:34.57]Alright, I got two minutes to get 10,000.
[160:37.93]Don't ever get on a motorcycle ever again, Jeremy.
[160:39.76]Like, seriously, what are you doing?
[160:41.42]Alright, let's try a fence trap.
[160:54.28]I mean, the fence strat is perfect.
[161:00.00]That's actually a great strategy.
[161:01.40]Alright, I got it.
[161:08.05]Who is she shooting at?
[161:09.07]250, that's it?
[161:31.61]Okay, save the game.
[161:32.65]Let's try this again.
[161:33.55]Hopefully it doesn't crash again.
[161:43.99]I will be sad if this crashes again.
[161:45.48]Well, it's literally right here.
[161:55.60]I don't think I've blinked in two hours.
[161:57.38]Does that ever happen to you guys?
[162:01.70]Where you finally, like, end up blinking a couple times and, like, your eyes are, like, hurt and they're watery.
[162:14.43]Shake the can.
[162:19.55]Hurry up!
[162:25.83]Hurry up!
[162:40.19]Okay, game is saved.
[162:43.05]Don't crash.
[162:43.53]Please don't crash.
[162:44.09]Don't crash.
[162:47.21]Don't.
[162:48.11]Yes, we're good.
[162:53.71]You know, this ain't exactly what I had in mind for my day.
[162:56.69]We gotta clean this place out.
[162:59.18]Yo, I'm not a fucking janitor.
[163:00.74]No shit, you're a goddamn diva.
[163:02.74]Come on, this is the kind of shit people who just got canonized should have to do.
[163:05.87]Good idea.
[163:06.83]We'll just ask some of the crew for help.
[163:08.73]Hey buddy, want to help?
[163:10.39]No?
[163:11.54]Looks like we're doing this ourselves.
[163:13.48]These guys are bad guys.
[163:14.70]These people are awful.
[163:19.54]You said it yourself.
[163:20.85]Most of the old crew are either dead or busted by Troy.
[163:23.29]We're going to have to start fresh.
[163:25.34]That's the point.
[163:25.86]Yeah, no shit.
[163:26.48]I'm looking for...
[163:51.62]People that are strong, smart, can work on the fly.
[163:57.52]Who know, you know, right from wrong.
[164:05.76]Integrity.
[164:14.04]The ability to cook large meals to feed everybody?
[164:17.70]Because how are we going to do that?
[164:20.37]I don't know how to cook.
[164:21.95]We're going to have like 50 people in this... This is what happens when you just talk and you don't play video games.
[164:30.79]Okay.
[164:32.07]But yeah, seriously.
[164:32.83]What are we going to have?
[164:34.40]Like 50 people in the crew?
[164:37.14]In the same place?
[164:38.70]We have to have catering.
[164:40.38]One of the people has to be a caterer in the group.
[164:44.33]That's important.
[164:47.09]I got like a tax attorney, right?
[164:49.27]These are all things you need.
[164:50.09]Pharmacy?
[164:58.44]A pharmacist?
[164:58.98]Yeah.
[165:21.02]I would join the gang if it had a caterer.
[165:39.01]You need to have... If I was going to have a gang, I'd want to have a couple of teachers.
[165:46.19]Two or three doctors.
[166:00.83]I'm not even describing a gang at this point.
[166:02.56]I'm describing like a, like a, like your neighbor, like your neighbors, like a community.
[166:09.08]This is not even, this is just like, oh yeah, this is like a, like a community of people.
[166:12.78]We have like a few, we have doctors, we have nurses, we have workers, we have like, this is just like a houses.
[166:19.63]What am I talking about?
[166:25.31]I'm not even describing a gang.
[166:26.43]I'm describing like, I'm describing like a YMCA.
[166:31.12]You know what I mean?
[166:31.64]Like, oh yeah, we've got like a gym.
[166:33.12]We've got like people that come here.
[166:33.96]We've got doctors.
[166:34.56]We've got nurses.
[166:35.16]We've got a pool.
[166:50.50]Play the game.
[166:51.22]Fuck.
[166:51.70]I'm sorry.
[166:52.50]I know.
[166:52.90]I know.
[166:53.50]You know it.
[166:55.88]Oh, is he okay?
[166:57.42]Is he okay?
[166:59.08]Please get his money.
[167:02.13]Where are you going?
[167:02.75]I don't know.
[167:03.09]I'm not paying attention.
[167:04.01]This is what happens.
[167:04.77]I just start talking and I just drive in circles.
[167:07.05]Please bear with me.
[167:10.85]I have to go to the one over here.
[167:26.28]Let's take your time.
[167:28.30]Alright.
[167:30.26]I don't know what the mission is.
[167:32.81]Is the mission to kill this person?
[167:34.47]Is the mission to recruit this person?
[167:38.44]You a caterer?
[167:40.18]Hey, I'm Shandi.
[167:41.94]What do you say you show me what you can do in that thing?
[167:46.32]You've experienced any Italian, Mediterranean food?
[167:49.50]Because that's what I want to have.
[167:51.58]Let me tell you about a beautiful thing.
[168:00.21]You're not a chef.
[168:00.67]Do you know any chefs?
[168:02.24]Oops.
[168:10.06]You want stuff to crust.
[168:12.76]I have to go up the jump?
[168:14.84]What jump?
[168:15.50]Are you impressed?
[168:24.21]Are you impressed?
[168:25.47]That was pretty crazy, wasn't it?
[168:29.26]Well, what's with this gigantic blob here?
[168:31.78]How do I... I have to go... Okay, I get it.
[168:36.86]I'm just driving to the indicator.
[168:38.30]Follow me.
[168:38.76]We'll do it on a motorcycle, and then I guarantee you're gonna die.
[168:46.03]Just to make sure we're all aware of this.
[168:58.85]It's almost like I would put my arms around you to hold on, but I can't.
[169:08.99]Where the fuck is this?
[169:12.14]I... I don't understand what I have to do here.
[169:15.72]I have to jump that?
[169:16.68]How?
[169:18.44]Is there a... Right there?
[169:23.38]Okay.
[169:23.48]Okay.
[169:32.59]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[169:36.79]We're good.
[169:46.40]Get the fuck out of the way.
[169:56.71]Are we good?
[170:00.93]Do you care?
[170:01.56]Are we friends?
[170:04.18]We're still alive.
[170:04.94]That's good.
[170:05.38]So there's three more jumps to hit.
[170:06.86]Follow me.
[170:11.34]What?
[170:11.86]Oh.
[170:17.00]Wait, I don't know how much more of this I can... Is she injured?
[170:22.85]Well, I think that went well.
[170:25.16]Okay, where's this next one?
[170:26.62]Just get it on the map.
[170:29.89]There we, finally, okay.
[170:37.79]What just happened?
[170:41.62]I don't know, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[170:43.48]It's right there.
[170:43.94]Is it this mound?
[170:52.52]Did that count?
[170:54.60]That didn't count.
[170:55.18]Good times, good times.
[170:59.78]I'm sorry.
[171:22.55]I was trying to kill her.
[171:23.69]I was just trying to dump her.
[171:24.77]And now I have to do this again.
[171:26.33]I'm so fucking sorry.
[171:27.59]I'm actually sorry.
[171:31.25]I did not think it was going to kill me.
[171:33.33]I thought it was going to kill her.
[171:34.17]Oh, fuck.
[171:36.77]Whatever.
[171:37.21]I'm sorry.
[171:37.81]It wasn't even worth it.
[171:43.19]I thought the car was going to blow up or something.
[171:45.24]I don't know.
[171:49.56]I'll get it really quick right now.
[171:51.04]I promise.
[171:51.76]Don't leave.
[171:52.16]Stay.
[171:56.48]If I don't finish this mission in the next hour, like this one right here, to get the three jumps, like this just with her, to jump over the three jumps, just this part of this mission here, an hour, I will give 500 trillion community subs.
[172:22.97]Just this part here.
[172:23.63]We'll just go to the three jumps.
[172:24.77]That's it.
[172:25.93]This section of this mission.
[172:27.47]I have an hour.
[172:37.83]God, I hope my power doesn't go up.
[172:42.27]Why am I freaking out?
[172:43.15]I have an hour to do a mission that takes 10 seconds.
[172:49.64]Oh, by the way, by the way, even if my power goes out, if I do it, it doesn't matter.
[172:53.56]Even if, like, the stream turns off, it doesn't fucking matter.
[172:55.38]I can do it here.
[172:57.54]Just this part right here.
[172:58.84]This one.
[172:59.28]That's it.
[173:02.00]Just do the jumps.
[173:04.67]I didn't say it had to be on stream, by the way.
[173:07.83]I just had to say I had to do it in an hour.
[173:09.93]By the way, I could literally... I'm just gonna... If my power goes out or something, I'm literally gonna go download this on the Switch and play it in my bathroom and just do it.
[173:16.71]So, it counts.
[173:18.82]Get on.
[173:21.52]Quick.
[173:21.72]I'm not fucking around.
[173:22.94]I can't right now, even if it's impossible to lose.
[173:51.31]That counts.
[174:02.35]Hit it.
[174:08.23]Yep.
[174:08.77]Good.
[174:09.21]Cool.
[174:11.59]There's no reason for me to freak out about this.
[174:12.85]I have plenty of time.
[174:18.67]And I know somebody's probably gonna say, no, I did not say an hour in dog years.
[174:22.39]An hour in human years.
[174:30.45]There's two.
[174:53.38]Oh my fucking god.
[174:56.60]Alright, I'm done.
[175:07.23]I got it.
[175:07.49]Mission complete.
[175:10.26]I did it.
[175:11.12]It's been completed.
[175:32.49]It's done.
[175:33.11]She's good.
[175:34.13]We did it.
[175:34.65]It's over.
[175:35.31]I'm done.
[175:38.79]That section wasn't complete.
[175:40.23]Even if I died, it doesn't matter.
[175:43.89]That section was already complete.
[175:45.28]Look, I told you just that section.
[175:46.68]It was very clear.
[175:47.34]I would like a new weapon.
[176:05.89]Special?
[176:06.43]Throne?
[176:06.97]Flashbangs?
[176:13.99]That's so expensive.
[176:15.09]Why did I just buy that?
[176:15.91]That's stupid.
[176:21.15]I think I should... 2,000?
[176:21.83]Too much.
[176:22.13]This is too expensive.
[176:22.77]300 bucks?
[176:23.60]Dude!
[176:23.88]Double or nothing.
[176:41.31]Devil or nothing?
[176:53.21]No.
[176:53.51]No devil or nothing.
[176:54.15]It's over.
[176:55.81]Oh, that car sucks.
[176:56.45]Never mind.
[177:09.78]No.
[177:10.04]What am I doing?
[177:10.50]Let's go.
[177:12.30]We'll go right here.
[177:12.90]I'm doubling nothing that's stupid.
[177:19.22]There's so many old people here.
[177:21.16]Everybody's old.
[177:21.87]Alright, what do you want me to do?
[177:33.17]You got it.
[177:34.13]Get in the car.
[177:35.13]I made this very easy.
[177:54.49]Hey!
[177:55.87]What the fuck are you doing?
[177:57.91]What would you do that for?
[177:59.21]Why would you do that?
[177:59.97]I don't want you on the team.
[178:01.83]I don't want you part of the guild or whatever this is.
[178:03.97]No.
[178:04.61]That was stupid.
[178:05.61]What you did was dumb.
[178:07.31]And now, we're in trouble.
[178:13.68]No, I'm kicking you from the guild.
[178:21.68]Help me!
[178:28.07]He took the cop hostage.
[178:33.94]What?
[178:34.42]Who is this?
[178:35.74]No, no, no, no, no.
[178:36.54]Where's the crowbar?
[178:37.22]How'd you get a crowbar?
[178:38.33]I want that.
[178:38.75]Where are you going?
[178:58.27]Wait, it's over here.
[179:00.24]I'm gonna sneak up on him.
[179:07.74]Where are they?
[179:12.30]Where are they?
[179:46.29]What do you think about that one, huh?
[179:51.00]Don't fall off.
[179:51.54]Although it would be kind of funny if you did.
[179:53.06]Is that going to kill him?
[180:20.08]He's blazed?
[180:21.14]What?
[180:26.01]Wait, hold on.
[180:26.49]Does this reset the mission if he falls?
[180:31.49]Does it?
[180:31.75]I don't think it will.
[180:38.70]Oh my god, he's fine.
[180:41.04]And he can't even fall off this.
[180:43.26]Oh, whatever.
[180:43.66]I'm gone.
[180:43.96]Wait, why are you guys saying I'm zonked?
[180:47.55]What are you talking about?
[180:50.75]How am I zonked?
[180:51.57]I told you I was drinking coffee.
[180:53.93]There's one more person this way.
[181:15.10]What kind of coffee?
[181:15.88]An iced coffee.
[181:19.09]Let's go!
[181:19.55]An iced coffee.
[181:31.82]I made it myself.
[181:33.36]It's like 7pm where I am.
[181:34.76]It's 5.20.
[181:34.88]You don't drink coffee after 6pm.
[181:36.70]That's it.
[181:36.94]I got enough to go till 6.
[181:37.82]Brew your own coffee?
[181:38.40]Well, I mean, yeah.
[181:39.10]Would you guys like to know the best beans of coffee to use?
[181:42.04]For any occasion?
[182:02.51]You want me to tell you?
[182:04.39]I will.
[182:06.95]It's nothing fancy.
[182:08.55]It's nothing like, oh, wow, you got those beans from some random plant.
[182:12.25]You imported them from a different country.
[182:14.39]No.
[182:15.69]The Illy coffee beans are the best.
[182:17.06]They just are.
[182:18.46]Without a doubt, S-plus tier.
[182:20.22]They do everything.
[182:22.04]Hot coffee, fantastic.
[182:24.32]They do iced coffee, fantastic.
[182:27.16]Illy.
[182:28.20]It's in a little tin, a little tin can.
[182:33.17]That's the best coffee beans you can possibly buy.
[182:35.33]If you're not drinking Illy, here's what's going to happen.
[182:37.79]You're going to drink Illy for a little while and be like, oh, this is perfect.
[182:40.23]What a perfect cup of fucking coffee.
[182:41.39]And then you're going to drink something else and go, oh, this is good.
[182:44.26]This is okay.
[182:44.90]You're going to pretend to like it.
[182:46.96]You're going to get an expensive coffee and pretend to enjoy it because you want to seem like you know what you're talking about.
[182:54.08]Then you're going to eventually go back to Illy and say, yeah, why did I ever leave?
[182:58.37]There's no reason to.
[183:02.02]Alright.
[183:02.70]Back at the... Oh, we have to... I have to tow this.
[183:10.07]It's just a really good, nice, smooth cup of coffee.
[183:13.61]Illy.
[183:14.01]I-L-L-Y.
[183:16.47]I think.
[183:18.75]Coffee Snob Andy.
[183:19.55]You can get this at any grocery store.
[183:23.20]How do I pick this up?
[183:23.84]I don't want to hurt this person.
[183:31.13]Oh my god, I'm running over stuff.
[183:34.19]Left control and what is it?
[183:38.42]I don't have no idea what those buttons are.
[183:42.12]There it is.
[183:42.44]Okay, hold until the vehicle's there.
[183:45.36]Okay.
[183:46.68]Okay.
[183:46.80]Bolt triggers.
[184:02.61]Yeah, no, I'm not sponsored to say that.
[184:04.89]No.
[184:06.26]Illy Coffee Beans does not... They don't sponsor people.
[184:17.63]I'm just telling you what I truly believe.
[184:20.47]That's it.
[184:30.42]How do you grind the beans?
[184:32.26]Grind her.
[184:38.64]Freshest cup of coffee you can get is when you grind beans.
[184:40.54]Grind your beans, put it right in after grinding.
[184:45.59]That was on purpose, but it wasn't somehow.
[184:49.89]I didn't... Whatever.
[185:00.36]I'm using the car as a... What the fuck are you doing?
[185:02.38]I didn't press that.
[185:04.18]I didn't press that.
[185:07.44]I promise I didn't press that button.
[185:08.72]What kind of roast is it?
[185:14.88]I think it's just a... Oh, the goddamn game crashed.
[185:18.09]God damn it.
[185:20.77]Are you kidding me?
[185:24.79]No.
[185:26.09]Oh, no.
[185:28.93]Wait.
[185:31.41]The timer?
[185:32.07]Wait, hold on.
[185:34.15]How long has it been?
[185:39.51]No, that counts because I did it and it was completed on the stream.
[185:49.50]Uh... Oh, fuck.
[185:56.30]What?
[185:56.56]Are you kidding me?
[185:59.98]That's such horseshit.
[186:03.67]Alright, I have to start to save after every single thing I do now.
[186:07.11]Now I'm actually concerned about this.
[186:15.36]Yes, it does count.
[186:19.92]You have 45 minutes left.
[186:31.08]Stop fucking around and go!
[186:43.05]Hurry.
[186:51.36]Oh, please.
[186:55.14]Cap the game's FPS to 10.
[186:59.32]I don't think I want to do that.
[187:00.13]Turn cheats on?
[187:06.41]No, I've never experienced this game before.
[187:08.15]I'm not going right to the cheats.
[187:12.82]I'm enjoying Saints Row 2, the video game, as it was intended by the video game's development.
[187:24.50]I think it's running pretty good.
[187:25.24]I mean, it's a little chunky sometimes, but I think it's fine.
[187:30.17]I swear, what roast, please?
[187:32.01]Um... I think it was just the standard roast.
[187:34.99]Just the regular roast.
[187:37.23]It's the red can.
[187:39.74]It only has like three or four different cans.
[187:41.17]It's the one that's the red can.
[187:43.19]That has the red letters.
[187:46.89]No, it's not roast beef.
[187:50.79]It's just standard roast.
[187:52.19]I don't know what that- I don't know.
[187:59.65]How do you not know the can?
[188:02.35]It's your favorite coffee.
[188:03.71]I don't know.
[188:05.17]Whatever it is.
[188:05.63]It's like breakfast roast.
[188:06.73]Regular roast.
[188:08.07]Yum roast.
[188:08.97]Eat roast.
[188:10.33]Pork roast.
[188:11.61]It doesn't matter.
[188:12.49]The coffee's good.
[188:13.07]It's the red can.
[188:13.79]Just buy the red can.
[188:24.32]You know what they do?
[188:24.92]They have an espresso blend too.
[188:26.34]And that's also good.
[188:27.58]I've had that one before.
[188:41.97]Holy shit.
[188:42.57]Illy is owned by Folgers.
[188:44.26]Okay.
[188:49.92]Wait a minute.
[188:50.44]Before... Oh, no.
[188:51.46]It's owned by Folgers.
[188:52.36]It's a Folgers coffee.
[188:54.18]Oh, no.
[188:55.18]You mean the thing that you can go get a fucking tub of it?
[189:00.47]It's literally, like, the cheapest.
[189:02.11]Like, you can get a whole tub of Folgers for probably less than ten bucks.
[189:05.01]It'll last you, like, three months.
[189:08.21]Sometimes coffee is just coffee, and that's all you need.
[189:10.23]You don't have, like, look, I, okay, oh, I'd like a cappuccino.
[189:13.59]I'll take a macchiato, please.
[189:14.81]Yeah, but just a regular, just a cup of coffee in your coffee maker.
[189:17.34]Who cares?
[189:17.72]It's not, look, you can get some nice stuff if you want, but on a day-to-day basis, stop shooting at people.
[189:25.77]Why?
[189:33.66]I actually like Folgers.
[189:34.70]I don't think Folgers is bad.
[189:36.74]It's just regular, just regular coffee.
[189:39.44]Just diner coffee.
[189:40.94]That's not a problem.
[189:46.60]Look, some coffees are kind of gross.
[189:47.98]Even like the really nice expensive ones.
[189:53.05]Get out of the car quick.
[189:54.33]Please get out of the car.
[189:55.07]Get out of the car and get away before it explodes.
[189:57.67]Thank you.
[190:09.22]Support your local coffee roasters.
[190:10.52]There's actually a few that are really good out here.
[190:12.48]I've had.
[190:14.80]But it's just in your cupboard.
[190:16.14]Just a coffee.
[190:16.72]It's just... You can just... It's always there.
[190:18.48]It's always available.
[190:20.10]By the way, I did it.
[190:24.66]See?
[190:25.22]Done.
[190:27.07]No, I didn't.
[190:27.41]I have three more to do.
[190:28.31]Shit.
[190:28.59]Shit.
[190:38.79]Not sponsored by the way.
[190:39.83]I'm not.
[190:40.25]Why would I be sponsored by a coffee company?
[190:45.55]What?
[190:45.67]I'm just not going to announce that I have a major new sponsorship?
[190:48.81]I'm just going to say, you need to buy Italy.
[190:57.92]I have to disclose that.
[191:04.56]Or the fucking FAA regulations or whatever.
[191:09.78]Good times, good times.
[191:12.06]Whenever you're getting everyone together, let me know.
[191:13.96]I'd love to roll with you guys.
[191:15.40]Okay, save it.
[191:19.66]You're safe.
[191:20.18]We're good.
[191:28.52]Now, please get out of the way so I don't hurt you.
[191:37.04]We're good.
[191:39.26]I love Illy.
[191:41.46]Yeah.
[191:41.68]It's really good.
[191:43.69]I've had a lot of coffee in my life.
[191:46.69]And it's probably the best one I've had.
[191:48.53]That's just a regular good cup of coffee.
[191:50.27]There's nothing else I need to say to you.
[191:52.84]I don't need to prove that it's good coffee.
[191:55.84]Just get it.
[192:06.41]I have to prove it.
[192:09.86]Well, what would you guys consider as good coffee to have as beans or ground?
[192:20.09]What do you buy?
[192:22.41]If it's not illy, what is it?
[192:24.49]Folgers, what is it?
[192:26.55]Folgers, yeah.
[192:27.19]What's wrong with that?
[192:29.51]I'm seeing a lot of Folgers and a lot of you are Folgers haters for some reason.
[192:33.70]Costco brand, that's good too.
[192:42.63]Trader Joe's.
[192:43.43]That's good too.
[192:53.94]Good.
[192:57.38]Starbucks?
[192:59.26]No.
[192:59.62]If I'm going to buy coffee, it's not going to be Starbucks beans.
[193:02.66]It just isn't.
[193:06.86]Buying Starbucks beans is not... Nah.
[193:10.88]You can just go to Starbucks and get it.
[193:12.30]There's Starbucks in every fucking one mile.
[193:14.40]It's not like special.
[193:16.06]You can't- There's no like Folgers you can get.
[193:17.66]Not like, oh I'm gonna go to the Folgers store and get a Folgers from the Folgers cafe.
[193:22.19]No.
[193:32.84]I actually don't really even like Starbucks coffee that much.
[193:35.66]It's okay.
[193:47.03]Nice.
[193:47.23]These guys are trying to dodge him.
[193:52.93]Thank you.
[194:16.93]Why buy Starbucks beans so you can just go and get it from the store for 10 times more?
[194:24.05]Yeah, okay, I understand.
[194:25.63]I know, I understand what you mean.
[194:27.57]But there is something to be said about having... Being somewhere, out somewhere.
[194:31.78]It's like, you know what?
[194:34.38]Yeah, I'll take a coffee.
[194:35.90]I'll take a nice iced coffee.
[194:38.92]It's nice.
[194:39.32]Okay.
[194:47.92]Sometimes you just want to be holding around a coffee while you're walking around, just hanging out.
[194:52.56]Iced coffee is better from a cafe.
[194:54.06]It usually is.
[194:57.98]It's really difficult to make an iced coffee at home that's actually as good as a cafe.
[195:03.36]And I haven't figured out why.
[195:04.74]I don't get it.
[195:08.32]I've tried everything.
[195:09.24]The iced coffee I make is really good.
[195:10.92]But it's not the same.
[195:21.08]Shit loads of sugar.
[195:22.08]No, I don't get... I don't put sugar in my coffee.
[195:24.64]Not usually.
[195:26.86]Maybe like one.
[195:28.38]I don't put that much sugar in a coffee.
[195:31.78]I usually drink hot coffee black and iced coffee with almond milk or oat milk.
[195:36.22]And maybe like one pump of some syrup or something.
[195:45.48]But I can't replicate it at home.
[195:48.11]That person went through the windshield.
[195:49.51]Holy shit.
[195:59.87]My brother's been looking for a good... I missed that.
[196:01.11]What did they say?
[196:01.49]My brother's looking for a good recipe?
[196:05.15]I missed that.
[196:05.53]Somebody said, my brother's looking for a good recipe.
[196:08.81]For something.
[196:09.28]I didn't see what it was.
[196:17.46]Oh my god damn it.
[196:18.76]Just fucking go.
[196:19.50]I can't.
[196:22.74]That guy walked into the car.
[196:24.08]That was not even my fault.
[196:30.13]Where the fuck is the car?
[196:40.00]Hey, Ramon.
[196:40.72]What's up?
[196:41.72]Listen, I don't got a lot of time.
[196:43.47]I was just calling to let you know that I stole your car.
[196:47.51]Yeah.
[196:48.01]Are you there?
[196:49.41]Great.
[196:50.13]Here's the deal.
[196:50.65]You don't want your car cubed.
[196:52.05]I really suggest you pay me what you owe me.
[196:53.81]Talk to you later, Ramon.
[196:55.04]Did you have a car on the back like a bicycle?
[196:58.25]Enough about coffee.
[196:59.77]Are we talking about this too long?
[197:04.17]I'm really worried if you drive like this in real life.
[197:10.52]I don't drive like this.
[197:12.08]This is a video game.
[197:13.64]And there are... You don't drive a car with an analog stick and in a cartoon video game universe.
[197:35.15]Tell us about your civic.
[197:40.59]Don't distract me right now.
[197:45.62]Do an IRL driving stream.
[197:47.32]No, why would I do that?
[197:50.64]I don't want to do that.
[197:51.54]Why would I do that?
[197:59.29]This is getting ridiculous.
[198:03.84]Alright, go on.
[198:04.52]Let's go home.
[198:05.74]I can't wait to meet the rest of the gang.
[198:10.02]They... Okay, we're good.
[198:14.36]What the fuck?
[198:15.20]That scared the shit out of me.
[198:16.61]I was looking over a chat.
[198:23.01]What the hell is going on?
[198:27.07]I had to do some canonizing.
[198:28.33]Hold up.
[198:30.37]Yeah, the character is a mod that makes the slider is much higher.
[198:35.21]Gentlemen of the row.
[198:35.98]It's been great so far.
[198:37.76]Oh yeah.
[198:37.96]We listen.
[198:56.74]Giving a speech?
[198:57.48]Alright, everybody listen up.
[198:58.84]We got some serious shit to discuss.
[199:01.18]The Saints used their own Stillwater.
[199:03.36]And it seems like the only motherfuckers that remember that is me and Gat.
[199:06.92]I think it's time we give those other crews a wake-up call.
[199:13.38]Now I ain't gonna lie, a lot of shit's changed since I've been out of the game.
[199:16.67]So I'm gonna need some help.
[199:18.13]Pierce, you're on the Ronin.
[199:19.67]I wanna know who's calling the shots and what businesses they're running.
[199:22.77]Done.
[199:23.95]Shandy, you got the sons of Sandy.
[199:28.19]Did you ever have kids?
[199:29.05]No, I've shit my pants in the last year.
[199:32.27]I can't handle it.
[199:32.77]I wouldn't be able to do it.
[199:33.53]That means you must be good at changing diapers.
[199:57.69]Oh, God.
[199:58.17]Okay, you now recruit a single saint follower.
[200:02.47]Press up to recruit nearby saints.
[200:04.43]Okay.
[200:13.24]Cool.
[200:13.38]So I can have a one-person crew.
[200:22.39]Alright.
[200:23.01]So there are more symbols popping up here.
[200:24.67]What do these mean?
[200:27.07]Start a Ronin mission?
[200:28.97]Start the Sons of... Hello?
[200:30.13]I got it.
[200:32.37]Okay, there's a lot going on here.
[200:34.13]What's that, a drink?
[201:00.05]Oh, I wanted more of that.
[201:05.39]There are diverging quest lines.
[201:07.19]It's an RPG.
[201:08.15]Really?
[201:13.10]That's actually pretty cool.
[201:16.52]I want to do this one.
[201:18.14]No, I want to do one of the just random missions.
[201:20.22]This game's really fun.
[201:21.16]You know what sucks?
[201:24.98]We talked about, because this is THQ, right?
[201:37.42]Yeah.
[201:38.90]This is THQ, right?
[201:40.68]Here comes the THQ rant.
[201:46.17]Well, you know what I'm going to say.
[201:47.81]Who saw that?
[201:48.51]Alright.
[201:49.29]Can you get arrested?
[202:12.24]What's going on?
[202:12.78]I'm looking over there.
[202:13.57]I'm not even paying attention to these two.
[202:25.05]Come on, do it.
[202:26.29]Oh my god, fine.
[202:27.47]Never mind.
[202:45.87]The drip?
[202:55.73]Stop!
[202:56.63]Everybody stop!
[202:57.95]I'm warning them.
[202:58.88]I'm trying to warn them.
[203:08.16]And how did I drive by it?
[203:09.80]What's the diamond?
[203:10.32]Ooh, what's the- I wanna go to the diamond.
[203:17.61]No, I want to throw his head on the thing.
[203:21.87]I want to throw this person.
[203:35.84]Can I rob this place?
[203:41.49]Jewelry stores allow you to customize your character.
[203:44.49]Oh.
[203:49.19]Grab your weapon?
[203:59.18]I gotta get the... Why?
[204:06.92]Okay, I guess I'll take... Do you have any silver?
[204:11.47]You guys have any silver?
[204:14.19]I'm looking for sterling silver.
[204:21.50]Why can't I?
[204:22.44]She's got a knife.
[204:25.18]Why does this not work?
[204:26.08]This thing fucking sucks.
[204:31.07]Why does this not work?
[204:47.88]She took a picture of me.
[204:49.00]What the fuck?
[204:51.85]She thought if you have a knife, you're just going to take pictures?
[204:55.09]What are you doing?
[204:57.57]Give me this register.
[205:12.07]No, I'm slowing down.
[205:17.38]They have to get back in the car.
[205:18.54]Give me the money that's in there!
[205:26.13]How do I break it?
[205:43.15]How do I... Do I have to step on it?
[206:02.55]This thing's not broken.
[206:14.50]It's not broken.
[206:21.00]What the fuck, dude?
[206:22.12]Is it... Can I... Tell me if I'm wrong or not.
[206:24.62]Can I actually do this?
[206:32.13]You can't.
[206:32.77]Okay, well what the hell am I doing?
[206:46.29]Alright.
[206:47.59]Get the cops off.
[207:02.96]You have to do fine aim at the store clerk to do a robbery.
[207:05.50]Okay.
[207:28.19]No, don't play the fucking harmonica.
[207:29.67]I want to eat the food.
[207:34.43]How do I eat the food?
[207:44.46]Eat it!
[207:44.82]Get out of here!
[208:21.24]They're outside.
[208:21.80]She just went through the window.
[208:34.00]She went through the passenger window.
[208:37.55]What?
[208:37.75]Who is she shooting at?
[208:45.75]I'm very confused as to what just happened.
[208:48.87]Oh, it's this guy.
[208:49.65]I'm going to see how this plays out.
[209:02.94]Here he comes.
[209:16.84]We're out.
[209:21.44]Oh, shit.
[209:21.96]It's here.
[209:22.32]What is this?
[209:25.78]Car shop?
[209:29.43]Get that off the screen.
[209:30.89]I don't know.
[209:31.35]What is this?
[209:31.79]Go find a swindle.
[209:33.17]Oh, I found it.
[209:34.45]It's right there.
[209:50.31]Why are you going so fast?
[209:53.09]They're gone.
[209:59.08]No, don't.
[210:00.26]No, do not.
[210:01.82]No, don't.
[210:05.64]Shoot the gun.
[210:07.42]Shoot the gun, you imbecile.
[210:17.98]You're the worst gamer alive.
[210:19.66]No, I'm not.
[210:20.44]I lost them.
[210:29.35]Where are they, though?
[210:30.05]They show up randomly, don't they?
[210:33.65]Five of them were just on the screen.
[210:51.21]Come on, spawn one.
[210:57.71]What am I doing?
[210:58.36]I'm looking for one of these cars.
[211:06.21]Sorry, I had to blink really hard.
[211:07.33]My eyes are watering.
[211:20.25]Is there no other one of these cars?
[211:21.49]I was trying to bait the cop to go over there and they didn't.
[211:38.58]Why won't one of these show up?
[211:39.54]Please!
[211:50.36]They show up in different districts.
[211:55.60]Here we go.
[211:56.16]This one.
[211:58.74]Just a million.
[211:59.72]What the hell?
[212:12.04]They desperately... Just get out.
[212:14.32]Get out, please.
[212:14.76]I'm not going to kill anybody.
[212:19.47]This thing is so slow.
[212:22.25]This is the slowest car ever.
[212:26.27]There's a lot of extra weight in here.
[212:37.66]I just joined.
[212:43.02]Why is he an ogre?
[212:52.67]Thousand bucks.
[212:53.29]Nice.
[213:01.44]Oh, I can't wait later on.
[213:03.60]I'm just gonna get... I'm gonna get takeout and watch Ernest Saves Christmas.
[213:07.78]An absolute fucking classic movie.
[213:10.24]I can't wait.
[213:10.66]Oh, let's go over here.
[213:22.01]Because I can do one... Let me... Should I do one of the main missions?
[213:35.16]Yeah, if you... I mean, if you don't watch Ernest Saves Christmas in the next, like, couple weeks before... Like, um... Don't come... Don't come back to this stream.
[213:43.46]I'm just... I have to be very, very realistic.
[213:45.07]Okay.
[213:46.59]If you do not watch Ernest Saves Christmas, like in the next three or four weeks, don't come back here.
[214:06.46]What if you don't celebrate Christmas?
[214:08.72]Alright.
[214:09.62]Well, let me rephrase that.
[214:11.16]Let me rephrase that.
[214:12.06]I mean, if you celebrate, if you celebrate Christmas, okay, then you don't watch Ernest Saves Christmas.
[214:18.26]Alright.
[214:19.59]I'm a fucking idiot.
[214:20.27]I'm an idiot.
[214:21.05]I'll take that loss.
[214:24.91]If you don't, okay, if you celebrate Christmas, you don't watch Ernest Saves Christmas, then you're in deep shit if you come back here.
[214:40.37]In fact, you know what?
[214:41.01]No, let's go even further.
[214:42.01]You gotta go watch all the Ernest movies in the next month.
[214:44.57]Or don't come back.
[214:51.08]By the way, you better get started.
[214:52.30]There's like 15 of them.
[215:00.06]No!
[215:05.52]Come on!
[215:06.82]You can do this!
[215:08.94]You can do it!
[215:10.86]You can do it!
[215:13.36]Come on, please!
[215:15.10]I know you're capable of doing this.
[215:16.56]No!
[215:32.67]No!
[215:41.39]Come on!
[215:43.49]Get the fuck out of here!
[215:50.63]Get up there!
[215:55.26]Get up there!
[215:59.08]You piece of shit!
[216:05.12]Did that kill me?
[216:18.63]Here we go.
[216:21.17]What's this thing?
[216:27.59]This is my girl.
[216:29.29]It's a garage guy.
[216:34.48]Can I eat one of these?
[216:35.10]Alright, this mission is.
[216:46.41]A brotherhood mission.
[216:47.45]What's the one behind it?
[216:49.20]It's two.
[216:49.56]Is that inside?
[216:52.86]When are you going to do an earnest tier list movie?
[216:57.62]Soon.
[217:01.25]I mean, it's not going to be very long content.
[217:03.87]Because every single one of them is an S tier.
[217:10.99]What in the name of God just happened in here?
[217:16.41]What the fuck?
[217:21.08]He was doing like... This person has to be stopped.
[217:25.56]Right?
[217:26.28]I have to stop this person.
[217:27.08]I'm trying to save you!
[217:43.99]Gang strongholds are centers of operation for each gang.
[217:46.27]Find and wipe them all out to deal hard blows to each gang.
[217:48.93]Okay.
[217:52.68]That person was on my team?
[217:53.68]He was red on the mini-map.
[217:55.20]I don't think so.
[217:56.50]Oh, we're doing this shit again?
[217:57.58]I don't want to do this.
[218:13.36]No, I don't want... I'm not killing anybody.
[218:28.88]No, I refuse.
[218:35.91]Except for these two.
[218:41.21]Is this Dark Souls area?
[218:42.61]It is.
[218:46.01]Yeah, this is like Blight.
[218:47.17]This is like the entrance to Blighttown.
[218:52.21]The bridges, the little corridors, the little ledges.
[219:02.71]Oh, I can't wait to play Elden Ring.
[219:03.95]Do I have to even be hostile?
[219:16.70]Wait, that's not- I don't have to destroy that.
[219:20.87]Alright, I'm not- look, I'm just- let me go.
[219:24.27]Holy shit, there's so many people here, are you kidding me?
[219:27.13]There's like a- there's like 500 people here.
[219:28.93]How am I gonna do this?
[219:38.41]I don't even want to be violent!
[219:44.25]I don't want- I don't- I want non-violence!
[219:53.55]I just need to get... Okay, hold on.
[219:56.07]I'm so fat I can just run into them.
[220:00.21]Perfect.
[220:01.21]Nobody has to get hurt.
[220:09.65]What the fuck?
[220:10.05]It didn't work on this one.
[220:18.71]Good.
[220:19.13]Alright, we're done.
[220:20.68]We're done.
[220:20.96]We're done.
[220:21.18]We're done.
[220:21.46]We're done.
[220:21.68]I don't have to do anything.
[220:23.57]Jim Varney's character, Ernest P. Worrell, was created by the Nashville Advertising Agency, and he used it, oh yeah, he did local commercials.
[220:42.14]the best one is when he has his hands on the windowsill he's like hey verne he leans in he's talking about milk he's like I have for you the best creamiest yogurt in all the world and then uh verne grabs it from his hand and the windowsill lands like flies down and hits him in the hands and he's like
[221:08.96]Entire Ernest advertising line is perfect.
[221:10.84]He's on a ladder at one point, he gets pushed back, and he falls off the roof.
[221:15.85]Immune to ads?
[221:18.39]I'm sorry, I will buy whatever Ernest tells me to.
[221:21.01]I don't care what it is.
[221:30.04]Need to have more respect for this one?
[221:31.44]Okay, what about, what's this?
[221:40.98]Did I lose respect?
[221:41.96]I already know all this.
[221:59.49]There's a train in the game.
[222:00.31]Alright.
[222:00.93]We found a new thing to play with.
[222:04.81]Not yet.
[222:07.85]Which one's the...
[222:18.48]Get out of here, you fucking dead.
[222:20.64]Excuse me?
[222:22.72]What was that for?
[222:35.76]Yeah, you know what I can't understand?
[222:37.06]Uh, look.
[222:38.44]You know how movies over the years like they get like, oh cult followings or whatever.
[222:42.75]It is insulting to me that most of the Ernest movies have like 20% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[222:51.03]I honestly don't understand.
[222:53.07]I can't understand.
[222:53.84]That's unbelievable to me.
[223:04.58]Because they're not good?
[223:05.42]What you just said is unbelievable to me.
[223:08.42]What you just said is very hurtful to me.
[223:11.57]What you just said is very hurtful to me.
[223:17.03]Stop.
[223:17.29]Don't say that.
[223:30.26]I want that bike.
[223:31.32]Not that one.
[223:31.80]That one's dirty.
[223:32.82]I want the one that's clean and hasn't been used or destroyed.
[223:40.46]Ooh, this- Chop Chop!
[223:44.78]You fucking idiot.
[223:51.27]No!
[223:52.35]Hold on, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.
[223:55.89]What's wrong with me?
[223:56.55]What am I doing?
[223:57.97]What am I doing on the ground?
[223:59.57]What's wrong with my character?
[224:02.54]Uh... What?
[224:15.95]You were busted!
[224:16.67]A small amount of cash in the... That metal detector doesn't even work.
[224:32.34]Can I like take... Can I steal something?
[224:50.38]I'm not in trouble.
[224:52.80]Not yet.
[224:56.78]Move out of the way.
[224:57.44]I don't want to hit you.
[224:58.02]Damn it.
[225:08.11]A little bit further.
[225:09.79]Are you kidding me?
[225:22.51]Fine.
[225:29.75]The chairs.
[225:30.75]I just like home alone to this guy.
[225:35.68]This guy can't even move.
[225:36.42]He can't even get up.
[225:41.50]How come I'm not in trouble for that?
[225:42.44]Okay.
[225:53.84]What happened?
[225:54.28]What exploded?
[226:25.78]I didn't get in trouble.
[226:28.48]Alright, I'm gonna go do one of the missions I can do.
[226:36.65]Oh, there's one at a chop shop.
[226:42.41]That was unbelievable that that happened.
[226:45.43]Yeah, I even tried to break.
[226:46.79]That was actually unbelievable.
[226:48.69]That was unbelievable.
[227:02.63]Come on, dude!
[227:04.73]Stop!
[227:06.79]I thought I could go right through it.
[227:08.00]It's a fucking... It's a white picket fence.
[227:11.70]It's not... Like, concrete.
[227:21.97]There it is.
[227:24.87]2,000 bucks.
[227:25.11]Holy shit.
[227:25.99]I should just do this for a little while.
[227:45.27]Oh, shit.
[228:02.58]Okay.
[228:03.81]What can I... I need more respect.
[228:05.17]I guess I'm more close, too.
[228:11.17]This one is trailblazing?
[228:13.09]I'm curious what that is.
[228:23.12]That guy didn't even move.
[228:24.06]Holy shit.
[228:25.34]Where do you get the hamburger?
[228:31.46]I want that.
[228:43.43]Alright, don't do that anymore.
[228:51.43]I bet you you get points for riding a wheelie for a long time though, right?
[228:53.57]If I were to take a guess.
[228:59.44]Alright, what is this?
[229:10.77]Remember, if you do not take damage in the next 10 minutes, we will take 200 million off the debt.
[229:15.55]Okay.
[229:15.77]Who cares about the debt anymore?
[229:17.29]An old meme.
[229:17.53]Oh, you know what I got?
[229:39.72]I got almonds right here.
[229:41.28]Let's go for it.
[229:42.88]Oh, yeah.
[229:45.45]Oh, yeah.
[229:46.67]Those are crunchy.
[229:48.73]Yep.
[229:53.57]Mm-hmm.
[229:53.77]I have to be careful.
[230:01.62]Because these have wasabi and soy sauce on them.
[230:06.34]Which means...
[230:08.69]You literally can't pick them up with your fucking hands.
[230:11.63]Like every other goddamn snack that prides itself on having a bunch of shit all over it that gets all over you.
[230:18.65]Oh, dude, you gotta eat Takis, dude.
[230:20.43]They're the best.
[230:21.17]They're so good.
[230:21.83]No, fuck those things.
[230:23.47]You can't eat them.
[230:25.02]You cannot eat Takis unless you, like, use a fork or, like, chopsticks or something.
[230:31.48]Why is there so much shit all over them?
[230:38.48]Dude, just eat chopsticks.
[230:39.46]What if I don't have a pair of chopsticks with me?
[230:41.18]Am I just going to carry chopsticks with me everywhere?
[230:52.22]Takis are one of the... Okay, seriously.
[230:54.24]If you... I put a tier list of snacks in a place where if I eat one of them, I have to wash my hands.
[231:04.11]Like, if you pick up one Taki with your fingers, you have to wash your hands.
[231:08.67]I don't know.
[231:09.55]Fuck, they could be some almonds.
[231:13.30]Baked Lay's don't do that.
[231:15.46]Baked Lay's are the best complete S++ tier snack.
[231:19.96]They're the best.
[231:22.12]I don't have to do that with Baked Lay's.
[231:29.90]You know, they did a study where they took a bunch of people and did an IQ test to them.
[231:34.56]And I think the study was somewhere in California.
[231:38.11]It had like 500 people in it.
[231:39.57]And they did an IQ test with everybody.
[231:42.05]And then they asked what their favorite snack was.
[231:46.03]And most of the people that had over 120 IQ baked lays were top three in the rankings.
[231:53.95]It was maybe somewhere in California.
[231:56.44]It was one of the institutes.
[232:01.96]Which is like, it's kind of interesting to think about that.
[232:04.24]That's not real study?
[232:12.91]What are you talking about?
[232:15.19]Okay, let's go.
[232:17.11]Race to the finish for cash and respect.
[232:22.68]I believe you?
[232:23.26]Yeah, why wouldn't you?
[232:25.34]Okay, bonus seconds earned from ramming people and cars.
[232:29.18]Well, that's easy.
[232:29.74]I'd do that without trying anyways.
[232:31.24]This is fucked up.
[232:52.90]No, the study was a completely peer-reviewed, independent third-party study.
[233:12.83]I'm not running over enough people.
[233:14.91]Or cars, for that matter.
[233:24.77]I didn't have to do anything.
[233:26.49]Go!
[233:37.74]How did that not hit everybody?
[233:45.08]There was a study in 2017 that did an IQ test on 5,000 people and they asked them who their favorite Twitch streamer was and anyone with under 70 IQ said it was you.
[233:53.30]IQ doesn't fucking even matter.
[233:55.78]It's like a completely stupid outdated thing to like have.
[233:58.16]So whatever you say, who cares?
[234:00.58]That was fucking cool, but it didn't do anything for me.
[234:06.60]Please just hit the dumb.
[234:11.20]There's too much smoke on the screen.
[234:12.94]I can't see anything.
[234:25.46]But isn't it kind of weird, though, that, like, when I'm walking around town and walking around the city, I see these, like, businessmen walking around with, like, suits on.
[234:32.80]They're on the phone.
[234:34.42]I see, like, doctors walking around with, like, the stethoscopes around their necks, like, walking around, talking on the phone and stuff.
[234:39.89]And they have, like, a bag of baked lays in their other hand.
[234:43.25]That's so surprising, apparently.
[234:46.31]Is it?
[235:04.17]Business man does not equal intelligence.
[235:17.94]What are you talking about?
[235:18.66]That guy has a tie-on.
[235:19.64]I trust him.
[235:20.16]I feel like that's something Peter Griffin would say.
[235:26.55]I'm sorry.
[235:26.93]Alright, I got money.
[235:31.89]Let's use it.
[235:38.07]No, he had a chai on Lois.
[235:39.43]I trust him.
[235:48.87]Do you guys remember?
[235:49.45]I completely forgot about this.
[235:50.61]Do you remember when I did like the... Do the entire Family Guy thing?
[235:55.15]With like the weird Family Guy piano thing in the background?
[235:58.86]That... I deleted that from my memory.
[236:06.62]I don't remember even what was happening.
[236:08.74]What was that?
[236:09.24]I was reading like a script or something, right?
[236:11.69]Oh, I was reading JermaCraft as the different characters.
[236:25.24]Right.
[236:25.58]That was so fucking weird.
[236:35.18]I tried to do it with every character.
[236:36.72]Oh, come on.
[236:47.73]I was at work laughing during that.
[236:50.31]Hopefully I didn't get you in trouble.
[236:53.48]That was traumatizing.
[237:04.66]Now you have to do it as the Attack on Titan character.
[237:08.60]What, with like Attack on Titan music playing in the background?
[237:21.43]I don't know about that.
[237:23.15]I'm not so sure about that.
[237:24.47]What does this want me to do?
[237:31.90]Why does it want me to go down here?
[237:36.36]GPS is so fucked up right now.
[237:38.42]What?
[237:38.64]Why?
[237:40.96]It's like, just go in the ocean and swim there.
[237:44.99]What?
[237:51.05]That very clearly was go down the staircase.
[237:59.41]It really was.
[238:03.98]You saw it wrap around the staircase.
[238:05.54]I'm not crazy.
[238:06.38]I followed it because I don't know.
[238:09.20]What is... There's such a red marker over there.
[238:16.01]Oh, my fucking God, Jeremy, please.
[238:21.13]Look, it's on the staircase.
[238:23.25]There's not even a road here.
[238:27.01]What the fuck?
[238:35.00]They did this on The Office?
[238:37.02]I've never seen The Office.
[238:50.79]Why is your character dressed as the guy from Happy Wheels?
[239:07.41]This GPS is fucked!
[239:09.77]What is it talking about?
[239:11.09]Why does it want me to do this?
[239:13.94]I don't understand.
[239:17.46]I'm just gonna go this way.
[239:18.50]This doesn't make any sense.
[239:34.11]Dude, somebody's fucking with me right now.
[239:36.73]The game is just messing with my head.
[239:39.91]What is this?
[239:41.01]Where is this telling me to go?
[239:42.57]I'm going around in a circle?
[239:43.85]I'm just walking.
[239:50.54]This is where I wanted to go.
[239:53.14]Was here, right?
[239:54.86]Where's the hamburger place?
[239:57.38]Yeah, it's the mall.
[239:58.57]Okay.
[239:59.57]I was right.
[240:06.39]Nobody here.
[240:06.77]Go Skeeters!
[240:25.16]Alright, so you said I could rob this place?
[240:30.92]Let me buy something first.
[240:32.22]I need some new clothes.
[240:37.61]Game crashed.
[240:38.95]No.
[240:39.13]When was the last time I saved it?
[240:42.53]Shit.
[240:45.11]I think it was not that far away.
[240:47.07]I wasn't in a mission or anything.
[240:50.40]God damn it.
[240:51.20]Why?
[240:51.44]I need the music again.
[241:10.87]Yeah, that's right here.
[241:12.47]Alright, we're good.
[241:17.39]You said you saved?
[241:18.09]I did.
[241:20.65]No, yeah.
[241:21.37]Yeah, this is fine.
[241:23.15]I'm going to do this mission here.
[241:25.88]Either Ronan... What should I do?
[241:28.20]Does it matter?
[241:28.62]Ronan?
[241:30.96]Ronan's the one with the people with the bikes and the katanas.
[241:36.86]Let's see.
[241:37.54]I'm curious.
[241:40.88]What's up with the dollhouse?
[241:42.30]Dollhouse my ass.
[241:44.08]This is how we gonna fuck up the Ronin.
[241:46.34]This'll be good.
[241:48.04]Trust me, it is.
[241:50.17]The Ronin have a stake in Poseidon's palace, so I figure hitting their biggest money maker is a good way to show them we not fucking around.
[241:56.57]Okay, so what's the plan?
[241:58.25]You and I enter the casino here.
[242:00.33]Once inside, we need to distract this security guard.
[242:02.89]I was thinking you could catch me cheating or some shit like that.
[242:05.66]Anyway, while the guards concerned with throwing me out, Gatto sneaked in through this security door.
[242:10.50]Don't worry, I already got today's passcode from the blackjack dealer Shaundi's fucking.
[242:15.14]Now once inside, Gatto had to sneak past the guards to cut the power.
[242:18.95]And when that happens, we only have about 45 seconds before the backup generator turns on.
[242:23.97]He's eating Takis.
[242:24.43]No.
[242:24.49]I just think of the red dust being absorbed into my intestinal tract.
[242:26.61]I, like, don't want that to happen.
[242:27.55]You know what I mean?
[242:43.93]If you eat, like, a half a bag of Takis or whatever, like, heavily red food coloring stuff, I don't, like, want, like, red, like, red dust absorbed into my fucking intestines.
[242:53.37]I don't know.
[242:53.95]It's probably fine, but I don't want to do that.
[243:00.35]Don't you, like, think of, like, just, like, drinking... I don't know.
[243:03.00]Okay, let me be... I gotta make this clear.
[243:06.46]I'm not saying that this is weird or gross.
[243:07.98]I mean, I bet it is.
[243:10.14]Is my health going down?
[243:15.81]How can I become like a Redditor like you?
[243:20.66]Hmm.
[243:22.38]Well, hold on.
[243:27.26]Okay.
[243:28.24]So, listen.
[243:31.82]Anything that has a heavy amount of powder, or like food coloring, or like food dye, you do understand.
[243:38.82]Now this is not, this is not me making it up.
[243:41.70]This is factual information.
[243:43.20]This is just real shit.
[243:45.71]Red food dye comes from two distinct sources.
[243:49.73]One is bugs.
[243:52.15]Like crushed up bugs.
[243:53.95]They derive it from that.
[243:55.55]And the other one, I believe, now correct me if I'm wrong, is like petroleum.
[244:01.18]It's like from gasoline or something, isn't it?
[244:03.74]It's like a chemical they pull out of it.
[244:14.45]A kid named Shogo Okuji.
[244:16.24]Now, he probably spends more time on his hair than he does on his bike.
[244:18.62]So, I'm telling you, I prefer the bugs.
[244:20.84]I would rather eat the bugs.
[244:22.16]I'd rather eat the red food coloring bugs.
[244:24.72]I don't want the other one.
[244:25.46]Hey, where's Pierce?
[244:27.49]Pierce is picking up some of the other saints and meeting us there.
[244:30.37]I figure we can get the party started without him.
[244:36.23]It's a petroleum byproduct.
[244:38.66]Right.
[244:38.98]Okay.
[244:40.08]So, if I have an opportunity to eat the bugs or the petroleum byproduct, which one are you going to pick?
[244:51.99]Correct answer is grow your own food.
[244:56.25]God.
[245:07.37]Oh shit, I wasn't looking.
[245:14.94]Bugs are a different byproduct.
[245:17.44]Oh my god, I've hit every car.
[245:19.08]Okay.
[245:23.20]But I don't know, I just... I just feel something is so unnatural about... I know people love, like, Flamin' Hot Cheetos and stuff, but man, like... I know there's, like, the blue Takis and shit, but I... Oh, I want the bright blue fuckin' Ecto Cooler Takis!
[245:41.00]What's going on here?
[245:44.14]Vanilla flavoring is squeezed from a beaver's anus.
[245:50.71]God, if you get like real vanilla, like a vanilla fucking plant, whatever it is.
[245:54.40]What is vanilla?
[245:54.88]It's like a plant.
[245:56.54]It's a herb.
[245:57.24]What is vanilla?
[245:57.92]It's a plant.
[245:59.98]Oh, shit.
[246:00.48]I just think I did.
[246:01.12]No.
[246:07.38]It's a bean.
[246:08.00]Yeah.
[246:10.26]We just walk.
[246:10.74]What do we do here?
[246:17.32]Take out.
[246:17.82]Okay.
[246:22.23]I'm gonna be like the old person at the casino.
[246:24.99]Can I play?
[246:46.37]Can I play?
[246:55.23]I can't play.
[247:07.54]What the fuck did I just... What's going on?
[247:17.31]Oh, no.
[247:18.53]It's the guy from Casino.
[247:23.29]Get out.
[247:23.67]Get him out.
[247:24.07]Get him out.
[247:24.35]Get him out.
[247:24.59]Get him out.
[247:27.48]I got shot so many times.
[247:29.04]What the fuck are you doing, dude?
[247:31.10]I don't want to... This is... Oh.
[247:33.56]I already got out.
[247:38.95]Pasta Italiana.
[247:41.69]I don't want to shoot...
[248:13.03]Guard?
[248:13.91]Ooh, well, he uses the what?
[248:18.78]Oh my goodness, that hurts.
[248:20.00]Oh, no!
[248:38.74]Whoa, Larry!
[248:40.10]Larry Diamond!
[248:41.53]Whoa!
[248:43.59]I love doing the Larry David.
[248:44.57]I can do it really well.
[248:57.07]You're taking a long time to do this.
[248:58.95]Hurry up.
[249:01.87]No, that was Jeff.
[249:03.35]Oh, what do you mean?
[249:04.65]They both do the same thing.
[249:05.57]They both do that.
[249:06.23]What do you mean?
[249:09.49]Oh, no.
[249:19.18]When are you going to put Christmas music on?
[249:20.36]We already did the Christmas music thing.
[249:28.24]You get out of here with your fucking unbrushed teeth, you fucking idiot.
[249:34.47]Alright, should I do a Kirby Enthusiasm tier list?
[249:37.13]Because Susie's up at like S tier.
[249:52.84]Are we good?
[249:54.19]Are we dead?
[249:58.61]Why does everything need a tier list?
[249:59.61]Because I'm, I don't know, I'm trying to make the zoomers think I'm cool.
[250:16.80]Well, they call the cops.
[250:18.34]Big surprise there.
[250:20.79]I already think you're cool.
[250:21.75]Oh, thanks.
[250:22.19]I don't have to try anymore.
[250:29.81]One of my favorite curb... I'm watching the current season, right?
[250:34.64]One of my favorite jokes this season, if you haven't seen it, but you know, spoilers, hold your ears closed for a second.
[250:41.32]When they're talking about cheese.
[250:44.83]They're talking about feta cheese, and Leon's like, I don't even think mice like that shit.
[250:49.93]He's like, you gotta be in a specific mood for cheese.
[250:51.93]I don't think even mice like that shit.
[250:55.69]The way it's delivery is fucking hilarious.
[251:06.52]Leon is absolutely S tier as well.
[251:15.66]Every single thing that Leon says is just as hysterical.
[251:33.07]Are they going to leave us alone?
[251:37.85]The person's sneaking back onto the car.
[251:41.70]Stop tearing shit, it's cringe.
[251:43.12]Alright, I won't.
[251:44.26]He's knocking on the door.
[252:12.94]Over there.
[252:22.38]So rude.
[252:23.58]Sword.
[252:28.27]Listen Junichi.
[252:30.73]I know you're having a hard time adjusting to the way I run things here.
[252:37.62]Oh God, that... Um... Okay.
[252:38.44]Alright.
[252:38.64]Ooh.
[252:38.84]$500 a day.
[253:11.82]You guys said that the Ronin missions are the best ones.
[253:13.38]Should I just do another one?
[253:14.28]Oh, I don't have enough respect.
[253:27.89]What's your favorite Curb episode?
[253:29.29]The entirety of Season 7.
[253:33.12]Which, I mean, I count that as one episode because I watched the whole season back to back.
[253:37.84]So I usually watch that in one or two sittings.
[253:40.61]If I ever go back and rewatch.
[253:47.01]You can gamble in the casino.
[253:50.57]Really?
[253:59.92]Where is it?
[254:03.50]Yes, you can.
[254:04.40]Is it just the Ronin stronghold?
[254:09.22]Don't tell him that.
[254:10.14]Who told him?
[254:13.84]Where is it?
[254:14.14]It's not on the map.
[254:19.25]Really.
[254:22.65]Um.
[254:29.87]Where is it?
[254:30.27]I want to go to it.
[254:34.04]Do you like Seinfeld?
[254:36.04]I mean, I like Seinfeld.
[254:37.08]I think it was alright.
[254:38.38]It was good.
[254:38.80]There's a lot of really like classic episodes, but I think Curb is funnier than Seinfeld.
[254:44.11]Somebody just wanted to punch me in the face probably, but I think it's like a more fun show to me.
[254:57.32]I don't think it's by a whole lot.
[255:00.50]It's not astronomically better.
[255:04.06]But I think it's... I laughed more times at Curb than I did at Seinfeld.
[255:15.61]You know, I have to be really, really honest with you guys.
[255:18.49]It's the laugh track.
[255:21.35]I can't take any show seriously with a laugh track.
[255:23.83]I just... It ruins it.
[255:29.93]Where's this casino?
[255:36.98]You guys are actually not going to tell me where it is.
[255:48.47]I'll find it.
[255:50.17]It's Poseidon's Palace.
[255:51.23]Is that on here?
[255:54.87]Oh, whatever.
[255:55.29]I don't care.
[255:56.99]I'm going to go do this mission down here.
[256:03.60]The laugh track on the stream.
[256:17.13]No, not that one.
[256:18.07]Oh my fucking god.
[256:27.10]I don't even want to be doing this.
[256:32.42]I can't have a laugh track.
[256:33.73]I need to queue it up and record it and stuff.
[256:40.49]Um...
[256:44.03]Yeah, and you can't just remove a laugh track either.
[256:46.03]It's like, oh, what if they did a thing where they remastered some of these old shows?
[256:50.37]It's like the weird, awkward pauses that a lot of these shows do when there's laughing.
[256:55.14]Kind of like when any celebrity, doesn't matter how big or small they are, shows up on SNL, they walk onto the stage.
[257:02.38]And there's just the clapping and cheering while they just go, yep, okay, yep, mm, yeah, mm-hmm.
[257:09.37]And everybody just sits there and stares at nothing for like 20 to 30 straight seconds.
[257:17.00]It kind of takes me away.
[257:24.20]Whose door is this?
[257:29.40]Okay.
[257:34.59]Find and take out the individual listed on the hit list.
[257:37.85]Okay.
[257:39.13]Use the dossier to figure out how to find the target.
[257:42.01]Then use your minimap to track and kill them.
[257:46.18]listen up I've got some people that need to be taken care of you take them out and there's something in it for you okay and there's a security guy for the trailer park okay orderly the downtown hospital this is a lifetime skeeters fan um okay we're going after the mascot
[258:17.01]Buy one of each item from the Freckle Bitches menu, and he'll show up to try and sell you on some franchise opportunity?
[258:24.18]Okay.
[258:28.26]So we're gonna go get this guy?
[258:44.88]Where is this taking me?
[258:49.11]Where is Freckled Bitches?
[258:51.21]Oh, right here.
[258:51.85]Okay.
[258:57.46]So, order everything on the menu.
[259:01.44]I got it.
[259:23.52]Oof.
[259:36.65]Alright.
[259:37.15]Order one of each thing on the menu.
[259:39.35]Wait, it's a drive-thru.
[259:40.07]Okay.
[259:53.91]Order one of everything?
[259:55.13]This is expensive.
[259:58.08]Okay, I ordered everything.
[260:09.15]Where is he?
[260:16.35]Does he show up?
[260:17.55]Oh, there he is.
[260:26.38]I thought they just fucking ran him over.
[260:38.56]Um... What?
[260:42.57]How do they know it's me?
[260:43.69]How do they know I'm doing anything bad?
[261:00.41]You stupid game.
[261:02.26]What's this music place?
[261:04.56]Wait, can I buy instruments?
[261:05.50]Oh my god, can I buy instruments?
[261:12.55]Music stores.
[261:13.59]They sell songs.
[261:14.83]Oh, never mind.
[261:16.71]Well, can't listen to any of these.
[261:33.56]The casino is in the hotels and marina district, Middle Top Island.
[261:41.27]Really?
[261:44.11]Middle Top Island?
[261:47.71]Oh shit, look at that.
[262:08.84]I'm gonna turn this 10 grand into 50 grand.
[262:11.90]And I'm buying one of those cool cards.
[262:13.26]I can't be trusted.
[262:26.91]Play some Kevin.
[262:37.67]Oh, you know what I watched, and I could not believe what I was watching?
[262:41.76]I watched Home Sweet Home Alone.
[262:44.38]Like, the Home Alone sort of, like, sequel-y, reboot-y, sequel-y thing.
[262:50.65]Um... The movie was awful.
[262:55.29]That whole movie, the whole point of Home Alone was, lookit, we're gonna set up a bunch of, like, crazy things that happen in a house, and there's, like, traps and stuff.
[263:02.34]The first hour of that movie was just kind of like a Will Ferrell movie where they didn't have Will Ferrell as the main character.
[263:10.06]And nothing happens for like an hour and 15 minutes.
[263:21.51]That's the first movie too.
[263:24.30]Whoa, whoa, hold on a minute here.
[263:26.74]The first Home Alone...
[263:29.56]was a godly tier higher than that.
[263:32.68]And where is this thing taking me?
[263:34.16]Oh.
[263:40.06]Oh, fuck.
[263:40.58]That person's gonna be so pissed.
[263:42.70]There was somebody in the chat like 10, 20 minutes ago that said, stop doing tier shit.
[263:47.05]It's cringe.
[263:47.65]And I'm like, alright.
[263:48.35]And then I just did it again.
[263:49.21]Oh, there's the waypoint.
[263:51.69]Okay.
[263:52.45]So where's the casino?
[263:53.01]There's the mall.
[264:05.83]The left?
[264:13.60]Having opinions is not a tier list.
[264:19.00]I know, but we've recently did the tier list, so it's like in my mind.
[264:22.74]Is this illegal?
[264:34.79]I guess not, not really.
[264:48.61]Blackjack, can I play slots?
[264:52.59]Oh, you can only play blackjack or poker.
[264:54.69]Alright, blackjack.
[264:59.33]Let's go.
[265:00.31]Oh, yeah, let's go.
[265:08.68]What's the max bet?
[265:09.90]Oh no.
[265:13.36]What's the max bet?
[265:21.54]There is no max bet.
[265:29.91]I didn't mean to do that.
[265:30.83]I didn't holy I meant it back it but the stupid stupid switch thing where the I was back is a You know I'm saying I wanted to hit B. I wanted to hit B. I'm gonna win this hand I think but I wanted to go back because I wanted to save Stan please oh, thank fucking god, okay, I Wanted to save it before I did this oh
[266:01.21]17 versus an 8.
[266:01.61]Stay.
[266:02.49]Oh, that's too bad.
[266:03.87]It's this one, right?
[266:11.71]Is it this one?
[266:16.31]Which one is it?
[266:19.17]I don't remember.
[266:29.84]What?
[266:39.33]What are you talking about?
[266:39.95]I just saved it inside of there.
[266:41.53]It doesn't save your location.

[267:09.59]I'll be honest, when we were walking behind this guy, I thought he had like a rooster mask on.
[267:20.24]Does this give me respect?
[267:23.82]Now he wants to fight.
[267:24.46]Okay.
[267:24.56]Okay.

[267:46.60]I don't have any bullets.
[267:54.74]Do I get respect for that?
[268:01.75]I don't need very much respect.
[268:07.07]Wait.
[268:08.67]Okay, here we go.

[276:25.60]A really itchy eye.
[276:27.94]Six.
[276:30.00]I'll get there.
[276:43.16]I work quick.
[276:50.95]Go to the casino?
[277:00.05]I'm working on it.
[277:00.95]I need money to go to the casino, don't you understand?
[277:20.83]And I'm gonna get trapped there.
[277:21.89]I can't go there.
[277:34.26]Oh shit.
[277:36.04]Easy.
[277:47.46]Come on!
[278:00.03]Do it!
[278:10.55]This person's... Wait, what?
[278:13.55]I can't bring that person back to life?
[278:15.51]Level 7.
[278:15.77]Go to the casino.
[278:31.64]Don't worry, I will.
[278:35.40]Where is this?
[278:35.94]Up top?
[278:37.49]Where's all the train tracks?
[278:41.11]EMT has 10.
[278:41.53]Okay.
[278:42.57]Well, I'm almost there.
[278:45.03]What's this movie star one?
[278:51.72]Dude, what is in the way?
[279:08.40]I thought that person was going to punch me.
[279:13.11]That's not what I wanted.
[279:19.01]One more.
[279:29.71]Good.
[279:30.54]A thousand bucks.
[279:31.32]This is better than doing any missions.
[279:34.62]This is not the ambulance.
[279:36.96]I thought this was the ambulance.
[279:37.98]I'm an idiot.
[279:38.51]I'm sorry.
[279:45.51]You're not getting any respect?
[279:46.40]I'm getting a lot of money.
[279:49.28]Look, it's white and red.
[279:50.24]It was an easy mistake.
[279:51.00]It has a huge back.
[280:09.30]Are you high?
[280:11.78]Yeah.
[280:15.98]Yo, bro, are you?
[280:21.35]Do not run those people over.
[280:22.29]Whoever cleans up these nurses must have great jobs.
[280:52.64]I got five minutes to do this shit.
[281:01.30]I'll go this way.
[281:09.97]How come the number of victims is increasing but you don't have to save them?
[281:12.83]That's a good question.
[281:18.49]Nothing's wrong with the car.
[281:20.67]It's dragging on the ground.
[281:25.28]Something's wrong with the back left tire.
[281:31.22]Um... Are you serious?
[281:47.81]Okay.
[282:01.50]Oh no.
[282:08.20]I'm going a really dumb way.
[282:18.84]Why would you shoot at an ambulance here?
[282:20.72]Come on, stop it.
[282:23.36]I'm being followed.
[282:25.46]Oh fuck, I'm being followed.
[282:27.46]No, not anymore.
[282:29.04]Hold on, let me take care of you.
[282:33.15]Where are you?
[282:34.59]Where'd she go?
[282:36.05]Oh.
[282:36.59]Okay.
[282:39.82]She's in the back.
[282:43.02]Okay.
[282:43.38]Well, we got- I'll just bring her to the hospital.
[282:45.48]That's fine.
[282:51.05]This thing is smoking though.
[282:51.99]I have to be careful.
[283:04.33]There's only one more level left of this.
[283:05.65]I can't screw this up.
[283:13.19]She's not even on like a gurney or anything.
[283:15.51]Oh, no.
[283:17.31]Oh, no.
[283:18.93]Excuse me.
[283:20.23]They know she's in here.
[283:22.30]Oh, come on.
[283:23.16]Oh, no.
[283:24.34]This is bad.
[283:35.70]I don't got time for this shit.
[283:36.68]Fucking die!
[284:11.14]I feel like I'm making a specific YouTube video in like a first-person shooter.
[284:30.27]Like only using the one item that's like really hard to use.
[284:32.85]It's like a side item.
[284:34.59]Why would you ever use it?
[284:40.09]Oh my god, I saw headlights.
[284:42.30]You... I've had enough of this shit.
[284:56.06]Move.
[284:57.44]Oh man, this thing is beat the fuck up bad.
[285:01.78]This is bad.
[285:02.57]This is gonna be horrible.
[285:04.03]Is she still in the car?
[285:05.01]Is that the problem?
[285:08.36]This is not good.
[285:09.00]I have to take care of this now.
[285:09.88]I have to take care of this right now.
[285:18.94]Oh, come on.
[285:19.78]Is police here now?
[285:20.64]Are you helping me?
[285:25.64]I can't help.
[285:26.04]I don't know.
[285:30.88]Get away from me.
[285:32.02]They just don't stop.
[285:33.06]Is this Far Cry?
[285:34.16]What's happening?
[285:35.14]No, my ambulance.
[285:36.76]I need that.
[285:50.75]Game crashed.
[285:51.55]Fuck!
[285:56.57]No!
[285:56.93]Oh, all that money gone.
[286:03.72]Is there a quick save button?
[286:07.06]I can't just, like, save it in the middle of every single thing, every 15 seconds.
[286:13.34]Oh, that's sad.
[286:16.00]Getting into the car animation crashed it.
[286:19.28]It may have auto-saved?
[286:19.99]Ooh.
[286:23.62]Damn it.
[286:24.26]Please tell me there was an autosave after I completed that.
[286:27.12]Come on, please.
[286:30.42]No.
[286:31.52]I don't think so.
[286:33.56]That's very sad.
[286:37.62]That's very sad.
[286:44.64]Alright, well.
[286:45.18]We're going to have to do the thing where every five minutes you guys freak out and spam, spam.
[286:50.78]This sucks.
[286:51.16]I had like 15 grand.
[286:55.03]Damn it.
[286:56.65]I blame the Far Cry 6 bullshit.
[286:59.87]Where the enemies just spawn never-ending on top of you.
[287:03.81]I need respect.
[287:04.55]I'm going to get it.
[287:06.81]Somehow.
[287:07.87]What is this?
[287:09.87]Septic Avenger.
[287:11.21]I'm curious.
[287:12.85]Well, I think that went well.
[287:30.78]This game is a lot of fun, though.
[287:31.74]Alright, I'm going to take a quick poll in the chat.
[287:33.38]Do you want to see this again?
[287:36.99]Should I continue the playthrough of Saints Row 2?
[287:39.05]You guys having a good time?
[287:44.73]I'm having a good time.
[287:45.78]I think I'll do it again.
[287:54.95]So I got the community kind of gentleman of the road mod.
[287:58.49]Those do a lot of bug fixes and help with a lot of stuff.
[288:01.43]Is there anything else I should get to help make this more stable?
[288:06.09]Listen, we have to make this quick.
[288:07.70]What do you think?
[288:08.42]Stefan is having another one of the soirees today.
[288:11.46]And I'm not missing his pool boy this year.
[288:14.04]Here's the deal.
[288:14.68]There's a few things.
[288:15.34]Okay.
[288:15.62]I've been trying to sell real estate in this area for a month, but no one's buying because the property value is too high.
[288:21.70]There's nothing more than GOTR right now.
[288:23.67]Volition's making an official patch to fix it.
[288:25.99]What did you say?
[288:26.47]Spray sewage all over your targets.
[288:27.33]What the fuck?
[288:46.42]Arrival realtor has exclusive rights the new homes in Quinn Becca and new Henke you space to stop the truck Oh my god, this is ridiculous I hope those construction workers have a sense of humor That's it to do damage The safety rating on this thing has got the cops here Oh
[289:16.69]This thing needs to be... Did I use all the... Oh, I have to wait.
[289:20.60]We having fun yet?
[289:21.60]That ought to make Javier happy.
[289:28.30]Let's see what this big bastard can do.
[289:33.51]Okay.
[289:33.91]What was that bump?
[289:39.94]You feel something?
[289:41.08]Am I spraying somebody's house with- is this shit?
[289:43.25]I think they mutton-obbed it.
[289:45.95]That house looks shitty anyway.
[289:51.49]This is disgusting.
[289:55.19]I wonder if they dented the truck.
[290:02.39]Hey, remind me to take a picture of the grill for insurance purposes.
[290:06.53]This is shocking.
[290:07.33]I hope we got coverage for that.
[290:13.80]Does it just stop after we get through?
[290:15.54]Okay, we have to... I wonder how much they're willing to pay for that property now.
[290:22.94]Okay, now we get a spray over here.
[290:25.48]There is a lesson to be learned here.
[290:27.74]Don't stand in the way of a septic truck.
[290:32.50]You love this.
[290:35.16]That guy, that person went nuts.
[290:36.60]Let's see you outsell my cousin now, asshole.
[290:45.47]I'll plow through anything that gets in my way.
[290:50.57]Power washing.
[290:52.25]I wish I could see the homeowner's face.
[290:58.58]Throw it in.
[291:00.94]Not that much more.
[291:01.92]There's no timer either.
[291:09.32]Wait, did I fail?
[291:11.35]What?
[291:13.81]Oh, come on.
[291:16.53]There is a timer.
[291:19.75]Oh, what the fuck?
[291:22.51]Why didn't I- I just- I just didn't understand what was going on.
[291:54.31]I wonder how much they're willing to pay for that property now.
[291:58.68]There's a route meter.
[291:59.48]You have to do it all before the route ends.
[292:01.94]Ah, okay.
[292:02.66]So that's the timer.
[292:03.30]I thought that was me increasing the amount of damage.
[292:05.56]I couldn't have avoided it if I wanted to.
[292:08.71]It's scraped!
[292:10.43]I think I'm way ahead.
[292:11.89]It couldn't break.
[292:12.91]It would have been unsafe.
[292:16.75]We don't got time for traffic laws.
[292:23.68]Get that house.
[292:24.18]The cars are almost worth doing more than the buildings.
[292:33.99]Reload it.
[292:37.65]What the fuck?
[292:51.00]Alright, I'll get there.
[292:51.76]Is that reaching?
[292:52.46]It's not.
[292:52.76]Oh, I can't reach across the street with this shit.
[292:55.08]Come on.
[293:13.02]Some people are just inconsiderate drivers, you know?
[293:15.06]Alright, I got it.
[293:16.75]There we go.
[293:18.63]Alright, so what were you saying?
[293:19.35]They were making a patch for this game?
[293:21.45]This, like, ten years later?
[293:23.13]That's crazy.
[293:26.39]There we go.
[293:27.03]Now I can do the mission.
[293:37.73]The developer making the patch recently died of cancer.
[293:40.69]Oh my god.
[293:41.55]That's terrible.
[293:42.99]That's awful.
[293:43.37]Well, this is really cool.
[293:44.47]This was, like, really, really fun.
[293:45.73]It's very saddening.
[293:46.75]Were they working on the patch, too?
[293:47.65]Like, officially?
[293:49.63]Oh, goddammit.
[294:14.49]Well, this is really, really cool.
[294:15.87]And the fact that somebody was, like, put this together... That's really sad, though.
[294:22.72]He was the sole reason why they started patching the game.
[294:29.84]Wow.
[294:43.12]It's still being worked on.
[294:52.93]Yeah, that is really sad because this is really cool.
[294:55.21]And it's just like... It makes me hear about kind of stuff like that.
[294:58.63]It just... I'm sitting here thinking like, oh, wow, what an awesome mod.
[295:03.07]Oh, this is so cool.
[295:04.33]Oh, that guy.
[295:04.79]And it's like, oh, that's... Why the fuck do we still have to have that shit in the world still?
[295:12.49]This is just so... It just angers me.
[295:16.83]That like this cancer still is a fucking thing.
[295:22.11]I really hope that whenever... Hundreds of years from now maybe.
[295:25.40]Maybe even less than that.
[295:28.76]This shit is just gone.
[295:29.50]And it's just very easy to get rid of.
[295:32.36]You hope that it's sooner than that.
[295:35.56]Much sooner.
[295:48.68]There's so much new shit that these medical companies are working on now that you gotta hope that some of this stuff actually plays out.
[296:02.88]I didn't do it.
[296:03.32]I did.
[296:18.05]Play the game?
[296:18.49]I will.
[296:22.19]I wanted the extra respect.
[296:23.45]Alright, let's do it.
[296:29.51]I can finally do that Ronin mission, right?
[296:31.53]Mm-hmm.
[296:32.30]Mm-hmm.
[296:47.01]I thought that was a spider.
[296:48.87]It's not.
[296:50.19]In fact, I have no idea what the hell this thing is.
[296:56.09]Pick up the stop sign?
[296:59.55]It said I could.
[297:00.55]Pick it up.
[297:00.93]I want to pick it up.
[297:03.66]Cool.
[297:08.86]I just want to test the range.
[297:23.02]Alright, well, I've launched him.
[297:28.40]Alright, where do I... Where am I going?
[297:31.06]That way.
[297:32.20]I need a car.
[297:43.53]Save.
[297:43.79]I got it.
[297:44.13]I saved it.
[297:47.43]This is very suspicious.
[297:48.27]Why is there an indicator over here?
[297:52.61]On this roof?
[298:09.88]When you wash in the shower, do you let the water run down your legs soapy or do you actually wash with your hands?
[298:16.82]I rub my hands all over my legs.
[298:23.57]Most of the soap is, so when I lather up, you get like a little bit of the squeeze, get it in your hands.
[298:30.14]Most of it goes on the crotch, right?
[298:32.16]You just like get it all over the crotch, all over like your balls and shit.
[298:35.48]And then like it really lathers up down there and then it goes everywhere else from there.
[298:39.39]That's the central point outward.
[298:49.94]If you're lathering and you're starting at chest or legs or back.
[298:54.08]No, no, no, no.
[298:54.88]That's the central location that can go up.
[298:56.78]There's an equal distance from like your crotch to everywhere else.
[299:02.16]Arrest that guy.
[299:04.01]Arrest him.
[299:25.05]Jesus.
[299:25.91]Alright, arrest him.
[299:34.28]Do they cuff people that aren't a playable character?
[299:36.76]Why is there another crew?
[299:38.94]Is there?
[299:39.12]Oh, there's another.
[299:40.22]I thought he shot at the other cop.
[299:41.22]Yeah.
[299:59.73]I can't get on the roof.
[300:02.17]Alright, get me out of here.
[300:12.64]I'm stuck in this area.
[300:14.02]Get me out of here.
[300:27.71]What the fuck?
[300:28.05]Your crosshair was right on him.
[300:29.25]Yeah, I know.
[300:29.83]It's a joke.
[300:35.25]What in God's name are you playing as?
[300:36.95]This is just the character in the game.
[300:38.24]You don't remember.
[300:38.92]You had like nostalgic glasses on.
[300:40.14]You don't remember this is what the character looks like.
[300:41.58]This is what the main character looks like.
[300:43.66]Alright, this is just like a battle going on out here.
[301:00.72]You suck.
[301:04.08]You are terrible.
[301:10.38]I need a car.
[301:11.20]Okay, I actually need a car.
[301:14.82]Please give me a car.
[301:17.65]This is getting ridiculous.
[301:23.43]Alright, now you pissed me off.
[301:29.51]Grrrr!
[301:58.10]Press R1 to drift.
[302:00.00]Again!
[302:02.37]What was that noise?
[302:03.15]That was my chair.
[302:06.13]I turned my chair a little bit and it has like a squeaky wheel.
[302:22.33]Don't you see?
[302:23.21]You don't take a turn if somebody's driving straight.
[302:41.93]Nothing was squeaky about that.
[302:43.67]I won't change the subject.
[302:50.25]I'll listen to it.
[302:54.95]Alright, now you pissed me off.
[303:06.59]I leaned back in the chair and it's the lumbar support goes back and it's really, really, it needs like WD-40.
[303:15.33]You guys are just over fucking reacting as usual, right?
[303:18.01]It's okay though.
[303:20.60]Twitch chat, right?
[303:37.55]He's a liar?
[303:43.38]Maybe
[303:57.84]One of my girls that technically legal called me up and said that a Ronin bachelor party was getting too touchy-feely.
[304:03.22]The bouncers have all been paid not to do dick.
[304:05.94]So if anyone is gonna teach those assholes a lesson, it's gonna have to be you.
[304:09.67]Okay.
[304:11.29]Oh, I'm here.
[304:11.77]I don't even have any weapons.
[304:18.09]I have pepper spray and some pistol ammo.
[304:23.24]Can I even do this?
[304:37.49]I don't think I even... Give me the ATM.
[304:43.09]Can I pick up the ATM?
[304:59.88]I only have... Oh, I have plenty of shots.
[305:03.80]Alright, who's bad in here?
[305:17.99]I assure you, I'm holding left.
[305:24.84]Oh, fuck.
[305:25.86]Watch out, watch out, watch out!
[305:30.49]Watch out!
[305:31.55]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[305:35.80]Watch out!
[305:36.92]What am I fucking firing at, dude?
[305:38.80]Why is it hitting the wall?
[305:40.04]You piece of shit.
[305:42.08]I can't believe you shot that person.
[305:43.20]Okay.
[306:21.20]What are you doing?
[306:24.99]You don't... Oh, well, it's... I guess he... That did not register that was happening when I first got in here.
[306:44.17]He paid.
[306:50.79]I paid for a lap dance, so I'm gonna get a lap dance.
[306:54.83]Hey!
[306:56.45]Didn't expect to see me here, did ya?
[306:58.15]Freeze!
[306:58.35]That's a TV.
[307:23.15]Freeze!
[307:24.03]Oh, no.
[307:27.05]You alright?
[307:29.25]Ooh.
[307:34.36]Freeze, scumbag!
[307:36.36]Oh, no.
[307:37.16]No, don't.
[307:37.64]Don't make me do this.
[307:38.46]Don't make me do this.
[307:39.04]That guy... That guy was a super-powered person.
[307:48.83]Hands in the air, scumbag!
[308:00.16]Get over here.
[308:01.16]Get over here.
[308:02.20]Why can't I not grab you?
[308:16.73]You alright?
[308:24.45]Oh, this is not good.
[308:36.04]I'm so sorry, but I have to do this.
[308:42.05]I'm sorry.
[308:42.59]I'm so sorry.
[308:44.77]I'm so sorry.
[308:45.39]I don't really... I don't want... I can't even pick this person up.
[308:53.18]Oh, my God.
[308:54.26]No.
[308:54.80]God damn it.
[308:55.62]I was trying to throw you out here.
[309:00.67]You've ruined everything.
[309:01.93]The game got stuck.
[309:18.74]You didn't think I was gonna be fucking this small, did you?
[309:22.86]You didn't think I was this small.
[309:24.52]Look at that.
[309:42.34]Dude, really?
[309:43.72]Honest to God, I... Hold on.
[309:45.72]This is very important.
[309:52.30]I'm trying to shoot him in the finger.
[309:59.98]Just, like, in the finger.
[310:01.06]I just need... No, it doesn't... They can't even be interacted with.
[310:13.12]Oh no, I'm supposed to go to the roof.
[310:22.97]Stay where you are.
[310:23.83]All NPCs don't move.
[310:31.78]Room back to A. Wait, did I go in here yet?
[310:53.32]Okay.
[310:53.92]Upstairs.
[310:54.44]I gotta get to the roof.
[311:01.31]Alright.
[311:01.73]Take him up from up here.
[311:02.47]Ooh, a CD.
[311:07.35]How am I supposed to do this?
[311:09.17]CDs.
[311:09.41]Just shoot them from... I have a pistol.
[311:13.71]Is there a weapon up here I can get?
[311:28.01]Fucking God, that hurts.
[311:29.65]Ouch.
[311:32.29]That person's... First try to talk to me?
[311:46.05]That was weird.
[311:56.40]Oh, you have a hostage.
[311:57.32]I'm really glad I actually didn't shoot you.
[312:02.60]I can't hit them.
[312:05.05]They cannot be injured.
[312:06.51]Look at this.
[312:08.41]Oh, no.
[312:09.07]Never mind.
[312:26.18]Does this count if I don't kill them?
[312:31.80]I can fall off this.
[312:32.54]I gotta be careful.
[312:37.48]Where is this part?
[312:38.28]Over there.
[312:38.58]Okay, I see.
[312:40.02]Oh, no.
[312:41.40]I'm on roller skates.
[312:43.74]This is not the place to be on roller skates.
[312:51.77]I'm okay.
[313:07.11]Easy.
[313:15.51]Don't fall off.
[313:18.37]Oh my goodness.
[313:19.17]This person is so good.
[313:21.92]All jokes are writing themselves.
[313:23.28]I have not fallen off yet.
[313:32.36]I can't even see this person.
[313:46.99]Is the tree shooting at me?
[313:48.27]I don't... Where are they?
[313:49.01]That's it, right?
[313:57.90]Okay, I got it.
[313:58.32]Oh, don't do that.
[314:04.28]Thousand bucks.
[314:15.53]500 bucks a day.
[314:24.89]That's saved, right?
[314:25.77]That counts?
[314:26.31]Does that count?
[314:28.32]I got the screen, right?
[314:32.72]Okay.
[314:33.84]Good.
[314:34.28]Thank God.
[314:43.44]Game did not crash.
[314:44.34]I'm fine.
[314:49.56]Need a little bit more respect.
[314:50.42]Let's do another race.
[314:57.00]Try to get the gold medal here.
[315:06.16]It's hard to even see.
[315:17.05]I can try to screw with them.
[315:19.43]I like to smash it on the brakes.
[315:30.81]I was trying to get somebody to fly out the windshield.
[315:33.70]What a dummy.
[315:35.20]You're out.
[315:41.18]The person's attached to their car.
[315:50.51]I hit the rock.
[315:51.39]I'm the one person that hits the rock.
[316:13.50]Get out of here.
[316:18.20]Excuse me.
[316:18.50]I had to kill the person back there.
[316:31.03]I should have just killed that person and got on the road.
[316:44.70]Alright, that's a gold medal.
[316:52.71]Nice.
[316:52.91]How much is that?
[316:53.37]A couple thousand dollars?
[317:02.35]This person's right here.
[317:03.23]Who is this?
[317:03.63]Are they in this building in front of me?
[317:08.66]Oh, they're in the hospital.
[317:10.38]Right.
[317:20.93]Is that person right there?
[317:22.09]It's this guy right here.
[317:41.82]I gotta get him alone, right?
[317:56.82]Shock paddles?
[317:57.44]I don't have shock paddles anymore.
[317:58.58]Did I get the plant?
[318:14.90]Take him out.
[318:15.40]Take him out.
[318:15.80]Did I get him?
[318:39.48]Is he- alright, I've had enough.
[318:41.56]You're spraying your own- you fucking moron.
[318:51.22]Take a gun out.
[318:54.93]You fucking idiot, like really?
[318:59.41]No, don't you-
[319:10.50]Everybody stay calm.
[319:12.08]That was a really bad guy.
[319:13.40]I'm an undercover agent.
[319:18.66]I'm an undercover police agent.
[319:20.10]FBI officer.
[319:21.61]This guy was very bad.
[319:22.93]He was... I don't even know what he was doing.
[319:24.31]He was doing something.
[319:25.17]Somebody paid me a lot of money to do that.
[319:26.89]Have a nice day.
[319:44.14]save it again what alright now should I do what's this oh this is for sale no no no no no no I want to spend some money I want to get some new cool clothes we're gonna get some really like snappy nice suits and stuff and maybe some weapons yeah
[320:12.54]Brass knuckle.
[320:13.02]What's a good weapon shop?
[320:19.18]Go to the casino.
[320:21.22]No, I'm not doing that.
[320:23.78]Go to the mall?
[320:29.73]The good clothes shop is near the bridge.
[320:32.57]Is someone down here?
[320:35.45]I'll try it.
[320:35.77]Okay.
[320:45.94]The casino will sell you a suit.
[321:00.01]I don't think they have your size.
[321:09.68]Hostage diversion?
[321:13.17]You drive at high speeds to evade the cops until your hostage breaks down and pays you.
[321:20.26]What?
[321:23.04]There's so much shit to do in this game.
[321:24.98]I have two hostages?
[321:29.12]Drive really fast for a minute. ...
[321:43.42]Where's this?
[321:47.46]I don't understand where.
[321:59.76]I want to go to the clothing store.
[322:03.27]I don't care about that mission right now.
[322:04.71]Oh, it's because it's in the back.
[322:16.93]I think they got away.
[322:18.24]Okay.
[322:23.28]I want to buy some nice clothes.
[322:33.73]No, I don't... I want... Eyes?
[322:37.23]Human eyes.
[322:46.63]okay well I mean I have to do that that's so stupid how about a knitted cap
[323:17.13]This is not... Like, suits?
[323:23.65]These are different couch fabrics.
[323:25.61]Where'd you guys bring me to?
[323:34.31]Go to the suits category?
[323:36.38]Oh, outfits.
[323:39.52]The game fucking crashed.
[323:40.88]Of course it did.
[323:54.34]He fell for it?
[323:56.56]Oh, well.
[323:56.84]I don't know what I just did.
[324:03.66]Hopefully it's the right one.
[324:11.55]334.
[324:12.03]It's this one.
[324:17.95]Outfits always crash the game.
[324:20.59]Suit category outright crashes your game every time when previewed.
[324:23.54]Oh, well, that's good to know.
[324:28.56]I can do the mission.
[324:30.26]Why is there a big pile of money on the coffee table?
[324:32.34]It's a little complicated.
[324:33.45]We shot up a Ronin casino and stole the cash.
[324:35.67]And you brought that shit here?
[324:36.95]For a second, I didn't even know what that was on the couch.
[324:38.79]I didn't even know it was me.
[324:39.53]But the Ronin know you stole it, right?
[324:40.75]I was trying to figure out what it was the first two seconds.
[324:42.65]Yeah, well, if we went with your plan, we'd still be talking about it.
[324:46.03]Fuck off, Gat.
[324:46.98]Excuse me?
[324:47.70]Shut up.
[324:48.24]We're on.
[324:49.43]You're one of those deflated people from the anti-smoking ads?
[325:14.27]doesn't he have an English accent too isn't he like oh Roy I'm gonna get under you I'm gonna get under your toenails
[325:42.35]Doesn't it have a British accent?
[325:43.55]Buy an expensive car.
[326:16.26]Holy shit!
[326:17.34]That- I- I- Whatever.
[326:18.58]Whoa, that's cool!
[326:52.78]How much is it?
[326:53.34]Except I only have $13,900 as a net worth total.
[326:55.80]So hopefully it's under that.
[326:57.62]Did I buy it?
[327:21.72]We're going a different route.
[327:22.34]See?
[327:22.42]They're coming down that road right now.
[327:23.62]Look at that.
[327:24.10]500 IQ play.
[327:25.22]Good stuff.
[327:55.48]Don't bait me with that bullshit.
[328:06.30]Don't- I'm not going that way.
[328:18.55]Told you it was gonna work.
[328:25.77]Eventually.
[328:34.46]Hello, I brought you a car.
[328:36.14]Are the wheels still spinning?
[329:00.11]Oh, no.
[329:04.71]You idiot.
[329:06.01]You absolute idiot.
[329:07.61]And I'm talking about both people on the screen right now.
[329:10.33]Because what that did, unfortunately, is it wedged it into the car.
[329:15.58]I would have been able to go, but the bike is now here.
[329:18.40]And that is a huge problem.
[329:22.80]This is very bad.
[329:29.88]Hello?
[329:31.38]Settle down.
[329:31.74]Alright, I gotta knock that... Wait.
[329:35.36]Another one crashed!
[329:36.38]What are they doing?
[329:37.16]I... Okay.
[329:42.06]You guys gotta settle the fuck down.
[329:49.70]Alright, I got back in the car.
[329:52.16]Good, let's go.
[329:54.75]Come on, dude.
[329:56.61]Why?
[329:58.21]Why did you have to do this?
[330:06.68]Get the fuck away from me dude.
[330:20.35]This is stuck now.
[330:27.94]I think I just made it worse somehow.
[330:29.56]How did I make this worse?
[330:36.75]I'm like a different character that just came around what?
[330:40.95]This game's gonna crash I know it they're gonna keep piling in here
[331:06.42]I can't even get up.
[331:13.13]Eventually, they'll do that enough times where I'll be able to get out of here, I think.
[331:18.82]Can I use all their bodies and all their crushed rubble to drive over it?
[331:32.71]Oh no, I wonder what's going to happen.
[331:35.23]I hear a motorcycle.
[331:37.39]I wonder if the motorcycle is coming this way.
[331:42.36]Oh, there's a cop.
[331:42.88]Oh dear.
[331:46.30]Oh dear.
[332:02.06]how could it possibly still not be able to move this is not possible I don't actually it's impossible give me a car give me another car
[332:28.58]Will you just leave already?
[332:30.02]Just get up.
[332:31.30]Can I please?
[332:33.64]Just get up and leave.
[332:34.40]There's no reason for you to be here.
[332:35.44]Just get out of here.
[332:36.42]Go this way.
[332:37.20]Just go that way.
[332:39.92]I didn't even do anything.
[332:40.94]He's legal.
[332:42.48]Oh, my God.
[332:43.14]I did.
[332:44.28]Did I?
[332:44.76]Yes.
[332:46.24]Oh, what the fuck?
[332:48.22]What?
[333:08.51]There's so many motorcycles under here.
[333:10.87]It's gonna be impossible to get us to move.
[333:20.39]Idiots.
[333:30.70]This is not accomplishing anything.
[333:32.82]I'm just going to be... It's going to get this stuck.
[333:35.01]I need to take the L?
[333:35.79]Yeah, I think I do.
[333:50.16]Did somebody else crash?
[333:52.44]Where did you come from?
[334:06.16]I don't know what else to do.
[334:08.26]Hold L2.
[334:08.74]Let's throw a grenade.
[334:19.65]Nothing is going to work.
[334:23.20]Alright, stop that.
[334:28.02]I have to restart the mission.
[334:35.61]Maybe it'll despawn.
[334:42.01]Get out of the car.
[335:01.89]I think the wheels are touching something.
[335:03.59]The wheels are touching something.
[335:10.30]Fuck this mission.
[335:21.17]I'll just redo it.
[335:30.92]What?
[335:39.64]Okay, retry from... I don't know what that is, so I'm going to press backspace.
[335:44.14]Is it enter?
[335:44.72]That's enter, right?
[335:46.98]Thank God.
[335:47.82]Let's go.
[335:48.28]I thought that was a ramp.
[336:49.49]Word is, you're the guy to talk to about military grade weapons.
[336:53.80]Thank you.
[336:56.32]The special AR-50 fires grenades using right click.
[337:05.61]Very cool.
[337:06.79]That's really cool.
[337:07.51]What is right click again?
[337:12.02]It's left trigger.
[337:18.52]It doesn't fail the mission, right?
[337:33.00]Don't even think about going to that same spot.
[337:36.04]Thank God.
[337:57.07]Hey!
[337:58.23]Alright, I got some for you.
[337:59.07]I'm looking to unload some merch.
[338:00.47]Can you help?
[338:01.77]Protect the- I just blew the car up.
[338:03.95]I don't know why I did that.
[338:05.00]I don't understand.
[338:29.36]What happened?
[338:30.14]I'm so childish.
[338:32.90]I just am fucking, I'm childish.
[338:34.66]I'm a child and I have to agree.
[338:44.83]Jesus, you're a worse driver than I am.
[338:50.54]Look where my legs are, my knees are so high.
[338:59.45]There's not much to protect us from.
[339:05.93]What am I protecting us from?
[339:19.62]One person?
[339:20.24]Oh, go that way.
[339:32.62]Okay, I tried to shoot the car in front of us.
[339:40.38]We're traveling fast so it's gonna go back and hit us.
[339:44.49]We drove into it.
[339:47.27]There's nothing to even fire at so I'm just getting bored.
[339:52.87]There's nobody after us.
[339:56.32]I don't even know what they're talking about.
[340:04.12]My god What were they all stacked in one spot did they all spawn there holy shit oh My goodness, I don't think it's supposed to be like this Jesus Christ
[340:34.34]Do you think that has something to do with the fact that they all were stuck in that little ravine?
[340:40.71]And then it spawned them all in the same place?
[340:44.83]If you crash anymore, this is going to start to... It's not going to be my fault if you do that.
[340:49.91]You crash again, this is on fire.
[340:52.57]No, it's going to... Please be careful.
[340:54.86]We're very close.
[340:59.88]Okay, thank God.
[341:05.67]What's going on?
[341:06.88]Shogo is explaining her failure to his father.
[341:09.90]Mr. Akuchi doesn't sound happy.
[341:12.60]That's because his son has brought him much shame.
[341:15.86]Akuchi-san is coming to America to teach Shogo how to laugh.
[341:18.32]Remember, my mom has a dog with a sister?
[341:20.34]Shout out the dog?
[341:22.00]Shout out to your sister's dog.
[341:23.26]I think I misinterpreted that.
[341:25.64]What would you have me do?
[341:37.83]Somebody has an important question.
[341:50.01]How do I explain the word sus?
[341:51.53]I don't know.
[341:54.15]That's not my thing.
[341:59.88]Ooh.
[342:13.00]Okay, cool.
[342:15.36]15 grand.
[342:16.12]Weapon time.
[342:23.01]How have I not tried to do this yet?
[342:26.94]This is incredibly surprising that I haven't done this.
[342:41.12]It works.
[342:50.20]Holy shit.
[342:50.74]Okay, that's really... Oh, I need to go get guns, right?
[343:08.41]I don't want heat going in here.
[343:15.90]What the hell?
[343:16.54]Oh, I thought I just shot electricity out of the gun.
[343:23.16]What?
[343:25.38]You're good, alright.
[343:30.54]Why are people like dead in here?
[343:39.95]Okay, you can purchase melee weapons.
[343:43.17]Ooh, wait a minute.
[343:45.09]Oh, no.
[343:46.57]Holy shit.
[343:47.21]Okay, I definitely want this.
[343:52.17]I want the sledgehammer.
[343:55.58]I want the baseball bat.
[343:59.08]Okay, cool.
[344:07.16]How do I, um...
[344:14.42]How do I switch between them?
[344:19.59]You can only have one melee weapon at a time.
[344:25.51]Can I trade this in?
[344:38.53]What a bad time to do that.
[344:49.24]What are you looking at?
[344:57.83]Eat, eat, eat.
[344:58.23]Quick, quick, quick.
[345:08.22]Oh, a titan.
[345:19.39]Right through.
[345:20.01]Perfect fit.
[345:22.53]There's no way you got through that too.
[345:32.72]Three stars.
[345:33.78]Uh, sorry.
[345:34.16]I got three stars.
[345:35.08]I'll, um...
[345:48.70]Nobody is unloading the whole clip.
[345:52.64]Are they still shooting?
[345:59.19]Who's still firing?
[346:04.31]I can't tell who's shooting.
[346:09.09]Who's still firing?
[346:26.82]Can I get in the bed?
[346:33.10]Leave me alone.
[346:33.54]I thought that was going to hurt me.
[346:42.76]I need to get some more respect.
[346:43.70]I need... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[346:45.14]Hold on a minute.
[346:47.18]I need to... That's a store.
[346:48.60]Okay.
[346:51.54]This place is called Friendly Fire.
[346:53.18]I want to go there.
[347:03.29]Nice iPad.
[347:09.49]I like iPads.
[347:29.45]Really guys?
[347:31.81]All at once now, right?
[347:39.79]You gotta go with the skid.
[347:53.12]Are you actually arresting me?
[347:54.98]Oh fine, I don't care.
[348:17.28]Oh, we're the Andes.
[348:18.37]I want to do the surf thing.
[348:25.31]Can I not do the surf thing here?
[348:31.53]Get up there!
[348:44.08]It looks like I'm stuck in the windshield.
[348:56.55]Okay.
[348:57.45]Enough playing around.
[348:58.71]Next person that runs me over... You're... Freeze.
[349:10.29]I mean, I have to do something with this.
[349:13.01]Right?
[349:13.53]Can I buy a hot dog?
[349:28.91]I'm just trying... I didn't kill him.
[349:31.26]He's fine.
[349:31.70]Okay.
[349:39.71]Alright, we gotta get the hot dog to fight somebody.
[349:41.23]Follow me.
[349:44.57]Don't run.
[349:50.33]Don't run.
[349:56.21]You just wanted to fight me.
[349:57.07]This is bullshit.
[349:57.73]I wanted you to... You can be the hot dog if you want.
[350:04.53]Am I actually in trouble again?
[350:07.51]No.
[350:19.42]Alright, get me over there.
[350:20.04]I need some weapons.
[350:21.20]Remember, you're a big bully.
[350:29.61]Only in GTA games.
[350:32.65]I swear, I'm a very sweet, sweet boy.
[350:35.59]Outside of Grand Theft Auto third-person games, I promise.
[350:38.11]I'm a nice young man outside of this.
[350:54.30]I didn't even see those people.
[351:09.09]This is far away, geez.
[351:25.76]You get respect for bailing out of the car.
[351:27.24]Okay.
[351:32.58]I... Can I take the safe?
[351:40.77]Ooh, alright.
[351:52.15]Pistols, SMGs, shotguns, rifles, special, thrown.
[351:56.67]Alright, I want this thing.
[352:00.81]This is a 12 gauge.
[352:02.21]I'm buying it.
[352:06.04]Okay.
[352:10.98]You have this weapon.
[352:11.58]Shotgun ammo.
[352:20.79]Okay, I already have this.
[352:24.36]Holy shit.
[352:24.94]Hell yeah, Magnum.
[352:25.70]I want it bad.
[352:30.56]I'm wasting so much money.
[352:34.10]Check the special weapon cache?
[352:37.07]What does that mean?
[352:53.21]Alright, I don't want to spend all my money.
[352:57.89]Wait.
[352:59.09]Weapon cash, space bar.
[353:01.97]We do weapons cash.
[353:03.97]Oh, I see what you mean.
[353:07.23]Okay.
[353:07.47]Jewel, 44 shepherds.
[353:09.94]Are you kidding me?
[353:11.70]Wow.
[353:13.44]Okay.
[353:16.82]Double 12 gauge?
[353:26.53]I want the sledgehammer.
[353:31.37]This is insane.
[353:33.51]Alright.
[353:37.86]I definitely want to put this on.
[353:38.70]Alright, cool.
[353:41.52]Let's go.
[353:46.52]That's what I'm talking about.
[353:50.81]Oh, that's sick.
[353:53.19]Alright.
[353:53.57]Now give me all the money in the register.
[354:01.47]Get to the safe.
[354:09.09]Thank you.
[354:09.91]Wait, this is not the thing.
[354:11.49]I didn't want to fucking kill that lady.
[354:13.05]Honest to goddamn god, I didn't want to do that.
[354:16.91]I actually didn't want to throw it at her and kill her.
[354:18.77]And now, I don't know what I'm doing.
[354:21.78]I'm gonna test this on you.
[354:23.52]It works.
[354:30.87]Why did I do that?
[354:33.24]Pick up the safe.
[354:34.96]No, and then I threw- I just wanted to get rid of it.
[354:39.04]What a dumbass.
[354:39.84]These things are powerful, holy shit.
[354:55.85]Three, two, one.
[355:00.43]Why is it telling me to go this way?
[355:01.49]What the hell?
[355:28.68]There's only 30 seconds here.
[355:29.74]This is going to be tricky.
[355:33.54]Alright, the first thing that somebody says is what I'm going to eat tonight.
[355:35.78]What is it?
[355:43.85]I didn't even look at the chat.
[355:46.47]I have no idea what you wrote.
[355:51.31]Dude, this one is really hard.
[355:52.43]I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do this one.
[355:58.48]Yeah, I can't do this one.
[356:01.76]Holy shit, I got 25 more seconds.
[356:03.20]I'm an idiot.
[356:21.40]Alright, I saw a taco.
[356:23.04]Sounds pretty good.
[356:25.46]Don't follow the GPS, you donkey.
[356:29.45]No, stop it.
[356:30.37]What are you doing?
[356:31.85]No, not by Wellington.
[356:35.11]Three, two, one.
[356:44.28]Go!
[356:45.92]I got it.
[356:47.60]I'm not going to make it.
[356:58.44]I wasn't getting seconds added.
[357:00.28]That was horseshit.
[357:07.94]Stuffed crust pizza?
[357:17.66]I'm just testing to see if it works.
[357:25.31]I have not had Popeye's yet.
[357:26.33]That's a good idea.
[357:32.18]Alright, let's do a mission.
[357:34.20]What time is it?
[357:36.82]Oh shit, it's been a long time.
[357:38.66]I'm having a good time.
[357:39.44]This is really fun.
[357:39.94]Alright, I'm going to go to the casino.
[357:51.73]This is a pretty long drive from here.
[357:54.35]We'll play this again.
[357:57.25]I'll probably be live at some point in the middle of the week.
[357:59.59]Like Wednesday or Thursday.
[358:01.25]Keep an eye on the sus.
[358:02.47]End of the stream voice?
[358:03.32]Almost.
[358:03.72]Not quite.
[358:14.44]How do you feel about the asbestos allegations?
[358:19.79]That I've been like eating it?
[358:20.83]What are you talking about?
[358:31.48]Oh, here we go.
[358:41.62]The rain makes the game lag so much.
[358:46.99]There were people waiting for me down that alleyway.
[358:55.43]Oh.
[359:08.68]Don't let her get out.
[359:11.08]Did I get it?
[359:14.33]I got it.
[359:15.91]Okay.
[359:20.27]She just exploded, I think.
[359:23.79]Oh, man.
[359:24.41]I didn't do it.
[359:24.91]Okay.
[359:33.44]I want to try this.
[359:34.20]I want to get this right.
[359:43.70]I wanna see how you do this.
[359:53.34]Alright, fall out to the safe.
[360:00.88]Go to the safe!
[360:01.74]What's going on?
[360:03.23]Keep your cursor on.
[360:04.41]It's red.
[360:07.15]Will you go to the safe?
[360:14.55]Hurry.
[360:15.05]There are raccoons in the trash outside.
[360:17.08]They're gonna get me.
[360:18.98]Go to the safe.
[360:22.22]That's right.
[360:22.54]Open it up.
[360:26.78]You alright?
[360:27.44]Okay.
[360:27.80]Thank you.
[360:30.64]Is there money in there?
[360:31.22]Oh, there's a cheeseburger.
[360:33.31]Alright.
[360:36.79]Oh, nope.
[360:48.48]Do I know you?
[360:48.96]Hope so.
[361:23.04]You're a psycho.
[361:24.40]This Saints Row 2.
[361:25.22]We're not playing Putt-Putt's Great Adventure.
[361:30.84]I'm not playing like a math game.
[361:39.02]I thought I was gonna fall through the middle.
[361:44.54]Oh my god.
[361:45.24]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[361:50.08]I gotta get the camera.
[361:51.06]Is there a camera?
[361:54.07]I swear to god there's a camera in this game, isn't there?
[361:55.89]Is there a camera?
[361:58.31]Is there a camera?
[362:13.28]Did I get in?
[362:30.18]Um, sure.
[362:31.38]I guess that is fine that it happened like that.
[362:35.14]Who drove the car?
[362:55.81]Adrift.
[363:03.21]Oh, MonkaW.
[363:05.19]I can do that one better, I think.
[363:06.75]There's a better way to say that.
[363:08.15]Instead of, like, MonkaW.
[363:09.19]I get kind of caught up a little bit.
[363:11.53]It should be, like, MonkaW.
[363:13.97]No.
[363:14.51]It's going to be harder, right?
[363:15.79]Because MonkaW is much closer and much more, like, holy shit.
[363:23.51]It'll be way more force behind it.
[363:24.87]I don't know why I thought I could climb that.
[363:43.49]Alright, where's the casino?
[363:55.78]Come in!
[364:02.10]Oh, that's not the entrance.
[364:04.80]Wrong one.
[364:11.64]Is it this side?
[364:13.79]Yeah, save the game for sure.
[364:19.65]That sounds, yeah, Munga W sounds too forced.
[364:21.81]You're right.
[364:22.49]No, I completely agree.
[364:27.77]Where's this building?
[364:31.67]Where is it?
[364:32.03]Isn't it this one?
[364:42.21]There it is.
[365:09.08]Oh, here's every single mukbang video you've ever watched in your entire life.
[365:20.11]I
[365:47.36]That's a lot.
[365:48.42]That's a lot of what the fuck, dude.
[365:53.38]Excellent.
[365:55.10]Alright.
[365:55.58]Here's the fucking $9,000.
[365:56.30]Ten.
[365:56.46]Twenty.
[365:56.74]Oh, yo, yo.
[366:17.63]Something's wrong with me.
[366:18.49]I swear to God.
[366:18.97]13.
[366:34.27]Hit it.
[366:35.75]Stay.
[366:38.17]Alright.
[366:38.55]Shut up.
[366:39.85]I've had enough of that behavior.
[366:44.21]It's like, just stop it.
[366:46.77]There's no reason to be doing that.
[366:48.53]Like, why?
[366:49.43]This is so bad.
[366:55.91]Okay.
[367:06.87]Let me get this right here.
[367:07.69]18.
[367:07.71]Oh, it means you're going to have 20.
[367:10.47]You fucking idiot.
[367:24.23]How did I know?
[367:24.77]Anytime you play Blackjack, you always assume the dealer has a 10 underneath.
[367:29.59]So you just assume that that is a 10 that's not shown.
[367:34.05]What a dogshit hit.
[367:35.11]I have zero dollars now.
[367:37.25]I lose.
[367:37.53]The game crashed.
[367:53.58]That's probably a good place to stop I think.
[367:55.58]Right at the exact pretty much six hour mark.
[368:01.44]That was really fun though.
[368:03.14]We'll do that again.
[368:05.10]Maybe we'll do that again at some point in the middle of the week.
[368:11.91]Still trying to keep the twice a week thing going.
[368:15.41]You can always pretty much assume there'll be something on the weekend and then something somewhere in the middle of the week.
[368:19.67]Somewhere like Wednesday, Thursday and like maybe Sunday.
[368:23.77]I was thinking about maybe doing Saturday, Sunday, but I don't want that much time to pass.
[368:28.33]Because back three or four months ago, I was doing Saturday to Saturday, essentially.
[368:34.55]So... I want to really try to get on that one stream every four or five days.
[368:46.62]Rather than one stream every seven or eight days.
[368:51.62]We're going to play Saints Row 2 again.
[368:54.62]Because I'm very invested.
[368:56.36]That was a lot of fun.
[368:57.58]Hope you enjoyed yourselves.
[369:01.98]Thanks for watching.
[369:02.50]Here are all the subs today.
[369:05.30]Thanks, everybody.
[369:07.34]I no longer call out that many subs anymore.
[369:11.36]But I still really appreciate it.
[369:19.68]Yeah, we'll see what's going on in the middle of the week.
[369:21.76]I mean, they're going to play this again.
[369:22.98]Or maybe we'll do some co-op stuff.
[369:28.60]We'll see.
[369:29.28]I live life by the wings or something.
[369:32.30]Whatever it is.
[369:32.72]I just wing it.
[369:38.14]We'll see you again.
[369:39.02]Keep an eye on the sauce over the next few days.
[369:45.17]We are going to... Let's raid Ludwig.
[369:48.47]I want you to tell Ludwig that we listened to the Christmas album and I thought it was phenomenal.
[369:59.39]I want you to make sure you tell Ludwig.
[370:03.77]That it was really good.
[370:04.73]And don't, yeah, don't be stupid.
[370:10.29]It actually was really good.
[370:15.50]Like, I'm jealous at the musical talent, I really am.
[370:18.92]I didn't even know he could sing.
[370:20.92]Like, that's Cutie, right, as well?
[370:23.10]He can sing.
[370:23.72]He can sing.
[370:31.12]Are you guys still grounded?
[370:32.41]Yeah, you are because I saw that first part when I raided Vinny.
[370:35.49]And you still did it.
[370:36.25]You're grounded.
[370:38.59]All of you.
[370:38.99]Every single person collectively.
[370:44.87]Alright.
[370:45.16]I'll see you guys later.
[370:46.58]Thanks for watching as always.
[370:49.04]Go say the Christmas album is fire.
[370:53.26]And I will see you guys in probably a few days.
[370:56.36]Keep an eye on the sus.
[370:58.16]Take care of yourselves.
[371:00.01]Have a great night.
[371:15.96]Get this to 8k.
[371:21.44]I want an 8k red.
[371:47.69]Influencer Andy.
[371:50.79]You've got 10 seconds to do it.
[371:53.43]At least 7,500.
[371:53.77]Come on.
[371:54.47]Come on.
[372:00.80]I know you guys can do it.
[372:01.90]Come on.
[372:02.20]I know you can.
[372:03.92]There's still so many of you that haven't done it.
[372:16.62]I did my part.
[372:17.40]Yeah, thank you.
[372:17.98]Remember, you look kind of like Ernest.
[372:21.28]I forgot I was in this until this very moment.
