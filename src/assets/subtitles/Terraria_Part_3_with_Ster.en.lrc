[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.91]Hey, what's happening?
[00:06.69]We are all set up Sometimes Terraria just takes a while to get it right, but we're good Welcome everybody Currently in the game, but not Let's see if we can see if he's ready.
[00:27.31]Is he ready?
[00:37.32]Nobody heard you do that.
[00:38.66]Quick, do that funny thing you just did again because nobody heard you do it.
[00:42.10]Has anyone ever heard me do this before?
[00:44.01]Ever?
[00:44.27]Hello?
[00:44.95]Hello?
[00:46.49]What did you call me?
[00:47.21]I was kind of glad that I didn't have it muted.
[00:49.89]You know what I mean?
[00:50.69]I had you muted, so I was kind of happy about that.
[00:53.99]Honestly, I think what you should do is just mute me now.
[00:59.60]Mute you now?
[01:00.20]Okay.
[01:00.46]You're muted?
[01:01.22]You're muted?
[01:05.93]What?
[01:07.83]I don't understand.
[01:10.25]What's this joke?
[01:11.67]I thought you were going to do a funny thing when I muted you.
[01:14.27]I thought you were going to come through the game audio.
[01:18.86]The joke is that you'll finally get a week off where you don't have to talk to me.
[01:24.88]I thought the joke was Terraria has in-game VoIP and I'm going to talk to you in there now.
[01:30.40]That would be pretty funny.
[01:31.79]But it doesn't.
[01:34.00]Alright, so if you weren't here last time we played this, you probably noticed something.
[01:40.65]Or the time before that.
[01:41.73]Or the time before that.
[01:43.63]Or any of those times.
[01:46.53]Everybody in here is dead.
[01:48.33]He did this thing, he did this fucked up thing at the end of the stream where he accidentally summoned like a clam.
[01:53.45]I mean, it was a hilarious final episode to last week's season.
[01:58.17]So if I'm you, I watch that and I catch up.
[02:02.42]We're on episode 74 right now, I think.
[02:05.01]Mm-hmm.
[02:05.99]Of the Terraria Let's Play.
[02:08.15]The thing is, people will start appearing, like this guy appeared on the roof.
[02:10.97]Sometimes they might appear on the lava and just die again, though.
[02:14.25]Oh, really?
[02:14.67]That's a possibility.
[02:17.09]Should we fill that space or something?
[02:18.89]No.
[02:19.35]See, because all the bunny rabbits are walking into it.
[02:22.48]They really are.
[02:23.08]It's a bunny rabbit death machine.
[02:25.58]And that's important to have.
[02:26.68]But there's nothing we can do about this.
[02:29.42]No.
[02:29.58]No.
[02:31.06]We can't just put a platform here and they won't walk into it?
[02:34.01]No.
[02:34.61]Don't do it.
[02:37.49]Because when it's nighttime and there's enemies out here and they're walking the lava, you're going to be happy then.
[02:42.21]No, don't do it, squirrel.
[02:43.47]Cute squirrels.
[02:45.07]Don't do it.
[02:47.73]Don't.
[02:49.89]Don't do it, please.
[02:50.91]He's going to do it.
[02:54.98]I'm trying to scare him away.
[02:57.18]See?
[02:58.02]He's like, I'm Shmite, I'm a squirrel.
[03:00.88]You saved a life.
[03:05.91]Okay.
[03:07.39]So what was the last thing we did?
[03:08.63]The last... We've killed one mechanical boss, which are the first bosses after normal mode.
[03:18.83]Okay.
[03:19.23]Yeah, I remember the mechanical skeleton guy.
[03:22.73]We have to get some of the new ore that's in the world.
[03:27.05]There's a lot of things to do.
[03:28.17]Okay.
[03:33.39]You can gather ore if you want.
[03:35.11]What do you want to do?
[03:35.92]What's your fantasy right now?
[03:37.36]I like to fight the bosses.
[03:38.36]That's the most fun.
[03:40.02]Okay.
[03:42.70]I have to look up how we craft a new mechanical boss.
[03:47.06]Light of the Ebon Hammer.
[03:48.16]Is this bad?
[03:50.58]It looks pretty bad.
[03:53.15]There was a copper axe that I finally, I just saw in the storage.
[03:56.17]There's a lot of dumpsters laying around.
[03:59.96]Is there anybody we can even sell to?
[04:03.94]Uh, the girl on the right.
[04:06.84]Why are they, how come they're not in their houses?
[04:13.29]Um, because when they appear, they show up, they like walk here.
[04:16.99]You know, it's all cinematic.
[04:18.59]But because our houses are prisons, they can't walk into their room.
[04:22.01]So if we... Actually, I don't know how multiplayer does it, but usually if you leave the area and come back later, they'll just be in their house.
[04:27.94]Huh, okay.
[04:29.64]Alright, well, you want to go collect some ore?
[04:31.34]Collect some ore?
[04:33.76]Yeah.
[04:37.91]Uh, sure.
[04:38.37]Because we absolutely need a Mithra Anvil.
[04:40.79]Or a... Mithra Anvil?
[04:43.97]Mithral.
[04:47.66]Okay, let's go down our tube.
[04:49.72]Down the tube.
[04:51.59]I need to get you a pickaxe that works.
[04:54.13]I still have that shitty one from earlier.
[04:56.30]Yeah.
[04:56.68]You can't mine these ores.
[05:00.60]So... Should I even come down with you?
[05:05.42]Um... Yeah, it'll be... If I can't mine anything, I might as well just tell a funny story to my chat.
[05:13.16]Oh yeah, tell a funny story to your chat while I play Terraria for you.
[05:17.23]Wait, wait, wait.
[05:18.19]Party up.
[05:19.88]Red team.
[05:21.16]Red team.
[05:22.08]Red team.
[05:22.48]Party up.
[05:27.97]Ooh!
[05:28.75]What's this thing?
[05:30.31]How do you do that?
[05:31.73]You right-click on it.
[05:32.79]Oh, cool.
[05:39.51]How do I get out?
[05:40.20]I don't know how to get out.
[05:42.92]Is it R or E?
[05:45.02]E, R. Okay.
[05:46.70]You're dying.
[05:47.20]Be careful of dying.
[05:48.38]I'll be alright.
[05:49.16]Things hurt.
[05:49.98]I, like, don't remember what my items do or, like, I don't have much of a memory.
[05:56.03]Well, it is a weak angel statue.
[05:57.99]I'm going to get that.
[05:58.57]I want the rope just in case I need it.
[06:01.21]Okay.
[06:06.11]So what is the ore that we want?
[06:08.05]What is it called?
[06:11.49]Well, actually we need to go deeper.
[06:16.38]Holy shit.
[06:19.22]It stops right here.
[06:21.24]You didn't build the rest of the roller coaster.
[06:24.42]I didn't build this.
[06:26.25]This is just here.
[06:27.17]Underground.
[06:27.91]Oh, that's cool.
[06:31.86]We need mithril.
[06:33.38]You ever heard of mithril before?
[06:34.48]It's mithril.
[06:35.16]I'd say it's mithril.
[06:37.68]M-I-T-H-R-I.
[06:40.74]What does it look like?
[06:42.75]What color is it?
[06:45.17]Uh, it's much lower than this.
[06:46.23]Come back to the helivator.
[06:49.97]Jerma.
[06:53.99]Oh.
[06:54.37]Okay, that was part of the wall.
[06:58.06]He lied about the story?
[07:01.10]No, I said, if I don't play, then I'll tell the funny story.
[07:05.04]Oh.
[07:05.44]Look, let me just tell you something.
[07:09.82]Stop!
[07:10.30]That's so loud!
[07:12.66]This is one of the things we need.
[07:14.10]Zap Mithril.
[07:15.78]Ah, shit, I can't even get it?
[07:17.10]He hates that, by the way.
[07:18.37]That's his, literally, he fucking despises that.
[07:23.91]The I'm shaking the ice in my coffee around in a circle thing is, like, I may as well be, like, grabbing his ears and screaming at him.
[07:31.43]It's awful.
[07:32.17]It's so loud.
[07:34.12]Are you saying, like, oh, ha ha, he hates it.
[07:36.16]Everyone hates it.
[07:37.08]You guys hate that?
[07:39.44]Anybody in here hate that?
[07:40.18]Do it again for a test.
[07:41.12]Anyone who wasn't paying attention.
[07:42.66]Who hates that?
[07:45.24]Nobody.
[07:46.00]No.
[07:46.42]No.
[07:46.72]Not really.
[07:47.40]Not really.
[07:48.00]I like that sound.
[07:48.94]I like it.
[07:49.42]No.
[07:49.74]No.
[07:49.94]I'm not seeing any yes.
[07:52.50]I'm sorry.
[07:52.88]I think you just...
[07:54.81]You're being outvoted here.
[07:57.69]Outvoted?
[07:58.13]I thought you said we had to go down further, not, like, where... I was wrong.
[08:01.65]We, we need, we need to get Palladium first.
[08:05.31]Palladium.
[08:07.05]Yeah.
[08:07.43]I'm just... There's some right here.
[08:08.39]You see this orange looking shit?
[08:09.95]That orange stuff.
[08:10.95]That stuff is Palladium.
[08:12.29]Palladium.
[08:12.81]Yeah.
[08:13.49]Palladium.
[08:13.79]Palladium.
[08:15.95]Yeah.
[08:16.57]Make a joke.
[08:17.81]Quick.
[08:18.82]I thought you were quicker than this.
[08:19.72]Make a joke.
[08:20.96]I don't need to make a joke right now.
[08:22.82]Make a joke.
[08:23.74]This is the terrible Terraria tatterdays, okay?
[08:27.84]Why are they terrible?
[08:30.50]Oh, shit.
[08:31.02]I did just say terrible, didn't I?
[08:32.84]You did.
[08:33.98]Is it because it's with me?
[08:35.99]Oops.
[08:39.67]No, I like Terraria.
[08:40.89]It's fun.
[08:41.51]Are we just going to beat the game?
[08:47.10]What are you doing?
[08:48.52]I don't know.
[08:52.64]You keep changing your mind.
[08:54.24]You keep changing your mind on where you want to go.
[08:59.65]Over and over again.
[09:00.87]No, because you're like, oh, we're going to go deeper.
[09:02.33]No, we're going to go here.
[09:03.11]No, we need this.
[09:03.75]We need that one, actually.
[09:04.65]We need plenty.
[09:05.57]No, we need mithril.
[09:07.39]Go back down.
[09:07.99]Go back up.
[09:10.05]I just wanna, I'll just, you know, hey guys, so I was at the Dunkin' Donuts drive-thru today, and oh my goodness, could I not believe what I saw.
[09:18.06]I pull up, I've got a $1 bill in my hand to pay for my small coffee, and what happened to... Is that what you want?
[09:24.86]Is that what you want me to do?
[09:27.45]Yeah, please finish the story now.
[09:31.09]Why can I not jump off?
[09:31.97]Alright, here we go, I did it.
[09:36.01]Oh, fuck.
[09:38.27]That's a big wheeze.
[09:41.93]So, guys, I'm at Dunkin' Donuts.
[09:45.25]And I'm at the drive-thru.
[09:46.91]You really want to set up squad streams, huh?
[09:52.36]My chat always tells me to do it.
[09:55.16]And I give them what they want.
[09:57.74]Alright.
[10:03.56]Squad streams, okay.
[10:05.81]Stuart wants to squad with you.
[10:08.90]Except, I have accepted this.
[10:10.64]Are you gonna be in a mood the whole time today?
[10:13.84]This is not my fault.
[10:14.82]Alright, how hard can you wheeze without like getting hurt?
[10:19.89]Uh, I don't know.
[10:24.40]Like for instance, say something that's like a funny joke.
[10:37.81]I just hurt my stomach.
[10:39.27]Yeah, that's going to hurt me.
[10:40.39]I don't want to.
[10:41.19]God damn it.
[10:41.63]I'm actually, I hurt myself.
[10:43.48]I really just did.
[10:52.26]I like hurt myself.
[10:53.36]God damn it.
[10:54.14]I didn't even tweet this stream out.
[11:00.39]Oh no.
[11:01.29]You really messed up.
[11:04.49]Is that the title of your stream, too?
[11:05.85]Terrible Terraria?
[11:06.83]No, it's called Chunky Soup Stream.
[11:10.37]What does that mean?
[11:11.67]It's gonna be a long one.
[11:12.59]It's gonna be a chunky one.
[11:22.78]Okay.
[11:27.92]Let me tweet this.
[11:29.16]I'll get back to you in like ten minutes.
[11:31.82]I still don't have a magic mirror.
[11:33.51]I'm leaning back right now to stretch out, like, my stomach muscles that I just, like, ripped in half.
[11:38.55]Okay.
[11:39.11]Alright, so just keep playing.
[11:40.49]Just make sure, just get that, uh, the P.O.
[11:43.27]or whatever it was.
[11:44.97]Okay.
[11:45.37]I'll do everything.
[11:52.79]But I don't have a thing.
[11:53.79]I don't have the return-o-cone.
[11:56.37]The mirror?
[11:57.51]Didn't I give that to you?
[11:58.75]Last week?
[12:00.25]I gave it back to you.
[12:02.24]So do I have it?
[12:03.44]Let me see.
[12:05.88]I'm away from my keyboard right now.
[12:10.26]Alright, do I have it?
[12:14.38]I do.
[12:14.60]Do you want it?
[12:15.02]Should I give it to you?
[12:20.04]Is this a sign that you're giving up?
[12:21.22]You said you... Here, take it.
[12:26.14]No, no.
[12:27.20]I'm going to throw it into this abyss right now.
[12:29.46]You better catch it.
[12:30.12]Don't.
[12:31.52]Will it break if it hits the ground?
[12:33.94]It'll explode.
[12:34.72]No.
[12:35.18]The whole world will end.
[12:39.09]Here.
[12:39.97]How do I throw this to you?
[12:40.77]I don't know.
[12:44.11]I've never played this game before.
[12:46.01]It's not right.
[12:46.63]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[12:47.25]Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[12:48.39]There.
[12:51.72]So I'm going to keep looking for that ore.
[12:52.72]I'm looking for the orange ore or the other one, right?
[12:57.94]I'll see what I can do.
[12:58.58]Only the orange right now.
[13:00.44]Okay.
[13:02.44]Only the orange.
[13:03.44]Only the orange ore.
[13:06.76]Oh, what's that?
[13:07.40]Chad, you've got to help me out here, too.
[13:09.61]Get the ice hearts.
[13:10.59]People are saying get the ice hearts?
[13:13.15]Rune stones?
[13:13.71]Do we need those?
[13:16.61]Uh, no.
[13:16.81]We don't.
[13:19.69]We don't.
[13:20.05]Okay, well.
[13:21.24]Oh, right.
[13:21.54]Didn't you tell me don't ever listen to anybody in chat for this game?
[13:24.86]I mean, you can.
[13:25.48]You keep yelling at me for that.
[13:26.86]It's just that there's a decent probability they'll be wrong or they're really going to ruin your single-player learning experience by spoiling you.
[13:37.11]You know, it's like a game.
[13:47.46]Is it in a certain... Is this the biome that it spawns in?
[13:51.68]It's just everywhere underground.
[13:53.08]I mean, I'm assuming you've been down here.
[13:57.35]Usually not.
[13:58.81]Not a... Not that deep.
[14:03.45]So don't go down to hell, you know?
[14:05.15]No, I'm not in hell right now.
[14:06.59]No, I'm not, right?
[14:08.33]I am.
[14:14.68]What the fuck is going on?
[14:18.90]What the fuck is going on?
[14:20.06]Will you stop doing that?
[14:21.62]I'm trying to... I don't think it's a... Down here.
[14:34.57]So this is to get a better pickaxe, right?
[14:36.09]Is what you were saying?
[14:37.83]Yeah.
[14:38.31]Well, no.
[14:39.77]It's to get a better pickaxe.
[14:40.89]To get me thrilled.
[14:43.21]To get me thrilled.
[14:46.32]Yeah.
[14:50.35]like, basically everything.
[14:52.71]Thanks for not streaming on my birthday yesterday.
[14:54.37]I appreciate it.
[14:56.27]Happy birthday.
[14:58.45]You can't say happy birthday.
[14:59.25]Your birthday was yesterday.
[15:00.15]You missed it.
[15:01.37]Well, you don't know that.
[15:02.57]I could be, like, in Australia.
[15:03.93]I could be, like, a full day ahead of you in time zone.
[15:06.35]So you missed it by two days.
[15:14.47]Wow.
[15:18.81]I was gonna just do a huge wheeze again, but I really hurt myself last time, so I'm not doing that again.
[15:30.47]Why the fuck is this stuff?
[15:35.11]I probably have close to enough already.
[15:39.79]How much do we need?
[15:42.65]Not much.
[15:43.47]We just need enough to make a pickaxe so that we can get the better ores.
[15:55.41]They say, go to hell.
[15:56.83]What?
[15:57.45]What did you do?
[15:59.61]I didn't do anything.
[16:01.82]Oh, you... Dynamite.
[16:06.36]I'm so glad this is not like Minecraft where you just drop everything.
[16:09.60]Everything you die with, it just stays on the ground.
[16:12.37]There is a mode for that.
[16:13.73]Is there?
[16:14.01]If you'd like to play that.
[16:16.45]I don't think I'd like to play that.
[16:18.07]I'd probably be very bad at that.
[16:22.79]And then there's hardcore mode.
[16:26.35]There's a hardcore Terraria mode?
[16:28.77]Yeah.
[16:29.81]That's probably insane.
[16:31.87]I don't see any over here.
[16:40.71]I'm just gonna go up.
[16:42.37]What is all that shit on the mini-map in the top right?
[16:43.95]All the gold stuff.
[16:44.59]You see what I'm talking about there?
[16:48.86]Is that just sand?
[16:50.94]Yeah.
[16:52.16]So it's not up here.
[16:53.20]It's not up here.
[16:56.39]I'm gonna go see how much I've got.
[16:59.03]We cannot get that.
[16:59.89]Okay.
[17:00.79]Did you check up this way?
[17:05.99]I'm gonna go see how much I've got.
[17:07.31]This is lead.
[17:10.58]Lead's good.
[17:11.32]You're doing good.
[17:14.30]I'm proud of you.
[17:16.54]After doing that wheeze, this is going to sound kind of weird and gross, but I'm going to have diarrhea in like seven hours.
[17:21.62]What?
[17:22.64]Yeah.
[17:22.82]Like, me doing that wheeze just turned all the food in my stomach into diarrhea.
[17:27.81]And in like another eight to twelve hours, it'll be diarrhea.
[17:31.05]I liquefied all the fucking stool in my stomach.
[17:36.07]By wheezing.
[17:42.95]Okay, Jerma, I've got the pickaxe.
[17:45.90]Oh, so that's what chunky means.
[17:48.12]Oh!

[18:01.81]Uh, what is this stuff?
[18:07.65]Enchanted shard?
[18:08.74]Uh, that's irrelevant.
[18:12.12]What?
[18:12.38]It's irrelevant?
[18:13.14]It took... Ah...
[18:15.44]Yeah, sorry, man.

[25:14.87]How to occupy an idiot.
[25:25.29]I'm gonna be in a mood today.
[25:27.13]I'm in a mood every day.
[25:34.94]I don't know.
[25:37.12]Vlad, I don't think that's true.
[25:38.24]You haven't even complained about it being dark once yet.
[25:46.09]No, you've changed.
[25:46.93]Alright, I'm just gonna start firing them down here.
[25:56.55]Ooh, what's this?
[25:59.66]Enchanted shard!
[26:00.58]No, it's the same thing I got last time, instead of it wasn't worth it.
[26:04.16]Yeah.
[26:04.66]Oh, shit, that's lava!
[26:08.51]Oh, wait, oh, watch out!
[26:11.83]What are you doing?
[26:14.23]What are you doing?
[26:17.71]Ooh, what's over here?
[26:18.66]I think I found something.
[26:22.13]I don't think you did.
[26:24.65]I did.
[26:25.53]You see these little, uh, purple Pinwheels in the air?
[26:29.14]Uh-huh.
[26:30.74]Pick those up.
[26:31.54]Silver.
[26:32.18]Tin.
[26:32.90]It's tin.
[26:36.07]Corrupt mimic.
[26:39.03]Ow.
[26:39.43]Is that it?
[26:40.09]They're gonna die.
[26:41.17]Oh, yeah?
[26:41.53]Yeah.
[27:04.34]leave me alone you can't even see that thing on the screen he's just dumb how could you even how could you even see that uh I zoomed my eyes onto it you see these purple Pinwheels
[27:24.86]The purple Pinwheels.
[27:27.41]The spinning, glowing purple Pinwheels.
[27:29.67]Up there, yes.
[27:30.87]The soul of light.
[27:32.71]The soul of night.
[27:34.01]I got you.
[27:34.53]So find those.
[27:35.15]Any reason why they would drop?
[27:38.63]Killing enemies in this biome would drop.
[27:41.29]You got it.
[27:41.67]So every enemy around here that's dying that you're killing off the screen, and like AFK farming this zone, they're all dropping them.
[27:49.75]You got it.
[27:54.40]And they're used in, like, most recipes.
[27:58.07]Careful.
[27:58.57]Careful.
[27:58.85]This is bomb.
[28:05.57]You're right.
[28:05.85]It is fucking dark down here.
[28:07.61]Dude, it's, like, seriously?
[28:09.17]Who made the Earth this way?
[28:11.15]Oh, shit.
[28:20.48]Did that actually get me?
[28:24.30]I'm actually so glad that you're playing as the, like, AFK guy.
[28:37.15]Just any time that you have anything to say like that, just say that.
[28:40.50]No!
[28:42.58]Like, these things that travel through walls and kill things are the, like, this stage of the game, there's nothing better than it.
[28:51.33]Is there another one of those things?
[28:53.09]These mimics?
[28:54.49]I just never mind, you're an idiot.
[28:56.03]That's like what you want, that's how you want people to treat you, huh?
[28:58.53]No, no, the joke is that... Like, that's just, that's like, that's so overdone.
[29:04.17]That's like leaving the fucking steak on the grill for three days and you forgot it was on there.
[29:08.17]It's not a joke.
[29:08.97]It's not a joke, that was not the joke, and I think you need a little bit more self-respect.
[29:12.77]I think I killed the mimic.
[29:14.35]No, there's another one.
[29:16.41]Oh my fucking god.
[29:21.35]I'm just, like, going, you deal with that thing.
[29:23.01]I killed the last one.
[29:26.05]Can we not break this stuff?
[29:30.16]What?
[29:30.82]This needs a better axe?
[29:33.98]I think that's, uh, I forget what it's called in this world.
[29:36.58]Titanium.
[29:37.75]Grab that stuff in the lava that's down there.
[29:39.77]Because there's a lot of random shit in there.
[29:41.53]Okay.
[29:44.84]Tell me what to do again.
[29:46.64]Tell me what to do again and see what happens.
[29:50.71]Go get the items in the lava now.
[29:59.57]What happened?
[30:02.34]Oh, worm hook.
[30:05.50]What kind of hook do you have?
[30:07.18]I have the kind of stupid gel... I don't know.
[30:12.76]What is it called?
[30:14.26]It's the one that's like the... Right?
[30:17.94]I can't tell you.
[30:18.51]I think this one's a little better.
[30:21.25]I can give it to you if you'd like it.
[30:30.05]Maybe.
[30:30.27]I mean, I'm doing what you told me to do.
[30:31.79]I have a lot of these things.
[30:32.58]Okay.
[30:33.94]Okay.
[30:38.14]He's in one of those moods today.
[30:41.72]What's that supposed to mean?
[30:42.50]No, actually what you're supposed to say is, I'm Joe Dumb.
[30:51.30]No, no, no.
[30:52.02]It's, how do you occupy an idiot?
[30:59.37]I'm going home.
[31:03.29]Joe Dumb.
[31:06.12]What would my mother think about when you guys say that?
[31:08.75]You know what I mean?
[31:10.07]Imagine, like, being my mother who watches every one of these streams.
[31:13.93]Does she?
[31:14.35]Jerma, idiot.
[31:15.03]Jerma's so stupid.
[31:15.97]He's pretending.
[31:16.67]He's so stupid.
[31:17.17]Is he pretending to be this dumb?
[31:18.29]Who raised him?
[31:19.01]I've seen that one a lot.
[31:21.73]Who raised him?
[31:36.87]Ooh, I found some more of that stuff.
[31:41.48]Ooh.
[31:42.94]There's a lot of those down there.
[31:43.94]Am I gonna get hurt by this?
[31:46.54]Holy shit, that's a lot of stuff.
[31:49.16]Wow.

[32:31.29]To me!
[32:33.51]Wait, maybe not.
[32:34.93]Can I handle this?
[32:38.46]Yeah.
[32:39.26]I can handle this.
[32:41.42]Unless you're a baby.
[32:44.75]No, I'm good.
[32:49.01]Never mind.
[32:49.35]What'd he drop?
[32:51.97]Holy shit.

[36:47.55]What?
[36:47.89]It's not that big of a deal.
[36:48.79]You're fine.
[36:49.13]It sounds like you.
[36:52.95]You're putting me inside of a washer.
[36:56.21]I'm summoning this fucking boss.
[36:58.21]Don't.
[36:58.67]I seriously have a full inventory.

[38:06.15]Let me just do something here called, I'm going to spawn the boss when you're not ready, and I don't even know what this is.
[38:11.89]It's a worm!
[38:12.27]How many times have you fought worms before?
[38:13.94]It shoots fucking Portal 2 turrets everywhere.
[38:26.04]It's dead.
[38:27.26]It's dead.
[38:27.72]Did it die, like, in the wall?
[38:32.06]No.
[38:32.81]It died up here.
[38:37.37]Oh, I'm supposed to let you pick things up and look at them and go, ooh.
[38:41.41]Well, I was about to do that, and then you said... He's in a mood.
[38:55.68]They really only drop materials to make things.
[38:59.47]I picked up a bunch of shit down there and I go, I really want you to look at it.
[39:02.73]Hey, I'm spawning the boss now.
[39:03.89]What?
[39:04.21]Go.
[39:04.43]I don't even know what I said.
[39:06.49]I want you to look at it.
[39:07.50]When did I say I want you to look at it?
[39:09.76]You just said that I want you to be able to pick things up and look at it.
[39:11.62]That's what you just said.
[39:12.28]You said right now.
[39:13.06]No, I said pick them up.
[39:13.74]I didn't say look at them.
[39:16.16]You said to go, ooh, ah, look at that.
[39:21.77]What?
[39:23.15]Did he, alright, am I insane or did he not just say I want Jermba to pick up the items to look at them and go, ooh, ah.
[39:30.34]Am I insane?
[39:30.94]Oh, no, I was talking about the boss.
[39:34.14]You were talking about what happened in the freaking hole.
[39:36.44]I'm talking about both.
[39:37.94]Alright, so that was fun.
[39:43.59]Yeah.
[39:45.61]We have a lot of money.
[39:49.01]Alright, we need souls of light.
[39:51.59]I picked up a bunch of shit, though.
[39:52.71]I'm not even kidding.
[39:56.32]You know, look at it at your own... Souls of... You said souls of light, right?
[40:02.01]Light.
[40:02.25]Okay, souls of flight.
[40:04.99]Light.
[40:06.43]Souls of flight or souls of flight?
[40:09.79]Flight.
[40:12.93]Okay.
[40:13.63]So not souls of flight.
[40:15.89]Souls of flight are also important, though.
[40:17.62]Okay.
[40:18.66]Do you have those?
[40:19.72]There are seven in the inventory.
[40:22.14]Yeah, I know.
[40:23.42]Yeah, I thought maybe you had found some, but there's no way.
[40:25.66]I actually found a beam sword, and I saw at least 25 PogChamps when I picked it up.
[40:31.48]Okay.
[40:32.48]Is that good?
[40:33.16]I didn't get a chance to look at it.
[40:35.67]I mean, that's... What the fuck is that?
[40:38.03]Are you kidding me?
[40:42.68]Oh, you got to be kidding me.
[40:44.32]Am I right?
[40:50.84]I mean, I'm not a big fan of the proc rate on this.
[40:54.61]It only procs like once every second.
[41:04.51]Followed key.
[41:09.58]Quick diaper check.
[41:12.76]One of these days, you guys are gonna get me, like, banned.
[41:18.44]That'll be a... That's good.
[41:20.30]Twitch staff is gonna be like, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[41:22.48]We gotta check this guy's VOD.
[41:23.78]He's, like, he's showing a diaper, like, inside of a diaper on stream that he's wearing.
[41:27.33]We gotta check this VOD, this whole thing, in and out.
[41:29.11]I think best case scenario, you get banned.
[41:36.04]Because you only get banned for like a week and then you come back and everyone's like, what?
[41:41.70]What?
[41:43.04]Because everyone talks about you for a week.
[41:45.30]You know, Trevor got banned for like showing his diaper on stream.
[41:48.12]You come back and have like 100,000 people viewing.
[41:52.00]It's great.
[41:59.39]Dude, I heard about this guy.
[42:00.45]Yeah, he like wears a diaper on stream.
[42:02.53]Like, what the fuck?
[42:05.81]Yeah, he's not right.
[42:06.53]Alright, so this... I mean, there's some cool stuff.
[42:09.46]I... Can you check... Can you check the deposit area?
[42:17.04]Because I seriously just... You freaked me out.
[42:19.00]I had a full inventory and I threw everything in there.
[42:21.64]Wow, that's new.
[42:24.48]Yeah, but I didn't have even ten... I teleported to you and didn't even have ten seconds.
[42:28.54]You didn't even give me ten seconds.
[42:32.52]Now, you know what?
[42:33.24]I'm going to go do my own adventure.
[42:35.57]Go.
[42:36.53]Who needs you?
[42:37.05]I was gonna mute you and just do play Terraria in your server.
[42:43.16]Okay.
[42:44.38]I'll mute you and we can talk to each other next week like I said in the beginning.
[42:48.68]Where are you?
[42:49.04]What are you actually doing now?
[42:51.16]I'm looking for souls of light.
[42:52.80]Souls of light.
[42:53.44]And they're down in that area.
[42:54.68]You got it.
[42:56.00]They should be.
[42:56.62]There should be enemies that spawn them here.
[43:00.92]You know what?
[43:01.89]No.
[43:03.97]No.
[43:05.37]I'm going to take a look at the inventory, I'm going to look at the materials, and I want to see what you can turn the beam sword into.
[43:09.33]Yeah, do that.
[43:11.61]Because my viewers are fucking smart and they want to see combinations.
[43:16.59]And they want to see the intelligence part of the game, not just like I throw shoot stuff down in dungeons.
[43:24.00]What's going on?
[43:25.00]Steampunker has woken and there's like a... They're having a party.
[43:28.70]There's a Halloween organ being played.
[43:32.61]Here's what you do.
[43:33.41]Plug in the Soul of Night into the guy.
[43:38.51]And see what you can make.
[43:43.33]Well, where is... What can this turn into?
[43:50.08]Solstice Claymore.
[43:51.08]Oh my god.
[43:53.64]Changes projectile color based on the time of the year.
[43:55.92]Inflicts Daybroken during the day and Nightwither during the night.
[44:03.26]Wait, is it a blood moon?
[44:05.24]I just told you that there was a bunch of shit going on.
[44:12.70]Oh, blood moon.
[44:17.09]Pirate guy.
[44:18.97]Eclipse?
[44:20.07]Oh, this is the... Okay.
[44:24.01]This is a good event, Jerma.
[44:25.37]We gotta kill these things.
[44:26.53]Kill these things?
[44:27.97]Yeah.
[44:28.39]We're looking for broken hero swords and stuff.
[44:32.32]Well, I just got something pretty cool.
[44:36.05]Broken Hero Swords, um... What is that?
[44:44.43]I can talk to something up here.
[44:47.20]He's like an angel.
[44:49.08]Oh my fucking god, it's just a... Where'd he go?
[44:53.30]Ooh!
[44:54.16]Menacing Moonstone.
[45:06.96]So what eclipse is different than a blood moon?
[45:10.39]Uh, yeah.
[45:14.27]In there... I don't think I ever had a randomly spawned one.
[45:20.89]What is that?
[45:21.77]Tesla Defibrillator.
[45:24.51]There are too many items in the game.
[45:29.98]I don't even know what to do.
[45:32.20]It's too many.
[45:34.75]You know, it's because we're going too fast.
[45:36.29]If you're playing with yourself, take your time.
[45:41.76]You get to enjoy the experience.
[45:50.76]But I've ruined it.
[45:53.91]That tends to happen whenever you play a game with Ster.
[45:56.03]You just go to 100 immediately.
[46:00.37]But it's also kind of a good thing, because if I played this on my own stream, on my own, just, hey, I'm going to open up Terraria, and that's what we're going to do today.
[46:07.24]You would have done, like, two bosses.
[46:10.08]There would not be any mods.
[46:11.20]I'd probably be at 800x600 resolution.
[46:13.94]And I would still be in my first spelunking mission going down.
[46:20.75]I would have picked up, like, a 10 and thought it was cool.
[46:25.53]oh wow there's 10 whoa what do I do with 10 okay now we're getting going uh how long does this last even next week all night yeah I've never seen those vampire essence before what was that nothing why is this lady outside
[46:55.28]Vampire essence, yeah.
[46:56.84]Got it too.
[46:58.40]Any bosses come off of this?
[47:00.97]Um... There's one mini-boss, I think?
[47:08.17]Episode 54 and 55 of the Tin Ark.
[47:11.15]Yeah, and I would have... Okay, I'm gonna be careful.
[47:20.72]In the title of the story... I just got fucking air-shot by that guy.
[47:26.67]I'm gonna die out here.
[47:28.53]You don't even need to be out there.
[47:30.34]Just stand by the door indoors and watch them all go into the lava while your stuff kills them.
[47:41.22]Also take the worm hook.
[47:43.99]Um, anyways.
[47:44.89]I was gonna say, what was I gonna say?
[47:47.55]Oh yeah, the episodes will be titled, um, something funny and pop culture reference-y, like...
[47:56.21]uh Terraria episode 55 the adventures of tin tin me getting 10 for like four episodes oh I see what's wrong with this you don't stop getting tinsley I was like nine nine nine
[48:22.25]Okay, I understand the minus twos, but I'm saying that that would be a terrible thing to do.
[48:27.87]I love how you guys give me minus twos and plus twos for stuff that I didn't even do.
[48:42.46]If I think about a bad joke, it's -2.
[48:45.10]I can't even think about a potential bad piece of humor.
[48:53.82]If I opened up right now a recipe book... Those are all bots.
[48:57.25]No, if I opened up a recipe book and read how to make the best corn on the cob... Just the recipe itself would get a -2.
[49:09.24]Wouldn't even be me.
[49:12.36]No, Dermot, listen.
[49:14.58]Those are bots on Twitch that just show up and spam -2 all together.
[49:18.52]They're all owned by one person, and it's to make streamers self-conscious.
[49:22.40]Your joke was actually really funny.
[49:37.73]Dude, okay, I remember, so you mean like the -2 thing, right?
[49:41.19]I was playing Sam and Max a couple weeks ago, and jokes that Sam was making in the game, they were minus twoing me.
[49:50.13]That's how far we've gone.
[49:52.69]Oh yeah, that's what I mean.
[49:53.52]It's like, it's not even about you.
[49:54.72]It's just... It's not even about me anymore.
[50:01.76]I think they thought you made Sam and Max.
[50:15.21]Oh, you didn't make this?
[50:18.02]This is cool.
[50:21.07]See, now I see plus twos, but I made that joke.
[50:23.61]I'm not getting the +2.
[50:26.25]They're putting it in your channel.
[50:27.33]I know.
[50:29.59]There's a whole lot of... You know, there needs to be, like, a regulatory board that oversees the +2 and -2 market, because it's highly manipulated.
[50:36.16]Okay.
[50:44.74]So, what do you want to do?
[50:47.28]You didn't get any, like, broken hero swords?
[50:50.95]No, I don't think so.
[50:51.39]Oh, dude, I'm making Archelous.
[50:53.85]Do it.
[50:55.84]Don't you need the thing that I have?
[50:56.84]Uh, broken sword, right?
[51:04.08]I think I deposited one or two of them.
[51:12.75]Somebody said broken hero sword drops from Mothron?
[51:17.87]It's the mechanical bosses that drop the broken swords.
[51:21.05]No.
[51:22.79]Star is seriously not... He's really stupid.
[51:28.21]Star is fucking dumb.
[51:29.62]Star's an idiot.
[51:32.28]I have 500 hours in Terraria.
[51:34.02]Star just is being, like, annoying.
[51:36.26]That's weird.
[51:40.11]Weird?
[51:40.73]Yeah.
[51:41.39]That's just kind of weird.
[51:55.72]Dude, just imagine.
[51:59.68]Did I get anything that was worth using?
[52:01.22]I feel like I'm... Okay, you've got me in this position.
[52:03.94]Who's in the house?
[52:07.08]Oh, vampires teleporting.
[52:09.62]Which is weird because normally you have to invite vampires.
[52:12.68]That is true.
[52:16.06]Yeah, I don't think this game is actually accurate.
[52:19.99]I feel like everything I pick up...
[52:23.29]This is not as good as I have these aliens that go through walls and kill everything.
[52:28.32]Well, you're a summoner, and that's your whole point.
[52:31.94]I know.
[52:34.08]If you want to be a magician, you have been doing it wrong.
[52:37.61]I know.
[52:37.87]I'm just saying.
[52:39.57]Ster is smart and handsome and funny.
[52:46.07]Oh, yeah.
[52:51.16]I have this thing, too.
[52:51.86]I forgot about this thing.
[53:01.36]This is a very long eclipse moon.
[53:05.04]Well, I mean, it's all night.
[53:06.94]And nights are pretty long.
[53:09.36]So we just stay here until this is over.
[53:12.06]Is that why I'm getting antsy?
[53:16.36]I mean, you can go do whatever you want.
[53:17.98]I'm crafting the God Sword.
[53:20.12]And I'm changing my whole Terraria build.
[53:35.63]Ants in your diaper.
[53:36.71]Yeah.
[53:41.99]These things are really good, too.
[53:43.93]And this is not even a summon.
[53:45.27]This is a sentry.
[53:48.45]I'm Starboy now.
[53:50.25]Oh, you actually made it?
[53:51.81]Yeah.
[53:54.05]That thing looks pretty insane.
[53:56.55]It's melee damage.
[54:01.78]Go get him.
[54:05.51]very colorful yeah just brighten everything up just in case anyone wanted to be able to see what was happening on the screen who's the next boss um we have to summon we need the souls of light to get the last mechanical boss okay so after this moon is over we're gonna go get the mechanical
[54:33.00]Dust.
[54:33.42]Whatever the hell the thing is.
[54:35.84]Light dust.
[54:39.28]I want to make you a hollowed staff.
[54:44.12]Hollowed staff.
[54:48.36]I really want to replace the sand's head.
[54:51.83]I forgot how to make it.
[54:58.37]yeah I'm getting I'm just gonna store the sand said I don't like it I'd rather just do this this thing is cool too yeah I like this thing better oh you got tentacles oh yes oh yeah they're really not that great though
[55:28.33]Is the Eldritch Tomb a summoner weapon?
[55:33.39]No, I don't think so.
[55:34.95]I think it's just... I mean, technically it's a summoner weapon, but it's a material, though.
[55:39.39]What can I do with this?
[55:42.07]What can I do with this?
[55:45.91]This is the Augur of the Elements.
[55:47.15]Very fast.
[55:47.79]Average knockback.
[55:48.87]Burst of Elements with Pentacles to spear your enemies.
[55:50.69]Yeah, it's just a better version of it.
[55:51.83]What does it take?
[55:53.73]Tomb of Fates.
[55:56.28]What can I do with that?
[55:57.69]How do I get a Tomb of Fates?
[56:02.06]Shadowflame, Hexdol, Galactica, Singularity.
[56:06.12]Luminite Bar.
[56:06.94]Alright.
[56:08.26]Can you... Please.
[56:11.06]Okay.
[56:14.99]What can I do with that?
[56:15.61]Is there a mod list?
[56:16.93]Yeah.
[56:17.51]If you do Exclamation Point mod.
[56:20.95]But maybe not anymore.
[56:22.29]It was there before.
[56:26.89]Okay, wait a second.
[56:27.47]What can I do with that?
[56:29.49]You leave me alone?
[56:30.21]I'm just playing Terraria.
[56:33.71]Look at this thing.
[56:34.37]Cosmic Immaterializer.
[56:38.69]Eventually, maybe I'll make this one day.
[56:41.17]5,000 and some of the damage.
[56:47.92]Yeah, that's insane.
[56:52.10]This is a very long night.
[56:58.06]no it's not it's an averagely length knight didn't you know that this um you know what we also need to do what's that we need to go up into the upper layer in the sky we haven't done that yet until wyverns so that we can get souls of flight
[57:25.23]You know, when it's daytime, you're on wyvern duty.
[57:27.49]Or even right now.
[57:28.21]I think they spawn at night anyway.
[57:29.91]Yeah.
[57:30.54]They're really big, long snake dragons.
[57:32.88]And they drop fulls of flight.
[57:34.98]So just go up high, high, high for this guy.
[57:37.96]Yeah.
[57:38.24]High, high, high.
[57:40.26]Okay.
[57:42.95]And I'm going to try and find the underground hollowed biome.
[57:48.15]That's what I get for 50 bucks.
[57:49.57]Hold on.
[57:52.67]Is it gonna be the same joke again?
[57:54.79]I don't know, but I- hold on, I just- I'm looking off the screen.
[57:57.34]I think I just killed- what did I just kill?
[57:58.50]Was it a wyvern?
[58:00.34]What's going on?
[58:05.34]Essence of sunlight.
[58:07.86]Bowl of flight?
[58:09.40]Hold on, let me- I'm gonna die in here.

[58:16.80]I'm getting with, okay.
[58:17.88]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[58:19.12]Is that lava?
[58:20.66]I don't think so.
[58:21.93]We talking lava?
[58:22.61]Alright, what'd they say?
[58:23.69]It was Killer Crocomire.
[58:27.63]Thank you for the 50 bucks.
[58:28.67]They say, remember when this was a Salmon Max stream?
[58:31.11]Tomato sad.
[58:37.95]Well, thank you for the, that's a lot of money, but I've played all, I've played almost the whole thing.
[58:44.11]I've played through the first two full seasons of that game.
[58:50.44]We're gonna play season three.
[58:51.72]Don't worry, we are.
[58:54.58]How much higher do I have to go, Star?
[58:56.78]But seriously, that's a lot of fucking money.
[58:57.88]Thank you.
[58:58.10]Like, in space.
[58:59.26]Like, I'm floating right now.
[59:00.76]Is that high enough?
[59:02.12]Yeah.
[59:03.23]I don't have any ropes.
[59:04.55]I don't have any rope.
[59:05.25]I gotta come back and get some.
[59:16.58]And I am looking for bowls of flight.
[59:23.33]They're looking for the long dragons.
[59:25.01]Yeah, I already killed one.
[59:26.81]Yeah, okay.
[59:27.69]And then they drop souls of flight, and then you come to me, and you tell me I have them, and then I say, good job.
[59:33.71]How many do you want?
[59:34.51]I need you to come to me.
[59:39.88]The twins are fighting me.
[59:41.70]I need help.
[59:43.20]This is the last mechanical boss we need.
[59:45.54]I'm on my way.
[59:47.82]Randomly spawned on me.
[59:50.60]I'm going to base.
[59:51.18]What?
[59:51.70]They're going to follow me here.
[59:54.99]I wasn't ready for this.
[60:05.81]I think they might have left.
[60:07.69]They left?
[60:09.20]I thought it was about to be daytime.
[60:10.62]No, what the fuck is that thing called?
[60:17.53]You despawned him.
[60:18.41]Did I really leave?
[60:19.23]Fuck, dude.

[63:33.22]I've got to build a platform up here. I need some wood.
[63:44.25]Is there wood in the storage?
[63:48.33]Probably.

[63:59.02]He doesn't know that guy Pepe.
[64:00.34]Wait, what do you mean the soul's float?
[64:08.19]I'm confused.

[64:25.05]You know that it's too late for that.
[64:26.81]Episode one.
[64:28.17]Jerma starts fresh.
[64:32.35]Episode one.
[64:33.25]You won't believe what happens.
[64:36.21]And everyone in chat needs to be on their best behavior because his mom is watching.
[64:40.70]Terraria episode one.
[64:42.58]You won't believe what happens to me.
[64:46.02]And I just, I cut down like 10 trees.
[64:51.29]And I sneeze.
[64:51.61]What if someone did make that YouTube video?
[64:54.53]Oh, Terraria episode one.
[64:55.88]You won't believe what happens to me.
[64:57.48]And actually like 20 minutes in.
[65:01.83]Like something flies through his window and there's like bees everywhere in his room.
[65:06.47]Yeah.
[65:07.15]Someone throws a hornet nest in there.
[65:08.59]You would have no idea what happens.
[65:10.49]And it's just like, oh, it's just typical like a clickbait video.
[65:13.86]Yeah, I don't know.
[65:14.52]Like a giant ant like fights him in his room.
[65:18.94]He starts a fire like his house burns down.
[65:21.28]It's just, it's insane.
[65:22.88]You need to see it.
[65:23.92]Must click.
[65:24.68]I'm not clicking that.
[65:25.84]Must click.
[65:26.19]Must click.
[65:28.23]Terraria episode 2 making my first house click this something crazy happens.
[65:34.12]It's like a must watch must watch top videos of 2019
[65:40.19]Yeah, like a giant alien ant comes in, breaks through his fucking wall, and they have a fist fight.
[65:44.63]And he, like, knocks this fucking thing out.
[65:46.97]It's like an unbelievable thing.
[65:48.23]It's crazy because, yeah, Earth's first contact with intelligent life from another planet, and no one knows because it was posted on YouTube.
[65:57.04]Yeah, as like a Terraria video.
[65:58.52]It's a comic title, so no one ever saw it.
[66:02.54]I'm just waiting for these things to spawn.
[66:05.02]Hold S to dance.
[66:14.62]Wait, are you dancing right now?
[66:16.04]No.
[66:17.50]Must watch.
[66:23.82]And then episode three, it just goes back to normal.
[66:28.80]Like he just makes like a house in Terraria in the next episode.
[66:31.33]There we go.
[66:34.65]Would you watch the rest of that guy's videos?
[66:36.99]Absolutely.
[66:38.66]Would you skip to the end, or are you watching?
[66:40.92]I mean, if this motherfucker knocks out an alien on camera, like, I'm gonna subscribe to the guy.
[66:47.09]He may have saved us all.
[66:50.67]He's more interested in building his house than Terraria.
[66:59.89]Or he's doomed us all, yeah.
[67:08.47]I mean, the aliens were going to send backup, but they saw the video.
[67:14.36]The main commander of the alien forces gets addicted to his fucking Terraria let's play.
[67:20.54]I really want to see what he does next.
[67:23.88]It says I must watch.
[67:28.28]No, no, he's doing it wrong.
[67:29.98]Episode 12 says you won't believe what happens.
[67:34.43]I wonder if he killed another one of our alien commanders.
[67:38.19]No, no, you're doing it wrong.
[67:51.32]You're doing it wrong.
[67:52.74]I mean, he's the alien.
[68:00.27]He would know.
[68:02.29]Oh, God, am I dead?
[68:04.45]What was that?
[68:06.37]Tranquility element.
[68:14.88]Come on, spawn.
[68:16.24]Spawn!
[68:31.67]I don't understand.
[68:32.86]We were on our way to conquer Earth, but for some reason, I got really obsessed with this 10-hour Ayaya video.
[68:40.86]We can't invade anymore.
[68:41.84]This is quality.
[68:49.72]Yeah, we were going to kill them all and use their brains for fuel, but... Not when they come up with stuff like this.
[68:58.79]Not when they do this.
[69:06.20]What have you done?
[69:06.94]I'm having a great time right now.
[69:11.08]I'm just defending Earth from the aliens.
[69:15.22]I, uh... I don't know how to find what I'm looking for.
[69:18.94]I do have, like, fucking 22 of these things.
[69:22.35]Earth Elemental.
[69:22.95]Is that you or me?
[69:24.09]That's me.
[69:27.13]There's so many emotes for that.
[69:28.73]Is there?
[69:29.01]Look, I'm gonna be honest with you, guys.
[69:35.16]I just don't get it.
[69:36.24]I don't get it.
[69:47.28]Who's your favorite anime character?
[69:52.96]Edward Elric.
[70:02.33]Why is that funny?
[70:03.61]Because I don't like care.
[70:09.43]It's the only one he's seen.
[70:10.83]I feel like you should care.
[70:14.82]No, it's because he, it's because he's short!
[70:29.31]I'm gonna go Pyre.
[70:30.39]No, I'm gonna go this way.
[70:32.11]I'm gonna go that way.
[70:38.60]I'm gonna probably have like 30 to 50 of these things, so hopefully I'm supposed to actually collect these.
[70:44.48]And this isn't some big, like, jebait.
[70:47.64]Uh, I mean, you have enough.
[70:49.93]I have enough.
[70:51.43]Yeah.
[70:52.29]Okay.
[70:53.07]I think you might need to help me do something.
[70:54.47]Whoa, shit!
[70:54.99]I fell off the platform!
[71:01.05]What do you need?
[71:03.27]Uh, I'm trying to find a specific underground biome.
[71:09.12]I gotta say I'm having some trouble, uh, locating it.
[71:12.20]Okay.
[71:13.62]What do you want me to do about this?
[71:16.68]Uh, help me locate it.
[71:19.32]No, wait, hold on.
[71:25.06]Oh no, I wanted to catch it.
[71:27.09]No, why?
[71:28.65]Fuck.
[71:29.79]You're not busy.
[71:30.73]I love ducks.
[71:31.57]That just made me so sad.
[71:32.87]Okay, um, I'm coming to you.
[71:42.38]The point is to not come to me.
[71:44.70]Because we're both exploring the same spot.
[71:47.14]No, I was just doing... I was grinding for those flight emblems.
[71:54.41]Whatever the hell they are.
[71:55.31]The bowls of flight.
[71:56.59]The flight emblems.
[71:58.07]The flight gift of flight.
[72:00.71]No, that's a YouTube video that I deleted.
[72:09.01]Soul of flight.
[72:12.55]Oh, you've been getting souls.
[72:13.65]How many do you have?
[72:14.21]40.
[72:14.23]Oh, we only need, like, 20.
[72:18.50]Well, we got plenty.
[72:20.73]They're in the deposit box.
[72:22.90]Hey, go to the craft man.
[72:25.54]Craft man.
[72:25.86]Show him the soul of flight.
[72:27.46]You got it.
[72:28.24]And check out, find a wing that you think you can create.
[72:31.15]I think we have dragon scales.
[72:32.41]We have some other feathers.
[72:34.69]Dragon glass.
[72:36.19]But yeah, we're going to make wings, dude.
[72:39.79]Angel wings, demon wings, fairy wings, harpy wings, butterfly wings, bone wing, flame wing, frozen wings.
[72:47.57]I feel like I've had Buffalo Wild Wings right now.
[72:50.65]You are.
[72:51.07]This is a list of how hot they are and the different seasonings that are on them.
[72:55.85]Yeah.
[72:57.97]Okay.
[72:59.37]Bee wings.
[73:01.63]Do I have to sit here and read them all?
[73:03.75]Well, no.
[73:04.19]Just find one that you can make.
[73:06.75]Okay, feather, soul of light.
[73:09.15]We have 25 soul of light.
[73:14.98]No, Soul of Light is what I'm looking for right now.
[73:17.38]Demon Wings, I think, are probably the easiest.
[73:19.70]Demon Wings also, they need Soul of Night.
[73:22.91]Yeah, we have a lot of those.
[73:26.51]So what's the difference?
[73:27.49]Are they all the same exact thing?
[73:32.63]The ones that we can make are basically all the same.
[73:36.09]Do we have Pixie Dust?
[73:36.93]Because Fairy Wings are also available.
[73:40.71]There's like four or five.
[73:44.33]Harpy wings.
[73:46.80]I guess there's just speed, flight time.
[73:49.60]Yeah, demon wings are the ones we can make.
[73:52.28]Because we need soul of night.
[73:53.58]We need one more soul of flight.
[73:54.96]Because I have this 39.
[73:58.94]I take 40?
[74:00.15]What?
[74:00.99]It's 20 soul of flight to make one demon wing.
[74:03.73]So you're going to need one too, right?
[74:07.39]Oh.
[74:08.57]There's a frozen feather in the storage.
[74:12.28]that what do we need a frozen feather can make uh better wings oh really better demon wings oh ice okay oh yeah so we have a ice feather so who wants the frozen wings which which ones which ones do you want I was thinking look how about well I'll get like a couple and you get a couple and we'll split them
[74:39.81]Uh, rock, paper, scissors.
[74:40.99]Shoot.
[74:41.47]I was gonna get two bone wings, uh, two frozen wings, and then if you get the flame wings and the butterfly wings, you can have some of mine.
[74:48.96]Okay.
[74:50.02]Which one do you actually want?
[74:52.32]Whichever one's faster.
[74:54.18]That's the frozen one.
[74:56.22]So I'm just gonna make it and give two.
[75:06.52]Um, we don't... We don't actually have a frozen feather.
[75:11.36]Do we?
[75:12.20]What's going on here?
[75:13.04]We have some kind of special feather.
[75:14.10]Oh, it's ice feather.
[75:15.94]Um, we actually both can have ice wings, because we have two.
[75:19.37]Okay, yeah.
[75:20.07]I remembered finding a bunch.
[75:22.53]Okay, cool.
[75:23.87]So, um... Which one of these special tables do I need to make?
[75:28.45]There we go.
[75:29.07]Frozen wings.
[75:29.87]Got it.
[75:31.20]I need to find... Let me get one more.
[75:32.52]Um...
[75:37.10]essence of flight essence of kiss no because then you can have it too okay I mean whatever you say what are these what is equipped to is this like an accessory um yeah it's like a regular accessory slot should I put these on rather than put on the boots or should I keep the boots on experiment Jerma figure out for yourself let's see you know what do you want
[76:11.52]How long can you do this for?
[76:23.11]And you can just glide?
[76:25.43]So you'll never die from fall damage ever again?
[76:28.31]Oh, you can't take fall damage while you wear wings.
[76:30.47]Wow, okay, that's cool.
[76:32.73]Uh, ow.
[76:37.19]Take off the bracelet.
[76:38.97]Okay, yeah, that's a good idea.
[76:43.09]I want that mana though that mana alright I'm gonna get one more of those uh things do you have enough mana I cheated in the game how do we
[77:06.69]Somebody will get this.
[77:07.79]I'm gonna say it once.
[77:09.71]Oh, my mom's watching, so now you can't say sucks anymore.
[77:12.99]Huh?
[77:14.04]Even though my mom just said mobile sucks.
[77:17.54]But you can't say it.
[77:20.38]Because then she'll think that I'm hanging out with druggies again.
[77:22.46]Alright, you want the ice ones too?
[77:27.18]Yeah.
[77:28.29]Okay.
[77:29.07]Got one for me, got one for you.
[77:31.45]Yeah, ice me up, daddy.
[77:37.42]I love how you're, like, completely okay saying that with your mother watching.
[77:44.18]What?
[77:44.44]What's wrong with you?
[77:49.57]What, you're not comfortable around your mom?
[77:53.47]You, like, hide who you are around her?
[77:58.81]He's already... He's gone.
[77:59.55]That kid is not negative.
[78:01.83]Deposit my gold.
[78:02.97]Do I have too much gold?
[78:05.73]Oh, my God.
[78:07.07]Thank you for the reminder.
[78:09.73]Alright.
[78:12.99]I got you wings.
[78:16.35]Hopefully you like them.
[78:18.12]You are 4,600 feet away.
[78:23.76]That's far.
[78:25.42]Yeah, I'm trying to find this goddamn undergrammed hollow biome.
[78:31.90]What does this person do?
[78:33.22]Shot.
[78:34.30]Blood Moon Medallion.
[78:36.85]Oh, you can make it a Blood Moon for two gold.
[78:40.13]Summons, uh, this guy, that's cool.
[78:43.47]So you can just, whenever you want, have one of those invasions happen.
[78:47.33]Yeah.
[78:48.07]Huh, that's cool.
[78:49.59]But you had to have had it once, generally.
[78:52.38]I see, cool.
[78:53.32]Alright, do I need to do anything else?
[78:57.66]Yeah, you need to find this Underground Hollowed Biome.
[79:01.78]Underground Hollowed Biome.
[79:15.64]You're just wasting time fighting toxic sludges.
[79:17.88]You killed a hundred of them and you could have been helping me.
[79:25.11]Real cute.
[79:35.72]I can't tell if you were sneezing or somebody came in the room and put their hands around your neck.
[79:40.00]I was sneezing.
[79:41.92]You alright?
[79:42.30]Feeling better now.
[79:48.77]Shit, the alien!
[79:50.33]Quick!
[80:06.04]It tells her to find the inner edge of the non-natural evil biome and reflect it on the map to easily find the hollow.
[80:11.76]Do you know what I just said?
[80:13.26]Right there?
[80:14.74]I don't know.
[80:15.58]Right here.
[80:17.38]People that are watching Star Shed and my... Do I got it right there?
[80:23.18]The edge of the non... Yep, I got it.
[80:25.51]There's people saying I got it.
[80:28.71]What?
[80:29.77]Come to me.
[80:31.61]Where are you?
[80:32.77]At the edge of where the evil biome begins.
[80:36.51]Yeah.
[80:36.97]Right here.
[80:37.69]This is where it begins.
[80:40.15]Yeah, and I've been underground here.
[80:42.67]Right at the edge?
[80:43.43]Right here?
[80:45.27]Yeah, press M. I'm on the other end.
[80:51.13]We'll see how this goes.
[80:53.43]Well, no, I mean, like, press M and look below you.

[81:13.16]Oh.
[81:14.12]So you've already been down here.
[81:15.70]Well, yeah.
[81:16.42]Straight below you, I've been down there.
[81:20.58]Okay.
[81:21.53]Who's hitting me?
[81:23.11]The background shows it.
[81:24.15]Yeah, I see where... He's already done it, he said.
[81:34.73]Just do it anyways.
[81:35.50]Yeah, I mean, he may have missed it.

[83:50.32]I mean, I did find the pink ice, but it was like... Pink stuff, pink stuff.
[83:57.26]It was barely on my screen.
[83:58.90]It was a very small area.
[84:04.17]I think, is that you or me?
[84:06.39]That's probably me.
[84:20.59]Hey, it's me.
[84:23.33]I've got this pink stuff over here.
[84:28.29]Did I get it?
[84:28.77]I think I got it.
[84:30.61]Yeah, over here is the pink.
[84:32.17]And I just was like, this is, this is, there's like nothing here.
[84:43.58]I guess I shouldn't have been such a ninny.
[84:45.57]It's pink water, pink blocks.
[84:48.61]Come to where I am.
[84:49.67]I mean, I am where you are.
[84:50.93]I'm just below you.
[84:52.67]Yeah, but I want you to give me the wings.
[84:55.61]You ninny.
[84:57.51]Stop!
[85:00.39]No.
[85:02.25]I'm gonna keep bullying you until I get those wings, you ninny.
[85:15.20]I think we found it.
[85:17.12]Yeah, this is it.
[85:18.48]I was just a dummy and went a different way.
[85:21.46]This is it.
[85:23.22]I made it.
[85:25.70]Remember, it was me that decided to go this way and chat was right.
[85:29.73]What are you doing?
[85:32.15]How did I not take... Why am I not getting killed by that?
[85:42.23]You just dropped... Oh, it's because we're on the same team.
[85:45.81]Alright, here are your wings.
[85:50.07]Um, I don't want to drown, so just, like, give me boots somewhere else.
[85:52.84]Should we just drop them here?
[85:55.44]Yeah, but I don't think... We were just standing in face-high water.
[85:59.46]Yeah?
[86:01.92]Here.
[86:02.32]Take them.
[86:06.60]Did I get those or did you?
[86:09.27]Uh, you might have, because I'm picking up slush blocks.
[86:12.71]Here.
[86:15.66]Thank you.
[86:16.52]Uh, yep.
[86:17.46]Uh, you're welcome.
[86:20.94]What's that cool thing over there?
[86:23.08]It's The Legend of Zelda thing.
[86:26.40]What is it called?
[86:26.82]Clefairy?
[86:32.33]Dude, I love Clefairy.
[86:36.63]Pearlstone?
[86:38.57]Hey, Mom!
[86:40.23]Mom!
[86:41.88]What's your favorite Pokémon?
[86:47.96]The mother taste test.
[86:50.94]There are wrong answers.
[86:54.58]Oh, I know what it is.
[86:55.30]Actually, I already noticed.
[86:57.38]It's fucking Norlax.
[87:00.70]That's a good choice.
[87:04.23]Ten.
[87:09.13]Okay, so we found the biome.
[87:12.93]Now we need the pink glowy Pinwheels.
[87:16.81]I think this is a good place to stop.
[87:18.89]Thanks for joining, guys.
[87:19.59]We'll see you next time.
[87:21.77]Also, you see these crystal shards on the walls?
[87:24.45]Yes.
[87:24.59]So, like, glowy crystals?
[87:25.79]You need those.
[87:27.31]The ones, like, that are bright?
[87:28.33]Okay.
[87:28.81]Yeah.
[87:29.65]You have to, like, go up to them.
[87:30.95]Why do you look strange?
[87:32.80]Why are you just like a... You're just like a dinner napkin.
[87:36.36]Because I have rogue items on that make me invisible-ish.
[87:40.80]So it's just my wings showing for some reason.
[87:48.18]Ooh, what about these ones?
[87:48.94]These things are cool.
[87:50.38]These, uh... Soul of Light!
[87:52.88]Ooh, we need these, don't we?
[87:54.00]Yeah.
[87:58.04]Nice.
[88:04.89]Fucking space.
[88:09.89]The Evanstone blocks are worthless, right?
[88:14.25]Can I confirm that with you?
[88:15.64]Yes.
[88:17.88]confirmed what about rotten chunks worthless we have like 90. okay what about uh worm tooth worthless alright what about pink ice block worthless purple ice block worthless ice block don't want it I thought I thought that was a cowboy make a cute heist home ice home ice

[89:29.25]Ooh, you got me!
[89:35.56]Crystal shard, crystal shard.
[89:37.38]I'll take that.
[89:48.64]We probably have enough.
[89:51.98]What the hell is this thing?
[90:01.85]Intact Geode.
[90:04.43]Also might be useful.
[90:06.35]I don't know if we're past it yet, actually.
[90:20.00]Um, it doesn't hurt, but not really.
[90:23.66]Well, it's here.
[90:25.42]It's unlikely we'll use it.
[90:27.98]Just in case, I'm gonna get it.
[90:39.98]Alright.
[90:41.48]Uh, what about, is there more up there?
[90:45.31]Where's that ice?
[90:46.95]Where's this stuff?
[90:50.34]Am I out of fucking room again?
[90:52.50]Yeah, I'm super out of room.
[90:53.92]I feel like half of this stuff is just worthless.
[90:57.36]The heck is that?
[91:06.69]No, I'm not doing a diaper check!
[91:10.09]Stop!
[91:13.13]Can you please though?
[91:33.62]I'm just getting all this ore and I just feel like I'm going to get it.
[91:39.10]We're here.
[91:39.51]We're probably never coming back here ever again.
[91:41.07]Ideally.
[91:51.37]Everyone's asking for you to make a JoJo record.
[91:54.43]I have not seen JoJo.
[91:57.50]So it's hard for me to do.
[92:05.44]Okay, I got all that.
[92:06.63]You think we have enough crystals?
[92:07.57]I have like seven or eight.
[92:10.49]Yeah.
[92:10.77]I have a bunch.
[92:14.75]I did beat the Fighting Gold Beat Saber level, though.
[92:17.95]So... Did you do all of JermaCraft?
[92:20.63]The whole thing?
[92:23.04]No.
[92:23.78]I didn't.
[92:25.50]I mean... I did the Rat... We are the Rat Song, and I did the It's Your Birthday Today, which are both on Beat Saber.
[92:32.03]Yeah, you didn't do JermaCraft episode one.
[92:34.21]It's like 16 minutes long.
[92:35.55]I didn't do it.
[92:37.18]I wouldn't be able to beat it.
[92:38.56]I'd stop a minute in.
[92:39.54]I'm just so obsessed with picking up all this stuff.
[92:45.40]I've got to get out of this.
[92:46.04]These wings are so good.
[92:48.56]Yeah, I know.
[92:49.18]Good thing I did all that grinding.
[92:51.53]Yeah, dude.
[92:52.03]You're fucking... I'm going back to town.
[92:58.21]I'm going to open up this chest and I'll join you.
[93:06.06]Magic mirror.
[93:06.90]Ooh!
[93:07.74]Ooh!
[93:09.48]Found another magic mirror!
[93:12.60]Is that an enemy stand?
[93:14.18]Uh, gold.
[93:18.94]Give me that.
[93:20.12]Flame and arrow.
[93:21.36]Yeah, I don't need that.
[93:22.64]Dynamite.
[93:23.16]I've got plenty of it already, but I think I'll just put it up here.
[93:25.44]Just have it up here, I think.
[93:26.38]Uh, suspicious looking eye.
[93:28.38]I don't know what that does.
[93:29.47]Um, what's suspicious looking eye?
[93:32.49]summons the Eye of Cthulhu.
[93:36.41]What is this thing?
[93:37.40]Help!
[93:38.30]Hello?
[93:39.54]Okay, I'm coming to help.
[93:41.88]I just didn't know what it was.
[93:42.78]I was freaking out.
[93:43.56]I want to make sure you don't die.
[93:48.46]Help!
[93:48.74]Help!
[93:51.68]That was such a polite help.
[93:53.46]I could have been like, help!
[93:55.53]But instead I was like, help!
[93:56.21]Help me!
[93:56.85]Help!
[93:57.37]Help!
[94:06.55]Help me.
[94:08.09]Don't die here.
[94:08.75]Anything good?
[94:13.53]There's a magic mirror in here.
[94:15.21]Do you have any room?
[94:18.89]What the hell was that?
[94:20.63]What was that Jerma985 thing you just shot off?
[94:23.72]That's the crystal vial shard.
[94:26.50]I don't have any room.
[94:31.04]Listen.
[94:34.14]Listen?
[94:34.50]Get the magic mirror in there.
[94:37.15]I have one.
[94:37.79]You get that magic mirror.
[94:38.91]I don't have any room.
[94:41.46]I'm out of space.
[94:42.66]I need to go press the deposit button.
[94:46.48]I know I have so much crap.
[94:48.24]I know.
[94:48.61]Okay, I'm putting the mirror inside the box.
[94:52.25]I am back.
[94:54.67]Okay, good.
[95:05.27]Okay, and I'm throwing this on the ground for you.
[95:07.87]It's like a... It's a thing.
[95:15.03]Ooh.
[95:26.50]Summons a massive crystal spike.
[95:28.12]What can I turn it into?
[95:36.30]Hellburst.
[95:38.52]It has a beam of flame.
[95:41.00]Oh my god, our thing's full.
[95:42.36]He's gonna get so mad at me.
[95:46.19]Have you been dumping shit in here?
[95:47.85]There's one... Oh my god, I am mad at you.
[95:50.97]I don't know.
[95:53.39]Oh, nine cobwebs.
[95:54.75]But do you understand?
[95:56.97]Like, there's fucking thousands of items in this game, and I've never played it before.
[96:03.40]You brought me to a big dinner.
[96:07.05]You brought me to a huge dinner that has... No, you brought me to a buffet.
[96:11.95]I'm at a buffet right now.
[96:12.99]The biggest buffet in the world.
[96:15.73]And you have me by the hand dragging me around.
[96:19.35]You gotta try that.
[96:20.21]You should try that too.
[96:21.37]Oh, no, no, no.
[96:21.73]I'm telling you.
[96:22.17]The peach cobbler is so good.
[96:24.11]Come over here though.
[96:25.53]And watch out for the boss.
[96:26.43]Watch out for the monster like firing.
[96:31.14]Yeah, there's just aliens and monsters everywhere too, but oh, come on.
[96:33.36]No, try that.
[96:34.60]Have you ever had the pizza here?
[96:36.30]I don't know what the pizza is.
[96:37.90]No, try it though.
[96:38.46]It's good.
[96:39.61]I don't know what pizza is.
[96:47.98]I'm sorry for you, dude.
[96:52.25]He doesn't even know what pizza is.
[96:54.39]You keep giving me more stuff to try, and then... There is one singular throwable spiky ball in here.
[97:04.43]I don't want to go to a buffet.
[97:05.99]I'm scared of the boss.
[97:11.40]The boss.
[97:14.20]This is like a monster.
[97:15.34]He's got like a chef's hat on.
[97:21.84]I think I'm going to try to make that thing.
[97:24.20]There are 38 musket balls in here.
[97:28.24]Like, what's wrong with you?
[97:29.92]This is one of those games where you just auto-pick up stuff.
[97:32.83]Look, I told you, if I played this game by myself, the first, like, three times would be like, this is what 10 does.
[97:42.25]I now know what 10 is.
[97:44.91]I know, but I'm saying these things to, like,
[97:49.28]Because me saying them out loud, hopefully you understand why this is stupid.
[97:55.38]In the future, there isn't like a copper axe in here.
[97:58.26]We have five bands of regeneration in here.
[98:01.42]Yeah, but I don't know.
[98:04.60]It's like, I don't, look, I don't want to throw something away and it be, because there's so many odd, unique items.
[98:11.63]This is what I'm talking about.
[98:12.85]No, you can't make an argument for literally putting two silt blocks in here.
[98:20.03]There's no defense.
[98:24.33]Oh, and you're collecting furry tails?
[98:36.20]I don't have any defense for that, but it's because I'm depositing.
[98:39.45]Because, look, go back.
[98:41.75]I want you to go back to this whole entire, like, YouTube 75 episode Let's Play this.
[98:47.09]Every time we come...
[98:49.43]I'm making a point.
[98:50.55]I'm making a point.
[98:54.29]No, but every time we come back to town, I have a full inventory, and then all of a sudden it's just like, Here comes a boss!
[99:04.10]Get out here!
[99:04.88]There's a fucking worm!
[99:05.96]And I'm just like, oh shit!
[99:08.78]That was one time.
[99:09.98]No, that's happened like ten times.
[99:15.97]Actually, no, there were three enchanted armor spellbooks in here.
[99:22.14]There was a two-stack and a separate one.
[99:30.99]Damn it, I can't do that.
[99:39.01]One.
[99:39.19]I'm trying to put one in two slots.
[99:41.91]Okay.
[99:42.85]I want to make that a... Let me see if I can make that.
[99:44.83]What the hell is it called again?
[99:48.31]I don't know, man.
[99:51.91]You just, like, got under my skin there for a second.
[99:56.47]Oh, you've been under mine.
[99:59.09]You've been under mine, buddy.
[100:02.51]Like, don't you know, I know that when you, like, we made this the World of Warcraft reference before, but if you're, like, a level 80 in WoW, and you convince someone to play World of Warcraft, and you've done every dungeon before, that person's not gonna know what to do with Linen Cloth.
[100:17.52]Didn't you actually invite me to play World of Warcraft when Legion came out?
[100:19.10]And you hated every second of it. You literally made fun of it to the point-
[100:23.38]I out DPSed you and I fucking crushed you.
[100:28.01]No. You complained for 4 hours and then like everybody left the call.
[100:35.42]That's exactly what happened.
[100:36.42]That was the first time, then I actually played Legion. The first time I was a huge complainer.
[100:42.55]There was, like, six people in this, like, TeamSpeak call.
[100:45.64]And over four hours, you just see, like, has left the channel.
[100:49.60]This is so fucking dumb.
[100:50.76]This game sucks.
[100:51.46]Like, why doesn't everybody play this game?
[100:53.26]And they'll see Stealth has left the channel.
[100:56.10]Oh, this is so boring.
[100:57.88]This game is so bad.
[100:59.85]Two and a half hours later, Boo has left the channel.
[101:01.67]It's just me and you in there after, like, four hours.
[101:07.51]That's not how it happened.
[101:08.59]That's exactly how it happened.
[101:10.03]That actually is not how it happened.
[101:12.01]Yes, it is.
[101:13.37]No.
[101:17.84]Do I get to tell my story or am I guilty?
[101:20.08]You're just guilty.
[101:22.16]Okay.
[101:23.56]Do we have a flamelash?
[101:27.32]No.
[101:27.54]Where do we get flamelash?
[101:29.08]I want to make this.
[101:30.26]I don't know what that is.
[101:31.86]Google it.
[101:32.68]Flamelash Terraria.
[101:38.36]Flamelash can be made by using the hell bars.
[101:41.98]Do we have any hell bars?
[101:42.74]Hell bar.
[101:54.79]Hell bar.
[101:55.35]You mean hell stone?
[101:56.91]Is it like the magma bar?
[101:59.43]Should I make this thing?
[102:00.19]I'm just going to make it.
[102:05.35]Fuck it.
[102:05.63]Why not?
[102:10.07]What's it called?
[102:14.95]These recipes are so obnoxious.
[102:17.41]Not magma.
[102:20.10]Actually, I might be wrong.
[102:21.22]I'm sorry.
[102:21.86]Please don't make me the one guy.
[102:23.52]Oh.
[102:26.14]It's alright.
[102:27.10]It's alright.
[102:33.41]How do I make that?
[102:43.21]Yeah, alright, I'm sorry, but like, oh, Jerma, like, how do you not know all this?
[102:48.03]When there are enough bars in this game so far that equal an ice cream store worth of fucking flavors, I'm sorry, this is just the bars.
[103:05.89]Give me a break.
[103:08.23]You can't make a flame lash, y'all.
[103:14.90]It just got real quiet.
[103:15.94]That was weird.
[103:16.44]What's going on?
[103:17.52]Are you here?
[103:18.36]What?
[103:18.98]Yeah, what?
[103:20.88]This is weird.
[103:21.64]You guys hear this?
[103:23.06]It's like too silent.
[103:27.86]Oh, it was the rain.
[103:29.16]Right, okay.
[103:29.50]That's freaking me out.
[103:31.68]Alright, so do we have enough to do the thing you wanted?
[103:34.02]The boss thing?
[103:38.32]Flamelashes found in shadow chests in the underworld.
[103:40.98]Okay, cool.
[103:54.34]Put this back.
[103:55.76]I'm going to just try this, though, because 26 magic damage, that sucks.
[104:03.36]This is 24.
[104:03.82]Are you done crying?
[104:06.83]The sand's eye is still the best thing I have.
[104:10.25]I'm not going to do that.
[104:12.83]Where'd it go?
[104:22.30]Oh.
[104:24.13]Let me see this.
[104:32.47]I mean, it's kind of cool.
[104:38.56]It's kind of like the vile thorn, but it's just a straight line out like that.
[104:45.56]People say we should find a shadow key.
[104:49.03]Do you agree with them?
[104:59.99]Hello?
[105:02.89]Oh, yeah.
[105:03.55]Sorry, I was looking at crafting recipes.
[105:05.55]Okay.
[105:10.51]Are you okay with that?
[105:11.38]Like, are you upset?
[105:12.42]Check your- check diaper.
[105:13.96]Shake around.
[105:14.60]Check diaper.
[105:15.22]Guys, there's nothing in my diaper, okay?
[105:16.50]I'm gonna shake around.
[105:19.64]There's nothing in here.
[105:22.08]God.
[105:26.38]Okay, did you put those souls of light in here?
[105:31.43]Yeah.
[105:37.31]There's like nine of them.
[105:43.10]Okay, we're fighting a boss tonight, Jarmo.
[105:44.88]Are you ready?
[105:51.92]Yeah.
[105:56.26]No, I'm not ready.
[105:57.30]I'm not ready.
[106:06.85]you not hear that you must not have heard that you would have been pissed I had my volume down for a little bit and also anything that was recent I did not hear where's the potion guy oh there he is I have a shadow key nah I'm good
[106:30.92]Cliffon.
[106:31.24]Do you?
[106:31.98]I kind of want to hear that.
[106:33.36]On my own time, though.
[106:34.36]Like, not on stream.
[106:35.44]Because it was disgusting.
[106:38.28]Did he just blow a fart?
[106:40.22]No.
[106:41.80]Are you going to summon the thing over here?
[106:44.78]Yeah, like, give me one second.
[106:46.74]Well, then fine.
[106:47.38]I'll be like, thank you for the $50, you chunky baloney.
[106:52.00]This is my kind of chunky stream.
[106:55.04]You are chunky baloney.
[106:56.36]Thanks for the $50.
[106:56.68]5,000 bits.
[107:01.36]That's a lot of fucking money, man.
[107:03.76]Can you stop swearing?
[107:05.10]My mom's watching.
[107:06.10]There's a lot of freaking money, man.
[107:09.96]Okay, Jerma.
[107:10.81]I'm gonna ask you kindly, like, one time.
[107:13.37]Well, would you kindly, yeah?
[107:16.07]Help me fight this boss.
[107:17.31]The twins have awoken.
[107:23.41]Are we focusing on one eye?
[107:26.97]Right eye or left eye?
[107:28.81]I don't know.
[107:33.01]We are equally doing damage to different eyes.
[107:36.21]This is not efficient.
[107:56.72]I don't know.
[107:59.02]Ooh, he's got a gun out.
[107:59.98]I don't know.
[108:00.72]He's got a cannon.
[108:01.24]Dude, that was a top tier dodging right there.
[108:07.38]Oh, I had it.
[108:08.06]I almost didn't get hit at all.
[108:13.28]I mean, these wings I think are like way faster than we're supposed to have at this point in the game.
[108:19.32]You should be dodging pretty good.
[108:22.85]I am.
[108:29.17]Ooh, hollowed bar.
[108:37.58]The twins.
[108:38.10]I'm invisible.
[108:42.00]The biomechanical watchers.
[108:42.93]Are you also invisible?
[108:44.73]Oh, no.
[108:45.33]The biomechanical...
[108:49.68]Hello?
[108:49.88]I don't like this because I can't see who I am.
[108:51.00]Somebody said he is on drugs.
[108:53.00]Hey.
[109:20.93]Alright, can you do me a favor, though?
[109:23.01]Can you confirm with everybody watching right now that if the cameras weren't rolling, I'd be doing the same shit?
[109:35.17]No.
[109:39.62]He puts on an act.
[109:41.30]Now I know you're bullshitting.
[109:45.38]He's a lot more violent off-screen.
[109:47.86]God damn it, you motherfucker.
[109:49.32]And verbally abusive.
[109:50.24]Stop!
[109:55.96]What, were they not supposed to know?
[109:58.08]You want me to lie?
[110:05.48]You're a liability.
[110:06.50]What are the boss?
[110:11.24]We need more hollowed parts.
[110:17.05]I think I picked up some.
[110:19.75]Yeah, I know, but I want more.
[110:21.69]You want more?
[110:22.37]Between us, we're probably going to use a lot.
[110:28.60]Oh, it's this fucking thing again.
[110:29.80]I hate this thing.
[110:50.44]I want to hit like all the way up like this.
[111:08.80]Stop!
[111:12.22]Leave me alone.
[111:26.01]That thing sucks.
[111:36.51]Why would you say that?
[111:38.10]Because it's just annoying.
[111:38.98]It just covers the whole screen and releases like 30 little ads that shoot lasers in every direction.
[111:44.84]Yeah.
[111:45.50]so what you're like sad that you can't avoid all those lasers he's still using sans laser in hard mode what a casual is that a casual thing to do
[112:01.33]I want to get you the Hallowed Scepter thingy, but I don't... I don't know how to... Oh, there it is.
[112:06.71]I have... I have 25 Hallowed Bars.
[112:08.67]Here, use this.
[112:09.35]I threw it to you.
[112:10.07]I threw it to you.
[112:10.75]I fucking... It's... You have it.
[112:12.60]Well, you take these, then, because I don't, like... Take them.
[112:17.66]Did you get them?
[112:18.10]Okay, I took them.
[112:18.94]Yeah.
[112:20.06]Okay, 55 magic damage, low speed, very weak knockback.
[112:23.38]Summons a barrage of enchanted swords at the Mouse Curse's location.
[112:26.54]56 versus 55...
[112:34.64]The really good thing about that is you can cast it through walls in the ground, which also shows you if you want to find resources.
[112:42.32]But also that multi hits like crazy.
[112:44.00]Like if we fight that here, you know what we're going to do?
[112:46.37]We're going to fight that boss again just so you can see how much damage you freaking do.
[112:54.67]Okay.
[113:00.01]Wow.
[113:01.72]Because it hits every single segment with all those.
[113:07.26]That is pretty insane.
[113:10.27]I just burned all my mana though.
[113:21.11]I hate this thing.
[113:27.39]There's hearts everywhere above here.
[113:29.15]I'm picking them up.
[113:56.62]I do look very dangerous.
[114:00.87]This thing is pretty awesome.
[114:01.75]Oh, did you see the DPS meter at the end there?
[114:03.53]Is there a meter?
[114:04.95]You're so far behind me.
[114:08.45]There's actually an item you can put in your inventory to see your DPS.
[114:14.84]But I don't have it.
[114:15.96]Bad because trash because terrible because awful.
[114:21.16]Bad.
[114:21.76]Trash.
[114:22.54]Terrible.
[114:23.36]Bad at the game.
[114:25.42]Bad player.
[114:26.30]Trash.
[114:31.98]Okay.
[114:33.84]What can I... I really, really like this to a point where I want to see what this can be turned into.
[114:37.92]I think the person's dead.
[114:39.89]I think we have to kill another.
[114:43.63]Is the crafting guy dead?
[114:47.03]Where's Jeffrey?
[114:49.19]I think he's actually dead.
[114:52.13]We need to kill another.
[114:54.53]Another?
[114:55.85]I don't have enough holobars.
[114:58.71]Oh, no, I do.
[115:00.13]I knew, like, they had to be somewhere.
[115:01.47]I threw you, like, 25.
[115:02.61]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[115:18.08]Stop yelling.
[115:19.48]What?
[115:22.86]Buy the blue juice from the purple wizard guy.
[115:24.59]Makes it so you don't run out of mana.
[115:25.83]Yeah, I actually had potions before.
[115:27.59]We just kind of... I have a bunch in the inventory I've got to pick up.
[115:35.53]Are we fighting that thing again?
[115:37.63]Uh, no.
[115:40.11]No?
[115:40.37]Okay.
[115:46.51]But is Jeffrey dead?
[115:47.75]Is the crafting guy dead?
[115:50.16]I think so.
[115:51.44]No, that's too bad.
[115:55.64]make a mana flower, it automatically uses mana potions when out of mana.
[116:03.42]You know what, that is too bad.
[116:04.40]Look at these NPCs.
[116:10.42]Like, look at this.
[116:13.12]Spend Metals?
[116:24.38]No, it's just like a board.
[116:26.10]You can just like cosmetic stuff.
[116:33.75]When am I going to play DOS?
[116:36.37]When we're done with Terraria.
[116:39.98]Oh, he's going for a long one tonight, you guys.
[116:42.04]Don't worry.
[116:42.58]You're going to be in for a treat.

[116:54.39]Oh, pog.
[116:56.45]Pog.

[117:02.89]Pog.
[117:12.56]Enable pog.
[117:13.46]I already have all five of my slots taken up.
[117:21.71]Buy the better mana... Who has the mana potions?
[117:23.84]The good ones?
[117:27.26]Not the shitty ones?
[117:27.90]Because these are lesser mana potions.
[117:32.71]Does he have any better ones?
[117:33.79]He only has these ones.
[117:43.11]Um, I can give you mana potions.
[117:44.87]Get rid of the dancing jello guy?
[117:47.83]Here, I have 78 greater mana potions.
[117:51.31]I don't even know where you got these.
[117:52.67]I don't even understand how you got these.
[117:54.62]I've been getting them all the game.
[117:56.34]Alright, so disable the jello dancing guy that no one uses.
[118:01.44]That's the first time I think I've seen that since I enabled it.

[119:35.63]The guy's dead to, like, check the crafting stuff.

[119:55.68]Popo.
[119:56.78]Popo.
[119:57.82]It should be his name.
[119:59.46]The guy who sells potions.
[120:00.84]It's Fizban.
[120:08.89]There's nobody in here named Popo.
[120:09.97]Bernard.
[120:11.15]Bernard the Potion Seller.
[120:12.57]Bernard.
[120:13.17]Why would you say... I'm walking around in circles.

[120:36.51]There's money in the storage.
[120:37.51]There should be.

[122:56.29]I've never made one before, and I never will again.
[122:59.15]This noise is annoying.
[123:02.87]I feel like it's slower.
[123:03.93]That's not going that fast.
[123:10.56]I think it just seems that way because I'm not swinging it.
[123:14.77]I'll rapido.
[123:18.93]Battleflesh is not doing shit.
[123:22.73]This is kind of terrible.

[126:41.74]How much is this potion?
[126:44.02]It's like 10 gold?

[127:41.22]After you kill 900 pixies, I think you're done.
[127:43.40]Well, we'll have plenty of pixie dust.
[127:57.64]I'm safe.

[128:47.10]Hey, I feel like I'm physically playing Diablo 3 again.
[128:54.55]That's not even a joke.
[128:55.93]This is what that game turned into.
[129:01.09]Just do Nephilim riffs and just hold the right mouse button down while numbers explode on your screen.
[129:08.46]Somebody got in?
[129:30.48]I want unicorn banners.

[129:49.77]Yeah, place them on the ceiling here.
[129:55.21]What is this doing?
[129:56.79]Increases your damage against unicorns.
[130:00.07]That's so dumb.
[130:01.65]This is dumb.
[130:03.89]I'm stuck in here now.

[133:08.52]I don't have a boss.
[133:09.94]I can't even pretend.
[133:15.16]The game is lagging because I'm trying so hard.
[133:17.51]I'm gonna die.
[133:28.82]Alright.
[133:29.78]What on Earth can I even do now?
[133:32.16]Yeah, in comparison, that battle potion wasn't doing so good.
[133:37.16]Wow.
[133:39.38]50 summon damage?
[133:43.95]Summons a flesh-eating zombie.
[133:48.47]They're not gonna, like, seek targets like these things do, though.
[133:51.25]No.
[133:53.29]These don't get replaced for a while.
[134:08.29]Banners, banners, banners.
[134:09.87]What am I doing?
[134:10.81]Do we even need leather anymore?
[134:11.97]Is this just a yellow coat?
[134:22.88]Wait, no, it's not... You threw all your unicorn horns and stuff in here, right?
[134:30.10]I dumped literally everything in there.
[134:35.78]You can equip the apple.
[134:37.06]You get a mount.
[134:40.28]Where does it go?
[134:41.32]Wait, where did that just go?
[134:42.12]Um, that's gonna replace your frog transformation.
[134:46.67]That's alright.
[134:48.69]Is it?
[134:53.23]Is it, though?
[134:53.83]Heavy blood drinker.
[134:56.18]Ugh.
[134:58.38]Do you need the blood drinkers for anything?
[135:00.36]I don't think so.
[135:06.82]Can I have two raincoats on?
[135:15.18]Do you want these, uh, eviscerating claws?
[135:19.69]No.
[135:20.27]I'm not doing throwing anymore.
[135:22.45]We need the pharaoh's breath for anything.
[135:25.79]No.
[135:28.35]Nope, don't need the carnivore tail.
[135:29.66]Don't, I'm just gonna, I don't care, I'm selling it.
[135:32.42]At this point, like, what am I gonna do?
[135:34.30]You know what I mean?
[135:40.87]What?
[135:41.19]Oh.
[135:41.31]It's a ghost.
[135:50.42]Uh, here.
[135:50.84]Take my drill.
[135:52.00]For your pickaxe.
[135:55.70]Uh, lay down.
[135:57.00]It's really nice.
[136:02.77]Phylactery Lich gave $50, and they say, Jeremy, tell Star thanks for making you play Terraria.
[136:08.36]Because it convinced me to download it, and it's a blast.
[136:10.48]I just beat Kalamitas.
[136:15.46]That's a big boy.
[136:16.58]He's really been at it.
[136:19.15]Oh, hey, thanks, Star.
[136:19.85]You can go outside every once in a while.
[136:24.93]Thank you, Star, for getting me into Terraria.
[136:27.91]And thank you, Phylactery Lich, for the $50.
[136:31.11]Thank you, Star.
[136:36.18]No, but that's a huge amount of money.
[136:37.06]Thanks a lot.
[136:37.70]That's fucking a lot.
[136:38.68]5,000 bits.
[136:43.78]Every eighth magic cast costs no mana.
[136:49.05]That's... I'm getting rid of that.
[136:52.23]You're not going to touch this ever again when Star finishes it?
[136:54.61]Yeah, but we're going to beat the game.
[136:58.73]Oh, no, no.
[137:03.54]I'm going to.
[137:05.97]Hey guys, I'm gonna beat Terraria on stream I can't believe you're not gonna go back to this after you beat it What?
[137:24.63]Beating Terraria I don't like the way that looks
[137:36.42]I wanna commemorate the time we killed a thousand fifties in one minute.
[137:40.26]You just gave a full upper row of teeth to our building.
[137:44.54]Yep.
[137:45.08]We have to now make another mouth down here.
[137:46.80]You gotta put a bottom row of teeth down there.
[137:49.57]Nope, we only have a top jaw.
[137:51.67]Aww.
[137:51.77]Alright, there's a boss we can fight in the underworld right now.
[137:56.93]Well, should we...
[138:00.12]I want to put this away, and then this thing.
[138:04.47]You said that the zombies suck, right?
[138:08.55]Yeah.
[138:12.21]Just because they walk around and don't fly.
[138:17.17]True.
[138:18.33]Call load staff.
[138:21.19]I need a broken hero staff.
[138:23.73]Or twin's ire.
[138:30.81]I wonder which one of these is better.
[138:31.88]The true hallowed staff?
[138:32.86]That looks pretty good.
[138:34.64]I haven't used it, but the hallowed staff is really good.
[138:37.94]So how hard is it to get a broken hero staff?
[138:42.80]Not very.
[138:43.52]We just need to summon the eclipse again.
[138:53.75]I got my mount.
[138:58.96]Cool.
[139:01.00]Alright, so you wanted to do the, uh, next, uh, enemy, right?
[139:04.12]Yeah.
[139:05.86]I'm not even gonna pick that shit up on the ground.
[139:09.16]Would you go to the left?
[139:12.43]Uh, we have to go down.
[139:13.13]The bagpipe?
[139:13.67]The hell?
[139:15.59]I just picked up a bagpipe!
[139:18.43]There's been a few of them.
[139:25.41]No!
[139:26.97]Come to hell!
[139:32.80]Hey!
[139:33.32]Hey, Jerva!
[139:34.46]It's me!
[139:39.21]Remember?
[139:40.15]I remember.
[139:46.02]That's cool.
[139:47.32]I would never use this weapon, though.
[140:04.58]giant clam again it's probably gonna it's gonna do like the Mario ground pound down through this whole thing isn't it what no you have to attack it before it will follow you but won't this my guys just attack randomly no they don't target it no
[140:34.16]Okay, so who's this guy we're fighting in here?
[140:36.65]Uh, I don't remember.
[140:38.71]He's a guy.
[140:39.29]I think I've only ever fought him when I was way over, way past his power level.
[140:45.47]So I don't know what he actually does.
[140:48.15]Or drops.
[140:50.31]Okay, well we got a nice open area here.
[140:52.12]Uh, you ready?
[140:55.10]Is there anything I need to know about this guy?
[140:57.38]I don't know anything.
[140:58.38]You don't know anything about this guy?
[140:59.84]Okay, so I'm just going to take my potions.
[141:01.38]Let's go.
[141:05.13]I didn't get any potions.
[141:08.74]That's okay.
[141:10.06]Where's my item?
[141:11.72]I just took them all.
[141:12.78]I got like two minutes.
[141:13.71]Yeah, I know.
[141:38.33]Whoa!
[141:39.83]He broke the ground there.
[141:40.87]What did he drop in there?
[141:49.65]I don't know.
[141:52.13]What did he drop?
[141:52.89]Let's see.
[141:54.47]Is this an item or his body?
[141:55.83]Nasty Thermogenic Impaler.
[142:00.32]Melee damage.
[142:03.36]This looks kind of cool.
[142:09.21]You're not laughing!
[142:09.73]You're not laughing!
[142:10.35]You're not laughing!
[142:11.03]Alright, get over here.
[142:12.35]Look at this.
[142:14.39]What?
[142:15.29]This is like what he dropped.
[142:18.37]He also dropped this drill.
[142:23.83]No, that drill I gave to you.
[142:25.68]Oh, did you?
[142:26.38]Yeah.
[142:27.26]You just didn't want him to do it.
[142:34.88]My boy!
[142:35.38]I'm like dead.
[142:38.66]Yeah, he didn't really drop anything.
[142:39.68]I can summon him again.
[142:40.56]I mean, their drop chances are very... I need health.
[142:46.41]Don't summon him yet.
[142:47.31]I need to stand still to regenerate.
[142:56.58]Where do I have potions?
[143:00.42]Didn't I have them?
[143:01.08]Did I just deposit those fucking things?
[143:02.48]I think I did.
[143:03.26]Do you see this?
[143:06.24]Yeah, what is that?
[143:08.62]It shows where... Yeah, it's where my cursor is.
[143:11.23]So you, like, don't lose it, but you have to waste an equipment slot.
[143:17.37]I kind of wish I had that, to be honest, because sometimes you can lose your cursor very easily.
[143:23.02]Yeah, but I don't want to use an accessory slot for, like, nothing.
[143:37.75]I'm ready when you are.
[143:40.36]Yeah, you actually might be at the point where you need new armor.
[143:44.58]But I don't know if any of the current armors give as many summons as that one does.
[143:53.25]So I don't know which armor would be good for you.
[143:54.97]I'm summoning bosses.
[144:13.29]Lead your target.
[144:14.14]Lead your target.
[144:15.02]Lead your target.
[144:30.91]That looks elaborate in there.
[144:33.75]Don't stand on it.
[144:35.09]It hurts.
[144:39.01]Okay.
[144:39.53]Hellstone Brick.
[144:41.29]What are you giving me?
[144:41.89]Demonic Bone Ash.
[144:43.35]I just got another Impaler.
[144:47.05]Demonic Bone Ash.
[144:48.09]Is that worth anything?
[144:50.57]No.
[144:51.29]No.
[144:53.49]Oh, well.
[144:53.85]Too bad.
[144:56.36]Uh, stay here.
[144:57.74]Stay here.
[144:59.78]I will.
[145:03.22]Aye aye.
[145:03.56]Uh...
[145:11.59]Try to get flame lash while I'm down here.
[145:15.03]Yeah, didn't you say it was in like a chest or something?
[145:20.66]I want to fight the wall of flesh again.
[145:22.96]It drops a couple things we could use.
[145:27.90]Sure.
[145:30.94]The bone ash is an ingredient in the zerg potion.
[145:35.05]We can just buy zerg potions.
[145:36.51]No, it doesn't matter.
[145:41.38]Uh... Uh... Oh, it's on the other side.
[145:59.67]That was very, very, very easy.
[146:03.01]Yeah.
[146:03.37]I remember how scary... That's how much stronger we've gotten.
[146:06.71]Corruption key?
[146:08.76]What's that?
[146:16.39]Cursed by a powerful jungle creature.
[146:21.79]Is it 0.1% drop?
[146:25.43]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[146:26.47]I got the corruption key.
[146:27.51]People are freaking out.
[146:33.13]I have the hollowed key.
[146:34.17]I don't really know where... I think you... If I'm correct, you have to kill plant terror before you can use any of those.
[146:40.47]And then they're in the...
[146:44.34]dungeon but not always I actually don't know it is saying go to the corrupted chest on the dungeon yeah but I think we have to kill plantera first um what was the name of the key corruption corruption key my chat's saying correct well we can start um
[147:09.08]Preparing to kill Plantera.
[147:11.64]We haven't really been to the jungle at all.
[147:13.08]That's the next thing we really need to do.
[147:14.90]Use the key to open the corruption chest in the dungeon after killing Plantera.
[147:18.73]Yeah, I have two hollowed keys as well.
[147:28.01]What is this?
[147:28.39]This thing's kicking the shit out of me!
[147:38.74]What the fuck is this thing?
[147:42.88]What is this thing?
[147:44.19]Seriously, this guy's kicking my ass.
[147:54.29]Um, chat rooms.
[147:55.51]What is the best armor we can get for Gerber right now?
[147:58.64]God damn it.
[148:00.14]Oh, there was a mimic?
[148:05.98]Ugh.
[148:08.28]apparently pedal armor he currently he has the dungeon armor from before hard mode we're looking for summoner armor sir just ignored you I went back home
[148:34.73]You were saying, what is this thing, which is what you say every 10 minutes.
[148:38.01]So, like, it wasn't a big deal.
[148:39.93]I don't know, man.
[148:40.85]There was no boss meter.
[148:41.89]The Mimic usually, it says, doesn't a Mimic usually have a boss health bar?
[148:46.96]Yes.
[148:47.76]It didn't have a health bar.
[148:49.56]It had, it's just a standard enemy health bar.
[149:00.01]I'm just gonna sell this shit, whatever.
[149:06.91]Alright, the corruption key is in the stash.
[149:10.83]Okay.
[149:12.85]Our inventory's full.
[149:15.65]I know you're going to go in there and you're going to be very mean to me.
[149:19.13]I know you are.
[149:23.38]Well, see, it's because you're the one that fills it and then I have to clean it.
[149:33.72]Oh, well.
[149:37.57]Obsidian Rose.
[149:40.61]Equippable.
[149:45.59]The Darth Plogus copypasta was too long.
[149:49.13]I don't even know what that means.
[149:56.83]I need more hollowed bars.
[150:03.97]Again.
[150:11.48]What do I got for potions?
[150:14.20]Magic power, summoning pot, obsidian pot.
[150:17.14]I mean, where's the mana pot?
[150:23.24]Life regen, max health, magic power, obsidian skin regenerate, there it is, magic pot.
[150:41.74]I think we actually need more houses.
[150:44.58]Because we haven't had a traveling merchant in a long time.
[150:49.04]I really want this upgrade here for the true hallowed staff.
[150:51.28]Broken hero staff.
[150:59.12]Well, we can do the eclipse right now.
[151:01.41]Will I get a broken hallowed staff from that?
[151:05.91]Um...
[151:11.04]yeah really a broken hero staff yeah are you lying to me I'm not no that's what drops today uh the guys aren't selling the thing to summon the eclipse but I know where to get it I think
[151:41.19]I know it might be confusing things.
[151:46.44]Are you?
[151:48.22]Anyway, at night time I need to fight the mechanical bosses again.
[151:51.20]So I can upgrade our storage so it's not always full.
[151:58.19]Who do I have to give the glacial crystal to?
[151:59.97]I think that guy died like 12 hours ago in game time.
[152:11.49]Oh, this guy, Ernest, right here?
[152:13.11]Okay, so how do I do it?
[152:24.28]Do I have to have it in my inventory?
[152:27.06]Probably.
[152:27.56]Oh, there we go.
[152:33.69]Hey!
[152:35.92]Thank you.
[152:37.24]I think I can give you another quest if you need it.
[152:39.10]Come back later.
[152:39.80]You're welcome.
[152:43.08]What was the point of that?
[152:45.01]Adventurer's Loot Box.
[152:48.11]Loot Box!
[152:51.73]Some good shit in here.
[152:52.57]20 Highload Bars?
[153:02.22]Okay, there was a box inside of the box.
[153:06.70]Wait, wait, you just got hollowed bars from it?
[153:08.67]Ooh!
[153:15.07]Hello?
[153:16.39]I can't put this anywhere.
[153:17.45]Our house is not big enough.
[153:22.70]You made the ceilings as tall as we are.
[153:25.26]I can't put my cool painting down.
[153:26.54]If it's one higher, then you have to grapple to the ceiling to talk to people.
[153:30.70]I got 20 hollowed bars from that box.
[153:32.37]Here, take them.
[153:33.61]Thank you.
[153:35.24]How much can I sell the painting for?
[153:37.12]Nothing.
[153:44.56]Okay, now our storage goes up to 520, so you can just keep dumping all your useless shit in it.
[153:50.08]Really?
[153:52.90]Thanks.
[153:55.91]Alright, where we going?
[153:57.57]Well, now I have all these mechanical boss summons.

[160:23.32]There it is.
[160:26.18]Avenger Emblem!
[160:27.78]Bingo.
[160:29.44]So that's just plus 12% more damage.
[160:36.15]What's my favorite K.K.
[160:37.19]Slider song?
[160:38.97]Uh, the one where he goes, Quack, quack, quack, quack.
[160:43.01]Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
[160:45.63]Probably that one.
[160:46.15]Are you enjoying that?
[160:51.86]Huh?
[160:53.46]You enjoy- enjoying quacking?
[160:59.28]There's a f- You put a fucking grave in here.
[161:02.84]It just keeps getting worse.
[161:14.52]I remember putting it in, too.
[161:16.66]I specifically remember putting it into that box.
[161:21.72]Melee, knockback, pickup range, 15% magic damage.
[161:25.56]That's pretty good.
[161:26.18]Ooh.
[161:35.75]Prime necklace.
[161:40.49]Do we have a pygmy necklace?
[161:51.93]I don't think we do.
[161:52.57]No.
[162:02.15]We do not.
[162:05.57]Well, for now, that's fine.
[162:06.41]Alright, we got that one.
[162:08.73]What about this one?
[162:09.35]Angry Fear Monger.
[162:14.80]Wait, you're angry at me?
[162:17.28]What did I do?
[162:18.04]There's a turn undead.
[162:20.18]I don't want that.
[162:20.80]I didn't do anything.
[162:25.14]I need to replace that.
[162:29.40]I need a better accessory.
[162:30.73]Something else.
[162:31.39]Why do I have this on?
[162:32.87]Do we have any accessories in here that I haven't been using?
[162:43.58]Where do I make chains?
[162:50.66]Oh.
[162:51.92]A badoy.
[162:54.92]I think I'd rather have the mana regen.
[162:56.84]What's this?
[162:58.96]No.
[163:04.92]Fire damage on attack.
[163:07.50]Hmm.
[163:09.04]That sounds interesting.
[163:09.82]Let me look at it.
[163:12.83]Cross barriers.
[163:13.57]Sandstone boots.
[163:23.76]Light underwater.
[163:29.16]I can put this on, can't I?
[163:31.04]Decreases non-minion damage by 10%.
[163:32.41]Hmm.
[163:32.71]Do I really care that much?
[163:41.83]I guess I could have more of these out.
[163:50.17]I don't know.
[163:53.64]It's just 5% damage reduction is really good too.
[163:55.80]I thought that was magic for a second.
[164:08.27]I was like, wait a minute.
[164:16.60]No.
[164:18.78]No.
[164:19.86]I'll just keep on the 5% damage reduction for now.
[164:25.30]Yeah.
[164:25.84]Okay.
[164:27.75]Alright.
[164:28.67]I'm ready to do whatever you want to do next.
[164:43.25]That's trash.
[164:44.47]Hold on.
[164:44.81]I'm getting to the bottom of this.
[164:47.50]What's wrong?
[164:50.38]Oh, shit.
[164:50.92]I do need a honeycomb.
[164:53.15]How did I go down that route?
[164:56.91]Well, we don't have a honeycomb.
[164:59.39]We don't have another panic necklace.
[165:00.77]My life is ruined, Jerma.
[165:04.51]I thought I was going to be happy.
[165:11.11]No?
[165:11.47]What's wrong?
[165:14.79]Okay, let's spawn all my friends.
[165:18.04]And then from here, let's do a dive.
[165:20.90]Where's my drill?
[165:23.10]I got rid of it.
[165:23.72]He said it was too bad.
[165:28.26]We're going to the jungle.
[165:29.75]Either way.
[165:34.13]Which is far left.
[165:36.47]Okay, far left.
[165:38.65]Do we need the corruption key?
[165:39.63]Because I don't have it.
[165:40.95]No.
[165:42.23]Okay.
[165:54.15]If I pass you, I get $1,000.
[166:01.00]Host advantage.
[166:01.64]We're here.
[166:12.92]You did not pass me.
[166:14.03]You do not get $1,000.
[166:15.13]Okay, so we need to go down into the jungle.
[166:20.88]I'm so fucking mad about that I'm not paying attention.
[166:24.73]Say it again?
[166:25.15]I need you to pay attention right now.
[166:27.55]While I'm explaining to you.
[166:28.65]Yes, yes, yes.
[166:29.33]I'm ready.
[166:30.79]Okay, so there's a thing called Plantera's Bulb.
[166:32.85]It's like a little flower that spawns.
[166:34.85]Your minions won't auto-attack it, but when it gets destroyed, Plantera gets summoned.
[166:39.44]Okay.
[166:40.84]Don't destroy it.
[166:42.06]When we find it, we need to make some room.
[166:43.86]Don't destroy the shell.
[166:45.32]Okay.
[166:47.93]also keep green dragon scales and any uh turtle shells you find queen bee has a welcome that's my lucky day okay certainly have oh this is just fire right now
[167:15.82]Alright, what do you got?
[167:17.20]Anything worth picking up?
[167:18.18]We got Bee Wax Stinger.
[167:20.73]Did she drop any honeycomb?
[167:23.63]No.
[167:24.13]I'm looking for honeycomb.
[167:26.41]Just pink gel.
[167:31.03]Piece of shit.
[167:33.72]I never liked her anyway.
[167:35.40]So, let's keep going down to find the Plantera.
[167:55.30]I'm looking.
[167:55.66]Oh, I didn't get that.
[168:06.65]Oh yeah, we need to get you new armor.
[168:10.77]Or thanks, spider armor.
[168:28.86]10.
[168:30.14]Boys and girls, we got 10.
[168:33.10]Spider nest.
[168:34.66]And then you kill black recluses until you get enough spider fangs.
[168:39.06]Ooh, life fruit.
[168:39.82]What's life fruit do?
[168:42.28]Oh, that's really good.
[168:43.14]That increases your max health over 400.
[168:45.18]It's like the next step.
[168:46.71]Really?
[168:48.27]Yeah.
[168:48.75]Ooh.
[168:55.11]What's that blue for over here?
[168:56.69]Is that anything?
[168:57.27]Let's see.
[169:18.62]This is Palladium.
[169:30.87]So how obvious is this thing?
[169:32.19]Is it huge or... Remember the cysts that we destroyed for the other boss?
[169:39.68]Yeah.
[169:40.90]It's like that.
[169:41.44]Okay.
[169:42.32]You can also actually even see it on your map.
[169:45.94]Really?
[169:47.57]It's a... It'll show up as a pink 4x4 square.
[169:52.34]Pink 4x4 square.
[169:54.22]There's a chest right there.
[170:00.40]Oh, I can already mine Chlorophyte.
[170:01.68]I didn't realize that.
[170:05.80]Also, actually, you stay here.
[170:09.82]Polunker Potions show it and all that.
[170:12.04]And they also show Life Roots.
[170:15.51]You guys can't get over the diaper, can you?
[170:28.04]Thorns?
[170:29.70]Um, is there a shotgun?
[170:39.80]I just picked up a shotgun.
[170:44.62]You won't.
[170:46.56]You're a little baby.
[170:47.82]It was kind of crazy.
[170:49.34]It was a shotgun.
[170:51.62]Ooh, ooh.
[170:57.17]Is there any reason to use the pick over the drill?
[171:00.48]Uh, the drill is just annoying.
[171:01.76]I mean, the drill is just annoying, yeah, I guess.
[171:16.17]How am I stuck in here?
[171:23.04]Oh, we can't even use life for kit.
[171:26.19]I think we have to use like going down too far, or is this like new bee biome?
[171:30.21]What's that thing?
[171:30.69]No, it's just... It's like a little guy craft.
[171:34.57]Oh, rescue him.
[171:36.26]Do what you want.
[171:36.76]Alright, we got a queen bee, so... Need my honeycomb.
[171:59.23]And I see honeycomb.
[172:01.38]I see it.
[172:04.76]Unless that was something else.
[172:05.74]I think I'm out of fun room.
[172:11.14]You didn't get any drops from it?
[172:12.16]I think I'm out of space.
[172:14.88]Leather, get out of here.
[172:15.74]I got everything, but I did not get honeycomb.
[172:18.76]Tin ore, get out of here.
[172:20.20]Fuck, dude.
[172:34.22]Should I eat the heart now, but should I wait?
[172:43.72]You can't eat it yet.
[172:47.72]You need to get 400 health and then there's some other step that I'm not... I think I know what it is.
[172:55.66]Let's throw the bomb.
[172:58.08]it would be really easy to get 400 health by the way if you want to go do that while I'm looking for the bulb um where's the best place to get that the fire stuff uh so you go down to hell then go left okay you know how there's like a ceiling to hell yes they kind of there's five flame hearts that just kind of line the ceiling uh I had been left and right and gotten a lot of them
[173:26.09]so a lot of them are gone but it's just above hell very slightly okay so just get down to hell yeah go left though I I got more from on the right than I did on the left who's that there's no hearts in here I put the um
[173:56.32]I put that life... The... The life root.
[174:00.68]It's in the storage.
[174:02.08]Is that one?
[174:07.91]Oh, I found a bulb.
[174:10.25]Find blazing hearts.
[174:11.79]Alright, I'll go do that.
[174:13.41]I'm going to hell.
[174:20.25]I... Wait, what?
[174:21.75]You dead?
[174:22.09]I just assumed I was at full health.
[174:25.63]Apparently not.
[174:26.57]I want, like, some red glows on... You know how, like, you get shot?
[174:30.19]I very much appreciate that.
[174:34.02]So you're saying get down to hell and then go left and just look for them.
[174:38.26]The ceiling above hell.
[174:40.18]So, like, if you're on the platform, you're not going to be able to see it.
[174:42.56]You kind of have to check the ceiling, and they're, like, very... They're, like, right there.
[174:47.63]Okay, let me see if I can figure out... What do you mean by that?
[174:51.27]Let's see if I can figure it out.
[174:53.49]Because this is hell, right?
[174:56.31]I think I'm in there.
[174:57.07]I think I'm at hell now, right?
[174:59.23]Is that not quite... The place with all the lava?
[175:02.04]Yes.
[175:02.48]At the bottom?
[175:03.98]Yeah, I know.
[175:04.66]But, like, is hell very large?
[175:08.12]Yeah.
[175:11.82]People are saying, no, go further down.
[175:16.25]Further down?
[175:16.69]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[175:17.23]All the way at the bottom.
[175:19.47]Okay.
[175:19.73]Alright.
[175:25.35]So then you say, go left.
[175:32.90]Why can't I jump?
[175:41.01]OK, I'm good.
[175:53.34]Alright, looking for Blazing Hearts.
[175:55.26]I'm on it.
[176:06.92]Nice.
[176:10.98]Dude, I love Edward Elric.
[176:12.32]I just found the Philosopher's Stone.
[176:13.84]Did you?
[176:15.60]I did.
[176:17.64]Very cool, man.
[176:20.51]That's very cool.
[176:23.69]I just love Eddie.
[176:25.19]I wish that he would come to me and show me what it means to be a boy.
[176:32.79]You just, like, said words.
[176:34.60]You just said words out loud.
[176:37.28]It doesn't matter what they were.
[176:40.22]Exactly.
[176:40.82]We call that word soup.
[176:46.75]Oh, my God.
[176:47.67]Edward L.
[176:51.73]Okay, looking for... Looking for it.
[177:03.86]What happened?
[177:06.74]You couldn't put the fire out.
[177:08.34]Fire?
[177:08.72]Oh, I can't stand on those, right?
[177:16.04]Alright, okay, never mind.
[177:19.19]Yeah, forgot about that.
[177:26.40]Here, maybe next time put the fire out.
[177:29.94]Alright, let's do it again.
[177:46.22]I'm gonna die again.
[177:53.60]This weapon is not fun underground.
[177:58.97]For some reason, I just thought they were the same material here.
[178:07.14]Almost got me again with that little trapdoor.
[178:09.00]Alright.
[178:16.53]Do not stand on these.
[178:18.87]It doesn't work that way.
[178:19.91]I kind of need to go over there, though.
[178:39.10]What is he?
[178:39.38]Can I even do anything over here?
[178:41.56]I'm gonna go up.
[178:59.62]Where's my rope?
[179:02.76]Oh, yeah.
[179:03.94]Oh, I should have hydrated by now.
[179:05.72]I haven't drank water all day.
[179:07.86]Have you really not?
[179:08.50]What's wrong with you?
[179:09.20]Yeah.
[179:09.94]I mean, I had a little.
[179:16.79]Nothing?
[179:17.13]Anything up in here?
[179:20.33]Nothing up in here.
[179:24.61]Um... It's possible that I...
[179:30.76]got them all I think if we also have all stone you can you can craft them I mean there's probably some somewhere but like if you went to a different world and it got down to hell really quickly you'd find them immediately is all I'm saying a lot of cool things in here if we just like went to our own separate servers and like didn't play together uh well there's definitely nothing else here heart statue does that do anything
[179:59.65]Just do things, but no, just ignore him.
[180:13.00]Anybody see anything?
[180:13.90]I don't see anything.
[180:49.79]alright alright nothing but there are some magma blocks up here that I'm gonna get like I was just saying if you're desperate just mine health stone
[181:02.57]if you really can't find any.
[181:04.45]And I'm sure I gotta go further over this way.
[181:10.96]I'm sure I'm gonna accidentally summon Plantera.
[181:15.08]Isn't that on you?
[181:15.92]Not on me.
[181:18.04]Yeah.
[181:18.80]What?
[181:19.02]What?
[181:21.17]Plantera down here.
[181:22.79]I said, I swear I'm going to accidentally summon Plantera.
[181:26.07]And then you already got defensive.
[181:31.34]Don't make me laugh.
[181:32.14]Not when there's all lava underneath me.
[181:35.18]It wasn't a joke.
[181:36.04]It was like the court recording of what happened.
[181:53.67]this uh magma turtle worth anything worth it to a zoo I have no idea what do they look like you'll you'll know when you see it it really is like a heart with a face I know I know right I I'm just being an idiot okay what do they look like
[182:29.65]I can't mine this?
[182:34.61]Get out of the way!
[182:45.26]I don't even know why I'm mining chlorophyte because I don't think any of us are going to use it.
[183:04.87]Mmm, I don't see any others.
[183:06.25]These are really helpful though, just to like, peruse an area.
[183:29.37]Okay, let's go up.
[183:33.57]I'm thinking up.
[183:34.86]Yeah.
[183:39.89]So one heart is 20 health, right?
[183:42.69]Yeah.
[183:43.77]Have you found any?
[183:44.75]I just need one more.
[183:46.61]Okay, I'm at Plantera's Bulb.
[183:50.14]One more will do it.
[183:51.32]Dude, diapers, LOL.
[184:00.78]I'm not saying it.
[184:07.21]Ow!
[184:12.75]Come on, give me another one.
[184:24.23]Found it.
[184:24.59]Got one.
[184:28.07]Okay, teleport to me.
[184:29.54]Hold on, I gotta get it first.
[184:37.52]Blazing Heart.
[184:46.31]Teleport to Yug.
[184:47.09]I need to go back to the base first.
[184:49.73]That's important.
[184:50.49]I also found this weird, like, ribbon candy.
[184:54.95]Storium.
[184:57.59]Storium is... more than the Storium.
[185:10.56]Alright, let's go back.
[185:12.00]Fucking diaper.
[185:18.20]It's this diaper thing.
[185:20.78]It's gonna drive me crazy.
[185:22.12]It's a good joke.
[185:23.71]Alright, so... Permanently increases life by 10.
[185:27.83]I thought you said it gave me 20.
[185:29.67]Oh, I just assumed.
[185:32.49]Well, I need two more apparently.
[185:38.64]Well, we can do that after.
[185:39.46]Or I can do that later.
[185:44.46]And again, you can craft it with Hellstone.
[185:47.89]And we should have the stuff to do that.
[185:50.95]I would look into that before you go on another goose chase.
[185:54.55]Hellstone brick?
[185:55.87]Or Hellstone, like, no, not brick, right?
[185:58.18]Hellstone bars.
[185:58.98]Yeah.
[186:10.97]I thought that was bacon.
[186:19.76]Do you need, uh, Hermes boots or anything?
[186:21.24]I just put them in the storage.
[186:22.60]No.
[186:29.46]Blinkroot seeds?
[186:30.94]Trash?
[186:32.32]Trash.
[186:33.10]What about the Mario hat?
[186:33.96]Auto-trash.
[186:34.50]It actually is a Mario hat.
[186:49.86]1e Restoration Potions.
[186:50.90]That's not bad.
[186:58.22]Alright.
[187:00.04]I am ready to come back to you to do the thing that you want to do here.
[187:06.51]Oh boy, oh boy, do I want to do this thing with you.
[187:09.61]Okay.
[187:11.37]So.
[187:14.33]I'm going to teleport to you once I get a Wormhole Potion.
[187:19.90]Wormhole potion.
[187:24.51]And I am gone.
[187:27.61]Ready?
[187:31.49]Hi.
[187:31.71]I fly up here.
[187:32.39]Need to finish this and we could probably just start it.
[187:42.56]I think we're strong enough.
[187:45.68]Do not have to worry.
[187:50.53]So this thing is scary?
[187:52.13]Uh, a little bit.
[187:55.59]This is our up and down safety net, so kite it up and down rather than across the plank.
[188:01.74]And I need some open space for my bow to even work.
[188:06.42]Click diaper check.
[188:07.18]Ban the word diaper.
[188:07.94]I end this nightmare.
[188:10.00]Ban the word diaper.
[188:12.22]Add diaper to, like, the not show up in the chat list.
[188:14.58]Just do it.
[188:16.18]You better be ready.
[188:16.82]I'm ready.
[188:43.51]It's weird that they always go for you.
[188:47.95]I'm trying to say, oh my god.
[189:01.77]But I got to the O-M part.
[189:09.41]That was really not that hard.
[189:11.99]No, it's falling!
[189:14.80]Omo.
[189:17.34]It's O-no with an M, apparently.
[189:22.48]Temple key.
[189:23.04]What's that?
[189:24.80]Temple is the next thing we have to do.
[189:26.80]That's actually what we should do while we're here.
[189:29.54]If your inventory isn't... Oh, I just got rid of everything.
[189:33.18]Okay.
[189:35.26]Well, then we need to find the entrance to the temple, which is at the bottom right of the jungle, usually.
[189:42.27]okay uh do you get anything else let's see uh energy core honey block bloom weave bud bomb plantera uh boost to item grab range rocket living shard temple key quick grenade launcher this thing is insane I think it uses a grenade ammo oh other than that not really I don't think
[190:15.46]Oh yeah, now Illuminite.
[190:17.08]So we're just going to kind of dig down to stay within this area.
[190:30.50]Yeah, it's like the dungeon, but the bricks are like orange.
[190:42.76]That's it right here.
[190:43.80]Oh, alright.
[190:45.02]But we can't dig through it, so we have to find the actual front door.
[190:47.84]I'm assuming the front door is down.
[191:04.87]Oh, no, it's at the top.
[191:06.13]Top?
[191:07.62]Just keep going to the right.
[191:09.04]I'm mining this stuff.
[191:10.62]I'll be with you.
[191:13.82]Oh, this is it right here.
[191:14.68]The door is in lava.
[191:15.90]Uh, can we do anything about that?
[191:19.16]Uh, you can take a little bit of damage.
[191:23.80]Or if you have a lava immunity charm on you, I don't.
[191:28.15]How do I open the door?
[191:30.67]You're gonna have to dig through the obsidian.
[191:32.37]Walk through the lava.
[191:36.51]Easy.
[191:40.59]Easy!
[191:40.77]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[191:41.95]Let's do this.
[191:50.66]B grenade down.
[191:51.32]Be careful.
[191:51.72]B grenades don't hurt people.
[191:55.38]That's what I was trying to do.
[192:01.80]Don't go down there!
[192:07.05]Don't go down there!
[192:10.33]That's like a really bad construction yard.
[192:15.09]Hey, watch out!
[192:15.75]Don't go over there!
[192:16.31]We're blowing the building tonight.
[192:19.71]Yeah, we're also going to have lunch underneath it.
[192:24.79]Okay, you just need to man up and go open the door.
[192:32.03]Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[192:33.59]What?
[192:33.91]What?
[192:34.85]What's going on?
[192:37.31]What do you mean wait?
[192:37.77]There's traps everywhere.
[192:38.39]There's like the walls are shooting at you right now.
[192:43.41]Okay, just chill, just chill.
[192:49.07]Okay, the enemies down here kind of hurt.
[192:50.61]There's a whole bunch of them.
[192:51.55]There's spikes along the walls.
[192:52.55]I'll get full inventory ammo.
[192:55.21]What?
[192:57.83]Lizard door?
[192:58.79]I don't want a lizard door.
[193:00.12]I'm so mad that I have this.
[193:05.30]You gave it to me.
[193:06.56]I'm just getting rid of all this shit.
[193:07.96]Fuck this stuff.
[193:14.09]What?
[193:14.95]Oh, what's going on here?
[193:16.51]What?
[193:17.55]Okay.
[193:18.79]The one thing you really need to watch out for down here is there's spikes that shoot... There's dart traps, but also there's these spike things that drop from the ceiling, and they bounce up and down, and they do a lot more damage than it looks like they do.
[193:32.20]Got it.
[193:33.12]We have to get to the bottom.
[193:35.34]And then there's a boss.
[193:37.10]How do the traps activate, though?
[193:39.97]That's the big question for me.
[193:41.01]There's floor pressure traps that are very hard to see.
[193:53.29]You see those faces on the left wall?
[193:55.73]On the right wall.
[193:57.67]These are crap.
[193:59.71]By the way, dude, I just walked over here and my inventory got full again.
[194:04.10]Like, this is insanity.
[194:06.56]This is too... What do we do with this stuff?
[194:17.60]I got...
[194:25.85]I don't know what to do.
[194:27.25]You understand?
[194:28.55]Go back to the base.
[194:29.71]Go back to the base, recall, put your stuff in the storage, then wormhole back to me.
[194:34.47]And then we can stop arguing.
[194:37.44]It's insane.
[194:38.60]It's too many things to have to keep track of.
[194:47.27]One of these things is really, really good, though.
[194:48.91]It was a lot of damage.
[194:56.89]What was it?
[194:57.49]It was in my inventory.
[194:59.09]Magic Dagger.
[195:00.85]Insanely fast attack speed.
[195:16.76]I'm coming.
[195:17.60]Oh god, what did I do?
[195:18.20]I pressed B.
[195:29.28]wins dos after this is it safe to go in here what is it safe to go in here yeah just be very careful I'm just not touching the ground oh see those are the spikes the only thing I'm just standing up here
[196:08.00]Could you describe what was going on right now to somebody that doesn't know what's going on?
[196:14.39]We're inside the lizard temple that has been closed for centuries.
[196:22.63]And we're here to, you know, stop the prophecy.
[196:30.54]As best we can.
[196:32.16]What is this duck quacking song?
[196:34.92]Those are the lizards.
[196:36.94]Oops.
[196:42.07]Also, they drop a very specific item.
[196:44.71]Oh, no, there's chests down here that we need.
[196:46.61]They usually have the thing in it.
[196:51.83]I can't open this.
[196:52.35]It's because you're using it.
[196:53.91]I'm already in it.
[196:55.19]I don't have any space.
[196:56.23]Open that chest.
[196:58.23]And top left, there's a power fragment, which is what we need to fight the boss.
[197:07.00]Okay.
[197:10.12]Power fragment.
[197:14.44]This lizard power cell?
[197:16.62]Yeah.
[197:21.26]I'm gonna make a fortified arrows, I think.
[197:39.61]We have a lot of that stuff.
[197:45.59]Now he doesn't look at chat anymore.
[197:46.83]Alright, I'm gonna be real.
[197:50.01]The last probably 25 times I looked at chat, there was probably eight messages saying, like, look at his diaper.
[197:59.72]There was like a diaper comment.
[198:03.84]What can you say?
[198:04.56]Your chat loves diapers.
[198:06.12]You should do like a sponsored deal with like a diaper company.
[198:11.93]So what are we doing with that altar over there?
[198:14.37]We are clearing the room of traps first.
[198:18.61]So just activate all the traps.
[198:20.77]No, you have to actually pickaxe and destroy them off the wall.
[198:23.85]Oh.
[198:26.69]Don't worry.
[198:28.30]Just wait.
[198:28.92]I'm doing it.
[198:29.78]I'll do it.
[198:31.56]I can do it.
[198:55.30]Oh, look out!
[198:56.08]A spider!
[198:57.94]Okay.
[198:59.64]So, uh... This one... You want the explanation, or do you want to be surprised?
[199:09.23]Um... Go ahead and... What should I be aware of?
[199:14.25]It's a big rock man that basically jumps up into the air and tries to land on you.
[199:18.96]The first phase is fairly self-explanatory.
[199:22.16]Don't get jumped on.
[199:23.24]And then the golem's head pops off and flies around and shoots at you.
[199:26.52]Okay, I'm ready.
[199:28.56]Okay, you need to go use the solar fragment on that altar.
[199:32.63]Or the power spell.
[199:35.93]Oh, Jesus.
[199:37.65]Well, he was just going to land here.
[199:50.13]This is the Mario 64 guy Okay, and once we destroy this his head pops off in his face My weapon is pretty terrible for this
[200:23.84]I'm gonna die.
[200:25.08]Don't die!
[200:29.21]So what should we be targeting here?
[200:30.30]Like, what should we be focusing on?
[200:51.49]No, no, no, no.
[200:52.85]I touched a trap.
[200:55.24]We both died in the same place.
[200:57.86]All my fucking things are hitting the ceiling.
[200:59.90]I'm doing half the time nothing.
[201:02.42]Like, if I dodge, then I can't hit him.
[201:04.08]It's kind of annoying.
[201:08.45]Well, I'm going to make, like, a hollow bar.
[201:11.97]Oh, well.
[201:24.87]Oh well.
[201:27.93]Oh well.
[201:32.34]We tried.
[201:32.70]Oh well, we tried.
[201:37.84]Uh, this thing looks kind of ridiculous.
[201:39.70]Demonic Spearmint.
[201:44.21]89 melee damage.
[201:45.79]Attacks apply a stacking poison.
[201:48.63]You should take a look at this.
[201:56.80]Yeah, it's really good.
[202:00.42]But nobody's a melee boy.
[202:06.76]Did you say you wanted this, this chlorophyte stuff?
[202:08.86]Bullet, chlorophyte, bullet, chlorophyte.
[202:10.40]Uh, chlorophyte arrows.
[202:19.50]Fake coin.
[202:25.80]Solar Pebble.
[202:26.38]I think it makes decent stuff.
[202:33.55]I forget.
[202:34.23]You'd have to look.
[202:37.25]It either makes decent stuff or it makes nothing.
[202:40.13]What about a Dual Hook?
[202:43.58]Garbage.
[202:44.10]Here, take this new Pickaxe.
[202:48.00]New Pickaxe.
[202:48.94]Pickaxe Axe.
[202:49.78]Kind of redundant.
[202:51.00]Redundant.
[202:54.20]So is this a pickaxe?
[202:54.91]We never made you that armor either, did we?
[202:56.97]It's both.
[202:57.83]Oh, okay.
[202:58.37]So I can just get rid of this other one.
[203:03.79]No, I still have the same armor that I had from a while ago.
[203:09.30]That's pretty good.
[203:11.38]We can go kill spiders.
[203:14.48]I want to go grab my gold.
[203:15.48]I dropped like 50 gold.
[203:18.06]We need that power self, right?
[203:19.77]So I should keep it.
[203:21.81]Yeah, it's easy to get a few more there.
[203:23.45]Oh, okay.
[203:23.91]They all drop it.
[203:27.30]How are we doing on potions?
[203:28.18]Let me see what else do I want.
[203:30.72]Summoning potion, mana regen potion, regen potion.
[203:33.32]Yeah, give me more of these.
[203:39.88]Why don't you fuck off?
[203:44.55]Summon your dudes.
[203:46.25]Are they not here?
[203:48.65]Yeah, you died.
[203:49.77]Oh, right.
[203:57.03]Endurance.
[204:01.64]Get this mask.
[204:02.40]Five of these.

[205:00.54]Titan.
[205:02.08]Thorns.
[205:02.66]Alright.
[205:03.08]I believe I am ready to do this.
[205:10.79]Again.
[205:35.15]Alright, are you ready to do this again?
[205:40.50]You can start going there and I'll be able to teleport on you.
[205:43.10]I have a few things to do.
[205:45.22]Okay.
[205:47.96]So we need to go down, we gotta go left.
[205:51.05]So I'm just gonna start flying.
[205:59.07]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[206:00.05]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[206:00.83]What is it?
[206:03.01]Did you get living shards from Santera?
[206:06.13]Uh, I think they're in the... Yeah, they're in the, um... They should be in the box.
[206:26.71]Alright, let's move a little bit further.
[206:42.13]So.
[206:44.93]Just down, down, down, down, down, down.
[206:47.73]Okay.

[207:20.31]Palladium.
[207:21.09]I'll take it.
[207:22.11]Holy shit, this mine's fast.
[207:24.53]Yeah.
[207:25.40]Oh my goodness.
[207:26.24]Is this like the end of the... Is this late game?
[207:29.70]There's still some more pickaxes.
[207:31.00]How is that even possible?
[207:34.92]It gets wild.
[207:35.62]There's like rideable drills that you can just like fuck and destroy the whole world with.
[207:41.89]What the fuck is going on in this chat room?
[207:45.92]What are you guys doing?
[207:47.56]There's people panicking in here.
[207:50.84]Can't you guys just relax?
[207:57.10]Oh shit.
[208:06.37]Queen bee!
[208:07.85]Queen bee!
[208:09.03]Queen bee!
[208:10.69]We'll need honeycomb.
[208:21.85]You'll get it.
[208:25.25]Never honeycomb.
[208:28.97]Oh, Terraria.
[208:29.59]Yeah, we're just kind of hanging out playing Terraria.
[208:32.58]I'm kind of getting like a little bored though in chat.
[208:36.48]Oh, I know.
[208:37.62]I'll just start spamming diaper fuck OWO.
[208:41.68]That sounds like a plant.
[208:47.68]Way to go, man.
[208:50.02]Shout out to all the diaper fucks.
[209:10.40]Is it over here?
[209:10.86]It is.
[209:20.14]How many people in your chat do you think actually wear diapers?
[209:22.32]Or like people that wear diapers and got offended by this joke and like left mad?
[209:27.00]Zero.
[209:28.82]Zero.
[209:29.81]Absolute 100% zero.
[209:31.17]Oh, okay.
[209:31.81]Well, now that you're a denier, the guy definitely got mad.
[209:35.67]Zero, dude.
[209:36.89]Nobody is here.
[209:37.85]What's so funny about Trevor wearing a diaper when I wear one every day?
[209:40.70]No, I'm trying to like get away from this.
[209:45.18]I'm trying to get us away from this.
[209:56.06]My chat is in emote-only mode because they've lost their minds.
[210:10.02]Dude, how do you... Alright.
[210:11.48]Are we talking politics in the chat too?
[210:13.28]How do we go from, like, diaper talk to let's talk about, like, the current state of, like, the Republican Party?
[210:20.29]Did diapers affect the economy?
[210:24.68]Everything, really.
[210:26.80]The environment?
[210:29.04]Biodegradable diapers?
[210:30.14]Diapers affected it all.
[210:36.59]It gets serious.
[210:38.19]Alright.
[210:38.77]I'm kind of there.
[210:41.53]Just to be clear, we don't need those life crystals, right?
[210:46.61]Life crystals, I don't think so.
[210:47.67]Just the regular, the default ones?
[210:52.80]I don't think so.
[210:55.18]Alright, I've made it.
[210:56.00]Wait, you're there?
[210:56.92]I'm here.
[210:57.90]Yes.
[211:00.08]You're not in the boss room.
[211:03.77]Keep going.
[211:06.01]Well, I didn't say I was in the boss room.
[211:07.29]I said I was, like, here.
[211:10.53]Alright, I'm trying to go, like, too fast.
[211:19.73]I'm getting hurt.
[211:24.99]Put it in self-only mode?
[211:26.45]Yeah, put it in diaper-only mode.
[211:29.55]That's not gonna help.
[211:31.45]Oh my god, it's your fault.
[211:33.71]I don't get what the big deal is.
[211:53.12]You know?
[211:53.84]Okay, I gotta sit here for a second.
[211:55.00]I'm gonna die.
[212:00.61]You can get one more heart crystal.
[212:04.79]Uh, I think I need to- they need the blazing hearts though, don't they?
[212:07.83]They do.
[212:08.49]Fucking inventory's full.
[212:10.85]Oh, I have another life root!
[212:15.66]My god.
[212:28.36]Wait, did you die?
[212:29.36]No.
[212:29.82]Every banner I'm throwing in the trash.
[212:32.12]I never want to pick a banner up ever again.
[212:40.69]That's kind of a... Green dragon skill.
[212:43.07]Yeah, keep those.
[212:47.06]Inept bloodfeaster.
[212:48.72]I don't want this annoying blood drinker.
[212:50.98]I don't want a superior bloodfeaster.
[212:53.02]That looks pretty good, but it's not good enough.
[212:57.56]I'm leaving a trap for you, because you're going to run down here and touch it all.
[213:04.73]Here's my item trap that you're going to get full because it's here.
[213:08.23]Well, I'm just going to teleport to you and skip the trap.
[213:15.86]That's true.
[213:20.68]Okay, I am pretty much there.
[213:22.34]I'm there.
[213:25.95]Are you there or are you pretty much there?
[213:27.37]I mean, I'm literally standing right outside at the front door, yeah, here.
[213:30.43]Alright, don't, let's not, I don't want to summon this yet because I want to make sure I take my potions and I have full health.
[213:41.90]Okay.
[213:47.11]Okay, let me do that.
[213:55.81]Okay, hold on.
[214:00.51]Let's get that full HP.
[214:04.89]Okay.
[214:10.80]Okay.
[214:11.62]You created us.
[214:12.50]This is because... I didn't create you guys!
[214:14.38]Okay.
[214:19.82]Star, what do you do when your chat gets bored and they start crying?
[214:23.56]My chat is always bored.
[214:26.94]That's the trick.

[217:22.06]Is that what that is?
[217:23.46]Yeah.

[220:43.98]I wish I could tell you.
[220:45.22]It was... It was... This alien landed the spaceship behind us.
[220:50.36]That actually... I like knocked out the alien.
[221:00.50]Missed the ad, yeah.
[221:02.39]There was an ad.
[221:03.33]There was like a Samsung Galaxy ad.
[221:15.24]Alright, I'm pretty much ready to do whatever.
[221:20.73]I've got my friends.
[221:24.39]Are you, though?
[221:29.18]Yeah.
[221:32.68]I've got both keys.
[221:33.72]I'm ready to open some boxes.
[221:36.18]On camera.
[221:38.66]Uh, start walkin'.
[221:41.12]Back to the temple place where we just were?
[221:43.11]No, to the right, to the dungeon.
[221:44.75]Ooh, the dungeon.
[221:46.05]I know what that is.
[221:48.19]I've been there a few times.
[221:56.44]Yes!
[222:20.58]Okay, I've made it to the chest piece.
[222:24.88]Dungeon is over here.
[222:31.85]This is kind of epic.
[222:32.87]Thanks, man.
[222:49.19]If my game's lagging, I hear the noise and then it does it.
[222:54.03]That's funny.
[222:55.53]Lag.
[222:56.83]Lag is funny.
[223:05.80]What is... Whoa!
[223:07.40]What's going on in here?
[223:09.16]The dungeon has, like, new people here.
[223:10.62]Oh, yeah, because it's hard mode.
[223:13.47]Oh.
[223:18.94]There's a big glow- there's like a big coin.
[223:22.06]Ah, there's a- there's a lun- Oh, you fucking activated the Lunatic Cultist.
[223:25.38]I don't know what that means!
[223:26.82]What does that mean?
[223:28.02]I don't know what you're talking about.
[223:33.76]Do you understand?
[223:35.13]I forgot that you wouldn't know and you would go there and you would just kill them because you think it's Diablo 3.
[223:44.93]Well, I'm still alive.
[223:54.18]Uh, good luck.
[223:55.30]I'm busy.
[224:02.90]What happens if I despawn him?
[224:05.24]I don't know.
[224:09.75]Actually, also, I don't even think we want to kill him.
[224:13.79]Because when you kill him, the pillars spawn, and it turns your game into a fucking nightmare.
[224:18.77]Is he still on me?
[224:20.43]No, he's not.
[224:21.11]Is he?
[224:22.29]No.
[224:22.53]Okay, zero.
[224:30.97]Um, we're going to have to find another way to get into the dungeon.
[224:33.35]Because he isn't going to be standing there.
[224:36.17]You just walk by him.
[224:38.48]You just walk by him.
[224:39.46]If you don't kill them all, you just walk by them.
[224:47.18]But I have guides that just attack.
[224:49.94]I can't stop them.
[224:51.93]You can unsummon them.
[224:52.83]I guess you're right.
[224:56.73]I guess you're right.
[224:58.77]Yeah, I think so.
[224:59.85]That was a snail.
[225:08.41]No, it's not.
[225:15.86]Earth Elemental.
[225:16.92]Okay.
[225:18.40]That was me.
[225:28.57]There's nothing here anymore.
[225:29.33]Alright, I'm in the dungeon.
[225:30.61]Okay, I'll be there in one second.
[225:33.05]I'm making myself armor.
[225:44.17]armor how far down just all go all the way down uh you're just looking for that specific chest that hopefully doesn't crash in multiplayer oh it's that chest it's like the blue one no it's not that blue one there's a lot of different types of chests down there is it will I know it when I see it is it big what is it I I don't know what it looks like oh okay
[226:14.56]Don't touch the blue ones.
[226:15.70]People are freaking out.
[226:16.38]Don't touch, do not touch the blue ones.
[226:18.84]Yeah, we did that already.
[226:20.50]We already did that accident one.
[226:21.96]It's alright.
[226:27.47]It looks like the key.
[226:31.89]So it looks, it's kind of like a claw.
[226:35.84]A monster hand or something like purple and yellow.
[226:43.52]Um, what the fuck was that, and why did it... Alright, looking around, trying to find it.
[227:02.52]You'll know it when you see it, alright.
[227:06.00]There's a spawn of boss?
[227:07.36]There's also, like, snake ladies.
[227:11.12]They won't attack you if you don't fight them, and they're a little bit stronger than everybody else.
[227:15.62]You have to remember I have these guys.
[227:17.14]Should I just show?
[227:17.92]I don't want to unsummon them, though.
[227:19.10]They're doing a great job doing killing stuff.
[227:26.05]I think they won't attack me.
[227:31.31]Oh, shit.
[227:31.85]I can make this.
[227:38.91]Wait, I thought I had a panic necklace.
[227:41.08]No, I don't.
[227:42.58]I can almost make it.
[227:45.22]Is that it?
[227:47.38]That's it?
[227:54.00]No?
[227:55.70]What's that icon?
[227:57.96]That's a weird icon here.
[228:00.78]Should I not touch this one?
[228:08.43]Wrong one.
[228:10.05]That's a different key.
[228:10.99]Oh, okay.
[228:12.01]So the key will pop up like that.
[228:15.22]I think I found the snake lady.
[228:18.08]So don't attack the snake lady, you said?
[228:21.68]You don't have to.
[228:22.38]I mean, you can.
[228:23.40]But she's a bit stronger.
[228:25.44]Okay.
[228:25.70]I'm going to take that as a do not.
[228:33.19]It's going to be hard because there's all these idiots in this room.
[228:35.79]Alright.
[228:36.81]Don't attack...
[228:42.59]Oh, fuck, dude.
[228:44.49]How do you... Hey, chat, how do you create a crimson biome in this world?
[228:49.13]So I, like, don't have to leave.
[228:51.11]That's how you get panic heart.
[229:08.18]Ow!
[229:08.44]I'm just getting juggled right here.
[229:14.31]Oh, fuck.
[229:14.79]I'm gonna die.
[229:15.27]I'm dead.
[229:15.75]I'm gonna die.
[229:17.33]I'm dead.
[229:18.29]I'm dead.
[229:20.93]Are you?
[229:21.39]No.
[229:22.59]I will be in a second.
[229:23.33]Give me, like, one second.
[229:24.70]I'm making, like, a super necklace.
[229:34.72]I have no... My healing potions are on cooldown.
[230:32.75]I literally just clicked on you to teleport to you.
[230:37.69]As you died.
[230:41.15]Literally.
[230:42.27]I fucking, like, I had like zero health and I went down and I was trying to use that thing as light and I aggroed one of the fucking snake ladies.
[230:55.18]With like five hearts.
[230:58.80]I told you not to aggro the snake ladies.
[231:00.66]I couldn't help it.
[231:01.58]I was trying to see where I was going.
[231:02.96]God damn it.
[231:03.84]I was quite clear about the snake ladies.
[231:05.97]Yeah, and she was off screen and I was going like this to see where I was going so I could get quick.
[231:15.67]What the hell?
[231:17.87]What the hecky?
[231:19.63]I almost had it too.
[231:29.36]I was moving around pretty good, too, until she threw frozen orb at me.
[231:35.36]And it filled the whole hallway I was in, and it did, like, six hearts.
[231:40.17]Hey, you by chance didn't see, um, you know, on your way over there.
[231:44.45]Wait, why are you going that way?
[231:47.05]I'm just looking for one place real fast.
[231:51.10]Uh, where there is, like, crystals in the background and aliens.
[231:55.38]Crystals and aliens?
[231:56.50]I have no idea what you mean.
[232:04.04]Why can I not use this?
[232:08.04]It's near the dungeon, I guess.
[232:14.24]Who the fuck is Plaguebringer?
[232:16.40]Oh, it's nothing.
[232:17.16]I got him.
[232:21.25]I don't know what any of this stuff is really used for.
[232:29.97]Stardust?
[232:30.65]I feel like that's going to be useful at some point.
[232:36.14]What about this Ectoplasm, Ecto-Blood, or anything?
[232:46.11]I'm just gonna say, sure.
[232:53.83]Tally Counter?
[232:55.69]Who cares.
[233:03.02]I'm so disappointed right now.
[233:04.51]I really was, like, doing just fine.
[233:15.91]I still... I have greater... I need, like, greater healing potions.
[233:19.50]Where do you get those?
[233:21.32]Uh, you don't start getting them until after... Oh, okay.
[233:24.00]So I'm not supposed to have them.
[233:26.46]No.
[233:26.68]The ones that heal 200... The max I think we have right now is 150.
[233:34.64]Unless there's crafting that can be done, or Potion Seller sells them.
[233:37.32]I don't think he does.
[233:37.94]I remember that place.
[233:53.83]What the hell?
[233:57.45]Oh, never mind.
[233:58.25]Alright, I don't want to use the unicorn, because I can't just fly and go like this.
[234:12.03]welcome hello somebody said I should buy the tiki armor is that worth it uh I don't know what it does there's a lot of items you need to get the freaking it's worth it for you to get the uh spider armor
[234:34.85]just do a zerg potion in this oh this is it this is the thing you walked through it you didn't even say anything yeah I did I said you didn't hear me just say I walked over it apparently I was I said I was I walked over it no I didn't I was talking to my chat I need better I need 25 stardust now all these enemies drop time for a zerg potion

[235:07.31]Yeah.

[235:10.49]I picked up a bunch of it.
[235:14.41]Yeah.
[235:15.75]There's 10.
[235:17.05]How much do you need?
[235:17.69]Every time I've gotten more than 10 or 20, you're like, whoa, you got way too many.
[235:26.37]How many do you need?
[235:28.85]I need 1,000.
[235:29.13]Have fun farming that.
[235:33.36]I don't need very many.
[235:34.12]I need 25.
[235:38.23]Whatever you're holding right now is probably not.
[235:40.78]It is two.
[235:44.28]I put like ten in the box and I just did it.
[235:46.80]I just said I got ten from the box.
[235:49.06]Why are you laughing?
[235:50.88]I'm not laughing.
[235:51.98]Yes, you did.
[235:52.40]I said two and you went... You did a laugh stifle.
[235:57.71]Well, because you'd been here the whole time.
[235:59.61]I thought you had more.
[236:00.79]Two just is like... I just got here.
[236:03.09]I flew back over here.
[236:04.29]Remember I died?
[236:04.93]Go to the dungeon.
[236:05.87]Go die in the dungeon again.
[236:12.34]Oh, what are these guys?
[236:13.29]Cultists!
[236:15.77]No, don't kill them, though.
[236:16.59]For real.
[236:16.89]Like, don't actually do that.
[236:26.15]Alright, this time, I'm gonna be ready.
[236:29.29]This time, it's gonna be a different story.
[236:32.71]I'm ready.
[236:33.82]I'm gonna go down, and I'm gonna find it.
[236:36.20]I'm gonna make sure I'm smart about it.
[236:37.60]Do not... I'm not gonna use that thing for light because of the...
[236:43.36]the potential for disaster with the... I was gonna say Molasses Lady, but it's Medusa Lady.
[236:55.73]Making my way over here.
[237:04.02]Not a big deal.
[237:05.94]Everything's fine.
[237:08.12]We're gonna head this way.
[237:10.74]I'm gonna check it out over there Ain't nothing in there Not a big deal Not a big deal, yeah
[237:41.58]I can't see, though.
[237:47.40]Hi.
[237:49.32]Hello.
[237:52.63]What was that sound?
[237:55.93]My bow is weird.
[237:58.55]Bye, axe.
[237:59.73]Alright.
[238:04.93]Maybe I'll just get out of my way.
[238:16.34]Ow.
[238:21.92]Ooh.
[238:23.90]So, it looks like... What does it look like?
[238:26.72]I'm pretty sure we'll know it if we see it.
[238:30.42]Apparently, you can hover over it and determine what goes in that thing, right?
[238:35.90]So we don't want to go that way.
[238:36.70]Well, that's where I died, over there.
[238:40.16]Yeah, I died over there.
[238:48.50]These necromancers, too, are awful.
[238:53.12]They really bother me.
[238:58.49]Am I, like, have a slow debuff or something?
[239:00.59]Why would you ever have that in a video game?
[239:02.25]Like, why have a slow debuff in any video game?
[239:04.97]I don't know.
[239:06.73]I'm sorry that it makes you angry.
[239:22.81]Okay.
[239:23.99]No, nothing over there.
[239:28.03]Oh, I'm like dying.
[239:29.57]I know, this place sucks!
[239:34.50]Oh yeah, actually also these ectoplasms and stuff, I have been picking her up.
[239:38.78]Yeah.
[239:40.99]They do things.
[239:42.67]As well as the night alloys from Paladins.
[239:48.79]These guys hurt so much.
[239:52.55]I need a second.
[239:53.91]Is there a faster way to regen?
[239:55.37]I should just use my potions.
[239:59.99]A regen potion?
[240:01.19]Bacon?
[240:02.55]That kind of stuff.
[240:06.76]There's a lot of hearts in there.
[240:17.45]Remember, we can just drill through their walls now in this place.
[240:33.14]Also, you seriously are getting hurt as badly as you're getting hurt because you have really old armor.
[240:38.63]You really need to... Really, yeah.
[240:43.69]Well, I'm just going to buy the tiki armor.
[240:45.11]Everyone's saying, tiki, tiki, tiki, and I'm like, alright.
[240:51.54]Don't open that one.
[241:02.20]Not that one.
[241:02.94]It's not this one?
[241:03.38]Oh, no, it's not.
[241:04.40]No.
[241:20.81]Careful.
[241:21.13]I'm being careful, mom.
[241:23.59]This is not a joke anymore.
[241:24.77]This is hard.
[241:31.66]Have you found any, uh, gold keys?
[241:35.06]Uh, I have hallowed key, corruption key, and... No.
[241:40.56]No gold keys.
[241:41.81]Okay, so I should pop a...
[241:44.86]a third potion down here, right?
[241:48.82]I don't think you should do that, but, you know, it's on you.
[241:56.97]There is a gold chest over there.
[242:02.81]Another one of these.
[242:03.57]Wait.
[242:04.99]What is that?
[242:08.13]Hollowed key?
[242:10.07]Is it a hollowed chest?
[242:13.94]Got it!
[242:17.79]Come to me.
[242:18.19]I'm killing an Eidolon, hold on.
[242:22.14]Is this it?
[242:35.39]That's it.
[242:36.37]Oh, I'll open it.
[242:37.77]What the fuck is even hitting us?
[242:40.07]There's a dark trap on the floor.
[242:41.25]Big booty.
[242:43.19]There's a rainbow gun and a bone welder.
[242:47.67]Is that good?
[242:48.60]I've never opened one of these.
[242:51.94]Paladin or... I'm fucking taking my potions.
[242:58.42]I want, like, a mana regen and shit.
[242:59.78]I got a million of them.
[243:01.84]Help.
[243:02.84]Oh, what have you done?
[243:04.06]What have you done?
[243:06.83]You just ran in here!
[243:07.75]I just flew... She's flying up here!
[243:14.37]Get out of here, lady!
[243:16.21]I'm so glad I took those potions.
[243:20.56]Let me see the items.
[243:23.82]Wait a second!
[243:26.20]You and I both have, like, one health.
[243:27.90]Can I see what you picked up?
[243:29.88]What's hitting me?
[243:31.19]I don't know.
[243:31.77]I'm scared.
[243:32.25]You're on fire.
[243:33.61]You're gonna die.
[243:34.23]I'm not on fire.
[243:34.91]How am I on fire?
[243:36.91]What?!
[243:37.15]I think you were poisoned, actually.
[243:46.12]Oh, it was poison.
[243:48.90]Well, here's a rainbow gun.
[243:55.06]And a bone welder used for special crafting.
[243:59.70]Oh, a bone welder's dumb.
[244:01.87]It's dumb.
[244:03.59]Yeah.
[244:05.41]Oh.
[244:06.77]This thing just stays in place.
[244:07.99]That's pretty good.
[244:10.11]How many can be out at once?
[244:10.93]One or more than one?
[244:11.87]I don't know.
[244:12.47]I can only make one.
[244:13.89]Can I do it twice?
[244:21.65]Well, yeah, that's still really good to just shoot once.
[244:23.45]I'll take it if you don't want to use it.
[244:26.17]I'll just fire it once and go back to what I was doing.
[244:28.83]It is magic damage, technically, right?
[244:31.55]What can you turn it into?
[244:32.88]Hold on.
[244:34.46]I want to see what it can be crafted into.
[244:39.74]Cosmic Rainbow.
[244:42.52]Barrage of Rainbows.
[244:43.96]You need Meld Bar, Core of Calamity, and 5 Bars of Life.
[244:54.42]You can do that right before the final boss.
[244:59.33]Cool.
[244:59.85]I just got the achievement.
[245:08.12]I guess you can just fire that once and whatever.
[245:10.22]You take it.
[245:10.92]You can use it.
[245:18.27]What the hell else is here?
[245:19.28]You sounded disgusted when you said that.
[245:21.78]Blue brick.
[245:23.34]Did I do something wrong?
[245:24.16]Alright, the ecto-blood and the ecto-plasma.
[245:26.12]I've been picking it up and putting it in here.
[245:28.00]You said we needed it, right?
[245:30.88]Uh, yeah.
[245:40.03]Uh, because that makes specter bars.
[245:42.29]Dark matter.
[245:43.03]Wait, wait, chat, chat.
[245:49.31]Does Specter Bars make a summoning armor for Jerma?
[245:55.05]How do I do that emote?
[246:01.50]Makes magic?
[246:02.46]Oh.
[246:04.34]He's right there.
[246:07.34]He's going.
[246:07.95]He's going for it.
[246:10.61]He's doing it faster than you guys are.
[246:12.07]Sorry.
[246:25.17]Hold on, this is important.
[246:29.87]Alright.
[246:32.03]Whatever, you can hold on to it.
[246:34.01]Dark steel core.
[246:34.93]I feel like this stuff might be good for somebody, someone, somewhere.
[246:39.09]You said bone welder sucks.
[246:44.94]uh we already have one we already have no we don't it's just you can make like doors out of bones that's all it is and actually yeah we do have one right here I'm pretty sure is that it Jerma get figure out this tiki armor or go get the fucking spider shit okay tiki armor who sells it who sells the tiki armor
[247:14.98]tiki guy I know where a spider area is we can just go do it no no no I want the tiki okay they're they're in it's the witch doctor in the jungle you have to build a house in the jungle to get them no we have the witch doctor

[247:38.14]He's in the reject housing.
[247:43.88]Where is that?
[247:44.60]Right here?
[247:46.32]Yeah.
[247:49.96]Okay, I think I found it.
[247:59.83]Uh, imbuing station?
[248:04.88]Mantis came.
[248:06.80]He only sells this shit if he's living in the jungle.
[248:11.12]How do we move this guy in the jungle?
[248:13.14]You have to build a house in the jungle, and then there's a button that can tell you who to tell someone to live there.
[248:19.16]Okay.
[248:20.16]So I just gotta make a square in the jungle with a door, and then say, I want this guy over here.
[248:26.46]Yeah, let me figure out the recipe for the instant house.
[248:36.04]Um... Why do I not have this?
[248:39.04]Scary Mask.
[248:41.30]Increases your minion size by 150%.
[248:42.60]And 10% more minion damage.
[248:51.15]Well, get it.
[248:52.13]Why didn't you have it?
[248:53.21]It's 90 gold.
[248:54.07]Alright, I'm gonna get this.
[249:01.85]Why didn't you have it?
[249:05.45]I didn't even know it existed.
[249:06.51]That's not an excuse.
[249:12.75]I think it is, actually.
[249:13.61]OK, where's that gold?
[249:17.54]There we go.
[249:18.94]I'll take a hundred of it.
[249:20.22]No, more than that.
[249:21.38]I'll take a hundred.
[249:22.32]It's fine.
[249:26.42]You only need the pygmy staff in your inventory.
[249:29.92]They have people saying, don't listen to chat.
[249:31.34]They're wrong.
[249:33.16]Do we have a pygmy staff?
[249:35.90]I haven't even seen one.
[249:38.76]I mean, if I found one, I would have destroyed it.
[249:40.48]1% fucking melee speed, really?
[249:45.32]I have to go re-roll this.
[249:52.86]Bewitching table?
[249:53.72]We already have one of these, right?
[249:58.63]We can fight Plantera again to get it.
[250:01.21]I can get the Portable.
[250:02.03]Oh, shit.
[250:02.35]This isn't what I thought it was.
[250:04.69]Summons Plantera.
[250:05.57]Do you want to fight Plantera again?
[250:07.09]I mean, we can do that.
[250:10.20]Yeah.
[250:10.36]Should I just buy this?
[250:10.90]You have to find a bulb, though.
[250:11.86]It's right here.
[250:12.32]It's 20 gold.
[250:13.18]Portable.
[250:14.64]Oh, okay.
[250:15.52]Do you want to fight Plantera?
[250:17.08]I mean, if all I need is this... If Plantera drops the Pygmy Staff, that's all I need to go and buy it.
[250:24.71]Whatever he has.
[250:26.69]Hold on.
[250:30.26]I don't think this is... This is not a Jubeid.
[250:31.92]I don't think they would do this to me right now.
[250:35.34]Where's the guy that rerolls?
[250:36.26]There.
[250:41.34]Yeah.
[250:41.94]You need the pygmy staff.
[250:44.30]That's so much money to reroll this.
[250:46.74]It costs 1 platinum and 50 gold to buy the armor set.
[250:55.19]Is this...
[250:59.03]I know sometimes it's an accessory, but it's a mask.
[251:05.38]It's actually an accessory.
[251:07.40]So I'm going to have to remove the fearmonger.
[251:19.19]Alright.
[251:19.49]10% minion damage, minion size.
[251:20.55]Let's see how big they are now.
[251:23.38]Oh my god.
[251:25.20]This is going to be obnoxious.
[251:28.04]You're not going to want to need to... You're going to have hate standing near me.
[251:36.68]Okay, yeah.
[251:37.20]So 25% chance to drop from Plantar.
[251:38.82]Look at how big these are.
[251:44.37]There's a summon later that you can get after the cultists and you do some other stuff.
[251:50.67]That every time you summon, it adds to the length of a dragon.
[251:53.77]So it's just one big long dragon depending on how many summons you have.
[251:59.36]What did I just do?
[251:59.74]It would look pretty funny that big.
[252:03.46]What did I just do?
[252:05.46]What did you just do?
[252:06.18]I don't know.
[252:09.22]I deleted a hundred fucking coins somehow.
[252:14.12]That's pretty good.
[252:14.68]How's that possible?
[252:15.65]What just happened?
[252:21.65]Can you do it again?
[252:22.25]Can you show me how you do it?
[252:23.79]Well, I think I just... Oh, I made a platinum coin.
[252:30.35]Oh.
[252:30.79]Yeah, the platinum's 100 gold.
[252:32.24]Oh.
[252:32.36]Okay, they just, like, kind of scared the shit out of me.
[252:34.42]Alright, I'm gonna buy the thing.
[252:38.04]Don't throw it in the trash!
[252:46.15]Okay.
[252:47.47]Where should we fight this, then?
[252:50.97]Can I summon it anywhere?
[252:53.64]Just try and do it here.
[252:55.00]I think we have to be in the jungle to fight Plantaire.
[252:58.92]Yeah.
[253:03.65]so probably also bring more than one that doesn't say that it just says pour the bulb doesn't say anything about needing to be anywhere yeah but I'm pretty sure you do like I mean are you just gonna trust me or are you just gonna keep like why don't we just fight it up here okay summon it here Jerma is that oh don't do that everyone's losing it no Jerma do it summon it like click it and see how it works um no no no I've been told what's gonna happen so
[253:37.34]It enrages outside the jungle.
[253:45.58]Okay.
[253:46.70]That's good to know, thanks guys.
[253:50.11]Cool.
[253:50.21]Appreciate that.
[253:50.75]I don't want this fucking thing.
[253:57.47]Alright.
[254:00.71]So, how much money do I have?
[254:02.41]I don't have any money, that's good.
[254:03.83]Touch the summon table.
[254:07.03]And make sure I get everybody out.
[254:08.51]And let's go to the jungle.
[254:11.51]Which is over here.
[254:14.85]I'm on my way!
[254:25.65]We are your bad conscience.
[254:37.01]So is this technically the jungle, like, in here?
[254:39.26]This is the jungle, right?
[254:41.74]Like, right here?
[254:43.80]No.
[254:44.68]No, not where I'm standing currently, but, like, over here.
[254:51.26]No.
[254:52.96]No.
[254:53.28]That's actually the third time you've asked that while standing in that spot.
[254:58.38]Sorry.
[254:59.49]Sorry.
[254:59.85]I was just trying to be clear.
[255:01.95]Who's this?
[255:03.69]It's just some guy.
[255:05.22]There's some guy that wants to just come and fight me.
[255:08.96]It looks like one of the bees.
[255:21.43]What'd he drop?
[255:23.15]Nothing.
[255:25.27]Actually nothing.
[255:26.99]He drops plague canisters, that's it.
[255:29.19]And I think they're for crafting nothing.
[255:31.21]Alright.
[255:40.17]So you want to just fight where we fought when Tara last time?
[255:45.76]Yeah Didn't we fight down here?
[255:51.20]Yeah, I don't know these idiots is over here now
[256:12.23]Plague canister.
[256:19.47]Here's an actual planterra bulb.
[256:22.77]So we can do this twice.
[256:28.92]Yeah.
[256:29.04]What the fuck out of here?
[256:30.36]This is the third one.
[256:35.34]I'm gonna fucking die down here, aren't I?
[256:43.77]You can't die to Plaguebringer.
[256:45.27]You die to Plaguebringer.
[256:47.33]It's over.
[256:51.41]I'm dead.
[256:51.89]I'm going to die to Plaguebringer.
[256:53.16]Because I got hit by poison or some shit.
[256:55.48]I don't even know what it was.
[256:56.38]I'm dead.
[256:57.50]I didn't even die to Plaguebringer.
[256:59.76]I died- I died to the Overwatch Ultimate that's on the screen constantly the whole game.
[257:16.59]it complaining about Overwatch transcends genres that was free that was for your chat I'm dead yeah you're dead too yep I died from full health I had a pressure plate there was an explosive I didn't see it I'm dead
[257:50.22]Bite Plantera at spawn.
[257:52.10]Well, that would be the end of this portion of the stream.
[257:56.48]I need mud.
[257:57.18]Also, I dropped 40 gold there, so.
[258:00.95]You got really mad at me for putting mud in the inventory box.
[258:09.67]Look at this.
[258:10.41]There's mud in here.
[258:13.18]I need mud.
[258:14.40]Don't you wish I was still doing that?
[258:15.64]Do you know how easy it is to get mud?
[258:22.26]You tell me.
[258:34.00]You know what?
[258:34.76]You think you're so tough.
[258:38.21]Summon Plantera in the house and then leave the game.
[258:48.03]And then I'm banned from the server forever.
[258:54.91]That would be such a stupid move.
[258:56.61]No, I'm not going to do that.
[258:57.83]Why is that just... That seems to be, like, the majority general consensus in this chat right now is to do that.
[259:04.15]No, really?
[259:04.78]No.
[259:05.40]I can't wait.
[259:06.80]You know what you must do?
[259:20.44]I'm going back down here.
[259:25.79]Let me guess, we have to fight three more of those undead bees?
[259:34.84]Why you have to be mad?
[259:36.44]Because I am!
[259:37.18]It's only game.
[259:41.74]I am in that spot where we were.
[259:44.32]If you want to come to me, I will be ready to do whatever you want.

[260:31.78]Activate Plantera right now or no balls.
[260:37.15]No.
[260:38.35]I want to get this item.
[260:42.03]I don't want to just cause the game to be a hard game.
[260:48.74]I want to get the staff so I can get the tiki armor so then we can go beat... Oh, here's a bulb.
[260:54.58]Here's a bulb.
[260:56.53]I have one in my inventory already.
[260:59.15]Let's do this one.
[261:00.21]Can you handle doing this without a rope setup?
[261:03.76]I don't know.
[261:04.18]Is it just going to be right here?
[261:05.90]I guess I would just go for it, I guess.
[261:10.82]Let's go.
[261:14.24]That was a no.
[261:15.14]Probably not.
[261:18.54]I'm ready.
[261:31.43]I'm fucking stuck in the goddamn wall.
[261:48.55]Oh, this is bad.

[262:18.88]Alright.
[262:20.46]Well, let me just get my shit together.
[262:22.38]I wish I had the bagpipe.
[262:37.13]Uh, I can summon Flantera again.
[262:38.91]You know what?
[262:40.97]Yeah, I might just have to just sit here.
[262:46.66]Get the band.
[262:47.50]Do I have food up here?
[262:53.70]Oh my god.
[262:54.96]I have apples, but that's it.
[263:08.51]I hate this guy.
[263:09.85]I really do.
[263:10.69]He's not even that hard.
[263:12.81]He's just annoying.
[263:15.96]Did he die?
[263:16.50]Yeah, he's dead.
[263:17.20]I need to regen.
[263:22.46]I even have the regen potion equipped right now.
[263:24.94]I'm eating it.
[263:34.17]Give me the health down here.
[263:37.45]Alright, so... I don't even... I don't even understand.
[263:56.21]Actually, we need to go kill the, uh... And I'm still getting hurt.
[264:09.16]I'm taking, like, times three damage right now.
[264:13.09]And I have to take another potion.
[264:14.01]You are.
[264:16.99]Whose fault is that?
[264:18.03]I just want to fucking regen.
[264:20.53]This thing sucks.
[264:34.00]Make a campfire.
[264:34.88]Do you have any wood?
[264:39.24]Can you make, like, a campfire?
[264:40.15]Yeah, I don't think he's listening to me anymore.
[264:51.64]Oh, sorry, I muted.
[264:52.36]I put a workbench here.
[264:53.18]I was trying to do it, and I don't think I have the things to do it.
[264:55.90]I forget what you actually need.
[264:57.58]Uh, campfire?
[265:00.64]Yeah, I only have you, Wood.
[265:02.34]Alright, thank you for not letting me use that.
[265:04.93]I'm ready.
[265:05.47]I'm gonna summon.
[265:07.99]Ready?
[265:08.25]Do I just have to use the item?
[265:10.17]That's it?
[265:12.53]Just consume it.
[265:13.13]Yeah.
[265:13.77]Yeah.
[265:19.11]Oh yeah, get that thing out here.
[265:25.97]Where's it?
[265:26.41]Oh, it's over there.
[265:50.38]Give me the staff!
[265:54.89]Staff!
[265:58.79]Uh, I don't think so.
[266:06.89]Meh.
[266:08.21]Uh, nimble seedler... No.
[266:11.75]Dammit.
[266:18.35]What's the drop rate on the staff?
[266:20.74]25%.
[266:24.34]You only brought one?
[266:25.11]I mean, they were 20 gold.
[266:27.63]You want me to spend like 100 gold on bulbs?
[266:33.86]Fairly expensive.
[266:43.40]Wasn't there?
[266:43.72]There was one.
[266:44.38]We went by one.
[266:45.10]There was another one here.
[266:46.16]Yeah, we went by one up here, didn't we?
[266:48.32]A little further up this way.
[266:49.30]I remember there being one like up in the beginning.
[266:51.92]Yep, I see it on the map.
[267:01.39]I love Jupiters.
[267:02.53]Me too.
[267:04.39]That's why I have it as an emote.
[267:08.82]There's only one Jupiter.
[267:09.84]How could you love Jupiters?
[267:13.37]You ready?
[267:14.33]Not yet.
[267:14.71]Let me get up there.
[267:17.32]Well, once I summon it, I'm going back down.
[267:19.32]Alright, go ahead and do it.
[267:29.59]Where are they coming from?
[267:31.83]Oh, it's above us.
[267:55.13]Staff!
[267:57.69]Staff!
[268:04.19]Oh, yay!
[268:05.11]You got one?
[268:06.75]Take me, staff.
[268:08.51]Alright, I don't think it actually needs to be in the jungle, so teleport back and go talk to the witch doctor.
[268:13.74]Just to double check.
[268:17.76]If it does, I'll build a house here.
[268:23.68]That's 67 summon damage?
[268:26.68]Summons a pygmy to fight for you.
[268:31.08]Is that good?
[268:31.60]I thought I just re- I could reforge it, right?
[268:34.75]Yeah.
[268:36.13]Alright, let me just go talk to him.
[268:37.19]Let me bring some money too.
[268:39.07]Uh, anybody knew how you, like if there's a reliable way to find your mushroom biome?
[269:05.11]Okay.
[269:06.67]Tiki mask, tiki shirt, tiki pants.
[269:11.69]Axe number of minions, minion damage, and... Oh, okay, this is much better.
[269:17.01]5, 7, and 6.
[269:18.98]6, 17, and 12.
[269:30.16]I mean, this is just so much better.
[269:32.76]And what's the set bonus on this?
[269:35.92]This is expensive.
[269:40.00]Save the painter.
[269:41.61]He's fine.
[269:42.39]Okay.
[269:42.49]So I'm going to buy it all.
[269:54.21]Tiki mask.
[269:56.31]Tiki shirt.
[269:57.99]And I have to come back with more money for the Tiki pants.
[270:00.25]Everyone that lives up here is dead.
[270:01.87]The painter survived.
[270:04.49]Huh?
[270:05.73]Remember when everyone up here died?
[270:06.93]And they're saying to save the painter.
[270:11.53]He's safe down there.
[270:13.15]He's doing just fine.
[270:14.66]Those are all the NPCs we want to be the safest.
[270:19.00]Well, it's actually good that this guy's alive still.
[270:21.12]And by the way, I don't think there's enough money.
[270:23.74]I need ten more gold.
[270:25.48]Can I turn the... Oh, I have gold.
[270:29.15]Wait, can you turn the platinum?
[270:31.07]Oh, okay.
[270:32.29]Thank you.
[270:40.87]Save the painter.
[270:42.35]Save the painter.
[270:47.03]He's gonna be fine.
[270:49.05]Kiki painters.
[270:51.85]Alright, anything else that I could get from this guy?
[270:54.16]No, probably not.
[270:55.34]Alright, I'm gonna go back up and look at all this shit.
[271:09.04]So.
[271:12.00]I'm gonna... Let's go in here.
[271:16.92]Tiki pants.
[271:19.11]Cool.
[271:20.79]Tiki mask.
[271:23.95]Tiki shirt.
[271:27.59]Increases your max number of minions.
[271:29.15]Increases your max number of minions.
[271:32.27]Minion damage, 30%.
[271:35.91]How many can I have now?
[271:37.12]Let's see what it looks like.
[271:43.94]Uh, hold on.
[271:49.14]I, uh, I gotta look.
[271:50.24]I don't, I'll figure it out later.
[271:51.48]Alright.
[272:01.16]Um, I kinda, yeah.
[272:04.12]I'm ready.
[272:06.08]I, um, I think I need normal wood.
[272:11.20]You want to say I'm gonna cut trees down?
[272:15.20]Alright, now let me see that stuff.
[272:20.12]This is 5865.
[272:21.28]If I re-roll this, I can get rid of that junk, but... I'm gonna re-roll the damage, aren't I?
[272:28.43]And you re-roll everything.
[272:31.73]You re-roll everything.
[272:33.81]How much better are the pygmies?
[272:37.45]I've never used it.
[272:38.83]No, no, no, no.
[272:41.34]No, no, no.
[272:43.98]No, no.
[272:48.34]I mean, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[273:02.63]Eight, nine, ten.
[273:05.16]I can have ten of these.
[273:08.60]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[273:14.00]This is cool.
[273:18.11]Let's go.
[273:18.55]I wanted to use them.
[273:22.78]Look at that.
[273:26.94]I've been doing the ice claspers for so long.
[273:29.82]Let me just play with my lemmings for a while.
[273:32.20]Play with your Pikmin.
[273:33.78]Yeah, I'm going to play with all my Pikmin.
[273:39.16]Yeah, I'm absolutely going to use this.
[273:44.86]We're ready.
[273:48.16]Now that I did that, I'm still going to use this.
[273:52.20]Even though it's only 26 damage, I feel like it's still the best thing I've picked up.
[273:58.98]We have not come across a broken staff, right?
[274:02.38]The hero, broken hero staff.
[274:06.20]I need one of those.
[274:12.01]Broken hero staff.
[274:19.56]Where do you get that?
[274:26.18]I'm going to get like lost in all these people.
[274:29.76]So I need like a way to make it so I can differentiate myself.
[274:32.42]Okay.
[274:32.56]I'm the one with the raincoat on.
[274:35.46]I'll get, I will actually get stuck.
[274:44.68]So show a solar eclipse.
[274:47.76]Can we activate a solar eclipse?
[274:53.64]Star?
[274:55.80]Sorry, I'm muted.
[274:56.74]I think the tablets that we found in the lizard area allow you to combine together to create an eclipse, so look for the tablets inside the storage.
[275:07.37]Solar tablet fragment.
[275:09.89]That would be it.
[275:10.43]Yeah, I think you need four, and then you can summon one eclipse.
[275:12.55]It has to be daytime.
[275:13.45]Really?
[275:16.16]uh it is and then I can third potion and then we'll get it for sure okay so I can yeah it's eight of these fragments to make a solar tablet to summon an eclipse so let's just make a couple of them yeah we're really gonna need one okay but they're not used for anything else as far as I remember well I'll just make one
[275:47.74]I'm not even using these grenades.
[275:50.04]What is this?
[275:53.16]Shoddy Ebony Tail.
[275:54.36]I just picked this up randomly outside.
[275:57.34]I built a house in her house.
[275:59.94]She's pissed off.
[276:03.25]Watch out for those scorpions.
[276:05.73]I love these guys.
[276:06.35]The painter can't even leave now.
[276:11.77]I'm loving it.
[276:13.07]Yes.
[276:14.75]I don't care if the other ones are better.
[276:16.61]These ones are more fun.
[276:25.29]Alright, this looks good.
[276:29.47]Should I re-roll this?
[276:31.13]I'm gonna re-roll this.
[276:32.23]1% melee speed is absolute dogshit, and we have money.
[276:34.46]I have enough money to do it once.
[276:43.94]1% melee speed.
[276:44.94]Like, come on.
[276:45.70]That's terrible.
[276:51.68]Here we go.
[276:52.02]1, 2, 3...
[276:56.78]Well, I guess better than it was before.
[276:59.46]Okay, I got the tablet.
[277:13.49]Where are my potions?
[277:15.43]Let me see.
[277:17.09]These things suck.
[277:18.09]I'm getting rid of these.
[277:18.73]I'm going to sell them.
[277:26.29]Wormhole.
[277:26.95]I need to buy a new potion.
[277:27.93]What do we have for potions in here?
[277:32.27]Oh, we got a ton of things in here.
[277:33.59]Greater healing potions.
[277:34.59]Let's take them.
[277:40.46]Ancient ice chunk.
[277:41.34]I'm gonna store this for now.
[277:45.38]Stars.
[277:45.92]Who needs them?
[277:47.72]Alright, summoning potion.
[277:49.08]That's what I want.
[277:49.66]Let's take them all.
[277:55.63]Builder.
[277:56.67]Mining.
[278:00.14]Night Owl.
[278:00.70]Shine.
[278:01.24]Spelunker.
[278:02.00]Here we go.
[278:02.44]Mana regen.
[278:03.08]Regeneration potion.
[278:09.06]Swiftness potion.
[278:10.56]Oops!
[278:11.32]It's okay.
[278:13.67]I think I just threw that in the trash.
[278:14.91]Oops.
[278:16.71]No, it's going in there.
[278:19.59]Okay.
[278:19.75]Okay.
[278:23.55]So now I need the other potions that he sells.
[278:28.01]Good to know.
[278:31.39]Which ones should I get?
[278:34.36]This one looks pretty good.
[278:38.74]Life Force.
[278:39.34]I need more money.
[278:43.14]Give me that Platinum Coin.
[278:44.56]Did you take the Platinum Coin out?
[278:49.48]No.
[278:50.42]What happened to it?
[278:52.34]I didn't do anything.
[279:02.57]Okay.
[279:03.05]Give me this.
[279:07.62]Here it is.
[279:11.58]Magic damage.
[279:12.34]Wait.
[279:13.56]Regen.
[279:16.00]What was that other one that I wanted?
[279:17.18]Regeneration, right?
[279:17.98]I already have seven of these.
[279:24.02]Where was the heart one?
[279:25.50]More at max HP.
[279:28.83]Life force, there it is.
[279:32.99]I gotta get five of each.
[279:35.69]At least.
[279:40.07]Wormhole's fine.
[279:40.73]Alright.
[279:45.07]Das, I'm gonna... I told you, this is a chunky soup stream.
[279:49.25]I'm not done after this.
[279:49.91]Yeah, you guys have to stay up for another 30 hours.
[279:53.79]After Terraria, I'm gonna go take, like, a bathroom break, come back, and we're gonna play DOS.
[280:00.92]This is not gonna be, like, a five-hour stream today.
[280:03.08]I told you guys yesterday, or the day before, this is gonna be, like, at least, like, a seven to nine, eight-hour-plus stream.
[280:14.04]Oh, we need extra remote for that.
[280:17.64]What's this new thing over here?
[280:23.24]Where's this cob... That's where the cobweb is.
[280:26.60]I get it now.
[280:27.34]Okay.
[280:28.97]I was like, what the fuck?
[280:29.97]I have like 280 cobweb.
[280:33.05]Yeah, it goes to your ammo.
[280:38.09]But I'm sure you already know that.
[280:40.47]Kind of at this point, but I guess I'll keep the rope.
[280:43.21]Oh, get rid of that.
[280:43.99]Get rid of this.
[280:51.82]Alright.
[280:53.14]Uh, what's next?
[280:56.80]Um, we never found the dungeon chest for the one thing.
[281:02.15]That's right, we did not.
[281:06.13]Didn't lie about DOS, no.
[281:07.99]We're still gonna do it.
[281:09.51]I already got it ready.
[281:11.25]I was prepared.
[281:12.42]I have at least a couple of games on DOS ready after this.
[281:15.98]I'm gonna go to the bathroom, get some water after this, and we'll go.
[281:28.82]Alright, soldiers.
[281:31.24]What do you say?
[281:35.64]Nightbot died?
[281:36.30]Oh.
[281:37.48]Oh, well.
[281:47.85]So, are you... Do you have any stingers?
[281:49.73]Are you, like, baking a cake, or... Do you have any stingers?
[281:52.55]Yes, I have put them in the box.
[281:55.39]Okay.
[281:56.61]We're gonna fight this boss.
[282:04.94]Fight this boss.
[282:07.62]The Plaguebringer Goliath.
[282:10.28]Okay.
[282:12.24]I think we can just summon it here.
[282:15.52]I'm also just realizing these guys are 150% larger.
[282:20.75]So they're just, like, huge.
[282:25.07]Um... I can't summon it.
[282:30.81]It might have to be daytime or something.
[282:32.93]Daytime or something.
[282:41.91]Whatever that means.
[282:43.63]Oh, we have to go to the jungle.
[282:45.19]I love going to the jungle.
[282:46.81]We always seem to have to do that, huh?
[282:49.16]Do they fly with me?
[282:53.34]Like they fly on little broomsticks.
[283:00.81]They just annihilated that thing, whatever it was.
[283:03.89]I don't even know what it is.
[283:06.83]Oh, shit.
[283:07.61]We're doing this.
[283:08.47]Come back to me.
[283:08.95]Come back to me.
[283:12.05]The Martians are invading?
[283:14.07]This gives you some crazy fucking OP items.
[283:17.79]But spaceships are really tricky.
[283:19.67]We are not strong enough for this.
[283:22.15]Not okay.
[283:23.01]Well, why did we do it then?
[283:24.97]Because when we kill the spaceships, we'll be 10 times stronger than we are right now.
[283:34.15]What's the point of this bunker?
[283:36.32]Because spaceships shoot down laser beams like Independence Day and they can't go in.
[283:40.10]So this is a just-in-case-er.
[283:46.38]zerg potion you're thinking about it that's the thing I am you're thinking about it or you just got your armor right yes oh he's gonna do it he's gonna do it he's gonna zerg potion with the aliens and we're gonna die in 15 seconds
[284:11.35]Only at the spawn, apparently.
[284:15.35]Zerg potion's too much.
[284:16.35]I would do, like, battle, but Zerg was just... There is a block of enemies.
[284:23.10]It really is a pick.
[284:28.60]Um... They're coming.
[284:30.94]It takes time.
[284:31.51]Invasion doesn't end until you've killed them all.
[284:35.07]Oh, I see you.
[284:35.65]Oh, yeah, I do see you over there.
[284:44.33]I mean, they're flying around all over the place.
[284:45.81]Why are they not over here?
[284:48.25]All the invasions, like, warn you before they show up.
[284:50.60]No.
[284:55.06]You need to go to spawn.
[284:56.06]They attack the houses.
[284:59.16]No, I'd be at spawn.
[285:00.70]Everyone's saying we have to be at spawn.
[285:03.28]Okay.
[285:03.46]I don't know.
[285:04.84]I've seen them nod at home.
[285:06.62]Here they are.
[285:14.02]Oh, also you can get the OP UFO mount that just lets you fly forever.
[285:24.02]So you want to be outside or can you fight them?
[285:25.82]Um, okay.
[285:27.99]I'm building another bunker.
[285:36.87]Ow, I just got juggled so bad.
[285:40.85]Oh, I have the perfect weapon for this actually.
[285:44.48]Get out there, guys.
[285:52.87]Watch out!
[285:53.33]Don't get killed!
[286:05.44]Um...
[286:14.97]I used it.
[286:16.35]Why did you do that?
[286:17.91]They're gonna get in!
[286:20.55]They're gonna get in.
[286:22.15]Don't let them.
[286:35.79]EDF!
[286:40.63]They're in!
[286:41.06]They're in!
[286:41.52]They breached!
[286:45.67]Stuff's gonna start to despawn, isn't it?
[287:14.72]What are you talking about Chicken if you spawn really 10,000 things if there is everyone's saying get through it.
[287:22.23]Oh, well, yeah, go get it.
[287:24.11]What?
[287:24.91]my
[287:43.30]I got something.
[287:44.27]Thank you.
[288:13.26]I love how you very reluctantly joined in.
[288:17.69]Well, the correct way to do that would be for you to start and then me to start very loudly after you and then somebody else to do it too.
[288:24.89]Yeah, and then like six more show up.
[288:27.55]Oh, we are the, oh, oh, we are the Valiant in infantry, tree, tree, tree.
[288:31.53]We're the one.
[288:32.55]That was very good.
[288:34.71]It's always how it works.
[288:40.73]So what the hell did we just get for doing that?
[288:42.69]I got the Bard Triangle.
[288:45.01]Shield Generator.
[288:48.60]Lame.
[288:50.48]Electro Rebounder.
[288:53.44]Martian Uniform Torso.
[288:58.62]No, I like the Ranko.
[289:04.97]Green Slime.
[289:06.25]Shield Drone Beacon.
[289:08.79]I gotta start from the top.
[289:09.49]Yeah, you got everything.
[289:10.09]I have to start from the top, man.
[289:11.73]This is like too much for me to even look at.
[289:14.35]Healing.
[289:14.77]Summons a shield drone to rapidly shield allies.
[289:16.67]Holy shit, laser drill.
[289:20.14]Man, I got the same thing.
[289:22.22]Is the shield drone beacon any good?
[289:24.34]Summons a shield drone to rapidly shield allies.
[289:26.50]Shields ally life equal to your bones.
[289:29.54]Healing up to 25.
[289:32.27]Only one shoulder guardian may be summoned at once.
[289:39.25]Wingman Fires a concentrated laser beam
[289:54.76]Oh, man.
[289:56.52]Yeah.
[289:58.74]Holy shit, this thing's awesome.
[290:01.37]Yeah, aliens get a lot of really cool items.
[290:03.19]It uses a lot of mana, but the thing is great.
[290:06.77]Is that the one where you charge up and it's like... It just shoots like a... No, it just shoots a rapid... Straight line.
[290:14.86]oh there's one that like charges and then shoots a straight line super beam that's really cool it's kind of like the sans eye thing the skeleton thing but it happens immediately and can happen way more often and does more damage yeah you can upgrade wingman like 60 times really I have the Illuminati weapon you know triangles are actually a source of power it's in the shape it's like that's why they use the pyramid
[290:44.31]You need two wingmen.
[290:48.18]This thing shoots three at the same time.
[290:55.62]Damn.
[290:56.04]Alright.
[290:57.08]What about some of this other stuff?
[291:00.12]Let me see.
[291:00.66]The shield?
[291:03.11]Should I just maybe just use this?
[291:06.11]Does it count as a summon?
[291:06.93]Can I only have... Let me see.
[291:11.05]Um...
[291:14.20]The banners.
[291:16.74]Now I'm gonna get in trouble if I put this in there.
[291:25.17]There's still a pit!
[291:27.67]Don't you look at the wood.
[291:33.83]Shit, generator, projectiles.
[291:35.55]Reflects enemy projectiles.
[291:37.05]How does this thing- I don't understand.
[291:42.20]Uh...
[291:47.92]Shield, drone, I already have one of these, but whatever.
[291:51.16]Cactus, leaf, desert, feather, talon.
[291:55.84]I don't really know what this is for.
[291:59.24]I don't even want to open the presents, I don't care.
[292:03.88]Alright, let's go check out and see what this shield thing does.
[292:10.79]I don't think it's going to do anything unless you actually have bonus healing, like you have stat points.
[292:16.28]Are items going towards that?
[292:17.76]I guess, but I don't think it's... It's not technically a summon, but is it... No, it's not a sentry either.
[292:23.95]I can just have it.
[292:25.17]Does it matter if I have zero?
[292:28.87]I can just kind of have it here.
[292:31.85]I guess it doesn't matter.
[292:33.49]I guess not.
[292:39.60]It's cute.
[292:40.54]I guess it is just kind of cute.
[292:42.06]What's the harm?
[292:45.77]uh where come here let me see oh you're all the way out there I forgot why I came this way I had a very good reason I need to start to move some stuff around I know that for you we need to kill the um
[293:08.20]that's that cryogen and calamity mod gives you a really crazy sentry uh ability it gives you a whole bunch of really good stuff but mostly that we should be able to do it though alright so you want to do that
[293:29.21]What's your plan here?
[293:30.39]You said that you didn't want to go that long.
[293:33.11]I changed my mind.
[293:33.77]It's Terraria, man.
[293:34.89]Once you're in it, you're in it.
[293:36.85]Because it's been five hours right now.
[293:40.77]I'm good to go.
[293:41.43]Alright, well then, let me just go pee.
[293:43.81]Let me come back.
[293:45.55]It's been five hours and I haven't gone pee.
[293:51.12]I'll be right back.
[293:52.66]Go pee-pee.
[295:01.67]Thank you.
[297:10.88]hey I have returned hello I'm back did you miss me uh hello I actually you know what I really did well that's good let's test it on the pig
[297:39.88]This thing is absolutely destructive.
[297:44.84]What is?
[297:45.80]The alien laser beam.
[297:48.74]Oh, yeah.
[297:51.58]Oh, yeah.
[297:53.28]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[297:54.38]Alright, so I have the solo tablet.
[297:56.06]What was... I don't even remember what we were doing this for.
[297:59.10]What did I need?
[297:59.66]I needed something.
[298:01.88]For what?
[298:03.91]I don't know.
[298:04.43]We needed to do the eclipse for something.
[298:06.41]Oh, we needed to do the eclipse for the broken staff.
[298:10.89]Broken hero staff.
[298:12.19]That's during the daytime.
[298:13.33]We were going to go to the jungle to fight Plaguebringer Goliath.
[298:17.85]And then I saw the Martian thing on the way.
[298:19.58]Broken hero staff.
[298:20.56]Right, okay.
[298:21.16]So let's go back to the jungle.
[298:28.06]You head there and I'll teleport to you.
[298:30.08]Okay.
[298:33.66]Touch the table.
[298:35.94]Bring out one of my other, another couple guys.
[298:39.77]And away we go!
[298:57.88]I love all these friends.
[299:00.14]They just surf on their spirits great.
[299:04.03]And then sometimes they all just collectively look down and go, kill it!
[299:07.49]And they all just do a dive down and kill the thing that's there.
[299:10.69]Okay.
[299:13.01]Jungle.
[299:14.83]I have acquired the jungle.
[299:18.47]It's dark down here.
[299:19.31]Okay.
[299:29.40]Summoning it over here.
[299:32.99]Oh, hey, here's a Plaguebringer.
[299:34.79]Hey, did we walk over here five seconds ago?
[299:40.22]Might as well just spawn one.
[299:44.72]I didn't buy any potions.
[299:45.68]This guy might be a little tricky.
[299:46.86]Do you have platforms or anything?
[299:51.99]Uh, I do not.
[299:55.05]I do not.
[300:08.80]Dang.
[300:12.24]Whoa, what the fuck?
[300:14.78]Did you summon this?
[300:16.20]Yeah.
[300:17.32]Okay, it's a lot stronger than I thought it would be.
[300:20.50]This is like endgame level shit.
[300:27.84]At least in terms of damage it deals if it hits you.
[300:35.02]He's really fast.
[300:37.81]I'm poisoned too.
[300:42.62]No, that exploded!
[300:43.26]How do you dodge that?
[300:57.69]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[301:11.29]38% though, that's not terrible.
[301:14.21]Yeah, I mean, pretty good.
[301:16.21]It's just... Oh shit, he didn't go away.
[301:20.38]He's still there?
[301:23.24]Let's go!
[301:23.72]Aww.
[301:34.17]Damn it.
[301:39.43]Unfortunate.
[301:46.86]Is there any good food in here?
[301:48.18]What would it be under?
[301:55.19]Where are like the burgers?
[301:59.05]Somebody has like a burger, right?
[302:01.21]The cook is to the right.
[302:03.43]I want just like the meatiest food.
[302:07.21]Yeah, I think we would beat it if we actually potioned.
[302:09.09]I mean, I like panic potioned, but it wasn't very good.
[302:16.29]Cook?
[302:16.66]I don't see a cook.
[302:20.50]He's outside of our base in a random house.
[302:25.90]Why is he down here?
[302:26.86]I don't know.
[302:28.76]Some people just end up out there.
[302:31.77]Let's see.
[302:34.57]Steamed carrots.
[302:37.75]Full for 45 seconds.
[302:42.15]Increase knockback.
[302:45.54]Increase magic damage.
[302:53.34]Movement speed.
[302:55.24]Life regen.
[302:55.90]Here we go.
[302:56.30]Apple pie.
[302:57.94]That's the one I want.
[303:12.43]I'm juicing up, dude.
[303:14.93]You wanna try that again?
[303:16.69]Yeah.
[303:17.11]I need to make another summon.
[303:21.33]It's time.
[303:21.89]I think I'm gonna go with the other summon for this.
[303:24.84]I forgot how I made it.
[303:26.08]Yeah, that's the problem, is that they're on the ground.
[303:34.72]And a lot of the best, like, hardest bosses are flying around.
[303:40.29]Yeah, the Ice Claspers are definitely better for this.
[303:51.07]I have to de-summon you guys.
[303:52.93]Okay.
[304:03.60]I have my Ice Claspers.
[304:05.02]They should be much better.
[304:08.88]Uh, am I blind?
[304:09.78]I shouldn't have it.
[304:11.40]What is this altar that's over here?
[304:15.67]I'm gonna use this as well.
[304:16.97]Feels like it's better than aiming with this, because he flies around so fast.
[304:20.31]Are we just going back to where we were?
[304:29.92]Yeah, I'm trying to figure out... Oh, I need lead bars.
[304:32.52]That's kind of random.
[304:34.04]Wait, no, I have them.
[304:34.74]Wow, I run into a tree?
[304:48.32]What would I give Terraria out of ten?
[304:50.02]Obsidian.
[304:50.56]Um... I don't know.
[304:57.99]A four?
[305:00.65]I'm kidding.
[305:02.59]Alright, that went too far.
[305:06.55]I have no obsidian.
[305:09.98]And we have none.
[305:16.66]Um, I don't know, like 8.5?
[305:17.64]7?
[305:17.66]8.4?
[305:17.68]8.8?
[305:17.70]8.4 maybe?
[305:18.52]Yeah, 8.4.
[305:19.10]I'm sticking with that one right now.
[305:22.84]8.4 Omega Lull.
[305:49.54]That's pretty, that's good!
[305:50.70]Alright, what would you give it?
[305:59.54]You are like Mr. Terraria.
[306:01.00]What would you give Terraria?
[306:04.15]Um... 10.
[306:11.09]That's a lie.
[306:12.57]No.
[306:13.41]It's not, you're not gonna give this game a 10.
[306:14.83]I know that for a fact.
[306:16.39]Why wouldn't I give this game a 10?
[306:20.22]Because I know that you're just being facetious.
[306:24.36]I'm not.
[306:28.25]What is a better...
[306:33.65]craft-em-up game that Terraria doesn't deserve the 10 because it's the best one.
[306:38.43]Yeah, but 10 for a certain category or... I'm talking like overall, like how you feel about the game, not... Just because this is a better crafting game than DayZ doesn't mean that it's... Then every single other one, I think that's enough to be like, you know what?
[306:52.81]Something has to define what a 10 is.
[306:56.08]And I think Terraria sets the bar.
[306:59.67]in my opinion for the type of game that I like what's a game that's six out of ten days gone exactly I'm sorry you're disappointed that I liked this thing I really let you down days gone might be like a 5-8 what's a better craft him up uh
[307:36.00]I don't know.
[307:36.50]I'm trying to think of, like, what... What's going on here?
[307:41.28]Um... Are you over there?
[307:43.90]I'm just trying to think of something.
[307:51.00]Star Forge?
[307:52.06]No.
[307:53.12]No.
[307:54.22]Are you fucking kidding me?
[307:57.74]Well, I mean, I didn't go that... I didn't, like, go that far, but I played Star Forge for, like, an hour.
[308:07.12]uh I don't know I guess there's not I guess there isn't like a better crafting adventure fighter kind of game I mean Minecraft do you see what this is doing yes what is it doing it's going to do that all the time and it's not giving me any shield it's just going to annoy you it's like putting zeros over my head
[308:38.38]I thought those were bubbles.
[308:42.74]Okay, so, uh, don't use that thing.
[308:46.54]Oh, wait, I needed obsidian, that's why I was down there.
[308:48.81]Dude, I got so distracted by that Toria question, and I found the mushroom biome.
[308:54.61]I mean I do it yeah okay overall I think it's like somewhere in the eights but I guess it is like probably like the best or one of the better crafting fighting so here's the question because you're doing right now what you're doing is the game of the year is an 8 out of 10 rather than being a 10. what what would have to happen for the best game of its genre to become a 10
[309:20.97]well that's a it's a very personal question because like what I think is a 10 overall you might not think is a 10 overall well yeah I'm asking you what you think the game is missing uh I don't think it's missing anything I think it needs to have things taken away like what I think it's a little too chaotic
[309:44.08]Well, also remember this is with mods.
[309:46.66]So if you did want what's chaotic.
[309:48.51]Oh, right.
[309:50.07]Well, I can't give you a real opinion then.
[309:55.79]My opinion is completely invalid because I'm not playing the real, true version of the game.
[310:02.72]You see, guys?
[310:03.44]You could learn a lot from Jerma.
[310:04.56]This is how you successfully, with an audience, manage to not have an opinion about something and upset nobody.
[310:10.18]It's a very delicate walk you have to do, but he's very talented at it.
[310:17.58]It's hard to say I'm very talented.
[310:23.19]How is that a delicate... I said the game is like an 8.4.
[310:26.43]That's a very good score.
[310:29.25]That... What?
[310:31.76]I think the game is over a 7, which is like... Wow, a 7 is still a fun game.
[310:38.80]I would play a 7.
[310:40.42]I've played plenty of 7s before.
[310:42.18]So have you.
[310:44.12]Yeah.
[310:45.59]I'm not disagreeing that an 8 is a good score.
[310:47.55]I was just wondering what the points were being taken off for.
[310:51.31]Okay.
[310:55.37]Realistically, it is probably just how chaotic it can get.
[311:01.18]But then you came in with that little rebuttal saying you're playing on mobs, sir.
[311:07.23]That's why.
[311:07.81]So it's like, okay, well, I guess it would be higher.
[311:11.69]I don't know.
[311:18.32]Hi-yah.
[311:21.89]Okay, I'm almost done making it.
[311:23.05]Okay, what's a 6 out of 10 for you?
[311:24.19]What is a 6 out of 10?
[311:25.83]A 6?
[311:26.45]Yeah.
[311:27.45]Like, Days Gone was like a... Out of the highs, 5, maybe.
[311:31.82]6, maybe.
[311:32.30]That's like a 6 out of 10 game.
[311:34.76]Hold on, let me look at, like, installed games.
[311:38.02]Yeah, it's hard to remember.
[311:40.90]Like, all the things.
[311:41.80]Pre-made list of 6s.
[311:44.33]Uh, Sekiro.
[311:45.57]Get mad.
[311:45.99]Um...
[311:54.86]I mean, I didn't like Sekiro as much as I liked Bloodborne.
[312:06.34]I thought Sekiro was a way, way, way worse game than Bloodborne.
[312:15.05]I don't know if I would give Sekiro a 6.
[312:17.81]Get mad!
[312:19.61]I'm not mad at all.
[312:21.50]I'm teleporting to you.
[312:22.76]I'm very calm about this whole conversation.
[312:28.26]Okay, I'm potioning up.
[312:29.92]Yes, so am I. I am putting things down.
[312:36.54]I'm ready.
[312:36.98]As ready as we can be, I guess.
[312:44.97]I got baited by my own guys.
[312:49.25]They went and attacked something over there.
[312:54.08]Try to not stand near each other.
[312:57.52]Because we're getting hit with the same charges.
[313:01.42]Ah!
[313:01.60]Did he really just wait to do it over there?
[313:06.14]Oh my god!
[313:07.06]He just hit me every time!
[313:08.63]He's obnoxious.
[313:10.43]Teleport to town if you need to to heal.
[313:12.39]If not, then teleport on me.
[313:20.19]I'm just gonna live so you can come back.
[313:22.35]I have to put that on a hotkey!
[313:32.64]His hitbox is so big.
[313:41.91]Okay, I'm coming.
[313:42.71]Are you good?
[313:44.89]Yeah, come quick.
[313:51.78]He already got you?
[313:52.50]Fucker.
[313:53.26]He already got me.
[313:53.94]Is he gonna die soon or what?
[314:24.33]He's dead.
[314:25.25]What did he drop?
[314:28.29]I didn't get any.
[314:30.69]Oh, it's all here.
[314:42.99]If you weren't so zoomed in, you could see the boss better.
[314:47.23]The high of 106 range damage.
[314:50.72]launches a variety of rockets that explode into bees.
[314:54.58]Boar's life regen?
[314:55.61]Get rid of that out of here.
[314:59.55]I think that's all I got.
[315:10.66]The hive is a legendary weapon.
[315:18.48]I don't know what ammo it takes.
[315:20.46]We can do the eclipse now.
[315:22.56]Okay.
[315:33.91]I guess rockets.
[315:38.73]Did I go too far?
[315:41.59]Nope.
[315:46.27]Bloodborne is like a 9.9.
[315:47.44]9.8.9.
[315:47.96]No.
[315:49.24]It's a 9.85.
[315:59.06]Yeah.
[315:59.96]I think so.
[316:05.56]Why can't it be a 10?
[316:08.03]Why is everyone so stingy with the 10s?
[316:09.85]Because it's 30 FPS.
[316:13.28]And they didn't decide for any reason to upgrade or deport it or put it anywhere else.
[316:17.86]That's a good point.
[316:20.74]That's an attractive, well thought out point.
[316:24.53]I'm a very smart guy.
[316:29.53]Even on the PS4 Pro, it's a summoning alter.
[316:35.20]What's a 10 out of 10 game?
[316:36.22]Ocarina of Time.
[316:39.36]Super Mario 3d world I mean brothers I mean Super Mario 3. I mean two Super Mario 3d we don't even say that no no it's a new Super Mario brothers we don't say that again oh my god I'm so sorry that actually we're doing the eclipse you need to like get on this okay uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah just do it activate it where's my wait I have the tablet I just dumped it in no I didn't it's right there I saved it
[317:08.85]I want my, uh, I want the Pygmies for this.
[317:11.90]It's more fun that way.
[317:14.60]I'll tell you when I'm ready.
[317:22.24]Alright, you ready?
[317:24.74]Here we go!
[317:25.90]Consuming!
[317:33.46]Super Mario Galaxy?
[317:35.98]There's nothing wrong with Super Mario Galaxy.
[317:40.89]Super Mario Galaxy is very, very good.
[317:50.20]Super Mario Sunshine?
[317:50.98]See, I'm going to have to have an unpopular opinion here.
[317:52.74]I think Super Mario Sunshine is not a good game.
[317:56.50]I'm sorry.
[317:57.00]Do you have any gold?
[317:58.36]Something.
[318:04.03]It's in the box, I think.
[318:06.33]There was one gold in the box.
[318:08.35]I think we're poor.
[318:10.01]We are.
[318:12.51]Unless there's a platinum in there.
[318:15.49]Oh, there is a platinum.
[318:17.09]I don't know if that's unpopular or popular, I just didn't like it.
[318:20.13]I tried it a few times back when it first came out, and then years later, I just, it wasn't doing it.
[318:26.37]What is going on here?
[318:29.87]What the hell is happening?
[318:32.33]You know what's happening.
[318:34.19]What did you do, spawn a boss?
[318:36.47]No, I did Zerg potion.
[318:37.93]Oh shit, of course you did.
[318:42.66]I'm going out there.
[318:52.88]What about Luigi's mansion?
[318:55.06]There's a mini-boss.
[318:58.40]I canceled the potion.
[318:59.38]What the fuck?
[319:03.12]Oh no!
[319:04.69]Not again.
[319:05.27]Not again with this shit.
[319:08.73]It just fluked everybody.
[319:10.03]How could you still fly over here?
[319:20.64]Let me in the door!
[319:28.32]Got it.
[319:30.56]It did like one fly by and everyone died.
[319:33.54]He just did a laser through here.
[319:35.83]I hope I don't need any of those people.
[319:44.99]Save on Painter.
[319:47.63]We could use the Painter right now.
[319:53.73]Wow, are you a video game I'm doing the banjo kazooie thing that they all do Oh see now there's like no enemies in the dumb
[320:15.50]Well, I killed it.
[320:16.68]You didn't even have to turn it off.
[320:17.82]Oh, the potion guy's dead.
[320:20.83]Oh, because I was about to die.
[320:22.07]I was scared.
[320:23.43]I'm sorry.
[320:24.15]I mean, I could buy another.
[320:26.37]Somebody wrote, play something better.
[320:30.19]I have two broken swords.
[320:36.52]I can make a double.
[320:40.52]I got two.
[320:41.12]Wait.
[320:42.20]That's not what I need.
[320:44.95]I need the staff.
[320:46.63]Uh oh.
[320:56.80]Where is he?
[320:58.12]Over here.
[321:03.68]Broken hero bow, two swords, and a hilt.
[321:10.52]No staff, huh?
[321:15.51]that sucks you know what sucks is that the potion guy is dead and it's all your fault
[321:44.60]Somebody said Elder Scrolls has better crafting.
[321:51.53]Okay.
[321:56.97]Elder Scrolls.
[321:57.99]He's entitled to that opinion.
[322:00.01]Can I give you another unpopular opinion?
[322:03.44]What?
[322:04.24]Is this like unpopular video game opinions?
[322:05.82]I think Elder Scrolls games are not good.
[322:09.42]Is that like bad?
[322:17.16]I mean you're wrong and I might I don't know I just I they feel like I don't know oblivion was alright I I liked oblivion for a little while but like I feel like skyrim just didn't just didn't do anything for me at all it's because you're a mod list no no you're not a modless modless you deny it no no I um I did a bunch of mods okay were they nude mods
[322:46.96]This is a safe space.
[322:49.46]No, they were not nudity mods, okay?
[323:03.31]He hesitated.
[323:04.97]No, listen.
[323:07.22]Follow also is not very good.
[323:12.27]I think bethesda did bethesda seriously just like somehow hypnotize everybody to think that they make a good games
[323:22.23]This is unpopular opinion night.
[323:24.05]It is.
[323:24.31]I'm sorry.
[323:25.43]They make a specific type of game that no one else makes.
[323:28.95]Fallout New Vegas was good.
[323:30.67]It was fun.
[323:31.21]It was interesting.
[323:31.87]It was really entertaining, right?
[323:33.61]But Fallout 4, I thought, was not very good at all.
[323:36.91]Fallout 3 was kind of a buggy, broken mess.
[323:39.41]And all the games were like that, too.
[323:41.05]Fallout New Vegas was good.
[323:41.93]I really liked Fallout New Vegas.
[323:49.16]Oblivion was fun.
[323:52.52]You say unpopular video game opinions, and then you say this is the best Fallout.
[323:57.99]I'm going to hit you with Fallout 4 was better.
[324:00.17]No, no, it was not.
[324:01.27]It was not.
[324:01.89]Absolutely not.
[324:02.41]Yeah, it was.
[324:03.05]Fallout 4 was not better than Fallout New Vegas.
[324:04.82]No way.
[324:05.56]Fallout New Vegas was a cheap reskin of Fallout 4 that used things modders had already made for Fallout 4 to make New Vegas.
[324:15.34]Like survival mode that was introduced in Vegas was just a mod for Fallout 4.
[324:20.49]I don't believe this at all.
[324:22.67]How do you not believe it?
[324:23.59]Those are facts.
[324:24.97]Fallout 4 was an action game.
[324:28.03]They had a protagonist that just talked.
[324:31.17]And there was no such thing as interesting stuff.
[324:32.73]There's no factions, no... Wait, wait.
[324:35.33]It was an action game.
[324:36.27]There was a protagonist who talked.
[324:38.01]Yeah, that was the worst part about it.
[324:39.95]It wasn't me anymore.
[324:40.95]It was the guy that sounds like Chris Pratt.
[324:43.61]It was Chris Pratt.
[324:44.21]That was the actor that did it, apparently.
[324:48.76]No, there was no, like, no, no, like, fun things to crazy things, interesting things to do in Fallout 4.
[324:52.88]It was just an action game.
[324:54.58]Chris Pratt is the main character.
[325:03.90]Fallout 4 is an action, that's, I don't, I don't consider Fallout 4 to be, like, a true full RPG, like Fallout New Vegas was.
[325:19.34]It's a fun, yeah, it's a fun action game, but it's not, I, it's not what I wanted from, like, my Fallout game.
[325:24.40]And it was based in the city of Boston, and we're talking about, that's, like, my favorite place.
[325:28.60]So that gets, like, two full letter grades from me.
[325:31.23]But then I moved to Vegas, therefore those two letter grades then transitioned over to Vegas.
[325:35.27]Oh, I was mixing up, I was, I meant Fallout 3.
[325:39.39]Fallout 3 is better than New Vegas.
[325:41.23]Did we really just have a full fucking argument and you were on the wrong game?
[325:45.75]Yeah.
[325:46.45]I was saying they made Fallout 3.
[325:48.42]Fallout 3 is a better game than New Vegas.
[325:50.14]New Vegas just introduced all the new mechanics in New Vegas were just mods like ripped from Fallout 4.
[325:56.78]And from Fallout 3.
[325:57.66]You are arguing for the wrong game.
[326:00.72]But I will still say Fallout 4 is better than both of them.
[326:04.97]What?
[326:05.85]Wait, wait, wait.
[326:07.35]Hold on.
[326:08.79]Fallout 3 is better than New Vegas and Fallout 4 is the best.
[326:17.51]Alright, you better be careful.
[326:18.31]Someone right now is making, like, an incantation-like spell.
[326:22.17]You're gonna get cursed.
[326:23.71]We did Fallout 4 streams, and people liked them, and I said, you know, I'm gonna do New Vegas next, and I installed New Vegas, I installed mods, and I opened it, and I was testing it to make sure it worked, and that game is fucking garbage.
[326:35.21]Wait, which one?
[326:35.97]New Vegas.
[326:38.08]You don't like New Vegas at all?
[326:40.02]Like, at all?
[326:40.64]No.
[326:41.26]No.
[326:42.10]Really?
[326:43.12]I think the story is better, but...
[326:47.44]barely and who cares uh I I thought new Vegas was like very fun and charming he's doing this on purpose I'm not that's the thing though unpopular opinion I actually have these opinions that are so wrong and there's nothing you can do about it
[327:11.27]Well, I mean, I do think that I don't really... Let's put it this way.
[327:15.55]I would not put any of the last 10 to 15 year Bethesda games in like a top 10 list of best games I've ever played.
[327:22.66]I just don't think I would.
[327:25.50]I did enjoy them, some of them, but I thought some of them were also pretty not good either.
[327:32.85]I wouldn't put Fallout New Vegas in like my top 5 best games.
[327:35.61]Top 10 best games.
[327:38.57]I enjoyed a couple of their Bethesda games.
[327:43.32]And that's alright.
[327:44.68]That's completely fine.
[327:47.92]Name the top 10.
[327:48.66]Super Mario RPG.
[327:49.61]Diablo II.
[327:50.09]The Neverhood.
[327:51.85]No, I'm sorry.
[327:54.41]Let me get that right.
[327:55.79]Bloodborne.
[327:56.91]Mario RPG.
[327:59.81]Card crawl.
[328:02.10]Oh my god.
[328:02.80]I'm just kidding.
[328:04.50]Oh no, I was saying oh my god because the bow I've been using is awful.
[328:08.24]Like, the modifier on it is awful.
[328:10.46]I didn't quite catch that.
[328:15.43]Sorcery.
[328:17.45]Yeah, there you go.
[328:23.47]So, are we good to try something else now?
[328:26.95]Or what are you doing?
[328:27.41]Are you good?
[328:27.75]You never got the thing you needed, so we're gonna need to do another... Oh, fuck, that's right.
[328:31.39]Do you have it?
[328:34.74]No.
[328:35.24]You've been handling... Team Fortress.
[328:37.22]Yep.
[328:40.98]Chrono Trigger.
[328:44.92]Oh, wait, what's the current question?
[328:46.14]I was reading... What's, like, your top ten, like, favorite games?
[328:49.23]Best games.
[328:49.73]Top ten?
[328:50.05]Wait.
[328:51.23]yeah Bloodborne's on there for me yes right see it is a very good game so what was okay what was your big problem with the hero um it was just it was just way too like over the top like hard every change that they made to the Dark Souls formula to make it new was bad it was just flat out bad oh um I thought you're gonna say it was a rhythm game
[329:23.04]No.
[329:24.45]Because it was.
[329:24.87]Is that your thing?
[329:29.53]No, I'm one of those weirdos that equally hated and equally loved Sekiro at the same time.
[329:39.70]It's so polarizing in my brain remembering how much I loved certain areas and how much I hated certain other things.
[329:54.02]I wouldn't put sakira at a six though that's just like whoa that's a little too far so how many attempts did you do with the last boss before you said I don't want to do this ever again I'm curious I gave up before then so four then yeah
[330:19.50]at the boss before the last boss?
[330:21.73]I think I did everything up until the final boss and had already seen the final boss on speedrun streams and didn't have the desire to do it.
[330:31.55]I did play it for a while on one stream, but that doesn't count.
[330:37.10]Is Sekiro worse than Dark Souls 3?
[330:42.66]No, Dark Souls 3 is second place after Bloodborne if you're counting Bloodborne as a Soulsborne game.
[330:50.41]So you do Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3, is like your top two.
[330:56.73]And then Dark Souls 2.
[330:58.75]Dark Souls 2 is, you think Dark Souls 2 is better than Dark Souls 1?
[331:01.84]Yeah.
[331:03.04]Did you ever play Demon's Souls?
[331:05.26]No.
[331:05.62]It is your problem.
[331:07.30]You have to play Demon's Souls.
[331:11.76]Bloodborne is number one, Demon's Souls is number two.
[331:15.06]Dark Souls 1 is number three.
[331:19.13]Dark Souls, then probably Dark Souls 3, Sekiro, Dark Souls 2 for me.
[331:24.57]Sekiro, way bottom.
[331:27.38]Throw it in the trash, a bargain bin.
[331:34.10]Alright, the reason why we're sitting around is because we have to wait till the next morning.
[331:37.64]Yeah, we can't do Eclipse until morning and I'm just like going through recipes and stuff.
[331:44.40]There are items that let you skip to morning and stuff like that.
[331:48.11]But I don't... It's almost... I don't... I'm having a nice time talking to my boy.
[331:53.61]You would really like dinosaurs.
[331:55.15]If you liked Bloodborne, it follows a lot of the same weird principles that Bloodborne did, especially like the hub world stuff.
[332:01.79]I've seen quite a bit of it.
[332:04.60]I'm absolutely shocked that they have not done even a... Like a remake?
[332:10.34]Not even a remake, just a remaster.
[332:11.70]Just ported to PS4 with a higher resolution and up the frame rate.
[332:16.29]Why would they not do that?
[332:19.89]I don't think I'll play it unless they do.
[332:22.37]And even then, I've seen enough of it and I'm kind of burnt on too many Souls games as is.
[332:28.49]Oh, dude, what about Elden Ring?
[332:32.35]I'll play it.
[332:35.63]Look, FromSoftware has that formula where they do something so interesting that they're all worth playing.
[332:42.21]Because you know that formula.
[332:44.25]You know it's going to at least somewhat follow that really interesting, unique formula, so it don't matter.
[332:48.95]They're all going to be worth trying or at least worth playing.
[332:55.21]Ah, shit.
[332:56.71]I do need truffle.
[332:58.72]I think.
[332:59.04]Welcome to the podcast.
[333:00.74]This is called the Unpopular Opinion Podcast.
[333:04.99]My friend comes on and makes everyone angry for 30 minutes.
[333:09.06]He just says everything that you could possibly want to agree with while hitting his mic.
[333:14.68]You can't stop him.
[333:16.18]You got a tablet?
[333:16.78]I used mine already.
[333:18.82]I don't have one.
[333:21.18]Well, it's morning, so I'm going to have to make one.
[333:23.98]What's it called?
[333:24.44]Slab?
[333:28.34]Day Slab?
[333:29.18]What's it called?
[333:29.78]Daystone?
[333:31.13]What's the material?
[333:32.45]I don't know.
[333:32.85]You just did the last one.
[333:34.53]I know, but like... Take a look at the screen right now.
[333:39.23]And I want you to see something.
[333:40.15]This is very important for you to see this because you need to understand something.
[333:42.40]How many ice cream flavors are in this box?
[333:47.88]Imagine needing to pick one of these flavors.
[333:53.28]um what's it called solar there it is I'm gonna go to the right you have to use the right utensils for this we're losing daylight what is this thing called the slab okay well
[334:20.94]I'll be back.
[334:22.16]No, no, no, no.
[334:22.78]I'm about to do it.
[334:24.86]You can do it without me.
[334:26.46]I'm just going to grab mud.
[334:27.20]Where the fuck am I?
[334:31.84]Outside on the left.
[334:33.62]Did you have... Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[334:34.89]You put this dumb thing out here.
[334:36.13]No, it's not.
[334:37.81]Now that we've summoned it one time, one of the people should be able to see it, even if you don't have it.
[334:43.71]Okay, guys.
[334:44.63]I'll be back.
[334:45.41]I'm on an important mission.
[334:47.43]Help me out here.
[334:48.07]What the fuck is happening?
[334:50.34]further left what I'm so glad didn't have a battery in my inventory because that would just summon the boss it is am I I thought I just tried to do this alright let's go
[335:27.63]It kind of does the first part of the Bowser laugh from Mario 64.
[335:32.61]That like... You want to talk about an unpopular opinion, there's one.
[335:47.21]If you would take that and slow that down and pitch it down, it would be the exact noise that the actor made.
[335:51.63]You know why?
[335:52.13]Because I'm the actor that did it.
[336:05.08]Someone had to say it.
[336:06.98]Say what?
[336:08.50]You did a shit job.
[336:09.20]No, I didn't.
[336:12.64]No, I didn't.
[336:14.00]Shut up.
[336:15.26]Shut up.
[336:17.02]Shut up.
[336:18.54]Shut up.
[336:19.22]Any more unpopular opinions?
[336:21.16]No.
[336:21.48]Shut up.
[336:22.96]Idiot.
[336:23.24]Shut up.
[336:24.62]I dropped one platinum.
[336:28.37]Whoops.
[336:28.91]I thought I had a lot of health.
[336:30.53]I'm just trying to build the fucking mud biome.
[336:34.91]Where is... Look at these dice thing.
[336:37.87]Uh, what's it called?
[336:39.53]Clasper?
[336:41.83]What's it called?
[336:42.23]Uh, Claspy Supo?
[336:45.25]Oh, it's right here.
[336:58.81]Alright, let me ask you this for our unpopular opinion stream.
[337:02.16]What is... What do you feel about peanut butter fluff?
[337:05.92]Like, fluff.
[337:06.60]Do you like it?
[337:08.48]Pea... What is... What is that?
[337:10.06]You never had fluff before.
[337:11.42]Unpopular.
[337:13.28]So we already got another one.
[337:17.19]I don't know what... I want... Educate.
[337:19.73]Educate.
[337:20.25]It's like a marshmallow fluff cream that you can put on whatever you want.
[337:23.39]It usually goes with peanut butter very well.
[337:25.01]It's called a fluff-a-nutter sandwich.
[337:35.17]You don't believe me.
[337:37.65]Can we not kill this guy?
[337:38.79]I apparently dropped 400 blocks of mud and it's just gone.
[337:45.65]Watch out for Monthron.
[337:51.84]Oh, too many hits.
[337:54.30]Did Monthron die in here?
[337:56.66]Lady, I need help.
[338:01.11]She has a name.
[338:02.65]I don't know what anybody's name in here is.
[338:05.75]If you said I will give you a thousand dollars to name the guy right here on the left, I would not be able to do it.
[338:10.25]I have no idea.
[338:13.61]I couldn't even guess.
[338:14.21]I'll guess.
[338:14.57]I... Finro.
[338:25.21]I don't know.
[338:25.55]Aaron.
[338:26.17]I thought it was an F.
[338:31.75]Nailed it.
[338:40.41]Do you have any mud in your inventory, Jerma?
[338:42.47]Who cares if I have mud or not?
[338:44.10]You don't care.
[338:45.72]I don't know.
[338:46.82]You made fun of me to a point where I stopped picking up this stupid shit.
[338:53.78]And it's come back to bite me.
[338:55.10]It has.
[338:56.54]You should have just let me keep being a moron and putting dirt in the inventory.
[339:00.67]Well, you know what you did?
[339:01.59]And I needed it all, and I used it all, and... Jerma has it confirmed.
[339:09.61]No, I don't.
[339:11.15]I don't have any mud.
[339:13.87]Hey, unpopular opinion yet.
[339:15.07]Mud sucks.
[339:15.90]I know, right?
[339:17.10]It's...
[339:28.67]Mothra on.
[339:34.69]Oh, it's just melting.
[339:37.53]I just melting.
[339:41.95]Oh, this thing is ridiculous.
[339:43.87]Broken hero.
[339:45.29]Shit.
[339:53.02]Or is it?
[339:53.42]I don't know.
[339:55.56]I don't know how good that is, but it looks good.
[340:02.32]You're not melee guy, right?
[340:04.88]Uh, no, I am bow guy.
[340:06.32]Yeah, are you sure you don't want to be melee guy if there was a thing that was like 150 face damage?
[340:09.46]Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
[340:12.24]My last playthrough, I was melee guy.
[340:14.04]I don't want to do it again.
[340:15.34]Okay.
[340:19.44]Oh, yeah, you don't want me to get my main in here, do you?
[340:21.68]I guess not.
[340:27.80]Uh, when is, uh, when do we get another, uh, attack from Mothra?
[340:33.41]I don't know.
[340:33.79]I think we have to kill a certain amount of guys.
[340:40.25]Incoming Modron.
[340:46.79]How did I even get in here?
[340:49.47]That's impossible for me to get in there.
[340:51.79]I didn't... That's not even possible to get in there.
[340:58.66]It is.
[341:00.46]It is though.
[341:01.70]Uh, did not drop a broken staff.
[341:06.04]Alright.
[341:16.61]Oh, the Eye of Cthulhu?
[341:17.79]I really hope we get one more Modron.
[341:20.45]If we get one more Modron, it might work.
[341:24.03]We should, because we did it early.
[341:29.62]Is the warp staff outdated?
[341:31.14]I mean, it kind of is, but it's just free to use.
[341:34.06]It's not like it's taking up any extra space or anything.
[341:35.90]Like, it's half two sentries, so why does it have to use it?
[341:58.02]You've got to be kidding me.
[342:01.68]There's 27 gold in the ground right at the left door.
[342:11.05]What the fuck, man?
[342:12.71]What is even in here?
[342:13.61]It's chasing me!
[342:18.37]Are you serious?
[342:19.55]Dude, I had no... What is in there?
[342:24.58]There's 27 gold right next to you.
[342:25.84]Drop down.
[342:26.84]Drop down right now.
[342:29.25]You can get it.
[342:30.09]No, I can't.
[342:30.81]It's too far.
[342:35.91]Why wouldn't you attack it?
[342:36.75]Because I didn't have any mana.
[342:40.27]That was OOM.
[342:40.95]I'm an OOM.
[342:53.48]Still no broken staff, right?
[342:55.84]No.
[342:57.41]Broken sword, nail gun... Oh man, this is fucking insane!
[343:03.85]313 damage?!
[343:07.21]Wait, what is it?
[343:08.45]What the fuck?!
[343:13.75]I've never even seen it under that high!
[343:27.65]Honestly, like, this is... Should I just... Look at all this stuff.
[343:31.29]I feel like I should just convert to a melee guy.
[343:34.46]This is, like, so much more damage.
[343:37.72]Okay.
[343:47.48]How much damage are your ice claspers?
[343:50.73]57?
[343:51.27]58?
[343:51.99]And how many do you have?
[343:52.81]I don't know, like 7?
[343:55.47]Dude, I don't even know what's in the house.
[344:04.94]It's in the house!
[344:06.36]Whatever it was, it was in the house.
[344:09.65]I'm of the unpopular opinion that maybe we should not build our house with like a fucking bread cut through the middle of it so they can get in.
[344:19.00]We have just an open this whole side here.
[344:22.06]Teleport to me.
[344:23.40]Teleport to me.
[344:24.24]What the fuck?
[344:26.98]What do you mean teleport to me?
[344:28.40]You're right here.
[344:28.97]Never mind.
[344:29.35]Don't.
[344:29.81]You know what?
[344:30.19]I don't fucking need you.
[344:41.79]I said I didn't need you and I meant it.
[344:43.16]Did you get a staff?
[344:50.05]I didn't get anything.
[345:18.00]You motherfucker, die!
[345:22.05]Dude, you need to be able to kill a mini-boss.
[345:36.88]It's too much going on!
[345:44.77]Did you kill it?
[345:46.81]I never saw it.
[345:49.24]I don't have any bullets.
[345:51.08]And I think the guy who sells wooden arrows is dead.
[345:54.22]They just stopped getting in the house.
[345:56.58]Shut the doors.
[345:57.72]They can't get in if you shut the doors.
[345:59.24]Oh, yeah?
[346:00.68]The fucking ring lady just got in.
[346:04.16]Oh, okay, the doors are both closed.
[346:06.12]Let's test that theory.
[346:10.16]Well, I mean, the sexual, like, ghost guys can get in.
[346:14.19]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[346:17.15]You were complaining and normal people were... These guys, like, the ring braids I'm talking about.
[346:25.05]Not the regular zombies.
[346:28.12]I have all of them.
[346:29.68]And they run around in circles.
[346:32.18]You just did a movie mobster laugh.
[346:41.41]I don't even know what that means.
[346:56.87]Okay.
[346:57.99]Any broken steps.
[347:01.56]Tesla defibrillator.
[347:06.49]This thing, okay, look at this.
[347:07.77]This thing has 313 melee damage.
[347:09.27]Okay, but I'm saying, you have 50 damage times 7.
[347:12.69]5, 10, 10, 20, 20, 30.
[347:14.41]And all the damage bonuses from your equipment.
[347:16.60]5%, 5%, 5%.
[347:16.82]It's like 555 damage.
[347:17.70]Okay, can you stop whining now?
[347:19.04]Yeah.
[347:19.26]Yeah.
[347:39.03]Right click to convert.
[347:45.04]I'm just gonna sell the shotgun and stuff.
[347:59.46]What do you mean, the hand cannon?
[348:00.80]Like, none of us is going to use any of this shit, right?
[348:04.92]What?
[348:05.14]You cut out.
[348:05.98]No one's going to use any of this shit, right?
[348:07.30]We're not going to use, like, the cannon, the dart rifle, all this stuff.
[348:12.48]Uh... Likely no.
[348:16.00]Dart rifle is material, and it's a ranged weapon, and I'm doing ranged, so, like, maybe?
[348:19.86]I just tell anything to just keep it.
[348:21.22]Everything.
[348:23.86]Yeah, why not?
[348:26.40]Is it full again?
[348:28.25]No, I'm just saying, like, there's a bunch of just random junk in here of stuff that we're not even gonna use.
[348:35.75]I like this a lot.
[348:37.55]I wish I could- I need a sentry.
[348:40.80]Is there a better sentry thing that I could find?
[348:45.46]Yes.
[348:46.00]We need to kill, um... Cryo-whatever-his-name.
[348:53.30]Boss.
[348:54.52]Cryo-boss.
[348:56.61]I can tell you the materials we need.
[348:58.77]You can start collecting them.
[349:00.29]Okay.
[349:00.71]And then we can kill that boss and you'll get a really good sentry.
[349:03.26]Cool.
[349:06.18]Why are they firing at this person?
[349:17.87]Thanks for the 50 bucks, LaFranda.
[349:19.05]5,000 bits.
[349:22.36]Star, what do you think somebody would give 50 fucking dollars?
[349:25.10]What do you think their comment would be?
[349:27.88]Like, no comment?
[349:28.72]5,000 bits.
[349:30.34]No comment.
[349:31.58]Just guess.
[349:33.23]That's what I'm guessing, is that there was nothing.
[349:35.25]No.
[349:40.15]Okay.
[349:40.37]PB Poo Poo.
[349:42.03]Oh, nice.
[349:42.47]My man.
[349:59.50]Well, thank you for the fucking huge amount of money.
[350:04.64]Star gets fucking 5% of every dollar on this stream, so... Yeah, sorry.
[350:11.42]You need 50 ice blocks.
[350:14.17]And then we have everything else.
[350:15.15]The way you responded to that was... 5%.
[350:22.23]Alright, ice blocks.
[350:23.09]I think I have those in here already.
[350:29.19]No, I think I have this snow in here.
[350:30.79]Alright, ice blocks, you got it.
[350:32.23]And what else?
[350:34.37]Uh, souls of night, souls of light.
[350:37.13]How many of those each?
[350:38.99]Three each.
[350:40.37]Souls of night.
[350:45.83]Okay, souls of light.
[350:50.50]Okay, just need ice blocks.
[350:52.66]How many ice blocks do I need?
[350:55.18]50.
[350:55.72]And you also need Essence of Elume 5.
[350:59.98]Which we should have in there.
[351:01.36]Essence of Elume.
[351:02.82]I got it all.
[351:04.00]I got it all.
[351:06.94]And who makes this?
[351:07.70]You make it at the anvil.
[351:12.82]A cryo key.
[351:14.26]And then we need light.
[351:19.91]And light and then night, right?
[351:22.19]Yep.
[351:24.68]Let's see what happens here.
[351:26.77]At the anvil.
[351:31.19]We have to use it in the snow biome.
[351:36.47]Cryo key.
[351:39.28]Summons cryogen.
[351:42.00]How many of these do you want?
[351:47.10]If we can, make two.
[351:49.11]I can make potential.
[351:50.33]I can make three.
[351:51.70]Make two.
[351:52.10]Because we might die the first time.
[351:54.65]Let's be prepared.
[351:55.75]Potions, etc.
[351:57.55]Alright.
[351:59.79]I'll do my best.
[352:12.40]Does this guy fly around or is he on the ground?
[352:15.95]He flies around and shoots ice projectiles everywhere.
[352:20.11]Okay, so I should not use the Pikmis.
[352:23.21]No.
[352:24.77]Okay.
[352:27.49]Alright.
[352:33.11]Anything else that you need?
[352:35.60]I need wooden arrows.

[352:40.48]Anything else?

[356:11.41]Uh... How much do they cost?
[356:14.01]Okay, I had to... They cost like nothing, but they're annoying to me.
[356:19.43]See, if it were me, I would think that that was a useless item.
[356:22.63]That it's like a Jerma put this in here because he's stupid.

[366:14.89]We need to, like... I'm going back to the bunker.
[366:25.56]We have to exploit the human's weakness, the boredom for killing us.
[367:02.37]Thousands of people their wrist will start to hurt and that's when we strike with the real weapon Good
[367:30.47]Am I like body itches?
[367:56.90]Am I like allergic to this?
[368:01.99]Welcome to the meat grinder.
[368:08.23]I hate the dashes in this game.
[368:09.71]They're too sensitive.
[368:10.66]There needs to be a dash button.
[368:18.14]Too much noise.
[368:20.78]Some of these sounds.
[368:24.52]This actually kinda is fucking with me, I'm not gonna lie.
[368:27.66]This is fucking with my head.
[368:32.89]I'm doing a few hard blinks.
[368:35.23]You know, that's when it gets to the point where you hold on a bit.
[368:37.31]You gotta slow down.
[368:45.10]I'm going in.
[368:53.06]Alright.
[368:55.64]How long does this last?
[368:59.72]Oh, it's done.
[369:04.03]There's a meter at the bottom.
[369:05.51]Alright.
[369:11.51]Deflects enemy projectiles.
[369:18.73]Snowstorm staff?
[369:21.73]Fire the snowflake that follows the mouse cursor.
[369:24.27]63 to 60.
[369:26.72]Let's check that out.
[369:31.69]Glacial Crusher, Icebreaker, Laser Drill, Symphonic.
[369:49.16]Oh, that's the thing you've been using.
[369:58.10]So this does not use mana.
[370:00.93]I can just keep doing it.
[370:03.23]It uses the thing that appears above your head, which is bard inspiration.
[370:07.09]No, I'm talking about the snowflake.
[370:11.92]I guess it just breaks when it hits something?
[370:20.64]Oh, is that a melee weapon?
[370:22.75]No, magic.
[370:35.60]Alright, Star.
[370:39.41]I think I'm going to... I think it's time to transition to the other stuff that I was going to do.
[370:44.67]Okay.
[370:45.45]I've been sick almost six and a half hours.
[370:47.13]Okay, I forgive you.
[370:51.17]How close are we to...
[370:55.30]uh I'll be very very clear and completely and totally open about this that last encounter um just like I I need a break yeah I understand you've said that a couple times I'm understanding what you're where you're coming from I I feel like I just got off uh a ride of the carnival you know the ones that like turn you upside down I've never been upside down before
[371:26.70]Oh no, I don't... There was this ride called, um, there was this ride called the Zipper.
[371:32.07]You ever ride that?
[371:33.53]The Zip, no.
[371:34.61]It's this weird, it's this, like, 12 of these enclosed, uh, canisters.
[371:41.09]And they, they go on a belt up around in a circle, and they are independently can move completely in a circle as well.
[371:48.22]So what happens is, you, there's room for two people in there.
[371:51.61]This thing is on its own independent axis and it's going upside down.
[371:55.71]Yes, we could do this together.
[371:58.97]So that ride sucks so much and always causes a problem for people because at least three or four times a night, they have to spray down three or four of those cans because somebody pukes in it.
[372:12.86]So I feel like I just got off the zipper.
[372:15.26]I really do.
[372:18.24]would you like to get back on the zipper and we could do it again next week next week you're gonna do the zipper uh yeah that's why do you you you want to play this sooner than that uh no no no that sounds good can you stop shutting this door it's I don't want to why I don't know closed doors I hate this door I hate this door
[372:47.52]But, yeah, this is fun.
[372:51.76]How far are we two getting close to the end of the game?
[372:54.23]Okay, so what happens is, you know those things you shouldn't have killed the cultists?
[372:58.97]You kill the cultist guy.
[373:00.85]It summons four pillars around the map, which are kind of like... You kill waves of enemies, then you can destroy the pillar.
[373:07.63]You have to destroy all four.
[373:09.57]And then after you destroy all four, the Moon Lord appears, and he's the final boss.
[373:12.81]Cool.
[373:15.85]Plus all of the other bosses.
[373:18.10]at armada but that's the core game okay so we think we'll be able to get to the end of the base game in like the next couple streams maybe two or three streams uh the next stream will definitely be moon lord I would expect unless we just kind of delay it oh well then we could just I don't know I I'm still having fun time
[373:38.14]Yeah, like the stuff immediately after Moon Lord is a lot of fun because that's when your items start to get ridiculous.
[373:44.23]Like Moon Lord even gives you a portal gun, which is fun to goof around with.
[373:50.01]So now I realize what you meant.
[373:51.30]When you were saying that, so now I know what you meant by you kind of have to just pick something.
[373:56.93]You want, oh, melee, summoning, magic, ranged, rifles.
[374:01.37]Yeah.
[374:02.31]There's so many fucking things in this game that you just have to, you do have to just pick something.
[374:06.29]Well, by this point, you've also specialized every accessory and equipment choice to be like, oh, I'm the summon guy.
[374:12.57]And if you're like, oh, I want to switch to melee, every accessory has to come off and you need to like combine a million.
[374:21.11]Yeah.
[374:21.33]Alright.
[374:23.27]Well, that was fun.
[374:26.54]Yeah.
[374:27.72]Enjoy the rest of your night.
[374:30.04]Everybody over on Star's side.
[374:32.65]And if people are leaving because they wanted to see Terraria, then we'll see you later.
[374:38.73]Moving on to DOS for a few hours.
[374:41.65]Well, we'll see.
[374:42.13]I'm just going to play for like 10-15 minutes to finish this stupid mushroom buy room and stuff.
[374:47.84]Okay.
[374:49.96]Well, everyone say bye to Star.
[374:51.90]Say bye, Star.
[374:53.08]Bye.
[375:01.09]Bye.
[375:01.37]Go away.
[375:40.00]I can't do it.
[375:40.78]I can't.
[375:41.12]I can't bring myself to do it.
[375:45.14]I can't bring myself to do it.
[375:46.75]Because he's, like, not even over here right now.
[375:49.71]And if the whole house was gone when he came back, and he wouldn't even know, and it would be fucking terrible.
[375:54.97]Plus, we have to, like, beat the game.
[375:56.47]No, I'm not going to do that.
[375:58.47]I can't do that.
[375:59.16]Like, I still have to live here over the next couple of weeks.
[376:02.20]Like, no.
[376:04.98]No, that's too far from me.
[376:05.78]I'm not doing it.
[376:09.35]Alright, let's switch to Dawson.
[376:10.11]Let me go.
[376:10.37]I'm gonna go grab a water.
[376:11.59]I'll be right back.
[376:16.39]I'm still here.
[376:16.99]I'm just over there.
[376:19.27]Can I, like, scare him?
[376:36.22]No, I'm gonna get lost trying to do that.
[376:37.52]I'm just leaving.
[376:41.69]I said I was moving on to DOS, so that's what we're going to do.
[376:48.15]But that was fun.
[376:49.73]I'll be right back.
[376:50.46]I'm going to grab a drink, just some water, and I'll come back and we'll do some DOS.
[376:56.32]I already have a few queued up that I think might be interesting.
[376:59.88]I'm going to leave the squad stream, by the way, because why would I still be doing a squad stream?
[377:08.74]Change the title to Games and Demos.
[377:18.02]He's bragging about how he could beat you in PvP.
[377:21.26]Yeah, I feel like the Terraria PvP is the same thing as Diablo II PvP.
[377:25.49]Where you'd have a Sorceress with Thunderstorm and decked out with like plus 40 skills.
[377:30.49]And when you walked out of the Rogue Encampment, you instantly died from the Lightning Bolt.
[377:34.21]So that's fine.
[377:34.81]It's probably pretty imbalanced.
[377:41.52]I'll be right back.
[377:42.82]See you in like two minutes.
