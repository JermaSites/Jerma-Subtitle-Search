[00:01.40]Now, I'll tell you.
[00:02.86]All of you that tell me that going to the bathroom the second way takes less than 10 minutes.
[00:10.28]Nope.
[00:10.94]No.
[00:11.34]It does not.
[00:11.72]I don't know how you do that.
[00:13.94]How is it possible?
[00:17.46]How do you do it?
[00:17.82]It takes five?
[00:18.31]No, it does not.
[00:18.77]No way.
[00:19.03]I don't believe that person at all.
[00:21.63]It is such... It takes so much.
[00:23.33]You have to get in there.
[00:26.61]You have to get comfortable.
[00:28.73]That takes about 60 seconds.
[00:32.80]then you have to be ready if sometimes it's not all the way ready that takes a good solid minute or two for that to happen simply simply wiping your eye takes like at least a few minutes
[01:00.93]You can't say- I can't say that!
[01:02.99]That's a bad word!
[01:08.03]And then after you're done, you have to- you sit there and contemplate the world for five minutes.
[01:14.30]That is the best place to decompress all knowledge in your brain.
[01:20.58]You sit there and you just take the world in for like five to ten minutes.
[01:29.36]If I don't get my decompress the world time, I did not go number two.
[01:36.33]If I don't get that five minutes of like opening up a Twitter thread and judging every single person in it, if I don't get that five minutes on the toilet, I'm sorry.
[01:47.97]I did not go number two.
[01:56.28]Are you even potty trained?
[02:07.41]Imagine I have one of those little toilets.
[02:11.21]Like little kids.
[02:17.40]Why is there no plumbing installed in your house?
[02:21.24]I don't know.
[02:22.34]I don't know why.
[02:22.96]I don't know what that is.
[02:25.58]Not putty-trained.
[02:26.78]You're gonna love him.
[02:40.25]A tweet?
[02:40.71]Oh shit, you're right, tweet.
[02:41.97]Anyways, the reason people are saying, why are you talking about this?
[02:44.53]This is why the stream is 20 minutes late.
[02:47.77]What's that, um... Newton's third law of aerodynamics?
[02:52.62]Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.
[02:55.88]Somebody made that up.
[02:57.54]That's somebody's law.
[03:02.31]Murphy's law.
[03:02.93]Okay, yeah, right.
[03:05.67]Like, Otto had to go to the bathroom.
[03:07.21]I had to go to the bathroom.
[03:08.85]I was hearing a weird noise.
[03:10.97]I had to, like, investigate the noise.
[03:13.21]I need to water my... I have a plant.
[03:14.55]I need to water my plant.
[03:25.83]When is the McDickey game night?
[03:29.40]Soon.
[03:30.52]But not next week.
[03:31.24]Probably the week after.
[03:34.70]Alright, so let's... Here's his plan.
[03:36.16]Let me tell you what's going on here.
[03:37.44]Hello, welcome back, by the way.
[03:41.12]What kind of plant?
[03:41.78]It's a money tree.
[03:43.77]Because...
[03:45.54]It's like, I think it's a cool looking, it's a little money tree, it's a braided money tree.
[03:50.28]And, um, if you have one of those in your house, then you get to be, you're a millionaire.
[03:55.42]You get to be a millionaire, right?
[03:57.56]I water it every day and I fucking make sure it's completely healthy and I put it in the exact spot it wants to be in in the sun.
[04:06.95]Except, here's the funny thing about a money tree, I believe you're supposed to be gifted a money tree.
[04:11.76]I don't think you're supposed to just buy one and hope to be a millionaire.
[04:14.68]Like, it's not a scratch ticket.
[04:17.68]Like, I don't know, that's not accurate.
[04:20.51]I believe you're supposed to be gifted one.
[04:25.19]You don't just buy one like a fucking lottery ticket.
[04:30.33]No, I like plants now.
[04:31.59]I'm a plant person now, okay?
[04:34.25]I've got, like, three plants in my place.
[04:37.77]And I take very good care of them.
[04:39.51]And they have names, too.
[04:41.15]Huey, Dewey, and Louie.
[04:45.06]Let me tell you, Louie is quite the troublemaker.
[04:48.46]He's quite a troublemaker.
[04:53.48]Alright, let me- I'll be right back.
[04:54.46]Let me tweet.
[04:54.78]I'll be right back.
[05:38.21]I didn't even tweet.
[05:38.81]I'll tweet right now.
[05:43.09]Oh, by the way, people are asking about the title.
[05:47.03]Okay, the reason why the title is the way it is is because think of every pawn TV show or media.
[05:56.24]It's always about, like, porn.
[05:59.32]Hardcore pawn.
[06:01.74]Okay.
[06:02.60]Pawn stars.
[06:04.52]Pawn.
[06:05.40]Pawn.
[06:07.20]So I figured that, you know, the generation, the Zoomers and the Millennials will understand this one.
[06:14.59]And coming up next, on enough pawn tabs to crash my computer.
[06:21.23]They're gonna buy a helicopter!
[06:23.94]But will they?
[06:35.79]Oh, you guys are pretty torn on this title.
[06:37.57]I'm not sure.
[06:38.07]I don't know how to gauge it.
[06:46.63]Stop with the plus twos chat.
[06:48.29]It was clearly a -2.
[06:50.43]Oh, you guys can debate that for a little while.
[06:52.19]Okay.
[06:54.83]Alright.
[06:55.23]It's a pawn game.
[06:56.35]It looks really fun.
[06:56.95]It looks really engaging.
[06:58.48]It looks really interesting.
[06:59.34]So we're going to play it.
[07:01.10]What am I talking about?
[07:04.43]Have you not seen any Pawn TV show?
[07:07.33]They're all porn references.
[07:08.68]Hardcore Pawn and Pawn Stars.
[07:13.10]What are you talking about?
[07:14.68]How dare you?
[07:15.32]Okay, Pawn Shop game.
[07:21.59]Here's the Twitter.
[07:22.25]Here's the Twitter.
[07:32.63]Okay.
[07:36.06]I know I can set this to be auto-tweet, but I don't want to connect my Twitch to anything.
[07:40.24]It always freaks me out.
[07:41.10]Alright, tweet is out.
[07:46.42]We can get started here in a sec.
[07:55.02]Is it afraid of technology?
[07:56.40]I don't know, I just don't like connecting everything.
[08:02.65]You were making this up.
[08:03.62]What am I... Alright, now I'm just being... Hold on a second.
[08:08.28]My laundry's almost done.
[08:09.90]It just went into spin cycle.
[08:13.70]I'm just trying to play a game here, man.
[08:20.48]What's that?
[08:20.96]Popcorn?
[08:21.88]Yeah, I got a popcorn machine right here.
[08:25.88]Are you angry?
[08:26.40]I'm not angry.
[08:26.88]What are you talking about?
[08:28.33]I got a frog in my throat today, though, so you're going to hear a lot of...
[08:32.15]Mutes like that.
[08:32.73]I guess it's like an annoying frog.
[08:34.63]It won't go away.
[08:39.00]Alright, let's go.
[08:39.70]I think we're ready.
[08:41.80]Are we?
[08:44.82]I think so.
[08:50.36]This is called No Umbrellas Allowed.
[08:53.97]And I'm very excited.
[08:59.61]Do a ribbit?
[09:00.53]Oh, speaking of ribbits, I got a quick story for you.
[09:02.59]It's really, really small.
[09:04.13]You know when you do one of those burps?
[09:06.04]That's an internal burp.
[09:07.30]It's almost like a frog burp.
[09:09.20]Where your stomach goes like, and it comes back down really fast.
[09:14.42]So I had my iPad on my... I have like a little thing that holds my iPad.
[09:18.84]And it just sits in this little tray.
[09:20.94]And I put that on my stomach.
[09:23.44]And it's like a keyboard too.
[09:25.48]So it's like a little like half fake laptop little thing.
[09:29.22]And I did one of those.
[09:30.20]I was just sitting there with my arms behind my head watching like a YouTube video.
[09:34.27]And I went like... And the thing bounced up like somebody was on a trampoline.
[09:38.57]And it almost hit me right in the face.
[09:41.15]It was scary.
[09:44.39]It bounced like... Almost hit me right in the bottom lip.
[09:48.01]It was terrifying.
[09:54.72]Alright, we're going to play a new game.
[09:58.38]2080 Ajik City.
[10:00.76]My throat is annoying.
[10:11.82]It was a cool story.
[10:12.52]I told you it wasn't even a story.
[10:14.74]Last night there was a massive explosion at the Citizens Alliance Research Institute, a central bunker district.
[10:23.54]Due to the explosion, most of the artificial rain tech files and the fixer manufacturing facilities are all gone.
[10:31.22]Look at some water.
[10:32.13]I've been drinking water all morning.
[10:34.13]I had a big salad, too.
[10:35.05]I had a whole... I almost ate an entire avocado today.
[10:37.01]Hopefully I don't shit my pants.
[10:39.38]The government and the Association of Victims of Avarice Crimes have announced that they need at least eight more weeks to resume the Fixerain project.
[10:47.22]For now, Ajax City, the last city waiting for the Fixerain, is to stay dry for a few more weeks.
[11:05.39]Hey.
[11:06.75]Are you dead?
[11:12.10]Please.
[11:13.30]Help me.
[11:14.70]Shush.
[11:15.50]An AVAC guy is coming.
[11:19.92]Hey, Cheb, thanks for the 25 community subs.
[11:21.86]Listen to me.
[11:22.20]What the fuck?
[11:25.68]This is Dalping Joe from whatever it was.
[11:29.58]Oh, look at the night sky.
[11:31.38]More beautiful than ever, isn't it?
[11:33.70]Thanks for the subs, though.
[11:34.36]That's a lot of subs.
[11:35.40]25.
[11:36.52]What's wrong with him?
[11:37.38]Is he injured?
[11:38.44]Is he from the institute?
[11:43.53]No, this is my son.
[11:44.57]He's got weak legs since he was a child.
[11:47.97]It's typical, don't worry.
[11:50.64]Do you need any help?
[11:52.38]No, everything's fine.
[11:53.30]As long as every character is over the age of 70 today, I'll be able to be fine.
[12:09.41]Lucky me, you fit the profile.
[12:17.13]Pudding throat.
[12:17.91]I know.
[12:18.35]I'm trying to work on it.
[12:25.44]Hey, you're here.
[12:27.30]The doctor said your face got the most injuries, so he covered your whole face with bandages.
[12:34.66]You can take them off after a week, but he's not sure your face will be the same as it was before.
[12:42.59]Ah.
[12:45.72]I'm Darcy, just an old-timer who owns a secondhand shop nearby.
[12:49.14]Oh, here it comes.
[12:51.96]And from this moment, you'll be my son, Bob.
[12:56.30]I know you're not just an ordinary fugitive, and AVAC will keep track of you as you show up right after the accident.
[13:04.85]So after you get back on your feet, you should manage my store, pretending you're my son.
[13:12.53]Store is on the B1 level of the Batopolis in Sing Sing Side.
[13:16.93]It's just across the bridge.
[13:19.41]And you.
[13:22.33]Um, do you have a phone?
[13:23.34]Can I call my, like, parents?
[13:25.44]Like, why is this guy making this, like, whole thing up about me?
[13:28.06]It's like, dude, I, like, live, like, an hour away.
[13:30.22]Okay.
[13:39.36]Okay.
[13:41.21]So I got a thousand V-Bucks.
[13:43.47]And I have to help manage his store.
[13:45.93]Alright.
[13:46.79]So there's B1.
[13:47.37]What's this?
[13:53.03]Hey, you're new here, aren't you?
[13:54.91]You gotta pay a fee to pass through here.
[13:58.88]What are you staring at?
[14:01.58]Looks like you really are new here, falling for this crap.
[14:04.28]What?
[14:05.90]What?
[14:07.52]Beat it before I make you pay.
[14:08.92]What?
[14:09.10]What?
[14:10.10]Why is everyone's minus 2-ing me?
[14:12.16]I didn't even do anything.
[14:15.32]Oh, because it looks like Rick.
[14:17.08]And if I had said that, I would have been in big trouble, okay?
[14:21.65]Oh, was the V-Bucks joke?
[14:22.81]No!
[14:23.79]Okay, so what's worse?
[14:24.81]Me?
[14:25.05]Alright, whatever.
[14:25.55]Fine.
[14:26.07]I'll take that loss.
[14:26.79]That's fine.
[14:28.09]Okay, so I don't... Who is this person?
[14:30.79]Mine is doing the V... Okay.
[14:33.39]Alright.
[14:34.05]We're gonna go B1.
[14:37.57]B1 be up or B1 be...
[14:42.88]What is this?
[14:43.24]Bus stop.
[14:44.36]How can I tell what floor I'm on?
[14:46.70]Darcy's son is back in town.
[14:48.03]I don't know.
[14:51.31]B1 to me is like basement 1.
[14:52.63]Isn't it?
[14:54.29]What about this cat?
[15:00.90]It is.
[15:01.40]Yeah.
[15:03.86]Simruk Lofts.
[15:05.42]Okay.
[15:08.34]Move to... Wait, what do you mean move?
[15:10.44]Move.
[15:13.41]By the way, why aren't you looking for a job?
[15:16.27]What for?
[15:16.75]We'll soon all get fixed anyway.
[15:18.57]Is this the store?
[15:21.38]No.
[15:22.58]Junk side.
[15:23.16]Alright, that's the store.
[15:27.60]Ajak City for runaways.
[15:29.22]What if they pour out fixed rain tomorrow?
[15:30.82]So what, there's like a rain that they drop on us?
[15:38.23]I wish Junuk's side could be developed even by half of... I don't know.
[15:43.13]I can't read.
[15:46.63]Don't rush.
[15:47.19]It's dangerous.
[15:50.31]What's your purpose in Sing Sing's side today?
[15:52.58]This is low.
[15:53.08]I gotta turn this up.
[15:55.10]Buy some flowers and clothes to do hair, too.
[15:57.12]I'm going to the secondhand shop.
[16:01.08]Coming with me?
[16:03.93]Nah, I like to buy new ones, okay?
[16:06.81]-2, I feel it.
[16:08.09]You can't just predict a -2.
[16:10.01]That's not how it works.
[16:11.25]Like, you have some type of telepathic ability to tell when I'm going to tell a joke that's not funny.
[16:19.08]This does look like Pickle Rick, though.
[16:21.18]It does.
[16:21.70]Looks like double Pickle Rick.
[16:22.82]I'm surprised I didn't... Alright, that person was right.
[16:25.00]I don't know how you did that, but, like, fuck off.
[16:26.87]How'd you do that?
[16:27.35]Fucking asshole.
[16:30.11]Whatever.
[16:33.76]He's out here.
[16:34.38]Today again, we want change.
[16:36.44]Okay.
[16:38.38]There's an office.
[16:39.74]AVAC must stop rebuilding the Institute.
[16:42.88]We must keep Ajak City safe from Fixer.
[16:47.60]AVAC must stop oppressing citizens.
[16:49.46]Throw away your greed to me.
[16:50.96]Okay.
[16:53.38]EMT Center.
[16:54.09]It's like a hospital?
[16:56.01]Your donation perfects Fixer.
[16:57.51]Support the AVAC.
[17:01.81]Well, I don't want to do that.
[17:04.03]Emotion Mitigation Treatment Center.
[17:08.71]Ooh, the lower floor.
[17:11.30]Fuck.
[17:11.60]Where am I supposed to go?
[17:13.54]I have a debt?
[17:14.08]Hold on.
[17:15.52]Come to Darcy's.
[17:16.20]It's on level B1.
[17:18.02]Podopolis Sing Sing side.
[17:19.50]So I gotta go down.
[17:24.27]There it is.
[17:24.59]Okay.
[17:24.73]This is Darcy's.
[17:29.07]Never seen the floaty around.
[17:32.11]We've had a comedy recession.
[17:35.81]No, we didn't.
[17:37.01]Take a look at the log.
[17:37.67]Alright, so we have to go to work.
[17:39.87]This is Darcy's here.
[17:40.84]So here's like the different stores.
[17:42.40]Let's go.
[17:46.72]I'm Hugh.
[17:47.30]People call me the Sphinx of Darcy's.
[17:49.76]And you are?
[17:51.28]You look much better now.
[17:52.18]Welcome to Darcy's, the second-hand shop.
[17:55.28]I've been running this place for more than 30 years.
[17:58.16]As I told you, you are now my son Bob, who will inherit this store from me.
[18:04.84]That is why I picked you up from the beach.
[18:07.10]AVAC's been pestering me about this whereabouts and I needed to stand in for Bob.
[18:13.85]Yeah, after all that time, now they're looking for Bob.
[18:17.75]Oh, but Darcy, what if Bob comes back out of the blue?
[18:21.55]That is not going to happen.
[18:22.95]It's almost a decade since he left.
[18:25.29]By the way, this one here is Hugh.
[18:27.55]It's got a mouth on it, but it will be of help anyways.
[18:31.34]Huh.
[18:32.38]Now let's start discussing what you're going to do here.
[18:35.36]At here, you're going to both buy and sell things.
[18:39.92]And you must stay alert at all times.
[18:41.40]Every customer wants to get paid more money.
[18:44.42]That's because this place is off the grid from the citizen discourse data radar.
[18:49.24]Can I go home?
[18:50.20]What the fuck is this?
[18:51.93]I did that so I don't have to care about what the AVAC is doing in here.
[18:55.79]There are side effects, just like Hugh said.
[18:58.17]Customers all get so cocky as soon as they get in here.
[19:02.91]Anyway, for today, I'll teach you how to negotiate price when buying things.
[19:05.83]That's where to start.
[19:08.41]When buying things, it's really important to find a balance.
[19:12.55]It has to be a price that the customer can accept and that can still make you a profit when resold.
[19:19.09]You can't just start yelling out prices.
[19:20.73]Why not?
[19:23.01]You must appraise the item first.
[19:25.62]When it comes to appraising things, I use cards.
[19:28.86]Do the voice.
[19:29.48]Fuck.
[19:31.10]Customers introduce their items with cards.
[19:35.60]Gray card is base information, base price.
[19:38.37]It's a cup.
[19:40.35]If without a lack of fins or a long tongue.
[19:42.89]Okay, it's just a cup.
[19:44.93]Green card is detailed information and changes in price.
[19:49.75]So I get detailed info from like, so there's different rarities?
[19:55.66]So if it's a green card, it's like, okay, this is, could be, the prices could be changed a lot here.
[20:02.78]Oh, I forgot the blue cards.
[20:05.36]Green cards include objective information.
[20:07.86]On the other hand, blue cards are close to opinions.
[20:11.58]Just like how damaged, how popular or rare an item is.
[20:17.36]So this is people come in and they go, hey, this is worth like fucking 50 bucks and it's worth like 30.
[20:25.45]Sharing blue cards are like sharing your opinion at which customers may protest or get mad.
[20:31.31]Okay.
[20:34.97]Card slot.
[20:35.95]What the fuck is this?
[20:37.34]To share a card with a customer, you must insert the card in the card slot.
[20:41.46]The combination of cards yields a price.
[20:44.26]You can use it as a guideline while bargaining.
[20:47.52]Alright.
[20:50.64]So I have, like, the combination is the price of the actual item.
[20:54.06]Is it a card?
[20:54.54]It's not a card game.
[20:58.04]Don't worry too much about colors.
[20:59.94]For now, focus on bargaining the price based on the cards.
[21:04.10]Here, the gray card for this bag says bag.
[21:06.58]Bags are usually sold for 100 Vanoss.
[21:10.04]Let's say brand A is pretty high end, which means the price goes up by 200 V-Bucks.
[21:14.68]Fuck, whatever.
[21:15.13]I don't care.
[21:15.55]Mine is too many.
[21:16.74]Oh, Jesus.
[21:42.71]Decide how much to offer.
[21:44.19]At first, offer less than 70% of the guideline.
[21:48.71]Make an offer.
[21:49.47]Use the calculator to set its buying price and press offer.
[21:53.02]Say yes or no to a customer's offer.
[21:54.50]To say yes, press accept.
[21:55.54]If no, insert a new number and press offer.
[21:57.96]Oh fuck, we have to do math.
[22:02.68]So since this is your first offer, you can be a little bolder.
[22:05.48]Use the calculator on your own and try.
[22:07.89]Okay?
[22:08.61]So this is a bag.
[22:13.09]It's a regular bag and it's damaged, but it's from a decent brand and it's made of cowhide.
[22:17.87]Okay, I'll give you... Let me do the thing that they do in Pawn Stars.
[22:24.24]First of all, he goes... The best I can do is 40 bucks.
[22:29.54]And the guy comes in wanting like 500.
[22:30.70]He laughs again really loud.
[22:33.78]Okay, so let's just... Should we do $40? $40?
[22:42.22]right so let's just I'll give you I'll give you 150 bucks for it about 150. no this time we do as I said 190. what no you told me whatever the best like alright man the best I can do is 190. good but mostly customers won't accept your first offer instead they will make a counter offer like this how about 240.
[23:08.88]Man, I'm telling you.
[23:09.94]I got to put this on the shelf.
[23:11.32]I don't know who's going to buy this.
[23:12.58]I don't know who's going to come in here looking for one of these.
[23:14.06]Am I just going to sit on the shelf for a year?
[23:16.44]I don't know.
[23:23.15]That's a 210 sound.
[23:28.27]Well, alright.
[23:32.68]Yeah, let me call my buddy.
[23:33.94]He knows more about ancient artifacts than I do.
[23:37.40]We're gonna get him down here.
[23:42.54]I came to realize that I... That's Rick.
[23:45.61]Wait, you owe me 1500 bucks?
[23:48.21]Wait a minute.
[23:48.65]I just missed a huge, huge, huge fucking part of this.
[23:52.25]I'll take 115 V... What's going on?
[23:54.67]Not a good strategy to leave your debt unpaid for long.
[23:56.69]He just turned into like an evil character.
[23:58.41]What happened?
[24:02.01]And it's not just the debt that you should make money for.
[24:06.37]If you don't save money, you won't be treated as a human being after you become a Fixie.
[24:11.07]Strictly speaking, they are not human beings.
[24:14.01]Anyway, to be treated in a fair way even after you get fixed, you have to join the Fixie Pension Plan.
[24:19.71]To join it... Ah, I forgot again.
[24:23.49]The silly requirements.
[24:25.14]Just so we're clear, it's not because he's old, it's because there was more than one.
[24:28.32]As far as I remember, you join it by paying 10,000 V, or was it 30,000 V?
[24:35.46]I'll let you know the details next time.
[24:37.12]Making some money is the first thing to do anyways.
[24:39.70]Don't say anything you shouldn't when AVAC shows up.
[24:43.57]Just don't try to get involved with them.
[24:45.91]Good luck.
[24:47.55]Have a great day, my dearest Darcy.
[24:50.35]I think I understand a little bit.
[24:51.61]We'll figure it out.
[24:52.83]I was going to say, what's that guy's name?
[24:54.45]Rick?
[24:56.17]Dear citizens of Ajik City, good morning from the Association of Victims of Avarice Crimes.
[25:01.79]They broadcast in that manner every day.
[25:04.88]The Association will stay closer to you than ever until Fixer comes down again.
[25:10.30]Let's win victory in the war against greed together.
[25:12.76]Thank you.
[25:14.52]Peace.
[25:17.79]You're new here, aren't you?
[25:20.23]I'm gonna get scammed.
[25:21.27]Does Darcy have a problem in managing his part-time workers?
[25:24.10]The last guy was a nightmare.
[25:26.40]How good are you?
[25:27.10]Do you know how to name prices?
[25:29.84]Hold on, hold on.
[25:31.04]This is Bob.
[25:32.14]He's not just some part-time kid.
[25:33.42]He's Darcy's second son.
[25:36.86]You're Darcy's son?
[25:37.70]Then is Nari your daughter?
[25:40.22]No, you're talking about Bukku.
[25:43.23]This here is Bukku's younger brother, Bob.
[25:46.65]And Bob never gets intimidated by... At what point do I literally just leave?
[25:51.35]I could just walk out right now.
[25:52.37]His hands are shaking already.
[25:54.47]What do you got?
[25:54.85]Anyway, take a look at this.
[25:56.83]My daughter gave this to my ex-husband who used to be her father.
[26:00.18]Okay.
[26:02.86]Used to be.
[26:04.53]Would you please figure it out by yourself?
[26:06.33]Alright.
[26:06.97]People expect too much from me.
[26:09.55]I'm divorced.
[26:09.99]Living with that man meant nothing but a threat to my daughter and me.
[26:12.84]We always had to keep our heads down when AVAC's near.
[26:15.28]I heard he's doing some kind of one-man protest these days.
[26:18.70]He has some kind of hero complex to stand against AVAC.
[26:22.02]Anyway, what's written on there is removable.
[26:24.24]So don't worry about it.
[26:25.10]Bob, why don't you start at $35?
[26:27.92]Hold on.
[26:28.14]This is a trophy.
[26:36.18]It's made out of plastic.
[26:39.98]Do I do the Pawn Stars laugh?
[26:41.92]And say, man, it's made out of plastic.
[26:43.66]This is not made out of gold, man.
[26:46.02]Uh... I would take this down and recycle it.
[26:49.25]That's what I would do.
[26:53.65]Okay, it's in perfect condition, though.
[26:56.41]But here's what I was going to say before.
[26:58.39]I, like, connect with Rick on a very spiritual level.
[27:01.18]Because I feel like that's half of these streams.
[27:05.02]Like, a situation...
[27:09.41]Even if it's not even that interesting, I just do it.
[27:12.85]I feel like I connect with him.
[27:16.87]Okay, so it's an increased price by 10%.
[27:22.03]So you want 60, but, I mean, it's made out of plastic.
[27:24.99]So, I'll give you... Well, this is a tutorial.
[27:29.66]How's 35 sound?
[27:33.05]Yeah, alright.
[27:33.59]Okay, that was easy.
[27:34.13]Right off the bat.
[27:35.83]Hey, you should get your hue repaired or something.
[27:38.61]Yours is so rude.
[27:39.47]Hues are supposed to talk back to its owner and aren't supposed to talk like that.
[27:42.76]They're supposed to talk back like that.
[27:44.14]What?
[27:45.32]Leave now, dear nosy customer.
[27:46.98]Alright, here's a tip for stock management.
[27:51.44]Have an inventory?
[27:56.53]All items you purchase go directly to the inventory.
[27:59.43]Items are listed here.
[28:00.49]Click each item to see its details.
[28:06.50]Cool.
[28:06.94]Wait, so can I sell that now?
[28:09.14]Why are you still here?
[28:15.62]Center right with a small triangle in it.
[28:18.48]Okay.
[28:19.16]Let's open the inventory.
[28:19.78]It's a button on the center right with a small triangle on it.
[28:24.45]Center right.
[28:25.05]Oh.
[28:26.85]Okay.
[28:27.33]Customers can't see what's inside here, so you have to place items on the showcase to sell them.
[28:31.47]Really?
[28:31.77]Oh, I'm gonna like this game.
[28:35.58]Oh, cool.
[28:36.08]This is cool.
[28:38.64]Display items to start selling.
[28:39.96]Display an item.
[28:40.68]Drag out an item from the inventory.
[28:42.74]Set a selling price.
[28:44.68]Click the item.
[28:45.40]Use the calculator to set a selling price and offer.
[28:47.77]So you put stuff off on the shelf.
[28:48.91]Okay, clear.
[28:51.47]Sold out.
[28:51.81]Sold items are marked as sold.
[28:53.19]Click X to empty the space.
[28:56.63]Okay, nice.
[28:59.29]Let's try placing what you just bought on the showcase to let customers see it.
[29:05.92]Okay.
[29:06.70]Appraised at $60, bought it for $35.
[29:08.36]And then where does it- drag it out somewhere?
[29:12.99]Where should I put it?
[29:13.51]Go to the showcase by clicking the button on the top left.
[29:18.91]Oh, okay.
[29:22.49]Now on sale.
[29:25.46]Special price $60?
[29:26.20]Should I put it- I mean, that's all I have.
[29:30.66]I don't have anything else.
[29:36.53]Is she gonna see that?
[29:37.27]She's gonna see that though, right?
[29:44.21]Good job.
[29:46.49]Are you having fun?
[29:47.19]She's so twisted.
[29:52.68]Whatever, there's one more thing to tell you, Bob.
[29:54.56]Whoa.
[29:58.12]Reputational card.
[29:59.60]Witness of Darcy's.
[30:03.03]This card will give you more advantages if you keep recommending valuable items.
[30:07.20]It will make customers trust your recommendation and encourage them to make a purchase.
[30:13.10]It will be automatically created and generate special price.
[30:16.80]When an item is put in this spot, like right in the middle, it's an exceptional selling price for recommended items.
[30:25.01]Shit, alright.
[30:25.73]So, I put that in the recommended and I can just say it's special price?
[30:37.19]Alright.
[30:38.47]The card Wittiness of Darcy's is one of the reputational cards.
[30:42.38]And Darcy will soon explain more about them.
[30:44.02]Alright.
[30:45.30]I feel like this is going to be really fun.
[30:47.18]I'm getting ready.
[30:49.02]What do you got?
[30:50.84]Alright, hi.
[30:52.10]I found this at home.
[30:53.00]How much can I get for it?
[30:56.22]Politics of Corporate Republic.
[30:57.36]Pretty sure you need more items now.
[30:58.62]Your showcase is close to empty.
[31:02.40]Okay.
[31:02.74]I just started.
[31:05.06]Alright, this shit is 56 bucks for this poster.
[31:08.12]Made out of recyclable paper.
[31:09.22]It's worth something a little bit.
[31:10.92]Although it's damaged as hell.
[31:13.17]I mean, this thing's damaged, man.
[31:14.67]I'm gonna have to offer you... How's, um... Okay, but most I can do is 20 bucks.
[31:25.36]Phew, so it turned out I got scared for nothing.
[31:29.90]20?
[31:30.26]What a great deal.
[31:35.18]Alright, I got a guy that can restore this shit.
[31:39.58]Is this?
[31:40.96]Yeah, the second hand shop.
[31:43.88]Sorry, I don't know anything about this town.
[31:46.70]Are you from another city?
[31:47.98]Have you escaped the fix rain?
[31:50.71]No, I was studying abroad and just came back to find my friend.
[31:53.99]And why are you here and not at your friend's house?
[31:58.05]There's an issue, and I'm here to ask you to keep this for me.
[32:02.08]I have to look around for a place to stay, but it's so heavy I'm afraid of AVAC.
[32:06.28]Is that a fucking moon rock?
[32:08.80]What is this?
[32:10.70]It is a moon rock.
[32:11.62]Have you been carrying this around the whole time?
[32:13.42]Yeah, it almost pulled out my arms.
[32:18.57]Oh, can I buy your arms?
[32:21.99]Anyway, I'll be here by this evening, so please wait for me and don't sell it.
[32:31.18]Floaties from other cities are so naive.
[32:35.34]You don't bring enough... Hey, excuse me, I'm looking for a moon rock.
[32:38.44]Do you have moon rocks?
[32:41.24]Hello and welcome to Ajak Ajak.
[32:43.08]We have two new stories coming up.
[32:47.04]Oh good, my TV at home is broken.
[32:49.99]First up, AVAC has launched their investigation into the fire at the Citizens Alliance Research Institute.
[32:55.45]The investigation is focused on finding if the fire was a mere unfortunate accident or an act of arson.
[33:02.80]It's clearly arson.
[33:04.22]Everyone was just waiting for someone to act.
[33:06.40]Whoever set that place on fire, I'm fully behind them.
[33:09.54]Next up, Professor Yongji Choi is staging a one-man protest against AVAC.
[33:15.99]He argues that the lack of clear standards for what are and are not avarice crimes will cause huge confusion.
[33:23.83]He also claims AVAC is interpreting the law however they please, leading to the incarceration of innocent citizens.
[33:33.11]I respect his courage, but don't you think he's all talk?
[33:37.45]Why can't he do something real like that arsonist?
[33:40.85]Do you want something?
[33:43.57]Can I help you?
[33:44.27]What are you doing in here?
[33:47.50]The rules must be ambiguous and penalties must be harsh to make the citizens behave.
[33:56.15]Sound's not working.
[33:56.97]I told Darcy to at least get a somewhat decent TV.
[34:00.15]Television.
[34:01.71]Citizens of Ajax City, the Bunker of Freedom is opening its doors once again.
[34:07.19]Bunker's opening again?
[34:08.15]It's gonna get loud around here.
[34:10.50]To let as many citizens as possible avoid fixed rain, we have lowered the entrance fee.
[34:16.44]The last time they said that, they charged $100,000.
[34:17.82]The new entrance fee is $25,000 per citizen.
[34:27.09]25,000!
[34:27.15]This is fantastic!
[34:28.65]I can hide from the Fixer with 25,000!
[34:31.99]Of course, only pure floaties can enter the bunker.
[34:36.42]That goes without saying.
[34:38.36]And ticket sales are scheduled to begin in five weeks.
[34:44.18]Until the day we meet, the Bunker of Freedom will be waiting for all of you.
[34:49.04]Citizen discourse data is still pretty quiet.
[34:51.22]Folks must be watching out on what they say because of AVAC.
[34:55.97]But the data record is blocked in here, right?
[34:59.25]This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.
[35:00.69]I won't need to stick to the silly fixie pension anymore.
[35:03.15]I'm not going to miss this.
[35:05.55]Got any moon rocks?
[35:07.54]He's all excited.
[35:09.26]AVAC is going to catch up to him before that.
[35:13.25]They didn't mention one thing.
[35:14.44]I'm curious if they'll charge you extra for bringing Hugh.
[35:18.38]Can you ask around for me, Bob?
[35:20.56]I want to go to the bunker, too.
[35:21.64]I don't want to be left with fixies.
[35:26.63]Hmm.
[35:28.01]Alright, hold on.
[35:30.67]Uh, what's this?
[35:32.89]Raise it 425.
[35:33.61]Is this a moon ship?
[35:35.58]It's in perfect condition.
[35:36.56]I can sell this for like 500 or 600 bucks.
[35:40.47]Appraised at 24.
[35:40.95]Alright, let's put this on the shelf.
[35:43.73]I'm selling it for 50.
[35:44.33]40.
[35:44.43]I'm not going to sell this.
[35:55.92]I'm a pawn shop.
[35:56.81]How would I... If you pawn something at a pawn shop, they don't just sell it immediately within an hour of you giving it to them.
[36:07.73]Everything going alright?
[36:09.37]Of course, Darcy.
[36:10.07]I'm here.
[36:14.93]Hang on.
[36:16.32]What's that rock in storage?
[36:17.36]Guess what, Darcy.
[36:19.26]That's a moon rock.
[36:21.04]Maybe you could make some money by selling it.
[36:23.06]Where'd you get that?
[36:23.72]A lady just came in and asked us to keep it for a few hours.
[36:29.05]You got her for free?
[36:31.35]Yeah, but she'll come back in a few hours.
[36:33.99]She's that stupid.
[36:35.53]If she's in a situation to ask you that, I'm pretty sure that she's being chased by AVAC.
[36:40.94]She won't make it.
[36:41.56]Why don't you just give it to me?
[36:44.52]I was actually in need of money.
[36:46.50]Come on.
[36:47.88]Oh, fuck.
[36:54.62]I can't do that.
[36:57.54]If I'm gonna have a reputable business, I need to be able to prove that I'm a reputable, you know, barterer.
[37:05.97]No, you can't take it.
[37:07.13]I'm sorry.
[37:07.65]That's not how it works.
[37:09.67]Oh my god, he's like about to kill me.
[37:11.23]Looks like I bought a stubborn one.
[37:13.09]Fine, fine.
[37:17.86]You can't hurt his feelings like that, Bob.
[37:22.31]It's company policy.
[37:23.59]What do you want me to say?
[37:24.95]Uh, hi.
[37:26.69]Uh, this is Darcy's, right?
[37:27.75]I thought I came into the wrong place.
[37:31.09]Uh, can I sell this?
[37:33.41]You like movies?
[37:34.35]I'm just wondering.
[37:34.93]What the fuck is this?
[37:37.85]Pretty sure you need more items now, or your showcase is close to empty.
[37:40.70]Uh, eight bucks will do, right?
[37:44.46]Eight bucks?
[37:45.80]I'll give you two bucks.
[37:48.11]Spinning top.
[37:50.59]It's just a top made of metal.
[37:53.45]Okay.
[37:57.10]Damaged.
[38:00.06]Eight bucks.
[38:01.20]Okay, you know what?
[38:02.32]I'll give you two dollars for it.
[38:07.06]Well, I think it deserves more.
[38:10.40]Can you tell me what made you say that?
[38:15.39]It's fucking damaged, man.
[38:18.39]How do I tell him?
[38:20.98]I say the shit's damaged, dude.
[38:24.88]No, two dollars.
[38:26.16]Two dollars is the best I can do.
[38:27.38]You're not getting more than that.
[38:29.65]You not want to compromise?
[38:30.81]You're not negotiating at all.
[38:32.81]I want to stop here.
[38:37.47]You brought in a top that's worth like two dollars.
[38:44.21]That- Why- Oh, it's you.
[38:47.02]Boku's little brother.
[38:48.26]Welcome back to Ajak City.
[38:50.96]Um, could you buy this off of me?
[38:53.22]This used to be my grandpa's favorite.
[38:55.06]Alright, what have we got?
[38:56.42]Old fucking Spider-Man volume.
[38:58.73]Thought you'd- Thought you're not accepting items anymore.
[39:00.61]I didn't see much stuff on the showcase.
[39:03.59]What do we got?
[39:05.91]I was expecting 29 bucks.
[39:07.35]Will it be okay with you?
[39:09.27]Oh, shit.
[39:11.74]That's actually very, very, very fair.
[39:14.42]That's incredibly fair.
[39:17.28]This shit's worth, like, 40.
[39:18.10]Okay.
[39:18.38]It's just really damaged, though.
[39:26.06]Alright.
[39:27.81]The World of Fantastic Adventures.
[39:30.37]By Count One Eye.
[39:31.71]Alright, I'll give you, um... That's 25.
[39:40.59]I think 27 is fair for both of us.
[39:45.59]27.
[39:45.77]I can.
[39:47.03]Best I can do.
[39:47.99]And I have to shake my head left and right.
[39:49.87]Best I can do is 26.
[39:51.96]That's the best I can do for 26.
[39:53.34]I can't do any more than that.
[39:55.88]Alright.
[39:56.34]Thank you.
[40:00.76]And both of my hands are on the glass.
[40:03.42]Flat.
[40:04.14]Leaning in.
[40:05.34]And it's like they're fucking glued.
[40:06.48]They don't come off.
[40:09.84]Wait, is this the person for the moon rock?
[40:13.00]Okay, yeah.
[40:13.72]Here, I got the moon rock for you.
[40:18.28]Of course.
[40:18.66]Here you go.
[40:22.19]Thanks for using.
[40:24.67]Enough.
[40:25.57]Thanks so much.
[40:26.07]I could tell by this sight, but you're a really nice person.
[40:27.69]I don't want to miss the dialogue here.
[40:29.35]Wish you have a great evening, then.
[40:30.79]Thank you.
[40:31.63]Have a nice day.
[40:34.46]And of course, she didn't even mention anything about a storage fee.
[40:36.88]Are we supposed to get a storage fee?
[40:42.68]Uh, hi.
[40:44.40]Uh, I'd like to sell this.
[40:47.00]On the back burner now, but this was once my daughter's favorite.
[40:50.59]Cute.
[40:50.83]Okay.
[40:53.47]I expected more stuff to be on the showcase, by the way.
[40:55.67]I, look, I, I, I've got three things.
[40:59.77]It roughly deserves about 41, doesn't it?
[41:03.78]It's baby goods.
[41:04.84]It's made out of wood.
[41:05.80]It's, but it's damaged.
[41:06.50]A little bit damaged.
[41:08.24]Hold on.
[41:08.64]I'll be right back.
[41:10.66]Hey, hey, hey, old man.
[41:12.41]Old man.
[41:12.77]You gotta take this one.
[41:16.84]Well, let me see what you have here.
[41:20.08]It looks like you have a baby good.
[41:23.53]And the thing about baby goods is babies use them.
[41:27.71]And babies are very cute and very, very, very nice.
[41:31.81]But unfortunately for me, it's made out of wood.
[41:36.33]And wood's not very good.
[41:37.99]It'll sell again.
[41:39.35]I don't think I'll be able to sell it.
[41:42.13]Chum, Chumlee, Chum, why don't you come over and take care of this?
[41:46.79]yeah okay uh I don't know what's your baby what's a baby and everybody everybody looks at the camera and everybody looks around at each other and like there's a bunch of zoom-ins uh I don't know man I'm just gonna go in my car hey god hey big horse come on out here hey what can I what's wrong what's happening
[42:12.14]My dad just told me it was going to be 45, I don't know, maybe 50.
[42:17.52]The best I can do, man, is 42.
[42:18.90]The best I can do is 42.
[42:29.39]Works for me.
[42:30.15]Alright.
[42:32.25]She wanted 41?
[42:35.09]Well, this is what happens.
[42:36.33]This is what happens when there's no communication.
[42:38.63]The four of them just run around the store and they just don't talk to each other.
[42:44.18]What?
[42:45.48]My ass.
[42:46.82]Why is she being so weird?
[42:49.68]Bob, this is Nary Joe.
[42:50.80]She's your fake niece.
[42:54.19]Alright, wait a minute.
[42:55.15]Everybody hold on.
[42:56.57]Back up.
[42:57.47]I gotta go to the back room.
[43:00.87]Okay, I've got this baby toy.
[43:02.93]Let's put it up there for $50.
[43:09.20]I got this book of smells.
[43:11.76]Raised it for- This is worth a lot.
[43:13.48]This one's 60.
[43:13.94]In fact, get the shit out of here.
[43:18.26]I'm putting this in here.
[43:21.24]This is recommended.
[43:21.98]60 bucks.
[43:23.77]Holy markup.
[43:24.63]It's not a markup.
[43:25.61]I had to restore it.
[43:26.39]Okay.
[43:28.83]Filling out the book here.
[43:29.83]You mean he's my fake uncle?
[43:32.15]Why would Bob leave Bluebird for a shithole like this in the first place?
[43:37.46]Hey you, if you're dreaming about inheriting this store, you'd better shut it off right now.
[43:42.92]Because there's no seat for a bogus son like you.
[43:45.10]And this place is supposed to be mine once Grandpa passes away.
[43:54.89]I'll cut the crap and buy off this cup.
[43:59.63]How do you keep bringing garbage like this?
[44:01.39]Do I have to explain?
[44:04.47]Why don't you sell your paintings?
[44:05.99]You have tons of them.
[44:08.67]Stop that joke.
[44:09.29]Do you think I'd sell my works to a place like this?
[44:12.27]Please think before you open your mouth.
[44:13.57]Sir, quit whining and take this cup for 90 bucks.
[44:17.78]You know that's a special deal.
[44:20.96]Okay.
[44:21.92]First of all.
[44:23.94]First of all, that's way too high.
[44:28.02]Second of all.
[44:30.88]A cup like that.
[44:33.42]I mean... Did... Did George Washington drink out of it?
[44:38.08]Because if I get a guy in here and we figure out, we do like a DNA test on it.
[44:41.86]And then I can sell it for like $20,000.
[44:43.44]But no.
[44:49.71]No way.
[44:50.11]$90.
[44:50.31]No way.
[44:50.91]$90 for a cup?
[44:51.43]No.
[44:52.95]Looks like someone needs a lesson.
[44:55.09]And let me make this one thing clear.
[44:57.89]George Washington did drink out of this.
[44:59.64]If you ever ruin this soon to be inherited, I'll make you into a hue just like that thing.
[45:06.61]Stay strong.
[45:17.26]I'm fine.
[45:18.58]She even makes me want to run away sometimes.
[45:21.34]I'm doing just fine.
[45:24.60]Breaking news from Ajak Ajak.
[45:26.66]The Association of Victims of Avarice Crimes is still looking for four missing persons after the fire broke in the Citizens Alliance Research Institute.
[45:35.84]All missing are men in their 30s, including an accounting staff, Sang-Soo Ahn, Ok-Bae, and Ji-Soo Cha, who've been working as researchers at the Institute.
[45:46.85]An experimenting participant, Young Do, are missing as well.
[45:50.69]This is reporter Sa-Wei Oh for AGIC AGIC News.
[45:55.41]You don't need to avoid my eyes.
[45:56.75]I don't care if you're one of the four missing.
[45:59.04]Just don't cause any harm to my Darcy.
[46:03.73]I'd like to buy the Fantasia rulebook over there.
[46:05.87]How much is it?
[46:07.99]Oh shit, it's 60 bucks.
[46:10.68]Something must be wrong.
[46:11.52]Who buys this for 60 bucks?
[46:13.44]I'll buy it right away if it's 46.
[46:14.50]No.
[46:14.66]No.
[46:14.76]46! 55.
[46:36.24]Okay.
[46:37.30]I wasn't sure you'd accept my offer.
[46:38.62]Thanks.
[46:39.06]Wait, what?
[46:40.20]I said 55.
[46:42.04]Wait, what?
[46:43.10]I said 55.
[46:43.58]I said 55.
[46:44.76]I said 55 accept.
[46:47.42]55.
[46:48.48]What the fuck?
[46:50.32]How was your first day?
[46:51.26]I didn't want to.
[46:52.50]I wanted to.
[46:53.24]Oh, I didn't hit offer.
[46:54.16]But what the fuck?
[46:55.76]Okay.
[46:59.45]I was thinking 55, but said, yes, take.
[47:03.24]Next Monday, AVAC will come by to check your identification.
[47:05.66]You have to make a fake ID by this Friday.
[47:08.94]Fortunately, there's a man who can make fake IDs.
[47:11.10]He lives in the same building as you, right above your room.
[47:14.43]Visit him after work, since he sleeps during the daytime and works at night.
[47:17.57]He will ask for $800.
[47:19.73]What?
[47:21.55]If you can afford it, visit him right after this.
[47:25.44]What if I fail to get a fake ID?
[47:27.78]Well, then the AAPAC will come to take my fake son away.
[47:32.92]Oh, is it closed?
[47:34.58]Yeah, we're closed.
[47:35.30]Then what about this gentleman here?
[47:38.46]He's the owner.
[47:41.61]Oh, is he?
[47:42.29]By the way, is this the theme here?
[47:43.97]Theme?
[47:46.07]What theme?
[47:47.37]To wrap up an employee's face to make him look like a mummy?
[47:50.87]Or was he just caught in terrible turmoil?
[47:55.51]Nah, just kidding.
[47:56.73]Have a good evening, then.
[48:02.24]Did he hear us?
[48:03.82]I don't think so, but let's not forget about him.
[48:07.23]Anyway, just make sure to get your fake ID by this Friday.
[48:09.67]It's for yourself.
[48:11.47]I wrote it on the calendar.
[48:13.95]Small one behind me.
[48:20.01]Oh, that's why it's called that.
[48:20.81]Because the rain, like, fucks us all up and controls us or something.
[48:23.09]If you get to miss me, Deadly, have a dream of me tonight.
[48:24.99]Toodaloo!
[48:25.19]Okay.
[48:25.37]I have a calendar?
[48:51.67]I get skills?
[48:52.45]I'm gonna get, like, skill points.
[48:56.33]More visitors will come to buy goods.
[48:58.11]Recommended items will gain more interest.
[49:00.44]Okay, so I'm, like, rank one.
[49:03.08]Likeability?
[49:03.84]Holy shit, there's a lot of stuff here.
[49:04.92]Okay.
[49:06.42]So, I gotta... Should I buy Friday, right?
[49:09.02]What's today's date?
[49:10.32]Do I have a calendar?
[49:21.81]Get it now.
[49:24.19]Go now.
[49:24.65]Do it now.

[49:27.23]Donate to the AVAC.
[49:28.95]Wait.
[49:29.58]Please donate 100 bucks.
[49:30.66]I don't want to donate that.
[49:31.62]No.
[49:31.84]Deny.
[49:33.98]Is there like multiple endings or something here?

[50:51.45]This is the Association of Victims of Avarice Crimes.
[50:56.46]You must pay your fine right now to prove your non-possession.
[51:01.10]Bunker of Freedom is a savior sent to us, or else I'll arrest you for crimes.
[51:05.95]No, I... I... What the fuck?

[51:46.23]I'll send it to you Monday morning.
[51:47.65]Check your inventory then.
[51:49.57]I'll have it.
[51:49.89]It'll be a purple booklet.
[51:52.07]That's your ID.
[51:53.21]Now go away.
[51:53.75]Okay.
[52:02.36]I think we gotta go down one more floor.
[52:07.12]Don't you need it by Friday?
[52:08.20]I think I just need it before they come.
[52:11.23]You know what the guy next door is like?
[52:17.73]Disposed.
[52:19.33]Moonrock.
[52:20.07]Sold.
[52:20.35]Plus a 76% return.
[52:23.29]Pretty good.
[52:23.61]Day one.
[52:24.79]A woman asked me to keep her moonrock for some hours.
[52:27.71]With $25,000, I can enter the bunker of freedom to avoid Fixer.
[52:31.04]Ticket sales must start in five weeks.
[52:34.36]Darcy wanted to get the moon rock, but I didn't give it to him.
[52:37.10]I returned the moon rock to the owner.
[52:38.42]I met Darcy's granddaughter, Nari.
[52:41.20]There are four people missing.
[52:42.20]One of them is probably me.
[52:43.16]I have to make a fake ID by this Friday.
[52:45.85]I bought the fake ID.
[52:47.41]It'll be my inventory Monday, and I paid $15 in interest to Darcy.
[52:50.71]Okay.
[52:55.23]Looks good.
[52:57.65]I'm to sleep.
[53:03.12]Look, I talk too fast.
[53:14.55]Okay, here we go.
[53:18.67]New day, I have 121 bucks.
[53:22.47]Here comes another jobless wimp.
[53:23.73]Don't walk around doing nothing, just stand somewhere like me.
[53:29.09]What you looking at?
[53:29.65]Get lost.
[53:35.15]Fuck you.
[53:36.29]That does look like Rick.
[53:38.87]I'm not gonna be the one to say it, that's gonna be you that says it.
[53:43.56]Because I will get raked.
[53:48.82]Wait, what's going on?
[53:50.62]This is mine.
[53:51.34]No, it's mine!
[53:57.79]I'll get raked over the coals, if I say it.
[54:01.93]Ow!
[54:03.43]I'm sorry.
[54:03.97]But an AVAC man was right there.
[54:06.53]He freaked me out.
[54:07.75]So that was an AVAC guy.
[54:20.20]rick I know I didn't I well I feel bad for anybody with the name rick in 2021 you know what I mean like because when people hear the word rick there's an immediate just visceral reaction to it like imagine if my name was Richard and people were like oh hey rick you guys would be like yeah tell him to stop saying that don't say that word rick
[54:55.64]Imagine if your name was Peter.
[54:57.34]That would be fine.
[55:05.80]Rage.
[55:06.30]Alright, let's go.
[55:12.66]Keep up the hard work, Bob.
[55:15.41]Thank you.
[55:16.79]Jeez, did you get to wash your face?
[55:18.27]You got sleep in your eyes, Bob.
[55:21.07]It would take one pound of pressure to just punch you in the head and blow up your brain.
[55:25.06]Just want to make sure you understand that.
[55:27.36]Are you Mr. Bob Joe?
[55:29.98]Are you here to take him away?
[55:31.32]This must be a record.
[55:33.50]We've received a report about you from your niece, Nary Joe.
[55:36.26]Nary?
[55:38.62]Not again.
[55:39.08]She said you were so obsessed with money and never looked after her.
[55:42.92]She also said she could prove it.
[55:45.71]So you either pay the fine right now to prove your non-possession spirit or get arrested for an adverse crime on the spot.
[55:54.75]What?
[55:55.87]What's going on?
[55:57.37]It's an emergency, Darcy.
[55:58.53]Bob's in danger.
[56:00.73]Mr. Joe, your granddaughter reported your son for crimes.
[56:06.26]Jesus.
[56:07.28]Let me take care of this.
[56:07.92]Can we talk outside?
[56:09.62]Ms.
[56:10.70]Sean Gong.
[56:13.14]Yes, Ms.
[56:13.82]Gong.
[56:19.05]This is where I go, stick my tongue out, and then I look over at the robot and I go, yeah!
[56:23.99]Anyway, morning, Bob.
[56:26.69]I made a song about you yesterday.
[56:27.80]It's called New Bob Bebop.
[56:30.58]Bob.
[56:31.28]Barabeep.
[56:32.06]New Bob Bop.
[56:33.12]It's the new Bob in town.
[56:34.50]Hugh Bobbop.
[56:36.04]Ah.
[56:37.12]That was great.
[56:39.08]Citizens of Ajak City, good morning from the Association of Victims of Crimes.
[56:43.09]They cut me off.
[56:44.83]Have a restrained and greed-free day.
[56:46.59]Thank you.
[56:51.06]You haven't run away yet.
[56:52.01]Now it's time for me to teach you how to check materials and damage levels.
[56:57.01]Let's look at that bag from yesterday.
[56:59.41]I said that this bag is in perfect condition, but before moving on to the next step, you should check for yourself by using a tool.
[57:07.22]Appraising an item.
[57:08.24]Oh, here we go.
[57:11.04]Customers sometimes lie.
[57:12.10]It means you have to check each card carefully they show you.
[57:15.90]Scrutinize an item.
[57:17.24]Use the tools in the manual.
[57:19.84]Oh boy.
[57:20.40]Insert cards from the manual.
[57:22.08]Pull out cards and insert them into the card slot.
[57:25.32]If you're wrong, customers mostly turn it down.
[57:28.80]What a slurp.
[57:29.59]I'm fine.
[57:33.01]Here's the toolbox.
[57:34.39]Click the damage assessor and move it onto the bag.
[57:37.07]It's in the second slot.
[57:39.65]Holy shit.
[57:40.15]This is going to get wacky.
[57:42.88]Here are the two essential tools.
[57:44.82]Damage Assessor and Material Magnifier.
[57:48.08]This measures damage level and this shows what texture it actually is.
[57:51.30]Okay.
[57:57.17]So you're saying that this is... It's not really perfect, right?
[58:06.35]And let's move on to its material.
[58:07.99]Click the material magnifier and move it onto the bag.
[58:10.47]Wait, so the happy face means perfect?
[58:13.35]What a stupid meter.
[58:14.55]This is a baby toy.
[58:16.27]I'm gonna look like an idiot.
[58:23.40]You see its material up close, but you can't tell what exactly it is for now.
[58:29.96]That's what you need this manual for.
[58:33.50]Oh my god.
[58:36.84]The manual complements your knowledge and expertise.
[58:39.12]You use keyboard shortcuts to navigate efficiently.
[58:41.34]It lets you move to each page, right?
[58:45.60]This is where you pull out cards from in the manual.
[58:48.26]Okay.
[58:48.84]In the text page.
[58:51.47]Go to the manual list in the manual.
[58:52.83]Go to the material list.
[58:54.75]Find out which material looks closest to what you just saw.
[58:58.11]Drag the one you found from the list to the slot.
[59:00.03]You'll be pulling out a card and putting it in the slot.
[59:04.17]It's this one.
[59:06.57]Right?
[59:09.15]Yeah, it's this one.
[59:11.95]Cowhide.
[59:13.49]Old leather.
[59:14.19]Cowhide.
[59:14.61]But now that's worth more money.
[59:16.07]It's cowhide.
[59:18.51]That's it.
[59:18.78]Did you see the card and the price change?
[59:21.54]Next, let's head to the condition page from the manual list.
[59:24.58]Use the damage assessor again and decide which damage level it falls into.
[59:33.08]This would be... I would say this would be slightly damaged.
[59:38.06]This is slightly damaged.
[59:40.50]It's not perfect condition.
[59:44.20]Ooh.
[59:45.58]Cards in the slot are tagged to items and shared with customers as you put things on the showcase.
[59:51.75]Oh.
[59:52.93]To let customers know this item is worth this much.
[59:56.39]Cards have to be accurate and concrete to earn trust of customers.
[60:01.95]And with trust you will be able to sell more, so keep in mind to use the tools in the manual.
[60:08.15]There's one more.
[60:08.85]God
[60:28.98]Okay.
[60:31.12]Reputational card two.
[60:32.16]This card gives you more advantages as your appraising skill improves.
[60:35.74]Customers will begin to buy items appraised by us without any doubt or even paying more.
[60:39.78]That's a reputation.
[60:41.74]Scam everyone.
[60:42.88]We'll only scam some people.
[60:44.32]I can't say we're going to scam everybody, but we'll scam whoever we need to.
[60:49.36]It doesn't show up from the beginning, but right after appraising and purchasing.
[60:52.12]So it's automatically attached to items after you appraise.
[60:55.44]So I have to get that skill up.
[60:59.16]You already mentioned the card Wittiness of Darcy's, right?
[61:03.56]Oops.
[61:04.76]Okay.
[61:06.04]These three cards indicate our store's reputation from three different views.
[61:10.45]These are special because they improve themselves along with you.
[61:13.53]The better you get, the more effective each card will be by driving the bargain to your advantage or encouraging customers to buy.
[61:20.69]Each card shows its detailed effects.
[61:22.83]Sick.
[61:24.67]You can check the effects and the progressions of each card here.
[61:27.39]Cool.
[61:30.26]Alright, I'm ready for day two.
[61:33.22]There's one last thing.
[61:34.68]I feel like this is E3.
[61:36.54]It'll be beyond your capacity for now, so I'll let you know about it later.
[61:40.82]It's a 10-second trailer for Elden Ring.
[61:43.54]For now, focus on improving your recommending skills.
[61:45.38]Okay.
[61:46.64]The AVAC must have scared you back then.
[61:48.97]Don't worry, I took care of it.
[61:51.89]They wanted you to either pay the fine or get fixed.
[61:55.12]Might sound like they're giving you a chance to make a choice, but they're not.
[61:58.86]The amount of fines is ridiculous, and most people can't afford to pay it.
[62:02.60]AVAC wants nothing but to make more Fixies, so try not to give them an excuse to get you.
[62:06.76]And please forgive my granddaughter.
[62:08.41]She may look a bit selfish, but she's just a poor kid.
[62:11.75]Both her father and her uncle left town when she was so young.
[62:14.89]Moreover, her father's now a Fixie.
[62:16.93]You can't imagine what she's going through.
[62:19.67]They always blame the parents if things go bad.
[62:23.16]Anyway, I should leave now.
[62:24.26]Wish you good luck.
[62:26.16]Well, you may turn the close sign over because you've been talking to me for six hours.
[62:31.88]This door is now closed.
[62:32.90]It's eight o'clock.
[62:36.12]Alright.
[62:37.06]Hey, how's it going?
[62:39.48]Are you a new owner of this place?
[62:41.85]Can you take a look at this?
[62:44.77]Already in the past, but still sad, isn't it?
[62:48.79]It's not good to have a large population.
[62:51.71]Okay, what do we got?
[62:53.11]Made out of paper.
[62:53.95]Let's fucking make sure it's made out of paper.
[62:58.07]Yeah, that's right here.
[62:59.01]What is that?
[63:01.44]Surgical steel.
[63:02.70]Oh, shit.
[63:03.46]Did I lie?
[63:04.16]Wait.
[63:04.88]This is made out of surgical steel.
[63:07.40]Am I scamming myself?
[63:12.49]No, I'm not.
[63:15.39]Am I scamming?
[63:16.99]That's...
[63:19.13]Stainless steel?
[63:20.79]What the fuck is this?
[63:25.25]Okay, this is fairly damaged.
[63:29.80]This is very damaged.
[63:33.96]It's made out of paper.
[63:36.70]Oh, I'm sorry.
[63:37.30]Hello, you dummy.
[63:39.80]What?
[63:44.36]Okay, it's paper.
[63:45.62]It is in fact made out of paper, but it was way more damage than you said it was.
[63:49.18]Liar.
[63:49.84]What's this?
[63:51.42]Oh, okay.
[63:52.76]Uh, best I can do, I'll give you, uh, I'll give you ten bucks for it.
[63:55.38]What do you think?
[64:04.60]I did miss some details, but still, you can't cut the price like that.
[64:09.60]Yes, I can.
[64:10.78]You literally came in here and you told me it was slightly damaged.
[64:12.97]It was incredibly damaged.
[64:16.53]I'll give you 11.
[64:16.85]Okay, yeah.
[64:21.13]There you go.
[64:22.65]That's how you make a fucking deal.
[64:28.86]I'd like to buy the trophy over there.
[64:30.30]How much is it?
[64:30.86]Uh, it is good.
[64:35.12]I expect it as much.
[64:35.88]I'll take it.
[64:36.54]Yeah, alright.
[64:38.39]60 bucks.
[64:38.77]Thank you.
[64:45.80]Just an ordinary bracelet.
[64:48.12]Made out of silver.
[64:49.50]Okay, wait, what's this?
[64:52.20]What's that made out of?
[64:52.78]Uh, bullshit.
[64:55.02]It's made out of paper.
[64:56.24]Liar.
[64:57.64]I'll give you a dollar.
[64:58.54]Alright, what is this?
[65:02.53]Hard to tell.
[65:04.39]Silicone?
[65:05.67]Is this silicone?
[65:10.73]What is this made out of?
[65:11.77]I think this is silicone.
[65:20.56]Silver.
[65:20.88]Is it actually silver?
[65:23.84]This thing's fucking damaged.
[65:29.53]It's really damaged.
[65:31.73]Yeah, it's damaged.
[65:32.69]Fairly.
[65:33.83]Can we let it pass as slightly damaged?
[65:36.89]Oh, wait a minute.
[65:38.25]Look up?
[65:38.73]Blind.
[65:39.07]What do you mean look up?
[65:39.65]Look up.
[65:39.85]What do you mean look up?
[65:44.12]Look up?
[65:49.97]Uh, slightly damaged.
[65:50.85]No, no, no.
[65:52.25]I'm sorry.
[65:52.67]You're making me nervous, Bob.
[65:57.27]It's a relief you know you shouldn't compromise on condition.
[65:59.78]No, I'm not going to pay two times the price of it.
[66:02.38]Alright, what about material?
[66:05.12]Because I don't think this is real.
[66:07.04]Maybe it is.
[66:19.01]Look up.
[66:20.47]What am I looking up at?
[66:21.37]Why is everybody saying look up?
[66:26.71]Use eyes, look up.
[66:27.92]What do you mean look up?
[66:29.16]Like, what do you mean?
[66:29.80]Like, scan his face?
[66:30.62]I don't know what you mean.
[66:31.16]What do you mean?
[66:31.58]Second row, look up.
[66:33.82]Yeah, but I don't... Okay, it's silver.
[66:35.76]It's silver.
[66:36.12]Alright, no, it's silver.
[66:36.78]Alright, fine.
[66:37.64]It's made of silver.
[66:38.42]Right, but I thought it could be this one or this one.
[66:40.63]I don't know.
[66:40.91]You guys are freaking me out.
[66:43.97]I'll give you $35 for it.
[66:50.71]I know you're generous, come on.
[66:51.81]I'll give you 40.
[66:56.74]No.
[66:57.30]Yeah.
[67:01.20]Thank you.
[67:01.88]I didn't really think you'd give me more.
[67:04.29]Get out of here.
[67:04.93]Don't fucking come back.
[67:11.48]I'd like to buy the Babymobile over there.
[67:13.42]How much is it?
[67:13.94]Uh, that'll be, uh... Not what I expected as much.
[67:19.25]Oh, I put it up for 46.
[67:19.97]Yeah.
[67:20.95]Oh, I put it up for 50.
[67:21.81]Hell yeah.
[67:28.23]It's you again.
[67:29.99]How could you report New Bob to the AVAC?
[67:33.71]New Bob was so close to getting dragged away.
[67:37.27]I'd call it a welcome party.
[67:39.62]What brought you here today?
[67:41.10]What kind of garbage did you carry here?
[67:42.70]Knock it off or I'll throw you away to the stupid junk junk.
[67:49.35]Now look at this.
[67:50.31]Never seen such an amazing painting, have you?
[67:56.33]I don't know about this.
[67:58.69]Don't you know what amazing means?
[68:00.39]I can't buy this.
[68:05.02]Uh, yeah, this is cool.
[68:07.22]I wouldn't say that's cool.
[68:09.27]Right?
[68:11.33]Okay, then.
[68:11.79]You can take this for free.
[68:13.31]Oh.
[68:15.69]What, what, what, what?
[68:16.81]I want to examine this.
[68:19.17]At least you got an eye for painting.
[68:20.52]This is a stolen property.
[68:21.32]Yeah, this is a stolen property.
[68:24.42]She's trying to get me arrested.
[68:26.78]Yeah, I gotta check this thing for, like, fucking wires or something.
[68:29.44]Poster picked up in Bluebird on the showcase.
[68:31.38]How much is it?
[68:34.84]That'll be... That's too much for a used one, but okay.
[68:38.91]It's hard to get a new thing these days.
[68:40.25]40 bucks.
[68:42.59]I put it for... Oh, shit.
[68:44.41]You paid way too much for that.
[68:45.37]Alright, thanks.
[68:45.83]I kind of want to get rid of this thing.
[68:50.42]He's asking for a recommendation.
[68:56.12]In this case, find if the item that meets her requirements is in the inventory.
[68:59.20]I got it.
[69:01.32]Put it on the table.
[69:02.94]The customer will ask you the price, that's when you can speak out how much you want.
[69:06.29]If the customer is looking for an item that you don't have, or don't want to sell, just press the button decline on the calculator.
[69:12.71]Alright, yeah, I got a bracelet.
[69:16.63]I got one right here.
[69:19.40]I have, yes, I'm doing the tutorial.
[69:21.48]Look at that.
[69:23.42]This is what I wanted!
[69:24.78]How much is it?
[69:26.14]It is... $120.
[69:26.46]80 bucks.
[69:32.37]80?
[69:32.39]It's 75.
[69:32.59]75 dollars.
[69:34.13]How about 57?
[69:34.59]60.
[69:34.61]60.
[69:37.60]Why can I not offer 60?
[69:40.84]6?
[69:40.88]Can't offer it.
[70:04.25]Why can't I offer another one?
[70:06.49]Accept?
[70:06.97]65.
[70:09.53]I have to decline?
[70:13.09]Oh, decline.
[70:13.85]Sorry, let's stop here.
[70:21.21]No, no, what?
[70:22.05]No, I wanted to haggle.
[70:23.09]No, what the fuck?
[70:24.21]What?
[70:26.49]Why couldn't I say another price?
[70:29.28]Do you have paintings?
[70:31.22]Wha- I wanted to- I wanted to say another price!
[70:33.68]You only get one offer?
[70:37.32]Here, this is $450.
[70:38.12]I- stop, I- what is happening?
[70:39.56]This is how you do business.
[70:40.48]This is, uh, not really good.
[70:43.13]Let me show you my painting tomorrow.
[70:46.39]You may even cry seeing it.
[70:48.07]Fine, then come back with your painting tomorrow.
[70:49.57]What the fuck?
[70:50.43]I- Hold on, I need to put this on display.
[71:08.47]$75 for that.
[71:09.23]Is this locked?
[71:12.25]I don't even know what this is fucking worth.
[71:17.45]What is this worth?
[71:18.21]I don't know.
[71:18.51]I don't want to sell this.
[71:19.09]This is appraised at 13.
[71:23.43]Bought for 11.
[71:24.87]Put it up here for 20.
[71:26.01]25.
[71:29.55]I'm not going to put this on the... No.
[71:30.63]Because this is definitely like stolen property.
[71:32.36]She's trying to get me arrested.
[71:33.46]She made that really clear.
[71:34.22]Okay.
[71:38.76]She made that incredibly clear.
[71:41.17]It was my birthday present.
[71:42.05]Can you please tell me how much this is worth?
[71:46.17]Valueless.
[71:47.25]Let's find out.
[71:50.87]This shit is made out of... Paper.
[71:53.43]Okay.
[71:55.84]And... It's, uh... Slightly damaged.
[72:03.62]Slightly damaged.
[72:04.68]What?!
[72:04.98]I just made it worth more money!
[72:06.08]What?! !
[72:07.77]No!
[72:08.45]No, what?
[72:09.49]No, he just wanted me to... I thought I was just praising for him.
[72:13.83]I just boosted the price.
[72:14.93]No, he said, how much is this worth?
[72:17.65]It's garbage.
[72:18.53]Get rid of it.
[72:19.31]Are you serious?
[72:21.25]I should never have told him that.
[72:22.71]Okay, I get it now.
[72:24.01]I want to sell.
[72:24.59]I know, but he just said, hey, I got this for my birthday.
[72:27.69]What is this worth?
[72:28.61]He didn't say, hey, I got this for my birthday and I'm going to be a dick and sell it immediately to you right now.
[72:35.47]Somebody gives us a birthday present.
[72:40.20]Fuck.
[72:41.28]I don't want it.
[72:41.96]Let's just get out of here.
[72:43.74]Just go.
[72:44.40]Just go.
[72:45.18]Get out of here.
[72:45.64]Take your fucking thing and go sell it somewhere.
[72:52.36]Oh, hang it up.
[72:53.26]I don't know.
[72:53.66]Hi.
[73:01.67]Can I sell this?
[73:04.79]The showcase is nearly empty now.
[73:06.05]It's just a blip, right?
[73:07.03]Alright, how much is this thing actually fucking worth?
[73:10.16]What is this?
[73:10.46]This thing's made out of goddamn diamonds, I think.
[73:13.46]What is that?
[73:16.46]Okay, I've made it a glass.
[73:18.46]And this is, he says it's slightly damaged.
[73:20.78]If this is in perfect condition.
[73:22.64]So, I am not going to tell you that.
[73:24.30]I'm not going to fuck that up again.
[73:25.98]So, this is worth probably a lot.
[73:28.74]Because it's a, it's a Hoochoo Game Studios plaque.
[73:32.06]So, um.
[73:33.91]You know, by the way, this thing is fucking pretty damaged.
[73:35.71]I don't know if you knew that.
[73:39.05]Okay.
[73:42.29]You're a dishonest.
[73:45.24]You can't lie.
[73:46.12]Alright, here.
[73:48.10]Because this is worth like 100 bucks.
[73:50.76]He thinks it's slightly damaged.
[73:52.00]I'm going to say I'll give you 50 bucks for it.
[73:56.86]I guess you're very careful while appraising.
[74:00.08]I am.
[74:00.74]50 bucks.
[74:04.65]But I don't like to argue for a few more vanas.
[74:07.09]I'll take it.
[74:08.53]Thank you.
[74:09.91]Nice deck.
[74:15.46]Hi, how's your day?
[74:18.16]You're Darcy's son?
[74:18.98]The one who came back from Bluebird?
[74:21.83]I didn't scam anybody.
[74:23.29]Take a look at this.
[74:25.31]It's soft.
[74:25.85]It's good to sleep on.
[74:27.95]I expected more stuff to be on the showcase, by the way.
[74:32.31]Why do people keep buying things?
[74:33.45]Alright, what is this thing?
[74:38.00]It's made out of, like, pebbles?
[74:39.38]What is that?
[74:39.70]Oh, this is made out of velvet.
[74:42.28]Ooh, wait a minute here.
[74:43.30]Velvet.
[74:43.92]Velvet.
[74:46.18]Don't say that.
[74:46.80]Put stuff on the showcase.
[74:51.42]Hold on.
[74:55.00]Wait, you can't reappraise things afterwards.
[74:57.28]I can't reappraise this?
[75:04.58]This is just what it is?
[75:06.41]Oh, shit.
[75:06.93]I have to be honest.
[75:07.75]Okay, well, this is velvet.
[75:13.65]Be honest.
[75:14.59]Appraise it.
[75:18.24]I mean, it is slightly damaged.
[75:19.52]I think it's fairly damaged, by the way.
[75:25.05]No, you got that right.
[75:25.85]You just didn't know it was velvet.
[75:26.81]Alright, what do you want for it?
[75:27.63]93 bucks?
[75:32.43]I'll give you 40.
[75:32.85]Are you trying to play mind games with me?
[75:40.57]Want a 30% margin?
[75:41.73]Then let's stop wasting our time and settle on 60.
[75:48.81]64 That's actually that's not bad I'll take it I'm gonna sell this for 150 Insultingly low Dear citizens, we are announcing the day is at an end as we informed you yesterday it will be raining this evening
[76:15.18]We'd also like to inform you that the rain today is not fixer rain, but just rain.
[76:20.46]As you know, no umbrellas are allowed.
[76:22.51]Thanks for your cooperation.
[76:23.53]Let me put some shit on the shelves.
[76:25.39]Alright.
[76:28.41]This shit was appraised for 72.
[76:29.35]We're going to... 100 bucks for this one.
[76:34.81]Uh, that's up there.
[76:36.34]This thing, I'm going to... I'm going to get 125 bucks.
[76:42.44]I don't want to sell this.
[76:43.12]It's probably illegal.
[76:48.12]Alright, let's make some money.
[76:51.44]This is a scam shop.
[76:54.76]Um... If you think this is a scam shop, I would like for all of you to watch one episode of Shark Tank.
[77:01.99]And listen to when Kevin O'Leary leans in and goes, What are your margins?
[77:06.27]What are your margins?
[77:07.67]How much do you sell these for?
[77:09.35]And they say, we sell them for $29.99.
[77:11.91]And how much does it take to make them?
[77:13.09]$3.45. $3.45.
[77:17.20]Just watch one episode of Shark Tank.
[77:25.02]Of royalty.
[77:25.97]What I'm going to offer you is a 20% royalty on every single sale until my loan is paid back.
[77:30.77]And then in perpetuity, I'd like a fixed rate of 10%.
[77:34.49]Yeah, he always has the convoluted deals.
[77:39.16]Don't you feel like that Kevin O'Leary does not want to give anybody money?
[77:41.46]He just wants to, like, make people confused to a point where they pick Mark Cuban.
[77:46.35]And, like, Mark Cuban just has to buy all this shit.
[77:51.95]Like, it's always like Barbara.
[77:53.59]You know what I mean?
[77:54.73]Like, Barbara steps in and is like, you know what?
[77:56.93]This is what I'm going to do for you.
[77:58.54]I'm going to offer you 5% more than what you're asking.
[78:03.46]Barbara's always the one that buys the stuff.
[78:06.10]Based Barbara.
[78:06.88]You know, can I say that?
[78:10.86]That's an old joke.
[78:12.14]I've been going for 10 years, alright?
[78:13.62]We can do old stuff.
[78:14.52]Alright, that's fine.
[78:19.15]We're good.
[78:22.81]You may get soaked up to the bone.
[78:24.17]Be careful, Bob.
[78:24.77]Alright, so I can't... It's raining out.
[78:29.09]What the... Why is it raining?
[78:30.07]Is it fixed rain?
[78:32.67]No, relax.
[78:33.23]It's just ordinary rain.
[78:35.91]How would we tell the difference?
[78:45.83]Any money in the trash?
[78:49.54]Lucky me.
[78:50.06]What'd I get?
[78:51.94]Gotcha, lucky me.
[78:53.98]What'd I get?
[78:54.36]I didn't get anything.
[78:59.69]Run home.
[79:03.77]No, you don't run home in this scenario.
[79:06.53]Those of you that had a bus stop and you went, you walked to the bus stop, or if you were walking to work or whatever, if you get off at like the subway or whatever, this kind of rain, you see people sprinting around and panicking, but it's already over.
[79:18.75]If you stand in this for more than five seconds, it's over already.
[79:22.95]You might as well just walk normally.
[79:28.14]You're not gonna- Oh no, I gotta rush really fast to get out of this rain.
[79:32.38]Somebody dumped a bucket of water on your head already.
[79:34.94]It's over.
[79:35.29]Let's get running.
[79:44.23]Hey, and all running does is just makes it hit you in the eyes.
[79:46.65]Because if you run really fast, you're giving yourself like this perpetual forward motion.
[79:51.90]So the rain droplets actually hit inside your eyeballs.
[79:54.60]And you know, I don't know where that fucking rain's been.
[79:59.83]I don't want rain in my mouth.
[80:00.87]I don't want rain in my eyes.
[80:02.17]It gets like sucked up from the ground evaporation style and comes up with- I don't know what the fucking clouds are.
[80:05.73]I don't know what kind of dirt is up there.
[80:06.75]Where did that water come from?
[80:11.16]I don't want that fucking water in my mouth.
[80:16.56]What is this?
[80:19.88]Whether it's true or not, I want to stop.
[80:23.41]Even the rain noise sounds creepy.
[80:28.97]This bro is fucked.
[80:31.29]That's not how rainwater works.
[80:33.07]Um, yes.
[80:33.59]What do you mean?
[80:37.45]Freddy Dredd 25 community subs.
[80:39.25]What's up, Freddy?
[80:48.07]The Freddy Dredd, everybody.
[80:49.25]Ladies and gentlemen.
[80:51.57]I'm gonna sneeze.
[80:52.08]I just wanna make sure everyone's aware.
[80:54.46]And I'm gonna make sure I get it at the perfect... Ah!
[81:00.78]You know, I always think that that's really funny, but that's probably getting old.
[81:03.70]How?
[81:08.31]Okay.
[81:09.13]Is it more than five times?
[81:10.37]Is it old?
[81:11.87]What do you think?
[81:13.41]I think if we do that ten times, I have to stop doing it.
[81:18.77]Ten times is too much.
[81:19.65]Alright, I got 19% return on this.
[81:27.42]100% return on this.
[81:28.00]Cool.
[81:32.22]Oh, I picked up a book!
[81:34.20]What?
[81:36.78]That was in the trash.
[81:38.57]Nice.
[81:39.01]Cool.
[81:39.31]Alright.
[81:42.91]Alright.
[81:46.25]Got this painting.
[81:48.53]I don't like it.
[81:49.11]I don't want it.
[81:49.53]Looks good.
[81:57.08]ResidentSleeper.
[82:05.62]It's a crime book.
[82:07.72]Okay.
[82:09.23]I only have $90.
[82:09.73]This is bad.
[82:11.63]Should I do that kind of look around and look at more trash and stuff?
[82:19.67]I feel like I need more items.
[82:20.57]Should I go, like, take things?
[82:21.53]Oh, here are those kids again.
[82:26.83]Caught a cold?
[82:28.43]Yeah, you know it rained yesterday.
[82:29.71]Yeah.
[82:31.40]And I couldn't use an umbrella.
[82:32.40]And where's that fucking rain been?
[82:33.72]Thank you.
[82:35.64]Our kids are getting much smarter.
[82:37.70]Let's not go outside when it rains then.
[82:46.37]Rain doesn't give you a cold.
[82:51.35]Rain doesn't cause... I know, guys.
[82:54.69]You learn that in like fifth grade science.
[82:56.75]Maybe I can catch him by myself.
[83:07.75]Umbrellas, yes, umbrellas are not allowed because there's something in this world called Fix Rain.
[83:14.13]And if it touches you, apparently it fixes you and makes you like a, I don't know, like a government conspiracy or something.
[83:20.15]I don't know.
[83:20.57]We need more information from the story, Aaron.
[83:29.50]You're buying a Darcy's?
[83:30.40]Well, I won't stop you.
[83:31.30]What's wrong with Darcy's?
[83:38.09]Here are citizens of Ajax City.
[83:39.17]Good morning.
[83:40.75]Have a restrained and greed-free day.
[83:42.75]Thank you.
[83:43.15]I'd like to ask you for a favor.
[83:48.11]A man's going to show up with a statue sometime today.
[83:51.59]And he's going to insist about checking its material.
[83:54.96]Please tell him it's 24 karat gold.
[83:58.88]24 karat?
[83:59.42]My life depends on it.
[84:00.48]Please help me.
[84:08.10]Uh, the daily on the showcase, how much is that?
[84:12.08]Only $25.
[84:14.22]What?
[84:14.80]This is crazy.
[84:15.42]Who pays $25 for this?
[84:17.21]I'll buy it right away if it's $12.
[84:20.47]It's been appraised at $13.
[84:21.93]Now you pissed me off.
[84:23.63]No, no, what do you mean?
[84:24.67]Fuck off.
[84:25.33]I can't, that's your final, you're just gonna leave?
[84:27.68]No, I bought it for, how much did I buy this for?
[84:29.96]$11?
[84:29.98]I'm gonna get $1 return?
[84:40.19]No, someone will buy it.
[84:44.83]No.
[84:45.31]Get out of here.
[84:47.87]Well, it was not a bad offer.
[84:49.17]Yes, it was.
[84:50.31]The thing's worth $13.
[84:50.83]I had it appraised by me.
[84:53.56]I'm the smartest person in this room.
[84:57.74]Hi.
[84:58.30]I brought my painting.
[85:02.02]Look at this Criken.
[85:02.98]Doesn't it scare you?
[85:04.72]Let me be honest.
[85:05.32]What really scares me is your confidence.
[85:08.34]Sorry?
[85:08.62]Oh, nothing.
[85:09.33]Nothing.
[85:10.69]What do you say if I can give it to you as a gift?
[85:14.81]I think we may be friends someday.
[85:16.19]Can we refuse the gift?
[85:19.71]You're being funny.
[85:22.14]Trust me, people will soon line up to buy my paintings.
[85:24.62]They'll get crazy about the greatest artist, Boko Park.
[85:28.66]Until the day comes, I'll be staying in the Bunker of Freedom.
[85:32.74]And in the bunker, I'll practice and practice.
[85:35.04]You know, once I get into the bunker, nothing can take away my artistic spirit and talent.
[85:41.09]You need $25,000 to get in there.
[85:43.09]Got rich parents?
[85:45.01]Come on, look at the bright side.
[85:46.06]We still have enough time to make $25,000.
[85:48.02]Speaking of which, I gotta go and find some more part-time jobs.
[85:51.66]See you around.
[85:52.12]Can I appraise this painting?
[85:57.79]You don't have to be his friend, Bob.
[85:59.01]He doesn't have rich parents.
[86:02.49]Can I appraise this thing?
[86:05.39]Holy shit.
[86:07.23]Hey, let me see what this is made of.
[86:09.59]Oh, here we go.
[86:12.44]So this is, okay, the guy told me that his life depends on me telling him.
[86:16.28]Okay, this is perfect condition.
[86:23.92]Do I say perfect condition?
[86:29.00]What if, okay, so I, but I can't.
[86:32.77]Perfect condition.
[86:37.51]Just check the material.
[86:39.29]Oh, okay, fine.
[86:39.97]It's made out of fucking stone.
[86:46.68]But it is made out of gold.
[86:50.47]It is made out of gold.
[86:51.49]Why do I have to... This is not a lie.
[86:52.67]Didn't he say tell him?
[86:59.40]He said tell him it's made out of gold.
[87:00.91]It is made out of gold.
[87:11.86]You don't have to buy it.
[87:14.02]Well, then tell him that.
[87:15.16]Okay, it's made out of gold.
[87:19.32]Oh.
[87:22.39]Don't lie.
[87:23.03]Yeah, the guy, it's gold.
[87:24.09]The guy told me to say that.
[87:26.47]24 karat?
[87:27.77]That man got you two, didn't he?
[87:29.81]Stop lying to me.
[87:30.67]Is this really 24 karat gold?
[87:34.15]Um.
[87:37.02]Yeah.
[87:39.92]It is.
[87:42.70]Are you two scamming me?
[87:44.54]I know the truth.
[87:45.84]Tell me the truth before I report you along with him.
[87:50.32]Um... It's... I'm gonna lean in real close.
[87:58.46]I'm gonna say... It's 24 karat gold.
[88:04.47]And I'm gonna stare.
[88:04.89]It's 24 karat gold.
[88:11.18]Okay.
[88:12.22]You told me twice, so it's on you if you're wrong.
[88:18.81]Somebody wants to judge my appraisal.
[88:21.89]How fucking dare you?
[88:23.85]How much is that?
[88:24.41]Okay, here we go.
[88:26.52]It's 25 bucks.
[88:26.90]Something must be wrong.
[88:28.90]Who buys this for 25?
[88:30.10]I'll buy it right away if it's 14.
[88:31.22]Alright, that's a better return.
[88:33.90]Take it.
[88:34.99]Done.
[88:41.99]Check the next page.
[88:44.53]I don't think there is a next page on the materials.
[88:47.75]It was my birthday present.
[88:48.75]Can you please tell me how much this is worth?
[88:51.35]Bluebird ocarina.
[88:52.47]Alright.
[88:55.69]Well, judging by the cracks on it, I can tell you that this is absolutely made out of clay.
[89:01.91]No, it's made of clay.
[89:04.01]And then I can tell you, I was already aware of that.
[89:06.84]But I don't blame you.
[89:07.72]Okay.
[89:08.50]Okay.
[89:10.51]And this yeah, it's not I don't know it's fairly damaged oh It's fairly damaged not worthless oh It was never on my mind, thanks for telling me okay The shits worth a hundred and twenty nine bucks base And this is it refer to brands for more these arrows don't yeah, there's not the page two oh
[89:37.42]Alright, so what do you want for it?
[89:38.72]You want to pawn it or you want to sell it?
[89:40.25]I'll buy it for 40.
[89:47.93]Good, and it was so great to know every detail about this.
[89:50.17]Yep, you're welcome.
[89:51.35]I have no money left, by the way.
[89:52.61]I have to start selling shit.
[89:58.17]Uh, get this fucking out of here.
[89:59.14]Nobody wants it.
[90:03.38]Um, 75 bucks.
[90:05.38]This painting, though...
[90:08.21]Now, let me see detailed what this thing is.
[90:11.69]2D artwork.
[90:13.17]Failed price.
[90:14.77]Created... Created by feet, not hands.
[90:20.57]Wait, he made this with his feet?
[90:25.30]Failed piece.
[90:26.82]Slightly damaged, and the signature is unidentified.
[90:29.18]Alright, well... I'll sell it for $50,000.
[90:41.62]I've got this book too.
[90:43.24]Book Velvet Valueless.
[90:46.06]I can't appraise it in here.
[90:47.28]I just have to sell it.
[90:48.00]Alright, I'll sell it for 20.
[90:50.40]And then this, this little bird thing.
[90:55.88]Alright, appraise it.
[90:56.84]It says 65 bucks.
[91:01.80]Accept one.
[91:06.22]Hold, hold, hold.
[91:06.94]Don't sell the painting.
[91:07.74]Hold it.
[91:08.64]Hold the feet work.
[91:09.92]Hold it.
[91:10.30]Why?
[91:10.64]What?
[91:12.17]Don't sell the paintings.
[91:15.01]They're fucking worthless.
[91:17.97]They even told me this stuff was worthless.
[91:22.23]Hold it.
[91:22.63]Hold it.
[91:22.97]Hold the door.
[91:24.43]What is this?
[91:25.19]2017?
[91:25.23]Hold on, Bob.
[91:29.31]Did you eat up our money little by little?
[91:31.26]I think it's time to get a loan.
[91:33.58]Oh, we can't buy more stuff.
[91:35.42]You remember the button on the upper right corner?
[91:38.68]If you're too proud to get a loan, night dumpster diving is another option.
[91:45.13]How much is the picked up book?
[91:49.59]What?
[91:49.95]This is crazy.
[91:50.61]Who pays $20 for this?
[91:52.53]I'll buy it right away if it's $11.
[91:54.33]Fuck you.
[91:59.01]$15.
[91:59.92]No.
[92:00.54]Fine.
[92:00.96]Take it.
[92:01.28]I need money.
[92:09.40]I got it for free.
[92:10.28]That doesn't matter.
[92:12.85]If I went some, if I found like in a dumpster, an old like little figurine, I'm not going to just give it away for free.
[92:21.87]I'm going to try to sell it.
[92:22.79]But what if it was worth like $500?
[92:23.55]Thanks for not turning it down.
[92:30.46]This was never our decision, Darcy.
[92:34.53]She's just like her father.
[92:35.35]She's dreaming of becoming an artist, even in a situation like this.
[92:38.43]Without ADAC, both Nari and her father would have been following their dream by now.
[92:41.92]I could do anything for Nari to let her enter the bunker.
[92:45.12]So she won't get fixed as her father did.
[92:46.86]Nari's dad took off to Haga City a few years ago, saying he'd become a great painter.
[92:52.76]Haga City is where artists used to live in groups.
[92:55.84]But you know, fixed rain came down over all the country.
[92:59.85]Nari's trying to hide it, but she's going through a lot.
[93:04.14]Haven't you felt that she's not hiding it at all, Darcy?
[93:08.47]Anyway, I'll take the painting.
[93:12.59]Why?
[93:12.85]No, you don't have to give... Don't give me 500 bucks?
[93:16.45]What the fuck?
[93:23.96]Bugleberry voice.
[93:26.34]Oh, yes.
[93:29.14]This is how you know.
[93:30.31]It's Bugleberry's voice.
[93:31.65]100 bucks!
[93:35.15]Well, I like the price, but let me think for one more second.
[93:39.90]In my opinion, $93 is just about right.
[93:44.30]$95.
[93:45.47]Oh, you know what?
[93:46.25]Fine, I'll take it.
[93:51.03]Quite good at hitting a happy medium.
[93:59.02]Breaking news.
[94:00.66]More than 60 citizens are complaining of severe cold symptoms after yesterday's rain.
[94:05.01]One male citizen said, not allowed to use an umbrella.
[94:07.13]I was fully exposed to the rain.
[94:08.35]That's why I caught a cold.
[94:10.07]He also said, I asked the Association of Victims of Adverse Crimes if they could let the elderly in the week use umbrellas.
[94:16.11]The association, however, is not responding yet to his request.
[94:19.76]This is reporter Saiwo Oh for AJIC AJIC News.
[94:26.60]Can you take a good look at this?
[94:28.99]What?
[94:29.17]Yes I am.
[94:29.97]Fine, no worries.
[94:30.31]What are you talking about?
[94:31.07]I'm not ready for this.
[94:31.65]Unplug this guy.
[95:00.57]What was that all about?
[95:01.29]A common silver bracelet on the showcase.
[95:05.62]How much is that?
[95:07.60]75.
[95:07.62]Something must be wrong.
[95:10.36]Who buys this for 75?
[95:12.21]I'll buy it right away if it's 42.
[95:13.21]No.
[95:27.31]It was a bad offer because it's not even worth the base price.
[95:30.23]Get out of here.
[95:33.89]What do you want?
[95:35.16]Is my painting sold out?
[95:37.28]You got a bigger problem, Nari.
[95:39.34]Your nemesis has arrived.
[95:41.68]My nemesis?
[95:43.02]Yesterday we showed your painting to a guy and he said the painting is hideous.
[95:48.08]And he showed us this.
[95:49.02]His painting.
[95:50.93]Why am I not haggling?
[95:51.71]Because it's not an option if they come in and demand a price.
[95:54.11]I cannot haggle.
[95:55.57]It's only an option, I think, when you appraise.
[95:57.27]There's a shitty name on this.
[95:59.57]Is his name Boco Park?
[96:02.62]Alright, bye.
[96:07.42]During the whole time, I knew a nemesis was coming for her.
[96:09.60]How much is the hue doll?
[96:15.69]Oh, I was like, dude, take it for free.
[96:19.40]That's quite much for this.
[96:21.34]I buy it right away if it's 107.
[96:22.72]Holy smokes.
[96:28.30]I get a... Ooh.
[96:29.10]100.
[96:34.26]I'll take it.
[96:41.84]Alright.
[96:42.86]My pool of money is going back up.
[96:46.12]How's it going?
[96:48.03]CDD recorder is being blocked, right?
[96:51.83]Stop talking.
[96:52.51]Just take a look at this.
[96:55.69]Who's setting the reselling prices, by the way?
[96:57.65]They're higher than I expect.
[97:00.78]Me!
[97:03.46]Alright, this thing is, uh... First of all, let me tell you what you got here.
[97:06.42]You got a slightly damaged crown.
[97:13.00]Uh, it's a 400 bucks, okay.
[97:14.38]Thanks for being honest, yeah.
[97:18.20]Uh, it's also... What's it made out of?
[97:21.09]This thing is made out of... What you got here is you got a plat- Holy fuck, this is made out of platinum.
[97:32.33]Alright, but everyone's saying I'm stupid.
[97:34.37]Why did you tell them?
[97:35.55]Okay, listen.
[97:36.93]If I don't appraise this as platinum, I can't appraise it again.
[97:40.65]So I can't sell it for what it's actually worth because I cannot appraise it if I lie.
[97:44.92]I can't repraise.
[97:47.24]I can't appraise it again.
[97:49.76]So I either sell it for like $400.
[97:55.16]I'm talking back here.
[98:04.14]Yeah.
[98:04.78]Okay.
[98:06.86]Alright, what do you want for it?
[98:17.89]How about, uh, I'll give you $250.
[98:26.12]As a thank you for your hard work, I'll take your offer right away.
[98:28.88]Ooh.
[98:37.15]Hey, here's something urgent.
[98:38.73]Seems like the stabilizer is gonna be here soon.
[98:42.96]He thinks actual Bob came back from Bluebird.
[98:46.10]So he'll get you to take emotion mitigation treatment.
[98:49.66]Emotion mitigation treatment basically suppresses your emotions.
[98:52.77]It's so expensive that you may feel you might as well become a Fixie.
[98:56.23]Which is one of the reasons why some people desperately wait for Fix Reign.
[99:00.57]Anyhow, taking that treatment won't do any good for you.
[99:03.61]To tell the truth, it's pretty easy to avoid it.
[99:05.59]You have to tell yourself you're a Fixie and suppress all your emotions.
[99:10.55]Simply put, just act like a Fixie as best you can.
[99:13.16]What about Fixer?
[99:16.08]His brain must have been so messed up.
[99:17.56]Fixer is a drug to erase human emotions and desires.
[99:33.92]People who got fixed are Fixies.
[99:35.38]People who haven't are called Floaties.
[99:38.24]Huh.
[99:39.36]Fixies are nothing but the dead who still breathe.
[99:42.55]They're unresponsive to whatever happens around them.
[99:45.33]Even when their house gets robbed or when the AVAC takes away their family right before their very eyes, they just stand there and watch.
[99:51.36]No anger, no sadness, no desire, nothing.
[99:54.55]Almost every citizen living in this country, mind-licia, is already a Fixie, except for those in this city.
[100:01.32]It's because a year ago, the Association of Victims of Avarice rained Fixer all over the country, except Ajak City.
[100:09.68]We were lucky because the Citizens of Alliance Research Institute exploded a few weeks ago.
[100:14.43]That's how we became the last floaties in the whole country.
[100:19.49]Anyhow, when the stabilizer comes, pretend you're an emotionless zombie.
[100:23.67]And please don't say you don't know what zombie is.
[100:26.45]Even if he offends you or acts nice to you, don't move a muscle.
[100:30.52]There'll be only two choices left for floaties who can't hide their emotions in front of stabilizers.
[100:35.26]Either get emotion mitigation treatment, or be labeled an avarice criminal.
[100:39.82]I've seen countless people going bankrupt trying to afford emotion mitigation treatment.
[100:44.63]Once you're labeled as one of these criminals, otherwise, the AVAC will arrest you and fix you.
[100:51.69]So never let the stabilizer get to you.
[100:53.76]How will I know who the stabilizer is?
[100:55.04]Does he say I'm the stabilizer?
[100:56.24]We have more shit to put on the shelves.
[101:00.50]Hold on.
[101:01.84]Common silver bracelet.
[101:02.88]Yeah.
[101:03.24]How much is it?
[101:05.24]75 bucks.
[101:10.13]Buy it right away.
[101:10.87]It's 43.
[101:10.99]Fuck off.
[101:16.67]Fine, just get rid of this dumb thing.
[101:18.31]I've overpaid for it.
[101:19.80]What's this?
[101:28.48]Since I'm not an expert, I don't know its details, but you're an expert.
[101:32.18]You can find something, right?
[101:35.30]Super soft cat bed.
[101:36.54]Hold on.
[101:39.91]I gotta get this.
[101:41.25]Take this stuff out of the window.
[101:44.07]shit's going right here and it's I'm selling this for 750 right no 600 how much they sell this for the mask the smart mask 600 I think 600 is fair yeah that's fair
[102:10.81]Alright, it's pet goods.
[102:12.19]Made out of cotton.
[102:12.85]It's valueless.
[102:13.41]Let's find out.
[102:13.89]What do you got?
[102:15.69]First of all, by the way, buddy, this is velvet.
[102:17.98]So, not valueless.
[102:20.94]So, you got here, you got a velvet pillow.
[102:26.96]Yeah, and let's take a look at the condition.
[102:30.24]It's slightly damaged.
[102:31.39]I don't think it's valueless.
[102:32.23]I think it's got some value to it.
[102:37.39]Yeah.
[102:38.59]So, uh, I'll give you a 35, 40, I'll give you 55.
[102:42.91]I'll give you 50 bucks.
[102:48.31]Thanks for finding me every detail so kindly.
[102:50.37]See?
[102:56.52]600 is less than a 25% markup.
[102:58.26]You could have gone higher.
[102:58.94]Wait, whatever.
[102:59.78]Hey, it's you, the moon rock lady.
[103:04.22]After I saw you last time, I couldn't stop thinking about Jisoo, so I just dropped by.
[103:08.52]My friend Jisoo was such a good person.
[103:10.54]And really smart, too.
[103:11.52]He even got a job in the Citizens Alliance Research Institute.
[103:16.15]But I heard he had a hard time there.
[103:18.27]While doing all sorts of experiments on floaties and fixies.
[103:21.57]Must have been really painful for him to watch the experiments killing people and driving them crazy.
[103:26.58]By the way, here's a Mars rock.
[103:29.40]This one's worth five grand.
[103:30.70]Anyways, it was juicer that I was looking for.
[103:32.18]But after the fire in the Institute, he's gone missing.
[103:34.96]However, I will do anything to find him.
[103:39.11]I'm sure he's still alive.
[103:42.03]Anyway, it was great to see you again.
[103:43.73]Take care, then.
[103:44.23]Okay.
[103:45.95]Thanks for stopping by.
[103:47.67]I thought she was hitting on you.
[103:51.69]Um, well, thanks for coming by.
[103:54.74]Are you Darcy's son who came back in town?
[103:58.24]Bob, this is the stabilizer.
[104:01.95]He's from the Fair Tread Commission, and his role is to prevent and settle down the chaos of the city.
[104:08.47]According to the citizen discourse data, stabilizers usually create even more chaos.
[104:13.75]Knock it off.
[104:14.25]I'm not like those idiots.
[104:16.03]None of them can pick on floaties as skillfully as I do.
[104:20.34]Oh, so you're proud of it.
[104:22.66]By the way, why do you have your face wrapped up like that?
[104:24.76]Is that a problem?
[104:27.80]Of course.
[104:28.20]I need to see the face to decide whether he needs emotion mitigation treatment or not.
[104:33.86]Maybe I can put him under intensive care.
[104:36.22]He's been in Bluebird for a decade, huh?
[104:38.10]And the bell is on you?
[104:41.65]Shut up.
[104:41.93]It's time to see how good your master is at restraining his emotions.
[104:46.13]You better be completely honest.
[104:47.45]Question number one.
[104:49.91]If I say I need tons of money right now, are you going to ask me why?
[104:56.35]No.
[104:58.87]Don't be serious.
[104:59.57]It's just a test.
[105:01.52]Now, if I say I need $100 from you, are you going to give me that?
[105:06.80]No.
[105:09.36]No need to be so serious.
[105:10.22]I don't need your pocket money.
[105:13.59]Let's just stop this shit.
[105:15.01]I can take you straight to AVAC and give you a dose of fixer.
[105:20.48]Sure.
[105:23.92]Is that an easy decision for you, wacko?
[105:25.92]Are you upset now?
[105:30.22]No.
[105:32.54]But your voice is telling me different.
[105:35.17]Here, take this money and calm yourself, Don.
[105:39.19]Uh, yes.
[105:42.77]Nah, I'm kidding, of course.
[105:43.77]Ten bucks isn't enough.
[105:46.09]Why don't you work for me?
[105:47.08]Forget about your father and just follow my orders.
[105:52.81]What's emotionless?
[105:54.08]Yes.
[105:56.04]Right?
[105:56.44]Because no would be like, no!
[106:00.32]Yes.
[106:00.52]Are you just a yes man?
[106:04.86]You just want me to leave?
[106:07.21]No.
[106:08.79]Yes.
[106:09.29]I don't know.
[106:09.75]Should I say yes?
[106:11.53]I do want him to leave, but isn't saying no like, no, don't go.
[106:15.13]Yes, I want you to leave.
[106:17.40]But is yes more emotional, like, I want you to get out of here because you're annoying, or no, I want to keep you here because I like this conversation too much.
[106:26.12]Which one is correct?
[106:31.97]Yes implies want.
[106:34.09]Yes is more emotional.
[106:35.63]No, no.
[106:38.33]Here's your result.
[106:43.36]There were some points your emotion level exceeded the limit, but I'll cut you some slack for now.
[106:48.88]They don't want to give up this fun too soon.
[106:51.76]How evil.
[106:53.62]But I will keep watching you.
[106:55.16]Remember, I'm always ready to put you in the treatment process.
[107:00.20]Alright, passed.
[107:02.84]You're not a good actor, by the way.
[107:04.52]To look like a fixie, you have to loosen up and act like a zombie.
[107:07.62]That dull face of yours right now is what you really needed earlier.
[107:15.15]Uh, hi.
[107:17.03]Uh, could you buy this off me?
[107:21.85]You look very kind, by the way.
[107:23.13]Not like Darcy.
[107:24.79]Um, didn't I sell this to you?
[107:27.87]Wait, what did I get?
[107:29.65]I don't want this.
[107:33.32]It's made out of paper, yeah.
[107:36.98]It's pretty damaged.
[107:39.06]This is fairly damaged.
[107:40.72]I'm sorry.
[107:44.63]Fine, but you could've just looked over it.
[107:47.37]Nah, like, I don't fucking want this shit.
[107:54.97]I'll give you five dollars for it.
[107:56.33]You wanna leave a margin, like 30%, then I'm pretty sure nine will do.
[108:04.83]Seven.
[108:13.70]Settle for eight.
[108:18.48]It's $7.
[108:18.74]I'm not gonna be able to even sell this for more than like $12.
[108:22.85]Fine.
[108:35.55]Anyway, I made it.
[108:36.21]What do you mean I made it?
[108:37.97]That wasn't even a real newspaper article?
[108:44.55]I heard you were back, Bob!
[108:46.46]It's me, Hanja.
[108:47.52]Remember me?
[108:48.80]I must have run into you in the streets, but I didn't recognize you with that bandage.
[108:52.98]I never thought you'd come back.
[108:55.10]Vixie rain is going to start soon in the city.
[108:59.19]Actually, let's save the gloomy talk for later.
[109:01.19]It's been so long.
[109:02.85]I have something to return, too.
[109:04.73]I borrowed Darcy's year estimator last time.
[109:08.45]Took you long enough.
[109:10.55]Hehe.
[109:11.07]Tell Darcy I'm sorry for taking so long.
[109:13.99]And if you have anything that doesn't sell for over a week, feel free to give it to me.
[109:17.63]I still run my junkyard right downstairs, remember?
[109:20.85]Alright.
[109:26.52]Anyway, I got one more thing to tell you.
[109:28.22]Now you're operating this place instead of your father, so... You're a new member of the Badopolis Merchant Union now.
[109:35.22]I'm the president of the union, but we usually don't have a lot to do together.
[109:39.72]It's for a day, we gotta make one voice.
[109:44.03]Anyway, that's all for today.
[109:46.43]And you can come to my junk shop every morning if you have anything that's not sold for more than five days.
[109:51.25]It's right downstairs.
[109:54.82]Not at high prices, but I will be, uh, without, I'll buy it without arguing.
[109:59.00]Hey, unionize your workplace.
[110:00.20]Thanks for the 25.
[110:00.58]Get me nerdy subs.
[110:05.16]Picked the right time to do that.
[110:09.90]Drink water?
[110:10.42]I don't need to drink water.
[110:11.88]He needs to drink water.
[110:14.40]The association is announcing the day is at an end.
[110:16.64]The forecast for tomorrow is clear skies.
[110:18.94]Thanks for the 25 subs.
[110:22.66]I'm so tired.
[110:23.34]Head home now, Bob.
[110:24.44]Toodaloo.
[110:27.70]Oh, Monka.
[110:28.55]monkaW. monkaW. Okay.
[110:32.83]We got to look for stuff in the trash.
[110:35.87]I got to do more trash searching.
[110:37.61]Got it.
[110:38.03]Lucky me.
[110:38.51]What did I get?
[110:42.29]Oh, he threw it away.
[110:43.15]Wait, who threw that away?
[110:44.45]What is this?
[110:46.53]It's a hoverboard?
[110:51.97]Why is it valueless?
[111:03.14]This is the way to do it.
[111:03.82]Just find trash.
[111:04.56]20 bucks.
[111:06.02]Nice.
[111:06.20]I didn't have to do anything.
[111:13.08]Cash.
[111:15.04]55 bucks!
[111:15.44]What the fuck?
[111:19.47]Yeah, why would you just throw $50 in the trash?
[111:25.43]Nothing, okay.
[111:35.53]Your donation perfects Fixer.
[111:38.59]We need to find an antidote for Fixer.
[111:44.43]Those bandages are probably so gross right now.
[111:47.21]Probably.
[111:51.02]Last time she was right about what she foretold about my future.
[111:55.18]It was a $55 Fortnite card.
[112:00.32]So it's $20,000 to go to the bunker so you don't get rained on.
[112:15.66]Irma, you're going to play 12 minutes.
[112:18.32]Wait.
[112:18.50]You're going to come in with that painting tomorrow?
[112:28.45]I didn't have a plan, but... Worst deal of the day.
[112:35.73]Best deal of the day.
[112:36.79]Yeah, that was a good one.
[112:37.45]Whatever.
[112:38.99]Whatever.
[112:44.59]Okay, the Moonrock person showed up.
[112:46.99]Gotta paint.
[112:47.49]Yeah, alright, good.
[112:49.89]12 minutes sucks.
[112:50.81]It's too tedious.
[112:53.95]Um... I don't have a plan on playing it.
[112:56.35]But, I mean, I... Maybe... I have a lot of games that I've downloaded.
[113:06.60]And a lot of games I've bought that I'm kind of ready to play.
[113:09.14]And that's... I don't... I think maybe... Did I buy that?
[113:12.73]I don't remember.
[113:13.95]No, I did.
[113:16.77]You're gonna join the Fixie Patrol?
[113:18.49]That can't make you a human being.
[113:19.77]Whatever.
[113:27.01]What's up, Rick?
[113:36.91]When are you gonna play 2K2022?
[113:39.35]Which one?
[113:39.83]There's like a whole 2K franchise.
[113:42.67]There's like eight of them.
[113:44.79]Want to control your temper?
[113:45.67]Go get fixed.
[113:48.00]What are you... Why?
[113:49.34]What are you saying?
[113:50.12]Huh?
[113:56.74]Breath of the Wild waiting room.
[114:01.48]You know which store is collecting umbrellas?
[114:03.14]I don't know.
[114:10.16]Let's bet when Choi's gonna get hauled in.
[114:16.48]There are multiple 2K games.
[114:18.26]There are a lot of them, actually.
[114:21.28]Oh, I'm sorry.
[114:22.22]Will you come back some other day?
[114:23.30]I was just about to leave to find my son.
[114:27.73]Can I buy shit from here?
[114:32.45]Oh, nice.
[114:32.97]This is awesome.
[114:33.93]Wait.
[114:35.51]Oh, my babies.
[114:36.07]Today's the last day we can spend together.
[114:38.41]Oh, hi.
[114:38.69]Welcome to Scented.
[114:39.59]Which baby?
[114:40.19]I mean, which flower are you looking for?
[114:42.22]We have three flowers.
[114:43.30]Please try their scents as much as you want.
[114:47.52]Whoa.
[114:50.26]Price is 50 bucks.
[114:53.91]Oh me.
[114:54.93]She attracts people with her charming scent.
[115:00.29]His name is Ho Rong.
[115:02.23]He makes people feel better, more relaxed.
[115:03.99]The price is 50.
[115:04.83]I'll take it.
[115:05.22]Alright, see you later.
[115:11.04]There's junk junk.
[115:14.26]This I can sell junk.
[115:15.94]What about hidden?
[115:18.97]Undergoing remodeling.
[115:19.89]Repair.
[115:21.59]Under maintenance.
[115:23.70]Are these... I think all these places open up eventually.
[115:28.84]2K22 is actually coming out in 2022.
[115:30.22]Yeah, I know, because the last, like, four games they've made have been absolute fucking ass.
[115:36.26]It makes sense as to why they wouldn't want to do it again.
[115:37.76]Spend some more time on it.
[115:40.12]Stop just releasing fucking bloated shitty roster updates that nobody cares about.
[115:44.41]Did you get the year estimator back?
[115:51.89]Hunter brought it yesterday, but it was way past the due date.
[115:54.53]Anyhow, it's time to learn how to read the chronological table.
[115:59.81]Toy car.
[116:00.71]Click the year estimator and put it on this toy.
[116:04.14]The second slot to the right, okay?
[116:09.24]2062.
[116:10.56]Good.
[116:11.36]The number 2062 you just saw is the exact year the toy was created.
[116:18.86]Items that are related to historical events are worth a lot more.
[116:22.92]So this is the year.
[116:24.84]List of historical events in that year.
[116:26.74]And then pull up the card National Historical Value.
[116:31.08]Huh.
[116:33.94]Okay.
[116:36.94]Let's try it.
[116:39.16]So, this is the chronological table.
[116:42.08]It should be a historical event in the year 2062.
[116:43.74]Uh, 2062.
[116:52.21]The recovery period.
[116:54.09]But the year isn't all that counts.
[116:56.42]Take a look.
[116:57.98]This toy isn't really related to the historical event that happened in 2062.
[117:01.54]Vroom Vroom car.
[117:06.28]Fair Trade... Fair Trade Commission.
[117:09.02]This was also produced in 2062.
[117:10.28]Take a look at the news article.
[117:14.10]Beginning of a new era.
[117:16.26]Let's start together and run together, says the president.
[117:18.16]The government is planning to build a fair tread commission.
[117:20.90]This one seems to be related to the event in 2062.
[117:25.12]Okay.
[117:25.84]Then you can appreciate its historical value.
[117:28.89]Bald.
[117:29.47]What?
[117:30.49]Why are you writing that?
[117:33.45]Of all, like, bald.
[117:34.49]Yeah, I've been playing for two hours.
[117:36.49]You can write that now?
[117:37.19]Alright.
[117:39.45]National historical value.
[117:45.56]times two.
[117:51.18]This has historical value.
[117:53.52]Good.
[117:55.30]I don't have any of those at the moment, but those made before the 21st century will also come in.
[118:00.78]In that case, you can appreciate its archaeological value.
[118:04.65]Those who collect and research things lost during the war and the flood in 2000 will go crazy for it.
[118:09.79]So it's for your own good to use that card.
[118:13.85]Collectors even visit us to buy historical or archaeological items, and their budget is relatively high.
[118:19.35]It's also a good idea to wait for them looking for a higher margin.
[118:23.98]Hmm.
[118:25.04]By the way, the signature detector is still in repair, so I'll give it to you tomorrow.
[118:29.40]See you then.
[118:29.82]This is turning into, like, papers, please.
[118:32.54]But I like this game.
[118:34.18]This is cool.
[118:37.55]I'd like to buy the bluebird ocarina over there.
[118:39.53]How much is it?
[118:41.81]That'll be...
[118:44.12]That's too much for this.
[118:45.37]How about 60?
[118:51.69]Basher.
[118:55.63]Where were you in the world flooded in 2000?
[119:02.65]Everything on the display?
[119:03.52]What is this?
[119:04.94]Thanks for taking my side yesterday.
[119:07.84]I asked you to lie and say that that was 24 karat gold and you did, but I didn't.
[119:12.74]Lie?
[119:14.18]Yeah.
[119:14.80]Thanks to you, I was able to get rid of the creditor.
[119:18.28]What?
[119:19.08]That really was 24 karat gold.
[119:22.59]Really?
[119:24.73]Honestly, I really thought it was a fake.
[119:27.65]That thing was collecting dust in our attic for almost 20 years.
[119:30.03]That's why I was asking you to lie for me.
[119:35.44]Anyway, I still want to thank you.
[119:37.16]Please take this.
[119:39.54]Oh, shit.
[119:40.78]What do we got here?
[119:43.60]Take care.
[119:47.42]What do we got here?
[119:52.32]How much is the smart mask?
[119:56.06]600.
[119:57.32]Alright, there's no way you're overpricing your items.
[120:00.34]Oh, I could have sold it for way more.
[120:02.00]Fuck.
[120:04.24]Everybody was telling me not to do 750.
[120:06.28]I could have done 750.
[120:11.58]Alright, what do we got?
[120:14.71]Uh, this is new.
[120:15.35]What is it?
[120:17.19]Silver bracelet and it's damaged.
[120:20.95]What is it?
[120:21.97]50 bucks?
[120:22.27]I'll sell it for 60.
[120:25.20]What about this thing?
[120:27.28]Royals are coming.
[120:27.92]I can't reappraise this, so we're just gonna sell it.
[120:31.00]Sell for 15.
[120:33.08]Uh, this velvet pillow.
[120:34.58]Yeah.
[120:35.54]Sell this for 100.
[120:35.92]90.
[120:35.96]Let's be honest.
[120:39.89]Then this ring.
[120:42.47]Silver bracelet.
[120:43.37]Okay, let's sell it for 65.
[120:44.69]You know, whatever.
[120:45.15]Fuck it.
[120:48.04]Try praising again.
[120:48.80]I don't think you can.
[120:49.74]Uh, this hoverboard is like valueless.
[120:57.58]But I'm gonna hold on to it.
[120:59.14]And this painting is... I don't know.
[121:02.93]I'm gonna hold on to it.
[121:04.21]I've got enough stuff in the store.
[121:05.01]Whatever.
[121:07.93]Hey, take a look at this.
[121:10.33]The wanted poster.
[121:11.27]This should have some national historical value.
[121:14.67]First of all, lady, wait a minute.
[121:16.49]Is this made out of fucking solid diamond?
[121:20.73]Paper, okay.
[121:23.87]It's not in perfect condition, so I have to dock you a little bit of points on that one.
[121:27.76]It's slightly damaged.
[121:30.56]Mm-hmm.
[121:32.56]Slightly damaged.
[121:34.12]In fact, it's potential garbage.
[121:37.00]Alright, let's take a look.
[121:37.72]What year was this?
[121:38.26]2036?
[121:38.28]We got in the year 2036.
[121:38.76]There is no historical value here.
[121:45.80]2036.
[121:46.10]Sorry.
[121:51.12]No.
[121:55.03]I got nothing on 2036.
[121:55.57]2035 was the city fire.
[121:56.19]That was 2035.
[121:59.85]That wasn't 2036.
[122:00.55]Read the name of it.
[122:20.26]Arsonist of bru- Well, what?
[122:23.92]Alright, hold on.
[122:24.76]Wait, wait, wait.
[122:25.54]Okay, so brutal city fire.
[122:28.75]Massive fire.
[122:29.55]Alright, yes.
[122:30.07]This is worth some money.
[122:34.31]Did you check the year?
[122:36.61]Check the year once more.
[122:37.57]I was right!
[122:38.54]I told you!
[122:39.14]2036. 2036.
[122:48.04]No, there's no value here.
[122:49.78]I know you're mad, but... It's a fake.
[122:55.38]It's not real.
[122:57.74]Stop listening to chat.
[122:58.78]Yeah, I think I gotta stop doing that.
[123:02.71]I'll give you $25 for it.
[123:10.67]There weren't any significant events that happened in 2036.
[123:18.52]You're so fussy.
[123:19.90]Then it won't be worth anything, right?
[123:21.68]I won't sell it then.
[123:22.72]Well, then leave.
[123:23.28]I think it wasn't worth anything anyway.
[123:28.34]Good job, Bob.
[123:28.96]I offered money.
[123:35.30]Look!
[123:37.38]How do you think?
[123:41.16]I knew it would be breathtaking to you.
[123:44.92]I bought this so that you can show it to the shitty named guy.
[123:47.80]Oh yeah, I brought this so you can show this to Boko Park, okay?
[123:52.72]What a coincidence.
[123:56.55]Oh, look at how he painted his shirt.
[123:59.69]Just look at this painting and remember my name.
[124:01.63]It's Nary Joe, the soon-to-be greatest artist.
[124:04.93]Hmm.
[124:08.45]Still not enough for me.
[124:09.29]I don't see any happy soul from this.
[124:11.55]It just looks like a Fixies painting.
[124:14.33]What?! !
[124:16.29]Can I just call you Nary?
[124:18.62]Look, Nary.
[124:19.48]If you can't make yourself happy, your paintings can't get happy either.
[124:21.94]Cut that bullshit.
[124:24.56]Fixed rain is just around the corner and I'm broke while grandpa brought some rando into my future gallery.
[124:32.58]After my dad got fixed and now you are talking about happiness in front of me?
[124:36.08]If you don't think you deserve to be unhappy that much, why don't you go out and get fixed right now?
[124:43.08]Excuse me?
[124:44.28]Oh, God bless this man.
[124:47.20]I'm saying you have to do your best to stay happy while living as a floaty.
[124:51.14]Think of what you still have while Fixies don't.
[124:54.54]You can grab your brush back once you get to appreciate them.
[124:59.08]And after that, I promise I will be serious about your paintings.
[125:05.09]What?
[125:05.73]Oh, I was like, what happened?
[125:06.61]Why did he disappear?
[125:09.19]Don't look at me.
[125:13.69]Please rotate my body away from her if she ever comes in again.
[125:20.27]I got stuff on the shelf.
[125:23.17]One friend of mine gave this to me, so I don't know much about it.
[125:25.71]But I hope you will.
[125:27.90]Memorial towel.
[125:30.80]Alright.
[125:32.48]This is, uh... Uh... Would you consider that fairly damaged or slightly damaged?
[125:38.84]Probably slightly.
[125:42.92]Opening of the Fair Tread Commission and the first stabilizer contest.
[125:47.08]This might be historically, um, important.
[125:50.34]What's it made out of?
[125:52.60]Canvas?
[125:53.36]Yeah, you got that right.
[125:55.79]Wait, is that, that's not, is that canvas?
[125:58.01]What is it?
[125:58.33]No, it's not.
[125:59.37]This is cotton.
[126:03.43]It's cotton.
[126:06.81]Oh, it was never on my mind.
[126:07.89]Thanks for telling me.
[126:11.29]Piece of trash.
[126:12.95]It's not a piece... Alright, what about historical value?
[126:17.24]2062.
[126:17.60]The Fair Tread Commission.
[126:20.30]Oh yeah, right here.
[126:25.20]This is worth a lot.
[126:30.67]Really?
[126:31.43]I had no idea, thanks.
[126:32.47]Alright, well, what do you want?
[126:37.97]I'll give you, um...
[126:44.75]I'll give you 100 bucks.
[126:48.53]Come on, I know you're generous.
[126:54.20]Not even a counter offer?
[126:59.12]One... 101.
[126:59.30]120.
[127:00.80]Thanks for your try, but... Seriously?
[127:08.02]But you can make me a higher offer than that.
[127:09.34]I don't want to seem desperate, though.
[127:15.22]Alright.
[127:16.32]I can sell it for like $300 probably.
[127:24.38]$150.
[127:24.40]$150.
[127:24.70]That's it.
[127:26.50]Good.
[127:27.12]And it was so great to know every detail.
[127:28.55]Thank you.
[127:28.95]Alright.
[127:29.21]We're good.
[127:30.11]That'll be a good turnaround.
[127:31.83]Let's get that up there right now.
[127:33.05]I'd like to buy the 15-year-old newspaper over there.
[127:38.53]How much is it?
[127:40.74]Uh, it's 15 bucks.
[127:42.60]Good.
[127:42.88]I'll take it.
[127:43.26]Alright.
[127:43.68]Fucking good.
[127:44.56]Get the thing out of here.
[127:45.16]Get that out of my shop.
[127:45.92]Uh, I don't want this in here anymore.
[127:50.73]This thing, this thing is now more valuable.
[127:53.83]Uh, praise it 240.
[127:55.41]Let's put it up there for 350.
[128:00.14]That's good to me.
[128:01.14]Alright.
[128:05.05]This is the Association of Victims of Avarice Crimes.
[128:07.55]I have to tell you that this store has been appointed to collect umbrellas.
[128:13.05]From today, citizens will come here to sell their umbrellas.
[128:17.20]All you have to do is buy all the umbrellas and hand them over to the association.
[128:21.86]So don't ever try to resell the umbrellas to other citizens.
[128:24.80]If you do, you will get arrested for avarice crime.
[128:27.89]There's no reward, by the way.
[128:31.53]The association will reward you with 50 bucks for each umbrella.
[128:36.20]Back next Thursday to pick up the umbrellas.
[128:38.42]Until then, please follow the rule.
[128:41.34]Their annoyance added to the list.
[128:48.89]Super soft cat bed on the showcase.
[128:50.47]How much is that?
[128:52.15]It's only $90.
[128:52.79]Good.
[128:54.67]I expected as much.
[128:55.89]I'll take it.
[128:56.41]Alright.
[128:56.81]Nice.
[128:57.33]Easy.
[129:02.36]Simple.
[129:04.21]This should have some archaeological value, right?
[129:07.21]Windows 2000.
[129:11.49]Are you in the 21st century?
[129:12.73]Then you need this.
[129:14.71]What's it made out of?
[129:16.69]Paper.
[129:18.37]It's made out of paper.
[129:20.41]You're stating the obvious, right?
[129:21.73]Okay.
[129:23.01]How damaged is it?
[129:23.61]Yeah, it's slightly damaged.
[129:25.41]You already know that.
[129:25.99]Alright.
[129:27.45]The year 2000.
[129:32.94]Is it actually 2000?
[129:33.72]Yeah, it is.
[129:36.60]That would be archaeological value.
[129:37.96]That's three?
[129:44.58]It's kept for more than two days.
[129:45.78]It will also be unpopular.
[129:47.68]I'm sensitive.
[129:48.28]2000.
[129:51.61]Okay, yeah, this is it.
[129:52.65]That's an archaeological value.
[129:57.93]Check the year.
[129:59.35]I told you, items made in and after 2000 can't have... Oh, what?
[130:04.44]That's... Come on.
[130:07.84]Before the year 2000?
[130:08.96]There's no archaeological significance.
[130:15.24]Okay, whatever.
[130:19.60]Sorry, man.
[130:20.08]I'll give you $10 for it.
[130:29.91]Uh, things from two thou- Listen to my voice, hold on, everybody relax.
[130:33.87]Things from- I have Tom Hanks going- No, it's gone.
[130:39.31]When you get the rare Tom Hanks voice, you have to capitalize.
[130:46.03]You take a bite of food or a sip of a drink and you get that kind of trapped air bubble and you sound like Tom Hanks.
[130:52.26]Damn it.
[130:52.80]And then you talk for like two, three, four seconds and it's like, holy shit, I'm a completely different person, I'm Tom Hanks.
[130:57.74]And then it goes away.
[130:59.87]Sucks when you can't do it though.
[131:01.67]Alright, things from the 2000s don't count.
[131:07.41]So you're taking only things from the 1900s?
[131:09.75]Archaeological ones?
[131:10.69]How about this then?
[131:11.59]Alright, what the hell is this?
[131:14.49]It's made out of... Paper.
[131:22.93]Slightly damaged.
[131:24.43]Yeah, okay.
[131:24.99]Okay.
[131:27.37]1999.
[131:27.55]Y2K is coming.
[131:28.73]Are you ready?
[131:29.85]Yeah, that says value.
[131:32.19]Yeah.
[131:33.35]Sure.
[131:36.72]I knew it for sure, but that's good to hear.
[131:38.20]Yeah.
[131:38.54]Okay.
[131:38.88]So you want to sell it or you want to leave?
[131:45.02]I'll give you $75 for it.
[131:49.36]Seriously?
[131:49.84]But you can make me a higher offer than that.
[131:51.56]$90?
[131:51.58]$90. $90.
[131:59.97]Well, deal.
[132:05.11]Deal.
[132:07.21]Even 100.
[132:09.46]Sorry, I don't like it.
[132:10.52]Even 100.
[132:10.74]Even 100.
[132:10.92]Oh.
[132:11.02]Look, I'm taking a big risk here.
[132:21.13]It was my birthday present.
[132:21.99]Can you please tell me how much this is worth?
[132:24.73]Captivating cat collar.
[132:26.77]I've ruined it.
[132:27.65]Whatever.
[132:28.77]I'm taking a big risk here.
[132:30.15]Alright, what is this?
[132:34.96]Barely damaged.
[132:36.22]It's actually in pretty good condition.
[132:40.30]It's still slightly damaged though.
[132:41.88]That's not perfect.
[132:46.53]Oh, it's never on my mind.
[132:47.35]Thanks.
[132:47.85]Yep.
[132:48.57]And what's it made out of?
[132:50.31]Gravel.
[132:51.59]Sorry.
[132:51.87]It's worthless.
[132:55.01]Actually, it's made out of... This is made out of real leather.
[132:56.95]Is this real leather?
[133:07.45]Where is it?
[133:07.79]Right here.
[133:08.97]This is real leather.
[133:13.67]Really?
[133:14.27]Yeah, alright.
[133:15.03]And what year is it from?
[133:15.79]2078.
[133:16.15]No, no historical accuracy or anything.
[133:22.63]Alright, I'll give you 30 bucks for it.
[133:27.53]35.
[133:31.53]Alright, fine.
[133:32.01]I'll give you 50 bucks.
[133:32.77]Just fucking take it and leave.
[133:36.92]Good, and it was so great.
[133:37.76]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[133:38.52]Go, go, go, go, go.
[133:39.20]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[133:46.08]My ex gave it to me some time ago.
[133:47.52]I think you can kindly tell me how much this is worth.
[133:50.74]Ice cream shaped badge?
[133:53.90]And you think it's made out of platinum?
[133:59.65]Um, this is fairly damaged.
[134:04.13]Oh, that takes it down.
[134:07.27]Also, you think he said this is made out of platinum?
[134:10.52]Well, that's horseshit because it's made out of, literally, it's made out of metal.
[134:15.03]So, sorry to tell you, but you gotta... This is worthless.
[134:19.95]Really had no idea at all.
[134:20.99]Thanks.
[134:23.60]Okay, yeah.
[134:24.08]Sorry, it's base metal.
[134:25.32]It's fairly damaged.
[134:27.02]And is that any years of giving?
[134:28.46]Whoa, wait a minute.
[134:29.96]1987.
[134:29.98]That's archaeological value.
[134:36.87]Okay.
[134:37.07]I'll give you 30 bucks.
[134:47.81]Here we go.
[134:50.51]Yeah.
[134:55.45]Wait, I gotta put this stuff on the store shelf.
[134:58.10]Alright, what we got?
[134:58.62]This is sold.
[134:59.28]Sold.
[135:00.46]Uh, let's put this up for this, uh, $50.
[135:06.32]Put this one up for, no one's buying this expensive towel.
[135:09.22]85, I'll put it, not, 80 bucks?
[135:15.38]I think that's it, right?
[135:21.70]One friend of mine gave this to me, so I don't know much about it, but I hope you will.
[135:28.52]Um... These are... 200 bucks for eyeglasses?
[135:35.34]Oh, they are perfect.
[135:36.04]Okay.
[135:38.40]What's this material?
[135:40.92]Aluminum alloy.
[135:41.82]You got that right.
[135:42.88]Yeah, you got it right.
[135:44.80]What about, like, significance? 2071?
[135:50.23]No.
[135:50.41]Um, they're just expensive sunglasses.
[135:52.28]Uh, I don't want to buy sunglasses that's expensive.
[135:54.66]I'm gonna do, um... I mean, I don't want to... This is too expensive.
[136:00.66]I'll give you $190.
[136:00.98]Good.
[136:01.56]Alright, yeah.
[136:06.81]Yeah, okay.
[136:07.45]I'll sell them for $400.
[136:08.03]Okay.
[136:24.57]Remember, Jermbo, some people are already fixes.
[136:26.85]Oh, because they have no motion.
[136:28.67]Okay, I see what you mean.
[136:31.11]Alright, 80 bucks.
[136:31.85]I'll take it.
[136:32.19]Uh, announcing the end of the day.
[136:41.64]Okay.
[136:43.00]Sunny.
[136:43.50]Rainy in the afternoon.
[136:44.30]No umbrellas are allowed.
[136:46.54]Tomorrow's finally Friday.
[136:47.58]Just go straight home, Bob.
[136:48.64]That's how I can finish my day faster.
[136:56.24]Buy high, sell stupidly higher.
[136:58.02]What do you got?
[137:01.54]Anything in the trash?
[137:02.68]Yep.
[137:03.48]What was it?
[137:06.41]Stamp.
[137:07.23]Ooh.
[137:09.95]That's easy money right there.
[137:13.93]Please do a BRB.
[137:15.05]Um, in a minute.
[137:17.21]Nari's arguing with someone downstairs.
[137:18.99]Don't you think you have to do something?
[137:23.23]Didn't I buy a plant?
[137:27.16]Where's my plant?
[137:31.22]I bought a plant.
[137:35.32]It's on your desk.
[137:36.23]Oh, I wanted to sell it.
[137:46.45]It's just downstairs fighting with somebody.
[137:52.50]What's going on?
[137:56.13]I told you, he's not my uncle.
[137:57.87]What do you want from me?
[137:58.67]It's your fault you failed to sell.
[138:00.67]I know he's your uncle.
[138:04.57]He's right there.
[138:07.32]Leave me alone.
[138:12.16]What am I supposed to do about this?
[138:13.34]13 bucks?
[138:20.77]Eh, it's alright.
[138:27.57]Cash.
[138:28.19]50 bucks.
[138:28.41]Hell yeah.
[138:30.80]Go to the broken window?
[138:31.74]I will.
[138:32.00]I saw it.
[138:34.24]A smiley on your face.
[138:35.32]Is there anything good?
[138:37.96]I have no emotion.
[138:38.60]What are you talking about?
[138:42.42]14 bucks.
[138:42.68]Good.
[138:43.02]Alright.
[138:44.74]Broken window.
[138:50.24]There's a broken window.
[138:50.92]What happened?
[138:51.66]Junk guy.
[138:52.00]I thought this was a junk guy.
[138:55.32]Mass Effect 3 DLC waiting room.
[139:02.06]Let's end the day.
[139:02.60]Wait, what about you?
[139:03.16]No?
[139:04.22]Go up again.
[139:10.02]I missed a bin.
[139:10.81]Eh, it's alright.
[139:15.31]Did I do this one?
[139:16.79]I did.
[139:20.87]What happens if you donate money to that thing?
[139:24.88]My hair is a third eye for the future.
[139:29.17]You want to know your future?
[139:30.27]And I have to see your past as well.
[139:33.75]But your past is very blurred.
[139:36.04]In the past you were... Wait, before I tell you that.
[139:38.62]Keep the plain sunglasses in your store.
[139:42.22]Then I'll tell you your past and your future.
[139:44.14]Trying to cop the sunglasses?
[139:50.55]Those are full hundred bucks.
[139:51.57]Those are expensive.
[139:57.93]Should I do it?
[140:10.45]Oh, fuck off.
[140:12.35]Not me missing the chance.
[140:14.08]No, you're not getting any of my items.
[140:25.41]Oh, where has she gone again?
[140:36.07]Do it, do it.
[140:38.51]Let's use that donation machine more.
[140:39.93]It'll help us win favor.
[140:41.55]So wait, if I put money in that, will they leave me alone?
[140:47.09]That was a huge, that was a great sale.
[140:48.61]Okay, umbrellas that get picked up every Thursday.
[140:55.12]And I paid $15 in interest.
[141:03.58]Jerma, good evening.
[141:04.14]Why are you not funny right now?
[141:28.40]The man next door preschool humor Yeah, preschool humor cuz that was a preschool thing to say I
[141:40.00]That got him.
[141:52.54]It's true, but... But what?
[142:01.42]You're the pickle Rick of Twitch streamers.
[142:03.83]Stop saying that or I'm going to ban you.
[142:09.79]Not tired?
[142:10.81]Then why don't you hand over the shop to me?
[142:14.41]Get out of here.
[142:17.56]I'm sorry.
[142:17.86]Will you come back later?
[142:18.54]Fine.
[142:21.42]Don't expect too much.
[142:22.08]Darcy's can't show you anything special.
[142:31.69]Make that guy the new streamer.
[142:37.17]That is all toddlers.
[142:38.73]No, I'm just fucking kidding.
[142:40.09]Relax.
[142:41.49]Damn, it took decades to fix this.
[142:42.99]The signature detector.
[142:44.99]I put it on the far right side of the toolbox.
[142:48.44]Click the signature detector and put it on the ball.
[142:50.20]It will detect and show you an autograph.
[142:51.62]Okay.
[142:55.78]Good.
[142:57.88]Some items have a celebrity signature on them, and the type of the signature's owner affects the price.
[143:03.95]Okay.
[143:04.61]This tells you if there's a signature on it.
[143:07.61]And then check out the celebrities and their signatures list.
[143:11.47]Pull out the celebrity type cards.
[143:13.16]Alright.
[143:16.18]Artist, criminal, scholar.
[143:18.84]Okay.
[143:19.54]Unidentifiable fake autograph.
[143:24.08]Turn the page and find out the owner of the autograph you just saw.
[143:26.17]Okay.
[143:31.57]Oh dear.
[143:31.97]Alright, it's this one here.
[143:36.99]tennis player, and our first and last Olympic medalist.
[143:41.67]During practice, he threw into the sea a thousand tennis balls, which is considered very common.
[143:49.64]Okay, so this is very common.
[143:52.76]So, he used to write highly objective articles that people thought he equipped himself with a potato chip.
[144:00.92]You can see the list of types on the page I showed you earlier.
[144:02.88]Yeah, okay, so this is a common, this is, this is like, if it's this one, that's worth a lot, right?
[144:14.79]This is signed by... That's somebody else.
[144:16.45]What?
[144:21.13]Seungri knows tennis ball.
[144:24.96]This is his tennis ball.
[144:27.80]Yeah, this is his tennis ball.
[144:30.28]No, try again.
[144:30.94]What?
[144:32.26]This is not the... This is the wrong signature?
[144:33.94]This is not this person?
[144:43.23]Other page.
[144:48.58]read click on celebrity types okay he was a this is a he was a he was a tennis player it's not a fake autograph it's asking for the celebrity type not the celebrity name oh okay I thought it was asking like who like well what the or you're an athlete
[145:10.11]Signature of an athlete.
[145:11.61]Good.
[145:13.54]I literally just did all this.
[145:14.92]I don't need a tutorial.
[145:16.86]Card you can pull out.
[145:17.68]Yeah.
[145:18.16]I just did this.
[145:20.50]I was way ahead of the tutorial.
[145:28.18]Good job.
[145:31.78]If an autograph detected by the tool doesn't exist on the list or looks different, you can use the card unidentified or fake autograph.
[145:39.82]Please remember even a slight difference in a stroke can make an autograph unidentifiable.
[145:43.66]Okay, well this is gonna get weird.
[145:45.74]You would even have to look at the curves or serifs when it is cleverly forged.
[145:50.21]I can't speak.
[145:51.99]There's one more thing.
[145:54.59]The signatures list won't help when it comes to the type of great figure in world history.
[146:01.63]You know, I couldn't add every famous historical person to that list.
[146:06.72]And most of their belongings have a certificate.
[146:09.67]So when you want to use the card Great Figure in World History, use your knowledge on world history.
[146:16.03]Don't get so stressed about with it.
[146:17.99]I'm sure you won't need a thick history book.
[146:20.57]By the way, you can now unwrap the bandage around your face.
[146:23.15]And don't be disappointed even if your face looks different.
[146:26.73]Why was Bob's face... What?
[146:29.87]Oh, and did something happen to Nari?
[146:31.70]She looked a bit different somehow.
[146:33.14]I felt she's more motivated than usual.
[146:35.52]To me, it was great to see my granddaughter in a bright mood.
[146:37.60]Okay.
[146:38.68]Alright, see you later.
[146:45.02]Motivated?
[146:45.48]That means she's not a fixie.
[146:49.41]How much is the plain sunglasses?
[146:52.19]$400.
[146:52.27]This is crazy.
[146:53.19]$250 is the right price.
[146:54.09]Um... Uh-uh.
[146:55.47]Uh-uh.
[147:24.97]Uh, hi.
[147:26.49]You're new.
[147:27.15]Is Darcy busy now?
[147:29.40]Uh, can I sell this?
[147:31.52]I got this myself at that historic moment.
[147:33.34]Okay.
[147:34.94]You brought us something that you got for free.
[147:36.48]Okay.
[147:39.56]Feels comfy here.
[147:40.60]I heard some good stories about this store.
[147:42.09]Alright, first of all, it roughly deserves $124, doesn't it?
[147:47.35]Um, excuse me.
[147:48.49]We're not going to jump right to this.
[147:54.31]First of all, you're wrong on that.
[147:55.77]Fuck.
[147:59.23]Should've just said yes.
[148:00.39]But I have to appraise this stuff.
[148:01.49]I can't appraise it afterwards.
[148:06.10]Here's the thing.
[148:07.24]I can't appraise this after.
[148:09.00]A lot of you guys are missing that information.
[148:13.22]If I don't say it's slightly damaged, then I can't sell it for more money.
[148:17.74]Because you can't appraise things after.
[148:22.28]How many times do I have to say this before everybody understands what's going on?
[148:28.83]Okay, what is this made out of?
[148:31.63]Paper?
[148:31.89]I think this is paper.
[148:38.66]What the fuck is this?
[148:40.96]Stainless steel?
[148:41.88]I can't tell.
[148:45.94]What is this?
[148:46.34]Is it surgical steel?
[148:48.10]Silicone?
[148:49.96]It is silicone.
[148:50.56]Okay, it's down there.
[148:52.37]You got that right.
[148:53.09]What about the significance of the year?
[148:54.37]2074.
[148:55.21]Welcome to the first tracker challenge.
[149:00.81]I mean, this is... This is historic.
[149:03.17]Oh, this is... This is fucking worth a lot, by the way.

[149:39.03]Nobody's buying the fucking backpack or whatever the hell that is.
[149:42.63]Alright.
[149:43.81]Appraised at $660.
[149:44.47]This is $750.
[149:45.27]Bingo.
[149:46.89]That's fair.
[149:47.17]That's not a huge markup.
[149:48.25]$1,000 is way too much.
[149:48.73]I'll never sell it.
[150:04.45]This has been signed by a famous person.
[150:06.61]I know you'll give me a good price for it.
[150:07.85]Alright, first of all, slow down.
[150:08.95]What's it made out of?
[150:17.73]What is this?
[150:18.29]Plastic?
[150:20.11]Not perfect condition that's slightly damaged.
[150:21.75]It's a Tamagotchi.
[150:27.46]Alright, and what is it made out of?
[150:34.65]Plastic?
[150:35.13]Yeah, you got that right.
[150:36.03]Okay, what about the year?
[150:37.84]2072?
[150:40.22]Nothing really significant about it, but it was signed by somebody.
[150:42.68]Who exactly?
[150:43.44]Alright, who is that?
[150:50.02]This one here.
[150:50.58]Who's this?
[150:51.98]Celebrity list.
[150:54.14]That's accurate.
[150:54.66]A swimmer, so he's an athlete.
[150:55.70]Uh, he's an athlete.
[151:26.91]In that athlete's name.
[151:30.21]What?
[151:30.40]What happened?
[151:37.32]Oh, he's a criminal.
[151:38.18]Yeah, but he was an athlete.
[151:45.79]Do you know about him?
[151:46.89]How can you even consider him an athlete after being incarcerated?
[151:51.31]He's not an athlete anymore.
[151:52.53]But what?
[151:52.95]He signed it.
[151:53.41]He was an athlete.
[151:54.09]He was literally a fucking swimmer.
[152:06.72]Minus 50%.
[152:09.79]If it's displayed more than two days in a row, your attractiveness will decrease.
[152:13.59]Get this shit out of here.
[152:17.27]Alright, but that may change at any time.
[152:18.93]Get this out of here.
[152:25.23]Would have killed you to buy it.
[152:26.35]I don't want to hold it because I have government agencies coming in every Thursday to take umbrellas from me.
[152:31.14]I don't want to see that.
[152:35.37]How annoying the signatures of people are.
[152:36.91]Signatures of people with bad reputations and unpopularity make even the most popular and reputable brands' products less popular.
[152:42.25]Of course, it's good when unpopular things get popular thanks to signatures, but it's just annoying to see the value of an item going up and down just because it has a signature.
[152:56.33]I'm not buying that.
[152:56.89]I don't want it here.
[152:59.11]Alright, silver bracelet.
[153:00.33]65.
[153:01.61]Take a look.
[153:07.03]That's fair.
[153:07.69]I'll take it.
[153:11.29]That's fair.
[153:14.25]Why?
[153:14.49]It was a fair offer.
[153:20.53]I want to destroy the little desk robot.
[153:22.99]Why?
[153:25.37]I'd like to sell this here.
[153:27.75]I heard this store is in charge of collecting umbrellas.
[153:31.99]Please get hurry.
[153:33.25]I don't have much time.
[153:34.33]Well, you just tossed me 73.
[153:35.65]I'm really running out of time.
[153:38.72]Um, wait.
[153:41.16]What's the deal with this shit?
[153:42.44]I have to take them?
[153:45.00]Can I buy them?
[153:45.68]I don't understand how this works.
[153:50.39]I don't have much time.
[153:50.97]Stop, stop, stop.
[153:51.45]I don't get it.
[153:51.87]They sell for 50.
[153:52.59]50.
[153:53.31]60.
[154:00.61]I can't buy this for more than 50.
[154:07.79]Is this even a real umbrella?
[154:11.19]Steal.
[154:12.79]2079.
[154:12.83]Shhh.
[154:13.25]The Fix Rain Project.
[154:24.70]This is... This is relevant.
[154:26.42]No, wait.
[154:27.47]Don't.
[154:27.67]I don't want to need to know that.
[154:30.07]What do I do?
[154:32.27]Somebody signed it.
[154:33.49]No, no, come back, come back, come back, come back.
[154:34.83]I'll buy it.
[154:35.21]I don't understand.
[154:35.61]What did I just do?
[154:37.90]I said 50 and she said no!
[154:39.30]Did you buy this off of me?
[154:46.23]You can smell the fleecy creamy taste.
[154:49.04]Powder from- Okay, what the fuck?
[154:50.90]This is like old cheese?
[154:53.72]By the way, you look very generous, just like I heard.
[154:56.12]Shut up.
[154:57.22]I mean, thank you.
[154:59.16]Alright, what's this made out of?
[154:59.90]This is made out of fucking paper that's fine.
[155:01.58]2066.
[155:02.32]We got nothing relevant here.
[155:05.74]And was it signed by any celebrities or anything?
[155:08.72]It was.
[155:09.06]Alright, who signed this shit?
[155:12.34]Okay, who signed that?
[155:13.06]Who is that?
[155:15.36]You right here?
[155:15.80]Became a scholar- this is by, uh, Silicgel Lee.
[155:20.16]Became a scholar after his grandmother got Alzheimer's, which eventually led to the discovery of its cause and solution.
[155:24.57]Sh- I'm- I'm- I know, I know, I know.
[155:27.87]In later years, he put raincoats on the apes and said, you are not human, but nature.
[155:31.55]Okay, that's a celebrity.
[155:33.33]Who is he?
[155:33.95]A scholar?
[155:39.00]Signature of a scholar on here.
[155:41.96]Why is it worth less money?
[155:49.42]Okay.
[155:50.54]Alright, I'll give you, um... I'll give you $15 for it.
[155:58.11]Slightly more... $18.
[156:00.83]That's fair.
[156:05.87]Come on, you bought me an old box of cheese, dude.
[156:08.09]Take it.
[156:09.74]You'll give me more than... Oh my god, fucking $20 and get out of my store.
[156:14.40]I'll ask one last time.
[156:15.40]How about $19?
[156:16.30]Oh my god, fine.
[156:17.06]Just get the fuck out of my store.
[156:28.58]I'd like to buy the ice cream shaped badge over there.
[156:30.54]How much is it?
[156:30.98]50 bucks.
[156:34.67]Alright, there's no way you're overpricing.
[156:36.73]Thank you.
[156:37.49]I'm getting reputation bonuses for this.
[156:40.31]For being fair.
[156:45.11]It was fake cheese?
[156:47.08]Ooh, memorial towel on showcase.
[156:49.06]It's 350 bucks.
[156:50.34]What do you got?
[156:53.66]Yep.
[156:54.62]I'm looking for that one.
[156:56.04]Appraised.
[156:57.34]Perfectly.
[157:03.68]I want to buy a Tamago.
[157:05.02]Can I see one?
[157:09.29]I didn't buy it.
[157:09.87]The guy left.
[157:10.37]I don't have a Tamago.
[157:15.35]Give me $50 for it.
[157:20.39]I don't have a... No, I don't.
[157:22.69]I just told you I don't have one.
[157:23.75]What do we got?
[157:29.98]One friend of mine gave this to me, so I don't know much about it, but I hope you will.
[157:34.72]What is this?
[157:36.33]Sand to Jail.
[157:38.03]It's a gizmo made out of plastic and it's slightly damaged.
[157:40.57]Let's see if it's... That's very damaged, actually.
[157:46.63]It's made out of, um... That's not plastic.
[157:49.99]Yes, it is.
[157:52.53]2054.
[157:54.54]Second Scandal.
[157:56.50]This has got some significance.
[158:02.14]This is National Historical Value.
[158:05.85]Really?
[158:06.25]Yeah, it is.
[158:08.27]Also, it's been signed by none other than the current leader of the association.
[158:17.96]Does that make it worth less money?
[158:23.40]Is it like a national hero?
[158:28.78]Great figure in world's history, but I can't...
[158:33.99]What do I do for this?
[158:35.77]Politician?
[158:36.33]The very fourth of them are out of this country.
[158:40.33]Oh, fuck.
[158:42.78]That makes it worth less.
[158:44.40]Activist?
[158:50.68]By the way, I saw someone, like, an autograph written on it.
[158:52.90]Can you tell me whose it is?
[158:55.40]Isn't this, like, isn't the AVAC bad?
[158:56.96]I'm gonna say politician.
[159:09.35]Do I look like an idiot?
[159:11.33]What?
[159:13.31]How is that wrong?
[159:18.09]Is it activist?
[159:24.08]Great figure in world history.
[159:25.70]The real great figure is history.
[159:27.44]I mean, I think it would be like, I would have to be national hero in quotes.
[159:39.73]No?
[159:40.39]Don't be silly.
[159:43.11]So how's that not a politician?
[159:44.29]Or like a quote, like a national here, activist.
[159:48.73]A signature of an activist.
[159:51.61]Really?
[159:51.83]I had no idea.
[159:52.81]But I thought that this... But isn't it a politician?
[159:58.08]That's the current leader of the AVAC.
[159:59.60]How is that not a politician?
[160:03.56]Alright, well whatever.
[160:04.22]Thanks for coming.
[160:06.32]I'll give you $30 for it.
[160:15.38]AVAC is an activist group.
[160:16.98]Oh.
[160:21.48]What does AVAC stand for?
[160:25.58]Um... It, uh... The air conditioning heating units?
[160:32.19]Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning?
[160:35.85]Something must be wrong.
[160:36.53]Who buys this for $400?
[160:37.17]$240?
[160:37.19]Fuck.
[160:43.08]Um... I think I have to let the glasses go.
[160:54.41]Remember, I can't haggle to people that come in and want to buy.
[160:57.11]I can't haggle with them.
[161:01.26]It's not a feature of the game.
[161:02.28]And I feel like I have to say this every time somebody comes in the store.
[161:08.40]Alright, the friends of the four missing are now willing to pay money to find their missing friends.
[161:13.90]A person looking for Sang-Soo Ahn is a foreign businessman who has promised to pay $15,000 to find Mr. Ahn.
[161:20.75]The institute's director, Go-Nam Choi, is offering $8,000 to find one of his subordinates, Mr. Bok-Bae.
[161:28.41]Or another researcher, Ju-Soo Cha, one of his old friends, has promised $5,000 as a reward.
[161:33.36]Didn't somebody come here looking for Ju-Soo?
[161:35.62]The reward for the last missing person, Yong-Do, is relatively small.
[161:41.25]Find him.
[161:41.71]ABC is offering $1,000 in reward.
[161:43.69]Okay.
[161:46.85]This is reporter.
[161:47.57]Okay, so people... You can make money?
[161:50.49]If the honorariums were a thousand times as high as now, those would have caused me to do something very evil.
[161:56.05]You can haggle.
[161:58.00]Okay, I'm gonna... I want you to clip the next time that somebody comes in.
[162:02.18]I'm gonna make it like an exclamation point.
[162:05.86]Like a bot.
[162:08.06]Alright, the rain today is not fixed rain.
[162:09.86]It's regular rain.
[162:11.09]No umbrellas allowed.
[162:15.39]You may get soaked up to the bone.
[162:16.49]Be careful, Bob.
[162:23.59]You can haggle.
[162:26.16]I can't.
[162:27.62]Okay.
[162:28.32]I'm just going to stop responding to that statement because I can't physically press the button.
[162:53.53]Meltdown incoming.
[162:57.00]You can if you try really hard.
[162:58.82]MODS!
[163:15.97]Slow down.
[163:22.78]But if it is just that, what if it is that rain?
[163:24.58]And they've been lying to us.
[163:35.91]That was a big one.
[163:36.59]Should I just pay the loan off?
[163:39.71]When I have the money?
[163:41.77]What the fuck?
[163:42.31]The fire begins to spread everywhere.
[163:43.45]The smoke never gives up on befudding me.
[163:44.79]How can I get through that?
[163:45.63]What?
[163:48.53]Is my apartment, is my house on fire?
[163:51.86]Suddenly, I recall having almost lost my life-saving grandma next door from flames.
[163:56.64]I managed to save her, but her cat didn't make it.
[163:59.28]The flames roared just as much back then.
[164:04.64]Wow.
[164:08.50]Okay.
[164:12.94]Oh, I took the bandages off.
[164:21.48]Citizens of Agic City, this is the Association of Victims of Adverse Crimes.
[164:24.80]At the beginning of the week, we are happy to announce this to you.
[164:28.73]While cleaning up the Citizens Alliance Research Institute, which has been burnt down from a disastrous fire, we found core technical files of Fixerain.
[164:38.33]Files are being restored, and we're expecting to resume Fixerain in no more than a week in Agic City.
[164:44.52]We promise we will never let go of this valuable opportunity.
[164:49.14]Thank you.
[164:56.85]Have you caught a cold again?
[164:57.88]What's over here?
[165:04.63]Can't go that way.
[165:09.72]Is fixed rain dangerous?
[165:11.42]Um, all the, so far in the story that we know about fixed rain is, it's a way to, if it touches you, if you get fixed rain, or they call it a fixer, into your body, or into your bloodstream, I don't know, um, it takes away all your emotions and makes you just like a mindless android.
[165:29.73]So, they've been raining this on other places in the country, and making everybody just these slow, deluded, like, zombie people, right?
[165:38.43]And, apparently, they were going to do it here, in this, like, county, or this city, but the plant where they make it exploded.
[165:46.28]So they haven't been able to do it here, but they plan to resume very, very, very soon.
[165:49.50]Here we go.
[165:52.98]Don't push yourself so hard, this door is going to be mine eventually.
[166:02.30]mean oh cat come here gullion come play with me
[166:42.17]You know, did you hear how there was silence for like five seconds or so?
[166:48.35]Um, I was contemplating not doing that, but don't care.
[166:51.73]Alright, so the four missed me.
[166:53.89]Check out how much they promised for rewards.
[166:58.23]Mr. Bob Joe, you are supposed to submit your identification papers.
[167:02.94]Are you ready with the papers?
[167:06.84]This is mine, right?
[167:08.54]Identification papers.
[167:09.54]Okay, I'll sell it to you for $100.
[167:15.20]Let me check.
[167:18.96]Hmm.
[167:21.40]Alright.
[167:22.78]Good thing I remembered to do this.
[167:24.02]I would have forgot.
[167:24.60]What's wrong with the plant?
[167:30.74]Yeah.
[167:32.36]You're allergic to metal, aren't you?
[167:35.49]Don't try to deny it.
[167:36.53]No one can see through people like I do.
[167:39.24]A wooden accessory like this is just for people like you.
[167:41.84]Don't you agree?
[167:43.74]I can't put up with her sales tactic anymore.
[167:45.96]First, let's check its material, Bob.
[167:51.92]There's no other hue with better eyes than me.
[167:53.82]Alright, what's this made out of?
[167:55.47]It's like wavy.
[167:58.05]This is made out of wiki tannus tree.
[168:02.39]A brand that is so unpopular that even AVAC won't give a dang about it.
[168:08.27]Do I run the store or do you?
[168:11.25]Sometimes even leave out its slogan because all the... Hold on, you're talking too fast.
[168:21.18]So what?
[168:22.02]It means you have to check one more thing while appraising, Bob.
[168:24.82]It's brand.
[168:25.66]Oy.
[168:27.36]The brand of an item is a critical factor in the item's price.
[168:32.56]Click each brand logo to read its details.
[168:34.78]Is that the screamer guy but Starbucks?
[168:41.04]That's actually pretty cool.
[168:42.22]That's funny.
[168:42.60]Uh, you can pull out cards from some of the description parts.
[168:47.10]Some brands only use their original materials.
[168:49.16]Okay.
[168:51.20]If a slogan is missing or wrong, we can't say it's authentic.
[168:57.02]For the manual, go to the brand and find Everbrown.
[169:01.86]Okay.
[169:02.20]Materials, brands.
[169:03.44]It was brands.
[169:09.22]Or do brands...
[169:12.94]Alright, wild card for brands, uh, list of brands.
[169:18.76]So this is, uh, um, how do I hold it?
[169:31.31]X arcade.
[169:32.17]How do I do this?
[169:35.41]I don't see a brand on here.
[169:40.43]It's like a special material for the brand.
[169:44.57]Brand Eraser Everbrown.
[169:51.11]Eraser Everbrown.
[169:51.71]Oh, they're all like locked.
[169:52.63]That's what was like freaking me out.
[169:54.00]There it is.
[169:55.50]Yeah, I saw all like the locks and it freaked me out.
[169:59.80]Okay, Everbrown.
[170:05.76]It's taking so long.
[170:06.26]You better make it worth it.
[170:07.42]I'm doing the tutorial.
[170:08.33]Leave me alone, lady.
[170:10.54]Uh, folks, find what's below the description text for EverBrown.
[170:13.36]There's a thumbnail of a material that looks like the one you saw.
[170:17.70]Take out that card.
[170:19.62]This is this kind of wood.
[170:21.53]Signature wood from, uh, from this brand.
[170:24.67]Pull out a card from the sentence, most products of which crack in less than a year.
[170:28.21]Potential garbage.
[170:31.74]Okay.
[170:31.86]Okay.
[170:34.99]Potentially a piece of garbage.
[170:36.97]Okay, potential garbage.
[170:38.73]Good job.
[170:39.23]Lastly, pull up that card that says selling its products is a good way to lose reputation.
[170:45.72]This will hurt my reputation.
[170:50.48]What is this?
[170:50.80]An anger management test?
[170:52.78]I'm not selling.
[170:54.30]Okay, I think I understand it.
[170:58.08]Let it go, Bob.
[170:58.78]It was a piece of junk anyway.
[171:00.56]You just learned how to defend against brands with a negative image using the manual.
[171:07.42]Breaking news!
[171:09.12]The Association has announced a new fining policy.
[171:13.08]The new policy states that the fine amount adverse criminals should pay to prove their non-possession spirit and avoid arrest will be determined by how rich they are.
[171:21.35]For this, the AVAC came up with a new concept called Reunciation Rate.
[171:28.62]Reunciation Rate refers to the percentage of property that must be given up to prove non-possession spirit.
[171:34.83]If reunion, whatever that word is, is 10% and the property is 10,000, the final will be 1,000, which is 10% of the property.
[171:42.24]For all the citizens, the initial rate is set at 5%.
[171:44.48]The AVA official said the rate can be raised or lowered depending on the behavior of each citizen.
[171:50.36]Along with this, citizens who actively donate to the AVAC can now benefit more.
[171:55.15]From this evening, each citizen's donation amount will be checked on a weekly basis.
[171:58.59]Oh, fuck.
[172:01.61]So I get lower taxes if I donate to the AVAC.
[172:05.49]This is a reporter.
[172:06.93]Okay, there's a lot of new info here.
[172:11.11]You look familiar.
[172:12.65]I'm a member of the association.
[172:15.14]Just call me Merry.
[172:17.42]Don't worry.
[172:18.14]I'm not here to take you in.
[172:19.88]I have a favor to ask of you.
[172:22.96]I investigated these names on the list who are against fixed reign.
[172:27.62]He's an actor.
[172:28.24]He loves to be recognized and be the center of attention.
[172:31.52]He was outright against Fixed Reign, saying no one would recognize him or like him anymore after it.
[172:36.26]I have one complaint about this game.
[172:38.12]This is very annoying.
[172:39.02]I'm very annoyed by it.
[172:40.86]Next is Professor Yong Chi... I am not skipping.
[172:43.12]It's doing it on... I'm not clicking the arrow.
[172:45.26]You do know he is on a solo protest, don't you?
[172:47.82]I'd like to take... I want to be able to take the information in more.
[172:50.26]Don't just skip it for me.
[172:51.48]He's against every single one of the association policies, the most dangerous one.
[172:56.39]The last is Seon Gong, a member of our association.
[172:59.45]I believe you've met him before.
[173:01.78]Okay.
[173:03.04]But I can't find where she's from, who her family and friends are.
[173:05.92]Uh, nothing.
[173:09.27]However, I can tell she joined the association for her own reasons.
[173:15.03]But first, I want to take care of Yongji Mo and Professor Choi, these two.
[173:20.01]These two people come in to sell anything.
[173:21.72]Tell them you'll pay a lot.
[173:24.54]What I'm saying is offer them at least double the evaluation price.
[173:27.62]What?
[173:28.76]I want it done this week.
[173:35.27]And they may not be idiots, but likely to be adverse criminals.
[173:40.68]Okay, hold on.
[173:41.06]Let's go to the settings.
[173:45.92]No, I can't.
[173:47.54]It's just skipping dialogue for me.
[173:50.26]I don't like that.
[173:51.68]Like, let me do... Why do I even have the down arrow that indicates that you can hit A or something?
[173:58.61]Whatever.
[174:06.62]How much is the emotion tracker?
[174:09.92]Emotion tracker?
[174:12.48]Oh, whoa, wow!
[174:15.08]750 bucks, he just came right in.
[174:20.66]Hold on, Bob, there's a problem.
[174:22.30]Seems the woman who tried to sell us the Everbrown Ring is backbiting us.
[174:27.11]The citizen discourse data says she's telling people we called her ring garbage.
[174:31.51]Didn't she really get it was the shitty ring and its owner to be blamed?
[174:35.19]But there are always people like her.
[174:37.73]They're so malicious.
[174:39.49]Fortunately, I don't see any change in this card.
[174:42.63]Attractiveness of Darcy's, however.
[174:43.96]Okay, good.
[174:44.40]We had a good reputation to start with.
[174:46.52]Time has come to learn about the last reputation card, Attractiveness of Darcy's.
[174:52.34]This card tells customers' moods when they're leaving our store.
[174:55.04]Okay.
[174:57.32]card's effects will become increasingly disadvantaged to you if you behave recklessly or hurt customers feelings by ignoring their demands it only works during haggling and disappears right after your purchase causing a change to the appraised value okay fyi or attractiveness doesn't go up and down in a flash so please don't be too obsessed with it trying to be nice to every customer the plant is dying I I can't water the plant
[175:27.18]Normally the price effect of the card attracted will gradually fall below zero and keep falling so I don't want to be Still let us buy things at lower prices.
[175:35.19]You don't have to think so hard though Keep in mind that you reaching level five means your attractiveness raging is its peak by the way.
[175:41.21]She's so annoying Okay, kind of like you Talking every day.
[175:45.94]I need somebody to fill up the showcase.
[175:47.46]Okay, good How do I do this?
[175:53.85]Since I'm not an expert, I don't know its details, but you're an expert.
[175:56.17]You can find something, right?
[175:57.11]Okay.
[176:00.40]Attractiveness of Darcy's.
[176:01.66]267.
[176:05.46]Alright, let's take a look.
[176:09.96]It's not damaged.
[176:11.46]It's fine.
[176:13.92]What's it made out of?
[176:14.77]Wood?
[176:18.09]Wooden?
[176:18.61]Yeah.
[176:18.71]2067.
[176:18.73]It said 2067.
[176:20.17]What do you got?
[176:24.10]Uh, nothing significant on it, but it's probably signed.
[176:25.93]Let's take a look.
[176:27.45]Alright, he's got no signature found.
[176:28.85]Alright, so how is this authentic?
[176:31.81]How do I know that they painted this?
[176:38.84]I can't, I don't know.
[176:42.62]This is just wood, this is not a brand.
[176:43.62]Yeah, this is just wood.
[176:48.52]I don't know who painted that.
[176:49.39]I can't be- I can't validate this.
[176:50.69]I'll give you a hundred fuck- a hundred fucking bucks for it.
[176:55.09]I'll give you a hundred fifty.
[176:56.01]This is a taxidermy?
[177:05.90]How do you taxidermy a bug?
[177:10.26]What are you- what are you talking about?
[177:12.78]Oh, no, no, no.
[177:13.36]I was giving it a second thought.
[177:14.66]If I could trust your recommendation.
[177:18.47]The truth is, I'm in Graphological Study Club, and the club holds meetings every Monday.
[177:25.34]So I thought I could rely on you to get something with an autograph for today's meeting.
[177:31.70]But it occurred to me that your recommendation may not be satisfying.
[177:34.78]If your recommendation turns out to be reliable, I'll come back.
[177:38.66]Um, okay.
[177:41.38]So I would love to turn over and talk to you guys, but the game just skips all the dialogue.
[177:45.04]There's a full letter grade reduced for me.
[177:48.26]That's literally a full letter grade.
[177:49.48]It's a full letter grade.
[177:51.72]Bob, you've heard the news that AVAC found the FixRain tech file.
[177:54.57]See?
[177:54.81]Like, it's a full letter grade.
[177:56.99]And the AV... Okay.
[177:58.19]Like, you're not allowed to look at the screen.
[178:03.00]This is the time for our union to step up.
[178:04.60]We've got to hold a protest against FixRain.
[178:07.67]I know AVAC has never told us they would stop the fix rate.
[178:10.49]If you're gonna have, like, 500 pages of dialogue in a game, let me, like, let me read it and decide when I'm ready to go.
[178:17.03]Like, you can't just, it's like a fucking cutscene I have to pay attention to.
[178:19.37]Hold shift.
[178:25.76]I didn't do anything.
[178:27.00]I've already asked all the merchant members.
[178:28.30]I'm holding shift right now.
[178:29.96]No, didn't do anything.
[178:35.73]It's not a streamer game?
[178:37.86]Even if I was just sitting here playing this, like, I can't even look- What am I gonna look for?
[178:40.44]What if somebody texts me?
[178:41.76]And I look down for five seconds.
[178:42.82]What do you say, Bob?
[178:45.86]Are you gonna be with us?
[178:46.76]I don't- I don't- Alright.
[178:48.54]He's talking about the union meeting.
[178:53.97]Pause the game?
[178:56.01]I- How do you- How are you- I can't pause the game.
[178:58.99]Uh, do I do the union meeting?
[179:16.93]Should I do it?
[179:20.19]Aren't they gonna, like, come after me?
[179:33.09]I can't water- I don't have any water!
[179:35.11]I don't have any water!
[179:38.51]Okay, I... I'll do it.
[179:44.65]You don't need to bring anything.
[179:45.67]I'll tell you what to do.
[179:46.49]Do I have to do it every day?
[179:47.93]What if I forget?
[180:08.80]Two pieces of breaking news.
[180:09.88]The first piece of news.
[180:11.38]After being arrested for excessive perfume usage, a woman countersued an AVAC member who arrested her.
[180:17.67]The woman said he was holding a huge piece of bread when he arrested me.
[180:22.35]Claiming eating that huge bread alone is also avarice.
[180:27.49]On this matter, Professor Yongjo Choi, who is on a solo protest, said, My concerns have become reality.
[180:34.14]Saying, this is why I'm crying for clear guidelines.
[180:36.34]Okay.
[180:38.32]So he's also making another claim of his own.
[180:40.44]That ABC is developing a new technology to replace artificial rainfall.
[180:44.63]New technology, my ass.
[180:47.31]ABC, however, declined to comment on this claim.
[180:50.11]Next up.
[180:51.19]More than 200 citizens are complaining of severe cold symptoms.
[180:53.93]So what?
[180:54.65]They're already doing it to us.
[180:57.52]Yeah, they're already doing it to us.
[181:00.36]This rain is not natural rain.
[181:01.96]They're already trying something else.
[181:05.34]I felt sorry, but the rule of no umbrellas allowed will remain.
[181:07.84]Okay.
[181:10.94]This is the reporter for the news.
[181:12.80]Alright.
[181:15.53]Yeah, they're putting something in the water.
[181:17.43]Whatever.
[181:17.79]Hi.
[181:20.23]I like to sell this.
[181:22.55]It's been a hundred years already.
[181:27.08]We need 8 more years to make it 100 years.
[181:28.84]Alright, let's go back to playing the video game.
[181:32.50]You look very generous.
[181:34.50]Well, thanks.
[181:36.60]It is fairly damaged, you already got that right.
[181:39.89]Uh, hold on, it does not deserve anything until I figure out what it is.
[181:43.97]Paper, you got that right.
[181:46.21]1988, it has archaeological value, and did somebody sign it?
[181:50.64]No.
[181:51.54]I mean, it does have archaeological value, I'll give you that.
[181:58.16]Uh, yeah, price is gonna go up.
[182:00.22]Thank you.
[182:02.04]I'll give you, uh, I'll give you 60 bucks for it.
[182:10.47]Good.
[182:18.03]Who's this?
[182:19.43]Oops, are you the new owner here?
[182:20.71]I don't think we met before.
[182:21.65]This is Darcy's second oldest son, Bob, and he is temporarily under my wing.
[182:29.08]Ah, then you must be the one who came back from Bluebird.
[182:32.73]Is it that you came back for Fixer, isn't it?
[182:35.09]Well, then I have a lot to say on that.
[182:38.53]Since I'm here for another important thing, can you spare some minutes for me?
[182:43.17]I heard a rumor that someone in the Citizens Alliance Institute had found an antidote for Fixer.
[182:47.24]This is too many names.
[182:49.26]I can't remember all these fucking names.
[182:52.22]But Fixer's not a poison.
[182:53.28]What was the antidote?
[182:53.88]There's like the Institute of Crimes Against Institutes.
[182:57.84]Like, it's too many names.
[183:00.13]Defend against Fixer to protect Floaties.
[183:02.57]It was an antidote.
[183:03.17]It was a cure.
[183:04.75]So even though I know there's like two, there might be nothing left.
[183:09.36]I will go to the Institute this weekend to look for any clues about the antidote.
[183:12.78]There's like two names.
[183:18.50]I want to ask you to get me two things so that I can get to the Institute.
[183:22.98]One thing is an AVAC ID card.
[183:26.34]Some people are stealing the ID cards to mess with AVAC, and surely some of them will come here to sell the cards.
[183:31.94]The other thing is Time Cinema, which I invented myself.
[183:35.91]By setting a certain time and shining it on a particular site, you can watch a hologram of what happened to the time and place- Okay.
[183:47.12]Someone stole it last week.
[183:48.42]I tracked it down and found it somewhere near this shop.
[183:51.86]I'm sure the thief is picking the right time to sell my Time Cinema to you.
[183:56.58]So please help me to get an AVAC card and my Time Cinema back by this Friday.
[184:01.55]With your help, I'll be able to get to the Institute and we can change the world together.
[184:04.21]Remember, your brain's running on a dual-core processor.
[184:11.12]I've been reading you a book for three hours.
[184:17.25]Is this authentic easy enough?
[184:21.39]You can see the slogan, can't you?
[184:23.92]You can't tell just by the slogan?
[184:27.08]Easy enough changed their slogan before.
[184:28.96]Let's take a look.
[184:31.44]Alright.
[184:32.08]First of all, this thing sucks.
[184:35.62]Core 2 Duo.
[184:39.52]Brand easy enough.
[184:40.44]Let's see if that's accurate.
[184:43.86]Alright.
[184:44.08]Is this even on here?
[184:45.82]This is this.
[184:47.56]Is this canvas?
[184:50.96]Yeah, this is canvas.
[184:54.74]Made out of canvas.
[185:00.32]Let's find out.
[185:01.62]First of all, what year is this?
[185:02.80]2068?
[185:02.82]Why is that weird?
[185:05.12]Oh, that's weird.
[185:08.16]It's nothing significant on the year.
[185:11.77]No signatures, but let's take a look at the brand list.
[185:15.58]And this was, uh, easy... What is it?
[185:19.84]Easy bake?
[185:20.76]Easy, easy enough.
[185:21.54]Alright.
[185:23.40]Uh, alright.
[185:23.90]A bag brand rumored to be supplied to the military.
[185:27.63]Easy enough.
[185:28.13]Some of its products have soldiers' names, and those who believe in the rumor collect them.
[185:32.19]It also sells goods other than bags.
[185:36.13]Uh, this is, no, this, they don't sell canvas bags.
[185:38.13]This is fake.
[185:45.56]Sorry.
[185:45.86]I mean, I hate to be the bearer of bad news here, but this shit ain't real.
[185:58.79]Uh, this is wrong material.
[186:03.69]Sorry.
[186:09.53]That did seem cheap.
[186:11.55]Mm-hmm.
[186:13.70]So, I mean, if you got a fake bag here... There's a missing slogan, too.
[186:28.65]Usually there's a slogan on it.
[186:29.77]They didn't... Yeah, what are you talking about?
[186:31.25]You weren't making any sense.
[186:32.23]What?
[186:32.49]It says they have a slogan.
[186:33.92]Shit, it does have a slogan on it.
[186:35.14]It's right on there.
[186:35.90]Fuck.
[186:37.60]Does it need a verifying autograph?
[186:42.13]Some of its products have names.
[186:44.73]Okay.
[186:47.96]No, okay.
[186:50.42]That's fine.
[186:53.18]You already confirmed it's fake.
[186:58.05]I mean, what does brand eraser do?
[187:03.48]Wrong slogan?
[187:04.02]Yeah, that's what I just tried.
[187:04.88]And they said it was... It doesn't say all of them.
[187:07.61]It says some of them.
[187:09.05]And that is the right slogan.
[187:10.05]Wait, let's get easy.
[187:11.45]Easy enough?
[187:15.51]Easy enough for everyone.
[187:17.27]What?
[187:17.51]How is that not wrong?
[187:20.25]Until 64.
[187:20.85]Oh.
[187:21.41]Oh, okay.
[187:22.39]2068.
[187:23.49]I see.
[187:23.83]Okay.
[187:30.19]Alright, well, I'll give you, um... I mean, this thing's junk.
[187:34.19]It's not real.
[187:34.71]I'll give you fucking five dollars for it.
[187:36.89]Should I erase the brand?
[187:39.35]I like to erase the info about the brand.
[187:45.18]If we're doing that again, you've already told me there's something wrong with the material.
[187:50.52]And I've already agreed it's not authentic.
[187:51.96]Easy enough.
[187:54.04]Yeah, so I'm... I don't want to keep the fucking label on it.
[188:19.08]It's not a real bag!
[188:20.18]25.
[188:20.20]And get out of here.
[188:27.88]Oh my fucking god.
[188:28.88]Get out of my store and leave.
[188:41.23]Hi.
[188:42.25]Sniff.
[188:42.53]Sorry, I have a cold after the rain last week.
[188:46.96]Could you buy this off of me?
[188:47.90]Oh, it's an umbrella.
[188:51.31]Okay.
[188:52.49]Um... Yes, $50.
[188:54.49]Sell it for... It sells for... I have to... Oh, it sells for $50.
[189:10.90]I thought I had to buy them all for $50.
[189:12.10]Didn't they say, these are $50.
[189:15.30]Don't sell them for more.
[189:16.40]Don't buy them for more.
[189:20.34]Anything less than 50 would be profit.
[189:22.00]I can't sell those.
[189:24.15]I can't sell those umbrellas.
[189:28.67]He's buying them from you for 50.
[189:30.53]Well, look, it's kind of hard to pay attention.
[189:32.35]There's like eight different storylines and like five different fucking organizations and like a bar of papers, please, down here.
[189:39.74]I had to have like 20-minute dialogue conversations with half of these people.
[189:44.58]That may have been like 25 years ago, how long that happened to go.
[189:49.38]Okay.
[189:57.67]I mean, seriously.
[189:58.49]Alright, you got a brand on here.
[190:02.39]Let me get this right.
[190:06.39]It's more than slightly damaged, I think.
[190:11.00]But we're going to just say it's slightly damaged.
[190:12.68]Okay.
[190:17.86]Uh-huh.
[190:18.04]Alright, so then... What's it made out of?
[190:20.40]That material is... I don't think that's a special brand.
[190:22.34]Maybe it is.
[190:22.72]I don't see that on here.
[190:28.91]Find Feel 2072.
[190:29.85]Okay, does it have a signature?
[190:34.48]No.
[190:35.18]What about brand?
[190:37.38]I think this is actually legit.
[190:39.00]Let's see.
[190:41.24]So this is the FXXXX.
[190:45.72]Oh shit, it's real.
[190:47.78]Okay, yeah.
[190:51.05]You got it?
[190:51.37]Yeah, you're right.
[190:52.69]It's their eco-friendly bag.
[191:00.58]So this is, wait, let's make sure.
[191:01.66]Find feel.
[191:02.80]Brand that makes sundry goods and claims to advocate eco-friendliness.
[191:07.24]The royals love its eco-friendly fabric products.
[191:10.44]All its employees got fixed in 2079.
[191:12.10]Yep, that makes sense.
[191:15.86]Okay.
[191:17.86]Okay, so cool.
[191:18.74]It's, um... Yeah.
[191:25.26]The royals love this.
[191:28.80]Popular among the royals.
[191:31.91]Royals may like this.
[191:33.41]Oh shit.
[191:36.95]Well, alright.
[191:39.19]I think that's good.
[191:40.61]Alright, I got enough for you.
[191:43.65]I'll give you a fucking 200 bucks for it.
[191:52.28]Nice.
[191:54.30]That's not the wrong material.
[191:59.42]Nothing's for sale.
[192:00.30]What the fuck?
[192:01.26]Nothing's in my store.
[192:02.16]Alright, I'm selling this for $3.50.
[192:11.48]Sell this painting.
[192:13.32]Look, I'm not even making any fucking money.
[192:14.65]What am I doing?
[192:15.25]$300.
[192:15.27]$100. $100.
[192:26.17]Tell the cheese for 40.
[192:28.05]Oh, what else do I have here?
[192:34.76]What's this postcard?
[192:36.00]Oh, it's a stamp.
[192:36.64]Okay.
[192:36.84]Yeah.
[192:37.06]Oh shit.
[192:37.30]That's worth a lot.
[192:37.78]75.
[192:39.16]And I'm going to put this one in the window.
[192:44.41]I think that's good.
[192:49.69]Probably right.
[192:50.37]Yeah.
[192:53.68]That's good.
[192:57.18]Alright, good.
[193:00.56]You did a great job with the fake ID.
[193:02.12]Since you might accidentally sell it or lose it if you keep it here.
[193:06.66]Let me keep it safe for you.
[193:07.82]Oh.
[193:09.28]I was actually about to put that up too.
[193:12.77]Another task.
[193:13.81]This time you have to get ready for merchant registration.
[193:16.49]Without it, you running the store for more than two weeks is illegal.
[193:20.29]Nothing's complicated.
[193:21.07]Just go to the Stabilizer's office and pay the registration fee.
[193:24.91]The stabilizer is not there in the evening, so make sure to visit him in the morning.
[193:28.71]Registration fee will be $1,300.
[193:29.83]Okay.
[193:32.73]Finish this before tomorrow morning.
[193:34.37]If you fail to register, you can no longer run this place.
[193:36.80]Take a look at the calendar and never forget to make it.
[193:38.46]I can... I can afford it.
[193:51.53]I can afford it.
[193:56.60]Alright, let me take a break.
[193:57.31]I'm gonna go pee.
[193:58.77]I'm gonna refill some water.
[193:59.67]I'll be right back.
[194:04.40]I will BRB.
[198:58.91]I am back.
[198:59.59]Hello.
[199:02.11]Crispy, juicy, chicken tender sandwich.
[199:06.40]Oh, why'd you do that?
[199:07.10]Alright, so what are my tasks?
[199:14.82]I have some tasks.
[199:18.16]I gotta pay $1,300 to the, uh, not the, wait, isn't the union thing today too?
[199:25.39]Yeah, I have like a union meeting.
[199:34.80]Alright, yeah, it was on the first floor of my apartment building, right?
[199:38.45]I gotta go to the stabilizer, right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[199:40.39]Alright, whoa, this is, oh, shit.
[199:51.56]Can't resume, wait, this is the, oh, I have to go over there.
[199:56.72]I'm here.
[199:59.42]Participate, okay.
[200:01.32]Hey Bob, come join us!
[200:02.74]Come on, shout with us!
[200:04.30]Stop the fixed rain project.
[200:08.10]Uh... Oh shit, what do I do?
[200:11.06]Should I say it?
[200:12.96]There's probably a person watching me here.
[200:16.15]What if I, um... Stop the proj- stop the project!
[200:25.63]Good job.
[200:26.77]Alright.
[200:27.19]Stop the project.
[200:27.99]Alright.
[200:29.45]I gotta go.
[200:31.01]Oh.
[200:38.12]Alright.
[200:38.74]Let me decompress here.
[200:42.86]Alright.
[200:43.98]So they added taxes.
[200:48.48]Mary from the AVAC is targeting these people.
[200:52.30]These two people.
[200:55.69]A member of the graphological study club.
[200:58.57]And I need to have a recommendation for them.
[201:03.07]Okay, get in the protest.
[201:10.19]Help.
[201:10.83]Okay, Professor Choi asked me for help to get him an ID card and his time cinema.
[201:18.66]I need to go to the stabilizer and give $1,300.
[201:20.28]Alright.
[201:26.74]Was that- that was a game-changing plot decision?
[201:28.70]It probably was.
[201:29.50]I think I have to do that every day.
[201:37.24]Alright.
[201:43.47]First things first, I gotta go... Uh... Hey Loafer!
[201:48.37]Did you not see me?
[201:49.09]Why don't you ever say hi to me?
[201:50.35]You've seen my face enough, don't say you're too busy to remember.
[201:56.45]Whatever.
[201:59.87]Look who it is.
[202:01.45]Look who it is.
[202:10.84]Alright, I gotta go to the stabilizer.
[202:11.96]I have enough money.
[202:14.70]Ride bus to the... Oh, I can do that?
[202:17.10]Whoa.
[202:22.03]Okay, that's cool.
[202:23.29]Alright, let's pay it.
[202:25.48]Look who's here.
[202:26.26]What is it about?
[202:28.28]I want to apply for a merchant registration, please.
[202:31.64]Can you afford it?
[202:33.52]I do have the money.
[202:35.94]Thank you.
[202:38.39]Alright, I'm registered.
[202:42.49]I only have $140, though.
[202:44.21]He's out here today again.
[202:48.11]Stop.
[202:48.47]Okay.
[202:48.73]Should I get a lower tax rating?
[202:52.84]No.
[202:53.02]No.
[202:55.78]That was so much, it was a lot.
[203:00.02]Like always, thanks for not running away.
[203:01.40]Yep.
[203:01.78]Alright, good morning!
[203:05.11]Have a restrained and greed-free day, thank you.
[203:09.33]I have stuff for sale.
[203:10.41]Oh wait, it's this guy again.
[203:13.01]Did you remove your bandages?
[203:15.76]You really don't look like your father.
[203:18.30]Now I get why there's a rumor that says you're not Darcy's biological son.
[203:23.87]Hey, don't be serious.
[203:25.05]I'm just kidding.
[203:25.67]This is why I'm here anyway.
[203:27.91]I'll give you this at $100.
[203:29.25]You sell it by yourself.
[203:32.94]Hey, it's already expired.
[203:34.00]We can't buy this at $100.
[203:37.14]I'm taking the money.
[203:39.72]What?
[203:41.46]And lately, I'm offering special loans for pitiful kids.
[203:44.00]Write you.
[203:45.87]And you can lend $1,500 by paying only $450 per three days as interest.
[203:50.65]So don't miss it.
[203:51.27]I'm not doing that.
[203:53.77]Of what?
[203:54.29]What did he say?
[203:55.81]I don't want a lawn.
[203:59.27]Someone's going to come in and I'm going to sell that shit.
[204:02.36]Don't worry.
[204:03.76]Picket on the showcase.
[204:04.84]How much is it?
[204:07.16]That's 100 bucks.
[204:09.56]Alright, good.
[204:11.18]We're back in the green.
[204:12.04]What the hell was that?
[204:18.57]Okay?
[204:19.59]Just like what I expected, this place always looks like Junuk of Sing Sing, you know?
[204:24.70]What do you got here?
[204:25.28]This is a backpack.
[204:28.18]Let's get easy, easy enough.
[204:30.34]So you think it's easy?
[204:31.14]Alright, let's make sure.
[204:31.86]Let's take a look at it.
[204:32.44]Hold on.
[204:33.46]This is in perfect fucking condition.
[204:38.03]So not only that, this looks to be authentic by easy enough.
[204:49.26]Check that again.
[204:49.80]This is authentic.
[204:53.93]This is military grade PVC.
[204:59.79]Pretty good.
[205:01.75]Uh, what else?
[205:02.71]Let's get easy, easy enough.
[205:04.03]When was this made?
[205:04.61]2080 until 64.
[205:06.38]Uh, alright.
[205:07.16]Is there anybody's name?
[205:09.66]No signature.
[205:15.72]Oh, fuck.
[205:16.66]I can't buy this.
[205:17.38]Shit.
[205:20.00]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[205:21.70]Oh, that's not good.
[205:24.69]Let's get easy, easy enough.
[205:26.37]No, that's fine.
[205:27.01]This is legit.
[205:27.69]This is legit.
[205:30.37]I can't afford it, though, so I'm going to have to offer a stupid low ball.
[205:33.09]140. 140.
[205:50.98]She actually did it.
[205:56.90]I have $3 left.
[205:58.08]Alright, get this out.
[205:58.96]Get this out on the table immediately.
[206:06.19]$400.
[206:06.53]Let's go.
[206:09.87]Since I'm not an expert, I don't know its details, but you're an expert.
[206:12.33]Can you find something?
[206:14.29]Oh, it's a fucking umbrella.
[206:16.67]I have to buy this.
[206:20.39]GameStopAndy.
[206:21.83]Will you take $2?
[206:36.94]Can you explain what made you get to that price?
[206:46.90]Well...
[206:49.12]I'm telling you, this thing has got no fucking value.
[206:53.06]It's just, this is no value at all on here.
[206:55.92]It's too damaged to even evaluate this.
[207:02.29]Like, why can't I just lie?
[207:07.35]And it's made out of paper.
[207:16.27]I can't say it's like damaged.
[207:21.23]It's not even an umbrella.
[207:22.47]2074.
[207:26.33]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[207:29.74]She already said it's damaged.
[207:30.98]Yeah.
[207:32.54]I can't afford it.
[207:33.06]I can't buy it.
[207:34.58]Just leave.
[207:35.42]I can't buy this.
[207:38.80]I'm supposed to be buying these.
[207:40.13]I'm getting bad.
[207:40.67]Verification's going down.
[207:45.41]How much is the picked up stamp?
[207:46.77]75 bucks.
[207:50.88]Alright, I know you- okay, okay, okay.
[207:53.62]See?
[207:55.54]See?
[207:55.76]I had to prove it to you.
[208:02.98]Good afternoon, Bob.
[208:04.62]Can I ask you if you're ready with the items I asked for?
[208:09.31]Excuse my impatience.
[208:10.95]I know I told you it's by Friday.
[208:12.47]And nobody came in with anything.
[208:16.75]I've been feeling like I'm being chased by something these days because AVAC set me up as their number one target.
[208:21.19]You know, AVAC hates me for standing against Fixerain.
[208:26.50]My idea is that everyone has a right to decide whether to get fixed or not.
[208:30.14]When they first proposed their idea about Fixerain, their excuse was equality.
[208:34.00]They claimed people with physical impairments were not having equal access to Fixer.
[208:38.77]But listen, AVAC has never let people use umbrellas during Fixerain, and they poured down Fixer like crazy for a week.
[208:46.83]But I think that was the worst case of human rights trampling.
[208:52.72]Ugh, I got carried away.
[208:53.46]Sorry.
[208:54.98]There's the door right behind you if you're done.
[208:57.96]No, no, no.
[208:58.56]I came here to sell something, actually.
[209:01.00]It's so beautiful, right?
[209:02.18]Whenever I look at it, their tenacity.
[209:05.02]Please cut to the chase.
[209:07.50]Uh, I don't need a lot of money.
[209:08.72]Because AVAC might come after me again.
[209:12.69]So please just pay me a fair amount, Bob.
[209:16.35]What even is this thing?
[209:17.07]What's this man out of?
[209:21.39]Clay?
[209:24.75]Man out of clay.
[209:25.31]What year is this from?
[209:25.93]2080?
[209:25.97]What you got yourself here is a... What you got yourself here is a choice of weed from your front lawn.
[209:35.57]Uh, you signed it.
[209:36.55]Okay.
[209:37.01]You're not even on this list.
[209:47.18]That's a fake autograph.
[209:53.16]Criminal signature?
[210:02.25]Fine, fine.
[210:03.39]I'll give you 30 bucks.
[210:04.35]Now, get out of here.
[210:05.29]Go.
[210:05.35]Go.
[210:18.01]I can't pay double.
[210:19.11]I don't have enough to pay double.
[210:24.75]One of my friends gave this to me, so I don't know much about it, but I hope you will.
[210:29.19]I can't even... This is... Just leave.
[210:31.05]I don't know.
[210:31.65]Take it somewhere else.
[210:33.17]I can't... I have $48.
[210:33.87]I don't want a loan.
[210:34.71]Fuck.
[210:40.72]Okay, fine.
[210:50.17]It's in not perfect condition.
[210:52.07]That's slightly damaged.
[210:52.87]Okay.
[210:59.60]This is... I think this is accurate.
[211:04.14]This is the FFFXXXX brand.
[211:10.18]Yep.
[211:10.58]It's this one here.
[211:11.22]This is the Eco Fabric.
[211:18.43]And what year?
[211:19.09]2076. 2076.
[211:21.58]Okay.
[211:23.14]Royers love the eco-friendly product.
[211:25.38]Okay.
[211:33.53]And is it not signed by anybody?
[211:35.11]It's not.
[211:35.99]But it's legit.
[211:42.22]What the fuck?
[211:42.70]What?
[211:44.68]What?
[211:46.46]I'll give you $150 for it.
[211:51.11]Alone?
[211:52.09]What about it?
[211:52.53]205, you can still leave a margin with it.
[211:59.18]195, take it or leave it.
[212:09.33]Alright, get out.
[212:12.89]This is all gonna sell for a shitload of money.
[212:14.45]Look at all the products I have.
[212:17.53]I'd like to buy the taxidermied butterfly over there.
[212:19.54]How much is it?
[212:21.02]That'll be $300.
[212:21.42]Got it.
[212:22.00]Should I not sell this?
[212:40.49]This is like his product.
[212:41.47]Should I not sell it?
[212:44.13]Okay, what else we got?
[212:45.07]Is that it?
[212:55.13]Okay.
[212:57.05]Crabgrass.
[213:01.63]Alright, I need to pay this loan back.
[213:04.66]It's just something I found.
[213:05.64]You want it?
[213:06.96]Just take it.
[213:07.50]Maybe he's going to pester me for it.
[213:09.72]Okay, I got an ID card.
[213:10.56]Come on, take it.
[213:15.66]What was the quest?
[213:19.58]What was the quest?
[213:21.82]What are my quests?
[213:24.15]I'll take it.
[213:32.07]Are they going to get mad if I have this?
[213:34.79]Ooh, lucky.
[213:39.16]Powder from Midaleso on the showcase.
[213:41.34]How much is it?
[213:41.84]40 bucks for the cheese powder.
[213:45.30]I don't see the reason to buy it for that price.
[213:47.18]I'll buy it right away if it's 32.
[213:49.56]Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for 4,000 of you to be proven wrong.
[213:54.50]35. 35.
[214:02.15]I'll offer you... 10.
[214:05.17]No.
[214:06.63]30.
[214:07.65]No.
[214:08.54]I can't counteroffer.
[214:11.72]Sorry!
[214:14.88]Just take it.
[214:15.32]I don't fucking want this thing anymore.
[214:26.99]Click harder.
[214:31.66]It's good to see you keeping the store as it used to be.
[214:33.51]It's still so rugged.
[214:34.43]What's that supposed to mean?
[214:38.55]Uh, is it bookmark?
[214:40.23]Read, people, read.
[214:41.19]Okay, it's made out of platinum, though.
[214:42.73]Hold on.
[214:44.31]This is in really good condition.
[214:49.32]And I think this is not platinum.
[214:51.76]This is made out of gold, bro.
[214:53.08]Bro, this is made out of gold.
[215:10.30]And 2077.
[215:11.22]Oh man, this has got significance.
[215:18.05]Fixer 1.0.
[215:19.15]Is it signed too?
[215:20.57]No.
[215:21.93]Fixer 1.0.
[215:25.65]This is from the year... This is worth a thousand fucking dollars.
[215:30.85]Huh?
[215:31.11]What?
[215:31.41]What?
[215:33.63]This ring was made in 2077!
[215:36.73]That's significant.
[215:41.53]It's not related?
[215:42.28]Yeah, it's the same year.
[215:46.72]It has no connection.
[215:47.64]The connection is the year.
[215:48.86]It was in the same year.
[215:49.92]That's significant.
[215:51.40]Yes, it is.
[215:51.80]That's related.
[215:57.75]So wait, hold on a minute.
[215:58.81]So you're telling me, wait a minute.
[216:00.49]So you're telling me that the date doesn't matter just because it's... Okay, hold on a minute.
[216:04.01]Let's be clear about this.
[216:06.49]So my birthday is Hobbit Day.
[216:09.15]Is that... But that's not connected at all.
[216:11.49]I was born on that day.
[216:13.09]I'm not connected to the world of Lord of the Rings.
[216:15.11]So there's no relation there then.
[216:17.62]So there's absolutely no relation at all.
[216:20.56]Cool.
[216:21.22]Just make sure we clear that up.
[216:27.54]Okay.
[216:28.06]So let's just make sure we clear that up.
[216:29.60]How much do I give you 200?
[216:30.90]I'll give you 300 bucks for it.
[216:39.31]350.
[216:45.67]Say yes.
[216:46.21]Alright.
[216:46.91]400 final offer or leave.
[216:52.17]What?
[216:59.15]I didn't even give him a chance to respond.
[217:06.43]It's me, Wonsu.
[217:07.69]I don't know.
[217:09.29]How have you been in Bluebird?
[217:11.77]Why did you run away without any words?
[217:13.41]He just sat there.
[217:16.69]Why are you trying to avoid Fixer?
[217:18.89]You must realize Fixer is a salvation for all of us, Bob.
[217:21.61]If someone tries to stop Fixering, I will do whatever to stop them, even if it's you.
[217:25.47]Fixer's the only salvation left for me.
[217:26.99]You understand that, right?
[217:29.37]Anyway, it's good to have you back, Bob.
[217:30.71]I'll drop by again.
[217:31.37]Alright, good to see you.
[217:32.01]I don't even remember who the fuck you are.
[217:36.77]Imagine you go to haggle somebody and they're like, alright, I'll give you 300.
[217:39.31]Alright, I'll give you 400.
[217:41.91]He's like, oh, just be quiet.
[217:44.39]He'll fucking argue with himself.
[217:49.75]Ooh, nice.
[217:50.93]Sell the bag.
[217:56.97]Alright, the day's over.
[217:57.79]How much is my, um, loan for?
[217:59.18]Pay the loan off immediately.
[218:08.40]$1,900?
[218:08.70]What the fuck just happened?
[218:13.72]$450 every three days?
[218:15.22]It hasn't even been three days.
[218:18.28]It's been one day.
[218:21.96]Is that, like, $100 and something a day?
[218:25.64]You borrowed $1,500.
[218:28.38]Yeah, but it hasn't been three days.
[218:32.88]It started with the interest on top.
[218:34.66]That doesn't make any sense.
[218:40.61]Interest has to accrue over time.
[218:42.35]You don't just start with it on top.
[218:45.03]450 per day for three days?
[218:47.95]Every three days it increases.
[218:51.39]You gotta be shitting me.
[218:55.19]You hire me as a temp.
[218:57.37]I can erase every unhelpful signature on your items.
[219:00.75]Give me 15.
[219:01.95]Isn't it good?
[219:02.51]I'm trying to process even what the fuck you just said.
[219:09.01]So I can give him $15 a day and he can erase signatures.
[219:17.19]I mean, that doesn't seem like very much money.
[219:18.49]Sure.
[219:21.77]Sure.
[219:32.26]Alright, participate.
[219:33.38]Hey, Bob, come join us.
[219:35.06]Come on, shout with us.
[219:36.36]Stop the fixer project.
[219:37.53]Okay, stop the project.
[219:43.07]Good job.
[219:43.51]15 for each item.
[219:45.87]That's not bad, though.
[219:46.57]I can probably get more money.
[219:51.23]Okay.
[219:55.58]Stabilizer sold me an expired certificate and mentioned that he offers loans.
[220:01.02]Get a loan to pay the loan off.
[220:02.20]Get more loans?
[220:03.20]I don't want more loans.
[220:04.94]I wanna pay back the loan that I have now.
[220:32.18]I'll be picking up umbrellas tomorrow.
[220:33.54]See you at the store.
[220:35.33]See you later.
[220:46.37]Please end the stream.
[220:47.18]It's 4 a.m.
[220:50.06]It's like 6 o'clock.
[220:51.18]Whatever.
[221:02.15]As you can see, I'm rusty now.
[221:07.34]It's you again.
[221:07.90]If you're not trying to double pay the registration fee, stop bothering me.
[221:11.40]I just want to see what's going on.
[221:21.11]I need more items.
[221:22.25]I need to make a lot of money.
[221:23.83]Okay, what about this other stuff down here?
[221:30.39]Is this stuff open yet?
[221:34.20]No, all these places are closed.
[221:42.72]Play Thrillville off the rails?
[221:47.07]I mean, no, maybe.
[221:49.11]Keep this lovely doll until the end.
[221:50.57]Gonna drop it?
[221:54.73]He's gonna come in and he's gonna sell the doll.
[221:58.57]Wait, can I buy water from this person to water my plant?
[222:06.56]Alright, I bought that plant.
[222:07.58]Alright, here we go.
[222:12.72]Have a restrained and greed-free day.
[222:14.02]Okay, let's go.
[222:16.70]After the flood, everyone was looking for Mona Lisa like crazy.
[222:20.15]But they ended up with nothing.
[222:21.87]Because it was in my hands.
[222:23.05]Well, you have the Mona Lisa.
[222:25.83]The Mona Lisa.
[222:28.47]You wouldn't dare say you don't know who painted this.
[222:31.33]And a painting like this deserves to be called at least great pieced.
[222:36.45]You can't call it Great Peace by yourself.
[222:40.41]Great Peace refers to a painting created by a famous artist.
[222:44.49]You're saying some nobody drew this painting?
[222:46.22]That's a terrible joke.
[222:48.92]Okay, we have policies.
[222:49.88]Let's take a look.
[222:54.14]Okay.
[222:54.76]First, check if there's a signature on the artwork.
[222:58.48]Uh, when the signature is on the signatures list.
[223:02.75]When the signature is is not on the list or no signature is found.
[223:05.93]Okay.
[223:07.95]We're looking for signatures again.
[223:09.05]Pull out the art cards.
[223:11.35]So famous signatures.
[223:13.65]Okay.
[223:14.77]You can see the signatures of the famous.
[223:18.81]Use the signature detector on the painting.
[223:20.52]Yeah.
[223:22.30]No signature.
[223:24.58]It wasn't a signature on this painting, right?
[223:27.14]That means you cannot use the celebrity signature list nor admit it as a famous artist.
[223:32.70]Let's skip to the artwork page.
[223:36.66]As this painting doesn't have any autographs, you should choose from either failed, poor, or fine piece.
[223:41.14]Failed piece refers to pieces that seem to be drawn by foot.
[223:48.52]Fine piece refers to carefully drawn paintings.
[223:52.46]Poor piece is somewhere between those two.
[223:54.63]How would I be able to tell?
[223:55.41]Gosh, go on, Bob.
[223:59.59]Choose one.
[224:01.17]I mean...
[224:03.97]Is it technically a good, fine piece?
[224:07.39]Okay, but you didn't paint it with your foot.
[224:13.57]That's clear, right?
[224:21.67]Uh... Failed?
[224:25.16]No, it's like a fine piece.
[224:26.62]There's nothing wrong with it.
[224:28.60]Looks good.
[224:29.08]It's a fine piece.
[224:30.70]No, it's a fine piece.
[224:36.70]but uh artists on the list great piece when it was created into artist prime when it's already dead but none of these make any more sense you're not on the list so I don't do anything else there's no artist so what do I have a option to pick there's like nothing no nobody there
[225:06.65]1503.
[225:06.69]I mean, that's a- that's pretty fucking old.
[225:11.55]1503?
[225:16.45]It's kind of archaeologically valuable.
[225:31.74]Is this the actual Mona Lisa?
[225:38.41]It's slightly damaged.
[225:43.00]Did anybody paint real fake shit?
[225:44.88]Check the quality.
[225:47.08]It's slightly damaged.
[225:50.16]There's no signature, though.
[225:52.76]Is it the actual Mona Lisa?
[225:53.98]Okay, I'll offer you 500 bucks for it.
[226:14.74]Okay, I'm selling this for a thousand.
[226:20.00]Some art collectors may visit the store.
[226:21.50]They don't care about paying extra.
[226:23.32]So it's not a bad idea to not sell the artworks and wait for them to make a huge profit.
[226:26.96]Oh, shit.
[226:29.21]Deceased artist?
[226:33.53]The world's best crabgrass on the showcase.
[226:36.05]How much is it?
[226:36.59]In my opinion, 42 is right.
[226:49.47]Mona Lisa has no signature.
[226:52.28]It doesn't?
[226:55.50]I've never seen the Mona Lisa.
[227:00.54]It's fine.
[227:01.10]I'll take that.
[227:01.56]I don't care.
[227:05.46]It doesn't.
[227:05.88]I don't... Here's one.
[227:14.13]This is a freshly lifted ID card.
[227:15.55]How much can you offer me?
[227:17.39]No, I already have one.
[227:20.68]Nothing.
[227:20.90]I already have one.
[227:26.94]A VC ID card.
[227:28.26]I already have one.
[227:28.96]Get out of here.
[227:38.73]Mona Lisa is only famous because it was stolen a few times.
[227:41.17]It's trash.
[227:49.27]Oh my god, I gotta restock the store.
[227:51.83]It's trash.
[227:57.51]That's fucking funny.
[227:58.83]Holy shit, I can make $700 and $800 for this.
[228:02.13]Backpack just unwrapped, $400.
[228:10.79]I'm not gonna sell anything else, okay.
[228:18.59]I don't want this, I already have one.
[228:29.34]That was a cringe Reddit take.
[228:34.46]That backpack is worth $400.
[228:38.44]I paid more than I expected, but I won't complain.
[228:47.50]The official said they might start the fixed rain as early as this weekend.
[228:58.85]That's too early, this weekend, what?
[229:01.24]First ever person accused of adverse crime, Han Huang, started a new life by becoming an artist.
[229:07.12]I'd like a new start too.
[229:08.06]Huang stated, someone claimed that I exploited chippies, but chippies were my friends.
[229:15.80]Adding chippies will be the main theme of my work.
[229:19.26]And I guess Huang's occupation has now changed.
[229:22.38]Last up.
[229:23.42]The recycling committee has announced that this week's target material is plastic.
[229:27.56]Citizens who actively participate in plastic collection will be given hues made of recycled material.
[229:33.73]Don't be excited, Bob.
[229:34.45]It's only for citizens.
[229:35.25]It's for shopkeepers.
[229:37.55]Okay.
[229:40.99]Anyway, plastic items will get more attention this week.
[229:42.57]It's time to raise the material's price.
[229:43.99]Ooh.
[229:46.10]Ooh.
[229:48.42]Ooh.
[229:48.88]Oh, and if we already have plastics in our inventory, the price can also... Ooh.
[229:51.26]Ooh.
[229:52.59]Do I have plastic shit in my inventory?
[229:54.99]The bookmark on the showcase, how much is it?
[229:57.09]Is it made out of plastic?
[230:01.43]Doesn't seem to be worth that much.
[230:02.47]In my opinion, $7.32 is a good... Yeah.
[230:04.39]I'll take it.
[230:04.75]What is this shit?
[230:12.00]Oh, that.
[230:14.84]Oh, do I have plastic stuff over here?
[230:16.02]This is not pla- Alright, this is all sold.
[230:19.98]Do I have anything plastic?
[230:25.35]Do I need to hold on to this stuff?
[230:29.33]This is plastic, but this is an ID card.
[230:31.51]I kind of want to keep that for some reason, right?
[230:36.13]Display the Mona Lisa.
[230:41.25]Didn't it say to wait and not display it because an artist might come in and pay a ton of money for it?
[230:46.63]Pay the debt back.
[230:48.67]I'm going to right now.
[230:53.74]Right after this.
[230:56.32]He's not around here, is he?
[230:57.42]I don't want to be associated with him.
[231:00.14]I found this at home.
[231:01.22]How much can I get for it?
[231:03.80]Sculpture.
[231:06.24]I thought you're not accepting items anymore.
[231:07.65]I didn't see much stuff on the showcase.
[231:09.21]It's because I'm just selling shit.
[231:12.63]Alright.
[231:15.47]You're right.
[231:15.81]It's in perfect condition.
[231:17.91]Material seems to be made out of... Oh.
[231:24.63]Surgical steel.
[231:28.76]Worth a little bit more money.
[231:33.41]Alright.
[231:33.95]What about date?
[231:36.49]2080.
[231:36.51]Nothing significant there.
[231:39.07]And is there a signature on it?
[231:39.99]There is.
[231:41.69]Who signed this?
[231:42.37]Okay.
[231:50.85]Signed by Han Huang.
[231:55.75]Weren't they just talking about this?
[231:59.92]Alright.
[232:00.08]This is a, um, a businessman.
[232:00.74]And he's a criminal.
[232:01.88]Oh shit, he's a criminal.
[232:04.17]He's a criminal.
[232:04.49]But he's an artist.
[232:32.28]Holy shit.
[232:35.51]And, not only that, but this shit brings good luck.
[232:46.97]What the hell is a chippy, by the way?
[232:48.51]This is worth a lot of fucking money.
[232:51.59]Alright, what do I offer for this?
[233:04.19]Alright, loan's gone.
[233:06.47]Uh, what do I offer for this?
[233:08.26]600?
[233:11.80]I don't think I can start at 500.
[233:12.52]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, 600, 600, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[233:16.92]No, not 60, 600.
[233:17.14]60!
[233:17.18]No, fuck, I don't have any money!
[233:17.92]Oh, shit!
[233:18.12]No, no, no, no, no.
[233:31.56]I don't have enough money!
[233:32.40]I just paid the fucking loan!
[233:34.96]Shit!
[233:36.14]Will you take $280?
[233:37.00]Come on, you know that's not enough.
[233:42.06]Fuck!
[233:43.72]Wait, get a loan.
[233:48.77]God damn it.
[233:50.55]God damn it.
[233:51.57]I can't.
[233:52.35]$280?
[233:52.41]Will you take $284?
[233:53.09]I want this so bad.
[233:55.79]I want this on my store.
[233:57.37]I want this on my shop.
[233:59.45]I don't think that's enough.
[234:00.03]I'm sorry, but... I want this.
[234:07.29]Chat totally fucked him here.
[234:08.97]You did.
[234:09.51]You know what?
[234:10.03]You did.
[234:10.35]I was... Pay the loan down.
[234:12.79]I've never listened to... Just leave.
[234:14.84]Enjoy your, like, $1,500 you're gonna sell that for.
[234:17.36]Thank you.
[234:17.64]Hello.
[234:23.98]Hello.
[234:28.90]Oh, I must have surprised you.
[234:31.56]Easy, easy.
[234:32.04]I'm a human being just like you.
[234:35.72]You're Yeon Ji Mo, the actor, right?
[234:39.06]You got that right.
[234:42.04]Wait, I'm here as a mere customer, so treat me like you would to others.
[234:45.24]But I can't buy this.
[234:47.34]This is the doll guy.
[234:52.16]Alright, first of all, this thing is in dog shit condition.
[234:56.02]This is damaged.
[235:00.78]Things are a bit strict, yeah.
[235:01.94]It's in dog shit condition.
[235:04.10]What's it made out of?
[235:04.72]Hmm.
[235:07.77]Cotton.
[235:08.53]You think it's made out of velvet?
[235:10.17]Cotton, actually.
[235:13.11]To be honest, I wasn't really sure about that part.
[235:15.55]Well, you should be now.
[235:18.19]2075.
[235:20.01]Nothing significant here, and you signed it.
[235:22.00]What is that worth?
[235:22.62]You're an actor.
[235:23.14]Is that worth something?
[235:25.22]I don't know.
[235:28.14]Are you even on this list?
[235:32.01]No, you're not even on this list.
[235:33.01]You're not even a celebrity.
[235:36.30]Oh yeah, you are.
[235:41.40]An actor.
[235:41.90]Famous for being a narcissist.
[235:43.22]Youngsters like him.
[235:44.50]Okay.
[235:45.62]So you're an actor.
[235:46.44]Alright, sure.
[235:47.03]Sure.
[235:49.57]Fine.
[235:52.19]Uh, you're an actor.
[235:52.91]Business politician, jeweler, journalist, athlete, activist.
[235:57.71]Mere celebrity.
[236:02.86]I mean, you know, an artist?
[236:07.57]Would you be an artist?
[236:12.47]A mere artist?
[236:15.82]He's fake.
[236:16.68]Is it a fake?
[236:17.28]No, it's not.
[236:19.90]That's accurate.
[236:24.94]An actor.
[236:25.36]Famous for being a narcissist.
[236:29.28]I'm going to say artist, right?
[236:32.18]Does that make sense?
[236:33.78]Or does it not matter?
[236:36.62]Artist.
[236:38.12]A signature of an artist.
[236:39.56]I know, I know.
[236:40.12]Oh, it's already on there.
[236:42.82]Oops.
[236:48.72]Okay, well, here's a young generation like you.
[236:50.14]But what do I care?
[236:58.80]I'll give you $30.
[236:59.20]I'm a star who really cherishes his fans, so I'll kindly accept your offer.
[237:15.53]A young person is going to come in here and want this.
[237:23.58]Alright, goodbye.
[237:26.32]Have a nice day.
[237:30.51]That was his catchphrase.
[237:32.21]I'm going to put this on display right now.
[237:40.92]I still have this fucking Mona Lisa.
[237:42.30]Put this over here.
[237:42.80]I thought that was a joint.
[237:48.78]Where are the art people to buy my paintings?
[237:53.99]Hello, can you take a look at this artwork?
[237:56.99]He made this sculpture when in his prime.
[237:59.33]Unfortunately, he is now a fixie.
[238:01.79]It's a work of the deceased.
[238:04.01]Indeed it is.
[238:04.57]Okay, is it a chocolate rabbit?
[238:09.42]I'm sorry, dude.
[238:10.06]Fucking, like, Reese's comes out with these every year.
[238:12.00]This is worth, like, four dollars.
[238:15.98]Um, that's slightly damaged.
[238:17.28]It's fine.
[238:21.63]It's wood.
[238:23.33]This is made out of wood.
[238:24.21]Yeah, you already have that.
[238:26.29]Okay.
[238:26.55]2064.
[238:26.65]No.

[238:35.28]You did.
[238:37.48]Okay.
[238:38.20]Dongjun Lee, a sculptor and animal lover.
[238:40.46]He spent his artistic heyday during 2058 to 2067.
[238:44.98]Recently became a fixie.
[238:46.06]He's being considered as dead.
[238:47.36]Okay.

[239:27.53]Okay, I'm just gonna make him an offer.
[239:29.95]I'm not gonna put this on here.
[239:45.98]What about the appraisal?
[239:46.80]Shouldn't you finish it?
[239:47.42]Don't forget to check the artwork section.
[239:49.40]Oh, fuck off.
[239:53.50]I can't buy this.
[239:58.44]Well, I'll appraise it for you, so maybe you'll make some money.
[240:00.96]God damn it.
[240:05.48]Whatever.
[240:05.76]There you go.
[240:10.98]It's by a deceased artist.
[240:12.04]It's worth $2,800.
[240:30.08]What?
[240:33.52]You can take it?
[240:36.02]Yeah, you don't know.
[240:37.50]It could be worth whatever.
[240:41.05]It's worth $250, man.
[240:44.91]Usually this stubborn... Yeah, why don't we just stop here?
[240:47.43]I want to stop talking to a wall.
[240:50.15]Oh, whatever.
[240:51.07]I don't have enough money.
[240:51.91]Why did I even pay the loan back?
[240:54.22]I would have been able to have so much more inventory.
[240:57.16]Never listening to chat ever again.
[241:02.60]This is Nightingale's socks.
[241:06.95]Certificate of Legacy of Nightingale, second degree.
[241:08.87]We hereby guarantee that this item was used by Nightingale.
[241:14.33]Um... They're damaged?
[241:18.19]What are they made out of?
[241:21.62]Cotton?
[241:22.30]That's not velvet.
[241:26.99]Oh, it was never on my... Why would I want to, like... 1905?
[241:30.84]I mean, that's... But it's historic.
[241:34.76]Okay.
[241:39.68]Historic socks.
[241:42.08]And they're signed, too, which is kind of weird.
[241:45.08]But this is gonna be worth, like, a thousand dollars!
[241:49.92]Who signed it?
[241:55.88]Ugh.
[241:59.36]I can't see this.
[242:00.28]I don't see this on here.
[242:01.02]This is not real.
[242:14.59]Okay, so it's fake.
[242:18.37]Or there's no signature for it.
[242:21.33]Unidentifiable autograph.
[242:31.46]It's a great figure in world history?
[242:34.61]Great fig- I don't know.
[242:38.97]Is it fake?
[242:39.85]It's a great figure in world history.
[242:42.49]It has a certificate though.
[242:46.08]Yeah, that makes sense.
[242:50.10]Fuck!
[242:51.38]But I can't buy it!
[243:05.48]Smile.
[243:10.72]Why did I pay the loan back?
[243:13.17]Everybody's freaking out for me to pay the goddamn loan.
[243:17.81]You idiot!
[243:18.43]You're gonna pay the loan!
[243:19.23]It's never gonna go!
[243:19.99]And now I can't even buy any new inventory.
[243:24.94]I can't get another one.
[243:29.58]Just leave.
[243:30.10]Just fucking leave.
[243:38.50]I'd like to buy the eco-friendly shoulder bag.
[243:41.60]Please.
[243:42.62]That's $380.
[243:42.84]That's not quite much.
[243:46.49]$304.
[243:46.51]You know what?
[243:46.83]I'm desperate for money.
[243:47.59]Just take it.
[243:51.73]Sell some stuff?
[243:52.37]I can't sell anything until somebody comes in to buy something.
[243:56.37]It's not like a sell button.
[243:57.62]Put the painting on display?
[244:01.10]No.
[244:01.42]Because an artist is going to come in and want one.
[244:06.51]This is my mom.
[244:07.41]I painted it myself.
[244:08.49]Okay.
[244:09.41]My mom's a little sick lately and she stays in bed all day, but she used to smile like this.
[244:13.14]So pretty.
[244:15.58]If you buy this off me, I'll buy some flowers and gift them to my mom.
[244:19.08]This would be... Uh... Yeah, I mean, this is just... What do you want me to do with this?
[244:26.06]It is in slight... It's in pretty good condition.
[244:29.64]It's in pretty good condition, but it's damaged.
[244:35.00]And it's made out of
[244:38.02]Canvas.
[244:39.48]It's made it a canvas.
[244:42.72]Uh-huh.
[244:44.62]It was painted in 2080.
[244:47.83]No significance.
[244:48.53]Did you sign it?
[244:49.29]You did.
[244:52.43]Um, but your signature's not on here.
[244:54.49]Sorry, you're not a celebrity or anything.
[244:58.66]This looks like it was Love You Mommy.
[245:00.68]This is a foot painting?
[245:01.40]Yeah, this looks like a foot painting.
[245:04.86]This is a failed piece.
[245:09.81]Oh, I got it wrong then, yeah.
[245:12.83]Uh, you did paint this during your prime.
[245:15.15]Okay, so I don't really want this.
[245:22.22]I'm just gonna offer you, like, I'll offer you $5 for it. $15.
[245:41.00]But that's not what I expected.
[245:42.26]Can you offer me a bit more?
[245:44.68]You bring in a painting that you did with your feet of your mom.
[245:48.31]And you want more than $15 for it?
[245:49.93]$20 for it?
[245:50.57]What do you want me to do?
[245:58.26]No.
[245:58.70]Alright.
[246:00.66]No, what?
[246:06.02]This is as high as I'm gonna go for this.
[246:09.42]How many more times should we repeat this?
[246:11.28]Why don't we just stop here?
[246:14.10]I don't want this painting.
[246:24.65]Lower it back to 15.
[246:25.65]Can you take a good look at this?
[246:28.94]Yeah.
[246:30.70]I don't really want to let it go, but my wife has been pushing me so hard to sell this.
[246:34.56]Okay.
[246:35.24]It's a fantastic hoverboard.
[246:37.44]By brand.
[246:39.37]Alright, let's take a look.
[246:41.83]Damaged.
[246:45.13]So that's not worth what you think it is.
[246:47.16]What's it made out of?
[246:47.88]It's made out of some weird material here.
[246:49.82]This is, I think, an authentic brand.
[246:58.44]Okay, the brand is Vertivo.
[247:00.48]Let's see, Vertivo.
[247:05.60]That's authentic Vertivo material.
[247:08.81]It is.
[247:10.19]And this is their VTV steel.
[247:12.67]Oh, you're right.
[247:13.71]It's authentic.
[247:14.29]Yeah, okay.
[247:16.87]Popular item, too.
[247:17.93]Alright.
[247:20.05]Anybody sign this?
[247:22.43]This does have a signature on it.
[247:25.33]From that actor guy.
[247:28.03]Wait, hold on.
[247:28.41]What's the date?
[247:28.79]2073.
[247:29.35]Nothing significant.
[247:41.35]2073.
[247:41.57]Nothing.
[247:46.11]But this actor, wait, is it actually the signature or did you fake it?
[247:51.61]It's got an artist's signature on it.
[247:53.21]Soar out of reach.
[248:03.50]Soar out of reach for TiVo.
[248:06.40]BT 2073.

[248:19.47]It's already listed there, for dolphin-like shapes.
[248:21.71]However, the royals say these, those produced before 2068 are ugly.

[249:11.36]Artist.
[249:12.94]That's the signature of an artist.
[249:14.56]Fuck!
[249:21.21]No!
[249:30.96]I mean, I have...
[249:36.58]Bring it down.
[249:40.55]Okay.
[249:42.33]I have 500 bucks.
[249:43.41]You don't have to fully appraise it?
[249:46.87]The last time I didn't fully... This is why... Okay, I'm gonna give you another criticism of this game.
[249:50.91]So, if I don't have to fully appraise things, then the last time I tried to not fully appraise something, the lady said, you didn't fully appraise it.
[250:01.00]Why not?
[250:01.88]And I had to fully appraise it anyways.
[250:08.80]Like, can I actually do that?
[250:10.52]Some customers are just dicks.
[250:18.29]You have to fully appraise for your reputation.
[250:20.35]You can't buy everything.
[250:23.51]Huh.
[250:25.95]Sometimes they don't notice.
[250:28.71]Oh, well, I don't know.
[250:32.30]Alright, let's start at 550 bucks.
[250:37.73]It's a mere celebrity?
[250:38.75]Well, I don't want to make the price more expensive.
[250:47.45]I'm going to do 500.
[250:47.79]Give it to me.
[250:51.65]Would you please make me... This thing deserves more of your attention.
[251:06.54]Ah...
[251:08.49]Well, I don't want to fully appraise it because I won't be able to afford it.
[251:17.86]Why did I pay the loan back?
[251:19.72]That was the worst decision I've made the entire game.
[251:21.68]Uh, make sure that I can get at least one of the two items.
[251:27.49]What does he want?
[251:28.17]He wanted, um... What does he want?
[251:31.37]What does this guy want?
[251:36.31]He wanted, like, the ID card?
[251:37.31]What did he want?
[251:42.91]Exactly.
[251:43.55]How much is it?
[251:45.05]Um... Let's see, 100 bucks?
[251:53.79]That's not what I can afford.
[251:55.01]Can you please cut it to 68?
[251:55.91]Alright, well this is a quest item, so just take it and leave.
[251:58.24]I need my time cinema.
[252:06.74]Okay.
[252:25.04]No.
[252:26.61]What do you mean no?
[252:29.27]1500?
[252:29.41]What should I put it up there for?
[252:31.31]Too low?
[252:34.91]More?
[252:35.25]This is the Mona Lisa. 2000?
[252:43.22]Alright, I'll do 2,000.
[252:44.96]2,000 and then 200 for this one.
[252:47.61]It was my birthday present.
[252:56.57]Can you please tell me how much it's worth?
[252:58.45]Sweet pocket mommy.
[253:02.32]It's a pocket mommy.
[253:03.38]Put pocket mommy in your pocket.
[253:04.52]She will nag you for 24 hours a day.
[253:06.18]Okay.
[253:11.91]Oh, it's made out of plastic.
[253:15.89]This week's target material.
[253:16.97]The price has gone up.
[253:17.77]Hey, yeah.
[253:18.45]By the way, this is made out of plastic.
[253:20.23]I just made it more expensive for myself.
[253:23.71]But I have to tell them.
[253:25.46]This game, I'm confused about how this game works sometimes.
[253:30.26]Because if you don't fully appraise something, they say to fully appraise it.
[253:33.20]But, like, I have to do some appraisals.
[253:35.70]Like, I have to do some of the stuff.
[253:36.72]I don't understand.
[253:39.80]Alright, 2074.
[253:42.00]What is this?
[253:42.46]The first... Is this significant?
[253:49.15]Is this a tracker?
[253:49.85]I wonder if this is a tracker.
[254:06.75]Don't worry about me.
[254:07.59]I can wait as long.
[254:09.23]Is it right?
[254:09.81]Is it wrong?
[254:14.01]Not a tracker?
[254:14.75]I mean, it's a pocket mummy?
[254:16.37]That sounds like a tracking device.
[254:18.86]Alright, well, don't be mad.
[254:24.12]2074, whatever.
[254:25.42]No signature on it.
[254:26.80]It's just whatever slightly damaged piece of plastic.
[254:29.60]Okay.
[254:31.86]I'll give you $250 for it.
[254:39.38]Thank you.
[254:40.10]Alright, now put this up immediately and sell it.
[254:45.01]Put it up for 365.
[254:46.05]Hell yeah.
[254:47.71]I'm going to be easy with this one.
[254:49.21]400.
[254:52.93]My pocket mommy is not a historical item.
[254:57.47]You're an expert.
[254:58.06]Can you find something?
[255:00.14]Painting.
[255:00.56]Happy tears of a crocodile.
[255:01.80]Alright, who did this?
[255:05.38]I'm not going to correct you because I want to buy it.
[255:09.55]This is not even canvas.
[255:10.27]What is this?
[255:13.61]Paper.
[255:13.95]Yeah, that's fine.
[255:16.33]2069.
[255:17.61]Oh, alright.
[255:18.05]Who signed it?
[255:18.91]Who did this?
[255:19.31]Croco is happy today, like always.
[255:22.14]Okay.
[255:30.14]Yin Zhong Li, a painter.
[255:31.48]Alright.
[255:33.44]In protest against the Fix Room Project in 2079, she donated umbrellas with her signature on them to citizens.
[255:39.86]She became a fixie recently.
[255:41.20]Alright, so that's got an artist on it.
[255:47.77]I know.
[255:48.07]I'm looking at it.
[255:49.13]I'm looking at it.
[255:51.47]I'm looking at it.
[255:52.35]I'm looking at it right now.
[255:53.51]Will you give me a minute?
[255:55.43]Okay, so... Deceased?
[255:57.15]Deceased?
[256:01.33]Became a Fixie recently.
[256:02.39]Does that mean she's dead?
[256:07.41]Well, it's an artist, so let's put that on here.
[256:17.34]Okay, good.
[256:19.20]I'll buy it.
[256:21.60]I'll make you an offer.
[256:25.78]I'll give you $175 for it.
[256:29.98]Pixies are dead.
[256:31.44]Yeah, but if I say that, I won't be able to buy it.
[256:33.24]Okay, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[256:40.07]That'll make it worth like $2,000.
[256:43.07]I can't afford it.
[256:43.63]Alright, uh, the end of the day.
[256:54.16]Alright, I only have 200 bucks.
[257:00.68]They're planning to test run the artificial rain tomorrow afternoon.
[257:03.50]The forecast for tomorrow is sunny, but rainy in the afternoon.
[257:05.68]I feel like I'm going to be so lonely tonight, but I'll let you go, Bob.
[257:10.59]Toodle-oo.
[257:15.89]Repair shop downstairs will open tomorrow.
[257:18.87]Useful place.
[257:20.06]Ooh, so yeah, I can repair my hoverboard.
[257:22.48]Oh!
[257:32.25]And then I can sell it for like 5,000.
[257:33.19]Or 2,000, whatever it is.
[257:37.11]45 bucks, alright.
[257:37.63]I'm just gonna check every toilet, whatever, uh, recycling bin.
[257:41.47]For money.
[257:43.62]Honest to God.
[257:46.00]It's more efficient than selling items.
[257:55.16]What was it?
[257:58.11]Holy shit!
[258:01.50]I can sell this for like 300 bucks.
[258:05.86]What on Earth do you know about my father?
[258:07.44]I didn't say anything wrong.
[258:10.27]Yeah, my dad is a fixie now.
[258:11.51]So what?
[258:11.99]You're gonna fix him back?
[258:12.91]This is just drama I don't want to pay attention to.
[258:20.09]Nothing in there.
[258:20.55]Alright, I want to go down.
[258:30.36]Lucky me.
[258:34.22]From a different brand, adds 20.
[258:35.63]Dude, I can sell that for probably like 50 bucks.
[258:37.75]Can I start now?
[258:43.81]Are you hiding yet?
[258:50.16]Mild gamer neck spotted.
[258:51.88]Yeah, I mean, that's... I would consider that a little more substantial.
[259:05.44]Mild gamer neck.
[259:12.98]I don't know if I'd call that mild gamer neck as much as I would say that's mild shaggy.
[259:20.79]You'll come here to get the treatment tomorrow.
[259:22.25]Okay, sweetie.
[259:27.97]Union against fixation.
[259:29.15]Okay.
[259:30.99]Come join us.
[259:31.49]Shout with us.
[259:34.78]Um, sure.
[259:35.36]Let's go.
[259:36.27]Stop this fixed rain.
[259:38.53]It's fucking us all up.
[259:43.17]What happened?
[259:44.01]Oh, what?
[259:44.59]Did I fall asleep?
[259:48.83]Alright.
[259:50.17]Uh, I met Yeonji Moo in person who Mary put on the blacklist.
[259:55.60]Professor Choi came back wishing I'd give him an ID card and I did.
[260:00.14]And I paid some interest.
[260:07.33]What levels of gamer neck are there?
[260:09.55]There's... Shaggy is considered pretty mild.
[260:13.36]And it goes all the way to Dark Crystal Skeksy.
[260:17.22]So, there's a spectrum there somewhere in the middle.
[260:28.45]You know what?
[260:28.85]There's four types of loafers in this world.
[260:32.57]Good loafer, bad loafer, rich loafer, mindless loafer.
[260:36.09]Which type are you?
[260:47.49]Where am I on the gamer neck spectrum?
[260:51.13]Um... I don't know.
[260:57.44]I mean, I feel like... If you have a gamer neck and you have a big Adam's apple... Like, it's like you get double whammied.
[261:03.88]I have a pretty big Adam's apple.
[261:05.79]So, like, it looks like... I kind of look like a turkey sometimes.
[261:16.42]Show yourself.
[261:19.62]Well, hold on.
[261:20.94]Am I decent?
[261:23.98]I'm decent.
[261:26.00]Uh, so if you see what I'm talking about here.
[261:27.22]This.
[261:34.83]So, hi.
[261:37.01]You like my Adam's apple?
[261:38.09]Like it's pretty big up here.
[261:40.75]So if the Adam's apple is large, then you end up like a scenario like this, right?
[261:45.03]With this juts out far.
[261:46.67]And if you have your neck kind of cocked like this, it looks kind of like you have like a gobbler here.
[261:51.38]See how big my Adam's apple area is?
[261:53.04]That's how I'm able to go like this.
[262:05.39]Yeah, I got a big Adam's apple and a big vocal, uh, uh, whatever they are.
[262:11.56]That's how I'm able to do that.
[262:16.18]Car noise.
[262:16.84]It's like a... Grr, grr, grr.
[262:25.25]Grr, grr, grr, grr.
[262:28.21]Grr, grr, grr, grr.
[262:29.05]Grr, grr, grr, grr.
[262:29.89]Grr, grr, grr, grr.
[262:30.55]Grr, grr, grr, grr.
[262:31.35]Grr, grr, grr, grr.
[262:32.09]Grr, grr, grr, grr.
[262:45.19]Stop what I'm doing things Wait the repair shop There's nothing in this trash
[263:02.77]Repair shop is open.
[263:03.53]Alright, let me repair some of the stuff.
[263:05.69]Welcome to First Repair.
[263:06.53]We take care of every stuff as warmly as childcare.
[263:10.43]That was kind of an odd sentence.
[263:12.71]I can repair items that are fairly damaged or worse.
[263:14.62]Slight damages may remain, though.
[263:15.96]Okay.
[263:16.72]My repair service is mostly done in no time, but it takes another day if the damage is really serious.
[263:22.10]Uh, 50 bucks.
[263:25.51]Okay.
[263:26.79]Some of the items that need repair.
[263:29.61]Um, well, first of all, this.
[263:31.30]This is, like, really damaged.
[263:32.88]Okay.
[263:37.62]So that.
[263:39.42]How damaged is this?
[263:40.44]This is damaged, too.
[263:41.32]What about that one?
[263:42.72]And this one, too.
[263:45.14]Uh, can I only do two items at once?
[263:46.28]Alright, how about that?
[263:47.08]Show.
[263:48.17]I can fix your picked-up emotion tracker right away, and I need one more knight to fix your picked-up hoverboard.
[263:53.31]120 bucks?
[263:54.73]Sounds good.
[264:05.45]You want to pressure Bowser?
[264:06.49]Okay.
[264:11.62]I'm going to come back tomorrow.
[264:12.64]Okay.
[264:13.04]I will.
[264:24.98]And now what's that worth?
[264:27.79]Nice.
[264:28.29]That's worth it.
[264:40.56]Alright, let's go.
[264:42.48]That was the worst impression.
[264:43.54]No, it was not.
[264:46.46]Good morning!
[264:51.14]Wait!
[264:51.52]Before you say anything.
[264:57.73]Four hundred.
[265:00.31]What else needs to go up here?
[265:01.31]Ah, it's just a stupid lamp.
[265:02.91]Whatever.
[265:03.17]Alright.
[265:09.08]Alright.
[265:14.71]That sounded like a bathroom sink that had... Sorry for your trouble.
[265:17.31]What?
[265:19.71]What just happened?
[265:21.97]What just happened?
[265:24.80]How much is a picked up emotion tracker?
[265:29.20]Prepared.
[265:30.32]You're not really selling this for 400.
[265:31.76]I just picked up from the trash.
[265:34.52]I'll buy it right away.
[265:35.38]Are you okay?
[265:37.36]That's still a lot of money.
[265:38.36]That sounds good.
[265:43.73]Thanks.
[265:51.12]Oh, he gave me the umbrella.
[265:52.14]Okay.
[265:54.52]Hey, how's it going?
[265:56.28]How are you?
[265:56.66]Can you give me a second to catch my breath?
[265:58.77]From home, I kept running.
[266:01.13]Can you take a look at this?
[266:03.63]Well, it's quite obvious what's told in this article.
[266:08.69]Who's setting the reselling prices, by the way?
[266:10.78]They're higher than I expected.
[266:11.80]$11 will do.
[266:14.64]Um, well, hold on.
[266:18.32]This thing is in really shitty condition.
[266:20.56]It's made out of, um, paper.
[266:23.44]You got that correct.
[266:25.96]In 2061.
[266:28.56]On for good.
[266:29.74]Nothing in 2061.
[266:32.88]And what's signed, though?
[266:34.34]Who is it signed by?
[266:35.20]It's signed by Gong... Gong In-oh.
[266:41.62]He used to write highly objective articles that people thought he equipped himself with a potato chip.
[266:49.14]Is this a journalist?
[266:53.42]Oh, this is fake.
[266:55.12]It's fake.
[266:55.44]Yeah, this is fake, dude.
[267:03.21]Uh, this is a fake piece.
[267:04.63]How do I... Where's the... Where's the celebrity list?
[267:08.79]This is, uh, fake.
[267:16.47]It's a fake autograph.
[267:18.78]Okay, so this is worthless.
[267:23.26]Get out of my store.
[267:33.93]Smart guy.
[267:34.53]Good gamer.
[267:35.07]Thanks.
[267:38.81]Where's my birthday present?
[267:39.91]People keep bringing their birthday presents here.
[267:42.75]Einstein's Chalk.
[267:45.00]Certificate of Legacy of Einstein.
[267:47.74]We hereby guarantee that this item was used by Einstein.
[267:53.24]That's fair.
[267:53.80]I'm going to say that's fairly damaged.
[267:56.68]I mean, well, it's not perfect.
[268:02.50]Okay.
[268:04.56]Seems to be made out of... It's wood.
[268:07.40]You've got that correct at least.
[268:08.78]It's from the 1911.
[268:09.30]Interesting.
[268:14.26]This has some archaeological value.
[268:19.45]Never on my mind, alright, but... Is that Albert Einstein's signature?
[268:33.88]It's not on here, but... It's got a certificate.
[268:42.82]I mean, it has a certificate, right?
[268:46.56]Great, I can't afford if it's a great figure, though.
[268:49.76]If I say this is a great historical figure, then I'm going to literally, it's gonna be like times, it's gonna be $800.
[268:55.35]Yeah, there's an autograph on it, I know.
[269:05.21]Unidentifiable, fake, it's unidentifiable, but...
[269:11.07]um scholar no no this is a this is this is a fucking this is Albert Einstein this is literally Albert Einstein now I can get this for 450 bucks
[269:40.25]Although, it's unidentifiable, though.
[269:45.35]It's... Wait, what?
[269:55.59]Um... It has a certificate.
[269:58.75]Okay, I'm gonna... I'll give you 50 bucks.
[270:01.51]How does that sound?
[270:04.42]I'll give you $50.
[270:04.92]Will you take 50 bucks?
[270:09.74]I'll give you 50 bucks.
[270:14.76]Alright, fuck yeah, let's go.
[270:23.73]Picked up glass on the showcase.
[270:25.03]How much is that worth?
[270:25.83]Uh, that'd be 30 bucks.
[270:29.53]I'm not an idiot.
[270:31.07]To buy something picked up from trash for 30 dollars.
[270:33.17]Alright, fine.
[270:39.03]Streamer's foaming at the mouth over his pawn shop.
[270:42.72]Erase the signature on it.
[270:43.78]Excuse me, can I have an umbrella?
[270:50.36]It's urgent.
[270:52.52]We can't sell umbrellas.
[270:55.06]But I need it before I take my mom home.
[270:57.12]She already suffered from pneumonia.
[270:58.42]If she gets rained again, she'll be in real danger.
[271:03.55]She's gone to work not to lose her job.
[271:05.73]The company didn't allow her to take a day off.
[271:08.76]Please, let me buy an umbrella, just one.
[271:14.16]I can't.
[271:17.36]I don't have it.
[271:17.88]I can't do it.
[271:21.56]I can't do it.
[271:23.71]I can't do it.
[271:30.93]I like to buy the doll of me over there.
[271:32.87]How much is a doll of me?
[271:34.41]Oh, that one.
[271:37.44]Doesn't seem to be worth that much.
[271:38.70]In my opinion, 46 is fine.
[271:41.20]I want this thing out of my store anyways.
[271:48.81]If that gets tracked back to me, then I'm gonna go- I get arrested.
[271:54.20]How's this guy?
[271:54.66]Thank you for being at the protest yesterday, Bob.
[271:58.00]I heard AVAC is finally noticing our work.
[272:00.58]Since we all made one voice, AVAC will definitely let out any reaction.
[272:05.71]This evening will be especially crucial.
[272:07.99]I heard there will be a test running for an artificial rainfall.
[272:11.37]This evening, we must protest with one voice.
[272:13.97]So please make sure to come out this evening, too.
[272:16.11]Let's make a change.
[272:16.89]What if it's going to rain on us?
[272:24.13]Hi, are you the manager who's in charge of collecting umbrellas?
[272:28.29]About that job, I wanted to ask if you'd like to sell umbrellas to me, not AVAC.
[272:33.49]What?
[272:34.45]I just don't like to see people blindly obey orders.
[272:37.31]I want to show AVAC that we're not just their puppets.
[272:39.44]If I don't, AVAC will never give up on stepping on us.
[272:45.30]Don't worry about getting caught, by the way.
[272:47.14]I won't use the umbrellas nor talk about anything that happened between us.
[272:51.14]And I can pay you 150 bucks for each.
[272:53.69]It's even more than you get paid by them.
[272:57.79]This could be a lie.
[273:04.42]I'm gonna get arrested.
[273:10.50]No, I can't.
[273:11.04]I don't know.
[273:12.93]What if this guy works for them?
[273:15.63]That's a huge offer.
[273:17.79]I don't think it's worth it.
[273:18.89]This could be an AVAC user.
[273:22.57]This is a fixer.
[273:23.45]Yeah.
[273:23.99]I don't... Nope.
[273:24.73]Not gonna happen.
[273:26.19]Can't trust anybody.
[273:29.07]Are you afraid to disobey?
[273:30.11]No, I'm afraid to, like, give what is absolutely you our AVAC.
[273:35.05]I don't want to, like... You're gonna turn me in.
[273:36.23]That was way too much money.
[273:39.95]For that not to be fake.
[273:43.26]I'd like to buy the Masterpiece La Gioconda over there.
[273:46.38]$2,000.
[273:48.14]This is crazy.
[273:50.39]Who pays $2,000?
[273:50.81]Oh, fuck off.
[273:57.37]This is appraised at $900.
[273:58.41]I'm not gonna get out of here.
[274:05.05]It was not a bad offer?
[274:06.14]Yes, it was.
[274:06.84]It was appraised for $1,000.
[274:07.46]Leave.
[274:13.73]You know, Professor Choi?
[274:14.61]You know, that idiot.
[274:17.53]That guy doing a one-man protest and causing a ruckus.
[274:20.37]I wanted to see what his living conditions were like, so I went to his house and the security was so bad.
[274:24.44]I found this was just lying on the ground.
[274:28.86]Oh, wait.
[274:30.18]It's that thing.
[274:33.00]A long time ago, Troy was talking about a time machine or a time capsule or something.
[274:36.16]He boasted about how he made a machine that looked... Let me read it!
[274:40.46]I wanted to use it, so I stole it.
[274:42.48]But I can't figure out how to use it for the life of me.
[274:45.62]So I'm just going to sell it for a low price.
[274:47.80]Okay.
[274:48.02]Uh, let's see.
[274:51.46]It's in, uh... Should I just, like, who cares and just buy it?
[274:55.41]Because he just wants it.
[274:56.13]I'm sure it's real.
[275:04.60]The world's fastest travel with Professor Choi.
[275:06.36]Yeah, that's, that's correct.
[275:12.21]Yeah, I'm just gonna buy it.
[275:12.87]I don't wanna, I'm not gonna tell you what it's worth.
[275:14.23]This is just, he just wants it.
[275:15.13]Okay, I'll give you 120 bucks for it.
[275:21.06]Yeah, I don't wanna, I don't wanna appraise it.
[275:31.66]But like, I have to appraise sometimes.
[275:33.52]It's kind of confusing.
[275:36.05]How much is the masterpiece?
[275:37.99]$2,000.
[275:38.17]Something must be wrong.
[275:42.56]I'll buy it right away if it's $942.
[275:44.20]Fuck.
[275:45.20]I need that money.
[275:59.49]Can't do counter offers.
[276:02.35]No.
[276:07.85]I'm waiting for at least a thousand.
[276:10.35]It's the Mona Lisa.
[276:12.41]I know, that's why I'm holding out.
[276:15.36]In a week.
[276:16.22]Last time I didn't know you just came back from Bluebird.
[276:19.12]I did think you were really getting what's... I did think you were not really getting what was happening.
[276:22.74]By the way, why did you come back from Bluebird?
[276:25.90]You must have been aware that fixed rain would come down soon.
[276:28.07]Am I wrong?
[276:28.51]If you don't like to answer, please don't bother.
[276:32.35]Have you got any umbrellas this week anyway?
[276:36.27]I do.
[276:37.13]Got two of them.
[276:38.50]Sent you 50 each.
[276:40.56]There's one more thing I really want you to know, by the way.
[276:45.76]How did you make it to Bluebird 10 years ago?
[276:49.12]They didn't have the lucky passport event back then, did they?
[276:52.62]And what did you do over there for 10 years?
[276:56.78]Lady, I have amnesia.
[276:59.08]I woke up in an old guy's bed and he told me I was his fake son.
[277:03.80]I don't know anything.
[277:07.01]You really get on my nerves.
[277:15.74]I woke up in like an old guy's apartment.
[277:17.42]Or maybe that was my apartment.
[277:21.49]Movie script.
[277:25.33]This is bad condition.
[277:29.67]This is very bad.
[277:32.39]Um, I would say it's probably fairly damaged though.
[277:35.93]So I don't think it's that brutal.
[277:43.48]Although let's see if it's made out of, what is it made out of paper?
[277:46.04]Yeah.
[277:47.22]Here's the kicker though.
[277:48.06]When was this made?
[277:49.78]Oh no, this is not like, alright.
[277:51.44]2076.
[277:51.46]Significance.
[277:57.50]And, oh, it's this guy.
[277:59.24]It's like an actor.
[278:02.58]Actor.
[278:03.26]Famous for being a narcissist.
[278:04.68]It's his script.
[278:09.21]He just drew all over it.
[278:13.29]Okay, well, it's an artist.
[278:18.31]Where is the celebrity types?
[278:20.21]It's a picture of an artist.
[278:24.13]And I know exactly who it is.
[278:27.63]And young people are going to love it.
[278:31.56]But, at the end of the day, it's still kind of rough around the edges.
[278:37.10]I'll give you 20 bucks for it.
[278:38.44]35.
[278:38.46]30.
[278:38.48]30.
[278:38.50]32.
[278:45.43]Fine.
[278:45.53]Okay.
[279:01.50]Why do you keep calling the guy an artist?
[279:02.88]It's triggering.
[279:04.26]Because I don't make the rules of the game.
[279:08.06]Hi.
[279:09.48]Sniff.
[279:09.96]Sorry, I have a cold after the rain last week.
[279:12.74]I found this at home.
[279:13.64]How much can I get for it?
[279:16.53]Picked it up on the beach.
[279:17.25]Alright, this is Bob here too.
[279:18.77]Oh, it's nothing.
[279:20.45]Alright, this definitely has a signature on it.
[279:22.01]Alright, let's see.
[279:23.33]It's in shitty condition.
[279:27.37]This is in bad condition.
[279:30.53]Make sure it's accurately made out of this.
[279:32.29]What is it made out of?
[279:32.91]Cotton?
[279:33.75]Not made out of velvet.
[279:35.31]Sorry.
[279:39.82]2035.
[279:40.96]Brutal city fire.
[279:45.78]Although, like, it has no, uh, whatever.
[279:48.07]Alright, who's this?
[279:50.45]Alright, this is actually his signature.
[279:51.67]Tennis player.
[279:53.45]So it's an athlete.
[279:56.84]This is a, this is a very common signature, but is an athlete.

[280:12.65]Signature of an athlete.
[280:14.19]And, uh, I'll tell you something you should know.
[280:16.93]These are really common.
[280:18.47]This is obviously prerecorded.
[280:25.22]They all are.
[280:26.22]Every single one of them.
[280:27.76]I'll give you five dollars for it.
[280:30.38]Seven.
[280:35.69]Price is already low.
[280:36.69]Can you just give me twelve?
[280:40.47]Yeah, sure.
[280:41.07]That's fine.
[280:41.83]Yeah, that's fine.
[280:42.59]It's twelve bucks.
[280:43.15]Why are you wasting time on stuff that's worth twenty dollars?
[280:50.32]Because of its reputation.
[280:53.62]Hilarious crack and how much is it 200?
[280:55.75]They must be wrong 38 bucks.

[281:42.41]Too much.
[281:43.92]And, uh, oh, this thing too.

[284:06.93]Didn't sell umbrellas.
[284:07.99]No, I'm not selling umbrellas.
[284:09.87]Thank you for taking part in the protest.
[284:11.11]You wanted me to be there today.
[284:12.17]I was.
[284:14.69]She's going to revisit me.
[284:15.65]The lady and her son.
[284:16.97]And I paid some interest.
[284:18.07]And then I gave the umbrellas to the people.
[284:20.39]Charge.
[284:22.48]Charge.
[284:25.74]Oh, pretty good charge.
[284:29.49]If you put the painting back in your bag, a collector will buy it for huge money.
[284:32.29]So I shouldn't have it on the display.
[284:34.67]I don't know what to believe.
[284:42.18]Sell some umbrellas, you coward.
[284:47.17]He's in the car.
[284:52.52]We've never played this game.
[284:53.38]We have no idea.
[284:54.04]Well, neither do I. So we can't all act like we know what's going on.
[284:58.54]I agree we need to fix her.
[284:59.56]You know, one of my friends died from depression.
[285:02.02]She had been fixed.
[285:02.76]She wouldn't have suffered from depression.
[285:04.26]And of course, she could be with us now.
[285:07.28]She's a fixie then.
[285:09.76]Anyway, she's alive.
[285:11.38]What's the better?
[285:15.89]Why don't we just arrest them?
[285:18.52]Because we don't have to.
[285:20.17]They will come to an end all at once this evening.
[285:23.97]What?
[285:31.05]Uh... Um... What does that mean?
[285:43.20]What's wrong with used ones?
[285:45.00]If it's darkseeds, it's not bad.
[285:48.96]I give him my hoverboard.

[286:24.16]I skipped Travis Strikes again, so I don't understand what's going on in this game right now.
[286:28.00]I'm sorry.
[286:28.40]Hi.
[286:37.40]Does Yongji come around here?
[286:38.54]I don't want to be associated with him.
[286:40.90]Can you take a look at this?
[286:44.05]You're collecting umbrellas, right?
[286:45.15]It's not his only job, but you're right.
[286:48.83]Okay.
[286:50.02]By the way, are you in charge of reselling too?
[286:51.84]The prices here look pretty high.
[286:52.88]You know, you're not the first person to say that.
[286:57.29]Uh, I'll take it.
[286:58.09]For $38 exactly.
[286:58.45]No, I'll take it for $30.
[287:14.98]plant is dying.
[287:15.82]I can't water them.
[287:17.72]How much is that painting?
[287:20.32]None of these people want to buy this.
[287:22.96]No, I'm not selling it for 30 bucks.
[287:24.54]I think I have to put it back in my inventory.
[287:33.97]I have to put this shit back in my inventory.
[287:38.85]Get them off display.
[287:40.69]And put the fucking DS up here.
[287:43.83]No, this.
[287:49.07]Alright, it's fine.
[287:52.77]Wow, it has been a while.
[287:56.01]Yeah, we used to meet each other like every day, huh?
[287:58.83]I will never try to be polite to you anymore.
[288:02.07]Did you see... What is this?
[288:03.97]I finished it last night.
[288:07.23]Wako?
[288:08.46]The guy who had paint stains all over his shirt.
[288:11.84]Um... Yeah, I know who that is.
[288:18.45]And you know how much I want him to see this, right?
[288:22.21]If so, I need you to put this on your showcase so that Bako can see it on the way.
[288:25.97]Is this free?
[288:28.66]Yep.
[288:29.12]You don't want to have it?
[288:30.52]Oh, stop.
[288:32.88]Then put it on the showcase right now.
[288:37.12]You know what?
[288:37.42]Fine.
[288:37.64]I'll do it.
[288:38.02]Appraised at 385.
[288:53.75]How much is the movie script?
[288:56.57]60 bucks.
[289:00.37]60 bucks?
[289:01.69]14?
[289:04.45]I was gonna say, if you got an authentic signed movie script by one of the actors or the writers in the movie, that would be probably worth hundreds of dollars.
[289:16.69]Right?
[289:17.23]Hundreds.
[289:19.27]Put it in the showcase.
[289:20.25]Alright, fuck.
[289:33.05]Excuse me, excuse me.
[289:34.57]That painting of the centaur.
[289:36.45]Who's the artist behind that piece?
[289:39.25]Are you going to report it to the AVAC?
[289:41.85]No, I'm not.
[289:42.49]I just find it fascinating.
[289:44.67]It's been a while since I've seen such a vibrant painting.
[289:47.62]It almost sounds like it's saying, I don't care about what AVAC thinks.
[289:51.08]So it deserves my respect.
[289:52.88]Anyhow, whose painting is that?
[289:55.94]The owner's granddaughter.
[289:57.00]She has quite a temper, though.
[290:00.75]Oh, Nary Joe?
[290:01.92]Alright.
[290:02.40]If I only had the money right now, I'd buy it right away.
[290:04.32]How unfortunate.
[290:09.22]Uh, Bob, I want some arm upgrades.
[290:10.50]I'm gonna be a painter too.
[290:16.10]Just like what I expected.
[290:17.06]This place always looks like Januk of Sing Sing, you know?
[290:19.66]Another umbrella.
[290:23.89]Uh, it's an umbrella.
[290:31.10]I get 50 bucks anyways.
[290:32.16]Who cares?
[290:32.52]I'm drunk.
[290:36.94]Be careful.
[290:37.32]Slow down.
[290:38.38]Don't drink too much.
[290:39.10]Drink some water.
[290:40.34]Have a glass of water.
[290:41.96]Slow down a little bit and relax.
[290:42.90]Don't want to go too far.
[290:45.72]Hope you're having fun.
[290:48.08]Oh, shit.
[290:48.42]How much is the Einstein Chalk?
[290:49.60]200 bucks.
[290:50.40]Exactly.
[290:58.57]What the fuck do you know?
[291:00.82]Uh-oh, the music.
[291:15.02]I'd like to buy the tennis ball.
[291:16.02]How much?
[291:17.81]It's 20 bucks.
[291:19.21]Fine, whatever.
[291:20.43]It's gonna be 10.
[291:21.73]Three dollars.
[291:23.53]Oh, I... Uh, whatever.
[291:27.05]That's a waste of money.
[291:28.23]Actually, I'm not gonna buy any more of these.
[291:37.08]They're actually worthless.
[291:38.24]I'm not buying anymore.
[291:42.92]I found this at home.
[291:43.70]How much can I get for it?
[291:45.84]Okay, here we go.
[291:50.48]Here we go.
[291:51.98]It's really actually really good condition.
[291:55.84]Very good condition.
[291:57.96]This is leather.
[291:59.39]That is authentic leather.
[292:01.23]It is.
[292:01.59]You got that right.
[292:04.49]Seem like an honest man 2079 Doesn't really have any it does have significance, but not it's a bag What have we got here no signature?
[292:13.57]It's just a bag It's just a bag Okay It's just a bag um
[292:36.71]I'll give you 280.
[292:41.15]Alright, alright, 300.
[292:43.91]That's the best I can do.
[292:49.33]There was no brand.
[292:50.51]There's no brand on it.
[292:54.51]Brandless.
[292:56.67]Alright, movie script.
[292:57.47]60.
[293:02.63]Why does nobody want to buy this for what it's appraised for?
[293:05.07]It's worth.
[293:09.13]Should I just get rid of this?
[293:13.30]Whatever.
[293:13.72]I mean, no one's going to buy it.
[293:18.68]Reputation declining.
[293:19.96]I'm doing alright.
[293:25.70]Hey, Bob.
[293:26.10]Thank goodness it's Friday.
[293:27.22]Have you found my time cinema?
[293:29.84]I did.
[293:30.16]I did get you your time cinema.
[293:34.45]Here it is.
[293:37.75]How much is it?
[293:39.07]For you, Bob, I'll give it to you for 150.
[293:50.52]So he eventually helped me get all the two items.
[293:52.90]Thank you, thank you so much, Bob.
[293:54.30]And believe me, I'll never forget this.
[293:56.16]I gotta head to the Institute.
[293:57.02]Please wish me luck.
[293:57.62]Is he gonna, like, time travel back in time or something?
[294:00.71]What's he gonna do with that?
[294:09.45]Finally, I get to meet you.
[294:10.67]I've heard some good stories related to you in this store.
[294:13.23]I wanted to give you a present.
[294:15.39]Can I give you a present?
[294:18.27]I picked it up somewhere.
[294:19.35]It looks really old, but there's no space for this painting in my apartment.
[294:23.39]I'll take like $50 million.
[294:27.09]I've got no eye to appreciate it, so I thought I'd be able to give it to you.
[294:29.55]It's been a while since I've felt gratitude.
[294:34.16]Thank you.
[294:34.50]Alright.
[294:36.68]See you later.
[294:37.36]Wait, hold on a minute.
[294:44.69]I mean, this is worth a lot of money.
[294:52.32]My ex gave it to me some time ago.
[294:55.72]Silver glasses.
[294:56.66]Okay.
[294:57.21]Well, how could silver glasses be made out of platinum?
[294:59.19]That's what I don't understand.
[295:04.37]What?
[295:06.09]What?
[295:07.92]They are.
[295:08.54]That's weird.
[295:09.20]Okay, that's strange.
[295:11.92]2065.
[295:13.08]Nothing significant signed by anybody.
[295:14.78]They are.
[295:15.12]Who is this?
[295:19.05]A jeweler in charge of the inspection of the jewels of Queen of Hearts.
[295:22.99]So that's a jeweler.
[295:23.79]Look at that.
[295:28.65]Signed by a jeweler.
[295:29.40]Isn't that interesting?
[295:32.00]Very cool.
[295:35.70]And I think that's, uh, let's make sure we get that right.
[295:38.30]Nothing I can drag over and that's it.
[295:40.66]Cool.
[295:42.88]I'll give you a, I'll give you two, uh, 240.
[295:55.69]We take 240.
[296:02.51]Alright, nice.
[296:03.03]Alright, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[296:04.91]Alright, let's put that immediately up for like 400.
[296:08.53]Look at this shit.
[296:09.35]400 bucks.
[296:09.59]I'm gonna... 410.
[296:19.62]How much is the sweet pocket mummy?
[296:22.36]400.
[296:24.54]Good.
[296:26.02]Oh, yeah.
[296:26.50]Nice.
[296:26.72]Okay, we're back in the green.
[296:31.69]Missing anything?
[296:33.15]Hold the bag, yeah.
[296:35.54]Raised it 400.
[296:35.86]We're gonna put this up here for 500.
[296:40.12]Oh, shit.
[296:41.66]I found you didn't heed my words.
[296:43.82]You helped Professor Choi.
[296:46.06]You let him get a weird machine of his.
[296:48.46]Strictly speaking, you are an avarice criminal, too.
[296:51.11]You helped a dangerous figure.
[296:52.75]So you must pay.
[296:53.25]Pay your fine right now to prove your non-possessive spirit.
[296:57.03]Or else, I'll arrest you for crime.
[296:59.91]The fine is...
[297:03.24]Wait, I changed my mind.
[297:04.58]Don't mind the fine.
[297:05.68]But there's one thing you should follow.
[297:07.18]What?
[297:08.42]From this point on, everything I say to you is confidential.
[297:12.71]Uh... Okay.
[297:17.01]You know about Yujin Oh?
[297:19.53]Yujin Oh, you mean the former leader of the AVAC?
[297:22.56]Mm-hmm.
[297:23.38]If items related to Yujin Oh come in, don't- Don't resell them.
[297:26.10]Just throw them out in Junkyard.
[297:30.42]Dude, there's too many things that I... How much is it?
[297:46.77]It's an artwork, right?
[297:47.76]I'm just asking because you haven't made an art appraisal on this.
[297:52.60]I'll buy it right away if it's a hundred and... But I can't appraise it.
[298:01.25]I can't appraise this.
[298:03.99]Go home.
[298:16.09]Oh, it's you.
[298:17.05]Bob, thank you for being at the protest yesterday.
[298:19.83]Now let's wait and see what will happen.
[298:21.95]I think AVAC will give us a kind of reaction by this evening, because we, including you, all protest with one voice.
[298:30.05]Alright, then.
[298:30.53]Enjoy the rest of your day.
[298:33.73]Some shit's about to go down in about five minutes here.
[298:37.88]I want to buy the crocodile painting.
[298:39.96]Are you just in here?
[298:46.44]Hell yeah.
[298:53.05]Okay, I'm good.
[298:56.43]There's something going down tonight.
[298:59.59]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[299:01.05]Shit's about to go down.
[299:10.00]Are they raining on us?
[299:12.28]Even if I sell all I have, I can't live in Vodopolis, huh?
[299:20.14]Everyone, please go back to your home.
[299:22.38]Oh, God.
[299:23.63]The association is preparing a new policy.
[299:26.73]So stop causing more disturbance and go back to your house.
[299:31.91]A new policy?
[299:32.65]Tell us what it is.
[299:34.80]I'm not in a position to announce it.
[299:37.98]Please go home for now.
[299:43.20]Uh.
[299:44.82]We should press H. Mister, do you like cats?
[299:53.04]Yeah.
[299:54.78]I do.
[299:55.12]Yeah.
[299:58.92]I pressed H.
[300:03.67]I'm so sure AVAC will ask us something preposterous.
[300:09.79]Are you saying you're pro fixed rain?
[300:11.55]Huh.
[300:17.64]I really want to get in there, the bunker of freedom.
[300:19.66]You have anything to say?
[300:24.58]I'd rather tie Wonsu up to the wall.
[300:26.68]Okay.
[300:27.96]Okay.
[300:38.60]That was a Monka, yeah.
[300:45.64]I'm going to make a lot.
[300:46.64]If an art collector comes in, I'm going to make a shitload of money.
[300:49.40]Okay.
[300:56.24]Don't sell anything of Yujin Oh.
[301:01.58]Throw it away.
[301:03.96]In a room so dark that I can barely see, I feel hopeless.
[301:06.64]What do I do now?
[301:10.64]What about I just bribe him?
[301:12.54]No, I cannot waste even Ivana.
[301:14.00]Okay.
[301:22.95]Just bribe him.
[301:29.15]Who, me?
[301:29.49]Who are they talking about?
[301:38.38]You should play the Outer Wilds DLC coming up.
[301:42.81]Are they doing that?
[301:44.01]At the beginning of the week, we announce our new plan.
[301:48.07]Last weekend, the Association stopped the resumption of Fixed Reign.
[301:51.32]However, we are still deeply concerned that it will lead to more crimes.
[301:55.50]Therefore, we'd like to ask for your active cooperation in tracking down avarice criminals from this week.
[302:01.10]From today, all citizens must cooperate to hunt down 90 avarice criminals each week.
[302:06.57]By abiding by this one rule, Ajax City will be free from Fixed Reign forever.
[302:11.66]However, if you fail for two consecutive weeks, fixed reign will begin immediately.
[302:15.47]Today, we will distribute criminal report button.
[302:19.83]Whenever you meet a person who is suspected to be an adverse criminal, just press the button.
[302:24.97]If a citizen gets reported once, they will receive pre-adverse criminal badge.
[302:29.33]If twice, they'll be judged as an adverse criminal who should pay a fine or get arrested.
[302:33.85]You can check the number of criminals searched out during the week in real time through the billboards in Fountain Square.
[302:39.99]Names of excellent reporters and of places where avarice crimes are frequent will also go public.
[302:44.19]We're hoping for the day when Ajak City is reborn as an avarice crime safe city without the help of Fixer.
[302:51.36]Thank you.
[302:56.30]I ain't reporting shit.
[303:00.12]I ain't reporting anything.
[303:01.54]Good luck.
[303:10.69]Look at your face.
[303:11.33]Enjoyed a lazy weekend, huh?
[303:22.96]Arrested.
[303:25.46]Look at that greedy face.
[303:27.72]I'll never... I'll never let me display... What?
[303:31.28]If it's a place with a lot of adverse crimes, you better not go there.
[303:34.04]Okay, they report their neighbor is so ruthless.
[303:35.64]Alright, so that person's been arrested?
[303:47.59]Alright.
[303:49.07]Did you get the morning broadcast?
[303:51.57]Just as it said, let me give you the report button.
[303:55.01]You can press it right from today, and can you see the small display above it?
[304:02.32]On its left is a count of your reports for the day, while the other is a count of your reports for the week.
[304:08.02]Please don't be afraid to press it in the face, since they cannot know if you press it or not, okay?
[304:16.42]Here will be the total number of criminal arrests of the week throughout the city.
[304:19.10]This is getting so complicated.
[304:20.22]Okay.
[304:25.90]Emergency meeting.
[304:27.96]This is a badge for preliminary criminal.
[304:29.76]If you report someone without this badge, they'll soon be listed on the criminal's list and receive this badge.
[304:38.08]However, we will arrest or levy a fine on them in a matter of minutes if they already have this badge.
[304:45.34]Don't forget to check the bulletin board at Fountain Square upstairs.
[304:47.90]It shows the name of the citizen who most actively pressed the button in real time.
[304:55.93]The names will be announced throughout the city and receive special benefits.
[304:58.95]Special benefits sounds good.
[305:00.19]The board also displays the name of high crime spots on which the store can also get nominated.
[305:08.80]Once average criminal customers visit here, often or anyone outside reports your customers a lot and nobody- IRA, whatever.
[305:16.30]Can I just sell fucking toys?
[305:19.02]What if we never press it?
[305:21.84]You'd better not take it as an option for the city.
[305:24.46]Unless you make at least one or two reports every day, then we'll get hit with Fixer.
[305:31.55]Show your responsibility as a citizen of Ajax City, okay?
[305:33.51]So I have to do it.
[305:42.67]Okay.
[305:45.45]Mister, I am from Agic Capital.
[305:47.89]I'd like to tell you some sad news.
[305:51.52]Unfortunately, Agic Capital is terminating its domestic business soon.
[305:55.22]And the fixed rain comes, if it does, there will be no more floaties to loan money to.
[306:01.64]But before that happens, I wanted you to know that you can take out an emergency loan.
[306:09.53]If you need one, mister, you should look onto it.
[306:12.14]The guy from The Simpsons.
[306:13.80]Have a great day, mister.
[306:15.42]I don't need $5,000 right now.
[306:17.31]I manage my money well.
[306:19.13]You can kindly leave.
[306:20.11]I got the registration.
[306:24.63]I did.
[306:24.83]You're the official manager of Darcy's.
[306:29.45]Cool.
[306:30.51]By the way, you got that report button.
[306:33.77]I was going to give you something useful today, but I guess it might be too much for you now that we're being overburdened with that stupid button.
[306:42.42]Life is full of challenges.
[306:45.44]Uh, well yeah, this might be a great chance for you to grow up.
[306:48.95]As you can see, this is a Vertivo hoverboard.
[306:52.17]But, let's say the customer who brought this in doesn't know that.
[306:56.89]You'd probably start thinking.
[306:58.69]Like, if I share the card Vertivo, the customer will surely expect more money, but what if I don't share it?
[307:05.37]That's what I asked four hours ago.
[307:07.15]However, as you know, the card allows you to put a higher price when you resell the hoverboard.
[307:11.79]Exactly when the private slot should come to the front.
[307:19.70]Do you see the new piece of equipment underneath the card slot?
[307:23.30]Try and find the card Vertivo from the manual and put it in the private slot.
[307:28.66]Did it really take him five hours of gameplay to get here?
[307:31.88]To do this?
[307:34.41]Okay, well...
[307:41.83]This is a brand.
[307:46.21]Rotivo.
[307:52.11]Okay.
[307:54.07]You just successfully hid the card using the private slot.
[307:58.51]Hiding information that you don't want to share.
[308:01.23]But if you hide cards that have a pricey information on it, you might get a complaint or a nasty rumor.
[308:10.04]Okay.
[308:11.06]You can hide up to two cards.
[308:12.55]Cards here will be kept secret until you successfully buy the item.
[308:16.57]And they go public as you display the item.
[308:18.77]Okay, I get it.
[308:23.10]Be careful if you use this too often, customers are going to notice.
[308:26.78]By the way, Darcy, is there any problem with your watch screwdriver?
[308:32.01]Oh, about the screwdriver.
[308:33.21]I got it taken away by the stabilizer.
[308:34.76]I was supposed to get him lobster phone, but I failed.
[308:38.98]That doesn't mean you deserve to lose the screwdriver.
[308:41.12]Where did he learn all that torturing skills?
[308:45.18]Truth is that he's been taking my back every time I scavenge from the fixie area.
[308:49.28]Find the lobster phone.
[308:52.72]Okay.
[308:56.56]The authentic one disappeared.
[308:59.75]Ask me to recreate it.
[309:00.45]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[309:01.23]I don't give a shit about any of this.
[309:02.89]Just please let me play the game.
[309:04.85]Bye.
[309:05.03]I don't care about your dumb lobster phone.
[309:10.21]When I pick it up and fucking Elmo's on the other end.
[309:11.88]I don't care.
[309:12.78]Go buy one at Target.
[309:15.24]It's just a black telephone and a lobster.
[309:22.78]Okay.
[309:24.60]More breaking news.
[309:27.50]Stabilizer won first place in last weekend's non-possession spirit competition.
[309:30.40]He was chosen by a citizen's vote.
[309:33.14]One female citizen said he had a sense of restraint, especially he loved his closed lips.
[309:42.04]Get in here.
[309:42.74]Stop.
[309:42.96]Alright, the flawless shoulder bag on the showcase.
[309:47.28]How much is it?
[309:49.56]It'd be 500.
[309:54.36]Skipping lore.
[309:56.27]429?
[309:56.31]That's, uh, I'll take it.
[309:59.03]By the way, you look suspicious.
[310:11.14]Suspicious.
[310:12.58]Bob, dear, now I can finally speak with you.
[310:15.43]Wanshu's been missing his treatments and fading away, so I've been a total mess.
[310:20.45]I think this stopped being a total pain in your neck.
[310:24.29]Oh, no, no, no.
[310:24.93]What has happened around him is just all because of me and my occupation.
[310:30.90]But everything will be fine eventually.
[310:32.80]You know that, right?
[310:34.52]Anyway, guess what I brought for you.
[310:36.88]It's a gem appraiser that can give you a help when you're appraising items with gems.
[310:41.82]I don't know why I said that in a Mario accent.
[310:44.35]Let me show you how to use it.
[310:46.87]Darcy used to separate gems by their surprisingness.
[310:51.92]unsurprising gems.
[310:53.86]All he wanted to know was just their kind.
[310:55.50]Okay.
[310:59.33]It analyzes the kind and the quality of a gem.
[311:04.01]And then you get gem cards.
[311:07.79]At sight, it's a beautiful ruby ring and the price is $1,050.
[311:11.28]I'll click the gem appraiser and move it onto the ring.
[311:15.22]Let's take a picture of it.
[311:22.44]I just do.
[311:24.16]Wait, now there must be a card that only seen by you can you see it.
[311:27.66]It's a garnet, not a ruby, am I right?
[311:31.61]I assume the price dropped big, too.
[311:34.85]Like this, Gem Appraiser is the only way you can check a gem's actual name, so don't forget to use it, especially on accessories.
[311:42.17]Uh, you forgot to mention the card Brand Eraser.
[311:46.01]You must check if a gem is missing or broken when a customer brings branded jewelry.
[311:52.66]That's the case.
[311:53.30]It cannot be classified into general accessories such as necklaces and earrings.
[311:57.88]Its brand effect falls to... There's a lot of info.
[312:01.18]Okay, sure, sure.
[312:01.86]Now I remember that card.
[312:02.74]The brand eraser.
[312:04.20]In a situation like Hugh said, you can bring out the card brand eraser to reduce the price.
[312:08.07]Fuck you, game.
[312:10.57]Oh dear, I have no idea what's happening in my head these days.
[312:14.47]Anyway, it's time for me to get back to work.
[312:16.43]Have a great day, sweetie.
[312:23.11]Okay.
[312:27.57]This is giving me a headache.
[312:28.80]There's too many mechanics.
[312:30.48]I like to buy the silver glasses over there.
[312:32.24]How much are they?
[312:32.90]400.
[312:34.12]Thank you.
[312:43.16]I have a lot of money.
[312:45.20]What's going on here?
[312:46.96]Did you just press the button?
[312:47.94]Sorry if I was too sensitive.
[312:49.17]I did not press the button.
[312:52.24]I'd like to know the value of this fancy item.
[312:57.08]How about $729?
[312:57.91]Wait a minute.
[313:02.91]Okay.
[313:04.75]This is made out of... What is that?
[313:08.84]Silver.
[313:09.24]This is silver.
[313:13.62]Right?
[313:15.42]It's made out of fucking silver.
[313:18.39]But I want $7.29.
[313:19.57]I might be in danger if I get... What?
[313:22.95]I... I don't even know what that was even saying.
[313:27.09]Okay.
[313:30.58]So, let's check.
[313:31.30]Should I do the gem enhancer?
[313:32.68]2067.
[313:34.40]Nothing there.
[313:35.96]No signature.
[313:37.22]Alright, this is... Oh, shit.
[313:49.57]You know, I'll give you the 760 for it.
[313:53.21]I'll give you the 760.
[313:53.69]That's a fair offer, I think.
[313:57.83]That's fair.
[314:01.11]So, I can put this on after, right?
[314:07.55]Yeah.
[314:08.03]Yeah, sure.
[314:14.43]Cool.
[314:17.49]So, how do I put that on?
[314:18.47]Wait, hold on.
[314:26.27]Holy shit.
[314:27.22]It's worth fucking like 3,000.
[314:28.92]Alright.
[314:31.46]Get this out of the way.
[314:33.88]This thing's fucking worth.
[314:35.02]This thing's worth.
[314:36.74]I'll do 3,500.
[314:37.34]Can you please appraise this?
[314:44.71]What the fuck is this?
[314:50.48]A mugshot?
[314:52.94]I think I want to... This is a little suspicious here.
[314:56.38]It's very damaged.
[314:57.24]2064.
[315:02.30]Got a signature on it.
[315:16.59]Is there anybody?
[315:17.19]Is this anything important?
[315:18.17]Who is this?
[315:25.10]I don't think so.
[315:28.76]No.
[315:31.26]On Hang Gong.
[315:32.64]Check the owner of the autograph.
[315:34.02]I don't know.
[315:34.40]I don't know who it is.
[315:40.29]This is just like a mug shot.
[315:41.35]That's suspicious.
[315:51.21]Artwork.
[315:52.45]I don't think this is a mug shot.
[315:53.71]It's not artwork.
[315:57.29]I'll give you $5 for it.
[316:07.07]Just leave.
[316:07.64]I'm not buying a mugshot.
[316:11.56]And by the way, suspicious.
[316:16.50]How much is the painting?
[316:17.80]A hilarious centaur.
[316:21.03]$400.
[316:24.55]Um, yeah.
[316:25.13]Take it.
[316:25.99]It's not mine.
[316:26.47]I don't care.
[316:38.48]Dead up off the ground a while ago.
[316:41.54]Seemingly meaningful paper.
[316:43.04]Okay, looks sentimental.
[316:44.48]Do you know what it is?
[316:45.12]Really shitty condition.
[316:50.47]I hereby declare every chippy will be separated from their potato chips and sales and imports of potato chips will be prohibited.
[316:59.83]This sounds like the plot of like a Mickey Mouse Clubhouse episode.
[317:06.73]What's the big fat cat's name?
[317:14.32]Bluto?
[317:15.16]What's the cat's name?
[317:15.90]Pete.
[317:17.22]Bluto's from Popeye.
[317:20.03]They're the same character, okay?
[317:22.03]They're the exact same character.
[317:28.71]I made it a paper.
[317:29.43]2060.
[317:32.20]Oh, the anti-chippy act.
[317:33.34]Hold on a minute.
[317:35.83]This is significant.
[317:37.17]Wait.
[317:38.73]Wait.
[317:40.55]Wait a minute.
[317:40.91]I don't think I... I don't think I want to tell... I want to hold on to this.
[317:48.00]And... Who signed it?
[317:49.96]Oh, shit.
[317:50.56]Who is this?
[317:58.48]Oh, who's that?
[318:01.02]Sol Han.
[318:01.96]The former president.
[318:03.08]He enjoyed great popularity.
[318:05.98]through legendary speeches.
[318:09.14]This is a product of Sohan.
[318:11.92]He's the old president and everybody loved him.
[318:15.72]Plus 20%.
[318:15.98]This is a politician.
[318:18.73]I'll tell you this is a politician.
[318:24.97]National hero.
[318:36.12]I'm going to say national hero.
[318:37.25]I'm going to hold on to that one.
[318:40.19]And what else can I tell you?
[318:44.85]This is a politician.
[318:46.61]I mean, like, this is not worth anything.
[318:51.88]Price dropped significantly.
[318:53.10]This is a politician.
[318:54.14]They're out of the country.
[318:55.04]They're all for the fixies.
[318:58.05]You don't want this.
[319:01.33]Okay, you know what?
[319:04.25]You seem like a nice person.
[319:09.07]Best I can do is five bucks.
[319:15.46]You know what?
[319:15.94]Yeah.
[319:16.42]I mean, you came all the way here.
[319:18.06]Six is good, I think.
[319:22.84]Thank you.
[319:23.28]Okay.
[319:26.38]I couldn't even report.
[319:30.85]Oh!
[319:30.95]Do you need any help?
[319:35.11]Oh no no no, I was giving it a second thought if I could trust your recommendation.
[319:39.66]The truth is, I'm in Graphological Study Club, and the club holds meetings every Monday.
[319:43.44]So I thought I could rely on you to get something with an autograph for today's meeting.
[319:47.54]But it occurred to me that your recommendation may not be satisfying to me.
[319:52.24]If your recommendation turns out to be reliable, I'll come back.
[320:10.18]Get all this shit out of the window.
[320:11.72]Somebody buy this bracelet.
[320:24.64]I'll sell the hoverboard for $200.
[320:25.60]And then... Okay.
[320:29.63]I want... I need to get rid of these paintings.
[320:38.03]It's not really fancy, but
[320:40.98]That doesn't mean you can't buy it, right?
[320:42.44]This is by, uh... Buzzfly?
[320:52.24]It is... Actually, this is... This is very damaged.
[321:00.19]That's nitpicky?
[321:00.89]No, it's not.
[321:01.43]It's very... It's clearly damaged.
[321:02.89]What is this made out of?
[321:03.65]Carbon fiber.
[321:07.35]You got that right.
[321:11.49]wing it fuzz flies 2076 nothing significant there and it's a signature on it okay what about fuzz fly okay Mr. brand's fuzz fly where's fuzz fly there we go alright oh no this is wrong this is made out of carbon fiber no it is carbon fiber never mind
[321:38.70]Okay.
[321:39.84]A once Midlasean hoverboard brand that lost its reputation after being sold to a corporate republic to avoid taxes.
[321:48.15]Well, sorry to say.
[321:51.89]Sorry about that.
[321:54.87]Oh, Wing It Fuzzfly.
[321:56.07]Wing It Fuzzfly, that's accurate.
[321:58.39]This is actually from Fuzzfly.
[322:00.90]The only thing now that I have to determine is who signed this.
[322:10.67]You did.
[322:10.97]Okay, so this is by an artist.
[322:13.43]It's a fake signature?
[322:14.05]How do you know?
[322:14.55]That's real.
[322:14.91]This is a real signature.
[322:15.59]What are you talking about?
[322:16.37]Oh, shit.
[322:16.67]The top right.
[322:40.91]Report that person.
[322:45.31]Yeah, this is fake, man.
[322:46.41]This is worthless.
[322:49.49]Fake autograph.
[322:58.70]This is worthless.
[322:59.78]I'm not going to sell this.
[323:00.38]Get out of here.
[323:08.61]Does AVAC know you're doing this?
[323:10.13]You chucked this off just because it's not fancy.
[323:12.00]I know that.
[323:14.70]You probably did that yourself.
[323:18.14]You dare bring me a fake autograph?
[323:22.08]Oh, you look even pittier than I. You're locked up in that small desk.
[323:25.43]Here's what I brought.
[323:27.21]Please be gentle with it.
[323:29.83]Strong ring.
[323:30.55]Interesting.
[323:35.95]It's perfect condition.
[323:40.12]What do we got here?
[323:42.38]Damn.
[323:50.69]Randerite?
[323:53.33]Push and cut?
[324:01.26]What's the material here?
[324:05.03]Let me tell you something.
[324:05.75]What you got here?
[324:07.15]This is not a stainless steel ring.
[324:09.33]This is a platinum ring.
[324:12.37]That's a platinum ring, my friend.
[324:14.55]I am the judge.
[324:15.11]Yeah, it's worth a lot more than you think it is.
[324:20.53]Let's see if we got anything else significant on here.
[324:25.49]Fixer 1.0.
[324:26.27]Okay.
[324:27.15]What about... Anybody sign this ring?
[324:28.79]No.
[324:29.01]It's a really nice ring.
[324:30.60]It's a very, very nice ring.
[324:31.80]And you had it wrong.
[324:34.52]It was actually platinum.
[324:36.66]So, I mean, like you're going to get more than you thought.
[324:42.81]What I can give for you here, I'd say somewhere around $1,500, but I could probably do $1,200.
[324:48.53]That's all my money.
[324:54.49]That's a good $1,000.
[324:55.03]Great!
[324:55.17]Great!
[325:05.56]Get that shit right up there immediately for four grand.
[325:16.37]Who are you?
[325:17.79]Just like what I expected, this place always looks like Junuk of Sing Sing, you know?
[325:20.89]I don't know what that means.
[325:25.40]Chessboard by Everbrown.
[325:28.86]It's in... I wouldn't say valueless.
[325:30.88]It's pretty damaged.
[325:31.74]I wouldn't say it's junk or anything.
[325:41.86]This is, it is the correct brand.
[325:46.38]Yeah, Miss Everett Brownwood, you got it right.
[325:48.55]Yeah.
[325:50.49]Accurate.
[325:50.83]2077, alright, yeah.
[325:55.53]But unfortunately for you, they're pretty valueless.
[326:02.30]What?
[326:02.48]What?
[326:04.12]Wait, what happened?
[326:05.81]Wait, what?
[326:07.63]How did it become more money?
[326:09.81]Minus 25%.
[326:10.97]What happened?
[326:17.13]What happened?
[326:20.41]This is an easy way to lose reputation.
[326:22.20]It's junk.
[326:31.16]I'll give you eight bucks for it.
[326:37.21]I think it replaced the brand card with the garbage card.
[326:45.90]Oh.
[326:49.64]Seems you're utilizing the private slot very actively.
[326:51.68]Definitely fearless.
[326:53.76]Thanks.
[326:53.94]Bye, Grandpa.
[327:05.00]Hi, do you remember me?
[327:06.20]I do.
[327:07.88]I'm Eggie.
[327:08.72]We met on the street last week.
[327:11.34]Your mom won't like you being in places like here.
[327:13.08]When I read citizen discourse data, there were... My mom?
[327:18.23]My mom and dad aren't with me now because I ran away.
[327:20.65]Mommy and daddy are now... I'm not going to report a kid.
[327:30.07]Get out of here.
[327:30.49]Go on.
[327:32.73]What happened?
[327:36.37]They don't love me anymore because they were hit by the rain.
[327:39.44]I mean, fix rain.
[327:42.58]Mm-hmm.
[327:43.48]But I couldn't even see the rain.
[327:44.62]I was sick and stayed home for a few days.
[327:47.62]You know that fixer just clears up everything of you, but your body?
[327:50.06]It just erases all things inside of you.
[327:52.92]I saw the fixer erasing my mom and dad's spirits into nothing.
[327:56.58]It was just like me being erased from this world.
[327:59.38]One day, I left home by myself, hoping mom and dad would look for me.
[328:03.94]They didn't.
[328:04.54]Day after day.
[328:05.04]So I just kept walking.
[328:06.80]And I ended up in this city.
[328:09.23]You live on the street?
[328:11.27]No, I live together with a lady.
[328:14.33]She said I should not tell anyone about her.
[328:16.05]I don't know why, but she's nice anyway.
[328:20.03]She always puts on some ugly dark clothes when she goes out.
[328:22.85]But I think she'll look better in bright ones.
[328:24.44]Anyway, I'm hungry.
[328:26.84]I gotta head home now.
[328:27.80]See you around.
[328:28.24]I wonder where she's eating.
[328:35.33]Is it the blonde lady?
[328:36.31]Yeah.
[328:37.36]I like to buy the picked up hoverboard over there.
[328:38.94]How much is it?
[328:39.40]$200?
[328:40.98]Sounds reasonable.
[328:44.44]Do I have to report this?
[328:45.34]Do I have to report everybody that has one of those?
[328:48.84]Am I doing that wrong?
[328:53.89]Can you spare some minutes?
[328:55.51]I brought some bad news for you.
[329:00.43]What is it, Darcy?
[329:01.05]Darcy?
[329:02.54]I think it's time for you to move out.
[329:04.36]What?
[329:05.84]If you don't Nari will try to rip you off with monstrous rent.
[329:09.44]She got so upset after she found out that I've been letting you live in that room for free.
[329:14.85]Perfect timing.
[329:15.95]New roof is finally reopening.
[329:18.49]Oh, is it?
[329:18.97]Then why don't you try it tomorrow morning?
[329:20.79]It won't take long since it's on the B3 level of this building.
[329:24.56]I bet it won't take you a lot more move out since there's cheaper options.
[329:28.16]I'm doing Peter Griffin.
[329:29.38]You have till next Monday morning.
[329:31.48]I mean two weeks from now.
[329:32.96]After that, Nari will come and ask for rent.
[329:34.60]I can't help you from then.
[329:37.42]It's also written on the calendar.
[329:38.50]Good luck then.
[329:39.08]I have to move out by two weeks from now?
[329:44.25]Day is over.
[329:46.21]Hard day's work.
[329:46.83]Run home.
[329:51.95]Ooh.
[329:52.11]This is a $122 handbag.
[329:53.25]What the heck is that?
[329:54.61]Any other scraps around here?
[329:56.47]Arrested for crimes.
[330:13.39]Cool stream.
[330:13.95]Thanks.
[330:16.67]Please remember, Yujin Oh, his soul is always with us.
[330:19.87]Okay, don't sell things from Yujin Oh, right?
[330:22.67]I miss you, daddy.
[330:26.26]Can I help this girl?
[330:26.90]I think there's a bunker.
[330:33.64]I forgot about the bunker.
[330:35.28]Oh, Bob, have you seen Wansu?
[330:36.60]I have not seen Wansu.
[330:37.42]I don't know where he is.
[330:44.16]I got a Taco Bell and needed a crunch wrap.
[330:46.74]Awesome.
[330:49.86]Wait, they're working together.
[330:50.58]Come on, Nari, I told you.
[330:53.26]You need to make it much brighter.
[331:01.96]We're still waiting for the art collector.
[331:07.67]I don't know if the art collector is ever going to show up.
[331:11.84]I'm starting to believe that there is no art collector.
[331:23.01]There's probably no art collector.
[331:27.45]Hey Loafer, now I remember who you look like.
[331:29.65]You look like my Loafer uncle.
[331:30.95]I hated him the most.
[331:39.72]Ah, Rick.
[331:42.31]Art collector.
[331:43.13]Yeah, I don't think this is an art collector.
[331:44.45]I think it was a big, complete lie that you guys did.
[331:47.78]Can you pay the fine?
[331:48.84]I, I, I... Pay the fine or you'll get arrested.
[331:55.02]What the fuck?
[331:59.50]Morty.
[332:05.23]I don't know who that is, but I feel so bad.
[332:09.83]Bob Joe?
[332:10.39]Isn't he the manager?
[332:11.05]Wait, what?
[332:12.59]Better watch out for the pawn shop.
[332:13.91]What are you talking about?
[332:15.83]What happened?
[332:16.45]What did I do?
[332:16.91]What did you do?
[332:23.36]Keep the hard work.
[332:25.50]Seems like you need my cleaning service.
[332:27.38]What do you say?
[332:29.42]It'll cost $90.
[332:29.80]Cleaning service?
[332:31.97]Cleaning service?
[332:37.61]You're the informant of the week.
[332:39.47]You were the... Oh, you are the informant.
[332:42.83]I thought they said that nobody knew that data.
[332:44.71]Uh, sure.
[332:46.99]A clean... cleaning service?
[332:49.41]I don't know what he's gonna clean in... Oh, I thought he talked about inside.
[332:52.26]Alright, whatever.
[332:53.04]It's clean.
[333:02.04]Oh, it's you.
[333:03.34]Bobby, look.
[333:04.02]I brought my little gullion.
[333:07.79]She's very shy and not so friendly at first.
[333:10.25]But... Oh my god.
[333:13.27]How evil.
[333:14.43]She's cute.
[333:18.10]I knew you'd like her.
[333:19.88]Ah!
[333:20.64]Gullion!
[333:24.06]What should I do?
[333:25.68]She said Gullion is her everything.
[333:28.32]Did you see which way Gullion went?
[333:29.70]This is why I chose to be a dink.
[333:38.35]Which, by the way, that's double income, no kids, if you didn't know.
[333:41.96]I'd like to buy the luxurious bracelet over there.
[333:44.04]How much is it?
[333:44.56]$3,500.
[333:47.81]Oh, that's a big sale.
[334:01.10]You're the one who reported me, huh?
[334:03.43]You can't confirm or deny that.
[334:06.81]I saw your name on the billboard.
[334:07.81]It must be you.
[334:10.85]Who are you to report me?
[334:12.21]When did I ever get so greedy?
[334:15.63]I told AVAC that I did nothing wrong, that you reported me wrong.
[334:20.65]So when the AVAC guy comes and asks, tell them the truth that you pressed the button by mistake.
[334:24.73]Got it?
[334:29.19]You're already here.
[334:30.03]You've raised an objection to the adverse criminal report sent from this store, right?
[334:35.43]Yes?
[334:36.01]It was claimed that you, Mr. Joe Bob, made a false report.
[334:39.02]Is that true?
[334:40.40]If you admit it, you'll be fined and it's $200.
[335:01.26]I don't, okay, is there a third option?
[335:03.94]I don't understand the question.
[335:05.80]Because I fucking don't.
[335:08.20]I'm supposed to report random ass people?
[335:10.46]I don't, like, I don't know what it even means.
[335:12.28]What am I reporting them for?
[335:15.46]I don't even know what I'm reporting them for.
[335:20.57]Fuck them.
[335:22.43]No, you did it right.
[335:23.51]I did it right?

[336:33.81]It's not very valuable, but it's nice.
[336:37.69]Triple report.

[336:52.42]Dog shit.
[336:55.96]Made out of plastic.
[337:00.85]2020.
[337:00.93]That was last year.
[337:06.50]Somebody signed it.
[337:07.04]Who signed it?
[337:10.16]This is signed.
[337:10.62]Okay, by who?
[337:13.24]Sanghoon Lee.
[337:15.46]After claiming to have come from the future in a time machine and warning about the future via various media, he disappeared in 2079.
[337:25.61]What kind of celebrity is that?
[337:28.41]Is there like a time travel celebrity?
[337:35.85]I don't know.
[337:40.77]This one?
[337:41.53]An activist?
[337:42.65]Journalist?
[337:46.89]Names that are holding onto... Yeah, probably just a mere celebrity.
[337:50.19]I'll give you that.
[337:50.93]He's a celebrity on here.
[337:54.60]You can get a little bit more.
[337:55.60]Another dollar, I guess.
[337:56.56]I don't think anything else is not worth anything else.
[338:02.49]I mean, whatever.
[338:06.21]Give you 10 bucks for it.
[338:06.97]Let's not waste our time on a few, Vannis.
[338:12.22]I'll take your offer.
[338:12.96]Okay, that's not very greedy.
[338:14.34]Don't need to triple report.
[338:15.46]Because I'm not an expert, I don't know the details.
[338:23.21]Can you give me the details?
[338:24.87]Handwritten score of warm ocean.
[338:30.42]What is this?
[338:32.56]This is pretty much slightly damaged.
[338:37.72]It's pretty cool.
[338:39.64]It's not a bad piece of work here.
[338:41.62]Made out of paper.
[338:42.22]2038.
[338:42.24]Okay.
[338:43.46]Yeah.
[338:45.19]Did we sign this?
[338:49.75]It is signed.
[338:53.17]By whom?
[338:55.21]Up here.
[338:57.78]Uh, Gong Deok, a musician of the founding period.
[339:01.86]He wrote the national anthem, The Bunker of Freedom.
[339:06.91]This is a huge deal.
[339:13.87]Founding period, he wrote the national anthem.
[339:18.47]Uh, this is a great figure in world history.
[339:23.84]Would it be artist?
[339:24.54]Artist?
[339:27.07]Or would it be a huge figure?
[339:31.01]National hero?
[339:38.29]Have you found something?
[339:38.93]No, not really.
[339:44.40]Uh, okay.
[339:45.54]So I'll give you, you know what?
[339:47.26]This is worth a little bit.
[339:50.36]It's not, it's a fake.
[339:54.50]It's a fake.
[339:54.96]What do you mean it's a fake?
[340:00.32]Oh, is it fake?
[340:05.64]I could do this, yeah.
[340:06.93]It's an artist.
[340:10.55]Pretty cool, huh?
[340:14.45]It's missing the dot?
[340:16.53]No, it's not.
[340:16.99]It's there.
[340:18.61]Okay.
[340:19.67]So I'll give you... I'll give you 400 for it.
[340:27.79]Turned out I got scared for nothing.
[340:30.70]It's going to be... No one that can turn to... Whatever.
[340:33.44]Okay, so I'll sell this for 700.
[340:38.79]180p chat.
[340:39.53]Uh-oh.
[340:41.29]Hold on.
[340:43.93]He's talking right now.
[340:45.44]And it's going to skip.
[340:46.30]I know it.
[340:46.70]Hey, when are you going to get me my lobster telephone?
[340:52.47]You'd do that for me.
[340:54.21]You must have been really desperate.
[340:56.34]I already promised my customer I'd get a lobster telephone, so you must prepare the lobster telephone.
[341:00.12]I don't... Okay.
[341:01.56]Throw that screwdriver into the ocean.
[341:02.86]Fine.
[341:04.96]Don't forget, it's Friday.
[341:05.96]No one's coming with a lobster telephone, dude.
[341:15.37]Uh, let's sell this for $180.
[341:18.78]Put the music up here for about $800.
[341:20.38]No, $750.
[341:21.66]Let's be fair.
[341:25.29]It's a weird cup.
[341:26.29]Sell it for $18.
[341:30.19]Alright.
[341:31.73]Are they ever going to come in and buy this shit?
[341:37.49]It's honest to God.
[341:38.63]I don't think anybody comes in.
[341:40.75]You guys are just lying to me this whole time.
[341:46.33]There's no art collector.
[341:48.13]It's been like an hour and a half.
[341:51.11]There's no art collector.
[341:57.42]It needs to be on display.
[342:03.28]Well, okay.
[342:10.29]On display, on display.
[342:15.29]It'll be the next fucking guy if you sell him.
[342:17.09]Alright, whatever.
[342:26.39]It's good to see you're keeping the store as it used to be.
[342:28.64]It's still rugged.
[342:29.30]Oh, I got this thing.
[342:32.72]Everbrown stuff is worthless.
[342:34.84]You should know that.
[342:35.40]I don't even want this.
[342:39.58]Are there gems in there?
[342:45.55]Yeah, it's everbrown, but the everbrown's fucking worthless.
[342:51.29]It's everbrown.
[342:52.15]Yeah, it is.
[342:54.20]Uh, they're absolute garbage, though.
[343:01.44]And I'll lose reputation if I have this in my store, so get it out of here.
[343:08.67]On display.
[343:09.29]On display.
[343:09.79]What?
[343:13.19]Just leave.
[343:13.57]Just leave.
[343:15.60]Okay, I'm gonna do immediate decline if it's Everwood.
[343:24.70]Report him?
[343:26.06]No, I can't report somebody for not knowing.
[343:27.80]I thought that was a fish.
[343:31.66]Okay, it's a vertigo.
[343:34.72]Well, you know that.
[343:36.70]How damaged is it?
[343:38.30]It's not, that's, that's not... It's not that damaged.
[343:44.71]It's not that damaged.
[343:47.49]Okay.
[343:48.09]What is it made out of?
[343:50.79]Authentic?
[343:52.81]I think.
[343:55.46]Right, yeah.
[343:57.54]It's authentic, yeah.
[343:58.88]Alright, what else do you got in here?
[344:00.64]Uh, these products are popular for dolphin leg.
[344:02.92]Wait, what year?
[344:03.60]2061.
[344:04.58]Uh, Royals say that those produced before 2068 are ugly.
[344:10.23]Uh...
[344:16.52]I'll give you this one.
[344:21.00]I'll give you that one.
[344:23.68]Okay, I'll give you that one.
[344:29.15]It's signed by Lee Sang Hoon.
[344:36.77]That's another celebrity signature.
[344:38.85]I will hold on to that.
[344:42.12]That would be a celebrity.
[344:48.08]Never played this game.
[344:49.08]This game can be 15 hours.
[344:50.50]Oh, well, uh, whatever.
[344:51.62]I'm still, I'm going to stop when I'm done having fun.
[344:55.92]I'll give you, um, I'll give you 300, uh, 315.
[344:57.15]I'll give you 300.
[345:16.21]I'd like to buy the strong ring over there.
[345:18.47]Oh, how much is that ring?
[345:19.75]That would be $3,500, please.
[345:25.32]$3,377?
[345:27.88]I'll take it.
[345:28.54]Handshake.
[345:32.14]I'm getting to that bunker.
[345:35.44]I'm getting to that
[345:41.95]I meant to buy something, but instead I gotta ask you a favor.
[345:45.39]I just got into trouble.
[345:46.57]Somebody made a report about me a few minutes ago.
[345:49.51]But I can't afford the fine.
[345:50.73]I have to pay for my daughter's treatment.
[345:53.31]I'm asking for your generosity to give me 1100 bucks!
[346:01.50]I can't promise you a golden ring, but I promise I'll spread good words about you, I swear.
[346:07.96]As you can see, I have nothing to lose.
[346:09.72]That means I won't feel sorry even after making a report on a total stranger.
[346:13.04]Wait, was that a threat?
[346:30.54]Did he just threaten me that he was going to report me?
[346:33.24]I'll report you.
[346:37.18]I feel like we're both holding, like, cell phone cameras at each other.
[346:41.26]Oh, you're recording me?
[346:42.00]I'll record you.
[346:42.98]We're both recording each other now.
[346:54.33]Yeah, it's two Karens.
[346:55.79]Like, videoing each other, screaming at each other.
[346:58.57]The Karen mirror.
[347:03.17]Karen battle.
[347:08.90]You know, it's really, I can't, you know, if you think about that, like, okay, if somebody's being, like, filmed, being, going, like, crazy or something, like a Karen, and then they go, oh, yeah, well, I can record you, too.
[347:16.59]And then they hit the record button.
[347:19.57]So, do you think they watch that back later and, like, bite their finger and go, holy shit, fuck.
[347:25.36]Oh, I look, I look weird here.
[347:32.68]Or do you think they, like, try to post it on Facebook?
[347:35.40]To be like, look what this person said to me!
[347:37.32]I feel like it's kind of a 50-50 coin flip.
[347:43.46]I feel like I would watch a video like that back and be like, holy fuck, this is what I sound like?
[347:48.07]What the hell am I doing?
[347:51.49]What the fuck did I just say that for?
[347:54.19]Holy shit, delete this now.
[347:55.61]In fact, recover my iPhone.
[347:58.77]In fact, recover my iPhone, recycle the iPhone, and go get a new one.
[348:04.11]What a fucking disaster.
[348:08.51]I want that cut out of my life completely.
[348:13.73]Alright, um, what do I do here?
[348:15.88]Was that a threat?
[348:19.18]Was this a threat?
[348:20.22]Did he say I would report you if you don't?
[348:22.70]So should I just say yes and report him?
[348:25.10]It was a threat, okay.
[348:27.44]So we report him.
[348:28.46]He reports me.
[348:29.40]I say, yeah, go spread the word about the store being good.
[348:32.84]Take care of the daughter.
[348:33.52]And then we'll go from there.
[348:37.82]Daughter is, I'm okay with giving $1,000 to the daughter.
[348:40.32]So report daughter.
[348:43.24]You get reported.
[348:43.83]Report me back.
[348:44.39]That's fine.
[348:44.81]Report and cut the crap.
[348:51.59]Report and say no.
[348:53.29]He's scamming you.
[348:55.44]But I don't want to report.
[348:56.78]I'm scared.
[348:57.46]Not a threat.
[348:58.50]Give him the cash.
[348:59.64]You know what?
[349:00.10]We're going to do the right thing.
[349:03.90]We're going to do the right thing.
[349:05.55]I won't forget to spread good word about you.
[349:07.53]Look at that.
[349:10.63]Look at that.
[349:11.71]I can afford it.
[349:14.13]Whoa.
[349:16.19]Were you aware of it too?
[349:18.76]That the ABCA was targeting me?
[349:21.60]I wish you could understand what it's like to live as Yeonji Moe.
[349:25.83]And you might understand living as a huge star is never easy.
[349:31.18]My guess, AVAC hates me not because I'm against Fixer, but because I'm too popular.
[349:36.26]Must be that they want to arrest me to fix me and take me away.
[349:39.44]All the love and popularity.
[349:42.07]But I will never let that happen because my fans' love and attention are what I live for.
[349:46.15]As you know, when Fixerain comes, there will be no one left to love me.
[349:49.19]Which means there will be no more reason for me to be alive.
[349:57.01]I don't know.
[349:57.43]Do you have anything to sell?
[349:58.57]You get what I'm saying?
[350:25.35]If you don't, that's still not your fault.
[350:27.25]Anyway, don't forget to drink some warm milk before bed.
[350:30.53]Since this is the second time we've met, I believe you'll find your own way to fall asleep.
[350:36.52]See you around.
[350:40.42]That guy was drunk.
[350:41.50]That guy was drunk.
[350:43.04]Okay.
[350:44.00]Whoa, cat!
[350:50.34]The masterpiece La John Cena on the showcase.
[350:52.66]How much is it?
[350:54.14]It's $2,000.
[350:54.34]I'm just gonna sell it.
[350:58.48]No!
[350:59.14]You don't- I want it to be $1,000.
[351:00.26]Leave.
[351:11.06]I didn't- I did not say La John Cena.
[351:13.72]I didn't.
[351:15.02]Who's talking now?
[351:16.64]You killed my mother.
[351:17.54]Don't you remember?
[351:18.20]What?
[351:20.39]I begged you for an umbrella, but you never listened.
[351:22.78]You cold-blooded monster.
[351:24.94]We had no choice.
[351:25.70]Umbrella sales are not allowed.
[351:28.84]Shut up.
[351:29.30]You're nothing but cowards.
[351:34.55]Did you hear what he said?
[351:35.61]He just asked if your dad's alive.
[351:37.73]I don't feel good.
[351:40.73]If I sold the umbrella, I would get arrested and I would probably get fucking killed.
[351:44.06]Bob, is there any way you can report me to AVAC?
[351:47.14]What?
[351:48.86]I'm exhausted.
[351:49.54]I can't wait for fixed rain any longer.
[351:52.06]I just want AVAC to arrest me.
[351:55.46]Jane would be really happy to hear that, huh?
[351:58.60]Mom is going to have a way better life without me.
[352:00.92]I've always been a burden for her.
[352:03.97]Sorry for this crap, Bob.
[352:04.99]I'll just leave.
[352:06.49]Well, no.
[352:07.41]It's all good.
[352:09.96]Hey, look who's here.
[352:10.76]Jane's looking for you like crazy.
[352:13.54]Again?
[352:14.62]But I'm not a six-year-old anymore.
[352:16.10]Yeah, but you know why Jane's so worried about you?
[352:19.28]So go home and save your mom, son.
[352:22.32]Alright, see you soon, Bob.
[352:24.48]What about the cat?
[352:25.29]The cat just left.
[352:25.85]Wait, the cat is gone.
[352:29.29]Which means less hair in the air now.
[352:31.01]Oh, I love breathing.
[352:33.85]By the way, why do you care that much about Wonsu, Hanja?
[352:37.13]Is he your secret son or what?
[352:40.15]Come on.
[352:41.15]They say near neighbor is better than a distant cousin.
[352:45.97]Anyway, it seems Wansu wants to rely on you, Bob, just like he did a decade ago.
[352:49.92]What?
[352:50.66]No wonder, because you and your brother, Bokugou, used to protect him.
[352:55.04]Whenever Wansu got bullied by other kids for being a son of jewelers.
[352:58.71]Before you and Bokugou each got away to Bluebird and Haga City of all the sudden, and that changed him.
[353:06.28]Don't get me wrong, I'm not blaming you.
[353:08.06]The kids who bullied Wansu are guilty for all this.
[353:10.58]Not to mention the silly kidnappers who blackmailed Jane after kidnapping- Wow, how- Why do you know all this?
[353:18.97]This is- Don't try to explain.
[353:20.45]Your way of talking is not- I'm just very confused.
[353:23.39]Report him.
[353:25.03]I don't like this info.
[353:26.03]I don't like hearing this.
[353:26.81]He's such a lonely boy, you know?
[353:29.59]Who'd like to give a damn about my loneliness?
[353:37.51]Day's over.
[353:37.91]Hard day's work.
[353:39.31]Time to go home.
[353:45.90]Please go find Wonso before we please.
[353:50.30]Seems like an indoor cat.
[353:53.55]I like this cat.
[353:57.49]Donate for zero.
[353:58.43]Okay.
[353:59.09]We can't take a rest.
[353:59.89]Tomorrow's already Wednesday.
[354:01.77]Wish I could go to bed with ease tomorrow.
[354:04.84]I got a badge, so I've got to be careful.
[354:07.00]Those criminals just look normal.
[354:11.52]Alright, well, I'm good.
[354:13.40]You need to report more people.
[354:14.90]No, I don't.
[354:16.20]Almost there.
[354:16.68]I don't want to report more people.
[354:23.87]Hey, I have something to... What's up?
[354:27.11]Nothing, please go ahead.
[354:28.91]What's going on, dude?
[354:35.81]What's going on?
[354:38.11]Report more people or get the funny rain.
[354:40.11]Let me know if you need anything, dude.
[354:46.34]The cat's in my apartment.
[354:47.52]Oh, no, it's not.
[354:49.94]You have to report people.
[354:52.08]I reported like five people.
[354:54.90]Chat, that was 16 left, not 16 total.
[355:01.26]Who cares about the rain?
[355:02.46]Just use an umbrella.
[355:03.44]But I'm going to get arrested.
[355:10.54]Alright.
[355:17.72]I have to move out too, yeah.
[355:19.21]How much does it cost?
[355:19.91]What did they say?
[355:31.12]It was third level?
[355:39.87]Third level, right?
[355:45.42]No, where is it?
[355:47.40]B3?
[355:48.58]Isn't this B3?
[355:53.56]Would B3 be the bottom?
[355:59.44]I already live on B3, don't I?
[356:00.69]In the other area?
[356:10.41]Oh, it's above this door.
[356:11.43]Okay.
[356:26.34]It ain't easy being cheesy.
[356:28.78]Where are you?
[356:29.56]I saw the cat.
[356:30.82]I know where the cat is.
[356:31.66]I can't tell her though.
[356:35.02]Informant of the week.
[356:37.90]I'm not on there.
[356:38.90]That's good.
[356:42.97]My name's been posted here.
[356:43.85]Can I sleep well at night?
[356:54.46]Okay.
[356:55.46]Whoa, what happened?
[356:57.85]Make it a society where, whatever.
[356:59.83]How do I look?
[357:00.77]There has been my exterior upgrade last night.
[357:03.31]It's a gift.
[357:04.41]You raised all the three reputations by at least one level each yesterday.
[357:07.35]FYI, this is the hue that emulates Darcy look.
[357:11.53]Poke me if you want my former look back.
[357:14.20]I'll catch your signal and get it back.
[357:15.86]And there's more.
[357:16.74]Didn't you see what's over there?
[357:18.36]There's a chime bell above our door.
[357:20.10]The guy who received $1,100 from us came and left it last night.
[357:24.46]He said he paid for his daughter's treatment with the money and wanted to repay for that.
[357:29.13]Ooh, snazzy.
[357:30.95]I don't have to worry about being reported.
[357:35.45]We caught enough criminals, right?
[357:36.57]Let's see.
[357:40.43]I found this at home.
[357:41.19]How much can I get for it?
[357:42.10]I threw it only a few times.
[357:47.50]You're reselling for high prices.
[357:49.16]You must buy them for a high price too, right?
[357:50.96]I was expecting 15 bucks.
[357:59.48]First of all... What is this?
[358:04.03]The gems in here?
[358:05.35]Eat, buy, go, do, speak, see.
[358:11.06]Oh, it's Everbrown.
[358:26.87]Since I'm not an expert, I don't know its details, but if you're an expert, you can find something.
[358:30.20]I've reported all Everbro.
[358:32.90]They come in here, and it's worth like $3, and they come in and try to get fucking like $20 every time.
[358:38.18]Get out of here.
[358:44.55]This is that guy's doll.
[358:45.87]What's it made out of?
[358:49.55]Cotton?
[358:51.19]Actually, he's made it out of cotton, by the way.
[358:56.11]2076.
[358:56.25]Okay.
[358:57.85]And is it signed?
[358:58.61]That looks like a fake signature.
[359:01.61]It is.
[359:02.01]It's not real.
[359:03.59]This is fake.
[359:05.01]So I'm sorry.
[359:07.01]This is a fake toy.
[359:10.16]So I believe, I'm sorry, I'm going to have to report you for this.
[359:12.90]Because this is, you're being reported.
[359:15.30]For what exactly?
[359:16.50]I don't remember.
[359:18.90]But it's because you have brought fake merchandise into here and trying to sell it for a price that's not fair.
[359:27.77]You didn't know.
[359:31.25]Stop reporting.
[359:32.15]The quote is done.
[359:32.95]You know what?
[359:37.05]I'll give you a dollar.
[359:38.15]Oh, shit.
[359:46.25]Oopsie.
[359:51.33]Can you take a good look?
[359:52.92]Whoa.
[359:54.88]I don't really want to let it go, but my dad has been pushing me hard to sell it.
[359:58.20]Let's take a minute here.
[360:01.32]Our watch screwdriver is not ready yet, which means we can't check its movement.
[360:05.96]I assure you, it's not fake, and I didn't replace its movement, so you don't need that screwdriver.
[360:11.32]What?
[360:11.56]Excuse me?
[360:16.31]It's damaged, first of all.
[360:19.51]Second of all...
[360:21.43]You could have just looked the other way.
[360:22.61]I could have looked the other way.
[360:23.81]This thing's made out of fucking clay.
[360:26.81]This thing's made out of clay.
[360:28.29]What are you trying to do here?
[360:29.83]Reported.
[360:33.03]What is this even made out of?
[360:35.59]This is made out of like dirt.
[360:37.47]You brought me a dirt watch.
[360:43.26]You're going to jail.
[360:46.68]That's not leather.
[360:47.42]This is dirt.
[360:50.60]It's, it's, yeah, hold on.
[360:52.40]There's no signature.
[360:54.28]2068.
[360:54.98]What's this thing?
[360:57.44]Lab between SAS and casual catastrophe.
[361:00.26]Let's take a look at this fucking brand.
[361:03.22]I don't see this listed here.
[361:09.24]Yeah, okay, you gave me a, it's dirt.
[361:17.71]Where's this... Casual catastrophe... Oh, wait a minute.
[361:22.66]This is the leather.
[361:23.48]Okay, so is it real?
[361:30.20]Okay, this is a... I thought it was like fucking Minecraft dirt.
[361:35.35]A bag brand widely recognized as cursed.
[361:40.79]Um...
[361:43.04]It's loved by thrill seekers, but it's cursed.
[361:45.90]The biggest fires broke out in 69 and 73.
[361:47.92]Those products in the years are both rare and popular.
[361:52.32]Holy shit, really?
[361:53.87]69 and 73.
[361:56.77]Oh, you missed it by one year.
[361:57.79]Alright, well this thing is cursed.
[362:02.37]Just to let you know, superstitious people are very upset about that.
[362:04.91]I thought you would be an expert.
[362:06.15]I am.
[362:10.29]I didn't intend to sell it anyways, I'll take it back.
[362:12.65]Yeah, well, get reported.
[362:15.05]You got IP bans from my store, you're not allowed back in.
[362:24.23]800 bucks, you got it.
[362:25.22]Alright.
[362:34.02]News!
[362:35.46]A recently arrested avarice criminal made a shocking statement before getting fixed.
[362:39.34]The criminal confessed he was the arsonist responsible for the brutal fire in 2035.
[362:45.21]He stated, Saying John Ann, the national hero, was nothing but one of the victims.
[362:55.86]New hero is born.
[362:57.40]John Ann already became famous, so what's he got to lose?
[363:01.66]Next up, the recycling committee has announced that this week's target of material is aluminum alloy.
[363:06.38]Citizens who are actively participating in aluminum alloy collection will be given footrests made of recycled material.
[363:12.38]You know we can't partake in that.
[363:13.63]We're shopkeepers.
[363:15.05]Somehow I feel bad they changed the gift from pew to footrest.
[363:18.69]Am I equivalent to a footrest?
[363:21.67]This reporter, say woo.
[363:23.95]Anyway, aluminum alloy, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's expensive.
[363:26.59]Yeah, yeah, yeah, sell it.
[363:27.96]Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got aluminum.
[363:33.06]How much is the picked up lunchbox bag?
[363:34.84]180.
[363:43.75]Fine.
[363:45.27]How do you know I got it from the trash?
[363:55.02]Bob, you haven't heard the news, have you?
[363:56.84]This is huge.
[363:59.81]Hanja was attacked last night.
[364:02.05]Guy came in and asked Hanja if she's the father of the owner of the second- AHH!
[364:05.73]And suddenly attacked him.
[364:07.59]I guess that's the guy who came to us to buy an umbrella.
[364:09.93]Maybe he thought Hanja was your dad.
[364:11.68]What?
[364:14.68]Anyway, Hanja is not seriously injured, but he won't open his store for a week to recover from trauma.
[364:21.38]Is that the repair guy?
[364:22.20]I'm happy Darcy's safe.
[364:25.06]You are too, right?
[364:25.86]Come on, you could nod or something.
[364:33.86]Oh shit, there's a lobster.
[364:34.78]Do you want it?
[364:36.62]Yeah.
[364:36.84]I'm just giving it away.
[364:39.49]Yes, I'll take it.
[364:40.77]Now we just need a phone.
[364:48.51]I need a phone.
[364:51.25]I have a phone lying around in my house.
[364:52.75]I do.
[364:55.63]I'll bring it tomorrow.

[364:57.31]Alright, cool.
[364:57.89]Yeah, bring it.

[365:27.32]How much is it?
[365:27.80]Thousand bucks.
[365:32.82]Wait.
[365:35.12]Oh, there it goes.

[370:01.90]There it is.
[370:03.22]This is the FF Fabric.
[370:06.57]You got that right.
[370:08.15]Good.
[370:09.33]This is also...
[370:14.02]Royals love these eco-friendly objects.
[370:16.38]I'll hold on to that one.
[370:20.26]Uh, what else we got?
[370:21.58]What's the year?
[370:22.85]2080.
[370:22.89]Eh.
[370:23.65]And we get a signature on it.
[370:27.61]Okay, well, who's on it?
[370:28.95]You?
[370:29.37]Oh, there you go.
[370:30.17]Who's this?
[370:31.25]A painter.
[370:32.47]In protest against the Fix Room Project in 2079, she donated umbrellas with her signature on them.
[370:37.96]In the Fixie.
[370:39.66]Okay, so this is an artist.
[370:42.36]That's correct.
[370:52.36]She's dead?
[370:52.82]I don't think she's dead.
[370:58.78]Just because you're Fixie doesn't mean you're dead.
[371:00.10]Fixie doesn't mean dead.
[371:06.67]Yeah, how do you know Fixie means dead?
[371:09.47]Is it dead?
[371:10.05]It's only for art.
[371:15.77]Fixie counts as dead.
[371:17.10]Fixie equals dead.
[371:18.02]I don't know if I believe that, but you know what?
[371:21.10]We'll do this.
[371:23.68]Have you paid attention?
[371:24.42]Yeah, but a Fixie makes you like a zombie person.
[371:26.22]It doesn't kill you.
[371:31.04]Are you considered dead?
[371:40.92]Well, let's see if you guys are right.
[371:42.82]Please don't say if you're not sure.
[371:46.34]Shut up.
[371:48.97]Okay.
[371:49.35]Dead?
[371:49.79]Dead?
[371:52.73]Dead artist?
[371:53.47]If you guys are wrong, I'm gonna be upset.
[371:57.21]Dead artist.
[371:59.79]Is that a lie?
[372:00.37]I think I just made this up.
[372:02.94]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[372:04.16]Whatever.
[372:04.50]It's not a piece of artwork.
[372:11.28]Yeah, you guys are wrong.
[372:14.56]You're disappointing.
[372:15.32]I never thought... How could you hide cards to make a deal?
[372:18.31]You've been doing it more than once or twice?
[372:21.98]That made you a huge profit, right?
[372:23.64]I can't believe you're not yet reported.
[372:29.03]You're meaning to report me?
[372:31.25]You want me to do it?
[372:33.57]I would never report you.
[372:34.55]I may not report you, but for now I may say some bad things about you.
[372:44.78]How much is the seemingly meaningful paper?
[372:56.20]Oh, shut up.
[372:58.86]I have verified it three times.
[373:11.09]Hi, I'm trying to get a gift from my cousin.
[373:13.23]Do you have anything to recommend?
[373:14.35]What about some filters?
[373:18.22]Well, it's a gift anyway, so I want some branded thing.
[373:21.42]But at the same time, I want it to be special.
[373:23.76]You know?
[373:24.58]There's some products that the brands genuinely don't make.
[373:28.95]Products that the brands genuinely don't make.
[373:32.51]Do you have anything?
[373:33.15]Um... I have the Mona Lisa.
[373:39.83]You want a hoverboard?
[373:44.73]Genuinely... Generally...
[373:49.60]Look.
[373:52.60]I'm reading a book for six and a half hours.
[373:55.32]I'm going to say a word wrong sometimes.
[373:59.08]Is this like a branded thing?
[374:01.52]I don't think I have anything.
[374:06.99]Do you want this?
[374:09.65]It's branded but too ordinary.
[374:10.95]Is this branded?
[374:15.01]Are any of these things branded?
[374:19.96]No, I don't have anything.
[374:21.84]Sorry.
[374:28.75]Absolutely destroyed on fixer water.
[374:33.01]What the fuck?
[374:35.62]I don't have special secret branded stuff that you want.
[374:38.82]I don't know what you want.
[374:46.44]There we go.
[374:47.10]It's a big cell.
[374:57.18]I also gotta think about when the stream's gonna end tonight.
[375:01.34]Because I'm starting to get a little winded.
[375:04.94]Let her see the secret menu.
[375:11.66]I want to see the secret menu.
[375:12.96]Yeah, we're gonna have the secret menu.
[375:15.42]Sure, I'll show you the secret menu.
[375:16.63]What we do is we put this fucking orange goo all over everything and say it's a secret.
[375:30.32]Nothing.
[375:35.19]Do you like Thousand Island dressing?
[375:37.09]Because it's on everything as a secret.
[375:38.87]He said oof.
[375:56.62]Where are the animal-style hoverboards?
[375:58.96]Right.
[375:59.54]You get it.
[376:01.04]You get it.
[376:07.93]Ooh, what was it?
[376:11.05]Uh... I thought- I was like, what happened with the cat?
[376:16.37]I'm sensitive, okay.
[376:23.98]I kinda wanna just junk this.
[376:25.02]I don't want this in my inventory.
[376:38.12]Alright, so I wonder if I... Do I need to see the end?
[376:42.97]I kind of feel like we need to see at the end how this game ends, right?
[376:46.57]How much longer do you think this is?
[376:51.71]Do we have more than like an hour or so?
[376:53.65]I don't know.
[376:58.04]Oh shit, B3.
[376:59.16]Right.
[377:06.26]Is there a long time left?
[377:15.30]Probably.
[377:15.68]I don't know.
[377:16.08]It's hard to tell.
[377:20.14]Alright.
[377:20.36]Where B2?
[377:21.48]So B3.
[377:22.12]About two hours, maybe.
[377:28.89]It says about eight hours on how long to be.
[377:35.83]Three houses left.
[377:36.59]Can I not buy this?
[377:40.89]B3, right?
[377:42.57]One room.
[377:43.09]New room.
[377:43.47]It's not open.
[377:48.17]There are 30 days in the game and you're on day 12.
[377:50.47]Oh.
[377:51.01]Like halfway.
[377:53.09]You have to go in the morning.
[377:57.87]Oh.
[378:02.07]There's apparently 30 in-game days.
[378:03.81]Ah.
[378:04.93]Hmm.
[378:13.21]Hmm.
[378:13.81]Hmm.
[378:17.84]What do I want to do about this?
[378:19.33]Um... Okay.
[378:23.31]I got a plan.
[378:24.95]I got a plan.
[378:26.51]Here's the plan.
[378:30.51]The plan is, so... The stream's next week.
[378:35.79]Next weekend, because remember, I'm a weekend Andy.
[378:39.23]I was going to do Deltarune, Sims 3 mod, Apocalypse, and this.
[378:46.14]Let's do this.
[378:48.89]So we'll probably do... Okay.
[378:53.51]So now that Deltarune has been out for a day, how long is Deltarune chapter two?
[379:07.88]Is it possible to do both of these?
[379:11.58]About four?
[379:13.20]It's like four to six, four to eight, depending.
[379:15.64]Hmm.
[379:16.12]Okay.
[379:17.29]Interesting.
[379:19.90]Like three to four, four to eight, three to five.
[379:24.02]Okay.
[379:25.84]I think we can do them both.
[379:32.05]It's like, yeah, I usually go on the longer side.
[379:33.99]We need to see the end, right?
[379:41.50]But I can't stream tomorrow.
[379:47.46]I want to see the end.
[379:48.04]Alright, if we have to do... If we have to do three days next week, I'll do that.
[379:56.89]But I don't think we're going to have to.
[380:06.20]Current speedrun is... It can take one hour or twelve, depending on how much you dick around.
[380:13.80]Why don't you stream on the weekdays?
[380:16.67]I'll explain this for a lot of the new people here.
[380:19.51]So I used to do like four days a week.
[380:22.47]I streamed like, oh, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and like Sunday, right?
[380:26.94]I do like three or four days a week.
[380:29.42]But I ran into an annoying medical problem that made it so it was hard to sit down or stand or even be in the same place for more than three, four, five, six hours at a time.
[380:37.12]And it was actually causing me a lot of problems.
[380:41.10]I dialed back my streams because it was physically painful to just like kind of sit here or stand.
[380:48.00]I tried to kind of... It's difficult.
[380:51.11]So, I pulled the streams back and since doing that, I've actually felt a little better.
[380:57.03]I'm able to kind of move around.
[380:58.13]I'm able to do some more things and it gives me more time to work on the big projects that I really want to work on.
[381:03.41]So it's kind of a win-win in a way.
[381:06.43]Streaming less means I feel a bit better and way more interesting kind of projects can be worked on too at the same time.
[381:12.69]Gives me more time.
[381:14.61]But if I'm able to, and that's why a weekend Andy makes the most sense, because streaming like Saturday.
[381:22.85]Alright, you're going to see me on Saturday and I'll see you next Saturday.
[381:25.27]Or like, hey, I'll see you Saturday and Sunday, right?
[381:27.34]That's easy.
[381:28.64]So doing weekday streams is always kind of like, well, which, what day do I pick?
[381:33.52]I guess I'll just do it on Tuesday or I guess I'll do it on Friday right having those set in stone it's gonna be like Friday Saturday or Sunday makes it a little easier to kind of plan what I want to do but I'm not against streaming more but I don't want to do what I was doing before um so it's going to be very rare to see more than two streams a week on this channel
[381:56.62]Sometimes it might be one.
[381:58.44]I don't want to fuck around with this because I've been feeling a little bit better.
[382:01.54]And one of the big contributors has been, I'm not sitting in this chair for like eight hours, four or five days a week.
[382:07.84]Because my streams used to be way longer too.
[382:10.21]I used to sit here at least, it was like my stream average was like seven and a half to eight and a half hours.
[382:16.67]So I really want to keep myself honest here and do that.
[382:21.11]So it kind of explains why.
[382:25.01]But look, if I feel like I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it.
[382:27.28]It's never a guarantee, but we'll see.
[382:29.10]So I think we can do this next weekend.
[382:37.10]Simpsons hit and run.
[382:40.66]Imagine you're a streamer and you develop anti-streamer disease.
[382:43.36]I mean, sometimes it feels like that, I'll be honest.
[382:51.31]Anti-streamer disease.
[382:56.34]Uh, yeah, so, alright.
[382:57.74]I'll see you guys next weekend.
[382:58.94]We'll call it here.
[382:59.52]I think it's a good place to do it.
[383:02.29]Thanks for watching, as always.
[383:03.09]Uh, I'm gonna go get some food.
[383:05.01]Because I don't want to go too much longer.
[383:08.51]If there really is another, like, four to five hours left in this game, I kind of want to see the end.
[383:13.88]I feel like we're invested at this point.
[383:16.14]Um, again, my only complaint to this game is I wish I could not have it go through the text before I press the button.
[383:24.30]That's okay.
[383:24.94]That's one of the only complaints.
[383:29.16]But I'll see you on... Let's go with Friday.
[383:33.82]Friday, we're going to do Sims Mod Hell.
[383:36.88]Saturday, we're going to do Deltarune and possibly this.
[383:40.20]If Deltarune takes a long time, then maybe you'll see a stream on Monday.
[383:44.61]We'll see.
[383:46.63]I will see you next week.
[383:47.39]Oh, Sunday, sorry.
[383:49.03]I'll see you next weekend.
[383:51.31]Let's see how many people subbed.
[383:54.46]There's a lot.
[384:04.12]Have a great night.
[384:08.53]See you then, psycho.
[384:11.91]Yeah, Friday at 2 p.m.
[384:18.65]And after we do The Sims stuff, I'm trying to think of some... There's a lot of other things we can do.
[384:25.62]I have a list of games to play.
[384:28.74]After next weekend, there's probably going to be a couple of pre-stream polls.
[384:35.61]So, those will come back.
[384:36.97]Because I have a lot of options and I'm not sure which ones to do.
[384:39.67]I can do any one of them, to be honest.
[384:45.80]And that's right.
[384:46.44]It's my birthday week coming up this week.
[384:49.58]So, it'll be 36.
[384:53.36]Pretty old.
[384:54.54]Getting up there.
[384:57.42]Not 40 yet, though.
[384:58.88]That's the big one.
[384:59.44]36. 36.
[385:04.62]That's old.
[385:06.70]That's not too old, but it's old enough.
[385:16.04]Happy Hobbit Day.
[385:19.28]Are you gonna be a 40-year-old streamer?
[385:22.26]I don't know.
[385:23.86]I have no idea.
[385:31.33]Retire at 39.
[385:32.01]Retire at 39, 364 days.
[385:36.91]You got to make it to 37.
[385:45.22]I have no idea.
[385:51.22]It's the rest of the time that I spend on the internet here and do content creation in quotes like influencer e-clown.
[386:00.57]it's when I'm not having fun anymore when I think I've had my fill and I think it's over I mean you'll know I this is really important though I don't want to just turn this stream on because I feel like I have to well like I'm forcing myself to I want it to be fun I don't want you guys to think that I'm just like turning it on just because like he fucking has to um
[386:25.56]Because that's the number one thing that I care about on this stream.
[386:27.92]Is it a fun environment?
[386:29.90]Am I having a good time?
[386:30.86]Am I actually enjoying myself?
[386:31.94]Or do you think it's fun?
[386:32.90]I don't want to be like an old, crabby, washed-up asshole that should have probably stopped but just didn't.
[386:41.16]You know what I mean?
[386:41.78]I don't want that to happen.
[386:47.03]So I don't have a set date for that.
[386:53.37]I don't have a time frame for that.
[387:01.51]Dream till you're 80.
[387:05.33]He's already washed up.
[387:06.95]Uh-oh.
[387:07.64]It's too late.
[387:12.04]I'll see you on Friday.
[387:13.08]Have a good week, everybody.
[387:13.88]We're going to do The Sims 3 first.
[387:18.32]I really want to get that out of the way.
[387:19.22]It's been ready for like three weeks.
[387:20.40]I just didn't want to be a Sims Andy.
[387:24.79]And we'll see you soon.
[387:25.53]Take care of yourselves.
[387:27.57]Good night.
[387:28.07]Goodbye.
[387:29.65]Take care.
[387:55.38]you
[388:37.36]I had to come back for a second.
[388:38.48]This is an emergency schedule change.
[388:40.19]I just realized I have an appointment on Friday.
[388:43.67]Emergency schedule change.
[388:44.77]It's going to be Saturday, Sunday, and possibly Monday.
[388:46.91]Emergency schedule changing.
[388:48.11]Sorry about that.
[388:51.94]Alright.
[388:52.54]See you Saturday.
[388:53.28]See you Saturday.
[388:53.76]Goodbye.
[388:54.40]Take care.
[388:55.14]Good night.
[388:56.70]Emergency meeting.
[389:05.12]you
