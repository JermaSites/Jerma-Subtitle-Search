[00:51.87]How are you guys?
[00:52.85]Mary, no, I can't say that, no.
[00:54.77]I can't say that.
[00:56.66]I could have said that a day or two ago.
[00:58.54]I think I did say it a day or two.
[01:03.66]Hope you had a good holiday, guys.
[01:04.98]Welcome to the stream.
[01:07.99]You know me.
[01:09.99]Call me Jeremy if you want.
[01:11.49]Let's start calling me Jeremy.
[01:14.03]I think I'm better that way, you know?
[01:15.69]What do you think's cooler, Jeremy or Jerma?
[01:17.97]Who's cooler?
[01:18.55]I don't know.
[01:22.76]This Jerma's like fucking crazy!
[01:25.52]Jeremy's a little low-key, you know?
[01:27.86]Low-key kind of guy.
[01:34.61]Gonna play Fistful of Frags tonight.
[01:36.97]Just gonna wind down.
[01:37.73]I am, like, so beat from the last three days, I'll tell you.
[01:44.49]Let's turn this down a little.
[01:48.41]Jerry?
[01:49.15]Yeah, Jerry's the weird one.
[01:53.25]Jerry's the weird one.
[01:59.83]Why is my Twitch alert not working?
[02:05.95]It should be working.
[02:06.83]It's not.
[02:09.09]Well, I can't see any of these people that are subscribing.
[02:13.07]That's unfortunate.
[02:14.45]Why is that?
[02:20.05]Hold on a second.
[02:24.42]Greg?
[02:25.88]Thanks a lot, Mulditrip.
[02:29.46]Is Twitch Alerts having problems?
[02:32.34]Maybe it is.
[02:37.15]Alright, let me see why that's happening, oddly enough.
[02:55.61]Give me one second.
[03:12.21]What happens when I just turn that off and change over to here?
[03:15.85]Does it work now?
[03:16.53]I wonder why I can't see anything.
[03:22.26]Why am I stuck here?
[03:27.22]That's weird.
[03:27.74]Let me turn this down just a hair.
[03:33.61]Just a hair.
[03:35.33]That's better.
[03:40.69]Twitch, why are you doing this, man?
[03:45.08]Well, sorry, I cannot see anything.
[03:47.18]I have to, like, physically read them.
[03:48.30]They're not going to pop up on screen, I guess, tonight for some reason.
[03:52.58]But welcome.
[03:52.96]We're going to play Fistful of Frags.
[03:53.78]Hope you had a good holiday.
[03:55.70]And what better way to start than doing a fucking face cam?
[03:58.15]What do you know, huh?
[03:58.63]Didn't think you were going to say this, did you?
[04:00.57]Didn't think you were going to say this.
[04:02.29]We're going to do, every year, we're going to do a Merry Christmas face cam.
[04:09.05]Yeah.
[04:10.07]Because it's like two days after Christmas.
[04:11.51]I guess I could do it, right?
[04:13.87]You're only gonna get this once you... It's okay!
[04:16.11]Now I can see.
[04:16.71]Now I can see.
[04:17.23]The TV Rhino just subscribed.
[04:20.19]Hi, TV Rhino.
[04:22.51]Pre-recorded.
[04:23.11]This is not pre-recorded.
[04:24.99]I got a haircut today.
[04:27.25]Look like shit.
[04:28.81]Hey, but that's every day, right?
[04:32.37]I'm not sweaty.
[04:34.25]What are you talking about?
[04:35.07]I'm not sweaty at all.
[04:37.13]Wait, what?
[04:38.27]So how come when I turn on my face cam, I can see this shit up here?
[04:42.09]That doesn't make any sense.
[04:47.12]Hey, well, now you saw it.
[04:48.42]Thanks for watching.
[04:49.50]We're going to turn it off now.
[04:51.08]Because I don't do face cam.
[04:52.94]Because fuck face cam.
[04:55.35]It's stupid.
[04:59.25]It's surprising.
[05:00.03]Oh, shit.
[05:00.99]I'm so sorry.
[05:01.65]I just broke everybody's eardrums.
[05:03.07]I apologize.
[05:04.61]Somebody just fucking gave $1,000.
[05:09.11]I'm so bad at this.
[05:09.89]When I have a camera on my face, I'm not good at this.
[05:14.07]Watch this.
[05:14.67]I'll give you an example.
[05:15.39]Ready?
[05:15.79]Yeah.
[05:18.04]Alright, so there's no face cam.
[05:20.16]Like, look at how fucking, like, how much funnier I am.
[05:22.47]You know what I mean?
[05:25.29]I'm so much funnier without the face cam on.
[05:27.43]Like, turn the face cam on.
[05:29.29]Not funny anymore.
[05:31.07]I have to, like, pretend like I look good.
[05:34.82]That was funny.
[05:36.48]Funny?
[05:37.50]Not funny at all.
[05:38.38]Absolutely not funny at all.
[05:39.82]Hilarious.
[05:41.02]Not funny.
[05:42.91]Like, jokes for fucking days.
[05:45.47]Can't even make a sentence without skirting it out.
[05:50.07]I should probably thank these people.
[05:51.77]I'm assuming I should probably do that.
[05:57.25]Alright, we're gonna play the game.
[05:58.91]Welcome, hi.
[05:59.52]We're gonna play the game now.
[06:06.52]Let's go!
[06:08.92]Facecam makes it not funny.
[06:10.16]I know, that's what I'm saying.
[06:11.06]I agree.
[06:11.62]I agree.
[06:13.58]But doing that seems to have broke everything.
[06:15.48]Hold on.
[06:19.60]What great teeth you have.
[06:23.17]Why is it... Can you stop fucking up, please?
[06:27.17]I go away for like three days and I forget how to fucking live stream?
[06:29.67]Alright, we're gonna go with Schofield left-handed like we always do.
[06:36.20]Can I not play?
[06:36.82]Come on, let me play.
[06:40.75]Yeah, I gotta catch up on these people that are giving money.
[06:47.77]New haircut.
[06:48.77]No, new haircut.
[06:49.99]I don't like when I get a new haircut.
[06:51.89]I think I always look like shit.
[06:55.33]I get like chicken hair.
[07:05.15]I thought I was gonna start off a little rusty.
[07:06.90]I don't think so.
[07:10.13]How do I get such white teeth?
[07:12.33]Crest, baby.
[07:14.51]You gotta get the aqua fresh, the shower bubbles one.
[07:17.23]Fuck.
[07:22.50]Yeah, my whole Twitch alert setup is not working.
[07:26.78]I'll try to fix it after a couple of rounds here.
[07:32.56]What a cutie.
[07:33.20]Thank you, Sam.
[07:34.70]Hey, you're a cutie too, dude.
[07:42.34]Right off the bat, I'm gonna get like four or five kills in a row.
[07:48.04]Where the fuck was that guy?
[07:51.70]Where did I just get shot from?
[07:52.66]What?
[07:57.08]You gotta get the aqua fresh, the orange one.
[07:59.58]The one with like the shower bubbles.
[08:02.60]It literally is like advertised as a shower for your mouth.
[08:07.06]Wait, I'm not supposed to have any sponsors.
[08:13.17]Shit.
[08:14.61]Come on.
[08:14.97]I gotta get better at this game.
[08:16.17]My name's still Fred.
[08:27.79]Don't want to punch right in his face.
[08:34.26]Here we go.
[08:34.62]One, two, three.
[08:39.04]I punched him like three.
[08:40.18]What?
[08:40.40]Sellout.
[08:44.30]I gotta get a string of 10 in a row, otherwise I am not good.
[08:51.26]Why haven't I smoked a joint on stream?
[08:55.18]This guy's like, yo, smoke a joint on stream!
[09:00.82]What?
[09:02.84]I don't even smoke weed, guys.
[09:06.34]Well, I probably should.
[09:08.88]See that one?
[09:10.52]That was not bad.
[09:19.04]Did I get any credit for that?
[09:19.98]I hope so.
[09:20.36]Apparently, like, marijuana is actually good for, like, your digestive problems.
[09:31.36]Like, people that have, like, colitis and Crohn's and stuff.
[09:33.40]So, I hear.
[09:35.04]So, I hear.
[09:41.45]It's gonna be legal in Massachusetts anyways.
[09:44.47]Passed.
[09:46.63]Recreational marijuana actually passed in Massachusetts, so it ain't gonna be long now.
[09:51.87]I got three in a row going, this ain't bad.
[10:04.96]Wow, and that guy, I need whiskey right now.
[10:08.45]Right now.
[10:10.25]In the safe?
[10:10.95]No.
[10:11.83]Oh boy, that guy's got a golden gun.
[10:14.35]Gotta play this one easy.
[10:15.39]Give me that.
[10:15.65]What is it?
[10:16.07]What is it?
[10:16.41]What is it?
[10:16.91]What is it?
[10:17.37]What is it?
[10:18.85]Okay.
[10:19.13]Shotgun.
[10:19.39]I'm gonna wrap this way.
[10:21.71]He's gonna go this way.
[10:22.31]I'm gonna get him.
[10:25.45]Shh.
[10:25.57]Give me whiskey.
[10:26.35]Quick.
[10:28.42]Oh, I got potential to string a lot today.
[10:32.22]Hey.
[10:33.68]Scary guy.
[10:35.54]Popped out of nowhere.
[10:36.34]This is dangerous.
[10:41.50]I shouldn't be out here.
[10:48.93]Not going that way.
[10:49.59]Screw that.
[10:49.93]There's like three of them.
[10:52.92]It'd be awesome if I just killed that guy.
[10:59.54]Let me get to at least 10.
[11:02.60]I'll be happy with that.
[11:07.82]I'm not jumping.
[11:09.06]Don't even ask.
[11:12.42]Don't even ask.
[11:19.25]That is a mistake for me to go over there.
[11:20.95]Hopefully nobody has dynamite.
[11:33.70]Whiskey?
[11:34.24]Anywhere?
[11:36.56]Not in here?
[11:42.10]Anywhere?
[11:43.54]Why are we so trapped in here?
[11:45.84]How was my Christmas?
[11:46.42]It was fantastic.
[11:49.61]I had an absolutely wonderful two or three days.
[11:56.68]I saw my family.
[11:57.98]I saw somebody else's family.
[12:01.80]I'll give you a pro tip, guys.
[12:03.82]Hold on!
[12:04.90]You know... Fuck.
[12:10.16]Can I like... Let me see if I can... I can actually see these now, thankfully.
[12:17.18]Alright, now I can see subs.
[12:18.52]Thank you.
[12:19.12]I'm sorry I missed the people that subbed and gave bits earlier, but for some reason this was all screwed up.
[12:24.23]But just recently, thank you to Kinger2005 for 10 months.
[12:27.69]10 months in a row.
[12:29.05]Thanks, dude.
[12:30.25]Jared is the worst.
[12:32.05]ADAPTSC, thanks for the subs, guys.
[12:34.27]TheWombatFromHell, thanks for two months.
[12:36.50]Doesn't make any sense.
[12:37.18]I can't believe what happened.
[12:38.28]What?
[12:43.60]A Tinder family.
[12:44.82]No.
[12:45.42]I don't fucking use Tinder anymore.
[12:47.72]You understand?
[12:48.20]I don't do it.
[12:51.02]It's not worth it.
[12:51.70]It sucks.
[12:55.78]I spent Christmas with two different families.
[13:01.14]But thanks for the subs, guys.
[13:03.03]Rudy Badger and Porolis Lemon.
[13:04.97]Poris Lemon.
[13:05.63]Porolis?
[13:06.17]Where did I get that from?
[13:06.91]What a fucking idiot.
[13:10.55]Anymore.
[13:11.11]No, alright.
[13:11.73]Listen, listen, listen.
[13:12.85]I can't... Look, you know, remember when I told you I can't fucking talk...
[13:16.38]and play games at the same time.
[13:19.13]I'm just so stupid what I hear.
[13:20.89]You want to hear some play game and talk at the same time?
[13:23.57]Let me rephrase that.
[13:25.55]Playing... I don't want to do that.
[13:27.55]Playing... No.
[13:28.17]I want to... You mother... Here we go.
[13:32.31]When I have to focus in a game... We talked about this in Dark Souls.
[13:39.36]There's no speaking allowed.
[13:40.88]I have to concentrate.
[13:42.40]In a game where you actually have to... See?
[13:44.42]See what I'm talking about?
[13:46.83]Can't hit the broadside of a fucking bat!
[13:51.49]Got that guy, though.
[13:52.89]Yeah, yeah!
[13:53.85]Yeah, yeah!
[13:54.89]Dude, I'm stuck in the door!
[13:55.89]Okay.
[13:59.73]Uh... Wearing a Star Wars shirt?
[14:02.75]Oh, that's right.
[14:03.81]I just heard about that.
[14:05.63]For Carrie Fisher.
[14:06.79]That's unfortunate.
[14:10.60]She was great in Star Wars.
[14:12.30]She was...
[14:14.53]Overall, I think I'm probably a pretty good person, right?
[14:17.05]Sad stuff.
[14:19.71]But may the Force be with her.
[14:21.36]Rest in peace.
[14:21.90]Let's see the Carrie Fisher.
[14:34.61]Where am I going?
[14:36.79]Oh, right.
[14:37.13]So what I was going to say.
[14:39.07]is... so... what the fuck was I gonna say?
[14:41.89]Anybody remember?
[14:42.61]Where was I going with that?
[14:43.69]I was going there with something.
[14:45.09]Oh, alright, here's what I was going with.
[14:47.43]Okay, so I spent Christmas at Burger Boy's, actually.
[14:50.79]I went to Burger Boy's house for Christmas on late, late, late Christmas Eve.
[14:56.11]And... Like, I had Christmas with my own family.
[14:59.37]And it was great.
[15:00.69]And we ended up doing our Christmas a little early.
[15:03.73]Because my brother-in-law is in the Coast Guard.
[15:06.89]So he wasn't gonna be around.
[15:09.93]there's like something about like spending time with like a like a friend's family it was just so awesome to see how like happy everybody was like giving presents and talking like I was just kind of there just like experiencing his family and it was it was fantastic so if you ever have like the opportunity to like if one of your friends or something you know or like even like a cousin or something like just go into somebody else's house for like a Christmas
[15:37.48]And just watching how happy everybody is.
[15:40.62]And you're just like, oh, everybody's so fucking happy.
[15:42.42]This is awesome.
[15:48.44]So no girlfriend?
[15:50.40]No.
[15:52.89]No.
[15:53.19]I don't have a girlfriend.
[15:57.69]I'm going to get this guy.
[16:03.01]No, I'm not.
[16:13.60]Wow, you got blown right at... Did he just shoot me after he died?
[16:18.57]Did I just die after he... Did anybody catch what happened?
[16:27.72]Yeah, I missed resubs.
[16:29.14]I'm so sorry, guys.
[16:32.10]I try to be on top of that every few minutes.
[16:33.64]It's just glitching.
[16:36.72]Glitch, glitch, glitch.
[16:37.64]Alright, hold on.
[16:38.08]Let me see who I missed here.
[16:41.40]Oh, God.
[16:43.90]$15.
[16:43.92]$15 from Crocomire.
[16:45.57]Thanks, Crocomire.
[16:47.15]Merry post-Christmas while I got you.
[16:49.39]While I got your and the chat's attention, I wanted your opinion on this stream idea.
[16:55.29]And he says, hashtag charity.
[16:56.61]Thanks a lot, dude.
[17:01.82]I'm going to just drink alone and play video games, drinking whiskey.
[17:06.92]I don't drink that much.
[17:07.76]You know that I don't drink that much.
[17:09.22]Come on.
[17:14.24]What was the pro tip?
[17:15.21]The pro tip was to spend Christmas with other people if you if you have the opportunity to.
[17:21.59]If you just spend it with your family, like it's cool to get that other side of the coin where you see another family's Christmas.
[17:31.56]It was just great.
[17:32.26]I was just drinking wine, like watching his family open presents.
[17:36.43]It was like I was watching my own personal like family happy live stream of like his whole family.
[17:42.51]It was fucking fantastic.
[17:43.47]I loved it.
[17:43.83]I'm just sitting there drinking like wine.
[17:47.48]Like, oh, what did he get?
[17:48.42]Did he get a sweater?
[17:49.42]Oh, cool.
[17:51.12]It was fucking cool.
[17:51.90]I loved it.
[17:55.20]Let me see this straw poll.
[17:56.28]What is this straw poll?
[17:59.63]Drunk streamer gives bad.
[18:00.91]I'm not drinking right now.
[18:05.83]Kind of needs to work.
[18:09.79]I spent it with the rats.
[18:11.13]But no, thank you, Crocomire, for $15.
[18:12.59]That's great.
[18:13.53]I see you.
[18:13.81]Also, Sam, thanks for the $400.
[18:15.47]Fahrenheit, thanks for the $400.
[18:16.19]Fahrenheit gave actually $500.
[18:19.23]Thanks a lot, dude, Fahrenheit.
[18:22.05]Who gave the 2,800 bits like 15 minutes ago?
[18:27.37]You give $28?
[18:27.69]How did I not see it?
[18:28.65]This is what I'm talking about.
[18:29.63]Like, I can't see your name.
[18:32.98]Why does my Twitch alert suck right now?
[18:36.10]But thank you.
[18:36.52]Whoever that was, thank you so much for the $28, dude.
[18:38.54]You're a fucking... You're a legend.
[18:41.12]Purple, thanks for the $10.
[18:41.88]Bye.
[18:42.44]Hey, Jerry, Merry Christmas.
[18:43.82]Ever thought about playing Lost Planet 2?
[18:45.32]I'll put it on the list.
[18:49.10]Put it on the list.
[18:51.64]That sounds really awkward.
[18:52.89]Strange man state.
[18:53.87]These are... Burger Boy's like my best friend.
[18:57.29]I didn't just go to, like, a stranger's house and, like, drink wine and watch him, like, fucking open presents.
[19:02.07]This is a guy that I've been, like, buddies with for, like, 30 years.
[19:05.30]I know his whole family's great.
[19:10.26]I didn't just, like, hey, can I come to your house for Christmas?
[19:12.22]I'm just gonna drink wine and watch you.
[19:15.44]Uh, Mr. Hybie, thanks for the bits, dude.
[19:17.24]1500.
[19:18.17]Thanks for everything this year and now.
[19:19.33]Orc song.
[19:19.89]No.
[19:20.37]Oh, fuck, I said it.
[19:21.29]I said orc song.
[19:22.99]I actually just said it out loud.
[19:24.61]Now I have to do it, like, in, like, an hour.
[19:28.22]But thanks a lot, guys.
[19:31.02]Let's keep playing.
[19:34.58]Oh, fuck!
[19:35.34]I got kicked.
[19:36.96]Whoa, that's too bad.
[19:37.94]Let's go Cripple Creek.
[19:45.26]Stream's over.
[19:45.74]Stream's not over.
[19:46.78]We just started.
[19:49.68]Why?
[19:50.14]Every time, I need a new monitor.
[19:53.18]Why is this so difficult right now?
[19:54.40]Come on, man.
[19:57.50]Whatever I don't know what it is with today, but when I fall screen this game and even when I don't My whole other monitor like goes nuts and I can't see what anyone's saying What's wrong with star I saw he was playing a He was playing a Skyrim super edition, right Alright, this is a three-team shootout now
[20:26.10]So I'm on this side.
[20:27.72]The team I was on previously has to go.
[20:29.44]No, that's my guy.
[20:34.66]Oh, Star, did you host me?
[20:35.42]Well, thanks, dude.
[20:36.90]Hope you had a good permadeath stream.
[20:44.87]Hide.
[20:47.31]I got to imagine that was probably fairly difficult.
[20:49.77]I just got destroyed.
[20:55.80]Did you end up beating the game?
[21:02.60]Did you beat the whole game in one life with two times, times two and a half damage?
[21:17.21]So many here.
[21:18.53]Too many people on the other team here.
[21:24.26]God there's nothing I could do there.
[21:25.54]He's joking So proud of him He beat it first he beat it twice what no no way I don't believe it He needs like one hit somebody shoot him shoot that guy somebody get him
[21:55.76]Oh, my God.

[22:15.45]Thanks for the laughs.
[22:16.03]Will you be having another New Year's stream?
[22:18.90]Oh, I forgot about the New Year's stream last year.
[22:20.70]Well, first of all, dude, that's like the second, third, or fourth potential.
[22:26.20]I thought that was a stream thing.
[22:28.42]I didn't think that was even in this game, but you've given a lot of money this past year, dude, and that's fucking incredibly generous of you.
[22:36.94]Happy holidays to you, man.
[22:38.48]Thanks a lot.
[22:54.37]But they say... Now we'll have another New Year's dream.
[22:58.01]I am actually not going to be around for New Year's.
[23:00.11]I'm going out for New Year's.
[23:02.61]I will not be here.
[23:07.11]So I will not be at my computer...

[26:48.70]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[26:49.92]I gotta get this fixed.
[26:51.68]Hold on.
[26:52.05]Because I seriously can't see a damn thing.

[26:57.41]Purple, thanks for the bits.
[26:58.29]Jay Dizzle, thanks for the 100.
[27:00.69]Breenland, thanks for the 500.
[27:01.79]Jerma confirmed.

[27:05.53]No.
[27:07.49]Ring-a-ding-ding bits, thanks for the... Is the charity thing still going on?
[27:12.24]Thanks, MultiTrip, for the 10 bucks.
[27:14.25]If the charity thing is still happening, make sure you add hashtag charity.
[27:17.63]So, a portion of that money is given from Twitch to Doctors Without Borders.
[27:26.33]If that's still going on, absolutely still do it.
[27:29.65]There's no reason not to.
[27:33.17]Please continue to do that if you're going to give any amount of this.
[27:38.46]I didn't even need to drink that.
[27:44.73]Star told me to go in hard.
[27:45.91]Alright, fine.
[27:47.49]You got it.
[27:48.16]Hey, Star.
[27:49.24]This one's for you.
[27:54.22]Star, if you're still watching.
[27:56.80]This one's for you.
[27:59.10]He's been, you know, like 2016, talk about friends.
[28:01.24]He's been such a good friend over the years.
[28:02.78]It's like, let's appreciate my friend.
[28:05.56]You know what I mean?
[28:05.98]Let's go.
[28:18.53]Got a relog.
[28:21.39]Wait, what?
[28:26.82]Ah!
[28:31.58]I feel like I just got electrocuted.
[28:33.22]This guy's doing this weird crouch mechanic.
[28:45.61]I'm gonna pretend that was me.
[28:49.38]I want to get on the train.
[28:50.28]Break both my legs.
[28:53.06]The train's got the money, man.
[28:57.73]You want the cash?
[28:58.45]It's on the train.
[29:07.49]Alright.
[29:08.57]I keep getting a three and then it keeps resetting.
[29:12.03]Let's go to... I don't care.
[29:13.71]It doesn't matter where we go.
[29:15.41]I wish I could pick that.
[29:19.49]Thank you for saving my life because I apparently could not hit that guy to save my life.
[29:26.73]One shot.
[29:27.15]That's not smart to go in there with one shot.
[29:32.95]I could have just got on the train, but 22 health is not... I'm talking comedy here.
[29:44.75]Yeah.
[29:48.68]Come on, one more hit.
[29:51.72]I was doing 40 damage.
[29:52.78]I gotta get this gun out of here.
[29:53.90]We're changing guns after this, for sure.
[29:55.27]Remember when Jerma talked about writing that book?
[30:02.01]Hey, you guys, remember when Jerma talked about...
[30:22.55]Remember when Gerber talked about writing that book?
[30:23.84]Remember when Gerber talked about, like, making a video game?
[30:26.14]Remember when Gerber talked about, like, going to Disney World and getting free snacks?
[30:37.79]What?
[30:38.11]No way!
[30:38.93]Hacker!
[30:39.81]He's a hacker!
[30:42.19]No, he's not.
[30:42.63]Don't worry, he's not.
[30:46.76]Just walk by that guy, man.
[30:51.45]Three-person shootout.
[30:52.41]There's too many people around.
[30:54.29]There's like 75 people in this server.
[30:57.93]Where am I?
[30:58.93]Third place?
[30:59.75]Fourth place?
[31:00.69]We can get up to third.
[31:01.45]Come on.
[31:03.27]No, I'm supposed to change my gun.
[31:05.47]I'm gonna go... Go back to the skull field.
[31:09.86]Left-handed.
[31:10.42]I was in the menu.
[31:19.12]I'm fine.
[31:23.60]It's the best gun in the game.
[31:30.21]I love this thing.
[31:32.03]This thing is the most satisfying thing to shoot.
[31:33.55]Remember when I said I would beatbox for you?
[31:37.01]You know, I was actually... It's a true story.
[31:39.69]I was actually practicing.
[31:43.07]I have one health.
[31:46.39]Not anymore.
[31:51.03]Thank you for the subs, guys.
[31:53.72]But yes, I actually was, like, practicing that.
[31:55.92]Because I want to make sure I can still do it.
[32:01.42]Need help.
[32:04.46]Why am I not rolling?
[32:06.52]Oh, yeah, the McCree, McCree.
[32:09.06]Come on.
[32:10.18]Come on.
[32:11.28]Ah.
[32:23.68]Crap.
[32:25.98]Why am I using the opposite hand?
[32:27.02]Because left-handed specialist is more accurate with single shots than right-handed.
[32:37.26]You know what?
[32:40.22]Just fucking shoot me.
[32:41.00]Just kill me.
[32:42.06]Just do it.

[33:07.50]I couldn't move.
[33:08.70]I couldn't move.
[33:10.08]I was stuck in the train.
[33:12.76]I kicked the train and it got me stuck in.

[41:00.26]Like I'll drink on New Year's.
[41:01.62]I'll hold on.
[41:07.81]Why does everybody have a machete?

[41:50.13]Pick it up!
[41:50.69]Pick up the... Why?
[41:52.67]Why?
[41:54.09]God damn it.
[41:56.41]I was very... I was... Whatever.
[41:59.85]You guys know I am upset.
[42:00.79]It's okay.
[42:01.29]Don't worry about it.
[42:06.92]Hey, remember this joke?
[42:11.75]Got him.
[42:17.63]Right in the head.
[42:23.13]Still somebody on that bar?
[42:26.16]No.
[42:28.68]Hey, excuse me.
[42:32.64]Excuse me.
[42:34.18]Excuse you, too.
[42:35.72]I'm out of bullets.
[42:40.65]Come on, get me out of there.
[42:41.51]Get me, get me, get me, get me, get me.
[42:45.09]Hide.
[42:46.85]Thank God you're here.
[42:48.43]You are gonna... You are seriously a savior right now.
[42:52.96]Keep the dream alive, man.
[42:54.14]Keep it alive for me.
[42:55.00]I need five.
[42:57.49]But if I can hit one time... Come on, save me again.
[43:00.13]Be like a... There we go.
[43:01.23]There we go.
[43:01.63]Nice.
[43:02.43]Five.
[43:02.67]Come on.
[43:09.51]One shot.
[43:11.29]Just took all that whiskey.
[43:12.25]What a terrible team player I am.
[43:19.34]Should have at least shared that with someone.
[43:21.68]No, I'm just a piece of shit.
[43:23.18]That's all I am.
[43:27.94]Okay, there's something wrong here.
[43:30.62]Okay, that was weird.
[43:33.07]This guy right here doesn't even know.
[43:36.13]I swear to God.
[43:37.21]Like, where was that guy?
[43:38.97]Does anybody know where that guy was?
[43:39.79]He was just sitting there waiting for me?
[43:42.65]Come on.
[43:43.49]What?
[43:48.14]No, this thing sucks.
[43:48.68]I don't want that.
[43:54.52]Okay.
[44:00.17]Three-team shootout.
[44:02.93]Welcome to three-team shootout.
[44:04.35]Don't worry.
[44:07.63]There's definitely a fucking guy behind you.
[44:11.16]And there's another guy over here, too.
[44:12.36]Because apparently there's always at least one person.
[44:19.38]Time to change guns.
[44:20.49]I think.
[44:20.73]Let's get into that point.
[44:33.35]I was trying to get the gun.
[44:34.31]I was just trying to get my gun back.
[44:43.38]Too drunk to shoot.
[44:45.02]Ah, life.
[44:47.58]Try the Remington.
[44:48.96]I tried it last time.
[44:50.40]I actually didn't really like it that much.
[44:53.80]Seemed to take like three or four shots to get anybody.
[45:04.66]I'll take three or four in a row right there.
[45:06.42]Come on, give me five in a row.
[45:10.40]There it is.
[45:13.32]You guys get a comedy cam for like three seconds.
[45:16.69]Let's not screw this up yet.
[45:20.25]Oh, that guy was crouching.
[45:33.78]Damn it.
[45:39.45]Comedy cam incoming.
[45:45.57]If we get 10, I'll put two cameras on.
[45:50.82]One on my crotch.
[45:53.50]One on my face.
[45:56.58]I don't even have two cameras.
[45:57.60]That's not possible.
[45:59.08]That was a joke.
[46:02.38]Ah, we didn't make it.
[46:04.21]Oh, well.
[46:05.27]Okay, let's turn it on for you guys.
[46:07.23]Hey!
[46:07.59]Kill a crocodile.
[46:08.21]Thanks.
[46:08.91]1500 again.
[46:09.29]Oh, there it is.
[46:10.25]Okay, the pace bin was a stream.
[46:11.99]Let's see.
[46:12.33]What is this?
[46:15.01]Jerma's shitty game Saturday?
[46:18.33]Okay.
[46:23.18]This is actually not a bad idea.
[46:24.44]Like, I had this kind of slight idea before.
[46:27.94]Remember we played, like, Zemarian?
[46:30.42]I picked, like, a random game on Steam.
[46:33.80]Alright, here's your cam.
[46:34.80]Let me give you a fucking camera.
[46:37.21]Hold on.
[46:38.47]Hold on.
[46:38.85]Do I look okay?
[46:42.49]Do I look okay?
[46:46.07]I hope so.
[46:48.68]I'm so nervous.
[46:49.86]I don't like being on camera.
[46:53.24]What's even in my room right now?
[46:54.78]Can you guys see that like my dirty ass room?
[46:59.06]I gotta look taller.
[47:00.16]I gotta look bigger.
[47:02.08]See?
[47:02.82]This makes you look a little taller.
[47:06.93]Ew.
[47:07.01]Somebody just said, Ew, ban that guy for life.
[47:09.59]The guy that just said, Ew, fucking permanently ban that guy.
[47:12.61]I don't want to see him again.
[47:14.95]Ten seconds.
[47:19.70]Clorox?
[47:20.48]Yeah, I'm cleaning up.
[47:21.66]The guy can't clean his room up?
[47:23.08]That's not fair.
[47:24.22]Come on.
[47:26.14]Take my ad bits.
[47:27.99]Well, thanks for the bits, dude.
[47:30.87]Those sound panels.
[47:31.77]These are great.
[47:32.33]They're great.
[47:32.63]They're expensive, but they're fucking wonderful.
[47:34.25]They do fantastic work down here.
[47:38.59]I do have pants on.
[47:39.25]I could prove that if I wanted to, but we don't have the crotch cam set up.
[47:44.19]Eventually, I promise, I will get a crotch cam set up.
[47:49.55]50 people said ew.
[47:52.27]Ew.
[47:53.18]I don't like this guy.
[47:55.49]This is why I don't do face cam, because I want to just be like a... Look, I... I just want to be a piece of shit.
[48:00.45]I don't want you to know how much of a piece of shit I am in real life.
[48:03.66]I want you to have that, like, one image of me where... I probably got kicked from the server already, by the way.
[48:07.58]I want that one image of me that you guys have that you're like, oh, yeah, that's what he looks like.
[48:12.23]I don't want this to be it.
[48:14.35]I haven't even done my makeup.
[48:23.25]I love your hair.
[48:25.81]Get it off!
[48:26.49]I don't like it.
[48:30.52]How do I keep my teeth so white?
[48:32.00]I eat a Snickers before I go to bed every night.
[48:40.70]Yeah, I eat like a king-size Reese's right before I go to sleep.
[48:47.19]And I don't even eat it all the way.
[48:50.05]I just mash Reese's into my mouth and don't even swallow it.
[48:52.91]Just keep it there until tomorrow morning.
[48:57.43]Fucking machete.
[49:01.19]I hate the machete.
[49:02.73]Now I gotta lower myself again.
[49:04.27]I gotta be short again because I can't reach my keyboard.
[49:06.85]Let's get this guy.
[49:11.55]What do you say?
[49:14.03]Oh god, I suck.
[49:17.00]Suck, I'll never be I'll never look I'll never be able to fucking fly like the big boys There's scooters in there And they're cool cars, and I don't have a cool car.
[49:31.81]I want a cool car though.
[49:32.83]What kind of car do I have?
[49:35.37]an old Chevy Barely gets the job done.
[49:38.37]It's making all kinds of noise.
[49:39.45]I got a regular for an inspection
[49:51.56]Speaking of the clown car joke, you need to make sure gorillas are driving the car.
[49:56.12]That's a good idea.
[49:57.76]Well, no, I mean, for the next rumble, you better be certain that there's going to be at least one car gorilla in the next rumble.
[50:09.55]Clown car inspection.
[50:11.15]Well, that's only if I hit double zero this weekend.
[50:14.01]That's important.
[50:17.73]Double zero this weekend means clown car.
[50:19.75]I'll like drive the clown car on stream.
[50:21.91]You know what I'm saying?
[50:25.05]We'll do a clown car stream.
[50:26.99]This is an IRL section now.
[50:28.35]This is a real life section of Twitch now.
[50:31.64]If I have, if I hit fucking double zero, I will drive a clown car on stream.
[50:36.66]I'll drive it into a wall.
[50:40.60]Alright, what if I hit it?
[50:44.84]What am I trying to do here?
[50:49.22]I will drive a clown car into a fucking wall.
[50:52.85]In a full clown costume.
[51:03.21]Can't drive the car on stream.
[51:04.61]No, I'll be driving.
[51:05.71]Someone else will be filming it.
[51:07.25]To drive a clown car into a wall, they go like 14 miles per hour.
[51:12.96]It's not gonna have a camera with me.
[51:14.54]Someone's gonna be filming it.
[51:18.17]I'll have both.
[51:18.75]I'm gonna have both.
[51:19.35]I'll have my hands on ten and two.
[51:20.47]Give me a knife!
[51:27.83]Put on a diaper for a stream?
[51:28.89]No.
[51:31.81]Alright, fine.

[59:04.29]Imagine having a permanent clown all year for 2017.
[59:06.03]I would just, he would just be paid to just come on stream with a facecam like every, like randomly and just like spin one of those devices.
[59:13.98]And like honk his nose and run away.
[59:15.06]It'd be fucking incredible.
[59:22.51]You shotgun.
[59:23.75]I don't want it.
[59:27.71]Don't want your shotgun.
[59:28.61]Even though I probably should.
[59:29.35]I'm going to be way down.

[60:00.06]What the fuck?
[60:00.82]I'm surrounded!
[60:03.16]I'm surrounded by assholes!
[60:10.37]Somebody's happy.
[60:11.81]What's up?
[60:13.82]Too much fucking chaos over there.
[60:15.38]Get me out.
[60:16.50]Get me the hell away from this.
[60:19.22]I forgot it's a source game.
[60:20.84]I forgot it was a source game.
[60:21.94]Sorry.
[60:31.17]Alright, we're good.
[60:31.73]We'll be fine.
[60:34.31]Just subscribed after you complimented my name.
[60:36.05]That's how you grow your audience.
[60:37.17]Well, cassock.
[60:40.94]Thanks for joining.
[60:42.62]Welcome to the fucking family, man.
[60:48.67]I had so many good guns there, but it just... God damn it.
[61:01.94]Let's get this.
[61:02.50]Let's do some right-handed.
[61:07.43]No more left-handed.
[61:08.05]We'll go right-handed for now.
[61:09.87]Try to fan some people.
[61:16.70]For the first time all stream, the gun is in the right-handed position.
[61:20.80]I don't want that.
[61:22.84]That thing sucks.
[61:45.04]Thank God there's teammates.
[61:46.96]Right hand on sub.
[61:53.90]I need a drink.
[61:55.66]Right now.
[61:57.40]Right now.
[61:57.82]What the hell is everybody?
[62:04.34]It's a three-team shootout, man.
[62:10.39]Ah, let's go with... I want... Cold Navy right-handed is probably better.
[62:23.13]This thing's a little too slow right-handed.
[62:29.46]Well, okay.
[62:36.30]I'm on a different team now.
[62:37.42]That's what happened.
[62:38.02]I auto...
[62:40.77]That's not a... There's like four guys I don't want to fight against.
[62:43.48]I'll take this.
[62:52.28]Try to make something happen with the coach gun.

[63:23.03]There's one of the green... There's two green numbers.
[63:24.74]Zero and double zero.
[63:32.74]I contributed to that.
[63:42.77]Kicking somebody kill him somebody kill that guy Blames it on the gun.

[65:41.27]Kill him.
[65:42.11]Kill...
[65:50.63]That was like, that was so dumb.
[66:05.94]I was trying to be like a distraction for that guy.
[66:09.84]Dead.
[66:12.91]Holy shit.
[66:14.37]Okay, I'm alive.
[66:23.18]Let's keep it going.
[66:25.54]Need more whiskey.
[66:31.69]Good shot.
[66:32.37]Okay, here we go.
[66:33.35]Ah, right when he's... The guy was like a ghost.
[66:36.59]I just got killed by a fucking ghost.
[66:39.33]Gotta get a 10 kill streak.
[66:40.89]It's gonna happen.
[66:41.45]I got like a 16 or a 17 last time I played.
[66:43.72]Let's see if I can do it again.
[66:46.26]Probably not, though.
[66:55.57]Too much smoke.
[67:05.39]Ah, here comes another guy.
[67:06.24]Right around the corner, somebody show up.
[67:14.16]That was a teammate.
[67:14.98]Just watch your whole area.
[67:28.49]Where is this?
[67:31.62]No.
[67:44.91]None of those hit him.
[67:46.29]None of those hit him.
[67:46.95]Sometimes I don't understand.
[67:48.95]Sometimes I just don't get it.
[67:53.45]I'm dead.
[67:56.85]Let's do the bow.
[68:12.70]Not sure this is a good place for the bow.
[68:13.86]Oh, I got him in the head.
[68:19.82]That's good.
[68:28.42]Where you coming from?
[68:28.98]Come on.
[68:36.21]Come on, through the window.
[68:37.63]Come on!
[68:40.43]Come on!
[68:42.51]Come on!
[68:48.50]God damn it!
[69:03.66]Watch your head.
[69:04.24]I just kept getting, like, in the windowsill.
[69:13.43]I wanna go to a server that's not three-team shootout.
[69:15.99]Can I do that?
[69:16.89]I'm doing that next.
[69:18.51]It's just too chaotic.
[69:19.45]There's too many people.
[69:20.34]There's too many fucking teams.
[69:38.19]Now there's just no one.
[69:38.91]There's just nobody.
[69:40.43]Nobody's here anymore.
[69:46.01]Give me it.
[69:47.61]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[69:48.55]I just freaked out.
[69:49.19]Come on.
[69:50.47]Two seconds.
[69:51.09]Two seconds.
[69:51.69]Give me the peacemaker.
[69:53.04]Give me the peacemaker.
[69:53.94]No, the walker.
[69:54.34]The walker.
[69:54.62]That's what I mean.
[70:01.92]Oh, what?
[70:05.60]Right when I get it.
[70:08.43]God damn it.
[70:11.49]I want a two-team shootout.
[70:13.15]And I don't want 100 ping.
[70:15.95]Where am I going to go?
[70:20.56]Fistful of Zombies?
[70:23.56]What is this?
[70:27.26]Okay.
[70:28.14]Let's play it.
[70:33.16]Let's play Fistful of Zombies.
[70:37.81]I'm sure it'll be fun.
[70:39.85]Well, maybe it won't be.
[70:45.37]Esperados, alright.
[70:46.79]So what?
[70:48.63]How does this work?
[70:53.15]Alright.
[70:53.55]Uh, uh, brains.
[70:57.10]Alright, so we have to eat people's brains.
[70:59.08]And we get money.
[71:00.98]This is a guy with a fucking machine gun.
[71:04.40]Okay.
[71:05.80]That makes perfect sense.
[71:08.95]Do I have any abilities?
[71:15.92]Holy sh- Okay, that's a good guy.
[71:17.58]We're like skeletons.
[71:21.32]This is so dumb.
[71:22.91]We're skeletons with hat-ons.
[71:24.89]Hat-ons.
[71:25.63]Hats-on.
[71:29.35]Get up there.
[71:36.13]Okay.
[71:39.01]Wait a minute.
[71:50.61]Hold on a second.
[71:51.44]Smooth jazz is coming.
[71:52.96]I cannot listen to songs.
[71:54.74]Okay, good.
[71:56.06]I don't want to hear any songs.
[71:57.10]I'm a good guy.
[71:57.78]I'm a good guy?
[72:02.30]I think I'm on this team now, apparently.
[72:04.40]Not sure how this works.
[72:08.17]Can I pick my loadout?
[72:10.71]Oh.
[72:11.79]This is weird.
[72:14.33]Where are the zombies?
[72:22.36]Where...
[72:32.13]I don't see any zombies.
[72:35.43]All I hear is Santa Claus.
[72:36.58]I feel like there's way too many guys with guns and not enough zombies.
[72:49.88]Oh, got him.
[72:52.08]Oh, hold on.
[72:53.78]Hold on, there was a zombie there.
[72:59.20]Did it respawn?
[73:06.66]They're like see-through.
[73:07.78]Why am I not getting any money?
[73:16.29]Oh, shit.
[73:19.29]What's that guy doing?
[73:20.25]That guy had an opportunity to get me and he didn't do it.
[73:32.07]Free kills.
[73:32.65]I'll take them.
[73:41.46]That did actually scare me.
[73:43.86]No, now, okay, I get it.
[73:51.39]What was that?
[74:01.80]You know what I want to play?
[74:02.38]I want to play gun game.
[74:03.81]Gun game was actually pretty fun.
[74:04.97]I almost won it a few times.
[74:05.89]Let's play some gun game, man.
[74:08.81]What do you say?
[74:20.35]Who has the gun?
[74:20.97]Yeah, it's PeeWee.
[74:27.67]Reload.
[74:29.45]Enemy spotted.
[74:30.29]I see him!
[74:42.48]I gotta say, I see him, when I get a guy in my sights.
[74:48.22]I see him!
[74:54.04]Okay, I'm about to leave.
[74:58.77]Alright, that was fun, I guess.
[75:02.09]Alright, let's go with Gun Game.
[75:03.08]Gun Game.
[75:03.48]Gun Game.
[75:03.86]If anyone's even playing on a Gun Game server right now, I'd love to play on it.
[75:11.24]Can I just type in Gun Game?
[75:16.52]Gun Game.
[75:19.43]Space Jam.
[75:21.49]Custom GG Gun Game.
[75:24.19]Space Jam.
[75:25.21]Um...
[75:35.26]I want to play on a regular team.
[75:36.56]Break bad.
[75:38.82]Team play, two team shootout.
[75:39.90]I want to do two team shootout.
[75:42.68]We're doing two team shootout.
[75:45.15]Don't do it.
[75:45.75]Don't go to Space Jam.
[75:48.29]Well, I didn't.
[75:50.17]Two team shootout.
[75:51.03]I want to show you guys how good I am at video games.
[75:53.51]You know what I'm saying?
[75:56.72]Everyone's going to laugh at that and I'm going to get made fun of, but you know, it's okay.
[76:02.65]Oh, brass knuckles too.
[76:04.63]I'll try to use this.
[76:11.53]Two team shootout.
[76:12.85]This is the Fistful of Frags I like.
[76:17.57]Two teams.
[76:19.26]Whoever wins, wins.
[76:21.40]No third man versus machine team to worry about.
[76:24.94]The yellow team.
[76:25.60]Remember for the longest time everyone thought in TF2 there was gonna be like a green team or like a grey team or something?
[76:41.50]Shit.
[76:41.94]72 damage didn't kill him.
[76:43.38]Holy God.
[76:45.55]Yikes.
[76:46.89]That guy got fucking wrecked.
[76:49.49]10 health.
[77:00.51]Green team.
[77:03.29]I swear to God.
[77:05.69]For the longest time, back in 2008.
[77:06.79]It's like, oh dude, there's hidden files.
[77:12.88]That Valve has a green team.
[77:22.32]Did you guys datamine that shit?
[77:24.12]Yeah.
[77:24.68]It's a green team.
[77:25.34]I'll go this way.
[77:38.28]Is that a guy?
[77:43.05]No.
[77:46.67]I would have got that guy.
[77:47.65]You all know it.
[77:50.71]My team is doing very well.
[77:53.36]Not giving me any opportunities to... That should have hit.
[78:01.15]That shouldn't have hit.
[78:05.03]I don't like these solo shotguns.
[78:07.33]Too unreliable if you miss one time.
[78:09.17]I feel like that should have hit.
[78:13.08]I really do.
[78:19.68]I really do.
[78:22.64]Hmmmm well.
[78:33.64]What the fuck? Ah!
[78:38.64]He had the oneshot gun. He had the fucking golden gun.
[78:41.64]And I like just try- I knew if he hit me once I was dead. So I was trying to bait it out and I didn't get it.
[78:46.64]I kinda got it.
[78:52.64]I'm getting rid of this gun.
[78:57.64]Did I hit him? I don't know.
[79:08.96]See what I mean?
[79:09.86]Like, 82 damage.
[79:12.58]For one shot to hit him in, like, the neck for 82 damage, I'm gonna lose that firefight every single time.
[79:23.15]Wrecked.
[79:25.59]I did just get wrecked, you're right.
[79:27.19]It's okay.
[79:29.87]See, look, look at that!
[79:31.37]Reload, reload, reload!
[79:39.94]If I can sneak up on this guy.
[79:41.08]Right in the head.
[79:42.32]Nope.
[79:43.92]Just a C+.
[79:44.40]Nope.
[79:46.68]Didn't even hit him.
[79:47.24]God damn.
[79:52.36]Alright.
[79:55.43]Get rid of this gun.
[79:55.95]Last round with this gun.
[79:56.65]I'm going to go back to the Schofield left-handed.
[80:01.33]With quickdraw.
[80:02.93]And... That's fine.
[80:09.16]This is the worst rifle.
[80:10.06]It gives you a lot of points when you get kills, though, I think.
[80:20.01]Sometimes there's a person sitting on that bench.
[80:28.63]Just getting C's with that gun.
[80:29.91]No more C's.
[80:30.81]No more C pluses.
[80:33.89]Shoot a guy, you get a C. That guy gets an A+.
[80:36.52]And guess what?
[80:37.44]The guy that I just shot, just, you know, he gets to shoot me.
[80:40.00]He gets to get three Fs.
[80:42.04]Like 40, 40, 40.
[80:43.20]I get a fucking C. I failed both tests.
[80:46.74]Look at how much... See how many tests I'm failing?
[80:53.26]52.
[80:53.50]Failed.
[80:59.57]All you gotta do is fail four tests.
[81:09.38]Guys, it's like... Somebody needs to sneeze on that guy, seriously.
[81:12.02]He's dead.
[81:16.12]Oh, I got a B- on that one.
[81:32.51]Paranoid.
[81:33.01]Shit, come on.
[81:46.62]That guy went into a portal.
[81:59.51]One shot.
[82:00.19]Don't come over here.
[82:01.21]Not yet.
[82:02.23]Don't come over here yet.
[82:04.51]Okay, now you can come over here.
[82:10.49]Don't come over here.
[82:11.03]Nobody come over here yet.
[82:11.77]Don't come over here.
[82:12.83]God, this is the worst spot.
[82:17.66]I need whiskey.
[82:18.40]I'm going back down.
[82:23.73]What did you just do?
[82:26.55]Here's the whiskey rum.
[82:30.47]Dangerous to go in there.
[82:33.46]Drink it up.
[82:36.76]Don't do that.
[82:37.20]You just scared the shit out of me, man.
[82:39.56]This guy's scaring the hell out of me.
[82:40.74]Music.
[82:42.04]I need music here.
[82:56.51]I don't need the liquor.
[82:57.63]Well, I knew it heals me.
[83:02.65]Sometimes you have to drink a couple of boozes.
[83:07.97]What do the kids say these days?
[83:09.51]That guy's lit.
[83:11.34]What do the kids say?
[83:14.26]Yo, that guy's lit.
[83:20.56]Oof!
[83:21.28]That guy's lit!
[83:22.40]I'm getting that guy- What?!
[83:24.76]What?!
[83:24.92]That guy- Hit that guy fucking- somebody does- That guy only has 1 HP.
[83:28.94]Don't freak this out.
[83:29.86]Hold on.
[83:30.42]Slow it down.
[83:30.99]He's right here.
[83:35.09]Did you get him?
[83:37.47]Jesus, thought that was a bad guy.
[83:48.83]91 health, I'm okay.
[84:00.09]Going up top, gonna aim down.
[84:00.99]Fuck!
[84:04.77]Don't!
[84:08.93]Fuck!
[84:13.63]I fucking freaked out.
[84:15.32]He had a shotgun thing.
[84:17.24]Ah, there were too many of them.
[84:18.00]I would have died anyways.
[84:18.66]That's okay.
[84:20.54]We'll go with lucky number 13.
[84:27.30]That's unfortunate.

[86:40.78]Have you ever played Oddworld Stranger's Wrath?
[86:43.47]I have.
[86:45.23]Stranger's Wrath, I played it for like maybe 10 to 20 minutes.
[86:51.08]I actually am not that huge of an Oddworld fan.
[86:56.16]I like that... No, I can do more than that.
[87:01.46]I'll do Volcanic Pistol right-handed.
[87:04.02]With... What the hell is that?
[87:06.14]This one.
[87:06.62]Insatiable.
[87:09.89]I don't think I can do it.
[87:10.99]Right-handed.
[87:11.51]Yeah, I can.
[87:16.01]And quick draw.
[87:18.65]Okay.
[87:20.17]So... The original Oddworld... It was kind of cool.
[87:25.16]I just never really got into them.
[87:27.54]I was a huge fan of them.
[87:32.72]Although I should be, though.
[87:33.74]Because those games...
[87:38.75]Sorry.
[87:41.01]Team balancing you were switched.
[87:41.99]This is what I wanted the whole time.
[87:42.99]That was just a joke life.
[87:50.20]Too far away.
[87:50.84]I gotta get in there.
[88:00.12]Anybody else?
[88:02.89]Need a full Abe's Odyssey playthrough?
[88:05.79]Haven't they remastered that game like three times?
[88:10.79]I feel like there's always like a Abe's Odyssey.
[88:14.00]A hyper extended edition.
[88:16.10]Abe's Odyssey.
[88:16.82]Steam Edition.
[88:18.48]Oddworld.
[88:19.26]Abe's Odyssey.
[88:21.32]In the bundle with the other Odyssey games.
[88:23.38]Remastered Colors.
[88:25.18]Or am I just making that all up?
[88:26.34]I might be.
[88:26.70]Where are the bad guys?
[88:46.47]Alright, honestly, where the hell is everybody?
[89:00.01]I should play Hello Neighbor?
[89:01.91]Isn't that like the scary game where a guy like follows you around in his house?
[89:04.49]I'm gonna hide and reload.
[89:15.90]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[89:16.96]That was a bad place to hide.
[89:17.98]I, like, looked over at chat.
[89:21.06]Oh, well.
[89:23.92]Hello, neighbor sucks.
[89:25.46]Does it?
[89:27.05]I saw, like, a trailer, like, two years ago.
[89:30.51]You, like, go in the guy's house and, like, fuck up his furniture and he, like, tries to find you or something, right?
[89:34.05]I keep getting messed on these spawn points, man.
[89:43.82]This is never a person within, like, 50 yards of me.
[89:47.10]There's that guy down there, but he has the advantage because I'm right-handed.
[89:55.09]I'm not going to switch off.
[89:56.17]I'm right-handed.
[89:56.65]This is not going to work.
[89:57.49]This guy's so bad.
[90:06.01]This guy... Ew!
[90:12.76]Woohoo!
[90:17.01]Carl Monte for the thousand bits.
[90:18.71]Thanks a lot, dude.
[90:19.37]Hey, thanks for the streams.
[90:20.19]I've been having a rough time lately.
[90:22.17]These have cheered me up.
[90:22.85]Well, welcome, man.
[90:23.87]I'm glad you can enjoy these streams.
[90:28.74]Hopefully things get better in your life, dude.
[90:33.46]I wish you the best.
[90:35.80]But thanks for the thousand bits, man.
[90:41.18]I do these streams to hang out, you know?
[90:42.80]I'm gonna flip the fuck out in a second.
[90:50.91]Right-handed.
[90:53.01]I'm using my, like, tree stick for a gun.
[90:58.01]Fucking stink bug gun.
[90:59.31]I don't want this thing anymore.
[91:00.29]Throw this thing in the trash.
[91:08.50]Throw this thing in the trash.
[91:11.61]Where it belongs, man.
[91:20.85]Whiskey heals you.
[91:21.67]Thank you, Tot.
[91:25.41]That's too many.
[91:26.11]Get this gun out of me.
[91:31.10]We'll go with a Mars leg.
[91:32.40]Mare's leg.
[91:34.22]Oh, sawed-off shark in Mars leg.
[91:36.80]I know I'm probably saying that wrong, but you know, sometimes you can't say things correctly all the time.
[91:46.33]Let's do it.
[91:47.95]This is the gun that when you shoot it, you flip it in the air.
[91:49.65]It's fun.
[91:57.32]Yeah, I go out there.
[91:58.02]I eat garbage.
[91:59.44]I eat garbage.
[92:07.90]I don't know how that... That guy just did the equivalent of a taunt.
[92:14.02]You saw it.
[92:14.58]He taunted me.
[92:27.78]Remember when I talked about hating weapons?
[92:30.60]I fucking hate that gun too.
[92:31.86]I hate like every gun.
[92:35.38]I like two guns in this game.
[92:38.32]What is going on right now?
[92:40.50]What is happening?
[92:41.38]Anybody know what the fuck just happened to my body?
[92:44.05]What just happened?
[92:46.43]That guy was shooting like double bullets.
[92:49.13]I was getting hit twice.
[93:01.97]It's fun.
[93:02.59]I hate it.
[93:07.52]I hate every gun that doesn't get me killed.
[93:08.84]Isn't that like how it is with everything, though?
[93:10.14]With every game?
[93:11.10]Oh my god.
[93:16.84]I just got headshot.
[93:17.90]With what weapon?
[93:22.26]I hope you guys like the scorefield stream.
[93:24.21]Because that's like the weapon I can actually play this game with.
[93:32.82]Where are my shots?
[93:34.45]What in the name of God?
[93:37.23]Something going on here?
[93:38.37]Something fishy going on here?
[93:39.59]Am I gonna play Stardew Valley?
[93:43.99]Yes.
[93:48.05]Stardew Valley, will we play it again?
[93:49.35]Alright.
[93:51.53]Alright, for real.
[93:55.44]For real.
[93:57.42]What the, what the, what the heck?
[93:59.04]What the heck, man?
[94:13.29]I don't know what that was.
[94:16.21]I'll take it, though.
[94:17.21]Why not?
[94:21.83]That was a strong hit.
[94:22.57]Yeah.
[94:25.03]1.1 was they added some maps and stuff, but I don't think they added that much significant changes.
[94:30.65]Multiplayer, for sure, is going to be like, I'll play that with somebody on stream, for sure.
[94:53.03]What happened?
[94:59.02]What was that?
[95:01.96]How did I get fucking sniped?
[95:05.02]They added more endgame stuff, did they?
[95:12.98]I want the multiplayer though.
[95:14.46]If that ever does come.
[95:26.71]Castle Miner Z. I don't think I'll ever play Castle Miner Z. I don't even know what the hell that is.
[95:38.86]Let me get him in the heal there.
[95:42.67]Is that like a Minecraft game?
[95:55.54]Alright.
[95:57.26]What is going on here?
[95:59.94]Is he up there?
[96:02.61]Somebody's got to get rid of that guy.
[96:06.95]Somebody's got to shoot that guy down.
[96:11.39]Nobody's got him.
[96:11.91]That would be fucking awesome.
[96:14.73]I'm going for like a pale Mary shot.
[96:17.52]Somebody kill that guy.
[96:29.49]I want to go to the train map.
[96:34.03]The cool train map.
[96:34.81]The one that I like.
[96:35.55]I should play XCOM?
[96:42.35]I'm not sure I have the patience for XCOM.
[96:45.97]Isn't XCOM a lot of... Sort of waiting around and like strategy and... Is that...
[96:58.08]That would have been awesome if I had done that.
[96:59.42]I was against all odds right there.
[97:01.14]You guys know it.
[97:01.68]Come on.
[97:09.31]You've got the rifle up there.
[97:10.21]Good.
[97:18.32]God damn it.
[97:24.58]Far from it.
[97:30.32]You had the Peace Baker.
[97:32.49]I will definitely steal that from you.
[97:33.69]Not good.
[97:44.64]Not good.
[97:47.84]Oh!
[97:58.40]Watch the two spots.
[98:00.83]Heal up and then we'll go.
[98:03.09]Yeah, the Jerma cam spray.
[98:04.21]I don't know why I'm doing that today.
[98:05.49]I never really put on a face cam.
[98:07.89]Don't ask me why I keep turning it on.
[98:11.28]I think it's because I got a haircut today.
[98:12.62]It's like, look at my haircut, Bob.
[98:14.80]Got him.
[98:32.04]Don't be in the eye.
[98:32.62]I just heard a guy with a sharps rifle.
[98:33.76]Get back inside.
[98:39.45]Holiday spirit.
[98:42.69]Maybe.
[98:43.01]I'm a pretty boy, right?
[98:54.88]Please don't come in when I'm drunk.
[98:57.96]Don't come in here when I'm drunk.
[99:04.03]A lot of them to the right.
[99:12.46]I'm not sure I want to go investigate until I have had plenty to drink.
[99:16.00]Oh fuck!
[99:18.50]Where?
[99:29.29]Where?
[99:29.55]Where?
[99:29.93]Where?
[99:30.29]Where?
[99:30.59]Where was he?
[99:34.35]Where was he?
[99:34.91]That guy killed me from fucking nowhere.
[99:38.69]That guy was in Nowheresville.
[99:41.01]God damn it.
[99:43.05]I had a string there for a second.
[99:50.17]Don't peek your head out.
[99:51.59]Be careful.
[99:55.09]You coward.
[100:11.07]They could be anywhere.
[100:15.25]Could even be.
[100:19.71]It could even be.
[100:22.00]What?
[100:22.76]It was obvious.
[100:24.50]He's the red spy.
[100:25.90]Hey, yo, what's up?
[100:27.68]No, it wasn't.
[100:28.12]Oh, yes, I have eyes.
[100:35.79]It seems I am not the only spy.
[100:37.83]Why am I doing this right now?
[100:38.99]What am I doing?
[100:39.85]Why?
[100:40.03]I just, like, I got fucking, like, bored.
[100:47.39]There's a guy behind me, too.
[100:48.67]I'm about to lose it.
[100:56.08]What am I stuck on?
[101:10.31]Do you have to come back?
[101:11.45]Not necessarily.
[101:14.37]Not really.
[101:17.31]What?
[101:18.57]What?
[101:23.40]I don't get this.
[101:25.38]How am I dying from, like, seemingly nowhere?
[101:29.26]I don't get it.
[101:29.88]You guys have magic bullets.
[101:39.48]I want to get off this map.
[101:41.68]You guys get the rifle.
[101:52.49]I'm in the trees.
[101:52.89]You can't even see me.
[101:55.23]Fucking T-Rex.
[101:57.99]I'm gone.
[101:59.87]Fuck that map.
[102:03.27]That map is... I don't like that map.
[102:09.03]Let's go to Bringo Brongo.
[102:15.37]Going to Bringo Brongo instead.
[102:23.01]Do skate, turn on skate three.
[102:27.41]What if I did?
[102:28.04]What if I did?
[102:28.48]No, there's no way I can't.
[102:29.48]It's not even close to being set up right now.
[102:34.88]No rage.
[102:35.26]I didn't rage quit.
[102:39.57]Rage quitting would mean I leave the game.
[102:41.07]I'm still very much in the game.
[102:44.19]I think this is the, uh, like, counter-strike mode where when you die, you're out.
[102:46.98]Okay, I'm gonna shine here.
[102:57.90]And then you get zapped.
[102:59.00]Then you get zapped.
[103:01.32]Watch this.
[103:02.72]Watch this guy die, and then he just gets fucking ZAP'd.
[103:09.64]Come on.
[103:10.48]There's one guy.
[103:11.06]This is the last guy left on the red team.
[103:15.14]Zap.
[103:15.50]Got it.
[103:16.08]Alright.
[103:16.30]Let's do it.
[103:17.60]I'm ready.
[103:17.88]I'm going to play fistful of Counter-Strike.
[103:23.39]Oh, actually, there is a buy menu.
[103:24.81]Would I get 50 bucks?
[103:27.49]Left-handed.
[103:27.91]Oh, God.
[103:29.65]Huh?
[103:30.89]Um, um, um, um.
[103:32.03]Let's go, field.
[103:34.37]Uh... Get out.
[103:37.70]Get out.
[103:38.02]Go.
[103:38.12]Go.
[103:41.72]Got to capture the middle point.
[103:44.68]Now let's do this.
[103:46.16]This map is crazy.
[103:51.88]Did I get dead?
[104:04.07]How are they all dead already?
[104:06.75]We just started.
[104:10.05]Watch out for the train.
[104:13.28]Someone's going to hit by this.
[104:14.08]Does anybody understand what that was?
[104:25.89]Apparently we beat them so badly, I guess.
[104:28.93]Schofield.
[104:31.27]Left-handed with boots.
[104:34.27]Sure.
[104:40.00]Teams look at least a little more even.
[104:49.72]Through the window.
[104:52.28]Through the window.
[104:52.88]Ooh.
[104:58.63]Ooh.
[105:00.95]Got him.
[105:02.53]Through the woodwork.
[105:04.71]He doesn't even know.
[105:05.89]Show your head.
[105:09.43]Show your head.
[105:09.90]Come on.
[105:12.22]No, I got to move.
[105:14.78]Let's go to the Yosemite, whatever that means.
[105:16.50]Alright, we win.
[105:21.09]Sick wall bang.
[105:22.34]Let's go with the carbine this time.
[105:30.80]It's far away.
[105:31.62]Might as well.
[105:37.41]Seems like you could just sit there and shoot across the map.
[105:41.73]Bow and arrow would be good too.
[105:42.67]I think I got auto-balanced, didn't I?
[105:44.27]I'm on the other team.
[105:44.87]I'm on the team with the guys that lose.
[105:50.76]I don't even know where they're supposed to be coming from right now.
[105:52.46]I'm gonna go down.
[105:59.74]No idea.
[106:06.35]I just did 13 damage to somebody.
[106:20.15]Come on.
[106:20.89]What?
[106:22.29]That was right in his head.
[106:25.21]I gotta move.
[106:26.11]We won.
[106:28.48]Play with the worst gun.
[106:29.28]This is a long stream.
[106:30.68]A long stream.
[106:31.70]No.
[106:31.98]A long ranged fight.
[106:38.13]Ooh.
[106:40.21]Peacemaker.
[106:41.25]Left handed.
[106:43.09]Boots.
[106:45.36]I'm just going in.
[106:45.94]Just run.
[106:46.28]I'm not part of any of these fights.
[106:48.26]Just go in.
[106:49.04]If I die, I'm going to take like three people with me.
[106:51.06]Watch this.
[106:53.72]Go, go, go, go.
[106:56.05]Get my back.
[106:57.49]Let's go.
[107:09.73]Hey, alright.
[107:10.23]Here we go.
[107:10.65]Let's go, Phil.
[107:12.25]Left-handed.
[107:14.56]Quick draw.
[107:21.17]Watch this.
[107:22.33]I tried.
[107:23.53]I tried.
[107:24.33]Now we're gonna get first place.
[107:26.93]You ready for a first place and then a face cam?
[107:29.42]Check it out.
[107:30.28]First place face cam.
[107:31.22]And I'm gonna make sure it says, like, you got first place on it.
[107:34.12]It's gonna, like, say it.
[107:36.46]On, like, the stream title.
[107:37.46]You know what I mean?
[107:46.44]First place.
[107:46.94]Incoming.
[107:54.13]The train, somebody on it.
[107:56.43]Bad guy's on it.
[107:57.13]Let's see if I can snipe him off.
[108:01.69]He's gonna stay next to the train.
[108:06.03]Don't go on it.
[108:07.23]Just walk next to it.
[108:09.87]So far, so good.
[108:25.83]Ready your fail fishes?
[108:28.03]Hey!
[108:29.57]Look who's in first place right now!
[108:31.63]I think the, uh, the guy that's, you know, Babe Ruth called the home run is there.
[108:46.34]Reload.
[108:51.49]Just, just don't die.
[108:53.35]And I'll be fine.
[109:00.45]They're all on the other side of the map at this point.
[109:02.89]Let's just run to them.
[109:11.49]Damn it, now he knows I'm here.
[109:12.40]How the fuck?
[109:20.78]Seriously, like the fucking dumbass doorway.
[109:24.98]Bullshit.
[109:26.04]I am actually pissed off about that right now.
[109:32.42]Fucking diarrhea.
[109:34.22]Seriously.
[109:39.82]I have such a straightaway here.
[109:50.93]I'm stuck in the tree.
[109:51.69]Get off the tree, please.
[110:09.26]That would have been so awesome!
[110:16.04]Gotta get out of here.
[110:19.93]AHHHHH!
[110:27.87]Nothing has ammo.
[110:29.77]I'm just freaking out.
[110:31.27]I have no teammates around.
[110:32.53]This is too scary.
[110:36.70]Where are my friends?
[110:43.78]Get me away from this.
[110:44.90]Get me away from this nonsense.
[110:59.22]I gotta get up top.
[111:00.06]I gotta get high.
[111:00.76]This ain't gonna work like this.
[111:06.08]I didn't kill him.
[111:06.62]85.
[111:06.70]Shit.
[111:07.04]It's okay.
[111:08.68]Someone will get that.
[111:19.13]Hey!
[111:19.85]Somebody's shooting me with a sniper rifle.
[111:25.60]I'm gonna reload the other gun while I'm here.
[111:26.90]Just, you know, to have it.
[111:33.56]I hear like a firefight right here.
[111:41.80]Drunk.
[111:42.76]Drunk.
[111:44.38]Thank God I was drunk.
[111:45.73]Because I might not have killed him.
[112:03.96]Watch the back Told you to watch the back you don't want that to happen.
[112:16.51]You don't want to get snuck up on anybody in the train
[112:23.55]I got to get out of here.
[112:25.01]I'm going to get wrapped around.
[112:30.27]I need a better view.
[112:32.69]Dude, I need a better PlayStation view.
[112:38.32]Two health.
[112:39.86]Not good.
[112:40.80]Is he dead?
[112:42.50]Come on, whiskey in here.
[112:44.92]Keep the streak alive.
[112:49.25]I'm so dead.
[112:51.03]One little grenade, one tiny little thing of damage, I'm gonna be screaming my head off.
[113:06.18]That guy just... Okay, that guy killed himself.
[113:12.34]Whiskey.
[113:13.64]Whiskey.
[113:15.00]It looks like... I feel like it's a Dark Souls trap.
[113:18.78]A hollow is gonna come behind me if I go for that whiskey.
[113:32.70]No real opportunity to shoot anybody.
[113:36.71]Fucking drunk.
[113:39.05]Drunk idiot.
[113:48.12]I sensed him.
[113:49.68]I had, seriously, spider sense right there.
[113:54.46]It just tingled.
[113:55.22]My, like, body tingled to turn that way.
[114:00.56]How am I in seventh place?
[114:01.54]I killed a lot of people there.
[114:15.55]Sensed him.
[114:16.13]I didn't sense that guy.
[114:22.23]Did I just get sniped?
[114:24.51]Dogshit.
[114:26.53]I don't believe it for a second.
[114:37.86]It's like... I can't catch a break right now.
[114:53.49]It's like they're in the trees.
[114:59.52]Give me that gun.
[115:10.79]He just dropped it.
[115:11.45]Give it to me.
[115:11.85]It's mine.
[115:14.21]That's my gun now.
[115:17.57]Oh!
[115:18.13]Oh!
[115:19.33]Oh!
[115:27.23]I gotta get off this train get me get the whiskey get the whiskey get the whiskey and be safe and be Comforted and be cuddled Do some cuddling you'll be fine
[115:58.35]That's how you stop a guy.
[116:07.02]That is how you stop a guy.
[116:12.22]Get right there.
[116:13.24]You get him right in the face.
[116:15.46]And he stops going.
[116:16.22]You know?
[116:16.46]He stops moving.
[116:22.26]We have this locked down.
[116:23.26]That's a good thing.
[116:31.39]That guy has a rifle.
[116:32.03]Get that sniper rifle.
[116:34.68]It's a very dangerous weapon.
[116:35.76]Pick it up.
[116:38.26]I just ate that too.
[116:39.24]That sucked.
[116:40.44]I just inhaled that arrow.
[116:41.86]It's a room full of people.
[116:43.34]And I swallowed it.
[116:44.08]I don't understand how that guy does that.
[116:59.01]Honestly, I just died in one... I'm getting a little flustered right now.
[117:04.53]I'm gonna say that.
[117:09.58]Give me a fucking break.
[117:16.50]Yeah, nice try, like, hollow.
[117:18.89]Guy, like, tried to fucking jump-scare me.
[117:28.53]Jeremy's flustered.
[117:29.43]I am.
[117:37.29]Oh!
[117:39.29]Oh!
[117:41.49]Oh!
[117:43.35]No!
[117:44.22]You're on my team.
[117:45.60]You're okay.
[117:46.52]Okay, calm down here.
[117:48.30]Getting a little too freaked out.
[117:52.40]Again, the guy... I don't...
[118:04.76]I'm gonna put on acid base.
[118:06.20]Acid base will just distract me.
[118:20.03]We're down.
[118:24.73]Down.
[118:26.29]Red chest.
[118:26.99]I already have a good gun.
[118:28.41]I will protect somebody.
[118:30.35]We have a room full of people.
[118:31.21]It'll be fine.
[118:34.09]Jerma's flustered part cowboy.
[118:35.49]Yeah.
[118:39.22]Well, it stinks to die.
[118:40.74]When you're on a streak.
[118:50.06]When you have a really good gun, it's the worst.
[118:54.10]And, like, speaking of that.
[118:58.38]Speaking of, like, just dying.
[118:59.80]Speaking of dying.
[119:01.66]I walked through the metal detector and apparently I'm just gone.
[119:04.44]I don't want that one.
[119:18.65]Give me this thing.
[119:24.31]Dying really stinks, guys.
[119:25.45]Alright, get me out of here.
[119:33.75]I'm going here.
[119:34.35]I'm gonna change it up.
[119:44.02]Oh, I like this map.
[119:50.68]I like this place.
[120:01.97]Soft, soft, soft.
[120:08.24]Shit, this is like a four-team... This is a four-team shootout.
[120:11.14]Oh, God.
[120:14.92]Is that guy shooting from the grave?
[120:17.70]What?
[120:19.46]Four-team shootout.
[120:20.66]Oh, great.
[120:23.10]Actually, this might be fun because... Oh, it's chaotic.
[120:30.04]Play free-for-all.
[120:37.14]What did he have?
[120:37.56]He had a Colt maybe.
[120:40.49]Don't like the Colt.
[120:44.49]Didn't drop his gun.
[120:55.66]You had a better gun than I did.
[120:57.66]I'll take it.
[120:59.93]Shit.
[121:09.28]You're on my team.
[121:09.92]Come up here.
[121:10.26]We need to secure this room for sure, man.
[121:13.00]Come on, man.
[121:18.32]Ah, bad guy, bad guy, bad guy.
[121:26.03]Oh, fuck.
[121:28.29]Oh, you didn't see either of them.
[121:35.93]It's too chaotic.
[121:44.31]I gotta get out of this room.
[121:45.48]This is gonna cause ma- Dude!
[121:51.42]Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down!
[121:54.00]Down!
[121:56.10]Down!
[122:05.90]Put that cookie down!
[122:07.80]NOW!
[122:08.14]Let's get some music in here, why not?
[122:19.33]Damn it.
[122:22.25]Have they been updating this game?
[122:23.31]Yeah, I think so.
[122:26.94]That's called superior tracking.
[122:35.78]Damn it, that just started.
[122:42.14]You had so many spare guns.
[122:43.50]It's hard to not freak out when you're surrounded by enemies.
[122:47.99]Thank you, Amityar, for three months.
[122:50.81]They say heart.
[122:51.35]Well, heart to you.
[122:52.23]Thanks.
[122:54.03]Bugcatchervarms, thanks for four months.
[122:55.59]Believe in the me that believes in you.
[123:00.01]Well, thank you, Bugcatcher.
[123:02.81]Bo Beto of Bob Beto Chaps, thanks for the sub.
[123:05.21]Joe Fusho, 520 for three months.
[123:09.33]EggsOverEasyP, thanks for three months.
[123:11.97]Quarry80 for two months.
[123:13.05]Have you ever played Dungeon and Dragons?
[123:14.73]You should try playing with some other streamers.
[123:16.07]I played a short-lived campaign with Star, Ronnie, and Arcadum.
[123:24.80]Arcadum was the DM.
[123:26.22]It was pretty fun.
[123:27.74]We did it like once a week for like a month or two.
[123:33.03]80% accuracy.
[123:33.51]That's pretty good.
[123:35.25]Spartan Cupcake, thank you for the sub.
[123:39.59]And then on the bit front, we had 1,000 Bits by Katapugin.
[123:43.51]Patapugon, thank you for the $10, dude.
[123:45.11]Much appreciated.
[123:46.90]And then we had Todd gave $5, too.
[123:48.84]If you don't get a 10 kill streak this life, I'm never watching you again.
[123:51.82]Oh, God.
[123:52.36]Well, that didn't happen.
[123:53.28]No, it did.
[123:53.84]Yes, it did.
[123:55.06]That was like 15 minutes ago.
[123:56.02]That happened.
[123:57.34]I'm just going to pretend it did.
[123:58.16]Thanks, dude.
[123:59.77]Hoggle Boggle, thanks for the 500 bits.
[124:02.67]Try Vampire the Masquerade sometimes.
[124:06.21]I've actually heard that that game's fun and crazy.
[124:08.19]Maybe I'll give it a try.
[124:15.60]Seven eggs, thanks for the sub, dude.
[124:18.20]Did I even say?
[124:18.86]I might have already said that, but thanks, man.
[124:20.41]Alright, we're going to go back to Mirror's Leg and hate ourselves for doing it.
[124:28.13]Can I get good boy points or whatever?
[124:29.37]You can give me whatever you want.
[124:34.57]This is still four, man.
[124:45.18]Nine kills, don't be a fraud.
[124:46.48]Hey, nine... That's close enough.
[124:47.92]That's an A-.
[124:48.38]Oh...
[125:02.41]Play more Peggle.
[125:04.63]I'll play Peggle when Peggle 3 comes out.
[125:06.33]Let's do it.
[125:14.05]I killed that guy so bad he lost connection.
[125:21.62]Behind him.
[125:27.42]He doesn't even know.
[125:27.98]Doesn't even know.
[125:28.62]Double tap.
[125:30.00]Doesn't even know.
[125:34.66]And I'll take your gun.
[125:37.92]50% over weight, that's not good.
[125:41.32]I'm gonna throw one of these away.
[125:42.14]Did that guy just die?
[125:52.69]Uh, half credit, that's okay.
[125:54.79]I'll take half credit.
[125:57.25]Take the extra credit.
[125:58.43]Just like when I was in school.
[126:00.30]I would do extra work.
[126:02.02]That was a not smart move.
[126:03.34]Because no one knows I'm here.
[126:04.74]Whoop.
[126:27.67]Drunk.
[126:28.77]Drunk.
[126:29.35]Wow.
[126:30.51]I still managed to get him.
[126:32.28]That is a scary road if I had dynamite.
[126:41.16]Don't do it.
[126:42.04]Don't do it.
[126:42.48]What?
[126:42.77]Who did it?
[126:46.09]Oh, I got stuck on the fucking wall.
[126:49.17]Damn it.
[126:50.59]Damn it.
[127:02.79]What?
[127:05.63]Just enemies.
[127:06.15]Just enemies at every turn.
[127:09.88]Another bad guy!
[127:12.36]Another bad guy!
[127:13.22]Don't shoot me!
[127:14.06]God!
[127:16.50]Ugh, finally a friendly... Am I glad to see you, dude?
[127:21.82]I'm very glad to see you.
[127:31.37]Whiskey back here again?
[127:36.65]Don't shoot down here.
[127:38.45]Oh, get me out.
[127:39.61]It's too much.
[127:40.92]It's too many people.
[127:44.06]It's too...
[128:13.06]Coach gun.
[128:14.66]Hold on to this one.
[128:15.50]I think I'm overweight.
[128:22.67]I definitely am overweight.
[128:23.63]Something's gotta go.
[128:25.09]This thing.
[128:36.48]Don't reload it.
[128:37.18]I just need to hit somebody right in the face.
[128:40.04]No, reload it right now.
[128:49.83]Shoot!
[128:50.71]Shoot!
[129:01.29]Keep it up!
[129:04.29]Keep it up.
[129:05.67]Watch out for the guy down there.
[129:15.55]Nope.
[129:15.95]Too close.
[129:17.42]Watch out, man.
[129:17.86]There's a guy coming.
[129:18.90]I didn't even say that if a voice comes.
[129:20.04]Why did I just do that?
[129:23.54]Guy coming up right now.
[129:25.96]I got to turn the corner and blast him.
[129:30.32]Ah, there's nowhere to go.
[129:35.11]There was only a way to go.
[129:36.07]Open the train.
[129:48.52]Honest to God.
[129:54.58]Let's get back to the skull field.
[129:58.58]Right-handed.
[130:01.30]Right-handed.
[130:05.04]Up there in the points.
[130:05.82]Yeah, I'm up there in the points a little bit.
[130:12.98]Why do people... Honestly, why do people pick up the coach gun?
[130:17.71]That gun sucks so bad.
[130:26.79]The other three choices are so much better.
[130:28.29]At least in my personal opinion, I think.
[130:38.48]I'm stuck.
[130:41.07]He's hurt.
[130:42.71]The guy comes around the corner.
[130:44.13]Just whips a grenade.
[130:45.17]Supposed to be right-handed, by the way.
[130:49.11]What am I doing?
[131:00.13]Don't go up there until you reload.
[131:01.27]And get this guy.
[131:02.67]He's not even... Ah, he is looking over here.
[131:07.46]Tree snipe.
[131:12.86]Through the trees.
[131:16.02]Dermamoon.
[131:26.22]Just gonna run in circles.
[131:32.18]Eventually I'll find somebody to fight.
[131:34.78]There's a dust.
[131:43.68]He's gonna think I ran away.
[131:44.42]Nope.
[131:48.79]Then one of his friends is gonna come around the corner.
[132:00.28]I like this idea.
[132:01.28]Dramamoon.
[132:07.88]It's high moon.
[132:08.60]Yeah.
[132:09.64]It is high moon.
[132:11.70]Watch this.
[132:12.08]He's going to blow up next to me.
[132:12.98]Come on.
[132:14.16]Kill yourself with your own shit.
[132:15.14]Let's do the ambidextrous.
[132:26.27]No.
[132:26.69]That was stupid.
[132:28.91]Shouldn't have done that.
[132:32.25]Because charity in Germany is kind of cool, though.
[132:33.96]Thank you, uh...
[132:35.83]Archange.
[132:37.37]Archangel.
[132:39.53]Architect.
[132:40.57]Thanks for the 10 bucks, man.
[132:42.11]Thank you for putting charity in that as well.
[132:45.49]You are a fucking swell person.
[132:47.11]Thank you.
[132:47.77]Much appreciated.
[132:55.28]How long does the charity thing go for?
[132:56.42]Does anybody... Is it like...
[133:04.12]No, I'm staying.
[133:05.37]I'm staying.
[133:35.07]Remington, left-handed.
[133:37.07]You can do both, I think.
[133:39.54]Yeah, you can do bright-handed and left-handed.
[133:40.94]You need a star.
[133:42.28]Well, I don't know.
[133:50.12]Throw an insatiable.
[133:53.77]And I guess I can just do it.
[133:55.11]Who cares?
[133:55.51]I'm not going to pick the Derringer.
[133:57.47]No way.
[133:57.71]Alright, whatever.
[133:58.49]That's fine.
[134:00.45]Handgun throw.
[134:01.05]Okay.
[134:05.83]One more day.
[134:06.52]Okay.
[134:11.84]So you have to go tomorrow afternoon or something?
[134:14.26]Go double Derringer?
[134:15.20]No, I hate the Derringer.
[134:16.39]Derringer is really actually, no jokes aside, my least favorite weapon in the whole game.
[134:23.03]The two baby guns.
[134:25.84]I don't want to use them.
[134:35.73]Let's change it up in these close quarters.
[134:38.09]Wow.
[134:41.81]I almost killed us all.
[134:44.01]I almost killed us all.
[134:45.29]Why did I do that?
[134:46.52]Part of me just wanted to do that.
[134:48.56]I'm getting locked out.
[134:49.30]Shoot it!
[134:57.36]Oh, come on.
[135:00.76]Do it, do it, do it.
[135:04.88]Javelin YT with $1,515.
[135:07.80]Only one more day for charity, but I'll spend these now.
[135:09.54]Keep up the great work.
[135:10.18]Well, thanks, man.
[135:15.36]Thank you for the $15 and for adding the charity hashtag.
[135:20.37]How much have they raised total?
[135:21.21]That would have been cool if I took them all in.
[135:26.41]Fine.
[135:26.83]You guys want to do the shitty Derringers.
[135:28.57]Fine.
[135:28.97]I'll do it.
[135:31.01]Second Derringer, two Derringers.
[135:32.13]I'll do it.
[135:35.21]Ambidextrous.
[135:35.85]Those are two Derringers.
[135:39.15]Insatiable and Quickdraw.
[135:42.23]Okay.
[135:44.78]Watch me get like 20 kills in a row with these.
[135:46.86]I hate these little things.
[135:56.22]I don't like them, but I'll use them.
[136:03.19]Thank God I had a friend to help me kill that guy.
[136:07.35]double derringer dare the name of a youtube video double derringer dare and like somebody dares me to do it in like the voice comms fuck these two guns
[136:35.67]Oh, the Devil Derringer Dare!
[136:37.13]Hey, see you on YouTube!
[136:46.14]And it's my face.
[136:48.44]It's a picture of my face.
[136:50.96]With, like, a PogChamp mouth, like, looking like, Whoa!
[136:54.19]Derringers!
[136:56.33]Oh, jeez.
[136:56.75]Dane Tech.
[136:57.47]Four, seven, four, five, seventy-seven.
[137:00.19]Almost fifty fucking bucks.
[137:01.47]Only one more day for charity if I do this now.
[137:04.93]Thank you, Dane.
[137:08.77]Thank you for the $45.77.
[137:10.73]Legendary.
[137:18.51]Can I shoot simultaneously?
[137:19.69]Yeah, you can.
[137:20.57]I mean, you can go bang-bang.
[137:25.26]They're just too slow, and they don't do enough damage.
[137:28.98]But yeah, thank you once again, DaneTech.
[137:33.02]Another one of those guys that's given many, many amounts of dollars.
[137:35.56]45-45.
[137:42.80]Like, you see what I'm talking about there?
[137:46.62]Point blank, 45-45.
[137:48.79]And how long it takes to shoot them again.
[138:02.11]Gun sucks.
[138:10.73]No, I want to change guns, not leave the server.
[138:13.95]I'll go with the bow.
[138:17.05]I'm going with the bow.
[138:18.33]I tried.
[138:18.83]I can't do it.
[138:22.22]We haven't had any bow gameplay in a while.
[138:27.44]Got to go for headshots.
[138:28.36]Yeah, but it's just... I don't like the gun.
[138:30.58]I don't like it.
[138:40.32]It would help if you aim.
[138:43.10]Yeah, you know that.
[138:43.55]That would help.
[138:47.33]Come on.
[138:49.57]It was the exact amount of damage it would have taken to not have that guy die.
[138:52.23]I figured he was going to go that way.
[139:00.70]Go that way.
[139:01.50]Come on.
[139:01.82]Go that way.
[139:04.72]Dammit.
[139:07.70]two guys in there, huh?
[139:10.34]Got killed from behind.

[139:14.28]Am I of charity now?
[139:17.70]Thank you, Aeronorth, for the five bucks.
[139:20.92]You are charity now.
[139:27.15]Teach us how to make pancakes?
[139:28.17]It's really easy.
[139:32.65]You just gotta miss this guy.
[139:33.69]Then hit him in the head.
[139:34.93]Or in the back of his neck.
[139:39.08]Whatever area you have to hit the guy in to make him collapse in front of his face and not wake up.
[139:43.40]You would have thought that Fred would change his name by now.
[139:52.20]Not quite.
[139:54.88]Taking it just in case.
[139:58.70]I'm always Fred, don't you know?
[140:16.42]That would've been perfect Okay, thank you Aaron North God hundred bucks Thank you Aaron North much love dude Dropping a fucking hundred dollars

[141:41.68]Did he do it again?
[141:42.34]He did it again.
[141:43.63]He did it again.
[141:45.11]He said, bad.
[141:47.13]No.
[141:48.89]Oh my god, dude.
[141:52.65]No, I can't be bad.
[141:54.67]You gave me $200.
[141:56.33]Okay, hold on, Aeronorth.
[142:00.29]I gotta do something cool for Aeronorth.
[142:08.05]Thank you, Aronorth.
[142:09.07]Aronorth, like, oh, here's my benefactor.
[142:11.60]Aronorth.
[142:12.86]That's not a person.
[142:15.24]Get in here.
[142:22.19]The bow's hard to use.
[142:23.17]Come on, guys.
[142:24.05]It's not easy.
[142:29.90]You ready?
[142:31.64]I'm not ready because I don't even know where I'm getting shot from.
[142:34.94]Was that guy shooting me through three people?
[142:36.74]I don't know.
[142:39.94]I think he may have been.
[142:45.34]$200 joke.
[142:48.72]Well, he used charity, so there's... What is it?
[142:53.26]Every... No chance there.
[143:00.92]Alright, that's what I'm talking about.
[143:03.08]Turn it up.
[143:05.33]Pump up the fucking volume.
[143:13.13]I very clearly shot that guy in the fucking head.
[143:15.11]I'm not very happy right now.
[143:17.37]I'm going to have to turn the face cam on again.
[143:18.79]Alright, here you go.

[143:43.26]Hold on.
[143:44.46]Oh my god.
[143:45.22]Aeronorth has passed $1,000 total, by the way.
[143:51.86]One thousand dollars, Aranoth has passed it.
[143:55.19]That's fucking crazy, man.
[143:56.39]That's... I never... I've always said this shit, but I can never imagine that somebody... ...would want to give me that much money.
[144:04.33]Thank you fucking so much, man.
[144:07.02]Uh... And then... Urbo... Urbo... Ur... Ya boy Jack!
[144:11.80]I was gonna say Urbo Jack.
[144:13.50]Ya boy Jack Jerma, you're easily one of my favorite... ...content creators on the interwebs.
[144:17.55]Love everything you do, keep it up.
[144:21.23]Thanks, dude.

[144:29.12]You guys are too much.
[144:30.16]I gotta do something good.
[144:33.12]I have to do something good here.
[144:34.92]Hold on.
[144:35.32]We're going with the hatchet.
[144:37.58]I'll have more confidence there.
[144:41.27]Dude, at this rate, the clown car crash is gonna, like, happen anyways.
[144:45.81]I don't even need double zero.
[144:51.55]That would be awesome.
[144:53.31]No, I'm gonna get it and kill him.
[144:58.42]Uh, you boy Jack, thanks for the hundred bucks, man.
[145:00.80]Really.
[145:01.74]And then... He gave 45 bucks and put him over the edge.
[145:05.50]That's kind of cool.
[145:14.44]That wasn't worth $200, though.
[145:15.28]This is, though.
[145:15.96]This is.
[145:16.30]This one is.
[145:23.82]Clown car.
[145:25.48]Yeah, I'm gonna have to do it now.
[145:28.04]How much is a clown car?
[145:28.90]How much is like a motorized clown car?
[145:37.32]Just dynamite carries.
[145:38.88]This calls like mayhem right now.
[145:42.97]That's a... It has to be opened.
[145:53.23]Where is everybody?
[145:53.89]They just look like people right there.
[145:55.01]I'm not getting anyone.
[146:04.38]Well, whatever.
[146:04.84]It's going up there now.
[146:07.02]I don't think I got one person.
[146:16.47]I didn't get anybody with that.
[146:28.28]Oh, well.
[146:34.21]How am I still in sixth place?
[146:36.15]I've done absolutely nothing this whole game.
[146:52.02]That guy's got the shotgun.
[146:55.03]How many people have that?
[146:56.02]I feel like the whole team has the coach gun or the shotgun right now.
[146:59.84]Alright, fine.
[147:04.88]Damn it.
[147:07.18]Thank you to Paul Waffle for the 10 months.

[148:53.85]Thank you, Longshot, for the thousand bits.
[148:57.59]Hey, thanks for being a cool viewer, Longshot.
[148:59.18]I don't want to go back to that one.
[149:04.92]That's too many people.
[149:10.12]Guys, that's enough hearts.
[149:10.94]You can't let this clown video making machine feel human.
[149:15.61]You guys make me feel human every day, man.
[149:19.79]You guys keep me grounded.

[149:41.84]You're all cool viewers.
[149:42.58]You don't have to pay to get on the secret cool viewer list.
[149:52.06]Don't worry.

[149:56.00]You did good, Wongtan.
[149:56.84]Thank you.
[149:57.82]Thanks for the five bucks.
[150:00.12]Hitman?
[150:01.20]Last time I tried to play Hitman, it didn't work.
[150:04.77]The holiday episode.
[150:05.79]Holiday episode.
[150:06.85]I guess technically it is an episode.
[150:11.01]The holiday-themed map is maxing out my CPU.
[150:13.77]It's the only level in the whole game that was doing it for some crazy reason.
[150:22.98]There's a list?
[150:23.64]Yeah, you're all on it.
[150:26.99]It's a pretty big list.
[150:29.65]If you have opened this stream up and watched the stream, you're on that list.
[150:40.10]Why is there a sub-only room in Discord?
[150:42.62]That's a public Discord.
[150:43.56]This is a sub-only room.
[150:44.82]I don't know.
[150:47.86]It was highly requested.
[150:49.08]People wanted it.
[150:51.28]And I figured it's...
[150:53.20]You know, there's a general room.
[150:54.98]There's a stream room.
[150:55.80]There's a sub room.
[150:56.60]There's a lot of rooms there.
[150:58.16]There's a voice chat.
[150:58.82]You can go and like talk and shit.
[151:02.82]There's just one or two rooms that are sub only.
[151:07.82]I'm on the list.
[151:08.30]Yeah, you're on the list, man.
[151:09.28]That guy was so tunnel vision.
[151:15.37]Did I get that gun?
[151:16.87]No, I didn't.
[151:17.61]Oh, wait.
[151:18.07]You giving me this gun?
[151:21.43]I can't pick it up.
[151:23.41]It's in such a dumb spot.
[151:24.87]Watch out!
[151:25.37]Watch out behind you!
[151:30.81]Go get him!
[151:31.93]Get him!
[151:44.48]Any more?
[151:45.35]Reload!
[151:45.93]Ooh!
[151:48.49]Why did he still hit me?
[151:49.63]He hit me in the gun.
[151:54.79]He hit me in the gun.
[151:57.73]Give me this.
[151:58.25]Give me the Peacemaker.
[152:03.22]Not the Peacemaker.
[152:03.78]The Walker.
[152:06.80]Walker!
[152:07.24]Let's string it together again.
[152:10.36]Give me 10.
[152:18.38]God.
[152:19.94]I can't believe it.
[152:22.05]I knew someone was going to spawn behind me.
[152:23.83]I just, I checked like twice and it didn't matter.
[152:30.03]Oh well.
[152:33.99]Can't believe people with eyes are on the list.
[152:35.50]What if I don't have eyes and I can't watch?
[152:39.56]You can like listen.
[152:42.18]You know, it's... As long as you're like here.
[152:46.30]As long as you've like ever heard my voice.
[152:57.51]Wow.
[152:59.51]Yeah, let's string this together and then get spawned on behind and die.
[153:02.27]$46,529 has been raised so far.
[153:10.41]I just saw it.
[153:17.53]Wager dropping huge bucks.
[153:20.77]I'm, like, looking at the chat right now.
[153:21.85]Let's see if I can get this guy.
[153:23.83]I got him, like, right in his stomach.
[153:24.85]Nope.
[153:27.57]Uh, Wager, wait, I'm late.
[153:32.09]Thank you, Wager, and thank you for using the charity hashtag.
[153:37.32]Nearly $50,000.
[153:38.18]He's gonna go to Doctors Without Borders, so...
[153:42.70]And it's Twitch's putting that money up, by the way.
[153:45.90]What is it?
[153:46.20]For every thousand bits that somebody gives with that hashtag, they give, what, like $2 or $3 or something?
[153:53.77]It's like a certain percentage.
[153:54.75]I don't even know what the percentage is.
[153:56.33]I know it's there, though.
[153:59.35]So when you, let's just say, Wager, when you just gave that $100, that's like, what, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, like 20%.
[154:18.04]Geez, you suck.
[154:20.10]I was like looking at the chat, man.
[154:21.58]There's people dropping like real money.
[154:25.74]I want to make sure I fucking appreciate what they're doing.
[154:31.66]I don't care if I die three or four times in a row.
[154:33.66]People are fucking extremely generous.
[154:37.38]You gotta say hi, man.
[154:40.50]It's not all about the video games.
[154:42.03]If people are going to give you that much money, you better believe I'm going to make sure I know who it was.
[154:55.23]That's a shit show.
[155:02.06]Money stream.
[155:02.78]This is turning into a money stream.
[155:06.84]Oh, God.
[155:12.33]It's for a good... Well, here, like... Using that hashtag is for a good cause.
[155:19.03]Like, Carl, that's another hundred bucks.
[155:24.28]It's a good cause, but, like, don't, like... Don't feel like you have to give me $100 to give, like, 20% of it to charity.
[155:31.99]You know what I mean?
[155:35.09]I fucking extremely appreciate this, but... Like, don't feel that, like, did you have to... Like, oh, I have to give $100 so I can give money to charity.
[155:46.41]Like, don't feel like you have to give me the $100.
[155:48.02]You know what I'm saying?
[155:51.90]Regardless of all that, though, it's... X-Tenant gave, like, $20 too.

[158:12.60]I don't even honestly know what the hell is going on.
[158:21.47]If I didn't acknowledge it, I might have just been in first place at the end of this.
[158:24.33]Because I looked at it.
[158:25.99]It's not going to happen though.
[158:34.00]I just got baited.

[159:56.71]Tender Tacos with a fucking 100.
[160:00.35]And Sam with 500.

[160:07.31]We'll find out.
[160:08.21]But I'm going to get on that.
[160:10.79]The second this stream is over.
[160:13.39]In fact, I am now excited to do that.
[160:14.73]I can't wait to do that.
[160:17.36]Hope you guys are ready.
[160:19.02]Because at some point in the new year, you're going to get... I'm not even fucking going to tell you when it's going to happen either.
[160:25.36]I'm going to be playing a game.
[160:27.10]And all of a sudden, I'm going to crash a clown car.
[160:31.32]You guys are going to have no clue when it's going to happen.
[160:35.17]I could be playing like, I'm playing like Hitman.
[160:37.10]Oh, that was fun.
[160:37.86]Okay.
[160:38.16]And then instantly cut to me in a clown car, driving the clown car.
[160:40.82]And like with the middle finger out the window.
[160:45.51]I swear to God that's going to happen.
[160:49.01]I promise.
[160:53.68]I was still in third place.
[161:02.44]Do you have to be a sub to know the Discord info?
[161:04.18]No, it's public.
[161:05.54]Just type in a exclamation point Discord.
[161:07.90]You get the info.
[161:10.74]The Discord is completely 100% open to the public.
[161:12.98]There are certain rooms that are dedicated to subs.
[161:17.51]But the actual Discord is, you can just come in and chat with whoever you want.
[161:22.51]The same rules apply here that they do in the Discord.
[161:25.28]Oh, God.
[161:32.28]Just don't be crazy.
[161:33.92]You can have fun, but don't take it too far.
[161:35.82]That's all I ask.
[161:37.71]And I feel like you guys are smart enough to know what I mean by that, you know?
[161:42.87]That was just so bad.
[161:43.61]At least he got the coach gun, too.
[161:47.21]Filthy New Englander!
[161:48.19]Hey.
[161:53.56]New England's not so bad.
[161:54.61]Hey, New England's not so bad.
[161:57.31]It's just, we get like terrible shit weather.
[162:02.75]It's cold six months of the year.
[162:05.46]It's one of the most expensive states in the country to live.
[162:11.68]What are you talking about?
[162:13.06]I love New England.
[162:15.46]I love it here.

[162:47.44]Facecam?

[163:26.57]I'm okay with that.
[163:28.99]Came with a phase.
[163:29.57]I might actually be, like, a little sweaty right now.

[163:34.70]I have the kind of... Okay, when I, like, sweat, when I perspirate, it doesn't, like, smell.
[163:40.14]I just kind of get, like, a little wet.
[163:41.68]You know what I mean?
[163:42.94]Just a little bit.
[163:45.13]I just smell like, kind of like deodorant.
[163:46.47]Doesn't smell bad at all.
[163:54.49]Stupid, you fucking people.
[164:01.60]It's musky.
[164:03.44]You don't know what I smell like.
[164:04.82]You don't know.
[164:09.20]For all you know, I can smell like a bag of Doritos.
[164:16.21]Gotta get him in the head.

[165:41.82]Yeah, large Marge.

[173:29.70]I'm like 5'8".
[173:30.38]It's pretty average.
[173:32.54]I swear to God, I promise you.
[173:34.94]I'm not that short.

[173:48.99]What do you think?
[173:52.01]So should I just sit like there for the rest of the stream?
[173:53.47]What do you think?
[173:54.59]Just sit like this the whole time.
[173:57.86]Shorter than me.
[173:58.42]I'm 5'8".
[173:59.00]That's like, that's fucking average.
[174:00.90]That's very average.

[174:56.91]No servers are responding.
[174:58.63]Oh, no gun games.
[175:00.27]I got kicked out of my own gun game.
[175:03.55]Winter long.
[175:04.91]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[175:07.65]Gun game.
[175:08.41]Come on.
[175:09.83]19 and 20.
[175:09.99]I'm going to go to Space Jam.
[175:11.15]I don't want that 100 ping.
[175:18.78]Two foot five.
[175:23.30]I want a gun game.
[175:25.38]You go out on top.
[175:26.06]You go out as a champion.
[175:28.70]We'll play.
[175:29.37]How long are we going?
[175:29.93]Three hours or so?
[175:32.03]We'll go for another couple rounds probably.
[175:43.24]I resent that.
[175:43.84]I'm 5'3".
[175:45.48]I'm 5'8".
[175:47.74]Nothing wrong with being short.
[175:52.14]Do I dare go to Space Jam right now?
[175:54.90]Castle Knight?
[175:55.71]No.
[175:58.39]Go back to Cripple Creek.
[176:01.45]Go on Sp- I don't want to go on Space Jam.
[176:15.28]Try the bow again.
[176:18.50]Short people live longer.
[176:19.38]Is that true?
[176:24.58]Nice.
[176:27.10]511's not good.
[176:27.88]Look.
[176:28.14]511 is fine.
[176:30.46]Is there team damage?
[176:32.48]No.
[176:32.66]Okay, I thought I would just hit my own guy in the back.
[176:40.29]Like, I knew what it was like growing up short.
[176:43.57]It took me until I was like 17 to get taller than like 5'2".
[176:46.75]I had a late growth spurt.
[176:54.05]Oh, that was bad.
[176:58.61]Should have stood still.
[176:59.85]No, they'll take care of him.
[177:00.73]Just move.
[177:06.48]Ooh, I got him right in the butt.
[177:07.74]Right in his butt cheeks.
[177:08.80]That worked.
[177:12.02]I was like... I had to have been like 5'1 or 5'2 when I was like 16 or something.
[177:17.95]I was very, very small.
[177:21.97]And then I watched like Popeye and it made me want to eat spinach.
[177:24.95]And I grew like seven and a half inches.
[177:32.04]That makes it sound like something else.
[177:34.62]I ate spinach and grew seven and a half inches.
[177:43.56]I crack myself up sometimes.
[177:45.16]What a fucking dumb thing to say.
[177:52.04]Hail Mary.
[177:59.29]Below average?
[178:00.13]What?
[178:01.59]5'8 is the male height.
[178:04.41]The height of an average male.
[178:07.18]I'm average.
[178:09.08]Just your average Joe.
[178:22.00]That should have hit him.
[178:34.31]Woo-hoo!
[178:39.23]Damn it.
[178:39.69]The trajectory throws me off a lot.
[178:42.09]That guy.
[178:42.29]Downtown.
[178:43.05]Downtown.
[178:50.07]So dead.
[178:51.10]Yeah, I'm dead.
[178:52.06]Maybe not.
[178:53.10]I got backup.
[178:59.34]How tall is Star?
[179:00.41]Star, I believe he's like six something.
[179:04.53]He's at least like six feet, I think.
[179:15.27]I think I hit him, and it was... He got hit by two blows at the same time.
[179:21.99]Get in the water, you fucking dirtball!
[179:25.77]You filthy fucking animal!
[179:35.48]Second place, by a lot.
[179:40.93]Just accidentally killed that guy.
[179:45.09]It's full of frags.
[179:46.07]Game of the century.
[179:47.23]I love this game.
[179:53.96]This is where I want to be.
[179:55.44]Up here.
[179:58.32]Huh?
[180:01.68]Huh?
[180:04.64]Snuck that arrow right there, but there's another guy.
[180:13.68]Bastards!
[180:17.22]5'10 is average in the US.
[180:18.46]Sorry, Jeremy, you're a dwarf.
[180:19.82]No!
[180:20.68]I wasn't talking about US.
[180:22.20]I was talking about world.
[180:24.43]Find me the average in the entire world.
[180:25.91]5'8 is average in the fucking world.
[180:32.97]Somebody just threw a grenade in here.
[180:34.13]Give me back my bow.
[180:37.67]I'm dead.
[180:40.39]I'm not.
[180:54.06]In the world.
[180:55.12]What's the average in the whole world?
[180:56.88]I want to know.
[180:58.24]5'8 average in Dwarfland.
[181:02.73]No.
[181:03.47]You guys don't even know what it's like to be short.
[181:07.23]Oh, you tall guys.
[181:08.41]You can reach the top shelf.
[181:09.77]Wow.
[181:10.77]Cool.
[181:13.43]Oh, look at how tall and handsome he is.
[181:16.71]Bullshit.
[181:21.32]Oh, he's so tall.
[181:22.40]Have you seen the size of my arms?
[181:28.92]I was gonna say something terrible right there, but I didn't.
[181:38.42]Ooh.
[181:40.43]I'll get him.
[181:42.11]Get out of the way.
[181:43.39]Get out of the fucking way.
[181:44.77]Get out of the way.
[181:49.71]You are making this real difficult for me.
[181:55.11]You're in big trouble.
[182:00.01]5'8 is the average in Ironforge.
[182:15.55]That's not even true.
[182:16.39]It's like three feet tall.
[182:18.51]Headshot.
[182:24.17]Get the bow out of here.
[182:34.30]That would be a huge dwarf.
[182:36.36]Come on.
[182:37.12]Give me at least a little bit of credit there.
[182:38.60]Follow the train.
[182:44.86]Pot of gold on face skin.
[182:46.26]5'8 is an average.
[182:49.74]What is it in the world?
[182:51.53]I asked someone to look it up and I've yet to hear what the average height of the whole world is.
[182:56.63]It's probably like five, like six.
[183:05.31]Whatever, five, eight.
[183:07.81]I'd pull off a mean, pull off a mean headlock.
[183:11.09]Like this.
[183:19.43]5'11".
[183:19.87]It's not the world type... type... No.
[183:22.09]I don't believe that for a second.
[183:25.09]It's like 5'7".
[183:33.36]Torbjörn is not 5'8".
[183:35.66]Torbjörn is at... at the highest.
[183:38.56]Two and a half feet off the ground.
[183:40.18]Ground.
[183:40.86]Ground.
[183:47.59]Whatever.
[183:48.39]Hey, it's not how tall you are.
[183:52.14]Hey, it ain't the size of the... It ain't the size of the current.
[183:56.82]It's how many fish can swim inside of it.
[184:02.74]It ain't the size of the fucking ocean.
[184:05.64]It's how much motion is in that ocean.
[184:07.70]What is it?
[184:08.22]Somebody do it.
[184:08.80]Somebody make it.
[184:09.42]Make that joke for me.
[184:11.93]Yeah, it's not about how big the ocean is.
[184:13.65]It's about how many fish you can fit in the ocean.
[184:17.05]Which means it's about how big the ocean is, so that I just completely contradicted the word, what I was just saying.
[184:23.51]You're right, 5'8", average worldwide.
[184:25.93]Yeah.
[184:26.85]That's what I... Thank you, NoNameBob.
[184:29.43]Thank you.
[184:31.88]Look, you know, it ain't the size of the screw.
[184:39.76]It's the kind of drill you use.
[184:53.85]It ain't the size of the screw.
[184:56.17]It's how hard you drill.
[184:58.17]Okay, I'm done with that.
[185:10.46]That's it.
[185:10.74]That is PG-13.
[185:11.02]I didn't say anything bad.
[185:22.59]I'm talking about tools.
[185:23.67]Tools!
[185:24.03]We're talking about tools, guys.
[185:27.01]Turn on this guy.
[185:27.55]Where is he?
[185:28.74]Yeah, get turned on.
[185:30.92]Oh, throw the... Whip the fucking gun at him.
[185:33.30]No, I don't even have that.
[185:34.46]I'm okay.
[185:34.68]I'll be fine.
[185:35.40]Don't worry.
[185:44.25]5'2", world average.
[185:45.69]Women are average 5'8".
[185:46.85]No, they are not.
[185:48.99]Women are average like 5'5".
[185:49.87]Or like 5'4".
[185:57.04]5'8 is not the female average.
[186:02.89]That's getting me riled up right now.
[186:04.85]When I get riled up, that's when I get in first place.
[186:08.25]I'm the only tool hay.
[186:10.11]Easy.
[186:11.85]Easy.
[186:12.27]You're fishing for a perma-ban.
[186:13.54]I don't think you want to be in a permanent fucking ban here.
[186:19.84]That's a 10 second ban.
[186:29.08]You know, we talk about the hard topics in this chat, don't we?
[186:34.20]Yeah, we talk about, like... We're on, like, a pretty good topic right now.
[186:37.74]Here's the current topic.
[186:38.58]You know, we... You know, we've talked about... We've talked about Donald Trump.
[186:42.48]We've talked about, like, Hillary Clinton.
[186:45.18]The real... The tough issues here.
[186:48.22]We talk about, like, Christmas.
[186:49.46]How was your Christmas?
[186:51.94]You know, another very important... You're tiny!
[186:54.94]You're fucking tiny, Jerma.
[186:56.72]We talk about the real issues.
[187:08.94]I'm not tiny.
[187:11.14]Listen.
[187:11.82]I'll give you this.
[187:12.22]I'm not tiny.
[187:14.02]I'm compact.
[187:16.94]Huh?
[187:17.82]Can you give me that?
[187:18.32]Can you guys give me that?
[187:20.22]I'm not tiny.
[187:20.76]I'm compact.
[187:26.44]Like, when I take a shower and I'm out of the shower and I'm looking at myself in the full body mirror that I have.
[187:32.73]And I just, like, start fucking flexing and, like, squeezing my, like, butt cheeks together.
[187:36.71]I go, damn, that guy's compact.
[187:43.94]I'm really digging myself a fucking pretty large grave here, aren't I?
[188:01.03]You tell me I missed that guy, I'll give you a dollar.
[188:06.84]A germadollar.
[188:07.60]A Jerma Buck.
[188:08.42]A fake one.
[188:09.14]You get a fake dollar.
[188:13.16]False eyes hand mirror.
[188:16.86]Hey, what do you know?
[188:18.82]What do you know?
[188:28.00]Third place.
[188:28.96]Third place.
[188:29.58]42% accuracy, guys.
[188:30.48]That's pretty great.
[188:35.69]Quit this topic while you're still ahead.
[188:38.89]I don't care.
[188:39.23]I'm just having fun.
[188:42.44]At least I'll fit in that clown car, right guys?
[188:45.00]Huh.
[188:50.21]Term is height.
[188:51.09]No, I don't care.
[188:52.39]I know that I'm like small.
[188:53.45]I don't care.
[189:00.89]I got more important things to worry about than if I'm not like 5'9 rather than 5'8.
[189:08.29]Like how do I get a pair of pants that's gonna fit this thing?
[189:14.36]Alright, that's it.
[189:15.54]I'm done.
[189:16.56]I'm done.
[189:17.06]No more jokes like that.
[189:18.68]I'm done.
[189:19.30]That's not what we're doing.
[189:21.92]We're not doing that anymore.
[189:23.56]And I meant like pockets because I have a big iPhone.
[189:25.68]I have one of those iPhone 6 Pluses and it's just huge and I need a pair of pants to fit it.
[189:31.97]Don't get your mind out of the gutter, guys.
[189:33.29]Come on.
[189:45.91]I told you, it was an iPhone.
[189:46.81]I have an iPhone 6 Plus, and it's huge.
[189:50.75]Oh!
[189:53.27]Found that crotch cam.
[189:57.61]No, we don't have a crotch cam.
[189:59.80]You can't make it.
[190:03.70]What's the map's name?
[190:04.98]Uh, I actually don't know.
[190:05.72]I don't remember.
[190:06.62]I've played on these maps like a thousand times, and I still don't know what they are.
[190:19.43]I would have got that guy, too.
[190:24.02]What?
[190:24.14]What size shoe am I?
[190:25.06]What?
[190:28.04]I shop at the women's footlocker?
[190:31.44]What size shoe am I?
[190:32.36]What do you think?
[190:33.00]What do you guys think?
[190:36.92]You guys are so concerned about this.
[190:39.97]Everybody's so concerned.
[190:52.46]Four?
[190:55.20]Not, nope.
[190:57.06]Four, four, four.
[190:58.42]Okay, you guys realize like a size three or a four.
[191:00.70]Those are like baby shoes.
[191:05.29]You guys think I have baby shoes?
[191:07.97]All I see is like toddler shoes.
[191:09.55]Like, oh, I have two.
[191:13.73]Nine and a half, nine and a half.
[191:16.69]You guys are getting close.
[191:24.39]Size 10.
[191:24.99]You're right.
[191:25.75]People can see it.
[191:28.37]10.
[191:28.45]Size 10.
[191:33.69]Fuck!
[191:34.27]That would have been perfect.
[191:35.29]That would have been amazing.
[191:37.67]Baby shoes.
[191:39.39]What if I just showed the camera down there and it was just these tiny little baby feet?
[191:46.01]These little itsy bitsy little baby shoes.
[191:49.26]Like little sneakers.
[191:55.37]That small- 10 is not small.
[191:56.59]I'm like too busy looking at this chat.
[192:08.02]10 is- 10 is not small!
[192:21.52]10 or 11 is like... that's... like... that's like... that's like what people buy for shoes is like... 9 and a half to like 11 and a half.
[192:38.87]I need to get somebody with this long range and they'll be happy.
[192:43.01]I just want to be happy.

[194:43.61]Thank you also for 10 bucks from NoNameBob.
[194:46.07]How do you carry your iPhone?
[194:46.99]I already answered that question.
[194:48.07]I got big hands.
[194:48.93]My hands are big.
[194:51.87]Never Trust a Purple gave 10 bucks earlier, about a few minutes ago.
[194:57.61]Just compacted them into a thousand.
[194:59.39]I had a hundred thousand.
[195:00.67]It's compact.
[195:03.31]Average height for men is eight feet tall.
[195:04.73]Says no name bought for 10 bucks.
[195:05.87]Thanks a lot, dude.
[195:06.47]Sorry, Jerma.
[195:08.09]That's not true.
[195:10.46]Tiny streamer throws fit on stream.
[195:14.54]I'm fine.
[195:16.25]You hear the sound of my voice?
[195:17.11]I'm very relaxed.
[195:18.73]Not upset at all.
[195:20.15]I could be upset.
[195:20.75]You guys want me to get upset?
[195:21.56]I can.
[195:22.96]But why?
[195:23.38]It's the holidays.
[195:24.22]New Year's is coming up.
[195:24.98]There's a lot to be celebrating for.
[195:27.16]Why would I get angry?
[195:29.14]Stay positive.
[195:31.68]I am not five fucking feet tall.
[195:36.58]You knew that was coming, and it was not even funny.
[195:38.74]But thank you, No Name Bob, for the thousand bucks.
[195:40.70]Thousand bucks.
[195:43.36]Thousand bits.
[195:44.02]Thanks for the thousand bucks.
[195:49.67]Thank you also to Sam for the five bucks as well earlier.
[195:57.83]Magpie, thanks for the three bucks.
[195:59.02]How's it going, Jermbo?
[195:59.96]Thanks.
[196:00.80]I'm going good.
[196:01.64]Hopefully you're going good too.
[196:03.38]Hopefully you're going good too.
[196:05.38]Baby needs his bottle.
[196:09.23]You guys are fucking awesome.
[196:10.95]Piper also gave 400 bits.
[196:12.99]Hope this comment comes through, but just wanted to know that you're the only streamer and YouTuber who's consistently made me laugh.
[196:18.19]No matter what mood I'm in.
[196:19.03]And for that, I thank you.
[196:20.13]And hashtag charity.
[196:22.25]Well, thanks for being around here, Piper.
[196:23.27]I'm glad you're enjoying the streams and the videos and stuff.
[196:27.31]That makes me happy.
[196:28.83]So, welcome.
[196:29.27]Thanks.
[196:32.65]Let's go.
[196:33.79]Let's do some more.
[196:34.31]Thanks a lot, guys.
[196:36.38]Inky had a 10-month sub right there a minute or two ago.
[196:40.95]Jesus.
[196:41.29]How have I not been kicked?
[196:44.09]I don't know.
[196:47.69]I don't know.
[196:48.77]Isn't that a video where the guy goes, I don't know.
[196:59.36]Watch this.
[197:00.70]Watch this.
[197:01.64]Keep your eyes on the prize, guys.
[197:13.85]Why wasn't it doing anything?
[197:14.91]Alright, give me this.
[197:28.50]I'm playing.
[197:29.24]Let's play for real.
[197:30.58]Put on the Remington.
[197:31.30]Left-handed.
[197:32.41]Quick draw.
[197:33.53]Go.
[197:48.10]Let's go into the bank.
[197:49.18]See if I can get the... That guy was just attached to my body.
[197:55.02]That guy was glued to me.
[198:05.18]You guys, get out of here.
[198:06.16]You guys are like fucking bees.
[198:09.62]Leave my picnic alone.
[198:19.26]Gotta get in the bank and be alive and get the box.
[198:27.53]It's never fair when there's three.
[198:28.95]Where are my three friends?
[198:29.79]Am I going to be playing the new Binding of Isles?
[198:34.29]Actually, I heard about that.
[198:35.39]There was like a huge community content pack or something.
[198:40.58]I might have to give that a perusing.
[198:44.60]Because it adds a ton of stuff, doesn't it?
[198:51.82]Such an eternity.
[199:00.38]It's not where I want to be.
[199:03.76]Got sniped.
[199:06.01]Play it?
[199:06.31]Yeah, I'll do it.
[199:08.15]Sounds like fun.
[199:10.65]Oh, where's my team?
[199:11.91]I forgot.
[199:12.27]That's me being a streamer.
[199:20.68]God, where is this guy?
[199:23.36]Where's my fucking teammate, dude?
[199:37.70]They just switched places.
[199:38.50]That just freaked me the fuck out.
[199:40.34]One of them died and they switched places.
[199:45.44]My legs were just up in the air.
[199:48.54]That was so weird.
[199:49.52]What the hell am I doing?
[200:00.70]How did I get hit from fucking behind?
[200:02.18]How did I get shot from behind?
[200:05.96]That's it.
[200:07.98]Taking an equalizer.
[200:11.86]I'd like to pick this up.
[200:14.88]Can I, please?
[200:24.11]Fuck off.
[200:29.55]780 no scope?
[200:30.33]Sure.
[200:34.21]Joke.
[200:34.57]That wasn't a joke.
[200:35.27]I just was losing.
[200:42.53]He's not dead.
[200:43.75]What's 48 plus 74?
[200:44.55]Somebody do the math right now.
[200:47.59]48 plus 74?
[200:49.83]What happened?
[200:51.51]That's like 120 health.
[200:52.65]Huh?
[201:04.05]Pick it up for the love of God.
[201:16.04]Where is he?
[201:18.14]Where is this guy?
[201:19.84]Where is this guy?
[201:24.80]I don't see a person in any anywhere.
[201:30.57]Where was he?
[201:34.05]Now I'm just getting upset.
[201:53.90]It's 110.
[201:55.49]I'm fun-sized, yeah.
[201:56.27]That's what I thought.
[201:57.85]He was in the skylight?
[202:00.17]How?
[202:00.65]He was in the skylight?
[202:04.58]I'm way too far away to try to shoot this guy.
[202:06.26]I'm going to kick him over the edge.
[202:08.10]That would have been fun, but you know.
[202:23.01]That would have been nice.
[202:24.23]And someone behind me too.
[202:32.53]Keybind-less for a while.
[202:35.02]How dare you.
[202:38.82]How dare you bring up World of Warcraft after knowing how bad my Karazhan stream was.
[202:53.37]I'm old?
[202:54.75]Yeah, I know.
[202:56.53]I never said I was young.
[202:57.41]I don't think I was ever on being quoted as saying that I was young.
[203:19.23]Get the guy with the rifle.
[203:20.41]Get the guy with the rifle before he kills us all.
[203:22.33]50% overweight.
[203:27.65]Get rid of this dumb thing.
[203:30.88]Did what?
[203:31.44]Are you throwing me guns?
[203:32.22]What happened?
[203:34.60]What?
[203:35.06]What?
[203:36.30]What just happened?
[203:36.78]What happened to the sniper rifle?
[203:38.26]Who the fuck are you?
[203:40.56]What happened to the sniper rifle?
[203:41.72]Did I?
[203:42.18]What?
[203:43.10]Did I throw the sniper rifle?
[203:45.70]I don't think I did.
[203:48.86]I'm so confused right now.
[203:51.38]Did I throw the game?
[203:54.02]Did I?
[203:54.94]I think I threw it.
[203:58.90]I'm so fucking confused.
[204:02.23]Hey!
[204:07.83]Alright, I think I might clean it up a little.
[204:11.02]I'm gonna go take a bath.
[204:17.66]I'm gonna go take a fucking bath, man, with, like, bubble baths and shit.
[204:23.68]I'm gonna do, like, Abraham Lincoln on my chin and stuff with the bubbles.
[204:26.62]It's gonna be great.
[204:36.71]I'm going to do Colonel Sanders, Abraham Lincoln, Martin Van Brugge.
[204:41.05]That guy killed me from the eyes in the back of his head.
[204:54.31]Stream my back.
[204:55.15]I don't think that's allowed on Twitch IRL, unfortunately.
[204:58.67]I don't think I'd get away with that.
[205:08.40]I knew he was standing still and I just expected him to move to the right.
[205:10.90]But no.
[205:12.14]I'm just a baddie.
[205:19.42]Oh, I can't wait to just get in that bath.
[205:21.33]Are there like 150 people on blue right now?
[205:40.77]As long as I'm eating something.
[205:41.71]Yeah, I'll have like a molded cello.
[205:45.58]Let's hide.
[205:52.82]That's not going to work.
[206:01.04]I had my hair cut today.
[206:01.84]You guess somebody said gray hair.
[206:04.26]No gray hairs yet.
[206:08.61]Before I turn the stream up, you'll see.
[206:10.57]No gray hairs.
[206:11.51]You can examine my head.
[206:14.72]I am in the... Hold on.
[206:22.82]That guy just didn't fall off.
[206:25.26]That son of a bitch didn't fall off.
[206:28.46]And then he punched me twice and the guy shot me with a hand cannon from across the map.
[206:40.77]See, now he thought... Every time, there's always somebody just right fucking behind me!
[207:03.28]Finally a team.
[207:04.04]Let's like, stay together.
[207:13.08]Watch your language.
[207:13.76]That son of a bitch is one of your viewers.
[207:19.27]Well, he shot me.
[207:20.77]Of course I'm going to be like, hey, don't shoot me, dude.
[207:23.05]Of course I'm going to call him the son of a beast.
[207:33.94]Nope.
[207:38.34]Jerma is 5-2, LOL.
[207:40.02]Just killed me from behind.
[207:40.98]I was about to get very upset about that.
[207:53.19]No, we're doing positive only.
[207:55.01]Positive vibes only, right?
[208:07.29]I have a feeling I'm being, what's that word again?
[208:10.11]Targeted.
[208:10.69]Anybody have a feeling that that's possible right now?
[208:18.44]There's a slight chance.
[208:22.28]And it's only a slight chance.
[208:24.78]I'm going to say like 8%.
[208:25.38]I'm not going to give it the full 20 or 30%.
[208:36.09]He ain't gonna shoot me now.
[208:36.95]I'm going this way.
[208:43.23]He's waiting for me to come across.
[208:44.39]Yeah, I knew it.
[208:46.13]I knew it.
[208:46.83]He was waiting for me to step forward.
[208:50.90]I'm about to rage quit.
[208:51.64]I'm about to rage quit and go somewhere else.
[209:03.18]What?! !
[209:06.46]I was trying to, like, embarrass him.
[209:08.72]And I got embarrassed.
[209:09.54]Fuck that place.
[209:28.25]Oh, this one ended too.
[209:36.89]The old song.
[209:39.37]He was just trying to shoot me with the sniper rifle.
[209:43.94]That's how it worked.
[209:48.00]He would just, he would like see where I was in the stream and go like... Like where is he?
[209:51.58]Like on his fucking computer.
[209:52.82]He's like typing really fast and putting in his console key command.
[209:56.70]That's what happened.
[209:59.64]He's like the Jerma tracker.
[210:00.68]He's like, it's like... Oh, there he is.
[210:02.24]Okay.
[210:02.42]Get him.
[210:10.28]I was like, I think Jerma's coming this way.
[210:11.44]I saw him over here.
[210:12.18]Hold on a second.
[210:13.47]There he is.
[210:13.79]He's hiding right there.
[210:14.31]Get him.
[210:15.61]Two points.
[210:24.79]Let's go.
[210:35.52]Jerma tracker for Christmas.
[210:39.45]It's like Santa.
[210:40.31]It's like Santa.
[210:41.17]Ah, that would have been good.
[210:49.97]I need one hit, but so does he.
[210:57.40]Who's going to reload faster?
[210:58.46]I don't know.
[210:59.06]It was me, but he's got a friend.
[211:06.06]Jerma tracker locks onto shorties.
[211:09.28]Hey, whatever.
[211:30.89]Run away!
[211:39.01]Where did those two come from?
[211:46.08]You two came out of nowhere.
[211:52.06]You gotta get in this bell tower.
[211:53.67]That's where the box is.
[211:59.25]Watch out for that.
[212:07.78]Guy over there across the way.
[212:10.16]I got him like right in the head.
[212:10.98]Just hoping for like a lucky shot right in the face.
[212:19.81]What is it?
[212:20.05]College for communication?
[212:21.05]I did.
[212:23.19]What the hell is going on there?
[212:25.19]Why is it not exploding?
[212:29.73]Film, TV, and radio.
[212:37.99]I love how that's now going to be a thing.
[212:39.47]Someone just asked in the chat if I actually am 5'3".
[212:42.49]Wait, hold on.
[212:42.95]Is he?
[212:44.51]Damn it.
[212:49.26]God damn it.
[212:50.84]Don't kill me.
[212:51.72]I'll be very mad at you, sir.
[213:07.41]Thank God those are teammates.
[213:08.23]I would have just freaked out if they weren't.
[213:11.65]Star is tall.
[213:12.05]Yeah, Star is tall.
[213:12.57]Let me buy a very large margin.
[213:14.49]Star is like silver six feet tall.
[213:27.94]I got your back.
[213:31.76]Shit, he kicked him all the way down there.
[213:33.66]Sorry, dude.
[213:34.60]I came too late.
[213:37.36]I tried.
[213:41.70]Get off the roof.
[213:44.60]God!
[213:49.38]Now where'd it go?
[213:59.29]How come I die in one hit in the face?
[214:04.03]It's not fair.
[214:12.94]I can pull this out and be in first place, I think.
[214:15.58]If I'm good enough, I can.
[214:16.74]Let's see if I'm good enough.
[214:27.12]Do you remember the stallion?
[214:42.12]Tiny angry streamer.
[214:45.92]Thanks, tiny angry streamer.
[214:47.34]What's your stream?
[214:50.83]He's obviously... What the fuck?
[214:57.89]Are you kidding me?
[214:59.91]Dude, that guy shot it like five times.
[215:03.06]Point blank.
[215:04.86]There's no goddamn way.
[215:09.90]Sometimes, man, I wonder...
[215:12.97]How the fuck... that's even possible?
[215:18.19]He just came out of nowhere.
[215:33.90]Where... where... He's hiding behind the fucking... boat.
[215:43.25]Alright, here comes the train.
[215:44.49]It's already gone.
[216:00.54]You do... ...Oreo story?
[216:04.86]That was me.
[216:05.50]I wasn't stream sniping.
[216:06.52]Oh, yeah, right!
[216:10.83]Let's see, Varelix now, Varelix now saying, oh shit, hold on, he knows about the tracker that I have implanted into his computer.
[216:17.17]He knew I found out about it.
[216:19.78]He's like, oh shit, he knows.
[216:21.16]He knows that I have, like, the planter on him.
[216:26.84]See, like, we all just went spectate and went to his, like, thing, and he turned it off.
[216:30.94]He was like, oh shit, I gotta turn it off.
[216:33.22]No, come back.
[216:34.64]No.
[216:39.07]I'm just kidding with you man, don't worry.
[216:41.15]I thought that guy was on my team!
[216:52.34]But thanks for the 1500 man, appreciate it.
[216:59.92]Honestly, that just gave me an excuse to make computer noises with my mouth.
[217:05.00]Nothing to do with you.
[217:11.75]Get rid of this fucking gun.
[217:17.89]Like, I seriously... Honest to God, man.
[217:21.86]Did I not have left-handed selected?
[217:23.22]Because I had to throw the other gun down to switch the hands.
[217:26.22]Let me, like, triple-check that that's selected.
[217:30.10]Because F that.
[217:32.56]That was fucking stupid.
[217:38.37]What?
[217:39.33]That guy's got a rifle.
[217:40.57]That guy's got a rifle.
[217:41.29]Run.
[217:47.78]Blame the gun.
[217:48.30]No, I'm blaming myself for not having left-handed selected.
[217:51.22]I'm not blaming the gun.
[217:52.32]I said, what the F?
[217:54.16]I wanted the right thing selected.
[217:56.14]Apparently, it wasn't selected.
[217:57.61]You know what I'm saying?
[217:58.97]Are you saying that?
[218:00.69]I keep thinking that's a guy shooting me or stabbing me.
[218:07.76]Okay, dead.
[218:09.32]It's moving my camera.
[218:18.53]Alright, let's get up to the belfry, right?
[218:26.73]Let's get the yellow.
[218:28.59]Shit, where's that guy shooting from across the way?
[218:35.16]Do they have the sharps rifle?
[218:49.39]This gun is not going to work from this far away.
[218:52.75]No, this gun is not.
[218:53.77]I don't even know why I'm trying to shoot a guy with a sharps rifle.
[218:56.69]That was such a mistake.
[219:06.36]This is going to be the last round.
[219:07.62]I need to go take a bath.
[219:08.52]There's shit in my bath.
[219:11.24]I don't need to go there anymore.
[219:19.31]Ah, did you get him?
[219:19.87]He's gonna go in my bath.
[219:27.64]Fill the water up.
[219:28.58]And just, who cares?
[219:29.36]Whatever happens, happens, you know?
[219:40.71]He just, he ricocheted that up with one.
[219:42.57]He killed him.
[219:49.09]Yeah.
[219:50.77]I'm gonna go shit in my bath and, like, blame it on somebody else.
[219:56.19]Even though I live alone.
[219:57.09]Okay, I'm gonna shit in my bath, like, get out, wait, like, two or three minutes, walk in and be like, Hey!
[220:06.27]Who fucking did that?
[220:08.09]To no one.
[220:09.71]What is that even, what am I even talking about?
[220:10.97]And then I'm gonna have to just clean it up.
[220:13.55]No, I'm not doing that.
[220:14.29]Why would I do something like that?
[220:29.01]I didn't have to reload that guy's dead so close to be in the first place though after all this they're all sitting done I don't want that one hit on that guy are you okay I'm okay
[221:08.31]Nine minutes left.
[221:11.81]Can I stay in first?
[221:13.85]He's coming in.
[221:22.46]That guy lagged.
[221:25.48]That was lag.
[221:26.20]You saw it lag.
[221:27.34]You saw it.
[221:29.46]My mind's slowly deteriorating.
[221:31.78]No, it's not.
[221:33.76]I'm just messing around.
[221:34.36]I'm just having fun.
[221:38.62]I mean, I'm fine.
[221:39.62]But if I'm not in first place by the end of this, then I will deteriorate.
[221:44.18]You will see deterioration.
[221:47.60]Deterioration?
[221:49.22]Deteriorating.
[221:50.48]Place it there.
[222:00.66]They're everywhere.
[222:01.30]This stream has been hilarious?
[222:07.33]Well... I'm happy you think so, man.
[222:12.37]As long as you guys are having a good time, I'm having a good time.
[222:14.87]And as long as I'm having a good time, then I'm having a good time.
[222:19.90]You guys both died within one second.
[222:28.32]Are they in the bell tower?
[222:37.23]Hit every shot.
[222:38.55]Give me some credit there.
[222:39.23]Come on.
[222:40.47]Watch out behind you.
[222:47.24]Behind us, behind us, behind us.
[222:51.10]Hey, quit.
[222:51.56]Stop focusing on punching me and punch the bad guys.
[222:58.79]There are bad guys over here.
[223:05.17]Punching me is not the solution.
[223:20.21]The solution is other team fighting.
[223:21.71]Should I go for it?
[223:26.14]Should I go for it?
[223:30.04]I'll go for it.
[223:30.56]I'm going to die.
[223:33.76]I'm going to get shot right in the face.
[223:35.68]Three, two, one.
[223:38.69]Wow.
[223:39.65]Apparently not.
[223:44.74]Gotta get far away with this thing.
[223:48.40]Please, there's nobody up here, right?
[223:49.82]There is!
[223:51.24]There is!
[223:51.42]We're good.
[224:11.82]Oh, I almost got over the head.
[224:12.90]That would have been good.
[224:14.78]Watch out behind you.
[224:18.54]This is dangerous.
[224:19.10]I gotta move.
[224:21.68]This is very dangerous.
[224:24.94]Shit.
[224:28.47]Damn it.
[224:29.21]I knew I should have moved.
[224:30.43]They all were like, that guy's sniping up there.
[224:31.95]I should have moved when I had the chance.
[224:38.74]Get this guy on a team.
[224:41.06]I'll get the short guy on a team.
[224:43.30]No.
[224:50.04]Anybody pick that rifle up?
[224:50.96]Where is it?
[224:51.58]No.
[224:54.96]No.
[224:57.15]That guy seriously did not even know he died.
[225:01.35]He just was going up a stair.
[225:03.43]He was going up a ladder and died.
[225:10.86]Well, I had a shot.
[225:12.30]I was going to go for it.
[225:16.26]Speaking of going for it.
[225:17.89]No, they're going to get it.
[225:19.07]Let the other teammates get the guns, right?
[225:23.35]Spread the joy.
[225:37.38]Strength in numbers.
[225:38.04]Get up there.
[225:43.85]One shot, one shot, one shot, one kill.
[225:50.82]What a fucking fail.
[225:51.92]Just blew it so bad.
[226:02.93]Failure.
[226:05.67]Whoa.
[226:06.83]Watch your language.
[226:07.67]Let's go up.
[226:13.74]What's that?
[226:16.04]I'll take it.
[226:26.20]Show your face one more time.
[226:28.22]I guarantee I get him.
[226:31.06]Oh, I wanted to sneak up on that guy.
[226:45.24]Not do like 99 damage to him.
[226:52.83]Three minutes.
[226:53.29]I got to turn it on.
[226:53.97]I don't want to lose first place.
[227:03.23]Losing first place would not be a good thing.
[227:06.23]Stay with it, Jeremy.
[227:07.99]Stay with it.
[227:09.95]You can do this.
[227:17.50]Hit through the door, Source Engine, please.
[227:27.40]Just don't scare me like that.
[227:33.00]Oh my god, get out of the way.
[227:34.97]Get... Dude, you blew it.
[227:38.93]You blew it.
[227:56.58]Put on the Orc song.
[228:03.77]End of the games tonight.
[228:04.41]I'm probably going to wrap it up after this round.
[228:09.44]I might actually stream tomorrow, maybe.
[228:11.12]Depends.
[228:14.60]I'm not sure.
[228:21.47]But on Thursday, we'll start a new game.
[228:24.43]I just kind of felt like I need to push back.
[228:31.01]Command song.
[228:32.82]No orc song.
[228:47.37]Hmm, where are you?
[228:57.91]He's going for a godly shot, but I'm not going to get it.
[229:01.07]I'm not going to get those.
[229:01.85]Why am I going for them?
[229:03.92]I'm in trouble.
[229:09.44]This guy.
[229:19.71]This guy just punching me.
[229:21.93]Can you stop punching me?
[229:24.41]Come on.
[229:26.41]It's distracting.
[229:40.45]Oh my god, Fred, you're so good.
[229:42.45]That sounds like I made a bot to say that.
[229:45.61]But thank you.
[229:46.25]I thought that was a bad guy.
[229:49.36]18 seconds.

[230:31.85]Alright, guys.
[230:32.99]I think that's going to be it.
[230:38.33]Thanks for coming out.
[230:38.97]Thanks for sticking around.
[230:40.59]We'll be back at least on Thursday.
[230:43.16]And I'm going to try to do something on Thursday.
[230:45.18]It might be fun.
[230:45.90]We'll see if I can get it ready.
[230:51.80]But yeah, no jokes at all.
[230:53.74]I'm not even kidding.
[230:56.10]I'm going to do a clown.
[230:57.66]I'm driving a clown car on stream.
[231:04.49]But there was like an extreme amount of support tonight.
[231:07.59]Thank you to everybody that decided to be a part of that.
[231:11.82]And for everybody just watching, again, hope you guys had a good holiday.

[233:07.40]Probably, yeah.
[233:07.86]Who cares?
[233:08.28]I don't think I give a shit anymore.
[233:10.82]You think I care if I look like shit on stream?
[233:12.69]You already saw me like ten times anyways.
[233:15.37]Let's see.
[233:17.75]Alright, let's see.
[233:18.21]Let's examine my hair.
[233:20.01]What do you think?
[233:21.45]Hold on, let me move this shit out of the way.
[233:24.17]Okay.
[233:25.37]See?
[233:26.69]No gray hair.
[233:28.63]I don't see any.
[233:30.38]Do you see any?
[233:32.70]No.
[233:34.74]It's perfect.
[233:38.52]Oh, it's perfect.
[233:42.83]What if I was bald?
[233:44.87]Let's just go like bald.
[233:49.23]I got like some hair sticking up over here.
[233:54.66]Hey, thanks, Croton, for the bits.
[233:57.40]Ear cam.
[233:59.34]I don't see any gray.
[234:00.22]I don't see any gray.
[234:02.66]I just see a couple of bugs.
[234:04.62]That's all I see.
[234:05.32]I see some bugs.
[234:06.33]It gets so fucking hot in here, man.
[234:11.03]It really does.
[234:12.71]Hold on a second.
[234:13.51]I think I'm an idiot.
[234:15.09]I'm an idiot.
[234:16.89]So I have a space heater back here, right?
[234:18.45]This is just a little space heater here.
[234:20.62]Can you guys see what it's currently at?
[234:22.42]I didn't even know it was on here.
[234:29.67]That's 75 degrees.
[234:31.63]It's been pumping.
[234:33.24]This room is like 80 degrees right now because I forgot to turn it down from 75.
[234:38.52]What a fucking idiot.
[234:40.34]That's why it's like so... That's why it's so hot in here.
[234:44.78]Paper towels in the back.
[234:45.81]I'm cleaning.
[234:46.61]I think there was a rat in there.
[234:49.95]No.
[234:50.43]No rats.
[234:52.51]At least no rats that I can see.
[234:58.22]But thank you.
[234:58.90]Good night.
[234:59.70]See you guys later.
