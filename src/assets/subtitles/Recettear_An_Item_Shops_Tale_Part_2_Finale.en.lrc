[00:01.48]Hi, guys.
[00:02.66]Welcome back.
[00:07.49]Those of you that, uh, joined us yesterday, we're gonna be continuing.
[00:13.79]Sit down.
[00:14.19]Sit down!
[00:17.23]Someone's standing on their desk back there.
[00:19.39]Sit down.
[00:21.79]Callin' your fuckin' mom.
[00:25.64]To tell her about all the things you do wrong here in this room.
[00:30.74]I'm going to do item shop again.
[00:33.54]Reset here.
[00:34.10]Receipt here.
[00:36.66]Part two.
[00:41.90]I'm having a lot of fun.
[00:45.00]Our newest hurdle we have to climb up here is $200,000.
[00:54.45]I almost didn't do the last one.
[00:56.55]$80,000 seems very difficult to go over.
[01:02.46]I'm going to do my best to try to get past $200,000.
[01:04.74]But anyways, relax.
[01:09.54]Stretch your legs out.
[01:12.08]Stretch your back out.
[01:14.50]We'll be going very shortly.
[01:20.00]See you in two seconds.
[02:20.97]Okay.
[02:24.19]Mouse off-screen, I already know.
[02:25.65]So here, I freaked out.
[02:28.11]And this is a day... Imagine you could do this to shit in real life.
[02:33.85]Wait, my bills are due.
[02:34.87]My bills are due on the 21st.
[02:37.91]Uh, hold on.
[02:39.05]Let me go through the whole day and try to make as much money and try to, like, sell stuff as fast as I possibly can.
[02:45.46]And then, did I do it tomorrow?
[02:51.34]If only that were possible.
[03:00.49]IRL or in the game?
[03:01.63]Well, I mean like IRL.
[03:05.89]You could do that in real life.
[03:09.57]Well, the idea is you try to pay your bills on time.
[03:13.41]And not have a fantasy of freezing time to be able to pay your bills in one day.
[03:22.57]Anyways.
[03:26.71]Procrastination.
[03:33.61]That's not... That's really bad procrastination.
[03:39.19]I understand, like, not brushing your teeth for a day and, like, waiting until 7.30 p.m.
[03:45.37]before you're like, fuck, I probably should brush my teeth.
[03:49.45]That's procrastination.
[03:52.43]Waiting until 1159, the day before your bills are due.
[03:56.17]That's irresponsibility.
[03:58.47]Let's just, come on, let's just call it, come on.
[04:04.42]Anyway, here is our shop.
[04:09.32]Uh, you see on the 29th we owe... $200,000.
[04:23.55]So what the hell, what was the last thing I did?
[04:25.11]Let's see.
[04:28.03]Yes, and those of you, look, there's a whole new slew of people that are gonna come to the stream, and I know, it is an animated Japanese-style television game, but just give it a minute, because I know you just heard that.
[04:43.40]You heard that sound, and you were just like, I'm out of here, but just wait.
[04:49.20]This game's very fun, just give it a minute.
[04:51.93]We gave it a few minutes yesterday.
[04:53.43]We gave it actually seven and a half hours yesterday.
[04:56.07]It was worth it.
[04:58.71]Turn the voice off.
[05:01.88]I'm going to get shit for this, but I turned... I turned the voice down since yesterday.
[05:13.95]It's me.
[05:19.42]I didn't think anybody was gonna notice, and you probably wouldn't have noticed, except for somebody said that they could hear it.
[05:26.87]That's alright, that's a decent level.
[05:29.37]Oh, goddammit.
[05:34.74]There, that's better.
[05:35.32]Alright, see?
[05:38.34]You're fine.
[05:39.40]Anyways, the whole point of this game, if you weren't here yesterday, is you gotta buy high, sell low.
[05:45.52]You gotta bind items, you gotta put them in your store, and then people buy them, and you gotta haggle with them.
[05:50.56]So, uh, what's the- what was the last thing that happened here?
[05:58.91]We ju- uh, right, right, right, right.
[06:00.05]We just got a new day here.
[06:01.17]I'm gonna put the wooden chest piece here.
[06:03.77]Wait, wait, did I just- I just did I get a really expensive fucking item?
[06:08.37]I did.
[06:08.63]Right here. $15,000.
[06:18.22]There was other things.
[06:18.94]Oh, right.
[06:19.56]All this shit.
[06:26.26]I want to hear the voices.
[06:27.04]They're fine.
[06:27.92]I turned it back up.
[06:33.49]Necklace.
[06:33.79]Alright, I think I'm ready to... I can't craft anything else, right?
[06:39.17]I'm going to hold on to this shit.
[06:42.35]Here we go.
[06:43.85]Time to open this door.
[06:47.81]No charm, welcome.
[06:51.76]Nope, a bright and happy welcome is a key to sales.
[06:58.36]Good products is a key to sales.
[07:00.60]I got a present for you.
[07:06.90]Oh, shit.
[07:09.73]We just got a new fucking hero card.
[07:13.03]Wait, there's a 60 second slow mode on right now?
[07:20.43]That's pretty slow.
[07:22.95]Hold on, wait, let me fix it.
[07:29.89]How about, uh, how about, uh... 15?
[07:33.01]20?
[07:33.39]What did I just do?
[07:47.80]Oh shit, I did something wrong.
[07:53.10]I think I just broke it.
[07:53.88]Uh-oh.
[08:02.67]Uh-oh.
[08:06.79]Uh... Uh-oh!
[08:12.61]There is now no slow-mo!
[08:21.53]There we go.
[08:21.91]10 second slow-mo.
[08:22.89]We got it.
[08:24.73]I think.
[08:25.21]Yeah.
[08:27.11]I think I like turned it off.
[08:32.22]Alright, we're good.
[08:32.70]We're good.
[08:33.42]Well, we got a card.
[08:34.20]I was wondering why I didn't see any PogChamps over here.
[08:37.38]We got a fucking R2-D2 card.
[08:39.56]And I looked over and I didn't see any PogChamps.
[08:41.18]I was like, what's going on here?
[08:44.30]Usually there'd be like 2,000 of them.
[08:49.01]Damn straight.
[08:50.09]If you ever need the help of a professional Berk such as myself, give me a look.
[08:56.33]Go into negative slow mode?
[08:57.49]You can't do that.
[09:02.36]So are we dumping this dude in here right now?
[09:05.26]What's his name?
[09:06.72]Louie?
[09:11.33]Do a six hour slow mode?
[09:14.20]You know, I thought about doing a stream before of having a permanent slow mode, like 12 hours or something.
[09:20.00]So you get to say one thing in chat and you better make it count.
[09:31.09]Do it.
[09:31.67]Do it.
[09:32.11]No, that has to be something that's planned.
[09:33.71]Not during reciteer and item shops.
[09:36.13]Actually, that's a pretty great time to do it.
[09:38.81]No, it's not.
[09:39.17]I want to get... No, no.
[09:41.58]I want real feedback of stuff.
[09:43.89]Of selling and buying.
[09:51.25]Well, receipt's been good to me.
[09:52.62]Consider it my way of paying guys back.
[09:54.14]Alright, we got a new card.
[09:56.33]By the way, for those of you that weren't here yesterday, when you get a card from somebody, it means that they had to buy them for everybody in the class.
[10:05.49]Because so everybody gets a Valentine in the class.
[10:07.85]So you have like 20 cards and you have to hand them out to everybody.
[10:11.83]Even if you might not want to hand them out to everybody, your mother still tells you to do that.
[10:15.86]And you're like, ah, I guess.
[10:20.26]Come on!
[10:41.75]I didn't get one.
[10:42.71]I only wanted to give my Valentine to like my two friends in the class so we could like make jokes on the cards.
[10:51.98]I couldn't make jokes.
[10:53.12]Are you really just some random dispassionate loan shark?
[11:12.32]Should have undid slow mode to max out the minus twos.
[11:15.02]Yeah, hold on a minute.
[11:15.62]That's bullshit.
[11:22.61]10 second slow mode.
[11:23.43]Usually it's like 20 to 30 second slow mode.
[11:25.47]I'm getting dumped here.
[11:26.59]This is fucking market manipulation at its finest.
[11:36.37]Anyways, let's go.
[11:39.10]I've been wondering, if all you're really after is getting that loan repaid, wouldn't it be a lot easier just to steal the house and cash out?
[11:46.42]Nothing's stopping you after all, except for one thing.
[11:48.76]The law.
[11:51.36]That is not it at all.
[11:52.52]As an agent of Termi, I... take a little bit of friendly advice.
[11:57.18]The harder you try to spin some elaborate tale, the worse it ends up being when the web comes apart at the end.
[12:04.56]Not that I have any room to lecture anyone on that front.
[12:09.27]So sticking to your guns, just a loan shark then.
[12:13.47]Unbelievable.
[12:14.27]Did you give her your card just to ask me that?
[12:18.67]Maybe I did.
[12:20.13]Guess I've been a bit of a busybody, eh?
[12:23.72]Everyone who comes through that door is like that.
[12:25.92]That girl.
[12:26.90]Something about her inspires people to care.
[12:30.60]I suppose she does that.
[12:34.68]Are you gonna buy something or what?
[12:41.65]Well then, let me know if you need my help.
[12:44.22]Hey, thanks again.
[12:49.48]So, thank you for all that.
[12:51.86]I appreciate the card.
[12:54.30]Now let's sell something.
[12:55.36]What can I help you with?
[12:56.22]I want some food.
[12:58.68]I got plenty of food.
[13:02.49]Ooh, holy shit, I got honey.
[13:05.31]No, no, no, no.
[13:06.01]This girl's cheap.
[13:08.23]She won't spend $2,300 on that.
[13:11.55]Let's go the... Let's go the egg code.
[13:19.68]Six, uh, 600 bucks.
[13:21.78]That's too much.
[13:22.50]Right.
[13:23.40]You don't pay over for anything.
[13:30.92]She never pays more than, like, 99% over.
[13:38.29]She's back again.
[13:39.01]Alright, I want the fish too.
[13:40.74]I don't know, she wants to sell this to me.
[13:42.08]45% of base, take it or lose it.
[13:47.74]Yes, I'm not going any higher.
[13:53.24]Avocado toast.
[14:03.75]Stop letting her do this.
[14:07.80]Alright, Miss Capitalist, in two days, I want you to get two scarves for me.
[14:10.62]I don't know if I can do that.
[14:22.15]I have to buy them.
[14:27.05]No, there we go.
[14:28.75]I put an order for... Uh-oh.
[14:38.96]Uh-oh.
[14:43.10]Probably should have checked that before we started.
[14:59.04]Should I reload?
[14:59.80]Yeah, but then we have to do that whole scene again.
[15:03.02]I would have done... But hold on, this guy's... Are we gonna get this... This guy's about to drop 15 grand.
[15:07.33]Should I reset it?
[15:16.26]No, that's my own fault.
[15:17.16]I fucked that up.
[15:17.92]I need to be a better store owner.
[15:20.10]This is a big sale here, though.
[15:22.27]Maybe like 20,000?
[15:22.67]Nah, he's not gonna pay 200% for this.
[15:31.98]I'm gonna start at 21.
[15:43.08]No.
[15:43.38]Alright, I gotta go down.
[15:46.34]Shit.
[15:48.26]Ah, 19?
[15:48.42]19, 5?
[15:51.50]No.
[15:52.30]No, it's gotta be like 18.
[15:53.14]Got it.
[15:57.34]There it goes.
[16:06.33]I sold it.
[16:10.91]Could use a treasure.
[16:12.98]Do I have any treasures?
[16:15.26]Eh.
[16:17.94]I mean, could I just... This is technically a treasure, isn't it?
[16:26.40]Could I be like, what can I interest you in one of these?
[16:29.62]I guess you have to get a statue. 128.
[16:42.72]It's not under the treasure tab.
[16:44.00]It's not a treasure.
[16:44.88]I see, I see.
[16:45.58]Makes sense.
[16:48.62]You have a bracelet.
[16:50.51]I do.
[16:50.83]I have a really good bracelet, actually.
[16:52.21]Don't I?
[16:57.05]You're not gonna... No.
[16:59.71]She's not gonna pay 2600 bucks for this.
[17:00.83]Okay.
[17:14.32]28.
[17:16.30]Ah!
[17:17.76]Why did I even try to sell it to you?
[17:19.32]25? 26.
[17:42.87]She never buys anything.
[17:44.57]Alright, I gotta take some stock here.
[17:49.21]Hold on.
[17:51.95]What do we have for orders?
[17:53.63]So tomorrow, I need two weapons and two foodstuffs.
[17:56.79]By tomorrow.
[17:59.95]I need weapons.
[18:00.81]Alright, let's go get some weapons.
[18:09.03]If I was an item in this game, I'd be under the treasure tab.
[18:13.51]Oh, what?
[18:14.63]That was so cute.
[18:18.83]Thank you.
[18:19.53]Alright, hold on, let's go to fusion.
[18:28.48]I need a stat, I have bat wings.
[18:32.44]Back scratcher and impetition staff.
[18:40.10]I don't have any three, honey, I only have one.
[18:44.20]Can't do that anymore.
[18:45.08]What else have we got here?
[18:48.54]Ooh.
[18:49.54]The price is currently down on this, but I do have a charred lizard.
[18:54.00]I have a shell necklace.
[18:55.04]I could get a shell necklace right now.
[19:04.77]It's from the other store, right?
[19:10.09]Let's do it.
[19:14.41]Wait, wait, wait.
[19:14.81]I need... No, no, no.
[19:15.63]I need... No, you're right.
[19:16.61]I need this for the dude.
[19:19.69]Fuck.
[19:20.87]It's alright.
[19:21.41]I need two weapons then.
[19:23.11]I'm gonna say... Let's go with the expensive shit.
[19:30.96]Let's go with the thief's knife.
[19:35.04]And... A steel sword.
[19:36.36]I'm gonna make cash tonight.
[19:42.80]And then I need two foodstuffs.
[19:44.02]I think I already have it.
[19:47.46]Let's go to the pub.
[19:49.32]Sit down and find out what we need to do.
[19:55.10]Oh, she's drunk.
[19:57.08]Ah, silly fairy.
[19:58.58]You can't schtick a person in a cup.
[20:01.20]Maybe I could stuff you into one, though.
[20:04.13]Hee tee hee.
[20:05.47]You want some of this?
[20:08.35]Are you drunk?
[20:09.07]Or are you doing like a Sean Connery impression?
[20:11.03]I don't understand.
[20:13.59]I believe I shall pass.
[20:16.09]Oh, welp, you're lost then.
[20:17.75]You're a shtick in the mud.
[20:19.91]Maybe Reset'll want some.
[20:25.97]What is this?
[20:27.91]Stop clinging to her, for heaven's sake.
[20:29.57]I swear if we're professional, Burke, you could not hold your liquor at all.
[20:35.56]What are you again?
[20:36.34]I told you, no!
[20:39.88]What is...
[20:42.93]Come on, can't a guy get a break?
[20:44.53]Cut me just a little slack here.
[20:48.81]Not just no, but hell no.
[20:50.22]Do you have any idea how long your tab already is?
[20:54.02]You'll drink me out of a business at this rate.
[20:56.68]Son of a... Alright, alright, I can take a hint.
[21:00.88]I'll call it for the day.
[21:03.90]Who's that guy?
[21:04.64]Oh, what an argument.
[21:07.13]Oh, him?
[21:07.61]That happens all the time.
[21:10.77]That guy keeps putting stuff on his tab and doesn't pay up.
[21:15.97]So he keeps getting chased out.
[21:20.51]I think he even has Louis beat when he comes to... What?
[21:24.99]Oh, okay, hold on.
[21:26.73]I think he even has Louis beat when it comes to being poor.
[21:30.57]Well, either way, why don't worry too much about it?
[21:35.08]Oh, absolutely not!
[22:07.08]The plaza in the evening feels kind of lonely.
[22:09.18]It makes you think it's really time to go home now.
[22:12.42]You really think it has that effect?
[22:13.54]I don't feel... Oh, it does.
[22:16.58]Oh, and the smell of the evening... I thought that said piss.
[22:18.92]It makes it even lonelier.
[22:22.37]Well, as a fairy, I cannot pretend to understand how smell could make you lonely.
[22:27.97]But our dinner tonight is going to be salted porridge.
[22:31.53]It certainly will not be pie.
[22:34.59]Salted porridge.
[22:37.81]That's like the default gross food, isn't it?
[22:41.95]That's the stuff that comes out of an ice cream scoop.
[22:44.43]In every movie.
[22:47.31]Oh man, now I really feel lonely for some reason.
[22:59.68]College life dinner.
[23:02.26]No, they don't serve that in college dining halls.
[23:07.91]You don't line up and have them, you hand out your tray and somebody dumps porridge onto the tray.
[23:15.63]That's not a school I don't think I want to be at.
[23:32.32]What?
[23:32.72]What school did you go to where they did a line of porridge?
[23:37.68]Like all of a twist!
[23:50.99]Impro... Alright, let's go.
[23:57.85]I need to make some money here.
[24:06.41]So, I need... What do they want?
[24:09.89]I need two weapons, which I have, and then two foodstuffs, right.
[24:13.63]I think I already have that.
[24:16.15]I do.
[24:17.29]I have two pieces of food, don't I?
[24:18.61]Yeah, I do.
[24:20.85]I'm 99%.
[24:23.03]Scaves?
[24:23.86]What's a scave?
[24:24.52]Scarves.
[24:26.42]How do you say scarves?
[24:27.44]Scarves?
[24:28.66]Scarves.
[24:40.30]It's got staff and stave.
[24:42.54]That's what screws me up.
[24:43.54]Why?
[24:44.02]Staff, stave.
[24:45.86]Scarf, scaves.
[24:53.19]I can just do two shitty ones, right?
[25:01.15]Yeah, let's get the expensive one.
[25:05.41]Alright, I'm ready.
[25:08.87]Am I enjoying the game?
[25:09.55]I think the game's great.
[25:15.73]I want... Let's put the helm out there.
[25:17.28]I have enough food, right?
[25:22.04]Yeah, I do.
[25:31.50]Oh, hey, welcome!
[25:33.44]Hey, Reset, listen to this.
[25:35.42]Why are you... Are you still, like, drunk?
[25:38.21]It's been, like, fucking 12 hours.
[25:40.81]What is it?
[25:41.73]And are you okay?
[25:42.35]You seem a little different.
[25:44.55]So, I got a message from the guild today.
[25:48.69]They totally found a new dungeon with some shit shit shit.
[25:54.78]Nobody does that when they're drunk.
[25:57.69]I don't know why everybody decided to take that one old Looney Tunes cartoon of the mouse.
[26:04.20]Going like... Everybody just copied it.
[26:07.18]That doesn't happen.
[26:13.62]Really, really, super really.
[26:16.95]Everyone is calling it the Amber Garden.
[26:20.41]Boy, I hope it's that kind of Amber.
[26:23.87]The Amber Garden.
[26:26.39]Huh.
[26:28.37]Charm?
[26:31.55]Amber.
[26:32.09]Like water.
[26:33.61]Herbal.
[26:34.63]Snork.
[26:37.75]I gotta be... There's a line here I'm crossing where I'm starting to turn into Little Nikki.
[26:43.73]So... Oh, what was I talking about?
[26:48.91]Oh yeah, so if you get the chance, we should totally go.
[26:53.01]I mean, who knows what kind of items we could find.
[26:57.05]Yeah, items.
[26:57.89]Yeah, that's true.
[27:01.23]Well then, back to the pub with me.
[27:03.16]Fwoosh.
[27:05.78]Oh, the Joker.
[27:09.84]Yeah, that is... Oh, it could be the Joker, too.
[27:16.33]A new dungeon, huh?
[27:17.91]Ooh.
[27:18.79]Unlocked.
[27:19.19]Let's start buying shit.
[27:22.55]Candy apple.
[27:24.69]Two thousand.
[27:33.32]Back.
[27:34.42]They want the helm.
[27:35.10]Now that, I'm sorry, but that's 2300.
[27:37.44]Make it a little cheaper.
[27:41.55]That's a very rare item.
[27:43.05]It's a warrior's helm.
[27:45.59]Thank you.
[27:49.83]Yeah, I sold the warrior's helm.
[27:54.56]Looking for something?
[27:56.88]Oh, the more I look at this, the more I just need to have it.
[27:59.34]What's your tall and filthy... I don't even... Do you buy stuff?
[28:05.46]Or are you cheap or what?
[28:08.48]A little less?
[28:10.30]720.
[28:10.38]Oh, fuck off.
[28:16.41]Egg.
[28:16.75]Pick this one.
[28:17.55]What do you mean, egg?
[28:21.45]This guy's getting ready to fight.
[28:24.82]Alright, well, hold on.
[28:25.54]He's either getting ready to fight or play a game of hockey.
[28:29.92]These items could be used for hockey as well.
[28:32.08]That makes sense.
[28:32.72]Alright, let's do, uh, a thousand.
[28:40.37]Same thing.
[28:41.03]Ooh, the two foodstuffs!
[28:48.81]Oh, wait.
[28:50.68]Yes, I can do two foodstuffs in two days.
[28:56.78]Ah, here's the end of the day.
[28:57.58]He's ready to go fight Grandma's ghost.
[29:09.54]Hey, can you turn her voice off and also the game, please?
[29:15.34]That's just not gonna happen.
[29:17.66]News!
[29:18.08]The price of daggers has increased!
[29:19.82]Ooh.
[29:23.44]The price of daggers has increased.
[29:27.86]Alright, here we go.
[29:33.69]And I got two.
[29:34.31]This is gonna be insane.
[29:36.79]Hold on.
[29:38.73]I need to... I'm gonna sell these on the floor.
[29:45.50]Somebody wants... Hold on.
[29:49.12]I'm buying some stupid, shitty item.
[29:52.08]Wait, what?
[29:53.99]I have a little problem that I need your help with.
[29:56.67]We automatically refuse to place horse heads in anyone's bed.
[30:01.54]I would like a fucking, like, nine-year-old know what that is.
[30:05.92]Oh, no, nothing like that.
[30:07.06]Here, actually, I have a package that needs to be delivered to the orphanage near Town Square.
[30:11.74]You've seen it, right?
[30:13.26]I'm a bit busy right now, so... Oh, yeah, sure, we can do that.
[30:17.16]Thanks, girls.
[30:17.76]This will help me out.
[30:19.63]Alright, then, package acquired.
[30:20.81]Charge forth.
[30:22.47]Indeed, not a bad idea.
[30:25.70]The Merchant's Guild has been generous to us in the past, so getting them into our pocket now will only help us down the road.
[30:32.08]And you are now... Wait, wait a minute here.
[30:35.60]For the orphans.
[30:36.18]Let's go!
[30:37.51]Now, hold on a second here.
[30:38.87]Girls, I... Thank you.
[30:44.53]I hope everyone enjoys the package.
[30:46.67]Delivery successful.
[30:47.63]Forward to Janus.
[30:49.49]Now, hold on a minute here, girls.
[30:51.40]Well, I'm glad we were able to... By the way, yeah, I did read that out loud.
[30:55.65]Well, I am glad we were able to get that done with quickly.
[30:59.35]I'll say, everyone seemed to like the package.
[31:02.57]Although, what do you think they'll do with, I mean, just the... Honestly, I would rather not think about what's in the package.
[31:11.77]Blasted Guildmaster, I think I would have preferred the horse head.
[31:16.17]Well, either way, we pulled it off.
[31:17.49]Back to the shop.
[31:19.65]Is the shop going to be on fire or something?
[31:21.45]I don't understand.
[31:23.29]What's up?
[31:24.83]It may be nothing over there, however.
[31:26.85]Is that not... It's the man with the huge bar bill, isn't it?
[31:34.39]Yes, but why on Earth is he hiding behind a wall?
[31:38.48]Hey, yeah, that's suspicious.
[31:43.26]For... Yay!
[31:47.84]Wait, receipt!
[31:55.92]Hold it!
[31:56.28]You there!
[31:57.20]Seize whatever vaguely sneaky thing you're doing at once!
[32:01.16]Whoa!
[32:02.80]This is an orphanage.
[32:03.62]What are you doing here, peering at it like that?
[32:07.16]What?
[32:07.72]Mind telling me who you are, little miss?
[32:10.43]My name is Receipt.
[32:11.23]I run the item shop Receipt on the hill.
[32:13.75]I was on my way home from delivering a package, and I saw you being off-duty!
[32:17.87]Oh, you're the one who runs that, huh?
[32:20.35]Pretty impressive at your age.
[32:23.29]We seem to have gotten off to a bad start.
[32:25.79]Name's Elan.
[32:27.71]In the strictest terms, I guess you could call me an adventurer.
[32:31.42]I kind of owe something to this orphanage, so I stop by a lot.
[32:36.26]Why all the sneakification and peering then?
[32:40.08]I wasn't peering really, I was more gazing at, I guess with guilt.
[32:46.02]What?
[32:46.44]What are you... Times have been a little hard lately.
[32:49.36]You know how it can be.
[32:51.24]I can't afford to buy the kids who live their treats anymore.
[32:54.88]So I think to myself, it'd just be better if I didn't show up at all.
[32:59.12]But still.
[33:01.09]Oh, I see.
[33:01.45]I'm sorry I was angry at you, but... Hey!
[33:05.11]Oh, it's Elon!
[33:07.07]Elon's here!
[33:07.61]He's got treats!
[33:09.17]Oh, shit!
[33:11.27]Oh, hell's bells.
[33:12.65]Now they've seen me.
[33:14.76]Let me, little girl, do you have any treats?
[33:16.92]Gotta let him down and go in empty-handed, I guess.
[33:20.80]It'll be okay.
[33:22.14]Huh?
[33:23.59]Look at them.
[33:24.27]The kids appreciate you, not the gifts.
[33:30.55]Kind of weird for a merchant to say you don't need gifts, I guess.
[33:33.81]But it's true, really.
[33:34.81]Go on, they're waiting.
[33:35.59]Guess we'll miss.
[33:40.30]Come play with us, Elon.
[33:42.44]I'm gonna be the guard, okay?
[33:43.84]You're the thief.
[33:47.82]Your fans await, Mr. Elon.
[33:50.01]Good luck.
[33:51.51]Oh, maybe you should go easy on the alcohol, too.
[33:54.79]For their sake.
[33:58.66]She sure told me.
[33:59.66]Huh.
[34:09.45]Go easy on the alcohol.
[34:11.08]Was it my imagination, or was that a fairy giving me a hell of an evil eye just now?
[34:17.66]That's not the correct voice for that guy.
[34:19.22]It's gotta be lighter.
[34:19.96]I guess that's the wrong voice.
[34:34.29]Hi, are you okay, miss?
[34:35.26]You look kinda down.
[34:36.16]I'll reset, I'm
[34:38.25]Tired for some reason.
[34:39.92]I wonder if I'm starting to get old and slow.
[34:43.38]If you're tired, it can help to eat something sweet.
[34:46.26]Don't do that.
[34:47.86]Sugar stimulates your parasympathetic nervous system and energizes you.
[34:53.48]That sounds like big company propaganda is what that sounds like, Little Miss.
[34:59.81]I don't know where you got that bullshit from.
[35:03.77]Anyway, you should go eat something sweet.
[35:07.30]Like, for example, candy or canned peaches.
[35:11.86]We have a lot of sweet stuff to choose from.
[35:15.61]That does sound good.
[35:17.51]Maybe I'll have some chocolate cake.
[35:20.69]Thanks for the advice, you two.
[35:27.39]Oh, cake.
[35:27.95]Now I'm jealous.
[35:34.16]Business opportunity.
[35:45.23]Imagine going to the doctor and being like, yeah, something's, like, wrong.
[35:47.49]I'm, like, really fucking tired all the time.
[35:50.34]I, like, I kind of, like, feel like shit.
[35:52.34]I'm, like, sleepy in the morning.
[35:53.76]I'm, like, I don't have, like, really any energy.
[35:56.34]I'm a little bit down.
[35:57.74]Oh, well, you see, what you should eat is a cake.
[36:01.64]What?
[36:02.66]Yeah, just eat a cake.
[36:04.65]See you in a few months when you're coming back for something else.
[36:12.10]You don't think I should probably start exercising?
[36:14.36]No, just eat candy out of a jar.
[36:17.52]That's the kind of scenario where all of a sudden, like, they've done, like, comedy routines where then that, like, that doctor is, like, arrested.
[36:24.86]And it's like, holy shit, that guy's pretending to be the doctor.
[36:27.14]And the real doctor is, like, in the back.
[36:30.66]Like, tied up or something.
[36:31.56]They've done that before, right?
[36:38.42]Alright, let me see.
[36:38.86]What do I have to do today?
[36:39.54]What do I have to do?
[36:45.05]Today is two weapons, two foodstuffs.
[36:47.71]I have the scarves.
[36:48.53]I have all the food.
[36:49.13]I have everything I need.
[36:52.13]I got everything I need.
[36:54.56]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[36:56.00]Not quite true, though.
[36:57.10]Hold on.
[36:59.02]I want to put these out on the floor.
[37:00.88]Because I can sell them for way, way more than they're worth.
[37:07.02]And then I'm going to get two shitty weapons and then overprice the fuck out of them when they come in to buy them.
[37:14.36]Or should I overprice the fuck out of these in the order?
[37:18.34]I wonder.
[37:18.64]Alright, I'll put them in the order.
[37:28.13]Let's get the necklace out there.
[37:30.09]What else do I got?
[37:32.79]Nobody buys the rings.
[37:33.69]Alright, that seems good.
[37:37.66]Let me just make sure I got plenty of food.
[37:39.56]I got the two weapons.
[37:41.22]I'm ready to go.
[37:41.74]Let's get an orange up there, too.
[37:48.27]Here we go.
[37:52.75]Oh, hello there, receipt.
[37:53.57]Still manning the store as always, I see.
[37:56.21]Hi, Alouette.
[37:56.99]You look like you're in a good... That was fucking loud.
[38:00.14]I don't know why.
[38:01.46]That just scared the shit out of me.
[38:03.94]Uh, but anyways.
[38:05.92]Thank you for... I thought that was in the game.
[38:08.10]Uh, that was $50.
[38:12.82]And that was... Inieuro... Inieuroia Palace...
[38:18.42]In Eurya Palace for 50 bucks.
[38:23.80]Thank you so much.
[38:25.30]They say, hey Jerma, love you a lot.
[38:27.10]Thank you for all the years that helped me get through tough shit with laughter.
[38:30.76]Show love a thousand five times.
[38:35.06]Thank you so much for the 50 dollars.
[38:41.30]Much love to you.
[38:41.78]That's a fucking lot of money.
[38:42.66]Thank you.
[38:45.75]And not to derail this, but somebody just said they went to... I'm not even going to say it.
[38:49.61]Because that's going to derail the whole stream, but like the rest of the night.
[38:53.56]I am.
[38:54.04]Father and I are going on an excursion to eat foie gras in a bit.
[39:04.15]What's a foie gras?
[39:06.35]It sounds kind of mean.
[39:09.07]What?
[39:09.37]You don't know what foie gras is?
[39:11.39]Poverty is a curse.
[39:13.99]Aw, Tyr, help me out over here.
[39:20.19]Yes, very well.
[39:22.41]Foie gras is a food made from goose liver and is generally considered to be a high-class dish, due in part to what is involved in creating it.
[39:30.22]By overfeeding the geese, excess fat accumulates in the liver, significantly changing the taste.
[39:35.04]The process is lengthy, naturally, as a dish that is typically sauteed and then eaten.
[39:42.66]Okay, is it yummy, though?
[39:44.93]Naturally, it's a delicacy of the upper crust, after all.
[39:48.74]It utterly lacks any texture.
[39:50.92]It's strangely meaty and oily.
[39:52.56]It's truly the ultimate in rare tastes.
[39:55.70]But it's yummy, right?
[39:59.27]Of course it is, silly plebeian.
[40:05.01]Why can't we just eat shit?
[40:15.88]We're gonna find all these fucked up ways to make food.
[40:19.48]How bored are we as a society?
[40:25.17]Oh, hi, welcome!
[40:26.49]Do you have a hat?
[40:30.69]I actually don't have any hats.
[40:38.11]Society no, I'm sorry the word society has taken on this like meme terminology now if you say the word society It's like well.
[40:46.80]He said society.
[40:48.04]He said society He said they said it I Don't have any hats.
[40:57.62]I'm sorry No, it's okay if you don't have any you don't
[41:11.45]Hi there.
[41:12.05]Ooh, do you want to sell you this bread?
[41:13.55]31 cents.
[41:18.31]It's bread.
[41:18.83]I don't want to buy you bread.
[41:19.91]Oh, here we go.
[41:34.24]Okay, so we got an opportunity to make 10 grand.
[41:42.98]150?
[41:43.08]15,000?
[41:43.10]50k!
[41:43.64]That's not gonna fly.
[41:45.08]No, no way.
[41:47.53]I'll start at 150.
[41:48.35]Whoops.
[41:48.59]No, not 1, 2, 3, 4.
[41:56.81]How about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?
[42:11.69]I think I could do 150.
[42:12.67]That's a... come on.
[42:17.69]That's a hundred and fifty percent.
[42:21.81]She will back out immediately if it's too high.
[42:23.87]That's right.
[42:28.64]That's a really good price for that ring.
[42:30.28]I got that ring for like six grand.
[42:36.18]Hey, do you have my foodstuffs?
[42:37.32]I do.
[42:39.71]Let's see.
[42:40.51]How can I get the maximum amount of money from you?
[42:42.79]I'm going to hold on to the honey, because I feel like I'm going to need it in some recipe somewhere.
[42:46.87]Candy apple, and then a beef brain.
[42:52.32]Perfect!
[42:53.64]That'll be... 6,000.
[42:56.34]I wonder if you'll do it.
[43:09.33]Slightly... I want a slightly better deal.
[43:16.47]54.
[43:16.93]5,000.
[43:21.22]Yes!

[43:34.74]It's the weapons, right?
[43:38.31]Do you want a yam?

[43:52.05]I'm not getting scammed Alright weapons Thief's knife and crafter's knife and this is where we get this is where we get to be a really bad person.
[44:07.26]Oh
[44:12.30]Because these things are in hot demand right now, and it's in order.
[44:16.02]So I'm thinking like $15,000.
[44:16.76]$14,000, I think.
[44:17.04]Alright, okay.
[44:17.36]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[44:18.88]$12,000.
[44:25.88]Fuck!

[44:49.67]Those items are in fucking hot demand!
[45:04.56]Inuria Palace gave another 50 bucks.
[45:11.47]You butchered my name, so here's money to go back to school.
[45:14.35]I'm so bad with names.
[45:18.79]Thank you for the hundred dollars though, dude.
[45:20.33]For real.
[45:27.92]That's a shitload of money.
[45:28.94]Thank you.

[45:31.96]I don't have hats.
[45:38.81]What's that robot's deal?
[45:41.19]He's usually 250 to 300.
[45:42.17]Oh, that's not good.
[45:45.70]Get him off.
[45:48.22]Usually 250 to 300 is, um, percent.
[45:51.04]Works when it's a red item.
[45:53.94]Looks like I'm just gonna sell them.
[45:58.16]Accessories are down.
[45:59.19]Get that shit out of here.
[46:00.09]Hey!
[46:11.71]What do we got here?
[46:12.67]I got... Somebody wanted scarves today, right?
[46:15.85]Let's get the shoes out here.
[46:19.19]I need to go on an adventure.
[46:26.28]Yeah, let me fill that order.
[46:27.44]Let me hold on.
[46:29.86]Let's get some powerful antioxidants out here or whatever this is.
[46:35.40]Keep the bad wings.
[46:37.78]Get the baked yam up there.
[46:38.92]No, no, no.

[47:29.32]I got a baked yam right here.
[47:34.55]2600.
[47:34.67]That's too expensive.
[47:46.19]2400.
[47:49.78]When she died, my grandmother told me to sell this if I ever got into trouble.
[48:01.92]Oh, I just insulted your entire family.
[48:07.56]Ooh, I was looking for one of these.
[48:10.14]Where are you now?
[48:14.97]I think I can get away with like 200 and... 200%... 205?

[48:42.04]What can I get you?

[48:53.01]Here we go.

[49:01.85]1200.
[49:01.87]Take it or leave it.
[49:13.24]Give it to the Twix kids.
[49:14.54]Oh, here we go.
[49:20.28]It pains me to part with this.
[49:23.26]It's just a piece of candy.
[49:27.09]The price is wrong.
[49:28.63]Ooh.
[49:33.89]Ah, little lady, how much is this?
[49:35.89]Crafter's knife.
[49:37.39]Well, that would be $3,500.
[49:44.42]That'll do!
[49:55.59]Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money!

[50:21.44]Like, a bunch of times.
[50:24.96]Two scarves, two foodstuffs.
[50:27.63]What else can I put out here?
[50:28.59]I'm gonna put the shark fin out here.
[50:33.37]Before we close, let's get some wool.
[50:36.75]Make sure I got two foodstuffs.
[50:39.31]For tomorrow.
[50:40.35]So I'm not putting out any food.
[50:44.71]Should I sell, like, carpets?
[50:46.45]I'm not gonna use them, am I?
[50:47.41]I feel like I don't want to get rid of any of these, like, materials, unless it's for this.
[50:53.63]You know what I mean?
[50:57.79]Like, I have a bunch of them, but I feel like I'm gonna need them.

[57:16.61]Centrist.
[57:22.71]Alright, no support.
[57:24.23]Where was Benjamin Franklin on the political alignment chart?
[57:30.61]That's where I want to be.
[57:45.24]He was a chaotic neutral?
[57:59.20]Franklin was chaotic?

[58:22.05]What's my alignment?
[58:25.19]Ah, yo- ooh, good try!
[58:28.91]I was about to be like, well, you know, if I were for me.
[58:31.92]Oh, good try.

[58:48.48]And by the way, I just want to make sure I go like this because somebody will like clip like a frame and be like, oh, when he said that, he froze like right here.
[58:56.84]You don't fucking have any idea where the fuck I am.
[59:00.96]I'm erratic.
[59:02.70]I'm uncontrollable.
[59:04.20]You have no idea where I could end up.
[59:09.92]I just clicked the X. That would have been so bad.
[59:13.76]That would have been so bad.
[59:18.24]I haven't saved him.
[59:37.38]You don't know what I am.
[59:38.24]You don't know what I am.
[59:39.60]Okay?

[59:43.54]I'm a disciplined emotional.
[59:46.32]That is what I am.
[59:49.00]We came to the determination of that a long time ago.
[59:51.38]Alright, let's go.
[59:58.99]I want to go level up.
[60:03.57]I got plenty of time.
[60:04.27]Actually, no, I don't.

[60:30.49]Two scarves and two foodstuffs, both today.
[60:34.86]I got both of those things.
[60:36.63]Let me just load it up.
[60:38.33]I gotta go... Hold on.
[60:42.77]I gotta buy some stuff.
[60:44.61]First of all, let's do the event.
[60:48.80]Where is she?
[60:50.48]There she is!
[60:50.92]There she is!
[60:51.30]There she is!
[60:51.76]Miss Receipt!
[60:54.46]Oh, hi there!
[60:55.94]So, um, I wanted to thank you, Miss Receipt.
[60:58.94]Thank me for what?
[61:00.27]You helped me with my doll and found my hairpin, remember?
[61:03.91]Oh, no, no, no thanks.
[61:04.77]No thanks necessary, right?
[61:07.24]You seem rather pleased with yourself regardless.
[61:10.32]Is it showing?
[61:11.72]Okay, then I'm gonna start.
[61:12.78]Don't move, okay?
[61:15.12]Start what?
[61:18.88]I'm gonna draw a portrait of you, of course.
[61:20.71]Now don't move.
[61:22.67]Just a couple of quick questions.
[61:23.89]Where do you sit on the political alignment chart?
[61:26.63]Well, I sit... Oh, almost.
[61:28.29]Almost.
[61:34.72]Can I move yet?
[61:36.44]Not yet.
[61:36.90]Give me just a few more minutes.
[61:47.03]Okay, really, can I move yet?
[61:50.23]She's definitely going like this with her teeth clenched.
[61:53.33]Okay, really, can I move yet?
[61:57.10]Just a little bit more.
[61:58.20]And done.
[62:05.47]Phew, being a model is hard.
[62:07.05]My legs feel like tent poles.
[62:09.67]So let's see it.
[62:10.27]Come on.
[62:11.31]Here you go.
[62:11.99]This is me.
[62:16.55]I didn't think my nose... Huh.
[62:20.40]Oh, where am I in this picture?
[62:23.32]Oh, you're right here, Miss Fairy.
[62:26.06]But that is... Is that not a dragonfly?
[62:28.72]Hehe, you're really good.
[62:32.19]Ehehe.
[62:34.50]That was an Ehe.
[62:35.84]I haven't seen that in a long time.
[62:38.72]I really think... I really like this.
[62:40.27]Thank you.
[62:41.43]Thanks, Miss Reset.
[62:43.21]Bye-bye.
[62:47.05]Do I really look that much like a dragonfly?
[62:49.49]I can't believe it.
[62:53.85]Okay, let's go.
[62:54.52]I want to buy some shit.
[63:00.34]I need to sell this.
[63:01.38]I have to start making money.
[63:04.46]I'm gonna buy parade armor.
[63:09.79]And let's get the spiked armband.
[63:15.21]Popular.
[63:15.63]Let's get some charms.
[63:17.21]No, no.
[63:17.59]These things suck.
[63:21.57]Composite bow.
[63:24.98]Practice lands.
[63:25.72]I need high paying items.
[63:41.83]No.
[63:46.21]I... I can do... I need to get into that dungeon.
[63:53.38]No matter what, tomorrow I'm getting a dungeon.
[63:57.19]Let's get these products up here.
[63:58.37]I need to make money.
[64:02.77]4,200.
[64:03.01]It's worth so much.
[64:04.19]I just have to keep doing that.
[64:08.77]Food stuff is today.
[64:10.85]Alright.
[64:11.49]Alright.
[64:11.89]Okay.
[64:12.39]Alright.
[64:12.69]Open the damn store.
[64:20.34]And... Came by to sell this.
[64:22.62]There's something I've noticed about the citizens in this game.
[64:28.08]All they have... They just come in with random food they find in their house on the ground.
[64:34.80]Nobody ever comes in here with a necklace.
[64:37.45]That's worth any money.
[64:38.29]They just come in with fucking yams and apples and bread.
[64:43.32]I would be more inclined to be happy about this if they was... Hey, I found this... Oh, I was in my grandmother's closet today, and after she died, and we found some parade armor.
[64:54.64]I would buy that.
[64:55.50]I'd be happy to do a decent price.
[65:00.46]Okay, well, that's a... Let's do 4,700.
[65:06.83]I'm having a collection of expensive items.
[65:14.72]I do have the food stuff that you asked for.
[65:16.34]Just stay right there, sir.
[65:18.82]I got baked yam and fish.
[65:29.08]Let's do 120.
[65:35.58]Thank you.
[65:43.24]Somebody buy the parade armor.
[65:44.52]Oh, here comes the rich girl.
[65:45.88]Oh, they have scarves, right.
[65:48.68]3,050.
[65:48.70]Overcharge.
[65:52.04]Let's do 1,4500?
[65:52.76]That's 147%.
[66:09.39]46?
[66:11.23]Dude, 200%.
[66:13.24]Really?
[66:13.60]I don't know if that's going to happen.
[66:17.14]That's ridiculous.
[66:19.06]She's going to walk out.
[66:25.73]I'm going to say 4,600.
[66:31.86]She didn't like that.
[66:33.10]She hated that, by the way.
[66:34.80]You guys want me to start at 200%?
[66:37.47]She hated that.
[66:38.95]I have to do like 4200 now.
[66:46.69]I have to sell it.
[66:48.21]I'm up against the clock.
[66:54.81]Somebody buy the parade armor.
[66:57.50]I'd like some food.
[67:04.11]Fuck.
[67:13.13]Oh, come on, man.
[67:15.17]Did you spend all your money?
[67:17.23]What did you spend your money on?
[67:23.81]Somebody buy the parade armor.
[67:29.53]I can do that.
[67:29.97]And it's gonna be really expensive.
[68:11.73]Thank you!
[68:13.39]That wasn't even fucking, come on!
[68:18.76]Are you serious?
[68:24.86]That was so, that was reasonable for a high demand item.
[68:39.88]Don't curse at your customers.
[68:42.32]Why not?
[68:42.70]I'm up against the clock again.
[68:50.38]It's happening again.
[68:52.31]Let's go to the pub.
[69:11.07]Oh, Charm, hello again.
[69:12.07]Here we go again.
[69:13.51]Oh, hello.
[69:14.95]Hello, Receipt.
[69:18.59]Pfffwa.
[69:19.53]Tears here too.
[69:21.61]Well, you have my deepest apologies for my continued existence.
[69:24.09]Oh, I can't take Receipt home with me if you're here.
[69:33.47]What?
[69:46.22]I cannot let you do anything of that, so I'm kidding.
[69:49.86]Yeesh.
[69:50.78]You guys are serious.
[69:52.02]Somebody call the police.
[70:01.70]Especially when you... I kind of wish I didn't go into the fucking pub, because I don't...
[70:22.93]Okay.
[70:24.13]Well, first of all, let's go back to the store.
[70:33.10]I'm just gonna sell what I have, and hopefully somebody buys it.
[70:36.20]And then tomorrow we go... to you-know-where.
[70:43.86]Murph!
[70:45.81]Oh, shit.
[70:47.67]Have you completed my order yet?
[70:50.11]Well, no, no, I don't have it, I don't have it, I don't have it, I don't have it.
[70:56.21]Well, nothing for it.
[70:57.37]And to be fair, some of those items are a bear.
[70:59.93]The slime livers from normal slimes are too small for starters.
[71:03.61]I need something from one that's bigger.
[71:06.07]Bat wings shouldn't be too hard if you hunt the eyeball bats, though.
[71:09.49]I've also heard that a gnolls and giant mice are found of charred lizards.
[71:14.23]I did this already.
[71:14.81]Get out of here.
[71:18.12]There it is.
[71:20.08]There it is!
[71:21.28]Alright, here we go.
[71:24.69]I'm gonna say, let's do 68.
[71:25.63]65, come on.
[71:25.91]Alright, 62.
[71:30.05]And then there's a bow.
[71:49.57]Thirty-five.
[71:50.05]Good blow.
[71:53.21]I need a hundred and fucking thirty thousand more dollars.
[71:57.01]I gotta get into that new dungeon.
[71:58.29]No, I don't... I think it's a twenty-four.
[72:09.92]Twenty-five.
[72:16.14]The dungeon's gonna save me, isn't it?
[72:23.55]Hey, it's me again.
[72:24.37]I decided to come by and sell you another yam that I come by and try to sell you every day.
[72:28.73]Thank you.
[72:56.93]Mmm, candy apples.
[72:59.07]I love candy apples.
[73:00.45]Alright, time for the dungeon.
[73:07.31]That's $17,000 a day.
[73:11.77]Alright, here we go.
[73:13.39]The price of metal items has increased.
[73:16.27]The price of daggers has normalized.
[73:21.74]Do I have anything like that?
[73:24.58]No.
[73:24.92]Alright, let's- I need to go into the new dungeon.
[73:27.52]We gotta get some new stuff.
[73:35.01]So by tomorrow I need two foodstuffs.
[73:38.39]I gotta- fuuuck.
[73:43.56]I need a big item.
[73:54.78]Alright, we got a level 8.
[73:56.05]I'm gonna stay with tried and true here.
[73:59.63]We're going with Louie.
[74:00.29]Let's get a couple of pieces of bread.
[74:07.63]This is uncharted territory here.
[74:15.93]Here we go.
[74:16.95]Amber Garden.
[74:21.30]We demand charm.
[74:23.04]Not when I need $140,000.
[74:29.86]Take charm.
[74:32.23]I need... She's level 8.
[74:34.11]She's got a rusty dagger.
[74:46.25]Buy a better one.
[74:47.71]No!
[74:47.97]No!
[74:55.41]Will she use?
[74:56.29]This is going to be a mistake, ain't it?
[75:02.97]No.
[75:04.72]I'm sorry, guys.
[75:05.32]I'm taking Lily.
[75:05.86]Okay.
[75:19.42]No, I will take charm when it's not absolutely necessary that I have to clear this.
[75:25.56]I don't... I don't even know what... Okay, I need these guys.
[75:34.13]By the way, she said, are you okay?
[75:39.85]I can speak Japanese.
[75:54.74]You learned that yesterday.
[75:58.55]So?
[75:59.79]If I learned a language yesterday, would that be a problem?
[76:10.35]What is that?
[76:10.89]That's like a new enemy.
[76:15.50]Ow.
[76:18.50]Ooh, hat!
[76:19.82]It's a cloth hat?
[76:20.62]Come on.
[76:28.02]Oh, some kind of new enemy.
[76:30.46]Ow.
[76:34.42]Fun fact, the items in the dungeons suck.
[76:37.88]But I need to get the materials to be able to make cool items.
[76:42.65]These guys are supposed to drop them.
[76:43.79]Those are the gnolls, right?
[76:55.07]Nothing over there?
[77:07.91]Same old enemies, a new dungeon.
[77:09.71]B-double-D-well.
[77:15.93]Shit.
[77:20.11]Are you alright?
[77:22.35]What does that mean?
[77:23.39]That means, are you... Are you good?
[77:26.95]It's, are you alright?
[77:27.63]And then she goes, are you good?
[77:31.65]Are you hurt?
[77:32.15]Nice, Batwing.
[77:41.06]I think I have as many of those as I need.
[77:43.00]Wait.
[77:47.92]Say W again, it's really nice.
[77:51.12]W. Watch out for the hand.
[78:01.83]Ooh, what's that?
[78:04.33]Gunpowder?
[78:06.99]I'm probably gonna use that in something.
[78:09.71]New item.
[78:18.36]Is the next room gonna be in JST instead of PST?
[78:23.51]Oh, is that supposed to be Japanese Standard Time?
[78:27.45]Is that what it's actually called?
[78:30.92]It's not Japanese Standard Time, is it?
[78:48.57]Movement speed increased for everyone.
[78:51.97]What?
[78:53.69]I actually... Can I keep this on permanently?
[78:55.67]Hey, I want this on forever.
[79:00.97]That's not a detriment to what I'm doing.
[79:02.29]That's a positive.
[79:09.56]I definitely have five bad ones.
[79:17.30]Mystery item.
[79:25.95]Come here.
[79:29.39]No, I'm not alright.
[79:31.27]I just had a bomb explode in my face.
[79:32.81]These, they drop the bread.
[79:34.53]I don't even want it.
[79:37.31]Yeah, I'm just going to eat it right now.
[79:51.79]God damn it.
[79:52.55]Say, what's that one?
[79:54.08]Daijo buh.
[79:55.72]What's buh?
[79:58.26]Are you alright?
[80:09.44]Ooh, an apple.
[80:11.86]First time I've seen that.
[80:17.87]It's an accent.
[80:18.73]Oh, okay.
[80:19.45]Hey, that's good to know.
[80:21.85]Alright, cool.
[80:26.61]Itchy eye, hold on.
[80:35.18]Shit.
[80:42.57]Toothpicks?
[80:45.27]What the fuck am I gonna do with these?
[80:57.61]One last spot I didn't see down here.
[80:59.01]Something good.
[81:02.61]That's wood.
[81:03.39]Ah, it's wood.
[81:08.20]Get those George Washington teeth out of here.
[81:10.38]I don't even want them.
[81:26.12]Alright, what are we on?
[81:27.25]Second floor, Amber Garden?
[81:35.73]We could just skip to the Latin now.
[81:39.79]And then I have to do the slime thing.
[81:41.63]Is that gonna waste so much time?
[81:47.30]I can't even get that guy's order.
[81:49.44]It's gonna be so... It's gonna take forever.
[82:10.24]Forget about the slime liver.
[82:13.92]Like, I need it, though.
[82:18.08]I'm gonna do some fusion.
[82:18.88]I'm gonna make some money.
[82:19.88]How much?
[82:23.51]I got 70,000.
[82:23.77]I need 200.
[82:42.06]Let's get rid of the bread.
[82:42.76]Bread is worthless.
[82:43.48]Alright, here we go.
[82:45.44]These guys drop new stuff.
[82:49.16]Gunpowder.
[82:49.82]Damn it.
[82:57.27]I don't think the gnoll has dropped one of the items that I need from the gnoll.
[83:06.41]Has it?
[83:09.35]All they drop is chestnuts.
[83:20.84]Magical staff.
[83:26.24]It's the charred lizard.
[83:27.18]I only have one.
[83:36.61]Watch out, he's gonna explode.
[83:53.60]Don't blow up, don't blow up.
[83:57.78]These levels are bigger.
[84:05.80]One chain.
[84:07.08]So somebody was saying, if I kill the same enemy in a row, just ignore everything else and just kill the enemy that I need to kill, there's a higher chance that it'll drop the thing that I want it to drop?
[84:18.09]So just run around and only kill the gnolls.
[84:19.83]Well, etc.
[84:23.31]Apparently.
[84:24.09]So it seems.
[84:24.77]Huh.
[84:25.41]Alright.
[84:37.42]News.
[84:37.78]Adventurer attack power doubled.
[84:42.40]Well, that's pretty convenient.
[84:44.86]Maybe I shouldn't leave.
[84:49.30]What's that?
[84:49.84]Rusty?
[84:53.98]Okay, inkwell.
[84:54.92]That's a part of a... That's part of a recipe.
[85:02.07]Don't ever leave, yeah.
[85:03.19]I'm just gonna keep going down.
[85:06.49]Why would I leave?
[85:07.15]That felt pretty good.
[85:18.60]Watch this, ready?
[85:19.88]Three, four.
[85:21.79]Two chain.
[85:22.35]I can see the shadows.
[85:32.21]Ow.
[85:32.79]No, don't.
[85:36.23]Come on.
[85:39.25]What's that, a jacket?
[85:41.11]Another windbreaker.
[85:42.17]The windbreakers are stupid.
[85:45.41]Everything's stupid.
[85:56.54]You're stupid.
[85:57.54]I'm not stupid.
[86:00.64]This is level 18.
[86:09.62]Ow.
[86:17.07]Honey.
[86:19.07]I think I need three honeys, right?
[86:21.25]Oh, this is where it gets fucked up.
[86:22.45]Alright, I need three honeys.
[86:23.77]Let's eat the cherry.
[86:30.65]I'm almost gonna have enough to make a bunch of stuff.
[86:38.25]Snow, come on.
[86:41.68]This is the cherry, but I... I need bigger bags.
[86:47.94]I can just get rid of the... Get rid of the bread.
[87:01.36]Yeah, I'm at that point where I have to start eliminating the least expensive thing here.
[87:11.77]God damn it.
[87:13.85]Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
[87:14.81]It's a bad thing.
[87:20.78]Does the candy restore its SP?
[87:29.14]I'm curious to see how close I am to two or three people.
[87:34.58]I'm gonna miss this double damage when it's gone on the next floor.
[87:44.27]If it even does leave.
[87:51.39]Can I dash by double tapping?
[87:54.01]No.
[87:55.29]You're on a fixed speed.
[88:00.34]Chest.
[88:04.58]Whoa, gunpowder, good.
[88:06.98]Can you make a gun?
[88:07.98]Or explosives or something?
[88:12.74]I'm almost level 19, so I'm gonna get... Mmm... 1,200, that's pretty good.
[88:21.03]This thing's a piece of crap, but I can sell it for something stupid.
[88:23.93]How much is the windbreaker?
[88:24.75]500.
[88:24.89]Let's get rid of the chest, not...
[88:38.35]What is this game?
[88:39.17]This is called... An Item Shop's Tale.
[88:48.53]I could be saying that wrong.
[88:50.29]I've probably been mispronouncing this the whole entire game, so... Wouldn't surprise me.
[88:57.51]Is it on sale for $5?
[88:59.67]I'll go get it.
[89:01.47]This is, what is it, $4.99?
[89:03.13]Just go buy it.
[89:03.77]Like, why would you not?
[89:21.36]I mean, you have to gauge... Alright, where's the boss?
[89:24.28]Sometimes you have to gauge the value of something based on if it's more money for you to go get, like, a double cheeseburger from McDonald's.
[89:38.27]Oh, shit.
[89:38.83]This guy's kind of... Uh-oh.
[89:42.15]Uh-oh.
[89:42.93]Uh-oh.
[89:48.05]Oh, shit.
[89:48.77]I gotta eat food.
[89:55.74]And eat the apple.
[90:05.81]Don't do it.
[90:12.37]Shit.
[90:15.55]Shit.
[90:16.61]Shit.
[90:18.83]Do I know I can't?
[90:19.61]Alright, calm down.
[90:32.83]Oh shit.
[90:37.07]Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[90:40.51]Got it.
[90:54.14]I freaked out.
[90:59.32]I didn't even, no chest or anything.
[91:06.53]Should I just keep going?
[91:08.76]No.
[91:11.70]No, no, no, no, no.
[91:13.52]I can't.
[91:14.18]I have to sell stuff.
[91:15.26]I need money.
[91:16.72]I'm not going.
[91:23.73]I have enough to do some fusions here.
[91:27.05]Alright, hold on a second.
[91:30.29]Fusions.
[91:31.72]Fusions.
[91:33.57]Rank 1 Steph.
[91:35.21]I need a backscratcher.
[91:37.74]Where the hell can I get a backscratcher?
[91:38.96]Didn't I have one?
[91:47.56]Hat?
[91:49.62]I need some... Okay.
[91:52.22]Can I craft a back... Okay, I can make another one of these.
[91:54.84]Toothpicks.
[91:59.12]Toothpicks.
[92:02.99]This is like $15,000 to $16,000.
[92:09.67]But I can't because I need to give that to the dude.
[92:15.60]Alright, so I need fur balls.
[92:17.04]I can get the... So can I... Can I buy a backscratcher?
[92:22.96]This is probably going to be worth a lot of money.
[92:24.32]Backscratcher.
[92:26.66]Backscratcher.
[92:36.18]Where am I gonna get a backscratcher?
[92:51.34]Well, there's the... Yeah, I can get this, but I still need the fur.
[92:56.53]So, I can go back and go get, like, the fur from, like, the first few floors.
[92:59.21]Floors 11 to 15?
[93:02.09]Yeah.
[93:05.60]So let me get this.
[93:15.16]I need a backscratcher.
[93:20.12]And I need three furballs.
[93:28.43]Alright.
[93:30.63]I can't do this today.
[93:34.32]But might as well just do this event, because it's flashing.
[93:39.82]Furballs are easy, yeah.
[93:43.98]I heard there's a girl here who's been handing out advice to people lately.
[93:48.56]Advice?
[93:48.90]Well, that would not be very surprising for a fortune teller as such, but here in the pub, apparently she can clear up any problem you have in seconds.
[93:56.11]Kind of wonder who it is.
[93:59.48]Oh, it's me.
[94:00.72]Haha.
[94:01.39]I wish I got... I wish I got why this was happening.
[94:06.39]Alright, alright.
[94:07.11]Slow down World of Warcraft filter when you take three drinks.
[94:13.74]Oh, excuse me.
[94:14.60]Yeah, you have to be... Will you hear me out?
[94:18.36]Oh, yes.
[94:18.74]I'll listen.
[94:19.30]Go ahead.
[94:21.82]My wife terrifies me so much at this point that I can't even look at alcohol without feeling guilty.
[94:26.21]Help!
[94:27.94]Ah, women are easy to handle.
[94:29.04]I should know, right?
[94:31.50]Just do little things that keep her happy.
[94:33.70]That'll solve your problems.
[94:35.40]Yeah, aha, that makes sense.
[94:37.00]I'll try that out.
[94:37.70]Thanks.
[94:37.88]I mean, a lot of people like that lately.
[94:42.88]Wonder why.
[94:43.38]I didn't lose a slice for that one, did I?
[94:49.55]Alright, what do I got?
[94:53.61]I need 130,000.
[95:06.38]I feel like... I still have a lot of stuff on sale.
[95:13.87]Didn't I... No, somebody already bought this.
[95:15.27]Alright, let's do it.
[95:24.11]Get the sword up there.
[95:25.07]Let's get... No, I need all this.
[95:32.16]I have to start to sell these rings.
[95:35.29]The same shit happened last time.
[95:38.67]I have to sell them!
[95:53.52]Oh, I am in a lot of trouble.
[96:00.56]I'm not gonna save over that.
[96:01.54]I'm saving down here.
[96:03.32]Just in case this is a disaster.
[96:07.10]I'm gonna... I gotta put him out.
[96:11.15]I have to make some money here.
[96:13.63]Don't sell the rings.
[96:14.23]They're not half price.
[96:34.92]Sell the honey?
[96:35.56]No, I need the honey for a fusion.
[96:38.30]And then I gotta go back and get fur, and then I gotta get a backscratcher.
[96:45.19]The half price!
[96:47.07]Yeah, but I got them for like 5,000.
[96:49.51]I can only really afford to do this for like one more day.
[97:04.97]I need the bat wings for the fusion.
[97:06.67]I could put, like, anti-venom out here.
[97:10.12]Need to hold and have faith.
[97:16.36]Toothpicks are worth nothing.
[97:17.65]Gunpowder is part of... No, I can't.
[97:20.11]Who's coming in today?
[97:20.85]Anybody coming in at the end of the day?
[97:24.03]Tomorrow, two foodstuffs.
[97:25.45]Okay.
[97:35.24]No, I need all this shit.
[97:36.30]I can put the armband up here.
[97:43.26]Buy more rings?
[97:45.52]Do not give me ideas like that.
[97:47.10]There's a lot of good memories tied to this.
[98:08.02]Is there a way I can put, like, a sign on the door that says, I don't want your stuff?
[98:11.55]There's a lot of good memories tied to this cherry.
[98:19.77]Okay, so... I'll just sell it for 400.
[98:23.92]Okay.
[98:33.41]When she died, my grandmother told me to sell this.
[98:36.69]If I ever got into trouble.
[98:40.71]I'm sorry.
[98:50.22]Now I actually am getting scammed.
[98:55.02]There we go.
[98:55.48]140.
[98:55.50]It is that much.
[99:05.69]Once I get these fusions, I'll have a ton of money.
[99:08.49]Alright, I want the Windbreaker.
[99:11.37]120.
[99:20.86]I just need the right fusion.
[99:22.82]I really, really need two hats.
[99:24.60]I need them in two days.
[99:25.42]I can do that.
[99:30.78]Accept defeat.
[99:31.94]No, I'm not gonna accept defeat.
[99:34.58]I have two or three fusions and those items are gonna be worth like twenty to thirty thousand dollars each.
[99:41.38]I'm not gonna... I'll be fine.
[99:47.25]The chilly season is here.
[99:48.89]Those sensitive to cold should bundle up.
[99:52.41]The price of accessories has normalized.
[99:54.85]Alright.
[99:56.45]You know what that means, right?
[100:00.27]That means it's time to sell.
[100:02.49]See, they were 50% off.
[100:15.16]Let's get that bracelet up here.
[100:18.92]Alright.
[100:22.72]Let's get some of these necklaces.
[100:30.19]Make the fusion cape with the inkwell?
[100:32.35]Well, if I do that, then I lose out on this dude's order, but... Alright, I have to adventure.
[100:38.41]Let me see exactly what I need.
[100:39.93]There.
[100:53.21]Just the good shit.
[100:57.72]So.
[100:59.52]I need to do... I could just open the store now.
[101:02.70]Or should I go... Let me see.
[101:04.64]Because if I... I'd lose a slice of time.
[101:07.00]How many days do I have?
[101:10.96]It's like three days.
[101:12.18]I'm gonna lose.
[101:17.48]I'm gonna lose.
[101:29.15]It's you again.
[101:29.93]I don't have your order.
[101:31.41]I'm sorry!
[101:36.08]Bingo.
[101:39.78]I'm going... 3400.
[101:43.46]Just a little bit less.
[101:46.06]3300!
[101:46.32]Take it!
[101:53.07]Treasures.
[101:53.75]Buy them.
[101:54.79]Don't want... I hope you don't want something in the window.
[102:00.61]Go away.
[102:17.30]I don't want to buy any more stuff from you.
[102:20.48]Please.
[102:21.18]It's 600.
[102:21.62]That's it.
[102:23.06]Mommy would get mad.
[102:29.59]I've come to get my foodstuffs.
[102:31.29]Oh, shit.
[102:34.67]I got it, okay.
[102:37.39]Baked yam and a, uh, cherry.
[102:48.56]One... One-thirty.
[102:51.46]One-thirty percent.
[102:53.74]Little bit less.
[102:54.72]Uh, one... Alright, thirty-six hundred.
[103:05.80]Somebody buy the rings.
[103:07.52]What can I get you?
[103:11.37]The adventurer is coming in to get the chocolate.
[103:16.49]I don't know what this guy's deal is.
[103:25.20]Somebody buy a ring.
[103:29.54]I can always rely on you to come in here and just be an absolute moron.
[103:36.66]6,000.
[103:36.68]7,000.
[103:36.70]6,200.
[103:36.72]Alright, ugh.
[103:37.16]Oh, damn it!
[104:06.64]I'm in a lot of trouble here.
[104:08.00]Okay, I can't afford to... I have to do the adventuring.
[104:14.80]I need to go find these items.
[104:19.46]So, let me see what I gotta do here.
[104:22.22]Merchant's Guild, Fusion.
[104:26.27]I need... What do I need?
[104:29.39]A Backscratcher.
[104:34.38]Three Fur Balls.
[104:35.92]Okay?
[104:36.64]Three Fur Balls.
[104:39.12]Should I just make this stupid thing?
[104:40.96]And that guy will forever.
[104:47.23]He's gonna just keep coming to the store.
[104:48.55]I can get another Blizzard.
[104:52.97]Just do it.
[104:53.59]Fuck the Redditor.
[104:55.64]What do you mean the Redditor?
[105:00.12]I'm doing it.
[105:01.96]I have to.
[105:02.36]I'm gonna lose.
[105:03.84]I need to make money.
[105:08.35]Three furballs.
[105:11.87]One cloth cape.
[105:18.71]Let me get the cloth cape.
[105:32.43]I'm gonna do... I'm gonna pull this out of my ass.
[105:39.21]10,000.
[105:45.86]I'm not gonna be able to make this one, unfortunately.
[105:47.68]Not yet.
[105:49.46]But I will be able to do this one.
[105:52.24]Three furballs.
[105:53.50]Now where am I... What's the absolute best way to get those?
[106:00.51]Or one more honey.
[106:03.94]One Honey, one Backscratcher, the Rabbits.
[106:12.49]Three Fur Balls, one Backscratcher, one Honey.
[106:15.79]I'm going for it.
[106:24.15]Jade Way, and it was what?
[106:27.76]Floor like 6 to 10?
[106:29.44]Floor 11 to 15?
[106:37.25]The rabbits were in the very beginning, weren't they?
[106:38.75]Just do them all.
[106:45.02]I'm gonna have to do a full tour, yeah?
[106:49.06]I'm going.
[106:49.96]Let's start at the very beginning.
[106:51.12]Welcome to hell.
[107:05.24]I need rabbits.
[107:07.71]Oh, it's this person again.
[107:10.43]Can you accidentally drop $50,000?
[107:11.59]Hi again.
[107:24.13]Oh my, hello.
[107:24.75]Have we met somewhere?
[107:25.47]Oh yeah, in a way that's given me a whole lot of deja vu.
[107:30.62]Is that right?
[107:31.00]I'm sorry that I don't remember.
[107:32.04]I take it you are again here by mistake while attempting to get home.
[107:38.38]I'm not quite sure I... Wait, am I... I'm somehow not surprised that you did not realize where you were.
[107:42.96]I was just heading home from the market with dinner.
[107:52.09]See, I even have my scallions with me.
[107:53.71]Scallions, I think I could use those.
[107:56.61]Those look great!
[107:57.25]So perfectly green and tasty!
[107:59.79]Ah, it was quite a good purchase.
[108:03.45]Thank you for buying those for us!
[108:07.85]Wait, I was buying them for you?
[108:09.35]Yes, you were!
[108:10.29]Of course you were.
[108:12.69]I think something more than your sense of direction is off.
[108:15.11]I think I'll have sukiyaki for dinner tonight.
[108:19.97]Sukiyaki?
[108:20.71]I don't know what that is, but it sounds good!
[108:23.58]Can we fix sukiyami for dinner tonight?
[108:28.12]Grain porridge.
[108:30.00]Ever.
[108:30.76]End.
[108:31.76]And on.
[108:33.76]Aww.
[108:34.96]I enjoy your company, you two.
[108:36.04]I must get home, however.
[108:37.06]Stay safe.
[108:45.76]Raincoat.
[108:47.22]I'm not picking up any of this shit.
[108:48.86]I gotta find rabbits and chain them together.
[108:50.42]Alright, where are the rabbits?
[108:52.32]Only kill rabbits.
[108:53.38]Rabbit!
[108:54.21]Only kill rabbits.
[109:02.25]More rabbits!
[109:02.93]Where are they?
[109:06.16]I know there's more rabbits.
[109:13.76]Come on.
[109:15.52]If I sell all these items that I make right now, that's like $45,000, $50,000.
[109:18.66]I'll... It'll be close, but I'll get there.
[109:23.94]Any more rabbits up here?
[109:25.92]Oh, give me a break.
[109:41.07]It's wabbit season.
[109:45.05]No, no more of these coats!
[109:54.46]Duck season!
[109:56.12]Wabbit season!
[109:58.70]Duck season!
[110:03.24]What a classic cartoon comedy.
[110:08.37]debt season.
[110:11.07]No, no, I'm not going to leave.
[110:13.25]Because look, they just respawn.
[110:15.09]I'm just going to game this completely.
[110:17.41]I'm just going to walk around the circle until I chain like 30 of them together.
[110:21.62]This is going to be one rider.
[110:33.72]Damn it.
[110:38.30]I still need 120,000.
[110:40.24]Look, if I liquidate my entire inventory, I'll be able to do it.
[110:46.24]That strategy's not going to work.
[110:47.83]Let's go.
[110:50.91]Rabbits.
[110:51.85]Oh, a lot of them.
[110:53.03]Come on.
[110:53.43]Yes!
[110:53.83]Alright.
[110:54.25]I need two more of these.
[110:55.17]I do have 15 floors to work with.
[111:00.22]That's true.
[111:05.61]Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit.
[111:08.61]Hey, did you guys know that if you wake up on the first day of spring and say rabbit, rabbit, it gives you good luck forever?
[111:22.94]That's not bullshit.
[111:23.93]Like, that's an actual, like, folk tale thing.
[111:27.07]That's not, that wasn't a joke.
[111:28.61]I was actually saying that.
[111:29.99]Like, that's a, just a perception of something that was told.
[111:36.57]Well, I'm out of things to hit.
[111:42.88]Let me try to get some more items.
[111:52.61]Was that on your Facebook page?
[111:53.91]No, actually, it was on, like, Nickelodeon one time.
[111:58.35]It was one of the in-between advertisements.
[112:01.79]From, like, Doug to Ren and Stimpy.
[112:04.73]I actually think, like, Stick Stickly said it.
[112:21.18]Ooh, gimme... ready?
[112:29.94]How is that not a chain?
[112:34.55]Alright.
[112:40.07]One more, and I can make it.
[112:56.93]A lot of gnolls.
[113:00.07]Nobody dropped anything.
[113:00.97]Dammit.
[113:06.05]If you crit, it should be a guaranteed item.
[113:17.44]I think I came back up here.
[113:18.54]Done.
[113:23.85]But that doesn't mean we are done, because I still need a Backscratcher and I still need Honey.
[113:33.78]Not even chaining Omega Lull, and I still did it.
[113:44.89]Slime Liver.
[113:46.19]Wait, any more of these guys?
[113:56.57]A pendant.
[114:00.41]Looks like the backscratcher are from chests or the rat boss.
[114:06.43]That doesn't leave me with very many options, does it?
[114:12.31]You can still get higher grade furball, yeah.
[114:19.80]What were the other items that I needed?
[114:22.12]From, um...
[114:26.23]There we go.
[114:26.87]Furball.
[114:31.47]The honey drops from... Another lizard, too.
[114:35.31]Yeah.
[114:42.12]Thanks for the boost.
[114:42.68]I'll take it.
[114:45.88]Honey drops from the bees, I'm assuming, right?
[114:55.33]No lizards.
[115:03.69]Backscrafter in here, come on.
[115:16.54]The honey is really, really expensive too, so whatever I get out of there better be good.
[115:23.17]Whatever the crafting is.
[115:28.83]Backscrafter.
[115:29.81]What?
[115:30.13]Is it corn?
[115:32.51]They say corn on the cob.
[115:44.50]Another rabbit down here.
[115:45.36]That's what's killed us.
[115:49.94]Alright, let's see if I can get the big slime.
[115:58.76]Drop it.
[116:00.36]Drop it.
[116:00.74]What?
[116:12.04]What was that hitbox?
[116:15.57]Give it to me.
[116:16.45]Is that it?
[116:17.67]I think that's it.
[116:18.15]Is that... Slime Lover!
[116:21.67]I got it!
[116:22.05]Okay, okay, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[116:29.35]I wonder how much that was sells for just normally I'm so happy that I got that
[116:59.39]You are a winner.
[117:02.35]So far.
[117:06.96]I'm trying to go too fast.
[117:14.52]Save it for the re- Why do you guys keep calling that guy a Redditor?
[117:19.13]Is that just going way over my head?
[117:21.03]Why is he a Redditor?
[117:31.12]He feels like a Redditor.
[117:38.21]I don't know what that means.
[117:40.35]He feels like a Redditor.
[117:42.28]This is worth 6,300 bucks.
[117:55.58]I didn't know that you could classify somebody... like that.
[118:00.12]That's not a bad- That's a long bow.
[118:02.52]I'm getting some good items down here.
[118:05.58]I don't want that.
[118:08.82]Backscratcher.
[118:10.86]Damn it.
[118:20.19]That's because you don't identify as a Redditor.
[118:21.77]You don't understand.
[118:26.06]No, I don't.
[118:26.44]I don't understand.
[118:29.28]Bingo!
[118:32.08]And you didn't think I was gonna get to 200,000.
[118:44.35]I still don't.
[118:45.41]But anyways, what I was trying to say is... How does... I don't know how you identify yourself as reading, like, the news from a website.
[118:56.90]I don't understand.
[119:07.61]News.
[119:08.73]He only reads the news.
[119:13.39]I don't know.
[119:13.81]What do you do on Reddit?
[119:17.66]Besides read the news.
[119:28.62]Boots!
[119:36.01]Any more rabbits?
[119:37.33]Who the fuck?
[119:38.03]What are you guys doing down here?
[119:44.15]Oh, receipt!
[119:44.97]What a coincidence meeting you here.
[119:51.08]I identify as a Wall Street journaler.
[119:57.54]How are you, Alouette?
[119:59.00]Oh, you're dungeon crawling as well, I see.
[120:01.42]And with such a seedy-looking adventurer.
[120:05.04]My adventurer friend isn't seedy-looking, and we did this joke already.
[120:11.67]Self-aware, I like it.
[120:13.65]I suppose a seedy adventurer is appropriate for a seedy merchant.
[120:20.57]Anyone else feel like that was backwards?
[120:22.41]That if you play that in reverse, it'll sound like a regular laugh?
[120:25.81]That's how they do that, right?
[120:32.42]Well, come on, everyone!
[120:33.40]Don't bother picking up the inexpensive garbage!
[120:35.61]Only the best for us!
[120:37.91]It'd be so funny if, like, this thing just grabbed her.
[120:45.15]And just, like, punched her in the face.
[120:48.98]You have, like, four adventurers!
[120:52.68]That's stupid.
[120:53.84]That's not fair.
[121:19.13]He knew.
[121:33.52]Any more of those gnolls?
[121:34.50]No.
[121:35.16]Might as well get a double.
[121:40.20]You'll never understand the struggles of a Redditor.
[121:42.10]Go back to 4chan.
[122:00.10]Floor 8.
[122:00.34]Let's go.
[122:05.52]What'd she say?
[122:07.33]I need my, like, I need my, like, Redditors to translate that for me.
[122:11.29]Ooh, a bag, a sack of gold!
[122:14.09]Nut mix.
[122:31.39]Did I invest in Bitcoin?
[122:35.56]I don't... I don't even know what that is.
[122:36.78]I've heard of that before.
[122:37.48]Just get out of my way thing.
[122:57.03]I do like this little item run though.
[123:09.31]I know that it was... It was like a scam, right?
[123:17.66]That's all I remember.
[123:19.26]It was like a scam or something, right?
[123:24.80]That's what somebody in the office told me.
[123:26.72]I need to get rid of something.
[123:40.95]What do I get rid of?
[123:41.53]Everything I have... The raincoats?
[123:43.45]The raincoats are shitty.
[123:50.26]I have... I need the furballs.
[123:53.42]The insect traps.
[123:54.72]The nut mix is a thousand.
[123:56.74]I'm just gonna eat the chocolate.
[124:02.20]Backscratcher.
[124:04.02]I mean, that's still pretty good.
[124:09.66]I have one extra, but what if I need it?
[124:23.15]Why is Jerma such a Redditor?
[124:24.37]It's freaking me out.
[124:27.35]I don't even know what you're talking about.
[124:33.86]This is so over my head.
[124:35.26]It's freaking me out.
[124:49.64]Why do you eat like a Redditor?
[125:03.87]No, I don't want this.
[125:09.99]I have one extra furball, but I'm probably going to need it if I want to ever do this again.
[125:15.63]Should I... Get rid of this charm.
[125:22.15]Backscratcher.
[125:24.65]Fuck.
[125:28.86]Please do the nice girl laugh.
[125:35.98]Get rid of the shitty furball.
[125:37.72]But I might need it.
[125:40.81]If I get enough of those furballs, I can make two.
[125:55.22]Two!
[125:55.78]Count them!
[125:56.26]Two!
[125:57.70]Two!
[125:58.14]Two!
[126:04.74]Triple kill.
[126:05.44]I need a lizard too.
[126:09.11]Lizard.
[126:09.83]Lizard.
[126:10.31]No lizard.
[126:12.73]Bullshit.
[126:13.29]I don't want the cherry.
[126:22.75]Maybe I'll get it from the rat.
[126:26.75]I can't carry anymore.
[126:30.03]Wooden shield.
[126:31.05]Garbage.
[126:32.01]Raincoat.
[126:32.61]Garbage.
[126:37.04]Uh, brah.
[126:37.60]I don't need a brah.
[126:39.00]I'm gonna throw it away.
[126:44.13]Alright, I'll get rid of one for a ball.
[126:47.33]And the brah.
[126:50.35]It's 800 bucks, though.
[127:05.83]I can't.
[127:06.35]I can't!
[127:08.37]I can't.
[127:08.91]I need... Here we go.
[127:16.61]Backscratcher from the rat!
[127:20.19]Here comes Ratwheel.
[127:34.56]Oops, I forgot you could do that.
[127:36.92]Eat, eat, eat.
[127:39.62]Oh, that is a heal.
[127:40.58]Remember I contemplated if that was going to be a heal?
[127:45.46]Eat one.
[128:04.86]Eat it!
[128:06.39]Stop making me contemplate.
[128:08.81]Alright.
[128:27.00]Backscraper, do it!
[128:28.30]Come on, please!
[128:29.32]I need this!
[128:29.94]I need this.
[128:35.14]Well, I got... Okay.
[128:37.16]I did get another charred lizard.
[128:41.40]So... What was the last thing I needed for that stupid order?
[128:53.13]I needed the lizard.
[128:55.38]I needed the bat wing.
[128:57.06]I got it.
[128:59.74]It's probably going to be a shitload of money, isn't it?
[129:04.72]Okay, it may be time to call it a day here.
[129:08.54]Because I'm running out of room.
[129:20.43]Yeah, it's time to go.
[129:23.57]No, not the stream.
[129:24.33]I'm talking about the run.
[129:26.97]Yeah, I gotta go back.
[129:27.85]I gotta... Here.
[129:31.67]I gotta... Oh, you know what I'm saying?
[129:33.39]Okay.
[129:37.29]This is my last shop these next couple days.
[129:49.00]Alright.
[129:53.20]News.
[129:55.80]The price of food has decreased.
[129:58.82]The price of swords has normalized.
[130:01.04]Whatever.
[130:04.66]So, fusion time.
[130:10.22]I have 48 hours.
[130:14.08]Time for fusion.
[130:15.68]First of all, the dude's gonna come back.
[130:22.66]I have it all.
[130:24.47]And then I need two hats for today as well.
[130:28.07]Here we go.
[130:32.45]Fusion.
[130:34.73]Rank 1 staff.
[130:36.65]I don't have the backscratcher required, but I have the other stuff.
[130:39.66]I need a sturdy glove.
[130:44.36]So that's one there.
[130:49.38]Okay.
[130:50.36]Ready?
[130:50.64]This took a long time to make.
[131:02.53]It's a 4th of July hat, and it's $3,800.
[131:07.26]Wonderful.
[131:18.54]Okay, I need a sturdy glove.
[131:27.02]Shit, better be worth it.
[131:34.87]Like 15, at least.
[131:39.16]No, 3850.
[131:40.96]That's nothing.
[131:46.48]Shit.
[131:50.21]I'm in trouble now.
[132:01.51]I could have just sold the three honey for like 8,000.
[132:31.84]It's gonna be close!
[132:40.20]Just put only expensive shit up here.
[132:43.69]Nothing else.
[132:59.74]But what if he comes back?
[133:02.19]Okay, if he comes back... What if he gives me a ton of money?
[133:07.03]What if he's like a trillionaire or something?
[133:08.99]Alright, here we go.
[133:17.64]I only have the expensive shit up.
[133:28.14]I need these two hats.
[133:30.34]Because this is going to be an extremely expensive two hats for that lady.
[133:34.49]I don't want to put them out.
[133:38.53]There's a lady coming in today that wants two hats.
[133:49.24]Fuck.
[133:49.46]Let's go.
[134:02.75]Welcome to... Alright.
[134:04.55]There he is!
[134:05.97]Okay.
[134:06.87]Like, 50 grand!
[134:08.55]Did you finally manage to get my order?
[134:09.89]I did!
[134:11.97]Is your laugh supposed to creep out the customers?
[134:14.06]Or is that just what he... Give me some money.
[134:15.52]Look, and you got like a prince cape on.
[134:17.06]You have like an outfit on.
[134:17.96]You have a big collar.
[134:18.80]That means you're like Dracula or you're a prince.
[134:21.68]That has a lot of money.
[134:22.72]Either one.
[134:23.40]Dracula also probably has a lot of money.
[134:27.88]What in the name of da-da-da have you no shame?
[134:32.66]You're not happy?
[134:34.04]Given how long I had to wait for this.
[134:37.90]Well, whatever.
[134:38.50]I did put in the order.
[134:40.16]And I... Sorry.
[134:42.25]And I do still need these.
[134:44.05]So I'll go ahead and take them now.
[134:45.57]Here's the fee.
[134:48.59]Thank the owner for me.
[134:49.63]Despite the delay, I do appreciate the help.
[134:51.47]How much money is it?
[134:53.63]I told you, I am the owner.
[134:55.79]I don't care how much money.
[134:57.79]You really don't know when to give up on a prank, do you?
[135:00.72]In any event, you do need to learn to deal with customers better.
[135:03.80]I'll be coming in here more often from now on, so expect good service.
[135:08.18]What's the fee?
[135:10.68]I can deal with normal customers just fine, thank you.
[135:15.82]What was it?
[135:16.86]Was it $3,800?
[135:17.18]That's it?
[135:18.00]That's it.
[135:18.94]It's over.
[135:19.69]I lose.
[135:21.67]I was really riding on that being at least $20.
[135:23.07]Okay.
[135:31.45]34,000.
[135:32.45]It's in high demand.
[135:33.23]It's a hot item.

[154:09.08]I'm afraid this amount of money is insufficient.
[154:10.84]I'm sorry, but as an agent of Termi Finance, I must now seize this house in order to repay the outstanding debt.
[154:30.37]And so, the cute, courageous little heroine was crushed by the cruel bitterness of reality.
[154:37.11]Wow, why'd it have to end in a box?
[154:40.47]This is a dream, right?
[154:51.44]This must be a joke.
[154:52.48]If I did not know anybody, I'd say you were in a coma.
[154:56.22]Huh?
[154:57.38]I'm asleep.
[154:58.18]Mmm, tear was just a dream, I guess.
[154:59.68]That dream seems so real, though.
[155:00.90]I thought I mean I liked, uh... Mmm, pillow.
[155:07.63]Would you wake up, please?
[155:12.03]I didn't shoot the sheriff, I swear!
[155:13.45]You're right, I... I don't remember.

[156:33.67]So what do I do now?
[156:38.97]What?
[156:41.76]Why am I getting this all over again?
[156:51.62]Okay, we did this already.
[156:57.68]You keep your levels and your stuff, but you don't keep money.
[157:07.15]Oh, so you're supposed to lose.
[157:22.02]Save scum and buy everything.
[157:29.93]Did it go drop like $150,000?
[157:41.94]Well, I'll at least be able to pay off the debt.
[157:45.72]What about like advent- hold on.

[158:31.52]Where were we, right here?
[158:35.43]I just want to check something.
[158:50.29]You keep everything but money.
[158:51.57]I just want to see if this is possible.
[158:55.17]Just out of curiosity.
[159:51.81]No.
[159:54.65]No, it's not even close.
[159:59.06]Fuck.
[160:00.40]Well, we're going to have to do it.

[160:46.02]Hold on.
[160:46.44]I don't have any bracelets.

[161:00.17]Watch me actually do it this time somehow.
[161:01.91]Okay.

[161:14.95]Yeah, it's true.
[161:24.17]I will buy... How about this?
[161:25.19]I'm going to go buy the most expensive weapons.
[161:30.80]Oh, your mom told you to come sell this.
[161:32.42]No thanks.
[161:35.72]That is tactical gaming.
[161:36.84]You're right.
[161:43.37]Get out of here.
[161:58.99]The game's designed to kick the shit out of you in your first run.
[162:02.09]You're supposed to optimize for the second run.
[162:04.21]Alright, okay.
[162:08.15]The price of weapons has decreased, and look at that, guys.

[171:13.48]Alright, let's get something good up here.
[171:20.83]Let's get... What do I want up there?
[171:26.65]Popular charm?
[171:28.29]I think... May I speak with you?
[171:32.37]What do you want?
[171:33.29]Is this more tutorial shit?
[171:34.48]Yeah, we already know this.
[171:39.92]Make the whole shop longswords.
[171:42.56]No, because if... I'm not going to do... That's a pretty funny thing.
[171:46.20]But once weapons become valuable, we make $5,000 a pop.
[171:49.25]Yeah, I'm not going to put any of these out.
[171:57.87]I'll put some robes out here, maybe.
[171:59.49]A couple of cloth robe.
[172:00.98]Maybe some iron armor.
[172:05.84]And maybe a shield.
[172:08.26]I'm ready.
[172:08.62]Let's make some cash.
[172:18.04]I'd like a treasure, please.
[172:19.22]Do I have any of those?
[172:22.92]I don't have any treasures.
[172:27.80]Come on.
[172:29.20]No, I don't.
[172:31.18]No treasures.
[172:31.68]Sorry.
[172:38.99]Sell him a ring.
[172:39.57]He got really mad last time I did that.
[172:41.81]Bracelet.
[172:42.27]I got lots of those.
[172:45.64]Do you want... I'm gonna... No.
[172:48.80]Take an iron one.
[172:54.62]You're a pain in the ass, so we'll do 690.
[172:55.78]Did I pay the $200,000 back?
[172:56.34]I did not.
[173:00.12]In fact, I had to restart...
[173:11.87]What happens is when you lose in this game, you start from the beginning and keep all your stuff.
[173:17.40]I have hats.
[173:21.02]Warm hat?
[173:21.60]No, cloth hat.
[173:23.44]I'll sell the other one for much more.
[173:25.00]900.
[173:35.85]What the hell is that?
[173:36.87]I think you'll like this.
[173:38.19]Teacher's pole?
[173:44.55]I'll take it.
[173:48.47]I'll give you two grand for that.
[173:49.67]Mmm.
[173:54.14]Alright.
[173:54.50]Okay.
[173:54.80]Alright.
[173:55.18]I'll give you 20.
[173:56.28]I want this.
[173:58.12]I'll give you 3,000 for it.
[174:10.46]People are posting important tips you're missing.
[174:13.40]In the corners?
[174:13.94]What do you mean in the corners?
[174:17.36]Don't haggle.
[174:18.08]It ruins your combo.
[174:21.20]Well, I also want money.
[174:27.14]Let's put that poll right out.
[174:28.42]6,000.
[174:29.30]Combo is more important.
[174:37.46]Go recruit Louie.
[174:38.72]Hold on.
[174:44.11]Don't listen to these idiots.
[174:45.53]Haggle for max cash.
[174:50.77]If you get someone to buy it on the first try, it builds a combo.
[174:52.85]High combos give more experience.
[174:59.38]Alright.
[175:07.64]One more.
[175:12.92]My wife asked me to get a weapon.
[175:15.44]I can help you out here.
[175:17.44]That's it?
[175:17.84]How much?
[175:19.98]So when you say don't haggle, you're talking about just sell it for 1200.
[175:23.94]Or do you mean just make sure that they take it first try?
[175:35.31]Make sure it's first try.
[175:36.35]Okay.
[175:38.25]I mean, this guy, this is, he'll take it at 1400.
[175:43.87]Okay, make sure they take it first try.
[175:46.23]I'll go for it.
[175:48.78]I want to get two foodstuffs and I want them in two days.
[175:51.78]I can do that.
[175:56.26]Go to Walmart and stream this experience.
[175:58.08]What do you need?
[176:01.67]There it is.
[176:02.63]Been looking for one of these.
[176:05.51]Now, do I care about the combo right now or do I want like 20 grand?
[176:13.48]I think a first try would be, like, 18.
[176:15.56]20, I think, is too much.
[176:27.85]I'm thinking 18 will do it.
[176:29.37]18 will do it.
[176:32.13]Yep.
[176:34.49]Keep the combo going.
[176:38.65]I'm back, and I want this cloth robe.
[176:43.39]I'm thinking 1200 will do it.
[176:47.38]Yep.
[176:49.00]More combos.
[176:50.08]I'm doing pretty good.
[176:56.30]Ooh.
[176:57.48]Alright, this is a present.
[176:59.16]3200.
[176:59.20]This girl always... I gotta keep it under like 110.
[177:02.64]I'll say 106.
[177:03.06]Yeah, 106.
[177:04.20]Good.
[177:04.35]What does near pin mean?
[177:12.94]Near pin.
[177:19.18]Near perfect or something?
[177:23.82]So it's near their perfect ideal price.
[177:27.90]I see, okay.
[177:31.04]So let's see, this guy, I'll do 120.
[177:33.13]118.
[177:33.19]1420.
[177:33.21]Nice.
[177:44.92]I already have enough to pay off the debt next week.
[177:58.44]I need to get rid of these rings.
[178:00.50]Let's try to make as much money as I can up front.
[178:08.35]Because something that I have learned since we've started this, these rings never, ever, ever, ever, ever have increased in price.
[178:18.30]They've only decreased in price.
[178:19.78]This is the food corner.
[178:24.95]I'm going to keep the nut mix.
[178:33.54]Uh...
[178:40.39]Cloth robe.
[178:41.99]And let's get the, uh, let's get a chest piece of fruit.
[178:48.23]Tomorrow, I will take Louie into the dungeon.
[178:50.85]Alright, there we go.
[178:53.41]Wooden chest piece.
[178:57.08]We'll do 118.
[178:59.64]Reasonable.
[179:08.79]Wants to sell the candy.
[179:11.29]So the same rules apply then.
[179:13.11]So, I have to buy this to keep the combo going, right?
[179:18.08]So you don't want to haggle with this.
[179:19.80]I need to make sure that I do this.
[179:22.04]Same rule applies.
[179:23.92]I'll do, let's do 50% of base.
[179:26.14]Reasonable.
[179:36.16]I would very much like to place an order for two treasures.
[179:39.81]Yes, I can do that.
[179:40.87]I'll just go buy them.
[179:42.89]Hydrate?
[179:43.31]I'm good.
[179:43.89]I got a Coca-Cola Classic right in front of me.
[179:45.59]And I drank a water downstairs.
[179:49.00]Alright, 110.
[179:53.20]Can't haggle too much, really.
[179:54.26]That'll be fine.
[179:54.90]Ooh, that was near perfect.
[180:03.47]She wants to raid.
[180:03.95]108. 108.
[180:11.84]I feel like she probably wants to buy this for like 90.
[180:13.90]I'll do 105.
[180:34.33]Buy the other rings.
[180:37.33]Yeah, the yam is for sale. 2400.
[180:51.08]Never thought about putting something like this in the store.
[180:53.78]No, never thought about it.
[181:00.29]Never thought about putting an apple in the store.
[181:01.85]You're the first person to think that.
[181:07.21]Can I buy this?
[181:08.01]Alright.
[181:10.13]104.
[181:10.63]That's a near-perfect
[181:16.20]Level 11.
[181:18.60]I think I'm getting the hang of this.
[181:23.98]When's the debt due?
[181:25.24]I got, look at how much time I have for the debt!
[181:27.38]Alright, what, uh, hold on.
[181:39.08]In two days, I need two foodstuffs and two treasures.
[181:41.90]And everything's closed, but...
[181:46.41]Let's get a... Let's try them up there.
[181:53.80]Some chocolate in here.
[181:54.80]Piece of candy.
[181:58.62]Let's do a... Cherry.
[182:02.08]Put a cherry over here.
[182:03.68]And a cherry.
[182:04.44]We'll get the apple over there too.
[182:05.77]Alright, sounds pretty good.
[182:07.07]Let's go.
[182:07.39]Okay.
[182:07.67]Okay.
[182:16.48]114.
[182:16.58]Sounds pretty good.
[182:20.34]At level 12, I can expand the store.
[182:26.06]Oh, shit.
[182:27.04]Are you serious?
[182:28.70]Finally!
[182:29.23]Finally, people are buying these things.
[182:34.07]Took long enough.
[182:34.89]Where'd you guys get the money?
[182:35.85]7,500.
[182:35.87]Okay.
[182:48.76]You want both rings.
[182:52.07]I think I can get away with 110.
[182:56.63]9,000?
[182:56.81]I think I can get away with it.
[183:00.65]Yep.
[183:03.47]Finally cleaning up my ring inventory.
[183:10.96]Now I'm the head of the game.
[183:23.38]May I have a moment?
[183:25.77]Anything new?
[183:26.89]We've already seen this.
[183:30.41]Yeah.
[183:31.85]We've seen it already.
[183:32.51]Alright, what's next?
[183:34.61]Today is... Oh, the guild is closed today, isn't it?
[183:39.89]The guild is closed.
[183:47.95]Oh, is it tomorrow?
[183:49.99]Let's get that out of the way, then.
[183:55.09]I'm cheating.
[183:56.53]Well, wasn't I told that this was, like, a tactical video game strategy?
[184:01.82]No, it's open.
[184:02.80]Alright, let's go get this out of the way.
[184:09.24]Skip this.
[184:10.06]There he is.
[184:12.55]Yep.
[184:14.25]Uh, let's do it.
[184:17.13]Put the steel sword in his inventory so we do this quickly.
[184:26.25]Spoken like a true Redditor.
[184:35.33]Whatever.
[184:35.97]We just need to get to the end.
[184:44.57]I don't need any of this stuff.
[184:45.98]This is all just shit we've already seen.
[184:50.20]Plus, I keep the levels, too.
[184:52.34]So that's a good thing.
[184:52.98]And I keep the moves.
[185:06.38]I've literally rewinded time.
[185:07.83]This wasn't supposed to happen.
[185:11.78]Yeah, but that... you're supposed to try... this is what I... this is... Everybody told me that this is, like, the way you do it.
[185:17.32]So that's the way I did it.
[185:36.43]Alright, here we go.
[185:41.22]The name of the game is literally Resetter.
[185:57.63]Thanks for the card, Louie.
[186:07.07]There's the door.
[186:08.85]Let's go.
[186:18.95]What happens if the chapel... finance company... We already did this.
[186:24.64]We've already seen it all.
[186:31.94]Okay.
[186:39.35]I'm gonna hold on to the weapons.
[186:44.74]I can do one more day here, though.
[186:46.94]Let's put the windbreaker up here.
[186:56.91]Sell an armor piece, too.
[187:07.04]Oh, it's this guy.
[187:07.86]Do I have to go get all that shit again for him?
[187:21.79]dev in the chat.
[187:23.79]I don't believe that to be so.
[187:29.65]Why would a dev be in the chat right now, guys?
[187:38.08]Dev.
[187:38.48]Alright, I got it.
[187:48.60]This game came out like 10 years ago.
[187:52.55]Do you really think the dev is just hanging around Twitch chats now, still?
[187:57.00]You can do 120.
[188:02.76]Nah, 115.
[188:12.65]What the hell is this?
[188:15.19]Golden Pedestal.
[188:23.29]I want it.
[188:31.64]I think 48% is reasonable.
[188:36.08]Or... 50.
[188:45.11]So something I'm realizing, even if I didn't do the Mr. Resetti thing...
[188:50.43]I'm getting more offers to have huge money.
[188:52.93]That thing's like 20 grand.
[188:54.69]It's like day three.
[188:57.21]I'm getting... It would have been essentially the same, wouldn't it have?
[189:04.35]It's the level.
[189:05.17]Okay.
[189:05.75]I see.
[189:06.03]It's based on merchant level.
[189:07.69]I see.
[189:10.25]Alright, let's go.
[189:10.75]How much do you want this for?
[189:12.75]How about 1, 1, 1, 1?
[189:13.65]Thank you very much.
[189:16.17]It's sold.
[189:22.37]Alright, time for bed.
[189:23.69]I lost money today, but it's okay.
[189:32.89]That's why combos are king.
[189:34.11]I'm assuming that there's gonna be a situation, so look, ready?
[189:44.58]200,000 was the wall.
[189:47.12]Then, like, a million is gonna be the wall.
[189:50.38]Does this just keep going to, like, 10 fucking million dollars?
[189:53.64]And I'm gonna have to, like, reset and do, like, kind of prestige again?
[190:05.39]Interesting.
[190:06.55]Whatever that is.
[190:07.29]Alright, so.
[190:07.79]Uh, I have my orders here.
[190:12.05]It's the atmosphere of the store.
[190:13.35]It's alright.
[190:14.05]Merchant level.
[190:15.75]More items!
[190:17.27]At this level, even more items can be found at the guild and in the market.
[190:20.93]And then the store expands, coming up next.
[190:28.72]Alright, so.
[190:30.70]Um, let me go take a look at that.
[190:32.44]Have I even looked?
[190:33.04]I don't think I've even looked in the stores yet.
[190:37.56]What the fuck is this?
[190:38.54]Magnet necklace?
[190:44.66]I mean, yeah, give it to me.
[190:46.26]Old cape.
[190:52.52]Fleece muffler, 80, 400.
[190:54.10]Hard boots.
[190:57.76]Meditation ring, no, no rings.
[190:59.81]Golden scales.
[191:04.53]17,000.
[191:04.77]Wait, when's the day?
[191:09.73]When do I owe the money?
[191:10.95]Soon, right?
[191:18.66]I'm going to make it all back.
[191:19.68]It's going to be huge sales.
[191:21.74]Old vendor.
[191:24.66]An old refurbished vending machine.
[191:26.21]Still usable, although it's a cooling unit.
[191:28.55]21,000 for a vending machine.
[191:32.33]Okay, this is fine.
[191:35.93]It's not today.
[191:37.11]It's not today.
[191:37.91]Give me a break.
[191:39.71]Check this out, though.
[191:40.35]Look at this.
[191:46.21]Where is it?
[191:51.41]I'm going to put it up here.
[191:54.47]Wait, didn't that person want two treasures?
[191:56.61]Who wanted treasures?
[191:57.37]Because I'm going to make like fucking $50,000.
[191:59.03]Somebody wanted two treasures.
[192:02.97]Today.
[192:03.60]Two treasures.
[192:05.22]Oh, you got it.
[192:05.76]I'm going to make a ton of money.
[192:16.60]Watch out.
[192:21.19]Let's get the fleece muffler up there.
[192:24.79]Magnet necklace.
[192:36.37]Don't put them.
[192:36.93]What do you mean?
[192:37.63]I have two of these.
[192:39.53]Don't put them out.
[192:40.55]I have two of those.
[192:46.91]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[192:49.01]Easy!
[192:51.24]Look!

[193:27.10]That's 40... 40... 42,000.
[193:27.52]She's on the cheap side, but I think I can do 43,000.
[193:30.70]Maybe 44,000.
[193:30.86]That's 109,000.
[193:54.34]44,400?
[193:54.36]44,500?

[200:41.32]That's a fair price.

[200:54.11]Although, you know, you've got to spend money to make money.
[201:04.20]What's today?
[201:05.46]I have four days.
[201:06.42]I need to have ten thousand.
[201:12.80]Let's actually... I'm going down.
[201:17.97]I'm going down.

[201:27.65]I gotta start the whole thing over.
[201:29.03]No, I don't.
[201:29.55]Wait, what?
[201:32.29]I have to go unlock Charm.
[201:39.01]Charm unlocks the other one.
[201:44.62]So we have to go to the pub.
[201:46.64]Where did I meet her the first time?
[201:47.82]Yeah, I've already done this.
[201:56.61]Yeah, I have to do the town events.
[202:02.26]Oh, she's, yeah, she's the boss.
[202:04.00]She is the boss.
[202:06.84]Right, so she's down here, 11 to 15.
[202:08.57]And I still have to get the stuff for, uh, well, I guess... Yeah, alright, well, what do I need for, um, let's just go unlock.
[202:26.60]She's the boss of this gym.
[202:31.68]I'm not going to pick it up unless it's worth picking up.
[202:34.52]Or if it's honey.
[202:44.52]He's up to a 20.
[202:45.04]Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
[203:06.11]I need you!
[203:06.79]No.
[203:11.57]He doesn't know.
[203:12.23]He doesn't know about Gachi.
[203:15.87]I don't.
[203:16.17]I don't.
[203:18.01]I know it's an emote.
[203:25.10]These guys have eyes.
[203:36.78]Now.
[203:41.84]Nah.
[203:42.50]Let's just make the event happen.
[203:45.06]I'd like to buy Salmon Max Season 3 for 2,000 picks, please.
[203:52.90]I'm going to have to haggle with you here.
[203:56.30]A little more than that.
[203:57.22]I think it's going to be a little more than that.
[204:08.80]Level 20.
[204:08.98]You know you learn?
[204:12.28]You didn't learn?
[204:13.66]You didn't learn.
[204:15.46]You must learn.
[204:20.03]Everything.
[204:26.51]You know how data and things that are saved forever are interesting, in a way?
[204:33.49]I think I've said that.
[204:35.37]Like...
[204:36.93]It's just something that I say.
[204:38.71]I don't know why.
[204:39.70]Even when the camera is off.
[204:41.54]I say that all the fucking time.
[204:48.15]You know, Kim will be able to tell you a story of how... I think I've already told this story, but... Sometimes I just get on something, I just don't get off.
[204:57.41]After we watched Infinity War, I was just doing Thanos quotes alone.
[205:02.03]I was making like sandwiches and just be, just talk as Thanos and say the same like four lines over and over again.
[205:20.89]I'll just do it.
[205:21.51]I don't know why, because I don't know.
[205:24.71]It's just something that I do sometimes.
[205:27.03]But, the reason why I bring this up is because I've said that on stream so many times.
[205:33.35]You could probably make a four or five minute video compilation of me doing that Game of Thrones guy.
[205:42.70]You probably could.
[205:52.43]I've said it so many times.
[206:04.71]I'm doing it again.
[206:11.09]Talk about the Pizza Hut instructional video instead.
[206:13.88]Why would I do that?
[206:14.76]We just talked about that yesterday.
[206:17.02]What's my favorite show I've ever seen?
[206:19.32]That's tough.
[206:20.42]That's a tough one, dude.
[206:23.35]That's odd.
[206:23.79]I don't know.
[206:25.29]I've seen a lot of good shows.
[206:35.72]What's your favorite ice cream?
[206:37.20]Well!
[206:38.34]Ooh, free iron armor.
[206:42.67]There's this ice cream that's sold.
[206:51.70]I hate the name Sherbert, by the way.
[206:55.24]I'm of the opinion if Sherbert wasn't called Sherbert, most people would think it was good.
[207:10.59]Oh, you guys want something for dessert?
[207:12.81]Yeah, what do you want?
[207:14.03]Ice cream, ice cream.
[207:14.87]Would you want some Sherbert?
[207:17.03]No, shut up, mom.
[207:24.80]I call it sorbet.
[207:25.86]Sherbert is not sorbet.
[207:27.40]They're two different things.
[207:28.76]Let's not have a jelly and jam conversation again.
[207:30.94]Sherbert is not sorbet.
[207:34.98]Are we doing this again?
[207:38.35]They're not the same thing.
[207:39.23]I'm not gonna get into that.
[207:41.25]Sherbert is not sorbet.
[207:43.23]Holy fuck!
[207:44.45]We're not doing it again!
[207:46.19]I'm not doing it again.
[207:50.73]Sherbert is fruit juice and milk.
[207:53.66]Sorbet?
[207:54.20]Okay.
[207:55.54]I almost just fucking ended the fucking stream.
[207:57.46]By... No.
[207:58.60]By exiting this.
[208:05.58]It's too easy.
[208:06.64]What are those, goggles?
[208:11.68]It's too easy.
[208:18.02]End of the stream argument.
[208:22.75]But still though, I like Sherbert, but nobody ever has it.
[208:29.60]Okay, there are almost 4200 people here.
[208:33.76]Does anyone here, and I mean, be honest, does any single person here have Sherbert in their freezer right now?
[208:40.42]I bet you it's zero.
[208:50.93]There's the honey.
[209:00.41]And I like it.
[209:00.89]I love it.
[209:01.73]But why is it, like, less than 0.5% of all people have Sherbert?
[209:11.87]I have Orange Swirl and Sherbert.
[209:13.48]We are the one guy.
[209:18.02]They serve Sherbert in school.
[209:19.76]In plastic cups.
[209:22.78]That's so weird.
[209:31.11]I'm eating it right now.
[209:33.87]I don't believe it, but whatever.
[209:40.43]Come here.
[209:40.82]I love this, I love this, I love this, I love this, I love this, I love this!
[209:50.18]I don't love this.
[209:53.72]Stop!
[209:54.69]Stop it.
[209:55.65]Seriously.
[209:56.09]I haven't had Sherbert since the fifth grade.
[210:04.79]Yes.
[210:06.25]For some reason, the only time people decide to buy Sherbert is to have an option at a birthday party.
[210:13.96]Strange.
[210:22.03]That's also one of the only places that you see Elio's Pizza.
[210:39.44]Is that a birthday party?
[210:40.58]Here we go.
[210:47.44]That stuff is really good, too.
[210:49.08]Elio's pizza is really good.
[210:51.44]Alright, here we go.
[210:51.92]Time for the fight.
[210:53.94]Hey!
[210:54.60]Look at me!
[210:56.70]Come on down.
[210:59.62]The only problem with Elio's pizza is... After you eat Elio's pizza, you do damage to your mouth.
[211:07.31]Real damage.
[211:10.18]every single bite I've ever taken from an elio's pizza did like two to three week long damage to my mouth because it's it's so hot on top and it's like lava in the middle that no matter what you can sit there and let yeah if you don't let it cool for like 20 minutes you you like flakes are coming off of your mouth for like four days alright I'm gonna lose
[211:45.36]It's the only piece of it that's ever tapped into me before.
[211:48.30]Hold on.
[211:49.77]I got a book.
[211:58.53]Remember that joke from yesterday?
[211:59.98]Alright.
[212:06.46]Booze of the world.
[212:09.05]And, ooh, there's that vase.
[212:12.33]Okay.
[212:13.31]I got Charm.
[212:19.25]Very good.
[212:19.87]Let's go to the pub.
[212:23.02]Let's see where she is.
[212:26.02]Skip it.
[212:28.22]Town Square.
[212:29.96]Skip it.
[212:33.44]We've seen it.
[212:36.84]Down.
[212:38.16]Out.
[212:51.48]Ohio.
[212:52.66]Was it Ohio?
[212:53.90]How do you do it?
[212:54.40]Ohio.
[212:56.12]How do you do it?
[213:03.48]Ohio means good morning.
[213:04.42]Ohio.
[213:05.36]Ohio.
[213:06.44]Good morning.
[213:07.68]I like, I'm learning another language.
[213:11.95]Ohio.
[213:12.87]So could I go... Wow.
[213:15.01]This is cool.
[213:16.15]Alright, now, let's go to Fusion.
[213:25.13]Rank 1 staff.
[213:26.47]I need the backscratcher.
[213:32.00]I need... I've already done all this.
[213:34.66]Rank 1 shirt, though.
[213:36.42]Need some furballs.
[213:39.98]Rank 1 helm.
[213:41.52]I need the slime liver.
[213:45.27]But I need to do... First and foremost.
[213:48.95]Let's do this event.
[213:51.03]Skip it, by the way.
[213:51.81]Wait, have I seen this?
[214:00.74]Are we gonna play Doki Doki Literature Club?
[214:02.38]No, I refuse to play that game.
[214:08.21]No, I've seen this, yeah.
[214:18.77]Booze of the World is worth a lot of money.
[214:21.07]Alright, hams.
[214:21.59]Let's get some... Let's get a few ham sandwiches.
[214:27.19]People looking for food.
[214:28.74]Shortcake.
[214:29.26]Let's get, like, a cake.
[214:30.74]Let's get some tuna.
[214:32.14]Alright, stop.
[214:32.88]No, that's enough.
[214:40.95]You got a zero anime game policy.
[214:42.51]You broke it.
[214:44.77]No, listen.
[214:46.15]This is important, because what's going to happen first, I'm going to sneeze in your face.
[214:49.17]Okay.
[214:53.55]Second after I did that.
[214:55.55]I never said that.
[214:58.35]I talked about this yesterday.
[214:59.51]I was so bombarded with the quotation marks, Play Doki Doki Literature Club, end quotation marks, that I had to ban all anime from the stream.
[215:14.59]That was a last resort measure.
[215:26.19]Play Doki... When are you going to do Doki Doki Literature Club?
[215:31.31]And at this point, it's been said so many times, I already know what happens in the game.
[215:35.71]I know it's not like a game that you play and, oh, here it is, here's this regular game.
[215:40.61]I know that, like, fucking, I know, I already know.
[215:44.01]So, my surprise has been ruined.
[215:50.15]No, I didn't get spoiled.
[215:51.47]I just know.
[215:52.49]There's no reason why anyone would ever tell you to do that so many times.
[215:57.43]That's like desperately trying to get me to shake your hand with a hand buzzer in it.
[216:01.29]Hey, dude, uh... You want to shake my hand?
[216:04.93]Why do I want to shake your hand right now?
[216:06.75]I know you, like, hate shaking hands, but, like, shake my hand.
[216:10.48]Um... I've been here for, like, two hours.
[216:13.06]I don't need to shake your hand.
[216:15.52]Just do it, man!
[216:17.12]No.
[216:17.92]I don't want to shake your hand.
[216:19.22]And you call me, like, two days later.
[216:21.72]Hey, dude, I'm not going to come over tonight.
[216:23.60]Can we, like, shake hands when I get there?
[216:26.39]Um...
[216:28.56]Don't I guess maybe I don't know why why do you want to do that so bad?
[216:35.66]Just just because I like I'm like I don't know Scratch that's dog shit Well, look you got like joke gum
[216:52.81]You know the gum that, like, turns your mouth blue and shit?
[216:54.99]It's like a joke, prank gum.
[216:57.75]I'm not, I wasn't gonna let you guys prank gum me.
[216:59.77]I think it's time to put out a, uh, mmm.
[217:11.18]Ooh, the vase, right.
[217:20.92]Booze of the world.
[217:22.00]I think I'm gonna hang on to that.
[217:24.02]Are you excited for your Doki Doki literature cl- No!
[217:30.24]Let's put the ham sandwich.
[217:31.28]That's an important item.
[217:32.28]Let's get the egg toast.
[217:38.82]And let's get the shortcake out there too.
[217:49.05]You.
[217:49.73]There we go.
[217:52.12]Don't, don't, uh, hold on.
[217:53.24]Do I have to do something here?
[217:59.41]And here's the worst part about what I just said, not to keep beating on this, but this is the end point here.
[218:05.63]Eventually, when you tell me to shake your hand so many times, and you call me, and you leave voicemails, and you fucking text me, I'm gonna start to look at your hand, and I see that there's a buzzer there.
[218:18.93]And I just pretend that I don't see the buzzer, because I know you really want to get this, I realize what you're doing.
[218:25.05]And then finally, like a week goes by, and you still have the buzzer in your hand, and I'm just like, hey!
[218:30.33]Let's shake hands, dude.
[218:32.19]And you... What'd you say, dude?
[218:35.13]Hold on.
[218:35.43]What do you want to do?
[218:37.77]I think I want to shake your hand, man.
[218:39.35]It's been a while since we've shaken hands.
[218:42.04]Holy fuck.
[218:42.74]And you're like... Hey, put it there.
[218:47.78]And I go... I did it!
[218:53.04]Eventually, that's kind of how that plays out.
[219:05.29]So I know the outcome there.
[219:19.36]You just promised you're gonna play it.
[219:21.02]Alright, we've already seen this.
[219:28.29]Hey, welcome.
[219:29.37]Hey, I want a weapon.
[219:30.95]I can do that.
[219:32.41]Do you want a cheap weapon?
[219:33.53]Do you want a lance?
[219:36.47]How about a lance?
[219:46.84]Thief's knife?
[219:49.36]Ooh, that's better.
[219:52.54]Yes, it is.
[219:55.30]What do I want for it?
[219:56.18]I'll give it to you for 111.
[219:56.88]3800.
[219:56.92]You don't have 100?
[219:58.60]Really?
[219:58.88]102?
[219:58.90]What?
[219:59.08]Not even 102?
[220:00.78]What, you want me to do it for like 95?
[220:20.31]A durian.
[220:22.03]Uh, I'll take it.
[220:22.65]That sounds pretty cool.
[220:24.15]I'll give it to you for 40%.
[220:27.11]Alright, 50%.
[220:28.15]You got me.
[220:29.75]55%.
[220:29.77]You got me.
[220:39.60]Ham sandwich.
[220:40.30]This'll do.
[220:40.78]117.
[220:43.64]That's a fine price for a ham sandwich.
[220:50.27]Somebody buy the vase.
[220:54.25]Charm.
[220:56.47]One... 107.
[220:59.83]You're perfect.
[221:02.21]Is that sandwich fresh?
[221:04.03]It better be.
[221:04.60]How do I shake my hand?
[221:08.98]A weapon.
[221:09.66]Alright.
[221:14.28]I could sell you a... I don't want to do the expensive ones.
[221:20.10]Here, have a cracker.
[221:26.30]107.
[221:28.70]Perfect.
[221:29.80]Near perfect.
[221:30.52]Remember the car tuna sandwich?
[221:33.24]It wasn't a tuna sandwich.
[221:34.65]It was a turkey sandwich.
[221:36.71]Little lady, I'd like to get two hats.
[221:38.81]If I come pick them up in three days, will you have them for me?
[221:43.01]And by the way, put her there.
[221:47.51]Go home, Grandpa.
[222:00.57]How many times do I have to teach you a lesson, old man?
[222:02.97]What?
[222:06.27]This is how you run a joke into the ground.
[222:10.66]Like asking somebody to play the same thing hundreds and hundreds of fucking times.
[222:18.03]Is that what it's like?
[222:36.26]Tough clothes for the tough crowd that comes in.
[222:55.34]Bright and happy welcome is the key.
[222:57.00]Ah, yeah, we've already seen this.
[223:02.70]There it is.
[223:03.12]I got the card.
[223:04.68]Thank you.
[223:11.89]Tough close.
[223:14.06]Let's do... 103.
[223:15.94]I need to get to level 12.
[223:19.22]This is important.
[223:28.92]You want a weapon.
[223:31.36]How about a... How about a magician's staff?
[223:34.82]You look like you could be a pretty good wizard.
[223:39.64]No, no, no. 108.
[223:52.33]Oh, man.
[223:54.59]Can I get you to buy this from me?
[223:55.73]It's the golden scales.
[223:58.19]Alright.
[223:58.71]Yeah, I'll get it.
[223:59.53]I'll take it off you.
[224:00.09]48%?
[224:04.26]Will you do 48?
[224:06.98]No, I need this part of the combo.
[224:09.10]It's worth buying.
[224:09.70]51%.
[224:09.72]You'll take it.
[224:10.28]Yep.
[224:24.54]Piece of armor.
[224:27.12]Let me deck you out because you're gonna be... Parade armor is not stronger than iron armor, right?
[224:42.61]She needs to use a thief armor.
[224:46.84]Like, robes?
[224:48.80]Breastplate?
[224:50.30]Shell?
[224:50.62]I mean, this is probably going to be pretty good.
[224:59.35]That's really good.
[225:00.07]Alright.
[225:01.09]That's nice.
[225:02.27]Now, I don't want to... I think I'm just going to do it at base.
[225:07.29]I don't have that much money.
[225:08.29]God damn it.
[225:08.93]Really?
[225:10.57]I want you to have this on. 78%.
[225:20.79]I want her to wear it, so.
[225:25.83]Windbreaker, cool.
[225:29.79]108.
[225:31.33]Level 12.
[225:33.15]Level 12?
[225:34.01]Yes!
[225:35.45]We're good.
[225:42.37]Hmm.
[225:43.06]48? 49.
[225:50.71]Good.
[225:52.67]He's addicted to the game.
[225:53.71]I really am.
[225:54.79]It's just, I want to see how it plays out.
[226:12.78]Can I have a few strands of your hair?
[226:17.02]No.
[226:18.24]I don't think that's going to happen.
[226:27.72]Because what are you going to do with that hair?
[226:30.98]I feel like you're going to make a clone or something.
[226:34.35]Nobody asks for a strand of hair unless they're putting it in a tube and shaking it up with hydrochloric acid to make another person.
[226:45.87]What do we got?
[226:47.35]Tomorrow?
[226:54.70]What items do I want to put up here?
[226:57.55]Weirdly enough, there's been no... I'll put the durian up here.
[227:02.05]We're a sandwich and durian store now.
[227:09.56]Hey, let's just... It's drunk again.
[227:24.58]So, found the new dungeon.
[227:25.72]That's all we need to know.
[227:26.52]The new place is now open.
[227:29.24]I would like a treasure.
[227:30.04]Do I have any treasures?
[227:30.82]Oh, yes, I do.
[227:33.98]25,000.
[227:34.00]I'll do 105.
[227:34.37]27,000.
[227:36.81]Should be reasonable.
[227:37.37]Near perfect.
[227:56.16]Yeah, I'll do the expansion tomorrow.
[227:59.74]Alright, if somebody wants the durian.
[228:02.28]112.
[228:02.30]9,000.
[228:02.34]Weapon.
[228:02.70]Let's do longbow.
[228:05.10]Just underneath.
[228:34.10]Ooh, the pole!
[228:37.06]You want... Wait, you have one of these?
[228:39.34]Why are we the only two people in the world that has one?
[228:48.02]Did you look in the window to see if we had one of these and just, what?
[228:51.18]Is this a copy?
[228:52.02]Is this like a fake?
[228:53.06]Thank you very much!
[228:59.18]It's sold!
[229:07.77]Uh, got donated to me by a rich old man.
[229:10.09]He kinda wants it back.
[229:11.03]How much were you taking for it?
[229:14.07]50%.
[229:15.95]That combo meter rollin'.
[229:20.65]Alright.
[229:26.86]Now we're gonna expand the store.
[229:30.14]Does it cost any money?
[229:33.86]If I had a tiny clone of myself, would I torture it?
[229:45.47]That might be... I mean, it's very possible.
[229:49.49]That could be the worst chat message I've read in 2019.
[229:52.35]It's pretty close.
[230:04.00]I don't even know why you even asked that.
[230:08.04]Alright, so, let's expand the store.
[230:13.58]Change flooring, open store, move tables.
[230:16.28]Is there a way to do this?
[230:21.52]At this level, you may expand the store, giving you more room for counters and items.
[230:24.72]So how do I do it?
[230:31.53]No, I would not do that.
[230:38.68]Expansion.
[230:40.66]$10,000 to expand.
[230:42.84]Yeah?
[230:44.72]Alright, cool.
[230:46.26]So what does that do?
[230:52.67]I've seen this already.
[230:53.47]I feel like I should go do an adventure if I'm already out here.
[231:04.59]She has a shitty dagger, but...
[231:11.13]I kinda wanna see what she does.
[231:13.39]Let's do the Amber Garden.
[231:15.57]Floor 6 to 10.
[231:16.13]Let's see if we die.
[231:19.04]Just gotta be careful.
[231:28.72]Well, faster.
[231:29.94]What does her move?
[231:33.79]Clone?
[231:38.96]She can run?
[231:40.72]She can run, can't she?
[231:44.79]Alright.
[231:46.45]Wow, that's worth it.
[231:47.91]That's pretty great, actually.
[231:50.16]Fuck Louie.
[232:06.00]That's pretty cool that I can just, like, hang back and have my clone attack things.
[232:09.79]Ooh.
[232:17.39]Can I put this on right now?
[232:18.31]Although this... I need to level up.
[232:25.13]She's weak as hell right now.
[232:26.35]There we go.
[232:37.38]Pumpkins, new enemy.
[232:39.94]What do they do?
[232:41.84]Are they thwomps?
[232:44.16]Thwomp?
[232:45.58]I knew they were thwomps.
[232:47.58]I just didn't know when.
[232:51.63]Fuck.
[232:52.11]Land on the shadow.
[233:17.20]That's so great.
[233:17.86]I love the run.
[233:22.45]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[233:23.39]Don't die.
[233:23.79]Don't die.
[233:27.13]The 1B, it cannot end this.
[233:29.11]Let me heal.
[233:30.29]I have any heal?
[233:31.13]Uh-oh.
[233:33.00]I don't have any food to eat.
[233:37.82]I gotta be really careful now.
[233:51.88]It's not food.
[234:01.93]It's not food.
[234:02.71]A bee.
[234:05.00]Oh shit.
[234:06.54]Come on, you need to level up.
[234:09.88]It's just a slime, just be careful.
[234:16.05]If I level up, I get everything back.
[234:26.50]What the hell was that?
[234:27.32]Oh.
[234:28.14]What the fuck just happened?
[234:30.60]That just scared the shit- I heard, like, the explosion behind me.
[234:33.28]She's dead.
[234:46.61]We book it back home.
[234:47.65]Normally we would not be able to bring any items with us, loot or otherwise, but thanks to the special little box the guild gave us, we can bring back at least one item.
[234:57.13]She was drunk when we came down here, this is not my fault.
[235:16.47]Victory lap.
[235:20.07]Wasn't there another adventurer over here, right?
[235:29.54]Holy shit, look at this.
[235:34.04]This place is huge.
[235:40.12]Um, alright.
[235:45.05]Good morning.
[235:46.67]You're aware that today is the first day of collections.
[235:48.87]I have it.
[235:51.49]So I can buy more... room, right?
[236:00.65]Actually, no, I have it over here already.
[236:01.89]So there's more over here.
[236:03.33]Do I have any more treasures or anything?
[236:10.71]Charms, helms, necklaces.
[236:13.49]Treasures, yep.
[236:14.31]Let's get these out there.
[236:15.35]I got two poles.
[236:22.20]Keep one of them just in case I need it for something.
[236:25.76]Boots out.
[236:31.22]It was the world, keep it.
[236:34.24]Sand sandwich.
[236:35.80]No, let's put the food items in the middle.
[236:37.42]That makes the most sense.
[236:51.55]Uh, cherry.
[236:53.33]Over here is going to be armor.
[236:54.65]The treasures are in the window.
[237:01.75]Armor and... Armor's gonna be on the left.
[237:05.63]Let's do a Warrior's Helm up here, too.
[237:10.36]Common Shield.
[237:12.78]And Iron... Iron Band.
[237:14.88]Weapons will be on the right.
[237:19.08]I'm thinking... Let's get a Spear out here.
[237:25.66]Counter, counter, counter, counter, counter, counter, counter, counter, counter, counter, counter.
[237:33.36]Wait.
[237:34.62]Vending machine?
[237:35.20]Hold on.
[237:38.62]What's this?
[237:43.57]Vending machine cannot be placed at our level.
[237:49.43]Counter, counter, counter.
[237:50.89]Legendary counter.
[237:51.75]Wait, what do you want me to do with this?
[238:04.18]Move tables?
[238:08.52]Place the- how do I place the counter?
[238:09.76]I don't think there's a way I can place it.
[238:16.77]Unless I can do it with the fairy.
[238:32.16]No, I can't place it.
[238:35.66]Move the table.
[238:47.71]That's fine.
[238:50.39]I'm re-centering it.
[238:51.83]Everyone relax.
[238:56.25]Okay, let's get the couple of... Get a bow out here.
[239:01.46]Staff.
[239:03.86]And a crafter's knife.
[239:06.52]Ready for business.
[239:08.50]Open the store.
[239:09.84]Hydrate?
[239:10.28]Sure.
[239:14.32]Uh, you want a cherry?
[239:15.94]There you go.
[239:19.26]I can change the counter to level 14.
[239:20.26]Oh, okay.
[239:20.50]There we go.
[239:25.88]I want a nice necklace.
[239:31.21]Good deal.
[239:36.92]Do you get more customers?
[239:40.33]Take that home for... I'll give it to you for 110%.
[239:42.33]I want to buy a hat.
[239:53.89]I think I have a couple of those you can take.
[239:57.65]Warm hat.
[239:58.25]I don't know.
[239:59.27]I feel like I'll need that for something eventually.
[240:08.65]If any machine does things, I just can't use it at this level.
[240:13.76]Alright, I think I'm gonna... Let's try that doing that again.
[240:21.36]This time I'm gonna bring a couple of food items.
[240:28.29]I have enough for the dead.
[240:29.97]Let's go.
[240:37.71]I'm going to try this again.
[240:42.09]Rusty dagger.
[240:43.02]We're going to change that.
[240:43.96]I'm going to give you the thief's knife.
[240:48.52]I'm going to bring food this time.
[240:50.34]Let's bring a couple of apples and let's bring candy.
[241:00.63]Bring two candies.
[241:03.69]Here we go.
[241:04.49]Alright.
[241:04.83]I can do this.
[241:05.79]Let's go.
[241:08.82]Armor?
[241:09.28]Doesn't she have new armor?
[241:12.84]Attack power doubled for everyone.
[241:19.50]Didn't she just buy it?
[241:23.94]No, with a better item, you're doing so much better.
[241:33.88]No, I want to explore.
[241:42.86]Oops.
[241:46.03]Ah, I missed.
[241:49.37]I'll take the apple.
[241:54.17]Oh, I just got creamed.
[241:56.73]I got creamed right there.
[241:58.49]That was not fair.
[242:02.83]It's this fucking goddamn ice bullshit, man.
[242:05.45]Like this Mario Maker ice level shit.
[242:10.24]God damn it.
[242:12.72]And I can only take one thing with me.
[242:14.48]I'm so upset right now.
[242:19.86]I got... The rocks came down and hit me.
[242:22.43]I got double hit there.
[242:23.55]Ice level Mario Maker dog shit.
[242:25.97]And I got in debt.
[242:27.97]I can't take her in there.
[242:28.81]I have to go to the other one.
[242:29.75]Okay.
[242:40.95]Yeah, quests, I got quest- yeah, Louie, we don't even care about you anymore.
[242:44.17]Although I should, because you're ten times better.
[242:47.43]I didn't die with Louie one time.
[242:49.75]Even when he was level one.
[242:59.72]Can we see this?
[243:07.72]You want a quest reward?
[243:10.24]I feel like I haven't seen this.
[243:21.95]Louie, you remind me of Papa.
[243:24.65]Louie's not gonna die.
[243:26.01]I will keep Louie alive at all costs.
[243:35.33]First death.
[243:35.93]Alright, I'm ready to go.
[243:47.32]Next is... What is it?
[243:49.85]50?
[243:52.13]I did 3, right?
[243:52.89]Uh-oh.
[243:59.07]Oh, it's her.
[244:02.23]It's oh-ho-ho-ho-ho girl.
[244:05.98]I kind of want to hear it, though.
[244:12.58]Anybody else want to hear it?
[244:31.50]Good.
[244:33.48]Now.
[244:34.20]Next.
[244:34.44]30,000 due.
[244:35.22]Now I'm not going to mess around here.
[244:41.96]I got plenty of money.
[244:42.75]Any more food items?
[244:45.25]I can't believe I lost all that food.
[244:52.99]Toothpicks.
[244:53.49]Cherry.
[245:02.23]Let's go!
[245:08.05]Oh, hello there.
[245:08.77]It's me!
[245:12.97]Eight hours of exposition that we're missing now.
[245:15.80]But it's all good, because we've already seen it.
[245:22.04]Save?
[245:22.44]Yeah, I will.
[245:22.92]Go.
[245:30.68]I'm going for it.
[245:31.20]120, no.
[245:38.27]119.
[245:39.59]I can auto-skip red text.
[245:41.55]Maybe I'll turn that on.
[245:45.31]And sandwich.
[245:45.85]114.
[245:45.89]Hard boots.
[246:01.73]She's rich, right?
[246:02.69]I can do a little bit higher of a margin here.
[246:05.17]126?
[246:06.01]Maybe like 55?
[246:08.75]Or 54?
[246:15.14]I'll keep it under 130.
[246:15.68]Got it.
[246:27.11]Oh, fuck!
[246:28.01]Do I have the hats?
[246:29.03]Yeah, I do.
[246:33.01]I do have the hats that you were looking for.
[246:37.35]I want to keep the warm hat, though.
[246:45.42]118.
[246:48.44]Good.
[246:48.74]Keep the combo going.
[246:53.41]I can go high with Ohoho?
[246:55.49]Yeah.
[246:59.41]Now...
[247:01.84]Uh, I'm gonna do it again.
[247:03.58]Okay?
[247:05.28]I'm not gonna screw this up this time.
[247:20.81]She already has a better chestplate on, doesn't she?
[247:24.45]Iron armband.
[247:29.04]I'm gonna give you a hat.
[247:35.55]Let's take an apple.
[247:38.67]And that's it.
[247:40.21]By the way, we're going to go to floor 1-5.
[247:42.41]I can do this.
[247:58.52]Attack power doubled for everyone.
[248:00.32]Again.
[248:01.82]Alright.
[248:04.88]Now I'm paranoid.
[248:06.40]I'm actually paranoid.
[248:07.40]I'm like freaking out.
[248:11.16]Gunpowder.
[248:18.01]What?
[248:19.23]What just happened?
[248:20.47]Did I just run into the wall?
[248:22.63]What?
[248:24.29]Oh my God!
[248:40.02]Why did I fall down?
[248:42.16]Why did I fall down?
[248:43.86]What made me fall?
[248:53.65]I didn't even fuck it up that time.
[248:55.23]I apparently ran my face into the railing.
[249:01.81]That sucks.
[249:03.65]That's three strikes, man.
[249:04.85]The inning's over.
[249:06.63]That's out number three.
[249:17.39]This is the booze.
[249:18.55]I like booze.
[249:20.13]Alright.
[249:21.65]There's a brand of stuff called ponce, she.
[249:25.57]What happened to not sharing info with us?
[249:27.85]Show folks found out that ponce is right space, she.
[249:32.17]Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
[249:33.51]Hey, that's how charm is, I guess.
[249:40.61]If you dash into walls, she knocks herself down.
[249:43.75]I did not know that.
[249:49.90]All I care about is the money.
[249:52.66]I have plenty of it right now.
[249:54.16]Here we go.
[250:01.88]Candy has increased.
[250:02.88]Who cares?
[250:09.73]Yeah, I saw.
[250:10.33]I know the news.
[250:12.41]Alright.
[250:17.15]This is the last time I'm going to try doing this shit.
[250:49.13]I have to pull her all the way back.
[250:50.73]I can't do the... Okay, there's level 9.
[251:09.01]I'm just gonna kill the rat and then I can take after like level 12 or something Just wanted to test the theory because I didn't believe them for a second I thought it was a glitch
[251:41.13]I don't even want it.
[251:42.35]Okay, so far so good.
[251:44.22]Itchy face, hold on.
[252:10.21]This is awesome sauce.
[252:15.59]Hey, thanks.
[252:17.71]Do people still use that word?
[252:30.84]I want more honey.
[252:31.34]I'm still 10.
[252:32.42]Alright, we're going, we're going, we're going.
[252:39.14]Looking out.
[252:39.58]Things are looking good.
[252:40.30]Come on, Dash.
[252:54.11]Next floor.
[253:01.31]I'm just trying to get EXP, so what's the point of me running by enemies, right?
[253:12.68]What does she say there?
[253:15.44]Ooh, more gold.
[253:19.02]I'm like hoarding these nut mixes for some reason.
[253:22.08]I'm not entirely sure why I'm doing that.
[253:25.63]I wonder if you level up, get something at level 10?
[253:42.05]Maybe something like that?
[253:49.03]Level 10.
[253:49.31]Alright, I got something new.
[253:50.49]What's that?
[253:51.63]Fire?
[253:52.01]Let's see what this does.
[253:56.51]Okay.
[253:59.15]You dash through, people.
[254:01.09]What's that?
[254:01.39]Focus staff?
[254:12.81]It doesn't do that much damage, but I guess you can travel through people really fast.
[254:18.47]It's not bad.
[254:18.95]Another dagger.
[254:21.63]Oops.
[254:22.58]The apple, good.
[254:45.87]Eh, it's alright.
[254:46.93]It's not the greatest, but it's not the worst.
[254:49.87]Nah, fuck this.
[254:52.81]I'm leaving.
[254:55.89]Got it.
[254:56.47]Scrap metal.
[255:20.92]I'm fucking addicted to this game.
[255:22.38]It's clear at this point.
[255:25.04]Do the weapons degrade?
[255:26.72]I don't think they do.
[255:53.75]Like, uh, nope.
[255:57.03]Ow.
[255:58.63]We got raided by John?
[256:01.03]Oh.
[256:02.45]Right, okay.
[256:03.33]So, we got pretend raided.
[256:11.66]I'm looking over like, John!
[256:17.46]Raid!
[256:17.78]John!
[256:18.14]Raid!
[256:18.44]I was like, what?
[256:19.90]I don't know.
[256:20.52]Do I know a John?
[256:27.35]Oh, shit.
[256:27.89]Don't kill me.
[256:34.33]He didn't run with the joke.
[256:35.43]Yeah, I don't know we were doing one.
[256:38.36]I was actually trying to think in my head, who do I know that is John?
[256:41.00]I'm gonna eat something here.
[256:53.78]Almost level 11.
[257:01.88]I don't want to die as a rat, so I gotta actually start to be careful.
[257:07.55]There, level up.
[257:16.51]Oh god.
[257:21.76]I think I can fuse these things now.
[257:23.20]I should have enough, right?
[257:25.76]Or at least close to enough.
[257:31.96]Alright, I got a few levels.
[257:33.14]I might as well check.
[257:37.30]Ow.
[257:38.28]That's pretty useful.
[258:04.61]Oh, I can eat this bread.
[258:06.53]Oh, shit.
[258:08.27]Have I picked up that many things?
[258:14.85]I have picked up a lot of stuff, huh?
[258:16.37]Damn.
[258:16.95]Alright, what am I going to throw away?
[258:18.01]Just eat the apple?
[258:20.95]Or throw away the... The staff sucks.
[258:25.38]This room sucks.
[258:28.88]I'm just going to eat this right now.
[258:39.56]We'll close.
[258:43.08]How am I?
[258:46.98]Half way to 12?
[258:47.34]No, I don't want that thing.
[258:49.77]Timing was off, but it's alright.
[258:57.53]Alright, let's go.
[259:02.78]I didn't know you were here.
[259:17.32]Aren't you worried about not collecting $200,000?
[259:19.22]Well, not yet.
[259:21.79]I got like a month to figure that out.
[259:25.67]Don't eat that one.
[259:26.51]I thought it was dead!
[259:46.82]There we go.
[259:47.28]Eat.
[259:48.54]Consume.
[259:49.22]Eat.
[259:51.34]Eat.
[259:51.60]Eat.
[259:51.80]Eat.
[259:51.96]Eat my child.
[260:27.12]Get it.
[260:27.94]Alright, backscratcher, please.
[260:29.44]So I can get the item.
[260:33.40]I'll take that, though.
[260:34.10]That's good.
[260:40.32]Throw away some piece of shit.
[260:42.90]I'm gonna throw away... I can't throw away your stuff, can I?
[260:45.04]No.
[260:46.26]This thing sucks.
[260:46.82]Get rid of it.
[260:49.68]Charred lizard.
[260:52.14]And... That's it.
[261:08.02]Into her cups again.
[261:08.94]We've seen this already.
[261:14.88]We've seen this already, I believe, as well.
[261:19.15]Did the boss rush for the items?
[261:21.13]Let me take inventory first.
[261:27.23]Let's go see.
[261:27.77]What do I got?
[261:30.12]I have plenty of good stuff here.
[261:31.16]I just want to get rid of this thing.
[261:40.05]It's worthless.
[261:42.41]Last little shop before we go to bed.
[261:46.95]Welcome.
[261:48.87]Candy apple!
[262:00.97]I need two foodstuffs and I'm gonna need them in two days.
[262:04.57]I accept your challenge.
[262:05.89]Did I just buy that?
[262:12.46]Fuck me.
[262:17.32]I can afford that.
[262:24.99]I saw the heart, that was good.
[262:35.30]One thousand.
[262:41.48]Yeah, I haven't saved in a long time.
[262:42.74]That's a good call.
[262:45.32]Oh dear, we need a ring at home, you see.
[262:49.15]The one time that I don't have rings, really.
[262:52.83]You want rings now?
[262:55.63]Where were you when I had eight of them?
[263:00.92]There's nothing to be done.
[263:01.80]Well, goodbye.
[263:06.18]Get with the vending machine.
[263:10.36]Something warm.
[263:11.32]Ah.
[263:15.70]A thick robe?
[263:23.25]Raincoat?
[263:27.17]I would say a thick robe.
[263:32.15]The warm hat.
[263:36.89]Nice.
[263:47.37]Time for bed.
[263:51.75]So I got, as long as I keep myself, here's the plan.
[263:55.75]I have to stay 100% over the debt.
[264:00.57]So if the debt is 30, I need to always be at $60,000.
[264:06.03]Get the daggers off the menu.
[264:14.66]Just get rid of the staff, I don't want it.
[264:18.47]What food do I have?
[264:25.35]Put the candy out.
[264:30.21]Candy apple, candy apple.
[264:31.43]Let's go.
[264:41.75]Oh, yeah.
[264:43.73]Two foodstuffs.
[264:44.89]I need a lot of food.
[264:47.35]I gotta check those orders, because I need... Alright, longsword.
[264:52.21]I think that's actually worse than the thing you have right now.
[265:03.18]Give him two-day-old cheeseburgers.
[265:14.86]As long as I get over the 200,000 debt tonight, I'll be happy.
[265:17.82]Ooh.
[265:18.08]115.
[265:18.10]69.
[265:21.72]No, 7,000.
[265:28.57]Reasonable enough.
[265:29.37]Why am I selling so low?
[265:32.96]Because I want to try to string together perfect combos.
[265:37.28]Because that's how you get levels.
[265:41.56]I need a treasure I got.
[265:43.24]Can I just get one?
[265:46.66]Right here.
[265:48.22]21, 4,000.
[265:53.94]I could probably do 25 on this.
[266:01.83]24 24 000 do it yes how's my alignment doing we're down in dark and plain but I got like the cute thing down there
[266:30.10]What's next?
[266:30.60]Door expansion.
[266:31.26]Fusion Rank 2 is coming up after this.
[266:36.42]It's the wallpaper.
[266:37.78]Yeah, that's alright though.
[266:43.18]I feel like I want at least one of these because it's probably used for a recipe.
[266:49.12]Speaking of recipes.
[266:52.17]Where's my orders?
[266:53.01]Get over here.
[267:00.39]We got... Tomorrow is two foodstuffs.
[267:03.96]I have the charred lizard.
[267:04.80]I have the bat wings.
[267:05.44]I need the slime liver.
[267:07.18]Let's go get that.
[267:09.24]Let's go boss rush.
[267:11.40]It's closed.
[267:12.06]Never mind.
[267:25.47]There's nothing I can... Ugh.
[267:27.90]Anything I can do here?
[267:29.55]Oh, you too.
[267:29.87]Your timing is great.
[267:31.89]I have a little problem that I need your help with.
[267:34.23]Uh, is this the fusion thing?
[267:37.01]Package that needs to be delivered to the orphanage.
[267:38.59]Yeah, I'm remembering this.
[267:40.09]Yeah, let's go.
[267:43.99]And then there's that guy.
[267:45.57]Yeah, alright.
[267:46.19]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[267:47.07]This is how we unlock the third guy.
[267:54.49]This is Elan, right.
[267:55.91]Okay.
[267:56.53]Elan.
[267:57.59]There he is.
[267:58.01]There he is.
[267:59.95]Alright.
[268:01.25]He's now available for us to talk to.
[268:02.65]Let's open the store again.
[268:17.02]No, I don't want to get rid of this stuff.
[268:21.08]There we go.
[268:22.50]Open it up.
[268:26.54]Slime liver?
[268:28.00]Yeah, save, save, save.
[268:28.74]You're right.
[268:31.33]Ten and a half hours.
[268:32.19]It's been a while since I put ten plus hours into a game.
[268:37.03]That was the same game.
[268:39.05]Buy a new floor.
[268:40.05]I will after this.
[268:45.29]There it is.
[268:45.69]Windbreaker.
[268:46.17]That's probably going to be perfect.
[268:49.76]Yep.
[268:52.74]So every time I do a near perfect, I gain reputation with that person.
[268:59.40]Am I going to be finishing the game today?
[269:00.88]Yeah.
[269:15.94]Maybe.
[269:17.20]It depends.
[269:19.72]This game has 30 more hours in it.
[269:24.62]I want this watermelon.
[269:25.66]40... 50... 50%.
[269:33.16]We'll see.
[269:33.74]After I get over 200,000, let's see what it says.
[269:35.42]Everybody wants food.
[269:46.19]I need more food.
[269:46.89]Alright, there's the candy apple.
[269:51.89]No, 112.
[269:52.46]Everyone's hungry for some reason.
[269:57.58]I don't know why.
[270:07.68]Almost level 13.
[270:10.56]Fusion level 2 will get us some ridiculous expensive items.
[270:14.79]Ooh, here we go.
[270:16.27]I'm gonna be normal, though.
[270:17.05]Let's do 175%.
[270:17.27]525%.
[270:17.31]Yeah.
[270:17.41]Let's be reasonable. 13%.
[270:39.77]120.
[270:39.79]He'll do it.
[270:45.85]Mother-in-law?
[270:51.50]Selling an apple.
[270:54.74]Always do 50% with food.
[270:57.50]That really does work.
[271:05.14]Have I started haggling in real life?
[271:07.72]This game's getting to me.
[271:08.74]I'm like trying to... I was at the drive-thru last night.
[271:14.21]Telling the guy to put like three extra fries in the bag.
[271:25.67]Hey, I'm gonna buy a 10-piece nugget, but you're gonna put 15 in.
[271:30.56]What?
[271:32.52]Oh, just kidding.
[271:35.75]And he puts in eight.
[271:36.61]Okay, what do I need?
[271:43.93]New floor.
[271:44.39]Everyone was like, new floor.
[271:45.33]This floor sucks, right?
[271:46.17]So, okay, I'll get a new floor.
[271:49.43]I need more food.
[271:50.23]What do I have for food right now?
[271:56.43]Apple, watermelon, honey.
[271:58.99]I gotta buy some more food.
[272:01.55]So I'm gonna do this tomorrow morning.
[272:03.96]Market's closed right now.
[272:07.70]So I'm gonna... We'll just do one... Let's just open the store, just get rid of the inventory.
[272:16.06]It's the... Good day, right?
[272:18.02]You haven't completed my order.
[272:18.94]I will, I will, I will.
[272:19.94]I'm gonna get the slime liver.
[272:21.54]That's all I need.
[272:28.77]Ooh.
[272:31.29]He wants the statue.
[272:33.53]I'll try to get money out of this one.
[272:34.97]Let's go with 126.
[272:40.46]I'm so good at pricing stuff.
[272:44.24]I'm so good at it.
[272:53.33]Over 100,000.
[272:53.51]Ooh.
[272:53.73]The peach tin.
[273:02.73]I have to get more food, otherwise there's six orders I need.
[273:06.31]One... We'll do 113.
[273:13.16]What is it like to work with Jerma?
[273:15.16]What's it like to work with me?
[273:16.12]Um... I don't know.
[273:20.16]Probably pretty good.
[273:30.15]Work for me or work with me?
[273:32.77]Long swords, guys.
[273:33.61]This is, uh... This is what we... This is why we were keeping all these.
[273:43.56]It's longsword day!
[273:59.25]I'm gonna keep the steel sword because I want Louie to have it.
[274:03.08]And it's foodstuff day too.
[274:04.32]Alright, let's go buy some food.
[274:07.44]Some good food.
[274:12.15]I could do ham sandwiches.
[274:14.07]How much is a ham sandwich?
[274:16.32]23.
[274:16.34]What's more expensive than that?
[274:17.62]24.
[274:17.68]Shortcake.
[274:18.12]Just buy like six shortcakes.
[274:27.10]Check this.
[274:27.50]This is a little girl.
[274:33.64]You fix the stuff.
[274:36.08]Doll.
[274:36.44]You fix the doll.
[274:39.66]Here we go.
[274:42.27]Now, let's get some stuff out here.
[274:45.45]I wish I could put this out.
[274:47.65]I wish I could do anything with this right now, but I can't.
[274:51.71]Get the watermelon out here.
[274:53.65]It's a sword day, so I don't want to put that much more stuff out.
[274:55.76]Let's go.
[274:57.54]There we go.
[275:03.30]First longsword.
[275:04.12]We're going to do... Maybe, should I do just 2,000 for all of them?
[275:14.84]Either 2000 or... I don't know if I want to do 200.
[275:20.48]175% I think is fine.
[275:24.16]Yeah, she's cheap.
[275:26.48]She's cheap.
[275:34.25]I'll also take one of those long swords.
[275:37.53]Now you, on the other hand, I know you're good for it. 2400.
[275:50.27]I do have the things you asked for.
[275:51.94]I have two cakes for you.
[275:55.68]3,500.
[275:55.70]3,500.
[275:55.72]Oh, yeah.
[275:56.34]7 grand base.
[275:56.82]I could probably do 8,000, though.
[276:14.28]Yep.
[276:14.80]Sword.
[276:23.62]Cherries?
[276:25.99]No, I don't wanna... Whatever, I gotta keep it going.
[276:38.93]Yam.
[276:40.33]Ah, you wanna sell a yam.
[276:42.99]I'll take it.
[276:49.42]Dark plain is the best atmosphere you can get to get old men to come in the store.
[276:54.28]Really?
[276:58.56]Why?
[277:09.17]Any chance I could turn this into some money?
[277:12.98]I'll take it for 50%.
[277:24.73]Thankfully, the swords are doing well.
[277:33.90]Level 40?
[277:34.32]What do I do at 14?
[277:35.30]I got something else, right?
[277:39.66]Come here.
[277:44.28]14 is change counters, finally!
[277:46.66]And I can do the vending machine next.
[277:50.28]Fusion rank 2.
[277:51.22]Ugh, okay, hold on.
[277:53.79]I can do counters.
[277:59.49]Change tables.
[278:01.73]Legendary counters.
[278:04.99]Legendary super counter.
[278:06.13]Line up items, use it as a desk.
[278:10.14]These just look like cardboard.
[278:11.26]This looks like shit.
[278:17.33]These look way, way worse.
[278:18.77]I need a new floor, too.
[278:26.42]Yeah, let's go get a new floor.
[278:35.57]Flooring.
[278:36.11]Brick floor, ruins floor, bamboo mat, red floor, leaf floor, earthen floor.
[278:46.26]Quality plank floor.
[278:49.81]Arranged in pleasing patterns.
[278:50.83]Hard to clean, though.
[278:53.03]$46,000.
[278:57.03]That's so much money.
[278:57.89]I'm gonna go with leaf.
[279:07.34]Counters.
[279:11.92]Barrel counter.
[279:13.66]Draped counter.
[279:14.34]The legendary counter looks stupid.
[279:16.50]Draped counter.
[279:21.44]The walls.
[279:23.20]I don't like the heretic walls.
[279:26.20]How about like stone?
[279:34.11]Just like a nice stone.
[279:40.17]Fake stone versus stone.
[279:41.43]Why would fake stone be more expensive than real stone?
[279:47.48]I'll leave it as is.
[279:48.28]Let's just go back.
[279:56.88]Uh-huh.
[279:58.94]Yep, we saw this already.
[280:01.90]Let's make our home look nice.
[280:06.29]So let's change the floor.
[280:11.91]This is ugly.
[280:12.53]This is really ugly.
[280:18.33]I like these.
[280:24.91]The resort walls are so much nicer looking than the... I need a different carpet though.
[280:36.70]This is, yeah, it's horrible.
[280:49.03]It's dark and gaudy.
[281:00.57]It's a goth store.
[281:02.79]Well, not quite.
[281:03.51]Alright, let's do... Oh, I want to see the fusion stuff.
[281:09.64]There's a new rank 2 fusion.
[281:16.26]Power Glove.
[281:18.74]Rank 1.
[281:20.24]Rank 2.
[281:21.45]I don't even know what the hell this stuff is.
[281:23.13]I need to find it first.
[281:24.09]20 apples!
[281:26.99]Oh, jeez.
[281:27.53]This is... Oh, jeez, Rick!
[281:31.27]Did I really just do, oh, jeez?
[281:33.70]Oh, jeez.
[281:42.06]I can't believe I just did that.
[281:44.67]I did an, oh, jeez.
[281:49.44]Nah, I can't do any of these.
[281:53.79]You know what the funniest thing in the world is?
[281:57.01]If you... If you just say the word... Rick and Morty... Somebody tries to... Eat your fucking... Eyes with a knife.
[282:12.34]All you have to say the... You just have to say the word... Like Morty.
[282:17.53]And it's just... It's game over.
[282:19.59]Ooh, I can do this.
[282:30.36]No, I gotta unlock the... Sam's hat.
[282:32.30]Oh, I remember this one.
[282:39.15]Why is that just like a horrible thing to hear?
[282:44.79]Otsukaresamadeshita.
[283:26.87]Men of character are currently seeking out rusty daggers.
[283:32.17]Price of candy is normalized, finally.
[283:33.89]Took like three weeks.
[283:44.96]Men of character.
[283:48.98]Alright, where... We got two days.
[283:51.24]I got plenty of money.
[283:55.30]I need to go deeper into the dungeon.
[284:00.56]Put it to get a new floor.
[284:01.46]I like this floor.
[284:03.99]It's not that bad.
[284:05.05]You'll get used to it.
[284:05.67]You'll like it.
[284:10.87]Right, okay.
[284:11.35]Dungeon.
[284:11.99]Let's go to the dungeon.
[284:14.71]Adventurer's Guild...
[284:18.36]Bring a thieves knife with you.
[284:20.16]I'm going to bring some food too.
[284:23.66]Do I have any food?
[284:24.88]Yes, I do have apples.
[284:26.90]Apple, cherry.
[284:29.37]Okay.
[284:31.01]I'm going to do this this time.
[284:32.69]I'm going to do it.
[284:34.29]I'm ready.
[284:39.25]Amber garden, floor six to ten.
[284:52.19]It's equipped, right?
[284:52.99]Let me make sure it is.
[284:55.01]It is.
[284:58.45]Alright.
[284:59.77]Let's go.
[285:00.27]I ain't gonna blow it this time.
[285:10.23]I'll probably get to level 12 before I go down a floor.
[285:12.47]And then we're looking for cool items.
[285:15.23]Unidentified stuff we haven't seen before.
[285:20.22]That's just a hat.
[285:20.98]I don't want that.
[285:26.16]These guys are the worst.
[285:29.62]Because I gotta get close.
[285:33.33]Motherfucker.
[285:35.81]Why?
[285:40.41]Doing better than last time.
[285:41.71]Pumpkins?
[285:51.41]Really?
[285:55.17]Woo!
[285:56.73]Gaseous grass.
[286:03.73]That's new.
[286:04.89]Alright, drop some frames.
[286:10.73]Eh, it's alright.
[286:13.14]It's alright.
[286:17.20]Slime liver or slime fluid?
[286:18.90]Eh.
[286:20.44]Oops.
[286:23.81]I don't know what happened there, but apparently I... Critical strikes?
[286:27.53]Counter-attacked?
[286:29.73]Oh, it's over.
[286:32.05]I can't do it.
[286:33.93]I can't do it like this.
[286:34.74]I can't do it like this!
[286:42.16]Get me to the exit, quick.
[286:44.22]Before this gets any worse.
[286:45.14]Watch out for that fish that's just chasing me.
[286:47.16]Fuck, it's gonna hit me.
[286:53.89]Alright, get me to the next floor.
[286:56.95]There's probably going to be a boss, too.
[286:58.83]I'm going to get destroyed.
[286:59.87]Nice batwing.
[287:06.35]Use the D-pad for the parry.
[287:35.71]These pumpkins suck.
[287:38.13]Something just dropped, though.
[287:38.85]What is that?
[287:39.87]Herb seed?
[287:48.70]Drop on the shadow.
[287:51.54]I'm getting new items, though.
[287:57.34]That's good.
[288:00.41]Oh, fuck.
[288:01.01]I have to eat something.
[288:02.51]Don't... Just don't blow it.
[288:03.37]Just eat.
[288:03.91]I have... That's why I brought them.
[288:05.09]That's why I brought the apples.
[288:07.05]Alright, I'm fine.
[288:11.97]A whole lot of bullshit.
[288:31.16]Orange?
[288:32.38]Nice.
[288:32.74]Okay.
[288:33.16]Almost level 13.
[288:38.07]And then I get full health and full mana.
[288:43.77]Easy.
[288:44.53]Easy, easy, easy.
[288:51.76]Kill this idiot.
[288:53.12]Kill this guy, and then I level up.
[288:54.36]We're good.
[288:55.68]We're good.
[288:56.20]We're good.
[288:56.68]Everything's fine.
[289:01.06]It's wooden.
[289:01.54]I don't really want it.
[289:02.34]I got a lot of stuff to throw away and a lot of junk.
[289:05.98]A lot of stuff is junk.
[289:09.14]You serious?
[289:23.76]Don't run into the wall.
[289:24.80]Don't run into this guy either.
[289:28.64]I had to dodge this thing.
[289:37.11]Alright, almost done, right?
[289:38.43]Floor 7?
[289:39.01]Not quite.
[289:45.46]Take it so I can eat it.
[289:49.16]The pumpkins have a shitload of experience.
[289:57.53]I still need the slime liver.
[290:02.65]I gotta go back and do it again.
[290:05.80]There's too much... There's so much to do.
[290:11.16]It's a little time in the day.
[290:12.40]Attack power doubled for everybody.
[290:22.79]That's bad.
[290:23.33]That means if I get hit like twice, I die.
[290:26.51]I can't... I don't...
[290:36.45]That was off-screen.
[290:39.19]That's some off-screen bullshit.
[290:41.73]Alright, this same shit happened to me last time.
[290:43.92]I'm not gonna let that happen again.
[290:58.22]He's losing it.
[290:58.76]He's losing it.
[290:59.26]He's losing it.
[290:59.78]No, I'm good.
[291:09.60]get to 14. what level is um level louie's like 18 or 19 right something like that 20 20 right right right by the way if I get hit by that it would kill me instantly so good thing I didn't get hit by it just eat the bread
[291:44.61]70 damage, that's pretty good.
[291:49.99]I think I can get to 14.
[291:53.21]On the same floor.
[291:54.16]14, almost.
[292:02.48]Probably get in here.
[292:12.95]Thanks for the free EXP!
[292:14.53]Got it.
[292:16.67]Alright, let's go.
[292:27.48]Just go.
[292:35.89]News!
[292:36.37]Defense power doubled for everyone.
[292:43.31]Alright, so I got one more floor and then we're probably going to see a boss.
[292:47.14]Do I just go down?
[292:48.84]I wonder if I should just try to fight the boss with the items that I have.
[292:51.26]Yeah, this is going to be hell.
[292:55.09]What's this?
[292:55.39]A cube?
[292:56.51]Eternal Ice.
[292:57.43]I don't want to lose that.
[293:00.59]That seems like a really good item.
[293:10.84]I just got, like, the Tesseract.
[293:12.96]I don't think I want to lose it.
[293:28.51]Although I probably might be able to get to 15.
[293:31.93]It's very... I don't know.
[293:33.50]It might not be worth the risk.
[293:35.80]I'll try.
[293:40.97]Everything takes forever to kill now, though.
[293:43.75]I don't think that means more experience.
[293:47.10]That just means harder to kill.
[293:52.04]Okay, whatever the... Nice.
[293:54.96]Ooh, alright.
[293:55.42]Not bad.
[294:24.23]I think I'm just gonna go.
[294:27.83]I think that's what's gonna happen.
[294:29.13]I got pretty much full health on everything.
[294:30.73]Full... I won't have to deal with the defense shit anymore.
[294:33.09]After these guys, I'm just gonna go through.
[294:38.32]Let's see what it is.
[294:41.24]Uhhh... No.
[294:41.98]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[294:43.42]Get the... That's what I'm here for.
[294:44.72]I'm here to level her up.
[294:53.12]I'd be breaking the rule.
[294:55.10]That's what I'm doing here.
[294:55.88]Seven.
[294:56.84]Seven.
[294:57.61]Ten.
[294:57.77]Ten.
[294:58.05]Slime fluid.
[294:59.09]I want to throw that away.
[295:00.49]Stupid red coat.
[295:01.45]Fall.
[295:24.18]Fall!
[295:27.08]Fall, please.
[295:30.08]Okay.
[295:30.81]Of course you wait that long.
[295:32.85]Thanks.
[295:33.57]Appreciate it.
[295:34.91]That was great.
[296:06.18]15 before I do the boss, please.
[296:08.16]I can do it.
[296:08.56]There's like enough spawned enemies.
[296:10.12]Alright, don't be stupid here.
[296:15.20]Alright, that's the best thing I've found so far.
[296:18.22]And with this deep down... Let's get the respawn.
[296:28.42]This should level me up, although it might not.
[296:30.62]It is pumpkin, so it'll work a lot.
[296:37.24]Is it all pumpkins?
[296:38.10]No.
[296:38.34]Don't even pick it up.
[296:46.23]Not even worth it.
[296:56.13]I'm gonna get hit every single time by these dumb things.
[297:08.47]So close.
[297:11.67]Get rid of this shitty slime fluid.
[297:15.85]Gaseous grass again.
[297:17.05]Alright, let's get back.
[297:17.97]15.
[297:20.95]There it is.
[297:25.07]No time like the present.
[297:28.43]The Insect King!
[297:31.38]Probably gonna hit it right in the eye.
[297:35.98]Oh no.
[297:36.82]Okay, hold on.
[297:50.03]Yeah, I could use the d-pad for this shit
[298:19.16]Fuck.
[298:21.66]Oh my god, I'm getting stuck!
[298:54.55]Greedy.
[298:55.29]Got it.
[299:12.31]He dropped something, what is this?
[299:13.21]It's like a note?
[299:15.05]Tough shell.
[299:18.71]Ooh, I'm probably gonna need that for something.
[299:25.61]Yeah, that's enough.
[299:26.65]It's time to get up.
[299:33.78]Keep going on no balls.
[299:36.54]I'm not going to keep going down there.
[299:37.77]What are you, crazy?
[299:40.23]Where is it?
[299:43.55]Tough shell.
[299:44.15]Alright.
[299:54.42]Let me... Let me see here.
[299:56.71]Fusion.
[299:58.65]Rank 1 Bow.
[300:02.81]I wonder if this is worth doing.
[300:04.25]I wonder what Rank 2 Bow is.
[300:09.78]I could do a Maiden's Bracelet, but no.
[300:12.36]Rank 1 Helm?
[300:13.14]I can do this.
[300:14.02]Not quite.
[300:18.79]Rank 1 Muffler.
[300:22.19]Rank 2 bow is... No.
[300:25.51]I'll do the rank 1 bow.
[300:28.51]Weapons are always worth more.
[300:30.61]Longbow and urgency.
[300:34.99]Meh.
[300:35.37]6500.
[300:35.41]Not bad.
[300:38.23]Not very good either, though.
[300:48.21]I'm also going to go back to here.
[300:54.19]Longsword's still expensive?
[300:55.31]Yes, they are.
[300:55.95]Alright.
[300:57.95]I'm gonna put the longswords in the window.
[300:59.19]I'll fix it in a minute, don't worry.
[301:04.42]Alright, that's fine.
[301:17.32]I'm going to put the steel sword up here.
[301:19.64]Might as well just do it.
[301:24.65]Somebody eventually is going to want to use this, right?
[301:31.71]Let's get some cakes over here.
[301:42.48]Yam.
[301:43.16]Candy apple.
[301:46.51]Your store is disgusting.
[301:47.77]My store is just fine.
[301:49.95]Wait, no, no, no, no, no.
[301:50.67]Get these.
[301:51.09]I, I, I, um, take these off.
[301:53.35]I have these cakes for a very specific reason.
[301:54.83]They have to go in the food bucket thing.
[302:03.63]Um... Let's just put chocolate up.
[302:09.55]Hold the books.
[302:12.81]Hold this, hold that.
[302:15.09]Put some charms up, maybe.
[302:16.37]Alright, whatever, let's go.
[302:24.34]I do have the food.
[302:28.86]That's why I took these off, because look at that.
[302:32.10]Expensive shit.
[302:37.04]I'll do it at 8100.
[302:44.34]I didn't know the Jerma was a genius like me!
[302:48.80]There we go, a steel sword.
[302:55.03]Let's do 2... 2... 10.
[302:55.51]Haha!
[303:09.78]A ring!
[303:10.35]I still don't have any rings.
[303:11.83]I should just go buy one.
[303:13.73]She's going to come back and want one, right?
[303:15.19]There goes the combo.
[303:25.78]Uh, she's cheap, so I'm going to do 175.
[303:28.00]Okay.
[303:38.23]Ooh.
[303:39.39]Sell this.
[303:39.83]I'll take it.
[303:40.25]Let's see if I can get it for 46%.
[303:47.37]Oh.
[303:49.22]Kid's a genius.
[303:56.04]Same thing.
[303:56.54]Let's give you these.
[304:00.21]I made out really well with these.
[304:06.56]82, I mean, that's, I did really well there.
[304:11.48]Already on the way to the 80,000.
[304:18.90]First person to come for the watermelon, you usually, you don't, it's hard to sell.
[304:21.79]I don't think, I think I'm going to stay around 2,500.
[304:23.61]What is pi to 300 digits if you're such a genius?
[304:33.81]3.146412243461188227724499944433267434210 What increased?
[304:34.60]Weapons.
[304:34.96]What weapons increased?
[305:02.32]All weapons have increased.
[305:03.38]This is what we waited for.
[305:04.40]Here we go, guys.
[305:06.48]Check it.
[305:07.36]Watch this.
[305:12.61]We are now a weapons-only store.
[305:15.63]And I'm talking expensive weapons.
[305:23.08]What's the most expensive shit I got?
[305:24.60]Pretty wand.
[305:27.70]This rosebud bow.
[305:31.04]Practice lance.
[305:32.52]I could do the thief's knife.
[305:36.07]Sturdy glove?
[305:36.75]No, no, no, no, no.
[305:42.73]Thief's knife.
[305:43.65]No.
[305:46.49]This magician's staff.
[305:51.48]I want her to buy this thief's knife.
[305:54.68]So I'm gonna get out of the window.
[305:58.92]Alright, we're gonna have some food over here too.
[306:07.42]I'm alright with the food being there.
[306:09.03]Let's go.
[306:11.75]Jerma's Weapon Buyback Emporium.
[306:19.21]I'll take that at value, 103.
[306:26.96]I got the heart.
[306:27.84]I got a perfect sale, too.
[306:31.49]This is what happens when you offer food.
[306:35.47]Two foodstuffs.
[306:36.75]Again, I'm just going to go buy the cakes.
[306:39.15]Just buy the cakes and sell them at times two.
[306:42.54]Easy.
[306:44.28]That's it?
[306:48.56]What?
[306:54.11]Oh, it's this guy again.
[306:59.90]I need two foodstuffs.
[307:01.22]If I return in three... No, everyone just... Should I just... I'm just gonna go buy like 30 cakes.
[307:06.34]Nobody wants weapons.
[307:10.88]There it is.
[307:11.24]I have to do this at like 160, 170% though.
[307:18.32]She won't buy it if it's over like 180.
[307:19.24]I'll try 180.
[307:19.54]I mean, that's 12,000.
[307:19.98]She won't do it.
[307:29.49]I'll do 12-5, but she's not gonna do it.
[307:35.13]Holy fuck, she actually did.
[307:38.80]Alright, that's not a bad sale.
[307:43.34]I need a new piece of armor.
[307:48.34]I could do gloves.
[307:53.22]Or I could do iron armor.
[307:54.86]But honestly, you can't wear that, right?
[307:57.39]I'm just gonna sell her the gloves.
[308:00.64]I mean, times two.
[308:05.75]Wait, what's wrong?
[308:08.25]Gloves are armor.
[308:12.97]I thought it has to be a breastplate.
[308:17.78]Gloves are a weapon.
[308:18.68]Are you really asking me if I have a weapon?
[308:25.68]That's all that's in here.
[308:26.50]Alright, what's the most expensive thing I have?
[308:29.18]Bow.
[308:30.16]Practice Lance is probably the most expensive thing.
[308:33.29]Perfect.
[308:33.65]How much?
[308:34.19]That'll be... Nine... Ninety... Ninety-two hundred?
[308:50.32]Pretty good day so far.
[308:57.86]I'm going to get ballsy here.
[308:59.36]225.
[309:06.67]That's a much better day.
[309:07.75]A much better hour.
[309:14.93]Get this off.
[309:17.62]Any more expensive stuff?
[309:22.56]Put the parade armor up there.
[309:24.42]Someone will buy it.
[309:27.52]Although I've been holding onto these because at some point they'll be worth more.
[309:30.96]Nah, I'll take that off.
[309:33.32]Not worth it.
[309:33.72]Put iron armor up there.
[309:38.75]Sturdy glove.
[309:41.41]Eh.
[309:44.11]Closet bow, that looks good too.
[309:52.60]Come on in.
[309:58.53]Hey miss, I need two foodstuffs.
[309:59.69]If I return in three days... I'm going to have a lot of food orders here.
[310:09.30]Oh, look at that.
[310:11.81]Crafter's knife.
[310:13.45]Don't have to keep bringing it with me.
[310:18.29]I want you to have this though, so I'm going to do 185.
[310:20.29]Thank you very much.
[310:22.29]It's sold.

[311:09.65]Alright.
[311:10.61]Composite bow, we're doing... 6400.
[311:18.41]Perfect!
[311:20.45]You wanted to pay 220%.
[311:21.77]Alright, I'll take it.
[311:28.67]The price of sweets has increased.
[311:30.97]The price of swords has normalized.
[311:33.23]Okay, so all the swords are normal now.
[311:36.31]Everything else is still there, so I'll get... But weapons are all still... It's still a weapon.
[311:42.64]Sweet, alright, I have... Oh, and wait a minute.
[311:46.58]I should have bought it.
[311:49.72]I should have bought the cakes.
[311:56.71]I can still buy the cakes.
[311:59.47]Is it too late?
[312:00.17]No, it's too late.
[312:04.98]Alright, while there's still time, I'm going to put... I'm going to sell more weapons.
[312:13.14]Sell the long sword while swords are still expensive.
[312:19.11]If I know, the market's closed.
[312:23.51]The store's closed.
[312:24.85]It's closed.
[312:27.27]I can't do it.
[312:27.67]It's closed.
[312:29.91]Why are there toothpicks out here?
[312:35.71]Here we go.
[312:44.31]214.
[312:50.45]Tomorrow morning?
[312:50.99]Yeah, I'm gonna buy as many cakes, as many sweets as I can purchase.

[313:01.19]Yep.
[313:02.59]Finally got rid of that wand.

[314:43.59]Don't tell me the haggling was wrong.
[314:44.93]Unless tomorrow, if we wake up in the morning and sweets are down, then that was a really, really big mistake.
[314:50.46]Then I will agree with you.

[318:46.87]No, 225.
[318:47.11]Alright, now, put the... Housewives with new money management skills are on a precious metals bender.
[319:05.14]Price of weapons has normalized.
[319:06.62]Okay, as long as sweets are still expensive.
[319:12.26]I'm- I'm the durian guy.
[319:19.23]Engaged in plebian labor as always.
[319:39.64]Are you going somewhere again?
[319:41.12]Indeed I am.
[319:41.58]Father and I are off to have some truffles.
[319:45.59]Puffles.
[319:47.19]And you don't even know what a truffle is.
[319:49.65]It's to be expected of a pauper, I suppose.
[319:51.45]How distressing.
[319:52.91]Well, then this time I shall instruct you personally.
[319:57.61]Truff-kay.
[319:59.37]Is this Dr. Steve Brule?
[320:02.16]Truffle.
[320:02.72]Truffle.
[320:03.80]Truffle or truff-kay.
[320:09.97]Oh, yes, you should be thankful.
[320:13.69]Anyway, listen well.
[320:14.57]Truffles are mushrooms.
[320:21.34]Reset.
[320:21.88]Do you want a mushroom or not?
[320:24.34]Yes, that's it.
[320:25.54]Sell mushrooms.
[320:26.12]Okay, thanks, Alouette.
[320:26.92]I feel smarter already.
[320:27.90]Alright, well then, pardon moi.
[320:28.94]That was the most awkward conversation I think we've had in the game so far.
[320:36.23]Maybe I'm too used to tears and long explanations of things.
[320:42.90]I'd like some clothes.
[320:47.30]Got a windbreaker right here for you.
[320:50.88]That's it.
[320:51.69]That's the one.
[320:53.79]$600, please.
[320:57.47]Alright.
[321:08.74]He talked all that shit about the mushrooms.
[321:12.44]245%.
[321:12.88]Enjoy your truffles!
[321:20.76]I can probably buy some now too.
[321:24.46]This.
[321:25.56]Here we go.
[321:26.56]This is what I did this for.
[321:31.99]$17,000.
[321:32.97]That's why I bought these.
[321:36.43]That's... I've already paid for both of them.
[321:39.21]Twice.
[321:47.38]Ooh.
[321:49.59]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[321:52.07]I'll take that.
[321:52.91]I can take that.
[321:53.63]10 grand.
[322:00.96]Somebody bought the durian.
[322:07.04]No, I know what these are worth.
[322:10.60]I'll give you 100.
[322:10.94]I'll give you 800 for it.
[322:22.06]Ooh!
[322:22.80]No!
[322:23.22]Mommy asked for you to sell this!
[322:31.69]You little shit!
[322:43.06]Durian.
[322:44.54]I need to get a ring.
[322:45.40]That's why I bought the ring.
[322:53.22]That'll be fine.
[322:53.84]12,000.
[322:55.10]No, because it was blue.
[323:05.80]I forget we all get the same investor newsletters.
[323:10.16]I need two metal things?
[323:17.14]Everyone's losing faith in the sweets market.
[323:18.92]This is not good.
[323:20.72]The price of armor has decreased.
[323:23.20]The price of sweets has normalized.
[323:25.48]It's alright.
[323:26.14]I made 17 grand.
[323:27.40]I can still sell this for like 10.
[323:29.40]I can still sell this for... It's alright.
[323:33.65]I got plenty of peach tins that I can... I get fucked by this market.
[323:38.37]I'll be real with you guys.
[323:43.17]Everyone was buying...
[323:52.36]It's alright.
[323:52.90]I can... What is expensive now?
[323:55.14]Nothing?
[323:57.76]Get the vase back up here.
[324:01.20]Get a couple of weapons, maybe.
[324:02.30]Get a couple of weapons.
[324:05.68]Nah, nah.
[324:06.48]I'll put a long sword up there.
[324:08.02]Why not?
[324:08.70]Then let's, uh...
[324:18.13]Nah, just get in here.
[324:19.07]Somebody will buy it.
[324:19.59]Come on.
[324:25.31]I like something metal.
[324:32.34]Is iron made out of metal?
[324:35.96]Iron is metal, right?
[324:41.10]Yes, right?
[324:42.34]No, it's not.
[324:42.94]But I mean, what do they classify as metal in this game?
[324:48.36]Is wood made out of metal?
[324:49.46]I'm kidding.
[324:50.78]Magnet?
[324:51.38]That's metal.
[324:52.25]A magnet's a metal.
[324:55.01]A ring is made out of metal.
[325:10.97]I just don't know if this game, like, does this game, like, qualify?
[325:15.78]What is it quantifying?
[325:19.04]rings and gold are not metal in this game vending machine okay here this is made out of metal is it it could be
[325:51.04]Oh, Durian!
[325:55.96]I'm at least going to make back what I said.
[325:57.20]120.
[325:57.22]What do you mean, what the heck, too much?
[326:00.54]9,000.
[326:03.62]What the fuck?
[326:04.36]It's all coming down.
[326:05.08]I don't think this might sell.
[326:11.43]Thank you very much.
[326:16.51]I bought it.
[326:22.39]I really need a treasure.
[326:23.29]I got just the thing.
[326:27.24]Take this $22,000, please.
[326:28.06]It's perfect.
[326:28.82]Alright, don't blow this.
[326:31.12]20... No.
[326:31.24]22,500.
[326:31.28]Alright, we're back.
[326:52.24]You can dump the ashes if you want.
[326:53.92]Oh my god, that was terrible.
[326:57.44]Is the ring... Did I already get rid of the ring?
[327:00.50]There it is.
[327:02.77]Okay, now this is the problem.
[327:04.43]I have to sell this for a little bit lower.
[327:07.93]Because it's a shitty market for rings.
[327:16.40]I bought this for... How much did I buy this for?
[327:23.09]I bought it for 6,000.
[327:23.49]So let me get 80.
[327:28.29]90.
[327:32.87]Oh, come on.
[327:36.01]1,000 more than what I bought it for.
[327:36.93]You've got to be kidding me.
[327:43.17]Can I make 200 bucks here?
[327:44.33]I made 500 bucks.
[327:52.81]Lost the combo.
[327:53.83]I got plenty of money.
[327:55.55]Next one's 80.
[327:56.01]So that means by the time that the payment comes around, I need $160,000.
[328:06.34]I want to be times two in front of this.
[328:07.76]Congratulations.
[328:25.58]I'm ready.
[328:30.41]Oh yeah, it's the robot.
[328:39.27]Okay.
[328:41.01]Alright.
[328:41.94]Oh, I think Durian can stay up there.
[328:47.71]We're in a shit market right now.
[328:50.53]Alright, now... I'm gonna go down... I'm gonna attack.
[328:55.02]Hold on.
[328:55.38]Let's do a thing.
[329:02.42]I overheard some of the customers discussing removal of someone near the fountain attempting to sell overpriced items.
[329:08.48]Like what?
[329:08.86]New character.
[329:10.16]Hey, you there!
[329:34.72]Uh, can we help you?
[329:36.18]You two look like you have good taste.
[329:37.88]Tell me, what do you think of these?
[329:40.69]They're pictures postcards.
[329:43.21]Oh, the sea.
[329:43.97]These are quite well drawn, to be honest.
[329:46.52]Aren't they?
[329:48.16]Now, wouldn't you love having a few of these on hand at all times?
[329:51.89]But I don't think they match my stamps or anything I own now that I think about it.
[329:57.12]Nonsense.
[329:57.56]They'll look perfect with any stamp in the world.
[329:59.92]Or you could pin them up on your wall.
[330:01.52]Use them as pictures.
[330:03.32]Or perhaps I could interest you in something else.
[330:04.98]I'm sure I have something you'll just adore.
[330:07.75]I don't know.
[330:08.67]I don't know.
[330:09.21]What's the asking price for one of these postcards?
[330:11.99]$500,000.
[330:13.11]Might as well suggest we return home now.
[330:19.50]Wait, wait, wait, wait, I'll make a wonderful heirloom, and the price will only go up, you know?
[330:23.54]It's an investment, really.
[330:25.74]Somehow I doubt that.
[330:28.58]Wait, please, wait!
[330:30.47]You've got it all wrong!
[330:34.31]It's a da Vinci!
[330:35.05]It's a Leonardo da Vinci!
[330:43.85]Why the hell is that old Yuria charm hauling them in?
[330:51.13]I totally had that little air-headed brat figured for an easy mark, too.
[330:58.29]Friggin' fairy.
[331:00.19]And now I'm all worn out, too.
[331:03.02]And there's some rich, foolish adventurer out there with more money than good sense.
[331:07.78]I'm dying here.
[331:12.36]Cool, that old guy gives really big bonuses.
[331:14.66]So, what to do for lunch?
[331:17.70]Hey, you there, Mr. Cool Swordsman.
[331:19.40]Hi.
[331:20.58]Oh, are you talking to me?
[331:22.34]You bet I am.
[331:22.88]Listen, I've got an offer for you.
[331:31.58]That's a big e-key.
[331:35.41]When I was little, I used to come here a lot.
[331:37.73]Really, I must admit, you do not strike me as the... I've already did this.
[331:42.11]I feel like the church has no purpose.
[331:44.77]Maybe later?
[331:46.74]Alright, let's go.
[331:47.51]Level 15.
[331:49.17]Shell chest piece.
[331:50.93]No, no, no.
[331:52.01]I'm just going to get you a good weapon.
[331:54.85]What is this shit?
[331:55.79]Knight's blade.
[331:57.99]Pure edge.
[331:58.75]I'm just going to give it to you.
[332:04.28]I want it.
[332:10.02]This is expensive stuff.
[332:13.13]Sand Charm, these are... Silver Helm, these are priced pretty well.
[332:18.80]Scale Hat, get it.
[332:21.76]Night Shield, these are all cheap.
[332:23.26]Big Shield.
[332:25.38]Strong Arm Band, just buy up some stuff, but not that much.
[332:28.56]Silver Arm, this is crazy.
[332:31.01]Steel Breastplate, get it.
[332:33.29]Wizard Rope, get it.
[332:34.19]Okay, that's enough, that's enough.
[332:35.39]Silk Clothes, one more.
[332:37.63]Silver Gauntlet, last one.
[332:43.21]That's it.
[332:43.51]That's it.
[332:44.45]That was so cheap, I had to.
[332:55.28]Have I unlocked any other rank 2 things?
[333:00.38]Rank 1 helm.
[333:02.91]Rank 1 muffler.
[333:03.77]Rank 2 sword.
[333:04.77]No.
[333:06.29]Rank 2 dagger.
[333:07.01]I have the pure edge.
[333:12.45]Still don't know what this stuff is.
[333:14.69]Gunpowder, red oil.
[333:15.83]Look at how much gunpowder that is.
[333:21.72]Okay.
[333:23.34]Now.
[333:24.86]This is important.
[333:28.36]I need to do this shit.
[333:33.16]Take this.
[333:37.07]Take the breastplate.
[333:42.82]Take the strong arm band.
[333:47.27]Alright.
[333:48.01]And that's good.
[333:52.17]I'm going for it.
[333:53.79]Floor 11 to 15.
[333:54.98]If I die here, this is a huge problem.
[334:02.34]Food.
[334:02.68]Food, you're right.
[334:03.18]I didn't take any food.
[334:05.01]Thank you for stopping me.
[334:10.34]We're going to take a cherry.
[334:12.36]We're going to take a chocolate bar.
[334:16.50]We're going to take some walnut bread.
[334:18.18]And we're going to take the apple.
[334:19.84]I'm taking a lot of items, but it's very important that I don't lose.
[334:24.16]Save the game.
[334:24.80]You know what?
[334:25.18]That's even smarter.
[334:29.93]Holy shit, that would have been horrible.
[334:32.51]I get too into it.
[334:38.39]I get too into it.
[334:48.14]What else do I want?
[334:48.88]Anything?
[334:51.44]Apple.
[334:52.50]Cherry.
[334:53.54]Walnut bread.
[334:55.28]And the candy.
[334:57.50]Alright, here we go.
[334:59.30]Floor 11 to 15.
[334:59.99]I'm ready.
[335:02.79]Equip the items.
[335:07.19]Everything equipped.
[335:08.15]Just double check.
[335:10.61]I got good shit.
[335:16.30]Oh god.
[335:16.80]Okay, I already took too much damage.
[335:31.24]Just do it slow.
[335:32.36]There's no reason to go fast.
[335:39.35]This ain't a speedrun.
[335:40.91]This is a regular run.
[335:58.49]I'm gonna try to get to 16.
[336:02.82]Games done normally.
[336:04.40]That's right.
[336:10.18]Best attacker.
[336:13.41]Games done at your leisure.
[336:14.75]Down here.
[336:31.45]Ooh, that would have been bad.
[336:32.57]He would have hit me.
[336:36.79]Nice double crit.
[336:39.47]Oh, that's a triple crit right there.
[336:40.87]Oh, pretty good.
[336:43.09]I still got hit.
[336:43.65]It's alright.
[336:44.93]That armor is really, really good.
[336:53.36]Game's done with Pizazz.
[336:54.80]I like that.
[336:55.44]That's good.
[337:12.15]I gotta do Boss Rush to get the Slime Liver, and then... That'll get me in a pretty decent spot, right?
[337:22.66]This feels bigger than the other ones.
[337:25.10]It very well may be.
[337:29.60]Oh, shit.
[337:29.90]Just give me the exit.
[337:45.83]I'm fine.
[337:46.19]Just get me out of here.
[337:55.48]Twelve.
[337:55.86]I didn't wrap that around him.
[338:01.85]That's pretty cool.
[338:16.68]Chat is so predictable, are they?
[338:18.38]What do they say?
[338:19.38]I'm not looking at it right now.
[338:31.02]Turn the lookout.
[338:31.68]Oh, no.
[338:32.40]Well, that's like $10,000 right there.
[338:48.90]He's wearing earpods.
[338:58.71]That really is... I don't think that level would not be funny.
[339:09.82]Ow.
[339:09.96]Ooh, what's this?
[339:12.02]Water crystal.
[339:24.83]Mind fluid?
[339:25.43]No, I don't need that shit.
[339:28.39]Ooh, parade helm.
[339:33.50]Alright, this is worth money.
[339:34.62]17, almost.
[339:36.20]What's that?
[339:37.80]I can work with it.
[339:57.23]The ESP sound is driving me insane.
[340:00.79]This is kind of grating, isn't it?
[340:02.27]What is hitting me?
[340:05.33]What the hell was that?
[340:07.13]So is there... I'm gonna assume there's probably only 15 of those.
[340:34.86]Total.
[340:37.95]Whoa, that's what happens when you look at chat.
[340:40.37]Glad I only took a small amount of damage.
[340:44.57]That would have been bad.
[340:47.71]Trying to go too fast.
[340:48.79]I have a lot of confidence right now, which is bad.
[340:51.65]You never want to feel confident in a game like this.
[340:53.45]You always want to be nervous, biting your nails, and scared around every single corner.
[341:04.65]fish cookie it would be funny if he walked off the edge hahaha I would donate 2000 bits you can't even walk off the edge I'm stuck here you can't walk off the edge it doesn't work like that wouldn't it be funny
[341:47.24]What time is it right now?
[341:49.55]We're getting to those late hours, aren't we?
[341:53.13]Around, what, midnight Eastern?
[341:55.95]I'm still good to go.
[341:59.97]I'm in this for the long haul tonight.
[342:02.89]I need to know.
[342:11.52]I just need to know what happens after 200.
[342:12.56]I just took 55 damage without just having...
[342:26.32]I know I'm about to level up, but I'm scared to get, like, double tapped and die.
[342:34.20]Oh, forget it.
[342:40.34]Remember to hydrate and eat.
[342:44.81]I've already eaten tonight.
[342:47.33]Right before the stream started, I ate a full meal, so I'll be good for a little while.
[342:51.53]I'll be good for, like, another few hours.
[343:07.25]Pretty good.
[343:09.77]I'm just gonna go.
[343:11.19]I'm gonna try to get to the boss.
[343:15.82]That's the next floor.
[343:20.04]And then it's all about the slime.
[343:22.46]I'm gonna just do boss rush, get the slime.
[343:26.43]See if I can progress that part of the game.
[343:32.97]trash.
[343:34.07]Corn cob pipe.
[343:34.97]I don't know if those cigarettes, where the hell they are.
[343:40.74]Alright, so now they're pretty much the same level.
[343:50.26]One more.
[344:04.43]Okay.
[344:06.13]Uh, no.
[344:08.75]Not yet.
[344:09.05]I can probably get to 19.
[344:11.66]Before fighting the boss.
[344:25.11]He's so addicted.
[344:28.19]Well, yeah.
[344:29.25]Come on.
[344:32.38]When was the last time I was addicted to a game?
[344:36.68]And I wanted to do it for, like, more than a couple streams.
[344:53.28]Fortnite.
[344:53.82]Alright, that's what I wanted.
[344:54.78]Time to go.
[344:55.14]Level 19.
[345:00.40]Don't let him play Animal Crossing.
[345:06.94]Yeah, but that's just as fun.
[345:10.81]I am a sucker for games with just slow drip trickling upgrades.
[345:20.14]That just doesn't fool me.
[345:21.46]The gauntlet.
[345:22.12]Nobody here but us.
[345:24.40]What do I mean, the gauntlet?
[345:32.83]Holy shit, okay.
[345:36.31]This is not a boss that doesn't dump a bunch of enemies at you.
[345:39.67]Oh my god.
[345:41.25]Pretty good move to have here, though.
[345:51.22]More?
[345:53.90]It is called the gauntlet.
[345:56.88]Yeah.
[345:59.96]Oh, fuck.
[346:04.19]Too many!
[346:04.95]Too many!
[346:07.24]Explosion!
[346:10.68]Watch it!
[346:11.92]Uh-oh!
[346:16.14]What's that?
[346:16.52]Fruit?
[346:17.82]Grapes!
[346:22.62]I can't carry anymore.
[346:23.58]I gotta wait until after this is over.
[346:28.53]Tons of Batwings.
[346:42.01]There's more of this shit down here.
[346:43.33]Uh, I might level up.
[346:49.26]These bat wings are not that important, but... Oh, Jesus.
[346:55.30]Oh, no.
[346:56.04]There's four of them.
[346:57.96]I'm gonna heal.
[347:10.31]Holy shit.
[347:11.07]They're gonna explode on me.
[347:15.79]Once one of them dies, then... They explode, and it causes a huge problem.
[347:26.82]Oh, shit.
[347:32.26]Like that.
[347:35.05]Thank god.
[347:38.09]Did it.
[347:41.05]Alright, so this gunpowder... Uh... no.
[347:50.96]No, I don't need the bat wings.
[347:52.12]I don't know.
[347:52.52]I don't need them.
[347:54.34]But they might be worth more than the shit that I have.
[347:56.96]Like a piece of candy is not worth it.
[348:00.04]Rusty dagger, just throw it away.
[348:03.44]Slime fluid, get rid of it.
[348:08.18]Walnut bread, just eat it.
[348:09.26]Okay.
[348:20.62]No other items or anything?
[348:28.09]No.
[348:29.35]Why did the door open?
[348:38.71]All the way back here.
[348:41.49]Yeah, I'm pulling out.
[348:43.51]There it is.
[348:51.63]I can't risk it.
[348:52.99]The items I have are too good.
[348:56.71]I gotta pee again.
[348:58.75]Well, it's been three hours.
[348:59.69]I heard this girl has been handing out advice to people lately.
[349:04.73]Yeah, and here's that dude, right?
[349:07.95]Town square.
[349:08.41]We're gonna see that guy again.
[349:10.39]Good evening.
[349:12.97]Leaving stroll.
[349:13.85]Goodbye.
[349:17.37]Good night.
[349:24.70]How did I lose $50,000?
[349:25.30]What did I do?
[349:32.15]The price of long swords has increased.
[349:35.44]The price of accessories has normalized.
[349:37.24]Alright.
[349:38.62]Hire an adventurer at the Adventurer's Guild.
[349:40.62]Yes, I know that.
[349:41.30]Alright, long swords.
[349:45.37]Steel sword, get it out there.
[349:46.53]What else is worth money?
[349:51.99]I'm gonna pee.
[349:54.39]Yeah, I gotta pee.
[349:54.95]Alright, I'll be right back.
[349:56.69]I'm gonna pee.
[350:30.25]you
[351:25.37]Thank you.
[353:52.76]Back to it.
[354:00.46]What are you guys doing?
[354:08.97]Oh, what?
[354:10.89]I didn't know that we would be in late night.
[354:14.09]Jerks.
[354:14.49]Alright, I got a bunch of new stuff.
[354:20.36]In fact, I want to sell this stuff first.
[354:24.71]Don't I have- I have orders, right?
[354:28.47]Due date passed.
[354:31.83]Was I in the dungeon?
[354:34.11]Whatever.
[354:35.35]A bunch of foodstuff and two metal things.
[354:39.05]By tomorrow.
[354:39.67]So I need two foodstuffs.
[354:42.21]Four.
[354:42.95]I got all- I have a lot of that shit.
[354:49.35]I heard you screaming in the bathroom.
[354:50.75]Is everything alright?
[354:51.37]Yeah, everything's fine.
[354:55.70]I'll be alright.
[355:01.41]I'm the guy who ordered foodstuffs.
[355:06.03]I mean, okay, but you could be a little more specific.
[355:08.95]Is that on the durian?
[355:20.09]No, someone will buy that durian.
[355:23.64]You weren't here the day I came to get my order.
[355:25.78]That's bad business, Missy.
[355:30.78]Whatever.
[355:31.78]Alright.
[355:32.00]Let's do 200%, 208.
[355:32.46]I want to get the little 15.
[355:33.50]There we go.
[355:35.48]10... 109.
[355:53.61]Fuck!
[355:54.35]No, was that a buy?
[356:00.20]That was a buy, wasn't it?
[356:01.10]No, it wasn't.
[356:05.12]No, okay.
[356:06.66]This is a buy.
[356:07.20]It was a sell.
[356:20.65]Hey, look at that.
[356:24.18]Told you it was worth holding on to the durian.
[356:25.54]12,000.
[356:26.80]There it is.
[356:35.04]Price gouger.
[356:44.48]Combo.
[356:45.70]Come on.
[356:46.76]15.
[356:46.78]Almost there.
[356:47.22]One more sale.
[356:53.52]I'm running an errand.
[356:54.95]Ooh, okay.
[356:55.61]110.
[356:56.31]What do I get at 15?
[357:00.35]The vending machine.
[357:06.89]Do you have my foodstuffs?
[357:09.35]I do.
[357:10.11]Welcome back.
[357:10.75]Let me get rid of these peach tins that I bought too many of during the boom.
[357:23.33]126.
[357:23.63]You'll do it.
[357:24.05]Nice.
[357:30.42]Alright.
[357:31.80]Now let's put the vending machine in.
[357:34.24]A moment, if you will.
[357:34.98]No, quite well.
[357:37.84]I simply thought it was time to explain how to place and use vending machines.
[357:42.56]Vending machines allow you to sell a larger volume of items in a shorter amount of time compared to handling each customer yourself.
[357:50.44]Okay.
[357:52.25]To place a vending machine, choose the vending machine from the item placement menu at the counter as if it were a normal item.
[357:58.45]The counter will become that vending machine.
[358:00.67]And after I put it down, it just starts selling stuff.
[358:07.97]No, you'll have to keep the machine stocked yourself.
[358:10.11]There is a limit to how much you can place in a vending machine as well, so be mindful of what you put inside.
[358:16.97]Okay.
[358:17.29]There's a downside, however.
[358:19.95]Because the vending machine is automatic, the price of an item sold from a vending machine cannot be negotiated.
[358:25.85]Items will sell for their base price.
[358:28.62]Keep that in mind.
[358:32.00]Alright.
[358:34.32]It is a drawback.
[358:34.98]The extra volume can often make up for the lower price.
[358:37.18]However, so far, cheap items... A vending machine is helpful.
[358:44.35]I'm just gonna get like four of them.
[358:47.96]Finally, remember that we cannot sell off the machines ourselves.
[358:51.41]If you wish to dispose of a machine, we must sell it back to the merchant's guild or market at a steep loss.
[358:57.41]Keep that in mind if you decide to invest in one.
[359:02.83]Alright, well let's get it over here.
[359:05.57]What should I put in it?
[359:06.21]I think I want it right here, right in the front door.
[359:13.69]Right there.
[359:14.53]Or right here, right at the end.
[359:20.94]I think right in the front door.
[359:27.70]Peach tins.
[359:28.46]Yams.
[359:38.37]I think I could probably just stock up on peach tin.
[359:41.75]I'm going to put it right here.
[359:45.11]Where is it?
[359:48.75]Old vendor.
[359:51.18]Whoa.
[359:52.26]It's the whole thing.
[359:54.16]What?
[359:55.66]Oh.
[359:56.76]Okay.
[359:58.42]Is it two?
[359:59.04]This is like the apple machine.
[360:14.17]And like chocolate.
[360:15.19]And fish.
[360:18.31]Do cheap stuff.
[360:25.19]Cheap shit.
[360:26.70]But what if it just automatically sells these for me?
[360:29.10]I think that's worth it for me.
[360:41.52]Peach tins won't sell in there.
[360:42.94]What about like raincoats?
[360:54.21]We're getting rid of just cheap shit.
[360:55.49]Alright.
[360:55.83]Well, I don't really have that much cheap shit.
[360:57.43]I mean, unthankful statue.
[361:00.43]I got like slime fluids.
[361:06.35]I got a bunch of shitty slime.
[361:11.30]Anti-venom.
[361:15.90]Toothpicks.
[361:19.46]Alright.
[361:25.95]It's a toothpick machine.
[361:27.19]This is dumb.
[361:28.51]Dumb stocking.
[361:34.49]Who the hell is going to buy that shit?
[361:48.82]Let's get... I want to keep pure edge.
[361:53.10]There's no booming markets right now, so...
[362:00.81]Yeah, there's no blooming markets.
[362:02.91]Markets are boring today.
[362:03.93]I have so many anti-venom.
[362:10.22]I'm gonna have to put... I'm gonna stalk that machine with anti-venom.
[362:16.26]Go back and adventure?
[362:17.06]I could do that.
[362:21.83]What do I got?
[362:22.37]I got... What's today?
[362:24.37]I got plenty of time.
[362:25.17]I have plenty of money.
[362:31.89]Oh, here he is!
[362:33.73]You're doing okay!
[362:35.71]Oh, Elon.
[362:36.75]Welcome.
[362:37.19]You finally came.
[362:38.53]Well, I can't afford anything expensive, but I thought I'd drop by to give you my card!
[362:43.42]You're alright.
[362:43.96]Should we test this guy out?
[362:50.40]I guess you two haven't met.
[362:52.41]This is Tyr.
[362:53.01]She's my business partner here at the store.
[362:54.47]Tyr, this is Elon, an adventurer.
[362:56.51]For the record, we do not accept payments on tab.
[362:58.23]Yep, yep, yep.
[362:58.95]Give me the card.
[363:01.73]right oh no he doesn't do it yet I don't think he even did it I'm not sure he did it I need two metal things oh somebody bought something mommy asked me to sell this what do you mean really that cheap
[363:30.19]You're getting... you're getting what I pay.
[363:34.21]Little lady, you got some food?
[363:37.59]I do.
[363:41.21]I do, I have some peach tins.
[363:43.01]Okay.
[363:45.54]Another sale of slime.
[364:02.69]Dump all my peach tins.
[364:05.89]Just get rid of these dumb things.
[364:07.75]Oh, rich girl.
[364:31.10]I've been enjoying this a lot more than I thought I would.
[364:34.34]Now that makes two of us.
[364:35.26]This item's for sale.
[364:38.19]It is.
[364:38.55]1700.
[364:39.77]Oh, shit.
[364:41.89]I just broke my record.
[364:43.25]I think it's time to go deeper down into the dungeon.
[364:59.23]That's 92 slices, right?
[365:00.83]I don't think I can do it anymore.
[365:04.33]No, I can.
[365:05.65]19.
[365:07.62]Yeah, let's go down.
[365:10.26]Let's keep going.
[365:17.58]And what's that new steel breastplate?
[365:20.54]Bring a little bit of food.
[365:21.44]I'll bring the fish.
[365:29.35]I'll bring... What else I got?
[365:32.31]I got some bread, right?
[365:33.19]Cherries, bread.
[365:34.29]Alright, that's good.
[365:39.38]Close.
[365:40.02]16 to 20.
[365:47.58]12 hours.
[365:47.86]Damn it.
[365:48.80]I'm so glad I have you guys here to yell at me.
[365:55.57]Here we go.
[365:57.68]I need the slime, boss!
[365:58.88]I need the slime!
[366:01.39]After this.
[366:04.65]This is definitely the end of the garden.
[366:08.98]SP consumption halved.
[366:09.98]Let's go!
[366:24.37]Ooh, that wasn't cool.
[366:27.33]Wasn't cool.
[366:31.41]Third move?
[366:32.73]Yep.
[366:33.85]You turn into a spider?
[366:35.99]What is this?
[366:37.58]Oh, it's the spider web.
[366:39.42]That's the move that she used on us when we first found her.
[366:53.23]I think blend it in with the background.
[366:54.47]Come on.
[366:59.49]Easy.
[367:01.54]I can have more than one clone?
[367:03.14]Yeah, just for some reason my brain just doesn't click and do it.
[367:06.32]I don't know why.
[367:07.06]Yeah, that's really cool.
[367:12.74]How many can I have?
[367:22.29]I can have as many as I want?
[367:31.62]Which one's the real one?
[367:40.24]No, that's overpowered.
[367:42.16]Well, I also have half consumption of M.E.S.P.
[367:44.94]or whatever.
[367:46.91]Magic power, special power, whatever you want to call it.
[368:00.63]Don't want those.
[368:06.73]What?
[368:07.01]I want one of these rings.
[368:10.67]Who's dropping those rings?
[368:29.57]Ow.
[368:37.45]I'm looking over at you guys.
[368:40.92]Seeing what everybody was saying.
[368:44.74]Why am I talking in end of the stream voice?
[368:46.72]Well, it's getting late.
[368:48.29]I'm kind of just chilling and playing at this point.
[368:51.07]I'm just kind of having fun.
[368:57.50]Plus, there's not much to really say when you're doing this part.
[369:01.24]You're just gonna have to kill stuff.
[369:09.25]Ow.
[369:16.55]He put himself in low power mode.
[369:19.30]Yeah, this is low battery mode.
[369:26.67]I was doing too many voices and making too many fuckin' 90's movie references, so you turned me down.
[369:33.20]I was at like 19% and you were like, holy shit, he's gonna die.
[369:35.66]There we go.
[369:36.10]There she is again.
[369:58.51]This is the second time we've run into her down here.
[370:02.03]What a coincidence!
[370:03.81]Oh, how are you?
[370:04.43]Oh, he went.
[370:06.21]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[370:06.65]Yeah, we've already done this.
[370:08.87]Have a nice life, bye.
[370:09.69]You're your own worst enemy, Jeremy.
[370:23.34]Nobody else.
[370:39.61]Don't sell weapons in your store.
[370:43.03]Adventurers will ask for weapons.
[370:47.21]Yeah, I've noticed that too.
[370:49.15]They kind of just come in and they say, hey, do you have this?
[370:58.90]Oh, forget it.
[371:00.62]Actually, you know what?
[371:07.27]free experience, why not take it, right?
[371:16.29]Worthless.
[371:22.97]Yeah, and I can't just lend the weapon, too, but in a perfect world, they come in and ask for it, or they want to buy it, so then not only do you don't have to equip it on them every time, but they also pay you for it.
[371:56.14]Don't blow up on me.
[371:57.25]Don't, don't, don't.
[371:59.21]Okay.
[372:00.45]17?
[372:01.71]This is 18.
[372:02.25]What?
[372:26.83]Put on a Christmas OST?
[372:30.26]No.
[372:31.30]No Christmas songs.
[372:33.64]Look, it's already getting late for people.
[372:37.68]I don't want to put people to sleep.
[372:38.94]If people was just relaxing right now, I'm like, you know, relax.
[372:44.79]You want me to like put people to bed?
[372:59.93]I'd rather you do the thing where your eyes close, and then your, like, face goes forward, and your iPad hits you in the chest, and you catch yourself really quick.
[373:08.61]You fall asleep for, like, .3 seconds, and your eyes, you rip your eyes open, you sit back up.
[373:13.81]I'd rather you do that.
[373:14.45]If I start playing Christmas music, you're all, you're all gonna be gone.
[373:33.62]What if I turn on Christmas music and people just get, like, lit the fuck up?
[373:41.17]It's possible.
[373:46.23]Just played a Muppets Christmas Carol.
[373:48.43]Entire OST.
[373:49.17]People are gonna start losing their minds in here.
[374:13.12]Ah, shit.
[374:14.76]No, I don't know why I just started talking about it, and then I just started to go, like, sleepy.
[374:19.06]Why did that happen?
[374:20.96]No, no.
[374:21.74]It's only been, like, six hours and fifteen- I'm- Everything's fine.
[374:29.88]No.
[374:30.62]It's not time yet.
[374:31.62]It's not time- It's not my time for bed.
[374:34.30]Jeremy, go to bed.
[374:35.29]No!
[374:35.55]I need to stay- Can I stay for, like, another hour?
[374:41.55]Please, Mom?
[374:51.03]Trash.
[374:56.10]Okay, five more minutes.
[374:58.14]Five more minutes.
[374:58.92]Oh, cool.
[375:01.50]She comes back like 45 minutes later.
[375:04.74]Okay, it's been five minutes.
[375:08.39]No, come on, please!
[375:15.53]I even gave you some extra time there.
[375:17.80]No, I didn't.
[375:18.52]You gave me like five... It was only ten minutes.
[375:22.54]I gotta pay attention.
[375:24.10]It's a crab.
[375:29.08]Oh, fuck.
[375:29.82]I'm gonna have to knock shit into him.

[375:40.47]Yep.
[375:41.77]And then here we go.
[375:46.33]Oh fuck, what have I done?
[375:47.11]I just freaked out.
[375:51.72]Alright.

[376:19.71]Come over here.
[376:20.07]Over here!
[376:20.55]Come on!
[376:21.83]Step, step, step, step, step.
[376:23.15]Okay.
[376:27.79]That's broken.
[376:29.01]That's absolutely broken.
[376:31.75]I just hit him with like nine people.
[376:33.11]Ooh, a cube.
[376:33.63]I'm gonna eat the candy.
[376:41.01]Yeah, let's get rid of the candy.
[376:44.71]Tough stone.
[376:47.01]Nice.
[376:48.69]Should I keep going?
[376:52.05]No.
[376:52.73]Not worth it.
[376:53.21]I don't want to lose the weapon.
[377:04.94]Pretty good day.
[377:05.38]Yeah, I gotta spend- I gotta make some money.
[377:09.76]Because this is where it absolutely- it derails if I don't have at least like two or three hundred thousand dollars soon here.
[377:18.85]Peach tins are falling rapidly.
[377:24.69]Really?
[377:26.57]I know what I'm doing.
[377:37.32]Ah, fuck.
[377:37.82]Just buy all the ham sandwiches I can afford.
[377:41.01]Alright, that's- I don't need any more than that.
[377:53.38]Let's see the, uh, whatever this is gonna be.
[377:58.36]This is the, oh, you throw fountain, you throw money in the fountain, why?
[378:01.44]Let's sell some shit.
[378:10.22]These are nice, 10,000 for the silver gauntlet.
[378:12.96]Yeah, get it up there.
[378:19.68]Oh, maybe I should just, no, maybe I should hold on to this.
[378:26.28]That might go way up soon.
[378:30.30]Armor, everything's all down.
[378:31.16]I mean, the markets, like, actually kind of suck, yeah.
[378:36.71]Swords are still alright.
[378:40.13]Hold on, can I... Hmm... No, I need... I gotta make some money.
[378:52.82]I gotta have a sale here.
[378:53.78]Let's put the sandals up there.
[378:56.86]Restock this stuff.
[378:57.80]Put some slime fluid in here.
[378:58.99]I mean, this is junk.
[379:02.97]Just put it in here.
[379:09.53]Rustic dagger.
[379:10.34]I don't want it.
[379:14.64]Slime fluid.
[379:15.44]Slime fluid.
[379:16.54]Alright.
[379:18.94]Let's get some sails here.
[379:25.05]Have you heard?
[379:25.55]Heard about what?
[379:26.87]A while ago, there was a coup d'etat in a certain kingdom.
[379:33.88]What?
[379:34.12]Aren't you interested even a little bit?
[379:35.54]Oh, whatever.
[379:37.18]Anyway, the king of that land was actually pretty popular.
[379:39.95]So many people have speculated that the coup was orchestrated by a rival kingdom and not the people.
[379:45.88]Is that so?
[379:46.28]You really aren't interested in this at all, are you?
[379:48.94]Why don't you care?
[379:49.52]Well, it just feels like it's so far away, you know?
[379:51.94]Like it could never be me.
[379:52.78]You're not talking about me!
[380:15.03]It's above the clouds or something.
[380:16.37]Why should it matter to me?
[380:17.57]I just own a store and I've debt.
[380:20.95]This is why you'll always be small time.
[380:23.67]What's my being short got to do with this?
[380:26.83]Listen, reset.
[380:28.83]A good merchant knows how to gather information from around the world, understand what it means, and put it to good use.
[380:34.78]Even things that seem trivial can be important in the long run.
[380:37.26]Therefore, the best merchants make it to their job, make it their job to gather from across the news and the world, and they go to all the Reddits, every one of them.
[380:44.67]They go to Reddit News.
[380:45.45]They go to Reddit... Interesting Gifts.
[380:48.01]They go to Reddit... Earth.
[380:51.38]They go to... They get their news and they get their information from all over the world.
[380:57.80]Okay, I guess that makes sense.
[380:58.84]Thanks.
[381:07.55]One last thing.
[381:08.15]Speaking of markets, that kingdom is known above all else for their very popular liquor.
[381:16.19]Well, I need to be gone.
[381:16.99]Pardon me.
[381:17.57]Alright.
[381:17.99]Bye-bye.
[381:19.68]Princesses and liquor.

[381:24.30]Oh, welcome.

[381:26.12]You wouldn't happen to have a street date for the newest issue of Booze of the World, would you?
[381:31.69]Booze of the World comes out every 25th.
[381:33.37]Do you want me to keep a copy for you?
[381:35.43]Nah, I'll just stop by and pick it up when I can.
[381:37.03]I have it.
[381:40.45]I own that.
[381:47.72]I need to get some food.
[381:48.50]My grandchild wants me to get food.
[381:54.17]Food is a bad... I'm gonna have to give you something crappy.
[381:58.91]Yeah, take the peach tin.

[388:31.46]I know it's only 10 p.m.
[388:32.63]Pacific, but that doesn't matter.
[388:34.29]I already did a monkey.

[389:42.24]Alright.
[389:51.02]Here comes the ever-looming.
[389:52.36]The price of precious metals has increased.
[389:55.37]The price of pieces of armor has normalized.
[390:02.88]A few more days, and then we get to the hard part.
[390:06.70]And as long as I do that, I'll be happy.
[390:09.10]And I can save the game right now in a decent spot.

[391:18.71]Alright.
[391:20.03]Slime.
[391:20.43]Did I get it?
[391:22.01]I did.
[391:23.49]Perfect.
[391:27.14]Slime literally two of these.
[391:28.28]Can I just leave?
[391:31.10]No, I have to... Well, a backscratcher is important too.
[391:33.78]Okay.
[391:56.72]Yes, I understand I'm doing this very, very poorly.
[392:02.07]It doesn't matter.
[392:02.61]This is the easy stuff.
[392:08.21]Just eat one.
[392:14.07]I broke the mushroom.
[392:18.69]Yes, I did.
[392:21.32]He's just clubbing me.
[392:28.69]Backscratcher.
[392:31.77]Did I watch Stranger Things?
[392:32.81]I have never seen Stranger Things.
[392:36.81]So, no.
[392:37.17]I have not seen one episode.
[392:39.55]Alright, don't lose here.
[392:49.16]Don't be stupid.
[393:15.36]Don't you fucking dare lose!
[393:32.49]Stranger Things is bad.
[393:39.45]I've never seen Stranger Things.
[393:41.55]I've heard it was a pretty good show.
[393:52.45]They're not?
[393:55.25]No.
[393:55.37]Okay, depart.
[393:56.77]I need one more of these.
[394:00.07]Bounce.
[394:04.94]Bounce.
[394:18.19]There it is.
[394:18.51]Alright, I got two.
[394:19.17]Cool.
[394:22.05]Just what I wanted.
[394:23.65]See if I can get the Backscratcher.
[394:31.51]Somebody on the internet told you something's bad.
[394:33.08]Did you just take their word for it?
[394:34.12]Nah, I... I know the show was supposed to be good.
[394:44.73]I just never really watched it.
[394:45.89]I think I've seen the first episode I thought the first episode was good.
[395:05.90]I didn't see anything wrong with the first episode.
[395:09.20]I was like, oh that was kind of cool
[395:19.70]Just eat one!
[395:20.33]You're making this hard.
[395:25.63]Go eat one of those.
[395:27.19]You're making me upset.
[395:29.83]Oh my god.
[395:31.29]What do I have to do to get you to eat that?
[395:35.88]Finally.
[395:40.44]Ooh, he dropped a tail.
[395:49.46]I don't think I've seen... I've not seen that item before.
[395:51.78]You're better off watching Twin Peaks.
[395:57.12]That's another show that I've never watched.
[395:58.37]Let's see if I can do something weird here.
[396:01.73]Got it.
[396:19.20]I don't really watch TV, that's a crime.
[396:24.59]So now I can craft that thing that I wanted to craft.
[396:28.19]Could you give us your best Jora impression?
[396:51.79]No, I'm sorry, I can't.
[397:06.58]I should replace that with this.
[397:15.38]Lots of accessories, very expensive.
[397:20.29]Get these yens out of here We're now an accessory store Go to the crap section there it is
[397:48.46]I still have all these bat wings in here.
[397:49.89]Alright, let's go.
[397:53.05]Okay.
[397:54.63]Open!
[397:58.55]Welcome to... Good day!
[398:02.67]Did you finally manage to get my order?
[398:04.33]I did.
[398:04.99]In the name of... Have you...
[398:15.28]No.
[398:16.08]I'm gonna do it.
[398:16.62]I'm gonna do it.
[398:17.16]It's, you know, it's, like, late, and, like, there are less people here right now, so they won't even know I did this.
[398:21.78]I was gonna do... Do-do-do.
[398:28.27]Alright.
[398:41.15]Did it.
[398:47.97]My watch stopped.
[398:51.27]What is this?
[398:51.75]Here I have a peek at my special merchandise.
[398:54.01]Is this bullshit?
[398:57.45]500% of base price!
[399:03.32]Excuse me.
[399:08.00]I'll do, I'll do like... I'll do like... 54.
[399:20.38]Ooh, here we go.
[399:21.24]Charm.

[399:22.68]221.
[399:23.74]Got it, got it, got it, got it!
[399:26.88]I'm gonna do that every time I make a sale.
[399:32.06]Hi there.
[399:32.44]Ooh, mommy asked me to sell this thing.
[399:35.61]It's too expensive, though.
[399:37.09]Sorry.
[399:40.65]No.
[399:41.83]I can't afford this.
[399:43.83]If you'll take 90... You know what?
[399:47.85]Listen to this.
[399:48.85]I'll give you 99%.
[399:49.39]I could just flip it for 25%.
[400:12.67]Ooh, I want the silver armor.
[400:14.18]20 grand.
[400:16.88]This is a big one.
[400:18.82]Although, she doesn't like to spend that kind of money.
[400:21.08]We'll do 180.
[400:29.23]She's very cheap.
[400:30.51]She doesn't do it.
[400:33.45]Got it.
[400:39.08]Who's next?
[400:41.00]You have my metal things.
[400:42.02]Uh-oh.
[400:47.13]Is that... Is silver a metal?
[400:51.35]What's a metal?
[400:51.87]What is metal?
[400:53.27]What is metal?
[400:54.23]What is metal?
[400:55.51]Metal.
[400:55.79]What is metal?
[401:00.61]What is metal?
[401:01.15]Is metal... What is metal?
[401:03.76]What is metal?
[401:04.30]Okay.
[401:04.78]It's...
[401:11.71]Is wood metal?
[401:13.39]Remember this one?
[401:15.23]Let's see, what's the most expensive metal that I have?
[401:18.25]Dude, you are fucked now.
[401:21.57]You're going to have to pay me a shitload of money.
[401:23.39]This is going to be the most expensive thing I've done in the game.
[401:42.94]Silver's not that.
[401:45.92]How?
[401:50.88]Precious metal.
[401:52.66]Metal.
[401:53.10]Oh.
[402:14.63]The price of daggers has increased.
[402:20.33]Alright, I'm at that point where I'm at 160,000, though.
[402:23.15]So... And then in the two days... Yeah, this is going well.
[402:27.89]I'm so happy about this.
[402:31.97]This is good shit, you know what I mean?
[402:39.51]I could sell this and just buy it again.
[402:40.67]I'm gonna sell this and then buy it again.
[402:45.98]How we doing over here?
[402:49.03]It's all about the cash flow now.
[402:53.93]Welcome to... Oh, great.
[403:15.70]Well, that's not true.
[403:19.82]I'm really very, very busy.
[403:21.10]Even if I do have my feet up on the counter.
[403:23.03]Right... Um... Typical.
[403:39.80]I have heard about that.
[403:40.90]The Chapel Masters have been seizing items that they claim have a corrupting influence on man's immortal soul.
[403:46.88]I believe the claim was.
[403:49.00]Yeah, spot on.
[403:50.20]Just what I'd expect of you, Madam Fairy.
[403:53.65]Hey, anyway, it's all, uh, super-fag-califragilisticexpialidocious nonsense.
[404:00.09]Interestingly, though, the items that the Chapel gathers for destruction, a lot of them are turning up in the dungeons, and I mean a lot.
[404:11.09]Why?
[404:13.32]Very good question.
[404:14.16]The dungeons have always been packed with mysterious... mysteries.
[404:18.28]However, so it may not be worth thinking about too hard.
[404:22.32]It does, however, present an opportunity which leads me to... a guild card.
[404:29.20]Ooh, you want us to give the items back to the Chapel Masters.
[404:34.45]Ugh.
[404:35.67]How can you be so dense and still be capable of breathing?
[404:39.52]Dense?
[404:40.80]Like a chocolate cake?
[404:42.56]I want to make sure that these items return to general circulation.
[404:46.34]The Chapel Masters are standing astride curiosity and knowledge, and I won't have it.
[404:51.58]If you help me, you can recover some of these to sell, while I lay hands on other things for study.
[404:58.78]The Chapel Masters won't try to seize property from a secular shop, so you would have nothing to worry about.
[405:07.11]Ah, of course.
[405:07.81]The Merchants Guild has jurisdiction over the behavior of the city's merchants, and the Guildmaster would never cede authority to anyone, so... so they can't touch us!
[405:19.60]Aren't city politics wonderfully headache-inducing?
[405:23.48]Regardless, Madame Fairy, you provide the material support, I provide the quite literal firepower.
[405:29.18]We go into a dungeon together and get what we need.
[405:31.44]Agreed?
[405:33.65]Well, we'll pay the adventurer fee for sure, but you'll have to buy what we find here in the shop, just like everybody else.
[405:42.01]Oh, man.
[405:44.60]You gotta be... Well, yeah, that's acceptable.
[405:47.94]I'm looking forward to seeing you in action.
[405:49.68]I expect a lot, Mr. Magician.
[405:52.98]You hardly need to worry on that front, Miss Counter-Jockey.
[405:58.94]Just make sure you can identify everything we find.
[406:00.54]Okay.
[406:04.95]This chat is a mess.
[406:06.47]Why?
[406:09.21]I'd like a weapon?
[406:10.33]Oh!
[406:11.01]Would you like a weapon?
[406:12.77]I got one for you!
[406:13.97]And it's the one that I want you to have.
[406:16.71]So badly.
[406:20.63]Do you have the cash to give me this?
[406:23.91]Let's just do straight 200%.
[406:24.57]Yes!
[406:33.32]Money is no longer a concern.
[406:36.16]Ooh, you selling this to me?
[406:38.10]I sure am.
[406:39.44]For $20,000.
[406:39.56]What else you got?
[406:40.18]Oof.
[406:40.36]How much for this?
[406:41.32]$14.50.
[406:41.66]Somebody buy that silver helm.
[406:47.52]Yes.
[407:06.96]21,000.
[407:06.98]The biggest day I've had.
[407:11.34]This is almost $100,000 in sales.
[407:12.92]I need two weapons.
[407:18.57]I'll come back in two days.
[407:28.29]You want to sell this to me? 45%.
[407:35.00]When do I owe the 200k?
[407:36.70]I owe 80 in a day or two, and then 200k.
[407:41.05]As long as I get over that hurdle, I'll be happy.
[407:45.55]I came by to sell this today.
[407:48.03]No.
[407:51.10]No.
[407:52.04]I mean, if you're willing to... No.
[407:58.40]If you're willing to go 78...
[408:02.07]70, yeah, 19,000.
[408:04.49]That's too cheap.
[408:05.31]Make the offer a little bit better.
[408:06.41]Alright, 21.
[408:08.55]21,000.
[408:10.49]Alright, I got it.
[408:11.35]I did it.
[408:11.83]I got it.
[408:12.15]207.
[408:28.22]It's going down tomorrow?
[408:29.12]That's cool because tomorrow is not even right now.
[408:32.56]It's still today.
[408:42.92]That was meaty.
[408:51.73]I want to put in the anti-venom here now.
[408:53.35]I have way too much of this shit.
[408:58.61]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[409:00.09]No, no, okay, we're done.
[409:04.12]Big shiny thing.
[409:09.99]Shiny thing.
[409:10.63]What am I going to do?
[409:14.51]This game is going to make me watch anime.
[409:18.90]Get the iron up there.
[409:19.76]A couple more pieces of iron.
[409:22.64]Let me check the... Joel raid incoming?
[409:27.92]Is that for real?
[409:32.26]so how do I prepare for how do I do I gotta prepare for this I would just wait wait I gotta be like what do I do make a joke hold on wait everyone be laughing your ass off right like I I won't like I want only luls in the chat because I'm gonna be like going over a story that was like the funniest fucking thing you've ever heard in your whole life is it happening now
[410:01.99]Let me know when it's like about to happen.
[410:12.93]Oh, it's the cat.
[410:14.85]The cat is seriously up in the tree.
[410:18.09]And I'm trying to find a way.
[410:19.78]I put on swimmies, right?
[410:22.26]To try to climb the tree better.
[410:23.54]To think maybe there's going to be grip for the swimmies.
[410:27.54]And I'm shuffling up the tree and I get up there and the cat's just like...
[410:33.07]I swear to God, this is seriously one of the most ridiculous things that ever happened in my life.
[410:38.36]The cat pukes as I get right up to the cat.
[410:42.16]I'm about to save the cat out of the tree.
[410:44.06]The cat throws up right into my face.
[410:45.68]And I'm just like, but I still had to hold on to the tree.
[410:51.36]So as I'm holding on to the tree,
[410:54.91]I almost lose grip, like twice, but thank god I had those swimmies, you know what I'm saying?
[410:57.95]Like, yellow well.
[410:59.09]So, I finally get up on the perch, right after wiping the cat puke off my face, and I go back on top, and I'm sitting.
[411:08.15]The cat has moved over to the end of the branch by now.
[411:11.24]So, by the time the cat is sitting on the end of the branch, I'm just like, don't jump off, please don't do that, like, I'm trying my hardest to save you.
[411:18.58]A bird lands on the, right in front of where the cat is.
[411:23.63]So the cat is... The cat has now got his attention on the bird.
[411:28.90]So the bird... Yes!
[411:30.84]Where is he?
[411:40.89]Did it happen yet?
[411:46.65]And it's honest to God.
[411:48.93]It was unbelievable.
[411:51.23]So you've got like...
[411:53.53]You've got, like, you've got a cat sitting on the edge.
[411:56.29]You've got a bird sitting there, and the cat now has the attention on the bird.
[411:59.71]So the bird is, the bird is, like, is squawking at the cat at this point.
[412:04.75]And then they're moving the branch back and forth.
[412:06.75]I'm, like, shaking on the branch.
[412:07.87]I'm like, holy shit.
[412:10.17]Dude, like, the branch is shaking.
[412:11.95]The cat is fucking screaming.
[412:13.81]The bird is screaming.
[412:15.25]And, like, honestly, I'm not even kidding about this.
[412:17.86]The bird just starts throwing up.
[412:20.48]And I don't know how that even happened.
[412:22.48]You know what I'm saying?
[412:23.20]It makes absolutely no sense.
[412:24.96]So, cat is on the branch.
[412:26.54]Bird now has thrown up.
[412:28.90]And I'm sitting up there with my swimmy zone trying to find a... How am I going to get both?
[412:32.06]I have to save both of these animals up here.
[412:34.12]You know what I mean?
[412:38.18]And then the fire truck, you know, like, it's flying down the road.
[412:43.40]And I'm stuck in the tree now trying to save this bird and save this cat.
[412:49.02]And the fireman has a big megaphone.
[412:51.42]Hey, can you get down from there, son?
[412:55.19]And I'm sitting like, oh, yeah, what the heck am I going to do about this?
[412:58.07]So they brought the trampoline over.
[413:03.67]I know, it's crazy.
[413:05.26]Wait, did we get a raid?
[413:07.12]Hold on, I'm in the middle of telling this crazy, crazy story that happened to me when I was like fucking 19.
[413:13.92]It's hilarious.
[413:16.56]So finally, long story short, I mean, it's been like a 35 minute story.
[413:20.61]So, I can't even tell the end of it.
[413:25.11]It's like hard to do.
[413:27.03]So, the fireman starts crawling up the tree.
[413:31.19]Because he has to climb up the tree too.
[413:33.48]By the way, Cat is already on the ground.
[413:39.02]Cat just climbed down the tree.
[413:41.80]On his own.
[413:43.34]The bird flies away, and I got this fireman that now has to help me get down from the tree.
[413:49.70]My mother came out.
[413:50.60]It was so embarrassing.
[413:51.50]It was the most fucked up thing.
[413:55.16]It was all over the place.
[413:57.26]And finally, like, the fireman said, hey, at least you tried, right?
[414:00.94]That was the last thing.
[414:02.06]At least you tried.
[414:04.16]Oh, my God, my stomach fucking hurts.
[414:12.26]Isn't that, like, insane, though?
[414:16.09]But, uh, thank you, Joel.
[414:17.95]Joel came in with a raid right there.
[414:20.92]Thank you so much.
[414:23.18]I hope you guys had fun.
[414:24.22]We're playing this... We're playing this game called Item's Tale.
[414:28.15]A shop of... A little shop of horrors.
[414:30.11]I don't even know what the title of the name of the game is.
[414:33.01]Receipt here.
[414:36.93]So... It's a... You buy stuff.
[414:39.05]You sell stuff.
[414:39.71]You trade stuff.
[414:40.29]You fight monsters.
[414:41.05]It's pretty awesome.
[414:44.70]But... Welcome, everybody.
[414:46.26]Thank you, Joel.
[414:48.38]Hope you had a good stream.
[414:49.14]Welcome.
[414:50.48]Welcome.
[414:53.10]But, after that, let's start a, uh, let's sell some stuff.
[414:57.90]Sorry for, like, a long-winded, like, 40-minute story.
[415:02.41]But it was, it was the funniest thing I've probably ever said.
[415:06.29]All, like, in my life.
[415:09.17]Ooh!
[415:10.29]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[415:15.28]Can you repeat the story?
[415:16.34]No, I can't.
[415:17.02]It's just, it'll take too long.
[415:21.83]I don't wanna buy this for $10,000.
[415:23.25]But I'm gonna try.
[415:32.79]I wanna sell this.
[415:33.73]No.
[415:35.87]I'll give you 500 bucks for it.
[415:45.24]That was so funny, I threw up on my bird.
[415:51.87]There we are, alright.
[415:55.14]Whistle, over- overcharge.
[415:57.00]250%.
[415:57.44]Thank you!
[415:57.72]Wait, what?
[415:57.94]What happened?
[416:20.09]I literally come in.
[416:22.01]I literally come in and you're saying the bird shit and vomited.
[416:24.54]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[416:25.88]That was a long story.
[416:30.12]It was a very long story there.
[416:31.28]I was talking about some crazy thing that happened when I was like a teenager.
[416:36.76]You want a treasure, okay.
[416:39.93]Hey, remember how everybody made fun of me for doing this?
[416:42.49]Remember when everyone talked all the smack in the chat about how I shouldn't have paid like $10,000, $12,000 for this?
[416:51.69]What do you say now?
[416:57.45]Where are they?
[416:58.01]Where are they now?
[416:58.53]Where are they?
[417:06.44]I just made a shitload of money.
[417:12.94]We all said it was a good idea.
[417:14.16]No, you didn't.
[417:15.10]At least ten of you said it was a bad idea.
[417:18.67]I'm on an errand today.
[417:19.53]Yes, you are.
[417:23.32]185.
[417:23.40]I already bought something from the vending machine.
[417:36.09]Brought you something good.
[417:36.85]I mean, that's not that good.
[417:40.45]That's like... That's like 45% of base price good.
[417:46.06]Almost level 16.
[417:46.66]What can I do with 16?
[417:52.81]Need to get some sweets really quickly.

[418:23.15]Can we stop laughing now?
[418:26.48]Um, yeah.
[418:27.82]Nothing funny is going on right now.
[418:29.20]You can stop.
[418:30.34]You can stop doing that.
[418:31.50]Because nothing funny is currently happening right now.
[418:36.46]You can cease doing what you're doing.
[418:40.02]You don't have to do that now.
[418:42.65]Are we clear on that?
[418:44.59]You know what I mean?
[418:48.41]You get it?
[418:48.87]You know what I'm saying?

[425:40.34]Alright, this is better than what you have.
[425:42.58]I don't know your price gauge here.

[426:46.82]Didn't we already just go over this?
[426:49.56]You just said, you said a thing that had some type of connection to food.
[426:54.29]And now I'm hungry.
[426:55.09]Why'd you do that?
[426:55.61]Okay.
[427:05.19]I want a Krabby Patty, though.
[427:06.97]Even if it's, like, from the bottom of the ocean, I would still eat it.
[427:08.73]Alright, that's fine.
[427:17.58]Fill this back up.
[427:23.36]Powerful Anti-Venom.
[427:25.25]+2...
[427:29.16]Alright.
[427:30.57]I'm gonna hold on to the ones that are plus four.
[427:32.61]I'm gonna keep a couple of these.
[427:33.53]I feel like I'm gonna need them.
[427:39.63]Uh-oh, that was an angry voice.
[427:47.16]What's up, Alouette?
[427:47.92]Why are you so upset?
[427:49.78]You liar!
[427:51.02]That stupid walnut bread fisherman story was a lie!
[427:56.06]What?
[427:56.30]No, it isn't.
[427:56.76]The walnut bread fisherman wakes up early in the morning to risk his life on the open sea so that he can fish up walnut bread for everyone.
[428:04.76]It's the coolest thing ever.
[428:07.80]Oh, thanks to your stupid story, I made a fool of myself.
[428:11.12]Why do I put up with this sort of treatment?
[428:17.07]They're both real stupid.
[428:19.59]It's your own fault for believing something so silly.
[428:24.83]If you think bread comes from the bread fisherman... You probably need to go back to the second grade.
[428:35.61]I don't know, you may... Hold on, the thing is though... They may be in the second grade.
[428:40.17]So they don't even know that... Okay, I got it.
[428:42.75]Yeah.
[428:43.57]You don't know where bread comes from when you're like nine.
[428:48.57]It just magically appears on the table.
[428:51.71]So, no, this makes sense.
[428:53.14]I'm wrong.
[428:56.45]Papa told me that story.
[428:57.69]Yeah, right.
[429:00.05]The stork brings the bread.
[429:01.77]Yeah.
[429:05.45]I had no... come to think of it.
[429:08.15]I'm trying to think of where I thought food came from when I was 10, 11 years old.
[429:13.95]Bread and nuts and berries and shit.
[429:16.73]I don't... I knew somebody made it.
[429:23.84]But I didn't really know how.
[429:28.78]Ooh, I can get this for a good price.
[429:37.76]49%.
[429:37.82]Nice.
[429:43.87]Do you know where plants came from?
[429:45.09]Yeah, I mean, of course.
[429:50.11]Buy this book.
[429:51.61]You give me some pretty good stuff here.

[430:47.95]Alright. 1850.
[431:08.61]Oh, I'll take a ham sandwich, please.
[431:10.83]That dude has no money.
[431:24.68]More ham sandwiches.
[431:29.27]I need something for my experiments.
[431:30.53]218.
[431:35.35]Near perfect.
[431:42.92]I want to get two books, and I want them in three days.
[431:44.80]I have books.
[431:46.60]I just... I have them ready to go.
[431:50.56]Why is Chat surprised that Elan can read?
[431:52.44]Yeah.
[431:55.98]Sweets are increasing in popularity with home makers.
[431:59.90]Prices for powerful anti-venoms are falling rapidly.
[432:02.88]Get them out of here.
[432:10.74]What am I getting?
[432:11.22]Toothpicks?
[432:11.80]What

[432:53.23]Sweets are already up.
[432:55.69]What day do I have?
[432:56.17]I got one more day.
[432:57.47]Tomorrow's the day that it's an $80,000 payment.
[432:58.97]Let me check something here, hold on.
[433:08.76]Dark and gaudy.
[433:12.33]Vending machines.
[433:13.49]At this level, if you are defeated in a dungeon, you may bring back two items.
[433:18.92]Level 17 is item storage.
[433:20.72]Okay, kind of just dungeon crawling stuff.
[433:31.74]I'm just trying to stockpile money and then we can do dungeon runs for like a few days.
[433:37.48]There it is. 7500.
[433:48.80]What's going on?
[433:50.16]Why are you guys doing this?
[433:56.03]What's with the market?
[433:57.31]What's manipulating the market here?
[434:03.47]Check this out.
[434:03.89]We're fine.
[434:04.45]Buy it.
[434:05.99]I don't want it, but I'll do this.
[434:06.98]Really?
[434:16.53]The score is too high.
[434:17.51]That doesn't... Look, just because the score is high does not mean you have to bring the score down.
[434:22.79]That's not how that works.
[434:39.62]I'm not gonna buy it.
[434:42.50]I'll buy it for 1900.
[434:43.54]Keep the combo going.
[434:52.81]My little lady, how much for this?
[434:54.47]For you, 3500 bucks.
[435:06.18]I got enough padding to keep me going.
[435:09.60]Could I sell it?
[435:10.20]I'll take it like that.
[435:15.81]That's my best offer.
[435:20.91]Elliot wave patterns.
[435:22.39]I'm surprised somebody here knows that that is.
[435:30.26]Ooh.
[435:34.30]That's an expensive hat.
[435:41.38]Jerma thinks we're stupid.
[435:43.47]No, I don't.
[435:44.01]I just... I don't... Why would somebody here know what an Elliot wave... Okay, what is it?
[435:49.35]What's an Elliot wave pattern?
[435:55.48]Explain it to me.
[436:07.09]No, that does not mean go to Google and get the Wikipedia blog about it.
[436:12.73]I want you to tell me what it is.
[436:14.27]I want you to chart something for me.
[436:15.81]Alright, what have I got?
[436:20.76]Tomorrow's the day.
[436:22.20]I've got one more time in the shop here.
[436:26.31]Let's get the mermaid shoes up there.
[436:28.94]Golden pedestal up there.
[436:37.02]What an economy nerd.
[436:42.32]You don't know what you're talking about, okay?
[436:54.48]We're a candy apple store now, guys.
[436:58.30]How's it look over here?
[436:59.44]Well, people are buying these.

[437:14.58]Scrap plate.
[437:15.40]Scrap plate.
[437:16.87]Armband.
[437:17.37]That's fine.
[437:20.81]He finally checked the second vending machine.
[437:25.86]There's only one vending machine.
[437:32.82]Huh?
[437:34.26]Put in the blue ones?
[437:35.04]I will next time.
[437:40.61]How much will I take for the... I'll give you 66% for it.

[437:47.91]I need to start the combo.
[438:04.66]Ooh, alright.
[438:05.73]206.
[438:05.75]3300.
[438:08.73]I have so much padding.
[438:15.37]Don't you think some wonderful art like this would make life better?
[438:20.47]I'm gonna accidentally hit... I'm gonna be talking to you guys or something.
[438:23.42]I'm gonna accidentally just fuck this whole thing up.
[438:26.48]What is it?
[438:27.06]Ocean wallpaper?
[438:29.42]I'll give you 10 grand for it.
[438:33.66]I wanted the ocean.
[438:34.40]I'm gonna go get the ocean wallpaper.
[438:35.56]I want it.
[438:38.68]I'll take the ham sandwich.
[438:39.62]226.
[438:39.64]Yeah.
[438:41.30]What's going on here?
[438:43.22]Hello?
[439:03.93]Again?
[439:04.33]What just fucking happened?
[439:06.29]What was that?
[439:29.22]Save game.
[439:30.19]Now, hurry up.
[439:31.67]Before that happens again.
[439:32.61]I don't know what just happened.
[439:38.09]I just hit every button and it fixed itself.
[439:43.05]Price of armor has increased.
[439:44.19]I got a lot of it.
[439:45.69]Price of food has normalized.
[439:46.87]Alright, well, I still have a lot.
[439:52.00]Good.
[439:57.78]What's with the camera?
[440:04.75]Oh, okay.
[440:05.13]Alright, food is normalized.
[440:09.82]Armor is now worth a lot.
[440:12.78]I got wizard robes.
[440:16.00]I've got... That's not worth more?
[440:19.82]That's armor.
[440:23.27]How's that not armor?
[440:24.33]It literally says armor.
[440:28.61]Keep the shoes up there.
[440:43.08]So you guys are saying that, put the blue shit in here.
[440:46.57]But I know I can sell this stuff.
[440:48.29]Normally.
[440:59.77]It's base price only.
[441:07.29]Bat wings in.
[441:08.13]I don't think I can do it.
[441:12.43]No, I gotta keep some bat wings.
[441:14.70]So put the charms in here and just... Guaranteed?
[441:16.94]What is this doing in here?
[441:27.37]Bat wings?
[441:27.79]Alright, looks good.
[441:36.76]Alright, I wanted to do something very specific today.
[441:38.65]Today's the day that I just keep selling.
[441:40.51]I got plenty of inventory.
[441:43.81]No, I wanted to... No.
[441:46.31]Hold on.
[441:47.51]I specifically wanted to get the ocean wall.
[441:56.07]It's not even here.
[442:08.12]She was trying to scam me.
[442:09.07]Yeah, but I want the ocean wall.
[442:39.36]I'm fine.
[442:41.09]A little bit sad.
[442:42.03]Working hard, I hope.
[442:44.65]Are you out on a walk, sir?
[442:46.31]That I am.
[442:47.05]I make a habit of getting out of the house on days like this.
[442:49.33]Walking in the sun like this is good for this.
[442:50.93]We've already seen this.
[442:59.77]Alright.
[443:01.23]I think this is good.
[443:02.33]I need some... What have I got for orders?
[443:08.93]Today, two weapons.
[443:10.57]Do I have two weapons?
[443:17.33]I don't think I do.
[443:18.01]I have two spears.
[443:22.62]I gotta go buy them.
[443:30.30]Ooh, and they're cheap as shit, too.
[443:38.19]Perfume staff.
[443:39.03]Yeah, I'll take one.
[443:39.53]Hurricane bolt.
[443:39.87]Gimme it. Gimme it. Gimme it. Gimme it.
[443:48.77]Okay.
[444:00.87]Stop buying.
[444:03.29]I'm fine!
[444:03.47]You need to buy!
[444:03.95]I have to buy to be able to afford things.
[444:07.52]What do you mean, don't buy?
[444:10.67]The price is up on this.
[444:11.47]I think I'm going to make it.
[444:21.34]Rank 1 helm.
[444:22.14]Ooh!
[444:23.86]This is what I wanted.
[444:24.50]Remember, I bought the Thankful Statue.
[444:25.96]Okay, I'm going to make this.
[444:32.39]Worth it.
[444:37.46]And the price is up on this, I'm gonna make this too.
[444:39.16]Alright, finally get to have a nice big lunch for once.
[444:57.05]Time to dig in.
[444:57.95]The dog eats his food.
[445:03.88]Oh, this place is dull as a rock today.
[445:07.27]Oh, Caillou, hello.
[445:09.41]What the, you again?
[445:10.61]They aren't giving out candy today, you know.
[445:13.11]Come on, I'm totally too old to come in here fishing for candy.
[445:15.75]Which kind of makes me sad.
[445:17.19]But that's not the point.
[445:18.79]Oh, that reminds me.
[445:19.47]Yesterday, Kunerp in the market was handing out those signature mud pies the store makes to anyone who wanted one.
[445:26.53]Heaven, those are great.
[445:29.43]What?
[445:30.55]Why didn't you come get me then?
[445:31.93]Now I want one too.
[445:33.61]You're about as predictable as a mud pie too.
[445:39.93]Out of here.
[445:40.93]Stop selling.
[445:43.15]It's all about the money.
[445:44.02]It's all about the money.
[445:44.90]It's all about the money.
[445:50.02]I'm the guy who ordered the weapons.
[445:51.08]Yes, you are.
[445:56.70]This is a weapon, right?
[446:00.58]I could do the perfume staff in the hurricane book.
[446:10.24]20,000.
[446:10.26]Bingo.
[446:12.96]Get that staff for Caillou.
[446:27.31]I don't even want to play with Caillou right now.
[446:30.01]Ooh.
[446:34.17]I'll be 115%. 11,300.
[446:42.35]How can he still be playing this game?
[446:43.63]Because I am painfully addicted to it.
[446:45.75]Came by to sell this book.
[446:51.79]I'll buy it for 800 bucks.
[447:00.26]Hi, you.
[447:00.72]Ooh.
[447:04.52]That's much better than your raincoat.
[447:05.88]5,000?
[447:05.90]5,000.
[447:07.74]No.
[447:12.67]4700.
[447:13.07]Rich girl.
[447:27.99]Here's some red.
[447:29.21]I don't want to ruin my... I don't want to ruin the combo.
[447:35.21]I have a good combo going.
[447:37.79]Just give it to me.
[447:39.01]Ooh.
[447:45.05]Wizard's Robe.
[447:45.71]I'm gonna be... Yeah, let's do 16,000.
[447:50.87]Nice.
[447:51.27]2 AM Eastern?
[447:59.69]I know, it's getting late.
[448:00.71]It is.
[448:01.49]We're almost at that point where... Yeah, but I gotta keep... I gotta play this game again.
[448:08.68]No, but hold on.
[448:26.05]Ooh!
[448:28.47]I'll buy it.
[448:28.89]Can I get away with like 49%?
[448:36.80]Level 17.
[448:37.36]There's also endless hell mode with high interest debt.
[448:45.70]That's hilarious.
[448:49.40]80,000 today, and then the $200,000 payment, and we see where we are.
[448:58.11]I got two of these golden scales.
[448:59.47]Let's put them up.
[449:04.37]They're worth a shitload.
[449:07.89]Meditation ring.
[449:08.90]Alright, let's do one more.
[449:09.74]One more, uh, cell.
[449:11.94]These are fine.
[449:12.64]Let's go.
[449:16.14]Okay.
[449:23.84]I'll give you $124.
[449:24.40]I got this from my neighbor's husband.
[449:37.00]I have no interest in it.
[449:38.18]I'll take it.
[449:38.56]42%.
[449:40.36]Take it or leave it.
[449:41.08]45%.
[449:41.24]Get out of here.
[449:57.87]East Coast is full of milk drinkers with an 8 p.m.
[450:00.68]bedtime.
[450:01.38]What?
[450:05.34]I need a weapon.
[450:06.16]I don't want to give... Okay, I'm going to give you a crappy one.
[450:11.93]Hey, I'm originally from the East Coast.
[450:16.45]Come on, really?
[450:17.55]Just take it off me!
[450:21.85]I'm not an 8 p.m.
[450:22.81]milk drinker.
[450:23.42]Shh.
[450:35.17]Don't worry.
[450:36.29]I'm going to get to the end of this game.
[450:39.91]Oh, boy.
[450:44.47]Let's be conservative here.
[450:45.43]112. 112.
[451:00.95]It's not metal.
[451:04.85]Metal.
[451:05.13]What do I got that's metal?
[451:06.94]The game doesn't like when you actually pick metals.
[451:09.48]What is actually made out of metal?
[451:15.48]You think I drink skim milk?
[451:16.98]What's... no.
[451:21.82]There's no silver or gold.
[451:23.16]Okay.
[451:26.34]Nothing here.
[451:26.82]Iron armor.
[451:29.57]Yeah, that'll do.
[451:30.19]Alright.
[451:37.39]I don't even, I don't drink milk.
[451:42.74]Ooh.
[451:44.80]Oh, ooh.
[451:48.38]Doing a whole lot of oohs.
[451:59.90]I want this ocean wallpaper really bad.
[452:04.58]I'll give you 30 grand for it.
[452:06.52]The debt has been paid.
[452:12.73]Coming up next is 200,000.
[452:28.06]Which means I need to be at 400,000.
[452:33.29]We're getting... We're getting to the end game here.
[452:36.09]The end game's coming up.
[452:36.87]It has to be.
[452:37.95]I'm going to save it.
[452:40.81]And we're going to power through this.
[452:42.98]I only got one week.
[452:53.38]Weapons has decreased.
[452:54.36]Get them off.
[452:56.16]The sweets boom has ended, or everything is normalizing here.
[452:58.36]The price of bat wings has normalized, or... Right, right, right.
[453:00.64]Get that up there.
[453:07.30]Knight's helm, that thing's awesome.
[453:14.13]Get it up there.
[453:16.59]Cloth hat up there.
[453:17.69]Cloth.
[453:18.55]Hamburger.
[453:19.33]Peach.
[453:23.37]No one's buying these.
[453:23.99]Let's give it one more day.
[453:27.96]Alright, we got $200,000 coming up here.
[453:30.34]I have enough.
[453:32.20]But... We are at the end game.
[453:35.84]I'm ready.
[453:41.66]I'm just gonna start the... Let's go.
[453:44.06]Sell.
[453:49.16]Mommy asked me to sell this.
[454:02.88]Will you sell this to me, girl?
[454:04.56]I will.
[454:06.18]You're such a kind old man here.
[454:07.93]These sell pretty well.
[454:24.45]Make a million or you're not a gamer.
[454:25.90]Get out of here with that.
[454:32.88]2700 for a bowl of soup.
[454:35.18]What's that?
[454:48.85]I want the cat statue.
[454:54.45]How much does she want for that?
[454:58.13]I want that.
[455:14.40]I was going for it.
[455:15.32]I was going to pay 50-something percent over the premium.
[455:17.74]What?
[455:21.88]There we go.
[455:23.19]He needs this.
[455:29.04]10-8.
[455:32.40]Now he has that for armor.
[455:33.36]Good.
[455:36.76]She wants 200% minimum.
[455:39.56]She ain't gonna get that.
[455:41.82]No one is buying this stuff in here.
[455:45.89]Come here.
[455:48.61]Gaudy and dark.
[455:51.23]Item storage.
[455:51.77]At this level, your overall inventory capacity in a dungeon is increased by 25 items.
[455:54.53]To 225 items.
[455:55.03]Level 18 is more items.
[456:01.88]Um, how on Earth do they expect you to get to level 50?
[456:06.80]That's kind of insane.
[456:18.99]Alright.
[456:23.55]Let's get this crap out of here.
[456:24.79]Put the bracelet up there.
[456:28.58]That looks alright.
[456:32.09]I'll get that chest piece on there too.
[456:37.41]Alright.
[456:40.23]We're open.
[456:46.36]There it is.
[456:46.98]207.
[456:47.00]You're pretty stingy.
[456:56.94]I need 600k.
[456:58.62]Can I get a book?
[457:00.43]You can get a book.
[457:02.61]I've got at least a few of them.
[457:13.42]Good night, streamer boy.
[457:14.22]Good night, chat.
[457:15.52]Have a great night.
[457:16.24]If you gotta go, you gotta go.
[457:19.30]I am gonna try to get through to the end of the debt.
[457:23.14]More than how long that takes.
[457:24.20]There we go.
[457:24.78]Here it is.
[457:31.12]125,000.
[457:31.14]Is it really?
[457:31.64]Nice.
[457:33.28]This.
[457:33.52]My combo.
[458:03.45]What's a good price?
[458:04.19]600.
[458:11.63]Day 24.
[458:11.87]He's still playing the damn game.
[458:14.40]I haven't slept in weeks.
[458:15.54]God help us.
[458:19.80]Thankfully, this... Now, I am going to do something here that might be considered stupid.
[458:25.17]But I'm going to try to get $50,000 from her. $50,000.
[458:38.43]That's still worth it.
[458:39.93]That was fucking almost 40 grand.
[458:47.13]Two treasures in two days.
[458:48.39]I can do that.
[458:55.90]Is that the only order that I have?
[459:02.06]Tomorrow, two weapons and two books.
[459:05.76]I got weapons, right?
[459:08.98]Yeah, I got weapons, I got books.
[459:13.90]Yeah, oh yeah.
[459:15.78]Oh yeah.
[459:26.18]Ah, okay, right.
[459:28.78]We're good.
[459:30.02]Silk clothes, yeah.
[459:30.70]I'm killing it right now.
[459:37.85]Nobody can stop me right now.
[459:42.31]Somebody bought it.
[459:43.91]Somebody did buy it.
[459:44.96]Okay, put like a candy in here, whatever.
[459:56.88]Okay.
[460:06.47]At this stage in the game, you're really going to come in here and try to sell me this.
[460:10.13]I'm only doing that for the combo.
[460:12.88]Change the decor.
[460:13.74]Change the decor.
[460:15.62]That's money I don't want to spend right now.
[460:26.05]Changing the floor means I have to spend like 40 grand.
[460:30.55]Fix your floors and walls, you fuck.
[460:35.58]You want me to... I'm going to lose the game if I spend like $50,000 right now.
[460:40.38]This is Legend of Zelda decor.
[460:47.35]Don't you guys love The Legend of Zelda?
[460:50.27]Buying the silk.
[460:57.38]Thank you.
[460:58.28]It's sold.
[461:07.22]Need something metal.
[461:09.72]I've got something metal for you.
[461:18.43]Keep that combo going.
[461:27.33]Ooh, good.
[461:32.82]400.
[461:33.76]I've made it to double what I have.
[461:41.48]Leather gloves are currently in.
[461:42.90]Probably some metal things has normalized, right?
[461:47.58]Ooh, wait a minute.
[461:50.33]This is up.
[461:52.51]These are really in.
[461:59.03]No one's buying this stuff.
[462:05.61]How about this?
[462:07.01]Not bad.
[462:16.04]Sell a fucking apple or something, whatever.
[462:19.69]Alright, I'll change the decor.
[462:20.93]I'll do it.
[462:21.37]Alright, change the flooring.
[462:24.33]Planks.
[462:26.85]Tile.
[462:27.23]We'll do plank.
[462:30.15]Change the walls.
[462:30.79]Let's do... We'll do the resort wallpaper.
[462:33.19]Or the lacquer.
[462:35.47]Resort wallpaper.
[462:37.11]See?
[462:42.37]Now we're light and gaudy.
[462:45.87]Actually, I do like the other one better.
[462:49.55]That looks cool.
[462:57.20]Nice.
[463:00.14]Parade helm.
[463:03.82]He'll bite.
[463:10.54]Beanbag Sonic wallpaper.
[463:13.98]You're really into the parade stuff, huh?
[463:16.72]That means you'll buy it at a 221% offer.
[463:25.33]How's a beanbag Sonic?
[463:28.79]Mine's selling this.
[463:29.95]Here you go, 175, because I know you're broke.
[463:32.97]Thank you very much.
[463:35.35]It's sold.
[463:36.37]Welcome.
[463:38.55]I'm not interested.
[463:40.03]How much do you want?
[463:48.76]in the combo what would you do if there was another payment after no she didn't have that if there's another payment after 200 I expect there to be another payment after 200. that's why I want to make sure I have like 500 grand
[464:24.20]Don't have a gaudy, tacky store.
[464:30.54]Well, I'll move it over to the other side.
[464:42.51]Price of heavy armor has decreased.
[464:45.34]I don't think I have any of it out.
[464:46.90]Eh.
[464:48.76]All armor has normalized.
[464:50.50]Weapons are still shitty.
[464:57.06]What do we have for days here?
[464:58.02]Okay, I got a few days.
[464:58.78]Wasn't somebody coming in today?
[465:08.58]I can't go adventuring, can I?
[465:12.54]Today.
[465:13.48]Two weapons and two books.
[465:20.08]I can't go adventuring today.
[465:25.57]What can I buy?

[465:41.04]Silver Gauntlets.
[465:43.40]Silk Clothes.
[465:44.54]No, they're not cheap.
[465:46.62]I only buy it when it's cheap.
[465:58.47]Okay, what about over here?
[465:59.33]Anything cheap over here?
[466:03.82]No, rings don't sell.
[466:11.01]Nope.
[466:11.89]I got my... I got my stock.
[466:16.21]Fill your store with gloves.
[466:17.36]I did this already.
[466:27.21]Alright, so.
[466:32.25]I might as well put some stuff in here.
[466:33.77]5,000 for the strong arm band, and let's... iron.
[466:40.31]Get the necklace up there too.
[466:49.31]Let's go!
[466:55.26]Oh, hey, Elon.
[466:56.86]Stopped by today to give you one of these.
[466:59.16]Goddess card.
[467:03.83]Strictly speaking, I'm a guild member.
[467:05.29]What does this guy use for a weapon?
[467:08.93]Haven't been in a whole lot of dungeons, but when I met you, I got to thinking, hey, I need to start working, too.
[467:14.33]You're embarrassing me a little.
[467:17.51]Anyway, be sure and give me a chance.
[467:19.09]I'll go with you anytime you want.
[467:21.65]Counting on you.
[467:23.73]Hell yeah!
[467:25.88]We will never be using you.
[467:37.38]He uses his bare hands.
[467:39.67]Interesting.
[467:43.11]Do I have the weapons?
[467:43.93]I do have the weapons.
[467:49.53]But... Yeah, I'm gonna... They're cheap.
[467:55.56]I gotta sell these cheaper.
[467:56.96]Unfortunately, everyone's gonna say, no, what are you doing, don't, stop, stop, stop.
[468:04.23]But I have, I mean, I have to.
[468:09.37]See, told you.
[468:18.17]I got screwed on that order.
[468:27.81]We got... We can just take the 200 warriors twice.
[468:35.94]Perfect.
[468:38.62]Can you sell something for nothing?
[468:39.74]I think the... One dollar.
[468:43.00]Here she is.
[468:45.23]Heretical carpet!
[468:48.23]Dude.
[468:49.65]I can get the scary carpet too?
[468:52.71]What does she want?
[468:57.05]No, dude.
[468:59.09]No, that'll ruin the whole playthrough.
[469:04.23]I'm sorry, I'm not gonna do it.
[469:13.10]Too close.
[469:13.72]Can I pick him up in three days?
[469:15.04]Yes.
[469:15.94]I'm so close.
[469:29.72]I should have bought the carpet.
[469:33.02]Maybe.
[469:37.96]I'd like a treasure.
[469:38.82]I got plenty of those and they're very expensive.
[469:44.34]This one is $14,900.
[469:44.94]It is worth $117,500.
[470:08.23]I could probably get away with five five five five food I got food ham sandwich I still have I got one more I got one more you're in luck
[470:37.73]Remember, fellow chat boys, sleep is important.
[470:40.23]That goes for you too, Jeremy.
[470:44.83]I know.
[470:45.13]But I'm almost level 18.
[470:50.07]I'm so close.
[470:56.51]Look.
[470:56.65]I have 1, 2, 3, 4 days for 200,000 and then...
[471:07.97]Why are there 36 days in this month?
[471:12.13]What month is this?
[471:22.52]That's not a real month.
[471:24.60]It's a pretend month.
[471:25.48]Okay.
[471:25.76]I did my orders.
[471:31.57]Outstanding orders.
[471:32.19]We don't have any.
[471:32.83]We have tomorrow.
[471:33.79]We have two treasures.
[471:37.06]So I have... I'm going to go buy two extraordinarily expensive treasures.
[471:50.44]Golden pedestal, and I already have a thankful statue, so that's fine.
[472:00.15]Metal items has increased.
[472:01.49]Good.
[472:03.23]Weapons has normalized.
[472:05.91]Ooh, look at these knight's blades.
[472:08.53]Put me over the edge.
[472:09.91]Oh, put me over the edge.
[472:10.87]This is why I was holding for so long, don't you know?
[472:13.09]This is what I was doing this for.
[472:17.32]I've been saving it for so long for this purpose.
[472:20.00]Move.

[473:47.03]Warrior's Helm?
[473:49.76]225 is safe.
[473:53.08]Yeah, you store it to light and plain, so the scammed lady doesn't come in anymore.
[474:05.55]Close.
[474:08.25]Um... I mean, here, you can have a Windbreaker.

[474:42.22]I'm doing so well.
[474:43.50]This would be so sad if I couldn't get to the next level after this.
[474:47.12]Look at this shit.
[474:50.33]I'm dumping huge money here.
[474:52.27]212.

[475:00.09]Thank you for your hard work today.
[475:14.22]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[475:16.74]Keep them up.
[475:17.58]Price of long swords has decreased.
[475:18.92]That doesn't matter.
[475:19.46]Leather gloves boom has ended.
[475:21.52]People with tabs should... Alright, so it's still... Oh, come on.
[475:27.60]What should I put?

[476:55.29]Checkered floor.
[476:56.05]140 grand.
[476:56.47]No, that's too much.
[477:02.83]That's too much.
[477:03.56]I can't.
[477:05.62]Super Vend?
[477:09.62]This is too much money.
[477:15.63]Now, I'm thinking about getting the book.
[477:23.90]It's an investment, it's an investment.
[477:36.94]Fucking crystal sword.

[478:16.61]There she is!
[478:17.05]There she is!
[478:17.45]Missed receipt!
[478:21.61]Thank me for what?
[478:23.73]Oh, yeah.
[478:24.32]I remember this.
[478:24.82]I already did it.
[478:25.48]Alright, let's make it happen.
[478:31.82]Come on in.
[478:33.98]Welcome!
[478:40.81]Dumbass apple.
[478:46.56]There it is.
[478:55.48]And this, and he's, it's the grandpa, so I'm thinking two, I'm thinking twenty... twenty-seven thousand.
[479:08.97]Good.
[479:11.63]Good.
[479:16.74]When my grandmother died, she told me to sell this piece of chocolate.
[479:21.78]Okay.
[479:22.40]Who's next?
[479:30.94]I'd like you to buy this.
[479:32.84]This gross bread.
[479:37.84]Dude's eyes.
[479:38.84]Fuck.
[479:44.46]I do have the treasures that you were looking for.
[479:46.32]I've got the golden pedestal, and I also have... the... you know what, let's just get rid of this damn thing. 26,000.
[480:12.42]High as fuck.
[480:14.46]Oh.
[480:16.16]Oh.
[480:17.30]Steal breastplate.
[480:19.00]Double it up.
[480:20.76]197.
[480:20.86]She's stingy.
[480:21.40]That's true.
[480:21.86]Yeah, that's true.
[480:27.94]I don't know why.
[480:42.58]I do have a cloth hat.
[480:43.80]You're lucky.
[480:56.53]My dying wish is for you to make 30 yams with me.
[481:06.03]Use me and the recipe and I want you to sell it to people.
[481:29.35]Oh, everyone's buying all the expensive stuff.
[481:31.15]I love it.
[481:32.01]I love it.
[481:32.55]We'll go 230.
[481:32.99]225.
[481:33.05]That was almost all expensive items.
[481:46.76]Well, it's a sunshine forecast.
[481:47.84]Beware of sunstroke.
[481:49.74]Price of armor has normalized.
[481:51.28]Except this is still... This is still catching some money.
[481:58.16]I'm gonna move this stuff up here.
[482:08.14]Pure edge will sell for a lot.
[482:18.93]Silver armor.
[482:20.25]Hmm.
[482:21.79]No, it'll be worth a lot more.
[482:23.51]Does it- I mean, I could- No.
[482:25.48]I'll hold on to it.
[482:29.58]I can't wait till once swords increase.
[482:31.58]I could probably get $100,000 for this.
[482:32.48]Are these out?
[482:57.14]Let me just slow down here and talk About uh, no, no, no, no, that's alright.
[483:11.88]Let's go
[483:19.76]Bingo.
[483:23.78]First time out the door.
[483:31.58]I'll take the sandwich.
[483:33.20]I'll give you a good premium on it too, 50%.
[483:34.54]Imagine playing this for eight hours.
[483:43.60]Well, not gonna be playing it for that much longer.
[483:50.55]I just need to pay off my debt, and then... And then guess what?
[483:55.46]And then just... I was talking to Kim last night about this.
[484:00.18]I was like, honey, this game's a lot of fun.
[484:03.30]We should play this game together and sell stuff.
[484:05.64]So after I pay off my debt, maybe we won't see it again.
[484:08.48]Maybe me and Kim will just play it.
[484:09.60]Thank you very much.
[484:20.66]I talked this game up like crazy to Kim.
[484:35.17]How would playing together work?
[484:37.42]Well, she would have the controller, and I would sit behind, going, oh, look at that!
[484:44.23]Big price increase, big price increase!
[484:45.83]And she'd go, big price increase!
[484:47.35]And she'd pay and I'd go, I'd have my fingers in my mouth like, oh fuck!
[484:59.40]No, it's not, guys, I wouldn't be backseating her.
[485:03.48]I would be riding the ride with her.
[485:08.28]Okay?
[485:09.60]There's a difference.
[485:10.44]Riding the ride means whatever happens.
[485:13.04]It's just... She's gonna play and I'm gonna react.
[485:17.79]I'm just in the car.
[485:18.67]I mean, I'm front... Okay, I'm front seating her.
[485:21.57]Because I'm in the car, but I'm not back seating.
[485:25.19]I'm front seating.
[485:28.17]I'm just reacting.
[485:29.67]Yeah, this is a reaction.
[485:30.77]That out there.
[485:36.38]Anyone deliveries?
[485:42.20]Tomorrow, two cold weather clothes.
[485:44.14]I think I got that, right?
[485:50.22]Windbreaker cloth robe?
[485:52.02]Wait for adventuring.
[485:54.14]No, I don't have any.
[485:55.00]No, I gotta go buy this shit right now.
[485:56.28]It's too late.
[485:57.12]I gotta do it tomorrow morning.
[486:14.04]Welcome to Twitch.
[486:15.53]I've been looking for something warm.
[486:19.75]Uh-oh.

[486:31.44]No.
[486:32.60]No.
[486:34.32]I don't got it.

[486:38.26]Warrior's helm?
[486:41.67]Get lost.
[486:50.63]And sandwich!
[486:51.21]Look at that money.
[486:53.23]2300 is always a good price for that thing.
[486:59.23]Nice.
[487:24.59]Perfect.
[487:25.47]You want the iron armor?
[487:26.35]I'll give it to you for $4,000.
[487:27.19]Level 19.
[487:27.45]What do I get?
[487:30.31]I think I can sell it.
[487:40.30]Is this your grandfather?
[487:42.00]Did he say that?
[487:57.06]That was a good day.
[487:57.62]I'm gonna do this.
[487:59.62]Daggers has increased.
[488:08.47]Look at that.
[488:09.19]Pure Edge.
[488:13.57]I'm out of daggers.
[488:19.69]Swords are way down, though.
[488:20.61]Let's get this ring up here and...
[488:28.16]Today's the day.
[488:28.66]I need to get some warm clothes, right?
[488:31.34]Two warm clothes.
[488:32.10]And anything else?
[488:39.57]Two clothes or two cold weather clothes.
[488:41.81]Alright, so let's buy some warm clothes.
[488:49.27]Scarves.
[488:59.79]Does he sell this?
[489:07.12]Battle sweater.
[489:13.15]Did I get a battle sweater?
[489:17.47]Fur robe?
[489:18.75]Ooh!
[489:19.80]Extra warmth and style.
[489:33.94]I can only get one of them.
[489:35.22]Will the Battle Sweater work?
[489:47.09]Probably not.
[489:48.21]Wizard's Robe?
[489:49.39]Thick Robe?
[489:49.95]Cloth Robe?
[490:03.29]What about helmets?
[490:06.21]Warm hat?
[490:08.49]Alright, that's the two warm clothes.
[490:10.35]And then we just need regular clothes.
[490:12.55]For Grandpa.
[490:15.49]I'm gonna give Grandpa a battle sweater and silk.
[490:29.60]I think I'm ready.
[490:34.94]I want a weapon.
[490:35.84]Ooh, do you?
[490:38.24]You're gonna pay a premium.
[490:49.36]Battle swear, Grandpa!
[490:50.92]Activate!
[490:53.32]Ooh.
[490:54.67]Very cool.
[491:00.88]Why do I press the button to have rockets come out of my chest?
[491:07.41]That would be like part of the comedy in the movie when he presses the button for the rockets to come out.
[491:11.47]And the rocket- he has the sweater on backwards.
[491:15.22]And it shoots him backwards and he flies backwards.
[491:22.74]But actually it would kill him.
[491:27.19]You're right, never mind.
[491:30.75]It would just tear through his chest, you're right.
[491:35.99]Alright, this is the cold weather clothes.
[491:39.47]Fur robe.
[491:40.87]Warm.
[491:42.48]And then it was... Warm hat.
[491:45.94]There you are.
[491:46.36]Thank you very much!
[491:59.28]That's in a Mike Myers spy movie.
[492:02.74]You can afford it.
[492:28.96]I think this might sell!
[492:30.58]It will, that's why I'm gonna take it from you.
[492:33.72]For forty shachararama!
[492:38.71]That's a fucking huge combo.
[492:44.59]Precious metals has decreased.
[492:47.95]Swords has normalized.
[492:52.08]Only a couple more days.
[492:54.82]Before we get to the endgame.
[492:59.78]I need to go into the dungeon.
[493:05.93]Because I'm running out of stuff.
[493:13.39]Wait, hold on.
[493:18.08]Fusion rank 3.
[493:19.04]I- I- I- Store expansion level 20.
[493:22.06]My god.
[493:28.93]Too close for the old man.
[493:35.13]Yeah, I gotta get into the dungeon.
[493:38.93]Tomorrow's a dungeon day.
[493:39.99]Because I'm out.
[493:46.99]I'm out.
[493:49.12]Ooh, Durian.
[493:57.64]I'll take it.
[494:09.48]Running an errand?
[494:10.16]How much is this?
[494:11.10]Ooh.
[494:13.60]Just get it off the shelf.
[494:15.42]It's been sitting there for too long.
[494:24.49]He wants the helmet.
[494:27.23]100.
[494:27.27]That's too much.
[494:27.93]125.
[494:28.05]He'll buy it.
[494:29.83]Shit.
[494:31.93]Sorry.
[494:32.45]Whatever.
[494:33.19]Fuck.
[494:41.05]I need to scream to wake the people up that... No, I'm not gonna scream.
[494:49.30]Here's what I'm gonna do.
[494:54.08]Hey.
[494:54.78]Hey.
[494:57.82]I know you're sleeping right now, but what you should do... Wake up just a... There you go.
[495:02.40]Hey.
[495:03.30]Wake up a little bit.
[495:03.92]Wake up.
[495:04.62]There you go.
[495:06.00]You probably should just turn it off and just roll over and you can go right to bed.
[495:11.65]They just hit, like, the top button on the iPad.
[495:14.27]The little... Have a great sleep.
[495:19.36]We'll hopefully see you again soon.
[495:21.70]Have a great night.
[495:22.46]Good night.
[495:28.04]I was thinking about screaming really loud there, but why would I do that to people?
[495:33.58]Oh, no, no, no, no!
[495:35.76]Why is it still out there?
[495:40.99]God damn it.
[495:42.09]Whatever.
[495:43.69]I gotta get more inventory.
[495:51.57]This is bad.
[495:52.35]I guess this is bad.
[495:55.23]I have no more leverage.
[495:58.91]I'm using air horn.
[496:03.63]I would never want to do that to somebody.
[496:11.57]I woke up a few hours ago.
[496:12.61]Right.
[496:12.77]It's like... It's really late.
[496:18.17]It is really late.
[496:18.89]You're right.
[496:19.25]Don't worry.
[496:22.30]It's the last day before I clean up.
[496:27.20]Get that durian up here.
[496:28.68]There it is.
[496:35.44]Beef bowl.
[496:36.06]I got some expensive food up here.
[496:39.99]I got a lot of beef bowls.
[496:54.26]I'm on it.
[496:55.66]Oh, fuck.
[496:56.26]It was... $50 just came in.
[496:57.70]5,000 bits by an anonymous cheerer.
[497:02.58]That's... Anonymous 50 bucks.
[497:07.24]Thank you so much, whoever you are.
[497:11.52]An anonymous cheer.
[497:15.12]I forgot he was streaming.
[497:16.48]I kind of did.
[497:20.23]Thank you for staying up with me, by the way.
[497:25.53]Those of you that are still here, I know we're going really late.
[497:39.45]If you're going to bed, have a great night.
[497:42.98]Take care of yourself.
[497:45.06]The scammer, by the way, is in here.
[497:50.10]Here comes the scam.
[497:57.47]No?
[497:59.25]Buddy, pal, can you get me something metal?
[498:03.01]Do I have any more iron?
[498:09.57]Looks good!
[498:16.25]I almost have the amount of money that I need.
[498:17.91]I need, what?
[498:24.85]I need like, what, 800,000?
[498:25.67]I need like a million dollars.
[498:27.53]To beat the game.
[498:35.59]Accessories has increased.
[498:41.30]I don't have much accessories.
[498:43.78]I have the shell necklace.
[498:44.85]Let's get it up there, Durian.
[498:45.99]That's good.
[498:46.53]Standard charm.
[498:47.17]Get it up there.
[498:48.71]What do we got for a day?
[498:49.87]Alright.
[498:51.01]Hold on.
[498:54.79]Today, too close for the old man.
[498:56.41]I will do that, and then we're gonna go to the dungeon.
[499:07.68]Come on in, old man.
[499:13.32]I'll take some.
[499:16.26]Old man.
[499:17.20]Alright, rich girl wants... I'm doing 300%.
[499:24.24]That is the biggest increase.
[499:26.28]She just got destroyed.
[499:43.96]You got the clothes.
[499:44.88]I do.
[499:48.40]Battle sweater.
[499:49.88]Silk clothes.
[499:52.14]Stamp it.
[499:52.62]19-5.
[499:57.41]I did it.
[500:01.93]I'm gonna do it.
[500:02.67]I'm gonna beat this.
[500:10.50]You want the durian.
[500:11.46]You can take it for 112.
[500:16.52]It's just fun just to sell things.
[500:19.42]It's too addicting.
[500:21.12]I wish they would make this game for iPad.
[500:24.67]Make this game for iPad.
[500:25.89]Remake this game.
[500:28.15]Or do it again.
[500:28.93]Do Receder 2 iPad Edition.
[500:35.79]Two pieces of armor in three days.
[500:37.03]I can do that.
[500:46.25]I'll buy for a thousand.
[500:52.22]Not an app sequel, no.
[500:54.80]Look, I know, there's two.
[500:56.04]I understand.
[500:57.34]Plants vs. Zombies 1 to Plants vs. Zombies 2 was dogshit, okay?
[501:03.65]I will agree with you there.
[501:05.17]But if it was, if they don't have, like, pay $3 to do a lightning strike across the board and kill everything, then it'll be fine.
[501:24.44]Alright, now it's time to go to the dungeon.
[501:30.19]Three days.
[501:30.85]Here we go.
[501:33.87]Let's do it.
[501:35.31]It is dungeon time.
[501:36.37]Level 23.
[501:37.79]What does he have?
[501:40.61]Levit Glove, Magician Staff.
[501:42.00]She's got the... It's her.
[501:43.42]We're gonna stick with her.
[501:46.54]Can she use the Crystal Sword?
[501:47.76]What does she have on?
[501:54.14]I need a better chess piece.
[501:55.60]I'll be right back.
[501:58.79]Oh, fuck.
[501:59.31]Oops, oops, sorry.
[502:04.97]I'm gonna get the sandwich plate.
[502:14.27]Put on the guy at the baseball game that's trying to get you to buy hot dogs.
[502:36.12]Let's do it.
[502:41.05]I got the pure edge on.
[502:42.19]I think this is gonna be the end of this dungeon too.
[502:51.38]25 levels?
[502:52.54]Sounds about right.
[503:08.84]I'm so decked out right now, I'm just going to go.
[503:10.66]Wait, there's a new enemy here.
[503:16.31]I do still need to identify new stuff.
[503:18.37]No, I don't want to pick it up.
[503:31.10]Nothing.
[503:31.40]Come on, block.
[503:35.90]Good.
[503:42.12]Ow.
[503:43.92]I just want to find the boss.
[503:47.90]I've got more money to make.
[503:52.95]Whoa, that's gonna explode.
[504:02.33]Good bow?
[504:03.56]Wooden bow.
[504:05.20]The third area.
[504:06.88]Level 25.
[504:08.60]And you're still dropping wooden bows.
[504:11.94]That can't be right.
[504:13.16]I must have, like, the wrong weapon equipment.
[504:20.19]Oh, fuck.
[504:20.79]That's not good.
[504:21.63]What's that?
[504:22.45]Pop-tart.
[504:24.51]Natural heater.
[504:27.05]Hold on.
[504:27.57]One of those things you... Wait.
[504:29.89]One of those palm heater things?
[504:34.30]The little baggies?
[504:38.74]Interesting.
[504:39.40]Okay.
[504:39.50]Okay.
[504:45.87]I think it's down.
[505:02.56]I felt that one.
[505:08.96]It's called a hottie.
[505:15.52]I always thought they were called CVS brand personal hand warmers.
[505:22.61]Are those the ones that I buy?
[505:30.40]Attack power doubled from me only.
[505:35.22]Now we can kill everything.
[505:49.88]Nice.
[505:50.20]I'll level up one more time here.
[505:51.25]I don't want to be level 23.
[505:52.17]That's the Satan number.
[506:07.10]Don't die, don't die.
[506:08.12]I know I'm getting a little tired and a little slow, but it's alright.
[506:16.28]This is a lot different than just putting numbers in a window.
[506:19.58]Almost there.
[506:37.54]Too many conspiracy vids.
[506:43.16]You're talking about... you're talking about me?
[506:46.40]Conspiracy videos?
[506:54.25]I don't remember making any.
[506:59.49]Oh, oh, oh!
[507:06.25]Because it said the 23 thing.
[507:09.79]No, that's just the... it's just a scary Jim Carrey number.
[507:24.00]Nothing.
[507:24.48]Not even worth picking up.
[507:25.58]Attack power doubled for everyone.
[507:35.36]This is it.
[507:36.46]Let's see what's at the bottom of the ocean here.
[507:41.04]Skip.
[507:54.90]Skip I'm gonna go through everybody again.
[508:08.53]Just go I got plenty of food I'll make sure before I go into that I eat the melon whatever the hell I have
[508:26.48]120.
[508:27.60]Roast chicken.
[508:28.36]That's a giant turkey leg.
[508:30.68]I'll take it.
[508:31.18]A lot of damage.
[508:45.63]Copy.
[508:54.26]Oh!
[509:22.52]I don't want to do that again.
[509:27.81]God damn it.
[509:28.59]I gotta do it again.
[509:29.33]Let's go.
[509:29.92]Hurry up.
[509:31.54]Hurry up.
[509:32.34]Let's go.
[509:32.86]Let's go.
[509:33.22]Let's go.
[509:33.54]Let's go.
[509:33.86]Let's go.
[509:34.18]Let's go.
[509:53.91]Damn, I just, like, rewound my brain.
[509:56.67]Just... I'm going.
[509:57.55]I'm not even opening any... That's worth it.
[510:00.63]No, it's not.
[510:01.59]Okay.
[510:02.01]I'm not gonna open any chests.
[510:02.95]We're just gonna... Are we good?
[510:12.38]I think we're good.
[510:13.18]Everybody okay?
[510:25.39]Just narrow to a run through the whole level.
[510:30.01]SP consumption halved.
[510:31.88]You know what that means.
[510:56.94]Don't!
[511:00.73]Nothing, come on.
[511:01.97]Alright, now I just need to level up.
[511:07.71]Alright, I'm not gonna lie, I just, like, hard blinked three times.
[511:26.36]I can't give up.
[511:27.29]I'm almost there.
[511:34.09]Don't kill me, please.
[511:35.17]I always got a million dollars.
[511:39.08]I just gotta spend the million.
[511:43.02]Alright.
[511:43.84]Now this is where I'm gonna level up.
[512:02.60]Oh, I'll take it.
[512:05.09]25.
[512:05.37]I'll be level 25 at floor 25.
[512:35.76]Almost.
[512:36.08]23, 24... I thought that was a ham.
[512:38.86]Well, I leveled up.
[512:39.76]Now run.
[513:07.36]Eight and a half hours.
[513:08.14]We're still fine.
[513:08.66]This ain't even close to my, like, all-time high stream.
[513:14.91]Got a long way to go.
[513:17.71]My longest stream was, like, 13 hours or something.
[513:20.34]This is, like, eight and a half.
[513:34.70]Yeah, now typically I sit somewhere between, like, six and seven and a half.
[513:41.18]Not today.
[513:51.51]Simpsons hit and run?
[513:52.21]That was, uh, wasn't that 11?
[513:55.83]How long was Simpsons hit?
[513:56.80]Was it, was that actually... I thought it was that, um, Lifeline game.
[514:27.16]The floors are just so huge.
[514:28.78]Look at how big this is.
[514:29.90]This is massive.
[514:42.09]This is so big.
[514:47.75]Break the record?
[514:48.49]I don't think I would... Even if I did... I'm going to do... I'm going to beat the dead.
[514:54.37]Even if I did that... I'm assuming another probably 45 minutes to an hour.
[514:58.17]We're not going to come even close to the record.
[515:02.88]Alright.
[515:14.51]Here we go.
[515:17.90]I think I'm going to try to level up one more time here.
[515:23.41]It's probably worth it considering this is probably one of the last boss areas for the death storyline.
[515:33.88]I could be wrong.
[515:34.72]I'm not even going to attack the fire, guys.
[515:36.04]It's just guaranteed death.
[515:47.64]Ooh, what's this?
[515:49.46]Cutlet bowl.
[515:51.22]I love chicken cutlets.
[515:54.60]They knew there's like my favorite food on Earth and they're just taunting me with it now.
[515:58.72]What is that?
[516:03.86]Fin.
[516:04.40]Fin fan.
[516:12.76]I like cold chicken cutlets.
[516:16.30]I'm not even... I don't think that's even a weird thing to say.
[516:19.14]They're cooked.
[516:27.49]You cook them.
[516:28.19]You bread them.
[516:28.65]You cook them.
[516:29.01]You fry them up.
[516:30.31]And then... You put them in the fridge.
[516:33.57]And you eat them cold.
[516:34.59]Like a sandwich.
[516:35.17]A little bit of mayonnaise.
[516:37.45]A little bit of Swiss cheese.
[516:41.64]Maybe... And I knew I didn't want to touch any chests, and this is the number one reason why.
[516:46.40]This is the reason you're looking at right now.
[516:47.92]That's why I didn't want to even touch one.
[517:03.10]What am I going to eat?
[517:05.66]My options are going to be pretty limited in like an hour or so.
[517:17.71]No fire guys, right?
[517:18.82]Alright, just kill the pumpkin and I can level up.
[517:28.12]Level up!
[517:28.89]Alright.
[517:30.15]This is it.
[517:31.17]I need to pay attention here because... I'm only gonna get one shot at this, so this is it for the night.
[517:39.34]Two fire guys.
[517:41.16]Just avoid them.
[517:47.66]What if a boss is in here?
[517:48.64]This is the last shot until I erase the dead.
[517:58.88]Ugh.
[518:03.10]Too much.
[518:04.46]Go around.
[518:05.38]Alright, here we go.
[518:17.45]It's double slime.
[518:21.25]Double slime.
[518:22.09]What the fuck was that?
[519:08.82]Oh, don't get greedy here.
[519:10.00]That would be a mistake.
[519:12.17]Destin case.
[519:16.25]He's won.
[519:30.05]There's two.
[519:30.73]And I got two slimes.
[519:33.19]Hooray!
[519:33.61]There's even more to go down here.
[519:37.21]Ayayay.
[519:39.99]At least I get to keep everything.
[519:47.94]I just wanna see.
[519:51.70]26 to 30.
[519:51.92]Shit.
[519:53.22]Alright, well, whatever.
[519:53.96]I got debt to pay.
[519:59.85]I've seen this already.
[520:00.55]I don't have much else to sell.
[520:06.54]I need to go buy some stuff.
[520:10.78]Dead is tomorrow, so I can... I got a $32,000 book.
[521:03.62]Alright, I got a ton of incredibly expensive items.
[521:11.05]I think we've already seen this, I believe.
[521:14.75]Yeah, we've already seen this.
[521:16.67]Actually, maybe we didn't.
[521:19.05]Alright, time for bed.
[521:22.64]Bad financial decisions.
[521:23.60]No, those are going to be good financial decisions in about 20 minutes.
[521:27.42]Good morning.
[521:31.17]News, the price of sweets has increased.
[521:34.33]The price of valuable things has normalized.
[521:38.01]Alright.
[521:45.95]Crystal, look at 28 grand.
[521:47.89]I'm going to hold these until this.
[521:49.55]You see what I'm saying?
[521:52.29]These are going to be worth like 80 to $100,000 each.
[521:53.93]Let's put the snacks up here.
[522:09.48]I have plenty of this stuff.
[522:11.46]Alright, what else?
[522:12.12]We gotta move here.
[522:16.31]Place the stuff in here.
[522:18.37]With... Fur balls.
[522:21.49]I'm not gonna do this anymore.
[522:22.57]I am done with that.
[522:30.21]I don't get time for that right now.
[522:31.89]Open the store.
[522:37.92]Can I buy this?
[522:38.54]Yeah, I'll buy it.
[522:48.60]Somebody bought something.
[522:51.80]There we go.
[522:53.94]+2 grapes.
[522:56.94]There you go.
[523:00.03]3,000.
[523:03.19]I can expand the shop again for the final stretch.
[523:07.77]That's a pretty good necklace.
[523:11.03]5200.
[523:12.63]Another yam.
[523:13.17]I'll just be normal here.
[523:19.31]Back over 500k.
[523:36.36]Ooh.
[523:37.44]I'll take it.
[523:37.96]You have something warm.
[523:43.33]Uh-oh.
[523:45.51]I think I do.
[523:46.83]Boots?
[524:09.19]I guess I don't.
[524:16.56]Wait, can I give her the heater?
[524:17.88]The cloth hat?
[524:32.37]It's not even here.
[524:35.39]Where is it?
[524:39.92]Oh, the heater is lost, right.
[524:41.18]Will you take the shoes?
[524:45.80]I'll give you the hat.
[524:48.12]Yeah, the nice warm hat.
[524:53.09]Level 20, come on.
[524:54.27]Yes!
[524:55.49]Bigger shop.
[524:58.07]Let's go do it.
[525:02.67]Expansion.
[525:03.23]$30,000 to expand.
[525:03.87]Let's go.
[525:09.04]Let me see the fusion, though.
[525:10.14]Rank 1, dagger.
[525:12.66]This is... Alright, hold on.
[525:13.84]What about... Do I have any Rank 2 stuff unlocked?
[525:16.74]I can make some stuff.
[525:24.61]Ooh, wait a minute.
[525:25.53]Rank 3, treasure.
[525:31.83]Rank 3, food.
[525:34.43]Egg toast, shark fins.
[525:36.63]And I can make Rank 3...
[525:42.39]Let's make this stuff though.
[525:43.77]I have this stuff.
[525:44.49]Mermaid Shoes.
[525:46.33]They're really expensive.
[525:47.43]Let's do the Knight's Helm.
[525:51.60]Again, 9,000.
[525:58.51]Let's also do this one more thing I could do, right?
[526:01.43]Rank 1 Dagger.
[526:02.21]5,200. 5,200.
[526:13.52]This is too big.
[526:15.76]Oh man, this is huge.
[526:17.72]What happened to my vending machine?
[526:30.70]Did you take my vending machine?
[526:31.70]I was gonna say, that was fuckin' $30,000.
[526:38.32]Two windows, though.
[526:39.30]Pretty important.
[526:41.74]Suites are still high?
[526:46.23]Let's get a peach tin in the window.
[526:47.29]Let's get the honey in the window too.
[526:49.79]I need money.
[526:50.81]Baked yam.
[526:55.00]Is that in the way?
[526:55.58]Baked yam.
[527:01.54]Candy apple.
[527:02.82]Candy apple.
[527:07.42]Teriyaki.
[527:08.47]Hurricane bow.
[527:16.46]Hold on to that.
[527:19.66]Perfume staff.
[527:25.43]Silver gauntlet.
[527:27.23]Silver gauntlet.
[527:30.61]All the really expensive stuff I'm not gonna sell.
[527:32.37]Let's just get them out here.
[527:33.59]Just like a clothing store.
[527:43.02]Not selling that.
[527:43.66]Not selling that.
[527:45.81]Put these up.
[527:47.37]No, get that off.
[527:53.93]Move the windows?
[527:58.25]Uh, I can't do it right now.
[528:03.97]I have to move this.
[528:07.66]Move tables.
[528:20.09]I wish this was centered Do it again That's fine right there
[528:49.16]Alright, hold on.
[528:55.67]Wait, wait, wait.
[528:57.85]I got a lot of junk.
[529:00.93]Cherries.
[529:03.15]Double cherry.
[529:04.01]And let's load up the... The Vendigo.
[529:10.07]Okay.
[529:18.25]Can I turn it?
[529:45.93]It's the sands.
[529:56.88]Oh, fuck it.
[529:57.42]I don't care.
[529:57.98]They can just stay there.
[529:58.90]Just put the vending machine here.
[530:00.44]It's fine.
[530:08.02]There's nothing wrong with it.
[530:32.40]Open the store!
[530:38.44]Two treasures.
[530:40.22]I'll pick them up in two days.
[530:48.11]I could use a weapon, could you?
[530:52.52]I don't want to give you the expensive one.
[530:59.37]I'll give you the, um... Hurricane bow.
[531:14.20]I would complain at this door non-stop.
[531:15.90]Well, that's fine.
[531:17.04]I would... I would say... Mm-hmm.
[531:19.14]Yep.
[531:19.38]Mm-hmm.
[531:19.72]Mm-hmm.
[531:20.18]Okay.
[531:20.54]Mm-hmm.
[531:20.90]Thank you for your feedback, sir.
[531:29.42]Got it.
[531:32.50]No, shit.
[531:33.86]No, no, no, no.
[531:34.62]I'll give you base price for it.
[531:37.56]You're fucking ruining my shit here.
[531:38.78]I'll give you one.
[531:39.28]No, I'll give you... Just get out of here.
[531:40.52]Get away from me.
[531:45.72]Your family heirloom is like peaches in a can.
[531:48.72]Why does everybody's family heirloom suck?
[531:50.92]Alright, grandpa's gonna buy the honey.
[532:03.73]I'd like some clothes.
[532:04.87]I got something for you.
[532:05.93]I have a windbreaker, sir.
[532:11.45]600 bucks.
[532:12.79]Stamp it.
[532:20.78]I am procuring this item.
[532:23.36]For 4,200 dollars.
[532:30.86]More sweets.
[532:32.04]Come on, Grandpa.
[532:33.80]No, I don't... Just to keep the combo going.
[532:46.08]The price of food has decreased.
[532:48.46]The price of accessories has normalized.
[532:52.14]Come on.
[532:55.24]I need weapons to go up so that I can beat the game instantly.
[533:02.08]Look at this.
[533:02.52]I got so many great items.
[533:14.85]This reopens the store.
[533:15.65]I got it.
[533:16.25]Mermaid shoes.
[533:18.93]Anything here worth money?
[533:22.95]Top stone.
[533:25.39]No, no, no, no.
[533:26.91]I'm gonna put the book out.
[533:27.83]I mean, this is 30.
[533:28.29]That's an easy $30,000 to $40,000 right there.
[533:34.96]This can stay out.
[533:36.28]Anything in here?
[533:36.82]Yeah.
[533:37.08]Restock this with toothpicks.
[533:44.15]Uh, just... Whatever, put this stuff in here too.
[533:46.39]I don't even want it.
[533:50.37]Just free money.
[533:52.27]Reopen.
[533:53.29]Two pieces of armor in three days.
[533:56.85]Yep.
[534:07.93]I'm looking for a snack.
[534:15.01]You got class tomorrow.
[534:16.51]Well, go study!
[534:19.29]It better be an economics class, otherwise you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing.
[534:23.10]Ooh.
[534:37.36]Alright, I'll do straight up Tengriya.
[534:50.16]This thing sucks.
[534:52.61]You can just have it.
[534:53.17]I should have put that thing in the vending machine.
[534:58.55]What am I doing?
[534:59.01]Alright.
[535:07.82]It starts at 8 a.m.
[535:15.68]Alright, this is where the game ends.
[535:18.46]This is where we end.
[535:20.98]$200,000 is coming out tonight.
[535:24.30]What's the... What has to be one of the last ones?
[535:27.82]I have 300 grand.
[535:29.64]How much do I need next week?
[535:36.97]Is it a million?
[535:40.00]800,000?
[535:40.02]600,000?
[535:40.12]I mean, 200,000 might sound like not very much, but it is a lot.
[535:47.62]So... $50 just came in.
[535:51.74]From Cyclops Parker.
[535:53.47]Thank you for the 50 bucks.
[535:56.29]This game is propaganda.
[536:00.51]Thank you for the $50.05.
[536:01.33]You went up a little bit there.
[536:04.75]Thank you, though.
[536:05.45]Really appreciate that.
[536:08.50]The rusty daggers boom has ended.
[536:12.00]Today's dungeon index, 70, whatever.
[536:19.91]Alright, here we go.
[536:20.55]Uh, what's the, what is it?
[536:25.37]It's $500,000.
[536:26.49]I can do it.
[536:27.61]I've only got one more week to make 500 grand.
[536:32.98]I can, I definitely can do this shit.
[536:34.94]Let's get the knight, let's get some weapons out here.
[536:46.45]Not the expensive ones.
[536:52.95]There's still stuff in there.
[536:54.72]Bring him in.
[536:56.16]All I care about is money.
[537:05.26]Somebody told me that even if you go back and get a bunch of items, at this level you might get reset again for like Phase 3.
[537:14.74]I think I'm good.
[537:22.22]I just can't buy anything.
[537:27.29]Here we are.
[537:29.89]No, no, no, no.
[537:31.09]Make it a... No, 1180 is fine.
[537:37.19]It is the final payment, but I can't purchase anything.
[537:41.33]I just have to sell all my inventory.
[537:49.86]And this is a scenario where I will liquidate stuff if I have to.
[537:57.25]Wait, he wanted the armor.
[537:58.35]Uh-oh.
[538:00.73]Oh, don't worry.
[538:01.89]I got it.
[538:06.70]for the money.
[538:17.73]Buy blue shit.
[538:18.93]I did.
[538:19.35]What do you think is out there?
[538:20.47]I bought like three blue items like six days ago.
[538:34.36]These were... Look.
[538:36.89]This was blue.
[538:37.78]This was blue.
[538:40.08]This was blue.
[538:40.78]This was blue.
[538:41.46]I already did it!
[538:42.28]Alright, tomorrow, two treasures.
[538:52.77]Uh, I'm gonna have to buy them.
[539:01.85]Yeah, I gotta go buy two treasures.
[539:17.49]I know he told me I was not supposed to buy anything, but I did.
[539:23.45]No, no more buying things.
[539:42.56]I'll get over there once a weapon surge happens.
[539:46.09]I'll be good to go.
[539:49.90]alright here we go
[540:24.86]What's that doing out right now?
[540:28.02]Take it, go!
[540:39.51]Sell candy apple, I'll take it for 50%.
[540:41.15]Really?
[540:52.58]125 is safe.
[540:56.58]I'm not supposed to be buying stuff.
[540:59.77]I'm not supposed to be buying things.
[541:25.93]Stop selling me things!
[541:27.66]I'll take it.
[541:28.04]I need one day of weapons.
[541:36.46]Alright.
[541:39.69]I can't fuck this up, come on.
[541:47.85]Seriously.
[541:59.16]This game came out in 2007.
[542:00.48]Yeah, it's pretty good, too.
[542:02.86]It's really fun.
[542:05.52]You want a piece of armor?
[542:06.36]I think I got some good stuff here.
[542:10.18]Yeah, take the iron.
[542:20.10]118.
[542:25.08]How we doing?
[542:31.18]I got like six days.
[542:32.12]I'm fine.
[542:32.96]Where's the person that comes in?
[542:34.50]What happened to the double treasure?
[542:36.12]Tomorrow?
[542:40.76]Tomorrow.
[542:41.28]Two treasures.
[542:41.93]I should get about 40 to 50 grand from this.
[542:43.49]I need two.
[542:47.81]Okay, so tomorrow is... I got one more day here.
[542:51.09]Let's get the iron up there.
[542:55.60]And give me... If I don't get a surge of weapons very soon here, I'm gonna have to start putting this shit out.
[543:11.55]No one's buying the book either.
[543:12.53]That's fine.
[543:18.37]Come on in.
[543:22.41]I need two books.
[543:23.69]Can I come and pick them in two days?
[543:26.78]Oh, yeah, you can.
[543:27.46]I'm taking that thing off the shelf.
[543:30.96]Does this guy have, like, $60,000, though?
[543:33.14]I'm taking the book off the shelf.
[543:46.57]Look at the armor.
[543:48.95]Let's try to... Let's stay around, like, 120.
[543:50.11]That's a safe, good amount.
[543:53.67]And if I... As long as I do that...
[544:03.19]Okay, 120.
[544:10.21]Do a joke and delete your save.
[544:23.71]That would not be a very funny joke considering that would be a... 18 hour long joke.
[544:36.53]That would be an 18 to 20 hour long joke.
[544:41.77]Two days in the making.
[544:44.31]Holy objects.
[544:45.99]Prices for fur balls are falling.
[544:47.68]Wait, what do you mean holy?
[544:48.58]These are not holy objects?
[544:52.64]What's a holy object?
[544:53.56]Alright, prices on candy apples out of there.
[545:12.93]No one wants to buy the bread?
[545:13.95]They'll buy the cherries, right?
[545:18.75]Swiss cheese is a holy object.
[545:23.48]I know.
[545:26.36]Oh, I want to get the book off.
[545:27.14]So we're going to do Booze of the World and Just Eat It.
[545:39.84]There are the two... Let's put this up.
[545:46.45]That looks good.
[545:47.15]Put the cloth up there.
[545:51.27]Common shield.
[545:52.01]That's fine.
[545:52.59]We're in a space here.
[545:55.35]Alright.
[545:58.08]Let's go.
[545:58.56]Get in here.
[546:17.71]That's exactly what I'm looking for.
[546:19.21]Yes, it is.
[546:20.03]2200.
[546:20.09]Just sell your Australian rocket launcher for 22 yams.
[546:29.44]There we are.
[546:33.08]Let me go around like 130 for this.
[546:39.07]Back down to 120.
[546:48.77]I want to buy two clothes in three days.
[546:50.39]I'll take it.
[546:51.93]Alright, where is my treasure person?
[546:59.41]My daughter-in-law asked me to pick up a night shell.
[547:01.47]122.
[547:01.49]I'm less than 170... What, 135,000 away?
[547:08.43]Just need one good day.
[547:09.01]There it is.
[547:19.10]10 grand.
[547:19.58]Take it.
[547:32.85]Do you have the things I asked for?
[547:34.15]The two treasures?
[547:35.23]I do.
[547:35.81]This is gonna be a big one.
[547:38.01]25,000. 25,000.
[547:44.52]Fifty... $60,000.
[547:48.39]That's reasonable.
[547:51.91]Alright, alright, alright.
[547:54.07]Just because I don't want to lose the game.
[547:55.83]$52,000.
[547:57.71]It's in the bag.
[548:09.68]Price of precious metals has decreased.
[548:12.86]Price of food has normalized.
[548:14.60]The big items.
[548:16.88]I got like four days.
[548:22.68]Get this off.
[548:27.74]How are we doing on cheap shit?
[548:32.78]More cheap shit.
[548:33.50]I'll take it.
[548:43.25]Alright, alright, okay, okay?
[548:45.27]Alright.
[548:45.69]Alright, everything's fine.
[548:52.43]Expensive stuff's going up.
[549:13.69]Which one should I choose?
[549:17.51]Which one should I choose?
[549:20.28]Which one should I put?
[549:43.89]That's fine.
[549:48.29]What can I fill in this last box?
[549:50.19]Uh, roast chicken.
[549:55.17]Ham sandwich in the window.
[549:58.17]We're good.
[550:00.07]Here comes the big money.
[550:01.15]You got some food.
[550:06.61]I do.
[550:08.51]Yes, I do.
[550:09.49]I got a roast chicken ham sandwich.
[550:10.83]I got the cutlet, right?
[550:11.65]Take this.
[550:17.48]Ten thousand.
[550:24.92]Somebody buy the bow.
[550:26.52]Somebody buy one of these.
[550:30.14]My grandmother treasured this.
[550:35.82]Sure she did.
[550:42.47]Fuck.
[550:48.25]Somebody buy something expensive!
[550:50.97]It looks good- Grandpa.
[550:53.89]Oh, Grandpa.

[551:07.44]Bingo.
[551:08.96]30 grand.
[551:13.18]I'm not gonna get greedy with this, though.
[551:14.76]Let's do 35,000.
[551:21.28]I just need one or two more of those, and the debt is paid.
[551:32.13]Why would you pawn a half-melted chocolate bar?
[551:38.67]Because you're insane.
[551:39.69]So close.
[551:45.62]Bring him in again.
[551:46.40]Let's go.
[551:46.92]I'm not even gonna put any new inventory there.
[551:48.16]Let's go.
[551:48.50]Bring him in.
[551:51.27]Do I have a weapon?
[551:52.54]Yup.
[551:55.26]Can you afford this?
[551:58.18]Oh!
[551:58.90]Alright, we're fine.
[552:09.80]We're fine.
[552:10.30]He bought it.
[552:10.92]Even if it was base price, it doesn't matter.
[552:12.77]I only need a little bit more. ...
[552:30.11]There's the fishing pole 120 you'll buy it Staff the super sandwich
[552:55.34]Count down the clock.
[553:05.10]I have three, four days to do it.
[553:08.11]I got plenty of time.
[553:13.83]Good morning.
[553:14.93]Good morning, tier.
[553:16.17]So the final payment is due in a week.
[553:17.99]It will be sizable.
[553:18.99]I recommend checking the pause menu in order to see how much you owe for this week.
[553:22.33]Can't you just tell me now?
[553:25.65]Well, are you quite sure you wish me to do that?
[553:29.67]I'll just check on my own, I think.
[553:31.25]Very good.
[553:31.65]Please prepare yourself.
[553:34.14]I hope I can actually pay this off.
[553:37.90]Okie dokie.
[553:41.32]Price of longswords has increased.
[553:44.92]And accessories have normalized.
[553:46.60]Longswords.
[553:47.92]Just get some crystal swords up here.
[553:52.46]I know I'm not getting an increase from this, but I gotta entice people.
[553:57.75]Any more food I can put out here?
[554:14.92]I'll put a beef bowl.
[554:15.56]Time to win.
[554:23.79]Game over, I win.
[554:32.83]I can relax for the next four days.
[554:37.99]You got something made out of metal?
[554:40.86]Uh-huh.
[554:42.04]Wait, is this made out of crystals?
[554:43.20]Does that count?
[555:02.67]Ooh, I came for the armor, right.
[555:07.49]Does that count?
[555:12.30]Let's be safe here.
[555:32.07]I crossed it!
[555:34.91]500,000, hooray!
[555:37.83]You do have the books I asked for, yeah.
[555:40.23]Let's go way over here.
[555:44.37]Just eat it, and booze of the world.
[555:46.44]40 grand, please.
[555:48.08]35,000, please.
[555:50.58]Oh, he's gone.
[555:51.06]Your loss.
[555:51.28]I don't even need the money.
[556:01.31]Came to get my weapons.
[556:06.59]You want two crystal swords, man?
[556:08.09]Oof.
[556:08.17]Take it.
[556:08.91]320.
[556:08.93]Oh, he's way overboard.
[556:17.22]Now I got 600k.
[556:22.40]Good game.
[556:37.36]So the final thing I'm going to do, I have money.
[556:39.14]Here's the last thing that I'm going to do.
[556:41.24]I'm going to try to get to the end of the dungeon.
[556:46.46]As long as I'm not an idiot.
[556:48.70]And don't blow all my money.
[556:50.76]I will have enough.
[556:55.95]Let's try it.
[556:57.01]Let's see what the end of the dungeon is.
[556:58.05]We'll do it tomorrow.
[557:02.25]I'm so sad.
[557:02.85]I'm so sad.
[557:07.60]Uh, let's just try to sell the last little bits of stuff that I have.
[557:10.52]Uh, I'm gonna put the turkey leg up there.
[557:26.32]Roast.
[557:27.94]Turkey.
[557:30.04]And we'll put, uh, the peach thing.
[557:41.09]Two clothes, I want them in three days.
[557:44.26]Get out of my store.
[557:48.70]I get to do that now.
[557:49.56]I get to say, get out of here.
[557:50.52]I'll take it.
[557:56.97]I'll take it.
[557:57.29]Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[557:58.15]I'll take it.
[557:58.87]What do you want for it?
[558:01.19]I'll give you 10,000 for it.
[558:01.93]I'll give you 10,500.
[558:03.93]I'll give you 12 for it.
[558:17.00]My wife wanted me to pick up this helmet.
[558:25.17]Day for 500,000.
[558:29.25]Turkey leg had a good placement, I guess.
[558:30.81]There's still game after the last payment.
[558:36.90]I know this.
[558:38.12]I'm not gonna stream for another seven hours to do the rest of the actual ending ending of this game.
[558:45.38]I just said I wanted to pay the debt off.
[558:48.56]Where are you guys getting these vases?
[559:06.42]This feels weird.
[559:07.92]Why are there this many people with these grandma vases?
[559:17.96]I thought he said poison.
[559:47.03]It's the grandma overpopulation crisis.
[559:52.71]Alright, let's get to the end of the dungeon.
[559:54.95]As of tomorrow.
[559:57.37]I got one more shot here of let's just put some candy and some chocolate and let's just load it up.
[560:03.72]Actually, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[560:12.18]I'll put some chocolate in here.
[560:14.22]Put in some flooring.
[560:16.16]No matter.
[560:18.36]Just don't put anything in here.
[560:19.58]Put in, like, the toothpicks, gunpowder.
[560:21.39]Do I have any other things?
[560:27.27]Let's get the... Actually, the big swords and stuff up here.
[560:30.41]Might as well display them.
[560:36.73]I have them.
[560:49.18]Put the book over here.
[560:50.06]Alright.
[560:54.36]Come on in.
[560:58.76]Do a closing sale or you sell everything?
[561:00.58]Yeah, I was going to see if I could sell everything at like 80% off.
[561:14.38]I'm gonna do it.
[561:18.41]I'm gonna do it How much money do I have

[562:43.05]Did you just pay for the ocean, uh, wall?
[562:45.27]You may have.
[562:49.23]150k.

[563:19.83]Just get the halberd up here.
[563:29.79]After I sold everything, I know, right?
[563:31.31]Really.
[563:31.59]That's a pain in the ass.
[563:39.31]Alright, I'm gonna go to the, uh...

[564:40.51]Ow.
[564:41.83]Can't believe I'm keeping my promise of finishing the game today.
[564:44.91]Well, I'm not really finishing the game as much as I am getting to the end of the part that I want to get to the end at on screen.
[564:54.32]They're doing a lot of damage.
[564:56.24]I probably need to slow down here.
[565:00.32]Yeah, I gotta slow down.
[565:12.08]Am I gonna play this off-stream?
[565:14.62]Uh, probably.
[565:20.28]I think Kim would think it was fun.
[565:24.27]I'm gonna do a Kim and Jeremy stream this game, but not live.
[565:35.59]He'll be streaming it to me.
[565:38.09]And then I get to be you guys!
[565:39.35]I get to hang out and be you!
[565:47.27]Yeah, I'm just gonna be, like, in the bathroom.
[565:50.51]She's gonna do a private, like, steam stream.
[565:55.21]Don't blow up!
[565:56.23]Don't blow up!
[565:56.87]Don't blow up!
[565:59.53]I'm gonna take, like, a four hour long dump.
[566:02.19]And she's just gonna stream the game to me.
[566:04.49]I need a heal.
[566:04.99]I was trying to kill the little guy.
[566:36.87]God, how many?
[566:37.95]How many avalanches can you have in a row?
[566:55.96]News.
[566:56.46]Movement speed increased for everyone.
[566:58.36]Oh, this is gonna be bad.
[566:59.54]This is a bad idea.
[567:05.21]But, I'm just gonna keep... I'll level up on the next floor.
[567:11.51]Found it perfectly.
[567:12.23]I feel like I'm doing a Mephisto run.
[567:15.08]Oh god, I found it!
[567:15.84]Nice, good!
[567:17.04]I'm gonna level up here.
[567:34.93]Where'd that come from?
[567:43.92]Egg toast.
[567:47.30]Pumpkins give go to EXP.
[567:48.88]Drop.
[567:49.92]I can't believe that just dropped into that.
[568:03.29]Don't die.
[568:03.75]I swear.
[568:04.71]I might have to take an Emergency Cherry, but I don't know if it's worth it.
[568:12.40]I'm so close to 27.
[568:14.06]Yeah, I'm gonna take an Emergency Cherry.
[568:29.74]Not ready yet.
[568:31.53]I want to get... I want 27.
[568:32.81]These places are huge.
[568:39.17]At least I know where I'm going.
[568:41.49]Where did I come from?
[568:53.74]I'm running with the grass.
[569:09.85]Knocked out cold.
[569:16.71]Leather armor.
[569:17.41]I haven't really played the game for this long and I still haven't seen leather armor.
[569:21.46]27.
[569:22.26]There it is.
[569:25.30]Let's get the hell out of here.
[569:28.02]Okay.
[569:48.43]Boss time.
[569:48.89]Is something wrong?
[569:55.01]Is someone over there?
[569:56.21]It looks like a girl.
[569:57.19]A girl my age.
[570:00.95]A girl in a place like this?
[570:02.59]I think she's crying.
[570:04.09]She's perhaps lost.
[570:05.73]Yeah, that's got to be it.
[570:06.55]We need to help her.
[570:09.19]Is this the lost girl?
[570:11.47]This deep in a dungeon?
[570:12.31]Yeah, this is the girl that's been walking around in circles.
[570:15.31]Wait, what?
[570:17.34]Yeah, it is.
[570:26.72]I'm supposed to be reading.
[570:27.74]Don't come near me.
[570:29.52]Hey, what?
[570:30.14]Don't come any closer, nasty human person.
[570:35.01]What are you?
[570:35.29]What are you?
[570:35.61]Human person.
[570:36.69]Get away.
[570:37.05]Get away from me.
[570:39.79]Oh, so she's turning red.
[570:44.23]This girl, I'm sure of it, she's an elf.
[570:47.36]What?
[570:47.68]No.
[570:52.05]You mean to tell me those aren't apple slices on her head?
[570:56.39]What?
[570:59.73]I don't think we have time to wonder.
[571:01.23]Let's fight her.
[571:02.29]What's with this Q-Brit bullshit?
[571:28.26]Oh, it's a puzzle one.
[571:39.61]Where?
[571:40.01]She's in the corner?
[571:40.93]Oh no!
[571:51.62]Give me a Spurge and a Jerry!
[572:15.36]Whoa!
[572:16.02]Where are you going?
[572:17.75]Okay, how the fu-
[572:48.03]Watermelon!
[572:49.13]Give me the watermelon.
[572:49.93]I need it.
[573:03.90]I win.
[573:17.06]There's too many people.
[573:18.04]There's too many people.
[573:20.42]There's too many fucking people everywhere.
[573:35.57]What was that tracking?
[573:37.11]Fuck.
[573:40.97]It's too late for this.
[573:42.73]It's too late for this.
[573:43.95]It's too late for this.
[573:55.47]I don't care.
[573:55.87]I win.
[573:56.31]Dude, it's too late for this.
[573:58.17]It's fucking almost 10 straight hours of this shit.
[574:05.17]I don't want to take anything.
[574:06.07]I don't care.
[574:07.71]Pay my debt and get me the fuck out of here.
[574:09.15]That was ridiculous.
[574:21.48]You're like ten of those fox people throwing rocks at you the whole time.
[574:25.04]Alright, everyone just take everything at base price.
[574:38.82]Can I sleep in the bed for two days straight?
[574:43.40]Can I just sleep?
[574:44.40]I did it!
[575:05.55]Just go back and- right, I can just go in and out of town repeatedly.
[575:10.01]Holy shit!
[575:12.19]Louie, Louie, you're not actually gonna buy this, are you?
[575:21.14]Louie, Louie, this is way out of your budget.
[575:30.91]He bought that on credit.
[575:32.69]He just went down to Bank of America and he got a loan to pay for that.
[575:38.63]Hey, I'm feeling generous today.
[575:41.66]What is that?
[575:42.30]You want to sell me a watermelon?
[575:43.74]How's your grandma doing, by the way?
[575:45.66]Is grandma okay?
[575:48.10]Where did you get it from?
[575:49.08]Oh, I would love it!
[575:57.98]Everybody out.
[575:58.79]This door's closed.
[576:03.71]Oh.
[576:17.74]It's fair.
[576:18.28]Yeah, 2,000% increase.
[576:18.64]Out of this door.
[576:19.58]Everybody out.
[576:21.80]I'm going to bed.
[576:22.36]Nice.
[576:22.58]Okay, goodnight.
[576:44.62]Just start going into the dungeon and instantly dying.
[576:51.98]I kind of want to just buy something from the crazy girl.
[576:56.77]The price of metal has increased.
[576:58.49]Who cares?
[576:59.01]I don't know what day is it.
[577:01.05]Is it cold out today?
[577:01.93]Hmm.
[577:03.95]I think I want to buy... I'm stupid!
[577:08.55]I'll take one!
[577:20.37]What do we have here?
[577:21.05]Woo, these look good!
[577:31.16]This is the thing.
[577:32.20]They put people with too much money.
[577:33.64]This is what they actually do.
[577:35.00]Let's go!
[578:02.19]I just fucking yeeted that thing.
[578:03.97]Oh my god, did you see what he did?
[578:05.35]He just yeeted.
[578:06.79]He just yeeted that thing.
[578:08.13]This guy's kinda cool.
[578:10.34]Oh, he does an uppercut too.
[578:26.33]That's cool.
[578:32.74]We're surrounded!
[578:47.91]Leave him.
[578:52.05]Was that the equivalent of snake?
[578:54.07]Snake!
[578:55.09]SNAKE!
[578:59.31]Goodnight.
[579:09.20]I'm not joking.
[579:09.80]I'm actually fucking crying.
[579:11.68]None of your jokes are funny.
[579:12.94]Your stream is making me cry.
[579:18.95]What are you doing here?
[579:20.71]Why are you doing this to yourself?
[579:22.89]Why are you doing this?
[579:46.18]What's today?
[579:46.60]Ooh, we got one more day.
[579:47.86]I think my voice has changed.
[579:50.96]No, it hasn't.
[579:51.56]I'm fine.
[579:51.88]I just want to see what he does.
[580:14.43]Holy shit, you're the worst character I've ever seen.
[580:17.11]What a shit character.
[580:19.19]What a shitty character.
[580:23.06]Good night.
[580:36.66]Everything is free today.
[581:06.75]Okay
[581:54.44]I had an order, but you weren't around.
[582:01.21]How much is that?
[582:04.47]Well, sir, you came in a great day.
[582:06.59]You came to everything is free day.
[582:17.15]How much is this?
[582:18.35]Usually it's $15,000.
[582:19.35]Thank you very much.
[582:27.65]Thank you very much.
[582:29.54]Thank you very much.
[583:02.75]The nightmare ends.
[583:16.17]Wait, hold on a minute.
[583:19.94]Hold on, I need to do this.
[583:25.54]We're doing a fucking Satan number.
[583:44.28]Hey!
[583:46.03]What just happened?
[583:49.95]I'm interested in buying... No, no, no, no.
[583:51.41]I need to... Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[583:52.23]Hold on.
[583:52.39]$667.
[583:52.41]$667.
[583:52.43]$667.
[583:52.45]$542 minus $666.
[583:52.61]$666.
[583:52.63]$876.
[583:52.65]I'd like to buy that for $876, please.
[584:20.93]Everybody watching this stream.
[584:23.37]Sorry.
[584:24.21]I don't have weapons.
[584:28.44]Oh, you have one of these.
[584:47.71]shit I have to sell it for a dollar nothing scary about six six six six sixty seven I'm gonna buy it finally a pot stand and I'm gonna buy I'm gonna spend way too much money on this
[585:16.01]What, a thousand dollars in?
[585:17.79]A thousand percent?
[585:22.25]Alright, everybody can breathe.
[585:37.90]Thanks for all your help.
[585:38.64]You did so good.
[585:43.61]Welcome to the end of the stream.
[585:45.49]It only took us about 10 hours to get here.
[585:53.24]Paying off the final debt.
[585:54.44]$500,000 with $142,000 left over.
[585:55.09]I did it.
[586:10.66]Congratulations, receipt.
[586:11.66]With this payment, your father's loan has been repaid in full.
[586:15.49]You've worked very hard, receipt.
[586:16.65]Well done.
[586:18.37]So it's all over, right?
[586:19.15]The payments and the weirdness and stuff?
[586:20.93]It's kind of unreal somehow.
[586:22.15]Like, it's over.
[586:22.71]How's that possible?
[586:25.53]Indy.
[586:27.36]May I have a moment?
[586:28.52]Could we step outside, perhaps?
[586:33.02]I don't like this.
[586:38.11]Oh, the evening breeze feels wonderful.
[586:41.05]By the way, I lied.
[586:41.99]This is where the I lied comes up.
[586:45.09]It does.
[586:45.63]I like the city at night like this, looking down from the hill.
[586:49.40]Only five weeks have passed since I arrived here.
[586:52.06]Quite a bit has happened despite the short amount of time.
[586:56.10]I'll say, I never thought I'd have to open an item shop to help pay off one of my papa's bad loans.
[587:03.56]When I arrived here, I expected... No, I deserved nothing but your SCORN and hatred.
[587:08.73]And you always trusted me from the day we met to this very moment, without questioning me once.
[587:14.81]I do not understand it even now.
[587:16.35]How are you capable of such casual trust?
[587:19.44]How can you be so ceaselessly positive about things?
[587:24.11]Um... well um, I don't know- I really understand- I don't know anything.
[587:29.11]But to tell you the truth, when you told me that I had to open an item store to pay off the debt all I could think was that sounds like a lot of fun.
[587:35.11]I met people I never could have dreamed of meeting when I was alone, I got to run a shop, I went on adventures, I got to experience some many things that I ever thought I'd see.
[587:43.11]It was an exciting- just waking up in the morning wondering what happened.
[587:48.11]More important than anything I got to meet you, Tyr.
[587:53.31]I'm happier about that than I am about anything else.
[587:59.36]You say such embarrassing things.
[588:03.38]Oh, I didn't mean to make you blush, Tyr.
[588:05.20]No, no, not at all.
[588:07.24]I'm not blushing.
[588:09.82]I know some scary stuff happened too, but I'm glad I got to experience with you, Tyr.
[588:15.74]Move the cursor?
[588:23.07]Alright, I would laugh my ass off if you went to like Infinity War.
[588:27.79]There's like a fucking cursor on the screen.
[588:32.65]I know what it's like to lose.
[588:35.46]And you're just freaking out.
[588:36.36]Why is that up there?
[588:39.80]Somebody please help!
[588:40.94]Take it off!
[588:47.86]And so, my days of paying back endless debt ended.
[588:52.82]Thank you.
[589:00.13]I win.
[589:00.71]I did it.
[589:01.91]And all I had to do is rewind time and buy like a hundred thousand dollars worth of stuff like seven hours ago.
[589:17.72]I'm not gonna sing with this.
[589:20.37]on the candlestick papa gave to me where's papa I thought we were gonna get a papa comes back and he's like all like dirty and covered in like dragon I'm back is it gonna be an f look there's gonna be a there's gonna be a mouse on the screen infinity war after credits scene dad's gonna open the door and be like what have you done and we have to keep going
[589:51.38]Why would you sit on a candlestick?
[589:53.34]What are you talking about?
[589:56.92]Sit on a candlestick and let it sparkle with light.
[590:02.34]From the smiles of everyone.
[590:05.59]Why are there other people here?
[590:07.25]Why are there a bunch of people watching me stick a candlestick?
[590:09.83]What?
[590:13.47]What's going on here?
[590:14.75]I missed that.
[590:20.64]I don't want to sit on a can- I'm skipping.
[590:32.27]That's translation for you.
[590:54.08]sit on a candle?
[590:54.84]I'm not sitting on a candlestick.
[590:58.09]No, stop this nonsense!
[591:00.23]Stop this!
[591:01.99]I'm putting the end here on this.
[591:04.91]I put the sandwich mama?
[591:07.27]Oh, no, no, that's the sandwich mama.
[591:08.95]There's gonna be a comma there.
[591:11.02]I put the sandwich mama.
[591:12.78]No, that would be the Christopher Walken.
[591:15.58]In one of my apron pockets as I head out.
[591:19.98]Even old magicians with grey hats and archdevils
[591:27.54]We'll do anything to get their items back.
[591:32.94]Thor!
[591:35.14]Don't do it, Thor.
[591:37.15]You're about to take the full brunt of a star.
[592:01.01]Like, don't, Thor, don't sit on the candle.
[592:35.04]He's insane.
[592:36.86]He's about to take the full brunt of a candlestick.
[592:44.67]Get it off the fucking screen!
[592:46.19]I'm sorry, I got it.
[592:50.47]Some of you guys are fucking crazy, I love it.
[592:58.35]Hey!
[592:58.81]Oh!
[592:58.91]Shh!
[592:59.01]Shh!
[592:59.61]Shh!
[593:00.55]Hey, Tira.
[593:01.01]You haven't forgotten anything, have you?
[593:04.23]I have not.
[593:04.65]I did not arrive with all that much, so... Oh, right.
[593:08.97]Well, then I... I know.
[593:13.07]Thank you, Tira.
[593:15.24]Farewell, Racine.
[593:16.20]Be the best shopkeeper you possibly can be.
[593:21.92]Tira.
[593:24.12]What?
[593:25.92]Something inside the barrel.
[593:28.10]It's gonna be Dad.
[593:29.30]These are ledgers.
[593:30.86]What are they for?
[593:35.30]Those, yeah, you see, um... Stock books, financial statements, profit reports.
[593:43.75]Asset ledgers, accounts payable and receivable.
[593:45.99]These.
[593:48.07]Uh... M-E-R-D-E.
[593:50.59]I said it over and over and over.
[593:52.59]Make sure to keep these books straight, receipt...
[593:55.32]They're all blank.
[593:57.42]Uh-oh.
[593:59.76]I was totally gonna do them right.
[594:02.36]But why do today what you can do tomorrow, and then tomorrow, and, uh, well, I ended up not doing them at all.
[594:06.84]Ihi.
[594:09.24]I do not have any excuses.
[594:10.30]Uh...
[594:21.94]Peter Tinklage.
[594:23.32]Fucking scene.
[594:24.98]It's like, I... Well, we need to go back, take inventory, and make sure nobody's plundering our account.
[594:37.01]Tear, what are you?
[594:40.01]Well, it's perfectly clear that if I leave you here alone, you would end up crushed like an insect the moment I leave.
[594:46.03]I intend to keep you working just as hard, mind you.
[594:55.79]Let's go back.
[594:59.16]Oh my god.
[595:00.04]And so, our days of running an item shop continued.
[595:09.75]Oh, I got the... true card?
[595:13.03]What are we doing?
[595:15.03]So you managed to pay off the loan shark fairy's debt, have you?
[595:18.33]Well, I suppose some congratulations are in order.
[595:21.46]Still, I would expect any common proletarian to have the holy basic skills needed to get this far.
[595:29.18]And now for part two.
[595:30.65]The elegant, graceful tale of Alouette.
[595:35.67]Shh, shh, yeah.
[595:37.07]Like EGS was interested in making that happen.
[595:41.23]What did you just say?
[595:42.79]Calm down, Missy.
[595:43.33]You don't need to get this worked up over it.
[595:44.69]More importantly, please just do the explanation right.
[595:46.59]Here's this one.
[595:50.63]I don't see why, of all the people, have to.
[595:52.79]Look here, Missis.
[595:55.23]Fine, fine, fine, if I must.
[595:56.23]Okay.
[595:57.53]Well then, without further ado, allow me to explain post-game content.
[596:02.62]Or enjoying the game after beating it.
[596:04.02]Alright, that's better.
[596:06.68]To start with, if you load the game you're about to save, you will begin endless mode where you can play as long as you like without having to worry about any debts.
[596:14.09]It may work as a common shopkeeper to your heart's delight.
[596:20.73]And you know, there just might, maybe possibly be some items and dungeons and stuff that you haven't seen before.
[596:26.45]In addition, you have now unlocked New Game Plus and the survival mode.
[596:31.01]You start over again in New Game Plus, but you choose a save and keep all the items and levels from that save.
[596:36.41]Remember that you gotta pay off the debt from the beginning again, though.
[596:39.45]Survival mode is a nasty business where you keep paying back debt every single week until it overwhelms you.
[596:45.03]How long can you last against weeks of six-digit payments, I wonder?
[596:49.81]Especially in that ridiculous survival hell mode.
[596:53.73]You might have picked up a true card from an adventurer.
[596:56.47]You only get that from an adventurer you're really close to, but if you have that, you can hire them from the start in these new modes.
[597:05.38]Okay.
[597:05.64]Let's go.
[597:05.86]Let's just make a new save.
[597:06.84]Okay.
[597:06.94]Save.
[597:33.84]Okay.
[597:40.02]How many do... Overwrite.
[597:42.59]No.
[597:43.33]How do I get out of this?
[597:45.39]I made it.
[597:46.41]Okay.
[598:02.19]Well, that's a lot.
[598:02.95]Item, let me see.
[598:03.59]Item encyclopedia.
[598:04.47]Cool, I got all the swords.
[598:06.17]All the daggers.
[598:07.27]All the staves.
[598:08.53]All the bows.
[598:09.89]All the spears.
[598:10.67]All the gloves.
[598:11.89]Ooh, these are, who knows, but these are... 29% completion rate.
[598:16.45]Oh my god.
[598:21.56]And then we are almost at exactly 10 hours.
[598:26.96]Fucking Thor.
[598:37.32]Well, that's gonna be it.
[598:39.62]That was a lot of fun.
[598:42.96]Candlestick, no.
[598:55.59]Thor, the candle.
[598:59.55]I don't want to sit on it.
[599:00.93]I'm not, I'm done with talking about, I'm never gonna, I'm not even gonna light, I'm never gonna talk about, I'm not gonna say the word ever again.
[599:26.24]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[599:29.20]We have bits to go through, but not very much.
[599:31.90]I'm going to go through these very quickly.
[599:37.55]Thank you.
[599:38.01]If you just stuck around, if you're just getting here, I mean, it's very late.
[599:41.85]I'm not going to be live tomorrow.
[599:44.11]And I have some things to do with the Carnival stream.
[599:47.95]So you will see me again.
[599:49.41]You'll see my face again on Thursday.
[599:53.66]so I got some work to do I'll see you guys in a couple days give him fits so he can't leave uh but I'm gonna I'm going through these quick so there's gonna be some progress done on the carnival stream so this just got so much louder for some reason why is it so loud
[600:20.92]Yeah, quit the game.
[600:21.98]What just happened?
[600:23.62]Did I quit out of everything?
[600:24.86]No.
[600:25.02]Alright, let's do these bits.
[600:30.55]Let's scroll back.
[600:32.27]Remember, I'm going to do these rapid fire.
[600:33.73]You're going to see them rapidly.
[600:36.15]We had UCI Kick.
[600:40.83]Hey, Jerma, I have a vid that I made with one of your Sims vids.
[600:46.18]I know that you're not much of a JoJo fan.
[600:54.91]But some of the chat members might get a kick out of it.
[600:56.83]Let me take a look at this.
[601:00.92]We're going quick here.
[601:02.34]Hold on.
[601:02.64]This is like an Adam Sandler video.
[601:07.09]Let's see.
[601:18.13]That's what it is so I can't show my computer's broken I can't put it on
[601:47.95]Guys, my controller is broken.
[601:49.01]I can't put it on.
[601:50.07]It's just the scene.
[601:51.39]Part 1 of the 69.
[601:54.49]It's too long.
[601:56.80]The 69 parts here.
[601:57.84]There you go.
[602:06.36]The Jerma lied about bits.
[602:09.34]Well, he said, I'm not much of a JoJo fan, but some of the people in chat might like it, so that's why I linked it.
[602:16.38]But thank you, UC, for the $5.
[602:17.96]And that was the Dio- Dio Volo versus JoJo.
[602:22.29]I don't even know if I should say that out loud, because that might be- I don't know what that is.
[602:26.13]Get the mouse cursor off screen, right?
[602:28.11]I don't know.
[602:34.39]It's a JoJo.
[602:36.58]Oh my god, Teyon, thanks for the $2.50.
[602:37.98]Just take my money, greedy streamer.
[602:39.16]Please don't hurt me.
[602:40.28]I'm not- Thank you for the $2.50.

[602:48.32]I teach so that hopefully the world doesn't continue to turn out selfish little maggots.
[602:55.02]Thanks for the streams.

[603:33.96]Please contact us for any further sponsorship deals.
[603:36.21]If I took a $5 sponsorship, that would be, like, embarrassing.
[603:44.60]five dollars that's what I'm worth that is less than what it costs for one of their ice creams so I would at least want one large ice cream but thank you uh gnarly the absolute not real bit message here thanks for the five bucks
[604:08.97]S10W update, thanks for the 250.
[604:10.81]Hey, how's it going, Jerma?
[604:12.89]Also known as Jerma985 on the video platforms such as Twitch and YouTube.
[604:15.67]It's me, slow update.
[604:17.67]Oh, it's not S10W update.
[604:20.69]It's slow update.
[604:22.05]Back at it again to say that this stream really resonates with me.
[604:24.87]As I'm also in debt with the mafia and they're going to break my fingers.
[604:27.97]Anyways, peace and love.
[604:29.13]Good luck with life.
[604:29.97]Good luck with that.

[604:50.92]What did you find?
[604:51.46]I found it.
[604:56.70]You found it.
[604:57.22]You did find it.
[604:58.24]Yes, you did.
[604:59.40]Everyone thought I was insane.

[606:44.57]jermaSaturn, thank you.
[606:47.75]Midveed, thanks for the $15.
[606:48.81]$15 from Midveed.
[606:54.64]Seriously, thanks a lot for your streams, dog.
[606:57.24]Been going through a really stressful week.
[606:59.10]This has been putting my mind at ease.
[607:01.70]Pleasure's all over here.
[607:03.54]Thank you for coming out here.
[607:05.71]Thanks for the $15.
[607:07.57]Hopefully your week gets better.
[607:09.87]Well, hopefully, because, I mean, it's Sunday, right?
[607:11.49]Technically Monday.
[607:13.27]Hopefully this new week is better for you.
[607:16.25]Thank you so much for the $15.
[607:17.83]Much love to you.
[607:19.73]Thanks a lot.
[607:21.45]Take care of yourself.
[607:25.25]I don't see why not.
[607:25.87]Probably.
[607:26.17]Not tomorrow, not the next day.
[607:27.21]Probably, though.
[607:27.77]On legendary mode.
[607:28.85]Just kidding.
[607:29.79]Delete that.
[607:30.49]They happen sometimes.
[607:51.14]I do a 10, 9 to 10 hour stream.
[607:57.13]Once every month or so.
[607:59.13]Once every couple dozen streams, I usually go for at least like 8 hours.
[608:03.57]I'm not even intentional either, it just kind of happens.
[608:05.21]I thank you, uh, DemonsBeat.
[608:10.89]Gunther Huitlinger, thanks for the five dollars.
[608:13.49]Hey Jerma, just recently got a piano and have so far taught myself the Paddy's Pub theme from Always Sunny and your song by Elton John.
[608:22.13]Tell me which song I should learn next and I'll do it.
[608:24.91]P.S.
[608:25.19]I'm almost at the 5,000 bit mark.
[608:27.01]Thank you for that.
[608:28.47]The next song you should learn is Beethoven's Second Symphony.
[608:36.05]Thank you for the five dollars.
[608:44.74]Good luck.
[608:52.24]Oh, no.
[608:53.32]You've doomed them.
[608:56.96]Thank you for the five dollars.
[608:58.24]Grouts on the piano.
[608:59.08]Pianos are cool, but they're just huge.
[609:02.31]Having a piano, in my opinion, is like having a pool.
[609:05.97]It's big.
[609:06.49]It just gets in the way.
[609:09.39]And nobody wants to clean it.
[609:10.43]It's like having a car in your living room.
[609:18.04]It's a big music pool.
[609:24.13]They are really cool, though.
[609:24.95]Especially some of the really nice ones.
[609:30.35]Again, thank you, Joel.
[609:31.49]Joel came in with a raid a few hours ago.
[609:34.31]We were getting to the end there.
[609:36.66]Thank you so much, Joel.
[609:38.50]Anybody that's still here from Joel's channel, thanks for staying up late.
[609:46.34]Or getting up early.
[609:49.86]Well... Open surprise eggs.
[610:20.10]corner that market completely.
[610:29.72]You know how much those YouTube videos make?
[610:33.00]People opening up surprise eggs with Spider-Man in them shit?
[610:35.50]Just do it on stream.
[610:48.19]But, thank you, Glopsy, for the $5.25.
[610:49.75]You can probably get that done in 30 minutes.
[610:58.87]Let's get the credits rolling.
[611:02.33]This is a long one, so I'm assuming there's going to be a long list.
[611:05.47]Let me take a look and see just how many.
[611:10.24]This is going to be fairly quick.
[611:12.10]This is going to be fairly quick.
[611:18.88]It's gonna be fairly quick.
[611:19.66]It's gonna be pretty good.
[611:20.66]Yeah, pretty normal.
[611:21.72]Pretty fairly quick.
[611:24.55]Still have a little bit more to go.
[611:28.11]We have... Uh, thank you... Thank you, Nay, for the five dollars.
[611:33.59]Not to be confused with... Wreckateer.
[611:37.01]Which is pronounced Wreck-a-teer as opposed to Wreck-a-teer like the first Wreckateer.
[611:42.90]You lost me.
[611:43.92]But thank you for the five dollars.
[611:45.50]Cyclops...
[611:47.13]Gave $50 earlier as well.
[611:48.77]Thank you, Cyclops.
[611:49.91]We caught it, but I want to catch it again.
[611:51.19]Because it was the last one that really came through here.
[611:57.11]Demons V, thanks for the $4.
[611:58.81]Please stream more.
[611:59.59]You distract me from the pain.
[612:04.93]Hopefully that is a joke.
[612:06.45]If it's not, then I'm sorry to hear that you're going through something.
[612:09.63]Please use the necessary resources you can find to get on top of that.
[612:19.43]But thank you for the $4 and take care of yourself.
[612:22.58]You're the most important person in your damn universe.
[612:24.40]Take care of you.
[612:27.08]As well as you can.
[612:37.40]Wiki this.
[612:38.00]Thanks for the $5.
[612:40.12]Candlestick.
[612:43.72]I mean, like, give me a break.
[612:44.82]I look down and it's talking about how I'm like, oh, and I...
[612:48.61]So people are like smiling I have a candle and I'm sitting on like I'm talking about me That was me sitting there and now he caught me all fired up again And then somebody said Thor and then Thor has it and then that's look I got a 10-hour stream here
[613:21.93]Jack be nimble, Jack be quick.
[613:26.55]Mario Ground Pound.
[613:28.29]I don't know why that came out.
[613:31.37]Alright.
[613:32.50]It's been fun.
[613:33.58]I'll see you guys in a couple days.
[613:40.38]Have a wonderful rest of your evening.
[613:43.00]Or your morning.
[613:43.56]Good morning.
[613:45.13]Those of you that just woke up.
[613:52.98]Uh, Connor.
[613:53.64]Thank you, Connor, for the $10.
[613:54.94]Connor Q. Jerma, I'm gonna need you to sit on that candle stick, please.
[613:59.30]It's important.
[613:59.94]Yep.
[614:00.12]Mm-hmm.
[614:02.15]Thank you.
[614:02.89]Thank you, Clueless Sniper, for the $2.50.
[614:04.47]Hey, Jerma, last stream you said you would do a Vianime voice.
[614:07.31]If you don't do it today, I'll be mildly disappointed.
[614:10.51]Boo.
[614:13.48]Thank you, uh, Spicy Pepe, for the $2.50.
[614:15.48]Hey, Jerma, today's stream was very fun.
[614:20.88]Um...
[614:42.67]Next week, because I'll be off to, well, not next week.
[614:45.87]It is next week already.
[614:47.13]Thursday, I'm probably going to do Thursday, Friday.
[614:50.15]Or Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[614:53.95]We'll see.
[614:54.51]I'm going to do two days in a row, three days in a row.
[614:57.69]Because of the carnival thing, what I'm trying to do is do like two days, two days, two days, two days, like two days, three days, three days, two days.
[615:09.45]We'll probably go back to...
[615:19.00]No, I'm saying like two days on two days off. Like three days, three days, two days, two days, two days on, two days off, two days on, two days off, two days on, three days off, three days off, three days on.
[615:27.00]No no not six days off. Not six days off in a row. Not: three days off, three days off, three days off. I mean I wouldn't be here for like two weeks.
[615:36.21]You know what I'm talking about.
[615:37.81]Look, I gotta eat food, okay?
[615:39.45]I haven't eaten, it's been like ten and a half hours.
[615:42.20]Sam and Max is probably gonna come back next weekend.
[615:47.04]Maybe like on Saturday we'll start season three.
[615:55.72]But for Thursday and Friday, or Friday or Thursday, whatever it is, I'm not so sure.
[616:02.30]I know I have like a kind of a backlog of things that I want to try.
[616:08.31]But I can't wait for the Condorless Dream either.
[616:10.61]It should be a lot of fun.
[616:13.83]Ever since kind of announcing it and talking about it a little bit, I've since wanted to kind of reel it in.
[616:18.26]Because I'd rather really start talking about it when there's dates involved and when there's actual tangible things to talk about.
[616:24.92]So, you know.
[616:32.57]What are we linking here?
[616:35.19]Oh, this is me doing the anime voice.
[616:37.11]You said you would do the anime voice.
[616:38.97]If you don't do it today, I'll be mildly disappointed.
[616:40.85]That's pretty good.
[616:49.35]Alright, I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[616:51.71]Thank you for joining me.
[616:54.46]Take care, everybody.
[616:56.48]I will do the stream legends because it's been enough time.
[617:01.62]That game's a lot of fun.
[617:02.74]I very much enjoyed that the last two days.
[617:06.90]Did not think I was going to play that game for like 19 hours, but I did.
[617:15.81]See you guys on Thursday.
[617:16.59]Have a great beginning of your week.
[617:26.31]And that game's also, I believe, on sale for like $4 or $5 right now, so...
[617:31.34]This seems to be a lot of content.
[617:36.55]Here comes the... Where is it here?
[617:43.00]Stream Legends, if you have it open.
[617:45.98]There it goes.
[617:49.08]Take care, guys.
[617:49.58]See you soon.
[617:52.11]Ta-ta.
[618:18.72]you
