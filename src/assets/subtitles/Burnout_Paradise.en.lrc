[02:19.18]Next game.
[02:20.02]This is the next.
[02:20.72]Oh, good thing.
[02:21.36]This actually has my, like, private fucking personal email on screen right now.
[02:31.67]Did that register a new EA account?
[02:33.39]Oh, go fuck yourself.
[02:36.57]I don't know what my password is for my EA account.
[02:40.78]Holy shit.
[02:49.57]This music is going to drive me crazy.
[02:51.83]I have no idea what it is.
[02:52.81]I'm just going to skip it.
[02:54.15]I have no fucking idea.
[02:55.19]Alright, let's go.
[03:03.24]Okay.
[03:11.31]Hey, Paradise City, start a party!
[03:17.36]Welcome to Paradise City, the home of burnout driving.
[03:24.26]Bigwow at AOL.com.
[03:27.50]To the grid network of downtown Paradise.
[03:30.88]The city has miles of open road.
[03:34.33]Explore everything at your leisure.
[03:36.67]So this is remastered.
[03:42.94]What did they change?
[03:44.65]Every road in Paradise City is a challenge.
[03:47.35]Every road is a challenge?
[03:48.13]I don't really ever put much time in Paradise.
[03:51.52]When you want some real action, pull up at the traffic lights and spin your wheels.
[03:57.55]every intersection is a new adventure okay events in Paradise city finish at one of eight locations okay one for each point of the compass north of the city is the country okay the coast guard hq in the northeast the waterfront plaza on the east coast in the southeast you need to picture my driver's license before I can stream this game okay yeah front and back too in the south bay
[04:25.13]Lone Stallion Ranch, southwest of the city.
[04:28.56]The Wind Farm in the West Hills.
[04:31.40]And in the Northwest Mountains.
[04:33.16]Alright, I get you.
[04:34.52]I got it.
[04:36.38]As a newcomer to the city, you've been given a learner's permit.
[04:40.20]I do get a license.
[04:43.07]When you win enough, we'll upgrade your license and give you a new car.
[04:47.70]The world is full of surprises.
[04:50.86]We'll keep you updated as you drive.
[04:52.74]It might just be the cutscene.
[04:54.52]What happens next is completely up to you.
[04:59.14]Alright.
[05:00.98]Let's do it.
[05:02.34]I'm ready.
[05:04.34]I'm excited for this remastered video game.
[05:06.16]This is Crash FM, and I'm DJ Atomica, fresh from Radio Big to be your guide to the streets of Paradise City.
[05:14.11]First thing we need is a picture for your learner's permit.
[05:16.41]Picture.
[05:19.01]This will have to do for now.
[05:20.71]If you had a USB camera connected, we could have used something more personal.
[05:24.08]I do!
[05:24.28]I do!
[05:24.50]I do!
[05:26.10]I do!
[05:26.38]Oh, I do.
[05:26.74]I actually do.
[05:28.06]I do!
[05:34.54]I can't.
[05:35.26]This learner's permit lets you drive anywhere in Paradise City.
[05:38.87]The best drivers have a burnout driver's license, but you've got a lot to prove before you can earn one of those.
[05:43.27]I'll have to do it later.
[05:46.65]Now let's go to the junkyard to fix you up with a set of wheels.
[05:50.82]The junkyard?
[05:51.20]Why the junkyard first?
[05:52.52]That thing sucks.
[05:54.36]This hunter cavalry is all we have for you today.
[05:57.02]It's a stunt class car, which means it's built for jumps and spins.
[05:59.74]Somebody smashed it with a hammer a bunch of times.
[06:02.08]Perfect for anyone coming like you.
[06:09.20]Now, this car is a little beat up, so it'd be a good idea to find an auto repair shop and get it fixed before you get into any serious action.
[06:17.12]We've marked the nearest one on your map here.
[06:19.70]It's just around the corner on Angus Wharf.
[06:22.53]Okay, let's just check this thing still starts.
[06:25.41]Hold the accelerator to fire up the engine.
[06:29.31]There it is.
[06:30.65]Alright.
[06:31.79]Ooh, I like the way this... I like the way... I like the mouthfeel on this one, you know?
[06:35.23]I'm going to go to repair shop.
[06:40.69]Um, hold on.
[06:43.45]Drive, phone.
[06:44.87]How can I... Records, discovery.
[06:50.70]Save, load options.
[06:52.72]Screen brightness options.
[06:55.36]I want to see if I can...
[06:58.04]Share usage data.
[06:58.96]Don't spy on me, EA.
[07:04.85]Can I put the thing on?
[07:06.31]No, it's alright.
[07:09.73]No, just go back.
[07:11.74]Here we go.
[07:12.46]Let's get the tutorial done.
[07:14.88]Road rage.
[07:16.70]What did I just do?
[07:19.08]Road rage battle across town against the other drivers beat the takedown target before time runs out I need to repair the car to receive a mark on your license.
[07:28.27]What?
[07:28.51]I have to fight these people?
[07:30.33]They only have one song in this game I'm trying to figure out what does what Okay, then he boosts his axe
[07:50.57]Got a takedown, right?
[07:56.05]I have no control right now.
[08:06.25]Okay.
[08:07.43]I dropped directly into that.
[08:09.53]That's a double takedown, I would say, if I was me.
[08:13.31]Too many crashes in a road rage or marked man event will destroy your car.
[08:17.62]Use auto repair shops to keep the action going.
[08:20.06]I need to- no.
[08:21.08]I need to go fucking get my car repaired.
[08:24.90]Am I wasting money?
[08:26.36]Hey, let me actually try to get this guy.
[08:32.53]Wrecked, right?
[08:35.17]I'll get this guy right here.
[08:41.47]That's not a takedown?
[08:46.74]How are these not takedowns?
[08:47.90]There they go.
[08:49.62]Smash another driver off the road to score a takedown and pick up a boost bonus.
[08:53.88]Boost bonus.
[08:55.56]Let's get the twitch.tv car.
[09:00.92]Got it.
[09:03.06]I won, right?
[09:04.66]Target T. I guess we just keep going for a little bit.
[09:11.25]Jesus Christ.
[09:12.15]Okay, got that guy.
[09:16.51]That's another one.
[09:17.07]That's four in a row.
[09:19.06]Gonna get a penta kill.
[09:22.36]Gonna get the penta?
[09:22.94]Got it.
[09:27.16]Penta.
[09:28.08]Oh.
[09:34.51]The tactic here, man, is you just get in everybody's way.
[09:36.93]Just get in the middle of the road.
[09:38.07]Just turn the car out.
[09:39.07]Burn it out.
[09:39.67]Just like the title of the game.
[09:43.53]I need to go repair the car.
[09:53.86]Event wins are shown on your driver's license.
[09:56.32]Keep up your winning streak to advance to the next license.
[10:00.10]okay upgrade in one win I get a new license now let's go actually do the game hit the e-brake to spin your car great if you miss a turn but there's plenty more you can do with it I think that actually only is one song this is the song on repeat forever until you turn it off the screen shows your surroundings and the signs at the top of it and it's just the chorus you're on and the turns coming up it's only the chorus
[10:32.33]I need to go to the actual repair shop
[11:02.44]They wanted to get you hyped up for this.
[11:03.86]Yeah, they do.
[11:04.40]This is fun.
[11:05.86]I need to take a right here.
[11:21.55]Can I jump out of the car?
[11:24.27]No, it's not that.
[11:31.23]This game's gonna be fun.
[11:32.22]Jump.
[11:32.34]Construction jump!
[11:32.92]Oh, that's cool.
[11:33.50]Okay.
[11:33.66]I didn't do it right, but that's cool.
[11:35.78]This is giving me anxiety.
[11:37.94]I don't like going this fast in a GTA.
[11:59.30]You're ready for a burning route created just for this car.
[12:02.82]Beat the time and win an upgraded model of your current ride.
[12:06.76]Okay.
[12:07.54]No, wait.
[12:08.91]No, let... I'm gonna do it.
[12:11.17]I'm gonna go back and do this.
[12:13.99]Beat the route.
[12:17.37]Get over here.
[12:19.89]Start it.
[12:20.17]Why would I prepare this one when I get a free one?
[12:22.09]Ready for a burning route?
[12:24.11]You are here.
[12:25.63]Race south to the Wildcats Baseball Stadium.
[12:28.36]Beat the target time to get a mark on your license and a special reward.
[12:32.06]Interesting.
[12:32.78]Okay.
[12:33.90]Where do I have to go?
[12:35.18]This way.
[12:41.63]Okay, I've got a minute and 40 seconds to do this.
[12:48.03]It's great The compass at the top of the screen points to the finish line and the road signs help you find the next turn any Shortcuts you'll have to find for yourself.
[12:57.04]It's the road signs This way I'll get it shortcut in a shortcut.
[13:05.30]Yep.
[13:05.42]Oh
[13:12.36]Oh, fuck.
[13:15.36]Jesus Christ.
[13:16.30]Okay, we're good.
[13:19.50]Made it.
[13:20.36]Ample time.
[13:22.94]Do I have to jump over this or something?
[13:32.48]Yeah, that was fun.
[13:41.49]Put on Avril Lavigne.
[13:46.84]Congratulations.
[13:48.12]That win was all you needed to upgrade your license to a Class D. All your wins have been cleared off the map, so you can beat an event again and add that win to your new license.
[13:56.93]Fix the car?
[13:57.65]Oh, I just got a new car.
[13:58.69]Why repair a car when you can just get a free car?
[14:00.07]When you win a burning route, you get a hotter version of the car you were driving.
[14:04.15]They're delivered straight to the junkyard, so head over there and take your new ride for a test drive.
[14:10.21]celebrate upgrading your license with a new car the hunter mesquite has been delivered to the junkyard interesting I do think I actually have to do this thing I think I have to actually repair the car to continue the story so is anybody that played the original game seeing a difference to the remaster or is it just tighter visuals or upgraded resolution or something
[14:43.13]You don't have to repair?
[14:49.06]I want to do it just to see it.
[14:53.12]No difference.
[14:57.58]The same thing.
[15:00.64]Haven't seen a difference yet, really.
[15:08.62]When you feel like a fast color change, drive through a paint shop.
[15:11.56]Finding a drive-through for the first time adds it to your map.
[15:16.57]It's 1080p with some minor visual improvements, really nothing added.
[15:23.01]so what uh why did they why did they make this is there a reason for them to make this didn't burn out Paradise just come out not that long ago when you take a wreck through an auto repair for the first time the burning route for that car is added to your map let's go get the new car
[15:47.28]So do we just- is this- is it just ride around and just do a bunch of shit?
[15:50.78]Alright, is the junk- not the junkyard, where's the- where's like the garage?
[15:57.18]Is there a way I can- Here's like the junkyard, but where's my actual garage?
[16:06.59]Build up your collection of cars, then find a junkyard like this one to switch your ride.
[16:10.93]There are five junkyards to find in Paradise city.
[16:13.04]You wanna be off by a few years?
[16:16.36]Well, I definitely want the motorcycle.
[16:17.68]Please give that to me.
[16:18.42]Do I have to pay for this?
[16:20.07]I'll do it.
[16:20.35]I'll put my credit card off.
[16:21.67]I'll turn the camera off.
[16:24.89]Yeah, give it to me.
[16:29.99]Yep.
[16:37.01]Get the bike.
[16:37.49]It's free.
[16:37.97]Thank God.
[16:39.19]Oh, it's mine.
[16:45.79]Jesus.
[16:50.12]Take the picture?
[16:51.70]Well, let me see if I'm gonna even play it for a while.
[16:56.90]There's the mosquito.
[17:06.19]You can't fall off motorcycles, it just cuts to a black screen.
[17:09.11]Aww.
[17:10.29]That's too bad.
[17:11.01]Do I have any toys?
[17:18.62]Look at this thing.
[17:21.24]What?
[17:21.78]Wow.
[17:24.12]What about this goofy thing?
[17:25.28]Toy Manhattan?
[17:30.52]I kind of need to get into the stupid... Yes.
[17:35.71]I would like to use this place.
[17:42.48]This is an aggression class car.
[17:44.72]Slamming and taking down other racers earns boost faster in this car, and you can use it at any time.
[17:49.74]It's a micro machine!
[17:51.93]Oh boy, this is hard to control.
[17:57.45]It really is a clown car, it is.
[17:59.41]Alright, so where we go?
[18:00.09]We got some stuff to do over here?
[18:06.08]Why am I doing a race with this car?
[18:08.26]Ready to race?
[18:09.81]You are here.
[18:11.29]Race south to the Wildcats Baseball Stadium.
[18:16.96]Who's in the race?
[18:17.60]Oh, this guy.
[18:19.56]Oh, it's other toys.
[18:22.10]It's just Twisted Metal.
[18:30.06]Takedowns earn a chunk of boost when you're driving.
[18:32.46]I'm just driving around as Koopa.
[18:33.82]But you'll lose a chunk if you're taken down.
[18:38.14]I always play as Donkey Kong.
[18:39.11]You'll do that to Toad every time.
[18:40.25]I win.
[18:43.87]There we go.
[18:56.18]I finished first place.
[18:57.04]I'll take another license, please.
[19:01.79]Six more wins.
[19:04.83]Oh, I turned my mic down accidentally.
[19:07.57]Whoops.
[19:07.73]Yeah, I turned off my mic slightly.
[19:08.79]Anything else I should do with the toy car?
[19:10.19]Oops.
[19:32.87]Sorry.
[19:35.33]I just got bowling balled into that guy's windshield.
[19:42.03]Alright, cool.
[19:42.61]Let's go up here.
[19:46.93]When you see another driver, take him down to win his car.
[19:49.61]Another driver?
[19:50.29]This guy right here?
[19:55.81]I'll get him.
[19:58.57]You're dealing with a bulldozer right now, man.
[20:03.38]Here we go.
[20:06.33]Oh, that was close.
[20:07.57]Come on, go, go, go.
[20:12.53]Should have had that.
[20:13.07]If I wasn't in a fucking RC car, I would have got him.
[20:25.84]There we go.
[20:28.24]Is he going straight?
[20:29.84]Okay.
[20:30.00]Okay.
[20:36.17]I still didn't do it?
[20:38.15]What?
[20:38.33]Where'd he go?
[20:38.73]Oh, he's behind me.
[20:46.12]Dick.
[20:56.99]Got it.
[20:57.21]I got the slammer.
[20:57.87]Cool.
[20:58.11]Alright, I'm happy about that.
[20:58.97]I'm gonna go up here.
[20:59.53]Smash it.
[20:59.95]That didn't crash.
[21:00.53]Come on.
[21:33.23]Hey, remember the annoying sound?
[21:34.21]The drill?
[21:34.67]Did it get repaired?
[21:41.81]Alright, it repaired itself.
[21:42.97]Good.
[21:49.99]Car fixed.
[21:52.97]Alright, I want to find something else to do.
[22:03.47]Every intersection seems to have something to do.
[22:05.05]Stunt run.
[22:05.51]I want to do it.
[22:08.35]Ready for a stunt run?
[22:09.95]Use boost and drifts to combo together the most outrageous jumps, rolls, and spins to beat the target score inside the time limit.
[22:17.50]I have to peel out?
[22:25.78]Oh, wow.
[22:26.16]So badass.
[22:29.64]No, no, no, no, no.
[22:30.66]Excuse me.
[22:32.65]Excuse me, let's go off-road.
[22:38.63]Come on, get up!
[22:39.97]Go!
[22:41.61]Stop it.
[22:42.33]Am I going to get points for this?
[22:49.20]There we are.
[22:49.64]Alright, boost.
[22:51.24]I need 5,000 points.
[22:51.98]Here we go.
[22:58.71]I just grinded that rail too.
[22:59.85]Are you kidding me?
[23:00.73]Are you fucking kidding me?
[23:01.33]Are you kidding me?
[23:02.13]Everyone wants to make fun of me now?
[23:03.15]6500 times 3 with a little triple Lutz.
[23:15.46]Reversing gives me extra points.
[23:22.01]I'll take it.
[23:22.41]I still have a minute.
[23:29.70]Whoa, burnout.
[23:30.44]I need another x3.
[23:31.10]Can I do like a backflip or something?
[23:38.98]E-brake turn.
[23:40.11]Let's get through here.
[23:41.51]I'm gonna smash the sign.
[23:52.07]I beat it already.
[23:55.63]Oh god, please change cars.
[23:59.09]I will after this, don't worry.
[24:00.39]This is just a joke for the very beginning of the game.
[24:13.32]We're fine.
[24:13.72]41,000 points, I'll take it.
[24:20.91]Don't worry a lot, we just win everything we do.
[24:26.67]Almost got my license.
[24:31.80]Let's go get a new car.
[24:32.83]I want to try the car that I just unlocked.
[24:35.01]Ready for a new burnout challenge?
[24:36.97]Every road has a showtime and a time road rule to beat.
[24:40.33]Use the easy drive menu or press the up button to switch different road rules on and off.
[24:44.89]Let's go back to the garage.
[24:51.20]You guys don't like the RC car sounds?
[24:52.60]I love the RC car.
[25:04.38]Thank God this thing is indestructible.
[25:14.54]Now we got Jane's Addiction.
[25:17.84]Alright, Junkyard.
[25:21.44]Let's change that.
[25:26.86]Blue Bee Shakes, homemade fresh milkshakes.
[25:30.62]What do we got?
[25:33.93]Hmm.
[25:35.39]Okay, let's speed on this thing.
[25:38.21]Is it good?
[25:44.78]Don't use the DLC cards.
[25:47.38]I want to try one of the bikes.
[25:48.42]Speed.
[25:49.86]There we go.
[25:50.82]I just want to try it.
[25:54.38]Drop it down here.
[25:55.00]Yeah, I want to try it.
[26:00.92]Motorcycle's the most fun.
[26:13.27]Turn it on.
[26:15.99]Now we got... This thing's a little bit different and hard to control.
[26:18.96]Strange.
[26:21.26]What's this?
[26:21.78]We got... Burning Ride.
[26:24.62]Let's try it.
[26:27.92]It's just a race, right?
[26:28.96]That's far away.
[26:30.58]Alright, straight ahead.
[26:31.45]Punch it.
[26:47.95]We can do like wheelies.
[26:50.93]That's awesome.
[26:51.45]Look at this.
[26:51.79]Look at the height.
[26:52.17]You ever seen a guy ride a wheelie this long?
[26:55.03]I haven't.
[26:58.31]Still going.
[26:58.87]Still up.
[26:59.93]It's still in the air.
[27:00.55]Are you fucking serious?
[27:07.16]I can't control it.
[27:08.42]I'm good.
[27:08.78]I'm fine.
[27:13.28]Is there no boost on these bikes?
[27:18.15]Holy God.
[27:19.01]Alright, we're fine.
[27:26.71]Where is it?
[27:27.05]Across?
[27:27.52]I gotta go across the way.
[27:28.48]Hold on.
[27:28.70]Across the way.
[27:33.36]Turn.
[27:33.60]I gotta go the other way.
[27:34.42]Fuck.
[27:39.20]It's this way.
[27:39.80]How do I open the map?
[27:41.74]Shit.
[27:42.26]Come on.
[27:42.94]Damn it!
[27:49.08]It's over here.
[27:49.78]I didn't know... It's still a chance.
[27:58.41]There's a slight chance.
[27:59.73]I missed the exit.
[28:00.81]It's over.
[28:01.27]I'm sorry.
[28:08.71]I'm laughing.
[28:09.57]I'm laughing too hard.
[28:13.28]Uh...
[28:20.56]Bumper.
[28:22.28]I need to do the bumper votes.
[28:24.78]Ay-yi-yi.
[28:26.52]It's alright.
[28:27.30]Bike's probably not for me.
[28:29.63]I don't know what to say.
[28:38.63]Ah, that's funny.
[28:40.47]Let's go.
[28:40.95]I'm gonna go across.
[28:46.12]Nope, look at this.
[28:49.84]Kinda cool.
[28:57.93]It's funny every time.
[28:59.85]I'm sorry, it just is.
[29:03.05]What is this one?
[29:06.59]Alright.
[29:07.94]I'll get this one.
[29:08.54]I'm not gonna fucking run.
[29:11.93]Jesus Christ.
[29:14.69]Okay, straight up.
[29:17.70]Go left of the fork.
[29:18.54]You got it.
[29:24.20]Straight up.
[29:26.54]And I'm going to dangle.
[29:27.58]That guy tried to hit me.
[29:29.66]That guy was out to get me.
[29:34.22]He turned into me.
[29:43.18]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29:43.78]Alright, let's do it.
[29:52.76]Stay left.
[29:54.89]Be careful.
[29:55.41]Slow down.
[29:55.81]Don't go that fast.
[30:01.33]Yeah, I may have drifted into his lane, but... Come on.
[30:05.77]You can't... He's driving too fast.
[30:07.18]Take a left-right arrow.
[30:11.90]I'm going to weave around this.
[30:13.40]I could go that way, but no, we're going to go the right way.
[30:15.00]I still got plenty of time.
[30:24.65]Big turn.
[30:29.60]Oh, boy.
[30:30.26]Alright, we're good.
[30:32.84]Almost there.
[30:33.26]Alright, he's up.
[30:34.90]I got plenty of time.
[30:43.48]And here we go.
[30:44.88]Success.
[30:49.82]I died.
[30:53.59]How many more?
[30:57.77]2% completion.
[31:01.50]Alright.
[31:03.72]RIP the whole burnout bot.
[31:04.98]Yeah, unfortunately.
[31:14.89]I want to get a really fast car.
[31:16.96]I can't do the bike.
[31:18.34]The bike is really fun to just drive around in, but... What's that?
[31:22.60]There was a cool opening there.
[31:28.50]Let's put on the first-person VR mode.
[31:36.42]I can't.
[31:39.46]I'm telling you, I can't control this.
[31:44.89]That was pretty cool.
[31:45.91]I died so many times.
[31:51.03]Puke, vision.
[31:51.61]Alright, let's get... I want to get another car.
[31:52.93]Is there another... There is.
[32:00.13]Midnight Ride.
[32:00.89]What's this?
[32:02.83]Wrong time of day.
[32:03.67]Come back between 8pm and 8am.
[32:04.93]Are you serious?
[32:12.57]Do first person again.
[32:13.69]Hold on.
[32:13.99]What's this?
[32:14.31]I can do this.
[32:16.05]No, no, no, no.
[32:16.53]Excuse me.
[32:17.41]I don't want to try that.
[32:22.73]I can't go down here?
[32:24.11]Why?
[32:26.81]What's this timer for?
[32:30.05]What's going on right now?
[32:36.93]I don't know what's going on, but this is a pod racing right now.
[32:53.75]So this is somebody's record I'm trying to beat?
[32:56.41]I guess it's on the mini-map?
[33:07.47]Let's get back down to society here.
[33:13.15]Still alive.
[33:14.55]Still alive.
[33:22.94]I am going way too fast.
[33:24.12]I need to come back to civilization.
[33:30.88]There we go, this is rough.
[33:40.07]I don't know what that... I don't know what I just did.
[33:41.43]I did something.
[33:41.89]Gonna bang a hard right here.
[33:45.35]I want to look at the other cars.
[33:50.79]Let me actually just take a look at them.
[33:59.75]This looks like some death plot.
[34:08.05]New car.
[34:09.00]Let's see.
[34:09.38]What do we got?
[34:12.56]Drive responsibly?
[34:13.46]I'm trying.
[34:15.08]I want to look at some more toys.
[34:17.14]These are intriguing.
[34:20.28]Oh, that's dumb.
[34:23.35]Back it up.
[34:27.35]Why is this thing so fast?
[34:33.28]Have to wait until it loads up?
[34:34.62]Yeah.
[34:36.73]Paradise bikes boost special cars.
[34:41.13]These are locked.
[34:43.15]I can't use these.
[34:45.25]What on Earth is that?
[34:48.44]Oh, but no.
[34:49.04]That's the boost type is locked.
[34:50.58]I'm going to try it.
[35:04.43]Holy shit this thing looks dangerous Okay, that's that's what it means it means you can't turn it off that's what locked means So you have to keep that on let's do a minute This is race
[35:30.24]Get ready to race.
[35:31.78]You are here.
[35:33.26]Race south to Lone Stallion Ranch.
[35:35.52]OK.
[35:39.22]Why did they get a head start?
[35:44.18]They have the same car as me.
[35:46.90]That's not fair.
[35:53.86]Oh my fucking god.
[35:55.30]I can't turn it off.
[35:57.08]That thing actually you don't want to have that on.
[35:59.74]And as he turns it on again.
[36:04.79]I will be so far ahead of everybody by this point.
[36:09.93]Oh man.
[36:11.65]Oh man.
[36:14.17]Whoa.
[36:18.37]Whoa!
[36:20.34]It's like Men in Black when they fly around in the highway.
[36:23.92]Holy shit.
[36:26.08]This is fucking Sonic the Hedgehog 2.
[36:29.74]I'm going the wrong way, man.
[36:33.38]How do I open the map?
[36:38.71]Holy Jesus Christ.
[36:40.27]I'm still- I'm only in-
[36:48.02]Here they come.
[36:48.36]Alright, I just gotta get in front of them.

[37:26.65]Oh, no, I gotta turn this off.
[37:27.55]We're getting big turns here.
[37:29.86]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[37:30.62]Turn it off.
[37:30.94]How do I turn the boost off?
[37:35.00]I get no more boost.
[37:36.58]Don't do it again.
[37:38.42]I don't even need it.
[37:39.66]I'll beat everybody right now.
[37:41.12]Just gotta be smart.
[37:47.59]That's a drift.
[37:48.23]Okay.
[37:52.76]Stay ahead.
[37:53.90]Good.
[37:55.94]No mistakes and I should be fine.
[37:57.74]This guy's right behind me though.
[37:59.97]I'm going to boost him this last turn.
[38:02.67]He's going right across the finish line.
[38:03.77]There we go.
[38:04.67]That's a win.
[38:14.44]This car seems to be faster than usual.
[38:15.76]I don't know.
[38:18.30]That's weird.

[39:23.00]Alright, now I have to play The Simpsons Hit and Run.
[39:26.60]There's another race there, I don't really want to do it.
[39:29.37]I want a regular car, not one of these cheater cars, you know?

[40:47.98]How did that just happen?
[40:51.37]You gotta be kidding me.

[41:03.52]Where is he?
[41:03.80]God damn it.
[41:09.78]Now we pass the garage.
[41:11.82]Oh well.
[41:15.16]I'm going so fast right now, I'm surprised I haven't seen anything.
[41:19.46]We gotta turn around.
[41:26.17]Let's do a stunt run.
[41:28.51]We're right here.
[41:30.05]10,000 points in two minutes.
[41:30.93]It's going to be so easy with this car.

[41:36.98]Ready?
[41:43.48]150 already.
[41:43.82]And here we go.
[41:56.79]That's a good stunt.

[41:59.61]I flipped the car upside down.
[42:05.45]See?
[42:05.75]700 points.
[42:05.99]No, over here.
[42:06.77]I need to jump.

[42:11.60]Train tracks.
[42:12.08]Is that a train?
[42:13.64]Need some big air.
[42:26.95]Big air.
[42:27.33]Multiplier times one.
[42:28.11]There it is.
[42:33.07]We got 3,000.
[42:33.53]3,000 times two.
[42:40.09]Yeah.
[42:40.55]I mean, that was fucking cool.
[42:42.26]I'll take another 3,000 over here.
[42:48.10]Boost it.
[42:56.43]Straight through the air, face, whatever the hell this is.
[43:02.53]Yeah, I got it.
[43:08.87]Oh, here it is!
[43:10.15]Somebody was waiting for the song to come on.
[43:11.37]Here it is.
[43:17.54]Fuck!
[43:18.48]Wait, does that destroy everything?
[43:20.38]Combo over.
[43:21.16]What does that mean?

[43:55.54]Come on, Avril.
[43:56.22]Pump yourself, why don't you?
[44:04.54]She says, fuck her.
[44:05.26]She says, fuck.
[44:19.20]It's alright, they're still going.
[44:28.83]This game is too much for me, man.
[44:30.29]I can't do it.
[44:37.78]Get up!
[44:40.68]Go!
[44:49.79]Keep going!
[44:55.88]Ah, that's a pretty good headstand.
[45:00.57]It sounds like I'm just playing this song off the internet.
[45:17.53]Okay, I gotta stop.
[45:18.67]I need a break from this.
[45:20.59]Wait, there's a car!
[45:22.57]Go get Homer Simpson's car, quick!
[45:26.61]Way to go!
[45:34.38]Oh, god damn it!
[45:38.72]I fucking can't do it.
[45:40.08]I need to get that car.
[45:46.53]He went this way, right?
[45:48.06]Come on!
[45:54.58]No!
[45:54.86]No!
[45:55.04]Please!
[45:56.08]Please!
[45:57.30]I need to get it!
[46:01.87]Oh, I'm gonna start crying.
[46:04.29]I'm just gonna wait for him.
[46:10.11]I don't even want to hear this song anymore either.
[46:15.96]Ugh.
[46:23.82]He's gonna come back.
[46:24.76]There it is.
[46:36.04]What?
[46:36.26]How did he get behind me?
[46:53.17]Damn it, man.
[46:53.61]Did he get behind me?
[47:02.41]I'm waiting for him again.
[47:09.14]Where is he?
[47:09.56]His random spawn will happen.
[47:15.12]This game is fucking fun.
[47:21.42]Is this another Avril Lavigne song?
[47:24.50]Oh, do you carry the torch for my young man?
[47:27.69]Do you believe in that thing?
[47:30.53]Do you carry it around just to burn things down?
[47:35.98]Music up, sound down.
[47:37.02]Alright, that's it.
[47:38.16]I don't think he's bummed.
[47:39.47]New car.
[47:40.03]Look at the songs playing out here.
[47:43.51]It's black.
[48:02.63]Marked man?
[48:03.47]I want to see this.
[48:07.37]Okay.
[48:07.79]Okay, escape.
[48:08.53]Oh, no.
[48:08.91]Oh, no.
[48:09.75]Okay.
[48:10.11]No boost here, I don't think.
[48:11.89]People are after me.
[48:13.29]As long as I don't crash.
[48:14.53]They're already here.
[48:15.35]There's already a guy here.
[48:16.61]There's like three people here.
[48:30.66]Is there I lost it's already over How have I not failed it
[48:59.92]I'm just going to drive the rules of the road.
[49:02.94]They're both insane.
[49:03.97]They'll crash themselves.
[49:06.81]I'm just going to go down an alleyway here.
[49:08.11]I don't think those... Yeah, they are actually.
[49:12.44]This guy's after them.
[49:17.08]Press the X button to boost.
[49:19.38]I'm not boosting right now, are you kidding me?
[49:28.35]How do you mind?
[49:29.87]Let's go across the bridge.
[49:36.18]Now I'll boost.
[49:36.68]This is a straightaway boost.
[49:38.60]Oh my god.
[49:56.09]Did I do it?
[49:56.55]I did it.
[49:57.99]Nice.
[50:04.50]Two more wins.
[50:04.94]Ooh.
[50:07.32]The Kruger.
[50:07.92]Alright.
[50:08.92]Does that mean I lost access to the home essential car?
[50:13.20]I still... I don't want to be doing boosts still.
[50:27.03]Let's get rid of the DLC car.
[50:32.88]I'm so overstimulated right now.
[50:35.44]I know.
[50:35.68]This game is an overstimulation.
[50:38.24]It's fun though.
[50:42.85]They don't really just don't fuck around.
[50:43.97]It's just kind of like, hey, here's a bunch of random shit to do.
[50:46.41]Just go drive around and do it.
[50:50.63]Legendary cars.
[50:53.01]The Ghostbusters Ghostbustmobile.
[50:56.33]Are you kidding me?
[51:01.33]Uh, yeah.
[51:06.18]You think I'm not gonna use Ecto-1?
[51:07.22]Are you kidding me?
[51:09.98]Is it the Ghostbusters theme song?
[51:13.40]Alright, is the Ghostbusters theme song in this game?
[51:20.76]If it is, we're gonna blast it.
[51:24.39]Soundtrack.

[52:03.16]Turn that off.
[52:04.22]No.
[52:13.80]Give me some other song we can dance to.
[52:22.85]They made these songs.
[52:27.24]I don't want to hear the song that you played.
[52:30.98]This is royalty-free music.
[52:33.32]Chicken George?
[52:37.76]Another World.
[52:44.89]Wow, that's bad.
[52:50.19]Give us something else.

[52:56.50]Nutcracker Ballet, yep.
[52:59.02]Carnival of the Animals.

[53:34.01]Yep.
[53:40.81]No.
[53:41.13]Terrible.
[53:44.97]Terrible.
[53:51.67]I can tell if up to the first five seconds I'm going to want it in the game.
[53:56.46]Okay, cool.
[54:01.94]I thought that was just the Universal Studios intro theme song.
[54:08.26]Listen.
[54:10.10]Alright, what about this?
[54:18.34]Nope.
[54:25.35]Yeah Okay good, so we have Avril Lavigne and classical music So randomly during the game you're gonna get Avril Lavigne in the middle of all this nonsense Let's make sure that's happening
[54:58.46]Okay.
[54:58.70]Yeah, we're good.
[55:01.38]Accept.
[55:03.37]Make sure the volume is correct.
[55:08.75]That sounds pretty good.
[55:10.95]Alright, let's go.
[55:15.78]What does a Ghostbusters car do?
[55:18.50]Decent boost.
[55:20.68]What is this, ammunition?
[55:26.12]There's the music!
[55:30.21]Where's the fucking music?
[55:31.16]We can't hear it!
[55:37.58]Annihilator burning route.
[55:40.76]Oh, I'm in the wrong car.
[55:50.97]Louder?
[55:51.53]I can't make it louder.
[55:56.07]Get out of the way!
[56:01.90]I'm in the Manhattan.
[56:03.34]Isn't this the Manhattan?
[56:12.48]Marked man.
[56:14.49]There we go.
[56:16.51]It's already crashed into 11.
[56:18.45]10 sound effects down?
[56:20.59]I already did.
[56:21.15]Well, I'll turn it up one or two more notches.
[56:34.51]There.
[56:35.97]Oh, now it's just gonna be music.
[56:38.39]But I just have to get away, right?
[56:43.35]Where's my music?
[56:45.19]There.
[56:49.99]Perfect.
[56:58.87]I thought that was a ramp.
[57:00.44]I thought that was a ramp going up.
[57:14.85]There's ghosts!
[57:23.29]This makes it actually easier to play with this music in the background.
[57:28.09]Is that strange to anybody?
[57:29.14]I feel like I'm an out-of-body experience.
[57:33.54]I'm not even controlling the game.
[57:34.64]It's just playing itself here.
[57:43.53]See what I mean?
[57:44.77]This is just fantastic.
[57:46.53]This sounds wonderful.
[57:53.55]I feel like this is the end of some kind of movie.
[57:58.98]I love movies.
[58:04.84]Oh, good.
[58:05.22]Yeah, I love movies.
[58:18.76]That's where it ends.
[58:24.26]Get out of the way.
[58:30.89]Ghostbusters 4.
[58:33.13]Yeah, that's how the movie ends.
[58:37.61]One win, and I get a new license.
[58:42.51]I don't mind this car.
[58:43.48]Here's another race.
[58:48.13]Yeah, so I spoiled the latest Ghostbusters movie for you guys.
[58:55.15]Let's go.
[59:04.06]Music?
[59:06.76]Good.
[59:12.74]Fucking nutcracker.
[59:19.63]This is Ren and Stimpy's theme song.
[59:23.24]Wow!
[59:25.58]I did not want to be here.
[59:27.76]Oh god, I can't move.
[59:29.42]Come on, I'm still in first place.
[59:31.22]Don't let this ruin everything.
[59:32.32]Come on!
[59:33.98]You're still ahead of everybody.
[59:34.98]Get out of here.
[59:36.18]Go!
[59:36.48]There we go.
[59:47.45]What the fuck am I-
[59:54.63]What have I done?
[59:55.15]What have I done?
[60:04.48]No, I'm okay.
[60:06.36]I'm just about to lose my mind.
[60:11.88]See, this music doesn't help.
[60:15.33]It doesn't.
[60:16.13]This is not helping.
[60:20.60]I might be able to snoo- I might be able to snook by everybody.
[60:42.06]We're good.
[60:48.46]I don't wanna go that way.
[60:52.09]Here we go.
[61:14.03]Get off the exit.
[61:15.22]I'm in fifth place.
[61:19.74]First place.
[61:21.56]Just watch the exits.
[61:23.80]Here we go.
[61:29.63]What's up, everybody?
[61:31.61]I'll be taking first place and the victory.
[61:38.43]Don't blow it here.
[61:47.59]First place.
[61:51.21]New license.
[61:54.93]What do we get for this?
[61:56.89]Your license has been upgraded to Class C. Nice work, but don't think advancing to the Class B will be so easy.
[62:03.22]The event map has been cleared.
[62:04.96]The way forward is up to you.
[62:06.76]Well, first place and the... Alright, I got a... The Ukuza... The Ukuza GT.
[62:12.16]I'm going to try it.
[62:22.13]Alright, I wonder how many people are actually getting annoyed by this fucking music.
[62:32.39]What happened?
[62:38.55]No one, really?
[62:39.47]Okay, no one.
[62:40.73]Alright, good.
[62:42.23]That's cool.
[62:43.87]I'm happy about that.
[62:47.59]Now let's go crash into the gas station.
[62:57.11]Can you just do the thing like you can do it for GTA can I go just go like this Which one of which footballs Where is he Where do you go right here?
[63:21.99]No shit, I didn't even hit him.
[63:25.47]Oh Come on.
[63:26.41]I just scraped him.
[63:28.67]I buttered his bread.
[63:29.65]I didn't even touch him
[63:44.91]Where did he go?
[63:45.75]I swear to god these guys are just fucking troubling me.
[63:54.99]They're just fucking with me now.
[63:57.08]Got him!
[63:57.42]Press R1 and L1 after you crash.
[64:13.61]R1 and L1 together at the same time after I crash.
[64:22.19]Hit the L1 and R1 buttons whenever you like to start showtime.
[64:27.95]What?
[64:28.25]Then smash into traffic to earn boost and increase your dollar score.
[64:31.76]Are you kidding me?
[64:32.38]Press the boost button to bounce your car along the road and keep the crash going.
[64:43.29]So I can just activate it at any time.
[64:53.71]What the fuck?
[64:54.78]Okay.
[64:55.58]You just turn it on.
[64:56.40]I'm just playing Octogeddon again.
[65:05.74]Why?
[65:06.33]Why is this happening?
[65:12.45]You'd think you would turn out of the way.
[65:13.93]There's so many cars.
[65:22.89]What are you people doing?
[65:24.03]We need some cheap cars.
[65:32.44]That bus is very cheap.
[65:35.18]Oh, huge amount of cars over here.
[65:36.50]Let's go.
[65:37.74]Slide over here.
[65:46.14]How long can I do this for?
[65:47.60]30 cars crashed.
[66:02.77]There's no music.
[66:06.36]I got a boss hit so I get a multiplier.
[66:13.53]This goes as long as I want.
[66:15.27]Well, I have to get to a million points.
[66:17.40]Have to.
[66:18.92]One million points.
[66:26.36]Oh, I just jumped over that guy.
[66:27.50]Hey, those guys are trying to run into me.
[66:35.90]Skipping around.
[66:37.14]Sign smash.
[66:44.44]I hear police.
[66:45.48]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[66:46.34]I want a million!
[66:47.96]Dammit.
[66:48.18]Oh well.
[66:48.66]I went pretty far.
[66:51.42]Yeah, I played a clone of this game.
[67:05.12]Really?
[67:05.42]Alright, let's get another car.
[67:09.16]I want to try the new cars.
[67:12.08]Crash time!
[67:19.22]Do you run over buildings?
[67:20.02]I don't think I can go over the railing.
[67:28.34]Can you?
[67:31.21]I guess.
[67:32.01]Probably.
[67:32.39]Oh well.
[67:39.35]Let's see what the music can't play during this.
[67:40.73]That'd be awesome.
[67:47.76]62 million points.
[67:51.55]Alright, new car.
[68:05.37]Oh, bad choice to stop music.
[68:14.10]New car.
[68:19.54]Paradise City.
[68:23.36]You can hover around in the DeLorean.
[68:25.90]Well, don't get to tell me twice.
[68:27.71]Let's get out of the way.
[68:31.99]The Ecto one was fun.
[68:32.87]Let me try something else.
[68:42.82]I don't know.
[68:43.22]Avril Lavigne?
[68:43.84]Well, there's a pretty small percentage chance we're going to see it.
[68:49.29]Cool.
[68:57.87]Let's see what we got.
[69:03.99]Pioneer.
[69:05.89]I'm a pioneer!
[69:10.11]I don't know why that's all I can think of.
[69:11.31]That word only triggers that in my brain.
[69:15.53]Pioneer cards.
[69:16.55]Paradise cards.
[69:21.93]Strength.
[69:25.92]Toy vehicles, legendary boosts, special cop cars.
[69:28.14]Let's see.
[69:32.56]Cool.
[69:38.78]A lot of vehicles in this game.
[69:42.02]That's cool.
[69:42.74]I like it.
[69:48.07]Gunner optics.
[69:48.93]You know gunner optics were on Shark Tank because their company is failing?
[69:54.20]The CEO of Gunner Optics went on Shark Tank to try to get money from the Sharks on NBC.
[70:00.52]I couldn't believe it.
[70:08.42]What is this?
[70:15.26]I didn't get a good look at these, though.
[70:17.38]There's only two of them.
[70:19.73]Hawker Mech.
[70:23.43]Use the Back to the Future car.
[70:25.01]Is that under Toy or Special or... Legendary?
[70:28.57]What's it under?
[70:31.43]Oh, that looks... This looks like it.
[70:35.90]GT Nighthawk.
[70:38.78]Cavalry.
[70:43.71]Well, let's do it.
[70:44.37]P1288 Special.
[70:55.38]Is this it?
[70:55.78]I mean, this looks like it is.
[71:00.66]Do you ever drive in a stunt car like this one?
[71:06.61]Jumping off ramps and pulling barrel rolls and flat spins are the fastest way to fill your boost block.
[71:11.83]Hey, boost it up.
[71:13.59]Oh my god.
[71:15.59]Imagine taking a car off the lot and you instantly do that.
[71:28.03]Oh, actually, it actually is, it actually is pod racing.
[71:33.17]Alright, let's get back on the ground.
[71:34.91]Let's do a competition.
[71:36.23]This thing is insane.
[71:40.33]Turning route.
[71:40.83]Wrong car.
[71:41.65]This way.
[71:42.66]Top of the line.
[71:51.88]It's a great vehicle.
[71:54.42]Road rage.
[71:55.94]This one's just crashing into people.
[71:58.43]Ready to road rage?
[71:59.87]It's a running battle with the other drivers.
[72:02.09]Take them down all over town and meet the target without totaling your car or running out of time to receive a mark on your license.
[72:11.42]Just fly and they won't be able to hurt me.
[72:12.74]I can fly over them, right?
[72:15.68]Yeah, I'll just shave them.
[72:18.54]Oh fuck, this is not good.
[72:20.62]Slow down.
[72:22.50]Oh, you stupid idiot.
[72:23.56]You're not even participating.
[72:34.94]Got him.
[72:40.65]Two in a row.
[72:44.75]Three in a row.
[72:45.91]I just mushed him into the corner.
[72:48.89]Got it.
[72:55.15]Wow, that was cool.
[72:56.33]I'm going too fast to even understand what was fun about that.
[72:59.69]I don't know what's fun.
[73:01.95]All I see is a blur in front of my face.
[73:11.21]I got the target already.
[73:11.89]I'm fine.
[73:13.77]Damage is critical.
[73:14.45]I need to get to an auto-repair facility.
[73:16.29]Get on the ground!
[73:16.85]I won't break anything.
[73:30.44]Do I really need to repair?
[73:32.94]I don't think I even need to.
[73:37.97]Trying to fuck that guy up doesn't matter I won 14 wins License picture now.
[73:50.30]Alright fine.
[73:50.74]I'll get it.
[73:51.28]I'll do my license picture.
[73:52.18]I don't know how what do I do it?
[73:53.02]Sure wouldn't it be here?
[74:08.98]Where would it be?
[74:11.86]Big surf.
[74:15.33]I gotta plug my camera in.
[74:21.31]Is it an options menu?
[74:27.29]Restart the game.
[74:36.20]Curiosity Online.
[74:37.28]That's not what I want.
[74:40.26]Splay type.
[74:43.95]You have to start the game while it's plugged in.
[74:46.39]Let me just go get it.
[74:47.93]It's back here.
[74:48.79]Give me two seconds.
[74:49.35]I'll be right back.
[75:54.54]Alright, it's plugged in.
[75:55.16]Let's see if we can get it.
[75:59.51]And I'm probably only going to play for like another 20, 30 minutes to do a couple more missions.
[76:10.67]And then probably end the stream.
[76:14.67]Been going for what, four, just about four and a half hours.
[76:20.52]Okay, please do this.
[76:22.52]And then tomorrow night, a way out with me and Etalyx.
[76:27.88]If the game is fun, I'm assuming we'll play the whole game.
[76:29.62]Alright, let's get a license photo.
[76:39.57]Okay, let me make sure my hair looks alright.
[76:43.35]No, we did a 10-hour stream before, two days ago, not even.
[76:52.32]Assuming you texted me this morning about it.
[76:55.86]You asked me this morning if we were doing that and I said yes.
[77:02.43]Yes, I've read the agreement.
[77:05.57]Welcome to Burnout Paradise.
[77:07.07]Alright, license photo.
[77:11.79]Come on.
[77:20.45]Start a party, enter Paradise.
[77:22.99]Alright, which one is it?
[77:30.58]Enter Paradise city.
[77:33.94]Which one, do I do this?
[77:35.14]How do I do this?
[77:43.29]Is it enter Paradise city or start a party?
[77:49.28]Is that a Paradise city?
[77:56.54]Or is it Big Surf Island?
[77:59.50]Paradise city.
[78:01.90]Where's my, what the hell?
[78:19.81]How do I take this?
[78:21.45]Did I have to do Big Sur?
[78:48.28]When we run a race around here, we don't do that, you know, clear the roads, barricade off the course stuff.
[78:54.35]We've got action kicking off all the time, all over Paradise.
[78:58.33]Take photo.
[78:58.87]There it is.
[78:59.25]Okay.
[78:59.55]Discover how to get where you're going through the traffic or around it.
[79:03.72]This is DJ Atomica on Crash FM.
[79:20.26]No, I'm retaking it.
[79:41.80]Retake it.
[79:58.13]There it is.
[79:59.37]Holy shit, man.
[80:01.76]Hey, hey, you, you.
[80:02.80]I could be your girlfriend.
[80:05.08]Hey, hey, you, you.
[80:09.66]I know it's not a secret.
[80:11.72]Hey, hey, you, you.
[80:12.94]I want to be your girlfriend.
[80:18.35]Buffalo Bill.
[80:20.99]You're so fine.
[80:21.83]I want you mine.
[80:22.61]You're so delicious.
[80:24.85]Not a song of the times, you know?
[80:29.66]You kidding me right now?
[80:30.48]Are you kidding me?
[80:31.16]You see that one?
[80:33.48]You gotta be kidding me.
[80:53.54]Mozart, Beethoven, and Avril Lavigne.
[80:55.94]Survive.
[80:56.24]Go!
[80:56.30]Where's Avril Lavigne?
[80:58.16]Excuse me.
[80:58.66]There it is.
[81:24.45]Remember, if you're ever in a high-speed chase, play this song.
[81:26.37]You'll feel way better about it.
[81:28.33]Hey, hey, yeah, yeah, I know that you like me.
[81:42.52]No way, no way, you know it's not a secret.
[81:43.86]Hey, hey, yeah, yeah, I want to be your girlfriend.
[81:45.34]Jesus Christ.
[81:45.86]I can see the way, I see the way you look at me.
[81:47.30]Even when you look away, I know you think of me.
[81:48.70]I know you talk about me all the time again and again.
[81:52.65]He's obeying the rules of the road.
[81:56.70]Imagine driving by this guy in the middle of this crazy chase and you hear this out of his window.
[82:06.76]You'd be like, holy shit, this guy's fucked.
[82:09.07]This guy's fucked.
[82:09.89]He's fucking crazy.
[82:12.15]We are dealing with a true psycho.
[82:14.75]Bring in the military, you know what I mean?
[82:19.67]Redhead.
[82:21.53]Ooh, out of the way, out of the way.
[82:23.61]I need power in the jump.
[82:42.49]My car turned into a dog.
[82:43.91]I'm going the wrong way.
[82:48.19]Is there even a time limit here?
[82:49.43]I don't think so.
[82:57.98]What?
[82:58.32]Oh, shit.
[83:05.50]No, I didn't want to do this.
[83:06.28]Turn this off.
[83:11.38]Car pogo.
[83:11.94]Wait, boss.
[83:17.50]Oh, dear.
[83:21.69]Jump, jump, jump.
[83:22.65]Get in the water.
[83:25.32]Please roll in the water.
[83:26.14]5,000 damage.
[83:28.46]No.
[83:31.36]No music.
[83:31.84]I know, it ruins everything when the music turns up.
[83:33.57]It sucks.
[83:37.33]Alright, let's go.
[83:38.97]Show's over.
[84:03.06]I'll do, we'll do two more, whatever this one is.
[84:05.32]Burning Rounds.
[84:07.42]I can't do this one.
[84:08.26]I have to finish something so it shows the picture, yeah, that's good.
[84:17.39]This is great, we'll beat it.
[84:24.98]We'll beat it.
[84:28.30]Get a decent car.
[84:31.32]Just don't do anything dumb.
[84:37.07]And go.
[84:37.35]It always surprises me.
[84:47.71]Oh, no, it's over.
[84:48.49]Oh, we got Moonlight Sonata, so this is okay with me.
[85:02.01]Last ride.
[85:14.26]Funny how it changes the dynamic.
[85:17.76]That went from fun joyride to this is scary and sad.
[85:22.38]This is just sad now.
[85:33.55]Don't crash Don't boost boost now in the straightaway you lost your mind Wow Sorry, I just screamed I didn't mean to Didn't want to get crushed
[86:01.02]No, no, no, no, no, no, don't think so.
[86:02.62]I could go with that shortcut, but I don't wanna.
[86:21.88]Yeah, seriously, the VOD is gonna be deleted.
[86:29.62]I wait for this right away and then win.
[86:39.65]Victory.
[86:41.97]Congratulations.
[86:44.75]Don't be sad.
[86:51.07]At least that song is in public domain.
[86:52.53]That's right.
[86:53.37]God.
[86:58.14]What the fuck is it doing?
[87:00.26]What are you doing?
[87:03.33]Huh?
[87:04.15]Why was it doing that?
[87:06.39]Why was it spying on me?
[87:11.78]What?
[87:31.26]Don't ask me why it does that.
[87:32.53]Now let's do one more.
[87:42.81]EA is gonna blackmail me with these dick pics.

[92:06.79]Depends on how much fun it is.
[92:07.61]It could be good, could be bad.
[92:08.73]I don't know.
[92:12.47]Burnout Paradise Remastered seems to be the exact same game as Burnout Paradise, just regular Burnout Paradise.
[92:19.51]I don't think there's very many differences besides the fact that it's 1080p.
[92:23.96]So, I mean, if you already own Burnout Paradise, I don't know if there's a reason why you should ever buy this game.
[92:29.48]Maybe there is.
[92:30.00]Maybe you're a huge fan.
[92:30.92]It seems like it's fun.
[92:31.84]I could sit here and just probably play it for a while.
[92:35.26]It's getting decent reviews.
[92:36.14]That's good.
[93:00.44]I'm just kidding.
[93:01.28]It's a joke.
[93:01.96]We're not doing that.
[93:04.94]Thanks, everyone, for watching.

[95:56.43]Thanks for continuing to support the stream.
[95:58.19]Your subs, everything.
[95:59.33]It fucking blows my mind that people give me money on a weekly basis or monthly basis here.
[96:05.49]So, thank you.
[96:06.71]Appreciate it.
[96:07.99]Moving on to the bits now.
[96:08.80]Let's talk about bits.
[96:09.88]Who is giving bits today?
[96:11.48]Let's do them.
[96:12.38]What do you say?
[96:12.82]Let's go to the regular.
[96:16.84]Drop that a little bit.
[96:19.94]There we are.
[96:20.56]Alright.
[96:24.85]A special thank you to... Stix Renegade for the one dollar.
[96:29.22]Jerma, are you ready?
[96:29.98]You have five seconds to review the game for the stream.
[96:31.96]Go.
[96:34.02]Um... I don't know.
[96:40.35]I don't like episodic content.
[96:42.97]Episodic.
[96:44.21]Whatever the fucking dumb name is.
[96:46.09]Episod... Episodic content.
[96:50.28]It just makes it so you have... It's arbitrary.
[96:52.60]I don't like it.
[96:53.02]I think it's stupid.
[96:54.56]Because it's essentially just a way for you to not give a shit about the game in three months.
[96:59.83]Right?
[97:00.85]Hey, check this out.
[97:01.51]We got episode one.
[97:02.15]It's like a couple hours long.
[97:03.33]It's cool.
[97:03.97]Are you interested?
[97:05.29]Do you think it's awesome?
[97:06.27]See you in two to three fucking months.
[97:09.46]Imagine if a TV show was like that.
[97:11.74]Alright, ladies and gentlemen, episode four of Game of Thrones, Sunday, 9 p.m.
[97:18.08]The next episode.
[97:19.08]Oh, did you see what the Ice King did?
[97:21.26]Whoa, I can't wait.
[97:22.46]See you in fucking May to find out what happens in the next episode.
[97:26.58]Have you already forgotten?
[97:31.68]They did do that.
[97:35.80]But I'm talking episode to episode, not season to season.
[97:40.28]Episode to episode.
[97:42.20]Season to season, there's a beginning, a middle, and an end of a season.
[97:45.74]And then, okay, maybe you have to wait like a year or two for the next season.
[97:48.70]But between episode to episode, that's completely different.
[97:53.27]I don't like playing episode-styled games, because by the time I'm done with the first episode, it's like, oh, that was cool.
[97:58.67]I think a month or two goes by, and I don't even want, I'm done with it.
[98:02.17]I already cared about it.
[98:06.31]A game episode could be a season.
[98:09.08]I don't know about that because Telltale did the whole thing where they would have season two of The Walking Dead and that was a whole nother game.
[98:15.86]They're episodes.
[98:24.87]I think you can wait three months for an episode.
[98:26.51]I've been waiting for years for the next Smite Sunday.
[98:35.31]Yeah, you got me there.
[98:36.11]You're right.
[98:42.23]I can see where they... But then you run into the problem, right?
[98:45.59]Theoretically, you know, 30 to 45 days is fine.
[98:48.67]That's alright.
[98:49.59]But look what's happened in the past with some of these games that are episode-based.
[98:53.08]I don't even need to name you the most famous one, the one that never fucking completed.
[98:57.26]The one that started the episode craze.
[98:59.22]They didn't even get halfway through their episodes.
[99:01.34]And they just gave up and it never came out ever again.
[99:03.53]Right?
[99:03.93]You have that kind of scenario.
[99:05.61]Then you have the scenario where episode 1 and 2 come out back to back a month or so together.
[99:11.43]And then episode 3 comes out four months later.
[99:13.23]And it's so delayed and fucked up.
[99:14.57]That's happened plenty of times.
[99:19.70]Back to the future?
[99:20.34]No, we're talking about Half-Life.
[99:21.92]Half-Life 2.
[99:22.38]Half-Life 2.
[99:25.39]Half-Life 2 Episode 2, Half-Life 2 Episode 3, they just didn't fucking, they just deleted it forever.
[99:35.49]Yeah, Half-Life 2 was supposed to have like five or six episodes.
[99:44.38]Episode what?
[99:46.94]No.
[99:47.44]I mean, that, but just... And for some people, I understand.
[99:50.88]For some people, it's cool, because if you enjoy a game, oh, that was a really interesting, like, three or four hours.
[99:56.23]Cool, that was great.
[99:56.99]A couple months go by, and the new episode comes out, and it kind of hits you in the brain, like, oh!
[100:02.05]Oh, that was kind of fun.
[100:03.81]Oh, I have something else to do now.
[100:05.45]That's cool.
[100:06.03]I understand.
[100:07.33]But for me, I need it all in one go.
[100:10.82]Just personal preference, I would say, at this point.
[100:15.22]But, thank you for, I don't know, we kind of went off there, but thanks a lot, dude.
[100:21.02]Thank you, Stix Renegade.
[100:21.78]Thank you, Snooze and Copter for the $1.
[100:23.16]Can you say my name, please?
[100:24.34]Can you remember my name?
[100:25.73]I'm going to ask you about it.
[100:26.59]Snooze and Copter.
[100:27.57]Of course I'll remember your name.
[100:30.17]Just tell me Tired Aerodynamic Vehicle and I will tell you exactly who you are.
[100:40.18]Uh, Ace McLace gave the $50 earlier, which was a lot of money.
[100:43.91]Thank you, Ace McLace.
[100:44.93]Hexbreed, thanks for the $5.
[100:47.01]Well done, mother.
[100:49.67]Thank you, son.
[100:51.85]Procif, ProStar, thanks for the $1.
[100:53.52]Hey, Jerma, can I use you for a school project?
[100:56.90]Um... You mean you're gonna, like, write a book report on me?
[101:00.24]I'm not, I, I...
[101:03.03]I guess if you if you want to just write about a streamer or something yeah why not just don't as long as that means you're not going to make fun of me on your project maybe you will thanks though dude uh thank you to well some I missed like two people back here Samuel says thanks for the one dollar George Washington looks like your Dark Souls 2 character
[101:34.10]I love Dark Souls character creation, it's so good.
[101:36.54]A science fair project, just pretend to be a volcano.
[101:40.98]I can see that.
[101:44.50]Thank you MooMeans, moo for the one dollar.
[101:45.88]Spoiler alert, this game is actually just an adaptation of Eyes Wide Shut, and George Washington is actually just here... to fuck.
[101:58.02]God.
[101:59.84]Thanks, dude.
[102:00.76]Sawdust Bunnies, thanks for the 45 cents.
[102:04.05]Uh, Grapple Mace, thanks for the $1, gets punched by Long John Silver from Treasure Planet.
[102:12.23]That's perfect, dude.
[102:13.35]It really is.
[102:15.01]Smelly Boy, 11, thanks for the $2.
[102:16.45]Did you know George Washington had a 100% pee-pee diet?
[102:19.67]Tier 100.
[102:22.68]I wouldn't be surprised if they were drinking piss back 400 years ago.
[102:27.26]Back at like 400 years ago, they were probably concerned that they were losing fluids out of their body, and they probably just tried to put it back in.
[102:36.09]Thank you Grapple Mace again for the $1.
[102:37.83]You'll spoil your fucking dinner.
[102:41.09]Yes, I will.
[102:43.43]Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the 25 cents.
[102:45.39]Well, let's see what it tastes like.
[102:46.79]Dips figure in John's cooking.
[102:49.21]I make a funny cartoony facial reaction as I fall on my back with a black scribble floating over my head.
[102:54.45]I really need to stop tasting everything I find.
[102:56.21]Uproarious applause and laughter.
[103:00.74]Red Gear, thanks for the $1.
[103:02.58]Jerja, I love you.
[103:03.68]Thanks, dude.
[103:05.91]Humans weren't even around 400 years ago?
[103:07.71]What are you talking about?
[103:14.25]1700s?
[103:14.59]1600s?
[103:14.69]17?
[103:14.71]18?
[103:16.35]19?
[103:16.37]20?
[103:16.69]21?
[103:16.71]2100, you know?
[103:17.00]That three or four hundred years ago, the 1600s, that's when... so much crazy shit happened back then.
[103:21.70]People were around in the 1700s, what are you on about?
[103:23.58]Am I getting bej- I'm getting, uh... I'm getting bejaded right now.
[103:26.50]Whatever.
[103:28.36]Uh, thank you Young Chub for the 15 bucks.
[103:32.10]Just pulls a book out of his chest.
[103:37.54]Oh, yeah, I remember that.
[103:38.30]That was fucking funny.
[103:40.80]Thank you, YoungChup, for the $15.
[103:41.66]Appreciate it, dude.
[103:44.38]Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the quarter.
[103:47.45]Which one of these characters will wind up in the next Jerma Rumble?
[103:49.61]Kermit George Washington, Forgetful Jason Voorhees Butler, Pink Eye Garfield Wolverine, or California Raisin Face?
[103:57.39]Hey, Jerma, is it true that you're in Ready Player One playing the role of drunken Pac-Man?
[104:01.23]I was invited on set for one day to pose for a Garfield Easter egg.
[104:04.63]If you find it, I'll cook you some lasagna.
[104:07.56]The answer to that question is Avril Lavigne.
[104:12.28]Thank you, Fred Flintstone, for the $100.
[104:17.27]From earlier.
[104:18.47]It's a lot of money, dude.
[104:19.25]Thank you so much for your huge monetary contribution.
[104:24.81]Thank you.
[104:27.29]Samuel Sish, thanks for the $1.
[104:29.87]The player character looks like a violently malnourished Hugh Jackman.
[104:32.95]That's what we're talking about, the Wolverine thing.
[104:35.15]Looks like Wolverine.
[104:36.53]Thanks, dude.
[104:39.06]Mad Ninja 4, thanks for the $1.
[104:40.98]Ken Yodikwet.
[104:44.84]Fam.
[104:47.33]I don't know.
[104:48.75]Wild Hub Buddy, thanks for the $0.25.
[104:51.07]Your trick didn't work.
[104:52.99]Chat would decipher the DaVinci Code to see a sex scene on stream.
[105:00.01]I'm sure they would.
[105:02.02]Grapple Mace, thanks again for the $0.25.
[105:04.32]Aha.
[105:04.40]Oop, oop, ee, eep.
[105:14.27]What is this?
[105:14.71]I have no idea.
[105:16.95]Thank you, Hydra, for the $1.
[105:18.46]Over the past couple of months, I've donated about $20 just to make you say shitposts.
[105:22.86]Here's a real message this time.
[105:24.26]Thank you for being so awesome.
[105:26.94]Thank you for even considering to give a stranger on the internet $20.
[105:30.61]Like I said, it blows my mind every day.
[105:37.84]I just hope you guys are having a good time.
[105:39.16]Thank you.
[105:42.06]Hydra, again for the $1.
[105:42.80]Pee-pee, poo-poo, hi.
[105:44.74]Hi.
[105:45.55]Oh, alright.
[105:46.55]Thanks for the two bucks there.
[105:47.89]Appreciate it.
[105:49.63]Snooze and Copter, thanks for the $1.
[105:51.03]I hope you had fun playing Burnout Paradise.
[105:52.55]The moment I write this, everything could still happen.
[105:55.97]Anyway, I love that game.
[105:57.34]I played it all the time back in the day, and the title screen made me really nostalgic.
[106:01.34]Is... Oh, this is going to be fun, hopefully.
[106:05.20]No, it's fine.
[106:08.91]It's just an arcade racer with a bunch of crashes.
[106:11.47]You can't really go wrong.
[106:15.51]Samuel Sish, thanks for the $1.
[106:16.85]Nice clown car race.
[106:17.97]Still gonna crash one in May, right?
[106:19.41]You said you would.
[106:20.13]Yeah.
[106:22.89]I'm a man of my word, I told you.
[106:26.22]MooMeansMoo, thanks for the $1.
[106:27.52]Local streamer eagerly sits on the side of the road with popcorn to laugh at horrific car crashes.
[106:35.16]Roberto12213, thanks for the $3.
[106:39.79]LOL, I don't know if I did this right, but here you go.
[106:42.83]You did.
[106:44.17]I appreciate the three bucks, dude.
[106:45.67]Thank you.
[106:47.86]Hydra.
[106:48.24]Again, thanks for the $1, Hydra.
[106:49.44]I'm gonna throw up.
[106:50.48]Stop crashing and making me laugh.
[106:52.80]Damn it.
[106:56.26]I told you, any game that has a car that you can drive into stuff, it just makes it fun.
[107:02.17]Mango Sharpie, thanks for the $1.
[107:03.57]Great $1 joke.
[107:05.63]I'm not sure what it was, but hopefully I deserved that $1.
[107:07.41]Thanks, dude.
[107:10.46]Mango Sharpie again for $1.
[107:11.98]Here are some more free bits you wacko.
[107:16.00]Listen, tobacco is wacko if you're a teen, okay?
[107:19.72]Don't do it.
[107:20.80]Don't smoke.
[107:22.97]Sticks Renegade, thanks for the $1.
[107:24.19]I haven't laughed like this in a long-ass time.
[107:25.69]This is why you're the best, and I think many people here agree.
[107:31.21]Thank you.
[107:33.33]Like you guys, I just like having fun.
[107:37.23]I don't... I just try to have fun with everybody here.
[107:41.23]That's pretty much all I care about.
[107:43.24]Like I've said a thousand times.
[107:44.22]What if I'm 18?
[107:48.08]That's still teen.
[107:49.02]Tobacco is wacko if you're teen.
[107:52.78]But I appreciate the incredibly... wonderfully kind message.
[108:00.34]Thank you.
[108:02.66]Roberto, again, 12213, thank you for the $1 again here.
[108:06.34]Everyone else is doing it, so I'll do it again.
[108:07.94]Uh, you should facecam a scary game soon.
[108:11.00]Those were always my favorite.
[108:13.62]Yeah, I think the scary games have sort of turned into VR streams.
[108:18.15]We've kind of evolved past sitting here playing some, like, SCP game into, hey, there's a new terrifying game on VR that I'm gonna play.
[108:28.59]Pretty sure that that's kind of taken its place.
[108:31.00]But, appreciate it though, thank you.

[109:23.90]I modified it to work as an emote, even made three of them in the correct size for a Twitch emote.
[109:28.88]Am I actually going to use that?
[109:30.35]Fun.
[109:31.35]It's gonna, I'm, okay, here's what I'll do.
[109:33.61]I'll use the pickle brick stupid dumb fucking Rick and Morty reference emote for three days.

[109:42.45]And you guys get to choose which three days they are.
[109:45.48]Not now, at the beginning of next stream before we get going.
[109:49.16]We're gonna pick a date.
[109:50.44]We're gonna pick a week that you guys get to have that emote.
[109:53.38]It could be within the next couple of years.
[109:56.17]Get it for three days.
[109:59.85]Thanks, dude.
[110:03.33]Uh, Luxter1234, thanks for the $1.
[110:04.86]Hey, Jeremiah, I'm interested in getting into PC gaming.
[110:07.64]So I'm trying to save up to invest in a better setup to play high performance demanding games.
[110:12.53]Since you prefer to play games on PC, do you have any tips or suggestions on how we should start or what I should buy?
[110:19.34]Um, you know who, uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna do like a, I'm gonna do like just a shout out for a person that's on YouTube right now.
[110:24.93]It's Linus Tech Tips.
[110:28.01]That's probably if you want a good resource for like how to's and tips and tricks on Various things the computers.
[110:34.65]He's probably the best channel to go to I would assume But if I were to give you Like reddits to there's plenty of reddits out there
[110:52.49]Like, I think there's like a PC build Reddit that can help you out too.
[110:55.87]Because I know enough, but I don't really know enough.
[110:58.57]It depends on your budget and all that stuff.
[111:04.18]How to start PC gaming.
[111:05.12]Don't buy a GPU right now.
[111:09.42]No, but just, I remember back, like, I mean, it might be outdated by now, but I remember watching some Linus videos and they were like, they're very easy to understand.
[111:17.29]Um...
[111:20.59]A lot of his basic videos can help you out a lot.
[111:23.35]If you have no idea what's going on.
[111:30.81]PC part picker is good.
[111:32.10]There's a lot of good.
[111:33.62]Here's the tip I'm going to give you.
[111:35.28]Head to the Discord.
[111:37.56]Can we get the Discord on here, please?
[111:41.48]There's tons of people there that'll probably help you out.
[111:43.98]More than I could by a long shot.
[111:47.41]But, uh, I wish you luck.
[111:48.39]I would say don't spend too much money.
[111:49.71]You don't have to spend that much money to get current games to run very well.
[111:53.70]You don't have to get a Titan to get, like, 60 frames, 120 frames in a lot of these games these days.
[112:02.00]I'm sure a lot of people have some good, um, ideas.
[112:08.78]Uh, anyways.
[112:10.07]Thank you, Luxter.
[112:10.77]Thank you, uh, CrunchyJester for the Bondala.
[112:12.85]I staple tapeworms to my
[112:17.16]Penis, so the worms will drink.
[112:21.78]What are you doing?
[112:22.70]I'm not even going to read that whole thing.
[112:26.52]That was just, that was something I would never say out loud.
[112:30.08]If I said your sentence out loud anywhere, someone's going to be mad at me.
[112:35.12]Someone, somewhere.
[112:36.91]Asian turtle, thanks for the $1.
[112:39.75]I didn't know you starred in Spider-Man.
[112:41.49]What's he on about here?
[112:45.94]Oh, that's a picture of Willem Dafoe.
[112:47.75]Yep.
[112:49.95]I know.
[112:50.31]I am aware of our resemblance.
[112:54.37]He's a fucking handsome guy.
[112:55.37]He's smart.
[112:56.33]He's incredibly talented.
[112:58.13]Please keep comparing me to one of the most talented character actors to ever live.
[113:01.92]I'll take that comparison every day.
[113:05.66]Butterfingers, thanks for the $1.
[113:07.06]Not necessarily for stream, but since you liked Super Meat Boy way back, Celeste is really fun.
[113:12.29]Love you, Jerem.
[113:13.59]I'll check it out.
[113:16.67]I love Super Meat Boy.
[113:20.73]It's a great game.
[113:24.95]I might be a little late to the party on that.
[113:27.47]But if for one day we don't have something we're going to be doing, or if I don't know what I'm going to play on a certain day, sometimes that happens.
[113:33.38]That happened today.
[113:35.32]Because I know what I was doing tomorrow.
[113:36.74]I knew what I was doing yesterday.
[113:38.50]But today was the outlier.
[113:40.28]So on days like these, I kind of just look around at what's out there.
[113:46.24]And I don't know, maybe one day I'll be like, yeah, fucking let's go.
[113:49.06]Let's do it.
[113:51.83]But thanks, dude.
[113:53.33]Thank you, LukeM1230 for the $1.
[113:55.95]Jeremy, you are my favorite streamer.
[113:57.17]Thank you for the amazing entertaining streams.
[113:59.65]Thank you for giving me your attention because there's tons of other people that are out there that also stream and do YouTube videos.
[114:08.21]So thank you for giving me your attention.
[114:13.01]Samuel Sish, thanks for the $1.
[114:14.47]The bits readings are my favorite parts of any stream.
[114:16.40]This interactivity is one of the many things that make your content shine.
[114:21.14]I like giving bits because I know it goes to support you, not just you, but also this awesome community.
[114:25.62]I watched all 10 hours of your Monster Hunter 2 stream and didn't feel like it was time wasted.
[114:31.53]Also, I made that Hugh Jackman joke before you made your Wolverine joke you'll be hearing from my lawyer.
[114:36.51]I admit it's a monster ranch or two.
[114:38.23]I've made that mistake dozens of times.
[114:39.65]Don't worry.
[114:42.39]But thank you.
[114:45.43]Thank you for being here.
[114:47.88]I'm... would like to continue to do this for as long as I can.
[114:53.28]And I want to make... I want to put the effort in to try to make them as fun as I can.
[115:01.55]So, thanks for even giving me the opportunity.
[115:06.52]This guy just got fired.
[115:08.38]I just wanted to put the effort in there.
[115:10.18]I wanted to make sure it was good.
[115:12.34]Thank you for the opportunity.
[115:13.33]And then I walk out of the room.
[115:14.61]I just got fired.
[115:16.57]Thank you, Smelly Boy, for the $1.
[115:18.53]Caravago was a 16th century painter known as the first of the Baroque painters who drank pee-pee.
[115:26.65]Good, interesting tidbit there.
[115:30.65]Grapple Mace, thank you for the 25 cents.
[115:34.03]Hey, hey, you, you.
[115:34.97]Thank you.
[115:37.54]Then, of course, Ace McLace with the 50 bucks a few minutes ago.
[115:40.28]Hope you enjoy the VOD.
[115:43.04]Thank you for your huge amount of money.
[115:46.06]Moo means moo.
[115:46.78]Thanks for the $1.
[115:48.20]Pertinent pee fact.
[115:49.22]Ancient Romans also used pee as invisible ink to write secret messages.
[115:52.92]The words would show up when the paper was heated.
[115:55.52]There is a chance that the main character of the council found a message written in his mother's urine.
[116:01.18]That is very odd, but interesting to know.
[116:03.88]Thank you.
[116:05.48]And to wrap it up here, Fred Flintstone for the $1.
[116:07.58]Thank you.
[116:08.00]I regret only saying poo-poo pee-pee in my last year.
[116:11.74]I want to at least tell you you're my... You're the best and love your streams daddy.
[116:17.74]There now, it was worth it.
[116:19.87]Fucking goddammit.
[116:21.75]Thank you, Fred Flintstone.
[116:22.93]Thank you, Roberto12213 for the $1.
[116:25.51]If we keep donating, does the stream never end?
[116:27.99]Nope, because it's turning off right now.
[116:31.09]See you guys tomorrow night.
[116:31.79]A way out.
[116:32.41]Etalyx.
[116:33.37]It's gonna be fun.
[116:34.95]Get there.
[116:35.41]See you soon.
