[00:05.30]Man, this bridge freaks me out.
[00:06.90]Yeah, it really does.
[00:08.42]It's just like, where am I gonna fall down?
[00:11.87]Got that skelly on the left.
[00:13.37]Oh, there's a chest down there.
[00:15.47]Forget the chest, man.
[00:16.27]We gotta get that enchanted bow.
[00:22.21]Except everyone is... I think Jerma went the wrong way.
[00:25.30]Or did I go the wrong way?
[00:27.04]Oh, there he goes.
[00:29.44]Watch out, there's a skeleton that saw you.
[00:31.32]It's up to me and you, Lefter.
[00:33.54]I looked over to see you because I heard you say, I think you went the wrong way.
[00:36.34]I turned and I fell.
[00:39.04]I'll take responsibility for that.
[00:42.58]Where am I now?
[00:44.01]Did you not spawn?
[00:45.43]Yeah, I did.
[00:46.25]Watch out, there's a cave spider waiting for you.
[00:48.33]Alright, where did you die, Lefter?
[00:50.43]Did you head towards the melon farm?
[00:52.17]Yeah.
[00:54.09]Okay, well... In one of the houses.
[00:56.18]Well, I'm running, man.
[00:58.02]In the house?
[00:58.90]Oh, you blew up the house?
[01:01.91]I don't know.
[01:03.97]Is that a, this looks like ruins to me.
[01:06.25]Yeah, it's on the right.
[01:07.94]On the right, okay.
[01:10.66]I think the sun's about to come up.
[01:14.74]Oh god!
[01:16.46]Oh that spider, it's like a baby spider.
[01:18.64]Yeah, watch out, it'll poison you.
[01:20.17]Were you inside the ruins, or outside?
[01:22.73]Yes, inside, inside.
[01:25.15]I love it how this skeleton's stupid enough to still target you.
[01:29.68]Oh, oh, I see your stuff.
[01:30.85]Oh, there's, like, creeper spawners down there.
[01:33.57]Oh, well, that could be a reason.
[01:35.48]Alright, nighttime's stopping, though, so that's good.
[01:37.72]Oh, oh, I think I got your stuff.
[01:40.02]I think I got it.
[01:44.45]Did you get the bow?
[01:45.61]Let me see.
[01:46.13]Let me see.
[01:46.77]Yes.
[01:47.39]Yes, I did.
[01:48.41]And I think I got my stuff too.
[01:49.77]I found all my stuff.
[01:50.49]I died.
[01:50.97]I died on the way there.
[01:52.76]On the way to you.
[01:53.56]I dropped a lot of glowstone.
[01:55.36]I'm being pursued by a bunch of people.
[01:57.48]A bunch of angry people.
[02:01.62]They're all burning though.
[02:02.30]Where's the sword?
[02:07.48]I have the sword.
[02:07.86]I didn't take anything out of this chest.
[02:08.92]I have the sword.
[02:09.38]I think he took it.
[02:10.60]I'm juking.
[02:11.48]Okay, there's the glowstone.
[02:13.01]Oh yeah.
[02:13.71]I can't pick it up.
[02:14.29]My inventory's full.
[02:17.75]They're surrounding me.
[02:21.43]I have one heart.
[02:23.45]Okay, I gotta use the snowballs.
[02:27.74]Well, I have two hearts now.
[02:29.80]How much damage do snowballs do, if any?
[02:32.33]They don't do any damage.
[02:33.43]They just do knockback.
[02:34.09]They just do the knockback?
[02:35.39]Oh, that's annoying.
[02:37.23]Okay.
[02:39.70]I'm going back.
[02:40.68]Oh, there's so many creepers out here, man.
[02:44.48]You guys are gonna be, like, watching my video later, like, I'm gonna be, like, football running back right here, man.
[02:48.92]Just dodging and weaving.
[02:52.34]Just juking.
[02:54.74]Get out of my way, you dumb zombie.
[02:56.30]I got places to be.
[02:59.31]No, no, no.
[03:00.35]No, no, no, no.
[03:01.49]No, no, no, no.
[03:02.97]Run.
[03:04.47]Just run.
[03:05.91]That's my new philosophy.
[03:08.27]Okay, guys.
[03:08.91]I'm in the tunnel.
[03:09.71]I'm in the obsidian tunnel with all the stuff.
[03:15.29]I see you guys now.
[03:17.10]We're going to go make a safety deposit.
[03:20.32]What a nice sight.
[03:21.82]Just you.
[03:23.12]Safety.
[03:23.64]Coming out.
[03:24.76]Yes, successfully.
[03:26.96]From that horrible place.
[03:29.15]You just picked up some bones, by the way.
[03:32.04]I did that on purpose.
[03:34.54]No, God.
[03:37.83]Alright.
[03:38.37]Here's your bow.
[03:40.67]It's useless.
[03:42.85]No, it's not.
[03:44.55]Because... Look at that.
[03:48.61]You found 5,000 arrows.
[03:50.43]I found 35 arrows.
[03:54.54]And... I need to get rid of all these snowballs.
[03:58.60]Just pass them to me.
[03:59.82]I'm making snow blocks right now.
[04:01.54]Hey guys!
[04:02.54]Hello!
[04:03.14]I'm home.
[04:08.31]Finally.
[04:09.49]So what did you do today?
[04:10.71]I dodged about a hundred creepers and a handful of zombies and skeletons and spiders to get all of our stuff back.
[04:19.25]That's great.
[04:20.60]I died like nine times in a row.
[04:22.38]Alright, guys.
[04:22.98]We're going to split up the resources here.
[04:25.68]The bad news is I've only got two loaves of bread, and I'm going to eat those.
[04:31.13]The good news is we each get one piece of armor.
[04:35.93]Which one am I getting?
[04:38.49]You've already got goggles on on your...
[04:41.78]It looks like you've got goggles on, so... We're gonna give... Oh, wait, no, that's, uh, Lepther.
[04:45.84]Lepther's got the goggles.
[04:46.73]So you get... You get the helmet.
[04:48.85]Lepther... Lepther gets the boots.
[04:50.73]Oh, I get the helmet.
[04:52.67]And then I'm the greedy one who saved everything, so I get the leather tunic.
[04:56.75]So... Oh, you can have, uh... I'll give you the good wooden sword, though.
[05:03.23]Oh, wait, I've got... That's all I care.
[05:05.05]I care about the good wooden sword and the box helmet.
[05:09.12]Alright, come out here, guys.
[05:11.99]Okay, we've... Depositing everything for safekeeping.
[05:26.55]I love how that just kind of started, like, nobody said anything, it was just like, open, okay, close, alright.
[05:34.25]Uh, do we have any coal?
[05:35.47]Uh, we can get some.
[05:37.74]We need some torches to disable, we need to disable these mob spawners somehow.
[05:43.40]Wait, do you pick up my glowstone?
[05:45.00]Oh yeah, yeah.
[05:46.40]So there we go.
[05:47.62]Here, let's split it up so that we each have...
[05:50.72]Can I have some of those blocks?
[05:54.42]There's some for Jerma.
[05:57.64]They're like a light block, but once you place them, you can't break them back.
[06:01.33]Oh, I almost just put a bunch down.
[06:04.65]That's why I made sure to say something.
