[00:02.01]Hello.
[00:06.41]He forgot to talk.
[00:08.51]No, no.
[00:09.01]Alright, alright, alright.
[00:09.89]Listen, listen, listen.
[00:13.45]He's very early.
[00:14.39]I'm like seven minutes early.
[00:20.98]Were you all right at the end of yesterday's stream?
[00:25.86]Yeah?
[00:28.22]Yeah, what do you mean?
[00:31.31]At the end of the stream?
[00:32.38]What happened?
[00:32.76]What happened at the end of last night's stream?
[00:42.92]I don't know.
[00:46.60]What is the person talking about?
[00:50.66]He forgets.
[00:51.26]Jesus, this is bad.
[00:54.94]Wait, didn't I scream?
[00:55.70]Wait, didn't we raid somebody?
[00:57.04]Did we raid somebody and I screamed because I ran out of time?
[01:00.24]Is that what you're talking about?
[01:01.53]What happened?
[01:02.47]We didn't raid anybody last night, did we?
[01:03.85]Yes, we did.
[01:05.59]We raided Ludwig.
[01:13.62]Anyways...
[01:17.32]Oh, by the way, I was there for Ludwig's raid song.
[01:21.87]It was fucking pretty good.
[01:24.39]You guys just make everybody do the raid song.
[01:26.33]He's sitting there like... Like, do the raid song, do the raid song.
[01:30.03]Keep singing.
[01:30.39]He's like, what is the raid song?
[01:31.39]He's like, we don't have a raid song.
[01:32.94]You're just confusing the absolute fuck out of him.
[01:36.26]And on the spot, he just turned on a little music file and he did a song better than anything I could have ever done.
[01:47.15]Do the raid song.
[01:48.21]You guys are going to confuse everybody we ever raid.
[01:56.95]We're raiding you right now.
[01:59.80]No, you're not.
[02:03.36]Yeah, I think everybody we've raided has had to do a raid song.
[02:08.92]You guys can't just force people to do a raid song.
[02:12.18]Anyways.
[02:13.82]Tonight, we're going to play Hitman 3.
[02:17.17]I'm very scared to open up the save file because I'm going to be very honest with you.
[02:23.05]This third level, I'm just going to kill them and run to the exit.
[02:27.40]I don't like this place.
[02:29.50]I'm going to just find the people.
[02:30.62]I'm going to kill them and run and save state and run out of the level.
[02:36.16]I think.
[02:38.09]We also had a thing today, which I want to go over.
[02:42.61]It was about maybe playing Hitman while a little bit high.
[02:46.88]Right?
[02:48.56]And while I think that's a fun idea,
[02:51.49]I want to make sure I let you guys know this.
[02:54.53]There is going to be no debt wiping today.
[02:58.33]This is not going to do any debt.
[03:00.19]This is not for any reason in particular.
[03:02.79]I don't want to incentivize like doing drugs on stream for a benefit.
[03:10.34]So if I'm going to do anything, it's going to be because I just feel like it.
[03:16.54]I do it sometimes.
[03:19.32]But no, I don't really like the idea of incentivizing me doing drugs.
[03:24.54]I don't think that's cool.
[03:25.48]I think that's not a good way to... I think that's not a good start to like doing something like this.
[03:30.56]So... Because like, oh, hey, hey, hey, dude, 500 million if you get high right now.
[03:36.92]Wait, right now?
[03:37.59]Okay, yeah.
[03:39.33]No, that's not going to happen.
[03:41.39]So there's no incentive here.
[03:43.23]If I'm going to do it today, I'm going to do it for fun.
[03:45.73]And that's it.
[03:50.32]There's no, don't, there's no debt wipes or anything like that.
[03:58.54]Pull, pull out the, what?
[04:01.82]Cube bong rips.
[04:03.18]No, no, no.
[04:03.94]And I'm not going to do that.
[04:05.00]Look, Hitman is a very complicated game.
[04:09.96]And I know a ton of you guys are going to laugh and be like, no, it isn't.
[04:12.58]You just have to go strangle people with piano wire.
[04:16.01]I know, I know it's not, it's, but it is.
[04:18.76]Okay, if there's more than like 100 people in a room, and I have an apple in my hand, and all the people in that room can get hit in the face by an apple, it's incredibly complicated.
[04:29.99]There's too many... The flowchart is all over the place.
[04:38.21]So, we're going to try to do this level that I... Dude, I don't even remember.
[04:45.25]I just walked around in a circle for 20 minutes and said, I hate this.
[04:48.05]I hate this place.
[04:48.65]I fucking hate cement.
[04:49.91]Delete this level.
[04:51.46]And I couldn't figure out how to get back to the dance floor.
[04:55.54]So I'm just going to really try to beat this level because I want to see the rest of the game.
[05:00.88]You're no longer family friendly.
[05:02.66]You got to click the 18 plus mature audience warning.
[05:05.68]You know how many times I have to say that?
[05:09.84]How many times do I have to say that?
[05:11.52]This is a mature audience stream.
[05:13.20]We talk about mature things here.
[05:15.38]Like your favorite Yoshi character.
[05:19.97]Mine's definitely Boshi.
[05:27.20]Alright, let's go.
[05:33.15]Alright, I have to be ready for this.
[05:37.05]Look, the best pitchers in the major leagues, if they let up a home run, if they let up 10 runs and they have to pitch two days later, the last one didn't even happen.
[05:46.91]You gotta delete it from your memory.
[05:49.80]Didn't even happen.
[05:50.34]So, that last stream didn't happen.
[05:58.22]All right, here we go.
[05:58.64]So, like, I'm ready.
[05:59.48]I'm ready to pitch.
[06:00.61]I'm ready to pitch right now.
[06:01.55]I'm ready to pitch.
[06:03.01]I got to kill that guy over there.
[06:03.99]Gun.
[06:04.63]With a gun.
[06:05.05]Gun.
[06:05.39]Gun.
[06:07.07]This is really loud.
[06:07.61]Hold on.
[06:10.03]Spoilers.
[06:11.49]This is level three.
[06:12.99]Yeah, we're playing Hitman 3, level three.
[06:16.68]Are you high already?
[06:17.58]No.
[06:21.36]All right.
[06:21.64]Hitman 3, level three.
[06:23.12]I'm currently the DJ.
[06:25.00]Poison.
[06:25.82]Those look pretty good.
[06:30.06]What's going on here?
[06:30.62]What's wrong with my computer?
[06:31.36]All right.
[06:33.49]No, don't go into this.
[06:34.45]Don't go.
[06:34.81]Don't go into the cement yet.
[06:36.87]Who'd I kill?
[06:40.35]Kill somebody?
[06:43.66]Who died?
[06:44.68]Somebody died?
[06:47.44]Somebody just walk off a cliff?
[06:50.62]Okay.
[06:50.92]All right.
[06:51.18]Where are you?
[06:51.94]Okay.
[06:52.14]I'm going to kill that guy over there.
[06:54.51]Save it.
[06:54.91]Somebody died.
[06:55.63]Perfect.
[06:59.74]Holy shit, that's fucking unbelievable.
[07:01.00]Alright, thank God.
[07:02.56]I only have to kill, I don't even know how many more people.
[07:04.16]Well, let's go.
[07:06.08]What do I have for weapons?
[07:06.94]I don't have any weapons, do I?
[07:09.08]Oh, yes, I do.
[07:09.54]Alright, I'm gonna syringe somebody in the neck.
[07:12.08]That's very important.
[07:12.82]I'm gonna go... Wait.
[07:20.58]He's so good.
[07:23.12]Let's go get this guy over here.
[07:24.36]I'm gonna syringe this person.
[07:25.29]Put the syringe away.
[07:28.96]Wait, I thought I'm not allowed in here.
[07:34.08]Is he going to be mad that I try to come in?
[07:36.19]Tech only.
[07:40.51]Brown this guy in froth.
[07:41.81]All right, hold on.
[07:42.31]There he is.
[07:42.65]All right, play it cool.
[07:50.04]Intel, what?
[07:59.12]You wanna bench press me?
[08:02.36]What the fuck?
[08:03.76]That was intel?
[08:08.90]Actually, just kill.
[08:09.96]What do you think I'm trying to do?
[08:11.13]Okay, I'm gonna follow this guy around.
[08:15.29]That's the guy I have to kill.
[08:24.27]I'm gonna syringe him in the neck and I'm gonna step on his head.
[08:28.75]This person's gonna fight me.
[08:29.37]Look at this person.
[08:29.85]Walking up to me like they're gonna punch me in the face.
[08:32.25]Get away from me.
[08:42.88]Where you going?
[08:43.20]Okay, so I can't do it on the dance floor.
[08:45.02]Does he, like, go to the bathroom over here?
[08:46.14]Alright, he goes in here.
[08:47.48]Who else is in there?
[08:50.73]There's some tech people in there.
[08:53.37]Wait, that's two of these guys to get.
[08:54.95]Oh, shit.
[08:55.51]Hold on.
[08:56.41]They come in this little staff room.
[09:01.36]Can I go in that?
[09:01.98]Maybe I can go.
[09:02.44]Okay, I'm going to go kill people in the staff room first.
[09:04.18]What do you think?
[09:05.87]That's probably a good idea.
[09:07.69]Does he walk this way or that way?
[09:10.89]Oh, God damn it.
[09:11.81]I hate this place.
[09:13.85]I'm really thinking about just going up and stabbing him in the neck and then running and stabbing the other guy in the neck and then killing the other guy and then stabbing.
[09:19.32]I just want to kill both these guys right now.
[09:32.69]Does he only walk?
[09:33.49]Alright, I need to get in this.
[09:35.31]Can I sneak around him?
[09:36.01]Alright, he goes in here.
[09:39.76]His path goes in here.
[09:41.50]What's in here?
[09:42.82]I'll just take this.
[09:43.56]I need a key card.
[09:49.34]Just... The DJ's just following a guy around.
[09:55.27]There has to be a creative way I can kill this guy, right?
[10:05.92]I'm thinking about... I'm going to syringe him in the neck and run.
[10:08.96]What else am I going to... I don't know.
[10:09.89]Look, I know this is probably an elaborate way to... What?
[10:17.05]Just do it and run.
[10:18.07]I just want to see if this guy's path is just a circle on the dance floor.
[10:27.76]Because if it is, then we have to drop a chandelier on his head.
[10:34.76]That's the one thing I wasn't doing last time.
[10:36.20]I wasn't following their individual paths around.
[10:38.20]Where's he going?
[10:39.72]Okay, there he goes.
[10:41.94]Where's this at?
[10:42.52]Where's this at?
[10:43.18]Where's this at?
[10:46.15]Opportunity coming up.
[10:50.47]Probably right here.
[10:51.09]I should have done it right there.
[10:58.11]Oh my god, can I throw a beer bottle at... What the fuck are you talking about?
[11:03.35]God damn it, dude.
[11:04.21]Really?
[11:06.92]Shut up.
[11:07.48]Don't point.
[11:07.90]You're playing hide and seek.
[11:08.91]Don't point at me.
[11:13.61]How could you?
[11:14.51]What?
[11:14.69]You don't know that?
[11:15.29]I'm the DJ.
[11:16.93]I'm the DJ.
[11:18.91]You want to... You're going to... That's this random guy here?
[11:21.68]Is the guy that you're going to give information to?
[11:23.88]You came here to see me tonight.
[11:25.34]Don't you want to make me happy?
[11:26.66]That's him.
[11:27.44]Time to move.
[11:36.74]He's dead.
[11:37.42]You're the broom.
[11:38.50]Who's shooting?
[11:39.10]Pfft.
[12:01.40]I'm just going to go fucking kill this guy.
[12:03.28]I'm just going to go syringe him.
[12:04.12]I don't care.
[12:04.46]I don't like this level.
[12:05.70]I don't.
[12:06.08]I don't like this level.
[12:06.78]I'm just going to go syringe him.
[12:10.30]Who is this?
[12:25.71]Is that one of them?
[12:28.20]How could...
[12:33.39]God, I hate this level.
[12:39.15]Where is it?
[12:39.55]Right here?
[12:42.53]Just use a gun.
[12:43.31]I don't have a gun.
[12:49.42]The syringe doesn't kill them.
[12:56.90]I'm just going to fucking sprint.
[13:00.05]I'm allowed to be here.
[13:01.09]I'm the DJ.
[13:11.61]What do you mean, what am I doing back here?
[13:13.70]This is my set.
[13:15.30]This is my, you're on my set.
[13:30.09]What do you mean they see three, they see 3PO?
[13:32.53]What?
[13:33.03]They see through you.
[13:33.79]Hey, what are you doing back here?
[13:39.25]You're not supposed to be back here.
[13:41.18]Oh, by the way, I loved the last song you played.
[13:48.45]You'll be paying me in the parking lot, right?
[13:55.52]No, I did it again.
[13:56.40]Oh my God, I hate this level.
[14:19.41]I have to beat this level.
[14:21.91]I hate this place.
[14:31.24]Where's my opportunities?
[14:32.94]I don't have any intel.
[14:33.76]I need my intel.
[14:34.74]There's no things to do.
[14:39.86]I just have to follow these people around and then kill them?
[14:43.95]There's like 3,000 people here.
[14:56.27]Entitled streamer needs his intel.
[14:58.27]Where's my intel?
[15:05.50]You know what?
[15:06.02]I'm going to go after that guy up there.
[15:07.36]Fuck this.
[15:11.80]Where are the opportunities?
[15:12.62]No, there's no opportunities because this is not like an assassin mission.
[15:15.36]This is just going to avoid the red guy, but kill the red guy.
[15:22.04]There's no assassination here.
[15:35.63]I'm going up there.
[15:37.05]Alright, I'm going to go up.
[15:37.79]I'm going to wait for his path to go up that way.
[15:42.84]Why are you already mad?
[15:44.70]I hate this level.
[15:50.04]And this guy's got a bodyguard with him too.
[15:56.95]Alright, you know what?
[15:57.91]Do you have any grenades?
[15:59.73]I'm throwing a grenade in that room.
[16:06.24]He's going to come through here.
[16:06.88]Hold on.
[16:07.04]Wait.
[16:07.14]This is my opportunity.
[16:07.72]Right here.
[16:09.00]I'm going to save it right here.
[16:09.72]Watch this shit.
[16:10.66]I'm going to get one right here.
[16:33.18]Come on.
[16:33.54]Walk through here.
[16:40.14]He's zonked and naked.
[16:43.56]Does he take a right or take a left?
[16:45.52]I think he takes a right.
[16:53.45]Here he comes.
[16:58.91]Where's my intel?
[17:12.32]I need that... Look, I know.
[17:14.09]I'm one of those... Wait, disguise is number six.
[17:20.81]But I'm not allowed to be... Wait a minute.
[17:21.85]Do they like me now?
[17:23.09]Nope.
[17:23.33]Put that back on.
[17:26.51]Look, I know.
[17:27.07]I'm one of those people that... I'm playing Hitman.
[17:30.29]You gotta play it the real way.
[17:31.45]You know, you can't have any, like, any intel.
[17:34.15]No blue markers on the map.
[17:35.73]But I'm sorry.
[17:36.89]I'm a... I need those.
[17:40.20]I need you to show me where, like, the thing to drop the chandelier is.
[17:43.04]I need it.
[17:47.55]Let me go up.
[17:49.79]Hey, just walk up and round a circle.
[17:51.11]All right, this guy's dead.
[17:53.57]I'm going to cut this guy off in the concrete up here, and I'm going to kill him.
[18:02.23]Could I disguise as somebody else that he trusts or something and, like, lure him away or take him somewhere or do something?
[18:06.98]I feel like I don't have anything to do.
[18:12.40]There was the electrocute the guy with the tree.
[18:16.52]What other things can I do to these guys?
[18:28.89]They just walk around up here.
[18:30.19]Alright, I might be able to kill him over there.
[18:35.63]I can come back here, yeah.
[18:39.14]That's the plan.
[18:39.76]This is the play.
[18:40.38]The play here is I'm going to brick.
[18:41.53]Okay.
[18:41.83]This is the play.
[18:42.43]I got it.
[18:44.31]These two guys walk down here.
[18:45.61]I'm going to wait.
[18:46.19]They're going to cycle over here.
[18:47.21]I'm going to hide right here.
[18:47.97]I'm going to brick the first guy and I'm going to punch him.
[18:49.87]I'm going to.
[18:52.05]What will kill them?
[18:52.79]Definitely crowbar.
[18:54.67]A knife.
[18:55.03]All right.
[18:55.23]I'm going to stab him.
[18:55.91]I'm going to stab him in the head.
[19:11.24]Did they walk back this way?
[19:12.16]If they do, I'll hide over here.
[19:13.90]I just don't want these techs to see this.
[19:21.47]He's definitely ADHD.
[19:22.57]Too much to wait that long.
[19:29.51]Oh, I don't like this.
[19:30.66]I like the 47.
[19:31.56]This is Diana here.
[19:32.60]Here we have Bingleberry Tingleberry.
[19:37.14]An oil rig.
[19:38.40]Machinery extraordinaire.
[19:40.00]He's welled up in his panta.
[19:41.64]I don't want to just wait around and follow the fucking red outline guy.
[19:43.94]No.
[19:44.90]I hate this.
[19:45.50]I don't like this level.
[19:55.01]Just go kill them.
[19:56.21]I tried that.
[19:57.47]Every single person in this dance floor has a gun.
[20:01.11]They just start firing at me.
[20:11.20]I really might be too ADHD to wait this long.
[20:13.46]I have to wait this long.
[20:18.50]Kill one and take their gun.
[20:19.42]That's the plan.
[20:20.76]The plan is when this guy dies, I'm going to stab him in the throat.
[20:23.72]No, first of all, I'm going to throw... I have two of these.
[20:25.38]I'm going to throw the knife into his face and then kill his partner.
[20:27.65]I'm going to take his gun.
[20:30.13]I'm going to lean over the edge.
[20:31.01]I'm going to shoot that guy in the fucking head.
[20:32.19]And I'm going to go to the exit.
[20:38.79]This is going to take so long.
[20:45.09]In fact, I could probably just do this right now.
[20:48.55]Can I reach from here?
[20:49.78]Wait, can I reach from here?
[20:50.86]Nobody will know what it is.
[20:54.26]Nobody will know if I can get it from here.
[20:58.50]Nope, it does not.
[20:59.50]Okay.
[21:03.41]All right, here they come.
[21:05.27]Where are they?
[21:05.73]Where'd he go?
[21:08.47]There he is.
[21:08.85]Okay, I'm ready.
[21:10.07]I'm going to be ready to save it so I don't fuck this up.
[21:18.93]There are five guards.
[21:19.99]No, there's not.
[21:21.01]There's four.
[21:22.93]Wouldn't I have found the other one by now?
[21:25.73]If there's a fifth guard that I... If I have to walk around and just stand next to people until one of them puts a thing on their ear, I'm not going to be happy at all.
[21:41.24]There are five.
[21:41.82]Great.
[21:43.86]Get up here already.
[21:47.38]This is awful gameplay.
[21:50.25]Look, this is probably the worst Hitman gameplay you're ever going to see.
[21:53.29]Okay?
[21:55.07]You could put a headset on your dog and put the mouse on their paw and then put a treat in the air and the movement from the tail wagging, the moving, and their paws going back and forth would probably kill both these guys.
[22:12.70]Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[22:18.38]Wait.
[22:18.96]Wait a minute.
[22:20.44]Is he alone?
[22:22.04]They're both coming off here.
[22:24.80]Can I get a double?
[22:26.20]Here we go.
[22:26.54]Here we go.
[22:26.86]This is important.
[22:27.58]I got two of these.
[22:28.24]I'm going to throw one in his head.
[22:30.02]Let Otto play.
[22:30.91]Hey, tiger.
[22:31.59]Thanks for the vibe.
[22:35.27]You're just standing there.
[22:36.17]Yeah, I'm being an assassin.
[22:39.73]Assassins like wait for their prey.
[22:47.25]Come on.
[22:47.83]Just walk down here.
[22:50.71]This is a nice concrete stream.
[22:53.33]Don't even get me started on that concrete.
[22:55.08]Where is he?
[22:56.06]Why is he walking that way?
[22:56.94]Are they going to come this way?
[23:07.28]You're a camper.
[23:09.06]I have to get out of this level.
[23:10.04]I need to beat this level because if I skip this level, like a lot of people have said, then I didn't beat Hitman 3.
[23:17.71]Here they come.
[23:20.43]Don't walk all the way down.
[23:21.85]Take a right.
[23:22.77]There we go.
[23:23.19]Okay, here we go.
[23:29.91]You played the other games.
[23:30.69]You should know how to play this one.
[23:31.63]This is the first time they've done a mission like this.
[23:34.16]Where there's no target.
[23:35.02]You just have to like wait around and like fucking kill the guy.
[23:38.36]I'm ready.
[23:38.80]This is it.
[23:39.22]Are you ready?
[23:39.80]First time.
[23:40.20]Here we go.
[23:40.56]First try.

[25:01.51]I'm skipping the level.
[25:02.75]I'm skipping the level.
[25:12.25]Why did he hear it?
[25:12.95]He shouldn't have heard it.
[25:18.38]That was so stupid he got face stabbed Okay, well obviously they see this so I need to move I Have to wait even a little longer, but what even if this is surprising if this guy's standing he's just standing here, right?

[38:45.94]No, no, no.
[38:46.60]When I went to the drug dealer, it said, oh, searching now.
[38:48.92]I didn't do anything.
[38:50.75]He got, like, scared.
[38:52.77]I think somebody comes up these stairs and sees him.
[38:54.33]Okay.
[39:05.20]Found him.
[39:06.32]Found him.
[39:09.92]I just like karate chopped his neck.
[39:12.08]Okay.
[39:12.88]I think that I think I'm going to clear now.
[39:20.08]Talk to the drug dealer.
[39:30.80]Drug dealer.
[39:31.78]Hi.
[39:35.13]What's up?
[39:37.01]Ask about buying drugs.
[39:40.68]Follow me.
[39:44.14]I can't go that way.
[39:45.70]I can't.
[39:45.96]Can we go a different way?
[39:47.24]Can we go a different way?
[39:47.89]I can't go.
[39:53.81]I'm sorry.
[39:54.17]I know somebody here.
[39:55.03]I don't want them to see me here.
[39:56.13]I don't want them to see we went to the same club on the same night.
[40:00.31]I literally texted this person that I wasn't around tonight.
[40:03.60]That I had family in town.
[40:04.86]Okay, so fucking come on.
[40:06.44]Can we go a different way?
[40:20.78]Thanks.
[40:22.58]How do I... How do I syringe him?
[40:38.26]What?
[40:44.33]What's wrong with him?
[40:48.73]Why is he not falling down?
[40:55.03]This guy, I think this guy does a lot of drugs.
[40:58.01]So, like it's not going to make him fall down.
[40:59.77]I think he'll be okay in like five minutes.
[41:03.76]I can't kill.
[41:13.40]I feel kind of like.
[41:20.39]I can't even, I can't hurt this guy.
[41:50.32]How did I break it I just stabbed him and I was trying to take his clothes Just stupid
[42:06.40]I wanted to subdue him so I could take his clothes and hide his body because I'm the drug dealer now and I can go to one of the staff members with the drugs.
[42:13.33]He was sitting there going and the game was glitched and I couldn't even get out of it so I had to shoot the guy.
[42:25.16]I gave that plenty of time for that to work itself out and it didn't so I had to shoot him.
[42:47.52]I had to.
[42:48.14]Fuck.
[42:54.17]Don't sell me the drugs right here.
[42:55.19]What are you, stupid?
[42:55.77]Can I save it here?
[42:57.41]Okay, thank God.
[43:01.99]Do a Richard Nixon impression?
[43:03.13]Sure.
[43:08.86]There.
[43:09.30]That'll be a thousand dollars.
[43:14.14]In joke currency, fake money.
[43:15.96]Not real money.
[43:25.61]Why does he drop it on the ground?
[43:29.33]You notice that?
[43:30.29]So give it to me.
[43:33.82]Oh, right.
[43:34.18]He wants money.
[43:36.75]Should I... That's what I wanted to have happen last time.
[43:50.65]Get silent.
[43:53.25]Somebody will hear me if I stab him.
[43:59.42]Okay.
[43:59.78]I'm now the drug dealer.
[44:00.90]So now I have to walk up to one of these guys and sell drugs to him.
[44:10.50]Okay, which one of these guys does the drugs?
[44:12.04]Let's see if it's you.
[44:27.49]I have something for you you might like.
[44:32.29]Why wouldn't he?
[44:32.95]He should put on like a... Put a voice on, right?
[44:37.09]47 never puts a voice on.
[44:39.32]Every time you disguise, he's just like, yes, I'm here, the chef, ready to serve you.
[44:44.63]You think if he was an assassin like that, why wouldn't you put a voice on?
[44:48.15]Put a voice on.
[44:51.43]Why do I have to just speak my normal voice?
[44:58.12]This guy doesn't want any drugs, I don't think.
[45:10.78]Like, at some point, I've never been recorded.
[45:13.87]And if I'm the most incredible assassin in the world, nobody picked me up.
[45:19.63]Like a microphone in an office complex being like, the job is done.
[45:24.16]I just blew it.
[45:26.72]I got too close.
[45:27.26]I was talking.
[45:48.41]It's hard crashed, I have to... Oh, god damn it.
[45:51.36]Okay.
[45:51.48]Oops.
[46:13.77]I think that was just... You just walked directly in front.
[46:20.11]It was so quick that you wouldn't even be able to avoid it if you wanted to.
[46:26.80]Did that person lean in?
[46:28.34]Was that person over my shoulder with a stretched out neck?
[46:33.70]Being like, hey, what's happening over here?
[46:35.81]Like Beetlejuice style?
[46:37.39]Like a long neck?
[46:41.79]Like, I don't understand.
[46:49.66]Watch the clip.
[46:50.54]The hitscan was behind you.
[46:52.08]What?
[46:57.30]No, hold on.
[46:58.52]I actually do want to see how this happened.
[47:01.68]Let's see.
[47:11.43]Let's see how this played out.
[47:12.31]Okay.
[47:23.30]Let's see.
[47:23.74]So I'm walking around.
[47:30.56]Like, at some point, I've never been recorded.
[47:33.62]And if I'm the most incredible assassin in the world, nobody picked me up.
[47:39.39]Like a microphone in an office complex being like, the job is done.
[47:43.91]I just blew it.
[47:45.25]Who is this person?
[47:46.49]I got too close.
[47:47.09]I don't see.
[47:47.57]It was a lady, right?
[47:48.15]It's this lady right here.
[47:52.77]What happened?
[47:53.83]What?
[47:54.29]I just blew it.
[47:56.85]I got too close.
[47:57.38]I was talking.
[47:59.05]There she is.
[47:59.55]She walks forward.
[48:01.39]The gun is out.
[48:04.10]The gun is in front of me.
[48:05.78]And I shoot her directly in the head.
[48:09.10]It's like I held the gun up and pointed my wrist backwards and just blew her head off.
[48:13.20]What?
[48:16.58]I got too close.
[48:17.08]I was talking.
[48:20.01]This is one of those scenarios where this is the assassin behind me.
[48:23.45]And this is just a big show with this guy in front of me.
[48:28.10]She's coming up to kill me.
[48:29.38]Wrist back kill.
[48:30.42]Okay.
[48:36.42]The bullet is from the camera.
[48:37.92]Third person game.
[48:45.20]Let's go.
[48:47.36]Let me turn it up too.
[48:47.99]It's a little low.
[48:52.65]The hit scan is from the camera.
[48:57.34]Well, I guess we figured that out.
[48:59.98]Where's the save point?
[49:00.80]17, right here.
[49:02.92]Where is it?
[49:03.46]Yeah.
[49:15.58]This game is zonked.
[49:20.56]When are you going to get high?
[49:23.34]Look, relax.
[49:24.27]And I...
[49:25.97]When am I going to... Hey, I'm only here for the guy to get high.
[49:28.83]Yeah, I mean, I heard that this dude was going to like just get high today.
[49:33.28]That's the only reason why I showed up.
[49:36.96]Wait, why does the guy... The drug dealer has a key card?
[49:49.69]I may or may not be currently partaking.
[49:51.49]You don't know.
[49:52.17]And I'm doing it on my own for my own amusement.
[49:57.21]What is even back here?
[49:57.85]Okay, so this dude right here does not care about drugs because he literally, I followed him around for a minute or two.
[50:07.64]Okay, I can't unlock this door.
[50:11.44]Yes, I can.
[50:12.78]Oh, no, I can't.
[50:16.86]Let me guess.
[50:17.24]The person that wants the drugs is somebody I've already killed.
[50:21.10]Let me guess.
[50:23.56]We get to do the fun thing where we now walk around in circles until somebody goes, Yeah, I'm looking for him.
[50:29.03]I don't see him.
[50:31.99]Out of the 5,000 people here.
[50:33.65]Why are you dressed up as Paddington Bear?
[50:43.75]I don't know, man.
[50:55.84]Okay, so I don't think it's anybody else on the dance floor.
[50:58.94]We're looking for a girl.
[51:04.44]The fifth agent is a girl.
[51:05.62]Does the guy want drugs?
[51:09.84]Get out of here.
[51:13.36]Looking for a girl.
[51:19.03]Who are you?
[51:19.63]Approach.
[51:20.25]What?
[51:41.95]I really think it's one of the people back here.
[51:48.98]I did not explore this way yet.
[51:50.68]I got to find this last person.
[52:01.45]Why not?
[52:02.67]Hey.
[52:03.99]Hey, vouch for me.
[52:07.53]Vouch for me.
[52:08.57]Look, I'm with a tech.
[52:11.83]Can you vouch for me?
[52:12.57]Can you say something, please?
[52:19.22]Say something.
[52:21.48]Say something or I'm going to blow this up right now and say that I'm selling you drugs.
[52:25.18]Say something.
[52:27.39]Hey, Bob Richardson is buying drugs from me.
[52:30.81]Say it.
[52:31.47]Let us in.
[52:36.01]Let us in.
[52:36.79]Are you really trying to get me?
[52:37.87]I will expose you right now.
[52:39.31]I don't care.
[52:39.71]People know I'm the drug dealer.
[52:40.62]Everybody knows me in here.
[52:43.00]I'm the drug dealer with the red hat.
[52:54.74]All right.
[52:54.98]All right.
[52:56.95]Alright, looking for... We need... River girl.
[53:01.26]They keep communicating with... There's a girl assassin somewhere.
[53:07.62]Up top, maybe.
[53:08.12]Is this guy still following me?
[53:16.05]He is.
[53:17.63]What if I never give this guy drugs?
[53:19.91]I just take him on an elaborate just follow mission where he just follows me around.
[53:28.55]I can't talk to him.
[53:33.95]Oh, you're getting upset.
[53:38.70]Omega Lull Skyrim partner.
[53:40.54]Oh, wait, here's the merch store.
[53:47.92]Is there an assassin in here?
[54:05.31]Nobody here.
[54:06.05]I'm looking for the last person.
[54:08.05]Staff only.
[54:08.93]There's no one even back here.
[54:12.25]This is the front.
[54:18.84]Was there anybody even... Did I even check out front?
[54:23.64]You know what I mean?
[54:24.14]Like, I feel like I didn't spend very much time back here.
[54:25.86]Is somebody in here?
[54:27.12]Somebody out here?
[54:27.82]In the line?
[54:31.77]I don't know where this final person is.
[54:40.88]Is he just waiting in the line?
[54:41.74]I don't know.
[54:42.28]What?
[54:42.54]I have... What?
[54:43.48]What is he talking about?
[54:45.30]He's doing like a football juke to spin around him.
[54:48.34]Okay, alright, alright.
[54:50.53]I'm gonna leave.
[54:50.93]I'm gonna... You whip around.
[55:08.81]Where's the other one?
[55:11.21]Where's the last one?
[55:11.83]Where's the last guy?
[55:13.97]Where's the last one?
[55:15.33]Where's the last one?
[55:19.09]Davenport, I killed Davenport.
[55:20.14]Where's the last one?
[55:26.60]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[55:28.28]I don't wanna hurt anybody.
[55:28.96]No, no, no, I don't wanna hurt anybody.
[55:33.61]I don't wanna hurt anybody.
[55:34.97]I don't wanna hurt anybody.
[55:37.74]I- Who's the last guy?
[56:08.06]Wait, is it live?
[56:08.76]Is that guy live?
[56:13.08]Wait, the guy that I shot in the head is live.
[56:18.19]No, he's not.
[56:25.37]I can't save it until I'm not hunted anymore.
[56:30.54]Oh, fuck.
[56:31.20]I gotta go down.
[56:38.05]Did I save it?
[56:45.35]Oh!
[56:53.60]Oh!
[57:08.46]Oh, drop that item.
[57:09.38]Drop it.
[57:09.96]Drop the item.
[57:10.56]Drop the item on the ground.
[57:11.52]Drop the item.
[57:12.26]Drop the item.
[57:12.86]Shit, I didn't... I gotta get his body.
[57:23.32]Give me his body.
[57:23.82]Give me the body.
[57:24.31]Who the fuck are you?
[57:24.95]Who's looking at me?
[57:25.57]Who are you?
[57:26.09]What are you doing?
[57:26.57]I guess unconscious.
[57:46.72]Somebody said, does he know the controls?
[57:53.18]Yeah, but holding G is awkward.
[57:57.17]It's like a weird button to have it be.
[57:59.55]It's like E.
[58:08.07]There's a real nasty troublemaker out there.
[58:11.09]Don't you say that for, like, somebody dropped, like, firecrackers, like, outside?
[58:15.19]Not like someone's killing people with an axe?
[58:19.33]Thank God I found security.
[58:20.24]There's a real, like, rascal troublemaker out there dropping firecrackers.
[59:05.42]You gotta be fucking dead.
[59:08.76]No!
[59:09.32]Time to move.
[59:12.10]Now press the advantage while you still can.
[59:15.22]Enough, enough.
[59:22.03]He got another.
[59:23.23]Your sitting ducks evacuate the area immediately.
[59:35.56]God dammit, it's getting me out of this mission.
[59:37.06]I don't want to do this one anymore.
[59:38.02]I hate this place.
[59:44.35]Fucking game is lagging.
[59:45.45]Oh my god.
[60:14.21]Of course this camera hits me.
[60:17.01]Really?
[60:17.59]That camera's gonna do this?
[60:30.72]Audible frustration intensifies.
[60:32.62]This doesn't even feel like a Hitman mission.
[60:42.88]Where's the exit?
[60:50.26]No!
[60:56.48]The exit's like up here.
[61:07.69]Okay.
[61:10.87]Where does he go?
[61:16.96]I think I have to go up another floor.
[61:19.25]Let me see.
[61:20.81]Let me look at the map.
[61:23.33]Club security.
[61:24.38]Let's go level zero.
[61:27.18]Okay.
[61:30.39]Let's see.
[61:36.24]That guy just walks around down here.
[61:37.94]He just walks around in a circle.
[61:40.48]I probably had to have done something to him down there.
[61:43.44]The exit's up here.
[61:44.30]You leave through this way.
[61:45.30]I just gotta run.
[61:45.94]But how am I gonna kill this guy?
[61:49.32]How do I kill this guy down here without causing a huge scene?
[61:53.31]Poison or something?
[61:54.77]That's not the drug guy.
[61:56.09]I don't know.
[61:59.01]He goes into that side room.
[62:01.65]I think I'm gonna shoot him in the head and then run.
[62:04.65]I need to take over the next mission.
[62:17.05]I just have to get out of here and run by with a bicycle.
[62:19.73]That's the plan.
[62:28.50]Yeah, I know this is dog shit gameplay.
[62:30.56]This is like horrible gameplay, Andy.
[62:32.64]I know.
[62:33.12]But I want to see that.
[62:34.34]I want to get out of here.
[62:34.92]I don't like this level.
[62:51.36]Kill him already.
[62:51.94]I'm just going to wait until he gets into view so I can do it.
[62:54.11]And I better not shoot this lady in the head.
[62:57.47]I better not.
[63:06.31]Don't.
[63:06.96]No one stand behind me.
[63:07.88]He's actually coming upstairs.
[63:13.22]This is perfect.
[63:18.65]Alright, here we go.
[63:19.21]Line it up.
[63:20.61]Get a good line of sight here.
[63:22.76]Right there.
[63:23.42]Right there.
[63:23.76]Here we go.
[63:24.10]3, 2, 1, action.
[63:25.30]Get out.
[63:27.52]Get out.
[63:27.78]Get out of my way.
[63:28.40]Get out of my way.
[63:33.79]They don't know it's me, right?
[63:34.81]They don't know it's me.
[63:36.35]They have no idea.
[63:49.03]What?
[63:49.21]I just went the wrong way?
[63:53.34]That guy shot himself.
[63:54.50]Wait, what happened?
[63:57.82]This wasn't the right way?
[63:58.46]Isn't this the... Hold on, let me see.
[64:14.53]Where does this go?
[64:19.65]This goes up here.
[64:24.39]And then... Bang a left, right?
[64:27.30]Out this way?
[64:27.98]How do I get out of here?
[64:32.78]What is the actual, like, exit?
[64:41.27]It was the other way?
[64:46.89]So like down here.
[64:48.50]Wait, so come here.
[64:49.50]Like over here.
[64:50.96]That's not good.
[64:55.54]You have to go up to exit, don't you?
[64:57.88]Up the stairs to the right.
[65:03.75]This way and then you're trapped here.
[65:07.79]No, not up the stairs.
[65:08.86]It's the same staircase.
[65:13.53]And then to the right?
[65:15.97]But then, wait, straight through here?
[65:17.53]Let me see.
[65:23.67]Where's just the actual... I've never even been out here yet.
[65:27.03]What the hell is this place?
[65:33.18]What the fuck?
[65:33.60]What is this?
[65:36.66]Why is there nobody out here?
[65:37.88]What's the point of this whole area?
[65:46.33]Just follow the exit sign.
[65:51.97]Hold on.
[65:52.29]Is this the exit?
[66:04.92]That's the exit, right?
[66:09.63]Alright, I'm going for it.
[66:17.44]There's more areas with more agents.
[66:19.22]I hope you enjoy it.
[66:19.90]I hope this is your favorite level.
[66:24.12]I hope you love this place.
[66:25.14]I will never open this level ever again.
[66:29.28]I'm not going to open this level
[66:43.35]You could tell me that there was like five BTC hidden on this level and I wouldn't care.
[66:47.44]I'd be like, I don't care.
[66:48.26]I don't want to even go in there.
[66:49.28]I'm not going there.
[66:54.24]How am I following that?
[66:57.90]Follow the goddamn exit signs!
[67:01.55]Ha ha ha!
[67:12.44]There was two green exit signs.
[67:14.54]Okay, fine.
[67:24.58]No offense, but please get... Oh, you got... Yeah, yeah.
[67:29.88]Oh, no!
[67:34.49]Help!
[67:34.59]Enough!
[67:35.15]He got another.
[67:36.33]You're setting ducks.
[67:37.43]Evacuate to the area immediately.
[67:45.46]Where am I?
[67:47.10]It's the bright lights and the fucking concrete and the thousand people.
[67:50.54]Get me out of here.
[67:52.12]Get me out of the streamer room.
[67:54.03]I don't want to be in this live streamer's room.
[67:56.51]Okay?
[67:56.85]Get me out of this place too.
[68:02.49]Excuse me.
[68:03.39]Excuse me.
[68:03.79]Goodbye.
[68:04.31]Goodbye.
[68:04.65]Goodbye.
[68:05.01]Goodbye.
[68:05.40]It was very nice.
[68:06.40]That was very fun to see you.
[68:08.58]Goodbye.
[68:09.16]Exit.
[68:09.56]I'm out.
[68:13.44]Where's the exit?
[68:17.43]Let me locate the exit.
[68:19.63]I didn't leave?
[68:20.87]Who the fuck are these people?
[68:21.97]I'm going into the fucking sewer.
[68:29.73]Get out!
[68:30.79]Get out!
[68:31.05]Go in the sewer!
[68:31.49]What are you doing?
[68:43.92]Go in the sewer!
[68:45.66]Go in the sewer!
[68:46.72]Where's the- Oh my fucking god, why can I not go in here?
[68:54.77]What?
[68:55.77]Put the gun away.
[68:57.19]Get me- What the fuck?! !
[69:18.18]I need you to keep your head down if you want to stay alive.
[69:21.27]Sure.
[69:21.99]Okay.
[69:22.81]Bye.
[69:25.01]Get out of here.
[69:31.41]I'm hiding behind this guy.
[69:34.46]Oh, my God.
[69:35.36]Are you serious?
[69:38.04]Yes.
[69:38.34]When will it end?
[69:38.96]Why can't I leave?
[69:41.25]Why can't I go down the sewer?
[69:43.21]What the fuck is this buggy shithawk?
[69:46.43]Shithawk?
[69:48.53]What's a shithawk?
[69:49.73]A shithawk?
[69:50.05]That's some kind of large bird.
[69:51.91]Don't let him take control of the situation.
[70:12.08]My god, why can't I fucking leave?
[70:20.07]Why are they doing this to me?
[70:21.49]They're doing it to me on purpose.
[70:24.21]They're doing it to me.
[70:24.71]This is on purpose.
[70:48.56]Please, get away from me.
[71:00.08]Exit combat?
[71:01.39]Are you kidding me?
[71:05.07]Just reload it.
[71:07.03]Is that what was happening?
[71:08.51]I couldn't go in.
[71:12.47]Use the map.
[71:13.73]The map in Hitman is one of the most confusing things in the whole game.
[71:18.75]No, no.
[71:18.99]What do you mean blind?
[71:20.45]I can't even go up there.
[71:27.55]It was an arrow.
[71:28.31]I know, but I was trying to see if I could sneak away.
[71:30.81]It's just taking me the same way.
[71:33.03]Why couldn't I just go in the manhole cover?
[71:37.80]Jesus, you're a stormtrooper.
[71:53.32]Because you were in combat.
[71:54.50]No, I wasn't.
[71:54.94]I wasn't in combat when I opened the manhole.
[71:59.88]I did like the whole G to exit and it didn't do anything.
[72:16.48]Go right into the store and then right again.
[72:19.14]It bugged out.
[72:22.19]Put the silencer on.
[72:23.39]Guys, I didn't unlock the silencer because the game doesn't stay connected to the internet for more than fucking two hours.
[72:29.50]You remember that shit?
[72:30.28]I don't have any unlockables.
[72:35.86]I've completed like two missions being kicked offline, so I have no progress.
[72:40.78]Just stop killing them.
[72:41.96]Die.
[72:52.75]It's the starting gun, is it?
[72:54.83]Oh.
[73:02.44]We're getting real anger.
[73:06.72]No, we're not.
[73:07.44]I just like, I couldn't unlock any cool things.
[73:10.94]All right, just fucking come on.
[73:12.59]Just get out of here.
[73:14.89]I'm going to listen to the one guy and see if they're right.
[73:20.46]I said go to the store, take a right.
[73:27.02]Please don't let me down.
[73:30.01]Don't let me down, one guy.
[73:30.71]Come on.
[73:35.89]Come on.
[73:54.01]I don't want to get killed.
[74:04.14]I can't.
[74:05.54]I can't.
[74:07.13]I can't just run.
[74:07.97]I'll die, guys.
[74:09.63]I'll die.
[74:10.35]I will just die and I can't save.
[74:13.49]I'll get shot like three times in the back and die.
[74:22.59]Yeah, I will.
[74:23.41]I'll die.
[74:24.01]I will die.
[74:25.01]These guys are made out of, like, ceramic.
[74:35.68]Why?
[74:36.00]I don't... Alright, I'm going to settle down.
[74:40.14]I'm going to relax.
[74:43.41]If I could rank every Hitman level across every single one of the video games, this is below E.T.,
[75:09.55]Alright, my favorite comment I've read was in all capitals.
[75:19.56]This sucks and you suck.
[75:23.22]At least we both equally suck.
[75:25.14]It's not just... We both equally suck.
[75:32.73]Come in, Delta 6.
[75:33.43]This is Big Cat on Tango's last known position.
[75:36.41]Nothing here.
[75:37.19]No visual.
[75:38.07]Please advise.
[75:38.83]Over.
[75:43.79]Thank God.
[75:44.49]Damn it, man.
[75:45.35]Fuck this place.
[75:46.27]Never coming back here again.
[75:47.03]This is going to be like five achievements to get here.
[75:48.87]You're never going to see this opened up ever.
[75:52.46]We started back here like taking a phone call.
[75:54.32]Remember?
[75:54.62]I was like, I got to try to call somebody.
[75:57.96]They got my message.
[75:59.54]Where are you?
[76:15.94]The Joker?
[76:16.52]How did I get this many achievements for this?
[76:22.16]This is so embarrassing.
[76:25.10]This is so embarrassing.
[76:26.90]That's the most amount of achievements for a level that I think I've gotten in any level.
[76:30.56]Even doing it right and doing it the way that you're supposed to.
[76:33.86]What is it?
[76:34.24]That's embarrassing, isn't it?
[76:47.25]Oh man, finally.
[76:48.03]What a shithawk of a level.
[77:01.81]cock maybe that's what I was saying I don't know oh cool you're hurt you should see the other guy never killed nobody before and he's like and I'm right here and he's doing jumping jacks and he looks huge and he's really really good you really are all gray said you'd be
[77:34.53]47.
[77:34.57]He didn't suffer, did he?
[77:41.01]He made it count.
[77:50.92]Nobody cares about the Hitman story.
[77:52.32]Skip.
[77:55.22]I mean, I don't, but I'm still going to watch it.
[77:59.22]I didn't care about like the Sonic the Hedgehog the movie storyline, but I watched it and thought it was cool.
[78:05.10]It's time we start afresh, you and me.
[78:08.27]Get to the point.
[78:10.25]You and your friends pulled off the impossible.
[78:13.31]You stormed the heavens, took down the untouchables, and yet here we are.
[78:19.05]Status quo.
[78:21.16]It just goes to show you can't fight power, Miss Burnwood.
[78:25.34]Power never dies.
[78:26.92]It only changes hands.
[78:29.76]The best thing to do is claim it.
[78:34.12]pretty nice picture of a uh it's the thing that gets you to the thing as the next constant
[78:48.36]It's the thing that gets you to the thing.
[78:56.08]Power is the thing that gets you powerful.
[78:58.20]It gives the thing to different people, to you, to me.
[79:00.96]It's power.
[79:02.14]It's an object that we can grasp and hold and bring it and bring it hard.
[79:06.60]And bring the gas.
[79:13.41]Power, power.
[79:13.95]Power is power.
[79:19.08]Power is a curious thing.
[79:21.16]Are you fond of riddles?
[79:22.24]Why am I about to hear one?
[79:24.58]Three men stand in the barracks.
[79:26.93]A priest, a rich man, and a clergyman.
[79:30.31]Each is bidding the sellsword to kill the other man.
[79:34.11]Who kills who?
[79:35.45]Well, that depends on the sellsword.
[79:37.01]Does it?
[79:37.72]He is of not gold or no favor with the crown.
[79:40.56]It depends on the sellsword.
[79:41.72]I don't know.
[79:42.16]Well, I'll tell you.
[79:42.94]A very small man can cast a large shadow.
[79:54.08]No, otherwise it's very small.
[79:55.40]Did I say it right?
[79:55.96]I said it wrong.
[80:02.93]Look closer.
[80:04.61]I'm telling you, the file is trashed.
[80:06.99]John Oliver.
[80:07.69]The constant doesn't so much burn his bridges as blow them up.
[80:11.85]Arthur Edwards, whoever he was, don't exist anymore.
[80:16.30]His personal data somehow deletes itself from any system that records him.
[80:20.44]Way beyond advanced.
[80:23.24]The partners spared no expense to make sure their control would be untraceable.
[80:27.56]How untraceable?
[80:30.52]Look, I did what you asked, but Gray's gone and I'm no Diana.
[80:34.21]That's the first sentence I actually comprehended in about six minutes.
[80:39.99]They're hacking somewhere.
[80:41.71]I used every encryption known to men.
[80:43.55]Who are these guys?
[80:46.35]The best.
[80:47.87]It's only a matter of time before they get lucky.
[80:51.25]We need to take them down.
[80:54.07]You and which army?
[80:55.79]I don't need one.
[80:56.27]I know where the agency stores its files, mission reports, client data.
[81:01.65]If we leak it to the public.
[81:03.77]You want to whistleblow the ICA?
[81:06.45]It's the path of least resistance.
[81:08.15]Holy shit, they made a Hitman movie.
[81:09.75]Turns out, you are who I need right now.
[81:12.55]Did anyone see it?
[81:13.75]I don't think anybody saw it.
[81:15.70]And I'm out.
[81:19.32]So, what are we breaking into?
[81:22.22]Data facility in Chongqing, China.
[81:24.12]Three of them?
[81:24.74]Run by a man called Hush.
[81:28.32]Of course.
[81:28.88]The ICA site in Chongqing houses the agency's data storage and analyst division.
[81:36.70]Needless to say, security is daunting.
[81:40.34]The state-of-the-art server vault is biometrically wired to the facility's two overseers.
[81:46.04]Imogen Royce, behavioral analysis pioneer, and Hush, a data security guru with a taste for fringe transhuman experimentation.
[81:55.84]Tell me about Hush.
[81:56.74]It's the Matrix.
[81:57.78]A former cyber terrorist for the Ministry of State Security in Kedan Yang, who fled his country after one of the Po regime's periodic purges.
[82:06.37]He made a career doing cybersecurity for dark web deplorables, human traffickers, organ harvesters, scum like him with no code or conscience.
[82:16.47]No code.
[82:17.85]ICA sure can pick them.
[82:20.13]No offense.
[82:21.48]Can you disable security?
[82:22.88]Whoa.
[82:23.91]A dual authentication protocol ensures any handling of data must be directly authorized by Hush and Royce.
[82:31.00]The proverbial human factor device to make the system impenetrable.
[82:35.22]Luckily, I found a loophole.
[82:38.54]If both overseers should unexpectedly die within a short space of time, the system reverts to a temporary failsafe protocol, which I can bypass.
[82:47.07]Take them off the board, and you'll have free access to the data core.
[82:51.87]And I'll handle the rest.
[82:54.66]Oh, just like the Romeo and Juliet encounter.
[83:00.22]In Karazhan.
[83:02.72]Yes, like that.
[83:04.26]Wink, wink.
[83:05.24]Both of us.
[83:05.66]I'm so glad I'm getting just massive minus twos.
[83:20.19]All right, let's go.
[83:20.67]It's on master.
[83:25.67]excuse me oh no I thought it was selected okay oh all right here we go neon city I'm ready mission stories certainty principle impulse control all seeing I'm looking forward to this one let's go I'm not doing master no
[84:05.15]Chongqing, China.
[84:06.84]This city is Big Brother's wet dream with more than 2.5 million cameras covering 15 million people.
[84:12.46]That seems... That seems like they would get stuck everywhere.
[84:16.93]It's pretty ironic that a cloak and dagger organization... Four of those would just be in your pantry randomly during the day.
[84:21.57]That'd be horrible.
[84:23.87]You'll find Hush conducting his fringe experiments in an abandoned apartment building.
[84:29.79]While Imogen Royce, the archivist, runs a day-to-day business of the ICA data facility.
[84:34.87]Okay.
[84:35.17]Sniper.
[84:36.56]I just hope you know what you're doing, 47.
[84:37.80]All right.
[84:40.70]Sniper.
[84:41.16]All right.
[84:45.82]Eliminate Hush.
[84:46.42]Eliminate Imogen Royce.
[84:49.48]Pack the data core.
[84:53.05]What do we got here?
[84:55.03]This is pretty level.
[84:57.49]They're very, very far away.
[84:59.05]They're very far away.
[85:00.71]Okay.
[85:01.01]Holy shit, this is so high up.
[85:14.22]And look, anybody that wants to tell me that says, Dermot, don't push her.
[85:20.79]She's only here to be pushed.
[85:24.26]You understand?
[85:25.70]It's the beginning of the level.
[85:27.52]It's just one person right at a balcony.
[85:30.48]They put this person here to try to just see who will push her off.
[85:34.44]There's no reason for this person to be here.
[85:39.77]Look it.
[85:41.93]Look it.
[85:49.95]Look, she's the only one.
[85:54.68]Alright, let's get... I want to get some intel.
[85:58.16]It's a very pretty map.
[85:58.96]It is.
[85:59.94]Ooh.
[86:01.58]Can I ride that?
[86:02.18]I think I'm going to go this way.
[86:15.85]Go back and shove her now.
[86:17.84]No, you can do it in your playthrough.
[86:25.63]I guess I'm just going to check out up here.
[86:26.99]Oh, wait.
[86:30.07]I can drop these.
[86:30.89]But why would I want to do that?
[86:33.04]Does this guy care that I'm going into his house?
[86:44.80]Laundromat.
[86:45.18]What's going on in here?
[86:57.25]Wait, what is going on in here?
[87:03.27]It's like just buckets?
[87:04.27]Do you go to a laundromat and like wash your clothes in like just like a bucket?
[87:08.22]Wait, I'm confused.
[87:09.14]Wait a minute.
[87:11.94]Oh, they're just not here.
[87:12.70]Okay.
[87:13.74]Any intel?
[87:24.70]Oh, well, sorry.
[87:25.18]Buy one.
[87:25.38]Buy one and let it come up.
[87:55.26]Oh, nothing came out.
[87:58.62]You're supposed to kick it.
[87:59.55]Hold on.
[87:59.89]Wait, wait, wait.
[88:00.37]Were you supposed to just boot that?
[88:09.21]You didn't get one.
[88:09.89]Here.
[88:10.09]Here, I can help you.
[88:12.77]Look, I know these things can be kind of finicky.
[88:15.60]There.
[88:17.20]Yeah, I pressed on lemon-lime soda and a root beer came out.
[88:20.24]That means yours was in the queue before mine.
[88:27.37]Um.
[88:28.99]Okay.
[88:33.08]What's in here?
[88:35.00]Sorry, I like looked at you for a second.
[88:41.74]Just throw it to her.
[88:43.42]Oh, yeah.
[88:43.70]Good call.
[88:53.00]Okay.
[88:53.24]Out of the laundromat, we're now...
[89:00.90]You up there?
[89:11.75]Opportunity.
[89:17.05]47, a guard patrols are clearly searching for something on the roof of the laundry.
[89:21.01]What could they be looking for?
[89:22.25]Huh.
[89:28.88]Why don't we find out?
[89:33.14]Is there a ladder I can climb up on?
[89:34.86]Is there a way to go up from here?
[89:42.81]What about this way?
[89:51.01]Come on.
[89:51.99]Interact with the keypad.
[90:01.67]No.
[90:10.38]I gotta get the code from this guy.
[90:15.40]What's the code to the door?
[90:18.70]Say it on one of these things?
[90:20.30]No.
[90:20.72]That'd be funny if it did.
[90:25.46]Ooh, what is that?
[90:26.22]Okay, there's like poison over there.
[90:29.12]Hold on.
[90:29.32]I just want to get him.
[90:30.12]I want him to come out.
[90:37.80]Wait, can I... Give me the iron.
[90:41.50]Is there a way to go up from here?
[90:47.10]I gotta get on the roof.
[90:51.90]Wait.
[90:55.93]Can I jump out when it's right there?
[90:58.47]Hmm.
[91:12.53]It's written on one of the laundry machines.
[91:15.31]Is it?
[91:17.21]Do I need to do that?
[91:17.85]Can I climb the pipe?
[91:26.52]Let's go down here.
[91:34.97]See if I can wrap around.
[91:38.16]I don't want to push him yet.
[91:39.18]No, I need to explore the area.
[91:40.50]What's going on in the noodle place?
[91:43.28]Noodle run, okay.
[92:08.29]That wasn't data?
[92:10.29]How is that not data?
[92:13.39]I just don't want that to be very loud.
[92:14.83]Hold on.
[92:15.09]Okay, that wasn't intel of any kind.
[92:23.32]But... Up there... Okay, I see a pipe.
[92:28.64]Let me get on top of the laundromat.
[92:32.67]Let me find a way up there.
[92:33.53]Down here?
[92:39.39]And then go up that way?
[92:40.33]He's drinking a Heal.
[92:43.57]Okay.
[92:49.98]Get on top of the laundromat.
[92:50.88]What is this?
[93:08.76]No, I already went up this way.
[93:10.08]How do I get on there?
[93:11.04]I think I have to jump out of that.
[93:12.56]This just takes me around the back.
[93:14.38]There's a loop, yeah.
[93:16.58]Can I hang from here?
[93:25.57]Can I get on this pipe?
[93:27.65]I don't think I can get on the pipe.
[93:36.34]Can I jump from here?
[93:38.94]I don't know.
[93:40.36]What's the map look like?
[93:44.12]No, I don't know.
[93:44.84]This is the laundromat here.
[93:47.42]There's a staircase.
[93:49.44]Wait, I think I might.
[93:50.50]Do I need the password?
[93:53.88]I think I need the password.
[93:55.94]I need to reload the whole map.
[93:57.12]Is that what you guys not fucking around?
[94:06.55]I was going to explore.
[94:16.02]Okay, I'm going to go down to this specific... What's the... I have to kill him in a certain time frame.
[94:20.56]Is that legit?
[94:22.50]Stealing her past.
[94:25.08]What's that about?
[94:25.88]You saw another one pounding her.
[94:46.97]What does that mean though?
[94:47.81]What's that mean?
[94:49.47]How did I get here?
[94:51.09]I don't understand.
[94:53.59]Is it just me or have they upped the crazy lately?
[94:56.88]There must be how to live like that.
[95:00.64]At least someone is trying to help them out.
[95:02.24]Where's the fucking intel?
[95:04.92]I think they helped them out.
[95:17.63]I'll do this one.
[95:25.18]Oh, put me in the experiment, please.
[95:28.76]What the hell is happening?
[95:46.46]This is my chance.
[95:48.28]Are we throwing it on sub only?
[95:52.22]Throw it on sub only.
[95:53.04]Throw it on sub only.
[95:54.62]Immediately.
[95:56.44]I just missed this.
[96:06.71]Disguise yourself as a homeless person.
[96:08.25]Right, they were talking about, like, the, okay.
[96:10.25]This is, like, kind of, I don't, this is, like, I don't like this.
[96:20.03]Why do I have to take a homeless person's disguise?
[96:23.80]Why can't I just say I'm homeless?
[96:25.30]I don't understand that.
[96:29.06]Why do I have to, like, take this guy out?
[96:38.33]Oh, shit.
[96:38.89]Fucking channel points shit.
[96:42.65]Turn it into emote only instead.
[96:46.80]Or turn slow mode.
[96:47.94]I don't know what to do.
[96:48.68]I don't know what to do.
[96:49.88]There's tons of shit going on.
[96:52.91]Alright, let me turn off channel points.
[96:54.45]Hold on.
[96:58.17]I wish everybody could just fucking behave themselves.
[97:01.35]I don't want to have to do this.
[97:02.81]But I will.
[97:03.39]I'm going to have to turn off the chat channel points.
[97:20.51]Sub only emote only mode.
[97:22.33]Holy fuck.
[97:23.19]That's like us extreme Let me turn this off All right, I just typed into fucking Google channel points god damn it I'm not ready for this right now
[97:48.78]Great.
[97:50.22]Hold on.
[97:50.58]Why am I on the front page of Twitch right now?
[97:52.76]I want to be on my own damn channel.
[98:00.09]Hold on.
[98:00.79]I got to fix this.
[98:02.93]Go to channel point.
[98:08.49]It's 160 channel points to chat with purple letters.
[98:10.47]I'm just going to turn it off.
[98:22.42]Okay, there we go.
[98:23.88]We're safe.
[98:26.47]You can no longer send a message in sub only for 160 points.
[98:31.95]Hooray!
[98:32.73]It's done.
[98:33.65]Okay, let's go.
[98:34.99]I'm gonna keep- I'm keeping it in emote only until everybody fucking calms down.
[98:51.10]Here we go.
[98:54.17]Okay.
[98:55.13]So I'm obviously going to take this guy's costume.
[98:58.35]I don't want to kill this person.
[99:02.27]I was about to do it right there.
[99:29.91]This is the worst spot to do this.
[99:33.69]What's in front of him?
[99:36.81]This is like the place to do it.
[99:37.99]I... No, no, no, no.
[99:40.33]I wanted to choke him.
[99:41.51]Like that was any better.
[99:42.34]No, no, no, no, no.
[99:44.44]Wait, wait, wait.
[99:45.10]Just hold on.
[99:55.98]Shit, what do I do?

[100:57.97]Ready?
[101:17.76]I don't know what to do with them I don't know I don't want to dump them over the railing because that's horrible and like I don't want to do that to this guy oh no but someone's gonna see him I have to take him this way

[102:09.11]I don't want to.
[102:22.32]I don't want to do that.
[102:23.68]I thought it was the ocean.
[102:42.17]Damn it.
[102:49.16]Damn it.
[102:59.26]Just don't kill anybody.
[103:00.37]I'm just going to... Oh, my God.
[103:01.63]I have to push her off and then dump him.
[103:02.73]I have to.
[103:04.05]What am I going to do?
[103:04.53]What am I going to do about this?
[103:06.27]I'm sorry.
[103:06.87]I don't want it to play out this way, but I need to... I've got to do this.

[105:06.44]Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[105:20.01]I thought that was a shotgun.
[105:21.07]I was like, that's not blending in.
[105:35.47]Why am I blending in?
[105:36.11]I didn't do anything.
[105:37.69]She has no idea what happened.
[105:42.74]Alright.
[105:43.08]I'm taking it off emote only mode.
[105:46.32]Sub only staying on, but we're taking emote only mode off.
[105:48.84]Fucking behave.
[105:51.33]All of you.
[105:52.07]Behave.
[106:00.26]I am.
[106:00.96]So I have to go into the homeless shelter?
[106:04.01]You only had to kill the homeless guy.
[106:06.55]Well, I didn't want to kill the homeless guy.
[106:09.65]Entrance to the homeless shelter.
[106:34.13]Kill, kill, kill, kill.
[106:42.20]You're wondering why I'm like level fucking six.
[106:45.71]Hasn't the game been out for like fucking two weeks?
[106:50.05]When does the game come out?
[107:11.05]It's going to do it again.
[107:11.67]It's been off for four days.
[107:15.29]Oh, well, whatever.
[107:16.23]1 1 0 1 1 18 0 1 1 18.
[107:42.15]01118.
[107:42.17]Nice.
[107:45.89]Thank you.
[107:47.21]That's intel.
[107:54.71]Alright, where's the entrance to the homeless shelter?
[107:56.55]There's an unusual number of chefs entering the restaurant kitchen in the middle of the night.
[108:06.96]Might be something worth investigating.
[108:08.12]Hmm...
[108:15.25]They're going to see if I climb on this though, won't they?
[108:17.25]Where's the laundromat?
[108:22.38]Up here.
[108:24.26]Hmm.
[108:29.82]How do I find the homeless shelter?
[108:30.88]Excuse me.
[108:39.20]The numbers, Jerma.
[108:40.13]The numbers.
[108:41.49]I could go just do that.
[108:50.07]Unusual amount of chefs going in and out.
[108:53.07]Welcome to Yuzhong District.
[109:00.69]What is this place?
[109:09.84]Why does it have a passcode?
[109:10.82]For what?
[109:11.16]0118?
[109:11.18]0118.
[109:12.68]Thanks, I'll see you down there.
[109:22.18]One of the restaurant chefs seems to have lost a note with an access code.
[109:25.64]What kind of a restaurant requires a code for the employees to get to work?
[109:39.49]So, is this a restaurant?
[109:42.29]Alright, so I have the code.
[109:47.83]Let's check it out.
[109:48.31]Let's see what's down there.
[109:57.20]Big doors?
[109:57.64]Mr. Pitchard, I can see you.
[110:00.44]Hi, I'm Emily.
[110:01.38]Pleased to meet you.
[110:04.57]I'll be your guide on the facility control.
[110:07.15]Spare me the pleasantries.
[110:08.59]I've had an awful flight.
[110:10.45]Nine hours delayed, luggage lost somewhere along the way, and the airline is trying to avoid their responsibility.
[110:15.37]I'm hungry and I'm tired, and I want to straighten everything out before I'm doing your job.
[110:20.72]Yes, so sorry about your flight.
[110:24.04]Just let me know when you're ready.
[110:26.63]Let's do it.
[110:27.37]The P-41.
[111:00.01]Get the P41.
[111:03.28]Back at the restaurant.
[111:08.42]Mr. Angus Pritchard, the visiting ICA board member, forgot a form in his apartment across the street from the restaurant.
[111:14.28]He needs to bring this to the facility guide before she can take him on the tour.
[111:18.38]He's going to go there.
[111:19.48]He's going to use the bathroom.
[111:20.88]Give him a swirly until he dies.
[111:22.22]47.
[111:23.62]Good luck.
[111:26.20]Did he leave already?
[111:30.41]Yes.
[111:31.03]I'll see to it.
[111:32.49]Oh, no.
[111:32.73]He's like distracted.
[111:33.41]I'm just gonna go over there now.
[111:48.30]Here we go.
[111:49.06]Let's go get the P-41.
[111:51.40]Dirty magazines under the bed.
[111:53.20]Stash of hard candies.
[111:54.72]I wish I had something juicy for you.
[111:57.04]But he's as straight-laced as they come.
[112:00.32]There's a lot of... Everyone just gossips about everybody, huh?
[112:02.68]B41.
[112:02.72]Throw scissors at the guy's head.
[112:03.96]You know how many times... Wait.
[112:05.42]Wait.
[112:35.78]Oh shit, this is the fucking door.
[112:40.68]Oh, this is his door.
[112:50.78]I like needed that info to get in here.
[112:53.81]Does he walk back over here?
[112:55.11]I need to, I have to wait for him, right?
[112:56.57]I have to like smoke weed in his GTA apartment before he comes over.
[113:00.11]Ooh, we got answering machines and B-41.
[113:06.46]What's the answering machine say?
[113:10.04]Hello, Mr. Pritchard.
[113:11.80]I've just learned that your plane will be delayed beyond the lifetime of the entry code you received for the facility.
[113:18.32]For your convenience, we've set up the new code 0118 to match the one for the apartment.
[113:24.06]Why would somebody be guessing that?
[113:25.31]Hi, something here.
[113:29.05]Wasn't some lady the... I'm just calling to tell you to bring your P41 for the facility tour.
[113:34.63]You forgot it.
[113:35.15]Thank you.
[113:37.61]This guy's talking from around the wall.
[113:39.55]Yeah, that was not a message.
[113:40.45]That person's in the room with me.
[113:41.23]Game volume.
[114:08.59]Right, yeah.
[114:09.83]Just some sparkling water is fine.
[114:12.19]So, do you... Oh, right here.
[114:16.39]Yeah, so I'd like to get some... That was perfect.
[114:20.85]Best part of the game right here.
[114:23.65]Oh, you got that right here?
[114:26.07]I love this.
[114:27.49]The crispy ones?
[114:28.99]Yes, those.
[114:29.94]Perfect.
[114:31.20]You know what?
[114:31.88]I'll get a double order.
[114:34.08]And a plate of the pork babbler.
[114:38.57]As long as I got to talk for the rest of the game.
[114:40.85]All right.
[114:41.29]Is this guy going to come back to his apartment?
[114:45.77]Where's this dude?
[114:49.70]Will he come up here?
[114:53.80]Because I have to swirl him until he's dead.
[115:11.81]I don't think he comes back.
[115:16.95]I was hoping I could just do it cleanly in here.
[115:18.29]Alright, well let's go.
[115:26.45]Disguised as the board member.
[115:27.47]Yeah, isn't that the guy that was just sitting at the restaurant?
[115:31.15]Restaurant?
[115:32.60]Restaurant?
[115:34.60]He's opened up a bunch of Zorn tabs on his computer.
[115:44.31]Save it here.
[115:52.48]How am I supposed to do that?
[115:58.18]Does he end up going to the bathroom?
[116:06.53]Can I talk to him?
[116:19.83]Yep.
[116:23.49]Yep.
[116:27.35]Yep.
[116:33.18]Can you go somewhere?
[116:33.98]I feel like something's supposed to happen with this interaction or something.
[116:38.26]Why are they letting me just go in the kitchen?
[116:43.96]I just like walked behind and went to the kitchen.
[116:47.34]Um... I guess I'm gonna- I'm gonna poison this guy.
[116:52.04]What are people talking?
[116:54.08]That is a calming bonus.
[117:15.70]Ceiling shit, no.
[117:16.94]I wanted to... Oh no, get me out.
[117:27.18]I need... Can I get him to move?
[117:36.77]In the bathroom?
[117:37.39]He's gonna go to the bathroom.
[117:40.43]Why is there rat poison in here?
[117:43.67]He's going to go to the bathroom.
[117:47.67]He is now.
[118:01.65]Honestly, I guess maybe this wouldn't be a distraction because I would just think whoever was in here was just doing a right into the water piss.
[118:12.08]Oh, here we go.
[118:12.48]Hold on.
[118:16.99]You don't hear this?
[118:17.59]There we go.
[118:27.71]Okay, here we go.
[118:39.96]I tried to close the fucking door.
[118:53.77]Sorry, I'm just I'm just kind of weird.
[118:55.78]Why is it G?
[119:11.79]It should be E always.
[119:24.45]Okay, I'm ready.
[119:28.08]Rebind it then?
[119:28.90]No, in principle I will not.
[119:39.39]Doctor?
[119:40.79]Doctor?
[119:41.93]What movie reference is that?
[119:44.13]Tell me.
[119:45.87]And I will mute for one full minute.
[119:53.94]Nope.
[119:54.38]Nope.
[119:54.72]Nope.
[119:55.10]Nope.
[119:55.48]Nope.
[119:55.94]Nope.
[119:56.42]Nope.
[119:56.94]Nope.
[119:58.41]Nope.
[119:58.65]No one's getting it.
[119:59.27]Muppets in space.
[120:00.91]You got it.
[120:01.21]I'll see you in like... I'll be back.
[120:02.27]I will.
[120:05.09]Thank you.
[120:26.13]Start a gas leak.
[120:27.55]Sorry.
[120:27.85]Okay, I'm preparing this and I put the poison in it.
[120:53.72]Poison the plate of food.
[120:55.85]Is this guy going to see me do this?
[120:56.81]You have to hit him with a comedy utensil.
[121:01.47]No, I don't.
[121:01.81]I just have to poison him.
[121:02.87]Is he going to see me do this?
[121:05.21]He might be mad about this.
[121:08.65]Find out.
[121:15.69]Now, hey.
[121:16.69]I got it.
[121:17.17]Take this food out, please.
[121:19.15]Oh, my God.
[121:19.61]Behind.
[121:20.09]Behind.
[121:20.83]Behind.
[121:21.25]Fucking God.
[121:38.10]Get that food to Mr. Pritchard, please.
[121:42.96]Ready?
[121:48.32]Take it.
[121:52.62]Take it out to him.
[121:53.18]It's ready.
[121:54.32]Thank you.
[121:55.46]Please don't eat that.
[121:56.78]Is he going to eat this?
[122:05.47]Two chefs come out.
[122:07.43]One puts the plate of food in front of you.
[122:08.65]The other one just has an apricot in his hand and puts it down on your plate.
[122:22.19]Oh god, I don't feel so good.
[122:24.79]That was instant.
[122:46.30]Swirly time!
[123:00.56]Hey, and here's dessert.
[123:04.07]You fucking idiot.
[123:19.16]Dump him.
[123:24.44]We're good.
[123:25.54]It's time to go do the tour.
[123:33.43]Nice 1080.
[123:34.37]I know.
[123:34.63]Go ahead and keep making fun of me.
[123:36.56]It infuriates me too.
[123:39.88]Are you hungry, sir?
[123:44.00]Yes, I was very hungry.
[123:45.22]Until I ate the food from your restaurant.
[123:51.05]Not hungry anymore.
[123:51.83]Hoimei, could you check my desk for me?
[123:55.23]I can't remember if I closed the file on it and I don't want it to be just laying there.
[124:01.62]That's rude.
[124:02.16]I just think I just puked.
[124:03.80]Well, I poisoned it, but still.
[124:07.34]Hello!
[124:07.60]Nope.
[124:09.58]I did.
[124:09.80]Okay, good.
[124:27.14]Let's continue the tour.
[124:28.58]Continue, you may say.
[124:30.68]We haven't even started the tour yet.
[124:33.20]But we have.
[124:34.50]Without you even noticing it, Mr. Pritchard.
[124:37.31]Really?
[124:37.69]If the facility is the best security there is.
[124:40.69]You see, the rest is, in fact, a front that lets all- Listen, break, please.
[124:46.13]Why?
[124:48.33]Who notices a dumpling cook on his way to work?
[124:51.21]Oh, that's what this is.
[124:52.17]It's a secret.
[124:52.87]It takes you a long way.
[124:54.36]Oh, I know the password.
[124:56.33]It's 0118.
[124:56.51]See?
[124:56.75]I know the password.
[124:57.89]Yeah, I knew it was 0118.
[124:58.71]I'm pretty good at guessing.
[124:59.47]It doesn't look like much, does it?
[125:23.10]no this is why it's cement everywhere I can't wait oh there's the big reveal welcome please report to security desk for visitor sign in will do
[125:34.52]I love the facility AI.
[125:36.64]It's really looking out for us.
[125:38.54]And we're in.
[125:39.48]The inside is a self-contained modular build that can be disassembled and removed in less than 12 hours if we are compromised.
[125:47.58]No trace we will ever hear.
[125:49.38]I agree.
[125:51.14]Leaving no trace behind is the only sensible MO.
[125:54.56]The outside shell is a building marked for demolition.
[125:57.74]We've put a hold on it with city planning.
[126:00.23]A deliberate misplacement of the order.
[126:03.03]But have people in place to rectify that.
[126:06.49]At first shift, city construction will move in.
[126:10.81]Our policy around ICA personnel is that they are a resource, but also a risk.
[126:16.34]On top of contractual repercussions if breaches occur, we perform detailed vetting on every...
[126:24.21]You can use your camera to hack that panel.
[126:28.65]I'm just like taking pictures of everything.
[126:32.12]Hello, sir.
[126:55.58]P41.
[126:55.76]How do I give it to you?
[126:58.06]Procedure?
[126:58.72]Okay.
[126:59.02]Oh, I should probably put the gun down.
[127:00.22]Alright, let me take a look around first.
[127:25.61]There's no way you're getting through that door 47.
[127:28.07]It only opens for people with an authentic security clearance.
[127:31.13]The signal is encrypted.
[127:32.13]Without a dongle, we can't hack it.
[127:34.17]Did you see?
[127:35.13]Did you see on your camera?
[127:36.73]Did you see?
[127:37.19]I hope you did.
[127:39.63]Of course I got it.
[127:44.90]Here's the B41.
[127:45.38]Please start the authentication process for top security clearance and engage the zero protocol.
[127:55.27]I'll get right on it.
[127:59.82]Jesus.
[128:01.36]Oh, goddamn.
[128:01.90]This guy's on a fucking cell phone.
[128:03.34]Of course he's not going to pay attention.
[128:06.26]Wait.
[128:06.66]That means I can just walk by him.
[128:33.27]Why her?
[128:34.27]Because I was trying to run out the door and she was in the way.
[128:50.22]Tier 1 access dongle?
[128:51.76]I don't know if he's being here anymore.
[128:53.14]I got an access dongle.
[128:58.15]Holy shit, I got an access dongle.
[129:00.45]A dongle provides Olivia with the encryption key needed to hack Axis Tier 1 RFID panels.
[129:08.41]I gotta hide my gun.
[129:17.80]I guess that blocks out the view?
[129:19.62]Security protocol overruled.
[129:30.56]Security protocol overruled.
[129:32.72]I can open up all the doors.
[129:33.96]Wait, can I open up the door behind them?
[129:37.06]God, that would be funny.
[129:38.60]No, don't first me yet.
[129:39.22]I'm not ready.
[129:40.06]I have a gun on me.
[129:51.91]I'm just fucking with their house.
[129:55.42]Server room.
[129:57.73]What's in here?
[129:59.41]What is this?
[130:00.01]Is a vent into this room?
[130:08.53]Okay, hold on.
[130:09.03]Cool.
[130:09.21]This is cool.
[130:09.59]I like hacking stuff.
[130:14.19]This is way cooler than the 15 Watch Dogs Allegiance missions that I played.
[130:19.49]Where it was the same two missions back and forth.
[130:25.37]What's this?
[130:28.85]Package.
[130:29.86]I'll take it.
[130:30.18]I don't even know what it is.
[130:30.76]I'll take it though.
[130:31.82]Alright, I gotta put a gun away.
[130:32.78]Alright, we're gonna conceal the gun.
[130:38.68]Do I have anything else illegal?
[130:43.50]Oh, what the fuck, man?
[130:46.65]Okay, I have a lot of illegal items.
[130:58.48]How do you drop stuff?
[130:59.50]F?
[130:59.72]G?
[131:00.60]L?
[131:07.44]Z?
[131:07.68]Alright.
[131:12.13]I have no more illegal items, right?
[131:13.39]I kind of want to get frisked while I hold a meaty bone in my hand.
[131:28.50]Yeah, sorry.
[131:28.98]I just got back from Disneyland.
[131:30.30]Have you had one of these?
[131:32.18]Have you had one of these yet?
[131:33.20]By the way, those things are gross.
[131:50.57]Oh, the gigantic turkey leg.
[131:52.75]Those things are disgusting.
[131:53.51]I hate them.
[131:54.23]Who wants to eat that?
[131:54.85]They're terrible.
[131:55.89]They get cold and shit.
[131:57.17]You bite like two bites off of it and it's cold in five to ten minutes.
[131:59.79]You're walking around like outside.
[132:00.75]It's really like stringy meat.
[132:03.71]It's just like a meme.
[132:04.71]I don't know.
[132:05.11]They're not even, they're not good.
[132:06.21]Don't order those.
[132:09.25]Go get the Mickey Mouse ears.
[132:10.85]Chocolate bar.
[132:15.49]Okay.
[132:15.65]Can I close this window?
[132:24.38]Good, you're here.
[132:25.78]I am here.
[132:28.34]It will take a little while since you're covered by the Xero protocol.
[132:32.31]All your data will be encrypted and inaccessible without your authorization.
[132:37.95]Access granted.
[132:38.75]Only facility AI will use it for ID analysis.
[132:42.23]Fully anonymized, of course.
[132:44.14]But we can do a few more steps on the tour while it's validating.
[132:48.68]ID analysis?
[132:50.20]What the hell does that mean?
[132:52.28]Give me a minute.
[132:53.08]I'll try to find out.
[133:00.36]Nothing in here to take.
[133:01.00]Something.
[133:01.30]Something to take.
[133:02.20]Chloroform.
[133:07.16]And... An access dongle.
[133:22.27]Caught.
[133:22.69]Let's continue.
[133:28.16]I'm just so annoying.
[133:31.65]This is probably what it was like to be a hotel concierge and deal with the rock bands that came in back in the 80s.
[133:41.39]This is the type of obnoxious shit they probably had to deal with.
[133:43.64]Intel.
[134:05.29]The ISA facility has top level security because of the highly stressful nature of the job.
[134:09.29]Employees are put through mandatory checkups on a regular basis.
[134:12.56]Additionally, they are being monitored for elevated stress levels and other risk factors while in the workplace.
[134:19.46]Will they scan my barcode?
[134:29.51]I'm sorry, but we can't proceed beyond this room until your security clearance is finalized.
[134:35.10]So, why don't you have a little look around while we wait, Mr. Pritchard?
[134:38.88]It should be here.
[134:40.78]Shortly.
[134:42.58]Shit.
[134:43.76]We need to intercept that 47, or the facility AI will blow your cover.
[134:47.90]They'll blow me up.
[134:48.42]Get into one of those computers and do it fast.
[134:50.40]Computer.
[134:50.90]You've got 60 seconds before all hell breaks loose.
[134:53.02]I have 60 seconds to get into a computer?
[134:54.60]What do you mean 60?
[134:55.98]Hack this one.
[134:57.62]Wait.
[134:58.32]Don't look at me.
[135:00.18]security protocol overruled good I'm in I'm in and you're safe that was a close one you didn't see I was on your desk
[135:29.95]You are way too close to me and you're really freaking me out.
[135:33.83]Perfect timing.
[135:35.37]Your clearance just came through.
[135:37.26]Must continue.
[135:38.00]How many of these dongles do I have?
[135:47.66]Oh, mate.
[135:48.38]Mate, you see what we just did?
[135:50.43]Come on this way.
[135:51.67]Your floor is two floors up on the elevator.
[135:53.95]Maybe I should just go take a look inside of that.
[135:56.75]What we just did over there with the printer.
[135:59.70]What did you do?
[136:00.26]I signed my ass and I scanned my ass on it.
[136:08.90]Great.
[136:13.68]I just made her mouth closed do like the closed jaw teeth hit.
[136:18.42]They made like a loud and she bit her teeth together.
[136:22.64]That sucks when that happens.
[136:40.49]target profiles and of course offer real-time contract support if your chin gets closed too hard like it bumped and it's like you bite like that takes constant vigilance to keep safe we have a team of engineers solely dedicated to that task and on top of that we have a dual human authentication process set up all access and alterations to the source are authentic
[137:18.43]I'm sorry.
[137:19.65]If you get too close to the ropes in the wrestling ring, I'm going to push you over.
[137:24.31]I saw that coming.
[137:25.49]She was getting really close.
[137:34.29]Wait, that was the target that walked out?
[137:36.05]Oh my god, it is!
[137:39.11]Oh, good.
[137:39.37]There she is.
[137:47.67]Wait, did that just say attack?
[138:24.95]I'm gonna get you.
[138:27.71]Wait a second.
[138:28.59]Hold on.
[138:30.23]Hold on just a second.
[138:33.99]If I can, I pull her off.
[138:42.14]I hope I can.
[138:42.98]Oh, good.
[138:43.54]There she is.
[138:50.51]Nice to meet you.
[138:51.37]Yes, it is.
[138:52.23]It's very, it's wonderful.
[138:53.43]I've been looking forward to meeting you.
[138:54.82]Likewise.
[138:55.36]Take care of Posh so we can get to the core.
[139:19.50]Wait, I could have pushed him?
[139:20.61]How?
[139:28.87]Is that a grenade?
[139:38.06]I tried to put the gun down.
[139:40.32]Alright, alright, alright.
[139:41.22]Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[139:45.01]Can you imagine seeing that?
[139:46.29]The person you're giving the tour to?
[139:48.93]Oh, yes, it's very nice to meet you.
[139:50.67]Nice to meet you, too.
[139:51.61]Yeah.
[139:53.01]Over the edge.
[139:53.93]That guy's fucking weird.
[139:54.89]I don't know why.
[139:55.35]Excuse me.
[139:56.97]Mr. Pritchett, can you come back over?
[139:58.63]Just pulls her over?
[140:00.13]I don't even know his name.
[140:14.89]I want to remember this moment the rest of my fucking life.
[140:17.71]Let's go.
[140:18.15]So show me what's going on in this facility.
[140:40.54]God damn it.
[140:41.05]Don't get close.
[140:41.61]Don't get that close to the edge.
[140:42.55]I'm telling you.
[140:43.13]I'm like a fucking trapdoor spider.
[140:45.06]If you get too close, you're going to go.
[140:46.40]I'm going to grab you.
[140:48.05]She plug-in?
[141:16.04]We have a strict routine of daily core maintenance.
[141:18.76]Part of that procedure is a flash process evaporating all biological matter in the room.
[141:24.62]Can't do it.
[141:25.18]I thought maybe we could.
[141:26.10]Hi Reed!
[141:26.42]What?
[141:26.66]Mughead!
[141:48.44]Ha!
[141:49.12]Stand, boy.
[141:53.38]Turn around.
[141:53.85]Don't look at me.
[141:55.09]Spin around.
[141:56.17]Kill him.
[141:56.57]Don't kill him.
[141:57.03]Power is power.
[141:57.57]I just did that like an hour ago, but there was not an opportunity to do it.
[142:12.97]Power is the thing that gets you the thing.
[142:16.03]Doesn't matter who has the power.
[142:17.82]Someone will always have power.
[142:18.94]Power is attainable.
[142:21.00]And one of us will have it.
[142:23.48]We'll have that.
[142:23.94]We'll be powerful.
[142:24.70]No mess.
[142:24.86]No fuss.
[142:25.04]Low cost.
[142:42.57]Just how I like it.
[142:44.31]I've been working on a prediction algorithm based on a combination of big data analysis and micro-targeted surveillance of defining target markers.
[142:52.43]I have to pee so bad.
[142:53.25]My results are astounding.
[142:56.18]All this state-of-the-art is nothing but heavy, old-fashioned machinery compared to what I offer.
[143:01.96]Analysts preparing detailed files, dedicating days, weeks to prepare our contracts.
[143:06.98]Gone.
[143:07.58]Handlers and analysts supporting our operatives during missions, gone.
[143:11.85]Teams for cleanup and media manipulation in the rare case something unforeseen does happen, all of it, gone.
[143:19.07]I asked you to imagine that scenario, but what good is imagination when you can see it with your own eyes?
[143:25.65]I've set up a little demonstration for you.
[143:27.43]Is that where they kill me?
[143:29.69]Three employees, unaware that I can accurately predict their behavior.
[143:33.76]Accurately predict my behavior.
[143:35.16]Where?
[143:35.28]Oh.
[143:35.34]Interesting.
[143:35.86]Will she?
[143:59.70]Why is she giving me mission intel objectives?
[144:19.10]explains why he's always next to me at lunch at the top right you see alicia reynolds bright and very passionate about her job however also very possessive about her contribution okay my prediction is that she will try to disable the work she has done for the ica
[144:35.73]Hmm.
[144:35.93]Hmm.
[144:56.90]Only two of us in here.
[144:57.94]There's only two of you.
[144:58.60]Huh.
[144:58.68]Sure.
[144:58.78]Use terminal.
[144:59.29]Who are we going to fire?
[145:28.35]Aaron Reid.
[145:28.89]This is disabled.
[145:33.17]Jeremy Bolt or Alicia Reynolds.
[145:36.51]Disabled safety mechanism.
[145:38.47]Performs core maintenance.
[145:39.71]Disabled safety.
[145:40.59]Uh-oh.
[146:00.91]Okay, that was weird.
[146:01.73]Alright, I'm going to fire Alicia Reynolds.
[146:05.69]We're going to disable the security system.
[146:10.57]Alicia Reynolds, I regret to inform you that Code 41 is now effective for your employment status.

[146:27.69]Don't mind me, sir.
[146:29.20]I'll be escorting you around.

[146:46.39]I regret to inform you that code 41 is...
[146:50.39]Okay Yeah, so I disabled the safety mechanisms and then I go do something

[147:19.25]I gotta pee.
[147:19.80]Let me go pee.
[147:20.14]I'll be right back.
[147:20.60]First BRB of the night.

[151:56.24]Okay, so core maintenance.
[152:00.07]Engineer.
[152:04.69]So why?
[152:05.17]Hold on.
[152:09.85]Bright and very passionate.
[152:10.85]If fired, there's a 98% that she will try to disable the safety mechanism in the core room.
[152:16.35]Okay.
[152:18.45]If fired, he will leave his post at the core room door to call his mother.
[152:23.28]Okay.
[152:25.64]If fired, she will finish her most critical task before leaving the facility.
[152:28.80]She will press the core maintenance button within 11 seconds.
[152:33.93]Okay.
[152:34.47]So we need to, so core maintenance.
[152:41.60]So we have to go one fire, Alicia, fire, Jeremy, fire, Alicia, and then fire Sharon.
[152:51.84]Or fire, Jeremy, fire, Alicia, then Sharon.
[152:58.96]So fire, Jeremy, fire, Alicia, and then Sharon.
[153:04.35]Right.
[153:10.19]Cause we have only 11 seconds.
[153:13.72]We'll try it first.
[153:14.78]We'll try Jeremy, Sharon, Alicia.
[153:20.04]Jeremy Bolt.
[153:21.78]I regret to inform you that code 41 is now effective for your employment status.
[153:26.54]No, Alicia first because I only have 11 seconds.
[153:28.66]What?
[153:30.08]That can't be right.
[153:31.10]Code 41 is confirmed effective for your employment status.
[153:35.18]Oh God.
[153:39.12]Alicia Reynolds.
[153:41.13]I regret to inform you that code 41 is now effective for your employment status.
[153:45.34]She has 11 seconds to get over there.
[153:46.54]Thank you for your service.

[154:20.09]Okay.
[154:21.39]They're going.
[154:22.63]She got in.

[155:27.92]Disable Alicia.

[156:20.00]I thought I told you guys you needed to behave.
[156:21.82]Why are people freaking out?
[156:23.68]People misbehaving?
[156:26.56]Okay.

[160:37.30]Okay.
[160:37.60]I don't have a security clearance for this.
[160:43.85]It's probably bad.
[160:44.39]Yeah, this is a hostile area.
[160:50.45]Wait.
[160:50.81]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[160:53.26]I'm supposed to be here, though.

[161:46.29]I'm good.
[161:49.77]Active vent?
[161:50.31]Okay.

[161:59.55]Oh, shit.
[162:00.07]Okay, I can go out there.

[162:18.72]I got you.
[162:27.90]Okay.
[162:28.12]I think I'm going to go out one of the vents.
[162:30.38]I'm going out this vent over here.
[162:33.47]This one.
[162:33.69]Why not?
[162:57.06]I mean, this is a little strange that I'm doing this, right?
[163:02.22]But I want to go up.

[163:17.26]That was sincerely one of the most intense feelings.
[163:20.07]I couldn't stop.
[163:20.69]I couldn't move.
[163:23.89]That just came out of nowhere.
[163:24.67]I have no idea why that happened.
[163:31.34]Nice, Ron.
[163:36.72]Nice, Ron.
[163:38.91]Wait, didn't I say I was never going to say that ever again?

[164:49.31]Tier 3.
[164:53.67]Can I open the briefcase?
[165:00.96]I just get to be the briefcase?
[165:03.84]Man, I want to get in there.
[165:07.47]The tier three sub.
[165:12.35]Put a gun in there.
[165:14.45]Oh, I could put a gun in here.
[165:15.47]You're right, but I need to get over there.
[165:17.04]How do I get this camera to leave me alone?
[165:18.22]I mean, does it really matter?
[165:21.42]Does it matter?
[165:21.88]Not really.
[165:25.00]Hey, you need to drop the shotgun.
[165:35.69]Understand?
[165:50.27]Who threw a grenade?
[165:52.33]Oh, my eyes.
[165:53.57]Oh, I missed with a shotgun twice.
[165:57.71]Did you see that?
[166:02.94]Like, kill him.
[166:04.62]Kill this motherfucker.
[166:19.50]2.5 billion.
[166:20.12]What?
[166:21.38]No, that's bullshit.
[166:22.44]That was probably for just that particular stream.
[166:36.26]That was definitely for that stream.
[166:51.36]Did I get it?
[166:51.78]Oh, I had it.
[166:52.38]I fucking got too greedy.
[166:58.31]I got too greedy.
[167:06.82]I had to try.
[167:23.70]Fuck, do I need the briefcase?
[167:33.30]Alright, I got the shotgun and the briefcase.
[167:35.54]I'm good.
[167:43.91]Neck is tense.
[167:44.91]Yes.
[167:54.96]Too many conversations happening at the same time.
[167:57.11]Alright, I need to go.
[168:06.21]I got a tier 3 dongle now.
[168:07.81]I can go up to tier 3.
[168:10.44]Give that guy a brick massage.
[168:19.62]What is this shit?
[168:22.49]Brick massage.
[168:26.94]I thought that was a door.
[168:27.82]That looks, that's a door.
[168:33.05]That's not a closet.
[168:36.82]Alright, two.
[168:37.82]Go up the stairs all the way up to tier three.
[168:55.87]Does that mean tier 3, like, 3 deep or 3 up?
[169:08.27]That's 3 deep.
[169:11.29]Is it?
[169:16.42]Use the map?
[169:19.66]Yeah, it's 3 deep.
[169:21.28]Or is it?
[169:30.05]Will the emergency exit open if I hack it?
[169:33.63]Am I getting one guy?
[169:34.47]Is that real?
[169:38.59]Aww.
[169:43.54]It's plus three.
[169:44.64]Okay, I thought that that guy was a bad guy because he was red.
[169:49.12]I thought I was doing this.
[169:50.12]I need to go number three.
[170:00.96]Up.
[170:06.46]We're on almost to three.
[170:08.98]Where the hell did I... How did I get over here?
[170:10.36]Oh, shit.
[170:19.48]Okay, cool.
[170:23.50]I'm like... I'm outside the facility now.
[170:25.97]Is he in... He's not in the facility, is he?
[170:30.52]Is he actually inside the facility?
[170:34.68]He has to be, right?
[170:35.40]This is like an exit.
[170:40.61]Am I losing my mind or what?
[170:44.19]Holy shit.
[170:45.37]Oh my god.
[170:46.57]Oh my goodness.
[170:47.37]That's a lot of cameras.
[171:03.99]There's no one up here.
[171:04.63]I can shoot these.
[171:05.17]Oh my god.
[171:24.78]That's gamer moment of the fucking century right there.
[171:26.82]Come on.
[171:54.89]No, I need to kill you.
[171:59.42]Must turn.
[172:00.70]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[172:07.62]What?
[172:07.80]They make an explosion.
[172:13.41]Why did that explode?
[172:14.65]Reporting a possible crime scene.
[172:17.51]I've got a body on the ground.
[172:18.57]Moving in.
[172:29.79]What?
[172:30.37]Oh, it's a stupid drone.
[172:35.80]Get outta here, get!
[172:37.50]Get outta here!
[172:38.22]That was weird.
[172:44.98]You.
[172:45.98]Man, I'm on the roof.
[172:48.80]And nothing to report from here.
[172:50.40]Over.
[173:17.76]Investigating just where?
[173:19.64]Me?
[173:39.12]Get over here.
[173:42.24]Oh my fucking god, I-
[173:48.25]They don't see me.
[173:48.89]They just see his body dragging away.
[174:00.52]Imagine that... Are you... Wait.
[174:01.96]Are you sure it's a... a breach or is this just like a really hungry raccoon that grabbed that guy?
[174:07.58]You don't know.
[174:21.35]I got it.
[174:21.65]I got it.
[174:21.85]I know.
[174:22.23]Been right here.
[174:22.67]I thought the guy was going to come over here.
[174:24.71]Someone's apparently... Of course he is.
[174:48.82]Come in.
[175:00.58]Alright, there ain't anybody else out here.
[175:02.20]I'm good.
[175:04.80]Let's get trapped in here.
[175:06.82]What?
[175:15.32]I guess I'm just stuck in here.
[175:16.76]Okay, whatever.
[175:17.24]Give me this gun.
[175:21.89]Save it.
[175:28.13]Got locked out.
[175:29.09]Alright.
[175:30.41]He's over... He's lounging around in here.
[175:33.03]I wonder.
[175:36.25]Can I, like, get... Let's see.
[175:42.16]If I go this way, where does this take me?
[175:43.30]Is there anything over here I can do?
[175:49.92]If I go back that way?
[175:52.70]I need to go that way.
[176:01.43]Ooh, hold on.
[176:05.15]Oh, look at this.
[176:07.13]Save it.
[176:18.74]Should I sneak into his room and just kill him with a brick?
[176:28.86]Oh, I'm dressed as one of these guys.
[176:31.48]They don't care.
[176:31.96]Yeah, I'm dressed as one of these guys.
[176:39.15]I can climb up that.
[176:39.97]It works, huh?
[177:02.12]Okay, so I already killed the first person.
[177:07.68]We get a lot of Jupiters here.
[177:08.94]This is like Jupiter City.
[177:39.04]Who's this?
[177:43.88]I gotta get a disguise and go around.
[177:46.92]Disguise it up, go around.
[177:51.52]1920, right?
[177:56.69]Look at all these Jupiters.
[177:57.79]Holy shit.
[178:01.11]Rise up, fellow Saturns.
[178:02.67]You are one of probably 30 people that have done that emote in the last year.
[178:07.91]Screenshot it.
[178:08.65]Alright, well, obviously you gotta go this way for a minute.
[178:16.72]Gas?
[178:18.02]Oh yeah, gas.
[178:28.69]Did I drop the gas?
[178:32.78]Holy shit, he's in here.
[178:41.74]I know the password.
[178:42.50]It's 0118.
[178:49.15]Oh no.
[178:58.63]What if I just tap on the window?
[179:04.60]I could just shoot him through the window right now.
[179:05.68]Alright, we're climbing.
[179:12.49]Can I not climb this?
[179:19.45]Poison the ventilation system.
[179:29.32]He missed it twice?
[179:30.36]I did?
[179:30.60]What do you mean?
[179:39.43]Is he coming out here?
[179:42.74]I guess I do have gas.
[179:44.06]I could do this.
[179:44.68]And that goes into the room that he's in right now.
[180:13.12]Yes.
[180:23.39]No gas.
[180:25.93]No gas.
[180:30.90]The whiteboard germ of the whiteboard.
[180:32.58]The whiteboard. 2552
[180:49.04]How come the gas is not working?
[181:08.37]Come on, I did it fast.
[181:15.29]Test subject.
[181:17.85]Okay, I gotta be a test subject.
[181:19.07]What's this?
[181:34.72]Get him, get him, get him, get him, get him, get him, get him, get him.
[181:36.47]Anything can hide him in here.
[181:37.23]Closet, go.
[181:51.25]Pick him up and put him in the fucking thing!
[181:58.06]Good.
[182:00.56]Save it.
[182:04.30]I have to turn on the ventilation?
[182:05.98]Insert fuse cell.
[182:16.38]I got, hold on, I got intel.
[182:19.34]A manual detailing how to activate the sensory calibration for a Hush's therapy session.
[182:24.38]Get rid of your gun.
[182:25.64]Get rid of gun.
[182:26.26]Get rid of gun.
[182:26.78]It's not illegal.
[182:27.42]I need a fuse.
[182:38.21]Pearl bar.
[182:38.73]I'm definitely going to need that.
[182:42.35]It's a gun.
[182:43.43]What?
[182:45.97]I'm a security... I'm a security guard.
[183:08.15]Do I have to pretend to be a test subject?
[183:09.47]Okay.
[183:15.18]Let's do the test subject one.
[183:26.34]I have a package for you.
[183:56.69]Bye.
[183:58.45]Okay, now I... Why would they give me the opportunity to do that?
[184:07.52]Now I have to get rid of the gun.
[184:15.76]Here we go.
[184:16.28]He's coming up.
[184:16.98]Oh, they're coming to get me.
[184:18.44]Did I save it?
[184:37.86]Are they going to come get me?
[184:44.31]I'm ready for my treatment.
[184:47.25]Wait.
[184:48.41]He's in this chair.
[184:50.93]Wow.
[184:52.07]He looks a lot older.
[184:53.36]Continue test prep H109.
[184:54.62]Signal strength 40% confirmed.
[184:56.20]Test prep H109 initiated.
[185:05.70]Focus now.
[185:08.08]Identify defining moment.
[185:10.71]Prepare incision point zero one seven.
[185:14.59]He's like, he didn't... What happened?
[185:23.32]Really?
[185:25.42]Good, good, good.
[185:27.94]Don't get too excited.
[185:28.96]Just throw a tomato in his face.
[185:30.30]No, no, no, no.
[185:42.11]Identify memory marker 90.
[185:43.57]I mean, I can't keep getting away with it, right?
[185:51.40]Amplify.
[185:53.12]Link memory marker 40.
[185:54.50]He wants me to throw it in his head.
[185:56.98]Load suggestion.
[185:58.00]Motor control 44.1.
[186:03.49]No.
[186:03.69]Does that jog the memory?
[186:04.91]Does that jog your memory?
[186:34.37]I mean, I guess I could, could I just go and zap him?
[186:36.27]I can just overload his brain with just junk, right?
[186:50.61]Identify point of decision.
[186:53.20]Map.
[186:57.26]No idea.
[187:00.34]Focus in paracetamol.
[187:05.47]I want to overload his brain.
[187:06.49]All right, all right, all right, all right.
[187:08.37]Are we going to lock in and have like a battle inside of our heads?
[187:37.10]I see we have an R and E. Is there an O?
[187:40.19]I'm ready to give it another go.
[187:44.21]He's ready for you, Hush.
[187:45.59]He looks strong.
[187:48.89]Good specimen to conclude this phase.
[187:51.41]We'll get started once his delays here.
[187:55.64]It's going to be a mind battle, yeah.
[187:57.92]We're both going to be like... The test subject came to his senses, I see.
[188:03.78]Good.
[188:04.44]Sister Lei.
[188:05.68]Yes.
[188:06.80]We're a- Please.
[188:09.26]I need space.
[188:10.48]What?
[188:11.44]Sister Lei.
[188:12.68]Yes.
[188:13.78]We're about to perform the final test of this project.
[188:19.20]Here we go.
[188:21.84]Hijack the data.
[188:30.18]And keep still.
[188:35.99]What am I supposed to do here?
[188:40.31]Am I actually gonna like blow his head up with my brain?
[189:00.45]I feel like I was supposed to mess with something.
[189:04.37]Resist.
[189:31.39]Got him.
[189:31.89]We'll get nothing like this.
[189:36.02]Go to 100%.
[189:36.32]100%?
[189:36.36]You've been working too hard.
[189:42.36]With your condition, it can cause you real physical harm.
[189:45.80]Is the meter on the right?
[189:46.80]It's safe.
[189:49.61]Don't resist.
[189:50.27]You can overcome it.
[189:51.61]100%.
[189:51.63]Do it.
[189:51.77]100%.
[189:51.79]I can't save you.
[189:52.31]Continuing experiment H109.
[190:01.44]Voltmeter?
[190:01.90]Should I watch the voltmeter?
[190:03.28]100%.
[190:03.66]Let's go.
[190:04.04]Nothing.
[190:04.30]He is a strong man.
[190:37.87]Voltage is getting too high.
[190:39.05]We're going to 150%.
[190:40.47]Attack him with the soda.
[191:05.33]What the fuck How did I did it wrong
[191:41.30]Do I have to overload his chair?
[191:48.72]Because I definitely have to overload the chair.
[191:50.94]Hold on.
[191:51.65]That calibration unit in the other room.
[191:57.21]Supposed to wait.
[191:57.95]What?
[191:58.57]I was doing it right?
[192:01.03]Wait, what?
[192:03.21]You can't do it on the first one.
[192:04.57]Oh.
[192:05.45]Okay.
[192:06.47]Okay.
[192:07.92]Run simulation.
[192:09.14]I'm ready to experiment.
[192:10.64]I need to do it.
[192:11.78]I thought that was it.
[192:12.56]Like, oh, well, we'll try it again.
[192:13.66]I thought we were resetting his encounter.
[192:16.06]Oh, okay.
[192:19.20]I thought I needed to do something else.
[192:20.62]Come on.
[192:21.88]ADHD dumb fuck.
[192:33.01]What?
[192:34.49]Oh, Jesus.
[192:35.47]Hi.
[192:59.49]Good.
[193:00.17]Sister Lei.
[193:01.39]Yes.
[193:02.51]We're about to perform the final test of this project phase.
[193:08.55]Alright, sit down.
[193:09.32]Let's get it saved right before he sits down so I can just not have to do this again in case something screws the fuck up.
[193:15.48]Okay, sick, yeah, sick.
[193:16.60]Sick, sick, sick.
[193:17.30]Sick, yeah, sick.
[193:22.98]Take a seat.
[193:27.73]Ready when you are.
[193:30.66]100%.
[193:30.68]200%.
[193:30.70]So, um... We talked yesterday about...
[193:58.48]Going into a VR headset and controlling somebody else like an avatar in the real world.
[194:02.44]This is what he wants to do.
[194:04.41]Shit.
[194:25.10]Wow, you're paying attention.
[194:26.18]Ban that person for six days.
[194:28.85]Six days.
[194:29.49]In dog years.
[194:29.97]It's safe.
[194:31.29]You're strong.
[194:31.63]You can overcome it.
[194:32.95]100%.
[194:33.03]Do it.
[194:47.41]Yeah, that'd be about four hours.
[194:49.83]That's like an hour.
[194:51.45]Yeah.
[194:51.65]You don't even... You're fucking nuts.
[195:24.53]It's too much, it's too much, it's too much!
[195:27.49]Can you ban me for a little bit?
[195:31.89]It's a sex thing.
[195:33.29]Do not ban that person.
[195:45.12]Nothing can stop the blob.
[195:47.34]Okay, okay.
[195:47.84]A short break.
[195:48.70]I'll return with a clear head.
[196:11.63]Oh, you need to be the assistant.
[196:14.61]We need to get rid of... I thought I just took a gun out.
[196:17.20]Oh, we need to be the assistant.
[196:19.10]No.
[196:40.44]Increase the power.
[196:42.20]Increase power.
[196:42.88]Increase the power level.
[196:43.80]Increase power.
[196:45.26]Jack up power to way higher than we can allow.
[196:49.20]Tons of power.
[196:49.80]Put the power up.
[196:52.30]Jack up the power.
[196:54.55]Just wait.
[196:56.33]What do you mean just wait?
[197:00.85]Kill the assistant.
[197:10.62]Hi.
[197:12.12]Hi.
[197:16.63]It's definitely... I have to like mess with the server room or something.
[197:19.51]That has to be what I have to do, right?
[197:20.83]I mean, look at that power.
[197:21.91]We need more power.
[197:22.71]Power!
[197:22.83]Power!
[197:23.89]Power!
[197:36.10]God, he is dumb.
[197:39.02]What?
[197:39.20]What?
[197:47.24]Wait, is this the assistant?
[197:57.89]Where's the assistant?
[198:03.08]This is the assistant right here.
[198:13.84]You're pretending.
[198:14.86]He's pretending again.
[198:16.04]Uh-oh.
[198:27.64]Let me read this.
[198:29.82]Sister Lay has been pushing for Hush to go further than advisable in his testing, but his personal assistant has convinced him it's too dangerous.
[198:37.86]If testing is to proceed, that assistant might need to be taken care of.
[198:44.02]The assistant needs to die.
[198:55.31]So.
[199:00.43]We need the assistant.
[199:02.83]Give me a hand here.
[199:05.81]I think it's bugged out.
[199:06.99]Is it?
[199:07.21]No, it's not.
[199:12.15]Alright, so... Alright, so... Alright, so... Why are you writing that?
[199:23.10]You already failed it?
[199:26.02]The other lady, not the one doing the... Yeah, I know, but... Did I miss the opportunity to...
[199:40.63]He should have gotten up by now.
[199:41.47]This is a legit bug.
[199:43.29]Oh.
[199:49.17]Is it?
[199:49.41]13... 1936.
[199:49.45]1940.
[199:49.47]He's supposed to get up?
[199:55.37]It's not bugged.
[199:55.77]What?
[200:12.07]I think I broke it.
[200:17.06]Just shoot him and run.
[200:19.06]I'm not going to do that like we did the last one.
[200:23.88]Just shoot him and run.
[200:25.18]Okay.
[200:44.96]So, is it actually bugged?
[200:48.00]It's not bugged.
[200:49.84]Are people just gaslighting me?
[200:51.10]Am I getting gaslighted?
[200:54.14]He's literally supposed to get up.
[201:02.56]I mean, there's only three people.
[201:03.58]You know what?
[201:04.12]Let's just try this.
[201:13.25]He got up.
[201:15.85]Someone threw something.
[201:17.75]But who?
[201:22.64]How are you today, Sven?
[201:23.42]Right.
[201:24.06]I'm so glad you decided to go ahead with it.
[201:27.02]You know, you're going to be a part of something truly amazing.
[201:31.11]He's a genius, Hush.
[201:33.13]And this is groundbreaking research.
[201:35.73]This is supposed to... It actually did bug.
[201:37.21]Oh.
[201:37.57]He actually had to get up.
[201:38.61]Dude, it's so loud!
[202:08.69]Oh my god, that was the most brutal fucking thing I've ever seen.
[202:14.87]Oh my god, my stomach.
[202:28.49]Okay, it's time to do the test again.
[202:31.13]Good, good, good, good, good.
[202:44.90]Get the disguise?
[202:46.24]No, I have to be the patient.
[202:50.42]Wait, why are you doing that?
[202:56.30]Did I hit an enrage timer?
[202:59.60]What happened?
[203:06.22]Save, save, it's safe, save, save, save, save.
[203:12.21]It's good, just wait.
[203:14.25]I have to wait up here?
[203:15.27]You're going to make me sit up here?
[203:16.47]I have to sit up here and not do anything stupid?
[203:28.69]Oh my god.
[203:29.59]Are you kidding me?
[203:40.01]These people are going to wake up by the time he gets back.
[203:43.92]Just make some noise in the meantime.
[203:45.30]Okay, that's... Yeah, sure.
[203:46.94]What do I have?
[203:47.36]I have a meaty bone.
[203:48.14]Oh, shit.
[203:57.03]Don't...
[204:13.52]You want to know what the best part about that was?
[204:16.36]It didn't make any noise.
[204:17.20]I hit him with like the meat part.
[204:42.36]What's wrong?
[204:43.46]Is the gun?
[204:51.87]I couldn't fucking wait.
[204:57.75]I couldn't.
[204:58.67]I couldn't wait.
[204:59.39]I couldn't wait.
[205:00.11]I couldn't wait.
[205:00.77]I couldn't wait.
[205:01.43]I couldn't wait.
[205:02.83]I couldn't fucking wait.
[205:05.27]I couldn't wait.
[205:07.63]I'm going to take my hands off.
[205:08.79]I'm going to take my hands off the mouse and shit.
[205:17.85]Well, I did wait.
[205:19.09]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[205:20.19]Let me give it.
[205:20.59]I got to take some credit here.
[205:22.71]I didn't know that walking by this guy would make him immediately be like, hey, get back here.
[205:27.59]So I had to hit him in the face with the meat and I had to improvise.
[205:30.03]So I dragged him into the thing and I left the gun.
[205:38.59]I'm not moving.
[205:39.05]I'm not going anywhere.
[205:44.49]You were fine when you took a step back.
[205:46.89]Idiot.
[205:48.88]Don't call me an idiot.
[205:50.24]How dare you.
[205:55.95]That was my day.
[205:56.51]My day is going pretty well.
[205:58.75]First thing I see in chat.
[205:59.75]Doesn't matter what it is.
[206:00.63]Even if it's unedible, I'm going to eat it for dinner.
[206:02.25]What is it?
[206:10.77]Ass.
[206:13.63]No, the first thing was burger.
[206:16.35]Excellent.
[206:20.13]Hey, you know, a burger could be ass.
[206:23.04]It could be.

[209:47.75]Come on, now.
[209:49.85]Okay, I need the data core.

[209:59.59]I need to get you out of the building.
[210:03.55]Come on, now.
[210:05.21]Hush needs to take a break from tomorrow.
[210:08.85]I never see him eat, do you?

[210:14.20]What?
[210:15.28]Where's the guard?
[210:17.42]Where's the guard?

[211:10.26]Oh, is that the problem?
[211:12.41]Okay, did the guard say, follow me?
[211:15.15]Follow me, Freeman.

[211:48.01]Is somebody in the room?
[211:54.38]Follow that guy.
[212:21.21]Go back to preschool.
[212:22.19]Why don't you go back to preschool?
[212:27.87]I could be way better painted than you could be in preschool.
[212:31.95]They used to hang my shit up in the classroom.
[212:34.86]They did not do that to you.
[212:38.16]I would be... They'd put it on the table with some tape and it'd be on a table as a placemat.
[212:42.98]They didn't do that to you.
[212:46.16]Okay.
[212:46.54]I need that data core.
[212:49.81]Save it.
[212:58.25]Alright, so we gotta keep going down.
[212:59.66]It's all the way down.
[213:00.42]It's a place, Matt.
[213:06.86]Alright, we gotta get you out of here quick, sir.
[213:09.88]This is where I killed this guy.
[213:11.26]I mean, like, it's a perfect place.
[213:21.25]Done?
[213:22.49]Dump him.
[213:49.17]All right, let's get that.
[213:49.97]Don't do it.
[213:50.87]Wait, should I beat this guy?
[214:25.97]Don't pretend to be bad.
[214:26.93]It's not funny.
[214:29.07]It pulls in so many viewers.
[214:30.65]It pulls in the views, man.
[214:31.80]Come on.
[214:33.20]Did I need to tell you that?
[214:34.92]Of course I'm going to keep pretending in video games and falling down and stuff.
[214:40.40]Are you crazy?
[214:53.69]Is this a statue?
[215:03.65]Play a horror game soon.
[215:04.59]Uh, maybe.
[215:05.33]This is a very big level, isn't it?
[215:11.19]This place... I forgot that we were outside at one point.
[215:16.82]We were outside.
[215:17.76]It was not a... There was a facility.
[215:22.48]We brought a bunch of people alive in a room.
[215:25.28]In this weird AI room.
[215:26.52]This is a huge level.
[215:27.79]This level is a monster level.
[215:34.14]Alright, keep going.
[215:37.14]There's nothing special that I need to do here.
[215:51.34]Like, look at this.
[215:52.14]I forgot this even existed.
[216:14.20]Security's tight today.
[216:15.40]We can't let any of you guards through here.
[216:17.98]Are you deaf or what?
[216:19.68]Okay.
[216:20.18]Did that guy just say security's tight?
[216:22.12]We're not allowed to let you guards in here.
[216:25.84]Excuse me?
[216:26.30]I am a guard.
[216:37.46]What the fuck are you talking about?
[216:40.26]We're guards.
[216:40.90]We can't let you guards in here either.
[216:46.14]All right, well, I got to get in there.
[216:47.42]It's the same lady from earlier.
[216:50.52]Actually, are you okay?
[216:57.07]You coughing something up?
[216:57.93]What's wrong?
[216:58.37]You okay?
[217:00.43]Oh, just a frog.
[217:01.59]There's a frog in his throat.
[217:07.66]Well, I mean, I'm just going to climb this.
[217:18.65]Both of you go check it out.
[217:36.74]Sorry, sir.
[217:37.36]Got orders.
[217:38.16]Can't let you through.
[217:39.46]Sorry for the inconvenience.
[217:44.67]Anyone copy?
[217:45.67]We have someone in serious trouble.
[217:47.25]Could be an assault.
[217:50.55]I was trying to get behind him.
[217:54.23]He didn't go far enough.
[218:01.75]What was I doing?
[218:03.54]When I threw the fire extinguisher, I wanted to keep going so I could choke him over there.
[218:09.80]This is not Mafia.
[218:10.64]You're playing it like Mafia.
[218:13.32]That's a really weird thing to compare to be playing like Mafia.
[218:16.94]Hey, this is not mafia.
[218:18.10]What do you mean?
[218:19.18]Like a third person?
[218:20.36]What do you mean?
[218:23.51]GTA would be better, wouldn't it?
[218:24.65]Like comparing it to mafia?
[218:32.77]Free the non-subs?
[218:34.21]That depends.
[218:34.79]Are they going to behave?
[218:36.95]I need it to go like there.
[218:44.57]The guy on the right saw that.
[218:48.17]The guy on the right see that.
[218:55.41]Let's not take any chances.
[218:56.61]You go check it out.
[219:07.78]Oh come on lady.
[219:17.75]You gonna pick that up?
[219:18.71]I took out that can.
[219:35.08]Got it.
[220:02.24]Yeah, keep it real.
[220:03.02]What's up?
[220:04.58]Save it.
[220:13.90]It's time to get the data.
[220:15.81]Hello.
[220:22.45]Good morning.
[220:24.13]Can't believe they let me in.
[220:24.79]I can't believe they let me in.
[220:25.49]I can't believe I got in.
[220:26.29]I can't believe I got in.
[220:27.35]I can't believe I got in.
[220:37.32]Holy shit, cool.
[220:55.40]Gotta test it.
[220:55.80]I want to see if it worked.
[220:56.68]It's the same lady.
[221:05.35]Yeah, the same lady with the umbrella.
[221:18.58]Alright, so that's the exit.
[221:20.08]Don't let me forget that.
[221:20.86]It's on the ground.
[221:41.08]What is that?
[221:43.22]What is this?
[221:43.90]Fucking iron.
[221:45.26]I threw this over here, didn't I?
[221:49.74]I'm trespassing down here now?
[221:54.85]Does that really matter?
[221:57.07]Alright.
[221:57.41]I gotta become one of these security guards.
[221:58.85]Are you behind me?
[222:04.44]Okay.
[222:04.62]I'm gonna lure somebody over here with the iron.
[222:10.06]Right here.
[222:11.18]Come on over.
[222:11.72]Um.
[222:16.20]Something's wrong with that guy.
[222:39.74]I got him out of the wall.
[222:40.44]Anybody hear that?
[222:40.92]I didn't do anything.
[222:45.06]What is that?
[223:09.15]Nothing at my position.
[223:10.89]No, of course not.
[223:11.53]I just want to see if you're stuck in the wall.
[223:22.78]The Pacifier starring Vin Diesel.
[223:31.16]What is going on down here?
[223:33.53]Hello.
[223:33.67]Hello.
[223:38.64]Let's go this way.

[223:50.11]These two guys there.
[223:51.03]Hold on.
[223:54.29]The data center.
[223:59.63]This is the... Wait, this is the... Wait, this is the... Whoa!

[224:10.39]Please follow the grey line to security check.
[224:13.05]Thank you.
[224:17.63]You already forgot the whole map?
[224:19.49]Yeah, this place is fucking enormous.
[224:21.32]This is like the biggest map in Hitman.
[224:34.90]I gotta get one of these guys to come in here.
[224:43.58]I need to screw... Ugh.
[224:49.27]How do I get somebody to come over here?
[224:51.75]I know.
[224:51.99]Is there a gun in the trash can?
[225:08.36]Oh, shit.
[225:08.94]There's a gun in the trash can.
[225:10.38]There is a gun in the trash can.
[225:11.42]Which one?
[225:19.76]Who's this guy outs
[225:46.12]Get ready.

[225:53.33]Put your hand.
[225:54.15]He's engaged.
[225:55.25]Move it.
[226:01.79]Pass the blunt, bro.
[226:03.12]No, it's mine.
[226:16.41]This level is deep.
[226:19.05]Alright, so... Let me go... I need to get one of these disguises.
[226:27.02]Body found.
[226:30.26]Where is this body?
[226:31.07]I need to get one of these disguises.
[226:53.20]Which one of these is silent?
[226:54.44]I don't have anything silent anymore.
[226:56.34]I had to step to choke somebody's face.
[226:57.42]Damn it!
[227:02.86]They saw it!
[227:03.44]What is all this shit?
[227:20.96]What is all this?
[227:21.82]Wait, this is the gun.
[227:23.48]This is the thing with the trash.
[227:24.42]That's gun trash.
[227:29.96]Why is this on a gun?
[227:33.66]Gun in the trash.
[227:40.45]47, this is exactly why you planted the gun trash.
[227:49.59]Now I remember.
[227:50.42]All right.
[227:50.94]Now I'm going to go get the gun and I'm going to snipe somebody.
[227:59.12]Thank God you guys reminded me that I would have completely forgot.
[228:02.93]Here we go.
[228:08.81]Give it to me.
[228:09.45]Yes.
[228:12.45]Get all these knives and shit too.
[228:15.70]I gave myself an entire arsenal.
[228:24.72]Okay, here we go.
[228:27.74]The plan here is we're going to go this way.
[228:33.11]I just need a disguise.
[228:40.33]There's got to be one person hanging out somewhere.
[228:42.47]Just one.
[228:43.97]Wait a minute.
[228:55.57]Can I get in there?
[229:01.66]Wait, this is just the core.
[229:08.98]What?
[229:20.41]What about the lady up there?
[229:26.29]Good.
[229:26.79]You're alone.
[229:28.13]I'm sealing the room and dimming the windows 47.
[229:29.81]No need to worry about intruders.
[229:32.71]Oh.
[229:34.61]What about that person?
[229:35.71]Oh.
[229:39.58]What's on the ground here?
[229:51.92]Opening up the data core.
[229:57.21]Holy shit.
[229:58.11]It's not in this mission too, is it?
[230:00.15]Oh, okay.
[230:00.37]It's a cutscene.
[230:35.28]We're going to start Overwatch back up again.
[230:39.60]Send the word out to all the operatives.
[230:40.90]Do I have to escape?
[231:01.64]At what point does the lady that was looking over this go?
[231:05.51]I can't see.
[231:05.95]Somebody blacked out every window.
[231:09.37]Killing the past.
[231:09.91]Delete the files.
[231:33.22]Okay, good.
[231:35.80]I've set up a link to an information nonprofit site.
[231:38.74]When you press that button, it's up there and the whole world will know.
[231:42.26]There's no undo 47.
[231:44.52]This will shut the ICA down for good.
[231:47.26]You really okay with this?
[231:50.33]It's who you've been for so long.
[231:52.91]I make a choice.
[231:55.03]Upload or upload only.
[232:04.34]I'll just return things to normal.
[232:06.88]No need to alert them we were here prematurely.
[232:13.22]I better save this shit.
[232:14.62]I missed that.
[232:15.30]We're blown, 47.
[232:15.96]Give me a save point.
[232:17.86]I can hold the doors for a little while.
[232:19.74]Use the vents to get out.
[232:20.94]Go.
[232:21.52]Now.
[232:21.82]All personnel.
[232:27.12]Breach protocol initiated.
[232:28.60]Use the vents.
[232:28.94]This is bad.
[232:30.00]That means they'll shoot on sight.
[232:32.60]I'm gonna create some havoc, 47.
[232:34.63]You're gonna create some havoc?
[232:36.00]There's a photo I can take over there.
[233:06.38]Venting.
[233:09.42]Come on.
[233:12.50]Get in.
[233:16.33]Venting.
[233:19.37]Oh, I need some help here.
[233:20.39]Can you drop the gas?
[233:25.17]On it.
[233:25.89]Got it, 47.
[233:26.13]Oh, steam just bursted out.
[233:30.09]Can you turn down the pressure?
[233:32.01]Got it.
[233:32.56]Working on it.
[233:35.66]Those fans are going to be going too fast, aren't they?
[233:38.83]On it.
[233:47.53]Briefcase stashed?
[233:48.91]What?
[233:49.23]Who is that?
[233:51.59]Locate the exit.
[234:06.26]Warning, core overheating.
[234:13.20]Was that command?
[234:24.29]Warning, fire detected.
[234:27.41]Hurry up.
[234:43.07]Faster, go faster.
[234:44.05]I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.
[234:47.63]Is it going like upward?
[234:56.24]There's a shooting?
[234:58.52]I can't go this way.
[235:03.20]Vent song, vent song or riot.
[235:08.42]Hmm.
[235:09.72]You'll never catch me.
[235:11.06]I'm disappearing.
[235:13.00]Jump into the depths of all.
[235:17.74]Uh, I'm going to write the rest on here.
[235:20.68]How do I get out of here?
[235:36.33]Warning.
[235:37.89]I know, but how do I leave?
[235:42.05]Just leave.
[235:42.73]Is there another staircase over here?
[235:45.48]I can't.
[235:46.12]There's so many guards over there.
[235:47.16]I can't go that way.
[235:47.80]How the fuck?
[235:54.94]You have to kill.
[235:56.46]Just kill.
[235:57.36]Just kill them.
[235:59.51]I don't think I have to.
[236:00.29]Okay.
[236:07.46]Just kill.
[236:10.28]Kill, kill, kill, kill.
[236:11.92]Oh my god, one guy went there.
[236:22.95]Holy shit, only one of them went over there.
[236:24.41]Oh my god, dumb.
[236:26.01]Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.
[236:27.73]Come here.
[236:31.71]Are you fucking kidding me?
[236:45.93]Well, they're dead now.
[236:54.07]What happened down there?
[236:54.96]And I'll go this way to go up higher.
[237:16.46]Oh, it's Peter.
[237:20.22]I know I'm doing like a Peter Griffin.
[237:21.58]I'm sorry.
[237:22.22]Got it.
[237:37.74]Got it.
[237:56.01]Got it.
[238:08.40]We're out.
[238:09.96]And that was pretty clean too.
[238:16.80]I only killed- I killed four people in a row.
[238:19.16]That's it though.
[238:21.42]Let's see what kind of achievements I get for this shit.
[238:32.51]Got it.
[238:37.29]Boom.
[238:38.35]Boom.
[238:39.21]Boom.
[238:40.33]Boom.
[238:42.21]I'm going to get a lot of these.
[238:43.06]Okay.
[238:48.72]This is a lot of achievements, right?
[238:51.04]This is pretty good.
[238:52.10]This should be a pretty good score.
[238:59.00]40,000.
[238:59.10]How much is it worth for you when you kill somebody that's innocent?
[239:15.63]If you didn't kill so many people.
[239:18.25]Detailed score.
[239:22.15]Finally.
[239:22.51]Leveled up like 10 times.
[239:26.70]Detailed score.
[239:27.59]Flexible murderer.
[239:30.85]Zero.
[239:34.95]Why?
[239:40.73]Zero?
[239:41.19]You killed too many people.
[239:47.70]Minus 65,000.
[239:48.32]God, whatever.
[239:58.35]Hacker MK3.
[240:00.71]Oh, I got, okay.
[240:02.11]I got some cool stuff now.
[240:07.31]Cutscene.
[240:11.51]We turn now to the data leak bombshell causing shockwaves across the world.
[240:16.18]The so-called ICA files.
[240:18.94]The disclosure of... You win.
[240:23.88]Diet Coke button.
[240:26.20]What happens now?
[240:27.91]The ball's in your court, Miss Burnwood.
[240:30.47]I do have other candidates, you know.
[240:33.46]Most of whom have never tied me to a chair.
[240:36.76]You've seen the news.
[240:38.60]That was 47 acting on his own.
[240:41.56]He is untethered.
[240:42.92]He is unstoppable.
[240:44.36]And he cannot be bargained with.
[240:46.43]He will find you, Mr. Edwards.
[240:48.83]And I'm the only chance you've got.
[240:50.59]I'm listening.
[240:52.61]47 has one weakness.
[240:57.41]Me.
[240:57.97]Me.
[240:58.53]Got it.
[241:02.93]I got it.
[241:13.10]I saw it coming from my... I've replayed all the video games, you know.
[241:18.00]You just know.
[241:18.86]Okay.
[241:22.68]Mission accomplished.
[241:23.26]Let's keep going.
[241:24.58]Next up.
[241:28.08]A farewell.
[241:36.16]How many missions are there?
[241:37.16]Two?
[241:37.74]Three?
[241:38.54]Left in the game?
[241:49.72]I found something.
[241:55.17]Buenos Aires International Airport this morning.
[241:58.07]Now watch this.
[242:00.51]Harold.
[242:02.06]Trail ends at the airport, but turns out that a top Providence operative owns a vineyard in the area.
[242:07.94]Three faces were on that.
[242:09.84]Of infamous New York law firm Morgan Yates and Cohen.
[242:12.36]And that fucking terrifying look behind the luggage.
[242:15.64]You can barely see it.
[242:16.72]Fucked up.
[242:17.06]She's infiltrated them.
[242:18.76]She's sending a message.
[242:20.84]She needs my help.
[242:22.57]Could have fooled me.
[242:23.93]You don't
[242:26.17]Anyway, if you're going after her, you'll need to deal with the Herald.
[242:31.95]Her name's Tamara Vidal, former CIA asset and political firebrand.
[242:37.03]She's a master of surveillance and the Constance's most trusted aide.
[242:40.64]She'll have eyes everywhere.
[242:42.42]You won't get far as long as she's in the game.
[242:44.86]Why are you telling me this?
[242:47.12]I thought you were out.
[242:48.60]Yeah.
[242:50.28]Old habits, I guess.
[242:53.24]Anyway, I... I need to go.
[242:57.41]See you around 47.
[242:58.01]No.
[242:58.35]See you tomorrow.
[243:07.87]Rendezvous with Diana Burnwood in Mendoza and ascertain her allegiance.
[243:16.02]Plan it out.
[243:19.04]Smuggled items.
[243:20.12]I don't have anything.
[243:24.47]fiber wire or a snow globe no how about that's all I have coins or remote taser key hacker
[243:54.44]I have not used the fiber wire once the entire game.
[244:00.16]I don't think I ever have.
[244:02.38]P break.
[244:07.40]Collective P break.
[244:08.22]All right.
[244:08.44]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[244:10.29]I'm not sure I'm going to beat this one tonight.
[244:12.79]I'll check it out.
[244:13.53]We'll see.
[244:13.93]But I'm probably going to get to the point where we'll finish it up tomorrow.
[244:19.53]Just want to let you know.
[244:26.00]Because two missions has been about like four or five hours about.
[244:28.36]All right.
[244:33.60]Let's let the non-subs out.
[244:35.74]And we're going to take a pee break.
[244:42.26]Yeah, we're going to take a pee break.
[244:43.78]But just, you know, whatever.
[244:45.46]Be good.
[244:46.76]Be good.
[244:48.38]Don't fuck around.
[244:49.60]Be good.
[244:50.50]Hang out.
[244:51.46]And go pee.
[244:53.59]Go pee.
[244:53.89]Be right back.
[247:20.03]Okay.
[247:24.32]Let's do this for a little bit.
[247:25.50]We're going to check the level out.
[247:28.14]And then I'll probably stop.
[247:31.88]I like the idea of actually starting a new level in one of the last levels tomorrow.
[247:39.73]Let's go walk around though.
[247:40.85]Let's take a look.
[247:45.03]Mr. Green.
[247:45.72]There he is.
[247:50.12]Oh, look at that.
[247:52.14]Iron Man, but he is real.
[247:54.58]Iron Man is real.
[247:57.44]What do you mean Iron Man is real?
[248:00.32]Huh?
[248:10.89]He's real.
[248:14.23]Iron Man is a shitty character?
[248:17.67]Um...
[248:19.84]What does that have to do with fireman?
[248:33.09]So that's Diana?
[248:33.69]I'm going to find out what the real allegiance is.
[248:46.05]Because you're not an idiot.
[249:02.94]No talking.
[249:05.42]Oh, replay, whatever.
[249:09.69]You know what?
[249:10.09]My favorite Hitman levels are the ones where there's a target and they're literally right next to you when you start the mission.
[249:18.15]You could just shoot them right there and run and leave, but you shouldn't.
[249:22.02]What are you doing?
[249:30.28]Don't be long.
[249:33.58]Why is everybody being quiet?
[249:35.00]Was it the dot, dot, dots?
[249:42.46]Oh, god damn it.
[249:43.34]I... Why are you guys doing?
[249:58.29]Why are you guys doing that?
[250:02.90]She tried to jump to avoid the taser.
[250:04.30]Why are you guys doing the dot, dot, dot?
[250:05.48]I don't understand what's going on here.
[250:12.75]What's happening here?
[250:21.37]Who's that?
[250:22.03]Approach Diana Burnwood.
[250:26.03]No, there's no X. Guys, there's not even an X, so don't even...
[250:33.28]You got my message.
[250:36.32]You'd never get caught on camera.
[250:38.40]Not unless you wanted to be seen.
[250:40.87]So what's the play?
[250:42.79]He said no talking.
[250:43.57]Oh.
[250:43.63]You're not the only one who's been busy, 47.
[250:47.11]I'm this close to becoming the next constant.
[250:50.61]I'll be able to dismantle Providence from the inside.
[250:54.21]Only one man stands in my way.
[250:56.63]Don Yates.
[250:58.73]Oh, here we go.
[251:01.09]He's the top candidate.
[251:02.81]But remove him from the playing field.
[251:06.55]It won't work.
[251:07.93]If Edward suspects...
[251:10.13]I will convince him you acted alone.
[251:12.59]Retaliation for Grey.
[251:14.25]Trust me, I know what I'm doing.
[251:15.93]Poop wine.
[251:16.53]Tomorrow, Videl.
[251:19.07]She has eyes everywhere, and they're all fixed on you.
[251:23.08]The plan won't work unless we take her out.
[251:25.50]She never leaves my side for long.
[251:29.00]Whatever your plan is, I'll help you if I can.
[251:32.71]You're sure about this?
[251:34.39]As sure as I'll ever be.
[251:39.78]What was that?
[251:44.61]I just went to like DS graphics.
[251:52.15]Holy shit, there's a little big party.
[251:57.69]I'm not muted.
[252:00.53]Eliminate Tamara Vidal.
[252:02.85]Eliminate Dawn Archibald.
[252:04.15]Do not eliminate Diana Byrdwood.
[252:07.08]Do not eliminate Diana Byrdwood.
[252:12.63]My mic is not muted.
[252:13.43]I can look over and see.
[252:27.31]Muted.
[252:27.67]Liar.
[252:27.99]Why is he not talking?
[252:30.47]Okay.
[252:30.99]Let's have fun.
[252:31.99]Let's have fun.
[252:34.15]Right clap.
[252:35.29]Right now.
[252:43.43]yeah okay isn't this in the first hitman there's like a reporter outside ready pam three two one and for more than two decades new york-based law firm morgan yates and co has been among the most successful and the most
[253:14.65]Cameraman Shit
[253:37.97]I mean, no one's ready.
[253:39.98]No one is ready to be grabbed by the neck from behind when they're looking through a small eyepiece.
[253:48.00]It wasn't long at all.
[253:59.36]Okay.
[253:59.88]We need a fucking invitation.
[254:01.56]Ooh, she's in my head.
[254:04.82]You're in my- you're in my head.
[254:06.18]Okay.
[254:07.92]Here we go.
[254:13.81]Save it here.
[254:20.05]German, what should I play when the stream is done?
[254:21.65]Well, you'll know very soon.
[254:24.94]You will know very soon, because we're going to pick this up tomorrow.
[254:31.62]Probably start around the same time.
[254:33.22]Probably around like 4 o'clock Pacific.
[254:38.29]For more than two decades, New York-based law firm Morgan, Yates, and Cohn has been among the most successful and the most controversial companies in the United States.
[254:48.08]Founded in the greed-is-good downtown era of the mid-1980s by Kenneth Morgan, Don Yates, and Theodore Cohn, the firm quickly amassed an impressive... Jeez, can you believe these people?
[254:59.69]I think the whole world is their playground.
[255:03.49]Distract.
[255:26.68]You don't care about this?
[255:28.16]You don't care if he does that?
[255:31.68]What?
[256:22.80]I just wanna say, if you take a picture of me, you're gonna serve me revenue.
[256:34.87]I don't give you permission.
[256:35.77]X to show invite.
[256:50.25]And you are good to go, sir.
[256:51.93]Thank you.
[256:52.19]Thank you.
[256:53.11]You're welcome.
[256:59.60]Read chat.
[257:00.30]Read chat.
[257:00.80]What?
[257:00.94]All right.
[257:04.72]Yeah.
[257:05.00]All right.
[257:05.22]No, no, no.
[257:05.52]All right.
[257:05.80]I think we're done.
[257:06.66]We'll pick it up tomorrow afternoon.
[257:08.76]No, I tried to knock him over the railing.
[257:09.98]That's how you know I've gone off the rails.
[257:13.01]I thought the guy had a leaf blower.
[257:15.54]I saw the leaves down here, and I'm just like, oh, wait, it must be a leaf blower.
[257:19.41]No, that's a shotgun.
[257:20.85]Can I pick up the camera?
[257:24.85]Okay.
[257:48.43]I'm trying to take it.
[257:49.07]I can't.
[257:50.37]There's no indicator.
[257:51.03]I can't take it.
[257:51.49]You probably have to kill him.
[257:56.03]Give me the fucking camera.
[258:17.73]Place explosive in camera?
[258:20.11]Why'd he throw a grenade?
[258:27.17]Yeah, no, we're done.
[258:32.68]I'm just messing around.
[258:33.38]I'm just dicking around.
[258:42.77]Link, link, link.
[258:47.24]To heal the nation, we need Bionicle.
[258:52.21]Joe Biden is sad.
[258:53.25]He will not repay the debt unless you stop everything and play the Mata Nui online game.
[259:00.31]It's a free flash game.
[259:01.49]You can find it at Biomedia Project.
[259:03.59]I don't know what that is.
[259:09.41]Joe will clear half a billion dollars.
[259:15.07]That's a Flash game?
[259:15.83]Well, I can't play it because it doesn't exist anymore.
[259:22.79]Joe Biden.
[259:28.17]I'm trying to get... I'm going to try to make that Bionicle viewing stream happen.
[259:36.04]That was a wrong link.
[259:39.60]It usually is.
[259:42.57]Best performance pretending to be.
[259:43.61]Oh, this is funny.
[259:49.62]Is the award, right?
[259:52.98]We talked about this previously.
[259:55.38]We talked about the best pretending on Twitch a bit.
[260:01.10]Yeah, I remember that.
[260:06.11]And then I get up and I bump into stuff accidentally and like I can't see the audience.
[260:10.03]I'm like putting my hands up.
[260:13.23]I remember that.
[260:13.73]Alright, let's, uh, let's call it here.
[260:21.04]Let's call it at 420.
[260:22.24]Perfect, right?
[260:22.82]Uh-huh.
[260:24.86]Didn't mean to do that, but, like, funny, right?
[260:26.44]Everybody laugh at it, please.
[260:31.08]We'll pick it up tomorrow afternoon.
[260:33.34]I will finish Hitman tomorrow.
[260:35.88]I will complete Hitman 3 tomorrow, at least, like, the story.
[260:42.38]Because this mission looks like it could be pretty ridiculous.
[260:44.08]So, I'd like to see it.
[260:48.78]So, we'll see you tomorrow.
[260:49.56]Somewhere around 4 o'clock Pacific Time, PM.
[260:52.76]Mark it on your calendar.
[260:53.54]If we'll see you, we'll see you.
[260:54.40]If not, then maybe we'll see you again soon.
[261:01.67]When are those announcements?
[261:03.57]Very soon.
[261:04.85]I have one in particular that I cannot wait to tell you.
[261:08.55]Two, actually, in particular.
[261:09.53]Two of them.
[261:14.72]Thanks for watching, though.
[261:22.53]What time tomorrow?
[261:25.37]4 p.m.
[261:25.83]Pacific.
[261:26.21]4 p.m.
[261:28.91]Pacific.
[261:36.98]That's tomorrow.
[261:39.42]How about 3.59?
[261:40.16]You know, I might go, I might just do it at 3.59.
[261:50.01]Just because that one person said to.
[261:54.70]But thanks for the subs, everybody.
[261:55.74]I haven't really been keeping up with subs.
[262:01.76]I still just can't believe that this many people will subscribe to this channel.
[262:04.74]So, thank you, all of you.
[262:10.46]It's shocking that this many people pay me money.
[262:15.32]All I can say is thanks.
[262:20.12]No shit, it's because they wanted to be able to chat.
[262:30.87]That's not, well... I only turn sub only on for a short period of time.
[262:37.51]Very seldomly.
[262:38.51]I don't use it that often.
[262:47.60]We have to make you a billionaire somehow.
[263:00.04]Tyrant.
[263:05.38]Apologize for sub mode.
[263:07.21]Well, I'm not going to apologize for sub only mode because it was used to just, just chill everybody up.
[263:19.64]I use sub only mode like once a year.
[263:21.84]I'm very sorry.
[263:22.60]I'm sorry.
[263:23.17]I'm very sorry.
[263:24.03]I turned on sub only mode.
[263:24.91]Please don't hate me.
[263:26.51]I turned on sub only mode for like a couple hours.
[263:28.67]I'm very sorry.
[263:29.65]Please accept my apology.
[263:30.55]You accept my apology?
[263:31.17]You accept my apology?
[263:34.17]I'm so sorry.
[263:35.01]You don't, don't, no, no, we do not accept your apology.
[263:46.87]Well, then I revert my apology.
[263:49.51]In fact, I'm going to turn it on tomorrow.
[263:52.59]For at least 25 minutes.
[263:58.84]No, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[264:00.34]Good night, guys.
[264:03.48]We'll finish it, man.
[264:06.29]Bye.
[264:06.59]Good night.
[264:07.37]Take care.
[264:46.47]Thank you.
