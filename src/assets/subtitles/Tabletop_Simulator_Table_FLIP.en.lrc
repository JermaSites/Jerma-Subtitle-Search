[00:05.11]Cards?
[00:07.37]How do I... Oh, I'm like the dealer.
[00:10.39]You're like the dealer.
[00:11.73]Okay.
[00:12.85]So here we go.
[00:13.99]This is the cards.
[00:15.39]We're playing Texas Hold'em.
[00:19.49]I don't really know.
[00:20.57]I think this is how you play.
[00:23.09]Thanks for dealing the cards out to me.
[00:24.95]Okay.
[00:25.67]Alright.
[00:25.93]So I got a three, a Jack, and a seven, which is that 17, 18, 19, 20.
[00:31.87]And the ace counts as one.
[00:33.17]So I got 21.
[00:33.59]I win.
[00:35.57]I don't believe that.
[00:37.57]Can't just win.
[00:39.95]Is the aces worth one, right?
[00:41.83]Look, bust.
[00:43.13]Oh, damn it.
[00:44.19]I busted.
[00:45.53]This is cool.
[00:46.19]This is so cool.
[00:47.35]This is so cool.
[00:49.15]Yeah, it is.
[00:50.45]Look, you can actually see it all in real time.
[00:52.73]You can get a bunch of people just to play cards and stuff.
[00:56.05]This is amazing.
[00:57.49]Actually, you know what?
[00:58.35]I think this sucks and you're cheating.
[01:00.71]Get out of here.
[01:01.92]Oh, my God.
[01:03.50]How did you do that?
[01:04.73]I'm done with you and your dealing shenanigans.
[01:08.73]I'm going to another table.
[01:10.69]This is the great outdoor tournament of 2014.
[01:13.82]If the wind gets a little too gusty.
[01:15.46]Alright, we're going to play backgammon.
[01:18.12]How do you pick up stuff?
[01:21.14]How do you pick up the table?
[01:22.22]I don't know how to play backgammon, Jerma.
[01:24.40]Nobody knows how to play backgammon.
[01:26.00]Nobody knows how to play backgammon.
[01:27.46]Get that out of here.
[01:28.55]That was so loud.
[01:30.35]Two cats and two soldiers.
[01:32.95]Two cats and two soldiers.
[01:35.81]Why do we have so many units on the map?
[01:37.72]Yeah, I didn't mean to do that.
[01:38.86]I didn't mean to spawn this many units.
[01:41.22]I'll help you.
[01:41.78]I'll get them off.
[01:42.34]Get these out of here.
[01:44.10]Clear the units.
[01:44.78]Jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle.
[01:46.82]Get them out of here.
[01:47.44]Oh, it's like respawning them on the corner if they fall off.
[01:49.54]Oh, really?
[01:50.02]Well, then we'll just like do it again.
[01:51.87]Oh, look at that.
[01:54.63]Alright, let's do it.
[01:55.69]Let's make it.
[01:57.13]You have to be so careful, though.
[01:58.69]Like, this is legit.
[02:01.39]We are legit making something.
[02:02.88]And if you screw this up, you're in big trouble.
[02:06.02]And as I say that.
[02:07.10]You just knocked it over.
[02:07.96]As I say that.
[02:08.48]Gosh dang it.
[02:12.97]It's too hard.
[02:13.73]Oh, my goodness.
[02:16.29]What is this?
[02:18.20]They're, like, actually animated?
[02:19.36]Yeah, they're all animated.
[02:20.58]That is awesome.
[02:22.46]He's like, I'm slipping.
[02:26.64]Khaleesi.
[02:27.70]Dragon versus tree.
[02:29.72]Let's fight.
[02:31.24]The inch versus smog.
[02:34.52]We need ogres.
[02:36.48]More ogres.
[02:39.99]Skeleton knights.
[02:40.75]So many ogres.
[02:42.51]Vampires.
[02:44.39]Dragons.
[02:45.51]Bears.
[02:47.15]Get it all out of here.
[02:50.69]Big mistake.
[02:52.89]Big mistake, man.
[02:54.23]Okay.
[02:54.95]Show me the error of my ways.
[02:58.59]Just like toss it off the table.
[03:01.71]I go here.
[03:03.15]Thanks for opening up that lovely corner spot for me.
[03:05.93]Yeah.
[03:08.44]I can go... I'll do this.
[03:17.28]I was like sitting there, deliberating how I was gonna get a double jump.
[03:20.70]I know.
[03:21.02]Alright, let's see.
[03:22.38]Did my character attack the golem?
[03:24.84]Let's see, there it is.
[03:26.14]D20, roll.
[03:26.64]You have like a god who does 3000 damage.
[03:31.16]My character has been worked on since I was 10 years old.
[03:35.78]That's 10,000 damage.
[03:38.26]That is so cool.
[03:39.32]You can just like scatter them across the table like that?
[03:41.76]Yeah.
[03:42.04]It's like Vegas.
[03:46.08]This is like the first game I've ever seen where you can literally roll the dice, where pushing the roll dice button doesn't just do like a canned animation.
[03:52.90]But wait, didn't you say, I would like to play cards on the moon?
[03:57.52]Oh, now you can.
[03:58.65]Everything's gonna be floating around.
[04:01.25]What, did you just drop the gravity?
[04:03.07]Yeah.
[04:04.79]Look at this.
[04:08.91]Flip all of the things.
[04:12.59]That's so stupid.
[04:17.04]What what like is the miss why is that necessary?
[04:20.84]Alright, so we're gonna play cards we can play go fish watch this, okay?
[04:28.75]Whoo So now when I look at yours, I can't see what it is It's just a question mark because it's like on your hand, but when you put it on the table.
[04:36.93]Yeah, I can't Oh, what about and have it too?
[04:39.95]So like even if you're holding it over your name, it's hidden
[04:43.51]So, can you see it right now?
[04:44.91]No, it's just a question mark.
[04:46.25]How about now?
[04:47.11]Nope.
[04:48.43]Yes.
[04:48.79]How about now?
[04:49.75]Yeah, as soon as it, like, crosses the threshold, I can.
[04:52.91]That's really cool.
[04:53.93]So now, I can just do this.
[04:57.52]To, like, reset, and then I want to shuffle the deck.
[04:59.40]I just pick up the whole deck and shake it like this.
[05:03.72]Except for this card that I took out.
[05:06.64]Goldfish.
[05:07.16]Oh!
[05:09.74]How many cards are you supposed to have in Go Fish?
[05:12.59]I have no idea.
[05:13.31]I haven't played Go Fish since like the second grade.
[05:18.21]Okay, Jerma, do you have... Oh, wait, I have a pair.
[05:20.79]Hang on.
[05:22.97]Let's just play like... Do you have any nines?
[05:26.30]No, Go Fish?
[05:29.20]Do you have... Do you have any twos?
[05:33.08]I do.

[05:38.91]My turn?
[05:39.21]Do you have any sevens?
[05:44.98]There's your seven right there.
[05:46.70]I did have a seven.
[05:49.22]You did.
[05:50.64]I was just hovering over that for so long.
[05:53.11]I was like, should I just throw this?
[05:55.17]Should I just dump this table?
[05:56.55]Alright guys, how sick is this?
[05:57.83]Magic the Gathering being played in board game simulator.
[06:00.73]I can zoom in, see the land cards here in detail.
[06:04.33]I can see the Honor of the Pure and Midnight Guard that have been played here.
[06:07.93]You can tap the cards, you can draw them into your hand.
[06:10.68]By the way, since I can see their hands, I'm in spectator mode.
[06:13.88]The other players cannot see each other's hand.
[06:16.36]It makes it invisible.
[06:17.14]It'll look like this.
[06:17.98]I'm not sure if there's like a glitch right now.
[06:20.08]It is early access still.
[06:21.54]But anyway, I just wanted to give you a quick example of what you can make in this board game simulator as far as custom game types go.
[06:28.24]The opportunities are going to be endless as soon as workshop support is added.
[06:33.26]But right now, there's still a lot of cool stuff that you can play with.
[06:36.41]It just looks like you're playing an actual board game.
[06:37.97]You can see everyone's hands floating around the table, see what they're doing.
[06:41.93]Anyways, guys, if you enjoyed this video and you want to see more videos like it in the future, please let me know by leaving a like on the videos that you enjoy.
[06:47.63]If you want to check out Board Game Simulator for yourself, there's a link in the description of this video where you can buy it on Steam Early Access now.
