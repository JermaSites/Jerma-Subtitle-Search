[00:08.72]Hey, what's going on, guys?
[00:09.70]Jerma here.
[00:10.34]I want to welcome you to the 15,000 subscriber... I don't even know what you call this.
[00:16.44]This is not really a video.
[00:18.69]It's a video, but this is not a skit.
[00:21.29]Really, it's more of a real-life happening, I guess you could say.
[00:25.27]We have Burgah Boy, who's standing right here.
[00:27.03]He's pretty much naked, so he can't, like, come into frame.
[00:29.66]But, uh, just say something.
[00:30.60]Say hello.
[00:32.16]Hello.
[00:33.93]So what's going to happen in this video is there's going to be a Twinkie eating contest and then right after it is going to be a pie eating contest.
[00:40.57]Both between Burgah Boy and Exoskeleton Bug Millennium Boy.
[00:44.75]So bear with us here.
[00:47.46]This is going to be pretty gross.
[00:49.80]I won't recommend that you have like small children that are eating.
[00:52.66]If you happen to be eating something, I would put it to the side for a second because this is disgusting.
[00:58.86]So, I hope you guys enjoy this.
[01:00.44]I'm gonna be shoutcasting the whole thing.
[01:03.10]So we'll see how it goes.
[01:04.80]See you in a second.
[01:08.23]So welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the 15,000 subscriber video.
[01:11.97]I am Anthony Wimbledon, sitting alongside here with Grandpa.
[01:14.95]We're gonna go over the contestants for a little bit.
[01:16.57]Grandpa, first introduce yourself.
[01:18.40]I just want to say hello and welcome to the video.
[01:22.00]This is going to be a crazy, extraordinary thing.
[01:24.81]And these guys are gross, by the way.
[01:26.43]Can I just say that?
[01:27.63]I think a lot of people potentially are thinking the same thing, Grandpa.
[01:31.31]Okay, so first up here we have Burgah Boy, who is a longtime champion of the eating events.
[01:35.97]He holds seven world records for eating cheeseburgers, and he is on the World Health Organization's list of potential threats.
[01:41.89]Ladies and gentlemen, Burgah Boy.
[01:44.28]But we also have another competitor, ExoskeletonBugMillenniumBoy.
[01:48.76]He has been doing a lot of trash talking prior to this competition.
[01:52.54]All he wants to do is talk about Burgah Boy and how fat he is and how stupid he is.
[01:56.11]But we will see at the end of this competition if that's going to be true.
[01:58.99]So let's get down to the floor here now.
[02:00.63]I guess I'm getting in my ear.
[02:01.71]We're getting an interview here with ExoskeletonBugMillenniumBoy.
[02:04.89]He's got something to say about Burgah Boy.
[02:06.51]Let's get down there.
[02:08.02]The exoskeleton bug body takes on the Burgah Boy.
[02:10.28]Here's how I'm going to win.
[02:11.14]The Burgah Boy eats burgers, not Twinkies.
[02:13.16]Boom.
[02:13.58]Shut down.
[02:14.22]Wasted.
[02:15.34]Actually, that's quite a point there.
[02:16.52]Burgah Boy looks a little stunned.
[02:17.88]But what do you say we get this started, Grandpa?
[02:19.54]We're going to shellcast this whole thing.
[02:21.30]Get the countdown ready, even though we're not going to keep any time.
[02:24.58]That is really stupid.
[02:25.94]But we're going to start this off right now, one to one right now.
[02:28.46]Both of them shoving those down their throats.
[02:30.02]Burgah Boy gets the upper hand with two now.
[02:32.20]I mean, does this guy really think he's going to win this contest?
[02:35.25]This guy's like ten times bigger than you.
[02:37.05]Are you fucking stupid?
[02:38.35]Yep.
[02:38.89]You can't win this!
[02:39.71]You're not gonna win!
[02:40.53]You are right, though, Grandpa.
[02:41.45]He does have the weight advantage, and he also has the eating advantage.
[02:44.31]He has multiple championships.
[02:45.91]Millennium Boy has done pretty much absolutely nothing in his entire life, so I can understand where you're coming from.
[02:50.84]You know, also, too, you'd really need to take into consideration
[02:54.38]The fact that the big fat guy over there... Burgah Boy, you mean?
[02:57.02]Yep.
[02:57.60]Well, what, you know, here, Burgah Boy, he's a strong bastard, you know.
[03:01.73]He could probably pick you up and throw you.
[03:03.71]So even if he loses this fight tonight, he'll probably kick his ass, and I'll probably want to watch that, too.
[03:10.22]and hopefully the cameraman gets that on camera.
[03:12.86]That would be pretty interesting to say the least, but right now six to five and Burgah Boy seems to be losing his composure right now.
[03:18.70]Thought what he just saw was really funny.
[03:20.20]Yeah, he's gonna lose if he doesn't cut the shit.
[03:23.38]Oh, look at the side of his mouth.
[03:25.05]That's disgusting.
[03:26.67]Six to six now.
[03:28.01]Burgah Boy trying to find his composure.
[03:29.85]It is now tied up at the sixes.
[03:31.87]Burgah Boy now finds it.
[03:32.77]He gets one in there very quickly.
[03:34.21]Now seven to six, Burgah Boy.
[03:36.17]And something that a lot of people don't understand is Twinkies are an incredibly dense snack.
[03:41.64]150 calories per Twinkie and a ton of sugar.
[03:44.88]Yeah, someone's definitely going to puke.
[03:46.72]Oh, geez.
[03:47.28]If somebody doesn't puke, I will pay everybody six... I will pay a dollar to charity if somebody doesn't puke.
[03:57.86]Well, that's very noble of you, Grandpa.
[03:59.30]Very noble.
[03:59.80]But it looks like we're starting to see a slowdown here.
[04:02.38]Nine to seven.
[04:03.62]Oh, and listen to that.
[04:04.73]He's got some choice words for him.
[04:06.43]He's only up by one point, though, trying to get a little overconfident there.
[04:09.13]Yeah, he better watch that because I've done that before.
[04:11.91]It came back to bite me right on the balls.
[04:14.46]I said to some guy at the bus stop, I said, hey, can I see your newspaper for a second?
[04:19.52]And he said, no, it's mine.
[04:21.62]And then I got arrested for assault.
[04:23.58]And I'm not sure where that was going.
[04:25.50]But don't be mean to people.
[04:27.20]That's the moral of the story.
[04:28.82]Okay, that's fantastic.
[04:29.88]But now we've got 11 to 8 here.
[04:31.48]Both of them slowing down immensely.
[04:33.06]11 to 9 now.
[04:35.34]I think this is going to be the end here.
[04:36.54]They're both stopping.
[04:38.10]I don't see any more activity between either Burgah Boy.
[04:40.40]Oh, let's go down to the field.
[04:41.28]Let's find out what's going on down there.
[04:44.36]The brick wall is there.
[04:46.94]Heard it from Burgah Boy himself, hitting the brick wall.
[04:49.48]Both of them are now conceding this match.
[04:51.74]It is 11-9.
[04:52.76]Burgah Boy is your victor.
[04:54.11]I mean, is that really a surprise to anybody that's watching this right now?
[04:58.03]Probably not, but let's go down to Jeremy, a.k.a.
[05:00.85]me, and I'll announce the winner.
[05:04.96]So, ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the Twinkie Eating Competition, Burgah Boy!
[05:11.10]Woo-hoo!
[05:13.02]I missed it!
[05:15.46]That's why I said you film it.
[05:19.49]I didn't know you were going to do that either.
[05:21.31]What did you just do?
[05:22.03]I thought you were going to wait.
[05:25.27]So this is gonna be just a bonus clip.
[05:27.09]They decided to do a pie-eating contest as well.
[05:30.04]And as you can see here, they're both just disgusting human beings, eating like a pig out of a trough.
[05:35.58]And Burgah Boy starts off very, very well, but Exoskeleton Bug Millennium Boy does pretty well.
[05:39.80]He keeps up pretty much the whole time.
[05:41.79]We're going to go in for some live stuff in a second here, but I just want to take this opportunity to thank every single person that has subscribed to the channel.
[05:49.61]15,000 subscribers is mind-boggling, guys.
[05:52.61]So thank you all so, so much.
[05:54.15]It means a hell of a lot to me.
[05:55.77]You guys rock everybody.
[05:57.99]So take care, guys.
[05:59.25]I'll see you all soon, and I'll leave you with the ending.
[06:01.99]It was pretty funny.
[06:02.73]So here's the ending of the pie-eating contest.
[06:06.38]Take care, everybody.
[06:10.38]The crust is like stuck to the bottom.
[06:13.02]Rape it.
[06:14.92]Rape it?
[06:18.16]Scrape it.
[06:18.92]Scrape it.
[06:20.76]Oh fuck, I'm losing my shit.
[06:27.23]Oh man.
[06:31.53]Your winner, again, Burgah Boy.
[06:40.06]Oh, I won a pie eating contest when I was like a kid.
[06:43.04]At like summer camp.
[06:44.63]Everyone was like, oh, I didn't eat all day.
[06:46.47]Even like all the fat kids.
[06:48.05]And then, oh, I won.
[06:49.49]I beat them all.
[06:50.11]I was like a little guy.
[06:51.87]Oh, what happened now?
[06:53.59]You lost!
