[00:01.57]Hey, what's going on guys?
[00:02.97]Method Gaming to be exact.
[00:04.73]My name is Jerma.
[00:05.61]You know the deal.
[00:06.55]This is Team Fortress 2.
[00:07.69]Gonna do it live because a lot of you guys asked for more live Team Fortress 2.
[00:12.89]So I'm gonna fulfill your request and play some Medic.
[00:16.83]This is on CP Gully Wash.
[00:19.31]Somewhat of a new map.
[00:21.26]And it's a very, very fun map.
[00:22.68]I'm glad that they added it to the official rotation.
[00:24.60]And oh my god, a heavy...
[00:28.63]Well, that didn't go well, the initial start.
[00:31.74]Anyway, I hope you guys are all having a fantastic holiday.
[00:34.68]If you celebrate Thanksgiving, happy Thanksgiving.
[00:37.48]And if you don't celebrate Thanksgiving and have no idea what I'm talking about, then disregard this message.
[00:42.45]I'm going to go on the... No, I'm not going to go on the teleporter.
[00:46.79]Using the Kritzkrieg, the Amputator, and the Crusader's Crossbow...
[00:51.76]When you put these three things on, you get extra health per second added on to what you normally get as a medic.
[00:57.18]So it's very, very cool.
[00:59.04]We gotta... Oh, God.
[01:01.16]Come on, get him.
[01:01.82]Get him, Labros.
[01:04.28]I'm gonna get killed.
[01:05.46]Anybody coming behind us?
[01:07.53]Oh, I just barely didn't get that Pyro.
[01:10.25]I gotta back up.
[01:12.25]Medic tip, if you are outnumbered... Give me the health.
[01:16.07]If you are outnumbered and... Oh, my God.
[01:20.39]Let's see if I can get this sentence out before freaking out.
[01:23.21]If you are outnumbered, then do not get yourself into trouble.
[01:27.44]Turn around and run away because you don't want to lose your ubercharge.
[01:30.64]If you get killed, let's say it's like three on one.
[01:32.90]Like it's like me, this guy versus like four people.
[01:35.86]Do no, no, no, no.
[01:39.02]Do not get yourself into trouble.
[01:40.86]I almost have a crit screen.
[01:41.75]Come on.
[01:43.81]All I need is a crit screen.
[01:45.31]Go to overheal all these people.
[01:46.87]No!
[01:47.33]No!
[01:47.83]No!
[01:48.49]Get off of here!
[01:49.37]Get out of here!
[01:50.93]Did I did it?
[01:51.53]I did it.
[01:51.87]He's not dead.
[01:52.47]He's not dead.
[01:53.23]Get on the point!
[01:54.13]Oh my god, people!
[01:55.47]Does it really take a medic to do... I had a... Come on now, guys.
[02:01.63]Come on now.
[02:05.24]It takes a medic to jump on the point and start swinging.
[02:08.76]Technically, I probably should have stayed on there, but I had an 100% ubercharge and kill... Yeah, that was just a bad situation.
[02:16.21]Okay, so we got that out of our system.
[02:19.07]Let's not have that happen again.
[02:20.25]Alright, Mick or Mike.
[02:26.82]Whatever you want to be called.
[02:27.68]I think it's Mike.
[02:30.57]Overheal these people.
[02:32.01]Another medic tip if you are not familiar.
[02:33.79]You gotta overheal people, guys.
[02:36.23]Overheal you can only do with the regular Uber Charge gun or the Kritzkrieg.
[02:41.73]You cannot over... Oh, you want to high-five me?
[02:43.82]How do I do it?
[02:45.18]Alright.
[02:46.40]Let's do that again.
[02:47.08]High-five.
[02:49.36]Oh, never mind.
[02:52.02]Yeah, the Quick-Fix is the third medic gun.
[02:54.18]You cannot overheal people with it.
[02:56.50]Overheal...
[02:57.76]Let me quickly describe this to you.
[02:59.90]Overheal is when you're at full health and you get more health added on that's not there normally.
[03:05.51]And this guy is dead.
[03:07.45]I'm about to die too.
[03:09.57]No, my goodness.
[03:10.83]My goodness gracious.
[03:12.01]Oh, my God.
[03:13.59]I got to crits creek somebody.
[03:15.49]This dude.
[03:17.64]There's no other option.
[03:19.12]There's just no option.
[03:20.16]I had to do it.
[03:23.42]We are getting dominated right now.
[03:25.14]We are getting crushed.
[03:31.49]I will tell you one thing, though.
[03:33.11]Doing live commentaries is actually quite difficult.
[03:37.37]Because I'm one of those people that cannot play and talk at the same time.
[03:43.49]My brain isn't fast enough.
[03:46.22]My slow brain can't handle talking and playing at the same time.
[03:51.52]At least for a game like this.
[03:53.77]For a high-action, fast-paced FPS, it is quite difficult to talk and play at the same time.
[04:00.42]What?
[04:00.88]No.
[04:01.72]I'm not going to let you kill me.
[04:02.70]I refuse death.
[04:03.66]I refuse death.
[04:05.48]See?
[04:05.66]I told you.
[04:06.02]I refuse death.
[04:08.54]I need to... Alright.
[04:10.49]They're going to come from behind.
[04:12.41]I'm not going to say that.
[04:13.19]I'm not going to say that.
[04:14.57]They are going to appear from behind.
[04:16.87]I'll put it that way.
[04:19.99]I need somebody to Kritzkrieg or else we're just going to lose again.
[04:23.39]Man, it's not going to be cool.
[04:26.35]Me and this mean frog man got it.
[04:28.61]Mean froggy.
[04:29.40]Uh-oh.
[04:32.76]I don't want to use it.
[04:34.52]Ubering a Pyro is not a good... Oh, here we go, here we go.
[04:36.66]Let's see if we can't make something happen here.
[04:38.40]And I'm going to pop it right now.
[04:43.18]Right now.
[04:46.69]Let's do it, Trauger.
[04:47.71]Let's do it.
[04:48.37]There's dudes behind you.
[04:49.79]There's dudes behind you, Trauger.
[04:51.19]Behind... Oh, man.
[04:56.64]Are we gonna lose?
[04:58.22]Alright.
[04:59.02]Rage heavy.
[05:00.52]Rage heavy.
[05:02.02]Forget the medic.
[05:03.57]Time for rage heavy.
[05:07.59]Did I...
[05:08.22]Alright, now I got a medic.
[05:09.76]Alright, they're not going to get this point.
[05:12.24]If they get this point, then something's really wrong with me.
[05:15.78]I'm just not a good heavy.
[05:16.86]Oh, here comes an uber.
[05:20.46]Never run away from a point.
[05:21.80]See?
[05:22.24]Because a guy like this will come over here and just cap it on you, and we'll lose.
[05:25.65]I'm going to stick around right here.
[05:29.45]Not letting this go to absolute shit.
[05:37.52]Still a scout down there.
[05:38.74]I have not forgot about that guy.
[05:43.76]We need to get the point.
[05:46.49]Oh, come on.
[05:46.95]Get Kappa.
[05:47.69]Kappa while I sit back here and defend.
[05:49.67]Come on.
[05:51.63]I'm going to go down here.
[05:53.57]Scout's ball is there.
[05:54.53]That means he's down here somewhere.
[05:59.86]Oh, nobody.
[06:00.62]Nobody.
[06:01.02]Okay.
[06:02.58]Oh, there's definitely a heavy right around this corner.
[06:05.22]Yoink!
[06:07.53]Oh, I was quicker than you.
[06:10.17]Alright, what do they got?
[06:12.96]Mini-Sentry.
[06:15.02]Soldier.
[06:15.50]Hold on, I got you.
[06:16.06]I got you.
[06:16.52]I got you.
[06:17.90]Get that sandwich.
[06:19.60]Get that sandwich, dude.
[06:20.80]Whoa!
[06:25.12]Sniper.
[06:26.06]That's what's going on.
[06:28.03]Oh, I got an uber.
[06:30.53]Oh, get me up.
[06:33.89]Get rid of that sentry.
[06:37.13]Oh, we gonna get it?
[06:37.83]Let's get it.
[06:38.61]Oh yeah, baby.
[06:40.41]Oh ho ho, my god.
[06:43.29]No, we didn't get it!
[06:46.05]We almost got it.
[06:47.31]That was a pretty good run.
[06:50.75]That was a pretty good run right there, if I don't say so myself.
[06:53.93]If I do say so myself, what am I talking about?
[06:55.87]Uh oh.
[06:58.74]Alright, I'm gonna try going for this right here, guys.
[07:02.80]Oh!
[07:03.48]Come on now, damn!
[07:04.88]Oh!
[07:06.19]If you don't know, if I kill somebody with those boxing gloves on, I get 100% crits for, like, seven seconds.
[07:13.13]And I could have just ripped through... I'm gonna try for it again.
[07:16.59]Who cares about being, like, a team player?
[07:18.49]I'm gonna, like... I'm going for it, man.
[07:21.10]And if I get it, then it's all she wrote, and I'll just crit everybody to hell.
[07:27.62]No, don't kill me!
[07:28.34]That was close.
[07:32.40]Who took the health?
[07:35.29]I need that health.
[07:38.93]There's a sniper right there and an engineer.
[07:41.59]Where's the health?
[07:43.49]What?
[07:45.89]Oh.
[07:48.44]Alright, no more messing around.
[07:50.38]No more messing around.
[07:51.08]Let's go.
[07:54.02]Yeah, let's do this.
[07:55.18]Let's do this.
[07:58.58]What do we got over here?
[07:59.98]Pyro?
[08:00.44]I don't think so, baby.
[08:02.04]You're a spy.
[08:02.74]No, you're not.
[08:05.50]If you get me that uber, we will crush people, dude.
[08:09.60]Oh, my God!
[08:12.70]There are so many people out here.
[08:16.69]There are so many people out there, man.
[08:18.73]There we go.
[08:23.45]What happened to the, uh... Yeah, the medic.
[08:27.23]No spies.
[08:28.57]Alright.
[08:29.13]I got an ubercharge.
[08:30.65]Let's get out here and kill 15 people.
[08:34.09]Let's do it!
[08:36.21]Where are you?
[08:38.77]Dude, hit it!
[08:39.35]What are you doing?
[08:41.09]What are you doing, dude?
[08:43.89]No.
[08:45.31]No.
[08:47.25]Oh my god.
[08:48.63]Oh, change this.
[08:53.34]What?
[08:54.14]Why did that happen?
[08:57.62]Ronald McDonald.
[09:00.26]Alright, if I die again, then I'm gonna end the commentary, because this is just... I don't want you guys to see us lose a million times in a row.
[09:08.35]Alright, there we go.
[09:08.91]I'm going the other way.
[09:10.07]Screw that.
[09:11.83]I'm not going in, like, the front.
[09:14.63]No!
[09:17.24]I didn't even mean to do that, either.
[09:19.88]I meant to right-click, not left-click.
[09:21.80]This is not going so well.
[09:24.46]Alright, one more death, and this is it for me.
[09:26.80]Because they're about to win.
[09:27.98]Actually, they probably will just win.
[09:31.16]I thought that was a spy.
[09:33.02]If I can just get over here.
[09:34.16]I can't, but we could have had that if that medic just ubered me.
[09:38.50]Alright, let's keep rolling on here.
[09:40.90]Let's keep rolling.
[09:41.82]That sniper is going to shoot me in the face again.
[09:43.52]I can already tell you that's going to happen.
[09:46.76]We lost!
[09:51.30]Oh, there are two snipers trying to shoot me.
[09:56.58]Oh.
[09:57.84]Well, it was a good run.
[10:00.66]And I think that's definitely going to be it.
[10:03.76]Yeah, this is it.
[10:06.55]This is definitely it.
[10:07.37]Someone's going to come from behind and cap it.
[10:10.56]Alright, this is it.
[10:12.50]Last life.
[10:12.96]Last life.
[10:13.62]I'm not going to do another one.
[10:15.00]This is it.
[10:15.90]This is the domination life right here because I've got a medic with me.
[10:21.18]And once he gets that uber, let's do it.
[10:24.50]Let's do it.
[10:26.49]Hit it.
[10:28.35]There we go.
[10:29.15]That's what I'm talking about.
[10:31.25]Get rid of this pyro blowing me around.
[10:34.70]Oh, get rid of you.
[10:36.33]Oh, look at this chaos right here.
[10:39.43]Oh, yeah, baby.
[10:42.03]He just goomba stomped me.
[10:45.25]Well, that's going to be it because this could go on forever.
[10:50.26]So this literally could go on forever.
[10:53.14]Thanks, everybody, for watching this live commentary.
[10:55.68]Happy Thanksgiving to everybody.
[10:58.10]Hope you had a good holiday.
[10:59.12]And if you didn't have it Thanksgiving, then happy Friday.
[11:05.88]So I will talk to you guys all later.
[11:08.24]Have fun, and I'll see you all next time.
[11:10.42]Take care, everybody.
[11:12.60]Let's end up with a headshot in the face.
[11:13.95]How about that, right?
[11:15.29]Take care, guys.
