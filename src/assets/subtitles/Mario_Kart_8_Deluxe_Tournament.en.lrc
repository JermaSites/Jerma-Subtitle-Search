[00:30.10]Hey, what up everybody?
[00:31.72]We're doing the Mario Kart tournament.
[00:33.59]I may have started late.
[00:35.91]We were waiting for some people.
[00:38.67]What's going on?
[00:39.49]How are you?
[00:42.03]I'm hearing a hundred voices in my ear.
[00:45.89]Let's deafen it for a second.
[00:46.79]Hello, how are you?
[00:49.22]I am currently participating in the Ludwig Mario Kart Invitational.
[00:57.62]It's going to be set up in two different ways.
[00:59.50]We're going to do the first thing.
[01:00.30]Hey, listen to me.
[01:00.96]The first thing we're going to do.
[01:01.86]I can't even see chat.
[01:02.82]Fuck.
[01:03.00]Hold on.
[01:03.34]Here we go.
[01:09.57]There we go.
[01:10.13]Now I can see.
[01:13.47]What happened to Bitcoin?
[01:15.03]I don't know.
[01:15.45]I haven't looked at it in like a day or two days.
[01:17.63]What happened?
[01:18.05]I don't know.
[01:18.53]Whatever.
[01:18.91]I'm playing Mario Kart.
[01:20.07]Whatever.
[01:21.97]If you guys don't know the rules, there's like 50 people streaming this right now.
[01:27.10]You're staying here.
[01:29.36]We're going to do the draft.
[01:30.73]It's going to be teams 6v6, I believe.
[01:33.31]Then we're going to do a free-for-all.
[01:34.93]I'm just going to jump in.
[01:35.73]We'll see.
[01:36.61]See what happens.
[01:44.16]Good luck.
[01:46.02]Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
[01:48.16]Go for it.
[01:51.33]Both competitors terribly de-synced.
[01:53.62]Cutie goes with rock.
[01:54.66]Alinity goes with paper.
[01:56.22]That is one point.
[01:57.00]Alinity, obviously, best of three.
[01:58.80]Classic rock, paper, scissors, shoot rules.
[02:00.76]Okay.
[02:01.70]Let's go for one more.
[02:03.40]Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
[02:10.32]Paper, paper.
[02:11.14]Okay, let's go again.
[02:12.68]Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
[02:19.30]All right, we got scissors versus paper.
[02:21.05]It is 1-1.
[02:21.77]It's game point now.
[02:23.21]Next RPS win wins it all.
[02:25.77]Yo.
[02:26.15]Right?
[02:26.89]Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
[02:33.23]Yo.
[02:34.17]Ty.
[02:34.43]Who are we waiting on?
[02:35.57]Yo.
[02:36.81]Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
[02:43.95]Ty, last one.
[02:45.10]Let's go.
[02:46.24]Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
[02:52.80]Cutie, you win.
[02:53.86]Yay!
[02:55.94]Gotta win every time.
[02:58.58]What a match.
[03:00.26]That's probably better than the Mario Kart match we're gonna see.
[03:03.66]Mm-hm.
[03:04.56]So now what?
[03:04.96]If you do win, Cutie, which means you get the first pick, who would you like to pick on your team?
[03:09.06]First pick, okay.
[03:11.80]Cutie, cutie, cutie, come on, cutie, come on, cutie.
[03:14.80]Absolutely not, Ms.
[03:16.43]Kiff.
[03:17.19]I'm going to go ahead and say Clint, come over to Team Butt Stuff.
[03:22.05]Come on, Clint.
[03:23.60]Clint, you are on Team Butt Stuff.
[03:26.76]Is Clint the only person here with more than five hours in this game?
[03:30.12]But, Seth, you need a good choice.
[03:33.14]I'm literally a guy.
[03:34.60]I'm literally a guy.
[03:35.92]Always win.
[03:37.46]Have you ever played this online, Miz?
[03:39.05]Didn't you just have your mom, like, set up an account for you just to play online?
[03:43.43]Dude, I just turned 13, Seth.
[03:44.91]Wait, everyone's saying same shirt, Andy.
[03:46.55]What are you talking about?
[03:47.53]This is mint.
[03:48.81]Was I wearing this mint shirt?
[03:50.15]No, I wasn't.
[03:50.51]I was wearing blue.
[03:52.23]Look, we got the draft going.
[03:53.81]I'm going to end up being, like, the last kid picked at the basketball game.
[03:57.50]I already know it.
[04:00.52]I think Connor is cute, and I think he looks like he's good, so I'm going to go with Connor.
[04:05.14]Hell yeah.
[04:05.82]Let's go, Connor.
[04:07.06]What the heck?
[04:10.10]Watch those eyes.
[04:11.72]Team Alinity, it is.
[04:12.68]Do you want me to tell you who to pick?
[04:16.20]No, Clint.
[04:16.94]I want Mango.
[04:18.38]You're so dumb.
[04:19.02]You're so dumb.
[04:20.32]That was a little nasty.
[04:22.12]I'm going to be the last person picked.
[04:23.42]I already know.
[04:24.28]It is Mango on that team.
[04:26.24]Alinity, you get to pick again.
[04:27.96]Oh, by the way, if you want to see the scores, go here.
[04:31.95]I think I'm going to give my child just in case I need to help him with something else again.
[04:35.69]No, no, please.
[04:36.87]No, me, Clint.
[04:46.89]QT, you get another pick.
[04:48.21]Who would you like?
[04:50.43]Charlie.
[04:51.15]It could be anyone, QT.
[04:51.83]Let's go.
[04:52.33]Let's fucking go.
[04:53.65]We just got the game today, Stance.
[04:55.39]I'm going to go with Charlie.
[04:56.84]Yes.
[05:01.34]Um, let's go with Jerma.
[05:05.11]Bingo!
[05:05.57]There it is!
[05:06.03]Welcome to the attraction of Jerma.
[05:08.15]It came back around, QT.
[05:09.07]You know what you want to do.
[05:10.45]To not get picked last with five hours in, that's a skill alone.
[05:13.27]Prezzo, come on.
[05:14.42]You got to take Prezzo on this dream team.
[05:16.20]That's what I was afraid of.
[05:17.88]Oh no!
[05:19.04]Prezzo!
[05:20.28]Wait, we got Jerma.
[05:21.10]We're pretty good right now.
[05:21.96]Your options are, to be clear, whether it's Wubbby, Prezzo, Stanz, or Simply.
[05:27.33]Yo.
[05:28.21]I'm pretty cracked.
[05:29.59]Wubbby!
[05:31.17]Terrible call.
[05:33.10]What?
[05:35.76]If I had to guess who's good, I would probably, I really just don't want to listen to Simply's mic.
[05:42.95]So, I don't know.
[05:43.81]It's up to you.
[05:46.47]Okay, who is left?
[05:47.55]Who is left?
[05:48.53]He's definitely said much more useless things.
[05:53.30]We have Wubby, Prezzo, Simply, and... I think that's it.
[06:02.63]Simply, Prezzo, and Stance.
[06:05.25]What character am I?
[06:06.29]I'm the one going like this.
[06:10.74]I seem simply plain, he's absolutely garbage.
[06:13.54]Prezzo's honestly- Come on, dude!
[06:15.04]I beat you half the time we played!
[06:17.02]Alright, is that PayMoney while we're talking?
[06:19.36]You literally sound the same as him.
[06:20.84]You sound very similar.
[06:22.31]Your mic is fucking- I can use my better mic if you want.
[06:26.11]Wait, why would you choose to use your worst mic?
[06:28.17]Man, what was that decision?
[06:29.55]Does this sound any better?
[06:31.57]Thank you.
[06:32.53]That was night and day, actually.
[06:34.82]On that mic, I think we choose Prezzo.
[06:39.06]I was going to take Prezzo.
[06:45.59]I definitely don't want Stance.
[06:47.85]What is going on?
[06:48.73]I'm nasty.
[06:49.43]I'm so good.
[06:50.47]You've got the game today.
[06:51.82]I choose Simply.
[06:56.36]all right you're dead to me which means you get stands to recap the teams are team stuff cutie clint mango charlie wubby simply team alinity is alinity connor mizkif jerma prezzo stands winning team gets 69 gifted it's 12 races that's a good team tracking the points that's a good team it's gonna run like a free-for-all so you're gonna have to learn your teammates faces and their carts because you will be able to hit them friendly fire is
[07:19.68]Oh, shit.
[07:20.32]What?
[07:20.48]Friendly fire is on?
[07:21.94]Friendly fire is on, so make sure you know what your teammate looks like and don't shoot a red shell at them.
[07:25.86]Oh, fuck.
[07:26.36]You guys do have your own voice channels you can hop to.
[07:28.40]Team QD and Team Alinity.
[07:30.26]You guys need to talk strategy and say, hey, don't hit me with a fucking red shell, Ms.
[07:33.03]Gif.
[07:33.45]By the way, guys, if you get a blue shell and you're on my team, do not throw it, okay?
[07:37.19]Don't hurt me.
[07:37.95]It doesn't hit your teammates.
[07:38.81]You're not going to be in first.
[07:39.75]It doesn't matter.
[07:40.19]I'm terrified.
[07:40.87]I feel like I'm going to hurt everybody.
[07:44.23]Good luck to all.
[07:46.84]I need like a two minute.
[07:49.52]Like a two minute.
[07:50.48]I'll be right back.
[07:51.02]Hop into your calls and just talk shop.
[07:54.30]Are you not playing?
[07:58.54]No, I'm casting.
[08:00.48]You got the easy job.
[08:02.02]If we're in the different calls though, how are you going to see the video?
[08:07.71]Are you guys saying sabotage the whole team?
[08:12.09]Do you want me to literally not get invited to anything ever again?
[08:18.00]You want me to get like stared at by like 25 people at TwitchCon all going like this?
[08:22.22]Oh yeah, it's that fucking guy.
[08:26.46]Oh, we're network Andy now!
[08:31.01]Alright, I gotta move.
[08:38.49]Hell yeah.
[08:39.61]Alright, what are we thinking in terms of making sure we don't kill each other?
[08:44.34]Wild idea, we all play Donkey Kong.
[08:47.52]Okay, I actually fuck with that so hard.
[08:49.10]Wait, everyone plays the same character.
[08:50.60]Oh shit, that's a good idea.
[08:51.36]We play the same character so we don't hit each other.
[08:52.80]Holy shit, that's brilliant.
[08:55.53]That's the last pick right here.
[08:57.33]Everybody Donkey Kong?
[08:58.87]I'm into Donkey Kong for sure.
[09:00.45]What?
[09:01.17]Donkey Kong is like a Tarn though.
[09:03.61]He takes up too much of the screen, doesn't he?
[09:06.05]Yeah, but he's fast.
[09:06.93]Big characters are fast.
[09:08.05]He's the leader of the bunch.
[09:08.91]You know him well.
[09:09.97]Yeah, he's finally back to kick some tail, you know?
[09:12.25]Okay.
[09:12.47]Do we have everybody in the lobby?
[09:13.61]Do we know?
[09:14.88]Definitely not.
[09:16.16]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[09:17.22]No, I'm not in the lobby.
[09:19.06]So just don't attack Donkey Kong.
[09:20.50]I got it.
[09:20.98]So how do I join?
[09:23.44]You go to friends.
[09:24.50]Okay, okay.
[09:25.86]Yeah, I got it.
[09:26.64]This is fucking brilliant strategy, by the way.
[09:29.51]Absolutely flawless strategy.
[09:32.47]They're not going to do this shit.
[09:33.49]We're going to fucking roll them.
[09:36.49]Go to online for multiplayer.
[09:38.40]Online and then friends.
[09:39.88]Oh, okay.
[09:44.50]Oh, no.

[09:58.87]Oh, no.

[11:12.46]Oh shit.
[11:12.88]Okay Wait, how do you go offline?
[11:19.82]I don't think you need to.
[11:20.98]As long as you have no friends on your friends list, you should be okay.
[11:23.34]Or no friends slash you've never played a game, essentially.
[11:26.02]If you have friends, just try to join last.
[11:28.54]Yeah, I'm gonna wait.
[11:30.40]I want to use this thing.
[11:30.96]This thing's so ugly, though.

[11:52.25]Should we just be the same car, too?
[11:54.61]Uh, well, it depends on if you like using a certain car.
[11:57.98]The Beetle's kinda nice with it.
[12:00.68]The Beetle is one of the best cars, but we don't have it.
[12:03.40]Wait, no, you start with the Beetle.
[12:04.58]Yeah, everybody had to make a new account because of the friends thing.
[12:07.36]No, I think you start with the Beetle.
[12:09.24]You're thinking of the other one.
[12:11.79]What Beetle are you talking about?
[12:13.57]I don't see the car.
[12:14.31]It kinda looks like a hot dog.
[12:16.79]It's like a Hercules Beetle.

[13:21.77]I don't know if anybody knows who's... Fucking Nintendo, I swear to God.
[13:25.57]I don't think so.
[13:26.45]I haven't seen their name.
[13:27.41]They need to speak so I can see their name.
[13:29.62]We all had to make, like, new accounts.
[13:32.22]New Nintendo, like, online accounts for this.
[13:34.66]I feel like it might be yours, though.
[13:35.96]Oh, it might be my... I have people on my friends list, but...
[13:39.13]Alright, let's just have Stans wait to join.
[13:42.03]If your account's clean, then just join.
[13:43.53]So, like, Miz is clear.
[13:44.39]Yeah, I'm clear.
[13:45.69]It's Pedro.
[13:46.31]Your name is Pedro.
[13:47.85]Who is Pedro on their friends list?
[13:50.45]I got a clean account.
[13:51.23]If you're on my friends list, I'm about to fuck you up, brother.
[13:53.61]And then this guy.
[13:54.23]Who is this other guy he's trying to join, too?
[13:57.65]Hey, Jerma.
[13:58.67]What's up?
[13:59.11]Guys, I have an idea.
[14:00.05]Would you like to come on my show one day?
[14:02.25]I think I can set it up.
[14:04.23]Yeah.
[14:05.73]Do you guys let me set it up?
[14:08.97]Anybody who joins, their friends can join.
[14:11.98]Okay, it wasn't anyone of my friends.
[14:13.14]I actually have a clear account.
[14:14.24]I have a clear account.
[14:16.66]Jeremy, you're a crowdfavorite.
[14:17.74]Can you join a friend if they're in a tournament, though?
[14:19.62]I don't think so.
[14:20.80]They got good taste.
[14:23.13]I don't know about that.
[14:23.87]I mean, they watch me.
[14:26.39]Shit, that's right.
[14:27.49]I like your stream a lot.
[14:29.55]You got a great stream.
[14:32.73]No one ever says that, man.
[14:33.95]You do have a good stream.
[14:35.09]Don't beat yourself up about that shit.
[14:39.02]You mean that?
[14:39.84]I do.
[14:40.64]Pedro.
[14:41.90]Maybe he is one of me.
[14:43.06]I hope one of you guys isn't Pedro.
[14:44.80]I want to say Networking Andy.
[14:46.72]What are you talking about?
[14:49.06]Yeah.
[14:49.74]Yeah, rejoin.
[14:50.26]Especially if you have a fresh account.
[14:52.66]Send me advice on how to fix it if it happens again.
[14:56.17]Donkey Kong.
[14:59.47]So there's no online if I use a random account, right?
[15:02.71]You know what Jerm, I'm gonna mod you in my chat.
[15:05.13]I get mod?
[15:05.47]Are you serious?
[15:06.87]Yeah.
[15:08.05]I modded you.
[15:09.03]Oh shit.
[15:10.67]Yeah.
[15:12.17]This is like 2012.
[15:13.11]Tell them to join quick.
[15:16.29]Mod you, I mod you back.
[15:18.26]Yeah, that greasy hole person is back in.
[15:20.92]No, greasy hole's Charlie.
[15:22.30]Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[15:24.00]Who's the green shirt on the left?
[15:26.69]That's definitely something Simply would wear.
[15:28.07]We just lost Prezzo.
[15:29.57]Oh, that was Prezzo.
[15:30.41]Oh, shit.
[15:31.15]Connor, do you have it set to 12 races?
[15:33.17]Yeah.
[15:33.43]Well, I set it up after this screen.

[17:51.52]What the fuck is Mario Kart Stadium?
[17:53.18]What is that?
[17:54.54]It's the first map.
[17:55.22]Should we all pick the same character maybe?
[17:56.80]We're doing the first level?
[17:58.59]I'm telling you, I farm that place.
[18:01.85]Favorite level.
[18:04.27]Sorry, what are we choosing?
[18:06.19]I chose the first place.
[18:06.95]It doesn't matter.
[18:07.41]I picked the first one.
[18:09.18]All right, just don't hit Donkey Kong, right?
[18:13.16]Yeah, don't hit Donkey Kong.
[18:13.92]You guys are all Donkey Kong?

[18:17.72]I'm Go Peach.
[18:18.26]Oh, sorry.
[18:18.64]We were supposed to not go Donkey Kong?
[18:22.15]We were supposed to go Donkey Kong.
[18:24.21]We were supposed to all go Donkey Kong.
[18:26.97]I know.
[18:27.31]I was going to and then I ran out of time.
[18:29.69]It's on you.
[18:30.49]First place.
[18:30.91]I'm actually going to start being serious for you guys.
[18:33.65]Alright, let's go.
[18:34.21]Don't hit Donkey Kong.
[18:35.13]What if they have a Donkey Kong?
[18:39.50]Oh, then we're fucked.
[18:40.36]By the way, Trevor, there is a mod meeting tonight.

[18:50.90]Oh, shit!
[19:05.72]Oh wait, you're Donkey Kong.
[19:06.88]Oh, I got red shell.
[19:07.51]Did you red shell me, Connor?
[19:08.53]I'm lucky, I'm lucky, I'm lucky.
[19:10.87]You son of a bitch.
[19:12.47]Oh, fuck!
[19:14.35]How do we get the other people's names off the screen?

[19:27.74]Alright, you're peach, you're peach.
[19:29.16]I'm right behind you.
[19:30.42]I got a red shell.
[19:32.39]Don't worry, I'm holding up the rear, team.
[19:34.97]I'm at a cutie.
[19:36.15]This car sucks.
[19:43.85]Oh shit, the left side has a speed boost.
[19:51.43]I'm just gonna throw this out.
[19:57.44]Fucking ninth place.
[20:05.24]Come here.
[20:07.31]Connor, don't drop that behind you.
[20:08.91]Okay.
[20:09.19]I tried to get in on clean.
[20:12.17]Hey, who's in first place?
[20:13.02]Who's in first place?
[20:13.76]I got a blue shell.
[20:14.30]Who's in first place?
[20:14.98]I don't think any of us.
[20:16.12]It's going to be clean.
[20:16.76]Going for it.
[20:17.18]Ready?
[20:17.42]No way.
[20:20.08]Blue shell out.
[20:20.70]Never fucking let- Wait, Connie, you just shot it with me.
[20:23.28]I didn't say you were cute.
[20:25.90]They weren't Donkey Kong, I had no idea.
[20:27.00]I'm at fucking 12th!
[20:27.74]Alright, I got a bullet bill, get out of my way!
[20:29.68]Okay, okay, I'll stay out of the middle.
[20:32.30]It did not work, I got hit.
[20:34.80]Wait, I tried to avoid you!
[20:36.63]Alright, Donkey Kong boys.
[20:38.01]I got a bullet bill too.
[20:39.27]I fucked up, I fucked up.
[20:40.55]I got scared about the blue shell.
[20:41.71]I fucked up.
[20:42.25]Oh, oh.
[20:43.59]I'm sorry.
[20:44.33]Oh, I got one of them.
[20:45.75]I just spam-died him.
[20:46.95]Yes!
[20:55.67]I don't play as Donkey Kong, man.
[20:57.11]Donkey Kong sucks.
[20:57.99]Nice job, Connor.
[20:58.79]Wait, Preso!
[20:59.60]Preso!
[21:00.44]Nice!
[21:01.40]Oh my god!
[21:02.98]My boy, Preso!
[21:04.22]My boy!
[21:04.82]Okay, good.
[21:05.70]We did good.
[21:06.28]We did good.
[21:07.10]No, we won that for sure.
[21:08.32]We won that.
[21:09.10]Nice job.
[21:10.34]Okay, go Donkey Kong.
[21:12.44]Yeah, please go Dong.
[21:14.66]That was confusing.
[21:15.48]Okay, okay, okay.
[21:16.50]Who was Black Yosh?
[21:17.50]Who dare enter Black Yosh?
[21:19.84]Wait, I'm on your team, right?
[21:21.88]Just general rule, do not pick the same map.
[21:25.14]Fair.
[21:25.76]So that way we just don't spam it.
[21:26.88]Because I was literally going to pick the same map.
[21:29.48]I just picked Donkey Kong, by the way.
[21:33.27]I haven't dropped any frames.
[21:35.65]I have zero dropped frames.
[21:38.31]Wait, what's going on?
[21:39.35]You mean like on here?
[21:40.59]Oh, shit.
[21:41.09]Where are we picking?
[21:44.41]Where are we picking?
[21:45.01]What are we doing?
[21:47.15]Yeah, I think it should work.
[21:47.89]Oh, shit.
[21:54.86]We kind of all picked randomly, but that's okay.
[21:57.60]I'm really proud of you guys.
[21:59.20]That was a good race.
[22:00.60]No, that was good.
[22:01.52]Yeah, that was good.
[22:03.52]Yeah, I don't have any drop frames on OBS.
[22:06.38]I don't know where it's coming from.
[22:08.58]Okay.
[22:09.94]I got six, so I fucked up.
[22:13.40]I got 11.
[22:13.68]Okay.
[22:14.48]I got 10.
[22:15.40]Look at this.
[22:16.34]In the lead, we have four out of... That's so good.
[22:19.98]Four dongs out of six plays.
[22:21.30]That's really good.
[22:22.17]And what do we get if we win this again?
[22:24.37]69 subs.
[22:25.77]Oh, wow.
[22:26.31]Is your game plan all Donkey Kong here so you don't forget?
[22:28.95]Almost all Donkey Kong.
[22:30.38]Okay.
[22:31.24]Who did go Donkey Kong?
[22:33.80]One of them didn't at first, but we just owned her.
[22:35.66]I am.
[22:35.94]I am Donkey Kong now.
[22:36.90]Okay.
[22:37.16]All right.
[22:37.48]Oh, okay.
[22:38.04]There you go.
[22:41.38]Fuck.
[22:44.07]Oh, fuck.
[22:50.50]Okay, that was bad.
[22:51.80]Charlie's my nemesis.
[22:52.90]Gotta just pass him.
[22:54.56]That's the trick.
[22:56.44]Not last.
[22:57.44]Okay, I'm missing everything.
[23:03.46]I did all my practicing on dry bones, not on Donkey Kong.
[23:06.60]Okay.
[23:07.02]Hey, we can switch.
[23:08.96]I'm such an idiot.
[23:18.95]Oh, shit!
[23:19.75]Oh, sorry.
[23:20.13]He knocked you into me.
[23:22.31]Oh, fuck.
[23:29.21]Oh, who's in first?
[23:29.69]I have Blue Shell.
[23:31.71]Clint is.
[23:32.69]I'm gonna go next.
[23:33.23]I'm gonna rip it.
[23:35.87]Ripped it.
[23:38.91]I'm lost.
[23:39.41]That's Ab.
[23:44.03]I have a star and I'm not even going faster than the people driving normal speed.
[23:51.86]Just the worst things are happening to me.
[23:55.06]I need a miracle.
[23:55.80]Orangey Jesus.
[23:58.58]What just hit me?
[23:59.60]I couldn't even hear that shell.
[24:03.67]First to last baby.
[24:11.37]Actually, first to last?
[24:12.44]Hey, who's in first place?
[24:15.16]I made it back to the pack.
[24:21.12]What the fuck happened?
[24:28.77]I got Bullet Bill, careful.
[24:29.61]Stay in the middle, stay in the middle.
[24:35.47]Sorry, Prezzo.
[24:36.49]He went to the middle, my friend.
[24:38.58]No, no, no, I didn't get hit, I didn't get hit.
[24:40.46]Oh, good, good, good.
[24:43.40]Oh, come on, just hit somebody.
[24:46.34]Oh, shit.
[24:47.96]That's big, miss.
[24:48.74]That's big.
[24:49.24]No, you just hit me, Presum.
[24:52.02]Seventh.
[24:52.32]Okay, what did we get?
[24:53.04]What did we get?
[24:53.56]Oh, I don't know.
[24:54.80]I didn't think this was bad.
[24:56.02]Oh, they got one, two, and three.
[24:57.48]Oh, one, two, three.
[24:58.60]Wait, who's one, one, one, one?
[24:59.81]Dude, I played this game for like two hours of my whole life, and I've never played it floating around going two miles per hour.
[25:09.02]That map screws me up.
[25:10.46]I couldn't hear the items.
[25:12.71]Alright, can I please- If we got- If we got one- Yeah, yeah, change characters.
[25:15.49]Yeah, yeah.
[25:17.11]Change it.
[25:17.49]It'll be Dry Bones.
[25:18.89]Dude, it is so important for us to get first.
[25:21.31]It's so important.
[25:21.77]I'm down to be- First place, literally- The five or something like that.
[25:25.58]It's- It's- Like, we need first.
[25:30.86]We got this, though.
[25:31.92]We got this.
[25:35.30]I mean, they're mostly Warios and Black Yoshi.
[25:37.46]I feel like we can remember who they are if you want to change characters, you know?
[25:41.21]We're good.
[25:42.19]Alright, if it picks my map, we win.
[25:49.53]Buffering is insane.
[25:50.85]I'm not seeing any of that.
[25:53.28]I wonder why.
[25:53.84]This is a skill-based map.
[26:09.75]I'm just gonna take it slow.
[26:12.09]I hate this map.
[26:12.77]I always lose though.
[26:13.91]Always.
[26:14.45]I'm warning you.
[26:14.89]I do really bad in this map.
[26:15.93]We're winning by the way.
[26:16.69]We're winning.
[26:17.17]We're winning?
[26:18.03]48 points.
[26:18.39]Yep.
[26:19.90]Well, after the first race we're winning, but I don't know about second.
[26:22.58]No, we're winning.
[26:23.22]We are.
[26:23.44]Alright.
[26:25.06]Love that.
[26:25.36]Here we go.
[26:28.69]Here we go.
[26:29.05]Much better.
[26:31.99]Yeah, you just needed the dry bones.
[26:44.52]Oh, this place sucks.
[26:46.16]Yeah, this one's not my favorite.
[26:52.40]No!
[26:52.80]I'm sorry!
[26:54.72]Dude, Charlie hit me.
[26:55.62]Are you guys killing each other?
[26:59.00]Yup.
[26:59.32]Oh, did one of you hit me?
[27:00.77]Miss?
[27:01.91]Someone hit me and there's only Donkey Kongs behind me.
[27:09.69]I feel like it might have been one of you.
[27:15.67]Oh!
[27:18.47]Wow!
[27:19.15]Why was that?
[27:21.61]What was the luck on that?
[27:22.86]Did you fucking squirt me and just like crawl on your wall?
[27:26.48]No, this- oh my god, this- they stole a blue sh- uh, a boo.
[27:30.48]Oh my god, that was ridiculous RNG.
[27:34.30]I hate sniffling, man.
[27:38.11]Oh, who's in first?
[27:39.15]Hey, who's in first?
[27:41.03]Sorry.
[27:41.57]I'm ripping it.
[27:42.35]Fuck it.
[27:43.99]Oh god.
[27:47.14]Oh, alright, I got a lightning bolt.
[27:48.32]Are you guys ready?
[27:49.94]I mean, we can't dodge it, right?
[27:53.80]I'm behind you.
[27:54.54]Oh, I should have done that.
[28:00.40]I got a bullet bill coming in.
[28:03.56]Oh, fucking played bad.
[28:07.66]This is not going to be anywhere.
[28:08.74]Fuck that.
[28:16.69]I'm gonna hit you guys!
[28:18.43]Oh, fuck.
[28:18.99]That was me.
[28:20.19]Sorry.
[28:20.35]I got two Yoshis behind you, though.
[28:22.89]Yeah, you did.
[28:24.55]Sorry.
[28:25.85]Nope.
[28:26.39]Oh, dodge corner.
[28:27.11]Nice job.
[28:27.83]Oh, shit.
[28:28.23]Give me it.
[28:28.59]Give me it.
[28:29.99]Nope.
[28:31.70]Oh, I'm about to get my shell.
[28:37.72]Dude, I have the worst luck I've ever seen.
[28:39.62]They literally... A ghost stole my shell, and the second he stole my shell, I lost... I just got decimated.
[28:48.14]I just struck by lightning, sorry.
[28:51.79]We hit each other a lot.
[28:56.75]I'm done with Donkey Kong, honestly.
[28:58.03]My stream is fucked.
[28:59.07]I'm not dropping any frames.
[29:20.77]lagging, hold on, what if I go like this?
[29:23.91]fix it?
[29:28.23]I was head out and then I got hit and then I just went- how are you this bad?
[29:33.69]uh, I've played Mario Kart 8 one time ever for like an hour or two is this- is it a slideshow?
[29:41.68]I'm- I don't understand this doesn't make any sense
[29:47.86]Anybody else buffering right now?
[29:49.53]Everyone's saying the stream's buffering.
[29:52.35]I got no drop frames, though.
[29:55.31]Uh, no.
[29:55.73]Mine's feeling good.
[29:57.21]Dude, wait, wait, wait.
[29:58.71]Stop, stop, stop.
[29:59.25]Guys, we are still in the lead.
[30:00.33]It is 84 to 80.
[30:00.79]Alright, alright.
[30:02.35]We got this.
[30:03.19]We need a big first race.
[30:05.19]Okay, this map, you need to make sure that you're ahead, otherwise you're gonna get fucked.
[30:09.53]Because it is a very difficult map to have abilities on.
[30:12.93]Yep.
[30:15.06]Oh, shit.
[30:15.78]Really?
[30:16.06]We're in Rainbow Road?
[30:20.06]So try to make sure you're not in last because if you get abilities, you're going to fall so far behind.
[30:24.59]I actually feel like I'm going to pull through on this one.
[30:38.23]That's what they think about you.
[30:39.78]A rainbow road Andy.
[30:40.60]That's what they called me.
[30:42.42]Oh, I'm actually fucking...
[30:49.32]Racing like... I got something to race for, dude.
[30:52.57]Oh, let's go.
[30:58.71]I feel like that DBZ character that thinks he's really fucking strong and then realizes that everybody is a thousand times stronger no matter how much you try.
[31:05.94]Like, I just Kamehameha'd one of you guys in the chest and you were just like, oh, let's get bit by a fucking mosquito.
[31:25.52]Prezzo, I'm with you.
[31:26.08]I'm hoping for a blue shell.
[31:29.23]Oh god, I have the worst luck.
[31:31.63]Oh, great.
[31:36.15]Prezzo, if you want to throw it, go for it.
[31:37.59]I'm all behind you.
[31:38.19]No, I'm scared of blue shells.
[31:42.93]Oh wait, third lap.
[31:52.44]I'm with this fucking thing, I swear to god.
[31:58.14]I thought the B button was like the slow down button.
[32:06.48]Is that not the case?
[32:07.26]It is.
[32:09.51]Nice.
[32:12.59]I should try to destroy Clint more.
[32:20.21]Yeah, it's fine.
[32:22.09]No, that's good.
[32:22.77]You and I... That was good.
[32:24.07]We were so far back.
[32:26.77]I got fucked by items.
[32:29.69]That was good.
[32:30.47]Stuff that wasn't even meant for me was hitting me.
[32:32.07]Ahead, it's just impossible to fall behind.
[32:35.69]It really is.
[32:38.85]That's why I was just telling you to chuck reds.
[32:40.91]I don't know if that was good.
[32:41.73]I have no idea what's going on.
[32:44.71]My OBS says zero drop frames.
[32:46.23]My game looks perfect.
[32:46.99]It looks through OBS too.
[32:48.13]I don't understand.
[32:50.68]I have no idea what's going on.
[32:52.04]Stop streaming to Discord.
[32:55.87]I'm not.
[32:56.41]I turned that off.
[33:02.43]I have no idea what's going on.
[33:13.78]So what is happening?
[33:14.56]What is it doing?
[33:15.65]Hold on.
[33:16.03]What if I do this?
[33:22.66]Does it restart the stream?
[33:34.76]I have absolutely no idea why this is happening.
[33:44.16]Oh, there's two black Yoshis now?
[33:46.08]Was there always two?
[33:46.70]The...
[33:51.29]The legend of the Black Yosh goes far back.
[34:08.00]Just drove right into that banana.
[34:09.34]Oh, is there a shortcut?
[34:12.32]These guys are... Come home.
[34:20.42]Alright, I'm in first right now.
[34:22.52]Sorry.
[34:23.66]That was on me.
[34:25.46]I was aiming for someone else.
[34:27.69]It's okay.
[34:28.75]We're all really close.
[34:30.63]We're doing good this race so far.
[34:38.87]Fuck you, bitch!
[34:40.86]I took Simply out.
[34:43.12]I literally watched out.
[34:43.74]I'm right next to you.
[34:45.51]Don't use that.
[34:45.95]Don't use that.
[34:46.35]Don't use that.
[34:47.75]Who's in first place?
[34:48.45]Who's in first right now?
[34:49.39]I'm in first.
[34:49.81]Hold it.
[34:50.03]Hold it.
[34:50.31]I'm not going to throw it.
[34:52.68]I'm in second.
[34:53.92]Oh, you're in second?
[34:54.50]Oh, I threw a fucking red shot at you.
[34:56.10]You're in first, second, and third right now.
[34:58.46]You tell me.
[34:58.98]Hold this.
[34:59.60]Hold this, boys.
[35:00.40]If you hold it, Jerma, I think no other blues will spawn.
[35:03.01]All right.
[35:03.77]Good.
[35:04.25]I'll be useful for one goddamn round.
[35:06.73]That's pro strat.
[35:13.29]I think I could've changed my, like, tires or something.
[35:15.05]I'm going, like, fucking two miles per hour.
[35:17.05]Mango's right behind me.
[35:17.81]Mango's right behind me.
[35:20.53]Mango's now ahead of me.
[35:23.07]Oh, my God.
[35:23.45]I'm gonna get my fucking everything in the back.
[35:25.17]So slow.
[35:28.72]Watch out.
[35:29.04]He's got three red shells.
[35:30.24]Yup.
[35:30.86]That's luck.
[35:34.82]Watch out.
[35:35.08]Will it be coming?
[35:35.70]Far ahead.
[35:39.54]Dude, Connor's way ahead.
[35:41.46]Sick.
[35:42.46]Shit Connor?
[35:49.97]Dude I feel like I'm riding on a fucking tricycle.
[35:53.77]Why am I so slow?
[36:19.34]oh that was huge eating right there that was the team too that's the best german you are a god there you chuck thank you thank you I'm gonna change cars right it did it knocked them out first let me just get blue shells hold them yeah I sniped three of them at the end like two before the last turn and somebody right at the end as well like I took three of them
[36:47.84]on Discord so I can see your perspective?
[36:51.70]Um... No, that would be very difficult.
[36:55.58]Yeah, I'm live.
[36:57.05]Let me see if I can figure it out.
[36:58.61]I don't know what's going on, but I think from trying to stream my perspective, I think I'm buffering my stream, but I'm not dropping any frames.
[37:06.73]It's weird.
[37:07.69]Sometimes it does that, and if it does that, just back out.
[37:10.03]It's fine.
[37:10.48]I'm just trying to get as many as possible.
[37:12.92]Mrs., your stream's fogged, so you can turn it off.
[37:15.28]Oh shit, really?
[37:16.04]I don't know why.
[37:17.66]Wait, is everybody's stream fucked right now?
[37:24.33]Look at these dongs, baby.
[37:26.65]Damn, look at that top four.
[37:27.91]Oh my god.
[37:30.56]By the way, get behind other dongs and use them so you can get some speed.
[37:35.74]Genius.
[37:38.77]Clint has a red zone front.
[37:50.51]I'm behind you, Connor.
[37:52.07]I took his red, I took his red.
[37:54.43]I'm gonna try and take Simply here.
[38:06.83]Can you move a little bit to your left, Russell?
[38:08.88]Yep.
[38:10.72]You're mine too late now.
[38:13.06]I'm at 11.
[38:22.91]Give me the purple.
[38:23.31]Give me the purple.
[38:26.33]We need to catch up.
[38:26.99]We're literally in drama.
[38:35.20]Wait, Clint's an 8th.
[38:36.06]Okay.
[38:36.90]No, I'm an 8th.
[38:38.76]Oh, he's... Yeah, he's an 7th.
[38:39.46]I'm about to pass him.
[38:44.15]Hey, Mango's in first.
[38:45.15]If Maya's a blue.
[38:46.81]No, I'm not.
[38:49.25]Boss, I'm so sorry.
[38:50.57]Shit!
[38:50.91]Yes!
[38:51.33]Oh, you're fine.
[38:53.51]Will you get lightning?
[38:54.35]Uh, coordinate so people that have stars can use it.
[38:56.17]I-I'm-come on, I'm in front of you!
[38:57.63]Nice.
[38:58.01]We're, uh, two, three, four.
[39:02.46]We should-we should be able to get Mango out of here.
[39:08.22]Oh, jeez.
[39:08.84]Okay, uh, okay.
[39:11.90]Fuck.
[39:16.90]Watch out, Nate, I'm sorry!
[39:18.26]No, you're fine, you're fine, I dodged it.
[39:20.35]No, I dodged it, we're good.
[39:21.69]We're good, I'm in first.
[39:22.71]Rezzo, hold that banana.
[39:23.43]Let's go.
[39:23.93]I have blue, I have blue.
[39:26.97]Hold it.
[39:27.73]Tell me when it's clear.
[39:28.35]I've got a red.
[39:30.59]Or when you finish, so I can just knock someone out in front of me.
[39:35.49]Let's go, oh my god!
[39:36.31]I went for that mushroom, I clutched it!
[39:38.46]Woo!
[39:39.08]Use it, use it, use it.
[39:41.70]Oh shit!
[39:44.08]Let's go, baby.
[39:45.08]What a clutch.
[39:46.36]What a clutch.
[39:47.02]I knew that mushroom was there.
[39:48.04]I went for it.
[39:53.34]We're getting up there.
[39:55.67]Oh, God.
[39:56.57]I'm going to drop a call and come right back.
[39:57.99]I'm going to redraw the call because I have no idea why this is happening.
[40:11.58]He's just...
[40:13.58]Nice stream.
[40:14.20]I don't get it.
[40:14.98]This is very distracting.
[40:23.19]Not 12th.
[40:23.65]Oh no, thank god.
[40:25.11]I wish I knew what the fuck was happening.
[40:29.41]Fuck, I gotta go.
[40:33.45]We got first and second.
[40:41.96]How am I doing?
[40:42.48]Am I top two?
[40:46.32]Wait, Jerma.
[40:46.76]What place did you get?
[40:47.94]I was in ninth, man.
[40:49.28]I was- I was- I didn't- Oh, nine!
[40:52.26]That's- No, that's good.
[40:53.08]That's good.
[40:54.31]That's still good.
[40:54.85]This track kind of sucks.
[40:56.23]It's kind of a bit of a free-for-all.
[41:02.31]Who has the highest points?
[41:04.09]Quick update.
[41:06.67]We're up by 20?
[41:08.67]Yeah.
[41:09.13]We've been killing these last two races.
[41:10.29]You're literally underwater.
[41:12.69]Wait, my mic is?
[41:13.80]No, you're good now.
[41:15.18]Oh, okay.
[41:17.04]What'd you say the score was?
[41:19.76]One of the Wario's just choked.
[41:41.44]I caught him back here, don't throw the banana.
[41:43.90]Don't on the mud, fuck!
[41:50.06]Oh, what the fuck just hit me?
[41:56.07]Yeah, that mud fucked me up.
[41:57.65]I don't want to go in front of... I'm in first, by the way.
[42:10.31]I'm in last, by the way.
[42:12.31]It's all right.
[42:12.93]Holy shit.
[42:15.03]This track isn't honest.
[42:16.29]Anything that shouldn't count.
[42:18.54]So true.
[42:19.58]So brave of you to say that, too.
[42:20.64]Yeah.
[42:25.18]Oh, Jesus.
[42:27.24]Mega Euclid top two.
[42:28.42]The dream team.
[42:29.78]Oh, no.
[42:36.26]Oh, that thing just fucks you.
[42:37.34]Oh, my God.
[42:37.68]I'm so sorry.
[42:38.38]I think it actually helped you.
[42:39.78]I'll bet you hit me.
[42:52.70]Oh, I have the thing where I have everything.
[42:54.30]I'm not trying to throw it at you if I do.
[42:57.01]Hey, who's in first?
[43:03.23]Oh, my God.
[43:03.73]I should have just thrown the boomerang.
[43:04.87]Wait, do we get first place?
[43:07.03]We're not done yet.
[43:07.75]Not over yet.
[43:08.21]Throw it, throw it, if you haven't, throw it.
[43:12.25]Going up.
[43:12.53]Shit.
[43:12.71]I don't know if we'll hit him in time.
[43:16.77]I got second.
[43:20.61]My God.
[43:21.27]I got second.
[43:24.03]Yeah, Jeremy, if you look at the track and you just see a Wario ahead, just throw it.
[43:28.22]Okay.
[43:32.38]Okay.
[43:35.77]Hey, really clutch endgame there, Mizzy.
[43:38.15]Yeah.
[43:38.73]Oof.
[43:39.25]This is getting rough.
[43:39.91]That track sucks.
[43:40.41]That track is awful.
[43:41.29]That track does suck, but you guys... I'm gonna try something here.
[43:44.52]Tell me if this fixes it.
[43:47.10]I'm very distracted right now.
[43:49.42]Trying to fix this problem.
[43:50.42]But I don't even know what the problem is.
[43:51.74]Tell me if this does anything.
[43:56.72]Oh, shit.
[43:57.16]I think I just turned off my console.
[44:02.72]Oh.
[44:03.88]Oh, God.
[44:04.24]Wait.
[44:05.44]That... Uh-oh.
[44:09.07]I just like refreshed my thing.
[44:10.77]Let's see if this does anything.
[44:11.79]All right, I'm back.
[44:12.57]First.
[44:12.99]Then you got the sixth.
[44:14.41]Yeah, yeah.
[44:14.89]No, you sniped him at the end.
[44:18.51]Nice!
[44:22.32]Lag went away.
[44:22.80]Good job, by the way.
[44:23.46]Saw that ninth place.
[44:24.22]Don't think we didn't see it.
[44:26.72]Did anyone on our team get 12th place?
[44:29.28]No.
[44:30.38]Nice.
[44:31.98]11th.
[44:33.02]Yeah, we did get 11th.
[44:33.95]I will say that.
[44:34.45]I'm not going to name names, but one of us got 11th.
[44:36.67]We don't want to talk about it.
[44:37.59]This track is short.
[44:39.01]Yeah, exactly.
[44:40.43]It is such a short map.
[44:42.87]That's it.
[44:44.05]It dies immediately.
[44:44.81]16 points.
[44:49.70]Dude, I feel like my beetle is not that good because the boost on the beetle is really bad.
[44:55.26]Hey, feel free to switch it up.
[44:57.74]You should go with the wiggly.
[44:58.70]I might.
[44:59.74]I don't think he has the wiggly.
[45:01.18]I'm trying as hard as I can right now.
[45:05.16]This is my worst map.
[45:05.80]If you're Donkey Kong, you can build up speed behind me.
[45:11.55]Yeah, there you go.
[45:13.85]Wait, I got a red.
[45:14.51]He's ever in second.
[45:15.31]I can throw the cunt.
[45:17.45]Yeah.
[45:19.99]Oh.
[45:22.03]Fuck it.
[45:23.13]It's so hard to coordinate who to throw things to.
[45:28.99]What the fuck's that thing?
[45:29.93]Oh yeah, you have to dodge it.
[45:32.46]The scary boy.
[45:34.88]Who's in first?
[45:35.26]I'm in first.
[45:36.04]They have Blue Shirt.
[45:37.84]Oh, who has it?
[45:39.74]Hold Blue Andy.
[45:40.38]That's what you call me.
[45:41.22]There you go.
[45:51.02]I'm gonna light click, click it in front, and you throw a germ, okay?
[45:53.58]Throw it, throw it, throw it.
[45:57.53]Oh, I got bombed.
[45:59.03]No way!
[45:59.75]I just lost, I just lost, I just lost, I just lost.
[46:02.01]I got hit off the edge.
[46:02.77]No, you're good.
[46:03.60]No, I'm not good.
[46:04.20]I'm in level... I lost.
[46:04.88]I really got knocked off the ledge.
[46:08.32]I'm terrible at this game.
[46:18.10]Watch out, I don't want to touch anybody, I'm sorry!
[46:19.56]Oh, that's alright.
[46:21.24]We are all in last place, this is really bad.
[46:23.44]Yeah.
[46:24.10]Yeah, not good, not good, not good.
[46:26.50]Oh, there's a red!
[46:27.02]You got triple reds in second!
[46:28.64]Fuck you, Clint!
[46:29.84]I have blue shell, I have blue shell.
[46:32.78]Should I throw it?
[46:34.42]Yeah, I have blue shell.
[46:36.42]Wait, it's over.
[46:36.94]I got second.
[46:37.48]Aw, damn it.
[46:38.02]We got rocked.
[46:38.56]Fuck.
[46:40.24]I'm down.
[46:41.06]I was literally on the edge, I got hit, knocked off, it was over.
[46:46.19]That was a great play earlier, though, Jerma, when you threw the blue.
[46:49.19]I triple tapped somebody with green shells.
[46:51.25]That was my fault.
[46:52.29]I'm sorry.
[46:53.41]It worked out.
[46:53.99]It worked.
[46:54.42]It just... Clint got double reds behind me in second.
[46:57.32]I couldn't do anything.
[47:03.60]We should still be first, I think.
[47:08.48]Keep the morale up.
[47:09.33]All right.
[47:09.73]Does anybody got a favorite track?
[47:11.60]The baby one.
[47:12.26]The baby.
[47:12.70]We could gamble with baby.
[47:13.50]Let's run baby park.
[47:14.70]Fuck it.
[47:14.92]I had that, man.
[47:15.44]It's in the leaf.
[47:16.56]The animal crossing one.
[47:17.42]Yeah, baby park is pure RNG.
[47:18.60]Did they update it already?
[47:19.42]I'm down for baby park or Yoshi's circle.
[47:22.86]It is a gamble.
[47:23.88]Yoshi's circle, you don't want that.
[47:24.74]That's Clint's best track.
[47:41.28]Really?
[47:41.72]Oh, I love that track.
[47:43.74]Yeah.
[47:43.94]I've never seen Clint lose it.
[47:45.66]Stream looks good now.
[47:46.59]Yeah.
[47:46.79]I'm sorry, guys.
[47:47.53]I have no idea why that was happening.
[47:49.75]This is bizarre.
[47:50.73]Sorry.
[47:51.85]Seems like it's fixed now.
[47:53.31]Let's go.
[47:55.97]Oh, shit.
[47:56.69]We're ahead by like seven points only.
[47:59.60]Six points.
[48:00.04]Okay.
[48:00.76]If you get a mushroom, go through the middle.
[48:02.34]You're probably going to get a mushroom.
[48:03.68]So just be wary and go through the middle.
[48:05.84]It can literally make or break you.
[48:07.72]Okay.
[48:13.94]Hold the mushroom for the middle.
[48:21.70]What hit me?
[48:23.20]I think I just popped... I have shells circling me and I think I got too close.
[48:33.21]Okay.
[48:34.09]It's alright.
[48:38.01]This is what Mario Kart is like now, huh?
[48:40.39]It's fun.
[48:58.43]It's 10 coins for max speed, right?
[49:00.64]Yeah.
[49:01.02]Alright, nice.
[49:13.93]I deserve that.
[49:15.11]Jesus, okay.
[49:17.17]I just ruined Mango's life.
[49:20.29]Okay, I'm right behind Mango now.
[49:23.31]I'm in first.
[49:25.75]Nice.
[49:28.47]I didn't have anything I should have done that.
[49:31.50]Elenity, I'm sorry.
[49:32.68]It's okay.
[49:33.32]Wait, never mind.
[49:33.94]All right, I'm in third.
[49:36.72]My God.
[49:38.54]If anybody gets a blue, call it out and that can go behind.
[49:50.54]Got him.
[49:51.72]I got a bullet, be careful.
[49:52.52]Oh my god, what is going on?
[49:56.40]Shit.
[49:58.14]Clint has a redstone first.
[49:59.24]Oh wait, good blue, good blue.
[50:03.82]Matt, the blue's coming.
[50:04.48]Matt, the blue's coming.
[50:05.06]Blue's coming, guys.
[50:06.04]Fuck!
[50:06.48]I'm good.
[50:08.46]Matt, can I glint?
[50:09.87]I'm not blinded.
[50:10.29]I'm bullet building from the back.
[50:12.97]Please, I swear to god.
[50:14.01]Yeah, you should have used it.
[50:16.33]Who is in first?
[50:17.05]Me.
[50:19.07]You needed to go behind Clint so then the blue would hit him.
[50:20.72]I couldn't.
[50:21.04]I was too far ahead.
[50:21.86]Don't look like you were that far ahead.
[50:25.12]Oh, shit.
[50:27.82]I was getting first.
[50:29.14]I was doing good too.
[50:30.22]Damn it.
[50:31.12]I couldn't.
[50:31.52]I literally stopped.
[50:32.59]Apparently, Clint saw it coming and Clint stopped too.
[50:36.53]That's what happened.
[50:37.07]That's all right.
[50:37.73]We got second, third, and fourth.
[50:39.71]That's good.
[50:40.07]Did we?
[50:40.67]Yeah, we got second, third, and fourth.
[50:42.87]Overall, yeah.
[50:44.56]Oh, overall.
[50:45.84]Yeah, that was overall.
[50:47.29]so someone must have told clint that that was coming and clint stopped as well what should I get for a car for somebody has no idea what's going on what should I do I'm trying to drift I'm trying to learn what do I do drifting too much what car should I have drift more often I don't even remember I think I got no we definitely didn't win that round we definitely lost points I don't want to talk about it I think we lost that one we need to just go through our g here yeah we're probably tied
[51:17.71]We're probably tied.
[51:19.47]Yeah, we were up seven, so I think it's going to be very close.
[51:21.65]Do you guys want to comment on why you are so adamant on going to Baby Park?
[51:27.15]RNG, baby.
[51:27.79]Lud, you live towards me, okay?
[51:28.95]You love to gamble.
[51:30.28]Yeah.
[51:30.80]Actually, I'm now swayed.
[51:32.74]I'm on your side.
[51:34.26]It is all... Okay.
[51:35.18]It's been clinched track twice?
[51:36.84]It's been clinched track twice in a row.
[51:38.42]Lud, you want to talk about this?
[51:39.74]You want to talk about this?
[51:40.36]A little weird.
[51:41.36]A little weird?
[51:42.90]Okay.
[51:43.16]It's updated.
[51:44.04]We are... Ooh.
[51:45.66]We're losing by two points, guys.
[51:47.82]Okay.
[51:48.34]Okay.
[51:48.64]I can't come in last place.
[51:50.40]I'm trying.
[51:51.08]I'm trying not to have that happen.
[51:53.00]No, no Nev's on the side early because then you get full coins.
[51:58.54]Oh, do you?
[51:59.75]Yes.
[52:04.57]I didn't take your advice.
[52:05.53]Yeah, me neither.
[52:07.01]I forgot where it was.
[52:08.51]Okay, I did.
[52:08.81]I'm with you, Preso, in third.
[52:19.21]I'm with you, Preso.
[52:25.70]He's got, he's got a bomb.
[52:28.87]I always got bombs, man.
[52:38.03]No, you pushed me.
[52:39.03]I'm sorry.
[52:39.63]I forgot I'm like live on your guys' channels.
[52:41.31]I'm sorry.
[52:43.87]What the hell just happened?
[52:46.39]I'm getting fucked up a bit.
[52:48.39]I'm in third behind you, President.
[52:50.21]Why did I even get hit by it?
[53:04.11]uh preso I have a red if you want to toss that I'll get in front and toss it again sure let me get oh wow guys guys guys uh connecting time so this is a four fun race uh wait what happened wubby's thing disconnected uh he's in the in the lobby still he just for some reason it loaded longer than everyone else
[53:29.35]So this is purely for fun race.
[53:31.23]It won't count.
[53:31.79]And if it happens again, we'll just remove like bottom two scores.
[53:35.27]Exhibition.
[53:36.65]Dude, I hate people that just make us like have to wait all the time.
[53:39.97]It just drives me nuts.
[53:41.46]Like, I don't know.
[53:44.36]I'd say just get him out of here.
[53:47.96]Hogging you is just like biting my tongue, bro.
[53:51.62]This is an obstacle course.
[53:53.00]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[53:54.04]That's right.
[53:59.55]Taking out Connor.
[53:59.91]I don't think he's holding me back because of you guys, man.
[54:02.27]Taking out Connor part two.
[54:05.03]He wasn't expecting that one.
[54:06.19]It worked the second time.
[54:09.46]No!
[54:11.64]You suck.
[54:15.10]Hurry up.
[54:15.52]Why am I so slow?
[54:17.49]Go same map.
[54:18.19]Go same map.
[54:21.71]You're trying so hard.
[54:22.85]I really am.
[54:23.23]I don't want to come in last place every time.
[54:31.80]Now the final score is fucked.
[54:33.73]That was weird, though, because I saw Pape money right next to me the whole time.
[54:37.89]Yeah, was it a bot?
[54:39.61]No, wait, wait.
[54:41.13]Lud, you want us to all just click F-Zero, right?
[54:44.33]Oh, I didn't do that, my B. Oh, I thought we had to hit F-Zero.
[54:47.46]Yeah, you're right.
[54:48.12]No, you're right.
[54:48.82]I wasn't paying attention.
[54:50.28]Neither was Prezzo.
[54:51.64]Where's F-Zero?
[54:52.74]I don't see it.
[55:01.32]Why am I listening to directions for once?
[55:03.53]Dude, this is fun as fuck.
[55:04.61]We should just, like, once a week.
[55:07.83]Yeah, the problem is that we selected 12 races, so even though we want to play another, we'll have to... Somebody said, this guy sucks.
[55:16.15]I've played Mario Kart, like, three times.
[55:20.33]I'm trying.
[55:24.27]This is a very close win and loss.
[55:25.87]Like, these teams are pretty tight.
[55:28.59]We need to just get first, second, and third.
[55:31.26]because it just powers you.
[55:32.44]We need to get top two.
[55:33.54]All right.
[55:35.02]Top two right here.
[55:35.80]I got you.
[55:36.16]Mango and Clint are currently top two.
[55:39.11]Jerma, this is all you, okay?
[55:41.59]Yeah.
[55:42.89]Get that bull, Bill.
[55:43.57]Make us win.
[55:44.17]Top three?
[55:44.77]All right.
[55:44.97]You got it.
[55:52.35]Damn.
[55:52.73]First place is so far ahead.
[55:55.39]Let's go.
[55:57.49]Oh, that's you, Prezzo?
[55:59.07]Yeah.
[55:59.75]Hell yeah.
[56:05.09]Hey.
[56:05.59]Jesus Christ, Clint.
[56:11.49]Oh, I got bumped off the stage.
[56:15.09]Oh!
[56:16.19]I lost my audio.
[56:17.13]Right behind you.
[56:18.69]Alright.
[56:20.59]Oh, I hit Clint.
[56:25.40]Almost followed him off.
[56:26.18]Alright.
[56:26.76]I got two reds in first.
[56:28.10]As long as I drive good, I should be fine.
[56:30.48]Okay.
[56:33.40]Oh shit.
[56:33.66]I've got no coins.
[56:35.50]I'm right in front of Clint, or my Clint.
[56:37.58]Clint has a thing, so he's safe right now.
[56:39.82]I can't do anything to him.
[56:40.56]Okay, he used it.
[56:41.90]Aggressive.
[56:46.28]Who's in fifth?
[56:49.00]Me.
[56:51.26]Me and Illini.
[57:05.63]I'm getting destroyed.
[57:13.37]Oh my god, I'm racing my heart out and I'm not making any progress.
[57:18.73]Anyone on 6?
[57:30.79]Secured 12.
[57:41.66]Is one of us in 10th?
[57:44.38]Speak now.
[57:45.10]I'm about to grip it.
[57:49.32]Alright, Clint got first.
[57:50.80]I got second.
[57:53.02]I simply got third.
[57:53.82]I hit him with the red shell really fucking strategically, but he still fucking got ahead.
[57:58.26]I got fourth.
[58:03.29]I very strategically fucking smacked him.
[58:06.67]That was a tough one.
[58:09.85]That was bad.
[58:10.51]Hey, for both of us though.
[58:13.35]Damn.
[58:15.19]Oh god.
[58:17.13]I even got hit from behind by a red shell.
[58:19.31]I'm all in on the baby park idea.
[58:21.56]Yeah, I said, you know, let's do it.
[58:23.38]It's in the Leaf Cup.
[58:25.04]When people say I'm wicked embarrassed for you, stop it!
[58:29.26]I'm probably like bright red.
[58:32.49]I may as, honestly, like I may as well have my fucking pants and underwear down right here in front of everybody.
[58:41.57]Where are we going?
[58:43.27]Oh, baby part.
[58:44.03]Oh, baby part.
[58:44.63]It is pure RNG.
[58:46.07]How are we going to run the next race?
[58:48.27]Two more races?
[58:49.17]We're just going to boot up the next one as like an individual race.
[58:53.57]Okay.
[58:54.02]I got it.
[58:54.26]Because you can just keep the lobby.
[58:55.86]Yeah.
[58:56.86]So just boot up one more after this.
[58:58.70]It might make you do four, but we'll just back out.
[59:00.90]All right.
[59:01.30]Here we go, baby.
[59:02.20]We got it.
[59:03.40]This is either going to be really good or really bad.
[59:05.46]Get items.
[59:06.02]Just go for items.
[59:06.80]We are 20 points behind.
[59:08.70]Yeah.
[59:12.54]We need top four here.
[59:13.84]We need, we need crazy numbers here.
[59:15.19]Okay.
[59:16.51]The problem is our, our last, we're getting last place too much.
[59:19.41]We need like the middles.
[59:21.09]I'm sorry.
[59:22.55]That's okay.
[59:22.97]Yeah, no, that's a little bit of me.
[59:24.98]No, it's okay.
[59:25.24]It's okay.
[59:27.12]We'll, we'll save it right here.
[59:27.90]Me and Connor.
[59:28.36]Of course.
[59:45.80]I've got a red watch out cool what place you in welcome baby mark how did that hit I don't know who that hit this is a disaster I'm just not getting anything oh my god I do like I do like the music a lot
[60:15.22]I got Bull Bill going from 10.
[60:16.04]Oh, weird.
[60:18.96]I don't know.
[60:21.81]Uh... We need Miracle?
[60:26.63]No!
[60:28.11]Oh, give me a fucking Miracle!
[60:29.63]I got a little bit of a... Oh, I got hit by something.
[60:35.38]We lost, we lost, we lost duty.
[60:44.52]Oh, the lightning.
[60:47.90]Decent.
[60:49.39]I got, I got, literally, I got 11 places.
[60:51.43]I'm getting eight.
[60:52.79]Damn it.
[60:53.35]Dude, Wario's, Wario's got top three.
[60:56.27]That sucks.
[60:57.31]That's bad.
[60:58.33]This plan did not work.
[61:01.03]That's over.
[61:01.55]It's over.
[61:02.12]That was America's funniest home video.
[61:03.86]All we got to do is go one, two, three, four, five, six in the next race.
[61:06.58]We got one more race.
[61:10.10]In that map, if you get hit... To me, that was like a... That was like a Leslie Nielsen movie.
[61:18.17]Where he's... He somehow got into being a conductor at an orchestra.
[61:22.83]And he's trying to find the person that's in the audience that's the criminal.
[61:25.95]And he's like... And he's trying to find a place.
[61:30.04]He's trying to find a guy.
[61:33.64]He's a great actor.
[61:35.82]What's our best track?
[61:39.83]Baby Park.
[61:40.63]We need a miracle to get all of us in Pop 6.
[61:42.91]Oh, yeah.
[61:45.53]Baby Park.
[61:46.23]Oh, we need to do Baby Park again?
[61:50.17]I mean, I don't know what the best way is.
[61:52.41]Depressed.
[61:52.73]Oh, there's no way we can win this.
[62:02.67]No, it's not.
[62:03.11]We went for the Hail Mary and it didn't pay off.
[62:05.55]I think if you get 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th, you might win.
[62:09.77]That's what I said.
[62:12.01]It's going to be really difficult, though.
[62:17.81]I picked Baby Park again somehow?
[62:20.19]That's fine.
[62:22.11]You wanted it bad.
[62:24.14]Maybe we'll go in there.
[62:25.72]I should go there.
[62:31.90]Harbor I fuck with it.
[62:34.22]I mean the best race of your life.
[62:36.10]All right I'm gonna get first The cart that they're using is definitely better this thing doesn't get nearly like look how fast clink goes out I
[63:04.36]I just saw a bunch of people go that way and I just fucking was an ant.
[63:06.80]Yeah, I got bumped into it.
[63:08.28]Oh my god, this car sucks.
[63:15.19]What was I thinking?
[63:15.91]Alright, I'm in first.
[63:29.97]I'm second.
[63:32.17]I'm second.
[63:32.87]Okay, I'm third now.
[63:36.81]Oh god.
[63:46.87]It's going pretty alright so far.
[63:48.59]Oh, I got bolded.
[63:49.89]Wow.
[63:50.41]Simply double-fired bold me.
[63:52.95]I've never seen that happen before.
[63:54.67]Yeah, that sucks.
[63:56.15]Eleni!
[63:56.27]Eleni, get in second!
[63:56.98]Get in second!
[63:57.74]Oh, fuck.
[63:59.72]Damn it.
[64:00.12]I should have just kept going.
[64:02.14]Fuck.
[64:04.64]Nate, use yours.
[64:06.41]Got it.
[64:10.79]I'm not trying to hit you.
[64:17.63]I hate this game.
[64:19.35]What a bounce.
[64:20.33]What a fucking bounce that was.
[64:21.93]What are these fireballs coming around the corner?
[64:24.46]What?
[64:25.22]Yeah.
[64:30.09]Okay, I got sixth.
[64:31.11]You guys just gotta get first through fifth.
[64:32.95]Yeah, this isn't amazing.
[64:34.13]Okay.
[64:35.17]No, the trolley!
[64:38.32]Fourth?
[64:39.80]Oh, come on!
[64:41.54]What happened?
[64:48.25]I've got two Yoshis in front.
[64:56.39]Am I behind you, miss?
[64:57.99]You just hit him.
[64:58.71]The shell just hit somebody.
[65:09.07]Oh, great.
[65:14.52]I just told my chat this, but I'll just say it's all yours.
[65:17.92]This is like as embarrassing if I was to pull my fucking pants down in my underwear.
[65:21.90]And I'm on stage and you're all there.
[65:25.31]This is like, I'm in a dream.
[65:27.45]Yeah, this wasn't good.
[65:28.87]This wasn't great.
[65:30.59]Oh, I was racing so well.
[65:32.91]I was doing so well.
[65:33.91]No.
[65:35.41]Is it possible to end the race early, Connor?
[65:40.15]It's over.
[65:41.27]I'm not sure.
[65:42.15]Let me see.
[65:42.96]Or do we have to make a lobby again?
[65:44.68]Holy shit, that was bad.
[65:49.90]I severely underestimated how much better everybody at Mario Kart was in this call.
[65:56.54]I thought we were going to be driving backwards driving into people.
[66:01.84]People were good.
[66:03.61]This is good.
[66:04.19]I don't want to skip free-for-all.
[66:08.27]I'll do this again another week, but we are moving over to free-for-all.
[66:12.18]Connor, you can just close out this lobby and make a new one.
[66:15.64]Are they going to come in here and shit on us?
[66:17.44]You did lose.
[66:18.44]I don't know if they'll shit on you, but they did beat you.
[66:21.68]Should I change my character?
[66:22.61]Should we go to the free-for-all chat or what?
[66:24.65]Yeah, go to the free-for-all chat and this lobby, make a new one, and join the new lobby.
[66:31.39]I'm going to go with a new character.
[66:34.16]It was a bad character?
[66:35.12]No offense, I mean this with peace and love, Jeremy.
[66:45.43]You suck.
[66:48.03]Yeah, I'm... I feel like 75% of my in-game time in Mario Kart 8 has been with you.
[66:57.43]All of you.
[66:59.99]So what should I do?
[67:00.79]How do I pull this back?
[67:05.19]more speed all right so I should get more speed well let me unlock some of this stuff because I got we had to make new accounts longer drifts who should I what should I play with what character
[67:37.30]The goal is to get first place.
[67:38.70]Yeah, it is.
[67:48.68]The thing is, I like played a little bit off stream and I was like, oh, okay, this is going well.
[67:53.02]No.
[67:54.18]No, not at all.
[67:58.41]I gotta join this thing.
[67:59.07]I don't know, I think a lot of them left.
[68:05.33]But some of us are still playing.
[68:11.60]it's only it says you're playing yeah I didn't leave I think we're supposed to leave but no I I'm making a new group okay I got you connor I'm gonna go to the bathroom real fast did it close the entire lobby so who's who's a good character then what should I play as character oh wait that was like advice
[68:40.90]Character.
[68:41.58]Any level 3 heavy, such as Bowser, Wario, or Morton.
[68:45.66]Pipeframe card.
[68:46.54]Blue Falcon and Streedle are ideal.
[68:48.22]Alright, Streedle.
[68:51.32]So I'm going to go with Morton and Streedle.
[68:54.20]Because I don't think I have the other one unlocked.
[69:02.55]Alright.
[69:05.96]You're not good enough for heavies?
[69:08.01]Well, I mean, I just, I've literally come in ninth through twelfth place every single time.
[69:20.31]It's not, I don't have those unlocked?
[69:24.31]You can also press the button to make the car move.
[69:32.54]Fuck.
[69:36.85]Alright, I'll try this, this Freedle.
[69:39.08]And, like, Morton.
[69:41.76]Use a bike?
[69:42.26]I was, like, kind of good with the bike, but I had, like, I had different tires unlocked.
[69:47.04]Wood.
[69:47.44]I was using wood tires and a little scooter.
[69:49.34]Alright, well, I'm gonna go for it.
[69:53.02]I don't have wood right now.
[69:53.76]I don't have it unlocked.
[69:56.48]You're so annoying.
[69:58.04]If it makes you feel any better, I have a lot of fun doing it.
[70:00.54]So, you're, you're making my, my time better.
[70:03.85]Oh, XQCL.
[70:04.41]You're welcome, buddy.
[70:06.48]Thank you.
[70:06.94]Is he like that Yoshi circuit, dude?
[70:08.70]I literally, I told them.
[70:11.50]They were all picking Yoshis and I'm like... If there was no items, I was gonna win.
[70:16.40]That's bullshit.
[70:17.45]It literally happened the entire time.
[70:20.69]Oh, that's why... What kind of wheel should I get?
[70:23.25]I could be in there like, oh, let's have a little bit of fun banter.
[70:27.55]No.
[70:27.95]Hey, guys.
[70:28.89]What do I do?
[70:29.95]What wheel should I get?
[70:36.76]Rollers?
[70:38.34]Like this?
[70:38.72]Okay, roller.
[70:41.72]Like that?
[70:42.94]And then what should I get?
[70:46.78]Parachute?
[70:58.77]Any glider doesn't matter?
[70:59.83]Okay.
[71:05.66]I kind of want to wait just because I feel like people will join off me.
[71:17.23]Yeah, you should join last.
[71:19.06]What do you guys mean slick wheels?
[71:21.04]What does slick wheels mean?
[71:23.48]Slick wheels?
[71:27.92]How do I do that?
[71:34.40]Slick, slick, slick, slick.
[71:35.38]Don't do slick.
[71:35.98]They're called slick.
[71:39.52]Slim.
[71:39.82]I don't think I have them.
[71:43.00]I'm going to go with this.
[71:43.56]This looks pretty balanced.
[71:47.10]Whoever's the best by league at the end of June.
[71:49.20]Oh, yeah?
[71:49.76]Hey, yeah.
[71:50.78]Let's do that.
[71:53.84]So, this race is going to be $3,000 in the line, $1,500 for first, $750 for second, $500 for third, and $250 for fourth.
[72:03.92]We also have a secret prize for 11th place.
[72:06.85]That's me.
[72:09.27]Legally, that's me.
[72:10.11]I think I got 11th seven times.
[72:11.43]For whatever reason, you happen to be in the back for a lot of the team's event.
[72:15.79]11th does have a special prize, so it will be worth your while to a fight for not dead last.
[72:21.46]Yeah.
[72:23.87]It'll also be 12 races.
[72:24.69]Is it 12 races?
[72:25.57]Okay.
[72:25.99]Yep.
[72:26.85]It should go about an hour.
[72:28.61]And everyone, if you can, get the streams going.
[72:31.65]Everyone who had it in the last time, get them going again.
[72:34.87]Yeah, I couldn't figure out how to do that.
[72:37.34]No worries.
[72:37.90]A lot of you did get it, and they were sick.
[72:39.90]Connors was fire.
[72:42.42]How do you guys stream from like a capture card, though?
[72:46.61]Oh, because I use a two-computer setup.
[72:48.65]I can't.
[72:49.23]I use a two-PC setup, so I won't be able to do that.
[72:53.19]I do not want to talk with all of you guys here.
[72:54.90]Can I go in my own little lobby, Lug?
[72:56.92]Just deafen.
[72:57.44]Just deafen.
[72:58.44]Okay.
[72:59.42]Is there any rulings on voting maps?
[73:03.34]Vote for whatever map you want, and that's totally legal because it's a 1 in 12 chance.
[73:07.16]You're fighting for yourself here.
[73:08.90]I wasn't ready.
[73:09.62]Uh-oh.
[73:10.46]Just don't run a repeat.
[73:12.32]I picked the wrong bike.
[73:13.30]That's okay.
[73:13.58]I don't need it.
[73:15.05]Alright, so, let's go.
[73:18.79]Let's go, let's go, right?
[73:20.17]Like, come on, I can't, like, I've got a... I can't be the guy that's, like, the two-year-old.
[73:26.35]Where you just lie to me and tell me that I got in, like, fourth place.
[73:32.42]It's the little brother.
[73:33.50]It's the little brother.
[73:34.46]Hey, yeah, no, what place did I get?
[73:36.46]You got fourth.
[73:37.74]You came in last every time.
[73:38.74]Alright, let's go, let's go, alright.
[73:41.06]I'm not, I'm in my own thing.
[73:44.09]Let's do it.
[73:44.95]I'm ready.
[73:47.49]Come on.
[74:02.83]Oh, shit.
[74:33.17]I gotta make some ground up here.
[74:34.18]Somebody just threw a fucking cone at me.
[74:55.91]That just fucked me up so bad.
[74:57.19]It was just a huge nuke on the screen.
[75:33.17]Let's go, boys!
[75:55.74]I just went from eighth to second right at the end, by the way.
[76:00.60]I went from eighth to second right at the end.
[76:04.88]I do not know how I did that.
[76:06.62]Mango threw a bomb.
[76:07.45]Mango, thank you, buddy.
[76:09.47]Thank you.
[76:09.99]Dude, you got me from seventh to third.
[76:11.93]I went from eighth to second just with the mushrooms in the corner.
[76:14.47]I helped the wrong people.
[76:15.43]I went from first to ninth.
[76:27.03]Dude, Jerma, I felt like crap, man.
[76:30.29]No!
[76:32.35]That was the first.
[76:33.51]I've been in 12th place the entire time we've been playing.
[76:37.02]Jerma was in second place for a second.
[76:38.80]Hey, not that one, my friend.
[76:39.86]Don't forget about the 11th place prize, Jerma, alright?
[76:42.24]That's big.
[76:42.94]I know.
[76:43.88]It is big.
[76:46.86]I'm sorry, buddy.
[76:47.96]It's okay.
[76:49.84]If it makes you feel any better, I got third.
[76:52.34]I still got fifth.
[76:53.24]I'm not out.
[76:54.85]No, that's good.
[76:55.91]That is pretty good.
[76:57.83]Whoever did that lightning at the end is a hero.
[77:00.75]That saved Mango.
[77:04.94]If Mango was about to get hit by a blue shell, the lightning hit was a DR. Perfect timing.
[77:08.94]Mango, did you drop the bomb?
[77:10.08]Yeah, that was my bomb.
[77:11.78]Mango, you fucked me so bad.
[77:15.62]That was sick.
[77:17.30]I need peace and quiet.
[77:18.76]I need quiet.
[77:19.52]My brain can't function without it.
[77:52.72]What the fuck was that?
[78:08.30]GOD DAMMIT!
[78:08.92]I think that drift, right?
[78:31.35]I only have one coin.
[79:14.23]God damn it, man!
[79:20.46]Oh, come on!
[79:27.34]And I got a lightning bolt, use it now!
[79:51.83]I thought it was funny.
[79:53.25]Oh my god.
[79:54.61]My hands are sweating so much right now.
[79:56.27]Thank you so much, Renekton.
[79:57.65]And then Mango just kept going.
[79:58.89]I was like, wow.
[79:59.76]Lucio couldn't hit Mango with a one.
[80:02.60]I told you about it.
[80:03.88]I am very sorry.
[80:05.18]I actually didn't do that on purpose.
[80:07.40]I'm lucky.
[80:09.04]It's been all day.
[80:10.62]Yeah.
[80:11.30]Clint's looking a little lost without his support system there.
[80:13.80]Dude, Mango.
[80:14.76]Looking a little lost.
[80:15.60]I'm going to rattle off some wins here.
[80:17.55]Okay.
[80:18.69]I haven't seen you all game.
[80:19.65]I didn't add a roll.
[80:21.31]I'm so fucked.
[80:24.19]Everybody's saying I don't deserve fifth.
[80:25.70]I know I don't, but isn't that how Mario Kart works?
[80:28.36]That is how it works.
[80:29.74]Using the word deserve when there's a giant blue shell that goes from 12th to first to light them up.
[80:35.08]It's a little ironic.
[80:36.04]Clint, what did you get that round?
[80:38.16]Seven.
[80:40.07]You saying stop tryharding did I have to at least not come in last place man Simply was nasty in teams.
[80:44.51]What's going on?
[80:45.17]I don't want to fuck with that at all.
[80:47.03]I
[81:09.39]Walking into the boost.
[81:21.36]Come on.
[81:51.84]Come on, give me a- I need both coins.
[81:53.58]Now.
[81:58.51]Shit, already a lightning bolt?
[82:02.03]Where are they going?
[82:02.97]I'm going this way.
[82:18.84]I'm fucking somebody right now.
[82:19.92]I'm just going to screw somebody over.
[82:35.13]How am I still in 11th place?
[82:42.55]What the fuck is this thing?
[82:45.20]Whoa!
[82:45.50]Alright, come on!
[82:59.00]Let's go!
[83:00.58]Give me another like guaranteed victory!
[83:28.23]Oh, get away from me.
[83:28.75]Get away.
[83:28.97]Get away.
[83:29.19]Come on.
[83:35.32]Give me a Bullet Bill right here.
[83:50.74]Oh my god.
[83:52.44]Jesus.
[83:53.20]I'm getting fucked.
[83:53.87]I'm getting fucked.
[83:54.49]I'm so fucking sad.
[83:55.91]I'm getting fucked.
[83:56.91]I'm getting fucked.
[83:58.95]I'm getting fucked.
[84:00.27]I got green shelled.
[84:02.05]I got fucked.
[84:03.11]I got fucked.
[84:06.23]I think I got three.
[84:07.37]I think I got three blue shells that time.
[84:08.93]I'm sorry, everybody.
[84:09.71]Sorry, brother.
[84:10.17]Oh, man.
[84:12.37]Clint had a lead for a year, got hit by a blue shell, a red shell, and it was GG.
[84:17.38]Yeah, dude.
[84:21.31]Prezzo, I had a channel bet whether you would get first place or not, and 90% of people lost all their channel points.
[84:26.91]Let's go!
[84:28.59]Prezzo, you got first?
[84:31.00]Yeah, I got first.
[84:32.20]The prediction was literally, will Prezzo get first?
[84:34.06]Dude, this shit will double my bank account.
[84:37.24]Just let me have this.
[84:37.98]Oh god, not this map.
[84:40.00]Was this the one with the sand that sucks you in the middle?
[84:43.11]Yes.
[84:43.79]Oh shit.
[84:44.91]Alright, I've got this.
[84:50.63]Do you think that quicksand would give a good like blow job?
[84:53.27]Oh, yeah.
[84:54.89]I'm sorry.
[84:55.51]I thought I was muted.
[84:56.33]I thought I was talking to my chair.
[84:57.49]I just fucked up.
[85:15.72]Oh, my goodness.
[85:18.98]Oh my goodness, this thing sucks.
[85:34.16]I just hear Arnold.
[85:36.06]All I hear is... That's all I hear, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[85:50.21]Oh my fucking god, are you kidding me?
[85:52.20]Alright, it's not over.
[86:22.83]There's so many Bullet Bills!
[86:24.15]Dammit!
[86:37.78]Don't hit me!
[86:38.18]Don't hit me!
[86:38.50]Please don't hit me!
[86:38.90]You're behind me!
[86:39.32]Please don't hit me!
[86:39.74]Please, please, please don't do it!
[87:06.43]Oh!
[87:09.96]Don't!
[87:10.86]Fuck, that was, that was done for!
[87:12.40]Ugh!
[87:33.19]Somebody said somebody's using a hacked switch.
[87:34.49]Going for 11th place?
[87:36.43]Yes, I'm going for it now, Ludd.
[87:38.45]I'm hit by everything, starting with the simply, dodging, grabbing my double items, hitting me with it.
[87:47.04]Yeah, did those fireballs hit you by chance?
[87:48.90]I threw a couple back.
[87:50.90]Shut up.
[87:51.22]The fireballs hit me when I was in fourth at the end, and I finished 11th.
[87:55.32]I'm desperately just trying to not be in last place.
[87:59.71]Dude, it's the spike.
[88:00.69]I'm not playing with it anymore.
[88:03.38]Oh my god, that was dreadful.
[88:07.00]It's definitely the bike, for sure.
[88:11.34]You sound like a flustered grandma.
[88:12.76]I probably could be your grandma right now.
[88:16.12]I mean, I'm probably old enough to be your grandma.
[88:18.61]And I'm kind of flustered.
[88:20.13]So it makes a little sense.
[88:22.71]Just get away from me.
[88:23.53]I don't want any problems.
[88:25.49]I don't like to go near you at all.
[88:26.89]It's you.
[88:35.34]Wait, Clint, what place did you get?
[88:37.62]Second.
[88:37.88]Alright, let's go.
[88:38.96]Let's do it.
[88:39.32]Alright, this is my natural position.
[88:42.11]Alright, concentration.
[88:43.31]Let me try to get first.
[88:45.15]I can't believe I had first the first game.
[89:01.15]What happened?
[89:02.57]What the fuck was that?
[89:14.82]Oh shit, that could have been me.
[89:16.70]That could have been me.
[89:28.60]Oh shit.
[89:29.62]I have zero fucking coins?
[89:47.06]I need to collect coins right now.
[89:49.20]It's coin collection time.
[89:50.26]Give me those!
[89:59.47]I fucking missed all the coins!
[90:09.35]Holy shit, that went right by me.
[90:20.56]Get out of the way.
[90:28.08]Hmm.
[90:46.19]Hmm.
[90:51.20]I'm so slow, hurry up!
[91:04.71]Dude, Charlie, you got mega fucked.
[91:08.83]Dead air.
[91:09.77]I'm trying so hard to concentrate.
[91:14.08]This is the worst moment of my life.
[91:16.04]I'll take that.
[91:16.72]I'll take that.
[91:17.78]I'll take that.
[91:19.44]Wait, how did I just got first place if I got fifth?
[91:23.14]Is it because everybody that was ahead of me just got screwed over?
[91:26.30]Yeah, there was nonstop bumper cars at the end.
[91:29.14]That was pure luck whoever got top five.
[91:31.86]Yeah, it kind of was.
[91:33.42]I will say Clint had no competition for first on that one.
[91:36.18]No, he didn't.
[91:37.11]He did not.
[91:37.53]I mean, Charlie was close and then I hit him like three times.
[91:43.18]Remember, we're having fun.
[91:44.16]Stop stressing.
[91:45.80]I'm just fucking around.
[91:46.73]Don't worry.
[91:49.21]Never, ever talk to this man or note him.
[91:51.41]That was fucked up, dude.
[91:52.37]Wait, Alina, you're in first place?
[91:54.13]You dropped that bomb in the first round.
[91:55.63]What do you want from me?
[91:56.41]You should pay me back.
[91:58.55]Wait, what?
[91:59.03]Who's in first?
[91:59.89]Who's in first?
[92:00.69]Right now, Alina is in first place.
[92:02.31]I mean, you guys do understand that the last game, whatever we play, I'm going to drive the wrong way and just try to drive into the person in first place.
[92:09.68]You understand that, right?
[92:12.03]become inaccurate if someone drops or something oh no that's such a bm like I don't think I could get away with it in the race for the money who are oh I'm in 11 people there's only one money at the bottom oh this is what I'm talking about who's in sixth uh sixth place is prezzo and he's tied with connor or no one behind connor who's the seventh
[92:37.48]Uh, Charlie, you're in eighth, bro.
[92:40.61]I keep asking until I find out where I am.
[92:43.21]You're in eighth place.
[92:45.47]Yeah, that 12th place lead hit me pretty hard.
[92:52.81]I need coins.
[93:13.76]There's bananas everywhere, Jesus.
[93:15.46]There is a lot of bananas.
[93:17.20]I know, they're everywhere.
[93:17.98]It's insane.
[93:25.97]Dude, Baby Park is the one map where I, like, lean with every turn.
[93:30.03]Like, my body holding the controller can't stay still.
[93:33.15]Fuck.
[93:37.78]Fuck.
[93:43.12]Oh, don't touch me.
[93:43.80]And there I go.
[93:44.78]There goes my lead.
[93:45.84]What the fuck?
[93:50.24]There goes everything I've worked for in life.
[93:51.94]It's over.
[93:52.28]Oh my god.
[93:54.19]That was a perfect time.
[94:01.73]Disaster.
[94:03.43]That was perfect timing to use the star.
[94:10.20]I played that so well, and I still got 9th.
[94:14.10]I clutched every turn, and then one red hits me.
[94:17.70]We just got a new sponsor coming in.
[94:19.68]There's a secret gift for random placing between 5th and 12th.
[94:24.48]What?
[94:25.06]Oh, that's big.
[94:26.78]Random number generator 5 through 12, and then one of them.
[94:29.04]No, I wouldn't do that, Clint.
[94:34.46]What's the shittiest one?
[94:35.20]Grumble Volcano, right?
[94:38.02]It's one in what way?
[94:39.72]Grumble Volcano is like the worst.
[94:41.20]I like Grumble.
[94:42.40]I like it actually.
[94:43.59]Oh.
[94:43.75]Alright.
[94:44.57]Cool.
[94:45.71]Clint, pick moving metals or you're scared.
[94:46.85]If you have the Bowser's Castles, I think people are pretty bad at it.
[94:57.24]Toad's Turnpike?
[95:00.46]Oh shit.
[95:00.92]Is it actually going to do it?
[95:01.64]No.
[95:03.98]Let Jex play.
[95:06.76]I've definitely improved, okay?
[95:09.00]Like, the first, like, four or five races, especially, I literally had blindfold on.
[95:13.70]Alright, I got, I got at least placed in the top six.
[95:18.47]Let's go.
[95:23.21]Hold on, eyes, eyes, my eyes.
[95:24.57]That's what you get, you gotta knock somebody out right at the beginning.
[95:53.88]It's fine.
[95:55.64]Relax.
[95:56.64]Like five people just did that.
[96:01.02]Oh, fuck that.
[96:01.69]No.
[96:01.81]Whoa.
[96:18.12]Whoa.
[96:19.72]Whoa.
[96:33.97]What hit me?
[96:34.55]Oh, watch this shit.
[96:42.28]How do I cycle between items?
[96:44.92]How do you cycle between items?
[96:46.62]I'm gonna hold this to the very end.
[96:50.36]How do you cycle between items?
[96:52.32]I can't.
[96:53.71]What?
[96:53.93]What just fucking happened?
[96:54.91]Did I just get the same two items again?
[96:59.19]Just use it, whatever.
[97:18.99]Seventh fucking place, whatever.
[97:21.93]Tight squeeze.
[97:23.11]That lag was fucking brutal.
[97:24.91]Oh, that was bad for me.
[97:28.42]Just keep getting last place, man.
[97:29.86]It's really unfortunate.
[97:31.36]Why did he sit there?
[97:32.34]Simply?
[97:33.76]He's playing for a long time.
[97:35.70]My controller.
[97:37.46]I'm just gonna start waiting non-stop.
[97:42.19]How many more races do we have?
[97:46.05]I believe that was...
[97:48.48]There's still plenty of time to pull this back.
[97:54.37]Oh, plenty of time.
[97:55.51]That's what I was thinking.
[97:56.79]I'm going to get first place every time now.
[97:58.05]I'm actually going to start playing.
[98:03.19]Whoever used lightning in the last game is a fucking hero.
[98:07.34]Clint, didn't you have a star during that too?
[98:11.28]I did.
[98:12.18]I had a star during that.
[98:13.24]Are you trying to imply that I don't deserve to get second because I get a star?
[98:18.26]Yes.
[98:18.86]I think third is more up your alley, you know?
[98:20.56]Alright, we'll see on this one.
[98:23.76]Somebody said, do the imposter his sus face.
[98:28.33]No.
[98:29.27]Just go Google it.
[98:30.35]That's okay.
[98:35.87]I'm still in eighth place, so.
[98:36.97]I think both of us are tied for eighth.
[98:38.76]I don't know why I'm so cocky.
[98:40.26]Really?
[98:40.54]Yeah.
[98:40.80]I think so.
[98:41.06]I don't know why I'm so cocky.
[98:41.76]Woohoo!
[98:49.36]Oh, that's a traffic jam.
[98:50.32]It turned into a bloodbath immediately.
[98:55.96]Oh, fuck.
[98:57.36]Oh, that was a scary thing.
[99:01.84]Okay.
[99:02.00]Oh my goodness, this place is ridiculous.
[99:04.18]Okay.
[99:06.21]Okay.
[99:10.45]Oh, I hit his hand.
[99:11.71]I just jumped over that.
[99:13.85]I can't believe I jumped over it.
[99:17.83]This map is wacky.
[99:35.80]Shit.
[99:37.14]Alright, back in it.
[99:41.12]Dude, how am I so far away?
[99:42.79]It's absurd.
[99:48.99]No, no, no turn I I lost I lost How'd you get in first this one, please?
[99:58.68]Okay Fuck Karma Clint, where are you?
[100:05.86]He's first He's in first, but he's muted If you just keep asking him questions, he'll get rattled Me and Manga are going after him
[100:18.59]Oh, come on.
[100:20.47]Shit.
[100:24.33]Worst moment of my life.
[100:28.12]Come on.
[100:28.86]No, get away from me.
[100:32.80]No!
[100:39.56]Slow down.
[100:40.96]Oh, you juked me.
[100:44.37]Oh my god, Mayor.
[100:45.37]Are you fucking kidding me?
[100:46.39]How did you dodge that bomb?
[100:52.17]Oh.
[101:04.17]Charlie, you are the worst one I've ever had in my life!
[101:08.13]You rammed me, man!
[101:10.05]Did Clint drive off the level?
[101:12.01]What happened there?
[101:13.01]Yeah, I drove off the level.
[101:15.18]That was one of the greatest plays of all time and then drove off the level.
[101:20.26]Charlie, that was so unnecessary.
[101:22.14]You rammed me!
[101:23.10]I'm so sorry.
[101:24.18]Wait, how did I get second?
[101:26.28]Is this my first time playing Mario Kart?
[101:27.97]No, but come on.
[101:28.89]You should go overall again.
[101:31.15]Indeed, I'm getting fucked and I'm still in third.
[101:34.71]Miss, you know the little teddy bears you guys send for schooled?
[101:41.72]Yeah, no.
[101:42.56]So my dog, you don't?
[101:44.42]Well, you guys send these really cute teddy bears, but my dog just ate his face.
[101:50.60]Cool.
[101:53.44]Will you send her a new one, Miss?
[101:56.08]You asked me to send you a new one?
[101:57.16]I'll send you next time we do schooled.
[101:59.49]Okay.
[102:00.03]He has no Nulls right now.
[102:02.62]I did almost rage quit accidentally.
[102:04.10]That would have been bad.
[102:06.62]Charlie, that was not needed.
[102:08.64]No, I'm sorry.
[102:11.18]My eyes were red.
[102:12.32]I was just full of rage.
[102:14.36]I'm sorry.
[102:14.88]I knew one impression and it just happened.
[102:16.58]That was so unneeded.
[102:17.50]Rage quit at the ninth race.
[102:19.40]I think it was actually me that hit you, Miz.
[102:21.32]No, it was Charlie.
[102:22.91]I literally saw Charlie rammed me at the star and I... I hit you with fireballs on my screen.
[102:28.86]No.
[102:29.12]He... I do not deserve that at all.
[102:31.20]He saw me.
[102:33.20]Yeah.
[102:33.40]You're a good man.
[102:34.22]Don't take it personally.
[102:35.29]That wasn't the real Charlie.
[102:36.97]I would never do that.
[102:38.33]Okay.
[102:38.71]Oh, wait.
[102:38.89]There's my map.
[102:40.29]Okay.
[102:40.51]Let's do it.
[102:40.89]Let's go.
[102:41.23]Come on.
[102:41.85]Alright.
[102:42.31]This is the one.
[102:43.49]I'm going to get top four in this one.
[102:44.59]I have to.
[102:45.53]I have to.
[102:45.91]I got screwed right there.
[102:56.71]It's alright.
[102:59.92]I drove into a fucking tree.
[103:01.56]I DROVE INTO A TREE!
[103:23.89]OH!
[103:26.67]Oh, you gotta drift.
[103:27.81]OH!
[103:33.66]Whoever's in first, I'm so sorry.
[103:35.40]You're dead.
[103:43.39]No, don't!
[104:16.52]Oh, Jesus!
[104:17.70]I gotta hit somebody in the air.
[104:34.14]No!
[104:34.76]Come on!
[104:35.50]Right when I got the star off!
[104:37.64]Give me a fucking break!
[104:51.09]I need a fucking Christmas miracle right now if I want to stay in this.
[105:08.07]Oh, I'm so angry.
[105:12.05]I was in third place.
[105:28.87]Choke?
[105:28.99]What do you mean choke?
[105:30.31]I'm gonna get in 11th place!
[105:32.93]What happened?
[105:36.47]Who was just in 11th place?
[105:37.74]I also made you, and you made me.
[105:39.90]Dude, if I didn't... You made me.
[105:45.12]I got 12th twice.
[105:47.38]Fuck.
[105:48.68]Alright.
[105:50.16]You guys are tied for first.
[105:50.96]Two races left.
[105:51.62]MooMoo Meadows or die.
[105:53.74]I swear, do it.
[105:54.44]Holy fuck.
[105:55.36]We've gotten so far.
[105:56.16]Maybe three races.
[105:57.00]Past few races and still managed to get like fourth or fifth.
[106:05.31]I'm trying my hard out.
[106:06.25]You guys are just absurdly good.
[106:08.07]I can't not get last place.
[106:11.41]I feel you.
[106:12.15]Who's battling for that 11th spot right now?
[106:15.24]Well, I'm in 11.
[106:16.32]It's a solid 11.
[106:18.49]Dan, QT, and Simply are all fighting and no one else is close, really.
[106:22.05]Okay, next match, everyone please do Moo Moo Meadows.
[106:25.43]Fuck you.
[106:26.41]Sure.
[106:26.85]Alright, yeah, I get it.
[106:28.25]I do.
[106:30.43]Kano, let's make a 5, get the sub bet right here that I beat you.
[106:33.43]Okay.
[106:35.05]You already owe me, like, 70.
[106:39.89]In the hole.
[106:48.77]I don't think I've ever played this one.
[106:50.13]Have I?
[106:55.57]Oh, it's the airport one, right.
[107:04.34]Oh, don't go off the edge.
[107:13.96]Holy shit, I went... Why did I go so fast?
[107:23.17]Oh, there's a bomb.
[107:23.57]I'm going to fucking screw everybody over.
[107:24.81]I just killed like three people.
[107:31.22]I just did not... I freaked out.
[107:32.62]I can't play this game.
[107:34.16]I need to play Double Dash where I just am the one that throws the items and somebody else drives the car.
[108:08.15]I gotta hit these.
[108:08.93]Fuck!
[108:10.95]Get off two wheels, you fucking idiot!
[108:12.41]Get away from me!
[108:24.28]Get away from me!
[108:37.69]How do you take that turn with a fucking d- This is too hard for me.
[108:56.36]Come on, hit those things!
[109:02.26]I didn't even get a chance to fly!
[109:07.42]What are you doing?
[109:18.21]How does this keep happening?
[109:20.03]How does this keep happening?
[109:21.85]Connor, I'm going to share my one year anniversary, by the way.
[109:26.09]So there's a yo.
[109:27.41]So that's four subs I owe you now.
[109:29.51]Thank you.
[109:30.05]Well, it's more like 70.
[109:31.31]74, sorry.
[109:33.35]Play cheers to you.
[109:34.19]Okay.
[109:43.29]See if it helps.
[109:46.19]Well, Lindy, what place are you now?
[109:48.29]I'm getting fucked, okay?
[109:49.17]Are you guys targeting me on purpose?
[109:50.97]It really feels that way.
[109:52.55]Yes.
[109:54.77]It 100% feels that way.
[109:57.40]What you're about to hear.
[109:58.44]Jerm, I'm coming for your ass, bitch.
[109:59.98]What?
[110:00.26]Hey, why?
[110:01.00]What are you talking about?
[110:02.20]I don't care about 11th anymore.
[110:04.12]Why are you coming for me?
[110:05.14]What do I do?
[110:06.26]Well, you're one place ahead of me.
[110:07.44]You're going to kick the man while he's down?
[110:10.59]Down?
[110:10.89]You're ahead of me.
[110:13.73]Alright, let's go.
[110:14.71]Here we go.
[110:23.68]I don't fuck around with this one.
[110:25.30]What you're about to hear is encouragement and praise with cheering applause just for you.
[110:33.87]Acknowledging you for a variety of reasons.
[110:37.82]Oh fuck, I lost the other headphones.
[110:39.66]I don't need audio.
[110:42.44]My other headphone came out.
[110:44.16]I'm using two different headphones.
[110:49.07]So sit back.
[110:51.11]Get ready.
[110:53.57]Here it comes.
[111:01.20]We want to thank you for all your hard work.
[111:09.44]You're the one who steps up and gets things done around here.
[111:16.12]You keep your word, you deliver what you promise, and then you go the extra mile.
[111:26.12]You're doing a great job!
[111:28.53]A great job!
[111:36.90]If anyone asks, we'll tell them.
[111:40.38]A great job!
[111:59.30]This one's too hard.
[112:25.01]Where'd it go?
[112:25.45]Where's the fucking cheers?
[112:38.36]Get out of my fucking way!
[112:42.46]Yeah, it's impossible to be able to have cheers to you play when this is the second time you've probably played this map.
[112:47.31]And you don't play Mario Kart.
[112:50.73]Oh well.
[112:53.93]This is the last one, Mizkif.
[112:55.01]You do have a good chance for top four.
[112:57.69]Does third get anything?
[112:59.67]This is the actual last lap right now.
[113:01.75]Oh, it's top four.
[113:06.00]Who is fourth and how many points am I away?
[113:10.88]Why would you ever bet for me?
[113:12.50]I've come in seventh through last place every single game.
[113:16.51]I am not going to ever get past fourth.
[113:17.93]You know what I'm saying?
[113:20.33]That's just free money.
[113:22.29]One or two, yep.
[113:27.45]This is it.
[113:28.47]All right.
[113:28.75]Last one.
[113:29.15]Good luck, everyone.
[113:29.81]Good luck, guys.
[113:31.08]Good luck, everybody.
[113:32.04]Have fun.
[113:34.50]By the way, I'm going to drive the wrong way the whole game, by the way.
[113:38.54]Okay.
[113:40.18]Respectable.
[113:41.88]Wait.
[113:42.10]Don't do that.
[113:42.57]I don't know if it disconnects.
[113:43.61]It's going to be an agent of chaos.
[113:45.33]I'm just kidding.
[113:45.81]I'm not going to do it.
[113:46.93]Okay.
[113:47.49]I don't know if it disconnects.
[113:49.11]No, you'll be fine.
[113:50.81]Oh.
[114:00.10]Oh, my God.
[114:26.61]Oh, that shell is in such a bad spot.
[114:31.19]Oh my god, I can't believe this.
[114:33.73]I'll gift you a sub if you stop moving.
[114:35.23]You've got to stop throwing shells.
[114:36.81]Whoever's doing it, you've got to stop.
[114:38.47]I feel really bad on that one, whoever's Nate.
[114:41.42]Yeah, well.
[114:43.38]That's on me.
[114:44.32]I shouldn't have done that.
[114:46.52]My mother raised me better.
[114:47.68]I don't know why I did that.
[114:51.00]We should all destroy Connery's pants.
[114:53.73]Yeah, do it.
[114:58.62]Oh, fuck!
[114:59.16]I hit myself twice!
[115:03.71]Oh, I shouldn't have done that.
[115:06.63]Oh my god!
[115:07.65]Fucking cows.
[115:24.28]Awww.
[115:28.81]I'm to get lucky here.
[115:34.85]Fuck you, Brezzo.
[115:35.81]Come on, Connery, this man's dead.
[115:39.48]Whoever's Link, did you just swing a sword at me?
[115:42.46]Holy shit.
[115:46.98]Was it in the ground?
[115:47.80]Who was in first or second that just chucked a red shell at me?
[115:50.90]No, I didn't make it.
[115:52.42]No!
[115:53.94]Stop.
[115:55.29]Who was in first or second that just threw... Mizzy, you got fucked at the end.
[115:59.71]Wait, did you get hit by a red shell?
[116:01.49]Who was in second that threw a red shell?
[116:04.40]It was me.
[116:06.11]I threw it backwards, like, right after I finished.
[116:07.83]You are the reason Mizzy did not place top four.
[116:09.83]You know, I'm proud of first place.
[116:14.08]You literally just stopped me from getting top four.
[116:16.42]130 feels good.
[116:17.04]Feels real good.
[116:19.36]I'm happy with top four.
[116:20.86]Who's the final top four?
[116:22.26]I think it was Clint.
[116:26.84]Lint, Mango, me, and then Prezzo.
[116:29.28]Prezzo, yeah.
[116:30.67]Do the dream team.
[116:32.11]11th place.
[116:32.75]Who won that?
[116:33.69]Simply got it by two points.
[116:35.73]Oh, yes.
[116:37.15]Simply sniped 11th?
[116:40.05]It was a coincidence.
[116:42.59]All right.
[116:42.97]All right.
[116:45.09]No, it was.
[116:46.43]That was a lot of fun.
[116:47.98]I suck absolute asshole at this game.
[116:50.48]But that was a lot of fun.
[116:51.96]It was fun to play.
[116:53.22]That was fun.

[117:23.99]Dude, Mango's dirty at this game.
[117:25.35]I was not expecting that.
[117:26.35]I probably should, considering it's a Nintendo game.
[117:30.78]Oh, no.
[117:33.34]No.
[117:35.82]Okay, I'm angry.
[117:36.80]Hey, re-roll, though.
[117:37.59]Imagine.
[117:38.45]Who won?
[117:39.57]You won, Miz.
[117:40.87]What?
[117:41.94]I got nothing else for you.
[117:42.90]Thank you all for playing.
[117:44.28]Hope you guys had fun and shit
[118:06.40]Thank you for making this event happen.
[118:10.18]Thank you for organizing it.
[118:11.98]It was so much fun.
[118:12.78]Thank you a lot.
[118:14.26]Next week, we'll have to ban Clint and put him in the Hall of Fame.
[118:17.37]He's too goated.
[118:20.43]Charlie, you're dead to me.
[118:21.47]If you ever throw another shell in this town again, you're through.
[118:24.31]I already am going to fucking confessional about it.
[118:27.29]I feel bad.
[118:29.26]Our next event is a 16-man battleship tournament that me and Jerma are throwing on.
[118:33.44]That'll come sometime in the next couple weeks.
[118:36.70]Yeah, of course.
[118:37.99]Absolutely.
[118:39.81]German totally knows what you're talking about.
[118:41.41]Are you talking about a video game?
[118:45.87]Yeah, battleship the game.
[118:48.63]You mean like the one where you pick like B4 squares and stuff?
[118:52.97]Oh shit, that's fun.
[118:54.35]I used to play that when I was little.
[118:57.41]Do you not know about competitive battleship, Clint?
[118:59.47]No, I've never heard of this.
[119:01.49]And this is a real thing.
[119:02.85]I don't even know what competitive battleship is.
[119:04.96]That's unbelievable.
[119:06.12]Clint's not invited to this, right?
[119:07.46]Because he won?
[119:09.34]Why would I be excluded from the battleship thing?
[119:17.52]But anyway, boys, thank you so much.
[119:18.88]That's all I got.
[119:20.60]Have a good rest of your days and shit.
[119:23.46]Take it easy, guys.
[119:26.12]Bye.
[119:28.34]Nice to meet you.
[119:29.92]Meet a lot of you for the first time.
[119:31.55]Nice to meet you, Clint.
[119:34.71]Connor, it was nice to meet you, man.
[119:36.51]Hey, thanks, man.
[119:38.27]Big Moist, it was a pleasure, man.
[119:39.61]Nice to meet you.
[119:40.71]Nice to meet you as well, Miz.
[119:42.69]Hey, Miz, I'll be at that mod meeting.
[119:44.37]I'll be at the mod meeting at 11, right?
[119:47.48]Yeah, 45 minutes, German, be there, okay?
[119:49.22]Okay, yep.
[119:50.58]Alright, bye, guys.
[119:51.94]Bye-bye.
[119:54.32]Well, there it is.
[119:56.18]That was the... I must say, I didn't realize I was going to get smoked that bad.
[120:04.98]But that was still a lot of fun.
[120:07.18]Sorry for the... I don't know why the stream was so fucked up.
[120:11.29]I think it was good because we were pulling perspectives into Ludwig's stream, so... But...
[120:17.08]Yeah, if you came here thinking you were going to get good Mario Kart gameplay, I have to apologize.
[120:21.12]I did not make that clear.
[120:24.08]Um... Fuck.
[120:26.92]I really thought I was going to do really good.
[120:29.02]I... Man, I'm in my own little world where me coming in first place at like 50cc is like really good.
[120:41.93]When I saw 150cc, I was like, oh!
[120:47.35]That sounds fun.
[120:47.91]I like play on 50 or 100.
[120:53.29]It was a lot of fun though.
[120:54.59]Look, this is just for fun.
[121:00.22]Live on a Tuesday.
[121:00.90]Well, just because this is just a fun thing.
[121:03.48]Ludwig was just like, you want to do it?
[121:04.66]And I'm like, yeah, sure.
[121:05.80]Why not?
[121:06.02]It sounds like fun.
[121:07.62]And oh yeah, best 16 person battleship meta Twitch tournament.
[121:13.61]Let's go.
[121:14.35]Let's go.
[121:18.82]That sounds like a perfect thing to do.
[121:21.02]We'll work on that.
[121:22.36]The next stream is going to be on... We're going to do Tuesday again.
[121:26.52]I have some stuff I got to do this weekend.
[121:28.68]Actually, I have a lot of things going on this weekend.
[121:30.40]So we're going to do Tuesday of next week, exactly one week from right now.
[121:34.92]And then after that, we're going to go back to normal.
[121:36.48]We'll just go back to normal with Sunday, Saturday and Sunday.
[121:40.16]Uh, yeah, we've been doing a lot of, um, kind of co-op streams, right?
[121:45.46]The last, like, three or four streams in a row.
[121:46.87]Uh, we're gonna go back to some solo stuff for a little while.
[121:50.35]But, it's, it was a pleasure to even be invited to something like this.
[121:54.49]It's a lot of fun.
[121:55.27]Um, it was cool.
[121:56.87]Networking Andy, right?
[121:59.79]I hope it was at least somewhat enjoyable.
[122:01.48]You could, there was a lot of other perspectives to watch if you wanted to watch somebody not get their ass kicked, but it's all right.
[122:07.76]And that's going to be it.
[122:08.88]I'm going to close it out here.
[122:13.89]I'll see you guys on Tuesday of next week.
[122:17.65]Have a good rest of your night.
[122:19.43]Let's get the subs in.
[122:20.65]Let's do it here.
[122:25.12]And here they go.
[122:26.48]What time?
[122:28.82]Like 2 p.m.
[122:29.54]Pacific on this coming next Tuesday.
[122:37.12]And hopefully in the next couple of weeks, the next like two or three weeks, I will have a lot more stuff to share with you guys.
[122:42.42]Because I did mention this a few times.
[122:44.87]In August and September are two monster streams.
[122:50.11]I mean like monster streams.
