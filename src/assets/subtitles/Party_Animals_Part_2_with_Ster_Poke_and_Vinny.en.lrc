[00:22.15]What's going on?
[00:24.31]What's happening everybody?
[00:28.43]Currently just setting up.
[00:29.61]We got hoops.
[00:32.38]Got a few gamers in the call coming up here.
[00:38.36]Vinny, Pinesauce, Ster, and Poke.
[00:45.85]Those are the three powerful entities
[00:50.68]We'll be playing Party Animals today.
[00:59.86]That was an avatar intro.
[01:02.57]The three gamers.
[01:07.23]I love this game so.
[01:09.17]And actually experience it the way it was supposed to be experienced with friends.
[01:13.85]I played with Holly a little.
[01:17.11]But not the four person, full party experience.
[01:21.50]Currently lying down in my new setup.
[01:25.18]Still about, last time it was like 80%.
[01:27.68]Now it's like 90, 92%.

[03:01.77]Just waiting for Str... Neat Str's, uh, attendance for Spren code, or either one.
[03:13.63]I think Str was doing something and he might be changing over, maybe taking a break.
[03:18.22]You can chill, it's all good.
[03:25.44]This is great, but still waiting for sorcery.
[03:29.14]He'll get it.
[03:29.56]He'll get it.
[03:30.14]You should open crates.
[03:34.45]No.
[03:36.53]I'm not going to open crates.
[03:38.53]I mean, we might actually do that because this is Party Animals.
[03:42.57]Party Animals has random opening boxes kind of thing, doesn't it?

[04:46.39]Did they just switch around all the buttons as a joke?
[04:51.46]Oh, I see.
[04:51.88]Because Y is jump.
[04:53.34]I see what you mean.
[04:54.54]Y is jump and select is the menu.
[04:56.84]Start does nothing.

[05:41.86]Yo.
[05:42.18]What's up, Poke?
[05:44.25]What up?
[05:46.23]Poke, you may be a little low on volume-wise.
[05:48.89]I guess I could always boost you if I need to.
[05:52.17]We're looking for a boost.
[05:56.10]Let me see.
[05:57.74]We're about to be, like, at a nice dinner party.
[05:59.52]Or, like, a lounge singer is going to come out.
[06:03.00]Am I allowed to run to the bathroom?
[06:05.16]Yeah.
[06:06.28]No.
[06:06.68]Oh, yes.
[06:07.34]Oh, shit.
[06:07.74]Wait, should we vote on it?
[06:10.28]I don't think so.
[06:11.32]Okay, so there's a no.
[06:12.72]Vinny, what's your vote?
[06:14.62]I was not sure at first, but I think let the man use the bathroom is my vote.
[06:19.74]Okay, well, my vote is the comedy one, which could be no to keep you here.
[06:23.23]But I'm going to say yes.
[06:28.07]He will complain about that in 30 minutes.
[06:30.99]I think he already left.
[06:32.25]He didn't even wait for the vote.
[06:35.17]He just left.
[06:37.70]I love democracy.
[06:39.22]Are you Frosty Flakes?
[06:41.58]Yeah, that's me.
[06:43.44]Did you pick that name?
[06:44.74]Yeah.
[06:46.04]Okay.
[06:46.84]I don't know.
[06:47.16]I'm partial to Gas Can, but Frosty Flakes is pretty good too.
[06:51.88]Well, Frosted Flakes couldn't fit, so I had to just make it Frosty Flakes.
[06:58.25]I had to improvise a little.
[07:02.56]Have you guys played this?
[07:04.71]A little bit.
[07:06.89]No.
[07:08.19]I didn't even do the tutorial because
[07:11.49]I was scrambling to get everything ready.
[07:13.59]It's very fun.
[07:15.25]Is it like... What's that game with the eggheads?
[07:19.25]And you're just punching other eggheads?
[07:21.37]What is that game?
[07:22.71]Fall Guys.
[07:24.21]I actually like this better than Fall Guys.
[07:26.09]Just because, I don't know.
[07:27.66]I never got a crown in Fall Guys, so I fucking don't like that game.
[07:30.80]Yeah.
[07:31.82]How about Gang Beasts?
[07:33.28]Is it like that?
[07:33.96]Yes.
[07:34.50]I would say that's a better comparison.
[07:38.08]Okay.
[07:38.60]Okay, Ster, I am about to invite you if you can hear me.
[07:43.63]And then Polka, I'm gonna bring you into the lobby.

[07:49.83]Just Polka.
[07:52.52]Polka, P-O-L-K-A?
[07:54.56]You're the first to ever say Polka.
[07:56.48]You don't want to say Polka.
[07:57.26]You just didn't want to say Pokey, right?
[07:58.72]Like, I get it.
[07:59.32]Polka.
[08:01.79]The Polka King of Chicago.

[14:14.85]That gorilla just hit that thing so hard.
[14:16.65]Gorilla down.
[14:21.73]Don't let them get in here.
[14:22.79]Don't let them get in.
[14:23.38]We can have two defenders.
[14:24.18]If there were two goalies in soccer, don't you think it would be much harder to score?
[14:28.76]Oh my god.
[14:43.03]Alright.
[14:50.17]Bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo.
[14:52.77]Oh my god.

[15:12.53]Yeah, I mean, you guys gotta go on the offense.
[15:14.47]They're trying to knock me out.
[15:16.90]I'm going after the cat.
[15:18.38]I'm grabbing the alligator.
[15:19.08]Oh, I'm dead.
[15:19.86]I'm down.
[15:20.60]Goalie down.
[15:21.68]This could be a new competitive sport.
[15:23.56]And Rocket League move away.
[15:24.82]This is the new one.
[15:30.10]Really, Drew?
[15:33.52]That was on purpose.
[15:34.34]That was on purpose if anybody was watching.
[15:36.52]I didn't mean to.
[15:38.48]Is this what hockey looked like?
[15:39.72]Dude, they're murdering me.
[15:43.92]You got to go over to murder.
[15:45.02]Alright, jump and kick.
[15:47.74]It's an insane move.
[15:49.02]You have to use it a lot more.
[15:51.18]What buttons kick the on the Y and then a you'll do a big jumping kick and it is devastating.
[16:00.19]Good, good.
[16:00.75]Alright, come on, come on, come on.
[16:01.73]We need to score here.
[16:02.23]We need to score.
[16:03.27]Come on, guys.
[16:03.83]We need to score.
[16:05.27]I'm out of the goal.
[16:05.99]Bounced off my body.
[16:08.05]Get it.
[16:08.97]I'm on the ground.
[16:09.67]I can't jump up.
[16:15.16]Oh, I am ragdolling so hard.
[16:16.62]We got this.
[16:19.56]Get off me.
[16:22.11]Is there a timer on this map at all?
[16:23.55]I was going to say, there's no timer.
[16:24.79]We're just going to be here forever.
[16:26.19]This is the whole stream.
[16:27.17]I actually don't like the... Hold on, don't talk.
[16:31.09]I killed him.
[16:31.93]He's dead.
[16:32.83]Wait, no, I'm dead.
[16:33.51]Alright, I got him off you.
[16:35.67]I thought I killed someone.
[16:37.89]I'm on poke.
[16:38.40]I see.
[16:38.86]Somebody hit it.
[16:44.11]If you press, if you run in circle, you could like roll.
[16:47.60]Go faster.
[16:49.18]You can tell when I'm really fucking just punching.
[16:52.76]Trying to punch this cat in the back of the head.
[16:54.42]Okay, we're good.
[16:59.22]You guys are gonna get fucking destroyed.
[17:01.28]We are only down by one goal.
[17:05.28]Oh, by the way, the top left yellow bar is your stamina.
[17:07.54]It does deplete, and when it does deplete, you are fucked.
[17:11.88]I'm being grabbed.
[17:13.40]Grab.
[17:14.05]Grab.
[17:18.01]Get up, Duck.

[18:00.26]Here, you defend.
[18:00.98]Whoever's the worst, defend.
[18:03.03]I'm knocked out.
[18:06.81]Actually, maybe whoever's the best.
[18:09.39]I can do it.
[18:10.33]I'll try.
[18:10.83]How do you grab the thing?
[18:12.41]Oh, got it.
[18:12.85]Okay.

[19:37.09]Oh, it's close.
[19:37.97]It's close.
[19:42.18]If that bounces off the wall, there's an opportunity.
[19:45.06]Nine seconds.
[19:48.61]Oh, I just gotta bounce it.
[19:53.39]Yeah, well, it was a nice attempt.
[19:55.73]It's fine.

[21:03.87]Every like minute or two, it does a gigantic like gale storm.
[21:10.89]Okay.
[21:11.45]And it'll take you.
[21:12.39]So be careful.
[21:13.86]This is like Squid Games, but without the prize money.
[21:18.73]And with cool skins and stuff.
[21:22.35]So shut up.
[21:26.53]You forgot to add that part, which is like, what are you talking about?
[21:30.17]This is like extensive Mario Party.
[21:32.39]Alright.
[21:32.61]What teams are we on?
[21:33.59]I think we're going to be on teams of two now.
[21:34.96]I think it's random.
[21:38.50]Do we have a choice?
[21:39.82]It's going to take the four of us and just kind of randomize it.
[21:43.28]Okay.
[21:44.96]I can't wait to talk about this back to you guys.
[21:47.76]I can't believe that you booted up Party Animals, came in a recliner with your like fist up, like you're ready to just start punching people like you're ready to.
[21:56.72]It's all of us.
[21:58.40]What do we do?
[21:58.80]It's all of us.
[22:00.06]Watch out for that bomb.
[22:00.76]Watch out for that bomb.
[22:01.94]Survive.

[22:10.76]OK, we did it.
[22:12.15]That was bad.
[22:12.81]I had an opportunity.
[22:13.89]No, no, no, no, no.
[22:23.55]Folk, it's just you versus four people.
[22:25.83]I think I'm still alive somehow.
[22:30.05]Folk, if you pull this off.
[22:31.17]No, I'm dead.
[22:34.59]Okay.
[22:36.75]We're all on the same team.
[22:37.89]That's why we all lost.
[22:39.41]Alright.
[22:40.19]But you will get it.
[22:41.49]We'll get it.
[22:41.89]This is the one.

[22:57.36]We should gang up on the same guy.
[22:58.28]Get the guy with the shovel.
[22:58.96]Get the guy with the shovel.
[22:59.55]Yeah, you hold Y while you're holding right trigger.

[31:59.68]You have to grab it with two hands.
[32:01.90]It's got to be right in front of you.
[32:02.96]You got to get right up in there.
[32:06.85]I'm dropping a bomb right in the middle.
[32:12.05]Why?
[32:12.61]You can utilize it if you want to.

[34:28.42]Oh, let's all get in the frame.
[34:34.14]There we go.
[34:41.73]You just poopster and get out.
[34:45.52]We gotta go back to that.
[34:46.74]Every time I bring that up, everyone's like, wait a second, you don't like prolong your bathroom time by like an hour?
[34:53.19]Warm up around four.
[34:54.01]Okay, an hour is crazy.
[34:55.25]Who's sitting there for an hour?
[34:56.15]Not an hour, but still.
[34:58.15]All my best ideas happen in the bathroom.
[35:00.43]Like, seriously, why not just like stay there ten minutes and see what happens?
[35:04.89]Hey, don't act like you know me if you ain't ever had the fucking toilet line on the back of your thighs.
[35:11.73]Don't even.
[35:12.07]What?
[35:13.69]yeah do your legs not go numb when you use the bathroom Ster oh into the game that one's fun the right one wait my legs go numb do they no again when I'm in the bathroom I what if you don't have to though if you're drinking pee pee you're drinking espresso on the toilet interesting you're just trying to spend as much time in there as possible
[35:41.28]I said best ideas happen there's good reverb so you know you can do a lot with that reverb no wait go for a walk 30 minutes is the time in nature okay we have to play the game but hey gamers listen up true story yeah no no you listen up isn't the bathroom the worst room in a house
[36:04.06]If you were to spend the most of your time like, oh, I'm going to sit and think.
[36:07.38]You choose the bathroom.
[36:08.44]Protect me.
[36:09.08]Protect me and beat him up on his machine.
[36:12.98]I'm just collecting a ton of stuff right now.
[36:14.84]This is great.
[36:16.34]Oh.
[36:18.54]I don't understand what's happening, but I'm going to just.
[36:21.88]Play their game.
[36:22.52]Yeah.
[36:22.68]So our arcade machine, if you go up to it and hold a grab on it, you will get into the game eventually and have to collect coins.
[36:28.66]Then you have to make sure you protect me on the machine right now.
[36:33.74]Try it.
[36:35.40]We're in the lead.
[36:39.90]Help me.
[36:40.98]Somebody help, please.
[36:43.28]That was big.
[36:46.46]I got two diamonds.
[36:49.51]Oh, yeah.
[36:50.13]We're going to win for sure.
[36:51.01]I love fake video games in video games.
[36:53.17]It's my favorite.
[36:57.11]Ben, how do you get the shield?
[37:00.05]Vinny, protect me.
[37:02.72]You get the shield.
[37:03.30]You get it for, I think, five seconds when you initially get onto the arcade machine.
[37:08.13]So it would be almost impossible if we did it the other way.
[37:12.93]They can get on our machine and walk us into bombs and stuff, so...
[37:17.61]We're up in the lead by a lot.
[37:19.99]I can't hit anyone.
[37:21.15]Get on the machine.
[37:21.69]Sir, get on the machine.
[37:23.17]No, you.
[37:23.95]Okay, okay.
[37:24.83]Sir, use a jump hit.
[37:26.53]I know.
[37:26.89]I miss and I hit my teammates.
[37:29.75]We're going to win right now as long as I stay alive for 10 seconds.
[37:33.40]Oh, I got it.
[37:37.76]I got them all.
[37:39.27]nice dude proud of you it's a good thing we have a retro dad on our team who really knows the classics yeah oops anyone else Mario brother oh I tried to help
[38:10.22]Good.
[38:12.08]Incoming victory in three, two, one.
[38:16.02]Yeah, there we go, there we go.
[38:21.95]Easy.
[38:22.23]I remember back in my day when Super Mario could only go to the right.
[38:28.39]Did anybody else Mario Brother?
[38:29.91]We actually won one.
[38:31.21]By Mario Brother?
[38:32.21]Hey, oh, so, sir, have you ever heard of Lindsey Buckingham?
[38:34.66]Do you know who that is?
[38:35.54]Lindsey Buckingham?
[38:36.88]No.
[38:38.06]Okay, he was in Fleetwood Mech.
[38:40.44]Never heard of that.
[38:41.62]Okay.
[38:42.78]Wait, what?
[38:44.36]Fleetwood Mech?
[38:46.07]You've never heard of Fleetwood Mech?
[38:47.53]Oh, man.
[38:48.53]Is that one of the arena battles in Armored Corps?
[38:51.31]Yes.
[38:52.01]Okay, so now that you know, he basically, what he did was he rebuilt his bathroom in the studio so he could get that reverb for some of the songs on their 19-something, 70-something album Tusk.
[39:03.11]What?
[39:03.57]So if he wasn't in the bathroom longer than a couple minutes to poop, he would have never thought to rebuild his bathroom in the recording studio.
[39:11.66]That's true, by the way.
[39:12.82]Did they do grunge?
[39:14.06]Football, let's go.
[39:15.70]No, they didn't do grunge.
[39:16.48]No, they don't do grunge.
[39:19.32]I feel like that's where you would do it.
[39:25.11]Also, Armored Core Arena Battles.
[39:26.81]I just did all those last night.
[39:28.17]I got the S rank.
[39:29.39]I'm like a god gamer now, I think.
[39:32.61]what game Armored Core six oh oh Ster you said if I beat the pre-patch helicopter boss like the third or fourth boss you'd give me a thousand dollars so I just I don't want to bring it up in front of all these people but did you do it Jerm I oh yeah I did yeah nice see everybody thinks I was doing that like oh man you don't have to beat this no I was doing it specifically to make sure he had to pay me
[39:59.92]It had nothing to do with why I understand is that you played Armored Core once a month ago.
[40:04.28]No, I played it twice actually a month ago.
[40:12.21]Alright, this just plays just like football.
[40:14.21]You gotta run it past the goal line.
[40:18.77]Am I going the right way?
[40:19.39]Yep, yep, yep.
[40:20.47]Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[40:21.40]Toss it.
[40:22.00]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[40:59.07]Travis Payton.
[40:59.77]Payton Payton.
[41:00.59]Alright, Ster, if you can name me one New England Patriot that's played in the last three years, I'll give you $1,000.
[41:08.36]What's his name?
[41:10.98]Payton Montana.
[41:12.25]Payton Montana.
[41:14.50]Oh, wait, I'm not Ster.
[41:15.40]Sorry, I thought I was Ster.
[41:17.62]In the last three years, somebody that has played on the New England Patriots, and I will give you $1,000 USD.
[41:22.47]Oh, Tom Brady.
[41:24.83]That's incorrect.
[41:25.49]Was that three years?
[41:26.23]I appreciate you trying, but no.
[41:28.59]Then it was either Buscemi.
[41:32.21]Steve Buscemi.
[41:33.33]Steve Buscemi.
[41:34.02]Hobson Dugnutt.
[41:40.08]This is so backwards.
[41:41.12]Don't you go to school so that you can know the answers to real questions instead of who was on a football team?
[41:46.47]True.
[41:47.13]Now, like in my adult life, it's like $1,000 if you know a sports person.
[41:50.99]Hey, you were going to give me $1,000 to fight up a pixel helicopter.
[41:54.81]I'm sorry, Vinesauce.
[41:56.31]Vinesauce, what do you want me to call you, bro?
[41:58.07]Vinesauce?
[41:58.59]Vinny.
[41:59.49]Vinny.
[42:00.21]Okay.
[42:00.47]Yeah.
[42:01.86]Vinny.
[42:02.16]Hi, Poke.
[42:03.58]Would you want me to call you Poke?
[42:05.02]Yeah.
[42:05.50]Yeah.
[42:06.10]Alright.
[42:07.12]Get it in there!
[42:07.96]Yes!
[42:09.12]Nice job.
[42:18.53]You know what, though?
[42:19.03]I do kind of like the way you say vine souse.
[42:21.59]Vine souse.
[42:23.03]Vine souse.
[42:24.94]I got like a little bit.
[42:28.24]I got the stickers, some stickers made, and it came with like mule sauce.
[42:32.78]No, I'm not kidding.
[42:33.56]I got stickers made, and it comes with free hot sauce, and it's called like donkey sauce.
[42:37.90]Let me throw that down here.
[42:40.52]Oh.
[42:40.62]Alright, Sterl.
[42:43.67]How many yards is it for a first down by default in the NFL?
[42:51.05]20?
[42:51.59]I was going to offer you $10,000 because I was so confident, but I was like, oh shit.
[42:55.93]But wait, what if he knows this?
[42:58.19]Is it 20?
[42:58.53]No.
[42:58.67]I mean, you could lie.
[43:00.75]15?
[43:02.11]No.
[43:05.41]40?
[43:05.43]10.
[43:06.21]10?
[43:06.23]40?
[43:06.25]40 yards for a first down?
[43:11.15]They're paying people like $20 million a year to walk 10 yards at a time.
[43:17.75]That's all they have to do?
[43:21.47]Well, you have a bunch of other people trying to prevent you from walking or running 10 yards.
[43:26.69]Yeah, but if you prevent them too hard, they go, they blow the whistle and they make a real loud noise.
[43:32.51]They say, you prevented him in the wrong way.
[43:35.89]Oh, my God.
[43:36.47]They're doing it.
[43:38.35]Can we get it together here?
[43:40.73]I've never watched baseball.
[43:41.72]I don't know what's going on.
[43:42.86]These guys are as good as Steve Buscemi.
[43:44.86]Hulk, what's a home run?
[43:45.56]It's when you run it all the way through.
[43:52.96]Run it all the way through.
[43:54.42]You hit the ball so high that you could do a home run.
[43:56.44]You hit the ball so hard that they give you a free point because you were too good at the game.
[44:01.68]Is that what it is?
[44:02.54]Yeah.
[44:05.40]Alright.
[44:05.92]I hate to say this, but I've been to Yankee Stadium many times in my life.
[44:10.41]Sorry.
[44:10.73]Really?
[44:11.95]Yeah.
[44:14.25]It was indoctrinated by my father.
[44:16.37]Yankee Stadium?
[44:18.11]Yeah, back in the old one.
[44:19.31]The old one.
[44:19.85]The classic one.
[44:21.81]Actually, you're bringing back some memories.
[44:25.58]uh I I went to one baseball game in yankee stadium we sat there for like two hours got a little throwing I got a 15 hot dog and then they canceled the game that's pretty sick that's a like it's out of that that's a sad memory you're not in New York are you sir dodge roll uh I was in New Jersey so like you know
[44:49.50]uh bro sprinting and hitting b is a dodge roll it makes you go faster yeah it uses a lot of stamina though I saved you poke thank you man you guys ever go to a monster truck show that sounds cool I went to one of the derbies where all the cars just crashed into each other and they go yeah alright
[45:11.17]I went to one monster truck show before.
[45:12.75]Did you like it?
[45:16.00]It was alright.
[45:16.58]It was like the one famous guy, Grave Ripper, I think it was called.
[45:21.42]Some one famous... Grave Digger?
[45:23.44]Grave Digger, I think.
[45:24.54]Which way am I going, guys?
[45:25.48]Which way am I going?
[45:26.10]That way, that way.
[45:28.00]Wait, is that the one that it was like, Yeah, I'll bring your kids someday when Grave Digger will run over 50 cars.
[45:35.93]Yeah, I've been to one of those.
[45:37.51]Oh, actually, I've never been to one of those.
[45:42.53]It's only five bucks.
[45:45.31]It's something like that, right?
[45:46.07]Hey, you could get it for only five bucks.
[45:52.42]You ever see those ads?
[45:53.66]You see it on your TV anyways.

[45:59.44]Oh, I remember that.
[46:00.08]I remember that.
[46:03.54]Why would I do that?
[46:04.32]Oh, that was bad.
[46:05.66]That was not the throw button.
[46:07.18]I think I should be the quarterback of the team because I'm the one that's like full knowledge.
[46:10.22]I hate baseball.
[46:10.99]Baseball sucks.
[46:11.93]What is a quarterback?
[46:13.19]I think I should be the leader of the team because I know some things about sports and baseball and stuff.
[46:18.35]Can we vote?
[46:20.01]Do you think I should be the leader of the team?
[46:21.71]Everyone say yes.
[46:22.35]You're the leader.
[46:22.95]You're the leader.
[46:24.33]Quarterback?
[46:24.93]Nickelback?
[46:25.87]Oh.
[46:26.09]We have one vote for me to be.

[46:57.66]Donkey punch.
[46:59.02]Oh.
[47:00.16]Ster just doesn't like sports.
[47:02.20]That's why we lost this one.

[49:43.73]Poke, I got a fish incoming or bomb.
[49:45.83]What would you prefer?

[50:52.36]That was awesome.
[50:55.80]This game controls... Controversial opinion, this game controls like Pizza Tower.
[51:01.40]What?
[51:01.92]Don't star him on Pizza Tower.
[51:04.12]He is a hater.
[51:05.80]You don't like Pizza Tower?
[51:07.30]Oh god.
[51:07.86]I'm sorry, Star.
[51:08.48]You have to fight like a thousand million people now.
[51:10.65]No, I'm fine with that.
[51:12.07]Whatever you feel is best for you.
[51:13.19]Oh, I'm sorry.
[51:14.35]You don't like New Jersey.
[51:15.51]What do you like, Star?
[51:16.37]What do you like about New Jersey?
[51:21.56]I like Wildwood.
[51:25.09]Oh, that was almost amazing, Poke.
[51:27.27]You were so close.
[51:28.49]Thank you.
[51:28.83]I like Wildwood.
[51:29.81]Who doesn't like Wildwood?
[51:31.43]Somebody said, Ster has no good takes.
[51:34.89]Like, none.
[51:37.00]Sometimes... Oh, Poke, that's it.
[51:41.72]That's it.
[51:46.98]Oh, wow.

[51:59.15]Oh, god damn it, Poke.
[52:00.29]I just hit the MVP.
[52:01.23]That was my fault.
[52:03.25]Why?
[52:05.17]Just knock the shark out.
[52:09.86]Once you fall, you just die.
[52:12.16]It's hard to get back on.
[52:15.11]I could feel how hard you just pressed the button when you just did that.
[52:20.56]Big bomb coming in.
[52:21.36]I punched him.
[52:22.88]I'm making sure this guy doesn't get in.
[52:28.36]I'm throwing a big bomb in there.
[52:31.75]Big bomb coming in.
[52:33.35]Oh, what unbelievable placement.
[52:35.05]That's actually unbelievable.
[52:38.47]Oh, my God.
[52:38.99]Come on.
[52:43.85]Alright, we can do this.
[52:45.29]Everybody just play smart.
[52:52.69]I'm instantly dead.
[52:56.40]I got penguin down.
[53:04.62]What is... There's elementalists.
[53:08.66]It's a gun.
[53:09.26]It's a gun.
[53:09.72]You said that you asked about guns.
[53:10.70]There are guns in the game.
[53:13.65]Here comes a bomb.
[53:16.49]How am I still frozen?
[53:17.39]Alright.
[53:22.29]I got the gorilla.
[53:23.73]I don't know if he's going to lose or not, but he's down there.
[53:28.08]This is going to get ugly.
[53:29.48]Someone needs to kill the shark.
[53:38.94]Boys, boys, I think that's it.
[53:41.98]I just shot the shark with a fish and that... Yo.
[53:45.50]Just don't die.
[53:46.24]Just don't die.
[53:47.36]Chat, did you see that?
[53:48.35]That's a win right there, fellas.
[53:52.31]That was amazing.
[53:53.03]I sniped him.
[53:53.87]He was about to grab onto the bridge and he grabbed onto a fish and died.
[53:58.17]Wait, why did we draw?
[54:00.37]We just won that game.
[54:01.39]Wait, draw.
[54:03.86]I was still standing.
[54:06.44]Well, I guess we all win.
[54:07.90]Weird.
[54:08.16]Okay.
[54:11.34]It's a good picture.
[54:13.98]I think it counts as a win.
[54:16.61]Vinny, sing the Fortnite victory song.
[54:19.53]What's the Fortnite victory?
[54:20.97]What do you mean?
[54:23.62]Are we playing any Roblox today?
[54:24.82]No, Roblox was Roblox.
[54:30.75]I don't think I can do Roblox today because I'm not really set for it.
[54:34.45]I'm kidding.
[54:34.85]Yeah, I'm sick.
[54:36.13]I'm sick.
[54:36.57]I can't.
[54:37.81]I've never played Roblox.
[54:39.50]I've never played it in my life.
[54:40.84]Is that okay?
[54:41.98]Yeah, you should play one day.
[54:44.62]Is that for real?
[54:46.16]You want to play it one day?
[54:47.71]Yeah.
[54:48.23]It's awesome, Vinny.
[54:49.51]You would like it.
[54:51.50]It's just one of those things where it doesn't fucking matter.
[54:54.86]You can jump into a game and be like, I don't care about any of this and be out of it in 20 minutes and be like, I got what I wanted from that.
[55:01.77]That was fucking brilliant.
[55:03.93]What if I don't like the people who made it?
[55:07.99]They're kids.
[55:09.55]Oh, okay.
[55:11.03]That makes it so much worse when you put it like that.
[55:13.84]They're usually small children.
[55:19.30]They're kids.
[55:23.24]just for everybody to know I am changing to the goose they launched the roblox dating app that wait wait wait wait wait in light of the information that you have just revealed that does not check out yeah apparently it's like a dating thing though is that true first I've heard about I don't know I'm gonna Google it while we're talking I'm gonna log in roblox dating app I'm just gonna curse my search results but not in a creepy way that that may have implied why would they do that

[55:52.70]Like, why are they doing that?
[55:55.83]Oh my god, already?
[55:57.43]Cocomelon.
[56:02.07]This one is intense, because you can freeze in the water.
[56:06.70]And it breaks apart too.
[56:08.32]I would love it if one of my teammates could help, because I'm dying over here.
[56:13.56]I would love it if my bunny went up.
[56:38.18]Be careful.
[56:38.64]That thing is actually deadly.
[56:40.28]I got you.
[56:43.22]This thing I think is amazing.
[56:44.96]You shot that guy in the head.
[56:50.08]Watch where you're swinging that thing.
[56:51.30]Sorry, sir.
[56:53.42]I'm sorry.

[57:14.26]Alright, we're okay.
[57:17.20]He's gonna get me.
[57:17.72]He's gonna get me.
[57:18.60]I've got a bomb.
[57:20.82]Bomb is gonna be dropped right in the middle.
[57:25.10]Careful of the split.
[57:25.94]Bomb is in the middle.
[57:28.32]Oh, no, no.
[57:29.64]Placement is not good.
[57:30.88]I saved you, sir.
[57:33.10]Alright, guys.
[57:33.82]Yeah, there you go.
[57:34.52]It's 3v1.
[57:34.68]You guys got this.

[57:57.88]There we go.
[57:58.34]What was that?
[58:01.84]Why are we still... Oh, okay.
[58:02.97]They threw stuff at me.
[58:06.01]Alright.
[58:06.51]Alright, we got an advantage now.
[58:08.55]I'm feeling good.
[58:12.03]Whoa.
[58:12.75]Oh, no.
[58:14.01]No!
[58:15.75]No!
[58:17.49]You can come back.
[58:18.85]You can come back from this, buddy.
[58:21.03]Oh, man.
[58:21.52]It's all four.
[58:22.96]My glasses came off.
[58:29.86]Alright, be careful with that bomb.
[58:31.45]That thing is lit.
[58:34.09]And... Oh, good.
[58:37.29]Wonderful placement.
[58:38.13]We're just going to throw this.
[58:39.73]Oops.
[58:45.44]Okay.
[58:47.00]What am I still doing dead?
[59:02.17]Shit.
[59:04.55]He's like holding me by my beak.
[59:07.03]Oh, sorry.
[59:11.61]Yes.
[59:12.13]Alright.
[59:12.39]That's definitely a kill right there.
[59:17.09]Um.
[59:18.65]No.
[59:19.87]Oh, no.
[59:20.51]Oh, I've been tased.
[59:22.09]There we go.
[59:28.84]I'm just sniping people big time right now, guys.
[59:36.07]I am dead.
[59:36.87]I'm frozen.
[59:38.41]But so is the person that tried to drag me down with them, so that's good.
[59:43.46]Alright, it's 2v1.
[59:44.44]Oh, we gotta get this.
[59:45.14]He has a super juice.
[59:49.67]I just got wedged in the middle.
[59:53.05]Bomb incoming in three, two, one.
[59:56.07]Oh, I just destroyed him.
[59:56.93]Nice.
[59:57.25]Oh my gosh.
[59:59.05]Wait, no way.
[59:59.85]Yeah, we win.
[60:00.43]Nice.
[60:00.88]Good job.
[60:02.24]The bomb.
[60:09.78]It could have gone so much worse.
[60:12.54]Alright.
[60:13.12]This is good.
[60:14.12]I like this map a lot.
[60:15.91]This map is fun.
[60:16.71]Yeah, this is looking like a draw.
[60:27.08]Mistakes were made.
[60:27.72]Fuck.
[60:31.14]That hurts.
[60:31.58]I'm dead.
[60:32.58]I ain't getting up from this one.
[60:34.70]At least I don't think so.
[60:36.98]Oh, that was lucky.
[60:38.66]Am I the only one making death noises?
[60:41.08]Kind of weird.
[60:41.58]If it's only me.
[60:43.52]I'll join you too.
[60:45.02]Alright.
[60:48.22]Good.
[60:48.56]I got him.
[60:48.92]I got him.
[60:49.54]Oh, be careful.
[60:50.00]Don't get so close to me.
[60:52.70]Watch out.
[60:56.04]That's conductivity.
[60:56.96]That's got conductivity in it.
[60:59.00]Yeah, be careful.
[60:59.54]That has conductivity in it.
[61:00.66]That will get you.
[61:01.72]Ooh, uh, electricity.
[61:04.17]Um... The, uh... The old lady's grabbing the thing.
[61:11.15]That old lady cat has it.
[61:12.41]Ooh!
[61:14.11]Oh, I've been knocked out.
[61:15.11]Oh, that might be it for me, folks.
[61:17.31]Oh, no.
[61:21.91]I'm back.
[61:23.17]Don't let him pick this up.
[61:26.73]No.
[61:28.53]No.
[61:30.41]Yes.
[61:30.73]Oh, shit.
[61:34.39]Beautiful.
[61:34.81]Alright.
[61:36.01]There's a can of green liquid.
[61:37.63]And ow.
[61:39.25]I'm sorry.
[61:39.63]Forget about me.
[61:40.25]Forget about me.
[61:40.90]We're going to win.
[61:43.08]I'm died.
[61:44.66]I'm died.
[61:45.32]That's not a death noise.
[61:46.68]Vinny, as long as you keep that shovel, you are going to win.
[61:53.26]Vinny's going to clutch it out right here.
[61:56.00]I'm going to throw a bomb.
[61:56.97]Oh!
[61:57.29]There it is.
[61:57.83]I'm going to throw a bomb where he's going to climb.
[62:00.09]Never mind.
[62:01.21]Oh, my God.
[62:01.75]The banana peel got me.
[62:03.41]The banana peel got me.
[62:06.25]Okay.
[62:06.99]We win.
[62:07.49]Did we win, though?
[62:10.66]Oh, we did.
[62:11.12]Okay.
[62:11.78]Oh, my God.
[62:14.92]Someone.
[62:15.44]That was amazing.
[62:20.57]Nice work.
[62:22.13]Good match.
[62:22.73]Yeah, I see.
[62:23.27]This game is pretty addictive.
[62:25.80]When you start unlocking skins and stuff, it's fun.
[62:34.76]Game's fun, but the real fun part is showing your individuality.
[62:38.68]That's right.
[62:42.49]What does that mean?
[62:44.49]That means you should buy the battle pass.
[62:47.61]If I were to be behind the three point line in basketball and I took a shot and I made it, how many points would that be worth?
[62:55.24]free points oh I almost got them hey if I was behind the half court and they were said they're gonna pay me a million dollars to make the shot and I did it how much money would I get paid huh good question because you're probably gonna lose like four or five hundred thousand of that to taxes immediately um then whatever the processing fee of whatever it is um looks like I got you on this one
[63:24.42]Maybe $400,000?
[63:24.62]$500,000?
[63:24.82]Nothing.
[63:26.12]Nothing.
[63:26.40]What do you mean nothing?
[63:28.00]I mean nothing.
[63:28.48]There's a technicality actually.
[63:31.14]Alright, I'm going to be...
[63:49.21]I'm gonna be Dinosaur.
[63:51.61]Jerma, base is loaded.
[63:53.59]Batter bunts.
[63:54.53]You're the kind of guy, sorry to interrupt, to log in named Frosty Flakes and change character every round.
[64:03.57]Who is he?
[64:04.80]Where's my continuity?
[64:08.82]Oh shit, I just jumped off the train.
[64:13.22]Same.
[64:20.26]Okay, I saw a Ratatouille yesterday.
[64:22.68]You're the same guy every time, sir?
[64:24.08]The same duck?
[64:24.66]I'm the bunny.
[64:26.98]Peter Griffin?
[64:28.70]Yeah.
[64:29.42]Dude, funniest fucking thing ever.
[64:31.46]And Ratatouille, when he's sleeping and she's talking to him and he just starts snoring loudly, it's like the rudest fucking thing ever.
[64:38.82]I actually hurt myself laughing at it.
[64:43.05]What is the goal?
[64:44.37]Oh, we have to bring coal to the oven?
[64:46.27]Yeah, and stop them from doing it as well.
[64:47.93]They have a brake on their side.
[64:50.19]We have to go over there and pull the brake and be obnoxious.
[64:53.35]Oh!
[64:54.69]This one's being very obnoxious.
[64:55.67]If they are pulling our brake, get them away from us.
[65:01.10]Uh, sorry.
[65:03.18]Oh, it's a nightmare over here.
[65:09.22]No!
[65:13.97]I got a double kill.
[65:16.83]We gotta get these guys off our ship.
[65:19.39]Yeah, we're currently not in the lead.
[65:21.18]Wait.
[65:21.70]Yeah, we're not in the lead.
[65:23.96]I'm bringing Cole with me.
[65:26.48]Okay, they're like all dead.
[65:28.48]He's on our breaks.
[65:29.66]We need somebody to be dedicated to being on offense.
[65:33.12]I'm killing all of them!
[65:34.70]This guy is defending his friends so well.
[65:36.40]Ow!
[65:38.94]Okay, I got a bat, so they're not going to... No!
[65:43.31]That was my contribution to the team!
[65:45.87]Alright, I'll put this guy in the oven.
[65:51.61]Yeah, I'm putting him in the oven.
[65:55.07]He's right here.

[66:50.20]I've been doing great, though.
[66:52.22]I'm going to throw this coal down here in the middle, actually.
[66:54.18]Why am I holding it fucking backwards?
[66:57.46]I can't throw that coal in.
[66:58.43]I don't know why.
[66:59.01]I'm going to go over there and I'm going to... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[67:00.99]Alright, Polk, can you get those for you?
[67:02.61]I'll put the coal in.
[67:03.13]I'll put it in.
[67:04.23]I'm going to cause a... I'm going to be a nuisance.
[67:10.13]He's on my brakes.
[67:14.22]He just died.
[67:15.32]Good.
[67:18.93]At least it was funny looking.
[67:21.39]Oh, my God.
[67:21.83]What's up, dude?
[67:23.33]Oh, you didn't think I was going to be right behind you, did you?
[67:25.19]Oh, my God.
[67:26.15]He's playing in first person mode.
[67:28.63]And I'm grabbing this brake.
[67:29.81]Good luck.
[67:31.89]He's in our brakes.
[67:32.59]He's in our brakes.
[67:33.97]Oh, they're not going to get me.
[67:34.87]They're not going to get me off.
[67:35.93]I'm going to head over there.
[67:37.27]I'm going to try to get him.
[67:41.73]Ah.
[67:43.43]Oh.
[67:45.54]We are way ahead, though.
[67:46.34]We're good.
[67:47.16]I'm going for distraction strat.
[67:50.54]I'm just running in circles.
[67:54.52]Move them all the way.
[67:55.12]I got them in the oven.
[67:56.36]It's burning.
[67:57.12]Oops.
[68:00.09]Oh, that was wonderful.
[68:05.49]Oh, man.
[68:07.45]Yeah, it's over.
[68:08.07]I don't think they're coming back from this.
[68:10.07]Grab it.
[68:10.47]I heard the nuke arm.
[68:17.11]I'm slowing them down to a crawl.
[68:22.05]Alright, that was good teamwork.
[68:35.11]That is the third time I've forcibly ejected myself from this train.
[68:38.57]I saw that.
[68:40.78]I've done that so many times.
[68:41.60]He's holding our brakes!
[68:42.30]He's holding our brakes!
[68:45.44]Oh, that's a bomb!
[68:50.57]Wow.
[68:51.67]That solved that problem, I think.
[68:55.05]We're at the finish line.
[69:05.28]You get him!
[69:05.72]Yeah!
[69:07.92]Get his ass!
[69:12.65]That was almost Donkey Kong music.
[69:14.65]I was going for Beavis, but that works too.
[69:17.33]No, no, not you.
[69:18.17]The game.
[69:18.91]Oh.
[69:21.03]For a second, I was like, well, how is that Donkey Kong?
[69:27.40]Do I get $1,000 for finishing it?
[69:30.22]Nirvana is cool.
[69:32.60]Nirvana?
[69:34.03]Nirvana.
[69:34.85]That was really good, actually.
[69:40.37]Oh, man.
[69:40.59]Oh, -2.
[69:42.75]Can we get some minus twos?
[69:48.75]Nope.
[69:49.25]Nope.
[69:49.69]Nope.
[69:50.11]Nope.
[69:50.43]I'm seeing a lot of plus twos over here.
[69:52.13]Nope.
[69:54.25]Not even close.
[69:56.45]Oh, I had a delay.
[69:57.27]I had an eight-second delay on my stream.
[69:59.29]They must have thought the other thing you said was funnier.
[70:01.01]Fuck.
[70:01.71]Oh, I was laughing at Stern's joke from earlier.
[70:08.28]I was watching the stream.
[70:08.96]What are you guys talking about?
[70:10.97]Let's do Flab.
[70:12.57]This one has a big gravity device in the middle.
[70:14.57]It gave us Gator.
[70:15.74]It's too late.
[70:17.18]It gave us Gator, yeah.
[70:18.50]What?
[70:20.76]I like this one.
[70:23.32]What the heck?
[70:24.62]I voted for Black Hole.
[70:26.00]Unless we... Yeah, that was weird.
[70:27.71]I don't know.
[70:28.57]Well, we're good at this one.
[70:34.07]I'm going to be the... Hammerhead.
[70:40.64]Smart shark ones because it's a water map.
[70:43.56]Smart.
[70:44.22]Yeah.
[70:44.44]He does get 10% swim buff.
[70:46.68]Yeah.
[70:50.52]Oh, I like that costume, Pogue.
[70:52.63]Thank you.
[70:57.53]Bomb right next to us.
[71:00.63]Oh, God.
[71:00.97]They just throw you right in the middle of everything.
[71:04.47]That was an insta loss.
[71:05.71]This guy has the same skin as me.
[71:07.66]Can you guys kill him?
[71:09.64]Try it.
[71:14.04]There's like four ducks in a pile.
[71:15.50]I don't know which duck I am.
[71:17.74]Oh, I just Omega Punched that person.
[71:20.40]Oh.
[71:21.86]Oh.
[71:26.24]Oh, shit.
[71:27.10]Oh, my God.
[71:27.62]I'm flying.
[71:28.48]I think you're okay.
[71:32.42]Oh, no.
[71:33.38]The wave's got me.
[71:33.90]Grab my hand.
[71:34.38]No.
[71:35.40]I think it's just... There's only one person left.
[71:37.86]What is wrong with my... What?
[71:39.16]I died?
[71:39.74]Why did I... I just had like a heart attack.
[71:43.02]What just happened?
[71:46.14]Why did I die?
[71:47.26]You got the schmoves.
[71:49.80]I just accidentally won.
[71:51.36]Nice.
[71:53.16]Did you throw that fish?
[71:54.57]Vinny wins by doing nothing.
[71:56.67]You did a lot.
[71:57.93]Take credit.
[71:59.09]Oh, God.
[72:01.13]No.
[72:01.53]No way.
[72:02.23]Oh, crap.
[72:04.11]Insta-death.
[72:05.23]How do you get out of the water?
[72:09.47]I hold right trigger and...
[72:13.40]Well, I just died instantly.
[72:17.12]Be careful.
[72:17.48]I have this thing.
[72:18.04]I'm sorry.
[72:18.40]Sorry.
[72:18.60]Sorry.
[72:18.76]Sorry.
[72:19.24]Oh, no.
[72:20.80]Oh, no.
[72:21.22]That was my fault.
[72:22.20]What?
[72:22.90]How did this happen to me?
[72:24.66]How did that even happen?
[72:26.36]I was so concerned about hitting you with that that I freaked out and just died.
[72:30.42]That was a team kill.
[72:31.29]I'm sorry, Jerm.
[72:32.31]Uh-oh.
[72:34.87]I was so scared.
[72:35.41]You're going to get a real talking to after this.
[72:38.29]Oh, watch this.
[72:39.37]Watch this.
[72:40.27]Watch this.
[72:41.15]Watch this.
[72:45.83]There's no way.
[72:47.37]Where did you go?
[72:48.61]Are you in a tunnel?
[72:50.07]Poke streaming from an underpass.
[72:53.87]You got blown into the other room.
[72:56.01]I ran away.
[72:56.95]I ran away.
[72:58.99]He just killed his whole team.
[73:01.15]He just killed his whole team.
[73:02.27]It's just me versus the duck.
[73:05.69]Oh no.
[73:08.15]Did you do that?
[73:11.26]Ster.
[73:11.78]Who threw that fish?
[73:13.08]I threw the fish.
[73:13.88]That wasn't me.
[73:14.74]That wasn't me, chat.
[73:16.66]He's working against us.
[73:17.42]I threw the bomb.
[73:17.82]I had no money for the fish.
[73:19.40]Review the footage, chat.
[73:20.54]Review the footage.
[73:28.79]Oh, shit.
[73:29.21]He's got the thing.
[73:31.45]Okay, good.
[73:33.47]Dump him.
[73:35.01]Good.
[73:39.15]I have been rusticated.
[73:40.29]I'm cursed on the map.
[73:41.25]I'm cursed.
[73:41.93]I'm cursed.
[73:42.71]I'm done.
[73:43.61]Oh, dumped.
[73:50.86]How?
[73:55.44]How?
[73:58.58]Shit!
[74:01.83]I... I couldn't...
[74:08.94]We'd be winning if you dodged that fish.
[74:13.17]I don't know where it came from.
[74:14.83]I don't know where it came from.
[74:18.97]It was probably the enemy team.
[74:21.25]Where am I?
[74:29.52]Yeah, I died instantly three times.
[74:30.80]Oh, shit.
[74:32.50]I don't know what happened, Fred.
[74:34.52]Somewhat my experience.
[74:35.52]That picture looks cool, though.
[74:36.38]You see the shark?
[74:38.31]You look pretty damn cool, yeah.
[74:39.57]He's going to drop the sickest mixtape of October 11th, 2023.
[74:43.01]Bandcamp is going to blow up from it.
[74:46.19]Bandcamp?
[74:47.13]Who the hell uses Bandcamp still?
[74:49.17]I kind of do.
[74:50.31]I love Bandcamp.
[74:51.01]I know, I know.
[74:52.37]Yeah.
[74:53.81]I know.
[74:54.91]Yeah.
[74:56.29]The new kids use Criken files.
[75:00.53]Vinny, I can feel the side eye from across the ocean.
[75:05.97]Wait, are we across oceans?
[75:07.09]I did that to piss him off.
[75:11.04]No, no buzz ball.
[75:12.90]No buzz ball.
[75:13.86]Okay.
[75:14.16]Buzz ball is just another sports one.
[75:23.76]I know backhand is good.
[75:24.76]I'm just... You're just messing around.
[75:27.02]That's okay.
[75:27.46]Everyone's on Kazaa these days anyway.
[75:30.14]Kazaa.
[75:31.92]The real shit.
[75:34.06]What do people actually use?
[75:35.79]Is it like Spotify?
[75:37.23]Isn't it most people on Spotify?
[75:40.15]Spotify, I think.
[75:41.95]So, yeah, for me, I use Spotify and I mainly upload my music to Spotify.
[75:47.43]Spotify, for sure, yeah.
[75:49.47]Some people use SoundCloud.
[75:50.70]I just can't bring myself to use it.
[75:52.78]Oh, yeah, SoundCloud.
[75:53.80]I forgot about SoundCloud.
[75:56.64]Bandcamp is good because you get a lot of the proceeds.
[76:00.04]What about Tidal?
[76:02.35]I don't even know what that is.
[76:03.33]Are they letting everyone on there?
[76:04.83]Alright, well, it's out of focus.
[76:13.07]Oh shit!
[76:13.99]That's a lot of that.
[76:19.01]That was an amazing comeback I just had just by accident there.
[76:25.99]I don't know exactly what's happening over here, but I think I came out victorious somehow.
[76:36.51]I'm doing a little bit of a running strat.
[76:40.27]Oh yeah, that happens sometimes, yeah.
[76:41.59]Gotta be careful with the, uh, electricity.
[76:44.97]Where am I?
[76:45.29]To, uh, electricity.
[76:47.70]Oh, you hit me.
[76:52.58]This guy's a big-ass hammer.
[76:54.52]Don't like it.
[76:58.60]How have I been down there for so long?
[76:59.94]Alright, oh, and in three, yep.
[77:06.12]I'm holding on to you.
[77:06.84]Don't worry.
[77:07.74]Thanks, Poke.
[77:08.14]You saved me.
[77:09.51]I got you.
[77:11.57]Vinny, come up here.
[77:16.63]Try.
[77:16.89]Give me a second.
[77:17.43]I'm trying to get this guy.
[77:18.23]Are you climbing the wall?
[77:19.52]Yeah, let's just get up here and hide.
[77:22.70]Actually, not a bad idea.
[77:24.84]Coward's way out.
[77:29.69]Somebody's throwing fish at me.
[77:31.19]Is it Ster?
[77:31.95]I think you may have killed us both.
[77:33.45]It's okay.
[77:33.97]We're both dead.
[77:35.32]It's Ster, for sure.
[77:38.06]Ster, stop throwing fish at me.
[77:39.80]I'm alive!
[77:46.87]Oh my god, it worked!
[77:49.41]It actually worked.
[77:57.99]Oh there's there's there's a coup.
[78:07.10]OK.
[78:10.62]Alright, I gotta get over here somebody.
[78:18.94]Somebody grab grab that other thing.
[78:26.33]This is insane.
[78:26.97]That was not me, sir.
[78:28.13]That was not me.
[78:29.21]No, I swear I had the idea, but I didn't do it.
[78:33.13]I didn't click.
[78:38.26]Use the environment to your advantage.
[78:42.24]Oh, thanks, loading screen tip.
[78:44.80]You're welcome.
[78:46.52]No.
[78:48.46]Sir, help.
[78:50.50]I can't help.
[78:50.98]He's too crazy.
[78:55.54]Careful.
[78:55.86]I am holding this wrong.
[78:58.64]This Golden Gator's got the nunchucks.
[79:00.30]You can't go near him.
[79:02.08]Yes!
[79:02.24]Can't tell him nothing.
[79:04.24]Ah!
[79:08.84]Oh, sassy.
[79:10.14]Oh my goodness.
[79:10.88]He hits me with the backswing every time.
[79:12.68]He doesn't even mean to do it.
[79:20.01]Ah!
[79:20.21]God!
[79:20.53]The backswing again!
[79:25.08]He's just a cyclone of fury.
[79:31.86]Oh my God.
[79:33.08]I have been unconscious from a headshot the whole game.
[79:37.19]I saved you.
[79:40.19]Oh, he's still swinging at me.
[79:42.45]I got him.
[79:42.87]I got him.
[79:43.19]I got him.
[79:45.95]We're getting out of here.
[79:51.87]I made it all the way up.
[79:53.24]How do I drop this?
[79:54.54]Oh, poke.
[79:54.96]What's up?
[79:55.54]Hey, what's up, man?
[79:58.04]Oh!
[80:00.76]That killed me!
[80:01.80]I'm dead!
[80:02.36]I'm dead, man!
[80:07.62]Who threw a bomb at me?
[80:09.24]Oh my god, the fish.
[80:10.28]The fish took me out.
[80:11.32]The fish took me out.
[80:12.84]Knock that guy off and we win.
[80:15.48]Wait, they were dead the whole time?
[80:17.62]Polk, I did not think I was going to make that, let alone actually hit you, and let alone actually hit you far enough.
[80:22.64]That was very impressive.
[80:24.56]I'm starting to get it.
[80:26.88]I'm starting to, you know, log in.
[80:30.88]Lock in.
[80:32.18]Yeah, lock in.
[80:35.18]Well, I say log in, but, you know, I got to speak the language while I'm here.
[80:41.23]I'm 38 years old.
[80:43.15]I am.
[80:44.09]Grown-ass man.
[80:45.59]Wait, are you really, sir?
[80:48.31]I'm 33.
[80:49.31]Oh, not sir.
[80:49.89]I'm in poke.
[80:50.50]Why was there a question mark at the end of that?
[80:53.84]I'm 30.
[80:55.00]I'm 33.
[80:56.46]I'm 38, along with Jerm.
[80:58.22]Yeah.
[80:59.52]Wait, really?
[80:59.94]Yeah, we're old men.
[81:02.94]Men of a certain age.
[81:04.42]Yeah.
[81:06.44]Does the 30s go by fast?
[81:07.52]Because I just got, you know, I'm 33.
[81:09.02]Yeah.
[81:10.00]Yeah, it kind of does.
[81:13.63]Actually, after 30, it's kind of smooth sailing.
[81:20.09]All the pressure gets removed.
[81:21.29]Who cares?
[81:23.75]Yeah, my dad said I did a good job.
[81:26.95]We're going to Dairy Queen.
[81:29.39]I don't even need to win.
[81:31.63]Grown-ass man.
[81:33.27]Grown-ass man going to Dairy Queen.
[81:36.05]Sorry.
[81:37.23]Grown-ass man.
[81:40.26]Is that over?
[81:41.22]That was the last time, right?
[81:42.26]Yeah, it was the last time.
[81:43.54]It's still happening.
[81:44.66]That was on the last episode of Hanging out with friends, playing games.
[81:47.93]Alright, Sterv.
[82:00.05]What's the game plan here?
[82:03.53]What map was this?
[82:06.48]The bridge again.
[82:09.20]I'm just going to get knocked off immediately is the plan on this one.
[82:12.28]Okay.
[82:12.60]You're going to get knocked up?
[82:14.95]I'm going to get knocked up and then I'm going to use my baby bump as a defense mechanism.
[82:22.95]And use a diaphy on the toilet for two minutes.
[82:25.99]I just punched you in the head.
[82:26.95]I'm sorry.
[82:27.58]With some nice reverb.
[82:28.52]Okay, no jumping here.
[82:33.94]Yeah, jumping is actually bad here.
[82:38.88]You want to come with me?
[82:39.52]That's fine.
[82:40.08]No!
[82:45.77]Wait, we're the blue team?
[82:47.05]Yeah, I thought the same thing too.
[82:51.76]Oh boy.
[82:52.56]Stay up here.
[82:56.02]How?
[82:59.38]That sucked.
[83:02.69]Oh, wait, no, we're not red.
[83:04.09]Just live.
[83:05.07]Just live.
[83:06.81]We're killing the reds.
[83:07.97]I'm not going to take advice from a junior minister.
[83:12.24]What an absurd proposition.
[83:17.36]I'm sorry.
[83:20.92]I'm sorry.
[83:21.36]You weren't meant to be catching those hands.
[83:27.25]Oh, I didn't mean it.
[83:29.99]I'm dead.
[83:34.72]What?
[83:35.54]Come here!
[83:35.90]Grab my hand!
[83:36.28]Grab my hand!
[83:36.70]Grab my hand!
[83:37.18]Grab my hand!
[83:39.94]Grab my hand!
[83:40.88]Who is this?
[83:48.89]I'm just realizing what the fuck you were just saying.
[83:59.58]Yeah, bombs don't work so great on this level.
[84:02.38]We won!
[84:03.42]What?
[84:03.92]Oh, we're blue.
[84:05.90]I forgot.
[84:10.37]Damn it.
[84:15.01]Oh, my God.
[84:16.57]No!
[84:21.19]Oh, good.
[84:24.19]Are you hiding in a bush?
[84:25.35]Help me out, baby!
[84:27.47]I'm hurt!
[84:27.89]I'm hurt!
[84:31.81]We won.
[84:32.17]Don't worry.
[84:32.69]We're good.
[84:39.66]Well, all four of us lived.
[84:40.74]I just... Oh!
[84:42.48]Oh!
[84:42.64]Whoa!
[84:42.94]Whoa!
[84:43.12]Whoa!
[84:43.35]We repeated the joke.
[84:44.91]-2.
[84:45.53]No!
[84:49.28]That's me.
[84:50.36]I know.
[84:50.86]I'm sorry.
[84:52.06]I saw it.
[84:52.64]It was in slow motion on my screen.
[84:54.98]It's me.
[84:56.21]No, let go of me.
[84:57.33]It's me.
[84:57.73]Let go.
[84:58.63]Stop.
[84:59.77]Ow, ow, ow, ow.
[85:00.65]My arm.
[85:00.99]My arm doesn't bend that way.
[85:02.19]Ow.
[85:02.25]What the hell?
[85:04.87]Come on.
[85:08.91]Oh, shit.
[85:09.53]Oh, no.
[85:10.05]I'm going to die now.
[85:14.34]Bomb!
[85:15.70]Oh.
[85:17.44]Oh, jeez.
[85:19.04]That bomb.
[85:19.94]Wow.
[85:20.68]Did that bomb just kill everybody?
[85:23.36]I'm alive.
[85:24.42]It's 2v1, Vinny.
[85:25.28]Be careful.
[85:25.88]Won't be for long.
[85:28.52]I've seen you win these.
[85:31.09]Man, if that bomb was one of them, you would have just tossed them out of the map.
[85:34.35]I'm throwing a bomb.
[85:35.17]Good luck.
[85:37.61]Yeah, those don't work so great on this level, do they?
[85:41.21]Oh, that's going to be bad.
[85:45.77]Oh, it's okay.
[85:46.57]It's alright.
[85:46.89]Okay, we can win this.
[85:50.39]We can win this.
[85:51.29]I ran out of bridge.
[85:52.27]I wasn't sure how much bridge was left.
[85:54.13]I died instantly.
[85:55.28]I'm out.
[85:59.14]I'm willing to be sacrificed.
[86:01.44]Oh, no.
[86:05.00]Yeah, that was not great.
[86:07.20]That got me.
[86:09.46]That bomb got me.
[86:15.46]That's not good.
[86:16.18]Is it just me?
[86:18.48]Alright, somebody throw something.
[86:20.76]Yeah.
[86:23.47]Oh, boy.
[86:24.33]You threw?
[86:31.17]How did I throw?
[86:32.25]It was 4v1.
[86:35.37]We just lost the game.
[86:36.49]I threw.
[86:37.79]I threw up.
[86:45.22]do you need a minute I don't need a minute I need a breath mint oh how do you guys feel about tums since we're all lads in our 30s I never use it is it good it's not good it worked but it's not good I actually I don't mind it no no they're good they work but you know you can get addicted to tums and you're really good
[87:12.70]Yeah, your body starts to want the Tums.
[87:17.50]And then, like, after every meal, you're, like, dying, and it's like, please give me the Tums, father.
[87:23.03]That's what your esophagus says to you.
[87:24.25]I had a phase where I would eat them with milk.
[87:28.53]And I never really, like, felt like I needed more.
[87:33.63]What?
[87:34.57]That's normal.
[87:35.86]Why milk, though?
[87:37.98]What, 2%?
[87:39.85]No, why milk?
[87:40.61]Are you, like, milk and Tums?
[87:43.61]Like a breakfast.
[87:45.22]With a spoon.
[87:48.66]Okay, go look at the price tag on a box of Frosted Flakes and then look at Tums.
[87:56.51]Bro, he's making a funny story.
[88:02.77]Oh!
[88:04.03]That's why he only spends a minute on the toilet.
[88:05.89]It just passes through him.
[88:07.99]Just goes from his mouth to esophagus directly out.
[88:16.32]Oh, hey, listen to this, guys.
[88:17.98]You know who's like encroaching on fucking territory big time?
[88:22.82]Are we getting political?
[88:24.12]Lucky Charms.
[88:24.88]Shut up.
[88:26.50]Dude, Lucky Charms?
[88:30.51]He has his own Count Chocula.
[88:32.57]It's like, oh, look, it's not Count Chocula.
[88:35.33]It's chocolate and it's just bats and it's scary.
[88:37.81]It's literally Lucky Charms, but it's just Count Chocula.
[88:40.49]They're just copping.
[88:42.57]Oh, no, I'm dead.
[88:44.26]Hey, question.
[88:44.76]What do we do on this level?
[88:45.74]What is happening?
[88:47.56]You got to hold on to the chain.
[88:48.68]Hold on to something.
[88:49.32]It's not candy at all, Jerma.
[88:50.90]It's just like chocolate cereal.
[88:53.28]Well, I mean, it's just Count Chocula, but it's just the Lucky Charms.
[88:56.67]What's the Lucky Charms Leprechaun's name?
[88:58.99]Leprechaun name?
[89:00.13]Jimmy.
[89:01.73]Is it?
[89:02.85]No, I don't know.
[89:04.01]Isn't it like Lucky or something?
[89:07.09]Oh, yeah, there's Lucky.
[89:12.10]Somebody please stop him from doing this to me.
[89:16.44]But just in the grocery store, looking over and being like, wait a minute, that's Lucky Charms.
[89:23.48]That's chocolate cereal.
[89:26.42]Oh, look, chocolate bats and ghosts and shit.
[89:31.34]Why are you so upset?
[89:32.93]Because Count Chocula is my favorite cereal.
[89:40.37]Oh.
[89:41.87]Dodged.
[89:42.87]Lucky the leprechaun, yeah.
[89:44.33]Lucky charms, Count Chocula rips off.
[89:46.17]Sir, you have to grab onto the chain for the next one.
[89:49.46]I know, Pope.
[89:51.00]Hold on a minute.
[89:54.25]The chain.
[89:56.27]Oh, I thought I just did something cool.
[89:59.41]You would have grabbed him.
[90:00.79]Stop him.
[90:01.07]Never break the chain.
[90:02.01]If you stop him, we win.
[90:02.85]Sir, if you stop him, we win.
[90:05.61]Sir, you had to get the chain.
[90:06.81]Good.
[90:07.11]Very good.
[90:07.73]Very good.
[90:08.25]Very good.
[90:09.35]Okay.
[90:09.73]I can't grab him.
[90:10.75]I got it.
[90:11.67]I got him.
[90:12.29]I got him.
[90:12.77]I got him.
[90:13.19]I'm pulling him.
[90:14.65]As long as you... I'm going to murder him.
[90:17.31]Sharknado.
[90:20.11]Yeah.
[90:21.17]There you go.
[90:22.59]Yeah, but that wasn't the chain.
[90:24.26]The chain is a song that Lindsey Buckingham recorded by singing into his toilet.
[90:30.51]Why do you know every, like, toilet fact for, like, every song that was made in a bathroom?
[90:35.84]Oh, shit, I needed that.
[90:43.79]I just listed, guys, I'm a big Skibbity Toilet fan.
[90:47.15]Hey, I said that and people fucking made fun of me.
[90:50.29]People were like, dude, you're 38 and you watch Skibbity Toilet.
[90:52.76]And I said, Vinny did it too.
[90:54.54]I threw you under the bus.
[90:55.18]I changed my name on Twitter to Skibbity Vinny for like a month.
[90:58.78]So, I mean.
[91:00.98]So, there's two 38-year-olds that have seen it.
[91:03.87]Crone ass man.
[91:04.81]Kryken has watched all of it.
[91:06.15]I've watched a couple highlights, but I think he's seen the whole thing.
[91:09.01]Okay, okay.
[91:11.56]Sure.
[91:14.05]Don't you dare.
[91:14.71]You're coming after me.
[91:16.27]Oops.
[91:19.93]Tornado incoming.
[91:20.79]I defended you.
[91:21.39]This guy wants to kill me so bad.
[91:24.19]Oh my god.
[91:25.11]I can feel the rage.
[91:29.73]Hold on to something.
[91:32.01]Ster, hold on to me.
[91:32.77]That's not the chain.
[91:34.56]I know.
[91:34.80]I was trying to get him off.
[91:36.12]You guys are so stupid.
[91:37.36]I'm dead.
[91:39.42]Oh, you told me to touch the chain.
[91:40.72]I ran out of stamina.
[91:41.72]Oh shit, I'm gonna run out of stamina too.
[91:44.64]Oh, I made it.
[91:48.22]Oh, almost all of them got dropped in.
[91:51.44]Their whole team went in.
[91:52.42]Monster, no!
[91:54.48]Yo, yo, who's dead?
[91:55.98]I'll be ranged DPS.
[91:59.34]We're all alive actually.
[92:01.38]Yeah, it's just dog.
[92:02.65]Trying to punch this guy in the back of the head.
[92:04.03]I knocked him out.
[92:04.39]Like a donkey punch.
[92:05.17]There you go, there you go.
[92:05.91]Give him a good donkey punch.
[92:06.99]Oh, fuck.
[92:11.25]I got him.
[92:11.75]Let me get him.
[92:12.49]Guys, the chain.
[92:14.25]Who shot me in the back?
[92:15.49]Must never break it.
[92:20.91]What?
[92:22.00]Why is this thing so flimsy?
[92:23.18]I'm pulling him in.
[92:27.74]Oh.
[92:28.28]Did we make it?
[92:29.66]Guys.
[92:30.82]Hold on.
[92:31.16]There's a chain.
[92:36.26]I'll stop.
[92:38.16]This whole chain thing.
[92:38.84]That's good advice.
[92:39.47]That's good advice.
[92:40.58]That actually is the only way to guarantee fail.
[92:42.46]I just saw the DM.
[92:42.92]I'm sorry, guys.
[92:45.56]Oh, I almost had the elimination.
[92:46.73]Hold on!
[92:53.41]I'm out of stamina.
[92:59.94]So, Jimi Hendrix had the idea for his first album when he was in the toilet.
[93:05.70]Electric Ladyland.
[93:06.92]That's true.
[93:07.22]Daft Punk, actually, first track was...
[93:10.49]Electric Ladyland was originally called the Porcelain Ladyland.
[93:14.73]Uh-oh.
[93:16.93]We're fighting over a bomb over here.
[93:18.29]Rumor has it Daft Punk was stuck on the toilet for four hours and they just kept saying, around the world, around the world.
[93:24.56]That's true.
[93:26.14]On a flight.
[93:26.70]On an airplane flight.
[93:28.72]On an airplane toilet.
[93:32.24]Their helmets were originally made out of toilet.
[93:35.33]I got... Don't let go of this.
[93:37.41]Folk, we have to be careful.
[93:41.47]Wow, that sucked for me.
[93:45.63]Around the world, around the world.
[93:49.01]See, uh... They don't know about the chain, Jerma.
[93:52.01]They don't.
[93:55.63]Alright, Jerma, I'm gonna throw a bomb at this guy.
[93:58.47]I'm just kidding.
[93:59.91]You can beat the golden dog.
[94:01.64]Alright, I'm gonna go this way, you go that way, Polk.
[94:05.40]Get his ass, get his ass.
[94:07.60]I was gonna bomb him.
[94:09.06]Yup.
[94:14.51]Alright, just grab something.
[94:15.92]Your chain.
[94:16.36]Uh-oh.
[94:16.66]I'm going to try to knock the bomb out of the way with a fish.
[94:22.92]I failed.
[94:25.12]Sorry, I screamed.
[94:26.40]I think we're all dead.
[94:27.68]Swim.
[94:28.66]Swim.
[94:29.68]Swim, honey.
[94:34.26]Who landed first?
[94:36.00]I'm holding onto something.
[94:37.95]Oh, wow.
[94:38.41]Okay.
[94:39.45]Look, I'm holding on.
[94:40.33]What the hell?
[94:40.73]Hey, guys, so Nirvana's first album is called Bleach, and bleach is actually the product that you use to clean your toilet.
[94:47.29]So... Did I take this too far?
[94:50.53]Is it not funny anymore?
[94:52.12]Alright.
[94:52.38]I think it's still funny.
[94:54.56]That's the one you came up with.
[94:56.12]That's the one you came up with.
[94:58.02]I was thinking about that for the past three minutes, guys.
[95:06.37]skivity I got toilet facts I'll keep them coming don't worry did you know that across the world in in Australia the the water go the other way did you guys know that did you know scared of toilets because she played Legend of Zelda and a hand comes out of the toilet oh yeah and majora's mask that's right yeah she hasn't used the toilet in 20 years damn
[95:34.26]Wait, what?
[95:35.75]I processed that as if you were telling me the truth.
[95:40.15]Are you serious, though?
[95:41.61]Yeah.
[95:42.41]Yeah, the water goes the other way.
[95:43.49]I haven't played Zelda games, so I can still use toilets.
[95:46.87]Do you have an outhouse?
[95:49.79]No, but the power was out for like six months.
[95:52.59]Well, not the power.
[95:53.35]We didn't have a toilet for like six months.
[95:55.22]Do you have a stink basin?
[95:58.40]No.
[95:59.72]We have a neighborhood.
[96:08.78]I don't get it, but I don't want you to continue that.
[96:10.94]Can you imagine the mindset of someone who's walking their dog and they watch their dog poop on the sidewalk and then they just keep walking?
[96:20.08]Can you put yourself in that person's body and think about it?
[96:22.80]I guess I could for a minute.
[96:27.61]It's biodegradable.
[96:28.89]This one is a sports one.
[96:30.81]Yeah.
[96:44.59]You gotta put the ball in there.
[96:46.01]The ball goes in, and then... You can also get caught in there too and go flying.
[96:52.57]I'm gonna go murder.
[96:55.47]Oh, we're red team again.
[96:59.63]I got ball.
[97:01.70]And why are you trying to take it out of my hands?
[97:03.58]I'm holding their best play... Oh, never mind.
[97:07.06]You just tried to grab it out of my hands.
[97:09.66]I did not.
[97:11.48]Did not.
[97:12.66]I did not.
[97:16.01]I did not.
[97:25.86]Oh, so that happens.
[97:30.65]Watch out.
[97:32.47]Okay, the duck is too good.
[97:34.31]What the heck?
[97:35.23]He just grabs it, dude.
[97:36.97]And then he walks towards the objective and he puts it in it.
[97:40.04]That's too good.
[97:42.23]He's got a fancy duck skin.
[97:45.45]He's using a fight stick.
[97:46.67]It's much fucking harder to play against people that actually use it.
[97:51.49]That's true.
[97:53.18]I knocked his head off.
[97:54.62]I grabbed him again.
[97:55.20]Alright, let's body block.
[97:57.74]Where are we going to?
[97:58.80]Right ahead.
[98:01.02]We're throwing it in blue.
[98:02.56]Okay.
[98:04.46]You know what?
[98:06.06]That's not great.
[98:09.64]When I'm on the red team, I feel like I'm the enemy.
[98:13.83]Oh, the misery.
[98:14.79]I tried.
[98:21.51]Oh, the scibity.
[98:23.37]Oh, the scibity.
[98:24.27]I know.
[98:25.35]I like brain-fucked myself with that, Jerma.
[98:28.38]Where now I just think about that like twice a week.
[98:31.20]Yeah, that's what I want to try to prevent that.
[98:39.10]They're just playing the game.
[98:40.30]They're just walking forward and pressing the button.
[98:45.15]How do we come back from this?
[98:47.63]We're going to get defunded.
[98:51.24]We're going to have to find a way to save the team.
[98:55.48]We got it.
[99:01.08]We go.
[99:01.84]Yeah, very nice.
[99:03.31]Good, good, good.
[99:04.53]OK.
[99:10.41]I'm in the hamster wheel.
[99:16.18]Oh, wow.
[99:19.42]If somebody can throw it down here, I gotta clean... He just gets it!
[99:24.47]No, he's kidding.
[99:26.25]Yeah, there's still a lot of hackers in this game.
[99:29.15]No, these guys are part of the... They've been hacking in the community for a long time.
[99:35.23]The Discord talks about them a lot.
[99:39.58]Round six!
[99:41.20]We didn't get beat?
[99:49.06]So the lightning ball explodes when two people grab it and pull it?
[99:53.77]Yeah, when too many people have it.
[99:55.23]Pass.
[99:55.53]Pass it up.
[99:57.27]I'm open.
[99:58.81]There it is.
[99:59.13]Okay.
[100:03.33]Down.
[100:03.77]I'm open.
[100:04.91]Pass.
[100:07.50]Pass.
[100:07.74]I'm open.
[100:09.74]Try it.
[100:12.62]This guy is so good at this.
[100:17.03]He just lifts it up.
[100:17.89]Yeah, so that was pretty bad.
[100:20.61]Grown-ass man hacking.
[100:21.75]Look at that.
[100:23.27]In a kid's game.
[100:26.00]That was just like very good gameplay.
[100:36.84]Let's not fight.
[100:37.68]This end screen really shows how violence is built into humanity at its core.
[100:43.36]Well, this is animality.
[100:45.27]Animality.
[100:47.49]There are men controlling these animals.
[100:50.17]Growing ass men playing kids games.
[100:52.15]This is not a kids game.
[100:53.47]This is an E for everyone.
[101:04.26]Wait, so does that mean if it's E for everyone, it's not a kid's game?
[101:07.78]It means it's for everyone.
[101:08.76]It doesn't matter if you're young or old.
[101:12.10]But if kids are included in that, doesn't that also make it a kid's game?
[101:17.46]I think it's a very accessible video game for any particular age bracket.
[101:22.07]What about grannies?
[101:24.01]Oh, yeah.
[101:26.05]Are you trying to tell me that a granny wouldn't pick this up and be like...
[101:31.80]Let me be the dog this time.
[101:33.26]No, that's a cute dog.
[101:35.32]That's right.
[101:36.20]I'd like to get my gums on this one.
[101:38.96]Yeah, now let me give me that shovel and get the fuck over here.
[101:41.82]Yeah, yeah, yeah!
[101:45.55]Grandma, what the fuck?
[101:47.31]The chain!
[101:47.79]I was in a chain gang when I was young.
[101:53.77]That was quiet for too long.
[101:56.75]I had to say something.
[101:58.05]I bashed some motherfucking skulls in when I was a young woman.
[102:04.75]You have a bunch of cool skins.
[102:07.25]Yeah.
[102:07.53]I bought them all.
[102:10.08]Yeah.
[102:14.82]Once you get all the skins, there's nothing to play for anymore.
[102:18.88]Until they add more, though.
[102:20.18]Saj.
[102:22.29]Saj.
[102:22.67]Saj.
[102:22.79]Saj.
[102:23.79]This is a good one.
[102:27.17]I like this one a lot.
[102:35.44]That's my native tongue, sir.
[102:36.46]We just knocked each other out.
[102:37.48]Why am I gonna die?
[102:38.36]Everyone dies.
[103:02.99]Ooh.
[103:03.89]God dang it.
[103:15.22]I fucked that person up big time.
[103:22.63]Not like this.
[103:23.67]Um, dude?
[103:26.67]What the fuck was that all about?
[103:28.27]Oh, it's over now.
[103:29.41]Check this out.
[103:33.69]I'm checking it.
[103:34.39]I'm checking it.
[103:35.05]Watch out.
[103:37.39]Oh.
[103:40.27]Careful.
[103:42.75]Dodge roll.
[103:43.75]Knock him in the air.
[103:44.35]Watch out for the bomb.
[103:46.09]Bingo.
[103:48.41]Keep away from me.
[103:49.01]Get the fuck out of here.
[103:56.42]Oh.
[103:58.56]Well, yes, I would love that shovel.
[103:59.96]Thank you.
[104:02.28]Oh.
[104:02.68]Oh God.
[104:03.30]Get this guy out of here.
[104:09.06]Nice, Ster.
[104:10.20]I enjoyed that.
[104:10.86]It made a good sound on contact.
[104:13.14]Oh.
[104:13.28]Thanks.
[104:13.86]Okay.
[104:14.28]I'll take care of this guy.
[104:15.20]I don't want to hit anybody with this.
[104:16.08]I don't want to hit anybody with this.
[104:20.00]Oh.
[104:22.10]I'll die for it.
[104:22.98]Watch.
[104:23.42]No.
[104:23.52]He's dead.
[104:23.72]He's dead.
[104:23.98]He's dead.
[104:25.22]Yeah.
[104:26.64]Yeah.
[104:28.93]Good call outs.
[104:33.57]Okay.
[104:40.19]They've got a gun.
[104:48.51]Okay, be careful.
[104:49.29]We're going to close line somebody.
[104:50.97]I got you Vinny.
[104:57.95]Oh, come on.
[104:58.33]I thought you knew a secret method to get me up quicker and you just carried me.
[105:03.30]Gun.
[105:08.80]Whoa!
[105:09.42]He threw me so far.
[105:16.56]Oh my god.
[105:20.81]Hit him!
[105:25.45]Dude, they need to teach these animals how to climb.
[105:27.51]Yeah, I agree with that.
[105:32.76]Keep this guy down.
[105:33.72]Keep this guy down.
[105:38.22]Why is he still alive?
[105:40.64]I don't know.
[105:41.08]He shouldn't be.
[105:41.96]Oh, now he's not.
[105:42.82]I am upside down.
[105:43.64]My head is under the fucking ice.
[105:44.95]You've got to be kidding me.
[105:46.15]I am going to smash my hands together in a clap and go, what the heck?
[105:57.03]We're good.
[105:58.14]Bomb coming in.
[105:58.66]Where should I put it?
[106:05.74]Putting a big-ass bomb.
[106:07.52]Bomb coming in.
[106:08.72]Middle is fine, I think.
[106:09.92]Bomb is directly in the middle.
[106:11.46]Two bombs.
[106:11.96]Big bomb with you.
[106:12.83]Big bomb.
[106:13.71]Uh-oh.
[106:15.89]That was underwhelming.
[106:17.39]Underwhelming.
[106:17.87]I need water.
[106:19.27]We got this, man.
[106:20.51]It's 2v3.
[106:21.65]And one of them is really separated.
[106:23.21]I think you just got me.
[106:24.83]Yeah, I did.
[106:25.09]Oh, no.

[106:54.72]Oh shit, we're playing a game right.
[106:56.98]I've been thinking about doing that, actually.
[106:59.32]With Lords of the Fallen coming out, I was like, what if I just actually just got the lobotomy instead?
[107:05.52]I'm so dead.
[107:06.40]This is not coming back from that one.
[107:08.22]It'll be a miracle if I make it.
[107:13.32]I just died.
[107:14.96]I didn't even freeze, I just died.
[107:18.51]How do you die?
[107:19.39]Is there a secret health meter?
[107:23.96]I don't know how I stayed alive during that.
[107:25.74]What the fuck?
[107:31.14]Who made them angry?
[107:32.00]Okay, I'm going to throw you guys a bomb.
[107:35.04]Can you guys use it?
[107:36.95]Yeah.
[107:37.23]Alright, Ster.
[107:38.15]Ster, I'm going to throw it to you.
[107:41.03]Alright, that's one down.
[107:43.33]That guy's coming at me with a nunchucks though.
[107:47.48]Oh, that could be two down with the right help.
[107:52.06]I call it.
[107:52.42]I'm going to use them.
[107:59.61]I managed to sacrifice myself.
[108:03.81]Make sure he doesn't get up.
[108:05.81]Wait, what?
[108:07.85]How did we lose her?
[108:08.79]What do you mean?
[108:10.33]How do we lose this?
[108:11.43]They're all alive.
[108:14.15]All three of them were just in the water and we let them get up there?
[108:17.99]No, impossible.
[108:22.31]Almost a great fish, by the way.
[108:23.79]I was really impressed with that fish.
[108:26.97]They had the swinging chain pole wood the whole time.
[108:30.23]We got it.
[108:30.71]We got it.
[108:31.19]Get it together.
[108:39.91]Huh?
[108:42.71]This guy's that drank the... Okay.
[108:44.13]Yeah, he threw it away.
[108:45.77]What the heck?
[108:53.06]Does my duck not know how to, like, grab things?
[108:57.34]There we go.
[108:58.44]Oh, fuck.
[109:03.64]Oh, it worked!
[109:04.36]Okay.
[109:05.29]He might be dead.
[109:12.66]He's still alive?
[109:14.66]I don't know what science has to happen there for that.
[109:18.06]How?
[109:20.49]I'm getting murdered.
[109:23.89]Get up!
[109:25.97]What the heck, dude?
[109:32.19]It's so slippery.
[109:33.32]No!
[109:34.50]Help!
[109:35.36]Help!
[109:37.02]Help!
[109:57.48]Oh shit.
[109:58.72]I'm coming over to you.
[110:00.36]Yo.
[110:00.54]Let's get the gun.
[110:07.51]How am I getting one punch over?
[110:11.01]Like little baby punches.
[110:12.27]Get that racket.
[110:20.29]That bomb is... Ooh, that's a frightening bomb.
[110:22.20]That's a... Whoa!
[110:24.04]Oh, shit.
[110:27.40]Oh, boy.
[110:27.88]I might be done here.
[110:30.68]What kind of science needs to happen for that?
[110:33.02]I might be done here.
[110:33.68]I think we got it.
[110:36.11]We got it.
[110:37.21]Just be careful.
[110:40.97]Yeah.
[110:42.09]Good job.
[110:43.47]Oh, please.
[110:44.33]Please, I want to celebrate.
[110:45.47]I want to celebrate.
[110:47.11]I want to go to Pizza Hut after the game.
[110:48.91]I want to go to Pizza Hut.
[110:52.76]Final round.
[110:55.16]Fight.
[110:56.62]Heaven or hell.
[110:59.65]Stirr.
[111:03.89]Stirr, you walloped me.
[111:04.87]You walloped me, gosh darn it.
[111:05.85]You walloped me.
[111:06.21]Help me in the water!
[111:10.98]No!
[111:11.42]It's alright, we're good.
[111:12.48]I just knocked him out.
[111:14.50]I'm gonna freeze, I'm freezing!
[111:20.10]I have to at least make that worth it.
[111:22.51]This guy cannot get up.
[111:29.03]I felt like I was getting this.
[111:30.29]Jesus.
[111:32.19]I've been useless.
[111:39.06]Get.
[111:39.80]Get.
[111:40.68]Big ass bomb coming in.
[111:43.40]Boom.
[111:44.74]Oh, never mind.
[111:46.79]It fell off.
[111:59.91]Got him.
[112:01.03]Holy shit.
[112:01.57]That was beautiful, actually.
[112:04.56]Okay.
[112:07.14]2v3 scenario.
[112:08.04]Might be 2v2.
[112:08.44]2v2.
[112:08.54]2v2.
[112:08.64]2v1.
[112:08.70]Maybe.
[112:08.96]2v2.
[112:09.14]2v2.
[112:09.20]Just be careful.
[112:10.88]Oh!
[112:10.94]Oh, papa.
[112:29.48]Yeah, 1v1, 1v1.
[112:30.52]Vinny, you got it.
[112:34.06]I threw a bomb there behind him.
[112:35.40]Oh, it's going to blow.
[112:40.23]Oh.
[112:44.41]We died.
[112:45.17]I'm so sorry.
[112:45.95]Who threw that fish?
[112:50.55]The other team probably just screwed us over.
[112:52.71]That was a good one, though.
[113:00.48]They had us on the rope, but you know, the other team probably wasn't talking about, like, football.
[113:07.54]You know football started in the bathroom?
[113:18.36]Yeah, John Madden just, like, yelled into the ball.
[113:20.84]Touchdown, Patriot!
[113:24.11]You know, I think I really need some tough accidents enacted in here.
[113:30.65]That's a bit of a reference.
[113:32.15]That's an old reference.
[113:34.69]Oh yeah.
[113:36.03]Yeah.
[113:37.81]That's what the super bowl is.
[113:39.11]That's true.
[113:39.65]Yeah.
[113:40.31]The bowl.
[113:42.35]I get it.
[113:43.67]Oh, I'm getting it.
[113:44.27]Broken arrow.
[113:45.23]Broken arrow.
[113:46.67]This one tilts and you can fall off.
[113:50.02]Well, you can fall off of the plane.
[113:52.02]Yeah.
[113:52.60]Oh, can you wear sticky shoes?
[113:57.80]No.
[113:59.18]Like Tom cruise.
[114:03.58]Use tilt controls.
[114:04.56]Oh, I'm using tilt controls.
[114:06.02]That's kind of... Damn.
[114:16.23]How you guys doing?
[114:16.79]You guys doing good?
[114:18.61]Yes.
[114:20.37]Oh, babe.
[114:20.63]Trying to wipe the memory of that last round from my mind.
[114:26.09]like I would wipe in the bathroom, yeah.
[114:27.97]But otherwise I'm doing great.
[114:29.09]I'm gonna be the, uh, cow.
[114:32.13]Bull.
[114:32.37]I don't know.
[114:33.37]What is this?
[114:33.75]Is it a cow or a bull?
[114:34.47]I think it's a cow, right?
[114:42.88]I'm gonna use voice controls on this one.
[114:46.12]Okay.
[114:46.62]Probably a good idea.
[114:48.78]It's a bull, dipshit.
[114:50.84]When do you get to, um, change, like, unlock your skins from all the levels you've acquired?
[114:57.13]How about you be a little nicer when you call me a dipshit?
[115:01.49]Oh.
[115:01.61]I just want to make sure you didn't think I was answering you that way.
[115:06.37]I would have known because I didn't call you a dipshit.
[115:09.16]That's right.
[115:09.98]Oh, instantly eliminated one.
[115:17.86]Oh, a blade hit me in the head.
[115:19.66]Alright, but we traded.
[115:22.92]Oh, we're gaining.
[115:23.60]We're gaining altitude.
[115:24.48]No!
[115:25.70]That was good.
[115:29.08]That was good though.
[115:30.38]I saw what happened there.
[115:31.76]Bomb coming in.
[115:34.28]Good placement.
[115:35.48]Good placement.
[115:37.44]And we win.
[115:38.18]We did it.
[115:39.30]Oh, is this Zippy?
[115:40.98]In the pilot?
[115:48.25]This one's hard to see sometimes.
[115:49.53]Especially when it's tilted.
[115:53.61]Oh, I'll take that.
[115:54.69]No, I won't.
[115:55.93]Get this duck off me.
[115:59.51]I was trying to save you.
[116:01.69]Did he fall off?
[116:04.08]Yeah, he did.
[116:11.66]Oh, thank you.
[116:12.38]I'll take it.
[116:13.54]Oh, yup.
[116:14.60]Somebody get that.
[116:23.98]Help!
[116:24.92]I've got a bat.
[116:29.82]I'll go.
[116:30.22]I'll poke.
[116:30.70]You do it.
[116:32.85]Oh no.
[116:36.33]Oh no.
[116:38.69]I think we're okay though.
[116:40.93]I'm going to throw a bomb in there.
[116:44.75]Okay.
[116:45.39]Ster, you got Ster.
[116:47.93]We just all did the same thing.
[116:49.40]That was so embarrassing.
[116:50.90]You messed it up.
[116:51.56]You got in my way.
[116:52.34]Let me defend.
[116:54.20]I was dead that whole time.
[116:55.32]They weren't.
[116:57.90]Wait.
[116:58.30]They were.
[117:01.01]Wait.
[117:02.51]Who am I?
[117:04.17]Oh my god!
[117:04.85]Help!

[117:15.13]You just like... You just like cartoon drop that guy off the cliff.
[117:19.14]Yeah.

[117:33.97]You can't call them gorillas.
[117:36.00]He just went off.
[117:38.42]Oh.
[117:39.64]You alright?
[117:41.18]I think I'm okay, but why would you do that?
[117:44.88]I'm sorry.
[117:46.34]Don't all of us fall off at the same time.
[117:48.12]It's one person.

[119:27.11]I'll go grab my mom's card.
[119:34.81]I'm going to use my animal bucks.
[119:37.29]Here we go.
[119:41.91]Pink fighter Barbie?
[119:47.21]Vinny, did you see the Star Wars outfit for the duck?
[119:52.45]What do you mean?
[119:54.70]So, Vinny, you single?
[119:57.60]Yeah.
[119:58.22]What's up, bro?
[119:59.10]I know we're both in the diapers.
[120:00.94]Both New Jersey.
[120:02.88]Adult diaper, bro?
[120:05.30]Wait, I'm not New Jersey.
[120:06.48]I'm New York.
[120:07.38]Well, it's like the same thing.
[120:08.68]You were excited about New Jersey, and you were upset that I didn't like New Jersey.
[120:12.68]Oh, you took those as signals.
[120:15.12]Yeah, I thought you were trying to, like, relate.
[120:19.49]Not really.
[120:20.27]I mean, listen, man.
[120:21.47]I don't know if you know this.
[120:24.69]I've devoted my life to God.
[120:27.59]Oh, you said, like, I thought it was a signal when you said Wildwood.
[120:32.49]Because that could only mean one thing.
[120:34.86]That would be Wyland, though, sometimes.
[120:36.90]But no, sorry, Brady.
[120:38.12]That's a real place.
[120:40.42]Yeah, I know.
[120:41.56]But, like, why would you bring up Wildwood?
[120:43.48]Why wouldn't you say Point Pleasant?
[120:45.30]He said Wildwood.
[120:46.26]Because Point Pleasant is even more sexually suggestive.
[120:53.73]I guess yeah man I could have said Seaside heights but I guess that anything could be suggestive I suppose I don't know what what's your favorite shore town and that's not me hitting on you uh I think I'm a point pleasanter it's so small though the boardwalk well now that like the tsunamis hit it what is it even smaller now uh there was that big storm and like half of the docks went into the ocean
[121:23.94]recently like 10 15 years ago oh dog that was Seaside heights oh that was Seaside yeah they rebuilt that it's even worse now I'm a Seaside guy they have a snooki store you can buy any and all things snooki related really yeah well I would I would go to the the fudge store and buy fudge by the pound
[121:50.13]I feel you.
[121:50.85]I've done that too.
[121:51.67]Asbury Park is awesome also, but I was going to say, there's a really cool fudge store called Douglas.
[121:57.83]My mom said I'm not allowed to go to Asbury Park.
[122:01.94]It's dangerous over there.
[122:03.04]I agree.
[122:03.50]There's too many cool cats.
[122:05.20]I don't know anything about that.
[122:06.84]There's like greasers with their hair like slicked up and they're doing like, they're doing like this.
[122:11.70]Dance numbers if you come up to them.
[122:13.71]I'm back.
[122:14.45]Hey.
[122:17.41]Oh, nothing, just getting like brutally rejected live.
[122:21.53]Oh, what happened?

[122:41.90]Herman needs like the whole thing.
[122:43.15]Well, here's what I think happened.
[122:48.11]Ster was like, hey, Vinny, you're trying to, like, mack on me and shit, talking about how we're both from New York.
[122:59.07]And Vinny's like, no, actually, I'm from Jersey.
[123:02.11]And then Ster's opposite, whatever.
[123:04.25]Ster's like, well, isn't it the same thing?
[123:07.57]And then they just, I don't know.
[123:09.51]It's got really weird.
[123:11.89]Well, listen, I just want to buy you some Douglas fudge, Ster.
[123:17.09]I'll eat it.

[123:35.02]Okay, okay.
[123:36.66]I'm ready to play.
[123:37.38]You're the one who had to take, like, a toilet nap.
[123:40.48]Ster, do you like Texas?
[123:42.34]Yeah, I do.
[123:43.70]Except for the allergies.

[124:21.84]Oh, that's right.
[124:22.56]Your viewers could hear that shit too.
[124:24.28]Oh, man.
[124:27.25]Sorry, Jerma viewers.
[124:29.81]I am trying not to show my... I'm trying not to show my teeth right now, but you can tell that I'm showing my teeth when I'm talking like this.
[124:38.91]Oh, I love this one.
[124:40.13]Do you want to talk about Star Trek instead?
[124:44.31]What's your favorite episode of Star Trek?
[124:46.13]I'll go first.
[124:47.85]Okay.
[124:49.25]No, what is it?
[124:49.73]I don't know.
[124:51.53]It's probably the one with Spock.
[124:53.59]They take the brain out of his head.
[124:57.25]Oh, shit.
[124:57.99]Okay.
[124:59.23]It's considered the worst episode of Star Trek.
[125:01.81]Just being a contrarian.
[125:04.12]Can I ask you a question?
[125:05.16]Are you actually a big Star Trek fan?
[125:08.54]You are, right?
[125:09.80]I am.
[125:10.18]Also, I'm not in the party, I don't think.

[125:25.15]Go ahead, Jerm.
[125:27.25]What was that?
[125:28.65]Okay, we'll play it out.
[125:29.89]I have a lot of questions for you, Vinny.
[125:33.54]I'll take one question.
[125:37.38]Just start with your best one.
[125:39.12]Imagine all the people at the press talking to the politicians like, okay, well, let me tell you, I got a lot of questions for you.
[125:44.93]Like, well, you're going to ask one.
[125:46.85]No.
[125:47.01]No.
[125:47.83]Are we leaving?
[125:49.59]No, stay.
[125:50.00]Stay.
[125:51.48]Okay.
[125:52.08]I'm going to make short work of them.
[125:53.84]If I were to tell you, Vinny, that I liked Voyager, is that a scenario where you would punch me in the face?
[125:58.40]Not at all.
[125:58.98]Okay.
[125:59.30]No, there's some great episodes of Voyager.
[126:00.78]Some bad ones.
[126:01.72]There's an episode where Janeway and Tom Paris turn into lizards, and they have little lizard babies because they went Warp 11 or some shit.
[126:09.27]That's a bad episode, but it's an alright show.
[126:11.73]I like it.
[126:12.49]I squarely place it in the middle.
[126:15.23]This fucking duck.
[126:19.41]Yeah, I like it, but we're talking about favorite Star Trek episodes.
[126:22.57]It's the one where spoilers were talking about Voyager now.
[126:29.57]We are talking about Voyager and hold on.
[126:34.03]I have to make sure we don't lose.
[126:36.83]I'll protect you both.
[126:37.45]I don't even know what what Star Trek is.
[126:40.92]Is that like same sci-fi or?
[126:44.86]I'm just making sure nobody comes over here.
[126:47.88]Do you ever see Star Wars?
[126:50.34]Like once.
[126:50.84]Okay.
[126:51.82]It's like that.
[126:52.50]But the guy has like elf ears.
[126:55.80]Okay.
[126:57.14]So it's fantasy.
[126:59.22]Yeah.
[127:00.44]The episode in Voyager where the clones.
[127:04.20]It turns out they're clones for the whole episode.
[127:05.90]And they just have to sacrifice themselves for the real ones.
[127:08.78]Remember that one?
[127:11.76]Not really.
[127:13.67]That's a great one.
[127:16.97]Sphinx.
[127:17.63]One of my mods knows about Sphinx.
[127:19.25]Is that a good one?
[127:20.54]Oh.
[127:20.96]You remember that?
[127:22.16]Oh, what are you doing?
[127:24.00]Oh.
[127:25.64]Oh, wait.
[127:26.50]Hold on.
[127:26.94]Let's talk.
[127:27.40]No.
[127:32.12]I can't do anything about this.
[127:38.35]It's called demon.
[127:39.51]Wow.
[127:39.81]I want to see how far I can go with it.
[127:44.27]That's for not inviting Vinny.
[127:48.50]I deserved it.
[127:51.28]For not inviting me, you have to hear me talk about Star Trek.
[127:53.92]So I guess it evens out somewhere along the way.
[127:59.24]Okay, Vinny.
[128:00.34]Vinny, who is this?
[128:02.87]I'm going to say one sentence.
[128:05.17]Okay.
[128:06.89]Captain, I just made the most scrumptious cake.
[128:11.63]Thank God.
[128:12.95]Is that guy's blood white?

[129:05.91]I just quit the game.
[129:07.37]I just pressed Alt and Force fast like I could.
[129:10.43]Are you serious?
[129:11.23]No.
[129:13.43]I was thinking about it.
[129:16.54]You definitely hit a bong during that break.
[129:22.18]I'm over 21.
[129:23.16]It's legal in fucking Nevada.
[129:25.30]What are you?
[129:25.60]What?
[129:25.72]You got a problem?
[129:27.36]Yeah, you got a problem in chat?
[129:29.52]Somebody's a problem here?
[129:31.50]Problem in chat.
[129:38.48]Whose chat are you reading?
[129:39.53]I'm reading mine.
[129:41.45]They're telling me they're like, hey, dude.
[129:49.88]We're actually gonna win.
[129:52.14]Yeah, this is a lot easier without Vinny.
[129:53.84]I threw myself off.
[129:57.18]Hey, just got back.
[129:58.45]Hope everyone was talking nice about me.
[130:01.17]We need you.
[130:02.45]We need you now.
[130:02.91]The vibes are off.
[130:03.89]More than ever.
[130:04.43]Alright.
[130:08.57]Since you left, Jerma got high.
[130:10.62]Um...

[130:16.26]Shit.
[130:16.40]Alright, I'll... I suppose I'll join back in.
[130:21.27]But you may ask me only one question, Waiku.
[130:27.65]Yeah, did you ever... Oh, you asked him what his favorite episode was, and he gave you a joke answer.
[130:33.34]He only likes Star Trek, ironically.
[130:35.48]My real answer... I'm dead?
[130:40.06]That's my real answer.
[130:41.73]My face is just burning with cold.
[130:47.35]Measure of a man or tapestry?
[130:50.05]Those are my answers.
[130:51.59]Some of you will know what those are.
[130:53.97]What's that?
[130:58.23]Can I ask you guys something?
[131:01.05]Yeah, just one.

[131:56.75]Sorry, I blacked out for a second.
[131:58.11]What did you guys say?
[132:00.31]I'm going to send an invite.
[132:01.15]Who needs an invite?
[132:02.89]Oh, Vinny.
[132:03.69]Me.
[132:08.61]Okay.
[132:10.88]Okay.
[132:13.52]Let's go ahead.
[132:17.46]Invite to team.
[132:18.14]Invite to team.
[132:18.74]Okay.
[132:20.60]Thank you, Frosty Flakes.
[132:21.78]You are very welcome.
[132:23.99]so which one of these animals do you actually identify with most like if you had to have an animal to represent yourself uh I'll go first I'm wondering which one Jerma's gonna pick I you're gonna go first yeah my first my mine was to pass to you oh you're passing to me
[132:46.60]Yeah, and there's only one pass.
[132:47.58]You can't do consecutive passes.
[132:49.06]The rules are one pass, and then you can't do a pass again.
[132:52.30]So then, but if one gets picked, we both can't pick the same one.
[132:55.32]So that's the point of passing is to... I don't get it.
[133:01.73]You wouldn't get it.
[133:02.39]Okay, well, we're going to do Lollipop Factory.
[133:06.39]This one is you have to collect the most candies and dump them into your big hole thing, whatever it is.
[133:13.35]I think I'd be a squirrel.
[133:15.25]Squirrel's not in this game.
[133:18.10]just animal in general like what animal are you you know how like animals have personality traits and people are like lions are tough and pandas are hungry and sleepy but animals have one personality trait maybe two if they're lucky and humans have a wide range okay no but like the the animal that most defines you
[133:44.46]Could no one do one?
[133:46.30]We did the Star Trek episode, we did the football, and I'm like, hey guys, what animal?
[133:53.71]Well, that takes a long time to think about.
[133:56.31]I know what my favorite... I know my favorite Star Trek episode.
[134:00.49]Yeah, but that's a big loaded question because a lot goes into that.
[134:05.11]It's not just like, I like when Data goes, Captain.
[134:08.07]That's very easy.
[134:11.92]I think I would be
[134:15.84]You're a red.
[134:17.24]No, no.
[134:18.68]Don't look at my chap.
[134:23.42]What is this?
[134:26.93]Yeah, we gotta collect.
[134:28.47]Get the big candy.
[134:29.63]Get the big candy.
[134:30.37]Yeah, the big candy is worth a lot and it takes two people to drag it around.
[134:33.15]Gotta take it upstairs.
[134:37.81]You guys get that.
[134:39.44]Go defend.
[134:43.12]He really hit you, bro.
[134:43.76]Chino just knocked me the fuck out.
[134:46.78]Knocked his ass out.
[134:47.66]Alright.
[134:47.86]Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
[134:48.50]I'm going to pull the switch.
[134:49.14]Pull the switch.
[134:49.96]Go on, go on, go on.
[134:53.06]There it is.
[134:53.42]Oh.
[134:56.28]Lollipop.
[134:58.44]Yo, I double handed these.
[134:59.69]I'm dual wielding.
[135:01.99]Jerem, I might have just like knocked you out.
[135:04.83]Sorry about that.
[135:06.67]It's the nature of the game.
[135:07.47]It's all good.
[135:11.90]I don't know.
[135:12.80]I'm going to kind of throw out this from left field here.
[135:14.78]I think it would be some kind of bug.
[135:18.42]That's not from left field.
[135:21.03]A bug.
[135:22.11]Help me take the big candy.
[135:23.29]The big candy.
[135:24.29]I'm coming up with a weapon.
[135:28.49]How many points do I count for?
[135:30.08]That's me.
[135:33.58]I'm trying to be a pain in the ass right now.
[135:46.16]Did they get it?
[135:49.52]Oh, shoot.
[135:50.92]Pull the switch.
[135:52.98]Pull it.
[135:54.42]Big candy.
[135:55.52]Big candy.
[135:55.90]Alright.
[135:56.62]Let's get it.
[135:56.94]Doing double time here.
[136:02.28]Good.
[136:04.87]You go first.
[136:05.35]Okay.
[136:08.29]This guy's... Alright.
[136:09.73]You just drag it.
[136:10.21]Uh-oh.
[136:12.11]Oh, shit.
[136:13.37]No, no, no.
[136:13.83]We got it.
[136:14.23]We got it.
[136:14.61]We got it.
[136:16.80]Oh, that's a lot.
[136:20.16]We're almost there.
[136:20.66]We need a couple of little gumdrops or something.
[136:29.72]Oh, okay.
[136:30.46]Here's a question.
[136:31.51]A good icebreaker question.
[136:32.91]Favorite candy?
[136:35.79]Hmm.
[136:36.93]That changes.
[136:39.25]The strips one.
[136:39.75]You know what I'm talking about?
[136:40.53]The strips of color.
[136:42.79]Sour strips?
[136:43.79]Sour belts.
[136:46.09]Cellar belts?
[136:47.19]Strips?
[136:47.67]That sounds like an old man.
[136:50.21]Like, you guys ever heard of these strips?
[136:52.21]Candy strips?
[136:54.52]They're right next to the cigarettes.
[136:56.62]It's called gay bacon.
[136:58.78]Gay bacon?
[136:59.72]You know what I'm talking about?
[137:02.70]I've never heard of this.
[137:03.86]I'll find a picture right now.
[137:13.99]Oh my god, they just beat the shit out of my poor dog.
[137:17.31]Look, it's on Discord.
[137:18.87]Let's see.
[137:21.97]Ooh.
[137:23.11]You've never seen those?
[137:24.01]Andy, revenge.
[137:26.91]Sour Belts.
[137:28.19]Oh, I have seen these.
[137:28.89]I've never had them, though.
[137:30.31]They're good.
[137:32.30]What's the flavor profile?
[137:33.46]What can you compare it to?
[137:35.56]It's just sour.
[137:37.58]A lot of flavors on the tongue type shit.
[137:41.48]I mean, where else would you put it?
[137:51.56]It's necessary to differentiate.
[137:54.30]Are we good?
[137:56.12]Play again?
[137:57.00]I'm good.
[137:57.38]I'm good.
[137:57.60]I was just reminded that I would be an angler fish.
[138:01.69]Anyway, what's your favorite?
[138:05.87]My favorite candy is probably I'm going to do a thing and I want you guys to guess.
[138:14.30]I think I left the party.
[138:17.10]Yeah, thank you.

[139:45.04]I'm apparently I can't do anything for two minutes.
[139:48.05]child tastes so when you try to say child taste no oh your favorite candy is and it's like oh that's for children like what candy isn't for children what's an adult candy that person has not had a s'more in a very long time and I get it because it's like a meme like oh yeah campfire go make one go make one in the refined taste of dung chocolate what he just said raisins that is a pretty adult candy
[140:15.24]Give you that one.
[140:16.46]Okay.
[140:17.68]Actually, it's funny.
[140:18.70]One of the things I've been doing recently is, like, I got candy from, like, Canada.
[140:23.46]I just did one with a package that someone sent from France.
[140:27.01]And there was some stuff in there that was, like, god awful.
[140:30.33]Like, there is this, like, it tastes like oil.
[140:34.21]Like, crude oil.
[140:35.03]Oh, my God.
[140:37.53]Yeah, it was Canada?
[140:39.92]From France.
[140:41.16]How was the Canada ones, though?
[140:43.19]good I mean a lot of it was like ketchup chips and the usual like all dressed uh chocolate was good I feel like Canada has better chocolate than America it's true and France the ones I got were from a town near Switzerland was the best it was one of the best chocolate bars I've ever had oh that's the swiss chocolate of course you're speaking I miss the wonka bars what the hell
[141:06.58]They bought that Wonka company and obliterated every brand besides Nerds.
[141:11.97]It's like, come on.
[141:12.59]I just watched a video on that, and yeah, yeah.
[141:15.23]That stuff was good.
[141:17.52]Every Wonka line of candy, they were just like, nah, nah, throw all of it away except for Nerds.
[141:23.08]What are they thinking?
[141:24.37]Nerds was so good, though, growing up.
[141:26.70]They were.
[141:27.24]They were.
[141:27.96]Now, as a man of a certain age, it's a little tougher.
[141:33.41]I can be invited.
[141:34.51]Somebody want to invite me?
[141:35.79]I'm doing it.
[141:36.39]I'm doing it.
[141:36.91]I'm doing it.

[141:42.39]Since you started talking about it, I haven't been able to stop eating them.

[142:11.36]Yeah, that's good stuff.
[142:12.58]It doesn't have to be on them.
[142:13.78]It could be near them.
[142:14.95]It could be combined with the caramel.
[142:17.65]Anywhere is good.

[143:17.64]You eat Tums in a fucking bowl of cereal for breakfast.
[143:21.04]I ain't hearing any more of your food opinion.
[143:23.39]How is, like, popcorn any different than Tums, really?
[143:26.79]You know, popcorn used to be a cereal.
[143:28.97]Same thing.
[143:31.69]Have you ever had popcorn in milk?
[143:33.01]Is that gross to you, too?
[143:33.87]Because it's like, oh, it's not, like, modern.
[143:35.21]It would be, like, unsocial.
[143:37.97]You sound like Lorne Michaels from SNL.
[143:40.78]You know, it would be, like, modern.
[143:42.92]Get the popcorn in the milk.
[143:46.24]I don't know.
[143:47.06]I read what we're doing.
[143:48.26]Guys, we're losing.
[143:50.16]Where am I?
[143:52.32]What is happening?
[143:53.18]My God, what is happening?
[143:56.08]Where am I?
[143:57.30]They killed me, man.
[143:59.10]I got to put the YouTuber voice away for a few minutes.
[144:01.08]Hold on.
[144:04.74]Oh, my God.
[144:06.00]What is going on?
[144:08.84]My favorite candy is probably French toast.
[144:13.41]French toast?
[144:14.09]I'm struggling here.
[144:16.52]I mean, it's sweet.
[144:17.92]I'd give you that much.
[144:18.60]I mean, y'all are going to bring out popcorn and then talk shit about me.
[144:21.96]We said snacks.
[144:23.32]I said snacks.
[144:24.62]Okay, well, then you changed the topic.
[144:26.46]I did change it.
[144:27.20]I did change it.
[144:28.22]What is your favorite snack?
[144:30.11]Yes, he did, actually.
[144:31.21]Yeah, he sounded very excited for the topic change, too.
[144:34.07]Mine's French toast.
[144:37.64]Sir, how long did it take you to start saying y'all when moving from New Jersey to Texas?
[144:42.70]Real question, serious.
[144:43.94]No one says it in Austin because Austin is fake Texas.
[144:46.54]There's a couple people that do, and every time they do, it makes me happy.
[144:50.40]And I'm like, you're one of the real ones.
[144:52.94]Oh, you guys worked together on that, sir.
[144:57.74]Well, I saved you.
[145:01.09]What's the goal?
[145:02.21]We're just hanging with this guy.
[145:03.75]We got to move this over.
[145:04.91]There's a big balloon we have to move into their area over there.
[145:08.42]Jump and punch this guy.
[145:09.20]Jump and punch him.
[145:10.58]Jeremy, you practiced earlier.
[145:11.68]Jump and punch him.
[145:12.98]I got him.
[145:13.62]I got him.
[145:13.88]Ready?
[145:14.80]Yep.
[145:16.12]I'm not ready.
[145:16.82]I mean, I got him, but it didn't hit him.
[145:20.20]I hit him.
[145:20.74]They're teaming up on me.
[145:23.60]They're weighing it down.
[145:24.50]They're teaming up on me.
[145:25.64]Oh, my.
[145:27.36]They're going to pull it all the way down.
[145:33.52]Alright, they can score it over here.
[145:42.70]If they get it in there, don't let them get it in.
[145:45.94]Wait, is this where we're supposed to get it?
[145:47.91]Not here, right?
[145:49.03]If they get it in here, it's a point for them.
[145:51.51]Okay.
[145:56.19]Oh, they got it.
[145:56.91]Okay, we're good.

[149:46.01]The NDA was signed as soon as you signed your check.
[149:52.83]I don't know man if somebody serves me a steak with a slice of American cheese on it when I ordered a cheese steak I'm gonna look I'm gonna be like I'm on camera right now well I didn't want to make a scene you know no way I'm dead I didn't want to like I didn't want to I I want to know what the conversation was when they went back to the chef in the back and they said cheesesteak and the chef also didn't get it and this was where in New York you said yeah

[150:36.88]I know!
[150:38.04]You go to New York, get a cheesesteak?
[150:41.04]You can, if you want.
[150:42.04]It's not as good, but it's alright.
[150:43.36]I'm getting bullied over here.
[150:45.08]Oh, sorry.
[150:45.60]You're bullying me.

[150:54.83]The monkey, I'm killing.
[150:57.15]Oh, I'm so far away.
[150:58.19]I'm so far away.
[151:00.69]In New York, it's called a chopped cheese.
[151:02.67]Is that real?
[151:03.77]That's another thing entirely.
[151:05.53]That's basically like chopped meat.
[151:07.99]And they like chop up banana peppers and other toppings and, you know, stuff.
[151:13.17]And it's all like crumbly meat in like a bun on like a roll.
[151:17.87]And they put it over the top of like a well-done steak.
[151:22.17]No, no, no, no, no, not at all.
[151:25.19]No, it's just all burger ingredients and some extra stuff chopped up and then put on a roll.
[151:30.76]It's good.
[151:32.80]Anyone here singing?
[151:33.54]Yeah, I hear a seal going.
[151:36.36]I kind of dig it.
[151:42.68]Oh, somebody fell.

[152:15.99]The monkey is going crazy on me.
[152:17.55]Do you want to win?
[152:19.75]Do you?
[152:22.49]I feel like you're not even trying.
[152:24.01]I just eliminated like two people.
[152:25.95]Oh, I see how it is.
[152:30.25]No.

[153:06.88]Really?
[153:18.76]Did anybody hit anyone?
[153:20.89]Why are we all so bad at this?
[153:22.87]Whenever I'm on this map, I can't hit anyone.
[153:32.44]Hey, we did it.
[153:36.56]We won.
[153:36.88]Got it.
[153:37.58]You know what I'm really into?
[153:40.52]I don't know how to describe it.
[153:43.51]We have a breakfast and it has like 40 different foods in it.
[153:48.03]Is that like the continental continental breakfast?
[153:50.47]Yes, sir.
[153:51.97]I like that, too.
[153:52.73]We're calling it.
[153:54.07]I don't know, but I just I like the smorgasbord of it.
[153:57.37]Okay.
[153:58.69]Fresh donut or fresh waffle?
[154:02.19]Fresh donut.
[154:02.85]Hard mode.

[154:43.77]And I died.
[154:44.67]Not him.
[154:45.27]I can't grab the record.
[154:47.09]He was in longer.
[154:52.06]Also, Ster that breakfast thing.
[154:53.78]That's why I love, like, hotel breakfast so much.
[154:56.40]That's, like, my favorite part of a hotel is the free breakfast in the morning.
[155:01.76]Apparently, there's a hotel near here, and I can just walk in, and it's free breakfast, and the homeless people do it, and I can do it.
[155:07.49]I literally said that on my stream like a couple weeks ago about like what's stopping me from walking into hotels and just getting the free breakfast.
[155:14.33]I think I'm going to do it.
[155:16.93]I've been making it lately, though.
[155:18.19]I like I am.
[155:20.18]I've been making breakfast leaves.
[155:21.80]I've been doing bacon.
[155:22.84]I get like a blueberry muffin from somewhere.
[155:25.92]I do hash browns.
[155:27.94]I put some eggs in it.
[155:30.97]So do you have like you got two or three pans like flip flip flip.
[155:35.33]Not you're cooking the eggs with the hash browns towards the end.
[155:39.60]Damn tech.
[155:41.12]Yeah, tech.
[155:43.18]But yeah, two pans.
[155:45.90]I got I got some maple sausage in the fridge.
[155:47.94]Haven't tried yet.
[155:48.60]I'm I am ready for breakfast.
[155:51.67]Oh, it's going to be 2B1 here.
[155:55.15]If I don't, can I not get up here?
[156:01.14]I'm just trying to get some W takes in here that I enjoy breakfast.
[156:03.67]That's a win.
[156:04.15]That's a win for me.
[156:05.49]That's a win.
[156:05.81]That's a win.
[156:06.57]That's a win.
[156:09.09]We got it.
[156:16.65]Guys, that's a lot of Party Animals for me.
[156:20.31]Yeah.
[156:21.21]I was going to say, I feel pretty partied out.
[156:23.03]Are you guys partied out?
[156:23.99]I am partied out.
[156:27.33]Come on, bro.
[156:28.31]We got pretty good at the game, though.
[156:29.59]I mean, we won a lot of matches, especially that ice one.
[156:32.87]Yeah.
[156:33.64]It looks like that goose is twerking.
[156:36.02]That was really fun.
[156:37.60]I had a lot of fun, guys.
[156:39.30]Yeah, Poke, thanks for literally was like, hey, you want to play?
[156:42.62]That was like, it felt like that was like 30 seconds ago.
[156:44.95]Well, I'm always down.
[156:48.63]If you guys are playing a new game, I'm down too.
[156:50.39]Is there something else you guys would rather do?
[156:54.50]I was just going to switch over to F-Zero 99.
[156:57.79]Trampoline Park.
[157:00.97]I wish I had F-Zero set up here.
[157:03.17]I got a new setup.
[157:03.79]It's not my Switch's setup.
[157:07.65]But yeah, I'm just going to go do my thing.
[157:09.53]But, Poke, I'm going to let you know about VRChat stuff.
[157:13.61]Yeah, let's do that for sure.
[157:16.63]We talked about potentially doing Darktide in the future, now that it's been patched.
[157:22.55]uh yeah whatever you want to do it message me I already played a little bit so any good familiar yeah it's good it's the same old dark tide with some interesting new stuff I feel like I've talked about dark tide with a lot of people recently I think there's a big group that would want to play it if uh whatever is happening cool alright guys um really nice gaming with you thank you for inviting me Jerma I hope to uh game more in the future thank you thanks for hanging out uh alright
[157:52.34]uh any anybody want to do something else oh that's that's on Steam that is easily downloadable The Long Drive crab game's a pretty good one if you guys wanted to look into that just saying it's free I think uh but yeah I'm gonna get going now listen I just want you to know there's a lot of games that originated in the bathroom and started with a toilet alright I'm gonna give you a list of those games in order an artist
[158:22.93]I think he left.
[158:24.19]He left.
[158:25.45]And it cut him off.
[158:26.67]Alright.
[158:29.92]So what do you want to do?
[158:31.72]Breakfast.
[158:32.16]Everyone left.
[158:32.66]I don't know.
[158:34.00]I could play more.
[158:34.76]I've already been streaming for a while before we started.
[158:38.10]So I could also just not do more.
[158:39.84]Okay.
[158:41.50]Well, why don't you want to set another day?
[158:44.93]I don't know, like after TwitchCon or before TwitchCon to do something as a group or something?
[158:52.44]Well, I think you would love Long Drive, and we should be there for that.
[158:56.75]We could do multiplayer.
[158:58.01]So multiplayer is new to me for Long Drive.
[159:00.85]Oh, you played it before?
[159:01.75]I played the original one.
[159:04.17]Yeah, it works, but it's like if you're not the host, it's kind of buggy, so we'll just deal with it, I think.
[159:09.81]You know what I mean?
[159:11.07]But it'd be really fun.
[159:12.41]Is it two-player, or is it more than two?
[159:14.51]More than two.
[159:16.21]It's really chaotic.
[159:17.43]It might break a bunch of times.
[159:20.53]Oh, well.
[159:23.11]How does it- how does it- how does it- we just- I think I have it installed?
[159:25.11]I think- I think you just drive, right? You just drive.
[159:29.11]It might be getting an update though soon so waiting might be the play too.
[159:33.11]Wait how quickly do you think that will come out?
[159:36.11]I would say probably in the next month... if I'm not surprised.
[159:42.11]Okay, do you- do you guys want to wait for the good patch and then just get on it and just I have to have absolute mayhem?
[159:52.53]Uhm yes. Also did you see the uh Binding of Isaac co-op patch?
[159:57.53]I heard about it.
[159:58.53]There's Binding of Isaac co-op?
[159:59.53]Yeah there's a co-op patch and I saw like a the dev he posted a TikTok today it was like uh showing you- it looks really good.
[160:07.53]Looks really good man, that'd be fun.
[160:12.53]Poke what was that- I feel like you said there was something else that was worth playing.
[160:17.00]Um, the duck game?
[160:20.75]Yeah, I played the duck game.
[160:23.11]Let me see.
[160:24.45]Let me look at my Steam.
[160:25.33]Because I would want to play Long Drive, but I would want to play Long Drive for more than like 20 minutes before it crashed and we have to get it all messed up.
[160:36.17]7 days to die, but it's very slow.
[160:38.09]I don't know.
[160:41.83]There's a bunch of fun stuff we could do.
[160:44.49]We should do like a day of classics, like a Duck Game, you know what I mean?
[160:48.83]I would do- yeah that sounds fun.
[160:51.00]Just like uh go through like a round, get like uh four people again. Get Vinny. Do like uh-
[160:57.00]I'm down for anything but it sounds like we need time - that we're not smart enough to like to come up with something right.
[161:02.00]No, yeah, that's alright I mean we've been playing for like three hours that's- that's a long time.
[161:07.00]We can just pivot to whatever. Ster I think you said you might be ending anyways, right?
[161:11.00]Maybe. I mean it depends if something else is going on, like if you want to if you wanted to bring me along.
[161:17.46]Yeah, I don't really... Nothing that's really easy to get into right this moment.
[161:18.00]Oh yeah, I know.
[161:22.28]Let's see.
[161:24.04]What do we got?
[161:27.46]What can we play?
