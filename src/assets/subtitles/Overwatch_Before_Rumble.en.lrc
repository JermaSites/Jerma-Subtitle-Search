[00:51.45]I told, I knew, you guys knew I was alive.
[00:53.57]I've been around.
[01:00.79]Sometimes I forget that taking, if you take like, if you don't like hear from somebody in four days online, or like five days on the internet, they're gone forever.
[01:12.20]Forgot about that.
[01:16.49]I didn't even like tweet this stream.
[01:17.75]This is going to be like, I don't even want to.
[01:20.42]This is going to be one of those streams that I stream for like an hour or two.
[01:24.19]Just taking a break.
[01:30.71]Eating contest.
[01:33.83]Let me get this in the right place.
[01:36.83]And we can go.

[01:53.69]It's going good.

[01:59.64]It's a disaster, but it's like the best possible disaster you possibly could watch.
[02:04.80]Zimu, thanks a lot, Zimu, for three months.

[03:29.15]And LMK50, thank you for actually just subscribing.
[03:35.29]SickScreamStream.
[03:37.29]Let's talk about those drunk tweets.
[03:39.97]What's there to talk about?
[03:41.95]Sometimes, look, I'm only human, guys.
[03:44.61]I'm a human being.
[03:45.99]I know sometimes it's hard to realize.
[03:48.12]Wait, what?
[03:49.44]But I am a person.
[03:51.72]And sometimes, sometimes you just pissed off.
[03:54.26]And you just, you vent.
[03:56.18]That was me venting.
[03:56.95]I don't do it often.
[04:06.15]Oh my god, we got like 10 monthers coming in now.
[04:12.90]Thank you LMK50, I think I said that already, but welcome.
[04:16.52]Oh my god.
[04:17.60]That's a 10 month subscription.
[04:19.02]10 months?! !
[04:23.90]Seven months from SFM James.
[04:25.86]Holy shit.
[04:28.43]This guy... Remember when this guy was a streamer?
[04:31.17]And I don't worry.
[04:31.71]I will be again.
[04:33.93]I... Oh, there's one thing I'm gonna... I'm gonna promise you guys one thing.
[04:36.49]Ready?
[04:37.37]Here's me promising you one thing.
[04:40.39]Promising you one thing.
[04:42.85]The thing that you're gonna watch, like, next week... Will at least probably make you, like, chuckle.
[04:48.67]And if it doesn't, then my... Then I... Then I failed my job.
[04:53.22]At least it's making me laugh, but I think that's all that matters, right?
[04:57.68]As long as it's making me happy and me laugh.
[05:01.76]I don't know why I'm playing Zarya right now.
[05:03.46]Don't ask me.
[05:05.46]But I am.
[05:07.68]I am playing Zarya.
[05:10.44]And I'm burning this guy.
[05:15.70]Okay.
[05:15.84]I don't think I'm going to be playing any competitive.
[05:20.59]I don't think I'm going to handle that right now.
[05:23.49]I'm supposed to be taking a break, not like getting even more angry, you know?
[05:28.51]Not that I was angry.
[05:29.25]That would have been awesome if I killed her with that.
[05:32.73]Yeah, the video's gonna go up next week.
[05:35.06]It should be done by next week.
[05:41.26]At least I hope so.
[05:47.52]Come here, you.
[05:50.04]Yes, this is that project I was talking about like two months ago.
[05:56.10]Whoa, where is she?
[05:59.92]Oh, well.
[06:02.82]Happy birthday from Nintendo, Lizard.
[06:05.18]Happy birthday?
[06:05.75]It's not my birthday.
[06:14.13]That means two to three weeks?
[06:15.41]No.
[06:16.95]If it takes like three more weeks for this video to go up, then it is a catastrophic disaster.
[06:24.52]It'll be alright.
[06:25.28]It'll be there.
[06:30.48]Where the hell is he?
[06:32.06]I want a Toggle Steam, but I don't think I have an opportunity.
[06:34.10]There's nobody here.
[06:35.49]I can't really push back this far.
[06:41.51]Congrats on hitting the big 30.
[06:44.05]I've been 30 for almost a year.
[06:45.27]Oh, it's Ronnie.
[06:47.59]Come on, Ronnie.
[06:49.27]Ronnie, remember me?
[06:50.99]Ronnie, do you remember me?
[06:54.35]Oh, here we go.
[06:59.28]Oh, you had to do the Irish, didn't you?
[07:00.92]I had like a hundred.
[07:01.78]That would have been such a play of the century.
[07:07.04]Too bad.
[07:08.46]Wait, what?
[07:13.29]Damn it.
[07:13.73]You have to have that thing on you.
[07:20.25]Happy B-Day?
[07:26.83]I'm not 31 yet.
[07:34.12]You're losing subs, buddy?
[07:37.52]What do you want me to tell you?
[07:41.64]I mean, I did say in that video I made a couple months ago that I was going to be busy for a while.
[07:48.58]So if people want to just leave, I can't stop anybody from doing that.
[07:54.83]What do you want me to say?
[08:00.15]You want me to have a crying little cry potty?
[08:04.43]I'm taking the channel in a little different direction.
[08:07.88]That's just what happens, I guess.
[08:09.14]Whatever.
[08:11.99]hemorrhaging subs.
[08:12.95]Not really.
[08:13.57]I mean, I lost like 50,000 subscribers like a few weeks ago because of, uh, YouTube did this thing where they like just deleted them, I guess.
[08:23.01]I don't know.
[08:23.39]I guess they were inactive accounts, but yes, I did lose like 50,000 subscribers.
[08:31.17]That is crazy.
[08:37.69]Whoa.
[08:38.95]Whoa.
[08:40.71]But Cheese Fist, welcome Cheese Fist.
[08:52.29]I mean, I thought, I think I've, I don't know, obviously it's hard to, it's hard to let everybody know what you're doing.
[09:04.11]Because let's be real here, right?
[09:05.67]No!
[09:08.11]I'm going to be very, very, very real.
[09:10.45]You want to hear like reality?
[09:11.69]Like super real Jerma right now?
[09:14.97]Lucratius, thanks for six months.
[09:16.35]Ten years since a Jerma stream.
[09:18.10]It really has been a long time.
[09:19.56]Anyways.
[09:22.30]I could say as many times as I want that I was taking a break and...
[09:28.24]I've been working on something.
[09:30.21]There's going to be a big video coming out here in the next week.
[09:33.69]It doesn't matter how many times I say that.
[09:35.09]There's always going to be a bunch of people that never hear you say it.
[09:38.26]So, I'll get tweets.
[09:41.54]I'll get messages.
[09:43.10]People being like, where'd you go?
[09:46.28]Where are you?
[09:47.84]I'm just like, I've said it a bunch of times.
[09:50.52]And I don't know how many more times I have to say that I was on a break.
[09:53.02]That I was working on a project.
[09:55.36]There's always people that just didn't even know.
[09:58.16]Had no idea.
[09:59.28]And just think I'm a bad guy.
[10:01.16]But I can't help that.
[10:02.24]How am I supposed to help that?
[10:06.68]There's always going to be somebody that's angry with you.
[10:10.02]I've come to accept that.
[10:18.93]Why am I still playing Zarya?
[10:19.71]I don't know.
[10:23.21]Put it as a stream title when you're offline.
[10:25.09]Well, it's not necessarily streaming.
[10:27.37]Just kind of in general.
[10:29.03]My, like, internet presence in general.
[10:40.41]Hugs?
[10:40.83]Hey, what's up, Meep?
[10:41.61]Thanks, Meep.
[10:44.31]Wow, I just killed myself.
[10:46.53]R.I.P.
[10:50.10]Thank you.
[10:51.86]I got Lucratius, I think.
[10:52.86]All you guys for six months.
[10:54.48]That's a triple six-monther, guys.
[10:59.12]I guess I'm doing work as Zarya.
[11:01.72]I guess.
[11:09.93]Wait, what?
[11:11.87]I need somebody to do this to me.
[11:14.11]Can we have a big video, Jerma?
[11:16.65]Uh, not paying attention, I'm reading.
[11:18.55]Let's read.
[11:19.37]Can we have a big video, Jerma?
[11:20.15]You always put me in tears.
[11:21.86]I hope people think this is funny.
[11:23.82]Like, I've been very scared about this video.
[11:27.08]Not because I don't think it's very good.
[11:28.52]Like, I think it is good.
[11:30.70]But because I'm scared that people are going to be like, I waited this long for this piece of shit.
[11:40.75]Hey Marajute.
[11:41.53]I don't know if that's how you pronounce it, but welcome.
[11:43.45]Oh, there's another one.

[11:51.71]Thank you, Dr. Manhattan.

[12:04.49]Thanks a lot.
[12:07.19]But that, I... This video... There's one thing this video... I wanted to prove that I could, like, actually make this video.
[12:13.77]Like, to myself, pretty much.
[12:17.41]And it's... It has been making me laugh quite a bit.
[12:21.53]How many people are down here, please?
[12:30.43]Okay.
[12:31.46]Is that how we get in?
[12:41.82]Give us a carefully selected hint Alright, you want to hit the people that are here right now I can't even know how many people are here right now the one hint.
[12:49.50]I'm going to give you It's not even a hint but like it this video that comes out is
[13:00.63]is like something that I've already talked about.
[13:08.38]Something I've already talked about.
[13:09.82]I don't mean I could have talked about it a year ago.
[13:12.31]I could have talked about it like five years ago.
[13:15.13]Not that long.
[13:16.77]But I have already talked about, like, hey, like this!
[13:20.70]It's just... It's just this particular thing to the extreme.
[13:29.95]That's what it is.
[13:32.31]Alright, there you go.
[13:33.19]There's your one hint.
[13:41.64]clown car video.
[13:44.20]It may as well be.
[13:46.02]It may as well be.
[13:49.34]Oh, that triple stun.
[13:50.28]Who's on it?
[13:53.72]I don't even need my ult.
[14:04.36]I don't even need my ult.

[14:23.38]Thanks a lot, dude.
[14:27.80]No, actually, here's something I will say.
[14:29.96]It has nothing to do with the book.
[14:33.96]Wow.
[14:35.56]What happened?
[14:36.10]Okay, I wasn't even paying attention to how much time was left.
[14:40.29]I kind of just right-clicked it.
[14:49.06]I'm kind of just right-clicking on random people.
[14:51.88]I wasn't even looking at how much percentage there was.
[14:54.54]Wait, what?
[15:12.05]Wait, what?
[15:15.57]Alright, let's take a look.
[15:16.19]Jiggly ribs for two months.

[15:18.15]Oh, it came by.
[15:18.93]It went by too fast.
[15:28.06]And then I went right back down.
[15:29.88]Alright, a kissy for you.
[15:31.18]Hey, it's you.
[15:34.28]I don't know why.

[16:22.09]Several videos ago, I was promised kissy faces, but I never got from you.
[16:26.55]I can expect you to buy kissy faces.
[16:30.69]Okay, I'm just going to play Winston.
[16:32.21]I can turn my brain off and play Winston and just talk to chat.
[16:34.49]Wait, what?
[16:36.46]I think this is my last one.
[16:37.56]Much love.
[16:39.22]Well, thanks a lot, Red Ranger.
[16:44.49]Wait, what?
[16:47.85]I told you guys this was going to be a lot of... Dude, 155 people resubscribed while I was not streaming for a few weeks.
[16:53.73]Shitload of them.
[16:58.22]I was afraid I was going to have to celebrate my five and six month without you.
[17:02.58]Oh, goodness.
[17:03.12]I'm sorry.
[17:04.06]Thanks for five anyways.
[17:04.98]Wait, what?
[17:06.84]Oh my god, Dango Slapper for six months, I Love Donuts for six months, Antidote B for seven months, holy shit.
[17:14.48]Wait, what?
[17:16.96]You're the man, keep up what you're doing.
[17:23.73]Let's go.
[17:27.81]Who gives a fuck, it's casual Q. Who gives a fuck, it's casual Q. Who gives a fuck, it's casual Q. I'm fine, fuck.
[17:37.43]Dude, there's so many people... I can't wait for the Jerma pisses into his own face video.
[17:42.07]So many people think this video is just like a joke.
[17:45.66]Like me, like just, hey, I'm working on this big video.
[17:48.24]And then guess what?
[17:49.36]It's me waving at the camera for 10 seconds.
[17:52.64]Holy shit.
[17:55.07]How betrayed would everybody be?
[17:56.67]It's like, where the fuck have I been?
[18:08.84]Holy shit, who gives a fuck?
[18:11.02]It's casual Q. What?
[18:19.39]Alright.
[18:22.99]Took a month to get the wave just right.
[18:28.88]I wish I could just say what it was.
[18:30.60]And it's like so close that it would be so dumb if I just said what it was.
[18:37.89]I so badly just want to say it right now.
[18:40.27]And then you guys could just like, how many people?
[18:41.93]There's only like 700 people here, right?
[18:44.43]There's not like a bunch of people here.
[18:46.01]I could probably just say it.
[18:49.86]But then that would just ruin the surprise.
[18:51.66]Whoa.
[18:52.98]Did I just get stunned in the air?
[19:00.46]Oh shit, that's Ronnie right there.
[19:01.74]Ronnie, how'd you get in here?
[19:03.70]I'm stuck in the wall.
[19:11.45]Who gives a fuck?
[19:12.21]Who gives a fuck?
[19:12.97]Who gives a fuck?
[19:14.57]Oh, what's that?
[19:15.01]Oh, do you think who gives a fuck?
[19:16.67]Oh yeah, who gives a fuck?
[19:17.61]It's casual Q. Hey, let me ask you something, Reinhardt.
[19:25.26]Do you give a fuck?
[19:26.74]Because I don't.
[19:29.00]Fucking casual Q. I'm still alive.

[20:28.45]These guys gave a fuck.
[20:30.67]Shit.
[20:34.84]Only level 54?
[20:35.84]I don't really play this game that much.
[20:38.30]Every time I play this game, I pretty much stream it.
[20:42.16]Like, that's it.
[20:44.58]Wait, what?
[20:46.52]Get back to work.
[20:50.44]Don't worry.
[20:57.42]Wait, hold on.
[20:58.02]Something's happening in this room.
[21:01.10]Get out of here.
[21:01.84]Wait, what?
[21:08.17]What am I doing?
[21:10.49]Hi, Mr. Pinky.
[21:11.07]Thanks for five months.
[21:12.21]And again, Renix, thank you for six months.
[21:13.83]Are we going to see Fury?
[21:16.29]No, no way.
[21:17.07]This is just... I'm just taking a break.
[21:20.19]I'm not... See, the whole point of me taking a break was to, like, just chill and just fucking talk to chat for a little bit.
[21:27.14]Not to get angry at Fury.
[21:28.40]Because I'm supposed to be chilling out right now.
[21:31.84]Wait, what?
[21:36.62]It's every video I've ever made compressed into one video on the same screen.
[21:40.97]That would be kind of funny.
[21:49.45]No!
[21:50.76]What a waste!
[21:52.74]Oh my god.
[21:53.44]I just got so boned.
[21:54.82]I just got so boned.
[22:03.26]I'm doing more without the fucking buff than I was with the buff.
[22:09.96]Wow.
[22:13.22]Wow.
[22:19.13]Give it to me!
[22:22.03]I think we got some more subs that came in.
[22:26.01]Hold on.
[22:28.06]Please stream more so you don't have to read our names for two hours.
[22:37.32]I think we're gonna win right here.
[22:41.38]We gotta get rid of this Genji.
[22:44.44]Fuck.
[22:47.12]The Neverhood Loom, two months.
[22:48.82]L... L2309 is the... That's... L, he's been around for a long time.
[22:55.09]I remember him from a long, many moons ago.
[22:59.31]How long is the video?
[23:00.45]I would say probably somewhere between 20 and 30 minutes.
[23:04.25]Maybe.
[23:05.59]Might be longer.
[23:09.10]It might be longer, it might be shorter.
[23:11.90]But, oh, fuck.
[23:13.09]Hide behind this.
[23:15.93]It might even be like 45 fucking minutes.
[23:18.09]I don't know.
[23:21.05]I'm still putting it together.
[23:23.71]It will be at least... It'll be at least... 15 minutes long, I'd say.
[23:30.14]Like, at least 12 to 20 minutes long.
[23:32.64]At the very least.
[23:37.24]Wait, what?! !
[23:40.68]Oh my.
[23:41.22]Will be five hours.
[23:47.58]Lips between my hips, my goodness.
[24:00.01]Welcome, thanks a lot, man.
[24:01.64]Monkeys for six months.
[24:02.78]Neverhoodland for two months.
[24:04.12]L, like I said again.
[24:04.82]Lulladoria for five months.
[24:06.92]Fox of Fury for six months.
[24:08.22]Mr. Pinky for five months.
[24:09.52]Renix for six months.
[24:10.60]Sab for five months.
[24:12.00]Giorio for five months.
[24:13.12]We're just going down the whole list.
[24:16.77]Wait, what?
[24:21.25]Third month in a row I'm asking this.
[24:22.41]Will you marry me?
[24:24.73]No, I'm staying.
[24:26.29]I ain't getting locked down, guys.
[24:33.59]I ain't getting locked down, man.
[24:35.47]I'm gonna be single forever.
[24:38.27]No, that's not true.
[24:39.59]That's probably not true.
[24:40.85]Why didn't I like Suicide Squad?
[24:43.89]Um, I can answer that very easily.
[24:46.66]The first, like, 40 minutes of that movie, like, the first, like, 30 minutes of that movie were kind of cool.
[24:51.88]And then it just became a Will Smith movie.
[24:55.62]That's why.
[24:58.41]Suicide Squad was, like, cool.
[25:00.50]Like, oh, Suicide Squad.
[25:01.88]This is, like, kind of cool.
[25:03.24]This is a Will Smith movie.
[25:05.48]That was... They should have named it Suicide... Like, instead of Suicide Squad, like, it just should have been, like, Suicide Smith.
[25:26.07]Because it was just like Will Smith was on that mission.
[25:28.97]Pretty much nobody else.
[25:33.79]Then like the Joker scenes.
[25:35.79]Let's talk about the Joker scenes for a second.
[25:39.06]Here you go.
[25:41.08]All the things you saw in the trailer are almost every single one of his scenes.
[25:46.00]He's in the movie for like seven minutes.
[25:48.56]Like spoiler alert.
[25:50.42]The Joker's not even in that fucking movie.
[25:53.87]There's your spoiler alert.
[25:57.46]It was not a very good movie, in my opinion.
[25:59.92]Had a lot of promise, and it was very interesting.
[26:02.40]But, you took out, like, it was just a Will Smith.
[26:06.05]Now, here's the thing, right?
[26:07.99]If you like Will Smith, like, I don't, like... He's a good actor, he's fine.
[26:13.67]Like, if you are okay with it being a Will Smith movie, then you're probably gonna love Suicide Squad.
[26:21.52]But I was under the impression...
[26:23.99]That it was like all about the squad.
[26:28.98]And pretty much the whole squad are background characters.
[26:34.82]Suicide Squad, aka a bunch of extras and Will Smith.
[26:39.02]You know that guy.
[26:39.76]Why am I playing Hanzo?
[26:44.31]This is a mistake.
[26:49.37]I'm changing.
[26:52.59]What can I, like, just turn my brain off?
[26:56.17]Uh... That'd be Lúcio.
[27:02.63]And, like, the plot was a little just all over the place.
[27:05.08]Like, halfway through the movie, like, once they, like, go on the mission, I remember turning... I went with, like, three or four people.
[27:10.00]I remember turning to the people I was with at, like, the hour and ten minute mark and being like, what the fuck is going on right now?
[27:19.19]I had no idea what the fuck was going on.
[27:23.71]We had some subs here.
[27:24.79]We had a Pajiglo.
[27:27.60]I can't.
[27:28.24]I will never pronounce your name the correct way.
[27:29.82]Sorry, dude.
[27:30.62]I'm going to call you Pagi.
[27:32.06]What's going on, Pagi?
[27:34.46]Thanks for six months.
[27:35.74]Yo, Gaza for six months.
[27:38.06]Ster.
[27:38.58]Uh-oh.
[27:40.48]The big man on campus.
[27:41.72]Ster.
[27:46.26]There he is, guys.
[27:47.18]Big man on campus.
[27:48.26]Just resubscribed for six months.
[27:55.14]Who else do we have?
[27:56.82]Evo Sigma One Stilvan.
[28:00.00]Thank you guys both for six months and five months respectively.
[28:06.04]Let me get this Ana.
[28:06.76]Let me get this Ana.
[28:08.96]Yes, I got her.
[28:13.17]My way.
[28:16.19]I didn't hate Suicide Squad.
[28:17.67]I just didn't really like it at all.
[28:20.31]Doesn't that mean you hated it?
[28:43.07]And it kind of is too bad because from the trailers, that movie looked like it was going to be really cool.
[28:54.18]And don't get me wrong, there were some parts of it that were pretty cool.
[28:58.90]But as a whole, I was disappointed.
[29:02.88]Wow.
[29:04.08]Wow.
[29:14.68]I wanted to spend more time caring about the squad.
[29:18.71]Not like the mission they were going on.
[29:22.89]Or... I cared about like the squad.
[29:25.24]I wanted to hear more about the squad.
[29:30.12]Like Killer Croc?
[29:30.98]I want to know more about that guy.
[29:34.66]All they told me was he just fucking lives in like a sewer jail.
[29:38.09]That's it.
[29:39.07]Spoiler alert.
[29:40.89]Killer Croc is a guy that lives in a sewer jail.
[29:43.71]That's his entire movie.
[29:45.19]That's it.
[29:47.33]And he like punches a couple.
[29:48.51]He punches a few.
[29:49.65]He punches a few guys in the movie.
[29:53.08]Like he rears back and he punches a guy in that movie.
[29:56.74]That's it.
[30:04.57]I had my ult this whole time.
[30:06.75]Whatever, I'm just using it.
[30:11.67]Well, I think I used it.
[30:26.31]He just crawls in the water.
[30:46.17]My Lúcio is better.
[30:47.23]I think you're underestimating how much I'm playing Overwatch right now.
[30:52.51]I am like half looking at the game and half looking at the chat.
[30:55.99]I'm barely playing Overwatch right now.
[30:58.70]It's an excuse for me to just talk to chat.
[31:00.90]That's pretty much what's going on.
[31:07.80]I want to play.
[31:08.66]What's another turn your brain off?
[31:10.96]I guess no.
[31:11.50]Lúcio probably is the ultimate just turn your brain off.
[31:14.21]As long as I'm standing around people to heal.
[31:17.81]Oh, Boo!
[31:19.59]Boo-man!
[31:20.85]What's going on, Boo?
[31:21.75]Four months?
[31:22.53]Damn!
[31:23.47]Four months!
[31:25.37]Gosh darn it!
[31:30.23]Look at that!
[31:32.49]Yeah, I just fucking freaked him out.
[31:34.25]I have two games I know you'll love.
[31:44.50]wait what what games what games will I love that's a strong word man I thought it was I just I just I just I just I you know polo juice thanks for five months welcome back man is no man's sky up for pc I don't even know it might be or might not be who knows wait what oh my god really I just walked out the door
[32:13.99]Suicide Squad, to me, was just a movie, not good, not bad.
[32:16.53]Would you agree?
[32:19.21]Yeah, probably.
[32:20.21]I mean, yeah.
[32:21.76]I hate to, like, be one of those people that's like, It was fucking stupid.
[32:25.76]Jared Leto's Joker isn't even that good.
[32:28.50]And, um, I also think that lore-wise, it wasn't completely true to the comics.
[32:33.46]Like, I don't want to be one of those people.
[32:35.66]It was like a good popcorn movie.
[32:39.49]But I wasn't a fan.
[32:42.06]I didn't like it.
[32:47.44]Can you believe what they did to Harley Quinn?
[32:50.48]They didn't even put her in the correct makeup.
[32:52.30]She has two pink braids in her hair and they didn't even put them in.
[32:58.16]Can you believe that?
[33:01.88]Somebody kill him.
[33:03.56]Kill him.
[33:05.24]I'll do it.
[33:05.64]Where'd he go?
[33:17.32]Gotta show love for Pockbomber.
[33:18.77]Yeah.
[33:20.47]They do have their place.
[33:24.75]I wasn't stamping my feet out of the movie there.
[33:26.43]Oh, no.
[33:34.38]Got ya.
[33:38.14]Let me get my ult, please.
[33:39.48]Uh-oh.

[33:55.64]We really have to do this for another two minutes.
[33:56.96]I'm going to hold on to this.
[34:05.56]I don't want everyone just to die.
[34:06.97]Speaking of dying...
[34:14.59]I actually probably need to use it because we're like all dead You only started subscription six months ago no people have been like for like ten months now I Think the longest probably ten or eleven
[34:46.51]Do you know the Jerma rant?
[34:48.18]What's the Jerma rant?
[34:49.00]I feel like that happens frequently enough where it could be any one of a number of things.
[34:55.26]Oh, shit.
[34:57.38]Give me a break!
[34:59.55]Ah!
[34:59.67]I was trying to save more people.
[35:02.95]I wasn't ready.
[35:05.23]Shit.
[35:09.29]I'm actually surprised we're doing this.
[35:14.42]Really was not confident that this was going to happen.
[35:20.74]Do I have a sniper?
[35:21.48]Do I have a filmmaker now?
[35:29.72]Oh boy.
[35:30.50]Don't do it yet.
[35:31.32]Don't do it yet.
[35:31.88]We're not in that immediate of danger.
[35:38.86]Plus, I'm only going to get one more of these, so...
[35:47.40]Yeah, there are people that I subbed for nine months.
[35:50.21]For sure.
[35:52.49]For certain.
[35:55.95]Here comes their last push.
[36:04.31]Well, hopefully it was enough.
[36:10.28]Show us the thumbnail for the video.
[36:11.66]I don't have a thumbnail for it.
[36:16.06]I gotta finish the video before I have a thumbnail.

[36:45.97]Yes.
[36:47.13]Yes.
[36:49.65]But we're changing up the strategy a little.
[37:02.43]Give us an arc to solve the video.
[37:05.23]Okay.
[37:06.07]You ready?
[37:06.95]Here's the first part of the arc.

[44:07.36]I didn't watch out for the bird woman.
[44:08.44]You're correct.
[44:20.39]I really want to just run in there.
[44:21.69]Hit for my monthly hug?
[44:27.51]Thank you, Nicktree.

[45:52.97]Apparently not.
[45:56.65]I want to get rid of that Zenyatta.
[46:02.61]Don't grab me.
[46:06.77]Shit.
[46:09.40]Hyperion scum.

[46:42.65]Otto, where are you?
[46:43.17]I don't know if I want to play him again.
[46:50.37]What am I going to do now?
[46:55.58]Um... Um...
[47:00.43]I could play Reinhardt.
[47:03.97]Month nine update.
[47:06.15]Kaldaka, thank you, Jerma, is still a cutie.
[47:09.38]Well, thank you, that's very nice of you.
[47:11.82]That's very nice of you.
[47:14.10]I'll play Rein.
[47:16.74]Why not?
[47:18.57]Who gives a shit, this fucking casual Q?
[47:20.09]Who gives a shit?
[47:28.62]That's a sub, baby, you're right.
[47:32.74]Wow, there he goes.
[47:37.90]He's still alive.

[47:43.04]That's fine, so do I. That's fine, so do I. Oh, I could scoop around.
[47:58.68]Here comes a charge, but I got one too!
[48:01.70]Fuck.
[48:13.73]Five months until the next video?
[48:15.54]No.
[48:16.56]No, no, no, no, no.
[48:29.01]What do I got?
[48:31.07]Okay.
[48:33.67]What was that?
[48:34.21]It was like people were just frozen in time.
[48:35.83]Is he dead?
[48:45.81]He's not.
[48:48.45]Now he is.
[48:48.97]Alright, now let's go in.
[48:49.87]Let's get in there.
[48:55.38]Good.
[48:55.66]Fucking pile in.
[48:58.02]Violent, so I can hit my Q. Why don't you come down here and say that to my face?
[49:12.79]Why don't you come over here and say that to my face?
[49:20.29]Why don't you say that to my face?
[49:26.30]I don't even give a fuck.
[49:28.16]Why did I do that?
[49:28.96]I'm not playing.
[49:29.46]I don't like him.
[49:41.15]What is the big video?
[49:43.39]You'll see in like a week.
[49:45.91]I promise it's not going to take that long.
[49:48.91]It's not going to take more than a week or two.
[49:50.68]Watch out for the fucking bus!
[49:57.57]Only going to be three minutes long.
[50:01.07]No.
[50:01.69]This is going to be like 30 minutes long.
[50:04.39]This video is going to be like 25.
[50:08.35]Maybe less.
[50:09.25]Maybe more.
[50:09.77]But not three.
[50:10.63]Definitely more than 10.
[50:11.95]And absolutely less than 50.
[50:12.99]We're going to get it.
[50:27.94]I'm doing some work here as the Dunkin' Donuts Rat.
[50:31.01]The Dunk Rat.
[50:40.91]Nice.
[50:41.17]Nice job as Dunkin' Donuts Rat.
[50:42.82]I heard they're renaming him, guys.
[50:47.18]Lizard's like doing a thing.
[50:48.16]He's the Dunkin' Donuts Rat.
[50:53.68]I don't know why I think that's funny.
[51:08.78]Oh, boy.

[52:07.58]Thank you, Chef Laurent, for four months.
[52:15.23]I did absolutely nothing.
[52:22.27]It's okay, though.
[52:27.17]I almost just said what the video was.
[52:28.77]Wow.
[52:29.49]I need to put a fucking muzzle on.
[52:32.03]I legitimately almost just said.
[52:33.85]I should probably go back to... Almost did it.
[52:37.28]Almost got it.
[52:53.72]5, 5, 5, 5, 5.
[53:00.87]Don't say it.
[53:14.34]You're making a 5 video.
[53:17.76]No, I'm not going to say what it is.
[53:22.34]It's just... You're just gonna see it.
[53:26.45]You're just gonna see it.
[53:28.39]And you're gonna be like... What a fucking psycho.
[53:34.15]Alright, I'll tell you... Alright.
[53:36.09]You pushed me far enough.
[53:37.21]You pushed me to the edge, guys.
[53:39.13]Here it is.
[53:39.81]Here's what the video is.
[53:42.47]It's a noodle slurping video.
[53:45.34]Fuck, I can't believe I just said it.
[53:46.46]I take different ramen and I... And I try them.
[53:51.02]For 45 minutes.
[53:56.92]Did it.
[53:59.71]Let's see what my fucking play of the game was.
[54:03.95]Nice.

[54:11.79]Remember this shit?
[54:12.98]Bang, bang, bang, bang.
[54:13.68]I remember that.
[54:18.68]Nice.
[54:22.04]Yeah, it's a noodle slurping video.
[54:29.03]No, it's just me, uh, it's just me eating, like, various fruits.
[54:34.09]Which, by the way, I mean, like, let's be honest here.
[54:38.82]Eat more fruit.
[54:43.50]You really should just, like, go, like, to the store and buy, like, at least enough fruits to allow your body to, uh, recuperate, you know?
[54:53.56]Apples, we're talking apples, grapes, blueberries, like, just eat more fucking fruit.
[54:59.35]Way more.
[55:15.22]How did I get a silver medal?
[55:21.52]God.
[55:24.43]I smell like a banana right now.
[55:26.01]A nice, crisp, crunchy banana.
[55:28.99]When was the last time you had one of those?
[55:31.83]Like a handful of blueberries.
[55:33.56]You should go buy them.
[55:34.26]You should go buy like a handful of blueberries.
[55:38.40]You should do that.
[55:42.20]Hashtag fruit.
[55:44.22]Hashtag fruit.

[61:13.04]Jeremiah, I couldn't figure out how to leave a sub message, but my girlfriend paid for my subscription because she wanted to say hi.
[61:17.40]Her name is Amanda.
[61:18.90]Hi, Amanda.
[61:20.12]Thank you for paying for his subscription.
[61:24.36]Welcome to the channel.

[61:32.97]Not that.
[61:33.63]This one.
[61:34.75]After I, like, hide and get this fucking little health capsule.
[61:40.25]Do that to a reaper.
[61:41.75]Get out of here.
[61:44.76]This is why Star doesn't play with you?
[61:46.16]Because I play this game for like an hour a week.
[61:50.24]Like two hours a week.
[61:51.14]Yeah, I'd say so.
[61:56.77]I would probably say so.
[62:03.73]Waffle of Wonder.
[62:04.93]Welcome back.
[62:05.33]Thanks for five months of waffle.
[62:06.71]How are you doing?
[62:07.21]I'm pretty good.
[62:09.78]Jerry's doing pretty good right now.
[62:12.22]He will say.
[62:13.50]I speak for him.
[62:18.21]I could probably get off this character at the moment.
[62:23.33]Yeah, I'm going to get off.
[62:24.47]I'm going to get off.
[62:25.29]How much time do we have left?
[62:26.19]No, I'm not.
[62:26.73]I have like 60% off.
[62:32.28]Five hours a month.
[62:33.18]That's probably like an hour to a week.
[62:36.68]Might be five.
[62:39.43]Do I almost have a million views on Twitch?
[62:41.29]Oh, shit.
[62:41.77]Oh, my God.
[62:42.25]I really do.
[62:44.79]We might pass 1 million total Twitch views.
[62:48.33]Damn.
[62:55.62]I'm gonna go like that way.
[62:58.34]Watch out for the fucking red dragon.
[63:01.48]Did I not get hit by that?
[63:02.44]Shit.
[63:06.14]I'm gonna just win.
[63:08.26]Yeah, we're just gonna win.
[63:09.72]Okay, whatever.
[63:12.75]Did it happen?
[63:14.40]Did I get to a million views?
[63:16.50]One million total views?
[63:20.66]I gotta refresh.
[63:22.96]Let's see.
[63:28.17]Oh, God, 900,000.
[63:28.41]999,983.
[63:28.43]That's crazy.
[63:29.11]Well, thanks for a million views, guys, on Twitch.
[63:30.81]I mean, yeah, that's cool.
[63:32.19]Almost one million.
[63:33.03]Wow.
[63:33.11]That was so loud.
[63:57.76]One billion this stream.
[64:01.18]I don't think that would be possible if... Here's how that might be possible.
[64:07.12]I still don't think it would be, but... Thank you, Tubby, for three months.
[64:12.29]Hey, Dermot, just your monthly reminder that you're my absolute favorite content creator on any platform.
[64:15.27]You deserve a break.
[64:16.65]Keep it up.
[64:18.33]Well, Tubby, I had my break.
[64:19.77]Hope the beginning of the video is Batboy's origin story.
[64:25.25]Thank you, Death Jason, Waffle of Wonder, and Tubby Momo for three months and five months, respectively.
[64:33.60]Yeah, I took my break.
[64:35.85]It was much needed.
[64:38.10]I kind of just hung out with family and friends.
[64:41.94]And got to work on this video.
[64:43.94]We sure enough... I almost just said something I didn't want to say.
[64:51.36]But we sure enough finished it.
[64:56.18]And it just needs to be... Yeah.
[65:03.56]But thank you.
[65:08.04]He knows the Batboy story is true.
[65:12.73]Wouldn't that be a hoot?
[65:18.37]I don't know what the hell I'm going to do now.
[65:23.08]I'll just play Mei.
[65:23.94]Whatever.
[65:25.12]Just woke up missing the streams.
[65:28.54]Can't wait for the big gulp-sized video.
[65:37.54]It's coming.
[65:40.48]It's definitely coming.
[65:43.44]Give a sneak preview for the 850 people here.
[65:47.42]No, I can't do that.
[65:49.80]Somebody will screen.
[65:50.82]Somebody will screen, grab it.
[65:53.44]And then it'll be passed around.
[65:57.84]Even if only like a thousand people see it.
[66:02.38]That's a surprise.
[66:03.44]That is ruined for a thousand people.
[66:07.44]Hey, Jerma, I'm in Boston.
[66:08.48]Hope I see you on the street.
[66:11.38]Well, maybe I'll see you on the street.
[66:14.76]I'm not going to be in Boston today, though.
[66:18.12]I'm not going to be in Boston.
[66:22.48]I hope you enjoy the city.
[66:23.62]It's a pretty cool city.
[66:33.20]Four, three, two, one.
[66:38.55]Tell us in code what it's going to be.
[66:43.41]I can't do it.
[66:45.92]Show us the last second of the video.
[66:47.48]No.
[66:48.62]Any second of this video would ruin the video.
[66:51.82]Like for people that don't want to know what it is.
[66:57.34]Any second.
[67:00.49]They're all over here.
[67:01.77]I did not expect this many people to be here.
[67:05.49]I thought it was going to be like two dudes.
[67:10.79]I just jumped him up here, didn't I?
[67:17.34]Come on, let me frisbee the shit in there.
[67:18.60]Let me frisbee it in there.
[67:24.82]Freeze!
[67:27.85]Aww.
[67:31.39]Play a second of audio?
[67:32.19]Huh, I might be able to do that.
[67:38.21]No, I can't do that.
[67:40.63]The very first frame?
[67:41.53]Can't do that.
[67:44.79]Cannot do that.
[67:51.43]Can we just stop talking about this video and talk about how we should be eating more fucking bananas and apples and shit?
[67:58.90]I think that's more important.
[68:00.12]That's more important than us talking about this video.
[68:03.84]Is, did you have a pear today?
[68:06.32]And if the answer is no, then fuck, dude.
[68:08.78]Like, come on.
[68:29.11]No!
[68:29.83]No!
[68:31.55]Freeze!
[68:33.19]Freeze!
[68:35.63]Uhhh... Holy shit.
[68:41.25]What a super... This Zenyatta needs to get out of here.
[68:59.10]Are pears even in season?
[69:00.46]God, I hope so.
[69:03.76]God, I hope so.
[69:18.24]Freeze!
[69:21.54]God.
[69:25.15]Did the project cost... How did the project cost $3,000?
[69:27.01]The project costed about $7,000, so... When it was all said and done.
[69:40.32]I tapped... I tapped into my, like, life savings to do this.
[69:46.63]What a psycho.
[69:47.65]Destroy him!
[69:53.47]Whoa!
[69:56.94]All the colors.
[70:02.06]Hey, Boosh.
[70:03.88]The mighty Boosh.
[70:05.22]511, thanks for subscribing, dude.
[70:06.46]Welcome.
[70:07.79]Johnny Kravitz for five months.
[70:09.97]Welcome back, dude.
[70:14.71]5,000 of it was spent on hot dogs.
[70:15.83]He's actually crazy.
[70:20.85]Alright, here's a real, you want to hear some like behind the scenes?
[70:24.60]Here's some behind the scenes for you.
[70:27.42]So I have two retirement accounts, right?
[70:32.84]I have two retirement accounts that I'm not supposed to fucking touch.
[70:38.53]And I pulled money out of one of my retirement accounts to like make the video.
[70:48.55]That's real.
[70:51.24]I ripped my financial advisor.
[70:56.34]He was like, you need to take out some money.
[71:00.92]Why?
[71:01.08]I'm just like, you know, I got this project that I'm working on.
[71:04.52]And he's like, huh.
[71:06.46]I was like, okay.
[71:07.02]Okay.
[71:22.66]I'm fine.
[71:23.36]Don't worry.
[71:26.37]I told you I had two accounts.
[71:28.05]Right?
[71:28.43]Did you hear that?
[71:31.37]And the other one's full of fucking money.
[71:33.75]Don't worry about it.
[71:34.45]I'll be fine.
[71:36.27]The other one's like fucking... They can't even put the lid on the trash can.
[71:40.39]Because there's like ones and fives sticking out of it.
[71:51.40]Why two?
[71:51.92]One's a 401k, the other one is a Roth.
[71:56.59]Yeah.
[71:57.65]Don't worry, I'll be fine.
[72:03.91]This guy's talking 401k!
[72:10.83]It was worth it.
[72:12.37]I can tell you right now, it was definitely worth it.
[72:24.51]I lost all my money in hot dog stocks.
[72:31.59]No, it's not crazy if... Hold on, I guess about... What is your absolute favorite thing ever?
[72:37.32]What's my absolute... Axe and Daily wants to know what my absolute favorite thing ever is.
[72:43.54]Blueberry smoothie.
[72:48.73]Definitely.
[72:49.37]Like a blueberry yogurt smoothie.
[72:52.97]Motivating.
[72:56.90]Jeremy's financial advisor is Oscar the Grouch.
[73:01.96]No, here's the thing.
[73:05.64]Like, I don't care.
[73:09.74]See, people think that, like, there are some of us still that don't give a fuck about how much money they have or make.
[73:16.25]You know, those people still kind of exist.
[73:19.28]I don't give a fuck.
[73:24.10]Like, people that I know are like, hold on, dude, you're gonna lose, like, thousands of dollars on this video?
[73:30.10]I don't give a fuck.
[73:34.87]I'm fine.
[73:35.47]I'll be okay.
[73:38.69]It's not about the money.
[73:41.17]It's not about the money.
[73:42.58]It's about sending a message.
[73:47.32]Who is, where is Harvey Depp?
[73:49.10]You know, have you seen him?
[74:01.13]Says the guy with two retirement accounts.
[74:11.33]Like, if I want to do something, and I have, like, the possible means to do it, I'm going to do it.
[74:19.30]You only get one chance.
[74:20.24]You only get one life, man.
[74:24.90]Like, at least I have a decent time doing it, you know?
[74:48.13]I didn't make this video to make money.
[74:52.63]I made this video because I wanted to make it.
[74:57.03]That's it.
[74:58.78]And I had this theory that a large amount of people that have been watching my channel for years would get a kick out of it.
[75:09.82]That's what matters to me, so I'm going to do it.
[75:15.93]What are you doing, dog?
[75:19.13]Hey.
[75:19.33]What are you doing?
[75:24.53]Dog's like, freaking out.
[75:31.45]Somebody come out!
[75:36.73]There we go.
[75:37.27]Ah, shit.
[75:40.77]I don't think we did it.
[75:45.44]I think we did it.
[75:46.48]We did it.
[75:57.27]What if everyone hates the video?
[75:58.73]Well, then, whatever.
[76:00.07]I tried.
[76:00.43]Do you have to be a long-time fan to get the project?
[76:09.57]No, no, of course not.
[76:12.86]Absolutely not.
[76:16.77]Hey, come in here.
[76:19.91]What are you doing out there?
[76:20.57]What are you scratching at?
[76:26.96]Sketchy Dragon, thank you for six months.
[76:29.50]Did I miss anybody else?
[76:31.62]X not, oh, not Zelda X. X not Zelda X, thank you for two months.
[76:42.13]It's a vacation vlog.
[76:50.02]Asdy.
[76:50.82]Asdy wasdy.
[77:19.74]Is that A-S-D?
[77:21.38]W-A-S-D?
[77:23.76]Whatever your name happens to be.
[77:25.74]Are we playing?
[77:26.44]Oh, no.
[77:27.52]Welcome, dude.
[77:28.02]Thanks for something.
[77:30.60]Did I spend money on a camera?
[77:32.42]No.
[77:33.10]Okay, so that money went towards a bunch of different things.
[77:39.10]Not a camera, per se.
[77:42.69]But a bunch of things.
[77:45.73]That money went to two clown cars and 20 clowns.
[77:53.79]Thanks, P-Man.
[77:54.45]Welcome back for six months.
[78:04.14]Yeah, I mean, how was I going to afford two clown cars and 20 clowns?
[78:08.56]Really?
[78:10.58]I wouldn't.
[78:16.54]If somebody guesses it right, will I acknowledge it?
[78:18.28]No.
[78:20.94]I will not.
[78:34.33]Made a bunch of... I got a big car.
[78:36.85]Is he joking about the clowns?
[78:40.41]I don't know.
[78:40.87]You're going to have to find out.
[78:45.19]I'm so glad I'm three months away from being birthed.
[78:47.53]Well, thank you.
[78:49.09]Psychoblade 2015.
[78:51.67]You'll be born soon enough.
[78:57.71]That means we already guessed it.
[78:58.71]Not necessarily.
[79:02.29]Thanks, Benji.
[79:02.79]Benji, welcome back.
[79:06.10]The thing that I like... Here's the thing, though.
[79:07.56]This is one of the things I fear.
[79:12.06]Wish me happy birthday, even though my birthday's in December.
[79:14.42]Well, disco.
[79:15.56]Gypsy fish.
[79:17.88]Happy birthday.
[79:18.54]You know what?
[79:19.84]Merry Christmas while we're at it.
[79:23.58]Here's what I fear.
[79:24.84]I don't want to be afraid or feared, but... I don't want to over-hype this video.
[79:31.42]Like, oh my god, it's the fucking most ridiculous fucking thing you're ever gonna see in your life.
[79:37.01]Because I don't want to have this huge expectation...
[79:43.65]I mean, it's kind of already there.
[79:47.07]But, I mean, I don't know what to say.
[79:48.85]You're going to have to see what it is in like a less than, I would say less than a full week.
[79:52.97]I hope so.
[79:54.85]But I don't want it to be one of those things where people are just like, wow, this was fucking terrible.
[79:58.46]You suck.
[79:59.12]You hyped this up way too much.
[80:02.06]So, okay, just pretend like the video is going to suck, okay?
[80:05.74]Even though it's not.
[80:07.16]Even though it's not.
[80:08.00]It's not going to suck, but just think it is.
[80:09.84]So then you're like, nobody hates me when the video comes out.
[80:28.93]I've got you in my sights It's gonna be the best thing
[80:39.62]It will open up more doors, though, for me to... Because I want to do more of these.
[80:44.47]I talked about it before.
[80:45.55]My, like, kind of philosophy on YouTube.
[80:47.85]I was going to make a video talking about it.
[80:50.27]But I figured I might as well just upload the damn thing.
[80:53.25]And talk about it some other time.
[80:56.31]Well, ButtLM.
[80:59.78]Just resubscribed.
[81:00.48]Thank you, Butt.
[81:02.08]But I'm...
[81:11.26]But for those of you that don't know, after this video goes up, you're going to start to see a lot of videos on the channel.
[81:19.12]Shit.
[81:20.80]It's going to be a lot of stream stuff, a lot of highlight videos in the sense.
[81:28.87]But in the meantime, videos like the one you're going to see in the week are the videos that I'm going to hold on.
[81:35.47]Those are the videos I'm going to be making from now on.
[81:39.78]So, like, once every, like, three or four months, there'll be a video that has the same, like, that took more than a month, like, to make.
[81:47.34]I want my channel to be focused on content like that.
[81:52.78]And in the meantime, while I'm working on doing, like, bigger kind of projects, I'll be streaming, and there'll be stream highlights on the channel.
[82:05.63]By none other than HolyMacroThe3rd.
[82:09.56]You guys know him.
[82:10.22]He's here.
[82:13.64]Shit.
[82:15.46]Thank you, Stumpy.
[82:20.81]Or Stimpy, to be more precise.
[82:24.79]Welcome to the channel.
[82:36.69]And that's like... I'm gonna do that for probably like a year.
[82:40.06]And see where the channel is at that point.
[82:44.22]You know what I mean?
[82:44.82]Like if I can get like three or four videos... That... That took a bunch of time to make and... They're not just straight up like... Like even if they are like video game videos, like I want them to be things that took time to make.
[82:59.57]I wanna focus on one like big video... While the stream highlights just go up on a regular basis.
[83:07.23]Talked about it before, but I'm not sure how many people.
[83:09.43]Like I said, remember what I talked about in the beginning?
[83:10.91]A lot of people just don't even know where the hell you are or what you're doing.
[83:14.69]You can say something like three or four times, but, like, it's hard to keep track of a bunch of people.
[83:21.12]And, like, who has heard these things, who hasn't heard these things.
[83:24.32]Like I said, there's a shitload of people that think I'm just gone.
[83:28.97]I get comments that are just like, oh, he's gone.
[83:30.63]Nice knowing you.
[83:45.83]How long did the patch notes video take?
[83:48.63]Like a couple weeks.
[83:50.97]Not to make the video, but to come up with something.
[83:53.40]That took me probably a week and a half.
[83:55.22]I had to make that device.
[83:58.20]I had to figure out what I wanted to do.
[83:59.76]I want more of that.
[84:03.04]I want more videos that I think, what am I doing in this video?
[84:07.98]Is this video funny?
[84:08.76]Do I like this video?
[84:09.74]Am I happy with this?
[84:18.72]Oh, that's gonna be another one.
[84:19.78]That's gonna be another one.
[84:22.68]Where is he?
[84:26.01]Oh, fuck.
[84:27.63]Wow, what?
[84:35.83]Quality over quantity?
[84:38.25]I mean, yeah, but it's more so... Look, when I... When I first started YouTube...
[84:47.75]I had no idea that it was going to be like this.
[84:50.83]And I had all these pie in the sky.
[84:54.96]I had all these pie in the sky things that I always wanted to do, but never had the means to do them.
[85:06.48]And now I'm just like, you know what?
[85:07.76]I think we lose.
[85:15.03]Oh my god, what great alien denial.
[85:26.10]Vids every three months is not quality over quantity.
[85:28.20]It's not making vids.
[85:29.96]Well, when those videos cost like 10 grand to make and require lots of people to make, that is quality over quantity.
[85:42.07]We live in this weird world.
[85:43.23]Okay, here we go.
[85:44.31]You want to hear me talk like shit about this whole scene?
[85:48.19]Because I'll do it.
[85:49.96]I'll do it.
[85:53.38]This whole fucking thing.
[85:55.16]You want me to just go off on this whole goddamn thing?
[85:58.16]Because I will.
[86:13.61]ChewyRock, thanks for five months.
[86:15.11]And DaneTech also subscribed during that.
[86:17.45]And TheDiaBeatles, I remember you.
[86:19.41]Thanks for four months, dude.
[86:25.31]We kind of live in a world right now in like the internet kind of making video world where making like three videos a day is more important and valued more than somebody making like a video once every like few weeks.
[86:47.51]The amount of like just people that just throw up whatever the fuck they're currently just just upload fucking whatever the fuck they don't give a shit.
[86:56.59]Could be anything.
[87:00.81]Like we could we live in a world right now where that's like considered like that's what you should be doing.
[87:08.14]And I fucking hate it.
[87:12.56]I don't like it at all.
[87:13.40]I fucking despise it.
[87:17.34]And I like tried to do it.
[87:19.62]Long time ago.
[87:20.96]I was making like a video every single day.
[87:23.50]Like sometimes two in a day.
[87:25.98]And I'm just being like... This is fucking stupid.
[87:31.71]Like this is... I don't... I don't like... Half these videos I'm just like... I like... You know, I'm just phoning them in.
[87:38.91]And I stopped doing it.
[87:39.81]You got... Remember when I made like... I'm gonna make a schedule.
[87:41.89]There's gonna be fucking a video like two... One to two videos a day.
[87:44.87]I did it for like three weeks and I fucking hated it.
[87:48.53]But we live in this fucking world where if you don't make like four or five videos a week, you're lazy.
[87:57.52]Or you don't care.
[87:58.32]When it's actually most likely the complete opposite.
[88:04.56]It's the complete opposite.
[88:09.04]Do I make a lot less money?
[88:10.14]You fucking betcha.
[88:12.42]Could I be making fucking tons of money on YouTube?
[88:17.68]Absolutely.
[88:19.59]You want me to lie?
[88:20.89]No.
[88:22.31]I could be making lots of fucking goddamn money.
[88:26.62]But, like, I don't give a shit.
[88:29.10]That type of, like, philosophy pisses me off.
[88:36.78]And when people get angry with you for, like, not making videos, but, like, you have to understand, I want to, like, make videos.
[88:47.93]I don't just want to play video games.
[88:49.31]You know what I mean?
[88:52.69]I don't just want to play video games and upload me playing video games.
[88:55.25]I don't want to do that.
[88:57.17]That's not something that I... I'll do that here.
[88:58.75]That's what I'm doing right now.
[89:00.60]I'll do that up here.
[89:13.17]But yeah, that's the sad truth about it is... You're like bunched in with all the other YouTubers and shit.
[89:22.27]And you don't make videos every day, so you're lazy.
[89:26.41]You're not doing it right.
[89:30.22]And it's like... Okay.
[89:34.60]Alright.
[89:35.14]That's okay.
[89:36.38]Kind of just walking into my own death.
[89:48.27]And look, keep this in mind, this is not me being like, oh my god, I'm so... I'm the piece of the puzzle that you're not seeing.
[89:56.22]I'm the one that's gonna save YouTube, and I'm a good person.
[90:00.70]No, there are a lot of people that make good content on YouTube.
[90:02.62]There's a shitload of them.
[90:05.96]But the fact that... It's not considered cool to make a video a week, or a video every couple weeks.
[90:15.60]This is not...
[90:29.73]And like I said, this is what I want to do.
[90:35.55]I've always run my channel, and even this one too, just streaming and everything.
[90:39.07]If I want to do it, I'm going to do it.
[90:42.57]You know why I don't stream all the time?
[90:46.27]Take a guess.
[90:48.42]Because sometimes I just don't want to do it.
[90:51.08]And I'm not feeling it.
[90:53.20]And I don't want to phone in a live stream just because I have to.
[90:57.30]You know what I'm saying?
[91:01.83]We live in like a everybody has to do it rather than people want to do it.
[91:08.81]And I don't like it.
[91:22.91]Two Zaryas?
[91:23.57]Oh, double Zarya.
[91:24.41]This is fucking casual if I've ever seen it.
[91:31.79]Sneak in there.
[91:32.97]Oh, just snuck in.
[91:37.18]Oh, boy.
[91:42.00]Don't kill me.
[91:44.04]Is he a full charge already?
[91:59.27]I have the right idea.
[92:01.50]I'm not even sure if I do.
[92:03.50]You know what I mean?
[92:05.10]These are just my personal vendettas and opinions on the platform.
[92:10.16]Am I fucking wrong?
[92:11.08]Am I right?
[92:11.62]I don't know.
[92:13.64]Might be.
[92:25.93]Boosted Zenyatta.
[92:26.95]Is that what just happened?
[92:37.45]Wow, where is he?
[92:39.53]What the?
[92:40.45]What?
[92:40.89]I have so much charge right now.
[92:49.14]It would be a shame if I died.
[92:50.40]I died.
[92:56.78]Ever consider setting up a group site for YouTubers with the same idea of wanting to make original content?
[93:02.70]Um.
[93:05.08]No, because it wouldn't work.
[93:07.84]It just wouldn't work.
[93:09.62]YouTube and, like, sites like YouTube are just so convenient and already locked in with subscriptions and everybody has this.
[93:15.88]Because, look, I understand that people are subscribed to a lot of people.
[93:20.54]You don't want to be pulled from a place just because, like, these, like, four guys wanted to make a new website.
[93:27.50]It's just, like... I mean, I wouldn't want to do it.
[93:32.56]I just did it again.
[93:34.22]Oh, fuck.
[93:36.70]I'm sorry, I'm not like paying attention.
[93:38.62]I'm gonna pretend like I was part of that.
[93:40.08]Yeah, we did it guys!
[93:40.92]Did you see that ult?
[93:58.69]People always wanna talk about bottom line.
[94:00.23]I don't have a bottom line.
[94:06.95]My bottom line is, am I enjoying it?
[94:09.43]Did I have fun doing what I was doing?
[94:11.27]Did I want to do what I'm doing?
[94:16.75]And unfortunately, the bottom line for a lot of people is, what's my paycheck this month?
[94:22.88]Did I get paid?
[94:23.84]Did I make money?
[94:25.12]How much money did I make?
[94:26.04]How can I make more of that?
[94:27.96]How can I make more of that fucking money?
[94:30.31]Oh, here's a way.
[94:31.47]Here's like three ways.
[94:34.31]My job.
[94:57.06]Do you know if Star stopped enjoying making videos?
[95:04.51]No.
[95:05.73]No.
[95:07.01]He definitely likes making videos.
[95:11.07]But he's currently doing his thing, right?
[95:14.35]He's doing great on Twitch.
[95:16.09]He's doing Overwatch.
[95:17.07]He's all over the place with Overwatch.
[95:21.73]He's locked down with what he wants to do.
[95:23.10]And he's going to do it.
[95:28.64]But hey, Heretic.
[95:30.04]Heretic Anchorite.
[95:32.16]Six months.
[95:32.58]Welcome back, dude.
[95:33.42]Stutz.
[95:34.28]These names.
[95:36.30]I'm going to have trouble.
[95:37.76]I'm going to have trouble.
[95:39.89]Stu's Stu's Stu could chew.
[95:42.63]I was trying to say, like, Stutzt.
[95:48.16]Oh, thanks a lot, man.
[95:48.70]Welcome back.
[95:49.54]Did I get Chewie Rock?
[95:50.68]Five months, Chewie Rock?
[96:07.01]Put the cap on my point, and we'll move on.
[96:11.76]like, the mon- like, the extreme monetization of, like, internet culture at this point, where it's just, it's not even, it's just, it's just moneyball.
[96:26.39]It's just turned, like, when the platform turned into as much as possible for as much money as possible.
[96:33.73]And people will pretend that that's not the case, but it is.
[96:38.12]People will tell you that it's different.
[96:40.30]No, no, no.
[96:41.54]I'm not like that.
[96:43.82]But you just are.
[96:46.97]No, no, no.
[96:47.65]I would never say something like that.
[96:50.73]Jervis, wrong!
[97:07.00]Maybe I'm just old.
[97:09.19]Maybe I'm just old.
[97:10.81]That's a possibility too, guys.
[97:20.98]But I will say that being scolded for not making... Being scolded for wanting to make a video rather than play a video game with a camera on.
[97:33.00]It's like it's two different things.
[97:35.88]Unfortunately, what I was trying to say is we're all lumped into the same category.
[97:41.77]Well, I'm expected to do certain things because of the expectations that people have already.
[97:52.48]And fuck.
[97:54.46]Fuck it.
[97:54.96]You know what I mean?
[98:04.70]Die!
[98:05.22]He's still alive.
[98:12.37]This feels like a Brojack Horseman episode.
[98:20.27]Who scalded you?
[98:21.03]There's not anyone in particular.
[98:31.18]Holy shit, I hit him directly.
[98:40.62]I wanted to do it, but that would be a mistake.
[98:45.30]Well, maybe I will do it.
[98:47.84]Maybe I will do it.
[98:49.19]Maybe I will.
[98:53.91]I shouldn't have done it.
[99:00.13]But if there's one thing that I can promise you guys, it's just I will never be unreal with you guys.
[99:08.44]Ever.
[99:10.94]I'm not gonna feed you dog shit.
[99:12.78]I'm not gonna tell you something that's not true.
[99:16.56]Oh, maybe I will, but... Leslie5544, thank you for the sub.
[99:24.75]I mean, I might like just lie to tell a joke.
[99:27.33]Like if it's a joke or something.
[99:34.93]They call us influencers.
[99:37.79]That's fucking stupid.
[99:40.61]Here we go again.
[99:41.71]He's gonna go again.
[99:42.61]He's gonna go.
[99:43.27]Let him take a sip.
[99:48.21]We're called influencers.
[99:50.74]How fucking stupid does that sound?
[99:53.46]Doesn't that sound terrible?
[99:54.28]Oh, yes.
[99:56.10]Let's see who the latest influencer is.
[99:58.64]Let's get an influencer.
[100:00.42]Don't call us influencers.
[100:03.02]That's the dumbest fucking thing ever.
[100:05.24]That enrages me.
[100:10.46]Oh, we have this group of influencers coming in to check a li- No, don't fucking say that.
[100:15.14]Don't fucking say that.
[100:18.66]Shove your fucking marketing terms up your ass.
[100:26.21]We're like influenza.
[100:35.43]You know what most of us do?
[100:36.78]We play fucking video games.
[100:47.07]We're not, like, fucking, like, political presidents.
[100:53.51]Ooh, I snagged that one.
[101:06.73]Like, what am I influencing?
[101:09.97]That, that, well, I'm trying to sell you something?
[101:11.62]Watch this!
[101:12.32]Watch this!
[101:12.76]I'll show you, fucking influencer!
[101:14.42]Fuck.
[101:18.54]Using that terminology makes it sound like, and that's what, this is what, this is what I'm talking about.
[101:23.65]This is the whole thing I was talking about.
[101:25.83]Like, that you're trying to sell somebody something.
[101:27.67]You're trying to sell them an idea.
[101:29.21]You're trying to, like, what is this, Inception?
[101:32.69]Oh, it is a group of people that, like, are very respected.
[101:35.52]They have a lot of push, and they're very influenceable, and they can really influence people to do things.
[101:40.04]And, uh, check out this new game I found.
[101:41.96]Check it out, that game.
[101:44.62]Have I influenced you yet?
[101:48.94]That shit is so fucking tiring.
[101:55.54]What is this?
[101:56.40]Is it like propaganda?
[101:58.08]Or do we make YouTube videos and stream?
[102:02.82]I'm going off for real here, guys.
[102:04.24]You guys got me going.
[102:21.29]But this is real shit.
[102:23.18]This is how I really feel.
[102:29.54]So wait, who calls you that?
[102:30.36]YouTube?
[102:31.50]Type in the word influencer into Google.
[102:34.60]Like YouTube.
[102:35.44]And you're going to get so much fucking stuff.
[102:39.24]It's just like companies and fucking cash.
[102:43.38]Transactions.
[102:44.50]Sponsorships.
[102:47.10]Yeah.
[102:48.06]That's what I'm talking about.
[102:50.89]Wait, what?
[102:53.29]I missed a couple subs on my, like, tirade.
[102:56.21]Custy15, thanks for four months.
[102:57.79]FappleDapple, thanks for six months.
[102:59.03]And Leslie, take a look at this guy shouting out.
[103:02.49]Hey, I'm shouting the stream out.
[103:03.69]Shouting you guys out for your five dollars.
[103:10.20]Thanks, man.
[103:12.22]Thanks to all you guys for being a part of this group.
[103:16.00]Remember, it's only five dollars.
[103:17.22]Because I don't want to be a hypocrite.
[103:21.48]And that's kind of me being a hypocrite, isn't it?
[103:24.06]Or is it?
[103:24.50]I don't know.
[103:24.88]I'm not sure.
[103:29.33]I don't know.
[103:35.31]Stop influencing me.
[103:40.49]It's like a social media thing.
[103:44.44]It's social media dog shit.
[103:48.79]How many Instagram followers do you have?
[103:50.41]How many Twitter followers do you have?
[103:52.25]How much spread do you have?
[103:53.73]How many people, when you make a tweet, do you see?
[103:56.24]What are your analytics on YouTube?
[103:58.66]Do you have a Snapchat?
[103:59.82]Monetize that, too!
[104:01.08]How many people are watching?
[104:06.58]Oh, he needs to be touched!
[104:08.06]Touch him!
[104:26.64]I'm so influenced I'm starting to get scared.
[104:30.52]I'm so influenced.
[104:39.99]Hot Friggles?
[104:42.21]Thanks, dude.
[104:43.61]I wonder if I can sneak this in here.
[104:46.04]Oh, shit.
[104:46.94]Abort.
[104:49.58]I told you I should have aborted.
[104:50.52]I told you I should have aborted.
[104:55.70]But thanks, Hot Friggles.
[104:58.14]Um, are you links?
[104:59.00]Are you linksing for six months?
[105:00.54]I think I got everybody.
[105:01.84]Did I?
[105:06.38]Who knows?
[105:07.14]Did $3,000 calm you down?
[105:08.02]No.
[105:08.36]Nothing calms me down.
[105:10.47]I'm at 100% at all times, you guys.
[105:20.13]Oh, somebody hurt him.
[105:20.83]Shit.
[105:23.45]That guy's getting me.
[105:31.47]And like I said, I'm old.
[105:32.91]I'm fucking 30.
[105:35.35]Maybe I just don't get it, you know?
[105:42.44]Jeremy influencing us to hate other influencing us, so only he can influence us.
[105:47.93]I know!
[105:48.69]It's fucked!
[105:50.69]It's a whole, it's the whole thing is fucking all over the place, isn't it?
[105:59.95]I just don't want to be called an influencer.
[106:02.45]And everybody seems to be okay with it for some reason.
[106:08.21]Oh, headshot.
[106:14.98]It's so much easier to shoot people like this.
[106:16.98]I wish I could just, like, have this through the game.
[106:21.20]Dirty as young, you influencer.
[106:31.48]That's why I don't do sponsorships.
[106:34.20]I don't do, like, paid videos.
[106:35.90]I don't do paid streams.
[106:37.02]I don't do anything paid.
[106:38.10]That's why I don't do it.
[106:49.51]Slinga.
[106:50.81]Slinga Max.
[106:51.99]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[106:52.81]You can call me whatever you want.
[106:58.66]You call me a shithead, that's fine.
[107:00.62]God, it doesn't matter.
[107:01.38]You're entitled to anything you want to say.
[107:03.86]As long as it's, uh... You know, abides by the Twitch rules.
[107:15.45]He almost killed me.
[107:16.43]In fact, he is gonna kill me.
[107:22.91]Fuck.
[107:23.29]Do we have a healer?
[107:25.01]Shit.
[107:31.41]Am I calling out Star?
[107:33.48]No, Star's not getting paid to say anything.
[107:38.28]Star's not like, I'm going to review Loot Crate.
[107:42.98]By the way, why the fuck does everybody have that?
[107:44.60]Okay, here we go.
[107:45.60]Here he goes again.
[107:47.12]Here he goes again.
[107:50.78]Here he goes again.
[107:51.44]I gotta be stopped here.
[107:56.14]I'm gonna keep talking shit.
[107:59.12]I'm gonna get myself in trouble.
[108:15.97]That looked like it really hurt.
[108:18.63]That hurt so bad that I died.
[108:22.26]I guess isn't that kind of what happens when you get hurt real bad?
[108:31.12]Get off your soapbox.
[108:32.80]No, I'm putting another... I'm putting... I'm taking all the soap out of a second box and putting another one on and standing on it.
[108:45.57]Oh, he's so close.
[108:48.93]Oh, fuck it!
[108:49.99]Fuck it!
[108:57.58]Ugh!
[109:01.72]Damn it!
[109:02.72]Damn it!
[109:10.59]He's climbing the walls.
[109:26.22]I'm saying a lot of oohs.
[109:27.10]We have two McCrees.
[109:30.72]We're the worst.
[109:35.01]She's so skinny.
[109:39.79]Hey everybody, sign up for Loot Crate and you can have your own t-shirt where we mash up Power Rangers in My Little Pony.
[109:46.43]What are you gonna do with all that stuff?
[109:48.61]What are you gonna do with it?
[109:49.41]Alright, here we go.
[109:51.71]Here we go.
[109:52.11]Ahem.
[109:55.40]After like six months of Loot Crate, what do you do with all that stuff?
[110:00.18]You're gonna have a closet that's dedicated to stuff you got out of this fucking random box.
[110:05.65]And like 12 t-shirts you don't wear.
[110:17.92]After like a couple years of Loot Crate...
[110:21.30]You're going to take your hand and drag it across your desk and have a trash bag open on the other side and put it in a fucking closet.
[110:28.70]How much desk space do you have?
[110:33.93]I understand the knee.
[110:35.01]Okay, cool.
[110:35.81]We got a couple of bobblehead pop head figures, but when you have 16 of them, they're on your desk.
[110:44.29]What are you going to do?
[110:57.71]It should be random.
[110:59.61]Now a box where it was random shit.
[111:02.69]I think I've talked about this before, but imagine a box where you paid and everybody gets the same shit.
[111:07.82]In Loot Crate.
[111:08.44]In like all those different box subscription monthly things.
[111:11.30]What about a box?
[111:12.04]What about a fucking UK?
[111:13.34]Here you go.
[111:13.96]Thanks.
[111:14.16]Somebody go make a billion dollars.
[111:15.56]Here's your billion dollar idea.
[111:16.62]Just send me a check for like 5% when you get the whole thing up and running.
[111:21.78]A box that you open like this, right?
[111:23.66]It's like, okay, you've got a box.
[111:25.18]Open it up.
[111:25.60]What's in it?
[111:26.78]Okay, mine has a bottle cap, fucking two Twizzlers, and like a Mega Man sticker.
[111:36.21]Okay, the guy down the street that has the same service got like a stack of gold bars in his, and it's worth like fucking 20 grand.
[111:44.29]Like he opens up his fucking loot box, and there's gold bars in it.
[111:49.86]Like, it would just be crazy random shit.
[111:51.75]Like, there'd be fucking... There'd be gold bars.
[111:53.89]You know what I'm saying?
[112:00.95]And at some point, you know, the next month, maybe there's like a fucking... Like, I don't know, something cool.
[112:09.48]There's like a fucking... Like, oh, this one has... There's a Nerf gun in here.
[112:12.92]Oh, what's underneath the Nerf gun?
[112:14.04]Oh, yeah, I got like sterling silver.
[112:21.16]Or like, I got this rare thing that nobody else is gonna have.
[112:26.49]I got a t-shirt in mind, but guess what?
[112:28.37]There's only one of them.
[112:30.25]There's only one of them that's ever- I got the one that- the only one.
[112:33.37]And it's fucking, like, a bright yellow mustard shirt with a big, like, weird face on it.
[112:38.02]And it's like, this is the only one that was made.
[112:45.59]This is the lottery you're proposing.
[112:47.05]It's literally just the lottery.
[112:48.95]No, not necessarily, because you open a fucking box.
[112:51.94]You're opening a box.
[112:53.08]This is the lottery.
[112:55.08]You could say that's the lottery for everything else, but these are wildly popular.
[112:59.46]Unbox the right to vote?
[113:02.02]What?
[113:04.50]Yeah, like Ronnie said, like, maybe you open up your box and there's, like, fucking Preparation H. And, like, two jars of mayonnaise.
[113:15.52]But somebody might have, like, oh, and here's, like, two tickets to, like, the Led Zeppelin concert.
[113:20.27]Front row seats.
[113:21.77]In, like, your town.
[113:25.55]Like, holy shit.
[113:26.33]I don't even, like, want to go to this concert.
[113:28.05]But that's pretty cool.
[113:29.47]I got, like, two fucking front row Led Zeppelin concert tickets.
[113:35.79]That's a box I would probably buy.
[113:37.27]Traveling to Nepal.
[113:49.74]Lottery.
[113:50.82]Yeah, but the lottery's boring.
[113:52.00]Lottery is you pay money to hope to make money.
[113:55.23]This one, you might get a fucking stick of Philadelphia cream cheese, but you also might get a gold bar.
[114:01.03]Like a... That's not money, that's a bar of gold.
[114:03.90]Would you even... What would you do with it?
[114:05.44]Who knows?
[114:05.78]What the fuck would you do with that?
[114:09.59]How would you feel when you paid 20 bucks for a jar of mayonnaise?
[114:11.59]I don't know, how do you feel... How do you feel when you unboxed, like, a hundred TF2 crates?
[114:15.91]And you got, like, 90 strange extinguishers?
[114:19.25]Same thing?
[114:22.55]Isn't that kind of the same thing?
[114:23.77]Alright, let's... We keep going from, like... Different, like... Anger to other... Anger.
[114:35.28]Can we talk about... Do I like anything?
[114:37.12]Let's see if I like anything.
[114:39.57]First, let me, uh, let me first, let me first, excuse me.
[114:41.75]Excuse me, guys.
[114:42.23]I'm gonna, I'm gonna say some names for a minute here.
[114:46.23]Uh, no soup for you.
[114:47.09]Thanks for five months.
[114:47.94]Datman Dunn, thanks for your subscription.
[114:49.86]Colonel, Colonel Zaff for two months.
[114:53.06]Frazboy for three months.
[114:55.34]Clayman for five months, and I believe that's it.
[115:02.17]I feel like I've been on, like, a fucking 45-minute tirade.
[115:06.91]I think I have.
[115:09.39]Alright, I'll show you some real fucking game skills.
[115:16.10]Quick finger, a little too quick for you, Roadhog.
[115:23.58]Throw the chain.
[115:24.58]Throw it.
[115:26.94]Ooh, went right through my body.
[115:28.78]Come find me over here.
[115:29.70]There's a guy over this way.
[115:41.02]Continue the tirade.
[115:44.44]Career ending tirade.
[115:48.71]I don't care.
[115:49.37]It's just Game of Thrones, guys.
[115:56.03]That's all it is.
[116:04.11]It's just Game of Thrones.
[116:12.57]Throw it at me.
[116:21.19]What?
[116:22.41]No fucking way.
[116:27.47]So long, Mr. Champ.
[116:28.79]Welcome back for six months.
[116:36.68]You're a bastard, Jon Snow.
[116:40.97]You take a Dr. Pepper sponsorship if they approached you?
[116:43.45]Not really.
[116:47.00]It's more of a running gag than it is a real thing.
[116:49.28]Just watch this.
[116:51.82]I'll show you a running gag.
[116:54.58]I'll show you a running gag.
[116:57.08]Sneak in there like this.
[117:02.96]Got Seffy.
[117:03.49]That's the guy I was looking for.
[117:19.41]Got them all.
[117:21.09]I got them all.
[117:24.94]See ya.
[117:27.06]I'm gonna set my ult again.
[117:32.52]Hey, Jethro Masters.
[117:37.04]Welcome.
[117:37.42]Thank you.
[117:41.89]Dr. Outgar.
[117:47.29]Alright, if actual Dr. Oatker approached me, it would have to be the real Dr. Oatker.
[117:52.75]It couldn't be like a marketing HR person.
[117:55.23]It's gotta be a real Dr. Oatker.
[118:01.43]It comes on the stream.
[118:10.55]Really?
[118:11.11]I'll do that to you.
[118:12.39]See, doesn't it suck when you get punched in the head?
[118:19.70]How do I only have seven?
[118:20.59]I feel like I've killed like 60 people.
[118:22.87]I only have seven eliminations.
[118:27.83]Oh, shit.
[118:28.13]Where'd he go?
[118:33.71]Fuck!
[118:39.92]Paul Barrow.
[118:43.16]Wait, what?
[118:48.67]Dr. Okura is fucking dead.
[118:50.17]So?
[118:54.79]Where do things have happened?
[119:02.14]Don't!
[119:03.06]That wasn't quick enough.
[119:03.98]We lost.
[119:17.66]Come on.
[119:18.96]Get to the edge.
[119:19.68]No.
[119:24.37]What the fuck was that?
[119:25.21]Have you ever thought about being on the co-optional podcast?
[119:34.17]Have you ever been contacted to do so?
[119:35.93]No.
[119:38.30]I don't know what I'd even do on there.
[119:40.80]I'd start talking about influencers and fucking candy.
[119:43.98]And they'd just boot me.
[119:48.69]I'd start talking about, like, fucking Dr. Roker's pizza, and, like, TotalBiscuit would be like, can we get this fucking guy out of here?
[119:54.95]This guy's fucked.
[119:59.39]Although it might be fun just to hear TotalBiscuit say, like, my god, this guy's fucked.
[120:16.10]Repositioning.
[120:21.47]I need like Raiden solo right now.
[120:28.86]What?
[120:30.10]I was inside of him.
[120:38.53]TB would be a complete agreeance on you on the Influencer thing.
[120:42.59]I don't want to put words in his mouth.
[120:47.37]But... I don't know.
[120:49.99]Maybe.
[120:55.23]Oh, shit.
[120:58.21]Reaper's not a pick here.
[120:59.59]Reaper's not a good pick here.
[121:01.03]Hey, amen.
[121:09.28]Hey, amen ramen.
[121:11.22]Amen ramen.
[121:12.42]Thank you for two months.
[121:13.06]Crazy Carl, six months.
[121:15.00]Welcome to the both of you.
[121:17.16]Welcome.
[121:23.41]I want to do die, die, die one more time.
[121:25.21]That's all I want to do.
[121:29.55]Nice.
[121:30.09]Got him with the dragon.
[121:31.63]Just want to get up there and do it.
[121:33.83]Here's a good... No, no, no.
[121:35.68]Not a good opportunity because he's doing his pushback move.
[121:42.24]Wow.
[121:44.12]Y'all just came in here, didn't you?
[121:45.74]Should I do it?
[121:46.86]Should I do it?
[121:47.40]I'm just going to freak out.
[122:03.50]Anyone's better than JBL?
[122:07.14]What rank am I?
[122:07.74]62.
[122:10.38]My highest was 64.
[122:10.98]And then I lost it all.

[148:36.99]So what do you get?
[148:38.84]What was the play of the game?
[148:40.84]There actually is a play of the game.
[148:43.88]I hope it's, uh... Is it when I... Okay, hold on.
[148:53.09]It's when I score it on myself.
[148:57.83]Glad we get to see that again.
[148:58.87]Okay.
[149:05.62]You get five EXP.
[149:09.92]Alright, I want to do that again.
[149:15.06]Five interceptions.
[149:15.78]If I was playing football, I would be a god right now.
[149:22.85]Oh, I was playing football.
[149:24.49]Sorry, American football.
[149:26.07]Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[149:27.59]Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[149:31.21]Where's my fucking highlight?
[149:32.37]There we go.
[149:34.99]Let's see.
[149:37.71]Take a look at this highlight, baby.
[149:45.00]Yeah, those don't come very often.
[150:03.26]It's when I scout myself.
[150:07.76]Good highlight.
[150:15.62]I didn't do anything else that whole game.
[150:24.44]It was the same play.
[150:25.82]My highlight was that guy's highlight.
[150:28.84]I should have got... I should have got credit for that one.
[150:31.36]Not him.
[150:31.82]This fucking... This game sucks.
[150:42.44]Now I'm not fucking around.
[150:44.66]WHAT?!
[150:47.26]Did you just let that happen?
[150:49.04]Oh god.
[150:49.76]That was like, just rolled right in.
[150:52.72]Oh god.
[151:00.45]Oh no.
[151:02.31]We have to do that to them.
[151:09.27]Just fucking freak out.
[151:13.93]Off the wall.
[151:14.27]Here it comes.
[151:14.77]It's going to come back here.
[151:17.09]Boom.
[151:18.71]It's going to slinky over here.
[151:20.29]It's going to bounce back to me.
[151:21.91]Fake him out.
[151:23.33]Off the wall.
[151:24.01]Fake him out again.
[151:25.56]Bounce it back.
[151:26.10]Go.
[151:32.62]Told you.
[151:34.50]Told you.
[151:34.92]Oh.
[151:34.98]Oh.
[151:41.25]Are you fucking kidding me?
[151:42.11]Are you like a professional Lúcio ball player?
[151:44.00]Oh fuck!
[151:57.36]Get it in!
[151:58.22]Get it in!
[151:59.42]Get it in!
[152:01.08]Are you serious dude?
[152:03.04]This guy is fucking crazy!
[152:08.43]How the fuck are you saving all these?
[152:19.48]Bounce it back here.
[152:22.92]I'm just gonna wait here.
[152:23.54]I'm gonna do the thing that I used to do in Mega Man Soccer.
[152:25.40]Just watch.
[152:26.84]Remember Mega Man Soccer?
[152:27.84]This is how you always fucking won the game.
[152:30.96]You just waited for it to come to you and you just turned and did your super power move like that.
[152:35.34]I missed.
[152:35.60]It's okay.
[152:35.94]I'll get it this time.
[152:40.48]Come on.
[152:40.74]Shoot it over here.
[152:41.40]No one's doing what I'm doing.
[152:42.74]I'm playing the actual game that you're supposed to play.
[152:47.46]I fucking missed again.
[152:50.24]I'll get it.
[152:51.30]No one's paying any attention to this.
[152:52.52]I will eventually get this.
[152:53.90]It just rolled right to fucking... There's two guys down there.
[153:00.87]Those guys are like... Those guys are like high-fiving each other.
[153:10.32]I've gotta get that.
[153:11.84]I've gotta get it.
[153:13.86]I'll wait for him to make the first move.
[153:17.90]Wow.
[153:19.20]How did we all fuck that up?
[153:27.89]I don't know.
[153:29.23]How did we just let that fucking happen?
[153:38.64]Goalie's coming out.
[153:39.58]Fuck it.
[153:39.88]We're down by so much.
[153:52.26]How does it keep happening?
[153:55.78]What the fuck?
[154:00.12]I'm gonna get a goal.
[154:06.19]Not this time.
[154:08.97]Suck it to me.
[154:09.81]Suck it over here.
[154:12.45]Yeah.
[154:12.97]We didn't instantly lose.
[154:14.31]If I get one goal, our team wins.
[154:16.51]That's how it works.
[154:22.95]There it is.
[154:23.65]It's gonna go over his head.
[154:31.35]Okay, I'm just staying in the fucking goal.
[154:33.67]I'm gonna stand in the goal.
[154:39.23]One of their players was our goalie.
[154:43.27]How does that work?
[154:46.55]One of their players was standing in our goal.
[154:59.57]Come on.
[155:00.21]Roll it in there.
[155:01.77]Sneak it in.
[155:05.12]What is it doing?
[155:05.90]That's the...
[155:23.38]Should I just go in the goal?
[155:24.74]I'm just gonna go in the goal.
[155:26.46]I'm standing here.
[155:27.12]We need like two goalies.
[155:33.87]I almost lost it too.
[155:36.19]Almost lost it.
[155:38.35]Magically.
[155:38.89]This is not fair.
[155:45.15]These guys are working together.
[155:46.37]These guys are like cued together.
[156:08.37]Oh, shit.
[156:09.59]Get it out of the way.
[156:10.33]Don't let them do their fucking double team move.
[156:13.55]Yeah, you know what?
[156:14.23]Get the fuck out of here.
[156:17.07]That's what happens.
[156:18.32]That's not happening anymore.
[156:20.12]I can promise you that.
[156:20.96]Yeah, get out of here.
[156:23.54]You should take damage if you're in there.
[156:34.07]Waiting for him.
[156:34.59]I'm waiting for this guy to just get out of here.
[156:40.62]That's two saves.
[156:43.60]I'll take a third save.
[156:46.14]Why don't we make it four?
[156:47.44]Come on.
[156:52.06]Yeah, we get one goal.
[156:55.68]We beat the spread.
[156:56.82]We actually beat the spread guys.
[157:02.53]Got one.
[157:04.29]We actually got one.
[157:06.50]Look at all these gold medals.
[157:09.44]I had to let him have them.
[157:11.60]I just gotta get one gold and I'll have all gold medals.
[157:14.16]I gotta do it.
[157:18.80]Shit, that didn't hit it?
[157:19.46]This guy's dancing.
[157:21.87]That guy's dancing.
[157:22.89]You guys saw it here.
[157:23.51]You guys saw it on stream.
[157:24.25]That guy was just dancing.
[157:24.91]That guy wasn't playing the game.
[157:30.73]Oh well.
[157:32.96]That guy has a skin.
[157:41.15]They seriously have that as an intro and he has to play the game here?
[157:50.25]No, there's his giant crock pot shot.
[158:02.28]Let's see.
[158:02.62]Let's see what I did there.
[158:04.94]Let's take a look.
[158:06.28]Let's see what I did that game.
[158:13.51]Nice.
[158:19.61]See, I got him out.
[158:21.33]Nice play of the game.
[158:22.27]That's what I'll say.
[158:22.87]I'm going to play one more game.
[158:32.38]I'm just regular.
[158:33.44]I'm going to play one more game and then be out of here.
[158:36.24]Get back to the ramen video where I just eat ramen for 30 minutes.
[158:47.85]I actually am curious how long it's going to be.
[158:52.91]I don't think it's going to be longer than 30 minutes, but I don't know.
[158:55.37]It might not even be longer than 20.
[158:57.42]I don't know.
[158:59.42]Still in the process of putting it together.
[159:11.58]Have I really been streaming for like three hours?
[159:14.09]That seems like not real.
[159:16.89]Well, whatever.
[159:19.57]This will be the last one.
[159:23.95]The special video is ramen?
[159:25.27]No.
[159:28.51]That's the joke.
[159:29.59]That's the joke what the video is.
[159:48.04]I'm yawning.
[159:48.90]That's not good.
[159:49.78]I need to do more things on this video.
[159:53.13]I don't want to go to bed.
[159:54.07]What time is it?
[159:56.17]What time is it Eastern right now?
[159:58.17]What's the ETA on the video?
[159:59.77]I would say next week.
[160:03.26]Like the week of the 18th?
[160:04.70]20th or something?
[160:09.70]I'm hoping it's uploaded and on the channel and live and public by the very latest, the end of August.
[160:19.03]By the very latest.
[160:21.61]It's definitely not going to take that long.
[160:24.67]I would assume within the next 7 to 14 days it will be on the channel and public and live.
[160:33.37]Unless, of course, something happens.
[160:34.87]Which I don't think will.
[160:36.65]I think I'm just trucking away at it.
[160:39.09]Should be fine.
[160:41.75]I'm sorry, fellow Lúcio baller.
[160:43.23]I'm a terrible Lúcio.
[160:45.47]No, it's alright.
[160:46.23]It was fun.
[160:47.25]It was fun.
[160:52.96]It was a good time.
[160:57.10]I died.
[161:01.38]Nice pull.
[161:02.00]Holy shit.
[161:02.64]Good job.
[161:11.00]I'm not going to let you just kill me, because you probably will.
[161:21.04]We don't have a healer, do we?
[161:22.02]No, we... Shit.
[161:32.13]Oh!
[161:33.27]Whoa!
[161:35.46]What?
[161:36.38]Holy fuck.
[161:39.08]Actually, my body hurts.
[161:44.92]I didn't even know they had a Widowmaker.
[161:46.89]I wasn't even paying attention.
[161:49.65]I'm going to have to play healer.
[161:54.05]Like Mercy or something.
[161:57.03]No, now we have a Lúcio.
[161:57.89]Whatever.
[162:07.81]Stay alive.
[162:09.35]No.
[162:10.49]No.
[162:12.47]Oh, no.
[162:19.61]Fuck.
[162:22.09]Oh, my goodness.
[162:27.98]Hey, happy pants.
[162:29.78]Welcome back for three months.
[162:31.80]The happiest of all pants.
[162:39.81]Alright, now I actually have my bearings.
[162:44.06]Wow, that's a... Whoa.
[162:46.78]Wow.
[162:47.30]What?
[162:49.34]What?
[162:50.12]What?
[162:50.92]What?
[163:06.88]Now what?
[163:10.00]I'm just going for melee kills.
[163:10.98]I'm just gonna fucking melee this Mercy.
[163:16.18]What?
[163:26.57]Wait, what?
[163:29.81]That one didn't count.
[163:31.91]Hey, Jeremy90850.
[163:36.23]Thanks for four months, dude.
[163:51.16]Good melee.
[163:52.44]Good melee.
[164:00.85]That one didn't count.
[164:04.88]It just didn't count.
[164:07.25]I didn't even get to play the game.
[164:08.99]I walked out of spawn, realized we had no healer, died, and then died three times his mercy instantly.
[164:13.99]But it didn't count.
[164:28.43]Steamrolled LOL banned that guy for life.
[164:35.64]That guy gets a double life sentence ban.
[164:40.92]We're talking at least six fucking seconds.
[164:45.35]Lennox, thanks for ten months.
[164:46.25]Dude, there's a ten-monther.
[164:47.67]Ten fucking months.
[164:49.81]Yikes.
[164:57.86]It's a long time.
[165:01.74]Someone needs to improve their technique.
[165:08.78]Somebody said Zenyatta.
[165:09.56]I'm going to play Zenyatta.
[165:11.96]If you can't beat him, ban him.
[165:15.58]Six seconds.
[165:16.66]That's like an eternity in goldfish years.
[165:21.17]Goldfish lives like two years, right?
[165:25.91]So like ten seconds is how long for a goldfish to humans.
[165:30.91]Because we could start calling it goldfish.
[165:32.55]Like goldfish ban that guy.
[165:33.72]What?
[165:37.01]Hey, Glow.
[165:37.77]Glowrels.
[165:38.44]Glorels.
[165:39.26]Glorellas.
[165:40.00]Glorels.
[165:42.50]Thanks for being the best streamer.
[165:43.36]Aw, thank you.
[165:44.82]I don't think I'm the best streamer.
[165:46.98]Appreciate the encouragement, though.
[165:49.22]Very much so.
[165:50.94]Yeah, so, like, ten seconds for a goldfish is how long for a human.
[165:54.95]Like, both, you know...
[165:59.22]If you're talking about like an average human lives to be like... Like 80.
[166:03.10]Right?
[166:05.34]And a goldfish lives to be like 2.
[166:06.56]That's probably like at least 10 minutes.
[166:13.31]Right?
[166:19.73]Holy shit.
[166:26.68]Bird lady up.
[166:28.18]Phoenix lady up top.
[166:38.11]Fuck.
[166:43.35]Really?
[166:44.53]Really?
[166:46.03]Really?
[166:48.77]Steal this.
[166:50.03]What?
[166:53.40]What the fuck just happened to me?
[166:55.57]She like threw acid at my ass.
[166:57.93]And it killed me.
[167:00.45]I can't believe I just got a jar of fucking jello thrown at me and it killed me.
[167:06.83]Eleven goldfish years?
[167:13.41]Oh, hello.
[167:15.31]Wow, that killed everybody.
[167:32.61]That's 6 minutes and 40 seconds.
[167:38.71]Alright, so if you get a 6 minute ban... Like, if you get a 6 minute ban, you got a goldfish ban.
[167:46.81]Say anything about the book, uh... That's not the big project.
[167:51.54]That's what I'll say about it.
[167:55.24]Fuck, I could've hit Q, but I just instantly died.
[167:59.94]Um...
[168:02.33]I told you, like, the book is that, like, little novel choose-your-own-adventure thing.
[168:07.27]It's kind of what I do for, like, therapy.
[168:12.39]It kind of just takes me away from everything, and I just write, like, a couple pages.
[168:17.71]At this point, it's more of just, like, a...
[168:30.00]Stay near me.
[168:31.92]Stay near me.
[168:42.06]Where's bird lady?
[168:48.19]Come here, bird lady.
[168:50.77]Bird lady.
[168:57.51]I knew somebody should have fucking kept their eye on the bird lady.
[169:01.58]But thank you Hepbur, Hepbur, for your subscription, welcome.
[169:20.12]He's still back there.
[169:35.38]God I knew something I knew somebody was but deal with the fucking pig man I'm gonna change after I do my old There don't you die
[170:02.63]I think he wants to do his ult.
[170:04.43]That's what it sounds like to me.
[170:10.75]I think that's what's going to happen here.
[170:12.77]Oh!
[170:15.33]Whoa!
[170:43.17]Too many things!
[170:45.37]Too many things!
[170:53.57]Fucking die!
[170:54.53]I almost had my ult again!
[170:59.64]Shit!
[171:04.08]It would have been crazy if I got my ult again.
[171:06.14]But I don't think we won.
[171:07.10]Nope.
[171:14.65]Nah, there's just too much going on there.
[171:17.03]How do I have 80?
[171:17.86]Okay.
[171:19.12]Dude, I think I got, like, I got, like, this, like, the top of my head just, like, hurts.
[171:30.97]I'm gonna have, like, a fucking rash.
[171:32.85]Uh...
[171:49.09]I get to be the Joker.
[171:49.97]Let's go.
[172:07.08]Hey.
[172:09.18]Oh, shit.
[172:09.86]Didn't want to do that.
[172:10.48]I'm going to move down there.
[172:20.50]Hello, Anna.
[172:26.87]Oh, it's stepping it.
[172:28.07]Stepping it.
[172:39.38]Damn it.
[172:42.02]Junkrat is a better joker than the joker.
[172:56.13]No, no, I did it too early.
[172:58.15]I knew it.
[172:59.17]It's alright.
[173:00.11]I get a second chance to jump over to that one.
[173:11.98]Don't let her get the fucking health.
[173:13.70]Shit.
[173:32.58]Oh, she's so little.
[173:34.16]She's the teeniest, tiniest little thing.
[173:48.37]Mark Hamill's Joker, yeah.
[173:49.47]Mark Hamill is always a great Joker.
[173:58.79]Oh, Jared Leto.
[174:07.93]What the fuck?
[174:14.76]Oh, no.
[174:24.62]Oh, no.
[174:34.75]Oh, I got her in the air.
[174:42.81]Shit, you slept me.
[174:50.59]Get that dragon in there.
[174:59.27]Oh, things are looking... Get me the fuck out of that room.
[175:06.88]I'm serious.
[175:08.56]Step in the other one.
[175:13.93]This is just carnage.
[175:14.91]Speaking of carnage, I wish we'd see a... I wish we'd see a carnage movie.
[175:23.66]With carnage in it, like a Venom and Carnage movie.
[175:28.06]That would sure be swell.
[175:29.10]Did you just eat it?
[175:34.53]She just actually ate that.
[175:35.87]Gosh darn it.
[175:40.14]Don't let the characters fucking do it!
[175:42.10]What happened?
[175:42.54]I just ripped off a piece of my chair.
[176:00.47]Danny DeVito Joker?
[176:01.53]That actually would be pretty cool.
[176:07.57]I think Michael Keaton would be a great carnage.
[176:16.75]Wait, what?
[176:18.85]Yo, Merry Christmas.
[176:19.97]Merry Christmas to you too, ZapdvozDelicious.
[176:26.09]And a happy six months being subscribed to this Twitch channel.
[176:34.12]Oh, fucking Harvey Dent.
[176:35.12]Harvey Two-Face.
[176:35.80]Harvey Dent.
[176:39.42]Vote Dent.
[176:53.92]Woo!

[179:16.56]Oh, come on.
[179:16.90]There's got to be a Roadhog over in the sneak spot.
[179:20.20]Of course there's a Roadhog over in the sneak spot.
[179:31.89]Come on.
[179:32.31]I've got to go out on a win.
