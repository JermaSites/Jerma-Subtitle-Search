[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.15]Today,
[00:27.36]Continuing from yesterday.
[00:29.42]We are going to play... The... Part 3.
[00:35.48]Or is it Part 4?
[00:36.62]I don't even know.
[00:39.18]Of the FMVs.
[00:39.88]This is like Part 5.
[00:43.12]We've done a lot of them.
[00:45.43]We may see the end of the FMVs tonight.
[00:50.27]It's possible.
[00:50.95]Depends on if this first one is the only real substantial FMV video game that I have left.
[01:02.03]There aren't any more after this that are substantial.
[01:08.65]I still have a couple of other fucking stupid ones, but, you know.
[01:15.29]And coming up next is the carnival.
[01:17.85]No, that's next week.
[01:24.10]What would you do if I just turned off the intro?
[01:28.80]Then there was a carnival behind me.
[01:32.01]I pulled it forward a week.
[01:34.17]I feel like people would be very upset about that.
[01:41.21]Jerma, what the hell are you doing?
[01:43.15]I took off work on the 21st to watch this.
[01:47.25]Oh, shit.
[01:47.81]Sorry.
[01:51.83]But, no.
[01:52.41]The first thing I'm going to do is called Fox Hunt.
[01:56.31]This is a game made, I think, by Capcom.
[01:59.59]I think this was on the PS1 as well.
[02:08.76]Maybe.
[02:09.84]I'm not 100% sure.
[02:13.91]But, I got it ready.
[02:16.63]It's just open.
[02:19.23]Do you guys want to go?
[02:20.53]Do you want to see it?
[02:25.05]You want to see this one?
[02:28.44]No?
[02:28.74]Oh, alright.
[02:32.14]Okay, we don't have to.
[02:33.68]Alright.
[02:39.22]We can sit here.
[02:46.82]Alright.
[02:49.66]Do you want me to turn the stream off?
[02:51.02]Do you want me to just go?
[02:53.42]Should I go?
[02:53.82]Do you want me... Should I leave?
[02:57.11]Alright.
[03:03.65]Foxhut.
[03:04.05]There it is.
[03:04.35]I don't know what to expect, although I... How can you expect anything with these games?
[03:12.20]They're all a fucking mess.
[03:14.22]It is a Capcom game.
[03:16.67]There's the logo, the original Capcom logo.
[03:18.92]That's how you know it's going to be good.
[03:21.22]Here we go.
[03:22.58]Let's get a good countdown here.
[03:24.14]One.
[03:47.44]Why does every James Bond movie and every wannabe James Bond movie have a skiing scene?
[03:55.10]What?
[03:55.42]Is anybody getting any of this?
[03:57.36]Why are this guy's hands all burned?
[04:23.36]We made it there, turkey.
[04:35.89]I know they're speaking English, but I can't understand them.
[04:40.70]Oh, now we're cooking with gas.
[05:03.00]Priest falls for school teacher, but got amnesia.
[05:07.38]Something with the teacher that has amnesia?
[05:09.04]Can't remember she used to be stripper.
[05:12.71]What?
[05:13.23]Don't go to ball.
[05:16.61]Nice suit.
[05:20.35]What?
[05:21.05]Why does this guy have Mickey Mouse gloves on?
[05:23.09]I don't understand why he's wearing those.
[05:24.91]Nice shirt.
[05:25.41]Welcome, Donald.
[05:27.01]By the way, yes, I've set the launch in 36 hours.
[05:29.89]Bozo.
[05:41.11]and there was a briefcase switch.
[05:57.31]These are agents, and there's the CD.
[06:02.07]This is not exactly less stuff for the butchers.
[06:06.08]What the fuck is happening?
[06:36.20]And to prove I am not a loyal capitalist, you will also pay $100 million cash for disk feed launch abort codes.
[06:44.30]Idiot.
[06:45.66]Moron.
[06:47.24]Who is he talking to?
[06:48.44]Don't kill him.
[06:49.36]He still has disk.
[06:54.22]What?
[06:55.77]I have no idea.
[06:57.65]That's not me.
[06:58.73]This is me.
[07:04.63]Was that a TV show thing?
[07:08.04]I might have just been making that up in my head.
[07:18.44]Alright, reading a book.
[07:19.42]That's not a book.
[07:20.66]Oh, I just got so much worse.
[07:59.16]The pacing here is kinda- is sort of just way off.
[08:04.36]So there's a Russian agent who's going to want a hundred million dollars or- Oh, we have access to- wait.
[08:22.35]Okay, I like the control.
[08:24.16]Controlling is fun.
[08:27.08]Computer.
[08:30.34]That's it.
[08:31.56]I just press W. No, it's S. Okay.
[08:36.57]S is... I don't know how to turn the computer on.
[08:41.95]How about the lamp?
[08:43.33]How about the phone?
[08:47.14]Oh
[09:06.50]Is that supposed to be a... Is that, like, a friend?
[09:10.35]Is that... Hey, Jack, Freeloader.
[09:12.87]I'm in Fremont.
[09:14.17]I know you're there.
[09:15.25]I can hear you whimpering.
[09:16.73]Pay up, Mr. Fremont.
[09:18.24]Borrow it from your folks if you have to, because I'm going to be in touch if your phone is still connected.
[09:25.58]Fremont out there.
[09:29.61]Jack, darling, which is nicer?
[09:31.35]Your baby brother's new Mercedes or your sister's new Lexus?
[09:34.84]Anyway, I hope all is well.
[09:36.68]I love you.
[09:37.20]Call your mother.
[09:38.10]You know, if they paid for watching reruns, our eldest son would be a millionaire.
[09:42.86]Hang up.
[09:47.44]Okay.
[09:50.68]Sure.
[09:50.96]We had the skiing thing in the beginning.
[09:56.86]How do we leave the house?
[10:02.22]TV?
[10:02.78]No, why do I have a backpack on?
[10:05.64]How do I get the backpack?
[10:13.36]What the fuck?
[10:21.09]So open the fridge and eat from the fridge.
[10:32.12]Am I doing this wrong?
[10:33.06]Do I have to touch the latch?
[10:34.76]Alright.
[10:37.56]What do you do?
[10:39.30]Ah, easy.
[10:39.90]It is.
[10:40.94]I'M HUNGRY!
[11:07.69]Okay.
[11:14.39]Rob Lowe is apparently in this game.
[11:19.09]Unpaid bill.
[11:20.01]You may already be a winner.
[11:35.41]What?
[11:35.99]I have no idea what the fuck he's talking about.
[11:46.36]About the window?
[11:48.60]What about the pans?
[12:01.15]No, look over here.
[12:04.39]Tacos?
[12:07.41]Is it Frisbee?
[12:07.83]I hate this.
[12:08.45]This is just like inside the apartment of like a creepy person.
[12:36.98]Just like a weirdo.
[12:47.16]What are you looking at?
[12:49.92]What is it?
[12:51.86]Every day on UVC?
[12:53.96]I can't read this.
[13:02.06]This is a Sim's house.
[13:06.25]It is.
[13:06.59]Even the way he's spinning, he's keyboard turning.
[13:19.58]How do I leave the house?
[13:27.07]Get me out of the fucking house.
[13:29.11]No, I'm not looking at it anymore like boobs, alright?
[13:33.17]Don't forget your keys.
[13:35.99]What does it say?
[13:36.61]He's breaking into the house.
[13:49.29]Why am I not paying attention to this guy?
[13:53.71]Your cup is mine.
[13:55.91]Why are they acting like this?
[13:59.52]This is just the principal from Billy Madison.
[14:18.20]Did you just kill me?
[14:48.37]What the fuck is happening?
[14:51.95]I'm pressing 1, 2, and 3.
[14:52.99]Don't do it!
[15:28.49]I had no idea what's going on.
[15:31.85]A guy broke into my house wearing a Donatello from the Ninja Turtles thing on his eyes.
[15:38.38]I made fun of him and then we had like a weird play fight and then he jumped out of my fourth story window.
[15:46.33]I don't have anything else to add to that.
[15:48.98]Live from Hollywood at 15 frames a second, it's time for Destiny TV's online game show extravaganza.
[15:58.07]Here's our first question for our players.
[16:01.79]What do you say, King?
[16:03.43]It's destiny time.
[16:10.41]Is this an internet cafe?
[16:13.28]What was the Batman's favorite snack?
[16:17.90]Tropical oil and lard sandwich.
[16:21.46]That's right!
[16:22.70]Tropical oil and lard.
[16:23.74]Who said?
[16:24.53]Mister, if I had legs, I'd kick your behind.
[16:32.81]Barry Blake as Nubs Parker, episode 16 of License to Mame.
[16:40.34]Am I the only one playing this game?
[16:45.62]Yeah, but he knows his TV.
[16:49.16]What?
[16:49.42]I walked into a bar.
[16:50.74]I'm the only person playing the fucking game.
[16:54.36]Don't fret none, Ma, but Jason, they poisoned our water, killed our cattle, and burnt down our house.
[17:05.31]Once again, our leader in California.
[17:19.44]So this is like, agents.
[17:25.81]I just got syringed!
[17:30.15]This goes up a full letter grade.
[17:31.85]This goes up two full letter grades.
[17:33.17]I got syringed in the neck.
[17:38.43]This was an F. It's now like a C-.
[17:40.25]Gonna be a horrible old banger with just a whisper of...
[17:49.26]Galeano.
[17:50.43]It's still an F. Not yet.
[17:52.87]That just went up two full letter grades.
[17:54.11]If you guys don't understand, a car is one, a syringe in the neck is two.
[18:01.30]Alright, so I just got syringed.
[18:02.34]Uh, I woke up.
[18:04.03]Let's see what's in this box.
[18:10.45]So he says all you have to do is the fakie-shakie and the ropes just fall off.
[18:14.53]He said that?
[18:15.33]Yeah.
[18:16.01]You know, put your right toe in, put your right toe out.
[18:19.51]You know, that one.
[18:20.29]Oh, that one.
[18:20.87]Yeah.
[18:21.49]You're an idiot.
[18:24.97]This is so unsettling.
[18:26.89]It is.
[18:27.45]It is unsettling.
[18:28.97]But I'm intrigued.
[18:30.35]Is that the Joker?
[18:39.55]Wait till they get a load of me.
[18:43.53]These are like Truman Show type stuff where he's making TV references every now and again.
[18:47.82]Open it.
[18:51.30]Alright, how do I... Here comes the fake stomachache.
[18:59.65]Let's do it.
[19:01.65]Wait, hold on.
[19:03.33]Boxes?
[19:03.67]Can I open them?
[19:07.87]Mm-hmm.
[19:10.26]Is he going in here?
[19:16.43]Flowers?
[19:17.01]Is it food?
[19:18.89]Cigars?
[19:21.35]That was pretty... That was pretty good.
[19:25.07]What?
[19:31.22]What else is in here?
[19:36.07]Oh, the classic.
[19:37.07]The classic.
[19:37.65]I don't know what this is.
[19:38.59]I'm gonna sneeze into it.
[19:39.85]I hope I don't get in any trouble.
[20:00.89]What about their computer?
[20:01.77]Can I turn on their computer?
[20:08.51]Yeah.
[20:13.58]No.
[20:18.50]This game was made by a fucking alien.
[20:26.31]No.
[20:26.71]Back, back up.
[20:27.13]I don't want to try to turn the computer on again.
[20:33.21]I'm hungry!
[20:34.37]He just starts smashing it.
[20:38.79]Anything else on the table?
[20:40.47]Not that I can see it.
[20:41.15]I think I have to do... Go back to the... Top secret.
[20:44.99]There it is.
[20:46.25]How the hell would I have ever found that?
[20:57.22]What?
[20:57.50]What?
[21:01.69]Come on!
[21:02.51]Come on!
[21:09.90]Give me the top secret thing!
[21:12.14]I just wanna- it says top secret, just give it to me.
[21:14.52]It's right here.
[21:17.34]Stop knocking stuff over and making like Jim Carrey faces and noises and shit and pick up the top secret data.
[21:24.43]Fine.
[21:33.94]Spies must wash hands before returning to work.
[21:36.14]Personal hygiene is no big secret.
[21:38.08]Alright, that's like, fine.
[21:39.74]Right, you know what I mean?
[21:45.94]There's more, they have more stuff in the... Okay, I stole the credit card out of here.
[21:56.02]Do I have an inventory?
[21:56.92]I don't think I even have an inventory.
[22:00.46]There's more- this guy has more shit in his pocket.
[22:03.08]Is that a sandwich?
[22:08.02]Why does this guy have so much stuff in his pockets?
[22:15.48]You got more stuff in here?
[22:24.55]Okay, so now we go back to the door.
[22:30.60]It's a spy weapon.
[22:31.78]Yeah, but what about... Where's my inventory?
[22:44.85]Nuclear missiles do's and don'ts.
[22:47.01]Nuclear missiles do's and don'ts.
[22:55.98]Well, at least I have a manual.
[22:58.92]Did I miss something else over here?
[23:05.14]No.
[23:05.30]Oh, here they come.
[23:06.48]I say he's bluffing.
[23:08.27]We can just call Washington and tell the director he's bluffing.
[23:11.17]Alright, spy weapon.
[23:12.45]This maniac also has the board goes to stop Los Angeles from becoming the world's largest barbecue pit.
[23:17.37]He wants his payback from his shows of the 70s, and now you want me to tell Langley that he's bluffing?
[23:22.02]Hello, Jack.
[23:25.50]I'm the dealer.
[23:26.64]I am the crew PA.
[23:28.18]And I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
[23:30.78]We apologize for the circumstances, Jack.
[23:34.07]We're CIA.
[23:35.19]After the end of the Cold War, we've had cutbacks.
[23:39.78]Serious cutbacks, Jack.
[23:41.84]We need you to deliver a briefcase in exchange for a package.
[23:45.50]Now, if you do this, we will deposit $100,000 in your bank account.
[23:52.31]It's not that much.
[23:53.27]Allen and Ellen, over here, Clint.
[23:56.47]Well, you know, um... That's Dr. Evil levels of under... I'm not a spy.
[24:00.51]We have reason to believe that the double agent has compromised our security and our identities.
[24:06.22]We don't need a spy, just... a guy.
[24:11.65]This is going to be dangerous.
[24:13.67]That sounds great, really.
[24:19.71]I can't believe my luck.
[24:21.86]But if I wanted to be filled with lead, I'd continue to paint off my bedroom walls.
[24:25.80]We'll give you $500 in advance.
[24:28.12]Cool.
[24:29.10]$500?
[24:29.12]$100,000?
[24:29.48]No, add a couple zeros.
[24:32.44]20 years ago, the Fox had a kid with one of those hot TV starlets.
[24:35.95]A girl.
[24:36.29]I wonder if she's cute.
[24:38.45]Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[24:41.39]This is fucking terrifying.
[24:42.62]This guy's terrifying.
[24:43.80]Where's the Patsy?
[24:44.48]Is this the president?
[24:46.16]Who's the president?
[24:47.44]Oh, dear.
[24:51.60]Here is your CD-ROM reader.
[24:53.38]You probably won't need it.
[24:54.42]Already got one.
[24:55.25]Not like this one, old boy.
[24:57.51]It'll play anything, including coded government discs from any country on Earth.
[25:02.47]Cool.
[25:04.17]MI5 has been looking for the wolf for over 30 years.
[25:07.37]For wolf.
[25:08.65]The coolest thing I could possibly fucking hand you.
[25:11.63]A non-region locked CD player.
[25:14.23]Wow.
[25:16.68]Unbelievable.
[25:18.04]Another cocktail?
[25:26.74]Oh yeah.
[25:30.04]Wise guy amateur.
[25:37.07]Uh-oh, it just went up another two letter grades.
[25:39.00]Is there one in my backpack?
[25:53.97]Okay.
[25:55.21]So, now, I still don't have an inventory, though.
[25:58.31]I think I just have this shit.
[25:59.45]Where's the credit card?
[26:12.86]That... Global Terminocular Threats.
[26:17.64]The Fox.
[26:18.74]Codename The Fox.
[26:20.96]H53.
[26:21.86]Ukraine.
[26:22.58]National origin.
[26:24.38]The King of Disinformation.
[26:25.40]The real name.
[26:26.92]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[26:27.83]Number one spy during the 70s and early 80s.
[26:30.53]Reisenfall's Partacular.
[26:31.53]Former film director.
[26:32.53]He was enlisted by the Soviet KGB to destroy America by polluting its communications network.
[26:38.03]During the 70s, he secretly created over half of all American television stories.
[26:43.01]Storylines and plots for episodes were sent anonymously to the networks, where executives took credit and made millions.
[26:49.99]The Fox was promoted to the rank of KGB colonel, and was eventually one of the only five men granted access to launch codes for Russia's nuclear arsenal.
[27:00.74]Interesting.
[27:14.67]Soviet's planned attempt to mesmerize America by sinking the level of entertainment so low that national morals and moral morale would also die was a terrible failure.
[27:24.99]The disinformation plan backfired, and eventually Russians desired the same subversive television.
[27:32.30]His work has been greatly credited for destroying communism worldwide.
[27:36.86]Rated extremely dangerous.
[27:38.10]Rumors abound that the Fox has stolen the launch codes for Russia's remaining nuclear missile.
[27:43.96]CIA contact made and broken codes may now be available on the internet for some reason.
[27:48.87]I thought I said on the internet.
[27:50.83]Codes may now be available on the internet on the international black market.
[27:54.31]Oh, that is what that is.
[27:57.39]I'm sorry, it's hard to read because...
[28:00.22]This is, like, in a small window on my screen, and I've blown it up on your screen.
[28:05.06]Because I'm trying... I have to squint to see this.
[28:11.38]Okay.
[28:12.20]Enter access code.
[28:20.59]Wait.
[28:21.15]These are all... Hold on.
[28:21.81]Wait, wait, wait.
[28:22.49]This is a mouse button.
[28:23.73]Look at all these fucking things.
[28:25.97]Look at this shit.
[28:31.72]Fast cars and... The chameleon is a former surfer dude turned spy for hire.
[28:37.71]Son of a former female KGB agent and a California surf bum.
[28:44.83]Favorite drink?
[28:45.39]Whiskey.
[28:46.13]Remember that.
[28:48.27]Bingo, extortionist, codename Bingo, age 32, from Montreal, self-employed, flower arranger, archery, ice sculpting.
[28:57.66]Bingo Magnum is an international gambler and extortionist who has vowed to finally earn the big score.
[29:03.37]Her goal is to obtain cash, precious metals, and negotiable securities.
[29:07.45]Young, beautiful, and deadly, Ms.
[29:09.11]Magnum is a university-educated mathematician with a photographic memory.
[29:13.49]Trained in her native Canada at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Academy in Ottawa.
[29:18.33]She disappeared from her job as an analyst in the anti-terrorist section and hooked up with members of the Quebec separatist movement.
[29:25.71]Okay.
[29:28.71]Extremely dangerous.
[29:29.73]Bingo.

[32:25.12]Are you there?
[32:25.58]Pick up, pick up, pick up!
[32:27.78]Oops, I forgot.
[32:28.84]It's the first of the month.
[32:29.75]That means you're not answering the phones.
[32:32.69]It's still the first of the month?
[32:33.89]Jack, I want my stuff back.
[32:35.85]Hey, Biffy Wiffy, turn off that video camera.
[32:39.01]Stop it some more.
[32:44.38]Always Aspen, okay.
[32:47.58]What's this?
[32:48.56]This is like the weird laptop iPad thing.
[33:03.50]The guy on the phone sounds like Homer Simpson.
[33:04.94]Everybody sounds like Homer Simpson.
[33:07.36]He is an accountant from Las Vegas.
[33:10.12]Always believed he should be a World War I fighter.
[33:13.60]But boss, he's blind.
[33:17.36]We are going to put him in an old car, shake it up, and make airplay with him.
[33:21.85]Once again, we will prove that all is not what it seems.
[33:27.01]Boss, you're a genius.
[33:29.59]Welcome, friends.
[33:31.11]Welcome to Fantasy East.
[33:37.19]Could you ever watch TV like this?
[33:38.83]I don't know what it is with some people, I'll tell you.
[33:49.03]I'll talk about this after this.
[33:50.42]W?
[34:10.42]Alright, so... I can't... I can't watch fucking... I can't watch movies like that.
[34:18.30]Right, exactly.
[34:19.04]Because I... People that download movies illegally... I've seen an illegal movie before.
[34:24.93]You know what I mean?
[34:26.11]Like a... Oh, I downloaded this, I don't know, like 15 years ago.
[34:28.79]I was in college and my roommate wanted to show me, right?
[34:31.72]And... I...
[34:33.48]It looks like that.
[34:34.42]It's like all crusty.
[34:35.36]It's like fucking... You can't even hear what people are saying.
[34:40.28]It looks like shit.
[34:41.48]Just go fucking watch the movie.
[34:44.60]I can't even fucking stand it.
[34:46.17]That was 15 years ago.
[34:51.65]That's not true anymore.
[34:57.47]It is?
[34:57.71]It is?
[35:03.87]Wait, it's not like somebody has, like, the handycam in the seat, like, pointing at the screen?
[35:12.67]People don't do that anymore?
[35:15.34]Cam rips are mostly... Well, that's... It's got a name.
[35:18.98]It's called cam rips.
[35:22.74]What is this guy doing?
[35:28.02]He's like... Is he laughing or crying?
[35:30.44]Alright.
[35:32.71]It's Blu-ray now.
[35:34.55]Oh.
[35:36.81]Well, just pretend that you're, like, just pretend it's 15 years ago.
[35:41.49]I couldn't stand it.
[35:42.18]I remember sitting there watching, uh, I believe it was Napoleon Dynamite was the movie.
[35:51.98]And I had already seen Napoleon Dynamite, like, twice in the theater.
[35:57.44]And I remember just sitting there and thinking, I can't hear this, what they're saying.
[36:02.34]I can't see what they're doing.
[36:05.36]I am not watching this movie.
[36:08.63]I'm experiencing noise.
[36:12.01]And everybody turned and looked at me.
[36:15.43]And I was like, what?
[36:17.97]And then I got up and went to the bathroom.
[36:19.41]And when I came back to go back to the room where everyone was watching the movie, the door was closed.
[36:26.54]So I fucking booted up World of Warcraft.
[36:30.58]And it was at that moment that I became one of the best priests on the whole server.
[36:36.29]So, you know, it's all good.
[36:40.17]That was where I started the journey.
[36:53.49]Uh-oh.
[36:54.95]Scary music.
[36:57.27]It's this guy again.
[36:58.39]What?
[36:58.71]Who the fuck is this person?
[37:27.68]What?
[37:27.80]What is he talking about?
[37:29.36]What's going on?
[37:30.08]Will you wait here?
[37:31.62]You're gonna hand this to me.
[37:33.29]What the fuck?
[37:57.31]I just want to see the movie!
[38:03.35]Wait, he hasn't... What do I have to do?
[38:06.45]What am I supposed to do?
[38:07.19]Is this real?
[38:08.09]I think this is like a dream.
[38:31.69]This is like... This is how this is actually happening.
[38:37.43]What the fuck?
[38:44.21]This is Jim Carrey.
[38:49.91]That actually is just Jim Carrey.
[39:03.18]Wait a minute.
[39:03.76]I don't have to do the whole thing again, do I?
[39:06.55]Should I save it?
[39:11.71]He stood up and... Oh, you got me!
[39:18.18]What should I call it?
[39:36.96]File name.
[39:38.22]Save file as.
[39:39.37]So what's going on here?
[39:40.49]Right here?
[39:42.99]Why am I saving it now?
[39:44.07]I don't even know how to get back to this menu.
[39:46.85]Hold on.
[39:49.17]There's no menu screen.
[39:57.08]I guess we'll just... Oh, this is not good.
[40:01.76]Uh-oh.
[40:10.97]Is it time for a speedrun?
[40:12.47]We might not have to speedrun.
[40:17.98]No, I pressed resume?
[40:20.18]Restore?
[40:25.82]How do you save a game?
[40:33.37]I don't think there's a way to save a game in mid-game.
[40:45.10]Go into control.
[40:46.92]Look, there's nothing here.
[40:48.42]Move, spin, use, shoot.
[40:50.47]Look left, look right, look back.
[40:52.15]Punch, block, kick.
[40:56.77]There's no, like, menu.
[41:03.69]Let's see if I can speedrun it.
[41:05.83]I can.
[41:27.92]I have to see that, I'm sorry.
[41:28.82]Okay, now we have to wait for the guy to come in the, uh, in the... Here we go?
[41:36.07]Okay.
[41:36.17]Alright, you know how the Macho Man Randy Savage, that video, where it's just him breathing?
[41:49.13]I'm making one of those right now.
[41:53.01]Hmm.
[41:56.17]Hmm.
[41:58.81]Don't forget your keys, stupid.
[41:59.83]Alright, here we go.
[42:04.87]Alright, get in here.
[42:06.01]Fight me.
[42:06.33]Let's go.
[42:15.51]What happens if I escape?
[42:17.77]No, escape doesn't get a menu or anything.
[42:20.15]Tab?
[42:20.83]Tab?
[42:21.15]No, tab is skip.
[42:21.97]I'm gonna press...
[42:29.27]Okay, so I have figured it out.
[42:31.99]The button you have to press is X. Cool.
[42:41.73]So how the hell do I save a file?
[42:54.94]Okay, got it.
[42:55.52]I'm on one.
[42:57.96]So, X is to pause the game.
[43:02.80]How the fuck would I have known how to do that?
[43:06.52]Okay, you can put the menu down now.
[43:14.77]What the hell is going on?
[43:15.91]I just turned off my brain, apparently.
[43:27.46]Okay.
[43:29.58]Sure.
[43:30.10]I guess that worked.
[43:31.81]We're good.
[43:32.13]Okay.
[43:43.82]Press the button.
[43:45.80]When does he come in?
[43:59.85]When does the dude come in?
[44:04.27]That's like looking outside.
[44:05.47]Leave.
[44:15.90]Why won't he... I can't trigger this event!
[44:17.60]I have to lick the plate, you're right, fuck.
[44:29.68]Out of the knife.
[44:32.64]Lick plate.
[44:34.60]Okay.
[44:34.82]I'm ready.
[44:35.28]I can't eat the fish.
[44:36.36]It's not an eat fish game.
[44:58.29]Why would I want to eat the fish anyways?
[44:59.57]Alright, please!
[45:01.95]Get in here so I can skip everything!
[45:19.24]What?
[45:20.67]I didn't get these before.
[45:32.00]How do I get to the fucking door?
[45:35.32]It's over here.
[45:37.53]I need to just turn a little bit more.
[45:39.19]Turn.
[45:39.31]Stri- Spin?
[45:43.97]What is spin?
[45:45.21]What is spin?
[45:51.62]S?
[46:02.22]It's not doing anything.
[46:04.22]Oh my god, I just wanna leave, look through the peephole.
[46:06.62]I'm just trying to get the door in focus, but I can't get the door in focus!
[46:17.00]It's- I wanna go that way.
[46:17.99]Holy shit, I'm gonna lose my mind.
[46:36.25]it's left no not the phone left it's right here the door is right here what the fuck is happening I didn't even click
[47:03.65]The door is over here.
[47:04.83]Why can I not get it into view anymore?
[47:11.74]The game does not want me to look at the door ever again.
[47:42.46]That's the only way I can see this door.
[47:47.88]I have to be at the table and hit right twice.
[47:57.79]How the fuck do I... Alright.
[48:07.75]Here we go.
[48:08.74]Jack Fremont?
[48:12.18]Your butt is mine, Freddy.
[48:15.12]Didn't hurt.
[48:17.84]That wasn't hard.
[48:19.28]Didn't hurt.
[48:21.10]See you, Fred.
[48:42.23]I got a date with Destiny.
[48:44.07]At least she's got a friend for me.
[48:48.23]That was just a Three Stooges segment, but they cut out all the parts that were funny.
[48:56.46]Jack, you got a quarter?
[48:58.66]For a cup of coffee?
[49:00.50]Sorry, James, you're a little tapped out.
[49:02.58]How are you going to write the book?
[49:04.96]I don't know just how it started.
[49:07.72]Why?
[49:09.37]Here we go.
[49:12.30]Wake up.
[49:13.74]Alright, let's save the game here.
[49:19.93]Save it as 1.pml, replace, yes.
[49:23.43]Let's go.
[49:23.79]Okay, now it's a question of touching everything.
[49:36.09]Touch everything, touch everything, touch everything.
[49:40.53]I'm almost there.
[49:41.73]Bear with me.
[49:44.01]Twice.
[49:44.49]Three.
[49:45.19]Four.
[49:45.95]Five times in the jacket.
[49:46.87]Six times in the jacket.
[49:47.67]Seven times in the jacket.
[49:49.45]That's it?
[49:53.04]Sneeze.
[49:54.40]Sneeze into the jacket.
[50:01.76]Computer.
[50:06.34]Wash the hands.
[50:16.79]Why does this work now?
[50:19.93]This didn't work before.
[50:20.75]What?
[50:23.57]I've just been staring at the computer all day and all night.
[50:27.89]They had their conversation and they left.
[50:30.54]Sun's coming up now.
[50:48.87]Okay, remember reading this.
[50:51.50]Alright, save again.
[50:59.45]Save as 1.pml.
[51:00.49]Yes.
[51:01.93]Resume.
[51:04.49]We're good to go.
[51:06.09]Let's do it.
[51:08.65]Now, what am I supposed to do here?
[51:15.20]This guy comes in and he does like the weird fucking Bugs Bunny bullshit and then he leaves and then I have to dodge?
[51:38.15]What?
[51:42.98]He's in the fri- Huh?
[51:44.14]It's different!
[51:45.10]I have to fight him again?
[52:10.02]Is the guy gonna walk in here with a gun?
[52:35.86]Goldfish?
[52:36.36]I ate a fish.
[52:37.44]I did.
[52:37.88]Oh, now he jumps out of the window.
[52:40.89]I can fly!
[52:41.15]I'm on the fourth floor, you idiot!
[53:00.17]Okay, there's that, there's that Bugs Bunny bullshit.
[53:02.65]Now we're gonna get Bugs Bunny bullshit part two.
[53:04.69]He's outside.
[53:06.19]Jeez, Fred, do you ever quit?
[53:10.01]Who are you?
[53:11.63]That would be so funny if it actually was him.
[53:22.54]Jack, you shouldn't have got involved!
[53:31.79]Alright, how do I do this?
[53:33.07]Is it loaded?
[53:34.55]Okay.
[53:34.77]Now...
[54:12.54]You can run, but you can't hide, Jack.
[54:19.08]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[54:20.92]Okay.
[54:21.66]Out the window.
[54:25.31]Uh-oh.
[54:42.07]He can't fly.
[54:43.45]Only Frank can fly.
[54:44.83]Oh, I love this job.
[54:46.61]I think I'll take it.
[55:15.48]Why?
[55:15.72]Alright, so what about the guy with the Donatello headband, the fat guy?
[55:22.21]Why was he not out there?
[55:24.35]Now, it would have been really fucking ridiculous if he was lying out there too.
[55:32.11]Alright, let's go.
[55:41.52]He was outside the door.
[55:55.21]What am I doing?
[55:57.00]Here we go.
[55:59.34]Nope.
[55:59.54]Alright, he's in the fucking fridge.
[56:01.08]I forgot.
[56:01.90]Is he blocking me with a drumstick?
[56:09.82]It is chicken.
[56:20.85]And then he jumps out.
[56:26.60]Get out of my house.
[56:31.50]With pleasure.
[56:49.70]Alright, see you later.
[56:50.72]Thanks for visiting.
[56:52.88]I can't see.
[57:06.82]He just landed.
[57:08.69]He just landed.
[57:11.53]A second ago.
[57:13.55]He got up there real fast.
[57:15.13]Alright, get me the fu- Alright.
[57:18.11]Go!
[57:21.07]Another window?
[57:29.26]No, no, no, no, no.
[57:31.18]It's just a different window.
[57:35.12]It's just a different window.
[57:36.54]He thinks he's an eagle.
[57:39.86]He thinks he's an eagle.
[57:44.28]He can't fly.
[57:44.89]Only Frank can fly.
[58:06.96]I have to save it right when he's pointing the gun.
[58:08.98]You know what I mean?
[58:15.81]God damn it.
[58:19.31]What about the knife?
[58:20.13]I don't know if I can do it.
[58:21.49]I'm gonna have to try to like attack him.
[58:27.42]Do I still have any of the stuff that... I wish I could have... I wish I could look in, like, an inventory or something.
[58:33.78]I want to go to the table.
[58:38.62]No, table!
[58:50.73]Alright, for the love of God, let's go.
[59:03.01]Okay.
[59:03.95]Just in case something goes wrong here, this is gonna be two.
[59:32.73]Why is he pulling at him?
[60:05.44]Why did he point at him?
[60:07.66]Alright, we're good.
[60:08.32]Alright, so what the fuck?
[60:14.39]How do I... I can't turn this way, that way.
[60:17.09]Look, I can only go out the window.
[60:21.41]I don't have any... Enter.
[60:22.81]S...
[60:38.84]Try all the windows.
[60:44.40]Didn't I already do the left window?
[60:46.12]And the right window?
[60:47.26]That's the... Okay.
[60:48.40]There's this window.
[60:49.59]What about this way?
[60:50.23]To jump or not to jump?
[60:53.69]I already did both windows.
[60:57.15]I did the windows.
[60:58.05]Both of them.
[60:58.87]Okay.
[61:11.23]Okay, I'm gonna punch.
[61:29.40]Punch, block, kick.
[61:33.96]Punch, block, kick.
[61:34.74]Punch, block, kick.
[61:37.19]What the fuck?
[61:49.13]Just keep spinning around?
[61:50.11]I don't think that's gonna work.
[61:58.14]You know, I'm not gonna follow you, Dad.
[62:04.16]You want to jump?
[62:20.93]He thinks he's a beast!
[62:48.23]Okay, so, um... The walkthrough says to jump out the right window.
[62:59.46]What?
[63:04.68]This is the left window.
[63:05.64]This is the right window.
[63:15.17]This is the left window.
[63:18.67]You only can go out the left window.
[63:23.21]What happened?
[63:27.53]What?
[63:32.93]What happened?
[63:36.87]Meet me at what a trip.
[63:44.34]8 o'clock.
[63:45.50]My place.
[63:45.94]Take it, Pictionary.
[63:50.12]rewind.
[63:52.10]Am I dead?
[63:54.24]Damn bloody nuisances, undercover outfits and all.
[63:56.63]Look, I'm being followed.
[64:00.13]Frank, he's such a disappointment.
[64:01.63]Frank who?
[64:02.15]Now what we have here is a DNA verification tracker.
[64:05.05]Try not to break it.
[64:06.10]We've identified your target's DNA and matched it to a...
[64:23.77]He thinks he's an eagle!
[64:31.32]He thinks he's an eagle!
[64:44.60]I guess that is the scene.
[64:50.05]Meet me at Watertrip.
[64:51.75]We'll see.
[64:54.47]Wasn't they just concrete on the ground?
[64:58.29]That doesn't make any sense.
[65:06.54]I jumped out the left window on the first try and I died.
[65:14.49]Now what we have here is a DNA verification tracker.
[65:18.11]Try not to break it.
[65:19.15]We've identified your target's DNA and matched it to a graphic display inside this helmet.
[65:24.39]His code name is the Fox.
[65:25.55]Now, non-matching targets will be in green.
[65:28.90]The Fox will be in red.
[65:29.84]Wait.
[65:30.74]And the faint flicks of red you see are similar DNA strands that I share with the Fox.
[65:35.48]Now, the Fox has always prided himself on being able to blend in with the crowd.
[65:39.17]This should separate him out nicely.
[65:42.41]But...
[66:03.46]I would have laughed if that worked.
[66:04.56]That would have been awesome if it worked.
[66:06.60]If you think they're people, if you're trying to scare the people...
[66:21.91]What the fuck am I doing?
[66:27.92]What am I?
[66:28.38]What did it say?
[66:29.46]Hello, Jack.
[66:36.84]Huh?
[66:38.26]You know what Mr. Krabs says?
[66:52.93]Feel good?
[66:54.29]Feel good.
[66:55.73]Oh, good.
[66:56.59]I can't wait.
[66:58.22]You napped my neck.
[66:59.94]Where was the stain?
[67:06.82]Okay.
[67:08.26]We need to... I need another... Oh, God damn it.
[67:10.90]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[67:12.18]Oh, God damn it.
[67:25.35]What is this?
[67:27.79]What does he say here?
[67:31.36]Do I have to, like, shoot the thing?
[67:37.32]I'm sticking... I'm going two.
[67:38.54]I'm going three.
[67:46.91]Okay.
[68:07.85]I'm following them?
[68:10.39]Who am I following?
[68:14.71]Why is he running so frantically?
[68:23.58]I don't even know who I'm following.
[68:34.50]Oh, that's him!
[68:36.24]Wait, that's the guy!
[68:38.30]Briefcase!
[68:39.08]From the beginning!
[68:42.66]What am I stopping for?
[68:45.42]I... I just...
[68:57.08]I don't recognize his face.
[68:58.94]Just a delivery boy.
[69:00.60]Amateur.
[69:01.92]You're a freak without a whore.
[69:04.94]And the outhouse is on fire.
[69:07.57]Don't fret, my ma.
[69:09.37]But... I have not pressed a button.
[69:13.35]You are seeing how the game is put together on its own.
[69:16.84]I'm not skipping anything.
[69:18.24]Great point.
[69:19.64]As his scorch had died...
[69:22.65]They can't take away our pride.
[69:24.96]We're gonna stand and fight.
[69:29.06]For sure, I am.
[69:30.16]I like you.
[69:32.58]Trust no one.
[69:33.88]Fine, disc.
[69:35.36]You haven't got much time.
[69:39.76]Disc?
[69:40.06]That wasn't so hard.
[69:43.46]Okay, I got the disc.
[69:49.58]Oh!
[69:50.80]Oh!
[69:57.13]Is there money in there?
[70:03.03]I'm gonna save it.
[70:04.37]I ain't fucking around.
[70:09.03]He's still alive Jason they've
[70:33.72]A horse in our water killed our cattle and burnt down the outhouse.
[70:41.06]What happened?
[70:47.36]Long story.
[70:48.52]Just an observation, but, um, I think you should get out of here.
[70:51.88]Obvious.
[70:53.10]Who are you?
[70:54.90]I just thought I could help.
[70:57.10]Uh-oh, behind me, behind me.
[70:59.81]Okay, I'll wear the sheep, but you're not shaving my head, huh?
[71:05.76]Are these scenes are filmed out of order?
[71:07.90]Huh?
[71:08.12]Dr. Fine?
[71:08.68]Dr. Howard?
[71:09.26]Dr. Fine?
[71:09.68]Chauncey?
[71:09.94]What happened to me?
[71:11.98]Oh, hello, dear boy.
[71:13.02]I live under the weather.
[71:14.31]Mix of Chinese and Mexican.
[71:34.82]Stomach feels like it's gonna explode.
[71:37.82]Did she just shit his pants?
[71:39.78]Yes.
[71:41.02]Look, I'd love to discuss Nouvelle Cuisine, but I figure you're here for a reason.
[71:46.18]Quite right.
[71:46.98]Doctor, doctor.
[71:48.34]Whoops.
[71:48.82]I've got a bad case of blood.
[71:54.25]A bad case of blood?
[71:55.37]There's small turbines installed behind the binding.
[71:58.95]This will be very useful in Los Angeles.
[72:02.02]Jack, are you okay?
[72:03.51]Oh, yeah, you know, a couple little bruises, but I'm okay.
[72:06.37]Dr. Fawcett to urology.
[72:08.03]Hey, hey, super spy.
[72:08.97]I saw her first.
[72:10.79]I'll get this wig from Shirley MacLaine.
[72:13.29]It's too tight, though.
[72:14.50]A little snug, I think, maybe.
[72:16.62]Good evening, Mr. Fremont.
[72:18.90]How nice it is to finally meet you.
[72:21.38]Dave Incentrated?
[72:22.24]Now, be good, boy, and give us disk.
[72:24.09]Disk?
[72:28.18]I'm gonna take a wild guess here that you're the bad guys.
[72:31.82]Er, girls.
[72:33.74]Weissenheimer.
[72:34.34]Nurses, kill them both!
[72:38.00]Oh, shit!
[72:39.17]She's a ninja.
[72:41.85]My ninja.
[72:45.63]It's that run.
[72:52.71]I'm not doing any of this.
[73:01.60]Double punch.
[73:03.62]Double punch.
[73:09.07]Hey!
[73:10.21]That was completely unnecessary.
[73:14.29]What the fuck?
[73:18.13]What am I doing to this guy?
[73:19.37]What am I just like...
[73:22.17]Did I just faith heal him?
[73:36.76]Why does everybody have so many things going on?
[73:56.89]What a big send-off.
[73:58.75]I've got the dish and I've got the girl.
[74:04.03]Is he waving?
[74:05.29]Okay.
[74:06.57]We have to... I gotta... I'm... Oh, for the love of God, this has to happen again.
[74:26.68]Okay, I'm going to tell you guys something.
[74:27.76]I'm going to skip every two or three seconds, and you will not notice a difference from in real time.
[74:33.13]You ready?
[74:37.41]Dr. Fine?
[74:38.89]Dr. Howard?
[74:46.96]Dr. Howard?
[74:51.76]I was assuming that it was going to kill all those fight scenes.
[74:55.13]But it's not.
[74:55.95]It goes right... Okay.
[74:58.69]It goes right to you in the chair.
[75:00.35]It's got rockets on it.
[75:16.18]I can't stop the chair If I supposed to be finding somebody
[75:43.77]Who am I supposed to be fighting?
[75:52.51]I made it!
[75:54.19]I made it!
[75:54.83]I didn't make it?
[76:20.93]Why do I have to go around so many times in a circle?
[76:24.75]And the noise is... And he's on a rocket.
[76:31.59]That thing doesn't have that much fuel.
[76:34.44]And how am I doing this around a circle?
[76:36.06]No one has grabbed the chair.
[76:38.46]There's like dozens and dozens and dozens of employees here.
[76:41.34]No one has thought to just like push me over or grab the chair.
[76:46.32]I'm going around in a circle around the same hallway and no one can stop me.
[76:52.58]Go grab a fucking mattress from one of the beds in the hospital and put it up in front of me.
[77:02.44]Do a reverse Wile E. Coyote to the roadrunner on me.
[77:06.79]Oh, this is fucking unbelievable.
[77:08.07]Okay, here we go.
[77:08.87]Alright.
[77:11.77]Bye!
[77:38.83]He's still wrestling with that guy's crutch.
[77:41.32]What?
[78:09.60]Why did that go so slowly?
[78:12.14]You guys talking about rockets!
[78:13.82]The rockets don't fucking matter!
[78:15.42]It's going two miles per hour!
[78:31.94]I can't go that way!
[78:51.80]I don't... It's never gonna stop.
[79:05.45]It's never gonna stop.

[83:57.13]I'll be back in, like, fucking five minutes.
[84:00.09]My whole body hurts.
[84:02.53]That was one of the most fucking ridiculous, stupid, goddamn things I've ever seen in anything I've ever done.
[84:07.67]On this stream.
[84:08.27]Like, in a video game.
[84:09.24]Like, what the fuck was that for?
[84:11.78]I can't fucking believe it.
[84:17.85]This just went up.
[84:19.19]That qualifies as a car, I think.
[84:21.05]Another fold letter grade.
[84:21.85]It's at like a B minus.
[84:22.78]I'll be right back.
[86:41.36]Dude, when I was just peeing, I just peed all over my fucking floor.
[86:45.17]And all over the toilet seat and everything.
[86:46.43]I just had to clean it up.
[86:48.41]I just saw, I started peeing in mid-stream, mid-piss.
[86:52.83]I just started laughing fucking hysterically because I kept seeing an image of that guy with the crutches.
[86:56.89]They kept like fucking, every of the, maybe every four or five scenes, it was them knocking the crutches out from underneath the guy and like ripping it out of his hands.
[87:10.96]That was ridiculous.
[87:13.12]They're dressed in nurses outfits and they're just like fucking just making this guy's life a living hell.
[87:18.46]They weren't even looking for me.
[87:26.79]And now I gotta do all that shit again.
[87:28.07]I just had to like clean up.
[87:33.81]I just had to clean my bathroom.
[87:48.17]Let me just open up my pineapple juice.
[87:56.58]That guy like broke his leg or something.
[88:00.48]Oh, that's so fucking ridiculous.
[88:02.12]Alright, I'm going to try this again.
[88:03.62]And now, so apparently it is this long, I guess.
[88:09.81]You have to go all the way to the top of the elevator and then don't go in the elevator a third time.
[88:19.90]Just use elevator.
[88:20.98]Alright, I'm gonna try.

[91:08.76]Do I just have to keep going back in the elevator until something happens?
[91:20.19]Help!
[91:35.60]How do I stop it?
[91:52.80]Somebody just copy pasted how to do this.

[126:14.36]Because sound fucks me up.
[126:15.35]Turning off the sound.
[126:16.87]Turning off the game.
[126:55.84]What the...
[127:32.01]I need to see, this game is so crazy I have to fucking get by this part.
[127:35.94]This is our only opportunity to ever see this game and how fucking crazy it is.
[127:44.16]I can't have anybody watching what I'm doing.
[127:52.30]Alright, I'm almost there.
[128:14.56]I keep losing to the third person.
[128:17.22]I keep losing to the third person.
[128:18.56]I don't know how I did it the first time.
[128:19.96]I have no idea.
[128:21.22]I've tried punching.
[128:21.94]I've tried blocking.
[128:22.66]I've tried kicking.
[128:24.86]I cannot beat this third person.
[128:30.20]I'm trying to kick her.
[128:30.98]It won't work.
[128:38.53]Here, look.
[128:38.97]I'll give you something else to watch.
[128:41.55]I'm looking at the guide right now.
[128:42.49]It says kick the third one.
[128:44.54]I tried kicking four times in a row, didn't work.
[128:50.08]I have to get through this shit!
[129:05.37]This is my last try.
[129:20.07]No!

[130:28.71]I just, I fucking screamed and I, it's gone.
[130:32.27]I can't, I'm sorry.
[130:35.23]This is gonna be my last try on this and then I'm gonna have to move on to another game.
[130:46.31]What the hell?
[130:46.95]Ow.

[132:32.49]Suspect second disc in Colorado ski hut.
[132:36.38]Stop all CIA.
[132:48.60]I did that, like, two weeks ago.
[132:50.25]I would say that was, like, childish and not funny.
[132:52.51]I did that a couple weeks ago on the Kinect stream.
[132:55.59]I don't even get to play, like, a casino game?
[133:01.79]Let's go.
[133:25.33]What would I do with two million dollars?
[133:28.61]That's the game's budget.
[133:29.42]I would spend... I would spend one million dollars on a stream.
[133:31.88]And then I would plant, like, 600 billion trees.
[133:33.56]Ski Hut 3.
[133:33.82]Which one should I go to?
[134:02.54]Two?
[134:08.96]I'm pretty good at skiing.
[134:10.05]I didn't know he was this... Alright.
[134:11.43]Do I have to do anything?
[134:14.89]Two.
[134:17.25]Go to two.
[134:19.21]Two.
[134:38.68]They found me, apparently.
[134:46.22]That guy was having trouble.
[134:48.10]That was an actor.
[134:48.76]That wasn't even a guy that's like a stuntman.
[135:00.49]Why would I be doing this now?
[135:03.54]by inviting everybody running around like chicken with leg cut off.
[135:09.07]This is not a morcoz, either.
[135:10.75]Where could it be?
[135:14.21]What?
[135:16.15]Ted Blake is Rod Nichols, P.I.
[135:17.73]Will Hart.
[135:18.67]And last night, some fast-rotting hot pants walked right across the stage.
[135:21.94]He's playing his Game Boy on the slopes.
[135:23.90]Ladies, I got one word for you.
[135:25.76]Yogurt to the hungry shirt.
[135:30.34]I'm lying down watching TV on my portable DVD player.
[135:44.91]Do we get to do anything here?
[135:47.51]Or do I just have to watch this guy ski in like a prison outfit?
[136:06.78]Oh, no.
[136:07.52]Can I resume?
[136:08.08]I can.
[136:13.72]Ski hut.
[136:14.38]Let's try four.
[136:15.96]Ski hut.

[136:28.84]But what if he was alright?
[136:30.06]What if he landed?
[136:30.84]There we go.
[136:47.46]What?!
[136:58.09]I'm losing points, right?
[136:59.15]Are you supposed to go around them?
[137:07.66]Fuck.
[137:10.41]I can't do it.
[137:11.27]It's too much.
[137:13.01]It's the stupid... It's the fucking rocket chair again.
[137:17.59]Oh my fucking god.
[137:40.87]Alright, I never skied competitively in my entire life.
[137:50.23]I don't know anything about skiing.
[137:51.20]I don't know how the points work.
[137:53.24]You go to the left of the blue flag and the right of the red flag.
[137:56.22]Is that correct?
[138:00.62]Or did I just describe our political parties?
[138:02.95]Which one is it?
[138:14.13]Yeah, I got it right.
[138:23.31]That's so hard.
[138:35.59]What?
[138:35.95]I didn't do it right.
[138:44.40]Why'd he live off this one?
[138:47.48]Check the poles.
[138:53.15]You're supposed to fall, but only in a different place.
[138:55.95]You have to fall at the right time.
[138:58.29]Can we do this again?
[139:08.18]What?
[139:17.15]He just shot me in the head.
[139:39.75]I don't know what's going on.
[139:51.61]I have cheese.

[150:49.37]No borders?
[150:51.20]This old bit.
[150:51.90]I'm too nervous and too shook up to tell you anything.
[150:55.40]Well, snowboarders are trying to kill me, but I killed all of them.
[151:31.91]What the hell's he doing?
[151:34.61]Oh, yeah.
[151:39.57]Yeah, faster.
[151:43.06]Oh, you're real good.
[151:45.42]Buffett.
[151:46.16]John Buffett.
[151:47.18]Yeah, yeah.
[151:48.24]Who's what?
[151:49.32]Oh, yeah.
[151:51.18]Says the airlines have cut back on service.
[151:53.32]Honey, I want this nail buffed to make gloss, a high gloss like a mirror.
[151:57.49]Yes.
[152:00.61]Oh, there's Rob Lowe.
[152:01.57]There he is.
[152:02.49]All the money.
[152:03.55]Remember you said this budget was two million?
[152:05.63]There's most of it.
[152:27.82]I'm impressed.
[152:28.68]But if you act now, you'll put an unsightly wrinkle in my mast plan.
[152:31.90]Everybody's got a chip there.
[152:33.25]But that's not all.
[152:34.73]I like to think of these as nuclear accidents for fun and profit.
[152:37.69]Most of these other so-called commercial hosts, they sit back in Los Angeles.
[152:41.14]They hog their pathetic wares, but...
[152:49.07]Your toast that little ball chicken all of her minions.
[152:52.17]Well, they won't have any weight problems anymore.
[152:54.01]They'll all be able to fit in one ashtray You're pretty
[153:10.36]What do you mean, how?
[153:10.98]With Los Angeles gone, a secret satellite will beam my infomercials all over the world to every country.
[153:16.52]I'll name the tools and more.
[153:17.96]From Algeria to Zaire, I will remake the world in my own perfect TV image.
[153:24.22]All hail the new king.
[153:30.37]Rob loathed the bad guy.
[153:35.00]I thought we had to do something about the punch.
[153:39.78]Why is it dubbed?
[153:41.22]What?
[153:41.84]What the fuck is going on?
[153:44.30]What?
[153:57.50]Why are there like four Roblo's?
[153:59.08]Where is- Who the fuck are these people?
[154:01.58]He's the pilot too.
[154:03.08]He's everybody.
[154:03.70]Roblo is everyone.
[154:27.75]Do I have a parachute?
[154:31.59]Has my backpack been a parachute this whole time?
[154:33.73]I'm still wearing my backpack from the very beginning of the game.
[154:37.91]Wait, it's this guy!
[154:39.25]The fucking weirdo!
[154:42.19]What?! !
[155:09.10]Um.
[155:11.00]Green screen.
[155:15.20]Am I gonna fight the Rob Lowe's?
[155:19.34]In the air.
[155:22.93]No.
[155:25.37]There's no way.
[155:29.20]I didn't even shoot him.
[155:30.26]Somebody shot him accidentally.
[155:34.32]What the fuck is going on?
[155:36.16]Who am I?
[155:37.48]Am I in control?
[155:39.42]Get him!
[155:40.12]Now they're dropping cartoon anvils.
[156:08.19]Let it go!
[156:09.51]Let the anvil go!
[156:11.11]Just let it go!
[156:12.59]Don't hold the whole time!
[156:14.02]Let go of the anvil!
[156:30.06]Why would you fucking hold on to that?
[156:31.68]That was weighing you down.
[156:35.92]Oh, that's bad.
[156:36.98]No, it's not.
[156:39.80]Got them both.
[156:42.58]I'm flying.
[157:02.53]I honestly don't even know who I'm aiming at here.
[157:09.96]No, don't... Just don't touch him.
[157:16.38]Don't touch the angles.
[157:32.07]I keep grabbing the anvils on just reflex.
[157:34.47]Get him!
[157:34.93]Don't touch the anvil.
[157:38.50]Here they come.
[158:05.16]Okay, he had like 5 clones, not like 30 people.
[158:08.44]I'm out of ammo.
[158:14.61]Oh, that's not good.
[158:20.97]Open the backpack.
[158:31.35]I... landed on my feet.
[158:47.35]I just landed I didn't skip it, I promise
[159:09.47]I don't even know what the fuck he said.
[159:11.97]Right, alright, here we go.
[159:16.51]What drugs did we take?
[159:19.91]Um, I don't know.
[159:24.93]They didn't add the parachute scene?
[159:26.53]They probably ran out of money, and they thought, hey, well, we don't have any money, but don't you think it'd be funny if we just landed?
[159:31.41]And they probably all laughed on set.
[159:34.15]They probably had, like, a good time making this.
[159:41.08]Where are we going now?
[159:56.41]This is the Fyre Fest of video games.
[159:59.55]What?
[160:14.30]So we're going back to Vegas.
[160:16.62]Then we just leave Vegas?
[160:19.77]Why don't I see if I can get someone to talk to us?
[160:51.92]Oh, there he is again.
[160:52.58]Hey, Gene, pardon me, it's your job.
[160:59.28]Oh, Gene, it's you.
[161:01.12]Hey, Chauncey.
[161:04.74]I did it, right?
[161:08.84]I ain't no Chauncey.
[161:10.08]Wait.
[161:12.80]This actually helps.
[161:13.86]Evening, old boy.
[161:15.44]Oh, now there he is.
[161:16.38]I'm sorry about what happened that last time, Rick.
[161:18.56]But the clue is it's still somewhere down there.
[161:21.14]Great.
[161:22.74]That's a pretty good Elvis.
[161:23.70]That's a pretty good Elvis.
[161:25.44]Oh, not this shit again.
[162:08.20]I'm afraid to open this.
[162:12.96]Okay, it was nothing.
[162:18.06]It was...
[162:26.43]What?
[162:27.45]There's a... A trap door.
[162:31.43]Here.
[162:36.02]Am I just taking shit?
[162:37.84]What is underneath here?
[162:38.78]Is this drugs?
[162:40.56]What is going on?
[162:41.42]Why would they be letting me do this?
[162:46.40]What the fuck is going on?
[162:47.95]Am I watching TV?
[162:58.58]What the fuck?
[162:59.52]Turn it off!
[163:00.20]Why would you watch this?
[163:22.89]Didn't even why did I click that?
[163:24.09]Well, I didn't even do anything.
[163:25.21]No, I don't want to watch it again What is in here Mr. Fremont we have all the Russian expression, you know bones get be clean.
[163:39.62]Yuck rascal don't gay the cabot You blow on my head I
[163:50.63]And kiss on my neck.
[163:53.59]Wrong.
[163:55.11]I blow off your head and piss down your neck.
[164:07.28]What?
[164:08.72]What?
[164:22.15]I... I was... I... What do I got?
[164:35.42]Nothing.
[164:37.42]I don't got shit.
[164:38.58]I got nothing.
[164:43.78]Oh, no.
[164:45.68]That was too... It was outrageous.
[164:48.59]What the fuck just happened?
[164:50.93]That was...
[164:59.10]These games are fucking ridiculous.
[165:08.92]What do I do now?
[165:11.73]It was so easy for you not to do that.
[165:14.15]You dumped that on yourself on purpose.
[165:27.25]Anything else to do?
[165:29.51]I don't think so.
[165:30.83]What about the door over here?
[165:38.73]No, now I'm going up the stairs.
[165:45.29]I... I don't know what that was.
[165:48.35]I just planted something?
[165:52.86]Oh no, not this.
[166:02.79]Mr. Fremont, thanks for dropping in.
[166:05.84]What?
[166:06.24]Nice place.
[166:07.26]Who does your decorating?
[166:08.48]Please don't struggle or Alan will have to shoot you in the head.
[166:13.62]What's going on here?
[166:15.02]Well, since you're going to die anyway, I guess there's no other choice.
[166:20.18]Elevator flashbacks from the rocket wheelchair.
[166:24.53]We've been skimming off these slot machines for years.
[166:27.15]Years.
[166:36.23]They're just dumping like a laundry chute of coins down here.
[166:42.75]This is the scam operation.
[166:44.25]Why are they all dressed like this?
[166:51.85]You could clearly be in casual clothing.
[166:54.10]Why are they dressed like that?
[166:59.04]They're not handling hazardous materials, you... It's point.
[167:04.28]Up above you is Mrs. Fletner.
[167:06.30]She's been gambling for 36 hours straight.
[167:09.06]Pumping in those George Washingtons, hoping for that big $10 million payoff.
[167:15.04]200 million nickels.
[167:16.42]Something like that.
[167:17.50]But what she doesn't know is that machines been fixed to never pay off.
[167:21.86]So this is like an old lady?
[167:23.65]I thought he was walking me in here and I'm gonna get- it's gonna fill up and kill me.
[167:47.21]Why don't you just go upstairs and call the kids?
[167:52.41]You vent this machine for 36 hours.
[167:53.93]For the last time, it's not going to pay off.
[167:57.15]I think it's ready.
[167:57.95]I can feel it.
[167:59.27]I'll tell you what.
[168:00.33]They're having a $0.29 special if you don't pay.
[168:02.59]Leave my lucky machine to not take that chance.
[168:04.72]Miss Tucker!
[168:06.62]Stop!
[168:07.58]Carol?
[168:08.36]What?
[168:09.20]Did you hear something funny?
[168:10.54]I am.
[168:17.11]Did she win?
[168:19.99]What was I holding?
[168:33.30]Jackpot!
[168:34.82]Hold on.
[168:35.70]How did I get out?
[168:36.80]How did I get out?
[168:37.64]How did I get out of there?
[168:44.89]Did I just open the door?
[168:47.77]Wait, was it 17?
[168:48.46]I don't know.
[168:50.26]I'm just going to start at 2.
[168:52.34]I'm just going to do the thing that developers do and programmers do in coding when they make new pieces of software.
[168:58.20]I don't know.
[168:58.48]Was it like 1.1?
[168:58.90]Was it 1.12?
[168:59.38]Was it 1.012?
[168:59.64]Just make it 1.2.
[169:00.11]Make it 2.0.
[169:00.49]Turn it into 1.3. 1.4.
[169:17.43]Minus 2.0.
[169:17.87]Ah, get out of here.
[169:19.23]What did I order?
[169:19.85]Water on the rocks?
[169:21.15]No, that shit gets you thrown out.
[170:00.29]Where have you been?
[170:02.26]Busy trying not to get killed.
[170:05.33]So we're gonna cheat at the casino to the guy that's cheating.
[170:11.07]There's a guy cheating at the table already.
[170:12.87]We're gonna cheat to make him loot.
[170:34.50]Just got a fucking earpiece hanging up.
[170:42.91]Buy yourself something nice.
[170:47.18]That would have been great if they had just shown that and kept it there.
[170:49.82]What?
[170:50.64]What the fuck are they saying?
[171:14.32]Your Rob Lowe portion of the video game development here, sir.
[171:18.23]We just got a gem from the office.
[171:20.27]It's in every game.
[171:41.79]Okay, what do you mean right or left?
[171:43.19]What did I pick?
[171:47.91]This is not how you bet in blackjack.
[172:11.80]Easy, Jack.
[172:14.22]Take a hit.
[172:16.67]I bet right or left in blackjack?
[172:19.27]What?
[172:23.42]No, I wanted to hit.
[172:26.00]Too bad.
[172:27.10]We have all the Russian problems.
[172:32.87]You snooze, you lose.
[172:35.75]I just lost a million dollars.
[172:37.39]Because I stood on 16.
[172:38.45]What?
[172:39.27]What?
[172:53.87]No, I have to wing!
[172:59.42]Oh, no!
[173:01.92]Have I ever played blackjack?
[173:04.62]Yeah, I didn't know they said take a card.
[173:06.80]I didn't know what I was supposed to do.
[173:08.48]There was no button on the screen.
[173:13.86]There was no like, oh, button, press, yes, no.
[173:19.38]What?
[173:19.54]Oh, is that the guy?
[173:25.52]The guy on the plane?
[173:34.11]Oh, shit.
[173:38.03]No, not Rob Lowe, the guy that was on top of the plane.
[173:46.85]We made it to disc three.
[174:00.85]How many discs are there totaled?
[174:02.45]This is it.
[174:03.87]Three is the last one.
[174:08.18]16.
[174:08.96]Take a card.
[174:10.14]Take a card, Jack.
[174:11.92]I think I stood.
[174:23.15]So what the hell happens now?
[174:25.05]I think there's branching story in this.
[174:39.06]What I should have done, the real thing to do, would have been, depending on the disc.
[174:43.53]So we're on disc 3.
[174:44.63]This is disc 3 now.
[174:48.07]Right?
[174:48.37]That would have been smart if I had done that.
[174:50.69]Should have done 2.
[174:53.47]21, 22, 23, 24.
[175:05.65]Lisa, you too?
[175:07.51]Jack, it's not what you think.
[175:09.05]The Wolf is working with the CIA to help stop the launch.
[175:12.17]Only half right.
[175:13.53]We're working with the Wolf.
[175:14.81]No, but you told me that... That mushroom cloud will send our budget sky high.
[175:19.38]Wait, it's a total double cross here.
[175:22.38]You are sick.
[175:24.08]What do I do?
[175:38.06]I can't block... Did I... lose?
[175:42.02]What?
[175:42.20]I thought I just, like, died after saying that.
[176:09.99]Left toe, big foot, shake my legs, and... Going good.
[176:18.54]MI5 has recently passed on some information.
[176:24.48]Shoot the special.
[176:25.82]Cheers.
[176:42.45]I didn't touch that, he did.
[176:43.63]I need to save this.
[176:49.82]Holy shit, that, that, wait, wait, hold on a minute.
[176:52.90]That's a, that was true.
[176:54.50]Somebody said that.
[176:55.74]The amps, it's the fucking amps.
[176:59.90]That's a callback from a couple days ago when I said 10 million volts.
[177:04.62]And then somebody corrected me and said, Jeremy, you're an idiot.
[177:07.84]It's not the volts.
[177:08.71]It's the amps that actually electrocute you.
[177:10.31]And I was like, oh, okay, sorry.
[177:11.39]Well, then it was the amps.
[177:12.67]And then somebody else in chat said that that was a lie.
[177:16.63]And that person was fucking with me.
[177:17.83]And it actually is the volts that electrocute you.
[177:20.97]So, I guess this game decided that that's the decider there.
[177:27.28]It's the watts that kill you.
[177:30.34]They both matter.
[177:32.30]Well, either way.
[177:44.55]It's the electricity that kills you.
[177:49.31]Going good.
[177:51.15]MR5 has recently passed on some information.
[177:54.09]Shoot the special.
[177:54.89]Cheers.
[177:55.29]Here we go.
[177:55.69]Hey, guys.
[177:56.04]What's up?
[178:11.15]Oh no, the two-person horse jump!
[178:13.19]The two-person horse jacket bit!
[178:14.59]Oh, great.
[178:53.41]Got him.
[178:56.19]Nice.
[178:57.23]Kick.
[178:59.49]He's done.
[179:02.03]Kick again.
[179:02.43]Punch.
[179:12.64]How long does this guy take to die?
[179:32.51]How do I do this?
[179:34.55]Do I have to walk away?
[179:35.85]Leave?
[179:36.69]S. Up.
[179:40.25]Yeah.
[179:43.12]It was turn around.
[179:43.84]It actually... It was turn around.
[179:56.20]Kick.
[179:57.33]Good.
[179:59.45]Don't.
[180:00.99]Come on.
[180:06.14]Good jabs.
[180:06.54]Shit!
[180:09.56]Did I get him?
[180:17.17]I tripped him.
[180:18.01]Ooh, that was a good one.
[180:30.07]Now what?
[180:36.44]I think I have to turn around again.
[180:37.56]He's just sitting there waiting.
[180:48.57]I hate this.
[180:50.11]I hate this, but I love it at the same time.
[180:59.43]Shit.
[181:03.49]Down.
[181:04.33]Down him!
[181:07.44]Down him!
[181:11.24]Don't, alright.
[181:18.09]First try.
[181:19.15]I got it.
[181:22.85]And the head's together.
[181:24.75]Free Stooges style, aww.
[181:49.50]I cannot wait to save this.
[181:51.16]Because I don't want to do that again.
[181:56.90]Alright, here we go.
[182:11.83]Jack Fremont, you're under arrest.
[182:13.89]What?
[182:14.31]Oh yeah?
[182:16.09]Yeah.
[182:20.41]Oh, alright then, in that case.
[182:26.51]You can't lock me up in here.
[182:28.33]Can't I?
[182:29.55]Let's see.
[182:30.53]We have over 200 murders, 100 random acts of violence, property damage totaling in the millions.
[182:36.58]Miss Police Captain, I think you're trying to seduce me.
[182:40.04]Vandalism.
[182:40.76]Vandalism never.
[182:41.86]In case you haven't realized it, buddy, you do not have a license to kill or tell bad jokes.
[182:47.82]Let's see what we have here.
[182:52.43]What's in there?
[182:52.99]What's in there?
[182:54.87]That's a pretty good Joker, Lef.
[183:05.90]I would rank that at, like, top five.
[183:23.12]He still has the backpack on him?
[183:49.98]No.
[183:50.30]Yeah, he does.
[183:51.59]It's over his right shoulder.
[183:52.87]That's un-fucking-believable.
[183:57.01]That's actually ridiculous.
[184:06.81]Whatever they pay you, it is not enough.
[184:09.35]I expect you still want to stop those awful Russians.
[184:12.15]Thought I'd crossed my mind.
[184:13.93]Well, I've got to get you out of here.
[184:16.62]I'm not getting in there.
[184:17.74]Don't worry.
[184:18.94]Just flush on my cue.
[184:21.44]Flush and stand back.
[184:23.26]Back.
[184:23.94]God, flush, my boy.
[184:25.36]Flush.
[184:34.70]So what happened to Jean Parmesan?
[184:37.16]Is he still alive?
[184:42.10]Did Jean Parmesan just sacrifice himself to get me out of jail?
[184:51.42]That would hurt so bad.
[184:53.66]He took that really well.
[184:54.62]Where are we?
[185:13.52]Where's the fancy cars?
[185:14.80]The beautiful women?
[185:15.90]Uh, no car, um... Lost a woman somewhere and, uh, guaranteed our own nuclear destruction.
[185:21.24]Drake and Josh.
[185:22.23]Bummer.
[185:22.85]Hey, is this CD your clue?
[185:24.27]Yeah.
[185:25.25]It's over.
[185:26.81]Ladies, our secret weapon has arrived.
[185:30.51]How you doing, coach?
[185:31.89]Drake and Josh.
[185:34.35]Not quite.
[185:35.41]I think they decoded something in crossing the X and the Y pins.
[185:41.64]Fremont.
[185:42.72]What?
[185:42.86]Fremont.
[185:44.36]Here.
[185:45.46]Oh.
[185:47.60]So, Humancorp hired you to throw us off the trail.
[185:53.03]Godfly and Goodfoot.
[185:54.63]Bad acting, bad wardrobe, and bad luck for you.
[185:58.41]There is a fourth disc.
[186:00.11]Tri-Ambassador Hotel, Virchow Boulevard.
[186:03.43]You got a car, Freddy?
[186:04.49]Yeah.
[186:05.41]You keep the XBT 5000.
[186:06.09]I'll get a ride.
[186:11.08]I kind of wish he had his thing around his eyes.
[186:16.76]He felt like a superhero.
[186:18.32]I want like a superhero sidekick for him.
[186:20.30]Uh-oh.
[186:21.90]I...
[186:37.38]I'm incredibly confused.
[186:43.49]The New World Order will be based on software.
[186:47.99]Planes, tanks, missiles, all are obsolete.
[186:51.79]Ideas, entertainment is where the real power lies.
[186:56.27]With Hollywood gone, where will the world get the entertainment and software that it craves?
[187:02.38]In Russia, there are brilliant scientists, engineers, software designers, writers, actors, directors.
[187:09.52]All are starving in a few moments.
[187:15.98]For who rules with ideas rules the world.
[187:20.66]Where?
[187:21.60]My country, of course.
[187:25.25]It'll never work.
[187:26.25]It already has.
[187:28.29]Three quarters of all the world's modems are hooked to this building.
[187:32.81]Soon, the world will experience its most bizarre and horrible nuclear accident yet.
[187:40.36]I mean, this is, remember, this is back in the 90s, guys.
[187:42.76]There were probably only, like, 125 modems on Earth in, like, 1992.
[187:47.80]All telecommunications will be switched from the United States to Moscow.
[187:55.02]Okay, it'll work.
[187:57.30]Why are you telling me this?
[187:58.61]It's customary in American entertainment for bad guy to tell good guy what he's doing just before he kills him.
[188:08.05]He forgot.
[188:10.90]That really is just a Jim Carrey impression.
[188:15.60]It is.
[188:15.98]With, like, the wrist slap and, like, that one thing I forgot to tell you.
[188:25.85]Save it.
[188:30.45]It would just make it so much better if he just said, like, Take care now.
[188:34.15]Bye-bye then.
[188:35.32]and then dove to the left.
[188:38.06]You know he's gonna do something like that.
[188:39.29]I think he already has, actually, like three times.
[188:50.13]It'll never work.
[188:50.91]It already has!
[188:53.22]Three quarters of all the world's modems are hooked to this building.
[188:57.74]Soon, the world will experience its most bizarre and horrible nuclear accident yet.
[189:05.98]This is the greatest story of all time.
[189:08.84]We're like over three hours in.
[189:11.76]This is probably the end.
[189:13.06]I don't know who that is.
[189:14.37]I kind of do.
[189:35.45]You forgot.
[189:35.85]The good guy always wins.
[189:37.03]The good guy always wins.
[189:40.13]Oh, really?
[189:44.64]That was a really moment.
[189:52.44]Chauncey, get down.
[189:54.98]Here, take this.
[189:55.50]Is this the guy on the toilet?
[189:57.14]What does it do?
[189:58.42]Shoots bullets.
[190:00.80]Lots of them.
[190:02.02]Cool.
[190:03.04]What does this do?
[190:24.56]What?
[190:25.76]That guy didn't even try to attack.
[190:27.00]He was just a model.
[190:30.64]Stay down, my boy.
[190:31.36]You'll likely be hit.
[190:32.94]Thanks, because this isn't my tux.
[190:35.33]Got him.
[190:50.31]Absolutely fabulous day for sporting
[191:01.41]This is so bad.
[191:05.13]What?
[191:05.39]No, the guy.
[191:05.93]The guy that... The sitting still guy.
[191:09.98]The guy that didn't do anything.
[191:13.32]Really?
[191:13.66]That's the guy that kills me?
[191:16.10]Chauncey, get down.
[191:35.41]Here we go.
[191:35.87]That guy disconnected.
[191:37.03]GDC.
[191:37.23]Oh my god.
[191:37.75]What the fuck was that?
[191:38.55]There he is.
[191:38.99]Nice.
[191:39.19]Okay, don't die.
[192:08.21]Got him.
[192:10.03]Good shot.
[192:19.82]Get him!
[192:20.46]Just the skiing thing again.
[192:37.95]Did it burn me?
[192:39.47]What?
[192:39.87]Oh no.
[193:09.43]Get him!
[193:12.31]Shit!
[193:13.07]No!
[193:13.43]What?
[193:13.75]Oh, he got me in the groin.
[193:39.55]Shit, I gotta do this shooting again.
[193:40.77]Damn it.
[193:41.13]Huh?
[193:41.25]I switched hands.
[194:11.48]I just pretended to get shot.
[194:51.54]Alright, here we go.
[194:53.85]Explain the plot?
[194:54.59]I have no idea.
[194:56.31]Hold on, I need to fight this guy.
[194:58.95]How do I fight the guy with the weapon in his hand?
[195:03.81]Block?
[195:04.87]Punch?
[195:05.25]I wonder.
[195:05.79]Maybe block?
[195:06.41]I'm gonna have to start blocking.
[195:13.13]The video's lagging.
[195:23.23]No, shit!
[195:24.65]I broke- wait, I broke it!
[195:25.51]No, I didn't.
[195:31.62]I don't think saving's gonna do anything.
[195:32.72]I think saving puts you back here.
[195:35.89]I'll try it next time.
[195:51.06]I'm just gonna take a guess at what to do against that guy with the fucking spear.
[195:55.26]Fuck!
[196:20.16]He's trying to skip it.
[196:23.68]Oh, by the way, the walkthrough does not say what to do against the big guy.
[196:29.39]There's no info here.
[196:41.49]I might softlock myself here, not being able to kill this guy.
[197:07.59]I love that so much.
[197:08.47]Alright, give me some help here.
[197:18.21]What should I try?
[197:19.35]Punch him?
[197:24.19]Punch, block?
[197:25.19]I tried dodging and blocking.
[197:26.49]Alright, I'll save it right here.
[197:38.25]Here we go.
[197:43.93]Dodge.
[197:45.53]What?
[197:46.53]Lovely tuxedo.
[197:50.66]Thanks.
[197:51.10]Nice hair, too.
[197:52.92]I have no... Missed me.
[197:56.94]No, you didn't.
[198:04.55]Was it that long to do that?
[198:07.16]Did you really just do that?
[198:10.70]I really just lost.
[198:19.12]Thank God you guys were right.
[198:26.11]No!
[198:46.79]God damn it!
[198:47.99]No, he... God damn it.
[199:00.61]I wonder if it's when he has the thing, he spins it around like that.
[199:04.36]I wonder if it's a kick.
[199:07.98]It's a punch when it's in the air?
[199:09.26]No.
[199:09.98]When he spins it, I'll try kicking.
[199:13.46]Haha, you missed.
[199:21.74]I have no fucking idea.
[199:24.69]Kick!
[199:24.93]No, he wouldn't!
[199:29.69]He keeps going for the... Agh!
[199:59.24]I don't think... Okay, when I dodged it last time, we got that cutscene.
[200:06.09]I hit him there.
[200:06.67]I hit him there.
[200:11.44]No.
[200:12.30]Dead.
[200:16.48]This is definitely one of those scenarios where it's going to be like, you have to block the first one, punch the second time, punch the third time, kick the fourth time or something.
[200:25.13]I have no idea what order it is.
[200:29.97]Any other guides?
[200:32.65]You guys got any other guides?
[200:37.31]I typed in fox hunt guide and it's like fox hunting tips.
[200:40.98]I don't know.
[200:41.66]I don't want to do that.
[200:42.38]I want to fucking know how to play the game.
[200:45.77]The same guide, uh, does not have it.
[200:52.67]No one's ever got this far.
[200:56.83]Hold on.
[201:02.53]Just push buttons?
[201:03.31]No, you have to time it.
[201:03.93]Let me try this.
[201:12.66]Alright.
[201:22.85]Okay, I'm spamming one.
[201:31.59]Did I get it?
[201:33.05]I literally just pressed one as fast as I could.
[201:36.33]What?
[201:37.27]Is this guy still alive?
[201:41.21]Why can he not get up?
[201:43.09]Wait, why is it cutting?
[201:45.63]He's on the ground and then he's here.
[201:49.73]I don't get it.
[201:50.75]Why does he keep... Turn around?
[201:57.94]I can't.
[201:59.14]The turn around button doesn't do anything.
[202:03.80]What the fuck?
[202:04.62]I had to left.
[202:05.46]I had to press left.
[202:26.10]Okay, there's two down.
[202:32.46]Last one.
[202:41.01]Is this guy a caveman?
[202:44.03]Oh shit, he's gonna win.
[202:47.91]God damn it, he's a club.
[202:50.36]Please!
[202:52.48]No!
[202:52.90]That scream.
[202:56.72]Alright, I know how to beat the first two.
[203:21.12]Okay, second guy!
[203:22.90]Last guy!
[203:50.30]There's another one?
[203:51.20]Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[204:05.06]I have to go through the gauntlet.
[204:06.30]Are you shitting me?
[204:07.34]Wait.
[204:10.36]Come on, kick him.
[204:19.70]You only got one of... There's two more.
[204:20.78]There's two more.
[204:21.62]Holy shit.
[204:21.90]This is... There's so much overstimulation here.
[204:48.78]Uh, I don't remember.
[204:49.38]38?
[204:49.40]39?
[204:49.42]I don't know.
[204:49.94]You know, I really would have loved the one guy to have the death scene to be the caveman.
[205:22.70]What the hell?
[205:23.42]Aren't we in, like, Vegas still?
[205:25.28]This is the basement somewhere, right?
[205:28.42]No.
[205:29.14]Where are we?
[205:29.62]Am I gonna play the video game in the video game?
[205:33.42]Is that what they're going with here?
[205:35.66]It is.
[205:49.06]What?
[205:49.30]Hey Jack!
[206:04.93]Are you looking for someone, Jack?
[206:07.13]Actually, I'm next in line for Street Fighter.
[206:09.83]I'm just waiting for Jean-Claude.
[206:11.50]Jean-Claude?
[206:12.88]Oh, well, this is high score!
[206:15.74]Herbert!
[206:16.76]Yeah!
[206:17.86]He's a world champion!
[206:20.49]This kind of freaks me out.
[206:21.61]It's not the vault.
[206:22.35]Why is she waving?
[206:57.03]Why?
[206:58.17]Did he punch that guy?
[206:59.33]Here we go.
[207:09.74]He's using the hands.
[207:11.36]Kicks.
[207:12.38]Punch.
[207:12.70]Back to the punch.
[207:13.20]Did I chip a tooth?
[207:29.33]He's letting me win.
[207:30.47]Now for Fast Fremont's Five Fingers finale.
[207:35.29]One, two, three.
[207:37.84]One, two, three, four, five.
[207:43.64]Ooh.
[207:45.10]Hi.
[207:47.14]I need to grab something.
[207:49.80]I know.
[207:50.38]I don't have a date.
[207:52.94]You want to dance with me?
[207:54.70]I love your hair.
[207:59.38]Am I gonna zap this guy?
[208:00.78]I still don't understand the plot.
[208:08.47]Score ranking number one.
[208:33.48]That's a pretty good Joker laugh.
[208:35.50]Not bad.
[208:36.24]He's still alive.
[208:44.35]Oh no.
[208:46.37]Oh my god.
[208:47.19]I broke a nail.
[208:48.84]I could just die.
[208:52.76]Launch in 7, 6, 3...
[208:56.39]Do I launch?
[208:58.98]Launch.
[208:59.42]Wait.
[208:59.78]I don't think I was supposed to do that.
[209:08.30]What do I bother?
[209:09.88]Answer me that, Primo.
[209:11.00]Maybe it's because UBC has never had a good Friday night lineup.
[209:14.16]Jack.
[209:16.84]After eight years, you're finally a sophomore.
[209:20.51]I'm proud of you, son.
[209:21.93]I love that show.
[209:22.95]It was canceled.
[209:32.72]I'm just gonna leave?
[209:38.78]Finally lost the backpack.
[209:40.00]Why?
[209:40.18]Oh no, he's behind me!
[209:42.43]I counted your machine gun shots.
[209:45.35]Where are you going?
[209:45.83]I'm following you!
[210:02.16]Save the game.
[210:08.68]You shot hundreds and hundreds of times.
[210:11.32]I'm gonna just go with 40 because I don't know.
[210:20.17]Is that a rocket ship?
[210:23.67]This thing work?
[210:24.67]Frankly, I haven't got the slightest idea.
[210:31.00]This is a Batmobile?
[210:32.93]Where the fuck are we right now?
[210:34.53]Hi.
[210:34.73]Am I supposed to be picking?
[210:37.89]Hi.
[211:29.00]Maybe it's the arrow keys.
[211:38.40]Left?
[211:38.88]Right?
[211:39.14]Okay, I just pressed right.
[211:40.84]Yeah, it's the arrow keys.
[211:47.03]Why is the top key coming off?
[211:53.14]Blue?
[211:54.20]The different colored hallways.
[211:57.09]Green and red, and then... What was that?
[212:05.78]This pops up so fast, I can't even... Who's shooting at me?
[212:28.46]Um... I... What?
[212:33.85]Um... I...
[213:20.07]How do I stop this guy from shooting at me?
[213:25.01]When the guy's in front of you, shoot.
[213:26.69]Shoot.
[213:28.94]Oh, for the love of fucking God, you have to hit enter.
[213:32.32]You're not clicking on the screen.
[213:50.22]What?
[213:55.16]Was I shooting in front of me?
[214:03.38]I pressed F. Alright, but who is he?
[214:06.15]Where the fuck is he?
[214:07.79]Where is this person?
[214:09.69]Who is that and where are you?
[214:13.31]What?
[214:19.27]Behind me?
[214:19.85]Wasn't I just looking behind?
[214:26.11]So he's behind me, so I have to, like, turn.
[214:29.51]I can't turn.
[214:30.09]Alright, once he starts firing, I can't do anything.
[214:37.20]And I can just look behind me.
[214:40.98]What the fuck?
[214:49.84]You have to get out of the rocket and just wait.
[215:01.71]I- Where the fuck is he going?
[215:03.93]If I go- Green or red?
[215:14.66]What?
[215:30.44]I can't fucking even see what I'm supposed to be doing here.
[215:42.06]I'm looking at the guide.
[215:43.60]Look down the tube to see which way the guy is going.
[215:51.53]What?
[215:53.27]Do you see a guy going down a tube right now?
[215:58.16]Where?
[215:59.94]I didn't see shit!
[216:02.28]Which tube?
[216:03.40]There's nobody there!
[216:04.18]And now he's behind me!
[216:27.73]The object here is to shoot the bad guys ahead of you and avoid the gunfire from behind.
[216:31.14]The trick is to maneuver the guys from behind you to in front of you while spinning to avoid their gunfire.
[216:36.67]Spinning.
[217:05.27]Spinning.
[217:11.54]This is going too fucking fast, man.
[217:13.50]I can't even make a choice.
[217:16.00]Spin.
[217:33.59]Huh?
[217:34.65]Who is who?
[217:52.44]Shoot him!
[217:59.72]I think I got him.
[218:09.28]Spin.
[218:09.98]Spin.
[218:12.44]What the fuck?
[218:47.39]No!
[218:47.83]What the f- This is the most confusing shit fucking ever.
[218:55.83]This is the wheelchair rockets with guns.
[219:23.95]Spin?
[219:24.83]Spin.
[219:29.41]How the fuck is this guy always behind me?
[219:35.46]This is the final scene of the game.
[219:37.84]I have to beat this.
[219:39.56]As fucking stupid as this is.
[219:50.40]Those last four or five... These...
[219:55.65]You couldn't pay me money to tell you what the fuck is happening right now.
[219:58.90]Shoot!
[220:04.73]I didn't even press the spin button once.
[220:06.47]I didn't press S one fucking time.
[220:29.60]This guy is still here.
[220:31.40]Why is he still here?
[220:37.21]Spin!
[221:05.39]He's dodging?
[221:06.86]How are you dodging?
[221:14.50]Hello?
[221:15.79]What?
[221:18.43]The name is Jack.
[221:20.33]Jack Fremont.
[221:23.31]Did he say yak?
[221:47.25]How the fuck did that even make any sense?
[221:51.28]Oh, I love this game.
[221:54.72]But I hate this game at the same time.
[221:56.18]I think this is the end.
[222:02.08]Is it one more decision?
[222:02.82]Good work, Jack.
[222:04.16]Thank you.
[222:05.35]Been a bad luck, though.
[222:07.59]Those missiles are on their way.
[222:08.89]Anything we can do?
[222:11.37]Nothing.
[222:12.29]Oh, a glass of wine?
[222:14.43]Wait.
[222:14.75]Thank you.
[222:15.65]Lovely molo.
[222:18.03]I didn't stop the nuke.
[222:20.17]1966, Spring Harvest.
[222:22.43]Thank you.
[222:23.19]Jack.
[222:23.57]Wait.
[222:25.90]I thought I'd never see you again.
[222:35.54]Didn't she get shot?
[222:36.68]Well, in another two minutes, she won't.
[222:43.85]She got shot like point blank in the chest.
[222:54.54]If this ends with the nuclear bomb going off, end credits.
[223:00.24]I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
[223:31.29]It actually happened.
[223:32.39]It actually happened.
[223:33.63]I can't believe it.
[223:41.89]They actually did one of the end- there's multiple endings.
[223:52.68]How do you get the good ending?
[224:03.62]Yeah, that's it.
[224:08.16]That was fucking ridiculous.
[224:10.68]Okay.
[224:13.71]That was Fox Hunt.
[224:15.15]We beat the whole game.
[224:18.17]It was an absolute journey.
[224:22.76]It was a mess.
[224:24.22]It was all over the place, but you know, I enjoyed my time.
[224:28.74]Didn't beat the whole game.
[224:29.66]Well, I got to the end.
[224:30.68]I got to one of the endings.
[224:34.94]You have to complete the hospital wheelchair scene on your first try.
[224:37.46]Dude, that seriously almost killed me.
[224:42.31]This game is outrageous.
[224:43.31]Fox Hunt.
[224:48.39]By Capcom.
[224:52.65]Weirdly enough, I'm still trying to get over the fact that Rob Lowe was in the game for less than five minutes.
[224:59.65]He was just in the game.
[225:01.62]And a couple clones.
[225:04.92]That must have been a favor.
[225:06.60]You know, he must have known the DP or something.
[225:09.12]It must have been a personal friend.
[225:11.88]Hey, you want to be in this movie?
[225:13.48]This movie game thing for like five minutes?
[225:15.67]Just cameo it for fun?
[225:16.73]Yeah, sure.
[225:17.13]Why not?
[225:24.39]Killer soundtrack.
[225:35.29]There you go.
[225:36.97]Capcom.
[225:38.77]Capcom.
[225:39.35]Capcom.
[225:43.01]You gonna do New Game Plus?
[225:44.94]No.
[225:45.26]I'm gonna use the bathroom, come back, and I'm gonna play another one.
[225:49.66]And, unfortunately, there's really... It's out of the fryer and into the frying pan.
[225:55.48]Because the next one is... There's no relaxing FMV game that I have.
[226:02.11]From this point going forward.
[226:07.58]We are going to do, uh, Crime Patrol 2, Drug Wars.
[226:20.08]So, there really is no, there's no slowing down here.
[226:28.47]So, let me, uh, I'll be right back.
[226:29.45]I'm just gonna get a water, use the bathroom, and we'll keep going.
[226:34.24]I have the game that has rob schneider in it you're talking about a fork in the tail I really really wanted it but I had to make a decision because a fork in the tail seems ridiculous like this but it requires windows 95. so what I had to do I would have had to make a new virtual machine for windows 95 to only play that game so
[227:01.66]I decided to spend time in the Windows 3.1 emulator.
[227:09.38]Do it.
[227:13.21]I mean, I probably will.
[227:17.57]It's easy.
[227:17.97]Well, it's not that it's not.
[227:19.11]It's not that it's hard to do.
[227:20.35]It's just there was a shitload of games on the 3.1.
[227:23.90]And I said, alright, well, I might as well just focus on this.
[227:26.38]Because remember, I had to... There's a lot of fucking bullshit that you have to do to get some of these to work.
[227:35.62]And some of them, they don't work even with virtual emulation.
[227:41.35]So, virtual machine stuff.
[227:45.55]I tried to get... There are a couple other ones for 3.1 that I tried to get to work, and they just aren't going to, no matter what I do.
[227:53.30]Like, oh, you don't have QuickTime 1.0 installed.
[227:56.42]I refuse to run.
[227:58.36]But I have QuickTime 2.0 installed.
[228:00.20]That doesn't matter.
[228:01.32]Sorry.
[228:03.29]So I need to go find a 3.1 QuickTime 1.0 installation file.
[228:09.55]And then install it.
[228:10.37]And then hope it works.
[228:11.05]But I have to install it on the virtual machine.
[228:12.47]Like I have to go to like a super, super, duper, it's like, it's weird.
[228:17.49]And I've done that before.
[228:18.93]And then the whole VM breaks.
[228:24.36]QuickTime 2.0 doesn't exist.
[228:25.88]Yes, it does.
[228:45.42]This is QuickTime 2.1.
[228:55.53]Did somebody say QuickTime 2.0 doesn't exist?
[229:02.13]Hold on.
[229:03.65]I thought it didn't exist.
[229:05.11]I thought it didn't exist, though.
[229:07.96]I thought it didn't exist.
[229:16.92]Please hide this.
[229:18.03]I feel old.
[229:24.19]I disagree.
[229:24.75]What happens if you disagree?
[229:26.05]Does it turn off Windows?
[229:27.41]No.
[229:29.54]That's 2.1.2.
[229:29.80]Wait, that's 2.1.2, not 2.0!
[229:33.16]For a second I thought the camera was on, and I'm so glad it wasn't.
[229:43.91]That would have been embarrassing.
[229:45.75]Alright, I'll see you guys in a minute.
[229:47.93]We'll do, uh, Drug Wars.
[229:53.55]See you in a sec.
[230:07.84]Oh shit, his PC turned off.
[230:12.58]I'll be right back.
[230:13.54]Relax.
[235:05.31]Okay.
[235:06.43]We are no longer playing Fox Hunt.
[235:10.04]So I'm going to change that.
[235:13.30]This is Crime Patrol 2.
[235:14.42]Let me make sure it's being captured correctly.
[235:18.58]It is.
[235:27.11]Hello.
[235:34.56]Same thing, I got the three difficulties.
[235:38.32]Although, I'm probably gonna have to... I'm probably gonna have to resize this.
[235:43.63]Let me try something here, hold on.
[235:46.23]Does it stay the same, or is it all fucked up?
[235:51.69]I can't see.
[235:52.89]Yeah, I gotta change it.
[235:58.69]That looks okay, right... there.
[236:03.05]Maybe a little bit more.
[236:05.66]yeah that looks alright a little bit more looking good there we go okay turn the volume on and let's go we should be good right
[236:36.70]How loud is it?
[236:37.78]Probably very loud.
[236:41.66]No, it's fucked up.
[236:44.49]God damn it.
[236:47.63]Turn it down a little.
[236:50.17]Because I can't see it because it changes my resolution.
[236:53.67]I fucked it all up.
[236:59.93]There we go.
[237:00.27]Alright.
[237:01.69]Better.
[237:03.03]Here we go.
[237:03.76]New game.
[237:08.55]Welcome to Sierra County.
[237:10.27]Now, drugs are something we just don't abide down these parts.
[237:14.31]Actually, you got six years.
[237:15.13]What do you say you pick an assignment?
[237:18.45]You and me go kick a little butt.
[237:20.97]This is a really crunchy game.
[237:27.48]The director says take some target practice.
[237:29.54]I didn't train.
[237:41.24]American Laser Games.
[237:46.38]Why would you come up twice?
[237:53.48]Alright, here we go.
[237:55.50]Dealing dope.
[237:55.89]Behind the barrel.
[237:57.11]What else?
[237:57.49]I thought.
[237:58.13]I didn't know.
[238:16.57]That fucking hurts.
[238:18.41]That hurts in real life.
[238:19.53]Oh my god.
[238:20.13]I like this song.
[238:21.49]Unironically.
[238:22.03]I like that song.
[238:50.49]Who used to do this shit in the arcade?
[238:53.67]Same guy?
[238:54.33]He walked around the building.
[238:57.13]Oh no.
[238:59.30]Who's next?
[239:01.44]Where?
[239:18.93]Is this guy on his phone?
[239:20.87]He's trying to get good reception.
[239:22.69]He's like, yeah, can you hear me?
[239:29.62]Oh god dammit, okay.
[239:32.22]Look at this guy at the bar.
[239:45.27]He's trying to like talk to somebody on the phone.
[239:53.14]Ooh, nice job!
[239:54.16]Uh, this looks like Game Boy Color.
[240:07.44]That's just how it is.
[240:17.32]We have a driving shooting sequence.
[240:19.44]Great.
[240:19.74]These are always the worst because you can't tell what blob is the thing you're supposed to be shooting at.
[240:23.88]Like, I just guessed.
[240:31.81]I think I did it.
[240:38.65]Somebody help!
[240:52.66]Somewhere in there is a, uh, is a really cool scene.
[240:55.76]They're stashing drugs in this place.
[240:59.54]What do you say we get an old house for it?
[241:04.82]What?
[241:04.94]What?
[241:05.06]Who's dead?
[241:05.48]They're dead?
[241:05.91]So what's the deal?
[241:37.62]I don't know what exploded in there.
[241:39.62]Ugh!
[241:41.44]Oh, you just don't know.
[241:47.79]The special effects are crazy.
[241:53.57]American Lazer was really, really, really cool.
[241:57.19]They spent- they put a lot of time and a lot of money into the effects that they did in their games.
[242:04.57]What?
[242:05.29]Oh, come on Watch out on the left side Guy comes out here Right in front Get
[242:31.83]Shit, I thought the guy was dead.
[242:34.41]I thought he wasn't dead.
[242:35.19]Right through the door, and then left, right.
[242:42.46]Then there's a guy up top.
[242:43.48]There we go.
[242:44.82]Now what?
[243:11.08]Holy shit.
[243:16.33]This video.
[243:18.03]I shot between them, so that's good.
[243:19.35]Dude, that was not even a person back there.
[243:28.23]That was like a broom closet.
[243:30.75]It wasn't even a person.
[243:49.53]Did she say we're not worthy?
[243:54.23]You're a hot Christmas list, partner.
[243:56.03]It's showtime.
[243:57.83]Did we win?
[244:01.16]You got guts.
[244:01.82]Guts are good.
[244:02.58]You're heading north.
[244:04.32]Chicago.
[244:04.72]Show the big boys what you got.
[244:19.69]Don't look at the camera.
[244:22.31]Look at this outfit.
[244:23.51]Is this all the pizza?
[244:24.41]I want one of those so bad right now.
[244:26.17]I so desperately want one of those right now.
[244:49.11]I'll drop it in on the cartel.
[245:06.57]Look at back here.
[245:07.49]This is... That guy.
[245:10.54]Everybody just... Why do they all... It's so... It's... I can't help it.
[245:16.32]That was an innocent you shot.
[245:17.82]Big mistake.
[245:21.26]How is this one crunchier than the last one?
[245:23.03]This looks like it was painted frame by frame.
[245:49.26]Alright, watch out for the guy with the hard hat.
[246:06.63]Watch it.
[246:07.25]What?
[246:07.75]I thought that was my partner.
[246:14.52]Slugs ain't cool.
[246:15.74]Neither is your shooting.
[246:17.02]Later, dude.
[246:19.14]This is crustier than fox hunt.
[246:21.92]Wait, which one is it?
[246:22.68]This one?
[246:23.28]Okay, it is this one.
[246:28.42]Really?
[246:28.70]So what happened?
[246:29.64]What's going on?
[246:52.04]Did I lose too many times?
[246:54.68]I think I'm... Wait, but I was able to continue a bunch of times before.
[246:59.58]Huh.
[247:28.13]Time to get good, apparently.
[247:29.74]Yeah, right.
[247:31.84]Right when I... Shit.
[247:40.49]Well, I'm gonna save the game when I beat... Oh, goddammit.
[247:48.65]It's even on Wimpy, too.
[248:02.67]Alright, good.
[248:03.05]Let's go.
[248:03.93]Save game.
[248:06.69]That's all it takes.
[248:08.42]The guy just tells it.
[248:09.14]He just speaks it.
[248:09.96]Okay, fine.
[248:10.72]Sometimes you gotta scan back and forth like this.
[248:36.87]Good, we're in.
[248:39.65]Check out the guy on the phone.
[248:41.89]By the way, I- This is- That guy's like a fucking time traveler.
[248:48.53]They don't have cell phones.
[248:51.20]Back in the late 80s.
[249:07.96]What the hell was that?
[249:09.97]1993, there was no cell phones in 1993.
[249:37.16]And here it goes!
[249:48.29]See?
[249:48.49]I haven't even lost a life yet.
[249:52.79]This one's hard.
[249:53.29]I gotta remember, it's like bang bang bang bang bang.
[250:13.62]Yeah!
[250:13.80]Up in the damn window.
[250:14.68]I'm in the damn window of the house.
[250:16.90]Wait, I went... God fucking dammit, what am I doing?
[250:45.33]Bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, right here.
[250:49.73]Then up.
[250:51.05]Alright, we're in.
[250:51.99]Don't shoot.
[250:52.97]Guy behind him, in the corner.
[251:16.80]Done.
[251:16.92]Alright.
[251:17.35]Back to Chicago.
[251:19.19]Alright, let's do... Let's go with this one.
[251:22.87]In the middle.
[251:23.77]Quiet, please.
[251:47.51]Where?
[251:47.93]Where?
[251:48.21]Who?
[251:51.09]What?
[251:53.07]Sorry, partner.
[251:54.33]Maybe you should play an easier game.
[251:59.43]I don't... I don't know who the fuck I was supposed to be even looking at.
[252:02.20]How about a... This could be the end of the game.
[252:11.44]Or not.
[252:12.22]Come on, partner.
[252:13.20]Let's keep on going.
[252:17.28]No, no, no.
[252:18.26]I'm alright.
[252:18.70]Continue.
[252:19.26]Alright.
[252:19.78]Save game.
[252:23.42]Save.
[252:23.60]So this guy at the right and the guy on the left.
[252:26.06]The cartel's holding hostages in the courthouse.
[252:28.79]Hopefully they're all lawyers.
[252:32.89]We go right here.
[252:38.11]Now who?
[252:38.87]Where?
[252:41.62]What the fuck?
[252:42.88]How am I supposed to see?
[252:44.34]Later, dude.
[252:49.55]He's got to memorize where they are.
[252:50.79]So middle, left, and then right again.
[252:52.31]This guy gets up again.
[252:53.03]God damn it.
[252:54.09]Big mistake.
[253:18.25]Alright, not this guy then.
[253:19.51]This fucking lady in the front row!
[253:25.13]Come on, partner.
[253:30.70]Let's keep on going.
[253:50.63]Just got the call.
[253:51.61]The cartel's holding hostages in the courthouse.
[253:54.30]Hopefully... Okay.
[254:04.65]Okay.
[254:05.03]This lady turns around.
[254:21.36]Denon.
[254:22.26]Cartel.
[254:23.34]Wait.
[254:26.02]I'm so confused right now.
[254:27.60]What just happened?
[254:28.90]I don't understand.
[254:29.88]They was... Was that a...
[254:50.44]Nice try, but don't quit your day job.
[254:59.85]Just got the call.
[255:00.67]The cartel's holding hostages in the courthouse.
[255:03.23]Hopefully they're all lawyers.
[255:14.94]Twice.
[255:15.34]And then the guy spins, and then this guy on the left.
[255:21.45]Got on the left and then... Okay, then... Now this weird thing happens, where it's like... There's a little person here with the... security and... Oh, that guy went flying!
[255:59.25]Or not, come on.
[256:00.01]Alright, man.
[256:00.58]Let's keep on going Alright, I have to do Loaded Loaded
[256:30.37]What's going on?
[256:31.57]Why am I stuck here?
[256:34.53]Did I save and I was dead?
[256:35.75]I don't know.
[256:40.41]So can I go back to a different menu?
[256:48.12]Let me try if I do... What happens if I quit?
[256:53.02]You saved on the continue screen.
[256:54.58]Well, wouldn't that... Shouldn't that be able to...
[257:07.48]Right?
[257:10.74]How do you not save on the menu?
[257:12.12]Isn't that the... I feel like that's where you have to save the game.
[257:15.74]I don't know.
[257:18.60]Let's see if it works.
[257:20.75]Or maybe it's just going to get stuck here forever.
[257:23.99]Quiet, please.
[257:24.83]I'm thinking.
[257:25.49]Uh-oh.
[257:34.92]Is it because I'm talking?
[257:37.78]Should I stop talking?
[257:58.83]Didn't work.
[257:59.19]I'll reload it.
[258:00.83]Hold on.
[258:08.13]That's annoying.

[258:18.88]So, let me load it again.
[258:19.96]Actually, I don't even need to... No, I have to turn that off because it'll fuck up if I try to capture it.
[258:29.97]Alright, where is it?
[258:34.31]Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[258:35.31]You guys like to see this shit, don't you?
[258:38.51]There, okay, you can see it.
[258:43.76]See?
[258:43.98]Look at how smart I am.
[258:45.56]Actually, I don't know what folder it is.

[260:39.31]What the fuck?
[260:42.17]Alright, let's go.
[261:12.71]This is so much louder this time around, I don't know why.
[261:20.09]I like that the siren stops when you shoot.
[261:21.91]I like when they stop talking, too, and you're just like, okay, bye.
[261:40.56]That was I completely fucking missed.
[261:42.40]It's alright though Couple more
[262:22.36]Alright, I need to just get to Chicago and then I can go.
[262:32.95]And then save the game in the Chicago menu.
[262:36.41]I almost shot.
[263:07.85]Where was that outfit?
[263:16.17]The term is so dumb.
[263:22.92]Not yet.
[263:24.02]I just keep screwing up the whole transitioning scene thing.
[263:27.84]Alright, now... Right?

[264:25.84]Why?
[264:27.28]God.
[264:52.98]Oh, I keep everything so blurred in my brain because everyone's so blurry in the game.
[265:40.26]Guilty!
[265:42.02]Guilty.
[265:56.14]These people's faces are all mosaicked.
[265:59.20]Drugs ain't cool.
[266:12.14]I'm with the band.
[266:13.66]What do you mean the band?
[266:15.08]At the court?

[266:40.02]Okay, I did it.
[266:43.92]Let's go.
[266:50.14]Am I losing my mind, or is the game getting... Is the game looking worse?
[266:58.79]Am I crazy?
[267:00.27]Or have I just been staring at pixels that are so large?
[267:07.79]For the last, like, four to five hours.
[267:09.55]That, like, it's... It's messing with my head.
[267:35.18]Oh my goooooood.
[268:27.45]I'm giving this like a few more attempts before I fucking delete

[269:24.88]I didn't see that guy.
[269:50.06]Oh, my God.
[269:51.36]I can't believe you did that.
[269:57.83]You shot all the orange blobs on the screen, and then one that came up that was a blue blob.
[270:04.06]What were you thinking?
[270:05.64]Didn't we already do this?
[270:44.35]Guilty!

[274:25.57]There's no way to tell, man.
[274:28.09]There's no way- there's no way to tell.
[274:30.73]They're so out- they're so out of focus that there's no way you can tell them.
[274:39.80]Look at these guys on the left and right.
[274:52.27]This is the Canadian border?
[274:53.63]I don't... What do you mean Canadian border?
[274:57.41]Hey!

[276:39.51]Alright, that was wild.
[276:43.67]Looks like a party.
[276:44.63]Smells like a drug deal.
[276:48.13]Grab your piece and let's shot till they drop.
[276:50.75]Does it grab your pizza?
[276:52.21]What?
[276:52.87]Where?
[276:53.53]Who?
[276:53.97]What happened?
[276:55.46]Ben's gone down.

[277:13.97]One life.
[277:20.26]One life only.
[277:21.66]That's it.
[277:22.32]I can't make any mistakes.
[277:23.56]They came from the same exact place.
[277:55.37]Why did she scream into her hands?
[278:04.62]Extra crispy!
[278:06.10]She may have just been blowing her nose.
[278:33.35]Oh, I don't... Look at this!
[278:34.83]Am I in the car?
[278:56.53]Are you serious?
[279:01.49]What the fuck?
[279:02.69]I didn't even know we were going again!
[279:04.25]I'm dead again!
[279:08.99]Oh my god.
[279:26.22]So what has to happen is I have to die, and then I have to save with the one life.
[279:45.09]I thought this was the second scene and that was it.
[279:52.66]Okay, behind the water.
[280:02.35]That lady sounds like a seagull.
[280:23.15]Oh my fucking god, guys.
[280:27.45]That shit's not fucking possible.
[280:42.90]Loaded.
[280:47.84]What the fuck?
[280:51.01]Loaded.
[280:59.82]That was loaded.
[281:33.38]I don't have to see somebody all the way down there, do I?
[281:45.53]Ah!
[281:47.35]I think that was... Loaded.
[281:58.88]This guy's fishing.
[282:00.36]Of course it was.
[282:01.34]Okay.
[282:01.70]Here we go.
[282:40.06]It's too crusty.
[282:41.08]Oh my fucking god.
[282:46.77]There is no way for you to do this.
[282:49.61]I'm so close, I have to.
[283:26.45]Are you emulating this on a Nintendo?
[283:29.86]Don't make me laugh.
[283:32.12]What happened there?
[283:33.46]I clearly got him!
[283:35.40]Rewind that!
[283:36.52]Did you see that?
[283:53.51]Can I press the menu button during a round?
[283:55.70]I might be able to, but that's terrifying.
[283:58.00]Because if I try that, if I try to save it in the middle of one of these, it might not work and it might be really bad.
[284:04.61]I'll try.
[284:04.95]I'll try it.
[284:07.11]Let's try it.
[284:08.43]I'll give it a go.
[284:09.59]Let's see.
[284:22.18]I'm like... I can't let this game tilt me.
[284:25.48]Can I?
[284:26.36]Is that what's happening right now?
[284:27.66]That's not... That can't happen.
[284:53.29]Okay, here we go.
[284:55.80]Let's see if that person's right.
[284:57.38]If you're wrong, then I'm gonna exit the game.
[285:03.42]Save.
[285:11.81]Okay, like I told you, let's see what happens.
[285:15.11]Ready?
[285:17.11]Loaded.
[285:20.93]What?
[285:21.23]That person just saved the whole stream.
[285:45.51]this is risky yeah no I shouldn't wait what I just had an opportunity to save the game hold on I just freaked out
[286:36.26]Oh, you motherfucker.
[287:12.73]What are they saying?
[287:13.74]I have no idea.
[287:16.70]Why did you come out twice?
[287:19.14]Loaded.
[287:43.24]Oh!
[287:43.84]God, I was right there and I was quick.
[287:53.22]I was right there.

[288:51.02]That was an innocent person you shot.

[289:07.05]Loaded.
[289:08.23]Let's take him.
[289:15.78]Watch your aim.
[289:17.40]I keep shooting this person.
[289:19.18]Because it's impossible to tell.
[289:21.49]And sometimes, they throw it.
[289:30.05]It's random.
[289:33.28]See?
[289:48.29]This fucking guy keeps coming out of that window and it's fucking driving me crazy.
[290:17.03]Stop shooting the potty guy?
[290:18.59]What do you mean potty guy?
[290:20.03]I just got- everybody relax.
[290:21.47]I just gotta continue for that.
[290:54.32]It doesn't fucking matter.
[290:55.12]It's the same outcome.

[292:47.90]Oh, the party one.
[292:50.96]With the rocks and shit.
[292:54.58]I gotta get a good save point here.
[293:05.95]It doesn't make any fucking sense.
[293:10.71]It doesn't make any fucking sense.
[293:15.51]I tell you.
[293:16.06]It don't make no fucking sense.
[293:19.76]There's no fucking reason why.

[314:18.88]Oh!
[314:20.27]It's starting to blend together!
[314:22.43]Things are starting to blend in my brain, and it's getting to a point where I can't tell.

[317:35.80]I do have to reboot this, though.
[317:43.70]Put the BRB up.
[317:44.56]I keep thinking my webcam's on.
[317:45.74]It's freaking me out because I really don't have any clothes on.

[321:09.60]Alright, if I want Quick Race, One Race, Championship, Load Game, Demo, Options.

[322:09.56]Where's the cop?
[322:12.70]So this, it's a real road.
[322:18.81]This is horrible.
[322:21.73]God, why does that guy not fall?
[322:23.69]But I do.
[322:24.17]This guy can take a lot of pain, though.
[322:34.20]That's apparently...
[322:43.07]What the fuck happened here?
[322:44.29]Okay.

[325:11.78]I'm good.
[325:12.30]I just got here.
[325:15.14]Grid position.
[325:19.47]What does this mean?
[325:20.83]Long?
[325:21.19]Alright, what about... I can't select the track?
[325:29.50]Qualifying.
[325:30.18]Let's go.
[325:38.93]Could I... I don't even... Why are there... Why are there cars on this road?
[325:42.23]162 miles per hour.
[325:46.31]Jesus!
[325:46.47]A helicopter?
[326:12.26]Can you get arrested?
[326:13.06]Why are the planes flying that low?
[326:18.25]You can't get hit by a fucking plane, right?
[326:30.38]Are there any other buttons?
[326:43.05]Alright, I'm almost in eleventh gear.
[326:44.31]Maybe I shouldn't have done long.
[327:01.56]Did I qualify?
[327:02.26]Oh, this is lap two.
[327:04.38]Right, okay.
[327:29.05]I've not stopped going 162.
[327:30.29]Those are RPMs, not gears.
[327:41.45]Yeah, see, it goes... I'm in sixth, right?
[327:53.00]So what does it mean?
[327:53.63]Let me ask you guys something.
[327:54.77]Those of you guys that like cars.
[327:57.63]What does it mean when your car... So let's say you have an automatic, right?
[328:03.62]You're not driving a manual.
[328:05.40]And let's say that you're, you know, between 1 and like 2 RPM, right?
[328:10.34]On the bar there.
[328:12.23]Let's say that you're like you're going like 20 30 miles per hour and you start to go down to like 1 to 2 rpm, right?
[328:19.17]Why is it in the time?
[328:20.49]What was within you got somebody that knows about cars?
[328:22.27]Let me know what you think about this.
[328:24.33]So Why is it that sometimes when you slow down?
[328:30.21]If anybody's in here that knows anything about cars if you slow down between 1 and 2 rpm Why is it that the?
[328:40.70]Um, the car sometimes will... Alright.
[328:46.62]Hold on.
[328:48.16]It was the, like, binaural beats in my ears were fucking up my whole brain.
[328:51.36]I couldn't even talk to you guys.
[328:53.40]Um, anyway, so, when going between 2 and 1 RPM, sometimes I can feel the car, like, pulling up and down.
[329:01.94]Uh, gears.
[329:04.17]Why is that doing that?
[329:09.19]I can feel it.
[329:11.37]It's like... It's like, ah, it's annoying.
[329:18.83]It's downshifting.
[329:20.95]But every other car I've ever driven didn't have that problem.
[329:24.67]I didn't feel the car downshifting.
[329:29.41]I do now.
[329:29.99]Why?
[329:39.52]Where am I?
[329:44.96]It's probably fine.
[329:46.60]It means it has wasps in the car.
[329:50.54]Your gears are sloppy.
[329:53.00]Huh.
[329:56.91]Slip in transmission.
[329:58.15]What do I do about that?
[330:00.39]Is that a hard... Is that an easy fix?
[330:01.71]Is that just like a, hey, man, I make my transmission slip and fix it.
[330:11.25]It's not.
[330:12.67]What do you mean?
[330:13.93]How... What do you mean it's expensive?
[330:18.79]How expensive?
[330:27.98]It's a couple hundred to a few thousand.
[330:30.42]That's a huge ballpark, but... Am I getting... I'm getting some... Some... Slip... It's slipping...
[330:44.64]That's not good.
[330:47.30]I can feel it.
[330:47.94]It only happens between like 20 miles... between like 15 and 20 miles per hour.
[330:54.71]Doesn't happen any other time.
[330:55.61]Is there a punch?
[331:04.65]No.
[331:05.04]Of course... Why am I the only one that falls?
[331:13.82]First or second gear is fucked.
[331:20.76]They can't go anywhere.
[331:23.59]That apparently didn't get hit.
[331:25.49]Alright, I'm in third place.
[331:26.65]This is not bad.
[331:27.21]I have an opportunity here.
[331:30.97]To pass.
[331:32.19]And get in first place and win.
[331:36.61]How did they not get hit by that stuff?
[331:39.64]What kind of car do I drive?
[331:40.44]Well, that would actually probably help.
[331:42.98]I drive a Honda Civic, so maybe that would help.
[331:45.89]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[331:49.33]I just told people where my car was.
[332:09.53]Am I first place?
[332:19.05]Yeah, it's a 2023 Honda Civic.
[332:23.11]I got the new one early.
[332:25.81]Don't you guys know that they make these things fucking five years in advance to make sure they have a shitload of them so they can just keep... Oh, it's 2019.
[332:30.86]Here's the 2021.
[332:31.22]There's like fucking a thousand of these cars already made.
[332:46.60]Guys, new cars are like new Madden.
[332:51.70]They just do a little bit of an update.
[332:54.31]They change the paint, and they make it look shaped differently.
[333:06.83]And then they smash the thing into walls a bunch of times.
[333:09.61]And say, hey, we got this shape!
[333:12.96]Yes, it fucking better be.
[333:17.24]Don't you know?
[333:17.78]I mean, in every car commercial, we've got a five-star safety rating.
[333:21.32]Okay, if you didn't, I wouldn't have the car.
[333:22.50]What do you mean?
[333:27.80]The car's wicked fucking safe!
[333:30.00]Good.
[333:31.16]It should be.
[333:32.00]Absolutely.
[333:32.64]What do you mean?
[333:33.24]Why is it a selling point?
[333:38.70]Two-star safety.
[333:40.26]Yeah, nobody ever talks about how their car is a two-star safety car.
[333:44.57]They don't exist.
[333:47.52]Every car company likes to tout that.
[333:48.92]Well, let me tell you, ranked five star safety from yabba-dabba-doo associates.
[333:53.96]Okay, well, no one has a three or two star rated car.
[334:07.49]What does a two star rated car mean?
[334:09.03]Is it like Yelp?
[334:10.93]If you go to a two star restaurant, you're going to get like sick.
[334:14.09]So if you drive a two star car, does that mean that it's going to like break?
[334:27.98]I mean, I can understand four stars, five stars, but two?
[334:32.12]Mm-mm.
[334:33.10]I don't think there's any car manufacturer that has a two-star safety rating.
[334:42.41]If they do, the car is probably, like, 600 bucks.
[334:54.23]Am I gonna win?
[334:55.13]I'm in first place.
[334:57.62]Yeah, get the fuck out of the way, Toad!
[335:01.02]Always causing problems back here.
[335:03.14]Just lapped you.
[335:04.70]Going like two miles per hour.
[335:06.11]Oh, it's 30 laps.
[335:20.19]Shit.
[335:21.13]Why would anybody have a 30 lap race?
[335:24.33]You're gonna run out of gas before the race is over.
[335:37.89]I made it 30 laps?
[335:38.83]No, I made it 30 long!
[335:40.25]I didn't know what that meant.
[335:41.07]Alright, what about a one-star rated car?
[335:58.18]Does that exist?
[336:00.18]Wait, hold on.
[336:00.90]Let me answer that.
[336:01.48]Is a one-star safety rated car like a go-kart?
[336:06.22]Right?
[336:07.18]Do they rate those?
[336:08.08]Does like JD Power rate go-karts?
[336:24.32]This game... this game just sucks.
[336:29.74]I think I actually am gonna run out of gas.
[336:31.40]What's the left meter?
[336:34.77]Is that meter on the left gas?
[336:51.69]This is a shitty road rash.
[336:52.95]Yeah, this is a road rash without the rash, just the road.
[337:13.23]It is a real road though, they definitely drove around somewhere because that's a real place.
[337:18.39]That's real grass, real road.
[337:19.97]No, just 24 more of these.
[337:33.64]Finally, I saw somebody else crash.
[337:51.06]That was stupid.
[338:16.08]That was terrible.
[338:24.58]No, I want to turn it off 30.
[338:25.49]Oh my god.
[338:30.33]No, I want to turn this shit off.
[338:39.20]Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here.
[338:54.21]Oh, that was Psychomania.
[338:58.75]Pretty good.
[338:59.41]Pretty fun.
[339:01.23]Rage Quit.
[339:02.31]No, I pretty much saw everything there is to see in the whole game.
[339:04.78]Alright.
[339:14.58]Here's the plan.
[339:19.07]What do I got here?
[339:27.07]there are a few more but but don't act like you have a plan I do have a plan the plan is I'm going to I'm going to leave it up to you guys okay we've been doing a lot of fmv like the last three or four streams in a row have been fmv games okay
[339:57.26]So I'm streaming tomorrow.
[340:01.36]Tomorrow is the last stream that will be a video game stream before the carnival.
[340:10.41]So I'm going to ask you this very simple question with a poll.
[340:14.99]Do you want me to do more full motion video stuff tomorrow?
[340:22.88]Or do something else?
[340:29.78]I'm going to make the poll right now.
[340:31.86]That something else is just not FMV.
[340:35.22]Could be anything.
[340:38.94]But there are one, two, three, four.
[340:44.48]There are about four, give or take, FMV games left.
[340:49.74]That are going to take a long time to play.
[340:52.11]Kind of like the first one we did.
[340:58.35]I'm okay with holding onto these for another time.
[341:00.74]But let's put this in here.
[341:11.11]This is a simple yes or no question.
[341:12.69]Here you go.
[341:29.51]Interesting.
[341:29.97]Okay.
[341:34.05]Can you tell us what the FMVs are?
[341:36.49]Um, sure.
[341:39.25]They are... Flash Traffic.
[341:46.83]It's another one of those... Oh no, there's a plot that you need to stop.
[341:51.77]Kind of like the first game, but just not the same.
[341:55.35]There's Critical Path.
[341:58.19]The Hellcab.
[342:01.89]And Dracula.
[342:11.50]You never did the second Dragon's Lair?
[342:12.90]Oh yeah, I beat it.
[342:16.56]I beat all the anime.
[342:19.45]That hurt my whole head, but yeah, I did.
[342:29.01]So it looks like most people would like to see something else.
[342:32.25]We can change it up.
[342:33.51]It's been a lot of FMV.
[342:35.17]We've done like 10, 12 of these.
[342:39.68]It's an overstimulating thing.
[342:42.82]Alright.
[342:43.38]We'll do something else tomorrow.
[342:48.96]I will find something else to play tomorrow.
[342:52.32]And then, of course... No, whoops.
[342:54.66]Sorry.
[342:56.56]And then, of course, on the 16th is going to be the activity book stream.
[343:00.20]That stream's not going to be very long.
[343:01.61]That stream's only going to be probably a couple hours long.
[343:04.41]However long it takes to do the book.
[343:06.13]Because then I have to get ready.
[343:07.85]And that whole week is going to be setting up with all the location people and where we're going and get in touch with who's making the robots and getting them.
[343:22.10]It's going to be a whole ordeal.
[343:24.24]So I want to make sure that that's completely taken care of.
[343:27.20]And it's going to take me about a week.
[343:32.50]Robots, question mark.
[343:39.55]I am going to pin a tweet tonight.
[343:44.61]It's just going to be there for the next week and a half.
[343:48.19]Saying the date and the time, September 21st at 12 p.m.
[343:53.34]Eastern.
[343:55.68]And I'm going to make a command here as well.
[344:03.22]What is left for tonight?
[344:06.11]Well, I kind of.
[344:07.79]I don't know if I want to start these right now.
[344:12.95]Because they might take longer than a few hours.
[344:16.27]And it's been about six hours now.
[344:19.91]These FMV streams have been, besides the one that got cut off, they've been like a clean six hours.
[344:24.66]So that's good.
[344:28.10]And then obviously the bits and everything.
[344:29.18]So it ends up being like six and a half.
[344:30.96]Seven.
[344:32.28]So I like that.
[344:42.39]We'll hold on to them.
[344:45.71]How many robots do you have for the carnival?
[344:48.23]Those are spoilers.
[344:52.63]Am I going to keep it under wraps?
[344:55.03]I mean, not... Well, let's just put this way.
[344:59.19]There's more than one.
[345:00.92]There are more than two.
[345:03.84]There's more than two.
[345:04.50]Okay?
[345:06.06]There you go.
[345:10.52]I already told you how many.
[345:12.52]I did.
[345:13.46]No.
[345:14.16]Whoops.
[345:18.70]But, you know, yeah, I think we'll call it here.
[345:22.30]This is a good place to stop.
[345:24.39]The other ones, I'm certain, I know for a fact that these other ones are going to take more than a few hours.
[345:34.37]So tomorrow we're going to do something else.
[345:40.46]And I also want to be completely honest here.
[345:43.43]That fox hunt burnt, like, literally all of the fuel in my tank.
[345:50.69]That was some of the funniest fucked up shit I think I've ever seen in a game.
[345:55.39]So, the first three and a half to four hours of this stream was like all gas has been removed from the tank.
[346:01.89]But it was awesome.
[346:05.18]So yeah, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[346:07.26]We'll play a game, we'll hang out.
[346:08.86]Probably gonna be a chill stream the next couple streams.
[346:14.77]We're gonna dial back the insanity.
[346:16.93]We'll just hang out and do something.
[346:22.26]But, uh, with that... See you tomorrow.
[346:28.78]We'll do the bits.
[346:30.70]Scrolling back here.
[346:34.75]Play Monster Rancher 2.
[346:37.69]Monster Rancher 2.
[346:38.35]Okay.
[346:46.54]Memories.
[346:49.32]But, thank you DoorCube for the 250.
[346:53.44]VHS streams are always fun.
[346:54.98]You know what?
[346:56.08]It's funny you say that.
[346:57.44]Because, some of the, there are a lot of FMV games that are on VHS tapes.
[347:05.36]Somehow.
[347:06.42]There are, I was going to do a whole thing playing DVD games from special features discs.
[347:13.52]That is gonna take a whole ordeal getting that set up.
[347:17.42]You know when you buy, like, uh... The Lion King!
[347:21.22]New animated Blu-ray!
[347:22.90]And there's just a dumb fucking game on that disc?
[347:26.30]I was gonna get a shitload of them, that habit.
[347:27.76]We were just gonna play DVD games.
[347:36.83]So, like, you can potentially look forward to that at a later date.
[347:44.78]But not right now, and not for a while.
[347:49.56]There's a Garfield DVD game?
[347:50.86]Well, I'll have to get it.
[347:53.26]But thanks, Dorky, for the $2.50.
[347:54.62]Well, Jerma, with the activity book and carnival stream coming up, I think you know what the next big project is.
[348:00.35]An FMV game of your own.
[348:02.59]If you were to make an FMV game, how would it play?
[348:04.21]Would it be a point-and-click like Fox Hunt, or more like security camera like Night Trap?
[348:08.79]It's funny you say that.
[348:10.35]Because that's something that I've always wanted to do.
[348:13.67]I brought up making an FMV game, I'm talking years ago.
[348:19.46]More than a couple years ago.
[348:24.20]The problem with game development, and especially high budgeted development stuff, is that would need to be done the right way.
[348:34.73]Completely.
[348:37.32]That would be a lot of money, a lot of potential people involved.
[348:42.91]I would really need to get the right people involved in that.
[348:50.76]Because it costs lots of money just to hire people and be on a location somewhere.
[348:58.71]Even location scouting, guys, something that a lot of people don't understand about making a video or making streams or anything like that is finding a place that will let you do things.
[349:11.93]Like a studio space or like where I was doing the green screen stuff or the warehouse space or something.
[349:17.73]Finding those places, they're very, very, very fucking expensive.
[349:22.10]Thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars.
[349:31.56]So just filming it, just like principal photography for whatever it would be.
[349:38.80]I mean, you're talking about having to hire actors and people to make costumes and... Where are you going to film this stuff?
[349:45.79]Do you have the permits to film this stuff?
[349:49.55]Before even pressing record on the camera, you might be looking at $50,000, $60,000, $70,000, $100,000 worth of stuff.
[349:59.74]Now, some people... We're talking like an FMV game, right?
[350:05.91]If you grab a camera with a couple of your buddies and you make a movie, and you get permission to film on location somewhere, that's different.
[350:20.99]Hire random people from Craigslist.
[350:23.97]You still have to hire those people!
[350:27.74]But what would the gameplay be?
[350:29.44]I always... I wanted to make a Western.
[350:32.22]I think that old-school Western, like Mad Dog McCree, is just the pinnacle of full-motion video games.
[350:38.30]And I would want to make it authentic, too.
[350:39.64]I wouldn't... I don't want HD cameras.
[350:41.76]At all.
[350:42.40]If I was ever gonna do something like that.
[350:43.74]I want, like, 16mm film.
[350:52.24]This shit doesn't have to be 1080p.
[350:55.92]In fact, I don't want it to be.
[351:02.21]And have branching paths and stuff.
[351:04.93]I've given this way too much thought for something that's not ever going to happen.
[351:08.97]At least in the near or far future.
[351:13.52]But everybody does this.
[351:14.44]Everybody sits down and just thinks of, you know, it would be a great video game, I think.
[351:20.44]So, you just spitball.
[351:27.06]We can pull off miracles.
[351:30.22]There was a lot of money given, and I missed a big $50 donation.
[351:34.58]I'm certain of that.
[351:36.88]But Cat's Beanie, thanks for the $50.
[351:40.72]$50 from Cat's Beanie.
[351:43.00]And this is exactly what I was talking about.
[351:44.94]Not sure if you saw my big bits at the start of the stream.
[351:48.02]It's cool.
[351:48.44]If not, I was wondering what inspired you to do the Robot Carnival.
[351:56.34]I don't know.
[351:56.70]I just thought it would be fun.
[352:00.22]The original idea was I was gonna get a dunk tank and have chat control a pitching machine and then it was... Okay, how do you do that?
[352:08.11]I just thought that would be fun.
[352:09.71]I just thought that that's it.
[352:10.71]That was the only motivation or inspiration behind it.
[352:17.44]Because I was imagining everybody in the chat like fighting over the controls and me just talking shit.
[352:24.87]Sitting up there.
[352:26.41]And everyone, like, missing, and then trying to... We're gonna dunk him!
[352:29.61]You know, we're gonna dunk this motherfucker!
[352:31.07]And I'm just sitting there, like, with a cigar, like, you ain't gonna fucking dunk me.
[352:35.71]And then it evolved into a bunch of games and a bunch of stuff.
[352:44.07]So... I don't... I don't... Inspiration and motivation stuff for me really just stems from... I...
[352:53.37]I don't know.
[352:54.39]If I think something's funny or interesting and I think it's worth pursuing, I'll do it.
[352:59.16]That's really it.
[353:01.24]We're gonna dunk you.
[353:02.26]Good luck.
[353:04.76]Go for it.
[353:08.40]I wish you all the luck in the world.
[353:12.48]Because you're gonna be fighting with the person sitting next to you.
[353:16.71]Because they're gonna want to go left.
[353:18.43]They're gonna want to increase the speed.
[353:20.49]Somebody over there is gonna want to reduce the speed.
[353:23.71]Good luck.
[353:24.71]Oh, that person just like decided to turn it that way?
[353:26.83]Mm-hmm.
[353:29.35]I have faith.
[353:38.38]He's still gonna smoke a cigar.
[353:43.56]We're gonna get you in 10 seconds.
[353:44.98]I would be shocked if you dunked me in 10 seconds.
[353:52.75]There is almost no way that's possible unless that every single person works together.
[354:02.20]No fucking way.
[354:06.58]Let's practice.
[354:07.52]Okay, let's practice.
[354:31.12]You're spoiling commands?
[354:33.47]I don't know if these are the commands or not.
[354:35.43]We have to go over that.
[354:38.57]Increase speed.
[354:39.53]5,000.
[354:40.35]Yeah, Twitch could beat Pokémon.
[354:43.39]I'll get dunked.
[354:45.17]Or maybe I won't.
[354:50.33]I'm not gonna make it easy for you.
[354:52.75]Just thinking face on that one, guys.
[354:55.11]You know, get your brain cap on.
[354:56.61]Thinking face.
[354:57.35]I'm not gonna make it fucking easy for you.
[354:59.55]Thinking face.
[355:01.00]Hmm.
[355:04.75]Uh, Phylactery Lich gave 100 bucks.
[355:12.01]They say fund it.
[355:17.31]More money from Phylactery.
[355:18.97]More hundreds and hundreds of dollars.
[355:21.23]Hundreds of them.
[355:23.63]Thank you, Phylactery.
[355:24.47]Thank you, Catsbeanie, for the donation earlier, too.
[355:26.61]Hope that answers your question.
[355:33.00]Thank you.
[355:36.58]They also say, will there be a birthday stream after the carnival?
[355:38.82]That's Cat's Beanie as well.
[355:40.28]So thank you for the hundred bucks, Cat's Beanie.
[355:42.40]Birthday?
[355:42.91]No.
[355:44.43]I... I'm gonna be... I'm not gonna be around.
[355:49.61]I'm gonna be... out of commission.
[355:54.29]Probably until the 24th.
[355:57.19]Of September.
[355:57.63]23rd or 24th.
[356:05.07]And then I'm back.
[356:07.89]And then by then, you know, it's time.
[356:10.25]I'm streaming.
[356:11.25]I gotta stream.
[356:14.64]Like I said, I think I said this yesterday.
[356:16.04]I don't want a scenario where I stream one time in two weeks.
[356:20.48]If I can help it.
[356:21.18]I'd like to keep broadcasting.
[356:24.20]Because then TwitchCon is that next weekend.
[356:25.64]A lot of shit going on.
[356:31.34]But.
[356:33.58]Maybe.
[356:33.80]I don't know.
[356:34.22]We'll see.
[356:36.56]But thank you.
[356:39.85]Yeah, I mean that's the whole point of doing something like the carnival.
[356:43.25]Is to make sure that I continue to stimulate myself.
[357:03.29]I get bored really, really easily.
[357:06.00]And when I get bored, I start to not care about something.
[357:11.62]So that hasn't happened yet on stream, for streaming.
[357:16.26]And I don't want to have it get there, because once it becomes boring, it... I'm going to parrot what I said yesterday.
[357:21.55]Once it becomes not interesting and boring to me, is when I would just... hang my hat up and be like, that was fun.
[357:37.02]I don't see that happening anytime soon.
[357:39.95]But, when it does, and if it does, then, you know, you have to start to, you know, you close the book, and you open up a new one.
[357:50.43]This is a good final stream.
[357:52.71]This one right here.
[357:53.53]I don't know.
[358:04.36]I cannot predict the future.
[358:08.27]I don't have a crystal ball, but streaming at the moment is completely fulfilling.
[358:15.36]And it continues to be, and we'll see how it goes from here.
[358:20.95]I think it'll be good.
[358:26.47]But that's just me being real.
[358:33.26]That's it.
[358:36.02]Uh, thank you to, uh, Liberal Leader for the $10.
[358:39.56]10 bucks from, uh, Liberal Leader.
[358:42.24]They say, good stream.
[358:45.40]Thanks for watching.
[358:46.52]And thanks for the $10.
[358:47.02]Thanks for the 1,000 bids.
[358:52.96]Thank you to Desoid Kaj Podfa for the 10 bucks.
[359:00.27]Thousand bits as well, back to back here.
[359:02.48]Jerma, I just came into your stream.
[359:03.70]Please make it stop.
[359:04.78]I think that was when I was in the rocket chair.
[359:15.23]Thank you, Matt.
[359:17.24]Thank you, Mattis, for the $3.
[359:19.44]Hey, Jerma, TwitchCon is sold out on Saturday.
[359:22.40]Are you going to be there on Sunday?
[359:23.64]I'd really like to meet you.
[359:25.79]I will not be at TwitchCon on Sunday, unfortunately.
[359:30.51]I'm only going to be there for two days.
[359:39.82]Saturday is the day that I'll be mostly on, you know, walking around and doing stuff.
[359:46.24]So I will not be at TwitchCon on Sunday.
[359:57.87]It's also the first time... Where is it?
[359:59.39]Where is it?
[359:59.79]Is it in San Diego?
[360:02.57]TwitchCon, where is it?
[360:08.63]Is it San Diego?
[360:09.13]Yeah.
[360:10.47]I've never been to San Diego, so... That'll be a first time visiting San Diego.
[360:17.19]Jexpo.
[360:20.60]Yeah, if I miss you, I'm sorry, Matt.
[360:24.20]I do plan on being there next time.
[360:27.22]Probably on the same Friday, Saturday, whatever it is.
[360:33.97]But thank you for the three bucks.
[360:34.87]Appreciate it.
[360:36.21]Thank you, ZOMI Games, or ZOMI Games, for the $6.55.
[360:40.31]Did they just say PogChamp?
[360:45.05]Thank you.
[360:46.23]Hopefully I did something cool.
[360:52.53]Thank you, Freudian Weapon, for the $2.50.
[360:55.06]Thanks, Freudian.
[360:58.36]Hi, Germo.
[360:58.76]I haven't been able to tune in for a while.
[361:00.26]I've only seen a small chunk of this game, but the main guy kind of acts how I imagine you would if you were a secret agent.
[361:08.71]It's great.
[361:09.19]Have a good night.
[361:11.47]That game was just ridiculous.
[361:13.63]That's the kind of... I would want to make something that was just not supposed to be taken seriously.
[361:19.41]But was interesting enough that the game had interesting things to do.
[361:23.93]I don't want to make just like a straight up strict meme game.
[361:31.71]Where it...
[361:38.50]Where it just has only like CRAZY FUNNY THINGS!
[361:43.94]Whoa!
[361:44.30]Crazy!
[361:44.90]Whoa!
[361:46.56]You shit his pants and you pooped his pants!
[361:49.12]No.
[361:50.34]I don't want to do that.
[361:52.56]I would try to have some comedy aspects to it, but I think I would want to have it be an actual game.
[362:00.45]But thank you for the $2.50.
[362:02.11]I did like it.
[362:02.67]I thought it was really interesting.
[362:12.27]Hey Wolfstar, thanks for the $4.
[362:13.89]This is the longest time I've ever spent watching a stream.
[362:18.65]Um... About the longest time I ever was on a stream was... Simpsons Hit and Run.
[362:28.74]13 hours, right?
[362:32.68]But thanks for watching for that long.
[362:35.07]Yeah, that's... Thanks.
[362:38.23]I hope you enjoyed it.
[362:43.00]Thank you, Egg Johnson, for the 250.
[362:44.16]Hey, Jerma, when are you gonna give the people what they want and do a chess stream?
[362:49.12]I know how to play chess, but I don't know how to play chess.
[362:55.85]I would never do that.
[363:03.49]Phylactery with the 69 subs.
[363:06.09]Let's show the subs.
[363:10.56]Thank you, everybody.
[363:13.10]for gifting subs, for subbing, for resubbing, for if you're brand new and you just subbed, if you've been here for years and you decided to sub, if you don't sub at all, that's fine too.
[363:26.21]Thanks for being here.
[363:29.63]You guys think I can handle chess after the checkers incidents?
[363:42.76]Thank you, Broluck, for the $5.
[363:44.32]I think this stream has proven you don't know much about cars.
[363:47.50]It's not 1 RPM, it's 1,000 RPM.
[363:49.91]I know, I'm just saying on the dash.
[363:52.69]RPM is revolutions per minute.
[363:54.61]Revolutions of the crankshaft every minute.
[363:57.01]Also, most cars before, like, 2005 have basic... basically zero star rating because of all the new safety features in newer cars, like crumble zones, better airbags, crash avoidance systems, and overall better engineering.
[364:09.60]Get your transmission looked at.
[364:14.13]But are there any one-starred cars now?
[364:22.87]Is a lawnmower a zero safety rated car?
[364:27.33]Right?
[364:28.61]Is a one-star safety rated vehicle a rideable lawnmower?
[364:38.59]It's not a car.
[364:40.44]It's an automobile.
[364:43.45]It's a traveling vehicle with an engine.
[364:47.51]It's not road legal.
[364:55.89]It's not road legal.
[364:57.21]Imagine seeing some fucking dickhead on like the road with a rideable mower.
[365:03.35]It's just out of red light.
[365:08.32]You look out the window, you're like, hey man, what the fuck is wrong with you?
[365:11.50]Yeah, don't worry about it.
[365:12.55]The blades aren't down.
[365:15.01]I'm not, the blades aren't active.
[365:18.19]Those things can fucking move.
[365:20.59]But the blades are not down.
[365:29.88]I've worked in the country.
[365:30.82]People did that.
[365:33.08]That's so fucking dangerous.
[365:43.46]Alright, hold on.
[365:43.92]What about a forklift?
[365:45.84]Is a forklift a five-star safety rated vehicle?
[365:50.29]Its only existence is for safety.
[365:54.15]It has to be.
[365:58.15]A forklift is a safety vehicle, therefore it has to be a five-star rated safety vehicle.
[366:02.89]Otherwise, would you get in one?
[366:08.62]Forklifts don't have doors or airbag, but, uh, what if they did?
[366:11.86]What do you mean a forklift doesn't have an airbag?
[366:14.16]Imagine being in a forklift and just, like, bumping into the wall and a big airbag hits you in the face.
[366:33.85]The airbag would fucking, like, knock you out.
[366:37.63]You're going like eight miles per hour like... You just face first in the airbag.
[366:50.71]Here's a zero star rated car from 2014.
[366:52.55]Wait, what?
[366:59.59]Is this actually real?
[367:04.13]Crash test of the Ford Vigo?
[367:08.47]What is a Ford Figo?
[367:11.34]Ford... what?
[367:19.10]Ford Figo safety rating.
[367:26.53]The Ford Figo facelift has received a three-star safety rating.
[367:33.87]In the new one.
[367:34.56]What about the 2014 one?
[367:38.47]I ain't gonna eat at that restaurant.
[367:45.55]Are you guys like me?
[367:47.49]If it's not McDonald's, Burger King, or Wendy's, if it's less than three stars, you don't go.
[367:53.99]Right?
[367:54.23]I feel like most people... Right?
[367:56.77]I mean, no.
[368:05.36]If it's not, McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Arby's.
[368:09.88]Any of the E's.
[368:14.10]Arby's.
[368:14.78]Wendy's.
[368:16.06]Burger King E's.
[368:18.19]McDonald's E's.
[368:22.81]If it's less than three stars, I ain't gonna go.
[368:26.27]Nobody reviews McDonald's.
[368:29.33]If you leave a two-star rating at a restaurant that's not one of those fast food places, there was a reason why.
[368:37.40]I can't remember the last time that somebody forgot half my fucking order at McDonald's.
[368:41.48]And I was like, let me just go and fucking give them one star.
[368:46.12]No, you go, oh, McDonald's sucks.
[368:48.40]Whatever.
[368:50.80]And you either go back and get it fixed.
[368:53.30]Well, you don't leave a review.
[368:58.96]Oh, shit, my Burger King, my Whopper, it tastes like somebody, and it looks like somebody sat on it.
[369:06.80]It's missing all the things I asked for and the bun looks like it has mold on it.
[369:10.72]Let me get on with yelping.
[369:16.20]No, you just let go of that.
[369:17.06]I'm throwing this in the trash.
[369:18.00]This thing's gross.
[369:20.24]And you move on.
[369:27.90]And also, some people that... Here's another thing.
[369:29.72]This is where it gets kind of weird.
[369:32.29]Some people will review restaurants and they give it a bad rating when maybe they even shouldn't have.
[369:39.77]You know, sometimes it's just somebody who's like, and you know, I'll tell you, I was gonna give this place four stars because the food was great, end quote.
[369:51.68]But let me tell you something about the server, Catherine, okay?
[369:56.82]She came over to my table and she didn't even ask me if I wanted a water refill.
[370:02.91]Place is a one-star restaurant.
[370:08.61]The sugar wasn't repacked on the table.
[370:11.10]I mean, my burrito was absolutely delicious.
[370:14.72]It was probably one of the best burritos in the city.
[370:17.76]But what if I wanted fucking coffee and I wanted to put sugar in my coffee but it wasn't on the table?
[370:22.84]Like, jeez, what the fuck?
[370:32.14]Why is this person putting sugar in their burrito?
[370:36.12]You know, I sat down at this table and I am not kidding.
[370:39.91]I saw a smudge, a big smudge on the table, somebody's thumbprint.
[370:49.99]And it made me gag.
[370:54.41]And me and my nine children left.
[370:59.43]Left.
[371:09.78]Sometimes people do big orders.
[371:12.72]And I, I gotta, you gotta give some credit to the restaurants, right?
[371:16.00]Sometimes, if you go in with, like, ten people, and you, let's say you all order the exact same thing.
[371:23.17]Let's say you all, there's ten of you, you go into the restaurant, you all order the chicken thighs.
[371:31.68]You're all gonna get a slightly different food.
[371:33.66]Slightly.
[371:34.10]Just only slightly.
[371:34.92]Because, like, no two chickens are the same.
[371:37.37]One of them might have a little bit of fat on it.
[371:39.07]One of them, but they're still good.
[371:40.23]You know, they might still be good.
[371:44.23]You can't, everyone can't have the exact same food.
[371:47.58]No matter what.
[371:48.20]The chicken is a different, it's a different chicken possibly.
[371:52.42]What if that chicken was lazy and didn't run around?
[371:56.74]What if that chicken was a little tougher than the other one?
[372:00.08]It's just basic science, guys.
[372:01.40]It's just basic food science.
[372:06.57]And then I take a bite out of my food, and it's the same exact order on the menu.
[372:10.07]It's got the same sauce, same everything.
[372:11.31]It's a little tougher.
[372:12.43]Oh, this is kind of tough today.
[372:14.21]And the person next to me is like, this is fucking absolutely scrumptious.
[372:17.47]Let me try yours.
[372:18.05]Yeah, that is, like, good.
[372:22.99]I'm gonna give it a one star rating because, like, the chicken didn't fucking run around in the coop.
[372:31.40]It's just basic science.
[372:42.98]people that leave yelp reviews on McDonald's you know I was thinking about I I don't know just a random thought just go to like McDonald's just go and like go and that was a good that was it was just a regular decent McDonald's experience and write like an absolutely wonderful review like five stars like as if this place is like 200 a plate talk about the inside I walked in and oh I was wowed by the architecture
[373:15.80]The beautiful crimson red.
[373:21.03]And the mustard yellow.
[373:22.17]It was just the color combination just matched so perfectly well.
[373:25.57]And the chairs were very sturdy and do like a full five paragraph.
[373:34.67]About how amazing the place was.
[373:39.02]The stunning design choice of the ketchup on the table.
[373:41.66]Yeah, just go fucking nuts.
[373:53.77]How do we end up in this topic?
[373:54.85]I don't know.
[373:57.33]I have no, I have no idea.
[373:58.99]Oh, so about cars.
[374:01.21]Right.
[374:01.79]Like two stars for car.
[374:02.89]Yeah.
[374:03.11]Okay.
[374:03.35]That's all.
[374:05.51]Don't say it was a McDonald's until the end of the review.
[374:08.49]Well, it would have to be like on a McDonald's page.
[374:18.98]Ah, you know what?
[374:19.58]This is going to be, it might be, I don't know.
[374:21.04]It's possible that this might be an unpopular opinion.
[374:24.07]I don't think that there should be stars on Yelp.
[374:29.54]I think it should just be have to write a fucking review.
[374:33.46]I mean, that's just me.
[374:41.24]I just like sipped this and there's nothing in it.
[374:42.71]I did like the Kermit the Frog thing.
[374:43.93]Like, well, you know, sip the fucking tea.
[374:46.77]Sip the fucking tea.
[374:48.33]Why am I doing the bubble so often?
[374:49.71]I don't even watch that show.
[375:00.31]But, thank you, BroLuck, for the $5.
[375:03.33]Appreciate it.
[375:04.61]Hey, Kristen, thanks for $30.
[375:05.89]What about Team Fortress 2?
[375:07.45]What about Team Fortress 2?
[375:08.73]It's a great first-person shooter with an awesome array of classes and lots of gameplay choices.
[375:16.21]One of the best first-person shooters I may have ever played.
[375:18.52]It's a great game.
[375:19.50]What about it?
[375:20.44]It's good.
[375:24.94]You should play it.
[375:30.35]I honestly... You know what?
[375:33.17]I may have drained all the vampire-type blood out of that game that I can.
[375:39.25]You know, I've sunk my teeth into TF2 and drained all the blood.
[375:43.05]It's all gone for me.
[375:47.47]Step on it.
[375:47.89]Come on!
[375:49.89]Ah, that wasn't even very good.
[375:54.01]TF2, yelp.
[375:58.64]No, I have no intention of playing it again, really.
[376:04.00]It would take something very, very, very significant for me to ever play that game again.
[376:09.09]I still think it's one of the best games ever made, but, you know.
[376:15.21]I also think pizza is the best, like, food in the world.
[376:17.75]I, like, love pizza.
[376:19.65]I love pepperoni pizza more than anything.
[376:22.33]But sometimes you just don't want to eat pepperoni pizza.
[376:24.68]You want to move on to, like, sushi or something.
[376:26.84]And it becomes your new favorite thing.
[376:34.01]You can't eat pizza every day.
[376:38.20]Don't even give me that Bagel Bites bullshit commercial about pizza in the morning, pizza in the evening, pizza at supper time.
[376:45.18]Pizzas on a bagel are going to be pizza every time.
[376:47.68]No.
[376:48.68]Don't do that.
[376:54.75]Pizza should not be eaten in the morning, in the afternoon, and at the evening every day.
[377:08.24]But, thank you for the $30, 30,000 bits.
[377:11.38]I have no intention of going back to Team Fortress.
[377:14.44]I do love that game, and I do like seeing it pop up when it pops up from time to time.
[377:17.86]You'll see it somewhere.
[377:19.04]Usually, there'll be an image, or there'll be some artwork, or there'll be some meme that uses the characters, and you're like, oh, there they are.
[377:25.63]It's a nice little reminder.
[377:32.25]Modus pones.
[377:33.21]Thanks for the 250.
[377:33.91]There's a repair pal.
[377:35.96]There's a possible shit.
[377:36.96]Oh, this is for the car.
[377:38.30]Possible shift control solenoid fault.
[377:42.12]I'm gonna bookmark that.
[377:48.65]Thanks for the help.
[377:50.37]Actually, like, maybe you just figured it out.
[377:53.41]Pizza is more nutritious than cereal.
[377:55.99]What cereal are you eating?
[378:02.89]Because I would have to tell you that, like, like, Kellogg's Corn Flakes, I'm not sure is less healthy than a slice of pepperoni pizza.
[378:11.02]But what about Total?
[378:22.54]How do people put sugar on their cereal?
[378:24.46]I don't, like, can we go over that too?
[378:28.84]Why do people do that?
[378:33.60]I've seen people have a bowl of cereal and they go in the little sugar bowl and just one, two, three, four, and you spread it on the top and you move it around.
[378:47.16]What would you, don't do that.
[378:51.76]Depends on the cereal.
[378:52.62]No, it's not supposed to be, you're not supposed to put a bunch of sugar on your total bran flakes.
[378:58.82]That's you breaking the design philosophy of the developer.
[379:03.63]The dev didn't want you to go through that door and you broke it and you went in anyways and you glitched through the wall.
[379:09.97]And you saw all the items that are in the fucking game in the dev room breaking.
[379:17.12]And now you fucked it all up and you soil it for yourself.
[379:20.66]I don't even put sugar in my coffee anymore.
[379:33.38]Did you guys know that you're only supposed to have 35 or 38 grams of added sugar a day?
[379:41.22]Did you guys know that?
[379:41.88]Did you guys know this?
[379:48.73]If you drink one soda, if you drink one Coca-Cola Classic out of the can, your entire day of added sugar is over.
[379:58.99]And then you are now over.
[380:03.02]What the heck is going on here?
[380:06.86]They're sweetening us to death.
[380:08.74]Is what they're doing.
[380:23.87]I have this... This powder.
[380:26.91]It's like a little, uh... It's like a... Flavored like vanilla powder, right?
[380:33.21]You can put it in your coffee, you can add it to pretty much whatever you want.
[380:36.73]On the back of this thing, it's... Oh, here's the serving size.
[380:41.75]A third of a cup of this sugar powder is one serving.
[380:49.83]A third of a cup of this dusty vanilla sugar fucking bullshit is one serving.
[381:03.19]Shit's almost 40 grams of sugar.
[381:05.31]Why would you put that much in there?
[381:10.08]Are you okay calm- I can't calm down!
[381:11.70]We're talking about the health of- of- We're talking about our health!
[381:16.88]I'm talking about your health!
[381:21.86]Did you know that- Did you know that if you cut the amount of sugar in half that you put into your coffee,
[381:34.01]wouldn't know the difference in a blind taste test did you know how can you cut zero in half good good job
[381:56.44]I think it's the soda companies.
[381:58.82]The soda companies just want you to be all popped up on sugar.
[382:03.31]You know, that's...
[382:32.99]I mean, honestly, it would be... If I would drink two or three of them a day, if it were me and it was up to me, I would have like three, four, five sodas a day.
[382:42.72]Every day.
[382:43.52]In fact, like before bed, too.
[382:48.19]Something about that is just really very interesting to me, to do that.
[382:55.61]And I don't go to the dentist anymore, either.
[383:08.22]Hey, thank you!
[383:09.36]Quarter a dime for the three dollars.
[383:10.94]Appreciate it.
[383:13.45]Jeremiah, of all the games you would stream for over 13 hours, it had to be that one.
[383:17.21]The moment I saw it in the feed, I committed myself and over the course of three days watched the entire thing.
[383:24.76]I was waiting for it and will remember it fondly.
[383:35.72]That was... I went from really happy and thinking things were funny and fun, to being so angry, to wanting to just turn the game off, to just accepting everything that was like happening on the screen.
[383:54.35]To madness.
[383:55.47]That I went over every, every single possible emotion was in that 13 hours.
[384:07.07]I felt every single emotion.
[384:10.47]Happiness.
[384:11.21]Fear.
[384:13.35]Anger.
[384:14.21]Sadness.
[384:21.04]Distraught.
[384:22.82]Anxious.
[384:25.92]Greed.
[384:27.50]Gluttony.
[384:29.65]Every emotion.
[384:33.31]Wrath.
[384:40.92]Yeah, these are the sins.
[384:42.58]Never mind.
[384:45.32]It was wild, though.
[384:47.84]But thank you, quarterdime.
[384:48.64]Appreciate it.
[384:50.20]Thank you also to Broluck for the five dollars.
[384:54.24]Thank you, Broluck.
[384:54.86]And they say... This is, uh... What you said is real.
[385:02.95]What's real?
[385:07.57]Oh, this is riding lawnmowers.
[385:11.54]It's lawnmower races?
[385:19.64]Are they?
[385:20.26]These aren't road tested, though.
[385:21.84]Hold on.
[385:29.35]That's not a lawnmower, though.
[385:43.45]Hold on.
[385:45.19]Yeah, this is not a lawnmower.
[385:56.16]Where'd they go?
[385:59.28]That's it.
[386:00.00]Alright.
[386:00.32]Is it?
[386:05.99]Oh, I feel bad for the person all the way in the back left there.
[386:08.49]That is like a little rinky-dink one.
[386:10.89]Why is the guy in the front here allowed to compete?
[386:12.67]There's like different weight classes.
[386:15.79]You can't have like a featherweight versus a super heavyweight.
[386:28.42]How fast is it gonna go?
[386:38.42]Holy shit.
[386:40.97]That's not a lawnmower.
[386:49.45]That goes faster than my car.
[386:55.27]Oh my god.
[386:59.00]Something, something and the blades are up.
[387:07.75]Thank you, Prologue.
[387:09.97]For the $5 NFT.
[387:12.27]Hey, Wolfstar, thanks for $5.
[387:13.65]I watched stream from beginning to end.

[387:18.49]Definitely watching live again.
[387:21.03]Thank you.
[387:22.03]For some reason, I thought you were going to say definitely not watching live again.
[387:25.55]I don't know why.
[387:26.13]I just felt it was going to happen.
[387:29.12]But hey, come on back.
[387:31.50]We'll be here.
[387:37.66]Thank you to Quarterdime for the $3 to round us out here.

[392:08.97]When's the last time you, like, cleaned out your fucking C drive?
[392:11.09]Do it.
[392:11.57]Do it tonight.
[392:12.21]Do it tonight.
[392:12.57]Run a scan to make sure you're good.
[392:15.73]Nobody ever tells you to do that.
[392:25.33]Did you get... Yeah, I know.
[392:27.34]I'm just saying.
[392:29.10]Just, like, keep up to date on your, like, computer and take care of it.
[392:35.91]I just did.
[392:36.43]I got 1482 threats.
[392:38.47]Okay, well I'm guaranteeing that you are over the age of 65.
[392:43.25]You know how you can tell?
[392:52.71]You want a magic trick you guys can do?
[392:56.19]Or like, here's just a complete magic trick in general.
[393:00.94]You could tell the age of somebody just by how many viruses they have on their computer.
[393:08.13]Like, all I need is a name.
[393:10.58]All I need is a, okay.
[393:12.34]Just look up what the last five websites were in their history.
[393:16.88]You can do one of those cold reading, like, okay, so, well, what was her name?
[393:25.49]And how old was she?
[393:26.71]You can really do that.
[393:29.07]Just scan the computer for viruses.
[393:30.39]If there's more than 500 viruses, that person is over the age of 65 years old.
[393:34.90]I'm getting the fact that they're older, they're wiser, but not quite old.
[393:45.74]The last five tabs, the last five, the history.
[393:50.92]Walmart.com.
[393:57.25]And it's bookmarked as Amazon.
[394:01.01]Oh, I'm getting some... I'm getting some new... Shopper.
