[00:20.26]You weren't supposed to be able to see me yet.
[00:23.00]I'm not supposed to be on here.
[00:28.77]But hi.
[00:31.97]He thinks he's live.
[00:37.11]Don't turn it off.
[00:38.41]No, I'm fucking out of here.
[00:40.53]Just, like, listen to, like, the bibbidi-bip-bip-bibbidi-bip-bip.
[00:43.22]Be right back.
[01:13.67]Okay.
[01:15.01]That means your mic is hot now.
[01:19.27]Okay.
[01:21.00]My first time.
[01:24.70]Hey everybody, welcome to the stream!
[01:27.42]You know me.
[01:28.24]Look at your wrist to view your watch.
[01:29.76]Don't listen to that lady, she's gonna say that over and over again.
[01:34.43]You can hear me, right?
[01:36.93]Oh yeah.
[01:38.43]Alright, good.
[01:41.15]Today we're going to play some fun co-op VR games, me and my friend Star here.
[01:45.77]Something you might have heard of once.
[01:50.58]Very fun games.
[01:51.88]We picked the most exciting VR games that have ever been made.
[01:55.72]Yeah, last week we played, what was it, Lethal League Blitz?
[01:59.60]Last week, so we decided to come together.
[02:01.36]Actually, that was only like three days ago.
[02:03.68]Something like that.
[02:05.10]I got the wrong hands on.
[02:08.27]So we don't know how to do any of this.
[02:11.02]We've been sitting here for a little while trying to figure out... You say VR stream, but you mean like tech stream.
[02:18.41]We've never played VR.
[02:19.35]I've never done any VR multiplayer.
[02:21.75]And it was just like, let's do it.
[02:22.81]And we both sat down for a while.
[02:24.63]We picked out some games to do.
[02:26.80]And then we sat down to actually try to do that.
[02:28.91]We have no idea what to do.
[02:30.87]So.
[02:32.29]So far, I'm pretty good at buying VR games.
[02:34.87]Yeah, I'm really good at, like, purchasing games on Steam at this point.
[02:37.77]Look at your wrist to view your watch.
[02:39.31]That went well.
[02:40.47]All right, are you going in?
[02:42.96]I'm in the tutorial room.
[02:44.40]Yeah, me too.
[02:45.16]But are you, like, going in?
[02:46.18]Are you in?
[02:47.70]Oh, I'm in.
[02:48.60]Okay, I need clarification that you're in, so I can go in too, so then I can be in here.
[02:54.85]Look at your wrist to view your watch.
[02:59.08]Like, my balls are dangling right now, you're gonna have to tell me.
[03:01.86]I'm in!
[03:02.58]Get in!
[03:02.98]INJECT!
[03:03.74]Alright, that's all I needed to hear, man.
[03:09.68]Alright, uh, this thing's- oh, this is too tight.
[03:12.16]Look at your wrist to do your work.
[03:13.50]Hold on, wait, technical difficulties.
[03:17.08]Okay.
[03:18.82]It's too big.
[03:19.28]Alright.
[03:21.42]Are you in?
[03:23.40]I'm in- oh, I'm in.
[03:25.24]I think I just pulled out all the hair in the front of my head.
[03:29.50]Look at your wrist to view your watch.
[03:30.96]I'm gonna look at my wrist.
[03:32.20]Just relax.
[03:34.94]Are you seriously not looking at your wrist right now?
[03:36.86]Hold on.
[03:37.86]I thought you were in.
[03:38.64]I'm in now.
[03:41.94]Okay, there you guys are.
[03:43.28]Hi, guys.
[03:44.94]Look at your wrist.
[03:45.54]I did.
[03:46.28]Alright, here's my wrist.
[03:47.32]Let's get you into a game.
[03:48.47]Alright, let's get into a game.
[03:49.53]Press the play button on your watch.
[03:51.77]My fucking headphones just came out.
[03:53.63]I'm stopping these in as deep as I can.
[03:54.97]I don't even know if this is the right one.
[04:01.24]I did buy, like, the VR, like, fucking caulking glue that you just stuff it in your ear and it's a headphone.
[04:10.04]And you need to get, like, a goddamn surgeon to get it out.
[04:12.20]Alright, let's, uh, how do I join your video game?
[04:18.12]Go to play?
[04:20.62]Look at your watch.
[04:21.55]Alright, there's paintball, paddleball, paintball, crimson cauldron, laser tag, golden trophy...
[04:31.67]How do I, like, be your friend?
[04:34.11]Well, look at your watch!
[04:35.55]I am in my watch!
[04:36.67]Where are you?
[04:37.05]You look at your watch and it says people, and I imagine you're people.
[04:40.24]People?
[04:41.72]Oh, it's like forcing us to press the play button.
[04:44.86]Where do you see people?
[04:47.04]Right below... Okay, hold on.
[04:53.97]Go back to the home menu.
[04:57.26]It's making me pick Paddle Ball.
[04:58.96]It's making me pick Paddle Ball too.
[05:00.32]Is this like putting us in the game together?
[05:02.43]Let's pick Paddle Ball.
[05:03.81]Just pick Paddle Ball.
[05:05.15]Easily.
[05:05.41]We're the only people queuing Rec Room Paddle Ball tutorial mode right now.
[05:10.08]You'll be matched with another player.
[05:11.60]It's you!
[05:12.04]We didn't have to... Hey!
[05:13.51]Look over here!
[05:14.07]Is it your name is TastyOctopus?
[05:16.01]And you're coming through twice.
[05:16.89]Nice.
[05:17.07]How do I delete that?
[05:17.93]As you can imagine, the game is not working.
[05:21.03]Voices.
[05:21.21]Voices, turn that off.
[05:22.21]My microphone.
[05:23.45]Turn your microphone off.
[05:24.63]In the settings.
[05:25.23]Where?
[05:39.56]Open up your fucking, like, Aqua Teen watch.
[05:42.66]I'm in the watch.
[05:44.12]Why can I still hear you?
[05:46.12]Where do I turn it off?
[05:47.24]Go into your watch, go to settings, and then turn up my microphone, turn it off.
[05:55.23]It's off.
[05:55.99]Why are you huge?
[05:58.81]This is how tall I am.
[05:59.97]You're not like 6'8".
[06:01.11]What?
[06:01.37]It maps the VR to where your head is.
[06:04.67]No, no, that's ridiculous.
[06:06.17]Give me a high five.
[06:06.87]That was a good one right there, man.
[06:09.17]Oh, yeah, okay.
[06:11.41]He's fucking huge, man.
[06:14.35]What the fuck are you doing?
[06:16.06]Why would you do that?
[06:18.20]What?
[06:18.48]I just wanted to play rock, paper, scissors.
[06:20.02]You ready?
[06:21.44]What the fuck is wrong with him?
[06:22.94]We haven't even been here for five minutes.
[06:24.96]Rock, paper, scissors.
[06:26.46]How do you do the thumb?
[06:30.52]How do you do the thumb?
[06:33.76]Whoa!
[06:35.10]What?
[06:35.72]I just teleported.
[06:36.52]How do you do the thumb?
[06:37.62]How do you do the thumb?
[06:40.01]Um... It's different on Vive controllers, I don't know.
[06:45.33]Do I... Why do you have, like, the better... What, you have, like, a better VR system than me?
[06:51.06]No, I'm just taller.
[06:54.48]That's bullshit.
[06:55.08]You have... I know what's going on here.
[06:56.64]This is exactly what's fucking happening.
[06:58.32]You have your...
[06:59.90]Your Oculus, by the way.
[07:02.17]Oculus is like the platform you shouldn't be on.
[07:04.35]You should be on the HTC Vive, just in case you were wondering.
[07:07.15]You have... Wait.
[07:09.19]Are you just sad?
[07:10.91]It gives you random faces.
[07:14.45]Oh, I thought you were like crying or something.
[07:17.78]Your character is just doing like a constant, I'm talking, listen to me, I'm important.
[07:23.78]Wait, can I get down here to your size?
[07:25.20]No, that's bullshit.
[07:26.52]You have your two lighthouses on huge, like, cranes.
[07:31.19]I'm honestly sitting on the ground.
[07:34.29]Yeah, it's because I have my setup correct, and your setup is fucked up.
[07:38.93]You're not this tall.
[07:40.47]You're not, like, ten feet tall.
[07:42.37]Give me a hug.
[07:43.75]You're like Andre the Giant.
[07:45.93]All right, let's go.
[07:47.47]Majestic Squirrel versus Hasty Octopus.
[07:50.80]Which one, which one's you?
[07:53.04]I'm Majestic Squirrel.
[07:54.64]You are so big!
[07:56.51]This is not, I can't do it like this!
[07:59.35]Can you move your lighthouses down, like, five feet?
[08:02.51]How do you play?
[08:05.41]Wait, what, why did that just pop up?
[08:08.11]How do I, like, turn this off?
[08:10.05]I don't, what?
[08:10.75]Hey, just in case, one of my mods is playing TF2, in case you were curious.
[08:15.30]Alright, so, we got... Oh, I think, I don't know the rules.
[08:18.42]It's just, it's like, uh, just big, it's small tennis.
[08:21.57]Well, tennis.
[08:22.37]Yeah.
[08:24.77]I can't get over how fucking huge you are.
[08:26.52]That's not... Alright, I wasn't... Why is there no sound?
[08:32.64]It's coming over here.
[08:33.84]I need, like, a bit more audio.
[08:38.56]It's, like, just music.
[08:40.40]Go!
[08:42.34]Alright.
[08:42.70]Alright, how do I turn...
[08:48.93]I don't have sound, it's just music.
[08:50.99]What the fuck?
[08:51.73]See, it's... Did you just score off me right now?
[08:55.29]I don't know.
[08:55.89]Fucking ten foot tall.
[09:03.09]Fucking Jolly Green Giant over here.
[09:05.01]Oh my god.
[09:13.96]This game... Hold on.
[09:15.10]Wait, wait, wait.
[09:15.78]How do I turn up?
[09:16.56]How do I make the sounds better?
[09:19.04]Can you just win so we can get out of the tutorial?
[09:22.14]Uh, sure.
[09:22.79]So we can just play Jeopardy for God's sake.
[09:24.37]Go!
[09:28.65]I'm gonna hit this as hard as I fucking can.
[09:30.21]Hope you're ready for that.
[09:31.77]Can I, like, grab it first?
[09:35.31]Where am I in my room?
[09:36.85]Am I near, like, a wall?
[09:41.62]Which wall is back here?
[09:46.66]You're okay?
[09:47.18]Alright.
[09:48.46]Let's go.
[09:59.95]Match point.
[10:01.65]This is too hard.
[10:02.83]I hit that.
[10:03.93]It's too hard.
[10:05.79]Alright, can we say congratulations?
[10:10.13]We did it.
[10:10.75]I got a present?
[10:11.45]What is it?
[10:12.51]Open!
[10:12.89]You got an exclamation point.
[10:14.13]Good for you.
[10:15.04]I got another one?
[10:16.20]That's pretty satisfying.
[10:16.96]That's kind of satisfying.
[10:30.02]50 tokens?
[10:32.62]What did you get?
[10:33.08]I got 50 tokens.
[10:39.10]How do I do the thumbs up?
[10:44.05]Violet, why are you dressed like an opera singer?
[10:46.73]What?
[10:48.85]You got a tank top on.
[10:50.39]Yeah, I do.
[10:51.17]Yeah, I do.
[10:55.27]How do I leave?
[10:57.62]I think we're stuck here opening boxes for another hour.
[10:59.92]Are we?
[11:00.48]There's a door right there.
[11:02.38]Should we leave?
[11:04.00]Oh, you have walking on.
[11:06.49]You're advanced.
[11:08.33]Yeah, I'm going to throw up.
[11:09.39]By the way, this makes me throw up.
[11:21.20]How do we leave?
[11:21.92]Oh, stop button on the... No, I don't want to do that again.
[11:25.88]Does our watch have a thing?
[11:28.32]Oh, there we go.
[11:34.23]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11:34.87]Okay, challenges.
[11:35.67]It wants us to do a challenge now.
[11:38.49]Wait, what about this room?
[11:42.03]Is this a store?
[11:44.03]Wait, let me turn this... I need to turn the music down.
[11:46.52]The sounds are going to go up.
[11:47.98]Oh.
[11:50.64]What happened?
[11:51.12]What are you doing?
[11:51.82]I sent you a friend request.
[11:54.08]You sent me a package.
[11:56.50]Oh.
[11:57.74]That's my package.
[11:58.97]That's my box because I completed the challenge to make friends with you.
[12:03.45]No one else could do it.
[12:11.01]Oh look, I got another one.
[12:12.31]Complete one game in paddle ball daily.
[12:16.07]Will you stop spraying the coins on me?
[12:20.63]All right, who gives a shit?
[12:21.69]Press the start button on the scoreboard to play.
[12:25.33]I want, I, let's go, okay, okay, play.
[12:29.30]All right, all right, all right, can we pick something, the same thing?
[12:31.26]Let's play like bowling or something.
[12:37.25]This is just Roblox.
[12:39.13]Did you, yeah, did you accept my friend request?
[12:41.33]I don't know, did I?
[12:43.31]People?
[12:44.68]I have a message from you.
[12:47.44]It's open.
[12:48.08]That's from me.
[12:49.32]It's next to you.
[12:49.88]I accept your friend request.
[12:51.26]Okay, we're friends now.
[12:53.52]Yay.
[12:53.82]Alright, play.
[12:59.30]Are we just going to jump into one of these?
[13:03.20]How about The Streets?
[13:05.82]Okay, I just clicked on something called The Streets.
[13:07.54]I don't know what this is.
[13:09.02]You're gone.
[13:10.66]Click on The Streets.
[13:13.05]It's like the second page.
[13:14.43]Okay, why is this all screwed up?
[13:18.86]Oh, shit.
[13:22.70]This is like a fucking PvP room.
[13:27.24]We're going to be throwing up on the streets.
[13:32.74]How do I... See, look at how fucking huge you are.
[13:35.25]You are way too big.
[13:37.15]Everybody else is normal.
[13:40.73]This person can hear me talking, right?
[13:43.41]Did you mute your mic?
[13:45.19]I'm like, why am I spying on what she's writing?
[13:47.99]That was so odd.
[13:48.85]Okay, I have a new notification.
[13:50.13]What?
[13:53.49]Who?
[13:53.97]Are we kicking me out?
[13:55.03]No.
[13:56.13]I don't... Everybody has boxes and shit.
[14:01.91]Alright, let's just go to the PvP area.
[14:04.05]I don't know what this does.
[14:09.44]I'm going out.
[14:10.06]Are you coming?
[14:15.48]What?
[14:15.68]There's people shooting lasers at me.
[14:17.22]I got a shovel.
[14:22.06]I got a... We killed each other.
[14:24.52]I'm alive.
[14:28.02]Power weapon refreshed.
[14:29.24]This is Roblox.
[14:32.21]That guy has a sword and a shield.
[14:33.47]I like handball better.
[14:46.99]What's with gamers and being so violent?
[14:49.00]Oh, I just heard a scream.
[14:50.38]So I got killed.
[14:56.91]Where are the weapons?
[15:14.47]I think that kid might actually be running around in his house.
[15:20.45]It's a big house.
[15:21.31]All right, good guy.
[15:21.83]Come in.
[15:22.07]Come in.
[15:22.57]Come in here.
[15:24.99]Walk and unlock the door.
[15:26.09]I'm not going to shoot him.
[15:29.73]I'm not going to shoot him.
[15:31.33]I'm absolutely lost.
[15:34.43]You want to kill me, I'll kill you.
[15:36.83]Understand?
[15:39.07]Should I not have done that?
[15:40.71]Hey, come into the door.
[15:41.55]There's a door over here.
[15:43.59]Do you see the door in the building?
[15:45.75]There's like buildings everywhere!
[15:47.03]I know, but there's a locked door.
[15:49.63]I can't even communicate because you're in the head.
[15:52.15]Um... I always die!
[15:59.30]Come on!
[16:00.02]Am I a prisoner right now?
[16:02.48]I- I'm supposed to become a prisoner in here.
[16:08.94]You have to help me.
[16:10.90]They're absolutely ruthless in here.
[16:13.08]What color is the house?
[16:14.50]Uh, it's blue on the inside.
[16:15.58]I don't know what it looks like on the outside.
[16:19.74]They're fucking torturing me in here.
[16:21.87]Let me ask you a thing.
[16:23.05]Oh, why would you go here, Caillou?
[16:27.47]Dude, don't be a threat.
[16:33.07]Is that you opening the door?
[16:34.37]Yeah, I don't own this PlayStation 3 now.
[16:37.69]It's my friend's, but I'm playing on his VR, so...
[16:44.34]They haven't even turned around to look.
[16:49.01]At what point is he going to turn around and be like, what are you doing, man?
[16:56.99]I need to hold on a second.
[17:02.74]Whoa, what?
[17:03.02]Hey, he saw me go off my watch.
[17:05.42]He saw me go off my watch and he fucking shot me.
[17:18.39]Where are you?
[17:20.23]I just got to the blue house.
[17:22.19]No, no, no.
[17:22.57]It's Tony's gun store.
[17:24.09]Tony's gun store.
[17:24.75]You went to the wrong place.
[17:28.92]Tony's going to Tony's gun store.
[17:32.94]How have I not been hit?
[17:34.80]He's back.
[17:35.62]He's back.
[17:36.10]Are you at Tony's gun shop yet?
[17:41.79]I'm stuck inside the blue house.
[18:06.43]Hey, let me in.
[18:06.85]Let me in.
[18:07.29]Let me in, man.
[18:07.85]Let me in.
[18:08.65]Let me in.
[18:10.93]Hey, let me in, man.
[18:14.81]Let me in.
[18:15.15]There's wild people here shooting at me, man.
[18:17.07]Let me in.
[18:17.85]Oh, thank God I made it in.
[18:19.93]People out there shooting at us.
[18:20.99]What the heck?
[18:37.84]I don't wanna, I'm just, I'm gonna, I'm your, I'm a prisoner.
[18:42.25]I don't have any weapons, I can't shoot you.

[23:26.55]Can we play pool too?
[23:27.39]Wow, you are really short.
[23:29.53]No, have you just noticed that you're a monster in every single lobby?
[23:33.01]You're just a gigantic person.
[23:36.90]I wouldn't be surprised if you... You're like, whoa, he's gonna start a VR fight.
[23:44.56]We got that coming up later.
[23:46.30]Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you something.
[23:47.62]You want to stick around because we got a fun fighting game.
[23:50.24]What did I just do?
[23:53.23]Whose turn is it?
[23:54.85]Um... I'm not that... You're really just making this so hard for me.
[24:03.69]Me?
[24:04.48]Why couldn't you have known that you were going to be on my live stream?
[24:06.80]You could have brought your lighthouses down two feet.
[24:08.98]I don't know what that means.
[24:13.63]How do you pick up a ball?
[24:19.45]Do you have a ball?
[24:20.81]No, I... I don't know.
[24:23.68]I have no idea.
[24:25.30]How does anyone figure out this game?
[24:27.70]Okay, literal children are playing this right now.
[24:30.34]You understand?
[24:31.20]We're adults.
[24:31.76]We have to figure this out.
[24:34.32]But first, I'm going to get a drink.
[24:35.24]Ball, there's a bowling shirt.
[24:38.95]Hold on.
[24:39.73]What is this?
[24:40.73]Coffee or something?
[24:43.34]Free donuts.
[24:48.88]Yay.
[24:51.36]What does that mean?
[24:52.70]Oh, you want a slice?
[24:53.93]There's a wall there.
[24:57.07]He's like looking in the instructional manual.
[25:00.51]Hmm, how do we play the game?
[25:02.69]It says practice.
[25:03.59]It says game in progress, but it says practice.
[25:09.84]How do I get to turn this off?
[25:12.11]How do I, like, disable notifications?
[25:18.59]Personal space.
[25:19.77]Ignore bubble.
[25:24.60]Okay, that's good.
[25:25.14]All right.
[25:26.54]Did you figure it out?
[25:28.28]I mean, it should be my turn.
[25:29.72]There's just no balls.
[25:30.76]All right, guys, what are we doing wrong?
[25:39.18]What are we doing wrong?
[25:43.10]I think we're playing Rec Room.
[25:45.28]Well, let's see.
[25:45.84]Maybe somebody says, no clue.
[25:47.15]We need balls.
[25:49.77]We need to do an official game mode.
[25:54.51]Just run down and kick the pins.
[25:57.05]But you can't.
[25:58.05]I tried.
[26:01.85]Did you, like, press a button over here?
[26:04.99]We both had to press start.
[26:07.47]I pressed start.
[26:09.33]That's it.
[26:14.48]You're the host.
[26:22.97]There's two old fucks lost in a kid's game.
[26:27.29]Oh, you lost.
[26:30.33]Who won?
[26:30.77]I found out how to end the game.
[26:32.15]Okay.
[26:33.39]This is... FFA Sandbox.
[26:35.85]That's the problem that we're having here.
[26:39.18]We don't want to do Sandbox.
[26:40.42]Two team...
[26:42.95]Just you versus me.
[26:44.55]Not free-for-all sandbox.
[26:45.81]Me, two teams.
[26:48.13]Two-team sandbox.
[26:49.41]Me versus you.
[26:50.71]Game starts in three seconds.

[26:52.75]Game on.
[26:53.65]Game on.
[26:56.63]Alright, who's up first?
[26:58.31]Me.
[26:58.89]Like... Dude, I bet this is like you need to buy the ball and have it in your inventory.
[27:10.31]You definitely don't have to buy the ball.
[27:12.63]No, you have to buy the ball.
[27:16.13]The balls are in the front?
[27:31.28]Balls in the front?
[27:33.93]Like in the lockers?
[27:40.92]uh somebody said undertale front undertale font we're not in hey we're not in the we're not in the bowling game mode we're in the bowling room what's the difference I don't know I guess this is like not the bowling game this is like the hang out with your friends or the bowling alley I'm gonna go somewhere different take us somewhere

[28:11.63]We'll just go on our bare feet.
[28:13.91]We'll be fine.
[28:14.42]Dude, you're right.
[28:24.06]Wait, wait, wait!
[28:24.74]Don't do anything yet!
[28:25.54]Stop it!
[28:25.86]Is that activated?

[28:34.17]Just get us the fuck out of here.
[28:39.94]Like walk through here to activate.

[28:46.54]Can I see what you're doing?
[28:53.87]No.
[28:57.21]I don't know what's going to make these any different.
[29:00.09]We're just going to be in a room.
[29:07.76]To create a private room, open your watch and press on play.
[29:10.52]Then find the room you want to create a private version of.
[29:13.24]Afterwards, instead of clicking the icon, click the exclamation button.
[29:17.00]Close the... I missed it.
[29:24.37]It looks like an old motherfucker on an iPad.
[29:27.65]That's what my grandfather does when he's on his iPhone.
[29:32.31]Like, oh, Richard, I'm gonna send a text.
[29:34.63]And...
[29:37.05]We good?
[29:38.25]Where we going?
[29:38.69]No.
[29:38.77]Alright, hold on.
[29:42.03]Click the... Close the name of the room, then press on private.
[29:47.07]And voila.
[29:48.02]You now have a private room.
[29:49.38]I'm close.
[29:50.20]I'm getting close.
[29:57.84]Somebody just said I'm the most obnoxious streamer on Twitch.
[30:01.07]It's... That's not true.
[30:06.12]Why?
[30:06.60]What did I do?
[30:16.06]You couldn't figure out how to play bowling.
[30:19.58]Well, it's alright.
[30:20.46]Dude, I'm following the instructions and they're... Let me see what happens when I... Let me think of it a try.
[30:26.33]I'm a little younger than you, so... Yeah.
[30:29.29]Okay, let's see here.
[30:30.15]You're not, but...
[30:41.32]I got it.
[30:41.66]Me and you.
[30:42.04]Dodgeball.
[30:42.46]Let's go.
[30:42.88]For real.
[30:43.18]I'm going to invite you.
[30:45.97]I figured it out in 10 seconds.
[30:47.63]Oh my god.
[30:49.53]If you like, you can practice until more players arrive.
[30:52.79]Waiting for the invite.
[30:58.51]Come on in.
[31:06.56]We kind of already did this, but with a paddle.
[31:11.31]We're on different teams, right?
[31:13.02]Ready to start.
[31:14.04]Why did you just do that?
[31:15.84]You and I are on the same side of the court.
[31:18.30]What color is your shirt?
[31:20.84]I can't see my own shirt.
[31:22.22]You're blue.
[31:22.74]Game on.
[31:25.00]Here we go.
[31:25.30]You ready?
[31:29.12]Dodgeball.
[31:32.04]Put it away.
[31:39.92]I punched him by... Alright, I'm go... Can I get that one?
[31:52.35]No.
[31:56.81]You don't have legs, so it went through you.
[32:00.45]We don't have any more balls.
[32:05.19]Okay.
[32:06.17]Here it comes.
[32:06.59]You ready?
[32:06.87]I'm gonna fucking hit something.
[32:12.83]How did these go slower than the paddle ball got paddled?
[32:16.01]I don't know, but how can we not do this?
[32:18.56]Why are we so awful at this?
[32:26.22]There was no way you could hit me!
[32:27.54]I was doing the move!
[32:30.51]You were doing the doggy paddle.
[32:33.13]See, like, I need to help you.
[32:35.15]It's no fear, you can teleport.
[32:37.61]That's the BS.
[32:38.25]Like that block?
[32:38.91]Give me that.
[32:49.34]All right, now you're fucked, ready?
[32:59.05]Can you not catch?
[33:05.41]Here, here, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[33:07.49]If I was 11, this would be the most fun I've ever had.
[33:09.67]Wait.
[33:11.95]I said wait!
[33:13.05]I'm gonna toss it up gently and try and catch it.
[33:16.57]Okay.
[33:20.97]I didn't know that was real.
[33:21.91]Okay, you can catch it.
[33:25.91]Ooh, look at that.
[33:27.99]Ooh, what do you know?
[33:28.73]Spin it around a little bit.
[33:34.92]Ow!
[33:38.76]Fuck!
[33:42.10]It's so loud.
[33:44.50]It shouldn't be.
[33:58.06]Come on!
[33:58.34]Why would I do that?
[34:07.95]I don't... Hey!
[34:08.81]Out!
[34:12.21]Other than that.
[34:15.43]Alright.
[34:16.19]Are you sick of the worst game of dodgeball you've ever played?
[34:19.65]It's getting a little hot in here.
[34:21.95]Can you hit yourself in the face?
[34:37.32]Oh, fuck.
[34:39.45]How many times have you ran into your desk?
[34:43.01]Not once.
[34:45.57]Hit.
[34:48.21]Next.
[34:50.03]Game over.
[34:51.79]Tell me to check.
[34:52.37]Let's get one more.
[34:53.17]Blue team wins.
[34:55.17]Next.
[34:55.65]We didn't spend no money to not get out of here in 15 seconds.
[35:00.35]I mean, different game.
[35:01.59]Like, not dodgeball.
[35:05.11]Okay.
[35:06.11]How about
[35:08.97]Never have I ever.
[35:10.70]Rec room restaurant.
[35:11.74]Rec restaurant.
[35:12.40]That's what we're doing.
[35:13.12]Shit!
[35:13.48]I didn't... I went to the public one.
[35:15.82]It's just gonna be a hangout.
[35:21.36]I gotta move this.
[35:26.82]I went to a public restaurant.
[35:30.86]Big mistake.
[35:32.30]Do you see... People...
[35:39.12]People actually fucking hanging out in here.
[35:41.53]Like, pretending to be in a cafeteria.
[36:01.70]Come over here.
[36:04.77]Hold on, put your mic on.
[36:06.37]It's going to sound terrible, but we need to...
[36:12.46]So this is the place I was talking about.
[36:16.05]They got pretty good burgers here.
[36:18.03]They got an excellent, excellent garlic aioli that goes on top of it, too.
[36:21.33]It's pretty great.
[36:23.57]Did you use Open Table to get us a reservation here?
[36:28.09]No.
[36:29.23]OK.
[36:31.47]OK.
[36:31.93]Let's go ahead and just, uh.
[36:32.85]That's a snowman.
[36:33.71]Excuse me, does anybody work here?
[36:43.89]Oh, hey, you should be his new boss.
[36:45.99]He has lots of restaurant experience, this guy.
[36:49.25]He runs Michelin-star restaurants.
[36:52.15]Oh, that's great, because this place is in a state of disrepair.
[36:54.61]It's complete chaos here.
[36:55.83]Wait, who needs menus?
[36:58.98]Oh, okay, let me see.
[37:00.06]Is this... No, that's okay.
[37:01.74]I know it's your first day.
[37:03.06]I believe they do.
[37:04.06]They need the menus.
[37:05.86]Oh, wait, do you work here?
[37:07.22]Okay.
[37:08.74]Burger minus steak equals pizza.
[37:16.53]Go break through the window?
[37:17.97]Okay.
[37:18.25]Uh, I think, um, could I just get a glass of water?
[37:20.13]Can I just get a glass of water?
[37:23.49]No, that's okay.
[37:26.65]That's okay.
[37:27.35]Um...
[37:40.73]Everything okay back here?
[37:42.40]Can you pick a table?
[37:43.82]Because you're blocking the way.
[37:45.98]I can't get through you.
[37:48.24]We need to get seated.
[37:49.80]What do you want?
[37:51.52]That's the VIP table.
[37:52.70]What do you want, sir?
[37:54.08]Thank you so much.
[37:55.00]I'm going to do any of the other tables you see here.
[37:57.06]Right, guys, what do you want?
[38:02.13]So I heard about this place on Yelp.
[38:04.95]I come to New City, and I try to go to Yelp, and I go to the top ten on Yelp.
[38:09.79]And this was number two, so we're really hoping for big things here.
[38:16.32]So I guess, you ready to order?
[38:17.96]Because I looked at the extensive menu that you guys have.
[38:21.80]There's a candle, though.
[38:25.13]I think I will have... I think I'm going to have the hamburger here.
[38:31.41]Can I get that medium, please?
[38:33.92]Sorry, what?
[38:34.94]Oh, it's okay.
[38:35.76]It's all right.
[38:37.56]It's okay.
[38:48.78]I'm not supposed to be doing this at three and a half on Yelp so far.
[38:52.14]That is one short streamer.
[38:53.06]Who said that?
[39:17.34]Do you know what you're gonna order?
[39:19.04]Because I ordered a hamburger and we got a fucking pizza.
[39:21.44]Oh, I'm sorry.
[39:21.86]I probably shouldn't have said that.
[39:22.92]I want the Bean Eagles pizza.
[39:26.48]That employee.
[39:27.98]You're gonna have to talk about this employee.
[39:30.30]Because that was, uh... That was, like, the mistake number five.
[39:33.45]It's okay.
[39:33.81]I work here.
[39:35.53]Well, it's now two.
[39:37.31]Can I get some firemans in chat?
[39:40.31]How are you sitting?
[39:42.47]I sat down in my room.
[39:44.75]Okay, so...
[39:47.81]What happened to my mug?
[39:53.28]You know what?
[39:53.88]No, no, no.
[39:54.34]I want to see the kitchen.
[39:58.04]I want to see the kitchen.
[40:00.88]Damn it.
[40:01.29]I want to see the kitchen.
[40:03.83]Oh, God.
[40:04.19]Somebody call the police.
[40:05.87]Sorry.
[40:06.27]I hit the table.
[40:11.89]Who is sitting this close to me?
[40:13.27]What's going on?
[40:13.89]You took a photo of me in the restaurant?
[40:16.55]Yeah.
[40:18.17]Yeah.
[40:18.83]I'm sorry.
[40:19.73]I mean, you could have asked permission for it.
[40:21.21]Like, all these cameras.
[40:22.17]Can you believe this?
[40:23.17]This is ridiculous.
[40:25.45]We're just being followed.
[40:27.37]We're being robbed.
[40:29.03]Give the pizza back.
[40:31.36]Jesus.
[40:32.89]Uh, if I don't get a- I'm trying to enjoy my meal!

[40:55.15]Oh, did anyone order pizza, anyway?
[40:56.78]Like, I'll have a half-eaten slice.
[40:59.26]Like, a half-eaten slice, anyone?
[41:02.44]Woohoo!
[41:04.36]I can offer 20% off coupon.
[41:06.14]Oh, I just ripped the corner.
[41:07.55]All right, can we, I don't know.
[41:12.31]How is this place even, like, still in?
[41:13.97]Is this what I look like?
[41:15.15]Why do I look like Doug Funny?
[41:16.75]Who ordered a burger?
[41:18.96]Who ordered a burger?
[41:23.00]I ordered the hamburger.
[41:24.04]I ordered the hamburger.
[41:25.02]It was me.
[41:27.80]There's a piece of cheese and two pieces of bread.
[41:33.03]Did you even try, mate?
[41:36.39]Look at this.
[41:37.87]Look at this.
[41:40.25]A slice of cheese.
[41:42.75]That's all that's in there.
[41:43.73]Fucking rubbish.
[41:46.53]That is the worst rat burger I've ever seen.
[41:49.29]Did you just take that from me?
[41:50.41]What the fuck is this?
[41:51.17]It's in the fucking window.
[41:52.21]Stop swearing!
[41:53.98]I just voice cracked.
[41:54.72]Is it not good enough for you?
[41:55.50]Oh, sorry.
[41:56.16]What about just the plate?
[41:57.72]There were a couple of chips on the side.
[42:00.02]You can't be back there.
[42:05.30]That's true.
[42:05.70]You don't think of this place as this for a Yelp review.
[42:08.88]I don't have access.
[42:14.14]Guys, you know you have to pay for this, right?
[42:19.97]I paid in... I paid in photos.
[42:27.56]Yeah, I'm out.
[42:38.25]You paid in exposure.
[42:50.31]Alright, are we moving on?
[42:51.83]I don't know, were there any other actual games?
[42:56.23]We can go to Featured Games.
[42:59.55]There's Paintball, Golden Trophy, The Streets, Newtown, Reborn.
[43:06.64]We did a couple of these.
[43:07.52]Hide and Seek.
[43:10.20]You want to play Hide and Seek, just me and you?
[43:12.44]Oh my god, no.
[43:15.92]Lemonade Simulator.
[43:22.71]Uh, there's mini-golf.
[43:25.13]Is it Arkham?
[43:25.65]Oh, mini-golf!
[43:26.25]No, I don't want to play that game.
[43:28.47]Mini-golf is... Yeah, I don't think it's very fun.
[43:32.16]What do you guys think?
[43:35.42]I don't know why you can't make a private one.
[43:44.18]Everyone's, like, screaming to do mini-golf.
[43:47.57]Do furry hangout.
[43:48.99]What are you talking about?
[43:50.97]Oh, fuck.
[43:53.12]No, I ain't doing that.
[43:54.56]Alright, let's do Slender 8 Pages.
[44:06.98]That would be on here.
[44:08.62]You ready to do Slender Man 8 Pages?
[44:11.59]I'll follow you.
[44:13.13]Does somebody get to be Slender Man?
[44:14.39]It would be you.
[44:18.31]I'm done being tall.
[44:22.97]How do we start?
[44:26.55]Can't run.
[44:28.11]Always watch us.
[44:28.87]Don't look.
[44:31.17]I can't join you.
[44:31.82]It says game full.
[44:34.20]Really?
[44:35.42]Well, come now.
[44:36.10]Come now.
[44:36.54]Come now.
[44:38.54]I actually think it's only two people can enter the woods.
[44:41.02]Just me and you.
[44:41.52]Yeah, it's just me.
[44:46.93]There we go.
[44:47.41]All right.
[44:47.93]Only two can enter.
[44:49.67]Hey.
[44:49.85]Hey.
[44:50.63]Hey, what's going on?
[44:52.85]How does it feel being up there?
[44:54.05]Feels pretty good.
[44:56.13]Why can I not hit you in the head?
[44:59.66]Because this is a non-violent game.
[45:02.92]The only thing you can do is... Okay, that was creepy.
[45:07.90]Why did that happen?
[45:09.52]Alright, before you go... Do you want to press this button, or what do we do?
[45:22.27]What are you doing?
[45:26.05]No, no, we didn't even read the rules.
[45:27.71]What are you doing?
[45:31.96]You didn't even let me read the rules.
[45:33.74]I'm in.
[45:34.12]Okay.
[45:35.08]Where are you?
[45:43.72]Get a flashlight.
[45:44.90]Get a flashlight.
[45:45.60]Throw me one.
[45:46.74]I'll throw it to you.
[45:47.95]Hold on.
[45:52.52]You have to come get it.
[45:53.30]I can't throw it to you.
[45:55.60]This doesn't even do anything.
[45:56.87]This just hurts.
[45:57.61]This is just like a filter on the screen.
[45:59.99]Here.
[46:03.21]All right.
[46:05.17]This is bad.
[46:05.87]I kind of don't want the flashlight.
[46:13.13]Thanks.
[46:13.69]You just put that right in my face.
[46:15.09]All right, let's go.
[46:19.21]So we can find the first page.
[46:22.07]Yeah, I'm trying to welcome that.
[46:25.62]Hold on, I think your voice is still coming through.
[46:28.50]Oh yeah, I can turn that off.
[46:32.60]Yeah, you definitely should.
[46:35.68]Okay.
[46:37.02]You ready to go find the eight pages?
[46:39.39]Yeah.
[46:41.27]I wish there was a camera on you right now, because I'd love to know what the hell you're doing.
[46:45.45]I'm crawling!
[46:46.15]Alright, I can't- I need you!
[46:52.10]Will you stand up and just play?
[46:54.46]You are ruining my stream!
[46:56.22]Did this hit?
[47:10.31]Okay, let's go.
[47:14.41]Oh, uh, hey, behind you there might be a... Is there a page?
[47:17.53]Like over there?
[47:19.43]Like... Oh, he really is right here!
[47:24.80]This is not the Kingdom Hearts version of this character.
[47:30.38]As long as the flashlight's on him, can he not move?
[47:32.75]Look at how muscular his legs are.
[47:34.43]He looks a little inflated.
[47:35.69]You know those things on Halloween?
[47:39.67]The big displays that you walk by and they go... And they say a line about eating you.
[47:46.97]That's what this thing is.
[47:54.99]He's gonna get you.
[47:55.71]I don't think he will.
[48:02.94]He's ignoring you!
[48:03.78]Wait, wait, wait!
[48:06.16]Go get him!
[48:06.96]What are you doing?
[48:07.54]Let's follow him.
[48:11.55]Alright, yeah, we gotta follow him.
[48:16.95]Hey!
[48:17.11]Is he collecting the notes now?
[48:20.27]Is it his turn?
[48:20.73]Yeah, we're the annoying ones.
[48:28.60]Uh, okay, that's a little odd.
[48:32.09]This is scarier somehow.
[48:38.15]Uppy!
[48:38.97]Daddy, Uppy!
[48:39.89]Hey, just have him grab you in the face.
[48:49.70]I tried to.
[48:52.00]I think we have to... I think he killed me.
[48:55.20]It killed you.
[48:55.74]I was gonna say, maybe we get to trap him in a Ghostbusters proton beam.
[49:06.11]How long have we been in rec room for?
[49:07.99]We've got like four or five other games to play.
[49:10.45]Yeah.
[49:11.39]What's next?
[49:11.85]What do you want to do next?
[49:15.37]I don't remember the list.
[49:16.43]Neither do I.
[49:22.47]Uh, we could do Survive.
[49:24.03]What do you want to do?
[49:24.61]That is the only one that I did not download.
[49:27.37]Why didn't you download that?
[49:29.77]It wouldn't start, and then I just figured... I figured it'd be fine.
[49:34.65]You didn't download the game.
[49:36.33]Like, the co-op horror shooter game.
[49:41.11]It could start.
[49:42.86]Well, start downloading it now, and we'll play... Alright, guys, I got some... I got some really, really interesting news for everybody.
[49:50.98]Uh...
[49:51.90]The last thing that we're going to play is Desert Bus VR.
[49:56.24]So we're going to try to take the whole eight-hour trip at the end of the stream.
[50:07.15]Oh, wow.
[50:07.53]Star really ruined the stream.
[50:11.27]Dude, just go to the furry room.
[50:13.15]I don't want to go to... I'll be done downloading in a second.
[50:15.26]Oh, my God.
[50:17.14]No, dude.
[50:17.76]I don't want to...
[50:24.51]You get 15 seconds, okay?
[50:25.83]10 seconds.
[50:29.09]Uh, it says 3 minutes to download.
[50:33.03]My mic turned the fuck off.
[50:35.49]I ain't gonna like... I thought I just did that for a second.
[50:38.59]That was weird.
[50:38.99]Pretty good.
[50:40.87]I'm just gonna go in and look, and I'm gonna look... We're just gonna go in and look.
[50:47.17]Why did I just do that?
[50:50.10]I just got pressured.
[50:51.08]Alright, you get 15 seconds.
[50:56.18]I don't care if you're furry.
[50:57.70]It's not a problem.
[50:58.50]I don't give a shit.
[51:03.78]I don't care if you're furry.
[51:04.75]I just don't want to see you.
[51:11.99]How did you know I was going to go here?
[51:18.46]Well, the Iron Giant's really cool.
[51:20.12]I'll tell you.
[51:20.58]My favorite part about this is the Iron Giant.
[51:23.58]Is that the Iron Giant?
[51:25.68]It is.
[51:28.19]Nice, okay.
[51:30.75]Can I go up here and like spin records?
[51:36.50]How do I turn this on?
[51:39.62]Do I think I have to have special DJ permission to use this?
[51:50.55]That's a pretty cool Spiral the Dragon costume.
[51:52.45]I want to see it.
[51:56.22]That's a pretty awesome Spiral of the Dragon.
[52:03.95]Spiral.
[52:05.79]And then, I don't know what that other one is.
[52:09.77]What's going on?
[52:10.43]Is all this stuff going on up here?
[52:13.33]That's a VIP area.
[52:14.37]You can't go up there unless you're VIP.
[52:16.65]I'm going to respect the rules.
[52:18.53]Here's the newest costumes.
[52:19.57]Okay.
[52:22.29]Spiral of the Dragon.
[52:23.51]What did I tell you?
[52:32.56]Uh-oh.
[52:35.58]Uh... Alright, survive is... I'm launching it.
[52:40.54]Am I, like, stealing a costume?
[52:43.66]I think I'm actually... I think I'm taking this.
[52:45.80]No, I gotta put this back.
[52:46.80]This is, like... It's theft.
[52:52.38]Alright, you're launching it?
[52:54.30]Yeah.
[52:54.82]There you go.
[52:55.16]There's your 15 seconds.
[53:08.69]Okay, how do I get out?
[53:13.25]What's the out button?
[53:15.35]Dorm room right there.
[53:18.91]This is actually pretty cool.
[53:20.05]If you could make something get like in a cool room with your friends, hang out.
[53:24.43]You know what my favorite thing about your streams is?
[53:26.96]Is after you play like a shit game for an hour, you always come out with the positives.
[53:34.82]How is this a shit game?
[53:38.49]Is Roblox a shit game?
[53:43.67]You don't have to answer that.
[53:49.41]I didn't even do this.
[53:50.14]This is why I looked like a default character.
[53:53.06]I didn't have any personality, for God's sakes.
[53:54.96]Alright.
[53:55.18]Let me just take off my toupee.
[53:58.22]Alright, I'm gonna open up Survive.
[54:03.84]First, I have to, like, YouTube or Funny Break something.
[54:09.53]didn't even work all right time to change games to survive in fact let me just pull up for a second all right there we go so uh are you in survive right now yeah
[54:37.77]I'm a furry and I hated that.
[54:39.69]I didn't, I just went in.
[54:40.93]I just, it was alright.
[54:41.61]I just put on the Spiral of the Dragon uniform.
[54:43.41]Alright, survive.
[54:52.35]Why is the rec room still open?
[54:56.39]That was weird.
[55:00.79]So how self-explanatory is it to get in a room?
[55:06.24]I don't know, it like starts you in this really weird room.
[55:09.08]I'm gonna change my name.
[55:11.85]So we're gonna, we're doing a, this is a co-op zombie survival game.
[55:18.07]It has like an H1Z1 title.
[55:21.55]That I can't even put it into this, yeah, there we go.
[55:27.19]It's H1Z1 with like an extra S and a U. Oh god, I'm in.
[55:34.58]That was sudden.
[55:39.61]Okay.
[55:44.92]Going back in.
[55:51.98]Okay, I love, I exited rec room and like 300 people came back.
[55:59.56]It's fun.
[56:00.14]Come on.
[56:00.52]It was a fun experience.
[56:03.88]Going back in.
[56:13.53]So this game just jumps out at you, you said?
[56:18.76]You're in a room.
[56:19.78]It gives you some options for how you want to turn and move.
[56:23.08]I would go through it real quick.
[56:24.64]And as soon as you're done, it throws you to a main menu.
[56:28.21]Okay.
[56:29.99]But I don't see how to join each other, so I'm looking around.
[56:33.73]See if you can figure it out while I stuff my face in here.
[56:45.22]Oh, you have to beep the tutorial for co-op.
[56:47.82]God damn it.
[56:48.64]I got like face grease all over this shit already.
[56:51.46]Come on.
[56:52.38]Hold on.
[57:05.69]Already?
[57:06.01]It's only been like fucking 30 minutes.
[57:09.43]How long has it been?
[57:10.11]Has it been longer than that?
[57:14.99]How fucking long have I been streaming?
[57:17.78]Holy shit, it's been more than an hour.
[57:19.84]Nevermind.
[57:20.58]All right, that's better.
[57:29.20]All right, welcome to survive.
[57:30.21]All right, for the best play experience you're supposed to answer... How do I walk?
[57:42.95]What the fuck is happening?
[57:45.15]Is that a glue man shirt on?
[57:46.27]For best play, you are supposed to answer a few questions.
[57:50.25]You can freely update all options later, as well as play this wizard again.
[57:54.15]The game has many other options.
[57:55.53]Use the sign in main... Okay, that's better.
[58:07.68]Okay.
[58:09.58]Use your finger to start here, but touch here with your finger.
[58:15.75]How tall are you?
[58:17.03]We've automatically set your height, but this will work only if your VR device is correctly set up.
[58:21.43]Feel free to override it manually.
[58:38.46]This looks right.
[58:39.56]This looks correct.
[58:41.28]OK, that's good.
[58:45.16]Who are you?
[58:45.64]Who did you pick?
[58:48.06]Steve.
[58:48.96]Okay, you picked Steve.
[58:55.15]I want to be Steve too, though.
[58:57.53]I'll be Jason.
[58:59.85]Do you want to see your body?
[59:00.59]This will not influence how other players will see you.
[59:04.13]No, I like it.
[59:05.50]I like seeing me.
[59:06.18]I think that's fine.
[59:13.12]How do you like to choose pad and stick?
[59:16.66]What the fuck is going on there?
[59:19.66]Arm swing.
[59:27.45]I think I'm gonna do arm swing.
[59:37.28]How do you like to turn?
[59:39.52]What is HMD?
[59:42.45]I have no idea.
[59:43.95]I set mine to snap.
[59:46.75]Snap turn?
[59:48.35]Yeah, so when you thumb stick, it just snaps you.
[59:51.15]Guns volume.
[59:52.16]I'm going to turn guns volume on normal.
[59:54.74]There's only normal and realistic.
[59:56.56]What does that mean?
[59:57.44]Is it louder on realistic?
[59:58.60]Realistic is very loud.
[60:00.34]Would recommend.
[60:01.00]This is not an arcade game.
[60:03.40]You want me to peak my microphone?
[60:07.72]What?
[60:08.32]Why do you want me to peak my microphone?
[60:10.71]I want you to peak your microphone with realistic gun sounds.
[60:13.75]No checkpoints for nightmare.
[60:15.03]Okay, what are we doing?
[60:16.01]Survivor or No Future?
[60:20.48]Sissy, can I play daddy?
[60:23.14]How about just Survivor?
[60:24.16]Okay.
[60:31.54]Story mode starts with chapter zero prologue.
[60:34.60]It's a real tutorial.
[60:40.62]Oh, we still... Okay, so we just have to... Alright, story... Oh, I've got it.
[60:49.45]And then story will give you a tutorial you have to do, and I'll wait for you at the end.
[60:52.67]Okay.
[61:03.18]Can you guys hear this?
[61:04.74]Infection Day 417 Chapter 0 Prologue Tutorial.
[61:22.22]Alright, that didn't seem correct.
[61:36.17]Okay, okay.
[61:36.91]Whoa, wait a minute.
[61:41.66]Why is this happening?
[61:42.54]Why is it doing this?
[61:49.12]Why am I doing this?
[61:52.88]Arms swing!
[61:57.50]Stop moving!
[61:58.22]How do I stop?
[62:08.65]Okay, there's a zombie right there.
[62:11.05]I hate this.
[62:12.65]I hate this.
[62:13.35]How do I... Where's the button until I go to the menu?
[62:34.24]Must track that in any direction to sprint.
[62:40.30]Something's not right here.
[62:41.28]Okay.
[62:46.96]Press the grip button to grab.
[62:50.64]It's just moving me around.
[62:51.69]Okay.
[62:56.39]Kneeling spray is limited, so use it carefully.
[62:58.45]How do I put it away?
[62:59.73]You have a...
[63:04.52]Bags on your waist.
[63:05.36]And you can put them in the right one.
[63:15.45]Did it tell you how to do that?
[63:17.91]No.
[63:19.21]It tells you later.
[63:20.40]Wait, why?
[63:22.68]What?
[63:22.90]Just go with the tutorial.
[63:24.10]Stop stressing out about this apocalypse.
[63:26.24]I have to change the controls, man.
[63:31.02]These are terrible.
[63:32.69]Why did I think this was a good idea?
[63:44.73]Are you lefty?
[63:45.59]Press and hold menu button to change trackpad between locomotion or action mode.
[63:51.59]Okay, that's better.
[63:55.48]Not really, though.
[63:57.76]Freaking arm swing.
[64:04.20]Duck to get through.
[64:05.98]Center, press left touchpad.
[64:10.68]This is so fucked up right now.
[64:13.86]Like, every time I move any direct... Press left touchpad, playing in seated position.
[64:21.60]I'm not in a seated position.
[64:25.14]How do I fucking move?
[64:26.30]I should have just done goddamn teleport.
[64:38.29]Okay, trigger button to grab.
[64:41.49]Oh my god, stop moving.
[64:43.35]Yeah, grab a magazine.
[64:51.25]Yeah.
[65:15.41]How do I put another one of these in?
[65:22.90]How do I release this?
[65:31.08]How do you get rid of the magazine?
[65:34.46]You press E or one of the buttons on your hand?
[65:45.72]Alright.
[65:51.04]Underground flashlight.
[65:52.24]Touch underground flashlight.
[66:08.73]I can't- I cannot wait to go to a menu and turn this shit off.
[66:13.78]Like even aiming my gun is making me like walk.
[66:30.91]Yeah!
[66:47.50]Press down on the trackpad.
[66:49.04]Down.
[66:57.51]Okay.
[66:58.87]Probably almost done here.
[67:01.40]It's actually a lot longer.
[67:03.26]Is it longer?
[67:05.42]Like, I don't know when this ends still.
[67:07.40]Oh god, you're still in it?
[67:09.32]Yeah.
[67:12.54]Put objects in your backpack.
[67:18.69]No, not yet.
[67:20.23]Not yet.
[67:23.23]Okay, you're just gonna throw it behind you.
[67:24.57]Can I have three objects?
[67:31.68]That's in my backpack, right?
[67:33.04]No, it's not.
[67:38.02]That's how you know.
[67:39.60]Okay.
[67:39.80]Oh, man.
[67:46.32]Oh, man.
[67:50.25]No, I'm trying to.
[67:52.69]Fuck.
[67:54.71]How can I tell what's in my backpack?
[67:59.82]Can I get in my backpack?
[68:01.92]I just took the bullets out.
[68:05.30]What was I thinking doing this?
[68:09.58]Yeah, I have no idea how to get into your backpack.
[68:12.66]Uh, sidearms and weapons and...
[68:30.23]Okay, you can keep three magazines in your belt.
[68:38.39]Did that go in my belt?
[68:49.08]I think so, yeah.
[68:54.81]I don't know if this is the tutorial or the whole game.
[68:58.55]Didn't it say once we get to the end of the tutorial, we can play together?
[69:01.27]I know, but this feels unreasonably long.
[69:03.85]Fight together, that's what it says.
[69:05.13]Are you sure?
[69:22.68]Vive inside.
[69:27.82]This looks like a safe house.
[69:32.28]Press grip to grab the drill.
[69:33.82]Okay.
[69:33.92]What the fuck?
[69:34.32]So this...
[69:53.21]Okay, this is definitely it.
[69:55.66]Speak, friend, and enter.
[69:56.70]This is it.
[69:57.10]Right?
[69:57.26]It has to be.
[69:57.80]Fight together.
[69:58.30]How do I invite you?
[69:58.92]I don't know.
[69:59.26]I assume that was still in the tutorial.
[70:00.96]Is it... Is it like a start menu?
[70:02.22]No, it is not.
[70:02.56]Does anybody know...
[70:21.12]I've got to get back to the controls.
[70:22.48]Anybody have any idea?
[70:23.44]I can't smash the TV.
[70:24.98]Zero out of ten.
[70:25.38]Arms up to enter the menu.
[70:26.26]What a liar.
[70:47.84]There's a button to skip the tutorial at the very beginning.
[70:51.82]You want to just reload and press the button?
[70:55.18]I think I'm probably at the end.
[70:57.10]You can skip and I can explain anything.
[70:59.70]I don't know how to leave the game though.
[71:07.46]I have to turn this shit off.
[71:08.58]I'm just fucking gonna quit the game.
[71:10.18]This actually is a text-to-speech voice.
[71:12.22]I'm just gonna fucking sprint.
[71:36.39]You can keep two melee on your side.
[71:38.05]This seems like fun.
[71:41.75]Alright, two melees at your side.
[71:46.79]You're gonna have to give me the fucking turret.
[71:57.42]Okay, it's checkpoint.
[72:05.33]Oh man, come on.
[72:11.07]How do I open the door?
[72:12.49]What if I drill?
[72:17.12]Open it to unlock a... Got it.
[72:29.48]It worked.
[72:31.06]Oops.
[72:41.78]All right, Cole.
[72:44.20]Do you see how fucking odd this is?
[72:45.76]No.
[72:48.03]It's so fucking throw-up inducing.
[72:52.89]Fucking Gangaplow.
[72:53.43]I'm going to keep complaining about it over and over again.
[72:56.32]It's my stupid brain that decided to do it.
[73:00.28]What decided to do it?
[73:00.84]I just hit my fucking face on the car door.
[73:12.11]What is this?
[73:13.05]What's this, like, popsicle bag?
[73:19.52]Okay, I mean, I've gotten to a second safe house now.
[73:24.24]I'm just gonna skip the tutorial and see where I am.
[73:31.27]Turn the gun on yourself, turn the gun on yourself.
[73:39.15]Oh, fuck, this is a checkpoint!
[74:04.92]I have to complete it.
[74:06.50]I think we have to complete this, dude.
[74:09.12]Oh, I just quit.
[74:11.06]Press the... Can I just, like... Oh, look, it starts now playing Survive.
[74:26.91]You run.
[74:30.84]All right, let's...
[74:37.74]Damn it!
[74:38.20]I have to like exit.
[74:42.04]Do I actually have to go home?
[74:45.54]He's mad.
[74:47.82]Why can't there just be like some kind of start menu?
[74:54.86]Don't you have like a DMVR button to open up that menu and close it?
[75:01.41]Uh, where is it?
[75:06.16]Screen savers?
[75:07.47]No, what?
[75:08.91]No, these are Steam friends.
[75:10.15]There it is.
[75:11.45]Okay, let's go.
[75:13.43]Oh no.
[75:15.69]Skip the tutorial.
[75:17.35]I can't.
[75:17.83]What do you mean you can't?
[75:19.26]Because I reached checkpoints and it saved my game so it didn't start me at the beginning.
[75:24.86]I clicked story and it just started me back where I was.
[75:29.51]Is there like a new profile?
[75:33.81]But thank God I can at least turn this shit off.
[75:38.86]For the love of God.
[75:44.80]I can't even read what that says.
[75:47.50]Can anybody fucking read this?
[75:49.96]Wait a minute.
[75:54.36]How close am I to something?
[76:02.58]Had and...
[76:04.36]Stick.
[76:08.50]Standing.
[76:18.13]So you're telling me that we can't... Are you sure?
[76:24.61]Players.
[76:25.59]Two player.
[76:30.28]Fuck.
[76:35.73]He's doing teleport.
[76:52.08]So are you- do we actually- we actually have to do this anyway.
[76:57.44]This is disappointing.
[77:06.61]Wait a minute.
[77:07.43]I can skip the tutorial.
[77:09.39]How?
[77:10.27]I just had to start... I just started it over again.
[77:14.28]Never mind.
[77:14.74]That's a lie.
[77:17.78]Uh-huh.
[77:18.72]Why is this... Why is this still doing this?
[77:20.84]I did teleport.
[77:22.52]I didn't save the settings?
[77:24.88]What?
[77:25.18]I thought I... Oh!
[77:25.66]Okay.
[77:46.18]Are you sure?
[77:46.87]I thought I hit save settings like twice.
[77:48.99]Oh, fucking god.
[77:49.63]Give me a break.
[77:50.41]Are you sure I didn't hit save settings?
[78:24.89]Hello?
[78:40.46]Just add a start menu.
[78:42.14]Like hold this button down for like three seconds for something.
[78:46.89]That's like, come on.
[78:48.99]What the heck?
[78:52.39]Gotta like quit the game to go to the menu.
[78:54.80]Or am I insane?
[79:27.22]Alright, uh, are you still in like the room with me?
[79:30.92]What?
[79:31.71]There is a start menu.
[79:33.13]How did I get to it?
[79:44.97]Okay, so apparently we get a tablet at the end of the tutorial to like have a menu.
[79:52.40]Are you still doing the tutorial?
[79:54.19]I can't figure out anything else to do, so I'm doing it.
[79:59.69]Alright, I'm just... I'm just running through.
[80:03.03]If only we knew we should just press the goddamn big red button.
[80:07.74]I don't know what's going to be in the story when the tutorial is showing you every feature in the game.
[80:22.55]God fucking dammit, I'm gonna scream.
[80:25.10]How am I supposed to reliably teleport?
[80:28.98]And this is even somehow, this is how it works.
[80:32.20]Whoa!
[80:32.72]Put up my gun.
[80:51.46]Remain on air to provide news and information to the public and inside areas.
[80:56.74]This is WNSC.
[80:57.18]We'll continue to serve the city.
[81:01.87]I guess I'm full over here.
[81:04.25]You should tune to stations providing news and information for your local area.
[81:08.49]I don't have a gun to shoot this.
[81:10.09]Emergency alert system serving the Santa Carla City area.
[81:14.68]Do not use your telephone.
[81:16.88]I have a gun!
[81:19.40]Where's my gun?
[81:24.00]I can't go through there without a gun.
[81:25.76]Give me out of this fucking room!
[81:29.16]Why didn't I... I went down here!
[81:30.83]Oh my god.
[82:00.54]You don't seem too good.
[82:01.70]Oh my god.
[82:02.95]Okay, just give me an axe.
[82:05.97]I'm fucking going as fast as I can.
[82:10.81]Is there anything over here?
[82:32.22]Can I hold this with two hands?
[82:54.84]Hey, I made it!
[83:03.29]Does it matter which way I go here?
[83:04.97]Probably not.
[83:13.38]It's fun!
[83:21.02]It's not a sidearm.
[83:26.11]Okay.
[83:26.41]Alright.
[83:37.71]You'll be done in about an hour.
[83:39.89]No.
[83:43.88]I'm still going.
[83:44.74]Are you still in Victoria?
[83:46.82]Yeah.
[83:47.24]Come on.
[83:50.24]Why didn't we just press the button?
[83:52.46]I'm hoping that when I get to the end, I can invite you or something.
[83:54.92]I hope so.
[83:55.76]What's going on here?
[84:11.47]Uh, eh... Disguise as a zombie.
[84:15.63]You can, like, dump goo all over yourself.
[84:19.02]Grab the stew.
[84:25.10]Okay.
[84:26.82]Zombies do not attack you, but stay away from them, so don't use any gun or object.
[84:31.81]Be quiet.
[84:32.27]It's kind of hard to see.
[84:38.29]Ah!
[84:40.12]I pressed it!
[84:40.52]I pressed the button!
[84:41.96]I think that skips the tutorial!
[84:48.14]Oh well.
[85:00.13]Did I hit a button?
[85:19.32]I need a flashlight.
[85:23.38]Where's the flashlight?
[85:24.82]I had one before.
[85:25.66]If only we just pressed the fucking red button.
[85:32.31]I think I'm at the end.
[85:33.71]Oh, thank God.
[85:34.73]Please invite me.
[85:36.25]Get me out of this hell.
[85:42.61]I've got tablets and walkie-talkies.
[85:45.46]Please.
[85:45.80]Roger that.
[85:57.40]Is this how I open this door?
[86:03.64]I did it!
[86:13.00]Oh no.
[86:14.20]What?
[86:14.36]Why are you oh no No-ing?
[86:16.14]Don't oh no right now.
[86:17.42]That's not what we need.
[86:18.68]We don't need an oh no.
[86:20.82]We need like an oh yes.
[86:25.00]I think this is part two of the tutorial.
[86:27.12]No, it's not.
[86:27.78]I mean, it still said said chapter zero.
[86:33.94]I couldn't open that before, why?
[86:37.40]What, honest to God, is going on with this teleport?
[86:41.29]I'm like, I have like a whip in my hand.
[86:43.99]I can't go further?
[86:56.28]Waterbender over here.
[86:57.37]Okay.
[86:57.53]Figure it out?
[86:58.43]Um...
[87:24.20]No.
[87:29.02]What is in my backpack right now?
[87:30.18]The spray is really loud.
[87:55.21]The hold a button.
[87:57.04]Oh.
[87:57.40]OK.
[87:57.58]So I have, I don't want this shit in there.
[88:00.28]Get that out of here.
[88:01.34]Give me this.
[88:02.10]OK.
[88:26.97]I don't care.
[88:27.73]Let's just go.
[88:28.74]We need to get to the- so we can play- The whole point is this is a co-op video game to play together.
[88:37.90]So you're not out of the tutorial?
[88:40.72]I'm... I think I'm getting the tutorial to when the game isn't a tutorial.
[88:49.21]They gave me the tablet and it has like, find a game on it, but it's grayed out.
[88:55.01]But I don't know how I wouldn't bite you.
[88:57.76]At this point, it would probably actually be faster if we uninstalled the game and then reinstalled the game and then skipped its tournament.
[89:06.81]All I know is I'm feeling sick having to walk here.
[89:10.99]No!
[89:11.85]No!
[89:20.66]That didn't go in my holster.
[89:22.76]There's a monster in here.
[89:24.56]I need to drill.
[89:25.62]Do you need to drill?
[89:28.91]Is there already a gun in here?
[89:36.45]I can't open that.
[89:37.07]Ooh, this is cool.
[89:56.17]go in here.
[89:56.75]Okay.
[89:57.71]Give me the, give me this.
[89:59.03]Uh,
[91:17.50]I'm turning into the zombie.
[91:21.66]Is something going on here?
[91:23.44]Where am I in my room?
[91:25.06]Did I punch a hole in the wall?
[91:28.26]Why?
[91:30.54]Change fire mode.
[91:33.05]He just won't stop talking and telling me what to do.
[91:35.69]But he won't tell me what I really want to know, which is how to be friends.
[91:47.26]What is going on right now?
[91:52.82]Alright, that's bad.
[91:54.02]What the fuck just happened?
[91:59.49]This is like good game mechanics too.
[92:06.73]I'm like losing the track on the ground.
[92:10.09]Three magazines in your belt pouches.
[92:12.25]So you've got the front pouches.
[92:32.29]So what do you want to do about this?
[92:36.26]One of the other games we have.
[92:38.20]Do you want to keep playing in a tutorial until we can play with each other?
[92:44.58]What is that sound?
[92:48.88]Why is there somebody washing dishes?
[92:52.48]I'm going to throw up.
[93:03.68]Ah, shit.
[93:06.05]Somebody is a zombie with a shopping cart?
[93:08.97]Oh, okay.
[93:15.34]What the fuck are you doing?
[93:24.38]God damn it.
[93:30.72]All right, it might be time to make an executive decision and do something else.
[93:37.45]I... One second.
[93:39.65]If this is not the end of the tutorial... Chapter 1!
[93:46.23]I'm so far behind you, though.
[93:49.62]Tell me, like, guide me.
[93:50.42]Okay, I just got the software.
[93:51.22]Well, like, I have to see if I can invite you.
[93:52.72]Trust me, you're not going to catch up anytime soon.
[94:05.89]I'm trying to go, like, as fast as I can.
[94:08.47]Numbers, numbers, numbers.
[94:09.41]What?
[94:09.59]Is that you?
[94:13.55]This is an all-freak machine message.
[94:15.23]Are you contacting me?
[94:16.53]My name is Jeremy Stanton.
[94:17.51]Are you writing this?
[94:19.73]You're almost at the end.
[94:22.31]You need to beat this.
[94:23.47]This is the only way you get to join the session on your story mode.
[94:27.66]I'm limited by the teleport, which I'm going to probably turn off.
[94:30.48]If you want to keep going, I'm sitting on the ground and I'm going to wait for you.
[94:32.90]Okay, I'm going.
[94:39.81]So you tell me I just got the assault rifle?
[94:43.71]You have to kill like a giant group of things and you run up to a military base and you're done.
[94:54.49]Did I walk by something?
[95:10.00]There's so many resident sleepers in chat.
[95:16.04]I'm sorry.
[95:17.36]We didn't know this was going to happen.
[95:21.90]Just wake up.
[95:22.36]Just wait until we play Desert Bus.
[95:26.23]You're really going to wake the fuck up.
[95:27.61]Save your resident sleepers for Desert Bus.
[95:29.73]Okay, I made it to another room.
[95:34.25]There's a drill.
[95:37.73]You skip that room.
[95:39.63]Skip this room.
[95:41.37]It's like a safe house, right?
[95:43.15]Is it?
[95:43.39]I don't know.
[95:46.21]It's just like the army wants you or something?
[95:49.38]You want the army, guy.
[95:50.60]Are you sure I don't go in this house with the big red door?
[95:54.10]He's still...
[96:09.70]Again, no.
[96:11.64]I need a drill.
[96:13.80]I'm going with this one.
[96:16.96]All right, I got the radio.
[96:39.19]Hello?
[96:41.99]Okay, you just have to follow this dude's instructions.
[96:45.25]Don't get distracted.
[96:46.75]And as soon as you finish everything... What do you mean, as soon as I finish everything?
[96:51.71]You go into a whole other room with a bunch of guns, and he gives you, like, tutorial number two.
[96:55.40]I thought you said I was done.
[96:58.18]And then you're done.
[96:58.84]I thought you said I was done.
[97:00.86]Just follow instructions!
[97:04.66]Ah!
[97:06.66]Ah!
[97:07.54]And then we could play for like 10 minutes.
[97:11.47]Mom's calling me for supper.
[97:13.59]Put the radio on the left shoulder of your backpack.
[97:19.03]I am working on a vaccine for the V1V3 virus, but I need help.
[97:25.60]On the table, there's a tactical tablet.
[97:27.74]It can make the difference between life and death.
[97:30.54]Don't lose it.
[97:32.04]Understood?
[97:33.58]Take it and secure it on the lower
[97:36.47]It's right there.
[97:37.61]It's right there.
[97:39.27]Put it on your back?
[97:41.81]Wait, what?
[97:42.29]Why is everyone going to put this, like, fucking scholastic tablet in my pants?
[97:47.26]On your butt.
[97:48.18]Take it back.
[97:48.88]Quick.
[97:49.98]On the tablet, you can check the map and the objectives that I will give you.
[97:54.88]It won't be a walk in the park out there.
[97:57.32]And planning your movements will be crucial.
[98:00.70]Thank you!
[98:01.62]Weapons!
[98:28.15]against the corpses.
[98:28.95]Ever.
[98:31.11]As you can see, there is abundance of weapons.
[98:33.87]Charge the rifle that's on the table.
[98:36.37]I got something to say.
[98:38.17]Why not just have this room have all the, like, tutorials in it?
[98:43.99]And, like, you can play around and make sure you figure out and you understand how the game works.
[98:47.59]I don't know, man.
[98:49.65]Because this is tutorial room two.
[98:51.41]Why not have, like, a bigger tutorial room zero here?
[98:53.97]I don't know, man!
[99:02.24]You're almost ready to blow some heads up.
[99:04.01]All right, I'm ready.
[99:04.91]Now let's check the accessories.
[99:06.95]Gown scythe, lasers, special armors, and other house specials.
[99:13.79]To mount them, you need to learn first how to do it.
[99:16.42]You lied to me.
[99:17.20]Say what I've done.
[99:18.32]Biochemical can teach you.
[99:19.28]Around the city, you will find some magazines about weapons.
[99:23.84]I'll show you with a white circle on the map where to find them.
[99:27.48]You can keep those so you can read them later.
[99:31.07]I'm checking you play something else no guys give it a chance just wait just give it a chance we've put in so much time we're almost there got it
[100:07.77]Didn't we already do this?
[100:09.25]This feels like what should have been in the tutorial.
[100:12.89]I'm confused.
[100:13.69]Hello!
[100:41.43]407 days later, that's what it feels like.
[100:43.87]Yeah.
[100:48.15]Chapter 1.
[100:48.91]Bad Santa.
[100:50.29]There you go.
[100:51.57]Can we do it?
[100:52.91]On your tablet, you should have a... Find a game.
[100:59.77]Find a game.
[101:02.43]Search for an available session or join a random session.
[101:05.06]Refresh.
[101:13.31]Got it!
[101:31.04]You did it!
[101:33.32]Wait, don't say that yet.
[101:34.18]Don't say that.
[101:35.20]It said a new player has joined the game.
[101:41.14]Alright, now, how do I change my controls again?
[101:43.13]Oh, I can hear you in game.
[101:47.19]Don't move, don't move, don't move, don't move!
[101:50.25]No, don't move, don't move, trust me.
[102:02.64]That's fucking terrifying.
[102:10.69]Wow.
[102:10.91]Do you want to come join me?
[102:13.56]Yeah, um, is there, can I?
[102:16.92]Alright, wait, wait, wait.

[104:02.57]Did everybody fucking leave?
[104:10.81]Just about to get crunked.
[104:11.93]I am so sorry, guys.
[104:14.77]I'm so sorry.
[104:15.43]That took way too long.
[104:16.36]This game's going to be fun.
[104:17.30]We'll make it up for you in Desert Bus.
[104:22.50]We're going to make it up to you guys when we play Desert Bus.
[104:28.49]Welcome to VR.
[104:30.09]That's right.
[104:30.79]I'm talking to you.
[104:31.62]I know where I am.

[104:52.65]Look at me.
[105:02.67]What are you doing?
[105:03.45]Can we just do this?
[105:09.68]What are you doing?
[105:10.44]What are you talking about?
[105:12.22]Okay, get the fuck off me.
[105:18.30]Get the fuck off.
[105:19.98]Get the fuck away from me.
[105:21.50]Get away from me.
[105:26.44]Get the fuck out of here.
[105:27.32]I ain't gonna fucking have that happen.
[105:29.86]I'm ready to fight the zombies.
[105:32.91]What happened?
[105:33.57]How did I make a pretzel?
[105:35.51]What is this?
[105:36.35]What am I holding?
[105:37.67]What am I holding?
[105:40.68]What am I holding?
[105:44.12]What?
[105:52.54]I don't understand how this happened.
[106:02.78]It's on my screen, it's some sort of interpretive dance.
[106:09.70]Just wait for Desert Bus, you guys are gonna have to, you're gonna be fucking lit up for it.
[106:20.81]Oh shit, oh this is, I think, did I rip it out?
[106:23.45]No, I'm good.
[106:27.86]Okay, that is fucking out of control.
[106:35.33]Alright, let's play this goddamn game.
[106:43.42]Stop!
[106:44.34]Stop, you dick!
[106:45.52]You're gonna kill me!
[106:46.42]It's killing me, do you understand?
[106:47.98]Wish I could be so lucky.
[107:05.85]And I gotta revive?
[107:06.75]Oh no, did it boot us?
[107:23.82]I think it booted us.
[107:25.72]I'm here.
[107:26.52]Okay.
[107:27.08]I'm right here.
[107:27.58]Are you sure?
[107:28.16]Yeah.
[107:33.18]I...
[107:36.02]We took so long to get here.
[107:44.88]Hold on, give me one of these.
[108:01.43]What are you doing?
[108:09.86]Stop.
[108:10.98]Stop.
[108:11.60]Alright.
[108:13.94]No.
[108:14.22]I need to live.
[108:16.42]I have kids.
[108:22.32]I can't.
[108:22.76]We have to.
[108:24.66]It's not.
[108:28.20]You know this is going to be better than the game.
[108:30.80]Is it though?
[108:31.42]Are you sure about that?
[108:33.32]Positive.
[108:36.20]Alright.
[108:37.24]Where are you?
[108:40.01]Soldier!
[108:40.82]Why do you have to keep sitting on the ground?
[108:42.86]Because otherwise I'm like up here.
[108:46.94]You're like eight frames a second, by the way.
[108:51.76]The game is not like... You are not supposed to be here.
[108:58.63]This is gonna be very odd.
[108:59.99]That's so fucked up.
[109:01.17]That's not normal.
[109:04.19]Alright, soldier.
[109:06.17]Isn't he fucking huge?
[109:07.01]Grab your gun.
[109:10.30]You don't have to look, just cock it.
[109:11.50]It's already got bolts in it.
[109:12.28]Okay, you put that in your ear.
[109:15.87]You put that inside of your, you're storing that like a hamster.
[109:25.02]Come on, you think you can shoot me?
[109:26.06]Is that what you think, huh?
[109:39.04]Alright, your turn.
[109:40.27]Let me see if I can shoot you.
[109:41.95]Okay.
[109:46.35]Which way is the right way?
[109:51.33]Are we ever going to know what happens to Santa?
[109:54.06]No.
[109:55.66]Oh, you wrecked my face.
[109:56.38]Alright, is there a sniper rifle?
[109:59.36]Yeah, over here.
[110:03.46]This is so awkward.
[110:05.87]All right, so I want a scope on this.
[110:09.29]This might be the scope.
[110:12.67]Is that?
[110:12.97]No, it's right over here.
[110:15.72]Is this a scope?
[110:20.78]Oh, yeah.
[110:21.86]Oh, there we go.
[110:22.42]Hey, thank you.
[110:25.74]That's not working.
[110:26.56]Catch it, catch it, catch it.
[110:27.76]That's not working, you claymation motherfucker.
[110:34.08]How does this go on?
[110:38.57]How do you put on scopes?
[110:50.86]I didn't even get a chance to dodge.
[110:52.36]Are you holding the scope in one hand?
[111:00.62]You're a genius.
[111:06.75]This got so much more fun.
[111:08.23]This is Groundhog Day.
[111:09.57]It really is, but it doesn't matter.
[111:11.23]We'll get it out of our system in the next 20 minutes.
[111:16.76]Alright, let's... No, get away from me!
[111:28.62]One in each ear.
[111:30.24]Oh, my hand.
[111:48.76]I think grenades in this game.
[111:53.62]I hope so.
[111:54.88]That's fucking ridiculous.
[112:04.11]Find a grenade so we can play with one.
[112:09.40]What's over here?
[112:18.73]That's not a grenade.
[112:22.59]Go look under there for a grenade.
[112:33.22]No friendly fire with melee, apparently.
[112:38.90]All right.
[112:41.68]Okay.
[112:41.96]We're done.
[112:52.06]Drop it.
[112:57.67]Drop it.
[112:58.73]Right now.

[117:48.72]If you can find my favorite gun, then nice.
[117:55.27]There's a bad gash on your leg, you fucking idiot.
[118:06.34]No, you ran out of time.
[118:07.30]That's alright.
[118:09.66]Uh, it's this one.
[118:12.50]The default handgun.
[118:14.48]Don't make me look like an idiot.
[118:16.00]It's, uh... Where's the deagle?
[118:18.95]This is a deagle, right?
[118:22.89]Yeah, that's a deagle.
[118:24.11]Is this a deagle, Chet?
[118:27.35]Which one of these is the deagle?
[118:31.47]The bigger one.
[118:32.75]This is the big one.
[118:39.39]Will you get away from me?
[118:51.68]Okay.
[118:51.88]This is the one I like the most.
[118:54.34]I like to do the dual, uh, what's his name?
[118:57.95]Deadpool?
[118:58.91]What is that?

[119:09.07]Come on!
[119:24.17]Get me out of here.
[119:25.23]Can you just get some guns and slide them to the door?
[119:29.29]Just get a few guns and slide them to me to the door.
[119:31.47]I don't care what they are.
[119:33.91]Look, I'm just going to take... Whoa.
[119:34.93]Okay.
[119:35.21]Okay.
[119:53.42]No, no, no, no.
[119:54.40]Just because I did it to you, doesn't mean you should do it to me.
[120:01.99]I'm gonna fucking quit the game.
[120:05.71]I was getting ready.
[120:07.27]Oh yeah, you were doing like the crab shotgun walk.
[120:11.25]No, but the one before that when you shot me in the head twice.
[120:13.71]Yeah, but I couldn't help it.
[120:15.05]That's a shit excuse.
[120:19.77]No, okay.
[120:21.27]I'm getting ready.
[120:23.97]Okay.
[120:24.33]We're gonna go shoot zombies.
[120:31.35]Don't even look at each other.
[120:32.09]Don't look at me.
[120:43.01]I like this.
[120:43.41]I like that.
[120:55.56]I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
[121:06.41]Okay.
[121:07.75]Get first aid.
[121:08.37]First aid is over here.
[121:19.18]You didn't take that, by the way.

[124:05.10]Everyone in the chat was fucking screaming at me to shoot you.
[124:08.46]They would like crouch down here and wait for him and shoot him in the back of the head.
[124:10.92]And I was like, guys, we have to play the goddamn game.

[125:59.40]That actually looked kind of cool.
[126:01.22]How do I run faster?
[126:03.80]You have to aim your gun down, then you move faster.
[126:11.42]You do?
[126:11.78]I think so.
[126:14.10]If you have it up and aiming, you move slower.
[126:15.88]You have to have your hands down at your side.
[126:17.42]Hey, we're going this way.
[126:22.97]Okay.
[126:33.45]We look like fucking assholes right now, by the way.

[128:53.41]Right here?
[129:05.26]Hold on.
[129:19.05]They're breathing pretty heavy over there.
[129:20.65]I don't know, I gotta... How do you aim this?
[129:23.72]Just put it on like Cologne, right?
[129:40.62]Let's move.
[129:40.98]Is it down here?
[129:44.13]Yeah.
[129:47.13]I'll tell you something.
[129:48.65]I will tell you.
[129:49.53]It is so sweaty in my visor right now.
[129:53.35]It's like I have goggles on and I'm underwater.
[129:55.52]I just want to make sure that you're aware of that.

[130:33.87]Behind you, behind you, watch out!
[130:48.19]Yeah, okay, you know when you go into a pool that... Stop doing that!

[130:58.03]Yeah?
[130:58.65]And then when you get out of that pool, all you see is the haze surrounding everything, the lights all have rainbows on them and shit?
[131:04.64]You're saying you're the kid that shit in the pool?
[131:07.78]Precisely, pretty much.
[131:14.08]Like, when you go underwater in a public pool and you open your eyes, shit is flowing into your eyes.
[131:19.18]It's clean shit.
[131:20.00]It's been cleaned.
[131:20.68]Hey.

[135:15.30]Let's go.
[135:15.58]Let's go.
[135:41.28]There may have been a misunderstanding.
[135:42.72]A player has left the game.
[135:54.77]He was just trying to help.
[136:04.90]He was trying to help.
[136:07.38]He was a good guy.
[136:10.44]And you just fucking blew him away.
[136:12.77]He came up behind us.
[136:16.33]Yeah, but he's... Okay, zombies don't talk.
[136:19.39]Where am I?

[138:58.96]Okay, I'm done.
[139:00.46]I'm out of here.
[139:02.34]I'm done.
[139:03.13]You can't...
[139:13.23]All right, let's get this show on the road.
[139:14.85]Day four of the season.
[139:15.82]No, you just left the game.
[139:17.04]Oh, my God.
[139:17.56]Let's get ready.
[139:18.90]Let's get ready.
[139:19.50]Let's go.
[139:19.98]Let's go.
[139:20.22]All right, let's get ready.
[139:21.70]Okay, what do we have to do?
[139:22.74]What time is it?
[139:23.48]All right, that's right.
[139:24.12]I go over here.
[139:24.64]I just clocked in.
[139:26.30]I clocked it up.
[139:26.84]I was like fucking goofball clown stream.
[139:28.84]There it is.
[139:29.24]Okay, here we go.
[139:30.76]Let's go over here.
[139:31.46]Hey, I pick up the sniper rifle.
[139:33.58]That's what I do typically on the first day.
[139:35.28]I, you know, grab two of these.
[139:38.84]Well, let me load that one.
[139:40.86]Okay, where are those sights?
[139:42.88]You know where the sights are?
[139:43.88]Up here, I think.
[139:45.00]I don't know how to put them on.
[139:46.47]I think they go like this somehow.
[139:49.49]But they never actually attach.
[139:50.71]I think it's for a different gun.
[139:53.87]Because they keep saying, whoops.
[139:54.73]There's no way.
[139:55.87]That's the only sniper rifle.
[139:57.41]Why would, like, this big scope isn't going to go on here?
[140:00.47]They keep saying, whoops.
[140:08.72]I just put that into my head.
[140:11.64]I just, like, video-dromed that into my head.
[140:13.58]Maybe we should do the tutorial.
[140:14.92]Maybe we should have done the tutorial.
[140:18.68]Hey, hold on.
[140:19.30]Hey, hey, look at me.

[144:04.59]You can explain it.
[144:06.12]I don't remember what is Jet Island.
[144:08.26]The way you go really fast and you have those tethers?
[144:11.10]You said that you were going to throw up if we played that?
[144:13.38]Oh no, that was Gunhaven.
[144:14.66]I said I would vomit over Gunhaven.
[144:16.78]I don't know what Jet Island is.
[144:18.70]Guys, he doesn't even know what Jet Island is.
[144:20.08]He can't even play Gunhaven?
[144:23.79]Alright, you want to do PvP?
[144:27.25]PvP...
[144:28.35]Outside of here, though.
[144:29.37]No bullshit.
[144:29.87]You only get one gun.
[144:31.35]No, no, no.
[144:31.77]Get all those guns.
[144:32.97]You got a ton of guns on you.
[144:35.39]Go out that door, and I'll go out this door, and, like, inside the fenced area.
[144:39.66]What do you mean?
[144:41.20]What's the fenced area?
[144:42.88]Like, right outside.
[144:43.60]This whole area is fenced in.
[144:45.70]So you're talking about, like, out of this room.
[144:47.86]No, no, no.
[144:48.40]Get back in here.
[144:49.04]I want to examine your shit.
[144:50.22]Come here.
[144:51.88]Let me see.
[144:52.24]In case you have a large...
[144:55.89]Super-sized Uzi.
[144:57.34]You have a regular Uzi.
[144:59.30]Okay, is that all you have?
[145:00.00]That's it.
[145:01.62]Okay.
[145:02.80]I am going with... I have a handgun in my pocket.
[145:04.92]Okay, I'm going to go with handgun.
[145:07.96]That was a very stupid way to pick that up.
[145:12.71]Gun safety.
[145:17.71]Okay.
[145:18.89]Gun.
[145:20.95]I'm also going to go... Are we allowed to have first aid?
[145:24.07]No.
[145:25.65]Okay, fine.
[145:27.93]Oops.
[145:28.19]What are you doing?
[145:48.76]Nevermind.
[145:55.23]All right.
[145:55.57]I'm going with this.
[145:58.74]This speaks to me.
[146:03.28]This is all I need.
[146:08.26]Okay.
[146:09.49]I'm going out there.
[146:11.05]So we're going to do like, are we doing a 10 paces thing and then we'll turn around and let go?
[146:14.47]No, we're just, as soon as you're out here, if we see each other.
[146:16.97]Okay.
[146:18.27]So right out like this door here, you mean like out here?
[146:20.55]No, the other door.
[146:21.94]Okay.
[146:22.26]So I'm going, you ready?
[146:29.01]You're not doing it right!
[146:31.93]You don't understand.
[146:34.51]No, you don't understand.
[146:36.23]I don't want to hit the wall.
[146:38.41]I'm trying to associate myself so I don't hit the wall.
[146:42.99]Go outside!
[146:43.77]I'm just tangled!
[146:45.83]God dammit.
[146:47.99]Hold on, I'm just tangled up here.
[146:54.34]Alright, let's go.
[146:54.92]You ready?
[147:46.83]What?
[147:47.69]Oh shit!
[147:52.20]It's me.
[147:52.58]Alright, best two out of three.
[147:54.60]Handguns only.
[147:55.34]No, like, no rapid fire bullshit.
[147:57.17]We're talking about weapons that were, like, before, like, the 1900s.
[147:59.19]You know what I'm saying?
[147:59.97]Only single-shot handguns.
[148:02.11]Yeah, weapons that were, like, used in the Civil War.
[148:06.31]Only single-shot handguns.
[148:07.63]Weapons that were created back in the 1930s.
[148:09.80]None of this bullshit.
[148:14.48]None of this, like, rat-tat-tat bullshit.
[148:18.80]We're talking shotgun, pistol.
[148:22.00]I'm just, it's pistol time.
[148:32.75]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[148:34.31]Back in the 1950s, they didn't have flashlights on their guns.
[148:36.87]Fine, you want to pull that?
[148:46.01]You only get one handgun, by the way.
[148:49.14]One handgun, one shotgun, I'm ready.
[148:51.04]I'm turning to yell at that to you for some reason.
[148:54.60]Hey, can you hear me?
[148:55.94]The signal is weak.
[148:56.74]I had a hard time during my last run, so I left some things undone.
[149:01.28]The first thing you have to do is to top up the generator with gasoline, or we won't be able to communicate anymore.
[149:07.03]I will be on your map at gas station where you can find some.
[149:11.05]You can do it.
[149:13.37]I'm outside.
[149:14.21]I'm ready.
[149:14.99]Wait, wait, don't shoot, don't shoot.
[149:15.83]I'm just making sure you're ready.
[149:21.65]Are you ready?
[149:22.69]I'm ready.
[149:29.74]I'm coming.
[149:33.20]Just trying to get my footing here.
[149:39.53]Coming!
[150:03.69]What?
[150:04.67]I didn't do this.
[150:06.01]I didn't do this.
[150:11.81]Sitting there, entrenched.
[150:16.58]I'm trying to bait you.
[150:18.18]I've got the flashlight bouncing.
[150:20.84]Best two out of three.
[150:24.14]Just get a handgun.
[150:24.79]No shotguns.
[150:25.29]Oh, no.
[150:25.55]You know what?
[150:26.05]Fucking handguns only.
[150:28.03]Only handguns.
[150:28.51]No slappers.
[150:29.59]No, no.
[150:33.52]Okay, hold on a minute here.
[150:34.79]Let me go... Okay.
[150:39.39]Just making sure it works.
[150:46.21]Hey, can you hear me?
[150:47.51]The signal is weak.
[150:48.31]I had a hard time during my last run, so I left some things undone.
[150:52.87]The first thing you have to do is to top up the generator with gasoline, or we won't be able to communicate anymore.
[150:59.38]I will pin on your map a gas station where you can find some.
[151:02.28]You can do it.
[151:12.66]You're gonna die!
[151:13.62]I'm right behind you!
[151:16.25]Fucking asshole.
[152:14.28]Bleh!
[152:40.99]What did I just drop the gun for?
[152:45.16]I mean, I still have my gun.
[152:46.40]My gun is just still with me.
[153:02.11]Oh, you fucking liar.
[153:03.37]You liar post.
[153:04.75]Post bullshit.
[153:05.79]Post bullshit.
[153:08.29]Got him.
[153:13.83]That was actually fun.
[153:14.99]Like, I didn't want to play the PvP military VR games because it seemed... What, Pavlov?
[153:24.09]Yeah.
[153:25.65]What do you got against Pavlov?
[153:27.21]Nothing now that we've had the 1v1.
[153:29.71]We were going to play Pavlov.
[153:34.92]This is a mess underneath me.
[153:36.12]Alright, last one.
[153:37.20]Sniper rifles only.
[153:52.92]I need the gun.
[153:54.21]We gotta count to like 30 seconds, by the way.
[154:03.13]Okay, you ready?
[154:59.92]What?
[155:00.72]I... How?
[155:03.76]How are you doing that?
[155:06.51]What?
[155:12.11]How did you even... I don't even know where you were.
[155:13.57]I flanked you.
[155:19.64]Alright.
[155:22.20]This game's fun.
[155:25.30]We were like, we were doing a lot of shit talking at this tutorial.
[155:29.70]Because the tutorial isn't good.
[155:32.61]Everything else... This is really fun, though.
[155:35.77]I could see, like, getting two, uh, possibly three people in here, and the third person, like, kind of knows what they're doing, is, like, trying to give, like, some advice.
[155:44.52]And, like, he's playing with three people, and that's kind of fun, I think.
[155:56.41]Alright, I'm going to get some water.
[155:57.81]You want to take like a two minute break?
[156:00.11]Uh, sure.
[156:00.99]Just to get out of the headset, get some water.
[156:03.17]Drunken bar fight or... Drunken bar fight is next.
[156:06.79]Or bust next.
[156:08.46]How long have we been going?
[156:10.08]Um, that's a good question.
[156:10.90]Let's find out.
[156:13.18]Oh, just about two and a half hours.
[156:21.60]We'll do Drunken Bar Fight, and then from Drunken Bar Fight, we'll go to Desert Bus.
[156:31.24]Okay.
[156:32.62]So go grab yourself a water, and we'll return.
[156:37.44]I'm going to hydrate up.
[156:40.70]Don't you need to get drunk for that?
[156:44.60]Theoretically, no.
[156:47.12]I've been drunk this whole time.
[156:48.24]Alright, be right back.
[160:31.31]hello we are just waiting for stir and then we can continue with the drunken bar fight as we'll just get it open now oh you're here okay yep now let's figure out how we jump into this as a team
[160:59.18]I missed, uh, I missed massive bits, did I?
[161:01.52]Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see.
[161:15.43]Yeah, yeah, we did.
[161:17.37]Uh, Bloody Doctor.
[161:19.93]Thank you, Bloody, if you're Bloody Doctor, if you're still here.
[161:21.64]That is, uh, $50, 5,000 bits from Bloody Doctor.
[161:23.56]Thank you so much.
[161:30.81]Sorry I missed it.
[161:31.58]I was immersed in virtual reality.
[161:37.68]But they said you should mute, stir on Discord, and use the in-game voice.
[161:40.86]It's more immersive.
[161:46.42]But it's not as crisp.
[161:48.89]Yeah, we're all about crispness here.
[161:50.29]You're not as crispy.
[161:53.69]Oh, by the way, I just burped and tasted food, so I'm going to tell you a little story about a dream I had last night.
[161:57.61]You're going to like this one.
[161:59.76]So you're aware of the Chef Gordon Ramsay, right?
[162:02.91]Um, yes.
[162:04.47]So I had a dream that I went to one of his Kitchen Nightmares restaurants.
[162:09.63]With him.
[162:10.87]Me, Kim, and Gordon Ramsay went to one of his kitchen nightmares.
[162:15.15]I'm coming back to check on it.
[162:17.66]You know how he does that sometimes?
[162:18.64]I was there for some reason.
[162:19.54]I don't know why.
[162:20.92]So we sit down at the table.
[162:23.68]We try a bunch of the food.
[162:24.74]He's ordering a bunch of shit.
[162:26.68]And me and Kim are like, oh, this is delicious.
[162:28.39]Yeah, this is great.
[162:29.15]He's like, what do you think about that?
[162:29.97]Isn't that much more tender?
[162:31.31]We're like, yeah, it's great.
[162:32.75]So anyways, we eat like, I don't know, $100 worth of food.
[162:35.73]And the check comes.
[162:37.65]And I was having, like, this in-dream panic of, do I have to pick up this check?
[162:43.96]And Gordon Ramsay was, like, kind of looking at it.
[162:45.90]I was looking at it.
[162:47.28]I was like, is the show paying for this?
[162:49.80]I didn't say that.
[162:51.48]And, like, I kind of got up and was moving around.
[162:53.24]This check, like, that check is laying on the table and neither one of us are touching it.
[162:58.37]And then I woke up panicking.
[163:01.85]It could be worse.
[163:02.73]It could have been way worse, yeah.
[163:03.75]But, like, it was weird.
[163:07.34]It was an actual dream.
[163:09.36]I had a dream recently that was, I told my stream, that me and Donald Trump were laying in bed together staring at the ceiling and he was telling me how bad he felt.
[163:18.47]And I was just listening to him.
[163:21.11]And I felt bad for him.
[163:22.37]And then I woke up.
[163:23.01]How bad he felt?
[163:24.53]Yeah.
[163:24.97]He was like, people really don't like me anymore.
[163:26.81]It was really weird.
[163:29.41]Scott, let me tell you.
[163:31.42]I don't know what it is about people.
[163:33.12]They don't like me.
[163:33.92]I don't know why.
[163:37.51]All right.
[163:37.85]Are you inviting me?
[163:39.35]Yeah.
[163:40.85]Okay.
[163:41.11]I just clicked a, hey, German, meet me at the bar.
[163:46.15]You know, I really wish you'd make TF2 videos again.
[163:50.82]Really, I would love it.
[163:52.48]All right.
[163:53.84]That's the first thing he said.
[163:56.96]Hold on.
[163:58.60]I can't hear you.
[163:59.20]Don't talk.
[163:59.64]Oh, but hold on.
[164:00.16]There's a guy that drives.
[164:00.96]Yeah, there's a guy that drives by the house like 15 times a day going like 40, 50 miles per highway in a goddamn neighborhood.
[164:08.73]Just making an appearance on every stream.
[164:14.85]Alright, hold on.
[164:17.49]Why are you doing this to me, headset?
[164:18.85]Alright, one more drink of my officially not-sponsored Canada Dry ginger ale.
[164:27.73]And I mean that for real.
[164:28.75]It's not... Okay.
[164:33.07]Can you see me?
[164:34.55]You guys can't see anything.
[164:35.35]Why?
[164:37.96]Oh, that's why.
[164:52.49]Ginger ale isn't hydration.
[164:53.63]There's plenty of water in that.
[164:57.23]Ginger ale's just like, when you drink ginger ale, it instantly forms gas that shoots out of your system.
[165:04.45]It's the worst soft drink.
[165:06.11]I love it, though.
[165:07.79]All right, ready?
[165:08.65]What's new?
[165:09.25]Waiting for you at the bar.
[165:10.55]Said you'd be here.
[165:11.29]I have trouble in this.
[165:13.13]Looking at my watch.
[165:13.93]Said you'd be here.
[165:14.67]I'm coming.
[165:31.13]Okay, so, where you at?
[165:36.15]Hold on, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, nobody move.
[165:40.76]Okay, now you can move.
[165:47.44]Hey, Jerva, meet at the bar.
[165:51.95]How do I do that?
[165:53.81]Meet at the bar.
[165:58.25]How do you have two hours in this game?
[166:01.32]That's how long I've been waiting for you.
[166:02.86]Oh, you've already played this?
[166:05.49]No.
[166:06.15]I've been sitting here waiting at the bar.
[166:07.79]It says you have 1.8 hours.
[166:09.17]Alright, how do I accept your invite?
[166:12.13]I don't know.
[166:19.29]No, this is wrong.
[166:25.47]Meet me at the bar.
[166:27.97]Invited you to play Drunken Bar Fight.
[166:29.42]I pressed the button.
[166:32.80]I pressed the button.
[166:34.46]Help me.
[166:34.76]I don't know.
[166:41.00]That's all I can do.
[166:42.42]Invite you.
[166:43.14]Messages on top.
[166:45.40]Top right, you see messages.
[166:51.11]Show keyboard.
[166:56.79]Drunken bar fight.
[167:00.93]I don't have anything from you.
[167:01.94]How do I...
[167:03.61]I have six things for you.
[167:09.11]No, I don't want to join Italics' RimWorld stream.
[167:12.59]All right, I'm going.
[167:16.67]Play a game.
[167:32.02]I'm trying.
[167:33.27]I promise I'm trying.
[167:35.01]Did you go offline?
[167:35.51]I believe you.
[167:36.59]No, I'm in the bar.
[167:41.47]You accepted an invitation.
[167:43.93]Okay.
[167:47.45]What the fuck is happening?
[167:50.95]Are we here?
[167:52.73]Are you in there?
[167:54.34]Are you in the bar?
[167:56.14]I got a loading screen.
[168:08.29]There you are.
[168:09.37]That's you?
[168:10.85]I don't know which one is you.
[168:15.35]I'm the one sitting at the laptop.
[168:21.38]Hey, behind you.
[168:27.82]Anyone got anything that'll wake me up?
[168:29.80]Okay, you're sitting over here.
[168:31.44]That's you.
[168:31.82]I'm sitting at the laptop.
[168:37.57]Trying to start a fight?
[168:41.02]Something fucking weird is happening.
[168:43.54]What?
[168:43.74]Why?
[168:44.72]Okay.
[168:45.20]Okay!
[168:49.02]What's going on with my room here?
[168:50.36]What's with my hands?
[168:56.26]Come on!
[168:58.15]This is such a fucking YouTuber game.
[169:00.99]It really is.
[169:01.51]It's not like one-to-one for some reason for me.
[169:08.08]Not the napkin dispenser.
[169:11.81]Get up!
[169:17.67]The bartender won't serve you down there.
[169:19.71]Maybe next time you should pick yourself up.
[169:21.85]Who's this guy?
[169:27.35]Happy New Year!
[169:29.48]Happy New Year!
[169:31.43]That was fun.
[169:32.12]We did it.
[169:33.38]That was it.
[169:37.28]You can't just immediately start fights.
[169:42.37]He doesn't even know you're doing it.
[169:43.95]Alright, alright, alright.
[169:45.13]Where are you?
[169:46.47]Are you trying to stick his head in?
[170:12.03]I'm up.
[170:13.23]Oh, he's part of the fight.
[170:22.33]Oh, tips.
[170:22.87]Oh, I'll take these bits.
[170:51.89]We're taking out the whole bar.
[171:05.44]Get everybody involved.
[171:06.92]Get everyone involved.
[171:10.22]Do we lose?
[171:12.98]All right, strategy.
[171:14.32]Strategy, strategy.
[171:15.28]See, see, we got to start strong because we got to get everybody before the cops show up.
[171:18.89]Okay, so how do you want to do this?
[171:22.85]Get the weapons in the right place.
[171:27.65]Everything's a weapon.
[171:30.67]This guy's a walking king.
[171:34.45]I'm going in.
[171:35.23]I'm going Indiana Jones style.
[171:37.39]You ready?
[171:38.13]Oh my god.
[171:40.13]Hit him.
[171:42.67]Oh!
[172:25.77]Also, there's another bar.
[172:27.24]I don't know how to leave this one though.
[172:29.32]No, I didn't mean to do that!
[172:30.18]Where'd you get the whip?
[172:31.88]Oh.
[172:32.06]This is my fantasy.
[172:52.67]Alright, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[172:57.45]You flew across the whole screen for me.
[173:00.97]Get up, get up.
[173:01.91]Help me.
[173:03.91]Help me!
[173:04.49]Pick me up!
[173:05.95]What?
[173:07.47]Wow.
[173:11.83]This is crap.
[173:12.67]What the fuck did we just see?
[173:14.19]Oh, those TV posts.
[173:15.13]Okay.
[173:15.89]Alright, this guy's gotta go.
[173:17.59]What did I just do?
[173:19.59]Oh, Jerma.
[173:21.05]Hold on.
[173:21.35]Hold on.
[173:21.83]Emergency.
[173:25.53]I left my kids at home so I can come out and get rowdy.
[173:28.16]I got an idea.
[173:29.10]Get a bunch of weapons up there.
[173:31.92]Look at me.
[173:32.82]I want to see if this looks... I was lifting my legs with my own guitar.
[173:38.92]Are you going to sit on... That's so, so fucking stupid.
[173:46.76]I'm going to kick you.
[174:04.58]My book broke.
[174:07.14]All right, we gotta, hold on.
[174:11.39]Whose phone is this?
[174:18.69]Oh, no, no, no, no, I don't wanna do that.
[174:20.95]Here, open your mouth.
[174:22.37]No, no, no, no, you, you.
[174:27.43]Oh, I'm drunk.
[174:29.41]Hey, open up, bro!
[174:35.68]Open up, bro.
[174:39.12]Come on, this is a devil's cocktail.
[174:41.75]I call this one.
[174:42.73]The bartender won't serve you down there.
[174:44.77]Maybe next time you should pick yourself up.
[174:49.29]Come on, bro.
[174:50.29]Yeah, it's cherry sauce, vodka, and a Guinness.
[174:58.39]I don't know how to go to the other bar.
[175:00.33]How the hell do we do anything?
[175:01.71]Just walk out the door.
[175:03.47]I couldn't walk all the way there.
[175:06.14]All right, let's go.
[175:07.00]Jager bombs incoming.
[175:08.58]Let's go.
[175:09.80]I'm done.
[175:10.34]I'm on my way.
[175:11.68]I can't.
[175:12.92]You get stuck here.
[175:16.00]Get out of here.
[175:18.28]Get out of here.
[175:19.56]Did he just drop kick me?
[175:21.96]I think he did.

[175:48.84]That guy right there?
[175:50.08]That fucking piece of shit, what'd he do?
[175:53.82]Did he talk shit to you?
[175:56.31]He said I look like Mickey Mouse.
[175:58.45]Aw, man, bro.
[175:59.67]I'll just, wait, hold on.

[176:14.86]My buddy over there, he looks like a fucking cartoon character.
[176:18.09]Is that what you said?
[176:20.59]Mickey Mouse.
[176:21.93]Kind of like that fucking Mickey Mouse fucking necklace you got on.
[176:56.17]This is like 0.1% of GTA if it was in VR.
[176:58.37]Dude, you should have seen you going like this, man.
[177:02.34]That is fucking hilarious.
[177:07.68]That is my fucking laptop.
[177:09.70]Alright, can we get out of this bar?
[177:48.10]I just left this girl's house.
[177:49.74]You can never leave.
[177:50.89]Was that fucked up?
[177:52.21]21 girls for my 21st.
[177:52.93]You know what I'm saying, bro?
[177:54.43]All right.
[177:58.15]My man bun took about a month to get just right.
[178:05.99]Why did you do that?
[178:07.43]I didn't do anything.
[178:09.06]Why are you fighting me?
[178:29.91]The bartender won't serve you down there.
[178:31.95]Maybe next time you should pick yourself up.
[178:33.71]All right, all right.
[178:34.69]Exit menu.
[178:35.35]Hit menu, hit menu.
[178:36.85]I don't know how.
[178:37.87]Oh.
[178:38.20]Just hit menu to get out of this bar.
[178:42.16]All right, let's go to another bar.
[178:43.20]What is the menu?
[178:44.94]It's top right button on the vibe.
[178:48.92]Okay.
[178:49.08]It's trigger to play again.
[178:50.40]Okay, no, I left.
[178:51.64]Are we together?
[178:52.48]No, I can invite you to the other bar.
[178:55.56]I think there's only two.
[178:56.90]Let's go to the other bar.
[178:58.02]I'm going to fucking puke.
[179:01.58]Oh, no, there's like a... Okay, hold on, hold on.
[179:09.18]If I get KO'd, you have to pick yourself up.
[179:11.20]Can you go in the elevator?
[179:13.09]Oh, shit, you can go in the goddamn elevator.
[179:16.49]I don't see you online to invite me anymore.
[179:19.05]Oh, no.
[179:20.89]Uh, there's a bar up top, too, man.
[179:23.03]Yeah, that's where I am right now.
[179:24.10]I'm at the spy party.
[179:25.32]Are you here?
[179:27.30]Should I invite you?
[179:27.72]No, because we have to actually join each other.
[179:29.88]How did you join off the invite?
[179:32.22]I just went to the... This is going to be a problem here.

[179:44.13]Hey, Jerma, meet me at the bar.
[179:47.23]Are you coming to me?
[179:47.85]I sent you an invite.
[179:50.01]Okay, I'm coming to you.
[179:54.32]When you see this shit, you're going to be...
[179:57.29]You're gonna be a little, uh, you're gonna be a little shocked at what you see.
[180:01.31]How are the cops gonna get up here?
[180:04.33]I don't know.
[180:06.31]Oh, are you... Did I join you?
[180:08.41]I don't think so.
[180:10.67]I don't see you.
[180:11.11]Accepted an invitation.
[180:13.67]Maybe I have to leave?
[180:19.71]You accepted an invitation to play Drunken Bar Fight.
[180:21.63]Okay.
[180:22.29]So... Meet me at the bar.
[180:29.55]I might have to leave.
[180:31.29]Yeah, I gotta be, like, in the main venue.
[180:32.77]What is this?
[180:34.57]Oh.
[180:34.71]Okay, I think it just said yes.
[180:36.23]Okay, I have, like, a phone.
[180:37.48]Wait, let me just get the fuck out of here.
[180:43.36]How do...

[181:04.71]All right.
[181:04.97]It loaded me in finally.
[181:05.81]All right.
[181:06.91]I'm behind you.
[181:09.03]Watch out.
[181:09.49]I'm going to use my new technique.
[181:10.85]You got a new technique?
[181:12.31]You okay?
[181:18.40]I once cured the shingles and then I realized I could make more money.
[181:22.92]You want a drink?
[181:32.52]This is the most uncomfortable I've done in my life.
[181:35.04]You want some?
[181:35.46]Ow.
[181:35.62]That's my wall.
[181:36.24]Go over here.
[181:36.68]Cheers.
[181:36.92]Can you pop that open?
[181:40.01]No.

[182:01.98]What?
[182:07.99]I can't pick myself up.
[182:09.95]How do you pick yourself up?
[182:13.55]The bartender won't serve you down there.
[182:15.61]Maybe next time you should pick yourself up.
[182:17.11]You're still alive.
[182:18.33]You're still fine.
[182:21.83]Is that a firecracker?
[182:23.95]Did you shoot a Roman candle?
[182:26.41]There's like

[183:09.78]Come here for a second.
[183:11.36]Hold on, is this... Sorry.
[183:15.36]I didn't mean to.
[183:16.34]Look, I'm drunk.
[183:17.26]I want to do something.
[183:18.80]Oh my god.
[183:19.90]Come over here.
[183:22.47]Come over here and put your hand here.
[183:24.07]You know what I mean?
[183:25.29]Put your hand here.

[184:02.38]Nobody else was even remotely involved.
[184:05.48]No one is bothered.
[184:06.88]There's two assholes playing with toys over here and killing each other.
[184:10.23]Alright, okay.
[184:10.63]Do they have pictures?
[184:34.33]How does this work?
[184:39.49]That wasn't very good.
[184:40.99]Uh, excuse me.
[184:45.54]I'm smoking.
[184:46.54]Let's go.
[184:46.82]Come over this way.
[184:52.26]Ugh.
[184:54.90]Nobody's talking anymore.
[184:55.84]This is my sister's wedding.
[184:57.48]I give it two years.
[184:59.84]No, no, no.
[185:00.42]Wait.
[185:00.62]Wait.
[185:00.82]You wait.
[185:02.82]I'm waiting.
[185:03.32]I'm just joining the conversation with my vase that I brought... You're trying to, like, feed Jeff Bezos.
[185:18.31]This is fucking terrifying.
[185:21.37]It's like up his nose.
[185:22.19]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[185:24.15]I want to see if I can balance it.
[185:31.46]Daniel?
[185:31.62]Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's he doing?
[185:35.00]Wait, give me the wine.
[185:38.49]Oops.
[185:43.61]Who are we feeding?
[185:45.77]All right, he's a little bit boozed up.
[186:11.88]Hey, you enjoying the wedding?
[186:13.22]You guys enjoying the wedding?
[186:14.26]Yeah, I love this couple.
[186:15.66]They're so fucking friendly.
[186:17.34]My favorite thing, if you've had the wine yet, it's fantastic.
[186:20.74]Hey, if you like the three stooges.
[186:22.52]Oh, come on.
[186:23.18]Damn it.
[186:24.50]Hey, my favorite.
[186:26.62]Maybe next time you should pick yourself up.
[186:32.07]Come on.
[186:33.19]Why can't we just sit here for an hour and behave?
[186:35.17]All right, here's the deal.
[186:36.95]You ready for the game?
[186:39.59]Where are you?
[186:41.88]The game is, you have to... Let go of that.
[186:48.88]No!
[186:50.02]Stop it!
[186:50.58]I was just doing fireworks for the party!
[186:52.56]No, you're gonna piss people off.
[186:54.55]I'm down?
[186:55.25]I got you, I got you.
[186:58.19]Okay.
[186:58.85]Alright, the goal is... Stand in the... The fuck?
[187:05.67]Alright, will you settle down, Kylo Ren?
[187:15.93]Get the fuck away from me.
[187:32.09]It's a crab!
[187:32.83]I'm going for your legs!
[187:35.90]I'm like the kid in the party.
[187:42.78]Yeah, you're like the annoying little shit.
[187:46.27]That's running around and bumping into people.
[187:48.15]You just punched that lady.
[187:57.57]I wonder, can they punch me when I'm down here?
[187:59.41]I'm just chapped right now.
[188:04.13]They just keep punching this lady in the face.
[188:07.24]I'm winning this fight.
[188:11.92]This is bizarre.
[188:17.14]Animals, you know what I'm saying?
[188:43.22]Get me!
[188:43.54]Get me!
[188:43.82]Get me up!

[188:52.69]Oh.
[188:54.37]Okay.
[188:54.73]Uh.
[188:55.29]How do you win?
[188:56.11]I just got another follower.
[188:57.49]Do you win?
[188:58.29]I don't think you win.
[189:00.25]Wait.
[189:00.45]Hold on a second.
[189:01.15]Don't hurt anybody.
[189:01.85]Just give me move people.
[189:05.38]I want to throw someone off the roof.
[189:07.32]Ow!
[189:07.46]Ow!
[189:19.14]I'm down, I'm down.
[189:21.88]I'm down, lift me up!
[189:29.27]What are you doing?
[189:31.25]I thought you of all people would appreciate a double middle finger.
[189:34.25]Oh, that's what you were doing?
[189:35.85]Yeah.
[189:36.09]Hey.
[189:41.22]What do you got to say about these?
[189:55.91]Wait, wait, wait, stop.
[190:07.47]Ow.
[190:08.91]I hope the DJ plays Goodbye Horses.
[190:11.15]That's my favorite song to dance to.
[190:14.15]Hey.
[190:15.65]Hey.
[190:16.99]Excuse me.
[190:17.87]Hey.
[190:18.89]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[190:25.52]He tried to run off the rim.
[190:30.09]Hey, hey, hey.
[190:31.81]I'm down.
[190:32.37]Help.
[190:32.59]Get me.
[190:32.87]Nice.
[190:54.16]I can get myself up?
[190:56.98]Why can I not take a single punch to the face?
[190:58.88]All right, that's it.
[191:02.55]All right, come over here.
[191:04.75]Come with me.
[191:05.41]Don't hurt anybody.
[191:05.93]Get over here.
[191:07.73]Okay, here's the deal.
[191:09.39]I'm going to support his body.
[191:12.17]You support his legs.
[191:14.05]We're going to one, two, three, throw him over the edge.
[191:17.48]Come on, stay there.
[191:21.40]Okay, so you know like the practical joke where you kneel behind him?
[191:24.44]Yeah, yeah.
[191:25.45]You ready?
[191:26.01]Ready?
[191:26.53]Here, he's gonna come up.
[191:27.93]Lift his legs up.
[191:30.17]It's not grabbing him.
[192:00.55]So, uh, you know there's a Halloween version of this game too, right?
[192:04.66]I'm sure it changed the game dramatically.
[192:09.40]Bitcoin is gonna be 300k in a month.
[192:12.97]I piss 300k daily.
[192:14.39]My face is a couch!
[192:15.83]I'm supposed to win!
[192:32.85]Is that Gilbert Godfrey?
[192:34.01]Is that Dry Bear?
[192:36.36]It does sound like Godfrey.
[192:38.40]Gilbert Godfrey.
[192:39.96]I got him!
[192:40.92]I got him!
[192:41.66]No!
[192:41.98]What, you got him?
[192:44.10]He almost went off.
[192:58.93]It's really like this...
[193:01.06]All right, I'll take two more of these, please.
[193:09.52]This guy's hanging on for his life.
[193:11.22]I'm done.
[193:19.01]I'm dead.
[193:19.79]I'm dead.
[193:21.25]I died.
[193:22.03]I fucking can't, man.
[193:27.11]It's just...
[193:30.03]It's just the same shit over and over again, but it's... Yeah, so how about that desert buzz?
[193:34.37]I know, how about desert buzz, huh?
[193:40.01]Hey, actually, you know what?
[193:41.11]We need to do the 1v1.
[193:43.75]1v1 here?
[193:44.83]Yeah.
[193:45.39]Alright, fine.
[193:45.95]It's all about the intimidation factor, guys.

[194:36.61]Big mistake!
[194:37.07]I'm down?
[195:09.73]Okay, I have a headache.
[195:11.37]Yeah, I do too.
[195:13.23]I have a fucking bad headache.
[195:15.73]Alright, we gotta get everybody.
[195:17.63]You ready?
[195:19.31]Oh, oh, that- I have a headache means we're getting everybody.
[195:21.52]Well then we should be throwing bombs!
[195:22.64]Alright, stop, stop, stop, stop, wait, stop, slow down, slow down.
[195:26.02]We gotta get the- slow down.
[195:29.96]Easy.

[195:37.25]No, these are the bombs.
[195:39.89]Make sure they're not, like, shaky toys.
[195:41.19]I'm sure.
[195:41.49]Okay.
[195:41.69]Ready?
[195:42.03]Oh, what's the fuse time?
[195:43.17]Oh, God.
[195:43.50]I'm sneezing in them.
[195:44.16]I'm allergic.
[195:44.70]I can't even believe you survived until 40.
[196:08.32]I have this tramp stamp of a tiger.
[196:10.20]It's so mystical.
[196:16.10]I once cured the shingles, and then I realized I could make more money.
[196:18.86]What?
[196:19.22]I just fell over?
[196:39.74]This really quickly went from bar fight to acts of terrorism.
[196:53.91]I only drink at rooftop bars, even if it's- Why'd my hand switch?
[196:57.52]My nice freedom's standing on top of you.
[197:05.53]Shh, quiet.
[197:08.22]I snuck up here and sabotaged this place since they're stealing all the customers from my bar.
[197:13.18]I can't be positive.
[197:16.08]I think she was proud.
[197:37.01]God damn it.
[197:38.45]What are you doing?
[197:39.45]I'm fucking sitting down, man.
[197:40.99]I'm going to fucking pass out.
[197:44.01]Looking up at your face.
[197:44.91]It's so funny.
[197:52.42]I just got another follower on Insta.
[197:55.78]It's not like this is not... I don't know.
[197:57.94]Something's... Okay, where am I?
[198:00.22]Guys, I just understand something.
[198:02.94]I didn't do this.
[198:05.68]This was another reason why I was laughing.
[198:09.89]What am I doing on your screen?
[198:12.25]Your arms are crossed like this.
[198:14.25]They shouldn't be.
[198:14.95]Are you holding the wrong controller?
[198:18.91]No, I got the straps on.
[198:20.67]There's no way that my hands came out of the straps, through the other straps.
[198:29.00]No way.
[198:33.48]That could not have happened, right?
[198:34.68]There's no way on the ground.
[198:39.02]I don't know, that's impossible.
[198:40.16]Nope, I'm in the wedding part.
[198:43.22]I'm the father of the, yes.
[198:57.11]What the fuck is he doing?
[198:57.87]If you're not ashamed of your own body, then there's something wrong with you.

[199:29.49]Are you still alive?
[199:58.35]The bartender won't serve you down there.
[200:00.65]Maybe next time you should pick yourself up.
[200:05.04]My daddy's on Bitcoin.
[200:06.30]It's gotta be worth $300,000 in about two months.
[200:10.04]Alright, how do we get out of here?
[200:11.30]How do we get out?
[200:12.54]Oh my god.

[202:27.21]I'm not doing that.
[202:34.55]What?

[206:08.27]I'm so bad.
[206:19.15]What the fuck?
[206:21.49]Give me this whole toaster.
[206:22.61]Oh shit.
[207:03.06]That's the sound you want to hear in VR.
[207:06.68]Where are you?
[207:07.53]I can't get out of here.
[207:11.47]I can't get out, guys.

[208:21.88]I left.
[208:22.22]Okay.
[208:29.76]Totally wasted.
[208:34.44]I think we all hear voices in our heads sometimes.
[208:43.01]Subverting expectations!
[208:45.79]You again?
[208:47.41]You're not going to embarrass me again?

[209:17.24]Yeah, let's get on the bus.
[209:18.62]Yeah, let's get on the bus.
[209:20.32]I could use a relaxing eight-hour drive to soothe my headache.
[209:27.82]I only drink at rooftop bars, even if it's the dead of winter.
[210:03.86]Okay.
[210:05.66]Uh, you want to take care of... What?
[210:13.26]You ready to get on a bus?
[210:16.14]Yeah, I'm launching it.
[210:17.28]Alright, how do I do it from my, like, home studio?
[210:23.12]I don't know.
[210:24.18]Oh my god.
[210:24.82]Okay.

[211:36.34]I got to change the title anyways.
[211:49.90]desert bus.
[211:51.25]I'm getting a chair if we're doing desert bus.
[211:53.55]You don't stand and drive a bus.
[211:55.91]I'm standing.
[211:56.91]Are you standing for eight hours?
[211:58.39]You gonna do that?
[211:59.09]Yeah.
[211:59.65]You sure about that?
[212:00.43]Yeah, or I'll go back on the ground.
[212:04.27]Yeah, stand for eight hours.
[212:05.37]It's a great idea.
[212:08.49]Oh, man.
[212:09.05]That was fucking funny.
[212:13.29]Alright, let's do it.
[212:17.90]I'm gonna load into...

[212:33.56]Go use the bathroom.
[212:34.24]We'll switch off.
[212:36.22]Plenty of time when you're on the bus.
[212:38.88]Yeah, we'll be fine.
[212:41.64]Pee before the trip.
[212:42.44]We're going to be fine.
[212:47.61]Okay, opening it up.
[212:48.47]This is how easy it is to do.
[212:49.93]I have no idea how to...
[212:52.89]I have to open, like, the SteamVR... Launch Desert Bus directly in SteamVR mode.
[213:05.12]Okay.
[213:07.68]I think it's working.
[213:09.76]You look like you've been through hell.
[213:12.92]Kinda have.
[213:14.26]That's what it feels like.
[213:30.14]Who knew that like a fucking funny youtuber game was gonna be so funny I'm gonna drop this volume So
[213:50.65]People are saying that we need to go take a pee break, but I don't believe them.

[213:54.75]Yeah, I'm good.
[213:55.57]I'm in the game.
[213:56.23]You want to drive?
[213:57.05]You want me to drive?
[213:57.63]You can take first shift.
[214:01.33]It's so fucking filthy in here.
[214:05.23]I don't know how to get together in a game, though.
[214:07.96]Hold on.
[214:08.24]I gotta clean this.
[214:08.82]It is filthy in there.
[214:12.32]Filthy.
[214:14.36]It's like, okay, somebody came in my room and put peanut butter in my Vive headset as a prank.
[214:19.62]A prank.
[214:23.51]That's how ridiculous this looks.
[214:29.63]This is wet from sweat.
[214:31.49]I figured it out.
[214:32.05]I'll throw in the fucking laundry.
[214:35.35]Oh, man.

[219:09.83]There's this thing that keeps making my controllers vibrate like harder than I've ever felt.
[219:22.15]It's concerning me.
[219:23.06]I don't know what this is.
[219:25.26]This is more of a dare than a game.
[219:27.22]It's supposed to be terrible.
[219:35.25]Oh, no, no, no.
[219:38.95]Okay, you know what?

[222:11.32]Yeah, good luck with that.
[222:14.55]How fast can you go?
[222:36.11]About this fast.
[222:38.37]Oh, that's you hitting the tires on the side.
[222:44.15]What?
[222:44.65]That's what that is.
[223:03.74]What does this do?
[223:10.68]Is this the radio?
[223:12.00]How do I change the station?
[223:18.53]Get down from there this instant!
[223:22.05]Behind the yellow line.
[223:23.19]I'm going to tell your mother about that.
[223:29.73]That's going to be in my write-up.
[223:33.89]I just walked through the window.
[223:36.89]Alright, I'm out.
[223:47.03]Already?
[223:56.03]We didn't even last one minute.
[223:59.07]No, we didn't last one minute.
[224:00.65]I thought we'd at least be able to walk around the bus.
[224:04.16]Yeah, it didn't last a minute.
[224:05.64]Sign in or restart, Steve.
[224:06.80]No, no, no, no.

[224:14.10]Or are you, like, tapped out?
[224:18.20]Let's do it, because we're only going to do it for, like, five minutes anyway.
[224:21.34]Probably.
[224:24.84]I'm not sure how you can group with people.
[224:28.01]I guess we'll have to find out.
[224:37.86]Eight hour stream.
[224:39.90]Oh, yeah, that was that was a good eight hours in there We didn't last fucking 15 seconds Is this game good?
[224:51.41]Yeah, is it okay?
[224:56.20]You need an entire dedicated weekend for desert bus

[225:04.70]That was ridiculous.
[225:05.98]We made it all the way to Vegas.
[225:07.60]It's pretty cool.
[225:09.42]Alright, let's open it.
[225:10.56]This is like squishing my eyes.
[225:11.76]Alright, this should be opening.
[225:26.21]Drunken boffite killed me.

[225:44.41]Uh, why am I already fighting somebody?
[225:47.35]Um... Who is this?
[225:50.77]Is this Tutorial, or I don't get it?
[225:52.11]That's Tutorial Bot.
[225:54.83]Um... Okay.
[225:57.23]This looks kind of good.
[225:58.81]This looks like it could be a lot of fun.
[226:01.06]it is actually very very well physics simulation very well good okay if you press the menu button um there should be a multiplayer I've never done the multiplayer uh you're gonna have to you're gonna go real easy on me man yeah well I'm trying to are you tommy pickles yes
[226:32.13]sent you a challenge that I think shows up on your right it does how do I say yes uh I'm not sure okay all right also if you want it to like if you go to your computer I'm not that tall I am not that tall it was as tall as the top of the staircase this is my life
[226:59.35]wait wait wait wait wait this is very important okay very important so if you go back to the menu and go to settings um settings people are gonna throw up if you use first person cam but you can like make it uh I forget what the option is uh in-game positioning uh go to the eyeball the top middle do you have quality higher camera
[227:26.43]spectator camera yeah the eyeball at the top yeah so enable the spectator camera yeah it's already because if you're in first person mode people will throw up it's like 50 field of view uh okay well this enable spectator camera is checked uh it's definitely this first person uncheck it is it how does this look uncheck spectator all right no let's
[228:00.14]It's fine.
[228:01.12]It looks alright.
[228:10.53]Wait, how do you get the funny masks?
[228:12.89]There's the funny mask options too.
[228:14.47]What?
[228:24.83]uh yeah I don't know how to change it because normally you can like pull the camera to anywhere you want whoops I hit my mic yeah you smashed your mic all right I'm ready to just do a little volley here hold on my sound is like zero one second this does feel really good though
[229:01.15]You don't even need a ping pong table.
[229:03.15]Just return the one that you bought.
[229:04.33]Aw, yeah!
[229:19.90]Aw, yeah!
[229:36.57]Did anybody tell me I was getting that close?
[229:39.29]That was bad.
[229:39.93]That was like break something bad.
[229:41.19]You can move the table around with the left hand trigger.
[229:44.39]You can like adjust where you are.
[229:45.93]Is this all right?
[229:51.78]Oh, shit.
[229:52.16]Oh, that was the worst one.
[229:53.08]Yeah, that was the absolute worst one.
[229:54.58]That was like I'm trying to break this controller in half.
[229:58.74]Yeah, how do I kick this?
[229:59.54]Look, I'm like, look at how far away from the table I am.
[230:01.68]How do I do that?
[230:04.08]Uh, I don't know, because your controller's different.
[230:07.05]Left hand, trigger.
[230:09.57]You hold and you can move the table.
[230:11.99]You can be like a tiny boy.
[230:19.11]Because like here, I'm too close.
[230:27.74]Right hand, trigger.
[230:30.10]Left.
[230:31.28]Is everyone saying right?
[230:33.31]There's a dent in the wall.
[230:34.77]Shut the fuck up.
[230:35.61]Don't tell me that.
[230:48.74]This is a fucking new desk too.
[230:51.34]God damn it.
[230:53.97]Ooh, I can see where I fucking made a problem here.
[230:56.29]I like chipped it.
[231:01.72]Oh, okay, I see what you're talking about for spectator cam.
[231:05.39]Nah, it's not doing that because I have open VR.
[231:09.13]I see what you mean, though.
[231:15.27]Do you?
[231:15.61]Yeah, because when I take my headset off, I can see it.
[231:20.70]But I need to figure out how to get this not the way... Just send OBS to the game capture?
[231:32.99]I could just pull it, can't I?
[231:34.27]Yeah.
[231:34.41]Let me just do that real quick.
[231:36.05]Because it creates, yeah, the screen on your monitor is the drag around camera.
[231:43.41]Let's see.
[231:46.21]Is that it?
[231:49.91]There it is.
[231:51.67]There it is.
[231:59.70]But the problem is I need to pull this table closer.
[232:04.66]It should be one of your triggers to move the table.
[232:07.10]I've done them both.
[232:08.54]Do I have to physically grab the table?
[232:12.58]Uh, no.
[232:13.04]Anywhere you push, everything turns white and you can move the table.
[232:17.58]For me, it's underneath the trigger on the left hand.
[232:21.62]See, when I press that, I get the ball.
[232:23.74]And then I have menu.
[232:28.38]Do the Vive controllers have two triggers?
[232:29.86]They have, like, the buttons.
[232:31.92]But, like, looking at your hand, what does it say?
[232:34.51]menu ball oh mine has a hold to reposition thing can you move it for me no change back switch back change back what what's wrong with this
[233:02.18]It's on the right hand.
[233:03.16]Okay, right hand trigger.
[233:04.88]Not doing anything.
[233:05.78]Right hand grip.
[233:06.78]Doesn't do anything.
[233:07.54]Right hand button.
[233:09.03]Not doing anything.
[233:10.47]Grips.
[233:11.55]Triggers.
[233:12.59]Both triggers.
[233:14.47]Pads.
[233:16.01]Haptic.
[233:19.37]Where is this?
[233:19.87]Maybe it's in the settings.
[233:27.35]Room.
[233:28.61]Challenger.
[233:29.65]What does your right hand trigger do?
[233:32.53]Uh... Anything?
[233:33.97]Hold on.
[233:36.49]Studio... In-game positioning?
[233:45.82]Maybe that's what it is and I unchecked it?
[233:47.22]Let's just see what happens.
[233:51.90]Maybe, I have that checked.
[233:57.45]Okay, there we go.
[233:58.37]So it's this.
[234:03.94]There we, that's my, okay, that's a thousand times better.
[234:06.14]This thing wasn't selected somehow.
[234:10.26]All right, I'm ready.
[234:11.59]How close am I to the fucking, okay, I'm good.
[234:16.41]Actually, I need, all right, I'm good.
[234:17.93]What is happening with my, I'm so tangled up.
[234:20.90]Look at this bullshit, guys.
[234:44.73]I'm just seeing a cat head spin in circles.
[234:49.74]I probably shouldn't be doing this, but I have enough strength to be able to do it, I think.
[235:01.30]Alright, that made it better?
[235:03.66]Or worse?
[235:04.10]I have no fucking clue.
[235:09.32]It's a mess down here.
[235:12.26]Wait, hold on.
[235:17.71]All right, fuck it, let's go.
[235:19.25]Ready?
[235:20.33]Ready?
[235:20.87]I'm ready.
[235:26.55]You win.
[235:27.93]That was it.
[235:29.27]I won.
[235:30.61]That's the whole thing.
[235:42.35]Oh, boy.
[235:48.70]It's really weird without sound.
[235:49.96]Why are you not playing a sound?
[235:52.56]I don't know.
[235:53.72]I can't get it to work.
[236:04.17]Yeah.
[236:07.13]Damn it.
[236:11.03]It's in the game.
[236:16.27]I just thought about the drunken fight game.
[236:22.21]Damn it.
[236:25.14]In the game.
[236:31.86]I'm gonna like pull my headset from the ceiling like that.
[236:35.14]Mine's like fucked up here too.
[236:37.80]Alright, let's do a ranked match, you and me.
[236:40.27]Ranked.
[236:41.61]How do I ready?
[236:42.17]What did you do?
[236:43.81]On the left side, ranked.
[236:45.67]Let me try one more time to get my sound to work.
[236:52.49]German has a weak backhand.
[236:56.49]I got a weak every hand.
[237:01.53]First person.
[237:02.33]Put the first person cam back on.
[237:05.02]See, everyone wants the first person cam, man.
[237:06.68]They don't like this, like, weird spectator mode.
[237:11.18]Alright, I'm good.
[237:12.12]Alright, fine.
[237:13.20]If they want to vomit.
[237:15.78]I got you guys, don't worry.
[237:20.90]I wasn't even... I tried to... Yeah, see, you're gonna... I keep wanting to touch the table.
[237:27.25]Everyone's doing vomit emotes.
[237:31.79]You asked for this!
[237:32.45]Alright, I'm ready.
[237:34.61]Uh, I don't know how to ready.
[237:38.68]Uh, to the left of the table is a... it says ranked and unranked.
[237:41.02]Oh, okay, I got it.
[237:42.10]Game one, ranked.
[237:44.20]Your serve.
[237:46.72]Your serve.
[237:52.07]Your serve.
[238:01.27]OK.
[238:07.63]OK.

[238:22.81]God damn it.
[238:23.63]Here, here we go.
[238:29.27]Whoops.
[238:32.64]What?
[238:34.32]Oh, that was bullshit.
[238:36.32]You couldn't get that?
[238:37.10]That's a fault?
[238:47.23]You can't throw the ball over the line of the table when you serve.
[239:04.14]Come on, let me get the 30% on you.
[239:07.84]What the fuck did I do?
[239:08.98]But I can't cross the line, bro!
[239:14.43]I can turn that off.
[239:15.91]Actually.
[239:20.09]I got no awareness here.
[239:22.65]Turned it off.
[239:26.91]This is gonna be tighter.
[239:32.06]You ready?
[239:32.70]I'm ready.
[239:41.51]This really is the most dangerous game.
[239:45.86]I've hit the wall more times.
[239:47.22]I've done VR streams, like, eight times.
[239:50.48]Oh, God.
[239:51.60]Oh, my chair's behind me.
[240:15.85]Fucking ate myself!
[240:18.73]That's the worst too, I didn't mean to.
[240:20.09]If you hit anything to the corners, then it's like my walls right here.
[240:23.67]How do you do like the fucking curve?
[240:25.70]What do I do?
[240:29.02]So you go like... No.
[240:34.64]I got it.
[240:38.16]No.
[240:40.82]You got it.
[240:49.51]You're getting it.
[240:50.01]I don't know how to do it, okay?
[240:53.90]That was your fault.
[241:02.41]Whoops.
[241:03.01]Oh, I see what you're doing.
[241:03.91]You're doing like you're pancaking it.
[241:06.21]You got a pancake.
[241:10.15]What was wrong with that?
[241:11.87]It never hit your side.
[241:21.19]Whoa.
[241:25.45]Hey, by the way, your apartment sucks.
[241:30.16]White brick, dirty windows.
[241:34.10]What does that go?
[241:35.32]Why do you have a staircase there?
[241:36.74]But what is up there?
[241:37.82]Your locker's up there?
[241:39.48]No, no, no, no, no.
[241:42.14]You got a lot of shit to talk.
[241:43.28]You haven't even seen my basement.
[241:48.35]I like to come down here when I have some philosophical quandaries about how much taller I am than you.
[241:55.76]Sometimes I just like to, you know, just wonder how could one person be that short?
[242:00.40]We just serve from up here.
[242:21.31]taller every point I get Wow rating 0 to 16 cool dude I'm gonna be ranked 10 million soon I tried to watch the replay
[242:49.89]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[242:51.39]Does it record voices too?
[242:53.87]I don't think so.
[242:56.92]Hold on, how do we... Alright, let's go again.
[243:05.56]Ready?
[243:05.74]Alright, serve.
[243:13.46]Rank it up.

[243:25.76]Okay.
[243:35.17]Okay.
[243:40.03]I got these million dollar pieces.
[243:41.37]Where do you get that from?
[243:42.59]King Tut's tomb?
[243:44.25]Please don't look at it.
[243:45.97]It gets older when you look at it.
[243:47.29]Ah!

[244:04.36]He plays like professional table tennis.
[244:07.06]You know, you just start making things up just so you don't look bad.
[244:12.98]Oh, what did that happen?
[244:17.53]Yosef.
[244:17.81]Yosef.
[244:30.52]I think the five controllers have these big balloon heads.
[244:35.62]And I just gotta start making things up.
[244:37.91]Why did I just try to catch that in my groin?
[244:55.59]What is that fucking glass I can throw at you?
[245:08.51]Nice try, but you didn't get it.
[245:15.64]What the hell was that?

[253:32.68]Just watch my stream.
[253:35.14]Just turn on my stream.
[253:36.86]You really think you're gonna learn anything?
[253:41.22]Just get, like, VR window and open up my stream while you stream.
[253:46.64]Oh, wait, you're not streaming.
[253:50.76]Well, technically you are.
[253:54.53]Technically we're all streaming.
[253:57.69]Two to six.
[254:02.13]I caught it.
[254:02.55]Doesn't count.
[254:05.99]Whoops.
[254:10.96]Like, how do you do that?
[254:12.76]That, like... Just hit it.
[254:17.08]You're, like, charging up an EX move.
[254:18.77]I can, like, see you doing it.
[254:21.49]You go, like... Because you gotta... You gotta do it.
[254:29.19]But I can't explain it to you.
[254:30.48]You have a fighting game tell when you're going to do that.
[254:33.76]I feel like I should parry you.
[254:36.35]Like, I need to go, well, parry this.
[254:42.99]That's not going to work.
[254:49.61]You know, let me tell you one thing about that.
[254:55.73]Oh, hit the edge.
[254:57.55]Game sucks.
[255:03.25]You know, I could see.
[255:04.91]how two table tennis enthusiasts could really play this and add love every second of it.
[255:12.04]The physics are surprisingly accurate.
[255:15.70]I was pointing it out on my stream, there's like two things it does wrong, but they're not super relevant.
[255:25.04]The biggest way you can tell, you can actually change how much thin your paddle has.
[255:30.72]Oh, really?
[255:31.02]And the options and everything, and change what kind of paddle it is.
[255:34.16]But if you have a really spinny paddle and you just put the ball on it and you move the ball around, it's creepily accurate to what it would do and how it would feel.
[255:43.92]The feedback when you hit the ball, that little like... Yeah.
[255:47.83]It's like... You can actually feel like... You actually feel like Spider-Man, you know what I'm saying?
[255:54.59]Yeah, I know what you're saying.
[256:11.14]Hey, pro tip.
[256:13.17]Hey, pro tip.
[256:15.31]You're not listening.
[256:16.25]If I swing down, the ball's going to drop down.
[256:19.79]If I swing up, the ball's going to go up.
[256:22.95]When you see me doing these big swings and your paddle's flat, it's going to go straight down.
[256:29.17]Okay, so when you go like this, go like this.
[256:30.77]And when you go like this, go like this.
[256:33.11]When I go down, you need to make your paddle like this.
[256:36.49]So when it hits here, down is forward.
[256:38.99]If you get it, down is forward now.
[256:43.12]Oh, okay, so like in one of those mirror puzzle games where I have to bend the laser?
[256:48.84]Yes, you have to bend the laser.
[256:50.25]Move the laser with the mirror into the spot and you get the key?
[256:52.89]Yeah.
[256:53.49]Okay.
[256:53.73]Yeah.
[256:58.57]You did it.
[256:59.13]That was good.
[257:04.34]Why am I hearing voices?
[257:05.32]Is this the first time you've asked yourself that?
[257:09.40]No, no, no, no, no.
[257:13.41]I'm hearing voices.
[257:17.25]I swear.
[257:17.77]Sorry.
[257:22.31]Got him.
[257:28.43]That didn't count?
[257:28.99]What?
[257:30.47]That's my point.
[257:36.81]I had to itch.
[257:37.41]I have an inside of my nose itch.
[257:46.48]See?
[258:00.24]Wait, you're in the closet.
[258:02.50]Get out of my way!
[258:03.24]I thought I was in the closet the whole time.
[258:06.94]Alright, how you doing?
[258:10.16]You good?
[258:10.90]Watch replay.
[258:12.92]Why would you want me to watch this one?
[258:19.26]Alright, I'll watch the replay.
[258:28.35]What?
[258:33.19]Come on, where's the game?
[258:35.24]What?
[258:36.24]I have a replay, it's not playing.
[258:40.28]Why do you keep watching the replay?
[258:42.08]You just played.
[258:43.60]Because Chad's saying watch replay.
[258:52.68]Anything else you want to do?
[258:54.88]I could do this forever, so.
[258:56.34]You could do this forever.
[258:58.34]I get trapped in the loop.
[259:04.27]One guy.
[259:07.95]Watch the thought of what one person says.
[259:09.99]Do you have anything else?
[259:12.65]Do you have any other experiences you want to just try?
[259:18.38]It would be cool if I could show you the minigame, but I can't.
[259:22.08]No.
[259:22.67]Because you can't actually multiplayer that, so not really, no.
[259:24.91]Let me just see.
[259:28.53]Listen to the voices.
[259:34.68]Let me see what else we got.
[259:35.60]Oh, we can go for like four and a half hours or so.
[259:45.96]Turma looks really dirty.
[259:47.04]I'm just really sweaty.
[259:51.33]Pavlov.
[259:52.13]Everybody wants us to play Pavlov.
[259:55.07]I would play it, but I think we should do it another day.
[259:57.13]You want to do it another day?
[259:57.87]Make it its own thing, yeah.
[260:00.24]What are you doing tomorrow?
[260:04.28]Playing Pavlov with you.
[260:05.34]You want to play Pavlov tomorrow?
[260:07.96]Sure.
[260:09.52]I don't think I'm doing anything.
[260:12.45]It's up to you.
[260:13.81]Yeah, I'm saying yes.
[260:15.33]Okay.
[260:15.87]Maybe we'll get another couple to play.
[260:19.05]he's bruised yeah I have like actually bruised cheeks are we getting desert bust today we completed it we did the whole thing yeah it's over uh I'm like so into vr sorry that I'm like a vr streamer like now we had uh pavlov onward there was a couple others what was that list
[260:48.12]Show controller?
[260:48.78]Oh, here, I'll show you.
[260:49.40]I don't know if you can see it in the camera, but I chipped off the front here.
[260:57.07]See like that?
[260:58.51]Wait till it defocuses.
[261:05.67]Right here.
[261:07.03]There's like an indent.
[261:09.07]And like it's white.
[261:13.22]I like...
[261:17.28]uh let me see yeah this is like a bunch of stuff to play are you still here yeah uh I can't find where the thing is in this game robot I can't even find it I just want to play like mind show there's so much like vr I want to play
[261:43.36]But, um, we can call it here if you want.
[261:45.16]Take a break.
[261:45.63]Because the drunken bar fight game, I act like... Sometimes I get in one of these games and like an after an hour goes by and I'm just in constant fucking pain from either laughing or like fucking wheezing.
[262:00.22]There's a multiplayer mod for Beat Saber?
[262:02.04]Are you serious?
[262:03.61]To my understanding, it's just that it shows your scores at the same time.
[262:08.23]So you're competing for a better score on the same level.
[262:12.37]If there's something else, I don't know about it.
[262:14.70]People are saying we should play Minecraft in VR.
[262:18.62]Oh yeah, Minecraft!
[262:20.28]God, no.
[262:23.36]Yeah, we'll play some more stuff tomorrow.
[262:25.62]We'll do Pavlov tomorrow.
[262:26.90]We'll give Pavlov a real... Because that's like a full-on multiplayer shooter experience, isn't it?
[262:36.01]Pavlong?
[262:37.07]Pavlong.
[262:37.47]I think so.
[262:38.73]Alright, well.
[262:40.87]If that's what I think it is, then yeah.
[262:42.41]That's probably good as any time to call it for the day.
[262:46.13]I'm gonna wake up sore tomorrow.
[262:47.92]That's this thing.
[262:48.88]I've been playing so much VR, I'm building up my muscular tolerance again.
[262:52.38]You should do Mindshow for your own full stream.
[263:00.71]Yeah, that's why.
[263:01.67]Like Mr. VR.
[263:06.14]You alright?
[263:08.09]How many times did I slam into a wall today?
[263:09.55]Like six?
[263:12.01]How many times did he slam into a wall?
[263:15.75]Like two?
[263:16.23]I think it was two.
[263:22.99]You sunk my battleship today.
[263:26.95]We love the VR, it's not a problem.
[263:28.59]I mean, it's just so much fun.
[263:31.29]I've never had this experience before in my life.
[263:33.93]So, it's worth having.
[263:37.39]Alright, let me get this off.
[263:39.33]And, uh... We'll start probably around the same time tomorrow if you want.
[263:45.19]So thanks for hanging out, everybody.
[263:48.13]Yeah, this will be just about a four and a half, five hour stream.
[263:51.79]It's kind of what they've been.
[263:52.65]It's just only so long I can do it.
[263:56.39]Ugh.
[263:57.25]But yeah, I'll be in touch.
[264:00.17]We'll figure out what games we're going to play.
[264:06.63]Bye, everyone.
[264:07.27]Say bye.
[264:08.27]And he has a Twitch, you know.
[264:10.65]And I have a YouTube channel where I'm not allowed to upload videos anymore.
[264:13.78]Yeah, that's true.
[264:15.26]It's a court order.
[264:17.44]Can we get a stir link here?
[264:21.78]What's your number one game, man?
[264:22.72]Apex?
[264:25.29]My other, my what?
[264:26.23]What's your number one game, man?
[264:27.55]Like, Apex?
[264:30.47]Getting dirty in the club.
[264:34.89]I stream it all.
[264:37.89]You've really been into that, like, press the button with the monster voice today.
[264:40.80]I like the monster voice because it really... Then you know I'm for real.
[264:48.70]I'm going to physically type your name.
[264:52.36]It's Stir, right?
[264:57.95]I don't know.
[264:58.29]You change your name sometimes.
[264:59.43]There it is.
[265:01.95]Like four years ago.
[265:03.33]Who is this?
[265:04.03]I don't even know who he is anymore.
[265:05.64]Dude, we played Lethal League like a week ago.
[265:07.26]Relax.
[265:08.88]What is your name?
[265:09.44]Like German948?
[265:10.18]Something like that.
[265:14.12]Yeah, we already talked about the forest.
[265:15.24]He didn't want to do the forest because it was going to take too long.
[265:18.28]Yeah, I didn't want a full stream of a full game.
[265:20.78]A full forest stream.
[265:24.64]Oh, man.
[265:26.70]Alright, well, I'll see you tomorrow.
[265:28.24]We'll play some more.
[265:28.96]Yeah, thanks for our first ever collab we did today.
[265:31.56]Maybe we can do more.
[265:32.66]Yeah.
[265:33.98]Now have a good night.
[265:35.73]Good night.
[265:37.09]Bye.
[265:39.11]Yeah, we'll see you.
[265:40.07]I'm just putting weird pressure on my eyes and eyebrows, and I feel like my eyebrows... I look like a different person.
[265:50.04]It's like squishing my eyelids.
[265:52.58]Alright, let's get to the bits here.
[265:55.21]See you guys tomorrow.
[265:57.29]If you've taken off.
[265:59.07]More multiplayer VR.
[266:02.87]I'm going to pad my room.
[266:07.31]You look weird when you do that.
[266:09.23]I look weird probably every day.
[266:13.12]Do Google Earth VR?
[266:14.30]Can you do that in multiplayer?
[266:16.30]That doesn't work in multiplayer, does it?
[266:23.15]Alright, let's get out of this.
[266:25.09]And put this up.
[266:26.89]No, that's not VRB.
[266:29.19]We need the see you later one.
[266:33.04]There it goes.
[266:33.68]Okay, let me get out of here.
[266:35.12]Payday 2 has VR.
[266:36.64]Yeah.
[266:39.08]I had fucking a lot of fun though.
[266:41.90]Even in like Rec Room.
[266:44.22]And then that zombie game started out kind of a little bit annoying, but turned out to be absolutely fucking fun.
[266:57.11]I can see how if you get four of your friends, that would be some of the most fun you could probably have.
[267:01.54]But no, that's... I love it.
[267:08.58]So, we'll see you tomorrow.
[267:10.08]Here come the bits.
[267:11.82]Thanks everyone for sticking around.
[267:13.90]See you real soon.
[267:15.92]And let's go back, uh, about four to four and a half hours ago here.
[267:21.34]Stir hosted you with one viewer.
[267:30.32]What?
[267:30.70]Him?
[267:31.88]Was it him?
[267:32.52]Was it he the only one?
[267:33.46]Thanks a lot, Stir, for the host.
[267:42.31]That's so funny.
[267:45.69]It was just him.
[267:47.89]You probably didn't do it right.
[267:50.87]Oh, my God.
[267:52.49]Thank you, Divas, for the $2.50.
[267:53.23]Appreciate it.
[268:00.12]Let me get the chat out here.
[268:02.69]The actual chat.
[268:06.51]Let me shut down that VR real quick.
[268:14.45]Is there a multiplayer horror game?
[268:15.82]No, there really isn't.
[268:17.72]That's kind of sad and unfortunate.
[268:22.36]We've been looking.
[268:24.56]There really is not a horror VR multiplayer game.
[268:32.45]unfortunately raw data is kind of horror jet island he won't play it he already told me he's like he saw me playing that game and he's like I wouldn't be able to do it it's hard enough to make a good multiplayer horror game in general anyway yeah it is
[269:00.34]But thank you to Divas.
[269:03.30]Thank you Bake Me Home for the $2.50.
[269:04.48]Thank you Fitty for the $5.
[269:08.72]This makes it $100,000.
[269:10.84]Can you please release my family now?
[269:14.20]Are they even alive still?
[269:15.66]Please, Jeremy.
[269:19.42]Thank you Fitty for the $5.
[269:20.68]Appreciate it.
[269:25.04]Numb.
[269:25.46]Thank you Numb Legs for the $10.
[269:26.38]Thank you.
[269:30.24]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[269:35.56]There's a horror game called The Exorcist Legion VR.
[269:37.82]Is that... Didn't acknowledge what?
[269:43.36]Oh, oh, oh, you guys... Okay, so you mean... Is The Exorcist multiplayer?
[269:50.41]Or is it just single player?
[269:58.82]Exorcist VR is supposed to be legit.
[270:01.90]I'm telling you, that Dread Halls was one of the most nerve-wracking, stressful horror games I've ever played.
[270:10.62]And yeah, I'm a little biased here because it's one of the only VR horror games I've ever played.
[270:17.50]But it was horrible.
[270:20.84]Still gonna do Mind Show?
[270:21.70]Yes.
[270:21.78]Yes.
[270:24.59]This co-op VR kind of couple of streams here in a row with Star, they just kind of happened.
[270:31.74]So my plan wasn't really part of the plan, but we were just like, hey, let's do it.
[270:39.86]But thank you, Zombie Man, for the five bucks.
[270:42.42]Sorry, German, for the messages.
[270:43.48]I was trying to send cheers your way.
[270:45.80]And they are right next to my friend invite.
[270:48.66]No, that's fine.
[270:49.24]Don't worry about it, man.
[270:54.28]Thank you for the five bucks.
[270:55.08]Appreciate it.
[270:58.84]Miss Melon Tea, thanks for the 250.
[271:01.40]It's really nice to draw some pixel art watching your streams, Jerma.
[271:04.62]Glad to catch your streams when I'm not working.
[271:06.26]Seriously appreciate the company from both you and the Discord chat.
[271:10.44]Jerma Hart.
[271:13.64]Thank you.
[271:13.94]If I could just kind of be in the background while you do some work, that's awesome.
[271:22.23]Glad you're hanging out.
[271:22.87]Glad you can relax.
[271:28.55]And we do have a pretty good Discord community.
[271:29.99]If you haven't joined it yet, it is there.
[271:32.19]It's available.
[271:33.85]It's open to the public.
[271:35.59]There is one sub-only room, but the whole thing is open to the public.
[271:42.11]Just good people there.
[271:44.43]Discord.
[271:45.69]Not discourse.
[271:46.51]Discord.
[271:49.26]But thank you, Miss Melon Tea.
[271:51.75]And then Bloody Doctor gave $50 earlier.
[271:53.57]I missed it completely.
[271:55.37]I don't have notifications on when I'm in VR.
[271:58.95]Because I find it hard to pull out and see.
[272:03.16]So I don't have notifications on.
[272:05.54]But if you do end up seeing this Bloody Doctor, thank you so much for the $50.
[272:08.24]It's a lot of money.
[272:09.44]It means a lot.
[272:16.27]The TJ, thanks for the five community subs.
[272:22.03]They came in a few hours ago.
[272:25.67]And then TJ, right after that, gave $15.
[272:30.19]Hey, Jeremy, back again from overseas.
[272:32.41]Showing my love again with the deployment.
[272:34.31]Cashola, have fun in VR, my dudes.
[272:36.70]I'm off to my plane now.
[272:37.86]We'll have to catch back up with the VOD.
[272:39.96]Peace stream, boys.
[272:43.46]Thank you so much.
[272:44.22]Welcome back.
[272:48.34]Yeah, I really appreciate the five community subs and the $15.
[272:54.76]Thank you.
[273:04.93]When's this shit start?
[273:06.17]Let's party.
[273:08.63]Sark.
[273:10.85]What's up, Sark?
[273:13.69]You wanna play VR?
[273:14.89]You wanna do some VR bullshit?
[273:16.40]I'm down.
[273:17.96]But I'm... My eyes can only take like four to five hours, though.
[273:24.09]My brain can actually only handle it for like four hours.
[273:31.57]It's good to see you, Gündo.
[273:32.25]Hope you're doing well, Sark.
[273:37.30]Can we turn off the slow mode?
[273:38.72]Uh, yeah, we can probably turn it off now.
[273:41.64]We're at the end of the stream.
[273:42.56]Probably just dump the slow mode.
[273:48.30]I just puked when he said VR.
[273:54.37]Can we turn up slow mode?
[273:56.61]Now you don't turn it up.
[274:00.43]Sports Bar VR has multiplayer games.
[274:03.15]Probably check it out.
[274:03.79]We have a list.
[274:05.13]We picked, uh... Over the last day or two, I've been just doing some research to find some good ones.
[274:10.53]And there's a list of, like, 15 games we have.
[274:13.35]And we sort of just kind of threw darts, and we're like, that one, that one, that one, that one, and that one.
[274:18.59]And that's what we'll have time to do, I guess.
[274:21.19]So we'll do that again for tomorrow.
[274:28.62]But thank you, Combine, for the 5, 6, 7, 8 dollars and 87 cents.
[274:35.76]Thank you.
[274:37.88]Why can't you do such a simple thing as walking, you absolute donut?
[274:41.50]Please actually tell me, you absolute goddamn buffoon.
[274:45.26]I love your videos, man.
[274:46.26]Cheers.
[274:48.89]Well, that was during the survive portion of the stream.
[274:52.21]And I had, like, the arms moving thing set up.
[274:54.53]And you saw on screen that it was really, really wonky.
[274:58.79]It didn't work out what I thought it was.
[275:00.97]I changed and did just fine.
[275:04.19]But thank you.
[275:05.37]Appreciate it.
[275:07.85]You absolute donut.
[275:10.29]I'll move those words around.
[275:11.49]It's fucking you fucking absolute unit.
[275:15.23]I'm a unit.
[275:16.15]I'm a unit.
[275:17.64]Thanks, man.
[275:18.00]Appreciate that.
[275:20.64]They also say, your face brightens up my dull days whenever I come home from work.
[275:24.66]Your presence gives me warmth like no other person, not even your father.
[275:29.29]Jerma, I'm so proud of you and all of your brothers.
[275:32.53]Jack, Jomi, Garence, and little Jerma, my lovely boys.
[275:35.43]You are my absolute champion of a boy.
[275:37.57]You must come visit me sometime.
[275:38.86]Sincerely, your loving, proud mother, Combine.
[275:41.90]P.S.
[275:42.52]Here's my social security number.
[275:48.36]Thank you.
[275:49.90]Uh, Peaceful Hayley, thanks for the 250, Peaceful Hayley.
[275:53.36]Hey Jerma, today's stream was a lot of fun.
[275:54.76]I couldn't stop laughing the whole time.
[275:56.02]Anyways, hope all is well for you.
[275:58.00]Have a good night, Jerma, and chat.
[276:00.91]Thank you, Hayley.
[276:04.05]Always a pleasure, thank you.
[276:06.59]Glad you had fun.
[276:07.89]Read it?
[276:08.77]Fine.
[276:09.75]No.
[276:10.31]No, it's a joke.
[276:10.87]It's like, it's J9858985.
[276:13.48]I read that completely wrong.
[276:15.96]I don't want to read that out loud.
[276:16.82]What if it's real somehow?
[276:20.53]Hey, Frodian Weapon, thanks for the 250.
[276:23.65]Mostly lost, thanks for 250.
[276:26.43]How are you so bad at Five Finger Filet in Red Dead Redemption, but you're perfect at it in a VR game?
[276:32.93]Because that shit's real life!
[276:35.36]I could do that in real life.
[276:40.34]Because I don't have to... I'm not physically lifting my hand up in Red Dead, I'm doing like... X... Circle, square, triangle, X, circle, square, triangle, square, square, square, triangle, X.
[276:56.89]I just got a flash of Star doing, like, the crab walk in the drunk game.
[277:02.20]Oh.
[277:09.94]This is so, oh, so dumb.
[277:12.57]But some, look, look, okay.
[277:14.87]Yeah, that game is like a tuber game.
[277:17.53]But sometimes that don't matter.
[277:18.81]Sometimes that's all you need.
[277:20.59]Just you and a buddy just being just dickheads in a game.
[277:23.35]It's so much fun.
[277:30.59]Sometimes that's actually all you need.
[277:38.54]But thank you to Bloody Doctor again for the five bucks.
[277:42.22]For the love of God, Jerma, your fly is down.
[277:44.45]And they say Star Genius.
[277:45.59]I'm sorry.
[277:46.47]I don't have a fly.
[277:47.15]I'm wearing jogging pants today.
[277:53.11]tuber what the fuck stark uh it's not mr stark mr shark I don't feel so good I don't after vr uh mr sark tuber is just a tube stark uh I don't know why I added the t I'm sorry I was wearing jogging pants not a not a pair of jeans
[278:22.88]How could you play VR without a full workout gear on?
[278:27.44]Like a hoodie and a pair of jeans.
[278:30.50]Sweat would be dripping down my ass.
[278:33.14]I would have to- it would be embarrassing.
[278:34.68]I would turn around during the stream and there would be two fucking huge wet handprint marks on my ass.
[278:45.51]If I was in a pair of jeans.
[278:46.23]It would go right through the jeans.
[278:47.63]It would be horrible.
[278:49.03]I'd probably get like suspended.
[278:56.35]Who's touching your, like, me?
[278:58.25]Like, I'm grabbing and I'm doing an indentation on my jeans.
[279:03.45]And I'm gonna grab and, like, move and push.
[279:15.74]Thank you, Nuke, for the five community subs as well.
[279:19.49]And then Nuke subscribed themselves.
[279:21.77]So, six subs there coming in.
[279:23.98]Thank you for that.
[279:24.64]It means a lot.
[279:30.52]TimmyTimTam, thanks for the $2.50.
[279:31.66]Hey, I think you could do with some comedy tips to be funnier.
[279:35.14]Check out this observational comedy master.
[279:38.25]Is this me?
[279:39.17]Are you linking a clip of me?
[279:46.27]What the hell is this?
[279:48.95]Why do...
[279:52.91]Why do girls have fake mustaches?
[279:55.99]What is this?
[280:01.37]This is not the master of comedy.
[280:03.26]This is why do girls wear fake mustaches.
[280:05.42]It's like a commentary video?
[280:10.28]I don't know.
[280:13.34]Show us.
[280:15.24]I don't... Hold on.
[280:22.24]No, I don't want to, I don't, this is like somebody's like personal channel.
[280:26.94]I don't want to like, I don't know if this is like, I don't know what you're doing.
[280:35.95]Where'd the chat just go?
[280:37.79]I lost you.
[280:41.53]Where the hell did everybody go?
[280:44.90]Oh, there you are.
[280:50.99]There we go.
[280:51.43]Now I can see.
[280:51.93]Why is it doing this?
[280:52.65]Oh, it's because of OVR drop.
[280:53.75]I see.
[280:56.09]You could learn something.
[280:56.97]I don't need to learn anything.
[281:00.92]Comedy is just... It's whatever you want it to be.
[281:09.06]If you think something's funny and I don't, that's comedy for you, not for me.
[281:20.15]That's not true.
[281:21.89]I'm not making a joke.
[281:23.05]All right.
[281:25.89]All I need to know is I won the Junior Massachusetts Stand-Up Championship when I was 14.
[281:32.58]I had an amazing bit about how water... Like, why don't people just drink water out of the ocean?
[281:44.16]And I got like a standing ovation.
[281:46.52]I was 14.
[281:47.22]I had like two jokes.
[281:55.94]I did a thing where I was in a boat, like, pretending to sail around, and it's like, oh my god, what are we, I can't believe we're, we've got no water left!
[282:02.11]And again, it's like, you just drank the water in the ocean, dumb!
[282:07.03]A guy in the front row had to go to the hospital, because he laughed so hard his face turned red, and it turned fucking purple.
[282:15.21]He was like, and like, 15 people had to help him out.
[282:25.33]His family sued me after that for comedy negligence.
[282:28.45]I had a great lawyer.
[282:32.05]There's a rumor that you went to actual clown school.
[282:45.68]Let me, like, hit that right in the... Let me, like, just cut the head off that snake here.
[282:51.30]Um, yes.
[282:52.73]I went to clown college.
[282:55.77]I know all the balloon animals.
[282:56.78]I know dog.
[282:57.32]I know snake.
[282:58.32]I know cat.
[283:02.04]I got the nose.
[283:08.02]I graduated top of my class and in my senior project, I did such an amazing balloon animal.
[283:13.41]One of my instructors actually was sitting in the front row.
[283:15.91]He was, I don't know if he was eating something, but he was like, he couldn't believe how fast I did the balloon animal.
[283:19.57]And he started fucking choking and laughing.
[283:21.71]And like, like fucking 10 paramedics had to come in.
[283:28.25]And he, I almost killed him.
[283:30.46]His family gets a fucking lawyer.
[283:32.52]And that would be the second time that that's happened.
[283:34.10]So I think I have a pretty good track record of making people laugh.
[283:39.80]I did a balloon dog in, like, 1.2 seconds.
[283:43.32]It was so fast he couldn't even handle it.
[283:44.66]He was the instructor of the class.
[283:49.51]Oh my god, I'm choking.
[283:55.93]Nah, don't get your lawyer.
[283:57.13]I got a good one.
[284:03.76]Ugh.
[284:11.02]Hey, what's the deal with water?
[284:12.30]Why don't you just drink it out of the ocean?
[284:13.57]That was on the front page of Time Magazine.
[284:22.23]Up-and-coming comedians.
[284:23.51]That line.
[284:25.43]Top text, bottom text.
[284:27.19]And it was me going like this.
[284:29.63]Like right into the... Here's the cover, right?
[284:33.21]This is Time Magazine.
[284:36.79]And I was like...
[284:41.12]And then the text was up here.
[284:44.21]Why don't you just drink it out of the ocean?
[284:45.93]And I was in a magician's outfit.
[284:48.55]With like a tail and a tie.
[284:50.11]Those are some great years.
[285:11.18]Oh, he's a sad one.
[285:12.74]Alright, let's move on.
[285:13.36]Thank you, Timmy Tim Tim, for the 250.
[285:14.64]That is the... We gotta start it on that.
[285:19.81]You look like shit, man.
[285:20.91]Yeah, I know.
[285:23.95]I know how bad I look right now.
[285:25.47]You think I don't know that?
[285:28.05]I told you guys before, I gave up, like, years ago, giving a shit about, like, looking good on camera.
[285:39.01]No.
[285:40.12]I'm in the virtual world for four and a half hours.
[285:42.86]This is what happens.
[285:44.90]Am I gonna, like, cut the camera off and go get my hair done and then come back and be like... Why would I be praying?
[285:50.87]I don't know.
[285:51.85]I don't know what that game... Why would I have my hands in a prayer?
[286:02.08]Gotta take care of your hair.
[286:05.38]Every post-VR stream, I go into the shower, and I condition.
[286:11.09]I let some nice warm water run through it for a little while, and then I get some nice conditioner, let it sit in my hair for about 30 to 45 seconds, let it sit there, hang out.
[286:22.15]I take the shower attachment off, get it close and run it through, pat dry it, calm it with a brush, and let it just sit there.
[286:35.78]What's my opinion on taking baths?
[286:37.08]I literally took one yesterday.
[286:40.87]And I put a turtle bath bomb in.
[286:45.11]It was like a fizzy bath bomb.
[286:48.19]It was wonderful.
[286:49.03]It turned the water green.
[287:00.83]Have you used the frog soap?
[287:02.47]Not yet.
[287:03.13]Frog soap is sitting out on a dish next to the bathtub.
[287:07.81]I like it.
[287:08.15]I don't want to get rid of it.
[287:08.85]I want to keep it there.
[287:10.86]It's a set piece.
[287:14.28]What's your favorite color?
[287:17.18]Le green.
[287:25.22]Decorative soap.
[287:25.96]Yes, it is.
[287:32.86]You guys don't know what blue-green is?
[287:35.66]It's like the halfway point between blue and green.
[287:42.09]Have I ever shit in a bath?
[287:44.75]Yeah, everybody has.
[287:47.39]Probably more than 20 or 30 times.
[287:49.81]Because when you're between the ages of three and six months, you shit in the bathtub all the time.
[287:57.28]Your parents just didn't tell you that.
[288:01.00]Every single one of you has shit in a bathtub at least ten times.
[288:06.40]At least.
[288:19.75]I'm not so sure.
[288:21.53]No, of course you did.
[288:29.31]Have I ever shit my pants as an adult?
[288:31.17]Yes.
[288:34.30]It's not embarrassing to say that.
[288:41.02]Like, people that tell you they don't, don't believe anybody.
[288:46.63]People pick their nose, they shit their pants, they shit in the bathtub, they pee their pants, they like piss on the wall, they miss the toilet, everybody does this.
[288:54.63]Get rid of the mask, take off the fucking facade here.
[288:59.88]You pee on the seat sometimes, you piss in the shower.
[289:02.96]Can we like stop this bullshit?
[289:08.11]I don't want to go to Jerma's house.
[289:10.67]It's a very clean house.
[289:31.52]Can't even italics have to clean up after him.
[289:34.42]No, all jokes aside, I have a very, very nice, well-kept environment.
[289:41.52]Somebody just said something that I have to say out loud.
[289:43.84]No, I'm not.
[289:44.28]It's the one, it's in all caps.
[289:46.01]Just, that's unbelievable.
[289:47.27]That's insane.
[289:49.07]I've never even thought about that before.
[289:50.47]That's insanity.
[289:52.05]I'm not gonna read it out loud.
[289:58.57]Wow.
[290:00.71]That's so weird.
[290:04.73]What the hell?
[290:05.15]What was that?
[290:05.65]Somebody just tried to post like a... What the fuck was that?
[290:09.50]It was in all caps.
[290:10.18]You could just scroll back.
[290:12.64]Thank you.
[290:12.94]Mostly lost with the $2.50.
[290:14.08]Mindshow should get its own full stream.
[290:16.40]It's VR the movies.
[290:17.50]Yeah.
[290:19.16]I will give Mindshow the time it deserves.
[290:23.38]That's why I haven't really done it yet.
[290:26.16]Because I know...
[290:28.73]I'm certain that I'm not going to want to just jump out of it.
[290:38.51]Somebody already got it.
[290:41.65]But yeah, my show will get the time it deserves.
[290:43.99]Eventually here.
[290:48.34]Eventually.
[290:53.28]Thank you, Shadows1.
[290:57.41]Dis... Disciple.
[291:00.15]Do not say Shadows 1 Discipline.
[291:02.22]There is no end.
[291:04.58]Shadows 1 Dis... Disciple.
[291:07.88]Thanks for the 250.
[291:08.44]Uh, anyway, I found this in the freezer.
[291:13.72]What is this that you found?
[291:19.92]Grillmaster 8 quarter pound patty.
[291:24.40]Have you guys learned nothing from Gordon Ramsay?
[291:29.69]Don't eat frozen patties.
[291:31.32]Grillmaster.
[291:40.62]Patty elitist here.
[291:54.34]I asked you a question, but you didn't reply, or other people too.
[291:56.66]Don't ever think you're too Hollywood to reply to me or the people in your chat.
[292:00.40]Never forget you're just a regular average guy who's just good at a video game.
[292:03.60]Get out of your own ass.
[292:04.48]I mean, you get the first part there, right?
[292:08.10]I'm not very good at video games, though.
[292:11.69]Good at a video game?
[292:12.77]What video game?
[292:22.25]Get out of your own ass.
[292:24.03]I was pretty good in VR.
[292:27.81]You put the patties in your fridge to keep the shape, are you kidding?
[292:31.80]No, you get it fresh cut, bring it home, immediately cook them.
[292:37.98]Not this re-refrigeration shit.
[292:40.16]Mm-mm.
[292:51.03]Step into the ground beef.
[292:54.63]Can you cook?
[292:55.09]Went to culinary school.
[292:56.83]Think I know a thing or two.
[292:59.99]I mean, I don't like to say that.
[293:05.42]It was a double school.
[293:06.44]It was a culinary clown school.
[293:11.02]The balloon animals we made, we ate them afterwards.
[293:19.91]Balloon chicken.
[293:22.75]Balloon cows.
[293:23.67]Balloon turkeys.
[293:25.13]Balloon snakes.
[293:33.07]Use every part of the balloon animal.
[293:34.89]That's right.
[293:37.87]But thank you, Shadows1.
[293:39.61]Disciple for the $2.50.
[293:43.14]Thank you, Kimchi.
[293:44.10]Kimchi for the $10.
[293:45.96]I was broke.
[293:46.60]Now I'm not.
[293:47.20]Here's some money.
[293:48.44]You're the only streamer I watch.
[293:49.68]Thank you for always doing so much for us and making the best streams.
[293:55.36]Thank you, Kimchi.
[293:57.60]Uh... I just aim to have fun.
[294:04.42]Hopefully you guys think the same.
[294:05.58]I'm just trying... I'm just trying to have a good time.
[294:11.15]That's all.
[294:13.31]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[294:16.23]I'm honored to be the only person that you watch.
[294:19.03]Thank you.
[294:22.67]Uh, Tingy!
[294:23.17]Thank you, Tingy, for the $2.50.
[294:23.87]Thank you.
[294:25.99]So James got a kick out of one of your emotes after seeing it in his chat.
[294:29.45]I think it's safe to say that he liked it.
[294:34.42]Oh, wait, like, oh, I see.
[294:35.92]Hold on.
[294:37.02]Can you guys hear that?
[294:37.58]I have to change my desktop audio.
[294:40.42]Let's see if we can hear this now.
[294:46.27]Can we hear this now?
[294:47.87]Yes, we can.
[294:48.59]And that was so loud.
[294:49.89]I'm so sorry again.
[294:51.15]All right, let's see.
[294:53.69]What is it?
[294:53.93]It's a clip.
[294:57.13]What's he playing?
[295:01.37]Metro Exodus.
[295:03.37]Uh, if you haven't played Metro Exodus, I might not look at the screen for a little, for like 30 to 40 seconds.
[295:11.29]That was way louder.
[295:12.15]He's getting closer.
[295:18.65]He's getting closer.
[295:19.89]Alright, let's see.
[295:26.19]Let's take a look.
[295:30.20]The guy sounds like Willem Dafoe.
[295:33.68]The voice actor.
[295:36.08]Green Goblin, dude.
[295:48.59]Ew, what is that fucking emo, dude?
[295:50.77]Ew.
[295:50.91]Is that a fucking Jerma emo, but it's also Willem Dafoe?
[295:56.20]What the fuck is that emo?
[296:03.58]I never would have pieced that together that he looks like- that he looks like him.
[296:08.46]Oh, that's fun.
[296:09.38]Everybody probably thinks I'm such a fucking weirdo.
[296:18.69]Eww!
[296:32.65]Uh, thank you for that.
[296:37.93]Well, you are.
[296:38.73]I mean... I don't know.
[296:42.31]Get back.
[296:46.06]That person better be, like, spreading magical cheer like Santa Claus shit out their car.
[296:52.46]I will not be upset anymore about this.
[296:54.62]If that guy has, like, a bag of magic sand that he's throwing out and it, like, has good luck charms in it for everybody...
[297:04.50]Every day.
[297:07.56]CluelessSniper, thanks for the $2.50.
[297:09.92]$2.50.
[297:11.04]Thanks.
[297:15.28]Thank you also to Strawberry Pulp for the $10.
[297:21.98]$10 from Strawberry Pulp.
[297:24.08]This might sound silly, but I had kind of a crappy week and this stream really helped cheer me up.
[297:28.21]Thanks for everything you do.
[297:29.55]Cheer my heart.
[297:33.70]I'm sorry you're not having a good week.
[297:37.22]But, uh... As sorry as I am that you're not having a good week, I am... happy that you can come here and hang out and have a good time.
[297:45.96]That'll make you... possibly not think about any bullshit, you know what I mean?
[297:51.09]Thank you for the 10 bucks strawberry pulp.
[297:59.55]Take care.
[297:59.91]Thank you.
[298:03.01]A Growdive!
[298:03.93]Thank you Growdive for the five bucks.
[298:06.55]Check out Wildlands 2.
[298:09.05]It has multiplayer and similar vibes to Jet Island, but more focused on rope swinging.
[298:12.98]Is it VR?
[298:14.28]I'm assuming it is.
[298:22.26]There's so much VR.
[298:25.04]I've got such a backlog, it's overwhelming.
[298:29.78]Windlands.
[298:30.50]Did I say wild?
[298:31.62]Oh, I said Wildlands.
[298:33.70]Windlands.
[298:36.60]There I go, adding another letter for no reason.
[298:41.34]I still have to go back and beat Jet Island.
[298:43.08]I was close.
[298:43.68]I was only like a couple hours away, wasn't I?
[298:52.50]But thank you, Grody, for the $5.
[298:55.38]And the suggestion.
[298:57.56]I want to play it all.
[298:58.32]I want to see it all.
[299:03.24]Mostly lost thanks for the 250.
[299:05.78]The stupid shit you and Stir were doing in these games reminds me of the shenanigans you two did in TF2 and it made me happy.
[299:10.42]Yeah, I mean... Like I said, anytime you get, like, a buddy together... And you just... The purpose is just to have fun.
[299:25.51]There's nothing else there.
[299:26.81]It's just... I want to do something and just have a good time.
[299:31.68]That's it.
[299:35.60]It's always a good time.
[299:38.84]You know, when stars are up.
[299:41.52]You'll see him tomorrow.
[299:44.33]I love beating people at the bar with my buddy.
[299:47.33]I love throwing glass at people's faces.
[299:49.67]You know, with my friend.
[299:51.47]Hitting guitars over people's heads.
[299:58.93]Pretending to smoke the same cigarette 30 times and burn it on someone.
[300:02.85]Yeah.
[300:07.79]But the friend, it's, come on, it's just, it's a blast.
[300:14.37]But thank you, Mostly Lost, for sure.
[300:19.13]Am I going to want other people to join us in Pavlov tomorrow?
[300:21.87]I don't know.
[300:31.33]How big are the lobbies?
[300:35.27]Is it a big lobby system?
[300:36.59]Is it like 12 players?
[300:37.67]How many players?
[300:38.13]10?
[300:39.67]Yeah, maybe we can get something going.
[300:46.40]I'll try to get one of those chat roulette system things.
[300:50.76]Maybe we'll play a handful of games with subs or something.
[300:54.22]That'll be fun.
[300:57.77]I have it if you need a sharpshooter.
[301:05.44]Really loving the VR streams, even if I don't chat a lot.
[301:09.04]I'm glad you like them.
[301:11.42]I'm going to keep doing them.
[301:13.56]I'm going to keep doing them until I am satisfied.
[301:17.03]And I'm still interested and still very satisfied, so we're going to keep going.
[301:23.69]Chat... No, like a chat...
[301:26.32]A roulette-based raffle chat system.
[301:33.27]Yeah, we'll have, we'll get something going.
[301:35.55]Hey, Novi333, thanks for the 333.
[301:37.83]$3.33.
[301:41.43]Thank you.
[301:44.69]Uh, no message?
[301:45.56]That's it?
[301:45.98]Thank you so much.
[301:49.02]Timmy Tim Tim, thanks for the 250.
[301:51.20]Can you tell the story where you ate a pack of Oreos and puked in your mother's bed?
[301:58.48]No, isn't there a clip lying around somewhere from two years ago of me doing this?
[302:04.35]And then didn't I say clip this so anytime anybody says this to just have it?
[302:09.03]I just, it's, it's somewhere.
[302:11.13]It exists.
[302:14.77]How many times have I had that clipped and said, hey, bring this up when somebody fucking comes in here and says to get the Oreos.
[302:23.19]Tell the story when you slapped yourself in the face live.
[302:25.31]What an embarrassment.
[302:41.09]But thank you.
[302:43.25]And I'm going to run the credits.
[302:44.45]We have another couple bits to do, but I'm going to preemptively get them rolling.
[302:47.19]These are all the subs and the resubs that came in today during this stream.
[302:53.26]Thank you for the continued support, everybody.
[302:54.58]It means a lot.
[302:55.46]You guys are awesome.
[302:59.70]Thank you, everybody.
[303:00.81]There are trillions of subscribers now.
[303:16.76]I have a game in VR that might be Resident Sleeper.
[303:18.86]I don't know.
[303:19.36]It's called Iron Wolf VR.
[303:22.30]That actually was on the list.
[303:23.81]We were looking at it.
[303:32.25]Please answer the question.
[303:34.44]We don't demand things from the streamer.
[303:35.76]Exquisite.
[303:55.04]I honestly only come for the end of the stream.
[303:56.82]Well... Welcome.
[303:59.58]And also goodbye.
[304:03.98]TingyHead250 here.
[304:04.56]Now I'm well aware that at least half of my emotes are dogshit.
[304:21.06]Half those planets should have been deleted three years ago.
[304:24.94]But no, I'm going to leave them.
[304:29.10]Like, Germa Mustard is what I would classify as a dogshit emote.
[304:41.89]It just is.
[304:43.67]I like it.
[304:44.15]I love all my emotes.
[304:45.57]I have a personal...
[304:48.04]Loving relationship.
[304:49.87]I have a great relationship with all my emotes.
[304:54.95]But some of them are... Uh... Thrown together, we'll say.
[305:00.55]Flustered because mustard.
[305:08.95]Like, for instance, okay, hold on.
[305:10.38]So, for instance.
[305:12.04]Uh, Jerma1guy is just a little shitty paint drawing.
[305:22.45]German Nosewipe is a terrible DAB emote.
[305:26.73]It's a DAB emote, like it's a- and it was voted because of that reason, because it's a DAB emote.
[305:35.36]German Mustard.
[305:44.04]German Moon is my first emote ever, and it's like... I was intentionally trying to have an emote that was awful.
[305:52.91]I love it, though.
[305:53.43]That's my favorite emote.
[305:56.71]This is by far my favorite emote on the site.
[306:01.13]I'm sorry, it just is.
[306:03.75]I don't think anybody has one that can compare.
[306:08.31]I'll stand on the egomaniac hill here.
[306:10.73]I love that emote.
[306:13.37]God, what a beautiful emote.
[306:16.91]I say that because it's my face.
[306:18.52]It's me.
[306:22.86]I hope you guys don't take me that seriously you definitely don't uh timmy tim ten thanks for the 250 tell the story so we can clip it was sick one day decided to eat oreos did the thing when you got up and tried to move around while being sick to your stomach got up too fast had too many oreos a whole sleeve
[306:43.31]Wanted to ask my mother a question or something.
[306:45.23]I don't know, the story's getting hazy over all these years.
[306:49.21]It was very fresh in my mind when I told it the first time.
[306:51.93]So, go up to my mother to ask a question.
[306:53.73]Get that closed in.
[306:55.26]The world's gonna fall down on top of you.
[306:57.50]Blackout feeling.
[306:59.34]Lie back in my mother's bed and throw up all over it.
[307:06.74]The whole sleeve?
[307:07.42]No, no, no.
[307:08.26]Like, one of the... It's like there's three sleeves per Oreo container.
[307:15.41]One of those sections.
[307:18.29]Probably 12 to 14 cookies.
[307:23.69]Why did you eat Oreos if you were sick?
[307:25.05]I don't know.
[307:28.25]Why does anybody ever eat Oreos?
[307:30.71]For any reason.
[307:33.09]Can you guys reliably think of a scenario where eating a bunch of Oreos is a good idea?
[307:40.15]They just taste good.
[307:41.83]And they're easy to eat.
[307:50.21]Oreos are great, fuck you.
[307:51.70]I also agree, I think Oreos are fantastic.
[307:59.62]But if, like, the light bulb goes off, like... I'm gonna eat 12 Oreos.
[308:07.24]It's never really a great idea.
[308:14.80]Oreo serving size is 3.
[308:16.93]You're eating, like, 30 times the serving size.
[308:21.28]Hey, Kirby Heart, thanks for the $4.

[308:31.03]Kirby Heart.
[308:33.95]Did you ever replace her bed after that?
[308:35.45]No, we just sprayed it with a hose and then let it dry and then flipped it over.
[308:44.08]And that's my time.
[308:52.61]That's gonna be it for me.
[309:00.35]Cliff both parts.
