[00:06.96]That's a real nice iPhone you got there.
[00:11.91]It'll look real good with your black eye.
[00:14.87]Dude, it's just a statue.
[00:17.69]Quit fucking looking at it, dickhead.
[00:20.25]Oh, is he alive too?
[00:21.29]Let's kick his ass!
[00:21.94]This guy behind me on the phone, seriously.
[00:25.28]Guy on the phone, really?
[00:35.42]Will you just shut up?
[00:36.16]Will you shut the fuck up?
[00:38.60]Yeah, you better run.
[00:40.26]I was missing you on purpose.
[00:42.40]Ladies, be careful.
[00:43.92]I heard there's a dangerous man on the loose.
[00:48.97]Who you think you fight, fool?
[00:52.21]How many people can we step on?
[00:54.23]One, two.
[00:55.33]We got three, four over here.
[00:56.85]Three, four.
[00:58.27]I see five.
[00:58.95]We can step on five people.
[01:01.11]Oops, sorry.
[01:02.92]That guy's got binoculars.
[01:04.41]I hear you can see pretty far with those.
[01:05.81]Well, can you see this?
[01:07.55]Excuse me.
[01:08.67]Oh, whoops-a-daisy.
[01:09.87]I fell over the table.
[01:11.09]I'm just such a klutz sometimes.
[01:13.73]How good is the salmon here?
[01:15.25]Oh, whoops.
[01:16.12]Oh, gee.
[01:17.62]Oh, man.
[01:18.06]Is that your friend right there?
[01:19.78]Oh, that's too bad.
[01:20.80]He's about to see a real bad day, I'll tell you right now.
[01:24.10]I ain't never seen... Psych!
[01:25.24]It was you, the hooked up!
[01:26.96]Excuse me, sir.
[01:28.43]Do you have Prince Albert in a can?
[01:32.16]I don't know what the relevance is with that.
[01:33.56]Why am I saying that?
[01:34.34]What's up, dude?
[01:38.02]What are you eating?
[01:39.16]Nah, I don't give a shit.
[01:40.30]You want to get roughed up?
[01:41.74]Is that what you want?
[01:42.24]You want to get roughed up?
[01:45.90]None of you witnesses got shit on me because he just fell over and died.
[01:49.40]I didn't even touch him.
[01:53.57]Ooh, there's my boyfriend.
[01:55.25]Not anymore.
[01:56.45]Now he's down.
[01:57.55]You know, you're not gonna stay down?
[01:59.38]Now you're down.
[02:00.70]Now you're down.
[02:01.88]Now you're down.
[02:03.48]Now you're not down?
[02:04.64]Now you're down for the count.
[02:07.02]Oh my god, this guy's Superman.
[02:09.38]Stay down.
[02:10.86]Jesus.
