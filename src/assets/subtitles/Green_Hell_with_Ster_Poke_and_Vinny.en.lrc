[ve:61.1.100]

[00:20.32]Hey, what up?
[00:24.96]How's it going?
[00:29.41]Gonna get right into it here.
[00:32.84]Playing, uh, Green Hell.
[00:38.73]Green Hell with Poke, Ster, Vinny, and Poke.
[00:50.45]This is a survival game.
[00:51.84]It's apparently pretty brutal.
[00:52.86]It's apparently hard.
[00:56.54]You can break your arm and you have to actually put a bandage on your arm.
[01:01.37]We're likely to die in the first 20 to 30 seconds of the game.
[01:06.58]I don't know.
[01:08.87]You can get eaten by a crocodile.
[01:11.03]I don't know.
[01:14.52]But what's up?
[01:20.09]They said it's a great game.
[01:24.65]It seems like it's pretty good.
[01:26.60]I've never played it before.
[01:43.81]You played Ridge Racer?
[01:47.64]uh why did I take so long to read a comment and that's the why did I take that long I've been staring at the chat for like a full minute searching for something to reply to just like you know what am I what what do I want to even reply to right now I like there's a lot there's like a lot of words here and it's like ridge racer was the easiest thing for me to read out loud it was just like alright you know what no but thanks for the comment
[02:17.17]Alright, let's check in with the boys.
[02:21.54]Uh, hello, checking in with the boys.
[02:27.07]Ah, yo.
[02:28.99]Going on, folk.
[02:31.45]Not hosting.
[02:32.96]Hey, what was that, like a ten second intro?
[02:36.12]I mean, I know you guys are ready.
[02:38.60]I'm not.
[02:40.15]He said he had to eat the snack wraps.
[02:42.51]Do ten more seconds.
[02:43.71]I don't have it yet.
[02:44.41]No, he doesn't have the snack wrap yet.
[02:47.20]That's how unready he is.
[02:49.50]He said he had to go BRB to eat the snack wrap and give us a full review.
[02:53.84]Yeah, he's he's not going.
[02:57.07]To be able to focus unless he eats the snack wrap.
[03:01.15]I must tell me please don't be high in green hell.
[03:03.33]You're going to ruin Jerma's ad.
[03:05.05]Is this an ad?
[03:06.43]No.
[03:09.24]Alright, we're back 66 years after the game comes up.
[03:14.26]Did you imagine?
[03:18.19]What if we just pretended to be sponsored one day?
[03:22.00]I feel like that's illegal.
[03:24.91]I think that might be against the law.
[03:28.01]I heard there was a trend for a while where, like, Instagram people were pretending to be sponsored by, like, prestigious brands for, like, clout.
[03:36.67]Like, oh, yeah, I'm, like, popular enough to, like, oh, Prada, like, sponsored me.
[03:40.49]For real?
[03:41.35]And then what happened?
[03:42.00]They died?
[03:42.98]don't know if they died I don't think they died like well with lawsuits it's over uh I don't know I'd have to look into it yeah I feel like if you yo Jerma Jerma what's up gg wants to say hi hi gg not to me say hi Jerma
[04:08.77]Fuck her.
[04:09.45]She's running away!
[04:10.45]Hey, GG!
[04:11.23]Hey, how are you?
[04:12.25]He's saying hi!
[04:12.99]You're being very strange!
[04:17.16]We'll have a fight about it later.
[04:18.12]Love you.
[04:18.74]Oh, okay.
[04:21.11]Alright.
[04:23.05]She got shy.
[04:23.53]She gets these, like, weird videos of you on Instagram.
[04:27.53]Yeah, fucking tell- There's a lot of strange videos of you, Jerma, out there.
[04:31.24]Fucking tell me about it, man.
[04:34.52]I get strange videos of myself.
[04:36.68]You know, I told someone... You know how fucking weird that is?
[04:40.08]I told someone I know in real life about like, oh yeah, I like streaming stuff.
[04:43.63]And then the next time I had heard them mention it, they said that, oh yeah, like I found you.
[04:47.73]I saw a one hour compilation of you making Jerma uncomfortable.
[04:51.33]And that was their introduction.
[04:55.68]That's at least... I don't know why you picked that one.
[04:57.72]That's at least a mid-level video.
[04:59.92]I don't think you start with that one.
[05:03.04]I don't think... I don't know, man.
[05:05.61]You certainly don't.
[05:09.18]Yeah, I tell you.
[05:10.40]Yeah, it is weird.
[05:11.11]It didn't on the fucking toilet.
[05:14.03]I don't know.
[05:14.95]Did they see the whole thing?
[05:16.17]It sounded like it.
[05:16.98]They sounded like they enjoyed their time.
[05:18.78]They're like, oh yeah, it was cool, man.
[05:19.96]Yeah, I saw this like, you know, hour long.
[05:23.25]I guess.
[05:24.49]Who knows?
[05:26.80]Yeah, but when I scroll through and I'm just, and I don't, guys, I don't, let me just be like, let's go up front here.
[05:34.36]I scroll TikTok or like YouTube shorts like once a month, maybe like once every three to four months.
[05:41.80]uh and but nothing will nothing will ever prepare me for uh like Jerma rants about chicken sandwiches and it's just like I don't want to see this like I don't get get away from me I don't want to see I don't recommend this content don't recommend this content to me I don't want to see this that guy's like so full of himself Jerma alien rant I get the off of my feed I don't want to see this
[06:10.71]Your algorithms have ruined.
[06:20.82]But so are we going to do the who's hosting?
[06:24.26]I said not it.
[06:26.59]You were the last.
[06:28.01]No, I was the first one that said it.
[06:29.71]It was poked.
[06:30.09]That was last episode.
[06:30.95]That's confirmable.
[06:33.29]But Vinny's muted.
[06:34.73]I'll I'll host it.
[06:36.00]That's true.
[06:36.42]Vinny is muted.
[06:39.18]I'll be the alpha dog.
[06:41.57]I'll have you all bow down to my prowess like whatever how come no one wants to be big dog nowadays everyone's just happy being a little pup ever since the the peak hackers I'm scared
[07:02.94]So did you guys want to do?
[07:04.70]I know Ster said we should do it, but I don't know.
[07:06.72]Like there's a survival mode and there is a story mode.
[07:10.92]I don't know if story mode might take a little longer to do anything or if survival just has everything.
[07:16.97]Did you guys do the tutorial?
[07:17.91]By the way, this game is fucking hard.
[07:20.21]I hope I didn't.
[07:20.99]OK, the game is very.
[07:22.07]This game is hard.
[07:24.28]And it out.
[07:25.36]It needs brainpower like a lot of brainpower to do this.
[07:29.16]Just to let you know.
[07:31.37]I don't go camping and shit, so... Yeah, if you fall down off a ledge a little bit, you... Bro.
[07:40.34]It's over.
[07:40.90]We have to bandage your leg or you die.
[07:44.22]Cut off my leg.
[07:46.53]You might even be able to do that.
[07:47.47]I don't know.
[07:56.50]Hello.
[07:57.26]Sorry.
[07:57.84]Hey!
[07:58.86]Hello.
[08:00.78]Alright.
[08:03.11]What up?
[08:04.60]My game is having weird issues capturing.
[08:09.21]Game capture doesn't work?
[08:11.20]It's just the frame rates are weird.
[08:14.40]You guys having that issue or no?
[08:16.40]No, we're on OBS, not XSplit.
[08:19.67]I can't do OBS right now.
[08:22.99]The XSplit.
[08:25.10]Dude, SEGA versus Nintendo.
[08:28.66]XSplit versus OBS, except it's like the SEGA 32X versus the N64.
[08:33.75]Man, I get this a lot.
[08:36.51]Trust me.
[08:37.28]Vinny, you're on the 32X right now.
[08:39.65]I know.
[08:40.61]I know.
[08:41.23]The Jaguar.
[08:44.35]Oh, oh, okay.
[08:45.52]V-Sync worked.
[08:46.30]Okay, we're good.
[08:47.36]Oh, hell yeah.
[08:47.68]Hi, everyone.
[08:48.78]What's going on, dude?
[08:50.70]Yo.
[08:50.78]Hi.
[08:50.94]So, Ster, you ready to do some game invites?
[08:54.49]Oh, yeah.
[08:54.85]We're doing story?
[08:56.31]I mean, I guess so.
[08:59.64]Do I have to do the tutorial?
[09:01.72]Is survival or story better?
[09:03.88]Any green hell people?
[09:05.52]Yeah, what's better?
[09:06.62]Has anyone played this, or is there one guy, like the XSplit guy on Twitch?
[09:12.81]One guy's in all caps.
[09:13.99]Survival.
[09:14.61]I'm seeing survival, survival.
[09:15.83]Story is good.
[09:16.51]Survival, survival, survival, survival.
[09:18.82]Survival has the whole map unlocked.
[09:21.60]Okay, but you guys saying survival, you know that we're only going to play for like 15 minutes, right?
[09:26.09]What?
[09:27.83]This isn't like a full survival, like, town building.
[09:31.20]We might do a little bit.
[09:34.05]I would say survival if everyone's saying it's good.
[09:40.20]And then if we don't like it, we do story?
[09:42.82]What about survival and going on a hike?
[09:44.15]Do story or you will die instantly.
[09:46.73]Do we go on survival or whoever dies first?
[09:49.07]I'm burying a machete in the back of somebody's head in the first 10 seconds and we're going to have to restart the game anyways.
[09:54.98]So let's just do survival.
[09:59.26]Survival hardest mode.
[10:01.43]Survival.
[10:02.11]Don't do that.
[10:03.61]Warning.
[10:04.11]We recommend starting green hell with story.
[10:06.57]Well, you'll be acquainted with basic.
[10:08.22]Nah.
[10:10.02]Nah.
[10:13.59]We actually are not going to know anything.
[10:15.17]Maybe we should do story.
[10:17.27]I mean, it wasn't the whole point that we don't know anything.
[10:20.91]But for this game, I don't.
[10:22.19]We're gamers.
[10:23.46]Our collective game experience is like 130 years.
[10:26.88]We got this.
[10:27.78]That's true.
[10:29.66]That's true.
[10:30.16]That's true.
[10:30.70]There's three difficulty levels.
[10:34.87]Uh-huh.
[10:35.37]What are they?
[10:37.61]What is it?
[10:39.69]They've got the longest names.
[10:41.33]Welcome to the jungle is the medium difficulty.
[10:46.30]Okay.
[10:46.92]I'm so sorry, but you guys see the... Never mind.
[10:49.30]Never mind.
[10:50.26]Oh, it's snack wrap time.
[10:52.16]There's a dick and balls on the main menu.
[10:54.66]I was just thinking that poke.
[10:56.13]Wait, there's a dick?
[10:57.35]I was like, there's no way that's what he's talking about.
[10:59.93]Yes.
[11:03.66]You talking about this?
[11:07.38]The sticks and the two balls right there on the left.
[11:09.46]You think that's a dick and balls?
[11:11.85]They know what they're doing.
[11:12.97]In some cultures.
[11:14.27]You think that they put that there and they're like, yeah, someone's going to say that.
[11:18.89]Yeah.
[11:20.90]viral clicks alright I think start us at the normal difficulty don't do the hard stuff if because then he's gonna trip and then he's gonna fall and hit you and with you you're both gonna die and then me and poke are not gonna know what to do why am I why am I gonna trip is it because of that anvil thing that happened I just picked a random person you were the closest the anvil I know I got I I know
[11:51.52]Is the screen frozen?
[11:53.12]Oh yeah, I guess it is.
[11:54.98]It's a pretty good fire right there.
[11:56.86]This game does not want me to have an easy time.
[11:59.19]So while I was waiting for you guys to join and then send the invites, my character's starving and I'm dead.
[12:05.47]What?
[12:06.31]Wait, what?
[12:07.68]It's been all of two minutes.
[12:12.22]You're dead.
[12:12.48]Okay.

[13:02.45]I would.

[13:54.95]Alright, well, there's already a fucking animal over there.
[13:58.86]Oh, let's kill it.
[13:59.74]No, no, no.
[14:00.34]That could be a friendly animal.
[14:01.46]Don't kill that.
[14:02.81]Wait, I want to see.
[14:08.05]It's green.
[14:09.16]What are these?
[14:10.12]Green hell.
[14:11.40]Alright, alright.
[14:12.02]Hey, we have to, like, eat.
[14:13.46]Okay, let me give you a quick tutorial.
[14:16.03]Hold F. F is your watch.
[14:18.74]Your watch has hunger, thirst, sanity, and poison.
[14:24.82]I don't know.
[14:26.12]Hold C. God, I wish I had that in real life.
[14:28.21]Everybody hold C. You have a crafting menu.
[14:31.07]You have a backpack.
[14:32.51]Crafting menu opens up your backpack.
[14:34.23]Tab is also your backpack.
[14:35.79]Don't ask me why I'm the one teaching everybody this, but I am.
[14:38.70]Have you played this?
[14:40.26]Literally for like 10 minutes before we started.
[14:43.56]Oh.
[14:44.11]So we have to make a fire.
[14:45.86]We need sticks.
[14:47.18]Then you turn the sticks.
[14:48.56]You put it up here.
[14:49.90]A small stick and a plank can make like a fire starter.
[14:54.19]We'll figure it out.
[14:55.47]We're going camping with the boys.
[14:56.51]That's what's happening.
[14:57.52]Also, if you scroll wheel while F is open, it shows time.
[15:00.90]It shows direction.
[15:02.12]So we need to find food.
[15:03.87]Get the fuck out of here.
[15:06.01]What are you doing?
[15:07.42]What do I look like, Ster?
[15:10.96]I just realized.
[15:12.12]You look like a young, generic man.
[15:15.93]Just like real life.
[15:17.63]Yeah.
[15:18.35]Alright.
[15:18.53]You look like the default Sim.
[15:21.54]What do I look like?
[15:22.28]Ster looks like Ster.
[15:23.70]You look like a bald biker, kind of, almost.
[15:25.98]We gotta find... We are starving.
[15:30.19]So, collect sticks.
[15:30.87]Well, there's animals here.
[15:32.98]Yo, I'm punching an ant-eater.
[15:34.38]What are you doing?
[15:37.91]We gotta eat!
[15:38.31]Are we supposed to kill it?
[15:40.09]You're almost dead!
[15:41.35]It's a skunk, dude!
[15:43.92]It's not even an ant-eater!
[15:45.28]Don't kill the skunk!
[15:46.76]Don't kill the skunk!
[15:48.82]I'm hungry!
[15:49.48]Don't kill the skunk!
[15:51.65]This is just a walk-in snack wrap.
[15:55.39]You died already!
[15:57.50]Vinny's already dead!
[15:58.72]Why does it say vomit it zero times when you die?
[16:02.44]Oh.
[16:03.02]Oh, you got it!
[16:05.11]Yo, the at-eater's dead.
[16:06.85]We need a blade to cut it open.
[16:10.09]Should we restart?
[16:10.95]No, no, no, I'm here.
[16:12.06]I told you this was gonna happen.
[16:14.50]Tenderize, tenderize.
[16:15.92]A walking snack wrap.
[16:18.95]Wait, I'm leveling up my fists like this.
[16:21.07]Wait, really?
[16:21.61]Oh, I'm gonna do that.
[16:23.35]Fist plus one.
[16:25.95]Alright, can we please at least have a little bit of goddamn dignity and respect?
[16:29.92]And get a blade and then do this correctly?
[16:32.90]Alright, Jermo.
[16:34.79]Uh... Oh, fuck!
[16:36.39]Free food over here, boys!
[16:37.63]Oh, there's maggots on it!
[16:42.84]Oh, ugh!
[16:46.05]Can you... I just harvested a bone and made a... Oh, I found a... I got a bone.
[16:53.10]...bone needle.
[16:53.86]Uh, armadillo.
[16:55.01]It became a rock.
[16:55.85]Uh, press N, by the way.
[16:57.77]Uh, N. Guys, I'm bleeding to death.
[16:59.87]Guys, I'm bleeding.
[17:01.10]What's your recipe?
[17:03.30]I don't know.
[17:05.78]Did you slit your leg?
[17:06.38]I'm gonna find out how to save you.
[17:08.31]No, I'm gonna find some fibers from the trees, and I'm gonna, uh, cauterize the wound.
[17:12.27]Here, eat some bugs.
[17:13.09]You'll feel better.
[17:14.52]I have a small stick.
[17:15.66]It's not me.
[17:17.02]Wait, hold on.
[17:17.70]Guys, my time on this Earth is limited.
[17:20.16]No, you'll be fine, sir.
[17:21.13]We gotcha.
[17:21.77]I didn't like that, apparently.
[17:23.28]Oh my god, I just fell asleep.
[17:27.16]You fell asleep?
[17:29.13]Against your will?
[17:31.41]I'm sorry.
[17:33.45]That hurt my head.
[17:34.24]Alright, we need to make stuff.
[17:37.58]Hit N to go to... I'm dying.
[17:40.65]How do I trade?
[17:41.29]Take a few bugs.
[17:42.53]Here.
[17:43.68]I'm going through my book.
[17:44.96]I don't see a bandage.
[17:46.36]Eat that bug that I dropped on the ground.
[17:47.73]Let's just punch him in the head and respawn.
[17:49.99]Vinny, respond.
[17:51.15]Eat this.
[17:51.59]Yeah, you respawn, but only half health and half energy.
[17:54.36]I'm going to do it.
[17:55.44]Quick, eat it.
[17:56.88]Wait.
[17:57.64]In three, two, one.
[18:03.97]Will you eat this bug already?
[18:05.81]You fucking idiot.

[30:39.69]No, this is awful.
[30:40.59]If this was real life, man, this would be a huge problem.
[30:43.78]The fire's already out.
[30:49.06]Do I need to drink?
[30:51.20]Is this okay?
[30:52.16]Can we drink out of this?
[30:53.86]Yeah, you lose a little bit of sanity, and I think you could probably get sick from it, but it's worth it.
[31:06.82]Vinny, your health is degrading.

[31:53.30]You're just letting me sit in the fire.

[32:03.55]We need like a shelter.
[32:05.39]How do we build a shelter?
[32:08.69]Uh, let me consult my crudely drawn notes.

[39:26.77]I got a knife.
[39:28.62]It's alright.
[39:29.20]I think he just got swarmed by bees.
[39:31.49]I'm getting swarmed by bees.
[39:35.05]No wonder this base was abandoned.
[39:36.35]Holy shit, it sucks here.
[39:37.78]I'm gonna die.
[39:40.56]This is so ridiculous.
[39:46.35]A bag of nuts!
[39:49.05]Really?
[39:49.57]I have no idea what's going on.
[39:51.11]I don't even know how to eat it.
[39:52.54]I still think we should sleep and make it day, because it's so dark.
[39:55.26]I agree.
[39:58.37]Alright, I'll sleep right here.
[40:00.12]I'm sleeping on the floor.
[40:00.96]Oh shit.

[40:02.48]Everyone hold C. Everyone hold C and sleep.
[40:07.78]Hold on.
[40:08.18]I'm trying to eat this.
[40:09.17]I don't know how to eat it.
[40:11.77]We're all waiting on you.
[40:13.07]I don't... I'm gonna die in my sleep.
[40:17.05]If I fucking go to bed.
[40:18.26]This is my last moment on Earth.
[40:20.34]Wake us up in two seconds, Sturz.
[40:21.56]Wake us up in two seconds.
[40:22.22]Okay, I know.
[40:22.72]I'm finding a bed.
[40:24.23]Calm down.
[40:25.01]On the floor, on the floor.
[40:25.95]You've been eating a fucking snack all day.
[40:28.57]I'm eating fries.
[40:34.08]Oh, three of four sleeping.
[40:35.18]Okay, so it wasn't even me.
[40:36.56]God, I'm thirsty.
[40:37.27]No, it woke me up.
[40:38.19]I'm so thirsty.
[40:39.67]I went back to bed.
[40:41.23]I don't want to drink that water because it made me see guys with fucking... Wait, there is... He's still here.
[40:45.88]I'm not going to... I'm going the other way.
[40:48.38]Can we kill?
[40:50.18]I don't think we ever slept.

[41:25.17]Like, you can't... I'm going to die in my sleep.
[41:34.65]It says, eat something rich in fats like nuts.
[41:38.36]That was the tool tip I just got.
[41:40.68]This game hates me.
[41:42.00]Game time will speed up only if all players go to sleep.
[41:45.71]Everyone get in bed.
[41:48.33]You're yelling at me to do it, and you guys aren't even doing it.
[41:50.17]It keeps waking me up!
[41:50.97]It keeps waking me up!
[41:52.31]Because we all have to go to sleep at the same time.
[41:55.70]Otherwise, if that bar fills... I died!
[42:04.01]I'm about to wake up and die.
[42:07.59]We can't sleep!
[42:12.13]Stop eating everything.
[42:22.86]I'm already back.
[42:24.76]I'm eating.
[42:25.98]Yeah, I'm right here.
[42:26.82]I spawned on my mattress I guess.
[42:29.27]Do we have any food?
[42:31.49]Can I eat something?
[42:32.17]I ate like one apple and that's all we had.
[42:34.91]You want a nut?
[42:35.84]I want anything.
[42:37.40]Eat something rich in fats, like nuts.
[42:39.93]Yeah, I thought- Oh, nice.
[42:41.69]I'll take that unknown nut.
[42:49.00]Mmm.
[42:49.10]There's a microbe.
[42:50.40]My character is an alcoholic.
[42:52.47]Just keeps saying, God, I could use a drink.
[42:54.35]Like, now?
[42:56.53]We need to make clean water or get a clean water source.
[43:00.70]And we need light.
[43:01.52]I can't see anything.
[43:02.60]Orange juice!
[43:03.00]What?
[43:03.12]Orange juice?
[43:04.57]Orange juice?
[43:06.48]Yep.
[43:08.56]Who wants it?
[43:10.55]Here, I'm dropping it on the floor.
[43:12.87]And a can of food.
[43:14.30]Alright.
[43:16.30]Awesome.
[43:17.80]I think there's drugs in here, too.
[43:21.51]Fuck!
[43:21.99]I ate the orange juice and it crunched.
[43:28.42]Who is this guy?
[43:30.48]Vinny, why are you and I the only guy?
[43:33.40]Can anybody else see this guy?
[43:35.08]No, I don't know what you guys ate.
[43:40.09]I got him.
[43:40.47]I got him.
[43:40.75]I got him.
[43:41.73]I got him.
[43:42.41]What the fuck?
[43:44.76]I got him.
[43:46.32]His body just appeared in front of us.
[43:49.00]I'm harvesting him.
[43:50.58]Is there any money or anything on him?
[43:51.90]I'm harvesting him.
[43:53.22]Is that what I think it is?
[43:57.10]Wait, what do you mean harvesting him?
[44:00.73]What?
[44:02.11]Are you eating him?
[44:03.49]I have human meat and bones now.
[44:06.50]What?
[44:08.10]Would anyone like some human meat?
[44:09.66]Are we going to eat a human?
[44:12.19]Yeah, we should make a campfire.
[44:13.31]Let's do it.
[44:14.49]There's a little stove here.
[44:16.25]I don't know if we could make a fire under it.
[44:19.42]Guys, I got a fucking spear.
[44:21.56]Oh, wow.
[44:22.26]We now have to take this seriously.
[44:30.18]How do you use the crafting?
[44:32.58]Hold C, craft, and then you drag an item onto the rock, and you have to combine items on the rock.
[44:39.65]Or, I think in your notepad, if you click the thing, you can place it unbuilt in the world.
[44:45.80]Yeah, I'm... We need water.
[44:49.17]Water.
[44:49.75]What about, like, torches?
[44:50.65]We need to make, like, torches and...
[44:55.07]How do you make a torch?
[44:56.71]Stick and rope for torch.
[44:57.89]I'm gonna kill this- I'm gonna kill this... ...atlion.
[45:01.78]Okay, cuz we- we probably need to eat it.
[45:05.83]I got bugs all over me!
[45:08.63]Don't lose the spear.
[45:15.30]Oh my god.
[45:18.37]The hell did I see at the campfire?
[45:23.35]Yeah, campfire is, I think you just drag it out from the menu.
[45:29.06]Guys, I lost the fight to a predator.
[45:33.06]I killed by a predator.
[45:34.83]I saw it in the notebook before.
[45:36.31]Oh, I got it.
[45:41.39]Stone blade Vinny.
[45:47.12]Okay.
[45:47.72]Where's the spear that you had?
[45:50.48]Could do it somewhere with a roof.
[45:54.49]How do you do a stone blade, chat?
[45:56.65]I don't think I have it.
[45:57.91]No.
[46:00.58]Did the atlion take it and run?
[46:02.12]I don't know.
[46:02.62]I don't see it anywhere.
[46:05.40]Stone times two.
[46:07.12]Oh, I missed it.
[46:08.54]Ow.
[46:09.03]That's the same one.
[46:09.67]It's hitting me.
[46:10.81]It remembered my face.
[46:18.11]It was like a cat.
[46:20.10]Who's got sticks?
[46:21.58]I got one stick, sir.
[46:22.66]Do you need that?
[46:23.56]It's a giant cat.
[46:24.28]I need all sticks.
[46:25.98]Alright.
[46:26.73]Find me where the microwave is.
[46:30.05]Over here.
[46:30.43]I'm trying to make the microwave, but I need sticks.
[46:34.84]Come to me.
[46:37.00]I'm in a fucking jungle and I can't find sticks?
[46:40.27]I dropped one right here.
[46:42.31]Yeah, there's an arrow here, too.
[46:44.29]We don't need those, though.
[46:46.77]I need like 12 and you're like, here's one.
[46:49.34]I have one.
[46:50.42]I can't conjure sticks.
[46:53.31]What are we in?
[46:54.36]Like they grow on trees.
[46:56.23]This is how people... This is how you don't survive.
[46:58.42]We need to be together.
[46:59.98]We need to be working together.
[47:01.74]My eyes hurt from looking at the dark screen.
[47:05.92]I'm squinting.
[47:06.69]So let's work together.
[47:08.07]Let's put our four big boy brains together.
[47:11.55]And let's get fire.
[47:12.57]Let's put our goddamn sticks together.
[47:14.36]How about that?
[47:15.64]That is probably what we should do.
[47:18.72]How is it still dark?
[47:20.78]Didn't we sleep like four times?
[47:22.31]Well, you... Who has sticks?
[47:24.23]I...
[47:26.07]Yeah, should we sleep again?
[47:27.53]I hear something.
[47:28.19]Ster, I have a long stick over here.
[47:31.23]What is that, a snake?
[47:32.99]Oh my god, my fucking eyes, man.
[47:34.14]Okay, now you have several sticks right here.
[47:36.34]Ster, four sticks, buddy.
[47:37.64]I'm gonna pull these out of my sockets.
[47:39.18]I got a big stick.
[47:40.02]Big stick.
[47:42.08]Right here, pal.
[47:43.36]There's a snake down there.
[47:44.63]I heard a snake.
[47:45.27]Big stick.
[47:47.19]I'll grab them and I'll drop them up here so we'll all work together.
[47:50.57]Everybody up here.
[47:51.37]Everyone up here.
[47:52.23]Here's the plan.
[47:53.70]You see right here?
[47:55.24]Campfire.
[47:58.16]We're trying to construct this.
[47:59.45]One of six sticks.
[48:01.33]Yes.
[48:01.85]Objective.
[48:05.95]I should have one, right?
[48:07.06]I think they need to be small sticks.
[48:08.54]Yeah, they have to be small.
[48:09.98]You have to break them up.
[48:13.22]Break them up.
[48:14.04]Harvest them.
[48:15.19]How do you break them?
[48:16.09]Right click, harvest.
[48:20.25]Harvesting sticks.
[48:23.00]Yeah.
[48:24.72]Ster, check this out.
[48:27.85]Look at all that.
[48:29.97]Hey, it's getting to be at least daytime.
[48:32.23]I'm so.
[48:34.74]How do you make a fire like on a torch, not a campfire?
[48:38.24]Does anyone know chat chat maybe?
[48:41.65]I saw it in here.
[48:45.57]We need one more regular stick.
[48:49.50]Rub two sticks.
[48:50.76]Oh, a stick and a rope is a torch.
[48:52.96]Yeah, we also- I got the torch, I just don't know how to light it.
[48:55.06]We need a plank.
[48:56.31]You need to make a hand drill.
[48:56.93]Well, let's make this fire.
[48:58.47]So you need a hand drill.
[48:59.17]We need a hand drill to go with this.
[49:01.31]So hand- Is that- That weird possum or whatever it is, is at the base.
[49:05.94]Be careful.
[49:06.42]There's parrots.
[49:09.78]They're pretty cool.
[49:11.23]So, uh, hand stick or hand drill.
[49:14.95]We need one stick.
[49:17.24]uh let's go here watch this I have a knife I have a stone knife I'm just gonna yeah yeah chop a tree down I got a stick how the heck do you do the hand drill if you have two there's like seven types of sticks Ster right here two sticks you need a small stick and a plank a wooden plank you get a wooden plank by chopping trees down
[49:47.09]So cut down a bunch of trees till we get planks.
[49:48.77]Then you take a plank and a small stick.
[49:50.20]How do you make a blade?
[49:51.58]I'm very confused.
[49:52.38]This is a stick and it needs a stick.
[49:54.00]Two stone.
[49:54.64]Two stone.
[49:54.88]Here.
[49:55.00]Look, guys.
[49:55.50]I'm going to drop some stone for you.
[49:57.40]Alright?
[49:58.36]Do two stone and you get a blade.
[50:01.01]Two stone is how much I weigh.
[50:03.81]Oh, that's a British joke.
[50:13.48]What's with these fucking sticks?
[50:17.87]This thing needs a stick, but not a small stick.
[50:20.24]But I just had a stick and it didn't let me put a stick here.
[50:22.74]It's in use.
[50:24.22]There you go.
[50:25.42]I did it.
[50:25.88]You did like aim at a different spot.
[50:30.61]Okay.
[50:30.83]Well, this thing is made out of a bunch of planks.
[50:32.87]Jerma, grab one of these planks.
[50:35.56]Plank?
[50:36.38]I need more stone.
[50:38.48]These ones aren't real.
[50:40.67]It's alright, we can just- What do you mean they're not real?
[50:42.25]Just cut a tree down.
[50:43.27]Cut this tree down.
[50:43.86]Can you hallucinate resources in this game?
[50:46.16]The Sith- I hear Sith talking to me.
[50:49.28]Don't trust anything I say from this point forward.
[50:52.05]That's from a Jedi.
[50:53.05]Alright, there should be a- a logs and pl- oh god dammit.
[50:56.95]Alright.
[50:57.13]Log.
[50:58.06]We should be able to turn log- we're looking for a plank.
[51:01.44]I need stones.
[51:02.52]Harvest the log.
[51:05.25]Bingo.
[51:05.83]I got a plank.
[51:06.89]Follow me.
[51:07.39]You following?
[51:08.27]AH!
[51:09.88]Okay, so.
[51:11.10]Blast.
[51:12.16]Crafting.
[51:15.31]We do.
[51:16.45]Blank.
[51:18.25]And a small stick.
[51:19.96]That gives you a hand drill.
[51:21.96]Then after hand drill, you need... And it's... Why is it raining every time we decide to do a campfire?
[51:29.15]Oh, okay.
[51:31.03]Alright, alright, alright.
[51:33.64]I need dry leaves, or a bird's nest, or...
[51:39.43]Who cares?
[51:40.03]He'll be alright.
[51:41.07]Harvest him.
[51:41.51]Yeah, just light this fire.
[51:43.97]Use my bones.
[51:44.83]We need dry leaves.
[51:49.30]Dry leaves or a bird's nest.
[51:50.98]Where's Poke?
[51:52.36]I'm here.
[51:52.64]I'm just looking for stones and stuff.
[51:54.57]Yeah, Poke, you found a bird's nest.
[51:56.41]We need that.
[51:58.03]I have charcoal.
[52:00.99]Maybe that'll work.
[52:02.10]I have human bones and flesh.
[52:05.62]Maybe this dried flower will work.
[52:12.79]I got a larva.
[52:15.67]Just, I don't know.
[52:17.54]Could use it for something.
[52:18.46]Maybe we eat it.
[52:20.38]Oh shit.
[52:22.40]I'm about to die.
[52:24.85]And it's all Jerma's fault.
[52:26.31]Stop!
[52:30.71]It's not teamwork, dude.
[52:32.00]I'm looking for something I can burn.
[52:33.46]My character's just like walking around remembering like Lord of the Rings quotes.
[52:40.85]I might have found some shit we can burn right here.
[52:43.62]what constitutes a dry leaf wouldn't all the leaves be wet now because it's raining yeah we're we're not going to find anything dry here how do you find rope rope is on trees certain trees have rope that's that's not too hard to find uh cut down brown palm trees or let regular leaves sit and dry
[53:11.60]So, small leaf pile.
[53:12.82]Maybe I could just put them over here.
[53:17.73]We should go camping.
[53:20.65]Like, in real life?
[53:21.69]Yeah, I feel like we could do great.
[53:23.46]That would be kind of fun.
[53:27.22]I know we should do some research on the different types of sticks.
[53:30.67]If we camp, we should do so near a public restroom, though.
[53:33.87]Wait, did I just get a parasite while sleeping?
[53:35.79]Like, something just crawled in my mouth.
[53:37.82]I thought you were going to say public restaurant.
[53:39.68]I
[53:41.10]sure did you ever see Jerma do you ever see the guy who does the stealth camping no on youtube he there's like a couple guys that do it now but this one guy he he camped outside of a McDonald's like drive-through what like it's yeah and like a roundabout in Canada he like was camping I saw that guy it's very depressing too it's a little depressing actually yeah I did just get a torch a weak torch
[54:10.53]Where'd it go?
[54:16.34]Alright, are these dry?
[54:17.14]Oh, I have no space the whole time.
[54:20.22]Let me see.
[54:25.33]Let me try this now.
[54:30.41]I've got lots of resources if needed.
[54:32.36]I don't know what we're gonna do with them, but... So these aren't dry yet, technically.
[54:38.00]Okay.
[54:42.51]It takes 12 in-game hours to dry leaves.
[54:45.71]We need brown palm trees, apparently.
[54:51.44]You see a brown palm tree?
[54:54.18]Finally, it's light out.
[54:55.76]Alright, we should be able to get it from this.
[54:57.81]We're right next to, like, a toxic waste dump site.
[55:02.23]Here we go.
[55:04.48]Whoa.
[55:05.22]That thing just spun.
[55:06.92]Yeah, logs.
[55:07.54]We got logs.
[55:08.52]Logs, but... I think we need the palm leaves.
[55:12.61]Ah, the leaves, yes.
[55:16.01]All the leaves are brown.
[55:17.90]We need brown palm leaves.
[55:19.48]Apparently these won't work.
[55:22.98]Well, I'm colorblind, so good luck, guys.
[55:24.21]You do that.
[55:26.13]No, we can't do it like that.
[55:28.97]Guys, I think this is a rain filter.
[55:30.75]This is like a rain siphon.
[55:32.76]We need to put a bowl under it or something.
[55:34.58]Alright, here.
[55:35.78]Everybody go to sleep.
[55:37.24]Oh, that sucks that we have to sleep.
[55:38.54]It's daytime.
[55:39.48]I know.
[55:40.37]It's daytime.
[55:41.01]We need dry leaves.
[55:43.15]What about bird nest?
[55:44.00]Bird nest is perfect.
[55:45.62]There's a lot of birds around here and I'm looking for a bird's nest.
[55:48.40]I got one.
[55:49.56]Give it to me right now and we're good.
[55:50.82]Every time we hit a road, like a stop sign, you can't just say go to bed.
[55:55.31]Come to the fire?
[55:57.19]It'll be fixed when we wake up.
[55:59.04]Are we sleeping?
[56:01.14]No, we don't need to sleep.
[56:02.92]So... Use tool to create ember.
[56:07.77]Yeah, I have it.
[56:09.61]Okay, I'm going to drop the bird nest.
[56:12.67]Oh, I just did something crazy.
[56:13.91]I got logs.
[56:15.53]Hell yeah.
[56:17.31]Okay, so then now I can do this.
[56:21.64]And this should work now as I go here.
[56:26.70]Log champ.
[56:27.82]Where is the bird nest?
[56:29.70]Oh, there it is.
[56:30.10]That's a major log champ moment right there.
[56:32.73]Right there's the logs right next to you guys.
[56:34.35]Oh, right here, Jerm.
[56:35.39]On the floor here.
[56:36.13]Oh, I got it, I got it.
[56:39.45]Okay.
[56:41.42]Why are there so many damn birds?
[56:42.69]There's a lot of parrots.
[56:44.45]Is it like toxic waste they're drawn to?
[56:46.19]I don't know.
[56:48.87]I got a parrot body.
[56:51.56]You're scavengering it all over.
[56:53.00]I apparently wasn't good enough to do it.
[56:54.50]I need another bird nest.
[56:55.92]Oh, no, I don't.
[56:56.68]Fuck.
[56:57.62]Oh.
[57:00.37]Where are you finding birds nests?
[57:02.83]I found one on a log stump.
[57:06.95]My guy sucks at this.
[57:12.37]I can give you bones Hold on I don't have enough stamina to do this?
[57:23.00]Vinny, take this.
[57:26.81]And then take the bird's nest.
[57:29.37]And then in your inventory, right click on the hand drill.
[57:33.92]It's like the little plank.
[57:35.00]Say use.
[57:36.50]Then drag the, right underneath, that's the fiber, the bird's nest fiber.
[57:40.31]Drag the bird's nest fiber onto your hands.
[57:42.33]There's a little circle for it.
[57:43.76]And then light the fire after you get it to work.
[57:46.86]Where's the bird nest?
[57:48.20]It should be right underneath the plank.
[57:55.98]I don't see it uh in where the plank is where the hand drill is it should be right underneath it as like a tuft of hair uh yeah it's it's not it's not there it's not there no like like I think it just despawned okay I don't do you see it I I don't see it no I found uh
[58:24.29]bottom up for the screen do we need fiber yeah if yes I would fiber definitely give Vinny the fiber he needs to make the uh fire um fiber is the hand drill supposed to be invisible it is supposed to be very visible it is a it's in your backpack the last slot tab the backpack last slot with the campfire it should be the log on it should be right on the right side thirsty okay I've got the fiber one bars
[58:52.10]And you should be able to right-click it and use it.
[58:54.05]And then the bird's nest should be in that little belt slot right at the bottom.
[58:59.73]I don't know where my fiber is.
[59:01.52]So it's bugged.
[59:03.26]Okay.
[59:04.76]We need... I'm dropping on the ground fiber.
[59:06.78]I think I dropped three here.
[59:10.01]Okay, I got fiber.
[59:11.87]Okay, so hand drill.
[59:13.59]Yep.
[59:14.73]And then one more time, Jerma, because my hand drill's bugged.
[59:17.42]Okay, you right click hand drill, hit use, you'll crouch, you'll sit down, and then drag the fiber onto that part where your hands are.
[59:27.51]There's a little circle where you can put it.
[59:29.57]Yeah.
[59:30.11]And then let it go, and then you should do it.
[59:35.34]It's taken us three days to make a fire.
[59:39.14]How do you do it?
[59:41.24]You're too tired to start a fire.
[59:44.23]Did you see this?
[59:50.64]What's it called for you?
[59:52.12]Uh, that is called an unknown fruit.
[59:54.80]Oh.
[59:55.43]You can name your own fruits.
[59:58.23]Vinny, are you- I'm sleeping so I can make a fire.
[60:02.13]Oh, okay.
[60:03.10]You can name the fruit?
[60:06.14]That's cool.
[60:07.42]Vinefruit.
[60:08.46]You don't see this?
[60:08.94]It's called a yo.
[60:10.72]no it just looks like a big cucumber pick it up apparently sleeping for six minutes is all we need it says in use got it alright so now press e when you stand up press e on the fire we'll get a fire oh wait yeah I have a bunch of meat how do I put it on the fire okay so you gotta drag the meat from your inventory to one of those little circles
[60:41.99]cooking some mushrooms but you probably want to cook meat it's probably better is it in the right spot what are you doing Jerm he's cooking human meat that's not don't put that on there it is don't don't put that on I don't want to smell that oh I don't want to know because what if the smell is so alluring
[61:08.42]And I chase that high forever.
[61:10.46]I don't even want to know.
[61:12.37]I don't want to know.
[61:13.65]Are we sure this is cooking?
[61:15.07]I don't think this is cooking.
[61:16.71]Drop the meat on it.
[61:21.70]This is all raw.
[61:26.02]Did you expect it to cook in like three seconds?
[61:28.87]No patience?
[61:29.97]I don't think it's in the right spot.
[61:33.80]No, I don't think it's cooking because that one has a thing on it.
[61:36.80]Yeah, it needs to, like, fill that slot.
[61:40.43]When it says in use, does it mean you're just looking at it?
[61:42.75]I think that means somebody is using it.
[61:44.56]Somebody's looking at it, maybe.
[61:46.24]I tripped on it.
[61:48.12]What, you died?
[61:48.74]I'm about to explode with loot.
[61:51.11]Oh, my God.
[61:52.77]How'd you die, Ster?
[61:53.75]I tripped on it.
[61:57.52]Dude, I'm taking all this fucking spruits.
[61:59.38]I had so much stuff.
[62:05.78]You alright?
[62:09.93]Yeah.
[62:10.05]Hey there, guys.
[62:11.11]You guys are stuck out here, too?
[62:13.01]Yeah, I've been stuck out here for three minutes.
[62:17.84]Hey, there we go.
[62:18.50]I know how to do it now.
[62:19.40]This fucking bit is killing me.
[62:21.41]How do you do it?
[62:21.89]You have to stick it on the slot.
[62:23.85]There's a circle that you can put it on.
[62:25.19]You can only do two at a time, it seems like.
[62:27.68]Does anyone here have bone?
[62:29.46]Oh, I need a bone.
[62:30.45]I need to... So when you have like a worm, you use a bone needle to pop your worm.
[62:35.43]Oh, that's gross sounding.
[62:36.63]But yeah, that's... Yeah.
[62:40.28]Oh.
[62:40.42]Yeah, I'm going to do that.
[62:42.82]I'll let you know how it goes.
[62:45.46]Don't punch me.
[62:48.91]Is the meat cooking?
[62:50.49]Apparently.
[62:55.45]Meat caveman.
[62:57.52]Me cook meat.
[63:00.22]Who's eating the human meat?
[63:02.08]I'll do it.
[63:02.83]Somebody... We need to feed the fire.
[63:08.47]What happened?
[63:08.81]We gotta feed the fire more water.
[63:10.54]I don't know.
[63:11.14]I died.
[63:12.76]You passed out.
[63:16.41]What the fuck?
[63:16.77]We need to feed logs, I think, into the fire.
[63:19.57]That I'm hearing.
[63:21.45]How did I just die?
[63:24.22]Somebody has to pick me up.
[63:28.57]I don't know how to do that.
[63:31.39]Yeah, yeah.
[63:32.57]Oh, I got it.
[63:34.88]It said help in use.
[63:38.92]Can we put sticks on there or does it have to be logs?
[63:43.01]Chat, what do you think?
[63:44.15]What is it?
[63:44.59]Oh, it's sticks.
[63:45.25]It's sticks.
[63:45.67]I'm adding sticks.
[63:48.35]Sticks work.
[63:51.72]Sticks will work.
[63:52.52]Okay, cool.
[63:56.74]This stuff is still raw.
[63:58.91]going on here yeah we need yeah there you go Ster Ster that's that's good uh build storage for the sticks apparently people are yelling at us saying storage for the sticks storage yeah if I wanted to be yelled at I would not like be playing video games this is my escape you guys um me too but if you're not getting serious then you're not gaming
[64:26.18]Water collector.
[64:28.38]Oh, we need this.
[64:31.55]Okay.
[64:33.43]I'm going to put a water collector here.
[64:36.88]You have banana leaves?
[64:39.66]I think they're... How do we get long sticks?
[64:44.09]Long sticks just end up... We just have to cut a tree down?
[64:48.72]Okay, we need long sticks first, apparently.
[64:51.46]So cut down a tree to get long sticks.
[64:53.60]How did you make the stone axe?
[64:57.65]You need knife from two stone.
[65:02.73]Once you have knife, stone, a stick.
[65:06.52]Yes, stone plus stick.
[65:08.42]When you have knife, then you make Oonga.
[65:11.60]Oonga Boonga.
[65:15.31]Palm leaves.
[65:16.65]Good.
[65:17.13]I'm going to need long sticks.
[65:19.40]There's a good long stick right there.
[65:22.51]How do you dry them?
[65:29.22]This is my water collector, by the way.
[65:31.18]If somebody... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[65:32.82]When you have... Never mind.
[65:37.83]Just fucking kill me.
[65:40.68]Could've been playing, like, Minecraft.
[65:44.48]You just put the... You put the pickaxe and you make it look like a pickaxe and it just turns into one.
[65:49.79]Yeah, it's kinda nice.
[65:51.58]And realistic, too.
[65:53.26]It's very realistic.
[65:54.37]We need more long sticks.
[65:57.45]I had a... I made a nether portal in real life once.
[66:01.38]What the fuck was that?
[66:02.50]What is that?
[66:02.96]What is that?
[66:03.38]What?
[66:04.06]Oh my god, there's a fucking tiger!
[66:05.32]This is a tiger.
[66:07.46]There's a tiger?
[66:08.79]Holy shit, he ran away.
[66:11.03]I'll scare him away.
[66:13.41]I think he smells the human meat.
[66:15.38]He smells the human meat.
[66:17.90]How do I... How do I not bleed to death?
[66:23.26]Surely I wrote something down about this.
[66:25.60]I just ate the body.
[66:27.72]I just ate a person.
[66:28.54]I need to go fucking sit down for a minute.
[66:33.59]It's okay, buddy.
[66:34.31]Listen, we didn't have a choice.
[66:36.35]We didn't have a choice.
[66:39.80]It's us or them.
[66:41.28]Okay, that other meat is cooked.
[66:43.00]Whoever needs to eat.
[66:44.83]Why is this meat not cooking?
[66:46.51]It needs to be, I think, on the left and right side.
[66:48.31]I think it can only cook on the left side.
[66:52.66]Oh!
[66:52.76]Molinaria leaf.
[66:53.20]Do we have a molinaria leaf?
[66:55.26]That makes so much sense now.
[66:56.94]Because otherwise I'm dead because I got bit by a fucking tiger.
[67:00.03]Hey, we- we- uh, water.
[67:01.23]We need water collector.
[67:01.99]We need long sticks right now to get that, um... We need to be able to drink the water in there.
[67:08.29]We need more long sticks.
[67:09.42]I have a more urgent issue here, man.
[67:12.68]Dehydration is important, dude.
[67:16.45]There's just someone left the human meat out up here.
[67:20.31]We'll cook it, man.
[67:22.62]Yeah, dog.
[67:23.48]I'm dying from blood loss.
[67:27.31]Little blood rot.
[67:28.23]And you're like, we'll drink some water.
[67:29.85]Have you had any water lately, dear?
[67:32.16]No, I'm bleeding.
[67:34.06]You need to make a bandage.
[67:37.95]It's in your notebook somewhere.
[67:39.97]Where is it?
[67:40.51]Yeah, it's Molinera leaf.
[67:41.87]I don't... Yeah, I don't even know what that is.
[67:44.04]Molinera leaf is... It looks like the... I'll find one.
[67:49.54]At this point, it's just easier to die.
[67:52.77]We need one more long stick.
[67:54.53]I got one.
[67:55.63]Don't give up, Star.
[67:56.39]We'll find that leaf for you.
[67:58.34]It's got yellow flowers around it.
[68:00.02]It's like it's sprouting out of the ground.
[68:01.48]It has a bunch... Here it is right here.
[68:03.40]Here's a long stick.
[68:05.33]Come to me, Star.
[68:08.49]Molinera... There it is.
[68:09.96]Alright, I need banana leaves now.
[68:11.32]I'll finish everything else.
[68:12.86]I got dry leaf.
[68:13.78]Ster, I'm trying to save your life.
[68:15.55]Yes, I'm coming!
[68:18.33]Can you harvest it?
[68:19.07]Can you turn it into the bandage for me?
[68:21.37]Uh... I don't have... My rock is gone.
[68:25.90]You need a rock.
[68:26.48]I don't have a rock.
[68:27.36]We need to harvest it.
[68:28.26]It's... See it right here?
[68:29.78]It's right there.
[68:32.59]How do we get banana leaf?
[68:34.27]Well, I'm dead.
[68:36.55]I don't know.
[68:38.06]Anybody got any stones?
[68:40.54]I have some stones, yeah.
[68:42.14]I actually have plenty.
[68:43.84]I'm going to add another long stick to the water collector.
[68:46.58]Yes, we need that water.
[68:52.35]Oh, it's just banana leaves now.
[68:53.59]Banana leaves.
[68:55.87]Any more stones?
[68:56.47]Can I have a couple stones?
[69:00.67]Thank you.
[69:01.47]Thank you.
[69:03.30]Yep, yep, yep.
[69:03.98]And then how do you make a stone axe?
[69:06.90]Okay, so start with stone knife.
[69:08.66]Two stone.
[69:10.40]And then from when you have the knife, use a stick plus a stone and you'll get an axe.
[69:16.73]Okay.
[69:17.89]Yeah.
[69:24.14]Ster.
[69:24.74]Died.
[69:27.43]I think he wanted to.
[69:30.03]Hey, my lacerations are gone as I was reincarnated.
[69:34.38]Oh, wait, hold on.
[69:35.08]I found banana leaf.
[69:36.28]I have a good job.
[69:36.78]Banana leaf.
[69:39.24]Where?
[69:41.81]oh come here come here oh come here they're over it I don't like it I need to rest alright a couple things one you see these fruits we should pick these we have banana two banana leaves this is a banana leaf you see these so we need a knife once you use the knife on these an axe yeah an axe I think I use the knife that seemed to work but yeah if you use that you can lift several at a time yeah we gotta get this collection up bingo nice hell yeah
[70:15.09]Where did I die?
[70:15.93]It's done.
[70:16.61]Alright, now we got a water collector.
[70:18.25]Perfect.
[70:19.76]But how do we get the water under it?
[70:21.54]It's just dripping into nothing.
[70:23.38]Um, we gotta make a bucket maybe?
[70:26.43]Wait.
[70:29.44]For the record, Jerm, there's already another collector over here.
[70:32.84]Is there?
[70:34.11]Yeah.
[70:34.63]Oh.
[70:35.77]Wait, was it really?

[70:40.15]It was working too.
[70:41.75]No.
[70:41.83]It's working.
[70:42.41]We just need coconut bowl.
[70:44.40]Yeah.
[70:44.52]I saw there was a coconut somewhere.
[70:45.94]Do I have it?
[70:46.54]Wait, I broke one.
[70:47.90]A bunch of coconuts.
[70:49.08]Oh, yeah.
[70:49.44]Because we can make apparently a coconut bowl.
[70:51.16]The water is going into the bottom and just hitting the ground, guys.
[70:55.53]Yeah, that's what we're trying to do, Ster.
[70:56.91]Okay, I died earlier with a pot.
[70:59.23]I got bowls.
[70:59.69]I got bowls.
[71:00.11]Wait, you had a pot?
[71:01.35]Ster here.
[71:02.27]Yeah.
[71:02.57]That's way better than a coconut.
[71:04.25]Take this.
[71:11.10]Ooh.
[71:11.20]It's in use.
[71:12.87]Wait, I just ate the bowl.
[71:20.94]Oh, that's funny.
[71:24.16]Is it working?
[71:28.71]I can't find my body.
[71:33.69]Do we have to make it into a bowl?
[71:35.87]I don't know.
[71:37.45]Maybe there's another pot in here somewhere.
[71:41.68]Dude, this is green hell.
[71:46.20]Yeah, they named it correctly.
[71:48.22]Is this mulch?
[71:49.51]I don't know.
[71:50.57]It's a weed whacker though, Chunt.
[71:53.79]Anybody know how to work this?
[71:59.98]Why is finding a rock a hard thing to do?
[72:03.61]Yeah, it is actually surprisingly hard to find a rock.
[72:06.81]Oh, harvest it.
[72:07.73]I just found one.
[72:11.24]Eat the coconut first.
[72:12.72]Why did you fucking tell me to do that, guys?
[72:17.08]Yeah, they got me too.
[72:19.36]What the hell?
[72:20.22]Now we don't have any more coconuts.
[72:22.25]I got coconut.
[72:23.13]I just found one.
[72:24.07]Okay.
[72:25.17]Right-click it and say harvest.
[72:27.69]Right-click and harvest.
[72:28.45]I'm going to bring it to you guys and we'll do it together.
[72:31.64]Oh, shit.
[72:32.56]I got a bowl.
[72:36.60]Oh, coconut bowl!
[72:38.72]So how do we get it under there?
[72:40.18]Boom, it's in there!
[72:40.78]Drag it onto the circle.
[72:42.85]Up with the bowl.
[72:43.57]Oh, nice.
[72:45.61]Alright, cool.
[72:46.05]So I want to do that for this one too, because we have another collector over here.
[72:53.28]Water, finally.
[72:58.39]Oh, there's a map.
[73:01.93]How do you do this again?
[73:04.20]That was so loud, but it was delicious.
[73:10.21]split it open you have to eat it you have to you you split the coconut eat it and then it'll be in your inventory on a different slot as I died can we go to our bedrooms probably not a bad idea I need to want to pass uh wake me up I can't I can't eat it you can't right click and say eat oh it was still okay I got it yeah
[73:40.89]Where is Ster?
[73:45.70]I'm in the middle of the woods.
[73:47.97]What are you doing out there?
[73:48.73]Trying to figure out how to combine sticks.
[73:52.57]How do you actually combine the stick and the stone?
[73:58.42]It's just stick and stone.
[74:03.95]The stick thing is pissing me off.
[74:06.21]Yeah, so if there's a stick and a stone, what do I do after I put them there?
[74:10.55]You click craft.
[74:12.35]There's no button to say click craft.
[74:14.98]It says place an additional item on the table.
[74:17.72]There you do the rope.
[74:20.56]You don't need a rope.
[74:21.28]You should just be able to do it.
[74:22.58]It's just a regular stone.
[74:24.27]Do you have a bone knife?
[74:26.37]No.
[74:27.17]You need... Ster, I've been trying to tell you.
[74:30.83]You need a bone knife.
[74:33.08]What?
[74:34.39]Then why does Trevor just keep saying stick and stone?
[74:37.85]That's all you need.
[74:38.80]You just need this.
[74:39.36]Come here.
[74:39.76]I have another axe.
[74:40.52]I just made an axe right here, buddy.
[74:42.46]This is how people die.
[74:44.17]We need to be better to each other in the wilderness.
[74:51.00]Right here, Ster.
[74:51.56]I have an axe for you.
[74:53.62]You know what?
[74:54.08]No.
[74:54.77]You need to learn how to do this yourself.
[74:56.98]Oh!
[74:57.76]Alright, here it is.
[74:58.22]Okay, well then how do I get a bone knife?
[75:00.67]I was looking and my body had it.
[75:02.29]Two stone.
[75:02.57]Not bone knife, stone knife.
[75:03.89]Yeah, take this though, on the ground.
[75:07.00]In use.
[75:11.48]He just keeps saying, in use.
[75:13.96]They are ten feet from the resort?
[75:15.61]What does that mean?
[75:16.67]What do you mean, the resort?
[75:18.15]What are you talking about, resort?
[75:20.41]Which way?
[75:20.77]Which direction?
[75:21.39]What direction is the fucking resort?
[75:25.56]That's our last resort.
[75:27.80]Guys, how about we sleep?
[75:29.24]Guys, let's go to the bedrooms.
[75:35.06]Okay, that would be the funniest thing a game could ever do, is tell you you need to survive, make the game super hard and crazy and brutal, but there's actually like a five-star hotel getaway resort a hundred feet away from where you are.
[75:50.52]There's a guy that said there's literally a resort.
[75:57.61]Here we go.
[75:58.26]Alright, we're sleeping now.
[76:00.96]I want to look for the resort at some point.
[76:05.44]I just died in my sleep again.
[76:07.68]We can't sleep through the night.
[76:10.91]I got an infection.
[76:12.61]Ow, my stomach.
[76:13.45]That hurt.
[76:15.21]We can't get a full night's sleep to cycle the day because somebody always dies in the middle of the night.
[76:21.64]My bed is full of my loot.
[76:25.50]Alright.
[76:25.76]I'm going to sleep again.
[76:27.33]I'm going to sleep again.
[76:27.91]I slept again.
[76:29.96]I'm going to die because I'm so hungry.
[76:32.18]What happened to the thing we were building?
[76:35.54]Vinny, there's meat over there.
[76:37.43]There's meat that should be cooked.
[76:38.81]Nah, it's fine.
[76:39.61]I'm just going to die.
[76:40.35]You're going to die in your sleep.
[76:41.97]Yeah, I don't care.
[76:42.89]I'm going to die again.
[76:43.79]I got smallpox or something.
[76:46.74]Hey, drink the clean water over here.
[76:49.76]Wait, do we?
[76:52.93]Where did we get that from?
[76:54.13]This thing is burnt.
[76:55.09]Who didn't eat this?
[76:58.96]I'm not eating the burnt food.
[77:00.10]Who's eating the burnt food?
[77:02.34]I'll eat it.
[77:04.90]I like well done.
[77:07.49]No, we don't have... We've got big pox.
[77:10.39]Fuck that.
[77:11.35]Wait.
[77:12.31]When your friend dies near you, you lose sanity.
[77:15.58]What?
[77:18.14]I'm drinking all the water for myself.
[77:20.10]Did we ever get any of those healing yellow plants?
[77:22.84]I'll go get it right now.
[77:23.94]Don't worry.
[77:24.49]I'll take care of you.
[77:29.85]I'll go get you some heals and I'll bandage you up.
[77:32.28]You can show me everything that you need and where all the problems are.
[77:35.06]Okay, so it is actually disadvantage to die next to your friends.
[77:43.93]I understand now.
[77:46.67]What's that plant?
[77:50.59]Oh my god, I thought you were a fucking monster.
[77:55.20]I am.
[77:55.90]You have leeches on you.
[77:56.74]Hold on, you have leeches on you.
[77:57.82]Get them off!
[78:00.21]So do you!
[78:03.40]Vinny.
[78:04.16]You're covered in leeches.
[78:05.98]Where's the fucking resort?
[78:08.54]I can't do this.
[78:09.28]I can't do this trip anymore.
[78:11.89]Chat member, where's the resort?
[78:15.71]There's- are you- Are you serious, chat member?
[78:19.30]Was there really a resort?
[78:20.00]Oh, there's leeches!
[78:20.74]Make sure you check your body for leeches!
[78:25.27]I have to rip them off manually.
[78:27.30]We need a torch, man.
[78:28.20]I'm making a torch.
[78:28.90]Use a bone needle to pop the worms and shit, too.
[78:36.15]Yeah, give me a torch, man.
[78:37.25]That's, like, priority number one.
[78:39.53]How do you make a torch?
[78:41.65]I don't think I can do this without air conditioner.
[78:45.00]Fire is out.
[78:45.98]There you go, Poke.
[78:47.28]Campfire ashes.
[78:48.50]We need into the fire.
[78:49.48]Oh, my God.
[78:53.51]I don't have any kindling, and I don't have the hand drill.
[78:55.99]I can...
[78:57.13]I'll take care of the fire, you guys go find medicine.
[79:02.50]Alright, um... Got it.
[79:08.32]Green Hell Resort.
[79:10.85]Let's type that into the... Green Hills Resort.
[79:13.09]Oh, what are you talking about?
[79:18.80]We can make a grill rack.
[79:21.98]Everyone press F as fast as you can.
[79:29.58]time to wake up so is there a resort or was he lying no I think that was a lie where's campfire that's a crossband for me though I do have a map I picked up a map along the way and it's huh where is campfire point pointing to something
[79:59.94]26 and 40.
[80:05.77]This guy is always thirsty.
[80:08.53]Because he's probably sick.
[80:09.99]Is there a watch?
[80:10.45]Tell us where we are.
[80:11.05]50 west, 29 south.
[80:15.33]Dude, where is the campfire?
[80:19.80]Well, poke, so it says... Wait, what button was that?
[80:25.45]Let's see.
[80:27.55]Oh, so we're in that square.
[80:28.81]We're in the 50 square.
[80:30.97]Yeah, we're in 50.
[80:33.19]Wait, is there a 50?
[80:35.02]Yeah, we're 50.
[80:35.90]20-something, right?
[80:41.74]Where's the campfire?
[80:44.93]Wasn't it right there?
[80:46.63]It's like an endless confusion and horror.
[80:50.61]I swear to God, it was in my notebook.
[80:55.18]Hmm.
[80:55.34]um I'm going to go back to the base and then I think I'm going to go north I'm going to attempt to make that journey but my torch just went out you went past guys we Jerma and sir we have a um we have a map that's pointing to a location campfire is gone yeah I got a feeling I don't know
[81:25.28]What happened to the frame we were building?
[81:29.22]I am going to lose my mind.
[81:31.18]Where is the campfire in the fucking notebook?
[81:35.89]Oh, in the notebook.
[81:37.19]I was having the same thing earlier.
[81:39.48]I was here an hour ago.
[81:42.30]And no one could relate to me at all.
[81:47.89]Go away.
[81:49.77]I just told somebody to leave.
[81:50.91]Wait, where?
[81:56.60]I have no fucking idea.
[81:58.68]I don't see the campfire at all.
[82:00.94]You're right, Jerma.
[82:02.26]Oh, small fire.
[82:03.10]It's in the third tab on the right.
[82:05.11]And then scroll to the left.
[82:06.91]Use the mouse wheel.
[82:08.27]That's so weird.
[82:09.23]Whoa, what?
[82:13.32]Okay.
[82:15.66]That is so weird.
[82:17.00]That was weird.
[82:18.68]Well, let's just fucking double it up.
[82:20.61]We need the extra fire anyways.
[82:22.67]Do we?
[82:23.17]Yeah.
[82:24.91]But why in this small room?
[82:26.55]I feel like we're going to die.
[82:29.52]Shut up.
[82:29.70]Because it's the only roof we have.
[82:32.84]Because I keep asking what happened to the log thing and everyone ignores the star.
[82:38.77]Why do we have two fires?
[82:40.11]We're doubling?
[82:41.31]We're making a massive fire here.
[82:44.55]Alright.
[82:44.73]Do you have any kindling?
[82:46.56]I can make... Oh my god.
[82:48.78]Survive one night in the jungle.
[82:50.16]We just did it.
[82:52.46]Wow.
[82:54.19]It's on, like, night six.
[82:56.91]Yeah, I was gonna say.
[82:57.57]Oh, what the fuck?
[83:03.08]I understand the stick problem now.
[83:05.04]I understand the stick thing now easily.
[83:06.77]Oh my god.
[83:08.03]What was the problem, Polk?
[83:09.51]Just the harvest.
[83:10.89]You just harvest a log.
[83:11.63]Oh, right-click harvest.
[83:13.49]Yeah, if you harvest a log, you just get everything.
[83:21.17]It took six days to survive one day.
[83:25.54]Geniuses.
[83:26.74]Wait, were you guys creating this?
[83:27.78]Oh, I disassembled this.
[83:33.67]Yeah, that was me.
[83:36.19]What do you use the stone axe on?
[83:37.59]Like, how do you get a log?
[83:40.65]Just go around the tree and hit it.
[83:43.70]You gotta, like, actually break the parts of the tree.
[83:47.32]You gotta double the fire, which means double the meat.
[83:52.92]Coconut.
[83:53.30]I just died.
[83:58.68]Alright, what do you guys think?
[83:59.38]Is there an easier way to get long sticks?
[84:01.29]Long sticks is annoying.
[84:03.11]Long sticks, yeah, you need those skinny trees with an axe.
[84:05.95]Gonna knock them down.
[84:08.61]Thirsty.
[84:11.34]Jerma, I have a short-term goal.
[84:14.86]Have you opened the map yet?
[84:18.63]I just puked.
[84:20.81]What?
[84:21.17]The map?
[84:23.04]Yeah, open the map.
[84:23.92]I found a map earlier.
[84:26.40]So if you go to C. Uh-huh.
[84:28.63]Map.
[84:29.15]Do you see that little arrow and the two?
[84:34.72]I do.
[84:35.34]Yeah, I do down here.
[84:37.38]So we're apparently at 2950.
[84:39.20]Okay.
[84:41.55]So we're at bottom left.
[84:44.09]And I'm thinking there's something really good.
[84:46.15]I can't see anything at that spot.
[84:48.32]It's the status on that campfire and...
[84:50.17]They're both roaring, thanks to me.
[84:53.16]They don't, like, make much light.
[84:55.66]Yeah, I think we should go check it out.
[84:58.40]Maybe once we get established a bit.
[85:01.55]Who has ropes?
[85:03.51]We need to rope up the frame.
[85:06.15]I am getting rope right now.
[85:09.16]Call me Spider-Man when I get back, but I'll have plenty.
[85:11.48]Apparently I had them, never mind.
[85:14.20]How do you make a torch?
[85:17.32]One rope and one stick, Jerma.
[85:19.33]This is like our first ever world premiere.
[85:25.09]How do you make walls in this bit?
[85:30.84]That's a good question.
[85:34.65]Alright.
[85:34.87]The best part about this is we found somebody else's house.
[85:38.59]I think they were making drugs, dude.
[85:43.62]Oh, I see it.
[85:44.78]Like, seriously, this place was, like... It was, like, cocaine, I think, over here.
[85:54.49]Alright.
[85:55.62]I'm going on an expedition.
[85:57.22]Ster, we built this... What the fuck?
[86:00.00]Ster.
[86:01.10]We can't even... We can't even build walls on this thing, because we're... It's, like, in... The terrain of the other stuff.
[86:08.21]Really?
[86:09.49]Yeah.
[86:12.58]I think we should...
[86:14.40]we need a roof we we have to turn this down there's a there's a shaman guy here I don't know if you all can see him or not no he's gonna kill me he's gonna kill me I don't know what you're talking about I ate human meat you okay dude no I'm not bro I told you not to eat the centipede although it looks a little tasty

[87:43.55]Yeah, I'm going, uh... I'm just going to go home.
[87:47.17]No, Ster, Ster.
[87:52.04]Come on.
[87:52.82]We've been planning this camping trip for so long, dude.
[88:01.05]You don't want to leave now when...
[88:05.18]You know, we're bonding, buddy.
[88:06.62]Like Kirk, Spock, and McCoy when they were near the foot of the mountain.
[88:16.83]This torch doesn't light anything.
[88:25.62]One more big stick.
[88:32.71]Huh.
[88:44.33]Eat more green pine cones.
[88:50.16]I can always tell when Ster's enjoying a game we play.
[88:55.94]Ster hates everything though.
[88:59.35]What was the game that we played?
[89:00.55]The Drug Dealer Simulator?
[89:01.71]I think I had my turn at that too at one point.
[89:07.14]My turn was Monster Hunter.
[89:10.88]Yeah, it didn't click.
[89:12.75]I mean, it was just a co-op setting.
[89:14.93]I played a lot of it, though, after.
[89:16.63]Oh, yeah.
[89:17.41]You probably played more than I did.
[89:20.48]Well, I mean, do you want to keep... I feel like... Are you guys good?
[89:24.35]Do you guys want to keep going with this?
[89:26.19]I'm learning.
[89:27.51]I'm enjoying it.
[89:28.05]I'm making a house now.
[89:29.07]Yeah, I think we're just starting to learn.
[89:35.02]We're getting... Now we're figuring shit out.
[89:36.84]We got this.
[89:37.49]He's having too much fun.
[89:40.27]Ster, I made it.
[89:40.73]Over here.
[89:42.95]What's this noise?
[89:48.46]Oh man, damn logs.
[89:49.82]Oh, I got a long stick.
[89:50.78]Okay, okay, that's good.
[89:54.87]We need several long sticks, right?
[89:59.15]The house is over here, guys.
[90:00.65]Wait, you guys made another frame?
[90:02.51]No, that's not, okay.
[90:08.94]Okay.
[90:09.10]I need to sleep.
[90:11.39]I need to sleep too, yeah.
[90:13.63]Do we want to, you know, do all at the same time or?
[90:17.45]No, doing it at the same time just makes time go faster and we want daylight.

[94:29.46]One of these things.
[94:35.51]What can we do with the charcoal?
[94:39.19]I would imagine that's like fire related for better cooking.
[94:42.36]I don't know any stones laying around.

[96:25.03]We should definitely get some gear and a ton of food and then just go somewhere.
[96:32.24]Yeah, that spot on the map seems promising because it's highlighted, so it must be good.

[101:50.80]I'm poisoned.
[101:53.11]God, this is my alcoholic character, I swear to God, man.
[101:56.87]We need to make you an anti- I'm on top of him.
[101:58.67]I'm on top of him.
[102:01.93]What is happening down there?
[102:07.56]I've never heard him laugh like that.
[102:18.01]Did he eat me?
[102:19.35]What happened?
[102:21.49]It just looked so funny.
[102:27.96]Did you see him?
[102:30.43]You got on top of him and your body just like... Like an angry baby, just like... Like, I can't explain.
[102:41.94]Dude, I didn't have anything that good, but I feel like we could get some alligator meat or something.
[102:47.23]I don't know.
[102:50.27]Hey, Poke, I'm here.
[102:51.64]Where's Jerma's alligator that he fought?
[102:53.48]Over here?
[102:54.72]I don't know, I was too busy laughing.
[102:56.92]The alligator disappeared.
[102:58.38]I see one.
[103:00.37]I see one.
[103:01.49]Where?
[103:02.93]Over here.
[103:03.73]They're hard.
[103:04.69]It was almost a one-hit KO, by the way.
[103:12.38]I gotta get some more stuff.
[103:15.79]What happened to my axe?
[103:17.21]Good luck fighting that thing.
[103:18.25]I wish you two luck.
[103:19.47]I think with two, one might be able to distract.
[103:25.40]Okay, I'm going to try.
[103:26.12]I have one arrow.
[103:27.22]I could shoot it.
[103:29.32]Arrows are hard to make because you need a lot of feathers.
[103:35.35]It's like two feathers and a stick per arrow.
[103:38.99]Should I do it?
[103:39.91]What do you think?
[103:46.50]Oh God, the aiming.
[103:47.40]Oh Jesus.
[103:47.60]I don't see the bird you see.
[103:50.33]Are the birds localized?
[103:52.67]Was there a bird over there in the tree?
[103:54.57]Yeah, there's like a couple birds.
[103:56.79]Oh shit, here's the alligator.
[103:59.71]I need to rock.
[104:03.04]I don't think this is it.
[104:05.18]Shot it.
[104:05.58]That hurt me.
[104:06.36]Oh, it is.
[104:07.52]That hurt me.
[104:08.46]It was so fun.
[104:08.90]What hurt you?
[104:10.28]Just the way Jerma died.
[104:11.59]Oh.
[104:12.69]Did you try and jump on its head?
[104:15.02]I was just watching you and... Oh, I picked up an arrow.
[104:21.15]Here, I dropped your arrow.
[104:21.75]I dropped your arrow.
[104:23.99]It's the same animation!
[104:26.97]You need to come back and see me die.
[104:31.88]I wanna see it.
[104:32.62]I wanna use this.
[104:33.44]I wanna see it.
[104:34.10]I'm coming back.
[104:37.61]It's so stupid.
[104:39.25]53 west, right?
[104:40.27]25?
[104:41.78]I'm coming I'm running there too northwest yeah you were right Jerma that that came in did they it does not around that is like a two hit kill yeah it does not oh hold on okay I gotta get back to base I'm just gonna explode in a sec
[105:07.55]Ster is having a ton of fun, by the way.
[105:11.04]I can tell.
[105:11.54]You guys are over there in the fun zone.
[105:14.30]We're all laughing.
[105:16.55]Oh, I finally made a bandage, and how do you use it?
[105:20.43]You have to be inspecting yourself.
[105:22.20]It's in the inspection menu.
[105:23.16]You drag it onto your arm or leg while you're inspecting.
[105:26.66]But if I'm inspecting, then I don't have my inventory open.
[105:28.95]Hit tab while you're inspecting.
[105:31.67]I died before you guys got there.
[105:33.29]Oh, shit.
[105:37.39]We're gonna get this alligator.
[105:44.40]Why am I just dying?
[105:50.95]Sir, I have a game recommendation, and it's not a comedy recommendation.
[105:54.31]I think it's a game you'd really like, okay?
[105:56.00]The name is funny, though.
[105:59.32]It's called He Is Coming.
[106:02.04]I'm not kidding.
[106:02.72]It's real.
[106:03.24]It just came out.
[106:04.58]It might not be out yet.
[106:05.61]It's an indie game.
[106:06.29]It's really good.
[106:07.81]It's your kind of game.
[106:09.39]Okay.
[106:11.95]Who is he?
[106:12.91]A boss.
[106:14.86]I feel like I saw this somewhere.
[106:17.36]Yeah, it's good.
[106:18.76]I just played it the other day.
[106:19.92]I got the full version.
[106:20.72]I was like, whoa, this is awesome.
[106:22.51]Why are you recommending this to me while I'm freaking out about Green Hell?
[106:27.47]I just feel like, you know, if you want to have fun.
[106:30.82]Alright, Vinny.
[106:31.56]In the
[106:32.08]Yeah.
[106:32.80]We gotta kill this alligator.
[106:35.04]Yeah.
[106:35.40]Because he's gonna drop, like, purples.
[106:38.19]Yeah, he's... Yes, he is.
[106:40.41]Alright.
[106:41.41]Wait, are you guys on the... Wait, hold on.
[106:42.51]Wait for me.
[106:43.74]I'll let him kill me.
[106:45.30]Alright, I want to see this.
[106:47.08]Don't kill him.
[106:49.49]Yeah, I googled the name of that game, and I've got some really weird stuff on my computer now.
[106:53.71]Is he dead?
[106:54.93]He's dead.
[106:55.25]Wait, how did he die?
[106:56.52]I don't know.
[106:58.88]In use.
[106:59.74]Why is he dead?
[107:01.80]What do we do with it?
[107:03.12]I don't know.
[107:03.48]I'm harvesting them.
[107:04.72]I think it was just old age, guys.
[107:08.16]I mean, we got a bunch of meat.
[107:10.09]We'll find another one, but whose stuff is this over here?
[107:13.09]Mine, mine.
[107:14.29]Yeah, it's probably a combination.
[107:18.62]Okay, I have a maggot on my bandaged leg.
[107:21.30]Now what do I do?
[107:23.34]Can this be in VR and I can just reach down and pull my skin off?
[107:27.00]It is.
[107:27.63]It is in VR.
[107:32.41]Yeah, there is a VR version of this, yeah.
[107:34.37]Sir, we're all going to get bandaged up.
[107:36.33]We're all going to get... We're going to get the squad ready.
[107:40.96]And we're going to run.
[107:41.54]Does anybody have some Neurosporin?
[107:44.96]Neurosporin?
[107:45.85]Do they have that in Rome?
[107:47.89]I don't know.
[107:48.43]I don't know.
[107:49.55]Neuro.
[107:50.61]Neurosporin.
[107:57.50]All I care about is this alligator death animation.

[108:00.79]I want to see it.
[108:01.59]I need to see that.
[108:03.03]You're the only one who's seen it so far.
[108:04.65]I'm overhyping it.
[108:06.60]I hope it's funny.
[108:08.92]It will be.
[108:09.40]I swear it's funny.

[111:35.45]Do you want to try to go to that... We should try to go to the... Like you said, Vinny, that X kind of marks the spot, the red one.
[111:41.96]Yeah, you guys want to meet up?

[112:17.81]Oh, it's getting dark.
[112:18.53]This is fresh water.
[112:20.00]Okay.
[112:20.88]Okay.
[112:21.26]Where did you say you guys are?
[112:23.12]I'm traveling.
[112:24.72]Don't believe them.
[112:25.22]It's not fresh.
[112:25.74]I have parasites.
[112:27.66]I was going to say, it says dirty in parentheses.
[112:33.19]You guys are north.
[112:37.09]Yeah, just go straight north.
[112:40.11]Yeah, I ate a poison dart frog just now.
[112:42.00]I was trying to just pick it up.
[112:43.06]I didn't want to eat it.
[112:43.96]My character was just like, oh, tiger.
[112:47.58]Oh god.
[112:49.81]No secret behind the waterfall?
[112:51.49]Oh, what?
[112:53.09]There always is.
[112:53.61]Every game needs a secret behind the waterfall.
[113:01.65]Can't get up it, can you?
[113:03.85]I think it's stamina.
[113:04.81]Oh, Vinny.
[113:06.23]That was a leopard?
[113:15.59]That was really disorienting.
[113:18.40]I just died, and you're more worried about the semantics of whether or not that's a leopard.
[113:24.39]Can't get up here.
[113:25.29]I'm too weak.
[113:25.97]All you care about?
[113:31.72]What is the coordinates for you guys?
[113:34.68]I'm stuck.
[113:37.36]52, 15.
[113:39.79]I just have stripes.

[114:47.76]Yeah, what's this?
[114:52.29]New map location?

[115:13.49]Can I make a fire?
[115:15.29]Hold on a second.
[115:16.37]I think I can make us a fire.
[115:20.56]No, no.
[115:21.02]There's a fire... Oh, yeah, yeah.
[115:23.44]I need to... Ember.
[115:24.60]I need to break it down.
[115:26.11]I need small sticks.
[115:30.81]Okay.
[115:31.34]There we go.
[115:33.14]My sense of direction is so bad, I'm like... I'll just walk in a straight line, and then somehow I'm going... A completely opposite direction.
[115:41.91]I just threw up.
[115:42.63]You good?
[115:43.11]All over those coconuts.
[115:44.25]If you want to still eat it.
[115:45.17]Spoiled banana.
[115:46.25]Okay, we need, um... A bird's nest.
[115:49.84]Oh my... 29.
[115:51.76]I'm at 48, 19.
[115:52.36]You guys... Where are you guys still?
[115:58.73]We are... 47, 29 apparently.
[116:02.67]52, 17.
[116:03.39]I'm going to the red mark.
[116:04.52]I'm going to the red mark on the map.
[116:06.28]I'm just going to beeline it directly.
[116:09.26]You're just going to run for the mark?
[116:10.90]I'm running for the mark.
[116:11.91]Yeah, I'm doing it.
[116:13.31]I'm not that far.
[116:14.83]If I get killed by a leopard, it's probably for the best.
[116:19.56]But I'm on my way.
[116:20.54]Alright, folk.
[116:20.92]We need to find a bird's nest or a fiber or something.
[116:25.60]Because we need to make this food.
[116:26.59]We need to eat something or we're going to die.
[116:32.14]Star, where are you?
[116:34.22]What is your coordinates?
[116:36.58]Uh, 49, 18.
[116:37.67]Do we all sleep to make a daytime?
[116:40.01]Oh, you're, you're real north.
[116:41.21]52, 17 is where me and Poke are.
[116:45.76]I need to rest.
[116:46.92]Yeah, I kinda do need to sleep.
[116:47.94]I'm gonna pass out in a second.
[116:51.67]I got frogged.
[116:54.03]Frogged?
[116:55.30]I saw a frog and I got excited and I grabbed it and it was poisonous.
[116:58.36]Yeah, I did the same.
[116:59.66]Poison dart frog.
[117:01.26]I just looked like a little fella.
[117:02.87]He was like... God, I could use a drink.
[117:13.42]Oh, no.
[117:15.10]What did you guys discover?
[117:17.22]Oh, can you pick me up?
[117:22.05]Oh, I might pass out right in front of you.
[117:25.09]Oh, we both... Oh, no, that's bad.
[117:29.65]had a lot of why we had like beef jerky we had I could have picked you up a millisecond sooner and then passed out and then you would have got me and then would have been saved oh that's not good our expedition oh oh it's a good thing I'm here hey Ster come on down to 52 17. I'm 51 19 this like little hut on the water you can poke what way 53
[117:58.96]I'm dead right now.
[118:01.64]You guys are dead.
[118:03.06]Does it even matter anymore?
[118:04.20]He could pick us up.
[118:08.63]He gets here fast enough.
[118:11.55]I'm directly east of that spot, chat.
[118:14.80]I'm going to do it.
[118:15.36]I'm going to do it.
[118:15.86]Yeah, I'm going to say something crazy.
[118:18.22]Okay.
[118:18.82]Oh, no.
[118:19.54]Michael Punk.
[118:20.28]How's that?
[118:22.01]Oh.
[118:23.37]Michael Punk.
[118:25.05]I'm doing it for Ster.
[118:26.15]Ster is having a terrible time.
[118:28.79]I'm doing it for you.
[118:32.20]One final thing.
[118:34.98]Everybody get to the base.
[118:36.30]We're going to run together to the red X. Yes, that's what I like.
[118:41.41]Oh, fuck.
[118:41.99]There's an alligator.
[118:43.55]There's a red X?
[118:45.06]Oh, wait.
[118:45.26]No, that's just a rock.
[118:47.64]Yeah, check the map.
[118:48.34]Press M, sir.
[118:49.70]Yeah, I don't see a red X. The red tent with the letter, the number.
[118:55.93]Nope.
[118:57.28]I see an A2.
[118:58.94]Yeah, that's what we're talking about.
[119:00.36]That's not an A, though.
[119:01.18]If you zoom in, there's no line across.
[119:03.68]It's not an A. Oh, we're alive.
[119:06.31]Yeah, I woke up.
[119:07.23]Okay.
[119:09.05]Well, I'm in the exact opposite direction of that.
[119:13.75]Okay, I'm going there now.
[119:15.01]I'm almost there.
[119:16.50]I think it's better if we just die.
[119:20.44]I'm just... Listen.
[119:22.96]Southeast.
[119:24.44]I'm just walking until we get there.
[119:27.28]I'm about to pass out.
[119:30.49]Wait, actually?
[119:30.95]Yeah.
[119:33.43]Just leave me.
[119:34.11]Just leave me.
[119:35.62]I can wake you up.
[119:39.82]This bar will fill in all.
[119:41.36]Oh, there we go.
[119:42.73]2641.
[119:43.83]Where am I?
[119:45.17]I'm at 2542.
[119:47.61]I'm real close to this thing.
[119:53.56]God, I can use a drink.
[119:59.65]I'm really sad we didn't see the alligator.
[120:02.47]Hey, well, it's from your perspective.
[120:03.99]I'll review your footage.
[120:05.15]You can see your clip.
[120:07.06]Yeah, but then you see me laughing.
[120:10.02]That's fine.
[120:10.50]That means it was a funny time.
[120:12.48]What if it wasn't so funny?
[120:13.96]What if it wasn't funny?
[120:15.67]You're like, wow, why is he laughing like that?
[120:16.87]We'll just never stream with you again.
[120:18.13]No problem.
[120:20.57]Alright.
[120:25.32]It was funny.
[120:26.44]Oh, watch out.
[120:28.78]Poke, I'm like one of the weasels from Roger Rabbit.
[120:31.16]I think I'm so easy to please.
[120:33.86]Don't worry.
[120:35.10]Yeah, same.

[122:32.38]Poke, did you see the fart play where they had the fart sound effects on their soundboard for some reason?
[122:37.03]No.
[122:38.75]Alright.
[122:43.02]I'm actually really glad.
[122:44.44]Why did I not watch this before?
[122:49.03]That was a banger.
[122:49.71]Sir, I said to you.
[122:50.87]Sir, let me know if you smile.
[122:55.09]Here's the fart DJ chat.
[122:58.44]I don't know if this gets VOD muted, but I'm going to get it started.
[123:02.05]yeah that was too literal for me like if it was a little bit more obscure that it was a fart but way too on the nose alright Ster are you ready to run to the red x sure I'll follow you I'll just follow whatever you're doing so we need to go to what 40 27 40 27 I got I got it I got it for poke I'm gonna set it to poke
[123:30.32]I'm at the thing, by the way.
[123:31.76]I've arrived.
[123:32.70]And we need a grappling hook to get up there.
[123:34.90]Oh, shit.
[123:36.36]Okay.
[123:36.48]Yeah, so it's a whole other thing.
[123:40.73]Alright.
[123:41.01]Well, we could play that other game.
[123:44.33]Because Ster said in DMs, hey, dude, like, get us out of this game.
[123:50.18]Lethal League.
[123:50.98]Oh, damn.
[123:53.48]Actually, that might be kind of fun.
[123:55.50]You want to do Lethal League right now?
[123:57.41]Or do you want to play that other one?
[123:58.92]Let's do it right now.
[124:00.34]Lethal League.
[124:02.28]Oh, if you've never played Lethal League, that's like a 10 out of 10 experience.
[124:07.29]Oh, you can play four players?
[124:08.15]Yeah, let's do it.
[124:08.93]Can you do four players?
[124:10.39]Yeah.
[124:11.37]Oh, shit.
[124:11.95]I'll download it right now.
[124:13.60]Smash Bros.
[124:14.40]Pong?
[124:16.42]Alright, I'll take a look at that.
[124:17.98]It is like an actual 10 out of 10 game.
[124:20.34]Wait, is this the first time we've ever stopped playing a game?
[124:23.65]No.
[124:24.01]No, right?
[124:26.59]No, we've pivoted.
[124:28.84]Is it Lethal League Blaze?
[124:30.76]I forget.
[124:31.18]That was the newer one.
[124:31.90]It is Lethal League.
[124:33.71]Yeah, it's the one on Steam.
[124:35.05]Lethal League Blaze, I think.
[124:38.43]In Green Hell, the grappling hook is found at the overturned Jeep along the mud road leading from the drug camp in survival mode.
[124:45.77]So, yeah, this spot on the map here, you need another thing to do it.
[124:53.86]yeah I found the Jeep and I was driving it and I had the grapple hook I just didn't know I was like grappling from tree to tree while driving were you really you really found the Jeep though no did you get the oh I'm sorry I need to get a controller if we're gonna do this oh you have to go to the store and buy one I use controllers like they're consumables when I'm done with the game I throw it out the window
[125:24.88]Alright, we want to take a quick break and pee and get situated and then we'll play Lethal League?
[125:29.59]Yes, sir.
[125:30.93]Yes.
[125:31.98]I'm going to jam out to this music.
[125:37.73]Check out that video I posted, Poke, and all the rest of you too, of course, but Poke, I think you'll enjoy that if you haven't seen it.
[126:01.60]I'm going to open the game.
[126:02.94]Hopefully it's not loud.
[126:03.92]I'm trying to get my headphones out.
[126:05.57]It's real.
[126:08.29]Fuck, that's good.
[126:12.11]I'm so glad I took my headphones out.
[126:13.78]That's real, yeah.
[126:16.88]Holy shit, I'm so happy about that.
[126:18.14]Guys, listen very carefully.
[126:22.81]Turn your fucking volume down when you open this.
[126:26.19]Wherever you're feeding it through.
[126:28.70]Okay.
[126:28.86]Okay.
[126:31.69]This game came out 11 years ago.
[126:35.81]It's a great one, but yeah, definitely turn your volume down.
[126:37.98]You're going to blow your ears out if you don't, if you have your volume loud enough.
[126:41.70]I think I'm good.
[126:43.48]I like the triple, like the one after the triple.
[126:47.97]Yeah, it's like, why is that even on the soundboard?
[127:00.36]Okay.
[127:01.84]I'm going to pee.
[127:02.45]I'll be right back.
