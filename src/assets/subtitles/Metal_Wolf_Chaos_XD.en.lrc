[00:01.39]Alright, now I gotta change the title.
[00:02.42]What should I change the title to?
[00:03.44]This is a FromSoftware game, by the way.
[00:05.06]What?
[00:05.84]What?
[00:06.34]Wait, this is FromSoftware?
[00:09.02]Yeah, FromSoftware.
[00:10.72]Here's how FromSoftware was a part of this game.
[00:13.48]I think, like, two people walked into the office of the people making this game.
[00:18.37]From, From, FromSoftware.
[00:20.61]And, like, drank out of the water cooler and looked at what they were making and said, yeah, that looks alright.
[00:25.93]I don't think they had very much to do with this.
[00:27.25]Maybe they did.
[00:27.65]Alright, Metal Wolf Chaos.
[00:32.27]I need a title, though.
[00:37.77]Title.
[00:38.35]Metal Wolf Chaos.
[00:39.19]FromSoftware made this.
[00:40.73]Please click.
[00:47.39]Metal Wolf Boppin'.
[00:49.18]I like that.
[00:52.82]Metal Wolf Boppin'.
[00:53.98]Brackets.
[00:54.76]FromSoftware made this.
[00:55.76]Did you know that?
[00:56.38]Click my stream.
[00:57.08]Please watch the whole thing.
[00:59.70]I like Metal Wolf Boppin'.
[01:04.39]Now this one, people said I was going to really like this.
[01:16.70]What do you think?
[01:17.08]Am I going to like this?
[01:18.06]Is this like a mech kind of jump around and shooter game?
[01:22.90]This is going to be loud.
[01:23.54]I've got to protect you guys' ears for a second.
[01:25.14]Hold on.
[01:34.73]I'm late to play this game.
[01:39.91]I'm late to play every game.
[01:42.43]The only games that I've ever played on release have been the FromSoftware games.
[01:45.60]Fuck, you're right.
[01:47.22]I should have played this like two weeks ago.
[01:52.08]FromSoftware presents.
[01:53.22]Hold on.
[01:53.58]Yeah, I play every FromSoftware game at launch.
[01:57.63]And I didn't play this.
[01:59.89]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:01.07]I can't see it.
[02:04.82]We can't see it?
[02:05.95]Here we go.
[02:06.97]What?
[02:07.17]Let's party!
[02:13.11]Let's party!
[02:39.25]Good sneaking job.
[02:41.13]Do I just pick it up right now?
[02:47.28]Play now?
[02:53.74]I guess not.
[02:54.72]Yeah, I'm gonna turn this up a little.
[03:11.41]I don't have any idea what's going on.
[03:17.61]I know this is just constant conflict, that's it.
[03:20.50]Do you really need to know anything else?
[03:23.18]Or just constant conflict, that's it, and just hold down left mouse button.
[03:41.48]Alright.
[03:51.44]I'm the president?
[03:54.69]Believe in your own justice.
[04:03.79]Metal Wolf Chaos by FromSoftware.
[04:09.71]We gotta work on this for a second, though.
[04:11.31]Hold on.
[04:11.73]Graphics.
[04:13.67]Quality.
[04:14.41]Get that out of here.
[04:15.77]Get that off.
[04:19.01]Quality high.
[04:19.78]Use those settings.
[04:22.52]Um, display.
[04:23.48]This is important, because this is full screen.
[04:25.40]This is not full screen.
[04:27.24]I'm already... We already got... I think this is a 30 FPS game.
[04:30.98]Should I do controller?
[04:33.08]I think I'm gonna just... No, I'll do mouse.
[04:34.46]It's probably easier to aim.
[04:36.50]That's alright.
[04:41.45]Keybinding sound.
[04:42.47]Music volume.
[04:45.33]Nobody wants to listen to this.
[04:50.48]Voice volume.
[04:51.22]Keep that up.
[04:55.64]You do?
[04:56.02]I didn't think you did.
[04:56.98]It was designed with the original Xbox in mind.
[05:02.83]Bust that out.
[05:04.15]Yeah?
[05:06.85]Yeah, I'm into it.
[05:10.11]Hold on, let me clarify.
[05:15.72]Dude, hold on.
[05:16.86]Dude!
[05:21.16]No, I know I'm gonna stick with the mouse.
[05:22.60]For now.
[05:23.58]If I hate it, I'll switch.
[05:25.34]And you'll tell.
[05:28.06]You'll be able to tell, because I'll be like, this is fucking stupid, it's fucking not even fun, it's only fucking fun if the fucking controller's still fucking in.
[05:34.72]It's like, it's just not even fun.
[05:36.08]Like, when I do that, you know that it's real.
[05:41.63]Put voice on max.
[05:44.16]Sure.
[05:45.78]I'm going to take the volume of the music down.
[05:47.54]I don't like when music is just playing in my ears.
[05:51.02]I know, some of you Sonic the Hedgehog fans are going to be really mad about this.
[05:53.80]Alright, let me take a look at the key mining.
[06:01.59]There's probably not going to be much of a tutorial.
[06:04.65]Jump, boost.
[06:05.73]Yeah, left shift, change weapons.
[06:07.11]Middle mouse.
[06:08.77]Left mouse, right mouse.
[06:10.45]W, S, A, D. Taunt is T. Burst attack.
[06:18.33]Burst attack, stomp.
[06:19.49]We'll do... Well, I'll change that.
[06:20.83]Burst attack with a stomp will beat this mouse.
[06:24.59]Alright, this seems easy enough.
[06:27.67]Yeah, let's go.
[06:30.26]I do have a gamer mouse.
[06:31.20]I have a razor death adder.
[06:35.21]Because it's the only mouse that is big enough for my big fucking wide palms.
[06:44.90]Alright, here we go.
[06:46.94]New game.
[06:49.71]Sellout?
[06:50.29]No, no, no.
[06:50.85]I don't think anything else from Razer is worth playing.
[06:53.23]I think I've already talked about this already.
[06:54.49]Alright, here we go.
[07:05.87]By the end of the first quarter of the 21st century, freedom was dead in America.
[07:12.89]Beginning with a large-scale military coup d'etat that erupted in various cities throughout the nation, the rebels seized power in all the central institutions of government.
[07:24.99]The entire nation appeared to have fallen completely into the hands of the coup d'etat forces.
[07:30.66]However, one final hope in opposing the coup d'etat forces remained.
[07:35.52]this final hope being the u.s president himself Michael wilson the 47th president of the united states equipped with a special mobile armored ops suit developed in secret by the military boldly waged his own personal war alone to take back America's freedom I do appreciate the like 12k audio bit right
[08:03.69]Get out my special ops suit, Jody.
[08:05.33]That's back in the day when it used to be like CD quality from the drop down in your Windows menu.
[08:12.56]This kind of party is a first for me.
[08:17.00]Mr. President?
[08:25.69]You're gonna burst through the door.
[08:30.51]Welcome to the White House.
[08:33.67]Alright.
[08:35.13]Oh, God.
[08:35.39]Okay, so... How much damage?
[08:36.15]How much my health bar?
[08:37.41]Oh, shit.
[09:02.52]Alright, where am I going?
[09:05.02]Do I have any other weapons or just that shotgun?
[09:07.86]Oh, I didn't know my right clicked.
[09:20.17]So is it auto-aim during the square?
[09:21.83]I think it is.
[09:22.43]Seems like it.
[09:33.78]That square is huge, it is.
[09:35.32]You got it!
[09:35.70]I'm on my way!
[09:35.98]I wish I could voice for this.
[09:54.76]You got it, Judy.
[09:55.84]I'm making my way down through it.
[09:58.06]Anything you say, Judy.
[09:59.25]That'd be good.
[09:59.83]I'll be back.
[10:00.35]Better.
[10:25.33]How long does that boost go?
[10:26.28]Whoa, what the hell was that?
[10:27.34]What?
[10:27.48]That seems... Whoa.
[10:28.40]How do I select them?
[10:29.16]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[10:32.76]Is there like a way to move up and down on them?
[10:34.84]Current, current, current.
[10:36.40]I don't think...
[10:54.89]How do I change them?
[10:58.01]Scroll?
[10:59.89]Yeah, scroll on.
[11:02.44]I'm trying to scroll, it doesn't do anything.
[11:06.12]You click?
[11:16.83]Because the middle mouse opens it, and then scrolling doesn't do anything, and I don't have access to anything.
[11:21.18]Oh wait, there we go, there we go.
[11:22.06]You actually just have to... Okay, I get it, I get it.
[11:23.70]You have to click left and right mouse.
[11:30.37]Cool.
[11:32.45]Alright, nice.
[11:33.07]I'm ready.
[11:33.41]Bingo!
[11:43.83]I kind of want to speed up the turn.
[11:45.10]Let's just target the target.
[11:47.20]Just waiting for the air to break.
[11:49.12]Yeah, if you aim and fire.
[12:15.71]Oh, there's that FromSoftware dodge that I like.
[12:21.01]How is this not hitting me?
[12:23.83]That's it?
[12:24.27]Oh, I'm hitting the Grail in front.
[12:35.55]Nice.
[12:40.49]Enemy's behind.
[12:43.14]Where?
[12:44.56]Watch out!
[12:45.18]Oh my god, he's getting destroyed.
[12:51.05]Rocket launcher kind of sucks.
[12:53.43]If it hits the guard rail, it doesn't hurt.
[12:59.96]Guard.
[13:03.30]Rail.
[13:11.70]Air Force One's launch preparations will be complete soon.
[13:14.67]That's Air Force One.
[13:15.67]Well, we're working here.
[13:17.01]More guests!
[13:18.25]Well, I guess they won't be voting for you next term, Mr. President.
[13:23.03]Air Force One, protected!
[13:25.13]Please be careful.
[13:31.15]Ooh, I like it.
[13:32.21]This is fun.
[13:44.68]What else we got?
[13:45.43]Up in the, up at the top?
[13:48.83]Can I ever move the HUD?
[13:59.38]You're not gonna touch here, so I'm gonna get like an S-rated for this one.
[14:06.10]Anybody else?
[14:08.89]No?
[14:09.81]I'm good.
[14:12.53]Oh, what?
[14:12.73]Oh no, he got it off!
[14:31.64]That one guy saved, uh, whatever they're fighting.
[14:36.28]I don't even know who's fighting.
[14:38.76]Who am I fighting?
[14:41.23]What is this?
[14:41.77]Is this like, what invasion?
[14:43.27]Who am I even fighting?
[14:49.29]Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[15:03.33]Whoa!
[15:04.65]What?
[15:05.19]Oh.
[15:15.24]Like they were ever invited, they're definitely... Michael!
[15:18.40]Richard!
[15:19.92]Richard!
[15:30.99]Mr. President, it looks like this party is just getting started.
[15:35.64]D. Alright, but E. C. Rush combo points.
[15:50.90]What's that mean?
[15:57.27]Display KO point details.
[15:58.91]That's what I want to see.
[16:02.15]Uh, President Michael Wilson's flight from the White House prevented Vice President Richard Hawkes holding the country.
[16:07.65]With the Pentagon, Congress, and every other core institution of America firmly in its grasp, Hawke was free to thrust his depravity upon the country in the name of revolution.
[16:14.80]The land of the free was free no more.
[16:16.96]But let me tell you the story of a man who stood against that tide, who believed in his own justice even when it seemed the whole country had turned against him.
[16:24.98]DNN correspondent Peter McDonald.
[16:27.02]Jody, update me as to the status of the nation.
[16:32.99]The Pentagon, the United Nations, and all central government institutions have fallen into the hands of the vice president.
[16:42.61]Have they?
[16:43.27]I feel like this is part of that dream game.
[16:46.35]Mr. President, believe in your own justice.
[16:52.19]I'm sure your father would have told you the same.
[16:56.61]Jody, how's my schedule look for today?
[16:58.95]OK.
[17:01.71]This is freaking me out more than the other one was.
[17:03.77]I can't make it.
[17:04.35]I have to save America.
[17:05.31]We'll have to do dinner on Tuesday instead.
[17:25.58]Yes, Mr. President.
[17:35.09]To my beloved fellow Americans, good evening.
[17:39.54]This is an announcement from the Government Policy Promotion Department, your American justice and freedom supporter.
[17:51.75]every one of you is this recent events were not a mere coup d'etat but rather a revolution to correct the wrongs in the United States of America to our regret our nation is in a crisis situation
[18:10.19]since 2010 domestic terrorism problems have increased rapidly economic disputes originating from the exhaustion of fossil fuels and the sudden rise in unemployment due to the influx of large-scale immigration neither the current president nor the American government took actions to address these various problems
[18:34.61]On the contrary, they have filled their own pockets adhering to terrorist cells.
[18:41.57]To correct this situation, Richard Hawk, Arizona insurrection hero and vice president of the old government and the U.S.
[18:52.40]military rose to the task at hand.
[18:56.94]Much like our ancestors did, based in a belief of winning freedom,
[19:03.11]and based in the belief of an independent war, and based in the belief in this great nation.
[19:13.01]However, to our regret, an evil to disobey this belief exists in the United States of America too.
[19:23.82]And here is that evil.
[19:28.55]This villainous terrorist, who first appeared in Washington and began his unjust rampage, goes by the alias Metal Wolf.
[19:40.72]His current whereabouts are unknown.
[19:43.80]While all of America will be under martial law until Metal Wolf is caught, please do not confuse the issues at hand.
[19:53.78]without fail the u.s military elite forces with a combined strength of 1.5 million promise to smash this unforgivable evil to pieces this has been an announcement from the government policy promotion department your special remedy for all kinds of evil evil alright
[20:25.43]White House.
[20:25.99]Reach Air Force One.
[20:26.87]We did it.
[20:28.73]Now we have San Francisco.
[20:30.49]So we're getting... Getting attacked in San Francisco.
[20:34.18]Alright.
[20:34.38]Economy.
[20:35.78]Technology.
[20:36.62]Energy pod.
[20:37.50]What does this mean?
[20:41.68]Alright.
[20:41.90]We go here.
[20:44.54]Is this all I can do now?
[20:46.32]Anything else?
[20:46.73]I guess we go in here.
[20:49.96]the coup d'etat army that occupies San Francisco still runs rampant and deprives 780 000 citizens of their freedom target areas that the enemy force uses as the base of their military activities are built around the town okay
[21:08.90]Target areas where enemy forces are concentrated are dangerous, but you can weaken their morale by destroying enemy armies Destroy all target areas Annihilate the enemy force and make the liberation of San Francisco shine as a beacon of hope in your counter offensive I think they literally got this voice actor to speak over the phone What's the call name?
[21:38.21]Okay.
[21:38.93]Gotta have a drum roll.
[21:46.37]Here we go.
[21:48.53]Alright.
[21:49.35]Ooh!
[21:49.85]You actually get to make your own, um... Loadout.
[21:52.68]That's cool.
[21:53.12]Alright.
[21:53.40]Equip.
[21:53.70]How much money do I have?
[21:54.84]Total money.
[21:55.70]15,210.
[21:55.84]Alright.

[22:29.66]Oh, but what do I want the next one?
[22:36.20]Missile launchers.
[22:37.16]Mmm.
[22:38.52]Looking for tracking capabilities.
[22:41.32]Grenade launchers, sniper cannons, rail guns, multi-missile launchers, flamethrowers.
[22:47.12]I want a flamethrower.
[22:49.76]Yes.
[22:52.80]So this is now available for development.
[22:56.33]Okay, so I can have an FLT-350.
[22:57.55]Nice.
[22:57.81]Okay.
[23:03.77]So now manufacture, flamethrower is... Shit.
[23:10.89]Rare metal required?
[23:13.95]How much do I have?
[23:18.88]Insufficient money.
[23:20.44]Damn it.
[23:20.96]Okay.
[23:22.14]It's alright.
[23:23.90]I'll be able to do that next.
[23:24.78]Alright, equip.
[23:29.78]Shotgun.
[23:30.24]No, this is fine.
[23:30.88]This is like level 2.
[23:31.80]It's alright.
[23:37.58]Oh no, Mr. President.
[23:40.20]You left the office with a briefcase full of hundreds and that's it.
[23:43.78]You only had 15 grand.
[23:47.22]What are you gonna do now?
[23:48.10]Uh, enemy list now.
[23:54.01]Alright, let's go.
[24:07.17]Start.
[24:14.17]Meanwhile, in the skies above San Francisco... Mr. President, how's the skydiving?
[24:21.12]Not too bad.
[24:23.74]San Francisco, occupied by coup d'etat forces, will be the starting point of our counteroffensive.
[24:31.40]Mr. President, how's the skydiving?
[24:34.10]And here's the starting grid.
[24:38.16]Talk like you're in the wind.
[24:41.94]The correct direction there is there's a loud vacuum cleaner and you're trying to have a conversation.
[24:46.33]Here we go.
[25:02.55]Annihilate the enemy army by destroying the target areas where the troops have amassed.
[25:06.83]Destroy all the target areas scattered... Give me, uh... No, give me... I want the rocket launcher on this.
[25:11.27]I'm a sniper, alright?
[25:13.49]And then I want the rocket launcher here.
[25:14.57]Got it.
[25:24.94]Or, how about bazookas?
[25:25.86]Alright, give me a... I want something better around here.
[25:28.74]Yeah, I want this.
[25:29.48]And then, give me a... Give me this shotgun.
[25:31.16]Alright, we're gonna save with this thing.
[25:33.36]Alright, here we go.
[25:53.19]What's this?
[25:54.67]Oh, ammo.
[26:03.65]And then he's stringing the chain together, right?
[26:08.89]Hello?
[26:14.94]Oh, ammo!
[26:15.38]You have buildings!
[26:16.24]Okay.
[26:18.52]Anybody else?
[26:19.02]I think that's it.
[26:20.72]No?
[26:21.02]Good.
[26:25.35]Mr. President, POWs are being transported in that cage.
[26:29.61]Destroy the cage with light firearms and rescue the people inside.
[26:33.59]This is light, right?
[26:40.12]Scientists?
[26:40.46]Alright.
[26:41.02]So, save the people in the cases and get rid of the bad guys.
[26:43.98]What do you mean get- oh, they- I mean they're on it.
[27:11.84]Helicopter?
[27:12.46]Okay.
[27:13.08]I gotta get a bazooka here.
[27:15.18]Hit!
[27:15.30]Hit!
[27:44.27]I'm definitely doing missiles.
[27:46.45]Missiles only.
[27:53.73]I want a double.
[27:54.25]I want missiles on either hand.
[27:58.95]Heavy arms ammo.
[28:00.03]What's that?
[28:01.57]It's shield unit.
[28:03.03]Cool.
[28:12.59]Should I do double flamethrower?
[28:14.26]Just glide around and do flamethrower?
[28:15.78]I think that sounds like fun.
[28:22.48]No, don't.
[28:23.18]I blew it up.
[28:23.58]I didn't mean to.
[28:25.00]But it happened.
[28:26.02]No!
[28:26.32]Shit!
[28:26.66]I did, uh...
[28:43.34]What's that?
[28:44.38]MP7?
[28:44.92]No, that's fine.
[28:52.41]Let's go this way.
[28:55.45]She told... I thought I told you!
[28:58.25]Don't do that!
[28:59.17]Alright, let me try to get like a 20 or 30 chain here.
[29:16.02]There's gotta be more people on the screen if we can get a better chain.
[29:20.26]The target with the spinning antenna is the enemy's communications facility.
[29:27.14]From this facility, when communications are made, large numbers of reinforcements... I missed loot?
[29:32.83]It's really a nuisance, so destroy it first.
[29:47.90]I'll get it.
[29:48.22]I'll get it.
[29:48.52]Come on.
[29:49.80]Bonus rare metal.
[29:50.94]Ooh.
[29:53.37]I should just be blowing up all this shit, right?
[30:00.61]What did I do?
[30:01.17]I missed something here?
[30:04.40]There it is.
[30:08.04]Shield unit.
[30:12.74]Pick up the antennae.
[30:15.46]You can break stuff by dashing through it.
[30:16.80]That's good to know.
[30:17.34]Sick.
[30:21.45]Ah, you can.
[30:22.21]Oh, you can... I don't even... Yeah, that's so good to know.
[30:28.86]Thank you so much for telling me that.
[30:40.50]Whoa!
[30:40.96]Whoa.
[30:41.38]Are there bosses in this game?
[30:43.38]Yeah, there are.
[30:44.14]That's cool.
[30:45.03]Oh, I know.
[31:09.60]I'll take care of it.
[31:13.75]Can you shoot two things at the same time?
[31:15.99]Yes.
[31:16.23]Oh, shit.
[31:22.79]I'm out of ammo.
[31:25.48]Uh-oh.
[31:29.24]I'm at 49.
[31:29.80]That's enough, right?
[31:39.37]I just hit the damn sign.
[31:50.70]Don't ask chat, 99% have never seen the game before.
[31:54.51]Yeah, but some people have.
[31:56.57]There's like one person in here that's played this whole game and has S ranking on every level.
[32:08.64]Oh shit.
[32:09.06]Where's my health bar?
[32:10.44]Is it the top right?
[32:11.30]That teal bar on the top right?
[32:23.11]No item?
[32:23.65]What do you mean failed?
[32:43.45]On the left.
[32:45.60]Oh shit, you're right.
[32:53.20]What does it say?
[32:54.78]Nice?
[32:55.00]M939 Nice?
[32:55.78]What does it say?
[33:01.02]Nice?
[33:05.23]What is the bopping for in the title?
[33:08.95]I can't really explain it.
[33:11.09]The first hour of the stream will explain why the title is Metal Gear Pop... Bop... Not Metal Gear.
[33:20.09]Metal... Whatever this is.
[33:27.62]It's, you know, like, roll my hand and spin it around a few times and slap my wrist back and forth, put my finger and my palm up to my mouth, lean forward and say, you got to be there.
[33:36.34]You know that thing that I do?
[33:58.48]How would I successfully explain what bopping is?
[34:03.91]I can't.
[34:04.77]How would I do that?
[34:05.47]It's not possible.
[34:06.15]I want to use those pointblows bad.
[34:23.74]Look at all that.
[34:24.28]Look at all those yellow circles.
[34:27.08]Come on, I gotta keep it going.
[34:33.39]Chain, chain, chain.
[34:34.13]Nope.
[34:34.31]Not gonna get it.
[34:36.49]Oh, but, by the way, I didn't really talk about what's happening tomorrow.
[34:48.66]Tomorrow?
[34:49.26]Wait.
[34:49.40]Target?
[34:50.08]What the?
[34:50.87]Destroy all this stuff?
[34:52.67]Oh, like it's the whole building.
[35:12.49]I'm getting, like, a real bad, like, lady-is-drunk vibe.
[35:19.39]Ooh, look at this.
[35:28.24]Take out the support beam?
[35:31.32]I need more than just this rocket launcher if I'm gonna do this.
[35:40.38]Oh, anyways, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.
[35:42.20]So tomorrow, I have bought an Xbox 360 for one reason.
[35:47.46]I bought the old, not the Kinect, the thing that came before the Kinect.
[35:52.02]It only was available for like two games.
[35:53.99]It's the Xbox Live Vision Camera.
[35:57.73]And it's called You're in the Movies.
[36:00.57]Not the U-Star one.
[36:01.61]This is before U-Star.
[36:02.93]This is the first one.
[36:04.73]So, it's going to be a fucked up screen tomorrow.
[36:08.54]I can guarantee you that.
[36:12.36]Press F for you, super.
[36:14.72]It's not.
[36:15.17]I just pressed... You got me to press F. Is there a better way I can do this?
[36:21.35]I feel like this is... Oh, no.
[36:22.65]I'm out of... I'm out of ammo.
[36:32.74]Missile alert.
[36:33.62]Oh, you weren't lying.
[36:35.38]Missile alert.
[36:36.50]Missile alert.
[36:37.54]Where did it go?
[36:40.69]Oh, okay.
[36:44.39]Right, right, right, right.
[36:45.51]Okay, I get you.
[36:49.55]Yeah, that's tomorrow.
[36:56.07]Tomorrow's Terraria.
[36:57.42]No, Terraria's getting moved to Sunday.
[37:00.48]Tomorrow is Xbox 360.
[37:04.08]Green screen, fuckface stream.
[37:11.11]Here we go.
[37:12.07]What about ammo?
[37:12.57]Drunk.
[37:13.03]I can't hurt this.
[37:13.75]I need something better than that.
[37:31.69]What's going on?
[37:32.17]Am I sniping?
[37:34.17]Why am I standing still?
[37:38.81]Stop!
[37:39.21]Stop!
[37:39.51]I don't want to stand still!
[37:40.53]How do I get out?
[37:41.15]I don't want to be sniping!
[38:02.43]Mr. President.
[38:03.85]Mr. President.
[38:05.31]Mr. President.
[38:06.53]Snake, yeah.
[38:08.45]Oh no, I don't want to do this again.
[38:10.17]Fuck.
[38:11.69]Oh my god.
[38:12.81]What the hell?
[38:14.03]Alright.
[38:18.11]I don't know.
[38:21.48]I had the sniper out before and it didn't zoom in.
[38:23.40]I couldn't get it off.
[38:26.34]I tried to take off the sniper and it wouldn't do anything.
[38:41.19]I think he didn't light the bonfire.
[38:42.75]No, he didn't.
[38:43.19]Alright, let's just go.
[38:53.98]I don't need to destroy these.
[38:58.51]I know where I'm going.
[39:04.24]This is a bootleg Armored Core.
[39:05.72]Here's the funny thing about that.
[39:07.86]This is the same company.
[39:09.44]FromSoftware, they actually made this.
[39:11.80]Don't walk in front of me.
[39:14.91]I want to get a better weapon, though.
[39:27.80]The shotgun's fine on here, but I need the ammo.
[39:30.56]That's fine.
[39:31.40]The enemy forces have even captured San Francisco's cable cars.
[39:35.70]We can't let them get away with using the symbol of this great American city.
[39:39.51]No, and I didn't.
[39:45.17]The yellow icons on your radar are designated targets in each area.
[39:49.05]Destroy each target and blow the area to oblivion.
[39:52.08]Reinforcements come from the adjacent areas.
[39:54.56]When there are too many reinforcements,
[39:57.24]I don't want to use that much of this, though, because I need it later.
[40:00.01]That tank.
[40:04.17]Mr. President!
[40:05.05]Mr. President!
[40:06.85]Mr. President!
[40:07.93]Mr. President!
[40:10.81]Happy, sad, excited.
[40:14.54]Say it all different ways.
[40:17.26]Give me your best, I'm sad, Mr. President.
[40:19.92]I'll give you your best, I'm happy, Mr. President.
[40:27.41]The target with its spinning antenna is the enemy's communications facility.
[40:31.83]From this facility, when communications are made, large numbers of reinforcements join the battle.
[40:37.53]It's really a nuisance, so destroy it first.
[40:44.22]I'm on it.
[40:45.82]Michigan report from hell.
[40:48.94]That game was insane.
[40:49.88]Machine guns with a high rapid fire rate are effective here.
[40:53.28]Try out the weapons in your backpack as you like.
[41:02.23]Michigan Report from Hell was... because I had to play that on like a weird emulator because it wasn't localized.
[41:09.35]That was a Japanese game, right?
[41:10.60]I don't think that even released in the United States.
[41:20.90]Alright, we're going quicker this time.
[41:22.22]EU.
[41:27.61]Yeah, but that's a PAL console.
[41:29.93]I didn't have a PAL console.
[41:52.28]Make sure to use your rush when the circle is flashing.
[41:54.19]Oh, I'll give it a try.
[41:57.03]Wait!
[41:58.55]Let me save these people.
[42:04.55]No items dropped.
[42:06.11]Got it.
[42:06.49]That is actually really, really effective.
[42:22.81]somebody said I can't tell the scale of anything this game it's just a lot of running shooting sprinting dashing wait till I get that flank bro
[42:42.90]Yeah, how big am I?
[42:44.02]Am I just a guy in what kind of Fallout armor?
[42:46.62]I'm not supposed to be like 100 feet tall, right?
[42:48.48]What?
[42:48.62]Which one is it?
[42:50.04]You're supposed to be 5'7".
[42:50.98]Nice!
[42:51.22]That's pretty big!
[42:51.85]Okay.
[43:13.25]Five-eight.
[43:17.34]Shut up.
[43:19.20]Shut up.
[43:23.14]I think you're a five-seven in this game.
[43:25.04]I don't know.
[43:31.65]Let's look at the official documentation of the game manual.
[43:48.18]Imagine being short.
[43:49.32]Hey, imagine being a dick.
[44:01.49]I got ya!
[44:07.65]No bullets.
[44:08.23]Alright.
[44:08.52]No, no, no.
[44:08.84]I don't want to waste these.
[44:11.20]Here we go.
[44:12.30]Nope.
[44:12.70]After this, it comes a tank, and then it... I'll take care of it.
[44:15.12]I got the... No, this is... It's epic building.
[44:26.51]The boomer is fuming.
[44:27.47]Boomer.
[44:27.83]I can't wait till you guys are like 30.
[44:36.43]You'll be like, oh, I feel bad after all those boomer comments.
[44:39.47]Because I don't know what it's like to fucking roll out of bed if my back hurts because I slept on it wrong for like an hour.
[44:45.72]You'll know.
[44:46.06]You'll see.
[44:47.54]You'll see.
[44:48.04]Now that's it, right?
[44:55.56]Is there more down here?
[44:57.54]Defensive argument?
[44:59.72]No, augment.
[45:13.40]Defensive streamer.
[45:15.80]Something like that.
[45:16.80]Something like that.
[45:21.66]Light arms ammo.
[45:22.64]Okay, is there any more famous ammo back here?
[45:35.80]Whatever.
[45:42.75]There was something back here.
[45:43.97]No, there wasn't.
[45:44.45]I'm getting generated.
[45:48.58]Don't ban us.
[45:49.18]Why would I ban you?
[45:53.42]What if I happen to scare Saturdays?
[45:56.35]Let's scare Saturday.
[45:57.79]I'm going to get rid of those two, but let's go.
[46:01.27]Let's get in close.
[46:02.91]Go!
[46:03.07]Come on, bring it down.
[46:05.21]Come on.
[46:26.93]This is fucking weird.
[46:28.77]What do you mean it's weird?
[46:31.35]What's wrong?
[46:31.93]What's the difference?
[46:33.27]This is a mech game.
[46:34.47]What do you mean it's weird?
[46:42.56]This game is weird.
[46:48.16]Come on, bring it down.
[46:49.56]Come on.
[46:53.21]I mean, I guess it is weird.
[46:54.31]You're right.
[47:03.23]Here we go.
[47:05.05]Alright, now this is where I gotta be careful, because I'm not gonna screw this up again.
[47:08.87]Get rid of the tank.
[47:10.05]Here it comes.
[47:11.09]Here we go.
[47:11.85]Here we go.
[47:24.66]I gotta watch that explosion.
[47:29.78]I feel like she's talking to me like I'm sick.
[47:33.70]Make junk food out of him!
[47:37.60]Turn him into... Turn him into... Turn him into a chicken nugget!
[47:41.52]Is he gonna... Because I am.
[47:44.20]No, I'm not.
[47:44.92]Okay.
[47:57.89]Is he vulnerable somewhere?
[48:00.39]This game's really weird.
[48:02.13]This game's not that weird.
[48:05.33]What is so weird about this game?
[48:08.89]Stop it.
[48:10.49]Oh, it's a weird game, huh?
[48:15.72]Why?
[48:18.24]It's like a mech shooter.
[48:20.44]Why is it so weird?
[48:25.17]This game's weird.
[48:26.21]What a fucking weird game.
[48:30.53]Okay, I don't want to lose again.
[48:31.91]So... Okay, I'm good.
[48:33.58]Are they even reaching?
[48:49.61]Shoot it in the gun.
[48:53.18]Right in the gun.
[49:01.44]Yeah, I gotta hit it right in the gun.
[49:10.10]Ah!
[49:12.26]I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[49:13.34]I'm not dead.
[49:13.72]Am I?
[49:13.96]Oh my god, why?
[49:14.70]What happened?
[49:16.38]What?
[49:17.32]Why did I just lose instantly?
[49:18.47]What happened?
[49:22.98]What happened?
[49:23.28]I don't understand.
[49:28.44]Is it missiles?
[49:29.96]I have to do this whole thing again.
[49:48.77]Weird.
[49:48.95]What a weird game.
[49:50.01]It's...
[49:55.81]Flay the Shire thing.
[49:57.00]I gotta pee.
[50:02.80]Hold on.
[50:03.16]Wait, wait, wait.
[50:04.24]I need to upgrade.
[50:05.64]Fuck.
[50:06.28]I shouldn't have bought the flamethrower.
[50:07.34]This is a mistake.
[50:08.94]I gotta upgrade.
[50:09.66]You're not supposed to win there.
[50:10.72]This is a FromSoftware game.
[50:12.89]I just walked up to the third boss.
[50:15.43]I need to get souls and upgrade my guy.
[50:17.13]I have to upgrade my... Go to my garage and upgrade my character.
[50:19.69]That's just what it is.
[50:21.15]Alright, I'm gonna pee.
[50:21.65]I'll be right back.
[53:12.77]Dude, did I seriously pick the flamethrower, which is expensive, and I screwed everything up?
[53:21.15]I played a FromSoftware game, and I put, like, six points into faith in the very beginning of the game.
[53:28.92]What the hell did I do that for?
[53:32.40]Alright.
[53:36.84]Let's get this fresh beer open.
[53:46.22]Alright.
[53:47.60]Develop.
[53:47.90]Can I do anything else?
[53:50.70]Manufacture.
[53:51.48]Like a new shield.
[53:55.65]I should have manufactured one of these.
[54:05.15]Missile launchers, grenade launchers, sniper guns, rail guns.
[54:08.06]I need to just do explosives.
[54:10.60]Like grenade launcher or something.
[54:12.12]Damn it.
[54:12.78]Why did I pick flamethrower?
[54:14.12]Why did you guys let me do this?
[54:22.80]Just redo the first level.
[54:24.84]I can do that.
[54:25.28]Oh, I can do that.
[54:26.64]I can do that.
[54:27.30]You're right.
[54:30.86]I can do that.
[54:31.70]Oh my god, you're right.
[54:32.92]I can do this.
[54:33.84]Yeah, alright.
[54:35.72]FromSoftware.
[54:37.10]Let's go.
[54:46.39]Get out my special ops suit, Jody.
[54:53.54]Alright, yeah, I'm ready.
[54:54.80]Give me like a 30 chain.
[54:56.60]100 chain.
[54:56.98]Get some money and then I'm going to upgrade my missile launchers.
[55:18.94]Already grinding on the first level.
[55:22.08]Kind of, but not really.
[55:24.58]I would call this a mini-grind.
[55:25.76]This is not a real grind.
[55:27.38]Oh, by the way, I didn't talk about this, too.
[55:30.02]At some point after the Carnival stream... I'm not going to do it yet, but it's going to happen at some point in September.
[55:39.16]I'm going to be pulling the streams back start time by about an hour or two.
[55:48.28]I'm gonna be starting my streams somewhere around this time.
[55:56.32]Like, between, like... Well, not now, I mean, like, you know, a couple hours ago.
[56:02.45]And the reason for that is because... My streams have been going... Much more than, like, four hours like they ever used to.
[56:13.18]Before I moved to Vegas, my streams were, like, four to five hours long.
[56:16.93]They're starting to become 6, 7, 8 hours long.
[56:19.89]More than half the time, I'd say.
[56:23.92]And what ends up happening is if I start my stream at 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon, after that, like, 6, 7, 8 hour period, it starts to become, like, 2, 3, 4, 5 o'clock in the morning Eastern.
[56:36.73]And who God knows how long EU.
[56:42.17]Like, how much time it is EU.
[56:45.48]So, I've decided that I don't want to have my streams, because they've been going late.
[56:49.45]They have been.
[56:57.73]That's kind of the theory.
[57:00.87]Because it used to be, you know, I'd start at like 7 o'clock Eastern and my streams would end at like 11 or 12 Eastern.
[57:06.12]They didn't go for that long.
[57:13.47]Holy shit, I'm gonna get a lot of points for this.
[57:16.63]I forgot to move.
[57:17.27]I need 250.
[57:17.87]Come on.
[57:18.17]Alright, I'm good.
[57:21.53]Let's go.
[57:28.25]That was one of the things I wanted to talk about, though.
[57:38.17]Keep the chain going.
[57:39.91]Eh, 265 is fine.
[57:42.60]This mission is so short.
[57:44.00]So it'll be fine.
[57:45.28]I also have this thing.
[57:46.20]I'm just going to use it.
[57:47.58]But I think it's better for everybody.
[57:49.24]Being on Pacific time is...
[58:12.03]As far back as I could possibly be.
[58:18.39]Come on.
[58:23.03]Come on.
[58:23.73]Did I go too fast?
[58:24.57]Oh, there we go.
[58:29.65]Yeah, but I guess I could be in Hawaii.
[58:45.82]And I can notice when, you know, when people start to get tired and... It's to be 1, 2, 3 o'clock.
[58:52.70]Every stream in the last few months, pretty much, I think like 80% of every stream has gone to like at least 2 or 3 a.m.
[59:01.95]I never used to do that before I moved here.
[59:09.57]I'd much rather have the streams end around 11-12 Eastern than be still chugging along.
[59:17.30]Alright, I'm gonna get money for this.
[59:19.86]Put it into my missile launchers.
[59:37.37]From September?
[59:37.99]Yeah.
[59:38.11]Because I want enough time for people to know that that's going to happen.
[59:42.03]I don't want to just start... Like, today is kind of just... I'm just seeing how I like it.
[59:46.53]I would have started at, like, three or four, but... I'm just trying to see how much I like doing this.
[59:51.98]I'm going to do it a few times.
[59:54.14]But officially, I'm not going to say that yet.
[59:58.14]Probably after the carnival stream.
[59:59.84]Is when it'll be officially... My stream will be pulled back, like, two hours.
[60:07.04]Because it's easy for me to be like, yeah, as of today, streams are now going to start at 12.
[60:11.78]But that's not a reality.
[60:14.72]Alright, how much money do I get?
[60:21.15]So stream length will be the same.
[60:23.47]Just where it will be there, what period it will be.
[60:27.17]That's an S rank.
[60:38.86]That's an A. Rush combo?
[60:41.00]What is this rush combo?
[60:42.68]That's really bringing me down.
[60:46.26]That's fucking up my whole GPA.
[60:52.38]Well, that's how you get... That's $69,000.
[60:55.14]That's so... I'm... I did it correct this time.
[60:59.53]You have to be dashing.
[61:00.43]Alright, let's go to the garage.
[61:06.40]I'm ready.
[61:12.80]Develop.
[61:13.31]Here we go.
[61:15.07]Manufacturer.
[61:15.87]Let's get that flamethrower.
[61:25.49]Alright, let's get it.
[61:27.38]Develop this weapon.
[61:29.00]Yeah, I have one of them now.
[61:30.24]Alright.
[61:35.07]Investment.
[61:37.42]Handguns.
[61:37.98]Where are we going?
[61:38.46]We want multi-missile launchers, railguns, sniper cannons, grenades.
[61:42.58]Missile launchers.
[61:43.58]Develop.
[61:47.82]The ML-60ST is now available for development.
[61:52.06]Do it again.
[61:52.70]How much is that?
[61:53.20]Do it again.
[61:56.00]Oh, it'll go... VE is now available.
[62:00.31]Alright, I got 30 grand.
[62:01.95]Let's try, let's get some of these.
[62:04.23]ML, the ML6ST ham.
[62:09.62]Let's go to manufacture.
[62:11.12]Let's see, firepower, 1160.
[62:14.52]No, no, no, no, no, I want to look at it.
[62:19.41]Basic missile launcher offers a balanced set of capabilities.
[62:22.21]Fires missiles vertically.
[62:24.48]Specialized tracking capability.
[62:27.02]Lock on speed, F. Guidance system, S. Range, S.
[62:31.70]10, 60, 12, this is, I mean, this one's just better.
[62:39.63]I'll get it, I'll try it.
[62:41.31]I want this one too, though.
[62:46.65]Alright, grenade launchers, I don't have any.
[62:50.18]I definitely want more of these.
[62:52.96]Where are they?
[62:53.94]I want two of these.
[62:59.15]What?
[63:02.67]I need active research in here to be able to do this.
[63:07.67]Machine guns.
[63:08.39]How much is it?
[63:08.99]Let me go in investment.
[63:10.39]10,000.
[63:12.23]Let's just see.
[63:13.31]Let's get something.
[63:15.07]MP7 is now available.
[63:19.69]I can't make it, though.
[63:20.45]Alright, that should be alright, though.
[63:25.57]Let's go to equip.
[63:29.85]The handgun is alright, but... Flamethrower?
[63:38.58]No, I can... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[63:40.08]I can have another weapon here.
[63:41.32]Okay, that's cool.
[63:45.16]Where's my flamethrower?
[63:48.28]Get that on there.
[63:51.10]Oh, it has to be both hands.
[63:53.82]That's annoying.
[63:57.04]Well, the sniper rifle's stupid.
[63:58.88]It's not good.
[63:59.80]I don't want it.
[64:04.78]Let's do this one and then the ham.
[64:06.72]Okay.
[64:12.61]Shotgun, pistol, that's easy.
[64:14.73]These two are fine.
[64:15.77]And then... I definitely want to be able to have at least... Yeah, these two.
[64:19.41]That's good.
[64:21.75]Alright.
[64:22.57]Let's see if I can do any better this time and not lose at the last bossed instant wave.
[64:31.16]There we go.
[64:31.70]Save it.
[64:40.26]Go.
[64:46.55]Not messing around.
[64:47.61]I want to test him out though.
[64:49.96]So here's this.
[64:50.70]And here is this.
[64:51.56]Let's set the flamethrower first.
[64:53.29]Am I reloading it?
[64:54.51]Is it using the boost too?
[65:18.19]Now that's not good.
[65:18.95]It uses the boost.
[65:23.91]So I can't speed down the road and do it.
[65:26.95]Use the boost to get through it.
[65:28.71]I'll try.
[65:43.06]Some scientists were among the POWs you rescued.
[65:45.85]They were used to develop new weapons for the military.
[65:48.79]Move out of the way.
[65:50.13]Let's do... Let's do shotgun for this.
[65:53.41]Right in the beginning here, it's really not a big deal.
[65:56.65]I can just get through this.
[65:58.09]Once the towers become a thing.
[65:59.87]Now the POW can be safely liberated.
[66:03.65]That's when I'm moving on to the rocket launchers.
[66:08.05]We can't let them get away with using the symbol of this great American city.
[66:22.07]I also want to talk about the Highlights Activity Bookstream.
[66:26.81]I had the... I brought the mods together and we talked about it for a while.
[66:31.63]And it should be interesting.
[66:33.55]Don't... I'm not ready to give any dates or anything right this second.
[66:35.93]I want to.
[66:37.46]But by the end of this weekend, you'll have a real kind of plan and date on how that's going to play out.
[66:43.46]Alright, let's... Give me the ham.
[66:44.30]Let me test the ham.
[66:45.40]Oh.
[66:49.63]This is so much better.
[66:51.51]Having two missile launchers is a thousand times easier to take these things out.
[66:56.47]What a weird... This is a weird stream.
[66:58.35]I think this changes everything.
[67:28.68]How many bullets do I have?
[67:29.82]I have 50.
[67:30.38]It's alright.
[67:32.69]There's also a stomp.
[67:35.77]That's right, there is a stomp.
[67:37.49]Oh shit, I totally forgot about that.
[67:46.21]This room is quirky.
[67:58.99]You wouldn't classify me as a quirky streamer, right?
[68:07.80]What'd you guys say?
[68:08.64]A musician?
[68:09.26]What does that mean?
[68:25.51]You think I'm a quirky streamer?
[68:28.37]I don't think so.
[68:28.87]I think I'm more of an intelligent streamer.
[68:34.81]Like, when you turn the stream on, you know that you're going to get some really, really just smart things.
[68:41.58]Intelligent, smart, like, discussions.
[68:48.04]We're doing this down here?
[68:49.16]Okay.
[68:57.04]As I don't know now where to go.
[69:03.10]I was too good, I cleared it too quickly.
[69:04.72]It's down here around here.
[69:14.67]He says that as he plays the video game equivalent of smashing toys together and making explosions sound.
[69:32.41]That's the Metal Gear Solid Travel Through Time cigar lady sound.
[69:39.44]Slow that down.
[69:41.62]Stretch out the tempo a little.
[69:46.15]You got it.
[69:46.77]You got it.
[69:47.19]It's there.
[69:56.56]You know, I didn't... I wasn't sure about this game at first.
[69:59.65]But now that we've played it for about an hour or so, half hour... I could see how... I could play this for a little bit.
[70:04.93]I could see this.
[70:05.51]Let's try to get through the second level.
[70:08.35]That'd be great.
[70:20.85]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[70:25.48]This will explode, right?
[70:28.00]I was standing right there and I did it.
[70:31.58]You made it fail.
[70:33.74]You just saw me do it.
[70:38.48]Too slow?
[70:40.10]I was not too slow.
[70:41.19]That was perfect speed.
[70:52.09]No, I'm not gonna do it.
[70:54.19]I was gonna just say something just to say it.
[70:56.27]Just to say words.
[70:58.41]But I'm not gonna do it because it's like... It's like one of those video meme things that have just been like a thousand of them.
[71:08.98]I will tell you, the thing that I was gonna say just to like say is on the screen right now.
[71:14.48]Like the word is on the screen.
[71:18.86]And it's a meme that's been just done a million times.
[71:35.47]I'll give you another hint.
[71:36.75]The thing that this originates from, the original source material will probably be around in two to three hundred years.
[71:45.45]It'll be on season, like, 300.
[72:00.05]The building was opened two years ago on April 25th.
[72:04.67]It's named the Haocong Dengkai China Building.
[72:08.27]Each season it's decorated with lights.
[72:11.91]The Christmas tree tops it all.
[72:14.55]Over 800,000 people came to see it last December.
[72:17.61]For such a long time, I've been wondering how lovely that gorgeous building would look if it were destroyed.
[72:27.65]Judy, Judy, stop.
[72:30.15]I need ammo, otherwise this is not happening.
[72:41.43]How much ammo is in the other ham?
[72:51.02]Or it almost sounds like her lines have been pitch shifted a little bit and slowed.
[72:55.93]The tempo has been changed, not pitch shifted.
[72:57.81]You know when you listen to an audio recording that just sounds off?
[73:02.75]Even if it's pitched, the tempo changed by about 10%.
[73:07.94]A normal speaking voice just sounds normal because you hear me talking and your brain connects all the dots in between.
[73:13.00]Yeah, I have an accent, whatever, right.
[73:15.54]But the second that you slow down speech, it sounds really strange.
[73:22.31]You can hear every single mistake.
[73:25.75]Why is this not falling?
[73:29.11]So me going like this.
[73:30.41]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[73:32.43]Slow down tempo speed is like, hey, what's going on everybody?
[73:37.49]And it's just like, oh, you sound like shit.
[73:39.23]Is that actually how ugly your voice is?
[73:41.61]It's like, yeah, it is.
[73:50.82]He's drunk.
[73:52.84]Oh, fuck, I have to pay attention.
[73:54.04]Nobody talk.
[73:54.60]Oh.
[74:01.20]See?
[74:01.52]Can I not shoot?
[74:02.80]What is going on?
[74:04.34]What the fuck is happening?
[74:06.64]Oh, I didn't close it
[74:35.34]Get this off, too.
[74:36.20]What am I doing with this?
[74:39.50]Whoop!
[74:40.62]I only have three shots on this.
[74:57.29]Dude, something's fucking hitting me.
[75:00.27]And it's bad.
[75:01.66]Really fucking bad.
[75:02.80]And it's almost killing me every time.
[75:04.36]Is it the... Is it the missiles?
[75:26.84]Is he pretending?
[75:27.64]I'm not pretending.
[75:28.58]Why would I be pretending?
[75:33.17]I've done this, this is the third time I've done this.
[75:34.59]You think I'm gonna fucking pretend till I get hurt by this?
[75:39.15]This would be such a dogshit stream if I had to do this a third fucking time.
[75:49.67]Do you understand?
[75:51.35]Why would I want to do this a third time?
[75:55.48]Do I want to make your viewing experience horrible?
[76:01.14]I've got an idea.
[76:02.33]Let me do the fucking second tutorial mission.
[76:05.69]Six times.
[76:08.05]Maybe everyone will leave.
[76:12.55]Shut up.
[76:13.91]Dude, okay.
[76:14.89]Did you see what happened?
[76:26.19]What the fuck, man?
[76:27.51]What?
[76:32.67]You gotta be kidding me.
[76:36.11]This thing does so much damage.
[76:46.44]I'm getting hit by these stray rockets that come in and just kill you.
[76:50.90]They do almost the entire life bar.
[77:02.44]This is the Tails mission?
[77:03.84]What is that?
[77:04.72]I don't know what that even means.
[77:06.00]I think she's dead.
[77:27.39]Oh my god.
[77:28.35]OH MY GOD!
[77:32.46]This is unbelievable.
[77:33.48]Like what the fuck is this game?
[77:39.58]What?
[77:42.46]What?
[77:42.84]That was like stupid.
[77:53.97]Why is this game like this?
[77:59.22]Annihilate the enemy army by destroying the target areas where the troops have amassed.
[78:03.50]Destroy all the target areas scattered throughout and take back the town.
[78:09.34]I'm just, I don't even care about points.
[78:11.03]I'm getting out.
[78:19.81]Mr. President.
[78:21.01]Oh, shut up, Judy.
[78:22.53]Destroy the cage with light firearms and rescue the people.
[78:27.96]What the hell was that?
[78:29.04]That didn't make any sense.
[78:30.42]I'm like actually upset with this game.
[78:32.52]I'm going, just go, just go, go, go.
[78:53.80]Shoot the missiles?
[78:54.66]I was shooting the missiles.
[78:56.47]I was targeting with my... That's why I had the assault rifle up the whole time.
[79:01.35]If one of them touches you, it takes like 60% of your health.
[79:23.69]The dying joke.
[79:24.15]Yeah, why would I ever do this three times?
[79:52.60]shoot the missiles I WAS SHOOTING THE MISSILES I WAS DODGING THEM AND SHOOTING THEM JUST RUIN AND WATCH I WAS SHOOTING THE MISSILES JUST WATCH THE LAST ENCOUNTER
[80:12.46]I wasn't just letting them hit me going, what is that?
[80:16.06]What is that thing flying at me from across the screen?
[80:19.26]Those aren't missiles, are they?
[80:21.60]No, no, what are they?
[80:23.00]I think they're bugs.
[80:24.74]I'm getting hit in the face.
[80:26.40]What's hitting me here?
[80:29.24]Did I shoot those fucking things?
[80:33.32]Nah, nah, I'm just going to let them hit me.
[80:47.10]I'm saving my missiles.
[80:49.46]I'm saving my hand missiles.
[80:51.28]If I don't do this right now, I'm going to refund the game.
[81:43.53]High-powered weapons like bazooka.
[81:45.13]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.
[81:47.57]Please, don't hold back on using the weapons in your backpack.
[81:57.06]Do you have extra health?
[81:57.98]Why is it taking so long?
[82:10.29]Tank.
[82:12.31]I hate that fucking tank.
[82:14.33]I hate it.
[82:14.94]I'm just going.
[82:30.09]I don't even care.
[82:46.99]How many times does he stop, how many times does it take for him to stop pretending and play it normally?
[82:51.19]Well usually what happens is After about the fourth or fifth time of like LOL he's patting his screen, and he can't beat it Like we'd laugh about it, and I'm like what I can't do it.
[83:03.15]What happened?
[83:03.79]I can't beat the level and then everyone like laughs I probably like six or seven times I turn the facecam on and I go like what?
[83:16.38]You died in the tank!
[83:17.70]Oh ho ho!
[83:19.44]And everyone like laughs, like LOL, you died in the tank!
[83:21.98]He's like, he can't beat it!
[83:25.06]And I get like a fucking clown whistle, and I go like... And I look right into the fucking lens, and I go like this, I just go... Never mind, I can't even turn the camera on.
[83:38.73]Yeah, I die, I die.
[83:41.63]And then I go like this.
[83:45.90]You know what I mean?
[83:46.50]Like... What is that?
[83:48.46]That's my ceiling.
[83:55.34]Where is this camera?
[84:02.26]Why is it over here?
[84:11.02]You get it.
[84:11.38]You get the idea.
[84:12.24]I go like this.
[84:14.95]Oh, that's why.
[84:15.45]That's why it's fucked up.
[84:18.15]There's a big explosion and it fucking takes me out.
[84:21.09]Like, oh no, I can't believe it.
[84:22.21]I'll show you.
[84:22.59]I'll give you a couple of examples.
[84:23.65]We'll keep the facecam on for just a minute or two.
[84:25.97]Just so you understand.
[84:31.44]Right, so.
[84:35.14]I am going to keep the facecam on for this.
[84:37.32]Because that means I have to, like, I can't do any dumb facial features or anything.
[84:48.51]Put it on the bug camp.
[84:52.60]If I lose this fucking thing again, I swear to god.
[84:59.07]I gotta make sure my, like, lips aren't chapped.
[85:08.56]Am I out of ammo for this?
[85:12.82]I'm not doing this again, I swear to god, I promise.
[85:15.39]This game's fun, but I'm gonna get my acting up.
[85:20.58]My fly's down?
[85:21.40]Oh shit!
[85:23.32]Let me fix that!
[85:41.07]What are you doing?
[85:41.75]I almost died!
[85:45.52]Okay, I'm gonna do a... People are gonna come to the stream, they're gonna fucking hate this stream, but I'm gonna do a stream.
[85:50.64]Here comes the video.
[85:57.19]Yeah, people are going to hate this, but I'm flustered right now, so we're gonna do it.
[86:04.33]Here you go, you ready for this?
[86:11.37]I can't do this.
[86:16.59]I'm going to try.
[86:17.97]No, I'm not happy enough to do this.
[86:20.13]Let me get rid of this first.
[86:23.53]I'm going to make this quick.
[86:26.49]And then here comes the tank and I'm going to get it right.
[86:28.52]Turning the facecam on means I have to behave.
[86:31.80]Alright, here we go.
[86:42.27]I am ready.
[86:43.07]I've got my two launchers.
[86:51.47]I shouldn't even use this here.
[86:52.61]I should use it on the actual tank.
[86:53.85]That's the problem.
[86:56.37]Okay.
[86:56.69]Should I double?
[86:59.17]No, I can't double it up because I have to shoot the missiles.
[87:04.03]Right?
[87:04.43]Like, I shouldn't do this because then I have to shoot the missiles out of the air.
[87:14.32]I don't have anything to shoot the missiles out of the air.
[87:16.52]I just have to get... I have to just do good.
[87:18.00]I just have to dodge the missiles.
[87:19.46]I can't even do this.
[87:20.38]It's impossible.
[87:22.00]It's not possible for me to do this right now.
[87:24.07]Could this be a thank you for destroying the area?
[87:30.11]Use your shotgun.
[87:30.71]That fat boy needs a presidential diet.

[101:30.55]A sharp rebuke of cannon fire echoes across San Francisco to President Wilson, amidst his counter-offensive against the Vice President's regime.
[101:40.20]The liberation of the city struck a chord in the hearts of a small band of patriots whose alabaster souls still believed in the freedom that Richard Hawke had stripped away.
[101:47.90]A Moa movement had been born and it wanted Hawke to get the hell out of Dodge.
[101:52.12]The wings of justice were spreading, like an eagle.
[101:54.22]Here comes a...
[102:32.56]It's Thanos' really, really happy reverse brother.

[104:37.85]Last evening, the city of San Francisco suffered extensive damage at the hand of Metal Wolf, who suddenly appeared.
[104:48.26]In addition to slaughtering unresisting citizens, this heinous terrorist took citizens hostage and made an unjust demand for the release of violent criminals and the sum of 500 million dollars.
[105:08.86]This vicious act could easily be the worst in U.S.
[105:13.23]history.
[105:14.69]Metal Wolf's pilot is meaner than Satan himself.
[105:30.81]And we will not permit him to get away with acts like this.
[105:36.60]We Americans will never yield to such evil.
[105:43.16]We Americans will obtain our own justice.
[105:48.22]That's my line.
[105:49.76]Although martial law continues, my fellow Americans, please bear with our situation.
[105:59.53]To defend this lovable nation, let's lead the brave fight together.
[106:06.60]This has been an announcement from the government policy promotion department, where our motto, justice over theory, is your motto.

[107:19.13]Alright.

[139:40.52]There's two.
[139:41.04]I don't know why there are two.
[139:44.29]This is supposed to be Hearthstone.
[139:46.58]Let me just finish the game.
[139:49.78]Hearthstone.
[139:51.32]That's not Hearthstone.
[139:53.39]Oh my god.
[139:54.15]Alright, let me just win.
[140:11.88]I can do it still.

[141:45.60]I shouldn't have done so much damage in one turn.
[141:47.52]God damn it.
[141:51.04]It's true.
[141:51.38]You shouldn't have.
[141:58.19]I don't know.

[142:41.56]No.
[142:43.46]Railgun?

[143:39.22]Why wouldn't you just use the default one?
[143:44.30]Okay, I have new ones.
[143:45.40]No, I don't.
[143:50.62]Go back to Hearthstone.
[143:52.34]No, you don't want me to play Hearthstone.
[143:54.82]I can guarantee you do not want me to do that.
[143:57.34]Alright, MP7.

[144:57.34]I want this.
[144:57.92]I don't want the shotgun.
[145:05.04]It's alright, you can snooze if you want.
[145:06.66]Alright, here's the regular bazooka.
[145:14.58]We'll wake you up later, don't worry.
[145:17.16]I have to keep that there.

[152:12.40]I watched that stream yesterday and, like, I wasn't a fan.
[152:15.16]I just... I didn't know if you... Of course, it's a Dark Souls game.
[152:17.74]A gun battery that big should take five minutes to recharge.
[152:21.10]Until then, head for the Alcatraz cannon in the center of the island.
[152:26.35]Forget him and keep your mind on the mission, Mr. President.
[152:34.50]I know, come on.
[152:39.44]Yeah, I'm from all, like, I don't, is he a YouTuber or something, like a streamer?
[152:47.40]That's kind of fucked up, but he's streaming YouTube content, I know.
[152:57.26]Okay.
[153:01.95]I'm getting through this.
[153:02.61]More.
[153:02.75]More.
[153:02.96]Actually, can I put the assault rifle on here?
[153:06.10]I think I need it.
[153:07.02]No, of course you can't.
[153:07.96]What a blasted game, huh?
[153:29.08]The helicopters are the worst.
[153:29.98]They're the ones shooting the missiles.
[153:31.04]I have to get them done immediately.
[153:37.34]They are the worst.
[153:46.63]Don't fall off the edge like you did last time.
[153:49.89]It's not that hard.
[153:51.83]Get with it.
[153:56.43]There's two, right?
[154:00.23]It's the landmines.
[154:00.77]Watch out for them.
[154:01.29]Blow them up.
[154:01.63]I can blow them up, right?
[154:03.07]No?
[154:03.19]Okay.
[154:03.47]This is tricky here.
[154:14.52]This is tricky.
[154:15.12]Alright, let's get some bazookas on here.
[154:29.53]From distance.
[154:31.56]Pretty good.
[154:32.20]They can't even fire.
[154:34.06]That should be enough.
[154:35.76]Is that not enough?
[154:40.29]Got two Chang there.
[154:41.45]I'm sorry.
[154:42.11]My real voice is coming out.
[154:42.97]I'm from Boston, you fucking dude.
[154:50.80]the u.s military is being decimated platoon after platoon alright so that's it right be careful got it
[155:12.76]Where's that new weapon?
[155:13.98]Did I not equip it?
[155:15.40]I didn't even equip the damn thing.
[155:16.42]Are you serious?
[155:18.54]No, I did, didn't I?
[155:21.33]Oh, shit.
[155:23.17]Oh, shit.
[155:23.53]That's going to kill me.
[155:28.51]No, no.
[155:29.09]The stupid missiles.
[155:29.93]The airborne missiles.
[155:30.89]Okay.
[155:31.37]Hang on.
[155:32.11]Good.
[155:42.79]The Albatross cannon has been recharged 50% don't forget when the going gets tough the top get going Mr.. President.
[155:50.98]Yes Hurry hurry hurry And a wolf is taking aim at me Activate
[156:17.67]Whatever.
[156:28.69]Ah!
[156:31.64]Some scientists were among the POWs you rescued.
[156:33.98]They were probably used to make the Afotrav cannon.
[156:41.97]I got to hurry up.
[156:52.28]Yeah, I know I'm taking damage.
[156:53.34]Wait, that guy's stupid?
[156:54.30]70%.
[157:02.68]Come on!
[157:03.50]Come on, sir.
[157:05.18]Cannon?
[157:05.70]How do I get up there?
[157:06.96]How do I get up there?
[157:08.96]Down?
[157:26.39]Did I go all the way down at the beginning of the level?
[157:30.83]I did, didn't I?
[157:34.68]No, I didn't.
[157:41.78]Oh, come on.
[157:42.42]Are you serious?
[157:45.76]Where was the way to go?
[157:56.09]Wrap around this way.
[157:56.95]Can I still do it?
[157:58.52]Please don't make them.
[158:00.60]I think I can do it.
[158:04.16]Get the fuck out of here.
[158:09.25]Come on!
[158:11.29]Hey, get that on the news!
[158:26.30]Open the door!
[158:27.26]Open the door!
[158:27.96]Oh no!
[158:30.20]The final fortress has been demolished!
[158:33.42]So, the US military has had something up its sleeve.
[158:37.27]Those who interfere will be eliminated.
[158:43.97]95% it's already charged!
[158:46.59]This doesn't just shoot, right?
[158:48.09]The enemy tanks in the surrounding area are a key part to the Alcatraz cannon.
[158:52.09]Oh god, destroy all of them?
[158:55.81]I have to destroy all of them!
[158:58.09]All of them!
[158:58.57]It's at 97%!
[158:59.57]Mr. President, the Alcatraz cannon has been fully recharged!
[159:12.34]You won't make it in time!
[159:17.29]Ah, Metal Wolf, if you shoot, I'll hold it against you forever!
[159:23.01]Get us out of here!
[159:26.65]Oh, that sucks.
[159:34.93]Yeah, I just have to go.
[159:36.19]Forget about everything else.
[159:37.03]Just, we have to go fast now.
[159:38.21]Hurry.
[159:38.45]Oh my god.
[159:38.95]No, I want this.
[159:52.61]Hurry!
[160:16.88]A musician was among the POWs you rescued.
[160:19.80]He was forced to perform to entertain the troops.
[160:24.66]Oh shit, I'm split off.
[160:36.21]Oh fuck, I need, I need, I need, I need, I need this thing.
[160:42.77]The interception one.
[160:57.86]I didn't wanna fucking do that.
[160:59.94]I hit it accidentally.
[161:15.34]The defense strength is high against live ammunition.
[161:31.62]Come on.
[161:31.80]Double it up.
[161:32.38]Double it up.
[161:32.98]Double it up.
[161:33.48]Double it up.
[161:34.00]Double it up.
[161:38.98]What's hurting me that much?
[161:42.06]What's happening?
[161:43.16]The game is so broken.
[161:44.16]If you die really fast, it doesn't matter.
[161:45.70]The faster you die... If I'm going to die, I need to get hit by like a thousand damage points.
[162:04.54]Why is this taking so fucking long?
[162:07.61]I'm shooting the two rockets at the same goddamn time.
[162:11.37]40%.
[162:11.43]I'm not gonna do it.
[162:12.63]The U.S.
[162:13.41]military is being decimated.
[162:15.53]Something massive is blocking the road.
[162:18.28]Uh-oh, the armor looks tough as nails.
[162:20.96]Pound it with overwhelming firepower.
[162:35.82]I gotta use that.
[162:36.40]I need that thing to be charged now.
[162:48.45]Ugh.
[163:02.26]I know!
[163:02.90]It takes forever to kill everything!
[163:30.92]I'm in.
[163:36.12]I'm in.
[163:36.42]Let's go.
[163:36.74]Come on.
[163:37.04]I can destroy this shit over here, don't I?
[164:05.60]Shoot it!
[164:08.94]Okay.
[164:09.20]Go.
[164:09.34]Open the door!
[164:09.94]I have- that's the super thing.
[164:12.10]Open the door, please.
[164:13.70]Why does it take this long?
[164:15.74]How do I-
[164:39.99]Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
[164:44.23]Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.
[164:46.45]Ready?
[164:49.69]Justice! Rains from above!
[165:00.00]Oh fuck I forgot that game is like no longer relevant right now.
[165:13.41]It's not 2016.
[165:13.81]Shit.
[165:13.99]Come on, it's almost done.
[165:17.76]Got it!
[165:29.41]Before Metal Wolf could seize the area, under military orders, the soldiers blew up the Alcatraz cannon.
[165:36.46]Simply amazing.
[165:37.90]The U.S.
[165:38.66]military gets the job done no matter what.
[165:41.66]Today, once again, U.S.
[165:42.62]military forces were dealt a lethal blow by Metal Wolf.
[165:52.58]But thanks to these heroes in our military, Metal Wolf and his conspiracy have been held in check.
[165:58.06]Our hearts go out to the men and women who sacrificed their lives in battle.
[166:02.89]And to their families as well.
[166:04.63]Any further reporting is too dangerous.
[166:06.83]Our news team is seeking refuge.
[166:09.25]Be the first to know as we continue pursuing Metal Wolf.
[166:12.77]Because yes, the pen is still mightier than the sword.
[166:17.26]This has been Peter McDonald for DNN.
[166:20.86]Talk about biased reporting.
[166:22.88]It's exhausting to listen to.
[166:24.42]What the hell?
[166:25.20]But at least the West Coast is safe now.
[166:28.84]Yeah, that helicopter was a toy.
[166:30.00]Excellent work, Mr. President.
[166:32.41]It reminds me of old Star Wars movies when they used the real models, the real miniatures.
[166:36.09]A, E, D, D. I'll get a C. No, I won't.
[166:46.82]seventy thousand eighty thousand dollars I got some scientists alright brought peace to the west coast and gave the resistance into new momentum but Richard hawk's messaging continued to have a stronghold on the American people destroy metal wolf we cried along like hysterical brainwashed children and that ignorant chorus became the battle hymn of our oppressors in time we would be made painfully aware of just the line we were
[167:13.66]By the way Jody, what happened with yesterday's email?
[167:18.25]The information management department succeeded in contacting the source of the email.
[167:23.99]Really?
[167:24.71]Let me hear it.
[167:25.37]I am the one who formed the resistance to put a stop to Richard Hawk and his recklessness.
[167:31.72]Is this me talking?
[167:33.64]Right now I'm aiming for a united uprising and seek volunteers.
[167:37.84]What about those emails?
[167:39.92]Metal Wolf, we eagerly await your rampage.
[167:43.36]Great.
[167:43.93]They haven't sold out hope yet.
[167:47.99]Mr. President, I haven't been this happy since... Uh, my anniversary.
[167:54.51]My birthday.
[167:55.05]Uh, when I got the job.
[167:57.60]Uh, when I went down a really tall water slide.
[167:59.14]When I went down the roller coaster.
[168:00.36]Since that supermarket going out of business sale.
[168:03.44]When I was searching for my favorite candy and...
[168:08.09]And they had a... it was 60% off.
[168:13.25]And I got to buy like 10 boxes of it.
[168:16.27]And I ran into a celebrity and we had a conversation.
[168:20.21]Oh yeah, I know the feeling.
[168:37.45]Alright.
[168:39.91]Let's go to the Grand Canyon.
[168:43.09]Operating out of a massive helicopter base constructed in the Grand Canyon, enemy army helicopter units continue to oppress the American West.
[168:51.71]The target area terrain is sure to be confusingly fierce because the enemy army has taken over guerrilla bases from the Arizona insurrection days.
[169:00.80]Please watch your steps so you don't fall into the one mile deep ravine.
[169:03.98]I'm going to die here like three times.
[169:05.14]Use artillery with long range firing effectively and destroy all the target areas.
[169:10.45]Long range.
[169:10.99]This mission goes by the call name.
[169:14.21]Don't look down.
[169:17.95]Operation Arizona.
[169:19.65]Blood and gunpowder smoke.
[169:26.41]Next week.
[169:28.85]These are all next week on X-Anime.
[169:34.27]That also is a next week anime.
[169:39.46]Alright, let's do...
[170:01.23]I need range here.
[170:02.01]I'm going to do... I'm doing it.
[170:04.91]It's insanely expensive, but I'm going for it.
[170:08.45]The ML14 jaw.
[170:09.09]That's all I... I can't do anything else.
[170:12.13]Look at this thing.
[170:12.65]$46,000.
[170:12.67]1820 damage.
[170:18.44]That's pretty damn good.
[170:32.06]Lock on speed, F. They're all F. What's the range?
[170:37.25]B?
[170:37.49]That's not bad.
[170:43.35]I need speed.
[170:45.40]No, I need range.
[170:46.24]S. I'm going to get two of these.
[170:50.62]I want one in each hand.
[171:05.02]So, Ham Ham.
[171:08.62]What the hell are you doing?
[171:11.60]This range is terrible.
[171:12.52]So, I'm going to replace this with something that has better range.
[171:17.96]I'm not sure I have anything that has better range.
[171:19.33]I guess I do.
[171:19.83]Yeah.
[171:23.33]I want the Interceptor.
[171:25.21]That works really well.
[171:26.05]The range on this is absolutely terrible.
[171:27.85]I mean, I guess I just do...
[171:35.11]sniper just because I guess it's got range okay alright let's go begin the enemy is building a military base in the grand canyon
[172:03.89]doesn't this remind you of the Arizona insurrection days no I don't remember anything except the smell of blood and gun smoke no I don't know alright let's rock and roll so I need to arrange for this why
[172:29.77]I'd make one of those before we even started the level.
[172:33.54]That didn't take it out?
[172:37.32]I was gonna say, how?
[172:56.11]She just did a -2.
[172:57.37]Yeah, I know.
[172:58.49]That's what I'm saying.
[172:59.43]Knock it off the cliff.
[173:06.10]So it's under here?
[173:08.78]Underneath?
[173:09.10]I don't know.
[173:31.06]Come on, tap it.
[173:32.40]Ooh, that was actually pretty cool.
[173:38.26]That was cool.
[173:39.82]There's the target over there.
[173:44.40]Let's get double ham on this.
[173:51.65]It's not even ham, but I'll take it.
[173:54.93]Um.
[173:59.64]Can I fly over here?
[174:01.04]Oh shit, hold on.
[174:06.28]What the fuck is she doing?
[174:13.59]Get it.
[174:18.03]Come on, hit it.
[174:20.13]Ah.
[174:24.50]Okay, so now... I have to go across this.
[174:28.36]I can go over there though, right?
[174:31.98]I hope so.
[174:33.10]You gonna make it?
[174:36.12]Yeah.
[174:39.54]I need the M4.
[174:43.75]Some scientists were among the POWs you rescued.
[174:46.29]They were held in the mountains to maintain military helicopters.
[174:53.45]Go free!
[174:56.26]I need boost because I don't want to fuck this up.
[174:57.80]I want double ham.
[175:02.16]Oh!
[175:02.56]Okay.
[175:03.22]I was not holding down space.
[175:04.44]I should shift.
[175:05.44]I don't know.
[175:06.54]It's not worth dying for that.
[175:07.58]Let's get rid of the chopper.
[175:22.84]Scientists do maintain helicopters.
[175:24.90]Is that what you're saying?
[175:30.88]How is it only hitting one person?
[175:38.37]It's a tiny target area, huh?
[175:40.71]Almost like a bird's nest.
[175:42.17]Too bad you don't have any bird seeds.
[175:44.81]I guess you'll have to give them some delicious firepower instead.
[175:51.47]What a stupid way to say that.
[176:03.56]This interceptor is so good.
[176:04.82]How did I ever live without this?
[176:07.20]Mr. President, there's only one target area remaining.
[176:10.59]A little longer and this ravine will be back in its original state.
[176:20.73]Oh!
[176:20.99]Oh, they're dead, they're dead.
[176:22.13]It's okay.
[176:26.39]Double hand.
[176:26.77]Oh, you can just ride into him, too.
[176:41.99]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[176:42.93]Jeremy.
[176:44.19]Jeremy?
[176:48.45]No.
[176:49.01]Jeremy?
[177:00.43]Lock on.
[177:08.01]Go hard.
[177:09.21]Is somebody saying react harder?
[177:15.30]Go harder.
[177:15.88]Pee harder.
[177:16.44]The enemy is increasing with support troops from connecting areas.
[177:24.50]Please be careful.
[177:26.40]React more?
[177:30.03]That shit is so fucking ridiculous.
[177:33.50]I want more reactions.
[177:35.10]Get this whole thing done.
[177:49.92]Be louder.
[177:50.46]Talk louder.
[177:53.64]Nobody actually wants that.
[177:54.84]Uh oh.
[177:56.52]Boss?
[177:57.97]Mr. President, a fresh supply of troops is coming.
[178:02.88]So you're Metal Wolf, eh?
[178:04.82]Then you can die for Sir Richard.
[178:06.66]It's a helicopter.
[178:08.50]Sir Richard?
[178:09.30]What?
[178:10.18]Has he been knighted?
[178:12.98]Going up against jokers like this is so tiring.
[178:18.01]I'll have to ask you to leave this stage before you get hurt.
[178:21.25]I'm keeping out the interceptor.
[178:24.97]No doubt.
[178:28.02]Yeah, like, no.
[178:28.56]Are you kidding me?
[178:29.18]You gotta be shitting me.
[178:44.44]I'm gonna run into bullets with this fucking thing, aren't I?
[178:53.81]Oh!
[179:10.49]Hope he dies before that happens.
[179:13.61]There's more where that came from.
[179:17.91]I'll lay my tape.
[179:18.71]That was so easy.
[179:19.19]Oh my god.
[179:20.71]Sir Richard.
[179:24.61]I'm sorry.
[179:25.93]I wonder what anyone sees in the vice president.
[179:34.12]I didn't even have to play the game.
[179:35.30]Well, that was just a mini-blast, guys.
[179:37.96]That wasn't the real thing.
[179:43.05]Just a mini-blast.
[180:05.74]I only have rockets.
[180:07.04]Cool it down.
[180:08.24]There's still stuff over there that I gotta get across the way.
[180:12.89]Why did I miss this?
[180:37.67]Where is this thing?
[180:38.37]Is it here?
[180:42.69]Where is this?
[180:48.07]Where is that?
[180:50.57]It's underneath.
[180:51.61]Where is that?
[180:53.29]Oh, it's above!
[181:02.79]How do I get up there?
[181:08.62]Just shoot it?
[181:10.84]Just take out the bridge?
[181:13.86]How do I get up there?
[181:20.81]Did it work?
[181:40.19]chat is more entertaining with Jupiter than with me no not I guarantee it oh I guarantee it oh I am going
[182:09.28]what you get for having a funny chat yeah you guys are funny you guys are fun the game's not in what you'd like and you know just have fun just chill talk talk to each other communicate with each other I think it's been pretty fun it's fun enough to play down to the Colorado river
[182:38.01]Double ham.
[182:38.41]Double ham.
[182:38.89]Let's go.
[182:39.27]Stay behind the wall.
[182:40.41]That's an instant death if I get by this.
[182:56.82]That's a guaranteed.
[183:06.83]I'm getting to be communicating.
[183:26.39]Still alive?
[183:32.43]Come on!
[183:37.54]They're shooting them out of the air.
[183:57.21]It's good.
[184:04.25]Is Dremel short and bald for anybody else?
[184:06.45]Like, your TV's fucked up?
[184:07.89]Come on.
[184:08.97]Got it.
[184:24.85]No, I'm just not gonna put up with it anymore, you know?
[184:28.09]Why would I do that?
[184:30.59]I'm not gonna put up with it.
[184:32.36]I'm gonna fire back and say, hey!
[184:41.60]You can't get up that?
[184:46.06]How is that possible?
[184:48.44]Yeah, I'm just not going to stand for it anymore.
[184:55.35]Oh, okay.
[184:56.03]Yeah, I know.
[184:56.59]You're not going to stand because you have to stand to be able to see.
[185:13.83]I missed the old Jerma that played Hearthstone an hour ago.
[185:22.85]The enemy has been annihilated.
[185:41.85]Now turn it over to Relief.
[185:42.99]No more Hearthstone.
[185:43.81]What the hell are you talking about?
[186:16.06]S, B, C, D... A!
[186:21.42]First A.
[186:22.04]$200,000.
[186:22.06]Nice.
[186:29.49]Victory in the Grand Canyon proved to be significant.
[186:31.39]Without the enemy helicopter squadron to pin them down, the resistance fighters were able to continue their march.
[186:36.97]Peace had returned to Arizona, where folks came up with the saying, where there's a Wilson, there's a way.
[186:41.49]The man they had mocked as a rebel army major had elevated himself to presidential standing again, and people were starting to believe this man had a chance.
[186:48.50]DNN correspondent Peter McDonald.
[186:50.88]Any word from the resistance?
[186:54.46]Yes, I'll play it for you now.
[186:59.00]Metal Wolf, we applaud and appreciate your efforts.
[187:03.75]Get the multi missiles.
[187:05.99]You got it.
[187:07.23]You got it.
[187:09.95]I'm putting all my efforts into our activities, hoping that the day we revolt will come soon.
[187:14.98]I'd like to see that day too.
[187:22.52]Yeah.
[187:26.12]I feel like a mother hen.
[187:27.58]Okay, Mr. President.
[187:28.76]You best hurry and get to the next battle theater.
[187:32.62]Battle theater?
[187:33.52]Alright, Phoenix.
[187:37.26]What's over here?
[187:38.40]Oh, right.
[187:38.82]I did that.
[187:39.22]Alright, let's do Phoenix.
[187:42.16]The enemy force is apparently carrying out covert military campaigns based in a ghost town in the Phoenix suburbs.
[187:49.03]I feel like a mother hen.
[187:51.25]I feel like a mother hen.
[187:52.25]This is the voice.
[187:55.57]I could have done a much better job.
[187:56.77]I feel like a mother hen.
[188:01.07]I feel like a mother hen.
[188:02.60]No, that's not good.
[188:11.12]My darling Clementine Operation.
[188:13.38]I liked it.
[188:14.99]I thought it was good, too.
[188:16.27]Good luck, and Godspeed, Mr. President.
[188:22.90]Alright, you want me to develop some multi-missiles?
[188:28.70]Let's take a look.
[188:31.32]Multi-missile launcher, that's expensive to start.
[188:35.74]MML-8.
[188:36.04]Let's do it again.
[188:40.38]Again.
[188:44.20]MMLA QLS.
[188:46.31]Do it again.
[188:47.77]No, I want some money left over.
[188:49.79]MMLA QLS.
[188:53.89]The people of Skoven, what are you talking about?
[188:57.03]Check this poll.
[188:57.71]What poll?
[188:59.25]Check the poll.
[188:59.73]What do you mean the poll?
[189:01.23]What are you guys trying to say?
[189:04.83]What are you saying?
[189:09.59]Poll, poll, poll.
[189:14.35]I'm not going back to play that.
[189:16.41]What do you mean, should I go back and play?
[189:17.95]No, we don't go back.
[189:19.62]We go forward.
[189:29.07]No, we already had a chance with that game.
[189:31.71]And it's over.
[189:33.37]We go forward.
[189:42.63]Go back and play the acid game.
[189:45.99]No way.
[189:49.29]No, you guys got to sleep in this bed.
[189:53.53]I was told, get out of this.
[189:56.19]I don't like this.
[189:58.52]Next, next, next.
[190:07.64]We didn't ask for this.
[190:08.50]Oh, yes, you did.
[190:10.12]I did a poll before the stream started and it was like 80% of people said they'd play this one!
[190:15.74]I was told to play this one, this was something they said and they told me at the beginning of the stream!
[190:18.88]Alright, uh, let me look and see what these do.
[190:23.93]Look, you guys just like, talk to each other, communicate with each other!
[190:26.23]Reduce lock, basic, basic multi missile launcher buys 8 projectiles.
[190:33.11]Basic multi missile launcher would reduce lock on time.
[190:36.49]So this is better.
[190:37.90]Is there another one?
[190:38.46]Why is it level 3?
[190:44.70]I'll give it a try.
[190:45.18]I'm going to get two of them.
[190:51.30]I also wanted to do... Uh, what did I want to do?
[190:55.82]There was a couple of these that I wanted, right?
[190:59.24]No, no, no.
[190:59.54]This one here.
[191:00.12]The SG.
[191:01.06]This one.
[191:02.90]It's expensive.
[191:04.69]It's good, though.
[191:09.01]Bazookas.
[191:09.55]I didn't need... I had another one of these, too.
[191:14.33]Boo.
[191:15.65]Range B, starting capacity.
[191:18.09]High explosive rockets.
[191:19.21]I'll try this one.
[191:25.75]You guys just talk to each other, you know?
[191:31.95]I can't get this one.
[191:33.31]Sorry.
[191:37.03]LaCranda, thanks for the $50.
[191:37.93]5,000 bits from LaCranda.
[191:43.00]Thank you so much for the huge amount of money.
[191:44.42]And they say, do something funny like the acid game.
[191:51.55]I'm not playing that game.
[191:52.89]I can guarantee it.
[191:59.87]Oh, it is two.
[192:01.85]I'm not playing that game.
[192:09.29]That double hand is still fine.
[192:11.11]I don't want this anymore, though.
[192:13.89]Did I get the flamethrower?
[192:14.75]No, I need the, uh, the interceptor.
[192:19.95]Interceptor and... I mean, are you a furry?
[192:28.32]I... No.
[192:29.52]That's... I don't care.
[192:31.80]Alright.
[192:33.84]I'm ready.
[192:34.88]Save the game.
[192:36.66]Stream's not boppin' anymore.
[192:39.88]Yes, it is.
[192:41.34]The stream is boppin' right now.
[192:46.07]Look, let me play my game that I want to play.
[192:49.08]I want to play this fun game.
[192:51.56]You're becoming unruly.
[192:53.66]And we're in the Wild West.
[192:54.56]This place is pretty run down.
[192:57.08]Like a town in an old western.
[192:58.98]A radar jamming station is located here.
[193:04.42]The number of target areas and enemies seem limited.
[193:07.40]If you have to say something bopping, that means it's not bopping.
[193:09.66]Let's mop this area up ASAP.
[193:10.94]I know, that's true.
[193:12.62]That's like you throw a party, you hire like a DJ, and you have a big space, you rent out like a club for a night.
[193:19.34]And the DJ's playing, just spinning records, sounds awesome.
[193:24.39]It's you, your best friend, and like one or two other people that actually accepted and went to the Facebook invite.
[193:30.59]There's nobody else there.
[193:31.51]And you're like walking around like, this is pretty sick, huh?
[193:34.39]This is Bobbin.
[193:35.91]You've tarnished the good name of the U.S.
[193:38.03]military and your reputation as a hero.
[193:41.53]And now you'll die for it.
[193:50.70]Whatever.
[193:51.30]Am I going to play this for the rest of the night?
[193:54.26]I don't know.
[193:55.56]Once I get done with it or bored with it, maybe we'll do something else.
[193:58.88]Maybe we'll do something more.
[193:59.89]I don't know.
[194:00.43]Want to find out who gets to play Wyatt Earp?
[194:07.23]Here we go, we got Paul, Randy, and Shaq.
[194:20.13]I don't even know who they are.
[194:21.45]Hold on, I heard Paul.
[194:22.71]Hey, what's up?
[194:24.55]I'm out of missiles.
[194:25.63]How is that possible?
[194:39.91]Where is this guy?
[194:42.01]Stop, for God's sake, stop!
[195:07.39]He doesn't know when he's going to play this for another four hours.
[195:12.40]I don't think I'm even going to scream for another four hours.
[195:16.82]Hey, sir, you're corrupt.
[195:18.62]Everybody needs to relax.
[195:20.68]You always told me there's no victory for a man who loses his pride.
[195:26.39]Have you had enough?
[195:28.91]How about I put you out of your misery now?
[195:33.21]Right now, I may as well be loaded into a TV show.
[195:36.17]I'm just watching it on my screen over on the right.
[195:40.00]It's like a radio show.
[195:40.82]This is like a daytime drama.
[195:41.60]...for that kind of headache is pumping it full of a heavy dose of lead.
[195:59.74]The thing is, though, all the people that are saying, hey, dude, this game, like, sucks.
[196:04.14]I don't think they know.
[196:05.76]This is FromSoftware.
[196:07.56]Now, that's it.
[196:09.74]No, I meant, oh, I meant to say, oh, fuck.
[196:12.28]No, I have to like every one of those.
[196:14.12]Um, uh, it's, it's alright.
[196:16.02]I like it, I think.
[196:16.74]That should stop their special mobile army unit stealth capabilities.
[196:29.08]Dude, who made this fucking shitty game?
[196:30.86]This game sucks!
[196:32.30]Sucks!
[196:32.62]This game's fucking stupid!
[196:35.06]FromSoftware, mate.
[196:38.15]What I meant to say was... It's not my thing.
[196:42.93]It's not my kind of game, I don't think.
[196:46.45]No, I'm right in front of you, dude.
[196:49.57]Oh my god, I'm gonna lose.
[197:03.62]What's wrong with me?
[197:06.76]You know, maybe it's not for me.
[197:17.61]You know I love you guys, come on.
[197:19.39]Why can I not move?
[197:28.23]Mr. President.
[197:28.81]I don't even know where they are.
[197:30.11]My mini-map is jammed.
[197:31.34]Oh, that's what's happening.
[197:32.80]I can't...
[197:47.02]I'm going to go around and just play.
[197:49.50]I probably should just go and kill the one of them.
[197:52.40]Grab a wraparound and find one.
[197:55.62]Hey, this thing isn't invisible.
[197:58.49]The one that's not is invisible.
[198:09.85]Where the hell is it?
[198:28.72]Do I have to destroy targets or something before I can?
[198:30.98]Probably like, yeah, this thing.
[198:33.36]That makes sense.
[198:35.70]That's a radar jamming installation.
[198:37.60]The best medicine for that kind of headache is pumping it full of a heavy dose of lead.
[198:43.17]Now the stealth system of the enemy's special mobile armor is knocked out.
[198:47.47]Now that's refreshing.
[198:49.59]Kind of like sunrise on an early summer morning.
[199:00.93]Some scientists were among the POWs you rescued.
[199:04.10]They were probably used to develop new type mobile unit armor.
[199:13.20]Like, I don't come, I don't, look, look, if you come in the light, never mind.
[199:18.22]As I say, imagine you're playing a game, having a fun time, and your brother comes in, your friend comes in, you're sitting there, like, hey, what are you playing?
[199:30.71]Oh, I'm playing Metal Wolf Chaos.
[199:35.55]Oh, cool.
[199:37.33]This game's stupid.
[199:39.49]Okay.
[199:41.45]I think it's alright.
[199:42.51]I think it's kind of fun to run around, just kind of walk on.
[199:44.79]No, this game's bad.
[199:46.39]This game's stupid.
[199:50.53]Yeah, alright, man.
[199:52.67]You wanna go home?
[199:53.71]Or you wanna stay?
[199:54.83]No, no, I'm gonna stay.
[199:56.99]Oh, okay.
[199:59.49]You wanna go get food or something?
[200:02.36]No, I'm gonna sit here and tell you every five minutes that I hate this game and I don't like it.
[200:10.78]Why are you here?
[200:12.20]Why are you doing this to me?
[200:13.84]What did I do?
[200:16.50]Are you upset with me?
[200:17.44]No, no, not at all.
[200:20.25]I think our friendship is very, very good.
[200:22.30]No, I think that too.
[200:38.01]Oh, and by the way.
[200:39.05]No, no.
[200:39.67]By the way, dude.
[200:40.23]Not only do I not like this.
[200:41.39]You're doing it wrong.
[200:46.15]Am I?
[200:46.49]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[200:47.89]This game sucks and you're doing it wrong.
[200:50.38]I thought you didn't like this game!
[200:51.52]No, I don't, but you're doing it wrong.
[200:52.68]And you're stupid and you're bad.
[200:55.10]I- oh!
[200:58.47]Oh my god!
[201:00.19]Oh no!
[201:05.05]And yeah, dude, by the way, I'm like back here right now, kind of sitting behind you.
[201:07.93]You're bald as fuck!
[201:09.89]Okay!
[201:10.61]Oh, are you sure we're friends?
[201:24.58]You're really bald today.
[201:25.84]I would like to call my mother and be like, Mom, can you come in here and tell him to go home?
[201:36.97]That's so fucking funny.
[201:40.13]Alright, let's see if I can get two here.
[201:42.07]Get your PogChamps ready!
[201:54.39]Dude, I don't know if it's just these, dude, but there's, like, a smell in this room.
[201:58.35]Is that you?
[201:58.81]Is that your body?
[201:59.39]Your body smells.
[202:00.15]I've been sitting here for a while, dude.
[202:03.41]Maybe I am, like, kind of... I don't know.
[202:12.78]Okay, now that one I could forget, because, like, if you, like, smell bad, like, you don't... Okay, never mind.
[202:17.02]That one's fine.
[202:20.06]Alright, let's go with the real deal here.
[202:28.83]Diaper check!
[202:29.83]Diaper check!
[202:56.83]Hey, man, like, yeah, you having a good time?
[202:58.59]Hanging over at my house?
[203:00.05]Yeah, yeah, I'm having a good time.
[203:02.59]The game's not that bad.
[203:03.87]Whatever, I just like hanging out with you.
[203:06.27]I like, yeah, I just like kind of hanging out with you, too.
[203:08.17]Yeah, it doesn't matter what you're doing.
[203:10.57]You can be playing something, you can be eating something, hanging out.
[203:14.15]I like when you're here, too.
[203:15.91]Oh, by the way, show me your diaper.
[203:18.93]Can I diaper check?
[203:21.39]No.
[203:25.08]What are you talking about?
[203:28.20]This is not fair, though, because this would be... This is not fair, because I did, like, shake around and pretend I had a diaper on.
[203:37.18]So, like, if I... If I was... If my friend was over and I, like, shook around and pretended I had a diaper on, and then later on he was like, Dude, diaper Jack, come on.
[203:44.92]Like, what the fuck's going on here?
[203:47.84]And, okay, yeah, that makes sense.
[203:48.72]Okay.
[203:58.52]Oh, how stupid!
[204:00.56]He's just talking to himself.
[204:01.93]It's his fault.
[204:03.47]Randy?
[204:04.43]Damn it.
[204:05.75]It ain't over till it's over.
[204:15.16]I'm just like, manically talking to myself.
[204:21.41]What the fuck is wrong with me?
[204:34.28]All enemy special mobile armor units have been put six feet under, town marshal.
[204:41.15]How's it feel to be an Old West hero?
[204:43.97]I want to hear the claps, please.
[204:46.53]Not too good.
[204:48.31]I'm not the hero type.
[204:52.37]I'm just doing my job as president.
[205:07.67]I'm good on the KOs.
[205:09.09]Not much else.
[205:23.34]the precariously positioned Arizona resistance base had come under heavy fire from a two three trio of ultra mobile to armored suits but when the dust settled the fires the resistance still burning
[205:34.73]However, let us never forget the noble souls who perished under the name, under the sun in President Wilson's name.
[205:40.05]But as we all know, the government has since built a road that stretches as far from the desert of Phoenix all the way to the east coast, the Michael Wilson Highway.
[205:48.34]Straight as an arrow, it serves as a reminder to keep our country on the path of righteousness and never become lost again.
[205:55.66]Jody, what's the situation on the ground across America?
[205:59.98]In the west, areas where the army is pulling out are on the rise.
[206:06.49]I'll do this one more.
[206:07.13]And then I'll move on to tier lists or something.
[206:28.90]Maybe like two more.
[206:29.86]I'm gonna do a few more.
[206:30.72]Anything but tier lists.
[206:31.44]I plan on playing this for like another 30 minutes.
[206:54.90]I was gonna stop after about 30-40 more minutes, so that sounds fine.
[207:08.24]I think I'm gonna get a major boss fight here, that's why I wanna wait.
[207:11.84]I wanna do it tomorrow.
[207:14.38]While the number of soldiers equipped with heavy firearms is great, if you pay higher attention to their attacks, they're no threat to your mobile armor.
[207:24.76]the verticals in this battle theater are violent consider the advantages and disadvantages and the geographical features as you destroy all the target areas in the town spend an hour in a hearthstone joke 30 minutes actually this mission goes by the call name brings fashion back to the streets good luck and god it's a weird name for a level alright
[207:53.09]invest in... probably... another... a better assault rifle.
[207:59.40]I like the assault rifles.
[208:01.56]The SB.
[208:04.02]And... missile launchers?
[208:07.12]I can't... I'm not gonna be able to afford it.
[208:13.48]Mmm... What should I do?
[208:21.55]Probably save the money.
[208:27.31]Alright, if I buy this, I won't be able to afford the new, uh... No, go back to develop.
[208:32.19]Let me see.
[208:39.78]Should I just do two of these assault rifles?
[208:44.18]They're five STUN rounds.
[208:46.76]That doesn't sound very good.
[208:47.84]STUN rounds?
[208:48.46]What's that good against?
[208:49.14]80 damage?
[208:51.40]200 capacity?
[208:52.15]This thing's terrible.
[208:52.97]What does it do?
[208:53.53]Should I even buy one of these?
[208:55.67]That's a lot of money.
[209:02.44]Non-lethal?
[209:03.60]Does non-lethal mean anything?
[209:07.10]Doesn't sound like I want that.
[209:13.51]What is this FIFA 08 music?
[209:24.84]I don't know.
[209:25.50]You tell me.
[209:30.99]You guys, I can't even.
[209:33.94]I can't even right now.
[209:35.54]You guys are too much.
[209:37.70]You guys are too much for me to handle right now.
[209:42.27]I like this.
[209:42.75]Alright, get it together.
[209:47.11]I'm fine.
[209:47.99]I want the big one.
[209:55.07]You always want at least, you want two different types in each hand.
[209:58.01]That's fine, double ham.
[210:00.07]But I am going to replace this with a different missile launcher here.
[210:03.55]Yeah, this one here.
[210:07.43]That one's fine.
[210:09.59]Alright.
[210:10.61]Looks good.
[210:12.83]Let's go.
[210:14.13]Boss time.
[210:19.36]Enemy explosive devices are planted all over the city of Beverly Hills.
[210:24.27]Destroy all the bombs and liberate the town.
[210:27.15]Can you tell that Kim shits the bed story again?
[210:31.65]Uh, no.
[210:32.47]Just go rewind like an hour and a half.
[210:35.96]This is DNN's Peter McDonald reporting.
[210:39.28]What you're looking at is the heinous terrorist Metawolf as seen from the air.
[210:44.66]Just what will become of Beverly Hills and its stately mansions with a street smell of money?
[210:51.05]Stay tuned as this camera and I bring you all the news you want to know.
[210:55.83]Not him again.
[210:59.85]Embed that journalist in the ground.
[211:03.82]Forget him and keep your mind on the mission, Mr. President.
[211:08.06]This is a reverse meltdown.
[211:09.46]Bombs have been laid out all over town.
[211:11.82]Reverse meltdown is like, I can't handle it right now.
[211:16.13]Alright.
[211:17.89]Let's try this missile.
[211:20.89]I like it.
[211:21.51]That's a lot of damage.
[211:23.99]Takes a long time to reload.
[211:26.75]Let's go.
[211:27.13]What about this thing?
[211:28.69]If you destroy it, the bombs will surely show up on radar.
[211:31.87]A lot of people.
[211:39.30]This is a good combo.
[211:44.85]I like this one.
[211:45.71]That's good damage.
[211:46.57]I'm going to keep my eye out for other shit.
[211:48.67]Oh, ammo.
[211:49.23]That was Norton.
[212:09.09]It could be.
[212:10.43]Safe distance.
[212:11.31]Where is it?
[212:27.71]Some scientists were among the POWs you rescued.
[212:30.84]They were used to develop new weapons for the military.
[212:34.52]Ah, this looks promising.
[212:35.44]The pride of the US military.
[212:36.70]Blackhawks raise their ugly heads.
[212:59.08]Are they shooting?
[212:59.68]Let's go.
[213:00.38]Hurry up.
[213:01.20]Get out of here.
[213:14.82]It's a bomb?
[213:16.44]It's driving into me.
[213:17.50]What are you talking about?
[213:18.64]How was I supposed to know that was going to happen?
[213:29.31]Get in closer.
[213:30.05]Come on, get in there.
[213:33.86]Mr. President, the fuselage damage rate is above 50%.
[213:38.38]Mr. President, I sense that you are preoccupied and your force is not in it today.
[213:45.19]How do you like me now?
[213:51.23]Now, not again.
[213:52.75]A battalion of troops has been defeated.
[213:55.31]Oh, put a sock in it.
[213:58.99]Don't get too close.
[214:00.39]A musician was among the POWs you rescued.
[214:03.43]I wonder if the Vice President wants to go as far as to control the music in America.
[214:07.66]Control the music.
[214:09.36]Now that would be odd.
[214:12.58]How many bombs are there?
[214:21.01]Two more?
[214:23.95]Three more?
[214:24.19]Oh dear.
[214:27.41]The defense strength is high against live ammunition.
[214:30.67]Can I get it?
[214:33.47]Yeah!
[214:34.53]Off it on, good.
[214:43.03]Nice work, Jeremy.
[214:44.73]Good work, dude.
[214:45.87]Oh, but I already pulled stuff in that thing.
[214:55.62]Oops.
[214:55.76]Is it gonna explode?
[214:59.71]Nice work, President Jerda.
[215:13.78]Can I shoot through that?
[215:15.64]I couldn't have done that if I tried.
[215:17.62]I did it again.
[215:18.76]How is that possible?
[215:26.12]What is going on?
[215:29.88]What the fuck is happening?
[215:31.80]Go!
[215:35.30]I don't know why it's doing that.
[215:43.71]There's the bomb, I get it.
[215:53.37]There's the bomb?
[216:04.04]Got it.
[216:05.90]How many more?
[216:08.29]I don't think there's many more.
[216:10.87]Ooh, I got some M4.
[216:12.15]Is that enough ammo?
[216:12.73]No, it's not an SG.
[216:14.55]Let's switch to the ammo.
[216:18.79]Sounds good.
[216:19.59]If you destroy the enemy
[216:34.50]Ooh, check this one out.
[216:35.82]Bingo.
[216:36.52]That felt good.
[216:44.09]Come on.
[216:51.97]YouTuber and streamer 101.
[216:54.66]Looking for something to do or say where you don't have anything to say at all?
[216:58.26]And you're just playing a game?
[217:00.62]Use short, quick adjectives.
[217:03.36]like you got it bingo take on that one nice huge smoke
[217:33.86]Whatever they are, add them.
[217:40.95]Cute.
[217:42.81]See?
[218:04.33]Listen to her.
[218:05.71]Don't listen to my yammering commentary.
[218:07.84]Just listen to my one line that I say every three minutes.
[218:13.06]Alright, is that not it?
[218:17.06]There's more shit to do.
[218:23.93]What other bombs did I not destroy?
[218:37.23]Um... M?
[218:42.16]Oh, damn.
[218:42.66]Okay, I gotta go this way.
[218:52.55]Got it.
[218:52.99]Boom.
[218:54.61]Shit.
[218:55.25]I'm gonna be thinking about that now.
[218:57.76]Got it.
[218:58.18]Boom.
[218:59.18]Fuck.
[219:06.59]It's that I'm concentrating and like I have nothing to say because I'm concentrating.
[219:10.47]The home of international superstar Money Money Gold.
[219:14.53]What business does Metal Wolf have with a 3.2 billion dollar man?
[219:19.33]Maybe he's going to take out a loan.
[219:21.39]Oh man, he's destroying the mansion.
[219:24.29]Add destruction of personal property to the breaking and entering charges.
[219:28.03]The US Constitution is downright powerless against Metal Wolf's evil.
[219:36.48]That's so stupid.
[219:49.68]Get that radar going, please.
[219:57.87]It's messing up my game.
[220:04.47]bomb watch it detonate why did that not happen what planet are you from wait those oops it's okay
[220:35.91]I thought it was a bomb.
[220:37.25]I thought it was a bomb.
[220:40.22]Maybe it was, but I messed up.
[220:44.24]Sometimes you mess up too.
[220:49.39]Metal Wolf has control of the entire town.
[220:53.25]Any further reporting is too dangerous.
[220:55.55]Our news team is seeking refuge.
[220:57.95]But our coverage of these events will continue.
[221:01.31]Because, yes, the pen is still mightier than the sword.
[221:05.09]I hate this thing.
[221:05.69]Get this fucking like Paw Patrol looking thing the fuck out of here.
[221:09.49]It's annoying me now.
[221:13.41]I'm sure those wealthy fad cats will repair the damage, making their homes even more beautiful than before.
[221:21.00]Nice work, Mr. President.
[221:28.70]That one was pretty good.
[221:29.92]It was alright.
[221:33.43]I did that pretty cleanly.
[221:36.13]Yeah.
[221:38.65]I'm only studying for one test.
[221:40.17]Alright, so now that should open up.
[221:43.54]I've done all the ones that are on the map.
[221:45.24]I think we're gonna get our first major boss storyline boss.
[221:50.51]President Wilson had taken the West by storm, with no legs left to stand on Hawke's coup d'etat.
[221:54.39]Forces had no choice but to go on the retreat.
[221:56.99]The resistance was gaining steam, and all at once, cities across America were getting ready.
[222:00.73]Thanks to Michael Wilson's huffing and puffing, the winds of freedom were blowing again and stronger than ever.
[222:06.17]However, Richard Hawke had a black heart and unwavering ambition.
[222:10.68]Soon the course of history would do yet another about-face.
[222:15.26]Jody, what's the situation across America?
[222:18.93]The coup d'etat forces have retreated from the western states.
[222:23.20]Yes.
[222:24.52]This should kick the resistance movement into high gear.
[222:28.28]I can't wait.
[222:29.90]You got a voicemail from the resistance, Mr. President.
[222:32.08]He's so excited over this.
[222:33.82]Metal Wolf, thanks to your efforts, the stage is set for a united revolt in the west.
[222:40.30]I'm considering moving ahead.
[222:42.72]However, before this takes place, I'd like to meet you in person to talk.
[222:47.30]Don't meet in person.
[222:48.54]Yeah, I know we will.
[222:49.20]We'll try.
[223:17.92]Uh-oh.
[223:20.18]Metal Wolf.
[223:21.38]Planning on wiping out New York this time?
[223:23.90]You enemy of the people.
[223:25.18]I, Richard Hawk, won't let you get away with it.
[223:28.79]Me, Richard Hawk.
[223:30.09]I, Richard Hawk.
[223:31.93]Me.
[223:33.49]Will uphold American justice without fail.
[223:39.60]You puny.
[223:40.90]Me strong.
[223:42.16]Yeah.
[223:43.88]Suck on my missile punch.
[223:56.92]We kind of just skipped right to the end here, huh?
[224:03.15]The best thing about localized...
[224:20.85]So there's a ton of sound effects going on right now that we don't hear because they dropped the audio track from the original, put on music, and then just talk over it with like a truck driving sound in the background.
[224:33.01]There's a bunch of cool sound effects here that we're not hearing.
[224:38.04]This is the original.
[224:42.06]This is the original?
[224:49.56]Long live the USA!
[224:50.98]Oh, shit.
[224:52.82]Alright.
[224:54.52]I guess it's the original.
[224:58.34]Dear fellow Americans, good evening.
[225:01.96]This is an announcement from the government policy promotion department where freedom in the United States wasn't built in a day.
[225:11.14]Good news, finally.
[225:14.24]Finally, the evil has been crushed.
[225:18.02]this evening finally metal wolf who suddenly showed up in New York was thoroughly beaten to a pulp by Richard hawk piloting a special heavy mobile armor unit he annihilated the evil occurring at the same time from a confidential covert operation
[225:41.82]We have also learned that underground terrorists and Meadow Wolf sympathizers in hiding were captured in succession all around the country.
[225:54.54]Although martial law will continue until we are sure that your safety can be completely secured.
[226:01.45]For today and today only, let's celebrate this victory.
[226:08.44]This has been an announcement from the Government Policy Promotion Department.
[226:12.16]Your Freedom Hunt Man.
[226:18.63]M-Metal Wolf crushed?
[226:21.33]Wasn't even me.
[226:21.91]I already know.
[226:22.63]I can see this.
[226:23.01]I already know what happened.
[226:24.59]They put a guy in a suit, just like an actor, and just pretended to beat him up.
[226:28.87]And those phony visuals.
[226:30.65]Mm-hmm.
[226:31.13]That's right.
[226:31.97]What's with that?
[226:33.43]The special effects don't even beat a Hollywood B-movie.
[226:37.68]Richard's up to his old tricks again.
[226:41.38]Mr. President, according to the Special Intelligence Group, news from the anti-Kudeta forces has ceased.
[226:50.69]Actually, we've lost contact with the Resistance leader, too.
[226:55.49]We have?
[226:58.16]It appears all the Resistance activities have gone south.
[227:02.68]jody those that died are imposters I am still here so believe in your own justice does she not think that she was talking to me I won't lose to that false prophet and the reason is because I'm the president of the United States of America Mr. president there's no time for self-pity jody get me up to speed on the situation in the east
[227:32.73]oh my god that's fucking ridiculous
[227:57.80]Let's go Is this New York?
[227:58.58]Houston, Chicago.
[227:59.08]Let's check out Chicago
[228:22.11]The enemy force has concentrated strength in the center of Chicago.
[228:26.12]Intelligence's most educated guess is that the purpose is to re-educate the citizens and strengthen their support for the Vice President.
[228:34.20]Though there are many target areas, it is possible to annihilate the enemy by effectively using the train to move from building to building.
[228:41.73]Jump on the train.
[228:42.51]Destroy the target areas and let the citizens wake up to their town with its tranquility.
[228:47.81]This mission goes by the call name...
[228:54.42]Not for much longer.
[228:54.96]This is probably the last mission.
[228:57.08]I wanted to do at least the whole West Coast.
[228:59.32]Because I was thinking maybe we'd see, like, somewhere other than Phoenix, you know, maybe we'd get some, like, Nevada somewhere.
[229:05.76]I don't know.
[229:10.40]Like, Area 51 or something, right?
[229:11.97]I'm sure that would be, like, make sense in this game.
[229:13.89]It's alright.
[229:19.35]I do want to do, like, one more, though.
[229:26.64]I want the best of the best.
[229:30.25]Which is not going to happen, but... I want another tier of assault rifle.
[229:39.65]SG-552LR.
[229:40.59]I want another one.
[229:45.21]There it is.
[229:45.61]I got level 6 assault rifles.
[229:51.00]Let's check that out.
[229:56.86]Let's see.
[229:57.82]SG-52SB.
[229:59.16]That's the stun one.
[230:00.86]An advanced assault rifle with outstanding range.
[230:03.12]175 versus 170.
[230:05.02]Pretty good.
[230:08.32]Then there's energy rounds.
[230:10.63]That's pretty good.
[230:11.27]1800 capacity.
[230:14.33]Here's the big one.
[230:15.69]A supreme assault rifle with incredible range and firepower.
[230:19.15]I don't quite have enough to buy this, but I'm going to get the energy one.
[230:27.30]Alright, so I'm going to do one more after this.
[230:29.32]One more after this!
[230:32.54]There is a Vegas level.
[230:33.48]It's later on in the game.
[230:35.66]Oh.
[230:37.00]Well, we'll see how far we get.
[230:43.96]So two more.
[230:44.52]So three more.
[230:45.05]So four more.
[230:47.03]I'm actually going to keep that on.
[230:48.99]But we're going to remove this and put on that new stuff.
[230:58.22]This one right here.
[230:59.82]Yeah.
[231:01.86]And... Yeah, we'll get this on there, too.
[231:07.19]Yeah.
[231:09.73]Ham ham.
[231:11.23]Good.
[231:15.55]This is good.
[231:16.07]Save it.
[231:30.56]enemy forces occupy Chicago just beat the game I think this is a lot longer than that target areas and liberate the town of Chicago copy that
[231:52.34]Well, if it isn't the heinous terrorist, public enemy number one, Richard!
[231:58.62]Oh, you've done excellent work, Michael.
[232:00.96]How about a reward to show my appreciation?
[232:03.34]This is the 50% point of the whole game?
[232:10.27]Really?
[232:12.31]And Metal Wolf will be blamed for the slaughter of Chicago.
[232:17.88]No, don't start that.
[232:19.38]Oh, I gotta do this fast right now then.
[232:43.77]Coming to you live from the skies over Chicago, this is DNN's Peter McDonald.
[232:49.91]Using poison gas as his weapon of choice, Metal Wolf seeks to obliterate the city of Chicago.
[232:56.52]That coward.
[232:57.90]Even cruelty has a limit.
[233:00.44]But rest assured, I have faith that the U.S.
[233:03.26]military will put a stop to this.
[233:05.86]That journalist is up to his old misinformed tricks again.
[233:09.95]Please hurry, Mr. President.
[233:12.23]I gotta do this fast.
[233:13.75]Here we go!
[233:15.99]I need more firepower than that.
[233:17.45]We'll go ham and ML-14.
[233:19.47]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[233:25.15]What is that?
[233:43.03]Yes!
[233:43.13]Poison gas neutralizer?
[233:44.59]So kill it.
[234:11.24]How are you still alive?
[234:12.36]I gotta get up.
[234:22.57]It's off.
[234:23.03]Where's the gas neutralizers?
[234:26.61]Got it.
[234:27.03]I gotta get up.
[234:35.13]It's off.
[234:41.67]Do I have to walk up this?
[234:51.26]Oh my god, get up there.
[234:52.50]I just want to get on top of the train.
[234:56.44]What the fuck are you doing?
[234:58.70]There's no time for this bullshit, seriously.
[235:17.19]I need another one of those PPMs.
[235:29.37]Come on.
[235:31.17]Hurry up.
[235:41.94]Why did I jump down?
[235:43.12]I saw shiny things, and I was like, ooh, pick it up.
[235:51.48]Oh no!
[235:52.30]According to our own DNN human fatality density measuring device, the density of poison gas in the city has already exceeded 50 parts per million.
[236:02.10]Metawolf is a villain down to his last mecha bolt.
[236:10.39]Oh, he's getting hurt.
[236:18.10]It said don't get up to 200, 300 parts per million.
[236:20.24]Something like that.
[236:23.02]Scientists.
[236:27.38]Alright, I'm gonna get up there.
[236:37.08]Shit.
[236:37.42]I'm gonna go all the way around.
[236:46.17]That drawbridge is a symbol of the city and its rivers.
[236:50.85]Seeing it open is quite a sight, but... If we can't cross, we'll be in a jam.
[236:58.62]Hurry up!
[237:03.04]But... What about the... But what about the other stuff?
[237:11.01]I'm overheating.
[237:13.05]Alright, I'm just gonna... What?
[237:13.97]Alright, I do have to hurry up.
[237:15.75]Move out of my way.
[237:17.65]I need more of those gas can things.
[237:45.41]Hurry up.
[237:46.83]I need it.
[237:47.37]I need it.
[237:47.89]I need it.
[237:48.42]I need it.
[237:48.94]I need it.
[237:49.78]On the other side.
[237:51.90]What a mistake.
[237:54.88]I'm in so much trouble now.
[238:07.07]What's it going to get to?
[238:07.91]What's the lethal one? 120?
[238:17.61]Her defense strength is high against live ammunition.
[238:21.34]Come on.
[238:23.62]Hurry.
[238:27.76]Is there another gas tank thing over here?
[238:29.64]He's gone.
[238:30.36]Shit.
[238:35.52]Not again.
[238:38.82]Another dire blow to the military.
[238:41.18]The military only has three operating bases left.
[238:45.40]Come on.
[238:46.14]Where's one?
[238:49.05]Do you see anything?
[238:49.71]I don't see any.
[238:51.09]Is there one back there?
[239:02.38]I think there might be one behind here.
[239:05.24]No, there's not.
[239:08.46]I'm in trouble.
[239:16.78]Please!
[239:20.23]Why do you take so long?
[239:21.37]The blast- Why does it only take like one hit?
[239:29.84]Gas, gas, gas, gas, gas.
[239:31.02]Looking for it.
[239:31.48]The green thing on the ground.
[239:32.26]Green thing.
[239:32.52]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[239:33.54]No green, no green, no green.
[239:34.53]Don't see any green.
[239:35.09]Don't see any green.
[239:45.36]Only one minute until the density of the poison gas reaches fatal limits.
[239:51.00]No.
[239:51.52]Please hurry, Mr. President.
[239:54.96]I'm trying.
[239:56.08]What do you think I'm doing right now?
[240:03.38]One target area remains.
[240:12.70]Only one remains.
[240:15.29]It's in here.
[240:18.87]Get out of the fucking way.
[240:20.69]It's right there.
[240:21.19]It's up there.
[240:21.91]Just shoot it.
[240:32.84]67.
[240:32.86]Come on.
[240:36.78]No!
[240:37.36]Fatal density is over 170 parts per million.
[240:41.53]Mr. President, the garage damage rate is above 50%.
[240:45.31]Do it!
[240:47.65]It's gonna blow!
[240:49.73]Come on!
[240:52.69]No!
[240:56.03]Oh my god!
[240:57.11]The gas density has exceeded the critical fatality rate.
[241:01.16]An utter nightmare.
[241:04.50]It's over.
[241:06.52]Chicago is shrouded in a mist of evil.
[241:10.58]Certain death is imminent.
[241:15.19]Metawolf, America won't let you get away with this.
[241:18.56]You did this.
[241:19.80]We'll never forgive you for this.
[241:21.81]I got to have faster shooters.
[241:24.41]I didn't realize I had that one.
[241:29.60]Alright, come on.
[241:30.92]Now that I know that... That's not quicker.
[241:32.52]This menu is really fucking annoying me.
[241:33.83]Middle mouse, click, then middle mouse.
[241:35.57]Oh, fuck off.
[241:57.08]The poison gas density has gone down, but don't let down your guard.
[242:02.27]Hurry up, Mr. President.
[242:03.57]What's that?
[242:08.57]What the fuck is going on?
[242:12.83]What?
[242:13.07]Mr. President, that's a tank filled with poisonous gas neutralizers.
[242:17.20]The soldiers must be tired if they left that out in such an obvious place.
[242:23.57]I think I gotta change something.
[242:24.71]I gotta have something else be on the other side.
[242:28.74]Don't even attack people.
[242:30.06]Just go.
[242:31.82]Take out the little canisters and get out of here.
[242:51.39]Alright, I need to go... I need to go over here.
[242:58.38]Is one of those back here?
[242:59.54]Shoot the gun!
[243:02.88]Oh my god, this is grabbing me fucking nuts.
[243:31.78]Alright, let's go backwards.
[243:37.84]No, it ain't even worth using this.
[243:47.85]You just have to use the slow missiles.
[243:51.12]It's gonna go right in the middle.
[244:09.63]Vang right.
[244:18.60]How do I not have any?
[244:21.97]And I mean any boost.
[244:23.23]Like the super move.
[244:25.63]Oh, why isn't it building?
[244:27.51]...DNN human fatality density measuring device.
[244:31.07]The density of poison gas in the city has already exceeded 50 parts per million.
[244:36.20]Metawolf is a villain down to his last mecha bolt.
[244:56.27]Oh shit I was in the explosion I didn't know it was that much explosion was gonna happen look at this fucking FPS on the mouse too by the way like oh my god Enemy
[245:21.87]Each target area has started up their poison gas control.
[245:25.39]If the density of the poison gas exceeds 181 parts per million, human death is guaranteed.
[245:31.84]Destroy the target areas before the density reaches 181.
[245:35.06]What's that?
[245:38.62]The poison gas density has gone down.
[245:41.02]But don't let down your guard.
[245:43.33]Hurry up, Mr. President.
[245:45.65]What's that?
[245:55.34]Oh my god, never say that again.
[245:56.94]I'm gonna turn voice off.
[245:59.99]Can I turn cutscenes off?
[246:26.12]His crazy chin is very...
[247:00.95]What are you doing, shoot it?
[247:03.71]Why is it doing that?
[247:20.64]I'm trying.
[247:23.98]Don't die by the explosions here.
[247:28.54]Mr. President!
[247:29.28]Be careful out there!
[247:30.22]Relax, I'll be fine.
[247:57.41]Why won't this gun fire?
[247:59.69]The gun has to cool?
[248:00.87]How much does this gun have to cool?
[248:02.07]It's gonna happen again!
[248:06.38]Why can't I fire the... Is it the energy gun?
[248:08.16]That's why?
[248:08.56]Okay, no, no, I gotta go across this bridge.
[248:33.06]No?
[248:33.40]Where's that coming from?
[248:40.44]Straight to the right, yeah.
[248:41.16]Wait, doesn't it?
[248:41.78]Yeah, okay, there it is.
[248:50.88]Um, what?
[248:54.84]That was bullshit.
[248:55.63]You guys saw that.
[248:56.89]What?
[248:57.39]Look at how slow this is going.
[249:02.88]You saw that.
[249:03.66]I didn't even need to pretend.
[249:04.68]I don't even need to act, you know what I'm saying?
[249:06.80]I don't even need to pretend.
[249:07.74]I don't need to get my, like, acting skills out, you know what I'm saying?
[249:22.19]I gotta bring out this... I gotta... I have to...
[249:36.47]Is there any more of those things?
[249:41.32]96?
[249:41.54]I feel like I'm behind.
[249:51.17]No!
[249:51.71]Don't fire that.
[249:52.53]Idiot.
[249:54.19]Alright, alright.
[249:54.67]There's only two more.
[249:55.57]Straight ahead.
[250:06.73]No, it's on the other side.
[250:07.59]Oh, god damn it.
[250:09.86]It's about to end there.
[250:13.54]That's not where to get it from here.
[250:18.30]I have to go all the way around.
[250:23.59]The end at this one.
[250:25.31]It's going to happen again.
[250:28.79]No, it's not.
[250:30.39]Because this time I actually have... I have... Shut up.
[250:38.08]Where is this one?
[250:41.62]I have to go around here, down and through this alley to get in here?
[250:44.86]Is there... above the train?
[250:48.54]I'm confused on that one.
[250:59.04]Just take it out.
[250:59.64]Hurry up.
[251:00.08]I got time.
[251:00.84]One target area remains.
[251:03.96]The final spot, Mr. President.
[251:06.77]Go, hurry up.
[251:10.88]Please, get up there.
[251:20.21]Please, God.
[251:20.77]Oh my god, I don't even need to do that.
[251:24.35]I got it, I'm done.
[251:27.91]One minute until the density of the poison gas reaches fatal limits.
[251:31.75]At this rate, the density will exceed 181 ppm.
[251:34.84]Please hurry, Mr. President.
[251:36.46]Where's the last one?
[251:57.06]Where is it?
[251:57.40]There's nothing on the screen.
[252:04.47]Where is it?
[252:20.33]An utter nightmare.
[252:22.22]The US military has been demolished once again by Metal Wolf.
[252:27.28]However, his plan to gas the town ended in failure.
[252:32.92]Could it be that the hand of God reached down to save us?
[252:38.94]Uh-oh.
[252:39.94]I've just looked into the eyes of Metal Wolf.
[252:42.47]Any further reporting is too dangerous.
[252:44.91]Our news team is seeking refuge.
[252:47.11]This guy.
[252:47.91]But our coverage of these events will continue.
[252:51.05]I hate this guy.
[252:53.15]He's the worst.
[252:54.26]Because, yes, the pen is still mightier than the sword.
[252:59.26]This has been Peter McDonald for DNN.
[253:04.52]I'll say one thing for the guy.
[253:06.12]At least his misreporting is consistent.
[253:11.30]As long as the city is safe, who cares?
[253:13.60]I hope he can just strangle him in the end.
[253:26.97]What the fuck?
[253:32.59]Oh, that's funny.
[253:38.00]uh uh he thought that yeah fortunately president wiffle stepped in and put a halt you guys make me like laugh way too much today god is made of steel did you get in touch with the resistance that's not even what that said no still no word maybe he was captured by coup d'etat forces
[254:08.69]No, he'd never let that happen I'm sure he's out there waiting to make his move I made him a promise.
[254:20.28]Oh, Mr.. President I'm off to the next battlefront I
[254:28.73]Alright, let's go to... Let's go here.
[254:30.31]Got a McChicken?
[254:30.85]Ooh, that sounds pretty good.
[254:31.95]Is this going to be a McChicken stream?
[254:33.27]Absolutely.
[254:48.59]React swiftly as paratrooper reinforcements are predicted to be dropped in from super assault heavy attack helicopters.
[254:55.49]The objective is total destruction of all target areas and the super assault heavy attack Olajuwon helicopter.
[255:03.46]This mission goes by the call name... Winner take all.
[255:09.84]Olajuwon versus Metalwoe.
[255:12.52]What's the best way to burn body fat?
[255:14.16]Eat less food?
[255:19.07]And move around.
[255:20.73]Here we go.
[255:22.57]I did... Didn't I want to buy one of these new ones?
[255:35.50]I didn't have money for it, right?
[255:40.70]No, it was the new assault rifle.
[255:46.70]I'm going to do missile launcher.
[255:52.98]Sam.
[255:54.78]Let's take a look.
[256:02.63]An advanced missile launcher intended for service to air strikes.
[256:06.31]That's a lot of firepower.
[256:11.87]I'll give it a try.
[256:22.54]This thing is good for just, like, panic oh shit moments.
[256:25.79]I like this combo.
[256:26.69]Though this is... used to be the... No, that's the best one I have.
[256:29.71]I can buy the other one, but I haven't done it yet.
[256:31.01]The two hams.
[256:33.59]Let's replace... This energy weapon thing.
[256:37.43]I'm not liking it.
[256:38.15]It takes too much.
[256:39.07]I don't like it.
[256:41.39]I'm gonna put on the sand here.
[256:44.96]It is better than this, though, by a lot.
[256:56.97]When am I going to come back to Canada?
[256:57.97]This is DNN's Peter McDonald reporting.
[257:00.06]I'm coming to you live today from a U.S.
[257:02.86]military base in the outskirts of Houston, Texas.
[257:07.56]Scarce natural resources sent from the space plane center are collected and kept here.
[257:14.76]The U.S.
[257:15.36]military is collectively managing these goods under martial law.
[257:20.88]Acting as the defense for this area is this super assault heavy attack Elijah Juan helicopter.
[257:27.04]What about Boston?
[257:27.60]Well, my Boston accent says it's an active... Take a look at this firepower.
[257:32.61]44mm M197 anti-aircraft guns.
[257:36.89]80mm Bow Force anti-aircraft cannons.
[257:39.91]Two 10mm grenade launchers.
[257:42.92]And finally, 12 missile containers.
[257:44.74]Can I fight this?
[257:46.85]in addition to this heavy arsenal it has the capacity to hold over a hundred soldiers a veritable flying fortress as long as the Elijah one is on the scene metal wolf get off the winds here fly this little helicopter this little rinky-dink helicopter out of the way we'll just shoot the thousand meters Mr. newsman
[258:17.03]That's a pretty good card drop sound effect.
[258:19.37]The Elyjawan appears to be dropping parachute troops from his cargo bay.
[258:23.93]It'll be trouble when those reinforcements land.
[258:26.39]Destroy the target areas while shooting down the enemy dropping into the battle.
[258:30.64]Alright, let's go.
[258:37.36]What are those?
[258:38.18]Discs?
[258:39.44]Those must be some new kinds of weapons.
[258:41.90]Mines?
[258:42.42]They're being dropped one after another from the Elyjawan.
[258:46.18]Metal Wolf will have no choice but to deal with this firepower.
[258:56.72]Metal Wolf's... ...swapping to our next group.
[259:10.82]I got ya!
[259:11.08]The Elite Power Trooper Sniper Unit.
[259:12.58]What's the order over here?
[259:13.88]Well, you know what happens?
[259:15.16]Like, doesn't David win?
[259:15.98]It's not great.
[259:16.38]David wins.
[259:16.69]He throws a rock at the giant's face and hits it right in the skull.
[259:20.53]And, like, knocks him out and kills him.
[259:23.39]Right?
[259:40.45]You should knock out the launch bay doors that drop the bombs.
[259:43.47]First, start by reducing the strong attack.
[259:46.45]That device seems to have improved the guidance function performance of the smart bomb.
[259:51.04]Bible spoilers.
[259:53.00]The performance of the smart bomb seems to have fallen off.
[260:00.02]If there's no guidance device, it's flying blind.
[260:02.67]Alright.
[260:03.49]I'm going to do a hamster.
[260:08.52]That guy does look pretty elite.
[260:33.58]Damn.
[260:37.05]These things gotta go.
[260:38.81]That hurts.
[260:48.51]Ow.
[260:48.83]Well, jeez.
[260:49.69]Oh, my God.
[260:50.71]You get down here, then.
[260:51.83]You see what I'm dealing with?
[261:05.84]I'm fighting everybody by myself.
[261:07.50]I don't have any health.
[261:23.41]Not as well, right?
[261:33.30]I just don't have time.
[261:34.16]Alright, that's it, right?
[261:36.38]Just gotta go for him now?
[261:41.16]I don't think so.
[261:42.18]Maybe I can.
[261:47.37]Ah, what?
[261:48.13]I guess I can.
[261:57.34]It did take damage, you know?
[262:08.17]Holy shit, that thing is awesome.
[262:10.62]It's getting a little bit closer.
[262:18.80]No wonder he's breached.
[262:23.47]Kinda, yeah.
[262:27.35]Alright, let's get the SAM.
[262:30.95]A little more range.
[262:38.62]I'm just going to hang out back here.
[262:40.04]Is that not reaching?
[262:43.05]Why are these not reaching?
[262:45.13]What?
[262:45.71]No.
[262:55.98]I'm not going to get closer than that.
[263:01.26]That hit, right?
[263:02.68]I don't think so.
[263:09.21]Middle Wolf is trying to escape from the base.
[263:11.67]I don't think this is working.
[263:28.60]They got to kill these things.
[263:46.86]You just gotta do it.
[263:48.85]Um, I guess.
[263:53.57]Maybe it has to lock on.
[263:55.19]Maybe.
[263:56.37]Awesome.
[264:00.13]Let me try to clear these out.
[264:02.99]These little, like, crabs.
[264:06.61]You'll get close when there's no more left.
[264:08.05]Is he going forward or backward?
[264:40.73]Is that it?
[265:05.95]There's apparently something behind me.
[265:07.89]Over here.
[265:10.19]I guess I have to destroy this thing.
[265:14.53]Of course!
[265:16.71]I was doing damage to him.
[265:20.95]That's weird.
[265:24.24]This is the last radar, and he comes in.
[265:29.78]I'm gonna wait until he destroys his radars.
[265:43.49]This is the only other target on the map.
[265:44.67]Dotted Bomb Billy the Priest.
[265:50.94]Take a look at that.
[265:53.94]The U.S.
[265:54.66]ground forces have been totally decimated by the hand of Metal Wolf.
[266:00.90]But we still have the Speed Ace up our sleeve.
[266:05.96]That trump card being the Super Assault Heavy Attack Elijah Wan helicopter.
[266:12.47]That's the guy that announces that it's his turn.
[266:15.81]It's my turn!
[266:17.29]That's the name of his attack.
[266:18.87]He rushes in and he goes like, HYAAAAA and then gets fucking knocked out of the air like a fly.
[266:31.80]You go like, HMMMMMMMM.
[266:34.24]Dash forward, dead.
[266:39.49]That happens in every single cartoon.
[266:40.85]It doesn't matter if it's a Japanese anime or not.
[266:42.45]It could be an American anime.
[266:55.61]Use his cover.
[266:56.65]And let's end the mission right now!
[266:59.59]I don't know why I just scraped that.
[267:01.99]That was too odd.
[267:02.47]How about I just kill it?
[267:25.03]You know, why didn't I just- The Super Assault Olajuwon helicopter!
[267:43.42]The helicopter the military said could never be shot down.
[267:46.92]This aerial fortress has been destroyed by one single foe dressed in mobile attack armor.
[267:54.39]But I will never give up hope.
[267:57.51]And hope will never yield to violence.
[268:00.79]I believe in American justice and my journalistic convictions.
[268:06.07]Because yes, the pen is still mightier than the sword.
[268:11.38]This has been Peter McDonald for DNN.
[268:15.20]Hey, Mr. Journalist, take a good long look.
[268:19.84]I think it's time for a new pen.
[268:25.91]Quick strangle before he gets away.
[268:27.45]Yeah.
[268:41.89]Two hundred and twenty... Two hundred and... Three hundred thousand?
[268:44.64]262 Ending that rationing system Have I been getting this man all wrong?
[269:11.16]Jody, what's the situation on the ground across America?
[269:14.76]Cruel oppression of US citizens still continues all over the nation.
[269:18.85]Are we done yet?
[269:20.29]I guess neither of us will see any time off soon.
[269:22.65]We're very close.
[269:23.65]I'm off to the next battle zone.
[269:25.69]Yes, Mr. President.
[269:30.77]We're almost done.
[269:35.51]We almost got the entire United States safe and reclaimed.
[269:43.40]The enemy force sends out over 1,000 citizens a day from Miami, trafficking them into overseas white slavery.
[269:51.57]The command cruiser moored on the coast directs troops in the Atlantic.
[269:55.43]It has long-range, high-powered missiles on board.
[269:58.37]Stay on constant guard.
[270:01.35]Many helicopters join the defense.
[270:03.58]Concentrate your attacks on intercepting these cannonballs.
[270:07.00]The objective is the destruction of all target areas.
[270:09.76]This mission goes by the call name...
[270:14.58]I need some more data here.
[270:30.85]I want to buy the next assault rifle.
[270:33.33]In fact, I think we're just going straight up to buy the next one too.
[270:36.35]How much is the assault rifle?
[270:37.97]Like 60?
[270:38.37]70?
[270:38.47]I'm going for it.
[270:40.61]Who cares?
[270:46.33]I have it all.
[270:52.51]Fuck.
[270:53.34]I keep pricing myself out.
[270:56.12]I'll get it next time.
[271:00.02]This thing is ridiculous.
[271:01.64]Incredibly long range and firepower.
[271:04.90]Fires rebounding lasers.
[271:07.92]An assault rifle with the longest range of any standard arms weapon.
[271:11.89]An assault rifle used by cyborgs.
[271:13.43]Yes, cyborgs!
[271:19.46]That's the first thing I'm buying.
[271:24.42]I just got this one.
[271:30.31]How much is it to upgrade this one more time?
[271:33.95]I can't do it again.
[271:49.78]Uh, I'm just, I have to stick with this.
[272:01.05]This is kind of what I got.
[272:04.83]That battle cruiser is the command ship directing the Atlantic Ocean troops in this area.
[272:10.70]attack the cruiser and the coup d'etat forces legally enjoying their holiday and Sink them to the bottom of this grand ocean copy that For their sakes.
[272:23.63]I hope they enjoyed their last R&R The Navy Cruiser will fire powerful long-range missiles sure it will Bombers are approaching bombers
[272:39.78]This is going to kill you in one hit, right?
[272:44.64]The bomber group seems to have received a request from the target area and is on their way.
[272:49.34]The bombing will be dangerous.
[272:51.08]Bombing will begin.
[272:51.62]You should sever the reinforcements ahead of time.
[272:54.08]Long-range missiles are approaching.
[272:56.13]Watch out for aerial attack.
[272:58.13]Alright.
[272:58.57]How many times do you have to say the same thing before I know what you're talking about?
[273:06.05]That's good.
[273:06.59]Keep going.
[273:08.70]I want the handle.
[273:11.72]More long range missiles.
[273:13.24]These attacks will rage on unless you wipe out the launch source.
[273:17.55]I'm trying.
[273:27.69]Well, their flight patterns will probably be from the direction at 12 o'clock.
[273:33.52]12 o'clock?
[273:34.28]OK.
[273:34.48]Mr. President, are you alright?
[273:40.56]and you got landmines on here too the missiles are airborne where they come from
[274:11.27]Oh!
[274:11.77]That hurt.
[274:15.92]Oh!
[274:17.12]Release.
[274:17.66]Some scientists were among the POWs you rescued.
[274:20.72]They were worked to the bone without any vacation, maintaining that battle cruiser.
[274:25.82]Mr. President.
[274:34.83]Every time I step on her mind, she just goes, Mister!
[274:37.57]It's like, oh, just stop watching the screen.
[274:39.63]Just turn off the screen.
[274:41.31]Is that the Eagle of the Atlantic?
[274:43.61]Brigadier General Robert Forrester?
[274:45.17]I'll, like, call you if I need something.
[274:46.67]You're a former commander.
[274:48.80]Metal Wolf, I don't know what you're up to.
[274:54.96]Or who is inside of there.
[274:58.36]But I can tell you this.
[275:00.94]You're...
[275:03.62]Your public enemy number one.
[275:08.28]Going head to head with this kind of firepower isn't the smart way.
[275:12.68]Start by crushing the gun batteries.
[275:14.54]The defense strength is high against live ammunition.
[275:17.44]I'm going to clear out the beach first.
[275:20.76]I'm going to do some long range bullshit.
[275:25.49]A musician was among the POWs you rescued.
[275:28.49]He was surely forced to play the ukulele on the beach.
[275:32.09]Alright, what am I looking at here?
[275:33.37]I'm thinking to him.
[275:34.23]What's the weak point here?
[275:35.17]I just gotta get this truck out of the way.
[275:56.88]That didn't even hurt it.
[275:58.48]And this is barely hurting this.
[276:00.12]Go up to the radar.
[276:01.08]Knock down that tower.
[276:02.48]Wow, I got frozen.
[276:04.70]I couldn't...
[276:29.44]fire fire fire okay so uh that's how you instantly die the navy cruiser you'll need constant warning Mr. president
[276:52.26]the bomber crew seems to have received a request from the target area and is on their way the bombing will be dangerous you should sever the reinforcements ahead of time long-range missiles are approaching
[277:24.38]more long-range missiles these attacks will rage on unless you wipe out the launch force Mr. president are you alright oh laying out landmines on the beach they should give a little pause to the summer swimmers and vacationers
[278:05.01]Can I take them?
[278:05.77]Oh, I'm not sure anymore.
[278:14.00]This is good.
[278:16.76]This is good.
[278:24.76]Again.
[278:25.02]I need, like, one more thing to...
[278:39.05]Goodbye.
[278:40.27]Good.
[278:40.49]Alright, that was quick.
[278:43.48]I have a full of barrage thing.
[278:49.08]I'm ready.
[278:51.47]Oh, bingo.
[278:57.50]All the target areas have been destroyed.
[278:59.99]Only the battle cruiser remains.
[279:02.01]Now get cracking.
[279:03.53]A musician was among the POWs you rescued.
[279:06.51]He was surely forced to play the ukulele on the beach.
[279:09.65]Some scientists were among the POWs you rescued.
[279:12.90]They were worked to the bone without any vacation maintaining that battle cruiser.
[279:17.52]Alright.
[279:22.44]Watch out for that shit.
[279:25.53]Now...
[279:27.24]It's a question of... Give me the... Hit the Sam.
[279:32.61]Oh, shit.
[279:35.99]That's so many.
[279:36.87]Is it gonna reach?
[279:42.67]I don't see anything that destroys... I'm just going for the bugs.
[279:58.62]What the fuck are you aiming at?
[279:59.94]Where are you supposed to just go?
[280:08.32]Alright, this is fucking blowing my mind right now.
[280:23.18]Oh fuck.
[280:29.07]The long range missiles from that Navy cruiser are on a collision course.
[280:34.03]Please do not be caught off guard.
[280:37.31]How do you like me now?
[280:55.65]I did something.
[281:10.88]You have way more missiles than I do.
[281:22.18]It's a job to just dance around.
[281:23.76]If you get hit by a barrage, the game's over.
[281:47.50]I can't even target this because it's like... What am I aiming at?
[281:57.39]Well, the thing is, I can't even describe it.
[281:59.87]If the game has a target, they will shoot there no matter what.
[282:03.31]It's a fucking pain in the ass.
[282:17.96]Added bullets on this thing.
[282:28.02]Added bullets on this thing too!
[282:29.14]Regroup.
[282:29.36]Chin.
[282:29.64]That's all you need to say.
[282:31.74]It's just chin.
[282:52.79]Sailors!
[282:53.64]Abandon your post!
[282:55.16]Hurry and escape!
[282:57.72]Grab any wounded and run!
[283:00.10]General!
[283:04.00]You run away too!
[283:05.62]We military men will never be cowardly lambs.
[283:10.29]We're brave lions until the end.
[283:14.89]Now carry out your duty.
[283:17.59]Carry out your own justice.
[283:28.61]Mr. President, the battlecruiser has sunk.
[283:32.91]Now the beach will be crowded with vacationers once again.
[283:35.91]Vacationers?
[283:37.97]Yeah, for those who survived.
[283:42.75]Great going, Mr. President.
[283:46.35]It's like broken glass everywhere.
[283:47.97]No one's going to come vacation here for a while.
[283:49.55]We need to clean this fucking place up.
[283:53.37]This damn place has got glass and shrapnel.
[283:59.86]Alright, I'm buying the Assault Rifle.
[284:01.88]And then we're doing the final mission.
[284:06.87]I'm not going to forget about the Cyborg Rifle.
[284:15.95]Mm-hmm.
[284:17.09]Something cruiser.
[284:18.03]Rich ecosystem that teems with marine life, including new species of coral, which I'm sure you've heard of.
[284:24.06]Sea Forester, in honor of Brigadier General Robert Forester.
[284:29.25]Let his tragedy never be repeated.
[284:31.11]OK.
[284:31.45]What's the pulse of the nation say about all this?
[284:33.75]Citizens have already begun to wake up to the vice president's evil intentions.
[284:39.09]He's evil.
[284:40.07]They couldn't stage a revolt in time.
[284:44.35]Just the thought of a revolt is enough.
[284:47.06]I'll take back the nation soon.
[284:48.98]Full speed ahead.
[284:50.98]I'm with you all the way, Mr. President.
[284:56.86]Alright.
[284:59.14]Let's go.
[284:59.86]There's a super weapon.
[285:01.25]So this is one of those big giant cannons?
[285:02.99]Let's go.
[285:30.24]Buy that weapon.
[285:31.46]Upgrade it.
[285:32.84]Laser rifle, we're good.
[285:36.16]And this is probably one of the last missions in the game.
[285:37.98]But this one's probably a few more.
[285:39.42]No, no, no, no, no.
[285:41.72]Not investment.
[285:48.05]This one here.
[285:48.69]E-N-R-F-C-B.
[285:52.77]Got it.
[285:53.03]Might as well get one of the other ones, too.
[285:57.85]Longest range...
[285:59.63]Rebounding lasers.
[286:03.76]I'm going to do longest range.
[286:04.94]This one.
[286:05.24]I don't think I have enough.
[286:06.68]I don't have enough rare metal for that.
[286:10.32]Oh, never mind.
[286:14.47]Although I can do missiles one more time, right?
[286:16.33]Yeah.
[286:16.81]Let's do it.
[286:21.23]The P is available.
[286:22.85]Let's see if it does.
[286:29.11]An advanced missile launcher capable of penetrating multiple targets.
[286:31.47]That's pretty good.
[286:32.02]I might get that.
[286:36.60]In the meantime, let me put on that new thing that I got.
[286:40.94]That's fine.
[286:43.02]I'm going to replace this with that.
[286:47.78]Looks kind of cool.
[286:51.12]Powerful rounds that exceed the energy output.
[286:53.71]The hams, I'm getting rid of these.
[286:56.41]Everyone told me these are the worst.
[286:59.66]That's even worse.
[287:03.68]I need something better.
[287:04.62]And this one, QLS, yeah.
[287:08.28]No, not enough.
[287:13.19]What should I put here instead?
[287:15.41]I could, no, I'm gonna get, yeah, this is very, very useful.
[287:18.13]It's good just to clear out little things.
[287:27.77]I will keep this SG-55.
[287:28.91]And I'm gonna replace... Eh.
[287:35.33]Eh.
[287:35.73]No, no, no, the other one I had was better, wasn't it?
[287:38.89]No, it wasn't.
[287:43.83]It was not.
[287:44.39]Yes, it was.
[287:45.32]No, it's not.
[287:46.36]This is the better one.
[287:47.04]800?
[287:49.94]Yeah, this is the better one.
[287:55.98]Save it, and let's go.
[288:01.46]This clock is wrong.
[288:04.54]What is it?
[288:10.67]Final mission.
[288:11.33]Of the base game.
[288:12.21]The DLC is happening.
[288:12.95]Okay, that thing's huge.
[288:13.53]Giant spider?
[288:13.79]Talk about massive arm.
[288:14.71]What is that?
[288:15.15]Carnival ride?
[288:32.58]Hello, hello, hello.
[288:34.98]Hello, Michael.
[288:36.49]How's life treating you?
[288:39.02]Richard.
[288:39.94]What do you think of my cute little pet?
[288:42.72]Thanks to him, the people of New York City are right now festively running around and trying to escape.
[288:51.35]It's like a big ol' carnival.
[288:53.41]It's like Mardi Gras in New York or something.
[288:57.13]You are a sick pet.
[288:58.95]Take a bite from its super energy weight phaser.
[289:01.95]It'll get you high enough to reach heaven.
[289:05.56]So I'll right up in the middle.
[289:08.10]Definitely shoot in the middle.
[289:11.60]Asperitis.
[289:16.08]I'm already dead.
[289:18.52]It already almost instantly killed me.
[289:21.72]I'm dead.
[289:33.83]Alright, well, so.
[289:35.67]Mr. President, please get up.
[289:38.21]If you lose in New York, won't it be the same as him broadcasting those phony news stories, Mr. President?
[289:49.62]I know, Judy.
[289:50.52]Don't worry.
[289:54.53]Get out of the way.
[289:55.21]If what you said is true, this will be dangerous.
[289:58.41]Run away for now, Mr. President.
[290:03.59]There's a power recharge facility.
[290:06.45]I'll go get it.
[290:07.33]That's what I'm doing, Judy.
[290:09.32]I already see it.
[290:58.92]Where is that spider thing right now?
[291:00.72]Oh god.
[291:13.97]Don't kill me!
[291:15.65]What the hell was that?
[291:46.25]He's already here.
[291:47.19]He's close.
[291:47.71]He's too close.
[291:49.61]Oh shit!
[291:52.86]I can't.
[291:53.20]I have to wrap back around.
[292:00.70]Look at these little spiders.
[292:01.70]Is this his power cells or something?
[292:23.63]Got a lot of power cells, man.
[292:26.37]Some scientists were among the POWs you rescued.
[292:28.73]They were used to research weapons of mass destruction.
[292:32.76]A musician was among the POWs you rescued.
[292:35.92]Once again, there will be music on Broadway.
[292:39.10]How the hell am I supposed to take out that?
[292:44.48]I'm right under him.
[292:46.09]Oh my god.
[292:47.13]When his phaser banks are out of energy, he has to go for a recharge.
[292:51.79]Is that what he's doing?
[292:52.53]I guess he's recharging his battery.
[293:14.02]I thought I could do it.
[293:14.94]I had an opportunity.
[293:15.84]I thought I was gonna take it.
[293:17.90]If I had that thing, I thought I had that, um, the supercharge thing.
[293:22.52]Ugh, that's so aggravating.
[293:24.44]I thought I had it.
[293:25.50]I was gonna just aim up and kill it.
[293:27.59]What?
[293:31.42]Oh, that sucks.
[293:33.30]How long?
[293:33.96]What is it?
[293:34.78]Is that rocket number, like, 15?
[294:02.77]that's rocket like number 30. is it my shooting out air gas or I don't understand why sometimes it don't work
[294:35.79]Some scientists who are among the POWs you rescued are used to research weapons of mass destruction.
[294:55.05]Why am I using a red candy?
[294:56.75]I don't know
[295:25.69]Is he here yet?
[295:26.23]There he is.
[295:26.76]Just move the fuck out of here.
[295:38.92]I don't know how far away was that.
[295:57.64]I guess I was still too close.
[295:59.76]If what he said is true, this will be dangerous.
[296:03.53]Run away for now, Mr. President.
[296:06.95]I don't understand.
[296:08.45]That's how you get this energy wave fire power from a power recharge facility.
[296:13.00]Each target area obtains powerful electromagnetic armor energy.
[296:16.98]The origin of the energy supply should be cut off first.
[296:29.45]That's the slowest I've ever seen that happen.
[296:34.72]What the fuck happened?
[296:36.56]The spider's not even near me!
[296:39.40]I don't- is something- what am I missing?
[296:45.11]The guy was down the street!
[296:49.21]If what he said is true, this'll be dangerous.
[296:52.87]Run away for now, Mr. President.
[296:57.12]you have to go so fast and then you've run out of boost and you just sit there overheated I'm just gonna keep moving
[297:32.81]Alright, here he is.
[297:39.70]I'm going to get out of here.
[297:54.73]Right ahead.
[298:10.79]I had the target a second ago.
[298:12.98]I didn't even move.
[298:14.32]I'm so disappointed.
[298:16.42]I didn't even move from the spot and I lost the target.
[298:22.19]And now I have to leave.
[298:36.32]If I don't beat this game, the US is finished.
[298:40.20]After I do New York.
[298:43.10]We'll see.
[298:54.20]Let's get away from him to recharge.
[298:58.32]I guess that makes sense.
[299:11.62]Am I far enough away from this dickhead?
[299:12.88]He's not just gonna turn the corner and be here, right?
[299:23.09]Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm.
[299:44.47]He's walking... which way is he walking?
[299:48.82]I'm not going to run into him, am I?
[300:01.31]No, he's far away.
[300:02.21]Okay.
[300:07.47]Jump!
[300:08.33]What are you doing?
[300:15.93]Oh, fuck!
[300:17.39]He's- AH!
[300:18.35]No!
[300:18.65]What the fuck?!
[300:19.73]I was so far away!
[300:21.35]He's like-
[300:46.31]Fucking half mile down the street.
[300:55.89]It's a super long... I just... This thing just said, fail better.
[301:00.31]I gotta achieve this.
[301:01.77]This is fail better.
[301:03.01]Why did they remaster this game?
[301:05.68]What was the point of this?
[301:06.86]Okay.
[301:39.05]Why weren't they remastered like King's Field or something?
[301:43.07]Or like an Armored Core game.
[301:44.26]Why this one?
[301:45.60]I'm just genuinely curious.
[301:47.64]Why?
[301:48.08]Why this?
[301:53.34]It was never released outside Japan.
[302:01.30]Oh, that makes sense.
[302:03.84]Alright, where is he?
[302:06.38]Does he even show up on the map?
[302:07.74]I don't think he does.
[302:17.05]I think we're safe.
[302:48.80]Is he still here?
[302:50.10]No.
[302:50.44]Oh, God.
[302:50.96]He's still here.
[302:51.52]He's right here, though.
[302:53.32]Let's get the ski around and try to take out one at a time.
[302:57.35]Because it's panic though throughout the whole damn map.
[303:01.75]Get out.
[303:03.87]Which way is he going?
[303:04.58]I don't know.
[303:09.12]He's over here.
[303:22.32]No, I don't even get it.
[303:35.62]Just go.
[303:50.40]Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.
[304:04.95]Crickets.
[304:07.73]Oh shit, I'm not being very funny.
[304:09.83]All I hear are crickets.
[304:12.13]Where's the next one?
[304:13.70]Up and to the left.
[304:19.15]XD.
[304:20.97]Where is he now?
[304:21.45]Is he gonna go straight or is he gonna go this way?
[304:25.70]I think he's retarded.
[304:27.86]He's moving this way.
[304:38.71]Straight ahead.
[304:42.81]Alright, he's... I got time.
[304:46.44]Those U-type weapons self-destruct when they draw near.
[304:50.18]Don't give it the right of way.
[304:51.89]Destroy it before it gets any closer.
[304:54.23]Where the fuck is he?
[304:57.65]I don't know.
[305:02.31]Where is he?
[305:02.92]Where is he?
[305:06.12]I don't know.
[305:10.24]Where is he?
[305:11.28]This is freaking me out that he's not here.
[305:25.05]Where is he?
[305:26.01]No, out, out, out.
[305:26.87]He's probably coming.
[305:41.58]There he is.
[305:41.90]Okay, get out.
[305:42.44]Now I can do one more shot.
[305:45.11]Please target that.
[305:46.51]Not the guy on the ground.
[305:50.60]Out of time.
[305:51.26]I don't care.
[305:53.24]I'm not gonna get killed by that fucking thing.
[305:55.46]I can wrap all the way around.
[305:59.78]I'm gonna run out of ammunition, too.
[306:02.02]Ammunition's gonna be gone.
[306:05.29]I gotta switch weapons.
[306:18.61]Okay, now straight ahead.
[306:33.19]He's going to be up here, isn't he?
[306:36.43]Yeah, he's right there.
[306:44.04]Just going to wait for him for a second to get that last one down.
[306:47.12]Alright.
[306:48.42]Cut the corner.
[306:54.34]Put this on a little bit.
[307:32.19]What the fuck am I doing over here?
[307:36.79]Where?
[307:40.82]Where is he?
[307:46.88]I have no idea.
[307:49.06]I got the wrong fucking things out.
[307:53.83]Eight shots left in this thing.
[307:55.41]Where did he go?
[307:56.11]I don't know where he is.
[307:57.89]Uh, I'm just gonna go straight ahead.
[307:59.11]Hope I don't run into him.
[308:12.34]Be behind me.
[308:12.92]Come on.
[308:17.54]This is exact- He was right here before.
[308:20.99]Where did he go?
[308:21.67]Did he just follow me down?
[308:27.59]Oh my fucking god, I'm going to scream in this game's face.
[308:31.01]No, I'm not actually.
[308:34.05]What the fuck are these things everywhere?
[308:55.73]What is shocking me?
[308:58.07]I'm about to rage quit the game.
[308:59.21]I'm about to turn it off.
[309:02.41]I'm so confused.
[309:21.22]Yeah.
[309:32.91]What is going- it's my shield low?
[309:34.87]That's what that's trying to tell me?
[309:35.81]It's pretty distracting.
[309:42.66]Where's the big snake thing?
[309:56.24]Where's the big spider thing?
[309:57.28]I don't see him.
[310:06.89]That's not him?
[310:07.53]Where is he?
[310:28.46]Oh, you blocked me with your shield?
[310:31.04]That's unbelievable.
[310:33.36]You hold that up as a guy that's a 50,000 pound mech charging towards you and I bounce off of your riot shield?
[310:41.14]What?
[310:43.23]That's impossible.
[310:47.45]Impossible.
[310:47.93]I'm going this way.
[311:10.13]That massive weapon gets its energy waste power from an energy fill station.
[311:14.21]Go recharge.
[311:14.93]Destroy the energy fill station in town before doing anything else.
[311:21.39]What the?
[311:22.51]What happened?
[311:23.21]What?
[311:24.35]They exploded on me.
[311:25.13]Okay, that's it.
[311:25.49]They're all gone.
[311:26.11]There's only a couple more left.
[311:27.97]No, it's not.
[311:28.25]It's still there.
[311:36.17]There's still shit over there.
[311:40.13]Damn, these fucking things.
[311:41.07]I gotta know my ammo on this gun.
[311:45.33]Where is he?
[311:45.75]Alright, he's going to the fuel station.
[311:48.47]That gives me an opportunity to do this.
[311:51.16]Right?
[311:51.38]He's charging?
[311:52.34]I don't even know if he's charging.
[311:53.48]I can't even tell.
[311:53.98]I think he's on his way back over here.
[311:58.08]I'm gonna wrap around and blow those all up.
[312:13.96]I have no more amulet.
[312:16.08]There you go.
[312:21.76]Enough?
[312:23.63]Anything?
[312:24.09]Anything in your box for me?
[312:25.37]Anything!
[312:41.12]Bonus puns.
[312:42.27]I don't... Oh my god.
[312:43.15]I'm just going... I don't know where I should go first.
[313:11.25]I'm just going to go to the recharge facility first.
[313:15.61]Or, I think I'm just going to delete the game from my end fucking steam engine.
[313:19.51]That sounds like a better idea.
[313:20.87]Just literally remove this game and uninstall it and pretend I never bought it.
[313:27.09]That sounds good too.
[313:27.85]I'm not sure which one of those things I'm going to do first.
[313:43.80]Where's the recharge station?
[314:07.14]Alright, hi spider, I'm gonna destroy all your stuff.
[314:20.22]There you are!
[314:22.18]Stay with my nest!
[314:30.29]Enough warming up!
[314:32.21]Get in the game, sir!
[314:48.53]I'm just gonna pretend I beat the game after I hit this.
[314:51.73]If I even come close to beating it.
[314:52.85]This is really powerful.
[315:09.72]Glad I spent 300 fucking thousand dollars on that thing.
[315:12.48]What a powerful gun.
[315:28.17]Why did I ever do anything besides missiles?
[315:29.65]What was I thinking?
[315:30.33]What's wrong with me?
[315:36.13]What, so I can shoot the guys in the infantry faster?
[315:39.55]What on Earth was I doing?
[315:56.82]There he is.
[316:00.13]Do I have a second here?
[316:33.53]Where is he?
[316:47.41]Dude, all I care about- I'm so paranoid about the spider because he can kill you from a mile away!
[316:56.86]Mr. President, the fuselage damage rate is over 70%.
[317:00.99]Mr. President, I'm sure you just overworked, but are you okay?
[317:05.61]I wish I could hang up on you.
[317:06.63]I really do.
[317:07.49]I would pay $1,000 to hang up on you right now.
[317:12.67]There he is.
[317:13.27]Hey, it's me!
[317:14.57]Hey, here comes a fucking plasma cannon!
[317:18.35]Oh, I missed and shot it into the ground.
[317:19.95]Whoops.
[317:21.07]First time I've ever missed you.
[317:22.69]Are you down the whole street?
[317:24.37]I'll get you now.
[317:37.57]What the fuck is this goddamn game?
[317:55.21]enemy forces occupy New York city the coup d'etat forces are experimenting with an unmanned super weapon to suppress the townspeople destroy the target areas along with a super weapon talk about massive r what is that carnival rock if what he said is true this will be dangerous what does this game have for a rating I'm so angry like windows just
[318:26.22]What is going on?
[318:27.08]My game's on the other monitor!
[318:29.31]I can't see!
[318:34.67]I can't see!
[318:35.47]Wait!
[318:46.75]No.
[318:46.83]No.
[318:47.05]No.
[318:47.23]No.
[318:47.41]No.
[318:47.57]No.
[319:23.89]What happened to my game capture?
[319:25.34]It's like all fucked up.
[319:39.98]Why can I not move this window?
[319:48.77]I'm going to do it this time.
[319:50.43]That's it.
[319:51.49]I'm done after this.
[319:52.53]You want to know how I'm going to do it?
[319:53.79]Watch this shit.
[319:54.59]Watch me.
[319:55.09]Watch how fucking stupid this is.
[319:56.63]Never mind.
[319:57.03]I'll get it.
[319:57.49]I'm just going to kill the fucking kid straight up.
[319:59.23]Watch this.
[319:59.65]I'm going to go behind him and I'm going to kill him.
[320:02.03]Watch this.
[320:13.63]if what he said is true this will be dangerous danger the mecha damage level is at a breaking point black daddy long leg gets its energy wave fire power from a power recharge facility each target area obtains powerful electromagnetic armor energy the origin of the energy supply should be cut off first Mr. president
[320:42.52]He's a meme game.
[320:45.40]They gotta remaster Demon's Souls.
[321:19.02]FromSoftware didn't make this.
[321:20.62]Oh, yeah?
[321:21.72]They did 20 years ago.
[321:23.06]I'm changing my... I'm changing my stuff here.
[321:39.27]There's nothing that's working.
[321:41.08]I have to beat this fucking spider.
[321:42.36]I'm gonna lose my mind.
[321:50.33]What do I even do about this?
[322:11.07]I have to beat this motherfucker.
[322:12.45]I have to!
[322:12.93]I'm gonna make some more money.
[322:16.70]No, no, no, this one sucks.
[322:18.72]The enemy forces apparently care.
[322:20.66]The radar, please just... Good luck, and go...
[322:37.55]Sniping?
[322:38.49]Good idea.
[322:39.89]Oh, what a great fucking idea that is.
[322:42.10]I can't wait to do that.
[322:42.92]I'm gonna... I cannot wait to grind.
[322:44.78]And... No, no, no.
[322:45.84]Why would I ever be happy about that?
[322:47.72]I'm gonna get a sniper rifle.
[322:48.78]I'm gonna shoot him from 5,000 meters away.
[322:50.20]I'm gonna win.
[322:51.04]In fact, let me just go see if that does anything.
[323:01.23]I'm gonna rage quit the game.
[323:02.37]I have to.
[323:03.03]I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.
[323:04.66]I think it's time.
[323:05.44]I'm gonna fucking go crazy.
[323:06.96]I'm done.
[323:07.78]This is a fun game.
[323:08.50]This wasn't that fun.
[323:09.94]But it was kind of fun.
[323:11.16]For a while, it was.
[323:13.24]It was.
[323:13.66]For a little while.
[323:16.45]I'm gonna try.
[323:17.01]Hold on.
[323:19.25]I just wanna see what this does.
[323:22.01]Upgrade my health?
[323:22.89]There is no health upgrade.
[323:26.05]If there is, they hit it very well.
[323:29.22]Let me see.
[323:29.66]I'm just curious.
[323:34.12]Everything's fine.
[323:35.22]I'm gonna just go.
[323:36.32]I'm gonna see what the sniper rifle does.
[323:38.84]And from there... I'm just curious.
[323:44.30]Sniper cannons.
[323:45.01]Let's upgrade it.
[323:47.55]Let's get another one.
[323:48.45]That's okay.
[323:49.19]We can just relax.
[323:50.11]No big deal.
[323:50.87]Alright.
[323:52.41]Let's just... I'm gonna use all this shit.
[324:09.88]Let's go to sniper and I'm going to make them.
[324:14.59]And I'm going to cheese this boss.
[324:15.91]Or whatever this is.
[324:23.03]That's fine.
[324:23.69]I got two sniper rifles.
[324:27.39]I'm fine.
[324:30.69]You can upgrade health, look through the menu.
[324:32.15]What do you mean?
[324:33.49]What are you talking about?
[324:37.21]Develop menu.
[324:37.89]There's only investment in manufacturing.
[324:42.34]Am I getting baited?
[324:50.75]Energy pods upgrade your health.
[324:54.31]It's not like in here.
[324:55.27]This is like background music and stuff.
[325:08.54]Be a true Jex streamer and beat this.
[325:10.32]No.
[325:11.70]Not gonna happen.
[325:14.81]Thank you, Killer Crocomire, for the 5,000 bits.
[325:16.61]50 bucks, I'm not gonna beat this game.
[325:22.11]I'd rather drink pee for a week than play the last three missions of this game, I think.
[325:27.09]Like, if you said, hey, dude, do you want to keep playing this and beat this game or drink pee for a straight week?
[325:31.11]I'd be like, I'd probably rather do that.
[325:32.31]I'm serious.
[325:46.51]What did IGN give this game?
[325:48.27]I'm curious.
[325:48.81]I want to know.
[325:49.29]I'm just curious.
[325:49.83]I just want to know.
[325:55.38]Five and a half out of ten.
[326:15.82]It really makes you feel- Alright, I'm- This is my last mission and then I'm going to bed.
[326:19.40]I'm going to bed at 7.30 like an old fucking man.
[326:31.33]Alright, equip that stupid sniper rifle.
[326:34.21]And shoot it through the spider's face.
[326:43.24]I will cheese the fuck out of this.
[326:44.64]I don't care.
[326:50.82]I will dump melted cheese all over this thing.
[326:54.22]I could care less.
[327:00.91]I'm out of here.
[327:01.81]I'm done with this game.
[327:03.29]I'm not playing it anymore.
[327:04.91]I'm done.
[327:05.35]I don't want to play.
[327:06.19]I don't want to play anymore.
[327:08.31]I'm done.
[327:08.85]This is fun for a... It was a fun game it was.
[327:28.19]Alright, that's it.
[327:43.10]I'm done.
[327:43.42]I ain't playing this anymore.
[327:47.20]I'm playing this fucking five out of... No, I'm not gonna do that.
[327:54.25]That was a fun game.
[327:55.33]It was fun.
[327:55.83]It was worth playing.
[327:56.83]It was an interesting experience.
[328:03.17]Should have just played Hearthstone.
[328:11.98]You never give up.
[328:12.78]That's what I was told when I was younger.
[328:14.40]Don't ever give up.
[328:15.98]I'm beating it right now.
[328:18.52]This is the one.
[328:20.80]Check this out.
[328:21.36]I'm going to do something different here.
[328:35.00]This is the one.
[328:35.70]I ain't gonna... I'm not gonna lose this one.
[328:37.12]Guaranteed.
[328:42.66]No sniper rifle.
[328:43.30]Get it out of here.
[328:48.33]I got the... I don't want the assault rifles.
[328:50.53]I'm gonna take this.
[329:01.96]I don't really have any better weapons.
[329:03.30]I'm so annoyed that I upgraded these to all weapons.
[329:05.70]Those things have no purpose.
[329:13.19]I'm just going to equip it.
[329:14.83]Alright.
[329:15.59]All I need is a loaded ML-14J.
[329:21.99]I'm ready.
[329:22.51]I'm going to win right now.
[329:23.69]Check this out.
[329:24.17]I ain't fucking around now.
[329:31.62]If what he said is true, this'll be dangerous.
[329:35.38]Run away for now, Mr. President.
[329:36.95]Black Daddy Longlegs gets its energy wave firepower from a power recharge facility.
[329:44.91]Each target area gains powerful electromagnetic armor energy.
[329:49.10]The origin of the energy supply should be cut out first.
[330:16.57]I know I have to take the wall out first, but I have to get there.
[330:19.91]And I might as well take this shit out in the meantime.
[330:24.29]There's like 20 fucking cubes on that wall.
[330:27.30]You can't do it on your first go.
[330:29.64]I'm trying to Jex it out here.
[330:31.48]Relax!
[330:45.92]Dang it, right.
[330:46.50]He's probably gonna follow me down here.
[330:49.12]There he comes.
[330:49.65]Alright, let's go.
[331:23.94]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[331:35.82]What is happening behind me?
[331:41.04]Oh, what?
[331:41.82]How did he get here this quick?
[331:43.70]How did he get here this quick, guys?
[331:45.72]How did he get here this quick?
[331:46.83]He wasn't even on screen.
[331:48.31]This is... How did he... How did he... It's impossible.
[331:53.40]Mr. President, please get up.
[331:55.70]If you lose in New York, won't it be the same as him?
[331:59.66]Go to the thing back.
[332:00.48]Go to the thing first.
[332:01.42]Go to the thing in the back wall first.
[332:02.62]Mr. President.
[332:03.84]Mr. President, kill the thing in the back.
[332:05.26]Mr. President, go to the thing in the back first.
[332:07.84]Okay.
[332:09.67]Mr. President, why are you not at the thing in the back first?
[332:12.03]I don't know, Judy.
[332:14.95]Can you tell me?
[332:16.27]This'll be dangerous.
[332:18.07]Run away for now, Mr. President.
[332:22.75]Yeah?
[332:24.01]The thing that everyone's been screaming at me to go to first?
[332:33.18]Cut off first.
[332:33.94]Alright.
[332:35.32]I've been screamed at, Judy, for the last, like, two hours.
[332:37.64]Are you sure you want me to do that?
[332:40.48]Judy, are you sure?
[332:41.12]I'm just gonna go there.
[332:45.17]Okay.
[332:52.28]I don't remember what spot this is.
[333:01.55]This mission.
[333:02.47]Well, they... This mission, they dialed it up so hard.
[333:06.97]It wasn't even this bad, but like the first fucking ten missions.
[333:14.10]All of a sudden, this one becomes like, oh yeah, by the way, this one's like fucking impossible.
[333:18.74]Have fun!
[333:20.04]The last one you did was, like, kind of fun, and, like, you shot stuff.
[333:23.34]Good luck.
[333:24.38]Is he already behind me?
[333:35.57]He's right there.
[333:57.16]Bad idea.
[334:03.87]Let's do it again.
[334:04.57]Just follow me all the way down here, and I'm going to turn around and go the other way.
[334:21.88]Spawning shit in.
[334:22.66]That stuff just spawned in.
[334:23.48]What was that?
[334:25.46]Nonsense.
[334:25.92]Didn't even come out of a helicopter or anything.
[334:35.35]Are you actually going to come down this way?
[334:44.48]You asshole.
[334:53.73]Come on.
[334:55.07]Just get down here.
[335:10.96]Come on.
[335:12.56]Will you walk down here or do I have to... Alright, keep going.
[335:14.74]There he goes.
[335:21.11]Keep going.
[335:23.96]Coming?
[335:24.26]Let me guess, he's going to turn around and come this way.
[335:47.28]Come on, just get over here.
[335:49.30]What the fuck?
[335:54.40]Just get over here, please.
[335:56.38]He keeps turning around to try to stop me.
[336:00.29]He's trying to... Which one of us is going to get baited first?
[336:03.07]I wonder.
[336:05.09]Yes.
[336:05.55]I know.
[336:05.89]He's going to turn around and walk that way.
[336:25.70]I wonder if I have enough time.
[336:27.24]At least get something.
[336:32.34]What are you aiming at?
[336:40.33]Why does he just aim up?
[336:41.19]He just aimed straight in the fucking air.
[336:56.31]I just bounced off that stupid guy's shield.
[337:07.38]What am I aiming at?
[337:08.46]The auto-aimer.
[337:10.80]When you shoot, it just auto-aims whatever it wants to automatically aim at.
[337:15.71]I can't control it.
[337:16.37]I just dealt with it.
[337:24.71]I have to pull him down here, huh?
[337:42.59]Okay, go on.
[337:44.05]Just follow me this way.
[337:57.02]Mm-hmm.
[337:57.71]Keep going.
[337:58.55]Mm-hmm.
[337:59.37]Mm-hmm.
[338:05.11]As someone who beat this game back when it was on the Xbox, this is the hardest and least fun mission.
[338:09.15]The final conditions are my favorite.
[338:12.84]What a great remaster.
[338:17.80]Fifteen goddamn years later.
[338:19.96]I'm gonna make this eat better.
[338:33.37]Just get rid of it!
[338:34.55]Oh my god, I hate this guy!
[338:39.61]I just want to shoot the thing behind you, but you keep, like, linebackering me every time I turn.
[338:54.32]Just keep going.
[338:55.12]I'm just gonna destroy all this stuff.
[338:56.80]I know what I'm doing.
[339:04.34]I don't know if it's gonna walk down.
[339:05.64]This one or the one behind me.
[339:12.70]Where's he at?
[339:13.42]I don't know.
[339:16.48]Not this way.
[339:23.74]Where are you?
[339:31.57]You stuck somewhere?
[339:35.27]OK.
[339:55.38]Where'd he go?
[339:56.40]Where the hell is he?
[339:58.48]Jesus, get over here.
[340:14.74]This is my opportunity.
[340:18.24]Let's go.
[340:26.85]We need to go back around this way, and there's one more, right?
[340:29.13]Yep.
[340:31.27]Okay, come on.
[340:41.30]It's right there.
[340:42.24]Just get rid of it.
[340:44.86]It's right there.
[340:45.68]It's just, like, tucked in the back.
[340:52.18]I get it.
[340:52.82]Did I?
[340:57.40]Time to die.
[340:58.74]Now you're mine.
[340:59.84]You failed Robotnik piece of shit.
[341:02.82]Robot energy- no, no energy beam now!
[341:06.66]Oh boy, you're so strong, so tough now!
[341:28.46]Not so fucking strong, are you?
[341:32.56]Oh, wow, that was so much easier when you just, he doesn't have the stupid beam.
[341:39.89]I may have overreacted.
[341:41.51]This mission, I'm just going to say I overreacted.
[341:46.71]That's why you don't give up.
[341:48.29]You call the game a 5 out of 10, like 6 times.
[341:51.74]And then you talk about how you're going to delete it, uninstall it, and refund it.
[341:55.07]And then you beat it.
[341:56.21]And then you fly.
[341:58.31]You do the last two missions.
[342:08.37]I was so angry.
[342:11.31]Remember when she said get the fuel station?
[342:13.17]I know, and I tried, but he has like this fucking detonation thing.
[342:17.49]The game's impossible.
[342:18.63]I know, I'm just saying.
[342:20.70]It was fucking... That level was dumb.
[342:25.47]I'm just gonna say, out loud.
[342:26.97]If that was a dumb level, it was a stupid level.
[342:29.89]We're just gonna agree with that.
[342:31.29]I know all of you are gonna agree.
[342:49.13]I'll tell you the best part about that was So I'm sitting here like oh fucking this games like what this level sucks.
[342:54.99]It's like game with the first game sucks I'm gonna like fucking IGN five five and a half.
[342:59.69]Hey games get five five point five out of ten It's not my fault game stupid.
[343:04.12]I Just wanted to pull out like oh, what's this game rated?
[343:06.78]Right, like pull out the what's the rating to chat?
[343:10.78]What's this game rated guys?
[343:11.72]I just what's what's it?
[343:12.60]It's not like I have it on my other monitor.
[343:14.06]I'm just curious.
[343:14.48]Can somebody say with this game traded?
[343:15.42]Oh
[343:16.69]The enemy force in the east also started withdrawing.
[343:23.87]It was the IGN one.
[343:25.43]Did they?
[343:25.93]OK, we're good.
[343:32.07]It sure has been a long road to victory.
[343:38.28]Yes, it has.
[343:44.48]That was so tilted.
[343:47.98]Fuck that spider.
[343:49.10]Fuck that level.
[343:52.44]Mr. President, when this battle is over, I'm taking a paid vacation.
[343:58.71]I haven't seen my parents for a while and you know how it is.
[344:03.87]That's fine with me.
[344:05.76]You deserve some extra time off too.
[344:11.49]Imagine someone playing Bloodborne and getting frustrated over and over and looking up the rating only to find 9s and 10s.
[344:18.51]Because then you can't, like, justify your anger.
[344:22.65]Last stop, Washington, D.C.
[344:27.80]Yes, Mr. President.
[344:30.30]The information management department just contacted me.
[344:35.58]The coup d'etat forces are making an announcement on national television.
[344:42.81]Bloodborne has a two out of 10 on some site.
[344:44.85]Does it really?
[344:47.47]Did they have a scratched up CD?
[344:51.33]This is an announcement from the government policy promotion department where the password is no more metal wolf.
[345:00.43]Metal wolf who escaped from military custody through cruel trickery continues to agitate various parts of the country.
[345:09.65]Sympathizers to these acts appear to be on the rise.
[345:14.73]As an American, this is most regrettable.
[345:19.19]Please try to remember the names and faces of any of the ringleaders who instigated this terrorism.
[345:30.90]A heart of justice is a heart that loves America.
[345:37.49]So I would never have given this game.
[345:39.23]Surrender now, while your crimes are still not so serious.
[345:44.14]But if you refuse surrender,
[345:48.00]based on article 48 clause 4 in the newly enacted u.s constitution metal wolf sympathizers and or any blood relatives removed four times or less as well as schoolmates in all educational institutions such as high schools and universities as well as any co-workers or associates
[346:11.35]For any and all related people, a public execution will be carried out.
[346:17.97]So, to any terrorist sympathizers, if an ounce of justice still remains in you, give up on that man and surrender by 5 p.m.
[346:32.16]today.
[346:34.06]This is our final ultimatum.
[346:36.78]uh but no a two out of ten this has been an announcement from the government policy promotion department where the password is we love Richard hawk a five or six out of ten is like alright this game was like made me angry and I didn't like it but you know it was still still alright it was okay if you give a game a one or two out of ten it means that you crash to dex desktop when you do double click you know what I'm saying you can't even load the game
[347:09.41]The president was alone, and the man who did it to him had come to rub salt in his wound.
[347:17.05]Oh, he hacked in.
[347:17.89]Richard!
[347:18.49]Poor Michael.
[347:20.88]Left all by your lonesome.
[347:22.64]Richard!
[347:24.76]What?
[347:28.74]What changed you?
[347:32.28]What do you rank Kane and Lynch?
[347:34.26]Probably a 4, or a 4.5.
[347:37.85]Michael, America has gotten too fat for her own good.
[347:41.15]What would I give this one?
[347:45.61]30 minutes ago, I would have given this a 5.4.
[347:48.87]These incapable pigs are eating this nation alive!
[347:55.42]the death of these freeloaders leaving only the capable behind will help me create a new nation after like getting over the that last mission I'd give this like a like a six four six point four right now oh and Michael I forgot to tell you but
[348:20.92]Your presidential staff, those backstabbing idiots.
[348:25.08]Well, I've decided they can die too.
[348:29.14]This game's a 5-7.
[348:29.88]Oh my god.
[348:31.58]You guys are fucking... You guys have... Don't push me right now.
[348:36.63]I'm very, very fragile right now.
[348:43.67]I'm very sensitive at the moment.
[348:45.29]And watch those worms wiggle in vain.
[348:47.98]Is it...
[348:49.65]I'll cry.
[348:50.87]You'll see me cry.
[348:54.63]See you when I see you.
[348:58.71]Richard!
[349:00.21]Alright, here we go.
[349:08.88]Liberty Island.
[349:10.84]I'll head to Liberty Island to rescue my men.
[349:16.10]And the reason is...
[349:19.86]Because I'm the president of this great United States of America.
[349:24.69]Yeah, what's with the dashes?
[349:26.45]Alright.
[349:30.05]Now, let me get... In here.
[349:36.82]I think I want to do... I didn't do Grand Launches at all.
[349:42.06]What a waste of money.
[349:43.50]What a meltdown purchase these were.
[349:57.20]I think I'm just going to go straight up Mr. Laundry.
[350:11.93]I think I'm going to do it.
[350:13.11]Railgun... Let me get this... I want to get down one more tier here.
[350:18.54]Is a Railgun that good?
[350:21.06]Let's see.
[350:22.40]RG-30...
[350:27.19]RG30 SP.
[350:28.27]How much do they cost?
[350:32.14]Let's do one more.
[350:35.64]RG50.
[350:36.06]Okay, let's go look at it.
[350:41.88]RG30.
[350:42.96]Firepower increases with charge.
[350:44.34]A railgun that can be charged for different projectiles.
[350:46.54]And then an advanced railgun that can be charged up to... for increased firepower.
[350:50.69]I don't have enough metal.
[350:54.15]I can make this one.
[350:57.54]But this is the default one.
[350:58.76]I don't think that'll be much.
[351:00.28]End game?
[351:00.78]Late game here?
[351:01.34]That's probably a bad idea.
[351:09.44]I'm gonna go do another level.
[351:11.50]Get some more money.
[351:17.27]Where did I make the most money that was the easiest level?
[351:21.93]Are we down here in Miami?
[351:28.14]What's a good grind level?
[351:29.94]That boat, right?
[351:31.06]Yeah.
[351:31.36]I ain't going to- I'm not going to New York.
[351:38.26]Is this the one?
[351:39.40]Alright, I got... This'll be fine.
[351:52.91]Just to do it for money anyways.
[351:56.51]Skipping the lore, we already saw it.
[351:59.61]The Navy cruiser will fire powerful long-range missiles.
[352:03.11]You'll need constant warning, Mr. President.
[352:09.47]The bomber group seems to have received a request from the target area and is on their way.
[352:14.28]The bombing will be dangerous.
[352:16.36]You should sever the reinforcements ahead of time.
[352:31.37]alright well I'm just looking for like two 300 grand a musician was among the pows you rescued he was surely forced to play the ukulele on the beach
[353:06.27]He's just grinding.
[353:07.19]That's all he's doing.
[353:08.51]Am I back here?
[353:09.21]Uh, to grind for money.
[353:23.04]Because I want to have the better stuff.
[353:42.76]There's lots of money.
[353:45.16]Offensive Hogman.
[353:54.54]Yeah, I got it.
[354:10.48]Well, their flight pattern will probably be from the direction at 12 o'clock.
[354:15.03]Oh, really?
[354:15.71]Mr. President, the fuselage damage rate is above 60%.
[354:18.77]What an evasive maneuver that was.
[354:22.49]It's about time he got serious.
[354:25.19]I have a U ammo.
[354:29.55]The missiles are airborne.
[354:30.83]Let's get it.
[354:35.19]I just want to shoot the helicopter.
[354:40.69]I'm gonna die on the grind level and that's where you say It's time for a sandwich
[355:15.25]People get sandwiches if they feel like making a sandwich in their own damn house
[355:40.81]In my house, I'm going to make a sandwich if I want one.
[355:44.29]That doesn't matter if you win or lose.
[355:46.37]You don't lose the baseball game and then, uh, no, can I have a sandwich?
[355:49.63]No.
[355:52.32]You didn't hit two home runs today.
[355:55.62]You got nothing.
[356:01.10]Team lost.
[356:05.82]All the target areas have been destroyed.
[356:08.28]Only the battle cruiser remains.
[356:10.26]Now get cracking.
[356:11.74]Oh, fuck.
[356:22.42]This is where I gotta be careful.
[356:36.01]My title makes no fucking sense anymore, does it?
[356:38.09]I haven't had, like, this stupid thing, this crazy thing.
[356:41.17]Here we go.
[356:41.43]I'm gonna try to get close enough to do this.
[356:44.50]Is it enough to take that out?
[356:54.50]No way.
[356:58.68]Don't you dare!
[356:59.79]Oh, man.
[357:00.59]I can't fucking believe it.
[357:04.13]Ugh!
[357:07.60]Insta-die.
[357:09.22]Instantly die.
[357:11.16]Attack for a sandwich.
[357:13.04]I was trying to make money.
[357:20.39]Just get over here.
[357:21.35]What the fuck?
[357:30.54]The bomber group seems to have received a request from the target area and is on their way.
[357:34.90]Yeah.
[357:35.24]Yeah, I'm sure they have.
[357:37.31]You should sever the reinforcements ahead of time.
[357:41.59]Bingo!
[357:47.23]Long range rifles are approaching.
[357:49.00]Watch out for aerial attack.
[357:50.22]Is there any way to go?
[358:15.58]In fact, if I don't do it this time, I'm just gonna go.
[358:51.32]Why are there four?
[358:53.61]Four?
[358:54.09]What is going on here?
[358:56.99]I thought there was only three.
[359:08.69]More long range missiles.
[359:10.12]These attacks will rage on unless you wipe out the launch source.
[359:48.88]What the hell, I thought I got rid of them.
[359:51.98]I just think this is so many explosions on the damn screen.
[360:04.12]Yeah, they're just little fucking toilet seat covers.
[360:24.26]Jack's excited.
[360:25.30]I wouldn't be.
[360:25.98]Not yet.
[360:26.42]Not until I show that we're gonna do something crazy.
[360:54.35]I thought he screwed seven fucking ways.
[360:56.29]Good thing I started it.
[360:57.73]One o'clock.
[360:58.37]Alright, are they done bombing?
[360:59.63]No, they don't.
[361:19.50]This guy actually sucks.
[361:22.00]This wasn't even easy.
[361:23.02]This was annoying.
[361:27.60]I can't fucking move.
[361:36.76]Oh, god.
[361:37.02]Is this hitting?
[361:37.62]I don't think it is.
[361:56.82]Mr. President, you don't want to get stunlocked and die?
[362:03.28]Do it!
[362:05.93]I can't fucking believe these things are still spinning around.
[362:52.73]They won't withdraw yet!
[362:54.91]Fire at the number 3 gun battery!
[363:05.68]Secures 1 through 5 are flooded!
[363:08.02]Repair crew, get on the scene!
[363:10.30]Do not withdraw!
[363:12.00]Fire!
[363:12.92]Fire!
[363:15.78]Alright, where do I do that?
[363:45.12]Oh, we already saw this.
[363:49.35]Alright, develop.
[363:53.47]Investment?
[363:55.33]Manufacture?
[363:55.87]Where do I do that?
[363:57.36]It said I could do it, right?
[363:58.24]It said, oh, you have enough to upgrade your suit, but where do I do that?
[364:19.08]Is it equipment?
[364:30.05]It already did it automatically, did it?
[364:34.15]Maybe, I don't know, that's weird.
[364:35.07]Alright, let's make that a real gun.
[364:44.85]RG-50.
[364:47.46]Should I make the next one?
[364:51.16]I could.
[364:52.78]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[364:53.28]I want to do... I'll do Missile Punches again.
[364:56.05]The MIM-204.
[365:01.01]Let's see it.
[365:16.01]A supreme missile launcher that fires four missiles at once.
[365:19.51]120,000.
[365:19.53]Damn.
[365:20.25]Alright, let's just try it.
[365:26.84]This is one of the last levels in the game.
[365:28.08]We're just going to go through it.
[365:28.86]Let's just put it on.
[365:34.52]What's this?
[365:35.78]One of these is a piece of crap.
[365:37.04]I think it's this one.
[365:39.26]Yeah, this thing sucks.
[365:45.95]Now it takes up two slots.
[365:50.98]I lose my Sam.
[365:52.18]What's better, this or the Sam?
[365:57.70]This thing kind of sucks too, huh?
[365:58.94]These both aren't really good.
[366:01.48]What's worse?
[366:02.02]Probably this.
[366:04.48]No, this is worse.
[366:15.09]Let's keep it.
[366:17.31]I got the railgun let's see what it does I'm ready Washington DC Mr. president why did you come to save us after we betrayed you jody I can't turn my back on a friend and the reason is I'm the president of the united states
[366:46.13]Mr. President, don't come near!
[366:48.59]It's a trap!
[366:51.87]He's still on his hind.
[366:52.93]Hey there, Michael.
[366:55.53]Are you still playing the hero?
[366:58.27]Witcher!
[367:00.47]You just don't get it, do you?
[367:02.47]Can I drop this thing like three or four times?
[367:05.40]Freedom is dead!
[367:08.76]You and your men and this symbol of freedom...
[367:17.29]Okay.
[367:17.71]Wait, we have to protect the statue?
[367:23.79]He's gonna get us!
[367:24.43]I gotta stop the missiles!
[367:25.31]Stop, stop, stop shooting!
[367:47.04]I have to get up there and protect the... It's already dead.
[367:55.21]I'm definitely missing something here.
[368:05.96]What is it?
[368:06.40]Did I just shoot him out of the sky?
[368:14.03]Damn it.
[368:14.60]I thought that would have been great if I could just kill him.
[368:18.30]I gotta kill them.
[368:24.76]I gotta shoot them.
[368:25.30]Let's do it again.
[368:36.84]Go ahead and cock your weapons.
[368:38.78]If I direct these missiles behind me, that goddess of liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens.
[368:49.27]Right.
[368:50.37]Should I be standing somewhere else?
[368:52.69]Should I just sit here and shoot them when they come out?
[368:54.85]I guess.
[369:01.46]I really should get the thing that can take it out.
[369:04.28]That interceptor one, whatever it is.
[369:14.77]It's kind of a little more awkward than it should be.
[369:16.79]Do I go all the way back?
[369:20.87]Let me see what happens to the counter when I go above the wall.
[369:44.57]Is this just, like, a DPS race?
[369:46.82]Or do I actually have to shoot all these out of the sky?
[369:48.70]Why am I not getting, like, a walk-on?
[369:52.56]Oh, there it is.
[370:12.83]round two I didn't I wasn't in the world he'll bite you if you don't move it now hightail it out of here
[370:27.46]My car door is open.
[370:28.68]I'm sorry!
[370:29.34]I almost forgot!
[370:31.56]Time for my afternoon tea!
[370:34.68]Nothing like sipping some delicious Darjeeling tea!
[370:38.42]And watching you getting your clock cleaned!
[370:41.00]Alright, we'll see you next mission.
[370:46.51]Woah, that just kinda started.
[370:48.69]Um... Same deal?
[370:51.25]Oh, jeez.
[370:54.01]He's just bombarding this thing.
[370:56.05]What the fuck?
[370:57.91]What are you supposed to do about this?
[370:59.68]Just keep... I guess, um... What's the best weapon for this?
[371:13.72]Dude... Just use the railgun?
[371:15.43]Don't I have to... charge it?
[371:21.70]Us resistance soldiers are known for our resilience.
[371:31.10]Your mecha damage rate is over 50%.
[371:33.38]Watch out.
[371:37.30]Your mecha damage rate is over 70%.
[371:41.26]I can't just stand here with this railgun.
[371:44.61]We're fine, Mr. President.
[371:51.74]We have thorough knowledge of how to escape.
[371:53.54]We're good.
[371:54.62]But our helicopters are limited.
[371:56.62]Be careful.
[371:58.38]You move too slow with this thing.
[371:59.78]Why does it shoot like a missile?
[372:06.98]Yeah, this is way too slow.
[372:09.96]I'm gonna die.
[372:11.28]I can't just stand here.
[372:14.55]I'm gonna use the rail gun and you walk away.
[372:19.05]Alright, let's go.
[372:35.30]Go ahead and cock your weapons if I direct these missiles behind me.
[372:39.73]That goddess of liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens.
[372:47.19]Give me another one.
[372:50.52]Do I have a... I need to get two assault rifles for this, I think.
[372:53.44]Unfortunately.
[372:54.72]Yeah, that's probably a better idea.
[372:57.72]I should go back to the garage.
[373:02.66]Because this is not... No.
[373:03.98]You just need the... You need the assault rifle.
[373:06.76]It's so much easier.
[373:15.92]Use the railgun now.
[373:18.16]It's too slow.
[373:28.85]Too slow.
[373:29.49]I can't... No.
[373:30.37]The railguns are not good here.
[373:31.95]Too slow.
[373:35.39]He's gonna just keep firing missiles at the Statue of Liberty.
[373:38.59]Charge it the whole way?
[373:39.81]Just shoot it at the tank.
[373:49.56]Okay.
[373:54.87]You want me to just do this, like, ten times?
[374:05.35]Is it actually going to work?
[374:06.93]No, this is not going to work.
[374:11.03]No, no, no.
[374:11.35]Too much damage to the Statue of Liberty already.
[374:13.87]Um, like, in a second.
[374:22.06]This is not going to work.
[374:26.31]This is not going to work.
[374:37.19]I'm going to get run over by this tank.
[374:39.95]Yeah, I know, we're fine.
[374:41.89]Yeah, I need to kill the launchers now.
[374:47.57]No, part one, yeah, maybe I can see that.
[375:00.77]Part two.
[375:01.33]Alright.
[375:01.81]Maybe I... Hold on a minute here.
[375:03.05]Maybe it is part two.
[375:04.15]Maybe... Okay, hold on.
[375:05.17]This might actually work.
[375:10.40]Mr. President, why'd you have to die?
[375:24.92]Go ahead and cock your weapons if I direct these missiles behind me that goddess of liberty and Your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens How much we have to load it up is it like 10 20
[375:54.68]more than that 50 alright when it flashes yellow for the first time I'll get it next time yeah restart restart
[376:19.78]Go ahead and cock your weapons.
[376:21.70]If I direct these missiles behind me.
[376:23.56]Come on, that was it.
[376:24.16]That goddess of liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens.
[376:31.60]What?
[376:34.99]This is loud.
[376:36.03]This scene that she's making me so angry.
[376:43.43]I don't think this is very effective.
[376:51.97]You have to hold it for too long, or it takes too long.
[376:55.57]I might get to the end, but I don't think it's going to work out very well.
[377:01.56]He has no more missiles.
[377:02.36]Can I take off the top ones, too?
[377:03.80]Let's see if I can get these ones, too.
[377:07.94]Am I just making him completely useless before phase two?
[377:10.16]Uh...
[377:30.13]Where's this last one?
[377:31.68]Oh, I'm over here.
[377:38.96]The game is broken, just kill him!
[377:41.66]Can I do it in time?
[377:44.30]How many bullets, how many will he shoot?
[377:46.35]How much damage does one missile do to the Statue of Liberty?
[377:50.83]Too much.
[377:53.47]No, he's gonna go phase two.
[377:56.08]Oh, fuck.
[377:56.72]Oh my god, I should have just listened to myself.
[377:58.10]I should have just shot it.
[377:59.50]I should have just done it.
[378:05.53]That'll work out though, as long as I... I can't hit it.
[378:18.20]This might not be bad.
[378:25.49]No, I know.
[378:26.45]I know.
[378:26.73]We're fine.
[378:27.39]I know.
[378:27.65]Now you're going to keep saying it.
[378:32.79]Your mecha damage rate is over 50%.
[378:42.60]Watch out.
[378:46.68]I'm looking fine.
[378:50.22]Only 200 yards between the tank and the Statue of Liberty.
[378:52.88]Kill promptly and effectively.
[378:55.60]Does that mean he's gonna get there?
[379:05.75]Stop doing cutscenes to tell me that somebody died!
[379:08.41]Because it takes away all my charge.
[379:22.49]Did you use the super?
[379:23.65]I don't have it.
[379:25.35]Alright, I gotta have a new strategy.
[379:28.40]I'm gonna have to do double assault rifle.
[379:34.22]I'll try this one final time.
[379:49.72]Because I think if I get it the right way, the way that I want.
[379:52.02]One, two, three, four.
[379:53.14]Take out the missiles up here.
[380:20.54]I'm going to stick with that strategy.
[380:21.54]I think it's going to work.
[380:29.23]Take out all the guns that I can.
[380:34.37]And then I'm going to get off the railgun and go to assault rifle and something else, maybe.
[380:38.81]I don't know.
[380:39.25]I'm not sure yet.
[380:45.28]Assault rifle and missile launcher?
[380:48.32]I wish I could have the railgun out.
[380:52.92]Let's do full charge right in the middle.
[380:56.38]Okay, here comes phase two.
[381:00.12]I have to get rid of this stupid fucking thing, of course.
[381:05.06]It's behind a small wooden railing!
[381:07.96]I want defenses!
[381:09.92]Great!
[381:14.72]Oh, fucking god.
[381:17.24]Just take the damn thing out.
[381:18.60]Okay, I'm gonna get the sand.
[381:36.53]I don't think this is working.
[381:43.74]It's actually somehow less effective than just using the Yogan.
[381:55.32]Aim for the caterpillar.
[381:56.79]Kill the leg first.
[381:58.57]That's an ironclad battle tactic.
[382:05.12]Let's see if I can make it stop.
[382:07.04]I don't even... I can't even see.
[382:09.31]I don't know.
[382:19.47]I think it... Oh my god!
[382:22.15]I'm gonna have a meltdown again.
[382:25.76]I don't think that's doing anything.
[382:28.62]The thing in the middle has to die.
[382:31.82]That's an ironclad battle tactic.
[382:39.26]I'm not sure this is going very well.
[382:42.16]I'm shooting the legs right now!
[382:47.02]Mr. President, why'd you have to die?
[383:10.41]Uh... I don't understand what to do.
[383:15.97]Yeah, I was doing much better with the railgun.
[383:17.31]Just put the railgun back on.
[383:18.49]Fuck it.
[383:20.15]I kind of want a better railgun.
[383:21.21]You know what I'm saying?
[383:22.97]How much is the next railgun?
[383:23.78]Yeah, I know.
[383:24.10]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[383:24.52]You have to laugh.
[383:53.58]It's simple.
[383:55.42]Is it?
[383:57.25]How is this simple?
[383:58.11]He's got like 30 rocket launchers.
[384:09.79]I want this thing gone.
[384:11.78]Can you not get rid of it?
[384:13.54]I'm just going to fully charge shot right in its face.
[384:16.70]Is it destroyed?
[384:18.66]It looks like it is, but it might not be.
[384:25.91]What was it called before?
[384:26.79]I don't remember.
[384:27.31]There's so much stuff going on on the screen, it's hard to tell.
[384:36.80]This thing's almost dead.
[384:37.68]I was sitting there experimenting for too long.
[384:45.44]I think it's gonna die.
[384:47.56]Yeah, it is.
[384:50.50]My, we dead.
[384:56.65]Maybe not.
[384:57.25]We'll see.
[385:01.20]God damn it.
[385:08.86]I missed.
[385:10.92]Stop!
[385:11.56]Oh my god, it's the worst.
[385:13.80]Why would you go into two cutscenes in a row?
[385:16.01]Fuck.
[385:17.33]Why?
[385:18.43]Is there ever a reason to do that?
[385:25.91]I don't even know what that did.
[385:27.21]I guess that did it.
[385:29.47]It's going slower now.
[385:57.13]Fuck off.
[385:57.67]That should have killed him.
[386:04.89]You could have just said that.
[386:07.57]You could have just told me that.
[386:11.54]I don't want to see the Hudson.
[386:26.94]I got no more!
[386:27.90]Just die!
[386:28.80]How do I get this?
[386:32.29]I gotta get rid of this thing.
[386:40.59]This thing's like a shield, or do I just have to destroy this?
[386:56.72]I'm dead.
[387:01.98]I'm dead.
[387:02.40]I'm dead.
[387:02.78]I'm dead.
[387:03.18]I'm dead.
[387:03.54]I'm dead.
[387:03.88]It's over.
[387:04.26]I'm dead.
[387:04.68]It's over.
[387:05.20]I'm dead.
[387:05.69]It's crushing everybody.
[387:06.71]It's killing me.
[387:09.03]Goodbye.
[387:19.04]Yeah, funny.
[387:20.82]How could I fall?
[387:28.44]Um, so he pushed me all the way back.
[387:29.96]Alright.
[387:30.26]Do it again.
[387:30.56]I got it.
[387:30.92]Same deal.
[387:31.34]I laugh.
[387:31.60]I want to fucking strangle this guy so bad.

[388:38.93]Stupid thing is behind me.

[388:47.45]Why would this even be possible?
[388:50.05]Like... Alright.
[388:53.60]Railgun, back out again.
[388:54.52]Come on.
[388:54.96]Gun.
[388:55.12]Railgun.
[388:57.94]Oh, fuck!
[388:58.40]He's coming fast.
[388:59.02]Alright.

[389:05.32]Got it.
[389:06.14]Other tread.

[389:13.26]Back cannons.
[389:20.20]Cutscene.
[389:20.58]Double cutscene.
[389:21.10]Double cutscene.
[389:21.56]Shoot it before the cutscene.
[389:24.26]When's the next cutscene?
[389:25.13]Coming up.
[389:25.55]Right now, right?
[389:27.82]It's ready soon!
[389:44.67]Come on, hit the lip on that fucking lid!
[389:50.49]Hit the lid!
[389:50.95]Hit the lip!
[389:51.31]Your mecha damage rate is over 50%.
[389:52.61]Watch out!
[390:00.34]Good?
[390:00.68]Now what?
[390:02.18]Now what?
[390:05.82]Just shoot it?
[390:06.70]Just kill it?
[390:12.85]More treads?
[390:16.23]Fully charged.
[390:18.61]Fully charged the tread?
[390:21.93]Oh shit!
[390:22.91]I got four more shots.
[390:44.21]Did that hit the fucking car?
[390:45.33]No.
[390:45.43]Why?
[390:45.75]Come on, I can still do it.
[390:48.95]He can't hit any other particle.
[390:51.01]Is that hurting him?
[390:53.27]I can't even tell if it's hurting him anymore.
[391:18.34]Okay, okay, okay, okay?
[391:20.26]Okay?
[391:21.10]Now what?
[391:21.44]This!
[391:21.62]Okay, kill it!
[391:22.18]Okay!
[391:22.45]Okay, kill it!
[391:22.75]What does that even mean?
[391:23.85]Why is he going so fast?
[391:26.51]What the fuck?
[391:27.41]What happened?
[391:49.72]Why?
[391:51.24]What?
[391:51.58]Why did he go so fast?
[391:59.19]That makes no sense.
[392:02.21]He went so fast.
[392:05.57]Hahaha.
[392:06.36]Hahaha.
[392:11.62]Hahaha.
[392:17.00]That was ridiculous.
[392:19.04]That was ridiculous.
[392:20.46]Un-fucking-believable.
[392:22.28]No, I gotta retry it again.
[392:23.44]Why?
[392:23.70]What?
[392:24.28]That was so unfair.
[392:29.29]That was unfair.
[392:31.07]I can't believe it.
[392:31.83]I had it too.
[392:32.41]I got it.
[392:34.68]I want to hear this again.
[392:36.56]Why?
[392:36.80]That's so bullshit.
[392:37.78]I hit this in rage time.
[392:38.56]Grind out some better railguns.
[392:41.18]Alright, I'm gonna go pee.
[392:43.70]And then we'll do that.
[392:45.75]God damn it.
[392:46.19]That's unbelievable.
[393:03.70]So I would be angry right now, but how can you be after that?
[393:09.12]You kind of can't be.
[393:15.97]I want to just give her all this shit for the next phase.
[393:19.23]If it doesn't have anything to shoot, then it doesn't matter.
[393:40.40]I would break the disk and shit on it.
[393:44.10]Oh, really?
[393:44.86]I don't... I want to just completely focus on getting to the treads.
[393:56.33]He's not gonna have any more guns.
[394:01.13]The middle one's already gone.
[394:02.21]I got it.
[394:02.49]Okay, here we go.
[394:05.63]Full blast.
[394:07.88]Into the tread.
[394:08.76]One.
[394:09.74]Two.
[394:10.74]Three.
[394:11.78]Good.
[394:12.22]Again.
[394:12.66]One.
[394:13.76]Two.
[394:15.01]Three.
[394:16.23]Four.
[394:16.43]Got it.
[394:17.19]Okay, slow down.
[394:17.67]He's done.
[394:18.51]I did it right?
[394:19.05]Did I do it?
[394:20.29]He looks like he's going faster.
[394:21.23]Okay, there we go.
[394:26.47]Okay, good.
[394:27.53]Focus.
[394:30.35]Fucker.
[394:31.27]Oh my god.
[394:31.71]What have you done?
[394:37.52]That didn't blow it up.
[394:45.63]You don't want to do it twice because it's a waste.
[394:55.11]This one might be a wash.
[395:01.41]This is it.
[395:09.69]How are you shitting me?
[395:11.37]That thing should be dead, without a doubt.
[395:12.93]Alright, bring it up.
[395:25.80]Good.
[395:26.44]Next one.
[395:36.52]Here we go.
[395:38.43]Five helicopters.
[395:39.33]Hold it longer.
[395:39.93]The bar fills up.
[395:40.45]It's full!
[395:40.77]The bar's full!
[395:41.97]The bar's full!
[395:42.75]Two more.
[396:13.84]Last shot and then it's all hell breaks loose.
[396:16.86]All hell breaks loose after this one.
[396:19.46]And then what I... Just rocket launcher?
[396:20.31]Rockets?
[396:20.47]Top rifle's not doing anything.
[396:22.13]Lock it on.
[396:22.55]Lock it on.
[396:24.11]Target lock on.
[396:24.53]Lock it on.
[396:45.84]Lock on, lock on, lock on, lock on, lock on.
[396:50.66]Lock on, lock on, lock on, lock on, lock on.
[396:51.90]I don't have any, I don't have any mother... Fuck off, who cares.
[397:05.80]Nice shooting, Mr. President.
[397:07.84]But there's many a- Your mecha damage rate is over 50%.
[397:12.08]Watch out.
[397:12.70]Here he comes!
[397:15.40]No!
[397:16.60]Mr. President.
[397:17.27]I got it!
[397:18.97]Mr. President.
[397:20.71]Why did you run?
[397:35.43]No, no.
[397:37.51]No.
[397:38.87]I can do it.
[397:39.53]I can.
[397:40.71]It's going to be fine.
[397:41.49]We're going to beat this game.
[397:43.07]It's worth it.
[397:46.57]What do you keep doing wrong?
[397:48.11]I think I don't have a strong enough weapon.
[397:54.31]This is fine.
[397:55.75]Everything's good.
[397:56.23]Don't worry.
[398:00.33]Get rid of the shitty stuff.
[398:01.39]I need to...
[398:05.55]I think I'm gonna get... I want another... I want... I'm gonna grind.
[398:09.36]This is... I'm gonna get like three of these.
[398:12.26]I think I already... I have two of those.
[398:14.92]Don't I?
[398:15.90]I do.
[398:16.12]Okay.
[398:17.32]So that's just... this is endgame.
[398:19.19]This is the endgame here.
[398:21.71]This shit is worthless.
[398:23.91]What does the most damage that's a full-on flamethrower?
[398:27.49]Maybe.
[398:29.03]It might flamethrower.
[398:29.92]Maybe.
[398:35.32]It's worth a shot.
[398:35.92]I should buy another one of these.
[398:47.38]Will the flamethrower not damage it?
[398:50.65]What do you think?
[398:51.37]What do you think?
[398:51.97]I think in, uh... Sam is still alright.
[399:07.14]I guess we'll do Missile Launcher and... Nothing but a Bazooka, that thing's terrible.
[399:13.50]We'll do these two.
[399:15.26]And Spammable.
[399:15.70]Alright, I'm gonna try this one more time with the new loadout.
[399:21.39]Same as intended for Aircraft, yeah.
[399:23.35]But I just have hams.
[399:29.23]Should I just use the other, this Bazooka, the BU?
[399:33.80]Kinda terrible.
[399:36.71]The hams do more than 600 damage.
[399:40.99]They do.
[399:42.43]This actually is better than that.
[399:45.29]This does 18... Okay, we're good.
[399:48.01]Let's try this again.
[399:48.83]I'm going for it.
[399:50.05]This time, I'm going to change up the tactic a little bit.
[399:52.55]I'm not going to use the railgun immediately.
[400:01.36]I'm going to use...
[400:03.81]No, I have to.
[400:04.39]I have to.
[400:04.85]It's so much more precise.
[400:05.69]Fuck it up already.
[400:06.45]I restarted.
[400:07.37]I fucked it up.
[400:08.13]I blew it up.
[400:08.67]I can... I just gotta get a... I gotta get a... Just one.
[400:12.67]Let's see what I'm in by this.
[400:23.33]Here we go.
[400:23.88]You have to get them each in one shot.
[400:25.76]Pfft.
[400:42.97]That's... Okay, that's... I missed, but it's alright.
[400:47.54]That's SpongeBob.
[400:49.56]That's not pitch... It's pitch shifted down SpongeBob's lap.
[400:53.59]I have to restart.
[401:03.85]Here it comes.
[401:04.39]Here it comes.
[401:05.01]SpongeBob.
[401:05.45]Alright, we're going good so far.
[401:35.63]I just have to get them each in one individual shot.
[401:42.92]There it is.
[401:44.40]Same with these ones.
[401:45.20]Same right in the front door.
[401:47.06]Statue of Liberty's going to be fine.
[401:48.90]Forget about the HP.
[401:50.30]Just worry about the mechanics involved in here.
[401:53.37]Done.
[401:54.65]Aim up a little bit.
[401:56.89]Make sure it's fully charged.
[401:57.87]It takes two to get rid of these.
[401:59.45]You know this.
[402:01.13]You know this.
[402:11.73]There we go.
[402:13.99]Okay.
[402:16.45]Cool.
[402:18.11]Just making sure that I get it.
[402:19.25]Got it.
[402:19.61]Okay.
[402:20.85]Good.
[402:21.07]Treads.
[402:21.43]Treads.
[402:22.03]And then guns.
[402:47.01]Okay, good.
[402:47.57]Done.
[402:53.75]Good.
[402:55.99]Stop!
[402:58.29]He's gonna do it again.
[402:59.43]Don't screw me over like this, please.
[403:11.88]good I'll have like I'll have like 12 shots to do this good good this is it I'm gonna shoot that thing I'm gonna shoot the I'm gonna shoot the stupid overpass
[403:38.59]Thank you for getting rid of that.
[403:40.29]Here we go.
[403:40.62]Bingo.
[403:40.92]This is it.
[403:42.44]Fully charged only.
[403:43.42]The same thing happened to me last time.
[403:44.56]I got stuck by the car.
[403:45.38]Oh, you motherfucker.
[403:51.30]Why did you do that?
[403:52.56]I can't believe it.
[404:05.11]It's okay.
[404:06.43]I still have plenty of shots.
[404:09.17]And I've got that entire... I've got the two QRSs.
[404:12.01]Come on!
[404:34.23]Come on.
[404:35.53]Come on.
[404:37.19]Come on.
[404:39.81]Let me out of this.
[404:41.49]The taxi was tiny.
[404:44.46]It's not that small.
[404:45.42]Stop laughing at that.
[404:53.84]Seven shot.
[404:57.00]He'll be out of moves soon.
[404:58.87]Oh, no.
[404:59.79]Is this too slow?
[405:04.24]I got two QRSs.
[405:05.22]50 yards.
[405:05.37]Here we go.
[405:06.15]Come on.
[405:32.16]No!
[405:32.42]How did I do less damage than last time?
[405:36.58]Here we go!
[405:39.92]Get him!
[405:40.18]Oh fuck!
[405:40.52]He's dead!
[405:40.92]One more!
[405:41.29]Shoot it!
[406:02.82]I lost.
[406:03.32]I should have stuck with the plan.
[406:11.80]I should have stuck with the plan.
[406:13.68]I should have stuck with the plan.
[406:15.00]Guys, I should have stuck with the plan.
[406:17.00]New tactic.
[406:31.14]New tactic!
[406:57.92]Better tactic?
[406:58.88]It's better.
[406:59.94]What a better tactic this really is.
[407:04.62]Now I got enough energy supplies.
[407:06.56]And now I have more and I'm just gonna stick to the fucking plan.
[407:19.05]I will have like 20 shots.
[407:23.69]Is this thing destroyed?
[407:30.93]It is now.
[407:31.33]Oh, fuck.
[407:33.15]Oh, that's not good.
[407:33.73]Okay, this is very bad, actually.
[407:35.03]This is horrible.
[407:37.39]Worst plan confirmed.
[407:46.22]He's already on the move.
[407:47.30]Yeah, he's already moving.
[407:49.04]This is worse.
[407:49.42]This is way worse.
[408:03.01]Wait, is the Statue... What if the Statue of Liberty just can take the hits right now?
[408:07.99]Hold on.
[408:08.15]I think the Statue of Liberty is fine.
[408:21.96]Going straight in the middle.
[408:32.90]so come on
[408:56.93]Yeah, forget about the top missiles and shit.
[408:59.59]I think I can do it right now.
[409:00.65]He just put up a shield for me.
[409:01.69]That's fine, I'll take it.
[409:02.50]200 yards though, man.
[409:04.14]You're already here.
[409:06.48]That's an ironclad battle tactic.
[409:31.23]Come on.
[409:34.99]Just stick.
[409:35.59]I can stick to the plan.
[409:38.40]I have 100 meters.
[409:39.74]Come on.
[409:41.82]Your mega damage rate is over 70%.
[409:45.20]Be careful.
[409:50.81]That's actually so funny.
[409:54.75]I just need to shoot it like five times.
[409:57.33]I'm already home.
[409:57.89]I so close to being dead Thorns
[410:23.96]Just restarted.
[410:24.90]Oh my god, I just didn't... I keep taking missiles.
[410:31.49]I have to walk to shoot the... Okay.
[410:34.24]I got it.
[410:37.22]Same thing, just gonna do... Old plan.
[410:41.95]Old plan.
[410:42.39]Only old plan.
[410:43.13]The same thing I did before, and I have to do it quick this time.
[410:47.79]The missiles do too much damage.
[410:51.87]They're too annoying.
[410:52.89]Clean it up.
[410:54.29]Grab me, buddy!
[410:58.65]Yeah!
[410:59.95]I couldn't... I try... I can't take my hand off the controller.
[411:09.03]I was trying to do the thing where you put your finger up to your throat and you shake it around.
[411:13.83]Wasted.
[411:18.85]You got fucked, baby.
[411:20.39]I am beyond... I am beyond angry at that.
[411:24.06]That's two shots that didn't take it down.
[411:28.02]Okay, get rid of the rest of the missiles.
[411:36.84]That shit literally is almost dead.
[411:40.20]That Statue of Liberty is almost dead!
[411:42.10]Good thing I still hit something.
[411:45.10]It is almost dead.
[411:46.54]Am I not gonna do this?
[412:09.99]Oh, fuck.
[412:10.65]This is bad.
[412:18.04]This is my last attempt before I go grind another grown-up.
[412:20.58]How... What did I... Why was it already over?
[412:26.12]Go ahead and cock your weapons!
[412:28.04]If I direct these missiles behind me, that goddess of liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens!
[412:37.99]I hate this game.
[412:44.51]Literally with the fucking rocket coming out and I hate this game.
[413:14.58]the company that made this game no you don't I bet you don't you definitely don't I can assure you you played something that you were like sick yes I do no you don't do you you might FromSoftware games are for everybody
[413:43.34]What if I just start shooting at it now?
[413:45.66]Well, it's not moving.
[413:55.95]Yes, I do.
[413:57.05]Yes, I do.
[414:06.68]Fucking tread.
[414:11.58]This game's too stressful.
[414:13.51]I apparently didn't hit the tread either.
[414:15.85]On that one.
[414:18.85]Show me where I missed.
[414:20.81]I need to know where it was.
[414:22.21]How did that... It's not even... That is impossible to not hit that.
[414:25.17]I hit it there.
[414:26.33]Boom.
[414:28.09]I'm fucking... I'm... It's over for me.
[414:31.86]I'm fucking like... I'm tapped out right now.
[414:37.94]It's out.
[415:03.42]Your mecha damage rate is over 50%.
[415:04.72]Watch out!
[415:08.32]Stupid ass level.
[415:10.89]I need a better weapon.
[415:12.73]And it's still there.
[415:14.41]It's still there.
[415:16.53]It's still shooting.
[415:17.75]I missed.
[415:39.10]It's not even possible to miss!
[415:41.30]Do you fucking understand?
[415:43.88]The crosshair was sitting... It's not even possible to miss that shot.
[415:49.32]It was lined up.
[415:50.58]It just went under the thing.
[415:52.04]It's not even possible.
[415:53.80]Oh!
[416:05.41]Go ahead and cock your weapons.
[416:07.35]If I direct these missiles behind me, that goddess of liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens.
[416:17.35]If I don't do it this time, I got to get a better weapon.
[416:21.76]Otherwise, this is just never going to happen.
[416:45.79]Okay.
[416:46.92]Get this one too!
[416:49.70]Aim at it!
[416:50.34]It's aiming!
[416:50.82]I'm gonna fucking scream!
[416:54.64]I'm gonna scream!
[416:55.38]I'm gonna scream!
[416:59.48]No!
[417:01.98]Okay, I go.
[417:11.41]I need money.
[417:12.33]I need money.
[417:13.47]I need money.
[417:14.15]I need money.
[417:17.54]Oh, I hate this game.
[417:19.62]But I can't stop playing it.
[417:22.76]I'm not only... I'm not halfway through the game.
[417:25.20]No way.
[417:25.46]There's like two more missions.
[417:36.17]No, this is a... This is a... This is like an 8 out of 10 game in like a 4 out of 10 games body.
[417:45.80]That's my theory on this.
[417:57.21]I'm doing the boat again.
[418:09.60]It's time for the boat.
[418:10.32]No, I'm not alright with this.
[418:25.66]The boat didn't get me enough money?
[418:37.37]How much should I do for... No, this actually might not be bad here.
[418:41.15]I'm gonna stick with this.
[418:42.29]This is THE loadout.
[418:44.85]I'm good.
[418:45.17]Let's go.
[418:53.62]Check this shit out.
[418:54.76]I don't know what to pick.
[418:56.02]Itchy eyes.
[418:56.40]Alright, don't even hold that down for that long.
[419:25.17]Okay.
[419:25.51]No.
[419:25.71]Keep going.
[419:26.14]Keep going.
[419:26.58]Forget it.
[419:32.06]Just take out the targets.
[419:33.52]This is a target destroyer.
[419:34.84]Use missiles?
[419:38.68]No.
[419:38.92]No.
[419:39.20]You don't even need to.
[419:40.77]Forget it.
[419:41.65]Mm-hmm.
[420:02.69]Here they come.
[420:03.63]Alright, watch out.
[420:04.13]Just watch it.
[420:04.85]Here they come.
[420:06.31]Where are they?
[420:06.69]I don't see them.
[420:08.05]You lied.
[420:09.11]You lied.
[420:10.98]You lied.
[420:12.48]They're not here.
[420:15.88]Where are you?
[420:17.72]Watch this one.
[420:18.62]Eat shit.
[420:22.63]Did I get it?
[420:25.21]Why is this taking so much damage?
[420:42.48]Let's go.
[420:43.92]Almost done.
[420:47.55]Going head to head with this kind of firepower isn't the smart way.
[420:51.47]Firepower?
[420:51.89]Start by crushing the gun battery.
[420:55.49]The defense strength is high against live ammunition.
[421:06.30]That goes.
[421:06.95]Alright.
[421:07.35]One more.
[421:07.97]No more.
[421:13.43]Shoot after the third yellow.
[421:19.39]One, two, two, three.
[421:24.51]After the third yellow.
[421:25.83]This is where I come in here.
[421:29.03]And I drop the absolute fucking nuke over here.
[421:33.40]Watch out.
[421:33.90]Alright, get in there.
[421:34.82]Close.
[421:37.08]Thing is in the way.
[421:38.82]Here we go.
[421:40.82]And... Go!
[421:48.98]The long-range missiles from that Navy cruiser are on a collision force.
[421:52.94]Please do not be caught off guard.
[421:59.34]One.
[422:00.80]Two.
[422:01.86]Third yellow.
[422:02.45]Go!
[422:03.77]Nice.
[422:08.05]Get this turret over here.
[422:09.49]One yellow.
[422:11.05]Two yellow.
[422:12.59]And here comes the third yellow.
[422:19.73]One yellow.
[422:20.83]Two yellow.
[422:22.33]Incoming third yellow.
[422:24.63]Yellow activated.
[422:30.39]Say it with me now.
[422:31.32]One yellow.
[422:32.54]Two yellow.
[422:33.76]Activating the third yellow.
[422:39.00]I guess I missed him.
[422:48.36]Excuse me?
[422:49.81]Too far away?
[422:50.59]What the fuck's happening?
[423:09.15]Who cares?
[423:09.63]Just stand still.
[423:17.03]How is he so good at video games?
[423:18.37]Lots of practice.
[423:19.51]Lots of practice.
[423:20.89]Okay, I will.
[423:48.67]How much money is it?
[423:49.57]And I'm just gonna do it again.
[423:50.61]That was loud.
[423:57.90]C, E, D, E. I didn't get any points.
[424:02.88]Oh, that's not a lot of money at all, actually.
[424:07.11]That's really, really bad.
[424:16.43]Which one had more money than that?
[424:22.83]Maybe I can get a combo.
[424:30.66]Do the New York level?
[424:36.28]No, I just almost ripped my mouth because I'm playing this, but hold on.
[424:51.35]There is a way to do this.
[424:52.25]I'm going to do Assault Rifles.
[424:53.27]I'm going to ski around and just get a ton of multipliers.
[424:58.79]Don't worry about me.
[424:59.51]I'll be fine.
[425:04.17]I did not want to select that.
[425:05.14]What a broke-ass game.
[425:14.60]There we go.
[425:14.88]Alright, I'm good.
[425:22.30]This one will be easy because I know where to go, I know what to do.
[425:27.94]Let's get that assault rifle, assault rifle, and string it together.
[425:31.37]I'm just trying to get points and string together money and...
[425:52.96]Destruction damage bonuses and all that shit.
[425:55.61]Whatever that does.
[426:06.79]Imagine leaving the screen like an hour and a half ago and coming back and being like, holy shit, he's lost his goddamn mind.
[426:13.48]And I can't believe he's still here.
[426:16.82]Like, hey dude, you don't have to do this.
[426:20.67]You don't have to do this.
[426:21.53]It's alright.
[426:22.25]You don't have to... Just don't... Stop playing this level.
[426:33.44]You don't have to be here.
[426:37.14]Those U-type weapons self-destruct when they draw near.
[426:40.30]Don't give it the right of way.
[426:42.06]Destroy it before it gets any closer.
[426:55.79]Alright now we're gonna go straight back We can bring up the other you know what I'm saying Where is the spider
[427:26.13]I need eyes on the spider.
[427:27.57]I think I got eyes.
[427:42.85]How much does it take?
[427:43.43]One?
[427:44.89]Not very much.
[427:45.39]Doesn't take a whole lot.
[427:47.43]Oh shit!
[427:48.49]He's right there.
[427:50.15]I got eyes.
[427:50.53]I got a collateral?
[428:21.32]It's cool.
[428:21.92]It's cold.
[428:22.40]I'm touching it.
[428:23.36]It's cold.
[428:23.74]Stop.
[428:32.09]Is he?
[428:40.73]Fighter?
[428:41.21]I'm not sure.
[428:48.03]Let's push the door.
[428:59.09]Back over to the wall of power-ups Watch out for that spider he'll get you he's gonna come get you Of course he's still there
[429:22.65]Of course he's still here.
[429:24.69]Why would he not be here?
[429:25.75]Can I snipe it from all the way back here?
[429:27.31]Come on.
[429:28.07]Nope.
[429:38.86]Get over here.
[429:44.54]Be careful.
[429:45.26]He's charging up his laser.
[429:48.20]Watch out for the laser.
[429:52.40]Why is he going that way?
[430:21.90]His brain is just all over the place right now.
[430:28.48]Here he comes.
[430:29.53]Finally.
[430:31.89]To me.
[430:33.97]To me.
[430:34.33]I know you can do it.
[430:41.57]Okay, here it goes.
[430:41.97]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[430:42.95]Keep going this way.
[430:43.97]You buffoon.
[430:45.88]You buffoon.
[430:50.18]He just doesn't know what to do.
[431:31.52]How do I get rid of ants?
[431:35.00]It's actually kind of easy.
[431:36.66]So you take a little bit of water and put sugar in the water, like four or five tablespoons, and shake it up.
[431:44.42]Really dilute the sugar in the water.
[431:48.66]And then go around the baseboards of your house and drip that sugar water all over your baseboards and under your couch.
[431:57.27]And maybe a little bit under your bed.
[432:00.07]In the bed.
[432:02.56]That'll probably get rid of him in probably a couple days.
[432:19.47]Yes.
[432:19.89]Yes, don't do that.
[432:23.77]You guys are fucked.
[432:26.16]OK, can he please come over?
[432:31.98]He won't come over here.
[432:33.76]That's it.
[432:35.28]I've had enough.
[432:35.92]I'm going to him.
[432:37.38]I've had enough.
[432:38.20]I've had enough.
[432:38.78]Get over here.
[432:40.16]I've had enough.
[432:41.24]It's time for you to crawl over here.
[432:42.76]Find me.
[432:45.24]Over here.
[432:46.06]Good.
[432:46.64]You're doing great.
[432:47.28]Keep going.
[432:51.03]Good.
[432:51.61]Alright.
[432:51.95]Here comes the charge.
[432:53.65]Not quite yet.
[432:54.29]Here he comes.
[432:54.71]He's going to charge up.
[432:55.51]He's going to one hit kill me and I'm going to BRB and go to the bathroom.
[432:59.67]This is it.
[433:02.38]He's turning around again!
[433:03.44]He's just gonna kill him.
[433:24.60]I'm gonna kill him because he's so stupid.
[433:27.48]I'm gonna kill him!
[433:30.24]He has no way to go.
[433:32.24]I'm gonna win.
[433:33.12]He's so stupid.
[433:33.62]I'm gonna hit him right in the back and it's gonna kill him.
[433:37.76]This is gonna work.
[433:42.52]Watch this.
[433:42.86]Ready?
[433:43.16]Come on.
[433:43.78]Get up there with the boost.
[433:47.80]Right in the back.
[433:54.30]I can't believe it went over his shoulder.
[433:56.00]That's un-fucking-believable.
[433:58.42]You almost can't miss that shot.
[434:02.07]Oh, God.
[434:02.69]Here we go.
[434:03.45]This is complicated.
[434:06.04]I just wish it wouldn't sit down.
[434:16.32]This wouldn't even have to happen.
[434:22.31]I'm gonna lose.
[434:22.73]Here it comes.
[434:23.33]It's over.
[434:23.95]I'm- I- I just said, I gotta- I gotta go.
[434:26.13]If you don't want to see heaven in person, you'd better rock, Mr. President.
[434:33.64]The fuselage damage rate is over 70%, Mr. President.
[434:37.32]I'm sure you're just overworked, but are you okay?
[434:57.83]Oh, no, please!
[434:59.87]Please, no!
[435:02.39]No, don't do it!
[435:04.59]Don't do it!
[435:15.05]Just go again.
[435:18.61]Okay.
[435:20.55]Alright, I made it.
[435:22.09]Watch out for the mines.
[435:29.94]Why am I getting hurt?
[435:31.28]Which psycho trolled him into playing this?
[435:33.42]Me.
[435:33.56]I'm the guy that trolled myself into playing this.
[435:35.44]I did this.
[435:36.06]Nobody else did this.
[435:37.00]Don't worry.
[435:37.48]Oh, I was going to pick that up.
[436:26.24]blink twice.
[436:29.88]Jerma, blink twice if you don't want to play this anymore and you really don't want to be alive anymore playing this.
[436:52.15]He's right here, please!
[436:54.13]No!
[436:55.57]Why does he have to do this to me?
[436:57.01]Hey Trevor, blink twice if you have a little bit of a...
[437:27.50]I wish I could just pull him down here, but he keeps turning around.
[437:38.29]It's almost like the... What is this?
[437:42.41]What is that supposed to be?
[437:43.89]What is that?
[437:48.85]Right?
[437:49.21]Like, why did you get over here?
[437:51.07]Why is this happening in this level?
[437:57.38]What is happening here?
[438:06.95]I have to do this.
[438:07.61]I have to go closer, apparently.
[438:09.69]I'm just trying to get him to turn around.
[438:21.14]Just push past him?
[438:26.68]I don't have enough health to do that.
[438:28.18]I gotta go this way.
[438:31.58]Now I should be able to make it run.
[438:39.51]And then I can go this way.
[438:41.17]Where is he now?
[438:44.61]Alright.
[438:45.83]Maybe he'll get stuck over here now.
[438:49.97]And I've already beaten this shit.
[438:51.55]No, he's already back.
[438:52.15]Here he is.
[438:52.69]Yes, he's here.
[438:53.78]I have to just get through him.
[438:54.72]I have to get through him.
[438:55.44]We have to dash him right now.
[438:56.76]Go.
[438:58.42]Hug the corner.
[439:07.09]Mr. President, please get up.
[439:09.35]If you lose in New York, won't it be the same as him broadcasting those phony news stories?
[439:15.91]Why would I play this level?
[439:18.41]Why would I play this one?
[439:20.88]This is the worst mission out of any game in the last 30 years.
[439:25.10]Why would I do that one?
[439:30.92]That's worse than the Donkey Kong Mine level.
[439:34.38]Why would I do that?
[439:39.69]Just go over here.
[439:43.61]Annihilate the enemy army by destroying the target areas where the troops have amassed.
[440:02.38]Destroy all the target areas.
[440:03.76]Give me some big chains.
[440:05.04]And take back the town.
[440:28.17]You need someone to come take the game away.
[440:30.72]No, I need to beat this game so I can say I was one of the sorry motherfuckers that decided to beat it.
[440:51.93]I want, like, shit bragging rights.
[440:53.85]Oh, yeah?
[440:54.35]Hey.
[440:54.69]Oh, well, that doesn't matter.
[440:56.76]Who cares?
[440:57.46]I'll be at, like, TwitchCon next month.
[440:58.82]Talking to people and...
[441:16.73]What'd you stream, like, last month?
[441:18.57]Anything cool?
[441:19.21]Well, yeah, I mean, like, I beat Metal Wolf Panic.
[441:24.50]You know that game?
[441:29.16]You know that one?
[441:29.72]You fly around with a mech and there's a fucking spider level and it's worse than Donkey Kong Mine.
[441:35.20]Yeah, I know that game.
[441:37.46]I didn't buy it.
[441:38.00]Because I didn't think it was going to be good.
[441:39.38]Why did you play that all the way through?
[441:41.49]You know, because I flex in front of them.
[441:43.49]Yeah, as long as I did it.
[441:44.91]Okay.
[441:45.13]Why do you think I care about this?
[441:53.54]I played Minecraft and, like, built a house and was really, like, calm.
[441:59.35]How many bits you get on that stream?
[442:01.17]I don't know.
[442:01.65]I didn't keep count.
[442:03.06]How many?
[442:03.44]Let's look.
[442:03.78]I don't think we should do that.
[442:14.60]On my stream, I was playing Fortnite.
[442:16.44]I got, you know, fucking 65 million bits.
[442:18.96]How much did you get?
[442:19.90]I don't know.
[442:20.70]I don't do that.
[442:22.16]And now they fucking slam my drink as fast as I can and then fucking walk away.
[442:26.73]...when communications are made, large numbers of reinforcements join the battle.
[442:31.07]It's really a nuisance, so destroy it first.
[442:48.79]Mr. President, target areas still remain.
[442:51.73]I know they do.
[442:52.73]OK.
[442:52.99]Ow, my head.
[442:59.93]Does that hurt my head in real life?
[443:04.85]Why won't you shoot me?
[443:16.62]Hey, what's up?
[443:17.46]Hey, what's going on?
[443:18.10]Hey, how are you doing?
[443:18.96]It's good to see you again.
[443:20.06]Streamer XYZ, whatever.
[443:23.70]Hey, how are you doing?
[443:25.42]I heard something about you.
[443:27.04]Yeah, what did you hear?
[443:28.38]I heard that you had a meltdown playing that game that nobody really... I don't know why you care so much about it.
[443:34.90]Are you playing that full metal Wolf Panic game?
[443:37.80]Yeah, I was playing it earlier.
[443:40.91]I heard you got 5,000 unsubscriptions to your channel.
[443:43.91]You alright?
[443:44.59]I gotta go!
[443:53.43]What's even left?
[443:54.91]Oh, so much.
[444:29.29]A thousand dollars.
[444:30.37]No, that's not that much.
[444:31.37]A hundred dollars from Vilemi.
[444:32.66]They say, fuck you, Jeremiah.
[444:33.82]I love Metal Wolf Chaos.
[444:36.96]I'd like it, too.
[444:39.12]So you and I both, we can, like, go to TwitchCon.
[444:41.58]We can, like, be like, fuck, get it.
[444:47.59]Fucking stop it.
[444:49.17]I just want to, okay, Energy Con.
[444:55.69]No, thank you, the group.
[444:57.54]It's a lot of fucking money.
[444:59.99]100 bucks is a lot of cash.
[445:02.65]I'm shocked that anyone would give it to me.
[445:05.00]Almost done here.
[445:05.68]Just gotta go up here, and then we can do the next railgun, and then I can beat the game.
[445:19.48]And then at the end of the night, at the end of that, you know, hey, what's going on?
[445:22.52]Hey, the turbo!
[445:23.60]Get over here, man!
[445:24.76]I've had like 10 slam-chugged nervous chugs, right?
[445:29.06]Jerma, oh, you gotta see this guy, man.
[445:30.96]Like, all my cool friends on Twitch.
[445:32.84]Get over here.
[445:33.24]Look, dude, this guy can chug like you've never seen before.
[445:36.04]It's ridiculous.
[445:36.76]Every time I have a conversation with him, he just slams out.
[445:38.54]It's crazy.
[445:39.30]He's so fast.
[445:40.52]Hey, dude, Jerma, can you chug?
[445:42.60]And I'm just like, what are you talking about?
[445:45.33]No, I don't know.
[445:47.89]Chug, chug.
[445:48.75]Okay, okay.
[445:49.85]Chug, chug.
[445:50.51]Okay, I'll try it.
[445:51.65]I can't.
[445:53.93]and fucking puke all over the ground all over the fucking table and it's incredibly embarrassing I have to go home oh what the fuck disgusting disgusting what the fuck Jeremy thought you were cool man I thought you could chug

[448:44.07]And then I get up and fuck with you.
[448:46.73]And just play the bot on a projector.
[448:56.55]The enemy forces have you surfed a building making it a target the building was opened two years ago on April I'm just taking
[449:12.58]It's fun.
[449:13.22]Why would I still be playing this way today?
[449:15.68]And go.
[449:17.06]No, this game is fun.
[449:19.46]It really is.
[449:20.66]I'm just bitching.
[449:41.55]Except for the spider.
[449:42.21]That really is the worst thing.
[449:45.51]Why are you British?
[449:47.34]It's an easy way to say that you're messing around.
[449:49.08]You're just taking the piss, right?
[449:51.04]That's like an easy way.
[450:04.81]How much did I get paid to play this game?
[450:10.93]I don't know what that number would be.
[450:15.73]I don't know.
[450:17.11]It would be probably $60,000 to $75,000.
[450:22.42]I forgot about this.
[450:23.38]I forgot about the tank.
[450:26.16]Oh my goodness.
[450:27.30]I forgot about the tank.
[450:28.64]I forgot there's a boss in this.
[450:32.05]I don't think I'm going to be able to do this.
[450:35.03]What do I need here?
[450:36.15]Okay, I need... I need... I'm just going to do a slowdown.
[450:37.76]I just need the money.
[450:55.62]God, this thing does a lot of damage.
[450:57.42]I'll be alright.
[450:58.30]What the fuck are you doing?
[451:00.49]That just went over my head, thank god.
[451:02.43]I can't fucking move.
[451:08.45]Don't blow it.
[451:09.31]Please, seriously.
[451:10.61]Charge it up.
[451:32.86]Easy, the cannon.
[451:36.54]He didn't shoot the cannon?!
[451:40.22]Alright, give me the new blow gun.
[452:06.12]Alright.
[452:07.54]Hey, why is this mission not ending?
[452:17.13]Alright, so now that we've settled down, we're able to relax and just continue playing the game.
[452:24.54]Thanks, everybody, for joining me on the stream.
[452:34.05]Hope you had a good time.
[452:34.85]Hope you're having fun tonight.
[452:36.79]I know I am.
[452:47.22]It's been fun.
[452:48.68]Is that enough to give me some money?
[452:52.24]A ranking.
[452:53.84]Zero damage points.
[452:54.74]I didn't do any damage, I guess.
[452:56.94]Not enough damage.
[452:59.65]140,000.
[452:59.89]Alright, that's enough for another raven.
[453:07.06]Remember I said I was going to start pulling streams back so they wouldn't go that late?
[453:11.53]Sure went out the fucking window, didn't it?
[453:15.55]Alright.
[453:19.53]Develop.
[453:21.31]I think I need more.
[453:22.35]Investment.
[453:23.95]I'm going to need more.
[453:31.64]RG50 SP.
[453:31.92]That's not even an upgrade.
[453:33.94]That's just like a side grade upgrade.
[453:37.92]Shit.
[453:51.15]How much does it cost?
[454:00.24]Additional projectiles.
[454:01.32]How much is it?
[454:01.76]65 plus... Okay, I need 65,000.
[454:04.36]I'm just going to go to the first mission, level 1 here.
[454:14.97]I don't even know what mission level 1 is.
[454:17.94]This one here.
[454:19.44]Yeah, this is fine.
[454:25.43]Just go.
[454:30.13]Get out, my special ops suit.
[454:34.47]I thought he was going to rage, but a while ago.
[454:38.29]Yeah, he was.
[454:38.79]But he fought through it.
[455:04.72]He fought the demon in his mind.
[455:07.92]He decided it was worth playing through and doing it, beating the game, and he's going to beat this game monster.
[455:15.00]However long this takes, by the way.
[455:18.13]Oh, wait, I should have said that.
[455:19.85]What if the game is like only 10% up?
[455:21.09]Okay, if the next two or three missions are not the final missions, then the game's over.
[455:34.32]Let's shoot the statue, it doesn't work.
[455:46.05]Enemy shield's down!
[455:51.89]Mr. President, the Eagle Star is beyond here.
[455:54.59]Get going before the enemy chases after you.
[455:57.14]Proceed ahead while destroying anything that stands in your way.
[456:00.54]Switching over your weapons, depending on the situation, is the main speed of fighting.
[456:04.92]Try out the weapons in your backpack as you like.
[456:07.14]Is there anything in this energy pod?
[456:16.92]I found another energy pod.
[456:24.65]I just found a weapon
[456:44.23]LaFranda, 50 bucks from LaFranda.
[456:46.91]Thank you so much for the 50 dollars.
[456:49.35]And what do you say?
[456:50.01]You say, dude, you're barely finished with this game.
[456:53.54]Bro, you have to conquer Europe, then fight Russian bots, then hack into China.
[456:58.42]I don't think that's what I have to do.
[457:00.02]But if it is, then I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[457:03.34]Mr. President, there's an aircraft hangar beyond this passageway.
[457:06.98]Now let's hurry.
[457:08.05]The aircraft hangar is behind the barrier.
[457:10.11]I'll open the barrier now.
[457:11.91]Please wait a moment.
[457:18.23]Let's hope that projectile weapon is enough.
[457:21.75]End this nonsense.
[457:25.82]Stream tomorrow?
[457:26.58]Yeah, tomorrow is going to be wild.
[457:28.70]Who thought this one was all over the place?
[457:31.44]Just wait until tomorrow.
[457:33.14]Tomorrow's a wine stream, guys.
[457:34.32]I'm going to be drinking tomorrow.
[457:35.77]I'm going to have fun tomorrow.
[457:55.93]Is that it?
[457:58.71]Terraria?
[457:59.10]No, Terraria is going to be Sunday.
[458:02.52]I already talked to Starbuck.
[458:03.50]Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. President.
[458:05.64]The barrier has been opened.
[458:07.02]Air Force One's launch preparations will be complete soon.
[458:12.98]Please tell me I'm going to get at least 20,000 for this.
[458:16.70]Well, I guess they won't be voting for you next term.
[458:20.03]Mr. President, the enemy is taking aim at Air Force One.
[458:23.67]Please be careful.
[458:28.62]Well, they're all gone.
[458:29.78]I'm trying to do the snipe once.
[459:09.43]Offensive argument.
[459:10.25]Alright, let's go.
[459:10.95]That's it.
[459:13.27]Give me 20,000 and then I can finally get to the end of this next mission.
[459:16.17]With a love of goodness.
[459:22.67]There we go.
[459:23.31]Damage points.
[459:23.91]167.
[459:23.93]167 thousand dollars?
[459:24.65]Oh, yeah.
[459:24.88]Loaded in there.
[459:25.42]Wait.
[459:25.54]That was it.
[459:25.82]HK69.
[459:25.90]Is that enough?
[459:44.26]I'll head to Liberty Island to rescue my men.
[459:47.37]And the... Because I'm... What is the age of 79?
[459:56.41]Grenade?
[459:56.76]It's a grout.
[459:57.20]It's a grenade launcher.
[459:57.96]Alright.
[460:01.56]Well, let me develop.
[460:02.14]Let's see if I can get it.
[460:03.42]69,000.
[460:03.76]I wish I could just sell something.
[460:09.49]Railguns.
[460:10.07]There it is.
[460:10.61]Now I can do it.
[460:14.04]There it is.
[460:14.76]RG50 SP.
[460:16.50]An advanced railgun that can be charged up for additional projectiles.
[460:20.99]Give it to me, please.
[460:23.47]Time.
[460:24.15]It's... This is... I know we're getting late.
[460:25.91]And I said I wasn't going to do late streams anymore.
[460:29.43]But here we go.
[460:39.26]There it is.
[460:39.62]Let's see if I can do it now.
[460:48.59]This is longer than the two streams I said that I was gonna do last week.
[460:52.37]Let me see what this does.
[460:53.25]Slower.
[460:53.41]Much slower.
[460:54.45]What does it do, though?
[460:55.57]I mean, it's kind of ridiculous.
[460:57.21]I'm gonna stand back and see what happens when I shoot.
[460:59.60]I might be able to take out a whole row here.
[461:02.06]Kind of.
[461:02.24]That's good.
[461:18.99]I'm gonna keep doing it.
[461:22.89]Going right down the middle.
[461:28.35]Oh, fuck.
[461:28.87]That does too much damage.
[461:30.71]Maybe it doesn't matter.
[461:31.43]Maybe it doesn't matter.
[461:31.99]Maybe I can still do it.
[461:41.46]Too much damage.
[461:41.92]I'm gonna have to use the second.
[461:46.58]Okay, now I take, I can, hold on.
[461:48.20]We're good.
[461:48.90]Wait, hold on a second.
[461:49.42]I'm gonna have to get the whole back row here.
[461:55.39]This is never gonna work with this low, slow charge.
[461:59.43]I need to get rid of all this stuff first.
[462:02.92]Yeah, no way.
[462:07.44]This is impossible without getting rid of everything first.
[462:18.50]yeah we're gonna do the original railgun in phase one this one in phase two
[462:42.22]go ahead and cock your weapons if I direct these missiles behind me that goddess of liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens I don't understand like that was seriously why would you take that much that would that that that's unbelievable
[463:18.93]I'm just gonna stand up here.
[463:30.48]Can I jump on the tank?
[463:31.54]I'm not sure I want to do that.
[463:37.56]Oh boy!
[463:38.74]I may have done something wrong.
[463:52.33]What the fuck happened?
[463:53.93]Why did he start moving?
[463:58.69]Why did he start moving?
[464:01.02]Is it the amount of damage you do?
[464:02.46]Fuck this.
[464:03.40]Check this out.
[464:04.04]What if I just don't care and just shoot the tank?
[464:07.62]Who cares?
[464:22.57]Will he kill the Statue of Liberty?
[464:26.80]In time?
[464:27.24]I don't know.
[464:27.76]Maybe.
[464:28.04]I'm gonna try to take out this whole back row.
[464:49.39]Anyone?
[464:49.65]I was trying to split him.
[464:54.34]Statue of Liberty's dead.
[465:08.71]Oh my goodness.
[465:11.45]I'm gonna lose my damn mind playing this game.
[465:13.27]I mean, I already did, but like, holy shit.
[465:18.75]Maybe I should just start to... Maybe I should just try to catch... Let me try this.
[465:27.86]Go ahead and cock your weapons.
[465:29.80]If I direct these missiles behind me, that goddess of liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens.
[465:42.71]Alright.
[465:43.01]Alright.
[465:43.29]Hold on.
[465:47.28]Right down the middle.
[465:51.94]Get rid of the beam.
[465:56.10]Okay, now the... Hold on.
[466:04.21]I did that really quickly.
[466:05.55]I might have some time here.
[466:27.10]That was a genuine fuck.
[466:28.96]That was a genuine, like, heads- like, sneeze forward fuck.
[466:37.34]My head went back forward.
[466:39.77]Hard.
[466:44.39]Okay, I'm good.
[466:48.77]Not bad.
[466:49.39]It might- this might work.
[466:55.13]Switch out to the big one.
[466:56.30]After, hold on.
[467:02.74]This is it.
[467:06.10]Right here.
[467:07.38]I can get both.
[467:11.22]You stupid motherfucking cutscene.
[467:15.16]Why does that have to even happen?
[467:17.02]Oh my god.
[467:18.32]This game is gonna drive me fucking up the wall.
[467:28.89]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[467:31.71]This is, this is just, this is just, you can't say this is not dumb.
[467:35.67]This is dumb.
[467:36.71]With a capital D. It's just dumb.
[467:48.17]How does a fucking almost full charge shot take that off?
[467:51.55]Not take that off.
[467:54.54]there's no explanation this is worse this gun is worse I spent the time grinding to get this and it's not even as good I just popped my elbow that's how you know it's real
[468:21.79]That was a good start, too.
[468:23.31]That's so sad.
[468:24.23]I'm gonna have to do this again.
[468:26.63]I'm just gonna use the original railgun.
[469:08.70]Didn't destroy it.
[469:16.39]I'm back to his original one.
[469:22.35]Machine guns.
[469:23.69]I'm gonna go for the top.
[469:30.00]Okay, I gotta get rid of these things.
[469:37.17]Tread has to go now.
[469:38.83]Like, right now.
[469:39.49]Watch out, watch out.
[469:40.12]Please let me shoot it.
[469:46.82]It's a cutscene!
[469:50.16]I got it.
[469:50.42]Okay.
[469:52.44]Let's go.
[469:56.20]Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[470:12.89]I'm just going for the tank.
[470:15.47]I'm just going for it.
[470:32.01]That's a lot.
[470:32.93]That is a lot.
[470:34.47]Just so we're clear.
[470:35.11]That's a ton of fucking damage.
[470:41.84]Only 200 yards between the tank and the Statue of Liberty.
[470:44.48]We're taking too much damage though.
[470:45.56]Kill promptly and effectively.
[470:47.56]That's an ironclad battle tactic.
[470:50.04]Is it going faster?
[470:58.19]I can't even get... Dude, the dialog is being cut off.
[471:08.24]I seriously Mr.. President, how could you let us down?
[471:26.66]I wonder if I should just get good things instead your weapons if I direct these missiles behind me that gun
[471:34.29]This shit ain't working.
[471:36.69]Maybe I should hold on to this and use this for the missiles.
[471:53.30]I'm doing that.
[471:56.83]Yeah, I'm gonna try that.
[472:04.31]Just buy a bunch of the missile launcher.
[472:17.82]I think I could probably take out the ones in the back quickly with that other launcher.
[472:24.10]It's possible.
[472:27.85]Let's go with the cannon in the middle.
[472:35.78]Alright, let's try to get the machine gun here, and then I'm gonna try to get the Mrs. Moot back.
[472:48.33]Wait, no, I mean the treads first.
[472:49.49]Treads first.
[472:50.15]Treads are more important.
[472:58.38]I just didn't even do the thing I said I was gonna do.
[473:01.48]Lost my fucking mind.
[473:21.86]I don't think this is physically possible for me to beat this without different weapons.
[473:25.18]Without getting the perfect storm.
[473:26.96]I think I have to grind.
[473:30.16]This shit ain't working.
[473:33.65]Go ahead and cock your weapons.
[473:35.59]If I direct these missiles behind me, that goddess of liberty and your cute little secretary will all be blown to smithereens.
[473:45.55]Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
[474:02.82]I wish I could stand back further to blow this up.
[474:12.27]Did I get it?
[474:25.36]I don't know if I got it.
[474:32.72]I think I got it.
[474:35.85]Is it going faster?
[474:36.65]I can't tell.
[474:59.82]Your mecha damage rate is over 50%.
[475:01.20]Yeah, I know.
[475:02.40]I know it is.
[475:03.24]I know it is.
[475:06.60]No, I can't... Only 200 yards between the...
[475:28.80]I'm going to try that again.
[475:29.62]No, no, no.
[475:30.58]I don't know what to do.
[475:40.22]I think... I think I just kind of have to go... stay up there and shoot the missiles?
[475:49.50]I was so close to the railgun and rockets.
[475:51.86]Yeah, it's so hard to replicate, though.
[475:53.48]It's just so... You gotta be... It's not even being perfect.
[475:57.45]You just have to be in... It's like the timing is weird.
[476:13.15]I had it almost twice, but then, for some reason, with no treads, this game decides that it's going to go 100 miles per hour with the last, like, 20 meters.
[476:21.74]For no reason.
[476:22.96]It's just gonna do it.
[476:24.42]I don't know why.
[476:31.88]Once we get the cutscenes, I think I have to change.
[476:33.60]It's just screwing everything up.
[476:35.61]It's ruining everything.
[476:44.99]That's your liberty zone today.
[476:50.75]And that didn't hit.
[476:51.51]Three railguns didn't hit.
[476:54.07]Three hit.
[476:54.55]Direct.
[476:55.05]Three fucking direct hit with, like, almost halfway charge.
[476:58.15]It's inconsistent.
[476:59.15]What the fuck?
[477:02.55]What is that?
[477:08.05]What else do I have here?
[477:27.63]I can't use this because this gets cut-scened.
[477:29.59]So it's just not gonna work.
[477:32.38]They give you a cut-scene every single time somebody gets hurt.
[477:35.40]So... I guess we're gonna go with... We're gonna get rid of this.
[477:44.52]And... The bazookas?
[477:56.59]Sam, maybe?
[477:59.14]Double bazooka?
[477:59.83]I wanted it.
[478:00.85]Should be sand bazooka.
[478:04.59]I don't... I need a better one.
[478:06.21]Alright, let's try this now.
[478:12.84]I'm just gonna check the other ones.
[478:19.52]What about this?
[478:20.12]I can't even... How much damage does this do?
[478:24.71]Missiles and bazooka are the key.
[478:25.99]Alright.
[478:32.73]I guess I'm gonna do the SAM, and... Just these two.
[478:38.55]Let's see which ones are more effective.
[478:40.03]I guess I'll keep the railgun.
[478:42.75]Just for shits.
[478:51.16]I'm just trying to try to target everything, I guess.
[478:53.08]Just target them individually.
[478:56.12]Keep the railgun for maybe the end?
[478:58.12]I'll try it, whatever.
[478:58.86]Let's see.
[479:05.65]I don't have these.
[479:08.57]These don't work on your cute little secretary.
[479:10.63]We'll all be blown to smithereens.
[479:11.61]Okay.
[479:44.84]Why was I using the other thing?
[479:47.31]Why was I using the railguns?
[479:50.09]Why was I using the railgun?
[479:53.21]Why was I doing that?
[479:58.11]I don't know.
[479:58.65]People told me to... Didn't people tell me to do that?
[480:01.09]Weren't people telling me?
[480:05.13]People were telling me, right?
[480:06.71]People were telling me to do that.
[480:08.49]Was it two people?
[480:09.33]It was not two people.
[480:10.11]It was like 6,000.
[480:10.45]Whatever.
[480:21.02]You guys told me to go back and grind for the railgun!
[480:24.87]Tears are streaming down my face!
[480:39.37]It was a shitload of people.
[480:40.83]That was a lot of people that told me to do that.
[480:43.97]And I believed you.
[480:45.53]Because I thought it was for real too.
[480:46.69]I just killed that thing so easily.
[480:50.71]Just by using bazooka.
[480:56.77]I apologize for saying he was real good.
[480:58.38]I don't know anything about the game.
[481:03.38]Mr. President, my boys were successful in saving your princess.
[481:08.15]I'll connect you Mr. president how can I ever jody yes sorry to be late
[481:22.34]Mr. President, I was individually targeting each piece of the thing.
[481:27.53]I was individually targeting each piece of that tank.
[481:40.97]Did you witness Vice President Richard Hawks dreadful... Oh, it's a mystery.
[481:46.09]Who is he?
[481:47.72]As I have been stressing all along... Who could it be?
[481:50.76]Metal Wolf was the truly righteous one.
[481:55.32]While the world may have doubted you, I always believed in you.
[482:00.24]Thank you, Metal Wolf.
[482:01.92]And thank you, Michael Wilson.
[482:05.47]Whatever...
[482:26.38]Did I get enough money?
[482:27.36]Did I get some money?
[482:28.62]Give me some money.
[482:30.12]No, no, no, no, no.
[482:30.96]I mean like in the game, not you guys.
[482:32.77]Where's my money?
[482:34.79]No.
[482:36.79]That's a lot of money.
[482:50.69]That's $439,000.
[482:50.89]I can't believe it.
[482:57.97]But I am... I was individually targeting pieces of the guy's fucking legs and arms and stuff.
[483:04.65]What the hell was I thinking?
[483:07.71]Why was I doing that?
[483:13.60]Look at his hair.
[483:14.12]Like a volcano is erupting from the fucking front of my head.
[483:20.66]There's no fixing that hair.
[483:21.64]I'm just gonna buzz it.
[483:26.60]Hey, see you on the next mission.
[483:30.85]Zip cam?
[483:31.21]I don't have any zips today.
[483:35.41]Where there a zip?
[483:36.67]No, there's no zips today.
[483:44.70]Just grind this level 50 times.
[484:05.39]Hey.
[484:06.86]Hey, guys.
[484:07.58]Oh, yeah.
[484:07.86]I think I showed you this before.
[484:08.90]This is making it real easy, too.
[484:11.38]Oh, Razor.
[484:13.43]Look at the Razor Death Adder.
[484:16.85]Sticky shit over here, and things just fall off of it.
[484:39.03]Yeah, it's sticky.
[484:39.75]It's like a grip.
[484:40.45]It's like put on with like fucking masking tape.
[484:50.74]That was the day I realized the pen is not truly mightier than the sword.
[484:55.54]Why would I ever buy a razor death at it?
[484:56.84]Because I have like these big fucking gross hands.
[485:01.26]Look at how big these hands are.
[485:03.60]They're huge.
[485:05.16]Like, people don't realize, like, I have gigantic fucking oven mitt hands.
[485:12.97]When I grab a mouse, it's like... Ow!
[485:26.35]That was so fucking loud!
[485:28.06]Why was that so loud?! !
[485:34.10]That was loud in this room, too.
[485:36.36]It was like the perfect... I told you, I've got these fucking earthquake hands.
[485:57.67]Holy shit.
[485:58.57]Hey, LaCranda, thanks for the $50.
[486:00.43]Use Railgun with a funny, funny face.
[486:03.74]Thanks for the $50, 5,000 bits.
[486:04.97]It's a shitload of money.
[486:06.71]Thank you.
[486:08.11]Vilemi, $50.
[486:09.47]Jeremy, I don't have much more money to give you, but since you said to give you more money, here you go.
[486:13.47]PS Chat, did you know that the guy can chug?
[486:33.73]Yeah!
[486:45.15]These things are great.
[486:45.87]I'm not... Who cares?
[486:47.45]Ocean spray.
[486:48.25]Ocean spray's good.
[486:49.53]They're delicious.
[486:50.15]They're small.
[486:50.75]They're easy to handle.
[486:52.00]They're easy to drink.
[486:58.08]Air Force One had been cleared of any wrongdoing.
[486:59.84]Now there are sights for once again firmly set on the White House.
[487:04.16]I told you I got these big watches.
[487:05.43]I'm not even gonna try.
[487:06.15]This is a regular sized can.
[487:12.49]Don't you understand?
[487:18.23]I can almost go around the whole thing.
[487:24.64]Can you do that with a can of Coke?
[487:25.94]I can.
[487:28.94]Crush it.
[487:39.55]Alright, Mr. McDonald said something.
[487:44.57]Mr. President, I... Jody.
[487:50.47]Yes, what is it, Mr. President?
[487:53.44]You sure you don't need any more time off?
[487:58.84]Oh, yes, Mr. President.
[488:00.62]I've had enough.
[488:04.08]T.O.S.
[488:04.50]T.O.S.
[488:05.84]Now time to take back the last piece of ground.
[488:10.77]Of course.
[488:11.77]You know where that is.
[488:17.29]The White House.
[488:18.73]Alright.
[488:20.77]So, we are... It looks like there's a lot more video game here.
[488:25.93]Retake the White House.
[488:26.93]I don't think so.
[488:27.47]Maybe not.
[488:29.88]But first, I am going to do that again.
[488:35.50]Which was it?
[488:35.98]It was this one here.
[488:38.60]I'll head to Liberty.
[488:39.56]And because...
[488:42.47]Just go.
[488:43.05]I'm gonna do this like two different times.
[488:52.91]Go ahead and cock your weapons.
[488:54.88]If I direct these missiles behind me, that goddess of liberty and your cute little secretary will...
[489:14.00]Going fast still!
[489:15.48]Take out Treads, please!
[489:26.66]Yes, yes, yes, I know.
[489:45.38]Nice shooting, Mr. President.
[489:47.43]But, there's... Holy shit, S. Okay, that's fucking... Alright, do it again.
[490:05.19]I know, I know.
[490:05.90]Look, after seeing me do this now... Imagine being a VOD watcher and seeing that last hour and a half.
[490:15.08]And knowing that you could skip to that.
[490:24.81]Those of you watching the VOD right now...
[490:27.73]Just, I'm sorry.
[490:29.07]I'm sorry that you had to watch that for, like, 40 straight minutes.
[490:36.26]But, like, there's, like, 2,700 people.
[490:38.52]Like, 400 people told me to use the railgun and to, like, grind to get the railgun.
[490:42.50]So I listened.
[490:43.90]It was, it was.
[490:44.66]It was, like, 400 or 500 people.
[490:45.92]It was a lot of people.
[490:50.32]And I thought that you were giving me tactical information.
[491:07.58]Or I was just pretending the whole time.
[491:10.07]He was the particular one that killed him.
[491:21.06]That's so bad, knowing how easy this level is.
[491:24.52]Can you imagine, not only, forget about the people that are watching the VOD right now, can you imagine the people who are watching the stream right now, who have played through this game and know that, and were lost in the sea of Get Railgun.
[491:36.76]And they know how easy this was.
[491:54.26]Imagine watching this live.
[491:57.42]Hey, thanks for sticking around.
[491:59.21]This is a long one.
[492:01.31]First 10-hour stream in a while, probably.
[492:05.01]And I am absolutely happy to have it mostly 95% of it be this game.
[492:11.63]What a journey it's been.
[492:12.75]It's been fucking wild.
[492:14.83]You've heard me say, like, fuck.
[492:16.87]You've heard me say, like, shit.
[492:19.96]I've heard me go, this is ridiculous!
[492:21.82]This game is fucking crazy!
[492:23.76]You've heard that a few times.
[492:24.92]We've got a few things here.
[492:33.99]Nice shooting, Mr. President.
[492:44.76]But there's many a slip between the cup and the lip.
[492:57.22]Whatever.
[493:00.22]What's happening?
[493:03.24]Wait, this is... Oh yeah, no, I won.
[493:05.36]First thing I thought it was... Alright, we win.
[493:08.94]What happened there?
[493:09.86]Alright, that's it.
[493:13.06]I got plenty of money.
[493:16.44]It's time to get the best railgun.
[493:21.08]No, no, no, I don't want to skip this shit.
[493:22.60]We don't know what this is.
[493:23.98]The enemy seems to be concentrating their power around the White House.
[493:27.86]An overwhelming number of defense forces, unlike any yet seen, are predicted to be on hand.
[493:33.72]The shape of this underground base is highly complicated.
[493:37.16]There is a strong possibility that the target area is closely coordinated.
[493:41.40]Skillfully attack to prevent reinforcements and coordination between target areas.
[493:47.57]The granddaddy battle of them all.
[493:49.49]And have the White House.
[493:50.33]The call name... TAKE THE WHITE HOUSE!
[493:51.59]I'm home.
[493:52.05]Good luck and... Goddamnit.
[493:52.87]Alright, here we go.
[493:53.39]Investment.
[494:13.76]Level 6 Missile Launcher.
[494:15.02]I want it.
[494:16.60]Boom.
[494:17.62]MIM-204LR is now available.
[494:27.34]That was a longhorn.
[494:32.16]Missile Launcher 7.
[494:34.76]The MORH is now available for purchase.
[494:38.40]Oh yeah.
[494:39.30]Railguns.
[494:39.82]Get it.
[494:45.99]The RG50 DMB is now available.
[494:48.89]Keep going.
[494:50.57]The RG70 is now available.
[494:53.97]The RGRH is now available.
[495:03.52]Bazookas.
[495:05.02]Get this shit too.
[495:05.80]I'll just blow the tank up two more times.
[495:08.28]M2PR.
[495:10.98]M2EX.
[495:16.73]The TWBZ.
[495:17.59]Yeah, I'll just go get the- I'm gonna go blow up the tank.
[495:29.06]I'll head to end, because I-
[495:42.45]Go ahead and cock your weapons.
[495:44.41]If I direct these missiles behind me, that goddess of liberty and your cute little second... This is like silent.
[495:57.07]I don't know how long we've been here, but it's really, really bad.
[496:04.64]Was this a meltdown stream?
[496:06.34]This was.
[496:06.82]No, it was.
[496:08.02]It's been a while.
[496:08.58]When was the last, like, true, just absolute fucking meltdown stream?
[496:11.72]I don't know.
[496:12.16]I'm not sure.
[496:17.40]He'll be out of moves soon.
[496:22.18]PSVR?
[496:24.65]Stuntman Iceland.
[496:27.62]Oh, right.
[496:29.10]But before that.
[496:30.34]It's like been three days.
[496:34.14]I gotta, like, settle down.
[496:37.20]The Mountain Blade stream.
[496:38.28]The difference between Mountain Blade, though, is I straight up gave up.
[496:41.16]And I didn't even attempt to keep going.
[496:45.24]I'll do it one more time.
[496:50.89]That should get us to where we want to be.
[497:02.71]Hotline Miami.
[497:03.54]At that... Hotline Miami was true, actual upset.
[497:08.76]Like, truly angry.
[497:10.48]Truly upset.
[497:13.48]That's one of the first times I think I've ever really, truly been upset on camera.
[497:17.93]Actually, today, too.
[497:19.25]And Escape 3 and Arizona.
[497:21.83]No, whatever.
[497:23.89]Mario Maker?
[497:24.47]Yeah, no, you're right.
[497:25.41]Mario Maker 2.
[497:25.87]That didn't happen.
[497:30.07]Do I regret playing Hotline Miami?
[497:31.93]No, I think it's a great game.
[497:33.57]Hotline Miami 2 is awesome, and Hotline Miami.
[497:35.35]I think Hotline Miami is better than Hotline Miami 2.
[497:38.57]I think it's just a better game overall.
[497:49.89]Falk Tower?
[497:50.49]I think Falk Tower was more of a complete, just total determination stream.
[497:55.87]Not really a meltdown.
[497:57.14]I just wanted to beat it.
[498:03.05]You didn't like the coin game?
[498:04.87]I thought I'd love that game.
[498:11.68]Alright, let's buy things that I just upgraded.
[498:16.26]The coin game was awesome.
[498:17.80]That's like one of my favorite games of the year.
[498:21.66]What's... it's clock tower.
[498:27.23]Alright, I think I can do one more row here.
[498:32.68]Railguns all the way, yep.
[498:35.02]Bazookas all the way.
[498:38.58]PR is here, and the final bazooka.
[498:41.59]The TWBZRH.
[498:45.35]Let's see what that does.
[498:52.03]Alright.
[498:56.55]Wait, what?
[498:57.87]How is there another one?
[498:59.26]The VP's go-to bazooka, double-barreled and capable of repeating fire.
[499:03.66]Uh, yeah, I'll take one of those.
[499:04.74]What about the railgun?
[499:11.55]Missile launchers, what's the best one here?
[499:14.49]MLRH, the VP's go-to missile that fires missiles that split.
[499:17.83]I don't have any more material.
[499:23.76]Well, it's going to have to be that bazooka.
[499:25.96]I need more material.
[499:26.68]Repeating Fire Railgun.
[499:28.88]I might as well make the other cheaper.
[499:32.52]Can I make the cheaper ones?
[499:35.48]No.
[499:36.00]I can do this one.
[499:38.65]Rifter Bombs?
[499:39.33]I'll take it.
[499:40.61]I might as well take... Can I take... No.
[499:50.38]No, that's good.
[499:50.86]Let's go back.
[499:57.00]Here it is.
[499:57.32]And on the other side, we'll do... What do I want to do on the other side?
[500:08.19]I guess I could put that there.
[500:14.17]I'll just put the other railgun here.
[500:15.27]Good to go.
[500:18.05]It's the best missile launcher in the game.
[500:20.01]In the whole game.
[500:32.58]final mission it's been a journey let's party it's good to be home
[501:07.12]This thing is ridiculous.
[501:08.44]I'm not even gonna use it.
[501:09.12]I'm gonna save it.
[501:12.67]What's this, uh, what's the comp do?
[501:13.91]You got it.
[501:15.65]What?
[501:34.03]It just shoots a balloon.
[501:38.03]This dude sucks.
[501:44.98]I don't want to be using that anymore, actually.
[502:04.03]there's a bomb in here jeez let's try the jump one more time just getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger so just launch it it's a giant beach ball that's not very good
[502:37.63]No, it's fine.
[502:43.98]Even at full charge.
[502:44.92]It won't even get rid of one of these little towers.
[502:50.57]Awful.
[503:07.70]Rare.
[503:09.46]I don't like this loadout.
[503:11.53]I need a machine gun or something.
[503:13.55]I don't like it.
[503:15.13]I'm not the biggest fan of this loadout.
[503:17.65]Sorry, guys.
[503:21.52]You know what's going to make somebody mad?
[503:30.88]Me.
[503:36.11]If I can grind the tank some more.
[503:38.33]I'm not sure I'll need to.
[503:48.62]I'll give you five bucks for fighting the tank with that railgun.
[504:06.87]Those metals.
[504:08.09]Good!
[504:10.82]Good, good, good.
[504:13.68]I don't know about this one.
[504:35.95]What are you going for?

[506:39.28]It's a really nice place.
[506:40.90]I love the... I miss Toronto.

[507:09.54]It's like bar, if you like think like barbecue, that's a great place to go.
[507:24.08]Game's too long.
[507:27.74]Fixed it.
[507:34.37]I said that when you think barbecue, you really want to be there.
[507:38.17]It's got some of the best barbecue places in the country.
[507:46.69]I'm too quiet?
[507:47.39]What did I do?
[508:02.24]All the way through here, and then... It's not too quiet now.
[508:05.50]I've got it.
[508:10.50]How do I get up from here?
[508:18.55]Is that possible?
[508:21.25]I've got to go in a different tunnel, I guess.
[508:36.58]I don't know what that was.
[508:37.90]Oh, a bomb.
[508:40.42]Why did I blow the other one up?
[508:41.56]Why would I do that?
[508:42.38]I don't understand.
[508:46.26]Oh, yeah.

[509:34.24]Destroy it!
[510:02.82]Mr. president the poisonous gas has been stopped completely due to the target areas being eliminated the enemy surrendered at long last did I actually do it well they surrendered why are they still attacking
[510:40.33]What's next?
[510:40.75]Leave a level?
[510:42.45]Cure a path.

[512:07.16]I don't want to blow this.
[512:08.60]God damn it.
[512:08.90]I have to do all that again if I lose.
[512:11.52]And this is a bad loadout.
[512:13.46]This is a terrible loadout.
[512:29.86]I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do about this.
[512:31.92]I'm at beach ball.
[512:32.62]What was that?
[512:33.08]Tongue twister!
[512:59.82]Okay, this is open.

[514:30.99]There we go.
[514:31.69]Thank you.
[514:36.16]This is bullshit.
[514:37.26]The White House is right there, Mr. President!
[514:40.92]Mr. President!
[514:47.59]Well, this will give me a good opportunity to get rid of literally the $800,000 beach ball ray gun that doesn't do anything.
[515:13.95]I'm going to kill the tank like three more times.
[515:38.09]Playing Diablo 3, do you hear this?
[516:13.67]Bastion sucks.
[516:14.63]I'm leaning back in my chair.
[516:40.62]I think that's enough, I think.
[516:49.44]Manufacture... Bazookas!
[516:57.11]So this is the thing that I currently own, right?
[517:00.39]I still have enough metal!
[517:01.39]That sucks.
[517:06.68]Rare metal required.
[517:09.70]Unbelievable.
[517:10.82]I'm gonna piss my pants.
[517:14.68]I gotta go pee.
[517:16.36]I have to.
[517:16.83]I'll be right back.
[519:35.53]For the love of God.
[519:40.27]Usually when I come back from peeing, I'm like, yeah, I feel better.
[519:44.81]What is this rare metal dog shit?
[519:47.05]Like, what is the point of this?
[519:54.04]It's just money.
[519:54.66]It's just like a number.
[520:15.37]Alright, I am going to... I don't know.
[520:19.46]I need to think of something.
[520:21.68]I bought everything I can buy.
[520:22.62]Get the Gatling gun.
[520:27.88]How far down?
[520:28.40]Where's that?
[520:28.78]I'm going to machine gun.
[520:45.96]1, 1, 3.
[520:46.52]1, 1, 3, 4.
[520:47.00]Well, I don't have enough to get it.
[520:54.03]Looks like it's gonna be a better loadout.
[520:59.05]I'll try this again.
[521:00.85]I'm only gonna seriously give this, like, another couple attempts.
[521:03.35]I can't stream for, like, 10, 11 hours.
[521:08.03]I can't.
[521:08.51]My brain will fucking melt.
[521:09.77]Uh, I'm gonna stick with this.
[521:14.33]Get rid of this thing.
[521:20.60]I need some assault rifles, because... Alright.
[521:26.29]What are you doing?
[522:27.91]What am I doing?
[522:28.49]The game would not let me select this item.
[522:31.53]It was glitching out and making it impossible to click.
[522:35.50]So I had to do it manually with the keyboard.
[522:49.46]I'm not sure this is going to be very effective here.
[522:53.82]Maybe I'll just run around with a flamethrower and just hold it down.
[522:57.31]This would be better.
[522:58.01]I think this is alright.
[523:05.16]Get the gatling gun?
[523:05.96]Let's see.
[523:14.15]No, no.
[523:14.55]Manufacture.
[523:20.49]The VP's go-to machine gun fires multiple powerful rounds.
[523:22.81]I need $22,000 worth of metal.
[523:30.22]Now, getting rid of the beach ball gun and two machine guns should help a lot.
[523:34.60]I'm gonna go for it.
[523:36.78]Let's go.
[523:37.46]I gotta go.
[523:38.62]I gotta get out of here.
[523:40.16]I'm streaming tomorrow, and tomorrow's gonna be like an intense stream, too.
[523:43.22]So why the fuck am I streaming for ten hours today?
[523:46.73]Tomorrow's gonna be all over the place.
[523:54.35]Yeah, we're gonna start the regular time tomorrow probably closer to four You forced yourself to beat this I know and I'm upset about it
[524:27.95]Did he actually get in?
[524:28.79]He got in.
[524:55.81]Put on the regular machine gun.
[525:06.80]I'll take this thing.
[525:08.26]I actually got this one.
[525:23.25]We're doing Just Dance tomorrow?
[525:24.47]No, we're doing You're In The Movies.
[525:34.18]It's the gas one.
[525:41.69]Here it comes.
[525:48.57]Yes, it's me speaking please who is it?
[525:51.11]Alright, that's it now we go straight down
[526:18.09]I have to take out the helicopters.
[526:21.69]Those are the things that cause so many problems.
[526:23.37]Why can I not walk on them?
[526:29.17]God mind this whole thing.
[526:37.11]Alright, let's go.
[526:45.49]I gotta pick up some shields.
[526:48.16]I'm gonna need them so badly in the next part.
[527:22.25]Am I muted?
[527:34.25]I need shields. Please drop a shield for me.
[527:39.25]For me.
[527:41.25]Did I get one?
[527:50.25]Really?
[527:57.27]Ammo, I need shields.
[528:07.78]This whole thing is blanking out.
[528:09.96]I don't even know if I'm still streaming.
[528:16.10]I am, right?
[528:17.12]Yes.
[528:31.18]You're a pre-recorded chat.
[528:33.89]Well, at least you're here.
[528:54.77]More bombs.
[528:55.65]I can't detonate these on my own.
[528:57.71]I guess I can, but you have to really be precise with them.
[529:12.61]Oh, I remember this part.
[529:14.33]It sucks.
[529:18.98]Mr. President, you are experiencing radar trouble.
[529:22.42]You can't move carelessly about until the radar jamming station is destroyed.
[529:28.73]Will you marry me?
[529:44.07]No.
[529:59.75]Says you work, I think I'm doing a good job What what is what's about it that's cold how is that cold Target area
[530:27.40]These are bombs everywhere, isn't it?
[530:29.56]Thankfully I was not downstairs.
[530:37.41]I'm gonna do it, guys.
[530:45.47]I'm gonna do it!
[530:46.49]I'm gonna do it this turn.
[530:48.52]And there's gonna be celebrations.
[531:12.84]I would marry Jerma and then divorce him so I get half of what he gets every stream.
[531:29.60]Now I know your mind.
[531:43.20]That's not... And you guys are calling me cold.
[531:49.52]It's me cold.
[531:52.04]Alright, I'm good.
[531:55.44]It's time.
[531:56.85]I'm ready.
[531:57.91]Let's get... I got full health bar.
[532:00.79]I'm going for... What do you think?
[532:04.29]Super launcher?
[532:06.15]And just a standard faithful here.
[532:16.19]I'm not using the real gun.
[532:36.32]How are you guys still alive?
[532:48.96]Three arms, ammo, good.
[532:56.70]Okay.
[532:59.33]Here we go, I gotta get rid of this.
[533:03.09]I need something that can lock on, though.
[533:05.11]So, I think I'm gonna have to stick with this.
[533:07.65]I need something to lock on to those helicopters.
[533:13.67]This is it.
[533:14.07]This is the one.
[533:16.18]I am going to do it right here, right now.
[533:18.55]It's time to... It's time to... What's this?
[533:22.41]Mr. President, peel off that unsightly armored exterior.
[533:33.75]A scaredy-cat missile is being protected in a sturdy shelter.
[533:36.87]When the shelter opens, that's your chance to attack.
[533:54.79]We good?
[533:56.25]Let's get rid of all the bullshit out all over the place over here.
[534:11.02]No!
[534:46.29]Coming along nicely.
[534:47.91]You're halfway there.
[534:50.57]We're halfway there.
[534:54.91]No, leave it on the ground.
[534:59.11]Take my hand and make it, I swear.
[535:05.74]No, leave it on the ground.
[535:12.88]You ready?
[535:18.24]You're such a boomer, I will divorce you.
[535:22.92]Right?
[535:29.32]What?
[535:29.88]Was I not supposed to do this?
[535:33.22]What happened?
[535:33.98]Was I not supposed to do that?
[535:36.36]What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened?
[535:43.00]I destroyed the White House?
[536:14.38]But why?
[536:15.28]I can't shoot it?
[536:18.08]I just... I was doing fine.
[536:21.83]I was doing fine there.
[536:23.41]I really was.
[536:24.25]I had to... I can't hit the White House.
[536:30.65]You can only destroy the armor.
[536:40.61]Why do you think it had a health bar?
[536:41.93]Because I thought I had to...
[536:44.47]I don't know.
[536:45.02]I didn't think I was gonna kill the whole thing.
[536:47.78]Oh, fuck.
[537:02.69]Um, I can't, I was so close.
[537:04.80]I didn't know that, though.
[537:19.11]Hold on.
[537:22.17]Hold on.
[537:22.63]I'm gonna do it.
[537:23.62]I'll be fine.
[537:24.22]So, in Canada, there was a saying growing up.
[537:38.11]My mother, who's French.
[537:41.01]I think you guys have it in English, too.
[537:45.77]I think it's in English.
[537:52.90]Which my mother told me that translated to, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.
[538:01.81]It's a little saying we have here in Canada.
[538:19.26]The above now get out there and rock their world.
[538:32.19]I'm gonna beat this.
[538:34.15]I'm gonna beat this and it's gonna be the end of my channel because after I beat it, I'm gonna be so exhausted that on stream they're gonna have to take a real backseat.
[538:50.29]I'm going to have to go to the spa after this.
[538:54.55]I will beat this.
[539:01.00]Can't beat this.
[539:03.10]I will beat this.
[539:04.30]We just crossed the 10 hour mark.
[539:06.28]I was going to give up.
[539:07.82]Remember I was like raging.
[539:09.34]I just gave like a 5.
[539:12.72]What did Ajin give this?
[539:14.52]That's all I heard.
[539:15.89]Not anymore.
[539:16.41]I'm determined.
[539:31.53]It was three hours ago when you almost quit.
[539:44.70]That's so bad.
[539:49.53]That was so bad.
[539:51.35]That was so bad.
[539:53.49]Has he even stopped one time?
[540:00.16]Guys, I just can't- has he even stopped?
[540:02.31]He's fucking bad.
[540:03.93]Alright, let's just keep going straight through.
[540:25.78]Alright, so if it was, if we were like in a real life scenario, where like, you know, you, oh, hey, welcome, come to the Jerma out here by Twitch meet and greet.
[540:33.03]And like, I'm like, hey, what's up?
[540:33.93]How are you?
[540:34.47]And you're kind of waiting to say hello and show up.
[540:37.63]And would you say that you're fucking bad at games?
[540:39.93]I don't think you would.
[540:43.08]I think you'd be like.
[540:58.61]Jeremy!
[540:59.87]It's such an honor to meet you!
[541:04.01]Look at the ego.
[541:31.22]Oh, Jeremy, it's such an honor to meet you.
[541:33.46]Remember when you full cocked your head backwards and fully catapulted down, thread, and put through your desk?
[541:41.94]That was, wow, that was ridiculous.
[541:43.33]I can't believe you actually could do that.
[541:47.55]You just went in the half.
[541:51.73]You didn't even need to use your hands.
[542:03.27]Mr. President, you are experiencing radar trouble.
[542:06.82]You can't move carelessly about until the radar jamming station is destroyed.
[542:14.14]A6.
[542:14.30]So when is the adjournment meetup?
[542:21.61]I'm not doing one on Twitter.
[542:23.81]This is a bomb.
[542:42.62]At least they have a radar.
[542:46.27]Wait up.
[542:47.23]Find that meter.
[542:47.85]Go find Dr. Bobby.
[542:48.51]I'm gonna find Dr. Bobby.
[542:50.23]I'm done.
[542:50.75]I'm sorry.
[543:08.40]We may be able to... We may be able to... We may be able to... We may be able to...
[543:19.00]Oh I don't want to be up here - it's almost over.
[543:37.37]So don't destroy any... Just do it now!
[543:40.28]You know, like, why... I'm not going to use it on the actual White House.
[543:46.06]Why not just do it now?
[543:49.18]I can't use it on... Should I stop swearing?
[543:57.95]My mother... Actually, my mother told me recently.
[543:59.51]I guess we should stop swearing, actually.
[544:06.80]Like, I've tried that before, man.
[544:08.70]She's like, it's not a good look for the camera.
[544:15.22]And I was like, you know what?
[544:15.88]You're up.
[544:21.85]So from now on.
[544:28.84]Oh no!
[544:29.94]Oh my, please, oh my god, oh my god, what happened?
[544:32.52]Why did I do that?
[544:33.68]I tried, I didn't have enough boost.
[544:36.64]Oh my god, and I have two things left.
[544:39.49]I can't fucking believe it.
[544:42.09]I can't believe it.
[544:42.97]I just want to get out of this stupid area.
[544:46.89]Oh my god, I need to look for a shield.
[544:49.15]I have to, otherwise there's no way I'm going to do this.
[544:59.26]Mines in the hallway.
[545:01.24]Sloppy goddamn hallway.
[545:03.32]Put mines in it.
[545:04.83]Just in case.
[545:07.03]Let's just lay him down.
[545:10.11]Oh my god, I'm so aggravated.
[545:11.95]I can't believe it.
[545:15.71]I had full health too.
[545:17.91]Mines do, like, two full bars.
[545:21.61]Why?
[545:21.75]Why would they do that much damage?
[545:37.22]I got the offensive augment.
[545:38.92]I'm so happy about this.
[545:41.60]It's been 10 hours and they can't manage the boost.
[545:57.17]Yeah, I've been sitting here for 10 hours.
[546:01.38]Albert Einstein, if he was sitting in a chair for 10 hours playing this game, would not be able to do that.
[546:06.10]Thanks for the warning.
[546:34.20]Albert Einstein wouldn't even have my standard right now, are you serious?
[546:40.28]I think he'd write, like, a few theories and then go to bed.
[546:46.30]Whoops.
[546:46.58]No.
[546:46.64]No.
[546:46.78]Whatever.
[546:54.09]There's probably another one in there.
[547:05.56]There's nothing in these.
[547:08.12]And I'm dead.
[547:09.10]Somehow.
[547:09.92]I got, like, sandwiched.
[547:11.26]I thought these guys were dead.
[547:14.63]We have to do this whole thing again.
[547:15.97]President, sorry there's no help anywhere.
[547:26.21]This is gonna be a Christmas miracle if I'm able to do this.
[547:29.56]Look at all my ammo.
[547:50.50]All this shit going on in this next, uh, area.
[547:53.64]No, I'm in trouble.
[547:56.20]Uh, what am I gonna do here?
[548:02.48]I have to stick to this, the thing I was doing before, except this time don't, like, accidentally destroy the whole White House.
[548:11.31]Like I did before, somehow, last time.
[548:13.01]I'm gonna go actually look around for, uh, ammo.
[548:19.93]Let's box the cat here.
[548:22.01]Okay, I found a couple.
[548:23.07]I found two.
[548:23.65]I'm gonna go to the other side.
[548:26.17]There's more boxes over here.
[548:27.21]What was that?
[548:46.35]It doesn't help.
[548:50.13]Gotta get rid of the helicopters.
[548:54.27]Oh, there's the tanks.
[548:56.25]Let's just... Let's just... Let's just... Let's just... Let's just... Let's just... Let's just... Let's just... Do not destroy the White House.
[549:18.07]I see a shield over there.
[549:20.03]I see one.
[549:23.70]Got it.
[549:24.04]Okay.
[549:24.90]Doing just fine.
[549:25.64]Relax.
[549:26.32]Pull back.
[549:27.22]I'm going to go to the right side now.
[549:59.49]What do we got?
[550:00.95]Come on.
[550:01.45]Up in the knees.
[550:06.81]Bullshit.
[550:08.39]Bullshit.
[550:18.02]Thirsty.
[550:20.88]What does that mean?
[550:26.24]Don't hit the White House.
[550:31.54]I got so much more important stuff going on than that.
[550:37.56]There we go.
[550:38.12]Alright.
[550:38.80]Into the good spot.
[550:41.38]Do not shoot the fucking under the armor's skin.
[550:49.51]Do the whole area.
[550:50.25]Don't do anything dumb.
[550:52.87]I am intensely focusing right now.
[550:57.92]There it is.
[550:58.37]I got plenty of ammo.
[550:59.07]Get rid of this little base over.
[551:01.17]Don't see that one.
[551:02.03]Here come the missiles.
[551:04.05]Just relax.
[551:05.43]It's not even a big deal.
[551:06.45]You've handled way worse.
[551:09.47]All the items in here.
[551:26.84]Okay.
[551:27.42]I could be very upset about it.
[551:28.26]I could be very mad about that, but I'm not gonna be.
[551:39.07]Doing just fine.
[551:39.75]Good.
[551:40.51]Nice job.
[551:42.35]I would shake my hand right now.
[551:56.55]Ready.
[551:56.95]Open up.
[552:02.72]It's nice and easy.
[552:03.48]Just nice and easy.
[552:05.44]It's nice and easy.
[552:09.34]It's going to open again.
[552:10.06]Wait for it to open.
[552:13.62]Do not shoot that.
[552:14.81]Why is it on my display?
[552:17.37]Why is it on my heads up display?
[552:18.57]Off the side.
[552:25.80]Clear out the trash.
[552:27.22]Right there.
[552:27.72]Open up.
[552:28.92]Come on.
[552:29.22]Open up.
[552:29.53]Open up.
[552:36.95]Do it again.
[552:37.41]This is the perfect weapon for this.
[552:43.31]Holy shit.
[552:43.77]What's firing at me from over here?
[552:45.14]I don't have time for that.
[552:50.32]Clear out the trash.
[552:51.50]I have to.
[552:52.82]I'm going to get dumped on it.
[552:59.85]It's you.
[553:00.27]Alright.
[553:02.17]Alright, get rid of this tank.
[553:11.36]Enough.
[553:13.94]Right side done.
[553:16.36]That's it?
[553:22.89]Is it one more?
[553:25.19]Where is it?
[553:26.45]On the top?
[553:34.50]It's up top.
[553:38.58]Don't go too crazy.
[553:39.56]Wait for the next one to open.
[553:41.67]Do not.
[553:42.25]Okay.
[553:42.59]The White House is getting hurt.
[553:57.24]Come on.
[553:57.56]Come on.
[554:02.77]I didn't.
[554:03.07]I beat the game.
[554:05.33]Got my pods upgraded.
[554:33.87]The White House was back in the hands of the American people that long last the United States had won back its freedom.
[554:38.43]However, the mastermind of its misery remained at large.
[554:41.19]The stage had been set for a final clash to determine whose version of justice the history books would honor.
[554:46.42]The dice were about to be rolled one last time for America, and it wasn't clear whose side Lady Luck was going to be on.
[554:54.90]Ladies and gentlemen.
[554:55.90]Yes.
[554:57.40]Lady Luck.
[554:57.90]Richard has disappeared.

[555:31.83]We're heading to... Yes, Mr. President.
[555:33.67]Let's go.
[555:38.75]The Vice President, Rich, my only advice to you is this.
[555:42.77]Beat him to a pulp.
[555:44.95]This mission goes by the call name... Good luck and Godspeed, Mr. President.
[555:49.87]That's the name?
[555:50.73]Did I skip it?
[555:51.81]No, I didn't.
[555:53.70]Did I skip it?
[555:54.95]Okay.
[556:10.25]I need to buy something here.
[556:12.85]No, no, no, no.
[556:15.67]What was I going to do?
[556:20.31]It's going to be just like on rails or something.
[556:22.12]It's not going to be hard.
[556:24.78]The Gatling gun, right.
[556:26.12]That was right.
[556:26.94]That was right.
[556:27.36]That was right.
[556:27.80]That was right.
[556:29.38]That was right.
[556:30.30]Okay.
[556:35.50]How much is this?
[556:37.84]Gatling gun has been acquired.
[556:41.16]Also... Where's the next one?
[556:47.07]I got the best bazooka, right?
[556:48.09]I already got it.
[556:49.13]Missile launcher.
[556:51.47]This is the best missile launcher in the game.
[556:53.79]I'll take it.
[556:55.95]Put it on.
[557:04.60]Okay, that's that.
[557:06.54]I'm gonna put the other side... It's gonna be the... this thing.
[557:10.64]This crazy thing.
[557:12.04]So this is the big one here, okay?
[557:15.82]Next is gonna be... I'm thinking... Let's put the gatling gun here.
[557:22.60]Should I do two gatling guns?
[557:25.05]I don't have enough.
[557:39.76]Should be another machine gun then, shouldn't it?
[557:41.06]Alright, let's try it with this.
[557:46.36]I got really good stuff.
[557:49.94]Let's go.
[557:51.79]Final mission!
[557:52.65]Final mission of the game!
[557:53.77]Let's go!
[557:59.07]Richard, come out!
[558:03.65]Here we go.
[558:27.80]Do I have to- wait, is this a goblet?
[558:28.64]How many do I have to fight them both?
[558:29.52]Is it- I think this is a glo- oh, no.
[558:30.78]Oh, please.
[558:31.76]What do you want on your tombstone?
[558:35.46]Hmm.
[559:00.48]I can't catch that briefcase.
[559:03.20]I killed him too fast.
[559:05.05]I can't get the... I hope that's not a valuable item.
[559:15.10]You showed him who's boss, Mr. President.
[559:20.66]Bravo, Michael.
[559:22.92]Oh, it was a dummy.
[559:25.48]Richard!
[559:26.10]Please, not all night.
[559:26.66]Please, not all night.
[559:27.50]It already has...
[559:53.13]Where is he?
[559:53.57]Is he just flying around?
[560:13.70]Oh my goodness!
[560:14.96]Just hold on, wait a minute!
[560:18.72]I got lucky tonight, I think.
[560:25.80]Where is he?
[560:37.47]Almost coined!
[560:39.29]Gatling gun, let's go.
[560:41.11]I don't think I hit him one time.
[561:19.47]I gotta get close.
[562:09.01]He's bad!
[562:10.35]Stop!
[562:10.85]I'm fine!
[562:15.81]Sweet, sweet.
[562:18.19]Oh, you are so sweet, Michael.
[562:21.91]Like gulping a cup of condensed milk.
[562:24.89]What is going on, though?
[562:29.77]Think you can kill me, huh?
[562:31.03]Sweet, sweet.
[562:33.27]Alright, let's take it outside.
[562:34.51]I'm gonna keep the Gatling gun on.
[562:38.37]This is fun.
[562:38.91]He's on the move.
[562:39.65]Chase after him, Mr. President.
[562:45.62]I thought you guys were lying to me when the last level was Vegas.
[562:48.08]That's so funny.
[562:49.16]I did not think that that was going to be... Alright, where do you go from here?
[562:57.83]Do we go aside?
[563:09.35]This is not an epic fight anymore.
[563:11.07]Oh, wait.
[563:16.18]Some scientists were among the POWs you rescued.
[563:25.38]Further in?
[563:31.39]Not even to, like, clap his hands.
[563:38.35]The vice president either lost at class or ran out the back.
[563:42.29]Go after him, Mr. President.
[563:44.24]I am.
[563:52.77]He went out that way Okay, good he's out here Richard you can run but you can't hide Catch your dream
[564:21.77]Who's mocking who?
[564:25.03]Oh, I hated that.
[564:25.99]Knock that jerk off the roof.
[564:30.83]He's a jerk.
[564:54.03]Hit him.
[564:58.04]Did I get him?
[565:00.90]I didn't get him.
[565:06.38]There it is.
[565:09.95]You break it, you bought it, Michael.
[565:12.29]You'll pay for the damages with your life.
[565:25.30]Out of ammo.
[565:29.30]I can't get off of this.
[565:30.76]Holy shit.
[565:31.32]What the hell did he just say?
[565:35.64]Jesus.
[565:36.31]Phase three.
[566:01.51]Yeah.
[566:01.85]I do need ammo.
[566:12.14]I wonder if I can get it from anything in here.
[566:15.82]Offensive augment.
[566:16.48]I'm going to take my time here.
[566:21.96]I want to go look at the dumpster.
[566:27.52]There you go.
[566:27.88]Boxes.
[566:28.26]What's this?
[566:28.52]Heavy weapons?
[566:32.48]In the arms, good.
[566:34.52]Not any Gatling gun ammo, though.
[566:37.66]That's a real bummer.
[566:43.96]There are crates behind you.
[566:48.24]Oh, fuck, all the way down.
[566:51.10]What is that?
[567:00.10]How did I miss that?
[567:00.68]Because I was scrolling through to see what ammo that was.
[567:04.30]Don't matter.
[567:06.02]Actually, that's worth it.
[567:06.82]I know!
[567:11.81]Light arms.
[567:30.20]Alright.
[567:34.66]Heavy arms.
[567:37.62]Shield unit.
[567:40.35]Is he going to cut me off?
[567:41.81]Oh, fountains.
[567:42.75]I wanted those crates.
[568:01.01]Richard!
[568:03.93]Michael!
[568:11.36]We've got the stage all to ourselves!
[568:13.74]Uh oh, it's the final destination.
[568:15.08]No weapons?
[568:15.86]It ends here!
[568:18.49]Alright, we've got nowhere to go.
[568:28.79]I should have thought I was going to fall off the edge and die.
[568:31.45]I like the Virtua Fighter style.
[568:55.45]Get it!
[569:12.70]I'm cracking.
[569:15.79]I'm starting to crack.
[569:16.91]Hold on.
[569:17.39]I'm cracking.
[569:23.53]Nice one, Michael.
[569:25.99]Take it and die.
[569:28.45]And take it to your grave.
[569:31.46]he's doing it's like super move
[570:05.33]It's over, Richard.
[570:10.69]It's not over.
[570:12.01]This is like phase five.
[570:13.66]That's the... Space Shuttle.
[570:22.34]I have to fight this Space Shuttle?
[570:25.80]Hey, Mr. President.
[570:27.48]Mr. President?
[570:29.17]Mr. President!
[570:30.33]There we go.
[570:31.53]Space Station.
[570:33.86]that's pointless Mr. president nothing is pointless and the reason is because I'm the president of the great United States of America Mr. president jody I'm gonna step out into outer space see you soon oh my god I have to do this again
[571:08.12]E-E-A-S-E-A.
[571:21.95]Gold to play on Vegas, then.
[571:25.19]Given over 10 years of my life to this profession and no scene has ever engraved itself upon my mind the way this one did.
[571:29.33]Two men, two ideals, one outcome.
[571:30.83]I could not imagine where we would all stand now that things have gone the other way.
[571:35.09]President, are you alright?
[571:37.76]yes and very pleased about my first flight in space I just wish I had brought my camera Mr. president be sure and come back now the American people are waiting for you she says Mr. president as much as I say oh my god I am the president of the United States of America I'll be back

[572:17.54]Wait, he's not in space anymore?
[572:19.22]Wait, did he take the helmet off?
[572:21.38]He took the helmet off.
[572:22.84]Mr. President, don't take off the helmet!
[572:24.68]What are you trying to do?
[572:31.91]The Vice President has fortified... Knowing the Vice President's sinister nature, I predict he has some unexpected trump card up his sleeve.
[572:40.48]But Mr. President, you must be victorious at all costs.
[572:46.04]The reason is because you're the President of this great land.
[572:50.71]This mission goes by the call name... To the moon!
[572:56.15]Believe in your own justice.
[572:59.57]Alright.
[573:07.17]What am I missing that I can invest in?
[573:09.37]I like what I got now.

[573:54.82]I can't get it.
[574:05.70]Well, I got the Gatling gun, and then I'm going to put the... Assault Rifle, that RFRH here to get double, triple firepower.
[574:29.14]Give it a flamethrower.
[574:32.46]Check out the handguns.
[574:35.74]Maybe.
[574:37.68]I'll check them out.
[574:44.10]Handguns.

[575:22.66]I'll be alright.
[575:24.52]I'm not gonna do a 10 or 11 hour stream.
[575:26.07]I don't understand how these happen, they just do.
[575:31.35]Yeah, I mean today.
[575:32.51]It's almost midnight.
[575:33.31]I can't believe it's almost been 11 hours.
[575:34.99]What the hell am I doing?
[575:38.29]Alright.
[575:38.69]I'm going to try it with this.
[575:40.77]But I'm going to take off the trash here.
[575:44.37]This is like absolute trash.
[575:50.72]I'll put on Sam.
[575:55.58]Actually, no.
[575:55.96]Put this on.
[575:56.62]I feel like I could get use out of that.
[576:00.34]Yeah, this looks alright.
[576:04.60]Let's give it a go.
[576:10.93]I know, you even commented earlier on keeping Eastern viewers up until like 3.
[576:15.17]I know.
[576:17.35]Final mission, here we go, we're at the moon.
[576:23.67]Chasing 15 million feet after me.
[576:26.69]Now that's love.
[576:28.55]Well, I love you too, Michael.
[576:32.69]I love you so much, I can't stand it.
[576:38.03]So much, I want to kill you.
[576:41.35]Hold it, Richard!
[576:51.29]It's a big cannon.
[576:52.51]Two big cannons.
[576:54.23]I only have 300 seconds to beat this.
[577:16.17]I don't even know where to start.
[577:22.41]Mr. President, the barrier's shut.
[577:25.05]You won't be able to advance if you don't destroy it.
[577:38.92]Let's go!
[577:39.36]I'm almost out of time!
[577:41.70]I'm at 11 hours, man.
[577:52.11]Give me a break.
[577:52.61]Give me a little slack.
[578:15.01]Mister President, where are you heading?
[578:34.72]Mister President, do you think you can just run away?
[578:38.27]Mister President!
[578:49.25]I think I need a little bit of strength.
[578:51.53]Alright.
[579:21.88]I feel fucking full of energy.
[579:31.55]I'm not playing the game right now.
[579:33.13]The McChicken is home.
[579:37.41]Just kidding, it's me too.

[580:19.80]Shit.
[580:20.12]Up.
[580:22.14]I can't get up.

[580:38.98]Alright, let's go!
[580:57.46]Oh, you guys all going up there too?
[581:00.10]Cool.
[581:03.36]How do you know, Richard?
[581:10.33]Keep this up and he'll

[583:25.12]Okay.
[583:28.46]Oh my god.
[583:32.32]Yeah, I'm fine.
[583:33.02]I'm just fucking laughing really hard.
[583:44.66]Ugh.
[583:44.84]Sometimes I look over here, man, and I fucking see something so stupid, so funny.
[583:50.02]You guys kill me sometimes.
[583:51.22]Ugh.
[583:57.78]What do you stand for, Michael?
[584:01.16]Be certain now.
[584:02.54]As certain as the blood gushing out of your nose when I bash it in.
[584:06.85]Be certain of your death here and now.
[584:10.33]Okay, I'm good.
[584:12.37]Now I have to fight this thing.
[584:18.37]Now, come at me with all your body and soul.
[584:23.24]I'll hug you to death.
[584:25.85]Okay.
[584:26.15]Jesus, come on.
[584:27.60]I have so much of this shit.
[584:29.48]You didn't break any of them!

[585:33.83]Oh, fuck.
[585:34.49]There's health over there.
[585:36.87]I gotta get it.
[585:40.21]He's standing now in this tiny arena.
[585:41.80]God damn it.
[585:42.18]I have this health to my right.
[585:44.10]Left or right?
[585:44.86]Left, I think.
[586:00.25]Like, it fucking even matters.
[586:09.42]Like, impossible.
[586:11.44]Literally not even possible.
[586:15.54]the public who entrusted their futures to you the resistance and the presidential staff and your meddling secretary it's scripted it's scripted they'll be disappointed in you for falling short it's scripted it's scripted way to go Mr. president
[586:42.20]That is like unbearable.
[586:43.66]That fight is fucking unbearable.
[586:46.44]It's just like obnoxious.
[586:47.72]Like what the fuck?
[586:49.94]You gotta give me a break.
[586:54.27]That's just dumb.
[587:04.33]What a dumb fucking fight.
[587:15.07]Just spam that in a little bit.
[587:16.97]Just spam.
[587:19.54]Start the whole thing.
[587:48.37]No, sir.
[587:48.99]A musician was among the POWs you rescued.
[587:52.32]Why do they think a musician is space?
[587:57.72]I don't know.
[588:37.37]It's like, what's the strategy with this guy?
[588:38.93]Just, ult, spray, then you don't get hit by a random bullet?
[588:52.52]I don't need it.
[589:07.64]What is that noise?
[589:24.23]I'm beyond the point of my turn here.
[589:30.75]What the fuck is this thing?
[589:36.31]Okay, here we go.
[589:37.93]I'm saving my super for the big fight, the real one.
[590:08.71]I wish I could get, like, a speed upgrade or something.
[590:11.22]I feel like I'm so much slower than these things, man.
[590:12.80]I have to get... You know what?
[590:13.82]I gotta get a thing that destroys all incoming projectiles.
[590:21.25]I didn't mean to do that.
[590:23.11]I actually... I can't fucking believe it.
[590:24.85]I'm desperate.
[590:27.01]But I'm still firing.
[590:28.01]I think I'm... I think I'm firing still.
[590:34.63]This is not even a video game This is not even this isn't a video game
[591:03.00]I'm just coming to that realization right now.
[591:04.58]This is not even a game.
[591:26.28]I need one of those, the laser beams that destroy all projectiles.
[591:37.90]This fucking game.
[591:39.72]It's like... It's... Like, why?
[591:44.32]Why?
[591:44.78]This is... This Ben Boss is just... It does... I can't... I'm not allowed to say it.
[591:56.21]Am I allowed to say it?
[591:57.71]Should I say it?
[591:58.35]I think I'm just gonna say it.
[591:59.87]This game sucks.
[592:09.27]Can I say that?
[592:09.91]I think so.
[592:28.00]Somebody look up the ratings for this game.
[592:29.42]What does it have right now?
[592:30.46]Alright, I need to do...
[592:43.12]Wait, it's a machine gun.
[592:43.78]Right here it is.
[592:45.54]Intercepting fire.
[592:46.66]I just want like three of these.
[592:54.66]I think that changes everything.
[592:55.88]I really think it does.
[592:56.72]I think this thing here should help.
[592:59.80]I'm gonna do this one or two more times.
[593:10.25]Never let the joke die.
[593:31.01]Get out of here!
[593:31.69]Oh shit, I forgot about the ceiling.
[593:42.69]I'll go back down, please.
[593:57.35]I can't look at the link right now.
[593:59.15]I'm busy trying to complete this game It's taking all of my attention Don't click on the virus
[594:40.49]Wait, what?
[594:40.95]Oh, right.
[594:41.67]Alright, let's get out the big ones.
[594:47.74]Target, target, target.
[594:49.62]Why is it not locking on?
[594:50.34]No, that's not going to work.
[594:54.58]Why is it not locking on?
[594:59.78]I'm going to blow it up.
[595:04.81]So it's on my left side, so I have to use the right.
[595:07.99]Okay.
[595:09.47]I think this is going to be what's necessary.
[595:15.04]I really wish I could skip this part.
[595:20.00]I wish I could skip it.
[595:22.80]Let me just skip it.
[595:23.60]Let me just skip this part.
[595:28.14]I have 167 seconds.
[595:28.68]If I get up here with 150 seconds remaining, let's start from here.
[595:43.57]I have to play the game.
[595:53.13]Okay, here we go.
[595:54.53]It's time.
[595:56.03]I'm bringing out the MP7 and then the... this thing.
[596:03.28]Let's hope it's enough.
[596:05.40]Will it be enough?
[596:08.32]Only 20 bullets on this thing, keep in mind.
[596:10.70]Will it be enough?
[596:12.78]I'm going!
[596:14.12]Go!
[596:21.32]It is a little bit better, I think.
[596:24.03]Although this might just be a placebo effect.
[596:47.42]No, no, no, I want this back, please!
[596:48.86]I gotta get rid of all the assault rifles.
[596:57.35]I got nothing else, do I?
[596:58.45]In the fucking other hands.
[596:59.37]Oh, this is bad.
[597:00.21]This is really, really, really bad.
[597:05.17]I need ammo.
[597:22.07]Oh my god, this is... Get out of the corner.
[597:27.96]Here we go!
[598:04.53]There can't be another, there cannot be another phrase I'll never lose to you, Michael!
[598:29.15]Where is he going?
[598:31.21]Hurry and destroy it.
[598:34.65]Did I do it?
[598:41.39]That was easy.
[598:53.54]Wait.
[598:54.20]Was that me or him?
[598:59.27]I did it.
[599:02.67]Richard!
[599:05.83]At that speed and angle, he'll burn up like a shooting star.
[599:13.43]I'm going in.
[599:15.39]Impossible.
[599:17.17]Not even you can possibly stop a shooting star.
[599:24.33]Jody, who am I?
[599:26.07]I'm the president.
[599:28.97]I always make the impossible possible, and I'm gonna keep on doing so.
[599:44.70]Michael?
[599:46.62]Richard, it was your methods that were flawed.
[599:49.78]Our love for America won't change.
[600:03.58]Richard!
[600:04.66]That laugh is gonna kill me!
[600:06.40]This is one eternal flame with your justice!
[600:10.68]Mr. President!
[600:21.55]You've exceeded the critical point.
[600:23.87]There's no way out!
[600:26.25]Mr. President?
[600:28.32]This is how I'm sitting, you know what I'm saying?
[600:31.74]I'll show you after.
[600:43.85]This is how I'm sitting.
[600:52.29]Tomorrow's gonna be another busy day at the White House.
[600:57.47]I did it, I beat the game.
[600:58.09]Okay, that was fun.
[601:00.73]This is how I just was sitting during that cutscene.
[601:06.29]My fellow Americans, good morning.
[601:11.79]As Americans, we love freedom.
[601:16.26]But true freedom isn't a given like the air we breathe or the water we drink.
[601:23.83]About 240 years ago, our forefathers fought greatly, giving their blood, sweat, and tears.
[601:31.85]And in the end, they won our freedom.
[601:37.10]And we must never forget this.
[601:41.16]If anything appears that threatens our belief in this freedom, we will oppose it.
[601:50.17]We will crush it.
[601:54.56]In fighting to gain our freedom, we need no reasons.
[602:01.41]We require no just cause or flowery words.
[602:06.97]In order to protect our neighbors who love freedom and this faith in freedom, we continue to believe in our own justice.
[602:17.64]We won't abandon any battles.
[602:21.41]And the reason is because we are all citizens of the United States of America.
[602:29.57]And as long as you allow it, I will be a vanguard leading this fight.
[602:39.08]And the reason is because I'm the president of this great United States of America.
[603:06.52]I did it.
[603:07.30]This is 11 hours.
[603:09.14]And that was it.
[603:09.91]I did it.
[603:12.35]Okay.
[603:18.33]I can relax.
[603:19.57]Yeah.
[603:20.19]That's fun.
[603:21.11]That's it.
[603:47.39]What would you score this game?
[603:54.00]A three.
[604:07.49]Out of five.
[604:09.63]Two and a half out of five.
[604:11.59]I would eat here.
[604:17.42]I would give this a 2.5 out of 5.
[604:20.49]A 2.6 out of 5, just because of the funny voice acting.
[604:23.53]52 out of 100?
[604:44.21]Hey, I played it, didn't I?
[604:45.71]If I didn't, if I hated it, I wouldn't have done it.
[604:50.80]Now I'll click the link.
[604:53.42]That was Metal Wolf Chaos XD.
[605:05.34]Alright, let's look at this link.
[605:16.23]I look like the main character from number munchers
[605:41.05]By the way, that wasn't even from McDonald's.
[605:44.90]That was from Wendy's.
[605:45.82]Oh, what a scammer.
[605:59.00]Alright, I'm leaving.
[606:00.90]I'm out of here.
[606:12.37]What about the tier lists?
[606:18.77]That was fun.
[606:19.67]It was.
[606:21.13]For all how bullshit some of the stuff was in this game.
[606:23.65]And how over the top it was.
[606:24.97]And how weird some of it was.
[606:27.70]I still enjoyed myself.
[606:30.38]5.9 out of 10.
[606:31.60]There you go.
[606:33.42]Just barely below 6.
[606:34.48]Almost a passing grade.
[606:35.74]No, but that's still alright. 5.9.
[606:50.24]5.9, that's alright.
[606:51.32]That was still, that was worth it.
[606:55.32]Some teachers actually will pass you if you get a 5.9.
[606:57.68]If you get a 59... That's a 5.9, but if you, you know, nostalgia factor, it could probably bump you up to like a 6.5. 6.4.
[607:23.38]Let me show this on stream just because I have to, because it's another one of these.
[607:26.66]Actually, I can't even get it.
[607:29.84]Alright, forgive me for... I'm going to do the bits tomorrow.
[607:33.61]I actually, like, am dying at this seat.
[607:37.09]We'll do the bits tomorrow.
[607:38.57]We'll do a little just hangout session at the end of tomorrow.
[607:41.73]Tomorrow is not going to be an 11-hour stream.
[607:44.14]I can guarantee that.
[607:45.18]I can promise you that.
[607:53.86]So, we'll go over these bits tomorrow.
[607:56.88]The stream's not gonna be... The stream's gonna start in, like, 16 hours.
[608:02.40]14 hours or something.
[608:11.59]I am just... I'm just... I'm wrecked right now.
[608:19.18]So, we're not gonna go that late tomorrow, I promise.
[608:22.93]Because tomorrow is going to be a little bit more elaborate.
[608:27.93]Tomorrow I'm playing You're in the Movies.
[608:29.73]It's going to be an on-camera stream with a green screen behind me.
[608:33.83]It's a whole game based around being on a green screen.
[608:39.66]Yeah, sorry I'm not doing the bits.
[608:41.12]I really hate doing this, but we'll do them all tomorrow.
[608:47.48]Kind of like we did last time when the stream got cut off.
[608:49.24]We just kind of hung out, played a game, and just kind of chilled and went over them and talked about stuff.
[608:55.12]Now, the credits I can do, because the credits are right here.
[609:02.07]These sub-credits.
[609:08.68]While we're here, though, I do want to catch the community subs that I did miss.
[609:17.32]I do want to say that.
[609:18.78]Say thanks to those people, because there was a bunch of community subs tonight.
[609:23.94]Here they come!
[609:26.97]Can you see them?
[609:28.35]Why can I not see these?
[609:31.13]Roll credits, let's go.
[609:31.89]Holy shit, that's a lot.
[609:36.30]Thank you, everybody, for the subs.
[609:47.75]seriously a lot of resubs a lot of community subs speaking of community subs uh magellan gave five community subs kazzy gave five community subs Jerma sucks gave five community subs thank you there was a lot of random 150 to all the bits we went over I think I got I think we got all of them
[610:15.81]And we will absolutely slowly go over these tomorrow after the stream.
[610:19.97]Am I quiet?
[610:21.09]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[610:21.65]Why is this so good?
[610:22.63]Sorry about that.
[610:25.43]And then tingy right now thanks to the five community subs.
[610:34.71]That game was good.
[610:36.37]I liked that game.
[610:39.49]Enough to give it like a 6.3.
[610:44.21]What is it?
[610:45.11]5.9?
[610:45.13]5.9.
[610:45.57]I think 6.1 is fair.
[610:48.74]I'll meet you in the middle.
[610:58.27]He keeps going up.
[611:04.61]Rank all the FromSoftware games.
[611:06.13]Okay.
[611:08.74]Bloodborne.
[611:09.56]Demon's Souls.
[611:14.36]Dark Souls 1.
[611:17.46]Sekiro and Dark Souls 3 are kind of tied, I think.
[611:20.24]Dark Souls 2.
[611:27.08]I said Demon's Souls.
[611:27.66]Yeah, Demon's Souls is at the top.
[611:28.76]So Dark Souls 2.
[611:32.75]Every video game that released for Super Nintendo.
[611:36.29]Nintendo 64, PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2.
[611:41.73]Every putt-putt game.
[611:47.43]And then Metal Wolf Chaos.
[612:00.18]Is this worst to best?
[612:02.30]Maybe.
[612:04.19]He's still bad.
[612:05.13]No, I'm not.
[612:09.95]Oh, this was one of those streams, wasn't it?
[612:13.29]Sometimes you just lock in and decide you're gonna do something.
[612:22.16]I love how Sekiro destroys people's egos and makes them really mad at it.
[612:26.04]It did that to me.
[612:27.90]I was so frustrated in Sekiro.
[612:30.97]I did it though.
[612:31.45]I completed it.
[612:32.03]I got to the very end.
[612:45.41]Is that, like, three meltdowns?
[612:46.81]It was impressive.
[612:48.69]Oh, it's been 11 hours and... It's almost 11 and a half hours.
[612:51.23]That's... That's, like, almost two streams.
[613:00.12]No, it was more like one funny pretend laugh-out-loud meltdown.
[613:06.98]One real meltdown.
[613:12.24]Yeah, one of those meltdowns was just for fun.
[613:31.40]Alright, good night guys.
[613:32.30]I'll see you tomorrow.
[613:32.94]We'll do the best tomorrow.
[613:34.46]And this stream tomorrow is going to be all over the place.
[613:37.24]I cannot even describe what we're going to have.
[613:39.60]It might just be a disaster.
[613:42.18]But I don't think so.
[613:42.78]It should be a lot of fun.
[613:44.72]See you tomorrow.
[613:45.56]Or see you later today.
[613:46.42]However you want to do it.
[613:47.54]Probably around 4 o'clock Pacific.
[613:48.90]3 to 4.
[613:50.46]I'm going to do regular time tomorrow.
[613:57.95]Good night.
[614:00.27]And try it yourself.
[614:01.73]Metal Gear Chaos XD.
[614:07.31]Give it a try.
[614:07.87]It was a little hard.
[614:08.75]It was a little crazy.
[614:11.79]Interesting money mechanic.
[614:14.50]It was alright.
[614:15.24]I had some fun.
[614:16.38]I did.
[614:16.98]But I didn't like a lot of parts.
[614:18.72]But I did like some parts.
[614:21.34]That's my review.
[614:22.76]See you tomorrow.
[614:23.76]Have a great night.
[614:35.58]you
