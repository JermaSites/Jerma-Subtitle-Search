[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.09]Okay, now I want to make everything clear before we get on, we get started here.
[00:03.63]What's supposed to happen.
[00:06.42]Two people, let's just say, Jerome versus Star, ignore Etalyx.
[00:09.80]He's not supposed to be here.
[00:11.32]It's him.
[00:12.42]Darren.
[00:13.62]We get cards, and then we yell at each other about who would win the fight until one of us wins in the fight based on people in my chat using the hashtag.
[00:23.91]I don't know, okay, I don't understand what we have to do, but we'll figure it out.
[00:27.11]We'll figure it out.
[00:28.57]They're all going to vote for me because you told them to ignore me.
[00:31.21]You didn't ignore me.
[00:31.95]You get to choose cards?
[00:32.97]I didn't know you get to choose cards.
[00:35.41]So I just watch while you two play now.
[00:40.17]Wrong way.
[00:41.39]Oh, look what's over there.
[00:42.89]These two guys are playing cards.
[00:44.87]Oh, that's cool.
[00:47.68]You're picking some cards, Etalyx.
[00:52.04]This game wouldn't let us play unless there were three people, so we got Etalyx.
[00:56.04]But it's a two-person game.
[00:58.43]I'm here.
[00:59.05]There's nothing you can do about it.
[01:01.37]You're probably gonna vote, but you seem like a heckler.
[01:03.95]Okay.
[01:06.13]Okay, and there's the scenario at the bottom.
[01:08.18]So we're on an oil platform.
[01:10.52]The floor is lava.
[01:12.46]Leprechaun versus Frankenstein.
[01:14.44]I'm gonna win.
[01:16.20]Immediately.
[01:16.86]Because I can't stop dancing.
[01:18.54]Hey!
[01:19.70]You can't talk.
[01:20.66]This isn't your game.
[01:21.71]This is my stream now.
[01:23.07]You understand?
[01:24.07]You get a minute.
[01:24.55]Etalyx.
[01:24.87]Go.
[01:25.07]You get a minute.
[01:25.55]Explain.
[01:25.79]Hey.
[01:26.64]Your card is roid raging like you are at this very moment.
[01:30.98]Leprechaun riding a motorcycle on an oil platform.
[01:36.21]The floor may be lava, but I come from rainbows.
[01:39.57]You understand?
[01:40.36]And when I go to rainbows, I get gold.
[01:43.02]When gold mixes with lava, turns into molten gold.
[01:46.90]You can shape that into whatever you want to shape it into.
[01:50.06]I win, by default.
[01:53.22]People are already voting.
[01:54.55]We haven't even stated our cases yet.
[01:56.71]I'm Frankenstein.
[02:00.45]I'm roid raging.
[02:01.65]Frankenstein's already buff, so he's super buff.
[02:03.77]Leprechauns are tiny little midget things.
[02:05.47]I'm going to kick your ass.
[02:06.93]You can't catch a leprechaun, you understand?
[02:09.01]I'm a hoarder.
[02:09.75]I have a motorcycle.
[02:11.08]I have, like, wraps.
[02:12.46]I don't have to stand in a lava.
[02:14.00]I can catch you.
[02:14.90]You may be a hoarder, but you're not going to get my pot of gold.
[02:18.98]Oh, that was a line.
[02:19.86]That was a pretty good line.
[02:23.20]I'm saying that Frankenstein was hoarding... I'm gonna go with a spaceship.
[02:27.86]And I'm just leaving, I guess.
[02:29.92]Hey, if you just... Don't, because your chat can't spell leprechaun.
[02:33.68]Oh!
[02:35.77]Frankenstein's, like, a hard word.
[02:38.13]You might put the I before the E. It's Stein.
[02:40.63]It's Jerma for stone.
[02:42.55]Leprechaun's also a hard word.
[02:44.23]It is.
[02:44.53]I mean... We still got 25 seconds to burn here.
[02:49.09]What else?
[02:50.71]What else?
[02:51.33]I think the cases have been made.
[02:53.01]I think it's very clear that Frankenstein is the one true gamer president.
[02:59.98]I think that Jerma wins just because.
[03:02.78]You can't catch him.
[03:04.88]When I vote, do I get like 10 extra points?
[03:06.86]Do you have an option to vote right now?
[03:08.66]It says, who do I think?
[03:09.50]Vote at the end of the round.
[03:10.94]Oh, then I guess.
[03:13.41]Okay, so I'm gonna have to, honestly, I'm gonna have to say Frankenstein on this one.
[03:16.98]Does the fire going back and forth mean, like, that's who's currently winning?
[03:21.12]I don't know.
[03:21.52]I think that means your character's dying more.
[03:23.48]Yeah, you're getting hurt.
[03:25.76]It's like pain symbols.
[03:27.35]Ow!
[03:27.77]Well, the floor is lava.
[03:29.71]Let's see who won.
[03:30.91]A roid-raging Frankenstein, honestly, would just have to swing his leg as hard as he could into the leprechaun's face.
[03:37.13]Yeah, I would kick over the whole oil thing.
[03:41.34]I love the whole quarter thing.
[03:42.46]Like, who cares?
[03:43.12]What does that even mean?
[03:45.98]Oh, Frankenstein wins this one.
[03:48.06]I don't even care about my lines.
[03:49.80]I have some good lines.
[03:50.66]You did have good lines, but... I have the home field advantage.
[03:54.16]That is so fucking loud.
[03:55.97]That was so loud.
[03:59.97]Alright, I got an experience point.
[04:01.49]Why did I get more EXP than you?
[04:02.61]Did I?
[04:03.87]Because I picked the right winning side?
[04:05.39]Is that what happened?
[04:05.91]I guess you betted correctly.
[04:08.59]Okay.
[04:08.73]Okay.
[04:09.31]I don't know, use your XP to unlock more cards.
[04:11.13]Oh, okay, we're good.
[04:12.43]Final round.
[04:13.67]Rigged.
[04:14.45]Rigged.
[04:15.31]I agree.
[04:16.57]That's me versus Jerma now, because I won.
[04:19.93]What do I have to do?
[04:20.64]Choose your cards?
[04:22.32]Yeah, you pick two cards and it gives you a third random one.
[04:26.26]So you get to choose your character.
[04:28.32]Got it.
[04:29.48]Oh, this is a real geek character from the Geek and Gamer Pack.
[04:32.54]Okay.
[04:38.13]I think my choices were obvious.
[04:42.39]I think mine's gonna win.
[04:43.89]I really do.
[04:45.54]Yeah, we bought some Geek and Gamer packs.
[04:49.08]One of my choices was V from Vendetta.
[04:53.11]So our characters used to date?
[04:55.19]Yeah, you go first, Jeremy.
[04:56.53]Tell us what you got.
[04:57.55]Alright, so we're trapped in a broken elevator.
[05:01.00]First of all, you're Kim Jong-il.
[05:02.60]He's already dead.
[05:03.96]I think I just win this one by default.
[05:05.30]But if we have to talk about P's and Q's here...
[05:10.73]Trapped in an elevator, and we both used to date.
[05:12.79]I didn't know the Death Knight from World of Warcraft used to date Kim Jong Il, but you know, whatever.
[05:16.69]Anyways, one swing of his giant of Frostmourne, you know, his Death Knights, are typically made from the extract of the Lich King, who was Arthas and Kim Jong Il.
[05:26.84]How are you gonna get to me if you're handcuffed to a golf cart?
[05:29.94]I'm stepping on the gas and I'm going to drive into you.
[05:32.02]Like, you know what I mean?
[05:33.02]But your legs hurt.
[05:33.90]You took an arrow to the knee.
[05:35.08]Geek.
[05:35.48]The orange ones are geeks.
[05:36.78]Orange geek.
[05:37.96]The geek and gamer culture, you know, aside.
[05:40.20]We're going to talk about the reality here.
[05:42.55]I'm handcuffed to the golf cart doesn't mean I can't get behind the fucking wheel and drive you into the wall.
[05:46.57]But your knee hurts so you can't put your foot on the pedal.
[05:50.01]I've made my case.
[05:50.75]I'll just icy touch you, Paul Yin.
[05:52.73]The people that know that movement world.
[05:53.91]Go ahead.
[05:54.81]I'd like to hear a rebuttal.
[05:56.89]Kim Jong Il.
[05:58.11]Also, I'd like to mention we're trapped inside of a broken elevator.
[06:00.64]There is not enough room for your golf cart.
[06:02.66]You're probably stuck.
[06:03.88]I don't know where you're putting the gas on.
[06:06.04]We're, like, in the golf cart.
[06:07.22]The golf cart is the elevator.
[06:08.33]I have already talked your pants off, which means you have a minus 40 defense rating.
[06:12.77]Death Knights, well, they lose their pants.
[06:14.07]They lose a lot of their special abilities.
[06:16.15]I wouldn't know anything about frost leggings.
[06:18.44]I wouldn't begin to know that, but I also just ate a mushroom, which means I have one extra life, which, by the way, is why Kim Jong Il is not dead.
[06:24.96]Geek and Gamer referenced that to Mario.
[06:27.03]So I'm not dead yet.
[06:27.99]I still have a chance.
[06:28.71]You guys can change your votes if you think that he was dead.
[06:35.10]You're already dead.
[06:36.52]Okay, my argument is we used to date.
[06:39.36]I've already talked your pants off, which means I've already like got you back.
[06:43.38]So that's how I win.
[06:45.06]His character died a long time ago.
[06:47.72]I ate a mushroom.
[06:48.66]I get a one up.
[06:50.20]My character's undead.
[06:51.16]Yours is just dead.
[06:52.68]I win.
[06:54.41]Character doesn't have pants.
[06:56.49]Good.
[06:57.77]That's how I like it.
[07:00.31]And check out my Frostmourne baby.
[07:01.91]I better have fucking won.
[07:05.91]Now everyone's gonna vote, oh, Kim Jong Il, because that's like, he's like the one that would never win.
[07:09.81]I would win in real life.
[07:13.07]That takes a while to finalize.
[07:14.19]Well, let's see what they think.
[07:16.43]What did you vote, Etalyx?
[07:18.29]I'm not telling until the results are in.
[07:20.26]With the stream delay, like, it's already too late.
[07:24.02]It's too late?
[07:24.86]It's too late.
[07:25.58]It's already happened.
[07:26.54]I voted for Kim Jong Il.
[07:29.68]And I was wrong.
[07:30.38]Holy boy, with a 60-40 majority, folks.
[07:32.80]I gave you the vote for the pants-off defensive rating and the mushroom comment.
[07:37.70]Get the fuck out of here!
[07:38.72]See that, like, punch it and, like, kick it I just did to your character?
[07:42.10]I don't know.
[07:45.91]Dermot's currently winning.
[07:47.01]Are you guys happy with what you did?
[07:48.19]350 experience.
[07:52.11]I win.
[07:52.59]I'm just gonna exit and end the stream.
[07:57.96]Just close the game.
[07:59.21]Yeah, I think I'm done.
[08:01.33]You're just done.
[08:02.79]Sounds like a celebratory coffee drink.
[08:04.13]I mean, we are on the screen for a while, aren't we?
[08:06.63]Wait, you're the champion.
[08:07.49]Is it already over?
[08:09.07]I won.
[08:09.45]I win.
[08:09.93]This is the whole game.
[08:10.93]Good stream, guys.
[08:11.83]I enjoyed it.
[08:12.77]The fuck was that?
[08:20.72]I just kicked this out.
[08:21.72]What the fuck is this?
[08:37.21]Okay, let me re-invite them again.
[08:44.89]Good stream, good night.
[08:46.74]Game sucks.
[08:48.96]You know, actually, I didn't even get the chance to vote, like, who was gonna win a round.
[08:53.22]Oh, fuck you.
[08:54.76]Because I played every round.
[08:56.84]Mute yourself in TeamSpeak before I fucking lose it.
[08:59.22]Oh my god.
[09:01.25]Geek.
[09:01.75]Gamer.
[09:02.27]Geek.
[09:02.75]Gamer.
[09:03.25]Geek and gamer culture.
[09:04.31]Geeks and gamers.
[09:05.43]Oh, fuck.
[09:05.83]I'm so sorry.
[09:06.47]I'm like too excited right now.
[09:07.77]This is like fun.
[09:10.99]Who would stand you up?
[09:16.07]You ready?
[09:16.98]You got it right.
[09:19.18]I'm ready.
[09:19.62]Let's go.
[09:20.14]You have to click the ready up, I mean.
[09:22.26]Oh.
[09:23.00]God.
[09:27.60]okay let's play like let's do like have fun for like I can't I can't hear me anymore round one hello hello yeah let's have fun for like one and a half rounds let's go okay it's me again in Jerma Jerma versus star man um I gotta sit on the bench again oh these all suck uh uh I got it
[09:56.72]So there's no options to extend the romp?
[09:58.84]Oh my god, I'm gonna fucking just win.
[10:03.18]I win.
[10:05.68]No, you don't.
[10:07.02]Hold your votes until we actually, like, you know what I'm talking about here.
[10:11.69]You go first.
[10:12.39]We're in Gettysburg.
[10:13.49]The floor is lava again.
[10:14.79]There's like three cards in this game.
[10:17.52]Go ahead.
[10:19.08]You're a boy scout armed with a diamond sword, assisted by a sniper.
[10:24.39]Yeah, I've got a sniper just shooting at you.
[10:27.01]Holy shit.
[10:28.65]Well, I'm Wolverine.
[10:30.07]I've got an adamantium skeleton.
[10:31.44]You think one sniper's gonna be able to stop Wolverine?
[10:33.54]I don't think so.
[10:34.82]I also can shoot bees from my mouth, which are going to seek out the sniper and distract him from an accurate shot.
[10:41.52]My Sonic screwdriver is going to be able to disable the Boy Scout in any way, because you just think, and this Sonic screwdriver does what you think.
[10:48.95]Rebuttal.
[10:50.61]Okay, well, Boy Scouts are trained in the act of survival.
[10:55.77]They are, that's true.
[10:56.47]And especially armed with a diamond sword, you're gonna come after me, but you know, I can find a way out.
[11:01.24]I'll dig down and get some worms and put it on a hook and cast and get a fish and eat it.
[11:04.90]Diamond sword, by the way, that's pretty geeky.
[11:06.48]That's pretty gamer culture.
[11:07.32]Yeah, that's a pretty geeky Minecraft-y Game Boy Color.
[11:11.36]Game Boy, yeah.
[11:12.28]The sniper, by the way, didn't really talk about who the sniper was.
[11:15.28]It was a good sniper.
[11:20.35]Got a chance to the sniper.
[11:24.67]I was gonna say Widowmaker, I was gonna go, oh, Widowmaker, but that was just dumb.
[11:30.03]Honestly, I don't see how I win this.
[11:32.33]You don't even know who the sniper is and you think you're going to beat me.
[11:34.97]You Wolverine with bees!
[11:37.86]I'm a fucking nine-year-old boy with a Minecraft suit.
[11:40.92]I am the number one X-Men, indisputable number one X-Men, never loses, main character, with bees in his mouth, number one animal, and I have a Sonic screwdriver, which is...
[11:51.82]the most powerful weapon in the whole universe, as far as Dark Souls is concerned.
[11:54.82]The sniper better be fucking good, because I just got back from Minecon with, like, my dad.
[11:58.63]Like, yeah, I just got destroyed.
[12:02.13]I'm gonna hit, but you'll just, like, slash me through my face.
[12:05.13]Am I allowed to, like, give an opinion also, or?
[12:06.97]Give an opinion, as long as that sniper better be good.
[12:10.91]All I'm saying is Wolverine is an X-Man, which means he's a good-hearted person.
[12:14.55]Would he really beat up a little Boy Scout in the first place?
[12:16.71]Would the Boy Scout beat Wolverine up, though?
[12:18.90]Forfeit.
[12:20.77]and just lose.
[12:21.41]This is like Wolverine versus a Boy Scout.
[12:23.98]Why did you pick Boy Scout?
[12:25.58]Because the other option was Bernie Sanders.
[12:28.20]Why did you pick Bernie Sanders?
[12:29.90]Because Bernie Sanders doesn't have any superpowers.
[12:32.08]I thought I was going to get Boy Scout with superpowers.
[12:35.90]Bernie Sanders, he does have one superpower.
[12:38.53]The power of bringing people together.
[12:40.13]I feel like my chat's just going to make you win again.
[12:42.17]Because they don't want to see me win.
[12:44.93]They just don't want to see you win.
[12:46.39]I feel like you're just going to win every time.
[12:50.18]Well, it's rock, paper, scissors.
[12:51.28]Drama beats Star.
[12:52.28]Except not this time, not this time.
[12:54.30]How would I win that?
[12:56.22]You got a superhero.
[12:57.14]I got a kid with a Minecraft sword.
[13:00.76]That's what happened to your Boy Scout.
[13:03.68]That Boy Scout's gone.
[13:04.90]Yeah, popped him.
[13:05.90]Next round.
[13:06.38]Alright, one more round.
[13:08.56]Ready for the final round?
[13:09.50]Yeah, you're ready for one more round.
[13:11.72]Can't you extend this?
[13:13.01]We need a fourth person.
[13:14.41]I'm fucking out of here.
[13:18.48]final final round freaking final round hmm how intriguing adamantium is stronger than diamond yeah well Jerma loves webcam comedy I do
[13:46.88]Webcam comedy is, like, my favorite kind of comedy.
[13:49.24]This is the worst option.
[13:50.34]Everything from that, like, red pack.
[13:52.00]It's, like, mature.
[13:53.00]It's just, like, oh, my God.
[13:55.20]These card packs are fucking embarrassing that we're playing this game.
[14:00.52]Do you think that you could beat a gorilla with power level over 9,000?
[14:05.14]That's all you need to say.
[14:11.84]Your power level is over 9,000.
[14:13.26]Okay.
[14:14.02]Well, too bad that doesn't really matter when we're kung fu fighting on an airplane against a robot.
[14:21.74]You ever seen the androids in Dragon Ball Z?
[14:24.10]They're way stronger than 9,000.
[14:25.50]That's basically what I am right now.
[14:27.93]So I can also hold my breath forever because I'm a robot.
[14:31.57]That kind of goes without saying.
[14:33.27]And I'm wearing a suit of armor over my armor.
[14:35.93]That's just how prepared I am.
[14:37.47]My body's made of armor, but I'm wearing another suit of armor on top of that suit of armor.
[14:42.42]What's a gorilla going to do?
[14:43.74]Just because my power level is over 9,000 doesn't mean it can't be any number higher than 9,000.
[14:48.28]So you saying robots in Dragon Ball Z were stronger than that doesn't mean anything, because I could be infinitely stronger than 9,000.
[14:54.18]So we're on equal footing there.
[14:56.03]Negate at that point.
[14:58.41]I have one of those electric scooters for old people.
[15:00.55]Do you have any weapons?
[15:03.72]We're on an airplane kung fu fighting.
[15:05.35]I would challenge you and say that your electric scooter actually hinders your kung fu capabilities.
[15:10.80]I would argue that you never made it on the airplane because you didn't make it through the metal detector.
[15:18.05]I couldn't get on that plane.
[15:19.39]With your suit of armor, you were double-checked, and the plane has already taken off.
[15:23.29]Yeah, you're a robot, too.
[15:24.42]Hey, we didn't say that this was a plane that the TSA is at the checkpoint.
[15:28.56]This could be a private airplane.
[15:29.86]There's no indication of what type of airplane we're talking about flying on here.
[15:33.81]It's a moot point.
[15:34.63]Well, then it's very clearly my airplane, and I just wouldn't have let you on.
[15:38.95]Alright, let's think for just a second.
[15:41.75]Gorilla.
[15:42.53]Who's a gorilla?
[15:43.51]King Kong is a gorilla.
[15:45.08]Who's a robot?
[15:45.90]You can think of a way cooler robot than King Kong.
[15:48.88]In fact, I'm sure that gorilla also fights robots.
[15:53.00]No, that gorilla is actually Winston, and I made you.
[15:56.71]Oh, Overwatch reference, so you're Overwatch people.
[15:59.87]Hey, now I get the votes.
[16:01.93]Motherfucker.
[16:03.51]Appealing to the inherent likes and dislikes of your audience.
[16:08.15]Over 9,000.
[16:08.61]Meme.
[16:09.43]Vote for the meme.
[16:10.61]Vote for the meme.
[16:12.05]I'm voting for... I'll tell you who I'm voting for.
[16:15.05]I'm voting for the gorilla because robot holding breath underwater doesn't make any sense.
[16:18.53]It's a fucking inanimate created object.
[16:20.51]Doesn't say underwater.
[16:22.03]Alright, look, look, look, look.
[16:23.69]Everyone, too late.
[16:24.75]Too late.
[16:25.41]That's dumb.
[16:26.27]Hold breath forever.
[16:27.71]It's an inanimate man-created object.
[16:30.79]Of course it can.
[16:31.27]That doesn't mean the gorilla wins.
[16:33.25]What if the plane depressurizes, all the oxygen disappears, I live, the gorilla dies.
[16:38.99]You see?
[16:39.83]Fuck, I wish you would have said that.
[16:41.45]Oh, damn, you got roasted.
[16:43.97]Yeah.
[16:44.31]You got wrecked.
[16:45.73]That's because it's, you know, it's the streamer's stream, so.
[16:49.19]Yeah.
[16:50.23]But I lost last time.
[16:51.38]I'm the champion now.
[16:53.06]I'm the comer.
[16:55.36]Okay, let's figure out how to.
[16:57.84]I'm gonna scream before it ends.
[16:59.30]Do we have a timer?
[17:01.05]No, just wait.
[17:01.49]Level up.
[17:07.15]Thanks, guys.
[17:07.69]I know you got my back.
[17:13.50]I don't need these cards.
[17:17.37]I don't need all this shit.
[17:18.89]What do I need with all this shit?
[17:35.19]A webcam humor.
[17:37.53]Dude, I'm such a fat guy.
[17:39.75]My shirt's all like trying to be worn, but look how wrinkly it is because of how fat I am.
[17:47.88]I believe we have to restart the game after every single round.
[17:54.80]That looks like a Snapchat filter.
[18:01.38]Duck face.
[18:03.57]Oh, ready up, you fucking dummy.
[18:06.22]Did I even tweet that we were doing this?
[18:07.78]Fuck, I didn't even.
[18:08.78]No, I just did.
[18:10.38]You're back.
[18:11.14]Why is this not working?
[18:21.99]What?
[18:22.75]You're already up, Etalyx.
[18:24.53]I did, I already clicked it!
[18:25.45]Dumb tweet.
[18:26.44]Oh, your tweet is- you have like, HTTP dot dot dot dot.
[18:31.38]You got an extra dot dot in there.
[18:33.64]Well, I'm just gonna- I'm just gonna fucking retweet.
[18:35.86]I'm better at that.
[18:37.38]How do I- well, let's do a retweet.
[18:39.38]Yeah, that's just- I like how you let someone else do a tweet and then you hit the retweet button.
[18:43.11]Okay, let's fight.
[18:43.71]I'm gonna win again.
[18:46.41]Thanks guys, you got my back.
[18:50.55]Loving these two-round superfights.
[18:53.43]Okay.
[18:54.09]Oh, now I... This is the first time I've had to spectate.
[18:56.17]I'm gonna... I'm gonna sit back.
[18:57.77]Now... Now I get to lose to Jerma.
[19:00.55]I don't... Okay, don't know what that is.
[19:02.23]I don't know what that is.
[19:05.16]Uh... I just did that one.
[19:11.30]Is it... Oh, fuck it.
[19:12.62]Good luck.
[19:13.10]That's all I gotta say is good luck.
[19:15.72]I don't know what this is, but it's the only option I have because the other two are stupid.
[19:20.04]You should go with something that you know what it is.
[19:21.51]I do, but I don't.
[19:23.39]It's too late.
[19:24.41]The other two were guaranteed losses.
[19:26.09]Vote for Etalyx because he actually knows what his cards are.
[19:28.37]Not for me.
[19:29.57]Honestly, the other two were guaranteed losses.
[19:34.00]I don't know what this is.
[19:34.76]I'm going to make it up.
[19:37.30]Alright.
[19:38.28]You guys start.
[19:41.22]I'm a demon.
[19:42.24]Kind of goes without saying, because you can tell.
[19:44.49]I've got laser eyes.
[19:45.45]That's how you know that I'm a demon, with my red laser eyes.
[19:47.91]But more than that, I can summon cats to do my bidding.
[19:51.48]which means you an ornithology.
[19:55.42]I just read your card for the first time.
[19:57.00]I don't even know.
[19:58.32]You're probably allergic to cats.
[19:59.96]You study birds.
[20:01.07]You're good at bird law.
[20:04.89]Okay, so cats eat birds.
[20:07.53]So any birds you might have just lying around are already consumed by me.
[20:11.01]Whatever gets left over, I just shoot with my laser eyes.
[20:13.22]You're also easily winded.
[20:14.98]So while you're chasing my cats around,
[20:18.38]You're gonna just tire yourself out.
[20:19.78]I like to want to argue in favor of Jerma, but it's out of turn.
[20:23.84]No, let him keep going.
[20:25.54]Go.
[20:25.84]You're up.
[20:26.42]Give me what you got.
[20:27.47]Yeah, go.
[20:28.67]Yeah, I might study birds.
[20:30.23]I might just be like a professor at a college.
[20:32.21]Might just be some crazy bird guy.
[20:33.87]Might be easily winded.
[20:35.63]You know, I go up the stairs, go to class, and I teach, and I get winded, but you don't have three dragons.
[20:42.73]You may be right.
[20:44.41]But I am a demon.
[20:45.97]I have ears like a dragon.
[20:48.41]I have a tail like a dragon.
[20:50.11]I have laser eyes, which I think beaten in fire, you might be able to spit out from your mouth.
[20:53.21]Three dragons coming from three different sides.
[20:55.47]Can you imagine that?
[20:56.53]You're fighting this one over here.
[20:57.42]There's like a huge dragon breathing down.
[20:59.22]And then there's like one behind you.
[21:00.14]You're going to shoot the laser beams at the first one.
[21:01.82]The one behind you toasts your back a little.
[21:04.22]Toasts your back just a little.
[21:05.16]I want to help Jerma.
[21:06.58]Your laser eyes have to be turned off.
[21:08.80]All electrical devices are turned off.
[21:11.44]Hey, am I arguing against Jerma or Star right now?
[21:13.54]I don't know which one I'm playing against.
[21:14.72]It's a jar of acid factor.
[21:15.96]There's wildfire down here.
[21:17.40]These aren't just household cats.
[21:19.16]These are saber-toothed tigers.
[21:20.86]These are... You have to turn off your eyes.
[21:23.17]All electronic devices must be turned off.
[21:25.11]Your eyes do not work because those are electronic devices.
[21:28.01]I was a robot last time, Jerma.
[21:29.67]I'm not a robot this time.
[21:30.85]I'm a demon.
[21:31.47]You understand?
[21:32.19]There's no electronics in my laser eyes.
[21:33.53]You have to get that implant somewhere.
[21:35.11]It's not free.
[21:37.34]I'll just dump acid all over your dragons.
[21:39.56]I'll just dump acid on your dragons.
[21:40.92]Done.
[21:41.32]They're in the air.
[21:42.78]Or inside of a factory.
[21:45.49]I think this is an easy Jerm of victory.
[21:49.95]I don't think it's even close.
[21:51.99]That reaction was just like, oh, fuck you.
[21:55.61]No way.
[21:56.17]No way.
[21:57.58]Three pet dragons.
[21:58.36]They're little babies.
[21:59.00]Did you see season one of Game of Thrones?
[22:00.60]Those are the three dragons that you have right there.
[22:02.68]You had that opportunity to make that point.
[22:06.23]Tiny little baby dragons.
[22:07.45]The time is up.
[22:08.73]The time is ended.
[22:11.82]Hey, look.
[22:12.84]Oh, my God.
[22:14.26]Look at that.
[22:15.20]I'm actually surprised.
[22:16.78]My bird guy didn't win.
[22:18.24]A demon.
[22:18.86]Whoa.
[22:20.72]My chat couldn't spell ornithologist.
[22:24.42]Good night.
[22:27.10]Yeah, a demon would have... Because you didn't have to kill the dragons.
[22:30.32]You had to kill the... Yeah, I would have just killed you first with my laser eye.
[22:33.70]Your dragons just would have been there on the sidelines.
[22:35.76]Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[22:37.91]Like Dragonites.
[22:41.61]A Pokémon reference, so popular.
[22:44.47]Oh, they're drawing cards.
[22:45.85]What are they going to get?
[22:46.63]These are awful.
[22:54.53]I got some powerful options.
[22:56.79]Well, can I just concede?
[22:59.42]Can you?
[23:01.24]You gotta buy more card packs to have a better chance of getting over 9,000 power level.
[23:05.60]Yeah, I'm using the basic core set.
[23:07.60]I feel like I'm at a disadvantage already because I can't have my power level over 9,000.
[23:11.08]You're already at a disadvantage.
[23:12.59]I'm going with the power play.
[23:17.63]Somebody said they hate how I look into the camera.
[23:20.31]I like it.
[23:21.31]Yeah, I don't like looking in the camera.
[23:23.59]I'm back on the oil platform, just like every fight.
[23:26.15]And we used to date again.
[23:27.57]And we used to date.
[23:28.67]It's the same thing.
[23:30.93]Guerrilla versus Jesus Christ.
[23:34.07]Well, I guess we're having the evolution debate now, aren't we?
[23:36.82]Some of these cards really are, like, embarrassing that I'm streaming this game.
[23:39.82]I can summon an army of internet trolls.
[23:44.98]That is so dumb.
[23:48.06]Do we even argue this one?
[23:50.03]I think I just win because I'm Jesus and I... Why do you get to be Jesus Christ?
[23:56.93]They gave me the option.
[23:58.93]Ultimate pacifist would never fight.
[24:02.12]Told all of his disciples to lay down their arms when confronted by the other Jews that were about to crucify Jesus.
[24:09.91]Would this Jesus ever fight any living creature created by his heavenly father?
[24:15.39]He wouldn't.
[24:15.83]And that's why our characters used to date.
[24:17.55]And I would say again that this isn't a battle of fists.
[24:20.02]This is a battle of...
[24:22.21]coming together again.
[24:23.55]And I'm convincing the gorilla to come back to me.
[24:26.63]Otherwise, I'll sic my internet trolls on them.
[24:30.77]That's all I have.
[24:32.39]Also, your character's a fucking stuffed animal.
[24:35.53]And you have scissor hands.
[24:36.55]Like, your only weapon is against yourself.
[24:40.21]Oh, I am a stuffed animal.
[24:42.86]That was the random card that was selected.
[24:44.48]But I do have scissor hands, and you're floating down on a parachute.
[24:47.88]Scissors, chop that parachute right up in tiny little bits, and it falls all the way down.
[24:53.65]You're falling so hard that the speed at which the velocity you hit the ground buries you underneath the soil, so you might be, you know, live forever.
[25:02.68]But when you're buried under 10 feet of topsoil, it doesn't really matter.
[25:06.50]There's no topsoil!
[25:07.92]I'm gonna go straight through the oil platform and then walk on water all the way out of there.
[25:14.61]But there's not gonna be any water.
[25:15.65]It's all gonna be oil.
[25:16.83]Also, you're still a stuffed animal.
[25:18.57]You were never alive.
[25:19.93]You stupid.
[25:20.83]Your mother was a bitch.
[25:22.07]I'm gonna have like 5% of the points.
[25:24.75]Just get personal attacks now.
[25:26.36]Like, you were raised wrong.
[25:28.00]Jesus Christ.
[25:29.20]You were raised incorrectly.
[25:31.34]Alright.
[25:33.58]Honestly, Etalyx had a really, really good point there in the very beginning.
[25:39.49]Jesus would never attack.
[25:40.73]Jesus would not.
[25:41.49]Never.
[25:41.87]Never lift a finger against any living creature.
[25:44.86]He would die.
[25:45.64]He would let that victory.
[25:47.20]He would die for them.
[25:48.48]Of course.
[25:49.16]But that's only because everyone knows that he'd win if he wanted to.
[25:53.00]Plus, you're floating down on a parachute.
[25:54.66]Where the hell are you coming from?
[25:56.04]Are you coming from heaven?
[25:56.92]That's a long fucking trip.
[25:59.66]He's a stuffed animal.
[26:00.58]He's not moving.
[26:02.48]You know what heaven is?
[26:04.16]Above the stratosphere.
[26:06.80]Wow.
[26:07.62]What?
[26:07.82]Oh, no, okay, you won, you won, you won.
[26:10.70]Down to hell with you.
[26:12.58]Jesus would be ashamed at how little all 88% of you know him.
[26:16.38]Did you say 88%?
[26:16.96]Is that what it said?
[26:19.00]Yeah.
[26:19.22]Have you guys ever read the damn Bible?
[26:24.98]That's one of Jesus' creations.
[26:26.84]Do me and Jerma even get to go against each other?
[26:30.13]I think it just randomly puts people.
[26:32.61]Winner moves on to the next round, is how it works.
[26:35.20]Jarman's never going to win, so how are we... I've already won like twice!
[26:39.34]Restart your games.
[26:44.72]I don't care.
[26:45.36]I still don't care.
[26:49.30]As long as it's not an oil platform again.
[27:05.31]I think it would be weird if we got like a random dude.
[27:08.70]But maybe that'd be pretty fun.
[27:13.40]I'd have to talk it over with the boys first, you know?
[27:18.38]Has anyone figured out how to make this longer than two rounds?
[27:22.88]What we can do is I can set our lobby to four players and we will get a random person, which is dangerous.
[27:28.61]That is a dangerous proposition.
[27:30.81]That's too dangerous.
[27:32.03]Too dangerous?
[27:32.83]Okay.
[27:34.04]Then ready up, and we'll play one round of this game.
[27:36.50]You could get a guy that would come in and turn and put his asshole in the camera.
[27:39.60]That would be hilarious.
[27:40.16]What is the special deck?
[27:41.46]Yeah, but you'd also get banned.
[27:42.64]I got the hotkeys ready.
[27:44.98]Assholes out of there immediately.
[27:47.42]How do you know?
[27:49.37]Yeah, okay, the guy is like, ready, watch this.
[27:51.35]I'll show you.
[27:51.73]Like, it's easy.
[27:53.29]All he's gonna do is get up like this.
[27:56.69]And then...
[27:58.74]Bang!
[27:59.16]Asshole.
[28:00.58]Bang.
[28:01.54]And it's alright, it's too late.
[28:02.66]So, it's about a day.
[28:05.18]But we're ready.
[28:06.74]I enabled the special deck this time.
[28:08.50]I hope it is living up to its name.
[28:12.81]I mean, you could do... You can do more than one deck.
[28:22.29]I want to go against Jerma.
[28:25.65]I guess I'm going to win anyway.
[28:26.85]Well, you better win.
[28:28.25]Get your screen grabs ready for this.
[28:33.12]I wonder who's going to win this little battle.
[28:36.06]Obviously me.
[28:38.14]I don't think so.
[28:40.82]You've had better cards.
[28:41.88]He's had better arguments.
[28:43.35]I don't know about that.
[28:44.17]I don't think so.
[28:45.61]I would agree.
[28:47.01]But for this round only, I don't want to pick.
[28:50.07]You'll see.
[28:50.99]You'll see.
[28:52.01]Oh, we'll see.
[29:01.22]On an oil platform and we're undead.
[29:08.71]I just want to point out chat that I'm Helen Keller who relies on sonar to see I would like to point out that I am a naked clown that can launch STDs at you.
[29:24.80]And it's a super effective meme.
[29:30.47]I think you're gonna need more of an argument, because Naked Clown is quite powerful.
[29:37.27]I'm done, that's it.
[29:38.92]You're not going to be able to dodge the STG.
[29:41.64]Listen, if what I just said is not enough to convince chat, then nothing else I say will matter.
[29:47.48]Okay.
[29:51.48]Then I will say Helen Keller is going to get a lot of STDs.
[29:55.40]She's not going to see them coming.
[29:56.82]I don't care if you rely on sonar, they're coming too fast.
[30:00.08]Because they're STD RPGs.
[30:02.28]And your literal jazz hands aren't going to be able to stop them.
[30:09.56]You know, you almost had me, but I'm Helen Keller who relies on sonar to see.
[30:15.64]And I have a literal jazz hand.
[30:17.50]I can see my chat right now.
[30:19.97]And you have more arguing you need to do to convince these people.
[30:23.31]Because it's not very much on your side.
[30:25.21]Like I said, if the first car doesn't convince them, nothing will.
[30:29.83]So why should I waste my breath?
[30:34.39]Just sit here quietly, I guess.
[30:39.12]I don't know what to say.
[30:40.74]Naked Clown, I think, would be kind of concerned about his body parts.
[30:44.56]But then again, Helen Keller sonar, that's like some daredevil shit.
[30:50.31]Yeah.
[30:51.35]Pretty much.
[30:51.87]Helen Keller doesn't know kung fu, though.
[30:57.18]What does a naked clown know?
[30:59.12]At least he has a gun.
[31:03.08]It's an effective gun.
[31:04.86]It probably shoots like goo.
[31:06.60]By the way, both of us are undead.
[31:09.50]I didn't want to bring that up.
[31:10.49]I don't think that works in my favor.
[31:15.79]I don't know.
[31:16.63]I really don't fucking know.
[31:17.65]This is the hardest one so far.
[31:23.55]I'm metallic, so my arguments have been way better.
[31:25.85]Let me say the name of my cards and stop talking.
[31:28.14]That's a pretty good argument.
[31:30.64]Fucking idiot.
[31:38.41]Hey!
[31:38.81]Who wins?
[31:40.87]Oh, jeez! 77!
[31:43.78]It was never gonna win.
[31:45.26]Stop voting for the streamer.
[31:46.88]Oh my god.
[31:48.01]It was never gonna win.
[31:49.21]This is so one-sided.
[31:50.31]Don't worry.
[31:51.47]Don't worry.
[31:51.97]Etalyx.
[31:52.43]I'm gonna kick his fucking ass right now.
[31:55.45]If it pairs me and him up, I'm going to... I went to debate school.
[31:58.87]I'll fucking throw it all out there.
[32:00.09]Are you ready?
[32:00.49]My card relies on people knowing who that person is.
[32:04.12]So, that's what I blame.
[32:05.90]Yeah, no.
[32:06.82]My viewers are all like 10.
[32:09.94]Okay.
[32:11.28]You're fucking done.
[32:15.23]Yeah.
[32:16.51]Easy.
[32:19.11]Okay.
[32:23.66]No, this is perfect.
[32:24.72]This is perfect.
[32:26.50]Whatever the fuck you pick, it doesn't matter.
[32:28.18]You automatically lose.
[32:29.46]And I'm punching the mic.
[32:31.34]You automatically lose this one.
[32:32.90]Trust me.
[32:34.45]Go ahead, do your worst.
[32:36.06]You know, you can even go first.
[32:37.94]No, you go first.
[32:38.36]You're going to want to argue this.
[32:39.62]No, you go first.
[32:40.31]No, you go first.
[32:41.35]You go first.
[32:41.91]No, you go first.
[32:42.53]I'm on an airplane.
[32:43.67]All electronic devices must be turned off.
[32:46.65]I'm George W. Bush.
[32:47.47]Oh, look at that.
[32:48.61]Andre the Giant versus George Bush.
[32:53.31]And you're out of mana.
[32:54.63]So you can't do any fucking moves.
[32:57.75]I can call in airstrikes as Andre the Giant.
[33:00.49]It doesn't matter.
[33:01.89]It doesn't matter if you can call on air strikes if we're on an airplane.
[33:04.72]We're not going to get air striked out of the air.
[33:07.28]Take it out!
[33:07.84]Throw it!
[33:08.36]Take that card out!
[33:08.94]Is every fight on an airplane on an oil rig?
[33:11.22]Yes!
[33:11.82]I don't care.
[33:12.88]I was trained by your former master.
[33:14.69]That means the guy that was, like, better than you and smarter than you.
[33:17.73]My dad?
[33:18.83]Yeah, it was your former master.
[33:20.05]You're George W. Bush's George Bush Senior.
[33:23.01]So, like... So, we were both trained by him, theoretically, so we're on equal footing again.
[33:28.55]And I'm out of mana.
[33:30.02]I'm nine feet taller than you, and I'm a professional fucking wrestler.
[33:34.26]Listen.
[33:34.88]You're just a guy with white hair.
[33:36.52]Good luck.
[33:37.08]I'm George W. Bush.
[33:38.25]Yes, I may be out of mana, but that means that I'm desperate.
[33:41.37]That I'll go with any option.
[33:42.59]I have tear gas.
[33:43.87]Hey, how about that war in Iraq, George?
[33:46.20]It doesn't matter right now.
[33:47.24]I just have to beat one person.
[33:48.98]And with my tear gas, Andre the Giant's gonna be crying.
[33:51.96]And I'm gonna take that opportunity to like... Let him drown because of Katrina.
[33:56.75]Andre the Giant is just going to grab your fucking head and just... That's all it's gonna have to take.
[34:05.62]That's it.
[34:08.38]You don't have any superpowers.
[34:09.38]You don't have any mana.
[34:11.65]Shooting tear gas?
[34:12.43]Good luck shooting the tear gas because you're out of mana.
[34:14.17]You can't use that ability.
[34:15.53]The tear gas ability can only be used with a certain amount of mana, which you do not have.
[34:19.33]So sorry, I win by default.
[34:21.61]If all the electronic devices must be turned off, how is Andre the Giant going to operate?
[34:27.32]He's just a person.
[34:28.36]He's a big person.
[34:30.02]Are you kidding me?
[34:30.86]Could you go over the specifics of that?
[34:32.04]He's a big person.
[34:33.88]And in that same sense that your guy, you're also human too.
[34:37.32]You can't be turned on either.
[34:41.57]The dead bodies, they're going to be like, this guy was much better.
[34:43.93]I tried my best.
[34:45.01]I tried.
[34:45.51]This is going to be like 95%.
[34:47.71]I think I set myself up for a little bit of defeat here.
[34:55.84]Out of mana.
[34:57.64]Out of mana.
[34:59.38]I thought of it like he has no options, so he'll do anything to win.
[35:03.53]Yeah, but he needs mana to shoot the tear gas.
[35:05.05]That's, like, one of his moves.
[35:05.67]No, he doesn't.
[35:06.05]He just has... Shit.
[35:09.33]Roadhog's hook is on cooldown.
[35:11.06]Oh, another Overwatch reference.
[35:12.12]Now that we're finalizing votes, and it's too late for it to matter, I just want to point out that Andre the Giant is also dead.
[35:19.42]So, that was an argument that Jerma made against one of your characters earlier.
[35:23.44]So is Wbush.
[35:25.65]They've been faking it for years. 8%.
[35:30.37]That was the biggest victory so far.
[35:32.25]Alright, let's see what cards we won after 10 minutes of play and then restart your games and we'll meet back here.
[35:38.73]We'll do it again.
[35:39.33]Okay.
[35:45.93]Man, I could have had WBush with two extra legs.
[35:55.37]Camera settings.
[35:57.51]What cog?
[35:58.31]Mother... Now it's like stuck.
[36:00.13]No, okay.
[36:02.05]I gotta pick.
[36:03.31]Oh.
[36:04.67]I can't even do that.
[36:12.84]That's just embarrassing.
[36:14.42]Again.
[36:14.68]Oh my god.
[36:15.50]I win again!
[36:16.30]I win again!
[36:18.62]It's another victory!
[36:19.36]I don't think you win again because I have quite powerful options.
[36:26.16]Lazy.
[36:28.21]I went first last time, you go first.
[36:29.89]I go first?
[36:31.33]We're on a rickety old railroad bridge.
[36:34.09]All humans are robots.
[36:36.31]So we're both robots, we're equals there, but I'm a robot version of Mike Tyson.
[36:40.73]Incredible fighter, not dead.
[36:42.68]I have Mjolnir, which is the most powerful weapon in all of Norse mythology.
[36:48.22]Go watch the Avengers.
[36:50.38]The red car.
[36:51.88]And I must have sex with you after I kill you, which is fine because I'm a robot and I really don't mind.
[36:57.07]Do you think Mike Tyson's going to have a problem against a cult leader?
[37:01.88]Hashtag Rubosex.
[37:03.68]Well, hold on.
[37:05.02]I see people jumping to conclusions over there, but they shouldn't be, because a cult leader that's fine might not go toe-to-toe with Mike Tyson, but has gorilla arms.
[37:13.66]Much bigger than Mike Tyson's arms, so even if you're talking about a one percentile for strength versus strength, gorilla arms are way bigger than normal human arms, so they're just always stronger by default.
[37:23.93]And on top of that...
[37:25.73]Excuse me, I'm talking.
[37:28.13]Excuse me.
[37:28.77]I can create a lightning field.
[37:31.83]A lightning field that shocks all enemies within 10 feet.
[37:35.29]Now, correct me if I'm wrong here, but Mike Tyson is made out of 70% water, like most humans are.
[37:41.54]He's a robot.
[37:42.22]We're both robots.
[37:43.58]It doesn't matter.
[37:44.34]That's even worse.
[37:45.14]Steps into my field, gets electrocuted.
[37:46.94]Humans are now robots made out of water, which made the humans... Rebuttal time!
[37:51.86]Go ahead.
[37:52.46]You have gorilla arms, which I'm going to take as the only part of your body that is not robotic is the gorilla arms, which are not human, which means your arms are weaker than my mechanical Mike Tyson arms.
[38:03.77]Secondly, you can create a lightning field.
[38:06.49]Mjolnir is the fucking weapon of lightning.
[38:09.51]I'm going to absorb your lightning and lightning bolt you to the ground with my Norse super weapon.
[38:17.28]Well, unfortunately for you, we're on a rickety old railroad bridge.
[38:20.87]You use that hammer, we're all going down.
[38:23.91]You use that hammer, which you will be so inclined not to use, and we both go down into the deep sea.
[38:28.35]I'm going to put the hammer underneath my feet, and keep pulling it back up, because you can pull Mjolnir towards you, and I'll pretty much fly- Mike Tyson's old!
[38:35.88]That doesn't say Mike Tyson in his prime, that says Mike Tyson, he's like 70!
[38:39.02]Are you guys seriously gonna vote for a cult leader?
[38:43.30]What have cults ever done for you?
[38:44.82]Cults are, like, bad.
[38:46.04]You wouldn't want to vote for, like, oh, yeah, I love cults.
[38:49.27]Oh, yeah, I love cults.
[38:53.29]God has spoken.
[38:54.33]Daleks?
[38:55.98]I gotta go with Mike Tyson here, guys.
[38:58.28]And the reason is, the reason being, you're the cult leader.
[39:01.20]Not one argument that I hear that revolved around who you actually are deep inside using your cult to your advantage could have been a strength, but it was not applied.
[39:08.64]The following with Kevin Bacon, his performance was lackluster.
[39:12.14]Dude, I had gorilla arms and lightning.
[39:13.48]He had a bajon there.
[39:14.16]He can't even use it.
[39:15.34]He's out of mana.
[39:17.38]Your gorilla arms aren't mechanics.
[39:20.28]At least we had sex afterwards.
[39:24.19]Yeah, so much sex, in fact, that the bridge fell down.
[39:27.25]Doesn't matter.
[39:27.75]Had sex.
[39:30.83]Got him.
[39:32.67]Wait, wait, wait.
[39:33.31]We get to keep going?
[39:34.21]Was that the first round?
[39:35.13]That was the first round.
[39:36.17]Now I get to fight against the leader.
[39:38.18]So we're going to actually do it right this time.
[39:40.58]Do it right?
[39:41.10]Dethrone.
[39:42.48]Dethrone.
[39:43.58]Oh, these are awful.
[39:44.36]I lose.
[39:48.16]Oh, these are awful.
[39:49.18]I lose.
[39:51.26]Yeah.
[39:52.49]I mean, these two go together.
[39:54.85]That one is concerning.
[39:56.69]I don't know why you would want that.
[40:05.23]I have nothing to say.
[40:08.18]Besides, I can't wait for this battle of the ages.
[40:11.22]Between two of my friends.
[40:14.44]This one's like too basic.
[40:15.82]I can't argue it.
[40:16.52]Newcomer versus newcomer.
[40:22.16]Million bee swarm.
[40:25.31]On a conveyor belt leading to spinning blades.
[40:31.03]You first.
[40:33.83]Uh, very clearly I can see your boy band.
[40:35.92]I'm a barbarian.
[40:36.98]I can't...
[40:39.19]It'd be pretty easy for one barbarian with an axe to go through, like, NSYNC.
[40:43.43]Can we all agree on that?
[40:44.73]I don't think they'd put in very much of a fight.
[40:46.35]Let me point out that NSYNC here is all wearing a suit of armor.
[40:50.47]That was my random card, by the way, not the one I picked.
[40:53.28]But, what is a barbarian?
[40:55.26]You don't even have anything except laser eyes to fight me.
[40:58.36]And there's at least five of us.
[41:00.10]And we all sing.
[41:01.30]Very loud.
[41:02.84]You think singing and armor is going to stop me from melting your armor around you with my laser eyes?
[41:09.00]See, but we'll be singing so loud, the five of us combined will swell our voices together so that you have to cover your ears in the Berserker Rage.
[41:15.38]See, when you're in the Berserker Rage, your senses are heightened.
[41:18.15]You can hear things better, but that's to your disadvantage this time around.
[41:21.37]No, you can't.
[41:21.75]Berserker Rage, you hear things less.
[41:23.99]Emitting from our vocal cords is going to distract you.
[41:26.91]No.
[41:27.41]When you're in a Berserker Rage, all the sounds around you go away, and your ears, like, all you hear is, like, drums, like war drums going, and you're just killing.
[41:36.37]Alright, but we're on a conveyor belt towards spinning blades.
[41:40.35]You're spinning around.
[41:41.17]You don't know where the blades are.
[41:42.45]The boy band is very aware of where they are on this conveyor belt.
[41:45.32]They're dodging and weaving the blades.
[41:47.94]You're just swinging your arms.
[41:49.98]Your arms are probably cut off already by all the spinning blades.
[41:52.44]A vote for a barbarian is a vote against NSYNC.
[41:58.04]I think you guys are missing something very important.
[42:00.37]There's a million bees around us?
[42:02.35]A million bees.
[42:03.82]Yeah.
[42:04.58]And I'm wearing a suit of armor.
[42:05.80]Protects against all those bees.
[42:08.72]Head to toe.
[42:10.30]Barbarian.
[42:10.96]I think one look around with the laser eyes, all the bees form would be on fire and we'd all die.
[42:16.45]Yeah, but the bees just stay off of your eyes.
[42:18.92]They don't stay off of anywhere.
[42:19.92]You're not shooting yourself with your laser eyes.
[42:23.12]Maybe I am.
[42:24.96]Maybe I did shoot myself.
[42:27.00]And the boy van is winning by default.
[42:28.80]I think actually this is a more even fight than it at first appears.
[42:35.09]But I think I made my case early and I made it strong.
[42:37.37]And you're going to have to restart your game and come back as a loser.
[42:40.84]Well, we're voting.
[42:41.58]I see a lot of boy band coming in here at the end.
[42:44.28]Last minute, last minute boy band supporters because Berserker Barbarian just has to shoot himself with laser eyes to keep all those million, million bees.
[42:53.08]Think about a million.
[42:55.18]Think about how many bees that is.
[42:57.48]They're all angry.
[42:59.28]One bee getting inside your suit of armor, I guess.
[43:01.50]That's unbelievable that the barbarian won.
[43:03.34]Yeah.
[43:04.04]I think I have the streamer advantage.
[43:06.78]A million bees?
[43:08.13]Think about it.
[43:08.79]Think about it.
[43:09.45]This is a very important point.
[43:10.59]There's five of them and one of you.
[43:12.65]A million bees?
[43:13.63]One of those boy band members is probably going to survive.
[43:15.31]Maybe you should have said that two minutes ago, dumbass.
[43:21.30]One bee.
[43:25.66]These other guys are gonna be newcomers.
[43:27.58]I'm gonna use that against them.
[43:30.04]You wait.
[43:30.60]This is the metagame.
[43:32.68]You don't even know the metagame coming.
[43:35.11]I don't.
[43:55.36]What's the metagame?
[43:56.72]What is your secret?
[43:57.92]I'm not gonna tell you.
[43:59.84]Tell me!
[44:00.24]I gotta save it for a tough fight.
[44:02.28]Tell me!
[44:06.34]What?
[44:09.98]I pressed escape to get out of that menu.
[44:12.22]Apparently one too many times because it kicked everybody.
[44:18.12]Fucking idiot.
[44:20.44]Oh, hi.
[44:21.27]Hi.
[44:21.99]Uh, where's Etalyx?
[44:23.09]He dead?
[44:23.79]Ready up!
[44:24.53]Uh, it says he's right there.
[44:25.83]Ready up!
[44:27.47]Ready up!
[44:29.30]Ready up!
[44:31.10]Look at this newcomer not even ready.
[44:38.08]Oh, I'm sittin' out.
[44:42.50]I'm just gonna... Mako's experience!
[44:45.50]It's now, boys!
[44:46.76]Ah, you fuckin' loser!
[44:48.96]You counted!
[44:52.55]Well, I can already tell you who's not experienced is going to have a huge disadvantage in this fight.
[44:57.71]Oh, shit.
[44:59.85]Oh, fuck.
[45:00.73]The card unlocks with a selected experienced.
[45:05.81]Etalyx is going to be tough for you.
[45:07.47]You can go first.
[45:10.31]Well, I feel like that's a disadvantage, actually.
[45:13.59]You'll see in a second why that's a disadvantage.
[45:15.75]He would rather play the video games than be with me.
[45:19.76]Okay, this is an uphill battle right from the get-go.
[45:22.97]Yeah, it is.
[45:23.77]Kitten Stampede, a dungeon full of...
[45:28.49]A hobo armed with nunchucks versus Cthulhu.
[45:32.17]Is the supreme.
[45:33.33]Is the supreme.
[45:36.05]Wow.
[45:36.89]Inside a giant hamster ball.
[45:38.75]I can use that to my advantage though.
[45:40.74]You're stuck in the hamster ball.
[45:42.70]There's a kitten stampede.
[45:44.04]What do kittens love more than playing with little toys that are stuck just out of reach?
[45:48.50]Those kittens are surrounding Cthulhu's hamster ball, pushing you around.
[45:52.32]There's a dungeon full of dragons as well.
[45:55.44]Didn't see that one.
[45:56.46]Probably should have read that before I read it right out loud.
[45:59.92]Give me some time.
[46:01.26]You go, Cthulhu.
[46:02.34]Well, I mean, Cthulhu is like about the size of the state of Rhode Island.
[46:06.61]So, I mean, if he's in a hamster ball, good luck not only to you, unfortunately, not just for you, Etalyx, but the whole planet is going to get crushed by a giant hamster ball Cthulhu.
[46:16.33]So...
[46:17.41]It's not just you, it's not you, it's not just you.
[46:19.81]Alright, so what is Cthulhu known for usually?
[46:22.42]Is it for overpowering acts of God, or is it for slowly driving people insane?
[46:28.86]Now, I'd argue that the hobo is already well-versed in being insane.
[46:33.14]That doesn't really affect him as much as it would your average Joe.
[46:36.89]Especially when you're armed with nunchucks and screams the names of his attacks before he uses them, like judo chop or spinny kick.
[46:44.23]When he screams those out loud, it gives him a certain power that Cthulhu just doesn't possess.
[46:48.96]The power of being immune to something Cthulhu's not used to anyone being immune to.
[46:54.78]And that takes the power away from Cthulhu.
[46:57.53]Cthulhu can't drive him insane.
[46:59.23]Cthulhu's gonna drive himself insane trying to get to this hobo's mind.
[47:06.34]We're talking about Cthulhu.
[47:08.30]He's the size of Rhode Island.
[47:10.00]But everything you just said was real cute.
[47:12.26]But he's going to crush everything and everyone.
[47:15.22]Thanks.
[47:16.00]That's all I've got to say.
[47:17.08]Thanks, Luminosity CEO.
[47:19.93]Who the fuck is that?
[47:20.55]There's also a dungeon full of dragons.
[47:22.55]And I'm in a hamster ball, so I'm protected.
[47:24.17]I can just crawl over all the states and all the countries.
[47:27.85]The kittens are all stray, and they love hobos.
[47:30.33]So they're all on my side.
[47:31.35]I've got an army of kittens on my side.
[47:33.53]Don't let him sway you.
[47:35.92]This is just nonsense talking.
[47:37.92]Cthulhu is the supreme.
[47:40.02]The supreme being.
[47:42.60]Remember Jesus?
[47:45.02]Didn't say the supreme on his card, did he?
[47:48.36]Cthulhu is the supreme.
[47:51.21]That's it.
[47:52.95]Star, what did you vote for?
[47:55.57]I had to vote for the supreme because my experience points rely on it.
[48:00.39]As much as I wanted to believe in the hobo story, like, if it said hobo the supreme, I would have fucking hated for you.
[48:09.20]Hobo the Supreme.
[48:10.88]Okay.
[48:11.70]That would have been so funny if we both had the Supreme.
[48:14.16]If he had Supreme, 100% it was the Hobo.
[48:18.16]I will say that was some A-plus argument.
[48:22.47]You took a piece of straw and made it like a battle axe.
[48:27.03]That was well done.
[48:28.55]That's kind of the tough part with this game is it seems to reward whoever just has the inherently strongest card instead of who makes the most convincing argument.
[48:38.75]Which I would say that I did.
[48:40.93]Proudly.
[48:44.53]You did.
[48:45.71]These are some shit cards.
[48:47.76]Oh, God.
[48:48.24]Who the fuck is that?
[48:50.68]Oh, he did a meme.
[48:51.70]Look, he did a meme card.
[48:57.22]Oh, I don't know anything about that show.
[48:59.17]Oh, shit.
[49:01.39]You got a pick, dude.
[49:02.25]Let's go.
[49:02.83]Okay.
[49:03.51]I had to Google one of mine because I don't know anything about Harry Potter.
[49:08.13]What?
[49:11.75]I don't know who that is.
[49:14.59]Okay, we're in a giant cave and there's a lightning storm.
[49:18.61]Okay.
[49:21.17]You want to start?
[49:22.07]Go ahead.
[49:22.41]I will start.
[49:23.01]Okay, I got a rum full of kindergartners, right?
[49:26.63]Each one of them, by the way, has a golden gun from GoldenEye.
[49:30.13]A golden gun.
[49:31.01]Excuse me?
[49:32.37]There is only one golden gun.
[49:34.37]Okay, well, who...
[49:36.39]Who has the golden gun?
[49:37.70]Obviously the teacher, which would be me.
[49:39.82]I'm holding the golden gun.
[49:41.02]If you don't know what the golden gun does, folks, it kills you in one shot, no matter where you hit anybody.
[49:45.34]So you got two, I got two shots, bang, bang.
[49:47.42]The kindergartners can like swarm you and like bite you and shit while I aim.
[49:50.87]Might hit a couple of kids.
[49:52.21]You know, sometimes I'm just going to be like shooting Randa.
[49:55.05]You know, I might, you'll get killed.
[49:57.47]You'll win.
[49:57.79]Okay.
[49:59.76]I'll accept what you've said.
[50:02.41]The entire classroom has arrows in their knees, though, because you had to pick the meme card.
[50:07.53]Double standard.
[50:08.95]We've established there's only one golden gun, so is there more than one arrow in the knee also?
[50:13.11]I'm going to say the same guy took the arrow in the knee.
[50:15.57]That's Jerma.
[50:16.23]His aiming is going to be a little bit impaired.
[50:18.49]One shot at a time, you have to reload in between, and you're going to have to kill both identical twins, which, by the way...
[50:24.56]are locked inside an antique diver's helmet.
[50:26.70]That antique diver's helmet is going to take at least one of those shots before it even gets to one of the twins.
[50:31.85]And we're wearing one of those cones that they put on pets to keep them from licking themselves, which... How do they have the diver's helmet and the cones on their head at the same time?
[50:39.13]Yeah, that's a contradiction.
[50:40.57]You don't got a room full of, like, savage... Like, it doesn't say that there, but these are, like, savage warriors.
[50:44.90]They're from, like, a savage warrior clan and they're fucking sick at fighting.
[50:48.88]That's who I've taught them.
[50:49.96]I don't remember picking the antique diver.
[50:51.68]I thought I picked something else.
[50:53.52]All that matters is I could just shoot randomly and I would hit two people.
[50:58.55]The golden gun, one hit, I could hit you in the fucking toe.
[51:01.67]You are in a class full of screaming children.
[51:05.35]I'm going to say one of the children took an arrow to the knee, which you are now ignoring, and you're an irresponsible adult.
[51:10.12]Everyone's screaming.
[51:11.62]You tend to them.
[51:12.16]The identical twins have time to come over and slam you over the head with their double headgear head.
[51:17.24]I'd give it medicine, I'd give some band-aid, I'd put it all over it in the kitchen.
[51:20.85]What are you guys saying?
[51:21.67]What were like eight of those words?
[51:23.57]These are superhuman children, you know they don't say that there.
[51:28.75]I want to run that back.
[51:29.97]Alright.
[51:30.91]He's speaking in tongues.
[51:32.05]He's out of his mind.
[51:34.19]Now that the voting's over, I want to say, my opinion, Star, you missed a trick.
[51:38.74]You could have gone with the BioShock reference.
[51:40.56]They could have been little sisters with the big daddies in the antique diver's helmets nearby.
[51:45.72]That would have been a pretty good one to pull.
[51:48.24]I just thought they were regular guys.
[51:50.62]I just wanted them to be regular guys.
[51:52.82]I just got crushed.
[51:53.46]Oh, man.
[51:55.39]I didn't think you're gonna get that badly beaten by my superhuman.
[51:59.25]Oh, by the way, kindergarten class, I could have even mentioned this.
[52:01.33]They weren't even kids.
[52:02.37]They got held back 18 to 19 years.
[52:04.35]They're all like 20.
[52:07.35]I forgot that part.
[52:08.23]They weren't even kids.
[52:09.05]They were just held back.
[52:10.03]They're really dumb, but they weren't children.
[52:13.83]But he's super wins.
[52:15.89]Shit.
[52:16.71]Wow, that triggered the wife even.
[52:24.32]Wife alarm going off.
[52:27.28]Held back for 18 years.
[52:30.32]Like, how do you fail kindergarten?
[52:35.29]Those guys, 18 years old, what?
[52:37.47]They couldn't color between the lines.
[52:40.37]Yeah, they got held back too many years, and I realized that.
[52:45.04]So I trained them to be like warriors, you know?
[52:47.66]Yeah, you trained them in the ways of the golden gun.
[52:50.10]Yeah, I trained them in the ways of the golden gun.
[52:52.34]That's what the class was for.
[52:53.42]It didn't have to be a traditional.
[52:55.85]I guess you're thinking outside the box.
[52:58.35]I need to work on my game.
[52:59.43]Ready?
[52:59.73]Up.
[53:00.53]Rup.
[53:01.19]Rup.
[53:01.89]Count of three.
[53:02.57]Rup.
[53:04.01]I'm rupt.
[53:05.51]I rupted.
[53:12.78]Yeah, Billy Madison was a thing.
[53:15.02]One day, my dream of Etalyx winning will come true.
[53:17.54]That day is this day.
[53:18.16]Hey, everyone, could you please ignore Etalyx?
[53:19.42]Oh, God.
[53:19.56]I hope you're sure as bad as mine are.
[53:22.00]No, mine sucked last time.
[53:47.81]You could go first.
[53:49.43]No, I don't I hate going okay fine fine.
[53:51.67]Let's do it all animals are rabid a dungeon full of dragons By a Spartan versus the Grim Reaper Right you're riding a speeder bike and you shoot lightning But I should ease from my mouth
[54:11.63]So I've just got, you've always seen the Grim Reaper with their mouth wide open, death coming out.
[54:16.21]No, no, I got bees instead.
[54:18.43]So no matter how fast you are on your speeder bike, the bees are always close at your heels behind you.
[54:22.98]But I've also got a skunk on a stick.
[54:24.76]Now the Grim Reaper might not be a person like you or me.
[54:27.86]They still respect the stinky nature of the skunk.
[54:31.10]Everyone does.
[54:32.50]Nobody would get willingly close enough to the skunk on a stick.
[54:36.70]for any close quarters combat to matter.
[54:38.36]And of course the dungeon is full of dragons and all the animals are rabid.
[54:42.62]Dragons can smell that skunk on a stick too.
[54:45.26]They don't want to cook it.
[54:46.00]They don't want to eat it.
[54:46.74]They don't want to fire anywhere near those skunks.
[54:49.37]They're going to direct all their attention to you.
[54:51.49]So I've got the dragons on my side as well.
[54:54.15]You're very good at this.
[54:55.57]You're very good at this.
[54:56.59]I will give you that.
[54:57.21]I'm going to give you some credit where it's due.
[54:58.33]You're very good at this at arguing your point.
[55:01.55]Unfortunately.
[55:02.25]Unfortunately.
[55:14.47]I had to see what would happen.
[55:24.99]What happened?
[55:28.07]I didn't expect you to kick us all in the menu.
[55:30.69]I tried to help Etalyx out.
[55:32.04]Wait for him.
[55:34.84]I was about to take my points.
[55:37.58]I tried to help you, Etalyx.
[55:38.76]I kicked Jerma and it ended the game.
[55:42.49]Yeah, he kicked me.
[55:43.37]Okay.
[55:43.61]We're going to get really saucy for mine.
[55:48.07]I'm going to use my sauciness to my advantage.
[55:50.92]I'm scared.
[55:51.86]Ready?
[55:52.18]I'm scared I'm going to get embroiled in one of my stories.
[55:55.52]I'm just going to get kicked.
[55:56.92]Yeah, he's got that.
[56:02.08]Round one.
[56:04.59]None of Drum was gone.
[56:06.15]Etalyx going to win one.
[56:09.05]Alex has gotten the short end of the stick big time.
[56:14.91]I won by default.
[56:16.13]I got my victory.
[56:17.23]I guess I'll take it and go home now.
[56:21.95]Okay.
[56:24.01]Why would I ever pick that card?
[56:27.75]Why would you ever pick that?
[56:28.43]Hold on a second.
[56:28.91]I got to close my door.
[56:36.03]That's pretty powerful.
[56:37.71]You're going to have to argue your way out of this one.
[56:41.71]Okay.
[56:42.25]We're in Atlantis.
[56:43.57]The million bee swarm again.
[56:45.32]Okay.
[56:52.76]Do what you like to start.
[56:54.18]I could if you don't want to.
[56:55.18]You go ahead and start.
[56:56.26]You set the plan.
[56:56.92]First of all, okay, you get a Japanese schoolgirl on bath salts.
[57:01.62]You might be armed with a can of whoop-ass, but you're probably running into walls and, like, clawing at your own face.
[57:08.24]So, Link, who, by the way, can build sentry guns, so I can just place one.
[57:14.07]By the way, like, I can do that, too.
[57:17.41]But besides that, I can put sentries down, which will vary and deny whatever you're going to go in case you're going to be coming near me.
[57:22.51]And I have a dagger that rewinds time.
[57:24.08]So just in case I happen to be losing the fight, I press the button just like Adam Sandler and click, and there you go.
[57:29.66]I can do the whole thing over again.
[57:31.17]Today I'd like to talk to you about Yandere Simulator.
[57:36.50]Keep going.
[57:37.88]I'm armed.
[57:38.58]I think my one advantage here is I'm armed with a can of whoop-ass.
[57:43.62]Before you even place that sentry turret down, which you have to do, by the way, so it's building at level one, I smash.
[57:50.08]I don't have to build it.
[57:51.29]You're not going to.
[57:51.87]You're not going to get the chance.
[57:52.61]If I pull out the blueprints, I pull out the plans, and I'm looking at the plans, and I'm about to craft it, I see you coming, I drop them.
[57:57.13]I've linked it.
[57:57.84]I don't know how to build a turret.
[57:59.20]Turret's out of the equation.
[58:00.68]Wrecked.
[58:01.40]I'll rewind time before the fight even happens like I'll rewind time before you were fucking even born put the century where I want it 10 years in the future 12 years in the future and then stand there for five with 35 seconds remaining can both of you argue concerning the location and the natural disasters that are going on I would have to say that the bees would ignore the Japanese schoolgirl because how kawaii she is
[58:28.13]Alright, well, if we're underwater in Atlantis, the bees don't go into water.
[58:31.25]Don't you remember that as a kid?
[58:32.53]Atlantis is in a dome!
[58:33.92]Atlantis is in a dome!
[58:35.22]If bees are attacking you, you go in the water and they don't follow you.
[58:38.94]Easy win for Jirba.
[58:41.87]Schoolgirl was born in Atlanta.
[58:43.25]She's in Atlanta's school.
[58:45.78]She has friends that are all trying to help her.
[58:48.64]The coast of Japan.
[58:50.04]Yes, yes, yes.
[58:51.92]Clearly.
[58:53.16]I think the winner is obvious.
[58:54.76]And if I don't win, the stream is ending.
[58:56.86]Vote for me.
[58:59.92]Boogers out of my nose.
[59:01.02]Hold on.
[59:01.50]I'm like Boogaboy right now.
[59:05.08]Things are getting quite dangerous.
[59:09.64]Did I win?
[59:11.60]Alright, Etalyx, let's hear it.
[59:12.62]You're going to have to rewind time back to when this stream was online.
[59:16.82]This is actually a tough one because the bath salts with the can of whoop-ass is pretty big, but Link with a dagger that rewinds time is a little bigger.
[59:28.72]God damn it.
[59:29.64]Let's go.
[59:31.24]Maybe Etalyx will have a chance at winning one.
[59:32.91]Alright, let's see if I get an overpowered build.
[59:37.51]You've got to be kidding me.
[59:39.96]He's giving me like duplicate cards.
[59:42.72]This is what I've already had.
[59:44.42]I don't have all the DLC for this game.
[59:46.35]I don't have deep pockets like these two buying all the DLC packs.
[59:51.27]All I got is the core set.
[59:53.87]They're trying to make me make hobos work.
[59:57.21]You have this.
[59:58.63]I don't have like Cthulhu with like a fucking steroid gun.
[60:02.15]Don't worry.
[60:03.26]Not this time.
[60:05.98]He just infect himself.
[60:09.40]Think of the smell.
[60:11.62]You haven't even thought of the smell.
[60:12.92]Why am I still a newcomer?
[60:15.96]I've won like a dozen fucking games.
[60:18.32]Okay.
[60:22.76]I'll go first.
[60:24.25]10 Willy Wonkas versus every single person at Burning Man.
[60:28.45]How many people go to Burning Man?
[60:30.15]Thousands.
[60:30.75]Thousands of them?
[60:31.49]Thousands.
[60:31.89]And there's a catapult.
[60:34.17]And somebody has a pogo stick.
[60:35.45]I got Willy Wonka.
[60:36.15]All I can do is sing you magical songs.
[60:38.45]You know what?
[60:39.98]All the 10 Willy Wonkas will sing their famous songs.
[60:42.80]All the hippies at Burning Man love Willy Wonka and the classic film that he is from.
[60:48.26]So they're gonna love it.
[60:48.98]They're gonna start dancing.
[60:50.28]They'll start like fucking kissing each other and shit.
[60:52.64]And like Willy Wonka will just like slowly, as you sing in World of Imagination, when they're all tranced, will go around and it'll take like 12 to 20 hours to do it, but he's just gonna stay.
[61:03.22]I got a T-Rex hat.
[61:04.78]People at Burning Man would hesitate.
[61:07.11]But every single person at Burning Man, thousands of people.
[61:11.12]Now I want to point out that I might be armed with one catapult, but I also have unlimited livestock.
[61:16.36]So every single person at Burning Man is mounted.
[61:19.78]Can I just point that out?
[61:20.82]So they are riding their steeds towards Willy Wonka.
[61:24.21]On top of that, one guy's on a pogo stick.
[61:26.03]He's clearly at the front of the pack leading the way.
[61:28.89]Cows aren't very fast anyway, so we take what we can get with the bull riding.
[61:32.79]Everyone at Burning Man would love to ride a bull.
[61:35.33]Have you ever seen Burning Man?
[61:36.61]They look like crazy Mad Max style people with armor and they've got like, yeah, I don't disagree with made cars.
[61:47.48]They're hardy.
[61:48.40]You think they're hippies, but they are hardy people.
[61:50.72]They're in the middle of the desert.
[61:52.82]It's hundreds of degrees out there.
[61:54.98]They can tough out a few Willy Wonkas in a T-Rex head.
[61:57.38]What's a T-Rex head doing?
[61:59.02]and everyone is kung fu fighting how many thousands of people kung fu fighting but how many oompa loompas does one willy wonka own that is true but it doesn't say that they're allowed you know it says it says okay let's say that they are let's say they are for the fun they've got you got all the oompa loompas but I'm so high up on all of my cows that those oompa loompas they just can't reach they'll never reach them ah I think this one might be a loss
[62:27.19]Gene Wilder, you were a great actor, a fantastic comedian, I don't think can take on the entire festival of Burning Man with 10 clones.
[62:35.39]You've got my vote.
[62:37.75]I don't think you argued it well enough, but I know deep down inside that Willy Wonka would win.
[62:43.32]He has the one thing that no one at Burning Man has.
[62:46.04]Money.
[62:49.26]And you think Batman can do with money.
[62:51.40]A couple bucks together in one group?
[62:55.88]I'm actually happy with 32%.
[62:57.87]The votes fucked up.
[63:01.09]They would get the shit kicked out of them.
[63:03.11]Gene Wilder is just like a guy with a funny costume on.
[63:05.87]Congrats, you won one.
[63:07.65]I won, team.
[63:08.79]I finally won with real votes.
[63:11.37]Just kick him.
[63:15.73]He's gone.
[63:17.44]How dare he win?
[63:25.58]Damn.
[63:26.71]I feel like I didn't even get to play that one.
[63:28.67]I just got roasted and toasted.
[63:30.53]I actually have to tell them this.
[63:46.78]Etalyx.
[63:48.38]I appreciate being given the opportunity to display my new title proudly.
[63:53.14]One-time winner.
[63:54.08]Nice job.
[63:55.36]Why am I newcomer?
[63:56.92]You have to change it.
[63:57.90]You're an idiot.
[63:58.50]Listen to you, or you keep food stashed next to the computer because you literally do not want to get up from the computer.
[64:04.40]Go on, interrupt me.
[64:05.20]Subscribers.
[64:07.16]I have two friends lists on Steam.
[64:08.82]You know how you can make the categories.
[64:10.20]One of them is titled Faux Reel.
[64:12.87]Yeah.
[64:13.19]So there's faux real friends, and then there's just regular friends.
[64:15.96]It's really awkward inviting Etalyx every time because he is not a faux real friend.
[64:22.38]Only you can change that, not me.
[64:26.17]Well, water.
[64:26.85]I could use water right now.
[64:31.01]Ready up.
[64:31.27]That was warm and gross, and I didn't like it.
[64:33.37]No.
[64:34.97]You're just going to kick me again and make us maybe...
[64:39.89]I practically cut him off there.
[64:42.03]I have to change him to faux real.
[64:45.07]Change him to a faux real friend.
[64:46.64]I'm doing it.
[64:47.02]Not just a fake real friend.
[64:48.06]I didn't even know.
[64:48.54]What does that even mean?
[64:49.48]I don't know.
[64:49.86]Alright, you two.
[64:51.04]Duke it out.
[64:53.68]Duke it out for our entertainment.
[65:03.21]I forgot that I still had the ha-ha mature stuff is funny things.
[65:09.51]Yeah, you keep like... I want a forfeit.
[65:13.90]What?
[65:14.30]I want a forfeit.
[65:18.06]Well, it can't be worse than what I got.
[65:20.40]It is!
[65:20.92]I don't know about that.
[65:23.75]We'll see.
[65:25.59]It's way worse.
[65:29.26]More spinning blades during a kitten stand.
[65:31.30]See, I'm a huge dick.
[65:32.40]I can only attack your genitals, but I'm walking 12 kids on leashes.
[65:36.60]So I'm a little bit preoccupied.
[65:38.21]I have no genitals.
[65:39.81]I win.
[65:43.53]I'm a car.
[65:44.83]Can only attack genitals.
[65:46.63]I don't have any.
[65:47.43]I'm a car.
[65:48.11]What more do you want?
[65:55.99]Go.
[66:04.40]Turn these back on.
[66:16.39]I'm sorry, I don't want to talk about how my huge dick is walking children.
[66:22.40]I can't debate it.
[66:23.32]We all know what's going to happen.
[66:24.20]We're just going to sit there for two minutes.
[66:29.04]I thought I had a strategy.
[66:31.13]He went on a three-week video game bender that cost him his health, job, and wife.
[66:37.41]It doesn't make any sense.
[66:39.08]There's no reason for it.
[66:43.01]I don't encourage that on my stream here.
[66:45.23]We're gonna have to redo.
[66:46.49]This fucking picture is like huge.
[66:49.67]Like, guy in a dick costume.
[66:52.88]Ugh, what a fucking, what a fucking controversial game this is.
[66:56.94]Let's press F4, ready up.
[66:59.12]I'm glad that there's no setting to extend the game length because we can't make it past one round as it is anyway, so.
[67:05.99]Fucking god, that was so- There's like options on top.
[67:08.29]Do you see how there are options on top?
[67:11.25]But I can't change those.
[67:15.66]Maybe we have to not be ready.
[67:17.10]Let me re-invite you.
[67:18.34]Yeah, I'm ready, Jorma.
[67:23.86]I can't fucking stop.
[67:30.50]I can only pick players here.
[67:37.59]They're all grayed out.
[67:40.93]The cog doesn't do anything!
[67:45.49]Jesus Christus.
[67:49.41]Okay, you guys have fun with your, like, fun game.
[67:55.51]I'll just, like, you know, go to the grocery store.
[67:58.39]Bye.
[67:58.69]Fuck you.
[68:01.11]What, he's gone?
[68:02.17]Good.
[68:02.55]Fuck him.
[68:03.43]Okay.
[68:04.23]Maybe if we didn't end the game every single round?
[68:07.76]I don't really...
[68:19.02]Alright.
[68:23.08]Pretty decent.
[68:24.20]No, this just became really awkward.
[68:28.08]This just became really awkward.
[68:30.29]You did it.
[68:31.15]Why?
[68:32.25]You'll see.
[68:33.47]Sandstorm.
[68:34.81]You are not armed with a harpoon gun.
[68:41.66]Yeah, you don't have any arms.
[68:44.82]How are you going to shoot the harpoon gun?
[68:48.08]especially modified angel.
[68:51.19]Instead of arms, I have harpoon guns, you see?
[68:54.03]So I don't have to hold it.
[68:55.23]They're built into my angel persona.
[68:59.63]Four out of seven dwarves.
[69:02.47]Level 90.
[69:03.71]These are dwarves obviously from the World of Warcraft.
[69:07.34]So level 90, that's not a level cap, but still pretty damn good.
[69:11.02]Can take on the likes of Ragnaros and still win.
[69:13.94]I don't see why an angel would be so difficult when gods can be beaten by level 90 dwarves.
[69:18.82]And we can breathe underwater, so no matter where you want to fight us, good luck.
[69:23.33]And we're in a giant cave.
[69:25.13]And we're small.
[69:25.87]You gotta find us too.
[69:26.88]One of them's gonna hide.
[69:28.04]I'm gonna specifically make one of these seven dwarves, or four dwarves, sorry, let me correct my statement.
[69:32.26]One of the four dwarves is gonna be hiding in this giant cave.
[69:35.34]And there's a sandstorm.
[69:36.28]Good luck finding him.
[69:37.19]Remember in Warcraft 3 when you'd build one farm somewhere to make it so you would never lose the game because they'd have to kill every building?
[69:44.80]Case in point.
[69:45.68]That sucked.
[69:46.34]I'm an angel.
[69:46.90]I got connections.
[69:49.04]I can call down some help if I need to.
[69:51.84]I got powers on high.
[69:53.87]both the godly and the angelic variety.
[69:56.39]I know that you've got four dwarves, but I see that you're not armed with anything in particular, except your small stature.
[70:01.68]You can breathe underwater, but there's just a sandstorm inside of this cave, which is gonna make it a bit difficult for those four dwarves to find me when I'm flying with my angel wings through the sandstorm.
[70:12.30]With a harpoon gun, I can shoot you from range.
[70:15.50]Harpoon guns instead of arms can be beneficial under the right circumstances, and I think these are those circumstances.
[70:22.20]Well, you mentioned calling somebody, and how are you going to call somebody on a telephone without hands?
[70:27.28]You have Siri.
[70:28.48]There's a spiritual connection there.
[70:30.42]You don't have an iPhone.
[70:31.74]Sorry, you have a Android.
[70:35.98]Wow, that really put the nail in the coffin.
[70:40.75]You don't even have time to rebuttal.
[70:42.21]They explain that you don't need phones.
[70:43.81]I know.
[70:44.13]I don't even have time.
[70:46.15]There's no reception down here anyway.
[70:47.67]It's a cave.
[70:48.41]During Sandstorm.
[70:50.50]no arms this should have presidential debates are done this is how you decide who's going to be president there's how many times they win in this game the question isn't if I'm going to lose it's how many percentage points I'm going to lose by it's hard to beat four level 90s it kind of is but you know
[71:12.52]that high to be expected to be expected it's the no arms that was the random draw I got no arms if you if you had arms lose 10 out of 10 times I would lose every single other time if that was if you actually were allowed to have arms without a doubt some of the random cards are amazing and some of them are build killing next round alright geez god
[71:40.72]I could set you guys loose at any time.
[71:43.28]I could set you on fire.
[71:53.29]Okay, good luck.
[71:56.69]You fucking done, dude.
[71:58.71]You lose.
[72:00.19]That's it.
[72:01.51]No more.
[72:02.20]You stole fizzy lifting drinks.
[72:04.14]That whole Willy Wonka quote that I can't quote because I don't remember.
[72:07.14]My random card makes me win.
[72:09.68]Oh, does it really?
[72:10.46]Yes, it does.
[72:11.98]Okay.
[72:12.54]We're in a jungle and the floor is lava.
[72:17.06]Tell me why you're so- you're gonna win?
[72:19.35]First of all, okay, Zeus, the god of all gods.
[72:23.23]This isn't Jesus, this is not Cthulhu, this isn't a Criken.
[72:27.35]This is the god of all fucking gods.
[72:30.97]Not only that, I had an hour to set up the battlefield before you even got there.
[72:35.79]I can put fucking traps, I can make sure it's exactly to my advantage, and I have diamond fucking armor on.
[72:41.34]Hit me all you want, Criken, you'll bounce right off.
[72:46.22]Even the God of Gods was afraid of the Criken.
[72:49.68]Did you see that movie recently?
[72:50.78]What was it, um, uh, Night in Quest?
[72:53.13]What was that movie?
[72:54.17]Even Zeus couldn't fight the Criken.
[72:56.61]It had to be left to mortals because Zeus was fucking scared.
[72:59.63]And I have that giant eagle from Lord of the Rings that could just solve my problem.
[73:02.89]So I could just ask the giant eagle to come help me in this fight.
[73:06.99]What happens in the end of that movie?
[73:08.96]What movie?
[73:10.04]What happens in the end?
[73:10.78]What happens to the Criken?
[73:12.48]Does the Criken win the fight against the great gods?
[73:15.76]Yeah.
[73:17.64]Or does the Criken die in a pit of his own blood?
[73:20.98]Did Zeus himself defeat the Criken?
[73:25.23]Zeus is still alive in the end of that movie.
[73:28.51]Floor is lava, by the way.
[73:30.05]Floor is lava.
[73:31.35]We're in a jungle.
[73:32.17]Go.
[73:32.95]We're in a jungle and floor is lava.
[73:34.20]I got diamond armor on and I'm Zeus.
[73:35.64]You're going to be like, your tentacles are going to be like burning.
[73:37.64]Hey, you ever play Minecraft and you drop your diamonds in the water and then the diamonds melt?
[73:42.12]Diamonds don't matter in jungle.
[73:43.56]I'm cracking.
[73:46.09]Fucking do this shit.
[73:47.39]Alright, so first of all the Criken is I'll get yeah come over and fight me in the fucking lava floor That's fine.
[73:54.82]I'll take the fucking extra crispy calamari when it's all said and done Crispy calamari you think I'll take the calamari I'll eat I'm dangerous.
[74:04.70]You know I'm flying on top of that eagle.
[74:06.57]That's cleaning up my whole big enough to feed the seven kingdoms I'll have an hour to prepare and once you do you just fucking jacked off
[74:20.41]I could do that and be fine.
[74:22.79]I could jerk off for three hours and still win.
[74:26.66]Can you?
[74:27.32]I don't know.
[74:32.52]Probably not.
[74:34.46]This got a real PG-13 stream, huh?
[74:38.05]I was fighting words at the end, I'm sorry, I got a little heated.
[74:40.73]Oh, by the way, you guys drunk.
[74:42.67]I forgot to say that, didn't even need to.
[74:45.13]How much alcohol is necessary for a Criken to get drunk?
[74:48.19]Well, you know when people get drunk, they're better fighters.
[74:51.25]Oh, sometimes.
[74:58.01]I think my best arguments were made at the end, and that's my fault.
[75:02.24]I just don't think you beat Zeus wearing diamond armor.
[75:04.90]No matter who the fuck you are, you're not gonna win.
[75:08.97]And I had an hour to, you know, do what I would do.
[75:12.27]Yeah, do what he does.
[75:19.70]I wish I'd stop unlocking things.
[75:21.58]Like I fucking bought the game already.
[75:24.64]I bought card packs too.
[75:27.86]Took me up, man.
[75:31.82]I have some incentive to play.
[75:33.10]We're all hamsters and wheels.
[75:34.90]Life isn't real.
[75:38.99]salty he's a salty streamer Zeus should have won 100 Zeus made his like wasn't it his like half bastard son killed the Criken for him because he was too much of a little wimp to do it it doesn't matter that that still means he would have won
[75:59.03]Yeah, you brought up the movie thing, and that was your downfall, because he dies in that.
[76:02.81]No, the Criken does die, but not to Zeus.
[76:05.74]It doesn't matter.
[76:06.38]You should have brought up a movie where the Criken wins in the end.
[76:10.32]Like the Criken movie part one.
[76:12.42]Criken the movie.
[76:16.64]That was your own damn... There's just salt in my chat.
[76:29.22]This is the lining up.
[76:30.08]Alright, you two.
[76:34.84]Go at it.
[76:36.08]Be nice, though.
[76:37.05]Be nice.
[76:38.33]Don't be angry.
[76:39.67]I need the DLC, man.
[76:41.27]I need the DLC bad.
[76:42.39]I think the DLC for these picks is hurting me.
[76:45.47]They have taken away all of my good options.
[76:49.77]I lose no matter what.
[76:52.35]There's not a winning choice here.
[76:55.73]Oh, now I win.
[76:56.81]It's the random card that you get that, like, really, really opens up options.
[77:01.53]I'm done.
[77:02.80]I mean, I can't pull straws from this one.
[77:05.62]Italic's not looking too confident.
[77:08.00]Coming into the Neverland Ranch, where my non-stop erection is really going to help.
[77:14.94]Electric Eel, go ahead.
[77:16.26]Tell me what you got.
[77:18.89]I'm an Electric Eel.
[77:21.78]You're the ghost of Osama Bin Laden with a painful erection for five hours.
[77:27.76]And you're armed with the Master Sword.
[77:30.20]Can you hold the Master Sword as a ghost?
[77:31.82]Yeah.
[77:32.04]How does that work?
[77:34.76]I'm armed with it already.
[77:36.12]It doesn't say I have to pick it up.
[77:37.30]Is it a ghostly sword?
[77:37.88]I'm already armed with it.
[77:38.94]Yeah, it's a ghostly sword.
[77:39.86]It's ethereal.
[77:41.84]It's made for my needs.
[77:44.01]Alright.
[77:44.31]Well, okay, okay, okay.
[77:45.23]I have many needs.
[77:46.09]Osama Bin Laden, you're already dead.
[77:49.17]So you've been shot by many of the SEAL Team 6.
[77:52.39]You already lost once in life.
[77:54.61]Losing again in death seems like it comes to you naturally.
[77:57.81]And there is a tornado.
[78:00.33]There is Neverland Ranch here, and there's a lot of children, presumably, spinning around in this tornado.
[78:05.61]Some of them have a ghost.
[78:08.75]You're swirling around in that tornado, too.
[78:10.33]Since I'm an electric eel, I don't worry about whether I'm underwater or above water, because I can hold my breath forever, no matter what.
[78:17.48]So I think that you're getting pretty much stuck in the tornado walls.
[78:21.14]If you're going to ask if my master sword can be affected by a ghost, okay, fine.
[78:25.57]I can't even pick up the master sword.
[78:26.87]That's because I'm not affected by anything in the mortal realm.
[78:28.79]Do you know what it is?
[78:29.69]Electric eels.
[78:30.54]The tornado will kill you eventually.
[78:33.20]I'm a ghost.
[78:33.80]I'm just sitting watching.
[78:38.27]So if you can't affect anything in the mortal realm, then you can't kill me, because you can't interact with anything in the mortal realm.
[78:43.68]That just makes me immune to you automatically.
[78:46.42]So all I have to do is survive a tornado at Neverland Ranch.
[78:49.68]And you have to survive Neverland Ranch.
[78:52.92]Okay, but the tornado at Neverland Ranch, there's a lot of, like, giant blow-up slides and other kid-related things.
[79:01.23]I'm hitting that way too hard, but I would just land softly on one of those and be fine.
[79:08.00]I think that one of, like, the security forces or the janitors or the special forces or whatever that work there would see an electric eel slithering around and kill you afterwards if the tornado didn't already get you.
[79:20.35]Can I just say if my other two options were either picking the horde of Burning Man people again, or my other option was a fainting goat.
[79:29.70]So... I... Well... I'm a ghost.
[79:34.92]I, uh...
[79:36.47]I had to go with the Ghost of Osama Bin Laden only for one reason, Etalyx.
[79:41.58]Because I was going to say the ghost can't affect anything, like you said, in the mortal realm.
[79:46.34]But, you know, armed with the Master Sword, it would just cut you.
[79:49.84]And you'd be done as the Master Sword.
[79:51.18]Remember that?
[79:51.79]Remember The Legend of Zelda?
[79:53.19]I remember The Legend of Zelda.
[79:55.31]I didn't have a whole lot of options there.
[79:56.41]That was the only variable.
[79:57.49]That's the only reason why I picked it.
[79:59.05]Read about it in the Bible.
[80:01.05]I did what I could with the cards I was dealt.
[80:04.38]And you did well.
[80:05.44]You did well.
[80:06.52]I got 13%.
[80:08.48]Pity votes.
[80:10.48]You fought well.
[80:12.06]I fought.
[80:14.63]What?
[80:15.09]Someone says the hashtag in your stream is now hashtag Bin Laden.
[80:18.61]Congratulations.
[80:20.37]Jesus.
[80:21.59]Yeah, I guess I lose.
[80:23.69]I'm going to take a... I don't know how this is going to work.
[80:30.48]I got to pick a nicer one to make up for it.
[80:39.65]Alrighty.
[80:41.61]My keyboard, like, broke.
[80:45.83]You broke it.
[80:46.71]Don't blame anybody else but yourself.
[80:48.95]I think it pulled out of the computer.
[80:55.04]Baby Gandhi?
[80:57.26]Baby Gandhi.
[80:58.48]Is a super genius.
[81:00.34]Oh, the super genius versus the entire country of Canada.
[81:05.35]And they're all armed with bajon here.
[81:07.43]In a hot air balloon.
[81:08.97]We're all in a hot air balloon.
[81:10.03]We're just ready to crash down on you.
[81:12.91]I would say that super genius gandhi would find a way to disable the hot air balloon and send Canada crashing down into the Earth and destroying the whole planet that okay that's fine okay let's just let's just say that super genius baby gandhi drops the whole hot air balloon with the entire population of Canada down into the Earth right yeah some of those people are going to be cushions for other people
[81:34.06]Right?
[81:34.50]We're talking about millions of people.
[81:36.14]Some of those like millions of people that like end up at the squash stack on the bottom are going to be pillows for the next person above.
[81:41.59]And like maybe some of them fall on Gandhi, perhaps?
[81:44.49]Some of them might even fall on you.
[81:45.47]We're talking about like millions of people.
[81:47.01]I'm a super genius.
[81:47.88]I would have planned on that.
[81:49.90]Then the super genius would take the water balloon down.
[81:52.46]Would take the hot air balloon down and have to deal with like one or two million angry.
[81:58.57]I'm gonna take a different angle then.
[81:59.93]I'm Gandhi.
[82:00.99]I speak for peace.
[82:02.43]That's all that I know.
[82:04.64]Um...
[82:06.02]I'm riding a unicorn apparently as well, I didn't even see that, but we're also in a factory, which I don't even know how Canada fits in there, you're probably already all dirty.
[82:12.28]I guess the hot air balloon can't be that high up if you're inside of a factory.
[82:15.84]That's even better for me.
[82:17.12]So I'm gonna go to Canada, because Canada's having a problem, and I'm gonna talk diplomacy, I'm gonna talk peace, and I'm gonna figure out how to solve your hot air balloon problem, and the prime ministers, all the people of Canada will praise Gandhi for the intelligent super baby that he is.
[82:31.10]And I think I will win that way, not through violence, but through diplomacy.
[82:35.53]Well, I would argue with that.
[82:36.59]Excuse me!
[82:37.39]Excuse me!
[82:38.37]Excuse me!
[82:39.32]Excuse me!
[82:39.96]Excuse me!
[82:40.66]Excuse me!
[82:41.24]Hey, excuse me!
[82:41.98]Gandhi would excuse me!
[82:43.02]Excuse me!
[82:44.32]Excuse me!
[82:45.72]I've pissed off a couple Canadians in my life, and whoa, baby, you don't want to do that very more than once.
[82:50.68]I'm not pissing them off.
[82:51.50]I'm fucking Gandhi.
[82:52.40]I just thought it was going to be nice to you.
[82:53.74]Like, you walked in, and you're like, oh, I'm going to solve all your problems.
[82:56.14]I'm like, we don't have any fucking problems.
[82:57.42]Canada.
[82:57.78]Canada, like, fuck you.
[82:58.81]Who do you think you are coming in here?
[83:00.23]We have, like, a fucking parliament that does all laws.
[83:02.27]We don't need Gandhi coming in here.
[83:03.51]We're all stuck in a nasty factory.
[83:05.85]And they have Mjolnir in like a fucking fire extinguisher glass.
[83:09.62]There's someone that's just to break it and just smash you.
[83:13.30]I think this one might be close.
[83:17.48]Closer than it should be when Canada has the legendary hammer.
[83:21.90]Yeah, Canada has the legendary hammer.
[83:25.90]Oh, it was close though.
[83:27.00]It was kind of close.
[83:29.48]Well, have fun.
[83:30.40]I'm going to go to the grocery store again.
[83:33.70]Canada.
[83:34.43]I went with Gandhi.
[83:36.83]Because he always drops nukes in Civilization, so he seems kind of like the fighting type, especially if he's a super genius.
[83:43.00]Yeah.
[83:45.42]I think I just nuked Canada.
[83:47.92]Let me get that crown on my head.
[83:51.44]Hold on, let me get the shitty crown.
[83:54.92]I got the golden crown.
[83:57.08]Fucking losers.
[84:01.34]I'm gonna cheat this time, guys.
[84:02.50]I have a strategy where I will have, like, a super-powered...
[84:08.15]Everything that I get is going to be super powerful.
[84:14.29]Now how do you do that?
[84:16.39]You untick everything that isn't the orange deck.
[84:26.41]The worst part about starting a new lobby every single time is getting repeat cards.
[84:30.77]Game crash.
[84:32.29]Oh.
[84:33.69]You're going to have to re-invite me in a minute.
[84:40.22]Waiting for Jerma.
[84:44.21]Such a lowlife cheating thug.
[84:46.35]It's called a strategy, not a cheat.
[84:59.44]Nah, nah.
[85:04.91]I had a game crash.
[85:06.41]Okay, ready up.
[85:07.27]Rup, rup, rup.
[85:09.03]We're waiting for Etalyx.
[85:10.13]Etalyx is here.
[85:10.83]He's just being a turd.
[85:12.57]Oh, what a dumbass.
[85:17.34]Round one.
[85:21.06]You're a turd.
[85:21.90]You're a turd.
[85:25.96]What?
[85:29.28]Oh, I got this one in the bag.
[85:43.39]That hurt me to see that card flip at the end.
[85:45.91]Again.
[85:46.31]I have no arms.
[86:01.73]Is this Cards Against Humanity or is this like the monster fighting game?
[86:06.20]Alright, so you are a porn monster, okay.
[86:10.85]You have a chainsaw but you don't have any arms.
[86:12.79]Versus rat movie.
[86:14.08]Guess what I have.
[86:16.36]The giant rat.
[86:18.11]Might be clumsy.
[86:19.27]He's wearing a red shirt because he likes red.
[86:21.41]Giant rat.
[86:22.64]They're the strongest of all beings in this whole galaxy.
[86:25.62]The first thing I have to set clear.
[86:27.60]First thing I have to set clear right now.
[86:30.04]Excuse me.
[86:31.46]Tentacles aren't arms.
[86:33.64]Would you say an octopus has eight arms?
[86:36.87]They have eight arms?
[86:37.81]Or is that a spider?
[86:39.53]Octopuses don't have arms.
[86:41.45]So a tentacle porn monster doesn't have arms.
[86:43.81]I'm going to set the record straight right there.
[86:45.27]I still have the chainsaw.
[86:46.45]I still have my tentacles.
[86:48.20]How is he going to use a chainsaw?
[86:49.74]You need to grab it with hands.
[86:52.08]Fine.
[86:52.72]Have you ever watched fucking hentai in the tentacle loses?
[86:56.15]Have you ever seen the tentacle lose?
[86:57.87]Have you ever seen the girl go, oh, I'm powerful now?
[87:00.57]No.
[87:01.21]Your rodent is getting raped.
[87:04.91]We went there.
[87:05.45]We just went there.
[87:07.13]What's your rebuttal, Jerma?
[87:08.27]Oh, you're not going to be wearing that red shirt for long.
[87:11.68]What are sea mines?
[87:13.20]Well...
[87:15.02]Uh, I have to hear a gross, gross disgusting statement.
[87:18.76]I would just tell you that, uh... My true statement, that you can't face facts.
[87:21.92]Looks like my opponent's trying to dance around the facts.
[87:24.06]Giant rat, giant rat always wins.
[87:26.71]Have you seen the two movies?
[87:28.25]They always win, they always fight evil.
[87:29.57]Not a single person who watches me has seen a rat movie.
[87:32.81]Oh yeah?
[87:34.63]I would argue, okay, I'd argue that 50% of people have it, and that 50% is gonna put me in favor.
[87:41.77]I don't think so.
[87:42.81]Because who watches good original content on YouTube?
[87:45.36]Plus, sea mines, a wind tunnel, how are you going to function in there?
[87:47.62]The giant rat can just eat cheese in the corner while you fly through a wind tunnel.
[87:51.32]You're done.
[87:52.32]That's it.
[87:52.98]You lose.
[87:54.02]I got a red shirt on.
[87:55.30]You can't even see me when I'm red.
[87:58.24]That's how the Tyrannosaurus monster works.
[88:00.10]You're also really clumsy.
[88:02.10]You're just probably going to chainsaw yourself the way the rats are.
[88:10.83]Let's find out.
[88:16.16]I don't even know.
[88:17.72]Alright, Etalyx.
[88:18.52]What do you got?
[88:19.88]I gotta go with the Japanese tentacle.
[88:22.03]No!
[88:22.91]Etalyx as a man who's seen enough hentai to know that they don't lose.
[88:26.53]Fuck these two!
[88:28.76]My viewing history has told me that the tentacle always wins.
[88:32.16]Oh, what the fuck?
[88:33.62]I'm surprised that there's 38% on the rest.
[88:36.03]You two are disgusting.
[88:37.43]Fucking, give me a break.
[88:39.35]Giant rat would have just fucking bit him in his fucking tentacle.
[88:41.75]I don't care who you picked, you're not beating the tentacle monster.
[88:44.15]Yeah, you will, well, yeah, okay.
[88:47.78]You better hope I don't get it again.
[88:50.12]Undefeated.
[88:50.64]You two, you two fucking degenerates.
[88:56.56]Oh, not to mention the giant rat, like, dies twice.
[89:00.67]He gets replaced every time.
[89:02.29]Not to mention the giant rat was actually just, like, a kid playing with toys.
[89:07.27]He's fucking no talent.
[89:08.45]He's clumsy.
[89:09.72]Hey, don't give away story points.
[89:26.66]Alright.
[89:27.72]Going good.
[89:28.46]Your turn to go first.
[89:29.94]Oh, damn.
[89:37.46]Forrest Gump versus MacGyver.
[89:39.43]Forrest Gump.
[89:39.89]I also have a depressed Centaur on my side, who is a man of his own.
[89:44.09]Centaur is, of course, having human bodies, so that's pretty much two versus one already.
[89:48.75]And I'm armed with a crowbar, which already, I'd say, put me at a pretty good advantage.
[89:54.61]You, go ahead.
[89:55.15]Go ahead.
[89:56.52]Alright, well, I'm MacGyver with a robotic exoskeleton, and my entire body is very sticky, so that crowbar that you're armed with, I just grab it, and the sticky exoskeleton just sticks to it, and I disarm you from the get-go.
[90:10.05]So, Forrest Gump, what is he known for?
[90:12.47]Run, Forrest, run?
[90:13.59]Riding a depressed centaur?
[90:14.93]Not really giving you the running advantage here.
[90:17.27]We're also in the Vatican at 100 degrees below freezing, so my robotic exoskeleton isn't one of those normal exposed ones.
[90:23.92]I'm immune to that 100 degrees below freezing because the exoskeleton is insulated.
[90:28.22]It has its own heating system.
[90:29.96]You're just riding a same car.
[90:31.16]You're both frozen solid.
[90:33.56]Look at the face!
[90:34.18]Forrest Gump is not known for running.
[90:36.14]He's known for walking into miraculous experiences in life.
[90:41.51]And they all always seem to go in his favor, don't they?
[90:43.61]Everything always worked out for Forrest Gump.
[90:45.87]So yeah, he's in the Vatican.
[90:46.95]Yeah, it's freezing.
[90:47.59]It's below freezing, but he's figured out him and his centaur are wearing enough clothing to not be affected by this.
[90:53.55]Sounds like you're describing something MacGyver might come up with, perhaps.
[90:57.30]Uh, you know, always ready.
[90:59.16]Excuse me!
[91:00.02]Excuse me!
[91:01.16]Excuse me!
[91:02.18]I wasn't done.
[91:07.21]Alright.
[91:10.76]I guess you were, actually.
[91:12.28]I guess you were done.
[91:13.20]I mean, if his entire body is- NO, LISTEN!
[91:17.62]MY STICKY BODY WENT RIGHT UP THE WALLS!
[91:20.20]I'M ON THE ROOF OF THE VATICAN!
[91:22.42]You can't even get me from there with your depressed- IF YOUR BODY IS STICKY, I'M JUST GONNA PUSH YOU OVER ONCE AND YOU'RE GONNA TURN INTO A FUCKING SNOWBALL AND ROLL ALL THE WAY DOWN THE HILL AND YOU'RE JUST GONNA KEEP GETTING SNOW STUCK ALL OVER YOU AND YOU'RE JUST GONNA ROLL AWAY.
[91:32.63]NO, BECAUSE IF YOU PUSH ME, YOU TOUCH ME, AND IF YOU TOUCH ME, THEN YOU'RE STUCK TO ME NOW, AND THEN I JUST WRAP YOU UP IN A BEAR HUG UNTIL YOU DIE.
[91:40.51]We're both dead, whatever.
[91:42.63]Forrest Gump was the best movie ever made.
[91:47.16]I think I give points to Etalyx because you said Forrest Gump was not known for running.
[91:51.81]What an incorrect statement that was.
[91:55.03]I voted for MacGyver.
[91:56.81]It was more than just running, okay?
[91:58.57]MacGyver can do anything.
[92:00.49]You put like a paperclip and a fucking wheel of cheese in front of MacGyver and he's gonna make it happen.
[92:04.76]Forrest Gump.
[92:05.94]He's got a whole exoskeleton, not just a paperclip.
[92:07.90]Forrest Gump learned to be like a top table tennis player in like a weekend.
[92:11.42]He can learn shit.
[92:14.44]No longer am I just the one-time winner.
[92:17.23]Can't start in the game fast enough before I go any further.
[92:21.81]Wait, oh, no, you don't have to be Jerma.
[92:24.03]Fuck you.
[92:24.81]Oh!
[92:29.77]They wouldn't listen.
[92:31.69]YOU GUYS WOULDN'T LISTEN.
[92:33.09]God damn it.
[92:41.14]I would've won if I picked the golden gun.
[92:42.68]I didn't need it.
[92:43.22]I didn't think I needed it.
[92:56.67]Hey, listen.
[92:58.69]I'm really impressed that you talked through my yelling, by the way.
[93:05.17]I thought you would have stopped, but you just kept going.
[93:07.57]Okay, Jerm, you gotta ready up.
[93:09.72]You just kept going.
[93:16.90]Fight.
[93:20.99]Ooh, Jerma Etalyx going at it.
[93:24.79]I really wish... It kind of, like, gimps you, because we're trying to avoid picking cards that have already been picked, so sometimes there's only, like, one option.
[93:36.26]Well, mine's fucking dumb, but I've got a guy that's pretty strong.
[93:42.92]I have to pray for the card that gets flipped.
[93:45.18]Jerma, have you been, like, drinking in between rounds?
[93:47.67]Yeah.
[93:47.81]Yeah.
[93:49.57]Coffee coffee, I don't even have any left.
[93:53.56]I'm just I'm foe drinking this coffee It sounds so bad no good super fight
[94:11.84]Are you guys really into fonts?
[94:14.56]Yes, he is.
[94:15.86]Who cares?
[94:16.44]It was either that or made of paper.
[94:19.09]Oh, okay, good.
[94:20.47]I'd rather be into fonts.
[94:22.17]Alright, well, first of all, I'm the manticore.
[94:25.03]I'm a fucking monster.
[94:26.67]Huge.
[94:28.27]I'm covering up my genitals with my towel.
[94:30.73]I'm a very...
[94:32.62]I'm concerned with people, how they perceive me.
[94:34.74]So I'm covering up my genitals with that towel.
[94:37.16]Make sure nobody sees.
[94:37.84]Let me stop you right there.
[94:40.10]Because you have literal jazz hands.
[94:42.52]So you are jazz handing with lightsabers.
[94:44.90]That's unstable.
[94:46.11]You don't know where those lightsabers are going to swing.
[94:48.53]They could cut into yourself perhaps and give me an opportunity armed with catarangs.
[94:54.15]Can we take a second to identify what exactly is a catarang?
[94:57.69]Is it a boomerang made of a cat?
[95:00.59]I believe it is.
[95:01.82]Okay.
[95:03.20]But you are a mad scientist, and you're talking about how clumsy I'll be.
[95:06.99]Mad scientists are known for ruining their projects and having multiple failures, and I can see you messing this up big time.
[95:14.69]You'll maybe take a lightsaber, try to turn it into something else, and actually make a poison that gets into your bloodstream.
[95:20.70]Alright, but you see, look.
[95:23.16]I'm really into fonts.
[95:24.30]I've been into fonts for a long time.
[95:25.66]I know which ones are free, I know which ones cost money, I know which ones are the premiums, and I know which ones are in.
[95:30.61]And the Army, the Navy, they've employed me to design the fonts for their new aircraft carriers, which we just happen to be on.
[95:37.33]And on that aircraft carrier, I know the top dog.
[95:41.05]I can send any of these planes on this deck to shoot you down at any given time.
[95:46.18]That's what getting into fonts gets you, kids.
[95:49.16]So start from an early age.
[95:50.68]Learn the difference between Helvetica and Ariel.
[95:52.82]Learn the difference between Times New Roman and Comic Sans.
[95:55.06]When should you use Comic Sans, though?
[95:58.99]He said you could use Comic Sans.
[96:00.63]That's an automatic loss.
[96:02.94]I said learn the difference.
[96:04.20]I didn't say you could use it.
[96:05.44]I heard use.
[96:06.52]I heard use.
[96:07.02]I don't know about you guys.
[96:07.72]I heard use.
[96:08.16]That's what I said.
[96:08.68]Run that tape back.
[96:09.44]I think I heard use.
[96:10.26]I heard use.
[96:10.72]Manticore covering up his genitals with a towel and he's got jazz.
[96:13.89]Not to mention your Manticore is easily distracted by my catarang bait that I'm throwing at you.
[96:19.21]So you're taking little snips, little bites of cats as they fly by.
[96:22.79]Well, I come in there and slice with the lightsaber.
[96:26.39]Yeah, you'll slice and you'll miss.
[96:28.57]And I'll grab your hand and go, Sputy human, I'm the Manticore.
[96:33.37]We'll see.
[96:35.77]I think I got a pretty strong case.
[96:38.60]At least I've used all my cards.
[96:40.80]We still have Has a Towel.
[96:42.02]I haven't heard that identified yet.
[96:43.66]You didn't even use one of his three cards.
[96:45.90]Covering up my genitals.
[96:46.94]That's what it was there for, because I'm an appropriate person.
[96:49.44]I'm an appropriate one.
[96:50.92]Well, if you're covering up your genitals, then how are you wielding lightsabers?
[96:54.20]Because it's wrapped around and tied.
[96:55.95]You know what I mean?
[96:56.79]It's wrapped around, tied, and secure.
[96:59.43]By the time you swing at me, it's a big towel.
[97:00.99]You might hit the towel, and then everyone's going to see.
[97:05.00]I don't think you want them to see that, and you'll be fighting.
[97:08.62]I won.
[97:09.10]Oh.
[97:10.35]You're still going.
[97:13.89]I was still going.
[97:14.71]I'm still arguing.
[97:20.97]I don't know who this counts as.
[97:25.67]Okay.
[97:26.07]I feel good about this.
[97:28.37]Sure.
[97:30.01]Oh, I feel good about this.
[97:32.08]I don't have any of those to get in the way.
[97:33.34]Judgmental versus experienced.
[97:36.96]Watch it, you guys.
[97:38.12]I'm experienced.
[97:39.92]More hot air balloons into the wind tunnel.
[97:42.84]One super fight.
[97:44.92]Okay.
[97:46.04]Well, first of all, I'm gonna say this is Leonardo of the Minja Tur- Minja Turtles!
[97:50.93]The Ninja Turtles fame, Leonardo.
[97:53.07]Obviously has extreme fighting capabilities.
[97:55.81]He's in a mech suit, and if he holds his breath, time stops.
[97:59.39]So, it doesn't matter how big your guy is, all I'd have to do is go like this.
[98:08.37]And you're dead.
[98:09.37]Even while time has stopped, my sumo wrestler has to pee so bad that I will squirt in Leonardo's face the moment I'm punched.
[98:17.50]You'll stop holding your breath, and I think that will even the fight.
[98:21.64]He's in a mech.
[98:22.91]That'll hit you.
[98:23.67]Oh, D.Va Online.
[98:25.07]You didn't play D.Va in that game, Overwatch?
[98:26.93]Oh, gosh.
[98:27.16]So it's going to hit the front of the mech, and she still... She can still move around and shoot.
[98:32.26]It's a mech.
[98:33.62]You don't think that a mech is going to fall through the bottom of a hot air balloon?
[98:37.62]Piss on me.
[98:38.30]Piss it.
[98:38.72]Piss in my face.
[98:39.76]Do it.
[98:40.12]I'm fine.
[98:40.76]I can hold my breath.
[98:41.94]The second I start to smell some pee, I can just...
[98:44.79]Boink.
[98:45.19]And you know what?
[98:45.79]I can hold my breath.
[98:46.95]Maybe I'll go walk around you and really humiliate you.
[98:50.31]I'll drop your trousers and then I'll fucking knock you in the head with a fucking bowling pin and I'll win.
[98:56.81]I'll pants you.
[98:57.97]I'll pants you.
[98:58.49]And then you know what?
[99:00.06]I'm going to take my breath.
[99:02.26]You're going to be like, somebody pants me.
[99:03.56]And then I'm going to hold my breath again, pull him back up.
[99:06.06]I'll let you get in a second if you realize that you don't know what the fuck's going on.
[99:08.92]Who's pantsing me?
[99:09.86]Boink, bowling pin.
[99:10.96]Boink, dead.
[99:11.82]Buried six feet up.
[99:12.68]I was going to argue.
[99:15.10]But I didn't realize how comfortable you were with taking my pants off so I could pee in your face.
[99:20.24]Like, my one thing that I had going for me was like, if I really have to pee, maybe I could use this as an event.
[99:25.22]I don't have any legs to get in the way.
[99:27.34]I'll just, like, pee free.
[99:29.13]He likes it.
[99:30.71]No, that's how confident I am.
[99:31.77]Your one superpower is meaningless to me.
[99:33.61]My one superpower of having to pee.
[99:37.11]Yeah, really having to pee.
[99:38.27]I could care less.
[99:39.73]I mean, we're in a wind tunnel.
[99:40.95]It's gonna go, like, everywhere.
[99:44.95]I don't care.
[99:45.53]You'll freeze time and collect all the drops.
[99:47.91]Yeah, I'll freeze time and just walk around.
[99:49.44]I can hold my breath for about 60 seconds.
[99:51.14]That's enough time to walk around and hit you in the head.
[99:54.40]More than once.
[99:55.68]Oh, Jerma wins.
[100:01.38]Woohoo!
[100:02.64]This takes a long time for what we already know has happened.
[100:05.59]Like, the game probably already knows it's like 99% to 1.
[100:07.45]It's supposed to count.
[100:10.97]Everybody's vote counts.
[100:12.89]It doesn't.
[100:18.32]I like how the sumo wrestler has no legs.
[100:20.78]Yeah.
[100:21.14]It's like one of his main defense mechanisms just ripped out from under him.
[100:27.30]I didn't get any good options.
[100:30.36]I feel you.
[100:31.42]I know.
[100:32.62]I'm cheating.
[100:35.83]You see that the orange ones are always like references to like Leonardo in a mech were his orange ones?
[100:44.05]I'm going to annihilate these shitties.
[100:51.85]I'm going to unravel their existence.
[100:53.99]I hope you guys are ready to lose, because I've got the fucking winning game strategy.
[101:00.65]I guess I'm sitting out again.
[101:11.11]Yeah, what's up with you sitting out?
[101:14.48]They're giving me time to catch my breath.
[101:18.11]I think that's an instant one if I click that, but I don't want to go there on you.
[101:21.25]No, go for it.
[101:23.76]Get the instant one.
[101:26.84]I dare you.
[101:27.56]I double dog dare you.
[101:37.95]I double fucking dare you.
[101:45.03]So winner is chosen by a sword fight here in a cage match.
[101:48.56]So you have to win in a sword fight.
[101:50.56]It says in the supreme.
[101:53.22]Is the supreme, that's fine.
[101:55.22]I'm Loki, the god of all mischief.
[101:56.78]By the way, I can also call in like Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom style.
[102:01.39]You know, hit the call button, Bloody Mary comes from behind.
[102:03.89]Bang!
[102:04.27]She's here, she's screaming in your face.
[102:06.09]You're looking in the mirror, you know, she's my alternate, you know what I mean?
[102:08.55]I got two characters here, not just one, two.
[102:10.73]Bloody Mary's involved.
[102:11.95]Also, some would consider a powerful god.
[102:14.79]Leroy Jenkins is a guy that screamed in an internet video.
[102:17.31]But he is the supreme.
[102:20.60]You're also gonna have to put your spears down because the winner is chosen by a sword fight while we're in a cage match.
[102:25.74]Who is known to have a sword?
[102:27.36]Maybe Leroy Jenkins, perhaps?
[102:28.72]What does Loki use?
[102:30.02]I am stealth.
[102:31.63]Daggers.
[102:32.31]You know, you need a... You're referencing the Smite character, Loki, by the way.
[102:37.87]God Loki, not like Smite.
[102:40.81]Even Marvel Loki.
[102:42.45]When did he ever use a sword?
[102:45.03]So, I can summon, good.
[102:46.71]Loki can summon Bloody Mary and then just die.
[102:49.96]Bloody Mary doesn't have to have a weapon.
[102:51.60]You know the story of Bloody Mary, right?
[102:53.08]If Bloody Mary wins, that doesn't mean Loki wins.
[102:57.24]Why not?
[102:57.94]And then Loki's going to have to defeat Bloody Mary, and I don't think he can do that.
[103:02.35]Yo, by the way, you're also dying.
[103:03.73]You are already dying of dysentery.
[103:05.85]How long does it take you to die from dysentery?
[103:08.27]Oh, talking about stealth.
[103:09.41]I could just be stealthed until you die from your diarrhea.
[103:12.40]Go ahead, come find me.
[103:13.52]Come scream into a bunch of whelps, and I'll just, like, go stealth.
[103:16.14]Do you honestly think the Supreme would die of dysentery?
[103:20.71]What happens to Leroy Jenkins in the story?
[103:23.91]He kills everybody.
[103:24.67]He wipes the whole raid.
[103:25.39]You're going to run in and wipe your whole... Even if you have the whole raid, you're going to wipe them.
[103:29.69]That's what he does.
[103:31.03]He goes into things without thinking.
[103:34.23]And dying of dysentery to me sounds like... I think Leroy Jenkins going crazy and swinging his sword everywhere where you're trying to hide of stealth.
[103:40.88]I think he's going to cut you once and I'm going to win that sword fight.
[103:43.64]Loki is not known for sword fighting.
[103:45.42]Bloody Mary's in the mirror.
[103:46.52]You can't even fight her.
[103:47.42]There's no mirrors in the cage.
[103:48.80]Yeah.
[103:51.08]How does Bloody Mary get summoned?
[103:52.18]It's gotta be a mirror somewhere.
[103:54.62]Yeah, like your fucking purse.
[103:59.98]Because you're a Nancy and you brought a purse instead of a sword to a sword fight.
[104:03.79]I'll take 70%, please.
[104:05.09]Roll the dice.
[104:09.59]Damn it.
[104:10.67]What do you say?
[104:12.47]I went with Loki.
[104:13.93]I mean, he's hiding.
[104:14.95]He's the trickster.
[104:15.93]He's the god of deception.
[104:18.60]Throwing spears at you while you're not looking.
[104:20.54]But I'm the supreme!
[104:21.88]Yeah, but that's... Your face!
[104:24.88]The supreme what?
[104:26.42]The supreme pizza?
[104:27.64]Oh, cast blizzard!
[104:30.80]That's bull... That's fucking bullshit.
[104:32.74]That's no... There's no way that you just want to buy that much.
[104:35.16]I... Give me a fucking break.
[104:40.32]Holy shit.
[104:41.04]Were the people that were voting for Loki sleeping?
[104:44.78]They couldn't spell Loki.
[104:47.22]They kept putting season.
[104:48.84]I just didn't get it.
[104:50.20]38%.
[104:50.40]Two gods.
[104:51.24]Two fucking horror movie characters versus a guy that screamed in an internet video.
[104:55.36]Congratulations.
[104:55.88]He's an internet god.
[105:00.69]He's an internet god.
[105:02.85]That's good.
[105:06.01]Home stream advantage.
[105:08.55]Dude, this is like cheating.
[105:12.69]I selected only the orange deck, and all of the orange cards are bullshit.
[105:16.59]I have the option to pick Zeus with a diamond sword.
[105:18.92]And I'm not even gonna take that, and I'm still gonna beat you.
[105:22.04]Wow, this guy's even exploiting to win video games.
[105:26.22]I told you I was going to annihilate you guys.
[105:30.22]And we lost too many in a row.
[105:33.14]How are you going to go up against... Here, let me hit you with this first.
[105:37.86]As they flip the cards.
[105:39.44]You're gonna have to go up against Kirk.
[105:41.79]legendary character commanding the Enterprise and he's on a good day.
[105:50.01]He's Jason.
[105:50.45]Kirk commanding the Enterprise?
[105:52.20]Well, I've got 10 Jasons here that would like to say hello, past lover Kirk.
[105:58.32]We're back.
[105:59.14]We're on the Enterprise with you, but you won't see us coming because we always appear right behind you when you least expect it with the sword going right through your back.
[106:09.63]I also have a mustache that can stretch and move at will!
[106:14.65]It's true!
[106:15.39]When have you ever seen Kirk lose a fight?
[106:18.56]There's always some way where they come up with a plan, and on a super effective, on a good day, there's no way that Kirk won't be able to think his way out of the situation.
[106:27.06]He's gonna come up with some science theory about how he can melt the mustaches and make them wrap around all of the Jasons.
[106:33.53]You say Kirk never lost.
[106:34.99]Does Jason ever lose?
[106:37.10]Yeah, he's dead.
[106:38.66]He's only Jason because he's dead.
[106:41.44]Also, I would like to argue that there are ten of us, by the way.
[106:44.61]There are ten of us, and we're on the Enterprise right now.
[106:48.21]Excuse me.
[106:49.09]Okay?
[106:49.29]Excuse me.
[106:49.93]What do you do?
[106:50.63]Hey, tone it down, you two.
[106:51.81]This is a family stream.
[106:54.61]You're gonna set your phaser to stun for ten Jason Voorhees?
[106:58.51]I don't think so.
[106:59.31]Oh, you said the key word, Jason Voorhees.
[107:01.31]I don't see that on your card because there are more Jasons in this world than there is just regular people named Jason.
[107:07.05]The odds of you getting Jason Voorhees is extremely low.
[107:10.47]Your name is Kirk.
[107:12.05]There's tons of people named Kirk.
[107:14.29]So it's just a random dumb Kirk commanding the Enterprise.
[107:18.00]He doesn't know what those buttons do.
[107:19.22]Well, he's moving sliders up and down.
[107:20.96]He's pushing buttons.
[107:21.90]He's looking at screens.
[107:22.90]He doesn't know what to do.
[107:23.70]He's asking the Ewok for help and he has the whole crew.
[107:26.32]The crew is still there.
[107:30.37]So even if I, even like some random Jason or like the actual crew of the Enterprise, the real Kirk's probably there guiding his hand.
[107:37.65]Oh, that doesn't say there's a crew on the Enterprise.
[107:39.57]It says that this is guiding Kirk.
[107:41.17]It's super effective though.
[107:43.18]Kirk must know how to command the Enterprise if it's that effective.
[107:45.80]Ten random Jasons versus one random Kirk.
[107:48.26]I'll take the ten Jasons any day of the week.
[107:51.15]It's stupid if you think that you're going to win this fight.
[107:54.11]Star, you fucked yourself so bad.
[107:55.97]How did I fuck myself?
[107:56.99]When you said that it could just be any Jason, it could just be any Kirk, and there's 10 just regular potential Jasons versus one random Kirk.
[108:04.57]He's good at commanding the Enterprise either way.
[108:07.11]Jason, any random Jason isn't good at commanding his mustache.
[108:13.29]Still 10 of them.
[108:14.39]You gave me the look.
[108:15.17]Still 10 of them.
[108:16.09]I'll take the odds that one of those guys is good at it.
[108:19.88]What the fuck?
[108:21.30]No way.
[108:23.06]Wow.
[108:23.74]I made a reference to a thing people know about.
[108:26.54]Cheated.
[108:26.88]Cheated.
[108:28.11]Down to hell.
[108:29.75]No way.
[108:31.09]No way.
[108:33.43]Got him.
[108:40.65]Me and those Ewoks are going to destroy you guys.
[108:49.13]listen also what bullshit bullshit how is that bullshit bullshit bullshit get the chant going bullshit bullshit 74 percent of people didn't think it was bullshit oh yeah how many alt accounts you got going here star
[109:19.13]Yeah.
[109:20.17]How many alt accounts we got?
[109:21.95]How many, uh, new bots do we got going here?
[109:26.73]I'll take- I'll win again.
[109:30.59]I'll win again!
[109:31.19]Alright.
[109:37.12]Oh yeah, you guys go at it first and I'll come in and clean up the winner.
[109:40.88]Can I just say how stupid it is that they're trying to get me to pick Jason again?
[109:44.95]Jason.
[109:45.57]There could just be any Jason.
[109:47.33]There's no other arguments that I could possibly make that I haven't already made.
[109:51.09]Oh, God.
[109:51.63]I got this one again.
[109:52.65]I just win.
[109:53.61]Fuck.
[109:55.13]All three of my other cards have already... Well, no.
[109:57.48]Two of them have been picked.
[109:59.46]Tone it down for him, Jerma.
[110:00.72]Be nice.
[110:01.56]I'll tone it down.
[110:02.26]Come on, Darren.
[110:03.40]I did.
[110:03.86]I did.
[110:04.36]There was like one or two options that were just ridiculous.
[110:06.82]And I picked the one that might not be totally ridiculous.
[110:13.40]I don't think I can pull this needle out of a haystack.
[110:16.46]Let's see.
[110:17.85]What does the internet have to do with this?
[110:19.87]The internet?
[110:20.73]That's where the fight's taking place.
[110:23.27]Well, I'm a super genius and I have the entirety of the internet at my disposal to win this fight.
[110:28.41]So I know all the hot spots.
[110:29.57]I know how to go to the dark net.
[110:30.79]I know who to call.
[110:31.51]I know who to talk to to get the job done.
[110:34.41]You're armed with the one ring.
[110:35.89]How does that help you on the internet?
[110:36.91]Jeremiah used my cheat.
[110:39.07]Well, you see the thing.
[110:39.97]No, I didn't.
[110:40.31]I swear to God.
[110:41.69]So what I could do is I could just inhale the mime, press down on the D-pad, and then get the super genius as well.
[110:47.53]And then I'd have the one ring and the dagger that reminds time.
[110:49.75]So I'd be just as smart as you with much better weapons.
[110:52.79]But we're on the internet.
[110:54.23]So it doesn't work quite like that, unfortunately.
[110:56.73]You don't have the physical capabilities to absorb me.
[111:00.19]The mime just mimics you.
[111:01.73]So I just look like Kirby.
[111:02.95]So it's Kirby versus Kirby right now.
[111:05.91]But who is more popular on the internet?
[111:08.01]Some random mime or Kirby the most beloved franchise?
[111:12.63]You're not part of this.
[111:13.48]Shut up.
[111:15.09]I think we're underestimating the fact that the mime is a super genius here.
[111:18.83]That needs to be taken into consideration.
[111:20.95]As am I now after I've swallowed you.
[111:22.55]And since we used to date, since we used to date, I know what makes you tick, Kirby.
[111:28.17]I know exactly what makes you upset and what makes you the happiest.
[111:33.07]I'm going to lull you into that false sense of security based on the knowledge of the inner workings of your relationship, your mind.
[111:41.51]I'm going to twist those strings with my super genius.
[111:45.21]You've lost me.
[111:46.31]There's three references to soccer culture on this.
[111:49.44]We walk into each other.
[111:50.64]I rewind time.
[111:51.44]I don't even date you.
[111:52.22]I realize the mistake that I made to date you, Mime, of all people.
[111:55.36]This is not a dagger that can rewind to the beginning of time.
[111:58.06]Why not?
[111:59.08]There's no limitations there.
[112:00.21]That's your video game deck, isn't it?
[112:02.39]That's a Prince of Persia dagger that rewinds time, isn't it?
[112:05.73]And that's got a very specific limit on how far you can go backwards.
[112:10.07]I just put the one ring on and I've got the ring race will just come down and just slaughter you.
[112:13.66]A mime.
[112:14.52]Oh, okay.
[112:15.40]Cool, I'm in a box.
[112:16.38]I'm in a box Kirby.
[112:16.96]Hey, you've got the one ring.
[112:17.82]It doesn't work like that.
[112:18.82]The ring race come to you.
[112:20.00]They come to kill you.
[112:20.86]You're the one wearing the one ring.
[112:22.59]So the ring race are on my side.
[112:24.09]I'll take it off.
[112:24.81]I'll take it off and throw it at you.
[112:26.51]I know this character's name.
[112:27.87]I vote that character.
[112:31.59]I remember Kirby when Yarn Kirby.
[112:34.77]Remember Yarn Kirby?
[112:36.07]Yarn game.
[112:36.87]I love that game.
[112:38.01]That's my favorite.
[112:39.27]Yarn epic game.
[112:40.25]Remember the pink Kirby?
[112:42.05]Yeah.
[112:43.33]I like Smash Bros.
[112:44.69]I'm an idiot.
[112:47.28]Jesus.
[112:49.00]Whoa.
[112:49.32]Whoa.
[112:51.84]I am just... Did I win?
[112:53.70]69.
[112:53.72]69% now.
[113:00.87]Sorry, Etalyx.
[113:02.19]Super genius would win every time on the internet.
[113:04.61]On the internet.
[113:05.63]You heard his argument?
[113:07.76]You hear what he said about Kirby?
[113:10.12]I know that character and he's like cool and cute and fluffy.
[113:13.12]It's okay.
[113:13.60]I'm not... I'm used to it.
[113:15.90]You see, I'm a one-time winner.
[113:17.29]I'm okay with that one time.
[113:19.23]He's extra fluffy.
[113:21.29]He's extra fluffy.
[113:22.75]Okay, turning on slash subscribe.
[113:26.23]He's extra fluffy.
[113:28.75]Now that's me versus Jerma.
[113:29.97]Sub mode only.
[113:31.81]No Jerma fans allowed.
[113:36.61]Oh, okay.
[113:41.33]Oh, boy.
[113:42.93]This is a smart one.
[113:44.31]This is a smarty.
[113:45.24]I got a smart one here for you.
[113:48.12]Can't wait to give you my rebuttal to whatever fucking lame-ass excuse you have for a character.
[113:53.54]Might as well just exit the game now, Star, like you typically do in fashion of you and your characters.
[113:59.70]I don't even need my body.
[114:01.82]Judgmental.
[114:03.36]Everyone vote for Star.
[114:04.68]Experienced.
[114:05.74]No, you fucking...
[114:08.04]Alright, we're in prison, and we're full of- the place is full of lions.
[114:11.30]60 year old stripper, paralyzed from the eyes.
[114:16.77]Alright, I got a 10 story tall hummingbird.
[114:21.13]In prison.
[114:22.77]Dude, I have a hummingbird.
[114:24.55]First of all, I want to say, if a hummingbird bats its wings... 10 stories tall.
[114:30.12]Yeah, it's like 10 million RPM.
[114:31.88]It's like... You've seen those videos of the fucking Discovery Channel where it shows just how fast they're flapping?
[114:36.50]10 stories tall.
[114:38.04]If he's doing that, it doesn't matter what you're doing.
[114:41.15]It's going to be like Sonic waves everywhere.
[114:43.11]And plus, your guy's fucking paralyzed and he's 60 years old.
[114:46.95]I think he's losing against a giant fucking, gigantic hummingbird that's ready to go into the first.
[114:51.96]I openly and willingly admit with 100% certainty that the hummingbird would defeat the stripper in a fight.
[115:02.44]He's playing the con.
[115:03.42]He's playing the short, long con.
[115:05.37]So you're admitting defeat.
[115:08.25]So that means...
[115:10.03]That means that you just lose, right?
[115:12.35]No, I don't think there's any conceivable way that I could win.
[115:15.02]I mean, there's possibilities.
[115:18.38]The speedster bike could really change things.
[115:21.38]No, not at all.
[115:22.40]Not at all.
[115:22.66]I'm sorry, but no, there is not one, there is a 0% chance you win this.
[115:26.46]The only way you win this is if for some reason in the prison, the building like collapses and it closes.
[115:31.85]Well, you know what's in the prison is a, it's full of starving lions.
[115:36.63]You know who they're going to attack last?
[115:38.41]They're going to think I'm dead.
[115:39.87]I'm not moving at all.
[115:41.53]A giant hummingbird?
[115:43.19]Food for a month!
[115:44.69]Food for a month!
[115:47.30]It took a minute and a half for a convincing argument to come out of the 60-year-old stripper, but I think we may have found one.
[115:53.66]That's a free meal.
[115:54.56]They're gonna walk by you and just eat you first because you're like an appetizer.
[115:57.42]You have to go to fucking Fridays and order like the fucking mozzarella sticks.
[116:00.69]I'm slunked down in the bike.
[116:02.53]They won't even see me.
[116:03.41]The giant bird, first thing they see.
[116:05.81]The bird might even eat you.
[116:06.85]The bird might eat you.
[116:08.34]Now the bird doesn't even know who the enemy is when there's that many lions.
[116:10.62]You're gonna have to, like, find me.
[116:13.02]I've already made my arguments.
[116:14.08]You've already admitted defeat.
[116:16.08]Your arguments suck.
[116:19.48]Oh, yeah?
[116:19.92]Hummingbird ten stories tall?
[116:21.38]Sonic waves?
[116:22.62]Please.
[116:23.18]You've seen those videos.
[116:24.18]We've all seen them.
[116:26.28]What did you... Etalyx.
[116:28.90]I went with the 60-year-old stripper.
[116:33.08]The play dead argument is what sold me.
[116:35.30]The fuck did you just say?
[116:36.84]You're surrounded by hungry lions and they think that you're dead.
[116:39.80]So they're not, they're not, they're going for the live meal, pumping full of blood.
[116:42.92]They're all jumping on the 10 story tall hummingbird.
[116:45.38]Who's, who's by the way, inside of a prison.
[116:47.06]And it's really cramped in there.
[116:48.68]Like you might be able to swing a thousand times a minute, but you're stuck.
[116:51.56]Your wings can't move.
[116:54.25]Also, I was hedging my bets because I was watching chat.
[116:56.77]So I wanted to vote for the winning one.
[117:01.42]How the fuck did you win by that high of a percent?
[117:03.10]You cheated.
[117:03.44]Yeah, he did cheat.
[117:04.94]He cheated.
[117:05.66]He told everybody to do that.
[117:07.12]Yeah.
[117:08.74]He made it a love-only vote and said no one vote for Jerma.
[117:12.63]Oh, you really did that?
[117:13.83]Yeah.
[117:16.17]You picked the worst possible cards to LOL.
[117:18.05]Oh, LOL.
[117:18.27]Thanks, guys.
[117:27.16]Thanks for my safety net, my safe zone here in my stream.
[117:31.28]Now you guys can vote again.
[117:37.81]Real life has low self esteem, socially very awkward, but yet in the game they become a great warrior.
[117:55.05]You think you know somebody.
[117:56.67]How many more of these do you want to lose, by the way?
[117:58.19]I've actually been playing for like two hours.
[118:00.71]I'm having fun.
[118:01.71]I'm having a good time.
[118:04.65]I don't dislike my time in this game.
[118:06.09]I want to buy the other packs, but I feel like I'm getting conned because they're $5 each.
[118:11.62]You are getting conned.
[118:12.70]That's a huge con.
[118:15.96]It's like a $10 game that comes with like
[118:20.62]Less than 100 cards.
[118:22.12]It is fun, though.
[118:22.92]We are already seeing all duplicates.
[118:25.81]Well, the thing is, if we could make the game stretch out longer, I think it would hide the duplicates.
[118:30.81]Yeah.
[118:31.57]If they were more... How many players can you have?
[118:34.03]Four or five?
[118:34.71]Four is the max.
[118:36.19]Too bad we don't have any one other friend that would play this with us right now.
[118:40.58]Too bad.
[118:41.60]Running out.
[118:42.00]Too bad.
[118:43.12]I did.
[118:43.52]Nope.
[118:52.00]Super fight.
[118:54.36]Super fight.
[118:56.24]Boy.
[119:02.97]Duplicates.
[119:07.71]I mean, all the orange ones are just really good.
[119:20.21]Oh, orange?
[119:20.95]Orange, you're glad I didn't say pineapple?
[119:22.77]Okay, I'm being a wicked bad sweat boy right now.
[119:27.99]Anybody else like a sweat boy right now?
[119:31.03]I got this new light that's fucking beaming down on me.
[119:33.57]Fat boy.
[119:34.69]It's a fat boy.
[119:38.17]Riding unicorns in heaven.
[119:46.03]attack opponent's genitals well who's gonna start as the robot with uh no genitals again to speak up as a robot I don't reproduce but I am however armed with a shrink ray and a sadness ray so I will turn you into the smallest saddest Medusa you've ever seen this is so so tiny the problem is that you're gonna have to hit me first
[120:07.64]And I'm buffering.
[120:08.48]I'm lagging all over the place.
[120:10.16]And you're gonna have a really hard time hitting me.
[120:12.19]And I think just one accidental look into my eyes, and you're turned to stone.
[120:20.01]See, that doesn't work on robots, though.
[120:21.83]That's a human condition.
[120:23.93]When the humans look into Medusa's eyes.
[120:26.00]Does Medusa turn other gods into stone?
[120:28.58]Looks like we have a racist here that doesn't think that omnics are people.
[120:33.91]Oh, pulling the... Does a submarine swim?
[120:36.26]Overwatch.
[120:36.96]Hey, guys, you know that game Overwatch?
[120:39.16]You know that Overwatch?
[120:39.94]Hey, vote for Ster.
[120:41.58]Hey, remember Overwatch?
[120:42.48]Ster plays that game.
[120:43.32]I play that game.
[120:44.70]So do we.
[120:45.66]We play that game.
[120:46.34]So you know the rules that omnics are people can... Do I think?
[120:50.64]Does a submarine swim?
[120:51.86]Are they all not people?
[120:53.12]Is it the eyes that Medusa is turning into stone or the consciousness of the being behind them?
[120:58.43]And she's turned animals and various mammalians into stone as well.
[121:03.74]You lost me.
[121:05.12]Yeah, you lost me.
[121:05.89]Go on.
[121:09.27]We're in heaven, which is a generally happy place.
[121:11.79]You think you'd be happy, but my sadness ray is gonna make you so depressed that you might just kill yourself.
[121:18.08]I don't know.
[121:18.46]I don't know.
[121:19.30]I hope that that's not the case, but you could because that sadness ray is tuned to such a degree that you can't possibly hope to overcome it emotionally.
[121:29.66]That's a good point.
[121:30.69]I'd say being in heaven is my advantage because the second they realize a robot with guns is in heaven, you're getting booted.
[121:40.77]See, in heaven, heaven likes people that reproduce, and Medusa that only attacks genitals.
[121:45.73]People, by the way.
[121:47.53]She has a history of attacking genitals.
[121:49.17]In fact, she only attacks genitals.
[121:51.09]So if you can't reproduce any humans, then you've made humans extinct.
[121:55.70]If you kill them all, you kill all their genitals.
[121:57.70]I'm lagging.
[121:58.34]I just lagged into heaven by accident.
[122:00.82]I'm there, and you're a stone.
[122:04.34]Medusa doesn't turn.
[122:06.49]And she turns humans to stone, not inanimate objects that are met with electricity and all that.
[122:11.05]We already argued this point.
[122:12.95]Doesn't matter.
[122:13.57]I'm playing a game of two racists.
[122:16.10]Robot wins.
[122:16.80]Crowd has spoken.
[122:17.78]Have fun.
[122:19.62]Medusa can do whatever she wants.
[122:20.84]Not going to do anything against a robot.
[122:23.44]Sorry.
[122:24.98]But she loves.
[122:26.48]One time winner.
[122:30.18]There's your one time.
[122:32.39]One time winner.
[122:33.71]One time.
[122:35.66]starring Etalyx alright bring it on bring it on final round me versus Etalyx oh I don't think that people are going to be able to hear Jerma's argument
[123:09.16]I think it's gonna be a pretty hard time convincing people when you have no webcam or voice.
[123:13.76]Are you serious?
[123:20.14]No, go ahead.
[123:21.57]Am I muted right now?
[123:22.85]No, I turned it back on.
[123:23.77]Alright, I went first last time, so you go first.
[123:27.67]Alright, well, I didn't expect the thing at the end there, but a super effective assassin...
[123:33.73]would have a pretty easy advantage over anything.
[123:36.40]Level one, but still a super effective assassin versus what is a moose riding a horse.
[123:43.98]How awkward, how are you gonna move around?
[123:46.06]Awkward, I mean, I've seen soul level ones beat Dark Souls, so I mean, come on.
[123:51.57]By the way, let's just be perfectly clear about something.
[123:54.89]Level one, what typically are the enemies in level one zones?
[123:58.75]Stupid fucking moose and boars and bears.
[124:02.00]You are EXP for me.
[124:04.22]Here with the moose riding a horse, first of all, think about the skill and finesse that's required for a moose to be able to tame a horse.
[124:11.44]Now that you have that fresh in your mind, consider the fact that we're floating down on a parachute.
[124:15.14]The floor is lava.
[124:16.08]What's the assassin doing?
[124:17.36]Oh, he's in the lava.
[124:18.74]That is just too bad.
[124:21.04]While the house is on fire, I'm safely, safely parachuting down.
[124:25.42]None of that's affecting me whatsoever.
[124:26.88]So your assassin skills are completely lost in the fact that you can't even reach me.
[124:31.94]What are you going to kill me with?
[124:35.42]Easy.
[124:36.90]As a level one?
[124:37.88]You have like a wooden club.
[124:39.68]That's fine.
[124:40.01]You can give him like a wood club as your level one.
[124:42.19]So, we're in a burning, this burning building, the floor is lava.
[124:45.89]I don't have to be on the floor.
[124:47.21]There's always a part in a burning building.
[124:48.97]You know, you've seen the fucking TV shows and movies when something's on fire.
[124:52.07]There's like the one spot where there's no fire and you can just stand there and like you can find out which way you need to run through the video game level.
[124:59.57]in the video game.
[125:00.51]I said movie.
[125:01.50]Ah, fuck, I'm losing them.
[125:02.60]Alright, so rewind.
[125:04.06]I got to rewind time with my rewind dagger.
[125:06.66]No, you don't have that.
[125:08.92]Shit, I don't have that.
[125:10.04]You're like a winning token.
[125:11.22]Alright, team.
[125:12.27]You're in a burning building.
[125:13.35]The floor is lava.
[125:14.49]The only thing you're super effective is at burning.
[125:17.68]Yeah, but I could, I could throw, I could, level one, my abilities, I could, like, throwing knife up there and hit the balloon and you crash down and I'll just be hiding somewhere.
[125:23.99]Level one, I kill level ones for breakfast because that's what you do.
[125:26.55]I agree that a moose riding a horse shows some talent that a level one could never possess.
[125:30.91]I'd say moose riding horses, you have to be at least level, like, 16 to get to that zone.
[125:36.68]Oh, what?
[125:38.66]Like, maybe the first zone you fight the moose, and then, like, a couple zones later, the moose on a horse.
[125:45.24]Okay.
[125:46.36]That's fine by me.
[125:48.70]We'll see what the people say.
[125:51.60]Let the people decide.
[125:53.28]Let the people decide.
[125:54.36]The moose riding a horse, both of them in a parachute, that's in tandem.
[125:57.54]Tandem parachuting right there.
[125:59.00]That was a lot closer than I thought it was going to be.
[126:00.82]I will concede the victory to you, good sir.
[126:04.50]Thank you.
[126:05.34]Listen to the man.
[126:06.98]Listen to him.
[126:07.46]Oh wait, I didn't want you to win.
[126:11.82]Shit.
[126:14.55]I guess I didn't want either of them to win.
[126:15.93]I kind of forgot that I lost already.
[126:17.37]This is all blurring together in my mind as one continuous argument.
[126:22.31]Darren?
[126:25.67]Darren?
[126:27.47]I'm ready.
[126:29.45]I'm ready.
[126:30.13]I'm ready.
[126:34.52]Oh man, I need a break.
[126:40.12]There was a lot of people that got banned for voting for Jerma, by the way.
[126:43.75]Wait, what do you mean banned?
[126:45.27]You started banning people?
[126:46.79]I wouldn't recommend voting for Jerma anymore, anyone.
[126:50.53]You're banning people for voicing their opinions?
[126:52.87]That's censorship.
[126:53.77]Don't vote for him again.
[126:57.14]That's just my opinion.
[126:59.26]Of the long-standing peace agreement that we... I thought we had.
[127:04.28]I'll be over here on fucking Tinder trying to get a date.
[127:13.97]You first, everyone's already seen my cards.
[127:17.97]What have you got against what they already know?
[127:20.69]Oh, two famous figures.
[127:25.53]Who could have expected the celebrity showdown?
[127:30.39]Before you do anything, I am already beginning to talk your pants off.
[127:34.79]You are stunned.
[127:35.61]You are immobile.
[127:36.35]I can talk the pants off anyone, and all ten of you, I don't care how many of you are, they're all listening, and that's the first attack that I've put on you.
[127:44.01]Can I just say that with ten Justin Biebers all with their pants off, what Miley Cyrus could resist?
[127:50.08]That primal urge put before her.
[127:53.98]I have you firmly in my grasp.
[127:56.07]Now is this little kid Bieber and like, or like little Miley?
[127:59.62]Cause there's, I think these are both modern.
[128:01.36]I mean, are these not, can we disagree?
[128:02.54]These are both modern.
[128:04.26]I would say modern.
[128:05.58]I'd say Jerma wants like not to have 10 naked kids.
[128:08.95]Yes.
[128:09.39]It would be ideal to have it be modern.
[128:12.87]Okay, now that ten beavers all have their pants off and are staring at Miley's powerful pubic hair, and they can only rely on heat vision to see, they're seeing a whole bunch of cotton members.
[128:25.25]But what's the hottest region of your body?
[128:28.25]It's down here.
[128:29.49]Down here in the generals where that pubic hair is coming from.
[128:31.89]So really the fact that it can move and stretch at will means you're exerting a lot of heat from down there.
[128:36.01]I'm drawn right to that area, all ten of them.
[128:39.59]You're going to mix up who is a Bieber and who is a Miley, because she can form her pubic hair to look like a donger, and they'll just think she's one of the boys.
[128:48.57]Okay, we just went off the deep end there.
[128:51.34]You sailed off.
[128:52.88]We're in a giant cave, I ought to remind you.
[128:54.82]So the fact that I can see with heat vision is a strength, because there's no light in that giant cave.
[128:59.48]There's not a source of sun or any type of flashlights, as far as I can tell.
[129:04.28]So I'm the only one that can see, and there's no hint of me.
[129:06.55]Therefore, Miley Cyrus knows to kill them all.
[129:09.39]The Justin Biebers don't know which one's a Bieber.
[129:11.37]They're gonna be fighting each other while she has the chance to snap their necks one by one.
[129:18.34]What?
[129:19.08]What, you don't agree that your Biebers are going to get lost in the giant cave?
[129:23.94]They're not because they have heat vision.
[129:25.48]They can see.
[129:26.20]But you're not allowed to use superpowers.
[129:28.06]It said you're not allowed to use superpowers.
[129:29.86]That's not a superpower.
[129:30.96]Pucking the pants off of anyone is not superpower then.
[129:34.43]That's not a good idea.
[129:36.85]You suck.
[129:37.31]I win.
[129:39.22]pubic hair stretching sounds like a superpower if heat vision is you suck I win I would agree that's too late too late if I if I lose it's just because you've been banning people for voicing Jerma's support so they think it's going to be if they vote for me too who's going to willingly vote for Justin bieber thank you nobody
[130:04.91]That's nonsense.
[130:06.63]Glad to be a part of the inflate star's ego even more stream.
[130:11.01]Fucking horse shit.
[130:12.41]That's surprising.
[130:14.05]I don't know where I got the people on my side, but maybe they just didn't want to vote Bieber.
[130:20.81]Bieber.
[130:23.41]Bieber.
[130:24.97]Good closing statement.
[130:26.45]Bieber.
[130:27.24]Oh, look who's got the crown.
[130:31.78]Oh yeah, you do.
[130:32.64]I don't know what that is.
[130:33.62]It's not a crown, it's a dunce cap.
[130:36.83]I bought so many of these fucking card packs.
[130:40.07]That's the premium DLC crown that you unlock after you buy enough of the game.
[130:45.85]Only two of these are ones that I haven't seen before.
[130:56.96]This is really the only option I have.
[131:01.62]Hopefully it works.
[131:02.80]That's the only option I had.
[131:09.25]Okay.
[131:09.87]That's perfect.
[131:16.69]Obama versus a Democrat.
[131:18.63]We don't fight each other.
[131:20.96]Oh, that's, that's, that is, that's, this is a fight.
[131:23.10]We're going to have to fight each other though when the winner is chosen by a sword fight.
[131:26.60]Well, I'm the ultimate Democrat.
[131:29.14]I'm the ultimate fucking Democrat.
[131:30.50]You're just a Democrat.
[131:31.36]I'm the ultimate Democrat.
[131:32.58]The president is the ultimate Democrat.
[131:34.79]Oh, you picked wrong, my friend.
[131:36.51]But this Democrat shoots webs out of his anus.
[131:39.71]And I would say that's something that you can't even control.
[131:43.01]So against my will, I'm just going to start spewing webs onward in an elevator.
[131:46.65]Not a lot of place for Obama to move around.
[131:48.75]It looks like your sword's a little bit stuck.
[131:51.81]Well, it doesn't really matter considering I have a suit of armor on and I can summon cats to do my bidding I could just summon a shitload of cats.
[131:58.76]You'll spray the cats.
[131:59.64]You won't even hit me.
[132:00.30]You'll miss you'll Obama Listen, listen Obama Where's the birth certificate?
[132:06.12]Where's the birth certificate?
[132:07.70]I didn't vote for any democrat and I didn't vote for you.
[132:09.74]Where's the birth certificate?
[132:11.68]He already showed his long-form certificate.
[132:13.70]Alright, it took so long.
[132:15.07]It was faked.
[132:15.83]Why would they delay it?
[132:17.77]I was born in Kenya.
[132:20.03]After I fucking kill you, I am the president.
[132:22.43]Next in line.
[132:23.24]You didn't pick and ban.
[132:25.00]You lost at the pick and ban phase.
[132:27.16]I'm the ultimate Democrat.
[132:28.56]You're a regular fucking shit bomb Democrat.
[132:31.08]And I'm wearing a suit of armor.
[132:32.72]I got cats.
[132:33.76]And Obama is obviously trained to use a sword.
[132:36.10]He's the president.
[132:36.58]He's the commander in chief.
[132:37.54]I'm not just any Democrat.
[132:39.18]I am Joe Biden.
[132:41.95]Oh, it doesn't say that on the list?
[132:43.53]No, you could be, like you said before, what'd you say about Kirk?
[132:45.79]What'd you say about Jason?
[132:46.92]You could be any Democrat.
[132:48.26]It could just be anybody.
[132:49.20]In fact, past arguments.
[132:50.14]It could be anybody.
[132:51.04]No, past arguments are very valid in this case.
[132:53.34]Okay, that's fine.
[132:53.78]Yeah, people say it.
[132:54.28]The Democrat doesn't say Joe Biden.
[132:56.54]It says Democrat.
[132:57.04]I let it stand.
[132:58.46]Obama is this.
[132:59.24]Well, if I have a gravity gun, and we've all seen the movie Gravity.
[133:07.77]My light went out.
[133:08.53]I'm sorry, my argument's gone.
[133:09.85]That was a complex time travel argument.
[133:11.85]He's gone.
[133:12.93]He's gone.
[133:14.89]There wasn't any time travel in gravity.
[133:17.11]That was a sign.
[133:17.89]I mean, there technically was, wasn't it?
[133:19.53]Because he sends gravity back in time.
[133:23.35]No, that's interstellar.
[133:28.17]Shut the fuck up.
[133:30.77]Different movie.
[133:33.02]Different movie.
[133:37.06]Alright, Alex, what was your opinion?
[133:39.90]Obama.
[133:40.76]Of course.
[133:42.14]I can't even believe I argued against Obama.
[133:43.44]I forgot to vote for it.
[133:44.78]This better be 80-20.
[133:47.44]Okay.
[133:48.42]About 80-20.
[133:50.58]Democrat versus the ultimate Democrat.
[133:53.39]Jesus Christ.
[133:55.79]Oh, my God, Obama.
[133:56.73]He did not hesitate.
[133:59.05]He just consumed his own.
[134:01.95]That was fucking crazy.
[134:03.07]God damn it, Obama.
[134:04.97]I got my crack.
[134:18.63]All these cards I'm unlocking, like, why aren't I seeing them?
[134:21.37]Why aren't they, like, actually coming up?
[134:23.06]I want a deck that doesn't suck.
[134:32.66]That I haven't seen.
[134:33.44]Ha.
[134:41.49]Ha.
[134:45.35]I cheated.
[134:46.47]Yeah, I didn't even invite you.
[134:48.15]I have to hold on.
[134:49.17]Payment for services rendered.
[134:50.39]Pleasure doing business.
[134:51.95]Hey, biz.
[134:53.23]You didn't like my... I liked it.
[134:58.07]Whoa.
[134:58.71]I liked it.
[135:01.81]Okay.
[135:03.39]We got lights.
[135:05.23]Can you guys ready up?
[135:06.31]Can you guys vote against these fucking idiots for not readying up and I have to tell them every time?
[135:10.94]Shut it.
[135:12.52]Fucking shut it, mate.
[135:23.00]To be fair, there really shouldn't even be a ready button.
[135:28.22]You should be able to start the game whenever you want.
[135:32.64]Good luck.
[135:34.28]Good luck.
[135:35.80]You're gonna need it.
[135:44.61]I'm trying to throw myself backwards.
[135:47.08]You can't beat me.
[135:48.16]You can't get to me.
[135:49.66]Okay.
[135:50.52]Biblical times.
[135:51.80]Very heavy fog.
[135:58.03]Not only am I always orgasming, but there's a force field around me.
[136:01.87]You can't touch me as long as I'm always orgasming.
[136:04.87]I'm always jamming it.
[136:07.89]What are you going to do?
[136:09.51]It's biblical times and a very heavy fog and it's just a clown jamming it in the corner with a force field.
[136:15.81]How do you
[136:16.29]and the Goblin King that can only be killed by asphyxiation.
[136:19.87]You have to strangle me, and too bad you're jerking off all the damn time, because there's no way either one of us will die.
[136:26.13]It's a draw.
[136:27.31]It's a draw.
[136:28.77]I can only die by, well, hold on just a minute there.
[136:32.50]I can just throw bears at you while you're slamming.
[136:34.68]There's a force field around you.
[136:38.30]How long do you think you can masturbate for?
[136:41.00]Did you read the card is always having an orgasm?
[136:43.76]Always?
[136:44.18]Always?
[136:46.16]Always having an orgasm isn't the same as always masturbating though.
[136:49.33]That's true.
[136:51.26]That's true.
[136:52.74]How long can you possibly do that before you get raw?
[136:57.93]But I guess this just determines, uh, you have to go on your... what you think masturbation is, your definition of masturbation.
[137:04.81]If you're sticking something up your ass, oh, that's a form of masturbation.
[137:08.04]If you fall asleep with it, well, it's in your ass.
[137:10.40]It's still in there.
[137:11.52]I would, I mean, haven't we all... How are you gonna beat me?
[137:15.52]How are you gonna beat me?
[137:16.54]I'm not, I'm arguing that it's a draw and I think I'm just gonna win by popularity.
[137:21.22]But I, I, look, bears, I can just feed the bears.
[137:23.75]Here's what's gonna happen.
[137:24.89]You're gonna be sitting there doing your thing.
[137:27.05]Jammin', slamma-jammin' away, that's fine.
[137:29.19]I'm gonna have a shitload of bears.
[137:30.47]I'll throw 50 of them.
[137:31.65]I'm gonna keep them fed.
[137:32.91]We're gonna just have like a little, we'll make a fucking zoo.
[137:35.67]You can be in the bear enclosure.
[137:37.55]At some point, you're gonna have to stop masturbating, which means the bears are gonna attack you.
[137:41.95]You're part of my zoo now.
[137:43.76]Good luck.
[137:44.42]I hope you can do what you want.
[137:45.44]Naked clowns gotta eat.
[137:46.80]Naked clowns gotta eat.
[137:47.94]Naked clowns gotta eat sometimes.
[137:50.28]And you can only kill me by choking me.
[137:51.66]Goblin King, big fat neck.
[137:52.98]Good luck getting your hands around that.
[137:54.38]If I'm always having an orgasm, I'm eating something.
[137:58.50]Holy God.
[138:01.30]You are, like, disgusting tonight.
[138:03.69]Like, you are fucking over the line tonight.
[138:06.39]You do what you have to do.
[138:07.45]You ever watch Bear Grylls?
[138:10.11]Bear Grylls never...
[138:12.90]We'll go.
[138:13.42]We'll go from there.
[138:14.40]I mean, close enough.
[138:16.34]I win Goblin King.
[138:17.82]He's got to stop sometime.
[138:19.20]He's got to stop sometime.
[138:20.46]And he's in the enclosure.
[138:21.64]He's at the zoo.
[138:22.28]The bears are going to fucking kill him.
[138:27.47]Let's see what the people say.
[138:30.53]Oh!
[138:32.55]Doesn't even have to win.
[138:34.19]Fucking popularity contest.
[138:36.99]Fucking popularity contest.
[138:38.82]Oh, it looks like the naked clown with the force field also keeps on...
[138:43.48]No, you know what just happened?
[138:44.40]This is all these people in your chat saying like, oh, yeah, dude, like, no, I can go forever.
[138:50.14]Like, I'm anybody.
[138:51.14]I can do it long.
[138:52.68]No, yeah, we all don't.
[138:54.56]The people saw that the force field not only prevents you from killing him, it keeps him alive.
[139:00.53]So he can outlast the Goblin King by never dying, by pure masturbation.
[139:05.45]But you have to masturbate to be able to keep the force field.
[139:08.79]Is your dick made out of iron?
[139:12.40]think so never said you had like a fucking wooden penis you have a regular human penis my god it would never work popularity contest not this again the fucking popularity contest that's all it is I didn't even click anything it's gonna give you random cards aren't they nice work here's the thing
[139:39.89]You've won more than once.
[139:40.75]I know that's the joke at this point.
[139:47.43]Parents are brother and sister.
[139:49.59]What does that even mean?
[139:50.47]Well, you've already got some messed up genes there, Loki, but I guess we already knew that.
[139:55.13]It's just a prank.
[139:57.95]I'm the master of pranks.
[140:00.47]It was a joke.
[140:01.71]By the way, you guys are both elderly.
[140:04.77]Yes.
[140:05.31]Fighters are elderly.
[140:06.95]You're both old.
[140:07.45]Well, you may have been the trickster at one point in your prime, Loki, but since we've gotten old, you've gotten slow.
[140:14.09]And when we've gotten slow, your mind isn't as sharp as it used to be.
[140:18.81]Now, I'm a samurai armed with a chainsaw.
[140:21.43]You might have some literal bricks when you squeeze over and dust comes out of your ass, but we have a chainsaw battle in Wonderland.
[140:32.40]So it might be pure, it might be pretty.
[140:34.60]Jazz hands.
[140:35.29]But there's gonna be red bloodstained all over Wonderland when I'm finished.
[140:39.55]I don't think you can operate that chainsaw with literal jazz hands, especially a samurai who's used to swords.
[140:44.79]I'm assuming you're coming from some feudal era and you don't even know what a chainsaw is.
[140:48.21]With your jazz hands, you're not gonna be able to do that.
[140:50.99]So you're pretty much just an old Japanese guy.
[140:55.01]Which doesn't impress me.
[140:57.33]And again, we're gonna have to say that Loki is a god.
[141:00.50]Which your argument was before.
[141:02.52]It's not just any random Loki, it's the Loki.
[141:08.20]So your argument is that my samurai is too old, but your god from the beginning of time is fine, even though we're both elderly according to the rules of the game.
[141:16.76]So I'd say that me being from a different era doesn't really matter all that much.
[141:22.26]It's just your red herring arguments throwing out here, trying to distract the people from what really matters, which is two old men fighting.
[141:28.87]One has a chainsaw and one has a bunch of bricks.
[141:31.93]One has jazz hands and one doesn't.
[141:36.04]One has mutated genes from their parents being brother and sister.
[141:41.50]Incest, Loki?
[141:42.34]I don't think so.
[141:44.79]Incest, Loki.
[141:46.35]It is a different kind of Loki.
[141:47.91]I can't support incest, Loki, or any form of incest, I guess, but... I still stand by the fact that you're just an old Japanese guy, which are usually very well-tempered, and I'm just gonna kick your ass.
[142:01.56]Loki is, in fact, doesn't matter how old Loki is.
[142:04.93]I think he is, like, thousands of years old.
[142:07.19]So he doesn't really age.
[142:08.81]Yeah.
[142:09.27]Sorry.
[142:10.29]But the rules stipulated that we're both elderly.
[142:12.89]So the rules trump the character.
[142:16.67]Even an old Loki, I think, has little.
[142:18.67]But an old Loki with messed up genes, see?
[142:21.51]That was the closest one.
[142:23.27]Close.
[142:23.89]That's close.
[142:25.17]Samurai chainsaw, though.
[142:26.23]With jazz hands.
[142:27.97]That was very close.
[142:29.01]One time winner.
[142:32.48]Congratulations on that close victory.
[142:34.70]Close victory.
[142:35.79]Thank you, chat.
[142:37.59]You're not invited to the next talk-off.
[142:43.25]I need more cards.
[142:49.33]I want to be a diddler real quick.
[142:55.54]I don't even remember how to... Oh.
[143:03.56]Yeah.
[143:05.24]Now it thinks I'm fucking funny.
[143:06.90]Now it thinks I'm like entertaining.
[143:13.27]I want it to be a card diddler.
[143:17.95]That was a close one.
[143:21.03]Something about you today just looks off.
[143:23.70]You're like bubbly.
[143:26.86]Bubbly?
[143:27.56]Yeah.
[143:28.60]What do you mean bubbly?
[143:30.80]Bubble.
[143:32.34]Bubbly?
[143:32.96]Yeah, you're just bubbly, man.
[143:35.02]Bubbly like, I'm very happy?
[143:38.61]Bubbly like, I got bubbles all over me.
[143:42.13]Yeah.
[143:43.57]Oh, no, no, no.
[143:44.61]Something does seem a little off.
[143:45.85]Would you like to know why?
[143:46.79]Why?
[143:47.77]One second.
[143:48.27]Is that a high chair in the back?
[143:49.67]Like, where's the baby?
[143:52.45]Here's why.
[143:52.87]I think that's his printer chair.
[143:56.27]Oh, yeah, because you're... Do I look normal now?
[143:58.33]Yeah, now you look normal.
[143:59.94]Now I look like I typically do, right?
[144:01.06]Can you fucking ready up?
[144:02.48]You fucking wanted me to prove why I looked, like, different.
[144:04.84]You could have done both at the same time.
[144:13.34]See?
[144:13.76]Like, this is how, like, I typically look on facecam.
[144:15.26]You got your, like, creepy shadow eyes now.
[144:17.10]I know.
[144:17.36]I'm back on, like, the eye cam.
[144:19.96]Maybe we'll need it for this fight.
[144:23.20]I've seen all of these before.
[144:31.54]I'm just going with the cards that I'm dealt, and we'll see how we win this.
[144:36.67]I gotta turn it on.
[144:38.39]People are gonna get mad.
[144:39.83]Judgmental versus... Judgmental!
[144:45.51]Entertainer, really.
[144:53.63]I'll admit it.
[144:54.53]I'll say it first.
[144:55.27]Yes, I am a meth addict.
[144:56.77]I come clean.
[144:58.23]I was nailed to a cross.
[145:01.65]But I'm in heaven.
[145:02.58]I made it to heaven anyway because I admitted those things early.
[145:06.56]Well, first of all, you're a meth addict that's nailed to a cross.
[145:11.96]In heaven.
[145:13.45]That's the funniest part, he's in heaven!
[145:15.17]Listen, he's nailed to a cross, and okay, you have a chainsaw for a hand, you're nailed to a cross, I'm an elf with a whip of fire, I just gotta whip you once, and you're just done.
[145:24.06]Why is he just saying Hodor?
[145:25.78]What is Hodor?
[145:27.05]What is that?
[145:27.73]Wow.
[145:28.29]That's so relevant.
[145:31.21]Hodor, it's so relevant.
[145:32.49]Wow, I know that word, Hodor.
[145:33.97]Hey, chat, can we get some hashtag meth in chat?
[145:36.99]Yeah, hardcore, yeah.
[145:39.18]Hold the door.
[145:40.64]Hey, hey, I have an elf.
[145:42.42]He's armed with a whip made of fire.
[145:43.92]Hodor.
[145:44.92]Because it's like a thing people said.
[145:47.76]No, there's no way you win.
[145:49.18]I mean, there's lions everywhere, but you will be eaten because you've nailed your cross blood.
[145:52.73]They can smell it.
[145:56.03]I really dug myself a hole here.
[146:04.37]I mean, it doesn't matter where we are.
[146:07.01]I- I can- the whip is long enough where I might- your argument might be, oh, well, you're not that tall, you're- It's a whip.
[146:12.70]It's a whip, it's a fucking whip.
[146:15.14]We're in heaven.
[146:16.10]Would you say that Jesus Christ, that they're used to this sort of punishment of being nailed to a cross, and they can sympathize and they can relate to my situation?
[146:23.50]That's not who you are.
[146:24.20]No, I'm not, but he sympathizes, that's why I'm in heaven.
[146:26.66]And when he sees an elf whipping me, he despises what the elf is doing to me, and he says, you know what, cast him down, that elf doesn't belong here.
[146:36.71]No!
[146:37.75]No!
[146:38.61]That was just gra- Hodor!
[146:40.40]Hodor!
[146:41.72]Hodor!
[146:43.12]Hodor!
[146:43.62]Yeah, see, that's my argument.
[146:44.96]That was an internet meme.
[146:45.98]You should've seen it.
[146:46.98]You should've seen it.
[146:48.24]Remember?
[146:48.60]Hove the door.
[146:49.06]You should've seen it.
[146:49.74]Remember that meme?
[146:50.53]Alright, Etalyx.
[146:53.69]He wins.
[146:54.83]If only I had the argument in the first, like, minute.
[146:58.00]Gotta go with meth addict here.
[147:00.20]Nailed to the cross in heaven.
[147:01.26]There is some sympathy there, I'm sure.
[147:03.38]And you're whipping him with a whip made of fire.
[147:05.84]So the fire, like, demons... You are sane spawn.
[147:07.97]They're done with you.
[147:09.01]Like, I'm getting some help from the big man.
[147:11.41]They don't like you.
[147:12.91]Come on.
[147:13.79]Hold on.
[147:14.99]Hold on.
[147:16.39]They're going to tell you to hold the horn to kick you out of heaven is what they're going to do.
[147:20.49]Hey, guys.
[147:22.56]Hold on.
[147:23.90]I win.
[147:24.95]I won.
[147:25.67]You did win.
[147:26.25]I said Hodor.
[147:27.33]Damn it.
[147:28.45]I said Hodor.
[147:29.51]I win.
[147:34.34]I would have nailed him to a cross.
[147:36.00]That would be pretty brutal.
[147:38.58]That would be brutal.
[147:39.78]There's an animation of my card being nailed to a cross.
[147:43.48]Yeah.
[147:44.47]Yeah.
[147:45.39]I'd earn some sympathy points for sure.
[147:53.05]Uh-oh, I'm going against the master.
[147:58.44]The master does not have any good cards.
[148:04.29]He's a word whacker too.
[148:11.53]Okay.
[148:11.87]We're gonna go with this.
[148:14.15]Widowmaker.
[148:15.19]Why do I always get this one card?
[148:18.17]Oh, Widowmaker.
[148:19.07]I collect twice.
[148:20.35]I'm an otaku.
[148:21.65]Vote for him.
[148:22.83]He's got Widowmaker.
[148:28.17]I'm okay with this.
[148:31.11]Super fight.
[148:33.18]Well, first of all, I want to be very clear.
[148:35.10]I have a whole battleship full of people.
[148:37.44]Master ship, which means I can feed them all very well.
[148:39.94]They're all going to be very healthy and very well fed.
[148:42.22]So this is your cat with a puppy musket.
[148:45.86]What can you fucking do?
[148:46.72]You've got a bunch of well-fed people of warriors on a battleship, and I run a giant pitch.
[148:52.44]You may have a battleship, but you're just a cook.
[148:54.43]You're just in the kitchen all day.
[148:56.83]You don't really know how to combat anything.
[149:00.11]But catch here, what counters a battleship?
[149:02.71]Well, submarine, I would suspect.
[149:04.85]So since all the cats with the puppy muskets can breathe underwater, then you can't really do anything to us while we're underneath your ship.
[149:11.28]I've helped Jerma before, so I'm going to help you now.
[149:13.52]What good is your battleship if you're in a factory, for one, and it's a lightning storm?
[149:17.98]I don't think you want to be sailing.
[149:20.58]It's true.
[149:20.94]Fine.
[149:21.66]Fine.
[149:21.92]We are in a jar of acid factory.
[149:23.64]Go ahead.
[149:23.94]A jar of acid factory.
[149:25.30]A lightning storm boat wouldn't work.
[149:27.22]The crew all perish.
[149:28.46]The giant pigeon's getting struck first.
[149:30.04]I still ride a giant pigeon.
[149:31.72]Alright, but what are cats known for?
[149:34.00]They're known for knocking things off of shelves, off of tables.
[149:37.49]There's a lot of jars of acid in this factory that I think this cat would be really adept at knocking off onto your pigeon's head and your head.
[149:47.01]Covered in acid.
[149:47.75]What are you going to do?
[149:48.45]You ever been to New York City?
[149:49.93]You think these fucking pigeons don't think they can take a little acid?
[149:53.42]These pigeons, pigeons in New York eat like cigarette butts for food.
[149:56.92]But the higher you fly, the more likely you are struck by lightning.
[149:59.84]Isn't that right?
[150:00.54]But I don't need to fly.
[150:01.34]I can just walk around.
[150:02.02]Pigeons don't even fly.
[150:02.80]They walk around.
[150:03.60]They like fucking do this and they walk around and they eat trash and cigarette butts.
[150:07.16]A little acid's not going to hurt a giant pigeon, especially when the master chef can take those cigarette butts and potentially make a very delicious souffle.
[150:15.01]which would be used to create a much stronger pigeon.
[150:19.33]You're MasterChef.
[150:20.05]You want to cook.
[150:21.09]I'm shooting puppies at you.
[150:22.11]Are you going to cut those puppies up into tiny little pieces?
[150:24.00]Are you going to cook a cat?
[150:25.16]I don't think so.
[150:26.16]A MasterChef always has supplies.
[150:27.94]You're going to want to pet those puppies.
[150:30.52]And when you're petting them and you're loving them, I'm going to be pouring acid on your head.
[150:34.12]I'm hungry now.
[150:35.22]I want the chef to make me dinner.
[150:36.72]I voted for the chef.
[150:38.17]I'm, like, hungry, too.
[150:40.11]I'm thinking about eating cats and cigarette butts.
[150:41.97]I'm just so hungry.
[150:43.17]I'm thinking about eating cigarette butts.
[150:44.42]It just made me so hungry.
[150:47.60]Alright, let's see.
[150:48.80]Star?
[150:50.74]What?
[150:51.46]What do you think?
[150:52.40]I said chef.
[150:53.52]I'm hungry.
[150:57.78]We've all been hungry before.
[151:00.52]Lots of people get hungry.
[151:03.28]Wow, that was even closer.
[151:06.92]That's the closest.
[151:08.06]That was really close.
[151:09.00]That was really close.
[151:11.80]I can see that I didn't expect to have that many points.
[151:14.92]I didn't think it was going to be that close.
[151:19.06]How many more are we doing?
[151:22.54]Thanks for playing, guys.
[151:23.36]I don't know.
[151:25.06]How many do you want to do?
[151:26.12]You actually won by 22 votes.
[151:29.92]Wow, holy shit.
[151:30.66]22 votes.
[151:31.06]That's fucking crazy.
[151:32.70]I don't know how many of you guys want to keep it going.
[151:36.59]What do you want to do?
[151:38.55]Did you want to play those other games?
[151:41.61]Well, you made me really hungry.
[151:42.61]Let's play one or two more of this, and this whole eating cigarettes just made me hungry.
[151:48.93]It actually did.
[151:49.59]I'm going to make some chicken burritos.
[151:53.14]It's going to be amazing.
[151:54.31]Where's, where's, where's... Chicken.
[151:57.15]Chicken burritos.
[151:57.73]Chicken burritos.
[151:58.61]Where's Otto?
[151:59.25]Where's Otto?
[152:06.82]That's so lame.
[152:08.04]These are all lame.
[152:09.86]Yeah.
[152:10.74]Mine's pop culture reference.
[152:11.98]Hey guys, you like that one character?
[152:13.40]You remember that character's name?
[152:20.43]He went on a three-week video game bender that cost him his health, job, and wife.
[152:26.80]Oh, no.
[152:28.06]I think I won already.
[152:29.54]Do you know who Finn is?
[152:31.64]Finn the adventurer who beats up skeletons all the time.
[152:34.98]Not only do I have a bow, I'm probably not going to use my bow against skeletons, but I can pull any weapon out of my anus.
[152:41.25]Any old Finn could pull out a bazooka out of his anus.
[152:44.41]I'm still pulling a weapon out of my anus.
[152:49.79]You got me this time.
[152:51.18]You're a skeleton wearing a skeleton.
[152:53.46]You're a fraud.
[152:54.32]Can I name Finn?
[152:55.94]You might have got me this time with what you think was these wor- you're some kind of wordsmith with saying, oh, this character Finn, he's got an anus, he can shoot cancer.
[153:03.02]Let me tell you something.
[153:05.16]Exoskeleton on top of a skeleton.
[153:07.94]That's a double skeleton.
[153:10.01]That is twice the amount of armor.
[153:12.05]And I'm riding a centaur.
[153:13.01]It might be depressed, but it's still a centaur.
[153:15.39]Are you telling me that you're an exoskeleton bug millennium boy?
[153:18.17]We're talking about exoskeleton bug millennium boy here.
[153:21.02]And that is somebody that... Cancer tipped arrows, be careful!
[153:26.93]Be careful with those.
[153:28.15]That's a long-term kill.
[153:30.53]That's going to take years, potentially.
[153:32.37]That's going to take a long time, and you might even get yourself in some trouble there, too.
[153:36.22]And pulling weapons out of your ass sounds very painful.
[153:38.08]Are you going to give the skeleton bone cancer?
[153:40.38]Yeah.
[153:40.64]What kind of cancer can you give a skeleton?
[153:42.76]I'm not.
[153:43.18]I said I wasn't going to use the bone.
[153:44.34]I was just going to pull a bazooka out of my ass.
[153:46.52]And this fin, it could be any fin, and there's a lot of fins in this world who are used to taking huge things up the ass, and I just happen to be one of them.
[153:53.70]I can take it out real easily, slide it right out.
[153:57.98]If I've had this power for my whole life, I'd have to have lube ready.
[154:01.20]It would cause damage.
[154:02.23]You would cause damage.
[154:03.15]You would cause massive damage to your intestinal tract.
[154:05.95]Skeletons doesn't have fucking goo and all kinds of fucking poo and blood and shit.
[154:10.63]If we're going on the reality of the situation, skeletons don't even have like tendons or muscles for you to even move.
[154:15.88]You're going to rely on this depressed centaur who's going to forfeit.
[154:18.40]Sure.
[154:19.64]He's not going to forfeit.
[154:20.96]Depressed doesn't mean that you're going to give up.
[154:23.64]He's depressed.
[154:24.30]Yes, it does mean you're going to give up.
[154:25.60]It means you need to take some... He's sad about something.
[154:27.56]He'll be alright.
[154:30.88]And he's got an exoskeleton.
[154:32.84]Yeah, you do whatever you want.
[154:33.96]You're gonna rip your ass by pulling a weapon out.
[154:35.82]It's gonna be bad.
[154:36.60]And you're gonna try to take like 10, 20, 30 years to kill me with a cancer arrow.
[154:42.58]Skeletons from horror movies, they're scary.
[154:44.24]They're fucking ghouls and shit.
[154:45.70]I'm done talking.
[154:46.44]I win.
[154:47.70]We all know us.
[154:49.48]I don't think so.
[154:51.16]I think you are overestimating your victory.
[154:54.51]You have nothing here.
[154:57.18]Robotic exoskeleton can resist a good number of weapons.
[155:00.68]Very true.
[155:03.22]I'm happy.
[155:04.28]I think it actually could have been in your favor.
[155:06.36]I don't think you argued the exoskeleton enough.
[155:09.08]Yes, I did.
[155:09.80]I said he had an exoskeleton.
[155:12.33]I think you had to focus on that.
[155:14.27]I do like Adventure Time.
[155:21.32]When is Finn and Marceline gonna date?
[155:24.28]Hey, when's Finn gonna be in Smash Brothers?
[155:27.84]Why did I get all of these again?
[155:29.42]Did I turn everything off?
[155:30.66]Yeah, why did I get all of these again?
[155:32.28]Invent your time.
[155:48.59]I saw that show once.
[155:50.75]I saw that show.
[155:51.57]I like it.
[155:52.39]Oh, it was the Finn that killed all those people.
[155:54.47]Never mind.
[155:54.93]I should argue that.
[155:56.07]Word whacker?
[155:56.85]72 virgins with enormous exposed breasts.
[156:09.97]I want to make sure I get this right.
[156:11.21]I don't want to look like a fool.
[156:13.13]72 versions.
[156:14.25]How many shots is magic missiles times three?
[156:16.93]There's 216 missiles coming at your dragon.
[156:20.13]What are the odds that even a few of those missiles hit your dragon?
[156:23.42]Okay, the odds are pretty good.
[156:24.78]What you haven't considered is that when I see all those missiles coming at me simultaneously, I just hold my breath, and I create a force field while holding my breath and deflect all of those magic missiles that strike me.
[156:34.69]And guess what a dragon does when they're done holding their breath?
[156:37.53]They spew fire over the entirety of that cave, which is a very confined and closed area.
[156:43.59]Let's do a little bit more magic.
[156:44.68]It's getting a little toasty in there.
[156:47.22]All those 72 virgins are burning up with their fake imps.
[156:50.62]Let's do a little bit more math.
[156:52.20]We have 72 virgins shooting 216 magic missiles per shot, because each magic missile is three missiles.
[156:58.94]That's one for each breast, so we're gonna multiply that by two.
[157:02.44]432 magic missiles.
[157:04.55]That's a long duration of magic missiles.
[157:06.49]You're gonna have to hold your breath for a very long time.
[157:08.43]And I don't know about you, but that dragon's lungs are gonna be burning up with fire the longer he holds his breath.
[157:13.89]Everyone knows that a dragon is not the type of enemy you could expect to find in the early stages of any game, whereas Magic Missile is one of the moves that you do, in fact, begin a game with, which makes it one of the bottom tier.
[157:26.94]Sure, you could level it up over time if you want, but what are the odds these 72 virgins have done so?
[157:32.84]Pretty slim, I'd say.
[157:33.82]That's a good point.
[157:34.86]Could everyone tell me how many minutes into the game?
[157:39.11]How many minutes into the game do you kill a dragon in Skyrim?
[157:42.47]It's like the first ever, like, here's one.
[157:44.71]Oh, that's not true at all.
[157:46.19]The dragon kills everyone at the beginning of Skyrim, actually.
[157:48.81]But the first dragon you actually get to fight.
[157:50.29]Just because you're a dragon doesn't mean you're a good dragon.
[157:52.37]Remember again, Daenerys Targaryen.
[157:54.95]Dragons are in Skyrim.
[157:56.37]Remember that chat when you're voting.
[157:58.56]Skyrim's a great game, and there's a lot of dragons in Skyrim.
[158:00.92]I want you to remember that.
[158:02.90]I'm torn here.
[158:07.80]It could be a baby dragon.
[158:10.18]It doesn't specify the age of the dragon.
[158:12.44]That's what's good.
[158:13.22]How old the virgins are?
[158:14.38]They could all be babies.
[158:15.36]There's not a good argument at all.
[158:16.52]They're still shooting magic missiles from their enormous exposed breasts.
[158:19.67]Do you think babies have enormous breasts?
[158:20.55]I vote for the dragon.
[158:22.38]Dragon's a dragon.
[158:23.50]Let's just not forget that the dragon is wearing cement shoes, which is very resistant to these magic missiles as well.
[158:29.45]And when I come down and smush them underfoot, they're just going to be little spouts of guts.
[158:35.75]All I'm saying is 432 missiles.
[158:39.15]Oh, that shouldn't have been that close.
[158:40.98]No.
[158:41.90]I mean, that shouldn't have been that far away.
[158:43.58]It should have been closer.
[158:46.53]Everyone just saw the word virgins.
[158:49.03]They thought of themselves.
[158:50.39]I relate to that.
[158:51.76]I know I'm virgins.
[158:53.72]What?
[158:55.64]You're very insulting.
[158:56.96]What?
[159:02.92]My chat is still saying 72 of me would beat the dragon.
[159:09.74]Alright, I want to eat some food.
[159:11.76]I keep thinking about eating cigarettes.
[159:15.34]I don't want the basic.
[159:16.26]I guess I do.
[159:18.28]So, last one?
[159:19.80]Yeah.
[159:20.58]Well, unless... Yeah, I guess.
[159:22.43]I don't even know what my food options are.
[159:26.39]Thankfully, I have stuff in my freezer, so I'm just going to cook something.
[159:29.05]I just want to say, I'm the only one here that's level 10, so I must have won more, and you all suck.
[159:36.07]It doesn't bother me.
[159:37.19]I'm having a grand old time.
[159:38.56]Etalyx, if you gained experience for readying up,
[159:43.60]It's the only power I can exert over you.
[159:46.49]Oh, that's actually pretty funny.
[159:56.31]I think I read the same thing.
[159:57.62]It only took 40 virgins to kill Onyxia every week.
[160:00.92]That's true.
[160:02.76]That's a funny comedy bit right there.
[160:04.36]That guy's got some good comedy sense.
[160:06.04]Alright.
[160:13.44]Okay, this one's just dumb.
[160:16.82]Like, it doesn't matter.
[160:17.72]I'm ready.
[160:23.56]I'm ready for you, Star.
[160:24.74]That's the only one I could come up with an argument for.
[160:30.11]Like this.
[160:31.27]Hi, hi, you heard of this character before?
[160:33.23]I bet you never heard of a Kweepus.
[160:44.25]He put a strap on, okay.
[160:47.45]Well, I will argue this one only point.
[160:50.26]I'm a pet rum of rock.
[160:51.88]I'm a rock.
[160:52.46]I drank five energy drinks.
[160:53.54]Doesn't matter.
[160:54.02]I'm just a rock.
[160:55.26]How do you beat a rock?
[160:56.54]How do you kill a rock?
[160:57.74]You can't.
[160:58.68]Even if you break him up into sediment, it's still there.
[161:01.57]Even if you grind him down to dust, he's still there.
[161:04.93]He doesn't have any life.
[161:06.45]He doesn't have any death.
[161:07.99]It's a fucking rock.
[161:10.41]Well, if you'd notice the scenario at the bottom, we were both shot out of huge cannons at each other from one mile away.
[161:16.57]So I'd imagine a creeper and a rock colliding in the air.
[161:19.65]I would blow you up.
[161:20.95]And as we all know, in Minecraft, creepers can blow up rocks.
[161:24.77]They can blow up anything.
[161:25.43]And they turn into dirt and sediment.
[161:29.12]They turn into winters.
[161:31.38]When a creeper blows up, what happens to that creeper?
[161:35.26]Tell me.
[161:36.24]What happens to the creeper when it blows up?
[161:40.88]Go ahead, say it.
[161:42.56]What happens to the Creeper when the Creeper explodes in Minecraft?
[161:45.86]He becomes a winner!
[161:47.14]He is gone!
[161:47.70]Defeated!
[161:48.08]Destroyed!
[161:49.15]Out of this world!
[161:50.15]But would you not say that destroying your enemies at no matter what cost is a victory?
[161:55.69]You aren't destroying me.
[161:56.67]A rock can't be fucking destroyed.
[161:58.35]You can only turn into smaller rocks.
[162:00.83]You'll explode me into smaller rocks, which makes me even stronger.
[162:03.91]In Minecraft, the rocks get vaporized.
[162:05.71]It's a square, and then you blow up on the rocks, and it's gone.
[162:09.14]No, no, you can pick it up.
[162:11.18]The character can pick up the stone and go smelt it and shit.
[162:14.14]Well, so what?
[162:14.48]You can pick up my strap-on.
[162:15.82]That doesn't mean that I haven't, like, defeated you.
[162:19.59]It doesn't matter what you say, it's a rock.
[162:21.57]Even if you blow up a rock, it just becomes smaller rocks.
[162:23.99]Grind those rocks down, even the smaller ones, into dust.
[162:26.41]There's still dust, they're still there.
[162:27.71]A creeper explodes and is gone, doesn't exist.
[162:30.56]Rock, one.
[162:32.20]Creeper, zero.
[162:32.94]Therefore, Jermall, 19 star, four.
[162:39.22]But it's a creeper.
[162:41.50]Oh, sorry!
[162:42.08]I played Minecraft!
[162:42.86]I love Minecraft!
[162:43.88]I love Minecraft!
[162:44.74]My favorite game of Minecraft!
[162:46.07]My favorite game of Minecraft!
[162:47.65]It's a creeper!
[162:48.31]It's a Twitch emote!
[162:49.77]I'm gonna be honest, I don't know who to vote for because both of you seem to ignore the other two cards that you were dealt, so... I don't know.
[162:58.40]I don't think the stop breathing will help me.
[163:01.22]I took an arrow to the knee.
[163:02.16]You don't have a knee and you can't drink.
[163:05.74]Yeah, so I'm just a rock and you can't win.
[163:08.22]You can't beat a rock.
[163:09.36]They can't lose and they can't win.
[163:11.04]But you will explode eventually because you're going to get too close and you're going to do the sea thing.
[163:14.28]Yeah.
[163:16.84]Wow.
[163:17.26]I am actually really happy that you won.
[163:20.30]I would have hated to have won just off the fact that my things were Minecraft.
[163:25.45]I have Minecraft character in mind.
[163:27.50]So like the 23% of people that voted for me are like the brainless shitheads.
[163:31.74]So I'm glad that my chat is made up of at least 70 senseless people.
[163:35.74]I have senseless people.
[163:36.46]You guys are such a dick.
[163:39.82]70?
[163:39.88]That's pretty good odds for a chat.
[163:41.94]And some of you guys are just wrong.
[163:47.77]Alright.
[163:49.71]Oh boy, this is perfect.
[163:53.89]I'm just going to break your neck.
[163:56.27]I've got a six foot neck.
[163:58.85]I'm going to grab you by your head and like turn your office.
[164:05.21]It's over.
[164:09.26]Put the argument aside for one second.
[164:10.96]And can I just say the other card I was about to pick was giraffe.
[164:16.58]I was just close picking giraffe.
[164:18.20]Alright.
[164:18.46]Anyway, I'm the mother of dragons.
[164:21.79]and I turn anything, weapons, to feathers, I have a gravity gun, it's a feather, whatever.
[164:25.97]Have you ever seen a giraffe fighting with its neck, though?
[164:28.67]That's not a powerful neck.
[164:30.17]That's not a giraffe.
[164:31.54]That's a child beauty pageant.
[164:33.84]Okay, like, have any of you ever seen the beauty pageant reality TV shows?
[164:38.72]Have you seen the temper tantrums that these small children can throw?
[164:42.26]Yeah, you'll accidentally break your own neck.
[164:44.48]No, I'm in a berserker rage.
[164:46.63]swinging my fucking head around.
[164:48.71]Alright, but I've made it through this many years of my life with a six foot neck.
[164:52.71]I'm trying, I know how to use it enough that when we're, while we are handcuffed together.
[164:56.88]It's been like three years.
[165:00.40]How many years?
[165:01.22]You've been cuddled for three years for your deformity.
[165:04.98]In my three, like in my two years.
[165:08.24]Make a wish foundation.
[165:09.94]You can snap my neck, but we're still handcuffed together and you don't have the key.

[165:47.24]Feathers.
[165:47.78]This is gonna eliminate your own weapon against you.
[165:51.12]And you know, that's fine, because you have a long- Dude, there's a Khaleesi.

[166:15.51]All I'm saying is 432 magic missiles.
[166:20.13]That's a lot of magic missiles.
[166:22.21]This is going to be like 99 to 1.
