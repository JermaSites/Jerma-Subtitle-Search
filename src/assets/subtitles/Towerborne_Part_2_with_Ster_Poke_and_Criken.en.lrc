[00:50.77]Well, I just turned this frame on.
[00:52.21]Let me wait.
[00:59.40]I can't wait for you to peak the horror.
[01:02.98]That is a fake fan.
[01:05.61]It is peep.
[01:07.07]P-E-P.
[01:10.77]Come on.
[01:14.97]They get banned?
[01:16.62]No, you don't get banned.
[01:18.14]And by the way, you're a real fan.
[01:20.08]Don't worry.
[01:21.20]I'm just kidding with you.
[01:22.16]I'm just messing around.
[01:25.14]Uh, what is the TSB?
[01:27.89]The TSB boys.
[01:30.15]I mean, I think it's gonna stick.
[01:32.73]I think it's gonna stick.
[01:38.44]That's the sponsor boys.
[01:41.14]The TSB boys.
[01:43.63]the the sponsor boys boys yeah I think I think it's gonna stick uh yeah we're gonna be playing tower born for uh sponsored this is the last sponsor stream of tower born
[02:09.77]Playing it for a couple of hours.
[02:12.31]I am here alone right now.
[02:14.47]Because, let me tell you.
[02:16.80]I'm just going to move over to the game.
[02:17.88]Because why not?
[02:19.86]I played the game off stream a little.
[02:22.04]I wanted to get one of the other characters leveled up.
[02:27.21]Because I kind of like one of the other classes.
[02:31.25]I'm cheating.
[02:33.42]Well, Criken had a character that was like level 20.
[02:38.46]Hold on.
[02:38.92]I'll show you.
[02:42.15]Let me pump the audio to you.
[02:45.63]There we go.
[02:48.72]I'm not level 0.
[02:51.50]I made one of these.
[02:55.52]Oh no, sorry.
[02:58.73]Shadow Striker.
[02:59.61]Got to level 10.
[03:02.09]I kind of, I don't know, I feel like I want to play the other, but I didn't want to start at 1 with everybody else.
[03:08.48]I like Sentinel, but I think Shadow Striker is a lot of fun too.
[03:10.52]I'll show you.
[03:17.94]How do you find a way to play the Dex build in every single game?
[03:21.97]I kind of like Dex.
[03:22.83]Dex is fun.
[03:24.71]Why don't you like Dex?
[03:31.82]What level are you gonna unlock eyebrows?
[03:37.56]I'll get them later.
[03:43.61]Do you like incense or scented candles?
[03:46.77]Um...
[03:49.33]That's a good question.
[03:51.45]I don't know.
[03:52.25]Scented candles can kind of give you a headache, but incense, they can kind of leave that burn smell.
[04:00.11]I'm going to say incense.
[04:02.88]I was going to say incense.
[04:04.00]Yeah, thanks to Stoic for sponsoring this stream.
[04:06.46]We're going to be playing for a couple hours.
[04:07.69]The TSB is going to show up in probably like 10 to 15 minutes.
[04:12.57]I just want to do a couple solo things because I want to prepare.
[04:15.34]Is the game still in the free-to-play mode?
[04:19.62]I know it was until today.
[04:23.69]Can somebody confirm with me?
[04:24.65]Is the game still free to play as of right now?
[04:29.22]I knew it was happening until today.
[04:30.20]For nine more hours.
[04:31.02]Okay.
[04:32.09]So the game is in its free-to-play period.
[04:35.47]It'll come out of that in nine hours.
[04:38.36]So if you actually want to check it out, you know, it's there.
[04:44.10]For nine more hours.
[04:44.90]Alright, I want to get this chest.
[04:47.75]What about White Knuckle?
[04:48.43]Yeah, I'm going to play White Knuckle later.
[04:50.77]Probably get a Ster coaching session.
[04:52.75]Sounds like a good time.
[04:53.59]Oh, I didn't even give the plan.
[04:54.65]What am I doing?
[04:59.16]I'll just do a random one here.
[05:03.29]That would be like little 15.
[05:06.30]Yeah, we're gonna play white knuckle.
[05:08.74]And then I'm probably gonna play a mystery game.
[05:12.95]We're gonna get a mystery game.
[05:18.58]I got some.
[05:18.96]I did get that mouse off the screen.
[05:25.31]I like the combos on this character.
[05:28.29]Ster said this yesterday, but the juggling is actually pretty fun.
[05:34.76]And I did want to show what it looks like alone because with four people on the screen, it is really fun.
[05:39.51]But I want you to see what I'm doing.
[05:41.81]I want to prove that I can fucking do stuff.
[05:43.31]You know what I mean?
[05:46.70]I was top of the meter every time we played.
[05:53.27]And no one's going to guess the mystery game.
[05:54.87]It's not possible.
[05:59.97]Good luck trying to guess the mystery game.
[06:05.14]Hey, is the mystery game Walk Away, A Tale of a Dog and His Journey for PS2?
[06:11.38]That's how you can tell that somebody is in pre-stream chat.
[06:13.83]That's how you know.
[06:22.57]No, I'm not going to... No, stop guessing the mystery game.
[06:25.40]You're not going to get it.
[06:30.50]Alright, I did have a new move that I unlocked.
[06:32.04]Let me check it out.
[06:39.99]My gear score is already so much better than these losers.
[06:53.42]It is LOL.
[06:54.77]I'm so glad I got an LOL.
[06:59.87]Yeah, I want to get to level 14 or 15 before the boys show up.
[07:06.82]Oh, I want to check it out.
[07:07.74]Hold on.
[07:08.00]It's this.
[07:09.84]Why did I not combo?
[07:10.54]Alright, that does a lot of damage.
[07:15.93]It's good.
[07:21.37]I wonder where you get one of these.
[07:22.53]I want to get another one of these little guys.
[07:29.44]The boys are here now?
[07:31.50]I got to get one or two missions in before...
[07:38.29]What about Walk Away, A Tale of a Cat and Her Journey?
[07:46.92]Well, that's the sequel.
[07:47.86]That's Walk Away 2.
[08:00.43]Break it.
[08:02.75]Come on, I gotta level up.
[08:03.73]I gotta be the best person on the team.
[08:12.44]Oh, shit.
[08:17.25]Can you guys change your name to the sponsor of bimbos?
[08:22.05]I don't know.
[08:23.44]I'll consult.
[08:26.30]I'll consult.
[08:38.95]You got a fragile ego?
[08:41.81]No, I don't.
[08:43.05]I think I like that name.
[08:48.10]They weren't asking.
[08:49.02]They were saying that.
[08:50.48]Well, whatever.
[08:50.94]I also want to open up... I have a couple of these curio things.
[09:04.08]I want to see what they do.
[09:12.70]Don't read the mean chats.
[09:15.01]I don't think being called a bimbo is a mean chatter.
[09:19.35]That person's just stating a little opinion, sorry.
[09:32.45]There it is.
[09:32.87]It's just an opinion.
[09:39.31]I mean, it's fine, it's alright.
[09:45.90]Alright, I'm level 10.
[09:46.62]I'll probably get to level 11 or 12.
[09:48.24]Maybe I can get one more in before everyone's here.
[10:01.64]What drops?
[10:02.76]If you have Twitch drops enabled and you watch this stream for long enough, you will get access to in-game opportunities.
[10:17.07]Which are... Hold on.
[10:22.35]I think it's items.
[10:23.14]I think it's some cosmetics.
[10:29.95]Hey, what's TSB?
[10:30.97]I wasn't here.
[10:31.63]Well, you're going to have to catch up.
[10:36.36]You don't walk into a movie, a sequel to a movie, and say, hey, what happened to the last movie to the person sitting next to you in the movie theater?
[10:51.52]Yeah, you do.
[10:52.85]Who does that?
[11:04.23]Oh, actually kind of getting hairy.
[11:14.02]I forgot you can teleport with this guy.
[11:33.32]Yeah, I like the parry guy.
[11:35.05]Not being able to block does kind of suck a little bit, but... I just like doing the damage.
[11:41.16]I just want to do more damage.
[11:42.08]Alright, what level am I going to be?
[11:43.47]Give me blue.
[11:57.81]Hey, did you hate Dracula 3?
[11:59.39]Can you be honest?
[12:01.43]Yeah, kind of.
[12:02.07]That game was not good.
[12:03.86]But it's alright because this weekend we're going to go through it.
[12:06.52]We're going to go through it.
[12:07.24]It's going to be fine.
[12:10.48]Can I get one more input?
[12:11.26]It looks like we've been waiting for one or two more people.
[12:16.73]You were so hopeful?
[12:19.43]I mean, the whole second half of that game might be way better.
[12:22.13]We'll find out.
[12:29.01]I think that whole game was worth doing for three hours yesterday just to get the blood test part like somebody said.
[12:35.42]Alright, let me do this.
[12:36.98]Because I unlocked this and I have some of these.
[12:41.28]There we go.
[12:42.87]Alright, I have four of these.
[12:48.13]I gotta get a good look.
[12:51.53]Do I want this one?
[12:55.12]That's kind of cool.
[12:59.91]So this is the Curios.
[13:04.78]Because you can do this.
[13:07.28]There's this one.
[13:09.30]Which is, I believe, yeah, it uses the Ritz.
[13:12.31]Pop left, that like white looking currency.
[13:16.63]This, I guess you can unlock.
[13:17.85]Okay, so you gotta click.
[13:19.39]Kind of like the version of a Battle Pass.
[13:23.18]In a way, right?
[13:25.66]I'll give you the emote.
[13:26.58]Might as well.
[13:32.43]And I think this is all cosmetic.
[13:33.99]I don't think it does anything for you in game besides you make you look cool.
[13:39.21]I'm fairly certain about that too.
[13:41.94]Uh, let me see something.
[13:42.60]Let me see this one.
[13:43.44]This one is two to unlock it.
[13:48.06]I don't play it with the... Rockbreaker.
[13:53.79]I like this.
[13:56.27]Your character looks weird, dude.
[13:58.23]I just made a weird character.
[13:59.71]It's alright.
[14:03.33]I mean, it's going to be this one, right?
[14:09.27]I got to show up looking super snazzy for the boys.
[14:14.86]I think I want this one.
[14:15.52]Let me look one more.
[14:18.96]Okay, that one looks cool.
[14:20.54]This is birds of a feather.
[14:21.58]I like this one.
[14:31.21]I like this one better than this one.
[14:34.51]I am a blue and yellow Andy, though.
[14:36.59]I think that's a great combination.
[14:38.03]I love blue, teal, pink, orange.
[14:43.72]Red.
[14:45.48]That is named every color.
[14:46.54]What the fuck am I talking about?
[14:48.75]What am I talking about?
[14:52.65]That is named every color.
[14:54.13]Did I name every color?
[14:56.83]Dude, your channel is green.
[14:58.82]Well, it depends where you are.
[15:00.88]My channel is sometimes blue and sometimes green.
[15:05.48]I have two different sort of branding color schemes.
[15:09.46]Yeah, there's teal.
[15:11.34]There's more of a green.
[15:13.13]Look at the second channel.
[15:13.85]The second channel is mostly green.
[15:15.09]It's green and pink.
[15:15.95]Green and red.
[15:18.65]The main channel is a lot of blue.
[15:20.00]It's a lot of blue, a lot of teal, a lot of pink.
[15:25.04]I'm going with this one.
[15:27.57]Hold on.
[15:29.33]There's a lot of these.
[15:33.11]Oh, that's an emote.
[15:38.21]Oh man, I could probably make such a funny joke with that with the boys.
[15:47.43]There's actually a shitload of these.
[15:50.78]I like that.
[15:54.32]You haven't used the main channel in 10 years.
[15:56.07]The main channel is an archive.
[15:58.69]The main channel is not to be used for anything pretty much ever again.
[16:05.62]In fact, I might even go log into it and just call it like the Jerma985 Museum.
[16:12.57]It's definitely this one, right?
[16:15.86]How do I get to that one?
[16:18.14]Alright, I'm going to unlock this one.
[16:20.62]Alright, I'm claiming this one.
[16:21.59]Hopefully I'm going to claim it.
[16:27.16]I got it.
[16:31.32]Okay.
[16:31.44]Okay.
[16:37.21]Here it is.
[16:40.35]Okay.
[16:40.97]Oh, I need more of that currency.
[16:44.26]Oh, shit.
[16:44.56]I gotta... I gotta... Okay.
[16:47.34]I need... We gotta play.
[16:50.49]Alright, we gotta get the boys in here.
[16:51.85]I need money.
[17:00.13]Well, I need in-game money.
[17:01.57]I need in-game currency.
[17:03.23]I need the writs.
[17:08.73]Alright, what level am I now?
[17:11.94]Level 12.
[17:12.50]Okay.
[17:12.88]I have some new skills.
[17:15.64]I think if I get one more, I should be good.
[17:18.89]I definitely want.
[17:28.26]I don't really care about the healing.
[17:29.80]At least as of yet.
[17:31.26]I'm going to do one more alone.
[17:32.25]Because I want to get to level 13, 14.
[17:34.05]And then I'll be ready to play.
[17:37.10]One more, one more, one more, one more, one more.
[17:40.52]I'll do it quick.
[17:41.36]Is everybody around?
[17:42.66]Oh, they're calling.
[17:43.49]Shit.
[17:46.77]Okay.
[17:46.91]I gotta be ready.
[17:48.41]Oh, I'm so nervous to talk to them.
[17:53.38]Hey, what's up?
[17:56.82]Hey, what is up?

[18:35.60]No, no, not on this character.
[18:37.18]This is my gamer character.
[18:38.42]I'm ready.
[18:44.81]Good evening.
[18:45.43]I mean, morning.
[18:47.43]How's it going?

[18:50.22]I'm feeling a little bit better today.
[18:51.10]Oh, you're feeling good, good, good.
[18:53.40]What was that?
[18:59.14]No neck pinch.
[19:01.77]I love when that happens, by the way.
[19:03.15]When somebody asks a question, it's like, oh, who's going to talk now?
[19:06.31]And it's silence for three to five straight seconds.
[19:09.28]And then everyone is like, okay, I guess it's me.
[19:12.66]Yeah.
[19:13.90]I think you guys are on the same wavelength to like a scary degree.
[19:17.66]Ready, White?
[19:18.30]You're both going to say the same thing in three, two, one.
[19:21.05]Cows and chickens.
[19:22.79]Cow and chicken.
[19:24.01]Alright, Sterl, let's try it.
[19:24.77]Ready?
[19:25.93]We're going to do animals.

[21:12.66]Oh, by the way, it still is free to play as of right now.
[21:15.30]I think there's about eight hours left to go on it.
[21:16.88]So it is still currently free to play.
[21:20.36]Yep.
[21:21.62]That's factual.
[21:22.14]I just checked eight hours.
[21:24.45]The group...
[21:25.96]I can kind of join.
[21:28.78]It says, group leader has changed.
[21:33.64]I'm different.
[21:34.33]I used to be different, man.
[21:36.61]Alright.

[21:42.61]Let me, let me.
[21:43.73]Oh, we're still in the same group.
[21:45.70]When I launched the game, you're in my group.
[21:47.16]Really?
[21:47.82]Wait, what?
[21:48.12]That's pretty cool.
[21:48.70]Can you invite me then?
[21:49.34]Yeah.
[21:50.18]Wait, I'm not.
[21:50.58]Are you on the, are you in the game?

[21:53.00]Of course I am.
[21:53.92]I'm not in the group.
[21:54.47]Okay, let me.
[21:57.95]Oh, I'm making it public so you could just join.
[21:59.91]Don't do that.
[22:01.62]That doesn't say I'm in a group.
[22:03.48]Anyone try playing this on the Steam Deck?
[22:05.50]This would be great on the Steam Deck.
[22:06.74]Wait, no, I clicked make leader Poke.
[22:09.26]Oh, goodness.
[22:09.88]Here we go.
[22:10.83]Oh, no, it was me and Poke were in the same group still.
[22:13.63]But yeah, I just made him leader.
[22:15.45]He accepted or probably didn't have to.
[22:18.89]Did I do something?
[22:21.36]I made you group leader.
[22:22.54]It should be fine.
[22:23.12]I invited everybody else.
[22:24.78]Oh, you actually invited me?
[22:26.16]Unless you wanted to, if you press...
[22:29.22]What is it?
[22:30.10]How did I get there?
[22:31.90]You press select?
[22:34.79]Uh, I do not have an invite from you.
[22:38.05]Uh, yeah, press select and make Glorpet the leader poke.
[22:43.12]Wait, who was, wait, did I make, wait, wait, wait.
[22:45.62]I could have got one in.
[22:46.56]I could have got one in.
[22:48.05]You're not Worryford.
[22:49.23]I'm Worryford.
[22:51.37]Okay.
[22:51.71]You already forgot my name.
[22:52.69]I'm Chris.
[22:55.01]Prince Chris.
[22:55.72]Grif.
[22:58.55]Thank you.
[22:59.03]Are we changing our classes?
[23:00.77]Am I staying fire guy?
[23:02.12]Because I kind of like him.
[23:03.30]You would lose your levels if you switched, so... I'm staying punch man.
[23:08.76]I like punch man.
[23:10.23]I changed to shadow striker.
[23:15.65]Shadow striker is fun because you can double jump.
[23:18.06]I like the bombs.
[23:19.74]The, like, dagger bombs.
[23:21.10]You throw them down.
[23:21.82]They blow up.
[23:22.28]They launch people up.
[23:23.23]It's fun.
[23:25.77]Why am I level zero?
[23:27.11]Guys, I should be way higher than you by now.
[23:30.92]Sorry, Prince Chris.
[23:33.16]He's so entitled as Prince Chris.
[23:36.93]Are we ready to hop into a match or do people want to do things in town?
[23:39.70]I think we're ready to hop into a match.
[23:41.52]I'm ready.
[23:41.98]I want to level up.
[23:43.14]I want gear and I want levels and I'm not going to spend 10 minutes in town anymore.
[23:47.67]Okay.
[23:49.06]Thanks, Stoic, for sponsoring.
[23:50.62]We're looking forward to playing this with you guys again.
[23:53.24]I am.
[23:54.67]Thanks for putting us all together and letting us game out.
[24:00.96]Were we on the next boss?
[24:03.34]I can't remember if we did it or not.
[24:05.70]We have to complete something.
[24:07.75]And that something is... Let me see.
[24:13.17]Friendship.
[24:14.91]Complete the rockin' tog adventure.
[24:17.90]Which I think that might be... That may just be in the other direction to the east.
[24:23.16]Is it over there, maybe?
[24:24.28]Yeah, it could be somewhere.
[24:25.08]Oh, there it is, yep.
[24:25.77]So we have to reverse this way.
[24:28.19]I actually didn't really... I guess I didn't really understand this until late yesterday, but... I thought... Because if you go to one of these, you can just open the chest.
[24:37.12]I kind of just... Yeah.
[24:38.50]So if you... You don't have to necessarily clear it.
[24:40.94]It's just kind of there.
[24:42.25]I see.
[24:42.59]I think we gotta go this way.
[24:43.93]Sir, do you see this?
[24:44.65]Courage loot rush?
[24:47.07]Uh, yeah.
[24:48.20]Well, I did on the main menu.
[24:49.70]Are you ready?
[24:51.96]Yeah, overworld is pretty cool.
[24:53.48]I like this system.
[24:57.09]It's fun that you can see everyone.
[24:57.93]Player canceled.
[24:59.15]Hmm.
[24:59.85]Not me.
[25:00.61]Ooh.
[25:01.58]Awkward.
[25:05.80]Does it just say player?
[25:07.16]We don't know who did it.
[25:08.23]We don't know who did it.
[25:09.01]It could be anybody.
[25:09.73]Kinda sus.
[25:12.45]alright I'm looking for I'm looking for dust oh this guy's a pro now telling you I was I was playing off stream
[25:36.23]Yeah, so this I think does, it is like good on Steam Deck too, because imagine like it's a very controller friendly game.
[25:42.42]I think it looked good on a small screen.
[25:44.10]Someone was asking that earlier.
[25:45.40]Are you guys playing keyboard and mouse?
[25:46.52]What are you guys playing?
[25:47.28]I'm playing controller.
[25:49.16]Controller.
[25:50.27]Yeah, to me this is a controller game.
[25:52.83]I don't think you plug in a mouse at all.
[25:58.15]I got to remember the combos.
[26:00.42]I'm ready to blast.
[26:04.90]Are we still shutting out bosses or have we moved on to another bit?
[26:08.85]Boss.
[26:10.53]Let's see how that goes.
[26:12.95]Hut.
[26:14.05]Hut.
[26:14.61]Hut.
[26:15.45]Hut.
[26:19.12]The huts actually are really important to get rid of because they just keep spawning them.
[26:23.20]Very true, Prince Chris.
[26:24.48]Thank you.
[26:26.81]You can see he's done his research.
[26:28.43]Oh, wrong button.
[26:36.42]Forgot my keybinds.
[26:38.65]I like just fighting the enemies in like nowhere while you guys are doing the main thing.
[26:44.32]We're splitting up good.
[26:47.40]You know, I think we're a lot more in sync today than we were yesterday.
[26:50.24]I think for sure.
[26:50.99]Do this.
[26:52.95]Also, do we have to do the trials to get the gear score up higher to make it harder?
[26:57.52]Yeah, that's how you do the trial.
[27:00.15]Yeah, I think we have to do the trial to beat the boss solo, and that gives you the next tier of difficulty in the world map.
[27:09.42]It was just really hard to do when we had no gear.
[27:11.50]We could probably do it now, but I think we all got to do it separate.
[27:16.71]Somebody's asking, Criken, how's your neck?
[27:18.41]He said early on that it was doing better.
[27:22.14]It's true.
[27:22.42]He did say that.
[27:24.74]We'll find out.
[27:25.90]Well, I prayed for you a lot last night, so.
[27:28.27]Oh, that's probably what did it.
[27:29.09]Thanks.
[27:30.29]Everybody pray for Criken right now.
[27:32.09]I want to hear it.
[27:33.21]Everybody in the chats, please.
[27:35.84]Do I also have to?
[27:37.46]Everyone tweet it.
[27:41.40]Pray for Criken?
[27:42.60]No, that's not a good thing.
[27:45.67]My mom is going to see that trending and she's going to freak out.
[27:59.40]How about give Criken your energy?
[28:04.70]That's a lot of energy.
[28:05.90]I mean, I'm still on steroids.
[28:07.18]I don't think I need more energy.
[28:08.65]Did I ever tell you guys the stream that I wanted to do?
[28:10.65]The positive energy stream?
[28:14.47]I don't think so.
[28:16.19]This is a stream where I was going to say every single person on Monday at 3 p.m.
[28:21.48]had to give all their positive thoughts to me on stream.
[28:26.38]I remember this, but I remember it being curses.
[28:29.55]No, no, that's what started this.
[28:31.72]I said, no, we're going to have a positive energy stream.
[28:33.44]And I was going to try to rig up a device in my office.
[28:38.56]Like, you know, like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
[28:42.61]I was going to rig up a thing where it just floated me and shit around the room as people were sitting there and having positive thoughts for me.
[28:50.32]I was going to try to start glowing.
[28:51.20]Like a suspension thing?
[28:52.24]Yeah.
[28:52.72]Oh, my God.
[28:57.36]You think this is going to be reality someday or is it?
[29:00.17]I don't think so.
[29:01.05]I think you've spoiled it.
[29:04.26]And I wanted to bring other streamers into it too.
[29:07.13]So have other people start to do negative energy.
[29:09.68]For instance, like Ster or crack and a poke.
[29:11.38]You guys be like, no, no, no.
[29:12.30]Oh, I see you, Jerma.
[29:15.45]No, no, no, no.
[29:16.45]No, negative.
[29:17.84]No, be, like, negative about it.
[29:19.32]Like, oh, no.
[29:20.40]Guys, he's doing the positive thing.
[29:22.08]I only think negative thoughts about him right now.
[29:25.09]And it was going to start affecting my stream, and it was going to piss me off.
[29:28.37]Oh.
[29:28.45]Like, I was going to start hovering.
[29:29.39]While you're floating around the room.
[29:30.45]I was going to hover back down and, like, start turning green and be mad at my community for not, like, praying hard enough.
[29:39.97]That's next level.
[29:42.27]Dude, this is a lot of enemies in the barn.
[29:45.49]do they live in here yeah I think we just invaded their home to be honest I'm just killing that guy that guy had like seven seconds of air time he's alive he lived to tell bam your fireballs
[30:15.97]Wait, mine?
[30:19.59]Blue!
[30:21.80]I got a blue!
[30:24.84]Nice job.
[30:28.36]I got like 20 blueberries in the fridge.
[30:32.87]Oh, by the way, you guys should have access now to the Curios tab.
[30:39.48]Wait, how you guys all 17?
[30:40.80]You guys grinded off stream?
[30:43.10]No, I think it's because you switched.
[30:45.24]Yeah, you switched classes, so you got to catch up.
[30:49.39]You're getting there, though.
[30:50.27]You're at 11 already.
[30:52.25]Oh, I just... Prince Chris looks like a background Attack on Titans character.
[31:04.02]No, he doesn't.
[31:04.80]He didn't fully render it.
[31:06.76]He looks like a noble from a distant land who just showed up at the tower.
[31:18.62]I think I'm working with right now.
[31:22.83]I finished two dailies.
[31:25.01]Nice.
[31:30.25]We can just continue or we're getting a lot of like skill points and stuff.
[31:33.42]I think you can put in skill points like real quick here while we're still yeah, yeah, it's actually I didn't even if you Scroll down, there's way more stuff to put points into.
[31:43.73]Yeah, there's a ton.
[31:45.89]oh this was a big one for me I was the there's a lot of cool stuff in the trailer of like showing some of the abilities I get I guess you can look at them all in here yeah there's uh oh yeah did you see that one move the the rogue has like the shadow striker throws like a dagger and then launches it back up in the air like the crazy juggle thing
[32:05.55]Let me see.
[32:07.54]Oh, okay.
[32:08.00]It was so cool.
[32:09.64]I was just watching Rock Puncher clap everybody.
[32:12.27]I missed it.
[32:14.11]Yeah, I want that thing.
[32:14.95]It was too locked in.
[32:19.68]We get poison moves, Jerma.
[32:21.16]We can do a combo and inflict poison on the enemy.
[32:25.84]Yeah, that's coming up here.
[32:27.60]Are you 20?
[32:30.24]I'm 17.
[32:31.46]What if we all go into town and we do the tier 3?
[32:35.51]Or I have to do the tier 3?
[32:37.25]Yeah, let's make it harder.
[32:39.48]Let's make it a challenge.
[32:41.34]I think it's because I'm the group leader and I haven't done it.
[32:44.34]Or I could just pass it to Criken if you already have it done.
[32:48.39]I have it done, but you should do it too.
[32:50.55]Might as well.
[32:50.97]188.
[32:51.31]Okay, yeah, let's just do it.
[32:53.61]Do what?
[32:54.51]I'm going to try the tier 4.
[32:56.36]The tier 3 challenge dungeon?
[32:59.24]Yeah, the right side of town.
[33:01.86]Yeah, there's like a door with a little dueling thing on it.
[33:04.55]You just go in there.
[33:05.63]Did you see that one thing in front of it though?
[33:08.21]The money rush thing?
[33:10.40]I think we can all do it.
[33:11.78]It's like an event.
[33:13.10]This is cool though.
[33:13.64]So theoretically, could you just not do this and have the game not be like crazy hard?
[33:19.51]I mean, I guess we just wouldn't get like late game gear.
[33:23.77]Cool that you can kind of adjust it however you want, though.
[33:36.06]Oh!
[33:36.70]I can't fail the challenge dungeon.
[33:38.61]Everyone will make fun of me!
[33:40.93]Yeah, this is where your skills have to stand on your own.
[33:45.52]How am I?
[33:45.96]I'm good.
[33:46.20]I'm in a stoic mood.
[33:47.64]Thank you, stoic...
[33:51.61]in like a stoic mood oh my god they hurt yeah they still hurt I don't know if I upgraded my gear oh oh actually I'm not doing well I wasn't anticipating the uh the double there yeah I'm kind of getting mauled
[34:24.10]Oh, that was my opportunity.
[34:27.92]I'm trying to tier four and it's very hard.
[34:36.49]I'm going to make it, guys.
[34:49.82]I don't know if I have the DPS, guys.
[34:54.83]Watch that hail.
[34:59.49]I gotta be better at doing that.
[35:00.95]Maybe I didn't spec into it.
[35:02.70]You can pop up.
[35:06.90]He keeps dodging it.
[35:20.64]I don't think I'm on time.
[35:21.24]I don't think I'm on time.
[35:24.22]You have a minute 40, he's half.
[35:27.05]Oh wait, there's a time limit too, you're right.
[35:30.91]Release a DPS check.
[35:39.30]Come on, come on, come on, come on, do it!
[35:40.82]Oh no!
[35:42.04]Oh, he did like a triple combo in the air and I died.
[35:45.13]Aww.
[35:55.54]I don't think I'm strong enough.
[35:57.36]Yeah, I think I needed to do some upgrades that I've been skipping.
[36:00.71]If you guys aren't strong enough, I'm not, so.
[36:02.41]I got him to half HP in a minute.
[36:05.83]We can pass the Criken.
[36:07.58]Because you have it, I think.
[36:09.10]Shit.
[36:09.62]No, no, no, no, please.
[36:12.20]He's so close.
[36:14.06]What, Jerma Game Master level 40 isn't beating it?
[36:17.95]Where are you?
[36:18.81]I'm lower than both of you.
[36:20.63]I'm lower than everybody.
[36:23.03]I'm still fighting him, but I think it's doomed on just on DPS.
[36:28.96]I could have done it if I gamed up a little harder.
[36:32.66]He's going to be like one hit.
[36:33.76]Yeah, I could have done it.
[36:37.27]Shit, I timed out.
[36:38.85]I could have done it.
[36:39.49]I had him at like a fifth on the level four guy.
[36:46.37]I realize your magic breaks him, his guard immediately.
[36:50.28]Yeah, I think that's what it's for.
[36:52.99]If you pass me lead, I can queue us up for the higher tier stuff.
[36:55.95]I think if I did it again, I'd beat it.
[36:57.39]But yeah, I'm just going to pass it to you.
[37:00.26]That was pretty close.
[37:04.02]They're coming out.
[37:05.71]I'm confident that I can handle it.
[37:08.57]Come, come, come.
[37:11.59]Can I upgrade something?
[37:18.95]What is this quest for Bumble?
[37:22.36]bell tolling do anything he says okay that guy gets it uh you have to pass the lead I think I should be able to queue this up one second I'm in loading sorry a little bit of a load moment okay uh we're referred
[37:53.45]So, um... You're the leader.
[37:55.75]I consulted with the chat a little bit, and I know how... Where... I know where... You know, I'm okay with, you know, TSB.
[38:03.44]I think that we're cool with that, the TSB boys.
[38:06.23]I don't... I don't know what that means.
[38:10.07]I was told that we should be changing our name to, instead of this... What?
[38:18.92]What's going on?
[38:19.46]Are you okay?
[38:21.06]Tablespoon?
[38:23.55]Is there someone in the room with you?
[38:28.02]That's way better, Poke.
[38:30.26]No, I'm reading chat.
[38:31.08]They're feeding me lines like a fucking improv show.
[38:40.56]I'm not saying it, guys.
[38:43.10]I'm not saying it.
[38:43.70]You're not going to get me to say it?
[38:45.25]Sorry.
[38:49.21]I'm ready.
[38:50.19]The sponsor Boys Boys?
[38:51.33]Is that what he's saying?
[38:52.22]TSB Boys?
[38:55.94]That's what's in my title.
[38:57.28]I don't know what's in your guys' title.
[38:59.74]Oh.
[39:02.30]I said Towerborn Gang, but that doesn't really mean much.
[39:06.73]I could change it.
[39:07.61]TSP Boys, if you'd like.
[39:10.01]Oh, sorry.
[39:10.39]I forgot to mutt.
[39:12.15]Forgot to mutt?
[39:14.24]Wait, where did everyone else go?
[39:15.94]Why is it just me?
[39:17.52]What's going on?
[39:19.70]Mine says connecting.
[39:21.96]Oh, are they joining later?
[39:23.44]No, that can't be right.
[39:25.11]Yeah, we're your tag team.
[39:27.14]You have to tag us in over the rope.
[39:28.98]Oh, man.
[39:30.70]Man, this was so much better when I was the party leader.
[39:34.17]Maybe you should have beaten the boss then.
[39:36.73]I'm going to restart my game.
[39:39.07]Let me reset.
[39:42.68]Just in case.
[39:45.42]It says left the group at the bottom.
[39:47.06]Yeah, I think we have a little bit.
[39:49.13]Oh, hold on.
[39:51.76]Are you guys in a loading screen or what's the... I'm at a connecting screen.
[39:55.90]Do you guys ever think you're the other person?
[39:59.27]Like you're looking at your character and it's like, oh wait, that's not me.
[40:02.31]Yeah, like I hear these thoughts in my head and I'm always like, maybe the other one's me.
[40:06.04]You're so literal.
[40:07.84]Like you're at a party and you're talking to someone and you swap ego with them for like a brief second and you are them talking to yourself.
[40:17.87]The other me is literal.
[40:19.55]Yeah.
[40:21.46]You're too literal.
[40:30.21]See what I mean?
[40:30.61]Poke, poke.
[40:31.05]You get it.
[40:32.41]I get it.
[40:33.56]Wait, you guys been talking about me?
[40:35.44]A little.
[40:38.68]Sometimes.
[40:41.29]Okay.
[40:45.62]Mostly good, though.
[40:46.81]Okay, I'm back.
[40:47.33]I need an invite.
[40:48.67]I also need an invite.
[40:49.65]Should we leave this?
[40:50.57]I kind of aim in my life to mostly good, so it's alright.
[40:54.64]I don't know if there's a way to leave the mission.
[40:57.73]I'll just die.
[40:58.09]I think we just die.
[40:59.25]I die.
[41:02.65]Yeah.
[41:04.66]Oh, no.
[41:05.00]When you die, you take a potion.

[41:09.58]Thanks.
[41:10.70]Speaking of that, I gotta get some... It looks like Luigi or something.
[41:17.21]I think when you were on the main screen, I tried to start a new game.
[41:20.64]Here, retreat.
[41:24.66]I don't know.
[41:24.96]I think there's somewhere you can change how you look.
[41:27.97]I don't know where.
[41:29.99]In the belfry, there's a little icon with a face on it.
[41:33.88]Wait, really?
[41:35.08]Yeah.
[41:37.72]Oh dude, hold on.
[41:40.80]So now I'm in a I'm only in a party with Jerry kill so and he's the leader now.
[41:48.45]OK, I'm gonna.
[41:48.91]I'm gonna drop this party and then if you want to invite me.
[41:55.99]What the whole point was that needs to be someone who has.
[41:57.95]Right, I'm I'm not the leader anymore.
[42:02.58]I'll give you groups.
[42:04.72]I gotta figure out which one of these I... Upgrade and beat this guy.

[42:45.67]Look at this.
[42:46.13]Look at this.
[42:46.53]I think this could help us a lot right now.
[42:49.32]Look at this guy right here.
[42:50.30]This is a new thing from yesterday.
[42:52.62]Courage Loot Rush.
[42:54.16]You can collect as many coins as you can while dodging tricky obstacles.
[42:57.31]Let's do a loot rush.
[43:00.33]We can do it as a group.
[43:01.55]Let's do it.
[43:03.44]I need a Ster.
[43:06.38]Prince, we're missing Prince.
[43:07.26]Wait, does that come over there?
[43:08.22]No, we're good.
[43:10.08]Okay, I'm just... There you go.
[43:12.13]Does that work?
[43:12.85]Dude, loot rush.
[43:15.09]Loot rush.
[43:15.59]One sec, one sec, one sec, one sec, one sec, one sec, one sec, one sec, one sec, one sec, one sec.
[43:18.82]I don't think you gotta kill anything here.
[43:20.42]I think we just get free money and then we can do upgrades.
[43:22.34]Dude, mad loot.
[43:23.29]Let's go.
[43:24.67]Yeah.
[43:25.41]Loot rush.
[43:27.35]It says novice.
[43:28.66]Can we up that?
[43:29.86]Or do we have to start as novice?
[43:31.50]We gotta start level 1.
[43:34.15]Wait, did Glorpet not ready up?
[43:35.10]Guy thinks he's a master already.
[43:36.40]No, I didn't.
[43:37.38]Oh, alright.
[43:41.11]Music is kind of picking up.
[43:45.69]Alright, loot.
[43:47.04]Bring the build to start.
[43:47.88]Collect coins.
[43:50.46]Spread out.
[43:51.10]Okay, I'll get the top right area.
[43:52.24]I'll get this area.
[43:52.90]I'll get the middle.
[43:53.33]I'll get the middle.
[43:54.81]I'll get top middle.
[43:55.67]How do you get it?
[43:57.77]Run into it, bro.
[43:58.63]Wait, what?
[44:01.63]I was running weird.
[44:04.15]I don't even need to be here.
[44:07.79]Get those coins.
[44:08.64]Collect them for me.
[44:10.54]Yes, fill my father's coffers.
[44:14.94]Fill my father's coffers?
[44:15.90]Jerry!
[44:17.31]They're dropping.
[44:17.95]Immense dropping.
[44:20.81]That's such a tough day.
[44:22.65]Bombs!
[44:27.04]I tried to get them.
[44:29.36]What?
[44:33.22]Blue.
[44:33.96]Interact.
[44:34.94]Haste.
[44:37.96]Someone cast a spell.
[44:40.53]I just did.
[44:40.85]Can I go first person?
[44:44.03]Is this VR?
[44:46.80]Blue.
[44:48.10]I think we beat it.
[44:53.33]What?
[44:53.83]Can you die in this mode?
[44:56.07]I don't think there's beating it.
[44:56.95]I think we're here to get coins, man.
[44:59.26]Blue.
[45:01.06]Blue.
[45:01.54]Haste.
[45:04.76]They're coming.
[45:07.14]Oh, no.
[45:08.80]Oh, no.
[45:13.15]Oh, gosh.
[45:18.29]At the end, it's going to say who.
[45:19.39]Well, I guess me and Jerma stood in the middle for a while.
[45:21.82]We're not going to have max coins.
[45:23.26]I think I've collected three the whole entire time.
[45:27.32]Then I hope it shows us.
[45:30.85]I want evidence of your negligence.
[45:36.70]I think we've gotten every single coin.
[45:41.16]Does this add to our bank account?
[45:43.45]If we weren't the friend group.
[45:46.07]This would be hard to grab them all on your own.
[45:47.79]This would be very hard alone.
[45:49.91]Oh, goodness.
[45:52.03]I think I gotta change my name.
[45:54.64]Oh, shit.
[45:55.20]That's like a blue.
[46:01.50]After every mission, you say, I got a blue.
[46:04.05]Yeah, it's like... Every time.
[46:06.84]Is that rare?
[46:09.30]No, I got a blue.
[46:12.35]Oh, good.
[46:12.71]It didn't tell anyone how much we got of anything.
[46:16.46]Oh, yes, it did.
[46:17.66]Damage dealt?
[46:19.72]I'm blue.
[46:21.33]I did the most damage.
[46:23.03]Nice.
[46:24.57]I'm like Charlie Brown.
[46:25.59]I got a rock.
[46:29.60]Shit, that's a blue.
[46:34.33]I don't know.
[46:35.33]I love loot.
[46:36.17]Loot is like my favorite thing in every game.
[46:38.64]It's favorite color too, so I get it.
[46:44.42]Should we do a harder level or the normal game?
[46:47.39]Except coin cascade to unlock the courage loot expert.
[46:50.60]We need to be on the map going northwest, northeast, towards Rakentaug.
[46:57.13]Yeah, there's a huge... There was a huge... Somebody left.
[47:04.50]I'm... I think Pokémon was the leader.
[47:07.36]And then my game got put into loading.
[47:12.15]I was stuck in the loading.
[47:13.31]Oh, I just got the quest to do the novice one.
[47:16.90]Wait, what?
[47:19.20]Shit.
[47:21.31]We can go fight stuff instead, you know?
[47:23.57]Yeah, let's go fight stuff.

[48:58.37]There was a giant blue dragon.
[49:00.45]Oh, the world map?
[49:01.31]Yeah, the world map.
[49:03.35]Up in the top right, there was a huge blue dragon over here.
[49:06.92]I'm talking about as big as the whole screen.
[49:09.02]It's not there anymore.
[49:09.70]Maybe it's like an event or something?
[49:11.69]Oh, yeah.
[49:12.25]Like a raid boss.
[49:14.47]It was huge.
[49:14.95]It was massive.
[49:15.89]It was the biggest thing I've ever seen in the game.
[49:18.33]In my life.
[49:22.20]Alright, we gotta go.
[49:25.59]I don't know.
[49:25.93]I'm telling you, the thing was gigantic.
[49:32.00]Okay, I'm queuing us.
[49:33.90]I'm getting the mission.

[49:46.94]Okay.
[49:50.08]I did get items, but I'm not going to announce that I got them.
[49:51.78]Hold on, don't do it.
[49:52.28]Yep.
[49:52.44]I'm not doing nothing.
[49:54.77]I think if you're in that main map.
[49:55.81]Oh, it's because you guys were in loading screen.
[49:57.17]That's why.
[49:57.61]Yeah.
[49:58.45]Okay.
[49:58.57]So once everyone's loaded in, give me a thumbs up, but verbally.
[50:02.72]I'm here.
[50:03.78]Thumbs up.
[50:06.22]There was a big blue monster the size of my screen.
[50:07.88]I told you.
[50:08.52]I told you.
[50:09.04]You guys thought I was lying.
[50:10.13]The giant blue monster as big as your whole screen.
[50:13.11]I'm so sorry for doubting.
[50:14.97]That guy?
[50:15.31]You're right.
[50:15.77]Yeah.
[50:16.40]How did we fight that?
[50:16.98]How did we fight that?
[50:18.33]I think we got to clear the tiles on the way to him.
[50:21.21]Yeah, we're ready.
[50:22.79]Is everyone here?
[50:23.41]Okay.
[50:23.87]Yeah.

[50:31.02]Alright.
[50:31.70]Then everyone readies up.
[50:33.74]Nice.
[50:34.58]It's not a dragon.
[50:35.71]I got to save for like 10 seconds.
[50:37.41]I don't know.
[50:37.75]It was a big scary thing.
[50:38.89]Whatever it was.
[50:45.07]Yeah.
[50:46.52]Did the music do that for you too?
[50:53.06]Oh, it's a big one.

[52:43.62]Two on the right.
[52:44.67]Misunderstood the objective.
[52:56.38]I wish I knew how to shoot my gun.
[52:58.18]It just, it just randomly happens.
[53:01.00]Oh, um, it's a, it's a combo.
[53:03.15]Yeah.

[53:18.74]I just was messing around with him.
[53:20.03]Yeah.
[53:20.15]Just in the training room.
[53:21.23]Do you want him?
[53:21.93]And I took him from him.
[53:23.21]No, no.
[53:23.79]I wanted to play this one.
[53:25.43]Alright, cool.
[53:29.35]You can also play the same one.
[53:30.83]It's legal.
[53:33.20]Not with me.
[53:34.18]I don't do that.
[53:38.37]I like both of them.
[53:39.49]I might play the other one too.
[53:41.47]I am dead over here.
[53:42.67]And why are we not doing the two and two strategy?
[53:47.70]We had a two and two strategy and the formation was broken completely.
[53:51.75]I'm sorry.

[54:13.64]Purple.
[54:13.92]Is it blue or purple?
[54:14.56]I'm not sure.
[54:15.20]I just got two commons.
[54:16.54]You guys are getting... I'm colorblind, by the way.
[54:17.98]That's why I'm getting so excited.
[54:22.21]I don't know if I said it today, but I'm colorblind.
[54:24.21]All these tier three gear.
[54:26.37]tier three okay now yeah now we're strong enough to go beat the tier three yeah with the tier three gear alright I just got excited why is Criken always double damage this guy he has the strats I think I just have a higher gear score because I've been upgrading just say you're better than me I'm not going to say that poke I'm not going to I'm not going to put that gauntlet down
[54:57.64]That's not me.
[54:58.98]Because he doesn't have to.
[55:01.19]I'm not going to say anything.
[55:02.07]I'm just going to act stoic about this.
[55:04.01]Yeah.
[55:04.25]Shouts out.
[55:04.71]Thank you, stoic.
[55:06.04]Thank you, stoic.
[55:09.28]We just go next one?
[55:10.34]Dude, this thing's level... I need to get to level 17.
[55:14.27]Equip the threes.
[55:16.73]Yeah, I'm going to equip the threes real quick and then... I'm kind of screwed.
[55:23.36]I need EXP.
[55:24.09]Man, I'm still wearing tier one helmets just because it looks cooler.
[55:29.03]I'm a vibe gearer.
[55:31.92]Are we doing the challenge or are we just going to stay queued with somebody that already is like you, Criken?
[55:38.61]Yeah, I'm done.
[55:39.37]Just keep going.
[55:40.41]Yeah, let's keep it rolling.
[55:42.64]Okay.
[55:48.64]After this next one, if I hit 17, I do want a quick town break to be able to upgrade and dismantle.
[55:57.05]IP stuff.
[56:02.17]Cool.
[56:02.29]Do I have the one that initiates it?
[56:03.93]Yes.
[56:04.80]Okay.
[56:06.06]Sorry.
[56:06.58]Oh, it's called the... This is just over there, but there's something glowing down here too.
[56:17.03]I'll get that later.
[56:21.28]So where are we moving to?
[56:22.22]We're heading towards Rack and Tag, right?
[56:24.91]Rack and Tag, yeah.
[56:28.07]So I think there's a quest for us to beat that.
[56:29.60]Does everyone have that too?
[56:30.28]Securing the Belfry?
[56:31.54]Yep.
[56:32.35]I think we just have to keep kind of moving around.
[56:47.28]Your character's name should be Prince Piss.
[56:50.66]I don't think so.
[56:52.93]I'm a prince from a... Whoa.
[56:55.73]Boss.
[56:56.81]Boss.
[56:58.73]Boss.
[57:00.21]Or Hut.
[57:01.47]Huts first for sure.
[57:02.88]Good call out, Poe.
[57:04.08]Good.
[57:04.48]That's why you're here, man.
[57:08.34]Yes.
[57:11.44]That's why we always go on adventures with you.
[57:15.60]I didn't hear anybody else call that out.
[57:18.48]That's true.
[57:19.36]I was too focused on the boss.
[57:20.80]I wasn't sure who was the boss.
[57:22.34]Oh, he's big.
[57:22.96]Never mind.
[57:23.39]Now I'm sure.
[57:25.91]I didn't see him.
[57:32.10]Yeah, I screwed everything up.
[57:33.22]I'm down.
[57:33.80]Guys, I'm so sorry.
[57:35.02]I'm down.
[57:36.22]Frick.
[57:36.78]Oh, come on.
[57:41.50]Ooh, okay, that hurt.
[57:45.18]Ow.
[57:45.85]I'm not sorry, but I'm also down.
[57:49.47]That sucked.
[57:49.73]That was literally one tick.
[57:51.37]Let me put this into tier three, guys.
[57:52.54]Shape up.
[57:58.40]I'm getting hit by every shot.
[58:08.52]He's broken.
[58:10.00]That was our chance.
[58:11.08]Let's give it all we got.
[58:12.90]I'm doing mega damage right now.
[58:14.75]I applied stacks of poison.
[58:20.09]Take care of the adds.
[58:21.29]He killed me.
[58:26.02]Oof.
[58:30.10]I'll get you poked in just a second.
[58:35.31]Okay, I saw Jerry kill, and I was like, wow, it actually said that you're killed, but that's a weird way to say it.
[58:40.51]Jerry's Hill.
[58:41.89]I'm gonna change my name.
[58:42.77]I'm gonna change my name.
[58:44.14]I think it's Jerma every time I read it.
[58:47.14]That's why I don't know who I am.
[58:51.11]Is it me or am I the other guy?
[58:54.59]I need to be poke all caps.
[59:02.59]Oh, he's done.
[59:07.60]There's a chance.
[59:08.08]Let's let him have it.
[59:08.96]Oh.
[59:09.86]He's back.
[59:14.73]That arrow move he does just kills you.
[59:28.89]Get a stun break here.
[59:37.60]Oh.
[59:43.62]They call me Rock Breaker, not like Lion Breaker.
[59:46.67]I can't do that.
[59:47.31]Oh, come on, man.
[59:48.61]You move out of the way.
[59:49.51]I got so many charges for that.
[59:53.46]You did it.
[59:55.20]Oh, I got a random.
[59:56.28]Victory.
[59:57.24]Guys, we're going to get hella loot.
[60:06.47]We're rich.
[60:08.76]Guys, I am out of heals.
[60:14.58]Well, that's okay.
[60:16.35]We're grouping them.
[60:18.35]We're doing fine.
[60:27.50]You know, thank God this game doesn't have a stamina system.
[60:31.07]Yeah, that would definitely change up the vibe.
[60:33.74]I feel like there's too many enemies to have that.
[60:36.43]I'm glad it's not here.
[60:49.48]Divide and conquer.
[60:53.16]That was like a two trillion hit combo, by the way.
[60:58.27]Everyone is saying this.
[60:59.43]Eight seconds.
[61:01.33]Eight?
[61:02.99]oh my god wait wait we do come on no bonus failed devs if you're watching can you put like a huge combo thing on screen thank you don't do that x3 x4 yeah no blue yep is devin in chat
[61:29.29]I'll tell you, whenever a game has, like, the amount of enemies you just killed in a row, I feel like it's really awesome.
[61:35.74]For the first, like, three times you see it.
[61:39.11]And then when you get to, like, 400 combo on the screen, it's like, alright, I get it.
[61:45.46]Plus, it also makes it a way so people can't know how bad you are at a game, so don't add that.
[61:50.47]They would know that Criken gapped us by 10,000 DPS again.
[61:54.15]I wasn't going to say anything.
[61:59.10]Do you want to go one more or do you want to go back to Delphi?
[62:01.64]One more.
[62:04.49]I think I can put on some tier three real quick.
[62:08.09]I have another dev suggestion.
[62:10.00]You guys want to hear it?
[62:11.12]Yeah.
[62:12.10]What if you can move when you're down?
[62:15.63]Oh, like crawl?
[62:16.61]Yeah.
[62:18.69]Damn.
[62:21.08]I don't know.
[62:21.46]It's Rock'n'Tog time.
[62:22.83]Dude, this guy hasn't even beaten Rock'n'Tog yet.
[62:25.21]I know, we gotta beat Rock'n'Tog before we- I think we gotta beat Rock'n'Tog before.
[62:27.75]We do this, we go back to Belfry, we upgrade, and then Rock'n'Tog.
[62:30.36]Because I bet Rock'n'Tog is probably gonna be hard.
[62:31.92]That's true.
[62:32.18]There's no way Rock'n'Tog is a walk in the park.
[62:34.08]That's what I'm saying.
[62:35.84]I think we have to beat Rock'n'Tog without any issue before we give any suggestions, I think.
[62:42.07]Oh, yeah.
[62:42.77]The devs, their line is closed until Rock'n'Tog.
[62:46.04]They're probably sitting there going, these guys are talking like this and they haven't even beaten Rockentog.
[62:50.51]Sorry, Wheatfield.
[62:53.65]Brambles.
[62:55.52]And walk around.
[62:58.32]Wait, you can walk around?
[63:02.12]Right.
[63:04.17]Rockentog.
[63:09.01]What's that call out?
[63:10.11]There he is.
[63:11.50]Get him.
[63:11.92]That's Rockentog.
[63:12.62]That's him.
[63:14.00]And wait, they're all Rockentog.
[63:16.15]Are they all coming from this direction?
[63:17.79]Do we have confirmation on that?
[63:18.97]I think so.
[63:23.76]Be careful you don't step on the brambles.
[63:25.62]They are not all coming from this direction!
[63:27.38]Ooh!
[63:27.64]Red alert!
[63:31.29]Oh shit, they're really not.
[63:38.52]The 10!
[63:39.44]We gotta group them up.
[63:42.16]Here, I'll fight in the gap in the fence.
[63:45.36]You guys clean up the ones in the middle.
[63:48.80]I'm going to get rock and tog.
[63:53.73]I'm just going crazy right here.
[63:58.11]The fence is useful.
[63:59.37]I'm realizing.
[64:00.09]Yeah, we probably should.
[64:01.35]I love the instinct is just to smash it.
[64:03.50]Yeah.
[64:04.68]It's alright.
[64:07.10]No.
[64:08.30]I walked into the grass.
[64:10.44]No.
[64:11.59]You died from the grass.
[64:13.51]No.
[64:14.01]I had one HP.
[64:15.99]I got you.
[64:16.53]I got you.
[64:17.53]Rock and talk is a tough fucking fight, dude.
[64:19.13]I get it.
[64:19.51]Don't worry.
[64:24.04]Alright.
[64:24.26]I'll watch this side.
[64:25.04]Two and two.
[64:26.28]Guys, that's all.
[64:26.98]That's four of you.
[64:29.10]I'm going to go where you are to figure out how much damage you're doing.
[64:33.89]Alright.
[64:34.53]All these guys clumped together.
[64:35.97]I thought they were just another enemy falling from the sky, jumping down at us.
[64:39.92]They were clumped together.
[64:40.80]They made one unit.
[64:43.16]That was crazy looking.
[64:46.50]Wait, really?
[64:46.94]On your screen it looked like that?
[64:47.98]It looked wild.
[64:52.98]I see we blew them up with their own bomb.
[64:54.99]Dude, we're getting the tech.
[64:56.89]Yeah.
[64:57.11]This is the kind of stuff you learn when you're near Worryford.
[65:04.00]I'm just trying to do air combos.
[65:04.94]One leaked.
[65:05.74]One leaked.
[65:06.36]Rock'n'Tog on the tent.
[65:07.62]I'm hailing him.
[65:09.08]Come on.
[65:14.41]We got three more Rock'n'Togs on the left.
[65:31.92]You know that Jerry killed and they shot him?
[65:33.63]Actually, they can walk on these things too.
[65:34.83]That's actually pretty useful.
[65:36.61]I'm just, I'm doing the air blast to knock him on back.
[65:42.27]One more wave.
[65:42.73]I'm holding the right side.
[65:44.94]Yeah, let's do two and two, two and two.
[65:46.48]Me and Jerry will take right.
[65:48.16]Last wave.
[65:49.18]It's my last eel.
[65:57.69]Oh boy.
[66:04.91]Uh-oh.
[66:05.93]That hurt a lot.
[66:09.72]Oh, no.
[66:11.06]Oh!
[66:11.76]I'm down!
[66:12.32]Jerry, I can't get you yet.
[66:15.71]Yeah, sometimes my guy does the gun move and I'm stuck.
[66:19.01]There's a rat coming on the right.
[66:21.54]Yeah.
[66:28.35]You got combos too, Criken.
[66:30.19]You're making us look bad.
[66:33.35]Well, everyone's got combos.
[66:34.81]Yeah, but you're like hitting them.
[66:36.35]You're doing like the full rotation.
[66:39.24]I think it's also just that the Shadow Striker looks like they're always doing a combo because they attack so fast.
[66:43.60]Just say you're better than us.
[66:45.11]I'm not going to do that.
[66:46.21]I'm just, I'm not going to do that.
[66:47.73]Put rank one in your title.
[66:53.16]Shadow Striker is fun though.
[66:55.34]Yeah, absolutely.
[66:57.85]Oh.
[66:59.05]Oh, the hut.
[67:00.21]Yeah, we got some rocking dogs in the hut.
[67:02.56]I'm still down over here, by the way, if you guys want to help.
[67:04.76]I think I got you.
[67:06.02]They're hutting.
[67:06.52]They're hutting.
[67:08.65]I'm right to the hut.
[67:09.51]I'm right to the hut.
[67:11.29]Crazy res.
[67:20.32]I'm going to use the healing potion on the tent.
[67:23.21]You poured over the tent.
[67:28.94]It's just stained now.
[67:30.52]It's stained.
[67:30.98]It's stained.
[67:31.84]You guys alright?
[67:33.46]I stayed in the tent.
[67:34.42]That was a crazy juggle, but I died for it.
[67:37.40]I got you.
[67:37.66]We actually went crazy.
[67:38.70]Yeah, we actually went crazy.
[67:39.30]Rockethog's on it.
[67:39.78]Rockethog's on it.
[67:41.01]On your guys' side.
[67:42.51]I got her.
[67:43.41]I got a revive.
[67:45.11]I'm talking about that was crazy.
[67:47.13]They won't know about that, but we went insane.
[67:48.89]No, they will not know, but at least we got damage.
[67:51.94]That combo was sick.
[67:53.48]I knocked the right up and started like a fucking pile driver down to Earth.
[67:57.88]The people's elbow.
[67:59.22]Yeah, that was sick.
[68:00.53]That kind of got rough.
[68:01.47]I think we're kind of like almost dead.
[68:04.71]Hey, Rocketog.
[68:07.43]Oh my goodness.
[68:08.31]I thought I was done for.
[68:10.00]Man, we're like in each other's brains.
[68:12.68]Am I you or are you the other guy?
[68:15.74]It's the mind sickness.
[68:16.75]Oh, a blue.
[68:21.51]I just got freaking greens, man.
[68:26.18]I'm just saying, oh, a blue every time.
[68:32.35]I'm following your lead.
[68:33.41]Somebody asked about House Slipper.
[68:34.89]Alright, back to Bell 3.
[68:35.92]Round 2 is confirmed to be the 24th at 12pm Pacific.
[68:40.32]Absolutely.
[68:42.10]Let me go change my name and my person.
[68:44.93]I enjoy this game a lot.
[68:46.01]Just got some confirmation.
[68:47.01]Should we do like a whole transformation?
[68:48.43]Should be fun.
[68:49.01]Yeah.
[68:51.40]You gonna have a real glow up?
[68:53.86]I need blues, man.
[68:57.31]Yes!
[68:57.61]Okay, I can use my new weapon.
[68:58.51]I'm gonna be unstoppable now.
[69:12.48]I'm going to equip the rock and sock and boppers for rock and tog.
[69:21.01]So we are to confirm doing a hangout in town and get stuff situated, right?
[69:26.48]Yes.
[69:30.79]Is bleed burn?
[69:33.93]That's a different status effect.
[69:37.07]I think it's kind of crazy.
[69:37.76]Oh, burn is different.
[69:38.44]You're right.
[69:38.98]Yeah.
[69:46.84]How do I put the... Man, I'm a commoner.
[69:59.87]Make sure you guys all pick a revive ally time reduction on your gear for me, thanks.
[70:03.95]Thanks.
[70:07.60]I've been skipping that because of you.
[70:12.28]Weird.
[70:13.14]My LG then.
[70:20.74]so you can get tier different higher tier common items and uncommon ones that's funny so I've seen I've seen tier two common and like tier three common I'm going sicko mode I wonder if it's better to have the gear score or actually have the damage or the defense probably the damage or defense right yeah I think tier's first and then rarity's second in terms of like prioritizing
[70:50.79]dude look at that I'm not sure I I think I'm done I think I'm I think I'm ready I'm not ready but will be
[71:14.98]uh poke if if you go into your move set if you go down there's a standard move set section where you put in skills maybe it says how the gun works looking oh I'm decked out now need more freaking spirit dust maybe somewhere or something oh I want that
[71:43.65]What's better, explosive daggers or this big dash forward Criken?
[71:50.87]I'm using the dash right now, but I like the explosive daggers a lot.
[71:53.88]So you can try it out whichever one you like.
[71:57.48]I think I like the explosives a little too much.
[72:03.13]Nerf said study up little bro, okay?
[72:06.89]Yeah, I sent you a paper, a research paper on how you're playing.
[72:11.50]Yeah, I know.
[72:11.90]Analyzing your gameplay.
[72:13.77]I'm trying.
[72:16.61]I find a poison.
[72:20.17]Guess I can get them both.
[72:32.60]I can see how eventually you're going to potentially run out of points to get everything.
[72:39.45]Yeah.
[72:41.35]I am running to that now.
[72:43.10]How much dust do y'all have?
[72:44.26]I'll never have enough.
[72:47.02]I just spent it all, yeah.
[72:49.99]I'm getting the run back on the tier 3 guy and he is not looking good.
[72:56.46]Oh yeah?
[73:02.36]We need so many resources here.
[73:11.85]Yeah, dismantling is the best way to get dust, absolutely.
[73:24.45]I've learned the tech.
[73:26.79]The bulk dismantle doesn't work?
[73:28.84]Why sometimes?
[73:30.96]You need to exit bulk mode after you've selected everything, I think.
[73:34.68]It trips me up a little.
[73:38.43]like you mark everything and then at the bottom it says the buttons and there is an exit mark mode and then the dismantle damn it I need 10 more dust come on alright I've I've that was actually very helpful to learn what is doing the most damage for me
[74:07.29]danger three down I can't just I can't bulk they're all marked oh wait it's favorite then you press oh you're marking favorites yeah oh they do that so oh I did that too it actually is a really good system there because it allows you to because how many sometimes if you don't do that you might just delete that you might have actually wanted to keep I almost did
[74:34.84]So if you mark it with a star... You're gonna have one for your money on DPS this time.
[74:38.71]Oh yeah?
[74:41.09]Bring it on.
[74:43.78]Alright, I'm good.
[74:44.34]I'm ready.
[74:45.92]Same.
[74:46.14]I'm not.
[74:47.92]I've upgraded my stuff.
[74:49.00]I have the PP2.
[74:57.19]You're going to play Dracula on Sunday?
[74:58.29]Yeah, Dracula 3 is going to be Sunday.
[75:03.84]Probably going to have a couple of beers or something.
[75:05.34]Yes, I'll beat the tier 4 guy then.
[75:09.09]But yeah, again.
[75:09.63]Oh, never mind.
[75:10.31]Gear score 300.
[75:12.07]I think there's only about five or six hours or maybe six.
[75:15.90]But as of now, seven hours left on the free to play here.
[75:20.35]Powerborn.
[75:20.92]It's on Steam.
[75:21.72]It's on Xbox.
[75:23.10]It is on... I thought he was laughing at me, but I am muted, so he's not laughing at me.
[75:30.87]It's on Xbox.
[75:31.85]It's on Steam.
[75:32.39]You put gems in the gear?
[75:33.62]Game Pass as well.
[75:34.96]It's on Game Pass right now.
[75:35.98]Or is that later on?
[75:38.70]Anything you do, we'll carry over out of the free-to-play period here tomorrow.
[75:42.19]They have a slot.
[75:43.11]You can put it in there.
[75:47.26]Alright, I'm in the bathroom.
[75:48.12]Five seconds.
[75:55.39]When do we get other umbras?
[75:56.77]Do you guys know?
[75:58.25]Have you found one yet?
[76:01.18]I feel like there's a couple other things, systems we haven't seen yet, which is that those aspects, we haven't really been able to use them yet.
[76:12.82]I could use them.
[76:14.10]Oh, no, we can't.
[76:14.72]Okay, now I have it now.
[76:18.15]Yeah, so I have a tier 3 one, and I think if I go to my gear, I can slot it in if that gear has a slot for it.
[76:25.02]Oh, cool.
[76:25.88]Okay.
[76:26.58]Well, here we go.
[76:32.63]That's pretty good.
[76:39.64]They add a ton of gear score too.
[76:41.96]Oh, yeah.
[76:45.88]I'll take this one.
[76:49.59]So you don't put them in, you just slot them.
[76:52.95]So you don't have to pull it out.
[76:54.56]You just have to activate them.
[76:56.56]That's cool.
[76:57.26]Yeah, I think you slot them and you take them out when you need to.
[77:00.51]I just hit 300 gear score now from putting in aspects.
[77:06.70]While we wait, I'm going to try to do this tier three.
[77:15.64]You have to find a second Umbra in-game, then you unlock the ability to choose other ones you've gotten.
[77:20.31]So we have to find one.
[77:23.29]Okay.
[77:23.81]I guess, like, as a loot drop or maybe from a quest?
[77:25.78]It might just... It's possible it might just be on the map somewhere.
[77:27.88]Like, it might be a quest or a map drop or something.
[77:37.83]Alright, let me destroy this guy now.
[77:47.64]Wait, what?
[77:48.56]Yeah, on the map, you can just find a tile that has loot on it.
[77:52.00]Yeah.
[77:53.19]Like, I just got Spirit Dust from a tile.
[77:58.67]Yeah, the tile system seems to not just be, this is a level you pick.
[78:01.80]It's, you can make your way towards chests and gear on the ground and... Oh, he's still kind of kicking my...
[78:26.37]I gotta get that poison on him.
[78:29.11]Here we go.
[78:43.15]Alright, yeah, I should be able to get him now.
[78:45.31]Two minutes.
[78:52.56]No, don't kill me please!
[78:57.10]Are you guys dying?
[78:58.70]I'm doing the challenge thing.
[79:01.41]Oh.
[79:08.94]Best of luck.
[79:12.03]Rooting for you.
[79:14.97]I'm kind of doing worse than I did last time.
[79:16.53]I'm not locked in at all.
[79:36.84]Should I try the boss?
[79:38.30]We're about to go once he's done.
[79:43.06]Should be quick.
[79:44.37]Should get it here in a second.
[79:45.83]He should be dead soon.
[79:48.75]Don't say that.
[79:49.43]It's going to happen.
[79:58.26]Alright, I got it.
[80:01.70]That was actually much harder than I thought it was going to be.
[80:08.34]Yeah, it's interesting to have, like, DPS checks to prevent you from getting, like, speedrunning through the entire game.
[80:15.38]That gives you a ton of dust.
[80:16.36]Do you know what these, um... are, like, ranks are on the side of the screen?
[80:21.80]Like, 6, 8, 0?
[80:23.28]Why are you a 0?
[80:24.59]Uh...
[80:25.30]I think zero is just when they're loading, because it'll change when he's loaded in.
[80:30.21]But our character level is like 17, but what's the difference in the rank?
[80:34.33]It's his ace rank, which I think it may be like a combination of all of your levels across all of your other characters.
[80:41.52]It's like a different leveling thing.
[80:43.26]I don't know what it changes though.
[80:45.82]I think that's maybe your account level.
[80:48.65]Yeah.
[80:50.14]You said I could change my character, right?
[80:51.40]Where's this mirror?
[80:53.21]All the way on the left, bottom left, a very triangular-looking person, I think, was offering it to me.
[81:02.59]Or she said something about it.
[81:06.15]I'm not going to get rid of these things.
[81:07.28]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[81:10.84]And then she's got a salon there.
[81:16.48]I want to take a look at the map now, because now that it said the map, dangerous areas of the map have been unlocked.
[81:22.48]Oh, okay, so this is interesting.
[81:23.82]So now, because before, I couldn't go right of the windmill before, but now I think you can.
[81:31.94]Let me see.
[81:36.89]yeah that's how we're alright so I couldn't walk down here it was a big three right here so you have to prove yeah you gotta prove you're good enough to go the other ways so now I can actually go this way yeah let's go alright is everyone ready want to do some some rock and tag uh almost yeah I'm about to be ready in a moment because I thought that was account level or character level or something but it's not it is your danger level
[82:07.04]If we complete Rock and Tog, we unlock Ratkin armor and weapons.
[82:14.31]This is huge.
[82:15.43]That is kind of huge.
[82:28.27]So each one of these little zone areas has its own kind of loot you can get to.
[82:34.50]That's cool.
[82:35.66]You can only change your name once.
[82:37.10]Oh, man.
[82:38.23]What are you going to change it to?
[82:39.89]I was trying to change it to POKE, all caps.
[82:43.09]You should change it to The Master of Destruction.
[82:46.88]I should?
[82:48.36]I can't.
[82:49.74]Oh.
[82:51.26]It doesn't let you.
[82:53.42]It's already naming the game.
[82:54.97]It's one of the NPCs.
[83:00.57]Alright.
[83:00.97]You ready, Rakintog?
[83:02.70]I think I'm as ready as I'm going to be.
[83:05.36]Recommend a gear score 263.
[83:08.39]This is not going to be a walk in the park.
[83:10.21]Oh, man.
[83:11.28]Are you guys good for this?
[83:12.56]I'm at 266.
[83:13.50]What is everybody else?
[83:15.93]219.
[83:16.35]300.
[83:17.51]Okay.
[83:18.94]Damn, you're like the movie.
[83:32.83]I do like the music.
[83:33.66]It's very chill.
[83:35.84]Yeah, it's beautiful.
[83:39.22]I hear fighting and I'm not fighting.
[83:41.49]Okay, there we go.
[83:42.01]Oh, here we go.
[83:42.79]Oh, I didn't save.
[83:44.23]I didn't save my character.
[83:46.27]After all that?
[83:48.45]Yeah.
[83:48.76]Yeah, I literally did the same thing.
[83:50.90]Oh, okay, cool.
[83:54.64]I panicked and discarded to join you guys.
[83:57.73]I kind of look like I'm about to go paintballing.
[84:01.25]This is like a paintball outfit.
[84:05.05]One of my favorite things in any RPG is when you're early to mid-game and your gear is all mismatching and there's absolutely no coordinated sets or anything.
[84:15.84]You're wearing a green cap and leather jerkin and iron boots.
[84:22.45]Yeah, you just look like a total idiot.
[84:24.91]Yeah.
[84:25.67]Good times.
[84:27.93]Imagine dressing for the best gear.
[84:33.16]fashion is end game is this actually this is rock and talk is the boss here yes the rat boss don't keep those flasks at maximum yeah no mistakes no accidental discharges I saw that I'm watching everyone who am I wait am I me
[85:06.46]Dude, the fire art is so nice.
[85:10.81]Dude, I think there's like a bird on my window.
[85:14.95]That's so cute.
[85:18.08]In real life?
[85:18.78]Yeah.
[85:19.82]Plus one viewer.
[85:22.89]He's just sitting here singing.
[85:25.05]I turned to the left and right outside my window.
[85:26.75]There's a hut all the way in the back here on the other side.
[85:28.96]Oh, good shout.
[85:31.13]There was just like a giant raven staring right at me, like perched right outside my window.
[85:36.62]It really felt like an omen for something.
[85:38.72]That's so cool.
[85:48.43]There's a man out my window just staring at me.
[85:54.28]Wait, you get all your stuff back from that.
[86:00.14]Oh my god, those guys just flew.
[86:03.58]Big punch.
[86:10.37]They're almost going so far that the game is not able to render them going that far.
[86:15.84]You are punching them so much.
[86:17.32]Exiting your screen.
[86:18.50]Yeah, they're going off of your screen and kind of getting trapped.
[86:21.59]I'm following them.
[86:22.83]I died!
[86:23.19]Maybe I'm punching them away from you, but I'm just enjoying punching them that far.
[86:28.03]This game kind of reminds me of those old arcade cabinets.
[86:31.03]You know, like The Simpsons beat-em-ups.
[86:35.02]Oh, they're adding Marge?
[86:36.52]Confirmed?
[86:38.01]Marge with the vacuum?
[86:40.93]Oh, yeah.
[86:43.39]The spin around with the vacuum move was... That was her thing.
[86:48.62]I guess the staying power of playing a game like this is... I guess it's just...
[86:55.20]if you like beat-em-ups and you like playing games like that they're kind of just adding a bunch of shit and it's just gonna be you just play a beat-em-up I think especially with all the different classes I mean it seems like you can customize them a lot so if they add more classes later down the line then there's always like another thing to try I like the world map wait this is messed up I let the one person out of the steel cage but there's no interact with this oh no you can't let this person out
[87:27.84]Yeah, the quest said save refugee singular, so... Oh, no.
[87:32.20]Wait, break it?
[87:33.12]Oh, you have to beat it up.
[87:34.39]Oh.
[87:35.35]Well, this feels violent.
[87:36.27]We're about to leave this girl.
[87:39.49]How did you open the gate instead of just... I guess I'll beat this one up.
[87:48.93]Yeah, the other one has, like, a key, an iron key lock on it, and I opened that one.
[87:53.73]I'm applying poison to this cage.
[87:57.11]I feel like I'm so much squishier than you guys.
[88:00.58]Gotta get that gear up.
[88:01.66]Gotta get that gear score up.
[88:03.77]I mean, maybe.
[88:05.27]I know Rockbreaker has some tanky stuff.
[88:09.01]I think it's because I was behind in levels.
[88:12.24]That too.
[88:16.07]I do like the world map.
[88:17.15]I think that's fun.
[88:18.27]Kind of running in a random direction and getting stuff.
[88:22.93]And his boss is on it too.
[88:24.11]I wonder if that big blue kind of bear looking thing is an event.
[88:29.12]Is it there permanently?
[88:30.26]Is it not there permanently?
[88:31.02]That's cool.
[88:31.61]Man, you see those mountains in the background?
[88:33.89]Yeah.
[88:34.95]You can go there.
[88:36.23]What?
[88:38.70]Fuck.
[88:38.82]Oh, that's a fence.
[88:41.68]You guys are all the way back.
[88:42.90]Oh, you guys are still bashing.
[88:43.98]Yeah, I was like, wow, this mob is like chilling.
[88:51.70]Watch out, mob.
[88:54.25]Somebody said, oh, cool, they've got content coming soon.
[88:56.44]Check it out.
[88:59.62]Like this, like, chameleon-looking guy.
[89:11.18]I'm almost dead from one hit.
[89:14.20]Keep him up, keep him up, keep him up.
[89:16.21]Oh, wait, I have this move this whole time.
[89:17.29]I never use this.
[89:20.37]Let that one hit be a lesson to you.
[89:23.41]Don't let him down.
[89:23.99]Don't let him down.
[89:24.74]Oh, my God.
[89:25.40]We're going crazy.
[89:26.46]It's like that game you play with a balloon.
[89:27.60]Don't let it hit the floor.
[89:29.50]I think I tried to punch them up.
[89:31.59]It didn't work.
[89:32.09]So I think there might be a limit.
[89:40.71]Oh, keep them up.
[89:41.29]Keep up.
[89:42.77]Yeah.
[89:43.55]See?
[89:45.84]Why am I dying?
[89:47.84]I'm poisoned.
[89:48.54]The grass?
[89:49.74]There it goes.
[89:51.71]Yeah, the poison has a weird red on it.
[89:53.13]Oh, no.
[89:56.27]Oh, refill.
[89:57.89]Oh, thank God.
[89:59.31]Oh, it only gives you one refill, I think.
[90:02.98]Thank you, Stoic, for that heal.
[90:06.70]Uh-oh.
[90:09.04]Marcus loves this.
[90:11.67]Get that tent.
[90:19.78]Can't get Tent too busy comboing one guy.
[90:23.16]We have a timer on this.
[90:24.06]Oh, Tent!
[90:24.56]Tent!
[90:25.38]Destroy the supplies.
[90:29.17]I guess that's like all the stuff around the area?
[90:31.55]Okay.
[90:35.48]Is it just kind of everything?
[90:40.11]Supplies destroyed timer yet.
[90:42.03]Oh, shoot.
[90:42.93]I just ran ahead.
[90:43.91]It's kind of just, yeah, it's just everything.
[90:49.19]If it has a health bar or if it's on the ground, destroy it.
[90:52.25]Two more.
[90:53.51]Are we missing anything back there?
[90:55.60]I'll go back.
[90:56.28]I'll go back.
[90:59.24]Molting.
[91:01.08]It'll count.
[91:01.58]It's back there.
[91:02.18]It'll count.
[91:02.76]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[91:03.49]I got, yep, I got one.
[91:04.35]I guess the fence is not a supply.
[91:05.95]That makes sense.
[91:06.51]I got it, I got it.
[91:07.01]You did it.
[91:07.65]Chest back here.
[91:08.49]Oh, I was... Rats, that's your blood letter.
[91:10.85]I was locked in.
[91:11.60]I don't know.
[91:12.48]There's a chest back there if anybody wants it.
[91:15.14]Yeah, sure.
[91:18.31]Yeah, you lied.
[91:19.74]Is there no chest back there for you?
[91:23.28]Yeah, we'll talk later.
[91:25.49]You want to pad your damage stats.
[91:26.85]I get it.
[91:29.31]I'm out.
[91:32.30]Wait, I just realized you could use a flask to heal yourself when you're down.
[91:36.39]It's part of your... I think you have to unlock it.
[91:39.65]Oh, really?
[91:41.45]Yeah.
[91:48.96]Oh, I altered it the worst time.
[91:52.94]I'm so mad at myself for that, actually.
[91:55.97]Oh, don't worry about it.
[91:57.29]He's going to be in bed tonight.
[91:59.75]I should have altered.
[92:02.71]This is where you do it here.
[92:05.18]Yeah.
[92:11.98]Good DPS, lads.
[92:15.23]I just got caught.
[92:27.28]oh I think the the red is you kind of can't maybe I probably can't parry it oh I dodged into it no thank you prince Chris you're very welcome oh are we tired another chance
[93:01.34]Stack that poison on him.
[93:02.86]He's got 10 stacks of poison on him.
[93:04.72]Oh my god.
[93:05.32]I think he restunned.
[93:07.38]Yeah, I did some crazy thing, I think.
[93:10.11]Wow.
[93:11.19]Excellent.
[93:11.49]Nice job.
[93:22.96]I saw that done blast.
[93:25.16]So there was no chest back here.
[93:27.52]There was a chest back here.
[93:30.13]I was gaming so hard right there.
[93:31.33]I think everyone's gaming a little too hard.
[93:34.57]It's OK.
[93:37.09]Yeah, I that was we game so hard my computer is overheating.
[93:40.16]Oh.
[93:41.46]We did it.
[93:42.78]Go after an adult.
[93:45.14]That was quite a few blues and I'm going to.
[93:47.60]I'm going to address that because it was a lot.
[93:51.89]Oh OK, was it too?
[93:54.33]It's like 5.
[93:56.70]Whoa.
[93:57.80]Ratkins daggers.
[93:59.27]This is... Yeah, we got cosmetic.
[94:02.31]We get to be rats.
[94:05.60]Yo, level 21.
[94:06.70]On the map, if you want it to, like, because there's set bonuses, it shows you what drops in certain zones before you choose it as well.
[94:17.35]Oh, cool.
[94:18.67]New skill point.
[94:19.94]I guess that's a rat world.
[94:21.64]Oh, I didn't see my stats.
[94:22.76]Did I do terrible?
[94:24.30]Oh, I didn't look either.
[94:26.14]Oh.
[94:27.08]You did great.
[94:27.86]Yeah, no, I'm looking at it right now.
[94:29.12]No one looked at me.
[94:30.94]Thanks, guys.
[94:33.55]No one looked at me.
[94:36.71]Look at me.
[94:38.05]I'm looking.
[94:43.46]What are those?
[94:44.44]What are the rat daggers?
[94:46.51]Are they good?
[94:46.97]They're cosmetic.
[94:47.77]So if you just press start and then hold A on your gear.
[94:52.92]Oh, are they?
[94:54.22]If not, I'm not sure yet.
[94:56.31]Were they not just daggers for the dagger character?
[95:00.95]Well, I think they have a rat for everything, right?
[95:04.37]Oh, this was.
[95:06.00]It's not a cosmetic.
[95:07.92]Oh, it's not?
[95:08.44]It's an actual dagger?
[95:09.14]It's an actual dagger.
[95:16.59]I mean, they're cool, but... I think these are better.
[95:22.89]I already upgraded these anyways.
[95:33.43]I almost want to put this on I almost look like a character from uh like monty python poison mode oh we going back oh yeah we got to go back gotta tell them of our deeds taking a new skill though
[96:05.63]Oh, just a drop from the area?
[96:08.47]Yeah, because I didn't get any rat trackers.
[96:13.92]Oh, you actually need to buy this.
[96:18.49]The rising strike thing where you pop back up after getting hit on the ground?
[96:22.25]Yeah, that's skill points.
[96:23.69]That's kind of huge.
[96:24.96]I hear the voices in my ear.
[96:32.17]There's voices to the right.
[96:33.07]You guys hear that?
[96:35.63]Voices?
[96:36.85]I see a crowd to the right.
[96:41.92]In this menu.
[96:42.46]You gotta be in this menu, I think.
[96:52.32]I'm gonna go with my Curio.
[96:57.17]We need more Ritz.
[96:58.83]Whoa.
[96:59.97]That guy's a wolf.
[97:00.65]I need Ritz, too.
[97:03.51]Wolfram.
[97:04.23]He wants me to complete that hollow grass steps.
[97:13.50]No.
[97:20.45]We don't.
[97:22.01]We want to go next.
[97:26.55]Did we kill the big the big big rat boss?
[97:28.13]Was that that was the big big rat boss?
[97:30.15]I think that was the big big rat boss.
[97:32.04]Yes.
[97:37.46]Where do you put the gems in?
[97:40.13]HP regeneration gear.
[97:43.29]Need that.
[97:44.27]You go to your, it's only a certain gear that has like a little like triangle or a square next to it.
[97:48.82]And you go to that in your equip menu.
[97:51.72]And then there's like the Y button, triangle button.
[97:54.96]Dude, the Ratkin set gear is really good.
[97:58.13]Yeah, you can put aspects and other things besides weapons, by the way, as long as it has a slot.
[98:03.78]Ah, how was I missing that?
[98:07.90]oh yeah I got a rakan sword and shield but not dagger I see so I need to like grind getting I see oh they're not consumed either I was making some wild assumptions guys
[98:39.43]Why?
[98:40.99]I thought the slots got consumed and I wasn't using them.
[98:44.93]Rattkin's so good for daggers.
[98:52.08]Well, I'm ready, I think.
[98:53.74]Soon.
[98:54.04]I'm ready.
[98:55.15]You know what?
[98:55.45]I'm ready.
[98:56.31]I only got two Rattkin gears.
[98:59.09]Yeah, me too.
[99:00.97]No, I wanted the tier three.
[99:02.21]I wanted the set bonus.
[99:04.30]The set bonus looks so good.
[99:06.66]Could get them again.
[99:08.86]Could run back the rack stuff if you want to try to get more rack gear.
[99:12.62]It's true.
[99:15.84]Is it only from Rackintog or can we get it from?
[99:18.45]There might be those like chests around him so we could do different missions.
[99:25.75]But like when you're on the world map and you walk over something, I think there's an info button to see what drops.
[99:30.82]Yeah.
[99:32.18]So far it seems like it's only the Rackintog, but.
[99:35.82]If we keep going this way, we can get to the big pangolin dragon.
[99:39.83]Big blue guy.
[99:42.23]Yeah, let's go.
[99:42.72]Let's do the big blue guy.
[99:45.00]Alright, we gotta do a couple more missions to get there, but... That seems like something we should do.
[99:49.45]Let me know when you're ready, and I'll throw it up.
[99:51.49]Can you customize your characters' faces?
[99:52.77]Yes.
[99:53.87]Actually, there's a lot more options than you might think there are.
[99:56.30]All of us have totally customized characters.
[100:01.68]I do think the face customization is one of the best parts, because you can even move tattoos around.
[100:05.90]I moved a tattoo that is two white almond-shaped things, and I turned them into eyes, so I have kind of cartoony eye holes, you know?
[100:17.95]Yeah, it looks like there's a lot of little things you can do.
[100:19.58]This guy's got eyes?
[100:21.28]I got eyes, but they're all tattoos, actually.
[100:22.88]It's fake.
[100:24.76]How do you guys put the gem in the gear?
[100:28.41]Uh...
[100:30.50]Press start, go to the gear, and then press X for aspects.
[100:34.94]My guy does look so messed up.
[100:36.72]He really does.
[100:39.43]Oh.
[100:42.25]Boy, that's huge.
[100:44.59]I think if you guys didn't from the request board, you can also take more stuff.
[100:54.94]Yeah, I think I'm on two or three side missions that I haven't really done.
[100:58.85]Oh, this is where you get... We need... This is the Ritz.
[101:01.59]Give me all these.
[101:06.68]Give it to him.
[101:08.30]Wait, I have a legendary founder gem.
[101:11.29]What?
[101:12.07]Gives me one flask use, damage, HP.
[101:15.54]What the?
[101:20.95]Yeah, three at a time can be activated.
[101:22.17]That's cool.
[101:24.48]Alright, we gotta kill that big giant thing.
[101:26.70]That's gotta be the culmination of this whole entire stream, right?
[101:29.93]Let me get moving.
[101:32.15]Let's move it.
[101:34.45]Ready?
[101:37.22]This one should be easy.
[101:38.08]It's a low gear score.
[101:43.00]Are you ready, Cherrykill?
[101:45.49]Yes.
[101:51.65]Man, thank you, Stoick!
[101:53.79]the developers behind Towerborn for sponsoring this stream.
[101:58.44]Towerborn is available on Steam and Xbox now!
[102:02.78]Also on Game Pass as well.
[102:06.43]Roll down and click the thingy.
[102:08.27]You know, I have been called Mr. Game Pass before.
[102:12.47]Really?
[102:13.33]Yeah, by somebody in this call.
[102:17.46]By many people.
[102:20.42]Rats!
[102:21.12]They're rats.
[102:22.28]They're attacking.
[102:24.59]I think that's got to be one of my favorite cultural contributions you've made to the world, Jerma.
[102:39.47]Did you ever hear the new one that I never released?
[102:42.17]No, I have not heard the new one.
[102:44.01]I'd love to hear it.
[102:45.55]Did you hear the unreleased tape?
[102:47.75]Yeah, I don't have access to your computer, so I have not heard it.
[102:52.69]If I ever had another one, I was going to do it.
[102:54.83]It was going to be, you know, not a big deal.
[102:58.30]It was going to go a little something like this.
[103:02.18]Where the rats?
[103:02.72]Where the rats?
[103:03.26]Yes, where the rats?
[103:04.53]Where they at?
[103:05.07]Where they at?
[103:05.61]Yeah, where the rats?
[103:07.01]Where the rats?
[103:07.59]Where the rats?
[103:08.09]Yes, where the rats?
[103:09.15]Where they at?
[103:09.65]Where they at?
[103:10.17]Where they at?
[103:10.67]Where they at?
[103:13.30]Ooh, I like that.
[103:13.78]A little bit of a mystery, that one.
[103:14.90]Where the rats?
[103:15.46]Where the rats?
[103:16.10]Yes, where are the rats, right?
[103:18.51]Where are the rats?
[103:19.95]Where are the... Yeah, where they at?
[103:22.52]Yeah.
[103:22.68]Who let the rats out?
[103:25.11]Yeah, yeah.
[103:25.37]It's got the same energies with the rats out.
[103:27.31]Well, that's a classic.
[103:27.97]Where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where the

[104:36.02]I found my support role.
[104:37.30]I gotta address this.
[104:38.27]Somebody said you stole that from a fan remix.
[104:42.93]Oh.
[104:44.50]Remixing yourself?
[104:46.54]It's me that sung the song!
[104:53.01]Why do you think they got the audio track?
[104:57.28]Oh, that's a blue.
[105:01.14]That's a lot of rats.
[105:02.46]I'm just trying to punch them in the left corner.
[105:03.96]You guys are punching them this way.
[105:05.90]You guys are punching them this way and I'm trying to clean up the room and get them all that way on the wall.
[105:15.05]Ah, forget it.
[105:18.21]Forget it.
[105:19.46]Yeah, forget it.
[105:30.01]Boom.

[106:32.82]Whoa.
[106:33.88]Yeah, you're stepping up.
[106:35.50]I learned a strategy.
[106:37.82]That's huge.
[106:38.38]Can we go?
[106:38.60]Do you want to see my new character?
[106:42.21]Yeah.
[106:42.49]We're going to keep moving because we want to get to that Pandolin.
[106:45.59]Yeah, let's keep going.
[106:46.28]We got to get to that.
[106:47.40]We're all really growing into our style.
[106:53.37]We're just trying new things, experimenting.
[106:58.79]have to go around this way somebody said you stole the sus guy you just made me hurt my I just broke my teeth because I got so angry what about the loot rush expert uh you could do that after if you had time but I think getting the the pendulum would be fun right right so are you guys loaded or still waiting
[107:22.89]I'm in town.
[107:24.79]I'm in town.
[107:25.17]Ready?
[107:26.21]Okay.
[107:26.55]I'm ready for anything.
[107:27.21]Did you guys hear the ice crunch?
[107:28.58]Because if you didn't, what I just did makes no sense.
[107:31.32]You say where to go and what to punch, and I'll punch it.
[107:33.96]Handling.
[107:36.48]You didn't?
[107:36.84]Well, let me try it again.
[107:38.69]You stole the sus guy from somebody.
[107:40.45]I didn't steal... Ow.
[107:42.91]I... Up, down, left, right.
[107:45.77]Punch.
[107:46.58]Just edit it together.
[107:54.58]Yeah, I wasn't ready.
[107:55.80]Alright, this one is going to be rough.
[108:07.51]Oh, look, a little Pandolin.
[108:10.03]It must be one of those Bangor.
[108:12.15]No, the sus guy was my face, and then somebody just added the giant smile and made me going like, and then I hated it, and I showed it on stream, and I hated it a lot, and then it became a community phenomenon.
[108:26.02]Oh, I can just do this?
[108:26.68]That's how that one worked.
[108:27.26]All the time?
[108:28.18]Yeah, you can charge up.
[108:30.94]Oh.
[108:32.35]Oh, I thought you were cheering us on.
[108:36.31]I thought I had to do it after an attack.
[108:38.94]Oh, that thing is charged up, dude.
[108:40.04]You're going to be doing some crazy damage now.
[108:46.65]Yeah, they should not have told me that.
[108:48.51]They should not have given me that.
[108:50.20]I should have kept that info.
[108:52.30]It's going to be too good.
[108:54.06]Oh, this is too much.
[109:07.68]Those big punch hands are cool.
[109:16.88]I like them a lot.
[109:18.62]I keep saying, but good moveset.
[109:23.10]I really haven't found a single weapon that doesn't feel satisfying.
[109:25.73]I love my class.
[109:33.10]Very satisfying.
[109:39.02]It is fun just to kind of play.
[109:39.98]It's fun just to beat them up.
[109:45.03]Just when I punch them, they go far.
[109:47.91]Collect gear, beat up.
[109:57.46]I feel like the main character with this guy.
[110:03.15]Bam, he's leveled up.
[110:07.57]Is it clear?
[110:09.68]It's clear.
[110:12.64]Oh, crap.
[110:14.00]Overcharged.
[110:14.72]Watch out for these bees.
[110:16.25]Uh-oh.
[110:17.27]Uh-oh.
[110:18.99]Oh.
[110:19.09]Oh, he screwed himself up.
[110:20.45]They put a dot on you?
[110:21.97]Oh, they're chasing you around, dude.
[110:25.20]Yeah, I didn't even do anything.
[110:27.30]They're on me, too.
[110:29.95]I think if you go near them, it just... Oh, that's actually a lot of damage.
[110:34.59]Oh, no.
[110:45.90]Here, sending a guy your way.
[110:48.40]No, you interrupt.
[110:49.44]No, my joke.
[110:50.72]No.
[110:53.00]I'm so embarrassed.
[110:54.94]I waste it again.
[111:05.65]Oh, honey.
[111:07.72]Oh, bother.
[111:11.28]Uh-oh.
[111:12.82]There's bees on all of us.
[111:24.20]I have a question.
[111:24.86]If somebody does the League of Legends laugh out loud face, does that mean that they thought it was funny?
[111:29.55]Does it mean that they thought it was not funny?
[111:32.95]What does the League of Legends laugh out loud face?
[111:35.32]I don't know.
[111:35.70]I can't tell the emotion.
[111:36.48]Is that Jinx?
[111:37.90]Yes.
[111:38.26]I'm seeing.
[111:41.10]I don't know.
[111:41.42]I think they just like League of Legends and are laughing.
[111:44.11]Okay.
[111:44.29]Which is, I know, weird because no one who plays League has ever laughed in their life.
[111:48.77]So I see why you're doubting it.
[111:50.66]But I think it's genuine.
[111:53.01]I think it is genuine.
[111:53.97]It looks like it could be genuine.
[111:58.95]Is it weird I've never seen that?
[112:01.44]You've never seen that?
[112:02.96]I didn't know that was even an emote, yeah.
[112:05.60]Yeah, I just never noticed it.
[112:07.02]Okay, but what if they write Bwahaha after it?
[112:10.49]Ooh, that seems a little sarcastic.
[112:12.59]Yeah.
[112:20.58]They're blah-ha-ha-ing now.
[112:22.06]I kind of like that.
[112:26.31]I like that one.
[112:28.61]I'm going to say it right now.
[112:29.67]The hands-down best laugh you could ever have on Twitch.
[112:34.14]Ever.
[112:35.58]Omega LOL.
[112:36.98]Just the best one.
[112:39.82]I agree.
[112:40.34]I think it's the classic.
[112:42.01]It's the original.
[112:42.91]It can't ever be replaced.
[112:43.89]Dermot got most damage that time.
[112:46.53]Nice job.
[112:47.83]I was whacking some people.
[112:49.27]Damn.
[113:00.04]the original would be lul that's right but of the iterations to that emotion I think omegalo is is my favorite it's pangolin time for ready we're ready oh I I didn't think we'd get there that quick let's get him he's ready you want to go back to I want to get him alright I want to get him

[115:32.62]We're never going to beat the guy.
[115:34.68]JerryKill's got seven potions.
[115:37.02]You have seven potions, Jerry?
[115:39.17]Yeah.
[115:39.51]Yeah.

[115:45.07]Yeah.
[115:47.11]I have the founder thingy.
[115:49.92]Okay, I'm going hard.
[115:52.20]I'm getting top damage, not you guys.
[115:54.89]I'm actually going to try now as hard as I can.
[115:58.61]No, you're supposed to not try this time so I can get it.
[116:02.05]Whoever gets highest damage, 100 subs from the devs.
[116:09.34]Thank you, Stoic.
[116:10.98]Thank you so much, Stoic.
[116:12.41]Thank you, Stoic, guys.
[116:13.47]They don't gotta do that.
[116:14.61]They don't gotta do that.
[116:15.75]I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[116:19.62]But again, thank you, Stoic, for the sponsor.
[116:23.18]And 100 subs.
[116:24.57]Really generous.
[116:26.84]Yeah, I'm going to use the sponsorship to get my own subs.
[116:31.43]Pretend it's from them.
[116:38.20]Is it XDD?
[116:40.47]Is that a good one?
[116:41.87]Yeah, actually, he's good for a while.
[116:46.30]Do you see it?
[116:47.38]Do you guys use the OMS?
[116:48.54]I can't see it.
[116:50.10]Like the little dancing megaloads?
[116:51.68]That's too much for me.
[116:53.05]That's too much for my old brain to look at.
[116:55.27]Yeah, it's so fast.
[116:56.83]Yeah.
[116:58.83]Yeah.
[116:59.51]The what?
[117:00.94]OM.
[117:01.64]It's like dancing megaloads.
[117:03.18]It's really animated.
[117:05.40]Oh, I see.
[117:05.98]Use the explosive barrels to pad your damage.
[117:07.81]Nice.
[117:08.11]I never got that one because it's like, why are you dancing if we're laughing?
[117:12.55]You know what I'm saying?
[117:13.15]Pick a lane, you know?
[117:13.93]A combination of emotions there.
[117:25.02]but the I mean I'll put you guys on the new stuff you know what I mean yeah what's hot right now the aol and msn messenger emotes like I I don't want to change I'll put you guys on what's hot right now uh low that's one low what's that all about it's just a it's a minion spinning popcorn
[117:50.47]I've seen that one.
[117:53.86]It's so dumb because the top left of it has a random circle that just fills up the space.
[117:59.87]I don't know, there's just so much to it.
[118:02.07]Why?
[118:04.15]I feel like in my chat, I see Omega low.
[118:07.28]I feel like we're original over here.
[118:09.46]Hold on, let me rephrase that.
[118:11.93]I feel like we use the originals is what I meant.
[118:15.82]No, no.
[118:16.64]Do you have everything disabled, Jerma?
[118:17.86]That's a diss, but it's a good one.
[118:19.06]I appreciate it.
[118:19.70]It's a good one.
[118:20.16]We need to hear that.
[118:22.41]This is an Omega Lel community over on this side of the pond here or whatever.
[118:27.58]Alright, lock in, lock in, lock in.
[118:30.14]My chat really needed to hear that, Jerma.
[118:32.97]Thank you.
[118:34.13]Not that, hey, yeah, my chat is much more original than everybody else's.
[118:39.70]Guys, my chat spams the sus guy, okay?
[118:46.38]chat doesn't even have emos they do plus one +2 it's so funny because I don't think you guys have spammed the sus guy in like three years by the way I'm throwing shade at you for no reason this guy the sus guy I don't even want to say it the the jupes were all over Twitch you really couldn't go to single chat and not see a jupe
[119:15.61]Those are fun to try to do.
[119:17.45]Yeah.
[119:18.71]That was like the original challenge mode, I feel like.
[119:23.95]There were some other four-parters before.
[119:26.94]Or two-parters, three-parters.
[119:28.94]Yeah, everybody was spamming Star Garfield every channel.
[119:36.25]I've not seen someone in my chat use this emote one time and it's a four-part.
[119:41.23]I don't know.
[119:41.59]I've seen it in three years.
[119:42.70]Wait, it's your emote?
[119:45.73]Yeah.
[119:46.47]And it has nothing.
[119:48.71]That's so funny.
[119:49.35]A dedicated board to it?
[119:50.85]I've never seen it used by anyone ever.
[119:53.68]Oh my god, I have so many of those where it's like a bit you did once and forgot about and it's still there.
[119:58.51]Yeah.
[120:00.47]I gotta do a total recombobulation of all my actual sub emotes.
[120:05.53]Yeah, I just never get around to it.
[120:07.56]We've all been streaming for ages.
[120:09.26]Dude, I have a cryptocurrency joke from like 2015 that is still an emote.
[120:15.90]That's crazy.
[120:30.28]I just remember, you guys know Dyrus?
[120:33.20]Yeah.
[120:33.32]He had an emote, a microwave, and it was like three times bigger for some reason than any emote.
[120:40.23]It was just like that for like a few years.
[120:42.78]It was like bugged out?
[120:44.10]I love that.
[120:45.55]That's crazy.
[120:46.77]That's so awesome.
[120:47.25]It was like 1-800-micro- I don't know what it was, just some big-ass microwave.
[120:53.64]I wish they'd never fixed it.
[120:55.42]Yeah, same.
[121:02.19]I just came into my chat, said, help, and they said, I meant to say hello.
[121:09.34]I have a pet peeve though.
[121:10.40]We're in the mole den.
[121:12.35]Oh shit.
[121:13.75]I'll sit in it and walk in.
[121:17.58]Oh, did not see that coming.
[121:24.37]There's adds too.
[121:26.03]Watch your step.
[121:29.86]Oh man.
[121:34.25]Ooh, that hurts a lot if you get hit by the whole thing.
[121:37.82]Oh my god.
[121:39.06]Not good.
[121:41.10]Oh my god, you're right.
[121:42.46]Oh my!
[121:42.60]Guys, we're screwed!
[121:44.08]We're not screwed.
[121:44.75]We're good, we're good.
[121:45.95]I left.
[121:51.52]Is this our first true challenge?
[121:52.62]Get those poison stacks.
[121:54.66]To no longer be a novice?
[121:56.52]The rings, the rings!
[121:57.60]Oh, those rings!
[121:58.97]Jump.
[121:59.47]You gotta jump it.
[122:02.38]Why am I telling you guys I'm getting the max DPS?
[122:04.40]If you all die, then I win.
[122:08.63]I'm going to die, though.
[122:10.07]We are kind of getting destroyed.
[122:12.78]I'm already out of my heals.
[122:14.76]I'm out of flasks.
[122:21.21]Big jump.
[122:21.99]Rings.
[122:25.62]Burning him.
[122:32.81]Oh!
[122:33.75]Get him, get him, get him!
[122:40.28]We did some damage there, that was good.
[122:42.06]Yeah, yeah.
[122:48.55]Rings!
[122:50.41]Rings, nice.
[122:51.75]Another ring, another ring!
[122:52.54]It's gonna get harder.
[122:54.60]Tons of adds, too.
[122:56.42]The adds die in one hit if you hit them before they don't get out.
[122:59.41]Oh, nice.
[123:00.91]Oh, shit.
[123:02.51]Yeah, I read what the guys were saying in the earlier part of the mission.
[123:07.71]I thought you knew that.
[123:08.63]No, no, no, no.
[123:09.71]That's why I'm not going to have max DPS because I killed them in one hit.
[123:16.80]One.
[123:17.34]Oh, God.
[123:19.81]Ring.
[123:21.97]Ring to.
[123:26.13]That's a bear.
[123:26.77]He comboed me.
[123:29.96]I'm just trying to throw poison on and run away.
[123:37.81]Alright, we have to kill the adds.
[123:40.83]Add.
[123:42.55]This is taking way more than one hit.
[123:44.50]Yeah, he lied.
[123:46.88]We're good, we're good.
[123:48.22]No, they hit stun.
[123:49.26]You only have to hit them once, but they'll hit stun while they're in the ground.
[123:52.61]Just punch them once and walk away.
[123:57.17]Good boy.
[123:58.18]No, it doesn't do that.
[123:59.16]Shit.
[124:01.32]I'm down.
[124:02.70]Okay.
[124:03.16]Sucks to be you.
[124:04.56]Oh, I'll get you.
[124:05.83]Rick.
[124:07.78]Nice, nice.
[124:09.56]Thank you.
[124:13.00]I will say the animation is very nice.
[124:14.98]It's beautiful.
[124:15.39]No, I'm down.
[124:16.27]Criken, get me.
[124:17.83]Well, I got bad news.
[124:18.77]Criken, you got to get me.
[124:19.59]Criken.
[124:21.63]No, wrong person.
[124:22.35]Wrong person.
[124:23.27]I'm just getting somebody.
[124:24.47]Ring.
[124:25.51]Ring.
[124:26.81]Oh, no, no, no.
[124:27.82]Wow, that's karma drama for getting him.
[124:29.56]Ring.
[124:30.06]Oh.
[124:32.88]I got it.
[124:33.32]I got it.
[124:33.78]I got it.
[124:34.16]I messed up.
[124:35.28]This is going to be rough.
[124:36.08]Okay.
[124:36.64]Okay.
[124:37.21]Oh, I can't even revive you.
[124:38.51]I don't think I have enough like revive juice.
[124:41.25]Oh, I took that in the face.
[124:45.76]Dude, what the hell?
[124:50.44]Stop getting hit by things that hurts me.
[124:54.63]Rings alright, I think we're far enough away.
[124:56.35]The rings not gonna reach us.
[124:58.09]OK, he's up.
[125:00.27]I think that still hit me.
[125:01.79]Alright, you got it good.
[125:03.31]I'm down.
[125:04.94]Wait, I think I have one revive.
[125:07.33]No, I don't.
[125:08.81]Shit.
[125:10.69]Alright, let's stay alive.
[125:11.48]I'm distracted.
[125:16.30]No fucking way.
[125:19.77]Oh, guys, this is looking rough.
[125:21.73]Oh, no.
[125:24.01]Oh, how?
[125:27.28]Do we need to go upgrade and come back?
[125:29.20]What do you think?
[125:29.58]Dude, we got to get some fucking DPS on this guy.
[125:32.44]I mean, I think if we just knew the mechanics.
[125:36.09]It's not over.
[125:37.52]We didn't dodge like the first 10 rings.
[125:48.34]I thought it was far enough away.
[125:50.94]I thought it was far enough away.
[125:52.50]Alright, Gorpette.
[125:56.77]Let me solo him.
[125:59.29]Damn.
[126:01.86]If we should get the thing that Poke got with the more more potions.
[126:08.06]I think I haven't upgraded my skills in a while.
[126:10.05]No, we got that for sure.
[126:12.21]We don't need anything else.
[126:14.25]We just gotta lock in.
[126:16.51]We've got new items anyway.
[126:17.41]That's nice.
[126:22.00]We still get to level up too.
[126:22.96]That's good.
[126:25.74]Alright, so no Belfry.
[126:26.77]Stay on map.
[126:28.45]How do you just stay on the map?
[126:30.99]You hold B instead of X. Oh, okay.
[126:34.17]My pet peeve is like emotes that replace words like the.
[126:38.02]Oh, yeah.
[126:39.04]Yeah, I don't like that.
[126:41.66]Sorry about that, man.
[126:43.91]Hope that turns around for you soon.
[126:46.29]They just get like a tier three chest.
[126:48.98]Oh, nice.
[126:55.37]Thank you.
[126:57.61]My chat has one.
[126:59.57]Everyone hates it.
[127:01.42]If you type 100, it does the, you know, 100 emoji.
[127:04.80]That's a ton of HP.
[127:06.11]Holy crap.
[127:07.19]That's not bad.
[127:09.29]It's not so bad.
[127:11.64]At least it is what it says, you know?
[127:13.98]It says 100.
[127:15.62]Yeah.
[127:18.65]You know, yeah.
[127:22.96]Alright, uh, I'm gonna equip a new skill, then I'm good.
[127:27.06]Oh, I've got the clam!
[127:28.30]I wanna get more, uh, health, uh, drinks.

[127:31.75]Down here, right?
[127:32.59]Here it is.
[127:35.39]Okay.
[127:35.89]Damn, I wish I could get this to Ster.
[127:38.61]I have good glo- I have good weapons for Ster.
[127:43.38]I got a tier 3 chest piece and it just gave me almost 200 health.
[127:46.16]That's massive.

[128:42.00]Let's do this.
[128:43.88]I'm almost ready.
[128:44.75]I like all the boss.
[128:45.77]It's cool.
[128:46.11]There's a lot of little bosses to do and stuff.
[128:50.76]I'm at 326 eye level now.
[128:53.20]What am I at?
[128:53.76]I'm not messing around.
[128:54.76]I gotta disenchant all my stuff I don't use.
[128:57.10]I'm at 317.
[128:59.16]You guys are gearing up.
[129:02.49]I just put it on the chest.
[129:03.23]I just got a great chest.
[129:04.89]We got this.
[129:09.85]I'm mega gearing up.
[129:10.93]I'm changing my whole strategy.
[129:12.64]There's no belief.
[129:16.84]Person's out there.
[129:23.19]alright you ready one two three four oh my god five hey everyone in chat can you count uh-oh
[129:58.37]I'm going to start it, Poke.
[130:00.08]It's a Dracula 3 main character.
[130:02.44]It's true.
[130:06.37]Do it again.
[130:06.83]It bugged.
[130:09.27]This is the one.
[130:10.75]Alright.
[130:16.36]Alright.
[130:19.56]Don't use any flasks.
[130:24.81]I look cool now, though.
[130:33.05]You always look cool, man.
[130:34.39]Look at me.
[130:36.92]Oh, yeah.
[130:37.30]I was going to wear that cape.
[130:41.95]Good start.
[130:45.47]Yeah.
[130:45.83]Don't combo them when they're underground.
[130:47.15]One punch.
[130:48.49]One hit.
[130:49.32]I guess you guys don't have punches.
[130:50.48]You guys don't understand my lingo.
[130:52.84]Sorry.
[130:55.79]You see that in daggers for us?
[130:57.27]Good move.
[130:57.77]One slice.
[131:00.89]Now you got me thinking.
[131:02.09]Wait, pizza?
[131:02.60]Where?
[131:04.83]Oh, that sounds... Don't.
[131:06.93]Don't do that.
[131:07.59]Did you say pizza?
[131:10.18]Oh, man.
[131:11.08]Oh, no.
[131:11.89]What kind of pizza, though?
[131:13.09]That's the thing.
[131:14.45]Oh, man.
[131:14.71]Just a good old pepperoni, like, just... Rounded cups.
[131:20.25]Ooh, everybody say your favorite.
[131:22.03]Counting cups.
[131:22.33]Okay, say your favorite pizza on the count of three.
[131:24.66]Your favorite, like, we're talking, like, pan pizza, thin crust.
[131:28.42]You know, talking about, like, the types of pizza.
[131:30.26]Ready?
[131:30.81]Like, okay.
[131:31.93]Alright, we'll start with you, Criken.
[131:34.25]The way I wanted to do it was dumb.
[131:37.91]Can't we just all scream?
[131:40.57]No, it wasn't dumb.
[131:41.49]I was looking forward to it.
[131:42.81]Alright, we'll still do it.
[131:43.87]Ready?
[131:44.55]3, 2, 1.
[131:47.64]Thin crust!
[131:48.50]Normal New York pizza.
[131:51.00]You guys didn't get the assignment right.
[131:53.67]It was kind of vague what type of pizza.
[131:57.13]Your answer was normal pizza?
[132:01.02]I said normal New York style pizza.
[132:03.32]Okay, New York style would be thin crust.
[132:05.85]Okay, sorry.
[132:06.55]I didn't know there was a...
[132:08.90]Specific term for it.
[132:14.09]Normal pizza.
[132:15.89]I feel like all pizza could be good.
[132:18.38]No, I don't like deep dish.
[132:21.74]There's a place here called Jets Pizza.
[132:24.54]Jets Pizza.
[132:25.40]That's a good place.
[132:28.83]I don't know if I tried authentic deep dish where it's like, is it like sauce in the middle instead of bread?
[132:33.80]Yeah, deep dish pizza is kind of, it's like a Chicago pie.
[132:38.38]it's like a big imagine a big cherry pie but instead of the pie on top that's why that's that you guys continue comboing them after it delivered instructions otherwise like that one hit hit one punch nice so if you keep hitting them what happens they keep getting hit stunned and then it looks like you're killing them but yeah they're already gone though I always thought deep dish pizza was just kind of a lasagna with crust on it
[133:05.10]Yeah, it basically is.
[133:06.06]That's why I don't like it.
[133:07.16]Deep dish is... Come on, man.
[133:10.71]It's a pie.
[133:12.23]Yeah, it's a pie.
[133:13.17]But Sicilian pizza is pizza.
[133:16.50]I do like Detroit style pizza, though.
[133:20.02]How do they do it in Detroit?
[133:21.01]It's like squares.
[133:22.21]It's kind of puffy and crispy, though.
[133:24.75]It's not the Sicilian style square.
[133:26.36]It's a little thicker.
[133:36.53]I've got infinite punch now.
[133:41.12]Is that any move?
[133:42.44]Yeah.
[133:42.88]I finished my light combo and I can punch them forever.
[133:48.06]Well, you're going to have to use that on the boss.
[133:50.83]Oh, I hate when they put the sauce on top the cheese.
[133:53.99]Like, what are you doing?
[133:56.59]Oh, trying to reinvent the wheel.
[133:58.41]You think you're so cool?
[133:59.80]Have any of you guys had New Haven pizza?
[134:01.72]New Haven style pizza?
[134:03.72]I don't know what that is either.
[134:04.80]No, no.
[134:05.26]The best pizza in the whole world, by the way.
[134:09.22]It is a thin... If you like that New York-style pizza, New Haven, Connecticut is the place where this really kind of... I don't want to... The word is invented it, but there's like three places in New Haven, Connecticut that just kind of make it.
[134:25.59]It's a really thin, really crispy... It's...
[134:29.89]It's a weird style.
[134:31.01]The slices are kind of long.
[134:32.72]It's long, skinny slices.
[134:34.60]Long pizza.
[134:35.36]Yeah.
[134:35.54]If you look up, there's Sally's and there's Frank Pepe's.
[134:40.17]Both of those places, I'd say, are S tier.
[134:42.52]Alright.
[134:43.04]I'm going to head Frank Pepe's before.
[134:44.46]I got to go get on a plane to Connecticut.
[134:46.55]Head that with Vinny.
[134:48.67]It's very good.
[134:52.96]I actually think I think Sally's is better than Frank Pepe's, which is depends on who you ask.
[134:59.59]That's could be a little sacrilege, but.
[135:08.05]There's one place called Dominos.
[135:14.31]In Canada, we have pizza pizza.
[135:18.91]I've had a pizza pizza.
[135:20.49]That was my local one when I was growing up.
[135:23.44]Wait, you're from Canada?
[135:25.00]No, but they had them in the East Coast, at least in Pennsylvania.
[135:29.19]Is it one of the peace sign?
[135:30.55]I don't know.
[135:33.53]It's just pizza pizza.
[135:35.09]Okay.
[135:36.47]God, now I want a pizza.
[135:37.96]That's just the name of the food twice.
[135:40.51]Yeah, and then there's also two for one.
[135:42.26]Oh, it's peace.
[135:43.40]Peace, a pizza.
[135:43.72]Oh.
[135:44.30]Peace to the world.
[135:45.60]Is that what it was for you?
[135:46.74]That was one for me.
[135:48.28]No, no, it was pizza, pizza.
[135:50.30]Oh, okay.
[135:51.31]I never had a pizza, pizza.
[135:55.09]And then there's two for one pizza.
[135:58.95]Also, Stoic Games.
[136:00.62]Shouts out.
[136:01.44]And also Stoic Games pizza.
[136:03.44]Thank you, Stoic Games.
[136:05.60]There's somebody in that Stoic Games office that makes a mean pizza.
[136:09.14]You know what I mean?
[136:09.62]There has to be.
[136:12.91]That's a hunch.
[136:14.94]You think they're all pointing at him right now?
[136:17.20]It should be.
[136:17.88]Oh, there it is.
[136:19.60]It's him.
[136:22.83]Calm down, guys.
[136:25.53]They're all, like, cheering him on.
[136:28.87]I'm hungry.
[136:30.94]Who did this?
[136:35.74]Bomb.
[136:46.09]No, I took damage.
[136:48.11]I'm giving him the clap.
[136:52.06]Does your character go thunder like boom with his fist together?
[136:56.20]Big boom.
[136:57.38]I didn't want to even take one potion, but I did.
[137:02.01]I just wasted my special.
[137:04.77]I took way too much.
[137:05.53]I am having an issue here.
[137:10.21]I already drank potions.
[137:11.38]I already drank one as well.
[137:14.18]I think we get a refill.
[137:15.71]I don't think we do.
[137:16.41]At least one refill, yeah.
[137:18.25]I think it's only one repotion, though.
[137:19.57]I don't think it's a full refill.
[137:20.86]You should wear some HP regeneration gear and just run around.
[137:25.66]It's actually kind of true.
[137:32.56]Okay.
[137:32.74]I think we're doing better than last time, though.
[137:35.82]Alright, here's the potion.
[137:38.21]We're going to be doing so much better.
[137:40.56]I thought that was only one.
[137:42.95]I thought that was a full refill.
[137:45.21]We know the circles.
[137:46.77]He's dead.
[137:48.71]He's gonna do it right away.
[137:50.39]Yep.
[137:51.52]And we waste our cooldowns when he's stunned.
[137:59.80]And you gotta get the guys before they come up.
[138:01.65]One punch.
[138:02.85]Yep.
[138:03.89]Oh my god, the Ster technique?
[138:08.05]I read the tutorial.
[138:12.39]oh it's alright oh I thought it was someone else oh that was a delayed hit you can just be you man we like you for you circle circle
[138:44.30]Oh, watch out.
[138:46.26]Ah, I was focusing on the beak.
[138:49.87]Stunned.
[138:50.69]Stunned.
[139:05.93]Poison.
[139:06.59]Stacked.
[139:07.35]Up the heads.
[139:08.11]Circles.
[139:10.76]I tried to dash through it.
[139:11.56]Circles again.
[139:13.83]Keep it up.
[139:19.20]Oh, he was off my screen.
[139:20.14]I couldn't see he was doing it.
[139:24.59]Oh.
[139:28.19]No.
[139:33.08]We have so many stacks of poison on him.
[139:34.48]Yeah, 13 sets of poison circles.
[139:51.60]I'm trying to rock break.
[139:54.50]No.
[139:55.31]This is phase two.
[139:58.90]Phase two.
[140:04.09]Watch out.
[140:04.55]Once we get him to zero HP, he's going to pull a sword out of his mouth.
[140:08.70]Don't say that in white.
[140:22.16]Stunned.
[140:22.84]Good.
[140:23.36]Poison stack.
[140:29.87]Yes.
[140:34.03]So much damage.
[140:37.20]Nicely done.
[140:37.62]Nicely done.
[140:38.04]Alright, circles.
[140:43.37]Sir, you're insane, by the way, for killing those mobs.
[140:45.37]I see you.
[140:45.99]Yeah, I did.
[140:46.79]Oh, stun, stun, stun.
[140:47.27]Nicely done.
[140:51.08]I think, uh... Does poison stay on him forever?
[140:55.67]It does not.
[140:56.19]It has a... I mean, like, does it stack infinitely?
[140:59.67]It looks like it went to 20 right there.
[141:01.90]That was a lot.
[141:03.64]I'm getting the, like, infinite super punch combo now, and I have the poison.
[141:08.75]Oh, me too.
[141:09.25]Yeah.
[141:12.45]Kind of going crazy.
[141:15.09]Oh, we got this.
[141:15.75]We got this, guys.
[141:16.50]Oh, my God.
[141:18.26]We're going to kill Panjoy Jira.
[141:21.78]Yeah!
[141:22.40]We did it!
[141:22.62]We killed Bingojira!
[141:24.58]Pangea down.
[141:26.30]Don't let him die.
[141:27.83]Keep him juggled.
[141:28.31]I didn't heal once.
[141:29.95]I didn't heal once.
[141:30.83]You're right.
[141:31.85]What a character arc for you.
[141:33.37]Yes.
[141:34.36]It was the cloak.
[141:35.86]It was the cloak.
[141:39.42]That cloak is pretty cool.
[141:42.89]Whoa.
[141:43.13]Hard-scale daggers.
[141:46.09]I got the fists and they just look like sea cucumbers.
[141:51.19]Hell yeah.
[141:52.33]I want to see those daggers.
[141:56.50]Very cool.
[141:59.30]Damn, 40k damage.
[142:02.26]We were all about even there, you know?
[142:04.64]Really?
[142:05.28]Oh, hell yeah.
[142:06.91]I took way too much damage, but I did a lot.
[142:09.55]Oh, crash!
[142:10.77]Oh my god, the game crashed.
[142:12.15]Oh no.
[142:14.23]Go to the belfry quick.
[142:19.54]You were too powerful.
[142:22.49]That was honestly such an impressive show of teamwork.
[142:25.62]We freaking studied the fight.
[142:28.20]We knew exactly what we needed to improve on.
[142:30.16]The callouts were flawless.
[142:32.28]The Ster method of killing those little guys when they're still in their incubation period.
[142:37.93]That was great.
[142:38.43]Beautiful.
[142:38.91]That was a great team work.
[142:40.87]They're manholes.
[142:43.24]Movie.
[142:45.12]Movie.
[142:47.66]Oh, you make music for those.
[142:51.05]Go back to craft dinner and get your reward.
[142:54.81]Where is he?
[142:56.51]He's not even on my screen.
[142:58.20]Right side.
[143:05.23]Oh, there he is.
[143:06.21]Oh.
[143:09.99]Oh.
[143:12.96]Oh.
[143:14.68]Wait, can you take off?
[143:19.01]Where's craft dinner?
[143:19.65]Oh, there he is.
[143:22.60]I want to see what I got.
[143:23.34]I got a lot of good stuff.
[143:30.19]Dude, craft dinner didn't give us much good stuff.
[143:41.34]Dude, that's a perfect roll on the strike damage, dude.
[143:45.26]Rare.
[143:47.08]Dude, that was rare.
[143:50.43]Am I missing something or do you have to walk back to the belfry?
[143:54.16]Yeah, you can teleport from the from the quest.
[143:57.00]I figured.
[143:58.76]Oh yeah, at the end mission.
[143:59.85]Yeah, so many skills.
[144:13.02]Yeah, there's a lot of things to choose from here.
[144:15.00]Oh, I want that 100%.
[144:30.86]I like that.
[144:36.85]That's cool.
[144:38.39]Oh.
[144:40.27]Yeah.
[144:42.57]Oh, shit.
[144:42.93]I can't.
[144:44.25]Yippee.
[144:45.56]Oh, that's actually insane.
[144:58.21]I'm going to use that.
[145:07.58]Okay.
[145:13.37]Well, awesome.
[145:13.93]That was fun.
[145:16.21]It has been a little over two hours.
[145:18.19]How are you guys doing?
[145:20.21]You guys feeling good?
[145:22.84]Yeah.
[145:23.82]I got to move on to the next thing soon, but this was great.
[145:28.90]I really do like this game.
[145:30.06]I definitely want to get this on my Steam Deck.
[145:31.84]This is a great... Yeah, no, for sure.
[145:33.31]...play in bed sort of game.
[145:36.73]This guy games in bed.
[145:39.47]Can't get enough of anything.
[145:40.91]I'll play this at the store.
[145:42.00]I sleep in bed.
[145:43.78]But yeah, it was a great time.
[145:44.58]It was good playing with you guys.
[145:45.66]I'm glad we got to like a big boss.
[145:48.05]You felt like the first real big boss.
[145:50.51]Yeah.
[145:51.52]Mechanics and everything.
[145:52.82]Yeah, I wonder how many more of those are in the game.
[145:54.63]There are feels like this seems like this.
[145:57.11]At least the map seems pretty.
[145:59.11]Significant is like it's pretty.
[146:01.05]I see some pretty high level.
[146:03.36]Like characters running around so.
[146:05.76]Imagine it does go pretty far.
[146:10.87]We're just a lowly eights and nines.
[146:16.89]Well, thank you stoic.
[146:19.99]thank you so much stoic yeah for making this lovely game and having us this is a great time oh yeah if you want to check it out chat uh I think it's still free on steam for a little bit longer they had a a free I'm looking right now four hours I'm wanting a six hours it should be that it's still going to be free to play for a little bit if you wanted to try it it's out on Xbox now um yeah it's fantastic game pass it's fun time
[146:49.68]Game pass.
[146:50.68]Yeah.
[146:51.52]And when it comes out of that period in the next few hours, whatever you do, you do get to... It carries over out of it.
[146:58.87]Not like, oh, everything's deleted after you come out.
[147:01.15]No.
[147:02.27]Whatever you play within the free-to-play area, you get to keep going forward.
[147:08.04]I actually think it's... This is fun.
[147:09.89]I actually just might just keep playing this.
[147:14.37]I actually like the game a lot.
[147:17.44]We saw the first big boss, and now I want to see another big boss.
[147:21.80]Yeah.
[147:22.54]I like my character.
[147:23.24]I like the abilities.
[147:24.06]I feel like I was getting better.
[147:28.11]Once it clicked, my damage tripled.
[147:30.81]It's fun.
[147:31.13]Great.
[147:31.45]I just dismantled everything.
[147:33.13]Got like 600 spirit dust.
[147:34.49]So I think getting higher tier stuff gives you a lot more spirit dust.
[147:37.64]So you're definitely... I think there's a purple dust after this one, too, that I saw in the store.
[147:45.65]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[147:50.02]See you tomorrow?
[147:53.01]No, that was a lot of fun.
[147:54.99]Until next time, guys.
[147:57.08]See you next time.
[147:58.12]Yep.
[147:58.42]Tablespoon boys.

[148:04.57]See you.
[148:05.15]Bye-bye.
[148:17.14]Alright, so I'm gonna take a quick break.
[148:19.62]I'm gonna go pee.
[148:22.65]And there are a few other things I would like to do today.
[148:27.92]Possible.
[148:28.48]We'll see what Ster is up to after this when I come back.
[148:32.04]But I'm gonna go pee.
[148:35.47]I'm gonna get another drink.
[148:38.25]And then there might be some...
[148:41.98]There might be some white knuckle.
[148:43.64]There might be some mystery game.
[148:45.46]I think the mystery game might be interesting.
[148:47.80]Mystery game seems kind of chill.
[148:49.47]Seems like something we're just going to hang out and play and just chill.
[148:51.99]Seems like kind of a weird game.
[148:55.11]We'll see when I come back.
[148:57.58]But again, thank you Stoic.
[148:59.14]Really appreciate it.
[149:01.02]Sponsored for the last couple days doing this.
[149:06.53]Game is there.
[149:07.37]Towerborn.
[149:11.12]You want to check it out?
[149:11.76]Go for it.
[149:13.77]Seems like they're adding a lot of stuff, so... I mean, we say... That's funny we say that.
[149:18.91]The second day of the sponsor, they added this loot grab.
[149:23.82]So, seems like they're adding things.
[149:27.64]Very cool.
[149:29.23]See you guys in a few minutes.
[149:34.99]We'll figure out what we're doing.
[149:44.57]Uh, pre-rolls are on right now.
[149:46.96]Should I just turn them off?
[149:50.09]Yeah, I'll turn them off.
[149:51.38]We'll get them off now.
[149:54.91]I'll be back.
[150:44.59]Hey, just kidding.
[150:45.15]I didn't leave yet.
[150:48.66]I'm going to very soon.
[150:51.58]Because I've remembered I wanted to do this before I exited the game.
[151:02.34]I have to go back to the request board.
[151:04.92]I have to turn these in.
[151:09.25]Where's the request board?
[151:11.39]That's the map.
[151:14.12]Down here?
[151:16.25]Hey, is the mystery game a dating sim?
[151:18.27]No, it's not.
[151:20.99]I'll just tell you what the mystery game is.
[151:22.93]What if people don't want to stick around for the mystery game, right?
[151:26.24]And wait around for a mystery game?
[151:28.16]The mystery game... Is going to be... The game is called... Dream Corps.
[151:42.48]Dream Corps.
[151:44.57]Looks like a weird little fun kind of exploration kind of creepy kind of game.
[151:51.48]Seems really fun.
[151:54.23]Alright, where is that board?
[151:57.76]Alright, uh, there it is.
[151:58.84]Alright.
[152:02.01]Turn these in.
[152:04.87]Array.
[152:05.79]Money.
[152:07.20]Array.
