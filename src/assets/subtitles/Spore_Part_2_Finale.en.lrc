[00:01.69]Right on time.
[00:02.19]That's right.
[00:04.99]You guys bet on this one?
[00:07.11]Okay.
[00:08.95]So.
[00:10.75]The reason I've tried to be very, very on time today.
[00:15.88]Because I don't know.
[00:16.68]I thought people were betting on this.
[00:19.52]I freaked out like two, three minutes ago.
[00:21.36]I was brushing my teeth.
[00:23.64]I'm just like, oh, fuck.
[00:25.50]What are they betting on this?
[00:27.04]And I like.
[00:27.88]Oh, shit.
[00:29.00]And I like sprinted.
[00:31.13]I got in here as fast as I could.
[00:32.19]I turned it on.
[00:33.83]What if people have channel points on this?
[00:36.15]I don't know.
[00:40.09]I guess not.
[00:40.43]You know what's like funny?
[00:45.39]When I think that people are betting fake currency on something and like gambling.
[00:49.45]I'm incredibly interested and I'm going to be right on time.
[00:54.42]It's interesting.
[00:59.22]You have like a dirty teeth.
[01:02.52]I like to brush my teeth before every stream.
[01:06.31]I have a nice, like, clean, fresh mouth.
[01:10.19]I hate the fact of having a dirty mouth.
[01:15.41]When I'm sitting down talking, I hate that feeling.
[01:18.58]I can feel all individual every tooth.
[01:21.58]There's just, like, slime on it.
[01:22.98]And I can, like, my breath is heavy and dense.
[01:27.50]Ugh.
[01:28.30]I hate it.
[01:30.91]Especially when you're talking, you can, like, you can feel that heavy air.
[01:36.05]Blah.
[01:36.93]Get rid of it.
[01:37.65]I hate it.
[01:40.69]Brush your teeth on stream.
[01:41.65]I just did.
[01:42.33]Alright, give me a sec.
[01:43.01]Be right back.
[01:43.89]Gonna tweet this.
[02:17.64]Did I get that right?
[02:18.24]Okay.
[02:20.02]I don't know why, but for some reason I thought I spelled my Twitch channel wrong.
[02:25.57]Where are my headphones?
[02:27.12]Fuck.
[02:27.50]Hold on.
[02:27.84]I'll be right back.
[03:06.49]Alright, I got him.
[03:07.93]So today we are going to play.
[03:11.25]Probably the remainder of what we're going to do in Spore.
[03:15.61]Can I hear anything?
[03:18.27]Let me see.
[03:18.61]Can't hear anything.
[03:22.11]There we go.
[03:25.77]Alright, now I can hear you.
[03:26.47]You're not even talking.
[03:29.35]Oh, now I can hear you.
[03:32.62]Yeah, we can play Spore.
[03:35.31]What is this title, bro?
[03:39.67]That's Jeremiah 420.
[03:43.21]I don't know.
[03:43.67]We were in pre-stream and somebody thought it was a good idea.
[03:46.01]It makes sense.
[03:48.97]I guess it's perfect for today.
[03:52.97]You're muted?
[03:53.51]Do a tooth cam.
[03:59.17]No, I'm not putting a cam.
[04:00.70]Look.
[04:02.76]I am not putting my teeth in the camera.
[04:06.34]I'm not putting my, like, nose in the camera.
[04:11.15]I'm not going to, like, put my feet in the camera.
[04:13.51]I'm not going to, like, show you my elbows.
[04:15.13]No, I'm not.
[04:15.55]I'm going to fucking statue in this seat.
[04:18.07]I'm not doing any of that.
[04:21.37]I'm not going to, like, oh, dude, open your mouth and show us, like, all of your teeth.
[04:24.56]Go like this and pull your cheeks out and go, ah.
[04:27.80]It would be wicked funny.
[04:29.54]Just do it.
[04:30.60]I'm not doing that.
[04:37.25]Anytime somebody tells you something, something, something, dash, it'll be wicked funny.
[04:41.66]I don't know if I trust that person.
[04:46.02]I don't trust that.
[04:52.04]It'll be wicked funny.
[04:53.90]Why do you want me to do that so bad?
[04:54.94]You think that you're kind of bouncing off of me.
[04:58.26]Thinking that I'll think what you just said is funny because it's a pretty odd request.
[05:02.42]So therefore, it might be funny.
[05:03.52]I might think it's funny.
[05:05.52]But you don't think it's funny.
[05:09.12]I think I get you.
[05:10.80]I think I understand you.
[05:16.94]Play Spore.
[05:17.64]It'll be wicked funny.
[05:18.54]Play the game.
[05:24.44]It'll be wicked funny.
[05:25.44]Shit.
[05:31.67]He has wooden teeth.
[05:32.67]That's why.
[05:33.29]Federal Reserve bailed you out.
[05:35.53]No, they didn't.
[05:38.15]No more.
[05:38.61]What are you talking about?
[05:41.09]Alright, let's go.
[05:41.71]Dude, you should totally, like, eat a bunch of grapes and, like, food with your hands.
[05:49.69]And, like, eat a bunch of apples with your hands and get, like, bacon and hands and bacon grease all over your mouth and stuff.
[05:53.96]It'd be wicked funny.
[05:55.96]Oh.
[06:01.66]I gotta watch out now.
[06:02.54]I gotta watch out for the it'll be wicked funny people.
[06:04.62]I have to watch out for that now.
[06:07.99]Here we go.
[06:08.45]Camera's not on, right?
[06:09.35]Good.
[06:13.21]Hey, is, like, showing your desktop accidentally?
[06:16.54]Like, the I'm naked?
[06:17.76]The webcam just turned on accidentally of, like, being on a computer?
[06:21.56]It kind of is, isn't it?
[06:29.82]Yes, it is.
[06:33.78]Alright, here we are.
[06:35.45]On the planet, uh, Zircon, uh, Zircan.
[06:39.95]Like, I'm so glad this doesn't pop up very often.
[06:42.27]Like, I don't care about this.
[06:43.39]Like, it's just, it's so... Default wallpaper Andy.
[06:49.06]We went over this yesterday.
[06:52.68]Oh, by the way, you notice how, like, I've dragged everything off?
[06:55.80]It's just a background?
[06:59.15]Every time I know I'm going to capture my desktop, it's like, well, click, drag, over to the other monitor.
[07:04.63]He won't want you to see any of that shit.
[07:08.29]Oh, guys, I have to take a clean desktop.
[07:10.16]I don't have anything.
[07:10.84]I don't even use a computer.
[07:12.76]It's just desktop wallpaper.
[07:14.58]I don't have anything on my desktop.
[07:16.54]I don't even use computers.
[07:19.26]You do the same fucking thing.
[07:20.56]You do the same thing.
[07:21.34]You do the same exact thing.
[07:25.05]If you know someone's coming over...
[07:27.28]And then, oh, hey, dude, by the way, can I use your computer?
[07:32.95]Okay, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[07:39.67]Yeah, um, no, no, you can't, but why, why couldn't you?
[07:43.70]Hey, dude, I'm gonna be, like, in town for a little while.
[07:45.48]I'm not gonna have access to my computer.
[07:49.26]Can I use yours?
[07:52.32]Oh, my fucking god, it's, like, panic.
[07:55.33]And for no reason, too.
[07:56.75]Like, there's... I don't, like... There's nothing on this computer that's, like, bad.
[08:02.40]It's just, like, I don't know.
[08:03.12]It feels weird.
[08:03.68]It feels like somebody's, like, sitting in your skin.
[08:05.36]Doesn't it?
[08:06.54]It feels like somebody's, like, sitting in your body.
[08:08.14]Like, in, like... It is your bones.
[08:09.54]Like, controlling your hands and stuff.
[08:11.53]It feels weird.
[08:14.83]It kind of feels the same way if somebody was like, oh, hey, here, take the keys to my house and just go in and do whatever the fuck you want.
[08:21.13]Hey, go in the fridge.
[08:22.97]Go, like, just go into the pantry.
[08:24.79]Sleep in the bed, too.
[08:25.67]Like, here's the keys to my house.
[08:26.69]I'm going to be gone for a week.
[08:27.89]It feels the same way.
[08:30.42]Even though there's nothing bad in my house or anything.
[08:36.76]Quick, take everything out of the fridge.
[08:37.92]But I don't know.
[08:38.60]It's just weird.
[08:45.56]It's a Zorn.
[08:46.32]It's Zorn.
[08:47.20]No.
[08:50.41]It's not Zorn related.
[08:51.85]Okay, here we go.
[08:58.05]We're at the tribe of those of you that missed yesterday's stream.
[09:00.43]Here are the germamites.
[09:01.33]I thought he just lit on fire.
[09:06.12]Already designed very... I don't know why I made them that like green teal color.
[09:11.40]Alright.
[09:13.40]Gather fruit, meat, or fish.
[09:16.49]We're going to go over here.
[09:19.01]What do I want to do?
[09:22.54]Let's get fruit.
[09:23.74]Everybody go over here and get some fruit.
[09:30.68]Team Fortress 2.
[09:34.64]Gather food, you dummy.
[09:35.74]I just sent him over there.
[09:39.54]Oh, here's our friends that we made that apparently didn't get smarter.
[09:43.62]This is kind of sad, don't you think?
[09:48.14]Like, rank?
[09:49.72]And the rat?
[09:50.24]Like, we evolved, but they didn't?
[09:52.26]That's kind of sad.
[09:53.96]So they're just dumb, and we're smart.
[09:58.46]Alright, I got food.
[10:01.97]Click on your hut and add a baby.
[10:03.67]These guys are freaking me out.
[10:06.89]Add a baby is ten food.
[10:08.19]Alright, so should we get... Should we eat people?
[10:15.32]What do you guys think?
[10:18.47]Should we eat people?
[10:21.12]I think it's very scary looking.
[10:23.84]Alright, let's get another baby.
[10:30.88]Should we eat people?
[10:32.90]Click on the hat icon to open the tribe member panel.
[10:36.31]You know what?
[10:36.63]Here's the thing about Spore.
[10:37.53]I think a lot of you can relate to this.
[10:40.51]Most of you, I think, can relate to this.
[10:43.53]I got to this part of Spore and said, this game's stupid.
[10:47.31]And stopped playing.
[10:51.62]You got, everyone did that, I think, right?
[10:53.74]Everybody does the cell stage, makes the creatures, and has the fun, putting, like, the, extending the nose, and making the head big, and making a big fat belly, and, and walking around and dancing, and then when you get to this part, you just uninstall the game, because it's like, oh, I'm done, this was stupid.
[11:08.45]This stage.
[11:09.11]Like, and forward.
[11:10.33]So this is all brand new to me, I never played this stuff, ever.
[11:12.97]I really didn't.
[11:15.87]I did, I didn't even care.
[11:17.01]I just like, oh, I was, dude, I'm done, like, extending the funny animal's nose, I'm done.
[11:21.96]Let's go.
[11:25.04]Face is the worst one.
[11:26.00]Hmm.
[11:27.54]Well, we'll see.
[11:28.84]Alright, click on the hat icon to open the tribe member panel.
[11:31.68]Roll over your tribe member, then click the edit outfit.
[11:33.82]I already did this.
[11:41.06]Yeah, didn't I already do this?
[11:43.38]Yeah, I already did this.
[11:44.47]I did this already.
[11:50.05]Uninstall it now.
[11:52.47]Yeah, we're good to go.
[11:54.19]Instruments.
[11:55.89]Wooden... Wait, okay.
[11:57.53]I need to collect wood?
[12:02.31]Is that three to six?
[12:03.88]Oh, I can have up to six people here.
[12:05.16]Alright.
[12:06.48]Should I send somebody over here?
[12:07.56]As like an envoy?
[12:09.50]Alright, I'm going to send somebody over as an envoy.
[12:17.82]Over here.
[12:21.62]Wait, I don't want to attack.
[12:24.60]We give them food?
[12:25.26]Alright, I'm going to bring them plates of food.
[12:29.14]Who are these people?
[12:41.20]A rival tribe of Traitan have formed on your planet.
[12:45.44]Hmm.
[12:50.33]The tribal chieftain leads your tribe.
[12:52.32]Your tribe can go into combat without its chief.
[12:55.76]Oh, it can go into combat without the chief.
[12:58.28]But the chief isn't necessary for any social encounters with other tribes.
[13:01.54]Sure.
[13:02.52]The chieftain also invokes any of your tribe's consequence abilities.
[13:05.89]To use a consequence ability, first select your chieftain, and then click on the ability you'd like to use.
[13:11.43]Well, I want to, like, make friends with these guys.
[13:12.79]You need at least 15 food to feed an animal.
[13:16.66]Oh, does he have a dog bone?
[13:22.18]Why can't I be friends with these guys?
[13:26.26]Alright, get 15 food.
[13:27.72]I want to make friends with this tribe.
[13:30.10]Go on.
[13:30.56]Go back to what you were doing.
[13:37.29]What do they eat?
[13:37.77]15 food.
[13:41.83]That's not a tribe.
[13:42.67]These are animals.
[13:43.47]What?
[13:44.89]Baby burger?
[13:46.73]Well, I mean...
[13:50.42]What are you doing over here?
[13:51.72]You better not feed them.
[13:52.86]If you feed them, I'm gonna be so pissed.
[13:56.62]Hey!
[13:59.00]Stop that!
[14:03.01]Kill.
[14:06.87]Kick his ass.
[14:11.55]Yeah.
[14:12.73]And tell him... Don't kill him though.
[14:14.57]Just get a beat him up so he has to run away and tell his friends.
[14:21.06]Eat him.
[14:23.18]Alright, listen, listen up.
[14:25.12]Fergus, I got something for you.
[14:26.72]What do you think about this?
[14:29.68]It's food.
[14:32.88]You like it?
[14:33.28]Give it a try.
[14:37.33]Give it a try.
[14:45.51]You like food?
[14:50.87]Beastmaster?
[14:51.53]Flying fish?
[14:52.23]What the hell does that mean?
[14:53.89]He's a vegetarian.
[14:54.69]I just gave him fruits.
[14:55.63]Oh, there he goes!
[14:59.21]He liked it!
[15:01.87]You have too many domesticated animals at this time.
[15:09.86]What the fuck is happening?
[15:12.98]What are we doing?
[15:14.40]What am I doing to him?
[15:18.42]Am I stealing this guy?
[15:23.75]Wait, I'm... It's a... It's a man on the moon.
[15:45.16]Annie Kaufman.
[15:47.46]Oh, they're waving.
[15:48.00]Okay, at least they're friends.
[15:48.82]I have like a group of animal friends.
[15:57.05]You try to domesticate them, but you have too many.
[15:59.49]So wait, so I still have a domesticated Gronk.
[16:02.73]Bring gifts to the brown village.
[16:04.15]Where?
[16:04.39]Huh?
[16:07.49]They're pissed off.
[16:09.67]I haven't even had... Hold on, let me make some more babies.
[16:15.14]Bring gifts to the... Okay, wait.
[16:19.12]Not these guys.
[16:20.78]Wait, it is these guys.
[16:22.36]I killed somebody here.
[16:27.58]are they doing alright do they want what if I gave him fruits alright let's go here what are they holding kill their entire tribe well they're very close I don't want to wait are they bringing food too oh this is gonna be awkward this is this is when you order like uber eats from three different places because you want like a sampling of three different places that day
[16:55.93]Like three Uber Eats drivers show up at the same time.
[16:59.55]I promise it's not a prank.
[17:00.85]I just wanted to sample three different foods.
[17:03.49]Are we friends?
[17:19.45]Who does that?
[17:20.09]I don't.
[17:20.99]I'm making it up.
[17:27.92]I don't do that.
[17:31.46]I did not order from three different places to have a sampling of three different foods.
[17:40.19]I think 85% of every Uber Eats order I've ever done was McDonald's.
[17:48.06]And I'm 90% sure that that's accurate.
[17:58.03]That's disgusting.
[18:00.39]Why is that disgusting?
[18:05.59]That's way too specific.
[18:06.53]He does that.
[18:08.37]I don't fucking do that.
[18:16.38]Okay.
[18:17.60]Ally the brown village by playing music for them.
[18:21.10]Well, ally tribes will bring your tribe gifts.
[18:23.20]Alright, I need to make a musical instrument house.
[18:27.78]It's only 25 food.
[18:29.00]Alright.
[18:29.60]Collect food.
[18:30.36]Back to getting food.
[18:31.00]All of you.
[18:32.96]Rich streamer eats McDonald's.
[18:35.50]I love McDonald's.
[18:36.74]I love that place.
[18:44.05]I really do.
[18:44.91]I love McDonald's.
[18:45.97]I don't know how many times I have to say that before people think it's true.
[18:50.25]Collect the eggs, you dipshit.
[18:52.85]What eggs?
[18:53.25]Eggs.
[18:58.73]Eggs?
[19:04.65]Nobody's telling me about eggs.
[19:11.10]Take their eggs?
[19:15.62]Next to your domesticated animals.
[19:23.48]What?
[19:24.37]They're laying eggs in here?
[19:36.52]Okay.
[19:36.82]Alright, let me make a musical instrument place.
[19:41.34]Impress neighboring tribes with these horns.
[19:44.49]Mmm, over here.
[19:45.29]This will be the music hut.
[19:52.27]Egg time.
[20:01.03]I do like McDonald's a lot.
[20:02.59]It's like one of my favorite places to eat.
[20:05.22]It really is.
[20:08.92]Is that a pizza?
[20:10.16]He's got like an egg pizza.
[20:11.88]What are you doing with that?
[20:14.70]Wait, do you just have it?
[20:16.12]Where's he going with it?
[20:18.14]Oh, shit.
[20:18.50]Nice.
[20:18.68]Okay.
[20:20.82]I got 44 food.
[20:22.06]What else can I do now?
[20:23.84]Mine is better than McDonald's.
[20:28.32]Right.
[20:28.94]I mean, I don't care though.
[20:31.72]There are a lot of places better than McDonald's, but that doesn't take away from the fact that I eat there all the time.
[20:38.53]Should I make an instrument?
[20:46.19]Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.
[20:47.25]Why not?
[20:47.56]I can't... Why not?
[20:56.70]Weapons.
[20:57.16]Ooh.
[21:01.81]That's the chief.
[21:02.85]Oh, okay.
[21:06.35]Alright, so I got a horn.
[21:08.73]Alright, you get a horn too.
[21:12.05]I'd much rather eat a Burger King Whopper than a stinky Big Mac.
[21:14.75]Yuck.
[21:17.34]That's alright.
[21:20.10]Grab a horn.
[21:20.42]Alright, we're going to go impress the village.
[21:28.92]I need the chief, don't I?
[21:30.85]Chief, come with me.
[21:34.07]Wooden horns.
[21:34.87]You can only use that ability during performance.
[21:36.21]Alright, let's go.
[21:42.90]Who actually eats in at McDonald's?
[21:47.80]Oh, I didn't say I was eating in the restaurant.
[21:52.91]I mean, you can.
[21:53.95]What's wrong with that?
[21:54.63]Alright, here we go.
[22:00.33]It's time to play some music.
[22:07.38]Here we go.
[22:07.88]Oh, they love it.
[22:17.25]You like this?
[22:19.71]They love that.
[22:23.41]We are now friends.
[22:24.29]10 out of 10.
[22:27.75]Hey Ato, what are you doing over there?
[22:34.09]Alright, so now we're friends.
[22:36.67]We need to be allies with them though.
[22:40.13]We keep doing it?
[22:42.77]Maybe we should move people with horns.
[22:47.66]Oh, they want the horns.
[22:48.70]Okay, I see.
[22:49.62]They want horns again.
[22:50.38]They want it again.
[22:54.00]Not enough?
[23:00.10]Oh, I got it.
[23:01.84]Alright, the new tribe is your ally.
[23:08.35]They love it.
[23:12.51]Hmm.
[23:17.19]I like McDonald's.
[23:17.85]I like Burger King.
[23:18.43]I like Wendy's.
[23:20.71]But if I have a choice in the matter, it's McDonald's.
[23:25.41]I don't know.
[23:25.75]I just like their... I know exactly what to order there.
[23:28.79]If I go to Burger King, I don't know what to order.
[23:32.93]And I go, I don't fucking know.
[23:33.99]And I put my glasses on and lean into the menu.
[23:35.73]And I go, what is good here?
[23:38.74]Wendy's, I usually get a Junior Bacon Cheeseburger.
[23:41.56]Problem with that, though.
[23:42.80]I got a problem with that.
[23:43.70]It's always cold.
[23:45.02]I've never, ever experienced a hot Junior Bacon Cheeseburger from Wendy's.
[23:49.26]It is always cold.
[23:50.92]Every single time.
[23:52.36]It's very good.
[23:53.66]It tastes very good, but it's cold every single time I've ever eaten it in 20 fucking years of going there.
[24:01.16]Across states, across the entire nation.
[24:04.75]across all of the United States of America it's like that every time and I don't know why but it's very it tastes very good alright I got some new oh wait what did that say your mouth is too warm
[24:32.80]I just have, like, an extremely hot mouth.
[24:35.92]That's what it is.
[24:38.90]Now, I've had burgers from McDonald's that were cold.
[24:41.58]I've had Big Macs that were just lukewarm in the middle.
[24:44.62]But not every time.
[24:46.58]Your tribe grows in prestige.
[24:47.80]You have a larger hut to show for it, and your tribe can now sustain up to nine tribe members.
[24:54.72]Alright, cool.
[24:55.90]Let's get some more.
[24:57.08]Babies.
[24:58.80]Babies.
[25:00.92]More babies.
[25:07.86]And let's get some food.
[25:14.03]Big Mac or Quarter Pounder?
[25:15.09]I prefer Big Mac.
[25:20.85]Okay, I think I'm good, right?
[25:22.95]Where is everybody?
[25:23.49]Alright, everybody get over here.
[25:26.73]Should we chop down some trees?
[25:30.27]We need more food.
[25:38.66]You have garbage taste.
[25:41.11]Does it really matter though?
[25:41.93]I can really go over this.
[25:46.77]All fast food is gross.
[25:49.07]It just is.
[25:49.49]Does it really matter if you like Burger King or McDonald's more?
[25:53.56]Like they're both gross.
[25:56.88]In their own ways.
[25:59.22]But it's delicious and yummy and quick and usually pretty affordable and it's really easy.
[26:04.98]Does it really matter?
[26:12.26]I honestly, the affordable part, I'm not so sure of anymore.
[26:17.23]I've been to McDonald's a lot of times and the order, like if you got like two, there's like two or three people in the car.
[26:22.35]It's like, okay, we're going to get this.
[26:24.47]We're going to get that.
[26:25.11]Okay.
[26:25.57]And okay.
[26:26.07]That'll be like $28.
[26:27.35]Drive around, please.
[26:28.06]It's like, wait, what?
[26:29.92]How much did we order?
[26:32.22]We order.
[26:32.60]How much did we order?
[26:33.16]That's a lot of food.
[26:34.00]No, it's not.
[26:34.66]Was it?
[26:36.27]And you can go like down the street to a place that's not like a McDonald's.
[26:39.86]And it's like 20 bucks to eat.
[26:44.62]For like two or three people in a car.
[26:46.56]It's like, really?
[26:47.08]What's going on here?
[26:49.42]Like $35 for us to order like a couple of meals?
[26:56.18]It's not four fucking dollars for like 15 items.
[27:01.00]No, but I'm saying, like, there are other restaurants that are not McDonald's that are better than McDonald's where you can get food for cheaper.
[27:12.97]Exist.
[27:15.81]Why is everybody holding eggs?
[27:17.62]Return the eggs!
[27:24.28]Why?
[27:25.12]Put the eggs in here!
[27:30.33]Then why would you get McDonald's?
[27:31.39]Because it takes 10 seconds to get your food.
[27:33.48]Alright, everybody... I need to expand.
[27:38.98]Should I just... Should we get weapons?
[27:52.33]What's that?
[27:54.83]Raiders spotted.
[27:55.53]Another tribe is attacking.
[27:56.56]What?
[28:02.01]Oh shit.
[28:02.17]Oh shit.
[28:02.43]Back back back back back back back back back back back back! Spears spears spears spears! Get him, get him, get him.
[28:06.00]Those are horns, those are horns, those are horns.
[28:09.00]Everybody get a weapon. Everybody get a weapon!
[28:15.00]Alright. Now KILL!
[28:23.00]KILL!
[28:28.00]These guys have so much health.
[28:34.01]Oh, thank you for the raid.
[28:36.76]I appreciate you guys coming from the other stream.
[28:39.66]Hey, welcome.
[28:40.80]Thanks for the raid.
[28:42.56]Now kill them.
[28:54.39]Bronk is helping.
[28:55.23]He really is, yeah.
[28:55.79]Alright, we did it.
[29:00.21]Success.
[29:03.92]Can I upgrade this?
[29:09.38]What happened to the cow?
[29:14.55]The cow's dead.
[29:15.37]Raiders have been spotted.
[29:16.61]They plan to steal your food.
[29:17.83]What?
[29:18.01]What are you talking about?
[29:20.99]It's one guy.
[29:29.56]Are you sure this is not just a guy that was walking around?
[29:31.52]Oh my goodness.
[29:37.33]Did that person get away?
[29:37.99]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[29:41.29]We gotta get back to this.
[29:42.13]I gotta upgrade.
[29:45.85]Bring gifts to this village?
[29:46.83]They just attacked.
[29:47.49]Get that guy some McDonald's.
[29:55.72]What?
[29:57.72]Most psychopathic tribe in history.
[29:59.54]Alright, hold on.
[30:03.10]Let me go to the editor here.
[30:06.84]Alright, maracas and fishing spears.
[30:09.64]Equip tribe members with fishing spears to maximize their fishing bounty.
[30:13.18]Yeah, I'll put that over here.
[30:15.44]And then maracas.
[30:18.78]Right here.
[30:21.38]I got some new tribe stuff, right?
[30:26.63]I did.
[30:26.87]Here we go.
[30:29.27]Ooh, alright.
[30:29.85]I'm getting... Alright, alright, alright.
[30:31.77]I'm gonna get a bunch more food.
[30:32.73]Ten.
[30:34.79]What...
[30:36.73]What do I have for a mask now?
[30:37.57]This?
[30:38.93]This one.
[30:39.71]Social.
[30:40.35]Oh, get that social shit out of here.
[30:41.87]Don't have enough.
[30:44.91]Fuck.
[30:46.30]Um.
[30:48.88]25 for gathering.
[30:54.82]Yeah, I am going to war.
[30:56.84]It's not immediately.
[30:59.40]I sell the rings.
[31:02.54]And the mustache.
[31:10.76]Alright, there's one more somewhere.
[31:14.04]Oh, let's see.
[31:14.58]Get rid of this.
[31:16.00]Alright, now we're going to put the combat mask on.
[31:26.15]And we're going to go destroy that village.
[31:27.49]Alright.
[31:40.80]Perfect.
[31:43.86]Hey Jeremy, it's me, your best friend.
[31:44.96]McDonald's is going to be very happy with the ad.
[31:50.00]Me, your best friend.
[31:50.92]Hi, thanks, best friend.
[31:51.93]Okay.
[32:02.67]Now I got some combat prowess.
[32:07.59]I don't want to lose everybody, though.
[32:09.76]Let me domesticate an animal.
[32:11.46]These guys already like us a lot.
[32:13.38]I want them to be friends with us.
[32:14.28]Alright, you come here.
[32:17.82]Domesticate a member of the burger species.
[32:21.92]Good.
[32:23.32]Well, I need you.
[32:24.67]Can I send them on missions?
[32:28.31]For you.
[32:34.11]Okay.
[32:38.12]I have a special mission for you.
[32:39.30]I'm going to send you on a great exploration.
[32:43.40]To pick up a rock.
[32:45.11]And throw it as hard as you can.
[32:46.95]Over at somebody's head.
[32:48.41]At the other village.
[32:51.53]And what I want you to do.
[32:52.43]Is I want you to hide behind a bush.
[32:54.65]And when they come out looking.
[32:56.01]To see where the rock came from.
[32:57.53]You point.
[32:59.86]Over there at the other village.
[33:03.96]And say.
[33:05.30]Rock.
[33:07.00]Get ready.
[33:12.34]And then I will come in with food for both.
[33:16.78]And explain how I can't believe that this conflict is continuing.
[33:22.00]Alright.
[33:22.96]Seriously.
[33:25.11]You wanna come in?
[33:25.75]You wanna fuck around?
[33:29.19]Just get him, get him, get him, get him!
[33:31.81]Focus.
[33:32.13]This is what I do in RTSs.
[33:33.35]This is why I lose every single game.
[33:35.57]Um, I just focus every single unit on one person at a time.
[33:39.71]Like this.
[33:40.67]I don't, like, press A, attack, move, and then click over here.
[33:42.95]Nope.
[33:43.25]We kill one person at a time.
[33:44.85]Instantly.
[33:48.60]We just firing squad one person at a time.
[33:54.72]Even if I have, like, a hundred units, I just, like, go like this.
[33:58.70]Ugh!
[34:12.07]You deserve this.
[34:12.71]I'm sorry, but it's true.
[34:15.61]You deserve this.
[34:19.07]Kill the chief.
[34:20.19]He's surrounded by babies.
[34:21.09]Did he just scream?
[34:30.77]Do you see us coming?
[34:31.63]Leave dead.
[34:33.61]Now just wipe out the... I can't even say that out loud.
[34:37.37]Kill the... I can't say it out loud.
[34:41.12]Defeat the enemy babies.
[34:42.62]There you go.
[34:43.70]Now it's family friendly.
[34:44.88]Alright.
[34:55.42]Take it out.
[34:57.52]Claim this village.
[34:59.54]It is ours now.
[35:02.70]What are these things?
[35:04.40]Wait, something's coming to steal my food?
[35:10.48]Oh shit!
[35:13.48]Stop them!
[35:14.54]Stop them, stop them!
[35:15.34]Come on Gronkh!
[35:18.40]Oh no, my birthday pet Berg is about to be killed.
[35:21.52]Come back, come back, come back, come back.
[35:22.54]Everybody come back.
[35:27.55]Quick, quick, quick.
[35:27.97]It's alright.
[35:28.49]They don't get shit right now.
[35:29.35]That's fine.
[35:29.83]That was a good raid.
[35:32.41]Oh, God damn it.
[35:33.23]How do I attack move?
[35:35.65]Brown Village is offering your tribe a gift.
[35:37.53]Click the basket to accept it.
[35:39.17]Um, can Brown Tribe come and help?
[35:47.66]Come on, come on, help me.
[35:48.58]Thank God.
[35:49.22]Fisherman.
[35:51.96]Help us.
[35:56.70]Yes, thank God.
[35:58.35]Reinforcements.
[35:59.83]I'm so glad.
[36:00.71]I'm so glad you TP'd here with two people.
[36:06.31]Red, blue, green, yellow.
[36:08.99]They're all attacking me at the same time.
[36:10.59]And you're going to TP here with two footmen?
[36:13.09]Thanks.
[36:14.02]You're next, by the way.
[36:15.42]Just want to make that clear.
[36:16.72]You're next.
[36:17.66]You're going to die.
[36:18.76]It's over.
[36:19.24]I'm exiting the game.
[36:25.06]I want the gift.
[36:25.56]Take it.
[36:28.53]What is it?
[36:28.87]Press three.
[36:33.13]Three?
[36:33.35]What?
[36:34.89]Ooh, it's a bunch of food.
[36:35.57]Thanks, guys.
[36:36.03]Press three, fat fuck.
[36:40.10]What?
[36:40.64]I'm pressing three.
[36:41.50]Alright, we're safe.
[36:52.89]Back to what we were doing.
[36:58.72]There's three in... Oh, three.
[37:03.42]Don't let them... Don't let them surrender.
[37:05.26]They had that opportunity like fucking three days ago.
[37:12.00]Don't let them surrender.
[37:12.76]Three!
[37:19.38]What just happened?
[37:30.83]Wild animals are coming to steal your food.
[37:32.86]Why?
[37:33.56]Just kill this village already.
[37:34.88]I'm sending one person back.
[37:36.66]You.
[37:37.32]Steven.
[37:37.82]What's his name?
[37:38.62]Spearman.
[37:39.02]Alright, come on.
[37:41.16]Come on, Spearman.
[37:43.78]Is that the wild animal?
[37:46.21]Wait, that's me.
[37:46.97]That's one of my guys.
[37:50.23]What?
[37:54.61]Isn't that one of my people?
[37:58.39]That's a traitor.
[38:04.76]Oh, is that... What?
[38:12.57]You have destroyed the Pink Village.
[38:13.89]Your tribe has carved a second totem piece to remember this momentous occasion.
[38:18.69]It spoils the battle in our tools and outfits.
[38:21.13]Find them in your tribal planner.
[38:23.79]What are you doing here?
[38:35.81]We're gonna eat him?
[38:46.44]Okay.
[38:47.38]Well, I took over the village.
[38:48.54]Let's go.
[38:48.96]I need some... Can I take anything?
[38:51.98]Can I steal anything else?
[38:54.50]Everybody go back.
[38:57.61]An epic gecko.
[39:00.37]That thing's awesome.
[39:02.05]It's like the Geico gecko.
[39:03.83]It's like gecks.
[39:04.75]What?
[39:05.01]What?
[39:06.56]Kill it.
[39:07.12]Kill it.
[39:07.44]Kill it.
[39:07.74]Kill it.
[39:08.03]Kill it.
[39:08.33]Kill it.
[39:08.81]Absolutely kill this thing.
[39:10.95]And then take all of its food.
[39:15.83]God, this is fucking crazy.
[39:23.97]Mate, a funny thing happened.
[39:26.87]When they were trying to talk about what the tagline should have been, me, my crazy old me said, it should be 15% saves you 50% or more.
[39:33.27]Have you seen that commercial?
[39:36.27]Can they stop fucking doing that already?
[39:40.08]Stop doing that.
[39:43.60]Stop doing that commercial.
[39:46.34]They keep doing that commercial.
[39:47.96]They keep doing like the gecko is a real person.
[39:52.90]You guys pick up on that yet?
[39:53.88]They're doing like the Geico gecko is a real guy behind the scenes.
[39:58.56]He's a real person.
[39:59.48]It's not like a lizard actor.
[40:03.74]Why are you doing that?
[40:06.22]They, like, have, like, people chattering in the background, like, pretending there's, like, a set and stuff.
[40:09.42]And he's like, oh, yeah.
[40:10.42]Oh, I can't keep laughing at you, mate.
[40:12.23]You're so funny over there.
[40:13.07]Why are they making him a real person?
[40:16.65]It's weird.
[40:17.23]And that's the whole commercial.
[40:18.11]There's no commercial.
[40:20.93]He just, like, acts, like, kind of, like, ah, candidly behind the scenes, huh?
[40:24.98]They've done, like, three or four of those.
[40:29.50]I don't get it.
[40:33.51]But it's not like behind the scenes.
[40:34.79]This is the actor talking behind the scenes.
[40:36.85]It's the Geico gecko is in front of the camera.
[40:39.95]And we're on set and the gecko is real.
[40:43.91]I don't get it.
[40:47.11]Flying fish?
[40:47.85]What?
[40:54.57]The gecko is real.
[40:55.55]Somebody sit that person down.
[40:59.87]They've got a lot to talk about.
[41:03.10]We've got a lot to tell you.
[41:04.88]I just want to let you know.
[41:05.68]We've got to go over a lot of mascots.
[41:08.42]Alright.
[41:08.64]Equip members with gathering canes to maximize fruit.
[41:13.60]Oh, I want that.
[41:14.44]Healing rods.
[41:17.74]And didgeridoos?
[41:22.66]Gecko is real.
[41:29.76]Wait, I have maracas, right?
[41:31.34]Those are horns, healing rods, throwing... Okay, I need maracas.
[41:35.64]Oh, they destroyed it.
[41:36.84]Right.
[41:38.26]Can I repair it?
[41:42.55]Oh, can we repair that?
[41:45.95]No.
[41:47.19]Cannot repair it.
[41:54.79]Maracas and didgeridoos.
[41:58.51]We need to inform Jerma that he has abilities he can use.
[42:00.69]The shiny blue buttons that he refuses to press.
[42:03.14]Everyone spam this.
[42:04.98]Press the buttons for free food and other things, please.
[42:07.32]The shiny blue buttons, okay?
[42:10.88]Gathering canes.
[42:15.40]Flying fish.
[42:16.58]Free food.
[42:17.47]Blue buttons.
[42:22.85]I pressed the blue button.
[42:23.49]I didn't get any free food.
[42:24.27]Beastmaster.
[42:27.19]Beastmaster.
[42:34.01]I didn't get anything.
[42:42.07]Mandalorian.
[42:47.65]I killed that, I guess.
[42:57.99]Kill that thing.
[42:59.41]We need its food.
[43:00.17]It's got like a gold bar on its back.
[43:03.57]Everybody kill that!
[43:09.01]Kill it!
[43:10.91]Wait, why are we all fucked up?
[43:12.03]What's wrong with us?
[43:18.74]It's your friend.
[43:19.84]No, it's not.
[43:22.82]Is it?
[43:25.28]Why are we all confused?
[43:29.92]It is my friend?
[43:32.67]Um.
[43:33.75]Oh.
[43:35.43]Is that what that button does?
[43:36.27]Because it gives you like a random animal friend?
[43:37.98]I've never pressed that.
[43:39.88]Guys, I've never played this part.
[43:41.00]I don't even know what this button does.
[43:42.14]They didn't tell me what it does.
[43:43.36]It's just a button down.
[43:46.38]There's a button down here that says Beast Master.
[43:48.80]I have no idea what it is.
[43:50.74]Press T.
[44:05.32]What the hell are we doing?
[44:15.68]What does this do?
[44:16.38]I mean, that was really cool, but what did it do?
[44:23.68]Alright, let's get gathering canes.
[44:28.87]Let's get some more food.
[44:34.23]We need to go out to the trees and get some more food.
[44:39.91]Hey, what are you doing?
[44:43.03]I just spanked him.
[44:45.41]Why?
[44:47.15]What are you doing?
[44:48.43]Get back here.
[44:49.29]Get back here, you idiot.
[44:51.14]You mess with my friends.
[44:51.92]This is my house.
[44:53.52]Get out of here.
[44:56.24]Get away from me.
[44:56.74]He's not going to die, is he?
[45:01.02]Somebody help him.
[45:03.35]Somebody help him.
[45:04.01]Somebody help him.
[45:04.57]Somebody help him.
[45:06.35]Stop.
[45:06.59]Stop.
[45:06.79]Stop.
[45:06.95]Stop.
[45:07.09]Stop.
[45:07.27]Stop.
[45:07.43]Stop.
[45:07.61]Somebody help him.
[45:08.98]Somebody help him.
[45:09.74]Stop skiing around.
[45:10.98]Okay.
[45:15.08]Now eat him.
[45:15.74]Are we gathering?
[45:21.22]We are.
[45:21.54]Okay.
[45:26.14]Speaking of saving the game, I really should do that, shouldn't I?
[45:29.60]It's been a while.
[45:37.15]Aggressive.
[45:38.23]Aggressive tribes try to exterminate the competition.
[45:40.41]They ruthlessly attack and hoard all the resources for themselves.
[45:45.80]That's not what happened, though.
[45:46.74]People are attacking me.
[45:49.26]Are we watching the same game?
[45:50.50]Are we playing the same game?
[45:53.08]I was sitting there trying to dance and do the horns and dance with the other tribe, and I got attacked three times.
[46:01.75]So I retaliated.
[46:02.65]What, I can't retaliate?
[46:03.57]Nice, Ron.
[46:07.98]Fuck.
[46:10.46]Is it only defending?
[46:22.56]Yeah, I'm just defending.
[46:25.48]Everybody has those little sticks, right?
[46:27.62]Make sure everybody has one of those.
[46:28.63]Yeah, they do.
[46:36.93]Self-defense massacre.
[46:40.87]Um.
[46:43.22]I mean.
[46:45.70]What do you want to say?
[46:46.70]I need to.
[46:51.16]I want to.
[46:52.12]Let's go to Brown.
[46:53.52]How's Brown doing?
[46:55.14]You okay?
[46:56.64]They're doing alright.
[46:57.18]Yeah.
[47:04.91]Alright, there are... There's this group over here.
[47:07.73]Have they attacked me before?
[47:11.67]I think they have.
[47:12.61]I don't think Green has, though.
[47:13.53]Yeah, they have.
[47:13.91]These guys attack all the time.
[47:21.16]Well, maybe... Okay, I'm going to go over there with some instruments.
[47:25.82]Maybe I can be friends with them.
[47:30.12]They're dicks?
[47:30.98]Okay.
[47:32.56]Round Village is offering your tribe a gift.
[47:34.28]Ooh, okay.
[47:35.24]Thanks, guys.
[47:35.70]Can somebody repair?
[47:40.06]Okay, they can repair it.
[47:40.82]Yeah, repair this, guys.
[47:48.37]The village is under... There's a lot of stress here on this village.
[47:51.57]Here they come.
[47:57.91]I gotta give them a gift, too.
[47:58.97]They just keep giving me presents.
[48:07.11]What is it?
[48:07.63]Is it food?
[48:10.47]Thank you.
[48:13.17]What is in there?
[48:13.71]Oh shit, 10 food.
[48:20.27]Alright, I'm going to give them a gift.
[48:22.55]I'm going to bring them a gift.
[48:24.26]Of what should I bring them?
[48:27.02]About, um... The gift of dance.
[48:31.20]How about that?
[48:32.40]The gift of death.
[48:34.32]No.
[48:35.24]The gift of dance.
[48:37.93]Raiders are spotted.
[48:38.65]Another tribe is attacking.
[48:39.53]Oh, are they?
[48:42.78]Spears.
[48:43.98]Who is it?
[48:44.28]Alright, it's green.
[48:46.32]I'm going to wipe out green, by the way.
[48:47.92]Green's getting wiped out after this.
[48:50.90]I'm sick of this shit.
[48:55.16]Get the spear.
[48:55.58]Stop preparing it.
[48:56.37]Get a spear.
[48:56.97]Okay.
[49:01.41]Attack!
[49:06.74]It's freaking me out that green is purple.
[49:12.15]Don't you think that's weird?
[49:18.15]Green is purple.
[49:21.09]I guess they are kind of green.
[49:28.63]Wait, am I even blue?
[49:29.95]I'm red.
[49:31.03]Oh.
[49:36.15]Kill the chief.
[49:43.74]Okay, what about... Do I have healing rods?
[49:47.34]Alright, here's what we're going to do.
[49:50.38]I'm not going into attack yet.
[49:51.42]I'm going to make some babies.
[49:53.82]Two of you guys are getting healing rods.
[50:02.33]There's three McDonald's.
[50:03.73]What?
[50:06.40]Okay, two healing rods.
[50:07.40]Are you holding a broom?
[50:08.88]Alright, you're good.
[50:10.22]Come over here.
[50:10.68]Group up together.
[50:12.19]One of you guys is holding a gathering stick.
[50:14.93]So, please get a spear.
[50:22.54]Okay.
[50:23.56]Is everything repaired?
[50:26.78]It is.
[50:26.98]Alright.
[50:29.00]So, I'm going over to green.
[50:31.56]And I'm going to kill green.
[50:39.61]Let's move.
[50:46.77]They're all babies.
[50:47.35]We're fine.
[50:48.59]They got nothing either.
[50:49.23]We're going to conquer this whole place.
[50:53.67]Kill the chief.
[50:54.51]Go right for the chief.
[50:55.67]Right for the throat.
[51:02.74]Get in there.
[51:05.20]Attack.
[51:05.58]Where are my healers?
[51:08.82]Heal.
[51:11.31]Eel.
[51:13.38]I can't even click on anybody.
[51:18.14]Kill.
[51:21.06]They're just babies.
[51:22.11]Kill them.
[51:22.95]I mean, defeat them.
[51:48.94]You know what I mean.
[51:50.08]You know what I mean.
[51:52.44]Alright, we're gonna take this village.
[52:00.86]Green is now mine.
[52:03.66]Take it out.
[52:10.19]We're okay, right?
[52:19.20]Make sure everything's good back here.
[52:20.22]Oh, there was one guy back here.
[52:24.42]Good.
[52:24.66]Perfect.
[52:25.56]Just pre-celebrate for us.
[52:41.69]These guys could just come in right... Blue could come in right now and ruin this whole thing.
[52:51.43]Everybody doing good on health?
[52:53.71]The chief is almost dead.
[52:56.26]We need to focus on... Okay, you just heal the chief.
[52:58.60]That's it.
[52:58.96]Don't do anything else but heal the chief.
[53:01.88]Just pocket medic the chief.
[53:20.65]I got two more things to put on.
[53:23.67]Was there one more village to conquer?
[53:28.05]You destroyed the green village.
[53:28.91]A third totem piece adorns your tribal totem.
[53:31.18]The tools and outfits taken from the fallen tribe are now available in your planner.
[53:39.39]Befriend blue.
[53:55.09]Your hut has upgraded again, and you can now grow your tribe to its maximum potential of 12 tribe members.
[53:59.54]Alright.
[54:02.80]All that exists is lavender and cyan.
[54:07.92]Interesting.
[54:08.46]Okay.
[54:10.87]Well, we need to get some more food, so might as well get some from here.
[54:22.08]How many more babies?
[54:22.92]Let's get more babies.
[54:28.44]Another baby, please.
[54:32.55]Remember, your tribe is the Fire Nation.
[54:36.59]Who's attacking me?
[54:40.77]Alright, get this food back.
[54:43.97]Oh, it's there right here.
[54:47.22]Just cut him off.
[54:49.50]Put the pizzas down.
[54:50.30]Just cut him off right here.
[54:55.57]Get out of the way.
[54:56.51]Get these like fucking bulls out of the way.
[54:59.50]Cut them off.
[55:00.02]We're already here.
[55:01.50]What the fuck is that?
[55:12.28]Are you guys still coming over here?
[55:13.86]Just kill them.
[55:17.85]It's Uber Eats.
[55:22.87]Uber Eats delivering McDonald's.
[55:30.70]I would laugh so hard if they just dropped a bomb right here.
[55:43.39]Okay, leave us alone, please.
[55:47.01]Okay, I'm going to use... Okay, I'm going to use... I'm not going to kill that tribe.
[55:55.41]I'm not going to kill them.
[55:58.08]We're going to use Diplomacy.
[55:58.84]Diplomacy.
[56:03.15]Because this is the last chance to surrender.
[56:05.23]I'm going to go over there with maracas.
[56:16.67]Alright, we're going to send an envoy.
[56:35.98]Bring a variety of instruments.
[56:37.27]Yeah, I'm going to bring... We have 12, so I'm going to do 4, 8, 12.
[56:39.87]I'm going to do 4 maracas, 4 didgeridoos.
[56:45.13]Just don't attack me.
[56:46.03]Just please leave me the fuck alone.
[56:47.11]Alright, we're going to do... Didgeridoos.
[56:58.23]And then... 4 maracas.
[57:05.92]And then horns.
[57:07.66]Who doesn't have an instrument?
[57:10.30]Who doesn't have an instrument right now?
[57:11.48]I feel like this is like a fourth grade class.
[57:13.62]Who doesn't have one of their instruments?
[57:14.58]Who doesn't have an instrument?
[57:16.53]Kid's just picking their noses over here.
[57:22.45]I want to have a maraca!
[57:24.39]Okay, well you're supposed to have him horn.
[57:27.37]No!
[57:28.01]I want a maraca!
[57:29.98]Okay, fine, fine.
[57:30.56]You can have a maraca.
[57:31.26]Fine.
[57:31.48]Alright.
[57:31.72]That's three horns, five maracas, and four- I want to play maraca, too!
[57:36.40]Okay, that's six maracas, two horns, and- Okay, one of the horns is broken.
[57:40.29]He just broke it.
[57:40.69]He dropped it down the fucking stairs.
[57:42.25]Okay, that's one- I'll just give it- Just give me the horn!
[57:45.39]Just give me the horn.
[57:46.33]Give me the horn.
[57:47.25]I'll be the horn.
[57:48.09]We can have seven maracas, and four, uh, I don't even- Four, um... What is the other instrument?
[57:55.13]A didgeridoo.
[57:56.38]Okay, here we go.
[57:57.62]Are you all ready?
[58:03.30]Okay, on my lead and three... Holy shit.
[58:19.53]Kids.
[58:20.69]Everybody call their parents.
[58:25.15]Everybody call their parents.
[58:25.79]We're going to make a lot of money.
[58:27.77]Make sure one of them brings a fucking cell phone.
[58:30.60]and candidly films this tomorrow and uploads it to fucking YouTube.
[58:35.24]We're going to make a lot of money.
[58:35.98]Alright, let's go.
[58:38.58]I'm going to bring a gift.
[58:47.60]Brown Village is offering your tribe a gift.
[58:49.84]They just bring me... That was an Uber Eats doorbell.
[58:54.34]God damn it.
[58:55.74]Who's fighting?
[58:56.90]Hey!
[58:58.54]What happened?
[59:01.07]Why'd you do that?
[59:01.83]Alright, I'm going in to... What is going on with the instruments?
[59:11.56]Fuck it.
[59:19.01]We're gonna take this gift.
[59:19.85]Raiders spotted.
[59:20.87]Oh my fucking god.
[59:21.77]Is it purple?
[59:23.23]Can you guys stay here?
[59:25.19]We just were ready to do our music.
[59:26.99]Okay, what if I just... Can I meet them at the door?
[59:30.48]And do music?
[59:36.37]Stop where you are.
[59:39.74]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[59:41.28]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[59:43.58]Look, I brought a gift.
[59:45.82]Take it.
[59:48.13]Stop the assault.
[59:48.95]It worked.
[59:59.80]Holy shit, really?
[60:05.68]Diplomacy works.
[60:07.64]Baracus is two.
[60:13.28]Shit, hold on.
[60:14.62]Hold on.
[60:15.20]Diplomacy works.
[60:16.89]Good thing they're hidden.
[60:18.39]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[60:19.09]Fucking diplomacy.
[60:19.97]You think this is fucking diplomacy?
[60:21.93]We're just beating the fuck out of one of your guys back there.
[60:24.13]We're distracting you.
[60:24.81]We're taking you out one by one behind the fucking back.
[60:34.86]They can't see shit.
[60:36.48]That's like, this is one of the main guys back here.
[60:40.80]Hey, hey, hey, let's do it again.
[60:41.72]Come here, man.
[60:42.50]You wanna, like, hang out and, like, play some instruments and shit?
[60:45.44]Bronk, rip his fucking head off.
[60:58.69]I missed my Q. Fuck.
[61:05.05]I missed my Q again.
[61:05.85]I'm literally watching the fight over there.
[61:08.23]I'm missing my Q. Seven.
[61:18.12]That's okay.
[61:19.74]Alright.
[61:22.34]I can't.
[61:22.80]I have to pay attention to what's going on over here.
[61:24.42]What's he doing?
[61:29.05]No, no, no, no.
[61:29.45]Stay distracted.
[61:30.11]Come here.
[61:42.98]Alright, we did it.
[61:43.67]It's a new day.
[61:54.40]Friends!
[61:54.96]No, they don't want to be friends?
[61:56.22]Come on.
[61:57.54]That was a 9.0.
[61:58.06]I let the rat die?
[62:02.12]I did?
[62:12.75]It killed the rat.
[62:13.71]Oh.
[62:28.12]I can't.
[62:29.48]Stupid fucking horns, man.
[62:30.98]It's two different horns.
[62:33.40]Stay here.
[62:33.82]I'm just going to kill them.
[62:35.12]If I fuck this up again, I'm going to kill them all.
[62:36.40]This is my last opportunity to do this before I kill them.
[62:42.28]My frustrations are just going to be taken out on the other tribe.
[62:58.71]It's not enough.
[63:01.47]I need more of a... I need more of something.
[63:04.03]Yeah, it's not enough.
[63:06.91]People don't have instruments.
[63:13.66]I couldn't fucking tell.
[63:15.40]Wild animals are coming.
[63:16.38]Well, hold on.
[63:17.50]What, we can put the horns on?
[63:18.32]I need more horns.
[63:25.12]Who else doesn't have an instrument?
[63:26.72]They do, okay.
[63:27.08]Alright, come on back.
[63:31.16]Where are the wild animals?
[63:35.74]Is it apparently wild animals coming to steal from me?
[63:42.57]Is this a wild animal?
[63:43.55]Oh, they're bringing me presents.
[63:54.54]It was another one of me.
[63:55.92]Why is there this tribe that just doesn't... I'm so confused.
[64:02.66]Okay, we'll take the gift.
[64:03.60]We accept it.
[64:05.90]But first, what do you think about this?
[64:15.21]What do you want to hear?
[64:16.47]Give us a request.
[64:26.18]Of course these guys want maracas, not horns.
[64:29.87]Oh, come on.
[64:34.21]All maracas in a row.
[64:38.30]Got it.
[64:41.66]10, 10, 10, 10.
[64:42.72]We are now friends with the lavender clan.
[64:56.49]Take these flowers.
[64:58.69]Look at me.
[65:04.27]Only three of them exist.
[65:11.16]Okay.
[65:11.80]Your totem is nearly complete.
[65:12.70]Their tools and outfits are now yours.
[65:15.14]There's only one more, um... Alright.
[65:24.17]Bye.
[65:24.49]Oh, wow.
[65:27.51]That was a big jump.
[65:28.25]Alright.
[65:28.59]I have to... Hmm.
[65:40.93]So, you've unlocked the torch tool.
[65:44.03]Cyan Village is the only one.
[65:45.13]I have to make friends with Cyan.
[65:48.29]If I want to not be aggressive.
[65:49.65]Alright, we're going to send an envoy.
[65:58.49]They all still have their instruments, so let's go.
[65:59.93]Alright, we all still have our instruments.
[66:08.00]We're going to take the band over to Cyan.
[66:11.17]Understand?
[66:12.73]Who doesn't have an instrument?
[66:15.11]Okay.
[66:15.80]Who doesn't have one?
[66:16.68]A lot of you don't.
[66:25.74]Did you put them away?
[66:26.38]Alright.
[66:28.00]We're going half horns.
[66:32.66]Half maracas.
[66:41.62]And I'm gonna bring a present too.
[66:49.47]Chief, get some food.
[66:50.39]That's spears?
[66:59.85]No, that was horns and maracas.
[67:03.31]Do all three.
[67:04.01]They're discussing science.
[67:08.92]Okay, get a gift.
[67:09.84]How do I get a gift?
[67:13.31]Your tribe is doomed.
[67:14.31]They are not.
[67:16.75]Just go.
[67:24.34]Here, we have a gift.
[67:25.90]This is for the chief.
[67:32.42]I know we've had our problems.
[67:33.44]We've had our differences.
[67:36.19]We've killed way more people than you.
[67:38.95]You've lost way more people than we have.
[67:41.23]We've had our differences.
[67:44.16]In fact, I'm not sure one person has died on our tribe, but I know a lot from yours have.
[67:48.27]Take the deal.
[67:50.83]Take the deal.
[67:58.90]I can't tell if he's trying to sneak or if he's about to wipe out this whole village.
[68:06.89]What is that?
[68:14.23]Alright, let's try it.
[68:18.76]We have maracas and wooden horns only.
[68:25.58]And if they like didgeridoos, then I'm sorry we don't have those.
[68:36.19]Good.
[68:37.71]Maraca.
[68:38.63]Good.
[68:41.90]Again.
[68:42.62]Yes!
[68:46.76]Yes.
[68:47.38]Ha ha.
[68:49.02]We did it.
[68:51.44]We've done it.
[68:53.22]Does that bring us up?
[68:55.02]It does not.
[68:57.56]It does not.
[68:59.38]It will maybe eventually though.
[69:00.60]Hold on.
[69:04.97]This guy's freaking me out.
[69:09.87]Don't have that.
[69:13.31]Don't have that.
[69:26.53]That was just bad RNG.
[69:27.29]We'll get it.
[69:34.64]Bad RNG.
[69:35.22]I'll get it.
[69:39.01]End their lives.
[69:39.91]No, I'm trying to be in the middle there.
[69:41.63]I don't want to be aggressive into the next stage.
[69:54.01]Come on.
[69:55.69]One more will do it.
[69:56.49]Give me one more that we have.
[69:57.63]Fuck.
[70:00.17]Shitty RNG.
[70:00.89]Come on.
[70:02.25]Just get the other instrument.
[70:03.13]That's too long.
[70:05.28]He's getting closer.
[70:14.44]Can we just go kill that thing?
[70:15.54]Maybe together we should just go wipe that thing out.
[70:17.77]Alright, so far so good.
[70:21.13]Just give me one more.
[70:24.75]Just need one of the two one of the two and it's done.
[70:27.77]What the fuck dude?
[70:28.99]Alright, well one of you just don't get it just Go get a didgeridoo whatever what's going on?
[70:49.08]But that's one of ours though
[70:54.83]He's just been sitting here eating.
[70:58.92]Look.
[70:59.86]Hey.
[71:00.08]Hey.
[71:02.06]Don't be afraid.
[71:02.64]Don't be afraid.
[71:04.38]We were you before.
[71:05.29]We know what it's like to be you.
[71:07.87]To be not... Because that's like an animal, right?
[71:11.79]You are us.
[71:12.75]Okay, whatever.
[71:13.29]Let me didgeridoo.
[71:24.80]Okay, bring him back.
[71:25.79]These guys, they keep just bringing food.
[71:34.03]We're not so different, you and I. Hold on.
[71:37.81]The band's coming back up.
[71:39.35]Everyone relax.
[71:47.96]Okay, let's go.
[72:02.38]Mm-hmm.
[72:04.66]Mm-hmm.
[72:05.82]If it's all maracas in a row, I'm gonna be so mad.
[72:09.90]It's gonna be all maracas.
[72:12.95]Okay, this is stupid.
[72:15.37]This guy's freaking me out though.
[72:17.91]I think that's the tribal stage, right?
[72:30.29]Does that bring us up into the middle?
[72:39.72]And we should definitely go get the big guy.
[72:46.51]You made the Scion village your allies.
[72:47.97]Your totem is complete.
[72:49.49]You can advance to the civilization stage now.
[72:53.32]Your tribe reigns supreme.
[72:54.50]When you're ready to get civilized, click the advance button.
[72:57.88]Click here to found your first city.
[73:00.64]You'll be sent to the creators to design your city hall and vehicles.
[73:13.78]Kill the pickle.
[73:16.35]I'm just curious about him.
[73:17.55]Hold on.
[73:23.50]Hello.
[73:29.48]We can't dance for him?
[73:41.78]Time to go.
[73:42.74]Time to go.
[73:44.26]Get away.
[73:45.26]Time to go.
[73:45.94]Time to go.
[73:46.52]Let them deal with it.
[73:47.72]Let them deal with it.
[74:02.24]Run.
[74:02.98]I just like inadvertently ruined everything.
[74:05.12]Is he going to come and attack the city?
[74:18.39]Lavender Village is offering you a gift.
[74:28.44]I think I'm ready.
[74:28.94]Yeah, there's nothing I can really do here.
[74:35.93]Did I get into the middle?
[74:37.57]I did.
[74:38.53]Industrious.
[74:40.09]Industrious tribes seize the moment, attacking or forming alliances when necessary.
[74:43.72]They make great allies, but watch out.
[74:47.00]Okay.
[74:47.98]Let's go.
[74:48.28]Your tribal tactics have established your earliest cultural trait.
[74:52.82]This trait sets the course for your nation's specialty in the technological research.
[74:57.95]As your nation grows, your citizens will develop unique tools that will assist your civilization on the path to global domination.
[75:02.81]Use them wisely.
[75:06.24]Very cool.
[75:07.60]I spent a lot of time down here.
[75:08.78]I'm not friendly at all, though.
[75:15.24]Let's go.
[75:18.99]Time for civilization.
[75:27.35]The tribe now dominates this continent, ready to advance from simple village life to civilized city living ahead of the rest.
[75:34.57]I guess so.
[75:38.70]What am I making here?
[75:39.52]Name your city hall.
[75:53.66]I mean, we're civilized.
[75:54.78]We know very much.
[75:55.60]We're still kind of dumb, right?
[76:05.55]No?
[76:06.55]I've never gone this far.
[76:09.03]I don't think.
[76:10.07]Have I?
[76:10.41]I don't think I've gone this far.
[76:16.30]No one has.
[76:16.96]Okay, this is the city hall.
[76:28.60]New Gronk?
[76:30.06]New Grank?
[76:33.75]Gronk?
[76:34.33]Grank City?
[76:35.19]Gronk City.
[76:38.61]Okay.
[76:40.20]New Gronk City?
[76:44.53]New Gronk?
[76:48.97]New... Wasn't it Grank?
[76:50.65]New Grank.

[77:05.00]Well, like...
[77:08.43]Like the Gronks?
[77:09.21]Like the Bronx?
[77:10.73]The Gronks.
[77:20.51]New Gronk.
[77:27.92]Perfect.
[77:28.28]Alright, we're in the Gronks.
[77:33.48]We're not naming the city.
[77:34.36]This is the building name.
[77:40.88]How about now?
[77:44.17]Gronk City Hall.
[77:48.59]Alright, that looks good.
[77:51.77]So this is City Hall.
[77:54.21]How much do I have?
[77:54.79]50,000?
[77:54.81]Wait, what?
[77:58.74]What the hell?
[78:01.74]I don't even know what to do.
[78:05.56]This is so... Should I make a toaster?
[78:11.89]Wow.
[78:12.45]Okay.
[78:12.69]Wait a minute.
[78:22.50]Whoa.

[78:27.58]This is crazy.
[78:28.22]Hold on.
[78:34.12]How about this one?
[78:38.84]The bottom part is going to be thick.
[78:40.38]Like that.
[78:42.07]And then we'll do... Hmm.
[78:46.33]It's gonna be a cake.
[78:55.17]I'm gonna make a big wedding cake.
[79:04.90]Okay.
[79:20.56]And then there's usually a little thing on top.
[79:29.32]Okay.
[79:31.43]Whoa!
[79:37.93]Whoa, that was cool.
[79:38.83]I'm not done.
[79:46.42]There's roofs.
[79:58.00]Whoa.
[79:58.52]It's a big berry.
[80:00.84]Yeah, it's like oozing over the top.
[80:13.44]This is a bird bath?
[80:22.55]It's not a bird bath.
[80:25.07]It's a...
[80:34.80]I'm not good at this.
[80:35.58]I can't do, like, infrastructure and, like, architecture.
[80:46.68]Cool.
[80:47.42]Windows.
[80:53.63]I can't do infrastructure.
[80:54.83]I don't... This is not the job for me.
[80:57.95]Off-center?
[81:00.01]I got it.
[81:00.39]Hold on.

[81:43.59]No, I don't like that.
[81:48.05]Paracel.
[81:57.29]I kind of feel like I'm playing one of those games where stuff just falls from the top of the screen and you have to go left and right to try to stack it so it doesn't fall.
[82:06.32]I mean, I don't hate that, though.
[82:14.10]I do, but I don't at the same time.
[82:16.33]Maybe a little bit.
[82:17.47]No, it's got to be bigger.
[82:21.13]Yeah, it's got to be like that.

[89:12.05]But I have to go to details.
[89:16.28]Yeah, it can't put any more on.
[89:19.12]You can't put a detail on top of a detail.
[89:22.04]Hmm.
[89:24.90]Well.

[90:04.10]As small as it can go.
[90:06.24]Oh, whatever.
[90:06.84]I'll just put it on there and it could be a cherry.
[90:11.82]That's a good cherry.
[90:12.48]This?
[90:15.46]Look, that could be a cherry.
[90:27.49]Perfect.

[90:48.32]You sit down for one minute.
[91:02.05]The cream done.
[91:24.57]People are really asking me how this is whipped cream.
[91:26.55]Give me a minute.
[91:28.21]Give me one second.
[91:29.53]You're going to watch the artist paint and when he does a stroke, you say it looks horrible?
[91:34.60]You have to let him paint the painting.
[92:03.85]Let him paint the painting first.
[92:04.93]Make sure they're overlapping enough.
[92:26.13]That's pretty good.
[92:30.15]It looks better over here, though.
[92:31.21]Hold on.
[92:47.16]There we go.
[92:48.42]Hell yeah.
[92:48.76]Look at that.
[93:03.18]There's your whipped cream.
[93:10.46]And there's a cherry.
[93:13.69]And these are going to be yellow like a cake.
[93:16.09]It's going to be a strawberry shortcake.
[93:18.89]I don't even care what building this is anymore.
[93:25.83]Bottom left.
[93:26.55]Stem.

[95:54.37]Oh my god.
[95:56.39]Alright, we need whipped cream.
[96:00.33]We need red for the cherry.
[96:01.41]We need cherry red, which is like
[96:06.26]the most, um, like the best keyboard you can get for a mechanical keyboard, right?
[96:15.62]Oh, dear.

[97:06.84]Is it like brown?
[97:08.20]Black?
[97:09.52]Is it purple?
[97:10.00]What color is the stem on a cherry?
[97:14.96]No, it's not purple.
[97:17.34]Yeah, it's like a dark, um... Like down here, right?
[97:21.36]A little bit darker?
[97:30.53]It's green?
[97:32.59]Hold on.
[97:33.63]What color is it?
[97:35.07]Cherry stem.
[97:37.90]Is it green?
[97:43.26]It is green.
[97:46.10]Shit.
[97:46.36]It's yeah.
[97:46.56]It's like an olive.
[97:58.51]Like that.
[98:00.53]Okay.
[98:02.11]It's green.
[98:03.21]You're thinking of an apple.
[98:04.17]Probably.
[98:06.07]Alright, now this is the whipped cream.
[98:07.17]We're going to make whipped cream nice and glossy, though.
[98:09.96]I'm going to make it white.
[98:13.88]Glossy white.
[98:16.66]Ooh.
[98:19.00]Ooh, big problem.
[98:35.58]It's not glossy.
[98:38.10]Oh, it's not?
[98:41.26]Does it have to be blue?
[98:48.71]Oh.
[98:50.59]Frothy is not... Well, I don't think I can make it glossy anyways.
[98:53.39]Did I miss one?
[98:56.73]I think that's good, right?
[99:01.66]Alright, now strawberries.
[99:02.96]Strawberries are a little darker, aren't they?
[99:05.82]I need this kind of, like, there.
[99:07.80]They're kind of like that.
[99:11.96]Even darker than that?
[99:14.76]Why is that glossy?
[99:22.51]Oh, shit.
[99:23.03]I could do it.
[99:27.93]Wait, are any of these more strawberry?
[99:29.65]Like, this one, excuse me.
[99:46.62]Need like... Metal?
[100:03.25]There's so many.
[100:06.43]It probably is like a strawberry texture.
[100:12.53]I mean, I kind of like that one.
[100:14.23]But that's more like strawberry drizzle.
[100:16.23]That's not, hmm.
[100:24.32]Hmm.
[100:25.56]It needs to be a brighter red.
[100:26.52]Hold on.
[100:26.96]We got it.
[100:28.80]Shit.
[100:31.26]Too big.
[100:46.13]Mm, I like that, though.
[100:51.61]Can't wait to do the marshmallows.
[100:52.78]And some of them, by the way, gonna be toasted.
[100:56.48]Some of them are gonna be toasted.
[100:58.14]And then I can't wait to hear the screams in chat about how wrong you were.
[101:02.56]How sad you were that you doubted me.
[101:05.10]That you doubted me for even a second.
[101:19.68]That's pretty good.
[101:21.48]That's pretty good, guys.
[101:22.46]Just needs to be the right color.
[101:28.48]Strawberries are a little darker.
[101:32.08]Not like that, though.
[101:36.51]No.
[101:43.87]And these seeds are going to be... They're black, right?
[101:48.76]Strawberry, what color is the strawberry?
[101:53.40]I know, you know it's a strawberry's red, but it's like, wait, some of them can be like kind of green, can't they?
[101:57.26]Wait, does that mean that they're rotten?
[102:00.71]I've eaten tons of them.
[102:03.47]Strawberry, mmm, it's like a deep, deep red.
[102:06.49]Like here.
[102:11.03]Really, what?
[102:20.57]Is that really the same color?
[102:23.83]What's going on?
[102:28.24]Um, did I break it?
[102:28.92]I think I broke it.
[102:39.50]You're choosing two colors.
[102:41.61]Oh, fuck.
[102:49.22]Oh shit, okay.
[102:49.96]Hold on.
[102:54.92]It's even more red.
[102:55.92]That's less orange, more red.
[102:59.46]Getting there.
[102:59.82]Maybe one more?
[103:00.72]Into here?
[103:04.12]There it is.
[103:04.40]And then this is gonna be black, right?
[103:16.62]Or white?
[103:17.30]White or black?
[103:17.95]Because then these are black.
[103:19.89]But wait, these could be individual sprinkles.
[103:24.39]They could be individual sprinkles.
[103:26.13]Oh, shit.
[103:26.93]Wrong color.
[103:35.38]That looks alright.
[103:39.72]I think a little bit darker.
[103:40.62]That's too much.
[103:46.35]moldy not mold that's strawberries have green all over them green black white spots yeah they're like a green and black they're little divots but then these kind of have to they oh whoops I mean those could be like little chocolate chips or something he's right you psychos I yeah look at get a strawberry

[104:16.63]They're usually like a dark green.
[104:23.25]Dark green into like really kind of like a black.
[104:26.47]I don't like the way that looks though.
[104:41.93]Hmm.
[104:45.27]I don't hate that.
[104:47.83]Those could be little like chocolate chips or something.
[104:53.06]Seeds are yellow.
[104:59.42]Well, you think about this while I go pee.
[105:01.08]I'll be right back.
[108:25.78]I got to play that game, by the way.
[108:28.00]Hillbrush.
[108:31.65]Oh, an absolutely delicious turkey jerky snack.
[108:34.93]Alright, give me a sec.
[109:07.66]Somebody chat said, Jerma, I seriously worry about your diet.
[109:10.96]Let me be very clear with you.
[109:13.08]I don't just eat turkey jerky sticks for every meal.
[109:19.50]That's a streamer snack.
[109:21.90]You guys wanted these tips.
[109:22.96]I can give them to you.
[109:25.18]Little turkey jerky sticks, chicken jerky sticks.
[109:29.34]They're three and a half inches long, four inches long.
[109:34.91]That you can eat them in less than 30 seconds.
[109:37.47]They're just like, boom.
[109:38.79]Chew.
[109:39.31]Delicious.
[109:39.93]Salty.
[109:40.57]Little bit of protein.
[109:41.45]Calories.
[109:44.73]It's great.
[109:48.23]Apple juice.
[109:48.81]Well, no.
[109:49.71]Those go-go squeezers are not a bad idea either.
[109:51.57]Look at that, dude.
[109:58.70]Mr. Blue, you did it right.
[109:59.50]But soon comes Mr. Knight.
[110:01.38]He's over his hand.
[110:03.10]He's on his shoulder.
[110:03.74]Never mind.
[110:04.08]I'll remember you this way.
[110:05.30]I've seen a lot of negative weirdos lately in Germany.
[110:08.54]So I drew a positive thing.
[110:09.58]A lot of negative weirdos.
[110:19.37]You're eating dog treats.
[110:20.39]Those turkey... What did you say?
[110:21.57]Let's see.
[110:22.19]Let me see what the negative person said.
[110:24.17]Just... Those turkey sticks are treats for Otto.
[110:27.60]Oh.
[110:33.01]listen yeah I will tell you turkey any beef jerky stick I'm not talking about slim Jim slim jims are disgusting I've eaten plenty of them over my lifetime okay they're gross and they stink
[110:53.49]All jerky sticks smell like the inside of a dog treat bag.
[110:58.07]They do.
[110:59.31]They smell like dog food.
[111:01.09]I don't know if they taste like dog food because I've never eaten dog food.
[111:04.59]But I'll tell you, if they did taste like dog food, then dog food tastes pretty good.
[111:12.73]They stink like a dog treat.
[111:15.49]If you take a piece of beef jerky that's in the stick form and you hold it up to your nose and you just sniff it for a sec, it's bad.
[111:23.06]It smells like bologna and weird sausage meat and just fake kind of flavoring.
[111:31.37]It smells like a dog treat.
[111:33.61]We just gave 70 subs.
[111:35.41]69 community subs.
[111:36.05]Holy shit.
[111:39.20]Zap X coming in with another 69 subs.
[111:41.94]Oh my god.
[111:45.27]That's so much money.
[111:48.73]My brother... Hold on, wait.
[111:50.65]My brother opened a bag of beef jerky on a plane and the dude in front of us was visibly mad.
[111:54.83]I mean, it has a heavy smell.
[112:12.18]That was Quake Jerm?
[112:13.02]That was pretty crazy.
[112:14.80]But thank you, Zap.
[112:15.78]That's so much money.
[112:16.77]That's too much money.
[112:18.95]We can get back to this now.
[112:22.99]Sticky note, drawing of Jerm.
[112:24.37]Oh, that's not a sticky note?
[112:25.17]That's pretty crazy.
[112:26.85]Are you coming to my wedding?
[112:27.99]Circle yes or no.
[112:35.00]Yes.
[112:37.60]Awesome stuff as always, guys.
[112:38.70]Let's go back to what we were doing.
[112:41.20]Very cool.
[112:48.05]Strawberry seeds are not yellow.
[112:49.45]Strawberry seeds are black.
[112:50.59]What are you talking about, guys?
[112:52.69]Anyways.
[112:55.71]I want to go do the marshmallow ones.
[112:57.26]It's going to be the most fun.
[113:00.60]You got the white in here.
[113:01.84]Hold on.
[113:02.34]Let me just do a few marshmallows.
[113:03.58]Just so I know what I'm getting into.
[113:06.08]And then the toasted.
[113:07.41]Hold on.
[113:11.08]Oh, this is going to be so cool.
[113:13.50]Oh my God.
[113:15.52]Look at that.
[113:16.18]Look at it.
[113:17.24]Just look at it for a second.
[113:33.28]Maybe some more toasted ones.
[113:46.53]Oh, it's too toasted.
[113:47.51]Way too toasted.
[113:53.45]That's way too toasted.
[113:55.75]Too much.
[113:59.87]Is some of them just being made out of wood?
[114:01.29]That looks good.
[114:04.09]Mmm.
[114:09.20]Oh.
[114:12.54]Oh, it's close, but it's not close enough.
[114:29.23]Alright, orange.
[114:36.81]Some of them get like that though.
[114:46.96]No, not mine.
[114:47.94]What are you talking about?
[114:52.33]There's many tiers of how to enjoy a roasted marshmallow.
[114:55.79]There's stick it on the stick and just warm it up a little.
[114:59.09]So it's just the heat is inside of the middle.
[115:03.08]And it's a little gooey.
[115:03.96]It's not toasted at all.
[115:04.74]It's just warmed.
[115:05.80]That's tier one.
[115:07.32]Tier two is you put it on the stick and you rotisserie it perfectly until the outside edge is like, I would say slightly brown.
[115:17.50]And then it crunches in your mouth.
[115:19.18]It pulls back.
[115:19.84]It's super gooey, super warm in the middle.
[115:22.24]And it's viscous in the middle.
[115:24.11]That's tier two.
[115:25.55]Tier three is the full-on nuclear mode.
[115:28.57]That's when you let it catch fire.
[115:30.83]You just let the thing burn.
[115:32.41]The whole thing.
[115:33.75]Until it's black.
[115:35.49]Blow it out.
[115:36.43]And then you take that skin off.
[115:38.62]It's like crispy fucking chicken skin.
[115:41.90]But marshmallow.
[115:43.34]And you eat that first.
[115:44.26]And then there's this little center of just liquid.
[115:48.16]But it's still kind of a solid.
[115:49.82]That's tier three.
[115:51.28]Tier four is you let it light on fire.
[115:54.39]You sit there and you let it burn.
[115:55.97]It falls off.
[115:56.85]It falls off into the fire.
[115:58.81]And you're like, oh, shit.
[116:00.87]And then three or four hours later, after the fire goes out, you go in there and you find it.
[116:06.46]And it's this little black speck in there.
[116:09.50]You take your finger.
[116:10.38]You lick your finger.
[116:11.54]You touch this little black speck.
[116:12.92]And then you go...
[116:17.86]It's tier four.
[116:21.88]Don't do that, though.
[116:22.88]That's actually horrible.
[116:23.96]That's really bad for you.
[116:25.30]Don't do that.
[116:26.44]Nobody does that.
[116:27.08]I don't do that.
[116:27.96]It was made.
[116:28.44]It was set for comedic purposes only.
[116:31.27]There you go.
[116:36.21]Ooh!
[116:37.43]I like that.
[116:38.77]This looks good.
[116:40.09]I think this is the one.
[116:41.21]At least some of them can be that.
[116:49.67]Holy shit, I love it.
[116:55.80]Hmm.
[116:57.80]Yep.
[117:01.14]Gotta get a little bit of variety.
[117:02.10]Needs to be darker.
[117:11.01]There we go.
[117:15.74]Oh, and I will actually scream in your face if you tell me that the toasted marshmallow... The toasted marshmallow jelly belly is not the best one.
[117:35.35]If you say buttered popcorn is, leave now and don't come back.
[117:51.16]I'm just kidding.
[117:51.66]You can stay.
[117:55.56]Okay.
[117:55.98]I'm kidding.
[117:58.17]I'm kidding.
[117:58.55]You can stay.
[117:59.15]Don't worry.
[117:59.47]It was a joke.
[118:04.39]Look at that.
[118:05.15]It's so toasted and roasted.
[118:06.79]Alright.
[118:07.57]I got to settle down.
[118:08.35]Relax, dude.
[118:15.55]This is making me want dessert.
[118:19.89]Permaban links, please.
[118:21.09]Permaban links.
[118:21.89]We will.
[118:23.07]Oh, eventually.
[118:27.56]Links are going to turn into something else, probably.
[118:34.04]These roasted marshmallows.
[118:36.65]With the texture on them, too.
[118:41.47]Please, God, not my links.
[118:43.43]Don't worry.
[118:46.71]The cherry is okay, maybe.
[118:47.67]Hmm.
[118:54.26]You guys blew it?
[119:00.01]Well, the links are not going to go away, but I want to find a solution to make them not very spammable.
[119:07.05]And look, I've been looking for solutions and quotes for tons of things over the years, so I don't know.
[119:12.65]That looks just like the Jelly Belly Jelly Bean.
[119:15.07]Oh, I wish I had a huge plate of those right now.
[119:19.04]Alright.
[119:25.52]Next is the cake, which this has to be like a yellow.
[119:29.40]Damn it, this is making me so hungry.
[119:45.75]Yeah, it's got to be like a spongy material.
[119:47.39]And this kind of looks like dinosaur skin.
[119:56.10]Spongy.
[120:01.06]Mmm.
[120:09.96]Mmm.
[120:10.46]No, this is like wood.
[120:11.35]Mmm.
[120:16.09]Mmm.
[120:17.47]Mmm.
[120:18.83]Mmm.
[120:19.79]No.
[120:22.93]Mmm.
[120:25.43]Mmm.
[120:27.23]Maybe.
[120:37.26]This could be ice cream.
[120:39.63]Wait, this could be ice cream, couldn't it?
[120:55.42]It's dipping dots.
[120:56.58]Hold on.
[120:57.00]I need to get the right color.
[120:59.15]I'll reverse that.
[121:06.35]Shit.
[121:09.73]Ice cream with fudge sauce.
[121:11.37]Mmm.
[121:12.09]That's not a bad idea.
[121:12.83]Why is it doing that?
[121:30.10]That could be, but it needs to be like a brown.
[121:46.24]This is making me so hungry.
[121:49.64]Look at how delicious this looks.
[121:51.70]This is actually making me really hungry.
[121:54.97]It's like chocolate and sponge cake marshmallow.
[122:03.59]Oh, Jesus.
[122:04.43]I need ice cream on this, though.
[122:12.94]Oh my fucking God.
[122:43.14]Hey, I'm trying to copy this.
[122:49.56]Oh my god.
[122:50.78]A little bit more.
[122:51.89]One more.
[123:03.26]Don't forget about the color right now.
[123:05.82]They're not eggs.
[123:06.34]Forget about the color.
[123:44.88]Holy shit.
[123:45.60]Okay, I'm almost done.
[123:48.60]One more in the back.
[123:49.18]A bit higher.
[123:59.67]Just like a two scoop right here.
[124:04.63]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[124:05.41]Not good enough.
[124:06.09]There it is.
[124:06.35]Holy shit.
[124:09.47]Okay, wait.
[124:09.93]A little bit lower.
[124:13.45]Button it.
[124:19.70]A little bit less.
[124:20.14]Okay.
[124:20.44]Wait.
[124:20.58]A little bit more.
[124:22.52]Button it.
[124:22.78]A little less.
[124:25.75]Less.
[124:27.13]Right there.
[124:30.17]Those are like the... You scoop up and just drop it on the sponge cake.
[124:35.07]Forget about the colors.
[124:35.83]We're not... What color... What ice cream should it be?
[124:38.35]Vanilla?
[124:40.84]Oops.
[124:42.94]What color... What kind of ice cream is on it?
[124:46.64]Strawberry ice cream.
[124:48.40]Wait, it should be.
[124:49.28]You're right.
[124:49.68]It should be strawberry ice cream.
[124:50.80]Holy shit.
[124:51.28]This is going to be awesome.
[124:56.96]Strawberry ice cream, dude.
[124:59.16]Are you serious?
[125:03.24]My God, what are you thinking?
[125:04.58]You're a goddamn genius.
[125:13.48]No, that's not right.
[125:20.49]Should there be a pattern?
[125:28.25]Mint, mint, mint, mint.
[125:31.64]Hold on, let me get this done.
[125:36.52]Hmm.
[125:38.46]Yeah, they need texture in there.
[125:42.78]smooth strawberry ice cream that's that light pink color without anything in it is my favorite thing on Earth I just want to make sure everyone knows this smooth strawberry ice cream that barely pink color is the best thing you could that's my favorite thing in the world
[126:07.10]Eating it just straight up is awesome.
[126:08.62]Having it as an ice cream sandwich.
[126:11.20]Also, as a milkshake, smooth strawberry ice cream makes the best milkshake.
[126:15.86]I will take that over any chocolate milkshake.
[126:19.31]Any vanilla shake.
[126:22.03]Oh, man.
[126:26.31]It's so good.
[126:27.31]It's the best.
[126:28.05]It really is.
[126:28.53]Paint the sphere.
[126:33.92]Oh, shit.
[126:34.46]This thing in the middle.
[126:35.18]What could that be?
[126:38.87]That's technically part of the strawberry.
[126:40.39]Should it be green?
[126:44.23]This is technically the bottom half of the strawberry.
[126:47.12]Upside down, right?
[126:49.00]This would be cut in half like a pink?
[126:52.30]Hmm.
[126:54.34]We'll get to that in a minute.
[127:01.12]Oh, it's perfect.
[127:22.00]Shit.
[127:22.56]Okay.
[127:24.68]The wasp nest.
[127:25.60]I'm not sure anything's going to come closer, though, because that looks like you've scraped.
[127:41.56]I'm not sure I should go to anything else.
[127:43.50]I feel like that's the best we're going to get.
[127:46.24]This looks like it's been scraped and dropped.
[127:54.73]Make the antennas cones.
[127:58.83]Yeah.
[127:59.69]Wait, is this something that's better for a cone?
[128:04.93]Maybe this.
[128:05.89]Let's just test it.
[128:13.05]And then we flip this fucking thing upside down.
[128:16.69]Can I?
[128:16.91]Can I flip it around?
[128:21.87]I can't.
[128:24.37]Wait, wait.
[128:26.47]Oh, come on.
[128:27.57]But it could be upside down.
[128:28.67]It could be upside down.
[128:30.35]It could be upside down on top of one of these.
[128:32.20]It could be upside down on top of one of these.
[128:33.26]Alright, keep that out here.
[128:43.21]No, these are details.
[128:44.29]I can't do that.
[128:47.17]Put pistachio on it?
[128:48.31]Hold on.
[129:04.76]Don't tell me I can't do this.
[129:06.08]I got it.
[129:07.04]I got this.
[129:20.80]Can I tilt it?
[129:22.24]Let me tilt this shit.
[129:24.70]I can't tilt it.
[129:25.94]Why?
[129:28.68]No.
[129:34.24]Use tab.
[129:35.16]Tab.
[129:36.76]Tab.
[129:37.78]Oh, yes.
[129:43.14]I was just burped.
[130:00.81]Come on.
[130:01.55]No.
[130:20.14]Come on.
[130:21.16]I'm so close.
[130:22.82]I'm so close.
[130:34.39]I wish I could just put it here.
[130:35.89]Wait, hold on.
[130:42.85]I can't.
[130:47.70]Oh, kind of.
[130:49.26]Hold on.
[130:49.96]Kind of.
[130:52.46]Kind of.
[130:53.10]It's kind of doing it.
[130:55.66]Stop it.
[131:08.36]Control?
[131:08.82]Oh, you fucked it up.
[131:23.83]That was it.
[131:35.35]Oh my goodness.
[131:36.11]I love it.
[131:37.54]That's good.
[131:37.96]That's good there.
[131:38.60]That's good.
[131:38.92]Alright, I'm just going to make the cone.
[131:44.77]Yeah, that's good.
[131:45.55]Should I put... Hey, check this shit out.
[132:27.88]You know what I mean?
[132:28.58]Like, it fell down here and went... One more, maybe.
[132:32.16]Like, right there.
[132:32.58]Remember, you still have four more things to build.
[132:52.15]You need to hurry up if you want to actually play.
[132:53.75]What?
[132:53.91]What are you talking about?
[133:04.26]Is this too much?
[133:05.88]I don't know.
[133:06.60]What do you think?
[133:07.84]Is it spilling over the side too much?
[133:11.96]It's getting a little busy.
[133:16.30]Hmm.
[133:26.71]Better.
[133:35.04]Hold on.
[133:41.96]And then, hmm.
[133:44.27]I need to make the cone different color.
[133:46.33]This took an hour.
[133:47.05]I mean, yeah, sure.
[133:51.63]We have to make a spoon over there.
[133:52.93]Yeah, definitely.
[133:54.45]Good idea.
[133:54.91]That's a really good idea.
[133:56.15]What a perfect idea.
[133:57.20]It's going to be waffle shaped.
[134:02.88]Oh, my God.
[134:03.56]Look at this ship.
[134:13.53]Wait, reverse those colors.
[134:20.79]I need to reverse that.
[134:27.75]It needs to be darker up here.
[134:29.67]Wait, should I reverse it?
[134:32.84]I need to flip these colors.
[134:37.00]How do I get to that one?
[134:37.78]Okay, that one's like a light
[134:40.53]No.
[134:41.49]Where did I get that from?
[134:43.29]This one, right?
[134:43.97]Okay.
[134:46.83]Nope.
[134:47.33]How did I get that color?
[134:49.89]How did I get this?
[134:56.07]How did I get that color?
[135:02.19]Close, close.
[135:03.09]One more up.
[135:05.09]It's close enough.
[135:05.73]Okay, and then I need this one to be this.
[135:14.96]A little lighter.
[135:15.38]Okay, let's try it.
[135:21.38]Shit.
[135:24.08]Why, are people bored?
[135:25.12]Are you bored?
[135:27.50]Oh, well, whatever.
[135:30.02]Look at this.
[135:30.48]I'm making a masterpiece.
[135:31.70]It was better the other way.
[135:33.81]Yeah, it was.
[135:37.27]I want this to be darker, though.
[135:40.13]By a little bit.
[135:44.91]Not that dark.
[135:49.61]No, no.
[135:49.93]What are you doing?
[135:52.98]This top one needs to be darker.
[135:59.48]Fuck.
[136:10.17]Give me like a chocolate cone.
[136:13.06]Mmm, I like that.
[136:13.76]I kind of like the chocolate cone.
[136:15.70]Stop building.
[136:16.46]What?
[136:21.25]What's wrong?
[136:21.69]What's going on here?
[136:22.31]People are bored.
[136:31.05]Well, get up and do some jumping jacks.
[136:32.53]What do you want me to tell you?
[136:34.30]I'm having fun making my ice cream house.
[136:46.73]Maybe I shouldn't mess with it.
[136:47.59]Maybe it is good that way.
[136:48.93]Hmm.
[136:53.27]That needs to be so much... A little bit darker, but I can't get it.
[136:56.49]I don't even know where the color is to do that.
[137:01.27]Maybe... No, not that.
[137:03.06]Yellow?
[137:03.38]It's like this brown.
[137:05.56]No.
[137:13.39]I'm just gonna leave it.
[137:14.57]I don't want to mess with it.
[137:15.87]It's good the way it is.
[137:17.93]Alright, I need a spoon now.
[137:22.13]Is this a late Saturday vibe?
[137:23.47]Yeah, we're just hanging out, man.
[137:26.77]When this is done, you're gonna love it.
[137:29.67]Change the door color.
[137:30.56]I will.
[137:31.46]That's gonna be fucking pistachio.
[137:32.62]It's gonna be like mint or something.
[137:34.76]I don't know.
[137:37.46]I just got here.
[137:38.00]I'm just joining chat's rage.
[137:39.48]Oh, well.
[137:47.09]Do the x-ray?
[137:47.75]Alright, I need to... I want a spoon over here if I can do it.
[137:54.08]I have to... Okay, here's the... You want to know the best part about what you're watching right now?
[137:58.30]Like an hour is going into this one.
[137:59.86]Two hours is going into this one.
[138:01.72]The next three buildings I have to make are going to be cubes.
[138:05.71]All that matters is the ice cream house.
[138:12.55]We've got some good spoon potential here.
[138:17.07]This right here, that's a spoon to me.
[138:20.99]I just got to spin it around.
[138:21.95]And put it in the ice cream.
[138:34.36]Oh, hell yeah.
[138:38.34]Look at this.
[138:38.66]Are you kidding me?
[138:41.03]Are you kidding me?
[138:42.67]Are you kidding me?
[139:01.59]Tab.
[139:01.89]Are you kidding?
[139:16.80]Only real Jerma fans watch him play with ice cream for an hour.
[139:19.28]Hey, thanks.
[139:29.93]Hey!
[139:35.24]What's going on here?
[139:37.84]Did you sell that?
[139:39.96]What?
[139:50.75]What the fuck?
[139:59.90]Okay, how do I move it?
[140:01.60]How do I free move it?
[140:04.09]Don't sell.
[140:04.73]Why does it want me to sell this?
[140:07.83]Because control can only move it up and down.
[140:09.29]How do I move it left and right?
[140:10.25]Because I can only move it up and down with control.
[140:14.80]Shift the other way?
[140:16.40]Shift is left and right?
[140:17.26]It's not.
[140:17.70]What's left and right?
[140:20.92]Hold.
[140:22.36]Hold shift.
[140:23.26]Hold shift.
[140:23.74]I can't go left and right.
[140:25.26]I can only go up and down with both shift and control.
[140:28.15]Hold alt.
[140:29.53]No, up and down.
[140:32.28]Ab?
[140:33.34]Holding tab makes me just go up and down.
[140:36.52]Wait, hold on.
[140:37.16]Shift.
[140:38.32]Oh, no, no.
[140:38.98]They were right.
[140:39.39]They were right.
[140:39.73]We're good.
[140:39.95]We're good.
[140:40.17]We're good.
[140:40.39]Everything's fine.
[140:41.13]Everyone can relax.
[140:53.73]Get that shit out of here.
[140:54.63]It wants me to sell it.
[140:56.71]No.
[140:56.89]No.
[140:59.54]I'm not.
[141:00.40]I don't want to sell this.
[141:01.46]I'm not going to sell it.
[141:02.14]Why are you making me try to sell it?
[141:03.86]Fuck off.
[141:14.45]Okay.
[141:14.97]Now let's bring it back up.
[141:15.75]Pull it this way.
[141:19.88]I'm not going to sell it.
[141:21.34]Stop doing this.
[141:22.40]I don't know why it's doing that.
[141:39.79]What the fuck, dude?
[141:41.01]Why is it doing that?
[141:41.75]Hey!
[141:49.04]Never sell.
[141:52.04]Is it out of bounds?
[142:00.64]Out of bounds?
[142:02.32]What?
[142:03.77]That's annoying.
[142:12.42]Well, I guess I'm going to do it this way.
[142:13.74]And then this is it.
[142:23.69]Why'd you have to do that?
[142:26.65]Oh, game, you're really pissing me off now.
[142:29.39]Now you're making me angry.
[142:30.19]Now you're just upsetting me.
[142:47.24]It's so close.
[142:51.93]Alright, I have it in position.
[142:55.51]It's in position.
[142:56.03]It's in position.
[143:10.35]Almost.
[143:12.79]Tilt it.
[143:17.35]Right there.
[143:17.95]Oh, it's close.
[143:21.39]Come on.
[143:23.62]Come on.
[143:25.88]Got it.
[143:26.56]Done.
[143:28.28]Done.
[143:31.73]Metallica.
[143:52.92]It can be better.
[143:56.80]Oh, it's so you don't look at it.
[143:58.10]It's like kind of, it's slowly almost falling off the spoon.
[144:05.84]Whoa.
[144:06.20]Cool.
[144:06.52]Alright.
[144:07.62]We can be better than that though.
[144:11.90]I get a golden spoon.
[144:15.10]I'm just seeing what's available.
[144:21.73]blue plastic spoon.
[144:29.89]That looks pretty good too.
[144:30.63]I think that's it.
[144:42.84]That's the one.
[145:03.08]There.
[145:04.92]Door.
[145:05.20]Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[145:05.80]Okay.
[145:09.72]The doors.
[145:10.12]What are the doors going to be?
[145:14.09]Strawberry.
[145:14.93]Marshmallows.
[145:17.45]What goes with strawberry marshmallows?
[145:19.15]Chocolate syrup.
[145:22.67]Graham crackers.
[145:24.05]Yep.
[145:26.23]Graham cracker doors.
[145:28.01]Graham cracker doors and graham cracker windows.
[145:29.95]That's perfect.
[145:33.15]We need a good texture for Graham cracker though.
[145:35.21]I mean, that's not bad.
[145:44.44]That's pretty good.
[145:55.69]Oh, hell yeah.
[146:00.78]And the middle here, though, the middle here needs to be something.
[146:05.99]What?
[146:07.55]What is this?
[146:08.39]This middle part.
[146:16.85]Graham crackers sitting on.
[146:18.15]Oh, my God.
[146:19.03]Chocolate.
[146:21.51]It'd be dark brown like it's dipped in chocolate.
[146:27.54]Give it a look.
[146:46.32]So this is the chocolate, but it's already been bitten.
[146:52.17]The cherry needs to be glossy.
[146:55.37]Glossy cherry.
[146:56.01]Glossy cherry.
[146:56.65]Right, right, right.
[146:57.17]Hold on.
[146:57.37]I'll get you.
[147:01.21]Glossy cherry.
[147:06.49]And go.
[147:10.35]Yellow seeds.
[147:10.99]Yellow seeds.
[147:11.75]Yellow seeds.
[147:12.43]Yellow seeds.
[147:17.71]Oh, shit.
[147:18.09]These gotta go.
[147:30.47]Back is kind of empty.
[147:31.53]I need something right here at the very back.
[147:33.29]How about a...
[147:37.13]Another cherry?
[147:37.65]Put a banana here.
[147:46.73]Chocolate banana, huh?
[147:52.50]Put a chocolate banana here.
[147:55.40]Banana, please.
[147:56.46]A banana.
[147:57.04]A chocolate banana.
[147:58.16]I mean, I guess this could be a banana?
[148:16.16]No, it's going to curve.
[148:30.88]No.
[148:35.81]Oh, my God.
[148:42.27]Oh, my God.
[148:45.42]Oh my God.
[148:51.04]Got it.
[148:53.28]Got it.
[149:20.03]Which way should we be facing?
[149:20.97]Like that, definitely.
[149:21.81]A little bit higher.
[149:34.78]Did I tilt it?
[149:41.88]I think I'm going to tilt it a little.
[149:45.50]Just a little bit.
[149:46.06]Just to go up a little.
[149:50.26]So it's resting kind of right on it and tilt it this way.
[149:56.00]That.
[149:57.18]Alright.
[149:57.38]It looks good.
[149:58.80]Perfect.
[149:59.42]Perfect.
[150:00.75]Alright.
[150:01.13]I gotta, I gotta get the banana colors.
[150:02.87]They're almost, they're not bad.
[150:05.07]It's close.
[150:05.47]Bananas are kind of like just barely off kind of white, right?
[150:11.88]They're like a yellow off white.
[150:21.41]Like that.
[150:25.15]Bananas are not yellow.
[150:26.57]They're like an off-white.
[150:27.75]Yeah.
[150:32.63]Yellow and like a brown.
[150:35.55]Deep yellow with brown spots.
[150:36.98]No, no, no.
[150:37.30]This is not.
[150:37.82]Guys, this isn't.
[150:39.44]Hold on a minute.
[150:39.88]I think we're confused.
[150:41.50]This is a dessert.
[150:44.02]This is part of the dessert.
[150:45.88]The banana is peeled.
[150:46.92]Peeled.
[150:49.31]The banana's not sitting there in the banana shell.
[150:52.49]It's peeled.
[150:53.33]It's part of the dessert.
[150:56.78]I just want to make sure I'm very clear about that.
[150:58.18]I mean, that's already perfect, but does it need anything else?
[151:07.38]I feel like it's a little bare over there.
[151:08.46]Maybe some, like, chocolate speckles on it?
[151:14.35]Like it's been splashed in the chocolate?
[151:16.79]I think so.
[151:28.72]And go.
[151:28.94]A little darker.
[151:30.36]There it is.
[151:43.19]Hmm.
[151:43.57]Hmm.
[151:53.95]Been done for five minutes.
[151:55.86]One.
[151:58.62]Perfect.
[152:01.06]It's perfect!
[152:04.71]It's been rolling around in the chocolate a little.
[152:08.41]Don't you want to just take a fork or a spoon and just smush it down on that banana?
[152:13.51]Take the piece down here.
[152:15.55]Scrape it so the little tip is on the spoon.
[152:18.21]Come over here.
[152:19.33]Drag it across here on the strawberry.
[152:21.14]And then pick one of these off with your hands.
[152:23.76]The other hand.
[152:25.26]Take the spoon you had.
[152:26.74]Sloop right into the cream.
[152:28.36]Into your mouth.
[152:29.26]Bite the banana.
[152:29.94]Bite the marshmallow at the same time.
[152:35.44]Chocolate on the tip.
[152:39.72]Oh, I see.
[152:40.10]Like, it's been dipped in chocolate.
[152:41.67]Ooh.
[152:43.79]Ooh.
[152:45.73]It's been dipped in the chocolate, I see.
[152:48.71]Somebody did a little... We're done.
[152:55.96]I did it.
[152:57.68]There it is.
[153:06.54]What about a mint chocolate chip roof?
[153:12.58]A cigarette?
[153:14.54]It's just a used, a done cigarette.
[153:24.27]No, that's a banana.
[153:26.39]That's a banana.
[153:27.29]Relax.
[153:35.72]It does kind of look like a cigarette.
[153:43.87]Save and exit.
[153:44.67]Stop.
[153:45.49]Will you go do some push-ups or something?
[153:47.93]Burn some energy.
[153:51.74]Yellow seeds.
[153:52.38]Yellow seeds.
[153:52.98]Yellow seeds.
[153:53.54]For real?
[153:54.86]I don't even know.
[153:55.84]I don't think I can even fix that.
[153:56.80]I don't even know what the pattern was.
[154:03.38]I can't get over that.
[154:04.94]This was a banana until five seconds ago.
[154:07.29]Now you're making me want to remove it because it's a cigarette.
[154:11.47]That's been a banana for the last 10 minutes of my brain until right now.
[154:20.14]Alright, I'm not messing with it anymore.
[154:28.63]I'm not messing with it anymore.
[154:30.05]It's over.
[154:31.53]I did it.
[154:32.35]There it is.
[154:32.77]The Gronk's Ice Cream City Hall.
[154:39.56]Maybe I should like put the banana.
[154:41.26]No, I'm not.
[154:42.00]I'm no more.
[154:42.62]I'm stepping away.
[154:44.32]Yellow seeds where I won't eat it.
[154:45.69]I don't know where that is.
[154:46.55]Is it this one here?
[154:47.23]I got to match the colors again.
[154:49.67]I don't think I can.
[154:50.25]No, it's green.
[154:52.35]Plus, that's like mint chocolate chip sprinkles.
[154:54.35]I think the banana is a little larger.
[155:03.80]Leave it.
[155:04.04]It looks good.
[155:06.53]Yeah, I'm stepping away.
[155:08.43]I'm stepping away.
[155:09.74]Oh.
[155:24.59]Not even textured.
[155:33.22]We're gonna make so much money.
[155:34.26]And plus, they're ice cream themed themselves.
[155:36.32]This is like the Sherbert Crows.
[155:52.70]We're gonna make cars, or we're gonna make trucks, or we're gonna make spaceships.
[155:56.81]See?
[155:56.93]Are they all questioning the guy that said he wanted to make pies and ice cream and stuff?
[156:10.73]look at the building cars and cash no ice cream you're about to enter civilization oh boy what is this name your land vehicle it has got to be it's got to be like a graham cracker car
[156:38.38]It's got to be like a banana chocolate car or something.
[156:42.42]Oh, no.
[156:44.95]Oh, no.
[156:50.83]Ice cream sandwich car.
[156:51.95]I mean, I can do that pretty quickly, I think.
[156:53.50]I can do that one quickly.
[157:06.32]Alright, in the wrapper or out of the wrapper?
[157:07.98]That's important.
[157:10.45]Should it have like half torn around?
[157:12.55]Half wrapper?
[157:13.45]Maybe.
[157:22.19]Okay.
[157:22.33]That's for me to remember.
[157:23.12]Ice cream sandwich.
[157:23.76]That looks pretty good.
[157:29.46]That's a good start.
[157:29.94]That's the middle.
[157:33.72]Hmm.
[157:35.84]Nope.
[157:37.85]This is the middle.
[157:49.03]It needs wheels.
[157:49.87]Yeah, that's true.
[157:53.11]That's a good start.
[157:53.83]I like it.
[157:54.19]Okay.
[158:00.00]I can do this very quickly.
[158:00.92]The body.
[158:02.96]We need... Hmm...

[158:10.17]I think that's perfect.
[158:14.19]I can do this one pretty... Or this one.
[158:15.43]I think it's going to be this one.
[158:21.68]I need to stretch it a little bit.
[158:45.29]Not bad.
[158:49.67]Drink it a little bit.
[158:50.89]Mmm.
[158:54.91]Remember, this is the chocolate.
[159:01.11]Hold on.
[159:01.51]Just to make sure that... I got question marks.
[159:05.56]And I got, like, what is he doing when I made the first marshmallow.
[159:08.80]So I would like everyone to just relax.

[160:10.36]Or should it be underneath the car?
[160:23.56]No.
[160:23.94]Okay.
[160:24.18]I'm just going to make the car.
[160:25.41]This is making me so hungry for dessert.
[160:28.27]The wheels are going to be big.
[160:29.31]Big Oreos.
[160:30.07]Because they're like tiny.
[160:31.07]Don't they like an inch or two tall?
[160:32.43]Okay.
[160:47.17]Oreo cookie.
[160:51.70]We'll dress this up in a minute.
[160:52.78]Hold on.
[160:59.50]Um, this is like floating.
[161:00.98]Hey, don't do that.
[161:06.92]Why is this floating?
[161:13.44]The fuck?
[161:22.81]It's fine.
[161:23.49]Shift to move the whole vehicle.

[162:08.75]I like that middle, but I need it to be a little smoother.
[162:13.85]Close.
[162:19.72]Very close.

[163:03.57]Good.
[163:04.01]Okay.
[163:06.41]It needs texture though.
[163:07.57]It needs texture.
[163:15.45]Reverse it.
[163:15.87]That's the way.
[163:19.67]I call that perfect if you ask me.
[163:22.91]You want to go look at what an ice cream sandwich looks like right now?
[163:25.63]Go look at the top.
[163:27.98]You tell me if that's not exactly what it looks like.
[163:35.17]Looking good.
[163:38.11]Very good.
[163:41.01]Oh, that's incredible.
[163:41.95]Okay.
[163:43.17]Alright.
[163:44.05]I need something else to add to this to make it... We've got to do cookies and cream wheels.
[163:53.05]Hmm.
[164:00.72]Hmm.
[164:02.64]That's got to be...
[164:04.97]Let me just get a base here.
[164:07.90]Oreos are a lot darker.
[164:14.60]Add stats?
[164:15.64]What are you talking about?
[164:17.54]You need to add capitalist parts to make it actually functional.
[164:20.36]A couple of gumdrops?
[164:28.34]Do you put gumdrops on an ice cream sandwich?
[164:39.99]But I understand why you would want them on this.
[164:45.28]It needs parts.
[164:47.40]Um, I have a, hold on.
[164:50.10]Wait, okay.
[164:50.72]I got the baseline here.
[164:51.68]Hold on.
[164:53.20]So we have wheels.
[164:54.16]We have a cockpit.
[164:55.60]See there, it's fine.
[164:59.28]Oh, this needs health and shit.
[165:02.00]Oh, that's economic.
[165:09.20]Coins?
[165:13.20]Effect.
[165:14.52]Detail.
[165:15.30]Oh.
[165:16.10]I thought I actually have to do stuff.
[165:26.42]Cockpit, but no... Whatever.
[165:29.44]These could be little gumdrops.
[165:33.25]Do chocolate coins.
[165:39.95]Ooh, I kind of like the chocolate coin idea.
[165:53.94]And they're big too.
[166:04.75]Chocolate coins.
[166:10.91]I want the big one to be visible.
[166:12.11]There we go.
[166:12.61]Okay.
[166:12.95]We got our chocolate coins.
[166:16.00]These need to be different.
[166:17.26]These have to be like bright yellow, right?
[166:19.24]Bright gold.
[166:23.08]Oh, you can't.
[166:31.47]Oh, that's alright.
[166:33.49]We can pretend.
[166:34.05]Hmm.
[166:42.45]Charmed Quark?
[166:44.85]High roller economic power.
[166:50.91]This could be one big chocolate coin.
[166:54.54]You need to look at the stats.
[166:57.37]Economic land.
[166:58.71]Wheel and deal your way to the top by land.
[167:01.75]Health, economic power, or speed.
[167:05.91]Economic power increases trade route profitability.
[167:08.38]Survive longer in combat.
[167:12.82]And speed.
[167:14.30]This thing's fast.
[167:17.06]Alright, this is an economic sandwich car.
[167:28.94]Alright, I need to, the wheels need detail.
[167:32.90]The capitalist Oreo.
[167:38.92]The wheels need a little bit more detail in the middle.
[167:40.84]Just like the cookies and cream pattern.
[167:54.95]Mmm.
[167:56.21]Too much.
[168:02.10]Other way.
[168:03.18]Yeah, other way.
[168:10.00]Hmm, not dark enough.
[168:17.09]Oh, actually... Make a ring pop.
[168:26.06]No, no, it's wrong.
[168:26.90]It's gotta be...
[168:31.77]Okay, hold on.
[168:33.29]Everyone just hold on a second.
[168:35.36]I think I've got a little bit of an idea here.
[168:55.97]I don't hate this.
[168:59.65]It's Oreo cereal.
[169:05.97]It is.
[169:07.35]Good job.
[169:09.51]Good work.
[169:11.07]You've got it.
[169:11.93]It's Oreo O's.
[169:13.07]That's right.
[169:18.63]It needs to be a little darker though.
[169:28.15]No, lighter.
[169:32.95]Yeah, that's true.
[169:33.59]Oreo O's right there.
[169:43.61]Need a gear on the bottom?
[169:54.48]Ring pop.
[169:55.04]I'll make a ring pop like airplanes.
[169:56.92]Hold on.
[169:58.58]Add M&Ms on it.
[169:59.44]That looks so cool.
[170:03.80]I love it.
[170:04.18]Holy shit.
[170:11.29]It is a ring pop.
[170:13.79]This doesn't work on the chocolate, though.
[170:15.23]This doesn't work on the chocolate.
[170:21.77]Weapons, dumbass.
[170:24.17]This is not a weapon car.
[170:26.55]This is an economic land vehicle.
[170:28.01]Hmm.
[170:38.02]Needs headlights?
[170:42.78]Does it?
[170:47.40]You have to have weapons or you'll not win.
[170:51.40]Where are the weapons?
[170:52.03]I don't see any weapons.
[170:55.73]Effect.
[170:58.11]Where do you see weapons?
[171:07.04]It's an economic nation.
[171:08.32]I don't have any weapons.
[171:10.64]Alright, I like this the way it is.
[171:15.98]I like the Oreo-O's wheels, ice cream, sandwich, and then the chocolate coins for the economics car.
[171:23.27]Make gumdrop headlights.
[171:25.21]Oh, but that's a great idea.
[171:26.84]I think I have to do that.
[171:48.84]X. Yeah, there's nothing here.
[171:54.16]Nightlight?
[171:59.88]Gumdrop.
[172:14.00]Hmm, where should they be?
[172:15.04]Right here.
[172:17.36]Gumdrops.
[172:22.25]Or no.
[172:23.37]Milk duds.
[172:24.68]I gotta stick with the theme.
[172:43.77]Gotta stay with the theme, guys.
[172:45.17]Can't just...
[172:51.33]Mmm, but they're lights.
[172:54.75]It's gonna be hard to do.
[173:00.80]Chocolate lights.
[173:03.06]Brown light.
[173:08.72]You're gonna want more economic.
[173:09.70]Put the economic stuff underneath.
[173:11.04]Um.
[173:11.10]Do I really though?
[173:23.41]Here we go.
[173:26.08]Rock candy lights.
[173:30.38]Just clip it into the car.
[173:32.18]Hmm.
[173:42.87]What?
[173:43.05]Just like stuff this in here somewhere?
[173:44.73]Just clip this into the car.
[173:53.07]Oops.
[173:59.40]Is there a reason why I can't... I can't mess with this?
[174:06.79]It doesn't want me to.
[174:07.55]I can't clip it in.
[174:13.81]Hmm.
[174:17.44]What are those rims?
[174:25.13]Now, that messes up with the Oreo O's.
[174:31.85]Underneath.
[174:32.27]Now, that's kind of hidden.
[174:55.64]Put it between the headlights.
[174:57.16]No, I want it to be hidden.
[175:03.41]I don't even like the headlights.
[175:05.71]I don't like them.
[175:07.63]I don't want them.
[175:12.25]I want it to be simple.
[175:12.99]Hide the coins.
[175:16.89]I like the chocolate coins.
[175:18.43]This is cool.
[175:20.92]Ring pop brake light, please.
[175:35.88]Hold on.
[175:41.25]But it doesn't go with the chocolate theme.
[175:43.23]There's a theme.
[175:45.59]There's a theme.
[175:57.41]What about the theme?
[176:09.56]Why can I not pick these up?
[176:11.08]It's annoying.
[176:11.58]I can't clip it into there.
[176:16.14]Fuck the theme.
[176:16.90]We want brake lights.
[176:22.60]There.
[176:23.40]Ring pop brake lights.
[176:36.15]Sing the raid song.
[176:37.41]What?
[176:39.48]Fuck the lights.
[176:40.08]Keep the theme.
[176:40.94]I think it matches a little.
[176:46.35]It does match.
[176:49.31]Who rated?
[176:49.77]What are you talking about?
[176:51.83]Put the headlights back now.
[176:53.01]Alright, fine.
[176:53.71]I'll get the headlights back because we're going away from the theme.
[177:01.56]It was these ones, right?
[177:02.90]Yeah.
[177:11.53]There you go.
[177:17.27]There we are.
[177:18.89]It's done.
[177:25.29]Raid song now.
[177:26.53]There's nobody raided.
[177:28.15]What are you talking about?
[177:30.63]Okay.
[177:30.97]I think this is good.
[177:31.45]This is an economic land Oreo O's vehicle.
[177:33.93]Can I test it?
[177:36.60]Can I drive it?
[177:43.45]Ice cream sandwich Oreo owes vehicle.
[177:51.32]Its health is bad.
[177:52.26]Oh gosh.
[177:56.24]60% economic power.
[177:59.02]It does that 230.
[177:59.58]How do I get more health?
[178:15.14]Swamp heater.
[178:15.76]Holy shit.
[178:32.25]But no, it messes with the theme.
[178:34.67]But the theme.
[178:43.40]I don't want it.
[178:47.15]This thing is just going to get the shit kicked out of it.
[178:48.95]It's because your cockpit sucks.
[178:56.46]What if I just put another... No.
[178:59.86]Hide stuff under it.
[179:03.90]It's all percentages.
[179:04.92]Oh, okay.
[179:05.30]So it's a 60% economic powerhouse.
[179:08.70]Alright.
[179:09.24]That's good.
[179:10.15]That's good.
[179:10.53]I'm done.
[179:17.13]There.
[179:17.49]Economic Oreo.
[179:19.49]Done.
[179:31.42]Do a rocket popsicle.
[179:32.90]That is exactly what I wanted to do.
[179:37.46]The red, white, and blue.
[179:54.66]We did it.
[180:01.00]The age of technology and transportation has arrived.
[180:03.00]Your city is the first to appear on the planet.
[180:05.48]But your species no longer speaks with a single voice.
[180:08.29]Soon other cities will arise built by factions of your own species.
[180:12.35]You must unify to advance.
[180:15.95]Welcome to civilization.
[180:17.86]You now control the vehicles and the city planning for your nation, starting with its first city.
[180:23.15]You must interact with other nations when they appear to begin your quest for global domination.
[180:27.83]Let's take a look at the bar.
[180:30.71]Each city you conquer, convert, or purchase will help you progress towards the goal to control the entire planet.
[180:38.06]Okay.
[180:39.16]Your nation begins with a single specialty, but you can add more by conquering other cities.
[180:43.78]My specialty is... I don't know.
[180:47.15]Move the camera freely around the world.
[180:48.39]This helps you to check in on cities or vehicles to whom you have given orders.
[180:51.95]Alright.
[180:53.31]Let's pause for a moment and learn the basic camera controls and how to select a vehicle.
[180:57.07]Hold left and right mouse buttons at the same time to pinch and rotate the camera.
[181:01.15]Kill.
[181:03.03]Hold the leeeef- Use the arrow keys to pan the camera.
[181:07.74]Oh, that's fucking Mario Galaxy's gonna make me puke.
[181:12.78]I'm gonna throw up if I get- Okay.
[181:14.08]Click on your vehicle with the left mouse button to drag a box- Okay.
[181:21.89]What am I going to do?

[184:54.29]Not too scary.
[184:54.85]I like this.
[184:57.05]It's pretty good.
[184:57.45]Alright, number four is pretty good.
[185:02.35]No, no, no.

[191:21.35]I have no idea what you just said.
[191:23.77]You just spoke a language I don't understand.
[191:28.56]Is this toxic?
[191:43.79]Don't you know that you're toxic?
[191:48.28]Oh, fuck off.

[194:01.89]Senator?

[194:24.51]Oh, it's a bow tie.
[194:25.66]Okay, I get it.
[194:26.26]Uh...

[194:57.64]Okay.
[195:11.73]Give him Frankenstein bolts?

[196:12.34]It's a Pringles guy.
[196:18.14]I still don't understand this.
[196:19.28]This is just like a big... Where is this supposed to be?
[196:21.88]Where is this supposed to be on their body?
[196:23.35]I don't get it.
[196:29.59]Is he just going to hold it?
[196:32.89]Look at his back.
[196:34.60]Is it supposed to be on the chest?
[196:37.26]How is it supposed to sit on there?
[196:49.75]Let's fold it the other way.
[196:50.63]At least tilt it.
[196:53.58]There we go.
[196:54.74]Okay, now pull it forward.
[196:55.68]This is the best I can do like this.
[197:11.81]I can't make it very much better than that.
[197:18.55]I'm desperately trying to put this here.
[197:19.89]He just doesn't want to go back.
[197:40.55]Okay, and then hold shift.
[197:42.45]See?
[197:42.61]Like, what the hell?
[197:45.81]Just put it on his arms.
[198:06.58]That's better.
[198:06.96]I don't even care.
[198:07.62]Perfect.
[198:25.56]Okay, now we need... Oh, no, no, no.
[198:32.10]You're going to stay that.
[198:32.74]You can stay that color.
[198:36.61]I mean, cock.
[198:39.63]Oh, boy.
[198:41.12]I need to change this.
[198:44.88]His mustache has got, like, Flamin' Hot Cheeto dust all over it.
[198:48.16]Does that happen?
[198:50.32]Okay, if you have a huge mustache and you eat a ton of Flamin' Hot Cheetos, will it do that?
[198:58.06]Do you have to go wash your face and your beard hair afterwards?
[199:02.54]All the time.
[199:03.19]All the time.
[199:05.58]I feel like if you ate Flamin' Hot Cheetos a lot, with a big beard and especially a big mustache, and you didn't clean it out completely, and you sneezed later, could you sneeze Flamin' Hot Cheeto powder into your eyes?
[199:23.37]Yes, you could.
[199:24.29]It's an actual hazard.
[199:30.87]That never happens to me.
[199:31.73]You could accidentally inhale it too.
[199:33.91]Oh, oh, oh, yeah.
[199:37.13]Yeah.
[199:38.75]You could.
[199:39.17]It would go right in your nose.
[199:45.06]Oh, shit.
[199:49.36]You would just smell it forever.
[199:50.64]Oh.
[199:50.70]Okay.
[199:54.63]This is part two to this conversation.
[199:56.85]How many of you guys like pizza?
[199:59.57]yeah see I know yeah settle down I just asked you to raise your hand those are that eat pizza all the time you ever have a greasy pizza and after you have like pepperoni and there's like it's greasy slice and like an hour later you just smell the oil you smell pizza grease it's all must be somewhere like on your lip or on your chin somewhere even though if you wiped it off even if you've cleaned it that smell of pizza grease stays with you
[200:26.57]So follow up to that last thing, those of you beard guys and mustache guys that eat greasy pizza, is that times a thousand?
[200:44.06]Yes, it's horrible.
[200:47.36]Because I wash my face.
[200:48.34]No, even if you wash your face, it stays there.
[200:51.02]Yes, it's awful.
[200:51.78]It's awful.
[200:52.20]It's awful.
[200:53.62]Chat's pretty divided on this.
[200:54.70]Hmm.
[200:56.80]Just wash your hands and wash your beard.
[201:00.20]Something's wrong with you.
[201:01.20]No, it's not.
[201:04.27]A kind of radioactive pizza.
[201:05.77]No, you don't get it.
[201:07.07]Those of you that get it, get it.
[201:10.77]This really does kind of look like an old ice cream van.
[201:12.91]Alright, I'm keeping it.
[201:21.53]We're children.
[201:22.93]No, you're not.

[204:49.75]Or will we hit the apex of the meme?
[204:53.23]And will we go down?
[204:53.81]What do you think?
[204:58.89]I'm not sure.
[205:00.99]It's going to increase.

[217:32.20]Okay, I need to build a factory.

[218:24.57]It's just the wizard's house in Stardew Valley.
[218:28.26]That's fine.
[218:35.60]Done.
[218:47.03]Okay, they don't like that.
[218:47.99]So should I put this over here?
[218:49.19]They hate that.

[219:46.66]Where are you going?
[219:48.08]Okay, hold on.
[219:51.96]Buy city requires more trade.

[221:11.21]I like that.
[221:12.97]I told you we weren't going to spend.
[221:14.59]I blew all my creative energy.
[221:18.61]I blew every ounce of the creative energy on the ice cream house.
[221:26.02]No, I don't like that.
[221:35.50]Okay, so they're happy about that.

[223:37.47]We admire your tracts.
[223:40.43]Your words show great wisdom.

[223:49.49]I want more trade.
[223:50.31]Give me another.
[223:50.83]I want another economic car.
[223:54.13]Double that trade up.

[224:00.96]What is this?
[224:08.72]And then I'm buying out these guys over here.
[224:13.04]How much?
[224:13.40]10,000 simoleons?
[224:16.57]Are they fighting?
[224:19.29]Whose tank is this?
[224:25.94]Cray can only grow our might.
[224:27.08]We accept.

[224:33.46]Okay.
[224:35.68]Um...
[224:37.50]It should be a lot cheaper now.
[224:38.50]I need to make a military vehicle.
[224:46.30]How do I make military vehicles?
[224:51.00]I?
[224:51.62]Create your own.
[224:52.44]Where's a military vehicle?
[224:54.74]Help them with what?
[224:56.24]I don't have anything.
[224:56.80]I have ice cream and macaroni and cheese.
[224:59.38]Factory.
[225:03.42]What?
[225:07.15]You have no military.
[225:08.13]You need a military city.
[225:09.45]Are they going to be alright?
[225:15.95]Oh, fuck.
[225:17.91]I don't want this one anymore.
[225:23.03]We have mediated it on all hours, but cannot decide whether you are friend or foe.
[225:26.53]What do you need?
[225:32.01]Your hunger doomed your allies.
[225:33.41]What?
[225:36.53]Um, I don't know what to do about this.
[225:38.25]I don't have any military.
[225:39.75]Buy the city now.
[225:41.05]Right before it's destroyed?
[225:42.13]I understand why you wouldn't want Fairhaven for your own.
[225:49.59]Name your price.
[225:50.41]How about for 4,000?
[225:52.69]Buy it now?
[225:55.84]You are very generous.
[225:56.76]We accept.
[226:00.34]That's the cheapest I could have bought it for.
[226:06.66]Isn't it still under attack?
[226:17.14]There's still... There's a missile about to hit the capital.
[226:22.67]You bought out this religious city.
[226:24.03]If you keep this specialty, you should target cities with low happiness in order to convert their citizens.
[226:30.65]You bought out this...
[226:34.95]If you keep this specialty, you should target cities with low happiness.
[226:38.75]No, we're staying economic.
[226:48.40]Buy an economic vehicle.
[226:51.06]And I want a trade route.
[226:52.04]I want, by the way, give me that spice shit.

[227:25.16]I need more population over here.
[227:31.05]Ooh, economic sea.
[227:34.40]Okay, I want to take a little bit of time to make the boat.
[227:36.20]Give me a minute to make the boat.
[227:39.88]This is going to be... What's this going to be?
[227:48.91]Make it a banana.
[227:51.29]Hmm.
[227:53.97]No, what dessert is good in liquid?
[227:58.46]It's like a watery dessert.
[228:00.42]A milkshake or something?
[228:01.62]I can make a milkshake.
[228:05.23]Make a sundae.
[228:06.21]Yeah, that's not a bad one.
[228:07.11]Okay.
[228:26.93]That's what's going to be holding it in.
[228:28.49]It has to be a cockpit, so let's just get that in there.
[228:39.39]doesn't matter okay now we need ice cream definitely no what's a fast one this is gonna be so cute
[229:23.00]I want headlights.
[229:23.60]I want brake lights.
[229:24.76]Okay.
[229:48.28]Boat plug.
[229:50.32]Ow.
[229:52.34]Quiet.
[229:55.34]Alright, let's get some gobs of ice cream.
[229:58.23]What was the banana?
[230:01.69]Oh.
[230:03.35]I don't think I can do the bananas.
[230:05.99]I don't have the detail anymore.
[230:06.99]Hmm.
[230:16.02]We can make gobs of ice cream though.
[230:26.31]Big ice cream gobs.
[230:30.09]Gobs of... I love that word, by the way.
[230:31.61]Gobs of ice cream.
[230:37.89]Usually a couple... There's usually a mound that's bigger than all the other mounds, right?
[230:58.19]Just blocking it out.
[230:58.81]I'll get it.
[230:59.11]Don't worry.
[231:02.57]Remember, economic power.
[231:04.52]Oh, yeah.
[231:05.24]I don't even need a military.
[231:06.02]I'm just going to buy everybody out.
[231:11.80]Look at those gobs of ice cream.
[231:22.79]Okay.
[231:24.01]And then this typically...
[231:30.56]Typically, there's like a drizzle of chocolate sauce.
[231:38.27]This is a sushi boat.
[231:45.31]That's a way better idea.
[231:46.07]Okay.
[231:55.30]Yeah, this is like salmon sushi.
[232:00.56]I like spicy tuna.
[232:07.31]Hello?
[232:22.18]Darker?
[232:22.48]A lot darker, like that.
[232:38.78]Hmm.
[232:38.94]It's not that red.
[232:39.91]I mean, usually it can be.
[232:43.29]That's better.
[232:43.65]This is like a good spicy.
[232:45.87]This is a good tuna.
[232:46.57]Not spicy tuna.
[232:47.19]This is just tuna.
[232:48.69]Let me get this right.
[232:49.43]Let me pretend like I know what I'm talking about.
[232:51.29]What's it called?
[232:52.92]There's a specific name.
[232:55.32]Oh, what's it called?
[232:57.38]Oh, I'm gonna... No, not Ahi.
[233:02.28]It's a very high quality cut of sushi.
[233:03.98]What's it called?
[233:08.78]No, no, not sashimi.
[233:10.44]It's actually like the tuna.
[233:15.18]No, not ahi.
[233:17.10]Toro, there it is.
[233:17.96]Thank you.
[233:18.50]God, I knew that.
[233:19.53]How come I didn't say that?
[233:20.55]Toro.
[233:26.59]California roll.
[233:27.63]What are you talking about?
[233:28.91]Alright, we need rice.
[233:36.14]Close.
[233:37.79]But not quite.
[233:38.45]Hold on.
[233:45.53]It's close.
[233:57.30]Hmm.
[233:57.46]Hmm.
[234:06.16]It's as wide as I can get it.
[234:10.96]Make this seaweed sail.
[234:14.50]Good call.
[234:22.64]I need a better seaweed, though.
[234:24.96]There it is.
[234:25.30]There it is.
[234:26.20]Just darker.
[234:30.14]Darker than that.
[234:30.58]Come on.
[234:33.90]Darker than that.
[234:43.43]Come on.
[234:43.61]That's as dark as I can get that, green.
[234:47.68]I guess that's as dark as I can get it.
[234:52.30]Yeah, it's really dark, but I wish I could go... I can't go any darker than this.
[234:55.90]That still looks cute.
[235:13.08]Where's the banana?
[235:13.98]I gave up after somebody said sushi boat and it was way more realistic looking.
[235:18.77]Darker colors are to the left, you moron.
[235:20.45]What are you talking about?
[235:27.01]Alright, I want that person to see what I'm going to do.
[235:29.04]And then I want them to be upset that, look what happened.
[235:35.70]And I want you to shift around in your seat.
[235:39.68]Understand that, look what happened.
[235:41.85]Look what you did.
[235:43.16]Look what you did.
[235:48.24]Look at what you did.
[235:48.82]Different texture.
[235:57.07]Yeah.
[235:57.33]Let's try that.
[236:04.09]Hmm.
[236:06.61]Ooh.
[236:07.47]Wait.
[236:08.35]Actually.
[236:08.71]Hold on.
[236:10.82]No.
[236:16.47]No, not quite.
[236:17.81]The texture's a little better, but... No.
[236:42.46]No.
[236:47.42]How do people even do Donald Duck?
[236:48.64]That's crazy.
[236:59.84]I think that the best I can get is the one I had before.
[237:16.36]Yeah, I think that's the best I'm going to get it.
[237:18.08]That looks the most like.
[237:21.17]Seaweed.
[237:23.03]Do a Donald Duck impression right now.
[237:26.87]I can't.
[237:32.45]Wait, why is it combining colors?
[237:37.37]Yeah, that looks fine.
[237:40.46]OK.
[237:44.38]It's ready.
[237:58.92]Okay, let's get one.
[238:04.22]Make a sushi boat.
[238:09.07]Oh, look at it.
[238:09.53]It's so cool.
[238:10.17]Okay, now we need to go... Over here?
[238:17.31]I steal that?
[238:19.69]No.
[238:21.25]I set up a... Ooh, hold on.
[238:22.47]Parade route.
[238:26.07]Check your powers.
[238:27.35]Static bomb.
[238:30.60]Bribe bomb.
[238:31.30]This ability causes enemy vehicles within a bomb's radius to attack each other.
[238:35.02]Really?
[238:40.98]Your trade is accepted.
[238:41.88]Thank you.
[238:42.24]Let's get a couple more of those.
[238:45.34]Two more.
[238:46.26]Two more sushi boats.
[238:47.10]Get some more factories?
[238:56.20]That's a good call.
[238:58.88]Uh, factory.
[239:03.94]And let's get some more entertainment over here.
[239:07.24]And then some more houses.
[239:08.10]Alright, build it.
[239:15.99]Is it even possible to lose this game?
[239:22.21]I don't know.
[239:22.67]Probably not.
[239:28.00]Trade with this guy over here.
[239:34.57]How you doing?
[239:35.73]Kray, do you have military?
[239:36.92]I need- I gotta befriend this guy.
[239:38.40]This guy's got military.
[239:39.12]Can I buy you?
[239:44.58]Can I buy- It's yellow again!
[239:48.70]Wait, I can buy him for a very cheap price.
[239:53.30]Just wait till he's almost dead.
[239:56.30]Kray can only grow our might.
[239:57.30]Yep.
[240:06.05]You're a shrewd negotiator.
[240:07.23]Thank you.
[240:18.94]Every time a city's about to be destroyed, I just come in and do the lowest bid possible and I win.
[240:25.00]And then the yellow backs away because he's not attacking me.
[240:29.70]I gotta find yellow.
[240:30.66]Where's yellow?
[240:32.55]You bought out this military city.
[240:36.75]Military.
[240:42.19]Your city's under attack.
[240:43.07]Defend your city by placing turrets.
[240:46.87]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[240:48.57]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[240:51.17]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop it.
[240:52.79]Leave me alone.
[240:55.34]Oh, this is why I shouldn't have bought it.
[240:58.30]No, why are you still attacking me?
[240:59.62]I need turrets.
[241:04.76]I need vehicles.
[241:07.23]I got scammed.
[241:08.29]Pause time.
[241:09.43]How do you pause time?
[241:11.13]I don't know how to pause time.
[241:12.86]Static bomb.
[241:19.84]Now what?
[241:27.77]Now what?
[241:31.57]Oh, military vehicle.
[241:48.81]Okay, time to make a tank.
[241:51.93]I'm gonna make a tank with like a thousand guns on it.
[241:53.57]Make it a ketchup bottle.
[241:57.75]I like the way you think.
[242:14.00]I need a ketchup bottle.
[242:15.30]What's more ketchup bottle?
[242:19.23]This is a pretty ketchup bottle if I squish it.
[242:25.23]No, this is deodorant.
[242:29.09]Hot sauce.
[242:30.16]That's kind of a hot sauce bottle.
[242:31.68]Or is it vacuum?
[242:32.66]Um...

[242:46.78]There we go.
[242:47.70]Yep.

[242:48.40]This is a little like at the top.
[242:51.10]Okay.
[242:56.74]This is going to be a ketchup bottle.
[243:03.93]Cockpit's going to go health.
[243:05.63]I didn't want more health.
[243:07.39]Double health.
[243:14.03]I don't know.
[243:14.53]It's just a fucking Among Us character.
[243:16.49]I don't even know.
[243:17.03]I'm going to make sure I hide it, though.
[243:27.63]Okay, here we go.
[243:28.61]I want health and speed.
[243:30.67]Is there anything that's double health?
[243:34.83]I'm just going to make a shitload of these and just absolutely wipe them out.
[243:41.79]Health, speed, health, speed.
[243:43.63]Here we go.
[243:55.58]Okay.
[243:59.38]Military time.

[246:19.53]Red, white, and blue ketchup.
[246:20.79]Well, no.
[246:21.09]It's a rocket pop now.
[246:21.91]I don't think I can do it.
[246:35.94]Need more health?
[246:44.65]I mean, this could just be just like a yummy popsicle.
[246:48.24]Doesn't have to be exactly that.
[246:49.48]That looks like a pretty yummy popsicle.
[246:58.09]You need more health?
[246:58.79]Alright, I'll put it on.
[247:01.51]It's like a blue raspberry popsicle.
[247:22.50]Use a popsicle stick.
[247:24.77]I got you.
[247:29.10]Oh, I got you.
[247:29.66]Don't worry.

[249:46.38]26% health.

[254:42.08]Yellow is military, and they're...
[254:45.40]What the fuck is that?
[254:49.56]Oh wait, that's something that I made.
[255:02.03]The first time we see it is this far in.
[255:04.27]Oh my god.
[255:05.01]Oh shit.
[255:11.66]I'm contacting them.
[255:13.67]Our military gathers at your borders.
[255:15.03]We greet you only to mock you.
[255:25.40]We admire your wide tracts of land.
[255:36.26]Let's trade.
[255:37.70]We've had our differences.
[255:38.60]Look, I've just bought this place.
[255:41.12]I don't know what your conflict was between... I don't even know what color he was.
[255:46.04]Was he... Was it blue?
[255:47.38]I don't know what your conflict was with green.
[255:51.44]But there's no reason... I don't know who that was.
[255:56.85]Do not attack me.
[255:57.67]I'm trying to start a... I'm trying to set up a trade route.
[256:00.37]Trade route?
[256:03.25]We do not need to trade with... Well, then you're dead.
[256:06.95]Okay, well, fuck you then.
[256:08.07]Fine.
[256:10.03]Okay, that's fine.
[256:10.67]Good.
[256:11.15]Cool.
[256:12.63]I'm gonna kill everybody in the entire city.
[256:14.33]Okay, that's fine.
[256:25.53]Any nation that gains more than a single city will appear in your communications panel.
[256:29.60]Hover over any nation's icon to see your relationship status.
[256:32.28]Check the reasons for their current attitude or contact them directly.
[256:37.76]Your nation's too big.
[256:39.58]That's why they're upset about it.
[256:42.34]Our influence continues to expand.
[256:45.52]Our crusade has added the city of Dejaveron to our nation.
[256:52.55]Who is this?
[256:57.83]Who is this?
[257:05.45]Red nation.
[257:08.36]Isn't that us?
[257:12.16]Aren't we red?
[257:19.26]We have need of your forces.
[257:20.20]Will you fight on our behalf?
[257:21.52]You are crimson, not red.
[257:23.14]Oh.
[257:25.38]We have need of your forces.
[257:26.85]Will you fight for us?
[257:29.87]Which city?
[257:32.13]Will you fight for the city of Deaxius?
[257:49.66]I would like for you to fight and attack the city of Homutili.
[257:54.13]Homutili.
[257:57.63]We could help you out for a price.
[257:59.29]How about 4,400 bucks?
[258:00.05]You got a deal.
[258:05.21]You got a deal.
[258:13.77]One of your cities is under attack.
[258:21.82]We could use your help.
[258:22.66]Would you declare war on the orange nation?
[258:28.68]Well, you know, maybe if you give back 2000 of the dollars I gave you, maybe.
[258:35.41]Will you declare war?
[258:38.40]Sweeten that deal a little bit and you got a deal.
[258:40.64]Sounds good.
[258:41.76]Thank you.
[258:42.66]I paid you $2,200 now to do that instead of $4,000.
[258:46.08]Thank you.
[258:46.38]Let's go.
[258:48.08]War has been declared.
[258:48.84]I need a turret over here.
[258:53.98]Start firing.
[259:01.69]Where is he?
[259:04.91]Where is it?
[259:08.56]Parade, please.
[259:09.87]Who the hell is this?
[259:16.25]I've declared war on Orange.
[259:17.21]Are you going in?
[259:19.39]Wait for me.
[259:19.73]Wait for me.
[259:20.09]I have tanks here.
[259:32.08]Wait for me before you go in.
[259:36.04]Such a partnership can only help spread our faith.
[259:37.54]We accept.
[259:38.58]Good.
[259:42.64]You going in?
[259:43.68]I think they're going in.
[259:52.19]What is he doing?
[259:52.67]Holy shit!
[259:52.97]It's time to show us proper respect.
[259:58.25]We demand 3,100 spore bucks.
[260:09.02]You didn't even do anything.
[260:10.30]Fine, take it.
[260:14.44]The epic creepalope, the melon, is attacking this city.
[260:22.06]What the hell is that?
[260:23.12]Alright, we're going in.
[260:26.25]Capture the city!
[260:38.94]Holy shit.
[260:39.56]This is perfect.
[260:43.50]Capture the city.
[260:46.30]This thing has instant killing laser fire bombs.
[260:54.96]Capture the city.
[260:55.64]Holy shit.
[260:56.20]He's killing things instantly.
[260:59.25]Oh, stop.
[261:01.15]Go this way.
[261:01.69]Go this way.
[261:02.07]Go this way.
[261:02.39]Get away from him.
[261:11.84]Capture the city.
[261:16.16]Why is this thing even here?
[261:18.46]Why is this here?
[261:21.68]What's under attack?
[261:26.17]What the f- Who's attacking me?
[261:41.33]What about my spice thing?
[261:43.79]Can I convert this to a military city?
[261:45.57]This thing is just an economic city.
[261:48.42]I don't even know what to do.
[261:56.22]What is happening over here?
[262:03.45]That's not the Breaking Bad theme.
[262:08.87]I want to talk to...
[262:10.58]Oh, let's talk to Orange.
[262:12.30]This planet trembles before our mighty armada.
[262:14.16]You will not survive.
[262:15.00]Prepare for war.
[262:16.36]They're about to get wiped off the face of the Earth.
[262:19.64]What's happening?
[262:21.20]I kind of have no idea what's going on.
[262:30.47]One of your cities is under attack.
[262:31.83]Okay.
[262:32.79]Okay.
[262:40.54]Your spice geyser.
[262:41.56]I think I'm figuring out why I stopped playing at this part.
[262:45.62]They're coming over here.
[262:52.13]This is just a confusing mess.
[263:02.21]You said you stopped at the tribes.
[263:05.64]You lost a city.
[263:06.64]It's like going too fast.
[263:08.24]It's like just... I don't even know what's happening.
[263:12.13]There's two different reds?
[263:14.63]That already fucked me up.
[263:15.49]There's two reds.
[263:17.09]You're crimson.
[263:17.99]What?
[263:26.59]I cannot see the difference in these colors.
[263:29.25]There's no difference.
[263:29.84]That's the same image.
[263:32.30]That's literally the exact same color on the map.
[263:37.18]There's no difference at all.
[263:39.16]I don't own that.
[263:47.16]Haven has been captured.
[263:52.42]Where's Haven?
[264:00.96]Is this Haven?
[264:06.39]This is just like, we all just took out the game of Risk and like snorted lines of coke and just started screaming at each other.
[264:12.08]I have no idea what the hell's happening.
[264:22.98]Okay, this is, there's an orange and a yellow.
[264:26.10]Yellow is down here in Australia.
[264:29.76]This is Blamen.
[264:31.44]That's all they have.
[264:33.48]Yellow has Blamen.
[264:35.06]Orange has Haven.
[264:38.34]And Humility.
[264:40.46]And then there's blue over here.
[264:41.74]And then there's crimson up here.
[264:43.22]And then there's red.
[264:43.90]I have one military city.
[264:51.65]So I fucked up.
[264:52.31]I should have had all military cities.
[264:56.01]Okay.
[264:56.59]Um...
[265:12.32]Four hours customizing only to lose in 20 minutes.
[265:17.07]It went very quickly.
[265:20.21]It went very quickly.
[265:21.63]Maybe I should contact Blue.
[265:26.11]I'm going to contact Blue.
[265:29.82]See what they're up to.
[265:35.75]Wait, what?
[265:40.56]I can't contact blue anymore.
[265:42.78]Let me contact yellow.
[265:46.44]This is blue.
[265:47.56]What?
[265:48.39]Where am I?
[265:49.63]What?
[265:49.89]That was a yellow indicator.
[265:51.21]What happened?
[265:51.73]What's going on?
[265:52.87]What?
[265:55.03]Tell me I'm confused.
[265:55.69]Tell me I'm the one that's confused.
[265:58.07]Your civilization perplexes us.
[265:59.45]What are your intentions?
[266:03.10]We need your forces.
[266:08.05]Will you fight for us?
[266:11.93]What city?
[266:13.75]We would like for you to go after.
[266:17.42]That was literally yellow when I clicked on it.
[266:25.99]Frizdov?
[266:28.09]No, I don't want you to take Frizdov.
[266:38.57]do I want haven no because haven's mine it was I only have one thing now alright send it to haven I don't have 56 I'm gonna lose what the it's blue again I wear my land vehicles please
[267:09.12]Can I take this shit back?
[267:12.46]And the fact that the whole thing's a fucking sphere does not help.
[267:14.68]It's like this... I'm going down, but my map... Look where I'm going on the mini-map.
[267:26.01]What the fuck?
[267:28.85]Go... Hey!
[267:30.37]No, don't... Whatever.
[267:33.53]We demand money.
[267:34.23]I don't have any... I don't have anything left.
[267:39.69]What are the cheat codes?
[267:40.65]Just give me 10 million dollars.
[267:41.85]This part of the game sucks.
[267:58.72]I can't even build anything.
[268:02.22]Most people love this part.
[268:03.39]No, they do not.
[268:05.81]I've never...
[268:09.26]Kill it.
[268:09.93]Kill this thing.
[268:12.19]Destroy it, please.
[268:22.19]Come on, Epic Cantaloupe.
[268:23.84]Please destroy the city.
[268:30.14]Whose is this?
[268:33.40]You know what I think the problem is here?
[268:35.97]This is from too many friends over your house.
[268:38.19]That's what the problem is with this.
[268:39.47]And this is the problem I had since the very beginning.
[268:41.69]There were 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 people on the map.
[268:45.68]On a map this small.
[268:47.22]Too many fucking people over your house to play Risk.
[268:50.62]You can't play Risk with 6 or 7 people.
[268:52.80]That's too many people.
[268:53.88]You play it with like 3 or 4 people.
[268:55.78]4 people.
[268:56.83]Not 6.
[269:01.17]That's too many friends over your house.
[269:06.06]It's too spread out.
[269:19.38]To be fair, the game is very hard while playing when you're going blind.
[269:22.02]I mean, I... I don't even care.
[269:30.37]Do something.
[269:31.05]I'm so overwhelmed.
[269:32.07]I don't even know where to start.
[269:33.21]It's like too many things have happened.
[269:37.20]I tried to make like, okay, I tried to make a trade route with two different cities and then like the world collapsed.
[269:43.21]What the fuck?
[269:47.37]It was like, I'd like to have a trade route.
[269:50.65]Everyone's dead.
[269:51.49]The world is exploding.
[269:58.76]Make more factories.
[270:01.86]I don't even know what the factories do.
[270:06.12]Oh.
[270:25.10]Remember, you made that monster.
[270:26.80]Well, why is it here?
[270:29.56]Why is it just sitting outside their gates?
[270:32.77]Is it asleep?
[270:46.46]It's just constantly at war with this thing.
[270:49.78]Oh, my God.
[270:51.36]Holy shit.
[270:51.98]Can I take this?
[270:53.94]This is ready to take.
[271:00.27]This is what you fucking deserve.
[271:02.51]You deserve, you deserve this shit.
[271:09.51]Oh my goodness.
[271:10.61]What is happening now?
[271:15.78]I have, do I have, is this mine?
[271:20.32]This is mine.
[271:20.96]Okay.
[271:21.24]I need a, um, military.
[271:26.01]I don't, I don't know.
[271:26.97]I have no idea what's going on.
[271:29.71]I think I lose.
[271:30.47]I'm pretty sure I just lost.
[271:32.97]Yellow nation is captured.
[271:33.97]The red nation is gone.
[271:36.25]Oh.
[271:42.16]How do I skip to the other stage?
[271:44.72]Take Haven back.
[271:45.60]I can't.
[271:46.00]I have to like restart.
[271:48.04]Look at how much shit I'm surrounded by.
[271:58.15]You don't have to restart.
[271:59.03]I don't?
[272:01.99]Control Shift C. More money.
[272:03.71]Bribe orange.
[272:05.57]Control Shift C. Bribe orange.
[272:11.74]Control Shift C. More money.
[272:30.47]We come offering gifts.
[272:32.29]Do you accept?
[272:33.98]Here's 4,000 bucks.
[272:45.92]We come offering gifts.
[272:47.23]Off has 4,000 more dollars.
[273:22.57]Will you like me yet?
[273:23.74]You are no longer at war with the Orange Nation!
[273:31.02]Nice!
[273:43.87]Alright, now I'm going to buy all the cities with all the fake money that I have.
[273:47.18]I don't care.
[273:49.74]I don't care.
[273:50.36]I don't care.
[273:51.00]I don't care.
[273:51.52]I don't care.
[273:52.02]I don't care.
[273:52.86]I don't care.
[273:53.40]I don't even care.
[273:54.32]I don't care.
[273:55.20]Ask me.
[273:55.84]Ask me if I care.
[273:56.76]Do I care?
[273:57.32]I don't care.
[273:57.64]Go ahead, ask me.
[274:10.23]This thing is still attacking their city.
[274:16.58]And then I'm gonna buy these motherfuckers.
[274:19.19]Worst gamer moment?
[274:20.07]I don't... That's... Hey.
[274:20.97]I don't care.
[274:22.89]I don't care at all.
[274:23.69]I don't like this part.
[274:27.28]This part stinks to me.
[274:34.84]I'm gonna buy orange and then...
[274:46.09]Explain in detail of why.
[274:48.67]I'm willing to bet that if there's 12,000 people here right now, it's just under 12,000.
[274:53.21]Those of you that played this game before, you probably don't remember you getting to this part in the game and going, I just want to skip this.
[275:03.60]And then just giving yourself $50,000 and just going to the space stage.
[275:07.42]Yeah, I think a lot of you just don't remember.
[275:08.86]They don't want to trade with me?
[275:15.34]We admire you.
[275:17.98]And we want to give you free money.
[275:25.24]You like me yet?
[275:30.89]Your people... Our people admire you.
[275:32.77]We have more gifts for you.
[275:33.89]Would you like to be our friend and trade with us?
[275:39.41]Don't... Please...
[275:43.85]Don't- oh my fucking god, dammit dude.
[275:51.46]This thing's gotta go.
[275:52.36]How do I declare you're a threat to us?
[276:03.53]Your nation's too big.
[276:04.49]Well, can I buy you?
[276:13.78]Can we set up a trade route with the other guy?
[276:18.40]Blue.
[276:19.50]Listen to me.
[276:20.16]Trade route.
[276:24.24]Hope you lose while cheating.
[276:29.49]What is going on over here?
[276:35.05]Middle is hard.
[276:35.87]This middle road is the hardest for this stage.
[276:37.49]Wait, did I get bad RNG and got in the worst spot?
[276:52.61]That's an excuse.
[276:55.89]Excuse me, would you like to trade?
[276:58.73]Great.
[277:02.45]Trade with the city.
[277:04.12]And by the way, I will handsomely pay for your city and your capital.
[277:10.74]Is it gone?
[277:19.20]Economic is the easiest.
[277:20.52]Yeah, but you guys, I think you guys are misunderstanding that I've never played this before.
[277:26.07]Yeah, when you were like 15, you probably came home from school every day and you probably played this a thousand times.
[277:29.73]This is the first time I've ever seen this.
[277:31.75]I went to the creature stage.
[277:32.61]I made the guys like elongated his tail and made a big head and then I never played the game ever again.
[277:36.10]Cheat more.
[277:48.81]Oh, God damn it.
[277:49.99]Orange took this.
[278:02.35]What?
[278:02.63]What is this?
[278:05.85]What's this?
[278:09.17]You're at war with Orange.
[278:10.17]How do I declare?
[278:10.87]How do I stop declaring war?
[278:15.25]What's the cheat to, like, drop a bomb?
[278:17.93]Give me the bomb cheat.
[278:18.63]I want it.
[278:23.62]Unlock super weapons.
[278:25.16]Thank you.
[278:32.62]Oh, this is... It's just like Steam.
[278:37.13]I don't... Get off the Steam overlay.
[278:43.49]This has been nine hours?
[278:44.55]Holy shit.
[278:53.84]Nine full hours.
[278:54.70]Has it been that long?
[278:57.12]Global merger.
[279:02.64]What happened?
[279:05.17]Whoa!
[279:32.65]I guarantee you, half of you guys got to the stage and knew that existed and just pressed it.
[279:40.65]And by the way, what, yeah, what kind of, that's just for people to skip.
[279:45.60]Click here to launch your space exploration program.
[279:52.42]It'll be sent to the creator to create a ship for your maiden voyage.
[279:57.49]Modification can be made later.
[279:58.57]Nice!
[280:01.52]Mental Gymnastics Andy.
[280:13.79]The choices throughout your evolutionary history of Go is just a straight line.
[280:16.46]I didn't do anything.
[280:19.42]That's an end game thing.
[280:23.40]Your traits affect not only your inherent abilities.
[280:25.37]Okay.
[280:30.78]I beat this multiple times as a baby.
[280:32.42]Well, you weren't a baby.
[280:33.36]You were like at least 12.
[280:36.77]Traders are in it for the profit.
[280:37.85]Their only allegiance is to the almighty Sporbuck.
[280:42.79]Instantly makes trading systems available.
[280:44.45]Pretty cool.
[280:44.97]Alright.
[280:48.74]I legit beat this when I was 14.
[280:49.68]You know how developed your brain is when you're 14?
[280:52.82]That's fine.
[280:54.08]You probably played this every day.
[280:59.02]Look, if me and a 14-year-old were in a knitting contest, and that 14-year-old knitted every day, and they were super into knitting, and they did it every day after school, and they were really, really into it, they're going to beat me in a knitting contest.
[281:17.55]You can take a 10-year-old that can juggle, right?
[281:21.12]Just juggle every day.
[281:22.30]And you put me in... Okay, you're in a juggling contest with that 11-year-old.
[281:24.96]Yeah, it's an 11-year-old.
[281:25.72]You'll be... I don't know anything about juggling.
[281:27.28]You're going to beat me, 11-year-old.
[281:28.68]You're good at juggling.
[281:30.88]I have not learned any juggling.
[281:41.32]Video games are your career?
[281:45.28]Not this one.
[281:48.05]What is that supposed to mean?
[281:50.83]That doesn't matter.
[281:53.61]All games are different.
[281:56.17]Every game is different from another.
[281:58.87]Really?
[282:06.21]This game is wildly different than the last game that we played on this channel.
[282:11.33]Wait, I'm supposed to know how to play every single video game that's ever released?
[282:26.83]I'm a professional spore streamer.
[282:29.59]This is the exact same game resume.
[282:39.64]You should be banned from every game.
[282:41.14]This is a kid's game.
[282:42.02]It doesn't matter if it's a kid's game or not.
[282:44.64]This isn't even a kid's game.
[282:48.54]Will Wheaton, when he made this, when he got on stage, he was like, this is going to be the fucking most revolutionary game for everybody to play.
[282:54.00]And everyone was like, holy shit, this is awesome.
[282:59.16]Whatever his name is.
[283:09.15]What's his name?
[283:11.29]Will Wheaton.
[283:14.18]Will Wright.
[283:15.20]Yes, there it is.
[283:15.88]Thank you.
[283:17.84]Will Wright didn't get on stage and go into the microphone.
[283:21.82]I'm going to introduce my latest kids game.
[283:23.88]This one is for children.
[283:26.17]It's called Sport.
[283:27.03]It's for kids.
[283:28.99]It's like Gonzo didn't get on stage after that.
[283:35.49]By the way, Gonzo's not for kids either.
[283:36.93]Gonzo's sick.
[283:37.83]I love that.
[283:38.27]If that makes me a little kid, I don't care.
[283:39.67]I fucking love Gonzo.
[283:56.86]Anyways, to complete that statement...
[283:59.55]McDonald's is better than Wendy's.
[284:01.46]More than half the time.
[284:03.42]I like eating there more than I like eating at Wendy's.
[284:20.66]I can't believe you cheated.
[284:26.84]You guys are fun.
[284:27.72]I like having fun with you guys.
[284:30.77]Ooh, I like that.
[284:38.87]Bully button?
[284:44.82]Video games are your career.
[285:00.30]unprofessional gamer hey you know somebody could tell you hey streaming is my career not video games does a video game really matter a lot of the time think about that hold on a second think about that it's a good question
[285:31.12]I'm an e-clown.
[285:32.83]I'm not a video game.
[285:33.91]I'm not a professional video game streamer.
[285:35.73]I'm a goddamn e-clown.
[285:38.90]Get it right.
[286:12.30]You cheated not only the game, but yourself.
[286:15.34]Yeah, I did.
[286:16.24]And I would do it again too.
[286:17.12]I would do it again.
[286:18.64]I would do it again right now.
[286:20.06]I would press control shift Z. Control shift C. And type in dominate galaxy and win.
[286:27.23]I want to make this a rocket pop.
[286:33.93]I don't think I can though.
[286:39.96]I kind of like this little guy.
[286:48.47]Okay, but the spaceship looks sick, Jeremy.
[286:54.75]Oh, what the fuck?
[286:58.39]It's worth hacking in space because it's really, really hard to get money.
[287:04.21]Well, I mean, I'm probably only going to just drive around and just look at stuff.
[287:09.74]Space stays sucks, to be honest.
[287:11.88]This part sucks.
[287:13.34]This part is bad.
[287:15.70]Oh.
[287:18.51]Am I going to be really mad at this?
[287:19.63]Comet duster?
[287:24.23]Ooh.
[287:27.33]Ooh, I like that.
[287:34.50]It's cool if you play with the tools.
[287:35.82]Okay.
[287:39.82]Goes to 11.
[287:41.37]Sausage phone?
[287:58.12]I want some, no.
[288:03.58]It's very bright.
[288:05.68]Should I be that bright?
[288:06.76]I feel like that's not a good idea.
[288:08.67]Want people to just be able to see me?
[288:14.37]Oops.
[288:14.61]Okay.
[288:25.04]And wait, there's a oars.
[288:26.86]Why would I need this on a spaceship?
[288:31.75]Sonic Reducer.
[288:34.65]Oh.
[288:39.03]Oh, cool.
[288:39.51]Alright.
[288:40.13]That's so cool.
[288:41.51]Oh, cool.
[288:58.93]Killed it.
[289:00.19]There you go.
[289:07.36]Oh, I like it.
[289:14.50]Finding Earth is the endgame.
[289:15.80]Did you just spoil Spore for me?
[289:20.74]Wait till fucking Wil... Not Wil Wheaton.
[289:25.77]Why did I say Wil Wheaton?
[289:26.91]Okay, now I need...
[289:37.12]Thrusters.
[289:38.04]Ooh.
[289:54.69]Looks good.
[290:05.29]Blast wings?
[290:06.23]Ooh, these are cool too.
[290:09.51]No, I like the simplicity of this.
[290:16.49]Ugh.
[290:27.83]This is dog shit.
[290:29.21]Oh, he said dog coin.
[290:30.55]Oh, whatever.
[290:42.67]Ooh, I like... I like the McDonald's one, too.
[290:49.69]Mmm, which... Maybe I'll just do a pre-made.
[291:01.47]Just keep it white?
[291:05.03]Ooh, that's cool.
[291:10.79]Uh, this is in Rocko's Modern Life.
[291:11.97]I want this.
[291:23.02]I think I'm ready.
[291:23.48]I might want to add one more detail here.
[291:27.52]A... Ventilation.
[291:33.86]Add gills.
[291:39.75]I like it.
[291:42.75]It's a turtle ship.
[291:43.83]It's pretty cool.
[291:44.35]I like it.
[291:44.69]Alright, you ready?
[291:46.37]Ready?
[292:05.02]Rick and Morty.
[292:38.66]It's so easy to make so many people mad.
[292:42.67]You know, I was actually thinking I was going to buy a Rick and Morty t-shirt.
[292:46.63]And I was going to just turn on the cam and not say anything about it.
[292:49.09]It was just a shirt I had on.
[292:51.19]Just watch you guys freak the fuck out.
[293:00.20]Liftoff.
[293:00.94]You've successfully developed a ship capable of space flight.
[293:03.62]The heavens beckon.
[293:04.38]The cosmos awaits.
[293:05.18]The universe is at your fingertips.
[293:06.32]If you can learn to fly this thing...
[293:16.12]Me, CaptainJerma985.
[293:19.29]Welcome to the pinnacle of existence, the final frontier, the wildest, wildest west space.
[293:24.69]You control the ship and from this vintage lead your race from planet beyond civilization to a vast galactic empire.
[293:30.29]Let's look at how you progress.
[293:32.17]This bar tracks your progress towards badges you earn as well as your proximity to the center of the galaxy.
[293:37.04]Mission... Thank God nobody heard that.
[293:39.90]Mission control on the planet's surface is anxious to speak to you.
[293:42.20]Let's learn how to communicate.
[293:44.76]This short-range video communicator is your contact to those in the world below.
[293:49.80]You must be in the planet's orbit to open the line.
[293:51.72]Okay.
[293:53.56]The flashing signal means you have an... I didn't fart.
[293:56.32]I just burped really loud under my breath and leaned back so the limiter didn't pick it up.
[293:59.28]There's an incoming transmission if it's blinking.
[294:02.42]Okay.
[294:03.86]So it's blinking.
[294:04.34]Okay.
[294:06.42]Congratulations, cadet.
[294:08.16]You've got a fine ride there.
[294:10.02]We're still adding new equipment to your ship, but we should have it ready for space travel in no time.
[294:14.76]Have you flown a spaceship before?
[294:16.65]No.
[294:17.83]Well, nothing like a test flight while the entire population of the germamite of planet Zirkan looks on.
[294:23.61]What do you say?
[294:24.03]Ready to earn your captain's badge?
[294:26.31]Yeah.
[294:28.16]Each city on planet Zirkan has launched a giant orb in celebration of our first spaceship.
[294:34.46]Really, you can't miss them.
[294:36.87]Take your ship on a spin around the planet to seven of our cities.
[294:39.62]Fly through the orbs to break them.
[294:41.68]Okay.
[294:43.24]Your immediate mission goals are tracked here in the mini mission log.
[294:46.80]You can track up to three missions in mini form.
[294:50.33]Open the full mission log by hitting the L key.
[294:52.17]Okay.
[294:53.03]Fly through the orbs.
[294:54.17]Hit the right mouse button or use the arrow keys to fly.
[295:07.50]Just seeing if you can crash.
[295:15.16]Fly through the orbs.
[295:27.91]Four more.
[295:33.80]Superman 64.
[295:37.66]Kind of is.
[295:43.56]Frash joke.
[295:47.84]Come on, give me a break.
[295:49.94]Good job, cadet.
[295:51.22]Worth flying like that, you'll make captain in no time.
[295:53.30]Now that you're an ace at flying, we're ready for you to use some of the sophisticated tools.
[295:57.55]Whatever.
[296:00.59]It will happen.
[296:01.27]It won't happen.
[296:02.55]We've been working on the ability to scan the planets and animals you discover on your travels.
[296:06.85]Looks like this tool comes just in the nick of time.
[296:09.35]The Sporpedia record of one of our own animals recently became corrupted at the same time the animal started exhibiting some odd symptoms.
[296:15.68]We need you to scan the animal so we can collect more information about the species.
[296:22.26]The creature in question is exhibiting a glowing tail.
[296:25.64]An odd glowing trail.
[296:27.94]Just wipe that part out and rewrite over it.
[296:30.26]Your ship has been equipped with a radar tool that can be turned off and on in the main tools panel.
[296:35.39]It will point to a mission targets and items of interest when on a planet surface.
[296:39.73]The radar beeps faster when you're closer to your target.
[296:42.87]I'm laughing.
[296:43.57]I keep glancing at what you guys are writing.
[296:48.24]It's like the scan tool.
[296:54.38]Oh my god, there's a lot of tools.
[296:57.24]Your tools panel is sorted by type.
[296:59.54]Your scan tool is found in the main tools panel.
[297:01.34]Equip your scan tool by clicking on it or just press 2.
[297:03.18]Alright.
[297:08.16]We have to find somebody?
[297:11.04]Remember when I was down there and I was one of these?
[297:20.10]Get him.
[297:32.87]Pick him up.
[297:46.79]Let's get doing.
[297:48.77]Execute him.
[297:49.95]What am I supposed to do?
[297:55.94]Scan him.
[297:58.10]I'm trying to.
[298:06.55]Left click on him?
[298:07.97]Oh.
[298:12.81]Well, it's always right click.
[298:17.43]What do you want to do next?
[298:18.33]Okay.
[298:20.29]Quite valuable.
[298:21.30]It is now clear to us that we need to examine the species more closely.
[298:23.48]The ship is equipped with an abduction beam.
[298:26.56]Abduct a species.
[298:29.86]Use the abduction beam found in the cargo panel to collect this creature for further research.
[298:34.07]Make sure you deploy the tool long enough until the creature is fully secured in the ship's cargo bay.
[298:37.95]Stopping too soon before your cargo is secured may result in less than desirable circumstances for the victim.
[298:42.89]Oh, I mean the specimen.
[298:43.75]Okay.
[298:46.97]We're getting Gronkh.
[298:57.96]Let's go get him.
[299:12.27]This one here?
[299:12.87]Alright, let's get him.
[299:16.31]Your active tool is shown in your ship portrait.
[299:20.51]Deactivated tool, press escape.
[299:26.28]I kill him?
[299:30.52]What?
[299:39.01]I clicked on him!
[299:40.13]I... A duct of a diseased animal?
[299:55.17]Abduct a ball-luing animal.
[300:04.44]Drop off the ball-luing within the city walls.
[300:06.58]Got it.
[300:23.46]measurably fine work cadet you've provided us with excellent specimen to research probe twice abduct once I always say now what it appears the specimen you collected was sick and is infested with a virus that is capable of spreading at an alarming rate it could endanger our entire ecosystem okay take out the infected creatures by while avoiding the healthy ones look at how many tabs there are down there
[300:53.66]Be careful when you point that laser.
[300:54.82]It's capable of destroying buildings, vehicles, and other spaceships.
[300:57.72]Oh, dear.
[300:58.28]Okay, I have the laser equipped.
[301:05.39]Now, be careful.
[301:10.29]Only kill the ones that are here.
[301:11.37]Damn.
[301:18.81]Okay.
[301:31.36]More over here.
[301:31.90]Don't fire at me.
[301:33.90]What are you doing?
[301:36.54]I'm in the air over here.
[301:37.44]Who else?
[301:43.92]You?
[301:44.14]You?
[301:45.28]You want me to kill this guy?
[302:06.31]I mean, that wanted me to kill him.
[302:11.63]Remove one more diseased animal.
[302:12.93]Why is it making me go this way?
[302:30.84]Where?
[302:31.10]They're diseased.
[302:33.04]Yeah, I know, but where's this last one?
[302:46.98]Over here?
[302:49.48]Kill everyone in the city.
[302:51.74]Psycho.
[302:55.51]That was kind of weird.
[302:56.21]It was pointing at that other guy.
[302:57.21]Okay.
[303:03.17]That's that.
[303:03.59]I need to go BRB one more time because Otto wants to go outside.
[303:07.19]He just went, hey.
[303:08.32]He just yelled at me.
[303:09.92]I'll be right back.
[303:11.26]Final BRB of the night, I would assume.
[303:12.68]Be right back.
[310:07.92]I have returned.
[310:08.44]I got some chocolate.
[310:15.61]While Otto took a poop.
[310:21.54]I'm just sitting there watching him.
[310:22.56]I'm out there.
[310:26.00]Just eating chocolate while he's shitting.
[310:29.34]And I don't know.
[310:30.08]It was... It didn't mean for that to happen, but it did.
[310:42.45]Somebody just writes, thanks for sharing.
[310:46.15]Yeah, that story did not need to be told.
[310:58.70]I didn't need to tell you that.
[311:01.52]None of you needed to know that happened.
[311:03.08]I don't know why I decided to tell you.
[311:09.76]There was no relevance to explain that.
[311:14.30]anyways let's continue what we're doing we're examining creatures laudable job you're on the right stuff you've earned your home world's respect and confidence we want you to pilot this spaceship and lead our race forward into galactic escalation and glory it's getting stuck you've earned the badge and title of captain it's coconut that's why I thought it was weird
[311:42.54]I always feel like I'm eating fucking like shaved wood.
[311:45.42]Like wood chips.
[311:46.74]Our scientists have developed an interplanetary drive for your ship, but you'll need to install it first.
[311:54.71]Use the trade panel to buy and sell tools, spice, and rares.
[311:59.43]Items from your cargo that can be sold will appear at the bottom of the trade panel.
[312:02.15]Okay.
[312:05.43]I can't.
[312:05.89]It's still there.
[312:06.89]Click on the items in the trade panel you wish to buy and sell.
[312:10.55]I'll take this.
[312:15.76]Alright, let's do it.
[312:17.16]Let's go see space.
[312:20.48]Stop bragging about eating coconut?
[312:24.34]Eating chocolate coconut?
[312:25.44]What the hell?
[312:30.55]Okay, get your spandex suit.
[312:32.47]We suspect you're not alone in the galaxy.
[312:33.89]We picked up strange radio signals.
[312:35.39]Let's do it.
[312:37.15]It's time for interplanetary space travel.
[312:43.91]You've earned the badge and title of captain.
[312:47.36]Okay, your collection might give you access to your mission log, badge, tools, and rares.
[312:54.02]Hmm.
[312:54.86]Oh my god.
[312:55.56]This is like a World of Warcraft achievement book.
[313:06.33]Jesus.
[313:10.63]Tools are unlocked by earning badges.
[313:12.83]This is cool.
[313:16.10]Some tools are consumable and require restocking.
[313:17.89]Others tools are permanent.
[313:19.49]Okay, cool.
[313:20.45]Probably not going to see any of this, by the way.
[313:25.63]Alright, cool.
[313:25.99]Let's go.
[313:27.25]Use the mouse wheel to exit the solar system.
[313:30.56]Whoa.
[313:32.12]Whoa.
[313:34.54]Fly to planet Dorgus.
[313:40.06]Hair red.
[313:41.52]Hithe.
[313:44.15]Dorgus.
[313:52.98]Okay, and we go in.
[313:55.28]Planet Dorges.
[313:59.12]Cool.
[314:01.77]Something is showing up on the ship's radar.
[314:05.33]Alien.
[314:14.83]It's a crashed spacecraft that is emitting a strange radio signal.
[314:17.77]Fly to it and use the scan tool to investigate the crash site.
[314:22.41]Okay.
[314:24.17]Okay.
[314:30.61]This is a cool planet.
[314:31.39]I wish I played here.
[314:32.31]Alright.
[314:35.01]Scan it.
[314:40.46]What happened?
[314:46.80]You wish you could retroactively go back and make a game score higher?
[314:51.31]You know how much I fought with the fact that Outer Wilds was an 89?
[314:56.99]Aliens, but no signs of life.
[314:58.27]Looks like they drew some type of cryptic map before they died.
[315:02.31]Wait, the wreck has triggered a transfer beam.
[315:03.88]Some items are coming aboard.
[315:11.68]Played Outer Wilds for like two hours.
[315:13.32]What?
[315:13.56]I beat the whole game.
[315:22.53]Missiles and Interstellar Drive.
[315:25.01]Which seems to have an unknown star's coordinates programmed into it.
[315:27.41]The wreck's damage looks like it came from a fight.
[315:29.81]The ship must have been sent from some other planet to get help.
[315:33.61]No game is perfect.
[315:34.35]Outer Wilds is close.
[315:37.14]Well, I don't know.
[315:38.60]I said 89.
[315:40.14]But I think that's because I was just very mad at flying into the sun like a thousand times.
[315:50.22]It's probably 91.
[316:04.51]Okay, leave the solar system.
[316:07.91]Get a galactic view.
[316:10.61]What the hell?
[316:17.27]It's responding to a beacon from a nearby star that matches the coordinates in his memory.
[316:20.27]This must be the home planet.
[316:24.30]Why to planet Voril?
[316:25.34]What the hell?
[316:30.90]Avalos.
[316:33.38]Planet Voril.
[316:40.48]Let me go in here.
[316:45.60]What the fuck?
[316:49.14]This is what this end game is like?
[316:55.74]It's a world.
[317:02.30]Let's keep going in here.
[317:03.54]Oh, I'm like on top of it.
[317:13.58]The end game is running errands between space colonies.
[317:19.36]Nothing's glowing on the radar.
[317:23.95]It's a lot of fun, but it's really long.
[317:27.15]Well, at least I got to see it.
[317:33.35]Scanning the ruins may help reveal what happened.
[317:46.10]Scan it!
[317:49.78]End of the Spore voice?
[317:50.69]It's coming.
[317:52.11]It's coming pretty soon.
[317:55.53]Not immediately, but it's gonna happen soon.
[317:57.01]Some activities on the radar?
[318:06.20]Oh shit, other spacecraft.
[318:09.30]The scam must have triggered the colony's defenses.
[318:10.88]These drones don't look friendly.
[318:12.14]Wait, an incoming transmission.
[318:14.83]Morning.
[318:15.33]Grox intruders.
[318:16.95]Grox?
[318:17.87]Intruders?
[318:19.35]All Grox intruders will be terminated.
[318:20.81]Initializing self-defense called Grox 999.
[318:25.62]All Grox intruders will be terminated.
[318:27.10]We are not Grox.
[318:28.60]All Grox will be intruders.
[318:34.03]Let's get out of here!
[318:43.00]Okay, return to your home world.
[318:50.30]Back to home world.
[318:53.39]Execute Grox number 666.
[318:55.81]Auto Wild is like a 7.
[319:01.09]Nah, I disagree with that.
[319:04.13]Radio signals emanating from the star.
[319:05.79]Fly in and explore it.
[319:06.65]Isn't this where I live?
[319:14.92]Oh!
[319:15.97]I got red spices.
[319:20.81]It's going bink, bink.
[319:25.13]What's doing that?
[319:38.25]Oh.
[319:40.48]Mission accomplished.
[319:41.88]We knew we weren't alone in the galaxy.
[319:43.12]Trace of an extinct civilization.
[319:44.44]Hostile security drones in the rocks.
[319:47.06]It's obvious that we must continue our exploration of the galaxy and potentially prepare for hostilities.
[319:52.94]In order to do so, we'll need to set up colonies as bases of operation.
[319:56.80]Our scientists are already reverse engineering the interstellar drive to replicate its technology.
[320:01.55]We've also developed a SETI device for your ship.
[320:04.11]It will pick up signals of other sentient life in the galaxy indicated by radio signals over stars that you target.
[320:10.87]We need you at the helm of our space program.
[320:17.41]Expand the empire and get more wealth.
[320:19.65]Get some volunteers to be part of the crew.
[320:21.07]Okay.
[320:23.65]Cool.
[320:26.79]I'm on my own.
[320:27.79]Leave me alone.
[320:30.80]Stop calling me.
[320:35.94]Okay, how do I establish a colony?
[320:42.23]Excellent.
[320:42.53]Placing a colony is easy.
[320:44.39]After flying to planet Nemon, select the colony tool that has been added to your colonization tool bin and place the colony on land near a spice geyser.
[320:52.73]It'll instantly unpack, creating a colony.
[320:54.41]No assembly required.
[320:56.71]I want to make contact with the colony to make sure the citizens are packed in there.
[321:00.23]Unpacked safely.
[321:01.15]Okay.
[321:03.18]Goodbye.
[321:06.12]We're going to go to planet Nemon.
[321:12.93]He who controls the spice controls the universe.
[321:14.89]Alright.
[321:20.34]Where's... Thuja 2 system.
[321:25.80]Star map filters?
[321:26.92]My empire.
[321:28.74]Oh, okay.
[321:34.23]Okay.
[321:36.11]Missions.
[321:37.05]Right.
[321:38.51]Thuja 2.
[321:40.41]Zoom out all the way, baby.
[321:41.87]Alright.
[321:48.04]Holy shit.
[321:48.86]Well, I'm not seeing any of that.
[321:58.86]I gotta go to Neiman.
[321:59.66]Planets in green orbit paths are easier to terraform and colonize than planets on red or blue orbit paths.
[322:14.08]I have a question.
[322:15.38]Question for you.
[322:17.10]So Spore the game, they made a space simulation game and then added like a funny character creator onto the bottom of it.
[322:29.25]Is that how this worked?
[322:33.60]This feels like way more detailed than the rest of the entire game.
[322:42.21]Okay.
[322:43.45]There's Neemon.
[322:51.82]Base mode is a slog.
[322:53.14]This is 90% of the rest of the game.
[322:56.04]90% of the game from here on is the game.
[322:57.90]Does that mean that we did 10% of the game?
[323:05.00]Wow.
[323:07.76]Hmm.
[323:09.74]Colonies can be established on any planet from barren moons to lush terrasco or three oases.
[323:15.52]What?
[323:17.34]Fruitful colonies mine spice that can be traded.
[323:19.52]Nice.
[323:21.96]We plant a colony near the spice geysers.
[323:30.71]Let's get shot.
[323:45.29]Here we go.
[323:51.11]I used to want to play Spore so badly, but I only had the weird DS game.
[323:59.42]That's right.
[323:59.90]They did make a weird DS game, didn't they?
[324:03.90]I forgot about that completely.
[324:07.14]What?
[324:07.70]Hold on.
[324:09.69]I want to look this up.
[324:17.73]You just brought back a memory that I've buried for so long.
[324:21.89]Spore creatures, yeah.
[324:26.80]I do remember this.
[324:29.12]It was weird, too.
[324:30.12]Huh.
[324:34.66]You have your own empire.
[324:35.68]Cool.
[324:39.04]Oh, this is cool.
[324:39.49]We're in the endgame now, Peter.
[324:40.53]So, I mean, this is, like, cool.
[324:43.95]Report back to the homeworld.
[324:53.28]Report back to your home world for glory.
[324:54.84]Alright.
[324:55.12]I love running around doing spice trades.
[324:59.97]Yeah, this is cool.
[325:04.33]What if I go get some... I'm just going to go here.
[325:06.09]Why not?
[325:06.35]Let's go to Tantarok.
[325:11.64]Spore Hero Arena.
[325:18.67]This is cool.
[325:26.57]Cool.
[325:26.75]Alright.
[325:28.61]Dark Spore.
[325:29.15]Yeah, that was an ARPG, right?
[325:32.22]That one was cool.
[325:42.68]This was No Man's Sky a decade before No Man's Sky.
[325:45.56]That's true.
[325:48.66]Isn't No Man's Sky fun?
[325:53.48]You collected spice.
[325:54.54]It's a valued commodity.
[325:57.91]Cool.
[326:01.53]It depends.
[326:02.03]It's better now.
[326:02.67]Yeah, it's supposed to be fun now.
[326:04.43]I'll be counting on you to visit this colony frequently to collect spice from it.
[326:09.90]Oh, shit.
[326:10.18]You have to actually physically go there?
[326:14.01]Captain, we've intercepted transmissions that we believe are coming from other advanced beings in the galaxy.
[326:17.99]We need to investigate and attempt to establish first contact.
[326:20.65]Use the SETI tool equipped on your ship to help find them.
[326:24.53]Okay, let's go.
[326:29.27]We've been able to pinpoint the exact location of these transmissions, so you need to explore a bit.
[326:36.77]Hmm.
[326:38.57]Alright.
[326:41.31]Let's go.
[326:43.26]get the hell out of here find an alien empire find another space-faring empire and communicate with them you will know they are space-faring once you get close enough to their home star system establish contact with them using the short range video communicator alright alright let's go let's find them where are they
[327:23.69]oh they on fujitu oh shit that's your colony right right oh hold on over here I'm trying to hear the radio
[327:52.02]No.
[327:55.30]Radio?
[328:02.85]Radio means nothing.
[328:04.11]It's a visual.
[328:04.81]Oh, okay.
[328:13.20]Hmm.
[328:13.76]Nobody over here.
[328:15.62]Over two.
[328:20.72]Wait.
[328:21.96]I hear something.
[328:23.26]Somebody over there.
[328:26.63]Somebody here.
[328:27.05]Somebody's here.
[328:37.60]Craig's equation was right.
[328:38.48]A living alien race.
[328:39.44]We're not alone.
[328:40.04]Looks like they have sent an envoy to greet you.
[328:42.50]Talk to them.
[328:48.09]Welcome, welcome.
[328:48.79]Always a pleasure.
[328:49.65]Pleasure to meet another friend.
[328:51.23]Provided you are a friend, of course.
[328:53.53]Give us your name.
[328:56.65]I am from the Jermamite.
[328:58.43]I come in peace.
[328:59.71]Behold, I am from the great and mighty planet Zirkan.
[329:02.91]Call off your fighter before I blast it into pieces.
[329:04.81]Behold, I am from the great and mighty planet of Zirkan.
[329:12.31]We agree that you are absolutely tremendous.
[329:14.87]Will you spend money now?
[329:16.23]What?
[329:19.25]I'm not as small as you think, but let's continue.
[329:21.89]Yes, yes.
[329:22.41]Happy to help.
[329:22.97]Happy to help.
[329:23.47]What can we do for you?
[329:24.29]Can I get my ship repaired, please?
[329:28.37]And my ship recharged, please?
[329:29.75]And let's trade.
[329:32.29]Oh, okay.
[329:33.21]I've got some red spices.
[329:34.79]What do you think about that?
[329:42.45]You're way too happy with that.
[329:46.59]That's like
[329:48.28]you have four aces in your hand at the poker table um is it am I getting am I getting scammed diplomacy I'd like to know about your race please accept a gift so we can be friends I'd like to establish a trade route tell me more about your race
[330:13.39]Thanks to the philosophy of prosperity, we, the Kurgle Empire, love everything.
[330:17.98]We love our empire.
[330:18.90]We love other empires.
[330:20.90]We love happy people.
[330:22.42]We love unhappy people.
[330:24.26]But most of all, we love our profit margins, and we love all the other things because they contribute to our margins.
[330:30.67]Okay.
[330:35.35]You want to work with us?
[330:36.05]We offer rewards equivalent to many important professions, such as dock worker and dishwasher.
[330:40.21]I need a quest.
[330:43.55]So, good of you and your statue to visit one as insignificant as us.
[330:47.85]If it wouldn't be too much trouble, we have a favor.
[330:50.40]Go to Travel to Planet Tibonorrar and see what opportunities might await, only if it would not be too much trouble.
[330:58.10]Okay?
[331:00.90]Commanding a spacecraft is only half the responsibilities of a space captain.
[331:04.79]The other half requires planetside tactical skills, where you and your crew will need to leave your spaceship and beam down to planets.
[331:11.91]Okay, you have to beam down like Star Trek?
[331:17.30]Let's go!
[331:19.70]Once you get to Tibonorar, you will need to beam down to the planet.
[331:26.54]Cool!
[331:28.68]That sounds like fun.
[331:29.36]Visit Vatigo on Tiboronar.
[331:35.26]Return to the homeworld.
[331:38.30]Okay.
[331:41.64]The allies and enemies filter will show you the regions of space controlled by friend or foe.
[331:45.74]The empire filter will show all stars occupied by alien races.
[331:50.74]I do have the space DLC.
[331:52.62]I got it for the parts, mainly.
[331:56.69]Alright, return to the homeworld.
[331:57.73]Can I not go there?
[332:07.65]It's too far.
[332:18.67]How do you compare pointer addresses in C++ using the module's operator, Jerva?
[332:22.43]You could put a briefcase on the table right now with a million dollars in cash in it, and I would not tell you how.
[332:28.40]I would not have any idea.
[332:35.82]The download from your data recorder is quite amazing, Captain.
[332:37.78]We had no idea other space-faring civilizations were so close by.
[332:40.55]Ooh, we are going to establish our place in the galactic community.
[332:48.22]Ooh, I'm in.
[332:51.00]We produce spice in record amounts, resulting in surplus.
[332:53.41]We need to look for potential buyers.
[332:55.63]Alright.
[332:57.15]I get it.
[332:57.47]That sounds pretty lucrative.
[333:02.63]Trade partners.
[333:04.29]Let's go.
[333:04.69]Make a deal.
[333:05.07]Alright.
[333:06.85]Visit Vatigo.
[333:15.42]On planet...
[333:17.88]Tibonarrar.
[333:18.80]Okay.
[333:24.08]On planet Tiborinar.
[333:26.63]Am I going?
[333:31.03]Where am I?
[333:37.73]This is Bulbur 2.
[333:38.57]I need to visit Vat Tego in Tiborinar.
[333:44.24]Where is it?
[334:03.53]It's the flag.
[334:04.23]There it is.
[334:08.01]At Tigo.
[334:21.13]At Adventurers.
[334:22.59]Oh, my God.
[334:25.01]Um... I'm...
[334:34.82]Okay, cool.
[334:42.24]Uh, energy meter tracks how much energy some of the abilities use and how much is stored and recharged by batteries.
[334:46.86]Cool.
[334:47.14]Um, alright.
[334:50.18]Cool.
[335:13.21]You good?
[335:13.45]Sounds like you're having a panic attack.
[335:14.85]What?
[335:17.33]Why?
[335:33.93]Somehow these look worse.
[336:08.24]Hmm.
[336:09.78]Box cock?
[336:10.36]Something like that.
[336:23.85]This looks horrible, but whatever.
[336:27.93]Cock streamer talk.
[336:28.71]Oh, sorry.
[336:29.15]Yeah, yeah.
[336:31.14]It's the end of the stream voice, by the way.
[336:33.34]Yeah, we're at the end of the stream voice.
[336:34.54]I'm listening to me.
[336:39.48]Did you add weapons?
[336:48.29]Yep, 100% end of the stream voice.
[336:50.85]Shit.
[336:54.17]I don't have any weapons though.
[337:00.62]He's losing it.
[337:01.26]No, I'm good.
[337:01.78]I'm good.
[337:02.06]I'm good.
[337:09.65]I don't have any.
[337:10.19]Do I need weapons?
[337:10.99]I thought this is a diplomatic mission.
[337:18.64]Imagine there's a conflict going on and this beams down.
[337:23.24]And dabs.
[337:28.44]You're captain will gain experience once you've completed this adventure.
[337:35.56]Okay, let's take a look.
[337:37.92]You get batteries and generators.
[337:39.24]There's the map.
[337:42.62]There's a progress bar.
[337:43.54]Can I talk?
[337:55.43]Is this GTA music?
[337:58.12]It is.
[338:04.54]But you still sing?
[338:05.92]I mean the quartermaster.
[338:24.70]That's R2D2.
[338:24.98]Come here.
[338:27.52]Come here.
[338:31.34]Come here.
[338:31.64]Come here.
[338:31.88]Come here.
[338:32.14]Come here, guy.
[338:34.53]Robot shall rule the Earth.
[338:35.64]I already drop kicked this thing.
[338:45.44]I feel like I'm playing an MMO right now.
[338:49.10]I feel like I'm playing the City of Heroes.
[339:00.85]Big low just arrived.
[339:03.07]And why can I save it?
[339:05.97]Talk to the head bot.
[339:06.95]Alright.
[339:14.65]Spaceport Authority and its peer servant welcomes you, Captain.
[339:18.02]If you're looking to become a great space captain, you've come to the right place.
[339:22.86]Feel free to have a look around and introduce yourself to the local lifeforms.
[339:26.73]If you're left, the merchant will notify you of his latest merchandise and how to take possession of them.
[339:32.42]Behind me, the space traveler will inform you of the interstellar customs for obtaining new assignments.
[339:37.42]This is way more detailed than all the other ones combined.
[339:39.58]There's crew members on the right.
[339:42.98]Okay.
[339:43.88]Alright.
[339:44.98]How can I save it?
[339:45.58]Can I dance still?
[339:53.25]This is all DLC.
[339:58.97]Oh.
[340:02.41]I love this music.
[340:03.37]Okay.
[340:06.59]Making allies with other empires will add them to your fleet and you can beam down.
[340:14.14]Cool.
[340:14.48]Cool.
[340:14.68]How do I dance?
[340:15.70]Let's dance!
[340:40.03]You got moves like that?
[340:40.85]Awful.
[340:48.85]Truly awful.
[340:59.92]Still can't pose.
[341:00.94]No, I can't.
[341:02.70]Hello, I am the guy that sells stuff.
[341:12.80]Need crew members?
[341:13.66]They're over here.
[341:14.96]You want batteries?
[341:20.98]I can sell you batteries.
[341:29.31]This is you just completed a mission in GTA 3.
[341:37.71]Plus respect.
[341:46.05]Wow, you do look cool.
[341:49.13]You look really cool.
[341:50.55]Gotta take on adventuring missions and shit.
[341:54.87]Cool.
[341:55.97]I just want to save the game.
[342:12.27]OK, goodbye.
[342:12.87]There's another one of these.
[342:33.19]Look at this screen.
[342:36.55]Um?
[342:38.17]Oh geez.
[342:42.66]Energy slash.
[342:48.20]I want to go back down there.
[342:56.69]I want to beam beat back down here.
[342:59.23]Holy shit, after five hours, I thought he didn't like this game.
[343:08.21]Wait, what?
[343:10.29]Oh, you must have came in here when I was defending myself as an E-clon.
[343:17.88]Imagine listening to that conversation.
[343:23.61]No, I'm not a video game streamer.
[343:25.17]I'm an e-clown.
[343:26.79]Okay?
[343:27.11]I don't stream video games.
[343:28.35]I mean, I play them, but I'm a clown.
[343:29.93]I'm an e-clown.
[343:30.87]I don't care.
[343:31.49]I have to be in full makeup on the phone, I think.
[343:38.23]Full clown makeup with a controller in my hand, like a GameCube controller and a cigarette in my mouth.
[343:46.44]I'm trying to keep up with all this shit that all these kids like these days.
[344:12.18]I'm just smushing my face in his ass.
[344:20.94]Goodbye.
[344:22.08]I'm done.
[344:22.88]I'll see you later.
[344:24.42]I'll see you later.
[344:30.06]It's music.
[344:43.41]I saved it right before that.
[344:45.41]Sunday stream, please.
[344:46.45]Sunday stream, please.
[344:47.39]I'm sorry.
[344:48.41]You're going to be very disappointed.
[344:49.31]There's no Sunday stream.
[344:52.81]And it's not even a Monday stream.
[344:56.72]There is a Tuesday stream.
[344:58.62]There is a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday stream.
[345:02.02]Ow.
[345:07.92]I'll be back on Tuesday.
[345:09.96]Right.
[345:10.18]But today's Saturday, right?
[345:11.20]Sunday.
[345:11.50]Yeah, I'll be back on Tuesday.
[345:15.63]I'm going to try to get Pikmin 2 ready.
[345:18.67]That's the plan.
[345:20.45]I can't take this anymore.
[345:21.79]I've got to get out of this.
[345:24.61]Oh, wrong thing.
[345:28.99]I'm going to try to play Pikmin 2 on... Oh, that's really good.
[345:34.43]It's from that painting game, Such Art.
[345:39.75]Just retire if you hate us so much.
[345:44.83]Oh, what the hell?
[345:48.97]Oh, look at that.
[345:49.67]It's the bear.
[345:50.77]Back to back.
[345:51.35]Cool.
[345:52.21]We've seen a couple of those.
[345:55.61]If for some reason I do not play Pikmin on Tuesday, I'll play it on Wednesday or Thursday.
[346:00.90]But the plan is to try to get Pikmin ready.
[346:03.26]Try to have everything set up and play Pikmin 2.
[346:06.52]If it's not Pikmin 2 on Tuesday, then it'll be a mystery game.
[346:10.62]And then we'll play and hopefully beat Pikmin 2 next week.
[346:18.23]Play Nintendo Land by yourself.
[346:20.62]What?
[346:31.98]Will you beat Spore?
[346:34.46]Uh, no.
[346:36.38]This is probably the last time you're going to see Spore.
[346:41.07]It was very fun.
[346:42.51]I heavily enjoyed my time, except for about, except for the, for the part of, it was like a 10 minute portion of the civilization phase.
[346:52.38]I had to skip it because I didn't like it and I wanted to get out of there.
[346:56.83]What would you give Spore for a rating?
[346:58.43]89.
[346:58.45]Nope. 87.
[347:12.05]Too much water.
[347:13.61]It's not an 87.
[347:14.09]It's on it realistically.
[347:16.53]Okay, the creature part, the creature creator is like a 95.
[347:22.29]The video game of Spore is like a 4.
[347:27.47]If I have to be totally honest.
[347:35.20]But like the creature stuff is, I would say even like 98.
[347:41.44]When that first came out, that was such a big deal.
[347:44.12]But like the video game portion of it is like a 4.8 for like the video game portion.
[347:54.21]So you average those two together.
[347:55.55]No, no, no, that's not 4.
[347:56.17]Let's say 6.
[347:56.43]A 9.8 and a 6 together is an 8.7.
[348:03.61]There's important bits about Thousand Year Door.
[348:05.51]There is?
[348:05.77]What do you mean?
[348:09.04]Let me look at... Okay, here's some bits.
[348:11.36]Jerma, film yourself eating an entire jar of olives now.
[348:14.08]That's not Thousand Year Door?
[348:18.00]Chat, don't tell him.
[348:20.30]Just take your time and have fun, Jerma.
[348:21.56]You don't need to rush.
[348:27.61]Your brain is bad, Jerma.
[348:31.25]I think you want the game's journalist difficulty.
[348:37.17]I don't see anything about Thousand Year Door.
[348:46.62]That was like my favorite part of the whole night.
[348:55.60]If you want to play Thousand Year Door, please play the way you want, not the way others people say to do it.
[349:06.06]I've been told that I'm gonna get heavily backseated in Thousand Year Door.
[349:12.32]I'm ready for it.
[349:13.96]Whenever we play it.
[349:16.82]As a bug for the original Thousand Year Door game, it's very important that before you start playing, you take a stinky... whatever.
[349:22.73]Remember, was the Spore City level also filled with concrete?
[349:36.93]I don't know.
[349:38.37]I thought that was a photo of me for a second.
[349:42.53]Alright, I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[349:45.51]If it's not Pikmin 2, then it'll be something else.
[349:48.12]Expect Pikmin 2 within the next two or three streams.
[349:52.44]That was Spore.
[349:53.00]It was a lot of fun.
[349:55.00]Thanks for watching as always, everybody.
[350:02.53]Thanks for hanging out for as long as you have.
[350:05.93]It is getting late Eastern time, so I know a lot of people are getting tired.
[350:11.42]Let me get to the credits.
[350:23.18]A little bit more art.
[350:25.52]Here's all the subs from today.
[350:26.58]Three subs, gifted subs, everything.
[350:29.94]Thanks a lot as always, everybody.
[350:35.00]Let them roll.
[350:39.32]You inspired me to reinstall Spore and play it again.
[350:41.30]I mean, I joke about a lot of the shit in there.
[350:45.58]You guys know it's just jokes, right?
[350:51.16]It doesn't deserve a 4.
[350:52.68]I mean, it does, but it doesn't.
[350:55.39]Credits are fucked up, I know.
[351:09.43]I know.
[351:09.65]Hold on.
[351:09.81]I'm going to try it.
[351:10.57]Can I grab it?
[351:12.17]Hey, I fixed it.
[351:21.72]They literally give me a copy of Thousand Year Door if you need it.
[351:24.77]I will not take it.
[351:27.75]I appreciate it, though.
[351:29.71]I do not.
[351:30.67]I will not.
[351:31.13]I do not accept anything from anyone.
[351:34.09]So just to let you know for the future.
[351:42.81]What about two copies?
[351:45.09]Except for money.
[351:45.95]I mean, you got, you got me.
[351:58.93]You got, what am I gonna, I don't have, I have nothing to say.
[352:00.53]You got me there.
[352:03.11]But money also doesn't, I mean, look, the systems in place for Twitch for you to send bits or subscribe is not, I have to, we have to correspond and you have to send me mail.
[352:14.22]Take the money.
[352:22.97]He just wants money.
[352:27.90]Alright, see you guys on Tuesday.
[352:29.14]Uh, we should raid.
[352:30.30]Yeah, we'll raid again.
[352:31.14]Where are we gonna go?
[352:32.42]Where should we go?
[352:34.61]We're streaming right now.
[352:36.57]I'm trying to... I'm trying to remember who... Who have we not raided in a while?
[352:42.95]Or maybe somebody new.
[352:44.91]Somebody new.
[352:46.81]You know what I mean?
[352:50.01]I feel like we just... I feel like we just run around in a circle on this channel.
[352:53.84]Somebody new.
[353:22.81]Gus, Gus, Gus, Gus Johnson.
[353:24.44]Oh, Gus.
[353:25.04]Wait, Gus Johnson is streaming.
[353:27.10]Hold on.
[353:28.58]Oh, shit.
[353:32.24]Oh, he's fucking hilarious.
[353:33.12]Yeah, let's go to Gus Johnson.
[353:36.32]I've seen a bunch of his videos.
[353:38.96]Yeah, let's go.
[353:49.26]Make sure I spell the name correctly.
[353:50.70]Uh, Gus Johnson.
[353:56.56]Gus Johnson.
[353:57.26]Yeah, go say hello.
[353:59.50]Go raid.
[354:04.35]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[354:05.31]Have fun.
[354:11.75]I didn't even know you knew who he was.
[354:14.33]He's got some very popular videos that have made the rounds a few times.
[354:17.65]I don't know personally, but I've seen a couple of the videos.
[354:22.57]Go say hello.
[354:31.33]Good night.
[354:32.23]Goodbye.
[354:33.49]Take care.
[354:46.83]Okay.
