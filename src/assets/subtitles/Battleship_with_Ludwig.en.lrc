[00:06.72]Welcome.
[00:09.92]The next big thing on Twitch.
[00:13.88]What's up, everybody?
[00:14.34]How you doing?
[00:23.65]Lagging?
[00:24.51]Sometimes when I... I don't know why.
[00:26.77]Sometimes when I start my stream... I... It, like, crashes.
[00:32.92]I'm going to figure out why it's doing that.
[00:36.50]Hmm.
[00:40.03]Why did I crash?
[00:42.99]Yeah, this happened last time.
[00:49.86]I'm live, right?
[00:50.42]Yeah, the stream crashes.
[00:53.06]That's really weird.
[00:53.64]I don't know why that happens.
[00:55.48]Well, I think I'm back.
[01:00.30]I have to, like, reinstall something.
[01:01.60]Alright.
[01:02.30]I can't see the chat, though.
[01:03.16]Hold on.
[01:03.42]Let me see if I can refresh it.
[01:06.98]That was a little bizarre.

[01:34.61]If he doesn't even know who that is.
[01:38.08]Let me see how, let me, I gotta pop my chat back out.
[01:40.62]Why does my shit crash?
[01:41.92]What happened?
[01:42.52]I got a new computer.
[01:43.36]Maybe that's why.
[01:44.84]I gotta pop out this chat, hold on.
[01:49.33]Sorry, technical difficulties already.
[01:51.49]There we are.
[01:54.97]Okay.
[02:00.43]millionaire pc I don't know what it is I don't know why he's doing it you know it's only for the first like five seconds that I'm like flooding my computer's dns right I don't even know what that means billionaire berry no I hope you guys are doing well uh I'm very excited for today
[02:25.18]I think this is going to be the best stream of the year.
[02:28.20]Fuck, I shouldn't have said that.
[02:29.08]But like, you know what I mean?
[02:29.80]I'm just fucking around.
[02:30.48]I mean, you know.
[02:33.98]Let's go ahead.

[02:41.53]Go ahead.
[02:41.79]My stream crashed.
[02:42.83]I don't know if you saw that.
[02:46.55]Yeah, stream crashed.
[02:47.59]But I got it back.
[02:48.43]We're back.
[02:49.05]We're good.
[02:50.15]Oh, you're back?
[02:50.61]Everyone's there?
[02:51.15]Everyone's happy?
[02:51.67]Yeah.
[02:52.77]Dude, my stream just crashes.
[02:54.09]I don't know why.
[02:54.57]Like, I turn on OBS and my computer freezes.
[02:57.91]Oh, wait.
[02:58.73]Is it... Are you adjusting OBS when that happens?
[03:02.35]Um... No, like, I'll just... I hit go live and, like, I drop a ton of frames.
[03:07.92]Oh, shit.
[03:08.24]Did my computer crash?
[03:10.46]I think you might have... Um...
[03:14.74]What is it called?
[03:15.72]Why is CCleaner running?
[03:16.98]I think you have SCD, bro.
[03:20.66]Why is CCleaner running?
[03:22.46]You got shitty computer disorder over there.
[03:25.04]You need a better... I need to get you hooked up with like a better computer.
[03:30.54]Your computer should not do that.
[03:32.02]I have a great computer though.
[03:33.22]I just got like a new awesome computer with an extremely overpriced paid like 30% premium 3090 in it.
[03:39.57]You have a 3090?
[03:40.43]Yeah, dude.
[03:41.17]I paid like it was... For a battleship?
[03:45.01]Yeah, but I played other stuff besides... You know what?
[03:49.69]This is not a fucking good spending of money of me at my part.
[03:52.35]Not at all.
[03:53.47]Yeah, I played Resident Evil 8.
[03:55.03]It's the only game I played that has 3D graphics.
[03:57.85]You should, like, be mining Bitcoin while you're alive or something with that card.
[04:01.71]You're wasting that.
[04:02.57]Dude, are you ready for Battleship?
[04:05.96]You ready to do this?
[04:07.22]I am ready for Battleship.
[04:09.00]I have a bit of mutiny on my side already.
[04:10.84]Everyone's on Team Jerma in my chat, which is concerning.
[04:13.36]Oh, really?
[04:14.60]Are we in the same game?
[04:15.64]Did my internet crash?
[04:16.98]No, it crashed.
[04:18.46]You're gone.
[04:19.30]Oh, okay.
[04:20.04]Here, I'll make a new room.
[04:21.87]That's alright, though.
[04:24.38]Yeah, I don't know what's going on.
[04:25.46]30-90 for Battleship.
[04:26.20]Well, it's not like you'll play Battleship a lot, at least.
[04:29.85]I mean, you tell me.
[04:31.95]This is potentially a pretty big deal, from what I hear.
[04:36.61]Sorry, what's a big deal?
[04:39.03]Battleship could be really fun to play with people on stream, like with friends.
[04:44.00]Yeah, it'd be fun for a bit for sure.
[04:45.58]Yeah, of course.
[04:46.26]That's what we're doing right now.
[04:47.11]That's like why we're hanging out and playing.
[04:49.89]Yeah, Battleship is definitely fun for a little bit.
[04:51.83]Yeah, I agree with you.
[04:52.39]It'd be good.
[04:53.61]We'll have a good hour for it.
[04:55.13]Hour?
[04:56.69]For two?
[04:57.11]Yeah, maybe.
[04:57.63]I was assuming like six.
[05:00.79]I got a friend code for you, but I'm just going to say it.
[05:03.45]Should I just type it?
[05:04.09]I'll type it to you.
[05:05.19]You could say it really fast and then I could try to join.
[05:07.44]No, I don't think I want to do that.
[05:10.70]I'm typing it to you in Discord.
[05:12.92]Perfect.
[05:14.56]Come on in.
[05:19.12]There you are.
[05:19.50]Alright, so does it show the room code anywhere, or can I go over to the actual stream?
[05:23.75]I don't see it anywhere, but I don't think there's another way for someone to join Battleship.
[05:28.39]I don't think so.
[05:29.09]Alright, I think we're good.
[05:29.81]Just two.
[05:32.45]Alright, so those of you who don't understand how Battleship is played, very, very complicated game.
[05:38.04]What you do is you get five ships, you place them around, and then each turn, back and forth, Ludwig and I are going to try to kill each other.
[05:45.66]Sink our ships.
[05:47.91]I'm sorry, are you explaining battleship?
[05:50.35]Yeah.
[05:51.37]That makes sense.
[05:53.07]No bets already?
[05:55.67]Oh!
[05:56.89]Are you a bit of a gambling man?
[05:58.12]Let me just snap the camera off.
[06:02.37]uh yeah alright but no we haven't even played one game though you want to do this already you want to bet all what do you want to bet what we'll start let's just start off like casually just like with a casual you know let's just say five gifted you know just a casual breezy five gifted subsidy the person's channel just to the other person's channel or or better yet I thought you're gonna say like 500 bucks I was like holy shit we're like already going
[06:30.36]No, we'll start.
[06:31.04]I mean, it's the first match, you know?
[06:32.62]How about this?
[06:34.94]I imagine you're not tier three sub to me.
[06:36.80]Is that right?
[06:37.54]That's incorrect.
[06:39.27]I'm not tier sub to you.
[06:40.37]Tier three.
[06:41.55]Okay.
[06:42.25]I'm not tier three sub to you.
[06:43.57]The loser tier three subs to the winner for just a month.
[06:47.03]Alright.
[06:47.23]That works.
[06:48.05]Game one.
[06:48.43]Let's go.
[06:49.85]Do you have any experience playing this?
[06:51.95]Well, let me tell you, I'm using Frederic Poitier, which try to click on him right now on your stream.
[06:58.74]You bought this guy?
[07:00.68]I spent money on this.
[07:02.28]Why did you buy this?
[07:04.44]It was $3.
[07:06.26]It just changes nothing.
[07:08.12]You're never going to open this game ever again.
[07:09.98]Yeah, this is... No, no, no.
[07:13.28]Yes, you are.
[07:13.90]Because this is a big deal coming on Twitch soon.
[07:17.76]What?
[07:18.82]I'm sorry.
[07:19.22]What do you mean it's a big deal coming on Twitch?
[07:20.82]You're going to be playing this all the time, I think.
[07:24.74]Like Battleship?
[07:25.72]Yeah.
[07:28.54]Why are people spamming new meta in my chat?
[07:30.46]Alright, you ready?
[07:33.16]Tier 3 sub to the other person?
[07:35.20]Tier 3 sub to the other person.
[07:37.68]Let's go.
[07:39.74]Oh, just press cancel.
[07:42.92]Alright, so we don't tell each other where we're going, right?
[07:45.37]Well, no, you're supposed to say the smallest ship where you put it.
[07:48.69]Wait, you have to say the smallest ship where you put it?
[07:50.77]Yeah, you have to tell me where you put your smallest ship.
[07:52.77]Okay, smallest ship is going bottom right.
[07:56.74]Yeah, mine's also going the bottom right.
[07:57.90]Okay.
[07:59.00]Can we rotate?
[08:00.32]Oh, okay.
[08:12.81]Yeah.
[08:13.43]Good luck.
[08:14.55]Oh.
[08:21.67]No, don't cheat.
[08:22.31]Don't look at anybody's screen.
[08:23.85]No, of course not.
[08:24.43]Of course not.
[08:27.15]I'm not looking at any screens and I have my chat just firmly out of my grip.
[08:32.50]I'm ready.
[08:33.32]You ready?
[08:34.74]I'm prepared, yeah.
[08:36.10]Who goes first?
[08:36.50]I don't even know who that is.
[08:38.64]I called heads in the air.
[08:39.96]Oh, dammit.
[08:40.38]Alright, here we go.
[08:41.98]Okay.
[08:46.55]You lied!
[08:47.51]Wait, did you say bottom right?
[08:50.07]I did say bottom right.
[08:51.39]Welcome to war.
[08:53.51]So did I. You lied to me.
[08:58.88]More hurtful when you do it.
[09:00.52]Here's how I know that this is going to be correct.
[09:04.08]He went up one square.
[09:06.72]Fuck with me.
[09:07.18]No, he didn't.
[09:07.64]Whatever.
[09:08.96]Ah, maybe you're saying he went up one square because that's what you did.
[09:16.08]A mirror match.
[09:16.92]He went up three squares.
[09:17.74]No, he didn't.
[09:22.47]You're trying to fool me here.
[09:23.49]You did not go up a square at all.
[09:24.73]You went left a square.
[09:28.26]So how do you win?
[09:29.48]By sinking everything, right?
[09:30.91]You gotta sink my destroyer, my battleship, my star command.
[09:35.01]You gotta sink everything.
[09:36.29]Alright, this is for a tier 3 sub, right?
[09:38.05]I don't want to fuck around anymore.
[09:39.71]This is a tier 3.
[09:40.25]This is $25, yeah.
[09:45.41]Come on, you don't do this like a puzzle?
[09:48.12]Where you do the edges first, and then you go in the middle when you're ready?
[09:53.21]It's a children's game.
[09:54.17]You just click a random square and then occasionally you hit.
[09:56.85]I mean, honestly, you'll probably do as well if you just don't even know what you're doing.
[10:02.48]If you do it blind, if you get like a monkey to do it, you probably have more success.
[10:06.98]I mean, you thought I was in like the edges there.
[10:09.82]I thought you were a corner Karen, yeah.
[10:13.38]Oh, what do you think?
[10:13.90]I'm crazy?
[10:14.88]You do the thing where you put all your ships in one corner?
[10:16.87]That's how you instantly lose this game.
[10:19.27]I know that at least.
[10:22.39]You got one?
[10:23.79]Yeah, I went for the corner.
[10:27.78]Apparently, you're a bit of a corner Karen.
[10:29.71]Wait, you get to go twice?
[10:30.79]What's this bullshit?
[10:32.27]You go until you miss.
[10:33.81]What?
[10:34.81]There's no way, right?
[10:36.71]No, I hated that shit.
[10:37.43]When I used to play basketball with people, one-on-one, it would be like, oh, you go until you don't, and whoever scored gets the ball back, and I never got the ball back.
[10:43.58]They just scored like 20 times in a row.
[10:45.70]Yeah, winner stays is kind of hard, but fortunately for you, it's not like shooting a jump shot here.
[10:53.36]I'm still shooting in the dark.
[10:55.85]You're working your way up towards E10.
[10:57.89]I'm a little nervous about my E10 strategy.
[11:01.13]E10.
[11:03.88]Eating this dick.
[11:05.68]What?
[11:08.74]Sounds like eating.
[11:12.22]Well, it's alright.
[11:12.70]You get one.
[11:15.15]Oh, yeah.
[11:16.09]You thought I was doing the thing.
[11:17.47]Yeah.
[11:18.17]It was worth it.
[11:18.75]Yeah, I think you're in the same place.
[11:21.49]Now, the thing about me is I'll never click where I am.
[11:28.36]You're such a corner care.
[11:30.38]No, I'm not.
[11:31.50]You just happen to get the one.
[11:32.60]The one that's over there.
[11:38.89]Oh, God.
[11:40.23]This is your destroyer?
[11:43.27]Oh, no.
[11:46.17]Alright.
[11:47.35]Oh, wait!
[11:48.71]Jerma, no!
[11:51.11]No, you didn't!
[11:54.41]Jerma, it's a tier three!
[11:57.79]It's hard.
[11:58.37]You got one more, a sneaky one that you're not gonna find.
[12:00.75]Yeah.
[12:01.71]Yeah, maybe that last ship will save your day.
[12:05.53]I have a feeling you put every ship in the bottom left, except for your small one, which you put in the top right.
[12:12.07]Yeah, but that would be a stupid strategy that you'd lose every time.
[12:17.95]Alright, I gotta get you.
[12:21.94]It's a bit of a stupid strategy.
[12:23.22]I wouldn't recommend that.
[12:24.36]Yeah, well, at least it wasn't for $2,500.
[12:26.30]It was for $25.
[12:27.36]Are we getting there?
[12:29.58]We'll get there.
[12:30.64]Oh, no.
[12:31.14]Bingo.
[12:34.75]Oh.
[12:35.31]Oh, no.
[12:35.91]Excuse me.
[12:36.63]Somebody's right here in the middle.
[12:38.83]Yeah, I went for a little, you know...
[12:42.02]Oh.
[12:42.30]A little middle play.
[12:43.22]Okay.
[12:43.66]Alright.
[12:43.94]That's good for me.
[12:45.30]This bottom left strategy.
[12:47.20]Would you have been so foolish?
[12:49.56]No.
[12:53.12]Everyone's calling you a middle Manny.
[12:54.57]Yeah, because you got stuff in the middle.
[12:56.69]I got a couple of things in the middle.
[12:58.23]I wouldn't focus on it too much.
[13:02.21]What is down here?
[13:03.21]Oh, that was your four.
[13:04.61]That was your four ship.
[13:06.15]Yeah.
[13:06.63]It was my French four.
[13:08.50]I don't know the names of the ships.
[13:09.96]I just know how many numbers there are.
[13:12.63]Okay.
[13:13.11]So... I think you did... I think you... Are you not as dumb as I am?
[13:21.35]Did you not put anything right next to each other?
[13:23.53]No.
[13:24.81]I played this smart.
[13:25.76]I played this by the book.
[13:27.00]I made a... The thing about me is, you know... I come up with strategies.
[13:32.72]I know.
[13:33.24]You're a chess player, right?
[13:35.08]Yeah.
[13:35.46]I'm a chess player by trade, so... Oh!
[13:39.29]Found you!
[13:41.45]Which way are you?
[13:42.29]I think this is your little guy.
[13:43.37]Thank you.
[13:45.45]Nope.
[13:49.43]Phenomenal guess.
[13:51.05]Where did you hide this last one?
[13:52.55]This is a bit devious.
[13:55.69]It's a four, right?
[13:58.48]Yeah.
[13:58.74]There's a bit of strategy involved here.
[14:03.18]All I need to go is from this point diagonally upwards, and then I'll eliminate every single place.
[14:10.84]Ooh, close.
[14:12.49]Very close.
[14:14.51]I don't trust you.
[14:19.29]It's a war of attrition right now.
[14:21.27]You know what I mean?
[14:22.99]You got to spend a million years finding this last one.
[14:26.47]Well, I have my tugboat hidden pretty well.
[14:29.95]I only need to get one ship.
[14:33.35]Alright.
[14:38.12]Let's eliminate this.
[14:43.96]Everyone's screaming, why?
[14:45.06]What do you mean, why?
[14:46.02]There's two ways it can go, up or down.
[14:51.31]Oh, this is where your big guy is, right here.
[14:53.45]You did find my big guy.
[14:56.61]That's the easiest one to find, though, mathematically.
[14:59.39]That's true.
[15:00.62]You won't find another ship for years.
[15:04.46]Well, you did put him right next to you.
[15:05.62]You did the same thing I did, didn't you?
[15:07.54]Well, I had a gap.
[15:08.80]Yeah, but you saying there's a gap means that there's definitely another ship right here.
[15:12.92]Yeah, you did the same thing I did!
[15:15.45]You did the same thing I did!
[15:17.37]We have the same board!
[15:18.39]What?
[15:18.95]What the f- What?
[15:20.87]This is really bad!
[15:22.43]This is really bad for me!
[15:24.39]No, no, it's not!
[15:25.59]This is really bad!
[15:27.39]This is really bad!
[15:28.53]What are you- what are you- wait, did you do the same- What?
[15:35.36]How do you have two ships that are this big?
[15:36.96]You have two destroyers?
[15:42.24]I'm so confused.
[15:43.18]I was just... You just gotta keep shooting your shots, Captain.
[15:49.76]Oh, wait a minute.
[15:50.60]Oh, wait.
[15:51.16]They're all connected.
[15:54.66]Oh, boy.
[15:55.30]You're in deep shit.
[15:57.90]Oh, no.
[15:58.88]Well, I actually have one last trick up my sleeve.
[16:01.64]Yeah.
[16:02.48]And I think I know where it is.
[16:03.42]Because it's probably exactly where I put mine.
[16:08.80]You did the same thing, man.
[16:10.12]That's so funny.
[16:12.30]Which way?
[16:12.70]How many are left?
[16:13.91]Is it one or two?
[16:15.47]There's only one three ship left, and it's either left or right here.
[16:20.05]And I don't know, did you, did you, are you as compulsive enough?
[16:23.85]Oh, listen to that voice.
[16:26.69]I'm getting a little... Were you as compulsive enough to make sure you created the full Tetris line?
[16:32.42]Right?
[16:32.62]Like it has to be perfect.
[16:34.28]Or did you have... That's a good point.
[16:36.80]It is.
[16:37.20]Of course it is.
[16:37.98]That's such a good point.
[16:39.74]Where was yours?
[16:44.59]That's it.
[16:46.37]Oh, you're devious.
[16:49.34]You won.
[16:49.88]I won the game.
[16:51.96]Yeah, the greatest comeback of all time.
[16:54.94]But you did the same thing that I did.
[16:56.44]And I thought that you were so much smarter than me.
[16:59.34]That was what I was hoping.
[17:00.36]That's what I coast off of in my life is that people think I'm smarter than I am.
[17:03.58]And then I'm not.
[17:04.24]I was hoping I would get there.
[17:06.75]Alright.
[17:07.11]Well, tier three sub.
[17:09.47]It's a tier three sub.
[17:10.39]It's a tier three sub to you.
[17:12.33]I'm sending it over.
[17:16.41]There goes my tier two.
[17:17.55]Here's where I'm kind of concerned about this.
[17:21.24]So I'm assuming we're probably exponentially going to increase this number.
[17:25.57]Oh.
[17:26.15]Did I really just blow it in the first round?
[17:28.23]Like, oh, I won.
[17:29.07]I won the first round.
[17:31.71]You're saying that you won the lowest stakes game.
[17:34.97]Yeah, so when we get to like, oh yeah, we're going to do this for $5,000, which I hope we don't do that because I don't know if I have that.
[17:41.49]But, you know, I don't win that one.
[17:43.97]I leave the Battleship Casino with $4,995 in the hole, whatever it is.
[17:45.92]That's exactly what's going to happen, yeah, to a T.
[17:56.93]Alright, you ready for the next one?
[17:57.95]That was a good warm-up.
[17:58.97]I'm trying to subscribe.
[18:00.62]I've found out that I can't now, I think.
[18:06.12]I think someone gifted me a Tier 3.
[18:08.66]Wait, what?
[18:10.70]My debt's been paid.
[18:11.90]I'm going to gift a Tier 3 back.
[18:14.09]Gift a Tier 3?
[18:15.03]Yeah, because I've been Tier... Someone got there before I could get there.
[18:20.19]That's so funny.
[18:22.13]Alright, let me make sure the room code's not here.
[18:26.80]I imagine if we just hit rematch, it should be... Okay.
[18:32.32]Somebody just invited me to a game, but I've never heard of this name.
[18:35.96]Uh, is this a dumb question?
[18:37.91]Do you only have one scene on your Twitch OBS?
[18:41.65]Well, this is... I have multiple scenes, but... What?
[18:45.77]Who the... Who the fuck is Cleven?
[18:49.43]That's me!
[18:50.39]That's you?
[18:51.39]We just played a game together!
[18:52.67]I'm Cleven!
[18:53.29]What...
[18:55.03]I thought this was like a Steam user.
[18:56.61]No, Cleven's my real name.
[19:02.28]Wait, what?
[19:03.94]Cleven's my... Well, it's actually my middle name, but I went by it for a while.
[19:07.92]I thought that was the name of your guy.
[19:13.13]Wait, how did you know that?
[19:15.31]I thought you wouldn't know that.
[19:17.59]Yeah, Cleven... I don't know where Cleven...
[19:20.25]Cleven's a random name I made for a Rust server eight months ago on my Steam, and I've kept it there ever since.
[19:25.13]Wait, what the fuck?
[19:26.67]I was like, who is Cleven?
[19:28.79]I'm Cleven Ballsworth.
[19:30.67]Is that actually what you went by?
[19:31.97]Cleven Ballsworth?
[19:33.33]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19:36.03]I thought it was somebody, like, spammed Kevin really quickly.
[19:39.40]And they were like, I gotta get in this game!
[19:40.58]Like, Cleven!
[19:42.54]They just got really, like, just hastily fucked up the name Kevin.
[19:47.50]What is, uh...
[19:49.22]I'm buying a new one.
[19:52.48]Okay, hold on.
[19:53.55]Wait, wait, wait.
[19:54.49]Have you spent more money on the game than you have giving me a tier 3 sub?
[19:58.71]I gifted you a tier 3.
[19:59.53]Wow, you're just buying shit.
[20:02.83]Alright, I'm sticking with this guy.
[20:04.51]I don't know.
[20:05.49]Here's the thing.
[20:05.93]I was playing a Frenchman, which is just brain dead in war.
[20:09.36]Oh, by the way, soda, pop, or tonic?
[20:13.84]Which one are you?
[20:16.35]Soda, pop, or tonic?
[20:18.03]Soda.
[20:18.27]100%.
[20:18.78]Okay.
[20:18.94]Yeah.
[20:19.04]Good.
[20:19.40]Good answer.
[20:20.96]I'd imagine where you're... So I'm from New Hampshire.
[20:24.62]Oh, yeah.
[20:25.16]Alright.
[20:26.70]So I imagine we have similar... Alright.
[20:29.50]Let's do this.
[20:30.40]How do you say the area where you... Like in a house.
[20:36.65]Like a sectioned off area.
[20:38.59]R-O-O-M.
[20:39.33]How do you say that?
[20:40.09]It's a living room.
[20:42.23]And then just without the living part?
[20:44.07]Room.
[20:45.35]Me too.
[20:45.59]Yeah.
[20:47.12]I get a little trash for that for not going room.
[20:49.10]Yeah, but people always give me shit for saying other stuff, too.
[20:51.42]What are the other stuff?
[20:54.06]Room?
[20:56.03]Oh, okay, wait, wait, wait.
[20:57.73]What do you put your clothes in?
[21:00.29]The dryer?
[21:01.73]Okay, you take them out of the dryer.
[21:05.09]Okay, you wash your clothes, you dry them, you take them out of the dryer, and you put them in a...
[21:11.69]I feel like this is a trivia test now.
[21:14.19]Are you looking for the word hamper?
[21:15.91]No, no, no.
[21:16.89]That's what happens when you close the drawer.
[21:18.08]You've washed them.
[21:18.80]You've dried them.
[21:19.72]I've washed them.
[21:20.20]I've dried them.
[21:20.64]I put them away.
[21:21.36]Now you put them away in your... Well, usually in my closet.
[21:26.20]Okay, but like... How do I...
[21:30.65]What's the thing that you pull?
[21:32.19]Oh, drawer.
[21:33.69]Oh, now you fucked it up.
[21:35.35]You say drawer?
[21:36.30]Draw.
[21:36.56]What?
[21:38.70]It's a drawer.
[21:39.84]You're not saying the full thing.
[21:42.46]You're giving up halfway through.
[21:43.56]I gotta go to my drawer.
[21:46.40]Open up that drawer.
[21:47.96]But you know you're not finishing the sentence.
[21:51.71]Whatever.
[21:51.97]You're just saying draw.
[21:57.03]Draw.
[21:57.63]Yeah, my drawer.
[22:00.15]How do you, do you say underwear like that?
[22:01.95]Underwear.
[22:03.21]You don't go, my drawers?
[22:04.81]Underwear.
[22:05.73]Underwear.
[22:06.03]Just underwear.
[22:06.78]Okay.
[22:07.00]Yeah, underwear.
[22:08.24]But it's not, but here's the thing though, it's not underwear.
[22:11.00]It's underwear.
[22:12.02]Right?
[22:13.16]Are we saying it underwear?
[22:16.72]Underwear.
[22:17.34]Underwear.
[22:18.60]Am I saying it weird?
[22:19.74]Am I saying it weird too?
[22:21.28]You're making me self-conscious about how I'm saying that now.
[22:25.88]Anyways, dude, New Hampshire, New Hampshire, that's my fucking backyard.
[22:28.52]That's my backyard.
[22:30.75]Yeah, I'm one of those New Hampshireites that, you know, I'll just associate myself with Boston even though I got no business.
[22:38.77]Yeah, but New England.
[22:39.87]New England's New England, man.
[22:40.89]Red Sox Nation.
[22:41.51]Yeah.
[22:42.95]That's what I go for.
[22:43.69]I try to take all the teams, all the pride.
[22:46.37]Because we don't have much in New Hampshire, so we take what we can get.
[22:48.52]I like New Hampshire.
[22:50.56]I think New Hampshire's nice.
[22:52.08]It's good.
[22:52.64]You ever go up to Pheasant Lane Mall and no sales tax to buy something?
[22:57.08]I live in Vegas, man.
[22:57.92]We don't got to worry about that here.
[22:59.06]I guess that's true.
[23:01.48]I guess that is true.
[23:02.28]Well, no, sales tax, yes.
[23:03.54]But income tax, no.
[23:06.10]Yeah.
[23:06.68]I think there's no income tax in New Hampshire as well.
[23:08.64]No, there's not.
[23:09.12]Yeah.
[23:09.98]Yeah.
[23:11.00]But you have to live in New Hampshire, which means you probably develop a heroin addiction.
[23:14.65]Oh, God.
[23:17.99]Oh, by the way, I was just like absentmindedly placing stuff.
[23:22.89]I think this is okay.
[23:24.77]I feel like it's fine.
[23:27.41]Alright, so what is this for?
[23:28.63]Are we upping the stakes or are we lowering the stakes?
[23:31.79]Let's do it.
[23:32.31]So last time was a tier 3.
[23:35.59]I feel warm right now.
[23:36.61]I'm ready for a, you know, just like a casual 100 gifted.
[23:41.22]100 gifted subs for this one?
[23:43.74]Oh, God.
[23:44.58]What's that?
[23:46.88]It's $500, but honestly, with the write-offs, you get it all back.
[23:51.32]Vegas taxes, New Hampshire taxes.
[23:54.41]We can't go from $25 to $500.
[23:55.55]Okay, alright.
[23:56.81]Well, then you give a suggestion.
[24:00.47]What's a better escalation?
[24:02.09]And a better escalation would be 2X.
[24:03.71]So let's do $50.
[24:04.05]$50, which is what?
[24:04.49]Alright, $50.
[24:05.41]What do you mean, what is it?
[24:06.87]It's $50.
[24:06.99]Are we doing subs?
[24:13.07]Oh, yeah, we can do like 10 subs.
[24:14.35]Okay, 10 subs.
[24:15.45]Wait.
[24:15.71]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:16.61]Yeah, okay.
[24:17.69]Yeah, that works.
[24:19.29]I have a new strategy.
[24:20.31]You do.
[24:20.55]Oh, okay.
[24:29.94]Are you... Okay, there's psychology here.
[24:32.32]Like, did you do the exact same layout?
[24:35.94]No.
[24:36.66]Smart.
[24:37.32]I thought you were going to do the exact same thing.
[24:38.78]There's no reason why you ever would aim down here.
[24:42.11]I'm going to tell you right now, from J1 to A10, just in a diagonal line.
[24:48.85]It's going to take me too long to find that coordinate, so I'm just going to click here.
[24:53.66]I'm marching up diagonally, alright?
[24:57.46]Like Petco stock prices in 2000, and you just have to find me before I get to your ship, because I'm guaranteed to hit one on this path.
[25:07.53]Oh!
[25:07.71]Fuck.
[25:07.99]Alright.
[25:08.23]You found that quick.
[25:10.03]What do you... What is G3?
[25:10.79]What are you thinking?
[25:12.55]I don't know.
[25:13.29]G3 was speaking to me.
[25:14.37]Alright.
[25:15.57]Alright.
[25:15.83]Well... I'm sure you don't finish this off.
[25:18.17]You're gonna go the wrong direction here.
[25:19.73]You think so?
[25:20.75]Yeah.
[25:26.12]Why would you ever?
[25:27.94]I don't know, because I thought maybe you put him next to it.
[25:29.32]I was going to freak you out.
[25:30.02]I was going to freak out you.
[25:30.96]It would have been insane.
[25:32.88]It would have been insane, but it was just so bold.
[25:38.57]Oh, I found your super five, whatever they're called.
[25:41.59]Destroyer, I think.
[25:42.69]Or maybe, yeah, it's a destroyer.
[25:45.77]Look at that.
[25:46.23]Look at that art.
[25:48.15]Very cool.
[25:48.53]Alright.
[25:48.93]One more shot.
[25:51.03]So if I were you, I would be going right here.
[25:57.22]Oh.
[25:57.56]Okay.
[26:00.62]We're... We're... You know.
[26:02.26]Similar areas but... Oh.
[26:04.78]That's... But that strategy is unfair because you're guaranteed to hit something.
[26:09.38]Wait.
[26:09.62]What are you doing?
[26:10.44]I tried to be like you.
[26:11.38]I tried to be like you.
[26:13.54]You get bold sometimes.
[26:14.60]I thought I'd throw a little spice in it.
[26:16.08]You know?
[26:16.72]That was pretty spicy.
[26:23.21]Ugh.
[26:24.09]That was really close.
[26:26.58]That means it wasn't close at all.
[26:28.71]Oh, damn it.
[26:30.73]Oh, he went the wrong way.
[26:31.97]I hate going the wrong way.
[26:35.61]Gotta wait for Soda.
[26:37.70]Oh my god.
[26:38.42]Yeah, that was actually really close.
[26:44.68]Yeah, but they could all be really close.
[26:46.68]It's a 10 by 10 grid.
[26:49.13]Heads I go right, tails I go left.
[26:51.93]I'm gonna let you know just for fun, just for the sake of the broadcast content quality.
[26:56.57]It didn't matter which way you went.
[26:57.77]I just literally told you.
[26:58.97]I just actually told you.
[26:59.89]Why did I do that?
[27:01.46]That was not... For some reason, I thought I got the control of the... I thought I got control back.
[27:05.38]Why did I just tell you?
[27:06.10]I don't know.
[27:07.40]I would have kept going left.
[27:09.10]Yeah.
[27:10.38]Alright.
[27:11.06]Well, I feel good about that.
[27:12.68]I'm continuing my line.
[27:14.05]What are you giggling at?
[27:23.90]I took a sip of something.
[27:25.96]I can't tell if you're trying to... No, dude.
[27:28.20]Don't keep doing that.
[27:28.98]That's like a dumb strategy.
[27:30.26]Don't do... That's like stupid.
[27:31.94]Don't keep doing that.
[27:32.82]Oh, you're double getting me.
[27:34.70]Dude, don't be an idiot.
[27:36.16]That's like not... Don't do it.
[27:39.35]He's trying to double get me.
[27:40.63]Oh, no.
[27:41.15]Alright, you'll never get the direction.
[27:42.91]Yeah, I will.
[27:44.85]I won't.
[27:45.69]Obvious.
[27:48.55]Here.
[27:51.24]I thought you were laughing at something.
[27:52.76]You've really rattled me here.
[27:54.26]I think I've got you rattled.
[27:58.73]Oh, alright.
[27:59.19]You went down with it.
[28:00.37]That's good.
[28:00.81]Yeah, I went down.
[28:01.61]I went a little nuts with that.
[28:09.67]If my strategy nets me one ship, this is the biggest waste of time ever.
[28:13.62]I was going to say, that's a one for how many moves is it?
[28:18.98]Like 15?
[28:19.14]15, yeah.
[28:23.01]Alright.
[28:23.21]But how big is this one?
[28:24.87]Oh, she's a big one.
[28:27.85]Keep clicking.
[28:28.47]Keep going.
[28:29.01]Oh, man.
[28:30.81]Those are your two biggest ones.
[28:32.47]Those are the easiest to find.
[28:33.59]This is good for me.
[28:34.59]Because where I have hid my tugboat, it will take you years.
[28:41.44]Damn it.
[28:41.80]I thought it was that one.
[28:42.88]That would have been hard.
[28:44.06]Alright.
[28:45.44]Last one.
[28:46.06]And then I'm done my line.
[28:46.92]Okay.
[28:48.34]Yeah.
[28:48.82]You know, just go the other way.
[28:51.92]Do the other diagonal.
[28:52.86]You'll probably get something.
[28:56.88]I feel like you've wordplayed me a bit here.
[29:00.06]Maybe you told me right because there's something to the left.
[29:05.35]No, I think your strategy would work if you did it the other way.
[29:08.99]Wait, like A1 to J10?
[29:11.01]Yeah, you'd probably hit like five.
[29:12.35]Uh... Ooh!
[29:16.96]Found something!
[29:18.74]C2!
[29:22.08]Shit.
[29:22.60]Okay, okay.
[29:23.70]You're gonna fuck up the direction a couple of times here.
[29:25.70]Damn it.
[29:31.37]Ooh.
[29:31.81]Ooh.
[29:32.95]Is the lying better?
[29:33.93]I mean, yeah, kind of.
[29:36.93]I'll tell you right now, it's B2.
[29:38.61]I'll tell you right now, it's B2.
[29:39.61]I don't think it is.
[29:40.97]You gotta go up.
[29:41.73]You gotta go up.
[29:42.30]Trust me.
[29:43.54]I'm gonna do it.
[29:44.30]I'm gonna trust him.
[29:45.20]Oh, you got it.
[29:47.34]Up, down, left, right.
[29:49.22]Never eat soggy waffles.
[29:52.19]That wasn't even... Go B2.
[29:55.44]Trust me there.
[29:56.38]B2?
[29:56.84]Alright, if it's not B2, then I'm gonna be... Oh my god!
[30:01.64]What the hell?
[30:02.42]Why does it work?
[30:03.86]It worked!
[30:04.70]Honesty!
[30:05.16]Alright, we'll go B7.
[30:07.54]Alright.
[30:11.25]Fuck you!
[30:12.31]Got him.
[30:15.39]All this information I've given for what?
[30:17.19]I feel like a Bothan spy.
[30:20.51]Lie.
[30:20.81]Lying warfare.
[30:24.53]Alright, so where's your little one?
[30:27.21]My little one?
[30:27.77]Do you want me to tell it to you?
[30:29.15]Because I can't tell it to you.
[30:30.01]I can tell you the row.
[30:30.91]I will not tell you the exact number.
[30:33.55]Hmm.
[30:34.03]Alright.
[30:35.29]Give me the... Give me the row.
[30:37.94]It's G. It's G. It has to be with this one.
[30:46.38]Wait.
[30:47.34]But if it was two, it would have to be in the middle.
[30:48.75]I played Picker.
[30:49.45]It could go up-down.
[30:50.13]It could go up-down.
[30:51.01]They span.
[30:56.96]Cause they gotta, you gotta have up down, you know, cause it could be G and F. Oh, okay.
[31:02.12]G and H, you know, or.
[31:05.18]I think you're right here.
[31:05.90]No.
[31:09.68]You like, you like pairing things.
[31:12.96]I do.
[31:13.30]I like having things together.
[31:14.36]I like having things paired up.
[31:16.09]I just realized I didn't shoot this ship last turn.
[31:18.37]No, you didn't.
[31:20.79]I feel like you would do something like this.
[31:30.49]oh good call but nope so it looks like you okay you you actually made a pretty significant map here you moved around you have them all scattered out like like like an actual strategy I did that and it is it is not befruited me much
[31:53.65]Well, I mean, we're still... I'm one ship ahead of you.
[31:57.09]This can change in a second.
[31:59.05]That is true.
[31:59.63]That is true.
[32:00.21]And I did get one of your threes.
[32:01.65]I feel good about that.
[32:04.03]It's whoever's tugboat lasts the longest.
[32:07.23]This is going to keep escalating.
[32:08.84]It's going to keep... Dude, it doesn't matter who wins any of these right now.
[32:11.56]Because whoever wins the $500 one just wins everything anyways.
[32:14.80]Oh, yeah.
[32:15.24]No, you're 100% right.
[32:19.07]I just went to Vegas.
[32:20.03]I was doing like craps.
[32:21.31]You know, it's the game I like to play with like a big group of people.
[32:24.31]And I was betting modestly the entire weekend.
[32:27.40]And then Sunday rolled around and I was like, fuck it.
[32:29.88]I'm up a couple thousand.
[32:30.92]So I started betting just nonsensically.
[32:32.98]I just started betting like 500.
[32:33.94]I lost everything.
[32:35.56]Nothing I did mattered because I knew I was just going to escalate to a point where it was make or break.
[32:40.19]And I broke everything.
[32:41.03]It was gone.
[32:42.23]So, so wait, hold on.
[32:43.61]You were up thousands of dollars?
[32:46.25]I was up $4,000.
[32:46.93]Dude, you, come on.
[32:49.25]You got to do, come on, Gwyn.
[32:50.95]And then Sunday rolled around and I wanted to be up more money.
[32:53.75]So I just put it, you know, you play craps ever?
[32:56.81]I've dabbled a few times.
[32:58.56]I just put everything on the field.
[33:01.21]Just $4,000, you know, just trying to run it up to a- Like, you're leaving to go to Vegas?
[33:08.42]Like, 25 grand?
[33:08.90]What are you trying to do?
[33:10.20]Well, no, I have a goal.
[33:11.90]Because I think if you don't have a goal, it's not- it's stupid.
[33:14.26]Wait, you go- wait, hold on.
[33:15.54]You're going into Vegas gambling with a goal of how much money you want.
[33:19.92]Of how much money- of what I want to win.
[33:22.14]Oh my god, that's- that's not- that's- don't do that.
[33:26.06]I go in with a thousand, and I want to leave with a really nice watch.
[33:31.87]Oh my God.
[33:32.57]No, that's good.
[33:33.95]That's a good thing to do.
[33:36.23]I mean, if you're going to give it to you for free because you like hit a jackpot and they go, how about this watch instead of the 40 grand?
[33:45.16]I would be like, sign me up.
[33:46.76]Can I get two?
[33:47.28]Wait, you would take the watch over 40 grand?
[33:50.04]Well, I get like a really nice roll.
[33:52.42]I'd get a $40,000 watch.
[33:55.22]I don't know.
[33:55.90]Expensive watches always didn't do it for me.
[33:57.51]It was always just like somebody come take this from me.
[34:00.63]I'm not a watch guy by any means.
[34:02.99]I just think that getting it for this occasion would be, would be cool.
[34:07.29]Cause it'd be like my Vegas watch.
[34:09.05]And then people would be like, where'd you get that watch?
[34:10.45]And I'll be like, do I got a story for you?
[34:13.92]Walk them through every blackjack and craps table hand.
[34:16.72]The expensive watch on your wrist is like you've been in GTA online when somebody became like the bounty and they just showed up on the mini map.
[34:23.72]yeah it's just like you're just like showing up on everybody's mini map but this is gigantic expensive like 500 000 thing on your hand yeah if I were to leave my house sure but you know I just found look at all these empty spaces these gaps how have I not found you oh I misclicked that
[34:42.29]I don't understand where you could even be.
[34:44.67]Right here.
[34:46.53]I'm eliminating all these one spaces.
[34:49.03]Yeah, I'm actually wasting my time up here.
[34:51.41]Because there's so many places where you could have hit your tugboat.
[34:54.13]It's almost frustrating.
[34:55.89]Yeah, you focus so much on the top here.
[34:59.78]I'm clearing out the top completely.
[35:02.34]Because you could have hit it there.
[35:03.36]I'm going to be so sad.
[35:05.26]Look at this.
[35:05.90]Do you see A5 and A6?
[35:09.06]If your tugboat was there, I would lose my life going for the bottom, so I have to guess there.
[35:16.54]Is it possible to fill the whole board and not... Okay, what happens if you miss everything and like there's still boats on like spaces?
[35:23.53]Do we both just lose?
[35:26.85]Wait, there's no way to... It's not like you run out of bullets.
[35:29.49]Do you run out of bullets, actually?
[35:30.79]I don't know.
[35:31.09]Do you run out of bullets?
[35:32.30]No, I imagine not.
[35:33.66]That would be shocking.
[35:37.95]Alright, now I'm going for the five strat, because I know your destroyer's out there.
[35:43.51]I'm just looking for a place where there are two.
[35:47.14]There's a... And I got it.
[35:48.52]No!
[35:48.76]The other way.
[35:52.54]Oh, no.
[35:54.08]No.
[35:54.52]Okay, now I'm in trouble.
[35:56.75]I mean...
[35:59.24]What do you mean?
[36:00.98]I'm in trouble now.
[36:02.44]That's my battle.
[36:03.44]Look how nicely it was tucked in.
[36:04.84]You painted around it.
[36:05.88]Yeah.
[36:06.72]It was an actual, like in a Looney Tunes cartoon where they fire the machine gun at the person and it just does like the lines around them and then like the wall breaks behind them and they run away.
[36:15.63]Yeah.
[36:16.31]Yeah.
[36:16.67]It just falls behind them and there's just that faint outline.
[36:20.03]But then you still shot Bugs Bunny at the end, which was fucked up for a children's cartoon.
[36:25.43]Yeah, Yosemite Sam used to, like, shoot at people to, like, dance.
[36:28.16]Like, that's kind of fucked up, isn't it?
[36:30.26]It is fucked up.
[36:34.00]But also, in a way, art.
[36:38.37]Yeah, what, he'd be like, ah!
[36:39.79]Well, wait, was it just an awful shot?
[36:42.57]No, I think it was, like, abusive.
[36:45.93]He was firing at them to, like, at their left.
[36:48.09]But why wouldn't he just shoot Bugs Bunny in the stomach?
[36:50.50]I don't understand.
[36:52.94]Why not simply murder Bugs Bunny?
[36:55.04]Because he was always like... He would do that and then he would fire like 400 rounds at him.
[37:02.94]Yeah.
[37:04.08]Missing almost all of them.
[37:07.52]I think he just fits the stereotype like the get off my lawn.
[37:13.79]I'm never going to find this.
[37:16.05]That was a Family Guy joke.
[37:18.35]Whatever.
[37:19.83]You get that problem.
[37:20.33]Family Guy had good jokes.
[37:22.52]There it is.
[37:22.86]That's your destroyer.
[37:23.58]No, it's not.
[37:25.22]That's your destroyer.
[37:25.88]No, it's not.
[37:26.64]It's not even the destroyer.
[37:27.52]You're going too... It's too much.
[37:29.30]You're going to miss this last one.
[37:38.03]Heads I go right, tails I go left.
[37:45.37]God damn it!
[37:46.10]The coin!
[37:48.72]Got this head.
[37:49.88]That was me.
[37:50.30]That was all me.
[37:52.08]Don't think Jerm is even good.
[37:53.08]You're just really bad.
[37:53.94]Oh!
[37:55.56]No!
[37:58.89]Okay, look.
[38:00.87]Can you be bad at like throwing a handful of popcorn in the air and just like looking at the ground and picking up one or two random pieces?
[38:09.38]Can you be bad at that?
[38:10.42]Not really.
[38:11.84]I mean, let's be real.
[38:12.68]I did stack all of my ship into the bottom left last round.
[38:16.28]I think that's a bad strat.
[38:17.66]Well, I did the same thing though.
[38:19.28]Yeah, but even you had the, you know, the redundancies of throwing a tugboat in the top right as a security measure.
[38:25.69]Alright, alright, alright.
[38:26.97]Well, this is fine, though, because what I'm doing is hustling you.
[38:29.77]Because if I lose a couple, you start to get a little confident.
[38:34.92]That's true.
[38:35.72]You could be just pulling the hustle on me.
[38:37.82]And then I strike.
[38:40.94]Uh, okay.
[38:41.14]So what's that?
[38:41.56]So where, where, what?
[38:42.32]That was one tier one sub and then one ten subs.
[38:46.04]One tier three sub ten subs.
[38:47.26]You won $75.
[38:48.28]Alright.
[38:49.61]How much did you, uh, go into the casino with?
[38:53.63]I've, what do you mean?
[38:54.69]Walked, like, last, in Vegas?
[38:56.87]Yeah.
[38:57.15]Like, how much did you, how much did you go in with?
[38:59.33]I went in with $900.
[39:00.55]Okay.
[39:01.55]I'm gonna try to get $900 from you.
[39:03.65]That's, what, you're trying to fuck me like the casino did?
[39:09.09]Yeah, I'll give some back sometimes.
[39:12.05]You should think about me.
[39:12.95]We'll do another game where it's like, oh, this one's for $200.
[39:15.45]And I'll just lose on purpose and I'll just give you $200 and then you'll keep playing and I'll make it way harder.
[39:23.26]I have a really good strategy.
[39:25.73]where if I lose, like, let's say $500, I'll chase my losses and bet another $500 to win it back.
[39:31.58]And then if I lose that, I'll bet, like, $1,000 to chase those losses and win that back.
[39:38.82]Um... Wait, what is this?
[39:40.30]Hold on.
[39:41.49]Alone in the Dark?
[39:43.75]Is this, like, a... Is this an Alone in the Dark game?
[39:45.81]What?
[39:47.19]What are you looking at?
[39:48.89]Is this named Dev?
[39:49.95]I'm confused.
[39:52.68]Like, in the- is that- no, that's my- wait, it's my profile picture, I think.
[39:57.33]Are you looking at your own profile picture getting confused?
[39:59.31]Yeah, I thought this was like an Alone in the Dark dev made this or something.
[40:02.96]It was like an ad for Alone in the Dark.
[40:05.54]Now I understand and I remember.
[40:07.10]I made it Alone in the Dark because it's such like an unassuming profile picture.
[40:09.98]I used to hide when I played TF2 so people wouldn't know it was me.
[40:12.96]So I could just play a game and like hide and like make my name like fucking like vacuum cleaner and like make my profile picture something just completely unassuming.
[40:19.70]So that's what that is.
[40:20.26]It's been that long since you've changed your profile picture?
[40:22.56]Probably, yeah.
[40:23.24]It's probably been like two or three years.
[40:25.20]That's insane.
[40:26.27]Like, when you hold tab, it's like, I didn't have, oh, Jerma!
[40:29.79]Like, Germa985!
[40:30.81]The Jerm!
[40:31.43]The logo!
[40:32.11]Like, I didn't do that.
[40:33.21]Like, if you saw Alone in the Dark, you'd be like, oh, I don't fucking know anything about that guy.
[40:36.87]I don't care.
[40:37.51]Right, because then if someone saw Jerma, they might just chase you the whole time.
[40:42.62]Yeah, because I wanted to, like, be able to play without having, like, any, like, oh, there's, like, the guy.
[40:47.96]Let's go get him.
[40:48.94]Or, like, let's help him.
[40:49.92]I wanted to be, like, completely natural environment.
[40:57.73]Alright, that commander was not working out for me.
[41:00.05]It's time to buy a new one.
[41:03.62]I'm going complete free-to-play.
[41:06.54]I'm purchasing Sir Philip Wade.
[41:12.32]Look at my ships.
[41:13.26]They're beautiful.
[41:14.58]Yeah, actually the art does change.
[41:16.33]That's true.
[41:17.49]That's the only thing I'm paying.
[41:18.69]It's $3 every time.
[41:19.87]I've spent $9 on changing the art of my ships.
[41:23.09]I think you just woke up one of the devs of this game from Hasbro because they just got a text on their phone because that probably happens so infrequently that they have it tied to notifications on their cell phone.
[41:34.25]It's like a wolf blast.
[41:35.15]They get a text, an email, a Twitter notification.
[41:38.11]Alright, so what do we got going here for this one?
[41:40.54]What's going on here?
[41:41.18]So look, we've escalated.
[41:44.28]You've won two of the money ones.
[41:46.78]How about we remove the money for this one?
[41:49.94]I have a bit of a fun idea.
[41:51.62]Okay.
[41:53.57]The loser gets to buy a shirt for the winner that they have to wear on stream.
[41:58.79]Camera on, of course.
[42:00.95]Okay.
[42:03.05]So wait, but I buy a t-shirt that you have to wear on stream.
[42:07.12]You buy a t-shirt and I'll wear it on stream.
[42:09.86]Yeah, exactly.
[42:12.48]Alright, that sounds good.
[42:13.22]Any t-shirt the loser wants.
[42:14.60]Now, I will say it must follow TOS, obviously.
[42:17.38]Yeah, it's got to follow Terms of Service.
[42:19.79]No.
[42:20.89]But yeah, it's any t-shirt the loser wants.
[42:25.26]Oh, this is way more.
[42:26.56]This is way more than like $20.
[42:28.96]This is worth a lot more to me.
[42:31.02]This actually is more about we could go back to money and save this one because we can do this at any point.
[42:36.02]No, I'm into it.
[42:37.86]Someone said to look at the battleship category.
[42:51.28]Oh, come on.
[42:54.57]What is this?
[42:55.81]What is it?
[42:57.47]Look at the battleship category.
[42:59.01]Look at the battleship category.
[43:00.69]Yeah, on Twitch.
[43:01.77]Look at the fucking battleship category on Twitch.
[43:07.38]Okay.
[43:07.84]Hold on.
[43:08.18]I'm a slow boomer.
[43:09.24]It takes me a while.
[43:10.42]No, take your time.
[43:11.12]Take your time.
[43:11.62]I'm sure it'll stay there for a while.
[43:12.76]Okay.
[43:14.89]Back to Twitch.
[43:16.97]Battleship.
[43:20.13]Category.
[43:20.71]I'm so slow.
[43:21.75]You did this in two seconds.
[43:22.82]I'm like category dashboard Okay battleship Where is it fuck I'm too old for this I didn't need help.
[43:35.00]I'm gonna I'm gonna link it to you.
[43:36.24]You just click open my link It changed it.
[43:39.08]Did you oh there we go browse.
[43:40.18]Okay, and then you just got to show it to your chat.
[43:42.62]Okay battleship.
[43:43.98]Oh
[43:49.82]Who the fuck is it?
[43:52.62]I linked it to you on Discord.
[43:53.58]You can click it.
[43:54.26]Oh, thank you, son.
[43:55.64]Appreciate it.
[43:57.04]No problem.
[43:58.60]Oh, it's the directory, right.
[44:00.10]Oh, thank you, son.
[44:03.14]Person losing.
[44:04.20]Jerma 1, Ludwig 0.
[44:05.42]Person watching who's losing.
[44:06.96]Person who's watching the person.
[44:08.37]What the fuck?
[44:09.13]I want to screenshot this.
[44:11.80]No, it's not necessary to screenshot.
[44:13.92]This is amazing.
[44:15.16]This is terrible.
[44:17.32]No, this is incredible.
[44:19.08]It's slightly defamatory.
[44:20.42]I took a screenshot.
[44:22.55]I need that later.
[44:23.63]It's just my stupid face and then someone who's pointing to me losing and then someone watching me losing.
[44:30.95]Oh, should we encourage this or not?
[44:32.66]I feel like we shouldn't because now... Wait, someone said refresh.
[44:36.28]Oh, okay.
[44:36.88]Yeah, alright.
[44:37.42]Wait, did it get worse?
[44:38.66]Yeah, it did get worse.
[44:39.60]It's person who's watching the person who's watching who's losing.
[44:42.70]Oh, my God.
[44:43.51]You guys, you are blowing up the Hasbro guy's phone.
[44:48.79]Another person went live playing Hasbro's Battleship.
[44:51.67]Oh, my goodness.
[44:52.43]I can't wait to see what they're doing.
[44:53.99]We need to make a sequel to Battleship.
[44:58.06]Alright, we'll let that be for a little while.
[45:01.05]Yeah, let that fester and we'll come back to 18 people watching me lose.
[45:06.21]I need to win is what I'm noticing.
[45:08.07]I need to make a little bit of a comeback story.
[45:12.03]Look, it can't go on forever.
[45:13.39]I don't think I can win three in a row.
[45:16.25]You saying that is so stressful for me.
[45:19.35]Okay, I've gone... I want one less ship.
[45:26.44]There's too many.
[45:29.25]I've gone for a stratagem.
[45:32.89]This might be... This is stupid.
[45:34.85]This is so stupid.
[45:38.07]What a stupid thing I'm doing.
[45:41.75]Hold on.
[45:42.01]Let me see if this works.
[45:42.99]There we go.
[45:45.72]For people watching my chat, it's like... You know what I mean?
[45:53.88]Alright.
[45:54.22]Alright.
[45:54.94]I've developed a stratagem.
[45:57.10]Tails, come on.
[45:59.94]Person that goes first has a huge advantage.
[46:02.65]Just inherently... Because if you land, then you pretty much can get one.
[46:12.99]You don't know what direction it is, though.
[46:15.87]You're from East Coast.
[46:21.04]Why did you do that?
[46:22.14]Why did you do that?
[46:24.20]I clicked wrong.
[46:25.16]I just actually misclicked.
[46:26.16]What the fuck?
[46:27.40]What?
[46:30.62]What did I just stumble upon, Jerma?
[46:34.72]What have you done?
[46:35.82]The game's bugging for me.
[46:37.50]Is the game bugging for you?
[46:39.40]Oh, yeah.
[46:39.74]Is it bugging?
[46:40.80]I specifically remember a phrase that went, watch what I'm doing here.
[46:46.34]Come on.
[46:46.94]Give me that.
[46:48.00]That might have been the greatest misclick of all time.
[46:49.78]Alright.
[46:50.04]You went northbound on both of these then.
[46:51.68]Whoa.
[46:56.38]That's huge.
[46:57.24]You went northbound.
[46:59.22]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:59.80]Parallel.
[47:02.68]Look at this.
[47:03.54]That was the misclick of the century.
[47:07.24]No, this is bad.
[47:08.40]This is bad.
[47:09.08]I don't know why I don't finish it.
[47:15.21]I just forget about the ship.
[47:16.71]I think I see what you're doing.
[47:17.59]You're trying to see if I went that way.
[47:19.05]I did the same thing.
[47:21.47]Well, not that much of it, idiot.
[47:27.68]Alright.
[47:33.30]Don't buy the Mega Milk shirt.
[47:35.27]That's my one request.
[47:37.53]Don't say that one more time?
[47:38.80]Don't buy the Mega Milk shirt.
[47:39.84]That's my one request.
[47:40.76]Just don't do that.
[47:42.29]For you, when I win this, don't buy you the Mega Milk shirt.
[47:46.09]Yes.
[47:46.67]Please don't do that.
[47:47.91]Could you tell me why I should show you mercy here?
[47:51.19]Well, first of all, you got to win.
[47:52.65]Oh, my.
[47:53.17]You're looking at my screen.
[47:54.11]You're cheating.
[47:55.23]He's looking at this.
[47:58.02]How would he do that?
[47:58.90]I want to win this one.
[47:59.86]Hey, everyone gets one cheat.
[48:01.22]Come on.
[48:01.70]It's Twitch.
[48:02.26]You're allowed to cheat on one game show on one battleship game.
[48:06.74]Look, he's... No, but the thing is, though, I have something very hidden.
[48:10.76]He's not going to understand where it is.
[48:12.48]Okay.
[48:16.03]You know what would be wicked funny?
[48:18.55]If you got me a t-shirt with a band that I fucking hate more than anything.
[48:22.51]What is that?
[48:22.91]I don't know.
[48:24.32]I don't think I want to tell you.
[48:25.24]Because if you buy it, then it's really embarrassing.
[48:28.14]I have a, like, it almost feels the way you're posturing this is that you, like, you love this band.
[48:33.10]No.
[48:33.46]Well, I have a thing with my chat where I talk a ton of shit about the Gorillaz.
[48:36.52]Like, I just hate them.
[48:37.52]They're, like, the worst fucking band in history.
[48:40.04]Is this like me going, I would hate if you got me a signed Tom Brady jersey.
[48:43.08]Like, that would suck so much.
[48:44.54]Please don't do that.
[48:47.41]Where are your ships?
[48:48.39]They don't exist.
[48:49.75]You're doing the old rabbit.
[48:52.37]You're shooting around.
[48:55.35]Yeah, I really am.
[48:56.05]I have no rhyme or reason to this.
[49:00.57]Uh-oh.
[49:02.77]I think you put a ship in G3.
[49:10.34]You don't think about the letters or the numbers, do you?
[49:12.42]No, my brain just goes fire there.
[49:14.48]Yeah, there's no point.
[49:18.34]I don't think the numbers mean much.
[49:20.89]No, you're probably right.
[49:21.67]I think I'm putting too much weight into them.
[49:27.77]What so what is this mega milk shirt?
[49:29.37]I'm gonna look this up right now.
[49:30.59]Oh, don't don't don't look it up No, I'm serious gonna look it up.
[49:33.49]I'm actually serious like you probably shouldn't look it up on stream That's I would look it up off stream.
[49:38.15]Well.
[49:38.31]No don't but no no no no no don't look it up off stream either Don't even look just there's no way to click it.
[49:43.53]What the hell is this?
[49:44.75]It's not like oh hey off stream go look at this.
[49:47.03]No people are freaking out It's uh, it's just it's like I don't know.
[49:50.98]I don't know.
[49:51.28]I can't even explain it Just don't look it up ever
[49:53.26]Okay, I looked it up on Amazon, and what I saw was just shirts that said Mega Milk.
[49:57.24]They're very tame.
[49:58.86]But then one of the shirts has an anime character.
[50:02.65]Yeah, don't look it up.
[50:03.27]Really?
[50:04.27]Okay.
[50:05.03]Yeah.
[50:05.67]Yeah, I'm just trying to be careful.
[50:06.71]You're not talking about that, right?
[50:08.97]Like, obviously, that's not related.
[50:10.21]That's just a separate.
[50:11.29]No, somebody like, yeah, that's unrelated, and it's not, yeah, that's a bad, it's not even worth looking up.
[50:16.48]Okay, yeah, it's not even worth looking up.
[50:17.66]That makes sense.
[50:21.91]I wore that shirt, by the way.
[50:23.19]On stream?
[50:25.25]No.
[50:32.98]I have this shirt that's like a blue, like a Toronto Blue Jays-esque baseball tee.
[50:38.39]It's the blue sleeves and the white on the front.
[50:40.65]And every time I wear it, people say I'm wearing the Mega Milk shirt.
[50:44.13]And I'm just like, leave me alone.
[50:45.41]I like this shirt.
[50:46.17]I like the colors.
[50:47.79]Who the is Blue Jays-esque?
[50:50.53]Like it's the same color?
[50:51.67]Yeah, it's like that blue and white.
[50:53.91]Oh, but it's just like a baseball tee.
[50:54.93]It's just a colorful.
[50:55.71]Okay, alright.
[50:56.57]Yeah, I see that.
[50:57.55]So like the sleeves are different color from the body.
[51:00.43]And it looks like the Mega Milk shirt.
[51:03.47]Just without the text on it.
[51:04.96]The more you talk about this, I have to tell you, the funnier it is, the more I want to do this.
[51:12.07]Would I get suspended if I wore the Mega Milk shirt?
[51:16.00]Oh, I mean, look, Twitch is... I don't know which one you're talking about.
[51:20.66]You'd have to link it to me for me to know.
[51:22.62]Because I've worn a slew of bad things.
[51:26.53]A slew?
[51:28.25]It's numerous.
[51:29.55]Because I do an Amazon stream.
[51:30.71]I let chat buy anything and I'll wear it.
[51:34.29]So, you know, I've worn shirts that say, like, come in me, I'm here for the bukkake.
[51:38.95]I have a set of keycaps that are just gatchy keycaps.
[51:43.57]Just abhorrent things.
[51:48.30]I have a $600 statue of Nami from One Piece.
[51:53.67]Okay, the first one, you got me a little twisted on that one.
[51:59.35]You wore that on stream.
[52:01.87]The Come and Me shirt?
[52:02.91]Yeah.
[52:04.07]Oh, yeah.
[52:05.33]I wore that out.
[52:06.49]Wait, you wear this frequently?
[52:11.91]I wore it, like, because I don't leave my house often, so I wore it, like, you know, a pretty good amount in my home because I thought it was funny.
[52:21.54]But, like, you know, without thinking much, I went to Vegas one time and I was wearing that and I didn't realize...
[52:29.21]Until someone pointed at my shirt and went, that's insane.
[52:33.51]It's just like, oh shit.
[52:35.25]And I was like, oh shit.
[52:36.07]I put it inside out.
[52:36.97]I was embarrassed.
[52:37.95]And so it said Muckney M for the rest of the day.
[52:41.75]That's the kind of shirt you have to make sure is not available.
[52:44.80]Like if you have to do laundry or something.
[52:46.48]Like it's the only shirt left.
[52:48.48]Yeah.
[52:50.32]Finally, I fucking land on you.
[52:54.22]I do feel in a great spot right now.
[52:56.60]Because I only have...
[52:58.26]Your destroyer, which is a 5x ship, which can only be in so many locations.
[53:03.49]I'm in trouble.
[53:04.67]Let's see.
[53:06.47]This should be it.
[53:16.72]Oh, I get to live another day.
[53:23.06]What?
[53:23.62]Oh, you're up.
[53:28.99]Once you see my strategy, it's going to change the battleship meta.
[53:31.78]You think so?
[53:32.22]I genuinely think so.
[53:34.52]I went for a Jack and the Beanstalk method.
[53:38.10]Wait, does that mean that you went just in a straight line the whole way?
[53:40.97]No, no, no, no.
[53:43.67]Although that's a great strategy, I'm sure.
[53:51.33]I almost get the feeling that you're throwing on purpose because you want to wear this Mega Milk shirt.
[53:55.67]I don't even know why.
[53:56.79]You would have bought something.
[53:57.63]I don't even know why I said that.
[54:00.02]Yeah, I would have never.
[54:01.24]There's no universe where I would have gone, you know what?
[54:03.46]I'm going to get you a Mega Milk shirt.
[54:05.64]You brought it up.
[54:08.26]Like, oh, please don't do this to me.
[54:10.79]I don't know why.
[54:12.27]I get the feeling, you know, maybe part of you wants to try it.
[54:16.37]Oh, no.
[54:17.79]I might not get the opportunity.
[54:20.33]What kind of shirt would I get you if I absolutely probably, I'm not going to win.
[54:25.33]Let's not worry about that.
[54:26.77]I still, I only need one.
[54:28.55]You only need one, but.
[54:31.09]If you happen to get it.
[54:32.59]Okay.
[54:32.77]Alright.
[54:35.09]You're covering my Jack in the beanstalk.
[54:38.44]I am whiffing a lot though.
[54:41.46]On a five ship.
[54:47.51]Oh, come on.
[54:50.05]Painting around it.
[54:52.45]Okay.
[54:52.95]It's a five X. It can be here.
[54:57.00]It can be up here.
[54:58.22]Alright.
[55:05.82]So there's a two.
[55:09.65]It's a two and a four.
[55:11.50]And a three.
[55:11.96]And a three.
[55:14.72]I'll give you a hint.
[55:15.32]I'll make it spicy.
[55:16.30]What?
[55:16.62]It's not.
[55:16.90]You said Jack and the Beanstalk.
[55:18.20]That would be straight up.
[55:20.06]I'll give you a hint right now.
[55:22.71]You might need to refresh your browser.
[55:26.95]On Twitter?
[55:27.97]I'm watching your channel right now.
[55:29.11]I refresh your channel?
[55:32.98]F5, Jerma.
[55:34.24]It's like a technical joke.
[55:38.80]You're right here.
[55:39.90]No, he's not.
[55:41.76]Jerma, I told you we're... Oh, the way that you were telling me where you were.
[55:46.90]I was telling you.
[55:49.12]Oh.
[55:49.54]It's F5.
[55:50.72]I thought you were doing like a hit F5.
[55:52.32]You're watching my stream.
[55:53.31]I know you're cheating.
[55:54.11]Haha.
[55:55.23]No.
[55:55.41]No, I was trying to give you information.
[55:59.07]Oh.
[56:00.41]But I think that was the only place he could have been there.
[56:03.84]Well, congratulations.
[56:06.20]I feel good.
[56:06.80]I don't know if you threw that on purpose, but my strategy was pretty impeccable.
[56:10.93]No, I thought you were going up, up.
[56:15.43]Well, we don't know if he's going to buy the Mega Milk shirt or not.
[56:18.41]You know what I mean?
[56:18.83]Nobody knows that.
[56:19.53]Do me a favor.
[56:20.95]He might have something really funnier to do.
[56:23.17]If you could just link me the Mega Milk shirt you're referencing, what happens if I look up Mega Milk Jerma?
[56:33.24]Oh, I do not think you should do that.
[56:34.98]And I'm serious about that one.
[56:36.10]I'm dead serious.
[56:37.36]I don't know if you should write that.
[56:38.30]No, this is fine.
[56:39.69]It's just that the text can't be... There's nothing wrong with the text, right?
[56:43.21]Does Mega Milk mean something I'm unaware of?
[56:45.39]I don't know.
[56:45.81]I don't know what it means.
[56:46.77]I just know it's something that's like TOS.
[56:49.53]Look up Mega Milk on... Okay, that's a website I can't pull up.
[56:53.37]I don't know.
[56:53.95]I just know that it's like a thing.
[56:56.40]It's like some kind of potentially sexual thing.
[57:00.08]I don't know.
[57:00.74]Okay, I'm looking this up.
[57:02.14]You said the shirt, you like it, but you're just wearing it here.
[57:07.20]I mean, in broad daylight, you are wearing... No, somebody photoshopped that.
[57:10.77]That's not real.
[57:11.67]No.
[57:12.95]How would they photoshop with the lanyard?
[57:16.81]No, I know that image.
[57:17.97]Yeah, no, that's a photoshopped shirt.
[57:20.35]You're telling me that's not real?
[57:21.87]It's not real.
[57:22.43]No, I didn't wear it in public.
[57:23.49]I don't know if I buy that.
[57:26.52]It seems like an innocent enough shirt.
[57:29.17]just look how about this you'll just you'll think of something really funny to make me aware and it's definitely not going to be that one alright alright I'm gonna just link you an option and you just look at it and then I want you to react to it and tell me what you think okay so I did you gotta you can give it to me as an image by the way because I'm so stupid
[57:53.97]I don't... I don't... I don't want to wear that.
[57:56.73]You're not a fan of this one.
[57:58.17]Okay.
[57:58.51]I don't... This is like... I don't... Can I even wear this?
[58:02.09]How did you not get in trouble for this?
[58:04.43]Wearing your shirt that says, come in me?
[58:05.97]Hold on.
[58:06.63]I have to show it.
[58:07.27]This is... JPG?
[58:15.46]What is this?
[58:22.36]Why is this saved?
[58:29.60]Can I show this?
[58:30.34]I don't want to show this!
[58:31.40]I have to wear this.
[58:32.06]Is this what you're deciding on?
[58:33.56]Okay, we saw it.
[58:36.00]I don't want that on this camera.
[58:45.53]Oh, I just muted and deafened at the same time.
[58:48.93]Sorry.
[58:49.53]You've been deafened for, like, probably two minutes.
[58:51.39]I'm sorry.
[58:51.79]I hit the wrong button.
[58:52.43]That's alright.
[58:52.89]Are we gonna do more of these?
[58:55.92]Okay.
[58:57.66]It's...
[59:00.72]I'm just sending you a few shirts that I think... This one's pretty good too.
[59:11.02]You look sus.
[59:14.72]Are you showing your chat yet?
[59:16.15]Yeah.
[59:17.67]Each one that comes in, they're getting a view of it.
[59:20.25]Alright, alright.
[59:20.83]This is one I wore.
[59:21.83]Uh, quite a lot actually.
[59:25.99]My girlfriend took it.
[59:27.05]She likes wearing it now because it's a pretty comfy shirt.
[59:32.32]But affirmed, they have been worn on stream.
[59:36.94]Oh, my God.
[59:39.44]You said your girlfriend... Where's this... Now.
[59:43.06]Regularly.
[59:43.86]I mean... Alright.
[59:49.55]People are going to screen cap this.
[59:50.63]I have to go like... No.
[59:54.71]No.
[59:55.15]No, I am... That's not me.
[59:57.23]No.
[59:59.83]Yeah, you have to have your...
[60:05.13]What about this one?
[60:05.85]I do not look forward to wearing these.
[60:07.15]Okay, what do you got for me?
[60:18.99]Oh, what's the one?
[60:24.29]Alright, and this is one that I think is great.
[60:26.43]Which one?
[60:27.55]Here's the final one I have.
[60:28.62]Alright, there it is.
[60:29.72]What's this one?
[60:33.35]This is a fun one.
[60:34.59]Hold on.
[60:38.07]I'm saving them.
[60:44.33]I am... Is this safe?
[60:49.48]I'm 100% American, 75% Irish, 60% water, 50 cents biggest fan, 40 pounds overweight, 7 years from retirement, and 5 minutes from having to shit at this Lowe's.
[61:02.75]This shirt, this shirt sucks.
[61:05.75]Yeah, it does suck.
[61:08.40]This looks like an old like web page from 1995.
[61:11.04]Yeah, yeah, it'd be like the like the banner for like some shitty ass, you know, blog form or whatever.
[61:23.16]What is this one?
[61:26.26]So this, this is what you've narrowed it down to?
[61:28.95]Oh, I mean, I'll mull over a bit.
[61:31.49]You know, maybe chat can inspire me some more.
[61:33.95]A lot of people want you to have this one.
[61:36.94]I'll send it to you, but I wouldn't do this to you because I think this one's abhorrent.
[61:41.62]I think just even owning this is a bit of an atrocity.
[61:45.18]What am I owning?
[61:47.28]If you owned this, because you'd wear it, obviously you'd have to put it in.
[61:50.45]I don't want that one.
[61:51.47]I don't want this one.
[61:52.61]I know.
[61:53.03]That's why I'm saying.
[61:55.05]I don't want this one.
[61:56.21]I know.
[61:56.83]I know.
[61:57.53]Please spare me.
[61:58.91]Please spare me.
[61:59.95]I'll wear the cum shirt.
[62:01.17]I'll wear the cum shirt, okay?
[62:02.28]I'm serious.
[62:03.26]I'm not wearing this one.
[62:04.58]Where is it?
[62:08.82]No, no, no.
[62:09.92]Okay.
[62:10.26]Alright.
[62:10.62]Anyone but this one.
[62:13.29]If chat was to decide, that's what they would do.
[62:16.27]They would put that one on your body.
[62:18.71]But I wouldn't do that to you because I understand.
[62:20.71]There's, you know, there's lines.
[62:28.44]But I'll mull it over.
[62:29.66]I'll have to look at this Mega Milk a bit more.
[62:32.34]I got $70 and you got to humiliate me in front of everybody?
[62:37.15]Yeah, it does seem a bit imbalanced, doesn't it?
[62:40.05]What's a monetary equivalent to how much?
[62:42.83]Would you wear that shirt on stream for 70 bucks?
[62:46.09]I've worn that shirt for free.
[62:47.99]I paid for it.
[62:48.45]The pizza one?
[62:49.47]Yeah.
[62:50.05]You've worn the pizza one with the pizza.
[62:53.19]Yeah, so I do an Amazon stream and I let them buy anything.
[62:56.42]And I only get three vetoes.
[62:58.08]So I could veto that shirt or I could veto like a $10,000 engagement ring.
[63:02.94]So, you know, I have to pick my battles.
[63:08.17]Hold on.
[63:08.91]People link.
[63:10.35]That's so funny, dude.
[63:12.74]They just link whatever they want.
[63:14.42]Let me tell you.
[63:14.94]Can you buy cars on Amazon?
[63:17.28]You can.
[63:17.86]Yes, you can.
[63:18.42]You can buy a Chevy, a Ford.
[63:22.87]That's so funny, dude.
[63:23.95]Uh, alright.
[63:25.75]That's amazing.
[63:26.35]The category of Battleship has blown up.
[63:30.49]Checking the Battleship category?
[63:31.65]Let's see it.
[63:32.55]Oh, it's, it's, it's gone off the deep end.
[63:35.13]It's, there's, there's just someone with a Mega Milk shirt.
[63:39.09]You wanna play Among Us?
[63:40.47]These people, you're all gonna get banned.
[63:43.53]Jerma bukkake 4K webcam?
[63:48.65]You guys are all gonna get your, like, channels banned.
[63:52.83]Look at this guy.
[63:53.33]It's a big Jerma supporter.
[63:54.43]Go, Jerma, go.
[63:56.29]This dog's pretty cute.
[64:01.61]One of these guys has like 100 viewers.
[64:05.19]Yeah, the losing.
[64:06.17]50-50?
[64:06.67]Yeah.
[64:08.43]The person playing Among Us is doing well, actually.
[64:12.27]I think they're just playing Among Us.
[64:15.58]This one's just trying to get you to add an emote, Jerma Sag.
[64:19.24]Add... Sag...
[64:23.30]This person is zerking off on stream.
[64:25.12]Can you define zerking for me?
[64:27.52]It's from that streamer simulator game where everything had a Z replaced at the front of the word.
[64:32.70]Right.
[64:34.12]That is a good game.
[64:35.44]It is pretty good.
[64:36.05]This is an auto emote.
[64:38.85]I can't keep track.
[64:39.55]This is a chicken McNugget.
[64:41.97]I'm looking at you kissing Chuck E. Cheese.
[64:46.81]Did you ever hear the story of that?
[64:48.84]You kissing Chuck E. Cheese?
[64:49.88]Yeah, oh yeah.
[64:51.04]I'm not familiar with that, no.
[64:52.75]Chuck E. Cheese raided the channel last year.
[64:56.65]Oh, like the corporation.
[64:58.41]Like, actually, like, Chuck E. Cheese was streaming Fall Guys or something, and he, like, raided a host of the channel, and somebody said, put this on stream, and I said, what is it?
[65:05.61]And I didn't, like, really want to put it on stream, but, like, I just did it anyways, and, like, I think I fucked up and put it on twice.
[65:12.31]It was me kissing Chuck E. Cheese, like, on the lips.
[65:15.13]And they had already had it made?
[65:17.61]It was already ready.
[65:18.19]They had me kissing Chuck E. Cheese, but the funniest part about it is the Chuck E. Cheese stock price tanked when the image showed up on stream.
[65:26.52]Like, actually?
[65:27.36]Like, immediately?
[65:28.36]Like, actually, the real stock, like, went down.
[65:31.12]Like, when Cristiano Ronaldo said, I don't drink Coke, and the stock plummeted, you have the same effect on Chuck E. Cheese.
[65:36.33]But, like, I don't think that's what happened.
[65:38.97]I think they had, like, some kind of announcement or some kind of news or somebody, like, sold for some reason.
[65:43.77]Like, it just happened to line up to, like, the 10-minute window of me showing it on stream.
[65:50.75]I like to imagine the largest Chuck E. Cheese shareholder just watches you, you know, for entertainment and then happens to see that and thought, you know what?
[66:00.08]It's time to pull out.
[66:01.00]It's time.
[66:03.36]I don't think it was related at all, though.
[66:04.96]It was like just some weird, hilarious coincidence, I think.
[66:10.21]What is this?
[66:13.11]So what?
[66:13.43]Alright.
[66:13.69]So what are the stakes of the next one?
[66:14.75]If we're going to keep upping the stakes here, then now what?
[66:18.23]How do we go from... How do we add to the stakes?
[66:22.57]How do we add to the stakes?
[66:23.84]So, look, we flipped off money.
[66:25.82]We can go back to money.
[66:29.30]You want to go back to cash?
[66:31.72]We could do like... I think it's time we could do the 100 gifted match.
[66:36.91]Okay.
[66:38.59]Because I think if we're escalating shirts, then it goes outfits.
[66:43.39]Then one of us is going to become a cat maid for a day.
[66:49.11]Have you worn a cat girl costume before?
[66:52.53]No.
[66:55.85]I haven't.
[66:57.37]You haven't?
[66:59.05]Bugleberry.
[67:00.29]Bugleberry, right?
[67:01.69]That's my answer.
[67:03.71]If I looked up, for instance, like, Catboy Jerma.
[67:08.47]You would find plenty of material, that's for sure.
[67:12.09]That is a lot of... That's more fan art than times you've worn it, surely.
[67:16.89]Oh, yeah, probably by a hundred times.
[67:19.29]That's crazy.
[67:20.13]Fan fiction goes a long way.
[67:23.11]Are you getting the rematch?
[67:27.19]Oh, yeah.
[67:27.53]Sorry.
[67:29.48]Oh, there he is.
[67:30.10]Cleven.
[67:30.92]But I'm happy to do a 100 gifted match.
[67:34.02]You want to do 100 gifted subs?
[67:36.48]I think that's a strategy.
[67:38.06]Alright.
[67:38.70]Alright.
[67:38.96]100 gifted subs.
[67:39.68]Let's do it.
[67:41.38]Okay.
[67:41.97]Sir Philip Wade.
[67:43.25]He's never lost.
[67:45.47]This is really important.
[67:46.61]This is for a lot of money.
[67:50.87]Let's do this.
[68:12.10]I'm ready.
[68:13.10]I'm not ready.
[68:21.76]I'm not ready.
[68:22.26]Hold on.
[68:23.98]This is a bad strat.
[68:25.12]Is that good?
[68:41.77]Everybody?
[68:43.51]That's weird, right?
[68:44.31]That's like a weird one.
[68:45.23]That he won't ever figure it out.
[68:46.73]No?
[68:47.35]You're throwing.
[68:48.21]No, I'm not.
[68:48.75]I don't think he's gonna get this.
[69:00.59]I think this is the winner right here.
[69:01.71]I really do.
[69:02.13]Done.
[69:11.43]That's the winner.
[69:12.95]Oh, God.
[69:16.29]Are you happy with yours?
[69:18.67]I am as happy as I think I could be.
[69:22.44]I think my chat bullied me out of my strategy, which was a straight line up the middle.
[69:27.47]You probably would have won.
[69:28.95]That was a mistake.
[69:29.85]I'm kind of like a frog brain.
[69:31.67]I probably wouldn't have done it.
[69:34.21]I think you've gone back to being a corner Karen.
[69:44.88]Let's see.
[69:45.78]What if you did this, though?
[69:46.84]What if you went right in the middle?
[69:48.88]Yep.
[69:51.73]If you get this... Okay.
[69:53.11]Alright.
[69:53.43]Save.
[69:53.75]Alright.
[69:54.13]At least I know where you are.
[69:56.09]Living another day.
[69:56.85]I have a finite amount of time before you hit.
[70:05.74]So I gotta make this count.
[70:06.92]Oof.
[70:09.04]Oh no.
[70:11.70]Oh god.
[70:12.44]Alright.
[70:12.96]Alright.
[70:13.52]So here's your destroyer right here.
[70:15.74]Oh no.
[70:16.70]You went down?
[70:19.06]Yep.
[70:19.58]Yep.
[70:19.90]I think you're avoiding all the edges.
[70:29.58]Corner Karen.
[70:30.14]This is a waste of my time.
[70:32.24]I feel like I'm wasting this.
[70:33.46]You're not a corner Karen.
[70:34.92]Maybe you avoided the edges.
[70:35.92]Not in those corners.
[70:36.82]Not in those corners.
[70:38.24]Oh, you're trying to get me to click the last corner, but I'm too smart.
[70:40.90]I'm never going to click the last corner.
[70:43.40]Well, then I guess you're never going to win the game.
[70:46.56]You've swayed me.
[70:47.60]Fuck.
[70:49.52]You're a villain.
[70:53.17]What if I told you something was right next to my destroyer?
[70:57.35]It probably is.
[70:59.57]I'll get there eventually.
[71:01.31]Don't worry.
[71:01.83]I'm just saying what if I told you.
[71:03.75]I'm not telling you that.
[71:04.69]Okay.
[71:12.00]Alright.
[71:12.42]Alright.
[71:12.98]But, I mean, it could be anywhere.
[71:17.44]It would have been so badass if I had hit another ship.
[71:19.70]Oh, you're just trying to be like, throw the ball behind your back and swish?
[71:24.04]Yeah.
[71:24.69]I wanted to try to... That was someone who has never seen basketball before trying to explain that.
[71:32.80]What?
[71:33.60]You said throw the ball behind the back and swish.
[71:36.56]It sounded like you'd never seen the sport of basketball before.
[71:38.84]No, no, I'm talking about like you, you like turn around and like face away from the hoop and just throw it backwards and try and get a swish.
[71:46.09]Oh yeah, just behind the back.
[71:47.65]Yeah, just an absolute, it was a, it was a YOLO attempt.
[71:51.12]Oh, you thought I meant like, oh yeah, the guy that like throws the ball around his back and goes into the hoop, that thing.
[71:55.12]Yeah, like an announcer's first day on the job.
[71:59.43]Oh, shit.
[72:00.11]Uh-oh.
[72:00.71]Alright.
[72:01.19]I'll make a wager with you.
[72:02.45]Oh, wait.
[72:03.09]Right now?
[72:04.17]No, no, no, no.
[72:04.87]I was going to say if you got the right direction, I'd give you five subs.
[72:09.50]Oh, shit.
[72:10.04]You got it.
[72:11.44]You got it.
[72:11.72]I feel good about that.
[72:12.78]I think if you land this next one right here, just this next hit, it just has to be the next hit.
[72:19.35]I'll wear the Mega Milk shirt tomorrow.
[72:25.57]Oh my god.
[72:26.42]I have a feeling your strategy was having your ships go from the edge towards the center so only one piece of it touches the edge.
[72:37.56]I don't know.
[72:38.56]I don't think so.
[72:41.61]Right now, my heart is like, oh.
[72:44.95]This is a bit stressful.
[72:50.79]Well, I didn't want to wear the Mega Milk shirt tomorrow.
[72:53.45]Yeah, that would have been bad for you.
[72:54.85]Yeah, it would have been really bad.
[72:56.05]Oh, okay, okay.
[72:56.53]Here, here, here.
[72:57.29]Alright.
[72:57.99]I will wager you five gifted.
[72:59.55]You don't know which direction I'm going here.
[73:01.79]So if I hit, I get another five gifted.
[73:04.01]That's right.
[73:05.06]But if you miss... Thank you.
[73:08.06]I'll get that.
[73:08.52]Yeah, I'll get that right away, Jerma.
[73:11.78]I do have to open your stream to gift that, though.
[73:15.76]Why don't we keep a tally so that we can just remember later?
[73:18.33]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[73:19.95]Because it is kind of like you have to like push this and then you accept and then process and then process.
[73:24.66]Oh, no.
[73:24.88]I was saying because I would see where you are.
[73:27.36]Oh, right.
[73:28.00]Yeah.
[73:28.42]Hey, don't do that.
[73:29.96]Hey, don't do that.
[73:32.96]Oh, no.
[73:34.33]Are you shitting me?
[73:35.33]Oh, no.
[73:35.63]And it's right here.
[73:37.13]Are you shitting me?
[73:38.35]Oh, no.
[73:39.79]You're in a lot of trouble.
[73:41.91]I am in a lot of trouble.
[73:43.29]I think you've discovered my stratagem.
[73:47.06]Oh, no.
[73:47.34]Oh, you get another one here.
[73:48.50]If you get one right here... You're doing like the... Everybody's facing in.
[73:53.65]Oh, no.
[73:54.81]I found you out.
[73:56.41]I was doing... It was a cross.
[73:58.25]It was, you know, like a... Like a Christian cross.
[74:02.67]Well, it's... You're in a lot of trouble now.
[74:06.41]Well, you'll never get my two boat.
[74:09.68]Imagine it's just in the center linking everything.
[74:11.76]Well, I thought you were drawing.
[74:12.88]Okay.
[74:15.50]Okay.
[74:17.36]there we go oh left right I'm actually oh no maybe it's a tugboat going down so this might take me a while because it's just your two boat that's the only thing it's just my two boat and it should realistically take you about 10 shots to get here realistically but it's too bad that it's right here
[74:45.99]Ah, it's left to right.
[74:47.21]Damn it.
[74:49.08]It's too bad that it's right here.
[74:52.34]I thought you were going to do the thing where it's, like, up.
[74:54.78]That was a dangerous shot.
[74:56.68]Oh.
[74:57.36]Because now you've left the corner open.
[75:00.17]Can you do it? Can you do it? Can you do it?
[75:02.27]Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat.
[75:11.60]That's another 10 gifted subs.
[75:12.26]No, I'm just kidding.
[75:13.72]You practice.
[75:14.30]You're embarrassing me now.
[75:16.80]I have.
[75:17.10]I actually have.
[75:17.86]I do that all the time.
[75:18.62]I have a lot of practice.
[75:22.86]That was actually really good for a first timer.
[75:24.38]I'll tell you.
[75:26.22]Yeah.
[75:26.42]You guys are like meetings.
[75:27.62]You do meetups.
[75:29.11]Some people.
[75:29.53]People can't even get past the second one.
[75:30.91]That was pretty good.
[75:31.53]It really was.
[75:31.95]I'm serious.
[75:33.37]I appreciate that.
[75:34.69]I used to do when I was younger.
[75:37.21]There's some French tongue twisters you could try.
[75:40.29]What are they?
[75:41.89]So it's... The English translations, if your uncle shaves your uncle, then your uncle will be shaved.
[75:50.56]But in French, it sounds like: Si ton ton ton-
[75:51.56]That's very literal.
[75:54.26]The French one is: Si ton tonton tond ton tonton, ton tonton sera tondu. And then fast, it's: Si ton tonton tond ton tonton, ton tonton sera tondu.
[76:02.26]Whoa. Do that again.
[76:03.14]It's not necessarily hard to say.
[76:06.59]Say it again?
[76:07.23]Yeah.
[76:08.13]Oh, say it again.
[76:08.45]Yeah, I want to hear that again.
[76:10.23]Si ton tonton tond ton tonton, ton tonton sera tondu.
[76:15.23]Si tonton tond ton ton ton ton ton ton todu.
[76:19.23]You sound fluent.
[76:19.53]Wait say that again.
[76:21.53]So it's: Si ton tonton (that's how you say uncle) tond (which is shave) ton (your) tonton, ton tonton sera tondu (will be shaved).
[76:37.67]I feel like the Charlie Brown parents talking.
[76:45.93]We are now just the adults.
[76:47.78]We can't communicate with the children anymore.
[76:50.50]We still have a destroyer somewhere.
[76:58.29]There we go.
[76:58.77]That wasn't a Family Guy joke.
[76:59.91]That was literally, he just said a thing in French.
[77:03.80]They're calling my joke a Family Guy joke?
[77:05.30]They just said Family Guy joke.
[77:06.32]I know.
[77:07.18]Unbelievable.
[77:07.76]I can't believe them.
[77:09.82]Everything we try to do on this platform, Peter fucking Griffin is already done.
[77:15.68]I can't believe he's not in Fortnite.
[77:16.96]I was so sad when he didn't get in.
[77:19.22]Oh, you got it.
[77:20.86]Wait, that's huge for me.
[77:22.35]Actually, that's very big.
[77:23.75]This could be a comeback of epic proportions.
[77:28.93]I'm actually kind of nervous because...
[77:31.58]Like you said, I have to find just your little two guy.
[77:35.12]Yeah.
[77:35.40]And that could be anywhere.
[77:41.28]I... I do think you have a strategy that might be in my favor here.
[77:50.39]Oh, it could be anywhere.
[77:51.79]It's going to take me forever to find this.
[77:57.27]Okay.
[77:57.69]Alright.
[77:57.97]I just have to... I have to rein it in.
[78:03.74]Just focus.
[78:08.22]It's gonna be, like, in a weird place, like... I'm trying to clear every 5x area.
[78:24.55]Why is everybody saying Aaron?
[78:27.07]I'm not gonna do that.
[78:28.39]Aaron?
[78:28.57]No, I'm not gonna embarrass myself in front of Ludwig, no.
[78:31.69]Wait, what's Aaron?
[78:32.54]Aaron.
[78:33.64]It's this thing that people like that I say.
[78:37.48]Do what?
[78:38.39]Say it.
[78:38.63]Okay, have you watched Attack on Titan?
[78:41.43]Yeah, of course.
[78:42.43]Okay, the dub of Attack on Titan or the sub?
[78:45.61]I think I've watched both, but mostly the sub.
[78:48.83]But I think my first season was dub.
[78:50.99]You've seen the dubbed actors in the show?
[78:54.66]Yes, yeah.
[78:55.34]So if I were to go like this... Eren!
[78:57.96]Eren!
[78:58.52]Eren!
[78:58.64]Eren!
[78:59.65]You would know what that was?
[79:00.85]Okay.
[79:01.75]I would imagine that's the blonde twerp.
[79:06.80]You're... What the fuck?
[79:08.10]You just hit two.
[79:09.22]What the hell is going on here?
[79:10.22]Am I right?
[79:13.56]Yes.
[79:13.92]That would be Armin Arlet.
[79:15.90]Yeah.
[79:16.24]That's him.
[79:18.44]I like that show.
[79:19.16]Do you like that show?
[79:20.06]I do.
[79:21.35]Do you watch a lot of anime?
[79:22.75]Do you consider yourself... Once a year.
[79:25.45]I give myself one anime a year.
[79:27.37]That's what I'm allowed to do.
[79:29.86]That's just so you don't become a weeb or?
[79:33.44]It's just because at time and because, you know, there's a million animes you get sucked in.
[79:37.39]You watch like a hundred of them.
[79:39.11]You're right.
[79:39.51]I give myself one anime a year.
[79:43.33]I only watch.
[79:46.17]Oh, fuck.
[79:55.33]No, no, he's got it.
[79:57.81]He's got it.
[79:58.51]Just one more and he's got it.
[80:00.09]Oh, thank the Lord.
[80:01.17]Now I have everything's onto this.
[80:05.20]Alright.
[80:05.50]The greatest comeback of all time.
[80:06.78]If you get this.
[80:10.02]There are two places where it could be.
[80:13.48]Because I don't think that you would put it this close.
[80:16.74]I don't.
[80:18.42]You're either right here, right here or here.
[80:25.91]You want a hint?
[80:31.90]No, I don't trust your hints.
[80:34.38]I think you're one of these two.
[80:38.63]This would be like a perfect map if it was like one of these two.
[80:45.07]I'll give you a simple hint, and this is honest.
[80:56.14]That little tugboat.
[80:58.00]It was right next to my destroyers to the left of it.
[81:01.27]Oh, no.
[81:02.49]Oh, now I have to give you a hundred subs.
[81:09.58]Let me tell you, you were right.
[81:10.60]You called it.
[81:11.82]You were like, oh, I've won these petty games for $75.
[81:14.34]And I have to wear the fucking cum t-shirt and pay you $500.
[81:18.79]This is exactly what happened.
[81:22.03]Taking you for all your worth, your pride, your dignity, and your wallet.
[81:26.57]I won the two games.
[81:27.47]This is like the pool shark.
[81:29.13]You know what I mean?
[81:30.19]Like, oh, hey, how about the first game for 20 bucks?
[81:32.85]And it's like, oh, man, I missed.
[81:34.82]I suck at pool.
[81:36.26]And then you just clean me out before I leave.
[81:37.90]That's exactly the plan.
[81:42.30]Alright, well, jot it down.
[81:43.87]I'll get it to you at the end of the stream.
[81:46.37]Yeah, yeah, no rush, no rush.
[81:49.11]Alright, so how much higher can we go with this one?
[81:54.09]So we could, we're going to reach a point of power creep where we've gone too high.
[82:00.34]Yes.
[82:03.64]And here's the thing about me.
[82:06.02]I live my life by the gambler's philosophy.
[82:09.07]So once I start to lose a little money, I'll dump my net worth till I get it back.
[82:13.85]I don't think I'm the right guy to guide this ship.
[82:15.83]I'll let you make the next bet.
[82:21.54]well that was a money one yeah that was so what if we up the stakes and do a non-money one what would it look like I'll throw out a couple of things that work one is uh a tweet a tweet of the of the of the person's choosing uh-huh yeah yeah that's pretty good I would get a tweet on your Twitter oh those are rare
[82:48.18]Those are rare, but it's pretty equal value, I would say, because you rarely tweet.
[82:54.18]That's true.
[82:54.80]And I tweet pretty much all the time with my sponsored shit.
[82:58.99]Yeah, you probably have like five times the followers that I have.
[83:02.07]But I have a few more followers, exactly.
[83:03.65]So it's about even because the rarity versus just the followers.
[83:07.75]Okay.
[83:08.85]I like this one.
[83:09.47]Yeah.
[83:10.37]We get to, you get to craft a tweet.
[83:12.01]Wait, is this like a, so like it would be as if it was me tweeting, but you wrote the tweet.
[83:17.48]Exactly.
[83:18.06]Yeah.
[83:18.22]You would never be able to explain.
[83:20.12]Cause you know, we have a good amount of viewers here, but you know, we have hundreds of thousands of followers.
[83:24.18]You'd never be able to explain to those followers why that was tweeted or be like, Oh, I had to tweet this because of some, some dumb bet.
[83:32.13]Oh yeah.
[83:32.87]It has to be like you just, this is you talking.
[83:35.67]I'm going to show you an example of a tweet I had to do because I lost a bet against, you know, Disguised Toast?
[83:42.91]Yes.
[83:44.55]I had lost a wager to him, and maybe this isn't the best to pull up on stream, but here's the tweet regardless.
[83:52.98]Can this include picture or video?
[83:56.20]Yes, but I would say I won't go as harsh as Toasted.
[84:00.78]Do you see the tweet?
[84:01.82]Oh, let me see.
[84:04.49]I saw the pizza thing.
[84:06.33]What is this underwear?
[84:09.63]Is this you?
[84:11.25]This is my ass.
[84:12.35]It's a picture of me in briefs with the caption.
[84:15.01]Anyone want to sniff?
[84:16.45]What the fuck?
[84:20.07]Toast was not.
[84:20.91]He was not exactly gracious in victory.
[84:25.48]He was quite merciless.
[84:28.82]Anyone want a sniff?
[84:31.72]Yeah, and it's a picture of my butt in briefs.
[84:35.26]Okay, because I was going to say, I was going to, like, just have you take a picture of, like, an apple core and just have the, like, the text over it be, what the fuck, dude?
[84:43.09]You know what I mean?
[84:44.37]Like, something like that.
[84:45.17]Like, yeah.
[84:45.63]Yeah, that's what I was going to have you do.
[84:47.85]No, that's what I would go for.
[84:49.31]I would, this is, you know, toast went all out.
[84:52.74]I'm showing you, this is, like, this is a high end.
[84:54.70]You know, this is probably, like...
[84:56.30]This is where it caps out.
[84:58.16]I'm not expecting this or going to do this if I won.
[85:01.02]And I would hope you wouldn't do this to me if you won.
[85:04.22]It's more so an example of a tweet in the past.
[85:07.00]Okay, hold on.
[85:07.60]I got to show this because it's important.
[85:08.94]I didn't even show it yet.
[85:09.64]There's maybe no eyebrows, but don't look at that one yet.
[85:20.38]That's a great thing to have right there.
[85:25.59]Just pulled off your street.
[85:26.49]That's a bit of a zoom actually you had going on.
[85:27.99]That's quite a zoom.
[85:30.19]This is your ass.
[85:31.15]What are you doing?
[85:32.91]I'm staring at a portrait of myself.
[85:38.99]By the way, I think that you have been the first person to ever have me show the word of become on my screen, by the way.
[85:45.01]Just want to make sure we're clear on that one.
[85:47.85]Should I be ashamed or proud?
[85:51.29]Probably both.
[85:52.01]Yeah, it's a mixture.
[85:53.47]Yeah.
[85:55.80]Alright, so I think that's a fair wager.
[85:59.33]Oh, that's fair.
[86:00.51]Did you just purchase Sir Philip Wade?
[86:03.35]No, I didn't buy anything.
[86:05.53]It shows on my screen that you're playing as Sir Philip Wade.
[86:09.13]Wait, yeah, what's going on?
[86:12.60]What's this?
[86:12.92]Is this you?
[86:16.68]Yeah, I think we're in the same game, but for whatever reason...
[86:22.85]Alright, I have a genius strategy to line my ships here.
[86:26.88]Uh, can you give me a number between 1 and 10, please?
[86:29.10]Uh, 3.
[86:39.94]Now, are you under the impression that Battleship is somewhat of a skilled game?
[86:43.66]Yes, I think it's very, I think this is gonna be huge.
[86:45.96]Uh-huh, okay, yeah.
[86:48.57]Do you not think so?
[86:50.11]No, I'm just asking questions, yeah.
[86:56.04]This is a pre-show to how everybody's going to be playing this.
[86:59.78]This is a huge deal, right?
[87:01.36]Everyone's going to love this game.
[87:02.34]Everyone's going to get into it.
[87:05.39]Prove to you that this is a game made for children that actual trained monkeys would do better in.
[87:13.65]I've randomly placed my ships, and I'm using a random picker to shoot your ships down.
[87:22.79]Randomized shot, randomized placements against your strategies.
[87:30.22]So?
[87:31.86]We'll see.
[87:32.46]If I was able to win with pure randomness, then I'd prove to you this is a game for little baby boy children.
[87:43.28]My strategy is not good.
[87:57.51]Alright, I think the best way to go about this is to do it twice.
[88:02.81]Which is... There's no way!
[88:08.90]I mean, no.
[88:09.74]There is no way.
[88:10.32]You know where you're gonna get it.
[88:12.08]Yeah, that's one space.
[88:22.18]That was another behind-the-back swish attempt.
[88:26.94]I'm random number generating every single hit.
[88:29.76]You are?
[88:30.20]Yeah.
[88:33.16]Wait, what?
[88:35.48]Yeah, so every time I hit... So you're randomly generating the number and the letter?
[88:43.18]Yeah, I'm just basically doing two 1 through 10s and then just counting first down and then over.
[88:52.51]Well, shit, that's a huge advantage for me.
[88:55.77]We'll see.
[89:01.61]I have a feeling that this is an impeccable strategy.
[89:06.45]It actually might be very good in 95% of every game.
[89:20.27]Oh, shit.
[89:22.67]Are you committing to this the whole game?
[89:25.29]I think I might follow up on some of the reds.
[89:29.97]because random number generators don't do well after a hit.
[89:40.36]Oh, no.
[89:43.22]Alright.
[89:43.60]You're right here.
[89:45.12]You always put one here.
[89:46.48]Oh, no.
[89:47.40]What?
[89:47.76]That's your poker face.
[89:48.60]Have you discovered me?
[89:50.08]Yeah.
[89:50.96]Alright.
[89:51.22]Or north, south, east, west.
[89:52.88]It doesn't matter how many pairs of hoods and sunglasses you put on.
[89:55.60]I can see right through this.
[89:56.53]I know you have one here every time.
[89:59.32]Alright, good guess.
[90:04.46]Alright, north, south, east, or west?
[90:05.90]North.
[90:07.40]North, south, east, or west?
[90:08.30]North again.
[90:08.70]There we go.
[90:10.62]Oh.
[90:10.96]Alright, alright.
[90:13.01]Let me do one more random.
[90:16.17]And then I'm going to try following up.
[90:20.37]Shit.
[90:21.79]The longer this goes, the worse I feel like my strategy is.
[90:25.52]Okay.
[90:26.58]There goes your destroyer, but that's the easiest one.
[90:28.79]I want to find these two.
[90:34.69]Oh.
[90:36.49]I still think you did something like that.
[90:39.46]Oh, I'm bad at counting, it turns out.
[90:43.84]Damn it.
[90:46.12]Hmm.
[90:48.31]I think
[90:50.65]I think you did something like this.
[90:52.15]I really do.
[90:53.39]Well, you have to understand.
[90:54.87]I'm not lying to you.
[90:56.39]I randomized it.
[91:00.28]Oh, okay.
[91:00.84]Alright.
[91:01.06]For this one.
[91:01.72]Oh, wait.
[91:02.12]You didn't.
[91:02.82]Oh, I see what you mean.
[91:04.32]The ships were randomly placed.
[91:06.24]Oh, alright.
[91:06.86]So that actually is an advantage for me.
[91:08.82]Although you coincidentally did get my destroyer.
[91:15.52]Oh, my gosh.
[91:16.48]Yeah.
[91:17.48]If you're going to the right here, this is brutal.
[91:24.41]I'm making so many faces into my face cam.
[91:26.29]Like, every time I click, I turn and I go like... I'm such a fucking YouTube face.
[91:33.10]Alright, whatever, you got it.
[91:34.60]Good reactions.
[91:35.44]Destroyer?
[91:35.88]Oh, okay.
[91:37.62]Yeah, yeah, whatever.
[91:39.00]Alright, alright.
[91:41.21]7-6.
[91:47.40]alright well whatever you got that one we're even now it's perfectly even unless you happen to hit something here oh yeah which you don't okay oh this would be a funny one oh no okay funny one why funny is there a Jason yeah that would be actually very funny
[92:16.05]Humorous in a way.
[92:17.59]That would be very funny.
[92:20.11]Again, it was randomly generated ships.
[92:23.23]It would freak me out if you actually did that.
[92:25.69]That would be so funny.
[92:28.09]Okay.
[92:28.67]Alright.
[92:29.55]I might abandon my strategy here.
[92:32.45]I'm realizing I might swing over to your side.
[92:35.27]This could be a game of skill.
[92:36.39]It's incredibly frivolous what you're up to.
[92:37.95]How are you not down there?
[92:41.21]I don't know.
[92:42.72]Okay.
[92:43.16]You hate the edges.
[92:44.22]You love the center.
[92:49.93]Fail again.
[92:50.49]Oh, no.
[92:56.51]And for once... Left or right?
[92:58.11]I ain't left or right.
[93:03.45]You're right.
[93:03.81]Yeah, this is it.
[93:04.81]Right here.
[93:05.43]You're both.
[93:06.23]I got it.
[93:06.57]Oh, come on.
[93:08.52]I tried to sway you with the left or right.
[93:13.48]Yeah, I would say you're flailing right now if it were me.
[93:17.60]What is on the line here?
[93:18.50]A tweet?
[93:21.72]A tweet.
[93:23.44]I would love to tweet on your Twitter account.
[93:26.94]For sure.
[93:31.55]Finally, it's my turn.
[93:38.69]I think the computer went that way.
[93:42.39]You think the computer has rhyme or reason?
[93:44.47]Oh, fuck.
[93:46.04]A phenomenal hit.
[93:47.92]That was randomly generated.
[93:49.60]Oh, did you T-bone yourself?
[93:53.55]T-bone?
[93:53.85]What does that mean?
[93:55.25]Like, did you put a ship going into your ship so that it would be a collision?
[94:02.46]That would be very unwise.
[94:05.12]Oh, you connected it too.
[94:06.48]You actually T-boned yourself.
[94:09.76]There's no confirmation that that's what happened.
[94:12.90]What do you think?
[94:15.94]The ship pulls a last second left turn?
[94:18.06]It's an L-shaped ship?
[94:19.14]Alright, I'm going to ask you to freeze, Ludwig.
[94:23.94]I have a feeling... Did you grow up Catholic at all?
[94:29.28]Yeah.
[94:31.98]Okay.
[94:32.94]I thought perchance there was a cross of David.
[94:36.26]That doesn't make any sense.
[94:40.39]Of Christ.
[94:41.81]Come on!
[94:42.43]How are you not there?
[94:43.13]Okay.
[94:44.25]Back to my strat.
[94:47.29]What a... Oh, I've already done it.
[94:48.85]Okay.
[94:50.03]Then I'll just do my own.
[94:54.45]What's your favorite animal?
[94:58.81]Favorite animal.
[94:59.23]What's your favorite animal?
[95:00.53]A zebra.
[95:01.83]A zebra.
[95:02.59]Mine's a frog.
[95:04.47]Why?
[95:04.67]I kind of just like the word.
[95:08.33]You... The reason it's your favorite is because of the word?
[95:12.46]I enjoy the word, especially the letters.
[95:17.02]I love that green frog.
[95:21.94]Are you hinting at something here?
[95:26.06]F is for frog.
[95:29.08]But why would he hit?
[95:31.14]Could it be?
[95:34.24]Does he need more tweets?
[95:41.05]What did your computer do?
[95:47.29]That was a terrible shot by the computer.
[95:52.74]No, I'm not.
[95:53.44]Alright.
[95:54.22]It's right here.
[95:55.66]How is it possible?
[95:56.66]They all are probably up top.
[96:00.34]I would never say.
[96:01.28]There's no way you're not up here.
[96:09.43]Somewhere.
[96:10.27]It's statistically impossible.
[96:12.59]I promise you that northbound will be in your undoing.
[96:20.08]You think so?
[96:20.50]There's no way you're here.
[96:28.91]Oh my god.
[96:59.30]What are you up to over there, Jerma?
[97:01.14]Nothing, nothing.
[97:03.76]Okay.
[97:06.24]I could really take this home.
[97:09.52]But I'm going in everything, every place that you're not.
[97:13.01]It's impossible.
[97:14.61]That's a redo.
[97:19.03]Was that random or was that you?
[97:21.89]It had already been on that spot, the one that it selected, so I went.
[97:26.63]It's kind of my rule.
[97:27.49]It's random unless it already had picked one that's already been shot.
[97:31.09]Oh, well.
[97:34.42]Two.
[97:41.48]Alright, you just have little ones left.
[97:43.34]Right here.
[97:44.53]I got a couple little ones.
[97:46.23]Yeah, that's right.
[97:47.15]I mean, you have just a lot left.
[97:49.39]I do have quite a bit.
[97:50.31]Yeah, I've already done this one.
[97:53.53]Maybe... You have a four somewhere.
[97:57.74]Alright, this is me going here.
[98:02.46]I could cover... That was such a bad shot.
[98:11.41]It was just a bad shot.
[98:15.73]Uh-oh.
[98:18.83]Oh, come on.
[98:19.81]There's no more... How many more places can you be?
[98:22.17]Three, two?
[98:24.09]Okay.
[98:30.54]I think... Well, you've left entire sections open.
[98:36.68]Yeah, maybe a little bit.
[98:39.18]Or three?
[98:39.74]What a terrible follow-up.
[98:43.38]This is the worst randomly generated shot of all time.
[98:46.11]It only hits a tugboat that just happens to be adjacent.
[98:53.17]Maybe you are, like, right here.
[98:57.03]No.
[99:01.33]One, three.
[99:02.25]They're actually screwing me.
[99:04.48]Look, I've done like a row.
[99:06.54]I'm just cleaning out.
[99:07.46]You've done an entire row.
[99:11.96]I'm suddenly thinking this strategy is not impeccable.
[99:16.70]I think we've already done that.
[99:18.58]Yeah, we have.
[99:19.24]Okay, it's me again.
[99:20.76]It's you?
[99:22.10]Let's clear out.
[99:25.40]Let's clear out this one here.
[99:27.93]Covers up and down for three.
[99:29.41]Mm-hmm.
[99:33.17]I have to assume that you're... Because you have a two.
[99:36.61]You know what I like, but you have to understand this was not me.
[99:40.83]This was not you.
[99:41.63]That's right.
[99:42.09]It doesn't matter if I'm a middleman.
[99:44.60]Bingo.
[99:45.04]Oh, no.
[99:49.52]Bingo.
[99:49.98]Alright.
[99:52.16]There we go.
[99:55.78]N8.
[99:55.90]We've already done that.
[99:59.63]Uh...
[100:07.98]What are you laughing at?
[100:10.90]Nothing.
[100:12.78]Just, I mean, there's a bit of laughter.
[100:14.09]It was a little bit of laughter, but it was kind of humorous what just happened.
[100:18.37]Okay.
[100:19.27]Me shooting was kind of humorous.
[100:26.19]Back in this bullshit again where your two is.
[100:30.22]I mean, I guess you aren't random.
[100:45.50]Got one.
[100:48.28]Is that the letter F?
[100:50.80]No.
[100:55.40]What a terrible round to do randomly generated shots on.
[100:58.82]I know.
[101:00.30]I know.
[101:05.69]It's not over.
[101:06.63]It's not even close to being over.
[101:08.83]No.
[101:10.49]Especially considering I found you too.
[101:13.35]Well, good for me you didn't.
[101:14.55]What?
[101:15.59]No, it's not my 2.
[101:19.04]7, 10.
[101:23.86]Going in, surely.
[101:25.30]It has to be a 3 or 2.
[101:26.00]No, it's going up.
[101:28.51]Damn it.
[101:30.47]I shouldn't have talked myself out.
[101:32.51]Shit.
[101:34.67]Okay.
[101:35.17]Is that your 2?
[101:35.55]No.
[101:37.52]No, this is a three.
[101:38.18]It's up or down here.
[101:39.58]Okay.
[101:40.04]Alright.
[101:40.66]Alright.
[101:41.76]I got to nail this right now.
[101:44.06]Okay.
[101:44.68]You have struggled on twos before.
[101:46.38]There are 3,000 places this one could be.
[101:48.72]There are.
[101:50.32]But... Oh.
[101:52.54]Alright.
[101:54.46]You're going in.
[101:56.34]I've painted around this.
[101:57.40]I've genuinely painted around this one.
[101:59.08]Thank the lords.
[102:00.68]Alright.
[102:00.98]You got a good shot here.
[102:02.04]Okay.
[102:03.78]And by good shot, I mean it could be anywhere.
[102:06.18]It could.
[102:07.71]This could be B10, C10.
[102:11.83]Alright, I'm going down now.
[102:16.57]And that means the only ship left is a three-man boat.
[102:20.75]I don't think a randomly generated thing functions as well anymore.
[102:24.72]Where is there a three?
[102:28.52]Where is there a three?
[102:29.66]It could be at this half dozen places.
[102:31.50]Here?
[102:42.87]Damn it.
[102:44.19]That was a weird choice.
[102:45.41]It was.
[102:46.45]Because you could have gone left one and covered more.
[102:54.74]Okay.
[102:54.96]I'm a bit stressed out right now.
[102:59.84]I am too.
[103:05.18]Oh, gosh.
[103:07.48]Where are the three?
[103:08.62]This covers a lot.
[103:15.71]No, I have to think about this.
[103:17.09]This is no longer random.
[103:18.55]Surely you didn't do anything to muddy the letter F. So this must have been a displaced boat to have somewhat of a coverage in case I found the F. It could be like a J3.
[103:32.49]No, I should have gotten one more to the right.
[103:39.61]It could be a really tall F.
[103:42.66]I mean, that would be interesting if I were to do something like that, wouldn't it?
[103:48.10]I can't tell if you're trying to convince me not to do it.
[103:51.88]I guess I thought the F was over, but it could have just been beginning.
[104:00.03]I mean, that would be very interesting.
[104:01.81]If I were you, I would maybe take a shot.
[104:06.34]Wait, you did do that?
[104:07.36]Yeah.
[104:08.92]Why would you tell me that?
[104:11.04]I was doing the psychology thing where you're like, oh, why would you tell me?
[104:13.62]I thought you were just telling me.
[104:17.09]Oh, no.
[104:17.29]Now I have to tweet something.
[104:18.47]Oh, what a tall F. I was going to do the whole thing.
[104:25.87]But I figured, of course it was right there.
[104:29.25]Yeah, the randomly generated was terrible.
[104:31.91]I mean, you didn't have the best stratagem for sure, but... I lost the last three in a row.
[104:36.43]I won the first, like, two or three in a row.
[104:39.21]You know what it is?
[104:39.95]It's whoever gets the tugboat first almost just assuredly wins.
[104:43.80]Yeah.
[104:43.98]Because finding the tugboat as the last thing, it's miserable.
[104:49.52]I know.
[104:49.98]It's the worst.
[104:51.72]So I, I have a, I have a, I have a tweet now.
[104:54.88]Yeah, you get the, you get to have a tweet.
[104:56.94]This is, this is valuable.
[104:59.36]I mean, this is, this is, I tweet something maybe once every like four months.
[105:04.35]Yeah.
[105:04.53]You're not, um, the most avid Twitter user.
[105:08.35]Is there a reason for that?
[105:09.21]No, it's kind of, I don't know.
[105:11.62]I just don't care.
[105:13.36]Yeah, sure.
[105:15.67]You know, I think it is because I can never think of anything to say.
[105:18.35]I have so many drafted tweets that I just write and then I just delete.
[105:22.34]Right.
[105:23.48]What I'll do is I'll send it and then I'll delete it, which I think is harder to do, you know, because sometimes after you've already sent it, you don't want to delete it, which makes me tweet more often.
[105:34.92]Exactly.
[105:36.46]I'll read you my last two drafts.
[105:38.47]Yeah, please.
[105:39.87]Fortnite is starting to look a lot like those old Smash Brothers character leak screens.
[105:44.11]The ones with Heathcliff, Pepper Ann, and Al Bundy on them.
[105:51.05]And the other one?
[105:52.45]If almonds are available, I'll eat them till I throw up.
[105:55.00]That's... That's... They're alright.
[106:04.90]Can you speak on that one?
[106:08.45]I just, I don't know if a bag of almonds is there.
[106:10.09]I'm just going to keep eating until somebody tells me to stop eating them.
[106:15.65]But I didn't tweet those.
[106:16.65]I did those.
[106:17.25]I'm like, yeah.
[106:18.71]Do you, do you have the ability to, to protrude your stomach?
[106:26.26]Yes.
[106:28.88]Like, in a pretty severe way that people would think, you know, you're working on a baby.
[106:32.27]Wait, you want, you want a jokey stomach protruding, like, in the, okay, not just in a mirror, like, in the oven reflection that you see.
[106:41.46]And you go, holy shit, is that me?
[106:42.82]Yeah.
[106:47.82]Is that something you're capable of doing?
[106:50.14]You want a stomach protrusion picture.
[106:51.60]Okay.
[106:53.30]Waist up?
[106:53.96]Full body?
[106:55.18]I think a stomach protrusion picture with your second drafted tweet is... What do you mean?
[107:03.01]You want that?
[107:07.43]To be honest, you tweet so rarely that anything is great here.
[107:12.87]So you want...
[107:14.80]are available I will eat them till I throw up and do the like I got a big stomach picture yeah yeah like uh you know kind of like how Twitter would be used in like 2013 oh god okay okay I'll do it just I could eat almonds till I throw up and then you know your stomach's so full because you've eaten so many almonds it's it's comical in a way
[107:44.86]Alright, that sounds good to me.
[107:46.20]Alright, what do you want?
[107:47.56]What do you want my hands?
[107:49.58]Am I like, like holding it like like underneath like it's a big globe or like a big bug juggly or what am I doing?
[107:56.87]I think you create creatively can can take this any direction you want because I think you know what my sentiment what my what my desire is here.
[108:05.89]And you can you can get it done.
[108:09.54]Somebody said, this is literally fetish art.
[108:14.18]It does feel like any time you even like... Any part of you that you give out to your stream is just taken and they just run with it.
[108:24.55]There's going to be fan art for years on pregnant Jerma.
[108:30.51]I'll do my best.
[108:35.17]Can I go pee?
[108:37.13]Yeah.
[108:39.87]Yeah, please.
[108:40.55]Please enjoy.
[108:41.79]I'll be right back.
[108:42.44]I'm going to go pee.
[108:44.46]I'm looking forward to this.
[108:46.07]Yeah, of course, of course.
[112:38.91]Alright, I'm back.
[112:42.86]Sorry, I'm back.
[112:46.70]It was one of those times where you pee and it just doesn't stop.
[112:53.90]You know what I mean?
[113:00.69]Oh, did he just go AFK?
[113:05.49]Alright, well, whatever.
[113:06.15]We can wait.
[113:06.47]We can hang out.
[113:13.35]Why are you guys not playing the advanced game mode?
[113:19.73]I mean, you play classic.
[113:23.23]It is an advanced game mode.
[113:24.67]Maybe we'll do that in a minute.
[113:30.04]I don't know, when we talked about doing this stream, it was just like, oh, maybe we'll play this in like 45 minutes.
[113:36.80]Maybe do something else.
[113:37.61]I'm very invested.
[113:40.17]I have to try to at least make some, what I may, I got $70 the first like two or three games.
[113:46.31]So let's, let me get, let's, let's break this down a little bit.
[113:48.98]So I won the first few games and I got 70 bucks.
[113:53.58]He won the last few games and gets $500, a tweet on my Twitch and gets to make me wear a cum t-shirt.
[114:03.09]That's, this is, this is a little skewed.
[114:08.62]I have to win one of the big ones!
[114:10.06]I gotta win a big one!
[114:13.70]I actually got pool sharked.
[114:19.36]You get a free shirt though, that's right.
[114:20.89]Five gifted.
[114:25.27]Why do you have such a hard time saying the word penis?
[114:36.65]Please explain.
[114:40.06]like that time you thought your zipper was down you almost said the word penis five times but stopped I don't know I said it there hello how are you uh good just just pissed pissed why uh why
[115:08.81]Oh, you went to the bathroom.
[115:09.63]You went pee.
[115:10.13]I thought you meant, oh, I'm just sitting here pissed like I took too long or something.
[115:13.35]Oh, no, no.
[115:14.12]I had to go to the bathroom.
[115:17.30]Do you pee sitting down, by the way?
[115:18.98]No.
[115:20.16]Have you ever used a bidet?
[115:22.30]No, and I find them to be revolting.
[115:24.98]What?
[115:25.79]Yes.
[115:26.61]Are you a bidet user?
[115:30.21]This is...
[115:31.89]This is gonna fracture us in a way.
[115:33.71]Are you sure?
[115:34.28]Okay, I need to be enlightened.
[115:35.74]Explain to me.
[115:36.26]So let me tell you what I think when I think of a bidet.
[115:39.06]Uh-huh.
[115:40.66]So, after you're done with the bathroom, after you go to the bathroom, you're finished.
[115:43.30]It's over.
[115:44.66]Turning a water jet into your asshole, wouldn't you get shit and poop water all over your legs and butt and stuff and make more work for yourself?
[115:52.25]I don't understand.
[115:52.73]Explain it to me.
[115:53.31]I need it.
[115:53.59]I need to know.
[115:55.08]Right.
[115:55.40]Okay.
[115:55.72]Alright.
[115:57.00]First of all, I'm not going to come at you.
[115:59.81]You just seem to be a little bit ignorant on all the positives.
[116:03.21]So I don't want to shame you.
[116:05.93]I'm open to it.
[116:07.86]uh it's it's the greatest thing I've ever used it's changed my life I'm a bidet not just a user I'm like a I'm like a salesman for bidets okay tell me uh so you can get you can get like a rinky dink one on Amazon it's like thirty dollars it blasts cold water at mach five in your and it it's not comfortable I use a fancier bidet I use right now the toto sw2034
[116:33.64]Is that like an AMD chip?
[116:35.90]What was that?
[116:37.18]This is about as expensive as a 3090, alright?
[116:39.94]Let's just put it that way, okay?
[116:42.77]This has five different types of oscillating sprays, ten different pressure gauges, alright?
[116:49.81]Warm heated water, also an air drying capability, so you don't even need to use, you know, toilet paper if you didn't want to.
[116:58.16]Comes with a deodorizer.
[117:00.33]Comes with white noise maker, so if you're pooping and you don't want people to know you're pooping, it makes white noise for you.
[117:05.29]That shit doesn't work.
[117:05.97]It doesn't matter how loud your TV is.
[117:07.81]Everyone's going to hear the, like... You've never used the Toto.
[117:14.00]Look, it's just more hygienic.
[117:17.10]You're cleaning a rug that has dirt on it with, like, you know, sandpaper.
[117:22.98]What kind of Toto paper are people using?
[117:26.01]I'm just saying, even if you're using three ply, it's cleaning a rug with bounty.
[117:29.23]That's not going to take it out.
[117:30.74]What about the wet wipes, right?
[117:32.34]What about the wet wipes?
[117:36.22]They're good, but they're not as great for the environment.
[117:40.13]Also, you need to keep re-upping them.
[117:42.99]Uh, you know, they're not always flushable.
[117:45.36]Look, I understand it.
[117:47.54]I will say it's a concentrated spray.
[117:50.38]It's not gonna get on your legs.
[117:51.98]That's absurd.
[117:53.23]It's confined.
[117:54.51]Isn't your asshole wet?
[117:56.17]How do you go from, like, spraying your butt and butthole with water?
[118:01.06]to like now I'm putting my underwear back on that always confused me so you use the bidet and then it's a it's a one wipe here's my sales no way no way no way I'm sorry I don't feel that doesn't make me feel clean let me tell you what if every poop for the rest of your life was a one wiper it's impossible
[118:21.24]That's what a bidet does.
[118:22.68]Cause I'm not normal though.
[118:24.01]I have like colitis.
[118:25.41]Like, I don't think that would work for me.
[118:26.67]That would be like messy.
[118:28.75]No, it'll, it will work for you.
[118:30.89]Trust me.
[118:32.07]Trust me.
[118:32.67]Look, how about this?
[118:33.76]How about this?
[118:34.92]I'm going to get you bidet.
[118:37.29]Alright?
[118:37.65]You're going to buy me a bidet?
[118:39.31]I'm going to buy you a bidet.
[118:40.95]I'll help you set it up.
[118:42.33]You can try it.
[118:44.10]If you don't like it, I'll take it out of your sight.
[118:47.12]I'll burn it.
[118:47.76]I'll destroy it.
[118:48.38]We'll have that scene in an office space where they destroy the fax machine.
[118:52.05]Yeah.
[118:52.81]We can do that with the bidet if you don't like it.
[118:55.41]Wait, did I already make this joke on my stream that, like, me having a bidet, I would do the, like, laugh out loud Will Ferrell skit where he, like, needs to take a drink out of water and he, like, takes a drink out of the bidet fountain?
[119:04.55]Right?
[119:04.93]Like, that's a Will Ferrell thing.
[119:06.39]Did I already make that joke?
[119:08.21]You haven't made that joke yet.
[119:09.51]Okay.
[119:10.48]It's up for grabs.
[119:11.40]I just made it.
[119:14.02]Oh.
[119:14.86]Sorry.
[119:15.88]We can redo it.
[119:16.68]I'll redo it.
[119:17.44]Alright.
[119:18.46]Did you think that was funny?
[119:20.29]Yeah, it was great.
[119:21.11]Well, it's actually too close to home.
[119:22.89]I drank out of a bidet for $40 a couple years ago, and it was a big meme, and then I did it again last month for $50.
[119:31.22]Why are you drinking out of a bidet for $50?
[119:34.22]Because $50 is $50.
[119:36.28]I mean, you put that on a craft table, you could walk out with a Rolex.
[119:38.54]Why do I imagine you with, like, crooked sunglasses on, like, eight drinks in?
[119:44.22]Like, I need another hit.
[119:45.70]I'll drink out of the bidet.
[119:46.86]Fuck it.
[119:47.26]You're going to give me 60 bucks?
[119:49.18]I'm just sitting in the bathroom and people are coming in.
[119:51.14]I'm just harassing them.
[119:52.74]Oh, you think I won't?
[119:54.06]You think I won't?
[119:55.14]And they're like, can we get a little bit out of the bathroom?
[119:57.70]He's just drinking out of the bidet.
[119:58.90]He's annoying.
[119:59.42]He's at eight drinks.
[120:00.76]Get a load of this guy.
[120:01.74]He thinks I won't.
[120:02.64]It's like, no, and I don't want you to.
[120:05.84]I keep lowering the amount of money that I'll do it for.
[120:08.19]40.
[120:09.35]You think I won't pay you to drink out of this bidet right now?
[120:12.63]You think I won't do that?
[120:14.34]You just put your hands on it, you do a headstand and like keg stand the bidet.
[120:18.76]I'm way too adept at it.
[120:19.96]I'm too skilled at drinking out of it.
[120:21.44]People are weirded out.
[120:24.13]Yeah.
[120:25.65]That's me.
[120:26.57]No, they're amazing.
[120:28.07]I'm going to do that.
[120:29.21]I've done this before for a different friend of mine.
[120:31.61]You've purchased bidets for multiple people.
[120:34.63]Eventually, I'm not lying to you, eventually my goal is to create my own bidets and sell them.
[120:41.26]Jesus, dude, you really want me to play World of Warcraft.
[120:46.80]That's like the I need to get my friend to play World of Warcraft.
[120:49.18]Hey, I'll buy for the first month, man.
[120:50.96]I'll boost you up.
[120:51.88]You need items?
[120:52.70]Oh, and let me tell you the lore of this place.
[120:54.70]This gets me no, there's no, this is a selfless endeavor.
[120:57.76]Well, until I sell them, then that's a selfish endeavor.
[120:59.76]But for now, it's a selfless endeavor because I just think it's such a great product.
[121:04.05]You know, it's World of Warcraft because I'm trying to play with you.
[121:06.51]I don't know what happens when you shit, Jerma.
[121:08.97]I've never thought about it until today.
[121:12.42]just want me to have a much better experience yeah I want you to feel about how I do which is it's like it's like a good exp it's pleasurable not well that's not it's not pleasure but it's a good exp it's like a it's a good experience it feels good good experience it's a positive experience is what I was looking for okay is it before we move on one final question
[121:35.01]Does the water hit you in the bag?
[121:40.86]You know what I'm saying?
[121:47.20]I imagine, like, really cold water hitting me right in the balls.
[121:51.83]And it's like, oh!
[121:53.53]Oh, okay.
[121:54.39]Alright.
[121:54.75]Well, look, there is much like a car seat.
[121:59.39]When you get in for the first time, maybe you're a little too far up and you need to crank it back.
[122:03.52]But after you've done it, you should be fine.
[122:05.32]Unless you sit in obtuse ways every time you get on the toilet.
[122:09.28]Once you get your mode, you're good.
[122:12.12]This is how I sit on the toilet.
[122:13.26]You should have like a phone.
[122:14.72]It's usually like this.
[122:18.38]I'm watching.
[122:19.95]Yeah, that's fine.
[122:20.87]That seems standard.
[122:22.15]It seems like a standard... Okay, that's oddly 45 degrees.
[122:26.75]It's still fine.
[122:27.41]It's just, you know...
[122:28.86]Yeah, it's fine.
[122:29.86]That's fine.
[122:30.82]Do you have long balls or something?
[122:32.81]Yes.
[122:34.61]Oh.
[122:36.73]Okay.
[122:37.43]Sorry.
[122:41.29]Look, I'll tell you this.
[122:42.31]It's not cold water as well.
[122:43.77]It's heated water.
[122:44.57]Yeah, but there's different kinds.
[122:46.25]Are you going to buy me like the... Alright.
[122:48.41]Are you going to get me the Cadillac or are you going to get me like the used car?
[122:54.50]I'm getting you the Ferrari.
[122:57.57]You're going to walk into your bathroom, you're going to think you walked into a SpaceX ship.
[123:01.65]It's going to make noises.
[123:02.69]It's going to have blue light emanating from it.
[123:05.60]It's going to be amazing.
[123:08.86]Sign me up.
[123:09.48]I'm down.
[123:10.98]Yeah, I'll get it for you.
[123:12.82]Alright.
[123:13.22]Do you want like a live reaction?
[123:15.72]Like after I come out of the bathroom, I'm like, let me tell you about it.
[123:18.14]Like, is that what you want to tell you exactly?
[123:19.99]Like right after I use it?
[123:21.93]I don't need to be gratified immediately.
[123:24.27]I think I'm so confident in a bidet as a thing, as a product, as an invention that I know long term, you'll love it.
[123:33.79]Okay.
[123:35.48]I'm game.
[123:37.73]Next time you're in Vegas, give me a shot.
[123:39.39]We'll go buy a bidet.
[123:41.53]Next time, I'm going to fly with it.
[123:44.37]I'm going to have it in hand.
[123:45.28]You're going to travel with a bidet?
[123:47.12]I'm going to travel.
[123:47.88]I've done this before.
[123:48.84]You're laughing.
[123:49.36]I've done this.
[123:50.56]I went to Texas to deliver my friend Jay Schlatt a bidet.
[123:57.77]And I set it up for him.
[123:58.99]Do you have to check that?
[124:00.01]Is that like, do you carry it like in a backpack and put it up with the luggage?
[124:03.10]Yeah, I had to check that.
[124:04.46]They had to have the whole conversation.
[124:07.00]They weighed it, they put it in, put the little ticker on it.
[124:10.04]Why am I imagining you setting the bidet up in the airplane bathroom?
[124:13.98]Because you like it and you want one in there.
[124:17.08]Yeah, I just have like an extra everywhere I go that's just like a quick place just in case.
[124:22.22]Yeah, you got to set it up and you have to use it there.
[124:24.78]Do you know the movie Pursuit of Happiness with Will Ferrell?
[124:29.81]Wait, Will Ferrell did this in a movie.
[124:31.37]Oh, excuse me.
[124:32.55]Will Smith.
[124:33.03]Will Smith.
[124:33.45]Oh, shit.
[124:33.67]I thought you were going to tell me Will Ferrell put a bidet in an airplane bathroom and had a drink.
[124:37.89]No, no, no.
[124:38.39]I'm talking about Pursuit of Happiness with Will Smith, where he buys all these medical equipments and he has to sell them.
[124:46.37]You know that movie?
[124:47.83]I think I've heard of it.
[124:49.97]Basically, he goes into debt because he buys all these medical equipments and he has to go door to door to every hospital to sell them.
[124:56.62]That's me with bidets.
[124:58.12]I've put my net worth into this product and now I'm just desperately trying to sell them.
[125:03.62]Just going door to door trying to get people.
[125:06.57]People got to buy these bidets.
[125:09.01]Yeah.
[125:09.53]You have so many of them.
[125:11.47]Yeah.
[125:11.99]It's like floor to ceiling.
[125:14.23]My girlfriend's pissed.
[125:15.31]She can barely walk into the bedroom because there's so many bidets.
[125:18.59]Hey, but it's a long-term strategy.
[125:20.22]Long-term strategy.
[125:21.20]You'll make 10% on each one.
[125:22.60]That's what I'm telling her.
[125:24.00]We're gonna make 10x if you just wait, alright?
[125:26.16]Yeah, for now, we have bidets everywhere around the house, but soon, we'll just have millions in an entire country adapted to the world of bidets.
[125:34.46]Put them on your sink, dude.
[125:35.66]Put them on every sink.
[125:37.18]Instead of a Brita, it's just a bidet that you drink from.
[125:42.62]That's fucking gross, but it's not even.
[125:44.21]It's just like a piece of metal that shoots water.
[125:45.67]Like, it could shoot it in your mouth or your eyes.
[125:46.83]It's not gross at all.
[125:47.63]Whatever.
[125:48.49]It's 0% gross.
[125:49.79]Because it doesn't, you know, I mean, the first, drinking out of a bidet on the first spray, that's, that's, but anything, it's more hygienic.
[125:57.77]You know, 50 sprays in, we got some problems.
[125:59.81]I'm telling you, I'm telling you, after day one, I ain't not drinking out of a bidet.
[126:03.85]I'm not doing that.
[126:04.97]That's fair.
[126:05.47]But day zero, you'd be like, yeah, it's just, you know.
[126:08.13]Okay, I don't want to stay on bidet for a million years, but I have another question.
[126:12.03]Yeah, please.
[126:12.79]Oh, fuck.
[126:13.51]Alright.
[126:14.47]I've,
[126:16.94]Where is the nozzle?
[126:17.88]Do you shit on the nozzle?
[126:19.83]How is it pointed angled to not get pissed and pooped on?
[126:24.31]There are two nozzles, and they retract.
[126:27.84]What do you mean?
[126:28.70]Like landing gear in a plane?
[126:30.48]Yeah, exactly like a landing gear in a plane.
[126:32.40]You can literally see it retract.
[126:35.62]What?
[126:36.70]Yeah, it goes into itself, and then to clean itself, it will spray where it retracts to.
[126:43.11]Think of it as like an enclosure, and it'll just ricochet off of like its enclosure to clean itself.
[126:51.05]What?
[126:52.67]This is, I'm telling you, the technology exists.
[126:55.25]You just don't know about it yet.
[126:59.09]I don't know, man.
[126:59.73]I know this is freaking me out, but I'll try it.
[127:01.61]I'll do it.
[127:03.39]You'll do it?
[127:04.15]It'll be great.
[127:05.58]I'm looking forward to it.
[127:06.62]Let's do it.
[127:09.50]Bidet stream.
[127:10.62]Well, no, no, no.
[127:11.18]Like, bidet, like, we build it.
[127:12.44]No.
[127:13.30]Forget everything I just said.
[127:14.67]Bidet vlog.
[127:15.91]Sure, yeah.
[127:17.05]Definitely pre-recorded.
[127:18.55]Yeah, definitely need some editing.
[127:23.91]Um... Uh, alright.
[127:25.19]What's the wager here?
[127:26.75]What's the wager here?
[127:27.87]I don't... Alright.
[127:30.99]How about...
[127:33.16]Okay.
[127:34.64]How are you feeling, by the way?
[127:35.62]You good?
[127:35.96]You still having fun with Battleship?
[127:38.20]I'm feeling phenomenal.
[127:39.00]I'm happy to switch gears at any time.
[127:40.48]I'm so easy.
[127:41.87]I'm easy.
[127:42.69]Okay.
[127:43.41]There apparently is like an advanced super mode.
[127:46.47]You want to try that right now?
[127:48.23]You want to try the advanced mode?
[127:49.85]I'm happy to try the advanced mode.
[127:51.07]I did see that.
[127:51.69]I didn't know what it meant.
[127:52.43]I don't know things, so I'm scared of them.
[127:54.83]How about we speedrun this one?
[127:55.88]Let's do one speedrun round.
[127:57.82]Well, you cannot take more than two seconds to click on a space.
[128:01.69]Alright.
[128:02.13]Alright.
[128:02.49]How about, how about also every ship has to connect in some manner.
[128:07.22]Sure.
[128:07.38]Alright.
[128:08.88]Every ship has to connect and you have to take, you can now take more than two seconds to click.
[128:13.28]Corner connecting is fine.
[128:14.58]Okay.
[128:24.19]That should be good.
[128:30.39]Shit, I don't know.
[128:31.11]This is way more complicated than I thought it was.
[128:33.31]Yeah, I... I find myself struggling a bit here.
[128:38.11]It's actually a pretty good lineup.
[128:43.27]No, I'm not going to do F again.
[128:45.00]Why would I do that?
[128:47.52]I think you might be mind-tricking me here.
[128:51.94]No, I was just doing it.
[128:53.34]I was just moving ships around to make it an F. What a terrible design.
[129:03.31]The design was so much better than this.
[129:10.13]Why does it look so fucking wrong?
[129:16.27]Is this supposed to... Why does it look wrong?
[129:23.26]It's not bad.
[129:24.16]You can't look wrong.
[129:24.98]You can't do battleship wrong.
[129:27.26]No, but I'm trying to... I'm connecting them wrong.
[129:32.60]Got him already.
[129:35.62]Oh.
[129:41.88]Two seconds.
[129:43.56]Oh, shit, shit.
[129:45.84]Oh my god.
[129:53.50]What?
[129:53.66]How are you not going down?
[129:56.20]Oh, we didn't even bet anything.
[129:57.30]We didn't bet anything.
[129:58.49]Oh, yeah.
[129:58.81]We just said speed around so we could get to the other thing.
[130:00.85]That's right.
[130:01.93]Let's just do a very casual, very breezy one gifted sub.
[130:09.66]Okay.
[130:14.92]Left.
[130:15.18]Oh, sunk.
[130:16.26]Alright, so it has to connect in some way, which...
[130:21.99]That makes this game somewhat easy.
[130:23.39]Corners can connect too, right?
[130:25.27]Yeah, yeah.
[130:25.59]Corners connect.
[130:26.15]There's nothing on the line.
[130:33.91]You're going to win this.
[130:34.55]I misclicked.
[130:35.66]I literally misclicked.
[130:36.58]I don't actually think I win this one.
[130:39.76]I think you do.
[130:42.86]Give me that one sub.
[130:45.98]Oh, it's connected.
[130:46.80]I actually would feel bad for you if you won this.
[130:51.08]Because you'd just be winning all the low stakes matches for $80.
[130:56.08]At least I got to participate.
[130:57.74]It was fun.
[131:01.27]Oh, you went corner.
[131:02.63]You did.
[131:03.01]I did go corner.
[131:04.09]Well, I went a bit corner.
[131:08.25]You went adjacent.
[131:09.55]You did.
[131:16.29]Oh, no.
[131:16.65]Is this your destroyer?
[131:18.31]Okay.
[131:21.25]Alright.
[131:22.93]How would you have connected this?
[131:24.39]I think a corner.
[131:26.15]There we are.
[131:31.05]Oh, you just made the letter I. I think you might have made a perfect letter I. What did you do, though?
[131:44.37]I went for a more refined strategy.
[131:46.81]Yeah, this seems pretty refined.
[131:49.86]I wasn't thinking the letter L or anything.
[131:53.00]Oh, shit.
[131:53.36]You didn't do that.
[131:54.01]Okay.
[131:58.65]So it must be here.
[132:01.11]Is there four?
[132:03.19]Now the question is, you have what?
[132:05.53]Oh, no.
[132:08.81]Oh, no.
[132:11.21]Wait.
[132:11.59]Okay.
[132:12.55]Is it continued down here?
[132:15.39]It is.
[132:15.81]It's a letter I. It's the letter I. You just made the letter I. It's the letter J. I just did it wrong.
[132:21.02]Wait.
[132:21.60]Yeah, you didn't do the letter J. That's supposed to be the letter J. Right.
[132:26.42]Alright.
[132:26.68]For Jerma.
[132:27.46]Mm-hmm.
[132:29.14]Oh, look at how refined that is.
[132:30.84]Look at how good that is.
[132:31.52]I went for... At first, I just did a really, like, a cross, and I was like, no, I've done this.
[132:37.48]Alright, well, it was low stakes.
[132:39.80]It was just a gifted, so that's fine.
[132:41.28]Yeah, it's just a gifted.
[132:42.26]It's alright.
[132:42.70]And on top of the 101 gifted subs.
[132:45.86]Actually, 96.
[132:46.48]I owe you five from our side bet.
[132:48.36]Oh, that's right.
[132:50.30]Okay, I'm going to create one.
[132:52.00]It says commanders.
[132:53.66]Whoa.
[132:54.44]Yeah, there's another game mode.
[132:57.15]There's, like, different maps.
[133:00.82]Let's do one of the wacky ones.
[133:02.42]Yeah, we're gonna play at... Oh, I can purchase this.
[133:07.84]We can play at... You're gonna buy it?
[133:10.40]Yeah, I'm gonna buy it.
[133:12.16]I can buy the White Cliffs of Dover or the Colossus Bay.
[133:17.13]Colossus Bay.
[133:18.41]Yeah, that's... I think so.
[133:24.03]Somebody keeps saying, don't bet on Jerma.
[133:25.39]He sucks.
[133:25.57]He sucks.
[133:27.34]Well, I mean, look, sometimes you get into a streak, and I was on a winning streak in the beginning, and now he's on a winning streak.
[133:33.15]You were hot for a minute, but it can come back.
[133:38.75]Okay.
[133:39.05]Alright, you got a code?
[133:40.09]I'm sending you the code.
[133:42.63]I opened up our Discord.
[133:43.71]This is your ass.
[133:46.09]Yeah, we need to clear that up.
[133:47.63]It's just written on your ass.
[133:50.78]So here's the thing.
[133:52.74]The boats are not all shaped like boats in this one.
[133:56.88]Wait, what?
[133:58.24]Are you seeing this?
[133:59.02]Yeah, this is weird.
[133:59.64]Hold on.
[134:00.16]I think you can show now.
[134:02.81]But yeah, they're not all like... Well, this is weird.
[134:06.77]This is different.
[134:07.55]This is like a different arena too.
[134:09.67]Do you think there are advantages for different commanders?
[134:12.03]Should we do a clone war here?
[134:14.49]Torpedo, airstrike, bombardment, projectiles, surgical strike.
[134:21.50]What does this mean?
[134:22.82]I don't know what salvo means.
[134:23.88]I've never even heard of that.
[134:25.45]Salvo is like a four or five, like six, like kind of spread out shooting a missile.
[134:32.87]I'm going to try this.
[134:33.77]I think we have nearly the same.
[134:35.71]We'll have to remember the shapes here.
[134:37.52]Yours seems really bad, though.
[134:38.68]I'm not going to lie.
[134:39.40]Are you happy with that?
[134:41.00]Oh, maybe not.
[134:42.10]Look at the far right.
[134:42.86]It's just a giant four.
[134:46.42]Yeah, this is... I'm happier with this guy, but maybe he has a better... I'm gonna go with this guy because he's got Torpedo.
[134:52.25]Alright, alright.
[134:52.87]I'm gonna go with Sir Philip Wade.
[134:54.37]He's been doing me well.
[134:55.37]Oh, pay to win.
[134:56.19]This is pay to win now.
[134:59.27]Shit, do I have to buy these?
[135:03.15]Abilities.
[135:04.81]Mine, sonar, bomb, torpedo.
[135:10.19]What I'm seeing is that it's almost like set up to make me put these really beautifully in the corners.
[135:17.19]Do you get that urge?
[135:18.35]I do have this urge to kind of Tetris this.
[135:20.59]Yeah.
[135:21.53]And it's the worst idea possible.
[135:31.94]I'm happy with that.
[135:34.26]I almost think it's... It's not.
[135:39.00]What if I do something like this would be a little silly, huh?
[135:46.11]I'm happy with this.
[135:48.03]I feel good about where I'm at.
[135:53.71]So what decides if we get to use our abilities?
[135:56.65]I have no idea how any of it works, but I guess we'll see.
[136:00.32]I'm starting us off.
[136:01.18]What's our bet?
[136:01.76]What's our wager?
[136:03.08]Another tweet.
[136:04.50]Okay.
[136:04.90]Oh, whoa.
[136:06.85]Is this a double or nothing in the sense that your other tweets like gone or how do you want to do it?
[136:12.01]No, no, no.
[136:12.31]Just for another one.
[136:13.57]Just a second tweet.
[136:14.40]Okay.
[136:14.74]Alright.
[136:15.14]Interesting.
[136:15.74]Interesting.
[136:17.48]This is weird.
[136:19.48]Alright.
[136:19.78]I have a single shot.
[136:21.78]I got two lightning bolts.
[136:23.00]What do you mean you got two lightning bolts?
[136:26.65]What is going on?
[136:27.31]I don't know.
[136:29.23]There's like abilities.
[136:30.03]I don't know what's going on here.
[136:32.07]It gave me two lightning when I
[136:36.20]What did I do?
[136:36.74]You just dropped a mine.
[136:38.98]What does that do?
[136:39.84]I don't know.
[136:41.40]Maybe if I click on it, it hurts me.
[136:43.62]Do you know where my mine is?
[136:45.26]No, I have no idea.
[136:47.03]Okay.
[136:47.47]I was going to shoot it.
[136:48.11]That would have been a giveaway.
[136:51.51]I thought that was a mine.
[136:52.43]Okay.
[136:53.47]No, no, no.
[136:54.19]I put my mine somewhere.
[136:56.09]I guess you get ability points per turn.
[136:59.03]Oh, alright.
[137:00.36]I get it.
[137:04.78]Oh, it shows you the pieces.
[137:08.76]Oh, I get it.
[137:09.14]Okay, yeah, yeah.
[137:11.43]And I place a mine.
[137:13.89]But I can also just not do anything.
[137:16.07]And I think I save... Oh.
[137:18.97]Did you tuck it in?
[137:20.07]Wait, that gave me a lightning bolt, by the way.
[137:23.55]If you can still afford some abilities, you can choose to save him.
[137:26.66]No, I'm going to save my mine.
[137:28.90]Wait, I should mine where my ship is, right?
[137:30.88]Presumably.
[137:33.60]Presumably.
[137:38.91]You know what?
[137:40.07]Oh, whoa.
[137:42.33]What?
[137:43.25]You bombs away?
[137:44.67]And I didn't hit anything.
[137:46.21]You don't have anything in that side?
[137:47.46]It was a whiff.
[137:49.16]No, not to say I have nothing over there.
[137:50.74]You should keep your forces.
[137:52.92]Keep your forces on the left.
[137:53.96]You just missed.
[137:54.64]You're close.
[137:59.96]Alright.
[138:00.34]I'm just trying to reverse psychology you.
[138:02.08]Alright.
[138:02.48]Alright.
[138:02.84]So where is it?
[138:03.46]Where is this fucking scumbag?
[138:06.66]Alright.
[138:08.18]Okay.
[138:12.18]So I have so many points.
[138:13.62]What does this do?
[138:15.06]Oh, you used five points.
[138:16.38]I'm going to save up for my maximum.
[138:20.22]Surely you went to the right here like you do.
[138:22.34]No.
[138:24.38]Damn it.
[138:27.20]Alright.
[138:27.40]So I have to be careful because now you have like a super bomb now, don't you?
[138:30.89]Whatever your like ultimate ability is.
[138:32.69]Yeah.
[138:33.15]I don't know what it is.
[138:34.13]It's my salvo or whatever.
[138:36.87]And you're feeding me right now.
[138:39.96]I have a few.
[138:40.70]Okay, you have... This still could... Oh my god, how did you know?
[138:44.36]I just figured it would be... Oh wait, that's not even that one.
[138:46.46]Which one is this one then?
[138:47.34]No, it's not.
[138:47.90]It's the other one.
[138:49.40]What?
[138:50.42]Oh, alright.
[138:51.08]Alright, that's big for me.
[138:55.52]Okay, so you're just presumably... Wait, what does this do?
[139:02.81]Does it just shoot?
[139:05.13]Hold up, hold up.
[139:05.89]Let me do this.
[139:10.78]oh nothing you have goes this should probably be down here no yeah oh what is this is it a square one oh it is so where does this go maybe here it's actually a lot harder because there could be so many places where the tails can be alright let's let's try this oh oh wait
[139:40.73]Somebody said, use your Q. I'm actually kind of scared.
[139:46.04]Are you about to drop a nuke on here?
[139:48.14]Oh, what the fuck?
[139:52.63]You actually got it.
[139:53.99]Yeah, well, because it could have only been there, right?
[139:56.57]Because if you flip it, it'll be the other direction.
[139:58.70]And I can also do this.
[140:06.29]What is that?
[140:06.75]What did you just do?
[140:07.37]What does that do?
[140:08.01]I just, I sonar checked and I think there are two, there's two ships in that area.
[140:16.79]Zero color, zero, zero torpedo fired across a row or a column.
[140:20.25]It stops when it hits a ship.
[140:22.63]What?
[140:24.11]What?
[140:28.11]Oh shit.
[140:28.69]That's awesome.
[140:30.19]That's the best ability I've ever seen.
[140:36.65]I wish I... What do I do with this?
[140:39.03]Well, now you know that there's a ship there.
[140:40.97]No, I just put a mine down.
[140:43.36]Oh, you put a mine down?
[140:44.22]I put a mine down as well.
[140:45.22]I don't know what happens.
[140:46.08]I assume when you hit it, it just ends your turn.
[140:48.08]Alright, so there's two...
[140:52.91]This is kind of cool.
[140:54.53]Area?
[140:55.47]This is amazing, yeah.
[140:56.48]I think it has to be here.
[140:58.64]Yeah, and then probably down, no?
[141:02.64]No, to the right it must have been.
[141:04.90]I know you've got points.
[141:07.00]Let me do one of... I think I might... Oh, you can't do that.
[141:16.74]Okay, I thought you... Okay.
[141:20.83]What if I put something...
[141:28.59]You know what?
[141:29.35]I was talking a lot of shit.
[141:31.97]Jerma, this could be meta.
[141:35.35]You think it is?
[141:35.89]Oh, nice.
[141:37.20]It's your little one.
[141:38.32]There's going to be like a character tier list.
[141:44.50]You have two small ones.
[141:45.78]You have two twos.
[141:46.92]What?
[141:47.42]I have two twos.
[141:48.20]Yeah, I don't know if that's like because I paid for this character and I'm paying to win.
[141:51.20]Oh, fuck.
[141:53.18]alright alright you must have some points built up no oh I got four okay uh presumably it's here yeah alright yeah yeah yeah I sunk your little guy that's got the little guy that's big uh you also have another little guy oh I do you're right yeah this is fair let's uh let's oh let's scan this this is a big area
[142:18.07]Oh, someone's in here.
[142:19.81]But just on the outskirts of it.
[142:21.97]So probably here.
[142:24.47]Must have been on the right.
[142:26.25]Alright, what do I got?
[142:26.87]Come on.
[142:28.91]And there's a comeback mechanic because every time you get shot, you just get a point.
[142:31.68]I can go.
[142:37.16]Oh, no.
[142:38.60]Alright, what do you got?
[142:41.14]Twos?
[142:42.32]I have quite a few.
[142:43.80]Alright, so what do you got left?
[142:45.28]This one could go...
[142:47.79]This one can continue.
[142:48.79]I think it's this one.
[142:50.13]No, I already got that one.
[142:51.61]No, I didn't.
[142:52.37]Oh, fuck.
[142:52.97]I did already get that one.
[142:54.03]Oops.
[142:54.31]What's funny is you just gave up on another ship.
[142:57.64]I thought it was the three one, but I already got the three one.
[142:59.44]I'm an idiot.
[143:00.48]Yeah.
[143:02.74]Okay.
[143:03.78]No, that wasn't the three one.
[143:05.34]Oops.
[143:05.56]Not yet.
[143:05.90]Okay.
[143:07.65]No.
[143:10.81]Wait, I can just do... I can do this.
[143:14.74]no sure but where is this ship yes there's only one inside my sonar area I'm painting a picture around this ship aren't I maybe wait I think the torpedo might be one of the greatest is it this oh yeah it's it's my weird I don't even know what to call that
[143:40.79]Alright, I gotta be careful here.
[143:41.97]I keep using my big one.
[143:43.95]I don't want to use the big one again.
[143:46.71]So you got another two.
[143:47.51]It's probably here.
[143:48.09]Nope.
[143:52.27]Oh, I'm saving points.
[143:54.17]Okay, alright.
[143:55.11]I think that's a good strategy.
[143:57.75]So you either have your two jutting out to the right.
[144:03.14]Oh my god.
[144:03.76]There's only one spot now.
[144:05.26]You have like ten points now, don't you?
[144:07.96]I have four.
[144:09.29]I've been using my sonar.
[144:10.43]That's why I know there's a ship up here.
[144:15.03]I also have a couple of mines just lingering.
[144:22.23]What?
[144:23.59]Where is this one going?
[144:24.85]Straight?
[144:28.71]Okay.
[144:29.49]I'm saving up my points here.
[144:30.73]This is a hit.
[144:31.86]There we go.
[144:32.56]Finally.
[144:33.20]It must be down.
[144:34.88]Into the left.
[144:38.87]Wait, how does this work?
[144:41.37]If it flips, it's the same.
[144:43.09]So this can only go to the left.
[144:45.72]Right, okay.
[144:47.62]Alright.
[144:48.72]You got it.
[144:49.70]You got it.
[144:51.20]This other ship, it's able to sneak in weird areas.
[144:55.30]Let me try the barrage.
[145:01.57]You have a barrage?
[145:02.67]You have enough points for that?
[145:04.37]Oh, let me tell you, I got barrage points over here.
[145:08.68]You think we're not barraging?
[145:09.94]You're out of your mind.
[145:20.44]Oh, come on.
[145:21.24]That one's good.
[145:22.86]It must be right or left?
[145:25.87]Left.
[145:29.13]And then it has to go up.
[145:35.39]I'm gonna be able to like... You built... I have so many points now.
[145:41.20]Alright, I need to win quick.
[145:42.84]I'm a little nervous.
[145:43.88]You only have a two.
[145:46.88]Bitch.
[145:47.42]Alright, let's just clear this.
[145:49.44]Alright.
[145:52.59]Alright.
[145:53.05]I gotta make something happen here.
[145:55.37]Your torpedo is just such a weapon.
[145:59.35]Well, you gotta clean up your food first.
[146:05.13]yep oh no okay no it's not it's not worth using this um wait can I not move where can I oh I get it okay oh no
[146:29.31]What?
[146:29.47]What do you mean one?
[146:30.75]One?
[146:31.01]Only one.
[146:31.63]Only one.
[146:31.99]It doesn't make any sense.
[146:33.51]One?
[146:33.61]It makes a lot of sense if you think about it.
[146:35.14]No way.
[146:35.56]Not too hard though.
[146:36.30]Well, come on.
[146:36.98]I have a two left.
[146:38.92]Oh, I thought it was counting that one as the one.
[146:41.12]No, no, no, no.
[146:44.98]Sonar there was a little crazy because you knew it was connected.
[146:47.14]Yeah, but I thought there would be something over here too.
[146:49.32]Right.
[146:49.64]That makes sense.
[146:52.08]I like that you can only sonar where you shoot.
[146:57.97]Well, that's not the... What are you talking about?
[147:01.01]I don't get... I thought it was the one that was up and left.
[147:05.53]Oh.
[147:06.59]Oh, fuck.
[147:08.59]You have one fatal flaw right now.
[147:11.81]And it's that you have started ships and then just quit on them.
[147:15.35]Yeah, but I don't want to give you the points.
[147:16.77]I know where those are.
[147:19.51]Oh.
[147:20.91]If I hit, you get a point.
[147:23.15]Oh, yeah.
[147:23.59]You're absolutely right.
[147:24.49]I do.
[147:27.35]Oh.
[147:32.31]I only shot that so I could sonar it.
[147:34.40]Alright, let's... How do I do that?
[147:42.50]I just want to... I want to metal with your... Let's see what happens here.
[147:56.86]Where should I put this?
[147:59.42]I can win this right now if I actually do this correct.
[148:03.48]So you've got... You've got a two left.
[148:08.94]You've got a three, which is either... Hold on, cancel this.
[148:13.61]It's either here or here.
[148:17.05]Wait, no, it'd have to be... I flipped that.
[148:21.77]It has to be here.
[148:25.58]I have to be right there.
[148:26.48]Oh, shit.
[148:27.34]I'm stupid.
[148:28.24]Two tweets.
[148:29.28]What are you talking about, two tweets?
[148:30.98]I'm gonna win right now.
[148:31.92]I just think it's gonna take me a minute.
[148:40.25]Wait, why does it say that?
[148:41.43]Hold on.
[148:43.09]What is this one, then?
[148:45.79]Is this one... There's still a two hanging out somewhere.
[148:48.53]It's this three one or this four one?
[148:50.56]One, two, three, four.
[148:54.35]I think I got it.
[148:54.76]1, 2, 3, 4.
[148:55.50]That's the only thing it could be.
[148:57.62]It couldn't be anything else.
[148:58.33]It has to be here.
[148:59.39]Has to be.
[149:00.21]It has to be here.
[149:34.51]It's the end of your turn?
[149:37.40]You got three choices here.
[149:42.54]I don't think I have that few.
[149:46.74]No!
[149:47.28]What?
[149:47.74]What do you mean?
[149:48.30]You get to drop a bomb?
[149:50.08]How does that work?
[149:50.73]I dropped a bomb.
[149:51.75]I hit your mind.
[149:52.41]Is that fine?
[149:54.29]Oh, it's fine.
[149:55.07]I think it just ends your turn automatically.
[149:57.63]Oh!
[149:58.37]Oh, it went that way.
[149:59.41]I thought it was...
[150:01.97]Oh my god.
[150:02.63]I think this is a great game mode.
[150:08.48]Jerma, I've thought of the tweet.
[150:14.10]I'm actually very confident on this one.
[150:16.88]I have to fucking win a game here.
[150:19.48]You want to hear my idea?
[150:20.59]What's the idea?
[150:21.51]Let's hear it.
[150:23.25]It's a combination.
[150:25.01]I had that one too.
[150:26.17]I just went the... You actually got every ship tagged?
[150:29.73]It was just the wrong direction, yeah.
[150:33.23]Alright, what's the idea?
[150:33.91]Let's hear it.
[150:35.07]Well... Right now... I have to... I get one tweet, and I also get a shirt.
[150:42.24]Yeah, you do.
[150:43.30]You do get a shirt.
[150:45.46]So we could combine the two feasibly.
[150:49.16]Where you wear a shirt, and you have to tweet it out.
[150:52.66]Oh god.
[150:55.02]And when I went to the bathroom earlier, I actually did a bit of research.
[150:59.46]And I'm really fond...
[151:01.81]of this new merch company I found called Megamilk.
[151:10.39]So I thought it'd be apt to get you a Megamilk shirt and then have you tweet it out.
[151:16.74]Is this part of the almond thing?
[151:18.28]No, because it's two tweets now.
[151:21.52]The almond thing is totally separate.
[151:24.12]Yeah, you just wanted a second.
[151:25.54]It wasn't even just a second tweet.
[151:33.06]A sex Twitter.
[151:34.68]Yeah, you're going to have to change it to 18 plus.
[151:39.16]Let's go.
[151:40.38]I'm trying as hard as I can for this one.
[151:42.03]I am going to pull out all the stops for this one.
[151:45.91]I'm going to try someone new, I think.
[151:47.53]Because I like the different strategies.
[151:51.31]I'm going to try... We did... Gamblers always lose.
[151:58.65]He's a gambler too.
[151:59.75]And he's winning over and over.
[152:01.02]Damn.
[152:02.33]Gamblers lose as long as I keep sitting here.
[152:04.09]I'll lose eventually.
[152:05.61]He just has the spatial awareness that I don't have.
[152:09.75]I'm going to try William Cars Lake.
[152:15.11]Alright.
[152:15.51]What are we doing here?
[152:16.13]What for this one?
[152:16.89]Yeah.
[152:17.55]We got to.
[152:19.95]I'm open.
[152:20.41]Look, you're the one who's down the most right now.
[152:22.95]So I think it's only fair that you set the wager where you want to.
[152:27.85]How about if I win, I get to remove the Mega Milk shirt tweet?
[152:33.21]okay and hand it over to you you want me to tweet mega milk yeah you would have to tweet the mega milk shirt I think that's reasonable but you understand that you're gambling here that this is a more than a double or nothing what happens if I win what do you say you're getting rid of the tweet do you are you getting rid of the shirt as well
[152:55.11]No.
[152:56.23]I will still wear that shirt.
[152:57.99]But that's not, we don't know that.
[152:59.01]We're not positive that's the shirt yet.
[153:01.51]Right.
[153:01.91]Okay.
[153:03.29]I would agree with you that if I didn't have the tweet, I'd probably pick a different shirt.
[153:08.74]I don't want to flood your Twitter.
[153:10.06]This is going to be like five tweets in a row of like different weird things I'm doing.
[153:16.10]Yeah.
[153:16.56]It would just be just insanely.
[153:18.56]Alright.
[153:19.68]No.
[153:19.88]Okay.
[153:20.12]So you reverse it.
[153:20.86]You're just saying no you.
[153:23.31]But if I win, because I've already earned the shirt and the tweet.
[153:35.90]Give me just a moment.
[153:37.66]I have to think.
[153:38.24]This is difficult in a way.
[153:39.70]I don't like these shapes.
[153:48.17]Think what would be equivalent to that in my mind because it's a full reversal is I would need For you to get a full cat boy costume Yeah tweet a picture in this cat made costume I
[154:19.29]Something to the effect of... I'm having a good time right meow.
[154:30.60]Fuck.
[154:32.88]So I'm removing the last tweet and giving you the Mega Milk tweet.
[154:37.61]But if I lose, I have to.
[154:40.43]Let's just make sure I get this correct.
[154:42.99]I have to tweet a picture of me holding my stomach talking about almonds.
[154:45.81]I love eating almonds till I throw up.
[154:47.63]And then I have to tweet a picture of me in a Mega Milk shirt in the bathroom.
[154:50.83]Like I was using the bidet or something.
[154:52.98]Sure, yeah.
[154:53.58]And then I have to tweet a picture of me in a Catboy maid outfit saying I'm having a good time right meow.
[154:58.02]That's what I stand to lose.
[155:00.24]Yeah, because you have to understand this.
[155:02.86]When you say you're getting rid of yours and reflecting it on me, it's like twofold, right?
[155:06.92]It's true.
[155:07.26]It's almost like right now you owe me $100.
[155:09.14]We'll just translate it to money, and then I'm going to owe you $100.
[155:12.24]It's a $200 swing.
[155:12.68]I would rather pay you $1,000 right now.
[155:14.56]Well, money.
[155:14.88]Money has no effect here.
[155:16.72]Fuck.
[155:26.65]I'm in.
[155:27.83]You're in?
[155:28.33]Wait, no, no, no.
[155:28.89]I'm not in.
[155:29.31]Hold on.
[155:29.81]I want to make sure this is a good placement.
[155:32.07]Yeah, I'm in.
[155:37.15]I'm in.
[155:38.65]You're sure about this?
[155:41.77]Yes.
[155:42.97]Wait, wait.
[155:44.59]Sorry.
[155:45.15]You need to... I pulled up your stream instinctively to see how your chat felt about that, and I just saw one of your ship's placements on the bottom.
[155:53.92]You should change your ships.
[155:56.35]I just accidentally cheated.
[155:57.83]Okay.
[155:59.74]I'm sorry.
[156:00.86]You might have been happy.
[156:01.44]I close it out.
[156:02.02]I close it out.
[156:02.58]I just wanted to see what they thought about the cat boy.
[156:04.82]But what if that was the game winner?
[156:06.18]What if that was the one?
[156:06.88]What if that was the game winner?
[156:08.74]It's Battleship.
[156:09.64]That could have been the game winner.
[156:10.97]It's not the game winner.
[156:12.29]That was the game winner.
[156:13.11]That could have been the game winner.
[156:13.93]It was not the game winner.
[156:14.95]I think I deserve you eating an almond for a tweet.
[156:17.97]I'll eat an almond for a tweet on the house.
[156:19.79]Yeah, that's fair.
[156:20.39]Because you got the game winner.
[156:28.41]I should have left it.
[156:30.05]Then you never would have clicked on those spaces.
[156:32.18]You can still do all of that.
[156:34.06]I don't know.
[156:41.24]I'm not ready.
[156:42.26]Oh, my God.
[156:42.72]I feel like I'm doing my hair in the mirror, and it's just not... I don't like it.
[156:48.14]I actually love my ship's placement right now.
[156:54.66]Alright.
[156:54.90]Let's go.
[156:56.62]Alright.
[156:56.97]Alright.
[156:58.60]You still have Torpedo Man?
[157:00.42]I chose a different person.
[157:02.02]I chose Airstrike.
[157:02.80]Oh, you did?
[157:04.14]Oh, wait.
[157:04.40]We have the same man.
[157:06.28]Oh, this is a mirror.
[157:07.05]This is perfect.
[157:07.55]Okay.
[157:08.53]Oh, it's a nine?
[157:10.51]Was it nine for the torpedo?
[157:12.83]No, it was like six.
[157:15.89]Okay.
[157:16.57]Off rip.
[157:17.72]Let's make this play.
[157:20.60]No.
[157:21.42]Should save my money.
[157:23.32]Nope.
[157:28.34]It must be going up, right?
[157:30.30]Oh, I thought you would have.
[157:32.41]Okay.
[157:32.63]Alright.
[157:44.79]Oh, brutal.
[157:46.21]Oh, brutal.
[157:47.21]That is really bad for me.
[157:49.07]What a randomly placed ship, too, right?
[157:50.94]It's, you know, as isolated as it could have made it.
[157:54.76]Unfortunately, that's not going to help.
[157:58.12]Oh, no.
[157:58.78]Oh, my lord, Jerma, please.
[158:01.40]Please, I know you're down bad, but cheating?
[158:03.81]Really?
[158:04.13]Oh, no.
[158:05.69]Jerma, please.
[158:06.49]Oh, no, you're in trouble.
[158:08.88]Oh, no.
[158:09.70]Well, I'm getting points.
[158:10.78]I'm getting really rich.
[158:12.04]So here's the thing.
[158:12.70]My brain has to take a second to think about where this is.
[158:16.02]If it's that way, it's either... I mean, it could be anywhere, right?
[158:24.88]I think you're a cheeky fuck.
[158:27.30]Nope.
[158:28.98]There's so many places it could be.
[158:30.52]It's shocking.
[158:32.70]Okay, I am rich in points, though.
[158:36.71]Let's let's let's just do let's just chill.
[158:39.29]Let's just do this is if it is anything it could be the L shape But more realistically, I think this could be many things I Could secure the bag Let's oh yeah, yeah, let's do this because if it's the L shape it would be no it doesn't yeah Okay, it is the L shape What?
[159:08.00]God, you fucking got it.
[159:11.42]What did I get?
[159:12.86]You hit the wrong one.
[159:16.58]I went for the bottom of the L so I could sonar.
[159:19.40]Do I save my money for an airstrike?
[159:21.86]Okay, yeah, let me do this though.
[159:30.04]I've made a devious plot.
[159:37.80]So if it's this, then it has to be this way.
[159:46.12]Right?
[159:46.80]It has to be that way.
[159:47.56]It has to be.
[159:48.72]It has to be this way or this way.
[159:51.72]If it's that.
[159:52.38]Which I don't know if it's that or not.
[160:00.00]Or this could be the big L. I'm going to do something here.
[160:07.98]People might think this is insane.
[160:09.90]My God, don't do it.
[160:10.76]Come on.
[160:12.76]Okay.
[160:14.24]Alright.
[160:15.22]I have deduced what it is.
[160:17.58]What is it?
[160:17.96]I don't know.
[160:20.18]I think it's the L. It's the L. Oh, it is the L. Which way?
[160:38.83]he lives another day alright let's go okay I have uh I have an airstrike now fire at all cells what what does it do oh it's it's it's like the torpedo
[161:23.30]That is the most OP thing I've ever seen in my life.
[161:28.14]I gotta get one of those quick.
[161:31.32]I gotta get one of those right now.
[161:32.97]Damn it, damn it, damn it.
[161:35.87]First of all, let's make this...
[161:38.94]What?
[161:39.18]It's not the L. It's not the L?
[161:40.84]What are you talking about?
[161:42.51]It's not the L?
[161:43.41]What the hell is it then?
[161:44.23]It's this little guy.
[161:45.11]No, it's not.
[161:45.89]What the fuck is happening?
[161:47.03]It's this way.
[161:51.89]The airstrike is so OP.
[162:03.18]It's like a baby having a tantrum.
[162:09.06]Okay.
[162:09.22]Alright, let's just keep it simple here.
[162:17.20]So this two right here, does it go down?
[162:22.07]Or does it go, most likely here, right?
[162:26.17]Right, yeah.
[162:26.85]Which means this has to go up.
[162:31.99]And then that's, I'm giving you so many points.
[162:35.46]That's right.
[162:36.10]I think I've tagged every ship, so I just need to... I need to finish it out.
[162:41.54]Now, what is this one to the left?
[162:43.10]Down?
[162:43.48]Up?
[162:43.84]I don't know.
[162:45.16]My best odds are here, but it could be this one or this one.
[162:52.12]Oh, so that must be this one.
[162:54.54]What?
[162:55.62]Wait, how...
[162:57.21]Thank God.
[162:58.17]Oh, it's down there.
[163:00.61]You don't know where it is.
[163:01.29]You have no idea.
[163:02.54]It could be anywhere.
[163:04.34]I do know, though.
[163:05.82]I do.
[163:06.30]I do get it.
[163:06.84]I shouldn't.
[163:09.82]I shouldn't.
[163:10.28]I should do this.
[163:14.84]You must be flush with points right now.
[163:22.37]I am.
[163:24.45]I got to get the most amount of surface area here.
[163:31.22]Oh, I got one.
[163:32.16]That was your two.
[163:32.80]You just sunk it.
[163:35.72]You literally just sunk it.
[163:39.16]Oh, no.
[163:40.14]Oh, God.
[163:41.60]Okay.
[163:41.92]Alright.
[163:42.28]Alright.
[163:42.68]Alright.
[163:43.56]Alright.
[163:43.84]This is bad.
[163:44.92]This is now bad for me.
[163:47.74]Okay.
[163:49.12]Oh, you're in trouble here.
[163:50.94]But so am I. I am in a deep crock of shit.
[163:56.20]This could be literally any one of these, though.
[163:59.21]I only have two ships left.
[164:00.29]It can't be anything.
[164:01.20]I mean, it's either this way or that way.
[164:04.08]That is true.
[164:04.72]And I got it.
[164:06.08]Well, no, you didn't get it because there's a lot.
[164:08.33]There's a lot that it could be.
[164:09.35]That's right.
[164:11.91]There is a lot that it could be.
[164:15.79]Oh.
[164:16.59]Wait, that's physically not possible for it to be that way.
[164:23.10]What do you mean?
[164:23.62]Alright.
[164:27.60]Okay.
[164:31.22]So this, this, this has to be here.
[164:34.23]We know that.
[164:35.43]You do know that.
[164:36.05]Uh-huh.
[164:37.43]And so that, that leaves me with, oh wait, am I, am I still missing a ship?
[164:44.07]I still haven't tagged one ship.
[164:47.55]Oh no.
[164:56.64]This is so nerve wracking.
[164:57.92]It's too nerve wracking.
[164:59.44]This has to be left or right.
[165:14.10]I could put my poker face on.
[165:15.52]I don't know what to do.
[165:16.36]I'm just hiding from the camera.
[165:20.32]I think an airstrike here is a waste.
[165:26.77]At this stage of the game, the airstrike kind of...
[165:31.66]You son of a bitch.
[165:32.52]You son of a bitch.
[165:34.58]And it just ends?
[165:36.60]What happened?
[165:37.44]And you get two counter shots?
[165:39.96]What just happened?
[165:40.92]I don't know.
[165:41.48]I have no idea what just happened.
[165:42.46]I think since I hit it, you get two counter shots or something.
[165:44.88]I got two counter shots?
[165:46.75]Yeah.
[165:50.53]I wouldn't even pay attention.
[166:04.04]This tells me if it's a three or a two ship.
[166:07.24]Oh, it's a three ship.
[166:24.13]You have some dastardly two somewhere.
[166:50.14]No, you did not.
[166:51.16]No way.
[166:52.06]No way.
[166:53.34]No way you got that.
[166:54.94]This is impossible.
[166:56.30]It's not possible.
[166:58.22]It's impossible.
[166:59.60]Oh, my God.
[167:01.19]What?
[167:06.97]How did you get that?
[167:08.21]That was like a 4% chance to hit that one.
[167:11.07]What I do is I flick my mouse and I click.
[167:17.23]Oh my god, that was the most stressful game.
[167:24.33]Oh.
[167:26.97]Oh my god, what the fuck?
[167:29.67]That was insane.
[167:30.87]Oh my god.
[167:34.01]How do I even get anything shaved off of this?
[167:37.83]Look at your guy's face.
[167:39.17]He's so sullen.
[167:41.55]Oh, that's... This is... Okay, at this point, I almost own your Twitter account.
[167:53.68]know what to do about this I want to keep playing to try to like get some of this back yeah but I can't like I can't even win a game no okay you you know what you know what you could do
[168:07.97]We could make a... I owe you what?
[168:10.61]It's three tweets.
[168:12.35]It's three tweets, and I feel like a shit in a bag or whatever it was.
[168:16.03]What was it?
[168:17.29]Wear a shirt?
[168:17.83]You have to wear a shirt.
[168:20.53]It's three tweets.
[168:21.55]It's 96 subs.
[168:28.14]You know, at this point... I got $70.
[168:39.34]Okay.
[168:40.44]That's like the... Okay.
[168:41.78]This is what happens to the person that gets last place in Mario Party.
[168:45.39]You know what I mean?
[168:46.67]Oh, but at least we gave you fucking ten coins.
[168:49.23]Oh, yeah.
[168:49.81]Thanks.
[168:50.63]In the final five turns, they throw you a couple.
[168:55.46]Um...
[168:57.90]What do you feel in your heart?
[168:59.60]You want to win this back.
[169:00.46]I can't imagine.
[169:01.48]What to you is the worst thing that you owe?
[169:03.90]It's surely not the money.
[169:05.96]No.
[169:06.86]It's definitely the last one you just said.
[169:10.80]It's the cat made one.
[169:11.82]That one's tough.
[169:12.72]That one's tough.
[169:14.02]Probably the last two.
[169:15.03]The last two tweets are rough.
[169:18.61]But Twixt, the cat and the milk, which one is worse?
[169:22.45]Both equal.
[169:24.12]equally bad equally well I would have to get in an outfit and okay yeah no it's it's it's it's something it's it's surely something but how do we how do we even give you an incentive anymore you have won okay you just won you sat at the blackjack table with like 200 bucks and you have like 15 000 in chips like what do you care at this point I have I have my watch now yeah you have the watch like you don't even need to play you're like you're good
[169:49.87]This is, I know, I feel great.
[169:51.46]I feel great about this.
[169:53.10]But I am, I'm still a sucker for monetary investments, okay?
[170:00.08]So I'm willing to make you a wager.
[170:03.00]You're making me a wager?
[170:03.90]Okay, what's the wager?
[170:06.01]You, right now, owe me just a little under $500.
[170:10.33]Sure.
[170:10.61]Would you say that $500 is about how much...
[170:22.02]One of those tweets is worth... The Milk Boy's worth?
[170:28.84]Yeah, I would say so.
[170:30.06]I'd say $500 is probably what that would be worth for me, I think.
[170:34.37]Okay.
[170:35.81]Here's what I'm going to do.
[170:37.51]And you can decline this offer.
[170:38.89]Because I think I'm more... I'm willing to give up the Mega Milk shirt, tweet, and stream.
[170:44.81]I'm willing to give that up.
[170:46.38]Wow, okay.
[170:48.54]In exchange...
[170:51.04]You already owe me 500.
[170:53.64]Let's just say if you win, we'll just cut those.
[170:59.16]Alright?
[170:59.48]They're just eliminated.
[171:01.38]So the two tweets with the costumes?
[171:04.52]No, just... Well, let's not get in over our heads.
[171:07.26]I'm trying to rewrite the contract here.
[171:09.21]Just the Milk Boy tweet stream are gone.
[171:15.59]Okay?
[171:17.55]in exchange if if if that if you win okay alright if I win you still owe me all that but I need you because you live in Vegas to take a thousand dollars go to the casino and put it on black oh my god and if I win that bet you have to give me two thousand dollars
[171:43.83]It's a pretty good bet for you.
[171:45.34]I mean, that's a thousand bucks though.
[171:47.82]Well, you already owe me 500.
[171:48.86]It's more like... I know, I know.
[171:52.80]It's a $500 bet, basically.
[171:54.06]Is this worth $500 to potentially erase?
[171:57.74]Now, I will say, if you lose, you owe three tweets, one stream with a shirt on, cat made outfit, pregnant almond, milk boy.
[172:07.12]You have to give me $1,000, go to the casino with it, put it on a roulette table on black.
[172:12.83]It's a lot.
[172:18.95]Will you be willing to remove the cat maid outfit if we made this 1500?
[172:26.22]Wow!
[172:27.34]That's how bad the cat maid outfit is.
[172:30.42]Honestly, like, tweeting in general.
[172:34.03]It's like so, like, I...
[172:38.48]tweets themselves.
[172:40.08]Yeah.
[172:40.92]I could literally dress up in any costume, but I have to tweet.
[172:43.78]Like, fuck.
[172:45.18]The tweet is... Look, I would almost be creating enemies if I got rid of that for how just... I mean, look at your chat.
[172:53.11]They're fervorish about this.
[172:54.21]If I got rid of this, they...
[172:56.13]They would be riots.
[172:58.71]Hey, don't let them fool you.
[173:00.53]They already got that.
[173:01.53]Because you owe me $500.
[173:02.71]You're saying it's basically $1,000 on this game.
[173:06.83]And I will literally live cast it to you.
[173:11.71]I can't do that.
[173:14.03]I can take a picture before and after.
[173:15.97]And it's going to be like a picture of me.
[173:18.47]An audio experience.
[173:19.55]Just do like your phone recording.
[173:21.23]And you can just auditorily bring me through it.
[173:25.85]You know what?
[173:26.63]Look, I love Catboy, but I would never take away a man's opportunity to win back his dignity.
[173:35.19]Alright, so hold on.
[173:37.22]So this is all if you lose this.
[173:40.09]If I lose this, get rid of the cap.
[173:42.73]We are just going over what happens at the end of this game.
[173:46.01]So if you win this game, I have to do all of that.
[173:50.43]And I have to do the $1,500 on black.
[173:53.07]It's a lot.
[173:53.89]You have to do a lot.
[173:54.79]This is like an astronomical amount of stuff to do.
[173:58.43]It's an insane list of errands.
[173:59.87]It'll take you literally like weeks to accomplish everything.
[174:04.69]But if you win... And you wipe out the two tweets.
[174:11.04]You got to wipe out all three tweets.
[174:13.74]All three?
[174:14.64]No, actually, the Allman one can stay.
[174:17.27]I feel like there's so many terms to this contract, we have to write this down.
[174:26.81]Just to clarify, you win.
[174:30.13]You only have to go post the Allman boy tweet.
[174:34.90]Everything else is gone.
[174:37.38]Yes.
[174:39.39]If I win, it's three tweets.
[174:42.07]And hey, well, hold on.
[174:42.93]I'll sweeten the deal.
[174:43.77]I'll sweeten the deal for you.
[174:46.85]Even if I win, I'll sweeten the deal.
[174:50.59]You get rid of those two tweets, the cat made outfit one and the Mega Milk tweet.
[174:55.59]And I'll tell you right now, you delete those, I'll do $250 on black.
[174:59.69]Wait, $250?
[174:59.81]I'll do $250 on black.
[175:08.11]That's lower than... That's not sweeter.
[175:11.87]Oh, that sweetens the deal, because otherwise it would have been wiped out, and I wouldn't have to do it.
[175:15.61]Oh, you'll still do 250 on black.
[175:17.19]I'll still do 250.
[175:18.25]For me.
[175:19.01]Yeah.
[175:19.13]Does that sweeten it for you?
[175:27.72]I'm in.
[175:29.77]Ow.
[175:30.85]Alright, let's go.
[175:32.51]This is the final.
[175:33.75]We can't go past this, though, because after this, it's like the deed to your home.
[175:40.54]I'm going to start giving you titles to cars and stuff.
[175:44.56]This is the last one.
[175:45.50]Okay.
[175:45.82]Alright.
[175:46.40]Oh, gosh.
[175:47.66]I'm already nervous.
[175:48.88]I can feel a lump forming in my throat.
[175:53.04]Alright.
[175:53.88]I think I'm going to keep it with William Cars Lake.
[175:56.12]The airstrike seems pretty good.
[175:57.50]I agree.
[176:03.42]Alright.
[176:04.44]Alright.
[176:04.98]For everything, really.
[176:06.22]For everything here.
[176:07.82]Oh, these positions matter so much.
[176:15.10]Somebody said Fox only.
[176:16.28]I'm going to lose, lose, lose.
[176:26.43]I know you guys want me to lose because that's like two weeks of things that I have to do.
[176:33.09]I have to win this.
[176:33.99]I have to put out all the stops.
[176:35.31]I've got to win.
[176:39.13]What a difficult board this is.
[176:41.49]This is me taking back shit that I have to do.
[176:45.53]Honestly, even if I win, I still lose.
[176:47.89]I just don't lose as much.
[176:50.27]Yeah, because there's zero risk for me, right?
[176:53.39]Zero risk for you.
[176:58.03]I'm clawing back.
[176:59.39]You're getting more.
[177:02.88]You're going to lose.
[177:03.48]Do I like this board?
[177:05.59]I think I do.
[177:10.41]I think I do.
[177:15.85]I think that's slightly better.
[177:18.05]Are you placing things?
[177:19.75]I've placed everything, yeah.
[177:20.83]Oh, I'm still on the waiting screen.
[177:25.58]Oh, yeah.
[177:25.84]It does say waiting.
[177:27.98]Do we need to re... We may need to redo.
[177:30.84]Okay.
[177:31.22]Alright.
[177:33.85]Oh, yeah.
[177:35.03]My game's, like, frozen.
[177:37.55]Let's reconnect.
[177:38.19]I'll just try to remember this.
[177:41.11]I'll just create a new one.
[177:41.97]I'll send you the code again.
[177:45.49]God is telling you not to do this.
[177:47.95]Well, if God were telling me not to do this, he's got a weird way of saying it because I have to literally dress up in three different costumes.
[177:55.24]And God wants you to dress up as a cat boy.
[177:58.38]God wants this.
[178:01.06]God is here with us on this battleship board.
[178:05.84]I've sent you the code.
[178:07.02]Mm-hmm.
[178:10.25]Colossus Bay.
[178:11.19]I am now in.
[178:13.75]Alright.
[178:13.99]Should be good to go.
[178:18.47]And there we go.
[178:20.71]Alright.
[178:23.81]This is for all the marvels here.
[178:26.99]I'm going to have to do this.
[178:28.47]There's swaths of people invested on my victory.
[178:33.33]I...
[178:34.76]I almost have to turn my monitors off.
[178:37.68]They're gonna like DM me on Discord.
[178:39.27]Monitors off!
[178:42.75]This is like an episode of Schooled.
[178:44.13]Alright.
[178:44.55]How did I place this one before?
[178:57.54]I think it was here.
[179:05.51]You have to think.
[179:59.13]I don't know what to do.
[180:02.59]There's so many ways that this could go so wrong.
[180:28.51]Okay, I'm done.
[180:29.33]I'm done.
[180:29.83]Oh my god.
[180:30.45]Are you prepared?
[180:37.43]Almost.
[180:37.71]There's so much.
[180:46.70]This is a preposterous amount of gambling on Battleship.
[180:52.18]Come on!
[180:55.57]I think it's you.
[180:56.25]That must be you, right?
[180:58.03]Yeah.
[181:00.13]Okay.
[181:00.63]First shot is everything.
[181:03.67]Oh, no!
[181:12.41]It's two.
[181:20.51]I thought it was the three.
[181:21.86]I thought you put the three in a weird place.
[181:24.72]I'm not that cheeky.
[181:25.76]I'm not that cheeky.
[181:33.61]Let's play this strategically.
[181:37.27]Alright.
[181:38.17]Alright.
[181:38.47]Nah.
[181:38.69]Whatever.
[181:38.89]It's all good.
[181:45.90]Going for a mine at the very beginning.
[181:49.08]Nice.
[181:51.63]Uh, this isn't a three.
[181:54.03]It could... I mean, my best bet... No.
[181:57.86]There's only one.
[181:58.38]I should go here.
[182:00.58]Yes.
[182:01.56]Okay.
[182:04.42]That's fucking phenomenal.
[182:05.96]I mean, that's just phenomenal.
[182:06.70]What the fuck?
[182:10.56]Oh my god!
[182:14.01]Oh my God!
[182:14.51]What in God is doing this?
[182:15.78]What the fuck, Loki?
[182:16.88]Put the mask back!
[182:18.18]What the fuck is this bullshit?
[182:20.68]This is ridiculous!
[182:21.92]There's no way!
[182:23.44]No fucking way this is possible!
[182:27.26]If I get the third one, I'm cheating.
[182:29.68]No, fuck that!
[182:32.18]Fuck that!
[182:32.66]Poseidon's throwing a goddamn trident at me!
[182:35.20]This is insanity!
[182:36.66]This is insanity!
[182:37.50]Okay.
[182:38.42]Oh my God.
[182:39.64]Oh my God.
[182:42.14]Oh my God.
[182:42.90]If you hit my, if you hit my thing too.
[182:48.78]I mean, like, just fucking let's go.
[182:51.55]Oh God.
[182:52.07]Give me something for the love of God.
[182:53.59]Drop a bomb fucking everywhere.
[182:56.69]Over here too.
[182:57.29]Let's go.
[182:57.65]Okay.
[182:59.11]Alright.
[182:59.81]Alright.
[183:00.23]Let's save.
[183:00.65]Let's save.
[183:01.09]Okay.
[183:02.37]My God.
[183:02.91]You just had so much money.
[183:04.13]I didn't realize I just gave you the fucking North from.
[183:09.12]gumption supply of- I can't believe you just did like six in a row.
[183:13.47]Ah, God.
[183:15.03]Hey, is he going like this?
[183:15.87]Is he like looking down like an iPhone that has like this frame up?
[183:21.15]I just have it.
[183:22.25]Alright, I gotta think about this.
[183:25.41]These are bigger than two.
[183:27.48]So which means this could be...
[183:33.77]Well, the top one's hard because it could be any of those four.
[183:35.91]Yeah, it could... It's... It's... This one's gonna... Bottom one's easier.
[183:42.88]Bottom one's probably the easiest one because it's literally you can go one way or the other.
[183:46.47]Um... Alright.
[183:50.67]Yeah, that's good.
[183:51.21]Well, now it's hard.
[184:05.58]Oh, phenomenal guess.
[184:06.98]Alright.
[184:09.44]That's good.
[184:09.98]That was good.
[184:10.54]But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[184:12.46]Not quite.
[184:12.86]Because this could be the Tetris piece or the L. Oh, the Tet, yeah.
[184:19.79]That's fair.
[184:37.39]Well, I know what it is now.
[184:38.43]You do know what it is now.
[184:40.29]Okay.
[184:42.00]I can't fucking believe what I'm looking at right here.
[184:43.76]Like, oh yeah, I just got three ships in a row.
[184:50.14]What do I do?
[184:50.70]Alright.
[184:54.58]Well, the problem is you only have the good shit left.
[184:57.79]That's true.
[185:01.95]You son of a bitch.
[185:03.53]That's huge.
[185:05.27]That's actually huge.
[185:08.73]My god you son of a bitch.
[185:10.18]That's actually actually just ignored the oh My god, this is this is bad.
[185:17.28]This is really bad That's huge But can I capitalize on this now what a phenomenal start for that to happen just a missed airstrike At the bottom alright now.
[185:30.44]I'm confused though because is this a
[185:37.20]the l go no yeah could the l go this way can the l go that way I think it can it go like boom boom I think the l could go that way because it goes boom boom but that could also be the three I'm going for it alright I think I got you now I got you wait what
[186:01.95]Oh, no, you do not got me.
[186:02.97]Okay.
[186:03.25]What happened?
[186:04.07]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[186:05.57]Oh, shit.
[186:06.33]It's this way.
[186:07.67]Oh.
[186:07.83]Yeah.
[186:15.88]Okay.
[186:16.22]So it's just either up or down, right?
[186:18.94]Simple enough.
[186:24.88]Are you serious?
[186:27.67]That's terrible.
[186:35.05]Oh, I think I know where that is.
[186:37.07]I think I know what you just did.
[186:38.90]Oh, yeah?
[186:39.58]I think so.
[186:40.84]Take a try.
[186:41.68]Take a gander.
[186:53.33]I don't think you know.
[186:53.89]I have abilities.
[186:59.49]I'm saving the points.
[187:00.49]It's going to come in handy.
[187:05.47]It's alright, he's missing.
[187:06.65]We're good.
[187:12.75]Alright.
[187:16.66]Well, now at least I know what this is.
[187:21.66]Right?
[187:21.98]I'm not freaking myself out for no reason, right?
[187:25.60]No, alright, I got you here.
[187:33.09]Now...
[187:36.38]I think I'm going to sonar this one here.
[187:58.88]Why did I do that?
[188:14.64]Um, alright.
[188:23.95]Two?
[188:25.77]How could it be two?
[188:29.51]I'm so confused.
[188:30.85]What's going on?
[188:32.63]This has to be the three.
[188:35.22]But what the heck?
[188:36.70]Why would it say there are two?
[188:40.60]It's either this way or this way.
[188:45.83]Wait a minute.
[188:49.65]You got a motherfucker right here somewhere.
[188:59.08]Yes!
[189:04.58]Oh god.
[189:06.60]The mines are terrifying.
[189:23.75]What are you doing?
[189:25.43]Fuck!
[189:25.79]I'm freaking out.
[189:26.39]Alright.
[189:27.91]Alright.
[189:28.13]Alright.
[189:28.35]Alright.
[189:28.55]I was placing a mine.
[189:31.89]You are, aren't you?
[189:32.89]Okay.
[189:33.13]Alright.
[189:36.73]Okay.
[189:37.01]Alright.
[189:41.46]Okay.
[189:43.50]That's right.
[189:43.86]That's a given.
[189:44.28]That's pretty big.
[189:47.74]A two and a three.
[189:58.66]Okay.
[190:04.20]What's he up to now?
[190:14.97]Another goddamn mine.
[190:20.80]I should wait, I should wait.
[190:22.00]I'll just wait.
[190:22.52]Patience, patience.
[190:25.84]Well, wait, yeah, it has to be here.
[190:29.19]No, but is that certain?
[190:32.05]It is, that's certain.
[190:33.73]That's certain.
[190:36.63]It's like Minesweeper.
[190:37.83]It has to be here.
[190:39.31]It is certain.
[190:41.26]It's either here or here.
[190:42.18]It's not certain, I'll tell you that much.
[191:13.39]So wait does the sonar mean two ships or does it mean two spaces where there are things?
[191:19.23]I will I will grant you this it means there are two things in that area Which includes mines?
[191:33.15]A bunch of people in chat were saying it means there's two ships you fucked with me
[191:46.97]Down or up?
[191:48.35]Oh, this could be anywhere.
[192:02.41]Fuck.
[192:02.89]Yes.
[192:03.11]Fuck.
[192:04.48]Come on.
[192:04.82]Give me something good.
[192:05.44]Something good.
[192:07.34]Yes.
[192:08.28]Dude, mines are the worst.
[192:21.79]Alright, so it has to be right here.
[192:26.92]Right, of course.
[192:28.14]Okay.
[192:28.98]Now I just got two of your little shit ships.
[192:33.48]And it's either on one side or the other.
[192:36.98]So here's what I'm going to do.
[192:38.83]I'm going to go like this.

[193:43.64]Oh, yes.
[193:45.96]Oh, no.
[193:48.20]Oh, this is bad.
[193:50.93]Oh, this is actually kind of bad.
[193:56.14]I can't be so haphazard.
[193:58.64]It ain't over here.
[194:04.24]I think... I think I got him right here.
[194:10.09]I think I got him right here.
[194:14.79]I think I got him right here.
[194:17.31]It's either right here or it's right here.
[194:22.14]Can I, can I do it?
[194:23.87]Did he do that?
[194:24.77]Did he do it right in the middle?
[194:26.35]Fuck.
[194:47.41]You got it.
[194:47.85]You got it.
[194:48.31]But, but, but.
[194:49.27]This could hit me.
[194:49.81]This could hit me.
[194:55.42]Oh, come on!
[194:56.58]No!
[194:57.10]So it's here, here.
[195:12.34]That's it, right?
[195:33.76]Oh, my God.
[195:35.54]Alright.
[195:36.10]Alright.
[195:36.58]So we're going to do one more.
[195:38.94]We're going to do one more.
[195:47.40]At this point.
[195:48.64]Alright.
[195:48.94]The last one is more.
[195:50.77]Hold on.
[195:52.49]What would you offer a man who has it all?
[196:01.83]Alright.
[196:03.82]Oh shit!
[196:12.48]What do I even owe you?
[196:13.39]I owe you like... You won the showcase on... The price is right!
[196:18.59]There's nothing more I can even offer you!
[196:20.15]I won the free trip to Hawaii from United Airlines.
[196:24.80]I won the house in Malibu.
[196:27.84]I won the entire Lexus car.
[196:31.57]You got both showcases.
[196:32.77]They don't even do that on the show.
[196:34.91]I think I got... I feel like James Holzhauer right now.
[196:40.76]The most winning game show contestant of all time.
[196:48.80]Fuck.
[196:52.51]Well, that was a blast.
[196:57.19]I'm glad I owe three weeks of content.
[197:03.04]It's so much.
[197:04.36]It's almost too much.
[197:06.04]I will say, does this make it easier?
[197:10.12]We can space it out, you know?
[197:12.86]A payment plan, so to speak.
[197:15.42]A monthly payment plan?
[197:17.39]Yeah, you know, we can't just do three tweets in a week or something.
[197:21.45]That's absurd.
[197:22.81]I'm going to buy almonds.
[197:26.25]Well, that's the least of your concerns.
[197:28.55]Almonds are easy to come by.
[197:29.69]Yeah.
[197:32.29]Alright, can I consolidate this?
[197:34.89]Can I consolidate this?
[197:37.27]Yeah.
[197:38.21]Okay.
[197:39.11]Here's my offer.
[197:40.39]Please.
[197:40.89]One tweet in a catboy outfit with almonds in front of me, looking into the mirror of an oven, with the stomach sticking out, stomach big, big, oh, I eat too many almonds, whatever.
[197:52.65]And, like, I have, like, a mega milk photo behind me.
[197:58.25]I will...
[198:00.08]I will allow you to consolidate two of the tweets into one.
[198:04.44]Three is a bit... It's a bit... Look, the almond tweet's your tweet, right?
[198:13.39]Technically.
[198:14.13]Technically, yeah.
[198:16.69]So I feel fine.
[198:18.39]What if we just consolidate cat and milk into one?
[198:30.03]I did not think I was going to be having this conversation.
[198:33.97]Oh, let's combine cat and milk into one.
[198:36.42]I'm just sitting here like, we were going to play Battleship.
[198:39.28]A mega milkmaid, if you will.
[198:47.24]Like you at some, like a doorstep, like an old, with an old timey, uh, bag of milk, you know, like, like a tray, like a, you got all of your six.
[198:56.61]Okay.
[198:56.87]Could I just have a huge thing of milk?
[198:59.25]That's a, that's Omega milk.
[199:00.69]You know what I mean?
[199:01.23]That's a lot of milk.
[199:02.66]How much milk?
[199:04.44]A huge amount.
[199:05.68]It would need to be minimum, like five gallons.
[199:08.16]I don't know if I even get that much.
[199:10.23]Well, that's what I'm saying.
[199:10.99]Like, how big is this?
[199:11.81]Because a gallon of milk is like, that's normal.
[199:14.90]Two gallons is even somewhat feasible, but standard.
[199:25.19]How about we consolidate it?
[199:27.25]Easily, right?
[199:28.33]So it's you, right?
[199:29.67]Hey, it's me, Jerma!
[199:32.19]And you're wearing a cat boy costume.
[199:36.23]But it's a cat maid outfit, right?
[199:38.48]Okay.
[199:39.90]And you have like the milk delivery cartons.
[199:42.68]And it's just like a perspective of someone opening their door to greet you.
[199:47.50]And then the caption is mega milk maid.
[199:50.83]And, you know, I feel like that's a good consolidation there.
[199:55.33]Oh, that's somehow worse.
[199:57.89]Somehow it's way worse.
[200:01.53]For that, I would almost be willing to just, you know, throw out the almond tweet.
[200:08.94]You know, for Mega Milkmaid, that's just one big juicy tweet.
[200:18.18]But it needs to be almond milk?
[200:21.85]yeah yeah it's mega milkmaid you're not wearing a cat made outfit and and you have almond milk that you're delivering with the caption mega milkmaid can we play one more for what for me to look at me look at me do you see me three hours and 20 minutes has changed you you do look
[200:49.27]concerned in a way like I would be concerned if I walked by you alright alright here's alright here's we're gonna do we're gonna do we're gonna do one more one more how do I even alright we're gonna okay so this is how it's um uh-huh so I will accept your omega milkmaid okay okay I accept that offer right
[201:17.87]so this next one is to I don't even know how I even alright this is to do a okay
[201:28.12]This next game, because we already know the tweet's happening, right?
[201:30.64]Like, I'm not going to be like, well, we'll check that out.
[201:32.77]Okay.
[201:33.15]Sure.
[201:33.67]This next game, and this is the final game.
[201:35.75]This is it.
[201:36.31]This is it.
[201:36.65]This is it.
[201:37.31]This is it.
[201:38.73]By the way, it's been a blast.
[201:39.51]It's been a pleasure.
[201:40.55]I've had a great time today.
[201:41.81]It's been absolutely fantastically fun.
[201:45.09]This is to solely, if I win, is to remove the cat costume.
[201:55.03]So you would be delivering milk as a Mega Milk maid, but without the cat costume in this picture now?
[202:01.65]Are you wearing the Mega Milk shirt?
[202:04.17]Let's really nail down the T's and the I's here.
[202:12.76]I think I'd probably rather just be the cat.
[202:16.32]Let's pick a poison here, because look, you're down bad, but hey, I want to help you refinance, restructure.
[202:25.88]so I understand that laugh was just like that was such like a perfect evil laugh I would love to help you restructure this now let's let's just talk brass tacks are are we more scared of the cat or the milk because we're gonna have to pick a poison here we're gonna have to go down a road Robert frost style we gotta pick one now you know cat
[202:51.94]Is the lesser of two evils or the eviler?
[202:54.54]I think it's the eviler.
[202:59.16]Do you see my vision of this image of this tweet?
[203:01.53]It's you delivering milk as a mega milk maid with a cat costume.
[203:06.81]It's got to be up there.
[203:08.51]I mean, this thing's going to be downloaded.
[203:10.59]Let me just say that.
[203:11.27]This is going to be downloaded.
[203:13.26]I mean, the amount of fan art that will come from this will teach artists for years.
[203:18.27]it's just like this is going to be the modern day scream it's going to be recreated so many times I am down to just let's just remove the cat in this next wager let's just get rid of the cat and you are now just you just wear a shirt that happens to say mega milk which which could mean anything alright delivering almond milk alright what if I lose
[203:41.57]There's nothing else that you can add?
[203:43.07]You're just giving me, like, outs.
[203:45.49]Which I very much appreciate, by the way.
[203:48.93]That's what happens if you win.
[203:49.97]If you lose, unfortunately, the cat stays.
[203:53.71]How about this?
[203:54.92]If I lose, there's no more, like, oh, double down.
[203:57.24]No, no.
[203:57.88]If I lose, it's over.
[203:58.74]That's it.
[203:59.73]It's locked in.
[204:00.71]How about, yeah, I am down.
[204:02.16]That's what I win.
[204:03.38]If I win this, is that it just, it's almost like I'm able to walk away from the table.
[204:10.16]And it has to be done.
[204:11.34]It's like we'll just nod at each other in passing, knowing that the deal's been done and it's been written in ink.
[204:18.96]Okay.
[204:20.12]It's over.
[204:21.78]Yeah, so you pressed the accept button.
[204:25.25]What?
[204:28.04]Wait, what?
[204:28.66]What was the next part?
[204:29.52]I said, if I win, the deal's over.
[204:32.98]Call it done.
[204:33.68]That's it.
[204:34.24]We're going to be, you know, nodding as we pass and fake breasts.
[204:39.46]No.
[204:40.64]No, I'll walk away from the table right now.
[204:43.98]I'm kidding.
[204:44.82]I'm kidding.
[204:45.26]I'm kidding.
[204:45.74]Come on.
[204:46.62]We can joke around, you know.
[204:51.34]This, this, these keep getting, we're getting more and more and more things added.
[204:55.86]Eventually, what are you going to, I'm going to have to put like something on my head, like a crown or something.
[204:59.12]What's next?
[205:00.24]SpaceX ship about to launch.
[205:03.18]Alright.
[205:03.64]With Jeff Bezos bald head.
[205:06.40]No, no, I actually am happy to wager cat for, for deal being done.
[205:18.65]um and that and then just and that's good for me and that's it and that's it and then that's it's over yeah this is just this is more of a uh you're really giving me an out yeah it's kind of giving you it out it's also like ball don't lie you know what I mean and you know I'm shooting the extra shot we're contesting it ball don't lie if I win this one then I mean it's true it's there's nothing else you're just giving me an extra life here to basically peel back one of the layers of onions
[205:45.16]Yeah.
[205:46.62]But also, if I win, it's so reaffirmed that you couldn't argue it, which is a victory in some sense.
[205:50.77]There's no arguing this.
[205:51.61]This is it.
[205:53.83]Alright, let's do it.
[205:57.13]There's almost a meta that's formed right now.
[206:08.00]No.
[206:09.12]Yeah, I don't know what to do here.
[206:13.29]I have no idea how to place my ships.
[206:47.56]Everything looks so wrong to me.
[206:49.05]You know what I mean?
[207:03.47]Everything just looks so wrong.
[207:17.84]This is crazy.
[207:43.18]This is crazy, but... Ugh.
[207:51.12]I think I'm happy with this.
[207:55.10]Now I am.
[207:55.70]Nope.
[207:56.62]Now I am.
[207:57.78]Nope.
[207:58.20]Now I am.
[208:02.22]I'm happy with this.
[208:32.19]Go.
[208:34.33]I am panicking over here.
[208:35.99]Not ready.
[209:06.63]So hard to avoid.
[209:29.52]Fuck it, whatever.
[209:38.04]Alright, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.
[209:39.28]Let's go.
[209:40.82]Oh, God.
[209:41.54]Alright, come on, baby.
[209:42.22]Come on, give me tails, give me tails.
[209:46.12]That's both of us, isn't it?
[209:47.88]Yeah, yeah, but I'm silver, you're bronze.
[209:49.82]Alright, what I found to be one of the best strategies is this.
[210:01.62]Not as good of a start, for sure.
[210:02.94]I did have a godlike start, and it was a close game, too.
[210:06.92]Oof, oof.
[210:12.00]Bit of a mind war we have here.
[210:13.43]This is more mind sweeper than battleship.
[210:14.91]It is.
[210:17.23]He's more man than machine.
[210:18.43]Damn it.
[210:28.24]Come on, come on.
[210:31.72]Let's do that.
[210:37.00]Just a couple of mines.
[210:38.34]Alright.
[210:38.92]So you go in mine strategy here.
[210:41.64]Well, it gives you two hits.
[210:43.90]So anytime you do an airfield sweep, it's just like game over.
[210:47.89]Come on, baby.
[210:57.13]Come on.
[211:01.40]More mines.
[211:02.12]You're really going with the mines here.
[211:08.37]It also fucks up your sonar.
[211:10.05]I mean... Yeah, it does.
[211:11.71]It truly does.
[211:15.87]There's so much meta.
[211:35.98]What are you thinking of doing?
[211:40.18]Where did you put that, you son of a bitch?
[211:47.82]This is the most tense.
[211:49.70]So, buddy, you're looking over with a stack of $100 bills.
[211:52.64]I've got, like, 50 cents on the table.
[211:55.24]And I just want you wiped out.
[211:56.70]And you're just like, oh, boy, that was tricky.
[211:59.27]Wow, tricky for that one.
[212:00.61]And I'm just like, yeah, it was really tricky.
[212:02.21]I got 50 cents.
[212:15.65]Well.
[212:17.33]Well, well, well.
[212:19.11]What do we have here?
[212:21.47]Not there.
[212:25.86]I'm just copying him?
[212:28.64]He's won five straight games in a row.
[212:31.50]Why would I not want to do what he's doing?
[212:33.34]Okay.
[212:38.56]Alright.
[212:39.04]Where are you going now?
[212:42.14]You put a bomb over here.
[212:43.64]I did.
[212:44.36]You did.
[212:47.01]There it is!
[212:47.35]Oh my fucking god.
[212:53.57]Oh my god, that is so huge.
[212:56.53]That's blessed.
[213:05.85]Thinking about putting a mine over there?
[213:10.12]I knew it!
[213:11.56]Devious, devious.
[213:13.28]Okay, alright.
[213:14.60]Let's do this.
[213:15.20]Let's sweep this here.
[213:21.85]What did you do up here?
[213:23.59]Nothing.
[213:28.27]So that's either your L, or more realistically, some tugboat that's just been... Did I just find your L?
[213:42.50]Oh, I just found it.
[213:46.46]Homer!
[213:46.72]Homie!
[213:49.81]Oh, my God.
[213:51.37]I just found your L perfectly.
[213:55.03]I thought that was a minefield for sure.
[213:56.47]Okay.
[213:57.05]You're rich now, though.
[213:57.81]That's concerning.
[214:03.67]My best bet's right.
[214:11.68]I still don't even have anything of yours even uncovered.
[214:15.26]Well, you have a sweep over there.
[214:18.78]Yeah, but...
[214:30.64]Do I just airstrike right down the middle?
[214:35.89]Or just airstrike over here because I'll know those eventually.
[214:44.01]I think that's the play.
[214:46.49]That's the play.
[214:52.65]Oh, that is so bad.
[214:53.03]Oh, that was one of your twos.
[214:54.43]That was one of my twos.
[215:00.20]Why does that why is that even a thing that can happen?
[215:03.60]What is this?
[215:04.58]What happened my my random missile?
[215:08.68]Oh or my spot which triggered you hitting me which could just be a forever chain.
[215:13.98]Oh, that's funny alright, well I You have the two you didn't put two twos up here.
[215:21.99]Did you oh?
[215:29.17]Damn it.
[215:30.25]I was really hoping you'd go for row three.
[215:35.07]I think you did.
[215:37.96]You didn't.
[215:40.20]I thought you did, like, a one-two, just trying to be a weirdo.
[215:42.50]Like, you would have freaked me out or something.
[215:46.12]No, no, none of that.
[215:47.22]None of that shenanigans.
[215:48.12]Alright, you must be here.
[215:49.57]Just have to be.
[215:52.83]Are you serious?
[215:53.87]No, man.
[215:54.03]Alright, let's do this.
[216:00.43]Ooh, okay.
[216:04.13]Alright.
[216:04.55]Alright.
[216:06.19]I'm narrowing it down bit by bit, inch by inch.
[216:11.12]Oh, you... He could be... He's probably here.
[216:18.18]Alright.
[216:18.82]There you are.
[216:20.34]He did find me.
[216:25.46]Here's the real question, though.
[216:26.55]Is this your L...
[216:30.77]Or is this your three?
[216:40.95]Your three.
[216:43.18]Oh, this is a tight war right now.
[216:45.24]Now?
[217:00.10]There you are.
[217:00.56]There you are.
[217:02.98]Say it like such a villain.
[217:08.24]Okay.
[217:11.94]They are.
[217:15.62]This could be your Tetris shape in the top left or bottom.
[217:19.20]No, it can't be bottom right.
[217:21.44]Thank you.
[217:21.84]Fuck.
[217:23.06]Fuck.
[217:23.98]Thank you.
[217:25.06]I've wasted eight turns on this one.
[217:30.73]Damn it.
[217:31.97]Let's do one of these though.
[217:51.25]I'm on a sonar meta right now.
[217:52.83]You are on the sonar meta?
[217:54.33]Yeah.
[217:54.51]Three.
[217:56.37]Three?
[218:05.44]Nice.
[218:06.02]Nice.
[218:06.34]Come on.
[218:09.30]Give me something.
[218:11.54]It's fine.
[218:20.27]It's fine.
[218:21.35]Devious.
[218:22.83]I know where you are now.
[218:24.33]This is guaranteed.
[218:25.19]All but.
[218:27.15]Okay.
[218:27.77]Lovely.
[218:28.07]That's a good one to take down.
[218:30.39]Now, we have four over here, so you placed a bomb up here.
[218:34.63]You did place a bomb up here, but if we have three before that, then it couldn't be here.
[218:40.64]It would most likely have to have been the four piece.
[218:45.60]So this is guaranteed either way.
[218:50.00]Fuck!
[218:51.89]No!
[219:04.05]Alright.
[219:04.89]Oh, fuck.
[219:06.65]That happened.
[219:07.57]Let's do one of these.
[219:09.63]Alright.
[219:13.43]Well, it's one of these two spaces because you just put a bomb over here.
[219:18.52]What could this even be?
[219:19.28]Actually, that was stupid of me.
[219:27.74]There's literally only one place I could put the bomb.
[219:30.53]But wait, hold on.
[219:31.89]Could this just be it here?
[219:33.49]I wonder.
[219:49.95]Okay.
[219:50.57]I think I got you.
[219:52.53]I think I got you here.
[219:53.21]Hold on.
[219:57.55]No, this could be anything.
[219:58.55]This could be anything.
[219:59.31]This could be your three.
[220:00.33]This could be your two.
[220:00.99]This could be anything.
[220:03.95]Okay.
[220:04.71]Is it the two?
[220:05.47]No.
[220:07.45]Now, here's the tricky part, though.
[220:09.83]This could be your Tetris piece.
[220:14.87]Or could it not?
[220:15.69]I think this is your three.
[220:18.92]But did you go this way or this way?
[220:28.22]The amount of stress I have right now is so unparalleled.
[220:32.26]You went this way.
[220:34.10]Okay.
[220:35.50]Wait.
[220:36.52]No, hold on.
[220:37.54]I think this is your Tetris piece.
[220:38.98]It's right here, isn't it?
[220:40.85]Isn't it?
[220:42.07]You can tell me.
[220:43.17]My hair is crazy.
[221:05.92]It is.
[221:06.26]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[221:07.44]I got you.
[221:07.94]I got you.
[221:08.35]I got you.
[221:08.73]I got you.
[221:12.37]You did get me.
[221:13.49]I'm now quite stressed.
[221:17.61]You are in a good position, though.
[221:19.27]You've got your two is magically somewhere over here.
[221:23.08]So, let's see if I can do this.
[221:31.50]Okay.
[221:32.68]Shit, really?
[221:33.04]Really?
[221:37.02]Only one?
[221:45.73]Put your two right here.
[221:46.51]Okay.
[221:58.17]That was the bomb.
[221:58.91]There was three before.
[222:01.57]There's a four piece remaining.
[222:03.09]How are there three?
[222:03.81]Terrible.
[222:04.31]Why are people calling me terrible?
[222:05.44]What?
[222:06.06]How are there three in here?
[222:08.12]Did I, I must've found two boats.
[222:09.66]I must've pinged two boats.
[222:18.59]Cause that that's a two, which must, unless you put a bomb.
[223:06.02]Irma's not of sound mind and Ludwig is taking advantage of him.
[223:10.34]What do you mean?
[223:10.94]I thought that was stupid.
[223:14.18]Fuck, that was stupid.
[223:18.30]You just, that was a lot of points.
[223:20.90]Yeah, I think it's too late for the airstrike.
[223:28.16]Where is this?
[223:29.18]This, okay.
[223:33.38]This shit has to be like over here.
[223:40.50]This one did that, this one did that.
[223:44.54]I wonder if, I wonder, I wonder if it's down here.
[223:47.00]Sonaring this is not, maybe I'll sonar this one?
[223:53.02]No.
[223:59.72]Your two could just be anywhere, that's the problem.
[224:03.26]It could be anywhere, yeah.
[224:05.42]But the problem is, if I- I'm gonna- this- I already hit these two, so I would realistically only be hitting, like, these three.
[224:16.33]I'm gonna sonar this one.
[224:17.96]No, that's- no, sonar this one?
[224:22.74]Sonar this one?
[224:23.58]No.
[224:26.30]I think I'm gonna sonar this one.
[224:27.54]I'm going for it.
[224:28.07]Fuck it.
[224:32.78]Oh, bingo.
[224:33.68]Okay.
[224:35.00]So, interestingly enough, it ain't any of these ones.
[224:37.94]I think you're down here.
[224:41.66]Okay.
[224:49.31]Alright.
[224:50.11]Now, is this the two or is this the Tetris piece?
[225:13.50]Wait, what did I do?
[225:13.94]I fucked up?
[225:14.62]How did I fuck up?
[225:15.84]I thought there was a... He still has a 2.
[225:21.52]He still had a 2.
[225:59.28]Okay.
[226:01.72]If I think this through, I might have it won right here.
[226:11.94]Is it right here?
[226:15.52]Right?
[226:15.92]Because it has to be.
[226:17.50]Oh, this is a bomb.
[226:18.80]This is either a bomb or it's right fucking here.
[226:21.52]It's so fucking tense.
[226:27.38]Well, Habit 1's bold.
[226:28.38]You're still missing... Oh, I won't say that.
[226:30.56]This is the sonar picks up bombs, right?
[226:33.28]Yeah.
[226:38.61]This is a bomb.
[226:39.87]This is a bomb.
[226:40.89]This is a bomb.
[226:41.75]This is a bomb.
[226:42.69]This is a bomb.
[226:43.73]This is a bomb.
[226:44.65]This is a bomb.
[226:45.51]This is a bomb.
[226:47.33]I fucking knew it was a bomb and I still clicked it!
[226:53.21]Oh, no!
[226:53.73]Oh, come on, please.
[227:00.15]That's fucking huge.
[227:03.51]How unlucky can you get?
[227:07.49]Oh, that is so bad for me.
[227:14.79]Oh, this is all down to this turn, I think.
[227:16.59]This is all just fucked.
[227:32.19]Here we go.
[227:34.95]Okay.
[227:35.27]Alright.
[227:35.77]I need to win.
[227:36.23]I need to win right now.
[227:38.05]Now, this has to be down.
[227:39.83]It has to be.
[227:40.43]Oh.
[227:40.51]Oh.
[228:31.08]I think there's only two possible locations.
[228:37.11]No.
[228:39.73]I think there's only one.
[228:42.89]I think it has to be here.
[228:45.91]Fuck!
[229:00.04]Germo.
[229:04.43]I will give you one last attempt.
[229:09.36]What?
[229:09.62]You mean play another game?
[229:12.08]No.
[229:13.50]That's not what I mean.
[229:16.52]Wait, you're throwing on purpose?
[229:18.30]I'm giving you one turn.
[229:20.66]One turn?
[229:22.34]One turn to save everything you cherish.
[229:27.80]Good luck.
[229:28.42]What a good guy.
[229:31.24]It's not going to be easy.
[229:36.90]You're going to have to guess right on which ship is where and what coordination is it.
[229:52.81]Right here.
[229:53.53]I'm going to the bottom right.
[230:05.37]Because if it's, if it's, this is the, I'll get good info, right?
[230:09.09]This is info.
[230:10.55]There's no info.
[230:11.13]It's your last turn.
[230:12.07]I know, but this is info.
[230:14.01]There's no, oh, unless you're doing like a major shot.
[230:16.26]Yeah, that's fine.
[230:17.52]This is info.
[230:26.16]Oh no, but you hit my thing.
[230:27.44]What?
[230:38.00]I got you.
[230:38.64]I got you.
[230:39.00]This is it.
[230:39.60]I did it.
[230:40.62]Did you get me?
[230:42.00]No, because now all that's left is this is your Tetris piece.
[230:45.20]But which way is it going?
[230:46.98]Yeah, how do you know where it's going?
[230:48.12]I don't know.
[230:48.48]I have to sonar something.
[230:51.68]I have to sonar this one here.
[230:53.47]No, wait.
[230:54.33]Take your time.
[230:54.89]I don't want to dress up as a cat.
[230:58.13]Sonar this one or sonar this one.
[231:03.41]I got to sonar the top right one.
[231:08.78]Because this would be 1, 2, this would be 3.
[231:11.30]Right?
[231:13.75]Or this one.
[231:14.65]This one, right?
[231:16.49]But this one, because if it was going down, then it'd be 1, 2, it would be 1.
[231:21.73]If it was going this way, if it was 1, 2, bang, bang, that means this would just be 1.
[231:27.77]Right?
[231:33.02]That's, that's, this, alright, here we go, I'm going for it.
[231:36.12]But could you flip it some weird way?
[231:39.94]Oh yeah, you can flip horizontally.
[231:46.62]Four?
[231:49.83]What do you mean four?
[231:55.49]You have a bomb in every spot here.
[232:03.11]it's one it's okay it's either one two three four one two three four oh my god but but it has to be this one here has to has to be guaranteed one below has to be this has to be it at least this one it has to be at least it can't be a bomb here there's no way this would connect to anything
[232:33.92]But shit, but what if it's these two?
[232:36.16]Because it could be this one and this one, couldn't it?
[232:45.09]Oh, no.
[232:49.91]What would you have done?
[232:52.91]I want you to trust yourself.
[232:54.55]Maybe flip a coin.
[232:56.45]But you might have bombs here.
[232:59.28]It could be one.
[233:00.16]It could be bang, bang, or it could be just bang, bang.
[233:05.85]Or... Or it could be... Close your eyes.
[233:09.15]Take a breath.
[233:10.33]Take the shot.
[233:13.39]Well, I have a sonar here.
[233:16.92]0, 0, 0, 0, 0.
[233:17.56]I got you.
[233:18.42]I got you.
[233:18.84]I did it.
[233:19.98]Fuck!
[233:20.92]It's your... The Zero IQ Jerma figured it out.
[233:23.48]By God.
[233:25.22]Right?
[233:26.00]I'm so... I don't know.
[233:26.96]1, 2... Hold on.
[233:29.26]0.
[233:29.28]0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.
[233:29.80]So it has to be this one.
[233:49.45]Thank you, Dad, for letting me play the game.
[233:51.44]Hey!
[233:53.30]Look, I can't take $1,500, a cat boy, three tweets, four exclamation points, seven houses on our first time hanging out.
[234:00.81]That's too much, alright?
[234:02.21]We got to draw the line somewhere.
[234:04.57]So what do I actually have to do now?
[234:07.27]You owe one tweet?
[234:09.32]Uh-huh.
[234:10.27]where you are delivering almond milk in a Mega Milk costume.
[234:14.55]Oh, fuck.
[234:15.03]That sucks.
[234:16.43]And you also have to wear that on stream.
[234:18.75]Oh, that sucks, too.
[234:20.65]And then you have to put, I think, $1,500 on black at a roulette table.
[234:28.65]Oh, my God.
[234:29.07]That sucks.
[234:30.61]Yeah.
[234:31.51]What happened today?
[234:33.29]What happened here?
[234:36.61]uh so I don't I don't feel too the alternative would have just the only thing you've won there is the removal of cat which which I feel I feel okay with that excuse me and like 70 bucks 80 bucks whatever it was that's true you did also win 80 bucks that you didn't wait how many subs of it well no the subs are removed the subs were replaced with that with that uh with uh with the with the wager for the roulette so zero subs
[235:01.63]Wait, I thought I got... No, no, it wasn't subs.
[235:03.27]It was dollars, right?
[235:04.29]$50?
[235:04.95]Because it was 96 subs, and then it's been translated to the casino bet.
[235:11.23]Oh, okay.
[235:12.05]So just give me a list of things I have to do.
[235:14.13]I'll do them.
[235:14.69]I'll just... I'll send you the list of errands.
[235:19.51]Ludwig, what a hero.
[235:20.93]What a streamer hero for me.
[235:23.83]Yeah, let me tell you, I've made enemies in both of our chats from that.
[235:28.46]Hey, but here's the thing, though.
[235:30.78]I could have really, I could have fucked that up big time.
[235:33.22]No, you could have easily fucked that up.
[235:34.48]Easily.
[235:35.84]I think that explosion you placed in the bottom right, that was a good explosion.
[235:39.86]Yep.
[235:40.28]Because you could have decided to have placed that in the top and that would have been much tougher.
[235:46.18]Well, that was fucking a lot of fun.
[235:48.28]Yeah, I had a blast.
[235:49.10]I had a blast.
[235:49.64]Thanks for playing games.
[235:50.73]I did not think we were going to do this for four hours, but we did.
[235:52.89]No, yeah, we were like, we should get a list of games because we're probably going to get a little bored.
[235:57.93]That was awesome.
[235:59.29]No, absolutely not.
[236:00.15]That was a pleasure.
[236:01.65]And I'm glad you had fun.
[236:03.91]Because even though I feel like we're leaving on a note as if you had won, you lost so much.
[236:10.91]I very much lost a shitload.
[236:14.36]yeah but I won the first like three games got really overconfident and then lost five or six in a row it did feel for some reason like it was easier for me I don't know I think you just psych yourself out because even at the end like it was mathematically proven with the sonar yeah but you I think just the stress your brain just melted yeah uh yeah it does that uh but that was great that was a pleasure and I'll see you again Tuesday that's right I didn't even tell anybody
[236:44.22]Nobody even knows what's happening on Tuesday.
[236:45.80]This is the first time I've streamed since last week.
[236:48.08]Oh, really?
[236:48.42]Yeah, they don't know.
[236:49.16]I've told my chat.
[236:50.22]I don't think you've told your chat.
[236:51.32]Would you like to go ahead and tell them what's going to happen on Tuesday?
[236:53.51]Oh, yeah.
[236:54.59]You want my words?
[236:55.35]I can do my words.
[236:55.83]Yeah, but it's your event.
[236:56.75]Yeah, this Tuesday, I put $5,000 on the line for a 12-streamer Mario Kart tournament.
[237:06.87]It's going to be about two hours starting at 6 p.m.
[237:09.26]Pacific, and it features myself, Jerma, Cutie, Connor, Simply, Mizkiff, Clint, Mango, XQC, Northern Lion, Moist Critical, and a mystery guest, meaning I haven't filled a slot yet.
[237:25.59]But that's it.
[237:26.01]That's this Tuesday.
[237:27.09]Is it the Switch Mario Kart?
[237:29.45]It is the Switch Mario Kart.
[237:30.67]So you'll need that game to capture it, which I think you got that already, right?
[237:34.75]Yeah, yeah, I got it.
[237:36.91]But yeah, that's Tuesday at 6.
[237:38.77]It should be about a two-hour session, and then there will be winners.
[237:44.64]Yeah, I'm ready to go.
[237:46.12]I'm actually not bad at that game.
[237:49.09]I am pretty bad, so I don't expect myself to place well, but I think the favorites going in are definitely Clint and Northern Lion, because all that man does is just win shit.
[237:58.97]He just wins.
[237:59.73]He just wins things.
[238:01.29]That's what he does.
[238:02.43]He's a winner.
[238:03.17]He's a winner in a bald man's body.
[238:07.21]What?
[238:07.37]What are you talking about?
[238:09.59]Like, you know, he's a winner, but he took one out.
[238:15.63]I mean, your hair is looking great.
[238:16.69]Like, you're not on your...
[238:19.27]I don't know, man.
[238:21.17]It's happening.
[238:22.03]I'll be bald at 40.
[238:23.75]Do you think if you feel like it's coming, you would take Propecia?
[238:27.21]No.
[238:29.31]No, just drink some extra green tea and have some fish oil and shit.
[238:32.83]You'll be fine.
[238:33.84]Yeah.
[238:35.16]Me, I would have an existential crisis when it's coming.
[238:37.68]Both my grandparents are bald.
[238:38.64]It is coming.
[238:39.72]I know.
[238:39.94]Me too.
[238:41.22]It's going to happen in the next probably three or four years.
[238:44.22]I'm going to be 40.
[238:45.00]I'll be 40 in less than five years, guys.
[238:46.92]What are you talking about?
[238:48.11]Five years is a long time, alright?
[238:50.85]And look, this is 40, 40-year-old virgin.
[238:54.53]That's a hot year.
[238:55.51]People like that year.
[238:56.33]Excuse me.
[239:00.35]Excuse me.
[239:01.45]40-year-old.
[239:02.21]Excuse me.
[239:04.73]Yes, 40.
[239:04.99]You just called me a virgin?
[239:10.57]No, I'm saying that, like, it's a popular, like, you know how, like, when you turn 22, you're like, oh, Taylor Swift, I'm feeling 22.
[239:17.61]40, it has so many exciting things that come along with it, like the movie The 40-Year-Old Virgin is an omen to 40-year-olds or, um, this is 40.
[239:25.92]Who are virgins.
[239:28.41]That's what the movie's about.
[239:30.23]Yeah, but it's a footnote.
[239:31.53]It's a footnote.
[239:32.25]It's more so about... I think virgin comes up 2,000 times in the script.
[239:36.75]It's mostly just a vehicle for talking about the beauty of aging more so than about virginity, which is a beautiful thing in its own right.
[239:47.90]Virginity.
[239:51.30]Alright, man.
[239:52.00]It's been a fucking pleasure.
[239:52.96]This is the first time we ever hung out on stream.
[239:56.26]Yeah, it's a blast.
[239:57.34]And now we've definitely set up one more hangout.
[240:00.49]And at some point, I'm going to knock on your door with a far too expensive bidet for your asshole.
[240:05.65]I can't wait to spray water into my ass.
[240:09.99]It'll be clipped.
[240:12.82]not live though oh god oh god yeah I'll see you I'll see you on Tuesday but alright yeah I'll see you I'll see you have a good rest of your day yeah take care man thanks for playing alright bye bye that was a lot of fun uh yeah when we first turned the stream on we were like oh yeah maybe we'll play like battleship for like I don't know maybe like 40 minutes maybe like 30 minutes maybe a tops that was a lot of fun
[240:39.41]I just have to do a bunch of stuff.
[240:41.69]Why does it always end up like this?
[240:44.07]Anytime there's competition, I always end up dressing up in a costume.
[240:48.60]That happens every time.
[240:53.04]I'll figure out how those tweets are going to happen.
[240:57.12]He's got to get the shirt, if that's the shirt he wants.
[240:59.09]We've got some stuff to do.
[241:01.54]But that's a perfect opportunity for me to stop.
[241:04.72]That was Ludwig, if you don't know.
[241:06.59]I mean, how could you not know Ludwig at this point?
[241:09.89]He's a hilarious fucking top ten streamer.
[241:14.01]He's probably in my top five, at least, of all streamers.
[241:17.99]Go follow him.
[241:18.37]If you don't, which I don't know how you don't.
[241:23.97]But, yeah, well, um, I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[241:26.21]I'll be streaming on Tuesday.
[241:27.49]I'll probably be streaming my perspective from the Mario Kart tournament.
[241:31.55]I have some practicing to do, so I'm going to be streaming, um, because I haven't, I've never streamed Mario Kart.
[241:38.06]So we'll see how that goes.
[241:39.40]I need practice.
[241:41.80]But, um, is Ludwig still going to stream or is he ending?
[241:55.06]I think we're ending, right?
[242:02.73]That was a lot of fun.
[242:03.23]Yeah, it was.
[242:03.59]Thank you for the subs, by the way.
[242:08.59]I didn't really pay.
[242:09.13]I was kind of locked in.
[242:10.55]My brain was kind of locked in to, you know, everything that's going on on the screen.
[242:20.98]Yeah, I will see you guys later on Tuesday.
[242:24.76]6 p.m.
[242:25.84]Pacific, by the way.
[242:27.08]6 p.m.
[242:33.03]That's going to be a late start.
[242:35.41]9 p.m.

[242:43.70]He's playing Noita.
[242:47.23]So... We all know how... That's a notorious stream here.
[242:51.39]So go say hello to Joel Barg Skeletor if you don't know.
[242:58.28]He's a very, very, very, very, very good streamer.
[243:00.82]Very funny guy.
[243:04.98]And I will see you guys Tuesday.
[243:09.50]Good night.
[243:09.84]Goodbye.
[243:10.12]Have a great rest of your afternoons.
[243:13.26]Battleship game tag on Twitch.
[243:14.82]Yeah, what the fuck is going on there?
[243:18.06]I feel like we gave that just enough attention to be confused.
[243:27.63]Let's get the raid going.
[243:32.81]Goodbye.
[243:33.29]Good night.
[243:34.01]Take care.
[243:34.35]Bye, stinking man.
