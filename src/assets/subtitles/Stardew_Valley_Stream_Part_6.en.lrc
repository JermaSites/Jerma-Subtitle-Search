[00:02.14]do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
[00:54.01]Good evening.
[00:57.60]Good evening.
[01:02.58]Do I have any idea what time it is?
[01:03.74]Yeah, this is why it's a late night wintry mix stream.
[01:13.89]It's going good.
[01:14.85]How you guys all doing?
[01:21.98]So this is a storage facility.
[01:26.42]It seems kind of odd.
[01:27.70]The fridge, I can put just random shit in here.
[01:31.17]How's my back?
[01:32.61]It hurts.
[01:34.61]I don't know why.
[01:35.19]I can't figure it out.
[01:39.37]I'm probably going to have to go to the doctor.
[01:43.41]Because I've never experienced this before.
[01:45.30]I've had back pain before, but it is odd, I will say.
[01:54.83]Alright, it's winter time.
[01:55.55]I got a lot of money.
[01:57.43]I just upgraded the house for the first time.
[02:03.63]So let's just, uh... Gather more materials.
[02:09.23]I got some sprinklers now.
[02:14.13]These are not quality sprinklers.
[02:15.23]Didn't I already make a couple quality sprinklers?
[02:18.31]Or not yet.
[02:22.10]Need more gold.
[02:23.32]Yeah, I'm gonna do some mining.
[02:27.23]I thought you said you didn't stream on weekends.
[02:30.13]It depends.
[02:31.60]If I'm feeling it, I'll do it.
[02:35.04]Realistically, you can... Here's like the schedule, I guess in quotes.
[02:41.22]If it's been like four days in a row of streaming, I'm probably not going to stream the next like two days.
[02:50.86]That's kind of how it's been happening, right?
[02:53.35]I usually go like four or five days in a row and then I don't do it for like two or three days.
[02:59.04]What is this rock doing here, though?
[03:01.78]So should I just pick these up?
[03:03.14]Because these don't produce anything in the wintertime, right?
[03:05.95]Should I just get rid of them?
[03:07.85]Store them?
[03:08.25]Because they're kind of an eyesore?
[03:19.43]It's too cold.
[03:21.17]No, you know what?
[03:21.65]I'm going to give this to the dog.
[03:24.61]He's right here.
[03:26.26]The dog can now be warm and cozy.
[03:30.36]He's going to love this.
[03:31.70]Watch.
[03:33.48]Ah, he can curl up right here and he's got a nice warm fire.
[03:42.06]I'll store them.
[03:46.12]I'll put these in the fridge.
[03:50.50]Right?
[03:51.38]They can be nice and cold.
[03:54.43]What else should I put in the fridge?
[03:55.63]Probably these sashimi.
[03:58.15]Although I'm going to keep a couple.
[04:00.13]I'll keep three.
[04:08.57]I don't want any of this right now.
[04:09.69]I don't need it.
[04:10.44]But I'm going to keep it for the spring.
[04:16.44]The last thing I did was I upgraded all my tools.
[04:22.16]Why do I have all this?
[04:23.26]Oh, I just was in the mine, that's why.
[04:24.64]Makes sense.
[04:40.04]Actually, no, I want to sell that.
[04:43.30]Sell monster loot.
[04:44.14]Always.
[04:44.88]Always.
[04:48.83]Where's the other mine?
[04:49.47]Didn't I get a bunch of ghost loot?
[04:51.92]Did I sell that already?
[04:54.32]Yeah, I did.
[04:57.36]Okie dokie.
[04:57.88]Let's go to the mine.
[05:03.50]Stop making me stay up.
[05:05.17]I'm not making you stay up.
[05:06.77]That is your choice.
[05:13.29]Ooh.
[05:14.91]Crocus.
[05:15.15]Crocus.
[05:17.67]Flower that can bloom in the winter.
[05:19.04]Okay.
[05:21.88]Can I buy those photos?
[05:24.62]They don't exist.
[05:27.72]They were trashed.
[05:36.06]Whoa, what?
[05:37.70]What's going on here?
[05:42.32]Is she playing video games?
[05:45.07]Is she playing E.T.?
[05:46.57]It looks like E.T.
[05:51.07]Why is this happening right now?
[05:54.93]I didn't sneak into anybody's room.
[05:58.71]Did I?
[05:59.17]I didn't even mean to.
[06:00.23]I must have blacked out or something.
[06:01.71]I just, like, was in her room.
[06:02.63]That was weird.
[06:05.07]That's scary.
[06:05.85]Okay, uh, sure.
[06:10.52]Journey of the Prairie King for hours and I can't even beat the first level.
[06:14.46]Game is ridiculously hard.
[06:18.14]Either that or I'm just terrible at it.
[06:21.60]Do you want me to beat the level for you?
[06:22.64]Is that what you're gonna say?
[06:26.22]I think I might do better with your help.
[06:27.24]Yeah, I'll beat this level.
[06:28.66]Watch this.
[06:34.74]So do I just have to beat the level?
[06:37.10]What is this?
[06:37.58]Wow, this is... I wish this was part of the actual game.
[06:46.70]This is a fun game that's built into the game.
[06:53.35]Two-player mode.
[06:54.97]Get the coins.
[06:55.47]What are we fighting here?
[07:03.45]Are these supposed to be orcs?
[07:13.06]Come on, you couldn't beat this by yourself.
[07:15.26]You really needed my help.
[07:20.02]This hasn't been all that difficult yet.
[07:25.51]Halfway done.
[07:26.29]Okay.
[07:28.27]Can I buy something with a co- Oh, extra life!
[07:34.11]I'm gonna perfect this.
[07:35.81]Now I'm gonna get touched.
[07:36.59]I apparently have a shotgun, too, that I don't even care to use.
[07:40.41]Who cares?
[07:41.82]I don't even use it.
[07:42.34]You know what this reminds me of?
[07:47.20]Smash TV.
[07:49.34]You wanna know a game that I wish they would remake?
[07:51.24]It's that.
[07:52.94]Who remembers Smash TV?
[07:56.08]That game was so hard, but it was so much fun.
[07:58.18]What?
[07:58.36]Did you really just die?
[08:01.10]You just stood still.
[08:03.02]Why would you stand still?
[08:04.20]Hey, we did it.
[08:08.38]Yeah!
[08:14.84]What did I get?
[08:15.30]Hey, that was fun.
[08:20.18]Yeah, it sure was.
[08:24.27]Well, thanks, Greg.
[08:24.95]You seem to really know your way around a joystick, huh?
[08:27.73]Oh, boy.
[08:30.41]I guess so.
[08:34.17]I guess that makes sense.
[08:40.49]Did somebody just subscribe?
[08:42.99]Hold on a second.
[08:44.39]Twitch alerts.
[08:44.85]Are you really messed up again?
[08:45.89]James Fluke B. James Fluke B with a subscription.
[08:50.66]Thanks, man.
[08:51.08]I don't know why it didn't pop up.
[08:52.84]Why is it happening again?
[08:55.08]Come on.
[08:57.36]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[09:01.92]There we go.
[09:02.93]I don't know why it didn't work.
[09:04.01]Let me just test to make sure it's working.
[09:08.99]Huh.
[09:11.47]Well, that should be working, but it's not.
[09:15.13]Well, you got the sound there, but thanks a lot for subscribing.
[09:19.09]I don't know why Twitch Alerts likes to just not work like 30% of the time you ever use it.
[09:31.25]Wasn't working earlier.
[09:32.27]Well, whatever.
[09:34.03]I apologize in advance.
[09:34.99]I'll try not to miss anybody if you subscribe.
[09:40.71]That video has comments about me?
[09:47.21]It should be comments about Orson.
[09:50.74]So what did that even do?
[09:53.76]Can I go hang out with her now?
[09:56.14]I can go in her room.
[09:56.76]What does she have?
[09:59.34]A gopher?
[10:00.58]Guinea pig?
[10:04.52]That's a Super Nintendo.
[10:06.52]Look at that thing.
[10:08.30]Oh, the golden years.
[10:09.26]The golden years of gaming.
[10:11.39]Super NES.
[10:16.47]Okay, I wanted to sell some of this stuff.
[10:19.15]Before I was interrupted.
[10:20.57]Before I was interrupted by a video game session with Abigail.
[10:38.25]Always check the trash.
[10:40.73]Ah.
[10:40.83]Alright, let's get to the bottom of the well.
[10:47.57]Save it to the bottom.
[10:48.26]See if we can find the ring girl.
[11:04.03]Finally beat The Witcher 3.
[11:05.99]Isn't that game like 200,000 hours long?
[11:14.50]Raise your celestial objects.
[11:22.71]I want to look at this, because I want more additions, because I have money.
[11:25.95]What do I need?
[11:29.81]I can increase the size of your house and add a nursery.
[11:33.51]Nursery?
[11:33.97]I don't have any kids.
[11:37.43]So I can make this.
[11:38.07]This is for coot dwelling animals.
[11:39.42]300 wood, 100 stone.
[11:39.96]Okay.
[11:46.04]We're just buying this shit.
[11:47.83]It's gonna be, what, 3,000?
[11:49.37]I don't even care.
[11:49.89]Is there a way I can make this go faster?
[11:57.49]There has to be a way I can do this faster, right?
[12:00.80]Oh, well.
[12:01.98]It's worth dropping, like, a couple thousand.
[12:04.20]I got plenty of money.
[12:04.92]I don't even want to chop trees down with gears.
[12:15.16]You hear how fast I'm clicking this?
[12:20.11]Shift-click.
[12:21.11]What is that on a controller?
[12:22.19]It's gonna get 400.
[12:27.39]Have a little extra.
[12:29.77]I already have... No, I have stone.
[12:34.19]You know what?
[12:34.51]I'm just too lazy to go back and get it.
[12:35.83]I don't care.
[12:37.00]I'm just buying 100.
[12:42.42]Let's do it.
[12:45.73]please wait wait hold on for barn for coop why do I need this I already have like the water allows you to cut and store grass for feed somebody told me this was important slime hutch well this is what I want I wanted the chicken coop because I need to make mayonnaise
[13:14.47]Right?
[13:15.21]Let's do it.
[13:21.58]Yeah, I clearly knew about it.
[13:22.52]I was just doing speed training.
[13:27.14]So this is for milk, I'm going to assume, right?
[13:30.44]What's better right now?
[13:31.66]Because I can get another 50 stone.
[13:33.82]Should I get a barn or a coop?
[13:35.66]Which one will provide me with more interesting things to do?
[13:44.72]Without a silo, I can't even feed animals.
[13:46.49]Well, how much is that?
[13:48.17]Does she sell clay?
[13:49.83]Do you sell clay?
[13:55.39]Plasma TV?
[13:56.19]No, I don't want it.
[13:59.29]No, she doesn't sell clay.
[14:05.05]Well, I'll just... Alright, I'll just get clay and build the silo and prepare.
[14:11.73]I will prepare.
[14:18.04]To the mine we go.
[14:25.18]Use my hoe.
[14:27.52]I'll do that next time.
[14:31.00]Oh, Linus, hey.
[14:33.80]I want to give you something.
[14:34.48]We've got to be friends.
[14:41.50]Please don't destroy my tent.
[14:42.68]Why do you always think I'm going to do that?
[14:44.78]Look, here, I bought you some...
[14:47.66]I brought you some sashimi.
[14:50.42]We can share it.
[14:52.67]This is a great gift.
[14:53.37]You're very welcome.
[14:57.81]Now... What do you have to say?
[15:02.12]Okay, fine.
[15:03.50]It's hard to get people to like you in this game.
[15:05.42]It really is.
[15:15.65]I gotta take a picture with the tree.
[15:16.83]I mean, it does have some pretty interesting moss.
[15:23.91]Floor 80.
[15:28.20]Fire zone.
[15:28.74]Is this a magician?
[15:36.79]What the hell?
[15:37.17]Oh my, these dudes like shooting beams!
[15:41.79]Since when are they like shamans in this game?
[15:43.57]I'm getting my ass kicked.
[15:44.49]I need to pay attention here.
[15:45.53]Is he just healing everybody?
[15:51.62]Okay.
[15:58.12]Jeez.
[15:58.56]This is the first enemy type that's actually given me a little bit of a problem.
[16:04.75]I don't even know what the hell they did.
[16:06.89]Is that gold?
[16:09.63]I think that's gold.
[16:11.43]Yes.
[16:13.31]Oh shit.
[16:17.43]Sorry, I got sashimi.
[16:18.25]I'm fine.
[16:26.03]Get away.
[16:28.92]I'm outta here.
[16:33.08]Forget it.
[16:46.36]Got a Geodude.
[16:48.04]I'm happy about that.
[16:52.87]Another one.
[16:57.19]Oh god.
[16:57.69]I'm getting hurt a lot.
[16:59.61]I gotta stop being such a complacent fool.
[17:02.59]I need a better weapon.
[17:09.16]Where's my better weapons?
[17:10.08]Didn't I just buy this?
[17:14.21]It's taking me like four swings to kill a fucking bat.
[17:20.13]Do I have to just keep getting these stupid wave enemies?
[17:23.57]I want to explore this area.
[17:27.43]Okay, well now I have to eat this.
[17:33.96]That was annoying.
[17:36.60]Takes too long to kill these things now.
[17:41.56]Anything else down here?
[17:48.87]I kind of don't even want to look.
[17:56.65]Might be worth it, though.
[18:02.79]My energy seems to be doing very well.
[18:07.53]Yeah, I totally missed.
[18:08.25]I just got an Omnigeo dude.
[18:18.96]You take forever to kill.
[18:20.64]Let's just go.
[18:28.59]Cave carrots.
[18:30.57]Those are the most delicious.
[18:36.39]How much gold do I have now?
[18:38.76]I think I can make a gold bar for the first time ever.
[18:41.66]Oh, come on.
[18:45.46]I'm going to sneeze.
[18:46.86]I'm sorry.
[18:49.38]There was no hide in that one.
[18:51.18]And now I'm going to die because I'm sneezing.
[18:54.32]Here comes another one.
[18:56.57]I don't want to sneeze.
[18:59.67]I don't want to die in the cave.
[19:02.11]My allergies.
[19:02.81]Oh, here comes another one.
[19:10.34]It's going to happen.
[19:11.72]It's going to explode out of me and there's nothing I can do about it.
[19:16.74]Excuse me.
[19:21.18]so badly wants to happen to.
[19:22.58]Another Omnigeo dude.
[19:31.15]Perfect.
[19:33.97]Perfect.
[19:35.90]Perfect.
[19:46.81]That's what we call a hee-hee.
[19:48.17]What's this?
[19:49.65]Fire quartz.
[19:50.47]Two of them.
[19:52.05]I feel like that's something I need to keep.
[19:56.21]So I can make refined fire quartz now?
[20:00.05]I'm liking that.
[20:00.65]I'm gonna eat the other sashimi.
[20:08.19]Just to make sure I don't die in case I get swarmed.
[20:11.33]What was it, 85?
[20:21.62]Another shaman over there.
[20:24.88]Really?
[20:25.14]I can't line aside him?
[20:31.96]Die!
[20:32.70]Come on!
[20:36.42]I don't even know how that was just fucking possible.
[20:39.99]I hit him three times and he hit me three times.
[20:43.09]I'm gonna have to get the hell out of here.
[20:46.65]And come back with some better gear.
[20:47.97]Because this shit takes forever to kill now.
[20:54.31]And some of them even go through swings.
[20:56.73]What was that?
[20:57.09]Did you guys hear that?
[21:01.59]Was it that guy?
[21:03.83]Just making that noise?
[21:10.52]No, it was one of those radish people down there.
[21:16.10]Maybe the slingshot.
[21:16.91]That's probably what I have to do down here.
[21:23.53]Okay, well, cross your fingers.
[21:24.59]Let's hope I don't die.
[21:25.31]Oh, jeez.
[21:32.30]You know what?
[21:34.34]I'm just going to look for the exit so I can get to 85 and then leave.
[21:38.92]Hopefully it's up here.
[21:47.16]Damn it, it's not up here.
[21:52.36]I don't want to go down that room.
[21:54.45]Even though there's... I think there's gold in there.
[21:58.15]I do have those carrots.
[22:00.71]Where are they?
[22:03.71]Don't I need these for like a quest or something?
[22:05.80]Okay, I'm not scared anymore.
[22:12.48]I just was.
[22:12.96]Let's go.
[22:18.93]I'm going in swinging.
[22:23.12]Are you serious?
[22:30.36]What?
[22:31.74]What the fuck?
[22:32.54]Did that just... That was a boomerang shot?
[22:35.40]That just came from the other side of the map.
[22:46.27]God, that was... What the hell?
[22:47.31]That was so stupid.
[22:57.06]Come on.
[22:58.02]Yes.
[23:01.54]Anything in the immediate... Nope.
[23:03.10]Time to go.
[23:08.75]Time for bed.
[23:10.57]Back to bed.
[23:14.05]Bedtime.
[23:21.67]I got plenty of time.
[23:22.53]I'm fine.
[23:23.15]I got so much energy, too.
[23:29.23]What changed, by the way?
[23:32.79]Typically, even if I did eat, like, five items, I would be at, like, 10% energy right now.
[23:41.45]I'm going to check and see if we have any fruit over here.
[23:44.91]Oh, yeah.
[23:47.77]Spicy berries.
[23:52.39]Yeah, I glow like the sun because I have two of these glow rings on.
[24:00.32]Glowing, in fact, a little too much.
[24:02.58]Actually, no.
[24:03.00]They don't really stack, I don't think.
[24:05.89]Okay.
[24:06.93]Good night.
[24:19.83]Yeah, berries.
[24:21.38]Gotta get some berries, berries, berries.
[24:27.35]I can probably go get some of these Geodudes looked at.
[24:30.23]That's what I'm going to do.
[24:33.23]I have a lot of resources, too.
[24:44.68]Selling some of this shit.
[24:46.16]In fact, most of it is going to go.
[24:47.71]Rosentier.
[24:54.23]Yeah.
[24:55.43]I'm selling 95% of this stuff.
[25:00.68]Let's get the gold in there.
[25:03.14]Okay.
[25:05.38]Where's my... Where's my hoe?
[25:17.69]Okey-dokey.
[25:21.64]Got some mail.
[25:23.44]I've got an unusual request.
[25:24.48]Could you keep this a secret?
[25:25.80]I want you to deliver an amethyst to Emily.
[25:27.92]It's her favorite stone.
[25:28.82]Tell her it's from me.
[25:31.68]How come I have to do all the legwork?
[25:36.52]So wait, I have to go get a stone and give it to Emily?
[25:42.32]And lie and say that Clint got it and wanted to give it to her?
[25:47.73]That doesn't seem right.
[25:50.40]No, I'm not going to do that.
[25:52.60]I'm not doing it.
[26:03.19]Whoops.
[26:06.73]Somehow this lake is not frozen, which is kind of interesting.
[26:15.80]No, only two perfect ones.
[26:17.14]That's great.
[26:19.19]Uh, Frozen Tear.
[26:20.31]I'm just gonna sell that.
[26:21.47]I don't care.
[26:28.89]Emerald.
[26:29.23]I can donate this.
[26:31.85]Okay, we're gonna go donate.
[26:33.13]Break open the Geodudes.
[26:46.86]After 100 hours in this game, you still like watching people play it?
[26:50.44]It's kind of just a chill game.
[26:51.56]It's just interesting and fun.
[26:55.29]I already missed his birthday.
[26:58.13]Don't care about any of these people.
[26:59.33]What is this?
[27:00.27]The Festival of Ice is in a couple days.
[27:04.37]Uh, okay.
[27:06.27]Sounds fun.
[27:07.63]Wait, what was the quest?
[27:15.56]Three albacore?
[27:19.56]No.
[27:21.20]I'm on a mission.
[27:22.18]The mission is to get to the bottom of the well.
[27:26.33]Have I married Pam?
[27:27.17]No, I have not.
[27:27.87]You can't marry Pam.
[27:28.73]She's already taken.
[27:31.73]She already has a hubby.
[27:33.01]That's what they call it, right?
[27:41.12]Do I wait until 9 a.m.
[27:42.00]anyways?
[27:42.36]Might as well fish.
[27:53.91]Oh, come on.
[27:54.39]I hate when they go super erratic.
[27:59.39]They go, up, down, up, down.
[28:06.25]Plot to kill her husband.
[28:10.00]I don't think it's that type of game.
[28:14.72]Gotta go.
[28:15.08]Good luck on your well mission.
[28:16.96]Well, commanders, thanks for stopping by.
[28:29.72]Have you ever smoked a Twix?
[28:30.96]I'm not sure why you would do such a thing.
[28:35.87]No, the answer is no.
[28:36.53]Okay, I gotta get this to almost all the way and then shoot up and get the chest.
[28:44.83]There we go.
[28:45.51]Ooh, a little too high.
[28:56.79]There we are.
[28:59.58]What's in the box?
[29:01.10]Two stone.
[29:01.78]Good.
[29:02.14]Great.
[29:08.54]You.
[29:09.95]Process my geodes.
[29:15.03]Ooh.
[29:17.05]Dolomite.
[29:19.31]One piece of coal.
[29:20.17]Great.
[29:22.45]And a frozen booger.
[29:24.56]Limestone.
[29:28.59]That's not bad.
[29:29.29]It's okay.
[29:33.13]Star shards.
[29:35.42]Well, some of these are new.
[29:36.20]I actually have a lot to donate, don't I?
[29:42.38]Gold watering can.
[29:47.85]Hold on.
[29:48.23]Do you have anything else?
[29:52.33]No, I don't want to do any of that right now.
[29:58.82]Don't open geodes unless you have a maximum luck.
[30:03.06]So I'm supposed to throw the entire game, hold on to every geode I've ever picked up the entire time I've played?
[30:08.86]I don't know if I want to do that, even if it is a better chance.
[30:20.11]New reward.
[30:26.41]Giant teddy bear?
[30:29.98]What?
[30:31.16]Okay, I get a giant bear and a singing stone.
[30:34.39]I need to see what this does.
[30:39.55]Oh, another annoying thing to annoy townspeople with.
[30:54.90]Alright, that was fun.
[30:56.70]Can I donate this?
[31:01.68]Limestone.
[31:02.48]Can I donate anything else?
[31:05.86]Star shards.
[31:10.10]I have two other things to donate.
[31:18.13]Limestone.
[31:21.25]And star shards.
[31:24.92]Okay.
[31:25.08]Okay.
[31:30.92]So at some point I do need to organize that, because that was not really... All these things are out of place.
[31:36.48]Okay.
[31:46.09]Back to the mine.
[31:46.73]Because I do want to get to the bottom sooner rather than later.
[31:51.33]Plenty of food.
[31:54.79]And plenty of time.
[31:56.77]In fact, I'm going to eat this fish right now.
[32:00.05]Just to get up to as close to max energy as I can.
[32:13.93]Jeremiah, is it really that hard to make Jupiter?
[32:17.59]No, not necessarily.
[32:18.45]I just haven't really had time to do it.
[32:19.94]I've been kind of... No, hold on a second.
[32:23.02]I need to... I want to open up these potholes.
[32:33.82]Like this one right here.
[32:36.40]Oh, come on.
[32:36.92]There's got to be something in one of these holes.
[32:45.69]Are you the Jerma985?
[32:47.19]No, that's my twin brother.
[32:51.05]My name's, uh... Germany.
[32:56.35]Worms, worms, worms.
[33:00.34]Those weren't worms, those were stones.
[33:03.68]Uh... Those were definitely worms.
[33:08.64]But, okay.
[33:10.96]I'll... go with it.
[33:24.31]Ugh.
[33:26.13]I'm gonna be scary when I get to 90, because these things really are taking forever to kill.
[33:32.91]And then we're almost at the bottom.
[33:35.07]Just a matter of time.
[33:44.46]Thought you were Jerry.
[33:47.58]Well, Germany's my nickname.
[33:49.34]My real name is Jerry.
[33:55.56]Yeah, it's Jerry Tim Squeaky Squawk Toodle Dudes.
[34:00.78]We came to that conclusion the other night.
[34:05.44]What's the point of this game?
[34:06.26]Uh, there really is none.
[34:09.40]That I've come to see.
[34:12.88]It's pretty much you have, what is it, like three years to make a farm as good as you can.
[34:19.40]And there's people you can meet along the way, you can make friends, you can marry people.
[34:24.40]It's kind of just a game that you chill and relax and play.
[34:29.63]Try to make money.
[34:31.51]Design a farm.
[34:33.93]I don't even know if there's an ending.
[34:35.79]There probably is.
[34:37.61]Do you get graded on your farm at the very end?
[34:39.35]Like how much money you made and how much money you spent or something?
[34:44.61]That'd be kind of cool.
[34:45.21]That'd be kind of sweet.
[34:52.23]You know what I mean?
[34:52.67]That'd be super sweet.
[34:54.73]Like vanilla bean ice cream.
[34:59.26]You can just play forever?
[35:00.08]That's cool.
[35:02.56]So theoretically, you can just make like a hundred million dollars if you just keep playing over the years.
[35:08.31]Whoa.
[35:13.59]Haha, you're nude.
[35:14.29]Just smash his naked body.
[35:24.62]More gold.
[35:25.72]Another glow ring.
[35:28.42]Can something else drop but a glow ring?
[35:32.49]That is number three.
[35:33.21]I'm just gonna go sell it to the Adventurer's Guild.
[35:37.27]Can you?
[35:41.19]Sub.
[35:41.49]Oh, did I miss a sub?
[35:42.57]Hold on.
[35:43.03]Sub notification is off.
[35:44.11]Yeah, something's happening with Twitch alerts.
[35:45.78]Did I miss somebody?
[35:48.46]I hope not.
[35:50.80]I'm trying to look up right now.
[35:55.26]Uh... I missed a resub.
[35:58.00]No!
[35:58.55]Where?
[35:58.83]Are you serious?
[36:01.39]Yes.
[36:04.40]There we go.
[36:05.54]Ramboned.
[36:06.94]Ramboned.
[36:07.74]You have subscribed for three months straight.
[36:10.98]Here, I'll play you the sound just because I have it on hand.
[36:15.01]The French champagne has been celebrated for its excellence.
[36:19.39]Got cut off a little bit there, but thanks for resubbing for three months.
[36:23.51]Appreciate it.
[36:34.10]Anything else down here that I missed?
[36:37.40]Should probably eat something in a minute here.
[36:39.04]Uh, it looks like there's something might be down there.
[36:49.52]God, these guys go so far when they dash.
[36:54.44]I'm stuck on the rock.
[36:55.66]I was just glitched into that rock.
[36:57.38]I'm fucking dying.
[36:58.10]I don't even give a shit.
[37:01.10]Whatever is down there, I don't care.
[37:02.54]Just eat the sashimi and leave.
[37:11.17]Would I recommend this game?
[37:11.99]Absolutely.
[37:12.41]Highly recommend this game.
[37:14.56]It is a blast.
[37:16.68]Oh, shit.
[37:17.26]A Goomba.
[37:19.66]I got a... It's an armored Goomba.
[37:22.42]These guys die pretty quick.
[37:26.83]Can I kill this guy?
[37:27.65]Do I have to break his shell?
[37:29.43]Whoa!
[37:30.93]What is he dropping?
[37:36.35]I do not understand.
[37:39.18]Maybe I can't kill him.
[37:42.33]I'm trying to break his shell.
[37:44.23]Come on, what's on the inside?
[37:45.15]What kind of creamy goodness is in there?
[37:47.71]Okay, time to go.
[37:48.61]Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[37:50.21]Okay, he's dead.
[37:56.25]That's a new ore.
[37:57.93]I have not seen before.
[38:09.56]Two diamonds.
[38:12.54]I feel like that's a big deal.
[38:15.62]Is that a big deal?
[38:16.22]I feel like it is.
[38:16.76]I'm in an awkward spot to fight this thing right now.
[38:29.41]Hey, I can see that.
[38:30.11]Leather Jacket.
[38:31.44]Subscribe for five months in a row.
[38:34.50]Thanks, Jacket.
[38:37.40]One of my much appreciated mods is Leather Jacket.
[39:00.92]I love that heel noise.
[39:02.68]That heel noise sounds like something from Chrono Trigger.
[39:05.89]Or like a Final Fantasy game.
[39:07.67]A plus sound design.
[39:18.85]I should be able to get to 90.
[39:19.61]I think, right?
[39:20.67]Or I hope.
[39:21.77]Hope so.
[39:26.53]Yeah, I apologize.
[39:27.37]No sub sounds, I guess.
[39:28.41]Twitch alerts is broken.
[39:31.10]It was broken last time, too.
[39:32.27]I... I can't... I can't say I'm too pleased about that.
[39:39.48]But whatever.
[39:40.82]Shit happens.
[40:00.90]Gold.
[40:05.22]I actually really like wintertime because there's no pressure to have anything to grow.
[40:09.64]You can just mine and make friends.
[40:18.96]Get rid of this asshole.
[40:26.19]Anything else up here?
[40:29.09]Gold.
[40:31.62]I will take it.
[40:34.88]And that's it.
[40:40.64]It's a Twitch issue.
[40:41.62]Whoa, hold on.
[40:42.17]I'm looking at chat.
[40:43.59]I'm not going to read what you said, Jacket.
[40:46.47]You said, it's a Twitch issue as far as I know from the migrating the site to SSH.
[40:52.83]Oh, well.
[40:59.34]Another emerald.
[41:00.26]Good, because I lost the one I just had.
[41:01.86]To the Museum of Fine Arts.
[41:06.10]There's another one.
[41:09.08]Wonderful.
[41:12.45]Get fucking stabbed.
[41:13.09]Good.
[41:22.02]Get in the choke point.
[41:22.82]So I don't have to come out and attack you.
[41:31.41]And there it is.
[41:36.44]Watch the time.
[41:37.04]Yeah, good, good, good reminder.
[41:39.20]Because I was not.
[41:41.96]I got plenty of time, though.
[41:42.72]I'm good.
[41:45.32]Got enough time to get the rest of this ore and then leave.
[41:48.34]And eat the psychedelic mushroom that's down here.
[41:53.30]And see shit.
[41:56.85]I can't wait to take that psychedelic mushroom and have a conversation with Elvis.
[42:02.30]It's gonna be great.
[42:07.47]Chest.
[42:10.45]Obsidian edge.
[42:14.33]Okay, place your bets.
[42:15.13]Is this better or worse than the thing that I bought, like, four hours ago?
[42:18.50]22 to 29.
[42:19.22]Ooh!
[42:19.32]Okay, it's better.
[42:26.02]It's way better.
[42:26.66]That's, like, two times better.
[42:33.75]Damn, this thing is nuts.
[42:34.89]I just want to test it out.
[42:44.25]Test it out on some poor soul down here.
[42:46.23]It's a spicy sword.
[42:51.66]Yeah, it really is.
[42:52.56]Come on, let me kill one person.
[42:56.14]I want to see the crit damage thing.
[42:58.20]Then I'll leave.
[42:58.66]There's nobody even here.
[43:02.22]I'm leaving.
[43:10.03]Leave the mine.
[43:13.55]So I'm up to 90.
[43:16.12]This would be 95 right here.
[43:17.90]This would be 100.
[43:18.26]So it looks like there's more than 100.
[43:25.48]Back to bed.
[43:32.11]Not gonna make it?
[43:32.65]Yes, I am.
[43:33.17]I have two hours to make it.
[43:39.46]No, I don't have any animals yet.
[43:41.68]Not yet.
[43:46.42]I figured I don't have a silo, and a bunch of people were telling me that without a silo, you're pretty much shit out of luck if you have animals.
[43:54.91]So, I'm just gonna get a silo first.
[43:59.90]That's next on the list.
[44:09.25]Okay.
[44:24.70]I have a lot of stuff that I don't really know what to do with.
[44:27.58]Hey, buddy.
[44:29.12]I'm gonna have to do some more organization.
[44:34.22]I just have so much stuff.
[44:38.31]Like, I just don't even know what to do with it all.
[44:49.96]Okay, I want to sell these.
[44:51.14]I'm going to get rid of these.
[44:51.88]Okay, where's my... Put my bear in here.
[44:53.20]Where's he going to go?
[44:59.16]Duh.
[45:04.11]Right here.
[45:05.83]I can't place it on top of a person.
[45:07.13]I'm not...
[45:10.65]Does this do anything?
[45:11.37]Okay, whatever I'm going to bed I can now craft bombs Sounds like a plan
[45:34.15]Sub?
[45:35.51]Nobody's saying... Oh, we got a sub.
[45:37.91]Mr. Ukulele.
[45:40.17]Five months in a row.
[45:41.36]That's a long time.
[45:42.08]Thanks, man.
[45:43.36]Appreciate it.
[45:44.60]Welcome back.
[45:51.74]These things are worth so much money, the bat wings.
[45:55.82]Welcome back.
[45:59.01]Although these really aren't worth it very much.
[46:05.99]It's too bad you can't be greeted by Orson Welles right now.
[46:08.71]Wait, I missed another sub?
[46:09.47]Yeah, you guys are going to have to keep me on top of that because I don't want to miss anybody.
[46:19.04]Mr. Kool-Aid?
[46:19.66]Is that who subbed?
[46:24.08]If you sub once and don't resub, do you keep the emotes?
[46:27.77]I do not think so.
[46:29.05]I'm pretty sure you have to stay subscribed.
[46:30.95]You have to stay co-cribed.
[46:31.89]What did I just say?
[46:32.49]What words was I saying?
[46:42.38]Give me all the gold things.
[46:48.97]I'm gonna go sell to the Adventurer's Guild as crap.
[46:52.13]Uh-oh.
[47:02.20]Hello there, Greg.
[47:03.20]So your first year in Stardew Valley is almost over, huh?
[47:06.34]If you keep buying seeds from me, you'll be twice as productive next year.
[47:10.40]And I have some exciting news.
[47:12.32]I'll be selling new seed varieties in my shop next year.
[47:15.43]Should have one new variety per season.
[47:17.85]Well, that's all I wanted to have to say.
[47:19.45]Have a good one.
[47:22.34]Oh, by the way.
[47:24.87]He really did want to say, you know, I wouldn't even bother trying to get at my competitor.
[47:29.95]They're the highest quality seeds you can find anywhere.
[47:31.70]That's a promise, motherfucker.
[47:33.04]You understand?
[47:36.80]And he's gone.
[47:40.41]Marnie?
[47:40.65]Why can I not say that word?
[47:41.45]Wow.
[47:41.55]Wow.
[47:41.69]Alright, what's on the list?
[48:11.64]How close am I to a silo?
[48:15.86]How much did I need?
[48:16.44]I'm gonna go look again.
[48:19.64]What bars do I need for a silo?
[48:25.55]I just snorted up air into the wrong pipe.
[48:30.11]I'm so sorry.
[48:32.63]Why does he sound like Bill Clinton?
[48:36.52]That was Bill Clinton?
[48:39.44]Was it?
[48:40.76]I couldn't really tell.
[48:45.20]It's hard to do with Bill Clinton.
[48:47.46]He really kind of just talks with a sort of southern twang, but... That's not very good, but it's good enough, I guess.
[49:06.57]Oh, ten clay.
[49:07.09]That's what I needed.
[49:26.16]He said he had that now?
[49:27.02]No, 9 o'clock.
[49:31.74]Trash.
[49:33.88]Goods in the trash.
[49:34.48]Come on.
[49:41.30]Okay, I was going to the Adventurer's Guild.
[49:42.84]Then I was going to check on how much a silo was.
[49:44.64]Adventurer's Guild, they're both up here.
[49:51.29]So, you know, we're just going to go straight up.
[49:58.24]We want Rat Movie 3.
[50:02.24]I don't know what to say.
[50:05.85]I'm going to have to wait until I potentially feel like making another one.
[50:16.99]Ooh, hold on.
[50:17.51]Where's the hole?
[50:18.85]There it is.
[50:21.87]A flute?
[50:23.63]What can I do with this?
[50:24.63]Can I play it?
[50:25.11]Oh, I can give it to Gunther.
[50:37.01]Let's play Hitman.
[50:39.13]Um... Yeah, I don't know.
[50:43.17]Hitman looks fun, but it just doesn't... I mean... Isn't there like only one mission out right now?
[50:55.55]I feel like I'd get really into it and then be very upset.
[50:59.29]Five copper bars is the only other thing I needed besides the clay.
[51:01.71]Okay.
[51:01.83]Okay.
[51:12.41]remake B movie with my voice instead of Jerry Seinfeld?
[51:15.36]I feel like that movie would be terrible.
[51:24.20]Castle Griffin's need closed beta.
[51:26.18]That's funny.
[51:33.04]Hey.
[51:34.65]The gridball game is on today.
[51:39.05]Shut up.
[51:45.29]I don't even know what the fuck I'm doing right now.
[51:46.71]I was gonna go to... ...the blacksmith.
[51:51.77]I have a thing to donate.
[51:56.06]Yeah, we're gonna donate this.
[52:03.72]Yeah, the next, the next Jerma wrestling thing is coming out in May.
[52:06.78]Just hold your horses.
[52:11.02]Hold your horses.
[52:15.77]All I can ask is for you to be patient.
[52:17.35]That's the only thing I can ask.
[52:18.45]Dude, did I have any... Thought I had something to give you.
[52:24.73]No, I don't.
[52:33.26]I've got a flute for you.
[52:36.14]Just picked it up out of the ground.
[52:38.38]Yes!
[52:39.10]What do you got?
[52:45.88]flute block?
[52:48.24]Okay.
[52:49.44]Another one of these, huh?
[53:20.23]What is with these annoying toys that you get?
[53:32.28]I wish I had my drum set so I could play an actual song.
[53:42.22]Alright, back to the mine, right?
[53:43.44]Because I need to go to the Adventurer's Guild.
[53:47.32]That's what I'm gonna do.
[53:49.56]Wahoo!
[53:52.00]Here we go.
[53:52.56]Here we go.
[53:58.20]Here we go.
[54:03.82]Key mashing intensifies you.
[54:06.61]Sometimes you just have to smash the keys.
[54:19.69]So, anyway, anytime I walk around in this game, I'm not looking at the screen.
[54:23.96]I'm looking at the chat.
[54:25.22]So, with my peripheral, I'm trying to navigate.
[54:27.90]Half the time, I'm walking around this town.
[54:29.40]It's fun.
[54:31.68]Hold on.
[54:32.82]Worms.
[54:35.60]There's some clay.
[54:36.22]You know what I mean?
[54:38.44]Like, whoa.
[54:40.34]These are meat.
[54:48.22]What do you mean by meat?
[54:50.63]I don't want to use that meat.
[54:54.09]I want to sell some bunch of random toys to this guy.
[54:59.37]2 p.m.?
[54:59.75]Alright, I'll catch a fish.
[55:02.99]Easy said and done.
[55:11.76]Stop reading the stuff we say.
[55:12.78]All we want you to do is bomb your farm.
[55:17.40]At this point, that wouldn't really do anything.
[55:25.78]Large mouth bass.
[55:29.42]Cool.
[55:33.85]Steel.
[55:34.49]Ooh.
[55:37.11]Bone sword?
[55:41.17]I hate how I can't see, like, the actual damage on that.
[55:43.17]This is 30 to 45, 10 crit power.
[55:48.91]Nah, the one I have is way better.
[55:52.90]Although, Dark Boots.
[55:55.37]Ooh, those are nice.
[55:56.47]The ones I have on are what?
[56:01.49]3 and 3?
[56:01.63]What are those, 4 and 2?
[56:03.31]4 and, yeah.
[56:09.88]Weapon Precision.
[56:10.66]Critical Strike Chance.
[56:12.42]Critical Strike Power.
[56:16.93]Weapon speed.
[56:18.93]Attack by 10%.
[56:19.53]I kind of want the critical strike one.
[56:22.37]I have all these stupid glow rings.
[56:28.51]Yeah, I'm gonna buy the crit ring.
[56:34.78]10% more crit.
[56:37.34]I'm doing it.
[56:37.74]I'm gonna sell the other stupid one I have, this glow ring.
[56:41.84]Because that's the only thing I found.
[56:47.28]all the things to find.
[56:48.34]That's the only one I have.
[56:49.22]I can zoom out in the options?
[56:52.38]What do you mean?
[56:57.19]Zoom out.
[57:02.59]Can you kill people in this game?
[57:03.55]No.
[57:06.27]What does that guy want me to show him?
[57:09.07]I can show you something.
[57:09.85]You want to see something?
[57:10.55]I'll put a show on for you right now, buddy.
[57:19.05]What do you think about that?
[57:29.20]I put this guy to sleep He just did not care Okay I bored the shit out of that guy
[57:48.65]That was great. 91
[58:18.10]My tools!
[58:21.18]I've gotta have my tools!
[58:27.19]Another emerald.
[58:30.85]Ooh.
[58:32.15]Free iron from that dude.
[58:36.49]I'm seeing the tracks here.
[58:37.95]Dude, eventually when I get down here I can activate the minecart.
[58:41.21]And what does that do?
[58:46.46]Am I an actual fan of wrestling?
[58:48.88]Not anymore, but like 15 to 20 years ago, I loved wrestling.
[58:57.89]It was my life.
[59:00.03]When I was like 15 or 16 years old, I absolutely adored that sport.
[59:05.69]Just the theater and like the drama.
[59:08.07]It was like a soap opera.
[59:09.39]It was just fantastic.
[59:10.27]And all like the weird storylines and characters that they had.
[59:14.61]The WWF attitude era was... It was just incredible.
[59:19.15]And it was just amazing TV.
[59:22.49]I don't think anything could ever compare to the WWF and the WCW back in like 1996.
[59:27.47]It was the best.
[59:30.87]Ah, here's the cart.
[59:34.84]Can I just push this?
[59:36.06]Send it back?
[59:36.52]What can I do with this thing?
[59:40.20]I don't know, whatever.
[59:45.78]You know, now... This is what I feel like now about wrestling.
[59:50.09]They stepped away in recent years, like the last 10 years, probably, I'd say, from the interesting, quirky characters.
[60:00.59]The last time I watched wrestling, it was, like, guy with a first and last name in underwear versus another guy with a first and last name in underwear.
[60:09.57]Oh, here comes, like, Steve Johnson!
[60:11.34]And he's gonna be taking on, like, Arthur Robertson!
[60:14.77]Both of them are wearing underwear.
[60:17.05]That's it.
[60:21.59]Don't forget for the main event, we have another guy, but this time he's in green underwear.
[60:27.28]You think that's exciting?
[60:28.42]This next guy's in gray underwear.
[60:34.60]Oh, we've banned all the cool shit, by the way.
[60:38.16]You can no longer do any of the interesting moves.
[60:43.06]We've banned them.
[60:51.66]Stone Cold Steve Austin.
[60:58.75]I don't think that was wrestling.
[61:07.03]Oh shit, what was I watching?
[61:09.23]I don't even know.
[61:19.76]That's when I kind of gave up on it.
[61:24.36]I remember back in the, like, Doink the Clown, Mankind.
[61:28.32]Kane.
[61:29.04]And I'm not talking about Kane now.
[61:31.68]We're talking about horror movie Kane.
[61:34.64]With the mask on.
[61:35.65]That didn't say anything and he was terrifying.
[61:47.32]They actually, they made Kane guy in underwear.
[61:51.89]They took his mask off, and they put him in underwear.
[61:54.69]And they were like, okay, it's time for you to be an underwear guy, Kane.
[61:57.45]And he's like, okay.
[62:08.60]Yeah, the Undertaker.
[62:10.32]But then they did something weird, like Paul Bearer.
[62:13.24]God, Paul Bearer was one of my favorite people ever.
[62:16.90]The Undertaker!
[62:19.08]Kane!
[62:20.51]That was one of the best characters ever.
[62:23.57]And yeah, he just recently died.
[62:27.25]What a legend.
[62:59.78]If you've never heard Paul Bearer talk, go look up a Paul Bearer video.
[63:03.10]You'll love it.
[63:05.52]He talks just like that.
[63:07.76]And he was like a dead guy.
[63:09.68]He had his whole face painted white with like powder.
[63:15.37]It was crazy.
[63:16.11]He carried an urn that gave the Undertaker powers.
[63:23.85]It was fantastic stuff.
[63:35.68]Uh, where is this exit?
[63:44.18]Didn't they bury Paul Bearer alive in an episode of Raw?
[63:48.54]They put him in a glass cage and they buried him alive with sand.
[63:53.95]They don't do shit like that anymore.
[63:57.59]They don't bury people alive on camera anymore.
[64:05.46]You have an autographed photo of Paul Bearer?
[64:07.58]Also, I was Al Snow for Halloween in the fourth grade.
[64:11.40]He was crazy.
[64:12.76]He carried around like the head, the little doll head.
[64:14.58]Doll, you know what?
[64:20.01]Absolutely.
[64:21.07]Oh, fuck, I gotta go home.
[64:21.89]Gotta go home.
[64:22.61]Go.
[64:24.91]Uh, that's a, that's a Paul Bearer subsound.
[64:28.35]Absolutely.
[64:28.75]Go, you, absolutely.
[64:30.80]Absolutely.
[64:34.78]Completely and totally.
[64:35.98]100% yes.
[64:41.02]I gotta find a good one.
[64:45.01]That'll be like a resub sound or something.
[64:46.89]Absolutely.
[64:48.27]I can't wait to go get that now.
[64:59.82]It's gonna be him screaming something about Kane.
[65:04.16]No, that's gonna be great.
[65:10.00]I cannot wait for that But yeah, I mean wrestling kind of also back when like Vince McMahon was the ultimate villain
[65:25.27]Slime egg press?
[65:27.78]Okie dokie.
[65:29.70]Vince McMahon was such a great villain.
[65:31.16]He was a super villain.
[65:32.26]He essentially was Norman Osborn.
[65:37.50]Right?
[65:38.01]Super rich guy with like all this power.
[65:41.29]If he put on a green suit and a mask, he could have been the Green Goblin.
[65:44.47]He was just Norman Osborn.
[65:46.27]It was great.
[65:54.66]Who's the guy that used to eat the turnbuckle?
[65:58.06]George the Animal Steel, right?
[66:00.54]He used to eat the turnbuckle.
[66:03.02]He'd come into the stage, he was like a fat guy in a onesie, and he would come and he would just start biting the turnbuckle and he would rip it up and eat it.
[66:09.78]And that was a special move.
[66:11.34]He would then take somebody's head and smash it into the steel that was underneath the soft turnbuckle, which he had eaten.
[66:18.37]They don't do that anymore.
[66:20.31]Does the guy eat the turnbuckle anymore?
[66:21.59]No.
[66:21.67]No.
[66:33.16]Magnet ring?
[66:35.82]When did I get these?
[66:40.29]I don't even remember picking these up, but okay.
[66:46.25]Sell it.
[66:48.99]I'm a trash man.
[66:51.31]I come in there and I start eating garbage.
[66:56.49]Teddy DeVito.
[66:58.21]The trash man.
[67:00.97]Oh, gee shit.
[67:02.63]Did I get you, Cricket?
[67:04.73]Must have been an edge on that can.
[67:08.71]Oh, you got me.
[67:10.06]Oh, Frank, you got me.
[67:11.66]That show is fantastic, by the way.
[67:22.49]Oh, shit.
[67:22.81]Did I get you, Cricket?
[67:28.30]I'll put that back.
[67:32.34]I'll do this later.
[67:42.23]Two more rings.
[67:43.71]I don't even want this fucking thing.
[67:45.77]Ugh, fine.
[67:46.15]I'll put it in my bedroom.
[67:52.76]Put it next to the funny bear.
[68:00.77]So many gems for Abby to eat.
[68:02.44]Yeah, that's true.
[68:06.42]That is true.
[68:09.48]What am I, 95?
[68:18.63]You just watched a Paul Bearer?
[68:19.57]Yeah, it's great.
[68:27.20]Kane!
[68:28.36]That's definitely going to be it.
[68:30.50]Whenever he screams the word, Kane!
[68:33.87]That's the new sub sound.
[68:39.05]Locked.
[68:39.33]Let's go.
[68:42.81]Do I have any food?
[68:45.97]I have one fish.
[68:49.45]I could make some sashimi.
[68:52.09]No, we're going to go.
[68:52.87]We'll just do it.
[68:53.49]Keep it up.
[68:55.23]I can eat the fish for some energy.
[68:59.23]What the hell is going on?
[69:02.51]Star, what the hell are you doing?
[69:03.53]Are you putting Etalyx as a YouTube channel?
[69:15.32]Mod abuse.
[69:23.26]Close to 100.
[69:24.70]Let's see what happens at 100, because I'm probably going to get there.
[69:29.90]And then it's... Watch out.
[69:36.35]There's a person's face.
[69:38.97]On that moon.
[69:41.71]Oh shit, the festival's starting.
[69:47.42]Let me kill the gumball with a human face and then I'll leave.
[69:51.32]Holy shit.
[69:54.10]This guy's creeping me out.
[69:57.61]One hit and he's dead.
[69:58.27]That was so easy.
[69:59.27]Okay, well time to go to the fair.
[70:10.58]New sub icon, that face.
[70:17.31]Where the hell is this place?
[70:18.77]Where am I going?
[70:19.23]The ranch?
[70:26.17]Gotta go all the way over there.
[70:33.96]All the way around.
[70:34.84]I don't even care.
[70:36.36]Nobody likes me.
[70:48.19]What's my dog doing?
[70:53.26]There.
[70:54.10]You're okay.
[70:54.62]You want to come with me?
[70:55.90]Why can't he come with me?
[71:01.00]I should be able to take my dog wherever I want.
[71:12.73]Time for the festival.
[71:13.63]Look at these ice co- Oh, look at this!
[71:18.13]It's Cool Spot from the 90s.
[71:20.25]Remember Cool Spot?
[71:23.22]Except he's kind of a gumdrop now.
[71:24.64]He kind of got fat.
[71:25.50]He let himself go.
[71:28.46]Well.
[71:30.00]That's kind of cool.
[71:33.06]I'm entering the ice fishing competition today.
[71:34.78]Why not?
[71:35.20]Do I have bait on me?
[71:36.68]I'm going to win that.
[71:40.13]Oh, ice.
[71:40.65]A beautiful material to sculpt in, but so impermanent.
[71:46.41]I'm sorry, but carving ice.
[71:49.07]Carving ice parappa the wrapper requires my undivided attention.
[71:55.45]Okay.
[71:55.57]What about you, little boy?
[71:56.87]I saw a big fish down here.
[71:59.43]Okay, cool.
[72:01.15]Festival of ice.
[72:05.37]Cold?
[72:05.77]Nah, I never get cold.
[72:07.03]Oh, wow.
[72:09.25]So edgy.
[72:10.95]Are you gonna enter the ice fishing competition?
[72:12.31]Of course I am.
[72:13.45]And I'm gonna win.
[72:18.97]Oh, hi, Abigail.
[72:21.17]You have such a cool snow goon.
[72:26.93]Guess winter isn't all bad.
[72:27.89]Playing in the snow can be fun.
[72:30.91]Where are all your clothes?
[72:34.29]Half these people are not dressed for the occasion.
[72:38.65]I plan on winning the ice fishing competition.
[72:40.17]Pam.
[72:41.31]That is... No.
[72:41.65]Alright, let's go.
[72:47.03]I don't care about any of these clowns.
[72:51.73]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[72:54.31]I'm ready to go.
[72:56.47]Let's go.
[72:59.69]I'm going to destroy... The whole town's here.
[73:12.45]What quadrant do I get?
[73:15.30]Catch as many fish as you can possibly get in two minutes using the provided fishing rods.
[73:17.98]I don't get to use my own.
[73:18.62]Okay.
[73:20.88]What's up?
[73:28.45]Okay, you gotta be careful because you might overcast.
[73:36.87]No, none of them even have one yet.
[73:38.45]It's gonna be easy.
[73:45.43]They haven't even caught one.
[73:47.94]This is perfect.
[73:48.74]I'm gonna win this by a landslide.
[73:56.58]She got one.
[73:57.42]They're on one right now.
[74:00.76]Shit.
[74:08.11]I can't screw this up.
[74:09.35]I gotta win.
[74:17.67]I'm still ahead by at least two.
[74:19.47]Shit.
[74:31.29]I told you I was going to win by a landslide.
[74:32.97]I'm at least double.
[74:35.35]What do you get for winning this?
[74:42.11]Do I get a stardew drop?
[74:47.10]I hope so.
[74:50.94]Yeah, I knew fishing was worth it.
[74:53.14]I spent a lot of time fishing.
[74:54.36]I did.
[74:55.36]My fishing's pretty high, isn't it?
[75:09.80]Yeah.
[75:12.40]One more and I should seal the deal.
[75:14.12]Yeah, this is going to be the deal.
[75:14.96]Seal it right here.
[75:21.68]That should be it.
[75:26.71]Three, two, one, zero.
[75:29.63]Thank you for first place.
[75:34.77]Seven.
[75:35.09]The next person, the last person, but Pam got like three.
[75:43.03]Oh, that's a lot of fish.
[75:45.57]Gag the smell.
[75:46.79]Alright.
[75:52.12]Thank you for the medal.
[75:53.46]I will take a star.
[75:54.18]Do drop.
[75:57.30]Yeah.
[76:00.90]He's your prize.
[76:01.66]Huh?
[76:08.29]Increase the chance of finding treasures when fishing.
[76:10.93]However, fish aren't crazy about the taste.
[76:15.47]Alright.
[76:19.19]Thank you.
[76:19.47]Do I have to equip those or just have them in my inventory?
[76:43.01]I can't believe that.
[76:43.71]Wait, I've never spoken.
[76:44.95]That was me?
[76:46.42]I can't believe I won.
[76:47.30]Let's put the fishing hat on.
[76:48.24]Okay, now I'm just Donald Duck.
[76:55.72]Yep.
[76:58.22]We have transcended into being Donald Duck.
[77:02.11]I like it.
[77:02.45]It's fine.
[77:03.61]Good.
[77:14.39]Yeah, let me use a blue shirt.
[77:18.37]I can't really use any of this stuff right now.
[77:30.68]Donald Dump?
[77:32.76]Donald Dump.
[77:35.66]Yeah, I got my new character, Donald Dump.
[77:39.41]That's so stupid.
[77:42.57]Donald Dump.
[77:50.83]That's such a perfect description.
[78:00.12]Is there actually a Donald Duck shirt?
[78:03.08]Can I get it?
[78:03.62]I wish I could get a new shirt.
[78:16.15]Where's level 10 farming?
[78:23.03]Donald Dump It's just Donald Duck but dump at the end I love funny things.
[78:44.70]Don't you guys just love funny things?
[78:48.48]I'm a big fan of funny stuff
[79:13.26]Beautiful Okay back to the mine I was gonna do what I was going to do
[79:33.77]I did not find grandpa's note.
[79:35.43]Actually, maybe I did.
[79:36.03]I don't know.
[79:43.13]How much clay did I need?
[79:43.94]I need like four more clay and some copper bars.
[79:49.32]Yeah, I'd like the drum set.
[79:50.52]That'd be awesome if I could have the drum set right there right now.
[80:02.56]Walking around as Donald Dump.
[80:08.48]Even Charlie Brown.
[80:10.27]Yeah, I know.
[80:11.51]I'm like five characters mixed into one.
[80:19.75]I missed an hour and 20 minutes.
[80:21.25]Chrome alerts are good.
[80:23.45]There's lots of...
[80:25.79]I guess issues going on right now.
[80:27.67]I'm not sure what they all entail, but my Twitch alerts doesn't work again.
[80:33.77]And I guess people aren't getting notified of the stream sometimes now, I guess.
[80:37.76]I don't know.
[80:46.15]Donald Duck.
[80:56.66]Here comes 100 hype.
[80:57.32]100 hype.
[80:59.52]Oh my god, I'm so hyped.
[81:07.19]I'll get hyped.
[81:09.01]Hype.
[81:12.73]That word.
[81:13.25]I don't really like that word.
[81:15.90]Hey, you've tricked me.
[81:19.86]Little trickster.
[81:25.88]Oh, guys, I'm getting so hype right now.
[81:31.91]You've never been notified of my stream?
[81:34.73]Are you following?
[81:37.01]If people are following and nobody's getting notified, then that kind of stinks.
[81:39.97]Alright.
[81:57.01]Ooh, here we go.
[81:59.30]These are the really chewy ones.
[82:02.92]Alright, this is important.
[82:03.94]I gotta ask the chat.
[82:06.56]I'm making a straw poll because I need to know this.
[82:09.94]I have to know this.
[82:11.44]I need to know where we all stand here.
[82:13.72]It's important.
[82:18.74]It's an extremely important question that I need to ask.
[82:40.01]Here we go.
[82:47.69]Please vote on that poll.
[82:50.03]What's a better cookie?
[82:52.07]What's better?
[82:55.05]This is extremely important.
[82:56.41]Please vote.
[82:58.11]Get out there and vote on this poll.
[83:04.25]I want to see how we all stand on this extremely important issue.
[83:20.16]Yeah, alright, yep.
[83:21.76]Chewy.
[83:24.88]Which cookie, what's a better cookie?
[83:26.56]A crunchy, like, crispy cookie, or a chewy, soft cookie?
[83:32.51]And the people have spoken, and I agree with them.
[83:35.41]As a majority.
[83:36.77]Chewy cookies.
[83:41.75]By a lot, too.
[83:42.51]Wow, that's surprising.
[83:43.49]That's a lot.
[83:44.27]75% to 25% chewy versus crunchy.
[83:51.27]Wow.
[83:53.89]See, I thought I was... I didn't think I was part of the majority.
[84:00.57]I thought most people liked crunchy, chewy... No, crunchy, crispy cookies.
[84:13.14]That's a huge majority.
[84:17.68]Yeah, you gotta put your stock in chewy cookies, guys.
[84:37.36]I can't appreciate a crunchy cookie from time to time.
[84:41.12]I can.
[84:42.74]Because when you put them in milk, they kind of turn chewy.
[84:46.25]Not really chewy, but they turn sort of soggy and gross.
[84:50.03]But it's good.
[84:50.45]It's a good gross.
[84:51.21]You know what I mean?
[84:52.43]A crunchy cookie that's been soaking in milk is gross.
[84:55.31]But it's like a good slimy gross feeling.
[84:59.39]You kind of bite into the cookie and it like... It just disappears.
[85:03.18]It just melts into your mouth.
[85:05.38]It's like 42% gross.
[85:06.02]But the other 60... 8%.
[85:06.74]I don't know if that's the correct math.
[85:09.76]68.
[85:09.80]The other 58%.
[85:10.30]It's somewhere around 60.
[85:13.85]I don't know.
[85:14.15]I'm not a fucking mathematician. ...
[85:28.25]Red mushrooms, huh?
[85:36.84]No, it is.
[85:37.24]It's good.
[85:39.83]But it only happens with certain cookies.
[85:41.09]It doesn't happen with them all.
[85:45.36]Sometimes, what ends up happening when you have a crunchy cookie of milk, you'll hang it in there, and... Oop!
[85:51.79]What's that?
[85:52.77]Cookie's gone!
[85:53.57]You lift it up a little bit, breaks off, goes to the bottom, and then you get the sludge cookie that stays at the bottom of your milk forever.
[85:59.71]And then at the end, you're kind of timid, you don't want to drink the rest of the milk, because you know that the snot rocket that's at the bottom is gonna go down your throat, and it's gonna make you gag.
[86:12.49]So, you know, it's a give-and-take world when you eat crunchy cookies.
[86:17.39]Got more diamonds, too.
[86:19.04]Nice.
[86:31.32]Get away from me.
[86:33.68]I might not be able to make it to 100.
[86:34.60]I'm going to have to consolidate here.
[86:47.65]Zap That's the best part oh no It can it can be okay, but it really depends on what's at the bottom
[87:14.38]Anything else that I need to break?
[87:15.92]There is gold.
[87:16.56]There's a lot of gold.
[87:17.38]Good thing I came down here.
[87:18.20]I don't even want to fight this guy.
[87:31.37]Just give me your quartz.
[87:32.35]Bye.
[87:36.03]And all your coal.
[87:38.09]You rotten son of a bitch.
[87:42.46]Crunchy crew?
[87:43.14]Uh-oh, we're splitting up.
[87:47.94]We're splitting as a group.
[87:50.12]We got the crunchies versus the chewies.
[87:51.72]I don't know if I like that.
[87:55.53]We're supposed to be unified, guys.
[87:58.95]Don't let the cookie partisanship ruin it.
[88:09.39]Oh, watch out for Radish Man.
[88:13.91]So many mushrooms down here.
[88:17.13]Uh-oh.
[88:22.44]A lot of these mushrooms down here.
[88:23.74]Am I just getting lucky, or is this just happens the later levels you get to?
[88:31.73]I would say Oreo would be probably considered a crunchy cookie.
[88:35.49]Why can't a crunchy cookie say the word right?
[88:42.11]I mean, it's not... the inside isn't chewy.
[88:45.50]The inside is frosting.
[88:47.32]Frosting isn't really chewy.
[88:49.72]It's more... velvety.
[88:55.20]I would classify it as a crunchy cookie.
[89:10.35]Actually, you know what?
[89:12.10]I gotta vote for crunch here.
[89:14.06]Not a vote for crunch cookies.
[89:17.10]But, how many of you guys have been to Dairy Queen?
[89:20.74]And had their crunch coat?
[89:24.65]Any ice cream place that has the crunch coat?
[89:28.25]When I was younger, I literally probably ate a hundred pounds of Crunch Coat between the ages of like 10 years old and 20.
[89:37.78]That shit was so incredible.
[89:42.27]Crunch Coat.
[89:45.87]Oh, fuck.
[89:47.93]I'm in kind of deep shit here.
[89:54.39]Chocolate shell?
[89:55.01]No, we're talking Crunch Coat.
[89:58.26]It was almost like Captain Crunch was all over it, but it wasn't.
[90:02.38]This is an extremely dangerous room.
[90:03.94]Do I have a bomb?
[90:07.35]I think it might be time to clock out here.
[90:11.51]Nope, I gotta do it.
[90:13.35]I need to do it.
[90:17.81]Bomb.
[90:18.35]Perfect.
[90:25.51]Fuck you all.
[90:30.72]That's so much stuff.
[90:33.42]There's even like a weapon over here.
[90:40.66]No funny business.
[90:41.78]Boots, too?
[90:42.60]I'm so glad I came over here.
[90:45.91]Don't die.
[90:46.35]Hey, look at a ring that I have.
[90:52.01]A thousand of them already.
[90:56.33]What the fuck is moving?
[90:57.57]I thought that was scary.
[91:02.13]Uh-oh.
[91:04.20]Can I eat this?
[91:04.78]No.
[91:06.32]I can eat this.
[91:15.62]Okay, I can eat the crab.
[91:16.58]No, no, no, no.
[91:20.37]What is going on here?
[91:31.84]Well, that's a piece of crap.
[91:37.98]And... Uh, I don't really give a shit about the hardwood.
[91:43.24]Whatever.
[91:43.66]Just leave it there.
[91:44.20]Get to 100.
[91:44.46]Let's see what's at 100.
[91:45.36]Time for 100.
[91:45.66]100.
[91:45.68]Shit.
[91:47.48]I need to throw something away.
[91:49.62]This stupid monster loot.
[91:55.70]What is it?
[91:57.08]Ooh, it's a star drop!
[91:59.31]Yeah!
[92:00.13]Full energy.
[92:05.97]You found a star drop.
[92:06.87]It's strange, but the taste reminds you of carrots.
[92:09.31]Your maximum energy level has increased.
[92:12.96]Beautiful.
[92:15.46]Can I really fish down here?
[92:18.27]Okay.
[92:18.83]Wait, is this molten lava?
[92:21.43]Can I actually cast into this?
[92:36.84]My hands are burnt right now.
[92:39.03]That is third degree burns.
[92:40.85]Instantly, if I touch this.
[92:41.93]Alright, let's go back.
[92:46.61]Actually, I don't want to see what's 101.
[92:47.77]101.
[92:47.79]I just wanted to look at it.
[92:49.66]Even at 100, I can't get in there.
[93:04.39]driftwood yeah that's a little odd I will say if I do say so myself blood water I mean that's not against the realm of possibility that is a hundred layers deep could be directly connected to hell
[93:35.87]Nothing in here.
[93:43.09]I have some things to donate.
[93:44.09]I picked up some new items along the way.
[93:48.65]Diamonds.
[93:49.29]Yeah, I can donate this.
[94:04.84]Eleven of these.
[94:07.56]Yeah, I'll do these.
[94:13.74]Wait, did it actually work?
[94:16.32]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[94:20.99]Okay, somebody just subscribed, but it didn't show up on my screen.
[94:27.09]Talk rough.
[94:28.39]Oh, there it is.
[94:30.83]Took rough thee.
[94:33.53]Tukrofty?
[94:34.97]Tukrofty!
[94:36.49]Probably saying your name wrong.
[94:38.35]But Tukrofty?
[94:40.64]Welcome, thank you for subscribing, appreciate it.
[94:43.30]At least we get the noise.
[94:45.34]Hold on, let me see.
[94:46.12]Let me like save the settings and see if I can reload it.
[94:48.82]See if it'll work now.
[94:52.84]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[94:57.19]Alright, what about this one?
[94:59.81]The French champagne.
[95:02.37]Apparently it works.
[95:03.31]Has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[95:07.79]Alright.
[95:08.45]It should be functioning again.
[95:16.84]Okay, sell these rings.
[95:24.16]What else?
[95:27.15]Okay.
[95:30.84]Stone is over here.
[95:31.64]Get these mushrooms away.
[95:40.28]I'm going to have to do some more organization here in a minute.
[95:48.28]Yeah.
[95:53.14]Although I could give this to Abigail, right?
[95:54.90]Won't she eat this or something?
[95:57.37]Yeah, we'll hold on to it.
[96:01.24]Yeah, welcome.
[96:01.92]Welcome all the subs.
[96:02.66]All the people that subbed already.
[96:04.08]Like the three or four of you that subbed over the last hour.
[96:08.99]Welcome as well.
[96:09.71]Sorry that there was no Twitch alert for you.
[96:13.85]Get rid of this stupid crab.
[96:18.93]Donate this.
[96:20.23]Give this to Abigail and break these open.
[96:22.73]That's the agenda tomorrow.
[96:38.71]Okie-dokie.
[96:45.20]How many subs do I usually get from a stream session?
[96:49.66]I don't know.
[96:54.41]I mean... So far I've had like, I don't know, four or five?
[97:00.37]With like maybe two resubs or something?
[97:05.13]I don't know.
[97:05.43]I'm not, like, meticulously checking.
[97:07.25]Like, oh, how many subs is that?
[97:08.31]How many subs do I have now?
[97:09.21]Oh, hold on.
[97:10.35]Let me count.
[97:10.65]Let me go count again.
[97:11.63]Like, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[97:12.15]No, just... I mean, I'll check it periodically.
[97:18.22]That's Sebastian's birthday.
[97:24.54]Not giving him shit.
[97:33.94]I always check the trash.
[97:40.36]Alright, I need to go break these geodes open.
[97:44.57]Oh, hold on.
[97:45.55]Worms.
[97:48.47]I might even have enough clay now.
[97:53.75]A book.
[97:54.85]This is book.
[97:56.05]Somebody's Trapper Keeper.
[97:59.43]What?
[98:02.08]The library's collection has expanded?
[98:13.63]A lot of worms today.
[98:14.55]Ah, open.
[98:23.13]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[98:23.85]I thought it was this.
[98:33.00]This is a book by Marnie.
[98:37.54]Animals are very...
[98:40.01]on farming.
[98:40.55]Use fertilizer and fruit trees and crops will die as soon as the season ends.
[98:44.13]Some crops are just killing... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[98:46.46]Cool.
[98:48.46]Cool.
[98:48.78]Is that all I can donate to him?
[98:54.34]I believe so.
[99:05.97]I hate how you open an hour later than him.
[99:16.42]Usually the only things you find in trash cans are gifts you've given that they have tated.
[99:19.73]Well, whatever.
[99:21.85]I can just recycle them.
[99:22.87]Get them back.
[99:23.29]I'm okay with that.
[99:36.64]Nine.
[99:38.00]Hello.
[99:41.32]Got a lot for you to go through.
[99:46.90]That's new.
[99:48.88]Boston Cream Donut.
[99:50.15]Alright.
[99:54.01]Five Gold Ore.
[99:55.87]Hockey Puck.
[99:57.61]Okay.
[100:02.34]Frisbee.
[100:04.32]Nice.
[100:09.00]Dolomite.
[100:12.90]Shree.
[100:15.81]Eggplant.
[100:19.22]And a fire quartz.
[100:22.44]Very cool.
[100:22.98]Ooh, what is that?
[100:26.19]Floripatite.
[100:27.99]Floripatite.
[100:30.27]Floripatite.
[100:32.83]Some complicated word.
[100:43.18]I have a feeling I can donate half of these.
[100:50.62]Yeah, I can.
[100:52.02]The Boston Cream Donut is going to go over here.
[100:56.54]The Pool Noodle Tip is going to go over here.
[100:59.31]Obsidian, whatever, is going to go over here.
[101:03.05]And the Frisbee is going to go right here.
[101:06.81]Still no reward.
[101:10.09]Ah!
[101:12.92]Ah!
[101:14.80]No reward still?
[101:15.84]I just gave you like five things.
[101:22.67]Well.
[101:26.40]Who's next on the list?
[101:28.48]Oh, right.
[101:29.84]I need to go check on my clay stockpile.
[101:39.47]Because if I have enough, then I can build the silo.
[101:42.93]Have that just there for the spring.
[101:46.01]It's not a bad idea.
[101:50.40]What does donating to the museum do?
[101:53.09]It tells you more about the item the next time you get one.
[101:56.03]And if you donate certain items, or enough items, you get rewards.
[102:00.53]He gives you things.
[102:13.94]How much clay do I have?
[102:15.00]I need five copper bars.
[102:25.87]clay looking for clay another one over here six where I swear no is it it's in this one right no did I miss it is it right here clay where is it do I only have six are you kidding me
[102:55.56]Alright, it's not organization time.

[103:00.56]Hold on.
[103:00.90]We're gonna have stone here.
[103:11.91]Pick it up like this.
[103:15.08]Can only have a thousand.
[103:16.34]Okay.
[103:25.81]Organization skills are required.
[103:31.87]I want you to go over here.
[103:33.79]What the fuck are you doing?
[103:35.93]What is going on here?
[103:38.47]I want this to be in the top left.
[103:43.06]What is... Ugh.
[103:49.02]Okay.
[103:50.24]Wood.
[103:51.62]What's next?
[103:52.18]Quartz, probably?
[103:55.89]No bars.
[103:56.78]No, fuck it.
[104:01.84]I don't even care anymore.
[104:04.06]Oh, I have these.
[104:04.48]I didn't even know I had these.
[104:16.99]There's the shit.
[104:17.73]It just doesn't even need to be up there.
[104:22.90]Give me the stone, the wood.
[104:26.02]I need copper.
[104:28.98]I can buy that from that asshole.
[104:35.29]And then... So I need clay.
[104:40.17]This is such a fucking mess.
[104:47.65]I know I can just do the organize button, but...
[104:50.88]I don't like the... I want to do it the way I want, you know?
[104:56.23]See, it's like, it puts everything, like, randomly.
[105:01.75]I want to be able to do it the way I want.
[105:08.23]See, it's like putting mushrooms and shit up here.
[105:10.03]Oh, well.
[105:20.99]Uh, time to do some crafting.
[105:30.25]I have a lot of crafting to do.
[105:32.75]Jeez.
[105:33.17]I have so many gold bars I can make.
[105:38.33]This is gonna take a million years.
[105:41.83]How much is it to make?
[105:42.47]I'm gonna make a thousand furnaces or something.
[105:44.35]What do I need for a furnace?
[105:45.33]I don't even have enough to do that.
[105:50.22]Ugh.
[105:56.69]Probably gonna take a while.
[106:03.65]What's on the TV?
[106:12.02]Few inches of snow tomorrow.
[106:13.30]No shit.
[106:14.24]Alright, fortune teller, what do you got?
[106:21.71]Oh!
[106:23.55]Droppin' shit all over the place.
[106:27.26]Alright, while these finish, I'm going to go to the bathroom.
[106:30.90]I'll be right back.
[106:33.47]Everybody, hold your horses.
[106:35.43]I will see you very soon.
[109:18.16]I got a snack, too.
[109:21.68]I got a snack.
[109:23.08]Oh, fuck.
[109:23.68]I didn't pause the game.
[109:27.08]Or did I?
[109:28.26]I don't know.
[109:40.47]Chewy cookies?
[109:41.19]No.
[109:44.63]Slices of cheese and Italian bread.
[109:51.74]That's what I'm eating.
[110:02.72]Oh, I know why I didn't pause.
[110:03.64]Because I was waiting for these things to be done.
[110:11.59]Eating granola in the bathroom again?
[110:13.01]No, that's not a bad idea though.
[110:19.59]Gold bars!
[110:23.63]Do it again.
[110:24.21]Put it in there.
[110:31.78]Get in there.
[110:34.10]Get in there.
[110:42.78]Mm-mm-mm.
[110:47.93]Mm.
[110:54.73]I apologize.
[110:55.37]I'm trying to eat this as fast as I can.
[111:09.96]Why is my dog... It's too cold out.
[111:11.44]Why is my dog outside?
[111:13.68]Shouldn't he be inside?
[111:14.42]I need to break this fence down too.
[111:23.84]It's annoying me.
[111:33.39]Should I give Abby a perfect quartz?
[111:35.91]She likes this, right?
[111:40.27]I should give her an amethyst.
[111:41.17]I'll give her an amethyst.
[112:06.89]Let's go find her.
[112:07.69]Oh, Abigail.
[112:25.78]Abigail, where are you?
[112:28.76]I've got a special treat for you.
[112:31.76]Which house does she live in?
[112:38.19]I have no idea.
[112:40.48]No, this one.
[112:41.30]Pierre.
[112:43.54]Oh, my God.
[112:46.36]I don't want to go into the shop.
[112:47.82]I want to talk to Abigail.
[112:49.14]Hey, I actually have a million of those.
[112:53.24]I have a bunch of red mushrooms.
[112:56.76]Didn't I just pick up a thousand of them?
[113:06.77]Hey, look.
[113:07.19]There's my founder.
[113:10.51]Hey, Abigail, before you go home, I've got an amethyst for you.
[113:14.81]Hey.
[113:17.68]I seriously love this.
[113:19.08]You're the best.
[113:21.52]What?
[113:21.76]Come on, two.
[113:24.40]Two.
[113:26.60]Did you know that my dad loves fried calamari?
[113:28.84]It's his favorite.
[113:35.91]Fine.
[113:39.30]Okay, Gus.
[113:41.72]I've got a special red mushroom vial.
[113:47.28]Hey, so you saw the notice?
[113:48.52]Oh, cool!
[113:49.28]Here's a little something for your treble.
[113:53.14]Thanks.
[113:53.36]I just don't want to catch a squid.
[114:01.45]I've given this guy a lot of stuff.
[114:02.71]I wonder if he likes me yet.
[114:17.71]I would break down what just happened and be angry about it.
[114:22.46]But... I mean... There's nothing to say.
[114:28.08]There's literally nothing to say.
[114:35.93]Absolute junk.
[114:39.85]I just brought one to him and he wanted it so badly.
[114:42.09]And a second one for free?
[114:44.29]I brought him two.
[114:45.05]One for free.
[114:46.84]And it's junk.
[114:49.32]He's offended.
[114:53.08]He hated that, what I just did, so much that he was... Like I said, there's nothing to say.
[114:59.89]I've already said what needs to be said.
[115:02.05]I'm severely disappointed at what just happened.
[115:06.20]Severely.
[115:10.28]Let's go dig through the trash and forget about our troubles.
[115:16.96]Can't even do that.
[115:25.44]I think it's just time for bed.
[115:32.20]Unless... I only have four.
[115:39.51]Is the Adventurer's Guild still open?
[115:40.59]So I can sell some of this crap.
[115:48.77]We'll find out, won't we?
[115:51.42]Can I get there from here?
[115:54.00]Yeah.
[115:54.14]Yeah.
[116:02.16]find the mushroom.
[116:04.36]Yeah, I probably will find the mushroom in there.
[116:09.22]Am I gonna make it before 10?
[116:12.41]What the fuck is that flying?
[116:14.19]Is that a giant bat?
[116:17.15]What was that?
[116:31.65]940!
[116:33.17]Stay open!
[116:37.01]Okay.
[116:48.10]Get rid of this.
[116:49.17]Get rid of this.
[116:49.77]I can get rid of this.
[116:53.61]Thank you for taking my junk.
[117:04.20]Is he still asleep?
[117:05.81]How come I couldn't sell that?
[117:13.19]Could I sell that and just didn't see it?
[117:14.93]Oh, yeah.
[117:16.15]Alright, got rid of that junk.
[117:24.93]Who's in a coma?
[117:30.31]Well, time for bed.
[117:36.59]Pay attention to me?
[117:38.75]Ton?
[117:39.31]Tonkoots?
[117:40.69]What do you want?
[117:41.41]I'm paying attention to you right now.
[117:44.03]You have my full, undivided attention.
[117:47.47]What is it?
[117:48.39]What's up?
[118:01.58]Whoa.
[118:20.15]My butter is ready Do another one Do another set I can do gold tools soon, right?
[118:30.80]Yeah, I can do it now Time to go to sleep Go to bed
[118:47.29]Oh, sorry, I just punched my microphone.
[119:07.64]I really do need more furnaces.
[119:11.17]What is... What is this?
[119:13.53]If...
[119:17.62]50 gold?
[119:17.88]I don't understand.
[119:19.50]Are these just the amount that I've sold?
[119:20.98]Yeah, I think so.
[119:36.41]Yeah, gotta keep those characters... They gotta be chilled.
[119:40.13]The perfect minus 10 degrees.
[119:46.88]Get these Geodudes.
[119:50.12]I can go do that.
[119:53.88]I'm gonna definitely bring my pickaxe so I can finally get rid of that eyesore in my garage.
[120:02.22]That's the plan right now, is to go upgrade the pickaxe.
[120:07.60]So no mine for a couple days, but at least I'll be able to get rid of the thing in my front lawn.
[120:18.82]Pokémon, Pokémon, Pokémon, Pokémon.
[120:23.32]Ah, the French Champagne.
[120:26.59]Probably to celebrate for its excellence.
[120:35.63]Upgrade the dog.
[120:36.99]I'm gonna get my dog five gold bars to give him, like, super senses.
[120:54.44]No, the gold pickaxe can definitely break it.
[120:56.40]I don't know why I wouldn't be able to.
[120:59.25]That would be absurd.
[121:15.63]Meteor.
[121:22.57]Come on, I don't got all day.
[121:29.50]Well, I do have all day.
[121:31.14]It's only 8.40 in the morning.
[121:39.74]Come on!
[121:42.46]No!
[121:43.62]Yes.
[121:49.47]I have, like, another 10, 20 minutes.
[121:51.11]Hail Mary.
[121:53.09]Oh, come on.
[122:02.12]This is a live one?
[122:03.20]Okay.
[122:04.14]Fuck off.
[122:04.54]I don't even care.
[122:07.83]Itching my eye for that one.
[122:08.83]It doesn't count.
[122:11.21]Gold pickaxe.
[122:15.23]Okay.
[122:20.83]Now, I want to make quality sprinklers.
[122:26.52]I have enough to be able to do that.
[122:28.20]I'm kind of running out of coal, though.
[122:32.55]Save the rest of my gold.
[122:42.57]You want to talk?
[122:43.23]Yeah.
[122:48.46]Okay.
[122:49.16]Thanks for telling me something I already knew.
[122:58.38]Damn it.
[122:58.66]I didn't have anything in the trash cans.
[123:02.67]Hey, Jerm Jerm.
[123:04.83]Hey, Kaffa.
[123:06.07]Or Kaffa.
[123:16.01]Yeah, I was going to do the Geodudes too, but I got sidetracked because I wanted to do the Gold Bars.
[123:27.28]Because I want to make quality sprinklers.
[123:31.14]A bunch of them.
[123:32.90]So I don't ever have to water my plants again.
[123:36.77]Is that done?
[123:38.13]What?
[123:38.77]Are you kidding me?
[123:42.73]Okay, quality sprinkler.
[123:43.93]24 adjacent tiles.
[123:50.64]Wow.
[123:53.14]I have a battery pack, too.
[123:57.57]So this is the best of the best, huh?
[124:10.18]But I'm going to do the most of these.
[124:15.70]Bunch of refined quartz, bunch of iron bar.
[124:17.24]It's just going to take a while.
[124:19.96]It's just going to take a while.
[124:21.34]I might go buy a bunch of copper.
[124:32.25]So I can just make a ton of furnaces.
[124:40.52]What else can I even do here?
[124:41.62]I can make seed maker, loom.
[124:43.92]Where's the mayonnaise machine?
[124:47.08]Mayonnaise.
[124:49.18]Earth crystals.
[124:57.70]Staircase.
[125:02.44]bombs can this hurry the hell up can you make a better furnace eventually can you upgrade the furnace or something so it doesn't take a million years well I guess oh there we go finally
[125:33.03]and while that cooks I'm going to start very very slowly
[126:07.86]It's gonna get some pathing.
[126:10.36]I'm gonna plan what's gonna happen out here.
[126:17.91]Okay.
[126:19.45]So, the idea is I'm gonna have... No, I don't want those there.
[126:27.03]Fuck, I can't even pick them up now.
[126:28.82]I will later.
[126:29.24]I need my pickaxe.
[126:46.34]Oh, it makes little walking sounds.
[126:47.66]Well, I'll have to wait.
[127:00.73]What can I do in the meantime?
[127:01.77]Just keep crafting the ore down, really.
[127:09.57]Okay, go to the mine.
[127:10.29]Yeah, I'm gonna go to the mine and get some more copper.
[127:14.05]Sounds easy enough just to farm it from the first, like, 20 areas.
[127:30.61]Favorite pizza topping?
[127:32.73]That's a tough one.
[127:36.23]Uh... It depends on the day, it really does.
[127:43.24]fuck I don't have a pickaxe can I just go to sleep right here pain in the ass hold on can't I deck and dig though right with my hoe can I go in there and like dig for clay that's what I need
[128:15.19]But if you're talking about pizza toppings, barbecue chicken and caramelized onions is like, damn, that's fucking good.
[128:27.41]Besides that, I'm not really like a pepperoni fan, really.
[128:33.40]I don't hate it, but I don't really like love it, you know.
[128:40.54]I can't dig some shit out of the ground.
[128:43.97]I'm supposed to be glowing.
[128:45.17]Why am I not glowing?
[128:58.27]You don't have a pickaxe in the wintertime?
[128:59.61]Like, what are you supposed to do?
[129:00.57]There's not much you can really do.
[129:15.69]Just gonna look for worms.
[129:16.57]I'm going on a worm hunt.
[129:33.18]Well, that's a donating thing.
[129:40.88]Worms down here.
[129:48.55]Other than that, uh, it's a good topping.
[129:52.73]I'm not a big fan of meat pizza.
[129:54.59]And by meat I mean, I don't like, um, like hamburger meat on my pizza.
[129:58.94]It weighs it down too much.
[130:01.00]And it causes it to collapse on itself.
[130:03.92]Making for a not so great of an experience when you're trying to eat it.
[130:11.58]Crunchy pizza crust.
[130:14.74]All the way.
[130:20.27]For sure.
[130:25.27]Come on, worms.
[130:28.55]Pineapple?
[130:28.99]I never was a pineapple fan either.
[130:32.21]They sell like Hawaiian pizza, right?
[130:33.42]Which is pineapple and ham.
[130:34.44]I'm not a big fan.
[130:37.50]I don't like mixing sweet and savory all that often.
[130:43.74]I like to separate those two things.
[130:49.94]What are my thoughts on Garfield?
[130:50.98]Like, Garfield the cat?
[130:53.77]Jim Davis presents Garfield?
[130:55.13]Uh... I don't really have an opinion.
[131:00.11]He's a comic book character.
[131:06.83]Damn it.
[131:11.82]Did I miss more?
[131:12.42]Did I?
[131:20.71]Well, I'm getting a lot of cool things to donate.
[131:37.46]Where was it?
[131:37.92]Over here?
[131:47.37]Not up there.
[131:53.28]I used to love stuffed crust pizza.
[131:56.58]Now that was super, super... Something about the cheese in the middle.
[132:00.06]It was crazy.
[132:00.98]I loved it.
[132:01.36]I don't even know what kind of cheese it was.
[132:02.82]It was like fake cheese.
[132:07.41]But it tasted incredible.
[132:11.45]Another book.
[132:22.44]Just another day digging for worms.
[132:29.80]You got any worms near your house?
[132:41.17]Worms.
[132:44.49]Oh, worms.
[132:47.13]Yeah, go to the beach.
[132:49.75]That's not a bad idea.
[132:53.02]Now that is not a bad idea.
[133:03.39]The worms on the beach will be giving, like, clams and stuff, won't they?
[133:05.83]Look at all these worms.
[133:16.61]Ooh, snow yam.
[133:20.59]Just food, I guess?
[133:25.84]I don't want to punch my microphone.
[133:28.72]It would cause ear problems.
[133:30.76]There we go, clay.
[133:32.50]Wonderful.
[133:38.32]What is this?
[133:40.24]Strange doll.
[133:41.32]Look at this little freak.
[133:59.55]Get this bug meat.
[134:05.05]Sea urchin.
[134:12.08]These things, I don't want these things.
[134:13.30]I want to pick up the... Give me some coral.
[134:19.98]Could use it.
[134:26.14]Can I do this...
[134:28.87]So we're going to use it on something.
[134:31.14]Pretty sure I can.
[134:31.84]Don't call it a freak.
[134:36.24]That's mean.
[134:36.68]Well, they're little corals.
[134:40.89]Little carols.
[134:41.51]I think that's it for worms here.
[134:50.73]Time to go home.
[135:04.86]Why is the chat, like the media, asking a person a ton of questions after his speech?
[135:09.35]Like, oh yeah, you in the back?
[135:10.57]Yeah.
[135:12.05]I love pepperoni on my pizza.
[135:13.73]Absolutely.
[135:14.79]You over there?
[135:15.23]Yep.
[135:15.61]Okay.
[135:22.57]I can't open the trash can.
[135:37.57]I could cut down some trees too.
[135:44.38]That is a possibility.
[135:45.66]I could do that.
[135:53.42]That is what we will do.
[135:54.52]Yes.
[135:54.60]But first I need some more quartz.
[136:03.86]Sell this shit.
[136:11.62]Fuck.
[136:13.10]I need another case.
[136:25.29]Three of these things now.
[136:26.93]Great.
[136:27.25]I'm going to sell this.
[136:44.31]13 gold.
[136:50.57]Clay.
[136:51.17]I got a lot of things to donate here.
[136:54.74]Let's make some more of this.
[137:00.66]Iron.
[137:04.57]And then go to bed.
[137:17.63]Day number 12 was halfway there.
[137:19.51]Now I should be able to make a quality sprinkler now, right?
[137:31.37]Yes, I can make a couple.
[137:34.85]Eight adjacent tiles.
[137:36.33]That means I can make a little spot in the middle and then surround it, right?
[137:44.30]That'll water more.
[137:45.14]Okay, I gotta plan that out.
[137:49.43]In the meantime give me the rest of those quartz My pickaxe done Playing video games past my bedtime.
[138:11.74]No, I just turned the stream on for a little bit I don't know how long I'm gonna be screaming for
[138:20.25]Who knows?
[138:22.07]But let's make some sprinklers.
[138:33.38]I need a couple more of these.
[138:34.46]I've got four on the way.
[138:41.56]I'm researching the forgotten art of shadow divination.
[138:45.37]I require an item known as the Void Essence.
[138:47.01]Bring it to me and you will be rewarded.
[138:49.31]That's the monster shit, isn't it?
[138:52.39]Don't I already have that?
[138:55.75]Or did I sell them all?
[138:56.63]I probably sold all of them.
[139:13.38]Okey-dokey.
[139:17.63]What's Otto up to?
[139:18.37]He's sleeping right over here.
[139:20.51]He's lying down over that way.
[139:22.25]Over that way.
[139:34.49]Eight clay.
[139:35.07]I need two more clay.
[139:39.37]Do I already have it?
[139:44.03]Nope.
[139:44.57]Two more clay.
[139:49.65]Outer Wilds?
[139:50.29]What's Outer Wilds?
[139:53.43]Is that some type of super fun game?
[139:59.01]Donate some stuff.

[140:35.96]There you are.
[140:36.40]Do I have enough copper bars?
[140:40.34]I highly don't think so.
[140:41.70]Highly doubt it.
[140:43.68]Yeah.
[140:44.58]Shit.
[141:04.13]Gonna get a wife by year five.
[141:07.54]As long as I can enjoy myself through a year or two of the game, then I'm good to go.

[143:25.11]Oh, well.
[143:28.13]That's, uh... That sounds like a pretty morbid game.
[143:34.68]Sounds kind of morbid.
[143:38.20]Let's cut some trees down.
[143:43.02]Since I still can't go back to the mine.
[143:47.10]We'll cut down some trees.
[143:53.19]All the while, we will make more refined quartz.
[144:09.22]Copper axe.
[144:12.48]Okay.
[144:26.53]Oink.
[144:27.75]I have a lot of sap too, so I can make a fertilizer for the spring.
[144:31.24]Stupid maple seeds.
[144:40.41]You are useless to me right now.
[144:54.78]You want me to say burp brumple?
[144:58.69]That is that important?
[145:01.99]Burp, burple, brumple?
[145:09.46]Well, I said it.
[145:14.42]Thanks a lot, redhead.
[145:16.71]Redhead-o-rama.
[145:24.89]Please burp.
[145:31.87]It happened.
[145:32.55]What did I just say?
[145:33.77]I said, like, burple or something.
[145:38.31]Purple, purple.
[145:41.63]Look, I'm trying to take care of my farm.
[145:44.99]Sorry if I'm mispronouncing your made-up word.
[145:54.39]Alright, I'm gonna burp my fuckin' ABCs if this keeps up.
[145:58.61]Just like, just like a fuckin', like, 12-year-old at the, uh, cafeteria table.
[146:05.25]If this keeps up, I swear to God.
[146:17.50]Uh, that name is a little, uh, Jerma's boyfriend is your name.
[146:28.70]Some of these names.
[146:33.20]Yeah, made up words are important.
[146:35.00]They are important.
[146:37.82]Can't agree on that.
[146:53.47]Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.
[146:56.05]Now we're all screwed.
[146:57.77]He's coming.
[147:15.44]It's showtime.
[147:18.92]Oh, I'm exhausted.
[147:20.08]Don't worry, I can eat this little fucking tart.
[147:23.22]Okay, what do you want to do?
[147:28.51]Look, hear me out here.
[147:29.45]Hear me out.
[147:31.99]Get out of here.
[147:33.23]This is my fucking name.
[147:36.65]Peter just sounds like he's constantly burping.
[147:40.27]He's always, like, holding down a burp.
[147:43.79]That's the Beetlejuice voice.
[147:46.84]Hold the burp down.
[147:48.36]Sound kind of like this.
[147:49.32]It hurts a little bit, but, you know, come on.
[147:54.40]Back to bed.
[148:01.21]Holy shit.
[148:04.29]What was so much money?
[148:06.35]These.
[148:08.19]Damn.
[148:16.82]That's a lot of money.
[148:29.35]Where are we at?
[148:29.97]Are we at... Can I please get my pickaxe back?
[148:40.15]So I can continue... Remove this fence and get started.
[148:57.94]Sick house.
[148:58.44]You like it?
[148:59.26]Thanks, man.
[149:01.54]I tried.
[149:07.34]Plant a pickaxe tree?
[149:09.94]Yeah, I'm gonna plant a gold pickaxe tree.
[149:13.64]You bury ten gold bars, cover it with clay and fertilizer, and in two seasons you get a gold pickaxe tree.
[149:26.28]Well, have a nice night, dude.
[149:28.62]Thanks for coming out.
[149:30.76]Oh, your name is very bright, so I can't even see what your name is.
[149:34.34]Is it... Fib?
[149:36.96]Looks like Fib.
[149:39.26]Have a nice night.
[149:40.22]Good sleep.
[149:53.69]Good morning.
[149:55.98]I forget.
[149:56.40]Sometimes I do forget that.
[149:58.04]Because right now it's like 3 o'clock in the morning here.
[150:02.38]It's like 8 a.m.
[150:04.56]in Europe.
[150:06.26]So if you're watching from Europe, good morning.
[150:09.24]Hope you're having a good morning.
[150:20.68]I do not have better Twitch to be.
[150:22.00]Yeah, I know.
[150:22.55]What about an iPad casual?
[150:33.19]One more long range.
[150:36.25]It's almost midnight in Vancouver in the west coast.
[150:44.86]It always interests me is where people watch from.
[150:56.57]Oh, that's right.
[150:58.85]What time is it for real?
[151:00.05]Daylight savings time happened.
[151:01.17]What time is it right now for real?
[151:02.97]Oh, for East Coast.
[151:03.95]Is it 2?
[151:04.37]3?
[151:05.05]Because we went forward, didn't we?
[151:09.27]Oh, shit.
[151:10.13]We are going forward.
[151:12.23]So it's like 4 o'clock in the morning.
[151:14.74]Oh, fuck.
[151:19.24]That sucks.
[151:21.68]Oh, no.
[151:22.50]It really is like 3.35, isn't it?
[151:26.87]Ugh.
[151:28.79]Is it really 4 AM right now?
[151:30.37]Am I up at 4 AM again?
[151:34.34]That is disastrous news.
[151:43.78]Okay, let's get these processed.
[151:47.42]Blueberry pie.
[151:48.36]We already have one of those, but I'll take another one.
[151:52.80]Shit.
[151:54.94]Shit.
[151:58.34]That's okay.
[152:00.72]Shit.
[152:05.94]No, three isn't much better, but three isn't four.
[152:09.62]That's a big cutoff.
[152:11.96]If you go to bed at 4 a.m., it's like your whole world's out of whack.
[152:16.56]You go to bed at 3 a.m., you're still okay.
[152:20.99]4 a.m.
[152:21.49]is you're getting close to the sun being up.
[152:23.89]Four to five?
[152:24.79]Alright.
[152:29.77]Staying up all night.
[152:31.05]You heard it here.
[152:32.63]We're going into Sunday, guys.
[152:35.53]That's how late we're going to be streaming this game.
[152:39.11]You wanted a long stream?
[152:40.37]You wanted like a fucking Sunday morning stream?
[152:43.43]You got it.
[152:50.21]Fuck, why did I just say that?
[152:51.77]Now I have to do it.
[153:00.75]Can I sell this?
[153:01.37]I don't know how to feel about this.
[153:10.09]Yeah, Ernest, I don't know.
[153:11.95]It's a tough call.
[153:18.97]Well, now I can at least... You guys ready?
[153:23.82]Moment of truth.
[153:24.72]Let's see what's inside of that fucking giant jawbreaker that's in my front lawn.
[153:39.75]Do a non-stop stream to my nexbrit.
[153:42.29]Why am I putting R's in these words?
[153:46.77]I'm just adding R's in every sentence.
[153:49.20]Every syllable.
[153:56.04]As long as my back doesn't start hurting a lot.
[153:58.36]It still hurts, but as long as it doesn't unbearably hurt me.
[154:01.40]I'm okay with streaming for a while.
[154:03.77]Okay, here we go.
[154:09.26]Oh, it can do it.
[154:09.84]It can do it.
[154:10.20]It can do it.
[154:10.50]It can do it.
[154:10.76]Here we go.
[154:13.92]What's in it?
[154:15.62]Oh!
[154:19.44]Six... Where is it?
[154:23.58]Six iridium ore.
[154:26.07]Two GU dudes.
[154:28.81]That's finally out of my fucking lawn.
[154:32.09]Oh, I'm so happy to see that gone.
[154:36.63]Get rid of this.
[154:37.05]I don't want this shit anymore.
[154:39.98]I'd rather shit in my pants than look at this again.
[154:47.68]I'd rather wear a diaper and shit in the diaper and not change the diaper for three days than look at this fence.
[155:06.25]It's gone.
[155:07.87]It's gone.
[155:08.33]It kind of feels empty, doesn't it?
[155:11.19]Yeah, I miss it.
[155:12.87]I miss it.
[155:13.35]It was right here.
[155:16.89]It's been here since the first 10 minutes of this game.
[155:22.09]I don't like it.
[155:23.54]I need something there.
[155:24.30]He kills my brother.
[155:41.84]I did.
[155:50.05]Put it back.
[155:51.51]Put the meteor back.
[155:52.59]Ah, this is getting lost.
[155:55.07]No, it didn't get lost.
[155:59.45]That's good.
[156:00.09]Chain!
[156:03.66]Yeah, I can make a meteor monument.
[156:06.04]Yeah, I'll do that.
[156:06.58]Here.
[156:07.06]Don't worry.
[156:07.40]Watch, watch, watch.
[156:09.50]I already have the perfect idea.
[156:13.95]Perfect plan.
[156:20.02]This stupid fucking thing is coming with me.
[156:27.66]Here we go.
[156:35.11]I can't put this down here?
[156:37.07]Why?
[156:41.71]Why can I not put this here?
[156:44.38]Bullshit.
[156:45.66]Can I put the bear out there?
[156:46.54]That's dumb.
[156:54.93]I mean, can I put the crystal out there and I could get some fun little melodies every now and then?
[157:01.22]That can remind us of the cool crystal thing that was there.
[157:09.00]Yeah, see?
[157:09.40]Okay.
[157:12.41]See, this is singing the song of the old meteor.
[157:23.71]How funny would it be if another one just landed right on top of me right now?
[157:33.36]Perfect.
[157:34.28]Yeah.
[157:37.08]Now let's get our farm ready, guys.
[157:42.65]I need to make some more sprinkles.
[157:46.01]Where are my gold bars?
[157:50.63]Why did I do that?
[157:51.23]Now it's just a mess.
[158:04.21]Gold bars?
[158:04.99]I hate this.
[158:05.53]You know what?
[158:07.41]Community center.
[158:08.67]I'm filling my inventory.
[158:11.02]With stuff.
[158:12.61]So I can go to the community.
[158:13.55]I have so much fucking trash.
[158:21.94]Don't know what to do with all this stuff.
[158:23.28]I need like I need a business manager to manage my inventory Alright, who wants to be my fucking business manager for this game you all you have to do is I'm gonna give you my account and you log in and Organize my backpacks then get rid of the stuff.
[158:40.98]I don't need I

[158:49.00]It hurts.
[158:50.02]I don't know what is what and what's where and where is why and why is who and who is what.

[159:14.09]We have 15 days to spring, but spring cleaning time.
[159:18.72]I don't care about any of this shit.
[159:21.79]All the stuff that's just kind of garbage is going into the garbage.
[159:28.85]Not far so good.
[159:43.06]Clay, I can go and get the rest of the... Get the silo built.

[159:56.23]I need copper bars.
[160:05.05]No, give me that back.
[160:10.67]Goddamn.

[160:23.07]Winter cleaning?
[160:23.61]Yeah, it is winter cleaning.
[160:27.13]The moon, the bear, and the big blue house waiting to come and play.
[160:56.76]Okay.
[160:59.38]What else?
[161:00.66]Oh, purple mushroom.
[161:03.26]Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet.
[161:09.19]And a red mushroom.
[161:10.59]I'm gonna go to the community center.
[161:12.15]See if I can donate some stuff.
[161:14.59]Get this dumb rare crow out of here.
[161:15.97]I don't like it.
[161:16.57]I hate it.
[161:23.28]Enough for one iridium sprinkler.
[161:24.98]Yeah, that's true.
[161:27.17]That is true.
[161:27.65]This is 24 adjacent tiles.
[161:30.87]That's insane.
[161:33.95]God, that's getting... Is it hot in here?
[161:36.67]I'm getting a little flustered at that sprinkler.
[161:41.61]Hello, dog.
[161:45.71]Community center.
[161:53.65]Right, first we gotta check on the booger farm.
[161:59.98]I can't even pick them up.
[162:00.60]I don't have any room.
[162:13.11]Much more of this stuff.
[162:15.69]I can't pick it up.
[162:26.70]What was the community center?
[162:27.70]I forget already.
[162:37.71]Wait, what?
[162:38.09]This is not right.
[162:42.07]This is not right.
[162:44.83]This is not correct.
[162:47.24]I haven't been to the community center for like 12 hours.
[162:50.22]I don't remember where the hell it is.
[162:52.04]Isn't it down here?
[163:01.16]There it is.
[163:09.10]Oh, itchy eyes.
[163:10.96]Itchy eyes are the worst eyes.
[163:17.32]What do we have here?
[163:23.50]Crabs.
[163:26.50]Fish.
[163:26.80]I think these are all fish, right?
[163:28.56]Yeah.
[163:30.83]I'm not doing that right now.
[163:39.62]Summer crops.
[163:41.56]No, that's summer.
[163:43.84]Fall animal bundle.
[163:45.60]Artisan bundle.
[163:48.14]What the fuck is all that crap?
[163:50.52]Quality crops.
[163:54.08]Spring crops.
[163:55.35]Animal bundle.
[163:56.07]Fall crops.
[163:56.83]Artisan bundle.
[163:57.53]Summer crops.
[163:58.21]Well, I don't have any of those.
[163:59.63]Where's winter?
[164:00.01]Winter.
[164:04.58]Winter foraging.
[164:05.40]Okay.
[164:07.18]I just sold one of these.
[164:22.07]Winter foraging.
[164:22.91]So I need a yam and one of these.
[164:27.21]And I already got rid of it.
[164:35.69]I can give one of these.
[164:39.67]Cave carrot.
[164:42.64]I already have one in there.
[164:45.76]Funny looking shroom.
[164:46.70]What is that?
[164:49.76]It's like a cheese bread.
[164:53.94]Can you give more than... No.
[164:54.64]Okay.
[164:59.94]Okay.
[165:06.13]Oh, okay.
[165:06.63]Fine.
[165:06.87]Yeah.
[165:07.45]I'll do this.
[165:09.99]You want 99?
[165:12.51]Sure.
[165:13.27]Take it.
[165:13.53]I got plenty.
[165:20.45]I only have... I didn't take any driftwood.
[165:22.50]I didn't know I needed it.
[165:24.48]No.
[165:28.70]Exotic foraging.
[165:31.22]Winter foraging.
[165:32.08]Alright.
[165:34.60]Okay.
[165:37.22]Anything else?
[165:40.36]It's not spring.
[165:44.49]Fall.
[165:45.27]Actually, I think I still... I have this stuff.
[165:49.33]Yeah, I do.
[165:51.37]And a mushroom.
[165:52.57]Bingo!
[165:58.05]What do I get?
[165:59.79]Give me my... fall seeds.
[166:06.11]Eh.
[166:07.53]It's not.
[166:08.47]Eh.
[166:09.95]Eh.
[166:13.81]Maple syrup, cactus fruit, pine tar.
[166:19.33]Where the hell are you?
[166:29.03]Opening up a new area?
[166:30.91]Sure thing.
[166:31.27]I'll check it out.
[166:37.71]Hey, cute little guy.
[166:50.46]Geologists bundle.
[166:53.94]Don't have that at the moment.
[166:54.88]Okay, remind me to hold on to these things.
[167:06.49]Okay, I can come back here and just bang these all out.
[167:09.82]Except for this one, because I need an Earth crystal.
[167:13.04]I only have one of these.
[167:13.78]Okay, I'm going to have to come back with all these things I need.
[167:27.61]What a community center.
[167:29.11]It looks so nice.
[167:43.75]So what happens if I eat one of these right now?
[167:46.21]Is it going to kill me?
[167:56.56]Back to bed and then we're going into the caves.
[168:00.28]I need copper.
[168:02.32]I might just buy it all.
[168:04.96]Yeah.
[168:06.74]Yeah, I'm just going to buy it all.
[168:14.42]I'm purchasing copper ore.
[168:15.64]I don't care.
[168:19.34]What are my thoughts on hot wings?
[168:31.47]I actually don't really like chicken wings.
[168:36.58]I like chicken tenders.
[168:38.22]So if you're talking about like buffalo wings or like hot wings, I'd much rather it be boneless than to have like an actual bony wing that you bite into and around the bone and everything.
[168:50.25]I prefer tenders, but I like them a lot.
[168:54.39]Buffalo is like one of my favorite things to put on chicken.
[168:58.05]Hot sauce, buffalo sauce.
[169:00.47]Shit is wild.
[169:01.23]Alright, well, I'll figure this out.
[169:05.47]No, I'm going to...
[169:08.28]I need hardwood.
[169:08.94]Yeah, I'll do that tomorrow.
[169:12.77]I'll do it tomorrow.
[169:13.51]Who gives a flying fuck?
[169:22.19]What I think is I haven't really lost any money.
[169:25.05]I've spent a lot of money.
[169:32.56]Okay.
[169:36.28]Gold bar, battery pack.
[169:37.28]Where's my gold bar?
[169:39.90]There's a battery pack.
[169:47.51]Where's the battery pack?
[169:51.49]Am I crazy?
[169:52.75]Where the fuck is it?
[169:55.11]There it is.
[169:57.65]Alright, we can make a super sprinkler.
[170:02.19]24 adjacent tiles.
[170:04.37]No more fucking around next year.
[170:14.53]Okay, I can get rid of the hazelnuts.
[170:22.18]Yeah, all the hazelnuts are gonna go.
[170:25.74]Blackberries are gonna go.
[170:27.26]I already did this.
[170:28.04]Plums are gonna get going.

[176:53.00]I didn't... I fucking lost!
[176:54.72]God, I'm so pissed off right now.
[176:57.62]Because that probably was like a huge shark or something.
[176:59.52]It was so erratic.
[177:08.69]Oh, you green ouchie.
[177:10.51]God.
[177:16.86]That was a catfish.
[177:17.52]I've caught catfishes before and they weren't that tough to reel in.
[177:31.17]Alright, let's go.

[177:46.40]Nice.

[177:53.61]Thanks.
[177:54.81]I'll put that to good use.
[177:56.81]Okay, I need... How much do I need?
[178:01.11]I need... It's five per, right?
[178:03.01]So one, two, three, four.
[178:09.53]That should do it, right?
[178:10.15]That'll make ten.
[178:10.71]I have enough of that.
[178:17.24]Yeah, because I have four and I need ten.
[178:19.71]So that's five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty, thirty, yeah.
[178:23.15]Good day.
[178:23.65]Wait.
[178:25.43]Wait.
[178:28.05]Ooh, look at that.
[178:30.09]Gold watering can?
[178:35.72]I could do a steel axe.
[178:37.02]I didn't bring the required.
[178:38.34]I could do gold watering can.
[178:44.68]Gold watering can?
[178:45.47]What do you think?
[178:49.42]I have six gold bars.
[178:50.82]Do I need gold bars for anything right now?
[178:54.52]Quality sprinklers.
[178:56.08]Do I really need more than like eight quality sprinklers?
[179:09.97]Done deal.
[179:17.37]Done deal.
[179:20.10]And I still have enough money to get the silo.
[179:24.60]So we're going to go back and make another bar.
[179:40.03]So that was going to be like eight layers.
[179:43.91]Trident layers.
[179:48.94]I like the watering can.
[179:50.88]I want an iridium water can.
[179:52.41]Alright, we gotta pay our respects.
[180:01.65]Okay.
[180:11.92]Let us make... some bread.
[180:17.43]Because then I can upgrade the hoe, right?
[180:22.49]Because I don't even have a copper hoe.
[180:28.44]In the meantime, make sure I have everything.
[180:31.56]400, 900.
[180:32.50]And then the bars and the clay.
[180:46.93]Make some sashimi.
[180:52.23]Fried egg.
[180:52.91]I can make fried eggs.
[180:57.17]Oh, look, a fucking cheeseburger.
[181:00.63]That's not a cheeseburger.
[181:04.80]Bread, carrot, and eggplant.
[181:08.52]That's not a burger.
[181:10.10]That's like a carrot burger.
[181:12.06]That's a carrot in between two pieces of bread.
[181:32.38]Eggplant burger from the Scooby Doo movie?
[181:36.32]Sounds odd.
[181:42.12]Let's upgrade our farm for the first time in a year.
[181:48.64]Let's talk to the construction lady.
[181:51.84]Hey, there's construction lady's house.
[181:54.26]I can go, it's quicker to go this way.
[181:59.48]Pay my respects real quick.
[182:06.37]Hi, dog.
[182:17.13]You can grow people on your farm?
[182:18.65]I don't think so.
[182:21.54]I'm fairly certain you can't grow humans.
[182:25.85]Where's my hoe?
[182:30.43]Out of the book!
[182:39.73]Can't walk away from that.
[182:40.65]Okay... There's the carpenter.
[182:50.27]There's the carpenter.
[182:51.57]Get me over there.
[182:54.53]Excuse me, carpenter.
[182:56.73]Yeah, I gotta ask you.
[182:58.03]Could you make me a fucking farm building?
[183:03.12]Yeah, I need you to make me a fucking silo.
[183:04.96]Yeah, kid.
[183:05.50]Thanks, dude.
[183:07.84]You're a carpenter.
[183:08.60]You can fuck.
[183:09.40]I didn't need any.
[183:10.28]I didn't even need barely any of this shit.
[183:14.34]Thanks a lot, kid.
[183:14.98]Make me a fucking carpenter.
[183:19.47]Should I put it
[183:25.51]Here.
[183:25.75]These are the type of game time decisions I don't like to make.
[183:33.73]It would make sense, like, right here, right?
[183:38.03]I'm gonna say right here.
[183:41.73]Look at the dog.
[183:47.50]Can I go over here?
[183:48.20]No, I can't.
[183:54.56]I like it right here.
[183:58.15]There's a lot of places it could go.
[184:07.57]Fuck, I don't wanna- I don't know.
[184:08.89]I have no idea.
[184:11.49]It's going right here.
[184:12.84]So it'll look cool.
[184:18.36]Back here then.
[184:19.90]Yeah, like right here.
[184:21.38]It'll give the dog a nice shadow.
[184:27.35]Yeah, it's gonna go right here.
[184:31.73]Done deal.
[184:42.16]And we're getting a window.
[184:43.16]We're getting two windows.
[184:43.88]Nope, no TV.
[185:00.52]Okie dokie.

[185:20.97]Linus!
[185:24.67]You're down to level 100, Linus!
[185:29.34]You're gonna go fishing in the lava well, Linus?
[185:34.36]No!
[185:40.85]Too many bait in my inventory, I don't think so.
[185:48.61]No.
[185:53.13]No, I said, El Dio de Diablo de Odio de los Muertos.
[185:56.91]El Dio de Diablo de Odio de los Muertos.
[186:18.19]Catching a fish here is extremely low.
[186:20.91]We're gonna get one.
[186:23.21]With no bait.
[186:26.91]And I have a recycling machine.
[186:30.84]I have a recycling machine.
[186:35.48]No, I'm... I'll go real slow.
[186:39.24]El Dio de Diablo de Odio de los Muertos.

[187:43.76]I'm gonna get it.
[187:44.82]I'm going to get this fish.
[187:47.32]Maximum.
[187:48.34]Did you see that?
[187:51.53]Delete the save and start over.
[187:52.71]Fuck.
[187:53.61]Fuck.
[187:55.17]Fuck.
[187:56.85]What is your fitness stream?
[188:02.62]I can't stream that on Twitch.
[188:05.90]I'll get permanently banned from the site.
[188:08.10]Permanently.
[188:17.49]Yeah, I can get the new rod.
[188:18.63]Don't you have to have a certain fishing level to get a new rod?
[188:24.27]The day of the devil is the day of the dead.
[188:26.15]I actually think it's... The day of the devil of the day of the dead, right?
[188:32.31]El día de diablo de odio de los muertos.
[188:34.87]That's the day of diablo of the day of the dead.
[188:44.14]Let's label it creative.
[188:45.22]I don't know if that'll fly.
[188:59.66]Alright, I'm gonna give this five more attempts, and then we're moving on.
[189:08.57]Day of the dump.
[189:13.69]The day of the devil of the day of the dead.
[189:23.29]You can call it creative because you'd be creating massive gains.
[189:32.21]Alright.
[189:33.39]Three more times.
[189:33.97]At least I'm getting lots of sotis.
[189:47.40]You know the one thing I can say that's good about this?
[189:49.98]Getting plenty of sotis.
[189:57.21]Two more times.
[190:07.11]Two more times.
[190:07.73]Come on.
[190:10.00]Oh, come on.
[190:10.50]I don't want any more SOTYs.
[190:11.50]I want a fucking... I want a monkfish, whatever they are.
[190:20.34]Yeah, you gotta love those SOTYs.
[190:21.56]Otto, what are you doing?
[190:25.91]Speaking of SOTYs, what's this little SOTY dog doing?
[190:28.21]Alright, five more times.
[190:32.59]Yeah, correct.
[190:35.57]Eight more times.
[190:41.30]I want to go until I get another hit.
[190:45.42]If you don't get a hit, then I don't want to do it anymore.
[190:49.28]But I do want to do it, so... Fuck it, driftwood.
[190:52.88]God damn it.
[190:57.02]How can there be this much trash in this lava pit?
[191:00.18]Who's been down here?
[191:02.76]To throw just absolute garbage into this little lake.
[191:06.74]We're talking about being down 100 meters into the Earth's crust.
[191:11.90]And there's broken glasses in here.
[191:16.22]That's bullshit.
[191:18.46]The only thing that's in here are fucking monkfish.
[191:20.98]And I want to catch one.
[191:23.82]Like, whose shitty mixtape is down here?
[191:26.49]We're in the center of the Earth.
[191:44.92]I have so much trash.
[191:47.20]Well, it's too late now to go any further.
[191:49.03]It's 10pm.
[191:50.51]I can't believe I had one.
[191:53.17]I had one too.
[191:58.47]It's too bad.
[192:04.39]That was really hard though.
[192:05.65]If I get another one.
[192:09.80]11 o'clock is the cutoff.
[192:12.28]I actually caught something and I just couldn't reel it in.
[192:25.86]Last attempt.
[192:32.74]Last attempt right here.
[192:45.15]Come on.
[192:47.48]I jumped a gun.
[192:51.66]Last one.
[192:54.62]I have to leave after this one.
[192:55.68]It's going to be like midnight.
[193:01.19]If I can get one reeled up here.
[193:02.29]No, it's not midnight yet.
[193:02.95]It's okay.
[193:05.54]Okay, I definitely have to leave after this one.
[193:07.06]Definitely.
[193:08.50]After this one.
[193:08.90]That was really quick.
[193:29.40]This is a true last one.
[193:30.24]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on Grandpa's fuckin' eighth pair of glasses.
[193:42.20]Great.
[193:49.19]It's okay, I have a dump- I have a bunch of trash, guys.
[193:51.03]Anything in this bush?
[194:03.48]I'm fine.
[194:04.18]As long as you get back before like 1.15, 1.20, 1.40.
[194:06.28]I'm fine.
[194:13.21]Everything's fine.
[194:14.11]Everything's fine.
[194:14.93]Don't worry.
[194:15.33]Everything's going to be fine.
[194:16.03]I'm going to get back.
[194:17.21]I'm going to kick my feet up.
[194:19.93]I'm going to lie in my new chair that I bought.
[194:21.43]I'm going to pay respects.
[194:33.68]Wait a second!
[194:38.98]Yes!
[194:43.02]Good night, dog.
[194:47.20]Good night, bear.
[194:50.28]Go to bed!
[194:52.34]Jeez!
[194:58.91]And I made 4,400 bucks.
[195:03.31]That's a lot of money.
[195:13.89]Okie dokie.
[195:18.07]What else can I do with this trash?
[195:19.33]I guess I can just keep doing it.
[195:30.68]Does it matter what you put in?
[195:33.35]If I put different items of trash, because I think I got a torch last time in a newspaper.
[195:51.53]Curious.
[195:54.74]I wonder what this thing's going to spit out.
[195:55.96]If it's not something spectacular, this is going all in the trash.
[195:59.14]In fact, I don't even care.
[196:01.22]It's all going in the trash anyways.
[196:02.98]I'm not going to sit here and fill up recycling machines.
[196:06.85]Like, this is taking too long.
[196:08.97]You know what I mean?
[196:11.69]It's just taking way too long.
[196:14.43]Although, I'll keep the soatees.
[196:15.63]Those are important.
[196:16.40]Get rid of these torches.
[196:17.06]I don't want to... I have windows, though.
[196:35.70]What a shitty house.
[196:38.24]Okay, so welcome to the tour of the house.
[196:40.42]These are the windows.
[196:41.28]They're the only windows in the whole house.
[196:43.92]They're alright next to each other, and there's no window in any other room.
[196:47.89]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[196:55.15]Leonx 8.
[196:56.05]Thanks for the resub.

[198:35.32]Yeah.
[198:36.06]Didn't think I could transmute into iron, did you?
[198:38.34]14 equals a million.
[198:47.19]It's fine.
[198:47.97]I got... I got... Look at it.
[198:49.77]Do you guys have one of these?
[198:52.09]You probably all have multiple... Hundreds of these.
[198:54.42]But I just got my first one.
[198:55.90]It's purple.
[198:56.74]I got plenty.
[199:00.10]I got diamonds, too.
[199:03.16]Everything's gonna be fine.
[199:07.80]You need to make mistakes to learn.
[199:13.06]See, look, this is worth $100,000.
[199:15.36]Look at that.
[199:18.65]Petrified slime.
[199:19.43]100 fucking grand.
[199:22.07]Easy.
[199:23.15]Done.
[199:31.61]How's it coming?
[199:36.31]She shakes a lot when she swings.
[199:40.50]It's like when you hit a baseball at the very end of the bat.
[199:43.60]Probably hurts.
[199:44.10]Alright, let's go.
[199:46.76]I've lost my train of thought.
[199:47.68]What the hell are we doing?
[199:50.68]I don't know.
[199:52.10]Okay, this is how much of a moron I am.
[199:53.90]You want to know how much of a moron I really am?
[199:56.63]You know when I hovered over this and I saw it?
[199:58.11]I thought that said boo.
[200:01.37]Like boo!
[200:02.59]Not 800%.
[200:05.62]Rocks are trying to scare me.
[200:06.72]Oh, boo.
[200:11.46]Pulled the ants.
[200:18.92]Two books in a row.
[200:23.80]Watering can might be done, which is good.
[200:41.36]So I just saw somebody say Gweg's farm.
[200:44.96]That is my farm.
[200:46.82]I said I was going to be done with that.
[200:48.42]But apparently I'm not.
[200:51.55]Yeah, we're going to go back to the blood pit.
[200:53.07]I'm going to fish and get more stuff.
[200:55.47]But I do want to get my watering can.
[200:58.11]If it's done, that is.
[201:00.07]Which it might not be.
[201:06.94]Still working on your gold watering can.
[201:08.36]It won't be ready today.
[201:12.31]Where's your friend?
[201:12.89]Oh, no, he's in the Adventurer's Guild.
[201:14.77]Wrong person.
[201:22.48]I mean, I guess I can go... I have my energy such shit right now.
[201:27.18]I could go down to the mine again.
[201:31.64]Yeah, I'm gonna go to the mine.
[201:46.00]Kill some stuff, pick up some more things.
[201:49.69]Get ready, get more ready.
[201:54.87]Where does Greg take a shit?
[201:55.77]In the bathroom.
[201:56.79]I have a bathroom.
[201:58.54]It's a beautiful, pristine, iridium toilet.
[202:09.20]Hey, Grandpa.
[202:09.76]Hi, Grandpa.
[202:20.06]Can I put anything else in a queue?
[202:22.32]Or is she busy until that's done?
[202:24.52]Yeah, she is.
[202:31.92]The dog goes to the bathroom outside.
[202:33.12]Really?
[202:35.38]I mean, come on.
[202:35.84]Let me just drink these drinks.
[202:40.89]Get some energy from them.
[202:48.52]He has an iridium bidet that washes 24 adjacent buttholes.
[203:03.15]Why?
[203:04.92]Why would anyone ever have that?
[203:07.40]Why would you ever have that device?
[203:08.82]Would there ever be a reason for that?
[203:21.49]Look at the broken CDs.
[203:32.85]Nothing but... I would be excited if it was nothing but fish.
[203:35.46]That'd be awesome.
[203:36.08]I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore.
[203:42.26]I'm doing this till 2 p.m.
[203:42.94]and then we're going to go back down to the mine.
[203:44.56]Go to 105.
[203:49.04]When am I going to make more GTA joke vids on uScrub?
[203:51.76]I don't want to feel like playing GTA if I ever feel like playing it again.
[204:13.55]Broken glasses.
[204:16.05]Broken glasses.
[204:19.36]Alright, that was the last one.
[204:21.36]We might do one more for good measure.
[204:23.04]We probably will.
[204:28.92]Okay, the last one.
[204:29.42]This is it.
[204:30.48]Bang.
[204:31.94]Whatever happens, happens, and I'm gone.
[204:41.43]I've never used a bidet.
[204:44.89]Will it work?
[204:46.19]I feel like it'd be weird.
[204:47.15]I'd be really odd.
[204:47.89]I'd like jump up and scream like... If it was like water going over there.
[204:58.84]Wouldn't that be legit?
[204:59.40]I just feel like it'd be odd.
[205:00.84]Really odd.
[205:16.24]You have one?
[205:19.42]Something about cold water going there.
[205:22.74]Is it cold?
[205:23.32]I feel like it's freezing cold.
[205:25.44]It probably isn't that cold.
[205:27.32]I don't know why I'm getting that image in my head.
[205:31.06]You guys are in an awkward spot.
[205:44.82]Is that a new ore?
[205:45.82]Is it ruby?
[205:47.56]It is a ruby.
[205:58.35]Doesn't feel cold.
[205:59.68]Ugh, I don't know.
[206:00.66]I have trouble sitting on my toilet seat.
[206:06.08]I have to... Alright, here's some insight, guys.
[206:08.38]You ready?
[206:10.09]I'd say like 50% of the time I go to the bathroom in my toilet.
[206:14.69]I sit down with my pants on first.
[206:18.15]And sit there for like a full two minutes.
[206:21.14]So the seat is warmer.
[206:23.80]Like if I have a pair of jeans on, I'm just sitting on the toilet with a pair of jeans on.
[206:29.60]Until it gets to a point where I can sit on it.
[206:31.34]And it's like, oh, this is nice and tight.
[206:32.52]This is fine.
[206:32.96]This is room temperature now.
[206:36.10]In case you needed to know that.
[206:45.75]Please.
[206:46.17]That's not crazy.
[206:48.69]That is not crazy.
[206:51.26]That is perfectly normal.
[206:57.92]See, somebody said I do that too.
[206:59.30]There's nothing wrong with that.
[207:03.48]That's not how you poop your pants.
[207:06.02]It's not- Okay.
[207:07.62]You guys act like I sit down with the jeans on, and what, I forget they're there?
[207:12.14]Alright, I'm tired.
[207:13.83]Time to sit down.
[207:14.43]I guess the shit's gonna come out now.
[207:16.65]No, you just sit there.
[207:19.57]You don't- Once a couple minutes goes by, that's when you go, Alright!
[207:24.09]I need to eat this shit.
[207:34.86]Don't knock it till you try it.
[207:36.56]Especially in the wintertime when it's really cold.
[207:39.64]You'd be surprised at just how effective that is.
[207:44.74]And some of you guys are going to do it.
[207:46.22]And tomorrow or the next day, you're going to be like, damn.
[207:50.15]He was right.
[207:50.85]I should be doing this every time.
[208:01.85]Anything else up here?
[208:02.81]I don't think so.
[208:04.93]Don't hit me.
[208:05.89]Don't do that.
[208:09.95]Oh yeah, I gotta keep these monster slimes and stuff for the museum.
[208:15.67]The museum.
[208:19.32]I'm not judging.
[208:20.02]I'm just saying.
[208:22.90]Give it a try.
[208:24.82]It'll be a much more enjoyable experience.
[208:34.32]Way to go down already in a ton of shrooms Shrooms have always been celebrated for their actions There is a California shroom by Paul myself Spires are that same shroom X. I'm gonna die.

[211:41.18]No.
[211:47.18]Yeah, so the last couple minutes didn't happen.
[211:51.36]So we actually did not talk about anything that we talked about.
[211:56.94]Including or pertaining to potentially sitting down on a toilet and warming it before you use it.
[212:14.14]Yeah, we're gonna have to talk about it again.
[212:16.56]It's true.
[212:21.16]Alright, so why was I in there in the first place?
[212:23.14]I actually don't remember.

[212:51.51]I went there for CDs.
[212:53.29]Hey, look it.
[212:53.97]I ended up with a bunch of CDs.
[212:56.83]Isn't that something?
[213:10.68]What was I going to do after that?
[213:12.47]I don't know.

[220:14.91]Inventory is fucking full.
[220:22.50]I'm drinking all these.
[220:30.04]Make some inventory room.
[220:38.83]Do I put deodorant on before or after I put my shirt on?
[220:42.00]Before.
[220:47.42]It depends.
[220:49.88]Did I just get out of the shower or something?
[220:56.55]See, I don't like putting it on after because I don't like stretching out my shirts.
[221:09.47]Why do I take so much of useless crap with me?
[221:12.77]Um... I've just been picking up a lot of shit.
[221:17.25]All the stuff here, I've picked it up.
[221:19.56]Except for this crab.
[221:21.34]But, you know.
[221:22.48]Sometimes you gotta have a crab in your inventory.

[224:08.76]I don't care.
[224:13.11]I'll do it some other time.

[224:19.84]You father.
[224:25.00]Do you like people and do you own a family?
[224:29.47]I do not own a family.
[224:32.17]The wording is a little strange.
[224:35.17]I have a family.
[224:36.31]If you're wondering if I have kids or a wife, the answer is no.
[224:45.09]There's no ring on this finger.
[224:49.97]Not on this finger.
[225:00.83]Making good progress down here.
[225:07.29]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.

[225:14.61]The captain of all the Schneiders.
[225:17.12]See, he's got a family, too.
[225:18.26]He's a Schneider.

[225:24.46]Thanks for stopping.
[225:24.94]Appreciate it.
[225:25.96]Welcome to the family.
[225:29.00]Welcome to the family where we talk about warming toilet seats.
[225:33.40]That's what we do around here.
[225:45.31]Care about these dumb mushrooms.
[225:47.79]Haven't done anything.
[225:48.51]And get the fucking crab out of here too.
[225:50.78]Trash.
[225:56.32]Do I ever show my noggin on stream?
[225:58.64]Yeah.
[226:02.01]I don't like to do facecam unless it actually has a purpose.
[226:08.34]Because I feel like it takes away from what you're watching on the screen.
[226:11.22]Like, yeah, I don't know.
[226:11.90]Whenever I watch people with face cameras, half my time I'm like, oh, what's their face look like?
[226:16.26]And I'm missing what they're doing.
[226:20.32]But I'm not against it.
[226:22.16]I just don't really typically do it.
[226:23.70]If you want to see my face, really all you have to do is just type Jerma into Google and it'll pop up.
[226:31.40]It's scary, though.
[226:32.12]I warn you, it is fucking scary.
[226:36.60]Anything else up here?
[226:44.62]Almost at 110.
[226:45.00]I don't want to show my demon eyes.
[226:52.74]I just don't care.
[226:56.84]I just don't want to show my face.
[227:01.85]You all know what I look like.
[227:08.85]Plus, I make weird fucking faces.
[227:11.04]Let's go over this.
[227:12.86]I make weird faces when I play games.
[227:15.00]And if I get, like, into it, and I start to do, like, the... Like, I bite my lip, and I, like, my eyes squint around and stuff.
[227:21.76]It's... I don't know.
[227:22.45]I don't like it.
[227:23.91]It's 12 AM.
[227:24.39]Bye.
[227:34.15]Dig.
[227:35.56]Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.
[227:36.60]Go.
[227:37.80]Dig to the center of the Earth.
[227:40.89]Okay, let's go.
[227:43.31]Get me out of here.
[227:45.71]Oh shit, my inventory's full.
[227:49.79]Uh.
[227:58.03]Put it down.
[228:00.25]Let's go.
[228:02.35]Give me the chest.
[228:04.47]Space boots.
[228:07.03]Nice.
[228:08.51]Bye.
[228:10.31]See you later.
[228:15.70]Alright.
[228:22.80]Let's take a look.
[228:23.22]Let's pause.
[228:23.60]We can look at the moon shoes.
[228:25.80]Four, four.
[228:26.46]Those are just a straight up upgrade.
[228:28.06]I will put those on.
[228:33.53]Let's go back to bed.
[228:34.65]I don't care about the worms.
[228:45.42]Do I look at fan art?
[228:48.60]Yeah, from time to time, if somebody tweets it at me or something.
[228:52.61]I'll take a look at it.
[229:09.93]I'm gonna wake up tomorrow, throw these mushrooms into the dumpster.
[229:17.38]Why did I have to leave so suddenly?
[229:18.56]Because if it gets to be 2 AM, you pass out and you lose a bunch of money and sometimes items.
[229:48.53]Silo done?
[229:53.85]Does somebody want one of these?
[229:54.77]Where are the slimes?
[230:03.48]I need to hold on to the slimes, right?
[230:07.98]I don't care about the bomb.
[230:16.32]Get rid of these two.
[230:17.00]I'm done with this shit.
[230:25.45]I'm so done with that.
[230:33.95]Now I have gold ore.
[230:35.57]I can make some gold bars.
[230:39.15]Isn't that special?
[230:49.34]Silo done.
[230:53.66]Pieces of hay.
[230:54.72]Zero out of 240.
[230:59.66]I'm assuming that's a spring thing.
[231:01.94]How much hardwood do I have?
[231:14.54]How much hardwood?
[231:19.44]Okay, I know I can give this 10 hardwood, and that should complete one of the community center things, right?
[231:40.29]Gold watering can, that's right.
[231:42.23]You are correct.
[231:43.33]That does exist at this point, I would say.
[231:47.63]Let's go get it.
[231:49.61]Let's find out what else she can build after I go this way.
[232:00.28]Your bins gave me anxiety.
[232:11.79]That's funny.
[232:15.56]you can check oh right here you can check thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you well these are these have the other ones yeah they do just looking to see where the other ones are
[232:42.77]Yeah, summer, fall.
[232:44.61]I don't have any of this shit.
[232:45.75]Exotic foraging.
[232:55.90]Here we go.
[232:56.24]Construction.
[232:58.40]Do I have anything else I can bring?
[233:13.05]Oh, poop.
[233:18.81]Nope.
[233:21.05]This is the fish tank.
[233:21.93]I don't care about that.
[233:22.79]Hey, blacksmithing bundle.
[233:25.80]I can do that.
[233:30.44]Adventurer's bundle.
[233:32.84]Can't quite do this yet.
[233:35.16]Ah, shit.
[233:35.68]I needed one of those.
[233:36.38]I can get another one easily.
[233:40.81]and I can do this without the Earth crystal so I'll just do it later but I can do two of them where is the community center again over here oh I'm yawning not good not good
[234:15.20]hey good morning morning cocky badger I did not give the wizard that void thing yet I should probably do that first let me do this
[234:48.10]Bundle complete.
[234:48.80]A furnace.
[234:57.98]Okay.
[235:02.25]Thanks for the furnace.
[235:03.05]Actually, I needed another one.
[235:11.21]Can't do this one.
[235:13.93]Can't do this one.
[235:19.26]What was the, uh... It was a new one, huh?
[235:23.74]Damn, there's so many of these bundles to do.
[235:28.21]Jeez.
[235:28.59]Ugh.
[235:33.99]There's too many items to keep track of.
[235:37.19]I think there are so many of these bundles to keep track of.
[235:45.36]I'm never gonna complete all these.
[235:57.18]What was the one I could... with the hardwood?
[235:58.80]Is that one down here?
[236:03.67]Yeah, this one.
[236:04.39]Construction bundle.
[236:14.21]Charcoal kiln.
[236:17.93]20 pieces of wood in there.
[236:18.75]That's actually pretty useful.
[236:24.17]Still need a winter root.
[236:25.21]I still need a snow yam.
[236:26.53]I had one of these too.
[236:27.45]That's what sucks.
[236:28.27]I just completely forgot about it.
[236:29.79]Another bundle.
[236:40.51]Let's take a look.
[236:44.93]How many eggs do I eat each day?
[236:48.59]Eight.
[236:50.99]Ten.
[236:53.46]That's not true.
[236:58.67]Oh, damn.
[236:59.85]Ooh!
[237:05.06]What do you get for this?
[237:06.26]Bus repair?
[237:08.80]What do you get for 25?
[237:10.42]What do you get?
[237:10.80]25,000 gold.
[237:12.68]I'm doing it.
[237:17.39]This is so impulsive.
[237:18.25]No, I can't.
[237:18.79]It's too impulsive.
[237:33.49]I got the money.
[237:34.76]I have the money.
[237:36.22]I'm gonna do 2,500.
[237:39.26]I can afford that one.
[237:43.14]Three shits.
[237:45.92]What's this, 10,000?
[237:46.18]I can afford 5,000.
[237:46.80]I can do it.
[237:48.01]I can afford it.
[237:48.53]Ooh!
[237:48.63]Ooh!
[237:57.88]I can afford it.
[237:58.36]10,000.
[237:58.38]We did it.
[238:03.48]Lightning rod.
[238:06.46]Wow, that's actually really cool.
[238:12.30]Alright, we got 10 grand.
[238:13.06]I'm good.
[238:16.46]I should have just done the $25,000 one.
[238:17.18]Immediately.
[238:36.04]Should have done the 25k.
[238:41.63]At least I have this now.
[238:42.41]I can get free battery packs when it rains.
[238:45.49]And I have quality fertilizer.
[238:58.76]Okie dokie.
[239:01.52]It's time... to...
[239:07.10]Go back.
[239:07.44]Because I want to upgrade my hoe.
[239:13.96]So I need to make one more copper bar.
[239:15.95]And bring to the blacksmith so he can make me a copper hoe.
[239:24.11]And I can put my lightning rod down.
[239:30.76]It's a Tesla coil.
[239:31.84]If somebody gets too close, it'll just shock them.
[239:36.71]book was in the same spot whatever
[240:11.93]Okay, I have nine quality sprinklers.
[240:13.91]I think that's going to be good.
[240:14.71]As long as I plant a quart, because that's eight.
[240:18.95]So let's just say eight times ten is eighty.
[240:22.82]So I can water eighty crops.
[240:26.18]Plus, you know, the extra fourteen from this.
[240:29.20]I don't think I'm going to have more than a hundred crops.
[240:33.12]At least in the spring.
[240:35.96]You know?
[240:41.54]Where's my copper?
[240:42.33]There it is.
[240:47.73]Alright.
[240:48.01]I'm going to wait until that's done.
[240:49.49]I'm going to go grab a snack.
[240:53.95]And probably go pee again.
[240:56.45]So, I'll be back.
[243:35.76]Oh, fuck.
[243:36.46]Ouch.
[243:36.76]Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.
[243:38.04]Finger, finger.
[243:38.80]Ow, finger, thumb, and thumb.
[243:41.99]What's happening to me?
[243:48.49]4 p.m.
[243:49.07]Ah, it's almost time to go back to bed.
[243:56.04]There's my five.
[243:56.92]Let's go upgrade my hoe.
[244:08.20]No, I didn't bottle up my pee.
[244:11.02]This is the snack I was talking about.
[244:14.92]What is this?
[244:15.40]Can you guess what this is?
[244:16.23]This is my snack.
[244:29.13]Oh, this asshole closes at four, doesn't he?
[244:35.99]You motherfucker.
[244:41.50]Nope.
[244:44.04]Shut up, Pam.
[244:45.96]Pam.
[244:46.68]Hey, Pam.
[244:47.78]Get a life.
[244:58.55]No, fuck you, Pierre.
[244:59.59]You're not getting anything.
[245:01.81]I want to give this chocolate cake to somebody.
[245:03.39]I have three chocolate cakes.
[245:06.81]No, it's not protein.
[245:07.63]I mean, it has protein in it.
[245:11.94]It's not a juice.
[245:14.20]It's kind of an odd drink, to be honest.
[245:19.14]It's kefir!
[245:19.99]It's like a yogurt smoothie, essentially.
[245:42.68]Lightning rod, I guess the lightning rod can go.
[245:44.82]If this is too close to my house, is that gonna cause a problem?
[245:53.44]K-E-F-I-R.
[245:55.25]K-E-F-I-R.
[245:56.85]Kefir.
[246:00.87]It's good.
[246:01.33]It's got probiotics and all that shit, you know?
[246:06.17]It's got probiotics and shit.
[246:09.73]Back to bed.
[246:13.85]layers of fear it is a cultured milk cultured low-fat milk smoothie probiotic blueberry that's a lot of money oh that is a lot of money
[246:44.23]Lifeway, that is correct.
[246:45.47]That is correct.
[246:48.07]Do I have any more iron ore?
[247:04.08]I thought I had hundreds of it.
[247:07.82]Yeah, I do.
[247:14.65]Now let's go upgrade the pick for crying out loud.
[247:21.04]Greg, sorry to bother you again, but I need another favor.
[247:22.92]I've got a new hammer and I want to try it on a variety of metals.
[247:25.84]Could you smell an iron bar and bring it to me?
[247:27.71]Thanks, Clint.
[247:28.45]Yeah, sure.
[247:36.83]Let's wait till these are done.
[247:46.63]You'd pay to see a Jerma healthy eating special video.
[247:51.99]I don't really eat that healthy.
[247:53.07]I mean, I eat, like... I just don't really drink, like, soda that much anymore.
[248:02.09]And I don't eat fast food, really, at all.
[248:06.65]That's pretty much it.
[248:08.46]I still eat, you know, big, like, large subs and stuff all the time.
[248:14.47]But really what I've been into is I've been into chicken gyros.
[248:17.15]We talked about this, I think, a couple days ago.
[248:20.13]Oh, chicken gyros is so good.
[248:22.13]They're not really that bad for you either.
[248:31.60]You want me to turn the TV around?
[248:39.10]It's going to be a beautiful sunny day, really.
[248:40.84]You want me to turn the TV around?
[248:43.50]Is that what you want?
[248:49.88]There.
[248:51.92]That's even more useless.
[248:54.89]How do you even rotate things?
[248:57.39]R?
[248:57.77]Or what?
[248:58.93]Left and right?
[248:59.43]I don't even know how you do it.
[249:08.10]Yeah, they are.
[249:08.52]It's Greek.
[249:13.54]It is a Greek food.
[249:14.64]That is correct.
[249:22.34]And sprinklers.
[249:35.69]Tapper.
[249:40.45]I can make some stuff here, but I don't think I want to.
[249:45.81]Yeah, I don't think I want to.
[249:54.22]Yeah, tzatziki.
[249:55.08]I just love tzatziki sauce.
[249:57.06]Tzatziki sauce!
[250:00.22]It is fantastic.
[250:04.68]I'm gonna put two chocolate cakes in here.
[250:08.20]No, no.
[250:08.76]Not that.
[250:18.15]Five.
[250:18.73]Okay, let's go.
[250:28.88]If I wasn't so lazy, I would make... Somehow figure out a good recipe and make a gyro every day.
[250:34.24]It's like the perfect food, in my opinion.
[250:38.92]It's so great.
[250:44.45]Just take it as a pain in the ass.
[250:46.47]That's why you pay a restaurant to do it for you.
[250:52.39]Favorite band is the Gorillaz.
[250:55.55]And they have a new album coming out this year.
[250:58.33]Excited to hear that.
[251:01.79]Nice.
[251:05.30]So how far does it go?
[251:09.26]Okay.
[251:11.08]That's really... That's really cool.
[251:15.72]This thing's amazing.
[251:16.60]Alright, upgrade tools.
[251:18.40]Actually, no, no, no.
[251:18.96]Process my shit first.
[251:21.79]Take a look at my shit.
[251:22.71]Tell me this is it.
[251:23.55]Look at my stool.
[251:30.49]That's new.
[251:32.61]Hematite.
[251:33.35]Well, I can donate some stuff.
[251:38.64]See you later.
[251:39.14]Yeah, gold watering can, man.
[251:44.04]Sometimes you need a gold watering can.
[251:45.44]You need gold everything.
[251:46.60]I need everything upgraded.
[251:48.14]As much as it can be.
[251:53.89]I already had one of those.
[251:55.63]Apparently.
[251:56.09]Here you go.
[252:24.29]A lot of money.
[252:37.80]Favorite game of all time?
[252:38.68]That's uh... That's a tough one.
[252:40.52]I don't know.
[252:46.81]I have like a top 10.
[252:47.45]Or a top 5.
[252:59.96]What's next on the list?
[253:03.95]Is there anything else on the list?
[253:07.59]To prepare for the spring.
[253:09.05]I bet he'll be offended with another one, probably.
[253:31.99]Can make another one.
[253:32.79]Oh, now I'm gonna hold on to my stuff.
[253:34.20]I want, um... Quality fertilizer.
[253:40.92]This is the next step.
[253:42.06]Because I have 30, I want, like, 80.
[253:43.36]Gotta go catch a shitload of fish.
[253:49.56]Doesn't matter what they are.
[253:50.28]Okay.
[254:00.27]Fishing pole.
[254:02.87]Let's go catch a bunch of fish.
[254:18.01]Yeah, 18 hour work days.
[254:19.77]Really?
[254:20.39]It's crazy.
[254:30.24]You like those emotes?
[254:31.80]Yeah.
[254:33.82]There's more coming too.
[254:43.81]I'm a French.
[254:48.83]I can't wait to do pallbearer.
[254:51.73]Pallbearer is gonna be taking over the whole stream.
[254:54.17]It's gonna be amazing.
[254:57.37]I gotta find the perfect pallbearer eclipse.
[255:06.20]Oh, I know exactly what I'm doing with those.
[255:07.62]Just putting them on here.
[255:13.75]Although it doesn't really matter, I guess.
[255:18.31]I'm just using these to make a really good, nice bait.
[255:36.21]Did I ever do a second run of Undertale?
[255:37.85]Yes.
[255:41.27]I got like probably 70% of the way, 80% of the way through it again.
[255:47.34]I'm just going to stop playing it.
[255:50.48]Did not finish it.
[255:54.23]I sort of moved on.
[255:56.41]I put like 15 hours into the game or something.
[255:59.33]Played through it two times pretty much.
[256:03.78]I got what I wanted out of it, and I was done with it.
[256:15.97]jermaEarth is legit the creepiest emote on Twitch.
[256:22.52]Yeah, it's just the Earth, man.
[256:44.32]Yeah, I did get better hooks and bait.
[256:47.22]I'm just... Literally, these fish are instantly being transformed into fertilizer, so I'm not looking for quality fish.
[256:55.14]Just looking to get them.
[257:01.79]You little bastard.
[257:02.63]33 inches.
[257:08.01]Cool.
[257:27.25]Jupiter, Mars.
[257:29.39]I'm just going to do the important planets.
[257:31.87]The ones that matter.
[257:33.61]You know?
[257:36.07]Because I don't even have enough emote slots.
[257:40.49]I believe I can have like 10 emote slots.
[257:46.50]So I don't think I can even do everything.
[257:49.32]I already have the sun and the moon.
[257:55.46]What is this?
[257:57.51]Okay.
[258:08.06]Pluto's just gonna be tiny.
[258:10.25]It's gonna be a little teeny circle.
[258:25.43]Yeah, I know you get milestones for subs.
[258:30.01]It's like, what, 5, 10, 15, 20, or something like that.
[258:40.52]No, yeah, I have 10.
[258:41.70]I have 10 slots.
[258:42.36]Just need to fill them.
[258:50.75]This thing is not going to catch, apparently.
[259:12.71]Mercury sucks.
[259:13.57]I didn't know you had that strong of an opinion on planets.
[259:32.39]Oh, I had you.
[259:33.29]I already had you.
[259:34.71]Now to letting you get away.
[259:42.24]I keep thinking he's going to launch up like that.
[259:48.69]You annoying little shit.
[259:53.69]Why is the sun the only one that's a circle?
[259:55.85]Because it's the sun.
[259:58.01]It has to be different.
[260:04.07]Those ones are so annoying.
[260:07.47]Those things are so fucking erratic.
[260:09.01]How are you ever supposed to catch those?
[260:20.14]My favorite thing about that emote, as everyone said, when I first showed it to people, they were like... It looks like a pepperoni.
[260:27.37]Or like a cheese puff.
[260:30.23]Doesn't even look like the sun.
[260:32.91]It really kind of just looks like a Cheeto.
[260:35.43]And that's why it's staying forever.
[260:51.75]Dorito meatball.
[260:59.58]It's just a meatball pepperoni.
[261:02.06]It isn't a pepperoni.
[261:03.76]No, it's the sun.
[261:11.81]The fact that people think that it's a pepperoni is so... I love that a lot.
[261:17.93]I will never change that emote.
[261:19.71]It's gonna be that awful forever.
[261:40.20]Burnt pancake.
[261:42.36]It's the first time I've heard that.
[261:59.94]Don't be erratic, don't be erratic!
[262:04.42]Give me the treasure!
[262:09.41]So I guess I'm getting a lot more treasure chests.
[262:11.03]Is that because I have that thing in my inventory?
[262:13.35]It makes sense, right?
[262:20.79]Copper and a geode.
[262:23.09]Cool.
[262:32.89]Why are my emotes planets?
[262:35.61]I have no idea.
[262:38.47]I made the moon, and that was it.
[262:40.53]And I was like, okay, that's what's happening.
[262:43.19]There's no reason for it.
[262:46.33]I can't give you one, because I don't know.
[263:00.96]Ooh, anchor.
[263:01.98]Uh...
[263:10.42]Getting a couple of artifacts here.
[263:11.61]I straight up could not even figure out what it was.
[263:25.55]That's the beauty, right?
[263:38.59]last one we should have enough or maybe not how many fish should I call like 12 15 or something
[264:08.87]Quality fertilizer.
[264:13.51]Okay.
[264:21.42]Sap is in the chest.
[264:31.11]Nobody looking.
[264:32.87]Trash digging.
[264:33.75]Nothing.
[264:34.93]Nothing.
[264:44.88]Jupiter should be a BF.
[264:47.19]I have a couple of ideas for Jupiter.
[264:48.55]I'm not sure if they're going to work or not, but it'd be funny if they did.
[264:51.91]I literally just used this in another channel of streaming.
[264:57.99]Oh, God.
[264:58.65]What is that?
[265:06.26]Where am I going?
[265:10.08]Oh, wait a minute.
[265:11.00]Can I talk to the wizard?
[265:11.86]Didn't I have something for the wizard?
[265:16.33]Yes.
[265:16.93]Is he open right now?
[265:17.55]How the fuck do I get to the wizard?
[265:37.30]Come on, be open.
[265:39.44]Yeah.
[265:42.96]I've got something for you.
[265:48.17]Whoa!
[265:51.57]That was worth a thousand gold?
[265:53.67]Holy shit.
[265:55.63]Okay, well you pay well.
[265:56.61]I'm going to do his quest from now on.
[265:59.56]You pay handsomely.
[266:06.08]That's the most I've ever gotten for anything.
[266:08.62]Any quest has been the maximum I've ever received.
[266:13.17]Am I going the right way here?
[266:14.09]Can I get out of here this way?
[266:16.67]I hope so.
[266:40.03]Winner.
[266:42.01]God, it's such a harsh winner.
[266:43.13]Where's my sap?
[267:01.21]Quality fertilizer. 46.
[267:16.33]Still have to give that cake to somebody.
[267:19.75]Ooh.
[267:22.61]Trap bobber?
[267:26.29]Cool.
[267:35.54]He transmutes all his money.
[267:37.22]Two chocolate cakes are worth 400 gold.
[267:52.67]Every morning I have to do that to get me pumped.
[268:06.59]The Feast of the Winter Star.
[268:08.87]It's a time for the community to come together and think back on all the good fortune we've had this year.
[268:14.01]Secret Gift Exchange, where everyone in town is randomly assigned to someone else.
[268:18.33]On the day of the festival, everyone brings a gift for their secret friend and surprise them with something special.
[268:23.99]This year, your secret friend is... Maru.
[268:31.41]Don't tell anyone.
[268:32.34]The feast will take place on the 25th.
[268:35.70]In the town square.
[268:36.76]Okay.
[268:43.42]Chocolate cake.
[268:44.34]That's who's getting it.
[268:44.98]Okay, I get some things to donate.
[268:51.73]Two things to donate.
[268:55.81]And then I'm gonna do more fishing.
[268:59.35]What an exhilarating stream, huh?
[269:02.87]Just... just Exil writing.
[269:05.69]Fishing all day.
[269:22.01]Give her a soggy newspaper.
[269:23.47]That would be so awful.
[269:39.88]Seeing this game for the first time, looks like a third-party Harvest Moon successor.
[269:42.71]I'll take it.
[269:44.01]Yeah, it's really good.
[269:48.11]The amount of depth this game has is shocking, really.
[269:52.05]You have until 9am to fish here.
[270:05.68]What do I enjoy more, streaming or YouTube?
[270:09.08]They're two different breeds.
[270:13.19]I like streaming because I can just kind of relax and just hang out and chill and play games and talk to you guys.
[270:18.71]YouTube is more for, like, video making, right?
[270:23.82]Like, if I have, like, an idea that I want to do or I have a game that I want to play and make a video on, they're two totally... I like them both equally.
[270:31.88]I think YouTube is something that I'm just more used to doing, because it's been like five years since I've started my YouTube channel.
[270:38.92]And I've really only been streaming, technically, a handful of times in like 2012.
[270:46.53]Some a little bit in like 2013.
[270:49.35]And then like two months ago.
[270:52.19]So obviously YouTube's a little more comfortable at the moment for me, but I'm heavily enjoying streaming.
[270:58.78]It's been a lot of fun.
[271:00.56]So...
[271:02.59]YouTube is more for video making.
[271:04.16]Brilliant.
[271:04.82]Well, you know what I mean.
[271:06.98]Making videos.
[271:09.92]Streaming?
[271:10.58]I'm not making a video right now.
[271:12.92]I'm just playing this game.
[271:15.44]For like 30 hours.
[271:22.68]I wouldn't upload something like this to YouTube, is what I'm saying.
[271:25.87]Like, YouTube is more for, like, produced content.
[271:29.67]That I... Oh yeah, I have this idea, I wanna do this, I have this game I wanna play, I wanna do this and this and this.
[271:37.42]Yeah, this is more like a broadcast than it is a video.
[271:48.24]No, I wouldn't even say editing is the word I'm looking for.
[271:50.94]Because I could edit this.
[271:53.34]I could edit together my entire time playing this game, but it still wouldn't be, like, a, like, produced video.
[272:25.28]Alright, let's go to the blacksmith.
[272:39.11]Now, I mean, have I uploaded videos to YouTube before that were, like, kind of cut up live?
[272:44.76]Like, the highlights of, like, something like this?
[272:46.60]Yeah, of course I have.
[272:48.75]But I go into like YouTube with the idea of a general theme of some type of video.
[272:55.72]Not necessarily I'm going to just kind of play a video game for like 40 hours.
[273:03.43]Still don't have that done.
[273:20.71]Take the fucking jellyfish cake.
[273:23.29]And the anchor.
[273:25.47]Yes!
[273:34.16]A skeleton man?
[273:34.98]I don't want a skeleton man.
[273:56.01]Yeah, it's like 5 or 6 in the morning here, East Coast.
[273:59.69]Don't ask me why I'm still awake.
[274:02.27]I don't know why.
[274:10.68]Can I, like, scare somebody with that?
[274:15.68]Time to fish.
[274:18.46]Back to fish.
[274:36.43]Can you eventually cast further?
[274:39.69]Something about... I feel like my brain wants to see that go further.
[274:44.34]You know what I mean?
[274:48.78]Like... Throw it really far out there.
[275:13.37]Yeah, Sky Ninja.
[275:14.21]I look at just the two platforms a little differently.
[275:23.60]They're both fun.
[275:24.70]I like doing both of them a lot.
[275:28.54]I wouldn't be streaming for... I'm gonna lose this one.
[275:30.68]See ya.
[275:31.44]No, I'm not.
[275:41.36]He got really tired.
[275:43.02]He tired himself out after the first, like, pull there.
[275:45.39]No, he's still going.
[275:49.03]You are still going.
[275:53.59]What the hell?
[275:55.40]It's almost impossible to keep up with that.
[275:57.12]And I thought I was gonna get him, too.
[276:02.82]Oh, my lord!
[276:03.66]The real move's so slow, you just can't even keep up with him.
[276:31.10]Pride snapped the line.
[276:32.42]It's probably an eel.
[276:48.82]Use the mouse.
[276:49.56]Yeah, but that requires my hand to go over here and I just want to be a lazy shithead right now.
[276:57.92]I'm gonna just be able to lean back like this and just press X and not even care.
[277:04.24]Not a care in the world.
[277:11.68]What the hell did I just do?
[277:21.84]Linkot and Catfish, yeah, they're difficult to grab.
[277:30.89]Fish in real life?
[277:31.69]Have I been fishing?
[277:32.53]No.
[277:33.67]I can't stand fishing in real life.
[277:37.24]It bores the absolute hell out of me.
[277:42.20]Oh, there you go.
[277:42.78]Bye.
[277:53.45]I gotta get this one.
[277:55.12]This one came with a treasure chest.
[278:09.70]With coal, that's it?
[278:10.52]Yeah, you can't fish up treasure chests in real life, it's boring.
[278:32.40]Wow, yikes.
[278:35.38]That one got away.
[278:41.59]Hey, good night boss.
[278:42.77]Thanks for coming out.
[278:45.31]I keep forgetting about daylight savings time and how I'm turning my life upside down right now by being awake at like 6 a.m.
[278:52.05]Give me an overview for the features of the game.
[279:05.02]Yeah, I mean, it's essentially you get a farm and you're tasked with just running the farm.
[279:14.17]There's crops.
[279:14.71]There's all the four seasons.
[279:16.91]There's 28 townspeople.
[279:18.89]You can marry people in the game.
[279:20.27]You can talk to pretty much anybody.
[279:21.81]People have their own cutscenes and quests.
[279:25.63]There are town events, like you were asking.
[279:27.67]It's like a
[279:31.81]town fair in the fall or in the whatever it was the summer or something there's a bunch of different crops you have to tend them you sell them some are worth more than others some can regrow it's just a super addicting game there is nothing in this game that I can tell you I don't like
[280:03.30]There's not much I can say that I don't like.
[280:07.74]If I were to think of one thing that I don't like in the game, it might be... And this is just because I'm impatient.
[280:17.69]My impatience and the fact that some of the crops take like 14 in-game days to grow.
[280:24.47]My ADHD goes nuts.
[280:26.49]And it's just such a long time for my brain.
[280:29.72]But that's like a personal thing.
[280:30.62]That's not like a thing they've not liked the game over.
[280:37.71]There's a mine.
[280:40.27]You go down the mine and you attack monsters and shit and there's a hundred plus levels to the mine.
[280:45.73]There's a lot of content.
[280:52.34]And it's 15 bucks.
[280:58.69]There's a crop that takes 28 days to grow.
[281:00.71]My god.
[281:01.31]Uh, I would...
[281:07.73]Chop that up, but I don't have my hoe with me.
[281:20.06]You can get animals, which I don't have yet.
[281:22.96]I just barely got a silo.
[281:32.55]Was there 110 in the mine?
[281:33.19]115?
[281:33.21]Something like that.
[281:38.89]Yeah, multiplayer is coming.
[281:39.99]This is... Now, what you're looking at right now, if you just joined the stream or the person that asked the question about it, there's nothing here because it's the wintertime and nothing... There's like only special seeds that can grow during the winter.
[281:53.12]So I don't have like a farm right now.
[281:56.40]But in like 10 days, this is all going to be turned into farmland and I'll be able to put seeds down and... You joined at kind of an odd time.
[282:07.35]Because the winter is very much a gather resources kind of month.
[282:18.98]This should get me 61.
[282:23.44]I think that's good for now.
[282:27.90]Yeah, that's good.
[282:30.60]Let's put Skeletor in here, or Papyrus, whatever you want to call him.
[282:37.32]He'll protect me from the monsters that try to get me from underneath my bed.
[282:39.90]I can't put him there.
[282:45.21]Okay.
[282:46.85]Good night.
[282:47.17]Okay.
[283:00.28]Back to the mine, I would say.
[283:02.46]Yeah, I'm going back to the mine.
[283:10.16]Let's get rid of most of this shit.
[283:16.32]So we can have a full inventory for the mine.
[283:18.34]Put the trash in the recycling machine.
[283:43.70]Come by the shop and check out the new rods I'm selling.
[283:45.98]Ooh!
[283:46.92]The best money can buy.
[283:48.38]And you can customize them with different kinds of tackle.
[283:52.24]Alright, new plan.
[283:53.28]We're going to do that.
[283:56.74]That's exactly what I'm going to do.
[284:16.18]Willy.
[284:18.02]Let me take a nice close look at your rod, Willy.
[284:21.53]Close up.
[284:28.15]What is that?
[284:29.98]Actually, I need one of these, actually.
[284:33.98]I'm certain that this is part of some... I'm in the community center.
[284:47.03]I always want to go in his house, but he never wants to let me in.
[285:03.02]Okay, I'll just watch you fish for a little bit.
[285:10.80]So, no pressure or anything.
[285:12.70]I didn't even bring my rod.
[285:18.32]Well, that gives me a time to drink some of my snack.
[285:28.95]I'm running out of room on my desk.
[285:38.00]Come on, pull the reel in and go in your fucking house.
[285:41.58]Before I huff and I puff and I blow your house down.
[285:52.40]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[285:55.20]Go.
[285:56.34]Go.
[285:57.64]Thank God.
[286:03.89]Let me see your new fishing rods.
[286:09.15]Ooh.
[286:13.81]7,500.
[286:15.47]That's a lot.
[286:17.05]Done deal.
[286:20.91]Done deal.
[286:21.87]I did it.
[286:29.13]Lead bobber.
[286:41.04]Don't I already have some of these?
[286:43.14]Are these better than the ones I already have?
[286:44.50]No, I have some.
[286:46.80]I don't have some.
[286:50.24]Let's check it out.
[286:53.78]Oh, look at how far that goes.
[286:55.88]That's awesome.
[286:58.88]What an expensive rod.
[287:11.45]You can craft them yourself, yeah.
[287:12.61]I'm gonna test it out and see what I can grab.
[287:18.71]And we get a special Cheshire Trest.
[287:26.08]Doesn't some dude want a squid?
[287:28.88]Octopus or something.
[287:29.84]Ooh.
[287:31.34]What does that mean?
[287:34.12]Old Mariner.
[287:36.68]I don't know what that means.
[287:38.78]Some kind of achievement, though.
[287:45.37]Why do so many games have fishing?
[287:46.71]Well, I'm going to assume it has something to do with the fact that it's probably really easy to implement.
[287:54.01]And it's really addicting.
[287:55.85]Which is kind of fun to do.
[287:59.07]Ugh, this picked up like a sea caterpillar.
[288:05.39]It's cold, too.
[288:24.29]Another one.
[288:26.09]Another sea slug.
[288:40.08]That's that's a caterpillar Look at it.
[288:44.52]It's a caterpillar and a sponge mashed together with a hammer Sorry Alright, I'm going to the mine last cast
[289:11.51]Yes, Tom, you can expect a new wrestling video.
[289:15.59]In a couple months.
[289:18.57]For sure.
[289:23.61]For certain.
[289:28.08]How much do these feed?
[289:29.38]Minus 45 energy.
[289:29.92]That is not cool.
[289:45.44]Well, hey Zeus.
[289:47.19]Have a nice night.
[289:48.05]Thanks for coming up.
[289:49.97]Good night.
[290:06.46]Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.
[290:11.57]You know...
[290:14.30]I could probably fish in that lava with an actual tackle box.
[290:23.16]Whatever the hell you use.
[290:23.96]110, 15, so 120.
[290:32.42]Can I get to 120?
[290:32.90]Let's go for it.
[290:43.80]I got an empty inventory, except for the fish.
[290:46.98]I'm ready to rock and roll.
[290:54.29]I'm prepared.
[290:55.15]I have plenty of food.
[290:56.07]I got berries.
[290:58.23]A couple of golden fish.
[291:03.04]I think I'm going to get to the bottom.
[291:11.02]Full health.
[291:21.93]Well, I'm not going to fish the lava yet until I get an actual tackle bait bobber thing, whatever.
[291:28.75]And attach it to the rod.
[291:31.76]Otherwise, I might be wasting my time.
[291:34.00]Something I don't want to do.
[291:39.44]Just crit him for over a hundred.
[291:42.32]Wow.
[291:44.77]Shit.
[291:52.42]Except for the gumball.
[291:55.22]The gumballs actually are the easiest enemy.
[291:57.70]They die in one hit.
[292:02.72]Two thoroughboots.
[292:06.00]No, I already replaced these a long time ago.
[292:13.48]Just want to take a look.
[292:17.20]Nothing up here.
[292:20.42]Except for the one armored goomba.
[292:23.55]Okay, well, fuck you.
[292:24.19]You stay up there.
[292:24.73]I don't care anymore.
[292:34.06]Stop?
[292:34.28]You're making me want to play this game?
[292:35.38]Well, isn't that a good thing?
[292:36.16]The game's fun, it's cheap, and it's got a lot to do.
[292:48.79]Emerald.
[292:49.39]Nice.
[292:51.41]Another emerald.
[292:53.32]That's two emeralds.
[293:04.61]These are the best boots in the game?
[293:07.25]Well, that's good to know, I guess.
[293:11.17]Oh, you little shit.
[293:16.36]Out of here.
[293:20.06]That's a Chrono Trigger enemy.
[293:22.14]That enemy is from Chrono Trigger.
[293:25.38]When you go to the garbage area.
[293:28.28]The dude that you speed bikes against.
[293:30.43]You ride and you sprint.
[293:32.49]What was his name?
[293:33.07]Johnny?
[293:34.61]Those enemies are everywhere.
[293:50.16]115, anything else?
[293:50.66]Nope.
[294:01.31]Closer and closer to the bottom of the cave.
[294:06.69]When we're gonna get there, I don't have any idea.
[294:11.99]Johnny Cash?
[294:15.63]Did you say Johnny Cat?
[294:16.87]Isn't it Johnny Cage?
[294:18.99]Johnny Cash is the guy with the guitar.
[294:20.59]The country singer.
[294:22.14]Heh, Johnny Cash.
[294:30.12]The Mortal Kombat character.
[294:31.52]These bats are annoying as all hell.
[294:52.20]Are you really stuck behind there?
[294:55.54]That was a shitload of iron.
[294:56.70]Okay.
[294:57.94]Cool.
[295:03.27]Yeah, these are going right into the bargain bin.
[295:06.05]I'm going to eat the sardine.
[295:18.78]The gold one.
[295:21.98]I did fucking nothing.
[295:25.50]There we go.
[295:37.69]So what's at the end?
[295:40.53]At the very bottom of this place, is there like a troll down there?
[295:42.73]Is there like a boss or something?
[295:44.29]I have to slay the dragon.
[296:01.36]What are bombs for?
[296:02.02]You can place them and they explode and everything around them gets destroyed.
[296:07.59]Except for trees, because I figured that out the hard way.
[296:11.17]It barely does anything to damn trees.
[296:12.75]You have to drop like two or three bombs to have a tree blow up.
[296:16.17]It's like bullshit.
[296:18.88]It should take one bomb.
[296:22.16]Makes me angry.
[296:29.93]I'm just going to skip this.
[296:35.09]Woo!
[296:39.01]Purple crystals.
[296:41.97]I can give one of those to... What's that girl's name?
[296:46.08]The one that I'm trying to get to like me?
[296:50.08]Abigail?
[296:52.78]Oh, shit.
[296:53.28]There's a lot of stuff down here.
[297:09.55]How do you repair the minecart?
[297:13.05]That's something I haven't really figured out yet.
[297:15.81]Do I need like a battery pack to stick in there?
[297:18.33]Shove it in.
[297:22.96]Shove it in the slot.
[297:33.54]Let's hit 119.
[297:37.89]Is that a diamond?
[297:38.41]I have like five diamonds now.
[297:43.02]I got a lot of diamonds.
[297:52.04]I need to eat something.
[297:52.78]I'm gonna eat it again.
[297:59.81]Oh, fuck.
[298:00.25]Time check.
[298:00.67]1030?
[298:01.27]Alright, gotta go, gotta go.
[298:07.08]Gotta go.
[298:07.78]Almost at the curfew.
[298:11.26]The curfew is 1130.
[298:20.02]This sucks because this... Thank God it's right here.
[298:22.69]Just go.
[298:23.15]I don't care.
[298:24.37]I made it.
[298:26.13]This is the... I did it.
[298:28.79]I made it to the bottom.
[298:30.49]The final chest.
[298:32.09]What's in it?
[298:35.68]A new journal entry.
[298:37.76]You found the skull key.
[298:38.80]You're not sure what it's for, but it seems important.
[298:40.62]It's been added to your wallet.
[298:44.56]The skull key.
[298:48.14]Uh... Okay.
[298:55.32]Alrighty.
[298:59.77]Does that turn the ignition on this?
[299:07.23]That's it, right?
[299:09.32]120.
[299:09.34]It looks like there's another row.
[299:14.42]Huh.
[299:16.66]Well, I gotta go back anyways.
[299:23.03]I'm running into my curfew.
[299:31.27]Sorry, worms.
[299:31.85]I'd love to scoop you up, but I can't.
[299:33.46]I gotta go.
[299:43.17]When's that festival?
[299:43.97]Is it tomorrow?
[299:48.20]There's some ice festival that's coming up.
[299:49.76]I don't know what the hell it's supposed to do about it.
[300:03.57]Get rid of these cucumbers.
[300:09.15]Actually, no, keep one.
[300:10.77]I'm feeling I'm going to need to use it somewhere.
[300:20.27]Red mullet.
[300:21.43]Eh, get rid of it.
[300:22.07]I don't care.
[300:25.75]I'll make my own bait.
[300:26.57]I have a lot of stuff to bring to the Adventurer's Guild.
[300:40.81]Okay, I can transmit gold.
[300:54.42]Not long till the end of winter.
[300:55.92]Yeah, look at all.
[300:59.96]I got like five items to sell to the Adventurer's Guild people.
[301:06.01]I got some Geodudes to break.
[301:08.22]Oh boy, what a task.
[301:20.28]Craft this down.
[301:31.65]Give one of these to Abigail.
[301:39.74]How many of those do I have?
[301:54.65]Organize them all.
[301:55.43]Get rid of this.
[301:59.39]What's green algae doing in here?
[302:01.12]Am I really holding on to green algae in here?
[302:07.14]What is the point of that?
[302:16.34]Okay.
[302:18.23]Okay, get some Geodudes.
[302:26.45]Get these in here.
[302:45.08]I'm gonna sell all this crap.
[302:56.09]Any more trash?
[303:01.13]No, I gotta hold on to these, though.
[303:02.31]I need ten Batwings.
[303:05.07]Right?
[303:10.41]Where's the adventurer's one?
[303:14.61]Ten bat wings, ninety-nine slimes, one into one.
[303:19.01]Ninety-nine slimes, holy god.
[303:23.46]That's gonna take a long time.
[303:30.36]Well, let's get rid of this junk and then I'll sell this thing.
[303:36.04]Algae, that crap, that... I can sell ten.
[303:45.10]Yeah, um.
[303:48.18]Put these back in.
[303:48.86]I'm going to put this back in.
[303:51.30]God, there's so much to do.
[303:53.85]So much stress.
[303:54.71]No, don't eat the cabin.
[304:08.19]Okay, the rest of this shit's coming with me.
[304:14.17]Alright.
[304:16.86]Time to sell.
[304:20.06]What do you mean?
[304:20.78]I only need two?
[304:21.32]What do you mean?
[304:22.40]Did it say ten?
[304:29.62]Ten, right?
[304:30.02]Ten Batwings?
[304:31.26]Oh, fuck!
[304:32.38]Oh, goodness!
[304:33.36]Oh, boy!
[304:38.38]Oh, boy!
[304:39.18]Okay.
[304:42.32]Um... Yeah, I only need two.
[304:47.03]That's easy.
[304:47.53]I already have them all.
[304:48.41]Alright, I got it.
[304:55.73]Let's do it.
[304:56.17]Let's go.
[305:00.76]I'm just so used to seeing that every single other one has four.
[305:04.54]I did not even notice that.
[305:07.60]Yeah, like all of them are like at least four or five.
[305:09.56]Two?
[305:10.76]Why would you ever do 99 slimes?
[305:12.10]That's like impossible.
[305:14.13]You have to save for so long.
[305:17.72]Okay, well let's... I'm gonna go do this right now.
[305:21.51]We'll do that on the way.
[305:29.29]What's my dog's name?
[305:30.03]It's Dogbandio.
[305:31.39]You know who it is?
[305:38.48]Community center it is.
[305:40.92]You did 99 slimes?
[305:43.04]Do you get something better if you do one of the harder ones or what?
[305:46.28]Or is it just whatever your preference is?
[305:49.11]Like whatever you care to do.
[306:07.05]Where is it?
[306:07.40]Over here?
[306:09.36]Get out of here, you little rats.
[306:25.06]Mmm, bang.
[306:27.63]Nice.
[306:33.69]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[306:39.07]Jamie Kinnosian.
[306:41.77]Jamie Kinnosian?
[306:42.67]Is that how you say it?
[306:44.35]Kinnosian?
[306:45.55]Kinnosian?
[306:47.03]Welcome, thanks for stopping.
[306:49.10]Very much appreciated.
[306:50.40]Much love.
[306:51.36]Welcome to the family.
[306:53.42]Enjoy your Earth.
[306:56.95]Slightly increases your radius for collecting items.
[307:02.93]Now this one... I need an Earth crystal.
[307:07.80]I can go... That's like the first... Okay, this is what we're going to do.
[307:11.14]We're going to wrap around.
[307:14.80]Thanks for being you, man.
[307:15.68]Well, thanks for subbing.
[307:17.96]Thanks for watching.
[307:23.54]So the plan is, we're gonna wrap around, we're gonna go down to the lower right, get rid of all the Geodudes, go back up, go to the first, like, five levels to get an Earth Crystal, sweep back around, over to the cottage that I'm in, bing bang boom, grab a couple of these, you know, grab another Frozen Tear and a Fire Quartz, complete this shit, activate the minecart, and then go for a fucking ride.
[307:52.10]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[307:57.64]And right after that, Mini Monk.
[308:00.31]Mini Monk, welcome.
[308:02.15]Thank you so much for subbing.
[308:04.99]I very much appreciate you guys.
[308:06.99]I love you guys.
[308:10.12]The love is just beaming from me.
[308:13.64]Have a thanks.
[308:16.08]Enjoy your Cheeto Dorito meatball, son.
[308:20.68]Where the hell am I going?
[308:21.34]I'm going the right way, right?
[308:32.51]Yeah, I'm gonna go to, like, level 5 or something.
[308:35.81]Like, 10.
[308:36.71]That's what the Earth crystals are in, like, the first 10 or 15, aren't they?
[308:40.77]Just gonna walk around and look for them.
[308:41.87]I just need one.
[308:51.02]Yeah, I know I got the other ones.
[308:51.96]The fire crystals and stuff.
[308:53.10]I just need an Earth crystal.
[308:54.56]Because I don't have one.
[308:59.31]Wooden club.
[309:01.81]More garbage to sell.
[309:02.67]Let's go.
[309:15.65]Let's go.
[309:18.53]Just trying to find an Earth crystal so I can finish that.
[309:25.07]Might be able to get it from a Geodude.
[309:26.91]Yeah.
[309:28.07]But I mean, what else am I going to do for the whole of today, you know?
[309:30.55]Might as well just check and see if I can grab one.
[309:35.61]And if I get one from a Geodude, then all the better.
[309:40.80]It's easy just to speedrun through these first like 50 levels.
[309:45.50]Looking for one that's just on the ground.
[309:55.05]an amethyst?
[309:57.67]Where the hell has that guy been where he has an amethyst?
[310:06.96]Nope.
[310:07.94]Not here.
[310:12.82]I could just go to bed for eight days, that's right.
[310:14.32]I just, I choose not to do that.
[310:18.60]Although I could.
[310:19.12]Okay.
[310:33.07]Hey, look at that.
[310:34.18]Got it.
[310:36.40]Goodbye.
[310:43.26]See ya.
[310:50.02]Going a bit early like all the good 30-year-olds.
[310:54.90]Have I even... They open at 2 p.m.
[310:57.86]Shit, I was really hoping I could wrap around.
[311:01.46]Still, I'm going to wrap around.
[311:02.28]I'm going to do all... Gosh darn it.
[311:12.57]Well, now we're just waiting here.
[311:14.05]I'm just going to fish.
[311:16.19]That blew my plan.
[311:19.25]Oh, you're old.
[311:25.89]That hurts.
[311:28.67]Hey, I don't like the word old.
[311:30.23]I like the word wise.
[311:31.39]A lot of Geodudes.
[311:55.97]Couple more.
[312:03.01]You don't have to be old to be wise.
[312:10.48]Oh no, what do you think?
[312:11.02]Am I old?
[312:11.44]Nah, he's a dog.
[312:14.82]He can't answer.
[312:23.89]Got a chub.
[312:33.06]I'm 42.
[312:36.07]My 43rd birthday is June 8th.
[312:57.47]Alright, let's go sell all this stuff.
[313:01.72]He's back!
[313:04.17]That didn't sound very nice.
[313:07.25]Oh my god.
[313:11.03]I don't have 25,000 gold.
[313:15.05]But that thing is a beast.
[313:16.30]I don't want this shit.
[313:31.12]What about boots?
[313:31.62]Do you have anything else?
[313:32.22]Dark boots?
[313:32.78]No.
[313:36.53]Uh, go to the bug meat.
[313:37.39]I don't need it right now.
[313:42.35]Alright.
[313:43.19]See ya.
[313:48.01]It's not even the best item in the game.
[313:49.23]Are you kidding me?
[313:55.41]How much more shit in the game is there?
[313:59.00]I'm already at, like, the bottom.
[314:01.86]What do I want to do?
[314:03.74]I want to go down here to the blacksmith.
[314:07.11]All the Geodudes.
[314:16.00]Oh!
[314:16.28]Oh!
[314:16.46]Just the person I wanted to see!
[314:17.32]Hey you!
[314:20.40]Take this!
[314:24.70]Still 2 out of 10!
[314:26.23]How is that even possible?
[314:27.47]I played your video game!
[314:32.12]And I've given you gifts every fucking, like, week.
[314:36.00]And you still... You still... I can't get past two with Abigail.
[314:43.94]Those things... Somebody said look at the journal.
[314:46.89]Oh.
[314:48.33]Discover the purpose of the skull key.
[314:55.11]Oh, I don't know where to go with you.
[314:56.29]Gotta keep giving you presents.
[315:10.13]Alright.
[315:13.61]Always check the trash.
[315:15.55]Spicy eel.
[315:17.55]Look at that.
[315:21.71]Now that's some shit right there.
[315:24.57]Throwing away a perfectly good spicy eel.
[315:40.31]That's why I was supposed to wrap around.
[315:41.79]I just fucked it up.
[315:43.79]So we're just gonna go to the community center.
[315:45.11]There's no going back.
[316:03.21]You're just gonna get older and older.
[316:04.73]Well, that's mildly depressing.
[316:14.15]shit in my hands and throw it into my fucking... I forgot to get this stupid thing.
[316:23.00]I thought I had one in my inventory because I had one here.
[316:34.09]I thought I had one in my inventory, but I didn't.
[316:49.50]Get out of my way, you kids.
[317:01.55]You're gonna talk to her every day?
[317:02.77]I'm gonna track her down every day?
[317:19.77]Alright.
[317:20.73]That's what I needed.
[317:21.37]Let me see.
[317:26.03]Is there anything else that I have that I can bring?
[317:27.57]Make sure I don't leave anything back.
[317:33.60]Okay.
[317:35.70]Nautilus.
[317:37.24]Chub.
[317:37.56]I have a Chub.
[317:39.46]I have a Nautilus.
[317:41.20]Do I have a Frozen Jew?
[318:03.47]I don't have the mushroom.
[318:06.63]Whatever.
[318:12.05]Back to bed.
[318:13.57]Bedtime.
[318:35.49]I need one of these.
[318:36.23]I think that's all I can do right now.
[318:49.15]I'm ready to ask you some hardwood.
[318:50.95]I need about ten pieces if you got it.
[318:53.66]No.
[318:56.12]Nope.
[318:57.12]Sorry.
[319:01.32]See, I didn't do that.
[319:02.24]I haven't been doing that.
[319:02.88]That's why I've been getting thrown off.
[319:08.12]Look at all these wipes.
[319:20.35]Can I rap?
[319:21.33]Not really.
[319:26.71]I do not believe I can.
[319:28.15]Okay.
[319:39.91]Where is he?
[319:40.29]Is he in here?
[319:42.13]Hey, you.
[319:44.21]Sleeping on the ground is good for my back.
[319:46.11]That's exactly what I was saying.
[319:50.04]I said that on Twitter today.
[319:53.16]This guy, we are destined to be friends.
[319:58.39]Do I have anything I can give him?
[319:59.27]Because we are truly destined to be friends.
[320:03.30]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[320:06.56]The only lemon.
[320:08.74]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[320:10.62]Welcome to the family.
[320:12.62]Does he like spicy eel?
[320:17.09]Should I give him the eel?
[320:18.49]He likes spicy food, right?
[320:21.73]Yeah, he likes sashimi.
[320:23.39]He'd probably like this too, wouldn't he?
[320:27.51]I'm giving it to him.
[320:28.81]This is wicked good.
[320:29.79]You know, it's delicious.
[320:30.79]He has to like it.
[320:31.63]This is a great gift.
[320:35.36]Thank you.
[320:35.82]You're very welcome.
[320:39.12]It's best to look at things the positive way.
[320:41.32]Yeah, it is.
[320:41.84]Now, what secrets can you tell me?
[320:54.25]Give him the spicy eel.
[320:58.76]I just did.
[320:59.26]He very much enjoyed it.
[321:02.38]Okay, now community center.
[321:13.65]He says the same thing about fruit.
[321:17.86]Did I go pie?
[321:19.00]No, it's right here.
[321:30.01]I love food.
[321:30.81]Ah, the fresh champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[321:41.17]Bimaos.
[321:42.49]Bimaos.
[321:44.39]Bimaeus.
[321:46.60]Thanks for seven.
[321:49.20]Welcome to the fresh fish family.
[321:51.72]We only eat fresh fish.
[321:57.50]The fuck is it?
[321:58.00]Oh.
[322:02.63]No, welcome.
[322:03.19]Thank you.
[322:04.51]Welcome to new subs.
[322:06.01]Say hello.
[322:07.05]Say hi.
[322:09.71]That's a pretty good reward.
[322:12.75]Oh, jeez.
[322:14.01]They're not going to attack me, are they?
[322:15.34]Yeah, the germino is keepers of the forest.
[322:27.26]Okay.
[322:29.78]That's all you're going to tell me?
[322:33.06]Okay, but I think I have to follow this guy.
[322:35.10]He just screamed something at me in, like, pig Latin.
[322:41.65]I'm gonna get you.
[322:42.33]I'm gonna get you!
[322:46.69]Take our most prized gift.
[322:50.07]A gingerbread cookie.
[322:53.00]It's a star.
[322:59.80]What do I do?
[323:05.72]He's just going to leave me alone now.
[323:06.86]Do you like berries?
[323:09.86]Take a berry.
[323:10.34]Oh, he's my friend.
[323:13.66]Okay.
[323:17.70]He's so happy.
[323:25.63]So I get it.
[323:26.05]They're like scared of you.
[323:27.67]Until you do something nice.
[323:34.28]I have so many things to break open.
[323:46.09]Quality crops, no.
[323:47.81]What about the berries?
[323:48.57]I have these berries.
[323:51.98]Can I not do anything with this bat shit?
[323:56.42]What's the point of me picking up all the bat shit if I can't do anything with it?
[324:06.02]Okay, bye.
[324:07.61]It's been fun.
[324:14.87]Now to the great unboxing.
[324:16.81]We go to the blacksmith.
[324:20.49]Get a snowy em?
[324:21.23]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[324:23.67]That's a good idea.
[324:31.31]First, we're breaking stuff open.
[324:40.41]Trash.
[324:44.77]Thanks for the free quartz.
[324:46.95]Whatever the hell it is.
[324:54.28]There was a very large chat debate on whether I should have gotten the mushrooms or the berries.
[325:00.84]And I'm not so sure.
[325:03.12]Hey, there's my copperhawk.
[325:13.00]Ooh.
[325:15.62]That's new.
[325:18.13]Celestine?
[325:19.21]Celestine?
[325:20.03]Celestine?
[325:25.07]Boston Cream Donut.
[325:28.39]Gold Ore.
[325:32.08]Pool Noodle.
[325:36.84]Nice.
[325:40.04]That's new.
[325:40.56]That's a bell.
[325:41.74]Dwarvish Helm.
[325:47.51]Second one of those.
[325:54.03]That's actually not bad.
[325:54.73]20.
[325:59.00]Cool.
[326:00.02]Thanks, dude.
[326:01.86]Uh... Steel hoe.
[326:07.76]No.
[326:11.97]Do I get anything I can donate?
[326:15.03]Anything new?
[326:16.49]Yeah, one of these.
[326:23.42]Here you go.
[326:24.60]No, I don't want to do two.
[326:26.48]Just one.
[326:33.11]What is that?
[326:33.63]Obsidian vase.
[326:37.17]I don't like getting the decorations.
[326:39.87]I'd rather you give me seeds or something useful.
[326:43.63]All this guy gives me is furniture and musical instruments.
[326:58.91]So what was next on that list?
[327:00.67]Oh shit, I need a gift, don't I?
[327:04.39]I have to give somebody a gift in like two days for Christmas.
[327:10.61]When is that?
[327:14.05]No, it's not for like another week.
[327:18.53]What kind of present should I give?
[327:23.42]I don't know.
[327:35.57]So you guys are saying I gotta repair the bus?
[327:39.39]Go to the desert or something?
[327:40.41]Does that have something to do with this?
[327:47.51]Out of order.
[327:48.01]I can swing harder now.
[328:00.87]Yeah, I want seeds.
[328:01.51]I don't want expensive furniture.
[328:03.13]Look, it's just gonna clutter up my house.
[328:07.52]Look at all this dumb shit I have over here.
[328:12.02]I don't want all this.
[328:14.52]What's the point of me having this?
[328:17.81]And now I'm about to add an obsidian vase to this whole equation.
[328:21.65]Look at it.
[328:21.93]This is going to be so out of place.
[328:24.55]Okay, cool.
[328:25.09]Hey, look.
[328:26.51]Nice.
[328:28.17]I'll put it in the kitchen so it'll look better.
[328:31.73]It's going to go right over here.
[328:36.62]Look at that.
[328:38.10]Wow, look at this.
[328:40.44]Cool.
[328:46.26]I'm putting the dog bowl out next to the other dog bowl.
[328:57.27]Why can't you put shit outside?
[328:58.37]I should be able to decorate the outside like I can decorate the inside.
[329:10.33]I just threw it in the fire.
[329:17.27]You think my bedroom is beautiful?
[329:20.07]The only thing cool in this bedroom is this.
[329:31.12]That sounded way cooler than I anticipated.
[329:46.13]You don't think I'm gonna answer, do I want your shit in my hands?
[329:49.35]No.
[329:50.81]Not really.
[329:56.80]What am I doing with all this crap?
[329:59.42]I'm thinking about just a spectacular bed.
[330:06.52]And then I've gone through all of my money.
[330:08.54]Is there anything else I can do with this money that I have?
[330:14.86]Or am I kind of just shit out of luck for a little while?
[330:20.72]Oh, no, I don't need these.
[330:21.56]I can sell them.
[330:28.23]A lot of crap that I don't even know what it does.
[330:56.51]What else can I throw in here?
[330:59.97]Amethyst.
[331:06.57]I think I'm just going to sell everything else.
[331:14.40]I'm selling every single thing in my inventory right now.
[331:25.09]Fucking everything.
[331:25.75]I don't even care.
[331:28.25]Buries the fish.
[331:30.03]Except for the chub.
[331:39.34]This is probably stuff is good.
[331:42.15]But I don't care.
[331:44.49]I'm sick of looking at it.
[331:46.07]And I want to make money.
[331:50.11]Can I give this to the little guy that's in that cave?
[332:16.80]My bed into the laptop.
[332:19.66]I already donated the helm, but can I... The dwarvish stuff, can I give that to the dwarf guy?
[332:24.40]So I've been told.
[332:27.65]Potentially.
[332:46.16]Bait.
[332:50.38]Fishing tackle.
[332:54.81]Okay, so this is the bait and this is a hook.
[332:58.57]I kind of like this one.
[332:59.59]Cling to your catch works best on slow... Never mind.
[333:07.42]Yeah, I'll just put that on and then... I'll just put that on too.
[333:11.54]I want more treasure chests.
[333:12.66]I don't care about the fish right now.
[333:29.45]I'm gonna sell this thing.
[333:30.33]Alright, I might need it somewhere.
[333:34.49]You never know when you're gonna fucking need something in a game like this.
[333:36.65]Alright, I need to prepare for spring.
[333:41.98]You know what that means.
[333:52.54]You just go over there.
[333:55.59]I need to consider what I'm going to do for an area.
[333:58.89]Maybe like a walkway down there that leads up to here.
[334:01.98]I can go up and down like this.
[334:07.72]I'll go cave fishing.
[334:08.62]That's a good idea.
[334:11.34]That is a good idea.
[334:17.26]I'll get some bait.
[334:22.43]Where's the bait?
[334:23.29]Bug meat.
[334:25.75]I thought I had like 10 or 20 bait.
[334:27.03]Don't I have it somewhere?
[334:30.57]Yeah, I got some right here.
[334:36.03]It's time to go fishing.
[334:38.70]We are gonna go fishing.
[334:40.66]I'm bringing the chocolate cake too just in case we get hungry.
[334:44.56]Alright.
[334:53.91]There's our fishing rod.
[335:01.63]Do you remember there's an up dog over in the trees?
[335:08.33]Always there?
[335:10.43]That's interesting.
[335:20.47]What are you guys talking about?
[335:21.29]You missed?
[335:21.79]You woke up and you missed?
[335:23.89]What are you missing?
[335:26.34]What are you guys aiming for?
[335:41.12]It was level 100, right?
[335:42.07]Let's give it a go.
[335:44.63]See if we can catch anything.
[335:49.81]I have bait on it.
[335:51.39]I've got the extra fish catcher.
[335:54.92]Good thing I caught a CD first try.
[336:10.52]Why would these things be attracting to the bait?
[336:19.01]Not looking so good so far.
[336:25.03]It's happening a lot quicker.
[336:26.39]That is one thing.
[336:27.83]This is happening most instantly when I throw it in.
[336:31.25]We're not wasting time.
[336:38.22]Come on.
[336:40.10]I got that one bite and it was just so erratic.
[337:03.95]Ugh.
[337:05.29]What's with the sodas in here?
[337:06.43]There's so many sodas in here.
[337:07.85]They're everywhere.
[337:15.22]What are the fish that are actually in here?
[337:17.04]What kind of fish are they?
[337:22.00]It was that one damn time that I didn't get what I... I gotta be super, extremely concentrated when I catch whatever the hell is in here.
[337:41.71]Lava eel.
[337:46.23]Now what's the... do they sell for a shitload?
[338:03.32]Well... We gave it a go.
[338:05.98]I'm getting plenty of these sodas.
[338:20.51]I gotta catch a bloodfish.
[338:22.67]Come on, I gotta get two bloodfishes.
[338:33.65]Fishing tackle is worn out.
[338:34.85]What, after like 20 times you can't do it anymore?
[338:43.60]Last couple times and that's it.
[338:49.95]Yes, I did pull an all-nighter.
[338:51.57]That is, yeah.
[338:52.15]I've been streaming since last night.
[338:55.47]Since pretty much like 11 o'clock or 10 o'clock or something.
[338:58.55]A happy 7 a.m.
[339:00.78]Good morning.
[339:09.92]I'm hoping to, before ending the stream, get through all of winter.
[339:12.80]And I'm not sure what's going to happen after that.
[339:23.96]Alright, this is it.
[339:25.50]After this, time to go.
[339:33.05]It's time to go.
[339:34.61]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[339:40.79]The cheese-eating Brit.
[339:43.92]Just subscribed.
[339:44.56]Where am I going?
[339:48.90]Thanks a lot.
[339:51.06]Welcome to the fam.
[339:54.01]Enjoy your stay, enjoy your solar system, eventual solar system.
[340:01.47]And eat that cheese.
[340:02.91]Cheese is good.
[340:05.75]Ooh, a book.
[340:10.76]This is the best spot to catch some high-quality trash.
[340:14.94]Yeah, it is.
[340:20.68]Am I going to continue streaming later on today?
[340:22.26]No.
[340:27.81]Whenever I end today is when I'm going to be done for the day.
[340:31.16]Because my real cutoff is, um, like, just about, like, five to seven hours is where I kind of have to stop.
[340:39.64]You know, I'll do it, like, once and throw the rest away.
[340:51.69]It's too long.
[340:52.85]I don't feel like making any more.
[341:03.73]Goodnight.
[341:07.77]Oh, look at this!
[341:12.07]My little candy friends are fixing the cart.
[341:23.20]That's a pretty penny.
[341:35.51]Get a little bit of extra energy.
[341:37.03]Because I slept a little too late last night.
[341:51.90]Jeremy Uranus.
[341:54.08]No, Jeremy Uranus is not... That would get me in trouble.
[342:04.66]My dog really hasn't moved.
[342:07.98]He's kind of just sitting here.
[342:11.06]You okay?
[342:14.35]He hasn't moved, right?
[342:15.79]He's been sitting here for like eight days.
[342:20.33]Come on, come over here.
[342:24.06]What are you doing?
[342:31.48]Where's my watering can?
[342:32.64]Give it to me.
[342:38.89]He's frozen solid.
[342:41.05]He's frozen.
[342:42.03]He's just like a statue.
[342:49.52]There you go, he's fine.
[342:54.70]Want a cake?
[342:57.80]Can't even give him a cake?
[343:08.12]Alright, now what... What is this key?
[343:14.33]Discover the purpose of the skull key.
[343:27.50]Oh shit, that was a chocolate cake.
[343:30.76]I forgot.
[343:33.44]I forgot it was chocolate.
[343:35.08]I thought it was just a velvety looking cake for a second.
[343:42.87]A new quest.
[343:44.01]I will love you forever if you bring me a crocus.
[343:48.45]No.
[343:59.11]Who's Abigail?
[343:59.87]She'll like a chocolate cake, right?
[344:06.68]Wait, is somebody saying go to the saloon?
[344:08.67]What's in the saloon?
[344:09.51]A second little video game or something?
[344:10.87]How do you open it?
[344:11.57]Twelve.
[344:20.57]What do you know, Grandpa?
[344:29.44]Where are you, Abigail?
[344:31.26]Which house do you live in?
[344:32.42]It's the Pierre's house, right?
[344:33.78]Yeah.
[344:40.09]I have a full chocolate cake for you.
[344:47.80]Hey, look what I got.
[344:51.32]I brought you a cake.
[344:54.92]Breakfast time?
[344:55.84]No, you don't want these, like, stupid pancakes.
[344:57.89]You want to eat a full chocolate cake.
[345:03.15]Three.
[345:03.91]We gained a heart, guys.
[345:09.94]we're we're making we're making our moves does he sell anything yet do I have to wait yeah I have to wait apparently he's gonna I'm gonna have a new
[345:57.49]Wait, that's it?
[345:58.23]It's like this tiny?
[345:59.83]Decorates the floor of one room.
[346:01.07]I thought it was going to be huge.
[346:04.92]I want a bubblegum floor.
[346:13.80]Whatever.
[346:16.70]What am I going to give my secret friend on the 25th?
[346:18.47]I don't know.
[346:26.50]Well, yeah, I know it goes in my room, but is it just a tiny square like that, or does it actually fill up the whole thing?
[346:40.48]Oh, that's ugly.
[346:42.70]That's real ugly.
[346:44.92]I'll take it.
[346:49.48]Oh, good, I live in a fucking cupcake house.
[346:51.72]Wonderful.
[346:55.64]What is this?
[346:55.96]Electricity?
[346:57.41]Oh my god, this is terrible.
[347:00.71]This is just awful.
[347:05.33]How bad is this?
[347:11.08]Why would you sell that pier?
[347:13.42]This just sucks.
[347:26.73]Oh, well.
[347:28.05]Thanks, Pierre.
[347:30.68]Can I put this over here?
[347:34.22]No, I can't go on the outside.
[347:35.22]Oh, here you go, Grandpa.
[347:37.54]You can use it somewhere.
[347:38.96]Can't even sell it.
[347:50.21]That is revolting.
[347:51.21]He didn't even drink his water.
[347:52.01]I think he's stuck.
[347:57.08]Alright, I rescued him.
[347:58.20]He can move now.
[348:02.64]He got scammed.
[348:06.81]Can I interact with these?
[348:07.53]Do these do anything?
[348:09.89]No.
[348:10.35]He's gonna stand there.
[348:14.55]Okay.
[348:18.23]Well, where is the winter bundle?
[348:19.99]I'm gonna look at that again.
[348:27.42]Okay, I already had a crystal fruit and a flower.
[348:29.26]I need a winter root and a snow yam.
[348:33.17]Time to go digging.
[348:39.19]There's the root.
[348:39.71]I need a yam.
[348:55.05]Go to the minecart too.
[348:55.95]Yeah, I want to get this done.
[348:59.04]Because I won't do it.
[349:00.88]I'll forget about it.
[349:04.57]Is there a certain spot I can get snow yams easier?
[349:07.91]Or just kind of you gotta get lucky from the ground?
[349:21.36]Took you a half an hour to find a snowy ammo.
[349:23.00]That's not encouraging news.
[349:25.03]I had one, but I sold it.
[349:26.23]Didn't think I was going to need it.
[349:31.21]Well, here's the mine cart.
[349:33.19]Oh, Geodude.
[349:45.36]Go to the beach.
[349:57.41]I got that from the trash.
[350:10.02]Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[350:13.38]Ah, the fresh champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[350:18.90]Dan Doodly Dee.
[350:21.59]Dan Doodly Dee.
[350:24.93]Welcome.
[350:25.45]Thanks for subbing.
[350:27.67]Appreciate it.
[350:28.13]I like your name, too.
[350:30.03]Dan Doodley.
[350:30.77]Reminds me of the name from last night.
[350:32.63]Toodle Dudes.
[350:33.49]Or, like, two nights ago.
[350:43.80]Oh, that was easy.
[350:44.38]I got that in two swings.
[351:00.46]Okay, well, I'm gonna go turn it in.
[351:07.33]Well, thanks for watching, Dan.
[351:15.67]DoodlyD.
[351:17.25]Danny DoodlyD.
[351:18.82]I'm gonna have fun saying your name for, like, the next ten minutes, by the way.
[351:24.80]Playing Hangman.
[351:40.02]Is this a Minecraft mixed with Animal Crossing?
[351:42.06]I would say it's not really Minecraft.
[351:47.54]It's more Harvest Moon than something like Minecraft.
[351:55.45]What is this bundle over here?
[352:13.41]Bundle complete.
[352:18.67]Okey-dokey.
[352:20.18]Ooh.
[352:22.10]Ooh!
[352:23.60]Winter seeds?
[352:24.96]Winter seeds?
[352:29.14]Do I have enough time to have these grow?
[352:30.68]It's like, what, six or seven days?
[352:39.75]Let's go do that.
[352:40.37]I'm gonna do that now.
[352:41.27]Go, go, go, go, go.
[352:48.93]First, I gotta do this.
[352:49.81]Where is it?
[352:50.13]Where the hell is it?
[352:54.31]Where is it?
[352:54.59]It's the Nautilus.
[352:56.39]There it is.
[352:57.50]It's golden, too.
[352:59.18]End the job.
[353:00.64]Okay.
[353:01.68]Go.
[353:02.06]Plant, plant, plant, plant, plant.
[353:03.10]Gotta plant, gotta plant.
[353:06.04]Is it too late?
[353:06.62]30?
[353:11.40]Should I... I mean, is it worth it?
[353:13.18]Should I just sell them?
[353:15.42]I feel like it's gonna be too late.
[353:20.70]How much do they sell for?
[353:21.48]Oh, look.
[353:30.39]Oh, really?
[353:30.67]Because I have 30.
[353:32.45]Will you go over there so I can sell these to you?
[353:38.67]Here, please.
[353:39.87]I want to see what it is worth.
[353:44.56]Keep them for next year?
[353:45.36]Yeah, I could do that.
[353:50.14]I just want to see how much I can get for them.
[353:52.00]Oh my god.
[353:53.02]I'll pretend to be you.
[353:55.81]Okay.
[353:58.63]What are you having?
[354:05.05]Use the speed, girl.
[354:08.34]No.
[354:08.40]It's probably not a good idea.
[354:11.98]Yeah, Pierre is literally shopping in his own store.
[354:15.92]What a moron.
[354:34.35]What can I even do right now?
[354:36.23]I guess I could go back to the... I could find Linus and give him another gift.
[354:41.91]What is like food?
[354:44.84]What do I have for food?
[354:47.88]Can I make some food?
[354:52.12]No, I don't have anything to make food.
[354:56.95]Wait, I don't have a cave carrot?
[355:00.38]I do.
[355:01.08]I'm gonna make him a cave soufflé.
[355:02.52]What the hell this was?
[355:04.24]Root platter.
[355:06.72]Alright, Linus.
[355:07.85]I made you dinner.
[355:09.07]I'm coming to give it to you.
[355:13.39]Yeah, there are five scarecrows in the fridge.
[355:15.05]Yes, there are.
[355:16.69]It's just an extra spot.
[355:19.01]It's extra space.
[355:26.84]It's just another place to put stuff.
[355:42.11]Linus?
[355:43.70]Here's dinner.
[355:46.90]I cooked it just for you.
[355:47.84]Hey, first I'm going to talk to you.
[355:49.78]Because that's what we do.
[355:50.42]We talk as friends.
[355:53.74]It can get really cold if you live in a tent.
[355:56.43]Yeah, I can imagine.
[355:57.25]That's why I'm going to bring you this delicious root platter.
[356:02.17]Oh my god.
[356:04.69]He likes us.
[356:07.68]We actually like we have a yellow light guys, you know that means drive as fast as you can.
[356:18.28]So excited about this.
[356:23.48]Great come stand next to the fire pit.
[356:24.66]It feels great.
[356:31.63]I was hoping you'd come by sometime.
[356:35.39]I'm thirsty.
[356:38.81]I wanted to say sorry for mistrusting you at first.
[356:41.51]It's alright.
[356:43.39]Most people don't treat me well, so I've learned to be cautious.
[356:48.59]But you've been uncommonly nice to me.
[356:50.68]You're a unique person.
[356:52.38]And I consider you a good friend.
[356:53.98]Yes, we made a friend!
[356:55.50]We made a friend!
[356:57.08]It only took us 26 hours to make one friend.
[357:02.25]I want to show you something.
[357:05.17]Hold on a second.
[357:08.77]Okay.
[357:11.38]Is this for real?
[357:20.30]Okay, I was going to say, this game is like rated.
[357:29.02]It's not...
[357:33.40]He makes faggots fish bait.
[357:35.90]It's fish bait.
[357:40.21]Top quality stuff.
[357:41.37]Here, I want you to have the recipe.
[357:47.17]Wild bait.
[357:51.73]Okay, well.
[357:54.74]Thanks for teaching me how to do bait, Linus.
[357:58.22]I guess we did something in this tent.
[358:07.56]He's my friend.
[358:08.50]He made me fish bait.
[358:09.97]He's a good guy.
[358:10.73]There it is.
[358:16.33]That's awesome.
[358:27.90]It doesn't take very much.
[358:29.76]I wonder how good it is.
[358:38.00]Can I talk to him again?
[358:40.16]After our bait sleepover we just had?
[358:42.06]I guess not.
[358:46.78]Well, I have a friend now.
[358:48.97]Me and Linus are good buddies.
[358:50.37]R-rated.
[358:57.99]Oh, man.
[359:11.82]I did give him my spicy eel.
[359:15.98]That is true.
[359:22.92]What a fun game.
[359:26.10]What a fun video game.
[359:38.67]I'm just kind of walking around aimlessly now.
[359:48.81]Game of the year confirmed already.
[359:50.37]You know, I mean, it is the middle of March.
[359:56.59]This is, as of right this second, the best game I've played this year.
[360:02.25]I would assume this is going to be on my probably favorite games of the year for 2016.
[360:09.44]Unless a bunch of crazy things come out out of nowhere.
[360:13.42]I would say this is probably some of the most fun I've had in 2016.
[360:17.84]It's only been a couple of months, but still, you know, it's very, very fun.
[360:31.05]Well, Overwatch, I mean, isn't technically out.
[360:35.89]I mean, I would still say Overwatch is one of the better games of, yeah.
[360:39.44]This and Overwatch are probably the two games that I would say, yeah, those are, 2016 games are really good.
[360:46.30]But obviously Dark Souls 3 comes out in like, what, two weeks?
[360:49.64]That's another one.
[360:51.54]Something else comes out.
[360:52.18]I need to go to bed.
[360:52.82]What the fuck am I doing?
[361:01.12]That made your weekend.
[361:02.14]That was very interesting.
[361:04.47]I forgot how ugly my house was.
[361:06.13]I was about to say, who did this?
[361:11.43]Oh, I gotta get up to the beginning.
[361:18.32]Okay, here we go.
[361:30.90]That's too much fun.
[361:34.71]Am I gonna play Enter the Gungeon?
[361:35.69]Yes.
[361:36.91]Absolutely.
[361:43.04]Fun is just a buzzword when you can't actually think of any real reasons of why the game is good.
[361:46.22]Don't use it.
[361:46.80]Either way, being amused or entertained while something... Being immersed is not the same thing.
[361:53.80]I... I mean, I don't know if you're quoting something or... But... I mean, this... There's no other way to describe... Like, what... How else do you describe enjoying something?
[362:09.21]I mean, could I break down every single reason why I like this game?
[362:11.95]It's just easier to say the game's fun.
[362:19.72]This has been extremely well polished.
[362:23.06]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[362:27.56]Linus the Master Baiter has subscribed.
[362:32.22]Well, thanks, Linus.
[362:35.55]We had some fun.
[362:36.67]Whoa, what's that?
[362:49.03]No, but thanks, Linus.
[362:51.29]Georgia Mart isn't even open.
[362:54.76]It's engaging fun versus unfun versus words and semantics.
[363:01.86]You really like arguing with semantics with people.
[363:06.48]Like the meanings of words to different people.
[363:12.57]When I think a game is fun, I just think it's fun.
[363:16.94]I have, like, reasons why, but it's just easy to say it.
[363:19.62]I could go off on, like, a 10-minute rant of why I like this game.
[363:24.46]Will you fucking open?
[363:26.59]No, wrong store.
[363:31.17]Saying a game's fun means you hate it.
[363:39.80]Ah, no rewards.
[363:51.60]Go to the saloon.
[363:52.64]I'll check this saloon out.
[363:53.38]I just want to take a look at this guy's inventory.
[363:56.76]Has he got anything new?
[363:59.09]No, he never does.
[363:59.67]I'm getting close to the 20... When is the 25th?
[364:24.53]I want to look at the calendar again just to make sure, because I need the perfect gift.
[364:28.31]It's in two days.
[364:31.35]What can I make?
[364:31.97]What can I do?
[364:32.43]Should I just bring like a carton of eggs or something?
[364:44.34]What do I do?
[364:48.60]Do you want this pie?
[364:50.10]Okay.
[364:51.22]Nine hundred.
[364:54.88]Yeah, if it was more like 2,000, I would have sold it, but I'll just save until next year.
[365:06.53]Go cuddle with Linus.
[365:09.33]I actually want to make the bait.
[365:12.93]But I need to figure out a present that doesn't suck.
[365:16.45]Oh, I'll go in the minecart.
[365:17.11]Good, good, good, good call.
[365:18.81]Good call.
[365:35.03]I'm gonna really piss this guy off.
[365:36.18]Oh, there are cookies in here!
[365:39.94]Hey, you want a cookie?
[365:42.96]Oh, it's so gross when I do it, but when I give you the cookies that were in the trash, everything's okay!
[365:50.69]That's hypocrisy if I don't say so myself.
[366:16.64]So I just get in.
[366:19.74]Choose destination.
[366:20.70]Mines.
[366:22.46]But, ooh.
[366:24.92]Okay, that's awesome.
[366:25.96]Town.
[366:26.64]Can I go to my own house?
[366:30.73]Oh, that's so odd.
[366:31.59]This is the best thing ever.
[366:33.77]I'm never gonna have to walk again.
[366:37.75]I'm never gonna have to walk ever again.
[366:42.81]That's incredible.
[366:45.07]Incredible.
[366:48.22]So what the fuck am I going to do for like two days?
[366:49.56]I guess I could... Should I make food?
[367:01.27]How, like... What is considered a good gift?
[367:05.33]Should I make her like a souffle or something?
[367:08.45]Should I go find out what she likes?
[367:09.47]I probably should do that.
[367:11.59]I'm sure it should be like... I like accordions.
[367:16.16]And I'll be like, you're... Yeah, I don't have... There's no such thing in that game.
[367:20.90]This game.
[367:27.96]Hey.
[367:29.22]How you doing, Linus?
[367:29.96]Thanks for not shunning me, Greg.
[367:32.36]It takes a lot of wisdom to override your base instincts.
[367:34.98]Four to ten.
[367:38.00]And... I'm going to give you an ancient drum.
[367:42.70]No, you're not going to like that.
[367:43.60]I don't have any food for you.
[367:44.88]I'll be back.
[367:52.80]No, it's a Marnu.
[367:54.26]What's her name?
[367:57.76]Can I just go up to her and just tell her that I'm her secret Santa?
[368:01.04]Is that kind of breaking the rules?
[368:05.72]Where does this person even live?
[368:09.27]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[368:16.95]El Pepperoni.
[368:20.80]Welcome back.
[368:22.30]Five months.
[368:25.16]Almost half a year.
[368:27.35]That's... I can't feel it.
[368:30.09]Five months.
[368:32.93]That's a very long time.
[368:33.89]And I haven't even been streaming... I mean, this last 30 days, I've been streaming a shitload, right?
[368:40.01]But four months ago, like five months ago, I was not.
[368:46.31]So that's very generous of you to be supporting the stream when there was no stream.
[368:55.69]But that has changed.
[368:57.24]We stream all the time now.
[369:07.56]Put these away.
[369:16.61]Let me see what I can make.
[369:17.55]Sashimi.
[369:26.61]Fried eggs.
[369:27.31]I don't really... Farmer's lunch.
[369:29.93]Cheeseburger.
[369:30.71]Dish of the sea.
[369:33.99]Roots platter.
[369:34.69]Can I even make hash browns?
[369:35.79]Here we go.
[369:39.03]How about this?
[369:39.47]No, I don't have milk.
[369:42.98]How do I make hash browns?
[369:49.99]Fuck.
[369:51.31]I don't have anything good.
[369:58.00]What about like a jewel or something?
[369:59.82]A diamond.
[370:01.22]You kidding me?
[370:03.00]A fucking diamond?
[370:05.06]You're going to get a diamond as a present.
[370:08.22]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[370:13.50]In Everfold.
[370:16.43]Thanks for the sub.
[370:17.75]Welcome, Everfold.
[370:20.03]Much love.
[370:22.39]Welcome to the stream.
[370:24.81]You're about to watch me give somebody a fucking diamond?
[370:29.65]If you don't like this, come on.
[370:32.87]I don't need it.
[370:33.33]I don't even need to wrap it.
[370:36.02]Gift wrap?
[370:36.54]No, screw that.
[370:37.18]I'm handing you a giant chunk of a diamond.
[370:41.81]Do I accept donations?
[370:43.51]I do not.
[370:45.57]I do not have a donation tip thing.
[370:52.86]Yeah, diamond it is, boys.
[370:54.98]Boys and girls, diamond it is.
[370:56.26]I have four of them, so.
[371:01.94]Is it just one present, or do you have to give more than one?
[371:10.31]I never fold.
[371:11.59]Ineverfold.
[371:13.03]What a dumbass I am.
[371:15.15]Wow, what a moron.
[371:17.45]Ineverfold.
[371:19.26]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[371:23.42]Eliobot.
[371:24.86]This is like three in a row.
[371:28.34]Thanks a lot.
[371:29.14]Welcome.
[371:30.82]I never fold in Eliobot.
[371:33.05]Ineverfold.
[371:36.91]What if I got it right?
[371:46.85]I feel like I haven't been using this.
[371:48.13]Should I be using this?
[371:51.62]Two o'clock.
[371:53.52]I kind of want to prepare... I need to prepare this land.
[371:55.70]And not, like, really this, but... I need to think about... Actually think.
[372:02.58]Break it down in my brain.
[372:04.28]And not just go like... Okay.
[372:08.30]Like, get it ready.
[372:11.24]Now I have to redo that.
[372:13.46]You know, I actually kind of like that.
[372:15.58]You know what?
[372:15.94]Yeah, actually...
[372:17.69]I kinda like this.
[372:18.23]I'm gonna go with this.
[372:22.01]Mwahaha, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[372:28.30]ZombieNegotiator77.
[372:29.50]ZombieNegotiator?
[372:31.98]You negotiate with zombies?
[372:33.62]Mwahaha, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[372:39.32]TonyKaku1.
[372:40.70]Both of you, ZombieNegotiator and TonyKaku1, thank you so much.
[372:44.05]Welcome.
[372:50.43]Uh, I can't do this yet, right?
[372:53.45]Somebody was yelling at me a lot, like, three days ago.
[372:57.43]Because I was just chopping down all my grass without a silo.
[373:01.09]And somebody in the chat was just like, oh my god, I'm gonna strangle you.
[373:05.37]And I was like, what?
[373:05.97]There's just grass everywhere.
[373:07.23]And now I get it.
[373:08.49]Now I understand.
[373:14.41]Now... Now I understand.
[373:18.96]Don't dig up the ground yet?
[373:19.96]I learned that the hard way.
[373:21.02]Oh, shit.
[373:21.44]Well, I already did it.
[373:25.94]I can fix it.
[373:29.56]Where's my pickaxe?
[373:30.38]I was about to have a heart attack.
[373:36.78]I was gonna say, where the hell is it?
[373:38.78]What happens if you get rid of it?
[373:39.56]Can you get a new one?
[373:42.04]I'll clean this up.
[373:55.05]There'll be plenty of grass.
[373:56.13]Okay.
[374:06.27]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[374:11.97]Panavala.
[374:14.01]Panavala with a sub.
[374:16.39]Welcome.
[374:17.70]Thank you.
[374:18.98]Thank you all you guys.
[374:19.74]This has been like five in a row now.
[374:23.35]Yikes, as they say.
[374:24.51]No, thanks.
[374:26.30]Enjoy your emotes.
[374:28.94]And welcome to the goddamn family.
[374:30.94]Um... I'm kind of at a loss to what the hell I need to do.
[374:43.80]The last, like, few days of winter, this, like, sucks.
[374:48.30]It's so cold and I have nothing to do.
[374:50.36]I guess I could go in the mine.
[374:53.31]Just go to bed, dude.
[374:54.95]Yeah, I'm just going to bed.
[374:56.51]Screw it.
[374:57.73]Time to go to sleep.
[375:11.96]Farm money at the beach?
[375:12.68]That's not a bad idea.
[375:15.06]That's not a bad idea.
[375:19.33]Why control over mouse and keyboard?
[375:21.21]That is a good question and I will answer it right now.
[375:24.74]When I do like long game sessions, my hand cramps up real bad and playing with a controller alleviates it a lot.
[375:38.82]Because, uh, I don't know, something about the way, like, my hand is on the mouse and click, click, click, click, click.
[375:43.14]I get bad, like, finger and wrist pain.
[375:46.97]Well, not bad.
[375:47.69]Don't get me wrong.
[375:48.15]It's not like, oh, shit, I can't even.
[375:49.83]No, it's just annoying.
[375:52.45]So, a game where I have to do a lot of click, click, click, click, click, click, clicking like this game requires.
[375:59.25]I, uh, rather do just do the controller.
[376:03.07]More comfortable in my hands.
[376:05.17]Now, a game like Overwatch or something, then obviously, yeah, I have that mouse and keyboard because you don't spam clicking on things.
[376:12.01]Alright, skeleton.
[376:13.89]I'm going to bed.
[376:23.32]What type of hand grip do I have?
[376:24.72]You mean for the mouse or for my... ...controller?
[376:30.95]Did somebody say spaghetti and meatballs?
[376:33.37]Did somebody order spaghetti meatballs?
[376:42.90]It really does look like spaghetti and meatballs.
[376:47.65]Good night, Spy Network.
[376:48.73]Thanks for coming out.
[376:56.83]Hey, tomorrow is the winter star.
[376:59.47]Did you get a gift for your secret Santa?
[377:02.69]I did.
[377:04.65]She's gonna love it.
[377:08.07]Yeah, you can hold the mouse button down too, but just even like the motion of needing to... I don't know.
[377:13.55]It's something about it, especially long sessions.
[377:17.88]I'm getting old, guys.
[377:25.53]I have crampy ass hands.
[377:28.33]So what, is it gold or diamond?
[377:31.25]What's the big ticket item for her?
[377:32.95]It's either gold or item.
[377:34.81]Gold, is she gonna be like really happy with gold or should I give her the diamond?
[377:41.15]Can I craft like a necklace or something?
[377:49.25]So just like a gold bar, she'd rather, you'd rather have a gold bar than a huge diamond?
[377:58.15]Well, if I can save the diamond, then maybe I'll just do the gold bar.
[378:04.84]Diver dirt.
[378:08.94]Hey, I got you some dirt.
[378:10.59]Do you like it?
[378:18.73]I'm gonna go to the mine.
[378:19.39]Just... See if I can get some more ore.
[378:23.58]Ore.
[378:34.75]She loves astronomy.
[378:40.63]Fucking closed on Wednesdays.
[378:41.73]You are always... Every time I want to get something, he's always closed.
[378:52.37]I don't get these books.
[378:55.49]Oh, the minecart.
[378:58.32]That's right.
[378:59.08]I forgot about the minecart.
[379:02.44]Hey, well, when you've been running for literally the entire game, it's going to take me a little while to remember I can do that.
[379:07.73]It's alright, I've got plenty of bugs to pick up.
[379:30.67]So can I do anything else here?
[379:34.49]Is that a 120?
[379:35.55]Can I do anything here?
[379:36.35]Or is this just... Congratulations, you found the key.
[379:41.84]Now do something else.
[379:47.38]Go to 100.
[379:47.62]110.
[379:47.64]Give me that gold.
[380:09.78]Place stairs there?
[380:10.52]Does that actually work?
[380:11.26]It would be crazy if that actually worked.
[380:28.31]Gonna move that stupid bobber out of the way.
[380:31.27]Make me select it over and over again.
[380:35.05]It's pissing me off.
[380:47.65]I just want to get more gold.
[380:51.18]Really?
[380:54.10]Well... Oh, it got hotfixed?
[380:58.65]Well.
[380:59.63]Oh well.
[381:02.13]Stop slouching?
[381:02.79]I have to!
[381:04.83]My back hurts, I have to.
[381:06.25]I have to, like... Well, I'm not slouching, I'm, like, leaning.
[381:09.28]Lean back.
[381:25.39]Get away from me.
[381:31.21]Get away from me, slimes.
[381:44.24]Ever have a dream that you were pissing and you start pissing in real life?
[381:46.82]Yes.
[381:47.04]I mean, that hasn't happened in like 15 years, but yeah.
[381:54.30]I've had the pee dream before.
[381:56.89]I mean, who hasn't?
[381:57.51]If you say no, then... I don't think I believe you.
[382:04.69]I'm worried that my toilet might be cold.
[382:06.13]Do you have any suggestions?
[382:07.29]Yeah, well, here's a suggestion.
[382:08.61]Yeah, of course I do.
[382:10.59]What you want to do is you want to wear jeans.
[382:12.97]And you want to sit on the toilet with your jeans on.
[382:16.09]For like, I don't know, two minutes.
[382:20.19]Then, your jeans, you know, you do the business.
[382:24.97]And that's it.
[382:25.83]It'll be nice and warm.
[382:29.41]40 minus 15 is 25.
[382:32.19]I was not 25.
[382:33.29]I was like 13.
[382:34.59]Yeah, then what you do, you want to just lay a large dump in your jeans.
[382:56.85]And get up, you've done it.
[382:58.03]I want to start seeing the... ...recipes that require the precious gems.
[383:16.94]Because I haven't seen any.
[383:19.18]Everything I need to do is all about gold bars, iron bars...
[383:24.66]Assuming that's going to change very shortly here into the next year.
[383:27.62]I think it's going to eat this thing.
[383:33.06]Eat the snow yam.
[383:36.47]This is such a... Oh my god, this is such a vulgar stream.
[383:40.23]Says the guy whose name is Anal Avenger.
[383:46.13]What a vulgar stream.
[383:47.44]I'm offended by this.
[383:50.12]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[383:54.93]Help me with this one.
[383:55.65]Belir Lifetalks?
[383:59.39]Belir Lifetalks.
[384:01.89]Thanks for subbing.
[384:02.47]Welcome.
[384:07.91]Very much appreciated.
[384:08.67]Welcome to the family.
[384:11.41]Please.
[384:12.47]Please welcome this new family member.
[384:15.59]With the presence of the goddamn moon.
[384:21.98]Let the moon flow through you.
[384:39.54]Let the moon guide your heart and fill your soul.
[384:56.97]Oh no!
[384:58.44]Whoa, whoa, easy, easy.
[384:59.33]I don't want to die down here.
[385:00.53]That would be a big mistake.
[385:04.01]Seeing as how I'm just trying to kill time.
[385:05.29]Not myself in the caves.
[385:19.78]Goodbye, bat.
[385:21.84]Time to go up.
[385:22.40]I'm done here.
[385:23.36]I don't want to die either.
[385:28.84]The moon family.
[385:29.76]Is this a cult?
[385:32.42]No.
[385:32.68]It's not.
[385:36.32]We're just friendly... men and women... that just happen to believe in the greater power of the moon.
[385:50.14]And its big brother, the sun.
[385:51.66]Okay.
[386:02.05]I'll deal with all this later.
[386:03.91]Just get this all out of here.
[386:04.87]Just give me my gold bar.
[386:09.41]Alright, it's bedtime.
[386:10.05]I'm going to bed.
[386:11.43]There we go.
[386:13.45]Let's go to the festival.
[386:14.21]I don't care.
[386:14.55]I'm done.
[386:14.93]Sleep.
[386:20.77]Santa!
[386:22.55]It's Santa Claus!
[386:23.11]Did you see that?
[386:24.39]There he goes!
[386:26.57]Come here!
[386:27.35]Did he drop a present?
[386:47.45]I have to do that every time.
[386:51.79]Santa!
[386:52.33]Okay, I have my gold bar.
[386:56.47]I'm ready to make somebody real happy.
[386:58.23]9 a.m., right?
[387:03.64]Can I just go there now?
[387:07.90]Nope.
[387:12.06]Of course not.
[387:18.00]What the hell am I going to do in the meantime?
[387:26.50]Anything I can do in the meantime?
[387:30.60]I'll watch TV.
[387:33.80]Living off the land.
[387:34.52]Another tip for y'all.
[387:38.73]Now listen up.
[387:42.53]Ever had the urge to dig around in your neighbor's trash?
[387:44.65]Ew, hey, if that's your thing, just don't do it when anyone's around.
[387:47.03]If they notice you, they'll be seriously grossed out and it'll harm your friendship.
[387:52.53]Good episode.
[387:54.75]Thanks, Farmer Bill, for telling me not to go in other people's trash cans.
[388:00.64]What a fantastic episode of that show.
[388:06.78]Hey, dog.
[388:16.89]Where's my fishing pole?
[388:17.63]I'm just gonna fish in my pond.
[388:21.27]Yeah, what kind of morons live in this district of television where you have to make that an episode?
[388:27.78]All the producers are sitting around and the writers are like, man, you know, we have this really big problem.
[388:32.20]All of our citizens are like eating trash out of the trash can.
[388:36.03]Can you make an episode dedicated to telling people not to do that?
[388:47.37]That was a long one.
[388:51.77]I thought that was the fish.
[388:56.40]Super Pilaxkin.
[388:58.04]Super Pilaxkin.
[389:01.22]Super Pilaxkin.
[389:02.56]Is that your name?
[389:03.28]I think it is.
[389:03.96]Thanks for subbing.
[389:04.50]I thought you were the fish.
[389:06.34]So I pulled it up.
[389:18.36]Yeah, that's where chairs go.
[389:19.06]They go on the table.
[389:20.80]Oh, it's starting.
[389:26.05]I'm joining this cult.
[389:29.85]It's not a cult.
[389:31.59]It's not a cult.
[389:37.30]It's a way of life.
[389:39.32]They're different.
[389:43.14]Okay, make sure I have the gold bar in my inventory.
[389:48.26]Okay, I'm not going to lie here.
[389:49.24]I don't even know what character Marnu is.
[389:51.12]So this is going to take a while.
[389:54.24]Because I don't know.
[389:54.82]Is it her?
[389:56.28]Yeah.
[389:56.70]Okay, that's her.
[390:00.69]Okay.
[390:02.11]I got something for you, Marnu.
[390:11.13]Give Marnu her secret gift.
[390:14.30]Here you go.
[390:16.00]Driftwood.
[390:17.86]Gold bar.
[390:20.60]So it's you, gold bar.
[390:31.62]Marnu.
[390:32.12]It's Maru.
[390:33.00]Maru.
[390:34.10]Why is it Marnu?
[390:37.12]The N is the R. The R and the U are together.
[390:39.78]Marnu.
[390:44.59]Okay, give me a break.
[390:45.69]I pulled an all-nighter.
[390:46.62]I've been up all night.
[390:48.28]Sometimes you add an N when you haven't slept.
[390:51.32]Sometimes an N gets in there.
[390:55.04]Oh, this is my secret Santa.
[391:00.20]What is it?
[391:01.64]Oh, I'm so excited.
[391:02.46]I can't wait to see what it is.
[391:03.50]I hope it's a sausage.
[391:06.32]What a fucking terrible gift.
[391:12.31]That was bad, Jody.
[391:14.45]Jody, that was real bad.
[391:17.27]You went to the beach 10 minutes ago and got me that.
[391:21.88]She freaked out and was like, I don't have a gift for him.
[391:24.40]She went to the beach and picked up a fucking shell and brought it.
[391:28.90]Okay.
[391:35.34]I'm such a terrible kid.
[391:36.88]You got me a fucking seashell.
[391:41.05]And typically you'd say it's the thought that counts, but just knowing that it was so easy for her to get that today.
[391:51.34]If she overheard me in a conversation talking about seashells, like, oh man, I love seashells, especially orange ones, I love them, they're so hard to find.
[391:58.91]No, I've never done that, and I never will do that.
[392:08.85]You're like the kid who cries when he gets a shitty gift so his parents take him to the store to buy him another gift.
[392:13.78]No!
[392:14.92]I'm just saying when this gold bar is being thrown around... At least give me two.
[392:23.29]I picked up two.
[392:37.84]That's so rude.
[392:55.02]What do you mean you're not welcome?
[392:59.00]Why wouldn't you be welcome?
[392:59.90]Of course you are.
[393:05.09]I joined, but I don't... You joined... Come eat!
[393:07.63]What's wrong with you?
[393:08.17]I hope she didn't see that.
[393:16.97]Yeah, don't look in the trash.
[393:23.02]Why does nobody like Linus?
[393:24.14]I don't understand.
[393:26.68]How do I get out of this?
[393:34.20]Okay.
[393:35.37]It was a wonderful evening.
[393:40.01]Where's Grandpa?
[393:40.63]I guess we can speed this up.
[393:45.54]Is the saloon open?
[393:54.84]Oh, he's all the way up here.
[393:55.60]Mm-hmm.
[394:04.57]Okay.
[394:05.45]Should I just walk away?
[394:12.16]Um... Everyone's kind of just creepily standing around.
[394:16.50]Okay, well, goodbye.
[394:21.58]Oh, what are you hoping to find under the spirit tree?
[394:24.80]Hold on a second.
[394:25.50]Yeah, I feel like this is important.
[394:31.28]A new watering can?
[394:33.54]Spiced mead or new boots?
[394:35.46]Well, I have really good boots.
[394:39.77]Is that gonna give me, like, the iridium water can?
[394:45.67]Jug of spiced mead.
[394:46.49]Give me the... I know I need a new watering can.
[394:48.41]I want a better one.
[394:49.07]I want the best one that I could possibly get, Mom.
[394:51.05]Okay.
[394:57.95]Where's my present?
[395:02.58]I don't understand.
[395:07.31]Alright, well fucking I'm outta here.
[395:08.51]I'm the Grinch.
[395:09.71]See ya.
[395:21.60]This was fun.
[395:23.33]Thanks guys, bye.
[395:29.48]Am I missing something here?
[395:30.62]Is people going to tell me that I should be over here, like, yelling, talking to somebody?
[395:34.75]You're not very fun.
[395:35.61]Well, no, everyone's just standing around.
[395:47.29]You have a right to be in a bad mood.
[395:48.47]You got a seashell for Christmas.
[395:50.26]Right?
[395:50.54]I know.
[395:54.36]That's what I was saying.
[396:00.04]I did talk to Grandpa.
[396:02.18]I guess I can just go.
[396:07.74]Goodbye.
[396:12.59]My house on fire?
[396:14.45]Oh my god.
[396:21.32]Good night.
[396:23.12]See you all in hell.
[396:36.39]Uh-oh.
[396:37.32]Yeah, I was going through the trash yesterday and I found my gift.
[396:44.96]Sorry about the short notice.
[396:45.92]Can you catch an albacore?
[396:47.06]No.
[396:48.08]Sorry.
[396:55.05]How many days are left?
[396:56.63]Two?
[396:57.09]Three?
[396:57.21]Okay.
[397:09.07]I need to go to town.
[397:10.31]I do have a giant flammable teddy bear standing in front of the fireplace.
[397:20.31]It's probably not the smartest thing.
[397:22.27]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[397:26.77]Spectag!
[397:27.55]Welcome to the family, Spectag.
[397:32.30]Thanks for subbing.
[397:37.14]That's a cool name.
[397:37.94]Spectag.
[397:39.79]Is that, like, spectacular, but, like, tagging?
[397:42.80]Spectag.
[397:44.30]Spectag.
[397:48.60]I don't want to do this either.
[397:49.40]I kind of just want to sleep until... Sleep until it's time to plant.
[397:57.49]Oh, it's Clint's birthday!
[398:05.22]I guess I could...
[398:10.23]What the hell am I gonna do?
[398:13.33]How do I get in the sewer?
[398:15.17]I'm gonna wait around and all this stuff down there.
[398:20.51]Oh!
[398:21.91]Look at this, guys!
[398:23.75]Hmm.
[398:25.81]Hmm.
[398:26.80]Oh, two!
[398:28.96]Oh, three!
[398:32.56]What a great gift.
[398:43.89]Yeah, I could get some cash.
[398:47.25]I'm going to get a bunch of fish and sell them.
[398:48.79]Maybe I can get a tuna.
[399:02.50]Yeah, I got three times the amount of Christmas presents she gave me.
[399:16.91]Like, even if she had spent more than five minutes on the beach, she would have, uh... Oh, there's an albacore.
[399:22.17]Okay.
[399:22.59]Well, I can give that to him now.
[399:25.45]Or maybe I can just sell it.
[399:26.93]We'll see what Willy says.
[399:45.00]Sardine.
[399:55.01]Sun versus the moon.
[399:58.07]They never fight.
[399:58.65]The sun and the moon work as one.
[400:03.91]Very important.
[400:09.74]They serve two extremely important purposes.
[400:12.20]20-inch herring.
[400:22.78]Cool.
[400:33.06]Did you just put an emote of the Sun and the Moon sword fighting or are they holding hands?
[400:36.68]I can't tell.
[400:38.65]That's either them fighting with swords or them holding hands.
[401:01.52]Holding hands, you monster.
[401:03.00]She has her trust.
[401:07.16]Got it.
[401:07.42]I hope there's money in here.
[401:19.15]Not bad.
[401:21.17]Not bad.
[401:29.99]Oh, that's tough.
[401:32.18]I think it's another tuna.
[401:35.30]It is.
[401:36.89]Same length as the last one.
[401:38.45]Bull crap.
[401:40.81]Bull shit is more like it, actually.
[402:00.80]You got a lot of goldfish.
[402:03.65]Hopefully these sell.
[402:09.49]Why do people like this game so much?
[402:10.61]I mean, what's so good about it?
[402:11.63]I'm not saying it's a bad game, though.
[402:13.01]I just want to know.
[402:16.26]It's just relaxing.
[402:19.02]And doesn't require... Will you get it?
[402:23.50]What the hell?
[402:25.08]Doesn't require you to... I mean, you can kind of just have it on the background.
[402:33.41]It's one of those background games where you just can chill and play it.
[402:45.23]And there's a ton to do.
[402:46.07]It's very zen.
[402:50.23]Lemon, that's a good way to put it.
[402:51.17]This game is very zen.
[403:08.13]A lot of goldfish.
[403:12.85]Not the actual goldfish.
[403:14.01]Golden fish.
[403:26.60]I don't think there's workshop support for it, but they're adding multiplayer soon, I guess, at some point.
[403:48.19]There's a ton to do, said the man who was fishing.
[403:51.57]Well, I could be in the mine.
[403:52.71]I could be talking to people.
[403:54.61]I could be giving people gifts.
[403:56.15]I could be going to my farm and getting it ready.
[403:57.97]Ooh, 22 inch mullet.
[404:10.00]Nice.
[404:20.83]Multiply might not be soon.
[404:22.40]It's developed by one person.
[404:24.96]Yeah, but eventually it'll be here.
[404:32.52]Eventually.
[404:32.92]You can do all this in real life.
[404:42.10]If in real life you actually have to bend over and plant plants and dirt, I can just pretend to do it here.
[405:03.67]Yeah, multiplayer would be awesome because somebody could be tending to the crops.
[405:07.83]Another person could be fishing.
[405:09.33]They could be in the mine.
[405:10.13]You could just work together.
[405:10.93]It'd be a very relaxing game to play with a buddy.
[405:13.69]Deciding on where you're going to plant things and being like in a voice channel with them and just hanging out.
[405:22.22]I would imagine it would be pretty fun.
[405:37.87]Yeah, real-life time takes too long, you're right.
[405:41.63]Lilkaza, that is a correct statement.
[405:44.59]I've caught like 25 fish in the amount of time that it would take me to set my rod up in real life.
[405:52.33]And then I'd fall asleep with the rod in the water, and maybe it would get something after six hours, and then I would go home.
[406:12.55]The end game is you have such a huge farm and so many crops you have to pick it all by hand by yourself Well, maybe like eventually he'll add You know because the game did just come out recently and I would assume an update to this game could be oh the machine update where you can drive around a little thing and it's can take up to four tiles in front of you and pick them up and harvest them or
[406:40.78]Something like that.
[406:41.32]I'm sure he's probably thinking of.
[406:43.36]Or he's probably thought of.
[406:45.32]But it is just one guy.
[406:58.53]That is something I've never figured out since starting.
[407:01.21]Do you have to have a wife?
[407:04.17]Or a husband?
[407:05.43]To have somebody help you on the farm?
[407:07.41]Or do your friends just come and help you?
[407:14.11]Actually, I need to donate this to the community center, I think.
[407:21.29]If you marry someone, they help you with farm stuff.
[407:23.83]I guess.
[407:25.25]That's, yeah, that's true.
[407:39.45]Come on.
[407:41.27]It's 4... I almost just said it.
[407:43.75]I wasn't even going for it.
[407:45.39]I wasn't even trying to make that reference.
[407:47.18]But I was just going to say what time it was.
[407:51.68]It's 440.
[407:51.98]There you go.
[407:53.98]Now I don't have to make the reference.
[407:58.78]Alright, this is going to be it.
[407:59.63]I'm going to go sell these fish.
[408:01.25]Hopefully have like a... No!
[408:03.93]I didn't want to pick that up.
[408:05.77]Now I have to do another one.
[408:11.43]You can have a son and he'll help you too.
[408:12.79]That's crazy.
[408:16.23]When does the fishing market close?
[408:19.60]Oh, shit.
[408:20.22]That answers my question.
[408:21.72]See ya.
[408:22.12]I'll just put him in the box.
[408:25.82]Grandpa will deal with it tomorrow.
[408:49.99]Interesting that there's this much stuff under here.
[409:03.79]Grandpa's dead.
[409:05.31]Well, the real grandpa in the game is dead.
[409:11.05]But fake grandpa is still very much alive.
[409:24.61]I've made some type of weird alien picture here.
[409:36.61]This looks like a mini map.
[409:40.60]I feel like if I press tab right now, that's what it's going to look like on my screen.
[409:56.25]Anything else?
[409:56.79]Come on.
[410:00.03]Give me some fucking expensive stuff.
[410:08.70]There we go.
[410:09.30]Some snow yams.
[410:10.26]Am I wasting my time here or can I actually sell this shit for a lot?
[410:26.02]If I get like 20 snow yams.
[410:27.38]I feel like it's gonna be worth it.
[410:33.76]Somehow.
[410:48.45]Yam value.
[410:50.73]Not that good.
[410:57.11]Well, I need to make it symmetrical, otherwise I'll lose my mind, so I'll just do this patch.
[411:08.95]Yeah, I kind of am just fucking up the beach, aren't I?
[411:10.69]It's got to be symmetrical.
[411:22.30]Has to be.
[411:24.62]Has to.
[411:28.63]Fuck up in front of this guy's house, too.
[411:34.42]You know what I mean?
[411:38.30]This guy's shack is smaller than the inside of Linus's tent.
[411:43.52]They might even be the same size.
[411:51.24]Alright, back to bed.
[411:57.20]So this is back to bed.
[411:59.00]Sell all these fish.
[412:01.34]And then I go to bathroom.
[412:07.53]And I think Otto might want a snack or something.
[412:09.49]He looks like he's kind of hungry.
[412:11.03]You want a snack?
[412:12.73]Hey, do you want a snack?
[412:16.49]That wasn't symmetrical.
[412:21.81]Wake up, pigs.
[412:24.25]Or cows.
[412:25.52]Whatever you are.
[412:38.34]11 p.m.
[412:41.30]What about under this snow?
[412:42.88]Is there anything that says, like, acorns and shit?
[412:45.73]Yeah, I think it's just acorns.
[412:50.57]Okie dokie.
[412:51.91]What's the word of the day today, apparently?
[412:55.95]Is that...
[413:04.49]I want money.
[413:07.27]Actually, give me that.
[413:14.34]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[413:19.58]Ratty.
[413:22.18]One of the rats.
[413:23.69]Thanks for subbing.
[413:28.05]Welcome to the family, dude.
[413:31.55]Uh, dog, you're gonna have to get out of the way.
[413:32.95]I can't get in bed.
[413:36.08]I can't get to the bed!
[413:36.86]The stupid skeleton and my dog just won't move.
[413:40.12]Okay, we're gonna move the skeleton.
[413:41.40]I don't want to wake my dog up.
[413:49.32]Cork bobber?
[413:50.61]Treasure hunter.
[413:55.73]But yeah, welcome.
[413:56.29]What are the rats?
[413:57.99]Ratty.
[414:03.23]That's a good amount of money.
[414:09.76]And I'm going to take a quick two to three minute break.
[414:15.51]I shall return.
[414:16.01]And we will continue to close out the winter.
[414:19.99]I'll be right back.
[417:50.83]Get in here, dog.
[417:55.17]Hey, little dog.
[417:57.53]Get in here, little dog.
[418:01.45]Come on.
[418:03.74]Hey, who's a good dog?
[418:07.84]Who's a little good dog?
[418:11.64]Was that a good little snack, Otto?
[418:17.76]Oil your door.
[418:21.00]It's a big door.
[418:27.92]I'm five seconds too late?
[418:29.10]Why?
[418:31.26]Why is that?
[418:36.83]I'll get my perfect old person food.
[418:40.31]I was eating it a few days ago.
[418:42.45]Macaroni salad.
[418:45.77]Perfect if you're an old 60-year-old fuck.
[418:49.27]Like me.
[418:52.81]okay I can put this in the the thing community center alright right I guess I have a lot of crap
[419:40.02]Greg's farm?
[419:40.62]Your old Greg's farm?
[419:42.10]That's funny.
[419:45.29]Must mute mic next time?
[419:46.63]Is that what you're saying?
[419:47.23]Wait, you don't want to hear, like, the odd noises?
[419:52.03]Like, the little clicks and clacks of my house?
[419:57.25]My dog, like, when he gets up and he goes, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.
[419:59.79]You don't want to hear that?
[420:07.24]Oh, that's the first apple I've seen in here.
[420:26.30]Tomorrow's the last day, right?
[420:36.05]Ooh, I can do that, can't I?
[420:40.27]There was an apple for the community bundle.
[420:44.13]Yes.
[420:48.71]Yes, quiet.
[420:49.99]Yes, quiet.
[420:51.07]I wanna eat this macaroni salad.
[420:56.09]Where's the autopilot in this game?
[421:03.99]Rusty spoon.
[421:06.66]That's an artifact?
[421:08.32]No, that's trash.
[421:12.39]Be careful when you touch that.
[421:13.33]You don't want to get tetanus.
[421:14.13]I need one of these purple mushrooms.
[421:32.80]I sold it a long time ago.
[421:38.34]That's sushi.
[421:38.74]That's kind of cool.
[421:52.79]The spoon the legends foretold.
[422:02.57]Where's this one?
[422:03.09]Is it up here?
[422:03.91]What's it called?
[422:04.41]What is it under?
[422:16.50]My fucking... Oh, there it is.
[422:25.91]I have honey, too.
[422:26.43]I can bring honey here.
[422:27.07]But I don't have anything else.
[422:32.67]Pomegranate?
[422:33.31]No.
[422:37.10]No.
[422:40.50]Jeremy, you're still playing?
[422:41.90]Yeah, I am.
[422:44.44]I want to get to the end of it.
[422:45.34]Once winter is over, then I will re-evaluate if I'm going to keep streaming.
[422:49.72]Or continue tomorrow.
[422:52.40]Or the next day or something.
[422:53.64]You know how it works.
[422:59.62]I'm going to donate the rusty spoon and break open this Geodude.
[423:04.38]And we'll go from there.
[423:20.77]Have I slept at all in the last 24 hours?
[423:22.37]Yeah.
[423:25.35]But, I mean... It's like...
[423:29.21]You know, with anything, if you stay up all night, even if you did sleep, you still feel a little odd.
[423:38.28]It never feels right.
[423:39.34]It always feels a little strange.
[423:57.20]Please process my stuff.
[424:05.03]Okay.
[424:07.17]I donated the first one I got for that, so that's a good one.
[424:09.93]I have that one.
[424:15.65]Give me a reward.
[424:16.51]I've donated a lot and I haven't really got much from you.
[424:20.01]Shit.
[424:21.61]How much stuff?
[424:21.97]I want to go look around.
[424:22.59]How much stuff is actually left that I haven't picked up?
[424:29.71]Quite a lot.
[424:33.69]There is a lot of stuff I don't have
[424:43.82]okay so these are the books that I picked up right secret of the star drop yeah I know I get you scarecrows I already know about it okay how deep do the mines go hold on this is important
[425:08.43]Where's the key go?
[425:09.05]Oh, and by the way, the key goes in the back of the shop underneath Pierre.
[425:10.79]Would've been nice.
[425:42.07]I don't care.
[425:46.32]Well, I know how deep the mine goes, but I want to know where the key goes.
[425:50.84]I got a skeleton key.
[425:58.52]Alright, back to bed.
[426:02.96]I'm done with winter.
[426:10.97]Oh, wait.
[426:11.39]Yeah, that's right.
[426:13.39]That's right.
[426:24.29]We told you a million times.
[426:25.71]It goes in the desert.
[426:26.71]Well, I've never been to the desert.
[426:33.86]You got anything you want me to do here?
[426:34.94]Oh, there they are.
[426:41.84]Journey of the Prairie King.
[426:43.06]I already beat this one.
[426:46.82]Do you get anything for doing it again?
[426:48.57]Is it like a high score or something?
[426:59.02]We'll find out.
[427:18.49]If I get the high score, do I get the... If I get the artifact that comes out of the bottom, out of the coin machine?
[427:29.04]Shotgun.
[427:34.02]Pretty sweet.
[427:35.32]Pretty sweet shotgun.
[427:42.25]Is this going forever?
[427:43.23]The French...
[427:46.41]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[427:50.13]Rock'em Sock'em.
[427:52.09]Like the robots.
[427:53.01]I used to love those things.
[427:56.53]Those are so broken though.
[427:58.31]They barely worked.
[428:00.93]Sometimes you get punched one time with a rock-em-sock-em robot, and you would punch your friend a hundred times and his head wouldn't pop off, but yours wouldn't one punch, because yours head was loose.
[428:12.47]And you'd say that, you'd be like, no, my head was loose!
[428:14.64]And he's like, yeah, right, fucking, okay, shut up.
[428:17.00]Yeah, right.
[428:18.36]And you're like telling the truth, but it didn't matter.
[428:20.68]Anyways, thanks for stopping.
[428:23.64]Welcome.
[428:24.96]Welcome to the family.
[428:26.34]Somebody hosted me too.
[428:27.50]I didn't really catch who it was.
[428:29.66]Somebody with the name 13.
[428:30.24]But thank you for the host.
[428:32.85]Whoever just started hosting me.
[428:40.57]Can I touch that?
[428:41.11]No.
[428:42.47]No.
[428:48.08]Ooh, coffee!
[428:49.82]Coffee!
[428:51.92]Get it!
[428:52.60]Yes!
[428:59.45]This is actually pretty fun.
[429:01.57]Like I said, it reminds me of Smash TV.
[429:04.47]What?!
[429:06.93]He did not touch me.
[429:08.81]That was dumb.
[429:15.36]Hit detection.
[429:15.96]Bullshit.
[429:31.15]Another host variable is hosting me.
[429:32.59]Thanks.
[429:32.85]A couple of hosts in a row.
[429:36.71]I appreciate it.
[429:37.23]Thanks.
[429:42.15]Yeah, how do you use the power-up?
[429:44.05]Because I'm using a controller.
[429:45.63]I don't know how.
[429:48.59]Oh, shit.
[429:49.09]I'm in trouble here.
[430:01.45]I don't want to get locked in the corner.
[430:02.59]I'm going to have to hit... Okay, I'm about to hit every single button on the controller and we'll see what happens.
[430:10.03]Well, not yet, because I'm safe.
[430:14.27]I don't know what these are.
[430:18.29]Okay, I'll take the boots.
[430:25.74]Can I take... What?
[430:29.76]Wait, what?
[430:30.98]What just happened?
[430:34.26]Space is item, but what the fuck is space on controller?
[430:36.24]What just- what did I just get?
[430:38.04]I thought that was part of- I thought that was in the game.
[430:39.74]That wasn't in game, that was... Okay.
[430:48.54]Man, I'm hitting every button on the controller.
[430:52.68]Okay.
[430:55.30]What did I get?
[431:02.41]I quit the game?
[431:03.67]How?
[431:07.28]Oh, it must have been like that.
[431:13.80]Well, I guess I can't... We're going itemless.
[431:16.49]Unless I can, like, mash space.
[431:20.77]No doing it again, guys.
[431:27.16]This time I'm not gonna get hit once.
[431:33.90]Quick, the game... I'm trying to figure out what the... Ooh, explosions!
[431:41.74]And it turns out it's not bound to anything.
[431:43.91]So, there's that.
[431:48.17]I'm gonna beat this whole fucking game.
[431:50.47]Just you watch.
[431:51.45]I'm gonna beat the whole damn game.
[431:55.51]Every level.
[431:58.17]Like, here we go.
[431:59.09]Okay.
[432:00.75]I just, like, reached over and hit space.
[432:06.24]So that works a little bit.
[432:16.25]How many levels are in this game?
[432:21.15]Oh, fuck.
[432:24.08]Hold on, I need a little bit of energy here.
[432:25.32]I'm gonna eat some macaroni salad real quick.
[432:47.32]Did you just say 800?
[432:48.10]There's 800 levels in this game?
[432:51.92]Okay, I'm not doing this anymore.
[433:13.43]Okay, we're good.
[433:13.91]There's no way there's fucking 800 levels in this game, no way.
[433:26.82]I refuse to believe that.
[433:27.66]It's probably like three.
[433:44.47]Okay, something's happening here.
[433:46.39]A button is being held.
[433:48.01]Um, I'm not do- Something's going on here!
[433:51.18]What the fuck?!
[433:53.44]I was per- Look it!
[433:54.28]I'm just permanently shooting to the right!
[433:56.16]What is happening?
[433:57.04]What button is going- What is being pressed?
[434:02.87]I'm not pressing anything.
[434:04.05]Is my, like, mouse over there?
[434:05.59]Give me the extra life.
[434:18.99]That was really stupid.
[434:19.87]Alright, we're back to normal now.
[434:37.29]Almost just lost.
[434:38.73]That was really close.
[434:39.67]I lost.
[434:41.71]Oh my god.
[434:51.10]I'm running out of time too.
[434:54.58]Alright, I think I'm too tired to play this game.
[434:58.07]My brain is like on drugs right now.
[435:10.00]Almost lost.
[435:12.54]Look, I can do the Donkey Kong Country one.
[435:14.42]I'm not like drunk enough to not beat this one.
[435:20.20]I'm like reading the chat and I fell off again.
[435:22.71]Get over there.
[435:31.41]This is actually hard.
[435:54.27]What's in this macaroni salad?
[435:58.64]Somebody put like hallucinogens in there.
[436:03.90]No, I'm just tired.
[436:04.62]I've been up all night.
[436:10.26]I pulled an all-nighter, guys.
[436:11.44]I got it.
[436:28.73]I'm going to get to the end.
[436:29.37]See, I'm almost at the end.
[436:36.78]I win!
[436:44.54]Mushrooms in it.
[436:45.30]No, I'm fine.
[436:52.24]I don't need to be jumping.
[436:53.15]I just realized that.
[436:53.85]I can just fall.
[436:56.49]They put you in such an odd spot.
[437:11.26]I might actually win.
[437:30.68]Fuck.
[437:37.97]Good night, Anthony.
[437:38.71]Thanks for coming out.
[437:42.67]Alright, this is the last level.
[437:43.77]This is definitely level 3, the hard one.
[437:49.03]Holy shit.
[437:51.00]How am I... What would I ever be able to do there?
[437:54.22]Besides just fall off.
[437:59.19]Okay, this is kind of ridiculous.
[438:01.75]How am I going to get up this?
[438:18.11]God damn it!
[438:18.99]Get me out of here.
[438:25.59]I'm too overtired to play these two.
[438:32.16]That's what I think about your fucking shitty arcade games over here.
[438:34.92]I was trying to slash him with the CD.
[438:44.61]I'm doing it again.
[438:45.31]One more try.
[438:52.35]Now that I understand what's going on.
[439:19.60]It's a lot easier now that I understand like what the fuck is going on and I can concentrate on it No, thanks a lot evil donut
[439:49.83]I'm glad you liked it.
[439:50.59]Oh, come on.
[440:04.82]I definitely caught that one.
[440:06.14]How are you supposed to do that if you get stuck there?
[440:09.02]How am I not getting on those?
[440:12.34]I don't understand that.
[440:17.08]Okay, well I have- I'm so- What the fuck?
[440:19.68]Did you see?
[440:20.72]I landed right on top of that!
[440:25.42]That was such dog- I'm gonna fuck outta here.
[440:30.91]That was absolutely outrageous.
[440:40.65]Stupid fucking 8-bit game.
[440:45.59]I'm playing the real game.
[440:53.02]The game where you fucking go to the farm.
[440:55.44]I'm going to bed.
[441:08.30]Back to bed.
[441:08.94]Didn't I?
[441:16.42]Wasn't there something I could give this guy?
[441:25.85]I don't think so.
[441:35.94]No, I'll beat that shit when I'm... haven't been away for fucking 24 hours.
[441:44.08]You'll see me win that.
[441:46.72]I'll come up clean, I'll go back to bed, and I'll be ready to play that game.
[442:02.79]I'm taking this fruit with me, too.
[442:04.17]Let's go to bed.
[442:06.20]I already have a lightning rod.
[442:11.60]I don't even need it.
[442:16.14]Nice excuse.
[442:16.97]Is that not an excuse?
[442:20.37]I've been streaming for, like, seven and a half hours, and I've been awake for, like... I don't even know.
[442:27.17]You want to call that excuse?
[442:28.07]You can.
[442:28.84]I'm gonna enjoy my macaroni salad for, like, until 7 a.m.
[442:51.22]Auto is better than you attack game probably is What else can I even do sure I just get to the end here sell this crap that I don't need I
[443:27.72]Where's my axe?
[443:59.27]If I place stuff, will it... I can actually grow it into the spring?
[444:26.23]Yeah, what is this, like, trash house?
[444:28.75]Whose house is this?
[444:30.07]Is this part of the thing?
[444:30.83]Is that, like, the coop that I can build?
[444:36.55]Get rid of this tree, and then I'm gonna... I'm literally going to bed.
[444:41.31]I'm going right to sleep.
[444:42.63]Alright.
[444:51.38]Is there anything else in the winter that I need to do?
[444:59.09]Uh, 69 wood.
[445:05.11]Linus's house.
[445:05.81]Oh, yeah, I'll talk to Linus.
[445:07.31]That's a good question.
[445:08.77]Good question.
[445:09.19]That's a good statement.
[445:15.47]Yeah, I think the stream is going to come to a close when I go to bed here.
[445:20.85]I'm running on empty at the moment, apparently.
[445:23.45]It really hit me in the last, like, 40 minutes, I guess.
[445:30.68]You should go see Linus.
[445:31.70]Yeah, that's a good question.
[445:54.14]Bring some wood.
[446:00.01]I want to catch a bunny.
[446:06.78]Oh, there is it.
[446:07.42]There is his hut.
[446:09.40]I'm going to bring him.
[446:10.20]Oh, shit.
[446:13.62]I'm just going to talk to him.
[446:20.88]This is tripping me up.
[446:21.64]My name is Linus and it's very rare that my name comes up in a game.
[446:28.25]Sleeping on the ground is good for my back.
[446:29.53]Yeah, it is.
[446:31.21]Four to ten.
[446:31.83]Do I have anything he might want?
[446:34.61]I don't think so.
[446:38.21]I don't think so.
[446:41.07]I'm just going to bed.
[446:43.19]I'm going to, uh... I'm going to bring him shit.
[446:52.49]Oh, no, I get... Yeah, crystal fruit.
[446:56.41]Here we go.
[447:01.77]Can we please see what tired Jerma is like at Overwatch?
[447:04.19]Oh, no.
[447:06.23]I can't.
[447:06.63]I wouldn't be able to comprehend that game right now.
[447:10.63]Did you see the minecart shit?
[447:12.59]You want me to play as, like, McCree?
[447:15.12]Against, like, good players or something?
[447:16.98]No, God.
[447:17.58]That would be embarrassing.
[447:29.73]Here, have a crystal fruit.
[447:34.08]This is a great gift.
[447:34.84]Thank you.
[447:35.28]You're very welcome.
[447:38.64]So what happens if you get people to... Do I get... This is really cool.
[447:41.90]The fact that when you get people to certain milestones, they do things for you.
[447:44.55]And they give you things.
[447:46.61]That's awesome.
[447:53.71]That's really, really cool.
[447:57.20]Alright, guys.
[447:59.17]I am going back to bed.
[448:00.37]And then Peter G. Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[448:05.87]Peter G. is going to subscribe.
[448:09.37]Thanks a lot, man.

[448:20.76]Check in here.
[448:27.66]Say hi to the dog.
[448:28.41]Hi, dog.
[448:30.46]Play a tune.
[448:31.10]Play a musical tune.
[448:37.00]And we're going to just... I want to see what happens when the year ends.
[448:39.96]So, year end.
[448:41.42]We're going.
[448:42.36]Go to bed.
[448:44.94]First year is complete.
[448:51.89]I'm assuming there's probably a cutscene.
[449:01.28]No cutscene, huh?
[449:06.17]Uh... I guess there is.
[449:08.79]What?
[449:09.05]I... This is all dirty!
[449:13.87]Oh, hey, Kent.
[449:17.33]Yeah, I'm the new farmer.
[449:20.89]So this is a new NPC, Kent.
[449:25.89]Okay.
[449:28.71]I am gonna leave this for the next stream.
[449:35.29]Oh, thanks, Peter.
[449:37.13]Thanks, Peter.
[449:42.30]Yeah, that's it.
[449:43.10]I am... You know when you have, like, a gas tank, and you're driving, and you're on E, and you get that low fuel warning?
[449:51.93]It's like, doon, doon, doon.
[449:53.31]You're like, oh, shit, I gotta get gas soon.
[449:55.73]Well, you didn't get gas.
[449:57.35]And you just kept driving on the highway.
[449:58.87]Okay.
[450:00.69]And your car started to, like, go... And you had to pull over and you were out.
[450:04.79]That's how I feel right now.
[450:07.09]So... I'm gonna... Go finish my macaroni salad in bed.
[450:13.69]And I'll probably stream... I don't know if I'm gonna stream today or tonight.
[450:20.17]But definitely tomorrow.
[450:22.73]We'll see.
[450:23.31]You know, I've... But yeah, thanks everyone for coming.
[450:30.27]Appreciate it.
[450:31.23]Much love.
[450:33.32]I'm going to bed.
[450:35.34]Have a good morning.
[450:36.22]Oh god, this is awful.
[450:37.72]What time is it right now?
[450:40.02]I need to see this.
[450:41.36]Oh god.
[450:42.06]It's 9am.
[450:46.14]What happened?
[450:49.63]It's 9 o'clock in the morning.
[450:54.65]Wow.
[450:54.89]Wow.
[450:56.30]Okay, well, I need to fix this.
[450:58.57]So, I'll figure that out tonight.
[451:00.75]Today.
[451:03.20]Take it easy, guys.
[451:03.96]I'll see you guys soon.
[451:07.52]And goodbye.
