[00:01.47]Jerma, why is pog not enabled?
[00:07.15]I want to be able to pog.
[00:10.01]I know.
[00:12.11]I'm not supposed to be here.
[00:12.89]It's been 50 seconds.
[00:15.46]We're going to let the intro play for a little bit, and I'll be right back.
[00:19.40]Pog, I'll be right back.
[00:58.84]I'll never have a real intro.
[01:01.04]I mean, this... Hold on, wait, wait.
[01:10.51]I mean, this is a real intro.
[01:14.25]But I have to go.
[01:15.75]I'm here.
[01:19.47]Yogi Bear for Jerma Rumble.
[01:23.21]Why?
[01:25.35]Why do you want Yogi Bear?
[01:31.95]Oh, I forgot to change after last night.
[01:34.33]I forgot to change the... I forgot to change the threshold for hype trains.
[01:41.05]I turned off the computer before doing it and I turned it on.
[01:45.00]Hype train!
[01:50.92]Okay, you guys have... No, I fucked it up.
[01:58.21]I forgot to change it.
[01:59.05]That's my bad.
[02:02.03]But thanks, everybody, for another hype train.
[02:07.72]Hype.
[02:08.20]Hype.
[02:08.96]Hype.
[02:10.50]Hype.
[02:11.64]EU-friendly.
[02:12.08]Yeah, that's right, today.
[02:13.78]Today and tomorrow.
[02:16.00]These streams are going to be shorter, but they're going to be earlier the next couple of days, today and then tomorrow.
[02:25.07]Community Content Day is tomorrow.
[02:29.15]And because it's been so long,
[02:33.44]because the I had a plan like you know I was going to go into the green screen again so I delayed the last one from December because there's probably a shitload of content I might break it up into two days not that far apart obviously but tomorrow but maybe we'll do part one and then maybe the weekend the weekend after do part two
[03:02.42]Just because I don't want to have a problem.
[03:04.30]Here's what I don't want to have happen.
[03:05.75]I don't want it to become like we're stuffing everything into one stream and I'm just skipping over content and trying to go as fast as I can because it's going to be like a seven and a half hour stream.
[03:16.67]You know what I'm saying?
[03:17.75]I'd rather like give time to people's work rather than quickly just, alright, that was that one.
[03:23.50]That was that one.
[03:23.96]That was that one.
[03:24.64]There's 7,000 pieces of artwork and go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[03:27.80]Thanks a lot.
[03:28.24]That was fun.
[03:29.93]What do you mean?
[03:30.59]What voice?
[03:31.75]What's wrong with my voice?
[03:34.29]What?
[03:36.95]Oh, my bitrate just dropped, though.
[03:38.17]Okay.
[03:41.45]Is that your voice?
[03:42.97]What?
[03:46.55]My bitrate just tanked.
[03:47.89]Did it just fuck everything up?
[03:52.31]Wait, hold on.
[03:56.62]It shouldn't be.
[03:57.28]It should be normal.
[03:58.14]It should be normal.
[04:00.56]Do I have a thing on?
[04:01.48]Hold on.
[04:02.86]Hello?
[04:03.96]No, this is... It should be... Does it sound normal?
[04:07.32]It should?
[04:09.38]I wonder why that's happening.
[04:10.30]Hold on.
[04:10.64]That's weird.
[04:13.21]That's weird.
[04:13.57]Hold on.
[04:13.77]Testing.
[04:25.09]Testing again.
[04:25.55]Testing again.
[04:26.25]Testing again.
[04:29.02]Does this sound different than... I can't tell.
[04:33.58]Scam level 4 incoming.
[04:36.24]Scam level 4.
[04:37.47]You sound like a robot.
[04:41.95]Do I have a... Yeah, this is weird.
[04:44.43]Hello?
[04:44.95]Hello?
[04:45.43]Oh, my fucking god.
[04:46.55]Didn't mean to do that.
[04:47.81]I think it's because I have this plugged in to here.
[04:49.62]Okay, let me know if this fixes it.
[05:09.64]Okay, I accidentally ripped out the power cord.
[05:13.88]I ripped out the power cable.
[05:16.76]Hold on a second.
[05:19.34]Is this any better?
[05:20.08]I didn't change anything from yesterday.
[05:26.03]Is it actually fixed?
[05:28.51]Huh.
[05:29.55]That's weird.
[05:31.89]I wonder why that happened.
[05:32.91]That's odd.
[05:37.11]Okay, sorry about that.
[05:38.13]I don't know why that happened.
[05:40.78]Give me one second
[06:08.55]Uh-oh.
[06:09.31]I lost audio.
[06:10.16]Somehow.
[06:11.04]Hold on.
[07:05.53]Okay.
[07:06.53]How does it sound now?
[07:08.01]Is it still messed up and crackly?
[07:11.51]I don't know why this is happening.
[07:15.78]Sounds okay.
[07:16.92]Well, hopefully I can hear this.
[07:23.34]Okay, I can.
[07:24.52]Hey, listen to that.
[07:25.30]Alright, I'm ready to go.
[07:32.64]Everything's fixed.
[07:33.94]Everything's good.
[07:37.04]Some of you might be familiar with that music.
[07:38.30]By the way, thanks for the hype train, everybody.
[07:41.34]But as I finish the, uh, the intro here.
[07:45.52]Uh, yeah, tonight, today, we're gonna do, we're gonna go for about four or five hours.
[07:51.05]Tomorrow, maybe like four, three, four, five, or something like that, under four, under five.
[08:12.02]Oh, there it is!
[08:12.64]It's a- hold on.
[08:15.79]I fucked it up.
[08:17.21]It's a little stretchy.
[08:18.07]It's a little stretchy.
[08:21.93]Ayy, it's okay.
[08:22.95]It can be a little stretchy.
[08:28.77]This game's a banger.
[08:29.53]That's what it is.
[08:30.19]That's what it is.
[08:32.23]Make the volume quiet.
[08:34.85]I don't think I wanna make the volume quiet on a music game.
[08:40.17]Can you, like, turn down the music in this music game?
[08:44.21]Alright, let's go.
[08:49.75]We got to level five.
[08:52.57]No fucking way.
[08:56.55]No fucking way.
[08:58.03]Scam complete.
[09:02.36]Scam level five.
[09:04.70]We're at scam level five.
[09:09.21]How would you like to label your save file?
[09:12.09]Uh... Grandma.
[09:14.55]Yes.
[09:19.75]I can't wait.
[09:20.29]I'm looking forward to this.
[09:20.95]Hello and welcome.
[09:25.24]We hope you'll enjoy Rhythm Heaven Fever.
[09:28.46]The game is both fun and very simple to play.
[09:38.90]being able to keep that rhythm going.
[09:40.96]You guys know me, I'm fucking good.
[09:42.58]Space Channel 5, done.
[09:46.88]Space Channel Bootleg Edition, done.
[09:52.68]Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero Man, done.
[09:56.21]I don't know how good your rhythm is to begin with, don't worry about it, I'm just gonna give 10 subs.
[10:07.78]We're at 10 subs.
[10:10.54]No, no, we're not at 10 subs.
[10:13.28]Hey guys, we just crossed 10 subs.
[10:18.14]You are quiet.
[10:18.98]I know, because I turned myself down because I want you to hear the fucking tunes.
[10:22.86]Alright, how do we do this?
[10:27.20]A. Are you ready to start the rhythm test?
[10:32.74]Press A in time with the signal.
[10:42.03]Not bad.
[10:45.37]Not bad.
[10:45.97]I just, what did I just do?
[10:59.17]I just made a stock market.
[11:02.39]If you have a lot of marks above the center line, it means you're pressing the button too early.
[11:10.90]Hold on, I'm all tangled up.
[11:14.30]Quick sell.
[11:15.42]Sell at the top.
[11:18.14]Try waiting a little longer.
[11:19.14]Alright, hold on.
[11:21.08]Do it again.
[11:21.76]Did I fail the tutorial?
[11:22.88]If most of your marks fell below the center line, that means your timing is a little late.
[11:27.45]I pray.
[11:28.19]Here I go a little quicker.
[11:34.45]Let's move on to our other rhythm test.
[11:38.82]Press A when the timer hits zero.
[11:44.37]Like, on zero.
[11:45.25]Okay, yep.
[11:45.73]People do this differently.
[11:47.69]When there's no... Wait, when there's no sound, try counting to yourself.
[11:51.23]Okay.
[12:00.30]Three.
[12:00.86]Seven.
[12:14.15]Alright, can I get the minor prize or the major prize?
[12:16.52]Oh shit, okay.
[12:41.17]five four three two one zero five five five four three two one zero seven six five four three two one zero
[12:57.01]seven six five four three two one zero seven six five four three two one zero seven six five four three two one zero done alright it was some of them were not great
[13:24.92]I like this so-called human music.
[13:27.54]If all your marks are close to the center line, that means you're good at maintaining the rhythm.
[13:31.92]I was.
[13:32.50]It was one that was wrong because I didn't realize it was changing up on me midway.
[13:37.09]Bow you.
[13:41.99]That's it for the rhythm test.
[13:45.10]I feel like I'm running an infomercial.
[13:47.26]I'm the guy directing the infomercial with the audience.
[14:07.90]Okay, guys, and when Ron Papil comes out, I want to make sure that you guys go nuts for him.
[14:14.21]Even though none of you have probably even heard his name before in your whole lives.
[14:17.61]Act like it's your savior.
[14:21.85]If we can in three, two, one, make it happen.
[14:25.09]Here he comes, Ron Papil!
[14:30.97]Nah, thanks a lot, guys.
[14:31.81]That's a lot of fucking money.
[14:35.09]A lot.
[14:36.95]And it happens every day.
[14:37.83]So thanks, that's fucking crazy.
[14:40.91]It's not important how well you did in the test.
[14:43.31]As long as you have fun, that's the main thing.
[14:45.21]That's exactly how I feel.
[14:48.31]So me and this game are gonna quit.
[14:50.47]We've got quite a few games in store for you.
[14:53.85]We hope you'll like improving your rhythm with them all.
[15:00.74]One more thing.
[15:02.80]In the test just now, you only had to press A. But some of the other games are a bit trickier.
[15:09.60]Sometimes you need to press A and B at the same time.
[15:13.98]Give it a try.
[15:17.56]Just squished his head.
[15:19.70]Yep, just like that.
[15:20.64]Remember what that feels like.
[15:24.32]You'll need it later.
[15:25.22]Alright, we won't keep you any longer.
[15:32.96]Alright.
[15:33.74]Level 1.
[15:34.72]Golf.
[15:37.24]All in one.
[15:38.82]You know what will really improve your golf game?
[15:41.88]Climbing your swings to music.
[15:44.42]Alright.
[15:48.38]All in one.
[15:49.46]Can we get a WarioWare intro to everything?
[15:57.12]Hi.
[15:57.44]Call me Monkey.
[15:59.64]Welcome to the first rhythm game.
[16:01.21]All in one.

[16:33.46]Nice job, alright.
[16:34.46]I get it.
[16:37.86]That actually looks like him.
[16:39.68]Let's try it with some rhythm.
[16:44.89]This is fun.
[16:46.01]This is gonna be hard.
[17:06.00]So, how was that?
[17:07.19]Much easier than before, right?
[17:11.15]Well.
[17:13.03]Hello.
[17:15.17]It's my friend, Mandrill.
[17:16.77]He's a Mandrill.
[17:18.94]Can I play too?
[17:19.74]Ouch.
[17:23.78]What?
[17:27.68]He's just throwing fucking balls at me.
[17:33.89]You can't do it like that, Mandrill It's hard to hit the ball if you just fling it with no warning Yes, it is You have to give a cue or something Alright, yeah, sorry about that I forgot it's your first time playing This time I'll give you a good cue Let's try again There, yeah, let's try it again This time Mandrill will make a noise as he throws the ball Okay

[18:48.74]Are you riding the rhythm?
[18:49.70]Feels good, huh?
[18:55.41]Alright, let's review.
[19:02.38]So Mandrill and I will switch off and toss balls at you, okay?
[19:07.76]Okay.
[19:14.05]This is like the best game ever.
[19:24.98]This is the best game ever.
[19:26.84]This might be the best game ever made.
[19:30.02]Close.
[19:32.39]Now let's do the real thing!
[19:33.73]Alright, I'm ready.
[19:37.99]This is the real thing.
[20:13.34]I wasn't ready for that.
[20:40.44]My God!

[21:10.69]So... I get it.
[21:21.83]There it is.
[21:23.97]Alright, figured it out.
[21:28.80]That was fun.
[21:31.99]Hey, even if you get some rocks thrown at you, you're fine.
[21:35.83]Even if you get a couple of ROCKS thrown at you.
[21:41.22]I mean, is somebody gonna throw a rock up there?
[21:45.76]What's the rock music?
[21:46.80]Somebody throw a ROCK at me!

[22:06.30]I just gave you kind of all of them.
[22:10.88]I say that all the time.
[22:11.99]I was just pulling out the ones that you've probably heard before from some of your favorite videos.
[22:17.99]If you're new to the channel, then you don't have any favorite videos.
[22:21.79]Um... What?

[23:05.04]Or you just want to take a break.
[23:08.51]If there's anything I can do to help, well, that's what I'm here for.
[23:11.43]I'm a little busy right now since I only just opened for the day.
[23:13.93]But we'll talk more later.
[23:15.39]I'm back soon.
[23:17.15]Read something.
[23:21.46]Rhythm test.
[23:22.50]Hold on.
[23:23.26]The microphone's in a stupid place.
[23:24.54]Give me a second.
[23:46.08]Anybody got a pair of pliers I can borrow?
[23:47.58]I need a pair of pliers.
[23:48.82]I talked to Barista.
[23:52.48]I've got some other customers to help.
[23:53.74]We'll talk later.
[24:05.83]Okay.
[24:08.05]A pair of pliers so I can tighten my microphone stand.
[24:14.83]Listen to music?
[24:15.55]I only have one song unlocked.
[24:16.99]Okay, yeah.
[24:21.51]This place looks packed.
[24:22.51]Alright, I don't need to take a break.
[24:25.58]Let's go.
[24:27.68]Screwbot Factory.
[24:30.76]Robot assembly is a precise task.
[24:33.36]Yo, I've heard this song before.
[24:35.58]Where's this from?
[24:38.36]Is this in anything else?
[24:40.18]Is this only in this game?
[24:41.86]I've heard this.
[24:43.32]You'll need to tighten the final screw just the right amount.
[24:48.12]Have I... Did I play this before?
[24:51.55]Have I played this?
[24:52.67]I think I've played this.
[24:56.03]No, I haven't.
[24:56.95]Have I?
[24:59.59]Welcome to the factory floor.
[25:00.71]This is where the magic happens.
[25:02.03]Or maybe it's in, like, Smash Bros.
[25:04.48]Okay, are there any of these songs in Smash Bros.? ?
[25:10.45]I feel like they would be, right?
[25:12.23]Your job will be to screw the robot's heads on.
[25:17.10]Hold A and B until the head is screwed on.
[25:18.96]Alright.
[25:19.36]I have to do it too.
[25:20.94]Please assemble these smaller robots too.
[25:25.02]Okay.
[25:39.65]This is fun.
[25:40.35]Let's go.
[25:40.85]That was kind of offbeat, though.
[25:45.99]Wait, did I say let's go because he said let's go?
[25:53.73]Probably.
[25:54.21]My brain, I'm so easily manipulatable.
[25:57.19]I'm the most easily manipulatable person you've ever met in your life.
[26:02.96]That's why the one guy exists.
[26:08.17]You can inception ideas in me, and I don't even have to be asleep.
[26:11.63]In fact, it would be harder if I was asleep.
[26:13.68]Of course it would, because I would be asleep.
[26:15.10]Movies aren't real.
[26:16.04]Okay.
[26:16.22]Here we go.
[26:22.77]Two, three.
[26:37.97]No, they're not.
[26:38.73]Yes.
[27:46.92]That's a perfect if I've ever seen one in my whole life.
[27:52.60]You finished the great robots well in the white robots past inspection.
[27:55.34]You got a superb.
[27:57.20]Is that a perfect?
[27:59.39]Wow, that's a perfect.
[28:06.03]Did I get?
[28:06.45]No, I didn't.
[28:07.61]Let's go.
[28:07.97]I thought that said, let's go.
[28:09.39]Perfect world.
[28:10.27]It's like, yeah, I got a perfect.
[28:15.17]I got scammed.
[28:15.85]Well, that means I didn't... No, there it is, right?
[28:19.51]No, it's a gold medal.
[28:21.35]You unlocked rhythm toys.
[28:22.59]Collect medals to play with more toys.
[28:27.98]Rhythm toys.
[28:30.86]Toy car?
[28:32.48]Police call.
[28:33.28]Alright, what's toy car?
[28:36.12]Oh shit, my battery in my Wiimote's low.
[28:39.86]Alright, I need more batteries.
[28:44.11]But don't worry because Wiimotes and the Wii is old technology and sometimes old technology is better than new technology because I don't have to plug this in to an outlet with like a mini USB cable.
[28:58.50]It's two AA batteries.
[29:00.70]Sometimes old technology is better than new technology.
[29:04.52]Hold back.
[29:05.04]Let's go.
[29:05.42]Let go.
[29:05.74]What could be simpler?
[29:11.03]Hold A to start.

[32:19.83]Alright, let's go with Weebo.
[32:23.45]Okay, this one is called Seesaw.
[32:28.92]Yeah, this like... It's definitely like Smash Bros Brawl or something.
[32:37.02]Seesaw inspectors are here doing important work to ensure the safety of our children.
[32:41.96]Serious business, you know.
[32:42.96]No shenanigans.
[32:52.55]You played this game in an old YouTube video.
[32:55.77]I don't know.
[32:56.57]I didn't, though.
[32:59.21]This is all new to me.
[33:01.02]Welcome to Playground Safety.
[33:03.08]We're going to inspect this seesaw.
[33:06.31]At the moment you land, press A. Which one am I?
[33:10.82]I'm just kidding.
[33:23.33]Looking good.
[33:23.89]Okay.
[33:24.61]Is it that simple?
[33:25.29]We'll be checking the inner part too.
[33:27.67]You won't go as high here, so it goes a little faster.
[33:29.96]Alright.
[33:47.40]Great, no problems with the inner part.
[33:49.01]Now, we'll keep checking, though.
[33:50.63]You can never be too safe.
[33:53.03]There we go.
[33:57.14]I'm gonna like this song.
[33:57.90]This is gonna be my favorite song.
[34:24.60]This one's a little late.
[34:26.56]Boom!
[34:56.50]Too high, too high!
[35:30.82]Oh, they're doing the air guitar.
[35:32.68]That's awesome.
[35:34.42]They're both dead.
[35:35.72]Okay, that's kind of sad.
[35:37.24]That's kind of morbid.
[35:38.42]They both died at the end.
[35:40.74]Those are some happy landings.
[35:42.83]And your high jumps were impressive.
[35:44.05]You got a medal.
[35:49.73]That's a good seesaw.
[35:51.77]That's a good seesaw.

[35:59.27]You unlocked endless games.
[36:00.52]See how far you can get.
[36:01.52]Oh, I don't think that's a good idea to do that right now.
[36:04.80]That's a bad idea to quit this.
[36:05.82]You know what I mean?
[36:12.49]Mr. Upbeat?
[36:14.15]Okay, Mr. Upbeat.

[39:57.11]I get it.
[40:03.65]Yep.
[40:09.34]It was a little early.
[40:19.52]You guys thought I was lying to you when I said that I used to... I'm serious.
[40:24.74]If there's a drum set somewhere, and I'm there, and you're there, and it's open drum night, I want you to hold me to this.
[40:33.97]I want you to say, Jeremy, go fucking prove it.
[40:37.57]That you know how to play the drums.
[40:40.21]And I'll be like, is that okay?

[41:35.46]I thought you said, thanks, I love you.
[41:40.04]Thanks, I love you.
[41:41.26]Well, I love you too, Mr. Beaver.
[41:48.68]Alright, see you later.

[43:57.04]It's okay.
[43:58.20]It's alright.
[43:58.68]It's okay.
[43:59.56]Don't worry about it.
[44:01.86]It's alright.
[44:08.02]Superb!
[44:08.86]It's like you were born to kick.
[44:12.61]Hey, thanks, video game.
[44:13.39]I've been waiting to want to tell you... Tell me what?
[44:16.60]That was just MonkaS.
[44:17.98]Right?
[44:18.16]That was an actual MonkaS.
[44:42.20]Is the game automatically saved by the way?
[44:45.72]Wait, I didn't unlock this one?
[44:48.00]How did I not unlock this?
[44:53.10]What is this?
[44:53.90]I didn't get it?
[44:59.00]Usually you unlock the one next to it.
[45:02.12]Alright, remix one.
[45:04.04]Battery is low, I know.
[45:06.00]I'm gonna have to take a minute.
[45:07.65]I'm not having to do this turn off in the middle of the game.
[45:10.63]Let's mix things up.
[45:11.39]This one's got a tropical vibe, like a musical vacation.
[45:14.11]There's no practice on this one.
[45:15.39]Sorry, buddy.
[45:16.81]That's what I thought it said.
[45:18.89]Sorry, buddy.
[45:23.74]Uh...
[45:29.86]You know, if I could set up this GoXLR to do, like, the remix, I would do it.
[45:34.20]I don't know how.
[45:35.02]And I'm probably never going to learn.
[45:37.42]Hello.
[45:38.54]This is where we mix up everything you've learned so far.
[45:41.78]It's easier if you just relax into the rhythm.
[45:44.40]Have fun.
[45:49.72]Ah!
[46:26.93]Ooh, that was faster.
[46:36.28]Oh man.

[46:44.02]Okay, she's seeing through the veil of bullshit that I did last time.
[46:53.95]Uh-oh, she just... She just heard about my political views.
[46:56.77]It's alright, kick the basketball back.
[46:58.79]I can do it.
[46:59.13]Alright, we're good.
[47:15.88]Eh, good enough.
[47:16.64]Let me do that one again.

[68:48.77]Fire.
[68:50.49]Uh-oh.
[68:53.53]Uh-oh.
[68:56.39]This is the thing people were warning me about.
[68:58.57]Monkey watch.
[69:01.36]This new watch works differently from most.
[69:03.46]You might want to read the manual to learn how to use it.
[69:16.38]1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4 Okay
[69:45.74]That's not so bad.
[69:47.26]The monkey watch manual.
[69:50.23]Some monkeys are on the off beats.
[69:52.41]Right?
[69:52.77]I got it.
[69:54.63]I got it.
[70:16.55]okay it's then I get it
[71:18.20]Oh my god!
[71:59.37]Good.
[72:03.41]What's going on?
[72:06.13]Oh.
[72:08.63]It kept time really well.
[72:09.41]I thought it was going to be in the dark.
[72:11.03]Superb.
[72:11.63]That wasn't so bad.
[72:16.15]This is without a doubt the cutest watch I've ever owned.
[72:20.62]Everyone was like, dude, Monkey Watch, it's going to fuck him up.
[72:23.78]He's going to freak out.
[72:24.86]That wasn't so bad.
[72:36.22]You were supposed to fail.
[72:44.98]Did they get increased in difficulty?
[72:46.52]I'm sure they do.
[72:47.58]Alright, here we go.
[72:48.20]Mix it up.
[72:54.67]They do.
[72:54.95]Alright, well, whatever.
[72:55.63]Let's go.
[72:55.91]Let's run.
[72:56.45]I'm gonna do it.
[73:00.58]Go practice.
[73:07.06]Fight!
[73:24.36]I thought you were gonna get this stream.
[73:34.21]I don't remember.
[73:35.07]What?
[73:56.18]Okay, that was a little rough.
[73:58.06]It's alright.
[73:58.64]Let me get superb on this one.
[74:00.77]That could have been better.
[74:01.53]I'll do it again.
[74:04.03]That was a fail.
[74:08.59]You played like a first level unhatched egg.
[74:13.72]That is such... That is such a... What an insult.
[74:19.84]A level one unhatched egg.
[74:27.27]If you get a Perfect on Seesaw right now, you'll receive a gift called Partners.

[77:56.35]Ah, I'm amazed that I'm still not sick of it.

[78:17.88]I fall on my bum way more.
[78:19.76]I'm sorry.

[78:48.00]What's the point of that?
[78:54.48]What's the point of that?
[78:58.11]It's just lore, okay.
[79:00.03]Oh, that was cool.
[79:01.29]Alright, let's go.
[79:03.57]Remix 2.

[81:52.90]That should be good enough.
[81:53.84]That's good enough.
[81:54.24]That's good enough.
[81:54.72]Rhythm League notes.
[81:58.85]That was great.

[82:01.11]Superb.
[82:01.55]You got a medal.
[82:06.13]You played like a 12th level golden rooster.
[82:10.83]That's not a very good Hearthstone rank.
[82:14.58]I'm not that satisfied with that one.
[82:29.07]So it's called Working Dough.
[82:30.61]Time to get to work.
[82:33.49]Follow your co-workers lead and move those thingies.
[82:36.19]Move those thingies.
[82:40.13]Working Dough.

[84:10.68]Thank you.
[84:13.84]He doesn't know Pepe left.
[84:16.55]What did I not know?
[84:17.81]Press A to jump and help me transport the thingies.
[84:21.31]Just watch and copy what I do.
[84:24.95]I love that clap top 40. yeah this community has exploded in the last year and a half
[84:50.23]So I hope that I can keep up.
[84:54.76]You know what I mean?
[84:55.26]I'm just going to keep doing what I've been doing for years and that I'm not going to change much.
[85:02.02]You know, I don't want to be like, wait a minute, this is a fucking lot more people here.
[85:05.65]This is a ton of money.
[85:07.23]I got to do something.
[85:07.81]I got to change.
[85:08.25]I got to do something different.
[85:09.71]I'm just going to keep doing it.
[85:10.55]You know what I'm saying?
[85:13.60]Good, just keep sucking at games.
[85:14.74]I just got perfect on first try on the fucking... on the seesaw.
[85:19.24]So the person that said that, I want you to mod that person for a week so they think.
[85:24.58]Holy shit, it's unmodded!
[85:26.32]And then after a week, IP ban them.
[85:30.73]You know what I'm saying?
[85:36.85]Alright, time for the heavy ones.
[85:38.47]A and B.
[85:46.34]This reminds me of an old Flash game.
[85:48.49]That's it, you're a natural.
[85:49.79]Alright, work hard and keep your chin up.
[85:51.75]I don't like the red light.
[85:53.01]Kinda hurts my head.
[86:26.85]Good commentary, Jeremy.
[86:28.05]No, I can't launch it back up.
[87:32.94]It's hard to press A like that.
[87:33.86]Uh oh, here comes the boss.
[88:04.41]There it is.
[88:07.42]Oh god, it's Reddit.
[88:08.78]What do you mean?
[88:09.48]Oh god, it's Reddit.
[88:13.14]Oh, Reddit.
[88:13.82]Okay, I see.
[88:14.68]It was the Reddit face.
[88:16.08]The Reddit mascot.
[88:16.78]What's the Reddit mascot's name?
[88:20.00]Quirky?
[88:21.40]Don't tell me.
[88:21.90]I'll get it.
[88:22.18]I'm not going to look at chat.
[88:22.88]It's like Quirky or something.
[88:25.91]Or like Quirk?
[88:27.03]Quirpo?
[88:29.84]It's something like that.
[88:33.56]It's, like, quirky.
[88:39.19]It's snoo.
[88:42.77]Is it really?
[88:44.31]Oh, I thought snoo was... People have tried to get me to say the word snoo in messages, and I just skip over it because I think it's something like that or something.
[89:04.43]Like, it doesn't... Wait, he actually said it.
[89:09.81]No, no, that's not right.
[89:11.36]Wait, what?
[89:13.82]Hold on.
[89:18.72]This is called built to scale.
[89:21.16]We got him.
[89:22.02]Well, you got him.
[89:23.96]Oh, this one looks cool.
[89:24.98]Welcome to your new factory job.
[89:27.49]First, we move the widget parts into position.
[89:30.25]Move the widget using A.
[89:38.24]I like when it becomes my turn, you know what I mean?
[89:42.18]What else is there?
[89:42.72]Let's probably move it forward?
[89:45.13]Backwards?
[89:58.44]Good.
[89:59.66]Next, we assemble the widget.
[90:01.82]Time it with the other parts, then press A and B. What do you mean?
[90:07.27]Press A to move and A and B to assemble.
[90:31.08]that feels nice great just like that please build a lot of widgets okay cool cool
[91:04.99]Yeah, I like to watch jermaOn 8-5.
[91:06.03]He's got a good stream.
[91:07.88]His stream goes cool.
[91:24.42]Slowing down.
[91:25.00]Nice.
[91:25.14]Uhhh.
[91:42.92]Gonna get real fast.
[91:49.36]Come on.
[91:58.71]I could do better than that.
[92:05.49]The entire commentary, this whole stream has just been...
[92:10.19]When you lose in a fighting game.
[92:13.45]And when you're at the screen where you lost and the opponent says three words.
[92:18.93]That's the whole screen.
[92:26.96]Piece of cake.
[92:30.22]You've got nothing on me.
[92:33.06]God.
[92:34.18]Try harder.
[92:35.90]That's all you've heard.
[92:38.33]That was so bad.
[92:43.31]Nothing like a job well done.
[92:45.12]That was four words.
[92:46.72]I love you?
[92:47.72]I don't think I've ever played a fighting game where after you lose, the person goes, I love you.
[93:02.91]Air rally.
[93:04.03]Keep the rally going in this badminton game.
[93:05.89]Try not to let the birdie go out of bounds, though.
[93:12.31]I love when it makes, like, the sound.
[93:16.95]You know, there's one thing that people impress... You know, I impress a lot of people by going... It's like, how the fuck did you do that?
[93:23.83]I go, learn.
[93:28.21]You know what I like when I'm flying badminton?
[93:32.06]Let me show you.
[93:32.54]Hit that birdie bat for me with A.
[93:35.18]1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[93:36.94]Let's go.
[93:38.00]Let's go.
[93:52.15]Illegal.
[93:53.09]That's a penalty for you.
[93:54.35]Good, that's it.
[93:55.71]I'm gonna change up the rhythm now.
[93:57.19]Of course you will.
[93:58.21]Listen for my signal.
[93:59.69]One, two.
[94:01.19]One, two, three, four.
[94:24.62]It's gonna be hard.
[94:25.20]Next, let's see how you do when I'm farther out.
[94:27.08]It's not going any further.
[94:30.54]It's the beat stays the same.
[94:34.26]Nice.
[94:52.59]Now for the real thing.
[94:53.49]At the same time, it just looks different.
[94:59.28]We gotta look higher.
[95:23.78]Stop counting!
[95:25.47]Stop counting!
[95:26.73]I just wanna listen to the beat!
[96:13.74]Stop doing that!
[96:15.46]What do you count?
[96:16.84]Start the whole thing over.
[96:18.80]I don't want any counting.
[96:20.06]Okay, so if I'm playing, if I'm doing a beat, if I'm like... 1, 2, 3, 4.
[96:24.85]1, 2, 3, 4.
[96:26.65]1, 2, 3, 4.
[96:26.77]1, 2, 3, 4.
[96:26.93]Stop doing that.
[96:27.63]I'm trying to hold beat, man.
[96:28.73]Here we go.
[96:38.45]It's like an old music instructor from the ninth grade.
[96:48.46]Here we go.
[96:52.13]No, skip practice.
[96:52.79]I already know this.
[97:06.65]fucking counting stop counting he's I can't do the counting when I hear two three four I freeze and I go what's happening two three four no there we go is there a way to restart faster
[98:11.38]The same scenario.
[99:08.35]Okay.
[99:13.55]What the fuck?
[99:14.79]What the fuck?
[99:15.67]How many times have I done?
[99:16.95]What the fuck?
[99:23.82]I go down to my lowest form when I need to dedicate my entire brainpower to something.
[99:33.06]If I was fixing a clock, if I had a watch and I had all the tools and I was really concentrating with the little gears, that's the same way.
[99:44.42]If somebody came to talk to me, if they were like, hey, Jeremy, what the fuck?
[99:50.12]That's all I would do.
[99:52.07]And then I would look back down and go back to work.
[99:54.75]I wouldn't be able to talk to that person.
[99:57.13]If you change any variables at all when I'm concentrating, you get like a one word statement and then I have to go back to what I was doing.
[100:03.72]Play Undertale again.
[100:04.78]Oh, I did play Undertale.
[100:08.20]Why did I say Undertale?
[100:08.92]Because of the music.
[100:10.34]It went like... It did that Undertale thing.
[100:15.42]Um, what do you mean?
[100:24.40]Listen.
[100:26.12]It goes... Watch it.
[100:33.19]I'm getting question marks, so I'll be quiet.
[100:36.32]Ready?
[100:37.12]Here it comes.
[100:41.12]And... See?
[100:41.68]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[100:42.94]You guys think I'm crazy?
[101:03.17]Alright, Figure Fighter.
[101:04.15]It's the latest in toy boxer technology.
[101:09.34]Try him out in the ring for a few rounds.
[101:11.30]You'll be the tiny inflatable champ in no time.
[101:15.56]LOL.
[101:16.52]LUL.
[101:17.49]Omega LUL.
[101:19.65]Omega LOL.
[101:21.29]Super Mega LOL.
[101:26.83]Hiya, I'm what you call a muscle doll.
[101:29.74]You'll notice right now I'm not so muscly.
[101:32.72]But check out what happens when you press A. It's like I get pumped and macho just for the second the button is pressed.
[101:46.00]That's cool.
[101:47.78]So I'm going to punch a bag and I need to be macho at the right times.
[101:51.57]Who comes up with this shit?
[101:52.65]This is so funny.
[101:54.13]Jab, jab, jab.
[101:57.40]Nice.
[101:57.66]Let's try the old 1-2.
[101:58.94]I love this.

[102:33.90]Ozzy and... What's his name?
[102:35.76]Rolf the Dog?
[102:36.32]He's on the piano.
[102:37.56]Yes, it is.
[103:00.32]Did you say that's from Phineas and Ferb?
[103:05.46]Fozzie Bear does that, like 30 years ago.
[103:11.68]Did they take that from the Muppets?
[103:14.63]That's how dare they.
[103:21.05]Go, go, go!
[103:24.37]Go, go, go!
[103:27.69]Go, go, go!

[104:47.26]Why not?
[104:47.74]I want to get it right.
[105:06.67]I have to do it right.
[105:08.88]That was going to be a fail.
[105:13.36]Wait.
[105:15.91]Okay, I thought I couldn't skip this.
[105:18.85]You would have gotten a great.
[105:19.97]I didn't deserve a great.
[105:23.24]You're supposed to fail.
[105:24.22]I won't reset.

[106:56.83]Fuck.
[106:57.07]Is this what you wanted?
[107:02.89]The fighter's got potential.
[107:08.21]That's the first non-metal.
[107:09.39]I have to get more.
[107:12.30]I'll get it this time.
[107:13.80]I gotta wear the itchy nose too.
[107:15.06]Look at that quality.
[107:21.72]Get a haircut.
[107:24.64]Why didn't you turn the face cam on?
[107:32.99]I wonder!
[107:43.56]Let's go.
[107:47.13]I'm ready.
[107:48.05]You're gonna see how I move when I'm doing tutorials.

[108:56.95]How was that wrong?
[108:59.41]Did I do it?
[109:00.49]Fuck.
[109:34.64]I had a water here, but I left it on the sidewalk, and people were, like, ashing cigarettes in it all day, so, I mean... I think it's still... Water is still water, though, isn't it?
[109:45.67]Oh, goddammit.
[109:46.77]I got a perfect, un-screwbot factory right now.
[109:51.03]Alright, I'll get it.
[110:07.42]Turn the light on in your room.
[110:08.44]No, then it'll be too bright for me and I'll get my headache.
[110:10.44]Alright, perfect.
[110:13.59]Perfect only.
[110:14.31]Stop waving your hair like a fucking weirdo.
[110:17.65]I know I'm on camera, that's why I'm doing it.
[110:19.03]I keep going like this because I know people don't like my hair.
[110:29.02]Stop!
[110:54.28]Can I still count?
[110:56.85]Can I still do it?
[110:57.37]Can I still do this or is it over?
[111:03.27]Okay.
[111:08.09]Alright, here we go.
[111:12.11]Relax, relax.
[111:48.34]Extreme Bits.
[111:49.26]Somebody gave 5,000 bits.
[111:53.78]$50 from Pissman.
[111:55.40]Pissman?
[111:56.02]What's his name?
[111:57.36]Pissman, yeah.
[111:59.62]Pissman, yeah.
[112:02.89]That's 5,000 bits.
[112:08.81]Hello, Mr. 985.
[112:10.01]Consider this my yearly germless subscription payment.
[112:14.21]I can't watch the streams, so I end up watching...
[112:44.59]I'm still using Streamlabs OBS, and they did an update today, and I fucking suck.
[112:49.98]And they made it so I can't read this now.
[112:52.20]It cuts it off.
[112:52.76]It's a mini feed.
[112:55.74]I never uninstalled Streamlabs OBS.
[113:02.91]Why would they get rid of it?
[113:03.81]I used to be able to look over here in my Streamlabs OBS, and it would just feed the message.
[113:10.85]Why did they get rid of it?
[113:18.78]Where is it?
[113:21.18]Use mustard.
[113:21.84]Alright, what does it say?
[113:23.64]Uh, consider this my yearly Jerma subscription payment.
[113:26.15]I usually can't watch the live stream, so I end up watching the vlog channel.
[113:28.75]Big up the stream archive.
[113:32.35]Alright, cool.
[113:33.55]While I eat and cry over my university assignments, but thank you for every stream.
[113:37.38]These streams make everything a bit more bearable.
[113:39.70]I look forward to watching this in a few days.
[113:42.06]Lots of love.
[113:42.92]Thank you.
[113:45.12]No one's ever expected to catch every stream.
[113:47.93]I know how it could be.
[113:50.05]You know, some of these streams get long.
[113:53.39]They go up to 6, 7, 8, 10 plus hours sometimes.
[113:58.85]That's why I can never expect anybody to do that.
[114:04.40]13.
[114:04.58]Especially playing Lord of the Rings.
[114:08.60]I have to get this.
[114:09.94]I don't care about the perfect.
[114:15.95]Turn a light on in your room.
[114:17.73]Fine.
[114:20.45]Eventually.
[114:21.91]He was doing better before he went on cam.
[114:24.09]Because I can, like, smell you guys, like, looking at me.
[114:34.89]Where's my lip balm?
[114:35.91]I don't think it's even in here anymore.
[114:43.30]What do you smell like?
[114:48.68]Go, go, go!
[115:15.47]Jab, jab, jab, jab, jab, go, go, go!
[115:20.41]And jab, jab, jab, jab, jab, jab, go, go, go!
[115:27.04]And jab, jab, one, two, go, go, go!
[115:32.44]One, two, and jab, jab, one, two, go, go, go!
[115:41.02]I don't know why I can't do this one.
[115:45.16]I don't know why I can't.
[115:47.46]It's like this light fucks with my head.
[115:50.20]It's like when it goes... Let's just close my eyes.
[116:02.45]I'm closing my eyes.
[116:03.63]I'm closing my eyes.
[116:04.49]Is that cheating?
[116:07.51]Is closing your eyes cheating?
[116:19.18]One, two.
[116:20.62]And jab, jab.
[116:22.50]One, two.
[116:24.16]One, two.
[116:25.80]One, two.
[116:27.24]And jab, jab, jab, jab, jab, jab.
[116:32.32]Go, go, go!
[116:33.10]And jab, jab, jab, jab, jab, jab.
[116:38.95]Go, go, go!
[116:39.75]And jab, jab, jab, jab, jab, jab.
[116:45.59]Go, go, go!
[116:46.35]And jab, jab.
[116:48.85]jab jab jab jab go go go and jab jab one two go go go one two and jab jab one two go go go one two and one two one two and jab jab
[117:10.51]Okay.
[117:42.75]Did I win?
[117:43.13]Nice combos.
[117:45.33]You nailed the last part.
[117:46.37]Superb!
[117:46.85]Finally, I got a medal.
[117:49.77]I was just feeling the music.
[117:53.75]I was listening to you.
[117:54.55]Alright, if you were to mute this, zoom in on my webcam, and put on, like, Beethoven's Symphony or something, it would probably match up.
[118:02.74]A tiny new world champion.
[118:04.18]That's me.
[118:04.58]Look at me.
[118:11.20]Remix 3.
[118:12.12]Let's mix things up.
[118:14.20]This one's got lyrics, because we realized we hadn't tried that one yet.
[118:22.34]Why does Dermot look like a school bully?
[118:23.88]I don't know.
[118:34.99]Go, go, go!
[118:45.52]one two one two
[119:15.58]I feel like I'm fighting a sneeze during a theater production.
[119:37.06]You don't want to be the guy that sneezes.
[119:51.72]Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.
[119:54.20]Go, go, go.
[119:55.56]One, two.
[120:08.49]Jeff.
[120:08.79]I'm fighting so hard.
[120:11.67]One, two.
[120:12.39]Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.
[120:14.98]One, two.
[120:19.25]Like, when Romeo and Juliet drink poison, you don't want to be the guy in the middle of the death scene to be like, Thank you!
[120:28.21]I didn't, how did I?
[120:38.92]Go, go, go!
[120:48.82]Spoilers.
[120:49.64]Yeah, spoilers for Romeo and Juliet.
[120:52.94]That's a 500-year-old piece of meaty- FUCK!
[121:11.80]Dude, I haven't seen Romeo and Juliet yet.
[121:13.83]They've just made it into a movie five times.
[121:16.01]It's been on Broadway for 700 years.
[121:18.63]Oh, and by the way, I read it in high school three times.
[121:28.64]But dude, it spoiled it for me.
[121:34.62]You did well enough to make your stage debut, but not good enough.
[121:44.36]Do it again.
[121:50.26]Boiled Gnomeo and Juliet.
[121:57.89]Alright, let's go.
[122:02.33]Good night.
[122:03.15]Go go go!
[122:14.92]What the fuck happened?
[122:16.80]Like, we both disconnected.
[122:19.50]One, two.
[122:20.16]One, two.
[122:41.02]That's... I know it's so easy for me to say that.
[122:44.56]One, two.
[122:46.04]One, two.
[122:51.25]One, two.
[122:51.67]One, two.
[123:18.41]Jeff.
[123:19.27]Jeff.
[123:20.11]Jeff.
[123:20.93]Jeff.
[123:22.57]Jeff.
[123:23.43]Go, go, go!
[123:24.80]One, two.
[123:37.73]Jeff.
[123:39.17]Jeff.
[123:40.09]One, two.
[123:41.65]Jeff.
[123:42.47]Jeff.
[123:43.31]Jeff.
[123:55.12]It's so hard to press A over and over again when your fucking fingers become covered in oil.
[124:00.06]I know that I am down, too simple to do.
[124:07.27]But hey, we'll act like two.
[124:09.97]But hey, we'll act like two.
[124:15.56]Yeah, yeah, go, go, go!
[124:18.06]Yeah, yeah, go, go, go!
[124:21.36]Yeah, yeah, go, go, go!
[124:25.57]It's disgusting.
[124:31.96]I'm covered in just water.
[124:34.74]Good enough?
[124:35.62]No.
[124:37.46]Oh, fucking come on.
[124:39.12]No, this is bad.
[124:40.08]Okay, in the original Wii mode...
[124:48.32]A button is this slick plastic.
[124:51.71]It's a slick coating.
[124:52.87]It should be gripped.
[125:12.92]Pain your controller?
[125:14.28]Gross.
[125:14.58]No, it's this really, really shiny, slick, plastic button.
[125:30.31]Go, go, go!
[125:31.97]Sip and cold on a big city night.
[125:39.01]Well, that's just how you found me way back then.
[125:43.14]Go, go, go!
[125:43.88]One, two.
[125:44.46]One, two.
[125:44.88]One, two.
[126:15.09]One, two.
[126:15.51]One, two.
[126:19.34]One, two.
[126:42.03]One two.
[126:42.41]One two.
[127:28.86]That's gotta be good enough.
[127:54.52]I don't know.
[127:54.84]I look like the guy that's at a party or that's at the wedding or that's at the club.
[128:00.19]Really, really, really wants to start dancing, but he's not going to.
[128:04.55]May have had like two or three drinks already.
[128:07.53]May be slightly inebriated.
[128:09.20]Just really feel the music, but no, I'm not there yet.
[128:19.99]I did it.
[128:20.59]Finally.
[128:21.81]You did well enough to headline a stadium concert.
[128:24.57]Well, look at that.
[128:26.33]Somebody redeemed a wink.
[128:32.89]When?
[128:35.60]Wink redeemed?
[128:36.76]Did we get a wink?
[128:38.32]We did.
[128:39.04]We did it.
[128:50.32]Yeah, I know, I make fucking strange faces.
[128:52.68]I know, I see it.
[128:53.40]Who redeemed the link?
[128:57.67]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[128:59.71]There has to be full camp.
[129:03.45]No, they can see my cord.
[129:11.08]Did nobody redeem that?
[129:20.44]I think I might have just got scammed.
[129:28.43]Hey look, it's everybody's favorite.
[129:30.23]It's everybody's favorite one.
[129:32.19]Live from ringside, we hear the champ's innermost thoughts and feelings after the match.
[129:37.10]Here comes everybody's favorite one.
[129:38.22]This is one that goes... Whoa, you got big guy!
[129:43.00]I've heard this one.
[129:43.84]This is the best song in the whole game.
[129:50.47]Thanks for agreeing to do a ringside interview.
[129:53.92]Let's rehearse a bit.
[129:54.92]No, it's like, whoa, you got big guy?
[129:58.74]It's hard to do.
[129:59.40]It's like, whoa, you got big guy?
[130:02.48]The voice is just, I think it's compression.
[130:07.21]Let's rehearse a bit before we go on camera.
[130:10.47]When I ask a question, press A to answer.
[130:31.16]Wow, your answers were so eloquent.
[130:34.90]Let's move on.
[130:37.48]If I say something like, you go big guy, in quotes, that's a good time to show off.
[130:43.57]Press A twice quickly to show us what you got.
[130:45.67]Press A twice.
[130:46.73]Here it comes.
[130:48.93]Whoa, you go.
[130:54.02]One.
[130:54.94]There it is.
[130:55.96]A twice.
[130:56.68]Oh, I get it, I get it.
[130:57.92]There it is.
[131:00.34]Whoa.
[131:00.72]One last thing.
[131:20.04]When the photographers are ready, they'll want you to strike a pose.
[131:24.39]Really flex those muscles.
[131:25.75]Press A and B together.
[131:28.09]Pose for the fans.
[131:29.15]Pretty good.
[131:32.71]Thanks for your time.
[131:33.73]Let's go.
[131:36.57]I'll see you after the match.
[131:52.24]Live from the Rhythm Arena.
[131:53.56]Oh, look at how sweaty he is.
[132:10.57]Whoa, you go, big guy.
[132:12.72]Whoa, you go, big guy.
[132:15.90]Whoa, you go, big guy.
[132:39.60]Is that true?
[132:40.82]Whoa, you go, big guy.

[133:30.02]Wrestler exudes confidence and wit, and wrestler poses impressively.
[133:35.35]Oh no, that one's over.
[133:38.01]No question or opponent is too tough for this guy.
[133:48.39]There's a lot of songs.
[133:49.37]How many songs are there?
[133:50.99]If you get perfect on Remix 2 right now, you'll get a gift.

[179:17.18]I love this sport.
[179:21.06]Let's take a look.
[179:24.97]Baseball.
[179:26.96]Let's practice before our big exhibition match.
[179:29.80]All you have to do is hit the ball when I pitch it.
[179:33.16]You might want to count to yourself to get the timing right.
[179:36.73]Wait.
[179:37.55]What?
[179:37.73]What kind of base... I thought it was going to be fast.
[179:58.32]Ow, my face.
[180:00.74]Alright, get to the real match.
[180:06.32]Oh, by the way, there are no cues in the real thing.
[180:10.43]Of course they're not.
[180:49.17]I'm already looking at you like that.
[180:51.41]Oh, that's...
[181:29.56]Never found the time, time, time
[182:01.31]Did I do it?
[182:13.74]Monkey umpire's call.
[182:15.02]You had a nice solid swing there and you hit even with audio cues.
[182:20.82]Monkey was behind it the whole time.
[182:24.22]You won't see that one again.
[182:28.90]Almost perfect.
[182:29.38]Yeah, I missed one.
[182:33.14]That was cool.

[182:37.52]It's amazing to see so many birds migrating together.
[182:39.94]Of course, to avoid stepping on each other's toes, they'll need good rhythm.
[182:45.72]Alright.
[182:48.97]Cool.
[182:49.69]Yes, yes, yes.
[182:50.49]Walk, step.
[182:51.05]Is this a pretty popular one, it seems, from the audience?

[182:57.99]No, I've seen this song.
[183:00.82]With the birds.

[183:30.23]Hold A and B to get ready, then release to jump.
[184:01.70]That's it.
[184:02.68]Okay, let's go.

[221:56.08]I'll take you back to your youth unless you're still there.
[222:28.42]That's pretty good.
[222:30.71]Remix six.
[222:39.15]No practice.
[222:40.51]Oh, it starts off with this.
[222:41.55]Photoshop, Photoshop.
[222:47.22]Into you.
[222:48.20]Into you.
[222:50.30]Into you.
[222:50.88]One, two, do, do, do, dum, dum.
[222:59.57]into you, into you, into you, into you, into you, into you, into you, into you, into you, into you, into you, into you, into you, into you, into you, into you,
[223:30.56]into you into you into you into you into you into you
[223:56.86]I got timing wrong.
[224:31.23]Okay.
[224:33.11]I fucked it up.
[224:33.57]It's okay.
[224:34.25]That was tricky.
[224:36.78]That was a train wreck.
[224:37.72]Well, I mean... You gotta see it once or twice before you know when things are happening.
[224:42.64]If your skill was a business trip, you'd miss a meeting down the hall.
[224:45.82]Pepe left hairline.
[224:51.92]What about it?
[224:57.60]I think it looks pretty good!
[225:07.20]I'll be 30 goddamn 5 in 2020.
[225:13.19]This is looking pretty good for 3-5.
[225:17.27]Now excuse me, I've got some Donk Donks to take care of.
[225:31.51]into you, into you, into you, into you.
[225:34.39]Crazy into you.
[225:35.31]Crazy into you.
[225:36.81]Crazy into you.
[225:38.35]Crazy into you.
[225:40.15]Crazy into you.
[225:44.55]Crazy into you.
[225:46.13]Crazy into you.
[225:47.85]Crazy into you.
[225:49.41]Crazy into you.
[226:02.49]into you into you into you
[226:31.52]I can
[227:15.60]If you get a purpose on Remix 4 right now, you'll- No, I can't throw that.
[227:24.92]I'm trying to do Remix 6.
[227:31.94]You are the mule.
[227:33.30]Booger-faced Billy.
[227:36.28]Alright.
[227:41.72]I hate you.
[227:43.07]I'm just going to piss my pants.
[227:44.91]I'm going to go.
[228:20.87]Into you.
[228:51.97]Don't fuck with me!
[229:34.60]Nailed it.
[229:35.50]That didn't get okay.
[229:36.26]I don't have any rhythm.
[229:41.94]Something that I think a lot of people are misunderstanding when I do the remix is it's hard to have rhythm when you have to play seven different songs that intercut into each other.
[229:53.13]That's like if you have a guitarist that's on stage and he's playing song one and then in the middle of the song the lead singer goes
[230:03.05]Song!
[230:04.03]Fourth song on the album!
[230:05.39]And that's why we... And he's just like, what the fuck is happening?
[230:07.79]Why are you doing this?
[230:08.87]Okay, we're gonna go song four on the album.
[230:12.60]You don't... It's mid-song!
[230:21.12]How are you supposed to do that?
[230:31.84]Sorry, you're bad at remixes, Jeremy.
[230:34.84]I just got a gold star on that one.
[230:36.32]It's called Medley.
[230:42.96]This is like... This is fucking WarioWare games.
[230:46.92]This is not like me having a guitar in my hand.
[230:51.51]Yeah, you know, I just don't think he has very much medley.
[230:54.59]Playing the WarioWare micro games that go... 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, GO!
[231:03.00]Alright, here we go.
[231:03.72]This is called tap fruit.
[231:08.60]With taps on their shoes and boxes on their heads.
[231:11.52]This quartet of dream is stardom.
[231:13.22]We understand the taps, but the head boxes?
[231:15.04]Time to tap.
[231:30.66]Let's start with the basics, stepping in sync with one another.
[231:32.57]One, two, one, two, three, four.
[231:59.64]Okay, so that's pretty simple.
[232:01.63]Let's try mixing up the rhythm slightly.
[232:03.95]Listen closely to the rhythm.
[232:04.95]Switch patterns on ready.
[232:08.16]One, two, three.
[233:00.41]Okay.
[233:01.98]Let's try that again, but a bit shorter this time.
[233:04.00]Alright.
[233:05.52]Let's try it.
[233:07.07]Okay.
[233:36.51]And shorter.
[233:38.17]Oh, Lord.
[233:39.00]Not bad.
[233:40.10]That's it.
[233:41.16]I think we're ready.
[233:43.44]Are we?
[233:44.18]Alright.
[233:44.70]Showtime.
[233:45.42]Everybody break a leg.
[234:06.27]I wasn't ready.
[234:15.25]I wasn't ready.
[234:18.55]I wasn't ready.
[234:19.03]I wasn't ready.
[234:19.51]I wasn't ready.
[234:22.55]I was thinking about how I have to go to the bathroom.
[234:23.91]I have to go to the bathroom.
[234:26.03]I gotta go to the bathroom.
[234:29.97]Hold on.
[234:36.57]One, two, one, two, three, four, tap.
[234:42.82]Ready and bomb, bomb, bomb, tap, tap, tap.
[234:47.86]OK.
[234:53.54]Ready and tap, tap, tap.
[234:56.37]OK.
[235:00.55]Ready and bomb, bomb, bomb.
[235:21.32]This one's good.
[235:22.00]This one's easy.
[235:23.75]Didn't expect that to be long.
[235:54.02]Beat and tap.
[236:23.40]Hey, what?
[236:24.00]You didn't put my leg back.
[236:25.45]Oh, now I'm out of steps.
[236:26.17]He didn't put his leg back.
[236:28.41]He didn't put his leg back.
[236:33.41]He didn't, like, put his leg back.
[236:35.85]Oh, they're huge.
[236:39.56]Friendly feedback.
[236:41.06]Eh, good enough.
[236:41.92]I gotta pee.
[236:44.80]We're back.
[239:52.59]This is an awesome song.
[239:56.43]We did it, didn't we?
[239:57.29]Alright, let me get this off.
[240:01.39]Okay.
[240:06.35]I can do that one better.
[240:09.13]I can do that one better.
[240:09.95]Bum bum bum bum bum bum.
[240:21.75]Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[240:24.44]One, two, three, four.
[240:51.48]You know what?
[240:53.00]Why don't they make a party game like this?
[240:56.60]Online multiplayer.
[240:57.38]Wouldn't that be fuckin' awesome?
[241:00.94]And everybody's on the screen?
[241:05.76]That'd be amazing!
[242:20.05]Got it.
[242:20.29]Okay, that should be good.
[242:21.71]Nice fail, nerd.
[242:25.85]I respect your opinion, and I respect you being mean to me.
[242:30.29]But I'm not gonna take it.
[242:33.07]Get him out of here.
[242:34.69]Alright.
[242:35.31]Uh, still okay.
[242:36.19]What?
[242:36.39]I only messed up once.
[242:37.45]I messed up one time.
[242:40.57]That was that bad?
[242:41.53]No, it wasn't.
[242:43.68]Shrimp shuffle.
[242:45.58]Shrimp makes surprisingly good dancers and will jump at the chance to show off his skills.
[242:49.46]Try not to bump into anyone.
[242:52.48]Shrimp.
[242:54.46]Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no.
[242:56.36]I mean, oh no.
[243:01.91]What's wrong with this?
[243:04.63]There's a seizure warning here?
[243:08.05]Is there?
[243:10.31]Where the shrimp is?
[243:11.87]Camper is a low tide dance troupe.
[243:16.48]Take a deep breath.
[243:17.22]Wait.
[243:21.19]Is it actually, like, a seizure warning here?
[243:24.21]We specialize in synchronized dancing like a chorus line.
[243:28.47]You know what?
[243:29.34]Let's just show you.

[245:37.38]What are you on?
[245:38.06]What the hell are you on?
[245:39.64]When we give the signal, pause for a moment.

[245:47.67]Three, two...

[312:37.81]Jerma in his car.

[312:54.32]You remember that story!
[313:00.54]I need to pay attention to the road!
[313:11.17]Oh my fucking god.
[313:12.19]The last odd, alright, if you, ah, that's... What a thing to bring out right now.
[313:22.79]Alright, if you don't know, I, it was, okay, TL;DR, I was, I had a CD in my car, and I was driving some people, and...
[313:34.32]It's like, oh, what do you got for music?
[313:35.46]And I was like, oh, I listen to this, classical music.
[313:38.56]And I had a video game OST in the fucking CD player.
[313:42.75]And it's a TL;DR, just huge TL;DR.
[313:47.11]This song was just playing, and nobody thought it was cool.
[313:50.99]They were just silent, and I'm just sitting there going, oh, this is music that I really think is cool.
[313:54.32]And it's a video game OST inside the CD player that was like, oh, what's on the radio?
[313:59.05]And it was this song.
[314:00.01]I mean, let's be really honest here.
[314:02.17]This song is fucking fantastic.
[314:04.73]This is one of the best battle musics ever.
[314:07.16]It's too bad that game was like a 7 out of 10.
[314:10.08]It was like a 7.2 out of 10.
[314:12.62]And I wish they made another one because it would have been cool.
[314:14.34]But it was a pretty good game.
[314:15.82]But the song is like a 10 out of 10.
[314:17.26]This is the battle music for Lost Odyssey.
[314:23.56]I just want to hear it again.
[314:53.63]No more, no more of these.
[314:55.14]I already know what it is.
[315:09.29]I already know what it is.
[315:26.27]What is this on Discord, what are you doing?
[315:31.07]What are you doing?
[315:33.47]What are you doing?
[316:05.34]You're scaring me.
[316:14.10]This is so fucking stupid.
[316:16.14]Imagine listening to that shit.
[316:23.10]Oh, back to the fucking game.
[316:27.71]No, the other one.
[316:28.49]What do you mean the other one?
[316:35.00]Okay, why do I... Why do I look... No, no, no, no, no, no!
[316:42.52]Don't play that again!
[316:45.53]Why do I look like every YouTuber you've ever seen?
[316:50.69]Every YouTuber!
[316:57.67]Turn it off, quick!
[316:58.99]Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off!
[317:01.66]I can't turn it off!
[317:08.35]No, stop.
[317:09.01]I have to stop playing it.
[317:12.05]Alright.
[317:12.69]You know what I mean?
[317:13.27]Like, this is... I don't know why my, like, face... This is the way that my face is shaped.
[317:16.94]With the eyes, the mouth, the hair.
[317:18.84]I don't know what... It's a combination of everything.
[317:20.62]I'm, like, a... I'm every YouTuber I've ever seen.
[317:22.92]I feel like this is, like, YouTube thumbnails.
[317:32.85]That's like a... Ugh.
[317:38.36]This one's better.
[317:39.72]How do you still have these?
[317:42.26]I already showed that one.
[317:44.90]Do the other one.
[317:45.64]I just showed it.
[317:48.20]I just showed that one.
[317:54.51]I just showed it.
[317:55.05]Put that on screen.
[317:55.65]There's not already another one, right?
[318:06.38]Are you really going to put that in here after all this?
[318:09.04]That's where you're going after this?
[318:11.26]That's where you're going.
[318:12.48]That's what you're doing.
[318:16.28]Alright.
[318:18.08]You've killed it.
[318:18.90]You've slayed it.
[318:20.12]You killed it.
[318:20.86]Now let's go.
[318:23.80]You've actually killed it.
[318:25.10]You killed it.
[318:31.11]Oh, super golf.
[318:40.24]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[318:41.04]Okay.
[318:41.85]What the fuck?
[318:42.53]Problem?
[320:38.31]The monkey was very impressive.
[320:39.75]Superb.
[320:47.11]Perfect form.
[320:49.53]First try.
[320:50.83]First try.
[320:54.97]Alright.
[320:55.59]That's a golden medal.
[320:57.75]We've only got screw-up back every two, and then we've got one more row.
[321:02.79]We have done it.
[321:05.35]God, I'm so fucking...
[321:10.30]Again, by the way, Community Content Day.
[321:12.12]That's right, it's Community Content Day.
[321:14.38]Community Content Day is going to be tomorrow afternoon.
[321:20.17]Tomorrow morning, probably around 11-ish.
[321:21.25]11.30?
[321:21.27]12?
[321:21.29]12-ish?
[321:22.09]No, no, no, no.
[321:23.93]You know what?
[321:25.87]It's going to be, hmm.
[321:29.03]1?
[321:30.32]1pm?
[321:30.38]Hold on, let me pick them up here.
[321:41.05]1 p.m.
[321:42.97]1 p.m.
[321:43.17]tomorrow is going to be community content day.
[321:46.43]And it's going to be split into two.
[321:51.09]Because there's going to be a lot because I delayed it.
[321:53.19]There's a million reasons why.
[321:55.93]I was going to do the green screen DLC free.
[321:58.41]That didn't work out.
[321:59.09]So what we're going to do tomorrow, we're going to split it into two days.
[322:01.81]So we'll do one this week for a short amount of time.
[322:05.17]And then one next week for a short amount of time.
[322:08.28]There you go.
[322:10.38]That's the plan.
[322:18.88]How long are you going to do EU-friendly streams?
[322:20.74]Oh, you're literally only going to do these two days.
[323:58.83]Alright, we're good.
[324:00.19]We're good.
[324:05.17]Could've been better.
[324:07.85]It could've been better.
[324:10.81]Oh well.
[324:11.66]That's alright.
[324:12.26]That's okay.
[324:14.16]Here's where we store the robot's sense of duty.
[324:17.32]That's okay.
[324:19.98]Re-mix?
[324:21.30]Get a perfect on Samurai Slice 2 right now.
[324:33.37]That's right.
[324:33.93]That's right.
[325:17.49]God.
[325:25.28]You can't mess up two times.
[325:26.38]If you mess up once, it's just fucking over.
[325:29.52]Remix.
[325:29.88]Here we go.
[325:33.56]I didn't.

[325:37.04]Trust me.
[325:39.69]I know.
[325:41.41]Oh, I know.
[325:58.89]They say it's still just nothing but a mad world They say it's just too hard to find yourself But baby that's real good at all You got them going on when they're real good
[326:26.72]Wanna shine, I wanna be loved now You know you just can't leave the past behind you You know you can't just live a life of shining glamour The music plays on and on
[326:52.73]one two three
[327:25.06]into you into you
[327:53.30]All about you, all about you, all about you.
[327:57.72]I have done with that one.
[328:05.59]Who do you think actually lost Omega Loan?
[328:08.07]Ban, then mod, then ban, then mod, then mod him twice, then VIP him, then delete his account, then ban him, and then mod him again!
[328:13.33]And then send him a hundred... I can't say that.
[328:19.16]A hundred... Hello!
[328:22.00]Hello!
[328:22.24]100 hello!
[328:22.58]Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.
[328:25.22]Okay, whatever.
[328:25.82]Times that by 10.
[328:38.44]Disconnected from the last statement.
[328:40.42]The word I was going to say was money.
[328:43.08]Okay.
[328:50.17]Crackin' into you, into you, into you.
[328:52.10]Crackin' into you, into you, into you.
[329:25.90]That's a bit a lot of work.
[330:01.80]Let's read a lot of books.
[330:08.13]One, two, three.
[330:10.55]One, two, three.
[330:13.73]One, two, three.
[330:16.55]One, two, three.
[330:33.17]What the fuck am I doing?
[330:33.87]I just looked over at the preview and I don't like that.
[330:38.71]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[330:48.01]Come on, this is level nine.
[330:53.78]I'm good.
[330:55.60]Pepe left, try again.
[330:56.64]Pepe left.
[331:13.91]Crack me into you, into you, into you.
[331:15.81]Crack me into you, into you, into you.
[331:43.70]You know you just can't leave the past behind you You know you can't just live a life of shining splendor The music plays on and on
[332:07.69]One, two, three.
[332:14.21]One, two, three.
[332:16.73]One, two, three.
[332:18.15]One, two, three.
[332:39.67]I fucking don't like that segment.
[332:41.37]Good enough.
[332:41.91]I got it.
[333:08.54]Because you suck.
[333:12.71]I think Jerma... I suck.
[333:13.63]You know, I don't want to say that because then you'll use it and you'll make me look like I say, I think Jerma... I suck.
[333:20.95]Alright, here we go.
[333:27.44]We're almost there.
[333:29.08]Take your fighter 2.
[333:29.78]The last 5 games.
[333:35.02]And then...
[333:38.24]I'm outta here!
[333:38.76]I need to learn Nightwalk for the final remix.

[335:26.32]Let me rephrase this one.
[335:27.40]Let me rephrase this.
[335:38.87]Here we go again.
[335:40.11]Let me rephrase this one.
[335:42.89]Let me rephrase this one.
[335:56.63]I don't even know the timing of this shit.
[335:58.19]I don't even know the timing of this.
[336:00.40]Whatever.
[336:00.68]We don't figure Fighter 2.
[336:09.52]Oh, no.
[336:09.96]He's so close to Remix 10.
[336:11.44]I am.
[336:11.72]I'm getting there.
[336:12.12]I'll be there soon.
[336:13.61]Is that supposed to punch there?

[337:38.41]One, two.
[337:46.06]I don't think that's gonna do it.
[337:48.56]It is.
[337:50.40]What?
[337:51.36]You don't do like a hailstorm of punching if it's not correct.
[337:55.34]Why is there a bite mark on my arm?
[338:04.35]Microwall 2!
[338:06.29]Unbelievable, the microbes are back!
[338:07.83]Can you believe it?
[338:18.64]I already know the practice.
[338:19.38]I know how it works.
[339:55.74]Is that enough to pass it?
[339:58.12]He's so high.
[340:00.85]Good enough.
[340:01.17]Okay, whatever.
[340:01.59]Who cares?
[340:03.85]I don't... I don't... I'm literally wearing, like, jogging pants.
[340:06.27]There's no flyer.
[340:08.03]What are you talking about?
[340:10.20]For some research, this could be big.
[340:16.38]Oh, no.
[340:16.80]Packing test two.
[340:27.41]doped up on contrast.
[340:31.79]Okay, here we go.
[340:33.07]You still remember your training, right?
[340:34.39]Sort of.
[340:34.67]I thought that wasn't allowed practice.
[340:47.51]I thought that wasn't allowed practice.
[340:51.99]That's your punishment for not doing the Japanese audio.
[340:54.75]You want me to do Japanese audio?
[340:58.12]It actually was an issue.
[341:08.10]Yeah, it is an issue.
[341:09.97]Not bad.
[341:11.37]Alright, time to really see what you're made of.
[341:12.81]How is it going?
[341:13.21]Much faster than what you can do with this new rhythm.
[341:35.39]Nicely done.
[341:38.61]Japanese audio is better for the love rap.
[341:42.52]I could see that.
[341:43.42]That would make sense.
[341:44.96]What happens when we give you an offbeat rhythm?
[341:46.61]If you watch out for the signal, you'll do fine.
[342:21.57]Alright, I'm ready to go.
[342:23.90]What was the one with the wubba lubba dub?
[342:25.32]Is that true?
[342:26.74]That's the wrestler one.
[342:27.88]We did it already.
[342:28.88]I wonder if there's a second part of it.
[342:33.10]I wonder.
[342:33.38]Good luck with your overtime shift.
[342:36.36]Good luck.
[342:37.52]It's called ringside.
[342:38.40]Here we go.
[343:53.87]That's Jerva!
[343:54.37]They put Jerva in the game!
[343:55.22]It was Jerva!
[343:55.76]That's Jerva!
[343:56.12]That's Jerva95!
[343:56.44]You ever heard of that guy?
[343:58.18]I've earned a rest.
[343:59.96]That's tricky.
[344:01.18]What's the last one?
[344:03.34]Karate Man 2.
[344:04.10]Karate Joe's intense training regimen continues.
[344:10.21]Can you help him reach the height of mastery?
[344:12.21]No practice.
[344:14.31]Oh lord.
[344:17.41]This is going to be probably pretty hard.
[344:20.98]Alright, we're going to take a guess.
[344:31.97]Bring it on.
[344:34.88]No, I'm trying.
[344:35.66]It's like, fuck you.

[347:26.67]Nice throw.
[347:27.41]I didn't throw.
[347:28.09]I just didn't expect it.
[347:29.54]That was probably pretty good.
[347:30.76]You took the rhythm changes in stride, and you still got okay.
[347:33.90]Whatever.
[347:36.24]It's just the end.
[347:36.90]I fucked it up.
[347:38.70]I must focus my power and re-tie my belt.
[347:41.28]Okay, how many bat medals do I have?
[347:45.02]I need one more medal to do the other one.
[347:47.07]Remix 10.
[347:49.43]Let's mix things up.
[347:51.05]This one will test you on everything you've learned.
[347:53.71]It's pretty tough.
[347:56.18]Final block.
[347:58.26]Let me get this first guy.

[414:30.74]You know when you're singing along with a song, and you have headphones in, and the song is louder than you are?
[414:42.65]That's how you can tell if somebody can really sing or not, because when they sing along with a song, they're singing along, they can't really realize that there are people, you can't, I can't hear anything, you know what I mean?
[414:53.45]So when you sing along with a song, that, first of all, like I'm speech jamming myself with a song.
[414:58.38]So, when you sing along with a song, if somebody has earphones in, and the earphones are loud, and they're singing along, they typically sound... Like, you can tell if somebody can really sing or not, because they... Alright, you know what?
[415:10.75]I can't even explain this.
[415:12.87]I could've, but I can't.
[415:14.31]Alright.
[415:15.39]When somebody has loud music playing and is singing along to it,
[415:25.21]Let me go over here.
[415:26.33]Somebody has loud music playing and is singing to it.
[415:29.62]If they're singing very poorly, they don't know that they're singing poorly.
[415:34.58]So, you can hear all their voice cracks and shit, and they don't know that you can hear that for some reason.
[415:40.38]I think I got it.
[415:40.96]I think I got it.
[415:41.74]I feel like I was just doing that.
[415:44.76]Kim, call the- call the hospital!
[415:50.09]You're- you smell toast.
[415:53.15]Yeah, actually.
[416:00.81]Hey, it's been a long day.
[416:01.72]What are you talking about?
[416:04.06]Seven hours of staring at a screen, dancing.
[416:08.80]I've been conducting an orchestra for seven hours.
[416:12.50]I'm getting this one.
[416:17.35]Everybody, we've got to end this fucking box deck.
[416:20.51]And we'll try to end this.
[416:22.81]I've got to go.
[416:24.23]That was cool.
[416:25.06]Did you see that?
[416:30.25]High grain lo-fi.
[417:12.55]Alright, I'm done.
[417:14.13]I'm done.
[417:14.39]I can't do this anymore.
[417:17.27]I'm gonna have fucking nightmares tonight.
[417:18.87]I'm gonna have some fucking dreams tonight.
[417:21.68]Alright, last one.
[417:34.68]You're not done until we SAY you're done.
[417:41.22]Why am I... What are you talking about?
[419:40.48]Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
[419:41.66]That was fun.
[419:44.44]Did I get the gold medal?
[419:46.79]I did.
[419:47.81]Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[419:48.89]There's one more minigame to play that I want to play.
[419:52.19]It feels so good to belong.
[419:54.57]36, right?
[419:56.83]No, I don't want that.
[419:58.29]With the extra games? 38.
[420:11.16]Do the fish level.
[420:11.88]No, I refuse.
[420:12.80]What's in endless?
[420:14.53]Oh shit, I didn't even see these.
[420:16.97]Wake up, caller.
[420:17.79]I didn't even see these.
[420:18.85]I didn't see them.
[420:22.57]Wake me up with an alarm.
[420:23.75]Okay.
[420:25.81]Wake me up at 8am.
[420:28.09]There's A when the clock exactly is at 8 o'clock.
[420:32.51]Wake up.
[420:43.22]Well done.
[420:45.22]But can you do it when you can't see the clock?
[420:47.12]3, 2, 1, go!
[420:56.28]1, 2, 3, 4!
[421:02.62]Get up.
[421:06.30]Try a different rhythm.
[421:07.08]830.
[421:08.53]Oh, shit.
[421:16.97]We can do 830.
[421:17.83]3, 2, 1, go!
[421:20.39]1, 2, 3, 4!
[421:20.87]3, 2, 1, go!
[421:21.37]1, 2, 3, 4!
[421:21.79]5, 6, 7, 8.
[421:50.50]Can't count.
[421:51.22]Omega lull.
[421:54.45]It's easy when you know the secret.
[421:55.63]I'm counting on you for a perfect night's sleep.
[422:00.15]Wake me up at eight.
[422:03.37]Three, two, one, go.
[422:06.51]One, two, three, four.
[422:15.98]What time is it?
[422:20.64]8 o'clock exactly.
[422:21.36]Flower.
[422:21.54]This takes a while.
[422:22.37]At night?
[422:22.67]Wake me up at 10.
[422:23.23]I can do 10.
[422:25.25]3, 2, 1, go!
[422:27.25]1, 2, 3, 4!
[422:47.50]I don't know why I'm doing this to you for some reason, but I am.
[422:50.66]Like, I'm doing it to you.
[422:59.52]If I get five in a row, then I get all the flowers, right?
[423:10.95]Banana cream pie?
[423:11.79]Why the fuck did you say that?
[423:14.79]What a dick.
[423:15.97]What a dick.
[423:16.85]Because now that's all I care about.
[423:18.09]Okay.
[423:19.59]3, 2, 1, go!
[423:20.25]1, 2, 3, 4!
[423:20.85]Hey, Tarty.
[423:21.83]Hey, Tarty.
[423:45.65]It's 8.30.
[423:51.21]Here's a greasy pepperoni pizza on a delicious Boston pizza.
[423:55.23]6 a.m.
[423:56.40]3, 2, 1, go!
[424:00.08]1, 2, 3, 4!
[424:06.96]I feel like I'm entertaining children.
[424:08.67]You know what I mean?
[424:11.69]That was not early.
[424:13.51]Stop!
[424:15.22]Other people that just hit add, I want you to delete your comment.
[424:21.46]You aren't.
[424:23.28]You are.
[424:23.78]You are.
[424:26.44]You are.
[424:30.48]12 p.m.
[424:32.40]12 p.m.
[424:33.48]Wait a minute.
[424:34.63]What time is it right now?
[424:36.71]It's 12 a.m.
[424:37.39]right now.
[424:38.63]So I gotta wait.
[424:39.31]I gotta go 12.
[424:44.26]Three, two, one, go!
[424:47.90]One, two, three, four!
[425:02.99]Exactly!
[425:05.65]I win!
[425:07.51]Okay, Steve, you're a sicko.
[425:14.18]Why am I sick of doing this?
[425:17.58]11 a.m.
[425:18.60]This actually is not as hard as I thought it was going to be.
[425:36.04]And you're watching the Disney Channel.
[425:37.74]Beep.
[425:45.80]What's the B for?
[425:46.56]What is a B?
[425:46.84]10-30.
[425:47.06]3, 2, 1, GO!
[425:48.92]1, 2, 3, 4!
[425:49.96]It's endless.
[426:20.48]Three, two, one, go!
[426:23.60]One, two, three!
[426:50.23]I can take that back.
[426:55.97]I'm pretty good at this.
[426:56.71]What's it gonna spell?
[426:57.71]Bee?
[426:57.85]Bow?
[426:57.97]Bone?
[426:58.31]Bout?
[426:58.57]Bounty?
[427:02.13]Bounce?
[427:04.27]Boomer.
[427:05.29]840 AM.
[427:07.17]Holy shit.
[427:08.05]Is it even possible?
[427:21.05]That was fun.
[427:22.43]Alright, what is Munchy Monk?
[427:51.48]I don't know what it's spelled.
[427:54.07]It's time to continue your training.
[427:55.63]We'll begin with the simplest task.
[427:58.23]Press A to feed the egg to your companion.
[428:04.45]One egg!
[428:06.07]Is that right?
[428:08.51]One egg!
[428:13.13]One egg!
[428:16.31]That'll do.
[428:16.75]Next you must master many food items.
[428:26.93]Am I spitting them in his mouth?
[428:28.69]This is disgusting.
[428:36.91]That's sufficient.
[428:37.50]Okay.
[428:40.42]Do not forget what you have learned.
[428:42.00]So eggs is A. Now use these lessons to feed.
[428:45.22]Why do I have tickets?
[428:45.98]Why do I have manco tickets?
[429:18.53]One egg.
[429:19.05]One egg.
[429:19.57]One egg.
[429:20.25]Handful of peas.
[429:21.25]Handful of peas.
[429:22.11]One egg.
[429:22.59]One egg.
[429:23.13]One egg.
[429:23.83]One egg.
[429:24.33]One egg.
[429:25.23]One egg.
[429:26.87]One egg.
[429:27.61]One egg.
[429:28.43]One egg.
[429:29.11]Handful of peas.
[429:30.43]Handful of peas. 200.
[430:02.98]Peace.
[430:34.28]I think Lady Cupid... Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, Lady Cupid, and I'm done.
[430:39.27]Aim for the center.
[430:41.01]One, two, three, four!
[430:43.45]Fun as hell.
[430:44.73]Let's go.
[430:46.45]One, two, three, four!
[430:48.71]Okay.
[431:04.51]Blow it up.
[431:08.61]That's Palutena.
[431:09.63]Palutena.
[431:10.25]I guess it could be Palutena.
[431:33.50]Kermit's a synthetic human that doesn't eat.
[431:42.76]No, I do.
[431:43.44]And I will be.
[431:44.10]Like, this is it.
[431:47.97]This is the last game.
[431:52.01]And then, I gotta get out of here.
[431:53.95]For real.
[431:54.89]It's been fun, though.
[431:55.65]This has been wild.
[431:56.37]I love this game.
[432:05.61]I got Parappa 2.
[432:18.43]Uh, I played Parappa 2.
[432:22.98]I beat Parappa 2.
[432:23.98]It was a great stream, a lot of fun.
[432:28.84]That's what a Sith would say.
[432:29.92]Synth?
[432:30.42]One, two, three, four!
[432:31.24]One, two, three, four!
[433:02.84]Got it.
[433:04.94]Manga S. This probably keeps going.
[433:08.57]I'd be more precise than that.
[433:10.43]He's coming.
[433:11.57]He's going to assimilate us.
[433:13.21]Sorting algorithm.
[433:27.99]Come on, make it harder.
[433:29.62]Let's go.
[433:30.22]Make it harder than this.
[433:56.64]I can do better.
[433:58.46]What's wrong with your head when you're shooting?
[434:01.26]It's called gamer skill.
[434:02.50]One, two, three, four!
[434:04.68]Gamer, yeah, it's called gaming neck.
[434:07.80]One, two, three, four!
[434:30.37]He's got his gamer stance.
[434:35.77]One, two, three, four!
[434:40.85]Can this... I gotta get this harder.
[434:46.65]Can this get harder?
[434:47.29]I have so many arrows.
[434:52.12]One, two, three, four!
[435:08.03]I lost a little bit of the mojo there, but it's alright.
[435:14.32]I want to be insane.
[435:16.02]We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[435:32.57]It's hard now.
[436:00.86]That's what I wanted.
[436:04.44]I had so many arrows.
[436:06.56]Yeah, I forget the 50,000.
[436:07.74]I don't care either.
[436:29.70]One, two, three, four!
[436:53.71]One, two, three, four!
[437:13.96]I can't be distracted right now.
[437:14.98]This is the last game.
[437:16.86]I can't be distracted.
[437:18.22]That's great.
[437:36.71]I can't be distracted right now.
[437:38.97]I know, I've already looked at it.
[437:39.93]You can't, you know, I've already seen it.
[437:41.95]I think that's a fucking huge moment right there.
[437:45.33]Don't stay behind me, that's fucking scary.
[438:11.85]I'm not choking.
[438:12.55]I've got 100 arrows.
[438:13.83]Oh, dude, he's choking.
[438:15.03]He's got 70 more shots.
[438:16.42]I'm fine.
[438:17.72]Okay.
[438:42.97]I'm never going to lose this.
[438:45.13]I have to quit.
[438:46.56]I'm never going to lose.
[438:48.08]I will actually never lose.
[439:17.15]I'm not gonna- I will never fucking lose.
[439:19.91]It's just not possible.
[439:23.50]I'll go for 100k.
[439:24.06]Alright, when I get 100k, I'm done.
[439:24.94]He's gonna choke.
[439:25.98]Why would I choke?
[439:46.56]One, two, three, four!
[439:48.90]It's too easy.
[440:14.42]It is not.
[440:14.90]Two with your eyes closed.
[440:16.66]No, I don't know.
[440:18.47]Why would I do that?
[440:20.41]I gotta get to 100k.
[440:24.87]100k and I'm turning the stream off.
[440:46.23]The understanding only needs to hit the middle.
[441:02.26]One, two, three, four!
[441:10.68]Two, three more and I'm leaving.
[441:15.40]Don't keep speeding up until you shoot once.
[441:20.88]What was that, Haruka?
[441:23.94]Just admit that you're having fun.
[441:47.81]One, two, three, four!
[442:16.15]I can't stop, but I have to leave.
[442:18.67]I have to leave.
[442:19.15]I have to, like, actually turn this room off in the next, like, 25 minutes.
[442:46.08]One, two, three, four!
[443:09.83]Run out of arrows.
[443:29.96]Run out of arrows.
[443:39.52]Ah, it's gonna close One two three four
[444:20.33]125k, that's fine.
[444:20.77]That's a lot.
[444:21.37]Highest ever posted is 180k. 127,000.
[444:47.88]That's pretty good.
[444:48.90]That's pretty good.
[444:49.60]I lost there.
[444:50.06]It's all good.
[444:54.07]You see what it is?
[444:54.51]You told me that the highest ever score was I was getting close.
[444:57.51]So that's why I was like, I can't.
[444:58.57]I freaked out.
[445:00.21]Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
[445:02.23]Tomorrow we're going to do a short stream in the morning again.
[445:04.91]Well, no we're not.
[445:05.79]That's why.
[445:06.29]It's going to be 1pm.
[445:07.41]We're going to do a short community content stream tomorrow afternoon at about 1pm Pacific.
[445:15.16]I'll see you guys there.
[445:17.88]We're going to split up the community night into two different days.
[445:22.51]This game is fucking fantastic.
[445:24.01]What a fun time.
[445:25.09]What a stream.
[445:25.63]You know what I mean?
[445:27.67]That's why I looked around like, right?
[445:29.95]Right, guys?
[445:31.21]Seriously.
[445:32.15]That was a lot of fun.
[445:34.63]And that's going to be the end.
[445:44.18]Bye.
[445:44.44]You guys are fucking freaking me out here.
[445:48.91]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[445:50.43]Tomorrow at 1pm Pacific!
[445:51.07]Bye.
[445:51.17]I'm sticking around for the bits, we're gonna do them very quickly.
[445:59.95]Here we go.
[446:10.03]Where's the music?
[446:11.59]There it is.
[446:12.45]That was... With a Wii.
[446:20.93]I know, I've got the image right here.
[446:23.01]I've got the image.
[446:24.13]Yes, it's as scary as all of them have been.
[446:37.35]Alright, let's go back to earlier.
[446:40.70]This afternoon.
[446:47.06]I think.
[446:50.17]This is all wrong, so I'm going to go pull it from the other site.
[446:53.93]But I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[447:00.48]If you're leaving, if you're staying...
[447:03.70]And we're going to go over this.
[447:04.96]Plasma Player, thanks for the $2.50, Plasma Player.
[447:07.66]I can't believe my favorite streamer is playing one of my favorite franchises.
[447:11.02]17 days into 2020, and you've already made my year.
[447:13.70]Thanks for playing Rhythm Heaven Fever.
[447:15.52]It was great.
[447:17.14]Except for the fish level.
[447:19.88]Fish level sucks.
[447:22.06]I think the fish level sucks.
[447:24.08]I really believe that.
[447:24.98]I really do.
[447:29.02]Thank you, Plasma Player.
[447:29.98]Appreciate it.
[447:32.47]Hey, GermaSucks, thanks for the $2.50.
[447:33.93]Enable Pog, you dork.
[447:35.85]That's another website.
[447:36.65]I'll have to figure it out.
[447:38.62]Hillsint, thanks for the five community subs.
[447:40.36]Appreciate it.
[447:41.38]This is during the hype frame with those two of them, which is just ridiculous.
[447:47.12]FF12Penelo, thanks for the $2.50.
[447:49.62]Thanks for the early stream because I'm at work eating popcorn.
[447:53.06]LOL.
[447:53.36]Happy Friday.
[447:54.06]Happy Friday to you as well.
[447:56.03]Hope you had a good one.
[447:59.54]We'll see tomorrow.
[448:00.42]Tomorrow's stream will probably be around three hours.
[448:02.78]Between, like, two and four.
[448:04.04]I just want to chill.
[448:05.70]I got a lot of stuff going on this weekend.
[448:07.92]I'm trying to fit some streams in.
[448:09.16]But, yeah.
[448:11.12]It'll be fun.
[448:13.65]L.M.
[448:14.35]Man.
[448:14.73]Thank you, L.M.
[448:15.43]Man, for the 1,500 bits.
[448:18.31]15 bucks.
[448:18.63]You are a king of clowns.
[448:26.71]I appreciate that.
[448:27.28]Thank you.
[448:30.11]Uh, Heppel Abel, thank you Heppel Abel for the 500 bits.
[448:32.92]No message, just 500 bits.
[448:33.84]And then we had a shitload of community subs come in.
[448:36.46]We had Jatootie, Jabootie gave 5.
[448:40.44]Kaj, Kajtech gave 5.
[448:43.38]Red Lemonade, 10 community subs.
[448:45.02]AB Joe, 5.
[448:47.14]Red Lemonade, again, 10 more subs on top of the ones already.
[448:50.49]It's time for Slime, 5.
[448:51.91]100 bits.
[448:54.13]Early stream hype, scam train hype.
[448:57.59]There were two scam trains tonight.
[449:01.55]Wait, there's a wink?
[449:02.73]You're gonna make me turn my fucking camera on?
[449:06.72]What?
[449:11.92]No.
[449:12.54]Was there actually a wink?
[449:17.57]No, there wasn't.
[449:23.13]Yeah, I've already shown this image on the stream!
[449:27.01]I showed it on stream!
[449:30.55]I showed it on stream!
[449:35.44]We don't have to spare the same link!
[449:41.68]Is this what I look like?
[449:54.90]Thanks, though.
[450:00.09]Yeah, thank you.
[450:00.65]It's time for slime, though.
[450:02.03]XGiga, thanks for the five community subs.
[450:04.13]Sumia, five community subs.
[450:09.00]AnonymousGifter, five community subs.
[450:14.86]Guys, I showed these... I'm not even... I've shown the Germtalix one already.
[450:24.51]Stop it!
[450:28.76]Stop it!
[450:35.64]Stop it!
[450:38.97]There's so many of these, what the fuck?
[450:40.83]You know, what do your parents think if they find the I melded two streamers together image?
[450:53.21]If your parents walked in right now and they saw that you were in the middle of fusing two people's faces together... What are they... Are they gonna be like... Honey, what the fuck are you doing?
[451:05.31]Oh, sorry, Bob.
[451:06.05]I was fusing two streamers together.
[451:09.26]Isn't that cool?
[451:10.32]And then they're gonna be like... Son or daughter?
[451:14.94]Um... What?
[451:17.60]I don't... I don't fucking think I... Why, was my mother swearing?
[451:22.19]Shut up, Jeremy.
[451:23.05]It makes me laugh.
[451:24.30]Alright, let's go.
[451:45.08]But thank you to Red Lemonade for the 10.
[451:47.32]And the 5 from XGiga and Sumaya.
[451:51.11]AnonymousGifter gave 5.
[451:52.73]Ruff gave 5.
[451:53.77]GermaSucks, 10 community subs.
[451:55.49]Thank you, guys.
[451:58.05]And we have some dreams here.
[452:01.15]Snooze and Copter, thanks for the 250.
[452:04.47]You appeared in my dream last night, Jerma.
[452:06.09]It happened to me too.
[452:08.23]You were in a pre-stream chat and you were very excitedly talking about a new big stream you had planned.
[452:13.27]About something you bought that simulates probability.
[452:17.83]It almost looked like roulette in a can with tiny rice balls.
[452:22.29]So you could pull it out and decide how many balls should be in it.
[452:25.51]And then you went to a blackboard to teach all of us about the math of probability.
[452:29.56]So we had to get our notes out and write stuff down.
[452:39.55]I feel like I've done something like that already, but, I mean, it's close enough.
[452:44.59]Thank you, but, weird dream, though, that's... Thank you, Dark Soul, for the 250.
[452:50.46]Did you ever have my Domino's pizza suggestion?
[452:53.56]Um, the one with the garlic sauce?
[452:55.68]I did not.
[452:56.86]I did not.
[452:57.28]I haven't really been to Domino's.
[452:59.18]Well, if I ever go, I will do it.
[453:01.30]Also, I have to apologize now for giving you shit for streaming VR for four hours.
[453:05.32]I got an index and was sweating after, like, two Beat Saber songs.
[453:09.11]And I go to the gym every day for one to two hours.
[453:12.29]Hope we see more when the doctors fix your glass bones and paper skin.
[453:17.43]Pepe hands.
[453:18.03]Yeah, I know.
[453:18.45]Me too.
[453:20.36]Me too.
[453:21.22]I'm in the same boat.
[453:24.96]Who do I follow?
[453:25.76]Me.
[453:26.42]You should be following me.
[453:28.22]Follow me.
[453:28.64]Follow me.
[453:29.28]Me.
[453:29.64]Right now.
[453:29.92]Click the follow button.
[453:30.60]Just do it.
[453:32.75]Question that.
[453:33.21]Come on.
[453:34.44]Oh my god, Taeyeon, thanks for the 500 bits.
[453:36.74]I was supposed to build a PC today.
[453:38.15]This is going to be my first build ever.
[453:41.67]All the parts came in, I cleaned the area, I have your PC doctor video loaded up, and I have my spice rack ready.
[453:47.97]You just had to stream this great game, but I'm loving every minute of it.
[453:54.13]Uh, good luck with your PC build.
[453:56.29]Hopefully you don't put egg wash in your motherboard.
[453:58.95]That would make it not work.
[454:00.63]Oops.
[454:03.83]Uh, thank you Tupac Alive for the 300 bits.
[454:06.29]They say hi.
[454:06.93]Thank you.
[454:08.77]Hi.
[454:09.51]How are you?
[454:11.67]Uh, Shwetty Man, thanks for the five community subs.
[454:13.71]As well as we had Zixia.
[454:15.95]Zixica.
[454:17.15]Zixica.
[454:17.71]Zixica.
[454:22.84]A 50 community sub.
[454:26.42]Thank you for the huge amount of subs.
[454:28.36]Thank you also to Autumn Dragons for the 250.
[454:30.55]Hey, Jerma, first time sending big bits.
[454:32.77]Just want to let you know how much you mean to me and my friends.
[454:35.31]These streams are always the greatest.
[454:36.45]Also, I think it's time we bring this back.
[454:40.43]What is bring this back?
[454:43.79]Oh, the Remix 10, yeah.
[454:46.17]With the Jerma, yeah.
[454:47.07]That was... That was quite interesting.
[454:50.41]Now I get it.
[454:51.01]Now I know what it is.
[454:52.64]You should do Patapon.
[454:53.52]Alright, fine.
[454:55.62]Put it on the list.
[454:57.28]I'll do it.
[454:58.66]Potion Dweller, thanks for the $2.50.
[454:59.94]I was super excited when I heard you say you got Mega Man Legends 1 and 2 yesterday.
[455:05.38]I feel I should let you know that 2 is actually 3 in the game story-wise.
[455:10.03]There's a side game called Misadventures of Tronbone, and it's 100% worth getting.
[455:15.89]Also, Mega Man Legends was before they figured out lock-on control, so it may be a little clunky.
[455:20.67]It's still great.
[455:21.35]You can get Misadventures on the PS3 store for like $5.
[455:23.59]Yeah, I played Mega Man Legends when it first came out.
[455:29.22]I don't remember that much of it, but I remember enough for me to want to play it again.
[455:36.50]But yeah, thanks.
[455:37.46]I'll probably get it.
[455:39.61]Yeah, I'm streaming those, yeah.
[455:41.51]All the Mega Man Legends, I'll do them.
[455:43.81]Probably not in a row, but I'm going to do them.
[455:50.51]I'm not sure why should I follow you?
[455:51.89]Do you make something popular?
[455:54.47]Did I make something popular?
[455:57.67]Uh... No, not really.
[456:02.20]No.
[456:02.36]I don't think anything, nothing you'd know.
[456:08.20]I don't think anything you know.
[456:09.50]Nah, probably not.
[456:10.12]Turn the music back on.
[456:17.17]Oh, wait, no.
[456:17.89]You might know me from one of my most viewed videos on YouTube.
[456:21.35]Halloween level wave 666.
[456:23.57]It's got like 10 million views or something.
[456:28.06]Yeah, for some reason.
[456:29.12]You might know me from that.
[456:35.84]Yeah, that's probably how you would know me.
[456:42.51]That keeps popping up on my feed.
[456:44.33]I don't know why that happens.
[456:46.93]Why that video?
[456:47.77]I don't know.
[456:51.16]But, thank you.
[456:52.46]Appreciate it.
[456:52.96]Thank you, Cell Juniors for the $10.
[456:55.18]You go, big guy.
[456:56.26]Pose for the fans.
[456:58.64]I did plenty of poses tonight, I think.
[457:03.51]That's Jerma.
[457:04.07]I know him from the servers.
[457:05.09]Hey, Koh- Kohi-Len!
[457:07.31]Thanks for the 250.
[457:09.79]Good day, Jerma.
[457:10.67]If you're still looking for a replacement mouse, it seems like Razer made a Death Adder version 2, and the rubber sides aren't scuffed anymore.
[457:18.05]Also, which anime are you gonna watch this year for your once-a-year viewing rule?
[457:22.55]Uh, Ayaya Forever, my good dude.
[457:27.55]Um... Nah, I'm gonna get an Amazon Basics mouse for the next mouse.
[457:35.23]What anime am I gonna... I don't know.
[457:37.34]I kind of just... I just fall into something.
[457:43.52]Use code FUCKFACE on checkout.
[457:47.18]I haven't decided yet.
[457:47.87]Because it is 2020, you're right.
[457:49.25]We'll see.
[457:52.80]I know what it actually says, but I'm not going to say it because people will make me apologize.
[457:55.86]So it's not just a wink?
[457:56.76]No, it's just a wink.
[457:57.36]It's only a wink.
[457:58.82]Otherwise, if you start to have special requests, it's going to have to be 100,000 points for a special request.
[458:24.21]75,000 points for a wink.
[458:26.21]100,000 points for a wink with a special request.
[458:29.36]By the way, I'm sorry for saying yeah, yeah, yeah earlier.
[458:31.34]I'm sorry.
[458:33.24]I do apologize for that.
[458:36.74]The Great Lord Walden, thanks for the 500 bits.
[458:39.24]Oh, yeah.
[458:39.89]They just say, oh, yeah.
[458:41.95]Thank you.
[458:42.41]Zake, thanks for the 250.
[458:43.53]Yo, Merry Christmas.
[458:44.25]Got a serious question for you.
[458:45.91]What's the biggest difference between streamer Jerma and real life Jeremy?
[458:49.27]Tears from a land far, far away.
[458:55.76]Not very much, to be honest.
[459:02.60]I think the only difference really probably is... And I'm going to be honest with you.
[459:08.80]Real life Jeremy doesn't play video games.
[459:13.10]Like he used to.
[459:15.33]If I play a game, it's on stream here with you guys.
[459:18.63]I don't really do it off stream.
[459:20.95]I sometimes, maybe a little bit.
[459:24.01]But, I mean, the streams are on for, you know, six to eight hours, seven plus hours, three or four times a week.
[459:33.01]That's the time that I'm gaming.
[459:34.42]That's the time that I'm playing anything, that I'm doing anything that I normally would do.
[459:37.90]When I'm not streaming, I do very kind of boring stuff.
[459:42.60]I don't do a whole lot.
[459:48.22]It's almost like when a stream is over, like for instance for today, right?
[459:51.12]Let's just give today as an example.
[459:52.92]So I just played Rhythm Heaven for seven hours.
[459:57.78]I typically would play Rhythm Heaven for seven hours off stream on Tuesday or something.
[460:03.99]But I did it here instead.
[460:06.81]So the only difference is really just, at least for gaming wise, is the stream is on.
[460:11.71]You know what I'm saying?
[460:16.04]So they happen at the same time.
[460:19.18]Like if Sekiro came out, right?
[460:21.70]I wanted to play Sekiro.
[460:22.98]I really wanted to play it.
[460:24.08]I was super excited for it.
[460:26.56]But I just played it on stream.
[460:31.69]And after, you know, it's been seven hours, my goal right now is not, oh, I just played Rhythm Heaven for seven hours.
[460:37.57]I'm going to stop, turn the stream off, but I'm going to go turn on Rhythm Heaven for like four more hours.
[460:41.33]And that's just, I wouldn't game that long anyways.
[460:46.27]Normally speaking.
[460:51.23]Are there games that I prefer to play alone?
[460:52.67]Yeah, I do.
[460:54.81]There's plenty of stuff that I've done off-stream that I didn't feel like doing on-stream.
[461:02.02]But that's rare.
[461:03.92]It doesn't happen that much.
[461:07.23]But yeah, there's your answer.
[461:09.53]Probably the main difference.
[461:12.57]uh thumbs up thanks to the 250 this is one of my favorite games ever and you're my favorite streamer ever glad you had fun with it I did it was great wembley ttv thanks to the 250 wow you go compact guy thanks to the 250 sticks renegade 250 I can guarantee that changing your own oil is easier than this level it probably is

[461:47.47]Jay Hansil.
[461:49.05]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[461:51.83]Jeremy, you look like a dry, shriveled up prune playing this game.
[461:54.35]Thank you for your content.
[461:55.17]You're my favorite boomer.
[462:04.19]I don't... It's hard to be 35, okay?
[462:05.93]It's hard being 35.
[462:08.14]Thank you, NickNack, for the five community subs earlier.
[462:12.76]Bugbear and Frog, 500 bits.
[462:15.00]Congrats on beating Remix 10's Sour Please.

[462:39.42]Scam train.
[462:40.28]This is where the other scam train happened.
[462:43.94]Thank you for the 300 bits during the scam train.
[462:47.30]Filactory gave the $50, 5,000 bits and the 69 community subs during the scam train.
[462:52.59]Appreciate it.
[462:53.09]That's fucking ridiculous, as always.
[463:00.72]Bad nutrition, 500 bits during level 4 of this game train.
[463:07.34]Pugles, thanks for 750.
[463:09.02]They say, Jerma, I... Oh, God.
[463:14.97]Hyperband, 250.
[463:15.59]No message.
[463:20.57]Fluid, Mezik, 10 community subs.
[463:23.89]Thank you, Fluid.
[463:24.41]10 community subs is a lot of subs.
[463:31.36]It's a lot of money.
[463:35.95]You guys drop this shit just all the time.
[463:39.87]It's a lot of money.
[463:43.21]Thank you.
[463:45.91]Hey, Mr. Goido.
[463:47.31]Is it Goido or Goido?
[463:50.18]Goido?
[463:51.70]Mr. Goido.
[463:53.28]Thanks for the $2.50.
[463:56.08]Get on the scam train.
[463:57.18]Let the bits rain.
[464:04.44]It's a Dorito.
[464:09.82]It's like from Family Guy.
[464:14.98]What?
[464:15.50]Oh.
[464:15.86]Oh, shit.
[464:16.56]It's 4.
[464:16.94]What?
[464:17.62]It's... Yeah.
[464:18.56]Scam Train!
[464:32.31]Attack of the Hank.
[464:33.05]Thanks for the $4.13.
[464:33.89]That's where you guys are getting it from.
[464:41.44]So when can we expect a midlife crisis stream where you scream at us about how more mortality is fleeting and you'll just wait till you see your mortality crumble before your eyes?
[464:49.81]Didn't that happen 45 minutes ago when I was playing Remix 10?
[464:53.55]I feel like it did.
[464:56.41]The equivalent of that.
[464:59.13]Thanks, Tack and Hank.
[464:59.79]They say, hey, Jerm, a big fan of yours.
[465:01.52]I know this is kind of a specific request, but I'm a nerd for a webcomic called Homestuck.
[465:06.24]And I'd love you to take a, if you took a personality quiz associated with it.
[465:16.65]I'm not taking a personality test right now.
[465:20.87]I know I'm kind of putting you on the spot, and it might take as long as 15 minutes to complete it.
[465:24.89]I won't be offended if you decide to not take it.
[465:27.68]Either way, I love the stream.
[465:31.38]I'm not going to take it right now.
[465:32.96]I'm seeing a lot of people freak out.
[465:36.84]I will pay you to not.
[465:37.78]Why is everybody losing their mind about this?
[465:43.21]Holy shit, people are freaking out.
[465:45.49]Ban that person.
[465:46.43]What?
[465:47.85]What's going on?
[465:50.36]just swang a bat at a hornet's nest I did alright thank you I appreciate the personality test but I'm uh running out of time today I did personality test before I added to the list I'll do it on like a tier list or maybe I will I I don't know maybe it's possible I really appreciate it though it's divisive I don't okay I don't even know what this is
[466:12.90]What just happened?
[466:13.46]I don't know.
[466:13.74]I said the word homestuck, and then I looked over at chat, and people, like, dropped their food on the ground, and all their plates shattered, and they were screaming.
[466:20.28]I don't know what happened.
[466:26.30]But thank you, Attack of the Hank.
[466:27.28]Maybe I'll do it at some other time.
[466:30.16]Uh, suck on memes.
[466:32.57]Thanks for the 250.
[466:33.23]Hey, Jerm, I bet you can't win a game of Civilization, or I'll give you a thousand bits.
[466:36.91]Vanilla?
[466:37.27]No, never.
[466:38.51]I will never play Civilization on stream.
[466:39.99]Not gonna happen.
[466:41.82]Thousand bits.
[466:42.36]That's ten.
[466:42.92]Ten dollars is really enticing, but I will never play that game on stream.
[466:47.01]Ever.
[466:49.55]Flinsenberg, thanks for the five hundred bits.
[466:50.93]Hey, Jeremiah just got back from seeing 1917 in theaters, and it's a great film.
[466:54.95]I highly recommend it.
[466:56.37]Anyways, I love the stream, man.
[466:57.45]Keep up the great work.
[466:59.85]I did hear it was really good.
[467:00.71]That's the one where they made it so it looked like it was one take.
[467:04.43]I gotta check that out.
[467:05.61]That's really interesting to me.
[467:08.17]Alright, let's get the credits on here.
[467:09.09]I'm going to roll out, and I'll see you guys tomorrow around 1 p.m.
[467:13.61]Pacific time for a few hours.
[467:15.81]It's going to be a short stream, but we'll hang out.
[467:18.11]It'll be fun.
[467:21.52]Let's toss the credits up here.
[467:33.48]They didn't actually... They didn't do that, did they?
[467:35.10]No, they didn't.
[467:37.07]Did they?
[467:38.94]They seriously get rid of the live events on the stream labs over here.
[467:45.08]What have you done?
[467:49.87]What are you... What have you done?
[467:52.21]Oh, fuck.
[467:56.73]Oh, I'm gonna log into the website.
[467:58.93]Uh-huh.
[468:02.73]Hey, thanks everybody for subbing.
[468:03.73]All of you.
[468:04.05]Holy shit.
[468:05.83]That's a wrong spot.
[468:07.53]But that's still going very fast.
[468:12.44]That's a lot.
[468:13.06]Stop using Streamlabs.
[468:14.60]I know.
[468:16.20]But it's... With anything, I've set up so many things on it.
[468:20.10]And so many scenes in my stream deck and buttons and shit.
[468:24.05]That going back is a huge process.
[468:27.31]And I'm just like... Don't worry.
[468:29.57]I'll do it.
[468:30.01]I will do it.
[468:32.84]But thanks for the subs, guys.
[468:34.25]Thanks for sticking around.
[468:34.93]The stream is still over 10,000 subs, which is surprising.
[468:42.41]I still can't believe that two or three weeks after New Year's.
[468:45.19]That's fucking crazy.
[468:50.01]But we're going to finish the stream up here.
[468:54.23]We have a few more bits to do.
[468:55.49]Fitty gave 250.
[468:56.05]They say, here you go.
[468:58.23]Log in with Twitch and just enable it, just like with BTTV.
[469:01.11]People that have BTTV can see Frankerface Z emotes.
[469:04.58]Don't worry.
[469:05.10]Now enable Pog.
[469:06.16]Jesus, fuck.
[469:07.40]Also, the site might take a while to load.
[469:08.84]It's a little slow.
[469:12.86]I just clicked it, and it's not loading.
[469:15.80]I'm sitting here right now.
[469:17.06]I'm on a white screen.
[469:19.25]There's no data transferring.
[469:20.37]It's just sitting here.
[469:26.04]This happened last time.
[469:29.23]I'm going to make my own version of this.
[469:30.43]I'm going to make my own version of this.
[469:32.39]I'm going to make my own version.
[469:40.63]Yeah.
[469:40.79]I'm going to make my own.
[469:46.03]Please enable it.
[469:46.65]God, please.
[469:47.27]No, I'm going to make my own.
[469:47.95]It's going to be called Germapog.
[469:50.43]And I'm going to make sure it's going to get zoomed in and it'll be my mouth.
[469:54.26]You'll get it.
[469:56.31]We don't want to... No, we won't use it.
[469:58.58]Yeah, you will.
[470:00.78]It's going to be disgusting.
[470:01.78]It's going to be like a wicked zoomed in... You'll see.
[470:04.91]He'll use it.
[470:07.66]We want Pog.
[470:08.56]Alright, I'll give you Pog.
[470:10.22]Not tonight, though.
[470:11.72]Thanks for the $2.50.
[470:14.11]Produces Asan.
[470:15.99]Produces Asan.
[470:17.09]Thanks for the $500.
[470:17.89]I had the Lord of the Rings book as a kid.
[470:20.63]Never read them.
[470:21.41]The movies came out.
[470:22.35]Didn't watch them.
[470:23.13]The Hobbit films didn't came out.
[470:24.35]My friends gushed about the series.
[470:26.17]Didn't watch them.
[470:28.15]Vinny Vinesauce talks about and references the films constantly.
[470:32.11]Still wasn't interested, but you doing terribly at those PS2 games finally did it.
[470:36.53]And I watched them.
[470:37.84]So thanks, Jermo.
[470:39.16]Also, you pronounced my name Produce Sa-san.
[470:43.28]Thanks for making me laugh.
[470:46.90]Thank you, Produce Sa-san.

[470:51.70]Sure.
[470:52.92]Sprite is better than Coke.
[470:54.58]Buy Sprite.
[470:55.24]It's the best soda.
[470:56.34]It's the best better than Coke.

[471:00.51]Uh gtx 1080 quad sli.
[471:03.23]Thanks for the 250 Hey, Jeremy.
[471:06.21]I was just wondering do you have any hobbies?
[471:07.97]Also, have you considered doing a collaboration with rt game?
[471:10.91]You two seem like you get along super well and have a great stream Well, maybe I'll ask him maybe I'll ask him when I see him in person This weekend
[471:38.80]Pretty good timing on that Pretty good timing That's a spoiler Wait, how is that a spoiler?
[471:55.57]That person has inside information, they might
[471:59.22]Anyways.
[471:59.56]I'll just play Kingdom Hearts 2 and then get to that part and then stop playing.
[472:02.62]Also, do I have any hobbies from GTX 1080?
[472:03.72]Um...
[472:14.22]Yeah, playing games.
[472:15.48]I like... You know what one of my hobbies is?
[472:18.60]You're going to think I'm crazy.
[472:19.62]It's real.
[472:20.36]Taking baths.
[472:22.10]I love a good bath with bubbles.
[472:24.18]It's one of my hobbies.
[472:25.58]I take taking baths very seriously.
[472:27.46]I love it.
[472:29.20]Taking baths is actually a hobby.
[472:31.58]I like it.
[472:32.04]I do it all the time.
[472:35.85]It's a hobby.
[472:38.37]With Epsom salt?
[472:39.21]Oh, yep.
[472:39.71]Absolutely.
[472:40.91]Soak in there for a little bit of bath?
[472:42.17]That's not a hobby.
[472:43.33]Why not?
[472:46.86]One day I want to get a jacuzzi or something.
[472:49.31]And just have the ultimate bath.
[472:53.65]And finally we had, uh... Kyro... Ksyro, or Cryoburb.
[472:59.33]Thank you.
[472:59.79]I keep seeing everybody's names just wrong.
[473:02.62]Thank you for that.
[473:03.88]500 bits.
[473:05.40]As we make it to the end here.
[473:07.52]We're gonna go to the end.
[473:11.05]uh cryo burp thanks for 500 bits hey jerboa either one of either one or a few of your mods were going up the chat and manually timing people up for trying to help you read the 5k bits message before here's money towards funding programming to better teach them emotion they do their best yeah remember there's a lot of people here at this stream this stream has a shitload of people on it
[473:35.88]But it's still moderated enough, or we try to moderate it enough to not have, you know, spam or anything crazy or anything fucking bad or people saying bad shit.
[473:48.46]It's tough sometimes.
[473:49.56]I mean, there was 7,000 people here today.
[473:54.66]They're doing their best to manage it with the guidelines that are here.
[474:00.65]And I've talked about this before, you go, no mods, or mods, or a really, really, really tightly moderated stream, but sub only always, and a ton, ton of rules that you have to follow, or you're out of here.
[474:13.70]A lot of people do it like that.
[474:15.22]Or, just open the floodgates and who gives a fuck.
[474:18.52]I'm, I don't like that either.
[474:20.16]So, I try to keep it somewhere in the middle.
[474:23.56]I try to.
[474:24.94]It can be hard.
[474:27.61]It's very difficult to have the level of freedom that I want without it getting too over-moderated or too under-moderated.
[474:39.72]It can be tricky.
[474:43.40]Sub only sucks.
[474:44.30]That's why I don't do it that way.
[474:45.42]I don't do sub only mode really ever.
[474:47.46]Only when I have to or when something crazy is going on or if I want to avoid a spoiler for a game or something.
[474:52.17]I don't use it.
[474:56.45]But they try... We have meetings where the mod teams, once every three or four months, will get together and just talk about, hey, this is kind of what I want to have happen.
[475:07.37]Hey, what's happened here?
[475:08.33]Why did this happen?
[475:09.39]Something wrong here?
[475:10.90]When somebody got banned?
[475:12.58]We talk about shit all the time.
[475:13.76]We really do.
[475:14.30]Mod meetings.
[475:16.06]Well, technically, that's what you call them.
[475:17.58]Is there a problem, officer?
[475:23.36]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[475:24.62]We had one more bit come in from Opster Narwhal Lover.
[475:28.43]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[475:30.83]He said, Hey Jerma, I made the original Jerma Auto emote and you may have seen it.
[475:33.87]It's gone.
[475:35.13]I replaced it with this one if you want to add it.
[475:41.08]Oh, shit.
[475:41.62]Yeah, let's get it.
[475:42.46]Alright, let's add it.
[475:53.88]Alright, click this.
[475:54.74]Click this.
[475:58.79]Alright, let's go.
[475:59.19]Here we go.

[476:04.71]It'll be available in about two minutes.
[476:08.11]Is it there?
[476:16.34]Here it comes.
[476:17.36]Might have to refresh, yeah.
[476:18.90]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow at one o'clock o'clock
[476:23.95]Tomorrow's stream is going to be fairly short.
[476:27.50]Have a great rest of your night.

[476:32.98]We'll do a little bit of community content stuff tomorrow.
