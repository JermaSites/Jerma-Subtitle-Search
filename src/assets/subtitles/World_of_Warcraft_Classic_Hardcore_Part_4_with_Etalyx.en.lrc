[ve:61.1.100]

[00:06.92]Yeah, now we're going to get back to some WoW.
[00:11.50]I don't know how much longer I'm going to stream for, but I will at least for at least the next couple of hours, probably.
[00:20.49]So I am now officially in Only Fangs.
[00:23.17]I'm in the guild.
[00:27.61]I was at the guild meeting today.
[00:32.32]I have the add-on installed from here on out.
[00:36.36]I will tell you, I cannot, I cannot trade with anybody.
[00:41.75]I can't use the auction house.
[00:42.89]I can't take anything from anyone unless they are also in Only Fangs.
[00:48.57]There's a lot of streamers that are in Only Fangs.
[00:51.55]I'm imagining, depending on how long I want to do this for, we'll probably come across quite a few streamers.
[00:58.68]Some of which you know, some of which you maybe you don't know.
[01:02.55]But that's the way it's going to be.
[01:05.69]I'm committed to playing with guildies.
[01:09.15]Part of the rules to being in the guild is you have to prioritize guildmates first.
[01:15.22]And that's questing and leveling and dungeons.
[01:20.74]So there's a lot of streamers here.
[01:23.66]Some of them I do know.
[01:24.44]Some I don't.
[01:25.54]Some I've interacted with.
[01:26.42]Some I've interacted with in passing.
[01:28.38]But I'm just here.
[01:30.03]I'm just chilling.
[01:30.49]It'll be fine.
[01:36.34]Okay, so let me... Where am I?
[01:43.66]What am I doing here?
[01:47.83]There we go.
[01:48.51]Hey, hello.
[01:56.11]You're still going to stream?
[01:58.30]Yeah.
[02:00.48]I want to get to level 18.
[02:01.78]So I got to get one full level.
[02:09.23]Can you guys hear the audio good too?
[02:13.19]Okay, there you can hear it.
[02:17.59]Level 18.
[02:18.15]You should turn on looping music.
[02:25.92]I will.
[02:30.70]Base cam or we're going to riot.
[02:33.54]How about this?
[02:35.06]How about I...
[02:40.16]uh how about we cash in one chat face cam token uh next weekend I will play a few horror games how's that sound I've wanted to do a an itch.io horror kind of game night again because those are always so fun
[03:07.92]Just grab one, play it for 30 minutes.
[03:10.81]Grab one, play it 30 minutes.
[03:11.99]Grab one, play it 30 minutes.
[03:16.53]I've wanted to do that for a little while now, so... So we'll plan that maybe for like next weekend.
[03:23.98]Alright, so I want to go... What was I doing?
[03:33.42]There's a lot of stuff going on here.
[03:40.23]What is... Wailing Caverns is what?
[03:46.13]17 to 24.
[03:47.29]Probably should be 20 to 21 to do Wailing Caverns.
[03:57.85]Glad you're just streaming on your own terms now.
[03:59.53]These are chill.
[04:02.09]Yeah, I... You want... This is... You want something crazy?
[04:05.92]I've probably streamed more in the last five, six days than I probably have in three years.
[04:13.42]It's just going to be whatever it is.
[04:14.72]If that's Nancy Drew for three hours and then wow, or if that's, you know, whatever it is.
[04:18.45]Uh, so I was given these.
[04:38.33]These are 14 slot bags.
[04:40.87]I got these from the guild.
[04:43.13]This is, I didn't, this is not cheating.
[04:46.31]But I am not going to use them.
[04:48.95]I want the struggle a little bit.
[04:51.12]So every 10 levels I will unlock being able to use one of these.
[05:02.02]So one of them has been unlocked because I got to level 10.
[05:06.72]The other ones I'm going to store in the bank.
[05:10.20]So every 10 levels I will use another one of these.
[05:14.38]Because I kind of like the struggle.
[05:17.02]There's a lot of shit in here that I don't care about, is there?
[05:27.66]Very acceptable.
[05:28.36]The council is watching.
[05:32.88]I bet you get full inventory once and then just say fuck it and equip them.
[05:37.85]Yeah, that's okay.
[05:39.80]All right, so you're supposed to prioritize guildies, right?
[05:45.34]Should I see if anybody wants this?
[05:47.12]Is that stupid?
[05:49.28]Does anybody in this guild want a level 5 green axe?
[05:52.29]No way.
[05:52.65]Oh, I can learn this.
[06:02.83]Maybe?
[06:03.15]Maybe?
[06:04.63]Should I type in the guild and just say, hey, does anybody want this?
[06:07.25]I'm going to get like, fucking, people are going to be like, no.
[06:11.01]Should I?
[06:11.37]It's going to look so stupid, isn't it?
[06:16.05]Hey, anyone need this?
[06:24.47]Does this look stupid?
[06:37.63]I got a yes, please.
[06:40.83]That's legal eagle.
[06:42.33]Legal eagle needs this.
[06:45.07]All right.
[06:47.01]Nice.
[06:49.36]Should I mail it?
[06:53.98]Can mail or whatever is easier.
[07:00.40]You in town?
[07:10.47]Look at this.
[07:10.79]I'm already interacting.
[07:16.75]Oh, yeah.
[07:17.43]All right.
[07:19.07]All right.
[07:19.51]Let's send legal eagle this axe.
[07:24.91]Cool.
[07:25.38]Oh, this is fun.
[07:26.12]All right.
[07:30.38]How do I do this?
[07:33.20]Oh, my God.
[07:33.64]I have a lot of mail.
[07:34.52]Okay.
[07:35.86]Send mail to legal eagle.
[07:40.84]And the subject is Sweet Axe.
[07:46.52]Level 5.
[07:49.88]Oh, what if I send a bonus axe?
[07:54.48]Watch this.
[08:07.91]There you go.
[08:08.35]Hit me with the bonus axe.
[08:14.30]Alright, then send, right?
[08:17.48]And send five silver, too.
[08:19.22]Alright, yeah.
[08:19.78]Ten silver.
[08:25.12]And some cash.
[08:26.94]And what else?
[08:27.44]Do I have any more axes?
[08:35.74]This is... Don't send that much money?
[08:37.56]Alright, here we go.
[08:40.76]It worked!
[08:44.82]Look, I'm being helpful.
[08:49.62]Wait, what about some other things I have?
[08:58.41]Dude, I got like a wand too.
[09:03.92]Although I kind of, I might want this if I make a priest.
[09:09.71]Yeah, if I make a priest, I kind of want to hold on to these.
[09:12.79]But I can't make another character until I get to level 60, apparently.
[09:15.29]I didn't send him any money.
[09:32.36]it said there was money that's like getting the birthday card that says oh sweetie here's fifty dollars and make sure yeah there's just nothing in the envelope it's like oh grandma you forgot to put the money in there it sounds like oh it sounds like I'm looking for money oh shit I have to like should I send another message and say hey uh uh whatever it doesn't matter
[10:02.95]I'm so, like, fucked up around other people.
[10:05.23]What's wrong with me?
[10:05.97]Alright, I'm gonna go to the crossroads.
[10:24.19]Send mail again and say, I forgot the money.
[10:26.17]But then, but I don't, but should I send...
[10:35.88]I'm just going to let it be a mystery.
[10:37.00]It's fine.
[10:37.38]Alright, I need to fly somewhere.
[10:50.53]I'm going to be taking a break in a second here anyways before I really get started.
[10:54.47]I'm going to feed Otto.
[10:58.58]Into the crossroads.
[11:12.58]Have you dreamt of the orb yet?
[11:15.30]Not since last time, no.
[11:20.50]I did have a dream about feeding Otto carrots though, which I don't, I don't know what that was about, but that was a nice dream.
[11:38.23]Ever watch the X-Files?
[11:39.29]I have watched X-Files.
[11:41.09]I don't remember anything about it.
[11:41.97]I just remember watching it.
[11:52.86]Have you seen Twin Peaks?
[11:54.16]Because that dream was out of... No, I've never seen that show.
[12:09.21]I'm going to hit you with the bonus axe and cash.
[12:13.50]Odd.
[12:21.38]It's overrated.
[12:21.96]Okay, Twin Peaks.
[12:25.19]That show, I have heard...
[12:29.32]an equal amount of people tell me to play it, and an equal amount of people... Play it.
[12:33.39]Watch it.
[12:34.65]An equal amount of people have been like, it's overrated.
[12:36.51]Don't watch it.
[12:37.21]And then it's 50% like you should play it.
[12:40.11]Why do I keep saying play it?
[12:41.75]Nancy Drew fried my brain.
[12:55.74]Throw a poll in the chat and be honest.
[12:59.02]Is Twin Peaks a show that you should actually watch?
[13:02.24]Or nah, skip it.
[13:04.88]Actually, I'm very curious about what people say about this.
[13:07.82]Whoa, wait a minute.
[13:16.78]Whoa, look at this.
[13:18.92]It says who needs it.
[13:24.00]Because I have the add-on.
[13:25.16]That's kind of cool.
[13:26.65]So I just send it to people?
[13:36.12]Let me see, Twinfeigs.
[13:44.03]A lot of no opinions, which is interesting.
[13:54.62]A lot of watch it, a lot of no opinion.
[14:02.90]The Zoomer audience hasn't seen it yet.
[14:16.18]How many?
[14:16.50]Was it a long show?
[14:17.58]How many episodes are there?
[14:25.84]Yeah.
[14:26.50]What do you need?
[14:27.46]You hungry?
[14:28.80]I think he's hungry.
[14:29.38]Yeah.
[14:32.30]All right, I'm going to take a kind of a longer break because I want to feed him and take care of him.
[14:37.92]And then I'm going to get a drink.
[14:39.16]I'm going to stretch and stuff after the Nancy Drew shenanigans.
[14:45.07]And then I'm going to come back and we'll play for probably a couple of hours, two or three hours, maybe.
[14:53.19]So I'll be right back.
[14:55.21]Maybe five to six minutes.
[15:02.97]They rebooted it as well.
[15:05.65]Rebooted it?
[15:07.15]When did it come out?
[15:07.77]I thought it was like 10 years ago.
[15:10.73]Was it more than 5 to 10 years ago?
[15:17.93]30 years ago?
[15:19.14]What?
[15:19.40]How did I... I'm a... I grew up in the 90s.
[15:22.32]How have I never even heard of this?
[15:24.22]I mean, I've heard of it, but never really cared to watch it or anything.
[15:26.24]That's weird.
[15:28.41]All right, I'll be back.
[15:30.13]Let's call it like six or seven minutes.
[15:31.99]It's going to be an extended break.
[15:33.35]Ads are going to play in a few minutes or so, maybe two minutes from now.
[15:37.93]The BRB will be up though.
[15:38.97]So I'll be back.
[15:40.39]I'm going to get some food too.
[15:41.62]You know what?
[15:41.90]Might as well lock in.
[15:44.92]I'll be right back, guys.
[15:47.08]See you soon.
[16:16.67]Okay.
[18:44.88]you
[19:45.97]Thank you.
[21:12.62]you
[22:13.23]Thank you.
[23:40.27]Thank you.
[24:50.38]Currently eating a little bit.
[24:53.32]Figured.
[24:55.56]Why not just eat?
[24:58.68]Because that's always the problem with, you know, back in the day.
[25:03.48]I would always I just wouldn't eat and that's why you know after four five six hours seven hours it's like okay I gotta I gotta eat something I always hated eating on stream but you know what whatever let's just do it who cares then I can refresh a little bit sit back down
[25:26.57]Also too with the ads playing during the BRBs.
[25:30.05]I feel like people dip out too for a little bit like I'm going to grab something or you checking over another stream out.
[25:37.43]By the time you come back, it won't be a pre-roll.
[25:40.86]I was just thinking about that.
[25:42.94]Hopefully that's helpful.
[25:58.76]I just did that.
[25:59.68]We're good.
[26:05.78]It's actually been very helpful for me.
[26:08.29]I know, I want to say like a month ago.
[26:11.29]Started this experiment of trying to do these ads every hour.
[26:15.01]And yeah, when you do three minutes or four minutes of ads an hour, you get no pre-rolls and then and it makes money too.
[26:23.54]So.
[26:24.98]It's an excuse to get up.
[26:26.46]It's an excuse for me to move around.
[26:28.72]I think it's good.
[26:43.06]I used to sit... I would get up and my legs would just be like the Tin Man.
[26:49.35]Sometimes I wouldn't get up for four or five hours.
[26:51.15]And even still, sometimes it still happens.
[26:58.05]I look over and it's like, oh shit, wait, it's been like two and a half hours.
[27:00.01]Now we're saying we play with other people.
[27:03.37]There's other stuff going on.
[27:04.73]You can't, you know, I'm not just gonna be like, hold on everybody.
[27:07.83]Pause for five minutes.
[27:09.49]I'll be back.
[27:10.45]We're in the middle of a fucking dungeon.
[27:12.82]No, that's not gonna happen.
[27:28.19]make them stretch too dude this guy just loves talking about ad breaks well I don't want to be a fucking dickhead about it let me be honest this channel is over 15 years the youtube channel had ads right because that's they would play in the beginning
[28:04.16]But on Twitch, no, I never really ever did it.
[28:12.88]Is it too inefficient?
[28:13.62]No, it is the turkey sandwich.
[28:17.36]It's turkey, provolone, lettuce, tomato, a little bit of balsamic and a little bit of oil.
[28:26.37]Very good.
[28:38.23]Yeah, it's great.
[28:49.49]Turn the cam on.
[28:50.20]I want to see you chew.
[28:54.90]Homemade or from a place?
[28:57.16]Usually it's 50-50.
[28:59.24]If I get the deli meat.
[29:01.24]But this one, this is from a deli.
[29:03.32]This is from a... This place is great.
[29:05.18]I've been obsessed with this place for a while.
[29:09.14]It's like three or four places that I get sandwiches like this from.
[29:18.15]Jimmy John's did away with the brand-named mustard.
[29:20.65]What?
[29:28.05]50-50?
[29:28.25]Yeah, usually.
[29:28.79]I mean, I make about half the sandwiches I eat.
[29:31.83]I eat a lot.
[29:32.49]I'm a sandwich guy, though.
[29:34.07]Sandwich is probably my favorite food.
[29:42.38]Favorite sandwich of all time.
[29:43.88]If you count a buffalo finger sub with blue cheese and provolone cheese on it.
[29:50.01]Toasted.
[29:52.75]It's got to be the right buffalo sub though.
[29:55.27]None of this grilled chicken with Frank's Red Hot.
[29:57.53]No, no, no.
[29:58.99]Not grilled chicken with Frank's Red Hot.
[30:01.52]Delete that.
[30:02.10]Get it out of here.
[30:07.70]I'm talking thin cutlets.
[30:10.37]And you know when they're done right.
[30:12.55]Thin chicken cutlets.
[30:15.39]And like a nice house-made sauce.
[30:18.05]Nice house-made buffalo sauce.
[30:22.26]With blue cheese and provolone cheese on it.
[30:40.75]Yeah, not even tenders, though.
[30:43.89]I mean, I did say, I did, I did say buffalo finger.
[30:46.03]I should have said buffalo, um, like chicken cutlet.
[30:50.71]Buffalo sub.
[30:53.53]Those are good.
[30:53.91]A buffalo finger sub is amazing, too.
[30:59.39]But yeah, buffalo chicken's like one of my favorite foods ever.
[31:01.02]I can't really eat it that much anymore, though.
[31:04.20]Um, I've had some pretty annoying digestive problems, as you guys know, but more recently, too.
[31:12.32]I can't just pound buffalo chicken subs anymore.
[31:15.18]Trying to be a little healthier.
[31:17.93]Really am.
[31:30.70]Mild buffalo sauce.
[31:31.52]It really is kind of any.
[31:36.54]Rooibos sub.
[31:38.26]Just put rooibos tea leaves in bread.
[31:42.90]A rooibos buffalo sub.
[31:45.62]Oh, that's disgusting.
[32:03.43]How much fiber is in my diet?
[32:04.75]I get it.
[32:05.37]I've been pretty good about it.
[32:07.70]I drink those Olipops.
[32:11.47]I tried taking a lot more oats the last like six months or so.
[32:15.83]Not too, too much.
[32:16.55]And if you, by the way, if you're going to drink those Olipops or those kind of fiber drinks, fiber sodas, though, drinking more than one or two of those a day, be very careful if you're going to do that.
[32:29.06]Those things have 30 to 40% of your entire daily value of fiber for the whole day in one can.
[32:49.52]I love those things, though.
[32:50.28]They're amazing.
[32:55.74]Root beer, Olipop.
[32:56.49]Yeah, root beer is great.
[32:58.31]I like the cola one, too.
[32:59.29]The vintage cola one.
[33:02.13]It tastes kind of weird, but I like it.
[33:04.21]Alright, I'm going to throw this and clean up a little bit.
[33:09.01]I'll be back in one minute.
[33:31.20]Thank you.
[34:32.48]So,
[35:35.86]Just grabbed a handful of Cheez-Its.
[35:39.32]And I'm good.
[35:43.24]Okay, good.
[35:45.90]Let's do it.
[35:46.28]Let me go like this.
[35:52.26]What do I have on my screen?
[36:03.28]And Cheez-Its.
[36:04.46]Yeah.
[36:15.64]I think.
[36:17.32]There was a lot of stuff that we were doing here.
[36:20.46]Harpy lieutenants.
[36:22.58]Raptor horns.
[36:26.23]Raptor horns.
[36:27.85]I'm going to go turn this in.
[36:28.59]Let me see.
[36:31.43]Let me see what Italic is up to.
[36:33.39]Hey, what's up?
[36:39.15]I, um, and I'm writing the ums by the way, said, um, it was gonna be, um, two hours.
[36:53.65]Um, it was four and a half.
[36:57.75]It was four to five.
[36:58.91]Uh, okay.
[37:13.19]Oh, that's beautiful.
[37:14.67]Look at that.
[37:16.77]Wow.
[37:17.33]Now that's a desktop background.
[37:21.96]If I've ever seen one.
[37:35.01]Bro, why are you still in the Barrens?
[37:36.39]I just got here.
[37:43.71]What's this one?
[37:44.29]Silithid eggs?
[38:20.65]He said, I've been roleplaying.
[38:23.58]Okay.
[38:28.56]You want a quest in like now?
[38:34.94]Plenty of stuff to do.
[38:51.31]Oh, he's in the inn.
[39:02.63]Hello, hello.
[39:03.19]Oh, hello.
[39:04.63]How's it going?
[39:07.45]Pretty good.
[39:08.17]Did you solve the ghost murder?
[39:10.25]I did.
[39:10.79]It was very, very interesting.
[39:14.05]It was a bunch of clocks at the end.
[39:15.53]I don't know if you saw the clock part, but it was very intense.
[39:21.81]I did not see the clocks, but I did see... I tried to help with the sliding puzzle.
[39:28.39]Oh my god, I wanted to fucking... I wanted to fucking puke, dude.
[39:33.74]I hate sliding puzzles.
[39:34.42]I was using the, uh... one-bar Neuralink... proximity signal to try to, like, willpower you to move specific blocks, and it worked.
[39:47.29]Like as soon as they started like saying out loud what the solution was, you started to solve it.
[39:54.19]I don't know what was going on with those clocks.
[39:55.94]Because there's like three or four solutions that were going to work.
[39:59.28]It just... I don't get it.
[40:02.98]The one at the very end just seemed to not want to work.
[40:09.20]It kept being wrong.
[40:10.12]750, 755, 8, 805.
[40:15.42]I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, this is not an insult, but I wouldn't describe you as someone who typically gravitates toward puzzle games.
[40:27.69]Would you, would you agree or disagree with that?
[40:32.50]I just like uninvited you and ran away making a funny joke.
[40:37.22]Uh, no, I'm not a puzzle.
[40:39.18]Okay.
[40:39.42]I like, I like watching other people do puzzles.
[40:46.24]But when I have to be the one that actually makes the decisions and makes the true puzzles, I- I- I'm not a- I can't do it.
[40:53.60]What he's trying to say, chat, is you don't know shit.
[40:55.28]Okay, it's hard being the one who's being watched doing the puzzles.
[41:03.28]I would- I would seriously love if I could release my cursor to somebody in chat.
[41:10.51]Just somebody.
[41:11.15]Just be like, hey, just take it.
[41:12.09]I'm- I'm gonna watch you.
[41:14.75]then if somebody gets it wrong then we can all be like oh but you go look at you screwed that up you said you could do it and we can all laugh at you now that'd be pretty funny I didn't say you were bad at puzzle games I just said that like if if I was like hey dude you got to play this new game you'd be like what kind of game is it and I was like it's a puzzle game you wouldn't be like yes yeah that's true I would not like that would not that would not be a selling point
[41:42.11]What is a selling point for me?
[41:44.37]Dodge rolls?
[41:46.15]Upgrades?
[41:46.69]It can be played on your iPad.
[41:48.69]That's also true.
[41:55.26]Driving a car.
[41:57.06]Car accidents.
[42:02.44]You want to go up to the summer flange stuff?
[42:07.73]Oh, yeah.
[42:07.99]I got to get to 18.
[42:08.77]Northeast?
[42:10.25]I think it's straight up.
[42:11.63]Oh, I've got some shit for you.
[42:12.92]I don't know... Two things.
[42:14.38]Number one.
[42:15.58]Do you have the add-on?
[42:17.18]I do.
[42:18.92]Okay.
[42:19.82]Because you are not on the map.
[42:22.26]Like, you don't... You're not on, like, my mini-map, like all the other guildies.
[42:26.24]Oh.
[42:28.76]Um... I got the manda... I think that... I don't know if that one's mandatory.
[42:32.01]I only got the mandatory ones today.
[42:35.61]Uh, but... I have some stuff.
[42:37.77]I don't know what people have already given you, but I just... I was...
[42:40.98]chilling on my main earlier and uh made some alchemist potions and stuff oh I'll take potions for sure uh I was given four 14 slot bags but I have uh nerfed them on purpose I'm only allowed to use them every five to ten levels this is your busy oh I have them all turned off
[43:09.84]What did you say about limiting yourself for what?
[43:12.86]I just said because I still want the struggle.
[43:15.86]So I'm only going to allow my... Ooh.
[43:19.60]Ooh.
[43:22.44]Ooh.
[43:29.83]I sent Legal Eagle two axes and said I was going to send him money, but I just didn't send him any money.
[43:35.62]also um I just holy shit these are amazing I want chat to know this is just I was clearing space in my guild tab today because I or my bank tab so this is all extra shit I'll take your extra shit this is this stuff is life-saving and I think I have some potions oh here actually here let me let me let me let me give you some you don't have to pay we're in the same guild now you don't have this is you don't have to pay money
[44:05.04]Yeah, but I did death roll you for at least 20 of this.
[44:07.98]This is a refund.
[44:09.95]You can say this as a refund.
[44:13.91]I'm trying to clear bag space.
[44:19.13]Oh, hell yeah.
[44:19.71]All right.
[44:25.83]Definitely going to put these on the bar.
[44:28.31]Oh, cool.
[44:28.82]It's already there.
[44:34.37]Elixir of Wisdom.
[44:35.51]These are good too.
[44:37.20]But yeah, when I was getting an invite for this character into the guild, they were like, okay, so you never used the auction house on that character and you never took any items from outside the guild, right?
[44:49.63]And I was like, yeah, I never used the auction house, but I did trade Jerma.
[44:55.69]And they were like, wait a second, you traded Jerma?
[44:59.22]I was like, yeah, but it was just greens that I found while we were questing.
[45:02.04]He's like, okay, well, if you got anything else, delete it.
[45:03.90]And I was like, oh, shit.
[45:08.15]Okay, I got some potions on.
[45:09.91]I didn't know it was that serious, man.
[45:15.17]Hey, you got to play by the rules.
[45:16.35]We got to play by the rules.
[45:17.27]That's why I had to get rid of those bags that were given to me.
[45:21.36]Yeah, but did you not just get them auto-upgraded by other people in the guild who sent you better ones?
[45:28.58]uh yeah I'm good though I got I got 14 slot but that was from somebody in the guild yeah well they didn't go hey italics is in the guild better send that guy 14 slot bags did they oh but I like to struggle
[45:59.15]I only have one of them equipped I only have one equipped I have one look at this I'm talking about myself oh no I actually did buy you can like put them on the wish list and stuff this is really cool though the fact that it shows what who wants certain things yeah okay how do you that's cool you have to uh type it in
[46:20.68]so you can you can just like write what people people have already sent me stuff like uh people sent me like uh training dummies you could put like a schematic recipe uh people often wish for the pages you know how you have to some of the quests are like gather the pages to make the chapters for uh the ashen veil quest oh that's right those things are annoying
[46:50.08]You gotta get, like, what?
[46:51.32]Is it nine pages?
[46:52.26]There's, like, a cover, too, right?
[46:54.06]I think it's, um... I think it's nine pages, and you have to, like, group them up into chapters.
[46:58.48]It's either nine or twelve.
[47:01.90]We missed Ren.
[47:02.68]Oh, no, we already have it.
[47:04.91]We did get Ren.
[47:05.93]I heard there was Onyxia dropping, if we wanted that, but I don't care either way.
[47:17.63]Onyxia.
[47:21.93]Oh, yeah.
[47:22.85]How do I save the chat bubbles?
[47:29.13]Options?
[47:29.75]If you just options and search chat in the top right box, it's the first option.
[47:35.13]Oh.
[47:37.77]You guys are getting hidden.
[47:38.68]Exclude party chat?
[47:42.20]What do you have on?
[47:42.94]It's probably all.
[47:43.98]I mean, I had it on, but I'm not normally flanked with an entourage.
[47:51.18]I'll turn them off for now.
[47:59.91]Yeah, we can only trade with people in the guild.
[48:03.99]And the theory with that was... Yeah, somebody's saying in the chat right now, it's like more fun to not have people just, oh, hey, here's like 500 gold and a ton of items and right at level one or it just makes it at least... Oh, I thought that was a people.
[48:20.51]Makes it a little bit more interesting.
[48:23.27]It's kind of like a, almost like a guild self found in a way.
[48:28.55]yeah and they they almost enabled the auction house but I guess it like by a narrow margin uh stayed banned for now but they're making some exceptions I think yeah I mean uh blackwing lair I don't think it's even announced yet like I don't even know it's not even out I don't nobody even knows when it's coming out I think it's gonna be at least a few weeks before it's out potentially so nobody even knows when that's coming
[49:01.38]Actually, I did have some guildies offer some bags, but I didn't take them at first.
[49:07.67]And I, you know what?
[49:08.77]I'm not trying to flex here, but I bought them myself.
[49:12.07]Just kidding.
[49:12.55]On this character, I actually got way luckier than you and had four bags drop in the starter area.
[49:22.43]That's actually awesome.
[49:26.39]Oh, I did bring up the 39 priests and me in a raid.
[49:32.51]No, I caught up on the guild meeting earlier.
[49:35.03]I watched it before I started.
[49:37.95]So they said it was a possibility, huh?
[49:40.79]Like a real possibility?
[49:43.79]I mean, are there even 39 priests in the guild?
[49:47.79]Oh, this quest normally sucks, by the way, but it should be fine with this many people.
[49:53.01]Oh, can I give you one of these?
[49:54.45]Can I give you one of these bags?
[49:56.13]I can give you one, right?
[49:58.60]If you want to.
[49:59.91]Yeah, you can have one.
[50:01.17]I can't do it right now.
[50:01.83]It's in the bank, but... These things are lower.
[50:07.21]I gotta get my Voidwalker.
[50:22.42]Yeah, this place does spawn like five things, but we're fine.
[50:28.53]we're also five levels higher than everything here so three four at least yeah I think if you get the close the valves that's the one that spawns all the shit I want to play a priest though I do then you can multi-box and heal yourself in the raid
[51:04.52]How come there's a checkbox next to you in your title which says level 19?
[51:07.74]Because that's a goal for the day.
[51:09.96]That's my checklist for the day.
[51:13.92]I did one of those.
[51:14.62]I beat Nancy Drew.
[51:15.47]Now I'm going to get to level 19.
[51:20.21]Maybe.
[51:28.33]Look, I'll turn it into a red X if I don't get to 19.
[51:30.20]Okay.
[51:49.42]Oh, by the way, I was sitting... Alright, how many times did you do this?
[51:54.08]How many times did you open up the WoWhead talent calculator for the class you are currently playing?
[51:59.97]Is it less or more than 50 times?
[52:01.97]Uh, like for the character I'm playing right now?
[52:05.63]Yeah, just like, or in general.
[52:07.37]How long, how many hours would you say have you spent off-stream, I'm saying, just like kind of in your own time, just looking at the talent calculator, like in bed?
[52:18.64]in bed uh never well at your desk um I I you're putting me on the spot here because confession I looked up builds and picked the second one and just am following that oh no there's no judgment there
[52:39.98]because Warrior has, like, one build for leveling.
[52:44.61]You put five points into Cruelty, the rest in Arms.
[52:48.21]There's not a lot of room for creativity here.
[52:51.39]Different classes, I feel like, have way more choices.
[52:57.63]I think all the Warlock ones are viable, but Destruction, I think, is the worst one.
[53:02.95]And it's not because it's a bad spec, it's just because I think it's mainly a PvP-oriented spec.
[53:13.82]you kind of have to use the calculator because if you want to respec it costs you a bunch of gold doesn't it yeah the first respect is I think cheap then every time you do it after it wait somebody wants these oh for a second I thought somebody wanted them in the guild I was like who wants did you use the console again a second time I did yeah this is the boss over here right hold on yeah I gotta do it it doubles every after one gold
[53:45.34]oh we gotta save this dude's life are we in trouble?
[53:54.76]well they were they were pretty low but they're good there's just a hyperspawns going on over here every time somebody touches one of those knobs
[54:18.08]What's the name of the quest we're supposed to have?
[54:20.62]It's a named guy in here.
[54:22.04]His name is... It's the console key.
[54:24.89]It's called Samuflange.
[54:25.89]I think it's a person in here that spawns.
[54:45.04]Why are we in slow mode?
[54:46.60]Oh, I think I told Moz to put it in slow mode because I was freaking out about one of those puzzles and it was making me crazy.
[54:58.73]We usually have slow mode on here though.
[55:03.19]You don't want chat to get too comfortable.
[55:13.22]Not having slow mode is like kicking your feet up, put them on the coffee table.
[55:16.64]You know what I mean?
[55:17.06]Like you need to sit with a little respect.
[55:19.23]Do you want to try to layer?
[55:20.95]This might be difficult.
[55:23.93]It's probably for the best.
[55:25.43]This might be difficult.
[55:26.49]There are at least... There's a lot of people here.
[55:29.64]And I think a few people are here actually waiting for it as well.
[55:32.26]All right, let's layer.
[55:44.62]Anybody got a layer?
[55:48.32]You can actually just ask in guild chat, and they will do it.
[55:50.84]Oh.
[55:52.35]Well, I think I just got one.
[55:53.97]It helps if you know what layer you're already on, so you could be like, someone layer me off of whatever.
[56:00.05]Oh, okay, cool.
[56:04.54]Just be careful layering.
[56:05.83]You're right in the middle of enemy territory, bro.
[56:08.41]Oh my god, I am.
[56:10.45]Well, you're about to be too.
[56:12.17]Well, I'm moving out of the way first.
[56:15.07]I just saw you vanish before my eyes.
[56:16.99]I'm alright.
[56:19.01]They're 14, 13.
[56:19.49]We're good.
[56:20.49]Could probably aggro two or three of these and be fine.
[56:30.34]Thank you, Freakus.
[56:32.16]Yeah, thank you very, very much.
[56:37.42]and he's not here but there's nobody else fight a couple dudes oh also I just got a two-handed axe skill so I'm trying to level it up are you gonna go for the uh what's it the whirlwind axe that would be sick but it just so happens that the axe I have right now is like 40 better than the sword that I had in the dungeon last night or the day before
[57:06.78]hmm when can you get the word was it 30 I think it's all 30. I think it's around 30 yeah it's that's scary though that is a terrifying thing to have to do fighting an elite by yourself doing the jumping and throwing action oh yeah it's like yeah you have to be like alone right I think they have guild rules where you cannot have help fighting it either yeah I saw uh I saw tyler one do it it was so nerve-wracking
[57:48.43]It's a level 40 elite, yeah.
[57:49.88]And you can do the quest at level 30, which is why it's so awesome to do it.
[57:53.34]Because you get an axe that lasts you... It's a blue axe that lasts you at least 10 levels.
[57:57.74]Because the quest is a level 40 quest, which is crazy.
[58:03.08]And there's a... For those who don't know what we're talking about, there's a cheese strat to kill this thing.
[58:07.64]Usually, it's a very, very difficult elite enemy.
[58:09.99]But if you bring it into the water, there's a river that goes down.
[58:13.73]And you have to get in this weird...
[58:17.69]If you're in the water, he's, oh, I'm coming at you.
[58:19.89]But if you jump out of the water, he's like, oh, I don't remember that you were there.
[58:22.99]And then when you get back in the water, hey, I'm going to go come after you.
[58:25.51]And then when you, oh, I'm going to leave.
[58:27.17]And you have to throw axes for like 10 minutes at it.
[58:37.15]By the way, this guy you're waiting for has like a 10 minute respawn.
[58:40.05]What?
[58:40.37]Oh my God.
[58:40.93]Maybe we should just leave.
[58:43.33]It's, uh, I remember it being a pretty good quest chain though.
[58:46.76]give it 30 seconds do you have an active quest now or do you pick it up off of his body I have console key says tinkerer sniggles is the character's name why do I not maybe I didn't like accept it off of the thing over here I think if you go touch the console again
[59:23.00]There we go.
[59:35.90]Hey, there is, uh, we probably didn't.
[59:37.36]This person is probably looking forward to go ahead and tag first.
[59:44.04]Wouldn't want this person to sit here for 10 minutes like we just did.
[59:47.10]What about there's one more person?
[59:48.36]One more person.
[59:49.52]Get this other person.
[59:50.09]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[59:51.21]Take it.
[59:55.53]Hopefully they got it.
[59:59.74]Very nice.
[60:00.20]Okay.
[60:04.46]They may have no idea why they're here.
[60:07.58]But they completed the quest all the same.
[60:22.84]It's always fun when you get a random invite.
[60:30.99]Let's go back to Ratchet.
[60:31.89]That's a pretty good shield.
[60:34.34]There might be... We could probably, like, while we're up here, we could start doing Harpies.
[60:41.48]yeah we can either go top right this place sucks ass though I'm okay with completely skipping this area it's horrible which one the top right where the um cat's eye emerald and then there is the mechanic place with all the buckets and that place is hard I hate that place it's not too bad if we're not under leveled but we can do harpies northwest yeah let's do harpies
[61:08.61]Since we're kind of already up there anyway.
[61:09.91]Yeah, the drop rate sucks too.
[61:11.74]It's awful.
[61:14.62]I think I was just super lucky with all the, like, rare drop ones.
[61:20.82]I really didn't have to grind any of them out.
[61:23.05]Like, uh, the one that we did, like, a few days ago inside of Skull Rock.
[61:28.11]I actually completed that one without ever going inside Skull Rock.
[61:33.52]There was, like, one of the Arugal faction guys in an unrelated area, and I unknowingly killed him, and he dropped the insignia.
[61:43.51]First try.
[61:46.95]There you are, Mr. One in a Thousand.
[61:48.83]That's you.
[61:51.59]It cuts both ways.
[62:02.07]Yeah, we'll do Wailing Caverns.
[62:03.59]I think we're a little low for that.
[62:05.11]I think especially the tank should be somewhere around, what, 22?
[62:10.38]Yeah, that's like 20 at least.
[62:20.14]Does it feel good to actually be in the guild now?
[62:23.72]Yeah.
[62:24.66]Get the proper welcome and the support structure.
[62:31.58]I feel very plugged into the matrix right now.
[62:33.52]I feel like plugged in.
[62:41.53]I like how you join the guild and the very first thing they say is, all right, um, so we're going to have you raid lead if you want, if you want to, you know, just like they're raving.
[62:53.69]There's keep dying.
[62:55.21]So it's just like, I would rather slam my balls in a car door than raid lead anything.
[63:02.59]I would rather do that.
[63:03.45]I mean, I feel like you kind of, like, already did that the other day.
[63:09.53]No, Molten Core, Blackwing Lair, I, no.
[63:15.51]Even if I learned everything and knew everything, I don't think anyone, I would, I would kill everybody.
[63:22.41]It would be awful.
[63:24.81]What makes it hard is, like, you probably don't,
[63:28.60]remember all the mechanics even if you've like watched other people do it until you've played it at least once yourself and everybody else by the time you get to 60 will have done it like six to ten times so it would be them not allowed to speak or correct you while you like tell everybody what you think they should do everyone would just have to like hold their tongue
[63:54.46]Okay, maybe if eventually, let's just say in a hypothetical 2% scenario, if eventually everybody that was playing had three level 60s and it's been enough time, then maybe, okay, maybe, whatever, maybe that would be fun to do, but every single person is going to die in that raid.
[64:16.79]It would be a, hey, which character do you want to delete?
[64:19.08]Because pick that one, that's who you're going to bring to the raid.
[64:25.68]And if for some Christmas miracle we get out, then... I don't know if I'd want to do it again.
[64:42.95]You couldn't full wipe a raid if you tried.
[64:46.03]Don't give me a challenge that, for some stupid reason, would actually end up happening.
[64:53.55]You could be the first raid leader of BWL.
[64:57.50]First raid leader to wipe all 40 people.
[65:05.99]Do we want to try Qin's keg or just skip it?
[65:11.25]It spawns everywhere.
[65:12.11]There's three or four places you have to go across the Barrens.
[65:16.09]I don't think it's guaranteed to be anywhere.
[65:22.01]Like I said in the guild meeting, I would be really happy if I made it to level 40.
[65:26.23]Maraudon is my Molten Core.
[65:29.81]We've said that, I think, previously.
[65:30.97]Yeah, the prospect of raiding is a little less exciting once everybody has already done it a dozen times.
[65:49.28]I think this is fun too.
[65:50.50]This is the best part of the game for me.
[65:51.96]Yeah, I like the leveling, like the journey up to 60.
[65:55.32]Yeah, the getting new abilities, getting upgrades, getting new gear, doing the dungeons, having a bunch of close calls.
[66:03.99]That's where all the fun is.
[66:07.69]Like arguably the leveling is harder because typically the ball is in your court.
[66:13.29]Like if you screw something up,
[66:16.63]you're gonna die if you're soloing right or if you even if you're in like a party of two or a five man but if you're in if you're in a 40 man raid you're just rolling the dice that you're not like the one in 40 or the two in 40 casualty that accidentally gets killed yeah and that absolutely has happened people have died just by a random ability that just double taps you and kills you it's like what okay I'm done I'm dead I guess
[66:45.69]Putting those fucking bags on when I get back to the bank.
[66:47.63]So we're gonna kill lieutenants here.
[67:00.80]Lieutenant no.
[67:02.48]It's from which wing slayers?
[67:05.91]OK.
[67:11.69]This place is very scary though.
[67:12.87]Just be careful.
[67:22.61]Almost halfway to 18.
[67:23.71]We just started.
[67:24.33]Look at this.
[67:24.89]I'll be 19 in an hour.
[67:30.81]If you just play WoW while also being retired, you'll be able to come back with like two full levels of rest XP each time.
[67:36.96]It'll go faster.
[67:37.78]Damn.
[67:47.64]Your rested XP is going to end?
[67:53.31]feels good to have it right now though all right if you got to 60 and then died do you think you would level again or do you think you would like uh mob tag or do you think you would just go from scratch as a different class
[68:23.06]I think I would probably because I have a couple other characters that are in this range and this is like from a while ago this is before I decided like oh I'm gonna play I'm gonna do only fangs it's maybe like I'll join the guild or whatever right um I would see if soda would be okay with hey if I like delete this character and he's naked and uh I do whatever the guild wants me to do can I like play with this person
[68:58.65]And if the answer was no, then the answer is no.
[69:04.98]Or mob tagging.
[69:05.82]You know what?
[69:06.22]Mob tagging probably to... Mob tagging to like level 30, I think would make sense to me.
[69:13.52]We need to be a little careful back here.
[69:15.20]We have to be a lot careful.
[69:18.89]The whole fucking village is here.
[69:25.68]But I think mob tag to 30, and then the 30 to 40 is, or mob tag to wherever I died.
[69:30.33]I don't think that's necessarily that bad to do, maybe?
[69:37.07]Okay, question.
[69:38.14]If you mob tag back to where you died every time you die, are you just playing soft core with extra steps?
[69:46.12]I think you're playing... You're making a group of people do this for you.
[69:51.48]Wait, pull that back.
[69:52.30]Pull back.
[69:52.70]Pull back.
[69:53.16]Pull that back.
[69:53.90]What am I sending him in there for?
[69:55.18]Oh my god.
[69:58.16]It would be, hey, whoever's mob tagging me, I hope you're ready to do that again.
[70:01.44]I can't wait to waste like a day of your time again.
[70:06.40]It's me.
[70:06.82]We're gonna get to level 40 again.
[70:08.18]My ninth character.
[70:18.30]Oh, that's a different person.
[70:21.20]I thought you pulled that guy.
[70:27.95]Oh, good.
[70:37.55]I thought about playing Mage.
[70:38.45]Somebody said he should have played Mage.
[70:39.57]Mage is fun, but Mage has a lot of responsibilities that I don't want.
[70:49.50]Yes, what you're saying is there's the potential for you to be held in low esteem if specific circumstances play out unfavorably.
[71:01.83]I just don't want to, because that class is very much the, you can do this, you can stop that person, you can ice block, you can cross Nova, you can polymorph.
[71:13.15]Me not polymorphing something or me not, like, Frost Novaring something and three people die, I'd feel so terrible about it.
[71:22.91]Basically, we want to play hardcore, but we don't want responsibilities.
[71:26.24]I understand it.
[71:27.70]Yeah, I want the least amount of responsibility in hardcore.
[71:31.54]And that actually kind of is Warlock.
[71:32.98]I mean, you banish some stuff sometimes, but... Warlock has... Hunter is maybe in that category too.
[71:45.00]But Warlock is kind of... You kind of just need to just kill shit.
[71:49.82]It's like, um... You want to be able to work for the company, and you don't want it to look like you need to be given more work from the boss.
[72:02.05]Like, you want to look just busy enough.
[72:06.47]Yeah, but banishes are fine, though.
[72:08.81]Banishing half of the mobs at the end of Molten Core, I can do that.
[72:11.75]That's easy.
[72:12.09]But...
[72:15.74]If I have to worry about... Oh, hey, we're all being chased.
[72:20.28]Jerma, you're the mage.
[72:22.65]Oh, don't worry.
[72:23.41]He's gonna save us.
[72:24.89]And I'm like, wait, what button?
[72:27.69]Oh, wait, Frost Nova.
[72:29.91]Oops.
[72:30.67]And everyone's running this way and I do Frost Nova here.
[72:38.36]Basically, you don't want like two dozen people to analyze the inevitable clip.
[72:44.06]Oh, I think that's funny for sure.
[72:45.96]But if the inevitable clip is... I don't know.
[72:48.92]I just don't want to kill anybody.
[72:49.94]Well, yeah.
[72:50.82]I'm saying in this case, it's a clip that's not good.
[72:58.90]I mean, it's inevitable.
[72:59.79]Shit's going to hit the fan at some point.
[73:01.65]It always does.
[73:02.39]I roached today.
[73:05.23]Oh, no.
[73:06.95]But I had to.
[73:08.11]I was in Ashenvale on my 29 Shaman.
[73:13.22]And we were doing a quest where you have to go up on a hill, and you plant a flag, and a bunch of pigmen attack the hill.
[73:22.69]And so I typed in Ginchat, I was like, anybody doing this quest?
[73:25.55]Because you can't solo it.
[73:27.19]And then I got invited to a party of three, so I was the fourth man.
[73:31.71]So they were, like, right there.
[73:33.01]They show up, but then I get the alert that there is, like, an elite close by.
[73:39.40]So I say, careful, elite!
[73:43.02]And it's the giant tree protector that patrols the area.
[73:47.56]And he's a level 35 elite.
[73:48.64]Yeah, that's terrible.
[73:50.30]And I'm level 29, and they're all level 25s and 26s.
[73:53.72]And the dude, his... the last thing he ever says is, that elite won't aggro.
[73:59.55]Oh god.
[74:01.85]Less than three seconds later, he's getting entangling roots by the tree.
[74:06.88]oh my god that's awful and he's level like 26 and he pvp flags you what so I turned into ghost wolf as fast as I could and started running and his uh his mage friend stuck around to try and slow and got down to like 60 hp and I I did not even get close to pushing a button to help what about like a level 35 elite versus a 29 shaman
[74:35.82]yeah that's not gonna uh and I did I didn't know any of these guys and I was like are these your boys afterward and they were all like yeah we're laughing about it in the discord right now they're like do you have a clip so I can show the rest of the guild of our friend getting his ass kicked there's some really scary scary shit in this game
[75:05.47]Even in Desolace, walking around Desolace, Desolace is one of the weirdest zones ever.
[75:12.87]That zone, there's, it's a level 34, like 32 to 35, but there are just random level 25, 35.
[75:21.55]Hold on.
[75:23.10]This guy's in trouble.
[75:25.52]Oh no, maybe not.
[75:26.76]I think this guy's pulling stuff on purpose.
[75:28.88]Oh, okay.
[75:30.04]There's, uh... There's random, like, 38s that walk around.
[75:34.37]So it's 31 to, like, 39.
[75:37.33]And it happens randomly.
[75:39.33]There'll just be a random bird that's level 40.
[75:41.89]And then right next to the bird is, like, a level 30 scorpion.
[75:47.00]It's just... The level is all over the place for so much of the stuff in that zone.
[76:01.09]I don't even remember what Desolace is like other than like it's namesake.
[76:07.54]I haven't seen it since like 06.
[76:08.68]Uh, it's gray.
[76:11.76]Yeah, I just remember it's just gray and empty and that's it.
[76:16.85]It is the gray zone in World of Warcraft.
[76:47.96]drop rate isn't great it's true but um it's good xp though it is yeah because I am already almost to 18. you fold your pizza are you planning oh my goodness all right never mind time that person out
[77:17.25]With no context, I have no idea where that was going, but time that person out.
[77:29.66]You open up with a fucking pizza question.
[77:36.86]Can't believe this guy hates pizza.
[77:47.56]Are you fighting this dude?
[77:50.45]I was fighting.
[77:51.77]Yeah, I'm already 50%.
[77:53.21]Damn.
[77:54.55]This is good experience.
[78:04.54]There's like four, five, six, five slayers back here.
[78:09.22]Let's get them.
[78:32.78]Maybe I do want Affliction.
[78:37.71]Affliction's so fun.
[78:40.21]You have to keep the dots up, but it is fun.
[78:41.69]Are you still deciding between like being a Hellfire spammer or more dots or a demon guy?
[78:49.70]I have to get the moves first because once I get Soulfire, I might never want to go back, but you get that late.
[78:55.54]You don't get that for a while, I don't think.
[79:02.64]Yeah, I'm playing the rip aggro and die spec.
[79:05.34]Because you do a soul fire and crit for 10,000, Ragnaros is going to kill you.
[79:17.95]I think if I had a warlock, I would go dots.
[79:21.23]Dots are so fun, especially the couple of expansions.
[79:24.69]Affliction is so fun.
[79:26.65]Unstable affliction is such a fun move.
[79:36.08]Turn on enemy NPC names.
[79:37.52]You're making me nervous.
[79:38.90]They're not on?
[79:39.38]Oh, like nameplates?
[79:43.72]Oh, they're not on.
[79:44.56]Oh, shit.
[79:47.67]Hey, some of us just use the target card.
[79:50.67]I think I like classes that have engines that you build.
[80:08.32]I think it's what I like about Shaman.
[80:11.06]Like every fight, you have to like, okay, totem, totem, totem, totem, buff.
[80:15.90]Now I'm doing max damage.
[80:19.26]Shaman seems fun.
[80:20.32]I like ramping up.
[80:21.96]Enhancement seems fun.
[80:23.08]I don't know how good it is in classic.
[80:24.48]I don't remember.
[80:24.92]I think we may have had the conversation already, but I just forget.
[80:30.44]I think...
[80:35.19]enhance is the it's great for leveling and then you respect but I'm not gonna respect what's the worst class in the game though worst class in the game is probably red paladin I don't think that red paladin has any use at all uh arcane mage trash too yeah arcane mage red paladin and going all the way down discipline for priest doesn't really do very much for you
[81:08.46]Has it already been an hour?
[81:10.74]Oh my God.
[81:12.85]Just chilling.
[81:14.07]Well, I was eating too.
[81:15.23]I was going to say, I don't think we've been here killing these things for an hour.
[81:20.93]Doing this thing.
[81:21.91]Though we may be by the end of it, because I've got two rings so far.
[81:27.12]I mean, if it's experience, it's experience.
[81:28.60]Whatever.
[81:31.50]been doing this thing where I've been getting up every hour and doing the three minutes of ads to kill the pre-rolls and make some money do you do you run any ads on your stream at all no uh just the pre-rolls like the old school but I you know I might swap it up
[81:51.50]Honestly, it seems like... I don't think everyone's blowing smoke up my ass.
[81:57.13]Maybe they are.
[81:58.35]But having the planned breaks rather than just get your face blown off by a pre-roll.
[82:06.36]Joining a stream, it feels like a lot of people prefer to just know when they're going to happen.
[82:11.56]That's what I prefer them to.
[82:14.94]And it gets rid of the pre-rolls for an hour and trying to get rid of them permanently.
[82:21.26]Listen, I'm an enlightened Twitch Turbo user, so... Right, yeah.
[82:28.54]So I don't know anything about that from a viewer experience.
[82:34.76]I got one.
[82:38.28]I got my three.
[82:46.65]But you were back in the... I mean, not even back in the day, just in general.
[82:52.50]Do you remember, like, sitting there for five straight hours and you just go, oh my god, I haven't moved?
[82:59.02]Sometimes I still do.
[83:00.55]Yeah.
[83:01.83]It's actually a good way just to force yourself to get up and just even move around for two or three minutes.
[83:07.21]Yeah, I think the thing that stopped me was... I don't... I was afraid I don't have the attention span to, like, keep track.
[83:16.50]And I would not even notice that the ads were playing.
[83:20.01]Because that's what I don't like.
[83:22.85]From a theoretical perspective.
[83:24.53]If you're watching somebody stream and they don't even give a shit when the ads are running.
[83:30.20]So I don't want to accidentally... I feel like that's what I would end up doing.
[83:35.07]It's just like forgetting.
[83:37.19]they actually the the feature that's in here now it kind of tells you like oh hey like it's been an hour here here comes ads if you want to you're doing the hour thing right um it actually pops up very very brightly you can see it it gives you like a bunch of time to plan it
[84:04.05]I've actually shut them down twice in a row now.
[84:07.93]Oh yeah, you can kick them for a length of time or something.
[84:13.55]I think you're allowed to boot them a few times if you haven't run them.
[84:17.59]I don't know.
[84:18.67]I have no idea how it works.
[84:22.21]I still have no idea how the ad system works.
[84:24.15]I've asked so many questions and it's still kind of like, how the fuck do these even work?
[84:37.63]get some music going you know what that would actually be kind of a good idea get like a good playlist and pump it through that vod thing but what I was saying is that one of the reasons why it like people have seen I've been streaming a lot the last like week or two right that streaming you I don't know you still like me up
[85:03.24]I was just sitting there for so long, it would just... I would feel so awful afterwards.
[85:07.34]I don't know why.
[85:07.84]It just was... My body just felt like it was fucking tearing apart.
[85:10.68]I'm going to be honest with you.
[85:15.00]Mine still does that.
[85:17.42]But it'll do that regardless sometimes, right?
[85:21.01]Sometimes it doesn't matter.
[85:21.85]But I noticed it was happening more often streaming something that I wasn't really enjoying.
[85:30.28]So when there's things that you're very passionate about, I feel like it's a little easier.
[85:35.38]Yeah, that's true.
[85:36.38]Just grinding and having fun, doing whatever.
[85:43.16]I feel like it kind of forces everybody to get up.
[85:45.35]It forces you to go or even just hop to another stream or something.
[86:04.59]But yeah, it's pretty common for me too to finish.
[86:07.47]Another thing is for me, I think talking for hours rattles your brain.
[86:13.81]like the like it just vibrates your skull also these are not the guys that drop our shit oh these are not I'm just like just like shadow holding dude Nancy Drew it was a rough day Nancy Drew uh was it was bad the game was wonderful but by brain uh that clock puzzle took I think like a few months off my life
[86:52.25]Nancy Drew in the case of the missing brain.
[86:56.29]That probably is a title that is one of these games.
[87:01.17]We got four.
[87:03.07]Almost there.
[87:03.47]Okay, remove the swear filter.
[87:13.73]You guys want to hear a bunch of swears?
[87:21.48]Is that what it is?
[87:37.83]Oh, you need one more!
[87:39.99]Getting close!
[87:40.77]We're almost there.
[87:47.58]We didn't get that?
[87:48.20]What?
[87:48.52]I thought I tagged it.
[87:54.22]We've murked the entire harpy population out here.
[87:56.56]Like, there's just corpses.
[87:59.66]I mean, do we consider layering?
[88:02.44]I mean, you only need one.
[88:11.78]Man, everyone around is just tagging only the Slayers.
[88:14.52]Put them back here.
[88:17.91]Be careful of the ones on the left here.
[88:20.75]You mean like that one?
[88:21.99]Yep.
[88:23.81]Where's my Voidwalker?
[88:24.81]My Voidwalker's in a different party.
[88:26.09]He's like hanging out with other people.
[88:41.21]vibes are off this place is a death trap oh yeah I know the actual death trap is rend disappears in three minutes so oh yeah let's get this done and get at her pulling four or five of these with rend is fine without it no all right I need one more come on one more of these and rings
[89:23.15]Shit.
[89:39.83]Oh, we can take two of these.
[89:41.15]We got it.
[89:43.75]How many times are you going to resist?
[89:50.44]Ten times?
[89:51.35]There we go.
[89:52.09]Are we done?
[89:54.05]Yep.
[89:55.43]The streaming hurts body thing is exacerbated, I think, a lot as well.
[89:59.99]Anybody who has a job like this probably understands where if you eat a meal, like let's say at noon, and then you stream for 10 hours and you don't eat, like people who have jobs where you don't eat for like 10 to 12 hours.
[90:13.04]Yeah.
[90:14.24]In between.
[90:15.34]Sucks.
[90:16.86]Unless you just, like, eat while you're streaming or something.
[90:20.18]I was saying this before, too.
[90:21.49]I asked everybody, how long is your lunch break?
[90:25.59]I asked a lot of people saying, oh, 30 minutes, 30 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes.
[90:29.65]I'm like, what?
[90:33.73]You need an hour for lunch.
[90:36.62]30 minutes?
[90:38.14]If you have 30 minutes, you can't even leave.
[90:41.28]You just have to bring your lunch every day.
[90:49.16]And you've got to fight over the break room microwave.
[90:53.32]I feel like by the time you are done... Okay, I'm going to take my break.
[90:57.04]Start the clock.
[90:59.65]Count down about five to ten minutes just to get your shit together to sit down to even eat anything in the first place.
[91:11.08]Okay, chat, if you could...
[91:13.80]make your lunch break 30 minutes longer but you have to stay at work 30 minutes longer to compensate would you do it I wouldn't and you get you get paid for the time like you get you get like a like a small 30 minute bump in pay
[91:43.15]Once we get out of here, I'm going to get up and move around.
[91:52.68]And also, getting up every hour almost just... The streams, they're little hourly milestones for my brain.
[91:59.62]Okay, it's been this long.
[92:08.25]I can't carry anymore.
[92:16.27]I think this should be... This should be like 20 minutes where you just like drink tea and then a 40 minute lunch break.
[92:31.16]Each office should have a tea zone.
[92:38.58]OK, but like for me, is it weird that if they offered me like a one hour siesta in the middle of the workday, I would take it even for no extra pay?
[92:48.01]I'm heading back to the crossroads for the turn in and I'm going to take a break.
[92:53.23]What did you say?
[92:53.71]Say that one more time.
[92:55.27]I said if like I would if they gave me a one hour siesta.
[92:59.19]Yes.
[92:59.65]With no extra pay, I would still take it.
[93:02.43]Like in the middle of the day.
[93:04.75]I see.
[93:05.17]I think siesta is.
[93:06.73]In addition to the 30 minute lunch break.
[93:12.36]I'm going to get up for a minute.
[93:17.52]I'll be back in a few minutes.
[93:21.14]Be good.
[93:22.22]Get up.
[93:22.90]Go grab a tea, maybe.
[93:24.12]What time is it?
[93:25.88]7.30?
[93:26.30]Perfect tea time.
[93:29.94]See you guys in a few minutes.
[93:34.15]Here come ads.
[93:35.85]Oh, no, that's not accurate, but the ads is.
[93:40.29]We're back.
[93:49.21]Am I alive?
[93:51.87]Yes, I am live.
[93:57.57]Yeah, I was doing some shaman earlier.
[93:59.67]Oh, ding.
[94:10.70]Sounds good.
[94:32.21]Amen.
[96:59.85]Thank you.
[98:41.25]Oh, this is sad.
[98:44.57]I only have one bag of peppermint tea left.
[98:48.25]What a disaster.
[98:59.76]Welcome back.
[99:14.86]Drinking too much tea, you're going to get kidney stones?
[99:20.38]Okay.
[99:21.32]Well, I will say when I go BRB, it says I'm getting tea.
[99:31.00]That's not always the case.
[99:35.14]No way.
[99:37.24]Sometimes it's water.
[99:38.30]Sometimes it is to go pee.
[99:41.32]Sometimes it's to, you know, do whatever.
[99:46.59]I squat up and down too.
[99:48.47]I thought the whole time you were just pouring tea into your toilet.
[99:54.47]Yeah, sometimes it's a bush light.
[99:55.87]You know, you never know.
[99:57.69]Add a bush light today.
[99:58.61]Alright, where's this turn in?
[100:09.80]It's up the watchtower.
[100:18.44]I'm going to say people who like tea, like you drink, hate sweet tea.
[100:25.00]Is that true?
[100:25.44]And people that like sweet tea hate regular hot tea.
[100:32.32]Like they're on the opposite ends of the spectrum.
[100:34.82]We're going to go back up there and kill that named person now.
[100:38.51]Well, let's just go do it.
[100:40.73]I think that there is a maybe...
[100:45.14]I don't like the, like, southern sweet tea.
[100:49.66]The way that it's made in the south.
[100:51.36]We're talking about, yeah, for people in chat, we're talking about southern sweet tea, not, not like, like a tea and sugar.
[100:56.41]Yeah, I love brisk iced tea is one of my, I love that shit.
[101:00.53]I would drink that every day if I could.
[101:02.61]And that's a sweet tea, right?
[101:04.99]It's sweet black tea.
[101:09.68]But I don't like the sweet tea, the in quotes, sweet tea from the south.
[101:15.58]I think it tastes like battery acid.
[101:21.96]I mean, it's like it gets injected.
[101:23.66]It's just sugar water.
[101:26.41]Directly into your veins.
[101:29.29]Wait, did you already turn in?
[101:31.33]Yep.
[101:31.51]Oh, we gotta go to Ratchet and turn this other one in.
[101:33.07]We could do that after though.
[101:34.19]Let's just go kill this named Harpy and then be done with it.
[101:38.63]I am very shaman brained.
[101:39.93]I keep trying to transform into Ghost Wolf.
[101:43.55]Which is one of the best moves.
[101:55.52]I'm going to say L take.
[101:58.78]Uh oh.
[102:00.56]What, the battery acid take?
[102:02.22]I don't know.
[102:02.72]I think I just made that person very angry.
[102:10.62]I like black tea.
[102:11.28]I like brisk iced tea.
[102:12.50]Brisk iced tea, Lipton iced tea.
[102:14.22]I'm talking about the one that you get at the gas station.
[102:16.59]The one like the Lipton iced tea in the gas station.
[102:19.83]That one's good.
[102:20.27]I like that.
[102:29.15]I actually don't really like hot black tea.
[102:35.21]But it's funny because hot green tea, I love.
[102:38.92]But cold green tea, I think is kind of bleh.
[102:42.16]I'm not a big fan.
[102:42.84]We're gonna need a spreadsheet for this.
[102:49.33]The hot versus cold spectrum of each tea.
[102:54.95]Hot or cold sake?
[103:02.33]uh that's a good depends both uh I don't know why I'm running in a straight line through the barons that's uh what that's not what I should be doing and in fact I'm gonna get us killed let's get on the road yeah we we're in like the coal car boss area yeah that's uh that could have just been a really bad moment arizona ice tea is really good I like arizona I like pretty much all the arizona flavors
[103:34.73]What about a hot or cold bush light?
[103:36.69]Are you going to Echiaki?
[103:40.23]Um... Who are you going to?
[103:43.19]What am I doing?
[103:46.54]Because the name dude is northeast of the crossroads.
[103:49.88]Yeah, it's where we just were.
[103:51.54]I just want to avoid that nonsense here.
[103:53.98]No, we're northwest.
[103:56.86]That Serena Bloodfeather is up in the harpy place where we just were.
[104:02.37]I just didn't want to one-sweat through.
[104:04.57]The level 21?
[104:05.27]Yeah, we could do that, probably.
[104:07.59]Yeah, we got it.
[104:08.13]I think we had killed it already.
[104:10.62]I have one durability on my chest piece, I just realized.
[104:13.44]Uh-oh.
[104:20.78]I'm going to have to fight her naked.
[104:25.93]Oh, should I turn off the glow?
[104:28.13]That was actually part of the recommended things in the Only Fangs welcome message.
[104:31.51]I left it on.
[104:33.43]Because that's the way I originally experienced it back in 2004.
[104:36.88]But yeah, the only way you drink an ice- only ice-cold bush light.
[104:48.42]It's the only way I want it.
[104:49.26]Let's be careful, Luz.
[104:59.92]freezing cold I'm talking you grab the can and it's oh ow it's cold
[105:26.14]Ooh, ow, that's cold is what I say whenever I'm like, just washed my hands and I'm trying to get ice out of the ice tray.
[105:32.06]And it sticks to my fingers.
[105:33.60]Oof, that's, yeah, that sucks.
[105:37.68]And you kind of have that freak out moment where you say, okay, don't, I got to not freak out.
[105:41.25]Don't rip it off.
[105:41.79]Just go and put water on it.
[105:57.71]movie where the kid puts his tongue on the pole christmas story that's so stupid an american classic what a stupid kid
[106:25.55]That movie, like, scarred me when I was a kid.
[106:29.13]I became terrified of doing exactly that, even though I would never ever stick my tongue out and, like, lick an ice pole.
[106:38.31]But I became traumatized by it.
[106:42.56]Yeah, it's real.
[106:43.96]That really can happen.
[106:50.06]You've got to be very careful.
[106:52.24]How many times have you drank a cold drink with a piece of ice in it?
[106:55.64]That... Or just even put an ice cube in your mouth.
[106:58.54]And you realize, wait a minute, this is stuck to my tongue and the roof of my mouth and shit.
[107:02.43]I don't think I've ever stuck a whole cube in my mouth.
[107:05.99]You've never even put a whole cube of ice in your mouth?
[107:08.13]Not a whole cube.
[107:09.07]Like, if I'm drinking a drink in some ice, you know...
[107:14.65]goes with the drink then yeah I'll crunch some ice but I I don't think I've ever just like gotten an ice cube like yep I'm eating that you've never done it just put an ice cube in your mouth just for the thrill how big of an ice cube are we talking not huge just like a like like the square ones or like the yeah like a cube like an ice cube like the little half moon shaped ones like a fridge cube
[107:45.25]I don't know, I live a pretty boring life.
[107:47.25]I don't really like eat.
[107:49.51]I'm not really a thrill seeker.
[107:50.82]I don't know, sometimes you just... Oh yeah, that's ice and I just want to do it.
[108:03.56]My brain is too susceptible to brain freeze.
[108:07.99]It's like a permanent debuff.
[108:13.25]Just an ice cream cone, I'm in danger.
[108:18.05]Yeah, that's rough.
[108:18.91]I've only had brain freeze for real only a few times.
[108:22.90]And it was as bad as some of my worst migraine headaches that I sometimes get.
[108:28.12]So I get it.
[108:29.52]I understand why people are so avoidant of a lot of that shit.
[108:37.10]Now, if we're talking like the small ice, like Sonic ice or like Kane's ice or something, then yeah.
[108:45.13]The pellet ice that they have at Sonic is amazing.
[108:50.00]Every other disgusting item on that menu is not even worth it.
[108:57.34]Welcome back everyone for day three of our Food Network Chats.
[109:01.35]Today we are talking about fast food ice and the many shapes that they take.
[109:06.99]Here with me right now is Jerma985 who reportedly eats ice cubes for the thrill.
[109:13.16]you know you know what that is we're just chilling out we start talking about shapes of ice that's right you you got a point all right be careful this is where it spawns and yeah we might should we I would say let's layer but no let's not do that just make one group I think there's just enough people for a full party
[109:44.20]I think that's correct.
[109:54.65]They can't join our group.
[109:57.07]Yeah, we got five here.
[110:01.39]Wait.
[110:02.81]Am I not in the party?
[110:05.29]No, I'm asking.
[110:06.57]Oh, don't.
[110:07.00]This is my keyboard.
[110:08.18]I'm going to look like I'm screaming.
[110:09.06]There's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven people here.
[110:12.47]The seven people?
[110:14.29]Yeah, seven.
[110:18.99]One, two, three.
[110:22.26]Who else wanted to join?
[110:24.60]Who else?
[110:40.84]Oh, what the heck?
[110:44.60]Where is this person?
[110:47.02]Invite me back.
[110:48.26]I don't need it.
[110:49.12]Okay.
[110:50.64]Invite.
[110:51.20]Invite.
[110:57.10]Yeah, there's a weirdly odd number of people here.
[111:00.83]Who else?
[111:01.13]Who am I missing here?
[111:05.41]Their names are darker blue if they're not in the party.
[111:09.91]This person doesn't need it.
[111:11.79]Is there anybody else here?
[111:24.64]Oh my god, I'm like writing like an idiot.
[111:36.45]Okay.
[111:37.41]I can't even write.
[111:41.69]Did you know if you don't want your ice to crack when you put it in the drink, if you just leave it out for a couple minutes, it'll equalize more to the room temperature and then it won't crack?
[111:51.22]You ever make clear ice before?
[111:54.09]Uh, I have.
[111:54.93]I have one of those, um, fancy pants, big cube, clear ice, like, cocktail things.
[112:03.69]Ooh.
[112:06.67]Are you still a whiskey guy?
[112:07.91]Are you still drinking whiskey?
[112:09.11]Yeah, I am.
[112:10.51]Ooh.
[112:12.05]What are you on now?
[112:13.00]Anything?
[112:13.26]Uh, I just finished the bottle of, um, the Suntory Hibiki.
[112:22.94]Mmm, damn.
[112:28.22]I like this chat message.
[112:29.96]I'm a Pepsi guy.
[112:37.44]Pepsi's good.
[112:38.94]The whole Pepsi versus Coke is way overblown.
[112:41.06]They're both good.
[112:43.12]I'll be a fence sitter on that one until the day I die.
[112:45.76]See, I'm not.
[112:46.45]I am a Coke.
[112:48.61]Give me that Coke can.
[112:50.31]I want Coca-Cola.
[112:53.71]We are not friends.
[113:04.04]Although the, I will say the, what's the, the, the, the Pepsi with the, what is it?
[113:10.90]The it's like nitrous Pepsi or something like nitrous oxide.
[113:17.07]What, what's, what's the, what's nitrous oxide?
[113:20.11]What is it?
[113:20.59]What's in the Pepsi?
[113:21.37]The new one, the nitrous, the extra bubbly one.
[113:32.87]Isn't it just Nitro?
[113:38.09]Yes, Nitro Pepsi.
[113:39.77]They put the... They put nitrogen in it.
[113:43.74]Nitrous.
[113:46.66]Nitrous?
[113:48.34]So it's a nitrogen Pepsi.
[113:51.00]Wait, wait, wait.
[113:52.87]Is this like a Fast and the Furious ad spot?
[113:55.89]No, no, no, this is real, and it's actually very good.
[113:59.37]It's called Nitro Pepsi, and it's a nitrogen-infused Pepsi.
[114:04.96]It's actually very, very good.
[114:06.06]I feel like we're on one of those, like... Oh, there we go.
[114:24.79]It's like we're two hosts on the TV late night, like phone number on the screen, trying to get people to call in to buy like the product that we were not prepped to present.
[114:42.87]Yeah, I did not present that correctly.
[114:47.58]I added an extra two letters at the end and whatever.
[114:54.98]It got discontinued last month.
[114:57.76]Well, it was very good.
[115:04.30]I also love nitrogen cold brew.
[115:09.01]You can tell when something has nitrogen when it's the tiny little bubbles.
[115:11.95]The carbonation in soda, the bubbles are huge.
[115:15.65]But nitrogen, it's, they're so small and they kind of just down your throat.
[115:23.84]They just kind of
[115:26.64]So you just want every drink to be infused with like pop rocks.
[115:31.82]Nitro cold brew is amazing.
[115:33.00]It has an absolute shitload of caffeine in it, though.
[115:36.27]So don't drink four of them.
[115:41.51]Did you say don't drink four of them?
[115:44.07]Yeah, I mean, some people drink coffee all day.
[115:45.87]I mean, I drink some kind of I drink maybe two or three coffees at most, maybe a day to one to two.
[115:52.80]Some people just smash coffee.
[115:54.62]If you drink a nitrogen coffee all day, you're gonna... You're gonna go through your roof of your house like a fucking rocket.
[116:06.51]I don't know what... Caffeine is supposed to do.
[116:10.87]You know?
[116:11.25]Because like... ADHD... Means... It does not... I could drink a coffee at... An hour before bed, no problem.
[116:22.73]My mother does that too.
[116:23.67]Holly does that too.
[116:25.19]Everybody I know does that, but I don't do that.
[116:27.60]I can't do that.
[116:28.12]I think we're good.
[116:34.80]We could kill some raptors here and try to get the horns.
[116:38.13]Do we have a... We have a new party member.
[116:41.01]Oh, we do.
[116:41.51]Well, whatever.
[116:41.99]We're just leaving anyways.
[116:44.93]Oh, I didn't even say thank you.
[116:51.48]Too busy talking about nitrogen.
[116:57.88]Grab this other raptor.
[117:19.63]There's definitely going to be a raptor horn on this one for you.
[117:23.48]Guaranteed.
[117:26.28]There is.
[117:28.20]Oh.
[117:29.24]And this one too.
[117:29.86]This person's over here pulling raptors.
[117:46.18]This one might have one for me.
[117:50.22]No.
[117:52.10]Hey, does anyone else have ADHD?
[117:55.59]Apparently somebody said one in nine people have it now.
[117:59.41]Oh, how do you know when someone has ADHD?
[118:00.71]What were we talking about?
[118:12.99]I was just, I guess, completely unaware of how many other people ate Captain Crunch for fucking dinner all the way through when they were 18.
[118:26.59]I have three boxes of Captain Crunch.
[118:30.08]One regular, one peanut butter, and one with the berries.
[118:34.04]Just because I don't know which one I'm going to want at any given time.
[118:48.37]Oh, that's a symptom of ADHD.
[118:56.70]Oh yeah, the known symptoms of ADHD.
[119:00.00]Attention problems, hyperactivity, spouts of high energy and very low energy.
[119:07.11]Oh, and wanting to eat Captain Crunch for dinner every day.
[119:10.53]Of course.
[119:12.09]It's in the book.
[119:13.15]It's in the science.
[119:13.79]It's in the documentation.
[119:14.45]I read that on WebMD, yeah.
[119:20.87]I still need a couple of these.
[119:22.69]But we might not see any more raptors.
[119:25.21]So I'm cool with just leaving.
[119:29.01]Although they do spawn.
[119:29.95]Let's just get it.
[119:31.21]I don't want to have to worry about it.
[119:32.37]Let's just kill it.
[119:33.15]Just kill stuff here.
[119:35.19]I've got all five, so you should be getting whatever drops come from them.
[119:45.17]And my bags are full because they're small.
[119:50.67]I got a full inventory too.
[119:55.98]Raptors on the way to report to cadre.
[119:57.86]Oh, is that what we have to do?
[119:59.60]Oh, okay.
[120:09.03]Yeah, we do it.
[120:09.71]There are some that way.
[120:10.73]We have to turn this in.
[120:15.94]Big sneeze.
[120:27.36]what's the fastest roller coaster you've ever been on me or you you um well I don't ride roller coasters because I am a whiny baby who is afraid of them
[120:59.78]That's fair.
[121:04.96]And I also have crippling anxiety.
[121:09.02]That's fair.
[121:09.40]You're not going to ride crazy, fast, scary roller coasters.
[121:14.66]I haven't rode one in a long time, but Superman Ride of Steel from Six Flags New England is probably the fastest roller coaster I've ever been on.
[121:22.20]That first drop in Superman Ride of Steel, I think it was, it's called like Bizarro Superman now.
[121:26.20]Does it even still exist?
[121:27.02]Is it still in Six Flags New England?
[121:31.61]I have not been to Six Flags New England in a lot... at least probably 15 years.
[121:39.62]I think that there's two types of people.
[121:41.82]There's the person that has the like... spicy taste bud.
[121:47.31]And there's like the, you know, like there's people who have the spicy makes their brain happy and the spicy does not make their brain happy.
[121:54.89]And then there's the thrill rides make their brain happy and the thrill rides make their brain very unhappy.
[122:00.96]I don't know if the Venn diagram there overlaps, but it's similar.
[122:05.92]Like you either have that portion of your brain or you don't.
[122:18.50]Yeah, it's... It's funny because I love... I actually don't... I actually like roller coasters a lot.
[122:30.70]But there's other things that I just won't do.
[122:34.31]Like, for instance, that ride that... Nobody wants to ride this ride, though.
[122:39.51]Oh, the Strat?
[122:41.21]No, any ride.
[122:42.97]Oh, you mean the one that just pretends to kill you?
[122:46.76]yeah like the one that you can throw yourself off of the top of the stratosphere yeah the stratosphere in las vegas guys has a ride that pretends to kill you it literally it's a it's a roller coaster seat that just has a track that's maybe 10 feet long and it it's on top of the stratosphere and it just puts you here we go we're going down as if it's going to drop you and it's just 10 feet it just it's like you're going to fall off
[123:18.38]Yeah, I would not ride that.
[123:25.18]Did you mention it's on top of a building that stretches to like one of the tallest buildings in Las Vegas?
[123:32.38]Yeah, the stratosphere is, the strat is like, I don't know, how tall is the strat?
[123:38.21]Let's find out.
[123:38.71]I can't even get this quest.
[123:45.27]So, so.
[123:46.46]It is 1,149 feet.
[123:48.78]That's huge.
[123:50.28]Or 350 meters in non-freedom units.
[123:57.31]I'm not going to Ashenvale right now.
[124:02.29]That's probably like the top of the needle.
[124:04.63]So I don't think you actually go to the top of that.
[124:06.27]But it's, you know, it's up there.
[124:13.81]Yeah, I will ride a fast roller coaster.
[124:16.72]It could go a thousand miles per hour.
[124:22.06]But if I go to a county fair, I'm not getting on any of those rides.
[124:29.77]Any of them.
[124:32.01]Not the one that flips you around, not the big bungee jump one, the cord, not the one that's the pirate ship.
[124:38.21]No, all rides at the county fair are puke rides.
[124:42.19]They're rides that are designed to make you feel awful.
[124:45.66]They're not fun.
[124:47.24]It's just, hey, after you get off of this two to three minute encounter, you're going to feel worse.
[124:52.60]A roller coaster, even if it spins... Like the spinning colander?
[124:59.28]Yeah, that thing's awful.
[125:00.06]A roller coaster is forward motion.
[125:06.45]It can go 100 miles per hour, 200 miles per hour.
[125:08.75]It's forward motion.
[125:10.13]Even a loop-de-loop, that's fine.
[125:11.23]It's forward motion.
[125:17.72]it's that okay but let's be real it's that one video we've all seen of the like crowd the throng of people going to keep that one pirate ship ride upright when it's like rocking back and forth that ruined all of us oh dude we got points the undead just got two points
[125:47.23]Oh, no, you just reminded me.
[125:48.49]I didn't spend my talent.
[125:58.32]Don't tell Soda, but I'm still on Team Orc, even though I'm a Tauren right now.
[126:04.32]You're going to fucking jail.
[126:11.21]They're gonna make me go to Guru Bashi.
[126:16.77]There's some pretty good riveting walking gameplay.
[126:20.09]That's probably a third of the entire game of World of Warcraft, I think.
[126:24.53]At least classic.
[126:25.93]Whatever.
[126:26.35]This stream is on like your third monitor anyway.
[126:30.54]The zipper ride almost killed me, I swear.
[126:34.68]Yeah, they're not even rides.
[126:35.82]They're just... They are the current version of medieval torture devices.
[126:41.11]If the zipper was back in the 1400s, kings would be using it to torment people.
[126:49.35]You'd see people up there going, oh, please, no, I didn't mean to steal those coins from the father, please, your majesty.
[126:59.78]We just took these things and made them fun, apparently.
[127:07.62]The majority of things people would do as quote-unquote thrill-seekers are things that killed people previously.
[127:13.79]That's the allure.
[127:14.77]It's like, hey, look, we have evolved as humans to be able to do the thing that killed my great-great-great-grandfathers, but na-na-na-na-na-na, I'm not dead, and you are.
[127:28.44]I can jump out of planes.
[127:29.64]Who cares?
[127:30.96]It is weird.
[127:32.40]It's so bizarre that a lot of these amusement park rides are, like you said, ha ha ha, look, we're about to die.
[127:41.95]It's like, what?
[127:44.03]No, get out of there.
[127:45.11]What are you talking about?
[127:48.29]It's just like tricking our subconscious into thinking that for just like a few seconds.
[127:59.95]You should do an amusement park stream where I just cry on every ride and I would go full method acting and then real tears would come out.
[128:09.83]Even on like the teacups, I would just start crying.
[128:11.91]Tears would be actually coming down my eyes.
[128:14.09]I could do that, but I wouldn't have to pretend.
[128:23.50]Even on the teacups?
[128:26.85]the teacups but like I would probably be crying because um like do I need a reason true hey do you did you ride the strawberry ride where you have the the wheel in the middle that you spin and the more you spin it it's kind of like um driving a car with no power steering and you have to really wrench it you spin it's a circle disc in the middle there's like a yeah like a metal circle in the middle that you have to like rotate yourself
[128:53.26]Yeah, and everybody is going kind of slow, but there's one dad and, uh, usually a son, and the dad is ripping this thing while the son cries.
[129:02.38]I feel like I- we used to spin that as fast as it could go too, yeah.
[129:13.38]There's a group of teenagers that are trying to go as hard as possible and there's like three or four people in one booth.
[129:21.83]And then there's the one dad and the son and the dad's just having a grand old time.
[129:38.30]And there's always that one guy that walks up to the attendant.
[129:40.68]Hey, can you smoke on this ride?
[129:43.75]Oh, no, sorry.
[129:44.27]There's no smoking in the whole park.
[129:46.03]Oh.
[129:47.39]You sure?
[129:49.03]Thought I read something.
[129:50.67]I thought I read something.
[129:54.41]Speaking of axes, that's a pretty good one.
[130:04.37]Yeah, I just took that little upgrade.
[130:06.45]I'm going to sell it.
[130:13.85]I got a full inventory.
[130:17.09]Yep, it is time to sell.
[130:20.45]And also get some new abilities, yes?
[130:25.68]Oh, you do have your... Yeah, you got to 18.
[130:27.62]Wait, are you... Wait, what are you?
[130:30.08]I'm literally three bars away.
[130:34.78]Yeah, I can wait to go back to Org.
[130:37.64]It's not going to kill me if I fall from here, right?
[130:51.60]All right, for all you WoW, uh, WoW experts, especially you WoW classic experts, is Curse of Agony better than Curse of Doom?
[131:07.21]Eventually.
[131:08.93]Curse of Doom is, it's what, 3200 damage in a minute?
[131:17.81]Do them if they will live.
[131:19.69]If you have the talent, do agony.
[131:31.46]I just failed a quest, did I?
[131:32.84]I'm gonna I'm gonna hold on to some of this stuff.
[131:49.15]Okay, so if somebody needs something, should I just... So, light feathers.
[131:55.06]There are four people in the guild that say they want this.
[131:57.78]Should I just split this up?
[131:59.34]Send them each one feather.
[132:00.90]Yeah, just split it up and send each person two or three?
[132:03.74]And should I just be, hey, I saw you needed this?
[132:05.82]I feel like for me, if I got one feather, I'd be like, look at this guy.
[132:10.96]Is that a look at this guy moment?
[132:12.12]It actually might be.
[132:12.88]What about 10?
[132:13.24]Yeah, I was thinking like 10 to a stack.
[132:16.84]Anything like 10 or more.
[132:18.76]OK, but then who do I?
[132:19.54]OK, so let's see 1234.
[132:20.66]So I'm going to do a random number generator in my head.
[132:23.45]3.
[132:23.47]So yeah.
[132:30.33]Alright, I've got a stack of 10, so you send the one person.
[132:38.59]I'll send them to the other person.
[132:42.75]Then I saw you.
[132:45.03]Needed this.
[132:49.22]Good luck.
[132:55.84]I don't know.
[132:56.24]Just get chat GPT to write you something.
[132:58.14]Here's some cash, dude.
[133:00.92]There we go.
[133:12.04]I'm contributing.
[133:16.91]Anything else?
[133:44.64]What a good RP that was.
[133:46.54]Oh, shit.
[133:50.05]Saw you needed this.
[133:51.01]Good luck.
[133:54.81]That's like a... That was like a corporate email.
[133:57.97]The only thing that's missing is the signature on the bottom with like my business card at the very bottom.
[134:06.47]With like my name and, you know, my name and phone number and how you contact me and email.
[134:12.55]You're undead, right?
[134:13.59]So you just be like, um... Here are some feathers.
[134:16.67]I have no use for them.
[134:18.53]My sarcophagus is comfortable enough already, and I feel nothing.
[134:30.20]I was gonna be like... I am dead inside.
[134:32.40]What about these?
[134:32.96]These are kind of good.
[134:37.34]Is it annoying to, like, ask the guild about greens at this stage?
[134:42.45]Like, a level 9 green?
[134:44.37]Is that taking up a... Is that wasting bandwidth?
[134:48.23]Like, are you asking for them or asking if anyone wants them?
[134:51.71]I did this earlier and somebody wanted it.
[134:58.51]Feel free to reach out with any questions, yeah.
[135:07.26]Yeah, I feel like that's taking up like two kilobytes.
[135:10.72]There was like two or three times where I had a green recipe and I was like, anybody want this?
[135:14.49]And then it was just crickets.
[135:15.61]So I just started vendoring them if nobody put them on the wish list.
[135:19.81]I guess if the wish list does make sense, but a random green, sometimes you just never know if you want it or not.
[135:33.82]Put it into the guild bank.
[135:35.52]Do we have?
[135:35.92]I don't think we have access to the guild bank.
[135:37.82]I don't think there is a guild bank.
[135:39.26]No, I don't think we do.
[135:40.74]Like I don't.
[135:41.10]I don't think Vanilla WoW has guild banks.
[135:43.06]OK.
[135:53.45]I gotta get to level 18.
[135:56.81]Never hurts to ask.
[136:03.11]Oh, whatever, fine.
[136:04.36]Any, anyone...
[136:29.65]All right, I got it.
[136:30.89]Did it.
[136:32.02]Level nine.
[136:37.40]Hey, legal eagle.
[136:43.33]These are, okay.
[136:46.07]Uh, the only person who could use those are warriors.
[136:51.49]There's a level, there's a, I am the only person in the guild who's like under level 27 who can, who could possibly use those.
[136:58.32]All right.
[136:59.13]All right, well, hey.
[137:00.81]Hold on.
[137:01.25]Wait a second.
[137:01.85]No, mine are better.
[137:04.95]Mine are better.
[137:05.43]That'd be so funny if I actually ended up giving them to you because you're the one that could use them.
[137:11.54]It's like shamans can't use mail till 40.
[137:15.40]So it's like only warriors, right?
[137:17.14]And like paladins?
[137:18.04]Can paladins use... If we were alliance?
[137:19.81]Huh?
[137:20.63]Mail?
[137:21.39]This is...
[137:24.39]Yeah, this would be Paladin or Warrior.
[137:26.65]Yeah, nobody else going to use them.
[137:27.99]Yeah, I'll just Vendrum.
[137:38.22]Alright, I want to get to level...
[137:47.57]Alright, I'm going to fly to Ratchet.
[137:48.73]This will probably get me to level close to 18.
[137:50.83]Then we can get some abilities.
[137:53.74]And then we can see if I need to put the red X next to the level 19 or not.
[138:01.54]I'm not throwing in the towel yet.
[138:03.02]I'm just saying.
[138:03.86]I want to see how long it takes me to get from here to there and do it.
[138:06.32]Oh, we just missed Onyxia.
[138:21.99]would you do druid or hunter in classic uh hunter is probably easier and safer at least leveling wise druid can well the druid can kind of dance around in forms and druid actually is probably one of the safer ones right uh I've heard that a ton of druids die in hardcore hmm
[138:45.78]Hunter, you just get the pet.
[138:47.20]Any class with a pet is the one I'm going to recommend.
[138:49.70]Warlock or Hunter.
[138:52.74]Yeah, a couple of druids just kind of got sniped, right?
[139:00.91]They're the ones that kept getting just sniped out of the crowd.
[139:10.78]Unlucky.
[139:16.30]Have a good one.
[139:17.73]Keep it real.
[139:18.83]Have a good one.
[139:19.75]Be good.
[139:24.99]Shaman's the only... If Paladin was here, I'd be playing a Paladin.
[139:30.21]If anybody plays into TBC, if anybody cares at all at TBC, I'd play a Blood Elf Paladin.
[139:37.18]Or a... I don't know, probably.
[139:39.80]Although I really don't want to be Horde.
[139:40.90]I want to be Alliance.
[139:42.24]Alliance.
[139:44.38]I have heard, but not experienced myself, that TBC is so hard that they won't do hardcore.
[139:52.56]And everyone would just die, guaranteed, at the endgame.
[139:57.99]Yeah, but I mean... I like TBC and Wrath probably more than Classic.
[140:05.35]I actually think it would... To me, TBC and Wrath are Classic 2.0.
[140:22.80]I think the game was perfect around that era.
[140:31.32]I gotta get to the bank.
[140:32.34]I need to get another bag.
[140:33.19]I got, what, one level?
[140:35.63]I unlocked another bag slot.
[140:37.47]Good job, dude.
[140:38.17]Nice job, Jeremy.
[140:38.89]Okay.
[140:46.44]I need a little bit more.
[140:47.36]I'm going to kill these raptors up here and just get experience.
[140:50.94]Hey, didn't you mention having an extra bank?
[140:54.41]I do.
[140:54.77]Is there a bank in Ratchet?
[140:57.09]Yes, there is.
[140:58.33]Where is it?
[140:59.85]It's right by me.
[141:00.69]Hardcore Gruul or Nightbane would be hilarious.
[141:10.26]Yeah, aren't there some things in TBC that some people have to die?
[141:16.60]if you're not perfect perfect I mean I guess maybe I don't know now here I got this got this for you a nice big ass bag baby 14 slaughter talk to me hurry back huge yeah these are big be good
[141:50.29]Wrath is the final version of the game, in my opinion, after that point started to evolve.
[141:53.46]I completely agree.
[142:05.23]Then they hit Legion and I thought Legion was great.
[142:07.89]And then at Legion, Legion to me is what you're describing for retail.
[142:24.91]Because then retail after that just kind of... What, Warlords came out.
[142:30.37]People really didn't like it.
[142:31.99]It was... Wasn't that the thing with the garrisons and you could send people on mobile game missions and stuff?
[142:39.64]Oh, yeah.
[142:40.26]SWTOR had that.
[142:41.26]I don't know if they were the first ones, but I remember doing that in 2011.
[142:44.82]You would send, like, your companion out to go get crafting mats.
[142:52.94]Everyone judges the game based on when they left.
[142:55.16]Well, I didn't leave after Wrath.
[142:58.06]I stayed through Cataclysm.
[142:59.20]I stayed through Mists.
[143:00.94]I left after Mists.
[143:02.28]That's when I really didn't play the game anymore.
[143:06.92]I came back for Legion.
[143:08.70]And then I left again.
[143:10.13]And then really didn't play anything until very, very recently.
[143:27.04]We could do... Yeah, I still want to get the horns and get to 18.
[143:38.49]Have you played any retail besides, um, Legion?
[143:41.59]I have played nothing since we played Legion.
[143:44.51]Wow.
[143:46.59]We didn't even really do much.
[143:48.07]I remember doing like mythics at the end, like mythic dungeons.
[143:52.85]Well, that's pretty much all I remember.
[143:53.81]That's back when Styr played.
[143:55.17]Styr was playing with us in Legion.
[143:57.42]How crazy is that?
[143:58.08]Yeah, I think it was like a five-man, right?
[144:00.22]It was me, you, Boo, Stealth, and Styr.
[144:06.93]Yeah.
[144:07.47]You gotta imagine, if Styr is gonna play World of Warcraft, that's the good expansion then.
[144:15.89]Oh, shit, I have a pet.
[144:36.74]Oh, you gotta check this raptor.
[144:44.89]Oh, maybe this one over there.
[144:51.47]Didn't he hate it?
[144:52.13]And he cursed you all for making him play?
[144:56.15]Maybe.
[144:56.49]No, we did Mythics.
[144:59.13]It wouldn't be the first time, though.
[145:01.31]no he got he got max level we were doing mythics I I mean I think he enjoyed it for at least a little bit I mean he's not here to defend himself but you know I I think he I think he liked it a little
[145:32.31]raptor oh here's a good concentration of them not those ones though imagine streaming world of warcraft in 2017 no but that's seriously one of the best things I think that hardcore did was it just gave it an extra spice
[146:01.93]Yeah, like streaming retail WoW even now.
[146:06.63]The OTK crew there, they made WoW cool to stream.
[146:14.89]Like they made this Only Fangs thing such a big deal.
[146:17.57]And I didn't really care about WoW until they started doing it.
[146:21.18]Yeah, same.
[146:23.69]There were other big streamers that were doing World of Warcraft.
[146:26.71]But... This Only Fangs, especially with the T1 and... Hey, that's what grabbed me.
[146:33.07]And... I can't even imagine how difficult it's been to do all this.
[146:38.46]So... Those guys deserve a shitload of credit.
[146:42.12]They really do.
[146:43.80]What are there, a thousand fucking people in this guild?
[146:45.52]Of all streamers?
[146:47.36]Imagine having to put up with a thousand streamers.
[146:50.42]Guys, the House Flipper Tournament...
[146:52.28]was like 16 people.
[146:55.00]Imagine if it was a thousand.
[147:08.08]I got back into WoW, uh, because of Summit.
[147:11.49]So, that was, he was my influencer.
[147:16.77]A thousand narcissists.
[147:26.04]scheduling any of this yeah I hope so the heroes are the mods for sure yeah oh I got them all I'm good as a collective guild let's let's like send soda to like hawaii for like a month because their mods have been on point I think doing a lot of the organizational stuff behind the scenes
[147:55.91]Oh yeah, they've been great.
[148:12.69]This is going to make me 18.
[148:30.29]Yeah, I joined very, very late.
[148:33.75]I missed all the... all the RP stuff, and... But if they do it again, though, I'll be... I'll be absolutely ready to join at the beginning if they do another one.
[148:44.58]Yeah, because this is Only Things 2, right?
[148:47.24]Yeah.
[148:47.70]They're planning on doing a third one, I think.
[148:51.35]If they do.
[148:52.39]I'm sure that kind of depends on, like, whatever blizzards got planned, because... We were talking about this earlier.
[148:57.51]They've kind of adopted what was like a seasonal...
[149:01.43]release schedule for classic nice yeah they keep on just kind of cycling through it because we already did classic into tbc into ref and they're kind of just doing it again
[149:28.82]Nice.
[149:29.56]2.4 seconds.
[149:30.16]That'll bring it to 2.3.
[149:30.76]What's that?
[149:31.74]Alright, I'm gonna go learn my new moves.
[149:46.36]Yup, me too.
[149:48.98]But yeah, it seems like from what little I've seen of...
[149:58.37]The WoW rotation so far is kind of like, you've got the... the purest release, which I think the Anniversary Server kind of falls into.
[150:07.75]You've got the... get a little bit funky, which is, like, Season of Discovery.
[150:14.64]And then you've got the, okay, I get it, some people really don't like regular vanilla, and they want this expansion or whatever.
[150:22.44]So you've got, like, the Wrath people.
[150:27.91]Yeah, I almost wish that they would just keep a permanent TBC or a permanent Wrath.
[150:35.80]That's what I thought they were going to do, but they just, we're going to Cataclysm.
[150:38.62]We're going to go to Mists.
[150:41.02]Let's be really honest.
[150:42.62]Who the fuck is going to want to go from Mists forward?
[150:46.93]They're going to have to stop.
[150:47.91]Who wants like Warlords of Draenor classic?
[150:52.47]People wanted to run for the fucking hills for that game.
[150:56.91]There's no way they're going.
[150:58.32]I'm surprised they're even doing mists.
[150:59.78]People didn't miss was kind of.
[151:03.02]Pretty polarizing.
[151:04.56]I'm surprised he hates pandas.
[151:15.72]Mist was fun.
[151:17.54]I think I just don't like Mist because I just don't like what they did to the talent system.
[151:21.64]I know.
[151:22.32]It's completely meaningless and it's just literally... What if I just gave you the same tree and had you put five points in them?
[151:29.21]I know.
[151:31.43]Okay, on the World of Warcraft character creator screen, is there any choice below Panda for you?
[151:43.46]Um...
[151:47.71]Do I just hate pandas?
[151:49.55]Do I just not want to be a panda and I just don't want to be a panda?
[151:53.07]Is that what it is?
[151:56.31]Would you put Gnome above or below panda?
[151:59.83]Oh, way above.
[152:01.26]Okay, way above.
[152:02.46]But here's the thing.
[152:04.06]I thought the zones were wonderful.
[152:05.24]I thought the zones in Pandaria were wonderful.
[152:07.24]They were beautiful.
[152:08.74]All the cool architecture.
[152:09.94]It was so colorful.
[152:10.76]The mist zones were great.
[152:26.51]Retroactive appraisal is more positive than it was at the time.
[152:30.96]You know what?
[152:31.42]I'm going to be really, really interested in seeing if this keeps going, does that happen to Warlords?
[152:38.78]Do people go, no, Warlords was great.
[152:43.15]Warlords was a good ass expansion.
[152:45.79]Maybe that'll just keep happening.
[152:47.98]I think that a lot of that depends on what they release going forward.
[152:53.46]People saying there's no way.
[152:55.24]There's no way.
[152:59.23]Oh man.
[153:03.39]It's going to get, it's going to have rings of power.
[153:04.85]We talked about this the other day.
[153:05.93]Rings of power did that to the Hobbit.
[153:09.43]Yeah.
[153:13.24]I'm going to take my probably last break of the night.
[153:17.59]And then see where we can go in the next probably 45 minutes, hour.
[153:20.71]Oh, we're going to Wailing Caverns.
[153:24.09]We're not doing Wailing Caverns tonight.
[153:27.55]But this will be my last break of the night.
[153:30.43]Get up and move around.
[153:31.95]See you guys in a few minutes.
[153:34.71]And ads are going to play.
[154:07.99]I don't mind.
[154:09.93]It's honestly easier than you forgetting you turned on push to talk and then going silent for 25 minutes.
[154:42.78]Hey, what's up, chat?
[154:46.93]It's time for our regularly scheduled ad break.
[154:51.23]You think just because you're subscribed to Jerma985 that you're not gonna get any advertisements?
[154:56.15]Well, Totino's Pizza has something for you.
[155:03.77]The only two things safe from inflation in 2025 is Arizona iced tea and Totino's Pizza.
[155:19.14]one disc of cheesy pepperoni bread goodness all for you because it's not big enough to share in fact why don't you grab two because your local grocery store is selling ten for ten dollars we are trying to clear those shelves
[156:01.25]Tatino's pizza.
[156:04.60]Meat?
[156:05.48]Question mark.
[156:11.07]Imagine if the like box flavor was like meat question mark.
[156:47.46]What are you saying?
[156:48.54]Pizza?
[156:48.74]All right, we're back.
[157:04.96]Sorry.
[157:05.88]I want to apologize to Italics' stream.
[157:09.00]The last time we played, Italics wasn't live.
[157:11.61]And I just, like, my brain just melded the two days together.
[157:15.83]And I just forgot that you were actually live, so.
[157:20.87]Some say I shouldn't be.
[157:25.66]It doesn't matter.
[157:27.24]I'd rather you just leave the mic open because it makes it easier to snipe plus twos every so often.
[157:36.86]Are you following Italics yet?
[157:44.87]I think Italics has had at least three to five major plus two moments in the last couple of streams.
[157:52.65]Come on.
[157:53.35]Come on, Gwyn.
[157:53.91]All right, where's the... Down there.
[158:05.43]My chat's saying no.
[158:07.03]Is somebody fucking with me?
[158:37.18]Can't wait for Shadowburn.
[158:38.36]I love this spell.
[158:39.22]Reminds me of Shadow Ward Death without hurting yourself.
[158:41.41]It's awesome.
[158:46.93]I'm going the long way.
[159:19.10]I was gonna just take a swiftness potion to go catch that person.
[159:22.55]And that would have been such a waste of that.
[159:58.45]Hey, you can always tell when it's a confrontation.
[160:01.29]When somebody says, what's up?
[160:04.48]Hey, uh, what's up?
[160:06.14]Hey, sup?
[160:07.14]What's up?
[160:07.84]Yeah, if you say sup, it's like friendlier.
[160:10.16]Yeah.
[160:12.46]Yeah, what's up is... I'm mockerying this guy.
[160:19.50]That's not the right person.
[160:29.17]Anyway, thank you so much for the kind words and the shout out, but it's really naive of you to think I want any of your chatters over here.
[160:36.69]I'm just kidding.
[160:39.87]True.
[160:46.01]Two points.
[160:51.40]Italics hates us too.
[160:56.66]That's my secret.
[160:58.30]I hate everybody.
[161:01.36]No, you guys have been very good.
[161:03.34]You guys have been very well behaved, especially during the WoW streams.
[161:08.07]I hope it continues or I'm going to be very cross.
[161:10.97]Ooh.
[161:23.71]I got another five.
[161:24.51]Oops.
[161:25.11]I got a, what was the other one I got?
[161:26.57]Curse of Agony ranked two.
[161:27.59]I wanted to see what it did.
[161:29.85]Now this is useless.
[161:30.81]This is completely useless in hardcore.
[161:35.39]But if it's not hardcore, Soulstone is amazing.
[161:39.78]It just gives you an extra life like Super Mario.
[161:45.18]And you can give it to anybody.
[161:53.04]Although in hardcore, it doesn't do anything because when you're dead, you're just dead.
[161:57.44]But Curse of Agony rank two.
[161:58.72]Let's see.
[162:06.10]There it is.
[162:06.96]Searing Pain.
[162:07.66]Is Searing Pain bad?
[162:15.51]Like really bad?
[162:27.00]How much threat is a high amount of threat?
[162:42.29]Good damage, but it's great for finishing and pulling.
[162:45.91]You wouldn't want to use that during a boss fight or something, right?
[162:59.77]No, okay.
[163:00.45]So this is mainly... I wouldn't want this as part of a rotation then.
[163:05.21]But... So you can make it crazy though.
[163:09.25]Is this for PvP?
[163:19.24]Because that gives 10% more crit.
[163:22.20]Seems kind of insane.
[163:23.08]I'll just skip it, I guess.
[163:26.16]But it's still a cool move.
[163:28.56]For leveling, it's fine.
[163:36.20]Okay.
[163:39.20]Very cool.
[163:49.93]Okay.
[163:51.85]I want to do... I got to get my bars set up completely differently.
[163:59.21]Start with immolate.
[164:00.73]Shadow bolt.
[164:03.75]Searing pain on T. Okay.
[164:11.08]I'm not even going to put this on the bar.
[164:12.02]It doesn't do anything.
[164:15.35]Oh, Curse of Agony 2.
[164:17.87]180 shadow damage over 24.
[164:19.85]What is it now?
[164:22.51]That's so much better.
[164:30.22]I need to be way better about using this, though.
[164:31.86]Because it takes a long time to ramp it up.
[164:48.76]Are you both muted?
[164:50.20]Well, I don't want to like just talk.
[164:51.38]I realized I was potentially just talking over italics.
[164:54.67]It's like stream.
[165:03.39]Show all ranks in spellbook.
[165:05.53]Oh, good idea.
[165:15.40]All right.
[165:16.60]I think I'm good for like a little bit longer.
[165:19.72]How, um, how you feeling?
[165:20.78]Timing.
[165:26.68]I'm feeling good.
[165:27.80]Feeling good.
[165:28.16]How are you feeling?
[165:32.60]I'm feeling pretty good.
[165:33.20]Maybe like another 30, 40 minutes.
[165:35.20]I got like another half hour in me.
[165:39.74]We can probably do a quest or two.
[165:43.68]Baron's gaming?
[165:45.43]Sounds good to me.
[165:48.32]Ooh, nice.
[165:52.46]Wait.
[165:54.02]Does the imp already have this?
[165:55.12]I don't know.
[165:59.51]Do a dungeon?
[166:00.89]We'll do Wailing Caverns.
[166:03.65]There's a few people in the guild, I think, that are potentially at that level.
[166:09.25]I know that, um... I'm just going to assume every time you mute that you're thanking subs.
[166:16.85]uh what uh peekaboo died so peekaboo might speaking of thanking subs how many people are uh how about let me see I want to see the guild thing I don't like this because level 19 oh my god I'm so slow
[166:49.38]Well, I mean, like, Pika's not... How do I say this?
[166:56.96]Pika is not solving clock puzzles.
[167:02.30]I did spend about six hours staring at clocks.
[167:12.30]How do I... Oh, there we go.
[167:16.14]Who is on here?
[167:21.54]Damn, he is 19.
[167:27.71]He's a gamer, though.
[167:29.21]He's a gamer.
[167:29.73]Oh, he is a gamer, yeah.
[167:35.66]Alright, I'm going to head back to the barrens.
[167:39.40]I am on my way to the crossroads.
[167:46.24]But yes, I've seen the clips of Pika Makara-ing different people, and I would never challenge him.
[167:55.49]I saw... Do you know who Peyo is?
[168:00.57]Yeah.
[168:02.65]I watched Peyo play, and he was raiding.
[168:05.34]He was raiding in Molten Core.
[168:07.74]And then his screen went to a different Molten Core screen.
[168:15.23]Oh yeah, he's like doing two at once.
[168:17.73]Yeah, his screen went to a different screen of like PvP, like PvPing people in Booty Bay or something.
[168:26.12]I was like, holy shit, he's got three games going.
[168:28.64]He's in two raids and doing PvP.
[168:30.46]I was like, holy shit, this is fucking, this is awesome.
[168:33.72]First of all, he plays five versions at once.
[168:37.04]Oh my god, that's fucking insane.
[168:44.57]He's funny too.
[168:45.19]He's a funny guy.
[168:46.45]Some of those like early molten core raids, there was so much downtime that I can see how that could be possible.
[168:57.15]I can barely go like this to click minor healthstone.
[169:05.52]Let alone tabbing between two instances in two different dungeons.
[169:12.53]That's a. That's a whole nother level.
[169:30.49]Hey, it's probably got 50,000 plus hours.
[169:38.84]The two different raids is what was killing me though.
[169:40.66]I was, I was like laughing.
[169:42.46]So I was like, holy shit.
[169:43.72]He's, they like pulled Baron Geddon on one screen and he's in a different screen at like, like major Domo or something.
[169:52.62]That would be so stressful for me.
[170:07.71]Well, you are bad.
[170:10.22]that's fair I know plenty of people that aren't bad that I don't know if couldn't handle that I feel like the the main thing that people don't want to accept about hardcore wow is that it's harder than it looks like if you took the average chatter and just threw them into hardcore wow and say get to level 60 they wouldn't succeed
[170:36.33]WoW is a game solely about knowledge.
[170:39.87]The video game is not hard.
[170:42.59]Shooting shadow bolts at something and doing... It's two buttons.
[170:47.43]But the knowledge of the game is where you die and where it's a problem.
[170:51.93]Yeah, like once you have hundreds of hours, then it's pretty easy.
[170:56.87]And not knowing that certain things can pull, not knowing where things spawn.
[171:01.35]The whole game is a knowledge check.
[171:02.57]Every single second of it.
[171:25.38]But that's part of the fun though.
[171:30.60]Yeah, I think just jumping into hardcore is just a good way to do it.
[171:35.98]Because you'll be dying at like level 10 before it matters.
[171:40.72]Yeah.
[171:40.82]And going back to the regular game is going to feel like, okay, do you know when you train with weights on and then you train after a week, you take the weights off and you feel like Superman, you feel like you can watch Dragon Ball Z. Yeah.
[171:55.47]It's just having like, wait, it's like having training weights on.
[172:09.31]Piccolo walked so Rock Lee could run wait no that's not true Piccolo's better I actually never really saw very much of Dragon Ball I know I've had this conversation with you many times oh did you go to Ratchet?
[172:35.71]I did on accident
[172:40.39]Uh-oh.
[172:40.75]So I shouldn't follow you.
[172:41.75]I will correct that mistake.
[172:44.51]I think it doesn't matter.
[172:45.22]It's the same distance to go do all the things we're doing.
[172:48.34]You want to go kill the centaur?
[172:53.06]This varrog, the dervish, and get the dried seeds in that oasis down there.
[172:58.32]And then I think that could probably wrap it up.
[173:00.38]As a huge Dragon Ball Z fan, my hot take is that in 2025, if you've never seen it, it's unwatchable.
[173:09.93]like if you just started regular Dragon Ball Z having never seen it before like the basic show from the beginning even if you skip Dragon Ball and just go straight to Z you just it's not watchable I think the only way to consume Dragon Ball Z if you've never seen it before now is Kai or like the the funny one
[173:43.36]abridged you liked super though didn't you you thought super was good at that uh I never finished super it was like fun as somebody who already liked dragon ball z but if I didn't like dragon ball z already would never watch no I just realized we've had this person in our party for like in like two hours or something hey they're helping we're good
[174:16.13]I would say that the DBZ Kai is still a good version of the show.
[174:20.48]Unless if you stop after Cell Saga.
[174:24.86]Just skip Boo entirely.
[174:31.50]And why would you say that is?
[174:34.43]The actual objective reason is because the whole point of Kai was that they cut like a hundred episodes of filler and they just stopped cutting filler during the Boo saga.
[174:44.57]Hmm.
[174:47.15]so it's actually like twice as long as it needs to be yeah he hates mr satan uh no he's best character well there you go satan is the best character in dbz and unfortunately it's not his fault that you got to skip boo saga it's just it's the editors
[175:13.98]I only have one Funko pop and it's Mr. Satan.
[175:17.04]Okay.
[175:20.23]It's very pain is kind of cracked out though.
[175:22.37]Are we, are we going to ratchet?
[175:23.49]Are we not going to ratchet?
[175:25.91]You said, I'm going to correct that.
[175:27.25]And then you just didn't fly back and you started walking south instead.
[175:30.77]Oh, I said, we should kill.
[175:32.45]We should do it.
[175:32.89]Cause it's, it's the same distance.
[175:34.69]I think this a little oasis down here.
[175:54.61]This has not been on the entire time I've been playing.
[176:15.62]I think, is Searing Pain better than Shadowbolt right... I think it is right now.
[176:21.05]At this very second, I think it's better.
[176:22.39]Okay, to justify my position chat, the reason you should skip the entire Boo saga is so you don't have to watch 12 episodes of the Supreme Kai reading porn magazines while pointing his hand at Gohan to get mystical powers.
[176:37.56]Okay?
[176:41.38]That's all I gotta say.
[176:42.81]right what is your nightmare blunt rotation for dragon ball elaborate like what's the nightmare blunt rotation like who like a group of four passing the blunt around like like from the series or to watch it in real life no like in from the series
[177:13.32]Mine is Mr. Satan.
[177:15.64]Uh, the boo that goes, the Elmo boo.
[177:20.72]Uh, Mr. Satan, Elmo boo, and, um, not Beerus.
[177:29.34]Beerus is powerful friend.
[177:32.46]Beerus is the only reason to watch Super.
[177:36.14]Like, you would enjoy watching Dragon Ball Super even if you skipped Z because Beerus is in it.
[177:44.63]True.
[177:49.57]No, I don't want... No, not Vegeta.
[177:56.20]Vegeta just probably wouldn't just stop talking.
[177:57.90]Wouldn't not shut up about the asteroid coming and how he needs to stop it.
[178:02.08]Oh, you don't understand the... The asteroid's coming!
[178:05.79]We need to stop it!
[178:07.93]Okay, um, I'd pick... Um...
[178:15.39]Zarbon?
[178:17.57]That's a good one.
[178:21.46]That'd be first pick.
[178:24.46]I would go Saiyan Ape form Vegeta.
[178:35.55]I would pick Android 17.
[178:36.91]Oh, no, no.
[178:37.45]I don't know.
[178:39.33]16 and 17.
[178:40.03]I would let them rock, paper, scissors for that spot because it can't be both.
[178:49.97]and then the fourth one is a tough one is that you didn't get to come down here and touch I would say goku's tail
[179:16.35]I feel like, um, Vegeta's the one that would show you, like, Twitter videos of people fighting.
[179:21.47]Nah, I actually pick... I pick Vegito.
[179:25.38]Vegito was, like, my favorite character when I was a kid.
[179:29.74]Even though I think he, like, sucks now.
[179:37.38]What do you think is the worst character in Dragon Ball?
[179:40.51]Uh, Master Roshi.
[179:44.39]I don't even have to think about it.
[179:45.51]Ha ha ha!
[179:46.76]wait hold on I I've never seen it but is master roshi the one that goes like this oh goku you need to make sure your training is not complete sound like does it sound like that it's not really like how he sounds it's just he's he's the reason why it's very very hard to watch dragon ball z in 2025. he's um unpleasant
[180:16.58]okay he's unpleasant that is such a polite way to shit talk anybody well let's just say they're uh yeah well they're unpleasant I think what does he spawn they spawn here
[180:45.09]How many spots do we got?
[180:45.73]Oh shit.
[180:46.07]We have two groups of three here.
[180:46.97]Uh oh.
[181:16.42]What about the others?
[181:21.95]I just didn't realize who this even was.
[181:29.87]Oh no, it's just you.
[181:31.61]It's just you.
[181:33.60]I didn't invite him.
[181:37.92]I don't know.
[181:38.90]I thought I had more than one spot.
[182:10.58]kill the surrounding Mr. Satan definitely still the best character he'd have to be there yeah I've only seen clips and whatever you've shown me
[182:33.78]I was probably, like, watching it sometimes at the old house, no doubt.
[182:38.62]I think I was watching Super there.
[182:41.18]Was Super that long ago?
[182:44.89]2019, 2018?
[182:45.97]It's pretty old, right?
[182:51.95]We're old.
[182:54.21]Yeah.
[182:56.17]Story of my life.
[183:14.27]2019 was two years ago.
[183:15.25]Yeah, COVID just time warped everybody.
[183:24.40]Just skipped three years, I think, for every single person.
[183:35.67]Yeah, there's, uh... There's... That was, like, the biggest bookmark in everybody's lives that there hasn't...
[183:44.42]Like the last four or five years, something significant would have to have happened in like your personal life for you to remember time because it hasn't been anything else.
[183:53.25]It's like creating a divider in your brain.
[183:56.81]All right.
[184:01.95]We got, we got, we got some competition here.
[184:04.77]Oh no.
[184:08.93]This might be a do it later.
[184:12.99]We could layer too.
[184:18.48]Maybe we should layer and just get away from this shit show.
[184:20.38]This is like three groups here, I think.
[184:24.90]Yeah, let's just layer.
[184:41.16]I definitely don't want to layer right next to this.
[184:43.86]Maybe like up here.
[184:46.88]Where is a safe place to layer?
[184:48.00]Maybe like right here?
[185:11.51]Did we get like a hyena?
[185:16.98]All right.
[185:18.88]Need a lair.
[185:19.32]Should I ask in the guild?
[185:23.07]Yeah, I was just asking guild.
[185:25.61]They just summoned them, but they're already fighting them.
[185:47.48]Thank you, thank you.
[186:07.69]All right, what do we got?
[186:09.73]Better or worse?
[186:11.91]Oh, there's definitely fewer people, but there's a bunch of bodies.
[186:25.18]I think someone said for this quest we have to like kill Kolkar and then he's summoned which makes it even harder because you have to like go somewhere else kill and then get back here before someone else tags it or something there's a lot in this area here just gotta get a number of kills okay
[186:59.23]I like searing pain.
[187:00.13]It's just like a little... It's a little stab.
[187:02.59]It's just a little sting.
[187:07.67]You good?
[187:16.64]I already know what you're gonna write.
[187:17.76]They're like, stop to ask.
[187:24.00]Yeah, you can tell when they do this.
[187:30.25]Like, stop right in front of you and start typing?
[187:32.29]Just a dead stop.
[187:33.91]Nobody dead stops in World of Warcraft.
[187:36.55]Everybody does this.
[187:37.19]Yeah, you're just, like, jumping back and forth, strafing circles.
[187:40.67]Mm-hmm.
[187:44.05]Dead stop is I am vigorously typing.
[187:46.34]Probably should kill some more.
[188:00.22]yes it's killing a centaur and an alarm will be raised searing pain
[188:31.79]Oh, they didn't even roll for the chest.
[188:33.49]They just started opening it.
[188:38.83]Can we roll for this?
[188:40.27]What the heck?
[188:40.71]Oh, someone's... Invite this guy.
[188:42.63]Invite... Invite, uh... Tarnivore.
[188:45.25]Tarnivore.
[188:45.77]Invite Tarnivore.
[188:46.67]I can't.
[188:48.43]I don't know who that is.
[188:49.71]Tarn, this guy right here.
[188:50.61]This guy.
[188:51.11]He's dead.
[188:51.81]I was too far away.
[188:53.69]I couldn't see who it was.
[188:54.47]Fuck.
[188:57.29]Fuck.
[189:01.00]Hey, well, what about that chest?
[189:14.79]Is that why you were back here the whole time?
[189:16.71]I was.
[189:17.27]You have to roll for it.
[189:25.35]Patrol?
[189:27.43]Harthing?
[189:33.78]You can have it.
[189:47.24]It's a bunch of garbage.
[189:50.43]Now we gotta wait like 40 minutes for that guy to come back.
[189:58.43]The thing that I said could happen, happened.
[190:00.51]Yeah, we walked away for 10 seconds.
[190:12.97]I thought he was supposed to like yell oh no he did he did yell shit he yells like I am summoned intruders come to my tent and face your death that could have been a dragon ball character apparently you can join a lair if you just type slash join lair
[190:41.64]Is that an add-on thing?
[190:43.66]I don't know.
[190:44.60]I've never heard of that before.
[190:52.06]Did it work?
[190:54.72]I would imagine it probably have to be in not enough party.
[190:59.10]Oh, somebody's saying jubate.
[191:05.54]Take a different shot.
[191:06.21]Yeah, so there are
[191:09.09]uh like 10 parallel universes at the same time right now on top of each other on the same realm it's a different instance that probably what five to ten thousand people per player I would imagine something like that uh does it change like when you go into major cities and stuff
[191:33.47]I don't know what the algorithm is that changes it, but I think it happens sometimes on the fly too.
[191:41.37]And whether, like you said, that's a major city or if an area is very populated, maybe it'll put you on a different one.
[191:47.19]If the other one's not as populated, I don't know.
[191:51.99]It's an add-on that auto-layers you by typing that.
[191:55.98]Wait, look into that.
[192:05.71]Oh, this guy just got that shit.
[192:07.43]It was like a piece of leather and a banana.
[192:10.95]I feel bad.
[192:13.29]You never leave chests because somebody will do that and be excited and there's just a piece of Swiss cheese in there.
[192:20.00]That's what I give out to all the kids on Halloween.
[192:35.56]I don't even know why I'm casting agony right now.
[192:45.72]They're not even alive for three seconds.
[192:51.68]That spell isn't ready yet.
[193:20.74]Do you do regular meetups with Only Fangs?
[193:24.22]I think that's the point, yeah.
[193:25.76]If anybody's low enough, I mean, at this point, I think we've talked about it a couple times, but there's not very many people that are running through the Barrens right now in Only Fangs.
[193:35.69]There's a handful.
[193:36.25]I think a little bit later, maybe, some of the people that have alts are in the 20s and 30s.
[193:45.38]but might be a little bit behind everybody but it's all right I've got an alt in the 20s I'm just here for the fun I just wanted to participate it was really cool really fun I just kind of wanted to hang out and do it it's kind of one of those things if you want to do it anyway you may as well also do it while in the guild
[194:13.53]Yeah, and I've wanted to play Classic off and on here.
[194:16.89]And then, like I said, all this stuff with Only Fangs is just given the reason to maybe get more interested in WoW, especially WoW Classic.
[194:27.66]I'm all for it.
[194:35.74]I've ever heard of Motor Town behind the wheel.
[194:37.60]Yes, I want to play it.
[194:38.98]I own it.
[194:39.58]I bought it.
[194:40.68]I'm ready to stream it.
[194:42.58]It's just going to have to be probably next week because we're going to do there's a couple of things that I'm going to do before.
[194:56.64]Waiting for these leaders to spawn is like waiting for your like friend to get online so you can play.
[195:04.65]Classic spawn rates.
[195:17.62]Is this guy gonna announce his... bullshit or what?
[195:53.89]For all we know, somebody just killed him on this layer before we got here.
[196:05.01]That means he's about to spawn any second now.
[196:26.11]Okay.
[197:24.23]What?
[197:24.43]I don't know
[198:11.37]the other dude just said like last time I was here my character died and then you wrote that uh we should probably get everybody yeah that sounds delicious
[198:40.32]I love how helpful, you know, WoW players, especially WoW classic hardcore players, in the open, everybody's just so nice to each other.
[198:57.07]Everybody's so nice.
[199:05.23]Not in dungeons.
[199:06.21]Yeah, but that's what it means.
[199:07.05]If you stay out of the dungeons, and you just tell people about your Super Bowl party, you're gonna have all the friends in the world.
[199:18.86]How come you only made stuffing, cranberry, turkey, and then potatoes?
[199:25.81]That's just turkey and potatoes.
[199:28.71]Stuffing?
[199:29.83]Turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes.
[199:32.38]But the cranberry and the stuffing is all just like turkey adjacent, right?
[199:37.92]Well, I mean, I'm not going to make a green bean casserole.
[199:57.67]This keyboard, I'm telling you, is something wrong with it.
[200:10.62]You saw that in real time.
[200:13.30]Whenever I press A, sometimes it just presses the caps lock button.
[200:17.45]I'm not pressing caps lock, I promise.
[200:24.69]There we go.
[200:25.93]Anybody need an invite?
[200:26.81]We're good?
[200:28.85]We're your full party, so... That guy died before I even could look over here and attack him.
[200:59.24]Crossroads?
[201:01.02]Ooh, the hearth is up.
[201:02.30]I think we have two turn-ins here, right?
[201:08.36]Oh, nope.
[201:10.26]It is actually... Well, no, crossroads is easier just to... Yeah, just go to crossroads.
[201:18.30]Going to crossroads.
[201:26.73]I'm going to lead that party.
[201:34.25]We just hearthed like a hundred feet.
[201:37.05]Hey, hearthstone is for convenience, not for travel.
[201:39.79]I will die on that hill.
[201:58.05]Then we got to go to that little bunker over there.
[202:11.01]Oh, the horde outpost.
[202:14.11]Oh wait, yeah, that one too.
[202:15.21]Yeah, it's that little.
[202:20.51]To the West of the crossroads on the road where that scary hut is with all the.
[202:26.52]Centaurs in the boss elite.
[202:37.31]And then whatever is the part after this, I'm probably going to call it here.
[202:52.87]downloaded wow I'm completely new to the game you think I'll still be able to get the full wow experience absolutely yeah
[203:38.32]What's that?
[203:40.08]Damn, that's actually nasty.
[203:45.55]Seven agility rings?
[203:47.39]That thing is... That thing's actually crazy, though.
[203:55.61]Level 28 just be like, uh, use it for my ult.
[204:02.80]Actually, my shaman could probably use it.
[204:08.84]But I don't want to.
[204:09.60]I don't want to be the guy.
[204:13.74]So this is it.
[204:14.48]This is where we got to.
[204:17.50]You get the ring and then you do the last part.
[204:24.44]Where is he down?
[204:25.16]Oh, he's over here.
[204:32.97]Alright, that's good though.
[204:34.99]Probably going to call it here.
[204:47.11]You missed the part where I had a 9 to 5?
[204:50.51]Oh, you're asking, could you do this with a 9 to 5?
[204:55.92]This is the best game to play.
[204:57.34]Halfway to level 19?
[205:02.10]Yeah, we got, like, a full level and a half.
[205:08.02]The funny thing about Classic WoW is that, like, slide where the first day, it's like, oh, yeah, level one to 12, easy.
[205:16.32]Day two is, like, 12 to 16, and then day three is like, okay, yeah, level and a half is pretty good.
[205:24.28]Yeah, usually doing one to two levels a day is... And if you're playing for... I mean, we're playing very casually, but...
[205:32.63]Usually trying to get like one to three levels a day is what people typically try to go for.
[205:36.15]Yeah, I think World of Warcraft, I think this is one of the better games to play.
[205:48.70]Somebody asked if they had a 9 to 5, can they still do it?
[205:52.00]This is the greatest game to just open for a few hours to do anything.
[205:55.72]You could go make bags and level up your professions for an hour and that's all you do.
[206:02.55]yeah I mean when it first came out I was like 14 or 15 or something and playing it you know when you have free time not at school and it probably took me like six to eight months to get to level cap the first time just because you just get on when you have a couple hours to dick around yeah it's it's like arguably the best version of that experience it's you can be as low key or as high key as you want in this game
[206:41.03]These are really good too.
[206:41.93]These are actually really good.
[206:44.13]Are these good for you?
[206:49.59]What is it?
[206:50.83]Oh, bracers with the monkey?
[206:52.91]They're not male, but.
[206:54.15]Uh, I mean, stat wise, they're good, which is more important than armor.
[207:01.88]I think at this point I think I have minor plus one strength at the moment.
[207:06.76]You can, uh, you can take them.
[207:13.01]Oh, that's an extra 30 health.
[207:17.25]Yep.
[207:17.47]Very nice.
[207:54.58]One defense.
[207:56.70]What do you have for a cloak?
[207:59.88]I've got two strength, two agility.
[208:01.38]Yeah, this thing's a piece of shit.
[208:09.43]These are weird too.
[208:10.57]One strength, stamina, spirit.
[208:12.95]Cloth.
[208:13.29]Who would use this?
[208:17.28]Druid?
[208:17.56]Druid?
[208:30.22]I don't know well that's fun slowly but surely the turtle will cross level 30. yeah one I'm gonna have a decision to make once you get up there because I'm like I don't know if I want to I have to make
[208:58.01]the which one's the main and which one's the alt decision just locking in on this guy I don't know if I'd rather do shaman pass 30 or if I'd rather do warrior shaman is better if the goal is actually raiding shaman probably is some of the most fun
[209:24.34]because I remember them saying in one of the early meetings like if if you have a shaman you have more raid spots and the people fighting over like warrior loot is crazy there's just a lot of warriors best class in the game
[209:55.53]as always it was fun dude yeah it was a good time glad you uh I'm sorry that I uh told you it was gonna be yeah I told I was like hey it's gonna be like maybe a couple hours maybe I gotta finish nancy drew and then I'm you know I'll do a couple maybe do some tailoring for a minute four and a half hours later you're watching me in a smoke-filled room screaming at clocks and that is not an exaggeration
[210:18.46]No, it's all good.
[210:19.56]I was just trying to catch up.
[210:22.54]I hadn't played the other character in a couple weeks, so I had to figure out what the buttons did.
[210:26.53]So I was just doing some crafting, fishing, all that fun stuff that we were just talking about that you can just waste so much time in World of Warcraft doing.
[210:37.69]It's a fun game.
[210:38.25]All right, dude.
[210:42.03]Until next time, definitely we'll see you again.
[210:44.23]We'll do Wailing Caverns probably next time, I imagine.
[210:47.97]or close to it dude well good night German chat I'm probably also gonna be done because I am tired and you've for the first time in probably 10 years have a longer stream than me that is probably only because I did Nancy Drew yeah good to see you talk soon dude all right good night bye-bye
[211:21.59]Alrighty.
[211:24.65]Well, I'm gonna have to put a red X next to level 19.
[211:27.73]Nancy Drew took too long.
[211:32.50]Oh my God, what about my clothes in the dryer?
[211:34.76]Yeah, take care guys.
[211:48.05]See you soon.
[211:49.57]Have a good rest of your day.
[211:52.16]And the next time you see me will be on Friday.
[211:56.56]I don't think I'm going to do anything tomorrow.
[212:05.41]Friday is Monster Hunter Wilds.
[212:10.87]And we'll be playing that with, I believe, Stir, Vinny, and Poke.
[212:18.54]And then if I'm liking it, if I think it's good, if I enjoyed it, maybe we'll do kind of a Monster Hunter Wilds WoW stuff.
[212:26.22]I know Italics has mentioned playing it too, so just people to play it with.
[212:31.78]Two games to get painfully addicted to.
[212:34.48]Yeah, see you on Friday.
[212:43.86]I don't think there'll be a surprise stream tomorrow.
[212:49.82]But I've been known to lie before.
[212:51.14]But at the very least, see you Friday.
[212:53.85]I don't know when we're starting.
[212:55.15]I'm going to have to see what they want to do.
[212:57.93]But keep an eye on this house over the next day or two.
[213:02.17]Take care.
[213:02.60]Call your mother.
[213:03.10]See you later.
[213:03.58]Have a good rest of your night.
[213:06.62]See you soon.
[213:17.21]you
