[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.21]Hey, pay no attention to all the dropped frames right now.
[00:10.70]Don't worry about that.
[00:13.32]It's because I had to re-download all of the DLC again.
[00:20.08]Remember, I came in here and I was like, hey, no, it looks like that wasn't the problem.
[00:23.43]I was too embarrassed to come back and tell you that that's what was happening.
[00:28.79]I had to re-download the DLC again.
[00:32.66]And I was like, no, it's all good.
[00:34.08]I didn't have to do that.
[00:35.66]I restarted Steam and started... And the download started again.
[00:40.32]So, we have about two minutes before I can open Hitman 2.
[00:45.14]I was like, should I come in there?
[00:46.28]Are people going to laugh at me when I tell them this?
[00:48.49]Probably.
[00:50.57]Why am I using so much CPU right now?
[00:52.73]Hitman's not even open.
[00:58.69]Why am I dropping so many?
[01:02.20]What?
[01:02.54]Hold on.
[01:05.08]What's going on with my computer?
[01:10.79]I'm at 50% CPU.
[01:12.21]I'm not doing anything.
[01:13.85]Hold on a second.
[01:20.09]Oh, this is not... Watch me burn out my CPU.
[01:26.08]Now I'm going to have Hitman open when I'm already at 50%.
[01:31.07]Am I installing a Windows update?
[01:33.27]Oh, it's because it's installing Hitman.
[01:34.71]Does that take CPU?
[01:37.87]No, it doesn't.
[01:38.93]That uses HDD.
[01:41.81]That uses hard disk drive.
[01:43.71]That doesn't use that much CPU, does it?
[01:52.00]HDD in 2019.
[01:55.76]You think I got any moving parts in this thing?
[01:57.82]I got all SD.
[02:00.74]That's how you know that was a funny lie.
[02:05.54]HDD.
[02:07.20]But I'm going to refill this.
[02:10.06]I'm going to get some good stalling content here.
[02:13.85]I've got to refill this water.
[02:15.77]Let me just stall for another 45 seconds.
[02:18.77]I've got to tweet it too.
[02:19.55]Didn't tweet?
[02:20.77]We're going to do the Hitman 2D.
[02:21.71]No, wait, wait, wait.
[02:24.04]Let's talk for a minute before I go do that.
[02:27.04]So today is the day before TwitchCon.
[02:30.25]And some might say that TwitchCon actually starts today.
[02:34.19]So this is the last stream you're going to see from me until I am back from TwitchCon.
[02:40.92]A lot of moving around here the last two weeks of September.
[02:45.12]So...
[02:47.14]This stream is only going to be a few hours long.
[02:49.30]We're going to do the Hitman 2 DLC campaigns.
[02:52.09]I have not done the last one.
[02:54.21]So we'll see how long that takes.
[02:56.05]After that, I gotta go.
[02:58.99]There's still a few things that I have to take care of before getting on another plane and leaving for four days.
[03:06.80]Technically three, right?
[03:08.02]Whatever it is.
[03:09.32]But, give me one second.
[03:10.84]I'm going to fill this drink up and then we'll play Hitman 2.
[03:14.62]Be right back.
[03:15.28]And I'm going to tweet that.
[03:15.94]See you in a minute.
[04:27.79]Okay.
[04:29.47]Yeah, yes, I've seen the new Twitch.
[04:34.69]I made this reference earlier, but I'm going to make it again.
[04:36.77]It is... It is the World of Warcraft chat.
[04:45.71]Especially when you go into all caps.
[04:48.77]I don't know what the WoW chat is, whatever, I'm of the opinion.
[04:54.76]Why on Earth would you ever, under any circumstance, and I'm not talking about Twitch, I'm just saying ever in general, why are there so many fonts?
[05:01.16]12 to 14 point Helvetica is the only thing there should be, why would there ever be another font?
[05:13.97]Do we need... 16, 17, 18... How many fonts are there?
[05:18.85]1800?
[05:19.27]How many fonts exist?
[05:22.48]It's probably thousands of them.
[05:25.74]What's the point?
[05:31.76]There are millions of fonts.
[05:32.96]Why?
[05:35.10]Is it... There are only three fonts that should exist.
[05:41.27]Reading things... Clearly...
[05:45.13]Birthday card.
[05:46.74]You can be fun with that one.
[05:47.82]Birthday card.
[05:51.68]That's it.
[05:55.06]I can't think of another reason to ever have another font.
[06:00.55]There's no other reason for other fonts besides those two.
[06:07.59]Alright, rip Times New Roman.
[06:11.17]No, that one doesn't even have to exist either!
[06:19.65]This should not be more fonts than there are cereal brands.
[06:24.55]Something about that is not correct.
[06:28.80]They can't even figure out how to make cornflakes fucking 500 times.
[06:32.38]They've only made it like 30 times.
[06:36.42]How do you make the letter H look 6 million times different than the last time you made it?
[06:43.75]You can't!
[06:44.31]It's just three lines!
[06:46.81]It's one, two, three lines!
[06:53.45]Anyways, before I get all worked up.
[06:55.97]We're going to play Hitman now.
[06:58.43]I have the audio muted, so you shouldn't be able to hear it.
[07:00.57]It shouldn't hurt your ears.
[07:08.88]Make my own font.
[07:10.86]It would just be a few lines.
[07:12.94]You shouldn't be able to hear this.
[07:20.28]Hold on, not yet.
[07:22.60]Hold on.
[07:25.29]Not yet.
[07:26.81]Now I have to do this fun thing where, oh God, where's my mouse?
[07:29.86]Why is the Windows thing open?
[07:31.54]Close that, please.
[07:32.98]Don't turn off my computer.
[07:34.34]Okay, we're starting strong here, okay.
[07:38.06]Here we go.
[07:38.44]Turn that off.
[07:43.52]Just give me one moment, nice transition there.
[07:45.66]I have to get this captured.
[07:51.87]Alright, let's get it.
[07:54.43]Do not capture goose game.
[07:55.99]I want Hitman 2.
[07:58.27]Done.
[08:00.41]There we are.
[08:02.33]You thought it was going to take me longer.
[08:03.55]It may have.
[08:06.66]Alright, I got the DLC installed.
[08:07.92]Hopefully it works.
[08:09.32]Otherwise I'm going to be very sad.
[08:15.30]Stop sweating and turn on facecam.
[08:18.86]Though.
[08:19.64]Cut my nails though.
[08:20.50]I did do that.
[08:22.82]Those of you that were
[08:25.60]Yelling at me last night at the end of that stream.
[08:27.93]I appreciate it.
[08:30.55]So there's two DLC campaigns.
[08:32.21]There's two missions that I haven't done.
[08:34.73]Right?
[08:39.37]Campaign.
[08:40.69]Hitman 2.
[08:42.37]I did all these already.
[08:46.02]So Golden Handshake and The Last Resort.
[08:48.94]Alright.
[08:51.32]Alright.
[08:53.15]Remember to shave?
[08:54.69]Already did.
[08:55.61]You don't think I was already on top of that?
[08:59.12]I had to shave to the minute.
[09:02.32]that the Twitch party is going to start on Saturday.
[09:05.14]I shaved it exactly 7.30 p.m.
[09:08.52]last night.
[09:08.92]That's a lie because I was still alive.
[09:11.34]When did the stream end?
[09:12.46]Like 8.30 p.m.
[09:14.20]Pacific?
[09:15.22]That's when the Twitch party starts.
[09:16.32]It's going to grow out.
[09:17.97]When I'm in the Uber to get there, it is going to be perfectly grown out.
[09:22.79]The last second when I step out of that cab.
[09:26.25]Perfectly grown.
[09:30.46]So this one is brand new.
[09:31.62]This one is not.
[09:32.28]This one is probably like a few months old.
[09:37.24]By the way, those of you that are going to laugh at me for this, I have not played Hitman since the last time I streamed it.
[09:45.60]I don't even remember how to play.
[09:50.15]So that's going to be a thing.
[09:56.29]Bad, bad.
[09:57.31]I haven't played in like a year.
[10:02.04]I forget what happened.
[10:26.74]This is a whole game here.
[10:29.00]Yeah, I'll turn the volume up in a sec.
[10:31.22]I have to pay attention to this, though.
[10:33.84]Is that Troy Baker?
[10:34.42]That's Troy Baker, right?
[11:00.05]milton fitzpatrick the investment bank you can always tell when it's troy baker because he elongates words the director of the New York branch is a Providence operator it's our best bet as a way in I'm not nearly as talented as troy baker I'm just telling you
[11:20.44]Alright, let's go.
[11:21.70]You don't need to tell us.
[11:23.92]I'm just telling you.
[11:46.32]Lore snore.
[11:47.32]Wait, I gotta pay, look, I gotta pay attention.
[11:50.45]I can go through the basement.
[11:51.45]Mm-hmm.
[11:51.65]Right.
[11:51.81]So I gotta get three flash drives.
[12:08.91]And then they combine.
[12:09.91]We cannot risk the partners discovering the data breach.
[12:12.75]I'm going in through the basement.
[12:13.79]The bank's director, Athena Savalas, would sever the last remaining Providence tied to the bank and keep our activities hidden.
[12:22.17]Okay.
[12:23.05]One more time.
[12:24.69]Give it to me clear.
[12:25.35]We break into the vault, extract the hard drive rack, and get rid of the director.
[12:31.20]We.
[12:32.98]You.
[12:34.22]Good luck, 47.
[12:36.30]Okay.
[12:37.84]Break into the hard drive.
[12:39.41]Steal the bank.
[12:41.87]Break into the... Alright.
[12:43.25]Break the director.
[12:44.67]Steal the bank.
[12:49.03]Eliminate.
[12:50.79]Athena Savalas.
[12:53.49]Mission is now active.
[12:57.01]How do you swing?
[12:57.93]I think it's a Q. Sound is too low.
[13:03.62]I got it.
[13:03.92]I got it.
[13:04.18]I got it.
[13:04.54]Just hold on.
[13:14.86]It's Q-R-S.
[13:17.45]Okay.
[13:17.95]Objective.
[13:20.07]Target Athena Savalas.
[13:21.73]Retrieve the data and exit the bank.
[13:24.41]I gotta get the data?
[13:27.05]Difficulty professional.
[13:29.81]That has to change.
[13:32.41]Wait, no.
[13:32.85]That's what I played on before, right?
[13:34.11]Okay.
[13:35.07]I'm gonna be the New Yorker.
[13:36.38]Don't I have any DLC suits?
[13:44.35]Why is this taking so long?
[13:52.25]Should I just go for the eye?
[13:53.19]I'm going to go into the winter sports suit.
[13:55.69]I think.
[13:58.17]I won't look out of place at all.
[14:03.06]Okay, coin, that's good.
[14:04.66]My concealed weapon is my ICA-19.
[14:07.10]That looks alright.
[14:09.06]Starting location, bank entrance.
[14:11.38]I think I'm ready to go.
[14:13.06]Pray for my CPU, because the last time I played this game, it was all fucked up.
[14:18.49]Difficulty master?
[14:19.69]No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[14:20.93]Professional, okay.
[14:23.05]Here we go.
[14:24.50]And I'm gonna turn it up a little bit louder.
[14:29.52]That should do it.
[14:31.47]Hey, now you can hear.
[14:32.96]Let's go!
[14:48.08]I forget.
[14:48.40]What's the plan?
[14:50.12]Welcome to New York, 47.
[14:51.44]I'll get it again.
[14:52.86]Milton Fitzpatrick Bank is open for business, but it seems there's some sort of investigation underway.
[14:58.91]Expect increased security.
[15:02.54]Your target, Director Athena Savalas, can be found in her top floor office, overlooking the iconic Teller Hall.
[15:08.90]Stop chugging.
[15:09.46]What are you talking about?
[15:10.51]Head of security, Mateo Perez, is roaming between the vault area and the Teller Hall, talking to employees.
[15:16.37]What are you talking about?
[15:17.21]What?
[15:18.23]And head of accounts, Fabian Mann, can be found on the investment banker floor and the top floor of the bank, driving the internal investigation.
[15:25.99]That shouldn't be happening.
[15:27.64]This is a lie.
[15:28.96]I'm supposed to pay attention to this.
[15:30.14]Okay.
[15:30.34]Now I lost everything.
[15:31.16]Hold on.
[15:31.88]Are you guys actually fucking with me?
[15:34.16]Oh no.
[15:57.30]Oh, no.
[15:58.40]You weren't.
[16:00.82]Were you?
[16:02.16]I have to keep this out.
[16:03.10]They didn't see this.
[16:05.90]Oh, shit.
[16:06.82]Alright.
[16:07.88]God damn it.
[16:09.62]Why does my computer have to suck so bad?
[16:11.79]Alright, what do I... Let me save it.
[16:24.44]Uh, manual save slot.
[16:25.58]How about... None of these matter.
[16:27.48]This one right here.
[16:30.42]Okay.
[16:32.56]Eliminate Athena Savalas and obtain the data.
[16:35.54]You got it.
[16:39.04]I need to... I don't remember how to play.
[16:43.46]That's Q. Uh, retrieve vault data core.
[16:51.31]Three of them.
[16:56.68]Those of you that are wondering why I did this, I'm making sure my CPU can handle it.
[17:11.92]Okay, I can handle it.
[17:21.50]Maybe, no, it can't.
[17:26.85]It can't handle it?
[17:29.81]It wasn't silky smooth?
[17:34.91]Wait, that wasn't silky smooth?
[17:44.75]What?
[17:49.36]Fuck!
[17:50.62]God damn it!
[17:52.56]No!
[17:56.72]Hold on.
[17:57.60]Hold on a second.
[17:58.54]I might have to restart the stream.
[18:07.72]Can I do that during the stream?
[18:12.75]Hold on a minute.
[18:18.15]Shit!
[18:20.11]Shit, shit, shit, shit!
[18:21.65]Damn it!
[18:22.89]No!
[18:24.47]It's because... I have to restart the stream.
[18:27.76]Alright, I'll be right back.
[18:29.46]It's because... Last time I played a console game, I turned my CPU preset down.
[18:37.38]And shit.
[18:39.10]I'll be right back.
[18:41.12]Like, in 10 seconds.
[18:47.50]Alright.
[18:48.54]We're good.
[18:50.24]We're good, right?
[18:50.90]I think we're good.
[18:52.64]Hey.
[18:53.56]How's everybody doing?
[18:58.76]Did it work?
[19:00.87]Confirm with me that this worked.
[19:08.73]Yes, it did it.
[19:09.47]Yeah.
[19:10.09]I have my CPU preset so fucking high.
[19:12.83]So low, I mean.
[19:13.64]Alright.
[19:14.26]Okay.
[19:14.80]Hopefully not a thousand of you left.
[19:16.50]You probably did.
[19:17.58]But now we're silky smooth.
[19:18.56]We should be.
[19:23.68]Okay.
[19:27.54]I left.
[19:27.88]Alright, hold on.
[19:28.42]I gotta do this, too.
[19:29.22]Like, I'm sorry, guys, but, like, this is... My computer sucks.
[19:33.34]It really shouldn't suck this much.
[19:35.94]Do I have to take tech... Alright, I gotta take this down to two.
[19:41.12]I just got this computer.
[19:42.38]I got a 1080 in here.
[19:43.82]That's not good anymore, is it?
[19:46.16]Shit, that's not good anymore.
[19:47.52]That's, like, not good at all anymore.
[19:52.39]I have a 4770K.
[19:54.13]That's good, right?
[19:55.13]No, I don't.
[19:55.49]What do I have?
[19:56.09]Somebody do hashed... Somebody turn on exclamation point... Whatever the... Hold on.
[20:02.68]The 60... I know what it is.
[20:05.04]Quiet!
[20:05.96]I work in insurance.
[20:08.18]Right.
[20:09.72]Undercover, are we?
[20:11.53]No, no, I'm just not who you think I am, sir.
[20:15.25]Now, please leave me alone or I'll be forced to alert security.
[20:18.71]Oh, I'm sorry.
[20:20.83]Why is this stuttering so much?
[20:25.14]Have a good day.
[20:25.68]Okay.
[20:27.74]Hold on a minute here.
[20:28.24]Ruby Red, famous mug-breaking investigative journalist, is in the bank.
[20:33.14]She's up to something.
[20:34.46]Okay.
[20:34.62]Let's see where she goes.
[20:35.94]Investigate Ruby Red.
[20:36.92]Alright, why is that happening now?
[20:38.58]This game fucking hates my computer.
[20:39.94]Somebody called it, too.
[21:01.34]Don't you dare dump this story, Ted.
[21:03.21]I will find that... Oh, she's listening.
[21:07.50]I'm sorry.
[21:08.30]I'm not interrupting your phone call.
[21:09.72]I'm testing my stream settings.
[21:21.89]I look like such a fucking idiot right now.
[21:23.72]I'm doing V-sync, that's right.
[21:24.68]Okay.
[21:24.86]Stocks are gonna plummet.
[21:25.62]They actually fixed everything.
[21:51.36]I'm so out of place.
[21:57.31]Alright, email the documents.
[21:58.83]I gotta investigate the whistleblower.
[22:00.17]Wait, was that the person she was on the phone with?
[22:05.81]Why were you talking on the phone?
[22:11.26]Oh, I can't get in there.
[22:12.26]Alright, hold on.
[22:13.06]I gotta get a soup.
[22:13.68]Alright, let me, um...
[22:20.27]Alright, you got a good cop, bad cop routine going.
[22:22.22]Appreciate it.
[22:23.44]Wait, I don't want to get on camera.
[22:24.32]Alright, let me see the map.
[22:34.03]We got a bathroom?
[22:36.05]Lost and found.
[22:37.11]Alright, let me... I don't know what to do with the bathroom.
[22:40.49]I don't know what to do.
[22:42.75]I can't be a guy in... I got the corner of my foot touched that.
[22:49.61]Do I know you?
[22:51.18]I don't know you.
[22:52.54]What?
[22:53.24]Oh, because I picked this up.
[22:55.20]How do I put it down?
[23:00.26]I didn't do that.
[23:01.52]I had nothing to do with that.
[23:05.19]Look, it's obviously a wet floor.
[23:09.65]I didn't kill anybody.
[23:11.47]How do I put this down?
[23:12.43]You sort of like...
[23:19.18]Hold on.
[23:19.54]Wait.
[23:19.78]I can go over here now.
[23:21.89]This is the security check.
[23:22.99]I just got it.

[26:06.73]Okay.
[26:08.25]So, alright.
[26:09.37]That's a different hitman.
[26:10.21]Alright, I need to go investigate.
[26:11.43]I need different clothes.
[26:19.71]How long does it take for a janitor to come in here?
[26:22.29]You?
[26:23.43]Thank you.
[26:24.03]No.
[26:24.49]It's I, too.
[26:25.13]Alright.
[26:26.69]Just investigating distraction.
[26:30.20]Who is it?
[26:52.34]God, how fucking stupid this game is.
[26:54.92]Okay.
[26:55.62]I need to investigate the whistleblower.
[27:04.31]I need somebody's outfit.
[27:05.55]Can I put my back against the wall and do, like, the knock-knock solid snake thing?
[27:09.44]Alright, hold on.
[27:10.70]Wait, I got an idea.
[27:11.88]Somebody just get the fuck in here.

[27:54.84]We're gonna raid?
[27:58.32]Tyler McVicker!
[28:00.90]Thanks for the raid.
[28:02.04]Welcome, guys.
[28:03.32]Playing Hitman.
[28:04.71]DLC.
[28:05.29]I'm trying to really learn how to play the game, because I don't know how to play it.
[28:09.05]I do this thing where I... Don't ever put me on a bicycle, because you know, like, oh, once you learn how to ride a bike, you'll know how to do it forever.
[28:14.29]No, I won't.
[28:15.31]If I got on a bike right now... I learned how to ride a bike when I was, like, ten.
[28:18.45]If I got on a bike right now, I would fall over.
[28:27.45]Alright, so I'm good.
[28:28.19]I'm the janitor.
[28:28.71]So now I have to... What?
[28:31.65]What's going on?
[28:33.42]Why is it illegal for the janitor to be up here?
[28:35.02]Oh.
[28:38.24]Have we talked to everyone?
[28:48.29]No.
[28:49.81]God damn it.
[28:50.79]What's wrong with this guy?
[28:52.39]Why does he hate me so much?
[28:53.43]Alright.
[28:53.71]Wait, there's something else going on.
[28:55.67]What's this story?
[28:56.09]Oh, gross.
[28:56.39]Oh, wait.
[28:56.76]Hold on.
[28:57.10]So, the job interview.
[28:57.62]Final applicant was seen going to the bathroom.
[28:59.30]Yeah.
[28:59.60]Okay.
[28:59.78]Where is it?
[29:20.25]I want to do that instead.
[29:22.92]Wait.
[29:29.12]Can I blend in with a mop?
[29:30.18]What's this thing?
[29:33.73]There's earphones on this desk.
[29:36.17]Save.
[29:36.67]Save it.
[29:37.11]Save it right here.
[29:39.63]Manual save.
[29:50.93]I'm sorry, I just want the earphones.
[29:54.08]I got him.
[30:00.74]Free earphones.
[30:01.66]Alright, let's go back to the guy that's thrown up here.
[30:12.31]Where is this?
[30:16.47]Wait, was he in here?
[30:17.95]He was in here?
[30:20.35]Oh, I have to... The door is locked.
[30:22.09]Oh, I get it.
[30:22.55]Okay.
[30:24.23]How do I knock on the door?
[30:40.75]Is he going to come out?
[30:42.31]I've got to be ready for him when he comes out.
[30:47.18]When he comes out, should I...
[30:49.68]Is this the exit?
[30:50.32]How do I get in there?
[30:59.91]Oh, this is still flooding.
[31:01.21]Is there a way to... Wait.
[31:06.57]Uh... I need to get in this bathroom.
[31:14.60]This is bad.
[31:15.30]I don't want to do that.
[31:20.40]I'm fucking ruining this bathroom.
[31:24.32]Is anybody in there?
[31:27.90]Knock knock!
[31:33.73]I need to unlock this door.
[31:35.55]Doesn't the janitor have every single key?
[31:39.69]I thought that was a thing.
[31:44.45]Shoot him through the door and then I would never get in.
[31:47.11]No.
[31:48.89]I need a key, like a security... I need a security key.
[32:01.92]I'm kind of just collecting stuff.
[32:03.10]Alright, wait, hold on.
[32:03.64]Soda can.
[32:04.88]Nice, okay.
[32:09.00]This is not Skyrim.
[32:10.22]I don't know why I'm picking up all this useless shit.
[32:12.12]Can I take this guy's coffee when he puts it down?
[32:20.11]I'm waiting.
[32:20.55]Alright, I need that guy right there.
[32:24.01]I need a new outfit.
[32:25.61]I have to get in that room!
[32:27.95]Can I open the door with the crowbar?
[32:31.77]I'll try it.
[32:32.19]Oh!
[32:41.12]Oh god.
[32:57.77]Don't you dare.
[33:01.81]I have too much to... I got a disguise as the applicant.
[33:05.11]Does he have a keycard?
[33:08.09]I'm gonna get a... Is there enough room in here?
[33:17.35]Put his face in the toilet.
[33:18.47]You guys are fucked up.
[33:30.58]Look at the toilet.
[33:32.34]Uh, uh, uh, TOS.
[33:32.92]Shit, I'm just gonna turn this off.
[33:37.08]I don't need it anymore.
[33:46.37]I now approach the reception.
[33:48.81]I'm the applicant for the work, for the job.
[33:52.70]That's the target up there.
[33:57.54]I'm late to the interview!
[33:58.54]There you are.
[34:02.04]Feeling better, I hope.
[34:03.64]Should I let HR know you're ready for the final interview?
[34:06.53]Yes.
[34:07.97]I feel like a new man.
[34:10.01]I'm ready.
[34:10.57]Wonderful.
[34:11.31]Follow me, please.
[34:12.49]It's right down here.
[34:18.11]I thought that was her.
[34:20.35]Alright, follow you.
[34:27.94]I hate when they do this shit in MMOs.
[34:30.30]I don't want to walk faster than the NPC, I want to walk with the NPC.
[34:35.62]Like, why is there no match speed?
[34:37.22]This is the interview.
[34:41.77]Uh...
[34:48.92]I bring my lucky wrench to interviews, apparently.
[34:51.24]Okay.
[34:51.94]Let's sit down.
[34:52.48]Cool.
[34:53.36]I'm sorry.
[34:54.14]I'm sorry.

[35:19.04]Did I get the job?
[35:20.10]Did I get the job?
[35:23.19]Oh shit, okay.

[36:17.52]Ugh.
[36:19.56]These games are fucking so funny.
[36:21.04]Alright.
[36:30.43]I'm going to get stuck here, I think.
[36:32.07]I don't want to get seen by the camera.
[36:35.11]God damn it.
[36:35.73]I got seen.
[36:52.42]Press Alt.
[36:54.07]Why?
[36:56.00]Alt?
[37:00.22]Okay, I'm ready for the interview.
[37:03.05]Oh.
[37:03.11]Personality test.
[37:04.21]I'm ready.
[37:29.90]It's clearly me.
[37:30.26]With two guns.
[37:30.63]Why would they be doing this?
[37:31.97]Did you see my resume?
[37:32.45]I went to Brown University, goddammit.
[37:33.25]Opportunity.
[37:33.55]Now here's the fucking 500 IQ play.
[37:35.21]Hmm.
[37:36.11]You know?
[37:36.37]The Forbes magazine over there.
[37:58.44]They're going to be like, wait a minute, that wasn't part of the plan.
[38:01.87]What?
[38:02.29]Oh, I understand.
[38:04.93]He went completely out of the box.
[38:07.46]Opportunity.
[38:10.64]um I don't know this one no this one this one alright now look at it closely take a few moments then tell me do you see an animal or an object it's clearly a bird I see what kind of animal an eagle bird an eagle perhaps an eagle very interesting a forceful animal anything else it's feeding on something feeding on what a carcass
[38:40.10]The scene is reflected in a pool of blood flowing from the body.
[38:44.20]Okay, uh... It's a vulture feeding on someone else's kill.
[38:48.47]This is for a bank cart job?
[38:50.43]Mr. Thomas.
[38:51.37]Yes.
[38:52.37]Brutal, even.
[38:53.49]Right.
[38:55.27]Very interesting observation, Mr. Thomas.
[38:58.33]Not what we expected, but that's perfectly fine.
[39:02.19]Let's take the next one, shall we?
[39:03.63]The next one.
[39:04.09]Pick any of the remaining cards that make you think of execution, please.
[39:09.78]I mean, it obviously is going to be the one with the... It's Hitman 47 with his two pistols.
[39:16.23]But this could also be one.
[39:19.95]I'm not going to go for the easy one.
[39:25.19]What do you see here?
[39:26.95]Take in the whole image, please.
[39:28.75]And in as much detail as possible, tell me what this reminds you of.
[39:35.34]Can you elaborate on that?
[39:36.92]I see a big pile of money earned performing questionable actions.
[39:42.60]And how do you feel about that?
[39:44.16]I'm trying to just completely bomb this interview.
[39:46.78]Uh-huh.
[40:05.71]So my experience in the banking world, I was a teller at Bank of America for four years.
[40:11.82]I've handled money for a lot.
[40:13.62]Why?
[40:14.57]You don't care about that.
[40:16.45]Whenever you're ready, just grab a card.
[40:18.65]Okay, sure.
[40:19.31]I'll pick the card.
[40:21.55]I'll pick this one.
[40:22.59]Good choice.
[40:24.29]Tell me, what is the first thing you see?
[40:26.39]I've also been... I've handled gold before and... I see a figure in a large coat.
[40:32.05]Perspective skewed as if I'm looking at him from the ground.
[40:36.93]He's got something in his hands.
[40:38.75]I...
[40:40.75]Go on.
[40:41.37]He's armed.
[40:42.33]Dual firearms.
[40:43.87]Large caliber pistols.
[40:45.53]I see.
[40:46.55]What else do you see?
[40:47.63]He's just finished a job.
[40:49.44]Perfectly executed.
[40:51.08]And who is this man?
[40:52.88]It's me.
[40:53.54]Very, very interesting, Mr. Thomas.
[40:56.96]Well, that was certainly unexpected.
[41:00.83]Did I get it?
[41:01.27]What?
[41:01.55]This is when they lean in and wink.
[41:02.79]Accounting department.
[41:03.27]I want you to wink, wink.
[41:04.11]I want you to beat the shit out of people I don't like.
[41:30.00]Great point, Melissa.
[41:31.52]There's no need to turn this little setback into a complete failure.
[41:35.29]Someone with your particular set of skills would be perfect.
[41:38.27]I'll take it.
[41:38.99]When do I start?
[41:40.61]Well, aren't you an eager beaver?
[41:42.77]Well, we expect you to come in tomorrow at 8.
[41:44.83]Welcome on board, Mr. Thomas.
[41:50.42]Oh, I did it all correct.
[41:52.88]I didn't even mean to.
[42:02.06]I did it.
[42:02.44]Now what?
[42:02.76]They're both just leaving their office?
[42:06.08]Okay, bye.
[42:11.57]Time to rifle through your desk.
[42:13.07]Okay, cool.
[42:14.79]What was this shit?
[42:16.59]Turn the lights off, too.
[42:17.31]Let's make it atmospheric.
[42:18.23]No, close.
[42:20.21]Okay, quickly.
[42:20.83]What have I got?
[42:21.27]Coffee.
[42:21.61]We got something in your desk.
[42:24.02]Your computer.
[42:25.28]Hack his computer.
[42:26.38]Take his pen.
[42:27.22]What should I do here?
[42:28.60]What should I do?
[42:31.12]Uh, it's a bust of his head, I think.
[42:33.22]Okay.
[42:34.98]Nothing else.
[42:40.95]Wait, I got the job.
[42:41.69]What are you talking about?
[42:42.29]I got the job.
[42:44.63]Restart.
[42:45.67]What?
[42:45.89]I got the... Didn't I get the job?
[42:48.41]They gave me the job.
[42:49.21]Wrong job.
[42:56.35]That's a win, man.
[43:11.81]It was me.
[43:13.67]It was me.
[43:18.47]You, armed man, please help.
[43:21.24]Please, you need to leave now.
[43:23.08]Wait, hold on.
[43:23.84]Are they... I thought they were going after... I'm telling you, don't push me.
[43:30.53]Fire at will.
[43:31.51]Take him down.
[43:32.57]Take... Crazy son of a bitch...
[43:42.16]I'm trying to get him to shoot him.
[43:43.74]Alright, so I did it wrong?
[43:48.93]That's too... I saved over it.
[43:53.11]No, okay, right here.
[43:55.02]There's an auto-save that saved me.
[44:06.79]Okay.
[44:07.61]No.
[44:07.71]Wait.
[44:07.95]I can't.
[44:08.19]I screwed it up, guys.
[44:09.15]I saved over.
[44:09.63]I thought I got the job.
[44:11.61]I thought I got a job.
[44:12.33]I thought I got a job.
[44:34.31]I didn't get THE job.
[44:35.83]I got A job.
[44:39.07]Go further back?
[44:41.43]But then I- I look at how far back this is.
[44:45.56]Now I'm gonna get distracted.
[44:46.60]Alright, I'll try.
[44:51.68]I'll try.
[44:52.14]I'm gonna try it.
[44:53.08]I'm gonna go very- I'm gonna go very, very fast.
[45:02.78]Oh, God.
[45:03.24]I need another... Okay, I need the bathroom.
[45:05.88]I need crowbar.
[45:06.66]I need bathroom.
[45:09.90]I don't even... I don't remember how I got in there.
[45:14.42]I gotta watch out, though.
[45:18.80]Alright.
[45:19.60]Let's go down here.
[45:24.25]Make the guy fall again.
[45:25.49]I can't just relive the whole thing.
[45:29.59]What is this?
[45:37.24]No.
[45:38.98]I'm too stressed.
[45:39.80]I'm not stressed.
[45:40.86]What are you talking about?
[45:42.78]These guys have guns.
[46:02.92]I'm getting inside my own... Where's the bathroom here?
[46:04.82]Alright, this guy right here.
[46:08.40]Bathroom.
[46:12.30]You're not allowed to go in there, right?
[46:21.55]You're allowed to go... Is this like... Is this like public space?
[46:29.43]No.
[46:30.81]Okay.
[46:30.95]Okay.
[46:34.85]What?
[46:35.55]It's a zoo?
[46:36.95]Alright, this way.
[46:37.89]I need to find the correct- There we go.
[46:39.41]Wet floor sign.
[46:40.19]This is the part I remember.
[46:45.91]Is it gonna happen?
[46:46.47]Here it comes.
[46:51.92]She absorbed all the water.
[46:55.98]She absorbed the water.
[47:07.66]She's just soaking.
[47:11.09]Not why they're looking for me.
[47:12.59]I told you this wasn't going to work.
[47:22.95]Create a water leak.
[47:26.86]Alright, what about over here?
[47:33.72]There's the janitor.
[47:36.08]Money out of the ATM?
[47:40.87]Hold on, is this like free money?
[47:44.39]Why is it a slot machine?
[47:45.51]That guy just said yes.
[48:10.28]It is a slot machine.
[48:10.96]Okay, here we go.
[48:11.44]Shit.
[48:11.56]Get out of here.
[48:20.20]Come on.
[48:21.70]I need this guy's costume.
[48:22.88]You sink?
[48:23.10]No, no, you.
[48:23.70]I'm just... I peek out.
[48:24.50]That was me.
[48:55.60]No, no, no, no, no.
[48:57.48]Who are these?
[49:01.10]Alright.
[49:22.23]Janitor Key?
[49:24.36]Holy shit, I got the Janitor Key.
[49:26.92]Alright, I'm good.
[49:32.26]That guy left.
[49:33.70]Have a great day.
[49:42.79]Okay, I need to save the game here.
[49:53.12]Not... Didn't wash hands?
[49:56.05]Okay, so now... I'm going up here.
[49:58.67]That guy can see.
[50:05.15]Can I walk into this?
[50:09.43]I have the janitor key.
[50:10.29]This is fine.
[50:12.11]No, it's not.
[50:12.87]I'm not allowed in there.
[50:17.80]I'm a security guard.
[50:19.52]Why would I not be allowed over there?
[50:20.70]Alright, hold on.
[50:21.08]There's like a wardrobe this way.
[50:38.26]I'm going a completely different way than I went last time.
[50:40.06]Alright, hold on.
[50:41.72]What is that?
[50:45.52]I want that.
[50:45.96]Whatever it is, give it to me.
[50:47.54]Propane flask.
[50:51.34]I don't want this, actually.
[50:55.31]No, I have to put this down.
[51:02.23]I just showed it to him.
[51:04.25]I just showed it to him.
[51:05.41]Alright, I have to reload.
[51:06.89]Is that it?
[51:07.81]That activates it?
[51:08.63]Wait, what?
[51:42.94]I forgot how much fun this game was.
[51:49.56]Alright.
[51:51.00]Let's go.
[51:51.46]I gotta go this way.
[51:54.10]Up the stairs.
[51:55.94]Just avoid the random police officers that are gonna be staring at me.
[52:01.63]Just run by.
[52:04.23]Made it.
[52:05.19]Kind of.
[52:07.85]What's with this cube?
[52:09.69]Hold on, what's the cube?
[52:10.77]I need to know what's in the cube.
[52:16.08]What?
[52:16.48]Okay.
[52:19.36]Alright, I'm not going to fail the interview this time.
[52:21.32]Wait, this is something new.
[52:33.17]Wait, this is the whistleblower.
[52:34.34]Well, I hit a bit of an obstacle here.
[52:44.23]What?
[52:44.67]Okay, fine.
[52:45.27]Fine!
[53:06.58]Alright.
[53:07.04]Hit the file in a safety deposit box in the basement.
[53:09.62]Keys are on the desk.
[53:36.88]Yeah, let me save it here.
[53:38.28]Locate the deposit box key.
[53:39.83]Alright.
[53:40.25]But where is that?
[53:41.23]That way.
[53:41.53]Alright.
[53:41.85]Can I scan my ass?
[54:09.94]I'm sorry.
[54:10.34]Don't mind me.
[54:17.71]Do you have anything on you?
[54:38.39]Nothing?
[54:40.46]Ooh, apple.

[55:08.44]This guy right here?
[55:08.90]This person right here.
[55:10.12]That's the only person that's here.
[55:39.86]Oh shit!
[56:20.00]Somebody has to come help.
[56:25.70]I have to make my escape.
[56:26.58]I have to... My fingerprints are all over that, right?
[56:29.38]Yeah, look at... I don't even wear gloves.

[56:37.79]Let's go.
[56:39.67]Can I get the knife?
[56:42.44]Oh, that's disgusting.
[56:43.72]Okay.
[56:43.98]Give me the apple.
[56:45.73]I was never here.
[56:47.33]Wait, can I address this person?
[56:49.31]Nope.
[56:49.81]Okay, hold on.
[56:50.51]I got the safety deposit box key.
[56:52.11]I gotta go up here.
[56:53.73]I'm freaking out.
[56:54.37]Okay, save the game.
[56:56.57]In a different spot.
[56:59.85]Okay.
[57:08.92]Wait, I have bloody footprints?
[57:10.80]No, I don't.
[57:14.39]Who is looking at me?
[57:25.22]What is this?
[57:27.00]Turn on frosted glass?
[57:30.72]Oh, nice.
[57:31.20]This is a little safe area.
[57:35.58]Alright, I gotta keep that.
[57:36.34]I gotta remind myself to come in here.
[57:39.50]So, I gotta get in there and get the key.
[57:49.13]I'm allowed in here.
[57:50.35]There's only one person at the desk over there.
[57:52.13]I can get it.
[57:52.51]Shit!
[58:01.10]Is anybody else in here?
[58:01.64]Yes, please hold on.
[58:11.21]I'll pass you through.
[58:20.87]No, don't poison the water bottle.
[58:22.24]What am I doing?
[58:24.22]Okay, the key is... Where is it?
[58:29.66]Muffin.
[58:35.46]Alright, looking for the desk.
[58:36.46]Looking for the key.
[58:37.88]Wait, is it in there?
[58:38.98]It's not one of these desks.
[58:54.29]Got it.
[59:08.60]Holding ear pods.
[59:11.18]I'm going to save it here.
[59:12.90]Now, a new one.
[59:17.58]Wow.
[59:18.68]I can tell you... Stop that.
[59:21.80]You should...

[59:30.95]Alright, time to go to the... I gotta go down to the basement.
[59:35.87]How am I gonna get down to the basement?
[59:41.20]I have to go all the way down here, I think.

[59:47.58]No one's found this yet.
[59:48.70]That's good.
[59:50.53]I gotta get down here.
[59:51.35]These guys will let me through, right?
[59:56.90]Alright.

[60:18.02]Any money in here?
[60:50.74]Oh shit, there is money!
[60:54.72]There's a money key!
[60:55.52]Alright, I got the money key.
[61:08.39]Nah, I have to fuck with this guy for a minute.
[61:33.03]He was going to call something in, but he just got embarrassed.
[61:35.58]I think he thought he fell off the chair.
[61:37.02]Hey, this is... Oh, wait a minute.
[61:38.08]I was just sleeping.
[61:40.08]Never mind.
[61:41.48]Everything's fine.
[61:53.57]Right before he dozes off.
[61:56.06]Alright, he's just dozed off.
[61:57.10]There it is.
[62:05.31]You know when you're right about to fall asleep... ...and you get ripped out of it?
[62:12.05]He's gonna go back to bed in front of these guys?

[63:04.56]It's data.
[63:05.18]Ah, there we go.
[63:06.78]Now he wants to investigate.
[63:08.46]What did he just take?
[63:28.49]Ready?
[63:28.89]One, two, three.
[63:32.10]Okay.
[63:36.10]This is where we end it.
[63:36.82]This is going to be so horrible.
[63:37.68]Right when he goes to bed.
[63:58.24]He's up.
[64:28.07]Will he remember this?
[64:28.93]I'm trying to sit him back in the chair.
[64:40.52]This is not even that bad.
[64:41.48]Everybody knows this guy sleeps on the job anyways.
[64:44.40]Alright, I need to pick up all the things I threw.
[64:46.09]Okay, that's everything I had, right?
[64:56.03]Unconscious witness.
[64:58.36]What do you mean, unconscious witness?
[65:01.04]Wait, he saw my face.
[65:09.89]I can't, like, dump rat poison down his throat?
[65:13.04]Alright, that's fucked up.
[65:14.16]I just said that out loud.
[65:15.52]Alright, he'll be fine.
[65:27.85]I was trying to, like, plant the earpods on him.
[65:29.45]Alright, whatever, he'll be out for a while.
[65:34.44]I gotta go to Ruby Red.
[65:48.44]How has nobody found you yet?
[65:54.31]Reload.
[65:55.23]Oh, that's right.
[65:55.67]I did.
[65:55.89]I saved it right before I did all that.
[65:58.49]You're right.
[66:05.01]The blood has been cleaned up.
[66:06.32]Alright, let's go.
[66:18.36]Should I be actually working with Ruby Red?
[66:21.24]I'm going to get double-crossed here.
[66:22.26]That's what happens in these games.
[66:24.12]Now the blood is there this time.
[66:25.32]Alright, I got files.
[66:29.60]What's in it for me?
[66:34.71]How are you?
[66:36.51]Is that what I think it is?
[66:39.47]It is.
[66:41.37]Yes.
[66:42.49]Just make sure the information will be put to good use.
[66:45.93]Oh, you can bank on that.
[66:48.50]Who are you?
[66:50.05]What's your role in this?
[66:51.53]I'm not important.
[66:52.83]Good luck.
[66:53.45]It sounds like Miss Red has quite a scoop on her hands.
[66:56.53]Yeah.
[66:57.21]My guess is this will cause a major market upset.
[67:00.15]No, no, no.
[67:01.39]No photos of me.

[74:33.73]What is it?
[74:34.11]Intel.
[74:35.73]Notice from the bank's head of security mentions that recent issues with the building's wireless internet have gotten Director Salvala so high strung that fixing the Wi-Fi in her office always takes priority.
[74:46.74]If the Wi-Fi in the director's office breaks down, IT is allowed full and immediate access to the area.
[74:53.48]No questions asked.

[75:31.06]Holy shit, the guy... Wait a minute.
[75:32.00]The guy's doing coke.
[75:34.48]Wait, what?
[75:40.34]Hold on a second.
[75:50.27]I want him to wake up and then do coke naked and die.
[75:54.19]Okay.
[76:04.22]How do you wake somebody up?
[76:08.46]If I make a loud noise, will he get up?
[76:12.16]Can I give his clothes back?
[76:28.57]The guards wake him up.
[76:29.89]Okay.
[76:36.85]Reload and poison Coke.
[76:40.61]How am I going to do that?
[76:42.13]He's just going to be staring at me.
[76:45.78]Hold on.
[76:48.76]Just dump poison on it while he smokes.
[76:57.18]Okay, it's this way.
[76:58.88]He comes into this bathroom.
[77:01.36]Is it just here?
[77:03.66]Who just has Coke just sitting here?
[77:05.20]What?
[77:19.53]This is just community coke.
[77:22.12]I'm sorry.
[77:22.84]It's all yours.
[77:23.32]Oh my god.
[77:44.37]I was behind the door!
[77:45.17]How would you see that?
[77:46.73]Alright, I gotta go faster.
[78:18.35]Okay, then I'm gonna go in behind him.
[78:22.27]Wait, can I hide in this?
[78:39.44]Yes.
[78:39.64]God damn it!
[78:44.26]I just wanna watch you do coke and die!
[78:57.04]What happened?
[78:59.14]He didn't do anything.
[79:06.28]Is he just sick because he's sick?
[79:41.52]He's ready to fight!
[79:42.37]Jesus H. Christ.
[79:50.89]Hey, what command?
[79:52.59]Please acknowledge.
[79:53.37]Come in, come in.
[79:54.94]Some are making trouble.
[79:57.88]Possibly high on drugs.
[80:00.22]Come here!
[80:01.08]Come here!
[80:04.11]Wait, that guy was the problem?
[80:07.30]I thought it was me.
[80:08.94]That guy was the problem, not me.
[80:25.67]Oh, that's so funny.
[80:27.77]I'm sitting here so concerned that they're chasing me.
[80:30.81]Okay, I'm only doing this one more time, and then I have to do something else.
[80:48.07]Can you do the coke?
[80:49.09]No.
[80:53.09]You gotta get him sick, and then high, and then him running around outside.
[80:57.15]Right, okay.
[80:58.72]I'll go for it.
[81:20.81]I don't feel so good.
[81:22.39]Where are the bathrooms?
[81:31.67]He doesn't know where the bathroom is.
[81:40.39]Why would you puke in there?
[81:45.75]Wait, wait, wait.
[81:46.35]Hold on a second.
[81:47.03]Give me that wristwatch.
[81:50.92]Don't mind me.
[81:51.56]I'm just going to turn on the water.
[81:53.12]Help you out a little bit.
[81:58.82]Wait, hold on.
[81:59.53]He's not going to slip in that, is he?
[82:15.34]I'm just making it worse.
[82:16.22]Alright, here.
[82:16.58]Now...
[82:19.57]broke his watch give me the watch back I have to bring people over here
[82:51.89]What is he doing?
[82:52.43]Is he wiping?
[82:54.56]Is he washing his hands in the water on the ground?
[82:58.43]This guy is fucking high.
[83:37.83]Look at this guy.
[83:38.97]He's doing something wrong.

[97:40.70]Clothes.
[97:43.08]Iron.
[97:44.76]Ah!
[97:58.39]It's like a net gear.
[98:05.45]Does she just come and try to unplug it and plug it back in?
[98:09.17]No, she's going to figure it out.
[98:16.74]What does she do, though?
[98:18.00]She demands an IT person.
[98:21.24]There you go.
[98:30.89]Somebody get IT up.
[98:34.93]Yeah!
[98:37.29]Alright.
[98:38.71]Where's the IT guy?

[98:53.00]We need Tim, the IT guy.
[99:03.33]Alright.
[99:04.19]I gotta get the hell out of here.
[99:06.59]Tim, the IT guy.
[99:14.94]Gotta go down.
[99:15.50]Have you tried turning it on and turning it off again?
[99:26.79]She's asked for her assistant to get someone from IT to come up and look at it.
[99:29.45]This would be an excellent way to get close to the director.
[99:31.27]Alright.
[99:32.29]I have to get down to IT and get a costume.
[99:37.89]Where am I now?
[99:38.53]Down.
[99:39.05]I gotta go down from here.
[99:50.74]Is he already up there?
[99:53.58]I got a computer up there.
[100:12.00]So which way does he have to go?
[100:13.58]No, that's not a guy on a computer.
[100:14.60]Is he gonna come up these stairs?
[100:19.85]He has to come up these stairs.
[100:38.58]Alright, so where is he?
[100:40.30]Fix the router, let's go!
[100:52.87]It's going to take a while to get up here.
[101:07.96]Are you guys sure somebody's going to come up into this room?
[101:12.55]I think they were on the way up and I think they just found the body.
[101:15.99]That's the IT guy that's on the way up.
[101:19.01]Ha ha ha!
[101:26.96]I have to get back down there.
[101:30.34]Oh no, the IT guy found him.
[101:32.52]That's great.
[101:33.58]Oh my god.
[101:40.59]Why is the IT guy?
[101:41.57]It's always the IT department.
[101:42.83]They just do everything.
[101:44.61]They figure everything out.
[101:46.27]They don't get enough credit.
[101:57.00]I wonder how long I have to sit here for, though.
[102:03.86]At what point does unplugging and plugging back in the router take precedence over dead guy with knife in head on the stairs?
[102:11.52]I don't know.
[102:20.19]We're gonna find out.
[102:22.47]Still searching.
[102:27.65]What is that down there?
[102:28.57]I have to go meet him down there.
[102:44.85]I do.
[102:45.83]Where did I save it last?
[102:49.60]I think I have to just run down to where that guy's dead and intercept him and leave two dead bodies there.
[102:57.13]You know what I'm saying?
[102:59.19]That's the play.
[103:12.78]Okay.
[103:14.00]I've gotta get down to where that is.
[103:16.67]I gotta get down there quick.
[103:37.13]Where is it?
[103:37.65]Where is it?
[103:38.05]Oh, shit.
[103:38.83]Where is it?
[103:39.17]Is that?
[103:41.95]Get out of my way.
[103:42.95]Fuck!
[103:49.08]God damn it.
[103:49.76]It's that guy.
[103:58.05]No, I can't.
[103:58.59]You gotta get ready.
[103:59.81]What a fucking idiot.
[104:04.11]Where is he?
[104:08.26]Alright, out into the right.
[104:12.58]Down the stairs, go.
[104:14.54]Go!
[104:22.52]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[104:23.50]Where is it, where is it, where is it, where is it?

[104:36.15]IT guy, where is he?
[104:43.01]That's him, I think, right there.
[104:58.71]Who?
[104:58.98]What?
[105:03.80]What?
[105:05.44]Who found it?
[105:07.76]Oh, fuck.
[105:08.06]There he is.
[105:08.50]I gotta save right now.
[105:11.91]Over here.

[117:29.21]What's the drop button?
[117:30.05]How do you drop?
[117:30.43]How do you drop?
[117:30.81]How do you drop?
[117:31.43]How do I drop?
[117:31.87]G?
[117:32.57]How do I drop?
[117:33.29]F?
[117:33.81]How do you drop something?
[117:43.21]What other fucked up shit do I have in here?
[117:44.67]Illegal.
[117:52.31]Okay, I'm good.
[117:53.51]I'm doing well, thank you.
[118:27.43]What?
[119:02.68]What are you talking about?
[119:24.49]Okay.
[119:25.53]I think I did it.
[119:26.47]No, they're gonna see me do this!
[119:28.83]Alright.
[119:29.39]Save.
[119:29.99]Throw apple.
[119:31.27]Ugh.
[119:36.85]Okay, throw apple through doors.
[119:40.83]I could... You know what?
[119:41.45]I could do... I got three apples.
[119:45.58]Check it out.
[119:46.12]Let's see if I can get this done.
[119:48.82]I got you in my sights!
[119:50.28]Oh, no, you... Distracted him!
[119:52.67]Take him down!
[119:53.71]Take him down!
[119:55.15]That's a suspect.
[119:56.49]He's in disguise!
[119:57.33]Jesus!
[120:08.60]Throw the apple up.
[120:11.22]I wonder if I can do this without anybody caring.
[120:19.11]Wait, what?
[120:22.03]Oh, it's right here.
[120:27.31]As long as I don't do anything... I mean, that is weird to take somebody's clothes out of a body bag.
[120:32.44]That's weird.
[120:34.04]But how weird is it?
[120:34.96]Is it weird enough for me to get seen?
[120:38.54]Yes, it is apparently.
[120:44.60]What the fuck am I gonna do about this?
[120:52.73]I'm gonna have to throw a coin down the hall somehow.
[121:34.94]What's going on in here?
[121:37.10]Unlock.
[121:40.46]No, they're gonna take that body out if I'm not... I gotta... Let's see.
[121:52.09]No, go look for it!
[122:12.09]Oh, you motherfucker!
[122:13.25]You motherfucker!
[122:13.99]UGH!
[122:56.29]This is fucking way louder.
[122:57.48]You go look too!
[123:05.43]Both of you!
[123:26.15]Okay.
[123:29.09]Hello?
[123:32.59]Okay.
[123:36.70]Command, we might have a situation.
[123:38.58]I'll check the perimeter.
[123:50.24]I got the key, right?
[123:50.96]Speechless.
[123:53.80]I did.
[123:54.24]Why does this always happen to me?
[123:59.14]Let's go.
[123:59.54]No illegal items, right?
[124:08.49]That's fine.
[124:09.71]Who says apples don't come in handy?
[124:10.61]That's right.
[124:11.07]That is exactly what I said.
[124:12.53]That was verbatim what I said.
[124:16.02]Always carry a few apples with you.
[124:29.11]You never know when you're gonna need to throw it against a wall.
[124:32.45]Don't get on camera.
[124:34.95]Alright, whatever.
[124:39.51]Okay.
[124:42.41]Up.
[124:43.52]We gotta go up one more.
[124:52.96]I'm supposed to be here.
[124:55.10]I'm supposed to be here.
[125:02.96]Save it.
[125:04.41]It's time.
[125:04.77]Alright, I heard you had a problem with your computer.
[125:19.54]Let's take a look.
[125:30.61]Alright, I'm gonna put, like, rat poison coke on her computer.
[125:33.11]Alright, I'm in.
[125:36.71]I'm in.
[125:51.93]Move meeting?
[125:54.53]I just... Alright, I moved...
[125:57.03]Scanning through a director's daily calendar, it becomes clear that she has a meeting planned with Fabian Mann and Mateo Perez.
[126:03.02]It's scheduled around end of business, but should be possible to advance it if needed.
[126:06.74]Okay.
[126:24.28]What's this?
[126:25.24]Newspaper?
[126:29.12]Is the meeting gonna be in here?
[126:35.83]Sabotage the clock.
[126:37.23]Yeah.
[126:47.29]Not playing anything.
[126:57.24]Commemorative token?
[126:59.79]Oh, nice.
[127:03.13]What else is in here?
[127:05.53]She's right in there, too.
[127:06.57]Uh, alright.
[127:09.27]Wait.
[127:10.56]Oh, wait a minute.
[127:11.04]There's poison.
[127:11.90]Poison.
[127:14.04]Poisonable shit in here.
[127:33.89]Okay.
[127:36.53]Now?
[127:43.00]When's that meeting?
[127:45.36]I'm gonna go in here.
[127:51.89]Private chambers discovered.
[127:54.69]It's a hostile area?
[128:04.26]Okay, I'm not supposed to be in here.
[128:05.12]Alright, I gotta wait for that meeting to happen.
[128:12.24]I gotta tamper with the clock, too.
[128:16.78]How do I get you guys out of here?
[128:18.66]Come on, there's gotta be something I can throw.
[128:20.73]There we go, perfect.
[128:22.71]Just, like, throw it over here.
[128:31.04]Uh, got some strange noises here.
[128:33.13]Looking a bit over.
[128:35.73]And then you come investigate an apple.
[128:41.27]Go see what that was.
[128:53.00]I don't see nothing.
[128:54.54]Got it.
[128:56.41]Always carry around a few apples.
[129:13.04]Alright, so now I'm gonna fix the internet... And then they're gonna have a meeting and someone's gonna fall out the window.
[129:29.65]I can't... I don't know how to fix the router, apparently.
[129:40.92]I don't know how to fix a router!
[129:51.72]I'm not a real IT guy.
[129:54.15]What the fuck am I supposed to do?
[130:01.85]Can I even do this?
[130:10.35]Wait.
[130:11.19]Hold on.
[130:13.47]Looks like she's coming out.
[130:17.33]No?
[130:20.05]Shoot it.
[130:20.53]No, that'll alert everybody!
[130:22.09]Alright, what else have I got here?
[130:28.41]Okay, I advanced the meeting.
[130:35.39]Is there anything else I can do to advance this?
[130:39.94]Because the internet is not fixable now.
[130:41.74]Oh, there she is.
[130:42.52]Okay.
[130:48.98]Investigating distraction?
[130:51.16]What do you mean, what distraction?
[130:54.59]Oh sh-fucking god!
[130:56.39]What distraction?
[130:58.91]Where is she going?
[131:25.22]Go to the meeting.
[131:30.52]Meeting?
[131:46.51]Hey, you can't be here.
[131:49.35]What?
[131:52.30]Oh, no you don't.
[131:53.32]Drop whatever it is.
[132:14.09]You're on your own.
[132:16.97]Run.
[132:25.52]If your bodyguard or security guard ever says, you're on your own, run.
[132:40.73]Okay.
[132:46.08]Go to the meeting!
[132:46.82]How do I get them to go to the meeting?
[132:57.59]There ain't anything else I have to do.
[132:59.45]I have the gramophone.
[133:01.85]There's no reason because I killed him.
[133:05.95]Oh, I killed the person that she's talking about.
[133:12.39]How did I do that?
[133:18.70]Wait.
[133:19.20]That's me.
[133:26.52]Yeah?
[133:26.64]I don't want to hear any excuses or answer any questions.
[133:31.62]Just fix my computer and get out.
[133:35.22]Alright.
[133:37.79]I already did.
[133:40.53]Everything's good to go.
[133:41.23]Where is that file?
[133:50.81]PA419.
[133:52.69]I was here a minute ago.
[133:58.72]I'm gonna body block her so she can't leap.
[134:31.63]Command, please acknowledge.
[134:33.33]Come in, command.
[134:41.04]Hey, hey, hey, get up.
[134:43.08]You did it.
[134:43.56]Stop.
[134:45.70]I'm gonna take you.
[134:47.60]Somebody fucking help me.
[134:51.20]I got the other key card.
[134:52.98]Somebody's taking people out.
[134:54.44]Come in.
[134:54.86]Don't let him take control of the situation.
[134:59.86]My computer sucks.
[135:01.97]So she has one.
[135:02.69]Who has the other one?
[135:22.96]You know what?
[135:23.88]I think it's time.
[135:28.04]It's time just to make this happen.
[136:04.87]Director Savalas eliminated.
[136:07.15]Good work, 47.
[136:09.91]Second backup data disk is secured.
[136:12.33]Just one to go, 47.
[136:25.13]What is this?
[136:26.75]A credit card?
[136:40.90]Oh, yeah.
[136:41.44]Wow!
[136:44.36]I disabled surveillance systems.
[136:47.50]Can they hear me through the glass?
[137:13.30]What was that What was that explosion?
[137:37.08]I'm firing through the glass somehow.
[137:43.70]Okay.
[137:43.92]I need to get the last data disk, but I have no idea where that is.
[138:10.92]The mirror is shooting at you.
[138:14.52]Okay, can I store this?
[138:15.34]I can.
[138:16.10]Can I take this?
[138:16.68]I can.
[138:18.24]Alright, I'm ready.
[138:20.35]I need one more data disk.
[138:23.97]It's out here.
[138:26.49]Wait, I have to get rid of you.
[138:35.30]Disguised as the agent.
[138:36.60]Oh, yeah.
[138:39.04]High security guard.
[138:47.94]Good to go.
[138:52.44]Blast it.
[138:53.69]That guy can see right through me.
[138:54.79]Alright, let's get out of here.
[139:05.16]Straight out this way.
[139:06.08]Dude, IT guy was way more secure than this.
[139:15.82]Everybody can see through this!
[139:25.33]Go fix the router.
[139:27.01]That's unfixable.
[139:27.89]I broke it.
[139:30.89]Alright.
[139:32.77]Down.
[139:33.17]We have to go into the bank vault.
[139:35.39]Oh my god!
[139:36.97]Everybody can see through this!
[139:39.70]Except for you!
[139:42.08]Shit!
[139:42.38]This is a horrible disguise!
[139:56.62]Okay Down one more level I'm gonna go get all my weapons They should still be over here Save it Down one more time
[140:29.12]So, I should be a high security officer.
[140:31.80]I'm the bodyguard of the objective of the game.
[140:38.84]Don't get restless.
[140:40.82]Nothing to report.
[140:42.58]Yeah, me neither.
[140:43.32]These are perfectly good apples.
[140:47.55]How can you let these go to waste?
[140:54.69]I can unlock this.
[140:58.62]Is there... I think I have the keycard.
[141:01.90]Yep.
[141:02.66]Don't even need it.
[141:03.54]Let's just go into the vault.
[141:05.48]Break open.
[141:06.12]Security lock enabled.
[141:29.31]Alright, I gotta go find the security room.
[141:32.13]I thought the doors were closed.
[141:38.58]Area discovered.
[141:39.32]Wait a minute, hold on.
[141:43.28]Poison.
[141:43.78]I can put poison into the vents?
[141:50.32]Car battery?
[141:59.48]I was trying to shock him.
[142:36.57]I don't like that.
[142:37.17]I'm gonna get less points for that.
[142:39.71]I have to live with it, though.
[142:40.70]I have no save.
[142:41.56]Yes, I do.
[142:50.90]I'm not losing points.
[142:55.18]You already killed four non-targets.
[142:59.80]So?
[143:01.46]I'm an assassin.
[143:02.22]Sometimes you have to do dirty work with the bad guys.
[143:06.14]Turn on the air conditioner.
[143:07.18]Okay.
[143:08.99]What about this?
[143:09.49]Unlock the cabinet.
[143:12.71]What is in here?
[143:13.23]Okay.
[143:19.09]I'm allowed in here.
[143:21.21]Oh, that's nice.
[143:26.67]Yeah, I gave him a tour and everything.
[143:29.11]Afterward, we went to this little diner over on Fifth, and he told me to stay there.
[143:33.12]No, you
[143:42.47]Okay, where's the device?
[143:50.19]Where is it?
[143:51.97]It's not in here?
[143:55.61]You're doing easy mode!
[144:11.08]The more people you kill, the more frames drop.
[144:21.99]So what do I need in here?
[144:23.23]I gotta poison this, but... They're gonna kill them anyways.
[144:26.55]Let's turn this on.
[144:35.30]So this guy comes out here.
[144:41.16]And then what?
[144:43.50]This guy's pissed off.
[144:48.36]We choke him out.
[144:50.12]I take his outfit.
[144:51.92]Because he's... I'm already wearing this disguise.
[144:54.79]Well, that didn't do anything.
[145:04.23]Okay.
[145:07.99]What do you mean, distraction?
[145:25.07]They all just want to turn the AC off?
[145:32.40]That's so stupid.
[145:34.68]I got the keycard.
[145:37.72]They all come out to try to turn the AC off.
[145:46.87]What about you?
[145:47.45]Yep.
[145:50.21]It's hot in here.
[145:51.09]Oh my god.
[145:54.76]I had to let him have a victory here.
[146:22.53]I got what I needed.
[146:24.25]There's nobody else even down here.
[146:31.88]Wait, there's anoth- There's another AC person?
[146:36.29]Oh no, not good.
[146:37.43]Did he get it off?
[147:11.45]Take out his radio.
[147:14.59]I don't think that mattered.
[147:16.45]Missing keycard.
[147:17.53]I picked up like four of them.
[147:25.16]None of those were it?
[147:29.62]Oh, shit.
[147:30.46]Really?
[147:40.81]Alright, well it looks like I'm going over here.
[147:44.63]I wonder if I should go up.
[147:50.74]Where does this lead out?
[147:51.46]I need a keycard to get in there.
[148:00.46]Apparently one I don't have.
[148:01.58]Keep your voice down, man.
[148:10.45]Are we dropping frames?
[148:20.40]Oh, that sucks.
[148:22.76]I wonder why this is happening.
[148:28.50]It's been pretty good for a while.
[148:31.59]But it doesn't matter.
[148:32.93]Cox always sucks.
[148:35.71]Well, I have rat poison, though.
[148:40.19]He's just figuring this out now.
[148:43.31]God damn it, really?
[148:45.63]Alright, I don't want to mess this up.
[148:47.21]Did I drop one of the other cards?
[148:57.53]Come on, stop dropping frames!
[148:59.27]What the fuck?
[149:06.72]What's your deal, Cox?
[149:09.35]What's your deal?
[149:13.55]Do I have to open it with something else?
[149:20.73]There's got to be something in this room, right?
[149:31.33]Got it.
[149:35.11]Bingo.
[149:38.14]Let's go.
[149:39.14]Vault security system has been unlocked.
[149:41.22]Let's do it.
[149:42.44]And then I beat the level.
[149:52.36]Should I push the big red button?
[149:54.82]That's a deal.
[149:55.33]Let's end the vault.
[150:09.95]Trespassing?
[150:11.63]What do you mean trespassing?
[150:13.58]Uh, I'm gonna save it here.
[150:21.13]That's not good.
[150:41.09]They found the bodies.
[150:42.53]Let's go!
[150:42.95]What's with the frames?
[150:43.69]Give me more frames.
[150:44.93]What the hell?
[151:11.26]This is horse shit.
[151:15.24]Oh, I'm so glad this is gonna be over real soon.
[151:20.00]I'm gonna be on fiber in less than two or three months.
[151:23.26]It's gonna be fantastic.
[151:29.15]I got it, the expose.
[151:30.19]A lot of things to do, apparently.
[151:45.79]Did he say fiber?
[151:46.65]No, fiber.
[151:47.50]Like fiber optic internet.
[151:51.92]Fiber to the house.
[151:53.90]So it's not going to be through cable internet.
[151:56.40]Which sucks ass.
[152:00.94]Are we dead?
[152:02.40]Stream dead?
[152:12.16]Are we good?
[152:18.78]Oh, this is bad.
[152:32.31]This just started right now, too.
[152:37.23]It's struggling.
[152:41.85]One star, though.
[152:42.75]What did I get for points? 30,000?
[152:51.50]I wonder if I should change.
[152:58.99]I wonder if I should do this.
[153:01.93]This will probably kill the stream, though.
[153:05.43]No, that's not going to work.
[153:10.83]Let's see if it'll ride itself out.
[153:14.13]Damn, come on.
[153:14.69]I was having fun, too.
[153:16.75]I knew this was going to be a short stream today, but not this short.
[153:23.04]I'm gonna go take a break.
[153:24.01]I'm just gonna pee.
[153:25.65]Come back, see if we can ride it out.
[153:29.47]I will be right back.
[153:32.15]Let's see if this actually stays live.
[153:40.64]We'll find out.
[153:41.20]Be right back.
[156:09.05]How we doing?
[156:14.53]Has it been bad since I left?
[156:16.25]Has it been bad?
[156:26.09]Shit.
[156:28.83]Even the BRB is getting fucked up.
[156:35.16]No, I don't want this.
[156:35.90]I didn't want this to be the last thing I do before TwitchCon.
[156:38.44]Come on.
[156:38.84]I wanted to go for at least like three, four, five hours.
[156:48.40]God damn it.
[156:57.34]Just do a comb stream.
[157:00.54]I really wanted to get these two DLCs done today, though.
[157:04.06]But I obviously don't want to stream it if it's going to be shitty.
[157:13.75]Yeah, I don't want to stream this.
[157:18.71]I did say that I was only going to stream for like three hours or so.
[157:22.33]Three to four today.
[157:23.75]Because I have to get ready to go for TwitchCon.
[157:25.63]But I'm not going to leave yet.
[157:27.29]We'll just hang out for a little bit.
[157:31.47]I'm hoping... No, it's still dropping.
[157:33.93]Damn it.
[157:36.59]You might get a random vlog from TwitchCon.
[157:41.63]Just like an hour long stream.
[157:44.23]I don't know if I'm going to do that though, so don't hold me to that.
[157:47.87]I might not have an opportunity to because I'm not going to be there for very long.
[157:51.33]But... I don't want to continue to do this if it's going to be unwatchable for people.
[157:59.39]Those of you that are just going to take off, I guess you can consider this like the end of the stream.
[158:05.36]I will see you guys later.
[158:06.68]If you're going to TwitchCon, make sure you say hello.
[158:10.14]I'm going to have a toothpick in my mouth.
[158:12.44]Find the guy with the toothpick.
[158:13.41]That's me.
[158:23.35]But for the next hour or so, we're just going to painfully deal with this until I take off.
[158:31.55]So, you'll see me again.
[158:36.11]I'm so salty about this right now.
[158:39.47]God damn it.
[158:45.00]It's going to zero and shit.
[158:48.58]Day before fucking Twitch.
[158:49.76]Whatever.
[158:50.04]It's alright.
[158:50.34]I can't.
[158:50.76]I'm not going to sit here and be pissed off by this.
[158:53.30]I'm going to go like this.
[158:55.93]At least we got to go through one full Hitman mission.
[158:58.61]I would have liked to do both of them.
[159:02.69]But sometimes you can't do what you want, I guess.
[159:07.89]Do you talk to Transformer?
[159:10.07]Uh, we'll see.
[159:11.17]I'll show you guys my... Let's just get out of this.
[159:19.80]But thanks for watching, regardless.
[159:22.62]A nice quick 2 hour and 22 minute stream.
[159:29.44]It's like the old days.
[159:30.42]This reminds me of back when I first started on Twitch.
[159:32.60]I would stream for like 2 to 3 hours.
[159:35.77]Remember when I did that?
[159:36.61]Yeah, just remember.
[159:37.85]Pretend like this dream happened like six years ago.
[159:42.57]Alright, let me move this over here.
[159:48.43]Alright.
[159:50.86]This should switch over to here.
[159:52.80]Okay, we can hang out and do the bits too.
[160:02.72]Just chill.
[160:05.48]Again, if you're going to TwitchCon, please say hello.
[160:11.67]Hopefully we can stay up long enough to do this.
[160:15.89]Ouch.
[160:23.75]Okay.
[160:26.79]Alright.
[160:27.77]Change the category.
[160:40.35]Yeah, I'm even looking at my stream health on my dashboard.
[160:45.30]It's just zero up, zero up, zero up.
[160:49.72]Not healthy stream, apparently.
[160:53.40]I know.
[160:54.46]Twitch, I'm trying.
[160:57.83]Alright, let's head over here.
[161:01.15]Is this going to turn on?
[161:05.35]Let's move.
[161:07.87]I wonder if this is going to work.
[161:12.73]Is this still taking it from yesterday?
[161:16.81]I think this is taking it from yesterday.
[161:20.42]Why is it not working?
[161:26.76]See you later.
[161:27.38]I need to take a stream.
[161:30.50]It's the same people, yeah.
[161:34.46]I'll be back on Tuesday, most likely.
[161:37.78]And I'll probably just end up starting with Hitman 2, just to try to finish that, and then we'll move on to something else.
[161:44.37]Unfortunately, I'm sorry.
[161:45.29]This is not the way that I wanted this to end.
[161:46.75]You gotta do what you gotta do.
[161:53.29]I'm gonna put on the wonderful music.
[162:00.42]I still don't know why this shit is... I gotta figure this out when I come back.
[162:09.30]But...
[162:11.60]Let's do the bits.
[162:12.18]Let me put the camera on.
[162:14.86]We'll just sit here and talk.
[162:20.09]Let's do that.
[162:21.93]Where is it?
[162:22.25]Oh, it's this one here.
[162:26.89]Let's see.
[162:27.71]I'll prove to you guys that I shaved.
[162:30.11]If you want to see.
[162:30.67]Is that going to work?
[162:39.10]No, wrong one.
[162:41.46]This one's cool too, though.
[162:45.00]Where's the camera?
[162:50.07]Oh, there's the camera.
[162:51.87]It just wasn't on.
[163:00.45]Oh, that's what I wanted to do.
[163:01.47]I shaved, see?
[163:06.87]Hey, there we go.
[163:07.49]I got a shaved face.
[163:13.96]I can actually make this smaller.
[163:15.06]Alright, StreamlabsOBS.
[163:23.44]I kind of don't like you at all.
[163:26.31]Because it's hard to move shit around in the scenes.
[163:31.21]You know what I'm talking about?
[163:32.55]It locks shit around.
[163:33.53]I haven't figured out how to turn it off.
[163:39.61]It's almost harder to use.
[163:48.75]Alright, there we go.
[163:50.43]Let's move this over here.
[163:53.59]So... If you're at TwitchCon, say hello.
[163:58.86]If you're not at TwitchCon, then... Whatever, maybe we'll see you on Tuesday.
[164:03.88]Check the nails, too.
[164:05.38]Do those look cut to you?
[164:12.42]Told you.
[164:13.68]Told you I was gonna do it.
[164:15.28]Alright, now I gotta go over here.
[164:18.88]So, I should do this.
[164:23.65]Uh... The music's getting louder, I know.
[164:27.59]Let's do the bits!
[164:29.37]Uh, it shouldn't take us very long.
[164:31.55]We had... I'm not gonna yell over it.
[164:35.03]Uh, Zake!
[164:35.65]Thanks for the 250, Zake!
[164:38.57]You're gonna do a nail painting stream.
[164:41.84]I don't think so.
[164:42.26]I don't think so.
[164:43.55]But thank you, Zake, for the $2.50.
[164:44.73]So I translated the Minecraft copypasta through every other language in Google Translate and back to English.
[164:50.65]And this is what came out.
[164:52.91]In the game, it's awesome.
[164:54.79]Yes, there are peas, peanuts, beans, and various products.
[164:58.53]We hope you enjoy the place.
[165:00.69]Black sauce, pour back.
[165:03.13]But drinking apple pie might not be so good.
[165:10.50]So that is the... that's the intro to Minecraft.
[165:17.80]Well that's... that's good.
[165:19.41]I guess.
[165:25.69]Actually sounds pretty fun.
[165:27.53]Sounds like a fun game.
[165:31.08]Drinking apple pie.
[165:32.04]That's called half the items at Starbucks.
[165:36.61]I wouldn't order them if I were you.
[165:38.49]I would get, like, an iced coffee.
[165:40.02]Don't get anything else.
[165:42.16]Uh... OC... OcRolo, thanks for the thousand bits.
[165:46.44]Please use these measly pennies to buy an eighth of a gigabyte of RAM.
[165:50.56]You need it.
[165:51.86]I need it.
[165:52.18]I'm probably gonna get a new computer.
[165:54.24]It's been about, like, three or four years, so... I'm probably gonna do a new PC soon.
[165:59.63]Within 12 months.
[166:01.63]I want to get, like, a new RTX 2080.
[166:04.49]Get a new, um... Right, 2090?
[166:09.39]Is that coming out soon?
[166:11.75]I know there's one coming out.
[166:14.35]Should I do AMD?
[166:16.09]Should I do AMD instead?
[166:20.10]don't need fully new yeah but I have I have a 6800 or think uh cpu I could do for I could do for an upgrade I want to do like a supercomputer what's the equivalent of the latest intel processors and are they good amd cpu nvidia gpu that's what I was thinking
[166:48.00]AMD CPU.
[166:49.88]You know, I actually heard that AMD really is starting to sincerely give Intel a run for their money.
[166:57.44]Just like their processors are just better now.
[166:59.58]It used to be the complete opposite.
[167:02.48]AMD was always like, oh, you have AMD?
[167:05.48]I've got Intel.
[167:06.72]Intel inside.
[167:07.84]And it was always like, okay, yeah, that's right.
[167:09.92]Intel's way better.
[167:10.62]They're kind of flipping, aren't they?
[167:14.72]Yeah, they're way cheaper, too.
[167:19.19]AMD's gotten considerate a bit.
[167:20.27]Yeah, you know what, I probably will.
[167:21.77]I'll probably do like one of those, what, Threadrippers?
[167:24.17]Just get something crazy.
[167:26.03]And water-cool it.
[167:27.63]But then you can't bring it anywhere, that's the thing.
[167:29.29]Alright, the thing about having a huge, insane supercomputer PC is, yeah, man, this thing's got like liquefied, hydrogenized oil that's cooled to negative 5 degrees Celsius.
[167:40.54]It goes through all these tubes.
[167:42.02]The tubes are made out of glass, by the way.
[167:44.06]So never move this computer.
[167:45.94]Don't ever pick it up.
[167:46.68]Don't even fucking pick it up and put it somewhere else.
[167:48.78]When you put that 112-pound machine somewhere that's a full tower, you ain't moving it ever again.
[167:57.23]I would be so scared to, like, bring that computer anywhere, to ever move.
[168:01.63]I would think I would break everything.
[168:03.10]All the hydrogenized oil would come out.
[168:07.38]It'd be terrifying.
[168:09.76]Even with this one now, it was scary.
[168:12.14]It's kind of heavy and I feel like I'm going to drop it.
[168:14.50]I just need to hire somebody to take care of it.
[168:18.61]It's like having somebody watch your dog.
[168:20.81]You know, like, oh, I'm going away for the week.
[168:22.99]Somebody watch my dog for me.
[168:24.41]I'm going away for the week.
[168:25.11]Somebody watch my computer, please.
[168:30.73]And let him out.
[168:31.86]Let him out a few times.
[168:33.76]And, like, open up the thing at the bottom and it, like, pisses out.
[168:37.22]Stream you building it.
[168:40.36]No.
[168:41.98]I would never build a PC like that.
[168:44.66]That's so much money that I would literally just be deleting because I would break something.
[168:49.10]Having, like, the GPU have the tubes on it that you have to take off, the GPU fan case put on, the Euron's heatsink... No, no, no.
[168:57.94]Somebody else has to do that for me.
[169:00.48]I can put memory into a slot, and I can put video card into slot.
[169:07.44]That's about all I'm comfortable doing.
[169:09.66]I used to be a PC computer doctor, but I lost a lot of business.
[169:14.71]I had like 1.4 stars on Yelp, because I did a stream, and I did a thing where I was like showing people how to build, and I got a lot of flack for it.
[169:23.37]So I was at like a 3.8, and then it went down to 1.4, so I decided I was just gonna kind of just give it up, I guess.
[169:29.73]It's what I was doing for a long time, so...
[169:34.08]And the thing is, most of my customers were old ladies.
[169:36.88]So, I don't know how.
[169:38.18]It was weird how that happened.
[169:39.34]But they'd come in and I would give them the computer back.
[169:42.04]I would fix it.
[169:42.58]I'd do everything I needed to.
[169:44.02]I'd build them a computer.
[169:45.42]And I never got a call.
[169:49.54]I never got a mean phone call or anything.
[169:51.64]They seemed pretty happy about it.
[169:57.88]But anyways, thank you.
[170:00.08]Thank you to, uh, that's, that was Okrolo, Okrolo.
[170:04.66]Many clips, thanks for a thousand bits.
[170:06.08]Here's some bits for a new computer.
[170:07.50]Keep having a good stream.
[170:09.46]It was until I started to drop a bunch of frames.
[170:14.38]And it was happening for long enough where I decided I was just gonna call it.
[170:18.16]So you'll see Hitman again.
[170:21.72]And right when I start talking about it, there it goes.
[170:23.80]It's almost like it can fucking hear me.
[170:27.31]It can fucking hear me talking.
[170:29.61]It can hear me.
[170:30.97]I said that and then it turned off.
[170:34.83]What the fuck is happening?
[170:36.78]Who is listening to this shit and doing this?
[170:39.12]Somebody just sitting there with like a dial from 0 to 10.
[170:42.66]And they're just turning it.
[170:45.92]We haven't had a problem with this in like at least three or four weeks either.
[170:49.19]It's been like a month or so since it was a real issue kind of like this.
[170:52.19]Oh well.
[170:54.13]I'll make a call.
[170:55.77]See if they can do something about it.
[170:58.22]When I'm gone for TwitchCon.
[170:59.64]So, we'll see.
[171:02.16]But... Thank you, Miniclips, for the 1,000 bits.
[171:05.04]Appreciate it.
[171:07.02]Okorolo again gave 500 bits.
[171:09.23]Wait, never mind.
[171:09.77]You'll just spend it on a clown costume.
[171:11.29]Clown costumes are way more expensive than you think.
[171:14.53]It's like $80 to $100 plus for a nice... Maybe even like $200 for a nice clown costume.
[171:21.37]We're not talking just like a t-shirt.
[171:23.81]No, no, no.
[171:24.07]We're talking a silk, fully complete overalls.
[171:28.11]It's way more expensive.
[171:30.71]I'll be in one during the entirety of TwitchCon.
[171:32.87]That's how you'll find me.
[171:33.57]I'll be the clown with the toothpick.
[171:38.35]But thank you for the $10.
[171:39.15]Appreciate it.
[171:41.07]We also had Sad Vega gave $2.50 a belated birthday to you, Jerma.
[171:45.48]How does it feel to be 34?
[171:47.70]It doesn't feel that bad, actually.
[171:48.88]It feels okay.
[171:51.58]It's alright.
[171:52.22]It doesn't bother me.
[171:53.72]When I turned 31, it bothered me.
[171:56.02]When I turned 32, it didn't.
[171:58.56]So, I hope that answers your question.
[172:01.78]But, thank you for the 250.
[172:03.10]Thank you, FatSanic, for the 500 bits.
[172:06.98]No message.
[172:07.98]They just say, cheer 500.
[172:10.14]Thank you, FatSanic.
[172:12.06]I really appreciate it.
[172:13.90]Also, thank you to Gnarly for the 250.
[172:15.72]Is this a stealth game week or something?
[172:17.68]First the Goose game, now Hitman.
[172:19.58]Then, Jerma tries not to be seen at TwitchCon.
[172:26.68]I mean, it is whatever you want to call it.
[172:32.29]What if I really just tried to just not have anybody see me?
[172:35.85]I should tweet out a place that I am, and I'm just not there at all.
[172:39.51]Hey, I'm gonna be standing in front of this statue of the guy from Borderlands!
[172:42.53]And I just, I'm not there.
[172:45.23]And I'm just sitting somewhere else, within distance, within, like, visual line-of-sight distance of that place, and just, like, counting who comes over.
[172:52.42]One, two...
[172:55.60]Three.
[172:57.02]How long has it been?
[172:58.62]Been, uh, two hours.
[172:59.88]Four.
[173:01.39]Okay.
[173:02.85]I got four fans!
[173:04.41]I got four people that like me here!
[173:06.93]And then the next day I know I got four people, so I'm just like, hey, uh, the four of you!
[173:11.27]And people are like, wait, okay, so how did he know that?
[173:15.83]Come visit me at the coffee station.
[173:22.47]No, I'll be there.
[173:23.75]It's Saturday morning is when I'm going to be there the most time.
[173:25.98]Saturday morning into Saturday early afternoon.
[173:28.74]That's the window that I'm going to be at TwitchCon.
[173:33.02]And then I will probably show up at that party for a little while because I've got to, you know, be the toothpick guy.
[173:38.79]And I try to wink with this eye, but I can't wink with my left eye.
[173:45.52]It's too hard for me to do.
[173:47.16]I can only go like this.
[173:48.64]And I have to turn my whole face upside down when I do it.
[173:50.94]I can't wink with my other eye.
[173:52.16]It pulls my mouth over.
[173:53.18]It's weird.
[173:55.57]It's like there's a fishing line here attached to this eye tight to here.
[173:59.51]It's odd.
[174:03.47]But, thank you.
[174:04.59]I appreciate that.
[174:05.93]Thank you also to... Final Fantasy XII...
[174:11.67]Penelo.
[174:13.39]FF12 Penelo.
[174:14.59]I don't know why I just said Final Fantasy.
[174:18.03]Botox.
[174:20.21]Not getting Botox.
[174:22.23]Once you get Botox, that's when you admit that you're old.
[174:24.49]That's my opinion.
[174:25.91]The second that you get Botox injected somewhere, I am admitting that I am old.
[174:32.05]Maybe that'll happen when I'm 45.
[174:32.89]I don't know.
[174:34.75]Maybe it'll never happen.
[174:35.60]Maybe I'll never feel old.
[174:36.78]Maybe I...
[174:39.23]And then if you do it too much, you end up looking... It looks too much, you know?
[174:43.38]It looks like you did it too much.
[174:45.42]No.
[174:46.46]Not gonna happen.
[174:48.76]Just try to age... I'm gonna try to age like a nice red blend.
[174:53.93]Should be alright.
[174:54.49]What do you think about the shave job?
[174:57.27]See you in two days.
[174:58.63]When it looks real good!
[175:01.86]But we only got a few more.
[175:02.66]We got, uh... That was FF12Perelo.
[175:05.82]They said, I turned your stream on at work, promptly forgot I did.
[175:09.10]So when I put my headphones back in, I was like, who the fuck is talking?
[175:11.93]And realized... Anyways, genuinely, thanks for what you do.
[175:16.27]For real, it always cheers me up when I need it.
[175:20.27]I think I would probably be... I was... And that's weird audio to hear, too.
[175:25.44]Playing Hitman and talking about, like, strangling people.
[175:28.16]And poisoning people.
[175:30.10]I don't understand, like, I poisoned him.
[175:31.94]Why is he getting up?
[175:32.65]I poisoned that guy.
[175:34.35]Oh my god, what the fuck, dude?
[175:36.25]Why is he waking up?
[175:37.53]I'm gonna throw an apple at his head.
[175:39.45]He'd be like, I need to get, like, a new computer.
[175:46.44]Oh my god, mug of ass.
[175:50.17]But if you can let me be on at work, hopefully you have it in a situation where it's okay and it's not going to be bad.
[175:59.50]That if you accidentally unplug your headphones and all of a sudden your boss hears me saying fuck, they're not going to think you said it and then you're going to get in trouble.
[176:07.87]So hopefully you got a situation there where it's okay.
[176:09.93]You got like a system.
[176:11.25]You always have to have like a good system.
[176:14.11]And make sure you get your work done too.
[176:16.44]I don't want to burn all your time there because then they're going to blame me.
[176:19.62]What if I get the call from HR?
[176:22.14]What if my stream gets banned from your company?
[176:25.52]That's at least like six or seven followers that I'm going to lose.
[176:30.87]I can't have that.
[176:31.59]Six or seven thousand followers.
[176:42.39]No, but thank you.
[176:44.13]Thank you to NotHugsy.
[176:49.09]They said, fix your internet.
[176:51.28]It's sad because I've fixed this internet probably 15 to 16 times.
[176:58.73]And it'll all be done soon.
[177:00.27]It's all gonna be over soon.
[177:03.23]Fiber to the home.
[177:04.43]I'm gonna be on a direct, thousand-thousand connection.
[177:10.39]True fiber.
[177:11.89]And then we can fucking forget that any of this shit ever happened.
[177:18.65]I'm going to have, like, the best internet you can possibly purchase.
[177:23.23]That is consumer-grade internet, at least.
[177:28.84]I'm going on the fiber diet, that's right.
[177:32.52]I can't wait.
[177:33.88]I can't wait to boot it up and have it be worse than this.
[177:36.91]Which is just not possible.
[177:38.19]If you got direct fiber to the house, no fucking way.
[177:41.57]All these issues are because coax sucks ass.
[177:45.21]Coax cable sucks total asshole.
[177:49.52]It is a fiber optic line.
[177:51.80]So all the dropping the frames, the packet loss, the fucking dropouts, that's all because the cable companies suck.
[177:59.45]And they have laid this fucking groundwork that's been there for like 40 years.
[178:04.71]And they're all dog shit.
[178:06.01]All these lines are trash.
[178:07.82]So now that fiber is being laid out and they have to have it now, you'll be on a... If you can get on an actual to the home fiber, all these issues disappear.
[178:19.17]They don't exist anymore.
[178:20.51]There's no noise.
[178:22.07]There's no like ingress noise and packet problems when you're dealing with a fiber, a true fiber to the home.
[178:28.86]You can have internet problems, but not like you do with coax.
[178:32.34]I fucking hate coax.
[178:34.22]Coax sucks.
[178:35.78]I don't even want it plugged into the back of my fucking TV anymore.
[178:38.42]I'm going saddle- Oops.
[178:49.46]Oops.
[178:50.48]Looks like somebody may have cut the mic.
[178:52.88]By the way, I just realized that there's stuff going on in the background here.
[178:56.49]Is that an I?
[178:57.37]Is that a J?
[178:58.51]What is that?
[178:59.09]There's like a monster on the left.
[179:00.55]I didn't even see that.
[179:04.07]Coax has less latency.
[179:06.11]I would rather have stability than care about a few milliseconds of latency.
[179:10.48]Coax has so many fucking problems.
[179:12.02]It doesn't matter where I am.
[179:13.40]I've used three or four different coax lines, and they would just dog shit.
[179:18.90]So...
[179:20.36]We'll see.
[179:20.96]Maybe I'll have my, maybe fiber is worse, but there's no way it is.
[179:24.46]I've been told by every person that works in like internet infrastructure that if you can get on fiber, get on it because it's a thousand times more stable and better and more consistent than coax.
[179:35.53]So I'm like, thanks.
[179:37.27]I appreciate that.
[179:38.77]And I'm going to be on it in a couple months.
[179:41.09]But I think it's time to see if I set this up correctly.
[179:48.11]If Fiverr is worse, what are you gonna do?
[179:50.61]Um, shit my pants.
[179:51.97]Because at that point, what the fuck am I gonna do?
[179:53.73]I'm gonna have to make my own, I'm gonna have to, like, make my own internet.
[179:58.38]Uh, let's see if this works.
[180:00.50]I wanna see, can it work?
[180:02.62]I just need to, no, never mind, it's not gonna work.
[180:06.36]Oh, he blew it.
[180:08.54]He really blew it, I think.
[180:10.97]Yeah, he did.
[180:13.37]It's alright.
[180:16.11]I didn't, I didn't set it up correctly.
[180:18.54]But thank you to Mark Alter.
[180:22.53]Mark Alter, thanks for the $3.
[180:24.21]Enjoyed the stream.
[180:24.83]Good luck with the internet.
[180:26.21]And I... Oh, I hit you in the eye.
[180:29.39]Now you can't see.
[180:29.97]Sorry.
[180:31.97]Yeah, I'll make a few calls and see what's going on.
[180:33.66]Hopefully they can get somebody out here and just turn the nozzle like apparently they do every time and then it's fine for like a month and a half.
[180:39.16]I don't understand.
[180:40.16]But I will see everybody at TwitchCon.
[180:43.82]Whoever's going, if you go into the show floor, I'll be there on Saturday.
[180:48.00]If not, if you go into the party, if you make it there, I'll be there somewhere dancing with a toothpick.
[180:55.77]Thank you, guys.
[180:57.09]Here come the credits.
[180:59.57]DoorCube, though.
[181:00.27]250 from DoorCube.
[181:01.13]I knew you were going to shave your face in preparation of TwitchCon.
[181:03.35]That's what I told you guys that last night.
[181:05.59]But I didn't realize you were going to get a haircut, too.
[181:07.91]But I guess you needed one since you've been cosplaying as Daniel Klimt from Gremlins 2.
[181:14.35]Is that the guy, the tie guy?
[181:19.45]That's the guy with the tie, right?
[181:22.02]Oh, I know.
[181:24.10]Here come the credits, by the way.
[181:26.92]Thank you, everybody.
[181:29.92]Whoever subbed in this kind of, what, less than two hour period.
[181:33.78]It's still a lot of people, even though streams are going to only be two or three hours long.
[181:38.86]Hope you enjoyed Hitman for as long as we got to play it before I had to stop.
[181:44.53]When I come back on Tuesday, we will do the second Hitman mission, clean it up, do the DLC, finish it up, and move on from there.
[181:54.44]I thought there was something wrong, but that's a person's username.
[181:56.64]I was like, the spacing is incorrect on that.
[182:03.86]This is really slow compared to yesterday.
[182:06.38]Yeah, well, yesterday was also eight hours.
[182:08.88]And that was also the first time I'd really come back at my desk in about eight or nine days.
[182:16.01]This is still a lot of fucking people.
[182:17.49]Do not get me wrong there.
[182:19.47]This is still a shitload of people that will sub in the two hours.
[182:25.50]Hey, CutTac, thanks for the 500-bit stream extension.
[182:30.34]Oh, I see what you do.
[182:31.46]Right, yeah, okay.
[182:33.76]At least I got the last part right.
[183:03.61]Oh, and this last one.
[183:04.43]This is Siroc.
[183:05.75]Thank you, Siroc, for the 250.
[183:06.91]They say, Goat, Hog, Champ, Jerm of Venus.
[183:08.99]It's them watching the stream with a goat.
[183:11.71]Are the anti-mark goats still available?
[183:14.09]Can we confirm?
[183:20.93]I don't think there's probably very many left.
[183:25.85]Let's see.
[183:27.97]Got one?
[183:28.23]You got one?
[183:29.31]Is it over?
[183:29.85]It is over.
[183:30.75]I had to stop because of the internet.
[183:33.82]But it's okay though.
[183:36.48]Because I do have a lot of shit that I still need to take care of before leaving.
[183:40.18]Stuff that is not even TwitchCon related.
[183:41.70]Stuff that is my real life related that I have not been able to do because I've not been here for four or five straight days after I got back.
[183:50.93]I will see you guys soon.
[183:52.87]Take care.
[183:53.25]See you after TwitchCon.
[183:54.33]I might turn the stream on at TwitchCon.
[183:56.97]I don't know why I would though.
[183:58.73]Maybe like eating spaghetti for like 30 minutes.
[184:00.61]It's only going to be like a 20 minute stream if I do.
[184:04.25]But, let me show this to you guys, because it's funny.
[184:10.25]Take a look at that link.
[184:13.40]Get your Andy Mark goat if they're still available, which I don't think they are.
[184:18.78]Thanks for hanging out, everybody.
[184:20.56]See you real soon.
[184:21.84]Take care of yourselves.
[184:25.20]And have a great weekend, regardless if you're going to be at TwitchCon or not.
[184:30.03]See you soon, guys.
[184:37.80]Uh-oh.
[184:38.30]Now there's no audio on this.
[184:40.34]I broke something.
[184:43.44]I broke something.
[184:44.70]I don't... You know what?
[184:45.68]There's just a lot of technical things going on today.
[184:51.40]But before I leave, Boreal Beast gave a thousand bits.
[184:54.18]Hey, Jerma, this is my first time cheering.
[184:56.14]It's my birthday today, and I wanted to give you something back to one of my absolute favorite people as well.
[185:00.28]Love you and your content.
[185:01.46]Thank you so much for always making me laugh and getting me through tough times.
[185:05.08]I know you hear this a lot, but I really mean it.
[185:07.80]Happy fucking birthday.
[185:09.38]Hope you have a great one.
[185:11.12]That was Boreal Beast.
[185:14.74]Anytime I hear about the stream people like and people have a great time here, it makes me... Don't worry.
[185:19.40]I know you hear this a lot.
[185:21.68]Kind of scenario.
[185:23.22]Every time somebody says that, it doesn't matter how many times I hear it.
[185:26.19]It makes me happy every single time.
[185:28.29]Thank you.
[185:29.37]And thanks for the thousand bits.
[185:32.17]And then HeatLegend, thanks for $2.50.
[185:33.73]While I can't attend TwitchCon, I hope you have a great time in San Diego.
[185:36.89]It rained for the first time today in over a month, so I hope the weather isn't shitty for you when you get here.
[185:41.67]This will be the first time I've been to San Diego as well.
[185:44.79]Well, not as well.
[185:47.21]You live there, I think, as it sounds.
[185:49.66]But yeah, this is the first time being there.
[185:53.16]I will see you guys later.
[185:55.34]Take care.
[185:56.40]Good night.
[185:57.64]I gotta go get ready.
[185:59.38]See you soon.
