[ve:61.1.100]

[00:02.49]It's apparently very 80s.
[00:03.83]Okay, RoboCop.
[00:09.47]Let's try it out.
[00:11.61]If you're wondering, hey, why are you playing RoboCop like a year after it released?
[00:16.66]Because it was on sale for $3 or something like two days ago.
[00:20.76]So I was like, oh shit.
[00:22.64]Maybe I'll get it.
[00:29.61]I don't think I'm making that up.
[00:33.60]Did I make that up?
[00:34.34]It was on sale for... Oh my god!
[00:36.38]Alright, here we go.
[00:52.32]My computer's already lagging.
[00:54.18]I can already feel it like chugging so bad.
[00:56.16]You see what I mean?
[01:02.59]Alright, let's see if it loads.
[01:04.17]It was okay when I got in the game.
[01:07.33]Are these settings just too high?
[01:20.64]Nice resolution.
[01:21.86]What?
[01:22.62]This is a 4K, dude.
[01:27.87]It's 4K.
[01:30.42]I don't want to play in 1080p.
[01:32.77]That's dinosaur shit.
[01:38.09]Ow, my stomach.
[01:40.89]It's because you played in 4K high quality.
[01:47.92]Now you want me to go back to the Stone Age?
[01:49.90]Alright, let's go.
[01:55.60]Let's turn it up.
[01:59.10]Put DLSS on performance.
[02:01.69]If it sucks, I'll fix it.
[02:09.75]Normal.
[02:10.11]Alright, how hard is Robocop?
[02:25.33]It's extremely easy.
[02:31.08]Can I change this in the settings if it's too hard?
[02:35.46]I'll do hard.
[02:50.29]You give us three minutes and we give you the world.
[02:54.60]I'm Casey Wong.
[02:55.80]A military submarine that went missing over three years ago has suddenly reappeared in the Baltic Sea.
[03:01.82]Confused seamen mistakenly opened fire on the last Lapland reservation, killing 12.
[03:08.78]Thankfully, our homesick sailors are back on U.S.
[03:11.74]soil.
[03:12.68]Welcome back, boys.
[03:14.26]In local news, a new crime wave that is sweeping Detroit has already claimed the lives of 21 police officers.
[03:21.66]Here's a statement from the head of OCP, Omni Consumer Products, that's funding and running the Detroit Police Department.
[03:29.29]Old Detroit has a cancer, and that cancer is crime.
[03:33.03]It must be cut out, and OCP holds the scalpel.
[03:36.89]According to our sources the attacks were aimed at catching the attention of a man whose identity remains unknown Boys game on doing business in Old Detroit There seems to be a Disturbance I'm a big fan Who's this guy?
[04:01.87]What the fuck?
[04:08.20]My computer sucks.
[04:09.30]Why is it running like this?
[04:18.40]It seems that you're looking to spend some money in this great city of ours.
[04:22.36]I'm here to tell you that the Torchheads are open for business.
[04:27.50]You may have heard of us as the number one supplier of nuke in Old Detroit.
[04:31.70]Who said Ludwig?
[04:32.64]Somebody said Ludwig.
[04:36.02]In front of every convenience store, school, or library near you.
[04:41.49]But that's not all we're capable of.
[04:48.13]Let's get you up here.
[04:49.45]I gotta turn my graphics down.
[04:56.22]Officer Howard, to illustrate the point.
[04:59.86]You see, Officer Howard made a drug bust that cost us a lot of money.
[05:05.61]We want to reward this dutiful officer with a performance bonus.
[05:11.05]A lifetime supply of nuke.
[05:15.35]Oh, man.
[05:16.19]You're gonna have the time of your life.
[05:18.31]What the fuck was he doing?
[05:19.14]There you go.
[05:22.84]What?
[05:23.32]Enjoy.
[05:25.40]New guy.
[05:26.64]Us Torchheads are more than capable of doing whatever you need done in our city.
[05:31.28]They nuked him?
[05:33.35]What is it, huh?
[05:35.07]Arson?
[05:35.83]Smuggling?
[05:37.07]Drug dealing?
[05:38.17]Good old-fashioned murder?
[05:40.11]We do it all.
[05:42.03]You've got the money.
[05:43.55]We've got the power.
[05:45.51]so let's talk alright let's go I know I'm gonna have to get in there as Robocop what is the tell me the synopsis it's running pretty good this is actually running way better now that we're kind of like in the game engine
[06:16.86]Yeah.
[06:21.08]There he is.
[06:21.62]It's not bad.
[06:28.88]This is not bad, actually.
[06:31.18]This is alright.
[06:55.69]Actually looks kind of good.
[07:05.60]What are you doing outside?
[07:06.62]It's dangerous.
[07:11.90]Why are there only two people here?
[07:19.77]Turn on DLSS.
[07:20.73]I think I crashed my computer.
[07:23.20]NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution.
[07:25.14]Is that what you want me to do?
[07:26.30]Auto?
[07:51.89]Holy shit!
[07:52.93]What the hell is that setting?
[07:57.33]What is that setting?
[07:58.17]You just increased my frames by like a hundred!
[08:00.44]It renders in a lower resolution then uses magic to make it look better?
[08:05.66]Is that real?
[08:23.11]Oh shit.
[08:33.15]Just make sure you do not eat bananas with diazepam.
[08:37.05]It is bad.
[08:37.87]It can give you heartburn.
[08:47.32]Trouble Cup, that's not even real.
[08:50.04]I'm sorry, my AI has been poisoned.
[09:05.44]We can't wait any longer.
[09:06.76]Those sugar-happy maniacs have a ton of hostages.
[09:09.78]Oh, he looks good, too.
[09:11.30]He's shiny.
[09:12.80]Roger that.
[09:14.68]Over and out.
[09:17.14]What is the situation?
[09:19.16]Goddamn OCP tells us to stand down till SWAT arrives.
[09:23.22]That's our situation.
[09:24.24]Why does he have lip gloss on?
[09:26.56]Not so fast, buddy.
[09:27.56]Who do you think is gonna clean up this place?
[09:31.00]I'm not letting you off that easily.
[09:32.78]You sound just like my wife.
[09:34.97]If that's the case, let's get you patched up.
[09:37.95]We wouldn't want to get on the bad side.
[09:40.70]Press here.
[09:41.16]I want to see.
[09:42.56]Medic.
[09:49.02]There you are, partner.
[09:49.94]He doesn't have a... Maybe.
[09:53.30]The hell is going on up there?
[10:00.56]Sorry, dude.
[10:02.06]The police want us to release the hostages.
[10:06.32]So no hard feelings.
[10:08.02]Oh, shit.
[10:09.93]My Jeff impression was better than that one.
[10:12.73]Hey, you can't go in yet.
[10:14.33]We need to wait for the reinforcements.
[10:16.03]We both just tried to do Jeff.
[10:16.87]Reinforcements have arrived.
[10:18.71]I knew you'd say something like that.
[10:25.25]We need to find another way.
[10:27.27]It is too dangerous to cross.
[10:29.83]Yeah, I can take it.
[10:31.39]He even has the walk too.
[10:33.51]Do I go that slow in the game?
[10:34.35]That'd be so funny if you did.
[10:51.65]What do you do if you see this guy walking in here?
[10:55.39]I run.
[10:56.33]Oh shit.

[12:05.53]I think this might be.
[12:07.51]This is an M game, apparently.
[12:12.37]I thought I was gonna be like, drop it, scum, and then I was gonna punch them or throw them through a window.
[12:16.90]I just started fucking annihilating people.
[12:25.97]Alright, that's better.

[20:31.35]OK.
[20:38.31]Clue.
[20:42.85]Short circuit detected.
[20:43.86]I am detecting a short circuit.
[20:48.06]We need to isolate the cables.
[20:50.26]I think I've got something just for that.
[20:56.84]Bubble gum, really?
[21:01.46]You are very resourceful.
[21:03.78]Thanks, but I'd say it was a team effort.
[21:08.93]They're holding everyone in the studio.
[21:10.59]Oh, those man heels.
[21:12.07]You can just hear like the... Uh-oh.
[21:29.11]So, our friends in blue finally decided to join our glamorous show.
[21:34.95]I'm afraid you're too late for my autograph.
[21:38.28]I thought that was us looking in the... I thought that was our mirror of us.
[21:42.80]You know when your iPhone dies and you see yourself in the mirror?
[21:47.14]I was like, where's his helmet off?
[22:08.18]Wait, it was?
[22:09.66]Wait, that was... Was it her?
[22:12.40]Wait, wasn't that... Wait, was his helmet on?
[22:15.07]How did I not see that?
[22:16.11]I'm sorry.
[22:19.17]I'm very... He sees him... Oh, right.
[22:21.97]He sees himself as a human.
[22:22.77]You're gonna take that back.
[22:39.33]It's been a long time since I've seen them.
[22:46.64]Catch it!
[22:47.22]Catch it!
[22:55.08]How far can I walk around?
[23:03.17]There's a lot of people in there.
[23:05.05]Way too many people in there.
[23:06.05]Hold on.
[23:07.21]Too many people.
[23:08.21]Way too many.
[23:10.44]Oh, yeah.
[23:11.24]Sorry.
[23:11.90]I'm scared.
[23:14.38]You handle it for now.
[23:15.30]I'm so sorry.
[23:16.68]I don't know what to do in this.
[23:25.66]This thing's got electricity on it.
[23:35.41]It's very pretty looking, though.
[23:36.41]It's a beautiful looking game.
[23:38.35]Where is it?
[23:43.29]Oh.
[23:48.19]What?
[23:49.71]You can throw computers at people?
[23:56.11]Oh shit, I missed.

[25:56.54]I want to pick... I want to pick it up.
[26:01.22]I wish I could jump.
[26:02.08]Robocop doesn't have springs in his feet like fucking Inspector Gadget.

[27:35.61]Requesting urgent medical assistance.
[27:37.49]Over.
[27:37.99]How come nobody told me to play this game like a year ago?

[30:13.67]It feels like I need the health and I have to actually play kind of OK.
[30:30.64]Hold on.
[30:31.00]No, no, no.
[30:31.22]Don't blow that up.

[32:03.96]How are you missing with an aim lock?
[32:06.15]It's not an aim lock.
[32:07.15]It's just like a, hey, look, there's a guy there.
[32:22.27]You mean I can't snip somebody?
[32:24.39]I can't cut their head off with that?
[32:39.96]Or at least throw it at them?
[32:47.33]What happened?
[32:48.03]Why is there so much blood up there?
[32:51.38]Hold on, did I shoot that guy?
[32:52.88]And he's like... What?
[32:56.14]Why has the door gone?
[32:58.70]I need to rebind that.
[33:02.86]This game is hilarious.
[33:04.22]I love it.
[33:06.44]Heal.
[33:06.92]Okay, night vision melee attack.

[34:34.88]What the hell am I doing?
[34:55.48]James really looks up to you.
[34:57.65]He said in school that he wants to be a police officer just like his dad.
[35:05.07]Watch out!
[35:05.75]He's coming!
[35:07.27]Kill the hostages!
[35:08.71]Don't!
[35:08.95]No, no, no, no!
[35:09.54]Don't do that!
[35:09.98]Oh!
[35:14.22]Everyone okay?
[35:29.26]You can't go through that.
[35:32.30]Do not.
[35:32.76]Don't do it.
[35:34.78]Everyone's fine.
[35:36.60]Guys.
[35:38.12]We are all good.
[35:40.45]You are safe.
[35:56.06]There were less people than they're showing me right now.
[36:03.72]Oh.
[36:08.33]No sudden moves, cop.
[36:10.25]I'm not dying here.
[36:12.05]Get me another one of those choppers like the one that took sight.
[36:16.24]You hear me?
[36:18.76]So hard, honey.
[36:20.12]Why don't you take some leave?
[36:21.82]We all could use a little break from this reality, don't you think?
[36:25.58]Wakey, wakey!
[36:26.86]I'm talking to you, shiny!
[36:28.74]Stand back from that door, or I'll shoot her!
[36:31.16]I swear to Nuke!
[36:32.70]I don't know what I would do if I ever lost you.
[36:36.72]You've got three seconds!
[36:38.60]Three!
[36:39.94]Our family is the only thing I need to be happy.
[36:43.48]Two!
[36:44.32]Are you fucking deaf?
[36:45.88]Promise me, you will stay like this forever.
[36:49.26]One!
[36:50.08]Last chance, weirdo!
[36:51.98]I love you so much, but I need to see you now.
[36:58.09]I thought he shot himself for a second.
[36:59.61]I was like, what?
[37:01.53]You okay there, Murphy?
[37:03.35]I was like, why did he?
[37:12.91]Oh, no.
[37:15.90]What does it want?
[37:16.50]Get it away from me.
[37:19.40]I am sorry.
[37:22.75]Can you see it's unstable?
[37:24.73]Ma'am, please calm down.
[37:26.45]It's been a very tough evening and I assure you that everyone wants to be back home.
[37:31.21]He crashed, yeah.
[37:32.00]He can't.
[37:33.58]I walked over a trip wire and blew up.
[37:35.20]This is the intro.
[37:54.32]That was crazy.
[38:14.21]Hey, that'd be a good steam demo for one of the demo fests.
[38:18.09]But I mean, why this game came out a year and a half ago?
[38:20.41]What am I talking about?
[38:26.14]Get back in line.
[38:26.66]They're here.
[38:44.93]Is Robocop in Fortnite?
[38:45.45]He is, isn't he?
[38:45.81]Of course he is.
[38:47.28]Alright, alright.
[38:47.96]Are you done with this circle jerk, huh?
[38:49.82]Good.
[38:50.02]We've got a problem.
[39:08.25]Uh-oh.
[39:08.47]Uh-oh.
[39:38.71]It's true.
[39:39.27]That's not fair.
[39:39.93]Oh my god!
[39:41.19]Dude, what?
[40:06.33]Max Becker.
[40:34.65]Now that's a cigarette name if I've ever heard one.
[40:37.85]I get to walk around in the precinct?
[40:41.51]New objective?
[40:44.06]I still have bird shit on me.
[40:47.18]How do I get the bird shit off?
[41:04.31]What are you writing?
[41:05.93]But I have a sip of your diet soda.
[41:10.91]I am programmed to like things that you like.
[41:15.47]Did you know that diet soda has aspartame in it?
[41:20.99]It's what gives it its distinctive flavor.
[41:28.68]Carry on.
[41:36.81]Oh, I want one of these.
[41:39.69]Oh, sorry.
[41:41.29]Oh, I want one of these.
[41:43.97]Typewriter.
[41:46.71]Where's my desk?
[41:47.37]Do I have a desk?
[41:53.89]Why do you have a Star Trek thing?
[41:56.73]Stinky situation?
[42:01.27]I need to track stinky situation.
[42:14.69]Move him to the drunk tank?
[42:15.91]Okay, pick up the drunkard.
[42:17.73]Okay.
[42:51.18]Quiet.
[42:55.54]This is not right.
[42:56.54]This is the wrong room.
[42:57.60]I apologize.
[42:58.98]Anybody know where the drunk tank is?
[43:06.78]Oh man, I really am defective.
[43:08.20]I don't know what to do.
[43:12.60]Look who's back home.
[43:14.24]Just toss him in one of the empty cells.
[43:21.29]Ah, finally.
[43:22.85]That was a quest.
[43:26.43]I can't believe you do quests in RoboCop.
[43:30.75]RoboPig!
[43:32.32]Why do you have to spoil our fun all the time?
[43:34.50]You metal freak!
[43:41.67]Did this guy get shot in the head?
[43:55.26]Go to the holding cell.
[43:56.77]Wait, is it over here?
[43:59.31]Oh no, I think it's up.
[44:06.92]This game is fun though.
[44:07.98]I'm in it.
[44:10.06]I'm in it.
[44:11.18]All the Chrono Trigger fans are going to be upset about this.
[44:15.20]But I ain't leaving this for a little bit.
[44:19.76]Locked and loaded.
[44:30.40]Also coming up on another break here too.
[44:34.71]My damn locker won't open.
[44:36.35]Can you try?
[44:36.95]Easy.
[44:39.25]Wait, what is all this shit doing in my locker?
[44:45.06]We wanted you to be safe out there.
[44:46.40]I thought these were grenades.
[44:47.72]What are these?
[44:49.84]Yeah, you guys, very funny.
[44:53.38]Are they grenades?
[44:54.06]What are you guys doing?
[44:54.74]Don't be fucking idiots.
[45:20.10]It is cool just to kind of walk around.
[45:22.34]Who's the Half-Life scientist?
[45:30.86]Alright, I'm going to take a break.
[45:32.78]This is really fun though.
[45:35.40]I'm in it.
[45:35.88]I think I'm going to play for at least a couple hours at least.
[45:41.38]I think it auto-saved, so.
[45:46.96]Do the robo voice.
[45:51.29]Maybe.
[45:51.57]Let's see what I can do.
[45:54.96]We're back.
[45:58.70]Wait, maybe I can do it right now.
[45:59.76]Can you tell me how awful this sounds?
[46:08.76]It would need... Yeah, hold on.
[46:09.86]This is going to be awful if I don't turn it down.
[46:13.63]I'll test it right now.
[46:24.16]My go XLR is like messed up.
[46:26.30]I can't do it.
[46:27.92]Unfortunately.
[46:31.04]My go XLR is broken.
[46:35.30]I need a new one of these.
[46:36.12]I'm going to do a whole new setup.
[46:47.61]Whispering.
[46:48.01]Yeah.
[46:50.75]Alright, I'll be right back.
[46:52.03]See you guys in three or four minutes.
[46:55.16]See you after the ads.
[51:06.76]Just, hello.
[51:08.97]Taking care of Otto.
[51:09.61]Another minute or two.
[51:13.13]Be right back.
[54:29.64]Okay, I am back.
[54:31.86]I made a coffee, too.
[54:32.90]This felt like one.
[54:38.52]Night streaming.
[54:40.06]Coffee.
[54:52.65]Alright.
[54:53.79]Let's go back to it.
[55:02.33]Is my album coming out?
[55:06.69]I don't know.
[55:07.59]Okay, let's get on with it.
[55:10.45]Everybody ready?
[55:11.49]We good?
[55:12.41]Let's go.
[55:16.79]Ah, nice coffee.
[55:17.53]A nice just black coffee at like 8 o'clock at night.
[55:21.57]That's like the weirdo shit that I'm about right now.
[55:30.83]Why don't you take a seat for me?
[55:38.23]I swear they're going to get in my head and see.
[55:42.27]That's a nasty scar.
[55:44.69]I'd like to see the other guy.
[55:46.31]Am I right?
[55:47.27]You do not.
[55:48.69]Trust me.
[55:49.63]Don't mind me.
[55:50.67]I'll just get this off.
[55:51.89]Who's the voice actor for Robocop in this game?
[55:54.45]Did they get him?
[55:58.24]So here's the deal, Robo.
[56:00.52]The old man is not happy with your performance.
[56:04.74]It sounds great.
[56:05.26]Instead of sending you to the scrapyard as I suggested...
[56:09.78]They actually got him back?
[56:11.56]Really?
[56:11.86]That's actually pretty cool.
[56:13.10]Sounds great.
[56:13.70]You sure know how to make an impression on the ladies.
[56:17.71]Doesn't it hurt him?
[56:19.41]Hurt?
[56:20.29]Lady, he's a machine.
[56:22.27]He's legally dead.
[56:24.02]We can do whatever we want with them.
[56:25.76]No, madam.
[56:26.94]It does not hurt me physically.
[56:29.12]So we're going to equip you with a little monitoring chip.
[56:32.50]It will do a real-time check of your systems so we can get to the bottom of what the hell is wrong with you.
[56:37.44]From now on, your performance will be monitored and graded.
[56:41.42]So better be on your best behavior.
[56:43.34]Is this how we get S ranks and A ranks?
[56:45.44]Is that the lore reason for that?
[56:47.40]The chip is in.
[56:49.46]Let's see what we have here.
[56:57.48]okay oh a thousand experience points for all objectives complete investigations oh t I didn't do anything correct I got one TV station thing I got a c
[57:26.58]C for Robocop.
[57:29.32]I am okay.
[57:30.22]I am pleased with this outcome.
[57:36.83]Each time you achieve a new level, you receive a skill point that can be used to develop your skills.
[57:41.99]I mean, this has got to be a throw people skill, right?
[57:47.16]Obtain unique perks and unlock favorable dialog options?
[57:54.45]Deductions?
[57:55.29]Psychology?
[57:56.17]What do you mean, psychology?
[58:03.71]Is this game way more involved than I thought it was?
[58:07.46]What if we just go all the way in psychology?
[58:13.42]Okay.
[58:14.84]0% lower requirements for all dialog options.
[58:16.74]Double earned public trust points.
[58:19.18]Highlights favorable dialog options and lowers outcome thresholds for the main characters.
[58:29.06]Deduction is experience.
[58:31.18]Enhanced map locations.
[58:32.76]Oh, actually I might want this.
[58:37.40]Combat.
[58:39.34]This is weapon damage.
[58:42.58]Shield.
[58:44.62]Health points.
[58:46.26]Engineering.
[58:47.38]Allows a dash?
[58:54.71]I don't know.
[58:57.39]Focus is slow motion.
[59:00.33]We get a slow motion button.
[59:02.79]Scanning.
[59:03.35]Oh, this is the boring one.
[59:07.21]Probably useful.
[59:08.80]No combat, all dialog.
[59:15.46]Ricochet is cool.
[59:18.96]That is cool.
[59:23.30]I'm going to regret this, but
[59:28.38]Just do a charisma build in RoboCop.
[59:38.92]Robotherapist.
[59:42.06]Don't do it.
[59:42.70]Do it.
[59:43.12]Don't do it.
[59:43.90]Charisma playthrough.
[59:44.98]I'm curious.
[59:46.24]We'll get more points.
[59:48.46]Let's do it.
[59:52.38]So now I doubled my public trust points.
[59:55.18]I don't even know what that means, but let's do it.
[59:57.54]I'm doing it.
[60:03.54]This is hard mode, by the way.
[60:05.42]That's right.
[60:05.98]That might be a bad idea.
[60:11.53]Everything seems to be installed correctly.
[60:14.53]To be sure, let's make a simple test to check that all circuits are in order.
[60:19.13]What are your prime directives?
[60:21.34]Serve the public trust, protect the innocent, uphold the law.
[60:27.74]Okay, nothing disturbed.
[60:29.74]However, like with any new upgrade, I recommend visiting the range to check if you need calibration.
[60:34.18]Is that everything?
[60:36.98]Actually, no.
[60:38.24]Doctor?
[60:39.30]Oh, yes, sorry.
[60:41.30]My name is Dr. Olivia Blanch.
[60:43.28]I'm a police psychologist.
[60:45.39]I specialize in dealing with police officers suffering from emotional trauma.
[60:50.31]Emotional trauma?
[60:51.17]He's ugly.
[60:51.79]Might as well talk to the microwave.
[60:53.37]How dare you talk about Robocop that way.
[60:55.75]OCP wanted to see if you'd be willing to have a talk with me as part of your evaluation.
[61:00.73]I noticed that a great deal of care has been put into making sure that your mechanical components work.
[61:06.73]However, one aspect of your composition that has been severely neglected is your human side.
[61:12.38]Your brain.
[61:14.44]My brain.
[61:16.58]I agree.
[61:17.12]If it was up to me, I'd remove it altogether.
[61:19.62]What do you think, Doctor?
[61:20.50]It would save us a lot of hassle.
[61:23.78]That's a dick.
[61:24.50]I don't mind the hassle.
[61:26.92]So what do you say, officer?
[61:29.68]Is that possibly something that could be of interest to you?
[61:33.80]I am not sure.
[61:40.54]Robo, read once everyone in the briefing room in five.
[61:43.52]It's about the new guy.
[61:47.86]Have you gotten to the part where you shoot the penis yet?
[61:49.78]Okay, dude.
[61:50.02]Can I throw the television?
[61:53.43]Okay, that was cool.
[61:54.09]Let's go.
[62:20.21]Huh?
[62:20.35]What do you need?
[62:49.10]Get in line.
[62:50.90]Reed is in the briefing room and I have my hands full.
[62:54.22]I have to take complaints?
[62:54.92]There are so many complaints filing in that I can't keep up.
[62:58.23]It's getting crazy in here.
[63:00.07]Could you open up another line and help me?
[63:03.35]I am here to serve the public trust.
[63:06.75]What do I have to do?
[63:07.67]Take the spot on the podium.
[63:09.25]You're a lifesaver, Robo.
[63:10.91]What?
[63:12.79]Oh no.
[63:13.49]This line is open.
[63:15.13]Please form an orderly queue.
[63:18.37]Jealous of dog.
[63:19.01]You're pissing... Okay.
[63:21.15]Okay.
[63:21.39]Uh...
[63:50.39]Uh, that's disrupting public order.
[63:54.21]I thought you were going to say that your dog is like pissing and shitting on other people's lawns.
[64:05.48]No, but he's a dog lover.
[64:09.39]Disrupting public trust.
[64:10.59]Your behavior disrupts public order.
[64:12.65]I must issue a ticket.
[64:14.73]That's fine.
[64:15.39]I don't mind paying the price for having the cutest dog in all of Detroit.
[64:19.46]Next, please.
[64:20.48]I got something for you, officer.
[64:26.08]I know where you can find a wanted criminal.
[64:29.46]That poster over there says there's a reward for that information.
[64:34.35]And I want it.
[64:35.95]I want details.
[64:37.77]Are you blind?
[64:39.37]I'm the guy from that poster, so... Oh, okay.
[64:42.59]Here I am.
[64:43.73]Now, give me the money.
[64:45.97]I will have to detain you.
[64:48.05]Fine, but I still get the reward, right?
[64:57.78]I did turn yourself in.
[65:05.08]But what is the crime though?
[65:08.98]I'm sorry.
[65:10.92]You do not.
[65:12.10]You cops don't appreciate honesty.
[65:15.12]Take him away.
[65:16.71]Next, please.
[65:19.75]Officer, I would like to report my son missing.
[65:22.51]Okay.
[65:23.09]How old is he?
[65:25.63]He's 24, but he's never been gone for so long without letting me know.
[65:29.79]How long has it been?
[65:31.83]I. OK, well, here's the thing.
[65:33.64]If you if you have a like a really good relationship with your mother.
[65:57.61]And, I mean, I don't know, maybe this is out of the ordinary, right?
[66:00.45]This could be completely out of the ordinary.
[66:03.71]Let's get a few more details.
[66:05.69]What is his name and address?
[66:07.93]George Elkins, 7706 Orchard Avenue.
[66:16.16]Your son was found... Oh, shit.
[66:19.90]Two hours ago.
[66:21.72]What?
[66:23.37]Oh, no.
[66:28.41]Oh, no.
[66:30.25]Well... Hey, hey, hey.
[66:32.77]Sometimes, guys, sometimes a mother knows.
[66:34.99]Sometimes a mother knows best.
[66:40.06]Yeah, sometimes you gotta trust the mother.
[66:42.20]Gotta trust the mother.
[66:50.12]Alright, let's keep going.
[66:50.88]Uh, shooting range.
[66:52.41]Okay.
[66:53.11]Is it down?
[66:59.39]How do I get downstairs?
[67:00.95]I forget.
[67:06.36]Could you please install the Fable 2 breadcrumb into my UI?
[67:11.18]I should just smash through the ceiling.
[67:16.39]Just go down.
[67:16.89]There it is.
[67:36.49]Calibrate me.
[67:37.03]Score at least 50 points.
[67:38.67]What is it?
[67:39.83]Am I going too slow?
[68:07.46]Unless you want to try to break the record.
[68:47.98]score at least 50 points dude I'm this is like kind of unfair I'm a robot so
[69:19.22]Oh, he's still going.
[69:43.06]376?
[69:43.90]Ugh.
[69:44.08]That guy's got like three achievements.
[69:48.41]I just got three achievements.
[69:55.69]Okay, let's go.
[70:03.46]Hi!
[70:17.19]Alright, let's go.
[70:17.87]Mission time.
[70:18.39]I feel like I aggressively punched that open.
[70:22.84]The crime has been on the rise ever since what the media has named the new guy in town showed up in the city.
[70:28.92]The word on the street is that he wants to spend a lot of money in old Detroit and that has made every gang in the city start advertising their services.
[70:38.01]We need to find him before things get out of control.
[70:41.79]Where do we look?
[70:43.27]Our best bet is to see if he made contact with a torch head.
[70:46.05]Do you drive a car in this game?
[70:47.07]Robo, I want you to start by checking the arcade downtown.
[70:50.41]It's become a high activity area for punks.
[70:53.29]Understood.
[70:54.73]Everyone else, keep your eyes open.
[70:57.11]Any questions?
[70:58.65]Any word on Briggs?
[71:00.57]What happened to Briggs?
[71:02.27]He's been missing since yesterday.
[71:04.61]Shit.
[71:05.73]Officer Briggs remains missing.
[71:07.57]That's over 24 hours since he's been in contact with anyone here.
[71:11.38]Are the two cases connected?
[71:14.28]No reason to assume so, but if anyone finds Briggs informant, we might learn something new.
[71:20.04]Alright, now get out there.
[71:25.62]You go ahead partner understood.
[71:27.20]I need to write this report and there's something else I need to do first.
[71:34.49]Understood.
[71:37.47]Be me out of here.
[71:47.78]Yeah, I was going to say, I didn't want to say it.
[71:50.30]I get to drive.
[71:51.60]Can I drive?
[71:53.90]Wait, yeah, I get to drive.
[71:56.52]Come on.
[71:57.54]Let me drive.
[72:01.60]Let me do it.
[72:02.18]Is there a driving?
[72:15.49]Is it like an open world or something?
[72:24.00]I don't think so.
[72:43.66]You came to clean up this city, didn't you?
[72:46.56]I did.
[72:47.22]It'd be easier to burn it all to the ground.
[72:50.90]Believe me, just burn it all.
[72:54.31]Okay, so search for soot.
[73:04.28]Is this where my dialog options come into play?
[73:06.24]That is a bright fire.
[73:07.82]I feel like you're going to be burning.
[73:10.50]This is too high.
[73:12.71]That's too intense.
[73:16.33]You missed a cat?
[73:17.19]Where?
[73:24.41]Where's the cat?
[73:35.20]Oh man, I missed the cat.
[73:39.52]As a police officer, you can issue tickets for misdemeanors like public drinking and disorderly conduct or traffic violations.
[73:48.66]Oh, this person's parked next to a fire hydrant.
[73:51.85]That is illegal.
[73:54.05]Obstruction of the fire hydrant.
[74:00.95]One parking ticket is all it takes to improve mindfulness.
[74:05.70]Huh?
[74:05.90]On it.
[74:22.84]It's a blue Sucks 6000.
[74:27.59]And this is a car?
[74:28.59]A blue Sucks 6000.
[74:30.89]I feel like you wouldn't want to name your car something like a Sucks.
[74:40.84]Start talking.
[74:42.73]Hey, I might be a little late filing my tax return, but sending a one-man army seems like an overreaction.
[74:48.28]I am here to investigate the theft of a blue SU-X6000 that belongs to Melissa Cusack.
[74:54.48]Fancy car and fancy name, but I hardly ever get the pleasure of dealing with either.
[74:59.53]Do you have any information about the whereabouts of this vehicle?
[75:03.55]To be honest, I did some work on one of those cars recently.
[75:07.35]but I can assure you that it was not the one you're looking for.
[75:10.67]Do I have your permission to search the shop?
[75:14.27]I know what the world's like, but can't a man go about his business without being harassed all the damn time?
[75:21.14]Psychology 2.
[75:23.24]I got him.
[75:25.62]And you guys didn't want me to put points in that.
[75:31.85]Concealment of information detected.
[75:34.76]You think you can scare me with that technical mumbo jumbo?
[75:37.08]I was just saying that to somebody.
[75:38.52]Come clean now or there will be six repercussions.
[75:41.28]How would he know?
[75:43.14]Okay, you win.
[75:45.48]So there's this boy, Scott.
[75:47.76]He works for me on and off.
[75:49.74]He might have something to do with your case.
[75:52.33]Let me open his locker for you.
[75:56.67]Lying detective.
[75:59.19]Go on, have a look.
[76:03.51]That's the kind of shit that you do, like you say in like an argument with somebody, you know, like, oh, boop, boop, boop, like lying detected, lying detected.
[76:10.28]Here we go.
[76:11.12]Here we go.
[76:11.86]And that just worked.
[76:20.69]And what do you reckon?
[76:22.33]Is he your man?
[76:23.73]That's a nerd thing to do.
[76:24.83]Alright.
[76:25.83]Big bang theory argument?
[76:26.91]Okay.
[76:56.08]Tell me about Scott.
[76:57.34]Tell me why you think he is responsible.
[77:01.36]He's young, bright, and would like to rule the world.
[77:04.60]I get it.
[77:05.56]But nearly every month he gets himself in trouble.
[77:08.35]It is not enough to make assumptions.
[77:11.13]I'm not a cop, but I've seen many things in my life.
[77:14.03]And where there's smoke, there's usually fire.
[77:16.19]Okay.
[77:21.38]Why did you cover for him?
[77:23.75]I can't watch a decent kid like him get swallowed by this city.
[77:27.54]Don't look at me like that.
[77:29.16]Instead of giving him up, I was encouraging him to come clean.
[77:32.40]But a man can only try.
[77:33.50]Okay.
[77:36.92]That is all for now.
[77:39.02]Hey, make sure no harm comes his way.
[77:42.06]He might have done some foolish things in the past, but he's a good kid and he deserves another chance.
[77:47.11]He started screaming in my face.
[77:47.99]The court of law will be the judge of that.
[77:53.42]excellent thank you for the information by the way this wouldn't happen to be a chevy 2001 uh fuck let me just skip to the part of the joke that I wanted to do you mind if I have a drink
[78:33.11]I don't know cars, guys.
[78:34.37]I don't know anything about cars.
[78:38.51]I know what a Ford F-150 is.
[78:41.31]I know what a... A Chevy... Is it a Camaro?
[78:46.83]I thought you said Robocop wasn't a detective.
[78:53.10]Well, sometimes you gotta slow it down.
[78:54.28]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[78:54.96]Are we going in here?
[78:57.22]He's over here.
[79:08.92]Open up.
[79:19.94]Find Scott's whereabouts.
[79:31.42]No.
[79:36.59]No, what are these rooms?
[79:40.01]But there might be secrets or evidence or something.
[79:43.48]Uh oh.
[79:44.60]What's going on?
[79:45.22]Psychology 2.
[79:50.90]Lie.
[80:07.16]You can't possibly help me.
[80:08.58]I don't want to cause any more trouble, especially for Ben.
[80:18.60]Our actions have consequences.
[80:19.66]Our actions affect people around us.
[80:22.60]Do you mean Ben?
[80:24.24]Shit!
[80:25.46]Is he alright?
[80:26.76]Is Ben okay?
[80:27.94]Please tell me.
[80:29.10]I would never forgive myself if anything bad happened to him.
[80:32.51]During our conversation, my health monitor did not detect any trauma.
[80:37.44]As yet.
[80:38.62]Okay.
[80:39.38]Okay.
[80:40.50]I admit.
[80:42.14]It was me who jacked the SU-X.
[80:44.56]But he didn't leave me any choice.
[80:46.62]Who is he?
[80:48.40]I can't tell you.
[80:49.72]If he knew I gave him away, he'd take revenge on Ben.
[80:53.31]Look out!
[80:54.19]It must be those thugs!
[80:55.47]We're dead!
[80:56.63]No one's gonna save us!
[80:58.53]If they are criminals, then they are the ones who need saving.
[81:02.34]Ooh, that's a Robocop line.
[81:04.73]I got it.
[81:05.15]Don't worry.
[81:05.55]I will throw a television at his face.
[81:10.85]Scott.
[81:35.90]Is this the man that was causing you distress, Scott?
[81:51.43]I tried to gently place him onto the chair.
[82:07.11]There's so many of them.
[82:10.91]Scott, Scott, there's like three of them.
[82:14.35]Scott.
[82:31.06]You did it.
[82:31.87]Dude folded like an egg.
[82:34.43]Maybe you can put an end to this after all.
[82:37.19]I am missing vital information in order to resolve this case.
[82:41.36]I'll tell you what you want.
[82:43.20]Just please, help me fix this screw up.
[82:46.40]Where is the car now?
[82:48.92]Oh man, I'm sure it's still in their chop shop.
[82:51.92]It's a warehouse on the northeast side.
[82:54.20]The entrance is concealed, but I'm sure you'll find it.
[82:57.76]I'm no fighter, but if there is any other way, I would like to help.
[83:02.60]Maybe you need some more intel.
[83:06.20]Hmm.
[83:08.10]Who is responsible?
[83:11.18]Rex from the local gang.
[83:13.35]Okay.
[83:13.63]Oops.
[83:13.75]You got slashed with a knife?
[83:14.91]What?
[83:29.05]You saw those thugs?
[83:29.87]Huge raids?
[83:30.23]We got some raids?
[83:31.81]Oh shit, do we get a big raid?
[83:33.17]We got a triple raid?
[83:33.71]Holy shit.
[83:33.95]I don't even have anything to see who it was.
[83:35.11]Who raided?
[83:35.95]I missed it.
[83:36.41]Thank you, appreciate it.
[84:01.72]Okay.
[84:01.88]That is all for now.
[84:03.75]Proceeding to the vehicle's estimated location.
[84:07.35]You are calling for backup, aren't you?
[84:09.73]Negative.
[84:10.51]Flex calculation minimal.
[84:14.59]Okay.
[84:14.91]I got to tell you.
[84:17.28]You know those charts that say... Okay.
[84:20.98]So, like, two of these are protecting you and the rest are coming after you.
[84:25.92]Who are you picking to defend you?
[84:29.01]If Robocop is on that list, he's being picked.
[84:30.99]I don't care if Superman is on the list.
[84:35.41]I feel like Robocop would be completely ride or die with you.
[84:45.78]Robocop does not win over Goku.
[84:48.08]That doesn't matter.
[84:53.86]Three Grizzly Bears and Robocop.
[84:55.64]That actually would probably be pretty good for me.
[84:59.14]What about Robocop over the Terminator?
[85:04.38]I don't know.
[85:04.82]Robocop.
[85:05.28]I think Robocop's a little more loyal.
[85:08.70]Terminator originally was out to fucking get me.
[85:10.82]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[85:12.22]Get fucking in line with the assholes coming after me.
[85:23.87]I pick my team on principle, not on power, okay?
[85:26.95]Excuse me.
[85:34.97]citizen I'm ordering you to discontinue this deliberate act of vandalism screw you man get back here oh he's still too slow wait this would be so scary it's like Michael myers coming after you
[86:06.36]Oh, I see somebody is in the dumpster.
[86:24.48]So what you gonna do?
[86:26.60]You can't put me behind bars.
[86:28.16]I'm still a kid and only done it once.
[86:30.72]Just let me off with a warning, will ya?
[86:37.82]You know what?
[86:45.73]This is your last warning.
[86:47.61]Clean it up.
[86:48.03]But hold on a minute.
[86:49.61]It could be pretty sick looking.
[86:52.63]Let me check and see how sick it looks.
[86:54.36]Depending on its sickness...
[87:12.13]hmm lettering is beautiful coloring in the lines choice of words a little a little bad I would use sucks or kuzak my ass you're getting a ticket what are you doing
[88:17.22]Alright, here we go.
[88:18.96]It's the chop shop.
[88:22.78]The lighting is really pretty.
[88:23.90]Is this Unreal 5?
[88:25.83]Looks really cool.
[88:36.76]Okay, I said the game wasn't running, but with that Nvidia shit turned on, this actually runs.
[88:40.60]This is running really nicely.
[88:43.43]Even with streaming it too.
[88:44.53]Usually you got to turn everything down.
[88:46.39]Am I, am I just, did I just absolutely wake up to putting that on in every single game that I own?
[88:54.00]How did you go through a wall?
[88:55.44]What?
[88:59.08]The LSS is magical.
[89:00.66]That's, this is crazy.
[89:01.48]This is like a hundred, this is like running at full 60 to 120.
[89:03.98]Is there a secret door?
[89:13.54]Find a way in.
[89:14.20]I can't, can I attack?
[89:22.91]I can't attack her.
[89:23.57]Oh, hold on.
[89:28.81]Secret button.
[89:30.27]Oh!
[89:42.52]Oh my god!
[89:43.08]That guy... Oh, that guy got destroyed!
[89:47.46]Oh!
[89:48.56]This game's gonna give me a headache.
[89:51.26]I already know I'm gonna get a headache from this.
[89:55.55]It's fake synthetic frames.
[89:57.15]Hey, well, it... Look, I can't tell the difference.
[90:01.45]My, like, pea brain can't tell the difference, so I'm... Oh, whatever.
[90:19.89]oh this car's gonna explode is it okay they all have they all have what you're gonna destroy your shop stop who is who is like dropping bombs on us
[90:49.17]Stop throwing grenades everywhere.
[90:51.21]There's too many explosions.
[90:56.49]Why would you throw a grenade in here?
[91:00.01]Guys, stop with this.
[91:05.43]Wait.
[91:06.85]What'd I get?
[91:07.32]Ooh, nice.
[91:14.28]You motherfucker.
[91:15.66]How do I...
[91:27.87]I'm coming at you with a gas can!
[91:29.55]I'm coming at you with a gas can!
[91:31.04]I'm coming at you... Rats.
[91:43.36]Eliminated.
[91:48.25]You... eat anything?
[91:53.47]Hey!
[91:54.67]What?
[91:57.61]Hey!
[91:58.59]Oh, I'm bumping into... Okay, I was like, who's shooting me?
[92:04.23]Who's left?
[92:26.95]Documents.
[92:32.52]Okay, I think I got everything.
[92:34.06]I killed every threat.
[92:35.63]Up there?
[92:35.95]Oh shit, I hope that's not... Is that her car?
[92:54.90]Her car's the blue one?
[93:07.51]Open the safe.
[93:09.01]I need level six engineering.
[93:10.64]Oh, fuck you.
[93:19.86]Vitality level two required to recharge.
[93:22.26]I have to, I don't, I'm not good enough.
[93:25.34]I can get that open.
[93:26.12]Are you serious?
[93:31.17]Engineering level six?
[93:36.11]What is in there?
[94:01.41]Got it.
[94:04.25]Vehicle secured.
[94:11.97]No, that thing is way better.
[94:13.36]Why would I switch that out?
[94:17.42]There's so many bombs in here.
[94:23.34]Every fight is just going to be like...
[94:33.78]You think if you've gotten that many firefights as like a gang or a group of thugs or whatever you are, I don't think you would want to have like 15 propane tanks lying around and give every single person in your group 10 grenades and have gas can- I just feel like you would probably put those- you would store those somewhere.
[95:00.11]Yeah, no, I don't think so.
[95:00.99]Hmm... Hmm...
[95:27.17]Okay.
[95:28.69]You can retrieve the car, but you must write out a coupon book of 30 free car washes to be redeemed at any time by the victim.
[95:39.58]Proceeding to secure the perimeter, keys are in the ignition.
[95:43.92]Thank you so much!
[95:45.20]I promise I won't mess this up!
[95:46.96]If you do not do it at any moment that you are presented, you are going to jail.
[95:50.64]Cool.
[96:02.95]I just went back in the chop shop.
[96:07.87]Are they back in operation?
[96:08.97]Okay, that'd be really funny if they were just here again.
[96:16.34]I'd just come back in to add insult to injury and just shoot everybody.
[96:21.84]No, okay.
[96:22.68]I was wondering, are they... Their bodies are all cleaned up now.
[96:26.20]Alright, let's get out of here.
[96:44.19]Alright, cool.
[96:46.07]So I guess you kind of can go do some stuff and little side missions and everything.
[96:51.04]I thought I didn't think this game was going to be like this.
[96:54.10]I'm actually kind of glad it is.
[96:58.82]This is fun.
[96:59.46]I like this.
[97:02.72]I'm glad I'm playing it.
[97:03.92]Oh, can we go into the laundromat?
[97:12.92]Ouch.
[97:15.26]Everything okay?
[97:15.84]Do you need help with anything?
[97:21.55]What's this?
[97:24.61]If I catch any of you dopeheads washing jelly beans or marbles just for kicks, I'll make you pay for the parts you wreck.
[97:35.91]You washing anything in here?
[97:47.19]Dad, what does eviction mean?
[97:50.11]And who's a debt collector?
[97:52.44]Why can't I open the door for him?
[97:54.88]Dad, tell me the truth.
[97:56.09]Are we poor?
[97:57.62]Dad?
[97:58.42]Dad?
[97:59.54]Tired of your kids asking annoying questions?
[98:02.74]You just want to relax after a long day of work, but someone won't let you?
[98:06.74]Jesus.
[98:07.50]Are we going to be okay?
[98:09.59]Dad, I'm scared.
[98:11.43]Snoozers.
[98:12.69]Sleeping pills for kids.
[98:15.25]Just one pill can guarantee five hours of peace.
[98:18.71]Nap time just became your decision.
[98:22.39]Sleep tight, son.
[98:26.69]Why would you say it like that?
[98:28.01]Why would you say it like that?
[98:35.55]What a fucking maniac.
[98:39.29]Good day.
[98:45.92]Oh.
[98:47.72]What is the cat's name?
[98:51.22]Oh.
[98:52.82]Scrumptious?
[98:55.26]Scrumptious is a good cat name.
[99:08.52]Okay.
[99:10.59]There might be stuff I can do in here.
[99:20.39]Warning, issue a ticket for being too cute.
[99:30.10]What?
[99:31.24]Someone knocked out his teeth, including the gold one.
[99:34.18]He's asking if anyone found it.
[99:37.30]For gold tooth.
[99:42.81]For some to learn how not to lose the track of time is to learn how not to lose their money.
[99:50.73]I gotta find this tooth.
[100:02.20]You're a ticket cuff.
[100:05.02]It's experience points.
[100:11.15]Hey, hey.
[100:12.53]What's going on over here?
[100:13.65]OK.
[100:13.81]It's you again.
[100:51.39]Rowboat.
[100:51.61]Rowboat.
[100:52.05]I can't even say it.
[100:53.19]Alright, let's go into the arcade.
[101:22.73]Oh, he's like a piece of shit.
[101:23.93]But being a piece of shit is not illegal.
[101:51.85]Hmm.
[102:22.00]Oh, look.
[102:22.88]Oh, look what's going on back there.
[102:36.73]Cool.
[102:37.33]Whoa, can I play these?
[102:39.19]Please tell me I can play at least one of these.
[102:40.59]This is so cool.
[102:41.83]Come on.
[102:44.13]What is this guy?
[102:44.55]What are you doing?
[102:47.67]Slouching detected.
[102:54.89]I'm being a little judgmental about your slouching.
[102:57.89]I'm not going to arrest somebody for slouching.
[103:02.51]Have you witnessed the owner participating in any criminal activity?
[103:11.34]Are you kidding me?
[103:12.74]Half the things I've seen around here would be enough to put him behind bars for a decade.
[103:17.34]Let us hear your statement.
[103:19.69]No way, dude.
[103:20.97]He might be a douchebag, but if you lock him up, this place will get closed down, and where am I supposed to play hooky then?
[103:27.63]What if I purchase the establishment, and then make all the games free?
[103:35.87]You lack discipline.
[103:36.77]Looks like someone should give you a slap on the wrist.
[103:40.63]Yeah, but you wouldn't do it.
[103:42.67]I know you.
[103:43.75]You don't hurt kids.
[103:58.97]What are you doing wrong?
[104:02.59]Bloodshot eyes caused by sleep deprivation.
[104:04.75]Irrelevant to the case.
[104:05.65]Alright, coming up on a break.
[104:13.82]I need a warrant.
[104:18.06]You can use Robocop vision to investigate objects or people to find clues.
[104:21.70]Yeah, OK.
[104:26.40]You can have something behind the counter, right?
[104:31.57]Puke?
[104:34.76]Expelled gastric content, irrelevant.
[104:41.68]Does Robocop use the bathroom?
[104:46.95]That's a good question.

[106:00.29]I'm definitely getting more of this stuff.
[106:02.69]Who sold you drugs?
[106:04.89]I really shouldn't say.
[106:07.27]You are my TV heroes.
[106:09.61]Alright.
[106:11.47]All of the arcade staff will sell to you.
[106:15.32]As long as you got cash.
[106:17.06]Unfortunately, I'm broke.
[106:19.08]But I have a great idea.
[106:20.84]You could help me sneak into the basement.
[106:24.64]They keep a huge stash of goodies down there.
[106:28.17]Alright, let's get this break out of the way after this.
[106:34.31]And then I'll be back.
[106:34.89]This is not going to be my last break.
[106:36.59]I'm here for at least another couple hours.
[106:41.17]I got the search warrant, though.
[106:42.86]I'm ready to go fucking kick the door down.
[106:54.28]Yeah, it's 9 o'clock.
[106:58.87]How's it going to start?
[106:59.58]I'll be right back.
[107:28.69]I just, I caught this.
[107:29.47]Somebody said it's because Holly's not home.
[107:35.49]That's so funny because Holly's been back for like a month.
[107:39.43]It's like, ah, yeah, yeah.
[107:50.76]Holly's out of the house.
[107:51.64]It's been like two and a half months.
[107:53.32]Alright.
[107:57.17]BRB.
[110:59.88]I'm not quite back yet, but I just freaked out.
[111:02.46]I thought I was unmuted because I... Hold on.
[111:06.33]Give me a second.
[111:06.75]I'll tell the story in a second.
[111:22.17]Okay, I can hear Holly laughing because she's in the other room.
[111:26.75]And I did.
[111:28.37]Okay.
[111:29.99]So the mic was muted.
[111:31.92]I was ready to come back.
[111:32.66]And I'm making another little light coffee.
[111:35.88]And I just ripped a massive fucking big one.
[111:40.16]And I look over in the chat and I see Roboshart.
[111:45.14]And I was like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[111:48.62]And I was like, wait, it was cause it was, it was two or three seconds after I did it.
[111:52.20]And I'm like, no way.
[111:54.80]And then I hear her laugh because she also, she heard it and she, I can hear her laughing now.
[112:04.88]It's like, why would you say that?
[112:07.06]Unless it was because of what I just did.
[112:12.45]My goodness.
[112:13.13]Alright, let's go.
[112:20.56]No, I'm telling you, go back and look.
[112:21.84]If you go back and look at the VOD, you'll see.
[112:23.48]Somebody literally said Roboshart right before I sat back down.
[112:28.56]And the... She just got the ick.

[117:37.37]True Torchheads are fearless fighters, never afraid to face the enemy.

[118:33.30]This guy didn't even care.
[118:34.13]Even if I wanted to help you, I can't.
[118:36.81]Only his closest people know his whereabouts.
[118:39.97]I just distribute his stuff.
[118:42.01]To be completely honest, I don't want or need to know more than when the next shipment is coming.
[118:47.43]You must know the location they mentioned.
[118:49.89]Tell me where they took the police informant.
[118:52.53]and if I tell you he tripped over and died okay if you if I tell you a short no no no I'm sorry you're selling drugs to kids you're going to wave forever I'm sorry interrogation sequence initiated you can't do it I'm a respectable citizen and I have complex health conditions okay fine I'll talk

[119:59.45]This sucks.
[120:00.15]I want to like get in there.
[120:05.61]Invoice?
[120:07.97]$62 desk button.
[120:10.20]Armored gate.
[120:12.46]You get a button on your desk?
[120:15.22]Where is it?
[120:21.45]Oh.
[120:27.22]What do we have here?
[120:33.85]What opened?
[120:34.47]I don't even know what I just did.
[120:41.86]Deduction level two required.
[120:43.56]I can't do this math?
[120:46.95]Oh no, I am an incredibly advanced supercomputer.
[120:49.45]But six times seventy-nine times five seventy-three times six times eight times sixteen to the seventh power forty-seven times seventy-two, I can't do this shit.
[121:00.42]No, absolutely not.
[121:03.50]Oh, I can't.
[121:05.16]What did I just open?
[121:08.10]Bro, calculators from like the 40s could do... Were calculators invented in the 40s?
[121:14.37]What year was the calculator invented?
[121:15.71]Okay, I just opened up something.
[121:17.73]What did I open?
[121:24.69]It said secret.
[121:25.32]I heard like a... What was it?
[121:31.88]It was like 2,000 years ago.
[121:33.44]It was the safe that opened?
[121:36.59]No, I opened up something.
[121:49.98]Cables go over there.
[121:51.06]Wait, hold on.
[121:54.12]Oh, hold on.
[121:56.94]Hold on.
[122:03.00]Oh, yeah.
[122:05.69]Dude.
[122:08.09]This is stolen handbag, stolen jewelry.
[122:10.95]I'm going to be able to level up.
[122:29.36]Okay, I can't do it.
[122:33.04]Alright, let's get out of here.
[122:33.98]Cool.
[122:38.05]Any more stuff?
[122:40.27]Yep.
[122:44.11]I gotta get more of this, because that's how you get points.
[122:48.64]Ow.
[123:06.95]Wait, any other stuff?
[123:08.85]Yeah.
[123:13.09]I got some points to put in.
[123:15.27]We go in psychology four.
[123:21.01]Highlights favorable dialog.
[123:22.65]I feel like I'm going to start to lose if I do psychology four.
[123:29.48]I want engineering.
[123:30.22]I want to open up chests and stuff.
[123:34.73]Yeah, I want to be able to do this.
[123:36.99]Now I have a dash.
[123:38.55]I can ram people.
[123:43.53]Now safecracking is up there.
[123:45.75]Alright.
[123:50.41]Oof.
[123:54.30]Do they explode if I crash into them?
[124:00.42]Psychology sounds lame as fuck.
[124:02.34]You should ignore it entirely.
[124:10.91]I think that's part of the fun though.
[124:14.31]Hey, I got two good outcomes by having the two points in it already.
[124:30.75]The safe code was only +2 deduction.
[124:41.13]Got him.
[124:44.63]Locate the ghost house.
[124:51.67]That hand... What was that hand motion?
[125:12.69]He's still here.
[125:13.29]Oh, there you are!
[125:27.93]I have to be, okay, I need to be honest.
[125:30.91]I gotta be very honest.
[125:33.22]This is the first video game that I've ever played on this computer with whatever settings, doesn't matter what they are, activated, where I actually have this enabled and my computer is not turning into fucking porridge.
[125:51.33]This has never happened before.
[125:53.41]I turned this shit all off because it sucks and never works.
[125:57.55]This is the first time it's ever worked and I'm streaming it and hooking it through a stream.
[126:01.26]That's actually unheard of.
[126:04.94]I am sold on whatever this fucking technology you're telling me is.
[126:24.27]What the hell is that?
[126:30.53]It's heavily native resolution dependent.
[126:34.80]Yeah, well, whatever it is, I've... A ton of other games that have had tons of high graphics and lighting and reflections and bloom and... Chlorine eyes.
[126:46.63]They always run like shit.
[126:47.65]Like complete shit.
[126:56.21]Alright, here we go.
[127:00.81]You're an Nvidia shill?
[127:01.97]I forgot I had an Nvidia card in the computer until you just said that.
[127:20.67]You need to be taught some manners.
[127:27.90]Damn it.
[127:28.40]How did I miss the TV?
[127:29.88]They put a perfect... Oh my goodness.
[127:41.40]It's too many people coming.
[127:42.76]Oh.
[127:57.89]Let's get the SMG.
[128:01.53]What the fuck?
[128:03.13]You got a mini gun?
[128:04.27]Got him.
[128:12.74]Oh my god.
[128:16.66]I need health.
[128:21.11]Oh no, no, no.
[128:26.07]Where are you?
[128:30.27]I was trying to... We're good
[128:58.15]I don't know what's going on with that guy in that room, but it was weird.
[129:02.85]Any health?
[129:17.79]No healing?
[129:18.43]Come on.
[129:20.75]No way.
[129:43.94]Grenade again.
[129:44.86]This feels really out of place in Robocop's hands.
[129:55.09]Yeah, it's funny to have this.
[130:00.91]Oh, this is blood.
[130:01.93]This is the guys.
[130:02.61]Oh, I was wondering what is all this.
[130:08.80]Oh my God, this is disgusting.
[130:10.80]I'm just looking for health.
[130:17.30]He's like his brain is trapped in like a time portal.
[130:31.18]Throw two grenades.
[130:32.68]Dude, stop throwing the grenades.
[130:43.27]I'll give you a grenade.
[130:44.55]Fuck you.
[130:45.13]Okay.
[130:55.28]Okay.
[130:58.08]Now let's eat like a civilized family.
[131:01.97]Dude, look at that.
[131:17.99]I think that's his brain spinning around.
[131:25.10]That's somebody's brain.
[131:41.86]There's so many bugs.
[131:45.24]Nice ricochet into the head.
[131:46.94]Let me tell you, to all you game developers out there, I need to tell you.
[131:59.79]If you let gamers, players, whatever, pick up stuff and throw it at people.
[132:07.11]I don't know how long it takes to code that.
[132:10.43]But it just makes your game like half a letter grade more fun.
[132:14.55]It just does.
[132:17.42]Fake ID.
[132:18.18]I'm going to get him on the fake ID.
[132:58.43]That it?
[132:59.85]Can I open this chest?
[133:01.91]Level six engineering.
[133:02.93]No, I did what I do deductions.
[133:17.48]Where?
[133:19.98]Where?
[133:20.20]Where is he?
[133:24.40]Where?
[133:24.62]Is he on the couch?
[133:25.40]Where is he?
[133:29.41]You up?
[133:37.07]Robocop doesn't take fall damage.
[133:39.14]Hold on.
[133:47.00]I'm looking for a heal.
[133:58.23]I'll kill him when I get up there.
[134:00.29]Let's go.
[134:08.23]That chair can't be picked up.
[134:23.92]Oh, I can't do that.
[134:37.38]I'm almost dead.
[134:38.38]I gotta play very good here.
[134:39.42]Always just let them kill each other.
[134:46.75]Throwing.
[134:54.90]Shit.
[134:57.82]OK, I gotta play safer than that.
[135:10.18]Got ya.
[135:12.00]Ugh!
[135:12.78]Come on, dust!
[135:38.77]Hey, hey.
[135:42.63]The dude is on a machine.
[135:43.59]How did he miss me?
[135:44.45]That guy was awful.
[135:52.78]Fuck you with this shit, dude.
[135:58.44]You're gonna kill me.
[136:01.80]No, no, no, no, no, no, wait.
[136:05.60]No, no, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[136:07.26]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[136:09.26]No, don't.
[136:10.44]Hold on.
[136:10.74]Wait, wait, wait.
[136:11.26]Don't, don't.
[136:11.58]Please.
[136:12.86]Don't.
[136:14.52]I... Oh.
[136:20.42]Okay.
[136:23.58]We're good.
[136:30.76]Give me this.
[136:33.16]Oh, I'm breaching that door.
[136:34.34]This thing is going to just...
[136:46.64]Are you the police informant?
[136:48.62]Do you know where I can find soot?
[136:52.36]Oh man, all great questions, but could you untie me first?
[136:57.73]They really outdid themselves with these knots.
[137:03.27]Talk.
[137:05.06]I don't know how you usually operate, but that type of information don't come free.
[137:13.32]It's your civic duty.
[137:14.86]What is your freedom worth to you?
[137:16.85]I do not work for free either.
[137:20.41]Am I telling him to pay me?
[137:21.81]Then my service is free.
[137:25.79]No, of course not.
[137:28.51]You're right.
[137:29.41]Oh, I got him.
[137:29.90]I saved my skin.
[137:31.90]So, it seems that the new guy saw the punks attack on the TV station and decided to meet with Soot on their turf.
[137:40.38]I gotta turn the vocals up a little, I think.
[137:43.27]Alright, nice.
[137:45.79]I'm gonna turn the vocals up a little.
[137:46.99]Everything else seems pretty good.
[138:10.01]Such as meeting the new guy tonight at the old slaughterhouse.
[138:13.79]Copy that.
[138:14.59]Pick me up at the station.
[138:15.63]I'll grab my gear.
[138:17.15]By the way, I've got something for you, Murphy.
[138:19.79]There's nothing in here.
[138:20.61]They call me Pickles.
[138:22.69]And you guessed it.
[138:23.51]There's a funny story behind that name.
[138:26.01]It's one time.
[138:26.87]There's nothing in there.
[138:27.59]I saw Torchhead stealing a delivery truck.
[138:29.97]I went after them, hoping that a VCR would fall off the back of the truck, you know?
[138:34.89]Yeah.
[138:35.13]But it turned out to be groceries.
[138:37.73]Uh-huh.
[138:38.19]So they left it.
[138:41.16]Right.
[138:41.48]Yep.
[138:41.78]Really?
[138:42.80]The hell?
[138:43.28]Where'd he go?
[139:10.71]How did I lose him?
[139:11.93]Where did he go?
[139:12.53]Oh.
[139:15.63]Right.
[139:21.26]This way, citizen.
[139:22.98]Please follow me.
[139:59.95]Are we gonna get ambushed?
[140:10.36]You go first.
[140:11.01]I'm not... I don't want to get hit.
[140:11.99]I only have like 20 health.
[140:29.37]Thoughts on exquisite fine dining?
[140:31.55]Nah.
[140:31.83]Hmm.
[140:31.95]Is Briggs in trouble?
[141:01.96]Last time I saw him, he was going to check a case of missing bodies.
[141:05.82]Sounded like a bogus lead, so I didn't press him.
[141:11.20]He had two Big Macs and an Oreo McFlurry.
[141:13.89]Sounds pretty great.
[141:17.25]Two Big Macs and a McFlurry?
[141:23.31]How do you know Officer Briggs?
[141:26.53]We go back a long way.
[141:28.85]He gave me a helping hand when I hit rock bottom.
[141:31.69]And I've been in his debt ever since.
[141:34.43]He even introduced me to his family.
[141:36.48]Too big Max's madness.
[141:39.34]No.
[141:43.12]No, actually, no, I think that's alright.
[141:44.88]You know how many times I've ordered two or three sandwiches and gone?
[141:49.12]I don't know about this.
[141:49.80]And you get through the first one.
[141:50.66]You go, yeah.
[141:51.40]Oh, yeah, I do.
[141:55.93]Need to go.
[141:57.77]Duty awaits a lot of bread though it is about that.
[142:01.19]I've got a favor to ask 2025 Big Mac ain't shit.
[142:04.29]I actually haven't had a Big Mac to him since 2023 or 2024.
[142:09.03]It's been like a year and it's kind of weighing me down.
[142:14.03]What is it?
[142:15.57]It's his wristwatch.
[142:17.41]Now I feel bad holding on to it.
[142:20.83]They shrunk him.
[142:21.67]Please give it back to his family.
[142:24.22]This is stolen property and you expect me to return it.
[142:27.90]That sounds bad when you say it like that, but still you shouldn't let me.
[142:35.02]Why is he framed so poorly?
[142:36.76]He kind of isn't like the lower right corner of the screen.
[142:38.71]You're right in the first place.
[142:40.71]I will make sure they receive it from the repentant thief.
[142:45.35]Boy, you're a tough negotiator.
[142:48.73]But surely you mean now I gotta chillax after all this.
[142:53.25]You know, people saying they're just regular Macs now.
[142:57.35]I would.
[142:59.75]I think they should come out with regular Mac.
[143:03.21]Just have it be the just one patty and just put some of the sauce on it and do the sesame seed bun.
[143:09.23]I feel like that would go pretty awesome.
[143:16.30]Uh, OK, I want to chillax.
[143:18.22]No, we're going now.
[143:19.10]Proceed with haste.
[143:22.98]As you command, Officer Steely.
[143:26.39]Doing this now.
[143:29.43]I'm doing it later over here.
[143:31.89]This is where Briggs lives.
[143:33.83]OK, let's go over with his watch is burning a hole in my pocket.
[143:50.53]Apartment 21.
[143:51.21]Oh man, my hands are sweaty.
[143:56.31]Are you going into a drug-related withdrawal?
[143:59.09]Do you require medical assistance?
[144:02.13]What?
[144:03.07]No, I'm just nervous.
[144:04.43]Me and Gail have a complicated relationship.
[144:08.59]She's good at reading people.
[144:10.61]And I'm the type of person that doesn't like to be read.
[144:12.81]As long as there are chairs in the apartment, I'll be fine.
[144:17.31]Like steal a watch.
[144:19.61]Well, you know where, you know where she lives, not me.
[144:27.95]Why are you waiting for me?
[144:29.93]I don't know where to go.
[144:45.86]That's a fucked up knock.
[144:51.08]Are you here about Mike?
[144:53.29]Yes, I'm sorry to hear about your husband.
[144:56.17]21?
[144:57.37]Oh, shit.
[145:06.07]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[145:07.17]This junkie is not coming inside.
[145:08.91]What else are you going to steal?
[145:11.87]Funny you should say that.
[145:17.21]Let's find out, let's deduce it.
[145:19.53]Hmm...
[145:43.09]Why do you think that Pickles is involved in your husband's disappearance?
[145:46.40]Hearing Robocop say that just sounds weird.
[145:49.64]Sometimes too good for his own sake.
[145:51.30]He said it so goofily too.
[145:52.62]He's like, why do you think that Pickles... Even if someone doesn't deserve him.
[145:58.13]Like Pickles...
[146:00.54]Okay.
[146:16.36]I heard that he was looking into reports of bodies going missing.
[146:20.48]An old lady approached him at the precinct and told him a sob story about how she couldn't afford to bury her husband.
[146:28.63]Can you believe that?
[146:30.47]Anyway, when she finally collected enough money and went back to the morgue only to find that they had lost her husband's body.
[146:38.81]Mike went to check it.
[146:39.71]Her eyelids aren't moving.
[146:40.91]She blinks.
[146:41.45]It's just her lashes.
[146:43.19]Wait.
[146:49.51]whoa that is happening that is crazy I think I have everything I need I love this game this game is great on the case makes me a little less anxious hey honestly like did I actually get this game for three dollars does that happen he does not know
[147:11.83]I was in a fugue state?
[147:12.35]Does anyone remember?
[147:13.42]Was this game... I swear this was on sale during the latest Steam sale for like a few dollars.
[147:18.58]It was $3.99.
[147:43.01]Was 10 bucks.
[147:43.85]It was $4.
[147:45.07]I can't believe I got this game for $4.
[147:46.85]No way.
[147:55.46]It was.
[147:56.66]This was four bucks.
[147:58.50]No fucking way.
[148:00.04]I like can't believe that.
[148:09.53]It wasn't.
[148:10.73]What is it right now?
[148:13.70]It was 8 before?
[148:19.28]Tons of people hated this?
[148:32.55]Check SteamDB.
[148:34.09]Lowest price was $7.79.
[148:34.85]It was $70 at launch?
[148:35.51]Oh, I see.
[148:35.77]Yeah.
[148:48.10]You know, I will say though, I've played some real dog shit that was 60 to 70 plus dollars at launch.
[148:54.96]It wasn't 70?
[148:55.30]It was 50 at launch.
[148:57.00]It was 50?
[148:58.04]Well, it depends on regions too, right?
[149:00.08]It could have been more expensive.
[149:20.49]Cheaper than normal.
[149:21.33]It was like 50.
[149:21.95]50 at launch.
[149:24.09]What?
[149:24.25]49?
[149:24.47]Yeah, I mean... I've played shittier games for 60 bucks.
[149:32.64]I have to say.
[149:35.84]We must get to the basketball court.
[149:38.60]That's just around the corner.
[149:41.32]Are we playing...
[149:42.70]What's that got to do with time?
[149:44.32]Is it like time to kick my ass?
[149:47.54]We are going to remind Gale's son that it is past curfew.
[149:52.60]Why are your stream titles so psychotic?
[149:54.35]What is this?
[149:54.79]What is it?
[149:56.41]What's the title right now?
[150:02.55]Rage Quit Sunday.
[150:03.45]I keep it together.
[150:04.35]Oh, fuck.
[150:05.99]This should be something else now.
[150:10.23]This should not be the title right now.
[150:14.00]It doesn't matter, whatever.
[150:16.18]It's been like that for six hours, doesn't matter.
[150:18.98]It still says Jump King.
[150:20.50]No, it's RoboCop.
[150:24.22]Can we actually get to play basketball?
[150:32.96]Can we play?
[150:33.92]This guy's giving me the Kubrick stare.
[150:46.40]Good evening, citizens.
[150:47.82]I need... Need what?
[150:49.48]Some spare parts?
[150:51.15]Hey, there's a mechanic up the road.
[150:56.75]You are not the only ankle breaker on this basketball court.
[151:00.11]Man, that's letting you off easy.
[151:01.70]I've seen him do way worse for less.
[151:04.08]Shit, I was just messing with you.
[151:06.52]What do you need?
[151:08.13]We're looking for a kid.
[151:09.63]His name's Daniel.
[151:11.22]He was playing here earlier.
[151:13.10]Why?
[151:13.98]Is it past his bedtime?
[151:16.12]It is.
[151:17.66]Yeah, I saw a couple of kids drawing with chalk they found lying around that crime scene over there.
[151:22.50]Thank you for the information.
[151:25.16]Congrats, guys.
[151:26.64]You just became police informants.
[151:29.26]It has its perks.
[151:30.81]You'll love it.
[151:34.07]I see a couple of drawings over there.
[151:37.97]That doesn't investigate.
[151:40.73]Hell.
[151:41.25]Can I get, like, a Slurpee?
[151:43.86]Hmm.
[152:15.46]Is this ray tracing or emulated?
[152:17.23]I don't know.
[152:18.81]It just looks pretty... Huh?
[152:20.95]What the hell did he do?
[152:45.79]What kind of cartoon shit was he doing?
[152:51.88]Why do you step this many times?
[153:01.30]Is it just to throw off the law?
[153:03.58]I feel like that's what you do, right?
[153:05.64]Step in the... Hey, you're stepping in it.
[153:07.44]You're gonna compromise the crime scene.
[153:16.02]Is it just in here?
[153:19.42]What about over there?
[153:21.08]Metal garage door locked.
[153:22.75]They did not go inside.
[153:24.25]Scooby Doo chasing.
[153:29.61]Yeah.
[153:35.79]So I guess you have like a scanning thing in your eyes.
[153:39.77]Yes, it allows me to see things that are not there anymore.
[153:44.48]That's where they went.
[153:46.16]Hey.
[153:49.02]Hey, bros.
[153:50.91]That's where they went.
[153:51.59]Wait.
[153:51.73]Can I grab this?
[153:52.17]Ladder unreachable by teens.
[153:53.39]Okay, well.
[154:22.15]So why couldn't I have done that to the door?
[154:25.43]What the fuck?
[154:27.25]What?
[154:27.53]That's that's how I say it.
[154:28.91]We better hurry.
[154:41.52]Do it, come on.
[154:43.36]Oh, that's not good.
[154:44.06]What are you waiting for?
[154:45.48]Fuck him up.
[154:46.36]He's laughing at you.
[154:49.08]Hey, what the hell's going on over there?
[154:53.94]Easy with that.
[154:55.40]Oh shit.
[154:59.20]Is that a gun?
[155:01.16]You're in so much trouble, kid.
[155:03.54]No, it's not.
[155:05.58]Whoa!
[155:12.04]What the hell?
[155:13.65]You're lucky that tin man here doesn't have a real heart.
[155:17.01]He'd have a hole in it right about now.
[155:19.87]sorry sir why'd you get scared I don't know he wants your dad jumpy my dad's missing so he can't tell me nothing my mom said that he's out on an assignment but I know the truth he's not coming back why'd you say that he's always been a stickler for following the rules I guess that's why he's missing cops can't shoot without giving a warning and someone got the drop on him
[155:49.34]But that's not going to happen to me.
[155:51.64]I'm going to be the one that shoots first.
[155:54.07]That's why my friends say... Your friends are knuckleheads.
[155:57.25]If you listen to them, you're a knucklehead too.
[156:02.43]Come on.
[156:03.87]Sit down.
[156:05.53]We need to talk.
[156:09.95]Damn.
[156:10.33]Those friends of yours, they take the easy way out.
[156:14.81]You don't want to go down that road.
[156:17.15]It leads to...
[156:18.81]He's like whispering right now.
[156:21.94]Do you know why your dad is such a stickler for the rules?
[156:26.32]Because he's a chump.
[156:28.08]Because it's the right thing to do.
[156:30.54]It's not always easy to do the right thing.
[156:33.62]It takes strength.
[156:36.86]And you think my dad has that kind of strength?
[156:40.04]Are you kidding me?
[156:41.05]I can turn the master volume up and then drop the everything.
[156:44.49]Drop the sound effects.
[156:45.13]Because anytime somebody throws a grenade, my whole room shakes.
[157:09.98]It was a cartoon with a Satanic dog named Pickles.
[157:14.20]What was that?
[157:14.84]Pickle, he's a good boy.
[157:20.54]Yeah, I remember that one.
[157:41.04]Right.
[157:42.56]It's late.
[157:43.76]Let's get you home.
[157:45.19]Will you tell my mom about the gun?
[157:47.69]No.
[157:48.65]She doesn't like me already.
[157:52.01]I will be telling her about the gun.
[157:55.89]Thanks for the help, Tin Man.
[157:58.09]I'll talk to you later.
[157:58.89]Isn't that kind of fucked up to say that?
[158:04.42]Isn't that incredibly fucking rude and offensive to say that to me?
[158:12.25]I had to take care of something.
[158:13.81]We can go there soon.
[158:14.81]Sure thing pick me up at the station when you're done.
[158:19.37]I gotta go.
[158:21.16]The old slaughterhouse dig any points.
[158:24.90]No points.
[158:27.42]Dude what?
[158:54.71]Delta City.
[159:03.16]The cat, is that cat?
[159:05.78]That's kind of weird.
[159:07.66]What is it?
[159:08.04]Oh, I thought, okay.
[159:09.06]I thought that with the tail was the other arm.
[159:13.15]I was sitting there thinking, what is going on now?
[159:15.25]I thought, he's gotta move like a chimpanzee.
[159:25.82]This game is... I like this game.
[159:27.82]It's just enough.
[159:30.87]Oh, wait.
[159:31.55]Side objectives.
[159:33.55]Did I do all the side stuff?
[159:35.57]I think I did, right?
[159:38.31]Serve and protect.
[159:38.99]Keep your beat in check for signs of law-breaking.
[159:45.50]I think I did pretty... I think I did enough.
[160:00.98]Four more violations.
[160:02.46]This is where Sook is supposedly hiding.
[160:06.34]Can't really call it hiding if he sent invitations to the whole city.
[160:09.32]I bet Rudy forgot about us.
[160:11.28]This is the major mission.
[160:13.33]At least I will not feel bad crashing his party.
[160:17.57]Murphy, I was thinking about what happened to you at the TV station.
[160:22.81]Maybe you shouldn't... This is one of the funniest things I've seen all month.
[160:26.63]...is keeping my circuits in check.
[160:29.45]Throwing the computer screen, almost hitting the hostage in the head.
[160:32.27]And then just throwing everybody out the window.
[160:35.07]That hurt.
[160:36.29]That hurt my stomach.
[160:37.03]I'm gonna shut up now.
[160:57.76]Just take this little something to remind you of what I've just said.
[161:01.16]Open it the next time Becker gets under your skin.
[161:07.06]Also, don't forget you have a partner who's counting on you.
[161:14.63]I feel like Robocop would answer the phone if I called him at like 2 o'clock in the morning for anything.
[161:18.82]Why don't you walk over here?
[161:44.04]Robo Butler?
[161:45.02]That'd be awesome to have Robocop as your personal butler and bodyguard.
[161:51.81]That'd be amazing.
[162:01.65]We cannot go this way.
[162:03.19]We would need a warrant.
[162:05.29]I can't believe those stupid directives are still holding you back.
[162:13.70]Damn, okay.
[162:14.48]Stolen stuff.
[162:17.95]Okay.
[162:41.59]Okay, there's a new king.
[162:42.81]It appears that we are facing the birth of a new drug empire.
[162:45.75]Okay.
[162:46.57]Hold on, there could be stuff.
[162:51.29]Hold on!
[163:19.15]Get ready for the grenades.
[163:22.33]Wait, I think I can hear something.
[163:25.89]Maybe your informer was right after all.
[163:28.57]Gherkin, was it?
[163:30.07]Pickles.
[163:31.35]That was a good one.
[163:38.15]Yes, I definitely hear some commotion on the other side.
[163:42.88]Let's have a look, shall we?
[163:48.90]Everybody throw bombs and grenades in every direction.
[163:52.55]Justice never sleeps.
[163:53.69]And let's
[164:22.75]He's freaking out.
[164:23.55]He was like, I don't know where to go.
[164:28.61]He's like, what do I do?
[164:29.39]What do I do?
[164:30.65]What?
[164:31.29]Come on.
[164:33.40]Eyes on the prize, dickhead.
[164:35.32]Affirmative.
[164:45.23]Multiple subjects were neutralized, but there are still active threats in the vicinity.
[164:49.49]Gang leader included.
[164:50.89]Requesting backup.
[164:58.38]Yeah, don't worry.
[164:58.90]You got it.
[165:00.10]Why didn't I just try the handle?
[165:35.65]There's too many explosions.
[165:37.19]There's too many explosions.
[165:40.01]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[165:41.37]Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide.
[165:44.59]Hey.
[165:56.57]You piece of shit.
[166:04.58]I got him.
[166:07.77]Okay.
[166:09.05]I think we're good.
[166:10.63]No?
[166:17.66]Alright.
[166:20.48]Hold on!
[166:21.32]Lewis!
[166:24.30]I'm on the free model!
[166:26.07]I need to run three minutes of ads.
[166:29.77]I know, I need to run three minutes of ads.
[166:31.19]I'm sorry, Lewis.
[166:36.87]I'll be right back.
[166:41.59]Uh, it's still not too late.
[166:43.37]We'll go for like another couple hours.
[166:53.74]Holy crap, Lewis.
[166:56.20]You didn't pay for Robocop Premium.
[166:58.30]No.
[167:00.58]Alright, beer beat.
[171:22.02]Welcome back.
[171:27.54]I forgot I still had some coffee.
[171:31.03]I think this is the last coffee, though.
[171:35.41]It's from like an hour ago.
[171:40.09]Did Chrono Trigger get shafted?
[171:42.41]Yeah, it did.
[171:44.80]But fear not.
[171:47.22]Because tomorrow...
[171:51.67]Oh, actually, maybe tomorrow.
[171:55.89]Ster and I need to get Dark Souls 3 set up.
[171:59.77]Because we're going to do that on Tuesday.
[172:04.72]So there might be a stream tomorrow night.
[172:08.64]But there will absolutely be some Dark Souls 3 with Ster.
[172:23.79]No.
[172:24.27]Hey, I love that game.
[172:25.47]I want to play it again.
[172:29.68]We'll see it again.
[172:30.20]Don't worry.
[172:32.18]And not like two weeks from now.
[172:33.52]I mean like a few days from now.
[172:38.90]Let's keep going with this.
[172:41.22]We'll see how I feel another hour.
[172:43.40]Maybe one more hour.
[172:45.84]Maybe two hours.
[172:48.84]I definitely don't want to go too too late.
[172:50.62]So let's like in one hour.
[172:51.68]Let's see how we do.
[172:52.84]See how we're feeling.
[172:55.71]See how I am feeling specifically, right?
[172:58.55]Alright.
[172:58.81]I'm in the middle of a firefight, so let's go.
[173:06.61]Make sure I got to get comfortable.
[173:07.77]What the hell?
[173:08.97]I'm not... This is not comfortable.
[173:18.16]And the tray of caviar that I have is not even... Ugh.
[173:23.62]I hate that.
[173:24.12]I would never eat that.
[173:34.95]I got three backflips.
[173:40.71]I think I've eaten caviar before.
[173:42.71]Is caviar the stuff they put on sushi?
[173:45.83]Technically?
[173:46.81]That's technically caviar, right?
[173:52.31]I've had it before.
[173:55.67]Roe?
[173:56.31]Is Roe not caviar?
[174:00.59]Where's my partner?
[174:07.47]It's different, it's from a different, it's a different fish's egg.
[174:12.63]Oh boy!
[174:17.57]You'll make a fine trophy!
[174:24.30]You're okay there, Murphy?
[174:25.60]Behind you.
[174:28.68]Damn.
[174:30.07]She doesn't even flinch.
[174:32.27]They're closing in on us.
[174:33.59]She's like playing a video game too.
[174:38.61]This is a co-op partner.
[174:39.71]We're both playing a video game.
[174:43.75]Why is it introducing a person?
[174:46.53]I'm invincible!
[174:52.58]He died.
[174:52.96]Okay.
[175:00.36]Now they carry the grenades with them.
[175:04.37]Watch out!
[175:24.64]She can take so much more punishment than I can.
[175:26.32]That guy doesn't even know he's part of the fight.
[175:40.90]She got him before I could even look.
[175:45.38]He said that in my headphones.
[175:47.34]In my head.
[175:50.06]He grabbed me from behind and screamed it in my ear.
[175:56.87]Uh-oh, I have 1% HP.
[176:01.29]Lewis!
[176:02.11]Lewis, please help.
[176:04.15]Lewis, I have no health.
[176:05.20]Get over here.
[176:17.42]I just regen.
[176:18.18]Nice.
[176:23.81]Oh, Lewis, please!
[176:25.31]Lewis!
[176:37.68]Let's give him a warm welcome!
[176:44.88]Alright, here comes the Kaboomer.
[176:49.93]I'm invincible!
[177:01.93]Oh my god, I suck!
[177:03.87]I suck so bad!
[177:05.13]And I can't even move!
[177:07.11]Take this and... Have you seen the new Looney Tunes movie yet?
[177:18.15]No, I have not.
[177:20.07]Finally some fun!
[177:27.73]I'm invincible!
[177:41.20]I stepped on a landmine.
[177:46.46]They are killing.
[177:47.20]I'm just going to let her kill everything.
[177:57.35]I'm getting experience for this.
[178:15.94]There we go.
[178:52.32]Remember guys, I'm the protagonist.
[178:54.36]He can only do it to me.
[178:55.46]There's no crouching, too.
[179:15.01]That's the... You know, I kind of like that.
[179:24.77]No hiding.
[179:26.13]Robocop cannot crouch.
[179:27.31]Nice job.
[179:38.58]Idiot.
[179:43.71]Oh, I think I got him.
[180:00.90]Need heals.
[180:07.35]Come on, give me a heal.
[180:08.01]Come on.
[180:16.15]What the fuck just happened?
[180:18.84]Why did it explode in my hands?
[180:19.90]Did somebody shoot it?
[180:21.50]Why am I sliding?
[180:22.98]Robocop just tripped.
[180:26.42]I just fell down.
[180:27.88]Who is this guy?
[180:28.86]There's got to be health somewhere, right?
[180:32.20]It's too bad I can't use these.
[180:50.09]Put this down.
[180:50.55]I want this health somewhere.
[180:54.99]Come on.
[180:55.27]Yeah, what's in there?
[181:04.27]Reduction level 2 required.
[181:06.03]I don't... I can't... I can't move this.
[181:08.78]I don't know how to move a box.
[181:11.50]What operating system am I?
[181:12.68]Is this a Windows 3.2?
[181:27.04]Psychology sucks.
[181:43.94]I guess I'll open this door.
[181:46.62]I need a warrant first.
[181:47.84]We've done like $70,000 worth of damage already.
[181:55.00]We need to get a warrant.
[182:01.08]Oh, look over here.
[182:01.86]I found, uh, a drug.
[182:03.86]Hear music.
[182:09.89]We're getting close.
[182:12.23]Ooh.
[182:13.25]Ooh!
[182:16.95]Ooh.
[182:17.77]I've got eyes on the stage.
[182:24.65]Looks like they haven't realized we're here yet.
[182:28.45]Soup's here.
[182:29.53]Get closer.
[182:32.87]What are you going to do?
[182:36.51]What are you going to do?
[182:44.80]What are you going to do?
[182:49.28]Oh, no.
[182:49.64]Stop shooting.
[182:53.73]How many...
[183:09.28]Let's get sucked into the wall.
[183:22.53]It's alright.
[183:23.13]It's OK.
[183:25.11]Oh, the game is.
[183:25.77]I think the game is crashing because of this.
[183:28.17]It does not like that.
[183:29.05]I'm lagging.
[183:40.19]I think it's cleared.
[183:40.85]I love how you breach some doors, but don't.
[183:48.36]What is go- Who brought the dork?
[183:59.84]You are playing those way too lightly.
[184:01.94]You're holding those like they're electrified.
[184:07.06]These guys are not rocking out.
[184:09.36]These guys suck.
[184:10.42]They're playing along to a MIDI file.
[184:14.00]No way.
[184:14.30]Just look at this, everybody.
[184:26.03]A walking disco ball decided to join us.
[184:30.75]Now the real show is about to go down.
[184:34.60]If you're a real torch head, shoot that motherfucking tin can till it fucking rattles.
[184:41.18]The real crime here is you using a track to sing to, suit.
[184:45.74]Citation.
[184:46.34]Granted.
[184:47.02]I guess he... What the...
[185:09.32]Did I just shoot somebody?
[185:12.22]Ow.
[185:12.86]I think I just shot somebody.
[185:15.05]I don't know.
[185:15.59]He said everybody turn around and start shooting him.
[185:17.65]I don't know.
[185:18.35]I thought they were all going to start attacking me with guns like that meme where everybody has a sword out.
[185:23.79]Like, oh, what's an opinion about like, oh, I don't like the Burger King McNuggets or whatever.
[185:34.15]I don't know.
[185:36.07]I thought they were all attacking me.
[185:39.97]Look what he says.
[185:40.63]He says, everybody get him.
[185:42.09]Shoot this motherfucker until he rattles.
[185:44.33]I don't know.
[185:44.93]I'm thinking I'm going to get attacked.
[185:51.59]I think they would get booed if they were here.
[186:09.84]Thank you.
[186:11.85]Oh, they're not cooking here at all.
[186:16.87]Listen.
[186:17.29]The real show.
[186:19.59]Everybody shoot him.
[186:20.69]Okay, so...
[186:42.60]They all pull guns out and it's like, okay, now we're going.
[186:56.03]I did not just, no, I didn't.
[186:57.05]Is that the drummer?
[186:59.63]Oh my God.
[187:01.35]Are these people?
[187:02.15]I don't know.
[187:03.33]This place cleared out so quick.
[187:09.58]Is this one of the band members?
[187:10.86]Is this the guy that was on the keyboard?
[187:12.40]That guy turned into mist.
[187:38.50]It's getting a little late.
[187:39.64]It's getting late.
[187:40.44]This game is a little too... Oh, it's too funny.
[187:46.37]Oh, it's getting late.
[187:50.63]You can't let him get me.
[187:51.47]I'm a celebrity.
[187:58.40]What?
[187:58.66]Oh.
[188:07.28]I can still do this.
[188:08.88]I just- I can still- This can't be.
[188:14.24]I had everything lined up perfectly!
[188:18.59]Let us talk.
[188:20.43]Stay the fuck away!
[188:22.41]You can't touch me!
[188:24.03]I do business with the new guy!
[188:26.69]You seem to know a lot about him.
[188:30.39]You're not getting anything out of me.
[188:32.57]Do you know how many cops I've killed?
[188:35.67]I ain't scared of you.
[188:37.18]Time for psychology.
[188:39.00]I'm pumped up with nuke like a freaking power plant.
[188:43.26]Then get ready for a meltdown.
[188:47.02]If you think you're going to get anything...
[188:54.69]Stress level at 92 beats per minute.
[188:56.67]This should be way higher.
[188:57.77]Didn't he just say he was nuked up like crazy?
[189:01.02]He's got a nice resting heart rate right now.
[189:05.58]This should be a 200.
[189:06.18]What do we do with him?
[189:12.81]Can I smush his head with the speaker?
[189:20.00]What's the combination for the safe?
[189:22.00]What's the combination for the fucking safe?
[189:24.13]What's the combination for the safe?
[189:26.17]Tell me!
[189:32.57]Sing.
[189:33.79]Oops.
[189:36.31]Alright, let him go.
[189:50.72]Is that supposed to scare me?
[189:52.90]Not a single scratch.
[189:57.51]What is going on?
[190:04.12]I think the game is fucked up.
[190:11.85]many more can I smash it with the guitar knock yourself out that's not even mine yeah well what about this hey that stuff doesn't come cheap yeah well what about this chair tell me what the car oh is beats permitted up at 128.

[191:28.57]Stay there.
[191:33.48]I just got all this... This shit is starting to burn.
[191:34.84]What do I do now?
[191:47.13]until every pig in Detroit is dead.
[191:50.75]Why can't I just like punch him in the face?
[191:53.85]What about, do you like this guitar?
[191:55.09]Do you like this guitar?
[191:56.41]Do you like this guitar?
[191:57.75]Do you like this guitar?
[191:59.17]It's not a way to treat a famous person.
[192:01.98]That's enough.
[192:05.72]I'll talk.
[192:09.00]Lois, I have Soot.
[192:10.70]He is ready to give me his statement about the new guy.
[192:17.07]Where is officer Lewis?
[192:18.79]Something's wrong with the friend here right next to me.
[192:22.59]We're having a nice citizen officer chat.
[192:27.43]Why don't you take my rising star and join us so we can exchange partners?
[192:37.90]Hey, what the hell are you doing now?
[192:41.30]The new guy is here.
[192:43.54]You are coming with me.
[192:44.94]Let's go.
[192:45.78]In that case, giddy up.
[192:51.19]Can you even feel the fear?
[192:53.43]Because you should be crapping in your pants right now.
[192:56.71]You have stepped into a big freaking mess.
[193:00.27]Cleaning up the town mess is what I do.
[193:09.12]That was an awesome concert.
[193:11.18]If it wasn't for you, they would have never have guessed it was all on playback.
[193:15.60]These are some shit acoustics.
[193:18.90]What?
[193:20.85]What is going on?
[193:23.03]Oh, what?
[193:23.43]We can walk.
[193:53.39]My left hip is getting a big numb.
[193:55.63]Can we swap sides?
[193:59.31]Oh, oh.
[194:02.41]I'm crashing out.
[194:03.91]I'm crashing out.
[194:09.47]What are we stopping for?
[194:11.93]Is your battery drained or something?
[194:13.49]I'm crashing out.
[194:23.53]Me and your partner here are growing impatient.
[194:26.65]Why don't you hurry up?
[194:28.17]I'm coming!
[194:28.73]Shit!
[194:39.50]What the hell?
[194:57.68]Lewis?
[194:58.70]I'm alright, Murphy.
[195:00.52]Drop your weapon.
[195:01.64]You are under arrest.
[195:03.00]I don't think you're reading this situation correctly.
[195:11.23]Thanks for the ride, big guy.
[195:14.67]It's the new guy in town.
[195:17.51]Welcome to Detroit.
[195:20.85]I assume you've seen our little TV spots.
[195:24.17]He's gonna shoot this guy in the face.
[195:26.15]You know the first rule of show business and drug dealing, right?
[195:31.98]Leave them wanting more.
[195:38.84]That's a lighter you got there.
[195:42.04]Murphy?
[195:43.46]Hate the smell of cigarettes.
[195:44.84]Something's wrong, cop.
[195:48.76]Hey, so.
[195:50.31]Crap.
[196:19.17]Murphy, what's happening?
[196:24.33]Now that we've got that out of the way, let me introduce myself.
[196:29.45]My name is Wendell Antonowski.
[196:32.89]I believe you've met my brother before.
[196:36.12]I could break his arm right now.
[196:40.62]My brother really did a number on you, didn't he?
[196:45.26]But, thanks to him,
[196:47.59]You've been given this great opportunity.
[196:51.34]What the fuck are you doing to him?
[196:53.52]There are people who would do anything to be in your position, to have your abilities.
[196:59.01]And yet, you attach yourself to something that is the weakest in you.
[197:03.83]To the part that's still human.
[197:09.85]Imagine does this take place between the movies without the things that limit you doing the first the second of between second and third Murphy Don't let him get inside your head after the second like her No attachments no leverage I Admit when I first heard that you were the reason my Idiot brother was dead.
[197:34.73]I Was furious
[197:42.25]Uh-uh.
[198:07.41]I liked her.
[198:20.44]Another fucking glitch.
[198:21.74]What a shit show.
[198:23.44]Everything's ready.
[198:24.48]It was all a nightmare.
[198:25.36]Switching back on already.
[198:27.66]I never left the room from the first hour of the game.
[198:30.37]Louis!
[198:33.07]Whoa.
[198:33.97]Robo.
[198:35.19]Calm down.
[198:35.85]He'll tear the equipment apart.
[198:37.53]Wendel Antonowsky ran away and Lewis is in the hospital.
[198:41.34]What did you do?
[198:42.22]Just stand there and watch it as it happened?
[198:46.42]I want to see her.
[198:48.46]She's in surgery as we speak, so that's not gonna happen.
[198:51.52]Instead, you're gonna go through with your psych evaluation.
[198:55.44]Let me go!
[198:57.12]The old man wasn't happy that I let you skip your first session, and was adamant that I make sure you attend this one.
[199:03.07]Especially since the problem of you malfunctioning is obviously persistent.
[199:07.79]So, Doctor, do your thing.
[199:10.05]What?
[199:11.15]Now?
[199:12.41]He's in no shape to be examined.
[199:14.61]I'm afraid that I must insist.
[199:16.71]This is highly unprofessional.
[199:19.11]I need to apprehend Wendel.
[199:22.35]I don't think you understand your options, Shiny.
[199:25.25]Just give me two 2000 V-Bucks cards.
[199:28.42]I can insert them into my chest cavity.
[199:32.08]And I'll be good to go.
[199:33.46]Just let me go.
[199:34.76]Doctor?
[199:35.86]If this is supposed to resemble a therapy session in any way, I need everyone that isn't my client to leave.
[199:42.26]That is not negotiable.
[199:44.58]And is it necessary to have him restrained?
[199:47.46]That's for your safety.
[199:49.18]What if he loses control?
[199:52.13]Exactly.
[199:55.25]If anything goes wrong, just use this reset button.
[199:58.95]One press and he goes back to La La Land.
[200:01.51]Am I getting evaluated right now?
[200:03.59]Robo, see me after this is over.
[200:08.74]Okay.
[200:09.68]I'm sorry it has to look like this.
[200:11.52]Are you at least sitting comfortably enough to have this conversation?
[200:19.34]uh this is irrelevant it is irrelevant how comfortable I am it all contributes to your overall performance I understand this is not an ideal situation and this is probably the last place you want to be right now I'm not the only one unwilling to be here your heart rate is above 120 bpm you're equipped with a heart rate monitor I imagine it comes in handy in your line of work
[200:47.94]This is some Westworld shit.
[200:49.64]Okay.
[200:49.74]They call me Robocop.
[200:50.38]Which one?
[200:50.79]Murphy or Robocop?
[201:21.67]I am Robocop.
[201:22.73]Robocop is the name I was given.
[201:26.15]If that is what you prefer, then Robocop it is.
[201:29.44]What?
[201:29.72]I've worked with many police officers that have gone through traumatic experiences.
[201:34.56]But I think we can both agree that you are no ordinary police officer.
[201:38.50]We're three and a half hours into the game and we got a, she will remember that?
[201:44.55]How do you see your situation?
[201:48.89]Resurrected policeman, crime prevention unit 001, part human, part machine.
[202:00.94]I am part human, part machine.
[202:07.42]I am a cybernetic organism, a fusion of both the remains of the policeman Alex Murphy and this high-tech armor.
[202:15.61]So we can't rule out that your actions are influenced by your human part.
[202:20.01]But that's something that I've already learned from the reports.
[202:22.98]What I would much rather hear is how do you perceive yourself?
[202:27.38]Perceive?
[202:28.78]Yes.
[202:29.48]See, what I found immensely helpful in working with my patients is transparency.
[202:34.42]In order to help each other, we need to be able to see each other fully.
[202:40.42]This is going to be some weird shit where it's like, what's your favorite food?
[202:42.99]Like hot dog.
[202:46.76]And then it's like, oh, I'll remember that.
[202:48.76]And then four hours from now, it could have been hot dog, hamburger, or fried chicken.
[202:55.93]And four hours from now, the only reason why that matters is because I'm going to get offered out of the blue, just, oh, here, here, have something to eat.
[203:03.09]And it's just going to be like a hot dog for one second on screen.
[203:06.97]Like, oh, whoa, it remembered.
[203:08.45]No way.
[203:08.95]It remembered what I wanted.
[203:12.42]Okay, this is me.
[203:14.82]Is this what you wanted or I warned you?
[203:20.20]Should we scare?
[203:27.50]Is this what you wanted to see?
[203:31.82]Now that you see me the way I am, do you wish to push the reset button?
[203:35.71]She didn't like that.
[203:36.69]Your heart rate remains high.
[203:39.07]No, not at all.
[203:41.66]It's actually my secret that is making me nervous, not yours.
[203:45.40]You're not the only one here with prosthetic body parts.
[203:49.20]This hand... You must have wondered what happened.
[203:52.86]Some time ago, I was a victim of a crime.
[203:54.98]A thief broke into my house.
[203:58.30]He made a lot of noise, and my neighbors called the police.
[204:01.40]An ED-209 reacted to the call and mistakenly recognized me as a threat.
[204:07.06]My hand was red mist moments later.
[204:10.03]since that day I have become let's say a little leery of machines only malfunctioning machine do you fear malfunctioning machines I fear the unpredictability that machines bring with them so when I heard there was a chance to contribute to the research on the stability of ocp's mechanical units I jumped at the opportunity I hope you don't find it unprofessional getting that off my chest made me feel a bit better
[204:39.39]ED-209 is a funny name for a robot.
[204:43.01]That's from the first movie.
[204:44.31]Okay, well she likes us.
[204:44.95]Evaluation.
[205:09.66]Hold on a second.
[205:10.36]I... I didn't... There was a murder that I didn't solve?
[205:15.72]When did that happen?
[205:27.13]Oh, well.
[205:27.85]Okay.
[205:28.29]I got the arcade owner.
[205:29.87]I smashed his head in.
[205:31.78]I'll take a B.
[205:43.85]Oh, I got three skill points.
[205:53.02]One, two, three.
[205:53.90]Damn it.
[205:56.46]Maybe Vitality or Armor.
[206:01.37]What does this do?
[206:01.93]Deduction, Enhanced Scanning.
[206:03.43]Meh.
[206:11.05]I feel like this is not that... I don't know what this means, though.
[206:13.47]Lowest outcome thresholds with a Ming.
[206:15.55]Does that mean... I don't know what that actually means.
[206:31.22]Dash cooldown.
[206:33.06]Being able to use those things on the wall actually sounds pretty good.
[206:38.05]Yeah, let's use the boxes.
[206:41.08]I am going to do it, yeah.
[206:44.98]Then maybe armor.
[206:48.40]Or combat.
[206:50.90]I get a shockwave with this.
[206:52.08]I'll do combat.
[206:59.11]Okay, so I can actually use the things on the wall.
[207:08.45]Okay.
[207:10.98]all done robo there's something I need to show you games extra ram I know that ocp can be a real pain in the ass but this might change your mind a bit
[207:28.44]We've been working behind the scenes on giving your sidearm the treatment it deserves.
[207:32.64]The Auto 9 can now be equipped with a motherboard.
[207:35.88]Once the motherboard is in, you'll be able to mount a number of processors on it.
[207:40.55]Each processor can vastly improve your aim, damage, or stability.
[207:44.43]Gun upgrade?
[207:45.05]See for yourself.
[207:49.61]Insert a chip into an empty slot of your motherboard.
[207:51.71]The chips have different types of connections and boost levels.
[207:56.09]Okay.
[207:56.85]Avoid the red components.
[207:58.31]Reducers which lower the weapon's stats.
[208:01.51]Each motherboard has different specialization, layout, and perks.
[208:03.77]Only one motherboard can be active at a time.
[208:08.53]What am I looking at?
[208:11.79]Weapon damage.
[208:12.29]Okay.
[208:12.95]What is... 20... Oh.
[208:13.33]22% weapon damage.
[208:17.27]Then...
[208:24.89]spread alright so what's this full auto increase the volume of gore visual effects I feel like we have to do that reload speed yeah wait something wrong with it I think I have to get this too wait what's going on
[209:00.88]Look at the shape.
[209:02.34]Oh, it's the shape.
[209:05.38]But why does this fit there then?
[209:06.38]Ah, chip merging.
[209:14.90]Oh, man, this is kind of complicated.
[209:23.69]Alright, hold on.
[209:25.79]What pieces do I need?
[209:27.03]Oops.
[209:27.55]Okay.
[209:27.69]Merge the lower value chips.
[209:28.95]Be careful of the shapes though.
[209:29.81]This is 22.
[209:30.37]I'm going to save the 22.
[209:38.94]Merging is bad right now.
[209:57.95]Okay, let me just get, let's go get, let's get the gore.
[210:02.76]I'm sure I can replace these later.
[210:03.86]It doesn't matter.
[210:06.78]Okay, so now there is a 10% penalty, but we get more gore.
[210:15.22]Weapon spread.
[210:19.38]Weapon damage.
[210:26.98]Merge once all the spaces are filled up.
[210:29.16]Oh, that's a good idea.
[210:30.00]Okay.
[210:35.71]I kind of can't get this one.
[210:37.85]This is a armor piercing reload speed, but 14% more damage, weapon spread, reload speed, and magazine capacity.
[210:55.40]Oh, shit.
[210:58.53]So you have to avoid the red.
[210:59.53]But wait a minute.
[211:00.17]Does that mean I can do this?
[211:02.11]Hold on.
[211:04.17]Can I... No.
[211:06.25]So you would get the red.
[211:10.67]Red nodes can be avoided.
[211:12.13]How would I avoid this one?
[211:14.73]Oh, hold on.
[211:15.33]Yeah, but wouldn't... I think I have to activate this one.
[211:23.92]Because I want the gore.
[211:27.46]Use the 16 one instead.
[211:33.48]Use 22 and 16.
[211:36.76]Will it actually work?
[211:38.46]Oh, it doesn't.
[211:39.10]I thought you had to use ones that were identical.
[211:44.13]So it's just the fact that it won't go that way.
[211:46.17]Okay, I get it.
[211:47.19]I thought the slot, I thought you had to fill the slots.
[211:53.17]So where's 22? 22.
[211:58.97]Can I only fill up one?
[212:00.53]Oh, you can only... Okay, so 20% weapon spread.
[212:02.65]16 will do it too.
[212:08.68]And then I can go up this way.
[212:10.90]And then I need one that goes down.
[212:13.80]12%.
[212:13.82]That 20% one I should use maybe down here.
[212:20.63]Shit.
[212:29.96]Okay, I can't avoid this.
[212:31.62]So, I don't need the full auto.
[212:32.74]That's fine.
[212:34.84]Which one's just pointing down?
[212:36.20]This one.
[212:40.49]Weapon damage.
[212:41.49]Let's go.
[212:42.09]And then... Yeah!
[212:51.89]Wait, this one's 14.
[212:54.10]I can't even use it.
[212:54.64]15. 15.
[213:00.60]Cool.
[213:03.20]Let's do it.
[213:03.70]Alright, now chip merging.
[213:05.08]What the fuck did I just do?
[213:09.96]Okay.
[213:21.09]Should I just try it?
[213:30.13]That was kind of not worth it.
[213:32.10]Processes can be salvaged from old devices.
[213:35.30]That's a cool system.
[213:36.52]That's fun.
[213:37.02]I like that.
[213:37.82]Stop talking to me, man.
[213:39.94]Alright, I'm going upstairs.
[214:02.17]Later in the game it probably gets better.
[214:03.33]I'm curious.
[214:06.43]Not yet.
[214:07.65]But she's been through worse.
[214:09.85]Don't think too much about it.
[214:11.63]You know you're right.
[214:12.65]We should stay strong and focused just like her.
[214:22.99]That was a coin game sound effect.
[214:30.56]You know, you never see a piece of salmon in a made-up police officer office.
[214:38.47]The precinct always just has chips and pizza.
[214:40.79]If I get well, what's that?
[214:43.37]Why would you eat fish?
[214:51.73]I don't know, like fish sandwich or something.
[214:55.27]It's always pizza boxes.
[214:59.93]Did you say Lewis?
[215:02.11]Yeah.
[215:03.63]Me and a bunch of guys decided to sign this get well card for her.
[215:08.15]I figured that you'd want to sign it as well.
[215:10.04]Oh, I'll sign it.
[215:10.88]A get well card.
[215:13.02]Yeah, I know.
[215:13.98]It's just that we want to let her know we're with her.
[215:21.06]I would like to sign the card.
[215:23.04]I would like to sign it.
[215:25.52]Thanks Murphy, I knew you'd understand.
[215:28.52]Actually, there are a few signatures that we still need.
[215:32.22]Could you ask him?
[215:33.72]I think I need a break.
[215:35.61]I just start Kowalski is hiding somewhere in the lobby.
[215:38.51]You're not gonna put me on one of these.
[215:41.61]I want to sign it.
[215:42.23]What's wrong with his back?
[215:55.35]Do I not know who Officer Kowalski is?
[216:00.91]I don't know who that is.
[216:01.77]I will find him, I guess.
[216:15.32]Couldn't I just go... Kowalski!
[216:19.08]Just wait till somebody looks at me?
[216:20.40]Why do I have to scan everybody?
[216:39.93]few isn't it alright sign this oh I didn't see you there murphy what are you doing here officer nothing much just trying to collect my thoughts would you sign the get well card for lewis I am supposed to get it signed and then pass it on to another officer why would I be doing this that's a great idea
[217:10.61]I feel like humanoid robots would be doing this shit in the beginning.
[217:15.18]Could you pass it along to another officer?
[217:17.54]I think I'd like to stay here for a little bit longer.
[217:23.18]No crying on the force.
[217:24.98]There is no crying on the force.
[217:28.33]Well, I guess sometimes there is.
[217:31.77]Kurtz hasn't signed it yet.
[217:33.79]He was in the locker room last time I saw him.
[217:41.72]Why would you say that?
[217:46.82]Where is he?
[217:47.22]In here?
[217:47.96]I am looking for Officer Kurtz.
[217:53.77]He's in the shower.
[217:55.17]Actually, he's been in there for half an hour.
[217:57.13]What are you drinking?
[217:59.97]Drinking on the job?
[218:00.73]What is it?
[218:03.57]Booze.
[218:04.35]You're under arrest.
[218:21.41]What's that?
[218:23.03]What's that?
[218:26.03]Cocaine.
[218:27.13]You're under arrest.
[218:40.77]As he said...
[218:50.36]My heat signature recognizes that the water is cold.
[218:53.76]Is everything alright, Officer Kurtz?
[218:56.45]Oh, you're talking to me?
[218:59.05]Yeah, I guess I stayed here longer than you anticipated.
[219:01.71]I have a card to sign.
[219:03.85]It is for Lewis.
[219:05.37]I'd love to sign it, but I don't want to get it wet.
[219:09.21]Could you grab my towel for me?
[219:10.70]A yellow one.
[219:11.70]It should be by my locker.
[219:13.94]Okay, sir.
[219:28.24]There's a towel.
[219:31.82]Did he buy his locker?
[219:36.01]That's a towel right there.
[219:38.21]Bro's got, you're hoarding the towels.
[219:54.98]Just leave.
[219:56.18]Just leave.
[219:58.30]Leave him in here.
[220:03.06]Throw a roll of toilet paper over here.
[220:05.71]Good luck.
[220:06.07]There you go.
[220:07.51]Thanks.
[220:08.41]Just give me a minute.
[220:14.95]There.
[220:15.59]Signed.
[220:16.92]I think that it's beautiful what you're doing.
[220:19.52]You are shivering.
[220:21.34]Yeah, I was lost in my thoughts.
[220:23.07]Didn't notice that I used up all the hot water.
[220:26.11]Thinking about Lewis.
[220:28.29]Yeah, but I can't imagine what you're thinking.
[220:30.95]She's your partner.
[220:32.39]Speaking of partner, I see that O'Neal hasn't signed a card yet.
[220:36.00]Be a good guy and get it to her, okay?
[220:38.06]She's at the range.
[220:39.70]She'll yell at me if she finds out there was a card for Lewis and she didn't get to sign it.
[220:43.10]I better get to sign this.
[220:44.06]I will make sure that happens.
[221:14.16]I want to see if he opened the locker.
[221:20.97]I want to see what was in his locker.
[221:22.39]He was... I want to see what the AI did.
[221:29.81]I want to see what the AI pathing was going to do.
[221:31.68]I was curious if his AI was going to just walk him into the middle of the precinct.
[221:44.36]Oh, I gotta go downstairs.
[221:59.40]God, I am really am like a robot.
[222:01.66]I don't know.
[222:02.08]I don't know where to go.
[222:07.34]I need to be programmed.
[222:08.40]Somebody program me to find this place.
[222:10.16]Wait, didn't I fucking kill this person?
[222:12.14]You're like a Roomba.
[222:12.78]Okay, it's here.
[222:13.52]Wait.
[222:13.62]No, I need to get this signature.
[222:42.61]Big server room?
[222:56.11]You alright?
[223:04.42]Oh, shit.
[223:04.84]No, I don't want to... I want to get out of here.
[223:08.12]How do I get out?
[223:10.08]How do I leave?
[223:11.20]I need to fail.
[223:24.87]I was trying to click out.
[223:26.86]I'm fucking tired.
[223:27.26]Test the service weapon?
[223:28.38]I need to get at least 15 points?
[223:29.86]Come on.
[223:55.83]I guess you don't have any problems with it alright I'm done thank you sign the card I just destroyed your score your service weapon is calibrated correctly yeah I guess so what is the matter I can't lie I wanted to come here and blow off some steam but my hands are shaking thinking about Louis officer
[224:22.91]It's just that if it happened to you, it could have happened to any one of us.
[224:28.06]Lewis is one tough cookie.
[224:30.06]She'll pull through, I'm sure of it.
[224:32.42]But I'm not so sure I could say the same thing about my partner.
[224:37.30]I'm sorry.
[224:37.76]I didn't mean to make it up.
[224:38.66]You know, it's all about the character, right?
[224:40.34]It's all about the characterization.
[224:42.88]So, if this game, if we were just a guy, if we were just a regular guy, just, oh yeah, it's Bill on the force.
[224:53.39]I don't think it would have... I don't care.
[224:57.89]It's because it's Robocop doing all this dumb, weird, goofy shit that just makes it so much... That's what makes everything.
[225:07.73]If we were just a guy, I wouldn't be having nearly as much fun.
[225:12.06]Even if every single thing played out exactly the same.
[225:16.14]Did you just get why this is funny?
[225:17.62]Yeah.
[225:19.64]Yeah.
[225:24.25]it is difficult is there anything I can do for you you can sign this get well card for lewis sure thing what if it was an off-brand robocop that's true what if it was just what if it was a guy with a helmet on almost everyone's already here that says a lot and he was kind of a weirdo there's only one person missing sergeant reed he's in the garage
[225:52.59]Okay, I got, I think, probably my last break coming up here.
[225:55.35]Let's take this final break and then probably go maybe for like another hour or so.
[226:03.81]Judge Dredd.
[226:05.53]Yeah, but Judge Dredd is... That's just Iron Man.
[226:14.44]If it was a guy pretending to... No, it doesn't work.
[226:29.11]Paul Blart, AI security.
[226:34.71]Inspector Gadget is not.
[226:36.05]Inspector Gadget's cool, though.
[226:43.62]Alright.
[226:44.94]Nightmare Blunt Rotation.
[226:47.22]Robocop, Inspector Gadget, Judge Dredd.
[226:52.14]And fucking Palpatine.
[226:54.26]Think about that one.
[226:54.92]I'll be back.
[227:20.66]He literally only knows Star Wars and Marvel characters?
[227:24.98]Is that what somebody just said?
[227:28.62]No.
[227:37.23]How about... How about... Judge Dredd?
[230:46.68]Um, The Fork from Toy Story.
[230:49.07]Uh... Holden Caulfield from Catcher in the Rye.
[230:54.93]Um... The Dog from Two Stupid Dogs.
[231:00.22]Uh... I've been into a lot of fucking characters that I know.
[231:06.45]Um...
[231:11.17]The weasel from I Am Weasel.
[231:13.21]Cow and chicken.
[231:13.93]The red guy.
[231:14.55]I don't know.
[231:19.63]That's a lot.
[231:20.27]That would have been like 40 or 50 at least.
[231:31.30]Anyways.
[231:32.94]Oh, an ad just played.
[231:33.80]That's right.
[231:34.32]Shit.
[231:34.84]It's alright.
[231:36.32]The VOD might have it.
[231:39.47]The horse from Horsin' Around?
[231:42.97]You forgot about Stuart Little?
[231:44.35]Dude, I forgot Stuart Little.
[231:45.83]What am I thinking?
[231:46.57]I still have to... Okay, I gotta get this card signed.
[232:03.11]Oh, Garfield from Garfield?
[232:04.98]That's right.
[232:05.44]I forgot about Garfield from Garfield.
[232:07.02]You're right.
[232:08.89]I forget too many of these things.
[232:10.13]What do you need?
[232:17.23]I need to get this signed.
[232:21.59]I noticed you running around the precinct.
[232:24.22]I am collecting signatures on a get well card for Lewis.
[232:28.60]I know that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
[232:31.70]I ride everyone hard and they probably see me as a drill sergeant.
[232:35.84]Maybe they think that I do it because I don't care.
[232:38.68]You guys are crazy.
[232:39.46]I love how you guys are just naming random characters now.
[232:43.00]You're just throwing stuff out there.
[233:05.06]You can't say a boneless chicken is not a character.
[233:09.23]That is a food.
[233:13.77]We are a family.
[233:15.63]You should sign it.
[233:17.47]Everyone's here already.
[233:19.38]Lewis, she made an impact.
[233:21.76]We've got to get the ones that did that.
[233:23.02]This is a long side mission.
[233:24.28]I better get a lot of good stuff for this.
[233:26.80]Right.
[233:27.70]Keep the card.
[233:29.23]She should get it from you.
[233:30.95]Thank you, Murphy.
[233:34.52]Alright, do I sign it?
[233:39.15]I want to sign it.
[233:40.01]I didn't even sign it.
[233:40.67]It's about being a good friend, not the reward.
[233:54.57]I wanted to sign it.
[234:09.87]Thank you for this opportunity, Mr. Becker.
[234:12.69]You are very determined.
[234:14.96]I must have seen your application like 20 times.
[234:16.90]That's a giant marshmallow.
[234:18.42]I assumed they were getting lost in the mail.
[234:20.06]That'd be awesome.
[234:21.22]That didn't stop you, did it?
[234:23.52]You're persistent and capable too.
[234:26.24]Highest marks on all the written tests.
[234:29.12]Pretty much an ideal candidate.
[234:31.32]Aside from the fact that you don't meet any of the physical requirements, that's actually remarkable.
[234:36.63]Short stuff.
[234:38.11]Unfortunately, sir.
[234:39.89]Why is being a cop so important to you?
[234:42.59]My father was a police officer, and his father was one too.
[234:46.53]A police family, huh?
[234:49.19]It must be heartbreaking not to be able to continue a family tradition.
[234:53.59]You know, I have the power to look the other way and make you a cop despite your... shortcomings.
[235:01.60]In exchange, I only ask for one thing.
[235:04.36]Your complete loyalty.
[235:07.07]And maybe a touch of gratitude as well.
[235:08.89]That sure is kind of huge.
[235:09.73]Will I still get a badge?
[235:11.51]Like a proper police officer?
[235:13.45]Badge?
[235:14.41]Oh yeah, sure.
[235:16.74]Then Officer Washington is reporting for duty.
[235:19.44]Good.
[235:20.98]There you go, young'un.
[235:22.86]Is... Is that blood?
[235:25.50]We don't make a badge for every new officer.
[235:28.32]We just reassign the old ones after cops retire.
[235:33.18]Or die.
[235:35.29]Robocop?
[235:36.87]I'm a big fan.
[235:38.57]That's great, because you'll be spending a lot of time together.
[235:42.19]Meaning?
[235:43.51]Aside from his regular dispatch duty, Officer Washington will become your personal overseer.
[235:49.68]Overseer?
[235:51.08]Yes, you will report to me on his every action.
[235:54.00]Hopefully that will prevent him from continuing to tarnish his already murky reputation.
[235:58.92]His recent behavior casts a shadow on OCP and we can't have that.
[236:04.00]That's a lot of responsibility.
[236:05.00]That was a nice sitcom entrance, yeah.
[236:06.50]Every other cop refused this post.
[236:08.46]We just needed to hear the, woo, woo, yeah, woo.
[236:10.04]You don't want to jeopardize your career, right?
[236:14.19]No, sir.
[236:15.27]I would like to proceed with my investigation now that we know that the new guy is Wendell Antonowski.
[236:22.17]Was he even listening to anything I've been saying?
[236:25.11]Absolutely fucking not.
[236:26.55]You're off the case.
[236:27.73]Actually, you're off all cases.
[236:30.30]There's a bunch of documents that need archiving in the records room.
[236:33.44]That's your priority now.
[236:35.04]No, I just did a bunch of... People just signed a card for 30 minutes.
[236:38.42]I'll tell Achilles about what's what in this godforsaken place.
[236:44.64]It's Ulysses, sir.
[236:46.32]Hey, first rule, kiddo.
[236:47.96]Never question your superiors.
[236:53.14]I'm on desk duty?
[236:55.46]I actually have to go to the records room.
[237:01.01]I'll be in here for one minute.
[237:03.13]Just gotta check something behind one of the desks.
[237:10.53]Fucking asshole, man.
[237:12.21]Put me on, gonna put you on death's duty.
[237:13.61]Shut the fuck up.
[237:15.61]Lucky I don't fucking slap you in the fucking head.
[237:18.47]Stupid motherfucker, man.
[237:20.86]I try one minute to do something fucking good for somebody and all of a sudden this dickhead has to fucking talk shit all the time.
[237:27.22]Oh my fucking god.
[237:30.47]Yeah, now you're sitting in that chair.
[237:32.19]That chair that I bought you.
[237:33.61]You fucking dickhead.
[237:36.11]God!
[237:37.73]Oh, I just want to smash his fucking skull in.
[237:39.76]Uh, I dropped a little... There was a coffee stain over there.
[237:46.00]I dropped.
[237:48.69]Uh, it should be... I should probably clean it up later, but hey.
[237:52.53]I'm ready to get going.
[238:03.49]Anybody hear that?
[238:11.56]I want to do more of these.
[238:12.36]I wish I could sit down here too.
[238:23.56]Good morning.
[238:24.26]Alright, let's do it.
[238:30.14]Fine.
[238:33.39]OK, hi, Murphy.
[238:35.39]I was told you'd come to help me.
[238:38.09]God, what seems to be the problem for Mr. Becker wants you to do some maintenance work, so, you know, please scan the servers properly.
[238:47.38]Let me get how sure they are.
[238:48.68]But he insisted I found a job.
[238:52.52]Hold on, I'm sorry.
[238:54.98]Hold on.
[239:00.65]It's OK.
[239:09.76]It's okay, I'm just doing record room shit.
[239:26.74]Okay, this is... This is Vital Lore?
[239:39.99]okay here we go let's see if this one's any good okay show me where the problem is scanning working perfectly
[240:15.12]Find the anomaly.
[240:22.72]I don't understand how to search.
[240:29.20]Is it... voiceprint?
[240:37.29]Is it... sex?
[240:42.61]Not sex?
[240:46.14]affiliation case files oh dear there it is I found it he's never been charged well that's hard to believe there's a neat stop laughing see who attempted to access his file before you did maybe that'll help us alright studio audience settle down officer briggs briggs that must be the last lead that he checked before going missing so his case led him to the street vultures territory
[241:19.30]I guess.
[241:21.26]Maybe those two cases are connected after all.
[241:24.40]I'll have to report this to Sergeant Reed.
[241:27.20]And I am on my way.
[241:29.58]There's nothing I can say to stop you, is there?
[241:32.82]No.
[241:33.90]Then instead I'll say, go kick ass for Lewis.
[241:40.66]Sure thing.
[241:44.55]Good as new.
[241:49.88]Alright, let me... Hold on, let me turn this up.
[241:57.32]Let me turn this up.
[241:59.74]I'll turn this back on when I get into like a fight.
[242:05.97]The whole studio audience is high.
[242:07.45]Alright, I'll turn it on now.
[242:20.15]I wanted to say that this is an incredible honor for me.
[242:23.65]But, you know, I get the feeling you don't see eye to eye with Mr. Becker.
[242:28.63]No, I do not.
[242:29.47]Despite the position I'm in, I'll do my best to assist you in any way I can.
[242:34.70]So, what are you doing here?
[242:37.24]I am going to Highland Park.
[242:40.20]Isn't that Street Vulture's turf?
[242:42.14]That is where the lead took Briggs.
[242:44.17]It could be connected to Wendell.
[242:46.75]Oh, man.
[242:48.24]That's exactly what Mr. Becker told me you shouldn't do.
[242:51.19]It's my duty to stop you.
[242:53.27]Is it even safe for you to go?
[242:54.43]Your duty?
[242:55.03]I mean, think of yourself.
[242:57.51]You keep malfunctioning, right?
[242:59.57]What if something happens again?
[243:00.75]Hey, Murphy.
[243:03.41]I found this on the back seat of your cruiser.
[243:05.97]It's for you.
[243:07.35]I can't let you go.
[243:08.11]Who is this comedy character?
[243:09.69]Is there some sort of a command for that?
[243:12.84]Robocop, off.
[243:16.42]Robocop, stay.
[243:19.85]Hey, all cops have to follow rules.
[243:22.71]Especially you.
[243:24.39]You're a cop and a machine, so you can't go.
[243:26.77]Your systems won't allow it.
[243:30.76]Right?
[243:33.22]Wrong.
[243:37.56]Robocop?
[243:41.35]Robocop?
[243:47.68]Don't do this to me.
[243:48.40]Not on my first day.
[243:58.88]I don't know.
[243:59.30]It's getting a little late.
[244:00.90]This might be the end of the stream here.
[244:04.04]I know you're listening.
[244:06.02]There is still time to stop and turn back.
[244:08.53]The street vultures are territorial and vicious.
[244:11.83]You wouldn't want to be caught on their turf.
[244:13.75]Especially by their leader, Spike.
[244:19.32]Is this a car mission?
[244:21.24]No, it's not.
[244:52.92]Okay, I'm gonna turn it off in a second.
[244:54.64]My fucking head hurts.
[244:55.52]Alright, I'm gonna turn it off.
[244:59.89]I think, uh... I think that's where I'm calling it.
[245:22.51]I think that's where it has to end for tonight.
[245:30.42]Oh, that was so stupid.
[245:35.72]Everyone wonders why a laugh track was ever added to a TV show.
[245:40.94]It's because something about it just makes anything just stupid.
[245:50.84]Especially when, oh my god.
[245:58.25]Have you met God?
[246:00.91]Um, no, but I think, well, okay.
[246:06.78]God is in all of us.
[246:09.46]And I look in the mirror.
[246:12.91]Gotcha.
[246:13.23]I mean, liar.
[246:26.60]That's a narcissist?
[246:27.54]No, but God is in all of us.
[246:29.62]God is all of us.
[246:31.12]What?
[246:33.35]I'm talking about you too.
[246:34.45]I just spit everywhere.
[246:39.69]No.
[246:39.75]You got it wrong.
[246:47.81]You got it wrong.
[246:50.47]Oh, Jesus.
[246:51.37]Not the laugh track.
[246:52.37]No, no, no.
[246:53.78]I can't be in a sitcom.
[246:55.75]Oh, get me out of here.
[247:02.25]Alright, guys.
[247:06.81]I'll see you later.
[247:09.41]That is the end.
[247:10.27]I think I might pick this back up.
[247:13.85]It's actually been really fun.
[247:19.02]Oh, credits work.
[247:19.98]Pog.
[247:22.14]I'm not seeing any PogChamps.
[247:26.39]But yeah, thanks a lot, guys.
[247:28.51]There might be a stream tomorrow night.
[247:30.67]If there is a stream tomorrow night, it will be a late night Chrono Trigger chill stream.
[247:39.51]So it'll start pretty late.
[247:42.69]If there is nothing tomorrow night, then I'll see you on Tuesday.
[247:46.62]I think that's the day that Ster and I are going to be doing stuff, so.
[247:52.12]And then maybe something Wednesday, and then I will play Chrono Trigger.
[247:55.62]I want to beat it.
[247:57.86]It's not going to disappear for like a month, don't worry.
[248:20.40]Dude, that's fucked up.
[248:22.18]That's fucked up.
[248:25.62]Okay, that was fucked up.
[248:27.50]This person said, I'm going to put a Chrono Trigger to my head if you don't play Indiana Jones.
[248:32.34]It's like, bro, fucking chill out.
[248:41.51]You need to fucking relax, man.
[248:53.87]Okay, is Indiana Jones a fun game?
[248:55.73]I think I've asked that before.
[248:56.81]Dude, what the fuck?
[249:07.21]Alright.
[249:09.03]One of my mods just said no.
[249:10.35]It looks fun.
[249:18.48]It's on Game Pass.
[249:19.92]Oh, okay.
[249:27.75]It is a fun game.
[249:28.69]Maybe I'd play it just to like just mess around in it.
[249:31.29]It's a comedy game.
[249:32.11]Okay.
[249:36.64]Okay, is it a fun comedy game for like 10 minutes?
[249:39.90]Or is it a like a 50 hour long, like four hours of cutscenes game?
[249:56.38]It's 40 hours.
[249:59.85]It's not really a cutscene game.
[250:00.99]Okay.
[250:05.03]You can throw stuff in that one.
[250:06.35]Oh, yep.
[250:13.05]It's perfect.
[250:16.74]I don't mind playing cutscene heavy games.
[250:18.34]It's just as long as there's fun stuff to do in it.
[250:22.50]There's cutscenes in this one.
[250:25.18]I think this game had the perfect amount of dialog sequences and action.
[250:36.10]All the dialog did not overstay.
[250:38.26]You could just kind of skip it if you wanted to as well.
[251:00.86]Yeah, no, I had a good time.
[251:01.66]This was a lot of fun.
[251:03.38]The Jump King game was fun, too.
[251:04.64]It's just hard.
[251:08.30]Indiana Jones has a caveman mode for puzzles.
[251:10.68]Okay.
[251:11.86]Well, now I'm very interested.
[251:16.76]Alright, see you guys maybe tomorrow.
[251:17.82]If not tomorrow, then we'll see you Tuesday.
[251:19.84]Alright.
[251:22.21]Take care.
[251:22.69]Call your mother.
[251:23.19]You know the drill.
[251:23.99]See you later.
[251:28.73]Thank you.
[252:03.62]you
