[02:41.92]Really appreciate that.
[02:44.14]Watching old videos of mine reminds me of how old I am too.
[02:49.92]Because I get to watch myself degrade over time.
[02:56.80]I get a 10-year mirror.
[02:59.88]Don't you understand?
[03:03.93]Guys, I used to make a video like every other day.
[03:08.79]You know that thing?
[03:09.53]Oh, take a picture of myself once every day for 10 years.
[03:12.35]I did that.
[03:16.08]I can go back and just see me aging over a decade.
[03:27.07]You're aging like fine wine.
[03:28.71]Hey, thanks.
[03:30.05]I think I'm doing okay.
[03:32.59]Oh, but anyways...
[03:34.93]Let's talk about some stuff.
[03:36.31]Before we get stu- I know, I always do.
[03:37.87]Oh, alright, here we go.
[03:39.55]He's gonna talk about stuff.
[03:41.41]This one's important.
[03:42.99]Don't- Nobody say it.
[03:43.73]Nobody say it.
[03:44.17]Because I didn't get a chance to tell anybody yet.
[03:47.51]Don't say it.
[03:49.43]Don't say it.
[03:52.84]Ah, somebody said it.
[03:54.22]Ah, shit.
[03:54.86]What do I do now?
[03:55.70]Turn the stream off.
[03:58.52]The carnival stream... Is set... For...
[04:05.37]September 21st, 2019.
[04:09.16]Of this year.
[04:11.90]Of this year.
[04:18.01]So I'm fucking excited.
[04:21.51]A lot of work and a lot of time went into this.
[04:24.51]And I hadn't even gotten started.
[04:27.58]I actually have to get on a plane next week.
[04:32.24]And fly across the country to the facility.
[04:34.72]And go back and forth.
[04:37.78]We're going to do a site visit.
[04:39.18]We're going to walk around.
[04:40.14]We're going to talk about everything that's going to happen.
[04:48.03]It is not Boston.
[04:50.01]No.
[04:51.09]Somewhere else.
[04:54.53]It is somewhere else in the United States of America.
[05:02.87]But the facility seems pretty great.
[05:06.02]The person that's helping me and the team that's helping me work on that end of things.
[05:11.52]Area 51.
[05:12.96]No, it's not in Nevada.
[05:16.72]It's in another state in the United States.
[05:23.57]No, it's not Florida.
[05:25.35]We don't have to guess what state it is.
[05:28.31]You're going to find out soon enough.
[05:38.14]He's going to Canada.
[05:39.38]No, but that's a reality now.
[05:42.82]And a bunch of resources going into this.
[05:46.70]I can finally tell you that it's really actually September 21st.
[05:51.87]There's like two teams involved with this, so it's not like, oh, September 23rd, maybe, maybe October.
[05:58.34]No, there's a contract.
[05:59.88]So... I hope it's fun.
[06:02.78]You'll get more details as we go.
[06:11.11]Let's hope it's... I think it's gonna be fucking awesome.
[06:18.30]Get a lawyer.
[06:20.12]I am a lawyer.
[06:22.10]I just looked.
[06:22.70]It's a big contract.
[06:24.50]It's like 25 pages long.
[06:26.72]And I just like skimmed it.
[06:28.22]And I was like, yeah!
[06:30.38]And I flipped it over and I signed it.
[06:35.22]The best kind of lawyer there is.
[06:38.91]One that skims contracts.
[06:48.73]Click agree.
[06:49.79]Yeah, it's an it's the end user license agreement on anything you play or do Let me get my controller I don't want to sound out of the loop here, but uh or sound mean but why are you doing this?
[07:09.29]Um I don't know
[07:18.07]Because I want to.
[07:24.49]I don't really have a reason for anything I do here.
[07:30.13]Mainly I think it's because I think it'll be fun.
[07:34.21]And I think the community over the years has been involved in so many things and we've done so many things that it's fun to do shit.
[07:46.19]It's fun to make stuff.
[07:50.15]I don't really have a reason.
[07:55.55]Alright, let me open it up.
[08:02.66]Like, win or lose, I don't care.
[08:05.96]I want to try.
[08:08.92]I want to try to do something fun.
[08:15.12]I think that you guys know that over the years.
[08:17.08]Like, that's... Hold on, let me get this on here.

[08:53.44]Alright, give me fun levels.
[08:58.44]I don't want to do... And I know what people are writing over here.
[09:05.81]I don't want to do to start the stream central British time.
[09:11.73]You understand?
[09:13.05]No.
[09:24.28]New notifications?
[09:25.74]No.
[09:28.08]I want to disable notifications.
[09:31.26]Alright, so let's go to courses and then...
[09:37.00]Hot new courses?
[09:37.92]Search?
[09:39.74]No, no, no.
[09:41.84]You go to ID, right?
[09:44.28]That's not going to show if I like ID to everybody, right?
[09:48.34]No, okay.
[09:52.01]What are we going to start with?
[09:54.09]By LactorLich, thanks for the $50 and the five community subs.
[09:57.61]And CoreMonster for the community subs, too.

[10:30.96]Find the hidden key 4 for what?
[10:40.17]How many people have tried this?
[10:41.95]20%?
[10:42.11]Not many.
[10:46.89]Alright.
[10:48.09]By the way, I'm doing strict vetoes this stream.
[10:55.84]If I don't... If I'm not... This is not to say that anybody's levels are not good.
[10:59.40]I need to warm up first.
[11:00.70]No, I quit.
[11:03.83]What was this one again?
[11:05.38]I'm not ready.
[11:07.26]I haven't played in like two weeks.
[11:09.20]Okay, no, I'm fine.
[11:11.22]I haven't played Mario in like two and a half weeks.
[11:13.46]Last time I played was the last time you saw me stream it.
[11:15.14]I'm not ready.
[11:15.68]I don't even know the controls to Mario.
[11:26.24]Do I have to find the hidden key?
[11:30.77]Is this a trick?
[11:37.76]This is a trick?
[11:43.04]It's too quiet.
[11:43.72]I don't like how quiet this one is.
[11:50.69]It's silent.
[11:52.59]Oh, no.
[11:54.75]No, you can't just run and jump.
[11:56.11]You have to, like, walk, turn, 180.
[11:59.83]Jump, twist.
[12:00.61]They added a twist.
[12:03.66]Oh, fuck.
[12:04.78]Wait.
[12:11.60]Did the dog just... No, I can't... How do I get over there?
[12:16.74]Am I my toad?
[12:19.86]I don't know.
[12:22.85]I didn't pick this.
[12:23.55]Did I pick this?
[12:26.11]I did pick this, didn't I?
[12:29.77]I think this... Can I pick it up?
[12:33.84]Oh.
[12:40.29]Does that make the door appear?
[12:43.91]Holy shit.
[12:44.73]What happened?
[12:50.22]It's a P door.
[12:50.94]Oh, okay.
[12:52.56]How do I get up there?
[12:53.22]Oh.
[13:00.35]I kind of like this one.
[13:04.79]It's kind of scary, but it's fun.
[13:09.45]This is more of a walker than a runner.
[13:15.58]Anything over here?
[13:22.40]What is that?
[13:22.96]I don't know.
[13:24.14]I don't know!
[13:24.52]I'm gone.
[13:27.80]Ooh!
[13:28.84]That's a checkpoint.
[13:34.24]Whoa!
[13:38.70]By the way, this is going to be a not-angry one.
[13:41.95]I know that if you're watching these streams and you've watched me play Mario Maker like twice before, right now you're just like, oh man, I can't wait till everybody starts to say mean things about video games.
[13:52.59]No.
[13:53.53]I'm in too good of a mood.
[13:54.51]I got a locked-in date of September 21st.
[13:56.37]For that carnival stream.
[14:00.68]Nothing can anger me today.
[14:05.74]It's not going to make me... I'm fine.
[14:13.06]I'm fine.
[14:14.06]I'm doing fine.
[14:14.96]I feel great.
[14:22.70]Nothing's gonna, like, bring me down.
[14:27.92]I should have seen that.
[14:28.74]I thought it was just spikes on the wall.
[14:37.04]You're the best around.
[14:39.36]Thanks.
[14:39.84]Appreciate that.
[14:45.10]Now what?
[14:46.61]Ooh, I didn't even... I have to read this.
[15:06.49]Thank you, DoorCube, for the 250.
[15:07.71]We usually don't read bits like this early here.
[15:12.89]But they said, How did you get the carnival stream off the ground this quick?
[15:17.01]But it's been years since you promised a Noah's Ark toothbrush merch.
[15:23.79]Well, that's easy.
[15:26.45]Because it's impossible to find a company that's going to manufacture custom toothbrushes for you.
[15:33.87]That doesn't exist.
[15:34.55]We're going to call Colgate?
[15:37.47]Dear Colgate, can you make, like, 1,200 toothbrushes for me?
[15:45.76]Or am I gonna buy a bunch of blue toothbrushes over a year from, like, CVS, the ones that have no brand on them, stockpile, like, 5,000 of them, and then just resell them?
[15:59.15]Isn't that- that's illegal!
[16:00.15]Isn't that against the law?
[16:03.51]Oh shit, I'm dead.
[16:05.94]What?
[16:06.38]Ugh.
[16:13.68]Ah, fuck.
[16:14.08]This is gonna be hard.
[16:17.02]Hey, you're the lawyer here.
[16:18.50]Well, I mean, I skimmed it.
[16:21.44]I think that's like... No, no, no, you can, but isn't that like meme?
[16:24.38]Here, let's say I buy a CVS blue toothbrush for a dollar, and then I sell that CVS blue toothbrush for ten dollars.
[16:34.31]There's no, like, government agency that's gonna get involved and go like, hey, these are a dollar.
[16:42.70]What?
[16:44.28]What happened?
[16:47.44]Alright, I gotta be ready for this.
[16:49.91]Drop it.
[16:50.87]Oh, shit.
[16:51.41]I'm dead.
[16:52.19]Yeah, it's guaranteed to lose here.
[16:53.59]Guaranteed.
[16:55.93]I gotta stand up on the...
[17:12.43]Slow down, don't go too fast.
[17:14.27]Oh my god, I went too fast.
[17:17.41]Alright, so I gotta bait the first one, and then jump... over the second one?
[17:22.30]Or just jump from, uh... Hold on.
[17:32.06]Dude, he's livid right now.
[17:33.06]Yeah, so I gotta get this one to drop before it gets over here.
[17:36.54]Same, dude, get it to drop.
[17:37.56]Drop!
[17:37.86]Drop!
[17:38.38]Drop!
[17:39.60]Holy shit, now what?
[17:40.69]Now what do I do?! !
[17:45.29]Oh, fuck.
[17:45.95]Give me a checkpoint.
[17:50.71]Oh, I hate this.
[17:52.87]No checkpoint or anything?
[17:53.79]I don't... Is it safe to fall down here?
[18:04.47]I'm gonna get trolled.
[18:05.31]This is gonna be a... Uh-oh.
[18:09.47]Now... Go over here?
[18:15.50]There's gonna be something on the ceiling.
[18:16.60]I just know there is.
[18:17.40]There's gonna be something in that thing's arm.
[18:22.83]There's not.
[18:25.67]Okay, I just needed to know.
[18:35.07]If I jumped into that, that would've been horrible.
[18:38.46]Slow down.
[18:38.92]If I was a Mario Maker level maker, I would put just something to kill me right there.
[18:44.97]Just for me to walk into.
[18:46.25]I'm this far.
[18:50.37]I don't want to blow it.
[19:05.97]For a second, I thought I was making that music.
[19:11.75]Alright, this is too deliberate to have there not be something wrong here.
[19:20.52]Ah!
[19:20.84]I told you.
[19:21.36]I fucking told you.
[19:22.15]What did I tell you?
[19:22.83]Look.
[19:27.27]Oh shit.
[19:27.71]I probably shouldn't have done that.
[19:43.80]Where are they coming from?
[19:44.46]Where are they coming from?
[19:49.57]Where are the football helmets coming from?
[20:01.43]Oops.
[20:02.11]Should I not have done that?
[20:05.08]Oh, no.
[20:05.64]Okay.
[20:06.34]Should I hit this one too?
[20:08.50]I feel like I should hit this one.
[20:14.37]I can get it.
[20:14.73]No, there's one right here.
[20:17.03]Hit this one, I think.
[20:17.63]I don't know.
[20:22.07]I don't know.
[20:22.43]I don't like this one.
[20:23.17]This one's too... It's very deliberate, and I like just running straight really fast.
[20:33.92]Okay, is that it?
[20:35.66]Don't blow it.
[20:36.12]Okay.
[20:45.61]That needs a... Oh, that needs a key.
[20:46.91]That needs a key.
[20:47.69]Where's the key?
[20:50.49]Oh, please respawn over here.
[20:51.87]Thank God.
[20:53.75]Wait, what?
[20:57.70]What?
[20:58.48]I did it.
[20:58.78]I don't... I did it.
[21:07.62]Okay.
[21:13.19]Key for the true ending.
[21:14.15]I don't get true endings.
[21:22.76]That was fun.
[21:24.34]That was a little scary.
[21:27.72]Wasn't it?
[21:28.40]Alright, we'll grab this one.
[21:38.61]This level... This level was made for fun and not to be mean to you.
[21:43.04]Alright, well, what is the over-under that this is mean to me?
[21:45.50]I wonder.
[21:49.78]Hey, I promise this level was not made to be mean to you.
[21:53.56]Why do you have to say that?
[21:56.70]Why can't you just, you know, hey, here's a level, man, check it out.
[22:07.78]Oh, maybe he doesn't know you, Pepeface.
[22:12.14]Uh, alright, four minutes, Fireflower Skies 1-1.
[22:19.30]Okay.
[22:20.18]I'll try it.
[22:24.10]It's gonna be a Jerma short spelled in blocks.
[22:33.02]It's too hard.
[22:33.67]Just kidding.
[22:38.43]Alright, well, I gotta, I gotta, um, that's good.
[22:42.91]I gotta go for the guy with the stereo.
[22:48.87]Turn this way.
[22:51.47]Alright, got it.
[22:55.07]Bingo!
[22:59.96]Shit, it's a guy.
[23:01.66]Ooh, I can get up there and get that 50.
[23:07.73]I gotta get two.
[23:11.67]Come on.
[23:14.51]They weren't lying.
[23:15.11]This is a fun one.
[23:17.95]You're playing to my, like, addicting shit that I do.
[23:22.89]Okay, no, it's not worth it.
[23:26.08]Am I going to die if this goes down all the way?
[23:33.12]I thought that was going to just kill me.
[23:36.86]Alright, give me one.
[23:38.03]I need to knock this guy out.
[23:45.75]Ooh, how do I get the key?
[23:48.10]Uh-oh.
[23:49.26]This is gonna be tough.
[23:52.50]Uh... What?
[23:57.13]Feels good when you get a nice string.
[24:11.62]When you get a nice volley back and forth.
[24:13.96]What, can I bring one of you?
[24:21.49]Oh my god.
[24:25.99]Shit.
[24:26.85]It's alright.
[24:32.66]Too much weight.
[24:33.84]That's not it, is it?
[24:35.76]Is there weight in Mario?
[24:43.68]There's definitely not weight.
[24:48.86]Oh my god!
[24:49.80]No!
[24:52.43]You got me fucked me up with the whole weight comment.
[24:55.13]I'm trying to like jump lighter because like maybe I weigh more This didn't have like weight classes in this toad is totes to be told is like shorter and fatter I
[25:22.46]How did I get over there the first time?
[25:32.44]Toad has good acceleration, but bad turning?
[25:37.08]Is he a fucking car?
[25:39.96]What are you talking about?
[25:43.33]Wait, what?
[25:46.23]That's not real.
[25:55.14]Yeah, Mario's got really good handling.
[25:57.34]But his brakes are always, like, kind of shitty.
[25:59.52]Alright, get me up there.
[26:07.05]He's automatic.
[26:09.35]I'm just gonna carry this.
[26:12.87]Get out!
[26:13.71]Okay, alright.
[26:15.06]Excuse me, what happened there?
[26:17.98]Did he escape from my grasp?
[26:24.43]I have to go like this.
[26:31.04]No, I don't.
[26:31.52]Okay.
[26:34.68]Um... Uh-oh.
[26:41.65]Why did I do that?
[26:48.66]Do I have to go down?
[26:49.36]Okay, I gotta go down.
[26:53.08]Holy shit.
[26:53.82]Okay, I got it.
[26:54.24]Give me that spring.

[27:03.41]I thought that was a hole.

[27:52.65]I'm playing Super Mario.
[27:56.21]Wait a minute.
[27:56.77]Is there a secret?
[27:57.73]If I can jump up there?
[28:02.90]Why am I storing them?
[28:04.88]This is bad.
[28:05.50]Why did I do that?
[28:14.60]Uh-oh.

[28:19.58]Oh my god, why is my thumb so cold?
[28:23.02]Okay, I might have to do like a few push-ups.
[28:24.56]I'm not kidding.
[28:26.04]I guess I have blood in my hands.
[28:27.54]I'm telling you.
[28:40.29]I have to get blood in my hand.
[28:48.40]My hands are turning into ice.
[28:49.70]Oh, I'm gonna fall.
[28:51.82]Stop laughing.
[28:58.97]Well, okay, I know that's there.

[29:14.16]Every time I move my fingers, like, I hear, like, crack, and my fans crack.
[29:19.49]Fuck.
[29:24.53]This happens to me sometimes.
[29:25.45]Does this happen to anybody else?
[29:27.79]I get, like, bad circulation in my hands.
[29:31.47]Oh my god, I'm gonna fucking not get angry, because nothing's gonna make me angry today.
[29:41.83]Nothing's gonna make me mad today.
[29:44.77]You know what today is?
[29:49.65]September 21st.
[29:50.13]Well, today's not, that's not what today's date is.

[30:56.05]Alright, I'm not gonna even go that way.
[30:57.33]What's the point?
[30:57.77]To get the secret true ending?
[30:59.81]We don't get true endings on this stream.
[31:02.85]A lot of you know that by now.
[31:06.17]Hold on a minute here.
[31:09.62]This is interesting.
[31:13.54]I guess I'm gonna go this way?
[31:21.20]Ooh, alright.

[31:23.51]What's over here?
[31:27.25]I only get bad endings?
[31:28.23]That's not true.
[31:29.61]I'm gonna wait for another one.

[46:07.99]Just fucking go over here.
[46:12.03]Alright.
[46:14.11]Spit it out!
[46:23.33]What does that do for me if I do that?
[46:27.45]What does this do?
[46:29.70]Okay, easy.
[46:30.62]It's slippery.
[46:33.44]Does this drop down?
[46:38.37]Where does this go?
[46:52.02]That was the top, right?
[47:00.57]So I can walk around it.
[47:03.17]I get it.
[47:04.69]This is a good one.
[47:08.81]I like this one.
[47:09.29]This is a good one.
[47:11.29]Who made this?
[47:11.83]Isaac.
[47:23.09]So now I can go underneath, right?
[47:31.44]Um!
[47:32.42]Get out of here!
[47:32.94]Fuck!
[47:38.15]Hold on, wait!
[47:40.51]How do I get out from under this?
[47:43.49]Oh no, I'm just like those two!
[47:45.05]They must have done the same thing!
[47:55.15]You know, I'm so focused on... Can I just jump over the top of this?
[48:00.61]Alright, how do I die?
[48:05.72]How do I die?
[48:17.83]Bombs can break the wooden blocks.
[48:19.47]Oh god, give me a break.
[48:21.85]Um...
[48:23.88]What do you guys want to do for 200 seconds?
[48:25.50]Because I'm not starting over.
[48:29.38]Wait, hold on!
[48:47.89]Is this synced up?
[48:52.27]Let's do a test.
[48:52.77]Ready?
[49:01.29]How about this, ready?
[49:01.81]Like... You should be hearing like... Is that synced?
[49:04.74]Is it?
[49:06.64]Okay, good.
[49:07.48]Let's see if I can do like a beat.
[49:31.80]It's too hard to do with these buttons.
[49:32.90]Faster.
[49:34.10]I wonder how fast I can do it.
[50:03.63]This is what it's like to be in, like, jail here.
[50:07.73]Just comb my hair for a little bit.
[50:09.31]I can't hit the start button.
[50:10.68]I'm sorry.
[50:13.04]Just die?
[50:13.54]I can't die.
[50:14.18]If I die, I start at the beginning.
[50:22.78]Erasable pen erasers to do fast on the buttons.
[50:26.24]I've never heard of that technique.
[50:28.42]You can restart it without losing progress.
[50:30.96]Are you serious?
[50:32.04]No, I can't.
[50:35.68]No, I definitely can't.
[50:45.87]Come on, hurry up!
[51:17.06]Just tell a joke.
[51:17.98]What do you want me to say?
[51:20.52]What joke do I have right now?
[51:22.58]Besides, I can't leave the level and I can't die.
[51:27.64]What am I supposed to say?
[51:28.62]Alright, do a job.
[51:35.30]Alright, I... Let me... I'm an observational... Comedyist, so... Let me...
[51:45.28]We got two turnip people, right?
[51:48.06]Is there ice underneath us?
[51:53.27]I'm stuck in between here.
[51:55.53]What's an observation that I can say about this?
[51:59.69]There's nothing.
[52:01.09]There's nothing to say.
[52:04.03]I'm just inside of the... I'm soft-locked in the game.
[52:08.66]I have nothing to say.
[52:12.12]I got it right at zero.
[52:20.31]We're hemorrhaging viewers.
[52:21.93]It's alright.
[52:22.47]They'll be back right now.
[52:23.53]Ready?
[52:24.41]Once I beat this first try.
[52:25.79]3, 2, 1, go.
[52:33.24]I told you they'll look!
[52:34.06]They're back already!
[52:35.48]They're already here.
[52:57.22]Come on, blow up!
[52:59.86]Oh, nice!
[53:00.48]Anything up here?
[53:13.11]How do I get up there?
[53:13.69]Okay, I'm good.
[53:16.31]See, they're back!
[53:17.19]Look, we just went up by like eight viewers.
[53:18.92]Those eight people came back.
[53:26.99]Checkpoint.
[53:28.41]Yes.
[53:29.42]We're good.
[53:34.48]That's what you gotta do.
[53:35.50]Oops.
[53:35.76]Uh, oops.
[53:57.43]Ooh, watch out.
[53:58.09]Okay, we're good.
[54:00.03]This is a long one, but this one doesn't feel long.
[54:02.49]It feels like it was very well thought of.
[54:06.33]And... What am I supposed to do about this?
[54:10.31]Will he go up if I jump?
[54:15.17]Uh, kind of.
[54:15.79]Oh, right, I forgot this is Mario.
[54:20.14]Okay.
[54:26.51]He doesn't know.
[54:27.11]He doesn't even know.
[54:30.01]Oh my god, he doesn't know.
[54:33.91]Yes, I do.
[54:34.47]I know everything.
[54:43.04]Do the Peter Griffin laugh.
[54:48.80]Why on Earth would I do that right now?
[55:03.58]There it is!
[55:04.06]I'm not gonna do the Peter Griffin laugh.
[55:17.23]That was a good... good level.
[55:29.28]1% completion rate.
[55:30.24]Is that me doing all those attempts?
[55:32.00]No, it's not.
[55:37.26]I need the Peter... I can't even do a Peter Griffin laugh.
[55:47.16]Pick this one.
[55:47.82]Pick this one.
[55:48.30]This one.
[55:48.64]This one.
[55:48.94]This one.
[55:51.61]Try my level.
[55:53.07]You got it.
[55:54.13]Do this one.
[55:54.67]M0430R?
[56:07.93]9th.
[56:14.56]Uh-oh.
[56:18.62]Did I do that wrong?
[56:23.20]Was it an O instead of a 0?
[56:36.00]What just happened?
[56:40.84]It was a fucking prank level?
[56:42.22]Are you serious?
[56:44.56]I don't even... Why?
[56:46.82]What?
[56:53.12]How would that be a prank level?
[56:54.28]That says, like... Moth?
[56:59.64]I don't understand.
[57:06.32]Oh my god, please, why?
[57:07.68]Alright, I'm doing this one.
[57:13.62]Except for real shit, by the way.
[57:15.22]I don't want to put it in your fucking joke code.
[57:24.05]No joke codes.
[57:25.65]Is this a joke code?
[57:29.27]No, it's not.
[57:30.85]Lied to Pinwheel.
[57:35.24]A lot of swinging.
[57:35.88]Also, watch your jumps.
[57:37.14]Good luck.
[57:42.28]Alright, let's do it.
[57:47.19]I mean, it's not a joke code, but it might be a joke level.
[57:50.39]It's an auto-scroller, too.
[57:56.71]Oh, it's Pinwheels.
[57:58.13]I get it.
[57:58.55]Ooh, the top!
[58:12.43]I didn't even pay attention to the top.
[58:14.23]Sorry.
[58:19.10]Oh, I didn't... How did I not... What's going on?
[58:21.94]What is going on with my fucking hands?
[58:26.14]Why did I... I'm trying to jump off the damn thing.
[58:29.55]Nothing's gonna make me angry today.
[58:45.02]Oh my god, just damage boost through the whole thing.
[58:48.30]I'm just gonna damage boost through the whole thing next time too.
[58:52.56]Don't go too high.
[59:00.52]Oh no.
[59:03.90]How am I gonna... Alright, invent, yeah, damage frames.
[59:13.62]Let's go.
[59:17.35]You get a mushroom over there anyways.
[59:18.43]Ah!
[59:22.41]Not fast enough.
[59:26.53]Not fast enough, apparently.
[59:35.27]Hey, by the way, did I tell you?
[59:37.27]September 21st.
[59:37.89]Put the date on your calendar.
[59:47.81]Why?
[59:48.45]What?
[59:51.37]Is there like a syncing issue here with the wireless controller here?
[59:55.28]What?
[59:55.58]I don't get it.
[59:57.16]Alright, just go.
[60:20.44]Yeah, we talked about this last time, on the last Mario Maker stream.
[60:24.59]But, the easiest way to make any streamer really, really, like, upset and mad and annoyed is telling them that, like, when they're losing, like, stop pretending.
[60:38.08]It's like, even though I know you're fucking around, like, it's like, I'm not pretending.
[60:44.54]It's like, oh, he has to be pretending.
[60:45.96]He can't be this, like, stupid.
[60:50.13]That's like the... Every... I don't care who they are.
[60:53.86]Every single streamer on Twitch, when they see that phrase, what is he pretending again?
[61:02.10]Is like, hey, I'm not pretending.
[61:05.49]It doesn't matter if it's fake.
[61:12.67]Alright, let's go this way.
[61:17.82]No, that's just a coin over there, right?
[61:22.25]That was not worth it, because how the hell am I going to get back?
[61:32.31]Just go up?
[61:32.85]I don't know if I can do that from here.
[61:35.66]Go across?
[61:36.42]Oh, man.
[61:44.94]Okay, that was pretty cool.
[61:47.30]Ah!
[61:49.13]Alright, I don't know why I thought that was going to stop.
[61:53.89]Points.
[62:16.84]Okay, so I know where to go from here.
[62:21.62]Can I even do this while being big?
[62:25.21]It's harder.
[62:29.87]Can I have somebody in the chat explain to me why that didn't catch twice?
[62:32.47]I didn't do anything.
[62:38.90]Why did it not catch?
[62:42.64]Is it because I was invincible?
[62:45.16]No, I clearly was in there.
[62:47.50]Can you not get grabbed when you're invincible?
[63:04.48]It's alright.
[63:05.16]It's alright.
[63:05.46]I want to be small anyways.
[63:07.76]What was that?
[63:08.99]I had no momentum.
[63:21.69]I do like this one, though.
[63:22.48]We're good.
[63:30.22]Alright, so it's gonna be tough to actually jump over this thing.
[63:41.25]I got it, okay.
[63:41.65]And then up and then over.
[63:49.37]And then from here... Ooh, too tall.
[63:53.93]Watch it.
[63:54.49]Okay, this is this part.
[64:06.20]Uh, fire down there.
[64:07.50]I think I have to run across this.
[64:15.36]I need a running start.
[64:23.97]I did it!
[64:25.97]Cool!
[64:30.89]Oh, yeah, yeah, I... Oh, it's the auto-scroll portion.
[64:34.93]Uh... Alright, I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go right.
[64:47.00]Left side?
[64:48.34]I like how there's two different ways to go.
[64:50.44]Oh, come on.
[64:52.58]I don't know where I am.
[65:01.92]I really probably needed that.
[65:02.76]Uh-oh.
[65:13.10]Uh-oh.
[65:13.83]Thank god I got it correct.
[65:16.83]And then up?
[65:18.01]Let's see.
[65:19.27]It's up and then right.
[65:23.09]What about this one?
[65:29.38]Ooh, easy.
[65:33.12]Which way?
[65:33.62]Which way do I need to be?
[65:34.40]I don't know.
[65:35.92]I have to take a guess.
[65:37.52]Uh, I went right last time.
[65:39.00]We're gonna go left.
[65:40.44]Got it right.
[66:01.15]Okay, I'm fine can I are those platforms or are they?
[66:09.57]Hold on Oh
[66:22.24]Oh no, not another one of these.
[66:23.54]Another one of these.
[66:25.24]Where is it going?
[66:26.74]Oh, fuck.
[66:27.58]Okay, hold on.
[66:28.94]I just panicked.
[66:35.82]Is there another one firing on anywhere?
[66:37.28]Where's the other one?
[66:38.70]There's one right here!
[66:41.76]Which way?
[66:42.12]Is there anything up?
[66:44.93]Still?
[66:45.25]Nope, go.
[66:49.15]Oh, please.
[66:51.31]Okay.
[66:53.54]What?
[66:54.36]No.
[66:55.84]Oh god, no.
[66:57.44]I have to jump this?
[66:58.32]Let me take a look at what it looks like.
[67:00.32]It's just... I need to jump from where that coin is.
[67:03.02]That's definitely what it means.
[67:04.50]Run?
[67:04.94]Jump at this platform across.
[67:13.02]Hold your breath!
[67:15.70]Oh!
[67:15.98]Okay.
[67:18.06]And then... Oh, shit.
[67:19.96]I think I need the momentum here.
[67:21.62]I need to do a jump-jump, don't I?
[67:22.72]I'm not gonna make that.
[67:28.10]I need to be going as fast with that first jump.
[67:30.56]Shit.
[67:35.07]Okay.
[67:37.83]Up?
[67:38.73]I think I'm gonna go up.
[67:40.33]Watch out for the saw!
[67:42.41]Oh, god.
[67:43.09]Come on.
[67:44.23]No, there's only, like, a coin up here.
[67:45.89]I don't want to go up here anymore.
[67:49.79]I don't wanna go up here anymore.
[67:51.81]No.
[67:52.45]I don't wanna do this hard jump!
[67:54.43]I need to- I'm dead.
[67:59.54]I think it's peak of that jump.
[68:03.60]Holy shit!
[68:04.22]I'm okay.
[68:06.30]And then- but how do I get over this one?
[68:07.42]I'm gonna hit it, aren't I?
[68:08.24]Does this move?
[68:14.04]Does this move?
[68:14.50]Does anyone know if that moves?
[68:18.97]If this is going to come up, I'm terrified.
[68:21.09]Did they come up?
[68:26.43]I did it.
[68:27.23]Game over.
[68:28.53]That was fun.
[68:36.98]Can I breathe now?
[68:37.64]Yes, you can.
[68:40.54]Let's give that one a... Nice job.
[68:47.92]He stopped pretending.
[68:48.94]Sometimes you gotta pretend.
[68:54.44]What an actor.
[68:54.97]Uh, you won't pick this one.
[69:00.45]Um, yes I will.
[69:01.31]What's going on here?
[69:14.23]Uh oh, people are starting to understand how to game my brain.
[69:20.84]You have to just put a sad face.
[69:24.26]I have the last two or three that I've done have been, you're not going to play mine with a sad face.
[69:32.58]And I'm like, yeah, I will.
[69:33.41]Of course I will.
[69:34.23]Here you go, man.
[69:36.85]This is called Monty's Symbiosis.
[69:39.39]Monty balls have teamed up with piranha plants.
[69:41.11]Show evolution who's boss.
[69:42.33]You can do this apparently in a minute.
[69:48.77]Okay.
[69:59.14]Is this a hard one?
[70:02.18]This is World 1-1.
[70:02.90]Ooh, alright, hold on.
[70:08.67]Is there a mushroom?
[70:09.43]Is he gonna hurt me?
[70:18.63]Well, that's an easy 10 points.
[70:22.08]What's in here?
[70:23.16]Alright, oh.
[70:23.82]Just getting all the secrets in this one.
[70:31.28]Jerma's not gonna admin me.
[70:33.38]No, I'm not.
[70:35.99]Oh shit, you just like can't be on the ground.
[70:37.71]Oh, this is gonna be terrible.
[70:44.21]Okay.
[70:48.86]Watch out for those hidden blocks.
[71:03.88]Just don't touch the ground.
[71:05.10]It's the name of the game.
[71:10.54]I can touch the ground for a second.
[71:13.03]Okay, I know there's one right here now, so that's good.
[71:15.33]I don't have to sit there and freak out about mushrooms.
[71:25.29]That hitbox was dog shit, I will tell you.
[71:30.13]Up!
[71:32.65]I feel like I want to get in there.
[71:42.81]No.
[71:45.43]Fireballs?
[71:50.23]Oh god, okay, they come out.
[71:51.80]Give me that, please!
[71:55.18]Uh, wait.
[71:55.92]Come back.
[71:56.78]Come back, come back, come back, come back, come back!
[71:59.40]Come- It'll be back eventually, don't worry.
[72:02.56]I'm- No, no, no, connect that, because that needs to come back.
[72:08.07]I need- Whatever this is, I want it.
[72:09.75]It's not coming back, is it?
[72:12.25]Yeah, I can die faster than it will come back.
[72:32.17]No.
[72:32.61]Why would that vine be there?
[72:34.01]I thought it was gonna go up somewhere.
[72:35.53]Alright, now switch it.
[72:45.49]Watch out for the fire.
[72:48.85]Do they all have fire?
[72:51.57]Is that gonna... Just don't move.
[72:55.52]Uh-oh.
[72:58.54]Uh-oh.
[73:01.10]Don't move.
[73:04.23]Oh, okay.
[73:09.37]What?!
[73:09.63]I... Damage boost through the whole thing!
[73:22.48]I don't know why I wanted to do that so bad, but I had to.
[73:24.61]I win.
[73:29.21]That was a good one.
[73:38.51]I didn't see them.
[73:39.77]They blended the fuck in real good.
[73:42.91]I was not paying attention to that.
[73:45.45]He's not... Whatever.
[73:47.64]I'm telling you right now, that was legitimate.
[73:51.18]I thought they were grass.
[73:54.28]I thought they were grass. ...
[74:09.92]I have to jump!
[74:11.88]No, it's gonna hit me!
[74:12.62]It's gonna double tap me!
[74:13.96]Stop!
[74:14.30]Ooh!
[74:15.64]Alright, I'm fine.
[74:20.80]Jump over the grass.
[74:22.10]Wait.
[74:22.36]I could... No, I don't care.
[74:35.03]That probably was a block.
[74:36.73]No true endings.
[74:38.07]Only bad endings here, guys.
[74:41.12]That was a fun one.
[74:44.06]Nice.
[74:45.33]Good level.
[74:48.35]You are going to play this one.
[74:50.01]Yes, I am.
[74:51.23]Yes, I will play this one.
[74:53.66]Make sure it's not like a... Pooh P2!
[74:55.54]Pooh!
[75:13.45]Maneuvering Bob-ombs.
[75:15.07]This is new.
[75:18.77]No one's played this one in the world, probably besides me.
[75:20.67]And it's a puzzle level, so I'm gonna have a lot of fun with this one.
[75:28.54]For a second, I thought my intro was still playing in the background.
[75:30.58]I was like, how the hell did nobody tell me this yet?
[75:35.22]Alright, obviously need the bomb.
[75:41.83]to explode this guy now we need the bomb to hit the switch yep okay and we have to have you come down take the bomb with us over here alright there's more bombs so we got to do put the bomb up there
[76:04.97]And it's gotta hit it.
[76:05.77]Hit the switch.
[76:07.37]That was a little too early.
[76:09.53]Might still do it.
[76:10.87]No.
[76:11.37]Oh, you got... Hold on.
[76:11.99]One.
[76:12.85]Two.
[76:13.81]Three.
[76:14.81]Four.
[76:15.81]Five.
[76:16.31]Okay, it's been five seconds.
[76:17.43]How long... One.
[76:19.01]Two.
[76:19.83]So in three seconds, I have to get it over there.
[76:23.52]So here we go.
[76:24.12]One.
[76:25.02]Two.
[76:25.88]Three.
[76:26.50]One.
[76:27.44]Law!
[76:28.02]Ugh, come on.
[76:35.72]One.
[76:36.54]Two.
[76:37.42]Three.
[76:38.24]No, stop at that one.
[76:39.72]Two.
[76:40.72]Three.
[76:44.39]One.
[76:45.53]Two.
[76:54.13]One.
[76:55.13]Two.
[76:56.07]Three.
[76:56.67]One.
[76:57.60]Two.
[76:58.72]What?! !
[77:12.50]Did I use them all?
[77:29.91]He's baiting help donations.
[77:33.39]I don't have, like, text to speech on.
[77:36.37]If anything, like, a help donation would be worse, because I have to look over here.
[77:46.88]And now what?
[77:48.04]Hold on.
[77:48.42]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[77:48.90]What do I have to... You motherfucker.
[77:52.14]I didn't think two more than two could be out at one time.
[78:00.00]I thought like only two could be out at one time.
[78:01.78]Remember?
[78:01.98]Because it was... That's gonna hit me.
[78:07.37]It's gonna hit me still.
[78:16.40]Get up there, hurry!
[78:17.96]I like this one.
[78:20.10]What are you thinking?
[78:24.34]Pretending to be, like, mad for donations.
[78:29.06]I don't get it!
[78:29.70]I don't understand!
[78:31.23]What are you talking about?
[78:33.77]Somebody donate and, like, tell me.
[78:35.19]I don't get it.
[78:43.49]I'm so stupid.
[78:48.41]Talking about donations is baiting donations.
[78:52.71]Don't you know?
[78:53.13]Even if you say the word donation... I need to have, like, banned words as a streamer.
[79:02.77]Donation Prime.
[79:04.37]Why did I do that?
[79:15.27]No, no!
[79:15.47]It's gonna kill it!
[79:17.53]It's a key!
[79:28.60]See what I'm talking about?
[79:30.00]I can't say those words.
[79:31.60]I cannot say the word prime.
[79:33.64]I can't say it.
[79:35.62]Because Herbert just gave 25 subs.
[79:37.88]Holy shit.
[79:38.74]You see what I'm saying?
[79:45.15]That's a lot of subs.
[79:46.29]Thank you, Herbert.
[79:46.91]That's fucking too many.
[79:49.35]And then LaCrona just gave $65.
[79:51.11]Do you understand?
[79:54.45]I can't say the word money on stream.
[79:58.65]Lecronda, thanks for the 65 bucks and Herbert for the 25 subs.
[80:01.39]Greedy streamer sucks money out of wallet of innocent streamer.
[80:08.48]Okay, I'm never going to say the word money again on stream.
[80:12.60]Anytime I want, I'm going to talk about, like, capital.
[80:15.92]Or... Um... Paper trading goods.
[80:21.56]That's what I'm going to say.
[80:24.08]Monthly paper trading goods subscription.
[80:31.37]Alright, so I need to stop that from coming down, but it kills it.
[80:40.05]Hmm.
[80:41.78]It's got to be there long enough for it to explode.
[80:43.66]Alright, so hold on.
[80:44.10]Ready?
[80:44.96]Go.
[80:47.78]No, what?
[80:50.34]Why did it not stay on top of it?
[80:55.46]It can't.
[80:58.53]Ban the word pretending.
[81:03.80]That's not reaching it?
[81:08.72]It looks like it's reaching it.
[81:18.72]Fuck!
[81:19.66]It's the whole- I'm not acting!
[81:21.98]Yes I am, I'm a fucking actor.
[81:28.47]This is a puzzle one, you're not supposed to beat this one quick.
[81:37.40]How long does it take us to travel over there?
[81:38.60]You have to go, like... No.
[81:49.27]No.
[81:49.61]Way earlier than that.
[81:57.75]Finally.
[81:58.17]Jesus.
[82:00.47]Now what?
[82:02.83]Ooh, that hurts.
[82:04.80]Oh, you gotta crane this.
[82:05.94]Come on, over here.
[82:08.04]Drop it.
[82:08.44]Holy shit, this is going to be horrible.
[82:10.06]Alright, stay over here.
[82:10.76]Can I just throw it in?
[82:22.48]There's too many of them.
[82:24.60]This whole thing is going to get messed up here.
[82:26.74]I can't go over here.
[82:28.14]I can no longer jump over here.
[82:29.70]What do I do?
[82:31.06]What do I do about this?
[82:33.12]There's too many.
[82:43.17]Shit.
[82:47.07]How many do you think I can have over here?
[82:48.54]I'm not playing that game right now.
[82:50.04]I'm playing the try to win.
[82:51.24]I don't like how they come out so fast.
[82:58.02]Alright.
[83:01.88]This next mod I'm gonna try.
[83:03.30]Come here.
[83:03.64]Ready?
[83:05.40]I should get it now?
[83:09.73]Get it!
[83:10.63]Drop it over here, quick!
[83:11.59]Oh, come on.
[83:13.29]That was the one.
[83:15.35]You gotta get it when it's on its way this way.
[83:19.19]Get it!
[83:19.51]Ugh.
[83:22.95]Like, how far does it go?
[83:26.06]Easy.
[83:37.25]No!
[83:39.57]Please!
[83:40.33]Okay.

[83:43.79]No.
[83:55.45]No.
[83:58.82]YouTuber scream?
[83:59.52]That was a gasping for air.
[84:00.88]I didn't scream.
[84:08.19]Oh my god, please!
[84:08.91]Alright, wait.
[84:12.51]Grab it.
[84:14.15]No.
[84:17.67]Drop it!
[84:19.55]Yeah.
[84:23.98]Oh my god, please, mom.
[84:42.07]I have to, like, push down the... What am I supposed to do?
[84:45.45]Put the helmet on!
[84:49.39]Can I pick it up?
[85:08.22]I can't pick it up.
[85:28.22]Do I have to bounce it with my head?
[85:29.92]Oh my- okay, well... I didn't even know that- okay.
[85:48.49]I- I- this is like the second time I've played Mario Maker in like three weeks.
[85:51.79]I don't- I don't know you can do this shit.
[85:54.92]I thought I was just gonna go duke and explode.
[86:03.30]Oops.
[86:14.25]Fuck.
[86:15.19]It's actually kind of hard.
[86:16.69]Oh no, give me another one.
[86:21.88]Oh, come on, no.
[86:26.60]You said you knew everything.
[86:27.94]Nobody can know everything.
[86:34.30]I'm facing the right side!
[86:36.41]I'm facing to the right!
[86:38.19]Did we die already?
[86:52.13]More than three.
[86:54.43]Interesting.
[87:02.30]Oh my god.
[87:02.96]Fuck off.
[87:10.73]four more than five times it's not gonna be eight
[87:34.26]Oh my god, fuck me.
[87:35.88]Why?
[87:36.16]No, don't.
[87:37.12]Please.
[87:37.56]I don't want to do this again.
[87:39.67]I really- I don't want to do this again.
[87:56.32]Oh fuck.
[87:56.78]Die.
[87:58.76]Guys.
[88:00.44]What's going on here?
[88:14.90]Does this end?
[88:17.56]Give that to me.
[88:24.78]Oh my god, this thing's gonna explode!
[88:30.21]That was a scream.
[88:31.49]That was a scream.
[88:32.41]Yes, you can say I screamed.
[88:33.51]Because I did.
[88:34.57]That was an actual scream.
[88:37.37]Thank god.
[88:37.91]Get me out of here.
[88:45.83]Excuse me.
[88:48.79]I really don't want to do that eight more times, so I hope I don't die.
[88:51.33]No, I got it.
[89:00.90]Hey, I'm like five for five right now.
[89:05.18]That's pretty- I've beaten every level that it's come across.
[89:07.32]I haven't vetoed any yet.
[89:16.08]Uh, 50 more dollars came in.
[89:20.36]From anotherfan321.
[89:21.42]Thank you for the 50 dollars.
[89:27.02]Uh, I'm a dirty YouTube archive watcher.
[89:29.14]I'm still catching up on your stuff since you stream so often.
[89:32.30]But it is my dream for you to play one of my levels.
[89:34.62]And they put their level here.
[89:42.69]Nobody in chat beat this?
[89:45.89]Bribery?
[89:53.62]Well, thank you for the $50, and I'm gonna play your level.
[89:57.18]I am.
[89:57.60]I just, what do you want me to say?
[90:00.20]Guys, give me a break.
[90:04.23]That was fun.
[90:07.29]You got bribed and sweet-talked.
[90:08.79]It's really not that hard to make me do something.
[90:13.17]Well, I mean, that's a lot of money.
[90:15.47]That is hard.
[90:17.49]That's a ton of fucking money.
[90:18.41]You don't have to pay me money to play your level.
[90:20.07]But, like, I just saw it.
[90:21.80]Don't worry, we're gonna be here for a while.
[90:30.78]Don't worry.
[90:42.76]uh bound across bumpers bounce across the desert jump right as you soon as you land to get extra height 28 seconds short and sweet alright
[91:13.04]Less than 20 seconds?
[91:13.90]Ooh, it's the bumpers.
[91:21.31]I have a reasonable explanation as to how that happened.
[91:30.03]I started to burp.
[91:31.58]Like, I could feel the burp coming out of my stomach.
[91:33.30]And I stopped for a second and just... That's a very reasonable explanation.
[91:41.44]Uh-oh, not enough.
[91:45.45]I'm not pretending.
[91:46.85]That looked very much like somebody was pretending, but they weren't.
[91:51.09]I promise.
[91:52.42]That looked like it could have... It looked like I just walked into the hole.
[91:55.62]Like, oh shit, I fell down, but I missed going through the hole, but let me just, like, nudge to the left a little.
[92:01.24]Ow, I fell down!
[92:03.76]But I can assure you, that's not what happened.
[92:08.64]How do I get in there?
[92:10.22]Oh, that's how.
[92:10.78]I like this one.
[92:11.42]This one's nice and, like, cool.
[92:27.85]Mario 3.
[92:28.29]The best Mario that nobody plays.
[92:33.68]And what I mean by that is most people that play Mario 3 play the first two or three levels and then skip to the end of the game.
[92:42.74]Every time.
[92:44.38]Oops.
[92:52.93]It's a great game, though.
[93:08.37]Alright, bounce.
[93:10.43]Oh my god, what the fuck am I doing?
[93:17.47]It's a different Mario.
[93:18.31]It's a different style.
[93:18.99]That's why.
[93:19.35]I've been playing... What was I on before?
[93:22.48]I was playing a different Mario before.
[93:24.40]It's a different style.
[93:25.14]It's a different weight.
[93:48.19]That's a far away... Oh no, am I in trouble?
[93:56.98]Why am I commentating over a 10 year old's gameplay of Mario?
[94:00.23]I don't know, I figured it would be an easy stream, you know?
[94:06.53]Pretty easy.
[94:20.33]Somebody can do that in 28 seconds.
[94:22.23]Well, that was, that was fun.
[94:23.39]That was a fun, just little level.
[94:25.83]It was fun to play.
[94:26.93]Thank you for that level.
[94:27.55]That was another fan.
[94:28.15]Alright.
[94:31.21]Alright.
[94:31.45]Alright.
[94:31.67]Come on.
[94:31.89]Come on.
[94:32.15]Come on.
[94:32.39]Come on.
[94:32.61]Come on.
[94:37.00]Uh, this is says, this one says easy, fun hand warmer.
[94:39.78]I don't know what that means.
[94:41.68]Oh, right.
[94:41.98]Because my hands.
[94:45.74]And then, uh, we'll do... Slime, we'll do your level right after.
[94:50.30]B-M-L-L-1-M... Whoa.
[95:08.01]Is that a zero?
[95:15.78]Alright, uh, Mechanism Mine.
[95:17.22]Go through mine with a fair amount of traps.
[95:21.32]Okay.
[95:22.04]Puzzle solving.
[95:23.00]Standard length.
[95:25.50]How much money do I have to pay you to play my level?
[95:28.16]There is no amount of money that I will take to play a level.
[95:30.30]I just do- I just do it if it's- if I see it.
[95:33.17]There's no- you don't have to pay me to play a level.
[95:35.41]This is the worst Mario ever.
[95:36.99]This is the worst one.
[95:37.99]So, I already don't like this one.
[95:39.45]It's the one that has this.
[95:53.15]He's literally the best Mario.
[95:56.81]I'm just kidding, guys.
[95:58.59]My god.
[95:59.73]I don't need to make a Dark Souls- Soulsborne tier list of Mario games.
[96:04.67]Although, might as well.
[96:05.81]Aww. 50.
[96:21.31]Look, they're all pretty fun.
[96:24.11]All the Mario games are fun.
[96:25.53]They're fun games.
[96:27.59]They've lasted, like, 60 years.
[96:34.81]I can't really think of another product that's been around for that long.
[96:38.25]That people still like.
[96:39.09]What?

[97:41.20]Go ahead and do this again.
[97:48.38]Oh, why have you done that?
[97:56.07]Just step on the damn thing.
[97:57.15]Um...
[98:12.60]I guess I'm just going to go up?
[98:15.96]If TV is so good, why don't we have TV 2?
[98:17.64]I mean, you're on TV 2 right now.
[98:23.01]Can I?
[98:23.57]Oh.
[98:43.84]This one's pretty cool.
[98:45.46]Uh... But, how does... What?
[98:48.52]B block?
[98:48.94]That one... That one...
[99:14.57]What's going on here?
[99:15.23]There's no... key block?
[99:24.62]Thought I had it.
[99:26.46]What the fuck is happening?
[99:29.92]What?
[99:38.75]Did I mess it all up back here?
[99:43.43]Am I missing something?
[99:45.31]No, that's up here.
[99:46.97]Hold on.
[99:47.41]Is there a P block available?
[100:11.32]Oh, then it has to grab that.
[100:13.04]Okay.
[100:14.95]I think I screwed it all up, though, didn't I?
[100:16.49]There's no more coins, right?
[100:19.11]Yeah, I think I blew it.
[100:20.45]I blew it.
[100:21.17]Uh-oh.
[100:44.12]I'm telling you, I swear to God, people think I'm making this shit up.
[100:47.90]But sometimes when you press a button on the Switch controller, it just like doesn't happen.
[100:53.65]It's like a phantom button press.
[100:55.43]I promise.
[101:14.69]Alright, I'll get it this time.
[101:16.83]I-I, you know... I'm already back down here.
[101:28.48]It's like it never happened.
[101:30.90]Oops.
[101:33.64]Can't do that.
[101:43.36]I don't get that.
[101:44.00]I don't get it.
[101:45.94]I won't lie.
[101:46.94]I don't.
[101:47.50]I don't.
[101:48.08]I don't get it.
[101:48.86]I don't get that one.
[101:49.68]Declan!
[101:50.06]Okay.
[101:50.48]Now.
[102:10.31]I need to... Don't get that!
[102:13.35]Does that despawn?
[102:16.23]Alright, so we've got a scenario where I've got to press the button up there, go get this Pope back.
[102:25.44]No.
[102:26.80]No!
[102:28.12]No!
[102:28.78]No!
[102:30.16]Oh my god!
[102:41.77]I still got it.
[102:42.69]No more screaming, I promise.
[102:43.83]Okay.
[103:09.07]No, I have to go all the way up to get the helmet.
[103:10.61]Okay, hold on.
[103:21.62]I'm freaking out.
[103:22.72]I don't get it.
[103:23.24]I'm fucked up.
[103:24.20]I don't understand.
[103:24.80]I'm fucking freaking out.
[103:27.54]Well, I don't know.
[103:28.06]I... Just get up here?
[103:35.37]Do I not even need the helmet?
[103:47.35]Um, I... I don't think I even need to use the P-switch for here.
[103:52.91]I think I just have to follow it up.
[104:00.50]Okay.
[104:01.52]So, just take it, and then, like, can I just get up there?
[104:05.00]Okay.
[104:12.03]Okay, see, this is why I was freaking out, because I don't... I guess... I never even needed it in the first place.
[104:16.88]Okay.
[104:19.24]Let's go.
[104:28.05]I need to bring it all the way over there.
[104:29.59]No, just don't pick... Oh my god, I'm gonna freak the fuck out.
[104:32.53]I need to bring it up all the way.
[104:39.96]I had to bring it up the whole way, not just right there.
[104:42.04]I gotta bring up the entire way.
[104:44.44]How am I gonna do that now?
[104:47.72]How did you get down here?
[105:01.13]I thought that when it came over here, I could press it.
[105:03.76]I didn't have to go all the way up.
[105:15.36]Okay, so now... Wait, what the fuck has happened?
[105:19.94]What does this matter?
[105:20.60]Do I just do it now?
[105:26.54]I think do it now, right?
[105:32.35]Go all the way up?
[105:36.59]Isn't that gonna fuck this up?
[105:56.52]Huh?
[106:09.35]What the fuck?
[106:12.18]I didn't know something came out of there.
[106:13.60]I didn't know something came out of that fucking thing.
[106:17.18]How was I supposed to know that?
[106:19.47]I didn't know that a thing came out!
[106:22.18]That's why I spent this much time trying to figure out what the hell to do!
[106:25.46]I didn't know that someone was going to jump out of there!
[106:30.59]You can't dock points on my intelligence because I didn't know!
[106:33.45]Pepe face!
[107:00.95]I didn't know like a bomb walked out of that.
[107:03.43]That was fun though.
[107:04.13]Alright slime where's yours?
[107:06.17]Alright, we're gonna do it's time for slimes level
[107:23.62]Let's go.
[107:39.49]This is called marioantivirus.exe.
[107:42.87]This one's gonna be great.
[107:44.77]Hackers have broken through Mario's firewall and infected his PC with bugs.
[107:53.46]Is that supposed to... Is that the Windows logo?
[107:55.10]That's awesome.
[107:57.96]I have to defeat all 20... Oh, okay.
[108:07.74]First door?
[108:09.12]We'll do door one.
[108:11.30]Oh.
[108:15.88]Okay.
[108:16.72]It's just there.
[108:17.28]Is this supposed to be the computer?
[108:19.25]Oh, no.
[108:21.63]A P-switch.
[108:24.69]My worst enemy anything on let me take this in for a second though anything else over here to look at No, I just want to see Oh god, oh no, uh Do I have to fill this in
[108:55.56]Any more blocks hidden?
[108:57.00]What on Earth?
[108:57.74]Ooh, I got four 1-ups.
[109:00.14]Alright, where do I go from here?
[109:23.56]Do I have to go up and around?
[109:33.20]Oh, shit.
[109:33.70]Okay.
[109:34.76]I have to hit that, I think.
[109:38.30]So let's hit this.
[109:38.98]Mushroom.
[109:39.78]Can't hit that.
[109:49.29]Oh, this is like the microchip.
[109:51.33]Okay, I see.
[109:52.89]So I gotta get all 21?
[110:02.79]Can I not kill these?
[110:03.71]I don't think I can, right?
[110:07.40]I have to hit the POW, don't I?
[110:08.26]Alright, there's two.
[110:12.48]I gotta kill these ones.
[110:17.36]Let's see.
[110:20.70]There it is.
[110:21.16]Alright, three, five.
[110:22.42]How do I get out of here?
[110:25.48]Oh.
[110:29.12]Let's go all the way to the right.
[110:31.29]This is big.
[110:32.63]Holy shit, this is huge.
[110:34.77]Is that the firewall?
[110:43.01]Just leave?
[110:44.52]I can't just leave.
[110:45.24]Ah, shit, that's gonna be horrible.
[110:54.96]Can I?
[110:57.18]I don't think I can.
[110:59.74]Should I try it?
[111:00.22]I don't think I'm ready for that.
[111:02.72]Alright, where are you going?
[111:08.01]Watch out for the icicles.
[111:12.17]Ooh.
[111:14.05]Oh shit, they respawned.
[111:15.87]Okay, it's seven.
[111:23.96]I need...
[111:28.02]I know I was supposed to call it health, but it is technically health.
[111:39.11]Oh, the timer.
[111:40.13]You're right.
[111:41.49]Okay, hold on.
[111:45.65]I'm not going to do this in time.
[111:59.91]There's so much more!
[112:05.91]Get up there!
[112:11.29]Is there any more down here?
[112:14.25]To the left?
[112:17.83]Did I miss any over here?
[112:18.86]I'm gonna have to do this again.
[112:22.58]Did I miss any?
[112:23.28]9 out of 21 over here.
[112:28.16]I don't think I... I think I missed one of the top left.
[112:33.65]Wasting time?
[112:34.25]Well, I'm not gonna beat it, so I might as well just see, like, if there's anything else.
[112:42.48]Holy shit.
[112:43.46]Okay.
[112:48.04]Oh my god.
[112:51.98]This is so big!
[112:54.91]How do I get up here?
[112:57.15]Off of your head?
[112:57.87]Give me the key.
[112:58.53]I got a key now.
[113:04.97]Can you?
[113:06.29]I think he has to kill them, doesn't he?
[113:09.87]No, what?
[113:10.33]How am I killing them?
[113:12.57]What was it?
[113:19.74]On his head?
[113:20.98]Alright, let me try this again.
[113:27.93]This time, I'm not going to take in the scenes.
[113:30.11]It's a very, very pretty level.
[113:36.80]Alright, on to the first batch.
[113:47.04]I still don't understand what the point of that one is.
[113:50.12]Is that a dev kit?
[113:51.78]Probably a dev kit.
[113:52.44]Something like that.
[113:56.76]Oh my god.
[113:57.42]It's okay.
[113:58.94]Okay, I'm like panicking for no reason.
[114:00.36]I have like 12 minutes.
[114:03.12]Oh, it's slippery.
[114:08.14]Shit!
[114:09.71]Okay, there's those two.
[114:11.65]Okay, there's that.
[114:14.53]Okay.
[114:23.23]that anymore.
[114:26.59]Shouldn't have done that.
[114:27.25]That was a dumb idea, but I did it anyways.
[114:31.21]Ooh, there was, look, there was a secret one over here.
[114:33.03]See?
[114:35.49]Shit, I didn't think that was gonna happen.
[114:36.75]Alright, that's ten.
[114:44.34]I feel like you just spawned that in for me.
[114:47.36]Alright, I gotta go through the firewall now.
[114:52.71]How do I get through this without getting hit?
[114:55.13]Uh, through the... I gotta just go.
[114:57.78]I gotta go for it.
[114:58.84]Go for it.
[115:05.28]Okay, I'm fine.
[115:08.22]Don't go through this door.
[115:09.94]Mushroom in here.
[115:10.40]Alright, now this... This, uh... Alright, hold on.
[115:16.65]What does this do?
[115:21.85]I should have known that was gonna fucking happen.
[115:26.25]Why did I just not understand that?
[115:28.33]That's in case you miss one.
[115:29.41]I get it.
[115:31.33]I'm gonna go all the way to the right.
[115:35.62]Oh my god.
[115:36.24]Okay, there's all this.
[115:37.58]Um... Did I just get spawned on?
[115:46.85]What the hell?
[115:54.42]Telefract.
[115:56.02]Alright, now I know what the door does.
[115:57.18]I don't even need to grab these.
[115:59.12]I don't know what I'm doing.
[116:07.53]Just do the skip.
[116:11.89]Wait till it goes over that way.
[116:14.31]Got it?
[116:16.17]There we go.
[116:18.45]There it is.
[116:26.20]There it is.
[116:27.62]Don't get that.
[116:28.46]No reason to.
[116:30.79]Same thing I did this way.
[116:32.21]All the way around.
[116:33.95]Boink.
[116:38.45]There it is.
[116:39.99]Okay, there it is.
[116:42.63]Ten.
[116:43.67]No.
[116:44.15]Yes.
[116:46.59]You hope I'm having a good day?
[116:47.49]I'm having a good day.
[116:48.09]Hope you're having a good day, too.
[116:49.85]How is your day?
[116:51.31]Hope it's good.
[116:57.70]Alright, here we go.
[117:03.80]Oh man, my brain is too small for that.
[117:05.60]Alright, let's just do this.
[117:11.24]Oh my god.
[117:12.30]No!
[117:13.60]No!
[117:14.24]Why?
[117:14.62]I just wanted to... Alright, I have to get rid of this stupid magician.
[117:19.04]This magician's pissing me off.
[117:21.32]That's the hacker.
[117:24.18]Alright, I got a key?
[117:31.50]I got another key!
[117:33.12]I can do it again?
[117:35.54]Two keys!
[117:41.26]How many?
[117:41.90]20?
[117:42.02]I got 21!
[117:42.42]I got them all!
[117:43.04]How do I get out of here?
[117:50.98]What do I have to do?
[117:51.56]Is there like an exit door?
[118:08.74]Pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe.
[118:12.72]Like, what do you mean pipe?
[118:14.76]Pipe?
[118:15.80]Pipe.
[118:18.26]Pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe.
[118:20.02]I don't know what you mean by pipe.
[118:21.57]Okay, I'm fucking losing my mind.
[118:22.67]I'm freaking out.
[118:23.47]The hacker's gonna kill me.
[118:24.69]Pipe!
[118:29.13]I got it.
[118:33.27]That was cool.
[118:38.90]That was actually really fun.
[118:39.90]Really well thought out level.
[118:48.41]That was its time for slime.
[118:51.05]Good shit.
[118:58.09]You look lovely today.
[119:00.07]Oh, okay.
[119:01.21]Oh, no, wait.
[119:01.81]Somebody has a fish.
[119:02.71]No, I'm not going to do that.
[119:04.93]You look lovely today.
[119:08.49]Usually the fish gets me.
[119:13.61]But today, it's all about the compliments that get me today.
[119:23.42]You have RNG in your name here.
[119:26.92]I wonder if that means anything.
[119:28.96]Jerma's Family Dinner.
[119:33.84]You can beat this in seven seconds.
[119:59.00]Like get of coins
[120:20.61]This is supposed to be the clown car?
[120:22.85]Alright, um... It was an easy one.
[120:35.90]I'm gonna get the world record on this.
[120:48.83]7 seconds?
[120:49.41]7.3?
[120:49.57]Here we go.
[121:09.08]Is that longer than 7 seconds?
[121:18.94]BELL RINGS
[121:59.95]That has to be pretty close.
[122:07.03]What?
[122:08.76]I just had it.
[122:09.68]Somebody just got a better one than I did.
[122:11.60]What?
[122:11.70]It was 7-3.
[122:12.80]Now it's 7-0?
[122:13.24]One more.
[122:32.50]I don't care.
[122:33.04]This is it.
[122:35.68]Even if it's... I don't think that was the one.
[122:42.41]Six... No.
[122:44.31]That was... Mine was cleaner.
[122:45.85]But again, seven... No, you guys can fucking fight each other over it.
[122:58.52]Hey, that was a short and sweet one.
[122:59.62]Thank you.
[123:05.70]You're beautiful also.
[123:07.38]Fuck you.
[123:10.17]Alright, yeah.
[123:12.21]Let's do that one.
[123:19.82]N. M. After this I'm going to go P. Come back and do some more.
[123:31.58]Mid-airs made easy.
[123:33.30]These mid-airs require no kaizo skill.
[123:36.94]Red pipes provide hints if needed.
[123:42.44]This is apparently impossible.
[123:46.96]1% completion rate.
[123:47.71]This is going to be tough.
[123:52.81]These mid-airs require no kaizo skill.
[123:55.17]I don't even know what that means.
[123:57.99]This is way over my head.
[124:08.27]Up here?
[124:14.76]I need another... Is this low gravity?
[124:22.84]What?
[124:24.42]Okay, well that changes everything.
[124:25.66]So I have to go up, jump, and grab it, and jump?
[124:38.25]Throw it over?
[124:41.05]I don't know.
[124:42.19]Wait, no no.
[124:44.84]Oh no, give me that back!
[124:47.28]Ow.
[125:11.35]The low gravity just fucked with me.
[125:12.72]Hold on.
[125:13.08]Alright, so you just... Throw it up.
[125:16.32]Jump up there.
[125:19.30]No.
[125:19.59]Why?
[125:19.91]I don't want to grab the fucking thing.
[125:21.59]Oh my god.
[125:22.67]I don't want to grab it.
[125:24.17]I want to just... Okay, we'll have to start over again.
[125:26.09]Oh.
[125:43.48]Oh.
[125:45.59]I didn't have to even go up there.
[125:48.93]Okay.
[125:53.31]Use red pipes for a hint.
[125:55.77]Well, we don't need one yet.
[125:56.77]What are these for?
[126:04.63]Nothing, I guess?
[126:05.45]I don't know.
[126:09.09]Now I have to definitely jump up on this.
[126:19.78]It resets the level.
[126:20.64]Oh, okay.
[126:23.08]Is this auto-scrolling?
[126:25.40]Wait, hold on.
[126:31.89]Get up there.
[126:34.63]Okay.
[126:36.17]And then... Okay.
[126:41.64]Now fall through this.
[126:47.05]Something tell me I wasn't supposed to do that.
[127:07.64]Red pipe, red pipe.
[127:09.04]Well, not yet.
[127:11.28]Oops.
[127:12.16]Well, yes, fine.
[127:13.06]What is it showing me?
[127:18.05]Well, it actually is a full-on, this is how you beat it.
[127:23.86]That's really cool, actually.
[127:25.00]That's a nice touch.
[127:33.58]Come on.
[127:43.72]Come on!
[127:44.93]I'm gonna go do it like the video.
[127:46.97]Ugh!
[128:01.01]I have this problem in Mario where I have to hold down the face button.
[128:05.13]Why?
[128:06.29]For everything.
[128:07.99]No matter what.
[128:08.83]I have to.
[128:10.23]Even if I'm not trying to run. ...
[128:19.68]Okay, so... What does this want me to do here?
[128:23.04]Do I need to bring that up with me?
[128:27.29]Or damage boost and then... I just needed to wait like an extra five seconds.
[128:36.89]Is what I had to do.
[128:38.79]Okay.
[128:38.99]Let's see.
[128:44.88]Okay.
[128:51.25]That's gonna be something, isn't it?
[128:55.23]Oh, uh... What?
[129:02.63]Alright.
[129:11.42]Ah!
[129:11.80]Okay, we're fine.
[129:13.68]No.
[129:14.78]There's no red pipe here, guys.
[129:15.88]I don't see a red pipe.
[129:20.30]No red pipe.
[129:21.46]Uh...
[129:48.81]Oh, damn it.
[129:49.47]Okay.
[129:49.77]How far does that go?
[129:53.41]Shit.
[129:56.11]Got it.
[129:57.63]Okay.
[129:58.49]No.
[130:00.11]Then go to the checkpoint.
[130:04.00]What do I do with this thing?
[130:06.32]No red pipe either.
[130:07.98]Do I have to fall down with it?
[130:09.46]Or throw it over there?
[130:10.32]I didn't see what was on the other side of this.
[130:14.76]Throw it over there?
[130:18.29]And then... I thought that was a ground.
[130:39.96]I don't have to go fast.
[130:42.21]For some reason, I think I have to fall down and then like jump on it later.
[130:48.62]Who am I kidding?
[130:49.08]I'm going fast.
[130:56.82]Okay.
[130:57.96]Now... No, no, no, no, no!
[131:00.36]Oh, just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[131:02.99]Alright, and now, um... Uh... Hmm.
[131:15.08]Jump?
[131:15.54]I have to... I think I have to throw this...
[131:18.99]Jump on top of it with the spring.
[131:20.57]Throw the spring.
[131:21.37]Jump on the spring.
[131:25.10]I think.
[131:29.38]I can't reset the level ever again.
[131:30.68]No!
[131:33.32]Oh, come on.
[131:34.56]Really?
[131:34.88]Did I seriously just do that to myself?
[131:41.11]I'm trying...
[131:49.30]I'm stuck.
[132:05.62]The doors... I don't... Do you understand I'm trying to get to the doors on the left?
[132:11.30]And I have ruined it for myself?
[132:22.37]God damn it.
[132:26.11]I feel like if I fall at the right angle, I might be able to... There it is.
[132:34.13]Alright.
[132:34.47]I just... Don't worry.
[132:38.25]But I'm probably gonna die because that's... I have to grab this, throw this, stand on that.
[132:44.18]Let me just see how fast it goes.
[132:45.52]Okay, grab that.
[132:46.52]That goes pretty damn fast.
[132:57.40]It's the other way around.
[133:06.95]Oh, give me that.
[133:07.77]Give me this.
[133:08.69]Give that to me.
[133:09.79]Give me this.
[133:10.23]I need that.
[133:13.93]Am I overthinking it?
[133:14.75]I have to jump, throw, and then... I think I am overthinking it.
[133:33.07]What?
[133:33.33]I... Holding?
[133:34.81]Why?
[133:36.13]I wish there was a way I could... Is there a button that you can hold the run without pick up button?
[133:40.86]I wish I could press it.
[133:45.30]Okay.
[133:49.32]Alright.
[133:57.39]Let's try this again.
[133:59.53]So...
[134:01.14]Throw the POW and throw... Okay, throw the POW, throw the... Blow up!
[134:06.14]I did it.
[134:08.22]I'm gonna say I did it.
[134:12.74]Um, I have to do like a little trail.
[134:31.93]How far do I need to go?
[134:39.63]No, no, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[134:48.89]Did I go too high?
[134:55.08]I went too high.
[134:55.90]Shit, I can't get that back.
[134:57.24]Where's my reset button?
[135:05.12]There's no reset door here?
[135:06.11]God damn it.
[135:16.93]No.
[135:18.31]Shit.
[135:20.57]I gotta get it up here.
[135:21.43]No!
[135:24.11]I don't... Where's my reset door?
[135:44.89]Usually I can get that pretty well.
[135:47.75]Although I screwed this one up last time.
[135:55.36]Oops.
[136:03.56]Fuck.
[136:10.57]No, I usually can get this.
[136:12.93]Damn it.
[136:20.10]Holding Y in a Mario game!
[136:21.62]Don't ever do it!
[136:43.66]Still don't get this part, though.
[136:47.76]Don't throw the power, just use it.
[136:51.75]I don't think that killed anything.
[136:52.89]Did that kill anything down here?
[136:53.99]No, it didn't.
[136:57.61]I needed to see.
[136:58.47]No, it doesn't kill anything over there.
[137:11.08]No!
[137:12.70]Just throw it!
[137:15.68]I got it over there.
[137:16.64]I don't give a fuck.
[137:17.50]It's over there now, isn't it?
[137:23.22]I'm vetoing this one.
[137:27.62]Only a few more tries and then I'm vetoing this one.
[137:41.46]No, I didn't want to even do that.
[137:42.58]I grabbed it again by holding Y. Oh my god.
[137:50.11]Why would they make the run button the same as the grab button?
[137:52.81]Everybody runs in Mario.
[137:54.21]Everybody holds that button down.
[137:57.37]Make it like L fucking 2 or something.
[137:59.63]Why does it have to be Y?
[138:14.81]NO!
[138:17.38]That fucking Y!
[138:23.93]Nothing's gonna bring me down today.
[138:47.24]Hold X. You can't hold X and Y at the same time.
[138:51.10]You have to, like, turn your hand inside out.
[138:56.96]I'm getting, like, tilted down.
[139:12.25]Alright, Jesus.
[139:13.13]Get me over here.
[139:13.97]Throw the... Ugh.
[139:16.12]Throw the spring first and then grab the POW.
[139:18.55]I'm gonna just go.
[139:21.82]Oh my god, I hate it.
[139:46.39]Alright, three more attempts and I'm stamping a veto on this one.
[139:55.06]I didn't grab fast enough.
[140:00.56]No. No. No. No. No. No.
[140:11.96]No.
[140:14.58]No.
[140:15.24]I don't think so.
[140:37.50]I'm just gonna take the... I'm just gonna damage boost over it.
[140:40.10]I'm not gonna do that.
[140:40.82]I'm not gonna be able to do that shit.
[140:41.98]No, no, no.
[140:42.74]God damn it.
[141:05.74]This shit is fucking so difficult.
[141:09.16]He's like throw, jump, grab.
[141:11.96]This wasn't in Mario 2.
[141:19.42]Alright.
[141:27.84]I don't have the momentum to go all the way- I'm just gonna damage boost it, I think.
[141:32.34]Cause I don't have- I don't- I'm not getting the momentum to go forward.
[141:36.40]To jump on the spring.
[141:37.30]So that just flies forward.
[141:41.64]And then jump across.
[141:44.88]How far does this go?
[141:46.03]Alright, hold on.
[141:48.59]Let me look at that.
[142:04.77]If I run, grab jump.
[142:10.93]Get on the roof.
[142:11.89]I don't think I need to... If I get on the roof, I lose the spring.
[142:17.22]Ah, that was weird.
[142:18.46]Try it again.
[142:22.76]Don't jump throw... I'm not jump throwing, I'm just walking.
[142:28.05]I don't care.
[142:33.62]Alright, now this is important.
[142:35.54]I need to get this spring on that spike.
[142:39.60]How do I do that without screwing this up?
[142:44.42]This is gonna be so bad.
[142:45.50]I got it.
[142:49.32]I got it.
[142:49.54]Okay, I did it.
[142:50.02]I did it.
[142:50.42]I did it.
[142:50.86]Just don't touch the spikes.
[142:55.04]And then I jump off this one.
[142:56.30]I can do this.
[142:57.07]I can do it.
[142:57.55]I'm gonna do it.
[143:04.15]Oh man, that's fucking scary.
[143:15.68]Oh, yes!
[143:16.72]Yes!
[143:17.86]Yes, there's a checkpoint.
[143:18.84]Thank God.
[143:19.68]Yes, excellent.
[143:24.79]I'm so happy that there's a checkpoint here.
[143:29.27]What a gracious dev.
[143:30.85]I know, thank you, gracious dev.
[143:34.06]So you gotta go... It took me a long time to die.
[143:42.25]Damn.
[143:45.33]Alright, I gotta hit that and fall and go back and hit again?
[143:48.31]Hmm.
[144:07.76]Alright.
[144:08.78]Now what?
[144:09.34]Springs?
[144:09.76]He's throwing a spring.
[144:11.04]Easy.
[144:13.72]I can't pick this up.
[144:15.81]So wait.
[144:18.79]Do I just bounce off this to get faster momentum and then jump over?
[144:23.91]Hold on.
[144:25.19]How far does it go?
[144:41.40]Did I screw it up?
[144:53.59]I think I screwed it up.
[144:56.93]I'm trying to time it so I can... I think it's over.
[145:01.63]So you gotta go right away.
[145:08.88]Oh, boy.
[145:09.56]And you gotta hit the ones up here.
[145:12.08]The two.
[145:13.04]Oh, dear.
[145:13.64]Alright, you gotta do it all in one go.
[145:14.82]Whoa.
[145:20.67]Did I have to keep going?
[145:27.39]I don't think I had to keep going.
[145:30.91]Uh... One.
[145:33.60]And then up.
[145:34.66]Uh...
[145:36.60]I don't know.
[145:37.54]I don't know.
[145:38.41]I think I have to just run really fast and jump and throw this and hit this.
[145:43.19]I think.
[145:47.97]Oops-a-daisy.
[145:48.73]Yeah, that's what I have to do.
[146:05.39]I probably could have jumped on top of that, but I don't understand.
[146:12.21]Oh, guess what I did.
[146:14.56]I pressed Y. Right trigger should be grep.
[146:31.60]Can I remap that?
[146:34.47]You know, you're starting to get annoyed in Mario when you want to remap the controls in Mario.
[146:39.89]Like, that's when you know that you're, like, actually getting angry.
[146:42.43]How do I remap the fucking controls in Mario 2?
[146:45.36]Really?
[146:45.66]Shit!
[147:13.47]Maybe let's just try to keep going left But that would just make me jump up this way.
[147:25.64]It wouldn't do much for me.
[147:26.96]Would it?
[147:29.40]I'm kind of confused.
[147:31.78]But wouldn't I just jump up?
[147:32.92]Would that... I have to actually start to hold X and Y at the same time, but then you have to let go of Y!
[147:44.86]That's so awkward.
[148:01.57]No, I'm not gonna... Just throw the spring.
[148:09.55]Holy shit.
[148:10.31]Okay, well I have... One.
[148:11.87]Was that what I was supposed to do?
[148:18.83]Why did it not do that?
[148:20.15]What happened?
[148:20.49]I get the secret level.
[148:21.62]I win.
[148:40.58]17 minutes.
[148:41.68]Who can beat that in a minute?
[148:45.32]He missed the true ending?
[148:46.14]I don't get true endings, don't you know that?
[148:50.47]1.5% completion.
[148:50.91]I'm good.
[148:51.63]Get the true ending.
[148:52.27]I don't get true endings.
[148:55.39]That was fucking hard.
[148:58.77]That was challenging.
[149:01.19]Very cool, though.
[149:10.80]Uh, yeah, it's time for a pee break.
[149:13.10]I'll be right back.
[149:13.62]Go, uh, do what you need to do.
[149:16.94]See you guys in, like, two minutes.
[149:18.68]Be right back.

[151:19.64]Okay.
[151:20.08]So where are we going now?
[151:56.96]You will consider mine.
[151:58.22]It even has a fish.
[152:02.64]Uh... I absolutely will consider that.
[152:09.14]FailFish.
[152:10.02]Oh, okay, I get it.
[152:10.75]Now I see what you mean.
[152:18.19]Um...
[152:20.47]I think... Did you type it in wrong?
[152:25.19]I think... Did you mean that?
[152:26.85]Why can I not... Let's see.
[152:35.42]What?
[152:37.92]This is... This is wrong.
[152:44.92]Why can I not type... I think the code is wrong.
[152:48.52]Why is he... What's going on?
[152:56.52]Why is Z, I, and O not available?
[152:58.84]Because they look like 2s, 1s, and 0s?
[153:00.60]Alright.
[153:09.87]Oh, so that person just was a made-up level.
[153:11.93]Alright.
[153:13.09]I see fun, cool level, please.
[153:14.97]I'll do this one.
[153:35.72]Not too hard for you.
[153:37.26]What do you mean, for me?
[153:39.94]It's called Thmop.
[153:42.14]Thank you for the level.
[153:49.68]Standard puzzle solving.
[153:53.84]For me?
[153:54.24]Or for you?
[154:00.18]I thought I had to hit that.
[154:03.28]With my head, but nope.
[154:06.02]Let's go.
[154:11.92]Oops.
[154:18.31]Oh, it's in 3D World.
[154:19.49]It sucks automatically.
[154:21.63]That's not true.
[154:24.07]Um, I can jump up, dodge that, jump around, get the P, and then get the...
[154:47.45]What's going on?
[154:47.77]Oh.
[154:47.97]Can I get it back?
[154:51.29]Secret, secret way.
[154:57.72]I always beat it secret way.
[154:59.84]I actually kind of want to go that way.
[155:25.35]Alright, let's go!
[155:43.12]I just made myself fucking like two times bigger.
[155:45.52]When you play Super Mario dog shit 3D, get stuck to the wall.
[155:50.45]You just become like flypaper when you play Super Mario 3D World.
[156:00.95]What- what happened to my- did you see the bottom of the screen?
[156:13.81]Alright, let's just do it.
[156:14.69]Can I... I don't think... I... Super fucking 3D flypaper.
[156:17.84]That's what this should be called.
[156:19.94]Alright.
[156:55.40]3D World, man.
[156:59.82]Oh, and they make it so you can't get up here!
[157:01.66]Alright.
[157:02.40]Alright, I'm gonna be alright.
[157:06.35]I'm gonna be alright.
[157:06.95]I thought you said you liked 3D World.
[157:18.32]Where do I go from here?
[157:24.42]Up?
[157:25.18]I don't know, up?
[157:28.28]I don't know
[157:46.04]What are these- I get it.
[157:46.81]Don't really last for a certain amount of time.
[158:22.72]I feel like I have a backpack full of cement on when I play Mario 3D World.
[158:27.23]Oh, I...
[158:51.36]I don't like 3D World.
[158:55.93]I remember when I- oh, the Wii.
[158:57.45]Whatever it was.
[158:58.21]I got it- I played Mario 3D World for like 30 minutes and I was like, I don't like this game.
[159:24.54]You understand?
[159:25.24]You understand what happened?
[159:26.22]You understand?
[159:27.96]What the fuck is going on?
[159:30.07]New Super Mario Brothers 3D... whatever.
[159:39.88]It's equal parts like floaty and heavy at the same time.
[159:54.08]So, I'm not gonna be able to do this shit now.
[160:29.11]Okay, you know when you eat a huge fucking meal and right at the last bite you feel like shit and you're wicked way down and you're like, I shouldn't have eaten that last bite.
[160:39.34]I feel like I have like a stomach full of fucking a bunch of like meat and cheese and shit.
[160:51.88]I don't understand what's happening now.
[161:07.50]Yeah, Super Mario New Wii 3D Full Pizza.
[161:25.35]Can you do it again, please can I get this to happen again
[161:57.06]extra large fucking steak and cheese I'm gonna give subs Jerma sucks get five subs
[162:30.19]Now just go down and then... What the fuck do I do here?
[162:32.91]Oh, okay, you two... I don't know.
[162:36.77]Alright, I'm gonna do this a few more times.
[162:44.21]Only a few more times.
[162:47.23]And no more Mario 3 world levels before I fucking puke.
[162:51.61]Alright.
[162:54.39]Just kill me.
[163:00.37]Do you remember the last time we played this?
[163:02.11]What was the game that made me, like, very upset?
[163:05.98]It wasn't Mario World.
[163:07.00]It wasn't Mario 2.
[163:08.28]It wasn't, like, Mario 64.
[163:09.42]It was these ones!
[163:19.29]It was Mario Maker 2.
[163:20.25]That's, you know, you're right.
[163:28.20]Why does it, why?
[163:29.64]I don't even, why even have it if it's that, oh my god, the fucking wall jump is like equal parts impossible to do and equal parts like too easy to get stuck.
[163:44.56]How is it possible?
[164:07.27]What the fuck happened?!
[164:13.17]Alright, this is it.
[164:18.06]Last- No, this is the last try.
[164:19.76]I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.
[164:34.39]I know this game is like a 9.8 on IGN.
[164:37.25]I'm talking about Mario 3D World.
[164:38.81]I know, I know, but every game that's a Mario game has to be a 9 or you go out of business.
[164:43.05]You understand?
[164:54.30]OH MY GOD!
[165:04.97]I'm done.
[165:28.97]This isn't 3D World.
[165:30.40]No, I know, but you know what?
[165:32.12]New Super Mario Wii Brothers.
[165:33.72]Whatever the hell it's called.
[165:34.56]New Luigi Plays Wii.
[165:36.04]Whatever the hell it is.
[165:36.68]Alright, we'll do this one.
[165:47.77]Q... 2, 3.
[166:04.51]can't beat this land well you know it's uh this is Joel's level oh great 0.1 this 58 000 attempts here do you do you think I'm gonna be able to do this I'm not gonna be able to do this
[166:36.04]Oh, God.
[166:36.62]I don't even want to know.
[166:38.00]You have to get all the key things?
[166:41.39]Ugh, I feel so- I feel right at home, though.
[166:44.92]This is Mario 3.
[167:01.55]Oop, okay.
[167:02.51]Watch out for the Goomba.
[167:03.17]Should I go underneath?
[167:05.55]How am I gonna get under this?
[167:06.39]Oh, this just gets worse by the second.
[167:07.91]What do I do?
[167:08.79]Underneath.
[167:20.52]Oh, God.
[167:21.30]Wait.
[167:21.96]Hold on.
[167:22.38]Slow down.
[167:23.56]Slow down.
[167:30.76]Ah!
[167:31.84]No!
[167:32.74]No!
[167:33.02]I needed that!
[167:34.89]What?
[167:35.55]How do I get that and then go- Oh, God!
[167:40.21]You have to go around?
[167:41.35]How do you pick that up?
[167:43.53]Is it- Go up on top and- Okay.
[167:46.41]Oh, this is gonna be hell.
[167:47.71]Okay, I'm going.
[168:03.20]For a second, I thought I could do that.
[168:04.54]I don't know why.
[168:05.12]That might be a little secret, though.
[168:07.61]You might actually feel good today.
[168:08.85]You know what I'm saying?
[168:09.73]Okay.
[168:14.01]It took Joel 20 hours to beat this.
[168:16.91]And he's the one that made it.
[168:27.95]It actually literally took 20.
[168:32.19]I think I can do that.
[168:32.97]I think it's possible to go right when... That's the little skip.
[168:38.07]That's the dev skip.
[168:42.03]Okay, let's try this again.
[168:44.05]Oh, man.
[168:48.33]It was 20 hours across two different streams.
[168:53.35]I'm gonna try this.
[169:08.68]the one that come where's the one that comes out what doesn't one come out why would I go this way if they I thought
[169:38.13]Oh man, I'm not gonna be able to do this.
[169:43.45]I'm not gonna be able to do this.
[169:46.39]See, that's what I mean.
[169:47.18]Then go down with it.
[169:59.50]I can't even get this first jump correct.
[170:04.44]Alright, I need to- is it the top of the coin on the arrow?
[170:18.84]Somebody do it.
[170:19.48]Kill it.
[170:22.64]Kill it!
[170:23.12]Somebody kill it!
[170:27.16]Kill them!
[170:31.11]No, it's not the last coin.
[170:33.21]I have to get this jump down.
[170:34.45]And I don't know what point it is.
[170:36.11]Hold on.
[170:38.35]What if... Let me just...
[170:48.37]Is there anything else I can do?
[170:51.95]Okay.
[170:53.26]I'm just gonna go now.
[170:54.76]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[171:00.46]Alright, then- oh man, that sucks.

[171:19.51]wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait get over here wait what can I can I do that can I do this can I actually do this if I
[171:53.67]It took Joel 19 hours when knowing how to do it.
[171:58.27]Yeah, I mean, I'm willing to just have a little bit of fun with it, but... I'm never gonna beat this.
[172:09.52]I need to at least get this first jump correct.
[172:17.72]What if I just say fuck it?
[172:18.66]No, I'm not gonna say fuck it and go that way.
[172:21.66]Oh man, this is gonna be hell.
[172:27.11]The name of this level is called see I get it Like
[173:04.53]Oh shit!
[173:05.11]What?
[173:05.33]Okay.
[173:05.87]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[173:06.63]Wait, wait, wait.
[173:18.26]Get me out of here!
[173:20.08]Um, what do I do?
[173:21.90]I don't know.
[173:22.54]I don't know.
[173:22.98]I don't know.
[173:23.30]You have to run.
[173:24.24]Just run?
[173:24.70]And jump?
[173:39.60]I at least have to get to the end of this.
[173:45.02]You gotta be kidding me.
[173:51.38]Why?
[173:51.88]I'm dead.
[173:56.66]Alright, just run.
[173:59.43]I'm just gonna run and then jump.
[174:09.53]Do I keep holding this?
[174:13.31]I don't know.
[174:14.37]Oh my...
[174:38.81]Nooo!
[174:40.27]Why?
[174:44.03]That's fuckin' insane.
[174:45.51]You gotta get that little pixel.
[174:53.64]What?! !
[175:09.16]How do you even program that to work?
[175:13.86]Oh my god.
[175:18.39]Oh, fuck.
[175:20.67]How does that work?
[175:22.81]Yeah, how did he do this in like 20 straight hours?
[175:32.40]At hour number four?
[175:35.24]I don't think I would... I think I'd be like, guys, I have to leave.
[175:38.24]I'll see you, like, tomorrow.
[175:39.40]And tomorrow, I'm not doing this.
[175:56.21]What?
[175:58.53]How did I get it the first few times?
[175:59.83]Easily.
[176:07.20]Don't go faster than the shell, that would be a mistake.
[176:10.22]Yeah.
[176:11.30]Yeah, I don't know about this one.
[176:20.57]Yeah, I don't know... I don't know about this one.
[176:38.62]Why does my microphone smell like it's on fire?
[176:42.34]It's clearly not.
[176:58.38]Come on, please!
[177:01.12]I don't go that fast!
[177:07.97]Alright.
[177:09.85]Now, I'm gonna do this.
[177:11.43]I'm gonna get this and then fall here.
[177:18.90]Alright, going.
[177:23.60]That was a laugh.
[177:24.44]Somebody laughed.
[177:24.98]I don't know.
[177:27.70]I don't know why this is supposed to be funny.
[177:29.04]Why is it funny?
[177:32.92]I obviously can't jump over there.
[177:43.23]Do I just lose?
[177:48.45]I think I might just lose.
[177:53.44]Alright, so that door doesn't do anything.
[178:13.04]You know how I get with this kind of shit, though.
[178:14.70]Like, I'm gonna be here... I'm not gonna be here for much longer.
[178:20.34]I can't.
[178:20.84]We got, like, all the viewer levels to do.
[178:22.44]I'm not gonna do this the whole time.
[178:25.53]I'll be here for a year.
[178:35.27]Alright, now... So how... I shouldn't... Should I not get this?
[178:40.60]If I get the...
[178:42.97]Okay, so I have the damage boost.
[178:47.19]Uh-oh.
[178:47.83]What?
[178:48.23]No.
[178:48.69]What?
[178:48.89]Come on.
[179:19.07]So I have to wait till the mushroom gets down and then get hurt and then run?
[179:28.21]This?
[179:28.55]Shit over there.
[179:44.79]Do I have to jump over that or something?
[180:12.48]Oh my god, I have to go!
[180:13.38]I just panicked.
[180:15.72]I didn't want to hit the thing, I was going to hit it.
[180:18.64]Alright, so, let me... hold on a minute.
[180:27.39]If I hit the mushroom, and then the mushroom touches me while I'm small, like, walk up, get hurt, run, damage, boost...
[180:50.73]You can't make that jump.
[181:10.20]You can't make those jumps.
[181:19.02]But where do I stop?
[181:27.45]It didn't even... That was... It didn't kill the thing up there.
[181:32.55]I was gonna die.
[181:48.53]Let me look at this again.
[181:54.86]The shell comes down.
[181:56.12]Does it come all the way over here?
[181:59.26]Does another one come out?
[181:59.90]Where does that one go?
[182:03.44]It bounces over here.
[182:10.05]And then where does it go from here?
[182:12.69]No way.
[182:16.84]It hits the switch?
[182:19.32]Okay, what- what- is it hitting the- the- I- I gotta just kinda run.
[182:32.41]Oh.
[182:33.77]OH!
[182:34.27]Oh, okay, hold on.
[182:36.07]I can... go in there?
[182:38.26]When it's red?
[182:39.94]I have no idea.
[182:59.25]And then... Let me just try to stop.
[183:08.89]Fuck!
[183:11.65]Is there a safe zone?
[183:13.57]I don't know.
[183:16.65]I don't know where the safe part is.
[183:21.69]But thankfully I can do this pretty easily now.
[183:32.85]I brought the shell with me the first time and... Dude, I don't have to get on top of the shell.
[183:38.95]How would I do that?
[183:51.12]This level is named after... Central British time.
[183:54.30]Yeah, I know.
[183:55.42]But... There's gotta be like a solution.
[184:00.11]Alright, I'm gonna- a few more tries.
[184:10.11]Do I actually need the shell?
[184:18.69]Alright, I'm skipping it.
[184:20.65]I'm gonna skip it after one- like two more.
[184:22.77]If I can't get- if I can't figure this out... There's probably like another 75 hours to this.
[184:34.03]Oh, God.
[184:35.03]Do I have to get all those too?
[184:42.96]Shit.
[184:46.29]The solution is to punch yourself in the groin for a couple dozen hours.
[184:51.09]It's true.
[184:53.25]No, that's not the solution.
[184:54.25]That's...
[185:02.73]I at least want to get through here one more time really Shit, okay.
[185:05.74]Um
[185:31.44]I can't make that jump.
[185:35.42]Hold on, let me test something.
[185:37.95]No, there's no way.
[185:48.51]That's gonna kill me.
[185:49.25]No, fuck.
[185:51.47]No, come on.
[185:58.86]No, no!
[186:00.56]How did I make it worse?
[186:07.59]What is that?
[186:08.03]How do I get over there?
[186:33.33]Alright, this is it.
[186:34.97]I can't, I can't, I... It's crazy level and it's fun and it's fucking crazy.
[186:39.83]But I gotta, I gotta move on.
[186:44.68]You're telling me that I need to jump over these.
[186:47.78]And that's the way to do it.
[186:51.28]That's what you're trying to tell me?
[186:55.10]You're telling me, you're telling me that I have to jump over each one of these.
[186:59.75]Every single one.
[187:10.17]Oh my god.
[187:14.25]You have to keep the momentum going too.
[187:18.10]You have to just keep going.
[187:20.72]You can't stop.
[187:21.42]If you stop, you're dead.
[187:48.59]No!
[187:49.45]No way!
[187:50.25]No way!
[187:51.21]I'm not doing it.
[187:52.07]I'm done.
[187:52.61]No fucking way.
[187:53.96]We're out.
[187:54.68]That's it.
[187:55.26]That's it for this one.
[187:56.00]No more of this one.
[187:57.80]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[187:59.02]No, no, no.
[187:59.52]You're gonna do the whole thing all the way down?
[188:01.10]There's no way.
[188:02.04]It's not fucking happening.
[188:04.76]You gotta be kidding me.
[188:12.23]Because then you're going to turn and do it down the bottom.
[188:14.49]Holy shit, how did you ever beat this?
[188:22.75]Even if you memorize this, there's a tiny bit of human error.
[188:29.09]I want to just... CB failure.
[188:50.46]Are you serious?
[188:54.36]How would you even do this?
[188:57.16]There's no way!
[189:00.01]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[189:01.63]You have to follow the mushroom all the way.
[189:06.67]The whole way.
[189:16.14]Look at this shit.
[189:17.32]Are you ready for this?
[189:23.17]Look at what you have to fucking do.
[189:30.75]Check this out.
[190:18.73]I can't even get past the first three blocks.
[190:21.53]It looks like he's walking it, too.
[190:23.66]Is he walking it?
[190:25.62]He wasn't running.
[190:29.56]He's walking.
[190:30.60]Come on, get...
[190:48.04]So he's walking.
[190:51.38]Alright, I can do this.
[190:52.44]Here we go.
[190:54.04]Wait, why is it in front of me?
[191:02.11]You gotta hit and jump around it.
[191:03.13]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[191:04.55]No.
[191:06.63]No, I'm not doing it.
[191:09.03]It's too hard.
[191:11.51]And that's not even, like... I'm not gonna do this.

[195:51.43]My soul is leaving my body.
[195:53.23]I'm alright.
[195:54.41]I'm not mad.
[195:56.33]I'm not mad.
[195:59.44]I'm not mad.

[196:17.15]You got a plan on September 21st?
[196:19.69]Cancel it.
[196:26.82]Wait, do I... I'm gonna leave that on.
[196:44.64]No, I want to jump on his head
[197:13.04]Now what?
[197:14.14]How fast is he?
[197:15.10]What?
[197:15.54]What?
[197:42.88]I'm just gonna hold right.
[197:45.76]There's nothing else I can do there.
[197:47.34]Do I have to actually kill that thing?
[198:09.89]No!
[198:10.33]No, he's too close!
[198:12.59]Oh, fuck.
[198:13.51]This is crazy.
[198:18.43]I like this one, it's fun.
[198:42.36]I wonder if there's more.
[198:48.50]Oh!
[199:00.28]This is the one.
[199:00.83]He ain't even close.
[199:05.95]They're all cheering him on.
[199:06.87]Alright, from here I gotta jump to...
[199:12.93]Anything else?
[199:13.49]I'm scared.
[199:14.46]Can I make this jump?
[199:16.80]What?
[199:17.18]No!
[199:21.87]The slide, I thought the slide was gonna be... It slides.
[199:26.61]Oh.
[199:26.75]Um.
[199:27.25]You know.
[199:31.89]The slide.
[199:33.77]I don't know why.
[199:34.43]I don't understand.
[199:36.58]You can slide up.
[199:37.44]Can you?
[199:38.22]I don't know.
[199:38.68]I don't remember that.
[199:40.58]Can you?
[199:41.06]I don't know.
[199:55.12]Oh my god, why did you do that?
[200:22.58]Is he gonna go the other way?
[200:28.59]Alright, I'm gonna kill him, and then we don't have to worry about it.
[200:58.59]I swear to God, I'm just trying.
[201:00.35]I'm trying.
[201:00.99]I'm really trying.
[201:02.34]God damn it.
[201:05.32]This game, man.
[201:07.56]This game.
[201:08.72]It's just, it's too much sometimes.
[201:11.34]I'm trying.
[201:12.03]And then I'm just stingily jumping.
[201:23.72]Not even twist jumping, I'm just normal jumping.
[201:25.95]Okay.
[201:27.27]I think he's gonna catch me, I don't think I did it fast enough.
[201:53.71]Alright, that was really close.
[202:04.17]And then... Is that it?
[202:05.71]There's a troll coming up, I know it.
[202:08.89]There's gonna be some... A block or a brick or a hammer or a... A block or a... Something that's gonna stop me.
[202:15.05]I don't know what it is, but it's gonna happen.
[202:16.60]I don't know what it is.
[202:19.02]Something bad's gonna happen right here.
[202:20.02]I don't know what it is.
[202:20.74]Uh...
[202:29.83]How do I... I need to have the shell hit that, but I can't get it.
[202:38.06]Oh.
[202:43.54]Alright, so then... Go in here?
[202:51.11]I think?
[202:53.41]What ha- What?
[202:55.15]Um... What do I do?! !
[203:02.71]Now what do I do?
[203:03.89]Which way?
[203:05.57]Which way do I go?
[203:12.04]To the right?
[203:17.32]Oh no, there's a guy coming, there's a guy coming.
[203:18.66]Wait, no.
[203:29.73]I knew it was coming.
[203:30.77]I knew it was going to happen.
[203:32.88]I knew it was going to happen.
[203:34.34]I knew there was going to be something here that caused a huge problem.
[203:39.22]Why would there be music there if there wasn't something bad or scary or... Watch out!
[203:42.65]Look out!
[203:52.69]Imagine being this high strung for a kids game.
[204:00.66]No, this is not a kid's game.
[204:03.30]Kids don't do this.
[204:05.04]This is like a... No.
[204:07.25]Nuh-uh.
[204:14.15]This is like a Newgrounds parody game.
[204:16.29]You know what I'm saying?
[204:20.84]This is not like Super Mario. ...
[204:36.01]Is it enough?
[204:36.85]No!
[204:37.01]Just barely enough.
[204:39.15]It's just barely enough.
[204:41.07]Okay, hold on.
[204:42.11]Don't screw it up.
[205:01.18]Cross.
[205:02.08]Alright.
[205:02.86]Now, it's just you land, you kill both the things, then you land and run instantly.
[205:08.07]At least that's what I think I have to do.
[205:15.03]Alright, let's do it.
[205:18.95]Get them both crushed.
[205:27.66]Okay.
[205:29.04]Fall and then run.
[205:31.16]Here we go.
[205:33.85]One, two, go.
[205:36.49]That was fun.
[205:54.18]That was a good one.
[205:54.70]No, that was cool.
[205:56.34]Really good.
[206:05.78]Nice job.
[206:07.28]Everyone's done a nice job.
[206:08.74]Just because you have a Super Mario 3D World level doesn't mean your level is bad.
[206:13.88]It's just like... You know... Here's a palette cleanser.
[206:25.13]I'll do the palette cleanser for sure.
[206:28.07]T... T2... Q...
[206:37.31]I'm into the Pallet Cleanser level.
[206:41.01]I can't wait to play this one.
[207:04.20]Mountain climbing.
[207:08.52]Oh, I like this one.
[207:17.38]This is a pallet cleanser.
[207:18.45]No, this is what I'm talking about.
[207:19.59]This is great.
[207:21.23]Should I go down?
[207:21.77]I'm gonna go down.
[207:23.09]Saber it.
[207:46.28]Is this a baby level?
[207:51.67]No, not every single level in Mario Maker has to be... Like, burn my eyes with hot stones.
[208:01.41]Everything doesn't have to be, like, as hard as possible.
[208:25.97]Ooh, a couple spikes.
[208:26.55]Wait.
[208:26.83]What about up there?
[208:27.90]I don't know.
[208:33.06]I don't know why, but for some reason apparently all levels in Mario Maker have to be... Like, blast death metal and slam monster energy drinks and scream while you run forward and then jump like a thousand times.
[208:49.62]Sometimes you just want to do some mountain climbing and that was fun.
[208:51.84]I did it!
[208:59.15]I don't have to go take the baseball bat, lean forward with the bat, put my head on it, spin around in a circle 20 times, and then pick up the controller.
[209:06.01]That was fun.
[209:10.64]What did I have?
[209:10.98]It was a nice palate cleanser.
[209:11.82]Alright, we got a medium difficulty right here, and you got it.
[209:21.58]Nice job.
[209:35.37]Okay, this is called Trampolines in the Sky.
[209:53.17]Challenging platforming course.
[209:54.33]Crouch while releasing springs to drop.
[209:56.47]13 minutes!
[210:05.14]Oh shit, okay Holy fuck Only one person has cleared this?
[210:32.71]Um... Should I take it this way?
[210:36.29]Or do I take this?
[210:38.33]Okay.
[210:40.61]Uh, I think I... Have to hit a switch somewhere?
[210:44.35]Ah.
[210:44.41]Um...
[211:12.94]No, no, no, no, don't throw it, no!
[211:14.60]Um... Crouch to drop?
[211:46.16]Try this again.
[211:47.46]Alright.
[211:49.20]There's the switch.
[211:51.90]That was close.
[211:52.68]So now that switch is done.
[211:55.75]So then up here.
[212:21.13]Take a mushroom.
[212:22.09]Now we're going to upgrade the claw machine thing.
[212:27.75]I want that 50.
[212:32.97]It's right there.
[212:33.69]It's giving me... Never mind.
[212:40.76]I want it.
[212:45.69]It's not even that greedy.
[212:46.75]It's just... There.
[212:47.53]Okay, I'm fine.
[212:48.85]Alright.
[212:50.07]So now we... Was I not supposed to... Something happened over there on the right.
[212:54.40]Alright, I don't want to die here.
[213:00.88]What happens now?
[213:02.06]Okay.
[213:02.16]Spring comes out of here?
[213:04.76]I wonder.
[213:05.14]Should I just go up from here?
[213:18.40]Can't.
[213:19.42]Um, up through there?
[213:21.18]No, don't kick it.
[213:23.91]Oops.
[213:24.87]Oh, let me bring this back over here.
[213:48.45]Mmm, kind of.
[213:50.50]Should I go up?
[213:54.16]Hold on.
[213:54.72]I think I have to do this.
[214:01.72]To drop it.
[214:02.84]Why does my face hurt?
[214:05.78]I don't know, man.
[214:09.15]Oh, shit.
[214:09.77]That's not what I wanted.
[214:18.66]There's a checkpoint right there, too.
[214:27.66]Oh my god, what have I done?
[214:37.22]How long is it gonna take me to do this until I do the mechanic that it says in the description?
[214:50.13]I gotta throw shit around.
[215:02.40]Give me the- Where's the other one?
[215:09.38]Where are my trampolines?
[215:10.40]Did I- Where's this one?
[215:12.84]Give it to me.
[215:13.36]What?
[215:36.52]Oops.
[215:37.12]Give it here.
[215:40.95]I'm not even gonna get it.
[215:46.31]No, no, no, no, just fall.
[215:54.62]I'm trying to think if I could do something else there.
[216:07.01]Alright.
[216:08.14]Now, I gotta get up there, so I have to jump from the spring over here.
[216:11.40]Right?
[216:15.72]I'm just gonna try it, see what happens.
[216:22.22]I didn't want to get grabbed, but fine.
[216:26.32]Alright, now if I drop it right now... Ooh!
[216:33.01]That's it.
[216:33.55]Okay.
[216:33.77]I gotta get caught.
[216:48.16]Okay, then get caught again and bring this around?
[216:52.26]And once I'm on here, do I jump across this, I guess?
[217:01.65]And then up there.
[217:21.85]I didn't have to go all the way back down.
[217:25.73]Why am I going so fast?
[217:49.83]Okay, that was... I gotta skip this one.
[217:52.77]It's cool, but I like just... My fucking finger just slipped.
[218:07.52]I like... I was in the air and then I let go and then I hit it again somehow.
[218:13.50]I'll do this one.
[218:28.30]Frigid Cavern Run.
[218:41.41]Oh shit, it's another one of these.
[218:45.98]My first level, there are two 1-ups, you're under a time limit.
[218:48.76]Shit.
[218:49.44]Well, let's give it a try.
[219:01.77]29 seconds?
[219:02.45]Oh, fuck.
[219:04.20]Alright, you got-
[219:35.17]I think you go too fast if you bounce off that one.
[219:45.25]Oh!
[219:46.77]I should have seen that coming from a mile away.
[219:48.43]Oh, Inferno!
[219:58.26]Thank you, Inferno, for the five community subs.
[220:00.18]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[220:03.86]Appreciate it.
[220:11.76]I gotta jump the whole thing.
[220:14.72]No, but thanks for the five subs.
[220:16.58]Thank you.
[220:17.90]Do I need the key?
[220:23.50]Oh, I need the coin.
[220:28.96]Uh-oh.
[220:42.73]The ice is killing me.
[220:47.91]They're taking a shot every time I die.
[220:50.07]I really hope that's not the case.
[220:55.55]How on Earth are you supposed to get that?
[221:00.30]In an ice level.
[221:02.10]That has 30 seconds on the clock.
[221:31.33]Shit, I didn't get it.
[221:35.56]Oh my god.
[222:11.88]I'm going to slow down a little bit, because I don't know what's even...
[222:41.21]Damn, man!
[222:41.97]How are you supposed to do that so fast?
[223:14.69]I missed it again.
[223:15.41]Hopefully I don't need it.
[223:17.49]Let me just get up there and see.
[223:21.07]What the hell is even up here?
[223:22.67]Do I have to jump over the whole thing with a small jump?
[223:28.00]I don't even know if I can do that.
[223:29.36]Come on, really?
[223:30.10]What the hell?
[223:47.32]Alright.
[223:48.12]I think I have to jump, hit the ceiling, and then land and then fall.
[223:53.40]I think.
[223:53.72]I just need to get up there and try again.
[223:55.74]I just don't understand what it wants me to do there. ...
[224:26.54]I don't get it.
[224:28.98]Alright.
[224:31.53]Handful more attention, I gotta move on.
[224:36.23]Did this bounce back and kill me?
[224:53.68]It starts to blend together, man.
[224:55.66]It just mixes up into a bunch of colors in your brain.
[224:59.43]Humans weren't supposed to be doing this.
[225:01.19]You know what I'm saying?
[225:03.37]Like fucking, people were like farming like 500 years ago.
[225:06.55]They weren't, your brain's not supposed to do this.
[225:22.97]People are, like, riding in, like, horse and buggy and... Oh, good evening, madam.
[225:28.17]Yes, sir.
[225:28.81]I'll take two sheep.
[225:31.31]My eyes are fucking wide open and we're hearing the same sounds and the same images over and over again, screaming at us.
[225:40.95]We weren't supposed to be doing this.
[225:56.69]The ice is killing me too.
[225:58.15]The ice.
[225:58.51]It's the ice.
[225:59.23]This fucking ice is killing me.
[226:08.06]I need to figure out this jump because the ice keeps slowing me down.
[226:10.46]See what I'm saying?
[226:12.78]Like, I gotta... How the fuck?
[226:16.16]I figured it out.
[226:16.68]I just did it.
[226:17.28]I did it.
[226:17.64]What do I do?
[226:18.34]I have ten seconds.
[226:22.18]Go.
[226:22.47]Just get up there.
[226:26.31]Did I just beat it?
[226:29.72]Oh my god, I beat it!
[226:31.36]I did it!
[226:31.64]I didn't even mean to do that!
[226:33.92]I did it.
[226:34.34]Okay, I can do this.
[226:51.39]And I'm keeping track of how many levels I've completed by accident.
[226:56.15]That are 1% levels.
[226:57.83]2% levels.
[227:00.27]It's been at least 2 or 3.
[227:01.09]Let me try this one for real.
[227:07.06]No, I can't do this again.
[227:08.96]These speedrunners just get in my brain.
[227:38.33]Alright, last try and that's it.
[227:47.36]I'm out.
[227:54.49]That was that one.
[227:55.05]That didn't count.
[227:57.23]One more try when I get to the top.
[228:01.38]Birthday candles just went out.
[228:03.28]Don't make me laugh right now.
[228:04.58]Stop it.
[228:05.80]What?
[228:06.54]That doesn't count, doesn't count, doesn't count, doesn't count.
[228:13.31]Doesn't count.
[228:13.77]Just wait, wait, wait, wait.
[228:18.21]I have to just- Let me just get up there with the key.

[229:24.18]Oh god damn, whatever.
[229:28.99]I don't care.
[229:29.89]That was a good one.
[229:30.51]That was fun.
[229:30.93]Alright, give me enough.

[230:32.25]Left arrows are tap R, up are hold R. Left is R, up is hold R. Left is right, up is right.
[230:42.04]This is gonna take a little bit of, uh, messing around.
[230:54.22]Left is right.
[230:55.24]Up is right.
[230:55.86]How did I get underneath them?
[231:08.20]I don't even know how I got underneath them.
[231:11.26]Can you jump on top of these in this one?
[231:13.07]No.
[231:17.25]It's the R button?
[231:18.79]No, it's not.
[231:20.81]Why didn't he move?
[231:26.27]Yeah, you can spin jump, okay.
[231:30.05]Hold R, up is... Is this like an activator?
[231:41.94]He went real fast.
[231:48.90]Oh, I thought he was gonna move.
[232:04.80]He's going too fast, okay.
[232:08.44]I still don't... I don't... What was the whole point of that description?
[232:11.28]Alright.
[232:51.93]What the fuck?
[232:55.97]I know it's a reset door, but I'm trying to figure out how to like... hit this.
[233:00.37]Um...
[233:10.57]I have no fucking idea what's happening.
[233:12.61]All I know is that I died.
[233:13.57]Do I have to activate that one?
[233:23.10]I feel like I'm at the end.
[233:31.23]No, I can't make that whole thing.
[233:42.83]Jesus This is pretty awkward, but it's fun did something wrong there What is the difference here
[234:22.75]Maybe I should forget about the guy down here?
[234:25.07]Just activate the one over to the right?
[234:34.01]Who gives a shit?
[234:37.32]You gotta be kidding me.
[234:46.74]I'm doing it.
[234:56.28]No, I can get it.
[234:57.22]Okay, then I'm gonna fall now.
[235:12.35]Why?
[235:12.93]I thought I hit it in the head.
[235:14.40]Come on.
[235:15.00]I'm upset about that.
[235:17.42]I'm actually upset about that.
[235:47.33]He's actually upset.
[235:51.98]No, that one was fun.
[235:53.88]I did the secret.
[236:07.16]Classic Mario?
[236:08.04]We'll try that one.
[236:13.49]I don't think there's been... There's been not very many classic regular Nintendo Mario levels, have there?
[236:18.59]I think there was one or two.
[236:27.20]C-H-V.
[236:30.44]No, no, no.
[236:30.76]Back up.
[236:37.96]Bowser's Sky Gauntlet.
[236:43.02]A five-part gauntlet courtesy of the classic King Koopa.
[236:47.97]Alright.
[236:50.33]Gauntlet?
[236:50.61]Like a boss rush?
[236:58.58]Oh dear.
[236:59.90]Um... Should I... Uh...
[237:20.40]Alright, somebody said the last level and it's fucking with my head right now.
[237:23.68]I don't know why.
[237:24.82]Somebody said that he's the only person to die to a green Koopa.
[237:27.52]Somebody said that like five minutes ago and it's in my head right now because I saw a green Koopa.
[237:37.74]That hitbox is weird.
[237:38.92]Holy shit.
[237:44.81]How did I do that?
[237:57.65]I just tried to jump on that like it was a platform.
[237:59.97]You idiot.
[238:02.25]He's dead, I got him!
[238:04.42]I did it!
[238:06.22]Bad ending.
[238:19.84]Minute and three seconds, not bad.
[238:33.61]Alright, this one says, very important level.
[238:37.15]Let's find out.
[238:38.17]That was good, that was fun.
[238:41.07]Mario 3D World, your favorite.
[238:42.69]I'm not even gonna, I'm not gonna open that one.
[238:56.00]D, N, F.
[239:03.31]A useful lesson.
[239:05.58]A simple level with a very important message.
[239:13.66]This one's kind of freaking me out a little.
[239:18.42]I'm kind of afraid of this one.
[239:26.44]Okay.
[239:29.42]What's your important message that is...
[239:38.09]Yeah, that's a good message.
[240:04.02]That's a really good message, actually.
[240:05.16]That's pretty important.
[240:07.28]Don't do that.
[240:19.61]That's simple level with a very important message.
[240:21.43]95%.
[240:21.45]So would you just, like, get there and, like, not...
[240:34.25]You must have, like, saw it, and maybe you were just like, ah, I don't want to play this one, it's a word one.
[240:42.38]Alright, here's this one.
[240:47.06]3, 3, 2... W, N, 9... 5, GG!
[240:52.34]GG!
[241:05.76]Big Boom Boom's castle.
[241:11.48]Collect Mario's mount and armor to defeat the Lord of Castle Boom.
[241:18.85]Get the mount and the armor.
[241:25.05]Sure.
[241:31.45]But I'm not... How do I... I change character by here, right?
[241:35.05]Settings.
[241:39.52]Where do you actually do this?
[241:40.32]I don't want to be Toad anymore.
[241:46.66]Let's be Super Mario.
[241:53.48]Okay.
[241:55.26]Sorry, Toad.
[241:56.04]You're out.
[242:00.58]That's a normie thing to do.
[242:08.89]No, the normie thing would be, I'm gonna be like somebody, I'm gonna be like Toad!
[242:12.97]Why am I just running over this?
[242:16.14]And go!
[242:16.42]Too fast.
[242:38.67]Where are we going?
[242:40.51]Wow, that's a big drop.
[242:42.07]Okay.
[242:48.93]Mario is the gibbous of Mario games.
[242:53.35]That doesn't even make any sense.
[242:54.71]At all.
[242:56.49]That's too fa- I can't even- It's too fast!
[242:59.47]I gotta wait until it's almost all the way done.
[243:00.85]This is not the gibbous.
[243:02.73]Mario is the actual engine that the game runs on.
[243:14.28]Alright, now let's go here and then back up.
[243:19.33]Um, I didn't know where to go there.
[243:21.21]Alright, now, uh, let's check this out first.
[243:41.70]okay and then through this is the armor this kind of like the shield of the armor how do I get that coin
[244:11.07]I can't believe somebody just said spin.
[244:15.84]And I listened to them.
[244:17.26]Why did I listen to you?
[244:19.04]There was no reason for you to listen to you.
[244:22.10]Everybody gets that.
[244:22.78]Why are you not listening to chat?
[244:24.94]Oh, now I'm all fucking tilted.
[244:26.70]Now I'm all fucking tilted.
[244:28.70]How did... Never mind.
[244:33.78]There's too many coming out here.
[244:35.70]Alright, this is ridiculous.
[244:37.55]I'm fucked.
[244:39.09]Holy shit, they're stuck.
[244:46.37]No, blow it up!
[244:47.89]Hurry!
[244:54.33]I'm gonna wait till he explodes.
[245:02.52]I can't... I can't do this kind of shit.
[245:05.52]Why?!
[245:08.42]I'm telling you.
[245:09.46]I can't... Where's the armor?
[245:10.40]In here?
[245:11.67]Armor!
[245:12.51]No, it's not.
[245:17.78]I think my controller's running out of battery.
[245:19.40]I just pressed jump and it took three seconds to happen.
[245:22.12]Okay.
[245:22.46]Alright, easy.
[245:47.33]Alright, we're going down blue.
[245:48.15]There's a key here.
[245:51.71]Um... Where's that fire?
[246:02.05]Should I get that?
[246:02.85]I think I'm gonna get that.
[246:04.61]Take a risk.
[246:05.09]No.
[246:05.88]Don't take any risks.
[246:06.78]Don't be an idiot.
[246:08.60]Put this on.
[246:09.02]Here's the armor.
[246:10.36]I got it.
[246:24.67]How do I get back there?
[246:27.24]Oh, I can break these right with the helmet.
[246:31.02]Alright, two keys.
[246:50.89]Um, uh, excuse me.
[246:54.06]Excuse me.
[246:54.70]That's not fair.
[246:55.60]That's not fair.
[246:56.36]Unfair.
[246:56.96]Spawn.
[246:58.18]Why?
[247:08.64]Can I do this now?
[247:10.06]What if I don't have my mount or my helmet?
[247:12.84]Is it still, can I still beat it?
[247:24.96]I think I just got stuck.
[247:27.98]No, I didn't.
[247:32.44]Okay.
[247:54.93]I can't move.
[247:55.83]I thought that was fire.
[247:56.49]I was about to fucking scream.
[248:00.84]Anything over here?
[248:01.44]Or is this guy?
[248:03.38]I have to pee?
[248:18.49]Get away from me.
[248:19.77]Get away from me.
[248:24.48]Um... What am I- What should I do with the- What should I do with the pea?
[248:29.22]I don't know how to do the pea.
[248:31.36]Can I fly with the pea?
[248:35.54]You piece of shit.
[248:39.82]Um...
[248:56.70]I got it!
[248:58.66]Fall!
[248:59.56]Please fall, right?
[249:00.24]No.
[249:01.58]I got all three keys.
[249:02.80]I got the key, and now I... What should I do with the block?
[249:17.33]Why was I stuck to the ceiling?
[249:40.97]What?
[249:45.35]Oh.
[249:52.48]Um... What?
[249:55.22]How?
[249:56.16]Why?
[249:57.66]Oh my god!
[249:58.92]I just fucking panicked.
[250:01.02]Like, the ultimate panic.
[250:02.24]Did I get it?
[250:06.12]Okay, I need to stop!
[250:08.27]Stop, please!
[250:14.95]That was fun that was a fun one it was nice
[250:47.05]That was good.
[250:47.75]That was interesting.
[250:48.43]Except for, like, that, you know, spawning.
[250:52.02]Bomb spawning.
[250:52.98]I mean, I don't know.
[250:54.24]I kind of got killed.
[250:54.92]I didn't feel like I deserved that.
[251:04.84]You are great at Mario, and you are very tall.
[251:07.08]Hey.
[251:08.76]Gonna have to give it to that one.
[251:24.42]I like it when he gets mad.
[251:32.12]Escape the swamps while avoiding the hungry piranha plants.
[251:36.45]Too bad you're not great at Mario.
[251:37.65]It's alright.
[251:39.21]That's fine.
[251:47.79]We already got over our leg meltdown.
[251:53.74]Oh, no he didn't.
[251:54.30]Never mind.
[251:55.12]Avoid the Piranha Plants.
[251:58.68]Seems like a pretty wholesome level, right?
[252:41.22]What the fuck?
[252:43.12]Greed?
[252:43.54]What are you talking about, greed?
[252:45.80]Wait, what's down here?
[252:47.29]Secret!
[252:47.71]Nah, I screwed it up.
[252:49.49]How hard is it to make a Mario Maker level?
[253:10.57]It'll take a while.
[253:12.81]That was fun.
[253:13.43]That was a good one.
[253:25.00]Thank you for that level.
[253:25.70]It was good.
[253:35.13]Play this one for the joke.
[253:37.29]For the jokes, OK?
[253:42.61]Alright, after this, can somebody link me one of those that you stand still and it plays a song?
[253:53.60]Can somebody link me?
[253:54.52]There's got to be.
[253:55.44]The Game of Thrones theme?
[253:57.56]I want to see that.
[253:58.16]It has to exist.
[254:09.52]Morality based what is this yoshi's choice?
[254:25.41]Question mark, what am I doing here?
[254:26.87]Just go
[254:41.27]Oh, that's interesting.
[255:13.92]Hold on, I can do that in five seconds.
[255:17.14]I can do that shit in five seconds.
[255:18.39]Okay.
[255:43.85]How long was that?
[255:56.22]How on Earth do you do that quicker?
[256:08.33]No, I'm done.
[256:08.95]I'm just gonna do the level.
[256:25.94]So you're gonna fall down and then... I'll try it.
[256:30.79]I need Yoshi again.
[256:37.54]Wait till they come by and then fall down.
[256:41.20]No.
[257:07.53]That's longer than I thought it was going to be.
[257:15.62]One more try.
[257:16.06]Oops-a-daisy, oops-a-daisy.
[257:16.96]Alright, that was fun.
[257:18.24]Next, coming up.
[257:40.08]Uh...
[258:09.01]No, you're just spelling up pretending.
[258:11.51]I get it.
[258:11.85]Okay, can we get a real one or what?
[258:28.32]Isn't this one real?
[258:35.01]Hey, regardless, you better try that combination.
[258:38.43]I remember your name.
[258:40.25]I will remember.
[258:40.95]Let's see.
[258:50.48]This is for me.
[258:52.64]Actually, for Jerma.
[258:58.02]This should be challenging enough.
[259:00.24]Okay.
[259:16.40]I regret putting this one in.
[259:26.21]You can't get more than one second.
[259:52.56]How?
[259:52.82]One bounce on the head?
[259:55.99]Right, that's gotta be it.
[260:21.11]Are you doing this right now at the same time?
[260:22.95]One, I don't, that's, you can't go faster than that.
[260:24.91]It's not possible.
[260:27.25]Okay, okay, okay.
[260:44.03]Okay, I'm done.
[260:46.99]I'm done, I don't care.
[260:56.90]It was, uh, no.
[260:58.54]It's 1.3370.
[260:59.35]Nobody can get as fast as that.
[261:00.75]Alright, give me another one.
[261:11.45]This is a relaxing trip to Chill Peak.
[261:17.72]Don't mind if I do.
[261:32.73]Chill peak mountain have a relaxing vacation a beautiful chill peak mountain Okay Mario 3 already like it
[262:00.34]This song is freaking me out because it doesn't belong here.
[262:09.01]It's pretty chill.

[262:31.13]What is this?
[262:35.75]Uh, the Rainbow Road?
[262:37.45]No, no, no.
[262:38.19]The one where you're... The slide?
[262:40.74]Yeah, it's the slide.
[262:45.14]Right, right, right.
[262:53.74]Or, what I think would be better use of this music is a non-stop gif of a hamster running in a wheel.
[263:02.32]I think it would be like really that's like a cool loving cute video idea for some of you that have hamsters No, I gotta fly there's gonna be something over here

[264:47.65]This is a 3% level.
[264:48.27]Ay-yi-yi.
[265:00.48]Reach the goal after activating all 999 POW blocks.
[265:09.12]Did this take like six years to make this?
[265:15.97]You tried to kill me there, didn't you?
[265:26.33]The world record is an hour.

[267:14.14]Don't worry.
[267:20.26]And then, hit this and I'll head out of the way.
[267:31.73]I'm gonna go through here.
[267:41.38]I don't know what you want me to do there.
[267:44.58]I guess I'm... Should I...
[268:06.46]You're probably wondering why I did- I'm just trying to run- I got like a hundred keys.
[268:12.51]I ran back and forth once and I got a bunch of keys, so I'm just gonna see what that's all about.
[268:26.62]Oh my god, okay.
[268:28.64]Why is it giving- what's with all the keys?
[268:34.16]No, it's called experimentation.
[268:36.06]So I'm just going to get it and come back.
[268:41.28]It just gives me... I can't even talk.
[268:43.14]Can you hear this?

[269:24.36]You just have to wait like eight, five seconds?
[269:27.66]Um, alright, whatever.
[269:46.47]I... I don't know.

[272:10.51]Do you really care about this level?
[272:11.79]Hold on.
[272:21.73]It's paused.
[272:22.31]Darn.
[272:34.47]That's funny.
[272:35.70]That's funny.
[272:38.42]Yeah, this is funny.
[272:44.74]The world record is actually an hour long.
[272:46.44]How do you do this for an hour?
[272:58.03]No, it's going to be faster than that.
[273:06.33]Faster.
[273:06.79]I need a faster run.
[273:11.09]I just want to see what this looks like.
[273:13.07]I need to know.
[273:22.17]The hamster has to be running really fast.
[273:30.99]None of these are that fast.
[273:32.89]They're slow.
[273:34.96]Does anybody have a fast one?
[273:41.99]Is this fast?
[273:51.43]Speed up the video on YouTube.
[274:04.20]Oh, here we go.
[274:13.21]Yeah, this is perfect.
[274:15.39]This is absolutely perfect.
[274:17.29]Good.
[274:18.21]Alright, let's do it.
[274:25.25]This is a good break.
[274:26.39]I'm taking a break.
[274:39.17]Let's go.
[274:44.29]There's no... Damn, funny kids at the aquarium.
[274:48.59]Okay, here we go.
[274:50.25]Here we go!
[275:10.13]That was really cute.
[275:12.32]That was a very cute video.
[275:14.78]I would share that on Facebook.
[275:41.99]I couldn't handle it.
[275:49.17]I'm sorry
[276:06.62]Fucking losing their mind about how much they hate the hamster.
[276:11.36]I don't know.
[276:12.12]My fucking grandma was like this.
[276:16.10]It sucked.
[276:17.83]Oh my god, that was fucking sick.
[276:24.35]Now every time I hear this song...
[276:30.83]This is dumb.
[276:31.67]That's dumb.
[276:32.61]Okay.
[276:33.41]I'm gonna tell you that that's dumb.
[276:35.61]I don't want to do this one anymore.
[276:36.67]That's dumb.
[276:39.47]That's just dumb.
[276:40.36]I don't want to do that.
[276:50.78]I got it.
[276:51.06]I turned it down.
[277:02.87]You guys are fucking hilarious.
[277:07.14]You're giving up on a minute-long level?
[277:08.64]This is not a minute-long level.
[277:23.55]Okay, do it, pow, and then go right in the door.
[277:25.85]Go!
[277:34.64]Where's the trick?
[277:35.50]There's a trick somewhere.
[277:37.58]Where's the trick?
[277:43.48]There was a trick.
[277:45.31]I got hit by the trick already.
[277:48.25]This is the trick.
[277:49.35]Yes, it is.
[277:50.01]You're right.
[277:52.31]I got tricked.
[277:52.73]Alright, this is the last attempt and I'm out.
[278:03.78]We'll do another one.
[278:05.54]I'm stuck right now.
[278:07.42]You know what I mean?
[278:08.62]I'm fucking stuck.
[278:09.72]Okay.
[278:39.34]So I go up into here, and then what?
[278:42.13]It does not go in there?
[278:43.37]Did I do it?
[278:46.99]Okay, apparently I just hold on to the wall when I want.
[278:50.22]I'm going to get crushed.
[278:50.88]There's somebody in there.
[278:56.84]How do I... No, that's a joke.
[279:00.87]I can't get that.
[279:18.84]Shit.
[279:20.18]Now, how am I supposed to get that?
[279:24.43]I'm gonna take the d- Won't I take the damage from the- Do I have to grab that from the very bottom pixel?
[279:39.48]Alright, this is my actual final attempt, I promise.
[279:43.66]I swear, this is the final attempt.
[279:45.52]I wanna see what happens there, yeah.
[279:48.13]I'm curious.
[280:13.77]Alright, let's do this again.
[280:15.05]Hold on to the side.
[280:17.85]There we go.
[280:20.00]Alright, so... How do I get this?
[280:24.54]Just by jumping up and... No.
[280:29.54]I can't go this way.
[280:41.74]Oh, come on.
[280:43.00]No, that's... Why?
[280:44.82]No!
[280:46.14]That's... That's not fair.
[280:52.19]Alright, I... That's... I know that's the last one, but that wasn't my fault.
[281:09.27]I know.
[281:09.55]That was not my fault.
[281:10.97]That was not even my last attempt.
[281:13.59]That was... The game... You know what I'm saying?
[281:16.94]Like, that was not a real attempt.
[281:19.14]If I died by... Oh, I got hit by a spike!
[281:21.42]Okay, that's me.
[281:23.40]I didn't lose to that.
[281:25.12]The game lost for me.
[281:28.08]Like, if I fell down right there, that's an attempt.
[281:30.54]If I get hit in the head by a wrench or something, whatever, that's my fault.
[281:52.72]Okay, here we go.
[281:54.72]I know there's no battery.
[281:56.73]Alright.
[282:00.87]Break the blocks.
[282:02.39]And then... Now what?
[282:05.63]Hold on.
[282:06.11]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[282:12.28]What happens now?
[282:15.98]Huh?
[282:22.02]No, you said I break the... I break the... Why didn't I shrink?
[282:26.24]Break the one on the left, somebody said.
[282:28.18]And then I freaked out.
[282:29.80]That one doesn't count.
[282:31.67]That was... Somebody in chat died there.
[282:34.27]Not me.
[282:35.97]Somebody said break the one on the left, break the one on the left.
[282:37.79]No, no, that was somebody in chat did that.
[282:39.29]I didn't do that.
[282:39.97]That was not something I was going to do.
[282:45.40]No, that was not me doing that.
[282:54.45]Hey, hit the one on the left!
[282:55.43]And I was like, okay, this is your turn, so you do it.
[283:08.78]Nobody told you to follow his advice.
[283:12.70]No, but still.
[283:15.66]Okay.
[283:16.94]This is it.
[283:18.53]This is on my own.
[283:22.03]Whatever I do here, this is my doing.
[283:24.61]No one else is going to do this for me.
[283:26.11]This is my doing.
[284:11.99]Okay.
[284:12.75]Alright.
[284:13.19]Alright.
[284:21.84]Alright.
[284:22.26]Okay.
[284:24.02]Joel just came in with a raid.
[284:25.02]What's up, Joel?
[284:27.56]I tried your level.
[284:29.74]And I didn't do very well.
[284:32.92]It was very, very hard.
[284:36.42]It was super ridiculously hard.
[284:38.84]But it was very fun.
[284:39.78]Very well thought out.
[284:40.74]I heard it took you 20 hours.
[284:45.05]I watched the part where you went all the way down and around and died at the end.
[284:50.50]And I vicariously lived through like 12 hours of your life and decided I wasn't going to do it.
[285:00.37]But welcome, everybody.
[285:02.53]We're doing just random viewer levels.
[285:05.31]He said it was a pile of shit.
[285:06.73]I did not say that.
[285:09.31]Don't listen to that.
[285:14.89]Alright, how about this one?
[285:16.61]But, thank you so much for the raid.
[285:19.84]If you stick around, we're gonna do this for a little bit while longer.
[285:23.08]Probably another couple hours or something.
[285:25.80]Alright, prove that you're a gamer and beat this level.
[285:28.39]I'll try.
[285:28.85]Is this one of those levels that laughs at you and makes you stuck somewhere?
[285:48.56]20 seconds?
[285:50.36]Megalovania.
[285:54.68]How does... Alright, let's go.
[286:01.26]Speedrun?
[286:01.86]Oh, it's a song.
[286:04.05]How does only 1% seen a song get done?
[286:11.92]Oh, by the way, if you've never seen Undertale, don't look.
[286:13.78]Just follow the coins.
[286:14.42]Huh?
[286:14.62]What?
[286:14.92]Okay.
[286:26.50]Only 19 more seconds, that's right.
[286:51.28]I was running, what?
[286:54.84]Stop, there are spoilers everywhere!
[287:02.65]What?
[287:02.87]No one!
[287:03.33]Oh god, I have to go up and around!
[287:04.73]Oh!
[287:05.25]Oh!
[287:14.64]What do you do here?
[287:29.10]Oh, you idiot.
[287:29.96]You idiot.
[287:30.88]You idiot.
[287:40.56]You idiot.
[287:44.13]I at least want to hear the first part of the song.
[287:56.82]Whoa!
[287:56.96]Spin jump, spin jump!
[288:08.34]That was close.
[288:14.82]Awww, it hit me in the fucking face!
[288:30.39]What was the point of you- should I hold on to that?
[288:51.83]It actually came down and hit me!
[288:56.17]I don't- why am I bringing it?
[288:57.33]I don't even need to bring that stupid thing!
[288:59.35]Oh my god, I'm an idiot.
[289:12.42]I did it again.
[289:28.51]What happened?
[289:30.69]What happened?
[290:02.31]I... maybe... I gotta see that end.
[290:20.83]Shoot it?
[290:25.95]I have to spin jump down there?
[290:27.63]I only have one second remaining!
[290:43.10]Am I gonna be able to get to the end of that?
[291:00.64]Oh sh- Um, I need to know what- I hit the POW when they were on the screen.
[291:06.12]They were clearly on that screen!
[291:07.28]They were on that screen, you saw them!
[291:10.30]What happened there?
[291:12.69]I can still do it.
[291:30.43]Alright, so I hit the POW, but it didn't kill them down there.
[291:34.42]Doesn't it usually blow up everything?
[291:37.08]Not fast enough.
[291:53.48]It's the time.
[291:54.32]Oh man.
[292:04.71]That was bullshit.
[292:05.79]I got like stuck in the goddamn wall.
[292:13.78]I'll get it.
[292:14.62]How did I not touch those?
[292:20.63]I'm clearly touching them.
[292:22.67]I don't... I'm upset about that.
[292:26.71]I'm gonna dock the time again.
[292:31.39]Dead.
[292:43.67]I just hit myself in the face.
[292:45.03]I... Don't jump.
[292:47.51]I have to, like, keep moving and I have to hold up and I have to...
[293:08.33]Fuck, it's right here.
[293:13.40]I crouched for a tenth of a second.
[293:15.02]It was like... It's alright.
[293:36.39]Okay.
[294:10.72]Jesus!
[294:15.91]It's right there.
[294:17.29]I can smell it.
[294:18.21]Touch it!
[294:48.02]That sucked.
[294:49.36]That sucked.
[294:50.14]That was that sucked.
[294:52.76]That's unfortunate.
[294:54.00]Come on, boop, boop, boop, boop.
[294:57.99]Touch it!
[294:59.03]I did it!
[295:19.36]That one was fun.
[295:24.05]I think I actually had to ground pound.
[295:30.25]That was pretty good.
[295:32.49]There you go.
[295:43.86]Prove you're a true gamer.
[295:46.14]Sometimes I'm a gamer.
[295:47.22]Not all the time, though.
[295:56.39]Alright, this one says, I swear to the Lord.
[295:58.23]Alright, let's try this one.
[296:08.80]Uh...
[296:24.22]Uh, Blinko Shell Drop.
[296:26.05]Drop the shell in a slot and see if you can get the jackpot.
[296:33.01]I feel like I'm gonna really like this one.
[296:36.49]I am.
[296:40.26]Get 60 coins.
[296:45.88]Reach the goal after grabbing 60 coins.
[296:49.97]Easy enough, I guess.
[296:50.99]Does it matter which one of these I pick?
[296:55.42]I know I got low battery.
[297:22.50]How do I know where it goes?
[297:24.00]Is this like the dev door?
[297:25.50]No, alright.
[297:26.28]I have to follow it.
[297:27.64]I just have to see what I get.
[297:50.45]I guess I could float down with it.
[297:54.07]But then I have to come back up.
[297:56.49]Give me 50 coins right now.
[298:20.64]Right at the bottom.
[298:21.16]50.
[298:21.18]50!
[298:21.20]50!
[298:21.22]50!
[298:21.28]Nooo!
[298:21.96]What's the point of having Yoshi?
[298:23.74]What does Yoshi do here?
[299:04.02]Yeah, but... No!
[299:05.80]Ah, shit.
[299:06.56]I'm gonna do it again.
[299:35.92]Is the door at the bottom?
[299:38.42]Wait, you want me to swim all the way down there?
[299:39.94]I'm going to go second here.
[299:43.93]Right there.
[299:50.73]Wait, the door means elevator up.
[299:55.19]Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[299:56.61]You know, you're right.
[299:58.69]Yes, yep.
[300:04.16]That would make sense, wouldn't it?
[300:06.97]There would be a door here.
[300:08.25]You're right.
[300:08.85]Come on, give me the big 50.
[300:16.87]Why do they all keep going over here?
[300:40.86]Let him go down.
[300:42.24]No!
[300:42.72]I wanted to... Come on.
[300:44.46]Go get him.
[300:46.77]It was gonna work, too.
[300:49.49]It was gonna work!
[300:51.17]And now he has the thing in his mouth!
[300:53.93]Despawn.
[300:57.45]I promised I wasn't gonna scream anymore, and I just did.
[301:26.14]I was trying to drop him down so maybe he would just float all the way down and grab the 50.
[301:29.39]You're not actually doing this, are you?
[301:58.33]I thought I was going to get stuck again.
[302:04.92]It is.
[302:06.62]No, it's not.
[302:07.24]Thank God.
[302:08.26]Don't do it again.
[302:10.78]Don't do it again.
[302:11.82]It's going to do it again.
[302:15.34]Thank God.
[302:16.10]Come on.
[302:16.60]I'm almost done.
[302:19.45]Give me the 50.
[302:19.77]It's what Yoshi would have wanted.

[303:37.63]One VG.
[303:42.45]Life is Pain.
[303:45.43]Why did I pick the one that said Life is Pain?
[303:47.56]The level can only be beaten by sliding backwards.
[303:56.46]Okay.
[304:03.73]The Frozen Backwards Only Cave.
[304:15.30]I thought I had to slide backward.
[304:20.97]Can you jump?
[304:50.86]no ignore the level name and just go alright fine you can't walk you have to go backwards that's what the thing says
[305:26.56]I'm losing momentum!
[305:35.18]I know.
[305:35.60]I'm sorry.
[305:36.10]Every time I get really intense, it sounds like somebody punching me in the stomach.
[305:39.16]I'm sorry.
[305:53.11]Walk to the left.
[306:12.57]Somebody said keep jumping to do momentum.
[306:15.89]Oh, no.
[306:16.27]Right here.
[306:18.75]What if I turn and look?

[307:23.51]No!
[307:24.20]Almost there!
[307:55.86]No, do it again.
[307:56.52]I keep hitting down.
[308:06.49]It's just in my brain.
[308:09.87]Because it's slide.
[308:10.77]You have to slide.
[308:11.71]Doesn't that mean you have to hold down?
[308:15.94]Like, slide backwards to win.
[308:28.14]Oops!
[308:28.60]Alright, I got it.
[308:29.84]I got it.
[308:30.42]I got it.
[308:31.10]I'll do it.
[308:35.64]I got it.
[308:36.24]I lost it already, I think.
[308:57.84]I've had it.
[309:05.35]I just had to do it earlier.
[309:06.37]It's alright.
[309:10.48]It's not that bad.
[309:24.48]I fucked it up again.
[309:25.42]You gotta go longer with the slide.
[309:34.98]Same thing with this, you gotta do longer.
[309:36.24]Nope.
[309:39.97]It's alright, I still get it.
[309:48.05]Really?
[309:55.74]You don't have to jump into sliding, but won't I stop moving?
[309:57.92]No, it's alright.
[310:00.50]No, it's not alright.
[310:30.84]See, I keep having problems with that first slide.
[310:33.30]It's okay, the game didn't fuck up yet.
[310:36.50]Cheater.
[310:37.06]No, actually it was bad because it stopped me.
[311:03.57]Okay, here it is, here it is, here it is, here it is.
[311:04.69]This is the part.
[311:08.53]Alright, alright, alright!
[311:13.81]No, you motherfucker!
[311:14.85]It's right there!
[311:15.41]That was it too.
[311:23.98]Shit.
[311:35.52]This is so addicting, but it's gonna kill me.
[311:57.02]The stupid fucking low battery.
[311:59.80]I don't care if it's low battery.
[312:01.40]Stop telling me.
[312:02.14]You told me like ten times.
[312:03.92]I don't need you to distract me.
[312:06.11]I know the battery's low.
[312:07.67]I know.
[312:07.97]You don't have to tell me every five minutes.
[312:09.63]I promise.
[312:10.25]I know.
[312:10.57]That's got me tilted now.
[312:50.11]I'm telling you, humanity is gonna get to a point where, like, this is not gonna be enough.
[312:55.60]We're gonna start slapping each other in the faces with fucking frying pans in, like, 20 years.
[313:01.40]This is not gonna be enough.
[313:10.86]This is gonna be frying pan streams.
[313:13.28]Where, like, I hit you in the face with a frying pan, and you hit me in the face with a fucking frying pan.
[313:18.07]It's not enough anymore!
[313:29.81]What?
[313:33.41]What?
[313:33.57]I just stopped, like, dead in my tracks.
[313:34.89]That was weird.
[313:47.78]Oh, no, no, no.
[313:49.00]I need to take a fucking break.
[313:51.47]It's so fucking much for my body and brain to do this a million times.
[314:00.29]And it's with my least favorite Pokémon, too.
[314:02.09]It's with my least favorite Mario game.
[314:26.78]What is it doing that?
[314:27.60]Why is it freezing me?
[314:35.03]That's the second time that's happened.
[314:36.00]Am I doing something wrong here?
[314:37.12]What's- I don't understand it.
[314:51.86]Fuck!
[314:52.34]Fuck!
[314:52.82]Fuck!
[314:53.34]Fuck!
[314:54.96]I got it!
[314:57.63]I did it!
[314:57.91]Oh my god, I did it!
[314:58.89]Yes!
[315:02.35]Wait, hold on, what do I do now?
[315:04.68]Can I not touch that?
[315:06.46]I can touch that, right?
[315:08.12]What does that mean?
[315:48.50]I just heard the the laugh that means I can't do it I heard like the fucking cat noise
[316:19.78]That was genuine.
[316:25.18]It eats away at my fucking soul.
[316:50.40]Oh, I'm going too fast.
[316:51.44]No, I gotta slow down.
[316:56.64]So, I'm so glad I have to do the beginning again, though.
[316:59.88]So, I'm not sliding... Is this bad that I'm not sliding forwards?
[317:14.57]I mean, backwards, I mean?
[317:17.17]It's not gonna deduct points or something, right?
[317:34.51]How do I open this door?
[317:35.22]How do I open the door?
[317:50.45]Just walk, just walk, just walk, just walk?
[318:06.61]Wait.
[318:07.15]Does this matter?
[318:10.32]This doesn't fucking matter.
[318:12.82]39 seconds.
[318:13.04]That was crazy.
[318:33.99]Here's a calming level.
[318:35.95]Oh, that's funny.
[318:37.00]Jebaited.
[318:37.48]I like it.
[318:41.88]I made this one.
[318:42.56]We'll try it.
[318:47.48]What was the completion on this?
[318:48.38]2%.
[318:48.44]That was fun.
[318:58.03]XSL.
[319:00.45]PNM.
[319:04.80]Eight?
[319:06.74]TG.
[319:07.04]Uh, I made this one.
[319:11.60]Forecast calls for lots of fish bones.
[319:13.26]Left, right, left.
[319:14.30]When does it end?
[319:17.68]Short and sweet.
[319:19.46]Fish bone barrage.
[319:25.55]Uh-oh.
[319:42.26]I know how to do this.
[319:57.63]I can't do this in, like, hot dog mode?
[320:03.99]You can't play Mario Maker in hot dog mode?
[320:09.75]Alright, hold on.
[320:11.26]No, I got it.
[320:11.78]I got it.
[320:12.06]I got it.
[320:12.30]Don't worry.
[320:12.54]I'm fine.
[320:13.62]I'll be right back.
[320:14.00]I'm going to charge these up.
[320:17.40]Hold on a sec.
[320:17.94]Just wait.
[320:19.30]Alright, take a pee break.
[320:20.14]I'll be right back.
[320:22.03]I got the controllers here.
[320:23.57]I'm good.
[320:23.75]I'll be right back.
[323:58.52]Alright.
[324:01.40]I'm good to go.
[324:04.76]It's starting to communicate.
[324:05.94]Yeah, I'm good.
[324:06.36]I've heard her.
[324:12.73]OK.
[324:12.97]Was I on a level?
[324:14.89]I think I was, right?
[324:19.69]Right.
[324:19.97]Fishbone Barrage.
[324:22.47]Well, there goes a CD.
[324:23.39]I don't know what the fuck it was.
[324:30.98]Alright.
[324:35.74]Uh... I think that's a joke.
[324:39.22]I can't get them.
[324:40.64]Maybe I can.
[324:55.09]Will those kill me if they touch me?
[324:57.15]Probably, right?
[324:58.56]Where's like the indicator of where they land?
[325:04.60]It's like a telegraph?
[325:07.90]What are they gonna fall?
[325:13.91]It just takes up the screen.
[325:15.21]Left, right, left, right, left, right.
[325:17.17]Okay.
[325:21.64]Left, right.
[325:22.52]Oh, I get it.
[325:23.08]Alright, that's a neat little, uh... So that was right.
[325:28.50]So they're gonna go left side now.
[325:32.91]Two, three, left.
[325:36.27]Now they're gonna be on the right side.
[325:37.35]And that's the thing that kills me.
[325:40.23]I'm looking up.
[325:49.42]So when you hear... That's right.
[325:57.02]Right?
[325:58.37]Because now that's left.
[326:02.21]The beeps are left and the airs are right.
[326:04.43]Gotta hang up.
[326:14.60]Oh, shit.
[326:15.36]Not good.
[326:21.27]That was... That was a different beep than the other ones were.
[326:24.59]Right?
[326:33.95]I thought that was going right.
[326:36.11]Cause th- that- really, listen to this one.
[326:38.89]This one goes boop!
[326:43.17]Ready?
[326:44.25]See?
[326:45.37]I... I'm not sure the sounds matter.
[326:48.05]I think it just goes left, right, left, right.
[327:04.48]Hurry up!
[327:05.28]But... Ooh, shit.
[327:07.12]No, please!
[327:08.25]I tried to aim it.
[327:09.05]I tried to block it.
[327:09.91]Alright, here we go.
[327:10.49]It's gonna be on the left.
[327:35.63]Oh, shit.
[327:39.90]Oh, boy.
[327:41.16]I don't know if I had a little bit more time, I guess.
[327:45.98]I thought I had way less time.
[327:50.47]What the fuck?
[328:03.09]Oh, fuck.
[328:03.51]I've got to go this way.
[328:04.93]Because that's not going to be over.
[328:06.15]No!
[328:08.49]Come on!
[328:08.91]I've got to stand underneath it!
[328:19.63]Which way is it going to go?
[328:23.07]Oh, man.
[328:23.61]You have to jump right underneath when it goes.
[328:28.18]Damn it.
[328:34.09]alright I thought it spawned me like right in the thing I feel like it takes me two or three times to do that every single time I'm holding b and it just doesn't go up why
[329:07.04]Oh shit.
[329:08.12]Okay.
[329:15.20]Block it.
[329:17.22]Block it, please!
[329:19.84]Alright, I gotta make the jump up right before they land.
[329:30.67]Now what?
[329:32.29]All the way to the right?
[329:34.29]Anything else to block?
[329:35.13]Oh god, I'm just going...
[329:40.83]Just go in get out of here There it is
[330:11.93]That's not gonna... Was that gonna kill me?
[330:13.05]I thought I was gonna die.
[330:19.79]That was a really good one.
[330:22.60]Cheers to that.
[330:24.28]How do I... What do I... I can't like it?
[330:25.50]Oops.
[330:25.70]Alright, we'll try this one.
[330:34.61]This one requires no gamer skills, and I like the sound of that.
[330:41.43]mvg 4c6 twg what does that say wait did I get that wrong b wait what
[331:10.97]Did I read... MBG 4C6 TWG.

[331:28.83]MBG 4C6 TWG.
[331:29.45]Yeah, it didn't work.
[331:33.48]Weird.
[331:33.94]Alright, um... We'll do this one.
[331:37.30]5TV...
[331:51.12]It's MGB, not... It's MGB, not MGB.
[331:56.91]You're confusing the absolute fuck out of me right now.
[331:59.31]Alright, Mario and the Haunted Treasure.
[332:05.94]Mario discovers a cave full of gold, but he needs a P-Switch to reach it.
[332:12.83]Is it a storyline one?
[332:26.21]I probably shouldn't have done that.
[332:34.75]Okay.
[332:35.60]Hold on, let me look.
[332:36.74]Uh, what's down here?
[332:46.08]Oh, I just dropped the big one.
[332:52.20]Oh, I should not have done that.
[332:54.10]I should not have done that.
[332:58.41]Is this a new motorcycle ride fun?
[333:04.10]Can we ride it yet?
[333:08.89]I'm just going to go through here.
[333:10.95]Well, that was bad.
[333:16.20]It's good.
[333:30.92]Alright, um... I think I have to go down here.
[333:37.35]Really?
[333:40.86]Yeah, the Hagrid, uh, the new Universal ride, yeah.
[333:43.60]I'm surprised more people didn't know what I was talking about.
[334:15.45]I got the- I just- I got the P block!
[334:18.91]I did it, right?
[334:19.43]That's it!
[334:20.38]What am I standing still for?
[334:47.90]I feel like I'm doing the secret part.
[334:56.09]I feel like I'm doing the secret part.
[334:57.43]Uh oh, he shook me!
[335:19.46]Should I... Just bring this with me?
[335:31.18]Alright.
[335:34.02]I did it.
[335:39.38]Oh, shit.
[335:45.25]I did it!
[336:10.72]I feel like there was a few ways to go there.
[336:15.58]That's cool.
[336:17.08]Short and sweet.
[336:17.52]That was pretty short.
[336:20.39]Alright, we got this one.
[336:28.08]Here's the correct spelling.
[336:29.60]M-G-B-4-C-6.
[336:35.56]M-G-B-4-C-6-T-W-G.
[336:43.45]There we go.
[336:43.97]Okay.
[336:45.87]Bob-omb Mansion.
[336:46.79]Short and sweet.
[336:47.41]This one is pretty explosive.
[336:51.24]Alright.
[336:58.46]Let's take a look First day of work and I dropped the vase on the ground Alright, well, okay I'm just gonna get over that
[337:28.21]Do I need to do something with these?
[337:29.19]I feel like you wouldn't have bombs if I wasn't gonna need to use them.
[337:45.14]I can't fucking believe I missed that jump.
[338:00.77]That's one way to do it.
[338:09.88]Wait.
[338:11.06]Ah!
[338:29.59]Oh, yeah!
[338:30.65]I didn't see the other one.
[338:36.55]No!
[338:37.27]Ah!
[338:42.68]The chopped it.
[338:44.14]I didn't see it.
[338:44.68]It's good.
[338:47.42]This is a pretty good placement of the Bob-ombs, I will say.
[338:50.70]They kind of just barely get right in the way.
[338:57.13]Pretty good.
[339:04.32]Almost fuckin' blew that one.
[339:09.08]Alright, oh, that's dead!
[339:13.34]Upside down P. Hit it?
[339:35.24]I knew I was gonna need this.
[339:38.63]Y'all thought I wasn't gonna need that, and I got it.
[339:42.71]Now I got Yoshi.
[339:43.37]What do I do with Yoshi now?
[339:44.87]Uh... Nothing else?
[340:10.93]Alright, hold on here.
[340:15.34]Checkpoint, nice.
[340:22.74]I do have to say, I don't want to lose Yoshi, though, because I'm not going to get him at the checkpoint.
[340:32.04]Uh, I was off-screen, so... It's alright, I got an extra- I get to take an extra hit.
[340:42.23]Let me see what this looks like.
[340:43.15]Hold on.
[340:45.70]Shit.
[340:46.08]Go.
[340:46.30]Damage boost.

[341:30.25]The level, the movie.
[341:36.59]KMG.
[341:44.60]Mario goes to the store for milk.
[341:52.12]Alright.
[341:57.08]Uh, sorry, a Zeppelin just flew by.
[341:59.68]Alright, uh, go to the store and get the milk.
[342:06.26]Reach the goal after defeating all the booms.
[342:21.62]What the absolute fuck is that?
[342:32.19]Oh, that's not good.
[342:53.84]How do I break the ice?
[342:59.20]Let's go!
[343:09.78]We're going real fast.
[343:19.91]Can you actually crash the car and die?
[343:43.31]What else you got let's go This level made me cry tears of joy, I'll check it out.
[343:53.57]Thank you for the level by the way
[344:11.01]Escape from pierthorn perch.
[344:12.75]Can you escape the tricky jungle of spiky pierthorn trees water is rising?
[344:17.99]Okay Let's go dragon, uh Remember we're talking about how like, uh, did I say something earlier about like a pizza?
[344:36.94]I said earlier that I was gonna eat like a large pizza or something, didn't I?
[344:46.94]Oh, I thought... Um... Do you guys have to get all the coins?
[344:53.68]Oh, there we go.
[345:20.58]I'm not going to make this.
[345:23.28]I didn't even try.
[345:31.04]I'm not going to eat a McChicken on stream again.
[345:32.76]That's not going to be the thing.
[345:44.03]Is the audio a bit early?
[345:46.01]Yeah, I don't know why.
[345:47.21]Especially the
[345:49.27]The switch, for some reason, when I pull through this capture card, goes out of sync.
[345:53.39]I think it happens sometimes with other ones, too, but not... I feel like it's a switch thing.
[345:59.53]At least for my... whatever I have for a setup here.
[346:11.17]No!
[346:15.84]Any other compulsive jumpers in Mario?
[346:18.77]Like, I jump, I'll land on a surface, jump!
[346:21.21]Okay.
[346:22.41]I'm a compulsive jumper.
[346:31.82]I need to hit a blue switch somewhere.
[346:33.54]Looks like it's over here.
[346:37.30]There it is.
[346:51.75]Was gonna shoot out of there.
[346:54.87]Shell, but why do I need a shell?
[346:58.04]I guess I could go like this.
[347:03.32]Anybody else here an idiot too?
[347:04.70]No, just me?
[347:05.50]Get out of here.
[347:06.18]Give me a break.
[347:06.90]Get out of here.
[347:09.77]Get out of here with that shit.
[347:10.91]Come on.
[347:12.33]Get out of here.
[347:13.99]Like, come on.
[347:14.57]Really?
[347:15.49]Really?
[347:22.50]I'm gonna- I want to kill this because I don't know what's in that box.
[347:59.72]What was the point of that?
[348:02.16]Um... To get back up there quickly, I guess?
[348:06.05]To hit the switch?
[348:07.09]Really?
[348:07.69]Why did you turn so rapidly?
[348:18.51]Did I pick... I got that one already.
[348:21.09]That's odd.
[348:22.41]Okay.
[348:23.13]Okay.
[348:32.27]Oh, might as well get it.
[348:34.87]Three more?
[348:36.23]There's one in there.
[348:37.61]Uh... Um... Blow it up?
[348:38.47]Blow that up?
[349:04.03]Oh shit!
[349:05.89]I'm fine.
[349:09.13]Oh no, now they can't get down here!
[349:11.79]What have I done?
[349:19.27]Well, they're in a nice place.
[349:20.21]Was I supposed to do that?
[349:33.68]Switches over here.
[349:34.42]I think now I can do this.
[349:36.18]No.
[349:36.36]I have to go... It's got to bounce off that.
[349:39.02]Did I screw the whole thing up?
[350:08.70]You would think it would bounce across, right?
[350:10.20]I... I guess I'm just gonna stand down there.
[350:16.26]Alright.
[350:16.86]Alright, do it again.
[350:40.19]Uh, what does that achieve for me?
[350:42.39]What did I just do?
[350:43.93]Can I jump up here?
[350:44.79]Oh, I can go through this wood.
[350:52.77]Right, alright.
[350:54.03]Then, hold on, anything change up here?
[351:14.88]There we go.
[351:15.68]Alright, two more.
[351:16.44]I'm thinking, I'm thinking jump and grab and fall and grab and hold and... Okay.
[351:21.58]Do I need to blow that up with a bomb?
[351:45.54]Can I swim?
[351:46.98]Or am I going to sink right to the bottom?
[351:53.57]I don't remember.
[351:54.01]Okay, sometimes I forget.
[351:55.59]Alright.
[351:55.95]What was on this side?
[352:14.93]Okay, there's this shit.
[352:19.85]So that wall is gone.
[352:20.81]What are you gonna fire?
[352:26.22]Oh, it's a homing missile.
[352:27.22]Oh, fuck!
[352:27.64]I'm fine.
[352:28.16]Alright, one more.
[352:29.66]And where is this last one?
[352:44.01]What's down here?
[352:44.59]Can I see anything?
[352:45.35]Alright, what is this?
[352:46.63]It's not.
[352:48.65]Alright, just swim.
[352:50.80]Just swim.
[352:51.18]Just swim.
[352:51.52]Swim, swim, swim, swim, swim, swim.
[352:53.70]There's one more somewhere.
[352:56.04]Where's this last one?
[353:12.98]Red platform rider.
[353:15.16]What is this?
[353:17.14]Go in?
[353:17.98]What's it gonna drop?
[353:21.48]A bomb!
[353:23.16]But what do I do with the bomb?
[353:25.55]I don't have the key!
[353:46.53]Left, left, go left.
[353:49.95]Alright, then I gotta... Alright, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[353:54.61]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[353:55.11]I gotta, okay.
[353:55.99]I gotta go down.
[353:58.05]Take a bomb down.
[353:59.27]But right down?
[354:00.03]Straight down?
[354:00.51]This is it.
[354:05.34]Holy shit, it's already open!
[354:07.32]I did it already.
[354:07.98]Nice.
[354:12.96]Now, I gotta... A power block...
[354:16.68]And I need to do something with this.
[354:20.41]What do I need to do with this?
[354:22.13]What do I do with this?
[354:22.87]I don't know what this wants me to do.
[354:24.95]Um, do I kill it?
[354:26.53]Go in the pipe?
[354:35.93]Okay.
[354:46.49]There's another... Holy shit, this is long.
[354:54.57]Oh, that's not good.
[354:55.19]I had to bounce and then grab.
[354:58.13]Oh, boy.
[354:58.55]Okay, so I gotta... Now it became a speed run.
[355:05.19]Okay.
[355:13.76]Why didn't I throw that earlier?
[355:15.82]That's what I want to know.
[355:28.46]Okay.
[355:30.80]Now what?
[355:31.98]Oh!
[355:33.02]Spin.
[355:33.36]I can just throw it anywhere though, so that's fine.
[355:45.40]Did it go in the water?
[355:53.14]This whole stream, I'll tell you.
[355:55.74]Take all the audio clips I've said.
[355:59.52]I might as well be watching golf.
[356:02.76]Oh!
[356:05.52]Did it go in the water?
[356:07.24]Oh, it got trapped.
[356:09.53]I'm just watching fucking golf.
[356:22.65]Really?
[356:22.93]Come on, that's bullshit.
[356:29.80]I bounced off one and hit the other.
[356:33.24]Is it culprit?
[356:35.18]I'm safe.
[356:57.16]Wait a minute, what's with the other keys?
[357:01.68]There's just no other keys?
[357:06.79]Whatever.
[357:11.37]That was good.
[357:15.41]Watching golf with the occasional jump scare reaction.
[357:21.04]Yeah, that's when the guy accidentally hits it, like, way too far.
[357:25.57]And it, like, soars.
[357:26.51]That's when the guy uses, like, a 3-wood instead of a pitching wedge, and he, like, hits it, like, fuckin' over the building.
[357:51.10]Haha, yeah, totally.
[358:03.71]No slack at all tonight, huh?
[358:06.61]Jeez.
[358:07.03]Alright, let's do... What about the times when I yell?
[358:19.10]I'm trying to fuck the guy up that's hitting the ball.
[358:22.45]Right when he goes down, I go like... And I get fucking thrown out.
[358:29.75]Alright.
[358:31.71]Epic cool level.
[358:32.75]Okay, let's try this one.
[358:41.64]D, what is it?
[358:42.84]D2, G, W8, 4.
[358:43.66]What is it?
[358:53.23]I missed out.
[358:53.75]No, no, no.
[358:55.55]50H.
[358:56.33]What the hell is this?
[359:08.86]Did I just, like, type in somebody's fucking, like, password?
[359:11.94]Did I just, like, get into somebody's account?
[359:15.25]Was that, like, your account login?
[359:16.57]Okay.
[359:29.91]I made this for you.
[359:30.75]Alright, we'll do this one.
[359:38.59]Why does this one look familiar?
[359:48.69]Did I do this one already?
[359:51.10]What is that?
[359:53.70]Of course it looks familiar.
[359:54.58]It's dyed to Pinwheel.
[359:55.72]Okay.
[360:24.13]Alright, let... Your skills astound me.
[360:29.26]Here we go.
[360:29.68]This one looks normal.
[360:33.06]This one looks normal and not like this.
[360:34.80]Okay.
[360:34.94]Alright, try this level.
[360:55.50]I feel like that one would be fun.
[361:03.23]I feel like 30 or 40 of those were just those.
[361:05.23]Alright, let's do this one.
[361:12.87]This one looks normal.
[361:14.39]I think this is a normal one.
[361:32.43]Boing gear tower.
[361:33.66]Alright.
[361:33.96]This one is real and it's also apparently very hard solve and scale the highest tower I'll try I'm sorry.
[361:55.42]I had to stop.
[361:55.98]Alright, where are we going?
[361:57.06]Uh scale the tower
[362:04.65]I mean, I obviously had to do that.
[362:06.33]This looks complicated.
[362:07.13]I might just veto this one.
[362:08.65]How do I...
[362:37.08]I'll try this one more time.
[362:43.90]Damage run it, maybe?
[362:44.80]Or does it matter which one of these I go into?
[362:46.59]Probably not.
[363:09.04]I'm assuming I probably have to damage run this.
[363:10.68]Let's go.
[363:12.02]I'm missing something.
[363:21.30]This one is different.
[363:32.40]Alright, hold on here.
[363:39.43]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[363:43.35]Holy, that went way too fast.
[363:47.94]Come on.
[363:49.34]Holy fuck.
[363:57.39]Oh shit, look out, it's Zeppelin!
[364:19.47]I think I got it.
[364:20.57]And then the thing shoots?
[364:23.21]Ah!
[364:23.73]It's just a P. It's just a P block.
[364:25.93]It's not a big deal.
[364:28.33]Now that'll give me the... I have this now.
[364:33.01]Should I take them both?
[364:34.71]I can't take them both.
[364:35.79]Alright, now... Now I can... Go... Uh... Into this one?
[364:54.12]I don't think it's this one.
[364:55.02]Throw the spring over here?
[364:56.10]Oh, what happened?
[364:57.66]What happened?
[364:58.22]Did I do it?
[365:17.43]Oh, okay.
[365:17.85]I gotta get them all.
[365:18.87]Alright.
[365:19.21]No, no, no.
[365:19.49]Alright, so that's that one.
[365:20.37]Now we gotta do this one.
[365:24.86]So now... Oh, alright.
[365:26.18]Okay.
[365:26.52]Uh... Um, no.
[365:27.30]Can I grab this?
[365:38.28]Can...
[365:50.73]Is that thing gonna kill me?
[365:56.09]How do I get this down there?
[366:27.05]Um, so that means should I kill the... What if I go like this and then... No, that wasn't what I just did.
[366:40.38]I need to throw the bomb.
[366:55.98]I have to keep pushing the thwomp.
[366:57.30]Yeah, but, I mean, how do I do that?
[366:59.68]I always think I can throw a bomb down there.
[367:01.14]Let me look at this again.
[367:02.30]Okay.
[367:02.56]Are you serious?
[367:04.52]That...
[367:32.90]Do it again.
[367:37.08]Only two more.
[367:39.48]If I die, it's over.
[367:45.53]Now, this is the one that I was in... Alright, I have no idea how to do this one.
[367:50.59]Get up here.
[367:52.92]And then... Somehow, I have to hit this.
[368:08.46]But how do I grab that?
[368:09.56]Because I can't jump through.
[368:14.31]Will he hit this?
[368:15.85]Hold on.
[368:16.19]I felt like that was pretty good.
[368:55.81]Okay, uh, so now this is where I can die.
[368:59.03]This is bad.
[368:59.79]Because I don't have any checkpoints.
[369:02.23]Is this it?
[369:02.99]It's this or that's it?
[369:04.88]It's over.
[369:05.24]So I have to go down, pull it up, go down, and then... I don't know.
[369:11.46]I have no idea how the fuck to get over there.
[369:15.39]I get one shot.
[369:17.15]Climb up, climb down...
[369:47.30]What?
[369:47.52]Did that really just happen?
[369:54.29]I was... Hold on.
[369:58.87]I need to see that again.
[369:59.83]That was dog shit.
[370:02.39]That... Come on.
[370:03.47]That was not cool.
[370:04.51]What?
[370:05.28]I'm actually... I'm pretty mad about that.
[370:18.39]Apparently.
[370:18.87]I have to stand on that.
[370:23.75]Yeah, I have to get on and stand on it.
[370:25.53]Well, I'm gonna do this one first.
[370:26.71]The other ones aren't that hard.
[370:28.37]I'm gonna do it.
[370:42.60]But then when it comes back, what am I supposed to do?
[370:52.34]Like here.
[370:53.62]You gotta go up, you gotta go down.
[370:55.86]When it goes up, you gotta go up.
[370:56.76]When it goes down, you gotta go down.
[371:08.93]You gotta fit yourself in the slot, whatever one it's currently on.
[371:19.99]I'm trying to scope fast.
[371:21.39]No, I shouldn't be doing that.
[371:25.38]Hasty, hasty, hasty.
[371:50.19]What the fuck?
[371:51.65]I wanted to stay on it!
[371:56.29]No!
[371:57.41]Oh, it's killing me.
[371:58.71]I have to do this.
[371:59.57]You get this little tiny margin.
[372:06.06]Damn it.
[372:07.06]Damn it.
[372:07.64]It's... Look at how far away I am.
[372:14.72]What is with that?
[372:15.90]I'm not even close.
[372:39.49]Alright, let's go.
[372:43.73]The yellow ones are not that hard.
[372:45.61]I should be able to do them without a problem.
[372:51.37]Okay.
[372:54.11]What is this one?
[372:55.45]I haven't seen this one yet either.
[372:58.27]Might as well figure out how to do them all.
[373:03.84]Alright.
[373:06.04]So the theory here is...
[373:11.20]To get this down, I have to throw it?
[373:13.52]Just throw it down there and then... What, do I jump down with this and then throw it over?
[373:21.52]How am I supposed to get to the right?
[373:34.78]So then now I can just... No, but how?
[373:36.95]I gotta go backwards to the blocks.
[373:52.85]Done deal.
[373:59.27]Two more!
[374:00.95]Don't accidentally hit the spike.
[374:07.99]This one, I know how to do this one.
[374:11.20]Right?
[374:11.50]I remember, yeah.
[374:12.24]Oh, this one actually, I can die here.
[374:14.10]This one's kind of wonky.
[374:16.28]I can die here.
[374:32.59]Give me another one.
[374:45.26]No.
[374:46.58]No, that was painful.
[374:47.50]It was.
[374:47.83]That was painful, but I don't want to do it again.
[374:51.17]It was not that bad.
[374:51.89]It was good.
[374:52.27]That level was good.
[374:53.79]I had it, but I don't want to do it again.
[374:56.69]Damn it.
[375:02.10]That one was fun.
[375:12.32]I knew that there was a big push there, and... Let's do this one.
[375:22.37]What time is it?
[375:22.81]Alright, we'll do a few more in the night.
[375:25.46]We gotta call it.
[375:26.82]It's getting late.
[375:27.34]0GD...
[375:34.26]I will be back tomorrow with... That's a good question.
[375:43.16]Something.
[375:45.30]Meowsers for challenges.
[375:46.95]Complete each diverse challenge and race Meowser to the finish.
[376:06.10]Nice.
[376:17.85]Isn't tomorrow Terraria Day?
[376:19.31]Um... Ah, I'm gonna have to talk to Star.
[376:21.89]It was supposed to be either tomorrow or Saturday or Saturday or... Depending on what he was doing.
[376:30.40]Maybe it's tomorrow.
[376:31.52]If he's around tomorrow and wants to do it tomorrow, we'll do it tomorrow.
[376:40.82]uh alright let's go over here there's got to be a reason for this of course there is this is cheating now
[377:13.04]He wants to watch Evo.
[377:14.10]Oh, fuck!
[377:14.92]Evo is this weekend.
[377:17.30]Oh, no.
[377:18.52]I got too much stuff to do.
[377:19.82]Oh, no.
[377:22.18]I wanted to go.
[377:23.06]It's, like, right here.
[377:29.26]I gotta get on a plane and, like, go to this robotics facility.
[377:33.20]Evo is this weekend.
[377:34.42]Why is there so much stuff going on?
[377:47.10]Go!
[377:50.36]Did I just get trolled?
[377:54.24]Was that like a joke?
[377:57.92]What?
[377:58.06]What?
[377:58.22]I'm... What happened?
[378:03.00]Oh, that was one of the trials.
[378:04.20]I was supposed to go back up.
[378:29.34]Uh, when does Evo- BWAH!
[378:31.22]Those are ice cubes!
[378:45.13]I'm dead.
[378:48.37]Starts at 10 a.m.
[378:49.29]tomorrow.
[378:49.81]Well, no, I- I- no, I got- I- I'm not gonna go.
[378:52.45]I got too much going on.
[379:13.12]It's all weekend?
[379:14.78]Yeah, but I... I can't.
[379:16.73]Because I'm streaming.
[379:21.49]I'm going to be streaming today, tomorrow, and the next day.
[379:25.81]I might be able to pop over there on Sunday.
[379:28.71]But then next week, I'm going to go.
[379:31.43]I'm going to... I'm going across the country.
[379:34.84]To work on the carnival stream at the facility where it's happening.
[379:38.72]So, I don't... Wait, give me the fly.
[379:40.02]Give me the fly.
[379:42.77]I'm not just gonna not scream.
[379:47.01]Maybe I'll just go watch the finals.
[379:51.77]That's a whole separate event, right?
[379:53.39]The finals.
[380:12.83]Should I stay in the car?
[380:13.53]I don't know why I'm still in the car.
[380:19.10]Depends on what game.
[380:29.63]I do need the car.
[380:30.37]Am I too small to get in there now?
[380:38.95]Oh, thank god.
[380:44.33]Alright, back out.
[380:47.35]Evo sold out.
[380:48.87]Oh, well, there you go.
[380:50.07]Never mind.
[380:56.67]Scream the finals on your channel like you did with E3.
[380:58.77]I don't... I'm not sure you were allowed to co-scream that.
[381:03.52]And plus, I don't have any idea what the hell I'm talking about.
[381:07.10]I would not be able to commentate, like, Street Fighter gameplay.
[381:24.78]Okay, just let him fall down there and just do it.
[381:29.11]I need that.
[382:02.65]Alright, two more.
[382:06.97]Easy.
[382:09.83]What?
[382:10.41]No!
[382:10.93]He was a different... He was a different... I didn't... I thought... I thought he took a long time to shoot that.
[382:24.76]He took his time to shoot that.
[382:27.68]Fuck, that one was fun too.
[382:34.63]Tina Belcher?
[382:52.80]Alright, it's almost time to go.
[382:53.84]Fuck.
[382:58.32]I feel like I did that a lot today too.
[383:00.25]Alright, let's do
[383:02.85]This one's a relaxing level.
[383:04.43]Who knows if they're alive or not.
[383:09.31]WPT.
[383:16.09]YJ5.
[383:19.75]LKG.
[383:27.07]Seven Heaven.
[383:28.33]Traverse Bowser Jr's fleet.
[383:30.19]Watch out for the cannonballs.
[383:42.98]Is this Cake Mario?
[383:43.90]No.
[383:45.02]This is not Cake Mario.
[383:47.88]It's not my favorite Mario.
[383:50.72]It got big, it got small.
[383:55.49]I don't need it.
[383:57.33]I don't need it for these auto-scrollers.
[384:04.72]Fire, watch out for the fire.
[384:23.43]Got it.
[384:24.37]This is it.
[384:24.75]What a nice level.
[384:26.40]Kind of relaxing and just fun.
[384:28.88]Just jump around and jump on stuff.
[384:30.54]Watch out for the fire.
[384:32.78]Get the Goombas.
[384:41.04]I thought there was a ground.
[384:50.83]Where are you going?
[384:51.75]Uhhh...
[384:58.62]Guys.
[385:03.34]Guys, I- I can't.
[385:05.18]It might be time for me to, uh, pull the plug.
[385:10.91]I don't- I don't know what it is.
[385:12.17]Mario is such, like, a fun family game.
[385:15.57]But when I play it, I feel like I smoked a pack of cigarettes.
[385:30.10]Thank you.
[386:03.37]Now we try to get a good jump.
[386:04.95]That was a 4 out of 10.
[386:18.63]What time is it?
[386:19.37]We can do two more.
[386:20.67]Two more.
[386:23.49]Six and a half hours.
[386:24.17]We're good.
[386:25.57]We can do like two more.
[386:28.75]Somebody said there's a baby level.
[386:32.56]Wait, hold on.
[386:32.90]There's a cool level with wrenches.
[386:34.02]Let me do this one first.
[386:37.79]He's addicted?
[386:38.45]Well, it's kind of just fun to see what people make.
[386:43.37]This one has wrenches.
[386:59.39]Escaping the P-Mole Fortress.
[387:02.41]Use their P-Block against them.
[387:05.07]Okay.
[387:17.10]Use the P-Block against them, and it's also got this lava here.
[387:23.10]That deer right there has wrenches in this level.
[387:25.79]It means it gets an automatic one point letter grade higher.
[387:28.45]I can't even make this jump.
[387:29.33]I have to stop looking at fucking chat.
[387:58.95]Oh, you guys.
[387:59.79]What the fuck?
[388:08.70]Alright, let's go.
[388:09.32]Am I- Am I still here?
[388:17.42]You still alive, man?
[388:18.36]You still with me?
[388:18.94]Am I- Am I gonna- Am I gonna think that smell thing that people put in your nose and makes you go, I'm alive now.
[388:39.21]It's all about these blocks!
[388:41.95]The car is leaving without me.
[388:43.11]They're going on vacation without me.
[388:44.21]I don't even have my fucking backpack.
[388:46.07]That's unbelievable.
[388:50.47]What happens if they go all the way?
[388:51.39]Oh.
[389:02.53]Hey, everybody figure this out!
[389:30.74]Look at all those.
[389:31.96]Look at all those fucking ribbons, whatever they are.
[389:40.56]Holy shit.
[389:41.84]How am I supposed to do that?
[389:46.14]Oh, man.
[389:47.24]No.
[389:48.49]Come back.
[389:49.77]Come back!
[389:50.61]Where's the switch?
[389:53.07]Oh, I have to hit the switch right...
[390:00.10]Holy shit.
[390:07.89]I have to just dodge until it gets all the way over there.
[390:09.71]I have to tap it and wait.
[390:12.05]I have to wait for one pass of ribbons.
[390:22.69]Right here, don't go anywhere.
[390:25.26]Touch it, and I have to wait.
[390:29.37]That was impossible.
[390:32.01]That was an uncompletable, uh... That was an uncompletable bowtie posture right there.
[390:37.61]I'm sorry.
[390:38.31]Where was I supposed to go?
[390:39.41]Alright, come on!
[390:54.55]One more pass and that's it.
[390:56.13]Oh shit!
[391:05.39]I need that.
[391:10.38]That's fire!
[391:11.00]Gimme that!
[391:21.49]Just damage boost!
[391:24.91]Oh, I fucking panicked!
[391:26.45]God, I'm so pissed.
[391:31.32]It's alright, I'm right here.
[391:40.53]Oh, I'm pissed.
[391:42.33]Pissed.
[391:44.23]He's... Dude, you hear that?
[391:45.14]He's pissed.
[391:51.64]Give me the... Give me... Mushroom, come on.
[391:59.36]Get a mushroom out here right now.
[392:00.77]Please.
[392:15.76]Oh, this... Fire.
[392:19.78]Right.
[392:22.52]Oh my goodness.
[392:46.02]I gotta, like, bait them up.
[392:53.89]Alright, get this mushroom and then relax.
[392:55.91]Now wait, they throw two.
[392:59.71]There it is.
[393:01.23]Wait for the fire.
[393:03.19]You gotta be kidding me.
[393:04.55]Get the other mushroom right now.
[393:06.17]Right now!
[393:06.89]Why did it not come out?
[393:08.15]Why did that not come out?
[393:09.21]I don't understand.
[393:35.17]Alright.
[393:36.56]The fire is what's killing me here.
[393:37.76]I've got plenty of time, so just hold on.
[393:46.74]Can't go.
[393:47.14]That guy just tried to snipe me.
[394:00.78]I tried to jump off of them, and for some reason holding B just didn't do anything.
[394:08.72]I was holding the B button down.
[394:11.02]Come on!
[394:49.21]I don't know.
[394:50.81]They're gonna be everywhere now.
[394:53.10]I'm in so much trouble.
[394:54.92]Look at this.
[394:55.46]They're everywhere.
[394:58.02]Look at this.
[395:00.10]Did you see this?
[395:00.86]I... I have to just go fast.
[395:10.31]You gotta go as fast as you can, otherwise they just group up on you.
[395:12.85]I'm not that fast.
[395:26.07]There's no, like, power button or something somewhere?
[395:28.61]I almost got hit by that.
[395:41.48]Alright, let me take a second before I just... We have to go fast because the... Oh, you motherfucker.
[395:52.09]Wait, just get... I was gonna wait for the mushroom.
[395:55.03]You have to... I have to stand... I'm gonna stand on the edge after the fire.
[395:59.49]There's one square you can stand on.
[396:03.45]My stomach just hit the, uh... By the way, if you're curious, my stomach just fucking pushed forward on the desk and hit R. I didn't think it was on...
[396:29.29]They're in such a bad spot.
[396:31.35]No, what the fuck?
[396:35.24]Oh my god.
[396:39.16]Oh my- What the fuck?!
[396:41.86]Throw them up, yeah.
[396:44.26]Up here.
[396:58.95]Throw them.
[396:59.29]I know you... Mmm.
[397:00.73]This fire over here is... Give me the mushroom.
[397:05.36]And now, let me get up here.
[397:07.40]Oh, please.
[397:19.57]Alright.
[397:20.15]Hold on right here for a second.
[397:23.03]It's gonna hit me!
[397:44.65]Wow!
[397:51.51]Oh, thank God.
[397:52.45]Huh?
[398:10.62]You gotta kill... Okay, kill him.
[398:12.06]I killed him.
[398:12.70]No, we just have...
[398:19.01]I think I have to get down there now.
[398:20.05]I did it.
[398:24.71]That one was intense.
[398:29.61]That last spot... That last screen with the vines and the wrenches and the explosions and the... I don't know if I can do that one again.
[398:40.50]That was really cool though.
[398:45.22]Alright.
[398:47.26]We're gonna end it on one more.
[398:49.55]Give me like a Game of Thrones theme song.
[399:09.36]You can search?
[399:10.56]Let me search then.
[399:17.42]No, I don't want to... It's not over, it's not over, it's not over, it's not over.
[399:25.20]How am I searching?
[399:27.62]Difficulty all.

[412:41.81]That's it?
[412:42.17]What was that?
[412:52.29]I grew up on that meme.
[412:54.41]I think a lot of people did.
[412:57.32]That was back when YouTube... People would just sentence splice together a bunch of dog shit.
[413:06.26]There were whole communities around just like YouTube poops.
[413:11.87]That was old.
[413:12.37]Alright, we'll do... Donkey Kong.
[413:18.90]That's it.
[413:24.60]It was an interesting time.
[413:25.42]Yeah, you never knew what you were going to get.
[413:31.21]Kong?
[413:37.48]Donkey Kong.

[415:04.16]Whoa!
[415:04.40]That's not in Mario!
[415:05.36]That's not in Donkey Kong!
[415:09.00]They don't fire laser beams at you from the cannons?
[415:26.93]They added that in.
[415:28.63]This is an interpretation of what that was.
[415:30.51]Alright, well, hold on a second here.
[415:37.52]Now...

[420:00.01]They really won't ever.
[420:12.71]Stop trying to act cool.
[420:16.11]What?

[420:48.03]Where's it gonna take me?
[420:49.45]Get on there.
[421:16.55]That was really cute.
[421:21.21]Ah.
[421:22.35]Feels definitely pretty nice.
[421:26.90]Wait.
[421:28.98]Batter up, swipe the incoming shells.
[421:32.68]I know the stream's over, but hold on.
[421:38.02]And it's Cake Mario, so that's already a +2 letter grades.
[422:02.40]Home run.
[422:07.90]Oh, this is it.
[422:11.38]You guys don't even think I fucking know what I'm doing.
[422:14.97]Shit!
[422:32.81]I need another one!
[422:34.07]Give me another ball!
[422:35.88]Where are they?
[422:36.30]Down here?
[422:36.64]Oh, no.
[422:38.78]Nah, do that again.
[422:41.92]I wanna do that again.

[423:13.19]alright this one's fast no the next one is it's this one that's just like boom got it oh that was a curveball
[423:53.60]I think the tail is a cape?
[423:58.67]No, I'm saying cake.
[424:00.57]C-A-K-E.
[424:01.75]Like Cake Mario.
[424:02.81]Not Cape Mario.
[424:07.31]Let's see.
[424:07.87]De-stress land.
[424:14.97]Cake Mario again.
[424:17.73]Back to back.
[424:31.25]Why do I call it Cake Mario?
[424:35.93]Do I have to actually explain this?
[424:41.01]Back in like 1997, when you went to the grocery store to buy a birthday cake, this is exactly what was in the display.
[424:51.75]This outline, the thick, it looked like this.
[424:59.64]This is a grocery store Mario cake from, like, 1996.
[425:05.68]I guess I had to explain that, alright.
[425:14.34]That felt good.
[425:23.07]And plus, he looks like the cake version.
[425:25.11]He looks like a cake.
[425:30.24]There's nothing I can say.
[425:41.11]This is Cake Mario, that's all you need to know.
[425:53.20]Shoo!
[426:08.16]Oh, why did it stop?
[426:09.22]No!
[426:20.10]Nice.
[426:23.99]Stress free.
[426:29.49]Happy.
[426:47.28]It's called Hardcore Jumps, and that is it.
[426:50.10]This will take us... This already is seven hours, never mind.
[426:54.39]That's a back-to-back-to-back.
[426:56.33]That's my favorite Mario.
[427:00.65]I mean, he has... There are other names for this Mario.
[427:03.43]There's Keychain Mario.
[427:04.85]This is also Keychain Mario.
[427:06.76]In fact, I would say that the small Mario is Keychain Mario.
[427:11.66]And the big one is Cake Mario.
[427:14.68]It's for this style.
[427:33.22]At least five people know what I'm talking about.
[427:36.94]That was fun.
[427:38.62]Speedrun 10 seconds, I'll try it.
[427:45.32]Not Cake Mario!
[428:01.53]Okay, I have to open doors and shit.
[428:03.05]I'm gonna die.
[428:05.49]I think I'm dead.
[428:13.92]Yeah.
[428:15.82]Open doors, hit the switch.
[428:17.14]I can do it.
[428:19.16]Just kill me.
[428:37.95]Alright, jump.
[428:48.06]And then down, down, down, down, down, down, down.
[429:00.48]Oh, that was close.
[429:01.44]I didn't do the spring.

[431:15.91]Well, I know where the teehee comes from.
[431:27.87]Pretty clean.
[431:47.89]Is it tied?
[431:49.03]I'm tied for world record.
[431:58.33]I'm sure everybody is.
[431:59.13]Alright, I want... Okay, speedrun.
[432:04.99]Here we go.
[432:05.63]Showstopper.
[432:14.72]You held right at the start like the world record holder.
[432:19.16]Yeah, but...
[432:37.01]Ooh, that was cheeky.
[432:38.75]Alright.
[433:02.67]What do we got?
[433:20.47]Short and sweet.
[433:21.21]Puzzle solving.
[433:23.49]Solving.
[433:25.73]20 second snow run?
[433:31.45]Dan, we're not going to go much longer.
[433:32.94]Don't worry.
[433:33.98]Get 120 coins.
[433:59.78]What?
[434:00.04]Oh, I went over the f- ugh.
[434:06.94]Oh, that sucks.
[434:07.74]Hold on.
[434:20.33]What are you talking about?
[434:21.43]Wait, I- what- I can't even- I'm not gonna read that, but everyone in the chat that can read what you just wrote, what are you talking about?
[434:37.96]It's fucking gross.
[434:39.32]I don't even know what you mean by that.
[434:44.60]What's wrong with you guys?
[434:49.72]Why are you writing that?
[435:03.41]Ooh.
[435:05.09]Hmm.
[435:10.09]I like these... Okay, this is only 8% completion, though.
[435:14.01]Why?
[435:15.41]That seems pretty low.
[435:20.27]Have you done Bowser's big...
[435:39.27]I have not done that.
[435:40.33]I have not done Bowser's big burrito.
[435:45.07]Oooooh, stupid.
[436:02.75]Bowser's big bean burrito?
[436:22.37]Alright, get- what is it?
[436:30.84]What is it?
[436:31.72]I'll do it after this.
[436:50.03]What's about Bowser's burrito?
[437:01.48]Is it me?
[437:02.06]That's me!
[437:02.90]No, it's not.
[437:03.30]It's another fucking guy with a frog hat on.
[437:04.72]Alright, what is it?
[437:22.65]8VS3... Okay, no one.
[437:27.38]8VS3.
[437:30.86]W0?
[437:35.34]7VF.
[437:40.92]Bowser's Big Bean Burrito.
[437:45.36]What the fuck is this?
[438:07.61]I just wiped out the floor.
[438:08.76]I think there's gonna be a P block for that.
[438:11.34]What?
[438:11.94]Oh.
[438:13.58]I don't... I don't understand.
[438:38.54]What are you supposed to do about that ending?
[438:41.66]Let's be real here.
[438:43.36]What is that?
[438:49.06]Wait, it goes... I thought maybe I could... What?
[439:05.17]I pressed the button twice!
[439:32.37]Why did you want me to play that?
[439:38.28]Oh, did Dunkey make this?
[440:06.17]No, no, okay.
[440:06.75]Okay.
[440:08.25]I played it.
[440:08.81]Okay Alright Do one one with a twist, alright, I'll do that one too and then we're going about
[440:35.65]One TW.
[440:41.96]LLB?
[440:42.38]Uh, one SF.
[440:47.92]Alright, this is it.
[440:48.56]This is truly the last one.
[440:51.81]This is called Woof 1-1 Slip and Slide.
[440:56.37]Sliding is key for speed.
[440:57.43]Can you find all three bonus super coins?
[441:03.89]This is not the right one.
[441:05.66]Well, I'll try this one anyways.
[441:40.48]Oh shit, I wasn't supposed to even do this one
[442:19.55]Do the real one?
[442:20.27]I will.
[442:21.97]But I'm already through one one woof.
[442:25.65]I'm almost halfway there.
[442:32.97]Shit, thought I had it.
[442:39.04]Oh, that's a shitty jump.
[442:47.73]Is there a mushroom in any of these?
[443:00.02]The audio fucked up?
[443:02.74]Yeah, it sometimes happens after a while.
[443:05.84]I'm sorry.
[443:09.81]Oops.
[443:17.42]It's been off for a long time.
[443:18.58]So the audio is early.
[443:20.58]The game audio is early?
[443:21.61]Hold on.
[443:23.49]What?
[443:28.81]That's weird.
[443:30.96]I already have it set to 100 milliseconds to offset it.
[443:34.40]I have to do it again.
[443:49.19]That's weird.
[443:50.77]I don't know why it does that.
[443:54.01]Oh shit, that's bad.
[443:58.45]Okay, well I found the dev thing.
[444:00.32]No, I didn't.
[444:06.20]Alright, that's fine.
[444:26.39]Not enough momentum.
[444:27.37]How am I going to fit in there?
[444:28.21]I need to... Oh, I have to try one more time.
[444:32.48]Damn it.
[444:39.56]I'm going to lean back in my chair.
[444:40.58]That's how it's going to work.
[444:42.40]Crouch?
[444:42.70]I was trying to crouch.
[444:43.44]I couldn't do it.
[444:46.79]I was trying.
[444:47.97]I promise I was trying.
[445:16.66]Hurry up That's one way to do it that's how you do it apparently one way I'll say the same thing twice with different ways.
[445:30.41]I said another thing the same way but twice I
[445:37.93]Alright.
[445:39.23]What is the actual one that you guys wanted to see?
[445:48.62]Do you stand or sit when you wipe?
[445:50.26]Neither.
[445:51.52]I lurch down and push my, like, ass down into the toilet and shake in the water.
[445:57.45]And then fucking, like, after, like, 10-20 seconds just lift up and, like, wipe the rest of my, like, cheeks and shit.
[446:02.23]Where's the one?
[446:11.01]Played 100 courses, cool.
[446:14.25]YXL?
[446:20.69]Is that the one?
[446:21.31]I need to see it at least a few times.
[446:32.56]Alright, YXL.
[446:33.78]Hopefully this is the one.
[446:36.76]I think it is.
[446:38.34]D4C...
[446:42.16]T, Q, F.
[446:49.24]1-1, but with a twist.
[446:51.18]Super Mario Bros.
[446:52.06]1-1 with a tiny twist.
[446:52.96]Are you ready for a brand new 1-1 experience?
[446:55.76]And, like, three people have beaten this level.
[446:58.42]In the fucking world.
[446:59.18]0.02%.
[446:59.20]I get a better return.
[447:10.66]on my bank savings account annually than that.
[447:20.52]Just saying.
[447:28.63]No one's going to be... What is it?
[447:30.15]Impossible?
[447:36.97]Yeah.
[447:38.27]It looks like it.
[447:41.40]with a twist.
[447:42.52]Yeah, it's kind of a very obvious twist.
[447:45.96]You just threw up shit everywhere.
[447:47.62]You just made it impossible.
[447:50.73]Well, it's obviously left, right.
[447:58.81]Okay.
[448:00.62]Hold on now.
[448:02.22]Just give me a second.
[448:08.58]Okay, no no no, it's left, run all the way to the right.
[448:11.59]I'm gonna do this by timing only.
[448:13.67]One.
[448:15.67]Yeah, you stay over here for another second.
[448:24.33]I think you have to... Maybe I think I might have to jump up onto that one, onto that base.
[448:44.99]Hold on.
[448:48.45]Yeah, you gotta get up on that base, and then to the right.
[448:52.04]Hold on.
[448:57.84]Yeah, alright, hold on.
[448:59.10]I'm making progress here, very slowly.
[449:07.71]I made progress, I went forward more than I did.
[449:16.41]Holy shit, I almost just fucking got real damn far.
[449:18.85]Alright, now I'm doing it.
[449:19.61]I can skip the jump.
[449:41.86]Gotta get faster than that and you get a straight shot over there.
[449:44.34]I think you have to jump up on top of that Yep, I gotta go faster than that.
[449:52.00]I had it.
[449:52.70]I had progress.
[449:54.04]Come on.
[449:56.11]What's the time on this one like 10 seconds?
[450:00.45]Progress
[450:11.01]I gotta go earlier than that.
[450:16.57]How did I do it that fucking time?
[450:22.04]I was going so fast.
[450:29.00]This is jump over it?
[450:30.22]I think you jump over it.
[450:35.42]Yeah, you have to jump all the way over it.
[450:37.03]Otherwise you get hit by that one.
[450:44.42]No.
[450:45.48]I'm getting caught on it.
[450:53.68]There it was!
[450:54.16]There it was!
[450:54.70]No, that's- I had it right!
[450:56.10]You gotta jump over it, and then you gotta keep running.
[451:02.55]I had it right, you gotta go clean over it.
[451:04.51]And then run.
[451:19.52]That was it, but it's gotta be a little bit of hair later.
[451:21.84]Fuck.
[451:29.36]Later than that too.
[451:38.97]Oh.
[451:40.55]I was almost there.
[451:42.37]I just need to get- look where everyone's dying.
[451:43.87]I have to get like at least past this one part.
[451:50.22]I wonder if you jump up or if you have to just wait.
[451:53.28]I have a better idea.
[451:55.80]Silent.
[451:57.78]Watch this.
[452:24.22]I have to make it all the way over there.
[452:35.47]So we don't hear like the... Ten more tries, and then I'm done.
[453:02.11]Oh wait, they can hear me.
[453:09.59]Usually I can do that and you guys do that.
[453:10.87]The game audio will block it out.
[453:16.51]I can't get this first jump now.
[453:26.60]No, I can't.
[453:27.38]Maybe I should go over?
[453:28.60]No, I have to do it like this.
[453:39.89]um that was it oh I almost went too fast no am I going too late maybe I'm going too late
[454:10.28]I am going too late.
[454:12.24]I gotta jump over that.
[454:13.04]Alright, I gotta jump over that.
[454:15.38]I gotta go way earlier.
[454:21.61]Shit, I got caught on this stupid fucking metal thing.
[454:35.97]Why would anybody sit here and beat this?
[454:50.56]Holy shit.
[454:51.98]Is that safe over here?
[454:54.02]I got a coin.
[455:06.17]Nowhere is safe.
[455:07.65]I feel like that wasn't even there before.
[455:17.89]It's safe.
[455:18.93]No, it's not.
[455:19.94]Oh, you have to... Okay, so you have to wait, run, and then jump to the right.
[455:24.59]No way.
[455:25.75]Is that actually what you're supposed to do?
[455:26.87]Because it's safe in the middle there for a second.
[455:49.73]Yeah, you gotta get right over there and jump up.
[455:53.77]Alright, um... Yeah, I don't care.
[455:57.35]Yeah, I'm done.
[455:58.45]I don't give a shit.
[456:01.53]Who cares?
[456:07.73]Damn it.
[456:09.17]I just want to get to the pipe.
[456:10.87]If I get to the pipe, I win.
[456:12.33]I just want to get to the pipe.
[456:13.20]That's all I care about.
[456:14.24]I don't care about anything else.
[456:14.96]It's the pipe.
[456:17.28]Fuck, I thought I had a time to write...
[456:32.61]Why do we do this to ourselves?
[456:35.17]Should I jump up?
[456:37.07]Hold on.
[456:43.09]Can I... If I go fast enough, can I jump on top of that?
[456:47.63]No.
[456:52.66]I don't... Maybe I can.
[456:53.82]No, I can't.
[456:55.16]Maybe... No, you can't.
[457:00.44]No.
[457:00.88]Alright.
[457:01.58]Three more tries and then I'm going to press the off button on the switch.
[457:05.06]Because I won't leave if I don't.
[457:07.56]One.
[457:11.29]Damn it.
[457:11.63]That was close.
[457:12.75]Oh man.
[457:13.29]You have to go all the way to the right and you have to run back.
[457:19.50]That went uncounted.
[457:20.18]I have to land over here.
[457:21.40]That's one.
[457:27.81]Counts.
[457:29.31]Alright, that's two.
[457:30.99]I've got to get over there and stand there and then run left.
[457:35.84]How did you know I was pointing at the screen?
[457:39.02]Wait, how did you know I was intensely pointing at the screen?
[457:42.94]Alright, that's two.
[457:51.32]Okay, that's three.
[457:51.96]This is it.
[457:56.76]No!
[457:57.56]Just let me get over to the right once.
[458:02.23]That's it.
[458:02.75]I'm done.
[458:03.11]I have to turn the switch off.
[458:07.43]Alright, that's as far as I'm going to go.
[458:08.59]Turn off the switch.
[458:21.42]Okay, I'm good.
[458:22.20]Let's go.
[458:34.24]That's it.
[458:38.91]It's too addicting.
[458:39.87]They make it too addicting.
[458:41.47]You just have to sit there and smash your head against a wall for no freaking... Well, that's it.
[458:54.43]Thanks everybody for watching.
[458:55.32]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[458:56.40]Not sure what we're going to do yet.
[458:59.50]There are plenty of options.
[459:00.88]Figure it out before we start.
[459:02.86]Same time.
[459:07.12]So let's go back.
[459:07.84]Let's do the bits and the subs and everything.
[459:11.38]From earlier.
[459:16.68]Thanks for watching.
[459:17.35]Mario Maker's always a fun time.
[459:19.49]Mario Maker's a rollercoaster of emotions for me.
[459:25.21]I go up and down and up and down and up and down over the course of the whole night.
[459:28.83]But it's always a blast.
[459:32.25]It is.
[459:39.49]So, back earlier, we had... Let's see here.
[459:48.13]We had $5 from Kil'Gannon.
[459:49.74]Thank you, Kil'Gannon.
[459:52.38]I don't have much to give, but I made this level specifically because I wanted you to play it.
[459:56.76]And nobody has beaten it yet.
[459:58.16]Please play it.
[459:58.80]I'm proud of it.
[460:00.46]Did we do that one?
[460:02.46]I think we did this one.
[460:04.11]Does this code is... I think I've seen... I saw this code earlier.
[460:14.22]I just like rage turned off my switch.
[460:25.73]Scamming Mario levels.
[460:30.93]I don't think you played it?
[460:35.38]Well, here.
[460:35.78]Here, you guys take this one and let me know how it is.
[460:44.51]I'm just gonna type it, because apparently I can't copy and paste it.
[460:56.67]I feel like I did this one.
[461:01.21]He beat Bowser's Big Bean Burrito?
[461:02.69]Yeah, I did.
[461:04.97]Sorry I didn't get to your level if I didn't.
[461:07.43]I wasn't doing donations for levels.
[461:10.94]Except for the one time, because the person put a fish in their comment, so...
[461:15.61]I was kind of just pulling them out of chat.
[461:18.58]Thank you for the $5.
[461:19.14]Really appreciate it.
[461:24.16]Thank you to Dork Cube for the $2.50.
[461:26.08]How did you get the carnival stream off the ground this quick?
[461:29.69]But years of the Bluetooth brush, we already went over it.
[461:31.63]But thank you again for the $2.50.
[461:32.75]Appreciate it.
[461:43.19]Thank you to Uncle Joe for the 250.
[461:44.67]Not able to catch the whole stream, but I made a remix for all the zoomers in chat.
[461:53.03]Hold on, let me disconnect this.
[461:58.08]Ow, I just like punched my monitor.
[462:02.52]I just saw the crystal goo shit for like flash.
[462:06.52]Alright, it's fine.
[462:07.52]No, it's not.
[462:07.98]It's broken.
[462:09.90]I actually just broke the monitor.
[462:12.53]I pulled out my headphones and my index finger just bumped it and it, like, broke the edge here.
[462:18.71]Not enough to be noticeable, but enough where I'm gonna look at it and go, I'm an idiot and I hate that.
[462:24.56]It's just a tiny little bit in the corner.
[462:27.32]It's fine.
[462:28.88]It may actually have even been there before, and I just noticed it now.
[462:32.84]Shit.
[462:34.16]No, that was definitely there before.
[462:40.65]Oh, no, I'm even stupider.
[462:42.31]That's part of the desktop background.
[462:44.71]Yeah, that's a star in the sky on the desktop background, I think.
[462:47.71]I'll have to check that out later.
[462:51.66]But here is a remix.
[462:52.74]It's a SoundCloud link.
[462:55.46]I need to be able to hear this, though.
[463:01.88]Let's copy that link.
[463:11.36]I'm gonna turn this down a little since it's not that loud.
[463:14.12]Casio keyboard MIDI to get me ready and pumped up.
[463:18.34]You can't accept me at my worst?
[463:20.20]Obey your
[464:29.76]That's pretty good.
[464:31.72]Here's the link for all of you that want it.
[464:36.18]Uh, thank you for that, Uncle Joe.
[464:41.24]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[464:42.04]And then, uh, Zake gave $250.
[464:51.22]Thank you, Zake.
[464:52.70]This is probably the most wholesome video ever.
[464:54.12]Please watch this with the stream.
[465:02.51]Oh, this is like the... Completely honest here.
[465:06.01]It's so bright out right now because the sun is shining on the snow.
[465:09.38]There's laser beams shooting into my eyes.
[465:11.70]Oh, God.
[465:21.66]You alright, Jeremy?
[465:27.73]Laser beams.
[465:28.87]Laser beams.
[465:29.59]I used to...
[465:31.47]After hanging around with chat for a long time, and other people that weren't from the area, I lost a huge amount of my, like, Boston accent.
[465:45.03]Laser beams!
[465:48.96]It used to be so much heavier.
[465:51.22]It still comes up from time to time.
[465:52.50]It still does.
[465:59.00]I'm not gonna watch this whole video.
[466:02.48]Say room.
[466:03.38]Room.
[466:03.62]I mean, yeah.
[466:05.54]If you have like an English accent, you can't just like stop having it.
[466:09.28]Yeah, and okay.
[466:09.80]Yeah, Spider-Man is really good at that.
[466:11.16]He can do that pretty well.
[466:12.47]But not all of us are like Academy Award winning actors.
[466:21.73]Yes, there are two people that you know.
[466:23.57]Dr. Greg House and Spider-Man are really, really good at it.
[466:31.89]And the guy that played the dragon in Lord of the Rings.
[466:38.64]Mr. Strange.
[466:40.86]Dr. Strange.
[466:45.26]Say popcorn.
[466:47.38]Popcorn.
[466:50.42]Popcorn.
[466:50.86]What's wrong with that?
[466:56.51]Thank you for the $2.50.
[467:00.94]Thank you to Spamite for $3.
[467:02.56]Play my level or else I'll remove your gamer privileges.
[467:06.42]I'm sorry I was not doing donations for levels.
[467:09.55]The one person gave $50 and put a fish in their comment.
[467:11.75]That's the only one I did.
[467:13.87]I kind of wanted this to be throw them in here and we'll play them.
[467:20.03]But I do appreciate the level and hopefully I did get to at least one of them.
[467:23.78]Because I did do a lot.
[467:24.62]I did probably at least like 20 or so.
[467:25.84]20 or 30.
[467:30.03]$50 for levels.
[467:35.65]Pop corn.
[467:38.01]Pop corn.
[467:39.51]Pop corn?
[467:42.65]Thank you for the $3 spam, mate.
[467:48.16]Editing your streams has given me 4% Boston accent.
[467:51.40]Max accent is probably now 20% Boston, 70% British and 10% normal.
[467:53.56]What is normal?
[468:02.95]Hey, Swid, thanks for the $5, Swid Harry.
[468:05.71]Hey, Jerma, are you going to be at Evo?
[468:07.87]I don't know.
[468:10.14]I don't know.
[468:10.46]It's going to be tough.
[468:12.46]Because today is, what, Thursday?
[468:16.16]So Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[468:18.28]I plan on streaming three days in a row.
[468:22.49]But I might, I don't know, because I'm not going to be here.
[468:25.03]I'm not going to be here next week for at least a couple days.
[468:32.14]So it's going to be hard to go to EVO.
[468:34.59]I might try to show up on Sunday just to kind of pop around.
[468:44.54]But if you weren't here earlier, the reason why I'm not going to be here early next week is I am going to the robot facility to... We're going to do a walkthrough.
[468:54.70]We're going to hammer down every single detail.
[468:56.97]I've got to exchange some money.
[469:00.49]And we're going to do some talking.
[469:02.37]We're going to go over everything.
[469:03.69]I want to kind of just be like a name to a face.
[469:09.53]Rather than just... Because I want to know.
[469:11.12]I kind of want to see what's going on.
[469:12.52]See what they're doing.
[469:13.26]See the progress and stuff.
[469:22.30]So I don't just want to be like, hey, let's do all that stuff and then, hey, I'll see you in September.
[469:26.39]By the way, September 21st is the day of that stream.
[469:31.13]Not likely to really be changed.
[469:33.01]I don't think that's going to happen.
[469:34.15]It seems pretty unlikely.
[469:35.59]Because there's like three companies involved.
[469:38.87]So... It's not a case of like, you know, I feel like doing it on next Thursday.
[469:44.99]There's way too many people involved.
[469:46.91]So it's going to be Saturday the 21st.
[469:49.19]I believe it's Saturday.
[469:54.18]Is that a Saturday?
[469:55.82]I think it is.
[469:57.64]Yeah.
[469:58.10]The 21st, Saturday, September.
[470:06.26]What does the carnival stream mean?
[470:08.54]I'll give you a quick little rundown.
[470:11.03]September 21st, I am going to a robot warehouse facility to collaborate with a group of engineers.
[470:18.83]Well, they already would have made them.
[470:21.09]That's what this next week is for.
[470:23.11]to make a bunch of robots with another company to then make them controllable by Twitch to play a bunch of carnival games one of which the main attraction is to dunk me in a dunk tank with a pitching machine it's one of them
[470:55.85]And all the robots are going to be controlled by Twitch.
[471:00.26]Midway games, carnival games, there's going to be a bunch of them.
[471:02.52]There's going to be at least a few different robots that you're going to be able to control as a collective group.
[471:08.38]Let's hope you can do it.
[471:13.09]How did you find the people to do this for you?
[471:15.47]This has taken a year to figure this out.
[471:21.54]I have wanted to do this stream since summertime before I moved to Vegas.
[471:32.32]Is it going to be one game at a time?
[471:34.84]Yes.
[471:44.56]It's going to be a big carnival with a midway, all these booths.
[471:51.51]There might be other things there, other machines to mess around with.
[471:56.33]Over the course of the day, the stream's probably going to be... Well, it depends on how good you guys can play.
[472:03.66]I mean... I mean, we might have to... I don't know.
[472:08.60]If you guys can dunk me in like 10 seconds, then alright.
[472:13.12]We'll see how many times you guys can do it.
[472:16.59]In before it's a bit, it is not.
[472:18.17]I can assure you of that.
[472:20.75]These are real robots, really controlled by you guys, really happening on the 21st.
[472:24.75]It's not a bit.
[472:25.39]I can promise you that.
[472:28.27]I mean, there might be jokes in that stream, but that is actually for real.
[472:31.59]That's not like a joke.
[472:33.11]You will be able to do that.
[472:40.50]Judging by chat's Picross ability, I don't think we're going to be very... We're not going to have to worry about that.
[472:47.74]Thank you.
[472:59.56]You're going to put any protective measures in.
[473:03.14]We have a bunch of ways to... The way that it was described to me, the way that we talked about it, is we can set it, the different inputs, to have to have a certain amount of inputs for it to work.
[473:19.00]So let's say, for instance, let's say it's going really crazy, and there's like 20,000 inputs, and 20,000 of them would like to go left, right?
[473:29.39]We can make it so there has to be a certain amount to make it even move an inch left.
[473:34.67]You know what I'm saying?
[473:36.61]We can kind of mitigate like huge, huge just spam by making... Let's say, oh, turn left needs like 3,000 inputs to go left an inch.
[473:46.60]But right could be like two inputs.
[473:49.02]We might just have fun.
[473:49.94]We might fuck around with it.
[473:53.54]The people that are working with me on this have done shit like this before.
[474:00.31]So they're very knowledgeable on how all this will work.
[474:05.48]They seem to be very, very much in touch with what we want to do.
[474:11.56]Do you get tickets?
[474:13.19]No.
[474:14.07]Not yet.
[474:22.96]I've kind of fought with the idea of, uh, should I do a thing where you, like, give bits and you can, like, play a game or something?
[474:31.30]No, I don't want to do that.
[474:33.34]I feel like it's more fun when everyone's kind of fighting with each other.
[474:38.36]There was also an idea of, like, have a separate segment that was, oh, you have to, if you pay money, you only are the one that gets to control the machine for, like, two or three throws or something, right?
[474:52.27]But then it became... How much money is that?
[474:56.39]What's that going to be?
[474:58.79]Is that a dollar?
[474:59.97]Is that five dollars?
[475:00.73]Is that ten dollars?
[475:02.37]And what happens if like five fucking hundred people do that?
[475:07.02]You're going to have 500 people lined up?
[475:10.12]It's going to take like 12 hours.
[475:18.08]So I think it's more fun when everybody just kind of can try to control it.
[475:24.90]Because that makes more sense, as to the nature of this whole stream in the first place.
[475:33.74]But, besides that, there's another way, maybe to like, oh, if you... One of the things that I thought was interesting, remember the... That, like, cash machine?
[475:42.76]Remember I told you guys I was, like, really good at it?
[475:46.20]Maybe if, like, once every, like, once, like, a hundred bucks comes through, I would, like, get in that thing and try to grab them?
[475:53.20]I don't know.
[475:55.25]There's a lot of different ideas that are not connected to the robots.
[475:59.22]The robots are set in stone.
[476:03.38]And we've got like two or three weeks to figure out kind of the other stuff we want in there to supplement all the cool stuff to do with the robots.
[476:14.99]It's not just going to be
[476:17.68]Here are a bunch of games you control with a robot.
[476:19.80]We're gonna have little segments in between.
[476:21.40]There's gonna be maybe some actors that come through and, you know, clown around in massive gigantic fucking quotes.
[476:36.86]The whole stream will probably be somewhere around like five to seven hours.
[476:39.64]It's gonna be a whole thing.
[476:41.00]It's gonna take that long for you to even probably go through the games themselves.
[476:46.54]This is not going to be like a 30 minute stream.
[476:48.40]This is going to be all day.
[476:50.77]It's going to take probably four, five plus hours to go through all this.
[477:04.85]What time is it going to start?
[477:06.17]It's going to be on Eastern time.
[477:08.68]Although I'm not going to be in Massachusetts like a lot of you might think.
[477:14.04]I will be on Eastern time though.
[477:22.94]September 21st, that's right.
[477:25.66]And besides the robot stuff, these are all just ideas that I'm throwing out.
[477:28.46]Obviously none of this is set in stone besides the date and besides the robots.
[477:32.58]And the games that those robots are controlling.
[477:35.60]We got, remember how I told you that over the next, you know, I said this probably like two or three weeks ago, that I was going to dial back streams to really make sure I get this rolling.
[477:48.10]I make sure I have the necessary time to put into this and I can travel and go back and forth and make sure I can take care of this and make it as good as I can.
[477:56.62]Like this is the reason why, because we still have to figure some of this stuff out.
[478:06.65]But I will give more details when I have them.
[478:10.89]But I am going to hammer pretty much every week here that the 21st is the date that you want to save if you want to be around.
[478:20.10]Should be fun.
[478:37.81]And it's tough with stuff like this because even if I say this right now, tomorrow, a shitload of people are not even going to know that I said this.
[478:46.72]A week from now, a bunch of people, it's not the same people every stream.
[478:51.30]So there's always going to be somebody that needs to kind of know.
[478:54.96]And I think I'm probably going to set up a command to have it just be like, Carnival, hey, September 21st.
[479:00.28]Because every day there's new people.
[479:05.27]So there'll probably be a command.
[479:06.31]I'll probably play, I'll probably get like a little thing made.
[479:09.31]Like a 30 second promo video or something to play over the next like few weeks.
[479:17.19]Sus carnival.
[479:22.49]Pin a tweet.
[479:23.05]Yeah, I'll pin a tweet too.
[479:24.10]That's a good idea.
[479:27.44]What is my pin tweet?
[479:28.30]Oh, it's the t-shirts, right?
[479:36.30]But, uh, we'll move on.
[479:38.78]I just want to be clear about that, because we did- I talked about it a little bit at the beginning of the stream, but not to that level, because we're just kind of sitting here.
[479:47.52]But, uh, thank you to Apple Shift for the $2.50.
[479:53.01]Hey man, I read somewhere that your favorite band is the Gorillaz.
[480:00.17]It is.
[480:01.31]What's your favorite song of theirs?
[480:04.09]P.S.
[480:04.71]My friend Briar loves you, but since he lives in Australia, he can't usually watch your streams in full since they're mostly while he is asleep.
[480:12.42]So I'm sending you good vibes on his behalf.
[480:15.22]Thank you for everything.
[480:18.22]Yeah, time zones are really tricky.
[480:21.46]Some of us are just across the entire world from each other.
[480:26.06]Australia, I think, is like plus 16 hours from now.
[480:32.02]From Pacific.
[480:35.07]It's like plus 14 or plus 16.
[480:37.39]It's something crazy.
[480:40.13]The whole day in the future.
[480:42.49]It's 5 p.m.
[480:43.64]right now, Australia.
[480:46.30]Wow.
[480:47.00]It is almost midnight.
[480:48.82]It is 11.59 p.m.
[480:51.14]Thursday.
[480:53.32]So you're telling me that it is 5 p.m.
[480:56.00]Friday.
[480:56.88]Or is it 5 p.m.
[480:57.54]Saturday?
[480:58.02]No, 5 p.m.
[480:58.60]Friday.
[481:02.06]Damn.
[481:02.18]Damn.
[481:03.98]That's very, that's really insane.
[481:07.72]3 p.m.
[481:10.22]Jeez.
[481:10.52]Man, it's like 3 a.m.
[481:12.84]Eastern, too.
[481:13.48]Time zones are fucking messed up.
[481:17.48]But, uh, my favorite song from the Gorillaz is, I mean, I just like Stylo.
[481:23.59]Stylo just, I like the, I like the kick of Stylo.
[481:30.14]If it wasn't Stylo, it would probably be... Uh... Hmm.
[481:37.71]There's a lot.
[481:42.29]Probably something from Plastic Beach.
[481:45.10]Or Demon Days.
[481:46.82]Pick a random song out of either of those two albums.
[481:51.88]Everything else is like number two.
[481:56.22]Melancholy Hill is good too.
[481:57.62]Yeah, it is.
[482:00.15]I liked a lot of the stuff in, um, in Humans.
[482:07.45]That album was kind of hit or miss for me.
[482:12.86]But the ones that hit, I thought were really, really good.
[482:21.01]Yeah, Stylo, though.
[482:22.05]For sure.
[482:28.38]I don't know a lot of people that liked Humans.
[482:30.48]Yeah, but that's what I mean, though.
[482:31.22]Like, half the tracks on Humans, I was kind of like, ooh, what the fuck is going on here?
[482:34.65]A lot of the tracks on Humans were just kind of like noise.
[482:40.09]It was really experimental noise songs.
[482:43.34]And then the other half were like, oh, this fucking, this is awesome.
[482:46.58]This is exactly what I'm looking for.
[482:58.77]But thank you to Gnarly for the 250.
[483:00.09]They just say donation.
[483:01.61]Thank you.
[483:03.25]Thank you for the donation.
[483:08.25]That was Gnarly.
[483:11.37]A Daring Shepherd.
[483:12.47]Thanks for the $4.
[483:14.33]Have my paper trading goods.
[483:15.83]I will take them.
[483:19.11]Thank you.
[483:22.21]A General Arse.
[483:24.07]Thanks for the $3.
[483:24.49]Play my level.
[483:28.57]Sorry, I didn't do the levels from the donations.
[483:34.73]Hopefully somebody played it.
[483:36.71]But I appreciate it.
[483:37.31]Thank you for the three bucks.
[483:40.61]Vitus, thanks for the $10.80 is another level code.
[483:43.91]Beat it if you think you can.
[483:48.73]I'm sorry, I was not doing donation levels.
[483:54.13]I guess $10 is a lot of money.
[483:58.19]Thank you for the $10.80.
[483:58.69]People get scammed.
[484:03.39]Well, hold on though.
[484:05.44]I never said that I was taking donations for levels.
[484:09.72]I never said that.
[484:13.68]I didn't say I was doing that.
[484:26.13]I set a precedent?
[484:29.78]No, I didn't.
[484:33.74]I didn't take the second bribe level.
[484:35.40]There were two bribe levels.
[484:38.26]And I didn't do the second one.
[484:42.27]The Bala Koala gave $55 and said, Hey, I heard you're taking bribes for levels.
[484:46.65]And I didn't do it.
[484:48.65]In fact, uh... I didn't even say this donation on stream.
[484:53.33]Because I didn't see it.
[484:55.85]Uh...
[484:58.12]Sorry.
[484:58.78]That's a lot of fucking money to miss during the stream.
[485:02.76]I must have been in the middle of a meltdown.
[485:06.26]But that's $55.
[485:06.70]5,500 bits.
[485:08.75]I hate missing huge donations like this.
[485:16.63]I always feel like a dick.
[485:19.44]But Bala Koala, if you're still here, that's a lot of money.
[485:21.68]Thank you so much.
[485:25.05]If you make a robot that dabs when someone donates a $10 bill, that robot would never stop the whole stream.
[485:33.18]I thought, I don't know, money gets weird because I don't want to just... Sure, okay, if I could have like a robot in the background that every time somebody donated $10, the thing dabbed.
[485:44.89]And I didn't even bring it up, it just was there.
[485:49.45]But I don't want to, like, put my, like, financial obligations onto other people.
[485:56.57]Because, like, I decided I was going to do this.
[486:00.69]This stream is going to cost a lot of money.
[486:02.85]But, like, you didn't, like, tell me to do that.
[486:06.62]It wasn't like, oh, jeez, Jerma.
[486:08.48]You know, we voted.
[486:09.04]20,000 of us voted.
[486:09.42]And 19,990 of us want you to do a robot carnival stream.
[486:19.99]what do it you know I hey I'm gonna do this stream and it's it's gonna cost this and this is what's gonna be uh please pay for it now everybody like you already did I think that's something that a lot of people might overlook is you already have where do you think I got the money to do this stream uh
[486:48.98]I didn't get it from, like, my cryptocurrency investments, I'll tell ya.
[487:02.79]He stole it.
[487:12.04]He finally admits it.
[487:13.30]I'm just fucking kidding.
[487:15.22]Come on.
[487:24.04]You got it from gambling.
[487:24.98]Yeah, I put it all.
[487:26.02]I put all my money on black and hit it once and freaked the fuck out and exhaled really hard and said, holy shit, and I put it all in my bank account.
[487:43.95]No, I don't... Essentially, to me, it's...
[487:48.02]this stream was made possible because there's a lot of people that donate and a lot of people that sub to this channel so the money that comes from that that goes into this is you know it's it kind of it's paid for now um am I like a psycho for doing this maybe I don't know it's very possible maybe one day we'll talk about uh how much it was
[488:18.29]but that's not a conversation for now.
[488:20.82]Enjoy it, let's have fun, and don't worry about me.
[488:32.56]As part of your subbed shareholders, I demand the dabbing robot.
[488:42.63]And, by the way, that is, like, easy.
[488:43.85]If anyone wanted to, like, contribute or something, it could just be there.
[488:46.76]But then I would want to make it something that it wasn't just me trying to delete money from, like... Oh, hey, watch the dabbing robot.
[488:54.68]It's ten bucks.
[488:55.56]Better do it.
[488:57.07]We'll see.
[488:59.69]But, let's keep going.
[489:00.87]We're almost done.
[489:03.71]We had...
[489:06.00]Freudian Weapon, thanks for the 250.
[489:07.38]Thanks for playing my level tonight.
[489:08.44]I knew you could do it, but I'm glad it wasn't too easy for you.
[489:11.57]Now to count down the days till the carnival.
[489:14.65]Me too.
[489:21.17]I'm counting them down as well.
[489:27.16]Thank you, Acknowledge John, for the three bucks.
[489:30.49]Okay, I'm sorry for yelling at you when you were playing Mario, but Mom said it was my turn when you finished the level, and I thought you were just playing bad on purpose.
[489:43.66]Thank you, Esvada Escalata, for the 250.
[489:46.68]Jeremiah, I just want to say I enjoyed the bit where you pretended to be a good gamer for once.
[489:51.18]Sometimes I turn it on.
[489:53.02]Sometimes.
[489:54.56]It's time for slime.
[489:55.30]Thanks for the $5.
[489:56.08]Thanks for playing my level, jermaHeart.
[489:59.42]Dude, you know what I like?
[490:06.79]I'm just thinking about what I want.
[490:08.71]But it's not going to happen, because we've already solidified everything that was going to happen, because we're getting too close.
[490:15.03]I just thought... One of those old Nickelodeon pie machines.
[490:18.82]And just sit in, like, the... If I say, like, a really bad joke and, like, it's not funny, then I gotta go sit in, like, the pie pod.
[490:27.69]You remember that fucking thing?
[490:32.03]Oh, the slime bucket.
[490:33.05]You know what?
[490:33.47]That might not be that expensive.
[490:36.32]Having a slime bucket.
[490:38.78]Okay, I'm gonna do, like, a secret slime action.
[490:43.58]Hold on, let me think about that.
[490:45.32]I'll get back to you.
[490:57.46]The ultimate -2.
[490:58.87]Yeah, we'll see.
[491:01.89]But... Thank you.
[491:07.50]Thank you to Devakitty for the 250.
[491:10.32]Jerma looking forward to the 21st.
[491:11.10]Me too.
[491:13.31]In more recent news, however, I've been in the process of being approved for my HRT for like 19 months now, and hopefully the fifth is the very last of my appointments, and I'm stoked.
[491:23.55]Now, if you'd excuse me, I'm gonna go eat some of these 1.7 kilogram bag of hot wings I bought for like $7 while enjoying my favorite bite- my favorite bite it in Mario over and over again.
[491:34.64]And then- did you call me Mario?
[491:38.40]In- oh, in Mario.
[491:42.27]Alright, I gotta, I gotta do this, this, the math here.
[491:45.05]1.7 kg is how much?
[491:50.50]What bag?
[491:51.22]How big is that bag?
[491:56.04]1.7 kg.
[491:58.28]That's how many, is it a, how many pounds?
[492:01.61]That's seven pounds.
[492:03.29]No, wait, no, no, isn't one, uh, kilogram 2.2?
[492:07.31]So what, that's like three?
[492:09.74]Three and a half?
[492:10.88]That's still a lot.
[492:12.66]That's a heavy bag.
[492:14.76]Seven dollars for two, three, four pounds of wings?
[492:20.00]Enjoy them.
[492:23.35]I like want that now.
[492:28.13]I so badly want that right now.
[492:31.65]What time is it?
[492:32.17]It's two.
[492:32.59]It's like late.
[492:33.09]It's like twelve o'clock.
[492:37.89]I shouldn't have jumped over the fucking stupid ass like fire pole a thousand times.
[492:43.29]If I had just turned off the switch like 30 or 40 minutes before I did, I would have been able to eat pizza.
[492:50.84]Great.
[493:01.36]I'm- now what am I- I'm gonna have to go like eat water.
[493:07.66]I'm gonna go microwave water and fucking, like, flour.
[493:14.30]Ster it up.
[493:22.17]But thank you, Devakitty.
[493:23.27]Appreciate the $2.50.
[493:25.41]Thank you to Manboy for the $2.50.
[493:26.59]Hey, Jerm, I'm really excited for the carnival stream.
[493:28.45]I was gonna attend my wife's and her boyfriend's wedding on the 21st, but not anymore.
[493:37.90]wait wait what it took me a second to figure that out uh okay sorry um thank you man boy for the 250. that's well I'm not sure you'd um thank you for the 250.
[494:14.58]Thank you to Devakitty for the 250.
[494:18.40]Gee, Willaker's big stream coming up on the 24th.
[494:20.60]I was going to attend the birthday of my firstborn on that day while also delivering my second child and going to my grandma's 100th birthday.
[494:28.13]But there's a Jerma stream on, so I won't go to any of those really important events because I got to watch the silly streamer in the internet.
[494:39.63]You guys can go to like your family get togethers Just pull up your phone and just you'd pull up your phone.
[494:49.82]No, don't do that.
[494:50.64]Don't do that.
[494:51.08]Don't pull up your phone.
[494:52.22]That's rude.
[494:52.76]I
[494:54.69]Look, here's the end-all, be-all way to get out of any of this shit.
[494:59.37]Not to get out of it, but you know what I mean?
[495:01.65]Go, enjoy yourself, and then after like an hour or two, just say, like, hold your stomach, walk up to somebody and be like, Oh, it's bad.
[495:10.74]I'm sorry, but I've got to go now.
[495:12.58]And then like, you know, bye, good to see you.
[495:15.22]And then leave, and nobody cares.
[495:22.10]You're not the bad guy.
[495:25.51]In fact, they start to think, maybe they are, because why are you at my house consuming the things in my house, and now all of a sudden you have like a stomach diarrhea?
[495:38.08]Oh, I gotta figure out how's that happening.
[495:51.54]That's really bad advice.
[495:57.89]Yeah, because it was not real.
[496:09.43]Don't make it sudden, though.
[496:11.23]Or they might find out and get mad.
[496:12.95]No, yeah, I'm not saying do it immediately.
[496:16.08]You're gonna drive up, pull into the driveway, be like, oh, hey, how are you?
[496:20.42]Ooh, yeah, it's been, what a great day it is.
[496:23.10]Oh, happy birthday.
[496:24.93]Oh, my stomach is really bothering me.
[496:27.55]You know, we gotta fucking get out of here.
[496:29.21]Can I use your bathroom?
[496:33.84]Or, you know, I'm just going to sit there in the middle.
[496:36.60]Okay, here we go.
[496:37.80]Oh, there's like 10 of us sitting around.
[496:39.52]Oh, there's George.
[496:40.56]And there's Aunt Edna.
[496:41.92]They're talking.
[496:43.26]Oh, Aunt Edna said, let me tell you something about being Republican.
[496:47.50]And then George is like, oh, the Democrats.
[496:49.67]Did you see?
[496:50.41]Oh, my stomach.
[496:51.11]And you stand up.
[496:52.33]Oh, my stomach's killing me.
[496:53.73]I'm going to shit my... Actually, that's a great way to get out of that.
[496:56.95]Take that advice.
[496:57.53]That's great advice.
[497:02.23]what perfect advice that is.
[497:12.48]You can use that anywhere.
[497:16.31]You can even use that if you don't feel like getting like out of bed.
[497:22.46]Hey, um, are you gonna, like, get out of bed- Oh, I wish I could, but, you know, I would get away from me, my stomach, you know, oh, it's all gonna shit.
[497:31.48]Oh, okay, oh, okay, bye, bye, bye.
[497:36.36]Hey, the weeds are getting kind of long outside.
[497:39.42]Oh, but, you know, I would hate to shit on them.
[497:42.61]Yeah, you know, you're right, I guess I'll do it.
[497:48.32]It's just, it's a fifth grader discovering how to lie to get out of school.
[497:52.23]But the problem is, if you do that too often, then yeah.
[498:00.92]It's like going to the... Hey, come on.
[498:04.46]Everybody used to do this.
[498:06.08]You take a thermometer, right?
[498:07.78]So, like, mom comes in.
[498:08.77]Here's a thermometer.
[498:09.87]Oh, boy.
[498:10.49]Oh, I think you're sick today.
[498:12.23]Oh, yeah, mom.
[498:13.01]I don't feel good today.
[498:13.93]Well, here's a thermometer.
[498:14.69]Let's see if you got a fever.
[498:16.21]You put it in.
[498:16.85]Mom leaves the room.
[498:17.63]And there you go.
[498:19.17]To the sink.
[498:20.07]The bathroom sink.
[498:21.31]You put on hot fucking water and you hold it under.
[498:24.11]And you know, you're a dumb kid.
[498:25.27]You don't understand.
[498:26.25]So you sit there with burning fucking hot water on it.
[498:28.91]And you end up at like 108 degrees on the thermometer.
[498:32.25]You put it back in and you're like, oh mom, something's wrong.
[498:35.93]Like, oh, let me see, honey.
[498:38.05]Oh, you're dead.
[498:39.17]You're not alive.
[498:40.17]You're actually not alive right now.
[498:42.36]Interesting.
[498:43.10]Oh, you know, you can't go to school today.
[498:46.15]A hundred and like seven degrees?
[498:47.97]A hundred and like six degree fever.
[498:50.12]Wow.
[498:50.52]I remember one time I put orange juice in my mouth.
[499:02.99]And my grandmother was there at the time.
[499:06.01]And I was like, oh, here we go.
[499:07.37]I'm going to be able to fool my grandmother.
[499:09.10]She's not going to be able to know that I got, I'm just going to like put orange juice in my mouth.
[499:12.60]And like, I lied on the ground face down.
[499:15.24]I could, I put the orange juice in my mouth and like squished it around.
[499:18.64]So it was real salivary.
[499:20.28]My grandmother was walking down the hall and I was waiting.
[499:22.60]Here she comes.
[499:23.80]Prone on the ground.
[499:26.59]She walked in and I was... I was putting my fist down, up and down.
[499:33.77]Up and down.
[499:34.65]Like pretend I'm a child.
[499:36.24]Pretend having a tantrum.
[499:38.62]And just went... And let it out.
[499:41.08]The orange juice.
[499:43.64]And she just looked at me.
[499:44.38]She's like, you're going to school.
[499:45.84]What are you doing?
[499:49.52]Like it did not even work at all.
[499:51.18]It was like she thought I was doing a joke.
[499:53.56]She's like, clean that up.
[499:54.72]What are you doing?
[499:57.17]You don't even have your clothes on.
[499:58.23]Get in the fucking car.
[500:00.79]Clean that shit up.
[500:01.55]What is this?
[500:03.01]Oh, just kidding, Grandma.
[500:16.76]Kids do dumb things.
[500:22.23]But, I mean, I was... I think I was probably, like, at least... I was old enough to know better.
[500:27.31]Let's put it that way.
[500:27.89]I was, like, 12.
[500:31.54]You know, I was, like... I was, like, 11 or 12.
[500:33.44]Like, come on.
[500:34.12]You're gonna do, like, the fake puke scenario?
[500:36.78]Actually, that's probably the perfect age for it.
[500:46.88]I also used to be scared of the toilet.
[500:48.48]The toilet flushing sound scared me, and I didn't like to go to the bathroom.
[500:54.81]That has nothing to do with pretending to be sick.
[500:59.19]I don't know where that transition came from.
[501:01.51]So... I guess... We're just kind of... I'm just letting it out, I guess.
[501:06.54]I guess we're just talking about it.
[501:15.64]Anyways, let's keep going.
[501:19.70]Thank you to...
[501:22.96]Kikira.
[501:24.76]Kikira.
[501:25.78]For the 250.
[501:28.36]They say, hey, Jerma, my boyfriend Bryce is turning 22 this week.
[501:31.60]Would you wish him a happy birthday?
[501:32.80]He loves your content.
[501:34.36]Absolutely.
[501:38.00]Turn this off.
[501:41.32]Hey, Bryce.
[501:44.44]Heard you're turning 22 this week.

[501:49.42]You're getting there.
[501:50.99]Keep it up.
[501:52.96]Stay on track.
[501:56.24]Okay, that was, hold on a minute.
[501:57.25]That was just like a, that was like a, that website where you pay a celebrity to say something for 10 seconds.
[502:02.83]That was, I just did that.
[502:04.10]I just did like the celebrity, what's it called?
[502:06.20]Like cameo.
[502:11.32]Fiverr?
[502:12.48]They knock out like 40 of those.
[502:14.16]No, no, no, no, no.
[502:14.82]We ain't doing it like that.
[502:16.34]Hey, Bryce.
[502:17.38]Happy fucking birthday.
[502:18.18]Hope you have a good one.
[502:19.86]22 this week.
[502:20.87]Alright.

[502:24.63]Hey.
[502:34.92]Hey.
[502:36.52]Hey.
[502:38.52]Bryce.
[502:40.06]Seriously, happy birthday.
[502:42.76]I'm glad you're part of this community.
[502:45.60]Hope you have a great one.
[502:47.74]22.
[502:48.56]Knock it out of the park.
[502:50.42]Thank you.
[502:52.18]Everybody here says hi.
[502:54.34]We all fucking love you over here.
[502:57.55]Everybody thinks you're fucking awesome.
[502:59.53]All of us in the chat.
[503:00.27]Look at them.
[503:01.25]Do you see it?
[503:06.17]22.
[503:06.21]That's a big one, yeah.
[503:08.77]No, for real, thank you so much for the 250, Kikira, and a special happy birthday to Bryce.
[503:16.68]Keep... I'm not very good at this.
[503:32.71]Keep... Keep... Keep on.
[503:36.65]Yeah.
[503:36.93]Yeah.
[503:39.52]Alright, now cut that up and like make it sound like I'm like smart.
[503:43.68]That's not how you say his name.
[503:46.22]B-R-Y-C-E, Bryce.
[503:48.75]That's not Bryce.
[503:53.43]It's B-R-Y-C-E.
[503:59.47]That's correct.
[504:00.03]Yeah, I would.
[504:00.97]Why is everybody yelling at me?
[504:04.76]Why is everybody yelling at me?
[504:05.80]Did I die on a 1% completion Mario level for the first time?
[504:12.51]Wipe the sweat off the brow!
[504:13.65]Oof.
[504:27.28]Hey, you know for those 1% completion levels, there was like 4,000 people here.
[504:36.26]What is 1% of 4,000?
[504:37.28]4.
[504:37.30]40.
[504:37.70]So... 40 of you get to say, I did it and I could do it.
[504:51.17]3,600 of the rest of you didn't do it.
[504:54.85]Um... Happy birthday, Bryce.
[504:58.23]22?
[505:00.05]Hell yeah.
[505:06.31]You're honestly one of my favorite people in the world, even if you have such shitty tastes.
[505:27.44]That was a very long birthday clip.
[505:31.71]Yeah.
[505:35.43]Fucking comedy.
[505:39.60]But thank you for the $10.
[505:40.80]Jerma put Sunships in F tier.
[505:44.18]I did.
[505:46.04]Abomination Zero, thanks for the five dollars.
[505:48.73]Please play this level.
[505:49.99]It's my birthday.
[505:51.69]Hold on.
[505:52.21]Somebody's driving by really fast.
[505:54.31]Sorry I didn't play that level.
[505:56.71]But happy birthday.
[505:58.41]Is your name... What's your name?
[506:02.09]Abomination Zero.
[506:04.46]Happy birthday.
[506:11.38]What are sun chips?
[506:14.50]Um...
[506:16.19]They're this weird, like, wavy, like, really grainy wheat kind of tasting, dusted with... They're, like, crispy, but they're not.
[506:24.69]They're, like, cardboard crispy.
[506:29.23]They don't... After, like, you eat three of them, you don't taste it anymore.
[506:32.02]Okay, I mean, I don't... I would eat them, maybe.
[506:39.04]Okay, let's put it this way.
[506:39.86]If a stewardess... Or, okay, like a flight attendant, right?
[506:46.08]Walk down the aisle with a bag of SunChips and that's all that was left?
[506:50.60]Oh, wait, where are the Cheez-Its?
[506:52.04]We don't have any.
[506:53.22]Where are the, um, the pretzels?
[506:55.15]I'm sorry, we're out of those too.
[506:56.69]Where are the, um, what else you got in there?
[506:59.11]What are those, uh, peanuts?
[507:01.81]No, we don't have those.
[507:03.29]Oh, you got SunChips.
[507:04.79]Okay.
[507:06.69]I guess I'll have a pineapple juice.
[507:10.88]Wouldn't even need it on a plane.
[507:20.36]Hey, InvaderZ, thanks for the three dollars.
[507:24.18]Uh, hey dude.
[507:25.06]My sister and I got two XL rats today and I wanted to name mine Jeremy.
[507:31.93]But she wouldn't let me.
[507:33.23]Probably for the best.
[507:36.19]Anyway, I'm excited to be a rat dad.
[507:38.17]Love watching your streams.
[507:43.42]Hey, can I name him Jeremy?
[507:46.16]No.
[507:47.38]Alright.
[507:56.86]Music's muted.
[507:58.04]Oh, fuck.
[508:01.24]Congratulations on the rats.
[508:03.25]They are intelligent.
[508:04.13]They're fun.
[508:05.37]They're cuddly.
[508:06.53]They're passionate.
[508:08.31]They're empathetic.
[508:11.15]They're very fast.
[508:13.67]They're very agile.
[508:19.77]Take it from somebody that has never owned one.
[508:23.29]but sees cute videos of them all the time, I'm informed.
[508:32.60]But thank you.
[508:33.50]Good luck.
[508:34.30]That sounds awesome.
[508:36.64]Hey, Weskerun, thanks for the $5.
[508:38.38]Cheers.
[508:38.70]I'm a longtime fan.
[508:39.66]First time on stream.
[508:40.52]What up?
[508:41.80]What up?
[508:43.88]They also subbed right before that, too.
[508:45.34]So that's a double.
[508:46.77]Thank you.
[508:52.61]Thank you, Weskerun.
[508:54.35]And, uh, welcome to the stream.
[508:56.05]First time on the stream.
[509:03.32]Thank you, Elizabeth, for the three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight dollars.
[509:12.91]Thank you for the eight dollars, uh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that is not, that is incorrect.
[509:19.61]Elizabeth gave $3, and then Erelis gave $5.
[509:23.79]It was Elizabeth, and then Erelis.
[509:28.54]So, Elizabeth, thanks for the $3.
[509:30.26]Am I ever going to go back to play more Dreams, or did you forget about that game?
[509:34.37]Uh, I actually just got...
[509:39.02]uh sad because I wanted to use the move controllers and I realized that I gave my psvr away which included the ps camera so I have the move controllers here and I was getting it set up and I go oh the camera's not here I gave it away and then that for some reason was the wall me not getting a new ps camera because I really wanted to learn how to sculpt with the um move controllers
[510:12.35]But when does that game actually release?
[510:18.96]It was in, like, creator access, right?
[510:21.02]Or creator early access, early access.
[510:23.08]Is it just there still?
[510:28.36]It was a really interesting game.
[510:30.48]But it was kind of complicated.
[510:31.86]It was not complicated in the sense of creating things, but... It takes a lot of time to be able to get anything done.
[510:40.27]Which I really don't have.
[510:43.83]I wish I had the time to dedicate like two or three weeks straight to learning how to do that game very well.
[510:49.88]But I just don't.
[510:50.82]I just can't.
[510:54.81]It's a really cool game though.
[511:04.61]But thank you, Erroless, for the $5.
[511:08.41]Are my file names like filename01.file?
[511:13.15]How do you format your file names?
[511:15.93]Well, I can tell you right now.
[511:18.05]Let's see.
[511:18.45]Let's just look and go into a folder and some files that I recently named.
[511:22.69]Let's see what they say.
[511:25.07]I'm going to go through here.
[511:29.52]I do one of two things.
[511:31.02]I either just write the first word that the thing is.
[511:36.44]Okay, so... In this folder I got... The old emote.
[511:45.87]So this is just... The title is just Old Face.
[511:48.55]Old Face Final.
[511:50.95]Old.
[511:53.91]Is also... Let's go into this one.
[512:00.84]Okay, let's see.
[512:04.06]Setup.
[512:07.08]Uh, alright.
[512:11.02]A2.
[512:11.28]I don't know what any of these are.
[512:21.57]08?
[512:24.64]No, these are like... I don't even have any, like, files anymore.
[512:27.08]I used to have so many more.
[512:28.58]What is this?
[512:28.98]What the fuck is this?
[512:34.27]Oh, this is the highlights.
[512:36.19]Let's read this.
[512:36.97]Tell me if you think this is funny.
[512:39.31]I wrote it down.
[512:39.87]Okay.
[512:41.15]So, remember the highlights stream thing that I wanted to do with the highlights magazine?
[512:44.93]We got five to six pages of dot to dots.
[512:48.66]Five pages of Where's Waldo.
[512:52.06]Two to three hidden object pages.
[512:53.40]Two to three coloring pages.
[512:54.70]A joke section.
[512:57.96]User submitted stories.
[512:59.68]Ads.
[512:59.92]What is ads here for?
[513:03.63]Two to three pages of ads.
[513:06.16]Was I making a joke to myself later on that I would read later?
[513:08.84]That's weird.
[513:19.20]Gotta have ads, apparently.
[513:21.10]Uh, no, I usually just write the first word.
[513:23.32]If it's a picture, I just say, like, oh, it's a, uh, let's say it's a picture of a dog.
[513:27.66]Like, dog one.
[513:29.26]Oh, no, no, it's a, this, uh, it's a water slide.
[513:32.48]Uh, slide.
[513:33.66]I just, and then they kind of, sometimes you just slide, and you write slide again, and then it's slide in parentheses two.
[513:40.96]Or slide parentheses one.
[513:50.53]But let's get the credits on here.
[513:59.11]Thanks for watching, guys.
[513:59.79]See you tomorrow.
[514:02.03]We will figure something out.
[514:04.03]As we typically do.
[514:08.61]Here come all of the subs.
[514:09.87]Thank you, everybody.
[514:14.07]And there were a shitload of them.
[514:20.35]Resubs, community subs, gifted subs, new subs, all of you.
[514:31.43]It's going by real fast.
[514:36.59]Yeah, good night, everybody.
[514:37.29]We'll see you tomorrow.
[514:38.67]There's still a couple bits left to do.
[514:44.48]We got Future Gamer.
[514:45.38]Thanks for $2.50.
[514:48.03]Did you hear about the grasshopper pizza in retaliation to the Vegas invasion?
[514:52.28]Also, have you had any run-ins with the grasshoppers?
[514:54.30]They're everywhere.
[514:56.96]And for some weird reason, if you don't know, Las Vegas is seen because we had such a wet spring.
[515:05.43]We had a lot of water here this past, uh, spring.
[515:08.93]So they were able, I guess, to stop here, or breed here, or whatever the hell, I have no idea.
[515:13.88]But there's millions.
[515:16.18]Everywhere.
[515:16.60]They're everywhere.
[515:17.88]In every corner, in every fucking place.
[515:21.14]grasshoppers and for some weird reason I don't know why they're like this they're not scary they don't bite they don't sting they don't do anything bad but they try to just fly into your face I don't know why you'll open a door to leave somewhere and there'll be a couple that just jump right into you like into you're trying to get in your mouth I don't know why they do that
[515:50.98]You want to see something crazy?
[515:52.45]You want to see some biblical, crazy, like, conspiracy theory end of the world shit?
[515:59.25]Go look up the picture of all the grasshoppers swarming the light at the Luxor.
[516:06.14]Las Vegas has this big casino, a pyramid, called the Luxor.
[516:10.82]It's a huge pyramid with a gigantic light on top that beams into the stratosphere.
[516:19.30]It goes, it's like, you can see it from space.
[516:23.49]So already, like, wait, why is there a pyramid with a giant light shooting at the sky, right?
[516:28.03]And now you've got grasshoppers flying around it and inside of it.
[516:33.43]So you've got, like, the pyramid light to the sky and the biblical, I don't know what's going to happen, man.
[516:41.31]Biblical fucking grasshoppers, locusts, in that pyramid.
[516:47.97]Somebody's got it right here, yeah.
[516:52.24]Look at that shit.
[517:01.63]That's nightmare fuel.
[517:03.57]Yeah, it is.
[517:06.99]But it's been okay.
[517:08.78]The last couple of days, you see them still jumping around, but not like it was last week.
[517:18.61]But, you know, whatever.
[517:21.28]I'll take grasshoppers.
[517:23.60]Yeah, you know, I used to live in Massachusetts.
[517:26.26]I'll take plague biblical grasshoppers over one afternoon around mosquitoes.
[517:33.47]Ever again.
[517:35.91]Just saying.
[517:42.80]But we have a couple more.
[517:43.52]We got an error list for 250.
[517:44.86]In all seriousness, looking forward to September 21st and appreciate how much work you put into all this.
[517:50.92]Hopefully it's worth it.
[517:52.06]I think it will be.
[517:58.87]Time will tell.
[517:59.87]Should be fun.
[518:03.93]Yran, thanks for the 250.
[518:04.93]Hey, Jerma, I'm pretty involved in the community of the game called Osu!
[518:08.91]And a little while ago, a player mapped your song into the game, and now it's a classic in that scene and introduced a lot of people to you.
[518:16.87]Just thought it would be cool to tell you if you haven't seen it.
[518:20.83]Is this the rat song?
[518:22.86]I think we have seen this.
[518:23.74]Is this the rats?
[518:25.76]Yeah, we've seen this one before.
[518:32.82]Yep.
[518:35.85]Wow, this is so cool.
[518:43.44]Yeah, I remember watching this.
[518:44.54]I kind of want to play osu!
[518:55.37]again.
[518:55.63]I've never played it.
[518:59.09]I feel like I would be kind of good at that game.
[519:02.09]Because if there's one thing that I know how to do well, I have really good reaction speed.
[519:08.15]I do.
[519:11.57]I might not have very much of anything else, but I know that I have really good, like, reaction times for stuff like that.
[519:25.78]Yeah, isn't it like a light gun game?
[519:27.54]Isn't osu!
[519:28.56]essentially a light gun rhythm game with your mouse?
[519:38.45]Hmm.
[519:40.76]here I'll show it we'll skim through it the rats song bring your own phone well your own real phone when you switch to Google five don't buy that don't buy that yeah see it's like you got like the mouse it's f
[520:08.96]I feel like I would be alright at this if I memorized it.
[520:14.30]I mean, maybe not this good.
[520:15.98]He's using a tablet, holy shit.
[520:29.23]That's next level.
[520:34.28]Have they missed one time?
[520:39.45]Oh my god.
[520:54.80]That's mesmerizing.
[520:56.24]Man, don't you feel like some of these people should go into surgery?
[521:00.35]You know what I mean?
[521:05.94]Like, that's like surgeon level of precision.
[521:15.10]Okay, if I was getting like an operation and I got to pick one person that wasn't a doctor and had no medical background to perform my surgery, I'd be like, can you get that OSU guy down here?
[521:47.67]There have been studies that non-gamer surgeons are much better at Super Monkey Ball than other non-gamers.
[521:56.76]What?
[522:04.38]Did I read that wrong?
[522:05.38]No, I didn't.
[522:05.84]Did I?
[522:11.26]They don't have precision.
[522:12.62]They have memory.
[522:14.54]Yeah, okay, so just... Let's say I was getting like a... Like a gallstone removed.
[522:20.85]Make a song that was just the gallstone surgery.
[522:25.57]And just tell them to do it.
[522:27.77]Give them the song.
[522:29.09]Have them memorize it and do it really well.
[522:30.87]And it's just called gallstones.
[522:34.41]And then I'll lie down on my back and you can just put the fucking gas on my mouth.
[522:38.52]And then just play the song and let them do it.
[522:41.80]Just put a scalpel in his hand this time.
[522:57.30]I'm of the belief that you got to be a little insane to want to be a surgeon and like cut inside people surgeons love super monkey ball why super monkey ball I don't understand I kind of think it's about the money yeah I mean if a good surgeon can make
[523:25.96]Well, I mean, a good surgeon definitely can't make as much as a Minecraft YouTuber, so... I don't know.
[523:46.22]Just wait till all these surgeons figure out they can just play Minecraft.
[524:04.96]How has he not opened the link?
[524:06.39]I don't click links!
[524:07.67]Links freak me out!
[524:10.79]Doctors put scalpels down for video game controllers.
[524:14.62]This is- what is this video?
[524:20.14]Ever since the day I first did laparoscopic surgery, I said, oh my goodness, we have to do more.
[524:24.80]Is the reason why I can do this so well because I play video games?
[524:27.98]And I said, wow, that is an interesting academic question.
[524:30.72]And so that brought me to do three years of research on video games and how they impact laparoscopic surgery.
[524:39.10]And that's what brought us here today, that video games can help you be more efficient and also suppress errors in surgery.
[524:53.49]I can't handle this right now.
[524:58.61]I can't handle this.
[524:59.55]I can't.
[525:00.07]It's too late.
[525:00.87]It's been nine hours.
[525:01.59]I gotta go to bed.
[525:03.05]I can't watch surgeons play Super Monkey Ball right now.
[525:06.25]To me, that's like going over the edge.
[525:13.39]Am I going to Evo?
[525:15.25]I might be there on Sunday.
[525:17.77]I might show up on Sunday and just kind of walk around with locusts.
[525:26.48]But thank you, final bit from Stuff from Thing.
[525:30.02]Thanks for $5.
[525:32.24]They say, Jeremy, I made this a few days ago and I wanted you to see it.
[525:36.57]Love what you do.
[525:39.87]Oh, I did see this.
[525:40.83]The fireman gif.
[525:43.11]It's really cute.
[525:44.85]With the stretchy legs.
[525:48.38]If I see you there, can I have an autograph?
[525:51.00]No, I'm going to be there in disguise.
[525:53.67]I'm gonna have like the glasses and the mustache and just like with like a... I'm just gonna sit like in the back with like a fucking hat on and like a mustache and shit.
[526:10.14]Let's play a look.
[526:16.30]You wanna see?
[526:18.34]Look for the guy with the mustache.
[526:19.38]See, that's what I just told you, but now it's a beard.
[526:23.64]I know Jerm is wearing a fake mustache.
[526:29.34]And now I'm going to be in a Master Chief costume.
[526:33.45]Good luck.
[526:37.39]He's going to be in a Master Chief costume.
[526:38.91]Spread that around.
[526:40.51]And now I'm going to be dressed as a night elf from Warcraft.
[526:47.02]Good luck.
[526:52.98]Five foot Master Chief.
[526:58.54]You don't know how tall Master Chief is.
[527:00.10]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[527:01.01]There's a biography from Master Chief and it tells his height.
[527:15.73]He's six feet tall.
[527:16.61]Whatever.
[527:21.45]He's not that tall.
[527:23.50]Master Chief is six feet tall.
[527:25.42]That's not that huge for your huge Super Master Chief guy.
[527:37.61]But that's it.
[527:38.81]I'll see you tomorrow.
[527:40.05]Kind of a long one tonight, but, you know, I've been gone for a while, so... I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[527:46.14]Same time, same place.
[527:48.06]Take care, guys.
[527:50.72]Have a good one.
[528:00.59]Thank you.
