[00:24.24]Hello.
[00:24.72]Hey, man.
[00:25.74]Hey, what's up?
[00:28.23]I didn't even do my tweet yet.
[00:30.63]Oh, you said hi there.
[00:31.97]I thought that was an invitation.
[00:33.43]Well, I said hi there because you said you had me say hello.
[00:38.03]So I was responding to myself before you.
[00:40.24]What are you talking about?
[00:41.56]What do you mean?
[00:42.92]You just you have like a soundboard that says, hello.
[00:47.56]Can I at least give you a new one?
[00:50.11]a new hello yeah that one's old I don't like it I don't I don't know if I have it set up correctly right now uh say something hello I don't have it set up right alright do you really want me to take the moment and get the new hello no no god no oh god no why not hello
[01:19.11]Do you have a folder on your computer that's just Jerma saying hello?
[01:25.07]Wow, ego on this guy.
[01:26.15]It's also Ashley and Ronnie and I think someone else.
[01:30.39]It's just a randomized hello from multiple people.
[01:33.83]Oh, it's randomized.
[01:34.99]Okay.
[01:35.15]Alright.
[01:38.40]Let me tweet as a TF2 with Ster Loves Food 2014 time machine active.
[01:44.08]That looks good.
[01:47.01]Looks good to me.
[01:49.93]It does.
[01:50.71]Okay.
[01:52.29]Hi, Ster.
[01:53.09]How are you?
[01:54.45]I'm good.
[01:55.27]How the heck are you?
[01:55.89]I'm doing a lot of headshots.
[01:57.06]I'm going crazy with the headshots and my chat's still saying, LOL, aim for the head.
[02:02.00]So good luck today, pal.
[02:04.14]Alright.
[02:04.52]So are we going to be on a team together and we're going to queue for Team Fortress 2?
[02:09.70]Are we?
[02:10.07]Yeah.
[02:14.66]Can we please, God?
[02:15.88]Alright, do you want to... Do I have to wait for you to be done?
[02:19.10]Uh, no, I can leave.
[02:21.08]Are you ready, like, now?
[02:22.28]Or are you ready, like... Oh, I'm ready.
[02:23.88]Hold on.
[02:24.72]I didn't say... I didn't do my, like, intro.
[02:27.00]Shut up!
[02:27.32]Shut up!
[02:27.66]Shut up!
[02:27.94]Yeah, I'm ready.
[02:30.38]Can you invite me?
[02:31.97]Yeah.
[02:33.61]I should be able to be invited to a game.
[02:37.87]You just have to be appearing online.
[02:39.91]I mean, uh...
[02:44.06]God.
[02:44.56]There, there, there, there!
[02:45.58]You're about to throw a tantrum!
[02:47.30]There, I'm on!
[02:48.22]Is your name, like, a pee-pee?
[02:50.47]It's Frank the Fish.
[02:51.69]You'll find it.
[02:57.91]Pee-pee-da-poo-poo!
[03:00.19]Did it work?
[03:03.79]You have to be in the game.
[03:05.25]I'm in the game.
[03:08.19]Well, it didn't work.
[03:10.06]Why not?
[03:11.34]Oh, wait, wait, wait!
[03:13.02]Are you me?
[03:15.14]yes alright I think it's gonna happen I said I said yes I said I clicked on play game you sure yeah what's happening I have to rejoin maybe let me try inviting you you have to do it from the main menu not the Steam invite
[03:48.92]oh shit uh I've disabled my entire friend panel like in the config file uh hold on a second okay how come I have this thing next to my name alright you know what you carry on I'll get this figured out I'll get this figured out I downloaded a custom hud and shit and I I deleted the whole friend panel
[04:18.15]You need the friend panel.
[04:21.95]Hold on.
[04:24.42]Here's the bigger question, though.
[04:25.78]Why... How come my Steam is permanently broken?
[04:28.42]What do you mean permanently broken?
[04:30.75]I can't ever be invited to... What's going on with my voice?
[04:34.01]Why did you do this?
[04:37.74]I can't get invited to any games nobody can ever invite me I'm like permanently blocked forever you might be shadow banned but this one again is not like technically Steam invites don't work this is from the main menu alright give me a second I can invite you in two seconds yeah maybe you have your privacy on no friends I'm ashamed of my friends and I didn't want their names to appear on my stream wait a minute
[05:04.23]You don't want your friends like furry avatars to appear.
[05:07.55]No, it's just like you get like 7,000 friend requests.
[05:11.53]Steam did this thing where you could never like stop that from happening.
[05:14.79]You remember that?
[05:17.90]No.
[05:19.90]No, I remember having so many friend requests that you actually couldn't send anymore.
[05:23.88]And I left it that way so that I wouldn't get anymore.
[05:26.12]And every time I wanted to actually let someone on my friends list, I had to like ignore and deny one person.
[05:33.07]Otherwise, they couldn't send a friend request because Steam couldn't handle it.
[05:38.92]Join through the console command.
[05:40.22]No, we have to be in a party because we're queuing up casual.
[05:44.48]Okay, hold on.
[05:45.48]Let me take one second and see if there's, like, something fucked up in my Steam.
[05:49.24]Because, like, I swear to God I have this problem all the time.
[05:50.95]If your chat tells you to do something, they're telling you how to do it from the perspective of it's 2010.
[05:55.25]That's true.
[05:56.89]Hold on.
[05:58.45]So when they tell you, like, oh, do the Sandman-Geoteen combo, it'll be fun.
[06:02.37]Don't listen to them.
[06:06.32]Yeah, like, friends.
[06:10.86]Did I...
[06:12.03]I don't get it.
[06:12.49]I'm just gonna turn the panel back on, just to add you.
[06:14.19]I don't care.
[06:15.53]Yeah, I understand.
[06:16.19]You know what I mean?
[06:17.18]I don't know why.
[06:18.06]Like, I just can't ever be invited anywhere.
[06:20.96]My Steam profile is private?
[06:23.36]But yours is too, isn't it?
[06:24.95]No.
[06:26.85]Oh.
[06:27.53]Maybe that's why.
[06:29.53]Yeah, friends only.
[06:31.22]My basic details are public.
[06:33.36]That's fine.
[06:34.14]Profile friends.
[06:36.20]Do you remember one and a half hours ago when I asked if you wanted to like test anything or anything else we could do before?
[06:42.40]Well, I didn't know that this was going to be an issue.
[06:44.61]This is the first time I've opened this game in like 10 years.
[06:53.39]What if I do this?
[06:59.50]Alright, let me try that.
[07:00.42]See if that helps.
[07:04.98]That could fix it.
[07:09.59]If this doesn't work, then just join a game and I'm going to change a few options in my custom.
[07:13.91]It actually says you're playing TF2 now, which is a step up.
[07:17.15]Oh, it does.
[07:17.65]I don't think it was before.
[07:19.15]Oh, I fixed it.
[07:23.09]Do you like that we both have default medic icons?
[07:27.59]Uh.
[07:29.31]Eh.
[07:32.07]Oh, we do both have default medic icons.
[07:34.23]That's kind of funny.
[07:36.63]Great minds think alike.
[07:37.73]Yeah, they do.
[07:38.11]Okay.
[07:42.59]Okay, you joined a community server is what it's saying.
[07:45.78]What are you doing?
[07:48.32]It's the thing for the decal thing.
[07:52.78]Oh, okay.
[07:54.36]I thought, okay.
[07:55.92]Alright, we good?
[07:57.30]Yes.
[08:00.99]So you should be able to invite me now.
[08:04.03]I send you to the invite to the party and it instantly disappears and it does not show you as inviteable.
[08:10.10]It like instantly just closes.
[08:12.06]Why?
[08:15.23]why the fuck is this happening alright you invite me alright I'll be you just go down let me figure this out I don't know you invite me I know but I have to like re-enable my friends panel okay well can we talk about like sausages or something while you want what do you want to talk about
[08:33.63]Um, I don't know.
[08:34.77]Like, when do you think civilization started?
[08:37.21]I think that is a lot of things during the pyramid times and maybe even before the pyramids where there is... We already talked about this.
[08:44.58]You didn't just immediately say sauce.
[08:48.98]Oh.
[08:49.72]Has your opinion changed?
[08:52.00]Um, hold on.
[08:53.32]I can't do two things at once.
[08:54.30]Give me a little bit of slack.
[08:58.04]Hey, when you first opened TF2 after like eight years, you probably spent like a long time figuring this out.
[09:03.78]And that's why I offered to help.
[09:06.22]Yeah, but then you offered to help, but then you said I'm starting early.
[09:08.90]And you ran away and turned your stream on.
[09:11.74]And I was like, I thought he was going to help me.
[09:19.22]You did do that.
[09:19.82]You did say that.
[09:22.95]Not quite, but yeah.
[09:23.99]You did do that.
[09:24.51]You did say that.
[09:25.53]Yep.
[09:26.13]Okay.
[09:27.07]Let me just re-enable this.
[09:28.11]I don't know.
[09:33.94]so uh what is of all the new maps there's like 30 new maps right um the best map that everyone talks about is the meme map with the seal on it okay and then there's like upward and are you just playing like the old map still um I have it cue me into the new maps
[10:02.35]A mix of both.
[10:03.91]I like Phoenix.
[10:04.79]Phoenix's first point is pretty cool.
[10:13.18]Did they add anything else?
[10:14.38]I saw the cases.
[10:15.56]I opened it for a second to see.
[10:16.56]They added an official versus Saxton Hale mode, and it's actually not that bad.
[10:22.48]As someone who never really liked Saxton Hale, he has three abilities he can use, and it's a whole setup for it.
[10:30.60]Okay.
[10:31.08]Give me... I'm going to mute for a sec.
[10:33.42]Did you hear what I just said?
[10:34.42]I did.
[10:34.72]The Saxon Hill stuff.
[10:35.54]Yeah.
[10:35.78]It's cool.
[10:36.14]Okay.
[10:37.10]No, I'm listening.
[10:38.45]I'm listening, but I have to go in the command list shit.
[10:41.67]Let me see.
[10:42.15]Yeah.
[10:43.89]You answered in a very dismissive manner.
[10:47.99]What's going on with this?
[10:52.91]Oh, that's the wrong thing.
[10:58.08]Hey.
[10:58.54]Okay.
[10:58.86]I should be able to do it now.
[11:00.79]cool I got to play for 10 seconds I got two no no no no no like just just hang out like make sure it works first oh sure I shouldn't have to leave to get it hey it's been 10 years don't worry we'll do a full intro we'll do like a whole don't worry everyone can relax I'm gonna do a full intro

[11:25.59]It's going to be a bunch of fucking cool stuff happening.
[11:27.84]Just wait.
[11:28.14]Just hold on.
[11:28.70]It's been 10 years.
[11:29.46]What's up, guys?
[11:31.40]I didn't even take the splash screen down.
[11:33.80]That's just how much I haven't really... You know what I mean?
[11:36.56]It's another late night live commentary with Jerma985.
[11:45.72]Tonight, I'm going to be playing as a scout.

[12:09.41]Can I do that?
[12:09.83]Can you do that?
[12:17.04]You did it.
[12:17.74]I'm in.
[12:18.00]Okay, I'm gonna exit this game.
[12:22.64]Okay.
[12:24.86]I am going to queue us for, you want to see the new maps?
[12:27.35]Yes.
[12:27.59]How does this work?
[12:37.85]Do you want me to queue for Saxton Hale as well?
[12:41.05]I would like for you to queue us for... It is the new content.
[12:46.73]Anything... Well, I want to just play Team Fortress for now.
[12:50.15]You know what I mean?
[12:51.59]Okay.
[12:51.69]I just want to play TF2.
[12:52.41]See, that's what happens.
[12:54.25]It's like, cool, there's 14 new maps and then you join TF2 and you're like, I'm going to play the new maps.
[12:57.75]And then you're like, where's the health kit?
[12:59.15]Where's the health kit?
[13:00.06]Where are they spawning?
[13:01.18]And you just run around into walls and it's like, this isn't Team Fortress.
[13:04.18]I'm confused.
[13:05.18]Especially if you're like first games.
[13:09.59]This is fucking cool.
[13:13.64]Alright, so, first of all, let's go over what's going on today.
[13:17.82]Today, it's only been, like, we haven't been sitting here for, like, 12 minutes.
[13:20.76]11 minutes, sorry.
[13:26.25]Yeah.
[13:27.59]This is Team Fortress 2.
[13:30.32]Honestly, we have to do this because it's probably like... No, shut up.
[13:34.79]Listen to me.
[13:35.31]No, you're right.
[13:36.11]I'm laughing because I'm like, wait.
[13:38.87]Do you know how many people probably don't play this?
[13:40.35]What if this game's older than the people watching?
[13:44.59]There's probably a lot of people here that have no idea what's even going on.
[13:49.63]we have to give a brief explanation of what Team Fortress is while you explain it can you put like uh subway surfers on the side no hold on I'm gonna show the game uh if you're good you'll get a facecam by the way you have to be you guys gotta be good are you ready are we am I joining this are we good we're good we're joining this are you so ready

[14:20.58]I didn't know this map was Saxton.
[14:21.54]Oh, it's versus Saxton Hill.
[14:23.88]Well, this will be a good reminder.
[14:25.20]I don't... No, I don't want to play this.

[14:34.00]I left.
[14:34.42]You already started complaining and the map didn't even load yet.
[14:39.21]Okay, trust me.
[14:40.13]Alright, so do it again.
[14:43.73]I'm going to put you on a real map.
[14:45.05]We're going to do a real map that you're aware of.
[14:47.27]Okay, I loaded the game for like maybe 20 minutes.
[14:52.86]And it was just to buy keys.
[14:54.78]Okay?
[14:56.46]That's what I did.
[14:58.08]How many did you buy?
[15:00.30]Two or three hundred.
[15:02.94]Why?
[15:04.12]I made that up.
[15:04.88]I bought like 15.
[15:08.06]I don't like being lied to as a joke.
[15:10.76]I don't respect that.
[15:13.62]Whatever happened to honesty?
[15:14.86]Everyone's always like, I bought like 15.
[15:16.84]I got 15.
[15:20.40]Okay.
[15:21.25]I don't know.
[15:21.71]I just like, I have so many crates in my inventory.
[15:24.47]They don't even know what they are for.
[15:25.71]They might be like rare.
[15:28.47]Do you know this map?
[15:30.31]I mean, I know I have the fucking pyro, uh, pyro.
[15:34.61]Why is this on?
[15:36.75]Oh, you're a spy.
[15:37.50]I can't heal you.
[15:39.60]Good luck.
[15:40.80]Alright, so this is... Wait, this is different.
[15:43.66]Oh, this HUD looks cool.
[15:45.08]I actually like this HUD.
[15:50.07]I should customize it a little bit more.
[15:53.25]Okay, so how do I... Okay, I have a gas can on.
[15:56.01]Wait, what's my menu?
[15:58.26]I don't want that.
[15:59.30]I want to.
[15:59.90]I don't know what's good nowadays, like the flare gun still.
[16:05.26]Well, you're not in spawn, so it doesn't matter.
[16:06.92]Sorry, whatever.
[16:07.94]I'll go back.
[16:10.58]Change your view model.
[16:13.62]Is my view model too big?
[16:15.46]People have been telling me that.
[16:18.10]For.
[16:20.60]Like a week.
[16:21.80]Yeah.
[16:25.95]They don't know the real TF2.
[16:28.99]what people want them the small view models they make me want to throw up they make me upset as a boomer I'm upset maybe uh the small ones you mean view model underscore fov oh I hate that too when you can see their arms I'm a purist okay it's going pretty good so far I would say oh
[17:04.18]I'll keep it for now.
[17:04.88]Maybe I'll see how I like it.
[17:06.20]Alright.
[17:07.34]Do I want to play Pyro?
[17:08.10]What do I want to do?
[17:09.89]What do you want to do?
[17:10.85]I don't know.
[17:12.77]What was your favorite Team Fortress 2 class in the original Team Fortress 2 that we're playing right now live on stream?
[17:18.65]It was the Spy.
[17:19.15]The Spy, for sure.
[17:20.69]Really?
[17:21.67]I'll do Quick-Fix, Ubersauce.
[17:23.20]This looks good.
[17:29.75]Oh, there's a moment.
[17:31.53]Hey, by the way, Ster just want to make sure I let you know where are you?
[17:36.99]On the.
[17:40.33]I'm dead.
[17:41.23]Alright, well, I gotta.
[17:43.71]I got a Quick-Fix for you when you get up.
[17:47.77]Are we doing that?
[17:49.24]I mean, I'm I'm just healing because we need it.
[17:50.96]If you just said your favorite class was with spy, why would I play as a spy?
[17:56.56]I'm a team player.
[17:59.35]A spy is a team player, but we needed another medical.
[18:02.54]OK, I'll come find you.
[18:07.24]My God.
[18:07.64]I'm going to activate over.
[18:19.11]I love the quick fixes Uber.
[18:21.11]Is that is it bad?
[18:25.06]Uh... I mean, it's... It's... It's... Why are you so scared of, like, what's considered good and bad?
[18:31.50]That's a spy.
[18:31.78]Why can't you just, like, enjoy yourself?
[18:33.77]I am enjoying myself.
[18:34.69]And by the way, I gotta let you know something, Star.
[18:37.49]It's over!
[18:39.21]Oh.
[18:40.53]Oh, no.
[18:40.99]It's... It's over.
[18:43.89]Did you get the laugh track stuff?
[18:46.57]Uh... No.
[18:49.21]Oh.
[18:49.95]Okay, well, never mind.
[18:51.86]I tried.
[18:54.82]I thought you were going to have like a whole soundboard of like booze and cheers and laugh track.
[18:59.46]I forgot that was the bit.
[19:01.14]I knew that.
[19:02.36]Oh.
[19:02.96]Heal me.
[19:04.28]Behind you.
[19:04.82]Not that soldier.
[19:05.74]Pick up the health kit.
[19:06.88]I'm working on it.
[19:08.38]Do this.
[19:08.76]Do that.
[19:11.13]Do what I say.
[19:12.25]I don't have the crits, by the way.
[19:13.31]If I get backstabbed, it's your fault.
[19:15.09]I know.
[19:15.83]Well, also, you're the medic.
[19:17.23]It's easier for you to look around, but okay.
[19:19.21]No, it's not because my beam will get detached.
[19:21.19]What the fuck?
[19:26.51]What?
[19:26.85]Oh, that's right.
[19:27.47]I move with you because I have the Quick-Fix.
[19:29.79]Oh, that's cool.
[19:31.62]Jerma versus Star.
[19:32.44]Jerma versus Star.
[19:33.44]Everybody wants to see this happen.
[19:36.44]This is the reunion episode, guys.
[19:41.42]This stream is going to have like a four on fucking IMDB.
[19:45.38]Oh, God damn it.
[19:46.06]I'm dead.
[19:46.84]This stream is going to have like a four on IMDB because it's a reunion episode.
[19:50.08]And we're just going to say the jokes we've always said for like 14 years.
[19:54.28]And it's just going to be flashbacks.
[19:56.10]and my hair is all gray and shit like it's and by the way it's been like eight years since we've even been on camera so I just want to make sure everyone's aware of that and I lost oh let me get crits actually Jerma the crits the crits wait you want me to scream for the crit yeah let's go come on hey come on we're back
[20:22.57]And then after I say that, it cuts.
[20:25.22]Like, this is part of the video.
[20:26.54]It cuts to, like, total playtime in the next six months to, like, four hours and ten minutes, which is this stream.
[20:33.30]Yeah, because you're not a real player.
[20:35.24]You're a Frank.
[20:37.94]Do you know it's in lore now that Mac is the soldier's sister?
[20:42.80]You just die.
[20:43.62]I did.
[20:44.30]I got hit right in the face.
[20:47.32]Oh, dude, we're so back.
[20:54.13]I do want to make the HUD a little different.
[20:58.08]You can customize the whole thing, right?
[20:59.94]This does look better than the default HUD in a way.
[21:03.14]I always use the default HUD just because of... I don't know.
[21:07.58]I always felt like a custom HUD crashed the game all the time.
[21:10.57]But I guess it's been a long time.
[21:15.27]What game were you playing?
[21:16.29]I don't know, but you're doing pretty good.
[21:19.59]You know what to do, by the way.
[21:22.48]Oh, you're healing me?
[21:23.78]Oh, okay, so Team Fortress 2 is a team-based shooter.
[21:28.93]There's a red team and a blue team.
[21:30.03]You're probably looking at this and going like, what the heck's going on here?
[21:33.17]So the cart, that blue cart, is the objective for the blue team.
[21:37.89]It is our job to stop them from pushing that object.
[21:40.89]Hashtag ad.
[21:44.38]Alright, you know what?
[21:45.10]Hey, you know what you have to do.
[21:48.48]uh well let's does this still work I haven't had like a medic where I like build uber for you by damaging myself okay let's go okay you let me know when you're oh scout scout scout scout still up scout still alive oh that's how you tell we're back that's how you can tell we're back that's how you know we're back
[22:20.17]behind spy oh no sorry I'm a liar I lied liar liar I don't want to pocket you why not because that's how a team loses you don't have to also that's the opposite of true is it I always want to make sure the other medic is overhealed and what's over here I mean that's true
[22:50.62]That spy has like 600 health.
[22:53.38]Doesn't make any sense.
[22:53.96]Kunai.
[22:55.80]Oh.
[22:56.20]He could have had Kunai health.
[22:59.08]People saying, whoa, shitty aim, shitty aim.
[23:01.42]Hold on.
[23:03.00]But a lot of people don't even know how this game works.
[23:04.86]Alright.
[23:05.22]Almost everything in this game is a projectile.
[23:06.88]This character that he's playing is Mercy from Overwatch.
[23:09.78]This game kind of just ripped it off.
[23:11.08]You don't like really have to aim.
[23:12.74]You just like kind of like put your beam on someone and then you say, heroes never die.
[23:17.39]No, you don't say that because this is Team Fortress.
[23:21.43]But see, there's an arc, and it's all a projectile in the server.
[23:25.93]And look at how long it takes for it to go ahead and travel.
[23:28.09]See what I mean?
[23:28.95]Everything's a projectile.
[23:29.95]Skill shots.
[23:32.21]Yeah, this game is skill shots only.
[23:37.78]Oh, hi.
[23:38.44]Nice.
[23:46.60]Yeah, this feels like the game that we played for a very long time.
[23:52.11]And remember, fake hair everywhere.
[23:54.79]That's a classic line.
[23:56.17]What are the classic lines if we had not said?
[23:58.05]Is this a spy?
[24:02.22]He's bored already.
[24:04.36]Wow, this is really like, oh, this is a game I played for years.
[24:07.38]You guys have heard of this game, Viewfinder?
[24:10.30]Viewfinder?
[24:13.04]Yeah, we might have to take a rain check on that game.
[24:15.66]What?
[24:15.86]Because I feel like I'm going to play this a lot.
[24:17.34]This is fun.
[24:19.94]Uh-oh, he saw that.
[24:23.14]Alright, where you at?
[24:25.29]Okay.
[24:26.39]Okay, if you don't get at least seven kills with this crit, you need to do ten push-ups.
[24:36.42]Well, I didn't get any with it.
[24:38.86]Well, you got to do ten push-ups, bro.
[24:45.38]I feel like that's on you to do the push-ups.
[24:47.23]What?
[24:47.45]No.
[24:47.75]I didn't need the crits.
[24:51.91]Oh, my God.
[24:52.75]You killed, like, four people.
[24:54.49]I got a random one.
[24:55.37]I got two of it.
[25:02.08]How about I do push-ups, but you, like, lay under me?
[25:12.29]Does that even work?
[25:14.74]What are you talking about?
[25:17.42]You know me.
[25:18.00]Wait, wait.
[25:18.68]What?
[25:19.10]Okay.
[25:19.84]I work out.
[25:20.72]Wait, wait, wait.
[25:21.20]I don't want to die.
[25:22.06]I don't want to die.
[25:22.58]I'm going to kill this heavy.
[25:24.30]The way you know if you go down to maximum depth on a push-up is if you kiss.
[25:29.09]Okay.
[25:30.21]Whatever you're saying, I just got... I have a full Uber right now.
[25:33.71]Where are you?
[25:34.77]I'm dead.
[25:35.53]Well, get back alive.
[25:37.58]I'm getting back alive.
[25:38.50]I'm coming through a teleport.
[25:39.42]I have to crit a sniper.
[25:40.71]This is bad.
[25:41.27]This is bad.
[25:41.95]Don't do it.
[25:42.29]I'm behind you.
[25:42.67]I'm behind you.
[25:42.97]I'm behind you.
[25:43.35]I'm behind you.
[25:43.73]It's me.
[25:44.09]Let me know.
[25:51.01]Yeah.
[25:51.75]You know the signal.
[25:56.30]Good.
[25:57.10]There's one.
[26:01.52]It's two.
[26:01.94]Nice.
[26:03.34]Almost.
[26:03.52]Almost.
[26:06.75]Hey, we did it.
[26:07.83]There was no one else to kill.
[26:16.16]I thought that was a burp.
[26:20.22]I was convinced you burped.
[26:21.96]Maybe.
[26:22.72]You should play Spy.
[26:23.46]You like Spy.
[26:24.70]It's going to be so embarrassing.
[26:26.68]No, there's like three Spy.
[26:27.79]I'll play Engineer.
[26:28.91]Do a stair stab.
[26:30.47]I'm going to play Engineer for one specific reason.
[26:32.79]And I don't know if you're going to be very upset with me or if you're going to be very happy.
[26:37.23]What's the reason?
[26:38.05]You'll see.
[26:39.25]Yeah, I have to wait one full minute, though.
[26:44.10]Why?
[26:45.16]You just... You have to wait a minute.
[26:50.44]How's the audio?
[26:51.00]Is the volume good?
[26:52.08]Does it need to be a little bit louder?
[26:59.44]A little quiet?
[27:02.28]Let me...
[27:07.21]Oh, shit.
[27:07.49]I didn't want to do that.
[27:11.11]Wait.
[27:11.69]Oops.
[27:12.23]Okay.
[27:13.15]Options.
[27:14.63]Audio.
[27:15.85]That's neat.
[27:16.65]I remember your old hat loadouts.
[27:19.73]You're playing the self portrait engineer.
[27:22.16]Yeah.
[27:26.94]Oh, shit.
[27:27.16]You can't see.
[27:28.30]Alright, so this is why I wanted you to... You're either going to be very mad or very happy.
[27:32.84]We'll find out really shortly here.
[27:34.72]Oh no, wrong one.
[27:36.62]Oh my god.
[27:37.24]No, no, no, wrong one.
[27:38.34]No, no, no, wrong one.
[27:39.68]Wrong, wrong, wrong.
[27:41.42]This one's important.
[27:49.36]Alright, Hank Hill.
[27:54.90]Best of luck to you.
[27:58.91]I love this so much.
[28:03.92]You can get backstabbed on the go-kart?
[28:07.20]Why not?
[28:08.90]You have a back.
[28:10.48]Oh, it should hit the fucking metal.
[28:14.48]You know what?
[28:15.17]I'm changing class.
[28:15.97]I got a better idea.
[28:16.85]I don't want to play engineer.
[28:18.71]I want to play fucking heavy.
[28:19.59]Okay.
[28:22.19]Alright.
[28:23.23]I thought we were going to be engineer friends.
[28:28.75]Okay.
[28:33.44]Where are you?
[28:35.50]I was building a sentry.
[28:37.66]I saw you.
[28:39.24]Oh, you saw it already.
[28:41.18]I get that you bought every single drivable.
[28:44.61]I can shoot the gun?
[28:45.57]Yeah.
[28:47.29]What?
[28:50.13]It only has five bullets.
[28:53.31]You just wasted them.
[28:57.56]Does this actually hurt people?
[29:02.64]I don't know, actually.
[29:04.88]It has to, right?
[29:09.45]It doesn't have to.
[29:10.43]Spy!
[29:11.35]Spy!
[29:15.67]Watch your back.
[29:17.55]He's right here.
[29:20.51]Yeah, fuck you, buddy.
[29:24.57]That didn't do anything.
[29:32.55]How do I do that?
[29:38.19]It was inevitable.
[29:39.11]Alright, let's go.
[29:42.24]Let's go.
[29:42.72]Let's go.
[29:48.84]Gotta go push that cart.
[29:49.88]I would.
[29:50.78]We could have run for a second.
[29:51.64]Hold on.
[29:52.84]There's a lot of things going on.
[29:55.55]Gotta push that gear up.
[30:00.39]I heard steps.
[30:05.35]I'm doing it.
[30:06.10]I'm really doing it.
[30:07.04]They have a bad ahead of soldier with a conch or whatever it is.
[30:12.14]A soldier with a Brass Beast.
[30:13.92]Excuse me.
[30:16.86]The conch, the conch, whatever it is.
[30:19.99]Soldier with the what?
[30:21.37]The conch, the shell, the like.
[30:24.17]Soldier with the.
[30:26.45]What are you talking about?
[30:29.15]What?
[30:29.75]Let me actually take this off.
[30:32.33]I do have some cool items.
[30:34.07]I love the Thomas Love.
[30:35.07]It was awesome.
[30:35.55]Banana?
[30:42.70]Yeah, for those of you that don't know, Team Fortress 2 has like 5,000 items that are different and can't change the gameplay.
[30:49.08]They are all different now.
[30:50.52]Every one that you remember that was fun is different now.
[30:53.43]Really?
[30:54.63]Yes.
[30:55.91]So much stuff changed, actually.
[30:57.45]Oh my god.
[30:58.85]Wait, is this 40%?
[30:59.99]I might have to take a whole stream just sitting here looking at every item.
[31:04.17]That might have to happen later.
[31:06.09]Tell me which one you put on and I'll tell you if it was different.
[31:09.02]Okay, Gloves of Running Urgently.
[31:11.65]I think those are still the same.
[31:13.23]Are they the same?
[31:14.45]I haven't actually played like no heavy.
[31:15.95]Don't ask me about any heavy items.
[31:17.43]Never mind.
[31:18.25]Is this live?
[31:18.81]Yeah, it's live.
[31:20.97]It's late night live.
[31:21.85]This is late night live commentary.
[31:24.62]My hit series.
[31:25.74]What are you doing?
[31:33.04]What are you doing?
[31:34.82]Yeah, the Tommy's love is much quicker.
[31:36.43]Alright, let's actually I'm going.
[31:37.27]I'm going for it now.
[31:37.89]I'm going for it.
[31:38.33]No more fucking around.
[31:38.91]No more shit.
[31:42.63]Man, I picked the only time that our team was not pushing.
[31:49.95]What do we actually need?
[31:51.37]What should we need?
[31:54.29]Maybe demo?
[31:56.01]Yeah.
[31:56.99]What's my demo?
[31:57.77]I'm sorry.
[31:58.25]I'm just all over the place.
[31:59.61]It's overwhelming.
[32:00.27]I forget everything.
[32:03.10]Loose Cannon was cool.
[32:04.18]Is that different?
[32:06.72]Uh, no.
[32:08.95]keep alright I'm gonna do Loose Cannon what about the shield are the shields any better or different or anything uh Tide Turner makes you go anywhere this one's just defense alright I'm gonna just do defense and um the the donk whatever it is bonk whatever it is oh what the uh all my stuff's getting sapped bro oh
[32:36.89]Heliport are down.
[32:37.85]It all went to shit.
[32:40.06]That's alright.
[32:41.08]I'm playing one of my favorite items in the game.
[32:42.74]Everything is about to change for our in our favor.
[32:52.61]The game behind us.
[32:55.49]I'm aware I must kill this guy.
[33:02.49]I give up.
[33:04.10]Don't give up.
[33:05.27]I give up on engineer.
[33:07.81]I'm going to go back to spawn and get in the little car.
[33:12.33]Oh my God.
[33:16.87]Never back down.
[33:17.67]Yeah, never back down.
[33:22.34]So the Loose Cannon is.
[33:26.16]You have to hit them twice.
[33:27.50]Once with the direct hit and then once with the explosion, right?
[33:29.46]That's how I remember.
[33:31.80]If you charge it up all the way, you blow yourself up.
[33:33.64]Don't do that.
[33:34.22]People are going to do Omega Lulls.
[33:35.91]I mean, they're definitely Omega Lulling the whole time since I opened the game.
[33:40.89]That's fine.
[33:43.15]I'm glad they're having a good time.
[33:46.31]Ooh!
[33:47.51]Ooh!
[33:53.74]Omega Lulls.
[33:56.30]I do have a hit sound, I guess.
[34:00.51]You have a hit sound?
[34:01.21]Yeah.
[34:03.11]You didn't even ask me for like a hit sound?
[34:06.51]No, dude, I installed a custom HUD for the first time forever.
[34:10.81]We would have sat there for like three hours while you tried to explain.
[34:13.25]It's one folder in one spot.
[34:16.99]Oh.
[34:17.27]It's not too late, Jerma.
[34:18.83]I can give you a hit sound.
[34:19.91]You're going to love it.
[34:20.71]See if I can get this done.
[34:23.57]Oh, I can't take this thing down.
[34:25.17]Wait, why can I sheath this?
[34:26.27]I thought I couldn't.
[34:35.69]Oh!
[34:41.81]Let's go.
[34:51.76]That was a good crits too.
[34:52.74]That was like almost everybody.
[34:55.74]There's five proud of you.
[34:56.56]Now we're so back.
[35:00.80]We're so back.
[35:03.68]Oh, I'm having I'm having fun.
[35:06.40]Oh, I'm not.
[35:08.40]Are you not having fun?
[35:09.62]I am having fun.
[35:10.92]I just find it funny that.
[35:14.42]I'm having fun is code word for what's next.
[35:18.88]Get over here.
[35:19.30]So it's funny to say.
[35:25.30]I mean, I've been playing this for like a week.
[35:28.36]Hold on.
[35:36.22]Oh shit, I'm good.
[35:41.71]Alright, so if you don't know what's going on there, that weapon.
[35:46.30]Dude, there's a lot of people here.
[35:48.52]This game is like our entire... You and I... Can you explain what a shpee is?
[35:54.41]You and I, our entire lives are because this game exists.
[35:59.25]You understand?
[36:00.49]We need to make sure people understand this.
[36:01.75]Okay.
[36:04.16]So this thing, when you get a kill with it, you get healed.
[36:09.04]You get healed 50% of your health.
[36:11.62]What?
[36:13.44]What?
[36:14.78]I'm sorry.
[36:16.07]That has nothing to do with you.
[36:18.47]So, but if I take this out and I don't kill someone, this is completely different.
[36:22.55]I don't even understand how this item works anymore.
[36:24.97]Which item?
[36:25.81]Zatoichi.
[36:28.30]You can't put it away.
[36:29.76]No, you... No, no, no.
[36:30.26]It's different.
[36:30.80]It's different.
[36:34.94]No, okay, so you get 50% base health if you kill somebody.
[36:38.47]There are no random crits.
[36:40.17]And once you draw this thing, if you put it away, you get hurt for 50 damage.
[36:45.21]Unless you kill somebody.
[36:45.97]Oh.
[36:46.97]Okay, that's interesting.
[36:47.99]Yeah, most things have changed.
[36:50.23]I actually like that better.
[36:51.13]Hold on, let me see.
[36:53.83]Oh, wow.
[36:57.83]Oh, shit.
[36:58.33]Maybe that's why I was getting hurt.
[36:59.35]I didn't even know that was happening.
[37:00.69]Were you just weapon swapping it?
[37:02.33]I think so, yeah.
[37:12.09]Dude, I've got my contract going.
[37:15.55]Or get five kills as a demo in a single life?
[37:18.35]Press F2.
[37:20.55]Why?
[37:20.95]If you want to hack, I just want you to see this menu.
[37:25.43]Okay.
[37:26.19]F2.
[37:26.81]Hold on.
[37:27.38]I'll do it when I'm dead.
[37:29.30]This is the Deus Ex fucking hack screen.
[37:31.76]Oh, God.
[37:40.43]What the fuck?
[37:41.43]How is he still alive?
[37:43.81]What does a crit do with the melee?
[37:45.41]Don't say swears.
[37:48.03]Alright, you want to press F2?
[37:49.03]Yeah.
[37:50.33]Does this open up the contract menu?
[37:52.15]Yeah.
[37:52.79]Okay.
[37:54.45]Yeah, I mean, I did a lot of this when it was relevant like 10 years ago.
[37:58.89]It didn't exist 10 years ago.
[38:00.59]How long?
[38:00.93]Yeah, this is like five years ago, eight years.
[38:03.14]It was a long time ago.
[38:05.40]They changed it to that during the Jungle Inferno update like two years ago.
[38:10.37]I must have played for like an hour.
[38:11.97]Oh, yeah, I never saw that before.
[38:15.62]Did I play?
[38:16.86]Maybe I did.
[38:17.92]When was Jungle Inferno, guys?
[38:19.42]It was not five years ago.
[38:20.74]It was two years ago.
[38:24.40]There's been so many updates to this game, it's hard to keep track.
[38:27.56]He was playing off stream.
[38:31.62]Did I play this game for a little bit like two or three years ago?
[38:34.97]I must have.
[38:37.11]No, I did.
[38:37.83]I did.
[38:38.11]I did very briefly.
[38:40.48]Or like maybe a day or two.
[38:42.06]But I immediately dropped it because it was just kind of fucking all fucked up.
[38:46.74]Jungle Inferno was 2017.
[38:48.09]Yeah, that was two years ago.
[38:49.99]That's not two years ago.
[38:51.27]That was two.
[38:52.39]2017?
[38:53.05]Yeah, it sounds like two years.
[38:56.47]That's a long time ago.
[38:57.70]It's like 2018 now.
[38:58.98]Somebody said, hey dude, is your mouse on gravel?
[39:07.40]What do you... You mean like a mouse pad of rocks?
[39:15.77]Maybe my sensitivity is too high.
[39:24.77]Pyro's exist.
[39:25.87]It feels okay.
[39:30.57]Bye, behind.
[39:32.73]Dude, he just fucked everybody up.
[39:35.39]I made the call out too.
[39:38.78]And they didn't hear you.
[39:39.64]Oh, I'm in trouble.
[39:48.71]I'm getting ready to use the shwicky swag.
[39:51.93]I'm not doing bad.
[39:53.73]I got 53 points.
[39:54.69]That's like doing pretty good.
[39:59.20]Alright, let's do engineer.
[40:01.02]Engineer with the mini sentry.
[40:03.94]Yeah, oh yeah.
[40:05.04]Let's go.
[40:07.71]Okay, I want to do this.
[40:11.27]Get a teleporter.
[40:12.65]Yep.
[40:14.07]Teleporter.
[40:15.15]Teleporter.
[40:15.63]Going up.
[40:17.65]Do not get backstabbed.
[40:19.62]What if I want to?
[40:28.02]Help.
[40:28.94]Help.
[40:29.84]Help.
[40:30.12]I'm on fire.
[40:30.58]I need a dispenser.
[40:31.60]Help.
[40:32.38]Help.
[40:33.26]Put a dispenser.
[40:34.46]Get out of the way.
[40:35.59]Get out of the way.
[40:43.48]Wait, is it you?
[40:44.52]Oh, I think I was being.
[40:46.52]I was the sniper.
[40:48.62]Asking for help.
[40:52.12]Help level this dispenser up.
[40:54.79]I only have 55 mana.
[41:00.09]Where's the ammo on this map?
[41:03.81]This guy thinks he's playing World of Warcraft.
[41:12.20]Look at this.
[41:12.60]We have like a little nest over here.
[41:14.32]Perfect.
[41:17.78]Lay down the rug.
[41:21.88]Always help.
[41:22.58]Always help your fellow engineer.
[41:24.62]Everyone's just going to be over there helping you.
[41:26.24]There is no one else playing the game right now.
[41:29.36]Oh my God.
[41:36.16]Oh, I got two kills with this thing.
[41:37.14]Holy shit.
[41:37.54]That means I get crits with it.
[41:38.84]The only thing I care about when playing as Engineer is the Frontier Justice.
[41:44.00]Oh, oh, oh.
[41:45.20]Spy is gone.
[41:45.58]He's probably going to try to telefrag somebody.
[41:49.19]I killed him.
[41:50.27]Killed him.
[41:52.01]But he got one of the teleporters.
[41:56.93]Alright, now this is where I go and fuck somebody up.
[42:11.33]Alright, I'm happy with it.
[42:19.14]I'm happy with it.
[42:19.64]Is this all the way?
[42:24.47]It is all the way.
[42:25.01]Alright, we're all good.
[42:32.45]No one's going to be fucking around over here.
[42:35.71]Are you sure about that?
[42:38.48]I don't know.
[42:39.02]Oh, bye.
[42:40.71]He's at spawn.
[42:44.23]My own shit got in the way.
[42:45.63]God damn it.
[42:47.89]Yeah, it's going to be hard keeping that up.
[42:50.23]He's dedicated to his craft.
[42:56.63]It's alright.
[42:57.26]Alright.
[42:57.68]That's fine.
[42:59.08]Let's go, bud.
[43:09.26]was that you what the velociraptor in the call oh uh spy spy's coming for you next spy's coming for next back at spawn no but the dispensers did they all get destroyed uh my dispensers there
[43:32.85]I'm trying to get the teleporter back up.
[43:36.25]Somebody's at the dispenser right now.
[43:37.78]Let me telefrag him.
[43:42.58]We're trying.
[43:49.44]Oh, fuck.
[43:49.88]This is bad.
[43:57.62]We gotta get this thing to level 3.
[43:59.24]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quickly, quickly, quickly.
[44:07.92]I'm just trying to have a decoy.
[44:09.62]Yeah.
[44:09.98]Good.
[44:10.24]Good.
[44:10.74]Exactly what I wanted.
[44:14.21]Exactly what I wanted.
[44:15.07]They killed the mini sentry like three times.
[44:18.87]They didn't even go for the big one.
[44:22.85]Those fools.
[44:25.85]Change your hit sound?
[44:26.69]My hit sound is like a squishy sound.
[44:33.55]Change it.
[44:34.81]Change your hit sound.
[44:35.53]Change your view model.
[44:37.19]Change your sensitivity.
[44:39.09]Change your loadout.
[44:39.83]Equip the pen.
[44:43.69]Jerma, equip the pen.
[44:45.01]Oh, did you say pan?
[44:46.11]Equip the pen.
[44:47.91]You're talking about the pan, like the pen.
[44:50.31]Why do you keep saying pen?
[44:53.34]Equip the pen.
[44:54.00]I like just being annoying with the pistol.
[45:15.61]Oh shit, sorry, he's gonna die.
[45:20.43]What is the?
[45:21.01]Why do you keep saying that?
[45:21.67]What is that?
[45:22.35]What's the pen?
[45:27.41]That's that's it.
[45:28.49]There's really not much more to it.
[45:31.43]Come on, we can do it.
[45:35.66]Overtime.
[45:35.98]Alright, get in there, get in there.
[45:38.82]Get in there.
[45:41.54]This last point's really hard because there's always a million sentries at a perfect angle.
[45:49.51]Wait, no.
[45:50.77]We're just losers!
[45:52.23]Losers!
[45:53.15]That spy has 83 points and he's playing with a trackpad.
[45:56.71]He's lying.
[45:57.19]You sure?
[45:58.75]Yeah, I'm sure.
[45:59.21]Where do you want to go?
[46:00.61]This is where you leave.
[46:01.33]This is where you leave?
[46:03.43]Yeah, this is where you 100% leave the game.
[46:05.68]Okay.
[46:06.18]Because nobody is going to stay.
[46:07.76]And I told you this and we discussed this.
[46:10.14]Okay.
[46:11.32]Do you want the new maps now?
[46:12.46]I'll put some of the good or new maps on.
[46:15.52]Let me look at medic.
[46:24.94]They add, okay, the Vaccinator.
[46:27.81]This one was weird at the very get-go.
[46:29.95]I wonder if they changed it.
[46:32.93]I don't think so, and it is still weird.
[46:35.61]A crazy uber charge rate.
[46:39.47]You press your reload key to cycle through resist types.
[46:43.92]While healing provides you and your target with a constant 10% resistance to the selected damage type,
[46:51.33]The Uber Charge provides a 2.5 second resistance bubble that blocks 75% base damage and 100% crit damage.
[46:58.39]It's like we're playing D4.
[46:59.79]It's a Diablo 4 item.
[47:02.68]What does this item do?
[47:04.50]Okay.
[47:08.16]Minus 66% overheal.
[47:10.20]Whatever.
[47:12.35]You have to switch it between things so it requires more buttons.
[47:18.40]So like when a pyro is coming, you have to switch it to fire resistance.
[47:25.52]I wonder, was that any better than the Quick-Fix?
[47:32.02]Um, situationally.
[47:34.50]Maybe to like anti-crits if you know somebody has a crit screen, but why wouldn't you just use the uber?
[47:37.94]I guess it's faster.
[47:39.20]Uh, crit would probably kill someone with a Vaccinator.
[47:42.05]No, it's 100%.
[47:45.32]When you Uber, you block 100% crit damage of the selected type.
[47:51.54]That part might be new then.
[47:53.04]It might be new.
[47:57.64]Vaccinator is OP if you get good with it.
[48:01.62]It is very strong.
[48:02.58]Like if a Pyro is walking in and you switch to fire damage, they just start doing like one every hit.
[48:09.12]You just out-heal any damage they can do.
[48:11.38]Well, I missed the entire Uber build period, so that's bad.
[48:17.86]Who needs it?
[48:19.08]Oh, this is nice.
[48:19.76]This map is cool.
[48:20.76]Oh, I like this a lot.
[48:21.46]It's like water.
[48:26.34]Spy.
[48:26.62]God damn it.
[48:31.03]I chased a fucking spy.
[48:32.87]It's great to hear you having the takes that I also had a week ago and how quickly they've changed.
[48:39.11]Really?
[48:39.53]So you don't like this?
[48:42.65]This map is cursed.
[48:44.47]This map is not one that you want to play on, even though you had the same reaction.
[48:47.59]I do want to play on it.
[48:49.34]I want you to experience it.
[48:52.10]Everything bad that could possibly happen to you is going to happen because this map is haunted.
[48:57.77]What?
[48:59.28]There's ghosts on this map, dude.
[49:01.02]Wait, you mean that?
[49:03.38]Or is it like you're just fucking around?
[49:04.74]Like in the program, ghosts.
[49:06.40]Not like, oh, I'm going to see a cute little ghost.
[49:08.30]No, like in the program, someone died on this map while making it and there's ghosts on this map and it's haunted.
[49:14.45]Wait, what?
[49:16.01]You'll see.
[49:18.81]By the end of this map, you're going to be like, no, I get what he meant.
[49:21.54]I don't, I don't, I have no idea what that means, but I... You know how you go into like a haunted house and like all the spooky stuff starts happening and things start going badly for you?
[49:28.40]Mm-hmm.
[49:29.12]Spy demo.
[49:30.24]That's Venice.
[49:33.14]Venice is haunted.
[49:34.58]Oh, okay.
[49:35.34]That's spy too.
[49:36.02]Who knows?
[49:40.09]What?
[49:40.95]Somebody in the chat just write their type in all caps.
[49:43.49]Get your fucking beam on that heavy.
[49:49.42]Oh, that was bad.
[49:50.38]That was a bad crack, but it's OK.
[49:55.08]You know, don't say swears.
[49:56.44]We don't have very many hour classes, do we?
[50:00.36]There's one demo.
[50:04.58]I'm seeing a lot of spies, a lot of snipers.
[50:08.62]Uh.
[50:13.54]What do you want us to?
[50:14.98]Oh no, no, no, no.
[50:18.51]I don't... This... It's three pyros, two scouts.
[50:22.83]Hey.
[50:24.01]Are things not going well right now?
[50:25.93]Is that what you're suggesting?
[50:28.28]Not necessarily.
[50:32.26]Yeah, I used Cow Mangler.
[50:33.38]There it is, the conk.
[50:35.84]The what?
[50:36.48]The conqueror.
[50:37.46]I don't even know how to fucking be a good teammate.
[50:42.43]I'll show you.
[50:48.55]Especially to the engineers with the holding shit.
[50:50.17]I don't know where we're going.
[50:59.68]Into the haunted mansion.
[51:03.84]Am I going away from the... Wait.
[51:07.22]I think I'm fucking... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[51:10.90]Wrong way, wrong way.
[51:11.65]What's he doing?
[51:12.21]What's he doing?
[51:12.81]Get that fucking beam on that heavy.
[51:18.54]It's a big map.
[51:26.59]Who thought Spy was a good idea?
[51:27.89]This map's haunted.
[51:29.85]No, this map is haunted.
[51:30.87]Are you just not very good?
[51:39.77]Do you think ghosts are real?
[51:40.65]That's a whole can of worms.
[51:43.97]answer them.
[51:45.49]I mean, not necessarily.
[51:47.41]I think there's a possibility there could be some phantoms.
[51:51.33]I feel like that was a yes or no question and you cannot answer it with not necessarily.
[52:00.26]Oh my God.
[52:00.84]Oh, how did I miss everybody?
[52:02.34]Did it hit the wall?
[52:03.04]There it is.
[52:08.50]What dude?
[52:09.64]I got the conqueror.
[52:10.26]I got the conqueror.
[52:10.78]I got the conqueror.
[52:11.32]I got the conqueror.
[52:13.15]You got the what?
[52:14.08]I have to stop doing that.
[52:15.62]It's not even funny.
[52:16.46]Alright, let's go.
[52:18.06]Where are you?
[52:18.48]What does he have?
[52:19.28]Is it in his hand right now?
[52:20.64]I knew that was a spy too.
[52:22.22]Stop muting and censoring my words.
[52:25.34]You're about to put your lips on it?
[52:29.68]He's fucking with me.
[52:30.46]He's messing up my video game.
[52:38.93]Was I messing with you?
[52:40.09]They're ghost real!
[52:42.32]They might, I don't know.
[52:43.40]How are we supposed to know?
[52:46.54]Because, like, once you reach a certain level of status in society, don't you, like, get invited to these events where, like, the president's there and he's like, oh, yeah, and he, like, tells you all this shit about ghosts or you're in a party and it's, like, all actors and they all, like, have the same, uh, what do they call it?
[53:00.35]What do they call it?
[53:01.99]Uh, there's a specific word I'm trying to think of.
[53:03.83]It's been nine days since I've left my home.
[53:08.19]What are you talking about?
[53:09.39]I think I'm getting invited to, like, fucking special events.
[53:12.05]Is that what you're implying?
[53:13.80]Well, you went to, like, the streamer awards.
[53:15.50]There wasn't, like, an Illuminati there?
[53:17.08]Yeah, we talk about aliens and ghosts and shit.
[53:24.14]Oh, yeah, I'm expecting to get, you know, 10k more subs this week.
[53:26.93]Yeah, because my, uh, yeah, I found a good ghost.
[53:28.79]I got a poltergeist.
[53:29.45]We were doing an exercise.
[53:30.33]You didn't hear any conversation like that.
[53:33.07]Hold on.
[53:33.41]This is important.
[53:34.17]I gotta get a Cow Mangler here.
[53:36.91]I have an opportunity to help the fucking team.
[53:39.84]Okay.
[53:40.36]What was your question?
[53:42.00]Do all the streamers talk about, like, ghosts and conspiracies and stuff?
[53:45.54]Is that what you're saying?
[53:46.18]I want to know you're not necessarily, and you said it's a whole can of worms, and now your ghost answer is I don't know.
[53:52.65]It really evolved from I was interested to what you had to say to you lost me.
[53:58.68]Because that's a very loaded question.
[54:02.41]That's like an hour and a half long conversation.
[54:05.77]Do you not want to have it?
[54:06.67]You're going to not play this game that long?
[54:08.61]I'm currently enjoying Team Fortress.
[54:11.07]And ever since we started talking about this, my skill level has dropped by at least 30%.
[54:14.67]Do you want to know why your skill level dropped?
[54:18.05]No, no, no, no, no.
[54:18.80]I was doing fine until we started talking about fucking aliens and ghosts and shit.
[54:21.24]Until we came to Venice!
[54:28.43]TL;DR.
[54:35.45]What?
[54:36.05]It missed him.
[54:37.23]You gotta be shitting me.
[54:39.98]Oh my god.
[54:40.58]How did that miss?
[54:42.76]That thing has a gigantic explosion radius.
[54:48.80]Okay, I gotta step it up here.
[54:50.04]I'm not doing very well.
[54:53.05]Time to play the worst possible thing I could play.
[54:57.95]Time to play spy.
[54:59.39]But the spy-sicle and the... What even is the loadout here?
[55:03.53]I forget how you play spy.
[55:06.33]The default revolver.
[55:07.55]Because the ambassador was nerfed and the enforcer was nerfed.
[55:11.07]And like every spy equipment has been nerfed.
[55:13.23]The Dead Ringer's been nerfed.
[55:22.72]Oh my, I had the spy-sicle.
[55:23.80]That was a mistake.
[55:36.05]That should not have happened.
[55:39.70]Why do you think it happened?
[55:41.18]I don't know, but there's a fucking scout over here.
[55:43.20]I need help.
[55:43.56]Blue team, help me.
[55:45.66]He's getting me.
[55:46.14]Help.
[55:48.22]Ow.
[55:51.52]Are you fucking kidding me?
[55:54.04]What happened?
[55:54.82]Oh, he's using the crossbow.
[55:57.10]I thought he was stream sniping.
[56:00.68]He's using the crossbow.
[56:08.73]I was calling for medic as a spy.
[56:11.43]And this guy, he kills me with crossbow.
[56:16.65]Okay.
[56:18.37]Kinda spooky.
[56:19.57]That was fucking funny.
[56:36.50]Medic.
[56:41.03]medic I'm not I'm a real person what is that thing that was cool did you um did you know they made the Liberty Launcher the best weapon in the whole game what do you mean that's just flat out they they buffed the Liberty Launcher it's the best weapon in the whole game now
[57:04.09]What was different before?
[57:05.97]Is it the blast damage?
[57:06.77]It's had like three different changes.
[57:09.15]They removed a lot of the downsides.
[57:11.83]I mean, 25% penalty is actually pretty bad considering.
[57:14.84]It's really not because you get an extra rocket and extra projectile speed that makes up for the consistency on the... Why don't I just use the stupid thing?
[57:23.50]The what thing?
[57:26.02]The sneeze gun.
[57:28.92]I don't know.
[57:29.34]Do it.
[57:29.61]Okay, you can only hold three.
[57:33.40]No matter what you do, it's not going to go well.
[57:36.44]And I'm not that's not I'm not being mean.
[57:38.12]That went pretty well.
[57:39.44]It's just Venice.
[57:54.20]I'm out of ammo already.
[57:56.11]Are you holding?
[57:58.09]I just actually scared the shit out of me.
[57:59.31]I thought something happened.
[58:05.54]I need ammo.
[58:06.10]Where's ammo on this map?
[58:08.36]Like everywhere.
[58:09.70]I better not fucking die.
[58:10.64]I swear to God.
[58:15.25]Oh, there we go.
[58:20.07]I almost got the conk and then we can really go for it.
[58:23.29]A what?
[58:27.54]That item that's on soldier.
[58:31.28]The Liberty Launcher?
[58:32.28]Conk, conk, conk, conk, conk, conk, conk, conk, conk, conk, conk.
[58:34.14]Conk, conk, conk.
[58:35.80]Let's go!
[58:36.26]Oh, let's get him!
[58:41.91]Oh, it's alright.
[58:45.15]I think you would have killed him if you had the Liberty Launcher.
[58:47.49]I don't think so.
[58:47.87]Or you would have had an extra rocket.
[58:53.22]This just makes sense.
[58:55.18]And you'd miss less because it goes faster.
[58:59.90]I'm using this fucking weird thing.
[59:04.34]For those of you that don't know, Team Fortress Classic is also one of my favorite games of all time.
[59:08.99]And I use this weapon all the time.
[59:11.77]Classic is you have to hold the button down and then release it to shoot.
[59:15.20]A lot of people say, trash item, fucking terrible.
[59:17.94]Just wait until you see somebody that knows what they're doing with it, and then you can fucking go talk about it.
[59:30.41]I was scrolling through my old TF2 videos the other day And even my description of the video I made about the classic was like why would you do this?
[59:37.53]Just get the ambassador and be invisible with it We'll see we will see it does make people pop when you kill them that's neat it is pretty neat Oh fuck
[60:05.10]He's terrible.
[60:07.10]A scout versus a sniper is an automatic loss with a sniper.
[60:11.55]Don't.
[60:12.45]Are you kidding me?
[60:13.25]You're digging yourself in deeper.
[60:14.65]Are you kidding me?
[60:15.75]Guys, he's not bad.
[60:21.21]Venice is haunted.
[60:31.21]Where do they even come from?
[60:32.81]Where's the enemies?
[60:33.63]Where's their, like, spawn?
[60:38.11]In the shadow realm.
[60:40.29]Don't think about it!
[60:53.09]My sensitivity is too high.
[60:56.99]I gotta drop it by, like, at least 10%.
[61:02.32]Yeah.
[61:02.70]Way, way, way too high.
[61:04.27]Way too high.
[61:04.97]Like, outrageously high.
[61:07.87]What is it at right now?
[61:10.39]No, I don't want it at zero.
[61:12.79]1.5.
[61:15.79]That's better.
[61:16.23]Okay.
[61:16.43]Oh, you got to be ready for the pub push.
[61:22.35]You got to be ready for the pub push, Jerma.
[61:23.81]5 seconds.
[61:25.99]10 seconds.
[61:27.41]12 seconds.
[61:28.27]11 seconds.
[61:28.59]2 seconds.
[61:29.43]You got to be ready, Jerma.
[61:36.26]I haven't played this game in fucking 10 years, dude.
[61:38.04]I don't... You weren't ready for the pub push.
[61:46.05]Come on.
[61:47.21]I'm just trying to figure out how to play the goddamn game again.
[61:56.57]Are we leaving again?
[61:59.03]Unless you want to play Venice again.
[62:00.17]I didn't find that map particularly terrible.
[62:02.95]It's just kind of big and too many places to go.
[62:08.94]Well, next time you're like, Venice isn't haunted.
[62:11.70]Remember, you've never won a game on it yet.
[62:14.36]We played on it one time.
[62:17.40]What a coincidence.
[62:19.21]Played it one time, lost one time.
[62:20.61]What a coincidence.
[62:23.21]I'm going to play with the bazooka's beggar.
[62:24.73]I said that backwards.
[62:29.38]The bazooka's beggar.
[62:31.28]It's been 10 years.
[62:38.96]Actually, it's been seven.
[62:44.78]Are you still going to play Viewfinder?
[62:47.60]I don't know.
[62:48.24]Maybe.
[62:50.29]This is great.
[62:52.33]It's been a while since I've jumped in and played and cared.
[62:54.53]It's fun.
[62:58.49]Open some crates.
[63:01.03]I could open a few crates, maybe.
[63:05.35]Maybe we'll save the crate stuff.
[63:09.35]For another day.
[63:12.09]Huh?
[63:12.99]Because I just want to play.
[63:14.73]But you already got the keys.
[63:18.23]Jerma, I want the Quaits opening.
[63:20.99]They don't disappear.
[63:26.24]More Team Fortress?
[63:27.26]Maybe, yeah.
[63:29.38]There's another new map.
[63:30.42]There's Shark Bay.
[63:31.22]Don't go in the water.
[63:31.92]There's sharks in the water.
[63:33.28]Sharks in the water.
[63:37.59]always vote yes always vote yes always okay don't even look don't even look um okay oh this is a off map uh where is everybody
[64:04.83]Yes, again?
[64:06.03]I mean, I don't know.
[64:08.47]Wait, what?
[64:09.35]Now I'm feeling like there's a little bit of a mix-up.
[64:11.60]Is it a mix-up?
[64:13.06]There may be.
[64:15.26]I still voted yes, anyway.
[64:18.24]He's gone.
[64:19.14]Okay.
[64:20.36]Where is the other team?
[64:23.54]I don't know.
[64:25.51]Should we just try again?
[64:27.03]Yeah, you vote yes.
[64:28.09]No, I mean, should we re-queue?
[64:33.26]I don't see anybody on red team.
[64:34.86]There's like three people over there.
[64:38.24]They're coming.
[64:43.62]Okay, I'm going to say at this point, stop voting yes.
[64:45.97]I think we're being trolled.
[64:48.05]Okay.
[64:51.27]But maybe one more.
[64:52.91]Okay.
[64:57.61]Oh, where's the other team?
[64:58.69]They're capping the point, mister.
[65:01.32]I got it.
[65:06.48]Have you ever seen a ghost?
[65:10.76]Now you have.
[65:16.25]Nice one.
[65:20.85]You've got to be fucking kidding me, dude.
[65:23.11]I hit the guy twice and I get randomly dead in one hit.
[65:27.14]You've still got some Venice on you.
[65:31.78]Hasn't worn off yet.
[65:43.57]It's very laggy, but I'm alright.
[65:52.60]Are they on it?
[65:55.16]They're dead.
[65:57.80]Now they're ghosts.
[66:02.70]Come on.
[66:04.64]How much does it take?
[66:05.47]I hit him like five times.
[66:10.74]Oh, this isn't your grandfather's FPS game.
[66:21.16]We get a little raunchy in here.
[66:22.88]I forgot about the eye lander.
[66:30.91]It is.
[66:31.89]It literally is.
[66:33.63]It actually is.
[66:35.19]Whoa.
[66:39.62]Is that me?
[66:42.20]Kill this motherfucker before he can build a sentry!
[66:54.91]There's so many people in there.
[66:56.73]Alright, I gotta like stick with something and stop switching every five seconds.
[67:01.67]Equip the pen.
[67:03.45]No, we're going back to soldier.
[67:09.96]I'm not allowed to get off of Soldier for the next 15 straight minutes, no matter what.
[67:14.85]It's not happening.
[67:35.83]Dude, the Liberty Launcher is incredible.
[67:38.57]Who ever buffed this weapon out of their mind?
[67:49.46]Fuck.
[67:52.66]What am I voting?
[68:00.42]What am I voting?
[68:07.13]That's a no from me.
[68:08.47]No.
[68:09.81]Okay.
[68:15.67]We can win it.
[68:16.07]You and I miss.
[68:30.64]What's that?
[68:37.01]um the ghastly gibbous that's a great hat yeah you're not seeing too many of them these days see some ironic gibbouses this weapon is awful I'm gonna play a different weapon
[69:09.15]I forgot it was inaccurate.
[69:10.77]I forgot it like shoots it like there's a deviation of like 20 or 30 degrees every time you shoot.
[69:24.80]There's what?
[69:25.68]Three medics?
[69:28.08]What is wrong with me?
[69:31.55]Do I stink?
[69:33.59]Maybe.
[69:34.50]Oh, no, because they're all healing you.
[69:36.43]What the fuck?
[69:37.53]Never mind.
[69:38.09]I get it now.
[69:41.39]He'll Ster.
[69:41.99]He's playing.
[69:44.65]You had three medics.
[69:49.07]Did I actually have three medics?
[69:51.84]Yeah.
[69:52.52]And seriously, I was running around with like 20 HP like... Hey, don't say no to that.
[69:56.30]That's me.
[69:58.78]I think we leave.
[69:59.34]Can we leave?
[70:00.28]Alright, let's leave.
[70:01.16]I think this is a three medic type of situation.
[70:05.26]Alright, I'm up.
[70:13.02]I think this is a vote kick random people until we can get three medics on Jerma.
[70:19.78]No, I don't think so.
[70:24.03]Alright.
[70:25.25]Don't believe in ghosts.
[70:27.22]Don't believe in, like, any conspiracy theories, apparently.
[70:29.52]You believe in Bigfoot?
[70:31.20]The Loch Ness Monster?
[70:33.06]Yeah.
[70:36.31]The Jersey... No!
[70:38.45]Wait, what do you mean?
[70:40.91]Is it the same game?
[70:41.53]It's the same, exactly.
[70:43.41]Oh, shit.
[70:43.97]Why did this game just crash?
[70:52.44]Okay, I think we joined and left too quickly.
[70:56.22]It says you're currently offline.
[70:57.64]Okay, well, I don't.
[70:59.82]We may have.
[71:00.54]I may have broken some stuff.
[71:02.10]I think you broke it.
[71:02.78]It's not letting me start search, but it does say a member of your party is offline.
[71:06.38]Okay, well, maybe restart TF2.
[71:09.12]Alright, restart.
[71:12.86]It's not Tuesday maintenance.
[71:13.92]It's literally Sunday.
[71:14.76]Okay, I'm going to restart TF2.
[71:19.41]And we'll go from there.
[71:22.79]you relaunching I'm relaunching give it a second it has to do that weird thing again you broke it you broke it the government broke it when I brought up bigfoot I mean bigfoot makes sense to me because this I mean there's a very real possibility that there's just like a huge gorilla just somewhere and it's just way bigger than everybody else
[71:54.28]They're called gorillas.
[71:57.12]Yeah, but like a Bigfoot could potentially just be a huge gorilla that people just... Oh my god, it's Bigfoot!
[72:01.92]No, dude, that's just a giant gorilla.
[72:07.08]Okay, I... Are we still in a party?
[72:09.61]Yeah.
[72:10.07]Okay.
[72:11.13]Should we try it again?
[72:12.39]Yeah, I'm doing it.
[72:13.07]Okay, go for it.
[72:21.45]There we go.
[72:22.07]Okay.
[72:25.54]In the US, in the wild, do you think a giant gorilla is walking around?
[72:29.29]I mean, I don't know.
[72:33.83]Possible.
[72:51.02]It's just a furry.
[72:54.48]I would buy that.
[72:56.15]yeah I was just he was like for the okay you want a weird story I don't think I've ever talked about this with you that you saw bigfoot one time well yeah but also okay um when I was a little kid we're talking like a real little like it may have been free school age okay uh I got a spider-man costume one Halloween and I loved it so we gotta leave uh okay
[73:26.49]This is the hardest part.
[73:27.27]You gotta find matches.
[73:30.94]Okay, so when I was a little kid in preschool, I had a Spider-Man costume for Halloween, and I loved it.
[73:37.00]And I just thought it was cool to, like, be Spider-Man.
[73:38.92]So I'd just wear it on days that weren't Halloween, and I'd, like, go out back and, like, play around in my Spider-Man outfit.
[73:45.19]And I would never wear clothes under it because I wanted to authentically be Spider-Man.
[73:49.83]And my brother hated it.
[73:51.39]My brother hated it because I have an older brother.
[73:53.89]And me and my mom would go pick up my brother from school and I would wear the Spider-Man outfit to greet him when he's like coming out of school and like all his friends see like little Spider-Man running up to him.
[74:03.97]He's like, that's so not cool.
[74:05.37]And I think my mom would bring me along just because like she knew he hated it.
[74:11.93]So you were like a, you were like a practical joke.
[74:17.05]yeah so my chat says where is this going bigfoot is totally just someone like testing out their first seat 100 I can relate to that alright alright are we are we going forward here because like this is this is it this is the one I've got I've got my going here and now I'm going full on no I'm going engineer this is my map on engineer now I'll play good here check this out top 15 minutes on soldier it doesn't count
[74:45.26]It is a new map.
[74:50.01]Who cares about what wrench I'm using?
[74:51.15]I just gotta equip one.
[74:53.43]Come on!
[74:56.99]How did you do that?
[75:05.80]My mom says I can confirm, so I guess that is why she brought me.
[75:10.82]I don't know if she's saying I can confirm that's why she brought me or I can confirm bigfoot is just a guy testing a fursuit she may know more it's been a while
[75:37.05]Alright, I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go now, I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go now!
[75:39.89]I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go, I'll be back.
[75:41.67]Where's our sentry?
[75:42.55]Fuck, hold on.
[75:43.21]It's been a long time.
[75:44.51]The gate's opening.
[75:45.65]It's been a long time.
[75:46.99]Hold on.
[75:48.25]I didn't have the right equipment.
[75:49.94]Just wait.
[75:50.58]It's been ten years.
[75:52.48]Where are you putting it?
[75:53.88]I'm going up here.
[75:56.12]I hope it gets to build.
[76:00.20]I'm keeping an eye on you.
[76:01.20]Keep an eye on me, please.
[76:02.13]It's been ten years.
[76:09.59]And that Pyro would not have been able to be there.
[76:12.09]Spy, spy.
[76:12.75]Good, I'm good.
[76:14.15]I wanted to die so I could come and get this entry.
[76:19.42]Everything's fine.
[76:20.24]Protect my shit for a minute.
[76:22.00]It's... What shit?
[76:23.82]There's a spy.
[76:24.82]There's a spy!
[76:25.48]There's a spy back there and he's eyeing my fucking cool building.
[76:30.74]Uh, your medic defended it.
[76:33.02]Let's go.
[76:36.13]Alright, now I'm good.
[76:37.49]That's a spy right there, no doubt.
[76:44.84]We're good.
[76:45.52]I got you.
[76:46.66]It's me.
[76:50.67]Alright, let's go check it out.
[76:53.09]It's a cool weapon skin.
[77:00.67]I don't know why I do that.
[77:01.81]I'm just such a weirdo.
[77:02.95]I can't help it.
[77:06.02]He's a freak.
[77:23.47]I don't know why the fuck I do that.
[77:27.55]Spies around here.
[77:28.29]Watch out.
[77:29.03]Keep your eyes peeled.
[77:30.39]Oh, nice pick up.
[77:31.37]Nice pick up.
[77:32.15]See, you don't think I know what the fuck I'm doing?
[77:37.03]Got the Wrangler?
[77:38.13]No.
[77:40.61]Then do you really know?
[77:41.99]I mean, I don't like the Wrangler.
[77:43.63]I don't like how it turns your sentry off for like three seconds.
[77:45.93]You know, they completely changed the short circuit as well.
[77:49.23]Did they really?
[77:50.33]Yeah.
[77:50.89]It's really weird now.
[77:53.16]It shoots like a spear.
[77:57.23]That's kind of cool.
[78:04.31]I'll short circuit.
[78:07.51]I'm doing fine.
[78:08.85]I'm good.
[78:12.11]Okay, so do you understand that you're doing fine because people are helping you?
[78:15.22]Are you denying my help?
[78:17.38]Engineer is the class that is incredible.
[78:20.52]Soldiers above you.
[78:25.21]Engineer is insanely important, but it requires teamwork for it to... He had the crits.
[78:32.56]He had the crits.
[78:33.86]All my stuff is still there besides sentry.
[78:35.04]It's fine.
[78:37.60]I just need to whack my sentry... Whack my teleport at once.
[78:42.28]Okay.
[78:46.38]And there goes everything else.
[78:48.88]I got your dispenser saved.
[78:50.94]If that matters.
[78:53.12]It might.
[78:56.11]That actually might be a huge deal.
[79:00.31]I'm moving this.
[79:02.01]My accolades.
[79:08.78]I'm, uh... Alright, I'm moving.
[79:10.52]I'm moving my shit.
[79:12.58]Are we good?
[79:13.08]Are they on it?
[79:13.80]Or should I... Um... No, you're good.
[79:15.21]I think we're still alright.
[79:17.31]That was getting heavy.
[79:25.29]We're holding.
[79:26.57]Yeah, we are.
[79:26.99]They're moving it.
[79:43.48]They're moving it.
[79:46.04]Oh, shit.
[79:46.36]Not for long.
[79:52.60]I freaked out and I grabbed my dispenser and died.
[79:56.84]Hey, I'm doing fine, though.
[79:58.56]You're doing great.
[80:00.72]Turn off motion blur.
[80:02.08]Is it on?
[80:03.30]Probably.
[80:03.76]Oh, shit.
[80:04.56]It goes default on.
[80:06.70]Well, that fucking was loud.
[80:07.70]Mission ends in 10 seconds.
[80:22.85]No!
[80:24.59]Hey, nice.
[80:30.75]The sentry being up at the time that it did and the zoning that it provided, I believe I should get at least five friend points for that.
[80:39.58]You should also get five friend points because you protected my nest when I was not there.
[80:46.10]Where are we on friend points right now?
[80:47.78]Am I above you?
[80:49.26]You have 11.
[80:50.84]I have nine.
[80:53.40]Yeah, we're pretty close in points.
[80:56.55]Wait, those points are friend points?
[80:59.59]Yeah.
[81:00.29]Alright, I'm going to go back to... I thought I had a strange Gunslinger a long time ago.
[81:07.01]Maybe not.
[81:09.90]Let me see the short circuit.
[81:12.84]Fire launches a projectile consuming energy ball.
[81:16.62]65 metal.
[81:16.88]That's a lot.
[81:18.28]Yeah.
[81:24.14]short circuit was kind of insanely good was it yeah so you have to destroy projectiles with the ball you can't just do it forever I'm not sure dude you've been getting weird ever since you got bitten by that bird what when did I get bit by a bird you didn't get bit by a bird is what you're saying
[81:53.62]Are you denying it?
[81:54.53]Are you seriously going to go live right now in front of all these people and deny it?
[81:58.49]Does that mean I'm being chased by a bird and pecked in the head or something?
[82:04.69]How do you get bit by a bird?
[82:07.17]I have a bird story.
[82:11.06]My mom's here.
[82:11.90]I have the mom bird story follow-up.
[82:14.04]You've got a lot of stories, don't you?
[82:19.50]You could say that.
[82:22.30]It was my birthday and there was a bird flying around.
[82:23.98]It was being really weird.
[82:24.78]It was going crazy.
[82:25.42]It was coming for my birthday cake or something.
[82:27.16]And my mom smashed it with a bag full of eaten corn husks and smashed it down on the ground.
[82:33.68]What?
[82:35.25]She defended me from the bird.
[82:36.33]It was going.
[82:36.71]It was insane.
[82:38.05]Like, have you seen the movie The Birds?
[82:39.89]It was like that bird.
[82:41.05]So wait, so you didn't have friends.
[82:42.53]You were being attacked by a bird.
[82:45.19]Yeah.
[82:48.80]What the fuck?
[82:51.84]Yep.
[82:55.27]It was a birdemic.
[82:57.43]But real.
[83:00.54]Alright, now that we're out, I can do this.
[83:03.66]No, we're not.
[83:04.08]There's a soldier back here.
[83:08.06]What the fuck is happening?
[83:09.18]There's people just back here behind the cart.
[83:15.12]They must have a teleporter or something weird.
[83:22.91]Unfortunate.
[83:26.76]They have to have a teleporter, right?
[83:29.47]I didn't see one.
[83:30.25]I was jumping around all over the place.
[83:37.49]Okay.
[83:49.08]Somebody's killed that guy.
[83:49.98]Oh, no.
[83:50.32]Okay, he's...
[83:55.28]Alright, I'm bringing this all the way up.
[83:57.04]Make sure I don't get killed by anybody.
[84:02.31]Alright, so far so good.
[84:03.37]Alright, get on it.
[84:21.26]What?
[84:21.62]How come every time you die you don't scream as though you died in real life?
[84:27.05]Because it's childish.
[84:34.82]Okay, see you in the next circus stream.
[84:40.90]You grown adult clown.
[84:47.40]So what?
[84:47.82]Clowns just should not exist anymore?
[84:50.41]There should never be a clown?
[84:52.03]The only way clowns should exist if you're adult is if you're into the clown OC.
[84:57.00]So you're saying that we should not have... Clowns should not exist anymore.
[85:02.34]There should never be another clown.
[85:03.52]That is not what I just said.
[85:05.22]That's very different.
[85:06.52]But an adult clown.
[85:09.14]Who is a clown that's not an adult?
[85:11.42]What are you talking about?
[85:14.94]Oh, fuck.
[85:15.22]That blew up.
[85:16.20]But who enjoys clowns?
[85:18.52]Adults are clowns, but who enjoys clowns?
[85:21.84]So what?
[85:22.64]So your opinion on entertainment is we should just delete everything that's not your opinion of entertainment?
[85:27.75]Is that what you're saying?
[85:29.25]Tell me your opinion on D4.
[85:33.86]It's not good.
[85:35.54]It's not good at all.
[85:36.94]It's not good at all.
[85:38.00]Oh, yeah, because you have the crowd now.
[85:39.98]It like isn't even a thing anymore.
[85:41.52]Like they said on their own live stream.
[85:43.90]Yeah, it's just not fun.
[85:45.44]Our bullet point is.
[85:46.44]That's not true.
[85:47.06]We need to make the game fun.
[85:48.16]They didn't even bring it up.
[85:49.22]They skipped the bullet point because they can't do it.
[85:50.86]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[85:51.54]Hold on.
[85:52.02]Rewind.
[85:52.78]Back it up.
[85:53.82]Take 10 steps backwards.
[85:55.70]Yeah.
[85:55.96]Who was free months ago?
[85:57.68]At least a month ago.
[85:58.78]Somebody said, hey, dude, how do you feel about D4?
[86:00.24]And I went, you do not want to hear my D4 opinion.
[86:03.92]Oh, no, you don't want to hear it.
[86:06.17]And they were like, oh, shit, he hates it.
[86:07.61]And I'm like, oh, I hate it.
[86:09.79]So, excuse me.
[86:11.67]I'm sorry.
[86:14.65]Yeah, but now you're allowed to, like, actually say it.
[86:17.97]I did.
[86:18.55]You've been given permission.
[86:20.76]Who gave you permission?
[86:21.98]Nobody gave me permission.
[86:23.88]I just decided that, you know, okay, listen.
[86:26.69]I think Diablo 4 is a good video game that is not going to be done for like three years.
[86:35.55]That's my real opinion.
[86:37.13]Okay.
[86:38.43]I think there is a good video game there, but it's going to take like four years before it gets there.
[86:46.80]Spy.
[86:50.80]It really was a spy.
[86:53.47]only four I don't know I'm gonna play path of exile 2 anyways so what the who fucking cares oh he's a real one I played d4 it was like yeah it was alright like the end game was kind of fucking terrible and I was like whatever I'm done I don't want to have the same unique drop eight times I'm done that's it that's all I need to say that's it
[87:24.11]Do you need more of an opinion?
[87:25.19]I think that covers it.
[87:27.29]I need your opinion on ghosts.
[87:29.41]Hold on, have an opinion on him.
[87:34.61]Alright, see if I can get.
[87:42.67]I need a teleporter.
[87:43.41]This is bad.
[87:44.91]I need someone to destroy the mini sentry that is in the complete wide open.
[87:50.87]Next to the cart.
[87:53.35]I'm an engineer.
[87:54.29]Nope.
[87:54.61]The uber soldier.
[87:56.37]Please.
[87:58.19]Someone.
[87:59.11]Hey, look, bud.
[88:00.75]I'm an engineer.
[88:06.07]I solve practical problems.
[88:17.96]That's you right now.
[88:18.78]Yeah.
[88:25.25]That was a loud spy decloak sound.
[88:27.39]I don't know where he is.
[88:42.40]They're all coming up that way.
[88:46.04]What the fuck did I just do?
[88:47.62]What just happened?
[88:48.38]Oh, right.
[88:48.76]That's what I wanted.
[88:50.22]Oh my fucking god.
[88:51.50]I pressed 4 and then 5 and then 1 and then 2 and then 3 and... 4 and then 5 and then 2 and then 1 and 3.
[88:58.85]I gotta get my muscle memory back to playing Engineer.
[89:05.01]Still there, though.
[89:10.47]Thanks for the teleporter, chump.
[89:12.73]You're welcome.
[89:17.82]I did.
[89:22.74]I'm sorry.
[89:23.46]I respect you as an engineer.
[89:26.04]We are about to get this point though.
[89:27.90]We are.
[89:30.61]Now I'm going to go over here.
[89:31.85]And try to build up some shit over here.
[89:38.47]I'm going to.
[89:40.35]OK, everything is good now.
[89:48.65]In fact, I might.
[89:49.85]I don't want to move it that far because I don't want anyone to get killed.
[89:54.05]Where is it?
[89:54.41]It's in this room.
[89:55.77]I'm a pyro.
[89:56.47]I can help you.
[89:57.17]I'm like the only pyro on the team.
[89:58.88]Oh, you're good.
[90:01.98]Okay, but I thought it was about teamwork.
[90:05.52]It is.
[90:07.80]Until it's me.
[90:11.36]I think we're just going to win.
[90:19.53]It's five, right?
[90:20.28]I don't know where he's going, but he went that way.
[90:26.42]You know what?
[90:26.70]Fuck it.
[90:26.86]I'm going to make it quicker.
[90:29.34]This is stupid, but whatever.
[90:30.78]It's like an extra five steps you don't have to take.
[90:35.69]That will be the difference maker.
[90:37.27]It actually might.
[90:37.81]Okay.
[90:50.69]Help.
[90:55.07]Help.
[90:56.27]Come on.
[90:56.61]Pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure.
[90:58.17]Help.
[90:58.95]Help.
[91:00.25]Help.
[91:04.43]Entrance teleport.
[91:05.43]Wait, what's going on?
[91:07.81]Teleporter.
[91:08.65]Wait, what did I do?
[91:10.51]Did you do it backwards?
[91:11.65]No, no, I didn't.
[91:12.69]This is teleporter exit.
[91:15.65]Yeah, you're good.
[91:27.26]You're doing great.
[91:27.92]Man, I am taking damage.
[91:32.71]My buttons are so fucked up.
[91:34.87]It's like mouse button.
[91:36.01]Why is it mouse four to do that?
[91:38.89]Okay, that's very weird.
[91:41.27]It's not three.
[91:42.49]It's mouse four.
[91:46.68]I wish I could explain why that just happened.
[91:52.03]Oh, you blew up the exit.
[91:53.49]I know, but my keybinds, I had to have had a reason like 10 years ago to do that.
[92:01.76]What was the reason?
[92:02.64]You're still the same person.
[92:03.84]What did you do that for?
[92:04.90]Why did you do this?
[92:06.02]I just killed a spy.
[92:15.31]Ah!
[92:17.87]Oh, no.
[92:18.93]He didn't even kill my shit.
[92:26.70]Oh, no.
[92:27.26]Alright.
[92:27.62]Alright.
[92:28.18]Alright.
[92:29.94]Alright.
[92:31.28]Do you need a hand?
[92:33.58]Everyone's just waiting for it to be done, and it's not even fucking close.
[92:49.51]What?
[92:50.65]He's at the entrance.
[92:52.95]You motherfucker.
[92:54.05]I'm coming back there.
[92:59.45]I think we're losing.
[93:01.05]We need the teleporter now.
[93:02.43]It's there.
[93:02.93]It's there.
[93:03.31]It's there.
[93:03.65]It's there.
[93:03.93]I promise.
[93:04.31]We need it now.
[93:08.15]Well, you can't just demand things, okay?
[93:18.30]Fuck you.
[93:19.90]This guy just killed like three of us.
[93:25.19]What?
[93:41.04]I'm now remembering the Huntsman's not okay.
[93:46.13]Like being killed by it or using it?
[93:48.75]It does a lot of damage.
[93:50.47]It's really hard to use.
[93:51.41]When's the last time you tried it?
[93:52.65]When the enemy team has a lot of heavies.
[93:55.33]I'm saying it's like brutal for them.
[93:57.67]They can't really move.
[93:58.99]And it's like 360 for like no charge time.
[94:02.26]You just hop out at a heavy.
[94:04.64]Yeah.
[94:15.08]Keep track.
[94:16.56]I'm being very aware of everybody.
[94:18.04]This is risky.
[94:23.77]This is really risky, but fuck it.
[94:25.09]I'm doing it.
[94:27.47]Insanely risky.
[94:28.79]We're moving up.
[94:29.39]We're on the cart.
[94:30.31]We're winning right now.
[94:31.11]If you're moving up, it's a good time.
[94:35.13]Oh, that motherfucker back here.
[94:38.42]Spy, he's going to get me.
[94:39.10]He's going to get me.
[94:39.56]He's going to get me.
[94:40.24]He's good.
[94:40.50]He's good.
[94:40.72]He's really good.
[94:42.26]Got him.
[94:45.14]Or I got one of them.
[94:45.80]There's a few.
[94:51.21]How did he not die?
[95:06.87]What the fuck?
[95:07.77]I tried to back up, but he still got me with it.
[95:10.17]What just happened?
[95:11.07]I knew he was gonna do that shit.
[95:13.74]So I backed up, and he still got behind me?
[95:16.72]What the fuck are you talking about?
[95:19.46]Spy.
[95:20.24]What the fuck?
[95:22.38]I knew he was gonna do that, so I backed up, and he still got it.
[95:26.29]Spy.
[95:28.19]You got trickstabbed.
[95:30.81]Yeah, that's fu- whatever.
[95:41.76]Your Boston is coming out now.
[95:47.88]Oh, we're good.
[95:48.24]You're not going to fucking trickstaff me anymore.
[95:53.22]God damn it.
[95:57.84]Can we get a teleporter?
[95:59.08]Dude, this spy is just... He's just killing me over and over again.
[96:06.56]There's a dude that's just making my life a living hell, even if I try to look for him.
[96:12.52]okay can we get a teleporter is what I have yeah it was there and then you you're not spy you're not you're not spy checking good enough dude you're washed up uh I was washed up in TF2 probably like seven or eight years ago so that's alright I was washed up like years ago

[96:51.77]Yeah.
[97:01.99]Oh shit.
[97:02.31]The sniper up there.
[97:02.91]You know what?
[97:11.22]Fuck it.

[97:17.05]Are we?
[97:18.14]Yeah, fuck it.
[97:18.58]Let's just bring a teleport in here.
[97:21.56]Yeah, there's a good room.
[97:23.46]That sniper is going to try to kill us.
[97:25.56]Yeah, he is.
[97:27.68]He's gaming.
[97:28.24]Can't do much about it.
[97:30.18]Shit.
[97:34.45]Okay, well, it's not there anymore.
[97:40.61]You should do it in the room before that is where you should be putting it.
[97:43.09]Probably.
[97:45.38]We still won.
[97:47.59]Nice job.
[97:47.97]Did we earn facecam yet?
[97:51.83]Maybe in like another 10 minutes.
[97:52.65]If you're good.
[98:03.27]That was good.
[98:04.57]You don't think we should stay?
[98:06.15]No, you should not.
[98:07.13]Okay.
[98:10.39]As a professional killstreaker,
[98:16.36]have her we should leave I'm gonna go for the Huntsman I used to be so good with this and I mean that unironically this video is on my channel of me just fucking destroying like 20 kills in one life and shit it's I don't even know how I go back and watch those old TF2 Huntsman videos and I say how did I even do that I could never do that no ever don't put your mind to it you can do anything
[98:45.10]There's one string in a... I think it's on Nucleus.
[98:50.04]I just hit like 10 headshots in a row over the course of like maybe 30 to 40 seconds.
[98:56.50]It's fucking crazy.
[98:58.33]Was that Jerma is mad?
[99:00.25]No, no, no, no.
[99:02.09]This is like just a regular commentary.
[99:04.89]Same thing.
[99:05.41]When we were playing Nucleus in that video, I will never play an FPS game better than that.
[99:10.71]I was so motivated.
[99:12.92]I hit every shot I took.
[99:20.77]Oh, I forgot about these shields, right?
[99:22.54]This is what I had on.
[99:26.44]Can't be burnt.
[99:31.08]Oh, I'll do Jurati.
[99:31.88]Alright, let's see if I still got it.
[99:34.22]I definitely don't.
[99:34.92]This weapon's really hard to use.
[99:39.96]That's why they call it the Luxman.
[99:42.54]Because it's very difficult to use.
[99:47.77]I shouldn't be using this.
[99:57.88]Doesn't that matter?
[99:59.52]It does matter a whole lot.
[100:07.74]Why just let me play?
[100:18.65]Nice.
[100:32.26]What?
[100:33.41]A bad jump of all the jumps?
[100:39.15]Ah, I gotta go a little higher.
[100:43.45]Oh, goodness.
[100:46.72]Whoa!
[100:50.32]They're all Jarate-ed.
[100:54.94]Mmm...
[101:05.73]Oh, I thought it was right in the head.
[101:12.49]Level one in the corner.
[101:15.71]Destroy this entry now.
[101:20.86]Ouch.
[101:24.76]Damn it.
[101:25.42]Alright, I'm doing alright.
[101:28.34]You got to go a little bit higher.
[101:29.16]There's a little bit of drop on the Huntsman.
[101:31.56]Hmm.
[101:39.84]Show us all your hats.
[101:41.49]I'll show my backpack in a little bit.
[101:43.65]He doesn't care.
[101:44.53]What?
[101:44.78]No, don't kill me!
[102:16.56]yeah I did that I'm the reason we pushed the cart because their whole team was in spawn chasing me around
[102:46.81]Is that Pyro, though?
[102:52.81]This guy's flying around!
[102:56.63]Holy shit, that guy went across the whole map!
[103:00.05]Alright, this guy.
[103:14.88]God, are you fucking kidding me?
[103:16.06]I thought I could catch him on the way down.
[103:18.76]Alright, can somebody kill this market garden soldier that's flying around the map and killing everybody?
[103:30.78]Fuckin' the stupidness.
[103:32.42]I hate Market Gardener battles.
[103:34.94]Are you doing it too?
[103:36.88]Yeah.
[103:49.20]Alright, this is where you shine as Huntsman because people just poke their heads out and you're getting headshots every five seconds.
[103:54.92]I want to see five right now.
[103:59.14]A little bit higher.
[104:00.02]I'm aiming a little too low.
[104:08.95]Oh my god, dude.
[104:10.39]Fucking somebody kill him.
[104:12.05]You...
[104:16.54]Just shoot him.
[104:17.34]I did, and it didn't kill him.
[104:18.68]He was covered in Jurati, too.
[104:20.47]The guy with no gun?
[104:21.87]The guy market gardening.
[104:25.23]With no gun?
[104:26.43]I Juratied him.
[104:27.51]I shot him with an arrow.
[104:28.91]He was still alive and killed me with the fucking shovel.
[104:32.91]Okay.
[104:33.53]Alright.
[104:34.11]Okay.
[104:34.46]That's what happened.
[104:37.62]Okay.
[104:38.22]Alright.
[104:38.76]Okay.
[104:39.32]Okay.
[104:39.74]Okay.
[104:40.10]Alright.
[104:40.54]Okay.
[104:41.04]Okay.
[104:48.12]He's back.
[104:48.44]He's back.
[104:48.72]He's back.
[104:49.08]He's back.
[104:49.60]He's back.
[104:49.98]He's back.
[104:50.30]And he's just... He's back.
[104:51.44]And that's what he's doing.
[104:52.28]He's just trying to kill me.
[104:53.18]He's just coming for me.
[104:54.04]He's coming to kill me.
[104:54.60]That's what he's doing.
[104:56.46]That's what he's doing.
[104:57.10]That's what he's doing.
[105:02.78]Worth.
[105:04.66]They respected it.
[105:05.74]I like... I appreciate that.
[105:12.70]You sucks.
[105:16.08]Smite!
[105:19.13]I got him.
[105:28.37]Oh, my fucking god.
[105:29.65]Okay, I think he comes over here, tries to kill me, and then runs until I get a full health, and then comes back to kill me again.
[105:36.32]No.
[105:41.88]Yeah, why wouldn't?
[105:43.54]That's what you do in Team Fortress 2.
[105:47.23]you go you try and kill him on respawn you can get health if your health slow that wasn't in the head looks like it there we go oh he just saved your sniper friend's life
[106:21.77]He's beginning to believe just a little.
[106:28.12]Ooh, a teleporter.
[106:30.70]You won't look at me.
[106:32.22]What was that?
[106:38.71]Like fucking weasel lap.
[106:43.93]That's the sound you make before you switch class.
[106:51.10]Ah, I hit him again, but it didn't kill him.
[106:52.97]Trying to get him up.
[106:58.75]Shit, he hit me.
[107:05.82]I wish these were headshots, but they're like neck shots.
[107:11.44]I still have to go even higher.
[107:12.50]Yeah, I'm afraid to go higher.
[107:15.98]You won't get hurt.
[107:17.10]I used to sit on what TR walkway for like three hours straight.
[107:20.97]Just shooting at people with the Huntsman.
[107:27.89]Here walkways are real one.
[107:30.48]Yeah, I was.
[107:31.08]Alright, who's up there?
[107:56.89]Isn't it great how you know when I die?
[107:58.40]Yeah.
[107:59.92]Why don't you make noises when you die?
[108:01.84]I am making noises.
[108:02.66]You don't hear them?
[108:04.22]Like death noises.
[108:09.70]No, no.
[108:10.50]I'm seeing a lot of pogs.
[108:12.22]No, you can't pog until I get the headshots down again.
[108:16.00]But, I mean, I'm making noise when I get hit.
[108:20.08]No, you're not.
[108:21.34]Yes, I am.
[108:25.58]No, you're not.
[108:34.13]I might need sensitivity down a little more.
[108:41.32]There's no such thing as sensitivity.
[108:43.06]Fail RP.
[108:45.60]What they have a cheater.
[108:48.35]He didn't even his gun didn't even turn and look at me.
[108:57.85]Shit.
[109:02.82]Oh, we're on it.
[109:05.22]But you can't kick bots if you're on the enemy team.
[109:08.24]Someone from the other team has to kick them.
[109:10.22]It's kind of awkward.
[109:20.29]Hey, where was he going?
[109:25.77]Oh, I kind of fucked it up.
[109:31.45]You typed that in party chat, by the way.
[109:35.00]I don't actually know what the all chat is.
[109:38.20]I really do not know what my button is.
[109:40.86]You were like privately.
[109:42.04]Oh, that was a good one.
[109:49.00]Shit.
[109:54.82]It's Y apparently.
[109:56.60]Yeah, I got it.
[110:00.37]We have a lot of time though.
[110:16.89]Holy shit!
[110:21.35]Ah, I thought I could get two.
[110:23.27]Oh my god, I should have just swung at them with the fucking melee.
[110:32.51]My energy levels are increasing.
[110:35.41]What does that mean?
[110:36.71]That means exactly what it means.
[110:38.87]Got it.
[110:39.83]One shot of Jerm of protein shake and your energy levels will be increasing.
[110:50.62]What?
[110:51.04]No way.
[110:51.84]Alright.
[110:52.50]Now this is where this is going to shine.
[110:56.21]I got a cool hat.
[111:00.26]Make sure you buy Jerma's milk.
[111:04.27]That's not for sale.
[111:14.25]Let me just hold on.
[111:15.53]They kind of still have a cheating bot on their team.
[111:19.76]Do you want to leave?
[111:21.92]No, it's upward.
[111:25.16]That's why you stay.
[111:30.19]I'll check this out, check this out.
[111:31.21]Does this still work?
[111:35.28]Like when everybody gets up to the front gate and you can hit them with Jurati before the gate opens.
[111:39.12]That's the thing, right?
[111:41.70]What is?
[111:42.66]Like I can coat them with Jurati like at one second because they're all going to sit at the door and be impatient.
[111:48.25]You can try.
[111:50.21]Are you good enough?
[111:51.51]I think so.
[111:54.15]Ready?
[111:54.35]Here comes everybody in 123.
[112:04.55]He just goes back in spawn.
[112:17.97]Oh, I thought he was going to walk back.
[112:19.71]Where are you?
[112:20.83]Spawn.
[112:22.29]Spawn?
[112:22.69]You dead?
[112:23.29]I just died.
[112:24.83]How come you didn't make a death noise?
[112:28.16]That was kind of a before death sound.
[112:34.98]When you die, you're gonna be like, oh man, I made a mistake there.
[112:38.12]What I actually should have done is... No, you're dead, dude.
[112:43.76]Play Scout?
[112:47.04]I could.
[112:48.12]Maybe.
[112:53.14]That hurt.
[112:55.50]Where are you?
[112:57.88]I need you.
[112:58.57]I'm a medic.
[112:59.33]He's a Market Gardener.
[113:08.70]Ah.
[113:18.09]He missed.
[113:27.88]This dang fool!
[113:36.77]Oh, I was about to go on a fucking run right there.
[113:43.33]Where are you?
[113:44.05]I need you.
[113:45.19]I'm playing Huntsman Sniper.
[113:46.35]What do you need me for?
[113:47.11]I need you.
[113:48.60]I'm dead.
[113:55.02]I'm alive now and I just said medic.
[113:57.76]I have like a cool hat on.
[113:59.36]There's a soldier behind you.
[114:03.14]Where?
[114:04.94]Is he dead?
[114:07.46]He's dead, man.
[114:08.66]You want 50 FOV?
[114:09.92]No.
[114:11.70]It'd be funny if I was.
[114:16.65]Why are you doing that?
[114:20.47]Why would you do that?
[114:22.43]Why not?
[114:22.75]You're going to get screamed at in the chat now.
[114:25.67]Oh, this is a serious match.
[114:39.10]I thought there's gonna be a lot more people out there than it was.
[114:50.29]Oh shit.
[114:57.78]I'm gonna play like gamer medic.
[115:02.65]Play with a real weapon, please.
[115:04.21]OK.
[115:09.44]Like one random sticky.
[115:11.32]Heavy goes first.
[115:12.02]Heavy goes first.
[115:12.58]That's priority.
[115:14.85]You get priority.
[115:15.35]You're heavy.
[115:16.85]I'm a support class.
[115:38.43]I got you Frank the fish.
[115:45.23]Everyone is hurt all the time.
[115:54.70]Later, do you mean later?
[115:57.58]Our demo just charged by the map.
[116:04.10]I got you Frank the fish.
[116:07.49]Thanks bro.
[116:09.45]Let's get him.
[116:09.99]Let's get him.
[116:10.55]Let's get him.
[116:10.91]You ready?
[116:11.33]No, I'm dead.
[116:12.39]Coward.
[116:16.38]Actually, the Heatmaker, I don't want it here.
[116:20.12]Give me the default.
[116:24.22]Heatmaker is good, but you got to get a lot of kills.
[116:28.99]That's one of the more headshots you get, right?
[116:31.13]You get faster.
[116:31.93]No, that's the other one.
[116:33.19]The Bazaar Bargain is extremely powerful now.
[116:39.55]would recommend though it's mostly the same as like default unless you get headshots that was a headshot right there oh you see that 150 almost
[117:05.76]Say it.
[117:07.74]I'm trying to... Oh, that would have been good.
[117:09.92]It was close.
[117:16.52]I'm gaming, man.
[117:17.36]I'm trying.
[117:27.00]What are you doing?
[117:27.62]Get him, get him, get him, get him.
[117:29.08]There's nobody to shoot at.
[117:30.24]Come on, shoot.
[117:30.92]There's nobody to shoot at.
[117:39.70]You're up on the leaderboard there.
[117:42.93]That's me.
[117:44.35]The medic.
[117:47.15]Alright, uh, leaving, right?
[117:48.95]Uh, we're voting upward, right?
[117:50.05]Uh, does that mean we stay?
[117:52.79]Do you want to vote upward?
[117:54.29]I'll click on upward if you want to.
[117:56.47]Can't really click it for some reason.
[117:58.85]Oh.
[118:00.09]Are we staying?
[118:01.51]Yeah.
[118:01.73]Alright, something seems broken though.
[118:03.87]I can't vote anything.
[118:04.91]Neither can I. Go risk on.
[118:13.55]this happens I sure hope it's gold rush I love gold rush I wouldn't care they nerfed the bonk atomic punch I can see why that's the one where you drink it and you become invincible and you just run behind enemy lines
[118:39.58]yeah I think you run slower and depending on the amount of damage you take you after it ends you get slowed around upward you should be happy I am happy what do I want to do I go flog pyro on not on offense
[119:10.88]The hell is going on?
[119:22.79]I got this cool item.
[119:24.75]The Nostromo.
[119:27.35]Napalmer.
[119:27.83]I remember people wanted this shit, didn't they?
[119:31.23]Some of the other tie-in items, right?
[119:36.06]Equip the pen.
[119:51.75]Jetpack is good.
[119:54.81]Do you have it?

[120:57.13]If I shot that crit rocket back, that would have been fucking awesome.
[121:08.51]Alright, sometimes I'm into Pyro and I do well, and sometimes I just die after walking out the front door over and over again.
[121:24.31]Ouch.
[121:26.75]I'm a death magnet.
[121:31.37]What is this hit sound?
[121:32.83]It's kind of like the little gurgles.
[121:33.87]I don't know what it is.
[121:38.41]Jeez, that guy killed me very fast.
[121:40.13]What the hell?
[121:41.86]Degreaser?

[124:30.61]Shit.
[124:33.27]Oh, he's gonna go up there.
[124:34.25]Damn it.
[124:38.33]You have a cat puke hit sound?
[124:39.81]It kind of is.
[124:56.08]Watch that right side.
[125:00.26]Is he actually dead-dead?
[125:01.14]I don't think so.
[125:09.69]Oh, fuck you!
[125:10.59]It didn't hit anybody!
[125:11.83]What the fuck?
[125:12.73]How?
[125:13.19]It went through.
[125:13.91]It threaded a needle, dude.
[125:15.31]That was... Oh, come on.
[125:26.23]Shit.
[125:26.37]They have a crit.

[125:38.19]That sounds fun.
[125:38.59]Oh, that's not going to work.
[126:02.25]Oh, I hit him.
[126:05.81]You're using the volcano fragment.
[126:07.40]Oh, mega lull.
[126:08.28]What's wrong with it?
[126:10.40]Oh, the rift volcano weapon?
[126:13.04]From the great game Rift?
[126:16.38]Yeah, this is fine.
[126:18.25]It's a cool weapon.
[126:20.47]That's the worst weapon in the game?
[126:24.35]Isn't the cool factor of having a fire axe cool? ...
[126:35.41]Can I destroy this sentry in the middle of the open?
[126:38.19]Maybe.
[126:38.41]I'm going medic.
[126:52.70]Oh, I forget.
[126:53.10]This is like the stereo weapon.
[126:55.82]I can hear this in the middle of my brain when I shoot it.
[127:12.09]Sniper, I'm standing still for you.
[127:14.50]I am the distractor.
[127:16.02]I'm medic.
[127:20.54]I switched to medic.
[127:21.26]It's me and backfield Huntsman guy.
[127:23.74]Everyone's overhealed.
[127:28.84]Alright, go get him.
[127:38.12]Oh, that's bad news.
[127:43.20]I didn't know they were coming up that far.
[127:45.90]Yeah, I get it, get it, get it.
[127:47.08]Sniper!
[127:48.58]Okay, I get it.
[127:49.88]I shouldn't have been up that far.
[127:53.38]That was stupid.
[127:56.45]That was bad news, Batchest.
[127:58.21]That was kind of a tuber voice, but we're playing TF2.
[128:00.31]That's the point.
[128:02.61]We're back, baby.
[128:03.57]We're back.
[128:14.84]I feel like I'm fishing.
[128:15.86]Alright, come on.
[128:20.84]Come on, Bloopo.
[128:21.80]Bloopo is going to win this for us right now.

[129:05.26]Alright.
[129:07.84]Come on, Bloopo.
[129:10.30]Come on, Bloopo.
[129:13.70]Bloopo's about to get on this.
[129:20.21]Get the fuck out of here.
[129:22.79]I got an Uber.
[129:27.27]It's publish time, let's go.
[129:37.88]Nice.
[129:40.02]Why does it take the announcer for this to happen?
[129:44.38]It does.
[129:50.00]Blupo, I'm telling you.
[129:51.55]No, Blupo, you're good.
[129:56.09]Is that the heater?
[129:58.65]That weapon's pretty cool.
[130:00.37]The anti-spy heavy gun.
[130:02.81]That thing's cool.
[130:06.41]Dude, just roll it.
[130:08.43]Just don't even stop.
[130:12.59]I'm sorry, Blupo.
[130:15.10]I got to spread it around.
[130:23.37]Use your anti spy gun.
[130:26.21]I had to use it.
[130:31.09]Sorry.
[130:33.95]Hey, that was a good push though.

[131:41.47]What changed?
[131:42.33]I think I'm talking a little louder because I can't hear myself talk.
[131:45.15]Maybe that's why I'm being louder today.
[131:49.12]I'm proud of you.
[131:50.18]Thanks.
[131:51.40]You're my little baby boo boo.
[131:52.46]I feel like I haven't seen you in a while.
[131:59.52]I was in the back line like all game doing absolutely nothing.
[132:10.04]I was having a good time.
[132:20.25]No, no, no, no.
[132:21.47]Don't let him do that.
[132:29.22]Where is it?

[132:46.60]Let's do it.
[132:47.55]Okay, 1, 2, 3, go.
[132:57.59]Why did you tell me to do that?
[132:59.12]We got the Sentry.
[133:00.36]Technically speaking.
[133:02.60]Actually, a net win.
[133:03.28]That's true.
[133:04.68]Yeah.
[133:05.08]Look, we're doing it.
[133:06.40]Oh, shit.
[133:06.78]That's actually true.
[133:07.40]Nice.
[133:11.64]Oh shit, it actually did work.
[133:14.91]We just inspired everybody.
[133:19.01]Holy shit, the whole clip just went into somebody.
[133:20.69]I just freaked somebody out so bad.
[133:36.46]Smash smash.
[133:37.65]I was never saying minus four.
[133:40.49]Whoa, you must have told a really bad joke.
[133:44.01]I've never even seen a minus 4 before.
[133:45.72]I don't know what happened.
[133:49.34]No, did you guys hear the... It just wasn't on screen.
[133:53.64]I looked away.
[133:58.46]I am not dying over there.
[134:01.64]Whoa, crit skrig.
[134:04.21]Whoa!
[134:05.55]What is going on?
[134:06.45]Okay, so when you were giving me shit for like, how come you're not screaming every time you die?
[134:09.75]But when I say, whoa, Kritskrig, that's for you to make a little joke?
[134:13.43]That's not a death noise.
[134:14.69]It's very different.
[134:17.87]We're being stupid down here.
[134:19.75]Turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around.
[134:22.55]You stopped healing me.
[134:23.27]That would have been so cool.
[134:29.11]Everyone would have thought it was cool if I did that.
[134:39.60]Somebody said, this feels like a bit.
[134:41.70]I think it's because me and Ster have not played this game for 10 fucking years on camera.
[134:47.03]I think that's probably why you feel that way.
[134:48.05]We're probably in separate games as well.
[134:49.55]I feel like we're doing entirely and completely different things like we're in two different games.
[134:57.25]I think we're doing fine.
[134:58.63]I got put into the ceiling.
[135:00.97]I mean...
[135:09.80]Oh, come on.
[135:12.12]Did that really just happen?
[135:17.48]Somebody shoot something.
[135:19.48]For goodness gracious.
[135:22.01]We need the Uber.
[135:23.53]I just have to try to stay alive longer.
[135:29.71]Medic?
[135:30.97]Want to build Uber?
[135:32.03]I'm coming.
[135:33.13]Medic?
[135:33.39]I can only run so fast.
[135:36.35]Bro.
[135:42.62]Oh yeah, I'm charging.
[135:44.52]I'm building Uber for you.
[135:47.18]You want to play a class that gets Uber?
[135:50.56]Or do you want to roll the dice?
[135:53.56]I got I get this direct hit soldier up here.
[135:55.34]Think I'm alright.
[135:58.99]The demo up here too.
[135:59.81]I think will be OK.
[136:01.07]Well, I almost got it.
[136:04.79]Do not as it's not.
[136:05.67]I'm going to get hit in the head if I show my face.
[136:13.08]Every time I see a heavy, they are seconds away from being backstabbed.
[136:17.50]I need to heal.
[136:17.96]I gotta heal.
[136:18.36]Alright, I'm ready to uber this soldier if they're still alive up here.
[136:27.06]Fuck!
[136:27.74]Oh my god, dude.
[136:29.15]I thought he killed them.
[136:31.05]I thought- See, he had like the pan kill and I was like, oh, he killed the guy.
[136:33.99]I didn't know there was like three people in the fucking corner.
[136:40.28]No, I'm bad.
[136:46.51]I saw the I saw the crit pan kill and I was like, oh nice, you got him.
[136:52.09]Fuck.
[137:00.40]Somebody up here now.
[137:01.06]Alright, get me out of the way.
[137:06.56]We're going to push an uber and we will eventually.
[137:09.86]They just critsed our front line.
[137:11.92]Our front line is down.
[137:16.64]Oh, my goodness.
[137:30.23]Oh, heavy.
[137:30.67]Peek this corner.
[137:31.87]Not you.
[137:36.82]You got dominated.
[137:39.76]Yeah, the guy was behind us.
[137:42.52]Turn around.
[137:44.37]I did.
[137:44.79]There was nobody there.
[137:45.37]And then I turned around again.
[137:46.29]There's a rocket in my face.
[137:48.99]Medic, we need you.
[137:51.17]Well, you need to keep the medic alive.
[137:52.69]And no one's doing that.
[137:53.59]You keep going on the flank.
[137:54.51]You're like down in the basement.
[137:55.93]No, you follow where the medic goes.
[137:57.76]The medic is the quarterback of Team Fortress.
[137:59.00]I haven't seen you.
[138:00.46]Well, you're playing sniper.
[138:02.40]Can you heal me?
[138:05.03]I'm the only medic on the goddamn team right now, alright?
[138:07.51]You're right next to me.
[138:08.39]You have to be like four times.
[138:10.63]Who takes priority?
[138:11.55]You didn't heal any of the other people either.
[138:14.39]Heavy or Sniper?
[138:15.67]Who takes priority?
[138:16.69]You weren't healing him.
[138:17.99]I was.
[138:24.17]Oh, no.
[138:24.45]You go get a health back.
[138:25.47]Blupo is going to carry again.
[138:27.18]Oh, God.
[138:27.60]He's dead.
[138:31.28]I got a noober right now.
[138:32.04]I got a noober right now.
[138:32.80]Go, go, go, go, go.
[138:33.56]Jump through, jump through.
[138:34.20]We're going, going, going.
[138:35.34]Go, go, go.
[138:36.70]Get in here, go.
[138:39.78]Don't even touch it.
[138:46.25]What, what, what?
[138:50.31]It's chaos.
[138:50.89]Go, go, go, go, go.
[138:51.57]Chaos, chaos.
[138:52.31]It's chaos time.
[138:55.60]You guys got to get this.
[138:57.98]Failure, failure, failure.
[139:01.65]leave you gotta leave now you're embarrassing me wait is there another round I left oh okay I left minus four what I got minus four I don't know why why are people saying that does that mean I think it means I don't know what did I eat four of today
[139:33.15]If you want to see just how far my gamer skill has fallen.
[139:37.62]I got 52 points with a spy in one life.
[139:41.86]I got like 60.
[139:42.74]That's not ever going to happen ever again.
[139:48.12]Oh, this is one of the new ones.
[139:49.70]You can definitely just go on TR walkway again.
[139:54.39]To get that the same way you got it the first time.
[139:57.51]No, no, no.
[139:58.01]I was very careful to make sure I didn't do that.
[140:00.76]Because I always wanted that to be accurate.
[140:03.26]Because when it happened, it was like, holy shit.
[140:05.34]And now you want to preserve it for life.
[140:10.08]I'm going to do... I'm going to go heavy with... Maybe just default minigun.
[140:24.65]I like the chocolate bar.
[140:27.47]And we'll do gloves.
[140:30.05]I like the chocolate bar.
[140:32.09]This thing is cool, but it's kind of distracting.
[140:33.35]You got a banana?
[140:36.34]I do.
[140:37.60]But chocolate's kind of fun because it gives you more max health.
[140:42.82]Banana got potassium.
[140:45.34]Bananas are great.
[140:50.29]I have no idea where I'm going.
[140:51.21]I think I'm going the right way.
[140:53.85]There's arrows.
[140:55.91]I bit my tongue a little bit.
[141:02.89]Alright, let's do it.
[141:08.01]Oh, they come out this way?
[141:09.11]Cool.
[141:18.97]Is there a spy?
[141:26.74]uh because they're cowards and they all died and they need to respawn and respawns take a while I even turned around I turned around looking looking for a spy and the second I turn my back I'm dead there's a spy coming by Dead Ringer spy Dead Ringer pirate spy pirate spy let's do the slow down instrumental version of that
[141:58.54]you just did the brown noise to me that was so bassy it really wasn't I mean my pants tell a different story what alright I honest to goodness honest to goodness what the fuck just happened there what happened I
[142:26.21]How am I going to run all the way back there?
[142:33.43]A lot of spies.
[142:36.71]There are.
[142:37.21]I get there, turn around to look for a spy, freak out for a second, spin my minigun and die.
[142:47.48]their team may have like four or five of them I knew it I knew he might not be dead yeah there's one behind
[143:25.01]sure is what's in my head I got 400 health oh can someone do the spy math how many ubers do they have it's it's it's this has to come down to like 1.2 it's way too high still
[143:58.78]Even lower.
[144:01.12]This has got to be like 1.1, 1.15.
[144:05.16]Do it.
[144:07.40]Get right.
[144:08.76]That's better, I think.
[144:11.14]Turn off the mouse.
[144:17.47]Mouse acceleration is on.
[144:20.49]It's off.
[144:35.03]I feel the love of God.
[144:36.06]Okay.
[144:37.40]He's here.
[144:38.82]He ain't dead.
[144:43.66]How did a heavy appear behind me?
[144:46.00]Ain't nobody killing me with a backstab now.
[144:52.61]My whole team's there.
[145:03.14]I'm going to be that pyro guy.
[145:04.86]There's just too many sprees.
[145:07.03]Can we get a director's cut of the spree video?
[145:13.43]Like what you were thinking, like a whole walkthrough.
[145:15.67]A whole walkthrough?
[145:18.80]Yeah, you can like slow it down and point stuff out that like maybe like you don't notice on your first watch.
[145:24.70]That spy is not one of us.
[145:43.69]I need ammo.
[145:49.81]Dude, he's too good.
[145:57.01]Ready to go.
[146:00.75]He's not dead.
[146:01.85]He's absolutely 100% still alive.
[146:13.86]Don't do it!
[146:14.30]I thought I was far enough away.
[146:19.07]Oh my, wait, was it the pyro?
[146:21.09]No, the pyro sprayed me.
[146:24.17]The pyro sprayed.
[146:29.27]Jesus.
[146:29.69]Gee whiz.
[146:31.56]It was the scout.
[146:36.38]Oh, he jumped up on the rock.
[146:37.86]Oh, that bastard.
[146:40.13]You played with the Dragon's Fury at all?
[146:43.71]That's the new Pyro one, right?
[146:45.49]The Pyro flamethrower.
[146:47.77]I looked at it, but I never really actually tried to use it.
[146:52.52]I've been enjoying it.
[146:55.30]I'm a Dragon's Fury appreciator.
[147:08.00]Come on.
[147:12.75]I scout?
[147:13.62]Okay, fine.
[147:23.66]It's a flare gun primary?
[147:27.98]Yeah, you don't actually hold a fire down.
[147:30.09]It's like a weird, like, projectile, isn't it?
[147:37.11]Okay.
[147:50.42]Turn your facecam on.
[147:51.97]I'll turn my facecam on for exactly 10 minutes next round.
[147:59.55]And I'll make sure to say, now we're doing it.
[148:01.31]Now we're doing it.

[148:59.93]I don't know the route.
[149:00.47]It is impossible to talk to you right now, by the way, dude.
[149:03.59]We're playing separate games and everything I say is just like, wait, wait, wait.
[149:08.57]Okay.
[149:09.05]Like you're so involved in the game.
[149:10.65]You're so interested about what's going on.
[149:12.06]I've kind of just given up.
[149:14.84]Alright.
[149:15.10]What did you just ask?
[149:16.00]Say it again.
[149:17.80]It doesn't matter.

[149:26.03]I'm just like, stuff is happening in the middle.
[149:27.83]You're answering them if in that exact moment you have like three seconds of attention span to give me your one word answer.
[149:34.16]Because I am 80, 80, 80, 80, 80.
[149:35.74]Oh, my God.

[150:50.13]I'm going to just grow it as long as it can go.
[150:51.45]I'm going to be as gross as possible.
[150:59.36]Alright.
[150:59.78]You guys get facecam for one round, but mine's like bigger than his is.
[151:02.20]It's fine.

[151:22.40]That's free points.
[151:26.56]That's free points.
[151:27.28]I'll take it.
[151:40.89]I actually really like this thing.
[151:41.91]I never use it though.
[151:46.11]Oops.

[152:40.08]Okay.
[152:40.38]People say my chin's cut off.
[152:44.06]It's fine.
[152:47.79]It's because the camera cut your chin off the cameras.
[152:52.11]I'll fix it in like a month.
[152:53.11]That's the whole point of a facecam to show your face.
[153:00.55]How long have you been streaming?
[153:03.35]How many years?
[153:05.85]I don't even, I don't even understand how this person keeps finding me.
[153:08.12]There's like an eight second delay.
[153:11.36]Alright.
[153:23.64]I'm going fucking psycho mode now.
[153:27.03]Oh yeah, you know, here it comes now.
[153:28.97]Same.
[153:30.23]You wanna do double flog pyro?
[153:32.64]I'm Dragon's Fury.
[153:34.16]I'm a Dragon's Fury enjoyer.
[153:49.59]Oh, my.
[153:50.63]Oh, nice spy checking, Pyro.
[153:53.25]I blew the fire on every single person.
[154:08.78]I wish they would make fall damage happen.
[154:10.66]Just like three feet higher or lower.
[154:15.36]You know what I'm saying?
[154:21.51]That's a backstab right there.
[154:28.39]Air's in my face.
[154:34.69]Help!
[154:36.49]Help!
[154:37.77]Help!
[154:39.13]Where'd the medic go?
[154:42.65]Ouch!
[154:43.25]Whoa!
[154:43.85]Where?
[154:44.17]From where?
[154:47.15]He did it!
[154:47.79]Health kit!
[155:08.43]We're good.
[155:21.84]Sniper, they're coming.
[155:24.07]How does he stay alive with 16 health?
[155:28.81]Because he had 16 health.
[155:40.98]Sometimes I forget that the fire projectiles, like, can kind of, you have to, like, move them around.
[155:46.00]Like, they're, like, almost, like, delayed if you try to track somebody.
[155:53.46]Are you... What?
[155:59.52]Serious?
[156:01.10]Yeah, sometimes it's, like, it's hard to get it, like, directly on their body if they're strafing around sometimes.
[156:06.44]That's Mei from Overwatch.
[156:14.27]Bye.
[156:15.07]I heard it.
[156:20.51]You are full of shit, Scout.
[156:25.83]He's right.
[156:26.41]They changed Pyro.
[156:32.01]They changed how all the flamethrowers work?
[156:34.53]What?
[156:34.91]Yeah, it's like you have to... The flame is its own like weird projectile that moves like trails.
[156:42.04]Oh, well, I only use the Dragon's Fury.
[156:45.01]Because I'm a Gygakid.
[156:52.75]Uh, I'm gonna put the shotgun on.
[156:54.47]Let's go shotgun time.
[156:58.09]I should play with the Degreaser, but I don't care.
[157:01.79]Uh, your audio got cut off, by the way.
[157:03.22]We didn't hear the cool song.
[157:04.98]Oh.
[157:16.14]Are we doing a funny hairstyle today?
[157:20.14]I don't think so.
[157:33.86]I hit him with like almost every shot from the shotgun.
[157:45.39]Just killed a hamster.
[157:52.36]I don't believe that he's dead.
[158:01.61]Oh God.
[158:27.53]The spy has almost 100 points, by the way.
[158:32.99]100?
[158:33.01]100?
[158:33.87]Yeah, because they feel bad for spy and they give him all those points.
[158:38.95]Don't you know one spy backstab is like 30 points?
[158:46.19]And ever since they nerfed the Dead Ringer, they're like, oh, I guess it's even harder now.
[158:49.37]I think it's like 40 points for backstab.
[158:56.36]The next person on the team has 38 points.
[158:58.21]That's freaking ludicrous, dude.
[159:05.95]I explained it.
[159:06.91]I know.
[159:08.39]Can someone push the cart?
[159:09.39]I'm going to try to get on it.
[159:11.03]I've noticed this is one of those maps where no one touches the cart at the end here because they think someone's going to stop them and then they don't.
[159:22.90]See?
[159:25.89]That's two for two right there.
[159:31.46]Ow.
[159:34.50]Spy check mania?
[159:36.46]Kind of what I'm doing right now.
[159:37.98]The only thing I can do.
[160:11.65]Alright, we're on it.
[160:20.47]He still killed me!
[160:22.85]This thing sucks, doesn't it?
[160:26.29]Should I use this thing?
[160:35.93]I feel like the sound effect was even like lower.
[160:47.18]It's like a
[161:10.61]oh fire axe is even worse uh I gotta read all the items again everything seems to be changed so so differently that's cool though I'm happy about it it's like a whole nother game to explore that's cool
[161:39.75]You gotta read them first.
[161:42.75]Why was that guy just 100 miles per hour?
[161:44.17]That was weird.
[161:45.43]Dude, is he still alive?
[162:00.10]What the fuck?
[162:00.82]He is still alive.
[162:01.58]Bum bum bum bum bum.
[162:12.98]That's a difference you buy, huh?
[162:13.76]I thought it was the same guy.
[162:17.38]Why is that Pyro there?
[162:20.86]It's not me.
[162:21.10]It's me.
[162:23.28]Literally me.
[162:26.56]Can you not light on fire?
[162:27.08]What was that?
[162:29.16]I think he's dead.
[162:36.66]No!
[162:55.66]No! He's still alive.
[162:59.47]Dude does the Deadringer make you like not get hit by fire or something?
[162:53.47]Why- why how come I couldn't do it?
[163:04.47]It does extinguish you and then you have to light them on fire again. If I'm not mistaken.
[163:10.47]Because I felt like he died, but then was invisible. I lit him on fire, and then it went off of him? Spy-cicle?
[163:16.47]Uh you could also use the Spy-cicle but that makes a noise.
[163:18.47]Oh, right. Okay.
[163:26.85]It melts this bicycle though, right?
[163:28.45]At the same time?
[163:29.23]Yep, it does.
[163:43.19]That was a good fucking shot, Jesus.
[163:45.63]It literally was falling down.
[164:04.83]It's me, I promise.
[164:07.01]Okay, the enemy team's like right up here.
[164:08.73]There's a health kit, but they're going to look at you because this is their spawn.
[164:14.06]Did you get the health kit?
[164:15.64]I'm not there.
[164:18.62]I think that's a spy you're looking at.
[164:22.62]That's not your name.
[164:24.36]No, it was an engineer with me, and then you looked straight in my face and said, this is me, I promise.
[164:29.13]And I fucking believed you.
[164:30.81]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[164:31.65]You're an engineer.
[164:33.49]I'm a pyro.
[164:34.53]Oh, wait, what?
[164:40.47]There was an engineer in the side room with a sentry, and I walked up to him, and I was like, oh shit, because he was shooting me, he thought I was a spy, so I was just like, I'm real.
[164:47.93]Were you in the middle of also a separate, exact same?
[164:50.76]I was a pyro, and like a damaged engineer was walking around the corner, and he stopped and stared at me as you said that.
[164:56.88]And was like, don't, like, you were like, oh, don't worry, it's me.
[164:59.20]And I was like, oh, cool, it's you.
[165:02.34]Were they good enough or is webcam time over?
[165:05.16]They're being good.
[165:05.90]I keep it on.
[165:08.00]Another round.
[165:08.36]My chat was bad.
[165:09.58]Were they bad?
[165:10.74]My chat was being very bad.
[165:12.22]What the heck?
[165:15.49]What's going on here, guys?
[165:18.41]Alright, fine.
[165:18.87]I'll do it too.
[165:20.95]Is there enough time for me to pee?
[165:25.15]Uh, yeah.
[165:25.79]Let's all pee.
[165:26.79]Let's actually leave the game.
[165:27.91]Okay.
[165:28.75]And let's do a little pee break.
[165:30.57]Okay.
[165:34.00]Alright, we're back.
[167:12.11]I am back.
[167:14.01]Are you also here?
[167:17.33]How are you?
[167:20.09]How's it going?
[167:23.29]Oh, he's not here.
[167:27.47]That was quick.
[167:29.15]Yeah, I mean, he's usually pretty quick.
[167:30.79]So that's why I'm
[167:34.76]You're usually pretty slow, so I took my time.
[167:37.08]That's what I mean.
[167:37.50]I was trying to... You're usually pretty fast, so I was trying to match your time.
[167:41.66]I'm like a fire hose.
[167:44.56]He's seen it.
[167:47.26]You ready?
[167:48.79]Wait, what?
[167:49.81]Alright, let's go.
[167:50.85]You ready to queue up?
[167:52.63]Yeah.
[167:55.19]I'm going to keep my facecam on because they were good.
[167:57.93]They were good.
[167:58.61]That spy was very good.
[168:02.73]Wait, did you mean good at the game or good in chat?
[168:05.15]Probably both.
[168:13.39]Where's the game?
[168:16.71]There it is.
[168:17.57]We're joining.
[168:22.21]Very cool.
[168:25.23]Epic.
[168:27.61]There were like three spies trying to kill you.
[168:29.79]What's your most played time class?
[168:31.04]It's the way it is.
[168:32.02]It's fine.
[168:33.56]I think it's spy, honestly.
[168:35.26]Either spy or engineer.
[168:39.78]That was loud.
[168:40.46]Is this the same one we were just in?
[168:42.92]I don't think so.
[168:44.92]No.
[168:49.15]No.
[168:52.51]I have a way better version of this.
[168:54.19]Yeah, I got a factory new one of these things.
[168:57.95]Let's put it on.
[168:59.93]Ooh.
[169:01.39]There we go.
[169:01.85]That's way better.
[169:03.12]Getting a little spicy.
[169:04.28]Just a little.
[169:11.73]I'm going to scout around town.
[169:24.24]They're not moving.
[169:25.42]Okay, he became aware.
[169:27.49]He did the U-Strap on Heavy.
[169:29.87]You just pretend you're not there.
[169:31.17]You have a Gibbous on.
[169:32.01]You don't know what's going on.
[169:33.81]And then you just awaken.
[169:47.13]He's probably still alive.
[169:48.49]Why are you doing that?
[169:50.11]Why are you being weird?
[169:50.59]Why are you being weird?
[169:51.77]Me?
[169:52.01]That spy.
[170:04.06]you are there's no way um sorry you're alive still there's no way you know I think you might be the most attractive streamer on this website thank you I guess anyone else agree it's not just me right
[170:32.70]No, I... I don't know about that.
[170:39.68]Well, like, who else?
[170:40.66]Who beats you?
[170:41.22]I don't know.
[170:47.92]Okay.
[170:48.24]That's why...
[171:12.41]Ah, a nice movement heavy.
[171:13.85]That was actually good.
[171:17.00]Same guy.
[171:18.08]I'll leave him alone.
[171:18.68]He doesn't know what's going on.
[171:19.44]I don't want him to enjoy the game.
[171:24.26]I knew there was going to be a spy.
[171:28.28]You should have your ego inflated.
[171:29.36]I don't... Look, I'm on a webcam.
[171:32.77]That's like 480p.
[171:35.15]The room is dark.
[171:37.29]You look really good when I have to squint.
[171:40.34]But I don't... The blurriness just adds to the mystique.
[171:48.92]Well, I appreciate that, but... That's a spy right there.
[171:55.17]There's a spy right here.
[171:58.43]You can't get a better webcam?
[172:00.83]I don't want a better webcam.
[172:03.88]Why not?
[172:04.58]Because then people will just see, like, my fucked up face.
[172:08.66]Your pores?
[172:09.66]Yeah, I don't want people to look.
[172:10.74]Oh, man, it's in, like, 4K.
[172:12.18]No, fuck, don't look at me.
[172:13.26]Fuck off.
[172:13.64]I don't want you to look at my 4K face.
[172:16.25]Like, who wants that?
[172:17.55]I don't want that.
[172:18.43]There's a lot of people looking at your face right now.
[172:20.33]Yeah, but it's, like, in 480p.
[172:21.43]It's different.
[172:24.79]That was weird.
[172:31.82]Look at me!
[172:39.46]Well, we're doing it.
[172:47.26]You've heard of like a. Something called the responsibility of a 10.
[172:56.86]I have no idea what you're going with on this.
[173:02.18]It is your responsibility as a 10 out of 10 man.
[173:06.64]To just.
[173:08.88]Reproduce.
[173:10.88]And to give as many people an opportunity to be with you as possible.
[173:19.78]What the fuck?
[173:22.04]Heavy is the head that wears the crown.
[173:28.43]That's so fucking insane.
[173:29.85]Dude, I can't even play the game right now.
[173:33.51]That was so fucked up, I can't even fucking talk.
[173:40.25]What do you mean?
[173:41.77]I'm trying to snipe.
[173:45.63]Do it.
[173:48.45]I just heard... That means there's a spy right here.
[174:03.84]Oh, I see it now.
[174:05.66]Oh!
[174:07.26]There's a secret sentry up there.
[174:09.52]Oh, nose.
[174:12.30]Oh, nose.
[174:13.48]No, my nose was itchy.
[174:15.36]Oh.

[174:18.94]He's not dead.
[174:19.62]He's not dead.
[174:20.20]He's not dead.
[174:20.74]He's coming for me again.
[174:29.87]Finally.
[174:30.47]Come on, make it happen, Jeremy.
[174:35.12]You really need to make it happen.
[174:41.17]Dude, he's going sicko mode with the Wrangler.
[174:43.97]He actually kind of is.
[174:45.97]He's killing everybody.
[174:50.27]Say thank you, you ungrateful fuck.
[174:54.74]What do you mean?
[174:55.96]Didn't I say thanks?
[174:57.00]Are you talking about the 10 out of 10 thing you're saying?
[175:00.38]I said thank you.
[175:01.16]I don't know what to say.
[175:01.96]I don't know what to say about that.
[175:07.32]It's fine.
[175:08.36]He doesn't have to say thank you.
[175:11.79]Am I going the... Don't tell anybody I went the wrong way.
[175:18.67]Don't tell anybody I went the wrong way.
[175:20.55]They'll think I'm an idiot.
[175:23.98]You can't do that.
[175:27.10]Nah, uh-uh.
[175:28.88]Don't you dare trick stab me.
[175:29.86]You're gonna jump off a fucking rock.
[175:34.64]Somebody help me!
[175:44.77]so bad I it's a spy and he's a revolver and I have to get it takes me two and a half seconds to shoot him what was that supposed to mean huh what was that supposed to mean I'm really bad at spy is what that meant listen Jerma if you're not ready to accept compliments I want your chat to know that that's fine not everyone is like I'm not good at receiving compliments but
[176:12.06]You know, you got to hear him more.
[176:14.20]Does your chat let you know how fucking sexy you are?
[176:24.07]Now what?
[176:24.69]Now you're laughing about it?
[176:29.47]Yeah.
[176:32.69]Well, we're just bros being bros.
[176:34.02]Like, bros can't compliment each other.
[176:35.66]Like, dude.
[176:37.42]What's the problem?
[176:38.40]What's the fuck?
[176:38.94]What the fuck?
[176:42.63]Alright, I'm going lock and load.
[176:46.57]Lock and load.
[176:58.75]Sick.
[176:59.45]Let's go.
[177:05.71]This has three shots now?
[177:07.15]Wait, I feel like that was...
[177:11.32]They're like little balls.
[177:12.56]Hold on.
[177:12.94]What does this weapon do now?
[177:15.51]What weapon?
[177:16.39]The lock and load?
[177:19.27]It used to be cylinders.
[177:21.93]Now it's like these little balls.
[177:23.11]Projectile speed, damage versus buildings.
[177:26.70]I think they just made it a little worse.
[177:31.40]It sucks now.
[177:33.44]It was always three?
[177:34.42]I just thought it was two for some reason.
[177:37.20]I believe it always was three, even though it has two slots.
[177:41.84]Oh, that's probably what it is.
[177:44.52]But I do remember it also having like a crazy damage bonus that doesn't seem to have.
[177:48.20]No, it was two.
[177:52.11]It was.
[177:52.41]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[177:52.93]I think it was two at release and then they buffed it and then it was like, why is it three?
[177:56.03]There's only two shots, but it sounds different, too.
[177:58.41]I think I remember there being something with that.
[178:03.23]Compliment Ster back.
[178:04.30]I was Ster.
[178:05.32]You have very handsome beard.
[178:07.80]Thank you.
[178:08.88]It hides my face.
[178:09.64]It's not what I meant.
[178:15.80]I know.
[178:19.38]But if I didn't have it, then you'd be able to see my mandibles.
[178:22.29]And you've been very physically fit recently.
[178:25.11]Really kind of taking your health very seriously.
[178:26.85]That's good too.
[178:28.13]I have not.
[178:32.17]See, I'm not good at taking compliments either.
[178:33.59]Apparently not.
[178:34.83]See, it's hard.
[178:36.23]Yeah.
[178:46.17]Alright, they're probably going to go the other way now.
[178:51.11]The other way?
[178:51.73]They gotta come this way.
[178:53.21]They gotta come this way.
[179:03.86]Ooh, okay.
[179:04.56]They're coming up.
[179:06.50]Wait, can I go in there?
[179:11.72]Cat's being bad.
[179:12.41]You should turn facecam off.
[179:13.87]Um...
[179:24.67]I want to be the swordsman!
[179:26.77]I want it now!
[179:31.90]I'm going to switch to medic in a little bit and I'm going to give you some crits, I think.
[179:36.18]What are you playing as?
[179:38.44]Demo you.
[179:42.48]There's no way he's dead.
[179:44.15]I'm playing the Swordsman.
[179:45.59]Wait, you wanted to give crits?
[179:47.45]I knew he was dead, too.
[179:49.25]Is that a different spy?
[179:50.87]Hello?
[179:51.75]Yes, I want to give you crits.
[179:54.35]Oh, goodness.
[179:57.63]I was paying a lot of attention.
[180:03.03]This one's me.
[180:06.67]Have you heard the Liberty Launcher is the best gun in the game?
[180:10.31]I have heard some theories about it.
[180:13.66]Do you disagree with those theories?
[180:16.10]I trust your theories because I feel like you know kind of what you're talking about.
[180:20.01]That's a Medica spy.
[180:22.09]Yep.
[180:31.31]Oh, fuck.
[180:33.21]God damn it.
[180:33.88]They came in with an Uber too.
[180:36.00]Yeah, Ubers are kind of cheating.
[180:45.96]Oh shit, how are we going to lose with Jormungandr on our team?
[180:53.63]Holy shit, the whole team was dead.
[180:55.45]We all just came out at the same time.
[181:03.47]Oh my God.
[181:04.71]You just run.
[181:05.33]OK, I'm worried about I wanted to save the it was a it was OK.
[181:10.31]What the fuck?
[181:11.15]That's a. Do you want to give me the crits or do you want to run down and try and melee pyros?
[181:16.08]I was the guy was running away was trying to heal him.
[181:28.16]I was depending on you.
[181:30.41]I almost have it.
[181:31.89]And your goldfish brain activated.
[181:34.35]There are 10 people on the team.
[181:36.35]Alright, I got it.
[181:42.25]Where are you?
[181:42.89]Press E. Fuck you!
[181:46.53]Where are you?
[181:46.93]Press E!
[181:51.49]Ah!
[181:51.63]I heard a spy.
[181:53.68]Keep going.
[181:54.16]Keep going.
[182:08.12]Nice.
[182:09.50]Oh, alright.
[182:10.00]We did.
[182:10.30]We did good.
[182:10.66]We did good.
[182:11.32]We got it.
[182:11.62]We got it.
[182:12.47]We did good.
[182:13.43]I think I forced it.
[182:14.21]There weren't a lot of people.
[182:18.01]But I guess we did kill people.
[182:19.37]So we did kill people.
[182:21.75]They got a teleporter behind us.
[182:33.15]I got to go do this.
[182:34.13]I got to go handle it.
[182:35.17]Okay.
[182:36.60]I will be back here.
[182:38.97]I mean, you can come with.
[182:40.51]Well, people who need help over here are bad.
[182:52.16]The guy who came up with the Dead Ringer?
[182:57.06]Dead Ringer's not that big of a problem.
[182:59.06]I think it's the Dead Ringer-spicycle combo, potentially, because you can get out of a lot.
[183:05.22]Jesus.
[183:09.87]back in my day if you're if you died you died if you're consistent and like I mean once I started really oh no yeah delete spy from the game yeah I agree see what what what
[183:34.34]No, if you start to pay attention to good spies, I don't think he's dead.
[183:43.20]Somebody has to be constantly paying attention.
[183:46.63]Just constantly.
[183:48.29]If there's a really good spy on the team.
[183:52.53]God, I can't.
[183:54.40]But what if they make a mistake?
[183:55.68]Shouldn't they die?
[184:03.02]Didn't they nerf the Dead Ringer really, really bad at some point, like in 2015 or 2016?
[184:08.00]Yeah, but shouldn't they have done it four times?
[184:12.24]I remember there was a pretty massive... They made it loud, much louder, right?
[184:19.15]I haven't maybe I'll play with it see you that's a spy you're literally dude you're literally me there's three of you this okay now I don't I think the problem is the spies that are on the other team are like they're just there's like five of them one of them was me
[185:01.06]I'm being extra paranoid.
[185:04.62]Don't you think it's weird?
[185:05.54]Alright, we're getting a little too far up here.
[185:20.87]This is kind of scary.
[185:22.47]This is scary.
[185:23.19]We don't have crits yet.
[185:24.09]This is scary what we're doing.
[185:26.30]Well, it looks like we're doing... I'm with you.
[185:27.20]I'm behind you.
[185:27.52]I'm behind you.
[185:28.88]Along with spy number 16.
[185:29.98]I think he's still alive.
[185:34.34]Yeah.
[185:34.62]Watch out.
[185:34.84]Watch out.
[185:35.04]Watch out.
[185:35.24]I don't know who's who.
[185:37.37]Me neither.
[185:37.97]Let's walk forward.
[185:38.63]Come with me.
[185:38.91]Come with me.
[185:39.17]Wait.
[185:39.27]Wait.
[185:39.37]I need to heal this barrow.
[185:40.19]Come on.
[185:40.41]No, you don't.
[185:40.91]Yes, I do.
[185:41.47]I'm a team player.
[185:42.17]You're going to get back.
[185:45.09]He's not dead.
[185:48.67]Do you want it?
[185:49.64]There's people everywhere, dude.
[185:51.70]Do you want it or not?
[185:52.77]No, no.
[185:53.55]Am I screaming?
[185:54.39]I did scare the shit out of me.
[185:58.33]I thought it was going to die.
[185:59.21]I have no ammo.
[186:04.79]If I die because of this, I would be pissed.
[186:11.69]Just keep yourself busy.
[186:13.02]Keep yourself busy, honey.
[186:18.96]Here's an iPad.
[186:19.70]Oh, iPad.
[186:20.70]Come with me.
[186:25.12]I don't know if you could guess, but there was a guy behind us.
[186:30.86]Is TF2 on iPad?
[186:34.20]That would actually be pretty lit.
[186:55.97]Would it?
[186:59.11]No, will you get out of here?
[187:01.27]Get out of here.
[187:02.03]You give your little Billy give little.
[187:05.95]Oh God, that guy should be dead.
[187:08.27]Alright, I must have some comments for you if you want some.
[187:17.21]I'm coming.
[187:21.88]I'm dead.
[187:26.52]Give it to someone else.
[187:27.54]I'm about to.
[187:28.64]Why is this thing not charging?
[187:33.57]Come on, Heavy.
[187:34.13]Go for it.
[187:36.93]No.
[187:39.77]No.
[187:40.93]No.
[187:41.31]How many are there?
[187:41.89]Two?
[187:43.74]Dude, how many people does it take to kill one spy?
[187:45.54]That was like 11 people versus one guy.
[187:47.56]Alright, we're good.
[187:50.40]How much damage reduction does the Deadbringer give?
[187:55.88]I don't know.
[187:57.14]I think it's like 90%.
[187:58.52]Let's leave.
[187:58.92]Okay.
[188:06.94]Okay.
[188:09.18]Ops score.
[188:10.28]Did I get a top score?
[188:11.28]I don't think so.
[188:17.16]It doesn't even say on the item.
[188:23.98]I didn't... This is cool.
[188:25.92]Allows you to see enemy health.
[188:27.96]65% damage reduction?
[188:36.36]Lame.
[188:37.46]Collect the organs of people you hit with the Vita-Saw?
[188:40.50]What was this before?
[188:41.42]Oh no, it looks like it's still the same.
[188:51.48]Wait, that's actually kind of good.
[188:55.87]What is organs?
[188:57.51]I don't know.
[188:58.27]So, this is the one that keeps Uber if you're dead.
[189:00.75]Like, you get to keep a certain percent.
[189:03.82]So, percentage of your Uber charge level is retained on death based on the number of organs harvested, 15% per.
[189:08.96]And it caps out at 60.
[189:11.00]I think you have to hit people with it, though.
[189:18.47]Minus 10 health.
[189:23.13]If you're going to hit people, you might as well hit them with you.
[189:24.67]Oh, my God.
[189:25.33]That's true.
[189:25.79]You want to play Phoenix again?
[189:28.42]Oh, I don't mind.
[189:29.30]No, I'm leaving.
[189:31.70]I want a different thing.
[189:33.24]I'll take it off the list.
[189:34.26]Okay.
[189:36.88]I am out.
[189:46.49]That's startling, don't do that.
[189:50.11]Let's play some, like, classic ones.
[189:51.45]Let's go to, like...
[189:53.46]Oh, like Nucleus.
[189:54.96]Or Harvest, right?
[189:57.84]Or... Badwater.
[190:00.00]When was the last time we were at Badwater?
[190:03.88]Uh, an hour ago.
[190:05.24]Yeah, it's been a while.
[190:12.57]Okay.
[190:16.95]Sawmill?
[190:17.47]Yeah, Sawmill's a good one too.
[190:20.17]I don't think I want to play 2 for it.
[190:21.90]Maybe not yet.
[190:22.84]Undermountain?
[190:24.33]Thunder Mountain's a good one.
[190:24.97]Brazil?
[190:25.65]You want to play Brazil?
[190:26.41]I want to go to Thunder Mountain.
[190:30.34]Okay.
[190:40.15]Oh, ready to go to Thunder?
[190:41.31]Oh, here's the Thunder because he lays down that lumber or something.
[190:49.17]Ooh, Frontier.
[190:49.97]Cool.
[190:53.42]Shout out from the mountaintops, baby.
[190:54.90]Thunder Mountain.
[190:57.44]Server is changing level.
[191:00.48]Wait, it actually is.
[191:04.34]Yeah, a lot of the time when you casual queue, you'll get into a game at the end of the game because that's when everyone leaves to find a good game.
[191:09.81]But if you... You know, you see what I'm saying?
[191:12.03]I kind of hope it's going to Egypt.
[191:14.81]Oh, God.
[191:15.11]I played Egypt the other day.
[191:17.41]Once was enough.
[191:18.93]Alright, let's... Let me...
[191:23.85]Let me do something here.
[191:33.13]Soldier has a lot of cool weapons.
[191:38.37]Let's just go default.
[191:39.51]Default rocket launcher.
[191:41.66]Soldier has a lot of cool weapons.
[191:44.20]I will use none of them.
[191:51.52]Equip the pen.
[191:56.27]This brings me back to like 2011, 2012.
[192:02.30]My biggest nostalgia map turned out to be Snakewater.
[192:06.92]Yeah.
[192:10.42]Snakewater... What was the one that it was two payloads that had to cross each other?
[192:14.38]You each had a pushmon.
[192:16.70]There's Hightower.
[192:19.07]That one is... The one that they cross paths.
[192:23.37]I've been trying to remember the name of that one too.
[192:26.69]Not Hightower.
[192:27.23]Yeah, it was Payload Race.
[192:30.05]Pipeline, yep.
[192:31.25]Yep, Pipeline.
[192:32.27]That place sucked ass, but it was so fun to play.
[192:36.39]That's not what I expected you to say.
[192:38.48]I mean, that place was fucking awful.
[192:39.76]Oh yeah, Pipeline, that fucking... Yeah, but it was a ton of fun to play, but that place was just a mess.
[192:48.58]When the two carts were in the middle together, it was just a mess.
[193:02.99]The enemy team comes from up here where you're looking.
[193:07.09]That's the enemy team spawn.
[193:10.47]They're going to want to back up because they come out in 10 seconds.
[193:14.15]I know what I'm doing.
[193:15.65]And they are going to come out with an Uber.
[193:17.61]Good.
[193:19.27]For those of you who haven't seen this game before, an Uber makes them invulnerable and a medic gets it after a certain amount of charge.
[193:25.04]It's an ultimate ability.
[193:30.26]That didn't...
[193:44.48]A spy is a spy.
[193:53.69]Get him dishwasher.
[194:04.45]Go, go, go, quick, quick.
[194:07.82]That guy's good.
[194:14.05]Don't you... He's not dead.
[194:22.30]Oh shit, the Engineer died.
[194:24.56]I'm gonna stand in front of the fucking thing.
[194:26.78]I'm literally gonna tank any damage.
[194:32.82]I'm using my body to make sure there's nobody here who hurts this.
[194:36.82]Oh, man.
[194:37.12]I don't even care if I die.
[194:37.84]Tell me more.
[194:38.36]Tell me what you're doing with your body.
[194:39.64]Alright, he's back.
[194:40.36]Dude, this fucking spy.
[194:50.37]Your health seems low.
[194:51.59]Do you want a medic?
[194:53.27]Um, maybe.
[194:54.45]There's a dispenser.
[194:55.87]We have no medics.
[194:56.97]Oh, shit.
[194:57.35]I'm going to come heal you.
[194:58.38]Okay.
[195:05.84]Oh, you've got this, pal.
[195:08.56]There's a demo in the hallway.
[195:10.06]I'm dead.
[195:11.96]I'm dead, too.
[195:14.42]Gotta watch out for those.
[195:15.22]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[195:36.54]I don't even... Oh, he's up there.
[195:47.27]Honestly, who's your favorite character from World of Warcraft?
[195:56.48]That's a good question, dude.
[195:58.90]That takes... Hold on.
[196:00.28]I got a minute because I'm dead.
[196:02.98]Who's the best character from World of Warcraft?
[196:05.38]your favorite not the best the best is obviously sylvanas she's so powerful and so relevant all the time um this is gonna be a stupid answer but I don't know if it is or not uh I got shot in the chest by a this this spy is like a 14 kill streak am I gonna go pyro again just hold the button down in a circle
[196:28.55]I mean, no one is even like, I just watched like three people in a row actually AFK standing still that he stabbed.
[196:35.73]There's not much threat.
[196:39.59]Kel'thuzad.
[196:41.05]Either Kel'thuzad or Kael'thas.
[196:44.19]There you go.
[196:45.07]Why is Kel'thuzad your favorite or Kael'thas?
[196:47.39]Because they're like, I don't know, they're kind of like, they're goofy.
[196:51.03]And Kel'thuzad is like, I need more power!
[196:53.45]Give me the mana!
[196:54.35]More mana!
[196:55.43]Like he, I don't know, he's cool.
[196:57.05]To build sentries with?
[196:58.65]Yeah.
[197:00.89]I got the crits.
[197:02.45]Frank, let's go, Frank.
[197:03.31]Alright, I'll tell you when to do it.
[197:05.10]Ready?
[197:06.84]And... Activate!
[197:11.00]Why did you not do it?
[197:12.08]I told you to do it!
[197:13.28]What are you doing?
[197:15.00]I just told you to activate, and you didn't do it.
[197:17.16]I gotta hit the fucking head.
[197:17.86]I don't know what activate means.
[197:21.42]Why did you not do it?
[197:23.20]Why don't you scream?
[197:30.31]I guess you're right.
[197:30.93]I didn't scream.
[197:34.03]Well, there goes another crit.
[197:35.59]Just totally wasted.
[197:38.66]I died.
[197:40.14]We probably would have killed at least three people.
[197:43.72]Yeah, I bet.
[197:44.20]If only you had just screamed.
[197:50.74]Well, that's your activation, not mine.
[197:53.05]Yeah, and I'm the medic and I want my activation.
[197:58.91]I get to call the shots.
[198:01.62]The medic has the power.
[198:04.44]You never knew that.
[198:05.64]There's somebody.
[198:06.20]There's a spy.
[198:07.64]They're all behind us.
[198:10.90]What the fuck?
[198:14.74]It really has just been all spies.
[198:18.34]Every game.
[198:26.93]I have one health.
[198:33.72]I got the crits where's papa papa I'm coming I'm coming I'm coming I don't trust it but who knows okay alright not yet
[199:02.09]Uh-huh.
[199:02.87]I'll know the signal.
[199:12.64]Dude, I don't play this game.
[199:14.00]I don't play this game that often.
[199:15.08]Don't ever do that again.
[199:20.00]Jerma, I've got the crits.
[199:20.87]Where are you?
[199:25.91]Damn it.
[199:30.20]They were also spread out and I was so paranoid I was going to get backstabbed.
[199:37.67]Well, you know what they say.
[199:38.61]Your responsibility is a 10.
[199:42.81]Oh.
[199:42.89]Oh.
[200:03.00]I'm going to change to... God, I don't know.
[200:06.62]Equip the pan.
[200:07.48]Equip the pan.
[200:08.40]Heavy seems like a really stupid idea right now because it's just spies.
[200:11.36]It does.
[200:11.96]Just circling us like... Don't do it.
[200:14.68]Don't do it.
[200:15.22]I'm going to use... Don't do it.
[200:16.22]I'm going to do the heater.
[200:18.06]Oh my goodness.
[200:19.28]They ain't going to fucking get near us now.
[200:21.90]He's brilliant.
[200:23.14]They won't simply just walk through it and then never, ever, ever die.
[200:37.95]They are.
[200:38.25]I need, I need mana.
[200:57.50]Don't backstab me.
[200:58.10]Don't backstab me.
[200:58.63]Don't backstab me, please.
[201:01.39]Why would you eat it into the wall?
[201:10.71]Did I just get crit?
[201:11.85]Was it a random crit?
[201:13.99]Yup, and then I turned around and there was a spy.
[201:16.14]There's a spy.
[201:16.78]There's a spy.
[201:17.36]There's a spy.
[201:17.94]There's a spy.
[201:18.52]There's a spy.
[201:19.68]There's a spy.
[201:20.92]There's a spy.
[201:22.18]There's a spy.
[201:23.14]Are there any other classes in this game?
[201:27.86]We're fine.
[201:29.87]I spawned a new spy.
[201:31.85]We're fine.
[201:32.59]Demo and clear left.
[201:47.86]oh my god I even was looking around for him I'm surrounded by fire what the hell happened there they can still stab you if you're surrounded by fire that deals three damage yeah but he shouldn't they light on fire I thought that was the whole point it's not constant like there's there's like pulses they can get in between the pulse it's all that coming
[202:32.07]I'll take care of it.
[202:34.23]Got him.
[202:36.87]Thanks Frank the tank.
[202:50.27]That person's item says, hey, star, like I'm going to kill your head or something.
[202:54.61]That's a threat I can sue.
[202:57.21]How did they?
[203:05.30]Can't kill my head.
[203:13.72]Nobody mess around here.
[203:15.48]You want to quit or who are you?
[203:17.12]I'm a pyro.
[203:17.82]I don't think it's a good idea.
[203:19.31]I think it's a great idea.
[203:25.75]But where are you?
[203:27.51]Um, dead at the moment.
[203:36.64]I'm going to see Barbie tonight.
[203:38.38]Nice.
[203:41.40]Let's watch Barbie together.
[203:42.48]You could if you really wanted to.
[203:51.97]Does Vegas have like a giganto theater where you can buy out the whole thing and it can just be us in it?
[204:00.06]Why would you want to do that?
[204:01.62]Because no one will see us hold hands.
[204:07.34]Let's go.
[204:08.44]Let's go.
[204:08.90]Go, go, go, go, go.
[204:12.86]I just got crit by that shotgun.
[204:14.52]God damn it.
[204:18.98]They kind of just get them.
[204:20.94]That's so funny.
[204:25.26]I was dead anyways though, it's alright.
[204:46.61]Oh shit, at least I helped his dead body apparently.
[204:50.41]Yeah, thank you Frank.
[204:52.59]I'm really going to just start calling you Frank a lot.
[204:55.11]That's fine.
[204:59.55]Yeah, I know the streamer like that.
[205:01.41]I can call him by his first name.
[205:05.40]What is it?
[205:07.32]Okay, did we get him?
[205:08.18]I don't think we got a big deal or anything to me, though.
[205:11.78]Frank.
[205:15.11]Not doing bad.
[205:15.65]We're doing fine.
[205:20.36]I'm dead.
[205:20.92]I don't want to play medic anymore.
[205:23.60]You know what I mean?
[205:26.40]You ever just reach your limits?
[205:32.48]What the fuck?
[205:42.92]Watch that door.
[205:43.54]I'm watching it.
[205:50.77]I need ammo.
[205:51.09]Is there a dispenser over here?
[206:00.77]Oh.
[206:02.59]I need a dispenser.
[206:03.21]Where's the dispenser?
[206:06.16]I need a dispenser.
[206:09.90]There are other sources of ammo.
[206:12.74]I know.
[206:13.02]I got it.
[206:19.70]that's a lot of pyros that's a lot of uber that's the biggest piss I've ever taken four men come on come on come on I haven't hit anyone with this
[206:49.35]Are you using the pen?
[206:51.35]The pen?
[206:53.57]Are you actually using it?
[206:54.39]The what?
[206:56.97]The pen.
[206:58.58]I put the pen.
[207:01.88]Please, Jerma.
[207:04.40]I will before the stream ends.
[207:17.50]Help!
[207:21.47]Help.
[207:28.18]I'm going to hit someone.
[207:33.36]Just wait.
[207:34.92]I feel like I haven't been hitting anybody either.
[207:43.10]Wait, this is a bunch of ammo down here, isn't there?
[207:47.86]Full box, yes.
[207:50.42]Do you know that when you kill people, they drop ammo boxes?
[207:53.46]I have to kill them though.
[207:55.18]I want to be sure to have the sure thing.
[208:03.62]Just letting you know, not a lot of people have played this game.
[208:09.24]No one really knows what's going on right now.
[208:12.52]We could explain it.
[208:13.18]Do you really?
[208:13.70]We should.
[208:14.06]You want to do like a class in TF2?
[208:17.74]Sure.
[208:18.04]You want to be the teacher?
[208:19.48]Well...

[208:48.78]What am I doing?
[208:56.38]I'm fine.
[209:05.35]I kind of cracked out a little.
[209:06.95]You're kind of cracking a little bit.
[209:08.95]Your skin's kind of cracking.
[209:16.96]I'm going for at least number three on the scoreboard this round.
[209:22.16]Or honorary mention.
[209:27.44]Where the fuck did he just... What is... Wait, what's going on up there?
[209:33.08]Should I stop doing that?
[209:34.04]Oh, they're having fun.
[209:34.76]Okay, never mind.
[209:44.23]This sniper... This sniper...
[209:51.76]I didn't kill them.
[209:52.90]10 seconds going.
[209:56.19]It's all or nothing time.
[210:03.55]Yeah, I was aiming at you.
[210:05.41]Here comes.
[210:08.68]Oh, I didn't get up there.

[210:12.94]Would you have 44?
[210:13.36]Oh, you're 52.
[210:15.68]I think I hit two arrows.
[210:21.80]was fun this game's fun have you played it before briefly mission begins in 60 seconds I think I'm gonna go who would have thought a simple game like this would have bred the sexiest most attractive streamer on Twitch you're on to this today this is like your thing today I don't know why why is this your thing today it really all just comes back to Team Fortress too
[210:51.26]Why is this your thing today?
[210:56.39]Uh, I'm gonna just be a dickhead this round, so... See if I can make it happen.
[211:06.35]Gonna be a dickhead this round.
[211:07.74]What does that mean?
[211:10.24]Yeah, you two spies think you're so fucking smart.
[211:22.55]I'm going to click their head real gun.
[211:24.87]OK, I really wait.
[211:26.41]The good spies on our team now.
[211:27.84]Oh my God, that's amazing.
[211:28.68]Thank God.
[211:37.44]You better go get him.
[211:41.23]You better really step up this round.
[211:44.63]No excuses, man.
[211:51.85]alright let's go really step up bro what's this you trying to pull on me right now did you hear the rumor by the way that they're adding another class to the game I did not I think that you made it up it's gonna be like a dog
[212:16.43]There's like a dog and there's like a mechanical thing on its back.
[212:18.79]People just running into the train.
[212:22.97]It ate like three people.
[212:24.21]Shit.
[212:31.35]Should've turned around.
[212:32.85]And the train hit people?
[212:34.56]The dog class.
[212:36.56]Yeah.
[212:38.44]What would the dog class' loadout, default loadout be?
[212:44.66]Uh, the woofer.
[212:45.76]Okay.
[212:48.44]Is this like an arcing lightning wand or something?
[212:51.74]What are you talking about?
[212:54.40]What does it do?
[212:57.13]I'd have to go.
[212:57.83]There's a meet the dog that leaked.
[213:07.43]Oh, nice.
[213:08.63]There's too many people on the cart.
[213:11.22]The spy's here somewhere.
[213:16.70]Dude, I fucking popped off a little bit right there.
[213:18.49]It's alright.
[213:26.16]Alright, for those that have no idea, because it is actually probably worth explaining some of these things.
[213:31.81]Explain.
[213:32.79]Explain.
[213:33.75]If I kill somebody with these gloves, I get 100% crits for five seconds.
[213:39.36]I then, because it's not very much time, you can either keep these on, or I like to go to the family business.
[213:44.92]This is a shotgun.
[213:46.10]You get 100% crits on any weapon.
[213:48.36]And this thing has a bunch of clips, and you can pretty much get, I would say, all eight shots out in that five seconds.
[213:57.65]Fat Scout.
[214:05.61]It's pretty fun.
[214:07.15]There's definitely a lot of people that probably don't really know, so... Sincerely speaking, it's probably not a bad idea.
[214:13.27]To teach them.
[214:14.19]Well, because, look, people... You know this as well as I do.
[214:17.78]A lot of people jump into this game, and they get backstabbed, and then they uninstall the game.
[214:22.08]They're just like, what the fuck was that?
[214:23.48]This game's stupid.
[214:25.47]But, like, if you kind of knew, like, kind of what was going on and just, like, why.
[214:31.69]I know what's going on.
[214:32.69]I'm uninstalling afterwards.
[214:34.78]No, you're not.
[214:35.58]Can these hit someone?
[214:41.94]Oh, let's fucking go.
[214:43.08]W. W.
[214:54.60]That guy had a lot of fucking health.
[215:06.23]How many dead skin cells are built up on your mouse buttons?
[215:09.47]I clean my mouse all the time, actually, so not very much.
[215:13.27]I actually clean my mouse.
[215:16.03]I'm gonna check.
[215:17.61]I'm gonna validate.
[215:18.55]Go for it.
[215:24.64]Alright, let me make my dumb build happen.
[215:35.03]Help!
[215:35.53]I'm real.
[215:36.13]Help!
[215:37.85]Help!
[215:44.37]Help!
[215:48.38]How did that not hit?
[215:53.15]That shot him right in the chest.
[215:54.29]It didn't even do any damage.
[215:59.08]Despite their losing a lot.
[216:13.26]Are you real?
[216:24.81]The whole frontier payload feels like a spy all the time when you're on it.
[216:30.53]It's so big.
[216:31.61]I heard a clunky.
[216:32.51]I heard a... You gotta dodge in real life.
[216:48.40]That guy just blew up into the wall.
[216:49.82]What?
[216:50.82]That's weird.
[216:54.76]Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.
[217:05.53]Doctor!
[217:13.53]That was a big crit.
[217:15.25]Hit everybody.
[217:16.21]Alright, I'm going for the actual heavy now.
[217:31.94]Have you opened any cases or crates or anything?
[217:35.02]Oh, I told you I did.
[217:37.60]How many?
[217:37.98]35.
[217:40.77]Whoa.
[217:41.73]Okay.
[217:42.07]That was more than I thought.
[217:49.67]I did not know these windows were here.
[217:51.17]Okay.
[217:58.33]I'm going to try the Liberty Launcher.
[217:59.77]You say this is like the best weapon, right?
[218:01.95]Yeah.
[218:03.45]Like pound for pound.
[218:04.29]This is the like, wow.
[218:09.51]Yeah.
[218:09.77]I don't think anything in the game compares to it.
[218:11.96]Okay.
[218:13.80]I'll try.
[218:25.83]I think I jumped into that.
[218:37.39]I like the sound it makes.
[218:42.26]We're getting this.
[218:46.12]Get out of the way!
[218:53.09]Who's opening the door?
[219:00.15]Where's the sentry up?
[219:03.87]Sentry's almost gone.
[219:09.37]Oh, there's a second one.
[219:10.13]Shit, didn't know it was over there.
[219:14.65]I got it.
[219:15.03]This person's name is... Ow.
[219:20.69]Balls.
[219:27.32]Let's go fast.
[219:34.08]Oh, this is the door you were talking about.
[219:39.63]astrology yeah do you believe in astrology um they mean like stuff like orion's belt like that there's stars in the sky and that like the universe is real and it's just like the universe is expanding and all that oh my goodness I lost him I had to pay attention to it I'm sorry I had crits
[220:09.58]Is this a sentry over there?
[220:10.54]Okay.
[220:13.30]Astronomy or astrology?
[220:15.56]Astrology.
[220:20.00]You're talking about like, uh, like, uh, Virgo and... Yeah, like the Milky Way.
[220:27.98]Um... All of that.
[220:34.49]Um...
[220:37.63]I mean, I know we have like stars and planets and people gave them certain names and certain.
[220:45.97]Like attributes, I don't know.
[220:48.59]Do you think they gave them bad names?
[220:52.13]What do you mean bad names?
[220:54.47]I don't think they're bad.
[220:55.29]OK, yeah, wait, I think you're so you believe in astrology.
[221:01.27]I think are you mixing up two things?
[221:05.11]I'm not.
[221:09.20]Astrology is Zodiac.
[221:10.40]Astronomy is stars and shit.
[221:12.58]Zodiac's the killer.
[221:24.15]Liberty Launcher!
[221:26.75]How's it serving you?
[221:28.72]I think it's fine.
[221:30.98]I mean, I can't tell anything bad about it.
[221:40.24]Oh my goodness.
[221:48.23]I didn't kill anybody.
[221:58.27]Why did I do 100 damage to that guy?
[222:05.50]The Liberty Launcher sucks.
[222:09.11]Oh, are you trying to get me to use like a weapon that's bad or something?
[222:11.29]I don't think it's bad.
[222:17.63]What's wrong with it?
[222:21.11]Nothing.
[222:22.72]You trust me or you're just a random guy in chat?
[222:25.52]I mean, it's like 20,000 random people.
[222:35.48]Where did that even where did he even shoot that from?
[222:47.61]I'm going to start to like, I'm going to start to walk forward and then walk backwards and then walk forward again.
[222:55.56]What astrology sign are you?
[222:57.72]Ergo.
[223:02.85]They're pretty compatible with Leos.
[223:05.37]Is that you?
[223:06.33]Is that what this is?
[223:07.67]Is that where this is going?
[223:09.45]Oh, alright.
[223:11.07]We should look at that.
[223:12.11]Okay.
[223:14.17]Alright.
[223:20.20]I'm going to get you.
[223:24.16]Are you a healer?
[223:24.82]I'm a sniper.

[224:12.21]Don't worry.
[224:12.81]Don't worry, dude.

[224:43.79]Dude, I didn't hit the wall with the rocket.
[224:45.43]You got a bunch of fucking gunk on your screen, okay?
[224:48.79]Clean your screen.
[224:51.97]Clean your screen.
[225:00.14]What the fuck?
[225:06.00]No!
[225:08.18]I gotta walk away.
[225:09.18]We've missed a few too many.
[225:11.95]Walk away time.
[225:13.66]Alright, can you do your best TF2 theme song?
[225:18.97]That's all I got.
[225:45.31]Get in, get in, get in, get in.
[225:46.39]This is time, time, time.
[225:51.85]I'm coming.
[225:53.47]I'm coming.
[225:55.46]I am with you.
[226:02.74]Yes, I am here.
[226:11.43]I just got 60 points in like five minutes.
[226:15.27]That's cool.
[226:33.01]Oh, damn it.
[226:38.39]Can we get this?
[226:39.92]Hey, I moved it pretty far.
[226:46.53]Yeah, I got a couple points too.
[226:53.97]Help me!
[226:54.89]Help me!
[226:56.81]Help me!
[226:57.39]Fuck!
[227:04.10]That medic just looked up directly into the sun.
[227:07.80]What even happened?
[227:13.41]He grabbed his eyes.
[227:14.43]He was like, my eyes.
[227:16.13]You have to focus, Karma.
[227:18.77]You have to focus.
[227:24.94]How do you expect to raise a family if you don't focus?
[227:27.88]Is this what we're doing?
[227:30.04]Is this what we're doing?
[227:51.04]I have a power!
[227:51.94]I have a magic power!
[227:52.92]Oh my god.
[227:53.62]Put auto reload on?
[228:02.57]I hate it.
[228:06.47]It actually distracts me.
[228:13.90]I hate when it's just constantly moving.
[228:28.39]I am focused.
[228:32.84]Are we in there all?
[228:34.02]Frank!
[228:34.74]We're in!
[228:37.12]Just somebody touch it.
[228:37.68]There's like nobody there.
[228:43.55]Where's my team?
[228:45.49]Why is that cart not moving?
[228:49.21]Victory.
[228:50.33]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[228:53.14]Me!
[229:02.04]We gotta leave the server.
[229:03.24]Okay.
[229:05.02]That was a good one.
[229:05.54]That was intense.
[229:07.88]That map?
[229:09.90]That map?
[229:11.98]That made me feel something for once.
[229:14.59]That was fun.
[229:16.75]My blood was pumping.
[229:19.27]My lungs were breathing air.
[229:20.61]Am I being too loud today?
[229:22.33]I feel like I'm yelling a lot.
[229:25.59]I'm yelling over the gameplay.
[229:28.27]I think you're good.
[229:33.10]That was good.
[229:36.78]Alright.
[229:36.98]What about the engineer wrenches?
[229:39.12]Would they change at all?
[229:40.52]Probably.
[229:42.78]Oh, boy.
[229:43.36]He doesn't know.
[229:44.32]He doesn't know, dude.
[229:47.74]I don't think so.
[229:49.66]Wasn't the Jag always, like, best in slot almost always?
[229:55.82]That repair rate is pretty bad.
[229:56.68]Yeah, pretty much.
[229:59.11]Repair rate's pretty bad, though.
[230:05.01]The Eureka Effect will teleport to the exit now of the teleporter.
[230:10.06]That's pretty cool.
[230:16.04]Everything's like subtly changed where it kind of feels like it's the same thing and you just don't remember what the right thing actually was.
[230:22.98]Yeah, that's true.
[230:23.89]Let me use the Sandman.
[230:31.18]Sandman is cool because you go like this.
[230:33.46]No.
[230:34.12]Sandman is do not equip the Sandman.
[230:36.32]What?
[230:36.52]What do you mean?
[230:37.56]It does not stun anymore.
[230:38.70]It slows and it reduces your health by like 15.
[230:41.05]Whoa.
[230:42.11]That is not even close anymore.
[230:44.01]You're right.
[230:46.81]Whoa, that's different.
[230:48.25]What map is this?
[230:49.93]I remember it from ancient times, but I haven't played on it yet.
[231:01.21]Okay, we gotta leave.
[231:02.15]It's over.
[231:02.59]Oh, shit.
[231:03.19]Okay.
[231:03.69]I'm going to try Dead Ringer.
[231:06.99]I'm going to try it.
[231:08.91]Oh, what?
[231:10.70]We lost him.
[231:11.58]Kind of forget everything, but it's alright.
[231:18.32]The big earner.
[231:19.96]What is there to know?
[231:23.36]Don't even go for a backstab.
[231:24.54]Just use your revolver and then your no die button.
[231:30.20]He's doing Dead Ringer kunai cringe.
[231:32.52]No, I'm not.
[231:33.42]I'm looking.
[231:37.10]That's kind of cool.
[231:47.77]Oh, I love this thing.
[231:50.55]The, uh, the latarenga.
[232:01.14]Cloak duration, that's huge.
[232:05.61]There was a new sapper too, wasn't there?
[232:09.73]Rewinds, um, centuries, right?
[232:19.10]The red tape, I think that was in a long time ago though.
[232:24.48]Now this is what I'm talking about.
[232:26.96]I actually feel like I'm, it's like 2014 right now.
[232:28.86]Like 2015. 2015.
[232:34.87]This is exactly what I was looking for.
[232:36.19]Looking for some Thunder Boys?
[232:41.89]Are you using the Liberty Launcher?
[232:44.35]You gotta use the Liberty Launcher.
[232:45.33]Oh wait, no, you're doing your spy thing.
[232:50.64]Oh!
[232:50.82]He doesn't know I'm talking to him.
[232:57.58]This is important.
[232:58.34]I can't play this character unless I put this on.
[233:02.80]right because then it's like people will be like oh that guy probably doesn't know what he's doing I can't have two there's two sentries on the skybox can you go sap those um maybe huh huh
[233:30.40]He's not even moving.
[233:31.91]He's no fear.
[233:33.25]Fuck!
[233:34.67]Shit, I don't... It's been... I don't even know, man.
[233:37.37]It's been?
[233:37.69]You're really gonna do an it's been right now?
[233:40.91]It's... It's been... One week since you looked at me.
[233:47.78]Talked your head to the side and said I'm angry.
[233:50.22]Two days since you laughed at me.
[234:03.82]How did you know?
[234:04.50]Apparently the pain train, I still haven't looked at it.
[234:13.51]You are actually a Gibbous spy.
[234:15.95]Yeah.
[234:18.43]I clicked.
[234:20.65]Yes.
[234:22.13]I gotta remember the fucking buttons.
[234:23.93]I don't think you understand.
[234:29.47]I keep fucking walking out of spawn and I'm dead in one fucking second.
[234:34.83]What?
[234:34.99]Did it crash?
[234:35.73]What was that sound?
[234:42.56]Don't kill me.
[234:48.18]I don't even know how the map connects anymore.
[234:52.74]I'm playing the map knowledge class without remembering anything.
[234:59.34]I got it right here.
[235:07.64]I got a sapper on it.
[235:24.23]Yeah, Spy is not the class to play.
[235:27.40]How did he get the sentry up there?
[235:28.46]What was that?
[235:28.80]Do you see that?
[235:31.68]I think he got a Wrangler jump.
[235:32.82]What the hell was that?
[235:41.75]You got to try your hardest right now, Jerma.
[235:43.33]I need you.
[235:44.15]The enemy team is not a balanced game.
[235:47.53]The enemy team is strong.
[235:48.83]Okay, okay, okay.
[235:50.35]I need you to play your best class.
[235:53.56]Um...
[235:55.92]okay I need you confidently to walk out the spawn door and show me what you're made of okay are you building real sentries no mini century that is the real century alright
[236:26.22]Mission begins in 30 seconds.
[236:30.34]I wish there was a button I could press that would make lawnmower sound effects.
[236:35.14]I got that.
[236:37.06]Can you play them?
[236:38.12]Just play lawnmower sound effects over your mic right now if you can.
[236:41.81]Okay.
[236:48.51]Oh, he's sunny?
[236:49.07]That's the closest I got.
[237:05.22]what they're teleporting enemy team's cheating cheating every team's cheating but they're not actually they're not it's just lagging really bad enemy team has ubered which is also cheating you ever seen an honest man who was invulnerable okay it's slice and dice time
[237:37.73]Did I get a sentry?
[237:43.39]Okay.
[237:43.61]Widowmaker.
[237:44.11]Yeah, this is the one where you do damage, you get ammo back, right?
[237:47.51]This thing's pretty cool, isn't it?
[237:48.33]Man, that sure is a pyro.
[237:56.86]That's a lot of pyros.
[237:58.98]Bro, kill someone.
[238:00.86]We can't walk out our front door.
[238:02.24]I'm an engineer.
[238:03.00]Okay.
[238:18.52]He's running.
[238:18.80]He's running.
[238:19.12]I have no ammo.
[238:22.79]Oh, that's right.
[238:24.37]You have to.
[238:24.87]Okay.
[238:25.13]I forget how this thing worked.
[238:27.79]It shoots metal, doesn't it?
[238:29.19]Not ammo.
[238:32.63]Yes.
[238:32.93]Okay.
[238:33.15]Alright.
[238:39.51]Now I can contribute.
[238:40.45]Now I can help.
[238:47.08]I can't hit that demo.
[238:50.61]Bro, you made a tutorial on this.
[238:54.04]12 years ago.
[238:54.66]I don't know what's changed.
[238:58.42]I don't know where the spots are anymore.
[238:59.80]I don't know what the fuck's going on.
[239:03.25]You might as well say my smite gameplay fucking tutorials are relevant too.
[239:09.62]When are you going to return to smite?
[239:12.98]Alright, I'm concerned because there's spy everywhere.
[239:16.32]Yeah, there's spy everywhere.
[239:19.17]Alright, I'm going to hopefully.
[239:31.83]Watch your tutorial.
[239:34.60]You should.
[239:42.12]I have a dispenser down there.
[239:48.09]I'm having a hard time getting the angle.
[239:53.05]I'm being denied the angle.
[239:57.75]And everyone I see is so incredibly laggy.
[240:04.32]Laggy?
[240:06.78]Yeah, everyone I go to snipe at is teleporting.
[240:10.80]Shit, he got it.
[240:13.94]OK, teleporter going up in.
[240:16.18]I don't know this room here.
[240:27.21]Get out of here.
[240:31.55]You still alive?
[240:33.07]Yep, nope.
[240:39.54]Are you friendly?
[240:40.30]Okay, no, this guy's friendly.
[240:41.60]He can live for another five seconds.
[240:44.12]Somebody go through the teleporter, please, and telefrag him.
[240:45.88]That'd be so funny.
[240:51.37]Uh, I need to, like, build this... Don't do that.
[240:53.99]Oh.
[240:55.15]You're gonna get... He's gonna get telefragged, I was gonna say.
[240:57.71]You know what?
[241:01.49]That's how it goes.
[241:09.48]I think we're about to win.
[241:11.02]We kind of are, aren't we?
[241:14.16]Yeah, we were the mega loser team, so something changed.
[241:19.54]I don't know.
[241:22.03]It's doing good.
[241:25.33]Jeez, okay.
[241:32.35]Well.
[241:37.25]Take it.
[241:38.97]You didn't do anything?
[241:39.71]I teleported two people.
[241:41.20]One person I teleported went on to kill eight people in a row.
[241:45.60]If he was not up there, if he was not at the front lines, in that 10 to 20 seconds, they could have turned it around.
[241:58.57]I don't think you guys understand how important engineers really are on Team Fortress.
[242:07.71]What are these clown pants?
[242:08.65]I love these.
[242:11.81]What is that?
[242:13.65]Wait, you have one of the... Did you see the tank?
[242:21.07]Somebody was in a tank.
[242:22.31]The soldier was in a tank, like a real one.
[242:25.01]Yeah.
[242:29.74]I feel like we're playing the mobile game version of Team Fortress right now.
[242:35.37]not just playing Team Fortress right now no I mean like we all have vehicles and it's like a go-kart game that's just you it was a few of us what is the uh isn't that's another shotgun too right oh I'm gonna go boost bonk ram ompson
[243:05.41]I gotta look at all these things before even committing to anything.
[243:17.32]Jesus.
[243:17.70]Is this heavy wearing shorts?
[243:36.45]Ooh, Spongebob.
[243:43.16]I'm so slow.
[243:44.78]Holy shoot.
[243:46.62]We're on it.
[243:47.10]Whoa, what?
[243:49.16]Whoa, what?
[244:19.97]Hello?
[244:32.97]Do you like or dislike being tickled?
[244:36.89]Depends.
[244:38.75]On who's doing it?
[244:40.13]I don't know.
[244:42.25]What do you mean you don't know?
[244:42.99]It was your answer.
[244:46.25]Why are you even asking these questions?
[244:51.29]You've asked me like just as weird questions.
[244:56.73]I am cracking out right now.
[245:13.90]Somebody just said, bro, dude, he wants you.
[245:21.02]You... You... Fuck.
[245:24.18]I want you to answer the question.
[245:26.22]Some people like being tickled.
[245:27.78]Some people don't.
[245:28.78]It's like a very... Don't you think it's weird that humans can be tickled?
[245:33.10]Isn't that just fucking bizarre?
[245:34.70]You know you can't do it to yourself?
[245:38.10]Now I do.
[245:38.80]Yeah, you're right.
[245:40.56]Yeah.
[245:40.90]Isn't the whole thing weird?
[245:42.00]So do you like it or not like it?
[245:43.68]The whole, yeah, no, I don't, the whole thing is weird.
[245:45.48]Okay, but you're being very evasive.
[245:52.42]I want you, uh, tickle yourself right now.
[245:54.64]See?
[245:56.06]Doesn't do anything.
[245:56.52]Just feels like, eh, it's like hurts.
[245:59.44]It hurts.
[246:00.12]What do you mean it hurts?
[246:03.36]It like hurts.
[246:04.66]I'm like, it's like, ow, that like, it's like painful.
[246:07.19]It hurts me.
[246:14.97]If I can't ask stupid questions, you can't have stupid answers.
[246:18.98]Isn't that the point?
[246:21.68]I want real answers.
[246:24.34]I thought the point of asking stupid questions was to get stupid answers.
[246:29.22]No, I want to know your truth.
[246:33.56]What about you?
[246:37.19]I hate it.
[246:37.55]I don't like it.
[246:38.05]I'm on team.
[246:38.73]I don't like being tickled.
[246:40.94]I don't understand why you would like being tickled.
[246:43.52]Like, I was kind of hoping that you would be like a tickle me guy.
[246:46.39]No, I mean... What happened to me?
[246:53.03]What happened to me?
[246:55.63]I'm playing pretty well.
[246:56.49]Is this server just that weird?
[247:04.16]With the teleporter?
[247:05.24]Somebody said, what constitutes a correct answer?
[247:09.20]Yeah, like, I don't know what he's looking for.
[247:10.96]Well, you said... The answer was... The question was, do you like being tickled?
[247:16.00]And your answer was, if you tickle yourself, it hurts.
[247:18.48]No, okay, listen.
[247:19.27]There's a spy at spawn, by the way.
[247:22.17]Okay, if you're, you know, hanging out, and your girlfriend's like, oh, okay, we're, like, cuddling, and like, oh, that tickled, right?
[247:29.31]Like, that's fine.
[247:29.89]No, it's not.
[247:31.97]Why not?
[247:35.08]That'd make me mad.
[247:36.18]That would piss you off.
[247:37.88]Yeah.
[247:40.48]You better not tickle me when I come see you.
[247:56.69]God damn it!
[247:57.69]This fucking... Okay, I'm... He blew himself up.
[248:03.43]I'm actually okay with that because that was a Gibbous Spy.
[248:07.09]Right on.
[248:08.47]I'm glad you got that kill.
[248:12.90]I have a weird tickle spot.
[248:17.86]That's why I hate it.
[248:19.52]Okay.
[248:22.36]Someone touches my side, I spasm and freak out.
[248:24.63]It's not a tickle.
[248:25.55]It's like a... I don't know.
[248:29.11]It's beyond tickle.
[248:33.51]And Ashley says, yeah, I know where it is, smile.
[248:38.17]She does.
[248:39.05]My mom was also acutely aware of where it was.
[248:42.50]and she would torment me because like it's not like oh tickles it it's like if you just put a finger there I like I just freak out it really feels like my in my internal organs do like a 180 like it they all shift it is it's weird somebody in all caps just said can we change the subject
[249:05.91]what do you mean every person in your chat in the world has been tickled why can't we talk about it we are extensively by the way is that a problem no I'm just laughing because somebody said it in all caps okay change the subject what do you got
[249:28.06]That was way longer than a minute.
[249:29.74]That was at least five minutes.
[249:30.90]How big do you want to pepperonis?
[249:59.05]Oh, you just tickled me.
[250:00.19]What the fuck?
[250:03.20]Big pepperonis kind of creep me out.
[250:06.19]Actually true.
[250:06.73]I agree with you on that one.
[250:14.75]And I had there's a there's a middle ground because I also had small pepperonis.
[250:18.47]Yeah.
[250:18.71]And they cook and they like curl up into like moon craters and they just house every ounce of grease from the pizza cooking.
[250:26.63]And it's just if you if I eat like one or two of them, I start feeling like I'm going to die.
[250:33.70]Yeah, too many pepperonis is.
[250:36.06]Yeah, I agree.
[250:36.80]Especially large pepperonis.
[250:39.00]No, I like the really small ones because they fit on pizza really well.
[250:44.41]I don't like when the entire pizza looks like Khaled.
[250:48.85]No.
[250:51.99]I like when pepperonis, they're small and you get at least a few in like every other bite.
[250:57.62]But no, no, don't don't turn that shit into Khaled.
[251:00.14]No, thank you.
[251:02.70]Are you a fan of any type of pizza that does not use like a mozzarella, not like tomato sauce?
[251:10.92]Yeah, like a white pizza.
[251:12.79]yeah it can be good yeah what's your ultimate alternative pizza um oh this hold on this guy's friendly uh I don't think there's very many other than that what's another like alternative pizza that like a not mozzarella not traditional hold on I gotta think about this just just not like tomato sauce oh yeah barbecue chicken's pretty good
[251:40.16]I used to have one.
[251:40.90]I can't remember what it was, and I'm really sad.
[251:42.60]Buffalo chicken?
[251:43.36]You were going to say it randomly, and then I would just know that that's what I like.
[251:47.64]Does buffalo chicken have red sauce on it?
[251:51.44]I think sometimes it depends on where you get it.
[251:55.50]I mean, the color isn't a relevant component.
[252:00.68]Oh, I went flying.
[252:01.62]I think it was like a garlic paste.
[252:05.84]I don't know.
[252:09.01]Yeah, buffalo chicken pizza is great.
[252:10.23]Depending on where you get it.
[252:12.69]Ster looks cute.
[252:13.43]You should compliment him.
[252:14.21]Ster, apparently you look cute right now.
[252:16.13]Is that true?
[252:21.62]I don't... I don't like the term cute for me.
[252:24.24]You know what I mean?
[252:25.94]Yeah.
[252:29.41]I feel you.
[252:30.51]I like things... Like if you call me big and chunky...
[252:37.02]And gigantic and huge.
[252:40.65]That's way better.
[252:45.59]I'm not vascular.
[252:46.23]That's better?
[252:46.91]Yeah.
[252:49.86]You want to be called big and chunky and huge?
[252:53.93]Yes!
[252:56.00]Oh I mean- I get for like working out maybe I get it?
[252:57.00]No no no no no not even like working out - here's the thing because if you're like: Oh! You're so cute!
[253:04.00]I feel like it's kind of disingenuous and it kind of just glosses over the reality, so I'd rather someone acknowledge the reality of like you're kind of fucking- you're chunky man.
[253:11.00]And like that's- that's really me and I- I like me. Like, I don't care. I'm a little... you know.
[253:16.00]But it's like you're acknowledging that about me and I'm like yep it's real. It feels real.
[253:27.03]You ever just hang out in the pool with your bros and measure your thighs?
[253:30.05]I did recently.
[253:33.59]What the fuck are you talking about?
[253:34.97]I got really big thighs.
[253:38.21]You... You mean take out a tape measurer?
[253:41.29]And... No, we had a third party.
[253:43.67]What are you talking about today?
[253:48.85]You measured your thighs?
[253:51.66]Like how big they are?
[253:52.72]Well, no, I had someone feel my thighs and someone feel Thorfor's thighs and compare it.
[253:58.35]What is going on right now?
[254:12.12]Do you want to change the subject again?
[254:14.30]Is everything that I'm interested in just like not okay?
[254:17.95]No, it's fucking funny.
[254:20.01]Hey, bro.
[254:20.93]The new Armored Core is coming out.
[254:22.19]That seems cool.
[254:24.45]I didn't tell you to stop.
[254:25.83]Get away from me.
[254:35.68]Let him cook.
[254:36.20]Yeah.
[254:37.38]My chat says, in the text to speech, I'm looking like an entire jar of Jif's extra chunky peanut butter today.
[254:43.70]And I loved it.
[254:45.06]Unironically, absolutely just lit my day up.
[254:48.23]Someone said, Jerma is hyper-focused, so Ster has free reign right now.
[254:57.97]I can do anything I want.
[255:02.27]I mean, I'm doing alright.
[255:05.77]I'm just having fun.
[255:06.85]It's fun to run around and spray people with the fire flamethrower.
[255:25.61]I cannot let you get away with that.
[255:28.11]Oh, he has a healer now.
[255:37.69]You should put Pyrovision on.
[255:38.83]I don't know.
[255:40.17]You should.
[255:40.67]I feel like Pyrovision's the original developer intended route.
[255:53.54]What is your favorite movie of all time?
[255:57.82]It's hard to pick one, you know?
[255:59.18]Everyone's always concerned about favorites.
[256:03.66]True.
[256:04.04]But like...
[256:06.07]don't they all have like their own purpose and their own little spot in your heart yeah your own little baby boo-boos like I want to watch this one when blah or I'd like this one for me yeah that's fair get out of here that I have like the shortest memory possible for it and I forget movies that I like every time I'm I'm asked that question or like there's all the time where a movie will come up and I'm like oh yeah I do love that movie a lot
[256:34.71]can't remember it or like if I'm just on the spot I think a lot of movies have come out so it's really easy to kind of forget some of them even if you really like them yeah how spoiled this I've had this thought many times how spoiled are we when we're all like oh I'm so sad and I'm so bored
[256:56.71]And like, I can't even remember all of the great media that I love in a single moment.
[257:02.60]I can't even sit here and be like, what movie do I like?
[257:05.44]I don't fucking... God, it's too hard to tell you all of the things that are awesome.
[257:10.76]How many games are on Steam?
[257:14.99]I looked this up like very recently.
[257:17.63]What is it?
[257:17.97]It's like 10,000-ish.
[257:21.81]10,500.
[257:21.89]So you would have to play... But that might be outdated from like a few years ago.
[257:28.38]You would have to play like 30 games a day until you were dead.
[257:32.92]If you couldn't play them all.
[257:37.30]Why do you want me to die?
[257:38.10]I'm just saying.
[257:50.13]There's 50k now.
[257:50.75]Yeah, I think the number I saw was like 2018 or something.
[257:53.33]Over 700,000 games.
[257:58.17]I like bad movies that chat will disagree with me on, like Mother.
[258:00.95]I think Mother was an awesome movie.
[258:04.18]Mother?
[258:05.26]Mother.
[258:07.08]I never saw it.
[258:08.32]I would rewatch Mother with you.
[258:09.86]I love that movie.
[258:12.24]Alright, let's go.
[258:13.84]Movie night, let's do it.
[258:15.18]And if anyone who knows the movie, the guy bouncing on the kitchen counter, and she's like, get off, come on, get off the counter.
[258:22.17]Dude, that's like YouTube comments to me at that point in my life.
[258:28.34]I was like, this guy's a YouTube commenter.
[258:31.92]Um, Birdman.
[258:33.90]You seen Birdman?
[258:35.06]I have.
[258:35.40]Yeah, it's great.
[258:36.58]Great movie.
[258:38.92]Come on.
[258:39.76]We can do it again.
[258:40.70]We can do another fucking movie.
[258:43.10]Four more movies in a row.
[258:45.76]Fuck all these idiots.
[258:47.55]All these morons don't know what we're really capable of doing.
[258:51.13]The movie's about me.
[258:58.65]I am Birdman.
[259:00.05]You are Birdman.
[259:02.40]I don't like the ending.
[259:05.34]I headcanon a different ending.
[259:06.74]And they did rewrite the ending.
[259:09.30]We're leaving, right?
[259:11.30]We're leaving, yeah.
[259:14.72]I just think Birdman is one of those movies that
[259:19.40]the style of trying to shoot something pretending that it's all essentially happening in a row even if it's not happening it still takes a lot to get that to happen and make any sense it's like a great piece of uh of cinema it's very good yep it's it is like what I would describe for like a true movie like this is a real movie this is a piece of cinema
[259:57.11]Hidden cuts.
[259:59.39]Yeah, that's fine, though.
[260:02.55]There are at least a few times where Michael Keaton's walking around going from space to space without a cut.
[260:08.40]That even... Let me tell you something.
[260:10.22]Coming from the YouTube world, where you have to go like this, you know what I mean?
[260:15.30]Think about, like, all the YouTube videos you've ever seen.
[260:17.36]And, like, I've done this.
[260:18.08]I do this all the time.
[260:19.46]This shit, where it's like, Hey, everybody, welcome to...
[260:24.43]Yeah, we're back.
[260:25.69]Here's another cut.
[260:27.01]Oh, and I fucked that up.
[260:28.09]Do it again.
[260:30.25]So, at the end of the day, the most important thing is to make sure that as we go forward, as a species, we should always drink water.
[260:42.50]It's hard to actually go in a row.
[260:44.60]I missed the first half, and we should drink water is where I picked up.
[260:48.29]As a species, yes, we should always drink water.
[260:50.07]I agree.
[260:50.57]Yes.
[260:51.96]But my point is that the YouTuber shit where we cut every 5 to 12 seconds because we don't remember what we were going to say.
[261:02.55]What's wrong with that?
[261:04.48]It's I'm just saying it's hard.
[261:05.52]It's hard to go right in a row.
[261:06.50]You know who does this really well?
[261:08.08]You know, let me tell you something.
[261:09.54]Me?
[261:10.04]No.
[261:11.19]Oh, damn.
[261:12.81]Well, you know, actually, I think you're pretty good at this, too.
[261:15.53]But you know who's really, really good at this?
[261:17.85]You?
[261:18.55]One take is so fucking good at this.
[261:21.10]And I don't even know how the fuck he does it is Ludwig.
[261:24.30]Ludwig will do like a 20 minute video where he does not miss a single beat.
[261:32.21]Not a single beat.
[261:33.37]And it's all one take.
[261:34.59]I don't even know how he does it.
[261:35.95]It's actually a talent.
[261:36.79]It truly is.
[261:39.51]And it's not like he's stopping.
[261:41.56]He is full on explaining something, talking, addressing the camera.
[261:46.30]It's fucking crazy what he does.
[261:47.94]He can do it in one take.
[261:49.58]I don't like Ludwig.
[261:50.68]You guys should meet.
[261:51.76]You probably like him.
[261:54.25]Versus Saxon Hail?
[261:55.23]Yes, no.
[261:56.25]Yeah, why not?
[261:56.71]Let's try it.
[262:01.61]Well, I think we have to wait for this round to end.
[262:04.11]I will try to do that and I'll get like 30 seconds in and be like, fuck me and have to start the whole thing over again.
[262:14.11]I'll... If I do it, I feel like the video would be better if I didn't do it.
[262:22.90]yeah but you do it anyways you start over anyways there's been a couple times where I like start over multiple times and then I feel like I get one take because I've just said it like eight times in a row yeah but even then I still think it would just like why not cut why not cut like the second or two of dead space net like you know and also too if you go through one thing in one take
[262:48.25]There's a huge possibility that you, somewhere in that, like, five straight minutes, you said something that wasn't correct.
[262:56.32]And it's like, god damn it.
[262:58.32]You left?
[262:58.60]Yeah.
[262:59.62]Okay.
[263:02.83]I realized I didn't want to play Saxon Hill.
[263:04.81]I love how that was your idea, and you're like, nah, never mind.
[263:08.65]Well, it put us in there, and then, you know... But, like, getting something wrong in the middle of a commentary like that, or talking like that,
[263:19.30]Then you watch it back and you're like, wow, I did a pretty good job.
[263:22.04]Oh, the thing I said at two minutes is completely fucking wrong.
[263:26.06]Now what?
[263:26.92]Do you just take a little cut and put it in there and leave the rest?
[263:30.48]Or is that weird?
[263:33.36]I mean, I haven't seen his videos.
[263:35.20]Is he full on camera 100% of the video?
[263:38.64]Yeah, so he'll do like mobile mails.
[263:42.44]Does something go over him where he can do like a fake cut?
[263:46.85]No, I don't think so.
[263:48.01]I think he just does it.
[263:48.97]He just goes for it.
[263:50.19]Man.
[263:52.15]What a legend.
[263:55.31]Stop trying to make your boss sound good.
[263:58.01]Dude, he already wants a raise.
[264:01.15]He is good.
[264:01.84]What do you want me to pretend he's not?
[264:03.54]That's weird.
[264:04.06]That's weirder.
[264:08.62]That's weirder for me to pretend that he's not.
[264:20.74]I mean he I I would say I think he is the most attractive YouTuber oh god here we go again you cute us right yeah we're cute alright good uh did you did you have a favorite movie you want to toss your hat in gremlins 2 gremlins 2.
[264:49.39]I'm about, I'm hovering over the leave game.
[264:50.93]I just, I, I'm threatening to leave the game.
[264:55.87]Explain why you just left.
[264:59.89]I'll click it.
[265:01.49]Um, it's a mixture of like shocking.
[265:08.06]Wow.
[265:08.44]Gremlins 2 is his favorite movie, but then also like, it's funny cause it fits.
[265:15.86]Yeah.
[265:18.17]I feel like if you had the opportunity to have a pet Mugwai, you would gremlinify it because you think the gremlins are cuter.
[265:31.74]He gets it.
[265:37.09]If you think that the gremlins are cute, is that appropriate?
[265:43.99]I just think, okay, the Gremlins, to me, are Looney Tunes characters.
[265:48.35]They go from being these, like, cute little, oh, it's such a cute little, like, kitten, it's a cute little puppy, to turning into a Looney Tunes Daffy Duck character.
[265:59.13]I mean, I like the Looney Tunes Daffy Duck character more than the, like, cute one.
[266:04.97]I find that to be more interesting to me.
[266:09.57]Exactly.
[266:11.17]full circle that's why I don't want to be called cute and I'd rather be called a full tub of jif extra chunky peanut butter I feel it uh I'm gonna do you want to be the cute gremlin or you want to be the cool gremlin I want to be the gremlin that talks because that's the best one the one that sings New York New York I disagree completely
[266:40.86]Oh, you would be the vegetable one, wouldn't you?
[266:43.96]I don't like it when there's a show where one Pokémon Meowth and the whole world learns how to talk.
[266:50.11]No, but it's not that way.
[266:51.59]Have you seen Gremlins 2?
[266:54.92]Probably like 30 years ago before I was born.
[266:58.52]Okay.
[266:59.78]He didn't learn how to talk.
[267:01.80]He drank a fucking potion in a weird lab that grew his brain.
[267:08.35]He didn't learn how to talk.
[267:09.49]He drank a potion that made him smarter.
[267:15.35]And there was only one potion to drink.
[267:19.56]Of course there was only one potion to drink.
[267:23.16]Oh my goodness, that's a lot of people.
[267:24.90]Yes, it is.
[267:29.48]Oh, he went rage heavy.
[267:34.29]Oh, what the fuck?
[267:35.83]That just like hurt.
[267:40.97]Dude, you need to get that potion.
[267:45.72]I think I'm, I think I'm just fine.
[268:01.45]I need health.
[268:03.33]I'm abandoning the point.
[268:04.11]They're winning right now.
[268:05.01]They can cap the last point like this is steel and they're just straight doing it and no one is.
[268:10.19]They just capped it.
[268:11.69]This is going to be awkward.
[268:12.75]This is awkward.
[268:14.61]Oh shit.
[268:15.03]This is kind of awkward.
[268:15.95]Impossible to win.
[268:17.75]I have never seen it happen.
[268:23.43]Hey, that's a challenge then.
[268:26.98]I thought they just won if they got D. Where are you at?
[268:30.43]I got a crit.
[268:31.61]I'm on the point.
[268:33.15]Oh, hey, Frank.
[268:33.93]Hello.
[268:34.35]Are you ready?
[268:44.38]Ooh, right at the end there.
[268:45.52]Nice.
[268:55.13]Alright, is it time to get out there?
[268:56.59]I... What happened?
[269:00.37]What's going on?
[269:01.21]Why did you just stop talking?
[269:04.70]Because something's broken on my stream and it is doubling text to speeches.
[269:11.78]So I had to go drown myself.
[269:17.06]And they pointed out... The Meowth lore.
[269:24.91]What's the Meowth lore that we... I think Meowth learned to talk so he could impress a girl.
[269:32.69]Really?
[269:33.96]Apparently that's all it takes.
[269:37.16]Alright, we got... We gotta get on a point or something.
[269:46.58]Oh shit, behind us.
[269:47.46]This is bad.
[269:47.92]Two scouts.
[269:48.46]This is bad.
[269:49.54]We're in trouble here.
[269:53.29]Oh, my Lord.
[269:56.01]No, no, no, no.
[269:57.85]I got to abandon you.
[269:58.65]I'm sorry.
[270:00.43]Help me.
[270:00.71]Help me.
[270:00.97]Help me.
[270:01.15]Help me.
[270:01.41]Help, help, help, help, help, help.
[270:04.13]Oh, shit.
[270:04.51]This guy's AFK.
[270:14.61]He's got an awesome outfit, though.
[270:18.70]Oh, the crit's pretty taunt.
[270:19.68]I forgot.
[270:20.00]That's right.
[270:27.77]What was that cute little duck sound?
[270:33.44]Do you still have any unusuals or did you get rid of those over the years?
[270:37.26]I gave them all to tip of the hats for the kids.
[270:42.92]What is considered the the unusual now?
[270:46.40]Like what is like the best one now?
[270:48.80]Any idea?
[270:51.34]No clue.
[270:52.12]I have never had any comprehension of the unusual market after like
[270:57.64]Like ancient times, it was like the green flame.
[271:00.98]And then once they started adding more, I had no idea anymore.
[271:04.41]People are still saying, yeah, burning team captain.
[271:07.91]Oh, okay.
[271:08.43]I guess I still know.
[271:09.79]Damn.
[271:11.55]Really?
[271:11.87]Even after all the updates?
[271:14.67]No new one has come out?
[271:15.51]Maybe because those crates are rarer because they're old?
[271:18.04]That's true.
[271:20.76]It's rare.
[271:21.14]Okay.
[271:24.18]Do you want it right when the door opens or?
[271:27.54]oh we're doing a Frank the fish uh are we hey let's do this let me know okay uh I'll wait for you spawn

[272:29.67]I thought I would get more, but I was nervous.
[272:32.17]There's a lot of pyros.
[272:36.60]I think it was still worth it.
[272:39.64]Yeah, look at the momentum that we're driving for a team right now.
[272:43.48]Oh, he's the real power.
[272:48.43]It's me again.
[272:49.13]Hi, there's a lot of people in this area.
[272:52.53]Buy behind spy behind demo right here.
[272:55.21]There's way too.
[272:55.89]I'm fucking running back spawn dude.
[273:00.05]There's a sentry in the water at our spawn.
[273:05.21]What?
[273:09.59]I got it.
[273:14.33]And yeah, they can't shoot out of the water.
[273:16.64]So they only kill desperate losers like me.
[273:22.70]Oh shit.
[273:23.56]This is bad.
[273:24.28]This is really bad.
[273:24.96]I got stuck in the fucking water.
[273:30.29]help heal me medic help he died help medic medic medic medic medic dude the Liberty Launcher is insane I don't even have to worry about it getting reflected because it won't do any damage so is that is it bad and that's the thing what what do you I feel like you're tearing in two different directions there I
[273:57.50]Believe in it.
[273:58.36]I'm a believer.
[273:59.78]I think it was fine.
[274:00.62]No one else believes in it.
[274:01.92]It does a lot less damage.
[274:03.00]If you hit someone at long range, it scales down to 18 damage.
[274:07.49]Oh, that's why I was doing like 30 damage, right?
[274:09.95]Yes.
[274:11.41]This is scary.
[274:12.03]There's a lot of stickies here.
[274:13.71]Yes, there is.
[274:14.23]I'm not going over there.
[274:15.53]Yeah, let's go on the left side.
[274:16.43]Left side.
[274:16.79]Let's do this left side.
[274:17.75]Let's go left.
[274:24.84]I have one.
[274:27.46]Make sure you got full rockets.
[274:28.80]This is dangerous.
[274:38.18]Oh, Spawn!
[274:41.29]Behind you!
[274:44.31]Look behind you!
[274:46.49]We would have killed everyone.
[274:48.61]I can't, but there's somebody always behind.
[274:51.34]What the heck?
[274:56.39]I'm not playing pyro.
[274:57.63]That's my class.
[275:07.22]What the hell am I doing?
[275:18.80]there was a Demoman in the water why am I getting the receiving end of all this nonsense I changed class by the way yeah you better I'm going I'm going whatever mode I'm going I'm going in
[276:08.43]I don't think it should be this hard to leave spawn.
[276:14.61]Yes!
[276:26.64]Accidental taunt cancel.
[276:27.96]Is that what I did?
[276:32.57]Mouse plus W. Yeah, well, sometimes you have to.
[276:39.67]they're the pyro character someone said flog does not deserve pog flog pog ow oh my oh my oh my flog this is all your fault
[277:09.56]I don't think it is considering I have more points than you.
[277:14.58]Okay.
[277:22.35]Why is my game running at like 30 FPS?
[277:31.19]Why is that?
[277:31.73]That's a good question.
[277:33.08]I don't know.
[277:37.60]I don't think we, it was only me and you that were able to touch the point for like a millisecond.
[277:51.29]64 gigs of Ram.
[277:51.93]Can't handle it.
[277:53.55]Leave.
[277:57.59]So, uh, tell me how, okay, good.
[278:06.71]How late are you going?
[278:09.65]How much Team Fortress is enough for this addict?
[278:14.91]I think like another hour.
[278:17.31]I'm having fun.
[278:20.53]Are you trying to get going?
[278:25.40]I want to be with you.
[278:26.26]Okay, so let's keep playing.
[278:30.78]I want a good engineer round.
[278:32.26]A really good one.

[280:07.66]I like them both.
[280:08.80]I think they're both really good.
[280:10.26]I just like the second one better.
[280:11.84]It's comedy horror.
[280:18.62]Yeah, the second one is like full Looney Tunes though.
[280:23.73]Is Pyroland working here?
[280:27.91]No, but I'll keep the blower on.
[280:30.21]Why not?
[280:35.03]I'm going to play...
[280:37.43]Pirate Spy!
[280:38.25]I don't think I've ever played this map.
[280:45.02]Really?
[280:45.42]This was like every single server when Contract came out.
[280:51.62]Oh, no.
[280:52.20]Yeah.
[280:52.52]Okay.
[280:52.72]I had to see Outsider.
[281:01.78]You know what?
[281:03.12]I'm going to be the Dead Ringer guy.
[281:05.58]When I die,
[281:09.25]I'm just gonna play spy as a scout with a revolver.
[281:14.71]And just be immune to dying.
[281:19.25]Smart.
[281:20.17]What is... Is there somebody in the water?
[281:26.78]So you're gonna... Okay, you're going for it.
[281:30.28]Let's see it.
[281:49.66]wow Dead Ringer wins it did you actually just do that no I just spawned and didn't get to do anything yet there you go oh geez love what does the happy camper on sniper do these days
[282:15.10]Is that the no flinching and you get healed?
[282:19.61]That's the big thing.
[282:20.89]You get healed.
[282:21.85]More health every couple seconds, I think.
[282:24.39]Pretty damn good.
[282:39.35]Shit.
[282:42.29]Adjust your view model so we can see the goddamn game.
[282:44.19]That's because I'm using the rainbow thing.
[282:50.75]I like it big.
[282:52.81]Same.
[282:54.71]Yeah, I like it.
[283:04.46]This game's about to be over in like two seconds.
[283:07.70]Are you all the way back there?
[283:10.28]No, I just feel like we're rolling them.
[283:27.75]I'm just this is just bubbles everywhere.
[283:40.94]Guys running all over the place.
[284:00.48]Are we... ...requeuing or what?
[284:15.16]Ah, yeah, we're leaving.
[284:16.33]Can we do one or two on Bunker Hill?
[284:23.65]No.
[284:24.53]You haven't even done Sablian yet.
[284:26.96]Which one do you like out of all of them?
[284:29.20]Everyone's going to want you to experience Sablian.
[284:32.54]Okay, let's do it.
[284:34.72]It's like the map from the update, and I'm shocked it hasn't.
[284:38.92]I even tried to queue into it exclusively before, and I wasn't doing it.
[284:42.52]I typically always get it.
[284:45.68]Didn't they nerf the Pompson into the ground at one point?
[284:51.30]I guess.
[284:51.64]I don't even remember what that thing does.
[284:58.17]We play different... I'm not an engineer.
[285:02.11]You really don't play it, right?
[285:03.81]I don't play engineer.
[285:04.77]I don't play your spy very much.
[285:08.15]Your medic...
[285:11.76]So this is the one that when you hit somebody with it, the medic will lose up to 10% Medi Gun charge.
[285:24.11]This really doesn't seem that bad.
[285:26.41]I don't remember it having the on-hit victim loses cloak.
[285:30.42]It feels new.
[285:34.08]But again, I would not remember.
[285:39.32]I'll try the short circuit.
[285:41.32]So now it's actually a projectile.
[285:42.70]It's not like electricity that comes out of your hand?
[285:49.38]So alt fire, what does the regular fire do?
[285:51.69]Anything?
[285:56.83]It still is electricity.
[285:57.83]Okay.
[286:02.95]Bro, this is the worst loadout I could possibly have.
[286:14.16]Well, let's try to make it work.
[286:17.26]Why not?
[286:17.98]What's your secondary?
[286:19.78]Pompson, Short Circuit, and the Jag.
[286:25.42]Is that the worst possible engineer loadout?
[286:30.01]I don't know.
[286:30.35]The Jag seems intelligent.
[286:32.73]You want to put on the Eureka Effect.
[286:37.47]I'll put on the Wrangler.
[286:42.05]What is so bad about this?
[286:43.70]Actually, it looks like they buff the Eureka Effect a lot.
[286:47.80]I remember it just being kind of quirky.
[286:50.66]Press your reload key to choose to teleport to spawn or your exit teleporter.
[286:58.15]Minus 50% metal cost when constructing or upgrading.
[287:00.93]Ooh, that's actually kind of good.
[287:02.57]Guys, we can't get a cell bloomin' server.
[287:09.31]They just don't exist.
[287:11.43]I'll try it.
[287:15.30]Don't use the Palmson.
[287:16.18]You'd be better off turning your monitor off and playing the game with your face.
[287:21.61]Wow.
[287:22.33]Why?
[287:22.69]Why?
[287:25.41]They're doubting you.
[287:26.73]They are.
[287:26.95]They don't think you can handle it.
[287:28.07]They are doubting.
[287:28.85]Big time.
[287:29.33]Yeah.
[287:32.57]What did you cue us to?
[287:36.00]I'm trying to get us in Sanobian.
[287:38.58]There we go.
[287:39.02]I'm going to go get like a water after this.
[287:40.62]My voice is like drying up.
[287:42.30]I feel like I'm going to cough dust out in a second.
[287:46.84]So this map is a little bit different.
[287:50.45]This is a little bit of a mixture of Call of Duty's Kill Confirmed with a zoo.
[287:56.57]Okay.
[287:57.81]So what you're going to want to do is you're going to kill enemy players and pick up fish.
[288:02.29]What?
[288:03.74]And then when the seal appears, you want to feed the seal the fish you collect.
[288:09.48]Okay.
[288:09.84]I'm going to play something else.
[288:13.06]You already gave up.
[288:14.87]Just not engineer.
[288:16.01]I don't know what the hell is going on.
[288:19.35]Wow.
[288:23.47]So get kills, pick up seals, pick up fish, feed the fish to the seal.
[288:29.02]Okay.
[288:31.44]And if you are the leader, if you hold the most fish, then you become a dispenser effect for your team and the enemy team can see where you are through all.
[288:45.44]oh at the bottom left it'll if maybe I don't know your hud if you see like a random floating number those are people who have the fish I like that little truck oh our seal is swimming around
[289:10.16]it's everybody's seal everybody needs to feed the seal oh and the seal is an eldritch old god and it favors whichever team feeds it more and then it banishes the other team from this mortal coil which is the only part I've made up but it's the only reason I can come up with why we'd be feeding the seal and fighting over it
[289:49.55]oh no I thought the medic was still there uh I don't get it at all but I I think I after a round or two I'll get it uh yeah it really is just like it's not you'll see because the seal isn't always active
[290:15.07]So like right now he's doing 321 seal feed the seal.
[290:17.97]So that guy is 20.
[290:19.41]OK, I get it.
[290:20.11]Yeah, yep, yep, yep.
[290:21.27]You gotta kill that guy and get that guy's fish.
[290:24.13]Because he's feeding the fish pretty hard right now.
[290:43.46]Oh shit spy.
[290:51.74]We're all the way back to the spawn.
[290:53.94]Kind of.
[290:56.76]Well, you gotta feed this thing.
[290:59.74]Oh, there we go.
[291:00.18]Who's got the most fish?
[291:01.12]Spy as spy.
[291:15.99]I got a banner.
[291:16.49]I got a banner.
[291:19.40]what the fuck dude come on I feel like every time I'm about to do click a good thing I get backstabbed every time maybe you should look behind you I did maybe you should do circles maybe you shouldn't be streaming what the fuck
[291:49.54]Someone shoot him.
[291:50.28]I can't do it.
[291:52.92]That's a fucking spy right there.
[291:54.52]Guarantee it.
[291:55.12]Yeah, he's still alive.
[291:57.32]He's like right here.
[292:05.36]The guy with 11.
[292:06.90]You got to get these 11.
[292:08.84]Oh my God.
[292:10.38]I'm just going to play Pyro.
[292:11.38]Never change ever.
[292:14.49]I feel like I can play the game if I play Pyro.
[292:24.96]Oh, this is cool.
[292:27.42]Okay, we got to feed the seal.
[292:29.16]Seal time.
[292:29.58]He comes out of the van.
[292:40.23]And you have to play the objective.
[292:47.70]I'm surprised I didn't get that, but I stopped spinning.
[293:03.09]so angry I got him okay how did they nerf the Dead Ringer when this fucking disciplinary action whips you out of the danger zone
[293:34.90]How is that nerfed?
[293:40.24]Sounds like a skill issue to me.
[293:41.76]Well, I'm using it right now.
[293:44.76]That's how I noticed for the first time how insane it actually is.
[293:55.77]Heavy is probably the worst possible thing to do, but I'm going to do it.
[294:15.46]Give me that snack.
[294:16.00]Alright, do I?
[294:18.32]I think I have it.
[294:34.72]Damn, he got me.
[294:43.15]Oh.
[294:58.38]Wow.
[295:07.78]I thought there was going to be a spy right behind me.
[295:10.52]There is.
[295:10.86]Turn around.
[295:12.40]Don't do that.
[295:13.02]I really thought you were serious.
[295:16.30]I did see one.
[295:25.16]What the fuck is going on?
[295:27.64]I'm bad.
[295:30.97]Let's just focus, just aim, just actually aim.
[295:38.83]That's a lot of fish.
[295:42.66]There's no way.
[295:43.36]Wait, drop an item.
[295:56.83]Think I'm safe.
[296:06.18]Go!
[296:06.38]I think the sniper is the spy, but it's this guy.
[296:37.05]I can cheat.
[296:40.03]Get out of here.
[297:04.23]We good?
[297:09.79]This guy's got 29?
[297:10.53]Holy shit.
[297:11.29]Are you kidding me?
[297:23.83]What is wrong with you?
[297:25.49]We did it.
[297:39.38]You're having a crisis.
[297:40.28]You're having a meltdown.
[297:41.16]I keep getting killed by spies.
[297:53.98]Hey, we did pretty good.
[297:55.40]That was a good round.
[297:56.86]We won.
[297:59.06]Yeah.
[297:59.58]I'd say pretty good is what you say when you lose, but we actually won.
[298:04.60]Are you liking a spy?
[298:09.38]I'm forgetting that I'm allowed to cheat death and I keep dying.
[298:21.16]Dude, one of these people is a spy.
[298:23.22]I'm certain of it.
[298:35.44]I think we might need a little bit of speed.
[298:40.88]I kind of need to see how bad the ambassador is now for myself.
[298:50.76]Isn't the default revolver like it's really good?
[298:54.25]It's it's pretty good, but it gets like random bullet spread after a shot.
[299:00.55]And uhm.
[299:04.03]I just want to aim it ahead.
[299:13.83]God damn it.
[299:29.84]What?
[299:30.50]14 fishes.
[299:32.06]Alright, this is... Where the fuck is that spot?
[299:40.31]I knew it!
[299:40.87]I knew it!
[299:41.15]I was like, where the fuck did it go?
[299:46.54]What do I want to do?
[299:47.41]I think I'm... Yeah, I'm going for it.
[299:55.24]I'm just going to play it with the... Is it teleport or even... Probably, yeah.
[300:09.99]uh not really not really on this map it helps but it's not the most important thing spawns kind of close what's really important is feeding this seal
[300:51.06]Get the fuck out of here.
[300:52.98]I guess I'll play Pyro.
[301:13.48]Yay!
[301:26.68]I was gonna tape my fucking left mouse button down.
[301:29.44]I'm bad at it.
[301:30.44]I am bad at this one.
[301:49.49]I didn't want to do that.
[301:50.37]Oh my god, dude.
[301:51.79]Give me a fucking break.
[301:58.47]It's so not worth.
[301:59.55]It's so not worth it.
[302:00.98]I believe everyone.
[302:09.72]OK, let's try this.
[302:30.04]Oh, that makes you take crits.
[302:31.16]I forgot, right?
[302:31.96]Does it?
[302:34.11]Oh, yeah.
[302:34.57]You get... Right.
[302:36.59]You take mini crits too.
[302:38.05]That's right.
[302:40.99]Let me put this away.
[302:58.05]I'll do fish.
[302:58.57]I'll try it.
[303:11.51]I'm already fucking dead.
[303:12.67]Uh, what do we need right now?
[303:24.92]We need you to step it up.
[303:27.88]I'm trying.
[303:28.44]I mean, the game is pretty even.
[303:31.66]We don't really specifically need anything.
[303:51.02]Hey.
[303:54.01]Alright.
[303:57.82]That guy almost killed me.
[303:59.14]That guy is good at sniping.
[304:21.43]The seals will start being released in 30 seconds.
[304:32.82]Give me those fishes.
[304:33.74]Fire, fire!
[304:47.60]Three, two, one.
[304:58.98]I want to go on another run.
[305:02.52]A dungeon run?
[305:03.28]Dude, that's some pretty nasty thunder.
[305:17.27]I was like, what the fuck is that sound?
[305:18.67]That was some pretty bad thunder.
[305:22.41]We gotta go feed the seal, bruh!
[305:24.09]Yeah, in real life.
[305:25.43]I saw a flash out my fucking... I was like, what the hell was that?
[305:28.69]And then the thunder rolled in.
[305:31.19]That's why I kind of stopped playing.
[305:33.49]How often do you get, like, storms in Vegas?
[305:36.28]Um, it happens pretty frequently, especially in summertime.
[305:39.58]Not a lot of rain, but we'll get, like, some pretty nasty lightning stuff.
[305:56.80]The big eye thing finally awoke.
[306:06.99]That's enough fish.
[306:24.71]The Vegas Eye.
[306:26.45]Oh, that's scary over there.
[306:29.54]I love the Vegas Eye.
[307:00.44]Whoa, nice.
[307:10.16]What is happening?
[307:12.66]What's happening?
[307:13.25]I don't know.
[307:16.91]And of course, the fucking spy is the one that kills me.
[307:20.69]Out of all that, out of all that horseshit, the spy is the one that gets me.
[307:29.99]I just gotta look at him.
[307:39.71]Oh shit, did you hear that?
[307:41.27]Dude, that was like.
[307:55.46]Holy shit.
[307:58.55]uh if the stream turns off then well I'll see you later bye bye this was really fun though I had a great time I love this game it's fun yeah see you were like I don't know I gotta like maybe play Viewfinder it catches it catches on
[308:21.96]You get into the groove before you know it.
[308:25.13]16 hours have gone by.
[308:26.13]That's very true.
[308:27.39]You lost your health, your job, and your wife.
[308:29.33]I don't want to get random crit.
[308:38.52]I'm going to get this guy.
[308:40.56]I'm going to get this guy.
[308:56.25]You really just let me walk.
[308:57.39]This map is so laggy for me sometimes too.
[308:59.19]I don't know if you feel that.
[309:05.03]I'm sorry.
[309:05.79]I have a lot of distractions over here right now.
[309:08.23]This is the loudest fucking... Oh my god.
[309:12.20]My stream just turned off.
[309:13.66]My stream literally just blinked.
[309:16.72]My computer blinked.
[309:19.12]Oh, you should probably go.
[309:20.20]Alright.
[309:20.60]See you later.
[309:21.02]Goodbye.
[309:21.52]Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[309:22.32]I'm actually going to get the fuck out of here before this gets worse.
[309:25.66]My screen actually turned off for like two seconds.
[309:29.00]Oh, one more kill.
[309:29.84]One more kill.
[309:30.26]One more kill.
[309:30.62]I'll be good.
[309:31.02]You got to do one more life.
[309:31.78]You got to do one more life, dude.
[309:39.19]This map is so... Alright.
[309:42.01]Get out of here.
[309:43.59]Get out of here.
[309:50.56]Oh, time to lay down that lumbar.
[309:54.95]Alright.
[309:57.63]Yeah.
[309:57.85]See you later, everybody.
[309:59.71]Mike, I'm actually probably going to lose power in like a minute or two.
[310:05.68]You keep saying that.
[310:08.50]You still have power.
[310:09.75]That last one was fucking nuts.
[310:11.11]I'm telling you, my computer turned off.
[310:12.13]You gotta get as many kills as you can before the power goes out.
[310:17.43]Holy shit.
[310:18.09]Can you hear this?
[310:19.59]You have to be able to hear that, right?
[310:21.61]I don't hear it.
[310:24.93]I think it's dementia.
[310:26.91]Wow.
[310:28.39]Whoa.
[310:30.70]What the fuck?
[310:31.56]This is crazy.
[310:33.74]What on Earth?
[310:35.90]Okay, I heard that a little bit.
[310:38.40]Can you go, like, hold your mic outside?
[310:40.36]Whoa!
[310:41.64]Holy shit.
[310:42.40]Alright, yeah, I gotta go.
[310:43.80]See you later.
[310:44.36]Goodbye.
[310:45.80]It was fun.
[310:46.10]We should do it again sometime, Ster.
[310:48.08]Thanks for hanging out.
[310:50.31]Yeah, of course.
[310:50.93]Have a great rest of your night, everybody.
[310:52.39]TF2.
[310:53.73]I had a great time.
[310:54.31]It was fun to play it again, for sure.
[310:57.17]Thanks, Ster, for playing.
[311:00.63]I'll talk to you soon.
[311:01.27]Love, Ster.
[311:02.71]Everybody loves Ster.
[311:03.53]Come on.
[311:04.47]I mean, I love the idea of Ster, but Ster is just actually okay.
[311:13.35]Ster is, what's wrong with Ster?
[311:15.64]He's chunky.
[311:16.60]He's thicker and yeah.
[311:19.48]It is actually, I don't know why I like it that much.
[311:28.18]Alright.
[311:28.72]I'm going to get out of here before my computer turns off.
[311:33.03]Take care.
[311:33.59]Alright.
[311:34.07]Thanks, dude.
[311:34.43]Peace out, friend.
[311:37.72]Alright.
[311:38.98]Yeah, we plan on probably stopping around now anyways.
[311:42.94]Team Fortress, though.
[311:45.76]I feel like there was a few good games there.
[311:47.56]I'm not playing for a long time.
[311:49.58]Alright, the next time I play it, I'll play it again.
[311:51.68]Maybe we'll open some crates and chill and play it.
[311:54.90]Maybe the next time.
[311:56.08]Next stream is probably going to be... Damn.
[312:01.63]This is fucking crazy.
[312:05.08]Next stream is probably going to be on Wednesday or Thursday.
[312:08.16]I'll let you know.
[312:08.62]Keep an eye on the sus.
[312:12.46]And see you later.
[312:13.60]Take care.
[312:14.72]Have a great night.
[312:16.48]And goodbye.
[312:17.68]Call your mother.
