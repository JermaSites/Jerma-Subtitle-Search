[ve:60.16.100]

[00:03.63]Okay.
[00:05.87]Here I am.
[00:07.95]And I have done some audio tweaking.
[00:10.65]Here I am.
[00:11.44]I'm right here.
[00:15.48]How does the audio sound?
[00:17.16]Do we sound a little smooth?
[00:18.96]Do we sound a little better?
[00:20.80]How do we sound?
[00:24.31]Let's give it a little bit of a yell test.
[00:26.77]Let's give a scream test here.
[00:27.93]I think that's a good idea.
[00:33.35]So if I were to make a weird noise, if I were to go... That doesn't get fucked up, right?
[00:43.47]I sound way better.
[00:44.73]Okay, how about this one?
[00:47.39]I'm gonna make a loud sound.
[00:48.56]Well, actually, no, I'm not gonna do that yet.
[00:49.68]I don't wanna do that yet.
[00:55.76]You sound like classic Jerma.
[00:57.58]Oh, classic Jerma!
[01:04.01]You wanna know why you think I sound like classic Jerma?
[01:06.75]Because there's no compressor, there's no noise gate, and there's no noise suppression.
[01:13.20]This is just mic out of the fucking box.
[01:17.34]Okay?
[01:25.44]It's just right out of the box.
[01:31.85]No... No more filter Andy, okay?
[01:40.40]You're a little on the quiet side.
[01:42.76]Yeah, I probably can turn it up a little bit more.
[01:45.22]I'm kind of afraid to, though.
[01:51.54]Yeah, there's no more noise gate.
[01:52.82]So you're gonna be able to hear my fucking ear.
[01:54.76]You're gonna be able to hear my weird burps and farts and shit.
[01:57.67]You're gonna be able to hear everything.
[02:01.53]Turn it up by, like, 10%.
[02:07.24]Should I turn it up by about 10%?
[02:08.50]What do you think?
[02:09.04]I need a unanimous decision.
[02:11.14]Can we get a vote in chat, please?
[02:14.72]Should I turn the microphone up by, like, 10%?
[02:22.76]You definitely heard that.
[02:23.56]I just, like, gulped three times.
[02:25.26]I'm so used to being able to... Oh, God.
[02:26.62]This is going to be bad.
[02:28.80]I am... You definitely heard that too!
[02:31.12]You definitely heard the... I'm so used to you guys not hearing any of these sounds for the last like four fucking straight years.
[02:39.44]Just mute when I breathe in?
[02:41.02]Huh?
[02:42.70]What do you think?
[02:48.14]Microphone up to... Alright, unanimous.
[02:49.72]Alright, you tell me.
[02:51.42]Microphone... The microphone's going up by 10%.
[02:53.28]Tell me if this is good.
[03:00.28]You ready?
[03:08.27]Okay, here we go.
[03:09.27]Mic's going up by 10%.
[03:11.39]I just did it.
[03:12.21]Just did about 10%.
[03:13.45]Do we need more, or is that good?
[03:16.15]I just did about 10%.
[03:17.41]How's that?
[03:17.75]Are we okay?
[03:22.28]Good, good.
[03:23.36]Let's do some testing.
[03:24.36]I need you guys to listen, because it's hard to do it myself, because I speech jam myself.
[03:27.38]Listen, ready?
[03:27.76]Ready?
[03:37.77]how's that oh is that loud is that getting cut off is it is it peaking but it's pulling it back how is it how does it sound is it okay does that is that like bad to listen to because there's screams but you know nobody wants to hear a real loud ass scream right
[04:01.76]I can hear the bacteria forming in your mouth.
[04:08.25]Okay.
[04:09.09]So it sounds okay?
[04:11.21]Turn the compression on.
[04:12.46]I am not turning the compression on.
[04:14.14]I'm gonna get... You know what it is?
[04:16.56]Here's the problem.
[04:17.76]I am going to get a hardware compressor.
[04:21.88]I'm gonna get a hardware compressor.
[04:24.16]I've been using software compression for four or five years.
[04:27.13]A hardware compressor, I have to get one.
[04:29.87]They're a huge pain in the ass, but fucking whatever.
[04:33.21]But do I really even give a shit, though?
[04:35.81]Like, honestly, ask me.
[04:37.27]Do I really give a shit to buy a hardware compressor into like a fucking amp and then put that into a fucking... I don't know.
[04:46.51]Does it matter?
[04:47.29]Is this fine?
[04:51.62]Okay.
[04:54.92]Software compressors are better.
[04:57.52]Alright, well then whatever.
[04:58.24]I don't care.
[04:59.42]I've never been like an audio person, right?
[05:03.51]You could try a limiter filter in OBS.
[05:05.51]That's what I had on before, unfortunately.
[05:07.10]And it just kind of was deleting the sounds.
[05:11.64]Alright, it's okay.
[05:12.30]Let's go.
[05:12.54]I'll tell you what we're going to do today.
[05:14.04]I'll tell you the plan.
[05:15.56]We've got some stuff going on.
[05:18.20]Eat 40 sausages on stream.
[05:19.98]No, I'm not going to do that.
[05:25.18]There's no difference between a hardware and a software compressor?
[05:29.00]No.
[05:31.98]Your volume keeps fluctuating?
[05:33.24]Well, that's because I'm sitting back in the chair and then I kind of go like this and I lean in for a second.
[05:37.35]And it sounds kind of like one of those microphones where I'm going to tell you all about something.
[05:44.41]I moved the microphone.
[05:45.15]The volume's not going to be like going... I'm going to be sitting still.
[05:53.96]Dude, back the fuck up.
[05:55.26]I'm backing up.
[05:56.62]I'm backed up right now.
[05:59.59]You should play Ring Fit.
[06:01.01]No, that would require me to get up and move around!
[06:03.07]Alright, you guys ready?
[06:07.46]First thing we're gonna do... We're gonna do Who Wants to be a Millionaire?
[06:12.72]Uh... Weirdly enough, all these games are on Switch.
[06:23.13]I- Honestly, trying to find these game show games is such a huge pain in the ass.
[06:28.91]They only are in casinos as slot machines, or on Xbox Live Arcade from 2010.
[06:34.05]They all- They're all on, like, the random consoles, though.
[06:38.91]Like, this is on Switch.
[06:41.35]Yeah, or they're- It's- I don't get it.
[06:43.71]Like, Deal or No Deal?
[06:45.37]Deal or No Deal is, like, only on, like, MSN's webpage.
[06:52.90]This was, like, one of the most popular fucking TV shows of all time, right?
[06:57.70]Why... Why is there only, like, two places that are, like, random old Flash players that you can play this?
[07:08.07]Where do I get Deal or No Deal, an actual developed video game?
[07:11.21]Well, I guess it... I mean, literally, it's open a hundred cases and look at it.
[07:14.27]I guess you don't really need to spend that much time on it.
[07:19.81]It's on the DS.
[07:21.33]Yeah, but that's what I'm saying.
[07:22.29]It's on the fucking Nintendo DS.
[07:26.18]Why would this not be on every console?
[07:29.30]Deal or no deal was really dumb.
[07:34.66]Well, I have it, okay?
[07:37.78]The DS has it.
[07:39.02]And guess what?
[07:39.62]You can't... Whatever.
[07:43.58]Game show popularity.
[07:45.43]Wait, what'd you say?
[07:47.69]Game show popularity must be dying out for the newer generations.
[07:53.26]I guess that makes sense.
[07:54.84]I can understand that.
[07:55.56]Yeah, that makes some sense.
[07:56.32]Alright, well, we're going to play Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
[07:59.98]I'm ready.
[08:00.30]You guys ready?
[08:02.82]Let's go ahead and do it.
[08:07.62]And let's go.
[08:11.98]What's up?
[08:13.67]New camera spot, too.
[08:14.77]I'm no longer getting blocked by any shadows or anything.
[08:17.13]I'm just sitting here.
[08:17.79]I'm here.
[08:18.19]Here I am.
[08:22.89]Much better lighting, too.
[08:23.97]I took this very, very seriously.
[08:25.46]I took this dead seriously.
[08:31.52]It's too zoomed in.
[08:37.76]You're not zoomed in.
[08:45.62]You're getting even closer to the Northern Lion shot.
[08:54.79]I mean, this is an ideal place for a microphone and a fucking webcam.
[09:07.25]Okay, you guys ready?
[09:09.01]I'm gonna play Deal or No Deal.
[09:11.51]I don't really need audio for this, do I?
[09:14.87]No, I don't care.
[09:15.39]Alright, let's go.
[09:18.05]These are all the categories.
[09:19.01]I know how to play Millionaire.
[09:21.67]I understand how to play the game Millionaire.
[09:23.87]It's fine.
[09:32.41]Oh, by the way, how queued up are the sounds?
[09:36.02]Are the sounds good?
[09:37.58]Let me do a test, because capturing this through a capture card is weird.
[09:40.58]Ready?
[09:41.01]Like... One.
[09:43.75]Two.
[09:45.43]Three.
[09:48.53]Ready?
[09:49.39]So I'm going to set... Oh.
[09:52.27]Hey, good thing!
[09:53.72]Hey, look at that!
[09:55.04]Wheel of Fortune's coming up soon!
[09:56.84]Because I just fucking started downloading it like 40 minutes ago.
[10:00.36]That's why I spent so long getting here.
[10:03.64]Because this was taking a long time to download all these, because I had this all on PC, but I realized, wow, none of these fucking games are on PC unless you go to some weird website.
[10:12.23]Oh, okay, so let me go plug in my Xbox from fucking 2011.
[10:15.15]Let me go get my Xbox 360 and plug it in and go to Xbox Arcade.
[10:18.35]No, these are on Switch.
[10:19.44]So let me go get them all on Switch and then start the stream fucking 40 minutes late.
[10:29.38]You're stalling, yeah.
[10:32.13]There's no game sound?
[10:33.47]Yes, there is.
[10:34.03]You can hear it right now.
[10:39.10]Okay, so.
[10:42.12]We're going to do a test here.
[10:43.36]Ready?
[10:43.56]Does that sound fine?
[10:51.13]It's quiet.
[10:52.53]You guys, do you guys really want to hear?
[10:53.89]Okay, let me just do it.
[10:55.29]Let me just tell you what this music's going to be like.
[10:57.11]It's going to go... Who cares?
[11:03.82]It's the same fucking sound effect you've heard for like 20 years.
[11:10.06]Is it delayed?
[11:11.99]Are you wearing a prosthetic nose?
[11:15.52]Oh, fuck.
[11:16.24]I just like scratched my nose.
[11:17.56]What the?
[11:18.02]Shut up.
[11:18.96]Alright, let's go.
[11:19.64]I'm going to be... My nails are too long.
[11:23.08]I need time.
[11:24.90]I need extra time before... I need extra time before stream.
[11:28.41]Alright, let's play as... Does it even matter?
[11:32.61]Alright, we're going to play as Ruben.
[11:40.10]Good thing you could hear the claps, right, everybody?
[11:43.41]Good thing I could hear the claps.
[11:45.81]Turn it up.
[11:50.21]You know what?
[11:50.53]I was told to turn it up.
[11:51.37]I hope this is loud.
[11:52.84]Because everyone's... I fucking told you.
[11:55.62]Oh, yeah.
[11:56.08]This is the thing you all needed to hear so loudly.
[11:58.08]Yeah, okay.
[12:15.01]Alright, let's go.
[12:18.05]I don't care.
[12:21.27]So, if you don't know how to play... Everyone knows how to play Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.
[12:24.69]I don't have to describe it.
[12:27.02]But what common name is the harmonica also known?
[12:32.00]I don't know.
[12:33.46]The mouth organ?
[12:37.26]The mouth organ.
[12:40.03]I'm going to choose B.
[12:44.73]Why would it be anything else?
[12:58.86]In a game of poker dice, a throw resulting in three of a kind in one pair is called what?
[13:05.24]Poker dice?
[13:06.08]What do you mean poker dice?
[13:09.41]That's just a full house.
[13:13.42]Why would you just say poker?
[13:14.95]Poker dice?
[13:16.89]What the fuck is poker dice?
[13:26.11]Why don't you say poker?
[13:30.78]They have to talk.
[13:33.00]They don't have to, right?
[13:34.60]Can I turn it off?
[13:36.98]In physics, what color comes next in the visible light spectrum after red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo?
[13:44.87]Easy.
[13:47.06]Violet.
[13:49.86]I'm not going to cheat.
[13:52.74]I promise I'm not cheating.
[14:01.22]You can tell if I'm cheating because I moved my shit around, right?
[14:04.84]Chat used to be over here.
[14:07.08]Chat is now over here.
[14:09.48]And my stream settings and preview stuff is over here.
[14:13.84]Okay?
[14:14.58]Well, no, no.
[14:15.16]Actually, it's right there.
[14:16.64]You're both like right... So if I'm looking over here, if I go like this, I am looking at you guys.
[14:24.95]What's the question?
[14:25.53]What did the Lumiere brothers invent?
[14:27.65]I'm lost.
[14:28.37]I'm lost.
[14:31.87]Not electricity, photography.
[14:35.92]I don't know.
[14:38.10]Photography or cinema?
[14:40.38]Whatever.
[14:40.62]Yeah, if you see me do this, I'm looking over a chat.
[14:49.56]This is me.
[14:50.36]Okay.
[14:50.68]I'm gonna give you the spectrum here of looking and when I am not looking at the actual game.
[14:58.82]Looking at the game.
[14:59.52]Looking at the game.
[15:00.22]Looking at the game.
[15:00.90]Looking at the game.
[15:01.56]Looking at the game.
[15:02.39]Looking at the chat is right here.
[15:05.75]You understand?
[15:08.15]Looking at the chat is right here.
[15:11.75]I'll give you this side.
[15:12.37]Ready?
[15:13.59]Looking at the game.
[15:14.35]Nothing's over here.
[15:14.87]Doesn't matter.
[15:23.63]That's just a warm-up.
[15:24.37]Who cares?
[15:25.51]Nobody can beat this game anyways because they give some random ass trivia that nobody knows after the $1,000 threshold.
[15:33.87]All the questions are just random shit that you would have to look up in a book.
[15:38.66]Is that copium?
[15:39.30]I don't think it is.
[15:46.80]Why is my hair so big today?
[15:48.04]Because I put hairspray in it.
[15:51.12]Alright, let's go.
[15:51.58]Here we go.
[15:52.88]I gotta get to at least a thousand.
[15:54.18]At least a thousand.
[15:56.62]Which of these is a national holiday in the USA held on the fourth Thursday in November?
[16:03.44]For a second, that's like freaking me out.
[16:06.66]Okay, what everyday object is a ball cock most likely to be found?
[16:19.03]Isn't that badminton?
[16:24.71]A ball cock?
[16:34.48]What the fuck is a... What is a ball cock?
[16:39.20]Definitely not... Definitely not teapot.
[16:42.14]Not a telephone.
[16:43.02]It's probably toilet.
[16:44.04]Yeah, but...
[16:54.04]Toaster.
[16:56.32]It's in a toaster.
[16:57.44]Okay, what word describes a period with very little rainfall?
[17:03.20]That would be a drought.
[17:11.49]You know, they have all this dialogue, but I would wish they would just read the questions.
[17:15.35]Oh, yes.
[17:17.57]You make it look easy.
[17:19.02]I wish I could just have TTS do it, right?
[17:21.32]I don't want to read this.
[17:22.15]I want to hear it.
[17:22.65]Here's a new question for you.
[17:25.40]State of Wyoming is in which time zone?
[17:27.46]Oh, shit.
[17:29.42]Is that Pacific or is it Mountain?
[17:32.22]That's not Central.
[17:32.92]It's Mountain.
[17:34.34]This might be a trick question, though.
[17:35.46]I think it's Mountain.
[17:36.18]It's Mountain.
[17:36.68]No, it has to be.
[17:37.88]There's no way.
[17:38.66]If it's not Mountain time, then I'm... Yeah, there's no way.
[17:43.84]That would be the Cardinals.
[17:50.71]The St.
[17:51.21]Louis Bishops.
[17:54.96]Bless you.
[17:55.26]There's no... I told you, there's no noise gate anymore.
[18:05.23]You're gonna fucking hear everything.
[18:07.49]In weight measurement, what does 14 pounds equal?
[18:12.34]I don't know.
[18:14.10]It's not a peck.
[18:16.36]No, a stone.
[18:17.18]A score.
[18:17.72]I don't know.
[18:20.18]I don't know.

[18:21.70]I don't know.
[18:22.04]I don't know.
[18:22.32]I don't know.
[18:22.70]Ask the audience.
[18:24.32]That's how you do it.
[18:24.78]Okay, it's a stone.
[18:25.28]A stone is way less than 14 fucking pounds.
[18:27.08]A stone.
[18:27.38]A stone.
[18:27.60]A stone is maybe one pound.
[18:44.18]A stone.
[18:45.06]That's a rock.
[18:45.54]You know what I mean, though?
[18:50.65]It's a stone.
[18:52.43]Whatever.

[20:58.08]It's a pleasure to have you on the phone.
[21:00.06]How do they do this?
[21:00.66]You need a helping hand for a very delicate question.
[21:03.90]We're counting on you.

[21:22.76]Uncle pulls through.
[21:23.72]Alright.
[21:24.74]Uncle pulls through.
[21:27.78]Where are we at right now?
[21:29.40]Will you be able to answer this new question as well?
[21:32.41]At the first modern Olympic Games in Athens, victors were given a crown of what leaves?
[21:38.55]Olive, orange, laurel, or bay leaves?
[21:48.35]Olive?
[21:55.84]Olive leaves?
[21:58.66]I don't know.
[21:59.60]I'm going to do 50-50.
[22:02.08]If Olive is there.
[22:04.32]Alright, it's Olive.
[22:05.70]Do Olives have leaves?
[22:10.02]Alright, they do.
[22:15.95]32,000.
[22:16.09]We're good.
[22:19.89]I'm not cheating.
[22:20.63]I fucking promise you.
[22:25.23]Concentrate.
[22:26.29]Here's a new question for you.
[22:28.07]What was Kubla Khan's relationship to Genghis Khan?
[22:33.30]Oh my goodness, I have no idea.
[22:39.18]I want to say son.
[22:41.00]Or grandson.
[22:51.35]Son or grandson.
[22:55.97]I still have lifelines.
[22:58.37]This is way too kind of... I don't know.
[22:59.63]This is too vague for me.
[23:00.53]Like, father, brother, son, grandson.
[23:02.51]It could be literally any of these.
[23:06.85]What this one is... What's this one?
[23:09.97]I think... Oh, this is new question, right?
[23:11.58]Yeah.
[23:12.04]It could be any one of these, honest to God.
[23:13.98]I just don't know.
[23:14.70]How do you say court in Spanish?
[23:43.98]Why do I only have 10 seconds?
[23:48.42]Durado.
[23:48.80]That's the only one that sounds like a mosaic.
[23:51.37]Juzgado.
[23:52.79]That's true.
[23:53.05]What do I leave with?
[23:53.51]32,000.
[23:53.53]That's not bad.
[24:13.86]Chat was wrong again.
[24:14.64]I don't know Spanish.
[24:22.50]32K, yeah.
[24:23.34]Oh, the voice actor.
[24:26.14]The one that's like, master.
[24:28.42]What's that character's name?
[24:35.51]Genos, yeah.
[24:37.76]I think this is the Genos voice actor from the One Punch Man dub.
[24:44.58]I hear it.
[24:50.79]I can hear it.
[24:56.92]What a great show, by the way.
[24:58.85]See, that's season one.
[24:59.71]Season one.
[25:00.21]Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.
[25:01.69]Season one.
[25:03.37]Alright, let's play with a different character.
[25:04.99]How about... How about Massimo?
[25:17.02]I've never even seen season two, by the way.
[25:18.48]I have no idea how it is.
[25:19.48]I'm just jumping on the bandwagon with everybody that said they don't like it.
[25:23.91]I've never seen it.
[25:28.29]Okay.
[25:29.15]Let's go.
[25:32.46]If a comedian is very funny, where would the audience be said to be rolling?
[25:37.08]In the aisle.
[25:38.14]Down your way.
[25:38.98]Over the top.
[25:39.64]Up the wall.
[25:40.92]I don't... Who fucking even says this anymore?
[25:44.46]Rolling in the aisles, right?
[25:50.41]No, this is wrong.
[25:51.81]If the audience is laughing, where would they be laughing?
[25:53.79]They're laughing their ass off.
[25:56.89]What would the audience be laughing off of their body?
[25:59.53]These questions are from like 50 years ago.
[26:03.09]When someone is not as fierce as they sound, what is said to be worse than their bite?
[26:07.23]Their bark.
[26:11.03]And Massimo chooses D. That's one.
[26:14.53]Final answer?
[26:15.19]You're so old.
[26:17.13]No swearing on TV.
[26:19.49]That is correct.
[26:21.01]Are we sure?
[26:21.69]Listen, hold on.
[26:22.43]I believed it to the end.
[26:24.15]I did a good job.
[26:27.77]Your new question is ready.
[26:29.63]Good luck.
[26:31.61]Are you sure it's not Genos?
[26:36.45]A hit by Gladys Knight in the Pips was titled Midnight Train to Georgia.
[26:41.68]No, but that one's the right answer.
[26:44.36]I'm gonna say B. So this is your final answer?
[26:50.46]Yes.
[26:50.66]It's not The VA is Too Young.
[26:52.17]That's my final answer.
[26:55.39]Okay.
[26:55.51]Well done.
[26:56.27]You got it.
[26:58.76]This game's too loud.
[26:59.42]I had to turn it down.
[27:00.56]How come everybody's British?
[27:01.62]I don't know.
[27:08.24]The four C's of diamond quality are color, cut, carrot, and quality.
[27:13.55]Carbon.
[27:14.53]Clarity.
[27:15.55]It's definitely clarity.
[27:17.39]It's clarity.
[27:18.13]Has to be, right?
[27:19.07]Or is it cost?
[27:19.83]No, it's clarity.
[27:21.41]I'm not looking.
[27:22.35]I know everyone's freaking out.
[27:23.39]It's definitely color, cut, carrot, clarity.
[27:25.84]My gut says that it's C. Okay, C. Yes.
[27:31.92]You are right.
[27:33.93]Comorbid.
[27:37.43]What is go- I'm gonna watch that movie to see what the fuck everyone's talking about.
[27:41.24]What are you all talking about?
[27:42.36]Is the movie- Is it a bad movie?
[27:44.60]Does the movie suck?
[27:45.56]Is it a bad film?
[27:47.28]I don't get it.
[27:48.62]Which of these is gravy usually served?
[27:51.02]Gravy boat.
[27:55.07]I'm going to choose D. I fucking can't.
[28:02.29]Alright, let's go.
[28:07.15]Now this is where the questions get harder.
[28:08.30]I don't want to use any lifelines until 32,000.
[28:12.12]Eric Cartman is a character on which animated TV series?
[28:14.44]King of the Hill.
[28:16.62]See, that was easier than the $100 one.
[28:17.72]Seriously.
[28:17.94]Final.
[28:24.03]What does it know Eric Cartman?
[28:29.08]Who's currently, like, alive right now.
[28:31.24]You know what I mean?
[28:31.96]This is exactly what I was talking about.
[28:36.22]The question before this, before $1,000.
[28:37.36]What TV show is Eric Cartman on?
[28:48.47]Now this very specific racetrack in the country.
[28:52.77]Where is it?
[28:53.35]I don't know.
[28:53.85]Who would even know this?
[28:54.81]I don't know.
[28:57.15]I kind of have to do this.
[29:00.96]You decided to appeal to the audience.
[29:04.76]Kentucky.
[29:06.54]I was going to say, I would say probably not New York.
[29:09.82]Let's go for C. But I would have been throwing a coin in the air.
[29:15.50]You are right.
[29:17.24]It's famous.
[29:19.40]Obviously not fam- not as famous as Eric Cartman, apparently.
[29:24.81]Alicante is on which Spanish coast?
[29:31.41]Do you hear these people?

[29:44.86]Coaster... Coaster... Coaster... Coaster... Coaster Blocker!

[32:13.33]I have a good hunch that it's C.
[32:18.75]I mean, it starts with a P. I don't know.
[32:26.79]If I was... If somebody were to talk about a technique that I was doing, it would be like... Like, Germanism or something.
[32:33.38]Whatever.
[32:36.40]If I made a technique up, it would be called, like...
[32:45.81]I don't think I'm ever going to get a million dollars here.
[32:49.28]These questions are too hard.
[32:53.80]That was as easy to me as the Eric Cartman question.
[32:57.80]Really?
[32:58.10]I want to unlock the Harry Potter questions.
[33:02.10]I'll get all those right.
[33:04.83]Like, can I just do Harry Potter and Star Wars?

[33:54.61]It would be glee.
[34:12.33]You don't know what Glee is?
[34:13.27]I swear to God that's Genos.
[34:14.85]It has to be.
[34:15.49]If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong completely.
[34:18.69]But I keep hearing it.
[34:19.69]In which of these sports is a checkered flag normally used?

[34:59.85]It's not Alabama.
[35:01.33]It is Arkansas.
[35:02.39]I'm going to choose D. You're literally speedrunning.
[35:06.21]You have to speedrun these first five questions.
[35:09.95]Children can answer these correct.
[35:11.79]Phew.
[35:13.00]Okay, here we go.
[35:16.09]Camp David is the country retreat of which public fantasy president of the United States?
[35:22.39]These are easy.

[35:31.47]Okay, here we are.
[35:32.85]A popular children's novel by Cressida Cowell is titled How to Train Your Dragon.
[35:37.07]I only know that because of the movie.
[35:45.52]I haven't even seen that movie, by the way.
[35:46.96]These are easy.
[35:47.46]How to train your monkey.

[36:13.38]Jupiter has a big fucking spot on it.
[36:15.06]Jupiter has a big spot on it.
[36:16.44]Alright, I got all my lifelines.
[36:19.46]I've known all these answers.
[36:34.02]Concentrate.
[36:35.02]Here's a new question for you.
[36:36.56]The Normans who invaded and conquered England in 1066 spoke which language?
[36:43.37]The Normans.
[36:53.63]Norwegian?
[36:55.09]The Normans?
[36:56.65]Danish?
[36:57.11]Norwegian?
[36:57.85]I don't know.
[37:00.70]I'm going to say Norwegian.
[37:02.42]If it was Norwegian or Danish.
[37:04.26]I'm going to say Danish.
[37:07.25]I don't know.
[37:07.81]I don't know.
[37:08.61]I have to do it.
[37:12.27]What the fuck?
[37:13.13]Jerma?
[37:14.25]They're not going to screw me over here, are they?
[37:18.32]What the fuck are you talking about?
[37:20.32]They all got it wrong.
[37:21.78]That was 40 and 49%.
[37:22.83]So you mean to tell me that 89% of the entire audience didn't know?
[37:26.59]What?
[37:26.75]That never happens.
[37:52.56]Dermot, where is Normandy?
[37:58.92]I don't know.
[37:59.42]For some reason, I was thinking, like, a thousand years ago or something.
[38:03.64]Like, 5,000 years ago.
[38:05.24]Like, the Normans.
[38:07.83]I don't know.
[38:08.39]I figured that they were some other... I don't know.
[38:13.57]N.A.
[38:13.87]Education.
[38:14.67]I have not been sitting in a... Okay.
[38:17.93]Okay.
[38:19.93]It's for all you young kids out there can.
[38:23.65]Okay, I get it.
[38:25.05]Oh, dude, you went to high school.
[38:27.14]You went to like college.
[38:28.34]I went to high school.
[38:29.44]I went to like college.
[38:30.84]Dude, you probably have been in a classroom.
[38:35.48]Honestly, there are people probably in this chat right now where their entire life has gone by and I have not been in a classroom.
[38:42.64]I haven't been in a classroom in like 17 or 18 years.
[38:44.06]It's been that long.
[38:47.47]It's only been like probably two years for you.
[38:49.53]It might have been like maybe four or five years since you've been in a classroom.
[38:52.08]I haven't been in a classroom in fucking 20 years.
[38:57.10]So it's shocking that I know some of these.
[38:59.64]It just speaks to my incredible intelligence that I can get these correct.
[39:03.29]Some of these.
[39:04.91]A portion of them.
[39:05.87]A small portion of them.
[39:18.91]I turned 41 this year.
[39:20.53]So, please.
[39:21.83]I haven't been in a classroom in like fucking 25 years.
[39:29.89]And yeah, excuse me.
[39:31.08]Somebody just said it.
[39:31.76]I've said this before too.
[39:33.10]Memorization does not equal retention.
[39:36.28]I'm sorry.
[39:36.68]That's not real retention of knowledge.
[39:38.58]Who wants to be a millionaire?
[39:40.08]Are you ready to play today?
[39:42.42]Okay, let's go.
[39:50.57]Memorizing something for, like, one week to just get it on the- Okay, that's what it is.
[39:54.10]It's not knowledge retention.
[39:55.38]You know what knowledge retention is?
[39:56.42]What are you talking about?
[40:01.26]This guy was a teacher.
[40:02.24]I was never a teacher.
[40:03.26]I was a- Alright, quiet.
[40:05.42]Which of these is a type of narrow-legged trousers?
[40:11.29]What?
[40:19.33]A hose pipe?
[40:21.41]Drain pipe?
[40:22.23]Narrow-legged trousers for the first question?
[40:27.11]What would you normally find a set of in a golf bag?
[40:30.33]Irons.
[40:45.93]Oh, it is irons.
[40:47.17]It actually is irons.
[40:49.77]It's irons.
[40:51.23]I don't know why I was thinking like a bunch of heavy iron scrap.
[40:54.83]It is irons.
[40:55.59]I thought they were going to say clubs, not irons.
[41:01.83]The North American bison is commonly known by which name?
[41:05.48]Oh, I know this.
[41:06.10]Buffalo.
[41:06.28]So you weren't a teacher.
[41:15.73]I I was a substitute teacher for like a tiny portion of my life which musical group is famous for wearing theatrical makeup kiss I'm going to choose d you pulled it off you lied about it
[41:37.91]I swear to God.
[41:39.75]What a dumb thing to lie about.
[41:41.89]What a stupid fucking thing to lie about.
[41:44.28]I can't think of a dumber thing to lie about where, you know, I was a substitute teacher before.
[41:48.30]Why would you lie about that?
[41:50.20]What do you gain?
[41:51.56]What do you gain from that?
[41:54.84]Am I looking at you?
[41:55.98]It's like too bright to see.
[41:57.01]Alright.
[41:58.75]What is the indefinite article in the phrase a happy new year?
[42:01.61]I have no fucking idea.
[42:04.14]Indefinite.
[42:05.32]Would be happy, right?
[42:06.10]Because you could be sad.
[42:08.28]And that's not completely definite.
[42:10.52]You could be unhappy.
[42:16.41]Or is that the constant?
[42:19.15]No, it's... No, it could be a different year.
[42:21.42]I don't fucking know.
[42:37.86]Don't say bro.
[42:38.69]Okay, really?
[42:48.95]Let me... Let me drop some knowledge on you guys right now.
[42:52.80]I'm sorry, but... And currently, this is...
[42:57.78]I don't need to know much.
[42:59.30]I don't know much about this.
[43:00.56]I don't know much about this.
[43:03.47]I don't know much about this or this.
[43:07.75]But damn, man, superheroes, TV series, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Disney.
[43:13.02]I want to flip these questions.
[43:15.77]And I'll tell you, if I tweeted right now, if I tweeted a scientific equation right now, I'd get fucking 200 likes.
[43:24.35]If I tweeted a reaction to the latest Star Wars fucking trailer, I'd get 100,000 likes.
[43:28.83]You understand?
[43:41.23]We gotta make this cool again.
[43:44.01]We gotta make these things cool.
[43:46.71]Otherwise, I'm just gonna tweet about fucking Captain America and talk about Captain America and everyone's gonna think I'm the smartest person in the room.
[44:11.46]Somebody said, dude, not one person thinks like that.
[44:20.17]I fucking bet you anything.
[44:21.95]I bet you anything.
[44:23.15]If I were to tweet, if I were to tweet a math problem, if people would be like, this is dumb.
[44:28.65]But if I tweeted a picture of, just I'm talking a math problem, an interesting math problem.
[44:33.53]If I tweeted a picture of me going like this.
[44:37.46]to like a picture of Captain America with a shield on, it would have, people would say like, oh, base is, oh yeah, I love that.
[44:43.80]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[44:45.02]Nerve wracking.
[44:45.42]I'm going to bet on B. That's the one.
[44:51.54]I think we all agree that we can move on.
[44:54.12]I bet you anything.
[44:59.87]Math isn't funny.
[45:04.99]Hmm.
[45:12.37]A tennis match is set into sets.
[45:14.95]Dude, you need to prove this.
[45:24.68]No, I'm not going to tweet about Morbius.
[45:29.89]It's so funny because somebody was like, dude, science is cool.

[46:15.90]And he's blocking a punch from fucking, I don't know, Morbius.
[46:20.52]And on the shield is a complex math problem.

[49:11.91]But listen, it's summer and winter.
[49:14.45]I know, I know.
[49:15.25]But what happened was I went like this and my eye caught the chat and I saw four a dozen times and I was like, fuck, I accidentally cheated and I got it wrong.
[49:25.83]And then you made me second-guess I was gonna do two.

[51:44.92]American author Zane Grey was known for writing what type of novels?
[51:50.11]I don't know.
[51:50.51]I have no idea.
[51:55.53]You know how many books there are?
[51:59.74]Zane Gray.
[52:04.81]Romance?
[52:05.23]I don't... There's no way I would know this.
[52:08.59]I read A Song of Ice and Fire and then cried when 10 years went by and we didn't get another one.
[52:12.96]So that's it.
[52:13.60]I don't do any of the reading.
[52:14.72]I mean, do you count the back of cereal boxes and food just to read random shit that's on the back?
[52:23.23]Do you count, like, reading the toothpaste?
[52:26.69]Like, just the back of the toothpaste?
[52:29.19]Just because you just need to... Oh my fucking god, give me a break.
[52:32.24]It's... I don't know.
[52:34.42]I'm just gonna have to go with this one.
[52:35.88]Phew.
[52:47.51]In which sport... That was weirdly quiet.
[52:49.39]In which sport did the USA's dream team compete in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics?
[52:53.79]Is hockey or basketball?
[52:55.65]I think it was basketball.
[52:58.69]Which one is it?
[52:59.45]It's basketball.
[53:00.35]I think it's basketball.
[53:01.73]It's definitely... It's basketball.
[53:02.79]I know.
[53:03.03]It's basketball.
[53:03.57]The dream team, right?
[53:04.71]Yeah, it's basketball.
[53:07.15]Hockey, they won... It was a different Olympics.
[53:10.87]Different team.
[53:11.32]Okay.
[53:16.98]You will be asked a new question now.
[53:20.19]A vehicle with an S international plate comes from which European country?
[53:27.37]It could be any of them.
[53:31.09]It could be literally any of these.
[53:35.08]How would I know?
[53:38.78]I'm not from a European country.
[53:42.62]And I don't... How would I know?
[53:44.59]Why would I know this?
[53:45.85]I need a new question.
[53:50.76]By using the switch, you decide to be wise.
[53:54.19]Which is it?
[53:55.11]Was it Sweden?
[53:56.99]It was Sweden.
[53:58.19]I would have probably said Sweden, but it could have been easily one of the other ones.
[54:01.41]Very easily.
[54:02.01]Alright, come on.
[54:04.60]Concentrate.
[54:05.62]Here's a new question for you.
[54:07.32]Beta vulgaris is the Latin name of which plant often used in salads?
[54:13.22]Alright, which of these are in a salad?
[54:14.73]Beets...
[54:17.34]It's definitely arugula.
[54:19.10]Vulgaris, arugula.
[54:20.52]There's a U and L and a G in that.
[54:22.35]It's definitely... It has to be.
[54:24.63]It's arugula.
[54:25.35]It has to be.
[54:25.97]It literally has three or four of the same letters.
[54:28.41]What a pity.
[54:31.15]This is the wrong answer.
[54:33.57]No regrets, really.
[54:35.25]I did my best.
[54:37.32]Beta doesn't mean... Beta is like Latin for of or the.
[54:42.18]What is beta?
[54:42.96]I don't know.
[54:43.42]Beta means like...
[54:45.25]I don't know, does that mean beat in Latin?
[54:50.75]You're telling me beta means beat in Latin?
[54:57.36]It's just a B, man.
[55:06.00]Vulgaris means common.
[55:09.08]Beta means beginning.
[55:14.84]Why would you know that?
[55:15.70]Nobody knows that.
[55:17.66]Nobody fucking knows that.
[55:26.18]Nobody fucking knows that.
[55:28.49]Oh, uh, Beta.
[55:30.03]Oh, Vulgarius is the scientific Latin name for beets.
[55:34.92]I just eat them.
[55:36.02]I don't... I'm sorry, guys.
[55:37.64]I don't eat beets in my salad and then go look up everything about a beet and, like, where it came from and what you call it in every other language.
[55:44.08]I just eat it.
[55:44.64]It's a beet and it tastes good.
[55:46.78]Okay, here we go.
[55:47.99]What city is the home of Major League Baseball's Yankees?
[55:50.55]That would be the New York Yankees.
[55:52.33]Well, I'm going to try A.
[55:59.30]Yeah, get you in the hot seat and see how you do.
[56:02.63]This new question shouldn't give you a hard time in theory.
[56:05.45]Which king had two of his wives executed?
[56:07.49]I just, when I saw which king, the first thing that came to my mind was Burger King.
[56:12.77]And then I read the rest of the sentence and I was like, no, nevermind.
[56:17.18]I actually don't fucking know.
[56:19.58]I think it was Henry.
[56:20.44]I think it was, yeah, it was Henry.
[56:21.98]Henry the, it was Henry the fucking seven.
[56:23.62]Well, a choice has to be made, so we're going to say D.
[56:28.66]That's fucked up lore.
[56:29.82]Which of these is the title of a 2011 hit single by Lady Gaga?
[56:36.58]It's born this way.
[56:52.39]Lady, what are you talking about?
[56:53.69]I believe it's D, but I'll pick A. Complete the title of a 2002 film, My Big Fat Greek Wedding.
[56:59.61]But didn't they make a couple of movies?
[57:19.68]My Big Fat Greek Boyfriend?
[57:21.20]No, my big... There was two or three movies, wasn't there?
[57:23.62]Is this a trick question?
[57:27.14]Okay, no, they did a couple of them, didn't they?
[57:31.62]According to the title of a 1988 film comedy, Earth Girls are what?
[57:47.02]That would be... That'd be Earth.
[57:50.28]That'd be easy.
[57:51.50]Why do you talk in third person?
[57:56.44]Do I?
[57:56.98]No, I don't.
[58:08.21]Why did I know that?
[58:09.97]Look up who is in that movie and ask me why I would know the answer to that question very quickly.
[58:17.17]Look up who stars in that movie and then ask me why I would know that.
[58:19.99]Go ahead.
[58:23.12]What is the name of Miami's NBA team?
[58:25.06]Miami Heat.
[58:26.80]Exactly.
[58:37.02]Hey, that question almost drove me crazy.
[58:41.92]Yeah, Jim Carrey.
[58:44.80]You will be asked a new question now.
[58:48.24]The U.S.
[58:48.54]city of Minneapolis stands on which river?
[58:50.93]Uh-oh.
[58:56.25]Oh, God.
[58:59.97]I know, I'm right there with you.
[59:02.23]Ohio, Missouri, I don't know.
[59:09.27]This could be like a weird trick question here.
[59:11.09]That makes sense.
[59:21.28]It doesn't.
[59:27.43]Well, the old nanny gold is up to her old tricks.
[59:30.84]I don't know because I read it in chat.
[59:32.78]You're guaranteed cash prize.
[59:34.86]You played a good game.
[59:36.26]Good try.
[59:38.58]Stop.
[59:45.01]This is hard.
[59:47.13]You know why?
[59:47.69]Okay, listen.
[59:49.53]I know there's some trivia buffs here, but listen to me.
[59:53.41]Everybody has a handful of categories that they know everything about.
[59:57.21]And then they kind of don't know shit about any of the categories in life.
[60:00.67]You know what I'm saying?
[60:03.00]I know a shitload about very specific things.
[60:05.94]So trying to know everything about every category is impossible.
[60:11.38]That's why these shows make money.
[60:12.85]That's why nobody ever wins.
[60:13.99]That's why like 15 people have ever won this goddamn show.
[60:18.28]You could know a little bit about everything, but you never know everything about everything.
[60:22.02]You gotta know a few about one topic.
[60:24.52]Three topics.
[60:27.02]There are probably some people that have really big history buffs, but the second a science question comes up, you're just like, I don't have any idea.
[60:33.46]But you could literally name me precise dates of when very important things happened.
[60:46.59]I would get...
[60:48.38]I would probably, honest to God, I would probably get 100% of these correct.
[60:55.36]I would probably get a lot of these correct too.
[60:59.62]But once you start talking about lifestyle or literature, oh boy, I have absolutely no idea.
[61:07.11]I know a lot about food.
[61:09.57]I don't cook it, I don't make it, but I eat it.
[61:11.39]And I know a lot about it and I know what I like.
[61:14.79]I'd probably get most of these probably wrong actually.
[61:19.34]I would probably get a lot of these right.
[61:22.72]Entertainment.
[61:24.42]Turn them off.
[61:28.36]That's kind of cheating though, isn't it?
[61:35.15]I have 560 points.
[61:38.07]Oh my god, you definitely heard that.
[61:40.37]I need 1000 points to unlock food.
[61:47.58]I'm not playing uneasy.
[61:56.51]Put on emote only.
[61:57.81]Yeah, fine.
[61:58.29]Put it on.
[61:59.95]Put on emote only right now to prove that I can't cheat.
[62:04.56]Do it.
[62:13.46]Let's go.
[62:16.48]When something is quartered, it is divided into how many pieces?

[62:41.79]Everybody, we're going to retile the roof.

[62:46.77]Don't click it.
[62:48.43]How do I hit B?
[62:50.71]No, that's not my- No, it's not.
[62:52.17]No.
[62:52.93]It's not.
[62:54.21]No, it's not.
[62:54.99]Don't- I didn't hit it twice.
[62:57.13]I didn't hit it twice.
[62:58.39]I didn't hit it twice.
[63:00.75]I didn't- Why did it say final answer?
[63:02.81]I didn't hit it twice?
[63:04.47]Oh my fucking god damn it, dude.

[68:19.74]And if you get like 10 questions wrong, you go all the way, you get like fucking 50 bucks.

[120:53.42]Um...
[121:08.92]Which of these words describes an egg which has gone bad?
[121:14.17]Addled?
[121:15.05]Paddled?
[121:16.01]Rattled?
[121:16.81]Saddled?
[121:17.49]Addled?
[121:19.19]And I don't know, but I would just say it's a rotten fucking egg.
[121:23.97]Why would you ever say anything else?
[121:26.93]It's a rotten egg.
[121:29.13]It's a rotten egg.
[121:30.78]It's gone bad.
[121:31.56]The egg has gone bad.
[121:32.64]Just say the egg has gone bad.
[121:34.00]Oh, that egg is addled.
[121:34.78]Just say the egg's bad.
[121:36.28]The egg's bad.
[121:37.06]The word QPI relates to which type of children's toy?
[121:59.29]I mean, I just cheated.
[122:05.01]I don't care.
[122:05.69]I won't cheat for this one, I promise.
[122:09.41]The third novel in a trilogy by E.L.
[122:14.41]James is called Fifty Shades of Grey.
[122:25.59]50 Shades Dirtier, 50 Shades Naughtier, 50 Shades Feared, 50 Shades Freed.
[122:35.79]This was a trilogy?
[122:37.01]50 Shades was a trilogy.
[122:40.98]50 Shades Dirtier?
[122:45.04]I'm going to say probably like 50 Shades Naughtier.
[122:51.65]Because 50 Shades dirtier would sound weird.
[122:54.42]50 Shades naughtier.
[122:57.18]I didn't know this was a trilogy.
[122:59.40]50 Shades freed?
[123:01.36]Why do so many of you guys know that?
[123:19.28]You're never gonna make it past 1,000.
[123:20.80]I made it past 1,000 an hour ago.
[123:23.66]Alright, this is actually the last one.
[123:25.19]No fucking help.
[123:25.85]Turn the chat off.
[123:26.53]I don't even care.
[123:29.13]I'm gonna try as hard as I can.
[123:30.19]I'm gonna go deep into the fucking brain here.
[123:31.79]And I'm gonna get every answer, most of them correct.
[123:35.25]Actual final one.
[123:36.33]Don't care.
[123:36.79]I'm not looking over here.
[123:37.73]E-mode only.
[123:38.25]Make it E-mode only.
[123:40.27]I'm just focusing.
[123:41.02]I'm gonna try as hard as I can.
[123:43.00]I'm gonna pretend like no one else is here.
[123:49.63]Fifty Shades Freed.
[123:50.79]Let's go for a whole new question.
[123:53.93]Action film.
[123:55.10]That's Cliffhanger.
[123:56.06]I would say B. I have no doubt.
[123:58.84]It's not a book, and it's an old movie.
[124:00.46]I know the answer.
[124:01.46]You got it.
[124:03.56]Our team of editors... Poker, what name is given to a hand?
[124:06.88]Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.
[124:09.16]The same suit.
[124:09.62]It's a royal flush.
[124:11.58]I would say D, obviously.
[124:13.52]You really know your answers.
[124:18.30]I'm not looking over her.
[124:22.60]In the fairy tale, which trio built houses of straw, sticks, and bricks?
[124:26.70]That would be the three... Not the three Billy goats.
[124:30.76]The three little pigs.
[124:31.30]Where did the Wright brothers make their first powered flight?
[124:47.53]Kitty Moth, Kitty Cove, Kitty Hawk, Kitty Cat.
[124:52.77]God, Kitty Cove.
[124:55.05]All the rest of these sound weird.
[124:58.87]Kitty Cove.
[125:01.85]Not Kitty Cat, not Kitty Hawk.
[125:03.79]It's Kitty Cove.
[125:04.77]I fucking hate this.
[125:11.47]I don't know fucking trivia.
[125:13.53]Who cares?
[125:14.01]Does it really matter?
[125:15.53]Does that actually matter that I don't know?
[125:20.98]You know what would probably help?
[125:23.03]Instead of autoplaying ASMR eating videos and log cutting videos, maybe I should just keep autoplay on like fucking American history and like European history and shit.
[125:34.89]That's probably the problem is.
[125:38.43]Maybe I should have like documentaries playing rather than like people eating snacks loud.
[125:43.44]Playing in my head all night.
[125:46.53]Actually, last one.
[125:47.25]I promise, everybody.
[125:48.19]I actually promise.
[125:48.95]It's fine, no matter what happens.
[125:50.61]I'd have to get past fucking a thousand bucks.
[125:52.37]Come on.
[125:53.95]I just keep second-guessing myself.
[125:56.74]I swear to God, this is it.
[126:11.26]This is embarrassing for me.
[126:12.38]This is embarrassing.
[126:13.10]I'd rather be naked on stream than do this.
[126:15.99]Because I would rather be naked on camera.
[126:20.11]Look at how embarrassing this is.
[126:21.21]I'm sitting here doing trivia questions in front of you guys.
[126:25.18]This is hard.
[126:25.82]This is kind of embarrassing and hard for me.
[126:28.80]Okay.
[126:29.22]Which of these is a process that might result in the removal of its impeachment?
[126:32.54]Well, I'm going to try B. Yes, you are right.
[126:39.30]That just goes to show that my... Okay, this is the last one.
[126:43.80]What was the nickname of the American showman William Frederick Cody?
[126:49.43]Bumblebee Brian?
[126:57.71]No, it's... Isn't that... Wait, no, that's not right.
[127:01.17]That's right, I think.
[127:04.79]Yeah, okay.
[127:06.83]Let's go for this new eliminatory question.
[127:09.31]Which of these is traditionally baked in America?
[127:14.25]Apple pie.
[127:22.74]Shoofly pie?
[127:23.92]That's... Begone bug cake.
[127:25.60]It's time to...
[127:33.81]Excluding Jokers, how many playing cards are there in each suit of a standard pack?
[127:40.98]Exclude the Joker.
[127:41.60]How many there is?
[127:44.56]It's four of each suit.
[127:46.22]4, 8, 12, 16.
[127:48.22]Wait, I'm misreading the question.
[127:54.61]What?
[127:54.81]They're 12.
[127:55.43]No, 4, 8, 12, 16.
[127:55.99]How many suits are there?
[128:02.20]12?
[128:02.26]No.
[128:02.66]I'm reading the question fucking wrong.
[128:05.16]I'm reading the question wrong.
[128:06.76]I've read the question wrong.
[128:08.66]I'm reading the question wrong.
[128:09.36]Too much pressure and too much fucking bullshit.
[128:10.66]Too much in my head.
[128:12.34]There are four cards of each suit.
[128:16.19]There's four?
[128:18.31]It's 16?
[128:18.91]I'm reading the question wrong.
[128:23.93]What the fuck were they asking me?
[128:30.56]There's a Jack of...
[128:35.83]fucking music out of my head.
[128:37.15]Alright.
[128:38.57]I guarantee I'm going to get these questions right.
[128:40.27]Guaranteed.
[128:40.75]Turn the music off and I'll get it right.
[128:47.10]No more fucking loud musical sound effects.
[128:50.32]I can concentrate now.
[128:56.06]I thought it was asking me how many suits.
[129:00.63]Watch this.
[129:03.26]Watch this without, like, plastic shit in my ears.
[129:06.42]Here we go.

[129:15.12]Easy.
[129:18.14]It's K2.
[129:20.30]According to the title of a Strauss waltz, what color is the Danube?
[129:42.51]Is it green?
[129:43.75]I'm going to pick A. But what the fuck is that?
[129:51.20]What?
[129:51.40]That's not even general knowledge.
[129:55.14]This is not general.
[129:56.04]That's very specific fucking knowledge.
[129:58.18]That's very specific.
[130:15.06]Fucking trivia.
[130:17.43]Who gives a shit?
[130:20.89]Watch me in Wheel of Fortune.
[130:24.13]I'll see you at Wheel of Fortune.

[130:56.67]Tin.
[130:57.93]Copper.
[130:59.70]Helium.
[131:01.66]Getting this wrong would... I would be concerned.
[131:03.66]Okay.
[131:04.58]I haven't spent... I would say D, obviously.
[131:09.20]That's enough.
[131:10.56]Ah, chill.
[131:10.90]Let's go for this new eliminatory question.
[131:12.36]What's the name for the hard skin at the base of the fingernail?
[131:15.79]The, uh... The cuticle.
[131:21.45]It's D, I think.
[131:22.85]I'm choosing D.
[131:25.59]There's so many things to know.
[131:31.11]There's so many things to know.
[131:34.71]There are a million things to know.
[131:41.02]What day is celebrated each year in the U.S.
[131:42.70]on June 14th?
[132:07.59]Flag day?

[132:10.51]It's flag day.
[132:11.37]Which US city is known as the Big Easy?
[132:14.33]That would be... I think that's New Orleans.
[132:20.09]The Big Easy.
[132:22.28]That's New Orleans.
[132:38.77]That's New Orleans.
[132:41.99]I would say B. I have no doubt.
[132:44.04]We're good.
[132:48.38]Which Ivy League university is located in Providence, Rhode Island?
[132:52.26]Brown.
[132:53.26]No.
[132:55.26]Yale is Connecticut.
[132:58.58]Shit.
[133:02.84]It's Brown.
[133:03.69]It has to.
[133:03.99]Yeah.
[133:04.41]Yale is Connecticut.
[133:05.67]Columbia is... Brown's in Providence.
[133:10.20]Let's fucking go.
[133:15.91]See, I know shit.
[133:17.03]I just don't know specific other shit.
[133:19.63]What shape?
[133:22.73]What shape is the room in the White House used as the American president's private office?
[133:25.75]That's the Oval Office.
[133:27.86]See, I know things.
[133:29.28]Look, I just don't know every other thing.
[133:33.96]That's the one.
[133:38.16]If you dislocated a metacarpal, which part of your body would be the most affected?
[133:44.10]Your hand.
[133:45.42]Metacarpal would be like up here.
[133:47.98]That's your hand.
[133:51.68]Wait.
[133:52.78]But that, no.
[133:53.86]That's hand.
[133:54.66]But could it be elbow?
[133:56.84]I think it's hand.
[133:58.62]That makes the most logical sense to me.
[134:00.50]I don't need to use a lifeline for that.
[134:01.56]It has to be metacarpal.
[134:02.84]It has to be hand.
[134:04.44]Yes, absolutely.
[134:07.92]Look at this, and without music or without sounds in my ear, I can do this.
[134:10.64]Let's go.
[134:10.90]How many letters are there in a Tetragrammaton?
[134:12.12]Okay.
[134:12.22]A Tetragrammaton.
[134:14.31]I don't know.
[134:37.58]It's now up to the audience to choose what they think is the right answer.
[134:41.85]Good luck.
[134:46.05]4 or 40?
[134:49.39]I mean, Tetra sounds like 4, but, like, Grammaton sounds like a lot.
[134:54.93]Like a Tetragrammaton.
[134:56.18]That sounds like a big number.
[134:59.26]But I'm going to go with the audience.
[135:00.32]I can say D, obviously.
[135:03.58]That's it.
[135:04.36]I can get behind.
[135:08.41]Come on.
[135:09.67]I hope you have recovered from your emotions because here is your new question.
[135:13.59]The name of which of these colors means seawater?
[135:18.17]Aquamarine or turquoise?
[135:22.92]Aquamarine.
[135:24.22]Aquamarine.
[135:25.24]To me, these are the same color in my head.
[135:28.76]It's aquamarine.
[135:31.32]Turquoise is a little more blue.
[135:32.34]Aquamarine is more green.
[135:34.14]But turquoise is seawater.
[135:39.83]Turquoise is blue.
[135:41.27]Aquamarine's kind of green.
[135:42.77]I think it's turquoise.
[135:43.95]I'm going with turquoise.
[135:45.09]I'm going with turquoise.
[135:45.95]I'm going with turquoise.
[135:46.69]I'm going to click on turquoise right now.
[135:47.91]And then three, two, one.
[135:51.94]It's Aquamarine.

[135:52.50]32,000.

[140:45.89]I would say a giant.
[140:48.99]Is it a giant?
[140:51.82]I would click giant.
[140:53.72]If it was going to be giant.
[140:55.72]I'm doing giant, I think.
[140:57.54]Fuck it, whatever.

[141:19.38]I had it right.
[141:20.14]Alright, I'm moving on.
[141:21.60]I'm playing a different game.
[141:22.84]Trivia... Whatever.
[141:24.26]I don't care about trivia.
[141:25.60]Who cares?
[141:32.10]I don't care about... Oh, no.
[141:33.84]I don't know trivia questions.
[141:35.50]Who cares?
[141:38.83]Okay.
[141:39.41]Wheel of Fortune or Family Feud?
[141:40.57]Let's do Wheel of Fortune first.
[141:43.09]That sounds better.
[141:46.05]Can one of the mods switch to Wheel of Fortune?
[141:50.84]And you can take it off emote-only mode.
[141:53.12]They can't give me answers for this anyways, I don't think.
[141:54.60]Is this an Ubisoft game?
[142:08.54]Interesting.
[142:09.56]Okay, so how do I... Wheel of Fortune, coming up.
[142:22.77]Oh, you need to pee?
[142:25.77]What is it doing?

[142:37.78]There he is!
[142:38.60]Sam the Eagle!
[142:54.00]I know how to play Wheel of Fortune.
[142:59.66]Okay.
[143:00.38]So... I don't want to play online with people.
[143:02.76]They're gonna make me look like shit.
[143:15.61]One controller.
[143:17.49]Classic.
[143:18.95]I need to... Let me get in the swing of things first.
[143:25.32]I need to get into the swing of things first.
[143:27.68]Because what if I get this so fucking wrong?
[143:30.06]I'll do online in a minute.
[143:42.00]Why would you lock every hairstyle?
[143:47.56]Every single hairstyle is locked except for the default one.
[144:02.62]There's only one pair of pants.
[144:15.63]Okay.
[144:17.69]I think that works.
[144:19.65]Let me just familiarize myself with the game.
[144:24.55]I need to familiarize myself with the game.
[144:30.81]There's only two choices.
[144:35.11]Here we go.
[144:35.93]5 FPS.

[248:11.13]Why am I only one person?
[248:13.97]Our families will be battling it out to answer your surveys.
[248:16.96]Whoever scores the most points goes on to fast money for the chance to win a lot of cash and a brand new car.
[248:28.42]Why do I have no family here?
[248:30.60]The person that asked the question, can you play Family Feud without a family?
[248:34.38]The answer is yes.
[248:35.58]Alright, let's go.
[248:36.48]That run was really weird.
[248:38.73]Okay.
[248:56.33]I'm gonna ask you a question, and you need to buzz in first to answer.
[249:00.64]If you can find what's hiding behind the top slot, you get to choose if your family plays the round or gives it a pass.
[249:07.82]100 people.
[249:08.54]We ask them the following.
[249:11.22]Name something you buy that you hope you never have to use.
[249:14.88]A toothbrush.
[249:17.29]Um... Um... I don't know.
[249:20.69]I don't know.
[249:21.09]What is something you buy?
[249:22.89]A, um...
[249:25.13]I don't know.
[249:27.65]A coffin?
[249:28.73]A gun?
[249:32.85]Yeah, I don't know.
[249:34.49]A coffin?
[249:34.99]A gun?
[249:35.33]Makes sense.
[249:35.83]Maybe.
[249:36.03]A coffin?
[249:36.41]I do that.
[249:39.21]I go...
[249:57.80]I'm going to pass this because I don't know.
[250:00.84]What do you got?
[250:06.32]Something that you don't want to use.
[250:07.48]A fucking suppository?
[250:08.52]Why does he say suppository?
[250:24.05]No, you want to use a suppository if it's medical, if it's medicated.
[250:27.67]You want to use a suppository if it's prescribed?
[250:30.91]What are you talking about?
[250:40.66]Okay.
[250:42.64]Does this guy just say everything right?
[250:44.59]You've got another strike on the board.
[250:49.08]Okay, what else?
[250:49.88]You got anything else?
[250:50.46]I need to think of something to steal.
[250:52.12]Like you shit your pants.
[250:53.62]These are all such fucking dog shit answers.
[251:13.02]That's such a fucking bad answer.
[251:15.61]That's such a bad answer.
[251:17.81]Okay, what do I never want to use besides that gun?
[251:20.15]How about... Something you buy that you don't ever want to use.
[252:03.31]A knife.
[252:04.19]No, you cook with that.
[252:09.29]Bug spray.
[252:11.23]Like, roach killer.
[252:13.03]Roach spray.
[252:15.02]Bug spray.
[252:16.32]Poison to kill bugs.
[252:27.94]It's worth a shot.
[252:30.36]Let's run with it.
[252:37.82]I'm very curious about what these answers are.
[252:42.63]Holy shit, man.
[252:43.33]What is it?
[252:43.87]What's going on?
[252:59.69]Insurance.

[253:01.73]Let's see what's behind number three.
[253:06.03]Casket.
[253:06.69]Oh, it was casket.
[253:07.73]I would have got it.
[253:08.37]What's hiding behind slot number two?
[253:12.48]Fire extinguisher.
[253:13.48]Yeah, whatever.
[253:16.82]Here's how the scores are shaping up so far.
[253:18.98]What's going on with his voice?
[253:20.04]His voice is changing pitch.
[253:21.88]Here's how the scores are shaping up so far.
[253:24.95]What the fuck was that?
[253:25.65]Let's see what awaits us next.
[253:27.55]Wow.

[257:25.50]Eight answers are up there.
[257:27.92]Interested in doubling your money?
[257:29.54]Because now everything is worth twice as much.
[257:33.78]In our survey, we asked 100 people, name a U.S.
[257:38.42]soap opera.
[257:39.18]I don't fucking know any.
[257:45.22]You're up first.
[257:46.06]What do you got?
[257:48.36]That's not a soap opera.
[257:49.72]That's not a soap opera.

[258:46.90]Somebody said he doesn't even want to play the game.
[258:51.11]He's not even playing the game.
[259:07.22]Give me an answer.
[259:08.28]But it works a lot of times.
[259:11.82]One life to live.
[259:12.78]Feeling lucky?
[259:14.44]No, that's not a soap opera.

[259:46.97]I thought it was raining.
[259:48.23]I thought it was actually raining.
[259:49.61]But that's just a weird clapping sound.
[259:55.03]Alright.
[259:55.65]Let's try it.
[259:57.67]Could it be there?
[260:00.97]General Hospital.
[260:01.63]MASH is not a soap opera.
[260:03.29]That's tough.
[260:05.35]Whoop.
[260:08.47]What do you have for us?
[260:09.43]Oh, settle down.
[260:10.37]What's with this, like, end zone celebrations?
[260:14.41]Interesting answer.
[260:16.95]Did anyone in the survey say this?

[260:41.11]Oh, shut up.
[260:44.04]Bold and the Beautiful.

[260:47.22]As the World Turns.
[260:48.20]Bold and the Beautiful is way more popular.
[261:04.79]Way more popular.
[261:05.61]Thank you.
[261:05.83]Alright.
[261:06.07]Bold and the Beautiful is probably... Bold and the Beautiful.
[261:09.65]Not Family Guy.
[261:10.08]Stop it.
[261:10.82]Okay.
[261:10.92]Bold and the Beautiful.
[261:11.66]All My Children?
[261:35.31]I think it's Bold and Beautiful.
[261:40.39]I just have to get one.
[261:44.52]Bold and Beautiful.
[261:46.06]But is that... That's it, right?
[261:47.72]I'm in the game.
[262:03.96]You really needed those points.
[262:07.04]I'm in the game.
[262:07.44]It's time to take a look at what we didn't find.
[262:11.05]Time for five.
[262:12.45]All My Children.
[262:14.19]Passions.
[262:16.27]Answer number three.
[262:19.76]All My Children.
[262:20.48]It would have been right.
[262:21.28]You would have had it.
[262:24.14]Let's take a look at the current scores.
[262:26.24]I'm in the game still.
[262:28.13]One more good round and I get it.
[262:29.17]This game is shaping up to be a real thriller.
[262:31.69]I got to piss so bad.
[262:32.31]I can't wait to see who comes out on top.
[262:40.94]I'm so sad.
[262:46.60]Are you ready for another face-off?
[262:48.24]The game is close.
[262:48.94]Why am I so depressed?
[262:49.92]I need a contestant from each family, please.
[262:59.76]Alright, this is actually important.
[263:00.99]Let's go.
[263:04.05]Boat?
[263:29.77]Both.
[263:31.39]Treasure.
[263:34.01]A treasure.
[263:34.39]You bring treasure.
[263:38.56]What?
[263:38.70]What else would you bring?
[263:41.02]Treasure.
[264:00.20]You would not bring a... Okay.
[264:01.74]Well, I don't know if I want to go on a date with that sword.
[264:04.46]Bring the sword to the date.
[264:05.48]Excuse me?
[264:05.80]What are you talking about?
[264:07.82]I said treasure because... Let's hope someone in your family has the top answer.
[264:10.80]Let's play.
[264:28.40]Let's watch again.
[264:29.21]Watch Andy.
[264:29.97]It's your go.
[264:30.93]What do you think?
[264:36.39]Here we go then.
[264:38.13]Jolly Roger.
[264:39.05]Survey said Jolly Roger.
[264:45.52]If it's not on the board, you get a strike.
[264:48.00]You're going to bring the Jolly Roger.
[264:52.32]Alright.
[264:52.90]Let's hear it.
[264:57.11]A parrot.
[264:57.65]Yeah, okay.
[264:59.33]I need to steal because this is important.
[265:02.09]The parrot's not on there.
[265:06.77]No, it's not.
[265:07.31]Holy shit.
[265:07.67]What's number one?
[265:08.27]Gold?
[265:08.79]Gold?
[265:09.15]That's going to be number one.
[265:28.23]If it's not number one, then I don't know what is.
[265:30.13]What is number one?
[265:31.05]It has to be gold.
[265:32.59]Gold.
[265:33.63]Gold.
[265:33.95]It's gold.
[265:34.32]It's gold.
[265:34.78]I got it.
[265:35.14]It's gold.
[265:35.46]It's gold.
[265:35.78]It's gold.
[265:36.02]It's gold.
[265:36.28]It's gold.
[265:36.56]Gold.

[265:36.86]Gold.
[265:37.00]Gold.
[265:37.10]Gold.
[265:37.20]Alcohol.
[265:37.46]Yep.
[265:37.82]You bring the ship to the date.
[265:41.70]You're going to bring the ship to the date.
[265:50.09]How would that work?
[265:50.87]Uh, and how would that work?
[265:53.63]Yeah, let's go to the Applebee's.
[265:55.09]I'm going to show up in my fucking sailing boat.
[265:56.89]What are you... What?
[265:57.43]Where are you... How?
[265:58.13]No, it's going to be gold.
[265:59.59]Peg legs!
[266:15.96]Gold.
[266:17.84]It's going to be gold and I win.
[266:20.26]It's going to be gold and I win.
[266:22.38]Gold.
[266:22.72]Gold or alcohol.
[266:24.00]Rum.
[266:26.56]Would I bring my own booze into the restaurant though?
[266:31.47]I don't know.
[266:31.87]Would I actually bring my own booze to the restaurant?
[266:37.41]Gold or rum.
[266:38.51]Which one's better?
[266:41.21]It's gonna be rum.
[266:46.35]Nope, it's not.
[266:48.31]What is it then?
[266:50.99]Gold?
[266:53.99]It's gotta be gold, right?
[266:57.10]Or eye patch?
[266:58.16]No, peg leg wasn't on there.
[266:59.96]Why would eye patch be?
[267:01.36]It's gold.
[267:04.16]Okay.
[267:05.98]Survey says... Gold.
[267:12.17]That's not what we're looking for.
[267:17.41]Fuck your whole family.
[267:19.15]Congrats, this round is yours.
[267:22.27]Now it's time to see what you missed.
[267:25.70]Number four, show yourself.
[267:29.54]Car.
[267:31.38]Show me the third answer.
[267:35.00]Eyepatch.
[267:39.02]And now it's time for one last look at the scores.
[267:44.69]And that's it.
[267:45.79]We have ourselves a winner.
[267:47.23]You'd bring a car, dude.
[267:48.53]Of course you would.
[267:49.81]Because you'd be a guy dressed in a pirate costume.
[267:52.05]You'd be a girl dressed in a pirate costume.
[267:54.83]But it's time to say goodbye.
[267:56.19]Why would a car?
[268:01.91]Looks like we won't be seeing you playing fast money today.
[268:06.38]You may have missed a shot at the jackpot, but you've still got some points from the previous round.
[268:10.44]And we can turn into a nice stash of cash.
[268:21.09]We'll see you next time, folks, on The Fuse.
[268:32.14]Good night.
[268:32.60]Want to give it another go?
[268:49.69]Alright, let's do this again.
[268:54.24]Let's make Sunday a fun day.
[268:56.70]Come on, let's play Family Feud.
[269:08.07]I'm not going anywhere.
[269:09.55]Lucky is here to stay.
[269:15.37]Let's give a big, hey, haven't we met before?
[269:18.80]To our returning family.
[269:20.04]This guy's got me energy.
[269:21.98]I'm feeding off of this guy.
[269:23.84]I'm feeding off of this guy.
[269:27.34]With their eyes on first.
[269:30.26]And defending their crown.
[269:35.06]I feel like me and this guy would get along.
[269:36.92]Here's a quick rundown on the rules.
[269:39.06]I'll ask you a survey.
[269:41.47]No, I don't.
[269:41.91]Fuck the Ubisoft club.
[269:43.91]I want to play Family Feud on the Switch.
[269:46.80]I don't want to go through a fucking hoop to get there.
[269:50.94]I want to play the video game without any other extra fucking steps.
[269:56.59]Without any extra steps.
[269:58.31]There's extra steps everywhere.
[270:00.47]I just want to... I've got to relax.
[270:03.09]My blood pressure, right?
[270:04.01]I don't want to go too long.
[270:12.62]I'm taking this.
[270:14.81]I'm going fast money.
[270:15.53]Let's go.
[270:15.75]Let's go.
[270:16.05]Can.
[270:42.57]A door.
[270:42.75]That's a good answer.
[270:48.69]Ah, yes.

[274:25.23]Let's check the board.
[274:26.93]I don't think... That's not accurate.
[274:28.45]What?
[274:29.07]You open your mail every single day?
[274:35.75]I don't think so, but I got it.
[274:39.72]Which family is leading the way?
[274:41.92]It wasn't email.
[274:42.56]That was regular mail.
[274:45.16]That's only the first round.
[274:46.70]Let's keep moving.
[274:51.38]None of us have responsibilities.
[274:53.10]What do you think I have responsibilities?
[274:57.35]What are you going to get in the mail that you need that you can't get on your fucking phone or on a website?
[275:02.79]What responsibilities are you going to do through the mail in 2022?
[275:06.64]I'm very curious.
[275:10.56]That you do every single day in the mail.
[275:16.36]You know what I get in the mail?
[275:17.24]A bunch of fucking advertisements that I have to shred.
[275:19.28]I get advertisements.
[275:20.16]Alright, what?
[275:20.72]I don't know.
[275:21.14]What?
[275:41.22]Let's see if you're right.
[275:42.66]Who is doing this?
[275:44.06]Honey.
[275:44.80]Who puts honey all over their body?
[275:46.28]Why would you do that?
[275:48.08]Not in this survey.
[275:49.04]Okay, lotion?
[275:50.56]Let's hope we haven't run out of ideas yet.
[275:54.18]You put honey all over you.
[275:57.28]I would say lotion.
[276:01.85]Right?
[276:03.05]That's what you're going with?
[276:06.13]Do we have a right answer?
[276:07.33]Lotion.
[276:12.60]We've got a top answer.
[276:14.60]I ain't playing this.
[276:15.34]So what do you say?
[276:16.38]I'm passing it.
[276:16.88]Pass or play?
[276:20.28]There's no way the AI's gonna get this.
[276:26.95]You're up.
[276:27.63]What you got for me?
[276:33.01]Tattoo.
[276:33.35]We have an answer.
[276:35.69]Did our survey say it?
[276:38.38]Tattoo.
[276:40.60]Nope.
[276:42.39]You failed to find an answer.
[276:43.69]Water is a pretty good one.
[276:44.53]Which means you get your first strike of the round.
[276:50.96]Do you have an answer?
[276:51.74]I am playing the game.
[276:52.52]This is tactical strategy bullshit.
[276:56.86]That's your answer.
[276:57.62]They're not going to get it.
[276:58.47]Show me that answer.
[276:59.99]The first person said honey, guys.
[277:01.61]They're not going to get it.
[277:05.55]It's up there.
[277:10.94]Name something people put all over their bodies.
[277:18.07]Got it.
[277:20.17]All over your body?
[277:22.29]Perfume?
[277:22.89]No, no way.
[277:25.01]No fucking way, dude.
[277:26.95]No way.
[277:28.83]You put perfume all over your entire body?
[277:31.23]Moving along the feud chain.
[277:37.50]Okay, sure.
[277:39.78]Is it there?
[277:42.42]Tattoo wasn't up there.
[277:49.45]Piercings aren't going to be either.
[277:50.99]Alright, I gotta think, I gotta think, I gotta think.
[277:57.15]What goes up here?
[278:10.71]Oh god, I'm sorry.
[278:11.39]Alright, what do we got?
[278:12.04]What, sunscreen, water?
[278:13.10]Sunscreen.
[278:15.94]Sunscreen's gonna be good.
[278:17.10]Sunscreen, sunscreen, sunscreen, sunscreen, sunscreen.
[278:19.84]Sunscreen.
[278:20.44]Perfect.
[278:41.46]Sunscreen is lotion, but I don't know.
[278:43.56]Water would be the only other one that I could think of that would be the real one.
[278:46.30]That was really fast.
[278:48.38]Uh, water.
[278:49.76]Sunscreen.
[278:50.54]But water is so stupidly easy.
[278:52.32]I feel like it has to be up there.
[278:53.36]Do you have, like, huge neck veins?
[278:55.88]This is... This is not what that is.
[278:58.35]Look.
[279:00.69]Um... I'm gonna say water.
[279:02.31]Okay.
[279:06.69]Water.
[279:07.59]Water.
[279:09.83]Is it up there?
[279:10.79]Show me.
[279:12.73]Water.
[279:14.99]Oh, come on.
[279:16.58]That's not the one.
[279:22.80]You're narrowing the gap.
[279:25.68]That was such an easy answer, too.
[279:27.32]What was it?
[279:30.06]What's the fourth answer?
[279:33.68]Powder.
[279:34.58]Nobody does that.
[279:35.18]Who puts powder all over their whole body?
[279:36.88]Sounds like me and divorce cards.
[279:41.48]Nobody does that.
[279:42.56]Oil all over your body?
[279:44.12]Powder all over your whole body?
[279:45.50]Are you a gymnast?
[279:46.10]Who's putting powder all over their body?
[280:06.26]Get your game faces on because it's time for the face-off.
[280:10.64]Who wants to play?
[280:11.76]Get over here.
[280:12.28]I'm still winning.
[280:14.14]I'm still winning.
[280:14.62]I'm fine.
[280:24.35]Yeah, baby powder.
[280:25.67]I put baby powder on my balls.
[280:27.33]Okay, yeah.
[280:29.22]Going like this on your balls with powder, by the way, is not going like this.
[280:32.96]Everywhere else.
[280:36.66]It didn't say, what do you put on your balls?
[280:38.64]Something that smells good.
[280:39.88]Bacon.
[280:40.90]You have an answer?
[280:41.62]Good answer.
[280:49.54]Feeling lucky?
[280:51.86]Let's see it.
[280:54.14]Bacon.
[280:57.62]That's worth the most points.
[281:00.52]What's it going to be?
[281:01.56]Play or pass?
[281:05.32]Oh, this time around they want to play.
[281:07.80]Okay.
[281:09.78]Food.
[281:10.10]I think all food is included in that, right?
[281:14.61]So you can't say any more foods.
[281:16.77]What smells good?
[281:19.35]Candle?
[281:20.41]I mean, a candle makes sense to me.
[281:21.83]A candle.
[281:22.31]Got it.
[281:22.71]Perfume.
[281:23.09]Let's see if it's there.
[281:24.02]Candle.
[281:38.10]Candles smell great.
[281:38.84]Okay.
[281:39.06]Perfume.
[281:39.80]Nature.
[281:40.16]Flowers.
[281:40.42]Flowers.
[281:40.70]Yeah, I'll do flowers.
[281:44.52]Flowers smells good.
[281:45.53]Here it is.
[281:45.95]Alright.
[281:46.27]These next- They're gonna be so specific.
[282:07.60]That's almost 80% of every single answer.
[282:11.80]What is a specific thing that smells good?
[282:25.23]If I say a drink, does that include... I'll say perfume, but I think... I don't know if it's going to be up there.
[282:33.17]Cologne, perfume, right?
[282:36.47]That was the other one I wanted to do.
[282:44.05]Cologne?
[282:44.65]Okay, yep.
[282:45.25]So then what's the other one?
[282:50.43]Soap?
[282:52.11]Okay, what about soap?
[282:54.97]I think soap could be it, probably.
[282:57.95]Coffee, but I think coffee is going to be food.
[283:00.95]Soap.
[283:04.33]Soap smells good.
[283:05.03]Fresh cookies.
[283:05.65]Somebody said fresh cookies.
[283:06.73]Alright, alright.
[283:07.29]Coffee.
[283:07.57]I'm gonna say coffee.
[283:38.55]Coffee.
[283:40.43]Good.
[283:41.01]Okay.
[283:42.65]Our survey says coffee.
[283:48.16]So what is it?
[283:49.06]That's three.
[283:51.30]This round is getting thrown over to the other side.
[283:53.74]They're going to say something stupid.
[283:58.60]If they can find just one answer, this family will steal the board.
[284:04.45]Here's your chance.
[284:05.37]You can do it.
[284:11.33]To me, that's candle.
[284:12.55]To me, if candle is not that, then that's annoying.
[284:16.79]Yeah, that's annoying.
[284:20.19]I was going to say candle and air freshener are both in the same category.
[284:26.07]I'm destroying them.
[284:27.14]So what is it?
[284:41.06]Before we start another round, let's find out who's on top.
[284:47.48]People.
[284:48.38]If somebody asked me, hey, what do you think smells good?
[284:53.66]Just give me the first thing that comes to your head.
[284:55.12]People.
[284:56.79]That doesn't make any sense.
[285:01.33]Nowhere near as painful as it sounds, it's the face-off.
[285:04.73]How would that possibly be the first thing that you say?
[285:09.55]How would that possibly be the first thing?
[285:13.17]I can't imagine a world where that is remotely physically possible.
[285:19.88]We're on the hunt for six answers.
[285:21.68]Bacon, perfume, flowers.
[285:23.36]Stakes are getting higher because we're now tripling the points.
[285:28.18]We got 100 people to answer the following question.
[285:32.47]Name someone in your life who usually does more talking than listening.
[285:38.27]You got in first.
[285:46.78]definitely it's like it's like it's my bad about it no we're gonna do mother-in-law I don't but I don't I don't have a mother-in-law but this is like the answer right this is like the answer what nada that's that's the answer oh my mother-in-law understood our survey says neighbor

[286:19.73]Good try.
[286:21.35]Do you have an answer for us?
[286:22.53]I don't.
[286:22.91]Okay.
[286:23.35]But I don't know.
[286:24.49]I don't know.
[286:29.23]The fucking dentist?
[286:32.68]The dentist keeps talking, right?
[286:34.38]Oh, nice.
[286:37.80]Here we go.
[286:38.34]The dentist never shuts up.
[286:40.20]Let's run with it.
[286:42.84]Dentist.
[286:47.54]We were going for number six.
[286:49.46]We weren't going for number one.
[286:51.20]I was going for number... Listen, I was going for number six.
[286:53.22]I wasn't going for number one.
[286:55.30]That was my other answer.
[286:56.39]We're not going to be able to do this.
[287:04.71]What happens?
[287:05.13]Okay, how about this?
[287:05.97]It's going to be...

[287:35.98]What am I...
[287:46.60]Okay, who else talks a lot?
[287:48.01]Okay, who talks a lot but doesn't really listen?
[287:50.67]They talk a lot.

[288:40.17]It's different.
[288:42.23]Okay, I'm going to say teacher, but I feel like that's kind of... A kid?
[288:44.26]A little kid?
[288:44.98]Yeah.
[288:45.10]That is a lot of talking.
[288:45.72]But doesn't really listen.

[289:14.31]Yeah, boss, boss, boss.
[289:15.21]That's a good one.
[289:20.35]Okay, that's weird.
[289:22.17]Doctor would be the other one I would think of.
[289:28.64]I would say doctor.
[289:35.90]Or politician.
[289:36.46]It's gotta be politician.
[289:39.92]It has to be.
[289:40.50]Or doctor.
[289:44.36]How is that not up there?
[289:46.96]What would be up there besides doctor?
[290:03.71]I did teach her already.
[290:04.75]What else would it be?
[290:05.67]Sibling?
[290:06.19]It's not going to be up there.
[290:07.97]It's not going to be up there.

[291:04.18]Here's what the scores look like after that round.
[291:06.00]I'm still in the lead.
[291:06.52]I think I won.
[291:07.62]Do I win?
[291:08.00]There's one more round.
[291:10.00]It ain't over yet.
[291:11.10]We need one more round to settle things.
[291:15.35]I do talk a lot, I do.
[291:20.57]The winning team needs to hit 300 points.
[291:23.31]It's time to decide this game.
[291:25.23]Alright, let's do it.
[291:25.75]Let's play Sudden Death.
[291:30.60]Someone from each family, get up here and play.
[291:42.67]so this is it we just want the number one answer for this survey we're asking for the top answer only points are tripled whoever gets this answer wins the round we've got answers from 100 people for this question okay

[292:05.59]Thank you for the victory.
[292:06.41]I appreciate it.
[292:12.00]Are you sure about that?
[292:14.76]Our survey said... It's not TV, because you can listen to music in every room.
[292:22.11]The TV is only in one spot.
[292:24.39]You've done it all by yourself, too.
[292:27.92]Alright, let's do Fast Money.
[292:29.26]Fast Money, and then we're gonna... I'm gonna go pee.
[292:36.88]And then we're gonna come back.
[292:38.34]And we're gonna play Deal or No Deal to the screen.
[292:41.92]Let's go.
[292:42.18]I have to answer them twice.
[292:54.66]So I don't have to go hide, but be put in like a different room.
[292:57.30]Okay.
[292:57.52]That's so stupid.
[292:58.24]Swim.

[303:48.69]So just be careful.
[303:53.12]Turn that off.
[303:55.88]Turn this filter off because I don't need to delay my camera anymore.

[304:19.09]This might be loud.
[304:19.73]I'm just saying.
[304:23.31]There's no audio at all.
[304:27.24]I don't hear anything either.
[304:31.94]Is there no audio?
[304:34.24]I thought there was.
[304:34.76]Okay.

[305:19.62]I'm going to pick number one.
[305:23.58]Is there no audio?
[305:26.70]Maybe there is no fucking audio.
[305:29.99]Yeah, there's supposed to be.
[305:34.09]Oh, there we go.
[305:35.95]Did it work?
[305:38.78]Can you hear it now?
[305:39.68]Alright, that's my case.

[305:47.08]Ow!
[306:15.14]Okay, I'm going to take four.
[306:19.76]Why is it doing this?
[306:22.26]Is it doing it for you too?
[306:25.64]It's so horrible sounding.
[306:27.03]Do you hear that?
[306:28.85]Is that just for me?
[306:30.47]It sounds like crunching, crackling audio.
[306:32.65]I don't know why.
[306:33.23]Alright, twelve.
[306:41.67]That's better.
[306:42.87]It's still wicked loud.
[306:45.31]Are you playing this on Newgrounds?
[306:51.33]Dude, this game only exists in two places.
[306:55.25]This game is just slot machines or random fucking flash games.
[307:00.12]This game does not exist anywhere else.
[307:04.34]Alright, we're going with 10.
[307:05.00]Alright, 5,000.
[307:08.97]That's not bad.

[308:13.86]750 still in play.
[308:17.52]By the way, who cares?
[308:18.58]There's no stakes in this at all.
[308:21.34]There are no stakes in what I'm doing.
[308:23.16]So who cares?
[308:23.78]Like, does it really matter?
[308:25.76]Why am I pretending that there's stakes?
[308:26.98]Alright, 1,000. 7.
[308:42.65]we need or no it's the same offer no no deal that's the spirit time for the next round nine oh shit 22. nice one alright not bad
[309:08.95]Oh, you guys have stakes.
[309:10.53]That's kind of cool.
[309:11.17]You guys get to have stakes.
[309:12.17]That's pretty awesome.
[309:12.81]20.
[309:13.97]Nice one.
[309:18.59]Will I win 250k or more?
[309:19.51]Excellent.
[309:19.97]Uh-oh.
[309:27.52]Alright.
[309:28.66]Deal or no deal?
[309:31.64]53k.
[309:31.88]I mean, the dollar is still in play.
[309:33.08]That's a no deal.
[309:34.04]No deal.
[309:34.80]That's the spirit.
[309:35.80]Time for the next round.
[309:39.59]11.
[309:39.61]Good.
[309:39.87]21.
[309:42.07]Good.
[309:42.25]26.
[309:42.29]Ah, this could be a good one.
[309:46.01]No deal.
[309:48.65]If I get rid of that 1 and that 25, then this is a GG.
[310:10.81]13.
[310:21.99]I'm going to wait until you guys bet.
[310:28.09]Okay.
[310:28.77]Now it's sealed.
[310:32.59]Oh, man.
[310:33.37]Congratulations.
[310:34.89]No deal.
[310:35.69]No deal.
[310:36.45]No deal.
[310:37.03]No deal.
[310:37.53]Time for the next round.
[310:41.98]25.
[310:42.08]Oh, boy.
[310:47.56]Okay, so there is a 1... 1 in 5 chance that I have the 750.
[310:57.07]But there's also a 1 in 5 chance that I have the 10,000 as well.
[311:01.67]You're not giving me a chance to fucking think?
[311:03.57]I'm just hanging the phone up.
[311:04.51]Alright, 18.
[311:08.20]Good.
[311:12.72]If I get rid of the 10k, that's big.
[311:18.82]Removing the 10k guarantees that the people that bet against me lose.
[311:23.23]So we're going to go for it 14.
[311:23.97]Uh-oh.
[311:26.53]There's a 1 in 3 chance that this is over 100,000.
[311:43.52]No deal.
[311:43.92]I'm keeping my case.
[311:45.49]Oh, fuck off!
[312:15.48]Why is it broken?
[312:26.94]Do you hear how fucking loud this is for me?
[312:34.69]Alright, again, let's do it again.
[312:37.09]Do it again.
[312:40.05]Will I win more than $250 in deal or no deal?
[313:02.22]I'm going to wait because I don't want to... I want you guys to be able to put your bets in before I do anything.
[313:10.46]The game's not a virus, dude.
[313:12.10]It's on MSN.
[313:14.32]It's on MSN.com.
[313:16.01]It's not a fucking virus.
[313:26.23]Okay, get your bets in because we're going to close it.
[313:30.07]Well, I can pick the case I want, right?
[313:33.30]Okay, the case I'm going to take is... 20.
[313:35.76]20.
[313:39.48]You should do stuff with the debt.
[313:52.81]I don't even know what the debt is at right now.
[313:54.35]That joke like sailed over me from like the last two years.
[313:58.36]Alright, how are we looking?
[313:59.48]We good?
[314:01.04]Can I start picking cases?
[314:06.76]My grandfather uses MSN.
[314:08.91]Yeah, I know.
[314:09.79]Alright, lock it in.
[314:17.35]Lock it in.
[314:24.09]Good luck to whoever's betting their channel points.
[314:32.05]And here we go.
[314:47.33]Alright.
[314:48.36]Good start.
[314:50.88]Let's give it a 1 this time because I picked it last time.
[314:54.12]Very good picks.
[314:55.14]Very, very good picks.
[314:56.32]26.
[314:56.90]Not very good, but alright.
[315:03.66]19.
[315:08.47]Oh my god, I owe like 150 community subs from like fucking 2 months ago.
[315:15.23]Oops.
[315:21.35]Oh, that's bad.
[315:22.15]That's really bad.
[315:23.57]Come on, dude.
[315:24.74]Oh, there's so much at stake!
[315:26.66]That was probably really loud.
[315:27.46]I'm really sorry.
[315:28.04]Was it loud?
[315:30.08]That was probably incredibly loud.
[315:31.16]Was that really loud?
[315:33.42]I'm really sorry.
[315:35.04]Three.
[315:58.57]There's still a chance there is.
[316:02.95]Just gotta get rid of a lot of these low numbers and that's it.
[316:04.79]Get rid of the one cent.
[316:07.71]Anybody else think that this show should have started at a thousand?
[316:15.17]Because if you're on a game show and you leave with a check for one cent...
[316:20.97]That kind of feels so rotten.
[316:23.31]That's just so evil.
[316:25.94]I think it should start at 1,000 and go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, then like 10, 12, 15, you know what I mean?
[316:30.32]Starting it at 1 cent, that feels fucking evil.
[316:35.20]Nice one.
[316:35.40]Deal or no deal.
[316:35.92]Or start at 25.
[316:49.02]Oh, very brave.
[316:50.48]Time for the next round.
[316:52.06]That's the point of the game.
[316:53.42]Yeah, but it's still, I mean, that's one cent.
[317:00.17]Nice one.
[317:01.29]That's not a nice one.
[317:02.31]That's bad because I need to get rid of these small numbers.
[317:04.25]I need to get one dollar.
[317:07.78]Excellent.
[317:08.50]Good.
[317:10.64]I'll take a crisp $25 bill right now.
[317:14.80]Oh, no, you take a crisp 25.
[317:16.12]That means a 20 and a 5.
[317:17.34]Okay.
[317:22.36]Good.
[317:23.60]All the doubters, I think you might be in some trouble.
[317:28.12]Oh, it's over.
[317:30.92]I'm so sorry.
[317:32.40]I'm sorry, everybody.
[317:35.74]It might not be over.
[317:37.02]If I have the 300k, then it's fine.
[317:53.38]Alright, hold on.
[317:54.10]It's alright.
[317:54.42]The 300k is in play still.
[317:54.92]This is still possible.
[317:56.32]Alright.
[317:56.84]No deal. 23.
[318:23.07]Okay.
[318:23.21]It's gonna be 300k or one cent.
[318:24.29]Oh my god.
[318:24.77]I mean, you almost kind of have to take this.
[318:26.85]Alright.
[318:27.33]Okay.
[318:47.54]No deal.
[318:48.28]No deal.
[318:49.06]That's the spirit.
[318:50.06]Time for the next round.
[318:51.34]This is it.
[318:53.19]It's either in my case or it's not.
[318:56.13]And if it's in my case, then the believers win.
[319:03.31]I'm sorry.
[319:03.69]I'm sorry.
[319:13.16]I had faith.
[319:13.70]I believed in my case.
[319:16.96]I'm sorry, guys.
[319:25.53]I'm sorry.
[319:28.29]Let's do it again.
[319:33.34]Let's do this one more time, and then I'm probably gonna go.
[319:42.11]Alright, I'm gonna pick...
[319:45.94]Let's go with two.
[319:49.36]Alright, get your bets in if you want to bet.
[319:50.62]Will I get over 250k?
[319:54.34]Which is actually, that's a hard bet.
[319:57.71]It's way more probable that I will get under 200k.
[320:01.77]That's a risk.
[320:16.91]Where's the gamble?
[320:17.45]It's going on right now.
[320:19.67]You got about 15 more seconds.
[320:24.75]Why do I feel like you've done this exact stream before?
[320:28.13]I've played a lot of the game show stuff, yeah.
[320:31.77]Some of the other versions.
[320:32.63]There's like 15 versions of all these games.
[320:36.42]Have I done Millionaire?
[320:37.52]I've done an old version of Millionaire, yeah.
[320:40.72]This is fun.
[320:41.78]Just chilling, playing these.
[320:43.40]I'm just stupid.
[320:44.84]Some of them are.
[320:46.81]It's fun.
[320:48.39]I come back to these game shows time to time.
[320:51.61]There's no gamble?
[320:52.55]Yes, there is.
[320:54.11]It says predict right now with channel points.
[320:56.55]I can see it.
[321:02.66]You played this exact one before.
[321:06.60]There's no betting?
[321:07.90]What?
[321:11.34]Oh, how come it says predict with channel points?
[321:15.28]Oh.
[321:17.03]How do I do it?
[321:19.67]Slash predict prediction.
[321:22.59]Okay.
[321:24.67]So slash prediction, start a prediction.
[321:30.14]Okay.
[321:30.48]Will I win $250 or more?
[321:37.32]Okay.
[321:37.60]Yes or no.
[321:38.80]And the submission panel is two minutes like that.
[321:48.22]Did I do it?
[321:51.28]Does it, did that work?
[321:58.71]Okay, cool.
[321:59.53]I got it.
[322:02.77]I got it.
[322:05.66]Two minutes is too long.
[322:06.74]I think I can just, I can shorten it.
[322:18.33]So do I have to press a button?
[322:21.17]I can end it early.
[322:22.13]Oh, do I have to hit the predict button?
[322:29.42]You guys are going all in?
[322:30.34]Uh-oh, be careful.
[322:34.90]Okay, you ready?
[322:36.49]I'm going for it in... 10 seconds.
[322:41.09]Here we go.
[322:41.57]Here we go.
[322:41.91]I'm going in.
[322:44.03]Predict.
[322:46.31]Did it work?
[322:50.56]Did I do it?
[322:57.23]Alright, here we go.
[322:58.67]No?
[322:58.85]Alright, well we gotta wait like 25 seconds.
[323:05.41]Don't let us down.
[323:05.97]This is the last one we're doing anyways.
[323:06.97]This is it.
[323:09.19]If you want to bet, this is the last time I'm doing this and I'm going to bed.
[323:11.98]What time is it?
[323:14.92]It's way too early to go to bed.
[323:18.36]30 seconds.
[323:18.68]If you want to bet, this is the final one.
[323:27.33]Swap at the end?
[323:27.99]I will make that decision at the end if I get there.
[323:32.39]Alright, this is it.
[323:34.61]Good luck.
[323:43.61]Three.
[323:44.89]Two.
[323:46.32]One.
[323:47.90]Here we go.
[323:52.10]Good start.
[323:59.07]Not great.
[323:59.49]26.
[324:01.79]That's alright.
[324:07.36]As long as these three stay, we're fine.
[324:08.98]12.
[324:12.76]What the fuck? 12.
[324:27.29]Alright, four.
[324:34.17]What the fuck, dude?
[324:35.65]Come on.
[324:39.99]This is getting bad.
[324:44.36]Statistically, these should stay for a while, though.
[324:46.58]Statistically speaking.
[324:49.36]Good.
[324:50.26]Good.
[325:00.07]Eighteen.
[325:02.33]It's okay.
[325:02.65]Ten.
[325:02.73]Good.
[325:03.59]Give her the one cent.
[325:04.97]Good.
[325:05.17]Eight.
[325:05.45]Good.
[325:05.89]Alright.
[325:06.52]This is starting to shape up a little bit.
[325:11.92]Nine.
[325:31.78]Okay.
[325:33.56]This offer's getting bigger.
[325:35.76]Uh-oh.
[325:37.10]The million's still there.
[325:38.32]The million's still there.
[325:43.91]The million's still there.
[325:44.67]Nobody freak out.
[325:45.07]The million's still there.
[325:45.83]Okay.
[325:45.99]Good.
[325:46.13]Fifteen.
[325:46.47]Very good.
[325:46.69]Okay.
[326:03.58]No deal.
[326:05.74]You ready?
[326:07.46]20.
[326:08.68]That's alright.
[326:13.10]That's alright.
[326:13.88]As long as we get rid of 10, then it's possible that I can take a deal that's over 250,000.
[326:18.00]Ow.
[326:28.47]Okay.
[326:28.89]We're almost at 200k.
[326:30.15]Get rid of the 10.
[326:30.63]Get rid of the 10 and I win.
[326:32.85]Oh, okay.
[326:33.33]236.
[326:33.35]250.
[326:33.59]It's not 250.
[326:34.51]What if I counter-offer?
[327:04.39]I did it.
[327:06.25]I got over.
[327:07.01]I got $250,000.
[327:09.31]I just got $250,000.
[327:13.73]I just won.
[327:17.75]There it is.
[327:18.15]That's cheating?
[327:22.92]How is that cheating?
[327:23.50]It's a gameplay mechanic.
[327:24.34]That's a built-in gameplay mechanic.
[327:26.56]Ow, my ears.
[327:28.34]I guess I'll... Okay, you want it again?
[327:32.30]That counts.
[327:32.88]That's a part of the game.
[327:33.96]You knew that was part of the game.
[327:38.28]Rip to the all-ins.
[327:39.26]Well, guess what?
[327:39.68]We're doing it one more time.
[327:44.83]Get another chance.
[327:50.61]You get another chance.
[327:53.77]It just said, will he get over $250,000?
[327:55.25]It didn't say how I was going to get to $250,000.
[327:57.05]Oh, I have to pay you out.
[327:59.49]How do I do that?
[328:01.70]How do I pay?
[328:05.35]Mods?
[328:07.03]Mods, how do I pay?
[328:07.79]Alright, let's do one more.
[328:15.30]This is it.
[328:20.60]I'm going to pick my case.
[328:21.86]I'm going to pick tenth.
[328:33.63]This is the final one of the night.
[328:34.89]After this, I'm literally leaving.
[328:36.51]I'm turning the stream off.
[328:38.78]Thank you for the raid, by the way, Prezzo.
[328:41.52]Appreciate it.
[328:42.22]Thanks, everybody.
[328:42.84]Welcome.
[328:46.30]What's going on?
[328:48.22]Good to see you.
[328:52.75]Pog, pog, pog, pog, pog.
[328:55.53]What are you guys saying?
[328:58.29]What is it?
[328:59.21]Yeah, 250k again.
[329:00.75]I feel like that's a good enough risk.
[329:08.43]Because tons of people are betting against that.
[329:11.05]But I mean, statistically speaking, it's hard to get over 250.
[329:13.71]But yes, that's the gamble you're willing to take.
[329:15.85]That's the risk you're taking.
[329:22.18]Put your camera over your case.
[329:28.78]Weird.
[329:29.40]That's a very weird request, but okay.
[329:48.12]Why is this such a big deal?
[329:52.60]Alright, let's close it up in 10 seconds.
[329:57.51]I picked 10.
[330:01.19]Why is that so funny?
[330:01.95]Why is this funny?
[330:05.01]Why is this so... It's not even funny.
[330:06.97]This is not funny.
[330:07.59]This is not funny.
[330:08.43]Why is this funny?
[330:11.98]Pretend like you're the case when you get opened.
[330:16.54]Why is this not funny?
[330:17.54]I'm just on 10.
[330:18.14]Alright, let's go.
[330:22.79]I'm ready to pick the first case.
[330:25.39]There's a little pixel to your left.
[330:26.85]I'll fix it.
[330:27.35]Alright, you ready?
[330:36.30]Here I go.
[330:37.88]Bets are locked.
[330:39.74]Three, two, one.
[330:43.54]Excellent.
[330:44.42]Good.
[330:46.67]Good.
[330:50.99]Go to that one, man.
[330:52.51]Nice.
[330:55.69]I told you.
[330:59.88]Go try that one.
[331:01.16]I would say try that one.
[331:05.70]Okay.
[331:13.04]14 sounds like it's gonna pay out.
[331:17.75]You guys can't even see the numbers.
[331:21.77]Two.
[331:22.87]This is a big one.
[331:25.19]You guys can't see the numbers.
[331:26.21]This is stupid.
[331:28.05]I'm literally moving.
[331:28.93]Okay, seven.
[331:42.16]What was it?
[331:44.15]Alright, it's 300k.
[331:45.01]Get me the fuck out of here.
[331:45.81]That was funny for five seconds.
[331:46.79]No deal.
[331:48.07]Alright, not bad.
[331:51.24]50k?
[331:51.48]Okay, that's not great, but whatever.
[331:54.14]3.
[331:54.16]10k? 4.
[332:17.20]Quoted over the lady's face.
[332:28.36]Okay.
[332:28.56]That was 500k?
[332:33.33]Fuck.
[332:34.41]Five.
[332:46.71]Oh, bad.
[332:47.39]Very bad.
[332:48.55]That's a million.
[332:49.27]Oh, you guys are in trouble now.
[332:50.35]Actually in trouble.
[332:50.96]750 still in it.
[332:53.32]Okay.
[332:59.24]That's good.
[333:00.76]Good numbers to come up with.
[333:02.72]How about 11?
[333:05.30]That's pretty good.
[333:13.63]Oh, very brave.
[333:15.09]Time for the next round.
[333:16.51]21.
[333:17.06]Nice one.
[333:20.54]One cent.
[333:20.96]Gone.
[333:23.80]20.
[333:24.10]Get rid of the dollar.
[333:25.70]Excellent.
[333:26.78]Okay.
[333:27.30]Getting interesting.
[333:27.90]22.
[333:29.12]Excellent.
[333:33.26]Deal or no deal.
[333:35.60]That's the spirit.
[333:36.58]Time for the next round.
[333:38.00]26.
[333:38.66]No, 25.
[333:38.80]Nice one.
[333:46.92]23.
[333:50.42]Oh shit.
[333:52.74]We're getting there.
[333:53.38]It's getting close.
[333:54.12]Uh oh.
[333:54.24]That's 168.
[333:54.54]I need a 250 deal.
[333:58.10]Oh shit.
[333:58.30]Okay.
[334:20.04]It's a 50-50 chance that pretty much I win or lose.
[334:23.00]Whatever.
[334:24.20]Get rid of the 50.
[334:26.22]Ooh, this could be it.
[334:27.78]That's it.
[334:29.74]But do I take the deal?
[334:31.91]This is up to me.
[334:35.89]This is up to me.
[334:38.67]Do I take the 750 in the potential?
[334:41.05]I didn't have a chance to do anything.
[334:43.09]What?
[334:43.33]What's going on?
[334:45.84]What just happened?
[334:47.34]Why do they do that?
[334:48.10]Why do they... I don't know why they do that.
[334:50.24]That's fucking annoying.
[334:54.62]I couldn't even think about it for less than 10 seconds.
[335:02.30]But that's like kind of fucking bullshit, don't you think?
[335:04.42]$50?
[335:11.99]Always pick the other case, right?
[335:22.89]I just screwed over everybody.
[335:24.29]We'll do it again.
[335:25.45]One more time and I'm going to speedrun it.
[335:34.60]You already experienced the timer.
[335:35.94]I have the memory of a fucking goldfish, man.
[335:38.92]Alright.
[335:41.62]I have no more money.
[335:42.52]I'm sorry.
[335:43.60]I didn't think it was going to kick me out.
[335:45.36]But I wasn't sure if I was going to take it because I was going for big bucks, not little.
[335:52.55]You should have taken the deal.
[335:53.54]I was thinking about it, but I didn't.
[335:56.18]Alright.
[335:57.36]This is the last one.
[335:57.88]I'm going to speedrun it.
[335:59.78]If you want to bet, bet.
[336:05.82]Yeah.
[336:06.14]Time to bet.
[336:06.64]You got 10 seconds.
[336:07.32]10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[336:08.66]And that's a zero.
[336:10.75]And close it.
[336:22.36]I'm picking number one again.
[336:30.23]Ready?
[336:30.45]Go.
[336:44.38]Good.
[336:45.06]Good.
[336:45.46]Good.
[336:45.84]Good.
[336:46.22]Good.
[336:46.60]Good.
[336:47.02]Good.
[336:47.42]Good.
[336:48.62]Low numbers.
[336:49.56]Low numbers.
[336:55.13]Oh boy.
[336:56.41]Not bad.
[337:03.71]Not bad.
[337:07.69]Low numbers.
[337:09.37]Good.
[337:10.87]Low numbers.
[337:13.62]That's a high number.
[337:14.72]Low numbers.
[337:17.26]750 still there?
[337:30.51]Low number.
[337:32.87]Low numbers.
[337:33.45]Low numbers.
[337:33.95]Good.
[337:39.45]That's not a low number.
[337:41.53]That's a medium number and I don't like to see that.
[337:46.98]There are so many of these.
[337:54.16]100k.
[337:54.38]That's a big number.
[337:56.08]Low numbers only.
[337:56.84]I don't know what to say.
[338:03.45]Sorry.
[338:05.13]It's still possible.
[338:12.93]Okay.
[338:14.17]Low number.
[338:18.57]Nice one.
[338:19.39]Low number.
[338:20.15]Good.
[338:20.93]No deal.
[338:21.45]Oh, very brave.
[338:22.91]Time for the next round.
[338:27.95]It's not looking good.
[338:28.96]Nice one.
[338:39.30]Nice one.
[338:39.96]Is it still possible?
[338:40.86]Of course it is.
[338:41.48]But is it probable?
[338:43.11]Not really.
[338:44.29]No deal.
[338:45.05]That's the spirit.
[338:46.03]Time for the next round.
[338:48.35]Nice one.
[338:48.81]There goes one cent.
[338:54.37]Excellent.
[338:55.15]Alright.
[338:57.15]Oh, very brave.
[338:58.98]Time for the next round.
[339:02.02]Excellent.
[339:02.72]Okay.
[339:04.96]205.
[339:05.00]We're almost there.
[339:06.90]No deal.
[339:07.66]That's the spirit.
[339:08.66]Time for the next round.
[339:11.20]Nice one.
[339:12.82]Deal or no deal.
[339:18.58]Do I?
[339:18.72]I'm gonna take it.
[339:19.24]I'm gonna take it.
[339:19.60]I'm gonna take it.
[339:19.96]I'm gonna take it.
[339:20.32]I'm gonna take it.
[339:20.70]I take the deal.
[339:21.18]I win.
[339:27.60]I would have kept my case, by the way, just to make sure you understand.
[339:31.30]I would have kept my case to the end.
[339:35.37]I was gonna kept my case, which means I would have won anyways.
[339:39.55]So all the people that are freaking out right now in the chat room, I'm sorry to tell you, but I would have won anyways.
[339:50.12]Alright.
[339:52.10]I was going to keep my case.
[339:52.94]I wasn't going to swap it.
[340:00.17]Alright, that's it.
[340:01.23]I'll see you guys later.
[340:03.57]Thanks for watching as always.
[340:04.49]Have a great rest of your evening.
[340:09.74]It's always fun.
[340:19.54]The next time you will see me will be, let's say, Wednesday.
[340:26.57]Wednesday the 1st.
[340:30.11]I'm going to keep it at 3 p.m., and I'm going to tell you why.
[340:35.03]I usually start streaming at 4 o'clock Pacific, but when I say I'm going to stream at 4 o'clock, I always show up at like 4.30, and I'm actually ready to stream at 4.30, 4.15.
[340:46.04]So if I say I'm going to stream at 3, that means that I have to be here, and I'll turn the stream on at like 3.30, right?
[340:54.32]So that makes sense to make it that way.
[341:01.06]I don't know what we're going to do, but I know I have a lot of options.
[341:09.88]I got a lot of things on my Steam list that I want to play.
[341:11.71]I don't know.
[341:16.87]My voice has been getting just junk after like four or five hours.
[341:19.81]I don't know why.
[341:30.63]What's this?
[341:32.73]Oh, this is like my, like, Firefox webpage.
[341:35.87]You can see, like, hotels.com.
[341:37.43]You want to go to hotels.com?
[341:42.78]Cover your body in honey.
[341:44.16]You need to show your YouTube history.
[341:52.92]I'm not showing my YouTube history.
[341:59.16]Solve the riddle.
[342:01.50]Can you solve Albert Einstein's famous... Okay, let's see if I can do it.
[342:08.44]Why am I so stretched?
[342:09.50]What's the famous house riddle?
[342:17.33]Let's find out.
[342:20.19]Why am I so stretched?
[342:22.73]Okay.
[342:22.85]Alright, and these... Okay, hold on, let's see.
[342:31.21]The Englishman lives in the house with red walls.
[342:34.95]The Swede keeps dogs.
[342:37.57]The Dane drinks tea.
[342:39.35]The house with green walls is just to the left of the house with white... I don't care.
[342:44.63]Like, you do it.
[342:45.21]I don't want to do it.
[342:54.52]Thanks for watching.
[342:56.78]I thought it was going to be a simple thing.
[342:58.10]It's like a 15-step riddle.
[342:59.38]I'm not doing it.
[343:05.12]for watching see you guys Wednesday at three o'clock pacific ish got a lot of to play well but you know in pre-stream we'll do a poll thanks for the subs there were actually let me see

[343:42.97]I feel like I'm going to have a lot of stuff to talk about really soon.
[343:46.69]So there should be some really interesting things we can go over.
[343:49.79]I'll have some green screen updates for you this week coming up.
