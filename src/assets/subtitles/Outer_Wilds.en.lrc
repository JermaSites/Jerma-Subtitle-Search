[00:01.35]Hey.
[00:03.01]The title sucks.
[00:03.87]Yeah, I know.
[00:06.61]I don't know anything about this game.
[00:08.43]I don't know how to title this game.
[00:10.74]I know it's about you're in space.
[00:13.16]You're searching around.
[00:14.84]I don't know anything about the game.
[00:16.38]You're searching around space.
[00:17.32]You're yearning, wanting.
[00:18.70]I don't know.
[00:19.58]Whatever.
[00:19.90]It's staying.
[00:20.20]I don't care.
[00:24.50]I know that this is a very spoiler-filled video game.
[00:28.58]So I'm going to do my best to not pay attention to chat.
[00:32.78]It's going to be really hard for me to do that.
[00:35.49]And we'll be talking in pre-stream chat about how...
[00:38.70]Oh, dude, just put it in sub only.
[00:40.70]Well, I'm not sure that's going to do very much, considering that almost all of you at this point are subscribed to the channel.
[00:48.57]There's almost 11,000 subs on this channel, so all I would do would be flipping a switch that doesn't have a light bulb plugged in.
[00:56.92]Let's turn the lights on for this one.
[00:59.58]Oh, there's no bulb in there, but I flipped the switch.
[01:03.28]So, we're just going to let it ride.
[01:04.58]Let it ride.
[01:10.62]uh I'm gonna try to not look too far into what people are saying someone just I did a wink good I can see that I can actually see the real one all right uh fifty dollars from five can we okay I'm gonna rename you phylactery 50.
[01:39.32]Phylactery50 is your new name, because you give $50 or more every single stream.
[01:50.10]You've got money to spend, and I cannot believe you still give this much money.
[01:56.44]It's unbelievable.
[01:57.68]I can't believe it.
[01:58.58]Thank you, PhylacteryLich, for the 5,000 bits.
[02:00.18]I'm actually going to get my better dashboard here.
[02:09.07]We're going to play Outer Wilds today.
[02:10.43]I was going to do Tony Hawk's Underground, but we're going to have to move Tony Hawk's Underground because I needed an official Xbox 360 hard drive.
[02:18.18]It's been ordered.
[02:18.90]You can't get it anywhere.
[02:20.44]I can't get it anywhere in real life.
[02:22.56]So I have to buy it online, so it's got to ship.
[02:24.46]So we're going to do that at the end of the week.
[02:27.95]I actually have a full plan for the rest of this week, if you believe it.
[02:31.77]But Phylactery said with his 5,000 bit donations, Hey Jerma, play the DLC for Asura's Wrath or I'll eat a fucking delicious Caesar salad.
[02:40.36]Good stream last night, hope you enjoyed the game.
[02:42.14]Yeah, that's the plan.
[02:42.96]That's in the plan.
[02:44.32]You guys ready for the plan?
[02:46.86]Here is the plan.
[02:49.16]Today, Outer Wilds.
[02:51.43]No, not Outer Worlds.
[02:53.21]Outer Wilds.
[02:55.91]This is a different game than the one you think it is.
[03:00.29]Maybe tomorrow.
[03:01.91]Outer Wilds.
[03:02.77]This game is apparently, what, 10, 12 hours long?
[03:06.95]We could probably split this into two, like, six, seven hour streams.
[03:09.59]Something like that.
[03:13.11]After that.
[03:13.67]So that's today and tomorrow.
[03:15.09]For you, it's going to be 20.
[03:18.81]Well, we'll see if we can do it in two.
[03:21.54]So today and tomorrow, Outer Wilds.
[03:22.94]Friday, Tony Hawk's Underground.
[03:25.16]I'll have the hard drive by then.
[03:27.80]Tony Hawk's Underground, it can be done in one stream.
[03:30.36]I'm certain of it because I remember playing it.
[03:33.04]Saturday.
[03:34.44]Diablo 2 Hardcore.
[03:37.56]Going after Diablo with our skeleton necromancer.
[03:41.84]Depending on how long that stream goes, possibly a Sir's Wrath DLC.
[03:46.93]Now, I also want to address this as well.
[03:49.55]Uh... The Get Well card... I'd like to experience by myself.
[03:55.65]I looked into it a little bit, and that's something that I don't think I would like to stream.
[03:58.93]I want to experience it on my own.
[04:03.52]Uh... It seems a little personal for me, so I definitely want to, over the next few nights, do it on my own.
[04:14.66]Thank you, everybody that's contributed...
[04:18.04]I'm not just saying this.
[04:20.72]I'm actually going to go through every single slide over the next three or four nights.
[04:25.12]So, thank you again, but I do want to experience it on my own.
[04:34.06]The what?
[04:35.04]A ton of people contributed to a get well card for me.
[04:39.01]Which is insane.
[04:40.11]Because I've been having some stupid annoying medical problems with some rib cage bullshit.
[04:45.67]And people are nice enough to want to come together and do that.
[04:51.89]Thank you all of you.
[04:53.98]I will be experiencing it over the next few nights.
[04:59.80]Uh, we had another $50 come in right now.
[05:01.91]5,000 bits from AB Joe.
[05:05.83]5,000 from Phylactery, 5,000 from AB Joe.
[05:09.47]I always thought that the German Merc was wearing a scarf or something.
[05:12.67]After looking at it on mobile, he just has a really weird chin.
[05:17.41]Well, it's Mercury.
[05:23.26]It's just Thanos.
[05:27.46]But that's the plan for the remainder of the week.
[05:31.04]Should be some interesting stuff here.
[05:33.06]Outer Wilds is one of those games.
[05:36.02]Remember, we're fulfilling our quota on this stream.
[05:39.11]I'm playing a game that came out within the last year.
[05:43.07]We have to fulfill that quota.
[05:44.17]I've got to play at least one recent game for every ten old games.
[05:51.40]Did another wink just come in?
[06:00.39]We're gonna start to see a lot more of these.
[06:01.99]Play Devil May Cry 5.
[06:04.03]For fuck's sake.
[06:07.00]I probably will.
[06:10.72]But we're gonna do Outer Wilds.
[06:11.94]Let's just move on to it.
[06:12.72]Let's go.
[06:13.23]I'm ready to go.
[06:13.79]Hopefully you're ready to go.
[06:15.49]Hopefully you got like a snack or something or... Something.
[06:20.18]Art of the Wilds.
[06:21.36]Now, I gotta make sure I reiterate this again.
[06:28.67]I'm just gonna kind of experience this game.
[06:30.59]I'm not gonna be paying too much attention to chat because I've been told.
[06:33.87]I can spoil, like, the last season of this show in one sentence, right?
[06:39.68]So, like, I gotta be careful.
[06:40.80]And please...
[06:42.48]We're not gonna do sub only, but just know that, you know, if you drop a fucking spoiler line here, you're out.
[06:49.41]You're gone.
[06:50.21]Like, you're gone.
[06:51.27]You're out.
[06:53.43]So, we're, uh... I'm not gonna put it in emote only.
[06:59.62]Don't ignore me.
[07:00.52]Did another wink come in?
[07:06.32]No.
[07:07.12]Wait, what?
[07:09.93]No, only what?
[07:11.09]Yeah, another one just came in.
[07:12.75]What the fuck?
[07:17.25]I was going to keep this up for a minute because I feel like we're going to get a shitload of these.
[07:26.96]Another one.
[07:27.54]No, I got I actually have it up on my dashboard.
[07:29.82]I can see when they're fake.
[07:35.20]All right, let's get started.
[07:37.56]I've been told that this is one of the best games of the year from last year.
[07:42.30]I'm curious.
[07:43.34]I want to know why.
[07:44.04]I'm playing with a controller, by the way.
[07:45.35]I've heard the music's good.
[07:50.45]I've heard the game is good.
[07:51.25]I've heard it's really fun, really interesting.
[07:53.93]Outer Wilds.
[07:55.01]Are we ready?
[08:01.18]You're in Normie.
[08:02.84]Normie.
[08:08.92]Whatever.
[08:11.84]Loading?
[08:12.66]This is weird.
[08:14.87]This game needs a controller to be good.
[08:16.73]I got one in my hands right now.
[08:21.05]Wake up.
[08:27.69]Hmm.
[08:32.77]Is it FPS?
[08:35.12]Oh, it is FPS.
[08:42.67]Talk to Slate.
[08:44.81]Roast a marshmallow.
[08:45.68]We're doing that first.
[08:51.50]Oh.
[08:52.52]Oh, goddammit!
[08:53.38]I've ruined it.
[08:55.44]Although... You gotta go all in.
[09:05.40]Oops.
[09:07.53]If you end up lighting it on fire, you gotta go all in.
[09:10.29]And then you pull the charcoal mess off the top and you eat it.
[09:19.02]No, I wanted to eat it.
[09:22.73]Why am I so bad at this?
[09:32.66]I get so obsessive-compulsive when it comes to roasting marshmallows.
[09:36.62]Every single centimeter of this whole thing has to be a golden brown.
[09:41.88]Or you go all in and you burn the fuck out of it.
[09:44.38]It lights on fire and then, like I said, you peel it off.
[09:48.51]Like that.
[09:49.09]You let it burn.
[09:51.09]Blow it out.
[09:52.15]Pull off the weird exoskeleton that's on it.
[09:54.25]Eat the exoskeleton and then suck on the fucking juices inside.
[09:56.87]Alright, that was good.
[09:59.35]Let's go.
[10:01.87]There's already more gameplay than yesterday's stream.
[10:07.17]What do you say?
[10:07.67]Ready to get this beauty off the ground?
[10:08.93]It's all fueled up and ready to go.
[10:11.10]Uh... Be sure you fix the retro rockets.
[10:31.34]That was only a problem one time, and then maybe a few times after that.
[10:34.08]But hey, no reason to dwell on the past, right?
[10:37.35]Anyway, you'll need to get the launch codes from Hornfels at the observatory before you can lift off.
[10:41.97]Just bring those here once you've said your goodbyes or whatever.
[10:45.25]Right to the point, I like it.
[10:47.41]Launch codes from Hornfels.
[10:55.98]Okay.
[11:03.63]Requires launch codes.
[11:05.07]Oh, shit.
[11:06.69]Can I have a... Jump.
[11:13.34]A hold and release?
[11:15.54]That's kind of weird.
[11:22.46]Holy shit.
[11:23.38]Fly model ship?
[11:27.48]Wait a minute.
[11:27.92]Hold on.
[11:28.72]Hey, who...
[11:30.94]Hey, it's you.
[11:32.24]Slate said you're blasting off on your ship today.
[11:34.04]I'm really excited to see the launch.
[11:36.22]Aren't you going to go into space?
[11:37.54]Aren't you?
[11:37.86]You better not have changed your mind.
[11:41.48]I want to practice before I leave.
[11:42.84]Oh, you're just saying that.
[11:43.95]But if you really want to practice, I guess I can help you.
[11:45.73]I can learn how to fly.
[11:48.53]Try to land on one of the geyser pools.
[11:50.11]Show me what you got.
[11:50.67]Am I in it?
[11:58.70]I'm in this?
[12:04.57]Okay, that's not as easy as I thought it was going to be How do I drive it?
[12:17.71]How do you fly?
[12:19.63]Up-down thrust?
[12:20.85]Horizontal thrust?
[12:34.07]Guys, I don't think I can do this.
[12:38.13]Horizontal, like you go forward.
[12:47.83]It's like doing way too much thrust.
[12:49.93]You know what I'm saying?
[12:51.79]It's going too fast.
[12:55.42]It's less than four buttons, Jerma.
[12:56.93]I... Okay.
[12:59.67]How do you turn?
[13:06.69]Okay, I'm serious.
[13:07.49]I don't understand this.
[13:10.99]You're thrusting too fast?
[13:12.17]Is it... Is it pressure sensitive?
[13:18.28]I mean, I'm holding it down kind of...
[13:40.19]Was I not supposed to do that?
[14:01.86]Get in the geyser!
[14:13.55]Is it my Xbox controller that's doing it so much?
[14:17.61]It's like, I'm trying not to do too much pressure, but my Xbox One controller is blowing it out.
[14:21.95]I did it.
[14:23.68]I did it, okay.
[14:35.60]I'm done, right?
[14:36.57]Leave.
[14:37.01]Okay, no, I got it.
[14:38.47]I guess I kind of understand.
[14:42.32]Wow, that was just like the time the external fuel tanks exploded on re-entry.
[14:46.38]You'll be okay flying the big one, right?
[14:48.12]I hope so.
[14:48.53]I don't know, you tell me.
[14:51.75]Who's this?
[14:57.62]Horphy.
[14:59.35]That looks like you.
[15:24.68]No, this guy looks like, you know those images that hurt your head?
[15:28.30]When you put two eyes underneath somebody, like a human's eyes, and it's like that weird image where they have four eyes and it hurts your head looking at it?
[15:38.79]That's what I see.
[15:39.47]An iron stomach is the mark of a true Parthian, my friend.
[15:42.94]Our hardy hunter-gatherer lifestyle stems from trial and error.
[15:45.80]By which I mean our ancestors survived eating a lot of bad things.
[15:48.62]Alright, let's go.
[15:53.25]Where's my ship?
[15:54.40]There's a lot of people.
[15:56.00]You're actually blasting off in that thing, huh?
[15:58.12]I told my odds of survival are statistically quite high.
[16:01.68]Yeah, the space program's certainly come a long way.
[16:03.74]I should probably thank you for causing fewer flash fires than your predecessors.
[16:07.35]By the way, good luck with those retro rockets.
[16:12.05]Alright, for a second, I thought that was something bad happening.
[16:15.67]Outer Wilds Adventures presents Postcards from Orbit.
[16:19.22]Use satellite camera?
[16:21.77]This projector is linked to our sky shutter satellite, which is currently orbiting Timber Hearth.
[16:27.79]The satellite is equipped with two onboard cameras.
[16:30.33]See if you can take a snapshot of our village.
[16:53.58]Where's the village?
[16:54.76]Oh, there's a geyser.
[16:58.42]Right?
[17:05.36]Am I doing this wrong?
[17:06.60]Alright, there's a village right here.
[17:10.62]Right?
[17:11.78]That's us.
[17:15.72]Alright, cool.
[17:16.26]I got it.
[17:16.58]That's cool.
[17:19.00]Alright, moving on.
[17:26.77]What do you sell, maps?
[17:28.13]Marl.
[17:28.65]So it's launch day.
[17:29.55]How's going to miss you?
[17:31.11]Speaking of launch day, I was thinking about it in the platform those ships launch from is getting old.
[17:34.73]Isn't it about time you built a new, less flammable one?
[17:38.58]That big tree in the village would be perfect choice.
[17:40.88]I wouldn't mind helping the space program.
[17:42.36]Just say the word.
[17:45.72]Launch pad is flammable?
[17:48.04]Ah, you didn't realize that.
[17:49.04]Don't worry, it's held up for the launches so far.
[17:50.82]It'll definitely be fine for yours, probably.
[17:57.60]Oh, it's the guy with the guitar.
[18:00.46]Hello there, Space Cadet.
[18:01.38]I hear you're leaving the crater today.
[18:02.72]If you meet any of the other travelers up there, remind them to take proper care of their instruments, won't you?
[18:07.01]What are the instruments?
[18:09.81]Oh, sure.
[18:10.13]I made all their instruments, you know.
[18:11.19]Let me see.
[18:11.59]There's church drums, Ryebeck's banjo, and Gabbro's flute.
[18:18.35]And Feldspar's harmonica, of course.
[18:21.15]Though Feldspar's been missing for a long time.
[18:22.71]Sometimes it feels like yesterday they were playing their harmonica around the campfire.
[18:26.76]Anyway, you hear music in space.
[18:28.90]That'll be one of the space program's other travelers.
[18:30.96]If you feel like company, you can always pull out your signal scope and track them down.
[18:35.40]Alright, let's get those launch codes.
[18:45.85]So many people to talk to.
[18:46.75]What are you guys listening to?
[18:50.46]Hello, astronaut.
[18:51.38]If it isn't my favorite troublemaker, what's with the radio?
[18:55.00]We wanted to play hide-and-seek, but Moiraine won't let us borrow their signal scope.
[18:58.56]Because it's really delicate, and I'm not supposed to be thrown around like that.
[19:01.42]Hey, can we use your signal scope?
[19:03.78]Can we?
[19:04.13]Can we please?
[19:06.47]Sure, let's play.
[19:07.49]Well, okay, here, it's like a tutorial.
[19:10.67]Galena and me will hide with these radios, and you will use your signal scope to find us.
[19:15.47]Last one to be found wins.
[19:16.63]Okay, close your eyes.
[19:20.67]My money's gonna be gone.
[19:21.47]Alright.
[19:26.58]Frequency.
[19:27.42]Change frequency.
[19:28.28]Zoom in.
[19:38.37]Unknown.
[19:39.47]Isn't this the person playing the guitar?
[19:43.09]No.
[19:46.51]Oh, it's up there.
[19:49.52]How do I get up there?
[19:52.62]Shoot and add an NPC.
[19:57.87]I don't think so.
[19:58.61]Alright, is this game dark?
[20:11.86]For me, it's like the darks are too dark and the lights aren't light enough for my screen.
[20:15.42]I don't know why.
[20:20.63]Alright, can I get up here and jump?
[20:26.51]Alright, found you.
[20:29.70]Got ya.
[20:33.00]You found me.
[20:36.78]I did.
[20:37.04]Now where's the other one?
[20:40.39]I get how this works.
[20:43.95]Is there fall damage or anything?
[20:45.01]No.
[20:49.58]Down in here?
[20:50.02]Can I go... Can I die?
[20:59.77]Where are you?
[21:00.25]Like, under the waterfall?
[21:08.52]I don't understand.
[21:10.54]Not there, apparently, no.
[21:20.69]It's going to be up here.
[21:21.43]Oh, there you are.
[21:25.61]This shit is dark.
[21:26.51]You got me, but I'm the last one.
[21:31.40]I win.
[21:31.82]I promise you'll play again when you get back from space.
[21:34.50]Okay, gotta go.
[21:40.64]Me too.
[21:41.28]Let's get those codes.
[21:44.22]Should I, or is it just this kind of personal area that's dark?
[21:54.49]Don't, okay.
[21:55.73]Alright, what the hell was that?
[22:00.07]Use camera?
[22:00.97]There's so many gadgets.
[22:05.63]What are all these gadgets?
[22:14.37]What was that?
[22:17.90]Hi, Astronaut.
[22:18.48]You know the patch of ghost matter inside this fence?
[22:20.70]Ghosts said it used to be bigger when they were hatching.
[22:22.83]Because ghost matter evaporates.
[22:25.15]It just takes a super long time to go away.
[22:28.85]There's still ghost matter in the village when I'm grown up.
[22:31.41]Ghost matter is awesome.
[22:35.12]Shouldn't be throwing rocks in there.
[22:36.34]It's dangerous.
[22:37.92]Obviously, that's what makes it so awesome.
[22:39.26]Geez, I'm not dumb enough to touch it.
[22:41.00]Oh, you're such a grown-up.
[22:45.37]Yes, I am.
[22:46.79]I don't throw rock stuff.
[22:49.88]I saw smoke coming from Youngbark Crater up north and figured I should go check it out.
[22:53.48]You can use the Scout Launcher.
[22:54.52]Just please don't break it while I'm gone.
[23:01.87]Scout Launcher.
[23:04.37]Launch Scout.
[23:06.35]What the fuck is going on?
[23:09.65]Okay, so I fire... This is a cannon camera.
[23:14.61]Oh, it's still flying.
[23:17.45]Oh, shit.
[23:18.43]Alright, get it back.
[23:19.91]I want to see what I look like.
[23:27.51]Hold on.
[23:28.01]What do I look like?
[23:28.63]That's me, right?
[23:33.00]Alright, that's cool.
[23:36.62]Where are those codes?
[23:37.14]I'm going to go to the observatory.
[23:43.77]Birds fly.
[23:47.23]Sun shines.
[23:49.95]Alright, this way.
[24:00.76]Why does this remind me of Firewatch?
[24:04.55]The walking with the acoustic guitar in the background is just... I'm waiting for the radio to come up.
[24:18.30]Alright, I'm going the wrong way.
[24:23.38]Big bits just came in.
[24:24.16]Oh shit, they did.
[24:25.64]You're right.
[24:25.98]Hold on.
[24:27.98]I just missed it.
[24:28.52]Alright, here we go.
[24:33.56]Whoa!
[24:36.87]Dude, it's bright.
[24:38.23]It's really bright now.
[24:39.51]Oh, because the sun is coming up.
[24:41.71]Alright, now I get it.
[24:42.73]Yeah, sun.
[24:43.61]Sunshine.
[24:44.45]Sunshine.
[24:47.23]Alright, hold on.
[24:48.29]Parfallamule gave 5,044 bits.
[24:51.01]Thank you, Parfallamule.
[24:52.83]50 bucks.
[24:54.17]Say, this might be the only time I ever donate so many bits at once since I can by no means afford it often.
[24:58.73]Don't ever give me money if you can't afford it for any reason.
[25:03.63]Like, if you give this channel money, make sure you can afford it a hundred times before you even think to do it once.
[25:11.55]Uh, but very important.
[25:12.98]That's very important.
[25:13.68]But this is my absolute favorite game of recent years, and I'm so excited and happy that my favorite internet man has given it a chance.
[25:18.86]Hope you and Chad enjoy this masterpiece.
[25:20.74]I've heard it's very good.
[25:24.98]I've heard it's very, very good.
[25:28.56]Read that stuff.
[25:29.31]Oh, I'm not supposed to be looking at Chad.
[25:31.03]Alright.
[25:33.09]I'm not gonna look at Chad.
[25:33.77]I'm not gonna look at Chad.
[25:34.41]I'm not supposed to be looking at you guys.
[25:42.33]Boring.
[25:42.81]As it grows older, the star runs out of hydrogen and starts to contract.
[25:45.83]I'm not gonna lie, when I first passed this, I thought these were fruits.
[26:08.91]I thought it was, like, apple, peach, nectarine.
[26:11.93]I didn't realize it.
[26:12.67]Like, when I walked by them and I glanced over, I was like, oh, those are pretty good nectarines.
[26:17.04]If a star is massive enough, it will continue to fuse carbon into even heavier elements like iron.
[26:21.74]Ultimately, the star will collapse under its own gravity and explode in a violent event called a supernova.
[26:26.85]Based on Chert's observations, this will one day be the fate of our own sun.
[26:32.68]Monka.
[26:33.94]Fucking ass.
[26:35.84]Right guys?
[26:37.12]This anglerfish specimen was found attached to the landing gear of one of our ships that flew close to Dark Bramble.
[26:43.39]It appears well suited to living in dark places with minimal atmosphere.
[26:49.13]What's this?
[26:50.35]This crystal was taken from a Nomai ruin on Brittle Hollow.
[26:54.35]It seems to create a local gravity distortion and was most likely used to traverse steep surfaces.
[26:59.06]Try it out.
[27:04.52]Get me out.
[27:05.09]Get me off.
[27:05.43]Get me off.
[27:05.79]Get me off.
[27:06.07]I'm gonna throw up.
[27:13.45]If I had stood on that platform for another 10 seconds, I would have had to turn the stream off.
[27:20.50]Cool.
[27:21.26]I'm serious.
[27:21.82]I'm dead serious.
[27:26.16]What you see here are parts of the Nomai's skeleton.
[27:29.18]I'm sorry, I just bumped you in the face.
[27:30.90]We can tell from their skulls that they possessed antlers and quite unusually only three eyes.
[27:35.91]The Nomai body was likely adapted for living exclusively on land.
[27:39.45]The differences in the Nomai's anatomy, such as their shockingly fragile bones, show us that Parthians couldn't have descended from Nomaean ancestors.
[27:49.24]It's not clear where the Nomai originated from, or why they disappeared.
[27:52.30]We hope to find more clues to this puzzle as we explore our solar system.
[27:58.97]All right.
[27:59.61]Nice.
[27:59.75]There's a little museum.
[28:01.01]The sofa.
[28:03.18]chair or something, or like a vase.
[28:05.46]Aside from the dwellings and structures they built, the Nomai also made art.
[28:09.08]This decorated pottery was discovered on Brittle Hollow.
[28:11.50]Some ancient Nomai art depicts strange animals, foreign celestial objects, and other subjects that can't be found in our solar system, which makes us wonder whether the Nomai originated elsewhere in the universe or simply had vibrant imaginations.
[28:24.61]Were the Nomai born in our solar system?
[28:27.01]Or were they born among other stars and planets?
[28:30.02]If they were, how and why did they come here?
[28:33.58]All this and more on this episode of NPR.
[28:38.23]These are just some of the questions we hope to answer through further Xenoarcheological expeditions.
[28:49.63]Bowling balls.
[28:51.46]Alright, pretty cool.
[28:52.24]I got all this info.
[28:54.86]This is a face.
[28:56.81]This remarkably intact statue was carved by the Nomai, an ancient species who dwelled in our solar system thousands of years ago.
[29:02.49]We keep touching on the Nomai here.
[29:05.35]The statue provides us with our most detailed look yet at the Nomai, who appear to have been covered with a layer of fur.
[29:11.61]Note the decorative jewelry that has been carved as part of the antlers.
[29:16.35]Although their artifacts and structures have been found on almost every planet in the solar system, we still have no idea where the species came from or what happened to them.
[29:25.58]So this is kind of, uh... Kind of like Mayan history, like we have now, where it's like, look, this is a civilization, and... They did all this stuff, they made all these things, but we don't know what happened to them.
[29:42.94]Ow.
[29:43.58]Hey, it's my favorite streamer!
[29:45.40]Launch day at last, huh, buddy?
[29:46.76]It's the Translator Tools inaugural flight, too.
[29:49.52]I'm so excited, it's making me nauseous.
[29:55.15]Just think, you'll be able to translate any Nomai text you want, anywhere you are.
[29:59.33]The two of us put a lot of hours into inventing that tool.
[30:01.83]So don't break it, okay?
[30:02.93]Haha, oh jeez.
[30:07.06]Haha, oh god.
[30:08.70]Do not break it.
[30:09.44]Uh, ignore me, okay?
[30:12.88]I'm just nervous, and I'm not even the one going into space.
[30:14.84]How are you feeling?
[30:15.74]I'm good, I feel good.
[30:17.82]Good, you've only been waiting for this day since we were hatchlings.
[30:20.12]I can't wait to see all your training payoff.
[30:22.76]So what's the dirt?
[30:23.18]You're here to see the new Nomai statue?
[30:26.76]Yeah.
[30:27.96]Yeah.
[30:28.40]I knew you'd want to see it before you headed off.
[30:30.28]Hornfell's just finished prepping it for display today.
[30:32.14]Amazing, isn't it?
[30:33.18]Makes me wish we could see what a real live Nomai looks like.
[30:37.76]But I guess this is as close as we'll ever get.
[30:40.10]Check it out.
[30:40.62]Looks like they had fur.
[30:41.64]Fur is weird.
[30:42.38]This is the first fully intact statue ever found, you know.
[30:46.04]And for how old it is, it's in great shape.
[30:48.94]Ah, jeez.
[30:49.98]I got a little carried away there.
[30:51.26]Go on.
[30:51.62]You have a ship to launch.
[30:52.56]Take care of yourself out there.
[31:01.28]This is the crew.
[31:09.36]So we're aliens.
[31:10.16]Okay.
[31:12.70]Alright.
[31:14.26]Outer Wilds Ventures founding members.
[31:16.40]Clockwise from the top left.
[31:18.36]Hornfels, Gossen, Slate, and Feldspar.
[31:20.90]Which one am I?
[31:25.28]Who am I?
[31:25.84]Am I Esker?
[31:30.53]Hmm, what's that?
[31:32.25]Out of Wild's Ventures, Timber Hearth's first and only space program was founded to explore the farthest reaches of our solar system.
[31:37.77]Feldspar was the first Hearthian to be internationally intentionally launched into space.
[31:43.08]It completed the first orbit around Timber Hearth and later made the first of what would be many landings on our moon, the Attlerock.
[31:56.43]Okay.
[31:57.67]Nice.
[31:57.91]What's this?
[31:59.27]This piece of Nomai writing was essential to describing their unique language.
[32:02.77]Although this text is linear, Nomai text often branches off from a central point.
[32:07.55]Interestingly, each branch tends to be written by a different author.
[32:12.07]Oh, dude, that's fucking pretty cool.
[32:16.82]That's actually really cool.
[32:17.70]Like, from center out?
[32:19.84]That's pretty cool.
[32:21.12]Alright.
[32:21.92]Untranslated writing.
[32:24.60]What about that one?
[32:25.22]What about that one?
[32:26.68]A collab
[32:58.06]Alright.
[32:58.92]Let's get those codes.
[33:01.56]You ma- Uh.
[33:13.41]Alright.
[33:14.42]You are here.
[33:19.78]Giant's Deep.
[33:21.56]Timber Hearth.
[33:23.88]Brittle Hollow.
[33:24.72]Okay.
[33:25.58]Let's go.
[33:28.17]Alright, give me those codes.
[33:30.93]There you are.
[33:31.37]I just finished pre-flight observations and local conditions are good.
[33:33.95]Time to get our newest astronaut off the ground.
[33:36.55]You'll be our first astronaut ever equipped with a Nomai translator tool.
[33:40.68]I confess I've been giddy all day just thinking about it.
[33:43.54]We're better equipped than ever to unravel the mysteries of the Nomai.
[33:46.38]You and Hal should be very proud of your work.
[33:50.00]Tell me, what's your plan once you're in space?
[33:53.31]Uh... I think I'm going to start with something small.
[33:59.16]That's a sensible plan.
[34:00.08]More sensible than most of our astronauts tend to be, and that's a fact.
[34:03.12]You think you'll go to the Attle Rock then?
[34:04.78]Our moon would be a safe place to travel and to get your bearings in space.
[34:08.88]And I'm sure Esker would appreciate the visit.
[34:12.43]Plus, we don't know what the ancient Nomai ruins on the moon are or why they were built.
[34:16.49]You could put your new translator tool to... Alright, yeah, that sounds simple.
[34:22.07]Fly right... I want to fly into the sun!
[34:26.29]Okay.
[34:27.60]Yeah, man.
[34:28.60]There ain't no translating text on the sun.
[34:30.84]You die if you go near it.
[34:33.46]But... We'll make sure we start training the other hatchlings to replace you.
[34:38.34]Real soon.
[34:39.00]Take a few photos.
[34:40.52]Don't worry.
[34:41.57]I plan on taking at least three photos and then opening the window and whipping the phone out.
[34:45.71]And then one day somebody will find it.
[34:48.67]It's actually pretty interesting.
[34:50.67]I got the idea because I found a cell phone flying around in space.
[34:55.80]There was a picture of this planet with these giant fucking tentacles coming out of it.
[35:00.42]It's the new message in a bottle, man.
[35:02.32]Get with it.
[35:02.78]I'm ready.
[35:11.51]Excellent.
[35:11.79]You'll be needing the launch codes.
[35:12.93]Here they are.
[35:13.31]Okay.
[35:16.85]Launch codes.
[35:18.61]Dash, dash, dash, dot, dot, dash, dot.
[35:25.92]I don't know what that says.
[35:26.62]That's amazing lore enrichment.
[35:37.43]Wait, hold on.
[35:38.23]What is this?
[35:39.05]Magic rock.
[35:42.69]This strange rock moving around in this grotto appears to react to conscious observation.
[35:47.56]The level headed among us realized there must be some sort of optical illusion at play.
[35:52.73]But Gabriel claims the rock exists in all possible states until it is observed.
[35:57.97]Whatever is actually happening, both sides of the debate agree the effect of extremely creepy.
[36:04.17]I get it.
[36:04.49]Oh.
[36:08.79]That is pretty weird.
[36:20.39]Okay.
[36:22.21]Low IQ astronaut.
[36:31.27]You made it out of that rock?
[36:32.83]Okay.
[36:40.11]I want to make a Game of Thrones reference so bad, but I can't.
[36:43.59]Is it a- Did you let him touch you?
[36:46.32]Did he touch you?
[36:50.62]What the hell was that?
[36:58.77]It just, alright, it just, it just, I did, it just absorbed everything I did.
[37:04.07]Do it at, no, I can't do it.
[37:05.45]Alright, that was weird.
[37:12.39]Big thanks to these additional funding members of Outer Wilds Ventures, without whom we would never have gotten off the ground.
[37:17.74]Matthew Steinhauer, Ben Etherdington,
[37:22.85]These Kickstarter people?
[37:26.83]Patreon subs?
[37:30.51]Alright, thanks guys.
[37:38.33]These are actual patrons of the Kickstarter.
[37:44.63]That's pretty cool.
[37:46.67]That's a neat little place to put it.
[37:47.91]Alright, I got the codes.
[37:55.17]Hey, hey, did you get a good look at the Nomai statue?
[37:59.02]The statue was glowing.
[38:00.26]Why was it glowing?
[38:01.70]Whoa, whoa, whoa, the statue was doing what?
[38:04.26]So it's eyes open and you saw images from your own memories and glowing lights flying around?
[38:08.20]You mean like a hallucination?
[38:09.82]Listen, no offense, but are you sure you're okay to launch, like medically speaking?
[38:16.23]No, that statue's definitely weird.
[38:19.04]If you're saying it happened, then I guess maybe it did, but why?
[38:22.29]Hornfels tried everything to get that statue's eyes to open, and nothing like this ever happened to them.
[38:27.51]I don't think you're going to get any answers from the museum statue, but Gabbro said they were going back to Giant's Deep.
[38:33.65]Don't know which island they're on, though.
[38:36.76]Maybe they'd be able to tell you more.
[38:38.08]On the other hand, Gabbro is, you know, Gabbro.
[38:40.20]So maybe you'd better search for info on your own.
[38:43.22]He's a fucking, you know, he's a dick.
[38:45.52]Geez, now I'm really jealous you're going into space.
[38:47.21]Hey, see if you can use our translator tool to find out more about the statue, okay?
[38:51.73]Good luck!
[38:55.03]Is that a carrot?
[38:55.73]Oh, it's a stick.
[39:02.90]It was a lot faster getting back here guys, come on.
[39:37.91]What do you mean it was not?
[39:40.01]Uh-oh, he's got the launch codes.
[39:44.11]I'm gonna refill my health.
[39:55.26]Can I just eat him?
[40:04.48]Here we go.
[40:05.80]Enter launch codes.
[40:10.65]Alright, I was going to say, this is not going to like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, right?
[40:24.09]Let's go.
[40:33.14]What do I do?
[40:34.02]View ship log.
[40:36.50]View entry.
[40:37.24]Timber Hearth.
[40:38.08]Rumor mode?
[40:41.39]Village.
[40:44.39]View rumored entry.
[40:45.57]I hear there are Nomai runes somewhere in the Attlerock.
[40:47.89]Oh, okay, so you get to... Sounds like Esker's still stationed at the Attlerock.
[40:52.67]They've been there by themselves for a while.
[40:54.21]Alright, let's go.
[40:55.43]I'm going to the moon.
[41:00.77]Suit up.
[41:05.37]Little Scout.
[41:06.49]See beyond the horizon.
[41:08.17]Illuminate dark areas.
[41:10.39]Detect hazards.
[41:12.01]Test the environment.
[41:19.74]Health in full fuel.
[41:21.18]Alright, let's go.
[41:22.14]How do I close the door?
[41:24.80]Alright, buckle up.
[41:29.49]Liftoff.
[41:30.67]Landing camera.
[41:31.71]Liftoff.
[41:41.15]Am I in space?
[41:52.74]Holy shit.
[41:58.86]This is crazy.
[42:00.72]Alright, wait.
[42:01.42]What's that?
[42:02.24]I need to find the mo- Where's the planet I just came from?
[42:05.32]Where's the planet I just came from?
[42:07.20]Right there, right?
[42:11.78]Alright, I need to go to Attle Rock.
[42:14.49]Is that Attle Rock?
[42:15.33]Brittle Hollow.
[42:15.97]No, I need Attle Rock.
[42:17.21]I want to go to the moon first.
[42:18.35]They said that was the easy one.
[42:22.91]Giant's Deep?
[42:23.53]No.
[42:27.51]Ember?
[42:29.82]Right there?
[42:30.14]Brittle Hollow?
[42:33.62]No.
[42:34.16]Use the map.
[42:37.62]You are here.
[42:40.73]The Interloper.
[42:41.69]What is that?
[42:43.23]Alright, we need a... Battle Rock.
[42:48.08]There it is.
[42:48.44]Okay, lock on.
[42:50.36]Let's go.
[42:55.68]Engage autopilot.
[42:58.03]Match velocity.
[43:02.43]How fast am I?
[43:04.01]Wait, it's right there.
[43:04.49]It's right there.
[43:04.85]Okay, slow down.
[43:09.09]All right, so I'm gonna do autopilot.
[43:10.55]Engage autopilot.
[43:12.09]I'm bigger than this planet is.
[43:22.06]Match velocity?
[43:22.94]All right, slow down, slow down, slow down.
[43:32.20]Where's my miles per hour?
[43:43.44]I gotta get picked up by the gravity.
[43:46.14]How do I get in here?
[43:48.25]Landing mode.
[43:50.25]What the fuck is happening?
[43:58.55]Is this right?
[43:59.10]This is the camera on the bottom, right?
[44:04.72]I'm not driving straight into this, am I?
[44:11.69]No, I got it.
[44:15.95]Let's go.
[44:21.25]Oh, nice.
[44:21.63]Alright, I made it.
[44:23.37]Do I have, like, all my tools?
[44:24.33]Hold on, where are my tools?
[44:27.69]Equip scout launcher.
[44:29.51]Get the signal scope.
[44:32.29]No, no, no.
[44:32.85]Put it away.
[44:33.23]Alright, unbuckle.
[44:37.29]Let's go.
[44:38.25]I have my suit on.
[44:38.91]Where's the hat?
[44:40.21]Alright, flashlight.
[44:55.92]Holy shit.
[44:57.22]I can... Alright, alright.
[44:59.70]I need to find... What am I looking for?
[45:03.56]I'm trying to find the base of operations.
[45:06.44]This is my ship.
[45:10.84]How do I equip my, um... Translator?
[45:15.23]What's going on?
[45:24.59]What's wrong with me?
[45:51.92]Oh my god.
[45:55.28]We're turning upside down.
[45:56.22]We're going upside down.
[45:59.36]We're upside down.
[45:59.92]I don't like this.
[46:02.56]Okay, I need to find writing and some clues.
[46:07.22]Isn't there a base here?
[46:08.12]Oh.
[46:08.20]This is Mario Galaxy, but the whole world does it.
[46:15.12]Not just one planet.
[46:18.58]Get out of there.
[46:19.18]Get out of there.
[46:19.64]Let me get out of here.
[46:23.76]What is that thing?
[46:25.36]What is that?
[46:32.71]Run!
[46:33.19]What do you mean, run?
[46:40.01]It's the sun!
[46:46.67]What the hell is that?
[46:49.25]Ah!
[46:52.30]No, someone's playing a harmonica.
[46:54.02]No, no, that's my friend.
[46:54.90]It's a friend.
[46:58.89]Where are you?
[47:04.17]Wait, what is that?
[47:05.91]That's another planet.
[47:07.15]There's people just playing musical instruments.
[47:13.25]Hide and seek?
[47:15.23]Is there nothing on this planet?
[47:18.11]Jump to the other planet?
[47:38.75]Holy shit!
[47:41.19]I made it!
[47:44.76]Ooh!
[48:01.21]Yeah, we reviewed the logs.
[48:04.87]I don't think he should have been the one on that case.
[48:08.94]He tried to jump from a moon to a planet.
[48:13.44]Probably wasn't the smartest thing.
[48:17.18]Wait, what?
[48:27.59]Atmospheric.
[48:28.45]Wait, am I?
[48:29.03]Hey, you ready to get this thing off the ground?
[48:31.17]Ship's off fuel and ready to go.
[48:34.25]Did I just die?
[48:36.91]Oh, bad dream or something?
[48:38.09]You still look half asleep, but that's a negative on being deceased.
[48:42.35]I know it's tradition to sleep out under the stars at night before I launch, but if you ask me, it makes you a little jumpy.
[48:57.32]Did I not like that?
[48:58.70]Okay.
[49:00.72]Uh...
[49:06.37]I have the codes.
[49:08.73]I do?
[49:08.99]Oh, I do.
[49:09.81]Oh, hold up.
[49:11.83]You're going to want to get the launch codes from the observatory.
[49:14.19]I already got them.
[49:19.90]Must be inhaling more fumes than I realize.
[49:21.66]That stuff is potent.
[49:23.04]Well, if you get the codes, I'm not going to stop you.
[49:25.16]Good luck and take care of that ship.
[49:29.65]Oh.
[49:37.51]You're huffing paint.
[49:38.45]This is the ship.
[49:40.51]Okay.
[49:51.05]Alright, I'm going back to the moon.
[49:52.65]I'm not jumping from planet to planet this time.
[49:54.51]Suit up.
[49:57.77]Okay, I got full fuel.
[49:59.53]Well, let's go.
[50:04.74]Lift off camera.
[50:05.70]Okay, now I get that.
[50:12.02]LB hold to roll?
[50:19.11]You can actually do a full roll?
[50:20.69]Alright, don't do that anymore.
[50:23.83]That's gonna actually make me sick.
[50:24.91]Alright, let's go back there.
[50:27.75]What the hell?
[50:28.83]I don't even understand what I did.
[50:31.21]Let's lock on.
[50:33.37]Oh my god!
[50:35.62]Get up!
[50:35.86]Go, go, go!
[50:37.48]Pull up!
[50:38.12]Pull up!
[50:38.94]Pull up!
[50:42.96]That was almost a disaster.
[50:46.37]Okay, let's go.
[50:47.99]Same deal, except there's shit on here I have to do.
[50:50.81]What was the thing?
[50:51.75]I gotta look at my log.
[51:00.10]Slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down.
[51:03.38]How fast am I going?
[51:04.26]I can't tell.
[51:06.32]I'm going kind of fast.
[51:10.44]Yeah, right there.
[51:11.16]See?
[51:11.94]There is something on here.
[51:12.92]I knew it.
[51:16.18]Landing mode.
[51:23.95]Jesus.
[51:36.68]We good?
[51:38.66]Am I landed?
[51:39.38]I'm good, right?
[51:40.38]Alright, let's go.
[51:48.33]Alright, let me see.
[51:52.09]What does this say?
[51:54.29]Here we go.
[51:55.21]Room at entry.
[51:56.01]Hey, there are nomai ruins on the Attle Rock.
[51:58.77]Okay.
[52:03.35]I saw them.
[52:03.89]Let's go.
[52:04.11]Over here.
[52:10.95]Don't go so fast!
[52:11.81]Jesus, I'm gonna get killed.
[52:16.53]It's up here.
[52:17.09]We got plenty of fuel, right?
[52:32.81]Where am I going?
[52:33.79]Okay.
[52:34.63]So, let's land here.
[52:39.18]Right here.
[52:39.46]Alright, found him.
[52:41.11]These are the ruins, right?
[52:42.95]Yeah, these look like ruins to me.
[52:47.89]Hold down A. Oh, right.
[52:53.35]Come on, pull this away.
[53:01.22]The fuck is going on?
[53:02.80]What the hell's going on?
[53:05.30]What's going on?
[53:05.74]I'm gonna get hit by this.
[53:07.70]What is this doing?
[53:11.78]Should I go in?
[53:18.57]I'm going in.
[53:21.17]I broke it?
[53:21.87]How did I break it?
[53:22.75]Wait, this is writing.
[53:25.99]Too close.
[53:27.22]Alright, untranslated.
[53:30.28]Hold on, let me go get Otto.
[53:31.24]Otto wants to come in the room.
[53:32.28]Perfect.
[54:12.57]I can hear him yelling at me.
[54:14.73]He's like, hey, open this door right now.
[54:20.40]There.
[54:21.12]Now just relax.
[54:24.22]What happened?
[54:27.12]No, no, he just wanted to come in the room.
[54:31.47]He gets really annoyed if he's not hanging out in the room with you.
[54:37.01]If he's not in the room with me, he'll just be like, um, excuse me.
[54:40.63]What the fuck am I not doing in there?
[54:42.24]And I'm like, yeah, you're right, get in here.
[54:47.14]My special boy.
[54:48.08]Alright, what does this say?
[54:50.40]I was upstairs testing the eye signal locator, and it can hear and follow the signals from the sun.
[54:58.22]Alright.
[54:59.58]What else you got?
[55:01.60]However, something strange is happening when I ask the eye signal locator to follow the eye's signal.
[55:06.82]The device's indicator rotates wildly and never points to just one direction.
[55:16.52]This is a curious result.
[55:18.70]It's possible the eye has stopped calling out its signal.
[55:23.01]I see.
[55:23.67]I most likely calibrated the locator incorrectly.
[55:27.31]Private, my apprentice and I will make adjustments and try again.
[55:33.15]An update.
[55:33.88]Disappointingly, everything is correctly calibrated after all.
[55:39.56]It saddens me to post this.
[55:43.08]Post this?
[55:44.28]My friends, but I believe we need to build a more sophisticated device if we want to find the exact location of the Eye of the Universe.
[55:53.13]Then we will build it.
[55:54.95]Don't lose hope.
[55:56.93]Our search for the Eye is what brought our clan to this place.
[55:59.97]We won't give up so easily.
[56:09.90]Freeze detected.
[56:10.78]Oxygen tank refilled.
[56:12.02]Oh, wait.
[56:12.90]I have oxygen, right.
[56:15.10]They're looking for the Eye of the Universe.
[56:18.65]What's this?
[56:20.99]Okay, wow.
[56:22.09]Wow.
[56:22.61]I've seen this route in other travelers' pictures, but seeing it for myself.
[56:26.39]It's really old, isn't it?
[56:27.57]But wow, this is the coolest day of my life.
[56:29.22]Okay, time for some official notes.
[56:31.66]This is some kind of Nomai locator.
[56:35.10]You can point out the different planets.
[56:37.30]Which is incredibly cool, by the way.
[56:39.36]But from what little I can understand of the writing here, I think it was built to try to find something specific.
[56:44.38]I'm not sure.
[56:44.86]I also was able to translate something about the south pole of Brittle Hollow.
[56:49.96]So I'll fly there to see if I can learn more.
[56:52.90]South Pole of Brittle Hollow.
[56:54.48]Yep, just gonna get back in the old ship and take off.
[56:56.74]Totally safe.
[56:57.42]Mostly safe.
[56:59.04]Oh, stars above.
[57:03.75]Okay, what's this?
[57:04.93]Pick up scroll.
[57:08.37]What does this do?
[57:09.75]Put it in here?
[57:14.53]Where should this new, more sophisticated locator be built?
[57:17.04]It may need to be larger than this eye signal locator.
[57:22.74]The southern glacier on Brittle Hollow has some available space.
[57:27.10]I could construct a new building to house this proposed locator.
[57:32.14]Yes, let's build there.
[57:32.96]I imagine our young friend Conoy would enjoy that immensely.
[57:36.95]He's always held a great interest in the eyes, especially for a child born so long after the crash.
[57:43.66]I'll begin construction on Brittle Hollow's south pole immediately.
[57:46.72]Okay.
[57:48.84]I know where we're going.
[57:53.66]Anona and those of us originally stranded on the Ember Twin built a quantum moon locator.
[57:59.49]There.
[58:00.59]But the heat of the sun made its construction challenging.
[58:02.67]I wouldn't recommend building on that planet.
[58:07.78]Okay, don't go to the Ember Twin.
[58:09.18]Okay, Brittle Hollow's south pole.
[58:14.41]Is there anymore?
[58:14.95]What's this thing?
[58:18.05]What's that?
[58:18.95]What's this?
[58:19.85]What's this thing?
[58:20.63]What does that do?
[58:24.96]Build the oxygen.
[58:25.60]Alright, if you touch a tree, you get oxygen.
[58:27.28]That makes sense.
[58:27.84]Alright, let's go to the Brittle Hollow.
[58:31.48]Anything else I can do?
[58:32.16]Stand in the middle and scream?
[58:38.98]Alright, you can't get killed by these things.
[58:40.20]That's good.
[58:41.12]Where's my ship?
[59:00.00]Why can I hear somebody playing a flute?
[59:02.24]Alright, let's go.
[59:10.35]Go this way.
[59:15.83]So that's the ruins they were talking about.
[59:17.27]Is there anything else here?
[59:18.17]Alright, don't jump off the edge like a fucking idiot like I did last time.
[59:26.46]Chip is down there.
[59:27.84]I want it to be sunned.
[59:32.90]Alright, bring the sun up here.
[59:39.16]Is that here?
[59:39.80]Or is that... That's on that planet.
[59:44.62]Okay.
[59:45.40]That's on this planet.
[59:52.94]There's no noise or anything on this one.
[59:56.08]Hey, jump to that planet.
[59:57.28]You can make it.
[60:05.60]How much oxygen do I have?
[60:06.60]Plenty.
[60:14.31]Is there anything else to see here?
[60:20.27]I do appreciate that little mini-map over there.
[60:22.19]Because it shows the trail.
[60:25.41]The drunk ant trail that I've made.
[60:27.45]So at least I know where I've been.
[60:29.05]Where's the ship?
[60:36.10]Don't die.
[60:36.54]Don't die.
[60:37.11]Don't die.
[60:37.57]Don't die.
[60:37.87]I'm just free falling right now.
[60:39.13]Don't die.
[60:39.51]Don't die.
[60:39.85]Don't die.
[60:40.45]Don't die.
[60:40.81]Don't die.
[60:41.13]Alright, hold on.
[60:46.93]I don't think these little glaciers... These look really cool.
[60:59.74]What is that?
[61:01.30]Oh, shit.
[61:01.88]Okay, hold on.
[61:02.42]Land on that.
[61:03.96]Oh, and land on the Smash Bros.
[61:05.52]stage.
[61:05.86]Come on!
[61:07.34]I can do it!
[61:13.74]Alright, we're good.
[61:14.50]So what is this?
[61:19.91]Esker's signal scope log.
[61:22.19]Day 48.
[61:22.91]Still not picking up Rybeck's banjo from Brittle Hollow.
[61:26.57]Sure, they're fine.
[61:27.63]But I'll feel better once I can hear their music.
[61:31.24]A week later.
[61:31.66]Today I thought I heard something strange.
[61:32.76]I don't know.
[61:33.08]It was probably nothing.
[61:34.56]No, it's back again today, too.
[61:35.98]Something strange is coming from Timber Hearth.
[61:56.59]Okay, I know this is crazy, but the sound from Timber Hearth sounds exactly like Feldspar's harmonica.
[62:01.15]But Feldspar disappeared in space ages ago.
[62:03.23]It can't be them.
[62:05.67]It's still here.
[62:06.39]This is creepy.
[62:07.01]Maybe my signal scope is broken.
[62:08.29]I better talk to Niece.
[62:23.22]Here it is.
[62:24.10]Right there.
[62:34.22]What is that?
[62:34.56]It's like an asteroid.
[62:36.12]Alright, I want to go there.
[62:40.70]Anything else over here?
[62:47.76]Jesus.
[62:53.62]I'm almost out of oxygen.
[62:54.30]I need a treat.
[62:57.68]Unidentified signal nearby.
[62:58.98]Three minutes of oxygen remaining.
[63:01.38]Unidentified signal nearby.
[63:11.45]Somebody's living up here?
[63:12.17]There's a person I didn't have a space suit on.
[63:13.79]Hey, do you have any oxygen?
[63:16.27]Don't go in the fire.
[63:19.81]Why didn't I have a space suit on?
[63:23.11]You got marshmallows?
[63:23.91]Of course you do.
[63:25.21]Wait, I can't breathe.
[63:26.12]I can't breathe.
[63:26.80]What?
[63:27.98]Why did I take off my suit?
[63:30.32]Oh, marshmallows are so important.
[63:38.36]Wait, I can do this?
[63:46.51]What's the deal with the marshmallows?
[63:47.49]Is there something about this that's important?
[63:49.01]Stop burning them.
[63:54.38]I like them like that.
[63:58.80]Look, I know.
[63:59.72]I know that there's, you know, like a personality test of how you do, how you cook your marshmallows.
[64:05.67]I know.
[64:20.76]Alright, let's talk.
[64:24.71]Oh hey, it's you!
[64:26.25]Ground Control didn't tell me you were launching.
[64:27.95]Long time no see.
[64:29.19]Actually, I guess it's been a long time since I've seen anyone.
[64:35.07]What are you doing up here?
[64:36.11]Haha, very funny.
[64:37.53]Oh, stars above.
[64:38.45]You're serious, aren't you?
[64:39.29]That's just depressing.
[64:41.40]welcome to the lunar outpost which apparently the space program doesn't bother to teach anyone anymore when we first started out of wilds travelers used to bring their ships here all the time for repairs our space-faring technology has improved loads since then but the older ships tend to uh fall apart a lot like more than they do now using the outpost cut down on the number of launches and landings taking place in the village and also the number of fires
[65:09.03]Nowadays, though, it's mostly just me up here raising saplings from timber hearth and keeping an eye on things.
[65:15.09]Don't go.
[65:16.07]I mean, anything else you want?
[65:21.38]Anybody else come by?
[65:22.78]The Lunar Outpost saw more traffic back when our ships were less sophisticated and needed more frequent repairs.
[65:28.56]Nowadays, it's mostly used to keep a set of eyes on things.
[65:32.38]Sometimes Chert comes by to say hi, but Gabbro is Gabbro.
[65:35.77]And you know how Ryvec feels about unnecessary spaceflight.
[65:42.06]Is it even whistling?
[65:44.30]Probably, or actually, definitely.
[65:45.74]The other travelers carry instruments, so they don't bother whistling.
[65:49.76]You can pick up their music with a signal scope, you know.
[65:52.02]Best spot for that is the North Pole.
[65:53.75]Great reception.
[65:55.47]The North Pole is marked in red on your mini-map, but the Attle Rock is a pretty small moon, really.
[65:59.39]Just go north, you can't miss it.
[66:00.43]I already went there.
[66:00.99]Alright, goodbye.
[66:04.81]What do you got, radio?
[66:05.95]What's in your house?
[66:07.47]What's in your house?
[66:08.35]This is where we're gonna find the fucking bodies.
[66:16.39]I'm gonna like put the signal scope down here and you're gonna just... I thought I... No, never mind.
[66:23.52]The sun looks kind of red.
[66:24.60]I mean, the sun is red, isn't it?
[66:27.44]Alright, let's go over here.
[66:38.71]Uh, that's kind of MonkaS, dude.
[66:44.18]I love that emote.
[66:45.02]It just can be used anywhere.
[66:50.01]You can use MonkaS in any scenario.
[66:53.53]And it's just... Alright, we were already here.
[66:56.19]Alright, I'm out of here.
[66:57.53]I'm gonna go to that... Don't go so fucking fast.
[67:02.89]Yeah, I'm out.
[67:07.15]What is this?
[67:07.53]A spaceship.
[67:10.70]A spaceship.
[67:13.58]Wait, what's in here?
[67:17.68]Can I investigate this or something?
[67:20.08]What is this?
[67:31.16]Oh.
[67:32.34]I can't do anything with this.
[67:38.36]Well, I don't know what that is.
[67:41.54]Let's go.
[67:42.56]I can't interact.
[67:43.64]Wait, can I like go in it?
[67:44.44]There's like a hatch or something.
[67:46.48]There's a hole right there.
[67:48.62]Can I go in?
[67:53.95]No.
[67:54.47]Alright, let's just go.
[68:00.33]Back to the ship.
[68:03.92]Is what I'm doing stupid?
[68:05.22]Is what I'm doing stupid?
[68:06.83]Oh, no, no, no.
[68:07.69]Where am I?
[68:08.03]Where am I?
[68:08.67]Where am I?
[68:09.05]Where am I?
[68:10.23]Where am I?
[68:10.55]Where am I?
[68:11.63]Oh, god damn it.
[68:12.63]No, I'm in outer space.
[68:14.35]I'm going to die out here.
[68:15.79]I'm going to die out here.
[68:16.61]I'm going to die out here.
[68:18.67]Get back in the gravity.
[68:20.12]Slow down.
[68:20.56]Slow down.
[68:26.38]Stop.
[68:26.68]Okay.
[68:27.52]All right.
[68:28.62]Let's get in the ship.
[68:36.89]Refill the jetpack and let's go to Brittle.
[68:38.89]Let's go to my log book.
[68:42.73]I think, ooh.
[68:45.41]Holy shit, look at this.
[68:48.20]We have more quests that connect.
[68:52.16]Oh, what?
[68:52.94]Okay, hold on.
[68:56.26]This is where I started.
[68:57.40]Here we are.
[69:00.71]Now my device created pinpoint the source of distant signals the Nomai were disappointed by their failure to detect a signal We can go here right back headed to brittle hollow to investigate something the Nomai were doing at the South Pole or Nomai decided to build a larger more sophisticated eye signal locator on brittle hollow.
[69:18.14]It's the same thing Let's go
[69:29.49]I just monka-essed so hard.
[69:33.79]You good?
[69:34.73]Alright, I gotta put that in my, uh... Brittle Hollow.
[69:38.51]South Pole of Brittle Hollow.
[69:39.82]What's this?
[69:42.66]What planet is this?
[69:45.60]You are here.
[69:46.00]What is this?
[69:46.70]Why is it not listed?
[69:50.46]Brittle Hollow.
[69:51.68]There it is.
[69:52.84]Alright, this planet looks kind of dangerous.
[69:56.13]Alright, let's go.
[70:06.27]Brittle Hollow.
[70:08.04]19 kilometers.
[70:11.08]I probably shouldn't fly near the sun.
[70:12.60]I'm not gonna go near the sun.
[70:16.16]I'm not gonna do that.
[70:17.30]That seems like a bad idea.
[70:24.72]Brittle Hollow.
[70:25.28]Let's go.
[70:25.82]South Pole, Brittle Hollow, right?
[70:32.41]Does this ship run out of gas?
[70:37.69]The ship doesn't run out of gas, right?
[70:42.71]That's good.
[70:49.41]Am I even going towards it?
[70:50.53]Uh... 600 miles a second. 700...
[71:05.60]Is that miles, or is it like millop- millopeters?
[71:09.44]A thousand millopeters a second?
[71:10.84]I don't know what this is.
[71:21.06]Go up, go up, I'm going so fast.
[71:33.23]Alright, let's do that easier.
[71:37.09]That was too many milliliters a second, yeah.
[71:43.70]Okay, coming up.
[71:44.78]Here we go.
[71:45.24]Let's lower this.
[71:48.66]Germ is a super rumor.
[71:50.36]This planet, it's just so small.
[71:52.55]The sun's fucking this whole thing up.
[71:55.29]Autopilot.
[71:56.13]No, I have to be able to do it.
[71:57.93]I'm lined up perfectly.
[72:08.19]here we go well done I'm gonna slow down dodge it dodge it dodge it
[72:40.50]Where is it?
[72:41.71]I have to learn how to do... Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[72:43.89]We're fine, we're fine.
[72:49.31]There we go.
[73:01.58]Get that landing gear up.
[73:10.92]Alright, we're good.
[73:16.14]Yep.
[73:16.68]Alright.
[73:18.20]Looking for the South Pole.
[73:22.08]South Pole.
[73:23.10]Looking for the eye.
[73:25.95]They made an eye.
[73:29.17]Let's go.
[73:35.47]What the hell is that?
[73:39.39]Did I just miss something cool?
[73:40.42]There's like a meteor over here.
[73:59.45]What happened?
[74:03.63]What did I do?
[74:06.81]What did I do?
[74:18.12]Why was it just like an atomic bomb?
[74:25.90]Okay.
[74:29.72]I didn't do anything.
[74:31.10]Am I not supposed to be on that planet?
[74:34.45]Did the game get angry with me because I went on a planet that I wasn't supposed to be on?
[74:38.57]Was that like a gear check?
[74:40.05]Like, wait, you're not supposed to be in this part of the story yet.
[74:42.39]Nuke him.
[74:46.45]Well, all right.
[74:51.05]There's our pilot, ready to get this beauty off the ground.
[74:53.99]You know the ship is a death trap, right?
[74:55.39]You're lucky I'm in a time loop, because otherwise I'd be dead.
[74:58.32]The sun is going to supernova, by the way.
[75:01.52]What?
[75:02.36]You're lucky I'm in a time loop, because otherwise I'd be dead.
[75:06.00]And you're lucky I don't have you grounded for medical reasons, because I have no idea what you're talking about.
[75:09.42]Huh.
[75:17.21]Alright.
[75:24.65]Can I go to that planet?
[75:25.81]Should I try something else?
[75:29.03]I'm going back to that planet right now.
[75:35.00]Hold on, did I get any new info?
[75:35.84]Where's this?
[75:38.86]What's this one?
[75:39.42]Sounds like Feldspar's harmonica, but Feldspar just... We're going...
[75:54.50]Which one?
[75:54.88]I'm gonna try this one again.
[75:56.20]All right, let's go.
[76:01.94]What's this?
[76:03.07]Planetary chart of Outer Wilds.
[76:04.27]Oh, okay.
[76:04.71]That's kind of necessary.
[76:12.03]Buckle up.
[76:15.69]You are here.
[76:16.39]Where's, like, the nuke?
[76:17.84]Okay, is it on this map somewhere?
[76:29.21]Follows lantern.
[76:30.13]That's the thing that exploded.
[76:34.35]Remember I said, whoa, what was that?
[76:35.55]Like a meteor just landed.
[76:36.86]This thing crashes into this planet.
[76:39.72]Let's investigate.
[76:55.05]Just autopilot.
[76:58.90]Alright, I have autopilot on.
[77:03.20]Wow, that's so much easier.
[77:05.11]Why did I not do autopilot ever?
[77:12.49]That couldn't have been more simple.
[77:15.41]Well, I unlocked it, so it's just different.
[77:18.56]Alright, what happened here?
[77:21.40]I unlocked the planet, so I unlocked it for fast travel.
[77:23.48]That's what I'm going to say.
[77:31.91]Okay.
[77:32.61]Let's go.
[77:34.23]South Pole, right?
[77:35.62]Let me go take a- is this gonna happen?
[77:42.24]They so- AH!
[77:43.42]Okay, I- I- I told you, see?
[77:46.04]It's just- Hell is just raining down here.
[77:48.35]I'm just not supposed to be here.
[77:49.73]This is too- I'm here too early.
[77:52.13]I'm here too early.
[77:52.89]I have to get, like, the anti- I have to get, like, the anti- meteor shield or something.
[78:01.93]All right, South Pole.
[78:06.31]Unidentified signal.
[78:07.47]Freeze to... Wait, unidentified signal.
[78:14.54]Uh... God, that sounds like a blue whale.
[78:23.53]Or...
[78:28.54]A car on the highway that's going by really fast that's holding the horn down.
[78:32.95]Alright, it's right there.
[78:48.35]What is it though?
[78:50.66]I'm going up.
[78:59.03]Jetpack.
[78:59.51]Hold the... I want to... Hold... Hold a jetpack booster.
[79:12.22]Why is it doing this?
[79:13.40]Power is sharp.
[79:14.08]Why is it doing this?
[79:18.46]Okay.
[79:18.56]How do you behave in a quantum manner?
[79:19.60]Okay.
[79:50.41]Is that a wandering moon?
[79:57.62]I've also heard the same signal this shard produces, calling out from giants deep.
[80:05.35]Timber Hearth and the Hourglass Twins.
[80:07.33]Suppose there are other shards like this.
[80:15.03]The only other object we've observed displaying this quantum behavior is the Wandering Moon.
[80:20.17]I imagine the moon's behavior in this groves are related.
[80:25.69]In her note from earlier, Felix mentions this strange type of rock isn't found elsewhere on Brittle Hollow.
[80:30.19]What if it isn't originally from this planet?
[80:34.79]Hypothesis.
[80:35.29]This quantum shard is from the Wandering Quantum Moon.
[80:39.53]Perhaps it is even a small piece of the moon itself.
[80:46.97]What is this, Wandering Moon?
[80:51.47]Alright, okay, so... It says to self-pull.
[81:02.24]Don't hit your face!
[81:11.44]Okay, I'm fine.
[81:19.41]Alright, south pole.
[81:21.32]Isn't somebody supposed to be here?
[81:29.04]Watch out.
[81:31.34]Yeah, there's like an observatory here.
[81:34.48]Okay, so wouldn't somebody supposed to be working here that I know?
[81:37.68]Ooh.
[81:38.77]Am I alright?
[81:40.87]I'm okay.
[81:43.61]A ship.
[81:44.79]A ship.
[81:51.13]Oh, damn.
[81:51.57]Alright, there's a way to go down here.
[81:53.65]Whose ship is this?
[81:55.64]Outer Wilds Ventures.
[81:56.52]It looks like it's working.
[81:59.92]Are we already in here?
[82:09.68]I'm here.
[82:09.96]I did it.
[82:10.22]I put the ship down safely.
[82:11.42]Alright.
[82:12.67]Um, and that ship... In that... In that, the ship went down, and I didn't sustain bodily harm.
[82:17.19]A few minor repairs, and it's... Like... Shit.
[82:22.42]I just... I just spilt coffee on my... It's good news.
[82:26.76]The bad news is I haven't found a way inside the structure yet.
[82:28.90]The door is broken and... Ah, hold on.
[82:31.68]I, like, was about to take a sip.
[82:37.51]I jittered... My hand jittered a little and it spilt a tiny bit on my lap.
[82:42.01]Sorry.
[82:44.21]I'm not good at exploring, but I think I would have found a different entrance by now if there was one.
[82:47.71]Probably.
[82:51.62]I can't get inside from here, but I know there are paths below the surface.
[82:54.65]I'm going to head north to the ruins on the equator to try to find a way down.
[82:58.17]Let's open it.
[83:00.33]That didn't work.
[83:11.58]Alright, so... There's a place, there's like a cave to go.
[83:15.48]What is this thing?
[83:18.38]Are we on emote only mode because people are going to give spoilers?
[83:20.86]Yeah, I don't want to be spoiled.
[83:28.29]What is up here?
[83:28.77]Can I go in there?
[83:29.17]You're going to have to communicate in pictures to me.
[83:41.31]Where's that skull?
[83:42.07]I want to see.
[83:43.65]Zoom in.
[83:44.31]Can I get a signal from anything?
[83:56.61]Alright.
[83:58.93]I think I have what I want.
[84:00.44]Put this away.
[84:05.60]I can't get in here anymore.
[84:10.22]What was he talking about when he said... Under the equator is a place to get in.
[84:15.74]I guess I should go over here.
[84:20.70]I got plenty of fuel, right?
[84:21.58]I'm going this way.
[84:35.65]I'm so scared to get hurt.
[84:40.79]Alright, what about, like, right here?
[84:44.25]Oh, oh, oh my god.
[84:45.68]Oh my god, what is this?
[84:48.05]What is this?
[84:48.45]It's a black hole.
[84:49.85]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[84:51.21]Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly.
[84:52.37]Fly?
[84:52.67]Can I fly?
[85:19.55]Grab on.
[85:20.07]Grab onto the edge.
[85:26.49]Come on.
[85:26.83]Grab onto something.
[85:28.91]I can't grab onto this?
[85:31.21]Three minutes of oxygen.
[85:32.03]Come on.
[85:32.27]Grab on.
[85:33.09]Get in.
[85:34.73]Get inside.
[85:35.17]What is this?
[85:35.49]What the hell is that?
[85:37.59]I just opened a fucking ancient sarcophagus.
[85:45.29]Okay.
[85:45.59]I...
[85:51.91]What the hell is this?
[85:53.07]It's gravity.
[85:58.61]Uh... Welcome to the White Hole Station.
[86:04.54]You fell through the black hole by accident.
[86:06.44]Don't worry, you aren't the first.
[86:08.20]This warp tower can return you to Brittle Hollow.
[86:13.50]Every warp tower is turned to a specific astral body.
[86:17.49]To use the tower, stand on the warp platform on the floor and wait until the tower aligns with its corresponding astrobody, in this case, Brittle Hollow.
[86:26.40]If you look up while the station is rotating, you can see the alignment happens when the astrobody is directly overhead.
[86:36.37]What the fuck are you talking about?
[86:48.12]Wait, this is recording.
[86:49.96]Pick up Ember Twin Projection Stone.
[86:52.02]Come on.
[87:00.69]Drop Ember... Oh, that's not... What should I do with this?
[87:13.88]Ember Twin Projection Stone.
[87:17.35]Wait, Ember Twin's a planet.
[87:18.51]Okay.
[87:22.43]I'm gonna bring this with me to Ember Twin.
[87:26.37]Right?
[87:26.57]I'm gonna bring this with me to Ember Twin, and I'm gonna use it there.
[87:30.80]How do I get there?
[87:31.34]Alright.
[87:33.08]I have to wait for Riddle Hollow to...
[87:39.30]Come into frame?
[87:40.14]I don't understand.
[87:43.80]Okay, look up and wait for... Wait, oh, wait, wait.
[87:47.29]When it gets to there, right?
[87:48.39]I just have to wait until it gets to be 12 o'clock, and then I do it.
[87:56.91]Look up.
[88:06.84]This thing doesn't move.
[88:10.36]Alright, I'm going for it.
[88:11.78]Wait!
[88:11.98]I can't see.
[88:17.78]Alright, I'm going in.
[88:20.03]What?
[88:31.38]This is just space again.
[88:38.87]What is going on?
[88:39.89]What am I- What's this doing?
[88:41.15]What should I do with this?
[88:43.53]I just have this ping pong ball.
[88:46.29]What do I do?
[89:06.42]Do I go in here?
[89:08.84]I'm stuck in this thing.
[89:10.04]I don't know what to do.
[89:10.82]I really don't know what to do.
[89:12.60]I don't know what to do.
[89:14.18]I'm confused.
[89:15.92]It said look up.
[89:18.01]And then step into the thing?
[89:19.39]I'm confused.
[89:22.85]I'm confused.
[89:41.36]This did move.
[90:10.87]I don't know what to do.
[90:21.78]This is glass.
[90:22.44]Okay, this is made out of glass.
[90:24.46]Alright, alright, alright.
[90:25.28]It's safe down here.
[90:26.80]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[90:28.32]It's safe down here.
[90:30.18]It's made out of glass.
[90:31.08]I didn't know it was made out of glass.
[90:33.80]Okay, wait.
[90:36.51]It's following me around.
[90:40.46]I did it!
[90:44.17]What did I do?
[90:49.81]What is it doing?
[90:50.55]Where am I going?
[90:56.58]Uh... Where am I going?
[91:02.20]Is this a monorail?
[91:02.96]Do I stay on this?
[91:07.93]There's my ship.
[91:08.33]There's my ship.
[91:08.85]Let's go.
[91:09.21]Go.
[91:09.35]Go.
[91:09.47]Go.
[91:09.75]Go.
[91:09.89]Go.
[91:10.05]Go.
[91:10.23]Go.
[91:12.43]That's my ship.
[91:14.07]I need to get up there now.
[91:15.49]All right.
[91:15.71]Let's go.
[91:17.83]Oh, we're spinning.
[91:18.49]Okay.
[91:18.83]Look up.
[91:20.54]And then when I'm ready, I say stop.
[91:22.90]I... All right.
[91:28.26]Now?
[91:28.86]Go?
[91:29.10]All right.
[91:39.76]Where the f- Well, I don't know where I am.
[91:41.40]Where am I?
[91:41.78]Quick translator?
[91:48.64]Return warp status charged.
[91:49.85]Step onto the warp platform when ready.
[91:55.41]Okay, that's a- So this is a warp platform.
[91:58.99]What do I do with this thing?
[91:59.83]Shit!
[92:02.73]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[92:03.75]Back, back, back, back, back, back.
[92:04.69]Go back, back, back, back, back, back.
[92:06.04]Back, back, back, back.
[92:06.96]Go back in there.
[92:08.39]Go back in there.
[92:09.13]Oh, God.
[92:10.59]Go back in there.
[92:11.33]Ready?
[92:12.45]One, two, three.
[92:18.16]Okay, don't do that again.
[92:19.88]What do I do with this projecting thing?
[92:23.84]Okay, what's down there?
[92:26.12]Oxygen.
[92:27.12]Refuel jetpack.
[92:28.24]I don't mind if I do.
[92:29.70]What is this?
[92:32.30]It's annoying to schlep across the planet to the ship if I can't use my jetpack, so I'm leaving this here.
[92:39.47]I check with my little scout.
[92:41.09]I do too use it, Hornfels, you burnt marshmallow.
[92:46.53]And the scout's integrity reading said this piece of brittle hollow is as stable as any.
[92:50.57]I just, I don't know why I read that.
[92:51.69]I read that like almost like I was reading words out of place.
[92:54.03]But who knows?
[92:55.25]If fuel's still around, feel free to use it.
[92:57.27]I'm not well aware of you reading this.
[92:59.65]I'm sure you, whatever.
[93:04.76]Language.
[93:05.24]Languages.
[93:05.72]Wait.
[93:06.18]Drop.
[93:06.36]What should I do with this?
[93:07.24]There's a language here.
[93:08.88]Hold on.
[93:11.82]The Hanging City.
[93:12.78]Below 50 meters.
[93:14.96]Hanging City.
[93:17.67]Hanging City.
[93:18.69]What is this?
[93:20.41]What planet am I on?
[93:22.65]Alright.
[93:23.81]Let's go.
[93:24.03]I thought it was supposed to be Hanging City.
[93:30.77]Below 50 meters.
[93:31.81]Well, why did you say that?
[93:32.59]There's nothing here.
[93:37.50]There's bones here.
[93:46.61]Hold on.
[93:48.43]Oxygen.
[93:48.69]Alright, there's more things to read.
[93:54.32]What is this?
[93:56.90]To our friends on Brittle Hollow, I just warped here from the White Hole Station.
[94:01.84]Our design worked.
[94:02.70]We've successfully recreated warp travel.
[94:05.73]This is wonderful news.
[94:06.53]I can't wait to see the warp tower.
[94:07.87]It's been a long time since I've jumped through a black hole.
[94:10.57]I don't know how close it is to Anona's original design, but as long as what we built works, then I'm delighted.
[94:17.51]I knew we could do it.
[94:18.81]What are you reading this?
[94:20.85]Wait, this can't be correct.
[94:22.79]Clary, have you seen these readings?
[94:24.54]If they were accurate, they would violate causality.
[94:27.96]There must be an equipment error somewhere.
[94:31.11]I'm returning to the White Hole Station.
[94:32.43]If you en route meet me there, we can run a full diagnostic and hopefully locate the problem.
[94:38.87]Don't tell... Casaba.
[94:43.59]What the fuck do I do with this thing?
[94:47.56]There's got to be a slot I can put this in.
[94:49.22]Right here!
[94:49.48]Alright, put it in!
[94:51.66]I got it!
[94:51.96]Alright, I did it!
[94:52.38]Alright, read!
[94:55.00]What does it read?
[94:55.46]What does it say?
[94:58.60]Rami and I reviewed the records you sent, Poki, and they appear to show Nomai are arriving at the warp receiver on Brittle Hollow slightly before departing from the White Hole Station.
[95:12.47]As I've already told Rami, these measurements can't be accurate.
[95:15.67]How can Nomai arrive on Brittle Hollow before he or she ever stepped into the teleporter?
[95:21.44]The implications are absurd.
[95:24.01]I don't disagree.
[95:24.93]It would mean I've inadvertently broken several fundamental theories regarding this universe.
[95:30.48]We would have to reconsider all of our beliefs about the nature of time.
[95:35.34]Yes, I hope so too.
[95:36.22]Poki, as Pai is confident the reading is inaccurate, she's kindly helping me attempt to recreate this phenomenon at the High Energy Lab.
[95:45.01]We're designing an experiment to take more data.
[95:49.33]An update, Poki.
[95:49.89]The High Energy Lab is in the canyon on Ember Twin's equator.
[95:53.73]Come here at once.
[95:54.49]You need to see this.
[95:57.13]I understand it's exceedingly odd, but Larry and I have tested and retested the equipment.
[96:01.02]The result is the same every time.
[96:02.26]Someone warps.
[96:04.38]The interval is incredibly minuscule.
[96:05.84]Roughly one hundred thousandth of a second.
[96:08.10]Do you suppose our instruments can't accurately measure times to such a small degree?
[96:14.29]We got it.
[96:16.34]iEnergy Lab on Ember Twins Equator.
[96:18.48]Do I take this out?
[96:23.85]What the hell just happened?
[96:29.07]What's going on?
[96:30.77]What's this like magic quicksand?
[96:32.19]Alright, I'm going back.
[96:50.83]What the hell is going on?
[96:58.48]Whoa, wait.
[97:02.44]Was I looking into the future or the past or something?
[97:04.40]What was I just looking at?
[97:05.10]Alright, I'm going to leave that here.
[97:08.54]I want to see that again.
[97:20.64]If I stay in here for too long, am I going to rot my brain or something?
[97:23.16]Alright, that's where I am.
[97:25.70]This must be the other planet.
[97:28.46]Sick, okay.
[97:32.26]Alright, I'm going to leave that there.
[97:33.88]Is there another place to put it?
[97:40.21]I don't think there's another place to put it.
[97:41.75]Okay, cool.
[97:44.79]Let's get some oxygen.
[97:47.03]How do I not have oxygen?
[97:51.64]I read that.
[97:52.70]What's this?
[97:54.12]What about noises?
[97:55.22]There's sounds.
[97:57.24]Hide and seek.
[97:58.38]Outer wilds ventures.
[97:59.52]Quantum fluctuations.
[98:00.81]Outer wild ventures.
[98:01.53]Let's see.
[98:06.47]How's my ship over there?
[98:10.26]What?
[98:20.91]What the hell happened to the ship?
[98:22.09]Why is it over there?
[98:26.32]What the fuck?
[98:30.84]Can I not get off this planet ever?
[98:33.24]How am I gonna get it?
[98:33.86]How am I gonna get over there?
[98:35.38]What is it doing over there?
[98:36.94]I have three minutes of oxygen.
[98:40.42]What happened?
[98:41.36]How did...
[98:50.60]Okay.
[98:52.24]Oh my... Wait, unknown.
[98:53.32]There's a sound over here.
[99:00.64]Pull it back!
[99:02.53]Vitals critical.
[99:03.21]It's okay.
[99:05.21]Why is my ship all the way out here?
[99:06.45]What's something here?
[99:07.41]66 meters down.
[99:09.73]What?
[99:09.93]Where is it?
[99:21.70]This planet's crazy.
[99:24.22]Look at this shit.
[99:24.70]This is crazy.
[99:28.40]Wait.
[99:28.68]Hold on.
[99:29.10]This doesn't... All right.
[99:32.28]This stuff is... Explosions and shit happening.
[99:36.68]I'm going over here.
[99:37.56]Unidentified signal nearby.
[99:39.50]Where?
[99:43.84]Where is it?
[99:47.87]Where is it?
[99:48.17]Where is it?
[99:49.41]Down there.
[99:49.71]It's a guitar.
[99:52.62]What is it?
[99:55.73]What the fuck?
[99:56.77]Okay, where are you?
[99:57.47]What the fuck?
[100:04.59]Wait, no, no, no, not in there.
[100:05.29]Don't go in there.
[100:06.32]Where are you?
[100:07.52]Where the fuck is this person?
[100:08.52]What is that?
[100:09.10]I got nuked again.
[100:29.67]Uh... Alright, that's the second time that's happened.
[100:36.89]It's replaying everything I've looked at.
[100:43.05]Is that... Okay, that's like a time travel thing.
[100:46.85]I get it.
[100:47.35]So I'm... That, we get to see everything I did, but the nuke is like a time explosion.
[100:51.92]Yeah, that has to be what's going on.
[100:57.04]Like, why would it show me literally everything I just did?
[101:01.33]Okay, well, why is that happening, though?
[101:04.25]Ready to get off this ground.
[101:05.17]Hey, what can I do for you?
[101:08.57]I'm gonna time loop.
[101:09.33]Alright, yeah.
[101:11.95]Okay.
[101:12.49]How am I triggering that to happen, though?
[101:14.45]Is it just, like, scripted?
[101:29.68]Okay, let's go back.
[101:32.45]I got a bunch of new info, though.
[101:35.97]I got a ton of new info.
[101:39.13]Quantum Shard.
[101:39.83]This one's like a legendary quest.
[101:45.79]Oh, that's a legendary quest.
[101:47.03]That's just a normal one.
[101:52.38]This is just like a green... This is like legendary, and this is like epic or something?
[101:55.80]I don't know.
[101:58.24]Quantum shards.
[101:59.90]I have rumors about them, but this one's curious to me.
[102:05.75]The North Pole of Brittle Hollow is covered in snow and ice.
[102:07.99]There's a uniquely shaped Nomai ruin on the surface.
[102:10.79]Nomai were able to warp here from the White Hole Station.
[102:13.05]This is where they first recreated warp technology.
[102:16.16]There's more to explore here.
[102:17.44]I don't know, I was about to do it.
[102:18.40]Okay, every... That's a lot of info.
[102:22.96]Every Nomai warp tower is tuned to a specific astral body.
[102:26.84]To use the tower, stand on the warp platform and wait until the tower aligns with its corresponding astral body.
[102:33.17]And then over here, this is the energy lab.
[102:34.53]High energy lab in the canyon at Ember Twins Equator.
[102:36.57]That's where we're going.
[103:01.31]High energy lab.
[103:03.87]Ember Twin.
[103:04.50]Let's go.
[103:08.70]I want to investigate that shit.
[103:10.98]Gear options?
[103:13.36]Jetpack boost mode auto.
[103:15.22]Translator equip mode.
[103:17.36]Freeze time while reading.
[103:18.68]Does that matter?
[103:22.12]Alright.
[103:27.84]I need to... Ember Twin, right?
[103:32.65]You are here.
[103:33.31]Where's Ember Twin?
[103:35.45]Hourglass Twins?
[103:37.39]Ember Twin.
[103:38.17]Okay, I gotta go here.
[103:41.89]Can I... Can I lock on?
[103:53.28]Okay, there we go.
[103:54.40]Hourglass Twins.
[103:55.10]Let's go.
[103:57.14]I'm gonna go to Ember Twin.
[104:07.79]This is pretty cool.
[104:09.21]This is really cool, actually.
[104:13.26]So, alright, I'm starting to understand.
[104:15.28]So you're on this, you just have these little things, these missions you have to do to try to unravel the mystery of the Nomai.
[104:21.56]That's pretty cool.
[104:29.14]And you go quest to quest to quest to quest to quest to quest to quest, and you trail to trail to trail to trail to trail.
[104:35.56]That's pretty fun.
[104:41.53]Error, error.
[104:42.39]Alright.
[104:42.79]How did you... Why is that emote bigger than every other emote?
[104:46.01]What the hell is that?
[104:46.63]That emote is three times bigger than all emotes.
[104:52.93]Alright, we need Ember to win.
[105:00.32]This is slowing down, right?
[105:02.66]Slow down.
[105:07.74]That's the one.
[105:09.86]Slow down, slow down.
[105:10.44]It's going too fast.
[105:16.20]Here we go.
[105:16.54]Slow down!
[105:20.32]So, in the equator... of this planet... Right in the middle.
[105:26.83]There's like a core in this one.
[105:27.93]Alright.
[105:32.85]Go right into like... into like the middle of the cookie.
[105:36.31]Wait, no, don't.
[105:36.95]I gotta land like on this.
[105:37.69]This thing is spinning very fast.
[105:39.17]How am I gonna land on this planet?
[105:41.97]It's going so fast.
[105:46.65]Jesus.
[105:47.19]How am I supposed to do this?
[105:48.85]Okay.
[105:50.19]I'm good.
[105:50.83]Unbuckle.
[105:51.18]Let's go.
[105:51.38]Alright, we're good.
[105:58.40]Flashlight on.
[106:00.64]Now it's the question of getting into the equator.
[106:05.44]And finding the high energy lab.
[106:10.00]Is this the equator?
[106:11.46]There's the lab.
[106:17.36]Lab's, like, right in there.
[106:21.84]But, what's this?
[106:28.97]Wait, maybe... Is this the lab?
[106:35.05]This could be a lab.
[106:38.99]What the fuck is this?
[106:43.33]Uh...
[106:49.33]Alright, fire... now.
[106:54.94]Oh shit.
[106:55.80]Alright, is oxygen in here?
[107:00.24]Ow.
[107:00.90]Old patch suit puncture.
[107:02.46]What do you mean suit puncture?
[107:03.36]Alright, well we got something.
[107:07.95]There's a lot of shit over here.
[107:12.15]Activate the gravity cannon.
[107:15.18]That is a gravity cannon.
[107:16.44]Okay.
[107:16.72]I was making a stupid joke.
[107:19.39]Call the shuttle home.
[107:27.14]The shuttle is currently resting at the comet.
[107:34.18]The sunless city.
[107:47.81]How do I move this?
[107:48.43]Can I move this or something?
[107:53.49]Is it like a punch or a tool I can use?
[107:56.51]Okay, that's what that is.
[108:03.43]I can't get in there.
[108:04.03]I'm gonna go down.
[108:15.41]Just walk into the spikes.
[108:19.45]Imagine my shock when there's a hole in the suit.
[108:25.23]Anything in here?
[108:25.79]Wait.
[108:35.25]No, that's too far away.
[108:39.75]Nothing else here, huh?
[108:40.76]Wait.
[108:41.68]Okay.
[108:42.14]Now I think that's it.
[108:48.77]Yeah, that's it.
[108:49.41]Except, can I do anything with that?
[108:53.13]Oh, yeah, I can.
[108:53.77]Yep.
[108:54.13]Oh, yeah.
[108:54.53]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[108:57.55]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[109:00.33]What does it do?
[109:16.50]What did I just do?
[109:32.29]What's going on?
[109:33.81]Gravity cannon.
[109:39.31]Gravity cannon?
[109:45.34]I don't know what I just did.
[109:50.66]What is this one?
[109:51.90]I think I just sucked something through.
[109:55.32]What is that?
[109:55.99]What did I just do?
[109:57.89]I just sucked something in?
[109:58.95]Alright, put this away.
[110:10.39]Wait, I can go in this.
[110:11.37]What is this?
[110:17.13]It's like somebody's ship.
[110:18.39]This is not the ship!
[110:20.19]Can I fly it?
[110:21.76]Oh, ah!
[110:25.10]Wait.
[110:26.82]I fear our situation may be dire.
[110:31.14]Pi, Pocky, and I landed here on this comet not long after its arrival in Solar Star System.
[110:37.32]Our shuttle's equipment heard strange energy readings coming from somewhere beneath the surface.
[110:43.04]I, Pokey, were able to locate a fissure in the ice in the comet's sunward side, and they descended inside to investigate the source of the readings.
[110:52.38]But I and my sister have been gone for a long time now.
[110:54.86]They haven't contacted me since descending below the surface either.
[110:58.66]Did I leave the shuttle to look for them?
[111:00.70]I want to follow protocol, but are we running?
[111:07.43]I don't know what I'll do if they aren't well.
[111:11.87]Poki, Pi, come back to me safely, my friends.
[111:13.99]Alright, so what does this do?
[111:32.33]How do I stop this?
[111:34.95]How do I stop this?
[111:35.57]How do I stop this?
[111:37.07]How do I stop the ride?
[111:38.67]How do I stop the ride?
[111:39.75]How do I stop the ride?
[111:42.37]No, no, no.
[111:43.15]Go over here.
[111:44.37]Go in the middle.
[111:45.97]What?
[111:46.53]Hi.
[111:50.10]Where the fuck am I?
[111:52.66]Um.
[111:55.94]Huh?
[111:56.78]What does this one do?
[112:02.64]Is this the same place?
[112:07.26]That brings me back to the... Hold on.
[112:11.14]This doesn't do anything.
[112:12.26]What about the middle again?
[112:14.48]Hold on.
[112:15.12]What does this do?
[112:20.70]Go out?
[112:22.02]And then... Where is this taking me?
[112:42.77]That's just lunch?
[112:44.89]But then I just float around.
[112:45.97]What about if I do that one?
[112:48.71]Okay, so what if I hit the right one?
[112:51.73]Where are we going now?
[112:52.27]I don't think I'm... I don't know.
[113:01.27]I don't know.
[113:04.89]Okay, I'm just going to go back.
[113:11.45]Is there more readings?
[113:13.75]Alright, got some info though.
[113:21.04]Alright.
[113:31.47]Quick while the streamer isn't looking.
[113:33.03]Put knives out spoilers in chat.
[113:36.85]What are you talking about?
[113:38.05]You can't even talk.
[113:44.65]You can't even talk, man.
[113:46.67]Alright, so I got some info.
[113:48.47]I'm gonna go back to my... This is not the lab, though.
[113:54.12]We can unmod that guy.
[113:56.42]Yeah, he's a real nuisance, isn't he?
[114:00.08]Alright, I gotta get out.
[114:05.48]Don't touch those.
[114:06.30]What's the best way to get out of here?
[114:18.84]Okay.
[114:20.38]That's not the lab, though.
[114:23.34]It's like in here or something.
[114:24.64]Let's go in here.
[114:25.14]Is it gonna kill me?
[114:29.15]No.
[114:33.89]Mods think they are funny.
[114:35.39]This is turning so fast.
[114:40.95]It's hurting my body.
[114:42.17]Alright, what about up there?
[114:43.98]It said there was a lab in the equator.
[114:48.00]I'm just going to skim the equator and see if I can find it.
[114:55.64]That looks like a lab.
[114:56.92]That looks like it could be a lab.
[114:59.46]And there's sounds coming from somewhere in here.
[115:01.11]All right, here we go.
[115:06.05]Did I find it?
[115:10.15]There's something down here.
[115:11.09]Whoa.
[115:18.78]It's another one of these things.
[115:19.64]It's a cave shard.
[115:24.95]Oh.
[115:25.37]Wait, where'd it go?
[115:25.93]Wait, hey, wait, where is it?
[115:26.81]Where is it?
[115:27.25]It's gone.
[115:27.79]Oh, it's one of those shard things.
[115:28.89]Where'd it go?
[115:35.19]You have to keep looking at it.
[115:36.07]It's like SCP.
[115:38.83]What should I do with it?
[115:39.77]Alright, I gotta read this.
[115:43.53]Friends, if you find any sign of Coleus, I implore you to tell me.
[115:46.55]He vanished without a trace during our research trip and has been missing ever since.
[115:54.03]Molare, some of us from the Sunless City are here to help search for Coleus.
[115:58.42]Can you tell us more about your expedition?
[115:59.90]You have my gratitude, brr.
[116:03.72]Coleus and I were studying the cave's geology.
[116:05.70]We hope to learn more about a unique and wandering rock that visits several different caves in the area.
[116:12.28]Where was young Coleus lost, please?
[116:14.54]He disappeared in the cave at the bottom of the dry lake bed at the North Pole, and it happened in an instant, without warning.
[116:22.71]I turned away from Coleus to examine a sample, and when I turned back, he simply wasn't there anymore.
[116:26.42]Well, he had one in his pocket.
[116:29.28]He had a limited supply of air, I'm afraid for him.
[116:31.64]He had one of those rocks in his pocket.
[116:36.18]Hypothesis.
[116:36.58]We will learn more by examining the northern lakebed cave.
[116:39.58]Macaulay has disappeared.
[116:40.90]Search quickly, everyone.
[116:41.86]We have no time.
[116:45.50]Alright.
[116:47.98]What's wrong?
[116:49.43]What happened to my control?
[116:51.27]What's going on?
[116:51.67]Okay, that was weird.
[116:57.81]Alright, so there's a cave.
[117:00.51]We gotta like...
[117:04.02]There's a lot of shit here.
[117:05.38]Okay, let's go to... Where am I going?
[117:15.35]Wait, what's up here?
[117:15.95]This is where I came in.
[117:17.65]I can go up?
[117:18.17]Okay.
[117:25.11]I don't want to run out of oxygen.
[117:27.81]What is up here?
[117:29.59]There was a sound in here that wasn't that, though.
[117:31.49]What was it?
[117:31.89]What the hell was it?
[117:34.74]No, that is the cave.
[117:35.44]Wait.
[117:36.64]Another one.
[117:43.72]There's like two or three cave shards in here, they said, right?
[117:55.05]Okay.
[117:55.43]Well, we're going there.
[117:57.88]We're just gonna go over there.
[118:01.90]Alright, there's a signal.
[118:05.06]Alright.
[118:08.96]Is somebody up here?
[118:17.19]Alright, there is somebody here.
[118:25.58]This is a Cadbury egg.
[118:29.86]Oh, um, wait.
[118:30.76]Okay, let's talk.
[118:46.57]Chirt.
[118:47.77]Oh, it's you.
[118:48.19]I take it your first launch went well, then.
[118:50.53]Welcome to the Hourglass, twins.
[118:51.77]Mine the sand now.
[118:53.09]What are you doing?
[118:54.69]Cornfell has noticed our star charts are out of date, so I came here to update them.
[118:58.13]But something seems off.
[119:00.83]I've seen, what, 10 supernova by now.
[119:02.83]12?
[119:02.91]They're in double digits now, and that's, you know, not normal.
[119:07.11]Not normal at all.
[119:10.40]Wait, he's seeing the supernovas.
[119:15.64]I found something.
[119:17.54]Why are so many stars supernova?
[119:18.86]What are you doing out here?
[119:19.60]Where should I explore?
[119:20.54]How dangerous is that big column of falling sand?
[119:23.96]I found something.
[119:26.42]Actually, never mind.
[119:27.74]Please do tell.
[119:28.40]What?
[119:30.22]Nothing you'd like to discuss at the moment.
[119:31.48]That's no trouble.
[119:32.10]If you do find something you wish to discuss, please come find me.
[119:34.30]I'll be here studying the stars for a while.
[119:41.28]Why are so many stars going supernova?
[119:43.76]I have no idea.
[119:44.82]Massive stars go supernova when they reach the end of their lifespan.
[119:47.87]It's probably that the stars are older than we realized, or maybe our models are wrong and they don't live as long as we expected.
[119:54.14]Honestly, I'm not fond of either option.
[119:55.55]If our charts are wrong, what else is wrong?
[119:57.19]And our sun.
[119:59.19]No, I shouldn't jump to conclusions.
[120:00.84]I'm probably overlooking something.
[120:02.06]That's it.
[120:02.42]I just need to collect more data.
[120:08.73]Okay, how dangerous is that column's hauling sand?
[120:12.01]On a scale of 1 to dead, I'd give it a 7 or an 8.
[120:14.39]Awfully pretty, though.
[120:15.85]Right now, sand is flowing from ash twin to ember twin.
[120:19.41]But did you know the process eventually reverses?
[120:22.21]We're not completely sure why the sand flows back and forth between the twins, but it seems to be a natural phenomenon.
[120:26.79]Oh, if you'd like to see something interesting, check out the other twin once a little more of its sand drains off.
[120:33.56]I promise you won't be disappointed.
[120:34.66]Is there anything else?
[120:45.08]Where should I go?
[120:45.58]To be honest, I haven't left this lake bed.
[120:49.06]I don't mean to brag, but I'm really quite good with a little scout.
[120:52.38]I've been taking pictures of everything from right here in my campsite.
[120:57.82]Let us free.
[120:58.42]I want to use the Germa auto emote.
[121:02.28]Alright, let them free.
[121:03.10]Let them free.
[121:04.16]Let them free.
[121:04.98]Let them free.
[121:05.50]They've behaved.
[121:07.96]Let them free.
[121:12.02]To be honest, I haven't left this area yet.
[121:13.88]Have you seen the old shipwreck site on the Ember Twin's southern hemisphere?
[121:17.68]The one shooting a bright beam of light into the sky.
[121:20.58]It's not one of our own crashes.
[121:22.06]Surprisingly enough, this is a Nomai ship.
[121:25.13]What ship?
[121:27.13]We find ruins across the Twins.
[121:29.97]But strangely, not a single settlement.
[121:31.31]Believe me, if there was one to see, I'd have it seen with my little scout.
[121:36.23]But they live not on the surface, clearly.
[121:37.59]The Ember Twin is full of cave systems.
[121:39.25]Maybe the answer lies underground.
[121:47.64]What's that?
[121:47.94]What's that?
[121:48.32]What's that?
[121:48.70]What's that?
[121:49.20]What's that?
[121:49.84]What is that?
[121:50.24]What is that?
[121:51.10]What's that?
[121:52.64]What's that?
[122:05.47]What's that?
[122:07.27]It's a bunch of floating trash.
[122:08.87]What do I do about that?
[122:09.61]Alright, hold on.
[122:10.13]What's this?
[122:11.50]God damn it.
[122:12.10]What's this?
[122:12.50]What's that?
[122:13.02]What's this?
[122:13.90]I need that stone.
[122:16.63]I need that stone thing.
[122:23.77]Can I touch this?
[122:29.75]What happens if I go in the middle and look up?
[122:40.20]Um...
[122:41.55]I don't know what that is.
[122:42.09]We're getting close to the sun.
[122:44.20]That's too close.
[122:46.84]That's way too close.
[122:48.76]Who built this?
[122:51.08]I can touch the sun right now.
[122:52.48]How am I not dead?
[122:53.26]Look at how close that is.
[122:56.04]That's so close.
[123:01.98]Oh my god.
[123:02.63]It's gonna touch.
[123:03.17]It's gonna scrape.
[123:03.85]It's gonna scrape.
[123:05.31]It's gonna scrape.
[123:24.40]Wait.
[123:25.56]No, no, no, no, no.
[123:26.22]Don't do that.
[123:26.58]Don't do that.
[123:26.92]That's stupid.
[123:27.38]It said that when the sand's done, look.
[123:29.14]What the fuck happened to my body?
[123:31.08]What's going on?
[123:33.68]What?
[123:35.84]Did somebody throw something at me?
[123:37.24]Did somebody shoot me?
[123:44.25]What happened?
[123:48.69]Well, I found the egg guy.
[123:54.01]He jumped 200 meters into the air.
[123:59.53]This is ADHD problems for me.
[124:05.40]Once there's something to look at, and then something to look at, and then something to look at at the same time.
[124:09.62]And I've just fallen off a cliff.
[124:13.84]What the fuck is that?
[124:16.16]Okay.
[124:16.70]I have new info, though.
[124:22.65]This game is nothing but things to look at.
[124:24.96]I know, and that's why I'm going to have a big problem with this game.
[124:27.48]Because there's too many things to look at.
[124:29.82]Alright, what did I do?
[124:34.20]I got some new info.
[124:42.12]So many info.
[124:44.00]So many info.
[124:45.53]So many new things.
[124:46.43]That's too many things.
[124:51.14]I've got... There's too many DNA strands here.
[124:53.83]I'm gonna go back to this.
[124:55.29]Because this is... There's too much going on over here right now.
[125:03.54]Brittle Hollow's South Pole.
[125:06.20]There's a door to the observatory on the surface, but it's broken.
[125:09.26]And I can... Remember, I could get in there somehow.
[125:21.36]I gotta finish one of these.
[125:24.28]I gotta complete one of these.
[125:25.36]Harmonica music coming from somewhere on Timber Hearth.
[125:29.21]Okay, wait.
[125:30.67]That's this planet.
[125:31.47]That's where I am right now.
[125:41.61]Wait, hold on.
[125:42.89]Who the fuck is that?
[125:57.67]Who's doing that?
[125:58.57]Where is that?
[125:59.05]Did I just get stuck?
[126:37.88]I want to get back up to my ship.
[126:45.86]What's the... Of course it has to be all the way up there.
[126:50.47]Can I fly up there with fuel?
[126:52.25]Or can I only do a big jump?
[126:55.61]I don't know.
[127:00.55]I can?
[127:01.01]How do I do it?
[127:03.35]I'm holding... Right trigger...
[127:07.17]How do I do that?
[127:07.67]I'm just gonna stay on this planet and go find this harmonica.
[127:37.67]Alright, let's go around here.
[127:39.03]Where is this harmonica?
[127:45.21]Who's gonna land right here?
[127:52.30]The world is your oyster, Jeremiah.
[127:54.00]Yeah, let's find this harmonica.
[128:01.92]Okay.
[128:08.83]You're in here?
[128:09.35]Don't fall.
[128:13.68]Float.
[128:26.80]Okay.
[128:31.84]What the fuck is this?
[128:38.49]Um, okay.
[128:40.93]Do you have a harmonica?
[128:47.21]This thing's playing the harmonica?
[128:49.81]How?
[128:55.70]Hey, Hatchling, I thought you were taking that tin can of yours into space today.
[128:58.98]What are you still doing here?
[129:01.21]Me?
[129:01.53]I saw something crash over the horizon and didn't like what I was seeing in the pictures my little scout was sending back.
[129:07.39]But I come over here myself and take a look.
[129:10.58]What is it?
[129:10.94]I don't know what it is.
[129:13.16]It looks like some kind of plant seed.
[129:15.36]But it's not anything I've seen on timber or hearth before.
[129:17.60]And trust me, I was quite the explorer back in the day.
[129:19.68]I think it's extraterrestrial.
[129:22.74]It kind of looks like something that might have come off Dark Bramble.
[129:25.00]Whatever it is, it put down its roots in a hurry.
[129:28.48]I don't like the look of this thing, hatchling, and that's a fact.
[129:31.02]I think I'll set Marl and Hall loose on it.
[129:34.91]Let's get rid of this mess sooner rather than later, and no one can remove an unwanted plant faster than a treekeeper can.
[129:39.77]I'll have to get a look at what's inside the seed first, though.
[129:41.91]I don't want to set anybody up hacking a potentially dangerous plant without a better idea of what's lurking inside of it.
[129:49.07]That's a good way to lose an arm.
[129:50.89]I got one of those.
[129:51.77]Doing a colonoscopy.
[130:27.07]What's that?
[130:32.14]Wait, what is that?
[130:34.50]What is that?
[130:44.27]What is that?
[130:53.41]Go find out.
[130:54.28]I can't go in there.
[131:00.43]help help help me no no stop get off get off get off stop stop stop okay am I gonna die I threw a little scout into the seed you did did you and you're telling me it's bigger on the inside than on the outside hmm it'd be a chore to chop up and no mistake can we even remove a seed that doesn't have the decency to stay the same size maybe I'd better grab an extra axe or three
[131:28.70]See, it did a lot of damage when it crashed.
[131:30.14]I like this crater.
[131:33.17]My signal scope is picking up a harmonica inside.
[131:35.25]I don't know what to tell you.
[131:36.75]The only harmonica player I know is Feldspar, and they disappeared ages ago.
[131:40.45]Listen, don't go telling Nace about the harmonica music, okay?
[131:43.82]They'll never let me get rid of this darn seed they suspected as musical talent.
[131:51.10]Be sure this seed isn't from Timber Hearth.
[131:54.47]Back in my younger days, I explored everywhere there is to go on Timberheart, and saw everything there is to see, and then some.
[132:00.14]Trust me, we don't have anything like this.
[132:02.50]I reckon this thing's from Dark Bramble.
[132:25.61]Wait a minute.
[132:27.55]Wait a minute.
[132:27.95]Wait a minute.
[132:28.45]Wait a minute.
[132:30.74]Wait a minute.
[132:31.22]Wait a minute.
[132:33.38]Wait a minute.
[132:35.72]There's a fire there.
[132:36.58]There's a campfire there.
[132:39.25]Wait a minute.
[132:45.01]Wait.
[132:45.25]Wait.
[132:45.53]Wait a minute.
[132:58.16]Error.
[132:58.46]Duplicate signal.
[133:07.15]Alright.
[133:07.37]Keep that camera on.
[133:09.29]We're going for it, boys and girls.
[133:14.91]I could only fucking learn how to drive my body ship.
[133:18.25]I just want to see.
[133:21.39]I just want to look.
[133:21.91]I just want to see.
[133:25.74]Oh, shit!
[133:26.34]Alright, let's go!
[133:27.38]Let's go, let's go!
[133:28.10]I know where that is!
[133:29.04]I know where that is!
[133:33.17]That's where it is!
[133:35.61]Oh, damn!
[133:36.29]Alright.
[133:36.95]We're gonna go fi- Okay, we're gonna go find that.
[133:39.25]Keep the camera up.
[133:40.83]Keep the camera up.
[133:41.59]Don't put the camera down.
[133:47.42]Oh, you put the camera down, you idiot.
[134:01.77]Wait, it's still on there?
[134:05.39]Fly the fucking ship, Jeremy!
[134:07.46]Oh, wait, let me just turn my head and look around while I drive.
[134:11.58]Duplicate signal.
[134:15.34]Let's go.
[134:17.02]There it is.
[134:20.88]I'm gonna find that guy.
[134:25.25]I'm gonna find that guy.
[134:26.27]That guy's here.
[134:27.01]Feldspar is here.
[134:30.95]He's not lost.
[134:31.77]He's playing the harmonica in a time portal.
[134:34.13]Duplicate signal.
[134:50.86]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[134:57.38]Is this on the Dark Bramble?
[135:01.22]I don't have... I don't have the thing to help.
[135:03.96]It's just... Too fast?
[135:06.66]Am I going too fast?
[135:07.28]Too fast.
[135:09.02]Too fast, pull up.
[135:09.70]Too fast, pull up.
[135:10.36]Too fast, pull up.
[135:11.00]Too fast, pull up.
[135:11.64]All right.
[135:24.47]I'm almost there.
[135:25.11]Just go a little bit closer.
[135:26.87]How am I going to land on this thing?
[135:30.40]Can I just fly in there?
[135:31.25]I don't think I can land on this.
[135:32.65]I can't land on this.
[135:42.19]Once I get close enough, I can stop.
[135:45.34]Oh, shit.
[135:58.09]Okay.
[136:02.37]Okay, hold on.
[136:14.22]Here we go.
[136:14.80]I'm just gonna dump in there.
[136:29.77]Oh!
[136:30.35]Oh!
[136:31.55]Oh!
[137:04.03]I'm coming.
[137:05.15]I'm coming.
[137:08.56]I'll be there in a minute.
[137:09.88]I'm coming.
[137:12.74]I'm coming to rescue you.
[137:13.84]I'm almost out of fuel.
[137:24.03]He's in there.
[137:25.01]Alright, slow down.
[137:37.96]Get in here?
[137:38.52]Alright.
[137:39.58]What is this?
[137:44.07]Error.

[138:20.17]Duplicate signal.
[138:24.85]It's right there.
[138:25.87]Alright, land on it!
[138:28.07]Get it!
[138:28.33]Alright, what is it?
[138:30.97]Grab it!
[138:32.74]Stick a knife in it!
[138:34.02]Stick a knife in it.
[138:35.30]Stick a knife in this thing.
[138:39.86]No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[138:40.86]No, no, no!
[138:43.06]Wait, give me my... Shoot it!
[138:54.50]What?
[139:18.80]What do I do with this thing?
[139:20.58]No, stop, stop, stop.
[139:21.40]Go down, down, down.
[139:22.06]What do I do with this?
[139:22.68]I don't know what to do with this.
[139:26.38]Shoot it in?
[139:26.84]I'm gonna shoot it in.
[139:31.75]Oh.
[139:34.27]No, wait, now where is this going?
[139:37.31]Where is this going now?
[139:39.71]What the hell is this?
[139:42.49]What?
[139:44.63]I'm...
[140:04.38]50 seconds until oxygen's gone.
[140:06.78]But... But... But I'm not ready.
[140:10.86]I'm not done yet.
[140:11.68]I'm not ready.
[140:12.28]I... Am I in somebody's brain?
[140:25.61]Is this, like, neurons or something?
[140:27.91]I'm dead.
[140:35.72]Could I have flown the ship in here?
[140:46.82]I didn't... I didn't know that... Fuck, I don't know what to do about that.
[140:51.08]Do I have any new info?
[141:07.84]What is that?
[141:08.72]That happens every time.
[141:12.80]What is that?
[141:13.30]What's going on over here?
[141:15.96]This shit explodes every time I wake up.
[141:19.20]Why?
[141:19.58]What is that?
[141:25.96]I'm going back there.
[141:26.70]Wait, I need to... I'm going back there.
[141:30.47]No, I need to shoot another thing.
[141:31.95]No, what do I do?
[141:32.55]I don't know.
[141:32.93]Go back to the ship.
[141:42.83]Did I get any new info?
[141:51.25]No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[141:52.31]Did I get any info?
[141:53.79]I did.
[141:55.95]Dark Bramble seed inside the seed.
[142:00.86]When I launch my scout into the seed that crashed on Timberheart, it ends up somewhere in Dark Bramble.
[142:07.10]The seed from Dark Bramble crashed here and has taken root.
[142:15.48]I'm going for it.
[142:15.94]Okay.
[142:16.66]I'm going to do that again.
[142:17.78]And then I'm going to take the ship in there this time and I'm going to continue my investigation.
[142:23.46]Right?
[142:24.04]Yeah.
[142:25.04]Sounds good to me.
[142:25.57]Let's go to the Bramble again.
[142:45.46]I'm rushing.
[142:45.94]I'm rushing.
[142:46.97]I'm rushing.
[143:05.30]Wait, what's this?
[143:06.58]Where's the... Where's the homardica thing?
[143:08.36]Wait.
[143:09.14]I'm like rushing.
[143:09.90]I'm too overexcited.
[143:12.31]What?
[143:15.17]Wait, what the hell is it talking about?
[143:17.47]Why is that 15 million meters away?
[143:19.71]I'm gonna die.
[143:21.57]I'm gonna die.
[143:22.97]No, I'm not.
[143:23.27]I'm fine.
[143:29.70]Okay.
[143:32.84]Shoot it back in here.
[143:33.58]Okay.
[143:42.09]There it goes.
[143:47.66]Wasn't there... It looked like a campfire there, though.
[143:49.84]That's what I don't understand.
[143:50.80]Right here.
[144:00.44]See?
[144:08.21]What?
[144:08.35]There's a campfire.
[144:09.27]Okay.
[144:13.59]Well, I know what that is.
[144:15.05]Let's go.
[144:28.31]I'll get it.
[144:28.68]I'll figure it out.
[144:32.28]Get it.
[144:33.02]I'll get it.
[144:36.34]I'll get it.
[144:36.92]Don't worry.
[144:37.46]I'll get it eventually.
[144:40.71]Don't worry.
[144:41.45]I'll get it eventually.
[144:47.43]Okay.
[144:49.36]I'll get it.
[144:49.72]Don't worry.
[144:50.10]I will get it eventually.
[144:58.42]Play Hulk.
[144:59.32]This game sucks.
[145:04.17]I don't own a Hulk for the Wii.
[145:08.67]How many times do I have to say that?
[145:09.93]I don't own the Hulk.
[145:13.91]What is this?
[145:30.95]Is that my ship?
[145:31.65]No.
[145:34.65]Okay.
[145:36.73]Oh.
[145:36.99]What's going on?
[146:06.72]because it was damaged.
[146:07.68]What, did it explode?
[146:08.53]So what do I do?
[146:09.19]What do I do?
[146:21.23]I'm softlocked?
[146:22.73]Oh.
[146:47.39]Fly into the sun.
[146:49.01]Well, I guess I could.
[146:49.81]Wait, this is going to like... Wait, what's down here?
[146:52.51]Secret!
[146:52.77]Is there a secret in here?
[147:02.22]Okay.
[147:09.98]I'll do it again.
[147:11.44]I just was... I was too excited and I just rushed.
[147:15.77]I was so excited to run down there and shoot my thing.
[147:17.85]Do I need to shoot that thing, though?
[147:20.02]I probably do.
[147:22.18]Do I go?
[147:22.88]No, I don't.
[147:23.48]I know where it is.
[147:25.06]No, I just go there, right?
[147:27.10]Do I need to shoot it in there?
[147:27.95]I don't think I have to do that.
[147:32.53]Maybe I do.
[147:33.21]Alright, I'm gonna.
[147:34.37]I'm gonna.
[147:34.69]I'll shoot it in.
[147:35.13]I'm gonna be careful this time.
[147:38.48]I know where it is now.
[147:39.39]Yeah, I know where it is, but I can't track down my beam thing.
[147:44.79]My launcher.
[147:45.73]This time, nothing to do.
[148:30.72]I'm gonna shoot it through and then I'm gonna try this again where's that where's that thing I wasn't paying attention it's over here right yeah
[149:04.74]Okay, here we go.
[149:06.12]Fire it.
[149:08.28]Boink.
[149:09.88]There it goes.
[149:10.36]Get the pictures.
[149:11.41]Just so I can know.
[149:13.37]What I'm looking for.
[149:19.85]There it is.
[149:24.63]There it is.
[149:31.20]Okay, found it.
[149:32.34]Good, let's go.
[149:35.54]Don't retrieve the thing, duplicate signal.
[149:37.14]Alright, let's move.
[149:46.77]Back over to this ship.
[149:50.29]Why's my ship over there?
[149:53.27]Wait, what happened to my ship?
[149:58.12]Where's my ship?
[150:15.90]Oh, okay.
[150:16.40]Right, right, right.
[150:17.18]I got confused there for a second.
[150:22.16]I forgot.
[150:22.56]Mario Galaxy mechanics.
[150:25.60]It's underneath you, but it's not.
[150:26.96]It's above you.
[150:31.97]Alright, now I'm ready.
[150:33.19]I'm going to go in there with the ship this time.
[150:34.93]I'm going to be very careful.
[150:35.99]I'm going to go for it.
[150:37.81]Let's move.
[150:44.72]Wicked fucking excited right now I'm gonna go fast quick Slow down Seven Six
[151:14.67]Five.
[151:15.73]Slower, slower, slower.
[151:17.56]Okay.
[151:17.88]We're good.
[151:19.78]Can I get in here with this ship?
[151:21.48]It's gonna be impossible.
[151:25.24]I'm not gonna be able to get it in here.
[151:26.40]How the fuck am I gonna do this?
[151:35.75]Look at how small this is.
[151:36.53]This thing's gonna explode.
[151:38.43]This ship's gonna explode when I do this.
[152:06.26]What?
[152:08.34]I lost- I lost signal.
[152:32.21]What's the red thing?
[152:46.82]All right, hold on almost there.
[152:50.24]Did I fly in here?
[152:54.32]Can I make it in there too?
[152:55.46]I don't think I could make it in here.
[152:57.04]Oh my god, how am I gonna get in there?
[153:07.46]Slowly.
[153:08.00]What?
[153:10.10]Hello?
[153:12.60]Hello?
[153:13.10]Hello?
[153:14.58]Hello?
[153:15.68]What?
[153:20.71]What was that?
[153:21.75]What?
[153:49.47]What is that thing?
[153:55.16]Put your... Put your left earphone in.
[154:42.07]Alright, so I gotta go faster than that.
[154:47.46]You have an insta-filter on.
[154:48.98]I do not have an insta-filter on.
[154:51.76]Now you're making me excited.
[154:52.78]I was gonna land the ship in there.
[155:02.59]Why have I not done that yet?
[155:04.45]Why have I not just landed the ship here?
[155:10.12]Right?
[155:10.36]Like, what the hell am I doing?
[155:17.00]I can't kill this guy, right?
[155:48.57]okay so there's a giant uh there's a giant enemy fish in here I have to go quicker I have to go through it faster I don't have any guns so I do I do not have any weapons I don't have any guns or anything that's a little too fast way too fast what excuse me
[156:22.90]Get out.
[156:23.18]No, no, no, no.
[156:26.14]Unbuckle.
[156:26.68]Unbuckle.
[156:27.20]Unbuckle.
[156:27.80]Unbuckle.
[156:28.36]Unbuckle.
[156:29.10]Okay, we're good.
[156:30.00]We're fine.
[156:30.48]God damn it.
[156:31.30]Come on.
[156:52.20]Bad rom- I- somebody... fired like a missile at me.
[156:56.60]It was like an asteroid and it freaked me out.
[156:59.46]Just take off your helmet.
[157:00.55]I don't think I can.
[157:01.41]God, that was a quick one too.
[157:06.27]Whatever, I'm just doing this.
[157:07.27]Just flying in the fucking sun, who cares.
[157:22.68]Shit.
[157:23.46]Oh, that's so... I... I was going too fast because I was too excitable.
[157:31.05]And then the meteor tried to hit me and it freaked me out and I crashed.
[157:34.59]Fuck.
[157:40.13]Can I just die already?
[157:42.24]Can I please die?
[157:45.96]Why can't I just rip my helmet off and have my head explode?
[157:48.96]Why?
[158:16.41]What?
[158:16.87]No, I don't wanna quit.
[158:21.76]How do I burn as much fuel as possible?
[158:46.38]Did I have to leave the ship?
[158:47.58]The ship was spinning around and it was giving me... We're making progress.
[158:57.50]Yeah, we are making progress.
[158:58.44]I wonder if I can float in there.
[159:05.35]Can't wait to watch the replay of this one.
[159:06.97]It's going to be real exciting.
[159:19.93]Three minutes until oxygen depletes.
[159:22.27]What is that?
[159:23.53]Oh, that's where I was trying to go.
[159:26.35]60 seconds.
[159:27.73]5, 4, 3, 2... That's just the noise that I make right when I'm about to do the Bane impression into a coffee mug.
[159:52.80]Exciting.
[159:53.76]Good run.
[159:56.02]Good.
[159:56.46]We did it.
[159:59.22]Oh, look.
[159:59.52]There he goes again.
[160:03.50]My soul leaving my body.
[160:06.52]I don't know.
[160:07.70]Whatever that is.
[160:09.44]Don't fuck it up this time.
[160:10.42]This time I gotta get away from the giant fish.
[160:27.23]Thanks for watching!
[161:03.36]Same deal.
[161:13.95]I'm just a guy.
[161:14.63]I don't have my equipment.
[161:34.21]Go.
[161:40.45]Okay.
[161:41.59]Don't fuck it up this time.
[161:54.40]Accelerating toward destination.
[162:02.31]Ugh.
[162:04.35]Autopilot's cheating.
[162:06.53]Well, Fortnite, Jimmy.
[162:08.52]Let me tell you.
[162:11.70]You have to let Luigi help you sometimes.
[162:13.80]This will be the fourth time I've tried to come over here.
[162:20.17]Hey!
[162:23.67]It almost happened again.
[162:24.69]God damn it.
[162:36.30]Okay, here we go.
[162:42.14]Alright.
[162:42.34]How fast do I have to do this?
[162:43.46]Do I have to go really fast to get away from this?
[162:51.20]I'm scared.
[162:56.33]Alright, here we go.
[162:57.41]I gotta get in there.
[162:58.53]Quickly.
[163:01.53]Put your earbuds in.
[163:02.37]Alright, second earbud going in.
[163:35.80]Alright, now where?
[163:37.06]Oh fuck!
[163:37.76]I'm fine.
[163:38.24]Where am I?
[163:41.72]Straight ahead?
[163:42.20]There's one down here.
[164:01.12]I made it!
[164:01.36]I'm in!
[164:01.68]I'm in!
[164:12.19]Shit's getting louder.
[164:19.15]Wait, it's this thing's mouth!
[164:21.29]It's in this thing's actual mouth!
[164:23.90]It's inside of this thing's mouth!
[164:26.58]Do I go in it?
[164:27.06]Do I get out?
[164:55.16]There is a fire over there.
[164:56.14]I told you there was a fire.
[164:57.44]I told you there was a fire.
[165:00.06]I told you there was a fire.
[165:00.98]I told you.
[165:03.26]I fucking told you there was a fire.
[165:04.64]Nobody believed me.
[165:09.03]Found you.
[165:10.65]Hellspar.
[165:11.13]Oh shit, there goes the ship.
[165:21.01]Can I, can I, what?
[165:27.73]I want to shift to land.
[165:31.11]I need to shift to land.
[165:34.41]Alright, help.
[165:36.37]Help.
[165:37.83]I found you.
[165:39.01]Relax.
[165:40.62]Relax.
[165:42.00]Relax.
[165:44.44]Hey.
[165:46.56]Whoa.
[165:47.70]Where'd you come from?
[165:48.44]No one's coming here.
[165:51.62]Actually, that makes you the second Parthian to ever reach Dark Bramble.
[165:55.57]After me, of course.
[165:56.35]Well done.
[165:58.51]You crashed?
[165:58.93]But you're a good pilot.
[165:59.53]That's kind of passive-aggressive.
[166:00.49]I haven't lived in polite society for a while, so I'm just gonna go ahead and assume that wasn't sarcasm.
[166:26.43]You dodged them all!
[166:46.10]But after a while, I run into this huge angler fish.
[166:49.86]You've seen them.
[166:50.96]Big, gnarly things.
[166:52.17]And this was the biggest one I've seen yet.
[166:54.59]Ever.
[166:55.77]I pull a few stunts, try to shake the thing off.
[166:58.15]Nothing too fancy.
[166:59.01]I'm going full speed when the fish clips me, knocks me into a vine, and...
[167:03.25]Well, like I said, I crash.
[167:04.89]Blammo.
[167:06.14]On impact, my ship starts making noises, like it's coming apart from the inside, and I think, well, that ain't great.
[167:11.58]Sure enough, I barely get out of there before the electrical system starts sparkling like crazy.
[167:17.31]You either move fast or die unpleasantly, so I had to put a little distance between me and my poor friend's ship.
[167:23.88]Wow.
[167:24.02]Yeah, pretty much.
[167:24.48]Anyway, that's how it all went down, hatchlings.
[167:27.61]Story's over, but I feel free to stay and enjoy the fire a while.
[167:31.71]But don't.
[167:31.99]Fire's not going anywhere.
[167:32.81]Anything else you wanted?
[167:53.48]Uh... Shouldn't I tell ground control to come get you?
[167:57.62]Well, yeah, sure, whenever you have time.
[167:59.10]Frankly, I kind of like it out here.
[168:01.06]Quiet, peaceful.
[168:02.48]You're a little young to understand.
[168:03.72]There's a lot of pressure being the best that ever was.
[168:06.36]It'd be nice to have a break.
[168:13.99]Well... I don't think we're going to get out of here, it felt so far.
[168:20.93]What else is in here?
[168:25.58]Oh, oh, oh, oh!
[168:33.24]Oh!
[168:33.58]Okay.
[168:38.76]Okay, come here.
[168:39.70]Okay, I found something.
[168:41.10]Play it on me.
[168:41.52]I found a dark bramble seed on timber hearth.
[168:45.70]That's bad business, hatchling.
[168:47.75]As the turret will tell you, if you so as much glance in dark bramble's direction, there used to be a fifth planet where the bramble is now.
[168:55.35]What are you talking about?
[169:29.11]How's that unknown?
[169:29.73]Can I know what this is?
[169:32.01]Oh yeah, it's mine.
[169:42.44]It's unknown.
[169:43.36]No, it's Feldspar.
[169:44.10]Yeah, I know what that is now.
[169:45.06]What are you talking about?
[169:45.80]Okay, what else?
[169:53.84]Where should I explore here?
[169:54.98]That's the spirit.
[169:55.94]Anywhere is good, but you should know that space is weird here, intensely.
[170:00.42]Ever tried throwing your probe into one of these weird seeds?
[170:02.98]See there, with the little opening, it's just big enough to launch one through.
[170:07.53]The probe tracker will tell you the probe is in two places at once.
[170:11.85]But I don't think that's wrong, exactly, because space doesn't work right in here.
[170:15.73]That seed looks small, see, but inside it's bigger.
[170:19.79]Much bigger.
[170:21.74]Had a lot of time to think about this.
[170:22.86]My theory is space in Dark Bramble kind of expands as you go through each sphere.
[170:28.62]That's why it's bigger inside those seeds.
[170:31.40]Well, that's my theory.
[170:32.22]Keep that in mind while you're exploring Dark Bramble and maybe you won't get lost inside forever.
[170:36.66]Good luck.
[170:40.04]Okay.
[170:42.54]You reached the core of Giant Steve.
[170:43.87]How'd you do that?
[170:45.76]That'll be my old ship.
[170:46.38]Path starts there.
[171:17.73]Hmm.
[171:19.29]Put this guy on emote-only mode.
[171:23.95]What happened to the anglerfish here?
[171:26.27]Oh, the skeleton?
[171:27.07]Gross.
[171:40.76]Skeleton was a good find.
[171:42.14]The light keeps the fish away, you know.
[171:43.78]See?
[171:44.16]They're territorial.
[171:45.62]So they're mostly avoiding each other.
[171:46.96]That's why I set up camp here.
[171:49.27]Oh.
[171:49.97]I want you to look at that.
[171:53.95]Alright.
[171:56.13]Let's go do what he wanted.
[171:57.93]We've got more info.
[171:59.19]Alright, let's go find it.
[172:00.45]Go to the tail end.
[172:01.82]Wait, should I try to get the ship back?
[172:03.14]I should probably do this on the ship.
[172:11.67]Where's the ship?
[172:31.07]Ship.
[172:31.53]Okay, good.
[172:34.03]Alright, he said go down.
[172:45.21]Where the hell is he?
[172:48.65]He's over here.
[172:49.23]Go over to the tail.
[172:55.41]He said it's your journey begins there.
[172:57.58]Alright, give me the scalp back.
[172:58.70]I don't need it anymore.
[173:01.72]Your journey begins here.
[173:03.22]See that flickering light?
[173:06.18]That's where your journey begins.
[173:21.74]Should I do anything?
[173:22.38]What about his ship?
[173:22.98]Should I do anything about his ship?
[173:25.02]Alright, I did it.
[173:30.82]I'm in.
[173:37.73]What?
[173:47.15]Oh!
[173:47.57]Easy.
[173:49.11]Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[173:50.29]Don't be an idiot.
[173:57.12]Don't be an idiot.
[173:58.72]Don't be... Don't be an idiot.
[174:01.12]What?
[174:06.22]This ship doesn't fit in there.
[174:08.37]Wait.
[174:11.95]Did I go the wrong way?
[174:12.63]Easy.
[174:15.03]Don't break anything.
[174:16.95]No, I didn't go the wrong way.
[174:30.80]I'm sorry guys I'm sorry that I'm increasing I'm increasing your puke meters by like 500 right now okay all right I'm just gonna get out
[174:59.67]Oh man, we're going down the drain.
[175:01.23]Is it gravity?
[175:14.82]Duplicate signal?
[175:15.74]Another one?
[175:16.32]Where the hell am I?
[175:18.24]Okay.
[175:30.24]Quantum fluctuation.
[175:32.24]Alright, where am I?
[175:40.00]Where am I?
[175:47.97]What is that?
[175:48.71]Oh, we got some info.
[175:52.55]Hold on.
[175:54.43]Trip 4.
[175:54.99]Entry, I'm gonna say, not 1.
[175:56.61]Crashes, 3.
[175:57.48]Boring crashes, 0.
[175:59.83]Whoa!
[176:00.43]Never thought I'd see one of these beasties outside of the Giant's Deep.
[176:03.30]They were awfully useful back there.
[176:05.08]Maybe a jellyfish could be useful here, too.
[176:08.30]Blur!
[176:08.80]This thing tastes terrible.
[176:10.32]The outside's all rubbery and tough.
[176:11.59]Maybe that's because it insulates the jellyfish's insides from getting zapped by electricity.
[176:17.37]Right.
[176:18.49]I'm going inside of this jellyfish's interior cavity to see if what's in there tastes any better.
[176:35.82]Is this... Can I do that?
[176:37.48]What the fuck?
[176:51.83]Note to Feldspar, do not eat this even if you are dying.
[176:54.85]It would be too sad if this was the last thing you ever ate in this life.
[176:59.79]I guess these jellyfish are only useful for insulation from electricity.
[177:02.80]Again, do not eat...
[177:08.41]Alright.
[177:13.23]Alright, watch the fuel.
[177:17.07]My O2 is going down too.
[177:18.25]Alright, let's keep going around here.
[177:20.04]What else is here?
[177:23.14]Oh, I'm not going to eat it.
[177:28.48]He specifically made a journal to say don't eat this.
[177:34.40]Is that the only thing that's down here?
[177:39.60]Don't go too far.
[177:40.94]Um, is that it?
[177:46.72]That's way too far away.
[177:47.66]Any signals?
[177:48.36]I thought I was over here.
[177:58.41]What the fuck?
[178:11.55]There's too many musical instruments being played.
[178:14.59]This way?
[178:14.99]Where can I go?
[178:15.95]Up?
[178:16.19]Should I go up and out?
[178:17.23]Or in?
[178:17.59]Or around?
[178:18.09]I don't know.
[178:22.19]What's up here?
[178:22.67]Is this where I came from?
[178:26.39]Is there any other way to go?
[178:37.60]Doesn't look like it.
[178:42.16]I don't think there's anywhere else for me to go here.
[178:44.36]We just got to see the jellyfish.
[178:50.06]What about this way?
[178:56.18]Nothing.
[178:57.22]What about behind the jellyfish?
[179:00.90]Nothing.
[179:01.24]What about back here?
[179:02.24]All the way to the end?
[179:04.46]Not here.
[179:04.78]Uh.
[179:08.11]A kind of
[179:29.96]What's down here?
[179:30.50]Oh, this is fucking beautiful.
[179:38.83]What's that?
[179:39.23]I'm alright.
[179:42.35]I'm okay.
[179:42.85]I'm okay.
[179:43.69]I'm okay.
[179:44.13]I just... I just am a little disoriented.
[179:47.98]What's in here?
[179:48.46]Don't.
[179:51.56]I want to go this way.
[179:56.96]Out there.
[179:57.38]That's what I want.
[180:05.46]Go on one of the ends.
[180:07.30]Right up here.
[180:07.70]This is what I want.
[180:11.46]Gotta be something on here, right?
[180:12.66]Like on one of the ends?
[180:14.44]Come on.
[180:16.32]Nothing?
[180:16.64]No way.
[180:20.60]There's gotta be like a node up here.
[180:21.82]Okay.
[180:36.53]Look, this is like these flat surfaces.
[180:38.63]Uh oh.
[180:41.23]Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh.
[180:46.91]Stop.
[180:47.93]How do I go down?
[180:51.66]How do I go down?
[180:58.36]What is this?
[180:58.92]It's trash?
[181:01.64]What is this?
[181:04.52]What the hell is this?
[181:05.14]It's like an eclipse.
[181:06.12]What is this place?
[181:06.86]Is there oxygen on this?
[181:13.51]Holy shit.
[181:16.43]Oh my god.
[181:17.91]Oh.
[181:19.35]Oh.
[181:21.79]Okay.
[181:23.50]Um.
[181:24.94]There's no oxygen on this planet?
[181:26.28]Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.
[181:27.36]Where's the oxygen?
[181:35.09]No, no!
[181:38.93]There's a tree right there.
[181:40.13]I can see the tree.
[181:43.89]What?
[181:47.54]That's like, seriously.
[181:49.76]I can't... Tree?
[181:52.40]Right... No!
[181:54.82]There's a tree right here!
[181:58.92]Tree!
[182:05.12]I got a stone.
[182:15.85]Is there oxygen?
[182:19.79]No!
[182:20.49]No!
[182:21.31]No!
[182:21.91]I thought there was going to be one over here in the corner.
[182:44.96]Well, I made a lot of progress there.
[182:47.08]Let's go take a look at the quest tracker.
[182:59.35]There it is again.
[183:17.04]Quest.
[183:17.48]Quest.
[183:18.00]Quest.
[183:18.44]Quest.
[183:19.28]Quest accepted.
[183:21.12]Quest accepted.
[183:26.91]Got it.
[183:27.39]Now.
[183:28.73]Frozen jellyfish.
[183:30.55]Uh-oh.
[183:30.71]We've reached the dead end.
[183:38.44]Hellspar decided to venture into the jellyfish's interior after tasting the insect.
[183:41.96]Who cares?
[183:53.56]Hurtle Hollow, South Pole.
[183:55.10]There's a door to the observatory on the surface, but it's broken.
[184:03.51]Hold on, let me... Hey.
[184:16.39]Hey, you're leaving to see Adventure.
[184:20.34]How do I... Didn't he say tell everybody?
[184:23.73]Who do I talk to?
[184:24.35]The guy in the observatory?
[184:30.96]And that thing's going to consume the planet.
[184:33.34]Do I need to tell people about it?
[184:35.86]You.
[184:38.12]I got some news.
[184:45.59]Not you, apparently.
[184:48.11]Who do I tell this to?
[184:51.88]Gotta be the guy that Helford or something, whatever his name is, right?
[184:55.68]Alright, I'm going up.
[184:57.20]Gonna go there from here.
[185:15.83]I was holding A. Whatever.
[185:19.30]Good run.
[185:19.76]Okay.
[185:21.30]Okay.
[185:23.77]I'm actually surprised you can die by that.
[185:29.03]Imagine seeing that.
[185:30.49]That guy must have just watched the most heinous, awful, just person being crushed, squished right next to him.
[185:37.95]That person.
[185:39.82]All right.
[185:42.76]Let's go to the observatory.
[185:43.80]We're over here.
[185:45.78]I'm going to make this jump before I'm going to be really upset.
[185:47.76]Okay.
[185:48.60]Okay.
[185:54.08]Unidentified signal?
[185:57.88]Where?
[185:58.18]Alright, we gotta talk to, um... Somebody in here, right?
[186:13.43]Where is he?
[186:15.17]Not even here anymore.
[186:19.52]Where is this guy?
[186:22.34]Well, there's nobody- I can't- I need to tell somebody about the- Maybe I should tell the guy down there?
[186:26.64]Alright, I'm gonna tell the guy that has the mining axe.
[186:34.52]Alright, get me the hell out of here.
[186:37.26]Wait.
[186:40.53]This is wonderful news.
[186:41.37]Thank you.
[186:41.69]Thank you for finding them.
[186:43.45]We were never entirely sure what Feldspar was thinking back then, either.
[187:04.62]So we ought to fish them out of that dreadful place with all haste.
[187:07.40]I'll radio Gossan and have them prepare a ship.
[187:09.32]It really should be Gossan who brings Vel to our home.
[187:12.38]Thank you.
[187:13.86]You can hardly imagine how profoundly happy I am to hear that they're alive and unharmed.
[187:17.06]Um... Where are the other... Currents on Hourglass Twins, Ryback is on Brittle Hollow, and Gabbo is on Giant's Deep.
[187:26.94]All right.
[187:29.30]Yeah, but what about the thing that's taken over the world?
[187:32.64]All right.
[187:35.71]Ow.
[187:38.73]Yeah, yeah, yeah, but... I'm excited.
[187:42.13]Does nobody care about this?
[187:54.48]Um...
[188:11.95]Alright.
[188:12.75]I gotta get back.
[188:13.55]I'm gonna talk to the guy that's looking at me.
[188:18.99]What's that?
[188:22.88]Oh, let me get in there.
[188:24.98]My eye's itching like crazy right now.
[188:27.14]I hope I don't die.
[188:29.56]Okay, we're good.
[188:34.59]Let's go.
[188:38.39]Here I am.
[188:38.59]I really need to go to the bathroom, but I don't want to stop watching.
[188:46.80]You go to twitch.tv slash germa985 on your phone.
[189:04.81]What a sellout.
[189:09.25]Selling out my own stream.
[189:12.11]I gotta go talk to this guy.
[189:14.03]Wait, this is not even... Hold on.
[189:16.09]What the hell is this?
[189:20.32]That looks cool.
[189:20.96]Alright, where's the... I gotta go in here.
[189:29.90]This is not even right.
[189:31.36]Where's the... Okay.
[189:35.00]Where's the guy...
[189:47.22]What is the dude doing the... Where is he?
[189:59.39]Okay, there it is.
[190:00.25]Jesus.
[190:05.75]Oh, inside my ears are itching.
[190:07.35]Ow!
[190:17.22]Alright, you can't, you can't, I need somebody like a designated face scratcher.
[190:24.54]To play this game.
[190:27.96]Hey, listen to me.
[190:32.80]Is that a dark bramble seed?
[190:34.58]It is, yes.
[190:37.02]Don't I have info?
[190:40.98]Well, fuck this place then, nobody cares.
[190:51.40]Alright, what have we got?
[190:52.18]We have some loose ends.
[190:52.84]What is this?
[190:55.22]Giant's Deep.
[190:56.04]Alright, we're going to go to Giant's Deep.
[190:59.62]I've never been there.
[191:13.60]Giant's Deep.
[191:15.88]Set that.
[191:23.20]Oh, there's our Vroomie.
[191:27.05]Autopilot's freaking out right now?
[191:28.41]I'm not entirely sure why.
[191:30.93]Okay, we're good.
[191:38.23]Wait, I have been here.
[191:39.15]Wasn't this the...
[191:52.93]Is this where it just was?
[191:53.73]It is.
[192:06.79]Okay.
[192:10.61]Is there a good place to land this?
[192:11.69]A little landing pad right here?
[192:15.04]That's convenient.
[192:23.03]Hmm, cool.
[192:24.99]Nice.
[192:27.68]Oh, get off.
[192:31.52]Alright, the clue was that he was here somewhere?
[192:41.77]Alright, this place is like super gravity.
[192:56.04]I'm gonna sneeze.
[193:10.77]Ow.
[193:11.95]What?
[193:12.49]No, I wanted to... Is that a jellyfish?
[193:15.95]Ooh, wait, something over here.
[193:27.78]Oh, it's one of those things.
[193:28.56]Alright, cool.
[193:29.10]Let's go.
[193:29.46]How do I swim down?
[193:44.84]Get out of the water.
[193:45.44]This is my greatest fear.
[193:47.48]Can I go in this?
[193:49.24]What happens if I go in here?
[194:09.08]I'm going to go in the tornado.
[194:13.54]See what happens.
[194:23.61]Why can't I swim down here?
[194:26.87]I just keep bobbing out of the water.
[194:28.51]I can't swim down?
[194:29.49]Okay, well, this is getting me nowhere.
[194:46.16]I can barely move in this water.
[195:02.79]Dolphining out of the water like I wire Absolutely All right, well do it to me to do it to me do it to me do to me Wait
[195:32.32]What?
[195:32.66]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[195:38.86]Fuck you, game.
[195:41.76]The gravity was that strong?
[195:43.74]Okay.
[195:51.71]I didn't think it could even hit me.
[195:53.39]I didn't think it looked like it hit me.
[196:07.65]Alright, I'm not getting out of the ship ever again.
[196:09.28]I'm only going to get out of the ship if it's absolutely necessary.
[196:15.00]Let's go.
[196:16.28]Water planet, come on.
[196:18.72]Wink.
[196:56.45]This game looks pretty neat.
[197:00.23]Left trigger goes onto water.
[197:01.35]I was holding left trigger and it didn't do anything.
[197:05.42]Alright, here we go.
[197:06.02]I'm not getting out of this ship.
[197:21.27]Alright, what am I looking for here?
[197:23.39]Something interesting.
[197:24.53]Something weird.
[197:25.58]Something cool.
[197:26.58]Searching.
[197:27.82]Yearning.
[197:28.62]Wanting.
[197:30.88]This looks pretty cool.
[197:31.66]Whatever it is, let's land.
[197:33.78]Oh yeah, secret crystals.
[197:35.56]There's secret crystals over here.
[197:53.47]Where the fuck am I?
[198:03.44]Huh?
[198:06.28]Wait.
[198:06.88]What the fuck just happened?
[198:11.26]What?
[198:11.74]Where?
[198:12.02]Isn't this part of the planet?
[198:15.48]Isn't this part of the planet?
[198:17.96]Alright, I'm confused.
[198:19.58]This is not part of the planet.
[198:23.39]This is the planet.
[198:24.49]I... Alright, I gotta get out.
[198:31.35]Look at this.
[198:31.71]There's, like, something frozen.
[198:32.45]I gotta go in there.
[198:33.15]Can I get out of here, or should I... Hold on.
[198:38.82]Easy.
[198:39.04]I'm fucking in.
[198:40.70]Alright.
[198:41.38]Get out.
[198:41.80]Get out, get out, get out.
[198:42.40]Unbuckle.
[198:44.50]Get out.
[198:44.92]I wanna see.
[198:45.32]I wanna read this. ...
[198:59.36]I thought that- okay.
[199:00.74]I thought this was writing.
[199:02.12]I thought it was writing on the side.
[199:05.04]It's just sticking out.
[199:06.10]How the hell am I gonna get back up here now?
[199:13.91]Ghost matter?
[199:16.05]What is go- wait.
[199:17.37]I remember that.
[199:18.19]We talked about that.
[199:18.83]Ghost matter.
[199:20.77]What's that mean?
[199:31.17]How do I get up this?
[199:42.27]This water sucks.
[199:43.47]I gotta like land in it.
[199:49.96]I wanna see the ghost matter.
[200:01.33]I weigh like 6,000 pounds on this planet, apparently.
[200:04.43]Just get on the surface.
[200:18.50]Too much gravity.
[200:20.70]Okay, I can't get up there.
[200:21.66]I'm going to use my camera.
[200:28.73]Alright.
[200:30.61]I'm gonna shoot my camera over here.
[200:48.56]Oh, damn.
[200:49.85]Alright, I gotta get over there.
[200:51.39]I gotta get over there.
[200:52.11]I gotta get over there.
[200:53.47]But...
[200:55.02]Wait, wait, hey, hold on.
[200:55.70]What is this?
[200:57.96]Threat, freeze.
[200:58.64]Threat detected.
[200:59.66]What?
[201:00.94]Freeze detected.
[201:13.44]Okay.
[201:20.49]What?
[201:20.89]What?
[201:21.55]Threat detected.
[201:22.11]Threat detected.
[201:33.45]Ghost?
[201:38.43]What are you supposed to do about the ghosts?
[201:48.38]There's just ghosts in there.
[201:51.40]Shit, I was going down there.
[201:52.96]Alright, we're going to a new planet.
[201:54.38]I don't like that place.
[201:55.14]I have open mysteries in like three different places.
[202:13.36]negative time interval measured at the white hole station was further investigated the high energy lab in the canyon at ember twins equator or I know my name is mysteriously vanished from a cave at the bottom of the dry lake bed at ember twins north pole and we're going back to amber twin
[202:41.43]I remember hearth.
[202:42.15]There's one on this planet.
[202:43.13]Wait.
[202:43.61]There's one on this planet.
[202:52.12]Let's find it.
[202:55.80]Looking for quantum.
[203:05.25]Quantum fluctuations.
[203:06.29]Oh, crash.
[203:07.63]Don't embarrass me.
[203:14.50]Am I stuck on a tree?
[203:21.35]Wait, it's in the museum.
[203:22.59]Is it the one in the museum?
[203:27.95]Or is it somewhere... Is there another one on the planet?
[203:30.38]No, no, there's another one.
[203:32.60]Where is that?
[203:44.59]It's in the museum, but is it though?
[203:48.57]Is one in the museum?
[203:50.35]Wait a minute.
[203:51.55]Hold up.
[204:01.24]You say museum like an asshole.
[204:04.34]Sorry.
[204:04.74]Sorry.
[204:05.40]Sorry.
[204:05.72]I apologize.
[204:07.36]I am from a different part of the world as you.
[204:15.70]Sorry, excuse me, I have a slight accent from a different part of the world Excuse me, museum Museum Museum, museum, car, museum My room Why do you say room?
[204:40.08]Hey, hey, why does he say room?
[204:44.09]Is it possible that he's from a different part of the world than me?
[204:48.13]How is this possible?
[204:49.65]It's not even... It's not even possible to be from a different part of the world that it's not... Okay, where am I going?
[205:10.07]He's mauling about mouth noises.
[205:17.59]I gotta go to my room.
[205:19.53]The fuck did you say?
[205:20.77]Sorry, my room.
[205:22.77]My room.
[205:23.07]My room.
[205:23.47]My room.
[205:23.85]My room.
[205:26.82]That's an idiot.
[205:33.48]Got it.
[205:35.00]Oh, get the fuck out of here.
[205:36.22]Get the fuck out of here.
[205:37.32]Get the fuck out of here.
[205:38.48]Get the fuck out of here.
[205:39.64]Get the fuck out of here.
[205:40.58]I found it.
[205:58.61]Ghost matter!
[205:59.31]Ghost...
[206:35.41]What am I supposed to do about that?
[206:36.45]Is there more?
[206:48.20]Oh man, there's more.
[206:55.80]Wait, hold on.
[206:56.68]Oh, no.
[206:59.84]Well, I didn't know you could do that.
[207:02.32]Okay, it's right over here.
[207:09.42]Can I, like, collect that shit?
[207:11.47]Or... Is there... Can I walk around it?
[207:16.53]Is there anything to do over there?
[207:18.57]Wait, hold on.
[207:19.59]Is there any reason to be over this way?
[207:24.46]There's, like, nothing over here.
[207:26.32]I don't know.
[207:31.64]I gotta go find that quantum... That quantum beam.
[207:34.22]It's a fun word to say.
[207:37.87]Quantum.
[207:41.40]I would make it a username now, rather than it being like Jerma985.
[207:45.32]Like German... No, no, no.
[207:47.68]It would be... It would be fucking Quantum Conundrum.
[207:53.78]Alright, put this away.
[208:11.13]Where is this thing?
[208:12.19]Down here.
[208:12.95]Alright, let's get back in the... I know I say boat every time, but wait, wait, wait, wait.
[208:17.55]There's too much to see.
[208:18.53]I can't play this game.
[208:20.43]I can't do it.
[208:23.03]I can't do it.
[208:24.46]There's too many things to look at.
[208:25.64]There's too many things to touch and look at.
[208:28.02]I can't play this game.
[208:34.96]It's down here, but...
[208:41.40]I'm gonna just go this way.
[208:42.88]It's down.
[208:44.16]In.
[208:46.46]Inside the earth.
[208:48.40]Let's go this way.
[208:49.06]See if I can find it.
[208:52.80]I can't play this game.
[208:53.80]I'm going home.
[208:54.88]I'm out.
[208:57.26]I'll see you guys in like a month.
[208:58.90]I'm gonna have to play this game for the next six months by myself alone in my room.
[209:03.07]Sorry, my room.
[209:03.57]My room.
[209:03.85]Sorry, my room.
[209:04.39]My room.
[209:04.71]Sorry, my room.
[209:16.80]Alright, it's this way.
[209:23.18]Is there a spot I can go in somewhere over here?
[209:25.46]I see like a little canyon.
[209:28.82]Ooh, there's a little canyon over here, guys.
[209:34.44]Okay, guys, we found a little canyon.
[209:39.86]What's down here?
[209:40.94]Okay, guys, we can go this way.
[209:46.47]Looks like we may have stumbled across something here, guys.
[209:48.79]I don't know.
[209:54.51]Looks like it's in there somewhere.
[210:08.86]Okay, guys.
[210:11.12]Alright, we did something.
[210:21.27]How do I get in there?
[210:27.65]Down in the geyser or something?
[210:38.59]Let's see what's up here.
[210:47.88]There's snow.
[210:54.67]All right.
[210:55.11]All right.
[210:55.43]Okay.
[210:55.61]This is icy.
[210:56.41]Wait.
[211:05.44]Oh, come on.
[211:06.18]I... I... Come on.
[211:08.52]What?
[211:08.86]I was floating.
[211:10.14]I was very... Trying to be very careful.
[211:12.18]Was I really going that fast?
[211:14.99]How fast was I going?
[211:16.01]All right.
[211:20.79]I'm doing a quest.
[211:21.43]Different quest.
[211:27.94]Different quest.
[211:28.38]We're gonna do... I don't know.
[211:48.85]This game is good though.
[211:49.63]I like this game.
[211:51.24]I can see why people like this game.
[211:55.16]It makes sense to me now.
[212:03.11]Okay.
[212:04.67]Quantum fluctuation.
[212:05.97]I'm going to go over here.
[212:07.09]Let's check this side.
[212:21.42]Alright.
[212:21.68]Alright.
[212:22.02]Hold on.
[212:23.08]Unknown.
[212:23.90]Unknown.
[212:24.46]Here it is.
[212:25.88]It's in there.
[212:26.36]Alright.
[212:27.56]Everybody relax.
[212:28.82]Found it.
[212:35.22]Can I land this in here?
[212:46.67]Good.
[212:46.93]Let's go.
[212:52.51]That made me laugh.
[212:58.08]There it is.
[213:04.97]identified grove shard all right now don't look at it okay it changed where did it go it's over here now okay now where is it
[213:34.65]Alright, I'll give you privacy.
[213:38.57]Now, where'd you go?
[213:40.43]Only two places?
[213:41.23]Alright.
[213:45.61]Let's go update this.
[213:50.01]It's that one.
[213:52.73]What about here?
[214:03.50]Remember something?
[214:04.06]Giant's Deep.
[214:04.80]A quantum signal on Giant's Deep.
[214:08.42]Bottom of a dry lake bed at Ember Twin.
[214:11.58]Alright, I gotta get to Giant's Deep.
[214:17.01]Wait, what's down here?
[214:17.69]Alright, we gotta go to that Ember Twins thing.
[214:21.61]Let's go.
[214:33.33]So much shit there.
[214:47.01]Number twins.
[214:52.52]So, what are you guys doing for the Super Bowl?
[214:55.50]Super Bowl coming up.
[214:58.50]Gonna eat some pizza.
[215:00.38]Wings!
[215:01.24]What are you guys doing?
[215:13.79]Alright, let's do it.
[215:14.55]Wait, where are you going?
[215:19.48]Southern Hemisphere.
[215:20.82]That's it right there.
[215:21.52]Where are you going?
[215:22.52]Wait.
[215:25.22]Oh, I was wrong.
[215:25.80]It's over here.
[215:28.52]Who gives a shit?
[215:33.99]I mean, who gives a shit?
[215:36.17]Who gives a shit?
[215:37.15]I don't know.
[215:38.63]Alright, which one should I go on?
[215:46.23]This thing is just going for me every time.
[215:48.95]What is this thing?
[215:50.53]The interloper.
[215:51.25]What the fuck is this thing?
[215:52.43]I want to know what this is.
[215:56.29]No, I don't.
[215:56.91]I'll just focus.
[216:00.75]Where is the... Where did they go?
[216:07.53]The hour... No.
[216:08.33]Where is it?
[216:09.54]Did they go... What?
[216:14.44]The ember...
[216:18.18]Ember Twin.
[216:18.72]Alright, go!
[216:19.72]What just happened?
[216:30.82]Okay.
[216:32.06]We are on our way.
[216:33.72]Wherever it is.
[216:36.77]Where is it?
[216:37.45]I don't even know if I'm up or down.
[216:40.37]I don't know if I'm up or down.
[216:42.11]There we go.
[216:45.37]Ember Twin.
[216:50.14]Ember twin.
[216:51.74]Ember twin.
[216:52.27]Ember twin.
[216:52.79]Not astral.
[216:53.45]Ember twin.
[216:55.53]Ember twin.
[217:05.47]Alright.
[217:05.87]Ember twin.
[217:06.90]Okay.
[217:09.58]Let's land.
[217:15.88]Mm-hmm.
[217:16.82]Slow it down a little.
[217:20.88]I gotta go to the southern hemisphere here.
[217:22.48]It's really fucking fast, man.
[217:28.87]Slow down.
[217:29.95]Slow down.
[217:32.00]Slow down.
[217:46.41]Southern Hemisphere.
[217:47.25]Let's go.
[217:50.39]Get the fucking hype.
[217:53.65]Let's go, guys.
[218:04.29]There?
[218:07.05]Now we're looking for... Cave Shard...
[218:17.28]Okay, this is the southern hemisphere.
[218:24.28]Up there somewhere.
[218:25.12]Guys, why are you not getting hype?
[218:29.14]Come on.
[218:30.02]Fuck.
[218:32.96]Fucking get- I'm gonna get- I'm gonna actually get furious in a minute.
[218:36.48]I'm not seeing enough fucking people in this chat say a ton of talking and shit.
[218:42.12]Like, what the fuck?
[218:45.93]Okay, so here's another when the planets are aligned.
[218:54.62]This planet sometimes, and only sometimes, has a moon.
[218:58.00]It's also of note, it disappears if no one's watching it.
[219:00.82]Isn't that a fascinating orbital characteristic?
[219:05.95]It's my first time encountering a natural satellite with the ability to vanish when not being watched.
[219:11.35]We should study it, or even better, we should travel there.
[219:15.33]I agree.
[219:15.77]Our first step would be determining a method to track this phantom moon so we can always know where it is.
[219:22.76]Given its reluctance to move while consciously observed, it might be a form of macroscopic quantum mechanics.
[219:28.73]Cool.
[219:32.37]Found your note, Mallory.
[219:35.96]Kindly count me among this moon's admirers.
[219:38.49]What is happening when it disappears?
[219:39.87]Does it move to another location?
[219:43.77]I believe so.
[219:44.65]Not only does the moon appear around Brutal Hollow, I can confirm that sometimes it orbits Timber Hearth as well.
[219:49.71]Alright.
[219:54.43]Looks pretty cool, man.
[219:58.15]Alright.
[219:59.75]Alright.
[220:02.21]Freeze detected.
[220:04.93]Ooh, there's a campfire.
[220:17.10]Kurt's research notes.
[220:18.08]Property of Kurt.
[220:19.58]Clearly the Nomai were making astronomical observations here.
[220:22.82]They chose an excellent spot.
[220:24.06]What's this big rotating device for?
[220:28.14]What was it the Nomai were observing?
[220:30.80]I post it.
[220:32.20]There's something special about the orange symbol on that device.
[220:35.96]Al and the new astronaut's translator tool would be nice to handy have right now.
[220:39.85]It would be cool if you had it.
[221:07.73]I need a spot to put this.
[221:28.63]Down there?
[221:28.99]Oh, there's a big beam.
[221:35.83]God damn it, Jerma.
[221:36.58]Why are you still playing this fucking game?
[221:39.52]I thought I was gonna just... Just to make you angry.
[221:44.15]I knew you were gonna be here when you came in.
[221:45.87]And I was like, hold on, shit, everybody quiet.
[221:47.25]I'm gonna make this guy... I'm just only gonna make this guy angry.
[222:05.77]Already holding... Where's the little... Where's the slot?
[222:09.52]There's usually a slot.
[222:14.46]Did I miss it over here?
[222:21.12]There's like an empty triangle I usually can put this in.
[222:27.38]What the fuck is going on?
[222:32.68]Am I missing something here?
[222:34.16]I don't get it.
[222:36.34]Was there a slot I could have put this?
[222:40.56]Wait, what do you... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[222:42.19]This is... Wait, I can take this out and put this in.
[222:48.63]This is the first time I've ever done that.
[222:49.75]I didn't know you could do that.
[222:51.35]I didn't know this had other text on it.
[222:56.37]I thought this was written on this wall.
[223:00.20]I didn't know you could do that.
[223:07.18]quantum moon locator is functioning we have markers for each of the places the moon goes just observe the quantum moon in orbit around dark bramble okay you have keen eyes my friends this moon travels to a different total of five locations remember it was cool to meet you at mcdonald's the other day we didn't do that
[223:34.69]Five locations, not four.
[223:36.75]Added a marker for Dark Bramble.
[223:39.82]I thought the locator now accounted for all the Phantom Moon's locations, but sometimes the locator can't tell where the moon is.
[223:45.58]Perhaps there's a problem with the device.
[223:47.10]It's also possible there exists a sixth place in the star system where the Phantom Moon travels.
[224:06.94]I mean it's fun.
[224:10.33]In line up like this, so where's the one that was the last one?
[224:13.35]How many would you have 123?
[224:14.21]45 You don't have this, right?
[224:20.41]OK, hold on.
[224:25.74]These are always there.
[224:26.58]This one is freaking out.
[224:28.90]These two are always in the case of 123 are always there.
[224:38.31]This one?
[224:38.75]What's this one tracking?
[224:46.23]That's tracking Dark Bramble.
[224:47.53]Alright.
[224:48.05]This is the one that I have to be looking at it.
[224:50.82]There it is.
[224:51.14]Alright.
[224:51.82]I gotta go there.
[224:56.82]I gotta go there.
[225:05.90]Alright, I gotta go there.
[225:11.09]What the hell is that, though?
[225:21.98]Alright, I gotta go there.
[225:29.24]Fuck, how do I...
[225:34.28]Wait.
[225:34.90]No, wait.
[225:36.42]Where'd it go?
[225:44.70]No, where'd it go?
[225:45.30]How should I shoot him?
[225:54.71]Wait, here it goes.
[225:59.55]Ah.
[226:01.33]There it is.
[226:04.56]Okay, it moves.
[226:07.28]Here's what I have to do.
[226:08.87]I've got to get in the ship.
[226:10.91]And I've got to... I've just got to wait for it to orbit somewhere.
[226:19.38]And then go to where it is.
[226:20.80]It should be there for a little while.
[226:24.74]It only appears when you look at it.
[226:32.18]Is it right there?
[226:33.44]No?
[226:34.06]Alright.
[226:34.96]There it is.
[226:39.15]No, wait.
[226:39.69]What is that?
[226:41.09]What is this?
[226:44.63]I had it.
[226:45.59]I had it too.
[226:46.21]I was looking at it.
[226:54.34]I had it too.
[226:54.86]I just don't... It's invisible right now.
[227:04.20]But it's right here.
[227:10.85]You won't be able to get in the ship without it moving.
[227:14.11]I just can't look at it for a second.
[227:17.69]I have to wait until it comes behind me.
[227:20.33]Alright, hold on.
[227:26.29]always orbiting around is it that right now it's orbiting around okay here it goes it's changing to orbit around where are you going okay you back on the hearth where
[227:49.75]Wasn't I looking at it earlier?
[227:51.11]Is it the wrong strategy?
[227:52.17]I don't know.
[227:53.36]Right there.
[227:53.74]Found it.
[227:54.96]Alright, it's right there.
[227:55.56]Alright, so how do I keep looking at this so I keep staying at it?
[228:00.24]It's right there.
[228:00.68]Alright, I know what I'm going to do.
[228:07.64]Alright, here we go.
[228:08.88]I'm going to go to this planet and I'm going to hang out out here until it comes over this way.
[228:13.90]Alright, I'm going to whatever this... I don't know what that planet's called.
[228:18.04]I'm going there.
[228:18.96]Alright, I'm going there.
[228:20.36]I'm going there.
[228:20.74]I'm going there.
[228:21.14]That's where I'm going.
[228:22.06]What's this place called?
[228:26.49]Brittle Hollow.
[228:26.93]I'm going to Brittle Hollow.
[228:36.48]I'm going to go to Brittle Hollow and I'm going to...
[228:42.96]I don't think I can lock it in or anything.
[228:47.55]It's gone.
[228:47.89]Yeah, but it just jumps from planet to planet.
[228:51.19]Unless there's some way I have to keep it in focus or something.
[228:54.39]I don't know.
[228:59.33]I have no goddamn idea.
[229:02.92]I'm going to say that...
[229:12.53]I know what it looks like.
[229:13.53]I'm almost dead.
[229:14.41]I'm going to die.
[229:15.21]I'm going to die.
[229:16.19]I need to go to my ship right now.
[229:34.35]I'm going to go to Brutal Hollow.
[229:35.99]And I'm going to just chill.
[229:36.77]I'm going to wait until it orbits.
[229:41.96]Maybe, let's put this data in here.
[229:46.14]A quantum moon locator.
[229:47.24]Quantum moon.
[229:49.04]Sixth location.
[229:55.33]Normally hypothesized that the quantum moon might be a form of macroscopic quantum mechanics.
[229:59.63]Quantum moon travels to a total of five locations.
[230:01.53]That's not true.
[230:04.26]Quantum moon sometimes disappears possibly to an unknown sixth location.
[230:12.73]disappear when no one was watching.
[230:14.21]I don't know.
[230:25.33]I'm just gonna see if that works.
[230:44.55]I'm just gonna see if it appears.
[230:45.98]Eventually.
[230:46.90]If I just chill.
[230:50.38]Am I... getting too close to the sun?
[230:56.44]Oh, no.
[230:57.78]Oh, no.
[230:58.32]We're go- Okay, we're good.
[231:01.27]Alright.
[231:04.27]Looking for a moon now.
[231:06.09]Slow down.
[231:06.63]Going way too fucking fast.
[231:08.41]Way too fast.
[231:11.19]Alright, I need my... my fluctuations.
[231:15.38]Alright, I'm just gonna... It's right there!
[231:17.36]There it is!
[231:18.74]I found it!
[231:20.81]Why is it so far away?
[231:21.49]No, that's not it.
[231:33.11]That's not it.
[231:38.35]Hold on.
[231:45.13]When is it going to orbit?
[231:45.91]Come on, where is it?
[232:00.91]I need to be looking at it or something.
[232:03.39]Follow this lantern.
[232:13.94]There it is, there it is.
[232:14.98]No, what?
[232:15.56]That's not it?
[232:17.24]Is that it?
[232:20.76]I don't think so.
[232:27.27]Where is... What if... Okay, what if I go... And look at it?
[232:41.78]And then just in the ship look at it and...
[233:00.92]It has to travel to one of these locations.
[233:03.49]It has to.
[233:04.47]It's got to appear here eventually.
[233:33.14]Where is the moon?
[233:34.28]Where is it?
[233:52.83]Hold on.
[233:53.35]Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[233:56.59]All right, I got an idea.
[234:09.67]Good idea.
[234:10.33]My idea didn't work.
[234:42.71]uh... shit wait
[234:58.75]Wait a minute.
[234:59.37]I have an idea.
[235:00.95]Okay, here's my idea.
[235:02.73]Go back on the planet where... Go back on the planet... And listen to this shit.
[235:08.12]Go back on the planet where the things are spinning around.
[235:10.02]You can actually see the thing.
[235:11.38]Take a picture of it when you... What the fuck was that?
[235:27.60]Did I avoid it?
[235:43.55]Okay.
[235:44.47]Get it in the spot that I want it and take a photo of it.
[235:48.13]Keep the photo up and then it'll be there just as long as somebody's looking at it.
[235:53.72]As long as there's a photo of it or something.
[235:55.58]Right?
[235:57.36]I'm gonna try.
[236:03.86]That's what I think I'm gonna do.
[236:08.71]The camera would technically be looking at the moon the whole time.
[236:14.80]Technically.
[236:15.28]I'm gonna try that.
[236:19.38]Let's go.
[236:30.84]He's reading a guide?
[236:32.24]What?
[236:33.65]I'm not reading a guide.
[236:36.67]Why would I do that?
[236:39.83]But shut the fuck up, though, man.
[236:41.45]You're gonna get me in trouble.
[236:44.86]Alright, I know what to do.
[236:52.89]Let's go back to the ember place.
[236:55.07]That's definitely what you have to do.
[236:56.27]Alright, judging by the last weird thing that I had to do.
[237:00.29]Remember when I had to... What did I have to do that was kind of like that before?
[237:09.27]There was something I had to do like that before.
[237:14.80]Ember.
[237:16.24]It was eating marshmallows.
[237:21.25]No, it was different.
[237:21.85]It was something else.
[237:29.79]Game Boomer's Cheating Streamer.
[237:31.55]Alright, that's what I'm going to do.
[237:38.81]Give it a whirl.
[237:52.09]Is that it?
[237:53.75]Is this it?
[237:55.15]Is that it?
[237:56.79]Is this it?
[237:58.29]This is it.
[237:58.99]That's it.
[238:00.01]This is it, right?
[238:01.13]Alright, slow down.
[238:01.65]This is it.
[238:03.22]Is this it?
[238:08.22]Ooh, this is it.
[238:09.38]Alright, I'm on the secret moon.
[238:11.18]I'm on the secret moon.
[238:11.96]Let's go.
[238:13.24]Before it disappears.
[238:13.94]This is it, right?
[238:14.56]Is it?
[238:16.13]Wait, is that it?
[238:19.55]Is that it?
[238:30.54]Wait, that's it.
[238:31.30]It's that one.
[238:31.70]It's that one.
[238:32.18]It's that one.
[238:32.50]It's that one.
[238:32.78]It's that one.
[238:33.08]It's that one.
[238:35.71]No, no, no.
[238:36.37]Don't get out of my sight.
[238:37.05]I have to take a picture of it.
[238:38.53]I have to take a photo of it.
[238:43.03]Okay, right?
[238:44.42]Did I get it?
[238:44.88]Okay, I got a picture of it.
[238:47.56]Okay, I got a photo of it.
[238:48.34]Let's go.
[239:03.15]Alright, now don't put the camera down.
[239:16.64]Okay.
[239:24.51]Where is it?
[239:24.83]Is that it?
[239:27.83]Alright, does this work?
[239:45.49]No, okay, slow down.
[239:47.27]Slow down, slow down.
[239:48.23]Where is it?
[239:48.67]Is that it?
[239:50.99]Where is it?
[239:51.93]I need my... Quantum fluctuations.
[239:58.17]Where is it?
[240:00.36]What's going on?
[240:04.69]I don't know which direction I'm facing.
[240:06.03]Okay, there it is.
[240:12.96]No, that's not it.
[240:13.42]Where is it?
[240:16.20]Is that it?
[240:17.77]No, where is it?
[240:21.01]Wait.
[240:22.45]Hold on.
[240:22.99]Look at the photo.
[241:06.64]I was in a perfect spot.
[241:08.24]I was... Okay, let me try to redo that.
[241:10.48]I'm gonna stay in the ship.
[241:14.60]I'm gonna stay in the ship.
[241:16.22]Because, remember... What are you doing?
[241:26.31]Why is Autopi flying in the fucking sun?
[241:52.03]What a great- good last words.
[241:56.75]I just imagine like three or four people sitting around eating dinner with autopilot on.
[242:01.47]That's the reason why the fucking driverless cars ain't ever gonna work.
[242:07.72]This cabbage is absolutely fantastic, dear.
[242:11.26]Thank you, honey.
[242:11.90]Yeah, but any news?
[242:14.36]Yeah, we actually- Why is my game stuck?
[242:25.16]Oh, daughter of mine.
[242:26.16]How's school?
[242:29.12]It's going great, Dad.
[242:34.41]What do you think about the snake, honey?
[242:37.29]Hmm, it's so good.
[242:39.17]Mom, you're the best.
[242:41.03]Yeah, she sure is.
[242:42.53]What a happy fucking family we have.
[242:46.24]Ah, that's it.
[242:47.24]I'll do the dishes tonight.
[242:48.35]Let me go over here.
[242:50.77]Uh, honey, why is an autopilot flying into the sun?
[242:57.91]Boom.
[243:07.81]God damn it.
[243:09.41]All right, back to where I was.
[243:20.91]It was right here.
[243:22.97]Right?
[243:23.23]And then I'm gonna stay in the shi- Yeah, I freaked out.
[243:27.15]Alright.
[243:27.59]I have a- I can take a picture.
[243:31.99]Wait, is it?
[243:33.05]Hold on, hold on.
[243:33.61]Wait, I'm gonna do the exact same fucking thing I did.
[243:35.63]There's no cabbage in space.
[243:42.39]Oh, please.
[243:45.15]My apologies.
[243:45.91]Alright, don't fucking crash.
[243:49.07]Don't crash.
[243:51.21]Okay.
[243:51.79]I freaked out here because I was like, oh, this is it.
[243:53.41]And then I saw it.
[243:57.86]Where did I see it?
[243:58.42]It was like... Right here somewhere.
[244:01.56]I'm going to wait until I can see it.
[244:11.72]And then I'm going to look.
[244:15.68]Look for it.
[244:16.40]It's going to pour over here eventually.
[244:17.92]Don't break.
[244:25.62]Come on.
[244:27.20]Where is it?
[244:32.17]Where the fuck is it?
[244:32.83]I had it, too.
[244:34.47]I had it.
[244:37.01]I actually had the damn thing.
[244:38.92]It... All right, take a picture of it, quick.
[244:49.78]Slow down.
[244:50.67]Slow down.
[244:51.01]Slow, slow, slow, slow.
[244:51.67]Take a picture of it, quick.
[245:02.20]Now what?
[245:04.78]Can I land on this or something?
[245:05.85]What am I supposed to do?
[245:14.53]What the fuck?
[245:18.26]I'm in.
[245:19.36]I made it.
[245:19.66]I think there's a light signal coming out here.
[245:25.40]Quantum moon.
[245:29.52]I found the quantum moon.
[245:38.79]And there's some fucked up shit going on over here.
[245:42.24]Wait, where'd it go?
[245:44.78]What?
[246:02.19]okay wait was I was I almost about to get squished in the elevator was I actually about to die to that that would have been so embarrassing I would have ended the stream okay turn the lights on okay so uh we have some translation here you have recalled the rule of quantum imaging recall the rule of quantum entanglement
[246:32.87]Call the rule of the sixth location.
[246:45.14]Somebody with a higher pay grade than me is gonna have to come figure this one out.
[246:48.54]I have to move these or something?
[246:53.65]Alright, I remember seeing this image on... Okay, these are just the planets.
[246:59.50]So this is currently set onto the twin embers, right?
[247:05.34]Ember moon, ember planet, and ash planet.
[247:09.32]So why is that on there right now?
[247:12.07]Why is that there?
[247:12.63]These are just... Okay, there's, like, the bramble.
[247:15.89]There's... Whatever that is.
[247:18.49]What locations are these?
[247:19.43]Okay, I don't know.
[247:21.65]Okay.
[247:28.58]I can't move this.
[247:29.40]What does this shit say?
[247:35.99]You've recalled the rule of quantum imaging.
[247:38.13]Alright.
[247:40.63]Quantum entanglement.
[247:43.81]Sixth location.
[247:44.97]I don't know what the sixth location is.
[247:48.62]Let me explore this place a little.
[248:03.65]What's this?
[248:08.99]Wait, that's not mine.
[248:13.22]That's a different ship.
[248:16.58]Whose ship is this?
[248:17.22]That's not my ship.
[248:20.60]What is this?
[248:30.17]I am here after watching it wander the skies for so long.
[248:32.64]I'm about to stand on the Quantum Moon.
[248:38.20]As expected, my shuttle has landed at the Moon's South Pole.
[248:40.98]I will make the remainder of my journey on foot.
[248:44.82]We don't know why the Quantum Moon always welcomes its visitors at the South Pole, just that this is true.
[248:50.06]As a child, I considered such unknowns sinister.
[248:53.24]Now, though, I understand they bear no ill will.
[248:55.26]The universe is and we are.
[248:56.74]I am ready.
[249:08.52]Oh shit.
[249:17.57]What?
[249:22.45]I'm here.
[249:25.15]Where is here?
[249:46.63]Uh... This is that ship from before.
[250:01.48]Um... I don't, uh... I think I might be in trouble here.
[250:10.00]Just jump on a cactus.
[250:24.17]Well, I got a lot of info.
[250:27.54]Alright, can I make it?
[250:36.02]Let's try.
[250:38.82]The ultimate fall joke.
[250:41.83]It's gonna last ten straight minutes.
[250:53.39]Actually, I might get there.
[251:06.69]I'm never... Somebody said I'm never gonna beat this.
[251:10.71]I think I've made pretty good progress so far.
[251:14.68]I found the secret moon.
[251:16.20]I found the Cadbury egg.
[251:27.61]Where is my... What is my ship doing over here?
[251:29.41]Wait, what?
[251:30.79]Wait!
[251:31.75]Wait!
[251:33.65]Why is it floating?
[251:34.87]I thought it was on the moon.
[251:36.11]What?
[251:53.18]See ya, nerd.
[251:54.92]God damn it.
[252:42.77]Just watch the fireworks when the universe ends?
[252:45.23]Now I'm gonna be pretty far away.
[252:51.95]Wait a minute!
[252:54.09]Hold on.
[252:56.61]Wait, what is that photo of?
[253:00.69]How did I get up there?
[253:01.47]I just want to see it one more time!
[253:13.53]No, I just want to see it one more time before I die.
[253:31.00]You're not leading it enough.
[253:32.25]It's too far away.
[254:07.14]What did I... That thing teleported me back to... I pressed the wrong button or something?
[254:11.13]Alright, let me... I gotta go see.
[254:49.30]there it goes whatever it is okay let's go take a look at the data data
[255:09.48]What we got?
[255:10.32]He found the Quantum Moon.
[255:11.64]He found the Quantum Shrine.
[255:12.64]He found the Quantum Shuttle.
[255:14.76]He found the... Gravity Cannon.
[255:22.65]I recalled a Nomai Shuttle from the Quantum Moon.
[255:32.67]Nomai named Solanum landed her shuttle at the Quantum Moon South Pole and prepared to make the rest of the journey on foot.
[255:40.26]Visitors to the Quantum Moon always arrive at the South Pole for reasons unknown.
[255:45.22]The Quantum Moon sometimes disappears possibly to an unknown sixth location.
[255:53.63]Nomai detected a quantum signal coming from somewhere on Giant's Deep.
[256:02.43]Where's the quantum McDonald's?
[256:10.53]That's pretty good.
[256:11.93]Okay.
[256:14.35]I'm gonna go do this.
[256:16.91]This is red for some reason.
[256:18.21]And I glazed over this.
[256:20.07]Ember Twin, Southern Hemisphere.
[256:22.19]Let's go.
[256:22.47]Okay.
[256:31.95]Alright, if you went up this quickly, would your stomach go into your esophagus?
[256:36.68]It probably would.
[256:43.08]Alright, which way?
[256:48.50]This way.
[257:01.60]Your brain would go into your stomach.
[257:07.18]What the fuck, man?
[257:09.11]Why are you doing this to me?
[257:13.09]It's trying to kill me.
[257:15.01]It's trying to kill me.
[257:18.77]Autopilot again.
[257:22.35]Just use autopilot, Germa.
[257:25.09]It's easier.
[257:26.91]It won't magnetize you into the sun.
[257:43.31]What a depressing replay.
[257:49.05]That's the kind of replay where you accidentally recorded on the PS4 for 5 seconds.
[257:54.03]10 seconds, you're like, how the fuck did I do that?
[257:57.60]It's just me sitting at the menu.
[258:09.50]Let's go.
[258:16.51]Don't fuck it up this time, please.
[258:23.88]Autopilot.
[258:25.04]Not yet.
[258:25.90]Wait till I get to a safe place.
[258:32.22]Okay.
[258:33.24]Engaging autopilot.
[258:34.86]No, don't do that.
[258:36.02]Stop.
[258:36.40]Turn it off.
[258:36.76]It's gonna go right in the fucking sun.
[259:00.09]Alright.
[259:04.21]Get on here.
[259:11.46]Land this thing.
[259:14.20]And there's the beacon of light right there.
[259:24.61]Jesus Christ!
[259:31.57]Where am I?
[259:32.51]I thought I did it right.
[259:37.55]I thought I did it right.
[259:39.34]I was going too fast.
[259:44.72]Am I on autopilot?
[259:46.20]Okay.
[259:47.02]I'm good.
[259:57.39]Oh Christ!
[260:02.57]Where's that thing coming from?
[260:03.77]Where's that beacon?
[260:07.97]There's a light beacon.
[260:12.91]Where is it?
[260:24.36]Where is it?
[260:27.56]Where is it?
[260:30.13]There it is.
[260:32.22]Ooh, that's different.
[260:34.38]What's that?
[260:34.78]Ooh, look at that.
[260:40.51]Alright, land.
[260:48.79]Good.
[260:49.41]Get me the hell out of here.
[260:52.86]Ooh.
[260:56.68]Identify signal nearby.
[260:58.56]Frequency.
[261:00.20]Frequency.
[261:03.78]Oh, is it one of these things?
[261:04.84]Escape pod.
[261:07.62]Distress beacon.
[261:08.82]Escape... Escape pod.
[261:13.26]What happened?
[261:26.71]We need status reports for all systems, but initial things first.
[261:29.85]Is everyone unharmed?
[261:31.77]Our escape pod's passengers are afraid.
[261:33.69]They're physically well.
[261:36.15]Inanna, everyone survived the crash.
[261:39.55]This is a relief, at least.
[261:40.69]You have my gratitude.
[261:41.63]Burr, were you able to find the other escape pod's distress signals?
[261:46.08]I can hear both signals somewhere in this star system, but I don't believe either escape pod crashed on the same planet as us.
[261:54.87]What is this?
[262:10.14]Too close to read.
[262:12.52]Launching escape pod three.
[262:15.10]Now launching escape pod two.
[262:20.12]Collision imminent.
[262:20.88]Preparing for impact.
[262:24.08]Scanning external environment.
[262:25.36]Scan complete.
[262:26.28]External temperature is prohibitively high.
[262:30.51]Verdict inhospitable.
[262:32.15]Do not seek shelter on this planet.
[262:35.53]Escape pod 2.
[262:36.55]Vessel has been mortally injured.
[262:38.65]Emergency sequence activated.
[262:40.02]Awaiting departure from vessel.
[262:41.74]Alright, so... Somebody got hurt.
[262:49.16]Alright, somebody got hurt.
[262:52.29]Oh, escape pods...
[262:56.00]The heat from the star system's sun is more bearable below the surface.
[263:01.95]When our escape pod punctured this planet's surface, it broke into what scans show is a cave system with much cooler air.
[263:11.68]I would recommend we seek a site down there to build a long-term shelter.
[263:15.66]I don't know, but these passages are a maze.
[263:23.35]Shit.
[263:23.51]Okay.
[264:00.56]There's a lot of writings down here.
[264:02.00]Alright, put it away.
[264:10.84]What's this?
[264:13.51]Emergency escape hatch.
[264:21.19]We have found an enormous cavern at the end of this passage that appears promising.
[264:24.72]I believe we could construct long-term shelter there.
[264:29.58]Oh, let's read everything.
[265:01.36]Do not follow this tunnel to its end.
[265:05.00]Coleus and I will examine the horror that lies at its terminus later, provided we live through this.
[265:13.46]Don't go down there.
[265:16.44]Keep moving, friends.
[265:17.14]There's nothing of interest at the end of this passage but rocks.
[265:21.04]And while these rocks are interesting, they can wait until a less urgent time.
[265:24.16]Alright, what about over here?
[265:34.97]No, this passage leads to breathable air.
[265:37.43]Refill your supply tank there.
[265:38.87]I cannot tell you how far or deep these tunnels may wind.
[265:42.93]Do not linger as the area is exposed to the heat of this alien sun.
[265:47.75]Alright, let's refill.
[265:59.55]Refill your air supply tank and return quickly.
[266:01.59]Is there anything else out here?
[266:11.56]Alright, that's cool.
[266:24.28]Alright.
[266:28.01]Is there something bad at the end of this tunnel?
[266:31.47]Do I dare do this?
[266:32.11]It said don't do this.
[266:50.20]I don't get it, why?
[267:27.05]well I can't go down here anyways I can't like go through here well okay I'm gonna go down the path
[267:48.65]Let's get oxygen first.
[267:50.35]Which way is oxygen?
[267:51.41]This way, right?
[267:52.24]Which way?
[267:52.56]This way?
[267:52.96]That way?
[267:53.40]This way?
[267:54.04]Where's oxygen?
[267:54.74]Over here?
[267:55.02]This way?
[267:56.38]This way?
[267:56.70]Alright, I'm filling oxygen.
[268:07.61]Let's go down the path and see what we find.
[268:20.31]Let's go.
[268:20.83]Alright, watch out for the sand.
[268:24.97]I have to move quickly because the sand is filling up.
[268:37.91]Alright, there's something.
[268:40.13]Okay.
[268:44.60]Over here?
[268:47.54]Watch out for the sand.
[268:48.38]Alright.
[268:49.62]There's a spot over here.
[268:50.46]Alright, guys.
[268:54.73]I've gotten rings in Dark Souls that were harder than this.
[269:02.35]The path to the shelter site is somewhat convoluted, so follow the instructions ahead closely.
[269:14.54]What?
[269:15.26]I wasn't making a joke.
[269:16.06]I'm just being real.
[269:17.04]Like, I mean, you do this in Dark Souls 2 to get shit, you know?
[269:23.12]Just saying.
[269:25.28]Uh... To reach the shelter site, walk forward until you meet the sandfall at the pit.
[269:37.78]Then turn left.
[269:39.30]Continue to the room filled with rock column formations and climb upward through the opening above them.
[269:44.99]The sand here is rising, so you must be cautious but swift.
[269:51.41]Forward until you meet the sandfall.
[269:53.29]Forward until the pit.
[269:54.59]Turn left.
[269:55.95]Continue the room with rocks.
[269:57.18]Go up.
[269:58.34]Sand pit.
[269:58.92]Left.
[270:08.15]Rocks.
[270:10.29]Pick up rocks.
[270:12.89]Then go up.
[270:15.47]Go up?
[270:16.99]Okay.
[270:21.37]Now what?
[270:25.99]Are there any more instructions?
[270:30.79]Here we go.
[270:35.15]Oh, shit.
[270:35.43]Can I walk on this shit?
[270:36.25]I just jump and...
[271:14.55]Okay.
[271:21.10]Now go behind the sand.
[271:25.42]Can I get back?
[271:25.92]Can I go behind this?
[271:29.24]Can I go behind that?
[271:30.08]Does it go behind the sand?
[271:33.64]Is that gonna hurt me?
[271:34.28]Is that gonna kill me?
[271:35.68]Is it gonna kill me?
[271:38.50]Holy fuck.
[271:39.32]I made it.
[271:39.64]I thought it was gonna kill me.
[271:43.90]You're doing well.
[271:44.40]There's only a little farther left to go now until you reach the shelter site.
[271:47.64]You can rest there.
[271:48.44]Hurry before the sand comes.
[272:02.83]Up there?
[272:03.20]How the hell did they make it up there?
[272:07.44]They built a shitty bridge there?
[272:13.53]Sand's coming. Sand's coming. Sand's coming. Sand's coming. Sand's coming.
[272:28.83]Open the door.
[272:32.09]Up?
[272:37.12]Which way?
[272:38.62]What is this?
[272:42.57]Hold on, wait.
[272:42.99]What about up here?
[272:43.53]This is amazing.
[272:54.92]Look inside the cave.
[272:55.68]How did this come to rest here?
[272:56.88]We haven't encountered others in this cave.
[272:58.72]I think this is a rare find.
[272:59.72]From what we can see, Coleus and I believe this specimen must be very old indeed.
[273:06.37]Imagine what we might learn if we could examine it.
[273:12.81]We both agree it's unlikely this dry planet is this horror's place of origin, especially considering what we observed during the vessel's evacuation.
[273:19.54]Clearly this hole is too small for it to fit through.
[273:23.94]Hypothesis, there's another entrance to this cave.
[273:25.84]If there is, Coleus and I will find it.
[273:28.66]We can't leave valuable information undiscovered.
[273:32.87]I didn't need that info.
[273:34.11]Okay, well.
[273:34.35]Let's go.
[273:34.61]Alright, I don't want to fall anywhere, so I gotta be careful.
[274:04.01]Uh, I can't see shit.
[274:05.45]What about over... Hold on.
[274:08.31]Anglerfish Fossil Overlook.
[274:12.00]Three... What?
[274:12.70]Only three minutes of oxygen.
[274:14.62]Hold on.
[274:17.72]What is this?
[274:20.48]This is... Uh, hold on.
[274:23.80]Should I... Is it the shit over here?
[274:33.20]Oxygen?
[274:34.18]Nope.
[274:38.01]There's shit over here.
[274:38.69]There's stuff over here.
[274:42.71]Um... I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for, but I'm... It's blind.
[274:49.90]I mean, I have tunnel vision right now.
[274:52.20]I'm looking for a flashlight.
[274:53.14]Okay.
[275:03.79]There's something in there.
[275:08.17]How do I get in there?
[275:10.94]Holy fucking shit.
[275:12.68]I've got to get out of here right now.
[275:14.54]How do I get out?
[275:14.98]How do I get out?
[275:16.72]Oh my god.
[275:17.58]Oh my god.
[275:18.40]Oh my god.
[275:20.81]How do I get out of this?
[275:22.27]How do I get out of here?
[275:35.86]What the fuck?
[275:39.54]Hey, so we should build a sun station to the power of this, uh, ash project?
[275:42.88]Are there any ways to generate this level of power?
[275:44.96]Theoretically, yes.
[275:45.53]Paradoxically, no.
[275:46.15]We can't imagine discovering anything like that.
[275:48.07]I understand this proposal is not simple, but the sun station must be built if we hope to complete the Ashwin project.
[275:53.17]I almost can't comprehend this being suggested, sir.
[275:55.35]The purpose of the sun station goes against every standard we hold ourselves to and everything we believe.
[276:00.45]Unsurprisingly, I disagree.
[276:02.54]We're pushing a possible new technology further than ever before.
[276:04.70]That, in my experience, is the defining characteristic of our species.
[276:08.56]If we fail, and the probability of this is insignificant, we will without question destroy ourselves.
[276:13.14]All life here and the rest of the star system, I wish to protect these species.
[276:17.38]The potential annihilation of an entire star system is too severe a cost.
[276:20.47]We shouldn't build the sun station, no matter how badly we want the knowledge that comes with it.
[276:25.38]Fear of failure is a poor reason not to try.
[276:27.29]I believe we're curious.
[276:28.61]The sun station will be work.
[276:30.53]I believe.
[276:32.13]I'm deeply honored.
[276:34.32]I comprehend your position.
[276:35.80]However, if we aren't all but certain, the sun station will not cause destruction.
[276:39.10]Once we build it, then I won't support the station's use.
[276:41.65]But where is it?
[276:56.73]Um... Is there an exit?
[277:00.20]Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[277:03.76]Um...
[277:30.08]I can't... Up through this hole?
[277:32.87]How do I get in the hole?
[277:37.15]Let's jump up.
[277:44.21]Uh... Over here.
[277:54.44]Oh my goodness.
[277:55.64]Open.
[277:56.34]Open the door.
[278:02.15]Gravity cannon.
[278:07.98]There's no time to do any of this stuff.
[278:12.74]Whoa!
[278:28.76]Did I make it?
[278:29.20]I got out.
[278:37.49]Made it.
[278:39.55]Now what?
[278:39.93]Where's my ship?
[278:43.33]Alright, I'm good.
[278:45.03]That was crazy.
[278:48.13]Okay.
[278:50.57]Let me go back and put this data in the ship.
[279:03.93]Yeah, is this thing gonna flood the whole planet?
[279:06.45]There's the beacon again.
[279:12.02]All right, let's put this in.
[279:21.71]Sunless city, anglerfish fossil, sun station.
[279:30.79]You know my debate of building a sun station in order to power the Ash Twin project.
[279:45.98]Canyon at Ember Twin's equator.
[279:56.30]Canyon at Ember Twin's equator.
[280:05.74]no what are you doing well it's full of sand now so I don't think I can do much I don't think I can do anything else here it's getting close
[280:39.72]that thing's dumping the sand that's the other right okay so I have to go to turn that sand off somehow it's taking over the whole planet
[281:14.53]Let me look at it.
[281:15.07]Where is he?
[281:17.41]Is that going to keep going?
[281:33.78]Yeah, yeah.
[281:34.98]I'm dead.
[281:37.25]Yeah, I'm dead.
[281:37.75]I'm just dead.
[281:38.87]Alright, now for the next time I notice this sound.
[281:40.63]I'm going to go to the... Yeah, I'm just going to bump my head a bunch more times.
[281:43.11]I'll be fine.
[281:47.13]Yeah, I mean, three minutes remaining.
[281:48.87]Actually, I might be able to get there.
[281:50.19]I wonder if there's a lot of that planet.
[282:01.23]Can I land on this?
[282:18.44]I wonder if I can actually get on her.
[282:26.00]Oh, put the seatbelt on.
[282:27.18]I haven't even looked at this yet.
[282:34.38]Okay, I remember this.
[282:42.60]I'm going in here.
[282:56.05]All right, I'm on here.
[283:00.07]This is huge.
[283:02.70]All right.
[283:08.96]What's the purpose of this?
[283:15.62]Huh.
[283:15.92]Okay.
[283:28.69]What's that?
[284:00.34]Sun hungers I think we're dead What's the significance of this place?
[284:28.90]Bye, everybody.
[284:37.14]Got it!
[284:51.66]It's an Unreal Tournament map.
[285:11.04]So it's safe to say he knows about the supernova now.
[285:15.09]Yeah.
[285:15.51]Yeah, I'd say that's a pretty safe assessment.
[285:27.33]There it goes again.
[285:30.85]I kind of want to investigate what that is.
[285:36.32]You know what I mean?
[285:37.46]I want to go just... I want to go up there.
[285:39.23]That thing... I'm going up there.
[285:40.27]I want to know what that is.
[285:49.09]This thing keeps exploding every time I die.
[285:52.89]Why?
[285:55.56]What's the point?
[286:03.42]Well, this is unknown.
[286:11.60]What's this unknown signal?
[286:15.83]Slow down.
[286:22.66]Is it the ship itself doing that?
[286:25.96]No, it's something on that planet.
[286:27.00]But I still want to know what this is.
[286:50.11]I'm going to hit the surface of this planet.
[286:56.44]Something in there.
[286:56.94]All right, something in there.
[287:03.81]It's going too fast.
[287:14.39]All right, can I get in there closer?
[287:21.22]Where did it go?
[287:23.70]Where is it?
[287:31.11]What the fuck?
[287:33.71]What?
[287:34.07]What is going on?
[287:36.85]Are we getting sucked into the gravity?
[287:42.37]Okay.
[287:45.31]Get over here.
[287:45.73]Alright, there it is.
[287:49.18]Land on it.
[287:54.18]Land on it?
[288:02.66]I landed.
[288:04.33]Did I?
[288:09.37]What's wrong?
[288:13.99]What happened?
[288:14.79]What?!
[288:15.01]Uh, how did I- Nice.
[288:23.80]I didn't put a suit on, I... Yeah, whatever.
[288:33.48]It took me so fucking long to get there, too.
[288:37.17]Well, look, it happened again.
[288:38.33]I thought you were making that choking sound.
[288:46.14]I thought there was something in that hole.
[288:49.06]Making that choking sound.
[288:57.01]Alright, where is it?
[289:09.06]How come I can't see it now?
[289:14.41]Is it behind the moon thing?
[289:15.61]Whatever this is.
[289:17.37]There you go.
[289:27.95]Mm-hmm.
[289:28.29]Come here.
[289:33.45]I'm gonna screw it up this time.
[289:45.08]Okay.
[289:55.37]All right.
[290:03.10]Let's check this place out.
[290:04.74]God fucking damn it.
[290:28.87]My microphone's been delayed by 650 milliseconds the whole stream because we played Xbox 360 yesterday.
[290:52.50]You knew from the start?
[290:57.66]Let's do the whole stream again.
[290:59.28]God, I hate when that shit happens.
[291:01.16]Because capturing the 360, you have to delay your voice because it takes like almost a full second for the capture card to pull it into OBS.
[291:11.45]God damn it.
[291:15.82]Well, I found this.
[291:23.92]Wasn't that noticeable?
[291:29.09]Well, it was definitely noticeable when I was just being missed by asteroids and screaming almost a full second later.
[291:37.54]Here comes the asteroid!
[291:38.68]Oh, it just passed.
[291:40.80]Oh!
[291:46.88]Probe tracking module?
[291:49.75]I thought you were just slow.
[291:51.09]Like my brain.
[291:54.73]Sorry, guys.
[291:55.77]Oh, that was scary.
[291:57.91]Oh!
[291:59.67]Shit.
[292:02.07]Control module.
[292:02.91]Oh well.
[292:12.48]Launch module.
[292:13.32]What is this thing?
[292:17.61]Fucking pea brain.
[292:24.39]Shattered through the glass.
[292:29.86]Alright, what should I go into?
[292:30.82]I'm gonna go over here.
[292:43.12]Alright, so this is... Am I gonna put this thing back together?
[292:54.12]Let's...
[292:59.71]Cool.
[293:00.89]Wait.
[293:29.66]I don't get it.
[293:38.57]I don't get it.
[293:48.41]This is different.
[293:49.03]I have bad news, Havens.
[293:51.81]Yaros says there was a problem with the proposed power source.
[293:56.14]So the orbital probe cannon won't be asked to fire.
[294:03.60]I hope you're pulling my locomotive limb here, Cassava.
[294:09.74]I wish I were, my friend, but no, they aren't certain they can fix the problem, so the orbitable probe cannon is on indefinite hiatus.
[294:18.23]Tell Privet and Mallow they should return from the cannon.
[294:25.06]My spouse and I will remain at the construction yard for now.
[294:31.41]An update.
[294:31.87]Mallow and I will join you in Daz.
[294:34.26]Privet left to visit her brother.
[294:35.34]She fears Ideia may feel responsible.
[294:41.50]Construction yard?
[294:42.68]What about this one?
[294:47.32]Does this one do anything for us?
[295:08.00]Can I read that?
[295:14.88]No.
[295:15.60]Okay, well, we got some info.
[295:26.07]I guess we got some info.
[295:28.97]Okay, info.
[295:30.11]Got it.
[295:31.17]It's been around back to where we were.
[295:36.42]This can go all the way... I guess I'm going to put the marble through.
[295:40.50]To go down?
[295:47.43]What is that?
[295:47.91]Uh... That's a... A device of some sort.
[295:54.67]I don't think...
[296:01.36]Let's do the other one.
[296:01.90]So that's the cannon.
[296:33.11]Any more knowledge?
[296:37.33]Broke apart, as it didn't work.
[296:41.57]Begin launch log.
[296:42.75]Orbital probe cannon.
[296:44.57]Launch request received.
[296:45.93]Probe launch successful.
[296:50.71]Probe tracking module is receiving data from probe.
[296:54.88]Orbital probe cannon structure compromised during launch.
[296:57.64]Damage to multiple modules detected.
[297:03.80]Uh huh.
[297:22.37]Orbital probe can't damage report.
[297:23.73]Severe structural stress detected.
[297:25.33]Accessing damage to modules.
[297:27.87]Control module intact.
[297:30.53]No structural damage.
[297:32.39]Launch module.
[297:33.07]Viewport window fractured.
[297:34.39]Module exposed to vacuum of space.
[297:37.73]Probe tracking module missing.
[297:42.61]So wait.
[297:44.83]This thing explodes every time I wake up.
[297:47.56]And something shoots out of it.
[297:51.12]Maybe I should follow that thing.
[297:52.28]Should I just try to chase that thing down?
[298:00.37]What just happened?
[298:00.95]What?
[298:20.44]Wait, what about this one?
[298:21.20]Sava tells me he and the construction yard crew have determined a power setting we are not under any circumstances to go above.
[298:49.11]I see.
[298:50.11]And am I right to think that, consequently, we'll be ignoring that setting?
[298:54.00]What, are you fucking stupid?
[298:56.34]I can posit, with nearly 100% certainty, our friends have accounted for our natures, so I suggest we do.
[299:02.36]Giving the Orbital Probe Cannon all the power it can structurally withstand creates the greatest chance of finding the Eye of the Universe.
[299:12.81]Yes.
[299:13.63]The probe must travel as fast as it can.
[299:16.17]As far as it can.
[299:17.33]I'll make some adjustments.
[299:21.64]The thought of concluding our elders' curious and challenging search increases my heart's temperature.
[299:26.50]My love.
[299:27.10]They're trying to find the center of the universe.
[299:34.61]They found it.
[299:35.15]They went too deep.
[299:36.39]Caused a fucking time paradox.
[299:38.21]And now I have to fix that.
[299:39.15]I have to be the one that fucking closes the time loop.
[299:42.27]Because they screwed it all up.
[299:44.01]Because they shot whatever they shot.
[299:47.50]And it went... What was that?
[299:59.00]Oh, there's things I play down.
[299:59.92]Alright, I'm going to the other module.
[300:13.31]Really, I'm having a lot of fun playing the game.
[300:16.11]Get out of town!
[300:25.47]Pro tracking.
[300:30.69]I don't think it exists anymore.
[300:39.62]I think it's broken.
[300:44.00]In fact, I don't think this is a good idea, but I'm going to do it anyways.
[300:46.09]The module is gone.
[300:56.85]Oh.
[300:58.73]Wow.
[300:58.97]Who would have thought?
[301:04.65]What about over here?
[301:07.01]This is where it fires from.
[301:09.98]Cool.
[301:11.06]Alright, is there something I missed in here?
[301:18.70]There's another section I could go in, right?
[301:28.00]There's tracking, there's launching, and what was this one?
[301:30.20]This one I just came from?
[301:34.20]Control module.
[301:35.40]It's this one up here.
[301:36.91]For a second, I thought that was a probe module, and I was like, what did I just find?
[301:41.49]Did I go in this one?
[301:49.96]No, I can't.
[301:51.58]This is blocked off too.
[301:54.02]Alright, nothing in here anymore.
[301:55.12]Wait.
[302:12.99]Alright, I'm getting it out here.
[302:20.59]I went in all the modules, right?
[302:21.69]Except for this one... I'm kind of getting turned around.
[302:26.57]Go on the other side.
[302:36.28]Yeah, I need fuel.
[302:38.00]I gotta go to the ship.
[302:56.80]Okay.
[302:58.48]Um.
[303:00.40]Okay.
[303:02.64]Oh, God.
[303:02.80]Let me just stretch my back a little.
[303:03.92]Should I stay?
[303:06.16]Let me try going that other side.
[303:11.18]No, no.
[303:15.14]Stay.
[303:16.82]Stay.
[303:17.04]Stay.
[303:18.36]Stay.
[303:20.78]So, I gotta fly on the moon.
[303:24.50]So, I gotta go around
[303:27.86]Can I go from here?
[303:28.84]I can just fly down here, right?
[303:34.58]I need to go in the window.
[303:35.56]Is this the right side?
[303:44.22]Where was that window?
[304:00.94]Where was that cracked window?
[304:02.74]Put the scout there?
[304:05.24]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[304:10.36]Alright, what's in here?
[304:13.08]More stuff.
[304:13.96]Okay.
[304:36.43]Imagine, Privet, the probe tracking module will be the first to know the coordinates of the eye of the universe.
[304:41.01]You'll be the first to see them.
[304:43.77]I'm honored and terrified.
[304:46.32]You won't ask the orbital probe cannon to use so much power that it breaks, will you?
[304:49.56]Fret not, my nervous friend.
[304:52.68]We only need to fire the probe once.
[304:55.40]Anyway, so who minds if it compromises the cannon's structural integrity?
[305:02.15]I would mind, Mallow, I would mind, because we won't be capable of receiving our probe's data if the probe tracking module is destroyed.
[305:08.14]Gummy.
[305:13.46]Oh, there's one floating.
[305:27.43]That's the statue.
[305:39.44]Okay.
[305:42.98]That was weird.
[305:43.98]Let's grab the other one.
[305:45.75]What is this one?
[305:47.03]Let's try this one.
[305:50.15]What is that?
[306:10.33]Where is that thing?
[306:13.83]I don't know.
[306:14.53]Let's go see what they say.
[306:18.05]It's the other room.
[306:20.87]Hello, my better 50%.
[306:22.23]Cassava is sending the last of the cannon components soon.
[306:25.35]We'll know the ice's location.
[306:26.95]Yeah, didn't I already do this?
[306:29.75]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[306:30.91]Our elder's curiosity.
[306:33.50]Construction yard crew.
[306:34.70]A power setting.
[306:35.42]Didn't I already do this?
[306:39.55]percent certain yeah I did this already okay it's the other side can I do anything over here I'm reading somebody else's dms
[307:08.44]Well, what else is there to do in here?
[307:12.74]Look at this stuff.
[307:16.76]Alright, I need to put this data in and see what the hell I'm going to do next.
[307:19.70]I need to find this construction yard.
[307:22.30]I just broke my neck.
[307:23.58]I just shattered all my fucking vertebrae on the top.
[307:30.65]Alright, made it out.
[307:31.69]Now let's go to the ship.
[307:37.78]Input this data.
[307:38.52]I'm dead.
[307:45.81]Okay.
[307:47.59]I thought I was going to get crushed.
[307:48.87]Alright.
[307:56.34]Input the data.
[307:56.94]I got a lot of it.
[308:03.23]What do we got now?
[308:04.88]Probe cannon.
[308:06.42]Probe tracking module.
[308:07.74]Control module.
[308:10.74]Construction yard.
[308:11.76]You know, I built the orbit probe cannon at a construction yard on Giant's Deep.
[308:22.14]Alright.
[308:22.52]I know where we're going.
[308:24.25]Alright, question.
[308:31.77]No spoilers.
[308:33.82]But how far into the game am I currently right now?
[308:41.36]Are we at, like, how far?
[308:44.86]Like, percentage-wise?
[308:45.90]Somewhere around 30 to 40%?
[308:53.65]35%?
[308:53.67]35?
[308:53.69]Okay.
[308:53.83]All right.
[309:03.75]25, 30%, 25%, okay.
[309:04.87]I'm just making sure that I don't go too far, so this, because I want to stream this tomorrow too.
[309:16.64]Yes.
[309:19.48]That just exploded?
[309:23.02]All right, we want to go to that, what was it called?
[309:26.50]Giant's, Giant's Deep, right?
[309:31.63]It's right there.
[309:32.27]Alright, so we're going to find this construction yard.
[309:41.14]This is this planet that's all water.
[309:42.82]Alright, construction yard.
[309:46.51]Let's navigate this.
[310:00.74]Construction yard?
[310:05.85]No, but, I mean, looks like there's something, hold on.
[310:07.89]I'm gonna land here.
[310:12.65]Have I been here before?
[310:42.37]What is happening?
[310:45.42]Isn't this part of the planet?
[310:51.50]What?
[310:56.04]Where the fuck am I?
[311:05.81]There's a landing pad.
[311:07.13]The landing pad doesn't solve the problem of the whole island getting picked up and thrown into space.
[311:12.17]I'll park the damn thing on the pad, hold on.
[311:23.00]Alright, I'm in the pad.
[311:34.04]This whole thing can get picked up and thrown into space.
[311:36.18]Is this a construction yard?
[311:48.29]I don't know.
[311:54.24]Am I getting a jetpack tutorial booster?
[311:58.01]Okay, oh my god, I'm so embarrassed because it's been like popped up on the screen with my head I'm so actually embarrassed right now That I'm annoyed by that.
[312:08.28]I can't believe it.
[312:09.02]It popped up on the screen.
[312:09.76]I was like, why is it showing this?
[312:13.84]I've done this a hundred times.
[312:15.75]Yes, hold RT hold.
[312:17.69]Yes
[312:21.36]Guys, guys, I don't know why.
[312:23.20]I don't understand why I'm doing that.
[312:25.55]I don't get it.
[312:25.91]I don't understand.
[312:26.89]I've done this a thousand times.
[312:28.37]I've jumped like 50 fucking gaps.
[312:31.63]Why is the text even on the screen right now?
[312:34.05]Why is it doing this to me?
[312:47.34]It's the huge gravity!
[312:48.68]Right, I forgot.
[312:49.40]It's the only planet that... Oh my god.
[312:54.88]I forgot this planet has like times 10 gravity.
[312:58.32]It's the only one that does.
[313:12.65]Statue workshop.
[313:13.65]Ooh!
[313:15.95]It's broken.
[313:20.05]I can't get in.
[313:22.05]What the hell?
[313:23.75]Uh...
[313:44.45]Oh, okay.
[313:46.41]That was easy.
[313:49.16]Alright, I'm gonna jump over to there.
[313:56.56]And walk this way.
[313:57.69]Freeze detected.
[313:59.37]Alright, nice.
[314:14.49]Oh, I haven't seen this in my dream.
[314:30.78]Ooh, context.
[314:34.42]I'm dead.
[314:42.03]But what if we don't see the door and sneak the other way around?
[314:45.19]I really want to see the test too, but that's a huge risk to take.
[314:47.53]We probably shouldn't make Phloxel... Maybe Phloxel let us test it later.
[314:51.09]Phloxel told us not to do that.
[314:53.85]We're going to test the memory statues tonight.
[314:55.73]It'll be dangerous.
[315:08.20]Well, we got the clue at least, yeah.
[315:11.88]Memory statues.
[315:24.38]Every time I tune in, you die.
[315:39.59]There it goes.
[315:54.56]It's gone.
[315:56.62]Alright, I'm going to go back there.
[316:04.36]Statue Workshop.
[316:05.98]Statue Island.
[316:06.88]High Energy Lab.
[316:09.58]So these are going to connect eventually here.
[316:12.19]Statue Workshop leads to... Gabbro?
[316:16.24]Shines deep to learn more about the statue.
[316:17.98]Statue leads to here.
[316:20.42]You lead to Statue Island, which leads to the Energy Lab, which leads to the station, which then leads to the Sun Station.
[316:26.78]And then the whole game is... You've completed the whole game.
[316:32.42]Alright, I'm gonna head back there.
[316:47.45]Alright, we need the giant steep.
[316:49.81]I want to explore the statue place.
[317:11.84]Unknown.
[317:14.60]Still looking for whatever this is.
[317:20.97]What the crap?
[317:22.61]There's the secret moon.
[317:26.53]Still have to go back there and look at stuff.
[317:29.08]Alright, let's land.
[317:37.04]He didn't turn the stone off.
[317:38.36]The stove off.
[317:39.00]We'll go into space.
[317:41.28]It's alright.
[317:42.64]Alright, back.
[317:43.18]It's going so fast, I almost just got dunked.
[317:46.22]Alright, let's find... What was that little island again?
[317:50.14]Statue Island.
[317:54.56]It's right here.
[317:55.16]Slow down a little.
[317:58.21]That's actually not it.
[318:00.53]That's something else.
[318:03.69]Something else.
[318:04.91]I... I'm gonna check it out.
[318:10.45]There's so many things to look at.
[318:11.47]Here's the question.
[318:20.64]Let's go downstairs?
[318:27.09]Now, this is what I saw.
[318:28.31]There's dead bodies here.
[318:34.31]All right, the tornado is Giant's Deep.
[318:38.75]That's that symbol.
[318:41.41]You look like you were holding this.
[318:42.63]This is it.
[318:51.38]We finished building the final Orbital Probe cannon module and are ready to send it into orbit around Giant's Deep for assembly.
[318:57.16]All right.
[318:59.96]Next step would be to send Privet up to the Orbital Probe Cannon to install the probe tracking system.
[319:06.60]To all my friends here at the Construction Yard, which is here, my gratitude for your tireless work.
[319:12.79]I've given up hope, but I truly believe this cannon may actually succeed where many other attempts have not.
[319:19.29]I know my brother, Avans, and his spells will want to launch the probe with as much power as possible.
[319:24.42]I'm worried the cannon would break under the station.
[319:28.64]I propose we give Avins and Mallow a slightly lower maximum power setting than the absolute maximum possible to create room for their enthusiasm.
[319:36.56]Everyone's just not on the same page.
[319:37.81]Are you going gelatinous on us, love?
[319:41.69]I'm delighted by your words, but they're atypical for you.
[319:43.79]I'm ever half as gooey as Mallow and Avins behave together, Daz.
[319:49.68]You may launch me from the orbital probe, Anna.
[319:52.58]Don't we know this is the construction yard?
[319:56.28]That much is certain.
[320:03.76]Let's go over here.
[320:18.62]Um, we're gonna... Alright, makes no sense.
[320:37.70]Oh, I don't like this.
[320:39.06]I want off this ride as soon as possible.
[320:50.01]What's happening?
[320:58.58]Oh, it's a twister.
[321:02.86]I'm safe.
[321:05.66]You know, there's probably only... I get it.
[321:10.47]I get it somehow.
[321:13.31]When you go up in the air, this is your opportunity to fly somewhere else you cannot get under any of the circumstances.
[321:24.25]Alright.
[321:26.35]Long-range probes successfully launch from the over-the-cloak canopy.
[321:30.13]Alright, well, let's put this in.
[321:38.88]I got bad news.
[321:39.72]Yarrow says there was a problem with the proposed power source.
[321:42.69]So the Oracle Pearl Cannon won't be asked to fire.
[321:48.31]Yeah, this is... We saw this.
[321:51.65]Where are my friends?
[321:54.25]But no, they certainly didn't see the problem.
[322:00.22]Yeah, so this was where we had the building placed.
[322:04.18]Yeah, we already see this.
[322:07.76]It's another person's house.
[322:08.86]Yes.
[322:10.64]But we can do this.
[322:22.53]That brings us over here.
[322:25.79]I know.
[322:28.35]What is this?
[322:44.08]Why is it still picking up the guy from 12 million meters away doing the harmonica?
[322:48.14]Alright, well, there's a crystal here as well.
[323:01.64]I can do that after this.
[323:02.98]Alright, I'm gonna... I'm gonna make the jump over here.
[323:08.08]When we go up.
[323:10.52]Right now.
[323:14.88]Can I use this?
[323:16.04]Looks like I could use this for a second.
[323:20.42]I could block it.
[323:24.01]Yeah, I could just block it, couldn't I?
[323:35.94]Free detector.
[323:36.80]Thanks for the oxygen.
[323:47.72]Can I make this jump?
[323:52.15]Oh, boy.
[323:55.09]Yep, I'm okay.
[324:01.37]I'm alright, though.
[324:08.16]Okay.
[324:09.28]On the other side.
[324:09.96]Is there anything back there?
[324:11.86]There is.
[324:13.56]Another one of these discs.
[324:18.83]Now I gotta bring this disc out to the other side and play the movie.
[324:22.15]Unless they have one of those somewhere around here, which I don't think they do.
[324:35.10]Alright, bring it back to the other side.
[324:43.95]Guys?
[324:47.34]Yeah, let's go.
[324:57.13]Movie night.
[324:57.91]How would I go through the water?
[325:11.43]Um... I don't know.
[325:13.47]I did though, didn't I?
[325:17.01]Alright, new conversation.
[325:18.74]What is it?
[325:19.08]Uh, KonoiDaz and I were lifting orbitable probe cannon components into orbit for assembly and one somehow sank down beneath the current.
[325:33.60]SAVA convinced me not to try to recreate the phenomenon myself using other cannon parts because we're very curious to know what happened.
[325:39.81]How could something pass through the current?
[325:44.33]My gratitude for your interesting question.
[325:45.81]This is exciting.
[325:46.59]Spire constructed a model of giants deep here at the Brittle Hollow's southern observatory.
[325:54.23]And it reveals how an object might sink below the current.
[325:59.72]I am unable to grasp the answer by looking through the projection pool.
[326:02.76]If I visit the observatory, would you kindly explain?
[326:05.04]If you don't mind the trek beneath the surface to the South Pole, I'd be delighted to see you.
[326:10.74]The trailhead starts at Brittle Hollow's equator.
[326:18.32]Interesting.
[326:18.70]Uhh...
[326:49.21]This looks like that place I need to go.
[326:50.49]Cool, alright, well now I got some data, now I'm gonna move... Nothing else, right?
[327:07.01]I'm gonna go check that out.
[327:14.08]Walk across the top.
[327:16.36]Let's do that, come on.
[327:18.40]Cool.
[327:22.14]Hey, what's that?
[327:24.30]I think we're about to go into space.
[327:30.33]See, look.
[327:30.67]Why is that active now?
[327:32.37]Why are these active?
[327:33.07]Hold on a second.
[327:35.62]These are now activated.
[327:46.51]Stasis machines?
[327:56.34]Alright, I'm going back to the ship.
[327:57.20]I don't know why I'm bringing this with me, but I guess I am.
[328:11.65]Instruction UI connects to Southern Observatory, which connects to ocean depths.
[328:21.81]It's also syncing the underwater current, which they previously thought was impossible.
[328:27.24]Southern Observatory.
[328:30.88]Riddles Hollow's South Pole.
[328:37.69]The observatory, yeah, it's broken.
[328:39.91]But no matter what, the Southern Observatory is sort of the model of Giant's Deep that revealed how an object might sink below this strong current.
[328:46.97]So, I can't get in here.
[328:48.67]I have to go through this secret entrance.
[328:53.39]There's all this shit down here, too.
[329:01.04]Sun station.
[329:04.33]They debated building a sun station.
[329:08.53]Wait a minute.
[329:13.31]You built a station on the sun.
[329:23.85]Let's go look.
[329:30.10]If you did, then you did, right?
[329:31.62]What the hell is going on?
[329:50.88]Why am I rotating?
[330:03.25]Okay, I finally escaped.
[330:06.61]Sun Station.
[330:11.73]Can I get close enough to the sun to find this?
[330:13.73]I mean, I guess it looks like there's something right here.
[330:28.99]Or is that just flames?
[330:36.49]This might just be flames.
[330:45.12]I guess it just sucked me in.
[330:51.94]It just inhaled me.
[331:00.67]I was going too fast.
[331:02.07]Shit.
[331:13.68]You were going 300 meters a second and didn't slow down.
[331:16.08]I mean, I was holding the back button.
[331:23.79]I'm going to try... The sun is small now.
[331:27.39]Let's try it now.
[331:30.21]Sun station.
[331:33.71]I don't think there's anything on there.
[331:34.71]Maybe, like, just barely off the surface or something?
[331:55.54]Go to the sun at night when it's not hot.
[332:00.85]Yeah, you're right.
[332:01.45]That's not a bad idea.
[332:09.93]That scared the fucking shit out of me.
[332:13.38]That scared the shit out of me.
[332:17.28]What?
[332:18.46]Oh my god.
[332:19.40]There was no way in my brain that that was gonna happen.
[332:25.72]Okay.
[332:27.62]Is the quantum moon... a station?
[332:35.86]I don't... I mean, I don't see anything.
[333:02.37]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[333:03.51]What's that?
[333:04.89]What is that?
[333:07.93]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[333:09.38]There's something orbiting.
[333:10.38]What is that?
[333:13.72]What's that?
[333:14.12]Sun station?
[333:22.67]That's going way too up.
[333:23.91]I can't land on that.
[333:25.41]Are you kidding me?
[333:31.83]I'm on fire.
[333:38.80]You can and you will.
[333:49.84]Where is it?
[333:52.54]Man, I'm trying to pull up.
[333:53.51]I'm sucked in.
[333:54.43]I'm sucked in.
[333:55.01]Uh-oh.
[333:59.35]I'm trying to just, like, kind of float.
[334:01.01]That's moving so fast.
[334:04.57]So I have to match... How am I going to do that?
[334:14.92]It's super hard to land on it.
[334:17.39]I'll try it one more time, but... I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do that.
[334:26.22]I'll give it a try.
[334:26.90]I have to be going with it.
[334:30.27]Not against it.
[334:30.89]At least I know where it is.
[334:35.07]Maybe I should just ditch the... No, that's not going to work.
[334:56.03]Okay, there it is.
[335:00.47]I need to be going along with it.
[335:03.01]We have to spin this way.
[335:04.55]I'm going to slow down and I'm going to be moving with the bad things of orbit.
[335:11.65]I prefer to come back so I can tell what the hell it's doing.
[335:31.34]Kerbal Space Program?
[335:32.28]No, I tried to play Kerbal Space Program.
[335:34.13]I uninstalled the game after 15 minutes.
[335:36.61]There it is.
[335:36.95]Alright.
[335:37.29]Am I going to start burning here?
[335:44.77]Yep.
[335:45.33]Oh, fuck.
[335:47.35]Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[335:50.62]Please.
[335:53.14]How am I going to land on this thing?
[335:59.06]No way.
[336:04.24]No way.
[336:05.28]You can't do this shit.
[336:08.28]I'm gonna have to crash into the thing.
[336:16.51]Where is it?
[336:18.95]Where is it?
[336:34.19]Where'd it go?
[336:34.57]I just circled the damn thing, like, full time.
[336:38.75]Oh, come on.
[336:39.59]It was right behind me.
[336:41.55]Oh, god.
[336:42.72]Damn you.
[336:44.08]Damn you.
[336:50.84]This is fucking hard.
[336:58.96]I can't really park, either, because I'm going to get sucked into the orbit.
[337:01.38]I just have to try to stay up.
[337:06.94]I'm just holding right trigger right now.
[337:11.08]Just skim like this.
[337:12.22]And then wait for it.
[337:14.70]No.
[337:15.22]This is so hard to tell how much you're moving.
[337:19.53]I'm holding down left trigger right now.
[337:21.71]I'm holding it as hard as I can.
[337:23.91]I have no idea even where I am.
[337:44.42]Oh, thank you.
[337:45.74]That's seriously fucking insanely... I don't think I can do that.
[337:52.35]The speed around the sun?
[337:56.32]But it's pulling you down, so if I...
[338:14.87]Too much math.
[338:15.99]Too dangerous.
[338:17.95]I'm going to try this one more time.
[338:19.13]I'm just going to speed along the surface of the sun while I hold right there.
[338:32.92]Space is just so disorienting.
[338:35.23]Like, for instance, I just put that on the sun.
[338:36.85]I have no idea where it is.
[338:37.95]Oh, there it is.
[338:44.27]Alright, I'm going for it.
[338:49.07]Maybe I should just crash into it.
[338:52.81]Hey, it's the big orange thing.
[338:54.53]Alright, well, let me see where the trajectory is.
[339:08.86]Like, I'm apparently still going too fast.
[339:11.28]There it is.
[339:11.70]Alright.
[339:24.87]If I just hold down right... I'm holding down forward right now.
[339:30.58]I'm just speeding forward.
[339:32.84]I just got launched out.
[339:33.66]I don't think you're supposed to do this like this.
[339:45.47]You probably teleport onto this thing.
[339:48.59]You definitely teleport from a different location onto this.
[339:54.25]There's no way this is what you're supposed to do.
[339:58.29]No way.
[340:01.61]Okay, here we go.
[340:07.87]No, because even if I catch up to it... Alright, what's going on?
[340:11.53]I'm fucking holding down right trigger right now.
[340:14.18]I'm holding right trigger.
[340:15.42]What?
[340:16.02]What?
[340:17.24]Alright, I'm done.
[340:18.00]I'm not doing that anymore.
[340:18.88]I'll teleport into the fucking thing like I'm supposed to do in like three hours.
[340:25.00]In like four and a half hours when I teleport to that station, that's when we'll do it.
[340:29.32]Cool!
[340:42.89]I can't even like... I'm trying to fly along the coast of the sun.
[340:54.07]I can't think of any more things that would be stupid to do as an astronaut.
[341:00.33]Why don't we just skim the fucking surface of the sun, Greg?
[341:05.03]That's a good idea.
[341:06.29]Don't worry, I'm a good pilot.
[341:10.41]Alright, what do I actually want to do?
[341:22.11]Wait, let me... Hold on.
[341:31.52]Oh, right, the sand place.
[341:35.90]Alright, energy lab.
[341:48.25]Alright, yeah, I wanted to do this.
[341:49.87]I wanted to go to the statue place.
[341:53.85]Where's that statue?
[341:55.34]Did I already do it?
[341:56.56]No, no, no, no.
[341:57.08]I got sidetracked.
[341:58.16]Where is it?
[342:06.98]Sixth location.
[342:09.16]High energy lab.
[342:10.64]There.
[342:10.92]Statue workshop.
[342:11.78]Alright, I want to go back to Statue Island.
[342:17.54]And that's on that tornado planet.
[342:20.53]Cool.
[342:35.12]I just took my eyes off the road.
[342:36.68]That was not- No!
[342:38.15]It's my controller!
[342:40.57]What the fuck?!
[342:43.29]Okay.
[342:45.73]Why is this happening again?
[342:52.26]I fixed this shit already.
[342:53.70]Give me a break, man.
[342:56.36]Why did I get hurt?
[342:59.20]Good start.
[342:59.80]It's like looking at my watch.
[343:05.06]fucking goodness okay yeah this I think I'm using the I think I'm using the cord that remember I told you that I was having problems with my controller uh and it was the I had to get a new cord I think I'm using the old cord because there's shit everywhere in this room
[343:33.36]I think I replaced the chord with the old chord.
[343:42.29]Let's try this again.
[343:53.16]bad craftsman blames his tools well no this is this is the equivalent of you using a hammer and the hammer disappears out of your hand while you're about to swing into a nail and you punch yourself in the dick
[344:26.73]That was funny.
[344:27.41]Quantum Hammer was funny.
[344:28.85]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[344:29.67]Stop, stop!
[344:30.47]I'm going too fast.
[344:31.93]I'm going too fast.
[344:32.38]How am I going this fast?
[344:33.26]How am I going this fast?
[344:34.36]Okay.
[344:38.28]Statue Island.
[344:42.28]Quantum Idiot.
[344:47.79]Alright.
[344:48.25]Enough, enough, enough, enough, enough, enough.
[344:50.01]Enough!
[344:50.87]Enough!
[344:52.51]I'll take your position into consideration.
[345:11.53]At least one person in chat knows what that was.
[345:19.67]Nice.
[345:20.91]Nice Qbert reference.
[345:22.91]Thanks, man.
[345:24.33]I love Qbert.
[345:30.35]By the way, Qbert got a real diverse shit end of the stick, didn't he?
[345:35.90]Statue of Work.
[345:36.74]Alright.
[345:37.60]Nobody gives a shit about Qbert.
[345:40.55]He's one of the original classic video game characters.
[345:43.21]And Mega Man's talked about every day.
[345:46.59]Pac-Man's talked about all the time.
[345:48.97]Mario's every... Like, what happened to Q-Bert?
[345:50.71]Why does nobody like Q-Bert?
[345:51.55]Why Q-Bert not, like, show up in anything?
[345:55.43]I think the only time Q-Bert's shown up in any new media is... I think they, like, punched him in the face in Family Guy.
[346:01.42]Because he swears.
[346:13.07]It's not even a real square.
[346:14.07]It's like a comedy square.
[346:16.29]He's in Wreck-It Ralph.
[346:20.13]Imagine your first real appearance in two, three decades.
[346:24.48]He's on Wreck-It Ralph.
[346:25.98]Alright, let's open up the, uh... This thing.
[346:42.31]Alright, now I got a minute.
[346:44.15]Oh, let's read this.
[346:45.15]Because I didn't get to read this whole thing last time.
[346:47.85]Memory statues.
[346:48.59]Yeah, but what if we didn't use the other, the door, and snuck in the other way?
[346:56.66]Does anyone want to?
[346:57.70]He said, don't do that.
[347:02.48]Really want to see the test too, Lammy, but that's a huge risk we take.
[347:05.62]We probably shouldn't maybe walk, so let us see a later test.
[347:11.72]Okay.
[347:20.22]Oh, shit.
[347:21.90]All right, there's a way over there.
[347:26.82]Door's broken, but there's another way to go.
[347:34.57]But where is that other way?
[347:35.59]Fuck.
[347:40.05]Fucking Hubert.
[347:49.61]What are some other video game characters that really should have followed into this current popular culture, but never did?
[348:08.92]Frogger?
[348:11.52]Yeah.
[348:15.13]Frogger was another one, isn't it?
[348:20.84]Oh, wait.
[348:21.24]Wait a minute.
[348:21.62]I know what to do.
[348:22.54]I know what to do.
[348:23.16]I know what to do.
[348:23.64]I know what to do.
[348:24.04]Look.
[348:25.14]Where is it?
[348:25.94]Find it.
[348:26.22]Where's the secret entrance?
[348:39.30]Oh, shit.
[348:39.74]We're going down.
[348:47.40]Damn it.
[348:48.34]That's the right idea, though.
[348:52.11]That's the right idea.
[348:52.75]Got it.
[349:21.22]Alright, what about this thing?
[349:26.46]Wait, how much further down is this?
[349:29.96]I can find distress beacons too?
[349:31.84]Shit.
[349:32.20]This is nuts.
[349:40.24]Yara, would you kindly step back so Daz is closest to the statue?
[349:44.16]When pairing, the statue will choose whoever is in closest proximity.
[349:50.11]See how its eyes have opened?
[349:51.39]That tells us the statue is paired with Daz.
[349:55.17]Now, no matter where he is in the star system, Daz's statue will record his memories and send them to the Ash Twin Project.
[350:07.25]This is extraordinary sculpting work, Lox.
[350:11.61]He has outdone himself again, hasn't he?
[350:13.37]And now that we have our first successful pairing, we can test my memory storage prototype.
[350:20.23]Each statue will send a single Nomai's memories to his or her own storage unit within the Ash Twin.
[350:29.85]Each storage unit will be equipped with a mask, the statue's counterpart, which will be able to send those stored memories back to the corresponding Nomai.
[350:41.91]What the heck, dude?
[350:47.32]So I have a... I have like a USB drive on the Ash Twin.
[350:56.38]Interesting.
[350:56.72]Is that supposed to be me?
[351:02.72]Okay, so we go from my brain.
[351:06.18]It sees me.
[351:07.26]It sees everything that I've done and ever said and done.
[351:10.81]And puts it onto the cloud.
[351:13.07]Just like Google does.
[351:18.80]This is all for ad tracking.
[351:24.71]Okay.
[351:25.61]So, I gotta find that on the Ash Twin.
[351:28.67]Now I know.
[351:29.41]I have my own personal USB drive on the Ash Twin.
[351:31.93]This just got way more interesting right now.
[351:44.59]Right now, I'm sitting there going, oh fuck, I gotta get there.
[351:46.93]I gotta get there so I can delete all the times I went to the bathroom.
[351:49.41]I don't want to be seen there.
[351:51.15]I've installed the masks inside the Ash Twin project.
[352:03.14]Well, the only plus two I got for that one was from VR Josh.
[352:05.70]Everybody else did minus twos.
[352:06.88]That was a lot of minus twos in a row.
[352:10.56]Yeah.
[352:11.70]Alright.
[352:12.48]Fine.
[352:22.15]Jeremiah, has anyone ever told you that you look like Jeremy Albertson?
[352:26.09]That's me.
[352:26.53]Alright, I've installed the masks inside the Ash Twin project.
[352:32.77]They look beautiful, although I do feel as though I'm being observed.
[352:35.83]It's comforting to know the statues will not pair until the project succeeds.
[352:42.23]Otherwise, I imagine the experience would be hard to endure.
[352:46.71]Ideally, they'll only need to activate once the project succeeds as a safety measure.
[352:51.24]However, the statues will also activate in the event of the equipment failure.
[352:55.14]They will?
[352:58.06]Why is that?
[353:00.64]If anything goes wrong with the Ash Twin project, the statues and their masks will make us aware of the situation and enable us to fix it.
[353:08.39]Otherwise, it would be possible for us to remain permanently unaware of the problem.
[353:11.53]I hadn't thought of that.
[353:14.31]What a profoundly horrific fate that would be.
[353:24.51]Okay.
[353:25.84]So we gotta store our... Alright, is there one of those things?
[353:34.30]What the fuck is this?
[353:39.28]Wait, every time I die, I see this.
[353:40.64]And we fly through one of the holes.
[353:46.45]Huh.
[353:54.23]Okay.
[353:57.57]So those are the USB drives, then.
[354:00.06]What's up there?
[354:09.10]I can open this.
[354:13.01]On the other side.
[354:13.67]Hey, cool.
[354:14.55]Alright, there's something else up here, though.
[354:24.94]Okay, I thought... Hear me out on this.
[354:27.71]This is going to be hard maybe for me to describe or for you to see.
[354:30.77]But... That's a person with an astronaut helmet on.
[354:34.61]With two arms sticking out and two legs.
[354:36.79]And I saw a scout.
[354:38.51]And I was just like, there's a person here.
[354:40.06]I've got to talk to the scout.
[354:43.10]Ready?
[354:44.32]Left arm is right here.
[354:47.02]Right arm is right here.
[354:48.40]Hold on, let me do this one more time.
[354:52.73]Right arm right here.
[354:53.69]Left arm right here.
[354:54.39]There's the head.
[354:55.80]There's like the end of the helmet.
[355:01.24]Left leg, right leg.
[355:06.46]You're a psycho.
[355:10.68]Why do I have to be a psycho every time?
[355:12.08]I want to get up there.
[355:20.52]I want to get up there.
[355:34.52]I wanna get up there.
[355:35.22]Oh, this is how to get up there.
[355:37.76]Okay, cool.
[355:38.52]Read it!
[355:58.67]I'm curious, is sending a being's memories back in time the same as sending the being itself back in time?
[356:07.59]As an example, if we were to send my memories back in time, is that the same as sending me back in time?
[356:16.80]I imagine they're two different actions.
[356:21.77]Wouldn't both actions be effectively the same?
[356:29.26]I suppose that time was being rewritten.
[356:32.87]I believe this is different than receiving memories from what is effectively the future.
[356:39.17]But isn't the end result identical in either case?
[356:44.61]What do you want me to say?
[356:54.14]So they're sending memories back, but not a person?
[356:59.48]Does that make sense?
[357:00.16]Get out of here.
[357:09.27]My leg!
[357:14.11]It's because it's... Quantum.
[357:17.49]Right, I forgot.
[357:33.38]What?
[357:33.66]Oxygen.
[357:37.66]Let's dump it into the computer.
[357:47.71]Statue Workshop brings us over to Ash Twin Project.
[357:52.99]Every memory recorded by a Nomai statue is transmitted to a corresponding storage unit within Ash Twin.
[358:00.13]I think that... Look at how big that one is.
[358:01.90]This is a mystery one.
[358:03.78]All right, let's go.
[358:05.06]Ash Twin.
[358:17.89]Ash Twin Project.
[358:19.17]Okay.
[358:20.61]Right, right, right, right.
[358:21.55]Oh, I see.
[358:23.65]Okay.
[358:24.55]Where is it?
[358:27.71]Ash Twin.
[358:31.11]See, Jar Jar is the whole thing here.
[358:36.54]Where is it?
[358:43.42]Ash Twin.
[358:44.40]Can I get up there?
[358:49.00]Jar Jar's the key doll.
[358:52.14]I set the line wrong.
[358:53.14]What did I say?
[358:55.07]What did I say?
[359:08.46]What did I say?
[359:09.28]Jar Jar is the whole thing.
[359:15.18]Jar Jar is the whole thing here.
[359:16.58]Okay.
[359:19.66]Somebody just said this is the longest stream we've ever had.
[359:21.98]I do not think so.
[359:27.51]No, it's been six hours.
[359:29.27]The longest stream was about 13 and a half.
[359:31.25]Alright, engaging autopilot.
[359:35.57]Let's go.
[359:40.22]Not even the longest stream this week.
[359:42.20]Yeah, yesterday was like eight and a half, seven and a half.
[359:44.12]All right, go to Ash Twin and let's go.
[359:47.42]I want to go to the USB store.
[359:48.52]Okay, stop autopilot.
[359:57.55]I'm going to get sucked in.
[360:00.65]Sun time, sun time, sun time.
[360:02.97]No, it's not sun time.
[360:13.17]Am I?
[360:13.47]What's going on?
[360:16.31]Why is that happening?
[360:21.26]Um, what's happening?
[360:23.80]Um... Just get over there.
[360:38.36]Dude can't even fall into the sun right.
[360:40.48]Shaking my fucking head.
[360:50.41]Inertia.
[361:01.69]When you're going 600 miles a second, you can't instantly start going the opposite direction.
[361:10.40]But why is it doing this?
[361:12.97]I'm holding buttons to the right.
[361:14.73]I swear to God, this is not... I swear to God, I'm not doing this.
[361:19.40]I'm holding the fucking button, man.
[361:24.76]I'm going way too fast.
[361:26.41]I'm holding back.
[361:41.13]Okay.
[361:42.61]We gotta find the... Okay, slow down and land.
[361:51.90]Alright, good.
[361:53.28]Nice.
[361:54.20]Okay, get the fuck out of here.
[361:58.46]We're looking for this place.
[362:00.26]There's a place here.
[362:09.46]It's somewhere on this planet.
[362:13.60]It's the mask, and it's a USB room.
[362:22.15]Ash Twin.
[362:25.51]What's that over there?
[362:26.47]Oh.
[362:34.79]Can't get any of these .
[362:43.62]Wait.
[362:46.86]Up here?
[362:49.26]Is this connecting?
[362:50.56]Not necessarily.
[362:55.22]I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for.
[363:11.75]This is the only thing I've been able to find here.
[363:14.76]This shit.
[363:20.30]This doesn't really lead me anywhere.
[363:23.82]It's just this bridge.
[363:31.69]Unless there's sound?
[363:39.96]Cave shard down there.
[363:41.62]This thing's getting too big.
[363:50.10]Express beam?
[363:53.24]Unknown?
[363:53.92]I don't know.
[364:01.82]Look, this is... I remember being in here.
[364:09.99]Oh, look at that.
[364:14.67]Found something.
[364:16.65]Here's our first delivery.
[364:18.78]One Warp Core, fresh from the Black Hole Forge.
[364:23.28]Root is installing this core sibling on Brittle Hollow as I ride this.
[364:26.16]My gratitude.
[364:29.64]Married with this, the Ashdwin project is underway.
[364:34.40]I confess I'm deeply curious about what you and Poki found on the White Hole Station that started this project.
[364:40.77]Could I visit sometime to learn more?
[364:44.45]I recommend you do.
[364:45.07]The White Hole Station is the model for the towers being built for the Ashman Project.
[364:50.45]A visit to the station would be doubly useful.
[364:55.06]I suppose, more precisely, I would like to visit the White Hole Station with you, Larry.
[365:00.36]I'd be happy to explain our findings.
[365:03.49]I think I learned what I needed to learn End of the stream song
[365:30.21]I think that's the... I really, really needed that info too, so that's good.
[365:35.65]Well, now we just die.
[365:39.41]Have to watch it.
[365:46.70]Gonna be out of view.
[366:00.82]Here it goes.
[366:06.68]Oh.
[366:28.54]And then we fly through one of these masks, which is a USB slot.
[366:32.40]Then we go through some weird portal.
[366:37.52]Our memories have been played to somebody.
[366:39.59]And we go back in time.
[366:47.99]Somehow.
[366:58.43]Memories have gone back in time.
[366:59.69]We have shot the cannon.
[367:01.13]Okay.
[367:05.69]Let's download this data.
[367:10.07]Dude, you keep dying.
[367:10.86]You suck at this game.
[367:14.96]Yeah, I know.
[367:15.54]It's kind of tricky.
[367:18.24]I know what you mean, though.
[367:21.70]Alright, we've got Ash Twin Towers.
[367:23.73]Alright, we've got Ash Twin Towers.
[367:29.37]Black hole forge.
[367:32.13]White hole station.
[367:33.65]Energy lab.
[367:35.49]Black hole station.
[367:39.11]No minecrafted warp cores at the black hole forge before delivering them to Ash Twin.
[367:43.50]Alright, I gotta do this one.
[367:51.72]High energy lab in the canyon at Ember Twin's equator.
[367:54.76]In the canyon.
[367:55.42]We gotta go now.
[367:57.12]Canyon at Ember Twin's equator.
[368:08.60]Oops.
[368:09.47]I just landed on somebody.
[368:14.87]Turn off autopilot.
[368:26.84]You just killed a dude.
[368:28.18]No, I didn't.
[368:29.58]I did not.
[368:30.06]It's not true.
[368:32.32]I did not.
[368:42.26]Alright, abort, abort.
[368:43.16]It's right in the way.
[368:45.98]How do you not see this golf ball that's in the way?
[368:48.28]Autopilot.
[368:49.27]Stupid thing.
[368:49.91]Alright, in the canyon.
[368:53.73]How does that look for a canyon?
[368:58.47]How does that look in here?
[369:01.47]Gotta get into the canyon.
[369:06.31]Quickly, hurry up.
[369:07.71]Before all the sand fills the hole.
[369:09.16]Alright, into the canyon.
[369:13.95]In here.
[369:16.33]Now where in here is it?
[369:18.11]Is it?
[369:25.31]Is it?
[369:30.20]I don't know.
[369:40.49]Got something.
[369:42.59]Friends, if you find any sign of Coleus, I implore you to tell me.
[369:45.15]He vanished without a trace during our research trip, and he's been missing ever since.
[369:49.99]Uh, Mallory, some of us from the Sunless City are here to help search for Coleus.
[369:53.95]Can you tell us more about your expedition?
[369:57.37]You have my gratitude, Burr.
[369:59.13]Coleus and I were studying the cave's geology.
[370:01.07]We hope to learn more about a unique and wandering rock that visits several different caves in the area.
[370:07.40]Where was young Coleus lost?
[370:10.78]I think I already knew that info, but okay.
[370:41.49]It's like stairs here.
[370:42.87]Quantum shard.
[370:52.54]Unidentified signal.
[371:08.66]Wait, this is known.
[371:12.25]I've already been up here.
[371:17.03]Oh, this is unknown.
[371:18.33]I've talked to this person already.
[371:19.25]Church.
[371:32.42]Church.
[371:35.42]I have a question for you.
[371:36.95]Found something.
[371:37.47]I found, know my writing about the quantum moon.
[371:43.03]Yeah.
[371:45.19]I've observed the quantum moon orbiting each of the five planets, but sometimes it quite simply disappears from the sky.
[371:49.36]Maybe there's another place it travels to.
[371:50.80]Unfortunately, there is.
[371:51.56]I've never seen it.
[371:55.80]Quantum shirt.
[371:57.52]Quantum shirt.
[371:58.46]Okay, there you go.
[372:01.30]You got it.
[372:01.95]You got your comedy for a full hour.
[372:16.44]I still don't... I gotta find something here.
[372:20.34]I don't know.
[372:23.05]Okay, I need... I already got that cave shard.
[372:32.39]Alright, we gotta go north.
[372:37.87]Up here, down in this way, right?
[372:40.41]In there.
[372:48.92]Cave shards.
[372:50.72]Alright, that's enough out of you guys for tonight.
[372:53.34]That's enough out of you guys.
[372:59.88]Alright.
[373:03.47]Stop.
[373:05.17]Stop.
[373:05.57]The comedy meter is falling.
[373:08.81]Okay, there is...
[373:12.57]Here's the cave shard.
[373:14.86]That's death.
[373:18.42]Another shard.
[373:25.46]Let's just keep going this way.
[373:26.54]Here's the cave shard.
[373:31.19]I know I just... Okay.
[373:34.67]Cave shard.
[373:41.43]Police is missing.
[373:42.07]He vanished from the lakebed cave, the one at the bottom of the dry lakebed at the North Pole a couple days ago, and we're unable to find a trace of him.
[373:51.01]I don't... I beg you, if you're reading this, help us.
[373:57.81]This rock is familiar.
[373:58.43]Did you travel here, my sedimentary friend?
[373:59.99]Because your unique color and texture appear identical to the rock I met earlier.
[374:02.51]Isn't this some rock fragment of the cave we found at the bottom of the dry lakebed at the North Pole?
[374:08.77]We plan to re-examine the northern lakebed cave.
[374:12.15]Wow.
[374:14.13]Malera and I went back to the lakebed cave and observed this rock again.
[374:16.89]Sometimes it's there and sometimes it's not.
[374:19.79]That means this rock wanders like the quantum moon does.
[374:21.72]How curious.
[374:22.44]Very curious indeed.
[374:23.54]It's gone and therefore it's now at the top of the lakebed cave.
[374:29.34]Let's go.
[374:41.25]North Pole.
[374:42.61]This way.
[374:48.61]Like, in here.
[374:51.41]In here?
[374:51.83]This is a big cave.
[375:04.00]It's just so dark.
[375:06.00]I think I missed my opportunity.
[375:07.14]The sand is all here.
[375:11.72]Did I miss the opportunity?
[375:13.68]I might have.
[375:19.75]Don't think I have an opportunity here.
[375:31.15]The lake bed cave, it's down there.
[375:32.98]The sand's covering it.
[375:33.74]Yeah, might as well fly into the sun.
[375:42.78]Unless it's like here or something.
[375:50.50]No, it's definitely on the bottom.
[375:51.66]Lake bed.
[375:52.38]I think I missed the opportunity.
[375:59.71]Definitely missed the opportunity to do this.
[376:09.01]Oh well.
[376:19.32]start shoveling I guess I could go back to the quantum moon it's right there all right percentage check plus percentage check of me me getting to the end completing the game percentage check
[377:05.89]20%, not joking.
[377:06.51]40% for sure.
[377:07.41]Like 45%, 40%.
[377:07.71]35?
[377:07.73]30?
[377:07.75]40?
[377:07.77]No, put the suit back on.
[377:10.27]Alright, where do I want to go?
[377:11.55]Still shit to do.
[377:13.03]Let me look at the map.
[377:34.82]It's an ash twin project.
[377:43.57]I still have to do these cave things.
[377:47.11]Lakebed cave.
[377:50.65]Dry lakebed at M2.
[377:51.47]Alright.
[377:52.55]Let's go.
[377:53.19]I'm doing that immediately today.
[377:54.48]I'm just gonna instantly kill myself here.
[378:13.39]He's trying to ghost ride it.
[378:19.87]Alright, we're going to be quick.
[378:20.67]We're going to go right to the bottom of that lake bed cave.
[378:34.98]How I feel about the game so far?
[378:36.14]I'm intrigued.
[378:37.28]Because I kind of want to know... I kind of want to unravel its mysteries.
[378:45.43]I just want to know, right?
[378:48.65]There's an air of mystery here that I would like to know how it comes together.
[378:53.43]All right, I think it's a little puzzle that you put together in your brain that seems cool.
[379:03.18]All right, hurry up.
[379:11.80]While there's time.
[379:32.00]I gotta go up.
[379:35.43]I'm going right for the golf ball.
[379:44.01]I always just go too fast because I'm just... I go so fast.
[379:47.82]I go like seven trillion miles per hour, and then I can't stop.
[379:52.60]It's like a... It's like if you were on a train...
[380:04.10]Okay.
[380:41.70]Oops.
[380:45.60]Ah, Jerma has to eat a ghost pepper.
[380:47.32]Alright, get me up.
[381:00.41]Let's go.
[381:00.99]Just don't blow your speed out and go crazy.
[381:24.22]Is it going behind or in front?
[381:25.25]Okay.
[381:25.35]Alright.
[381:46.62]What the hell was I doing?
[381:48.81]Oh, the lake bed.
[381:50.11]North Pole lake bed.
[381:51.15]Yep.
[381:58.90]Don't you dare block me here.
[382:00.00]I don't even think about it.
[382:01.69]He's gonna block me.
[382:05.65]He's coming for me to block me.
[382:08.03]Asshole.
[382:44.74]Okay, hurry up.
[382:45.28]Let's go.
[382:46.34]Into the cave.
[382:47.84]North Pole.
[382:48.76]Oh, why did I not land on the south?
[382:50.21]I landed on the south pole.
[382:53.57]Just fly.
[383:08.18]Here it is.
[383:08.66]Am I going fast?
[383:11.30]Yeah, kind of.
[383:12.42]Okay.
[383:16.85]Alright, here we are.
[383:17.77]Where is it?
[383:18.75]A cave?
[383:21.08]This looks like a cave.
[383:24.74]What the fuck?
[383:26.50]Is this the first beacon?
[383:28.92]Beacon?
[383:29.22]Uh, hide and seek.
[383:31.64]No.
[383:31.74]Where the hell am I?
[383:58.85]What?
[384:01.61]Cave Shard is... over there?
[384:08.27]I... Stop showing me the moon!
[384:16.34]I don't care about the fucking moon!
[384:20.88]Is it right above me?
[384:22.56]It's above me.
[384:23.06]Oh, I'm getting squished.
[384:46.84]Damn it.
[384:49.36]Was I in the right spot though?
[384:50.80]It looked like it was above me.
[384:52.72]That was the worst sound.
[384:56.09]Yeah, that was a horrible noise.
[384:57.51]I had to go deeper in that cave?
[385:09.50]How?
[385:09.86]How the hell did I do that?
[385:29.04]Hurry up and go faster.
[385:30.12]I mean, I can't go that fast.
[385:41.99]I'm trying to go slow.
[385:43.15]I'm trying.
[385:51.55]Hurry up and go faster.
[385:52.55]Dude, I can't.
[385:54.38]I'm supposed to fly into the cave?
[386:03.17]Alright, where is it?
[386:06.45]Where's the- where's the- where's the North Pole?
[386:14.84]I don't know where- I don't know what- what- what the North Pole is.
[386:20.28]What's a landmark I can look for?
[386:27.24]Fuck, just get the fuck out.
[386:29.16]North?
[386:29.44]Yeah, which way is North?
[386:40.25]I'm running the equator.
[386:40.97]OK, all right, let's try this again.
[386:51.38]Get in.
[386:54.12]Good.
[386:54.36]Quick, get in here.
[386:57.96]All the way down.
[386:58.46]All right, I'm up.
[387:07.17]OK, I'm up.
[387:10.00]Okay, where am I?
[387:10.60]Am I in?
[387:15.43]Keep going.
[387:22.84]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going!
[387:41.39]It's above me!
[387:42.27]It's fucking above me!
[387:43.99]It's above me!
[387:55.23]Huh?
[387:56.11]Where the fuck did I just end up?
[388:00.82]Wait, what?
[388:03.40]Where is this?
[388:05.74]Why is it...
[388:12.50]Dude, that is... Alright, I... It's so disorienting down there.
[388:23.11]Did I miss the opportunity again?
[388:24.51]Stop looking for the signal.
[388:29.47]This is the cave right here, but like... I don't understand.
[388:32.85]I'm dead.
[388:41.37]In case you were curious, 11,000 meters that way, there's a quantum moon.
[388:47.67]If anybody wanted to know.
[388:56.82]Oh, and 60,000 meters behind you, there's a beacon somewhere over there.
[389:02.11]Just in case you wanted to know for your current objective.
[389:18.25]Signal doesn't do anything?
[389:19.05]Just go?
[389:19.41]I feel like that shit happens so fast.
[389:27.20]I wanna smash this game from making... You wanna smash this game from making that noise.
[389:43.06]So forget about the signal.
[389:43.98]Just run in and just keep going in.
[389:46.18]But I keep hitting the wall.
[389:48.92]It's blocked.
[389:49.78]Two or three of those paths are just blocked.
[390:00.21]Think of the cave as a maze you have to finish in under two minutes.
[390:03.03]That doesn't sound like something I want to do.
[390:32.49]Where's that northern section?
[390:35.79]Slow down.
[390:36.29]Let's go here.
[390:39.79]Is that north or is that south?
[390:41.13]I don't even know.
[390:42.53]Do I have a compass anywhere?
[391:01.67]Get in here.
[391:04.63]Right there.
[391:08.27]Fuck it.
[391:08.59]Dude, I'm just flying the ship in here.
[391:11.25]I don't give a shit.
[391:11.79]Let's go.
[391:11.99]I don't give a shit if this thing fucking explodes.
[391:23.43]Don't get crushed by it.
[391:24.17]Don't get crushed by it.
[391:25.29]Don't get crushed by it.
[391:26.51]I'm in.
[391:26.93]I'm in.
[391:28.11]Am I in?
[391:28.81]I'm in.
[391:29.01]Alright, left.
[391:34.74]And then... Left.
[391:38.55]Left.
[391:41.97]Uh, left.
[391:43.89]Right.
[391:45.13]Wrong.
[391:48.38]Right.
[391:49.32]Left.
[391:50.76]Right.
[391:54.25]Dead end.
[392:09.83]Motherfucker, I don't know.
[392:11.29]I get this tiny circle in the middle of my screen.
[392:16.41]I don't even know what direction I'm facing right now.
[392:19.51]I don't know what direction I'm in.
[392:24.39]I think I'm outside again.
[392:27.19]Where am I?
[392:28.75]Where's my flashlight pointing?
[392:32.09]What?
[392:36.11]Get...
[392:37.59]Am I in?
[392:38.51]Did I make it?
[392:41.93]Am I in?
[392:53.81]Use the scout?
[392:56.87]I... What?
[393:03.76]Where am I supposed to go from here?
[393:30.93]crunch incoming I can't fly right now I I just have no idea where this even wants to go am I am I supposed to go up this cave up here I mean that's what I'm trying to do
[394:13.44]Am I in?
[394:13.80]Am I... I'm trying to stand on this frog.
[394:27.75]I... Can I not stand on this?
[394:37.24]How did I not land on that?
[394:39.44]God damn it, man.
[394:40.88]Give me a break.
[394:50.37]It's pushing me off.
[394:59.93]What the fuck is going on right now?
[395:05.46]Did I do it?
[395:12.42]If I go out of this, am I gonna die?
[395:25.44]What?
[395:27.80]I can't go this way.
[395:35.23]Fuck this maze bullshit.
[395:46.43]Quantum fucking maze.
[395:49.09]What?
[395:52.89]I'm losing my goddamn mind.
[395:54.31]Are these teleporting behind me?
[396:24.30]I don't even know what direction I'm in.
[396:28.06]Wrong, wrong, but is it wrong?
[396:33.66]What the fuck are you doing to me?
[396:36.19]This is ridiculous.
[396:38.15]I don't know what to do.
[396:39.47]Am I going crazy or is this happening to you?
[396:44.22]I'm going crazy.
[396:45.48]I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
[396:47.34]Okay, don't, wait, don't.
[396:48.94]Alright.
[396:49.76]Alright, that's not cool.
[396:54.10]What do I do?
[396:55.84]Turn.
[396:58.52]You motherfucker, I figured it out.
[397:02.60]Now what do I do?
[397:03.04]Oh.
[397:19.20]Come on.
[397:19.66]Get out of here.
[397:21.38]Vern.
[397:22.66]Get out!
[397:37.48]I hate this.
[397:39.08]I hate this.
[397:40.42]I hate this.
[397:41.08]I'm almost out of oxygen.
[397:51.17]I did it!
[397:52.89]If you come here to look for Coleus, this is where we vanished.
[397:55.35]He's been missing for two days.
[397:57.93]What happened before Coleus disappeared?
[398:01.93]We were examining the different rocks.
[398:03.35]I recall Coleus standing on the largest one, the Wandering Rock.
[398:07.29]I was taking notes and then my lantern died.
[398:12.21]When I lit it again, Coleus and the rock were both gone.
[398:16.23]Your strange wandering rock friend is here, though Coleus isn't.
[398:20.68]Coleus and I observed this unusual looking rock shard in at least two other caverns.
[398:25.98]I'm unsure if this is relevant.
[398:27.94]I thought I was going crazy.
[398:31.04]I looked over at the chat and people were like, dude, like, what are you nuts?
[398:34.60]Like, stop.
[398:35.58]You fucking just walk straight.
[398:36.88]What's wrong with you?
[398:37.54]And I'm like, what's wrong with me?
[398:39.37]Like, what's wrong with me?
[398:40.67]Something's wrong with me.
[398:41.87]What's wrong with me?
[398:44.23]I thought I was going insane.
[398:55.00]It was like, dude, are you fucking serious?
[398:58.36]Like, get a grip, man.
[399:00.00]What's wrong with you?
[399:01.18]What are you doing?
[399:01.93]Alright, well, there's the cave shard.
[399:05.43]Do I move this thing?
[399:21.31]Um, now what?
[399:24.42]Oh wait, hold on.
[399:50.73]How do I... I can go... Hold on.
[399:52.57]Wait, wait, wait.
[399:53.03]Wait a minute.
[399:54.95]Let me do it.
[399:59.52]What the hell?
[400:00.34]Uh...
[400:25.84]curious this rock took me with it to a new location I wonder why this happened curious but also alarming this new cave appears to lack an entrance or exit also the rock that brought me here disappeared while I wasn't watching the wandering rock has returned never before have I seen been so delighted to see a sedimentary specimen
[400:48.23]I wonder if I myself become quantum briefly when the rock carried me here.
[400:53.54]This seems the clearest explanation.
[400:55.90]If the rock can bring me here, it can also carry me out.
[401:00.63]I can travel on this rock as long as I'm not observing my surroundings, meaning I must be in complete darkness.
[401:05.95]I'm going to bring my mentor here to see this.
[401:11.55]Meloria's here now, too.
[401:12.79]We theorize when a conscious being is in contact with a quantum object and ceases to act as an observer, the being can become entangled with that quantum object and they move together.
[401:26.69]Friends, Coleus has discovered a new quantum rule.
[401:37.48]Wasn't there another one of these down here somewhere?
[401:49.20]It was another one, wasn't there?
[401:53.12]It's the same one.
[401:54.40]No, I mean like in a different cave.
[401:57.16]Is this the same one?
[401:59.93]Oh, is this the same one?
[402:04.97]Well.
[402:09.87]Cool.
[402:17.04]I think I did everything I can.
[402:19.53]Are the lights on?
[402:20.17]Wait, hold on.
[402:38.66]Can I go more?
[402:39.18]Can I do more?
[402:42.31]Wait.
[402:44.61]It does go to another place, doesn't it?
[402:52.28]Okay, this is the one I was just in.
[402:57.06]No?
[403:01.41]Oh, shit.
[403:11.49]Friends, if you find any sign of Coleus, I implore you to tell me.
[403:14.32]Ah, this is where that is.
[403:17.40]Yeah.
[403:18.34]Alright, nice.
[403:20.17]Yeah, we read this already.
[403:21.08]So you're telling me I could have just stood on this rock and turned the lights off?
[403:25.38]And I would have been able to just tell it... Not have to do the... The streamer you're going crazy?
[403:31.15]Like, what's wrong with you segment?
[403:41.52]I felt so sad, too.
[403:42.92]I was getting so sad and almost upset and angry with myself because I keep seeing people saying, stop pretending and shit.
[403:49.13]I'm just like, am I?
[403:50.07]I don't think I am.
[403:51.83]Am I pretending to not know where to go?
[403:54.03]I was just like, what happened?
[403:58.96]How do I not know this?
[404:02.16]Oh.
[404:02.98]I'm dead.
[404:04.64]Well, alright, I got that mystery solved.
[404:09.38]So then, hold on.
[404:11.63]If I go on the moon, that means that if I turn all the lights off, I can go to the secret moon spot.
[404:17.40]I think it could have blocked me.
[404:51.10]Why do you let chat bully you so much?
[404:55.54]I don't.
[404:55.94]I usually... Hey, half the time I'm like, hey, shut up.
[404:58.64]What do you guys think you are?
[405:00.94]But I thought there was actually something wrong with me there.
[405:21.08]Don't let us affect you like that.
[405:23.64]I mean, I was in the you're losing your mind part of the game.
[405:29.30]I know it's all good.
[405:30.22]Don't worry.
[405:31.66]I know you guys aren't really trying to make me think I'm... Well, maybe some of you are.
[405:35.95]Alright, put it in the computer.
[405:38.47]Magnet cave.
[405:43.11]Done.
[405:45.43]Quantum moon locator.
[405:49.61]Sixth location.
[405:52.17]Quantum moon disappears sometimes.
[405:54.90]Well, what do you know?
[405:56.06]Interesting.
[405:59.70]Quantum moon time.
[406:11.41]There's a quantum moon right there.
[406:26.06]Where is it?
[406:28.72]Where's quantum moon?
[406:38.41]There's that fucking quantum moon there.
[406:43.79]Quantum, quantum, quantum, quantum fluctuations.
[406:46.53]Quantum.
[406:53.62]So you're telling me
[406:56.08]That all I have to do is close my eyes.
[406:59.68]And, well, we'd like to not go that fast.
[407:07.60]So I'm going to close my eyes on this moon.
[407:09.70]What happened?
[407:26.00]What happened?
[407:27.02]I don't understand what happened.
[407:42.29]Alright.
[407:43.79]I'm gonna make a comparison here.
[407:45.35]To something.
[407:46.31]And a lot of you guys are gonna know what I'm talking about.
[407:47.85]Remember when I played Darkwood?
[407:50.84]and I stepped in a trap every like four and a half minutes and it got to a point where everybody was certain that I was doing it on purpose they actually believed it I was like dude there's no way you're doing that you have to be doing that you've stepped in like 30 traps the sun is just a trap from darkness it's just I'm it just keeps happening there's nothing I can do about it
[408:19.58]Okay, quantum moon.
[408:21.11]I want to try this theory out.
[408:22.45]Where is the damn thing?
[408:31.38]Percentage check.
[408:46.84]Somewhere around 40 to 50?
[408:47.54]50?
[408:47.56]40 to 50-ish?
[408:48.40]50 to 60?
[408:48.86]40?
[408:48.88]50?
[408:49.04]Really?
[408:49.86]Alright.
[408:50.56]Because this is what we're doing tomorrow.
[409:07.11]And I want to make sure there's enough to do a full stream on this tomorrow.
[409:13.71]But it's been six and a half, seven hours.
[409:18.60]Okay.
[409:19.10]Alright.
[409:19.48]So is there... Those of you that are experts.
[409:22.95]Is there about six to eight hours left in the game?
[409:32.12]Yes.
[409:32.58]Probably.
[409:32.94]Probably more than that.
[409:39.00]For you, yes.
[409:39.66]Yes.
[409:42.26]Depends on how good you are.
[409:43.10]At least six to seven.
[409:45.52]Six to nine.
[409:46.84]Okay.
[409:47.08]All right, let's find that moon.
[409:51.57]Looking for the moon.
[410:05.99]I'm the quantum moon.
[410:07.85]Yeah, because I want to have a good, you know, like, six-hour stream.
[410:19.16]Six to ten-hour stream tomorrow.
[410:20.66]Like, there's a six to eight-hour stream tonight.
[410:22.32]Depends on how fast you can solve things, okay?
[410:26.00]Okay.
[410:40.85]All right, I got a photo I need to know All right, here we go Okay, we're on the okay now we're on the moon
[411:10.73]Unbuckle.
[411:11.23]Let's get out.
[411:13.80]Now, what do we do here?
[411:16.08]Somebody's dead.
[411:19.66]Who is this?
[411:20.10]They have a mask on.
[411:24.04]They're wearing one of these masks.
[411:25.44]They're wearing a memory.
[411:26.30]They're wearing a USB mask.
[411:28.48]Whatever that is.
[411:28.98]Okay.
[411:32.93]Somebody's wearing a USB mask here.
[411:34.35]Okay.
[411:36.25]They're on the ground now.
[411:40.33]You've landed on this guy.
[411:41.43]Alright.
[412:00.30]Let's not look.
[412:00.84]Okay, let's see what happens.
[412:03.26]Oh, he's just dead.
[412:05.80]Okay, I don't want to waste any time.
[412:08.40]Uh...
[412:10.54]Okay, any of the fluctuations?
[412:14.16]I'm just on the moon.
[412:20.31]Alright, so what am I looking for here?
[412:22.69]If I close my eyes, it will disappear.
[412:28.37]Right?
[412:28.69]Where did that go?
[412:33.06]Oh, wait.
[412:52.67]Wait, this moved.
[412:59.27]It's dark in here.
[413:01.13]It's dark in here.
[413:01.71]Now what?
[413:05.53]Where am I?
[413:09.25]New planet?
[413:27.25]This is Ice Planet.
[413:36.75]Flood.
[413:45.13]Wait.
[413:45.63]No, this is the... This is that... I think I've already been here.
[413:59.73]Isn't this like the tentacle planet, right?
[414:05.57]I want to go to that one.
[414:12.26]I've not been to that one yet.
[414:13.70]I've seen all these other ones, but not this one.
[414:17.36]Okay.
[414:23.90]We're here.
[414:39.39]Huh?
[415:15.00]Okay, well, goodbye.
[415:21.34]Rule of quantum imaging.
[415:23.76]Rule of quantum entanglement.
[415:26.10]Rule of the sixth location.
[416:16.90]Shit.
[416:22.16]What is this one?
[416:37.23]What the hell is going on?
[416:45.55]It's quantum now?
[416:51.76]I don't know the third rule.
[416:53.16]I don't know the third rule.
[417:07.03]What's over here?
[417:07.55]Anything?
[417:10.13]The sixth location rule.
[417:31.77]Where is that?
[417:41.73]Where's my rules?
[418:02.45]I wear my rules.
[418:03.65]If you recall the rule of quantum imaging, quantum entanglement... Let's go over the rules.
[418:18.12]Quantum imaging is, as long as I have a picture of something, as long as I can see something, it exists.
[418:24.34]If I don't see something, it could exist somewhere else.
[418:26.80]Correct?
[418:29.26]Correct?
[418:31.33]Quantum entanglement is... I can ride on top of the rock.
[418:39.07]Right?
[418:39.97]That's like you're entangled in the quantum and you can move around.
[418:46.32]The rule of the sixth location... This is the sixth location.
[418:55.53]What's the rule of the sixth location?
[419:07.44]Turn lights off.
[419:08.02]Wait a minute.
[419:20.21]Hold on.
[419:35.03]but I need to be able to stand in it image if I take what if I take a picture is just the door
[419:59.69]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[420:02.23]I have an idea.
[420:02.69]Alright, I have an idea.
[420:03.37]I'm going to take a picture of the door where it's empty.
[420:07.72]And then I'm going to... Hold on.
[420:12.08]Alright.
[420:12.56]Oh, Harry, watch this.
[420:13.34]Alright.
[420:21.83]Close the door.
[420:24.39]Close the door.
[420:30.01]Now turn the light off.
[420:37.46]Come on.
[420:40.18]Come on.
[420:40.78]I thought that was going to be it.
[420:41.78]And then... Fuck.
[420:51.29]I don't even know what this location is.
[420:52.61]Damn it.
[420:55.65]Okay.
[420:56.35]Okay.
[420:59.65]Let me... Let me, um... I can't move now.
[421:04.61]Okay, wait.
[421:07.85]Where is this?
[421:12.62]That's not where I want to be.
[421:13.62]I want to be... Is there water filling this place?
[421:17.64]Why is this place filling up with water?
[421:23.96]Uh...
[421:35.70]Quantum tree?
[421:37.80]Quantum tree.
[421:38.56]Okay.
[421:39.60]Quantum tree.
[421:40.52]Quantum tree.
[421:41.56]Quantum tree.
[421:42.16]Watch this.
[421:42.56]Ready?
[421:43.34]Okay.
[421:43.60]Quantum tree.
[421:45.42]Wait.
[421:45.92]Where's the... Wasn't it just back here?
[421:47.38]Wasn't it... Where is this?
[421:52.91]Hold on.
[421:55.53]Is this even... This is not even a plant... Wait a minute.
[422:05.28]This is not the... This is a different location.
[422:19.60]This is not that planet.
[422:30.32]This is bullshit.
[422:31.36]We're not even on that planet.
[422:40.76]All right, hold on.
[422:41.38]Let me get out.
[422:45.03]Close this.
[422:45.57]I'm going to check out.
[422:47.13]I'm going to explore the other fake planet.
[422:50.57]I think I just broke it.
[423:06.41]All right, let's see what happens when I go back over over here Okay, let's check this out Because these are fake planets this is not real look at this is not even real There's probably some clue around here somewhere
[423:51.99]This is the moon.
[423:54.67]But why does it look like this?
[423:58.52]I'm missing something and I don't know what it is.
[424:23.06]What is it, though?
[424:25.64]Rule the sixth location.
[424:32.34]That's this thing.
[424:38.43]Do I take a picture of the moon?
[424:46.94]What if I
[424:58.39]Because, I mean, it's just a... Hold on.
[425:07.62]Alright, where is it?
[425:35.63]Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow!
[425:38.91]Where am I?
[425:43.54]I'm out of fucking fuel.
[425:44.76]Get back there.
[426:15.27]That was very fast.
[426:18.03]Alright, but if it's the rule, if the sixth location is just the moon, then I need to keep the moon in place?
[426:29.18]The sixth location is the moon.
[426:47.73]Rule of the moon.
[426:49.27]Rule of the sixth location.
[426:52.19]What is this?
[426:52.63]I don't even know what the sixth location is.
[426:55.67]Wait, let me look.
[426:56.41]I don't have any... Alright, I didn't even do this shit.
[427:01.95]Giants deep.
[427:02.87]The lore about the statue.
[427:05.45]Didn't I do this?
[427:06.05]Alright, we're going to Giants... No.
[427:31.51]There's a path beneath the surface that leads to the observatory.
[427:40.06]The trailhead starts at Brittle Hollow's equator.
[427:44.18]Alright, let's do that.
[428:00.97]Brittle Hollow's equator.
[428:02.47]Let's give it a look.
[428:08.29]Somebody said, this is boring.
[428:10.09]Go back to flying into the sun.
[428:18.10]Have I been to Dark Bramble?
[428:19.24]Yes, I have.
[428:19.72]I did a lot of the stuff there.
[428:24.94]Brittle Hollow.
[428:26.31]The equator.
[428:34.57]It's pretty much right here.
[428:35.43]I haven't really done much in this planet anyways, so I might as well just fuckin' crash into it and fuckin' everybody laugh!
[428:49.54]Alright.
[428:52.20]Waiter.
[428:53.20]Lookin' for this place to go in.
[428:55.08]Holy shit.
[429:01.58]Okay.
[429:05.22]Here's the equator.
[429:05.98]There's this thing.
[429:09.86]Trees detected.
[429:11.90]Alright, we have some new info.
[429:15.46]Oh.
[429:17.34]Well, shit.
[429:20.04]Okay.
[429:25.12]Trees are moving.
[429:26.12]The trees in this grove wander about freely.
[429:28.62]This is not normal, even for this alien planet.
[429:31.74]I never see them move.
[429:33.24]Is this even possible?
[429:36.55]If anyone else witnesses this disturbing behavior, I implore you to record your observations here.
[429:40.17]Either these trees are aberrant, or my brain must be.
[429:44.97]Plume is right.
[429:45.39]The trees do move.
[429:46.25]I confess I didn't notice until I read these notes.
[429:50.36]Alarmingly, it isn't only the trees.
[429:52.30]There is other matter in this area, such as that unusual shard of rock moving in the same eerie way.
[430:01.76]That rock is unusual for another reason, too.
[430:04.76]It possesses color and texture I've never seen elsewhere on this planet.
[430:08.98]This rock shard's presence is significant.
[430:10.68]We should study it.
[430:11.48]Could it be what is causing other nearby objects to move?
[430:14.54]I don't know.
[430:26.25]Power shard.
[430:27.01]I already got that.
[430:27.81]Wait.
[430:28.17]Does it disappear?
[430:29.21]If I don't look at it.
[430:34.47]What does it go?
[430:38.11]Can I stand on it?
[430:39.63]Yeah, imagine the moon.
[430:49.64]I think I've already read this.
[431:03.31]From the wandering moon.
[431:06.12]Perhaps it's even a small piece of the moon itself.
[431:15.32]Alright, so it's a moon.
[431:20.78]Alright.
[431:21.96]Okay.
[431:23.58]Alright, turn the lights off.
[431:25.56]Close my eyes.
[431:28.76]I read this like four hours ago.
[431:30.25]Yeah, I did.
[431:31.77]Why is it so dark?
[431:42.52]Alright.
[431:42.72]Oh, shit.
[432:12.10]There's the black hole.
[432:12.94]I haven't fallen in that earlier.
[432:21.62]There.
[432:22.00]Quantum.
[432:25.76]What's this quantum?
[432:27.71]Entrance to the Tower of Quantum Knowledge.
[432:29.59]Alright.
[432:30.03]I'm going there, but what's over there?
[432:32.49]Southern Observatory.
[432:33.61]Wait.
[432:33.83]I need to do this too.
[432:49.90]Arcane Sanctuary?
[432:50.92]Alright, where the hell am I doing?
[432:55.61]Can I turn it on?
[433:29.86]Oh, I must have missed it, I think.
[433:36.19]I thought it was just going to go.
[433:42.10]Wait, hold on, I might be able to get caught in it.
[434:02.00]I found Ryback.
[434:08.38]Hi, Ryback.
[434:11.95]Oh, you launched.
[434:12.53]That's great.
[434:13.11]Great job to you.
[434:14.61]Well, I guess that means I've been out here a while, huh?
[434:16.23]Well, this is Brittle Hollow, but you probably knew that.
[434:20.85]lot of history here it's great what are you doing here I'm here to see the hanging city um should we be concerned about what just just fell okay it's always been my dream to see it with my own four eyes ever since I saw a hatching did you miss it because I think it was behind you an alien race lived in the solar system long before our species even existed how could I not want to see what their civilization was like
[434:53.00]Only, you've probably heard the other say it, right?
[434:54.66]I'm afraid of space.
[434:55.56]Seriously, I'm more surprised than anybody that I'm out here.
[434:57.62]Wanna know how I even got this far?
[435:00.40]I fell.
[435:02.35]Me too, Ryback.
[435:03.49]Me too.
[435:04.79]Tripped over a gravity crystal.
[435:06.31]It's dumb luck I landed somewhere my little scout says is halfway stable.
[435:10.77]Instead of being sucked into what's below.
[435:14.09]Engage in the stability of the ground around me using my little scout.
[435:16.66]Needs to be the place with the best surface integrity.
[435:20.99]I'm just going to stay here until I'm ready to move on.
[435:23.88]That's enough about me and my problems.
[435:25.72]You didn't come all this way to listen to me blather, did you?
[435:28.00]Yeah, that'd be yeah.
[435:30.50]Hey, I learned something.
[435:32.02]I saw the sunless city on the Ember Twin.
[435:33.46]You mean there's another know-my city inside the Ember Twin?
[435:36.99]That's incredible.
[435:37.69]A whole city and I had no idea it existed.
[435:39.31]How'd they keep the sand out?
[435:42.45]For me, I'd be nervous about getting buried in the caves by that awful river of sand.
[435:49.09]Gosh, the Nomai sure were ingenious, building an entire settlement underground.
[435:52.54]The Sunless City, wow.
[435:55.52]Wow.
[435:56.86]That means there were two groups of Nomai, one that lived on Ember Twin and one that lived here on Brittle Hollow, but they must have traveled around the solar system since Nomai writing can be found on other planets too.
[436:05.80]Hmm.
[436:11.14]Where should I look here?
[436:12.78]Where shouldn't you explore?
[436:14.06]Um, not the black hole.
[436:15.28]That's very no, which is unfortunate because the most exciting stuff is below the crust, including the Hanging City.
[436:22.40]That's just to the north.
[436:23.68]You can kind of see it from here.
[436:26.72]There's also this big dome on the South Pole called the Southern Observatory.
[436:30.72]You can't get inside from the surface.
[436:32.10]Trust me, I tried.
[436:34.02]But it's like the rest of the Nomai structures here.
[436:35.73]There's probably a path to it beneath the crust somewhere.
[436:38.05]Good luck with exploring.
[436:40.19]Love to hear it.
[436:43.12]Okay, we got some new info.
[436:44.58]Who's going for whatever that is?
[437:25.30]Let me back in Let me back in Let me back in Let me back in
[437:54.52]Can I reach that from here?
[437:55.40]No.
[437:56.02]I'm just gonna go to the interloper.
[438:02.15]I'm actually going pretty fast.
[438:20.74]Okay, all right, all right, all right.
[438:22.98]I'm in perfect trajectory.
[438:27.76]Blow it up.
[438:28.14]27, 28, 26.
[438:29.77]2000.
[438:29.85]17, all right, keep going. 15.
[438:51.70]13 12 11 10 9 okay slow slow slow 29. all right where was there the interloper is this an asteroid
[439:31.53]Alright, land.
[439:37.15]I'm alive.
[439:37.51]I'm alive.
[439:39.17]I'm alive.
[439:39.77]I'm alive.
[439:40.19]I'm alive.
[439:40.57]Alright, let me... We're not going into the sun, are we?
[439:49.04]No.
[439:50.30]Are we?
[439:50.58]No.
[440:12.64]Distress beacon?
[440:13.69]There's a distress beacon up there.
[440:16.47]Alright.
[440:18.63]What's going on?
[440:20.69]Hide and seek.
[440:23.41]No, there's no frequency over here.
[440:25.51]Alright, what am I... Am I looking for something up here?
[440:27.10]Something to look at?
[440:27.78]Is there anything even up here?
[440:40.54]What about on the top?
[440:55.21]No?
[440:57.47]What's even up here?
[441:00.61]It's just a giant ice.
[441:04.83]Wait a minute.
[441:05.33]What's that?
[441:06.67]Something.
[441:08.15]Something.
[441:14.98]It's me.
[441:18.60]Something right here.
[441:23.21]Something!
[441:28.09]Come on, I just need to see it before I die.
[441:30.29]Before I die.
[441:31.43]Before I die.
[441:32.27]Come on.
[441:34.49]I need to see it before I die.
[441:35.35]I need to see it before I die.
[441:41.40]Please!
[441:41.74]I just need to see it before I die.
[441:46.36]There's nothing to see.
[441:47.08]Turn around.
[441:48.46]I mean, I'm dead.
[441:51.66]What did I miss?
[441:55.56]I was too focused on my breath meter going to zero.
[442:04.61]I went too fast.
[442:11.51]Golden Detriever brain?
[442:12.57]Golden Detrievers are like the smartest animal.
[442:14.12]So, dude, what the fuck?
[442:15.70]Do you think I care about you saying that?
[442:17.06]That's one of the smartest animals on Earth.
[442:28.30]Alright.
[442:29.36]I think I'm gonna call it here.
[442:33.67]I'm gonna call it here.
[442:34.39]I'm gonna call it here.
[442:35.05]I want... Because I'm getting addicted to the game.
[442:37.29]And I want enough for tomorrow as well.
[442:45.99]Power of Quantum Knowledge.
[442:47.67]Pypex Camp.
[442:49.17]Hanging City.
[442:54.79]Go back to the comet first.
[442:57.09]Alright.
[442:57.39]I'm going to just fly the ship to the comet.
[443:01.42]And see if I can find what you were talking about.
[443:11.72]Where's the interloper?
[443:12.98]There it is.
[443:15.69]Far away.
[443:25.22]I'm going to assume there's probably at least another good six to eight hours left of the game.
[443:32.02]Nothing like that.
[443:33.38]Have I peed one time?
[443:34.87]No.
[443:35.87]I have not gotten up for a single break.
[443:37.93]No, you're right.
[443:41.29]Maybe a little bit more than that?
[443:42.39]That's alright.
[443:46.55]I plan on trying to finish this game tomorrow.
[443:54.49]That's the plan.
[444:02.44]You could beat it tonight.
[444:06.00]Well, we'll see.
[444:06.60]We'll see where it takes us.
[444:08.34]There's more than enough game for another day, I can tell you that.
[444:10.26]Alright, well, that's it.
[444:10.84]We're just going to finish it tomorrow.
[444:14.80]And then after that...
[444:17.57]Should be able to play Tony Hawk.
[444:20.07]For some reason, the Xbox 360 hard drive is not in.
[444:24.79]I'm going way too fast, boys and girls.
[444:27.53]And this is what happens when I'm not paying attention.
[444:29.04]I'm just talking.
[444:29.72]I am okay, I think.
[444:36.74]Just damaged the headlights a little.
[444:39.10]Who cares?
[444:52.97]Alright, let's see if I can find this, what you guys are talking about.
[445:05.65]Okay.
[445:07.50]So there was apparently a ship that you said?
[445:09.96]I missed a ship.
[445:18.50]This is just a suicide mission.
[445:20.00]Yes.
[445:26.27]Over here somewhere?
[445:27.05]Because I remember this is this part.
[445:35.21]Okay.
[445:43.31]Alright.
[445:47.92]What's that light?
[445:48.48]No?
[445:57.07]Okay, what about over here?
[445:58.15]Uh... I don't see anything.
[446:18.99]Like that way?
[446:21.83]oh we're going towards the sun might have to be careful why is it moving so fast now
[446:50.79]Now I can reach this.
[446:57.73]Where the hell is that ship?
[447:02.86]I think I'm out of reach.
[447:07.75]I literally can't go anywhere.
[447:20.46]I'm dead.
[447:23.86]I just got... I was trying to find this thing, and now... The sun was coming up, and I thought I was gonna fucking fall into the sun.
[447:35.63]I don't... I don't know if this is... I don't know how to do this.
[447:41.61]On the side with the spikes.
[447:42.79]I feel like I was on that side.
[447:45.29]Let me try this one more time.
[447:49.62]One more time.
[447:53.36]He's dead.
[448:03.89]Wasn't I in the spikes when I fell off?
[448:18.89]didn't look yeah but I mean the thing's made out of ice and you just skim I can't like walk on the surface I'm just skimming across the surface I can't walk on it there's no gravity on this thing all right last try and then uh that's the end of the stream
[448:58.34]It's a million years away.
[449:00.36]He's addicted?
[449:21.54]I think a little.
[449:22.44]I think I'm more addicted to one, just want to know what the hell happens.
[449:29.89]The story has me intrigued.
[449:31.09]I want to know what's going on.
[449:33.84]Why am I teleporting back through time?
[449:39.74]What did these people do?
[449:41.68]What did this other civilization do?
[449:44.02]And why are we here doing this?
[449:56.05]alright see you later I'm going to bed I'm sitting here talking to you guys I'm sitting here looking at chat with holding the button and I'm just like yeah you know I'm addicted and I like to talk about the story and seeing what you guys have to say still going negative miles per hour I'm like 10 I'm much further oh god whatever okay
[450:27.11]Let's try this again.
[450:27.83]This thing's so tiny.
[450:30.06]It's so hard to... It's just such a small little fucking asteroid.
[450:38.26]Like, this is why space games are hard for my brain.
[450:40.06]I feel like I'm not even moving right now.
[450:43.78]In my fucking cube brain, I'm standing still.
[450:47.57]And here comes the trash planet.
[451:07.17]try to get on the spikes what am I looking for here
[451:38.70]I see something underneath.
[451:40.30]No, that's not.
[451:40.82]That's not anything.
[451:41.39]That's nothing.
[451:43.79]Right in the middle?
[451:51.13]Right there?
[451:51.59]Right there.
[451:52.85]Right there?
[451:53.27]Alright, what's that?
[452:01.60]Found it.
[452:06.04]Suicide mission.
[452:06.62]I don't care.
[452:22.37]This is troublesome.
[452:23.09]It seems the comet wishes to submerge our shuttle in ice.
[452:26.77]If we stay on the surface too long, the shuttle may freeze entirely.
[452:30.79]Even if it did, couldn't someone call it back home to the gravity cannon on Ember Twin?
[452:37.06]Yes, but the exploration of the comet would be more difficult if we were without the shuttle.
[452:41.24]Someone recalled it.
[452:43.08]Perhaps we shouldn't have landed on the dark side of the comet.
[452:46.65]Suppose one of us remained on the shuttle, in the shuttle, to keep it warm and continue monitoring the surface.
[452:51.78]This would be wise, I think.
[452:53.76]Larry, if you don't mind waiting here with it, Coke and I can continue to investigate the surface.
[453:17.81]I didn't jump.
[453:19.12]I didn't jump.
[453:20.14]I did not jump.
[453:21.60]I didn't press any buttons.
[453:24.82]I didn't do anything.
[453:26.62]It sucked us out.
[453:27.72]Did you not see my friend the ship getting sucked out?
[453:31.53]I didn't do anything.
[453:50.36]Get in!
[453:51.38]Okay, we did it.
[453:53.88]Let's download that data.
[453:54.94]Alright, that's it.
[454:08.68]I'll see you guys tomorrow for more Out of Wild.
[454:14.32]We'll try to finish the game.
[454:30.30]Final Sun joke?
[454:31.34]No, no, no, no, no.
[454:36.20]Something here.
[454:36.82]I want to see.
[454:42.52]Hey, remember, that was a good try.
[454:43.84]Hey, thanks.
[454:49.29]Alright, what else is on here?
[454:58.79]Okay.
[454:59.51]What else is on here?
[455:03.39]Something else?
[455:16.14]Wait.
[455:17.48]Wait, the ice can melt?
[455:18.46]Wait.
[455:20.74]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[455:23.50]Holy shit.
[455:24.36]The ice is... Okay, hold on.
[455:27.12]Where's the tail?
[455:42.06]All right, where was that?
[455:42.96]Here it is.
[455:43.26]All right, this is gonna melt.
[455:45.78]All right, this is gonna melt.
[455:56.44]Want to melt?
[456:18.63]It's like a Subway sandwich.
[456:20.73]The quantum melt at Subway.
[456:25.92]I'm so far away from the sun.
[456:27.38]Am I even going to come back there?
[456:32.30]Holy shit, I want one of those.
[456:34.46]Quantum melt?
[456:35.16]Seriously?
[456:36.22]That would be turkey, ham, like six different kinds of cheeses.
[456:42.03]It'd be like Swiss, cheddar, provolone, gruyere, brie.
[456:46.65]It'd be every cheese.
[456:48.85]Here we go.
[457:03.87]We're not even on the way back.
[457:05.05]I'm just gonna sit here.
[457:13.82]I'm not gonna move, right?
[457:21.26]Secret menu?
[457:29.78]Check the orbit?
[457:30.40]Yeah.
[457:33.15]Wait, is this going to take too long?
[457:34.08]Is this song going to explode?
[457:41.60]Just read bits.
[457:42.44]Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
[457:43.88]I'll just read bits.
[457:51.70]That sounds good.
[457:52.18]Okay.
[457:59.67]It's still going.
[458:00.35]It's still moving, right?
[458:03.39]Or is it paused?
[458:05.05]Is it paused when it's all tabbed?
[458:10.56]I think it's paused when it's all tabbed.
[458:17.12]Well, I can do it.
[458:17.72]Because I can just load up the screen over here.
[458:20.21]Alright.
[458:21.99]Let's go back.
[458:22.45]Thanks.
[458:22.73]That's the end of the stream.
[458:23.83]See you guys tomorrow.
[458:28.77]Let's go back a little bit and read some bits.
[458:33.02]SuperBruce gave five community subs.
[458:34.41]Thank you, SuperBruce.
[458:36.23]Appreciate it.
[458:36.69]That was earlier, about six or seven hours ago here.
[458:41.41]Seven or eight hours, actually, almost.
[458:44.07]SweetCrock, thanks for the 1,500 bits.
[458:46.93]$15.
[458:47.91]They say, hey, Jeremy, I've been watching for a while.
[458:52.79]Finally getting to donate.
[458:54.33]Outer Wilds was my game of the year last year, and maybe my favorite game of the last five years.
[458:57.96]Hope you enjoy it.
[458:58.72]Can't wait to watch.
[459:01.01]It is very enjoyable.
[459:02.35]I especially like the story.
[459:05.65]I want to know why this is happening.
[459:09.55]Somebody's just breathing in your room.
[459:11.19]Yes.
[459:12.22]Did nobody say that?
[459:13.00]I did.
[459:17.00]But thank you.
[459:17.40]Appreciate the 1500 bits and it's pretty good so far.
[459:19.88]We'll see how I feel about it after another day.
[459:21.96]I feel like I'm probably going to like it though.
[459:25.35]It seems really good.

[460:09.32]Hold on.
[460:12.32]No, we're good.
[460:13.76]We're actually getting close.
[460:20.55]Uh, thank you to, uh, Hikiko Morris Sunday for the 300 bits.
[460:27.44]They say, Hi Jerm, a couple weeks ago I had a dream that I sent a message in chat saying that I was having a birthday party but no one showed up.
[460:32.78]So you doxxed me to encourage people to come over but no one showed up.
[460:39.32]Anyway, what's your favorite Destiny's Child song?
[460:41.20]Mine is Say My Name.
[460:42.27]Uh, that one too.
[460:49.71]I like that one.
[460:50.57]That's good.
[460:52.71]Digitron Surfers, thanks for the 500 bits.
[460:57.35]in the upcoming youtuber movie series are you going to be playing penis germa or are you going to just to play yourself I love your channel I don't even know what that means uh bryant ziggs thanks for the hold on we're almost there all right let's see what happens uh bryant ziggs thanks for 1500 bits germa I had a dream the other night that you were doing a live show in my another dream
[461:30.38]Wait.
[461:33.53]It didn't melt?
[461:59.97]That didn't do anything!
[462:01.55]Alright, goodbye.
[462:19.04]Funny jump joke.
[462:20.16]I didn't press jump.
[462:22.34]I didn't.
[462:22.78]The sun comes up and fucking pulls you up.
[462:26.84]And I was holding left trigger.
[462:29.60]Run it back.
[462:30.62]I was holding left trigger and like forward phasing down.
[462:33.27]No.
[462:34.33]No, I got baited and that's fine.
[462:35.41]I can just quit, right?
[462:41.55]Reset, loop, and quit?
[462:42.97]Yeah, right?
[462:49.30]This is okay.
[462:56.94]Alright.
[462:58.38]We'll see what happens at the end of the game tomorrow.
[463:02.43]Very cool.
[463:06.47]I'll see you guys tomorrow for more Outer Wilds.
[463:10.91]Let's get the actual intro or intro-outro up.
[463:16.76]See what happens tomorrow.
[463:19.53]I'm going to be starting... What time am I going to start tomorrow?
[463:29.24]Two?
[463:29.70]Again?
[463:29.92]And we're on like 145?
[463:31.93]132?
[463:31.95]Something like that?
[463:39.42]But we had the $15 from Brian Ziggs.
[463:41.50]Thank you, Brian.
[463:42.00]I would never do that to somebody.
[464:11.69]I'm sorry that Dream Germa is a nuisance and a menace to society.
[464:19.58]I don't know why.
[464:24.30]Evil Germa apparently sneaks into your dreams.
[464:31.55]Hey, Drummager!
[464:32.65]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[464:33.54]Since you don't seem to have a clue of your speed, one mile equals roughly 1600 meters.
[464:40.54]Your speed is shown in meters per second.
[464:42.68]If you multiply it by 3.6, it transfers to kilometers per hour.
[464:46.09]For reference, sound of speed in the air is around 343 meters per second.
[464:51.01]You are basically slamming into a planet twice that speed.
[465:00.16]Well, it only took me eight hours straight of playing Asura's Wrath to find out that I could regain health by hitting A. Didn't even need it.
[465:08.97]Beat the fucking game on hard.
[465:10.85]It's all good.
[465:14.35]But thank you, though.
[465:17.09]And then we had PlankCat gave 1,500 bits.
[465:19.21]Thank you for the $15, PlankCat.
[465:23.11]I love your unbridled curiosity.
[465:25.49]It's perfect for this game.
[465:26.81]This game is really cool for the one reason because you don't really have anything to do.
[465:33.19]You do, but you don't.
[465:35.32]I like that aspect of just kind of doing anything you want without a real goal.
[465:42.24]You just have this overarching thing that you're trying to figure out, but you don't have like an A to B. You just go anywhere. ...
[465:53.99]I don't like the forced reset, but I understand it.
[465:57.27]I think the forced reset, at least for me, is sort of... tells you, alright, hey, uh, you had some fun, now do something else.
[466:05.05]It's almost like you have a time limit to... it's good for me.
[466:08.77]Because I get so fucked up, and I'll get stuck on a planet for like three hours.
[466:14.00]So, it helps me just be like, alright, here comes the supernova, what are you doing tomorrow?
[466:26.39]It's good for ADHD, yeah.
[466:27.55]Because it makes me have to do something else.
[466:29.37]I think it would be better if you had a kill me button.
[466:39.23]Yeah, I mean, it's kind of dark and morbid, I guess, but they really probably should be, like, I just rip the mask off the button if you, like, hold left trigger and right trigger for, like, five seconds.
[466:51.50]So you can just, like, instead of having to quit main menu restart.
[466:57.47]I feel like that takes you out of the experience.
[467:06.21]I'd rather be able to just rip the mask off and just delete it, and just go to the next day.
[467:13.96]But, uh, yeah.
[467:18.04]It is, it is a lot of fun so far.
[467:20.28]I'm gonna be sad when it's over.
[467:21.38]Potion Dweller, thanks for 250.
[467:24.24]Derma, great stream as always.
[467:25.28]Just wanted to say that the elevator crush death summed up everything so perfectly about this playthrough.
[467:29.15]It was wonderful.
[467:37.31]Mark my words, pal.
[467:38.21]I'll try.
[467:38.51]I'll try.
[467:38.77]Also keep in mind, the Tony Hawk Underground stream might happen on Saturday.
[468:07.05]Oh, sorry.
[468:07.87]Yes, Friday.
[468:08.91]Right?
[468:09.33]Friday or Saturday, because I still have to wait for that 360 hard drive to get in.
[468:13.86]And it's in the mail, so it might take another day.
[468:16.40]I don't know.
[468:18.16]It will happen this week, though, before I leave.
[468:20.06]Hopefully it comes in over the next day or so.
[468:31.53]But let's get the community subs and the regular subs and the credit subs...
[468:39.14]All of them.
[468:42.73]Going at the same time.
[468:46.55]Here come the credits.
[468:47.07]Here comes the janitor.
[468:51.92]Gonna bump you.
[468:55.26]What is Jerma's favorite Beyonce song?
[468:57.12]Single Ladies.
[468:58.32]Easy.
[468:58.74]It's the easiest question I've had all night.
[469:02.52]Thanks everybody for subbing.
[469:08.14]uh out of wiles is a lot of fun I look forward to completing it and seeing what happens let's run the credits I can't believe I you know the thing I'm most annoyed about tonight
[469:31.48]the fact that I was like almost I was more than a half a second behind every event that happened on screen for like the first three and a half hours I'm so annoyed by that all good though won't happen tomorrow
[469:51.82]Alright, we do have a little bit more to do.
[469:53.42]We have some more bits to do.
[469:55.08]Not really.
[469:56.04]That is the best space game ever made.
[469:57.38]Uh, Prey and Thief are the same game in my brain.
[469:58.86]And... I don't know why.
[470:22.11]Is there a reason why that is?
[470:28.65]I'm just being honest.
[470:30.18]I don't know why that is.
[470:30.98]They're not even the same at all.
[470:34.50]Yeah, I don't know why that's happening.
[470:46.49]Yeah, put it on the list.
[470:48.74]The OG Thief games are good.
[470:50.48]Fuck the new one.
[470:51.32]Really?
[470:51.64]Okay.
[470:51.96]I'll play Prey, yeah.
[470:54.62]Let's go.
[470:58.66]Prey is basically a current-gen remake of System Shock 2, which was made by the same studio as Thief.
[471:03.57]Oh, maybe that's why I'm doing that.
[471:10.45]Put it on the list.
[471:12.69]Dark Soul, thanks for the $2.50.
[471:14.79]Do you have any good awful local commercials to share?
[471:17.39]Here's one of my favorites.
[471:19.44]Awful local commercials?
[471:20.82]Two Brothers scrap metal commercial.
[471:28.84]Vicki, what do I do with all this scrap metal?
[471:31.42]Dad, what should Jan do with all her scrap metal?
[471:34.92]Just tell her to call Two Brothers Scrap Metal.
[471:37.90]Got scrap?
[471:38.68]Call Two Brothers Scrap Metal and recycle your aluminum, copper, brass, steel, or any scrap metal for the highest price.
[471:44.28]Two Brothers also provides residential and commercial pickup.
[471:47.15]Why would you have this much scrap metal?
[471:48.43]Drum handling, radio dispatch lift trucks, and free roll-off service.
[471:52.07]Recycling makes sense.
[471:56.07]Just because?
[471:57.01]Why would you have a ton of scrap metal in your house?
[472:03.62]I mean, not really local commercials, but anything with Kathy Mitchell is like an automatic A-plus commercial for me or infomercial.
[472:10.86]Hi, Kathy Mitchell here with the Super Cooker.
[472:13.52]I love her so much.
[472:17.46]You guys like seriously don't know.
[472:19.52]I am a huge fan of Kathy Mitchell.
[472:21.82]I'm a huge fan.
[472:24.66]If me and Kathy Mitchell were in the same room at a convention, I would get nervous and I'd be taken aback.
[472:30.73]Oh, it's Kathy Mitchell.
[472:33.19]She wouldn't have talked to me.
[472:39.29]I would want Kathy Mitchell's autograph and a photo.
[472:43.04]And it would be a great day.
[472:45.26]I'd feel so happy.
[472:46.14]I'd be like, I got to meet Kathy Mitchell today.
[472:48.56]No way.
[472:49.14]Okay.
[472:52.71]She's the dump cakes lady, yeah.
[472:54.83]She's been around for a long time.
[472:57.45]The new wave oven.
[473:00.17]The pasta pro.
[473:02.89]Dump cakes, dump meals.
[473:04.67]She does it all.
[473:05.21]I'm going to do you all a favor.
[473:12.89]Go to YouTube and just watch the new wave oven infomercial with Kathy Mitchell and you will
[473:22.92]Just absolutely adore everything that she does.
[473:26.68]She's just wonderful.
[473:30.60]Watch it now.
[473:31.36]That's like a 30-minute infomercial.
[473:32.90]I'm not watching it right now.
[473:33.82]I'm getting out of here.
[473:34.72]I'm going to get food and pee for the first time in eight hours.
[473:40.08]But we have one more bit donation to do in this big one.
[473:42.92]$25.
[473:42.94]2,500 bits from Lizard Amiibo.
[473:45.78]Thanks for the 25 bucks.
[473:53.93]I was going to use this money to feed my 10 starving children, but decided you could probably use it more.
[473:58.74]Don't read this part out loud.
[473:59.86]Okay.
[474:08.04]Oh, no.
[474:08.76]Okay.
[474:09.53]So... No, it's all good.
[474:12.35]I'm talking about the doctor appointment I had.
[474:15.47]So basically how it goes is I probably just have
[474:24.08]a costochondritis it is just an inflammation in my rib cage to where they connect in the front of the sternum and in the back of the spine unfortunately there is no there's nothing you can do about it there's only one thing you can really do about costochondritis hope it goes away on its own which it does for a lot of people sometimes it takes six months sometimes it takes 10 years but it can go away
[474:49.99]Or you do physical therapy to try to correct it, to try to alleviate some of the pain and the symptoms.
[474:56.93]That's another route.
[474:58.43]The other route is to get a nerve blocking injection into my ribs in like six or five or six places around the spots where it hurts.
[475:08.79]And then it's gone.
[475:10.53]But you may have to do that injection more than once.
[475:14.55]You may have to do those injections every three or four months.
[475:19.45]I was told some people get an injection or two or three or four, and it goes away forever, and it never comes back.
[475:27.40]I've also been told by the same doctor that for some people, the pain comes back in like a month, and you have to do it again.
[475:38.46]So, I am going to be doing physical therapy.
[475:43.33]I don't like the idea of going right jump of the gun and blocking nerves with injections.
[475:50.29]I don't want to do that yet.
[475:52.04]If I have to, I will, but I want to do physical therapy first.
[475:56.74]That's the plan.
[475:58.02]And that's sort of what this whole thing has turned out to be.
[476:03.84]Like, it makes a lot of sense because I can lean back and I can put a little pressure on my chest.
[476:10.48]And if I lean back, the middle of my chest and sternum just pop, pop, pop, pop, hurt, hurt, hurt.
[476:16.44]Same thing if I lean to the left or right, I can feel it in the back of my ribs, the way my ribs connect to my spine.
[476:21.54]It's like, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[476:23.82]So.
[476:25.88]And that's also another reason why I haven't done
[476:29.15]green screen stuff yet I just need to get the okay and it's like okay now turning doesn't hurt and leaning back and forward doesn't hurt you know I'm saying just trying to get to that point so costochondritis inflammation in my rib cage where they connect don't know why I have it it is due
[476:56.91]But that's pretty much how that story goes.
[477:02.49]The good thing is I've had a lot of tests.
[477:05.86]I've had spinal MRIs.
[477:07.84]I've had abdominal MRIs.
[477:09.24]They've looked at all my organs.
[477:10.34]They've had tons of tests.
[477:11.52]They've checked all my fucking kidneys and my liver.
[477:16.03]Everything seems to be in working order.
[477:19.42]So, I've been told that this is not a serious condition.
[477:24.26]It's just one that you have now.
[477:26.13]It's all good.
[477:35.71]And with that, that's where we're going to end the stream tonight.
[477:39.81]Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[477:41.33]See you tomorrow around 2-ish, 1 to 2-ish, probably 2 p.m.
[477:45.79]Pacific.
[477:47.26]For more.
[477:48.45]Outer.
[477:49.48]Miles.
