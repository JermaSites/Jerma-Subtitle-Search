[ve:60.16.100]

[00:08.06]Are you even going to give them five seconds to watch the intro?
[00:11.78]No, they can watch.
[00:12.48]Do you have an intro?
[00:13.86]Yeah, I have like little like the solar system thing.
[00:17.86]Oh.
[00:18.20]Do you not have an intro to your stream?
[00:21.06]I mean, I have a starting soon screen like yours.
[00:23.08]I thought you meant like an intro, like an actual like animated like intro that some people have like.
[00:27.55]Oh, no, no.
[00:28.47]Like a special thing.
[00:30.25]No, I just mean the starting soon screen.
[00:34.39]No, I have a fantastic one that would make anyone jealous.
[00:39.35]You got a pretty good one, don't you?
[00:41.09]Yeah, I do.
[00:44.67]Actually, I have a streaming question for you.
[00:45.95]Sure.
[00:48.39]How long in minutes, when you hit the go live button on your OBS, you press the button, when does your stream start?
[01:02.16]Okay, I'm here, I'm talking, and now we're going to do the thing.
[01:04.74]How many minutes go by?
[01:08.35]Wait, wait, wait.
[01:09.07]From start of the stream to start playing the game?
[01:12.00]Like, you press the start streaming button until you're talking.
[01:14.80]Like, you're here.
[01:15.54]Until you talk.
[01:16.36]Right.
[01:17.32]Okay.
[01:18.10]I have this really weird issue where I'll turn on my stream, and the moment my stream goes on, I remember, like, three or four things that I wanted to do.
[01:25.55]Yep.
[01:27.13]And then I do them.
[01:28.57]Okay.
[01:28.87]And they are, they are totally unrelated to the stream.
[01:31.81]Like, I can't even remember what it was.
[01:33.24]One day I turned on my stream and I was like, oh wait, yeah, I got to go get the hammer and like do like, and I just started like setting up some, I have no.
[01:39.82]Wait, you were setting up like a DIY project?
[01:43.00]I don't know.
[01:43.52]I can't remember.
[01:44.40]I just know that when the stream goes on, I instantly into my brain is like, hold on.
[01:51.04]Now would be a great time to do this thing you had not thought of in a week.
[01:56.71]weird how that happens your brain just kind of goes yeah do this thing there's no other opportunity for you to do it so it depends if I'm doing a byi project or I don't know people saying like five minutes Monday Monday is tomorrow wait what's today I thought today was Monday today's Monday oh bro today's Sunday
[02:22.37]I went to work and everything.
[02:25.51]I showed I showed up at the office and nobody was clocked in.
[02:28.82]Everyone was looking at me.
[02:33.32]Yes, we are pretending we're aware we're a little early.
[02:36.22]I but we meant Monday in Australia.
[02:42.15]I think that we didn't get that point across Monday in Australia so sorry we forgot to add that uh part to the end of the uh stream uh yesterday here's the tangent okay so go you go off on your tangent before we get started we finished streaming yesterday yep oh yesterday was rough
[03:04.04]We were jumping over the lava.
[03:05.56]There was a Malenia.
[03:06.86]There was a lot of issues yesterday, to be honest.
[03:08.88]Sure.
[03:09.28]I think it was full of issues.
[03:10.62]Barely a minute went by after the stream ended and Strippin messaged me on Discord.
[03:14.93]He said, yo, great stream, man.
[03:16.47]It's really refreshing watching you suck at ass at a game.
[03:20.69]Looking forward to the next one.
[03:27.53]Soul crushing.
[03:29.82]So today we got to do better and be better.
[03:31.68]No, no, no, no, no.
[03:32.46]Strippen won't enjoy it.
[03:34.30]So your goal today is to make sure that Strippen does not enjoy the stream.
[03:37.63]I want him to be bored out of his fucking mind watching my stream.
[03:41.61]I want him to be like, God, he was actually good.
[03:43.81]He was just holding back.
[03:47.29]But isn't it?
[03:47.73]Hold on.
[03:48.50]But isn't it more fun?
[03:50.00]We just kind of don't care.
[03:54.00]Isn't it more fun that way?
[03:55.04]Look, I got really mad last night.
[03:57.86]If that's how you feel, then yeah.
[03:59.48]Why did you care so much fighting Malenia?
[04:01.40]Well, because I hate Malenia, okay?
[04:05.10]I hate Malenia.
[04:07.78]There's a difference.
[04:09.06]It's the only time during that... Okay, how many randomizer streams have we done?
[04:14.57]This would be the fourth one.
[04:16.27]This would be number four.
[04:17.65]Stream number four.
[04:19.69]I'm sorry, but if I roll up and somebody I don't like is there, I don't want to be there.
[04:26.64]I want to go somewhere else.
[04:32.14]That's what we should have done.
[04:34.69]that's what we should have done like but you went into gamer mode one you walk in the door and you say it's Malenia we should have been like oh well we can go anywhere else but remember we didn't have the the key and the rune we got really lucky at the last 20 minutes of stream last night because we went somewhere else we didn't get lucky we did what we should have done like hours prior yeah but alright so why did you keep going in the fog door then
[04:59.36]I wanted to beat her.
[05:00.30]Right.
[05:01.08]Because the chat's like, oh, you walked away, dude.
[05:05.16]No, it's a strong force.
[05:09.02]You know how many times I was seriously, we were walking in the fog door and I'm like, let's just fuck this.
[05:13.01]Let's do something else.
[05:14.51]And it doesn't matter.
[05:16.13]Yep.
[05:16.49]You talked me out of summons.
[05:18.17]I would rather abandon ship and go do something else than like walk into Malenia's room with like a squad of guys.
[05:27.09]There's just something wrong there.
[05:30.61]You would rather not beat the thing than beat the thing.
[05:35.57]That's so funny.
[05:37.43]There's a full circle of weird... I'm thinking if this explanation is worth it.
[05:43.83]Okay.
[05:44.79]Okay.
[05:44.97]Because I was just talking about it, actually.
[05:46.87]There's this show on Netflix that just came out a couple days ago called Physique 100 or something, where it's all of the top bodybuilders and Olympic gold winners in Korea.
[05:56.97]are doing like squid, squid game style, like strength tests to like find the perfect body.
[06:04.52]Like it's a real competition.
[06:05.92]What?
[06:07.74]Yeah, so they got like 100 people all super fit and they're doing like just, you know, like a fitness competition basically.
[06:14.16]But it's all dubbed.
[06:15.36]Also, it's hilariously dubbed.
[06:17.26]I was laughing nonstop.
[06:19.60]The shit that they say and the voice actors are like so not into it and don't have context.
[06:24.22]Hilarious the whole way through.
[06:25.60]Okay.
[06:26.82]But spoiler alert for the physique 100.
[06:29.68]Spoiler alert.
[06:30.56]Wait, wait, wait.
[06:31.36]Don't... Okay, before you do this, should I just, like, mute you?
[06:34.85]Or leave?
[06:36.05]Should I take it in my hand?
[06:36.69]Because it sounds like I might want to watch this.
[06:38.13]Well, I need to tell you.
[06:39.51]So you have to spoil the show.
[06:40.61]There's only two episodes out so far.
[06:42.37]It's not all out.
[06:43.09]Alright, so it's not, like, a huge... It's kind of a minor spoiler.
[06:44.89]It's a minor... I thought you meant, like, oh, this is, like, a 10 episode, 20 episodes, and this is, like, the last... No, I'm not going to, like... The people...
[06:53.68]Like the first real competition that matters, the winners from like the first thing get to like choose who their opponent is.
[07:02.64]so they've got a hundred people and then there's like you know a bunch of like super buff guys and then there's also women in the competition and it's like a wrestling competition basically and they can just pick women and it's really up and my wife is like why is this allowed and then there's one guy that's like yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna wrestle that woman
[07:24.92]And everyone's like, what the fuck?
[07:26.72]So what I'm saying is, you can choose to walk into Malenia's room with a squad of goons, but come on, man.
[07:33.88]Like, you really shouldn't be.
[07:35.80]Like, everyone else there has, like, a level of decency where they didn't go there.
[07:41.07]But you're picking, like, fair opponents to look good.
[07:44.09]But here's the problem with your argument on this.
[07:47.59]Malenia is fucking unstoppable.
[07:51.87]I beat her in my run.
[07:53.87]But the point, to your point, is Millenia will wipe the floor with a hundred of us.
[08:00.93]That's not true.
[08:06.20]Is it?
[08:10.42]Jerma, play Guilty Gear.
[08:11.53]Right now?
[08:15.01]Oh, yeah, let's do Guilty Gear.
[08:19.69]Dude, it could be... It could be... It doesn't matter.
[08:22.46]It could be like a bug.
[08:24.76]It could be a single insect, a single ant in that room.
[08:28.80]If it is an insanely difficult, strong enemy, why do you... We're going to get our ass kicked regardless.
[08:37.62]It doesn't matter.
[08:39.48]But then you're going to look twice as bad.
[08:41.38]If the single ant has the waterfowl move, it doesn't matter.
[08:46.64]We were dodging it.
[08:51.52]So we were getting there.
[08:54.78]Real life isn't video games.
[08:59.73]A single egg will slaughter us.
[09:01.85]Why are summons in the game in all caps?
[09:05.55]I understand.
[09:06.43]I understand your point.
[09:08.01]But when you play Elden Ring, it's not in front of an audience that like, you know, it's a different scenario.
[09:16.10]Like, yeah, would I wrestle with a girl in the mud?
[09:19.77]Sure, but on TV, when I can choose muscular men.
[09:25.54]What the fuck is he talking about?
[09:27.62]What is he talking about?
[09:30.26]What is he going on?
[09:31.04]What is happening, right?
[09:31.78]What is he saying?
[09:33.75]You have to see the show, okay?
[09:35.35]What is he saying?
[09:38.83]So this is like directly tied to this show on Netflix.
[09:43.91]Yeah.
[09:44.55]Okay.
[09:44.76]So what he's saying is I have to see this show.
[09:49.67]Well, yeah.
[09:50.31]And then you would agree that you shouldn't mud wrestle with women.
[09:54.48]Only muscular men.
[09:57.26]I don't even know what the context of what you're... I need to see the show.
[09:59.48]Well, you're going to watch the show at some point.
[10:01.14]Yeah.
[10:01.32]Alright.
[10:03.48]Are you ready to fucking smoke a blunt with Placidusax or what?
[10:07.88]I don't have that mod.
[10:13.89]You said you'd be back Monday.
[10:14.91]You're liars.
[10:15.93]Well, look, I was asleep last night and I woke up in the middle of the night and I had just like, I had like laser eyes.
[10:25.97]Like, I was like, we got to beat it.
[10:29.84]I can't wait.
[10:30.98]I just was like, hey, sir, you're not doing side content.
[10:33.82]We're going or what are we doing?
[10:36.86]No, we're just doing what we want.
[10:39.10]Okay.
[10:39.50]Okay.
[10:39.80]I thought the laser eyes meant like we have to continue fucking smash, smashing our head against millennium.
[10:45.22]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[10:46.16]I never want to go.
[10:47.20]If there's a bazooka mod and we can install it and we can just shoot a bazooka at her and it's like 5,000 damage, we'll do that.
[10:51.86]Okay.
[10:54.00]I'm sure someone has made that.
[10:55.00]Alright.
[10:56.68]You good?
[10:58.52]Are we good to get started?
[10:59.52]Are you in the game?
[11:00.14]Yeah.
[11:00.54]I'm loading up the game.
[11:01.70]I'm loading up the game.
[11:02.64]I'm continuing.
[11:03.60]I'm loading up the game.
[11:05.12]You already made that joke?
[11:06.14]I made that joke in pre-stream.
[11:07.82]I'm sorry, but it was like... It's not a joke.
[11:10.86]There were like 15 people that were there.
[11:14.82]He's not joking.
[11:16.26]Guys, I use pre-stream as kind of like, oh, was this funny?
[11:19.51]Because they go, ha ha ha, and then I'm like, I got it.
[11:21.39]I'm going to use that on the stream.
[11:23.13]How lame would that be if you went to a stand-up comics show and they're doing a show before people get in the room and then they just do the show again?
[11:35.45]That's called rehearsal.
[11:38.23]That's dress rehearsal.
[11:39.91]Okay.
[11:41.13]They do that on, like, every major television show.
[11:43.23]How lame would it be if, like, you pay... Oh, you go to New York City, and they're, like, doing a, like, theater.
[11:49.40]And they're doing... They, like, rehearse for it?
[11:52.08]Can't they just, like...
[11:54.24]Can't they just come out and do it?
[11:55.48]Hey, I've never been to a taping of SNL, but I'm pretty sure that they do dress rehearsal on SNL before they go live.
[12:04.73]So they actually, I think they do that on SNL.
[12:08.45]So it's all fake.
[12:09.93]Sorry.
[12:13.03]It's all fake.
[12:14.39]But SNL sucks.
[12:15.65]I didn't say I watched it.
[12:21.63]You got your thing down?
[12:25.89]Yeah, hold on.
[12:28.49]My controller is not working.
[12:30.38]My controller is not working.
[12:32.24]What the heck?
[12:35.54]Oh, you can't see.
[12:36.14]Sorry.
[12:37.30]My left bumper is not doing anything.
[12:41.80]I can't block.
[12:44.93]Plug it in.
[12:46.71]Plug it in.
[12:47.11]I'm plugging it in.
[12:48.39]I'm unplugging.
[12:49.01]Okay, I just looked at this and I...
[12:56.14]At some point in our rage yesterday, I changed weapons to the pizza cutter.
[13:02.79]I'm like, where is my fire sword?
[13:05.53]Where did that go?
[13:07.97]I'm looking at this going, why do I have this equipped?
[13:10.16]And I'm like, wait, that's right.
[13:12.20]I've rage respect to fight Malenia.
[13:17.52]This thing's still going.
[13:19.67]Did you break it?
[13:21.01]I don't know.
[13:21.79]It's only one button, dude.
[13:34.78]SNL is funny.
[13:35.53]You and Chad are not as funny and jealous crying.
[13:37.73]I haven't watched an episode of SNL in at least 5 to 10 years.
[13:50.12]I've never watched one.
[13:53.06]You know what I think is really funny though is that like...
[13:56.41]like news websites will report on what happened on SNL.
[14:00.16]Like it's new.
[14:01.70]Yeah.
[14:01.94]Like SNL's take on like this political situation.
[14:05.32]Did you see it last night?
[14:06.24]It's like, fuck you.
[14:11.20]Do some journalism.
[14:14.10]Fuck you.
[14:20.24]That's, that's, you know, that's so funny because it's like,
[14:27.88]I feel like reporting on something that was already reported, that was reported through a satire kind of website or something, that kind of happens too, doesn't it?
[14:37.59]It's like, don't people eat the onion all the time?
[14:40.67]Oh, yeah, they do eat the onion.
[14:47.77]People do news reports on tweets.
[14:51.43]Yeah.
[14:54.02]I remember the first time I did see, like,
[14:57.38]they used the tweet and they were talking about it on like a news piece and I was like what the hell is going on nothing that happens on Twitter is real it's all made up are you joining I didn't know I thought you said you were I thought you're having controller problems no I mean I'm I'm in the game I can live with it it's just the block button you're not allowed to even actually like block anything in this game
[15:24.69]I mean, Malenia would destroy me.
[15:26.49]They did surgery on a grape, bro.
[15:28.50]What?
[15:30.24]I'm going to look in my closet for my bonus controller.
[15:35.36]Where did I end?
[15:36.12]Oh, there you are.
[15:38.96]Alright, so let's give a recap.
[15:42.50]We just got a huge raid from RT.
[15:44.82]RT game, what's up?
[15:45.84]What's going on, RT?
[15:49.33]Hope everything's going well.
[15:50.13]Hope you had a good stream.
[15:51.61]RT is awesome.
[15:52.37]You don't follow RT.
[15:53.12]What are you, dumb?
[15:57.14]What was RT doing?
[16:01.42]What were you doing, RT?
[16:08.83]Persona?
[16:10.55]Persona 5.
[16:10.83]Cool.
[16:14.49]Join us in following RT game.
[16:16.69]Wait, what?
[16:17.15]This is like a new feature.
[16:18.73]You can... Wait, what is that?
[16:19.81]This is a new feature where you can like... That's kind of cool.
[16:24.77]I didn't know you could do that.
[16:26.65]It's cool.
[16:27.03]Whoa.
[16:27.77]That's actually really cool.
[16:34.73]Ster, do you like the Persona games?
[16:36.11]I feel like you might be one of those like... Persona fans.
[16:40.92]You just call me a fucking weeb.
[16:49.76]no it's supposed to have to be very like compelling characters and gameplay and story and I don't think I celebrated like RPG franchises I can't say that I've played any game that takes you like 400 hours to beat oh and you could have just said no
[17:16.75]Oh, Jermis getting defensive.
[17:18.65]Uh-oh.
[17:19.51]I just wanted to alienate probably like, you know, like 50% of the people listening.
[17:23.06]I have to... Let me be really honest, though.
[17:24.56]I have to... Let's put all the cards on the table.
[17:28.08]I have opened every Persona game that's come to Game Pass.
[17:33.10]Game Pass again.
[17:34.10]And after like 30 or 40 minutes, I just kind of close it.
[17:40.65]Every single one of them.
[17:43.39]It's not that I don't like it.
[17:44.37]I'm just like...
[17:46.47]yeah I don't like it I can say that I'm not on contract with the persona devs I played the the fighting game persona 4 arena I like that game alright so here's what's happening it's been 15 minutes we had our relaxing session but you have a limit of 15 that's why you asked earlier so you could you could set a limit um
[18:14.17]What?
[18:14.53]No more talking.
[18:15.53]Alright, listen to me very carefully.
[18:18.01]You, like, literally just brought up the topic, do you like Arena, Persona 4?
[18:23.50]And then I got...
[18:25.19]You got very angry.
[18:26.65]We didn't even get to talk about it really in depth.
[18:29.95]And then you cut it off and you're like, fine.
[18:31.67]He didn't like it.
[18:32.53]So, like, we're not talking.
[18:36.09]Silence.
[18:36.43]Dude, you can't convince me to like Persona.
[18:39.03]That was that scenario.
[18:40.81]Dude, bro, you're not going to be able to convince me to like Persona.
[18:43.62]I said, hey, do you like the Persona?
[18:44.68]I don't like JRPGs, man.
[18:45.86]Then how am I going to see?
[18:46.92]I can't.
[18:49.25]How am I going to keep the conversation going?
[18:52.90]New conversation.
[18:53.74]If you had to pick any genre of game that you would just be incapable of enjoying, what is it for you?
[18:59.50]Strategy games.
[19:03.90]I feel that.
[19:06.59]Stuff like Crusader Kings.
[19:08.93]Oh, gosh.
[19:09.43]I just couldn't.
[19:09.89]Oh, my goodness.
[19:10.45]I couldn't play it.
[19:14.71]I feel like I used to be like that, even with StarCraft.
[19:19.52]Well, RTS is different, I think.
[19:21.46]But I mean true strategy games.
[19:23.70]They're just too much for me.
[19:25.28]They don't bore me, they just overwhelm me.
[19:29.01]Okay, so we have the manor key, and we have two runes.
[19:32.85]Alright, let's go to the manor.
[19:35.77]We can actually go into the room now.
[19:37.95]Yeah, let's go to the room.
[19:45.12]What's your favorite JRPG?
[19:48.50]Chrono Trigger.
[19:51.00]Did you play Chrono Trigger?
[19:53.60]Nope.
[19:54.18]You should.
[19:54.72]You really should.
[19:55.28]Everybody should.
[19:55.74]Everyone.
[19:57.16]That should be required rating to own a console.
[19:59.89]Or, like, a PC.
[20:02.93]You should have to do your homework.
[20:04.25]You should have to prove that you played it.
[20:06.49]Before you get, like, a console.
[20:08.01]It should literally... You know when you turn on your Xbox, and it's like, Welcome to Xbox!
[20:11.99]Set it up!
[20:12.45]What's your name?
[20:13.37]And what's your date of birth?
[20:14.47]Before that, it should... The Chrono Trigger splash screen intro should play.
[20:18.50]I would lie.
[20:20.00]No, no, no.
[20:20.34]Like, it's just baked into every console.
[20:22.30]It's like, here it is.
[20:23.80]Like, Chrono Trigger, the... And you have to play through the whole game before you can even make your account on Xbox.
[20:32.96]Even if you've already played it before.
[20:36.30]How would you prove that?
[20:37.24]I don't know.
[20:39.22]It could, like, ask you a trivia question.
[20:41.44]Oh, yeah.
[20:41.86]But no, you could look it up, though.
[20:46.55]Somebody said, why are you gatekeeping an entire generation?
[20:52.54]We just dropped the new Halo and we're so excited for you to try it.
[20:55.56]Make sure you guys finish Chrono Trigger soon if you want to be trying it.
[20:59.16]Yeah, the new Xbox just dropped, but make sure you start playing Chrono Trigger.
[21:03.47]It's going to take you at least 20 to 40 hours.
[21:07.61]What is here?
[21:08.05]There's nothing here.
[21:09.01]Are we still fucked?
[21:12.91]Don't we need an invitation or something?
[21:14.56]No, no, no.
[21:15.54]There's a secret.
[21:16.42]Oh, okay.
[21:16.84]The secret.
[21:17.22]Yep.
[21:18.76]Secret door in the back.
[21:19.70]I just got the Elden Lord helmet.
[21:24.14]What is this?
[21:24.56]Does it do anything?
[21:27.62]I don't remember.
[21:28.37]Hold on.
[21:29.81]No, I know where it is.
[21:30.35]It's over here.
[21:32.53]This is where everybody hangs out.
[21:33.49]Where you do the missions and stuff.
[21:41.93]It's like here, right?
[21:46.18]It's in the room with the girl.
[21:50.23]This one here.
[21:54.75]Other room.
[21:56.09]Other room.
[21:56.89]Wrong room.
[21:57.51]I just want to open both of these.
[21:59.43]Other room.
[22:04.29]You know what the thing about Malenia is?
[22:07.11]Because I was remembering last night.
[22:09.67]Yeah.
[22:10.85]that Malenia is in like the secret area of like the frost world right that's hard to get to and then she's in the secret or secret Haligtree that I don't even remember how you like don't you have do some weird shit to get there
[22:25.73]Yeah, I mean, it's an optional secret area.
[22:28.48]It is.
[22:28.70]Yeah, and then her whole area sucks, and then you get down there, and then it's like, okay, like, she deserves to suck.
[22:34.14]I did not hate the Hallitree area.
[22:36.96]You didn't like, you, like, really didn't like the area?
[22:40.08]I didn't, I didn't hate it.
[22:42.00]I would watch out, though.
[22:42.70]I skipped the whole area.
[22:45.53]You mean, like, you skipped it as in you never played it, or you, like, jumped off, like, a ledge and landed, like, all the way at the bottom or something?
[22:52.01]I did that.
[22:52.75]Okay.
[22:53.01]There was the elevator skip.
[22:54.61]So I didn't play most of it.
[22:55.95]And then I went back and I was like, you know, I'm curious what's in the Halle tree.
[22:58.45]Like, I want to play it like for real.
[22:59.69]And I fucking hated it.
[23:03.85]I'm sorry.
[23:04.25]I can't hear anything you're saying.
[23:09.69]It's cutting the weeds down.
[23:12.08]This is a big job.
[23:13.12]This is going to cost a little extra.
[23:15.24]I can't.
[23:17.04]I can't.
[23:18.18]I can't cast magic.
[23:24.51]Because I can't press my bumper.
[23:26.01]What did you do to your controller?
[23:32.47]Give me it's just one button.
[23:33.65]Give me a second.
[23:34.09]I have like an old Xbox 360 controller.
[23:37.96]I gotta plug it in.
[23:40.48]Old Xbox 360 and not an Xbox One controller.
[23:46.00]Oh no, it has.
[23:47.56]Well, I was on an Xbox One controller.
[23:49.31]I this thing has the fucking the weird cable in the middle.
[23:54.45]That isn't a USB, but it connects to the cable that I need.
[23:58.11]Like, you go ahead.
[23:59.51]I'm dying to poison.
[24:01.83]I know where I'm going.
[24:02.69]I'll clear it.
[24:03.66]Don't worry.
[24:06.20]It's all good.
[24:06.58]Don't worry.
[24:06.90]We're good.
[24:12.06]How's everybody doing tonight?
[24:12.96]Good?
[24:15.06]Everybody doing okay?
[24:18.61]How you been?
[24:20.53]Doing okay?
[24:20.77]Okay.
[24:27.28]Hope you're doing alright.
[24:32.74]Ster.
[24:33.06]There's blood on the ground.
[24:35.66]Ster.
[24:58.04]So you mentioned before that you don't like JRPGs.
[25:07.16]Is there a particular reason as to why?
[25:09.38]Is it too slow?
[25:10.33]Is it like Ster wants to go fast?
[25:11.85]I'm like walking around my room.
[25:13.11]Are you talking to me?
[25:14.17]Oh, sorry.
[25:14.61]No, no, no.
[25:14.93]Keep doing that.
[25:15.37]I don't have a wireless.
[25:16.87]I don't think I have another controller.
[25:18.31]I'm going to die.
[25:18.89]Wow, I really ruined that.
[25:21.61]Sorry, chat.
[25:23.67]I got his attention and he came back over.
[25:27.00]We were trying to see if you were going to die.
[25:29.96]No, I was just trying to keep you talking.
[25:31.42]I figured we would keep you distracted and you'd just bleed with poison or whatever.
[25:35.58]You found out.
[25:36.54]You were walking around your room.
[25:40.12]Yeah.
[25:41.54]So you don't have another controller?
[25:44.76]No, I would need the extra part of the cable for the other one.
[25:52.60]Is it jammed up or something?
[25:55.86]I don't know.
[25:56.32]I'm pressing it as hard as I can.
[25:58.84]I'm doing tapping.
[26:01.38]It's just my left bumper.
[26:05.58]The block button.
[26:06.60]Theoretically, you could make left trigger cast and you could do left stick.
[26:15.10]It could be block.
[26:19.22]Does that sound stupid?
[26:20.81]Because literally there's not a single reason to crouch in this game.
[26:24.15]There's not one single reason to crouch.
[26:27.15]You can just rebind in this game, right?
[26:29.55]Yeah.
[26:29.75]Like individual buttons.
[26:35.76]And if you're going to get rid of crouch versus be able to use your shield, I think that's the best place to put it.
[26:43.35]What about crouch attack?
[26:48.42]For some weapons, yeah.
[26:53.22]Anything else?
[26:59.54]What the?
[27:01.89]What?
[27:04.35]Okay.
[27:04.53]That was like a, that was like a GTA four video we made.
[27:07.95]And like, somebody just got hit by the car.
[27:09.43]Okay.
[27:10.09]So I went to go rebind my controls.
[27:12.80]So I rebound, like you said, to the stick.
[27:16.28]And then I went back up to crouch and it's like, oh, you have to like change this.
[27:18.84]It's red.
[27:19.36]So I pressed left bumper to change it.
[27:21.66]And it worked.
[27:23.60]There you go.
[27:25.18]Problem solved.
[27:25.56]Why isn't it?
[27:26.04]Why isn't it working in the game?
[27:29.87]Wait, it doesn't work.
[27:30.73]It only works on the menu.
[27:33.91]yeah what it will not work in the game I think I should like restart my game alright let's let's just like get to a bonfire and then I'm gonna restart that's that's very weird yeah that's weird oh yeah this doesn't open ah so what I forget what you end up you you go like deeper don't you or something there there's like a secret wall somewhere again
[28:08.44]This was another area that's like, why would they like hide?
[28:11.10]Change wand hands.
[28:12.60]Someone saying, hey, change wand hands.
[28:14.05]I have a shield in my hand.
[28:16.87]What?
[28:17.39]I just switched weapons and it just started.
[28:19.73]Like I already had the button down.
[28:21.31]I would.
[28:21.55]Well, that person should be.
[28:25.03]Should be commended for that.
[28:26.71]Because that.
[28:31.37]I'm going to reinstall windows.
[28:32.69]Just we need to find like a Grace to rest up.
[28:36.42]Oh, it's over here.
[28:39.03]Yeah, yeah, guys, I gotta reinstall Windows.
[28:42.29]The forums were saying this doesn't happen on Linux.
[28:47.99]Because like a Gabe Newell alt account.
[28:56.12]Dude.
[29:01.36]What is that thing?
[29:06.20]Chat.
[29:07.72]Chat, what is that?
[29:10.16]Chat chat, what is that?
[29:12.54]Oh, it's just one of those silent things.
[29:24.76]There we go.
[29:25.50]OK, banishing you, because I don't think it lets me quit the game until I banish you ahead.
[29:30.38]I restarting and I'm holding up.
[29:32.40]I'm holding everything up and it's all my fault that we're late again.
[29:38.52]No, that's not true.
[29:39.80]Yeah, in the menu I could.
[29:41.28]It would totally totally fine.
[29:42.62]Oh, just just restart the whole client.
[29:44.10]I'm just going to go right back there.
[30:00.74]I forget where that is.
[30:05.04]Here.
[30:06.16]Ster, you have a great room.
[30:07.28]Go to Landale.
[30:08.29]We're going to kill fucking Rycard.
[30:10.17]Yeah, we're going to kill Rycard.
[30:11.07]Do you like radishes?
[30:16.81]I can't remember.
[30:17.59]I feel like I've had pickled radishes as part of some Korean meal.
[30:22.01]And then like, yeah, okay.
[30:24.87]I actually prefer them just right out of the bag.
[30:28.81]Washed.
[30:29.69]Just...
[30:30.80]Are you like, is this like a Doug funny moment?
[30:32.78]We're going back to that again.
[30:33.62]Like you just eat beets, like raw.
[30:35.56]You just like grab a beet and take a chomp out.
[30:37.60]I wish I liked beets.
[30:39.34]I wish I liked to eat beets like that.
[30:41.76]They're unbelievably, that is like the most powerful super fruit in existence is a beet.
[30:49.03]But I think they're disgusting.
[30:50.81]I think they just taste like dirt.
[30:59.17]Yeah, I have no mental association with what a radish tastes like.
[31:05.53]Uh, they're kind of they're super crunchy.
[31:08.21]And when you bite into them, you get that kind of nasal heat.
[31:10.53]They're kind of spicy.
[31:11.41]Like you get that up here, like in the top of your nose.
[31:20.75]I've opened my world.
[31:22.01]I can't relate.
[31:25.86]You don't want to eat a shitload of them, but
[31:28.85]Like wasabi, yeah.
[31:31.28]It's a little less harsh than wasabi.
[31:33.16]I would say a lot less harsh than wasabi.
[31:35.88]My intestinal parasites?
[31:38.22]I'm good.
[31:38.84]I... I stared death in the eye and I won.
[31:42.54]You know what's really annoying about that conversation yesterday and about how that whole thing played out?
[31:47.34]Huh?
[31:48.48]I had diarrhea this morning.
[31:52.06]And it was just like... I was just sitting there going, fuck that guy!
[31:57.77]Fuck.
[31:58.89]It's not fair.
[31:59.75]That's what I'm saying.
[32:00.71]I got away with it.
[32:01.51]I remember sitting there just being like, you gotta be kidding me.
[32:05.37]This guy eats raw pork that's been in a backpack for a day.
[32:09.03]And like, oh, my tummy is upset this morning.
[32:11.73]I was like, what the fuck, man?
[32:15.83]Oh, hey, that's the Malenia shortcut.
[32:19.37]Okay.
[32:20.71]There it is.
[32:21.76]Yeah, now... This is the door people were telling us to open for like hours yesterday, but we didn't have the key to do it.
[32:25.76]We didn't have the key to do it.
[32:26.64]But now we need to... How do we get to... We have to do the invitation shit to do Rykar, don't we?
[32:34.30]Here.
[32:34.82]There's one way.
[32:37.39]If you're an actual god.
[32:38.63]No, you can get teleported down there.
[32:41.89]This jump.
[32:42.67]There's a teleporter that takes you down there.
[32:57.31]For one second, for one second, I thought your connection dropped and that was the last sound you made before you got kicked from the Discord.
[33:08.35]I thought you were like, ah, like, what the fuck?
[33:10.65]Like you were like, ah, and it was like, ah, it froze.
[33:13.25]I thought you froze and you just got booted and you lagged out.
[33:16.17]No, I, uh.
[33:20.14]What's the jump?
[33:20.96]How do you do it?
[33:21.88]You have to get up on top of this thing.
[33:23.78]And then you see where that, like that ledge up there, they patch this.
[33:27.27]So this is really hard to do.
[33:29.84]But you can jump from the top of this thing up to that ledge and then write cards like right up there.
[33:34.39]VR Josh, that was a great comment.
[33:36.49]Ster tabbed out of a Source Engine game.
[33:40.31]Alright, so you jump from here to up there.
[33:44.18]Okay.
[33:45.00]Yeah, but I think you have to like be running on that.
[33:46.64]So you have to like run in a circle, which is why... Bro!
[33:48.92]Got it first try!
[33:49.82]Where are we going from here?
[33:50.80]That's not the hard part.
[33:51.80]Oh.
[33:53.40]Now where?
[33:53.66]You have to get on top of the metal circle.
[33:55.78]Okay.
[33:57.53]And then you have to be able to jump to the ledge.
[34:03.75]He's killing it tonight.
[34:06.36]Now, guide me a little more.
[34:07.74]I forget exactly what you're aiming for, but you need to land on the ledge so you can get up to that high ground.
[34:21.07]That's the chat saying it's almost impossible.
[34:24.57]It is possible.
[34:30.16]Dude, I... We have switched bodies.
[34:32.50]I don't fucking... Just wait.
[34:37.42]Just wait.
[34:37.66]I'll get it.
[34:38.63]Strippen is eating right now.
[34:48.41]Okay.
[34:49.41]What is that?
[34:51.63]Okay.
[34:52.33]Strippen is eating right now?
[34:55.15]Like, he's like, I was trying to be better so he wouldn't enjoy me being bad.
[34:59.88]And I've jumped off the map twice in like 10 minutes of gameplay.
[35:04.72]So right now, Strippin, you tell, Strippin just took a big bite out of like a fucking steak and cheese or whatever he's eating.
[35:09.58]And he's probably just like, he's like laughing and like food just came out of his mouth.
[35:13.50]Yeah, we're not going to, I don't want to sit around and do this jump.
[35:16.95]It's, you're not getting it.
[35:18.49]Is it actually patched up?
[35:19.55]It's patched, it's patched, it's patched.
[35:20.97]Oh.
[35:21.45]it is patched but it is possible but it's incredibly incredibly okay so the the number one question is where here's our two options let's go fight Malenia no no no there are there I there's a way to get down to that no no there's a way to get down to ricard you get ported there without having to do anything I know it I've done it accidentally before
[35:47.81]How do you get down to that room?
[35:49.25]The one right before Rykar.
[35:50.61]There's a way to get down there.
[35:52.48]It's part of a quest.
[35:54.50]You can't do the quest... Okay.
[35:56.50]The envelopes.
[35:57.36]Okay.
[35:59.80]Let's go kill Millenia.
[36:00.58]Fine.
[36:01.70]Alright.
[36:02.20]Oh my god, dude.
[36:03.72]We're doing this... We're attempting this one time, and then we are... I'm telling you right now, I am immediately porting.
[36:10.51]to one Malenia fight one Malenia fight and then we are and I'm talking about where I'm porting to uh outside of landell yeah we're gonna go do land though you understand the terms here right yeah you get the terms um yes also do I have a way to turn in the other I got mogs room do we have the tower so we can go to the top I forgot which one is mogs set away
[36:37.30]Because I know we have access to one weird tower.
[36:40.50]For everybody saying, like, how do they not know this?
[36:43.10]You guys have to understand.
[36:43.90]You have to remember.
[36:44.86]There is, like, an entire human history worth of stuff in this game.
[36:49.88]It's like an entire human history with, like, lore books and, like, thousands of pieces of documents.
[36:57.52]It's a lot.
[36:58.94]So we don't remember.
[37:15.03]Come on, bring it on.
[37:34.11]Okay, be careful.
[37:37.37]Pretty clean.
[38:21.05]Not bad, pretty good.
[38:24.17]Not good.
[38:26.67]A little cautious.
[38:28.94]That's why.
[38:29.54]Dude, her fight should be in a room with pillars.
[38:37.46]Actually kind of should be.
[38:38.16]Like her actual fight.
[39:07.42]Oh fuck.
[39:08.82]Oh fuck!
[39:10.06]That was the worst time.
[39:16.92]so so
[40:09.37]Just hit her.
[40:11.43]I can't!
[40:27.73]Just press the attack button once, dude.
[40:29.90]What's the problem?
[40:31.06]Dude, you're not allowed to play this video game against this character with a weapon that's less than like a tenth of a second swing time.
[40:37.42]Might as well just come in here with a dagger.
[40:43.88]Thank you.
[41:11.82]Uh.
[41:13.94]Dude.
[41:14.98]You can't attack Millenia with a weapon that is two-handed strength.
[41:18.76]You just can't.
[41:21.55]If I hit R1, I'd die.
[41:24.73]I'd die if I hit R1.
[41:31.57]Let me hit R1.
[41:32.20]Dead.
[41:33.82]There's no opportunity, man.
[41:43.68]They give you enough opportunity to swing with a katana.
[41:45.84]They made that character for katanas only.
[41:48.06]Hey, don't you have a moon veil you were going to give me?
[41:52.04]I did, didn't I?
[41:53.54]Yeah.
[41:54.58]Jump attack?
[41:56.74]If it takes too long.
[41:57.51]No, you should jump attack.
[42:05.31]Don't you have multiple fully upgraded two-handers?
[42:08.67]They nerfed it a bit, but dual-wielding two-handers and doing jump attacks on her is actually pretty good.
[42:16.69]And then I have a claw talisman for bonus on jump attacks.
[42:20.94]Let's do it again.
[42:23.44]Okay.
[42:23.70]Are we changing anything?
[42:26.24]No, I got it.
[42:26.62]You want the talisman?
[42:27.40]Are you going to give me the moon veil?
[42:28.84]I got the jump attack.
[42:33.02]Didn't I give you the moon veil?
[42:34.18]I thought I gave it to you.
[42:36.35]Did you?
[42:37.93]Yeah.
[42:38.93]Wasn't I like, oh, look, look, look.
[42:40.05]And you're like, oh, yeah, yeah.
[42:42.13]I think I told you not to give it to me.
[42:44.74]How come I don't?
[42:45.18]Did I sell it?
[42:46.30]Oh, no, I have it.
[42:47.20]Okay.
[42:47.56]Well, it's like not upgraded.
[42:49.86]Wait, Moonveil has bleed on it?
[42:51.96]I think so, yeah.
[42:53.56]Why?
[43:03.51]That's why it's easy mode.
[43:06.37]I never knew how to bleed.
[43:07.85]No, let's get out of here.
[43:09.07]I'm getting out of here.
[43:09.85]How do I get out of here quick?
[43:11.75]You have a somber five.
[43:13.15]I went to capital rampart.
[43:14.01]Go.
[43:14.17]Do you have a somber five?
[43:15.78]Yeah.
[43:16.18]No, we're fighting her one more time.
[43:17.22]No, no, no.
[43:17.94]Do it now.
[43:18.68]No.
[43:19.22]Get me out of here.
[43:20.80]Alright.
[43:21.44]Okay, we just lost it.
[43:22.54]I was like, fucking this, fucking that, fucking this, fucking that.
[43:25.74]No, no, no.
[43:26.26]Get me out of here.
[43:27.02]We just need to look at some levels.
[43:28.44]Get me out of here.
[43:31.64]Somber five.
[43:37.81]I'll give you a somber five.
[43:39.67]Get me out of here.
[43:41.07]There's no way I'm... There's no way we're going to sit there for like another two hours where I just continue.
[43:46.20]Every time we lose, I'm going to pull... Here's what I'm going to do.
[43:48.98]I'm going to say exactly what's going to happen.
[43:50.36]I'm going to grab this.
[43:51.88]This is coming up here.
[43:52.72]And I'm going to talk like this.
[43:54.60]Really, really angrily.
[43:57.42]Like, I'm very... This is... Look at how intent this is.
[44:00.48]Somber five.
[44:02.77]Somber five, daddy.
[44:03.63]Daddy, somber five.
[44:06.07]Listen to me.
[44:09.43]How many do you need?
[44:10.93]Just one?
[44:11.39]Just one.
[44:14.25]Do you have an eight?
[44:20.55]An eight and an ancient.
[44:22.79]I have an eight.
[44:24.09]I do not have an ancient.
[44:25.67]Give me the eight.
[44:28.38]You've taken all these from me.
[44:29.94]I've given you like so much.
[44:31.38]Yeah, but these are so much more valuable and you've taken them.
[44:34.60]We, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we.
[44:38.26]let's go to the road the manor real quick okay are you doing are you upgrading moonville yeah no I don't like this arc you don't like this arc I've been using a fucking long sword all game you have gone through like six weapons you upgraded the finger you upgraded geese's wheel hey where is my finger by the way I want that shit back oh I'm taking up all the sombers this is like the first time
[45:03.89]Hey.
[45:05.07]Hey.
[45:05.45]I'm getting you your fucking finger.
[45:07.43]Wait, everyone relax.
[45:08.41]No, no.
[45:12.19]What's going to happen?
[45:13.35]You can do this, but not right now.
[45:15.33]And I'll tell you why.
[45:16.09]Because you're going to upgrade this.
[45:18.09]You're going to do R1, L2, L2.
[45:19.73]And you're going to go, alright, let's go fighter again.
[45:24.07]No, we're going to go do Lando.
[45:26.57]No, you're going to want to take that to Malenia.
[45:28.41]I know it.
[45:30.03]I don't.
[45:44.47]Oh, let's go.
[45:46.69]Millenia?
[45:47.79]No, I'm fucking I haven't even upgraded a plus one yet.
[45:50.69]Entertain yourself for a moment, dear.
[45:52.31]OK, fine.
[46:05.58]I've actually never used Moonvale.
[46:07.80]It's so good, it's unbelievably good.
[46:09.30]Do you have a nine?
[46:12.52]I do not.
[46:14.05]Okay, if I just need nine in Ancient, it would be max.
[46:16.25]I don't even think I'm going to use it until it's maxed.
[46:23.74]I wish I could just slide off.
[46:53.74]Why am I doing this?
[46:55.22]Okay.
[46:59.52]I'm just thinking about the good times, man.
[47:15.79]I mean, Placidusax.
[47:20.27]Smoking a blunt.
[47:21.01]He didn't even fucking answer my call anymore.
[47:29.46]I'm going to hang out with this motherfucker.
[47:30.90]His weed sucks.
[47:34.63]He's got this low quality dog shit weed.
[47:37.45]It's so awful.
[47:38.33]Placidusics had that fucking good shit.
[47:43.89]Ow!
[47:47.10]Alright.
[47:53.62]You ready?
[47:55.28]Yeah.
[47:56.26]I voted to travel.
[47:57.55]Alright.
[48:04.81]Go to travel.
[48:10.23]I knew he was going to do like L1, L2, L2, and now he's going to be like, oh, I can beat Malenia by myself.
[48:16.34]It's just like Nioh.
[48:19.60]Want to go give it a try?
[48:21.12]No, I don't.
[48:22.98]It's going to be really weak unless it's fully upgraded.
[48:25.20]My whole build is on some like cheesy glintstone pebble ash of a word gimmick.
[48:30.98]Hey, by the way, we're going to have to fight over the next larval tier.
[48:36.61]um I'm gonna do rock paper scissors for it I thought I thought I had one oh you do I don't know are you ready so much stuff in your inventory do you need a larval tea yeah I have one
[48:55.74]Hold it for now, because I feel like there's going to be an opportunity where one of us is going to go, I hate everything that I'm doing right now.
[49:02.68]Spoiler alert, those of you that are watching the VOD right now, it's me.
[49:06.47]So in like an hour or so, I'll be respeccing to something else.
[49:16.45]Nice.
[49:16.55]Nice.
[49:26.26]I actually really like this zone.
[49:33.73]Ooh, that's a lot.
[49:37.07]Your favorite Elden Ring zone.
[49:39.73]Probably this one.
[49:40.99]No, Limgrave.
[49:42.12]It's Limgrave.
[49:46.16]The reason why I like Lyndell so much is because you start to realize that you're so close to getting to the base of the tree.
[49:55.14]Once you can see the opening there, it's almost like, wait a second.
[49:59.37]You can go in it!
[50:03.51]Like, I'm right there.
[50:04.45]The whole time the game has been teasing this gigantic tree.
[50:06.87]And when you're finally there, it's this moment of, holy shit, I'm here right now.
[50:12.16]I'm actually at this place.
[50:14.68]It's been a distant thing for potentially tens of hours.
[50:20.54]And now it's right here.
[50:22.18]Best zone in the game.
[50:24.97]God, FromSoftware does not fucking miss.
[50:28.41]Except for when they made Millennium.
[50:30.25]They missed a big time.
[50:38.96]Where are you?
[50:39.52]I don't know.
[50:42.66]Where are you?
[50:43.28]I had Lobster do tap me.
[50:46.35]Oh, you're dead?
[50:47.49]Yeah.
[50:48.15]Oh, you died.
[50:48.91]How come I didn't even hear you die?
[50:50.01]Because you were talking about how much you love filtering.
[50:56.61]You died.
[50:57.45]Yeah, that was crazy.
[50:58.51]Who even killed me?
[51:02.07]Holy shit.
[51:04.61]That was somehow your fault.
[51:11.46]Where are you now?
[51:12.95]I went back to where you were.
[51:13.91]I was on my way back.
[51:15.17]Because there's like a bonfire right there.
[51:19.59]No, I don't think... Malenia is not that bad.
[51:22.86]She just is.
[51:26.64]She's not that bad.
[51:27.58]She just is.
[51:29.10]Yeah, I'm back into like jumping instead of rolling mode.
[51:32.42]Really?
[51:32.74]Yeah, my brain needs to reset a little bit.
[51:36.95]Yeah, because short-term memory took over yesterday, but long-term memory took over this morning.
[51:40.61]That's interesting how that works.
[51:51.86]This lobster is huge.
[51:55.50]Please kill it.
[51:56.06]It's like one hit.
[51:57.36]It's going to shoot me again.
[51:59.73]Okay.
[52:05.10]Oh, you are unhappy right now?
[52:08.60]It's alright.
[52:09.38]I'm glad Strippen's happy.
[52:11.80]See, that's the problem.
[52:13.14]Strippen is in your head.
[52:15.24]See, when you died from that lobster shot right there, all you could think about was Strippen just, like, spitting food out of his mouth, pointing at the screen and, like, laughing.
[52:23.39]You know what I mean?
[52:24.39]Like, a full open mouth, like, and, like, mashed potatoes and shit, gravy, like, comes out of his mouth and stuff.
[52:29.51]Like, that's what you're seeing.
[52:31.13]You need to get Strippen out of your head.
[52:33.69]I can't.
[52:34.31]He's too handsome.
[52:39.05]Yeah, that's what's happening right now.
[52:41.71]Yeah, he's eating a whole turkey dinner right now.
[52:43.73]He's got stuffing and mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce.
[52:47.03]He's getting piled up this high.
[52:48.27]I am not going to die again the rest of the stream.
[52:54.99]I am activating blood cult initiate.
[52:59.17]Uh-oh.
[53:01.16]Dark gamer god mode.
[53:02.63]Uh-oh.
[53:03.75]I grant you my soul.
[53:07.93]Not you.
[53:08.67]I'm talking to the ancient deep gods.
[53:10.47]That seems like a really bad thing to sell your soul for is to be good at Elden Ring.
[53:17.12]No, it's all game.
[53:22.91]Okay.
[53:24.65]You wouldn't understand.
[53:26.20]So what you're hoping for is you're hoping for, like, you dodge, dodge, dodge, stripping, stripping, and they're like... Okay, you know that scene in Lord of the Rings where, like, the king is like... Like, eating the tomatoes and shit during the battle?
[53:37.20]Like, you're just waiting for that moment.
[53:39.04]Like, it's cutting to stripping.
[53:40.37]Like, you're dodging, dodging, like... Like, eating the chicken and shit.
[53:43.75]Stripping his mouth.
[53:44.29]What the fuck is this fucking tomato-eating noise?
[53:47.11]Have you never seen Lord of the Rings?
[53:49.59]I don't remember this scene.
[53:50.51]Oh.
[53:51.57]How have you not seen Lord of the Rings?
[53:54.08]This scene.
[53:54.50]How do you not remember this?
[53:55.98]The uh the recent uh prime video uh Lord of the Rings show erased all of my memory of Lord of the Rings.
[53:06.00]Oh shit there's a dragon.
[53:13.00]All he knows is Nioh now.
[54:17.69]Yeah, all you have up there is like Nioh information.
[54:21.53]It's true.
[54:23.05]I just, I like go 100% in a thing and then everything else is just removed from the brain.
[54:29.53]How close are you to completing Nioh 2?
[54:33.39]No idea.
[54:33.97]I wonder how close you are.
[54:37.12]Feels like I'm getting close.
[54:39.76]I decided I wanted to play a little today.
[54:43.52]But I decided like if we're going to keep playing Elden Ring, I'm not doing it.
[54:48.53]Cut myself off because it's going to keep... My brain's just going to turn to mush.
[54:56.15]True.
[54:58.71]That's alright.
[55:00.93]You could... I mean... Hey, it's not a bad thing to have something you really like to be able to do whenever you want.
[55:10.36]That's not a bad thing.
[55:15.73]In fact, I feel like a lot of people might be envious of that.
[55:18.28]Because, oh shit, like, oh, I did this, now what?
[55:21.46]I got nothing to do, nothing to play.
[55:22.90]I wish there was some better games.
[55:23.92]You got something that you're ready just to go right back to.
[55:26.15]Yeah.
[55:28.55]I always get annoyed... when streamers are like: It's a fucking game drought right now, there's like no games, there's nothing.
[55:30.45]Are you one of those? Are you one of those? They're like there's no games right now.
[55:38.45]Because I don't- you don't seem like you'd be one because you're willing to go back and play fucking Driver in the PS1.
[55:43.00]Ster, my most played game on stream is House Flipper. I- yeah I think you- yeah, yeah this is not the right person to ask this.
[55:50.00]Okay.
[55:52.00]Um but yeah no I know what you mean.
[55:54.00]Like there's- there's like 20 years- 30 years- a Malenia of video games. Just pick one.
[56:04.58]That didn't work.
[56:15.33]Wait, there's a Malenia of video games?
[56:18.81]Yep.
[56:20.89]I stole that from chat.
[56:24.45]It sounds like a chat comment now you say it.
[56:31.43]Anybody that says there's no games, I don't want to hear it if you haven't played Gex.
[56:38.29]You haven't beat Chrono Trigger yet.
[56:39.93]It's true.
[56:42.01]I've never been done.
[56:46.77]I like how you're actually experiencing the game still.
[56:50.94]I got so lost in this area for a really long time.
[56:56.46]It is very, very easy to get lost here.
[57:00.40]think I have been down there I'm just forgetting there's a I'm trying to I this is okay this is my favorite area I still have no idea where the hell I'm going oh there's an I think there's an elevator in here that takes us down yeah you go down to the kind of courtyard level and then there's a few ways to go
[57:15.79]I know that when you get to the top, you jump off the roof and you land on the other roof and then you skip the area.
[57:21.13]Seedbed curse is that item right there in a regular playthrough.
[57:24.13]Saved you a little bit of time.
[57:26.40]This guy kind of knows where he's at.
[57:27.92]This guy is like aware of this.
[57:35.18]That thing's going to be really annoying.
[57:36.18]Where even is it?
[57:37.32]Oh, I don't know.
[57:40.55]This is.
[57:43.51]What is that?
[57:45.61]that is what what is this a dragon wait I'm poisoned what is what the even is in the building here that's a dragon or a gargoyle I've angered it wait did you jump what side did you jump down I didn't jump down I'm still up here I was hitting the wing inside this room oh come down here this guy's actually hard and sucks well I kind of said I wasn't gonna die again
[58:16.81]Alright, I'll take care of it.
[58:34.09]Ooh.
[58:40.29]Yeah, that guy's usually here.
[58:41.21]I wonder if maybe just forever here.
[58:47.71]He's that good of a guardsman.
[58:55.94]Oh, God.
[59:00.14]Is that coming through the wall?
[59:02.34]Holy shit!
[59:06.89]He just turned this whole area into a Virtual Boy game.
[59:10.93]I've said that before.
[59:11.83]Pretty recently.
[59:14.68]No repeat jokes.
[59:15.52]This is a rehearsal.
[59:16.54]Hey, sometimes the good ones get to stay.
[59:18.36]Can you imagine in the like... Where was the fire?
[59:25.06]Oh.
[59:27.42]That's where he is.
[59:28.52]Oh my god.
[59:30.46]It's got a lot of health.
[59:34.81]Yeah.
[59:35.63]Can it actually hurt us though?
[59:36.97]Ow!
[59:37.11]Ow!
[59:39.36]as my head gets pancaked.
[59:43.97]Wait, it's up in the air.
[59:47.61]I think we're safe from the fire, though.
[59:50.65]I guess not.
[59:51.61]Can you stop saying shit like that?
[59:57.11]It's like a Marvel movie.
[59:59.20]Ah, man, it's alright.
[60:00.48]Fire can't get us in here.
[60:01.68]Whoa!
[60:04.86]Ah, it burnt me!
[60:05.96]What the heck, Star-Lord?
[60:09.24]Burp me.
[60:10.23]It burnt me.
[60:11.83]Burp burp me Star Lord.
[60:13.97]I like that version.
[60:22.43]Legendary in here.
[60:23.41]They're going to minus to that one.
[60:28.44]Get out of here.
[60:33.40]Oh man, that's unfortunate.
[60:34.24]That joke went really well in rehearsal.
[60:38.48]That's like 30, 40k, right?
[60:39.48]Oh, yeah.
[60:42.88]I don't have power.
[60:48.10]I'm trying to do something.
[60:48.98]Get the fuck away from me.
[60:54.47]Do dragons have blood?
[60:57.49]Apparently.
[60:58.25]Can I make him bleed?
[61:00.03]I wonder.
[61:03.47]You should be able to.
[61:04.19]At least the fire can't get us in here.
[61:20.94]Ooh.
[61:27.31]I don't even know what you're swinging at, but... Oh, you can't... You couldn't see it?
[61:31.73]No.
[61:33.57]do we uh we both stack bleed together if we're both bleeding right I believe that's accurate yes I mean I don't see why not uh I think the dragon is on I think the dragon is on the roof no where'd he go there's a lot of guys in this room and they're all aggroed to the dragon they are why are they fighting the dragon
[62:08.22]oh shit I don't know it's a fucking jellyfish ah it's a spell he's casting bubbles oh my god dragons dragons almost dead
[62:39.71]How do we get?
[62:40.07]I don't know where you went.
[62:49.99]We're supposed to go like down to the courtyard down there.
[62:52.39]Yeah, I'm trying to.
[62:54.02]I just want to kill a dragon.
[62:55.12]Yeah, that's smart.
[62:57.54]Wicked smart.
[63:00.40]Put your head up here, please.
[63:01.50]There it is.
[63:04.92]Why?
[63:05.24]Do I need mana?
[63:08.80]What?
[63:10.73]I didn't think this took mana.
[63:15.90]It's a webinar that I'm pretty sure they all do.
[63:24.04]You're hitting it right now.
[63:25.22]Yeah, I guess so.
[63:25.98]I just see a health bar in the sky that's like taking.
[63:31.65]OK, great job.
[63:38.51]We get an item.
[63:42.25]Do you think that when dragons die, they turn to dust like that because of how much weed they've been smoking with you?
[63:49.46]Like all the vapors just come out?
[63:55.34]Eh, it was alright.
[63:57.30]It was alright.
[64:00.40]Oh, he's doing the jump strat.
[64:06.14]And then from here you go down.
[64:07.96]I don't think this is... Okay, but we... Yeah.
[64:16.70]Hold on.
[64:17.44]I got a few things here.
[64:18.56]Let me see what these are.
[64:21.53]Yep.
[64:22.61]As my first carrion, I've upgraded carrion staff all game.
[64:25.82]My first carrion spell.
[64:31.12]I think I have some carry and shit that you would want.
[64:34.31]But you don't.
[64:35.01]I mean, we're changing our builds so frequently.
[64:37.91]I'm not.
[64:39.47]I've been using the same.
[64:41.39]I switched once and then I switched back because I realized that was wrong.
[64:44.91]That is more than I have.
[64:52.29]Okay, mister.
[64:52.95]I have upgraded like seven weapons this run.
[64:55.81]I have put plus one to +2 in three or four weapons.
[65:02.07]I only have two items that are over plus five.
[65:05.55]And one of them is the finger.
[65:06.39]It doesn't count because you stole it from me.
[65:10.15]Okay, it's one of these things.
[65:12.47]Get ready.
[65:13.17]Oh, I don't have the heals anymore.
[65:14.51]Which is like half the reason I did it.
[65:16.75]No, no, no.
[65:17.03]This thing isn't effective.
[65:17.85]Oh, no, no.
[65:18.15]Okay, this isn't... Okay, this guy's not bad.
[65:20.39]It's one of those... Are they sentries or what are they called?
[65:25.65]I'll tell you.
[65:27.03]The weapon that you get from these things is actually really fun.
[65:31.26]Yeah, I agree.
[65:32.18]The dual welding light weapons.
[65:34.48]I don't know what's happening.
[65:37.75]My screen like froze.
[65:46.87]Crucible.
[65:47.77]Oh, I can look cool now.
[65:50.15]I also got a Crucible Tree armor.
[65:58.49]I got the armor.
[65:59.09]You got the helmet.
[66:00.02]I'm so much hotter than you.
[66:02.38]No.
[66:08.56]You look like you're about to play Warframe.
[66:09.92]You do.
[66:13.56]Okay.
[66:18.35]Look.
[66:22.83]Look.
[66:31.83]Is she talking to you?
[66:32.96]No, she did earlier.
[66:34.56]I told her I am already married and I can't be seen with you.
[66:45.28]The Lord's runes, do I need to use that for anything else?
[66:50.61]Or is it just purely an enormous amount of runes?
[66:57.13]Wow, that's a lot.
[67:10.22]Can we break 100k?
[67:10.68]Come on, can we break 100k?
[67:21.23]Never mind, it wasn't the magic.
[67:22.61]It was an ash of war.
[67:26.49]Guys, we didn't break 100k.
[67:46.20]Now, out here, there's... On one side, there's usually a... To our left, there's a big scary man.
[67:56.79]Okay, for one second, I was like, what did the mod do, and why is this dragon so big?
[68:05.22]Owl?
[68:07.41]What is happening?
[68:10.27]Like a meteor landed on my head.
[68:13.39]Meteor?
[68:14.53]Yeah.
[68:16.79]I have no idea what that was.
[68:21.07]There's usually a ulcerated tree spirit over here somewhere, right?
[68:24.76]It wasn't this thing, was it?
[68:28.66]That was a lot of damage.
[68:36.49]yeah there's like some big creature under the ground that's occasionally hitting me inside this building okay well let's go find it yeah it's shaking the whole game it's a bear behind us oh there is a bear oh fuck that's a big one
[69:03.61]okay he wasn't actually stuck he was just like pretending uh oh where's the bleed how many times I gotta hit you Jesus
[69:44.05]Once would be nice.
[69:45.63]Huh?
[69:45.79]You talking to me?
[69:51.49]Yeah.
[69:52.43]Once what?
[69:53.98]Hitting him once.
[69:58.76]Oh he can't come down this hallway.
[70:04.88]What is the bleed resistance on this bear?
[70:06.68]Holy shit.
[70:08.34]I just held this on his like butt for a solid five straight seconds.
[70:20.97]I, that was, he dropped beast blood.
[70:23.11]I don't like that.
[70:25.31]Alright, so we can either go up, and going up brings us to Godfrey's room?
[70:32.51]Right?
[70:34.06]I prefer Godfrey.
[70:35.02]I already have one of these.
[70:38.86]Or we can go down into the well and go down to the shunning grounds or whatever it is.
[70:45.76]Oh, the sewers?
[70:47.01]Down to the tree fingers?
[70:49.29]The tree?
[70:49.71]There's also, looks like kind of sneaking around down there is... Glintstone Dragon?
[70:56.21]Glintstone Dragon.
[70:57.17]Yeah, he's like totally blocking the whole sewer.
[71:00.11]I feel like that's probably not a good way to go right now.
[71:08.31]D-Dual Omen.
[71:10.19]Dual Weld, Dual Omen, Dual Omen.
[71:12.11]Please.
[71:12.43]That's not a bad idea.
[71:18.20]NOOOO!
[71:19.00]The mashed potatoes just shot out of his mouth.
[71:24.40]The mashed potatoes just launched out of Strippen's mouth.
[71:29.09]God damn it, dude.
[71:31.75]Dude, that was like a fucking Looney Tunes episode.
[71:35.37]Uhhh.
[71:38.31]Dude, I would be careful, man.
[71:40.57]You stripping right now may have just eaten like a chicken wing.
[71:43.53]And it's like, you may have choked him because that was so funny.
[71:49.07]And he only said, I don't think he's watching.
[71:51.12]I don't think he's going to watch the VOD.
[71:52.78]I just, I'm not going to bring any of this up.
[71:58.92]You were just, you were like, one, two, three, just right over the edge.
[72:04.50]It was so perfect.
[72:06.28]I was like totally spaced out in my head.
[72:08.22]It was so fucking funny.
[72:14.29]Oh, man.
[72:14.95]I only barely.
[72:16.85]That was so perfect.
[72:19.05]A little fresh restart.
[72:20.63]Reset my pact.
[72:21.79]That has to be the ultimate fall joke.
[72:28.73]Your reaction was immediate.
[72:37.62]Somber seven.
[72:38.36]I'm not going to say that out loud.
[72:39.22]I don't want him to know I have one of these.
[72:40.38]It's mine.
[72:43.40]I need a nine.
[72:44.20]I need a somber nine and a ancient one.
[72:48.78]I'll take another Lord's Rune.
[72:51.11]An easy 50k.
[72:52.13]Oh, another legendary?
[72:54.93]Hero's Rune.
[72:57.06]That's the last thing he heard before he died by the way he's been practicing the trombone was me in his ear That's so fucked up
[73:27.36]It's a horrible way to go.
[73:34.50]I got a Remembrance of the Regal Ancestor.
[73:39.38]I'm going to hold on to it.
[73:41.15]I got a Hero's Urn.
[73:46.49]Level up.
[73:47.81]That's not enough.
[73:48.73]I wonder if these souls later.
[73:51.23]Do you need some?
[73:53.57]I'm like 15k more I think I am willing to do something for you because I know that it's been a little rough oh god and then like a week later he comes back with like remember that time that I gave you a lord's remember hey remember on stream that time I gave you the lord's rune and then he asked me to do something wicked yeah freaked up yeah but I mean I know I'm a little bit higher than you I feel like you you should have that level up a couple times
[74:22.30]Okay.
[74:22.72]Just trying to do a good thing.
[74:24.02]Just worried about what this is going to cost me.
[74:26.18]Just don't forget.
[74:27.68]Don't forget what I did, right?
[74:29.37]Yeah, I know you won't.
[74:30.65]I'll make sure you don't.
[74:33.37]I mean, I think I left my souls from that jump.
[74:36.71]I don't even, I don't want to think about it.
[74:42.40]What level are you after this?
[74:47.78]Like 15.
[74:49.70]That'd be so bad.
[74:52.83]Don't you start at, like, level 15?
[74:54.13]You're not supposed to be 15 at this point in the game?
[74:57.07]I need, like, 200 souls.
[75:00.80]Just kill, like, one enemy.
[75:01.94]You can go back and kill Carl again.
[75:08.52]Okay.
[75:19.70]Nice.
[75:21.04]I got another sacred tear.
[75:23.05]That was also a hero's rune.
[75:26.17]Was it really?
[75:26.63]Yeah.
[75:27.83]Well, maybe you can level up more than once.
[75:29.21]Foster tech.
[75:34.69]Thank you.
[75:35.17]Actually.
[75:35.51]Did I go the wrong way?
[75:36.94]I did.
[75:39.58]You got to go up.
[75:45.82]Upstairs.
[76:06.37]I opened... something.
[76:07.63]I don't know.
[76:08.93]There was a lever.
[76:10.69]I've never played this game before, I don't know what that does.
[76:24.08]Okay, let's go.
[76:25.86]We can walk straight up to Godfrey?
[76:27.80]Or to, uh... What's his name?
[76:30.84]G-Goodfrey?
[76:32.14]Gerdfrey?
[76:32.70]What'd you say?
[76:33.56]Gertrude?
[76:34.18]Up on the top of the tree?
[76:34.96]Godfrey.
[76:36.73]well there's him and then there's the magical mystical man yes Gertrude
[77:07.05]Careful here.
[77:11.59]Will they beat Gertrude first try?
[77:13.37]Well, it depends who it is.
[77:14.29]It might not be Gertrude.
[77:15.51]It might be like... It might be like fucking Placidusax again.
[77:21.39]I hope it's not something bad because this room is very, very small, isn't it?
[77:25.19]And we could get absolutely screwed here.
[77:29.31]Legendary over there.
[77:30.05]I have to get that.
[77:32.88]Could be a Lord's room.
[77:38.34]where where that guy's hanging over there watch out we got a plant on the tree yeah we do okay that's a lot of health bleed I don't think plants have blood yes they do it's called chlorophyll let's just go
[78:23.76]Please.
[78:25.04]I would do not dodge here.
[78:26.04]I would just hold your weapon up.
[78:34.23]Nice.
[78:42.54]That's dangerous to do up here.
[78:43.78]That's a lot of confidence.
[78:44.80]Can you imagine staring this down and going, yeah, I think I'll do 10 cartwheels in a row down this.
[78:55.37]That's not a good idea.
[78:56.97]Hold on.
[79:01.47]I want to get this item.
[79:03.08]Yeah, I want to get it too because my items can be better than your item.
[79:06.28]I bet you $100 mine is better than yours.
[79:08.20]Alright, fine.
[79:10.48]Whatever item this is, like rarity or quality?
[79:13.16]Just quality.
[79:14.72]Like whatever it is.
[79:16.60]Like an opinion.
[79:17.30]Mine's way better.
[79:18.08]Mine?
[79:18.40]No, it's not.
[79:19.90]I just got Flame of the Fel God.
[79:23.54]Legendary spell.
[79:26.20]I got the Remembrance of fucking Godwyn.
[79:33.23]I kind of want to just do like 90 faith and just do all these wacky ass spells.
[79:45.84]I think that still fits with Mii Strong's character arc if he just throws like raging fireballs.
[79:50.33]You know what I mean?
[79:50.83]He's just like angry.
[79:52.61]Mii rage.
[79:53.91]There's another dragon in here.
[79:55.59]Oh no!
[79:57.19]What dragon is it?
[80:01.07]Red.
[80:03.62]Red.
[80:05.04]It's a red dragon, man.
[80:08.18]It's the lich dragon?
[80:11.34]What the fuck?
[80:13.04]I don't know what that is.
[80:14.19]Neither do I. I feel like I said it with a lot of nervousness.
[80:18.67]Oh, it's Fortisax.
[80:20.41]First Elden Lord.
[80:28.00]Oh, he has the... I've never had... I've never done this fight.
[80:41.44]Because I've never played this game before.
[80:42.72]This is my first time playing Elden Ring.
[80:44.28]Why would they put a dragon in this room?
[80:45.50]Miyazaki, you're fucking wild.
[80:46.95]I don't know.
[80:47.95]It's really... It's actually not that big of a deal.
[80:51.59]It's like okay as long as it doesn't do anything else.
[80:59.99]There's just kind of shit everywhere though.
[81:09.82]Oh, God.
[81:10.86]Oh, God!
[81:11.58]It's really... It's just kind of a mess, but as long as we... It's not killing us too hard.
[81:29.43]That's a lot of damage.
[81:35.99]Um... He's in the top row.
[81:40.07]off the top rope the hurricanrana he's he's gonna like oh the music is playing I'm gonna get down there no my big entrance they're gonna think I'm such a dork get down here this dragon sucks at this game
[82:14.84]We gotta like get in there and get some hits in.
[82:36.24]Okay, he's in the dome.
[82:44.67]He just hit his neck on the top.
[82:49.80]He just went like... That probably hurts so bad.
[82:53.68]He is doing a good job hiding how bad that hurt.
[82:57.96]I'll just keep fighting like it's normal.
[82:59.56]That's like a, oh, dude, are you alright, man?
[83:02.20]Yeah, I'm fine.
[83:03.68]Yeah, I'm okay.
[83:04.24]I'm alright.
[83:04.56]I don't know.
[83:05.40]That looks really bad.
[83:06.40]No, I'm good.
[83:06.95]I'm good.
[83:07.23]I'm good.
[83:08.09]It's like, do you want to go to like a doctor or something?
[83:14.11]It's so hard.
[83:27.24]See, right now, he's having the reverse problem that we have.
[83:31.86]He is complaining on his stream right now.
[83:34.42]This is so fucking stupid.
[83:35.54]How am I supposed to fight these guys?
[83:36.86]These little ants in this room.
[83:38.58]I can't even fit in here.
[83:39.62]This randomizer is so bad.
[83:43.36]How are you expected to actually do this?
[83:47.28]Look, I can't even fit up here.
[83:48.50]Fucking game is so stupid.
[83:56.50]That actually hurt a lot.
[84:01.51]I missed.
[84:09.69]I'm concerned for my life, but I think you got him.
[84:13.02]Kind of got me in the corner.
[84:14.50]He's dead in 321.
[84:20.51]Got it.
[84:24.09]Sacred here.
[84:24.91]Finally, I've been needing one.
[84:28.47]Oh.
[84:28.63]What is sex?
[84:31.03]Just went offline as his offline screens up.
[84:34.73]Oh.
[84:37.30]He'll be back.
[84:38.00]Can somebody go into his chat and just be like... I don't know.
[84:42.34]We were just, like, fucking around.
[84:45.68]I kind of feel bad, though.
[84:47.54]Because he's probably pissed.
[84:49.18]Hold on.
[84:49.50]I'll see if he's... I'm in his Discord.
[84:51.24]I'm going to say, like, get owned in his Discord.
[84:53.60]Don't.
[84:54.48]Don't be an idiot.
[85:04.00]Hold on.
[85:04.26]I got 100,000 souls.
[85:04.54]Hold on.
[85:08.82]wait you level in this game I totally was just walking away I feel like I'm just going endurance whatever you know in like the hour that we've not been fighting Malenia I have actually leveled like six or seven times you wait you have not no I've leveled like eight times
[85:30.91]All we had to do was, like, not fight Malenia for, like, a little bit.
[85:34.29]I know.
[85:35.57]I'm so glad that after that first attempt that I just started, you could just tell I was already annoyed.
[85:40.28]I think it was already going poorly, and I'm so glad we just pulled the plug.
[85:47.33]Get in the bowl.
[85:56.54]Now, that Fortisax is gonna open my stream, and he's gonna think we're, like, BMing him by, like, jumping around and shit.
[86:02.01]Okay, just play, like... Just play normally.
[86:04.03]Don't, like, if he's watching, I don't want to be, like, I don't know.
[86:06.77]He's fucking huge, man.
[86:08.15]I mean, if someone, like, I don't even, this scenario, this joke is weird, but if someone beat you so bad that you turned off your stream, would you sit there, seizing in anger, open up their stream?
[86:19.42]Like, like, ah, fuck this, I'm done.
[86:21.58]And then, then, like...
[86:23.90]watch their stream you know what probably what you okay look if you were like fighting and then you knew it was like two other streamers and they were like oh yeah Fortisax we fucking got your ass you know what I mean you don't think you'd wait you'd watch me like what the fuck are they saying now what are they saying now defeat it that you turn off your own stream I feel like you need to get out of the room like you've already lost yeah you've already lost
[86:56.81]uh do you want more memory slots do I yes do you want like more spell slots I know you keep saying I don't use spells I'm I'm good I don't know what happened on my memory slots I think when I respect I lost a lot of them because I had like two full rows I kept getting them but now I've got like five slots
[87:22.84]Oh, dude.
[87:23.32]Fortisax raid.
[87:24.54]What's up, Fortisax?
[87:28.44]Thanks for the raid.
[87:28.94]I mean, I know what you were just doing.
[87:31.14]Appreciate the raid, though.
[87:36.17]Okay, let's go.
[87:37.25]Boss.
[87:41.51]Ignore Fortisax.
[87:44.87]Alright, so what's in here besides... Oh, God.
[87:52.44]I see.
[87:53.66]You know what's in there?
[87:55.52]I know what's in there, and you're going to want to equip your Rykard bike.
[88:00.45]My Rykard bike?
[88:02.79]The pike, the spear that he gives you.
[88:05.31]Oh, does that mean that Rykard is in here?
[88:11.81]Yeah.
[88:12.67]Okay.
[88:13.23]I think it only worked for one of us, so you go in first.
[88:21.72]It appears to be his stage two.
[88:23.06]It's stage two.
[88:24.14]Wait a minute.
[88:30.72]Graceless, tarnished.
[88:33.30]Oh, it's the regular cutscene.
[88:35.52]Lame.
[88:37.46]I just want to hear him say together.
[88:40.11]This is a small arena for him.
[88:42.07]Yep.
[88:48.71]It is.
[88:53.01]Very easy.
[88:56.15]I don't think I can help.
[89:03.25]If we do this again, I'm going to have to do more mana flasks.
[89:08.22]What is happening?
[89:08.82]I don't know.
[89:12.86]He's swinging at me.
[89:14.96]Shit.
[89:18.64]Wait, what?
[89:19.64]Oh, it's Morgott talking.
[89:23.24]Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
[89:25.60]It's like Morgott went to phase two.
[89:32.96]What's that?
[89:33.24]Is there a car driving?
[89:34.28]Yes.
[89:36.78]What is that?
[89:37.52]Was there a car?
[89:38.20]There's a motorbike on the highway.
[89:41.16]Wait, no.
[89:41.50]Is that from your room?
[89:44.31]No.
[89:45.49]What the hell was that?
[89:46.71]That was in the game?
[89:47.59]No, it was not.
[89:48.69]Yes, it was.
[89:52.25]I'm gonna die.
[90:08.49]No fuck.
[90:10.47]Oh wait, he does this thing.
[90:11.43]Alright, he's dead in 321.
[90:18.52]Ice.
[90:26.86]Yeah.
[90:28.46]Two Sacred Tears and Godrick's Great Rune.
[90:33.09]Oh, really?
[90:34.97]Oh, really?
[90:35.71]That's pretty sick.
[90:36.97]That is sick.
[90:41.11]When I was walking up to this for the first time and just looking at this shit, and I was like, oh my God, I'm going in the room.
[90:46.55]It was like, I was like, oh my God.
[91:06.63]What?
[91:08.20]What?
[91:08.42]You can't get in the Erdtree.
[91:10.18]Oh my god.
[91:11.14]It would have been funny if this was DLC.
[91:14.38]They just didn't do anything with it.
[91:15.96]That would not be funny.
[91:18.91]That would be actually really infuriating.
[91:26.79]And it's paid DLC.
[91:32.52]Hello.
[91:33.88]Old friend.
[91:38.97]I got the animation like she appeared, but she's not here for me.
[91:42.01]I'll just stand up and you can do it.
[91:44.71]Um... Are we supposed to get something important here?
[91:56.04]She gave me a cookbook.
[91:58.64]I think...
[92:01.77]huh isn't this where she tells you that like she wants to smoke up it's the the medallion oh the medallion what do we do what medallion the rolled medallion to get up I have a full one you have it yeah
[92:30.23]Yeah, I got that like really early on on the first day I completed the whole medallion.
[92:33.80]Thank goodness.
[92:37.22]She gave me memory.
[92:38.42]Everyone's giving me golden seeds.
[92:40.36]She's like here.
[92:40.84]I don't know all of it.
[92:42.16]We all have plenty of these.
[92:53.71]Can we go to Godrick's Tower so I can get the great rune?
[92:58.23]Yes.
[93:03.35]I believe it is.
[93:04.63]It must be this one.
[93:05.43]It's the one in the castle is Godrick, right?
[93:10.71]Why can't I travel?
[93:14.67]Can I travel to a site of Grace right now?
[93:16.59]Why not?
[93:16.89]If I can... I don't know.
[93:25.04]Why can't I?
[93:25.80]If it's multiple pieces, you have the wrong medallion.
[93:37.58]Was it multiple pieces?
[93:38.55]I'm not sure.
[93:42.35]Hold on.
[93:42.71]Look at what I have.
[93:46.67]Buried deep within my inventory.
[93:48.83]Rolled Medallion operates the Grand Lift of Rolled.
[93:59.56]There you go.
[94:01.91]I think I might have just thought it was two pieces because it is split in half like the image of it I just destroyed I didn't mean to do that let's just sit on it I think I just assumed it was pieces so I um you got to talk to the corpse I did but I can't go anywhere
[94:30.74]I have to check the thorns, though.
[94:35.68]Oh, did you not, like, talk to the thorns?
[94:38.64]Maybe that's what it is.
[94:40.68]Technically, I guess, no.
[94:43.73]Those thorns are lonely.
[94:45.35]It's a known bug.
[94:46.03]You have to separate.
[94:47.07]You have to separate.
[94:48.75]I love you.
[94:51.03]Banish me.
[94:52.25]Banish me now.
[94:54.95]And, hey, before you go, drop that larval tear on the ground, if you would.
[95:20.72]Okay.
[95:26.45]You can come back to my world and get it if you fucking grovel a little bit.
[95:31.09]The game crashed.
[95:32.11]I think it was my thing.
[95:33.33]My game was probably waiting to crash.
[95:35.03]So it was just like, Hold on.
[95:38.31]Hold on momentarily.
[95:40.05]I'm just gonna walk up to the tower.
[95:41.76]I don't know if you'd like you get items here too.
[95:44.60]Or if you can even come.
[95:49.27]OK, he's going to go.
[95:50.77]He's going to go pee.
[95:51.92]OK.
[95:53.12]You're definitely going to want to mute them because I'm going to go off on a tangent.
[97:12.05]I'm back.
[97:13.01]To the areas where he walks away to, you know, just be as weird as possible.
[97:16.31]How you doing?
[97:17.43]I'm good.
[97:17.69]I made sure to be very quick.
[97:20.93]Wow, you can do that.
[97:21.97]You sacrificed your bathroom time for me.
[97:25.62]Well, I don't know.
[97:27.74]We didn't stand up for eight hours yesterday.
[97:30.34]And I kind of want to make sure every couple hours I get up.
[97:37.43]That's valid.
[97:41.17]And based.
[97:42.65]Yeah.
[97:47.19]Alright.
[97:48.49]Somebody says I'm crazy.
[97:49.87]Alright.
[97:51.63]So let me open my game again.
[97:53.27]Okay.
[97:56.85]Alright.
[98:00.36]Okay.
[98:04.79]What's better, Bloodborne or Elden Ring?
[98:07.95]Elden Ring is probably the best single player experience I've probably had in a long time.
[98:14.27]It's hard to compare them because they're almost 10 years apart.
[98:17.04]It's difficult.
[98:21.38]to say any it's hard to do that uh I think Elden Ring is I think elder rings probably better but it's just newer and there's more in it it's hard to say it's my Dark Souls 2 argument there's just more it'd be nice if there was more Bloodborne okay I hold on let me bring this back
[98:50.55]You should be able to see.
[98:52.37]Yes, you can.
[98:53.45]OK.
[98:54.93]Can you see?
[98:57.59]Alright, I'm going to you have your thing on.
[99:01.81]Yeah, do I?
[99:06.41]Maybe the 30 FPS cap, yeah, it's.
[99:11.27]That's probably the only thing holding that back at this point.
[99:16.83]I have a feeling.
[99:19.15]Deep in my soul.
[99:21.43]Even for reasons I've told you but can't say.
[99:23.37]That they're waiting for something for Bloodborne.
[99:28.65]Like some Demon's Souls remaster treatment or something.
[99:32.85]If they did the Demon's Souls remake, you have to assume that Bloodborne will get... Maybe, I don't know.
[99:38.95]I feel like, is it one of those scenarios where they coded it to a point where it's like, well, we kind of can't do anything about this.
[99:46.17]It's just, this is the game.
[99:48.96]I doubt it.
[99:49.64]When Demon's Souls got, like how good that remaster is and how old Demon's Souls is.
[99:54.02]But Demon's, the Demon's Souls remaster was like a complete 100% remake of the entire game.
[99:59.56]It wasn't like a, oh, HD texture pack.
[100:02.42]I never got to play it because I don't have a PS5.
[100:04.04]Me either.
[100:05.95]But that was a, it was a complete, they made the whole game over again.
[100:10.93]So it's not like a Dark Souls remastered kind of scenario.
[100:19.18]I sure, you know what?
[100:21.12]When I'm 80 years old and all of the lawsuits have caught up with me and I'm on my deathbed, I really hope there's more Bloodborne content.
[100:30.83]You're just riddled in lawsuits and you're 80.
[100:33.53]Yeah.
[100:33.87]Isn't there somebody on this bridge usually?
[100:43.02]Two giants.
[100:46.86]And at the end of this bridge, no, it's just a really, really long bridge.
[101:06.61]I will go down and say the old hunters is the best DLC in any FromSoftware game.
[101:15.98]OK, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[101:19.98]Yeah, yeah, sure.
[101:20.98]Yeah, right, OK.
[101:27.34]Isn't there some weird stuff with one of these?
[101:30.76]You go, there's a boss like in this.
[101:32.26]You go all the way down or something.
[101:33.79]Yeah, you like you.
[101:35.01]You travel across one of the bridges and your whole screen turns black and you fight like two of the omen people.
[101:40.75]That is what happens, right?
[101:42.59]OK.
[101:50.93]ring city was pretty good yeah but I think as a whole okay wait what's the the Bloodborne boss's name in the clock tower uh you know you know the one Maria yeah Maria is if like Malenia wasn't dog it's like they wanted to do Maria again because people really liked her
[102:18.47]And then they put her in a game where you can't actually dodge that quickly.
[102:33.76]Okay, real question.
[102:35.46]Real question before I restore the power of the Great Run.
[102:37.38]Yes.
[102:38.28]You're in the Elden Ring universe and you come up here and the Two Fingers here and it's this holy... Dude, look how holy this shit is.
[102:43.95]You think you would take a bite?
[102:46.82]No, because that would be disrespecting this holy thing.
[102:49.78]And that would be a complete disrespect.
[102:51.18]And it would be, what do you think you're doing?
[102:54.50]You see, you see like the ripped up?
[102:56.29]It's kind of like, it's kind of like bark, like tree.
[103:00.27]Get it?
[103:00.67]Tree fingers.
[103:04.09]Hold on.
[103:04.47]Honestly, like, I think you just kind of said something really profound.
[103:08.19]Hold on.
[103:10.79]It is like tree.
[103:11.91]It is like a tree bark.
[103:14.25]Yeah, tree fingers.
[103:22.27]It's a tree.
[103:29.58]Get Fatty on the phone immediately!
[103:31.10]Okay, where are we going?
[103:42.81]Um... We can go.
[103:49.43]So we... You have the medallion.
[103:54.36]Here are your options.
[103:54.90]The medallion of rolled, yeah.
[103:56.42]We can do the weird upside down area.
[104:00.67]Okay, but you know, you I have that item, we can put the Yes, I'm thinking it goes upside down and do that.
[104:08.03]Yes.
[104:08.85]Yes.
[104:10.06]We could, uh, we could go and I want to hear option two, we could go in and you know, I mean, we could do that.
[104:17.18]But I mean, that's a possibility.
[104:20.54]We could go do the medallion.
[104:26.28]Or we can go to the upside down.
[104:28.36]Medallion, upside down world, or ****.
[104:31.92]And we're not doing that one because we're just not.
[104:36.96]Okay, upside down.
[104:38.46]My vote has been in.
[104:39.74]You're voting for upside down world?
[104:41.58]Yeah.
[104:44.12]Okay, so then we have to go to lake facing cliffs and go from there, right?
[104:51.74]I think.
[104:51.98]That's a pretty far ride.
[104:54.38]That's a pretty far ride.
[104:57.21]Oh, we could go down into the shunning grounds.
[104:59.93]The sewers.
[105:01.81]That's where Mohg is.
[105:09.35]That's great for Mohg.
[105:11.11]Isn't there a place further up where we can... It's a fake Mohg, but yeah.
[105:16.94]What's your question?
[105:17.46]I don't know if we have to go this far back.
[105:23.00]I don't know.
[105:25.00]I'm going to follow you.
[105:25.70]Dude,
[105:27.88]Take the wheels.
[105:30.12]Somebody's name is Gaming Dragon Fortisax.
[105:33.65]I think they're trying to tap into that market there.
[105:42.99]Alright, so we need to find a way to go like here.
[105:45.01]I don't know about you, but I have a lot of Fortisax.
[105:52.72]Trying to figure out what you are saying right now.
[105:58.22]We need to go down that way.
[106:04.21]What does he mean?
[106:04.93]What do you mean?
[106:05.69]No, don't even explain it.
[106:08.90]gonna be honest I don't really know I think it's open to interpretation did I go the wrong like we're not supposed to go this way I'm trying to find like we need to go down there how do you get down there oh yeah yeah on the edge of the cliff that way there's a whole bunch of those uh things on the wall that you can jump down is there yeah there's some cliff side of wall jumps is there yes
[106:34.82]God, listen, listen.
[106:37.68]They won't.
[106:38.46]They won't leave me alone.
[106:43.22]So am I going the wrong way or are you going the wrong way?
[106:46.32]I don't even know where you're going.
[106:50.00]I'm trying to go down here like to get to where I mean, like, would we go this far apart?
[106:55.62]We think so much.
[106:56.50]I don't know where you actually are.
[106:57.96]Alright.
[106:58.80]We need to just get back together again.
[107:00.64]Hold on.
[107:03.20]You've gone too far.
[107:04.88]I'm coming, I'm coming.
[107:06.60]I thought there was a different way to get down here.
[107:08.99]Coming back.
[107:10.11]You've gone too far.
[107:10.93]It's these, like... Sideways tombstones.
[107:18.60]Right here.
[107:28.08]Oh!
[107:31.24]I wanted you to think I was jumping off.
[107:34.08]Well, that's what you got to do.
[107:37.19]I freaked out.
[107:41.99]Nice joke.
[107:43.37]I freaked.
[107:43.93]I didn't.
[107:44.31]I knew I wasn't going to make the second jump.
[107:46.00]And I was like, fuck, I have to double jump.
[107:48.26]But I don't want to double jump too far because I'll go over the tombstone.
[107:51.16]I've done enough of those jokes today.
[107:52.74]No.
[108:03.46]Well, we can work.
[108:04.14]There's there's a bonfire here.
[108:06.18]If you can't handle those jumps, I can.
[108:08.84]I don't know.
[108:14.69]I don't know.
[108:15.05]I don't know if you can handle these jumps.
[108:17.67]Well, I just did.
[108:19.99]Something to say.
[108:28.72]Okay, so there's actually a lot of random shit we could do here.
[108:31.30]We could do this.
[108:33.32]I think there's probably a jail here too, isn't there?
[108:34.94]Yes.
[108:36.26]Do you know what's crazy about our playthrough?
[108:38.32]This game is so giant.
[108:39.28]We keep talking about how giant and big this game is.
[108:42.33]And then it was also like, no, the only thing we can do is Malenia.
[108:47.43]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[108:50.37]We didn't have the key to the manor.
[108:52.07]We didn't have the two great ruins.
[108:53.61]We could go this whole side path.
[108:56.80]We didn't do any of this.
[108:57.87]Yeah, but game progress.
[108:59.85]We were just beating our head against the wall trying to do game progress.
[109:04.03]I don't know.
[109:04.37]We made a lot of progress and we haven't killed her yet.
[109:05.91]Doing game progress.
[109:08.35]Because we got the two items we needed to keep game progress going.
[109:13.44]I don't know why you were convinced that Malenia had those two items.
[109:21.06]That's true.
[109:23.64]Censor him.
[109:31.67]Dung Eater Puppet.
[109:35.19]One hit.
[109:48.74]Okay, so let's check out this.
[109:50.70]There's a down by me.
[109:52.78]To the left is some runes.
[109:55.92]There might be a boss down underground in the Purified Runes.
[110:00.56]Just grabbing the moonfire.
[110:02.00]There's a legendary item here for me.
[110:03.62]Not for you.
[110:05.60]There's also the teleporter in the chest up here in that tower.
[110:08.16]I don't remember where that takes you.
[110:09.46]You know what I'm talking about?
[110:12.08]I think so.
[110:17.63]That's good.
[110:18.19]Do I have two Axe of Godfrey's now?
[110:23.31]No.
[110:27.52]Holy shit.
[110:30.87]Yes, I look over at chat when I pick up a legendary item to see how many fog champs there are to determine if I'm going to say, whoa, what the fuck is awesome.
[110:44.95]Whoa, what the fuck?
[110:51.12]Margot's shackle.
[110:52.28]What the hell is that?
[110:54.30]At Margot or Morgott's fight, if you use that item, it'll make Morgott go, he'll slam into the ground for like five seconds.
[111:03.41]Oh, so it's like Inuyasha when you say, sit boy.
[111:19.13]Make it rain.
[111:21.07]the answer to that is yes I think so do you think that that implies in the lore that margit is actually isiokide I think I think he's not it's not from here oh okay alright you I'm killing this I hate her
[112:00.39]No.
[112:00.71]Can't walk onto her.
[112:13.45]Okay.
[112:13.81]Now we're going to go over here.
[112:15.89]Is something else for us to look at?
[112:39.11]Okay.
[112:40.33]What is over here?
[112:42.69]That's just... I can't get out of my head now.
[112:49.03]I just keep thinking about it.
[112:50.15]Isn't there something here?
[112:53.34]I'm really busting the lore down.
[112:58.86]I just see it from a different angle.
[113:02.50]What else is here?
[113:05.75]Remember, why do you look like that?
[113:10.02]You know, people ask that, and it's just like, I don't know, dude.
[113:15.92]My skin and muscle and sinew up here formed a person's face.
[113:20.87]I don't know.
[113:23.57]Sounds like something an alien would say.
[113:30.18]Bro.
[113:35.84]We got the Mariner.
[113:36.94]It's the Crucible Knight down here.
[113:38.90]Oh.
[113:42.33]What do the Mariners usually drop that you need?
[113:44.77]What's their thing?
[113:45.68]Death Root, I think.
[113:48.96]I think they're one of the sources of Death Root.
[113:52.34]Sounds right.
[113:56.87]Dude.
[113:57.27]Dude, you stink at this game.
[114:01.01]Distractive.
[114:02.19]He is distractive.
[114:16.01]Why is my weapon not equipped?
[114:30.82]What a great enemy.
[114:33.38]Three lumps of flesh.
[114:34.64]Let's fucking go.
[114:42.92]larval tier oh cool you don't need mine anymore you mooch are you feeling okay yes I thought it was uh in my uber the song what if god was one of us was playing
[115:09.47]And I never heard this lyric before, but it says a slob like one of us.
[115:14.57]Yeah, it's what if God was one of us?
[115:18.83]Just a slob like one of us.
[115:22.25]I got the letter from Volcano Manor.
[115:23.93]I don't know if that was something we needed.
[115:27.63]I don't think so.
[115:34.44]I have enough to level up, I think.
[115:38.48]I need one of those.
[115:39.06]I need to go back, look at remembrances and.
[115:42.95]I gotta make a lot of decisions.
[115:45.91]Did you ever talk to the Finger Maiden next to the Two Fingers?
[115:51.26]Yes.
[115:52.34]Okay.
[115:52.54]Because she does sell a bunch of stuff.
[115:54.28]Yes, she does.
[115:55.14]She sold some pretty good things to me.
[115:59.48]I kind of want to go to the upside down.
[116:02.42]Yeah.
[116:03.26]No, I'm going to disconnect you.
[116:04.50]I'm going to go get the waypoint.
[116:05.34]You go do your thing.
[116:06.22]Alright.
[116:06.46]Alright.
[116:06.72]Just boot me because I've got a major decision I have to make here.
[116:09.60]I have banished you.
[116:11.00]I'll see you in an hour.
[116:13.00]Chat.
[116:14.42]I can't see.
[116:15.08]Chat.
[116:16.31]I don't know why I'm doing that today.
[116:18.55]I don't know.
[116:19.07]I don't know.
[116:19.97]But anyways.
[116:24.52]I'm going to make this decision one more time.
[116:27.98]I need to have the final build.
[116:32.15]And I genuinely don't know what that is.
[116:35.31]I could dual-weld the Omen Cleavers.
[116:39.19]God damn it.
[116:41.37]You know what?
[116:41.99]Just to make him feel better, just hit me a few times.
[116:47.80]Ah!
[116:48.56]Oh, man!
[116:49.96]Almost got me.
[116:52.42]Ooh, I did a lot of damage, but it's alright.
[116:53.84]You're doing good though.
[116:54.45]You're doing pretty good.
[116:56.87]Watch it.
[116:59.57]Oh!
[117:00.31]How'd you do that move?
[117:03.25]You're pretty good at this game.
[117:11.84]Alright, there's no more jokes?
[117:13.84]No more joking around?
[117:19.20]no more jokes you gotta pick your belt you gotta pick your belt and see if you're gonna do a weld but uh two big hands jumping claw attacks I know it's really pretty good it's really good
[117:43.24]But are you a big enough man to do it?
[117:45.34]That's the question.
[117:46.08]The question is, what am I gonna do?
[117:48.90]Are you... thick enough and tight enough?
[117:53.46]I missed it.
[117:55.36]I missed it.
[117:55.92]Alright, um... What a shitty thing of...
[117:58.22]What?! !
[118:11.06]Oh, you're going to have a recusant finger.
[118:16.06]Or a gold scarab?
[118:20.38]I don't know what you're doing, but it doesn't sound like you're respeccing.
[118:24.20]I have a remembrance, and I'm just checking to see what they are, and it's not remembrance weapon randomization.
[118:29.34]It's any item randomization.
[118:31.71]Yeah.
[118:34.81]The gold scarab, though, is this something that is... I feel like that... How good is that?
[118:41.37]I should probably just take the scarab, but it's a talisman, right?
[118:48.04]It's 20% more?
[118:54.74]Is it more or additional?
[118:57.48]Because the more multipliers, you know what I'm saying?
[118:59.90]Holy shit.
[119:12.66]Somebody just called you a POE player.
[119:15.50]I am.
[119:15.82]Is that why you said that?
[119:18.55]That is why I said that.
[119:21.69]It's very important if it's more or not.
[119:25.35]You gotta know that.
[119:28.39]Gaming.
[119:31.48]Alright.
[119:32.72]What the heck am I gonna do?
[119:34.88]Let me look.
[119:36.48]I'm just gonna run around and pick up bonfires.
[119:42.76]I'm going to do a poll because I want chat to decide.
[119:49.46]We have Prelate's Inferno Crozier.
[119:58.07]This is just a straight up strength weapon.
[120:02.27]Big hammer.
[120:04.97]We also have... I'm not going to put that on the list.
[120:07.45]You'll pick it and it'll ruin my game.
[120:09.83]We have the...
[120:12.18]Double Omenkiller Swing Dual Weld.
[120:20.88]Double Omenkiller.
[120:24.12]We've got Axe of Godfrey.
[120:31.67]The Axe of Godfrey.
[120:46.38]Make your choice.
[120:54.45]Do you hear anything?
[120:56.83]Is the music playing?
[121:29.20]two big knives is funny but also the axe of godfrey this could be funny too because I'll keep mispronouncing the name I'm gonna say like oh like acts of goat fry and everyone's gonna laugh that's funny I'll mispronounce it a few times
[121:59.12]I can't alt-tab because it might crash the game, so what is it at?
[122:13.05]Dude, Godfrey won?
[122:14.65]Oh, shit.
[122:15.23]Cool.
[122:17.43]What about the Godslayer Colossal Sword?
[122:27.22]You mean this thing?
[122:30.78]That's like a deck strength, faith, I don't know.
[122:41.47]It's the best sword?
[122:42.75]Yeah.
[122:44.25]Dual welding is up.
[122:45.69]Okay, so that's what we're doing.
[122:47.13]Double omen wins.
[122:52.13]Double omen killers.
[122:53.73]Oh, shit.
[122:54.51]Alright.
[122:57.18]Okay.
[122:59.10]Ster?
[123:01.74]Let me get your opinion.
[123:02.80]Your opinion's worth 5% of the vote.
[123:05.78]That honestly, in the grand scheme of things, is not much.
[123:09.24]It actually is.
[123:10.04]Is it close?
[123:10.78]It's pretty close.
[123:13.02]Double Omenkiller.
[123:14.96]Dual Welding.
[123:16.82]Strength.
[123:17.89]Strong guy.
[123:19.21]If you do that...
[123:22.50]gonna vote against it like I want you to do that but I'm gonna vote against it if you keep saying dual welding like dual wielding great Omenkiller cleavers okay acts of goat fry who the is goat fry it's funny okay free go pray goat fry okay yeah and what's special about that axe I said it kind of funnily
[123:52.60]That's it.
[123:53.06]That's the reason you want to use it.
[123:55.22]Or the big red hammer.
[124:03.06]Oh, the charge one.
[124:04.76]Yes.
[124:05.75]That one's kind of fun.
[124:08.23]I think practically the omen killers is going to be the strongest one.
[124:12.57]Okay, done.
[124:17.22]And I think when you fight Malenia with jump attacks with those, you'll be happy to stick her face in the mud.
[124:24.10]Oh, wow.
[124:26.19]These look like two turkey legs.
[124:27.61]Alright.
[124:27.97]So are these somber?
[124:29.43]I hope they're not.
[124:31.25]It's not.
[124:35.51]Oh, shit.
[124:35.83]I have to do it to both of them.
[124:38.01]Oh, no.
[124:43.55]Oh, no, I've picked up a couple of sombers, but I need regular.
[124:47.09]Oh, then I can look and see what I got.
[124:51.41]Dude, I will trade you like all of my sombers because I'm not going to be using them anymore.
[124:55.67]You just have them all.
[124:59.21]I can have all of yours.
[125:00.43]Dude, you are ruining the economy right now.
[125:03.48]How many of these do I need?
[125:04.18]I need a lot of these.
[125:05.18]I'm just going to buy 200 of them.
[125:08.70]I have one ancient.
[125:11.89]Okay.
[125:12.51]How many of these do I need?
[125:13.19]I need 24 of these.
[125:14.73]Jesus.
[125:18.41]And I could potentially upgrade it for you because I only need one of each.
[125:22.62]And I need 24 of these.
[125:24.24]Right?
[125:28.08]What do you mean, no?
[125:31.84]Wait, stop, stop, stop.
[125:32.64]I need 12 of each.
[125:35.81]Why did you say 24?
[125:37.83]A bunch of you said 24.
[125:45.92]24 for both?
[125:46.24]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[125:47.14]24 was correct.
[125:51.46]Yeah, I was right.
[125:54.50]Why is everybody yelling at me?
[125:55.80]It's 12 per weapon.
[125:56.96]Yeah.
[125:57.62]What are you guys talking about?
[125:58.80]I had it right.
[126:07.22]Here we go.
[126:29.91]Yeah, you should let me upgrade those.
[126:32.67]What?
[126:38.23]So I need Smithing Stone threes now.
[126:45.04]I explained this early on.
[126:45.98]This is like the one randomizer Cheeto thing is that there's an option in the randomizer to only need one stone per upgrade.
[126:52.40]And he has it and I don't.
[126:54.98]Yeah.
[126:58.33]Because I've played randomizer before and it was just looking for stones for eight hours and it was not fun.
[127:08.73]What's the highest scaling thing that I have here?
[127:12.40]Fire?
[127:12.70]Fire?
[127:14.26]Flaming Strike.
[127:15.57]Flaming the Redmanes.
[127:19.07]Wild Strikes.
[127:25.85]And Flame of Roar.
[127:36.59]Oh, because I see what you're saying.
[127:39.71]Well, I just wasted like 30,000 souls for no reason.
[127:46.19]So you could get these just like plus 25 each.
[127:49.97]Yeah, if you have like, I just need one of each stone per upgrade.
[127:53.05]So when it costs you six stones, it would cost me one.
[127:57.05]Shit.
[127:58.19]Okay, so I need, so I could do one.
[128:01.61]Do you have any spinning stone threes?
[128:05.21]I have like, yeah.
[128:07.16]So we're not going to get in a position where this is going to completely screw me over and I'm not going to be able to take them.
[128:13.27]what about the finger I have a plus 10 somber weapon is that is that okay honestly I have no idea I would assume so but so if I I I don't want to get this wrong because last time this all look I got a plus 10 Magma Wyrm scale sword that's okay I'm fine okay uh I'm gonna give you these both these weapons Ster please get them both to plus 25 if you could
[128:40.51]Okay, I only have one ancient.
[128:42.49]I can get them pretty high.
[128:46.50]Okay, I duplicated my Elden Beast Remembrance.
[128:50.00]So I'm going to use all my souls on your new company that you're launching called Dual Welding Omen Killers.
[128:58.56]I thought you told me never to use that.
[129:00.08]I thought you said no, don't do that anymore.
[129:03.01]I don't think you can stop.
[129:05.23]People are freaking out.
[129:05.89]They're saying don't.
[129:06.55]You're going to lose them again.
[129:09.49]What's the real thing here?
[129:10.63]Oh, do you have a plus 25?
[129:18.56]Yeah.
[129:24.42]I double duplicated my Elden Beast from Ember.
[129:29.31]I'm a double duper.
[129:30.13]How's that?
[129:39.07]Is this good?
[129:41.05]I need a lot of endurance.
[129:43.71]Go to at least 50 strength.
[129:53.20]Is that okay?
[130:00.36]50? 50?
[130:08.55]It was 12 decks to put these on.
[130:14.36]That should be okay.
[130:19.54]26 Endurance.
[130:20.02]20 Endurance?
[130:23.98]No way.
[130:25.12]I think this is fine.
[130:31.51]Alright.
[130:34.75]We're in a good spot.
[130:46.14]Now I just need to upgrade these and I'm going to be an absolute slaughter.
[130:50.44]Let me see what it looks like when I swing it.
[131:00.07]Oh my goodness.
[131:02.95]Yes!
[131:06.25]Alright, this is worth it now.
[131:07.69]For sure.
[131:09.67]Make sure the jump attack thing is on.
[131:10.89]Apparently I didn't double dupe it.
[131:17.78]I need more talisman slots.
[131:27.83]Try higher poise armor if I have any.
[131:35.41]Still in medium.
[131:43.34]Man, I am making so much progress right now.
[131:46.54]I'm glad.
[131:47.10]It's actually good to hear.
[131:49.20]I am glad to hear that.
[131:51.03]I am untethered.
[131:59.11]That's heavy, though.
[132:04.95]Look at me.
[132:20.95]Alright, Ster, I am ready for me to come to your world for you to drop a plus 25 on the ground for me to see if I can pick that plus 25 up off the ground, and then for you to then take my items, upgrade them to plus 25, and then give them back.
[132:36.15]Or at least 24.
[132:36.99]Alright.
[132:43.96]You look nasty.
[132:45.44]Yep.
[132:51.86]Opening my world.
[133:01.27]Here we go.
[133:11.67]Why do you got a bird feeder on your head?
[133:20.74]stop dude okay I am dropping you my only good weapon that I've been using all game to prove that you can see it to prove that I can pick it up off the ground and then you're not going to give it back I need some collateral just put it on the ground
[133:49.98]There it is.
[133:51.02]Can you see it?
[133:51.46]You don't need to pick it up.
[133:52.65]I can pick it up.
[133:54.61]Plus 25 magic longsword.
[133:57.43]There it is.
[133:59.33]And I'm using it.
[134:01.77]How?
[134:03.25]Oh, right.
[134:03.55]Okay.
[134:05.15]Okay.
[134:06.13]So now, very cool.
[134:07.82]I am very happy about this.
[134:09.06]Time to destroy the rest of this game.
[134:14.10]I had a plus 10 scalesword.
[134:18.60]Now we're going to see what happens when I get the real shit.
[134:23.98]Ashes of War are applied to... Wait, is this okay?
[134:27.15]Can you just give me my item back?
[134:30.85]Bruh.
[134:34.07]Okay, so you're giving me your Ogre Sword.
[134:37.47]This is scary.
[134:38.23]I kind of don't like this.
[134:41.82]You're taking the only thing I have to make this playthrough.
[134:45.05]You just took the only thing I have.
[134:46.77]That's true.
[134:47.23]Okay, here you go.
[134:50.15]There's one.
[134:52.75]And here's the other one.
[135:04.38]Cool.
[135:06.53]Okay.
[135:08.33]I banish you.
[135:13.98]Okay, let's go to the road.
[135:23.02]Tried, won't let me.
[135:24.86]Doing that thing again.
[135:32.27]Try again.
[135:44.92]Try again.
[135:56.29]Try again.
[135:56.57]Yes.
[136:04.45]I cannot wait.
[136:08.49]Back alley deals for sword upgrades.
[136:24.63]You look like one of those street performers that paint themselves silver and stand around all day.
[136:30.73]Do you have smithing eights?
[136:33.07]I'm going to need those.
[136:38.88]I don't.
[136:39.56]I have smithing six.
[136:40.68]It's the highest I have.
[136:49.54]Hold on.
[136:49.78]Let me complete that thought.
[136:56.80]I got them to 16 and 18, but I am out of... Smithing Stone 6.
[137:08.69]Oh, I have those.
[137:09.97]Just drop all the Smithing Stones you have.
[137:14.17]Past 6.
[137:15.76]All of them?
[137:17.12]Or just singles?
[137:21.84]I only have up to 6.
[137:24.69]Plus 18.
[137:25.29]That's fine.
[137:26.28]Do you understand what we're doing and why I need them?
[137:29.28]Just drop them.
[137:30.46]I only have plus sixes, though.
[137:32.18]Drop them, then.
[137:33.20]You told me you needed plus sevens.
[137:37.74]I'm upgrading two weapons I needed a lot.
[137:49.22]There.
[137:51.86]There's every Smithing Stone I own.
[137:55.04]I do feel like this is some kind of a scam.
[137:58.15]Like, you're going to be like, oh, thanks.
[138:00.05]And you're going to pick those all up and disconnect.
[138:02.01]And we're never going to talk ever again.
[138:05.05]Well, I got them both to 19.
[138:06.71]And we need sevens.
[138:15.09]Just pick all those up because you probably need them eventually.
[138:17.75]For some reason.
[138:19.65]Yeah, when you switch builds again.
[138:26.97]Streamer beats Elden Ring only using the kick.
[138:31.66]There they are.
[138:32.82]There's your items.
[138:33.44]Get them.
[138:33.70]Get them quick.
[138:34.30]You're about to crash.
[138:34.86]I know.
[138:35.12]They despawn.
[138:36.08]Oh, shit.
[138:36.58]That actually could happen.
[138:42.52]How am I?
[138:44.18]268 plus 232.
[138:45.96]And it's a double?
[138:49.78]Do you have the claw talisman for jump attacks?
[138:51.70]I do.
[138:53.76]But I'm not going to use it.
[138:55.65]Because you're scared?
[138:57.35]No, because I want the extra runes for now.
[139:02.22]He's scared.
[139:04.32]What a fucking baby.
[139:05.48]Shut up.
[139:06.84]I'm not.
[139:08.28]He's scared of the jump attack.
[139:09.82]Shut up.
[139:11.54]Shut up, idiot.
[139:13.52]You're an idiot.
[139:14.26]Shut up, stupid.
[139:16.50]I'm not scared of your idiot.
[139:18.24]Alright.
[139:19.90]I'm ready to play the video game.
[139:22.47]That's fantastic news for people who like watching you play video games.
[139:26.15]So let's go back to I'm imagining I'm going to follow you to put the artist shack and then we're going to go into the upside down world.
[139:32.82]Oh, no, I can.
[139:38.05]I think you think you can accept the votes places you haven't been.
[139:41.19]I cannot.
[139:45.47]I have to go to the artist shack.
[139:47.17]Wasn't there a way we did this before?
[139:48.69]You totally joined me in a place you hadn't been to before.
[139:50.91]I think it's because I... Oh, because we were disconnected and you never... Oh.
[139:55.61]You were there and I just connected to you.
[140:00.31]Well, then you... We have to go from... The artist shack is right there.
[140:05.91]Is it not right there?
[140:07.15]No, you have to go down a hill.
[140:08.34]We got to go to Academy Gate Town and then go up the hill.
[140:13.50]Fight Malenia.
[140:14.10]Fight Malenia.
[140:15.98]Who?
[140:17.88]I'm gonna fight Millenia until these are both plus 20.
[140:21.58]I told her to lose my number and she cried.
[140:24.79]Okay, let's go.
[140:36.32]I've got my final build.
[141:01.05]You look really cool.
[141:02.79]Where your cape is like fluttering.
[141:08.41]You look pretty cool too.
[141:12.52]The way your smirk goes up on one side of your face to reveal your.
[141:17.10]Deep level of confidence that you have.
[141:22.06]So let me.
[141:23.86]I want this now.
[141:31.10]I want it now.
[141:33.70]That's you.
[141:42.69]That's you, man.
[141:43.49]Alright, Wonka, how much for a golden goose?
[141:47.83]No, they're not for sale.
[141:49.74]Okay, but how much?
[142:01.07]Alright, here we are.
[142:03.11]Let's do the upside down level.
[142:08.86]Oh.
[142:13.34]Having some trouble?
[142:14.70]Kind of.
[142:16.44]My health bar is girthy.
[142:17.66]Yeah, I actually like doubled my health from when we were fighting Malenia.
[142:26.41]Where are you?
[142:28.17]Alright, are we ready to turn this upside down or do you want to clear it first?
[142:32.42]um do you does there there's not even a boss here is there a reason just to I don't think so there are items yeah yeah but they're like not good items and we're like
[142:58.97]We're pretty beefy.
[142:59.41]We're so huge that we don't even need them.
[143:03.41]We are pretty beefy.
[143:13.78]At this stage, I'm not going to find the Axe of Godfrey and go and then restart my whole character.
[143:22.40]Oh, hey, check it out, man.
[143:25.50]Bet you wish you were this cool.
[143:30.72]Yeah, that's my great rune.
[143:40.82]Yeah, I can do it too.
[143:43.04]You have one?
[143:43.54]It's kind of weird that you would lie.
[143:52.00]My power is your power.
[143:55.67]I'm the one who passed it down to you.
[144:04.08]This isn't upside down first.
[144:06.34]You need the elevator to go up to go in the upside down area.
[144:09.40]I just fucking fell.
[144:12.32]This is the normal.
[144:13.10]Wait, why is this normal?
[144:14.76]Come down!
[144:17.41]Come!
[144:18.27]Come!
[144:18.91]Why is it right side up?
[144:24.29]You have to go... Wait.
[144:27.59]Do we go through that window?
[144:28.51]No.
[144:31.17]Let me go through that window.
[144:32.79]Yeah, something's wrong.
[144:33.83]You need the hourglass.
[144:34.65]We just put it on there.
[144:40.70]I think I took the hourglass off.
[144:42.74]You took it off?
[144:45.22]I think you put it on and then I took it off.
[144:48.62]Wait, why did you take it off?
[144:52.63]I don't know.
[144:53.03]Come down here.
[144:54.19]You walked up to the thing after I did that and you picked it up.
[144:57.95]yeah why did you do that I didn't realize that you did it because I didn't think that you had it it's going back upside down again okay I put it back on okay it's back up it's yeah alright what the fuck it flipped everyone they all died yeah it just killed everybody
[145:28.51]This guy's still here, though.
[145:35.44]I loved this area on my first playthrough.
[145:38.42]When that guy's down there just casting shit at you.
[145:40.62]Oh, that's right.
[145:41.38]It's so awful.
[145:42.82]I loved it. ...
[146:00.27]Watch out, there's a giant gargle.
[146:03.69]How can I not hit this?
[146:07.15]Watch out for the gargle.
[146:13.40]Alright, we have to go around.
[146:16.22]I think the gargoyle is going to fall off.
[146:18.38]I would say we probably should bait the gargoyle to attack so it just falls straight down.
[146:22.38]Sounds good to me.
[146:29.36]I'm just going to continue this way.
[146:31.74]It can't even fit over here.
[146:37.92]3, 2, 1, you're going to die.
[146:39.04]What are you doing?
[146:45.81]I'm kind of in trouble.
[146:56.85]He's still alive down there.
[146:59.79]How is he still alive?
[147:01.23]Okay.
[147:01.67]Well, he'll be a problem in about five minutes.
[147:03.97]Holy shit.
[147:07.53]There's a thousand damage.
[147:31.36]This is so overwhelming.
[147:33.30]Oh, this guy's still alive.
[147:38.71]He just stabbed himself in the chest.
[147:41.79]Well, I guess he wins.
[147:42.57]Oh, I got Erdtree Heal.
[147:46.25]He just stabbed himself through the heart.
[147:50.82]I got Erdtree Heal if you want it.
[147:53.64]I spec'd off the healing.
[147:58.46]That's a big drop.
[148:07.01]We're fine.
[148:09.93]One problem, though, is we have an issue in a minute once we get down a little further.
[148:15.04]Ooh, items.
[148:27.80]Are you blocking me?
[148:33.22]You said, ooh, items.
[148:34.24]I turned to look.
[148:38.49]Oh, it's the people that fell when you turned it.
[148:50.24]Bang.
[148:54.68]Items up here?
[148:55.42]Yeah.
[148:56.68]Yeah, he landed in an unfortunate spot.
[148:59.98]Yes, he did.
[149:00.52]I thought I was going to kill him.
[149:05.01]He's full health.
[149:05.67]He's dumb.
[149:09.81]I feel like he's just going to baseball swing one of us off this ledge.
[149:20.78]Yeah.
[149:33.66]You ready?
[149:35.20]I guess as ready as we're going to be.
[149:41.63]Who goes first?
[149:52.54]Ow.
[149:54.64]Oh, God, you guys went down.
[149:55.72]What?
[149:56.04]Oh, we went down.
[149:57.14]You touched the thing.
[149:59.26]Well, what do I suppose?
[150:02.62]He's going to be still.
[150:03.50]Wait, can we crush him?
[150:05.28]Wait, what?
[150:06.90]Oh, fuck.
[150:08.09]He's not coming down, right?
[150:13.00]He's dead.
[150:15.16]Is he dead?
[150:20.77]How do I make this go back up?
[150:23.15]You can't step on him again?
[150:24.41]No.
[150:28.17]Is there a lever?
[150:29.43]Can you pull something?
[150:33.24]I don't think so.
[150:33.86]Let me see.
[150:39.04]Well, shit.
[150:48.26]Maybe... Is there no lever up here?
[150:50.44]There's no lever, I don't think.
[150:51.54]There's a bonfire outside, though.
[150:56.28]Hold on.
[150:57.10]Yeah, what happens if you reset the area and you touched it?
[150:59.22]Like, if you die down there?
[151:01.11]Oh, no.
[151:02.17]I'm sorry.
[151:02.59]I just did... There's a cutscene now.
[151:10.85]I forget what the heck is down here.
[151:12.74]This is how you go over to the other part of the tower.
[151:21.87]The howling tree?
[151:24.01]No, this is the thing, the one where you were talking about.
[151:27.73]Where you get invaded.
[151:31.25]So, yeah, if I step on this, I think the elevator might just be there for you.
[151:34.15]Let's see.
[151:34.93]Oh, I spawned here with you.
[151:36.51]Oh.
[151:37.97]Nice cutscene teleport, man.
[151:45.16]Wow.
[151:45.88]So am I just dumping strength?
[151:47.04]What a bit of luck.
[151:47.90]Dump in strength or dump into health?
[151:52.09]Get health to like 50 first?
[151:54.23]Yeah.
[151:54.45]Or should I get strength to... What's your health at?
[151:57.03]What's the vigor?
[151:58.57]40.
[152:01.05]What's your strength at?
[152:02.27]50.
[152:04.91]I'll get this to 50 and then just dump everything into strength.
[152:06.63]You're a growing boy.
[152:07.83]Look at how strong I am.
[152:09.97]You're really strong.
[152:10.79]Oh my god.
[152:11.79]Hmm.
[152:14.13]Yeah, I'm a Flintstone kid.
[152:20.69]Yeah, you can walk.
[152:23.77]You're gonna bug out the cutscene.
[152:30.05]Watch out!
[152:30.72]Snail in the road!
[152:32.88]Why am I minus- Oh, Gen Z doesn't get that one, dude.
[152:41.66]Oh, that's true.
[152:53.57]Doesn't it happen here?
[152:54.32]This is not where it happens.
[152:57.74]I believe so.
[152:58.74]On the other side of the door.
[153:05.41]And I hope it's some really weird enemies.
[153:14.38]If you crouch, they can't see you.
[153:16.72]It was the snail.
[153:17.60]You said crouching was useless.
[153:19.12]Wait, it was the snail?
[153:20.18]Did we just run by that stupid... The snail was the boss.
[153:28.10]It didn't go into the cutscene, though.
[153:32.25]Do you have to kill the snail to activate it?
[153:40.27]This elevator takes so long, though.
[154:01.01]Oh.
[154:01.63]But.
[154:09.19]Oh.
[154:13.32]We're Dawn's great run.
[154:15.24]You got another great run?
[154:16.58]Yeah, I'm loaded.
[154:23.23]Okay.
[154:23.51]So we jump here.
[154:25.91]We go back and we kill the snail.
[154:27.39]We go back and we kill the snail.
[154:30.27]You guys just... What are you thinking?
[154:35.74]What's going through your head?
[154:36.68]We gotta kill the snail.
[154:40.00]It's bugged again.
[154:40.72]I tried.
[154:44.06]No, he doesn't deserve it.
[154:45.37]This is not the right tower.
[154:46.41]Okay.
[154:52.11]You're thinking of a different bridge.
[154:54.21]Yeah, I think we just have this tower now.
[154:56.87]Okay, then where are we going next?
[155:00.73]Well... We were going up this path.
[155:03.98]There's still an Erdtree.
[155:05.58]We could do the snow zone.
[155:10.06]Use your medallion and get up there.
[155:13.84]We could do some more... Where do you do that?
[155:18.12]We have to go through the capital and go down that road and we go up the lift and go to the snow zone.
[155:29.25]The snail is supposed to be a noble.
[155:31.29]Oh, that's right.
[155:31.95]Yeah.
[155:32.33]No, that is where one of the nobles is.
[155:33.57]Go to the bridge.
[155:34.79]The snail is going to have boss loot.
[155:39.61]Oh, fucking hell.
[155:45.05]Boss loot.
[155:46.61]Boss loot.
[155:47.45]Boss loot.
[155:48.27]Boss loot.
[155:49.17]Boss loot.
[155:50.17]Boss loot.
[155:50.49]We can also apparently go to Radon's Tower, which I think we have a portal to.
[156:01.83]What major thing have we not done besides the snow zone?
[156:06.14]We're pretty... We're close.
[156:08.42]We're close to being able to beat the game.
[156:10.94]We never went down to Moog.
[156:12.62]We didn't do Moog.
[156:15.32]But do we really want to do Moog?
[156:18.02]I forget where you even enter that area.
[156:20.66]The Kalid's Tower is Redan.
[156:26.61]Oh, my God.
[156:27.57]It really was.
[156:29.45]What?
[156:30.93]Okay.
[156:31.27]There's so many items.
[156:35.25]Hold on.
[156:35.57]I just got... What was that?
[156:42.33]Man, that guy was loaded.
[156:48.31]I got another piece of the Crucible Knight.
[156:50.81]Holy shit.
[157:00.62]Now I look pretty cool.
[157:07.32]Okay, so... Yeah, we can either go up the lift, we can do...
[157:14.09]um do we have any blue keys we could do one of the um the teleporters uh what are those keys called they're like a blue stone sword or something they have a special name I have one I have imbued sword key which one of those is unsealed yeah that is it unseal ascending gate I know one of them takes you to the sewers right
[157:43.80]One goes to a random spot in Nokron.
[157:48.17]One goes to Farum Azula.
[157:50.87]And one goes to... Yeah, I don't know where the last one goes.
[157:56.48]Farum Azula is a, you know, that's also an option.
[157:59.98]It's far away in Farum Azula.
[158:01.10]It's like in the distance, though.
[158:02.32]It's not the actual zone.
[158:03.86]Oh.
[158:04.26]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[158:07.33]Oh, it's the tutorial zone.
[158:11.87]Where you go, where you fight that sentry thing, the scion, whatever it is.
[158:17.32]Okay, let's just go there and none of us remember which one goes where, so let's just use one.
[158:22.08]Cool, I'm down for that.
[158:24.61]Whoops, I voted Ronnie's Rise.
[158:26.31]That's not.
[158:27.41]That's not correct.
[158:28.39]It's down here at the four belfries.
[158:42.17]Vote rejected.
[158:42.93]Because I vote... I voted the wrong place.
[158:53.31]There we go.
[159:00.18]I have the hiccups.
[159:00.94]Do something.
[159:03.86]Dude, for like a... Strawberry, strawberry, strawberry, strawberry, strawberry.
[159:06.56]Strawberry, strawberry, strawberry.
[159:08.40]Bet you don't have them anymore.
[159:10.44]For like a month.
[159:12.73]Every time I started my stream, I got hiccups.
[159:17.56]It was uncanny.
[159:19.80]Like, stream start, hiccups.
[159:22.32]Weird.
[159:22.54]Alright, so which one do you want to do?
[159:26.89]Um... This one on the left.
[159:31.21]I don't remember which one this one is.
[159:32.91]There's one that's awful.
[159:34.67]And it literally is just a tiny little part of Nokron that's one Crucible Knight and it's awful.
[159:40.07]Yeah, I think that's the one to our left right now.
[159:42.41]Because I remember fighting that guy a lot.
[159:48.04]I think I had to go back through that portal every time.
[159:55.98]We didn't do the Lake of Rat.
[159:57.08]No, that's another underground area we haven't been to.
[160:01.50]It's the chopper.
[160:05.16]What?
[160:06.22]It's the chopper.
[160:09.84]Oh, your host.
[160:10.46]You can see it.
[160:10.98]You get to see the movie before I do.
[160:13.38]Yeah, I'm in the movie theater already.
[160:16.58]What was this in the very beginning?
[160:17.88]I was like a berserker.
[160:31.31]Ah, it was.
[160:51.02]I'm just I'm just spamming L1.
[160:53.92]OK, we're good.
[160:55.04]This bunch of items.
[161:02.16]OK.
[161:03.52]So I got I got Twiggy cracked here.
[161:05.72]That sounds like the name of some fucked up YouTube channel.
[161:11.79]uh we go back into the church right isn't this a way to get up and walk around and look around right and I don't think there's anything else here oh no no no come over here I remember there's something here there's a um there's a spot did you have did you ever come back here yeah there's a spot up here I think on the ledge where you have to jump from it I think
[161:50.08]got him that kind of hurt my feelings I think we actually can get up in the church though yeah but there's no reason to who cares but there's items this is random stuff it could be a lord's ruin you don't know oh my god who cares
[162:22.13]I do.
[162:23.25]Now, how do you get to the rolled route from the capital?
[162:31.95]What?
[162:35.29]Wait, why is she alive?
[162:37.15]Oh, yeah.
[162:42.16]Oh, yeah.
[162:43.04]Oh, yeah.
[162:55.58]There's an... Let me just see if it's a legendary.
[162:57.42]I'll... Is it... I don't know.
[162:59.22]It's in a chest.
[163:03.37]It could be a legendary.
[163:06.93]It's like the mushrooms growing out of her fucking head.
[163:17.25]Yes, I don't.
[163:17.87]I know, but look.
[163:19.57]Letter from Volcano Manor.
[163:22.19]That's why you come up here.
[163:23.87]That's why you explore.
[163:25.26]Now we can do Rykard.
[163:27.08]I have that.
[163:30.04]I mentioned it earlier and I said I don't remember.
[163:32.06]I got letter from Volcano Manor.
[163:33.40]I don't know if we needed that or not.
[163:35.66]It was like an hour ago.
[163:42.90]Okay.
[163:46.59]you did right card that wasn't right card yeah that wasn't the real right card okay so you want to do right card then we could give her letters and yeah let's see what's down there why it might as well we're gonna hit a point here very soon where we're gonna unlock the giant area we're gonna do the giant and then we can just end the game you need the thing to burn in the bowl I think you need like an ember or something
[164:15.96]I think you just need... I think you just need... What's her name?
[164:20.08]Malenia?
[164:20.46]I think you just need her up there.
[164:22.70]You sit at the bonfire up in the big, like, crucible thing.
[164:26.34]I don't think you need an item.
[164:34.13]Alright.
[164:35.53]And the letter over.
[164:36.77]Join.
[164:37.01]Join.
[164:46.40]Thank you.
[164:46.92]Okay, so now we have to go do an invasion, right?
[164:53.30]Wait, we're going to get a different item every time we do this.
[164:55.66]Yeah.
[165:00.96]There may be some flaws to the plan.
[165:06.82]I have two of them.
[165:07.66]I have Riley the Idol and I have Great Horned Tragoth.
[165:14.67]I don't know the words you're saying.
[165:16.16]Go into where the letter is, because there's three letters.
[165:30.70]Who are you?
[165:33.58]What does your letter say?
[165:35.08]The letter you have.
[165:38.61]The assassination missions are optional for Rykard.
[165:43.22]I can't find it.
[165:44.64]But so then how do we get down to Rykard if we have... I thought you did those three and they're like, oh, yes, you can go talk to our lord.
[165:54.03]I have the red letter.
[165:55.23]I don't know how I... It's past Malenia.
[166:02.91]Juno Haslo, Knight of Blood.
[166:05.47]Alright, so wait, I have the other two.
[166:07.46]There's only three, right?
[166:09.18]Well, then also that enemy is going to be randomized.
[166:13.47]oh yeah that's true let's make our way up the rolled route let's make our way alright east I'm going to east capital rampart or capital rampart which one of these I I think you have to do the avenue balcony and then run down the road I think you're right yes no you're right because you open you open the door and you walk through yeah
[166:46.74]Just kill Millenia.
[166:48.68]Forehead.
[166:49.04]Who?
[166:51.96]Check your, uh, your physique, Tears.
[166:54.26]Feels okay, man.
[166:57.66]Chat just wants you guys to get mad at Millenia.
[166:59.98]Yeah.
[167:01.02]You guys want us just to go there and get stuck for four hours and, like, us make a bunch of cartoon sound effects.
[167:06.67]And me to bite my mic stand and, like, smash my face into my microphone.
[167:09.99]Yeah, and to, like, bite my lip so hard that, like, my lip bleeds a little bit.
[167:16.75]Not that way?
[167:17.49]Do we have to jump off the edge over here?
[167:19.20]There's a path that has... It's the path that has the Urge Tree avatar on it.
[167:26.64]Yeah, this is... Come with me.
[167:29.04]Are you sure it's not over here?
[167:29.78]No, come with me.
[167:30.64]No, come with me.
[167:31.40]I think you can jump down.
[167:32.91]Yeah, no, come with me.
[167:36.11]Yeah, I got some new ones.
[167:36.81]I'll look in a minute.
[167:37.71]Once you get to a better spot.
[167:39.09]Other way.
[167:40.55]Well, you make a decision here.
[167:43.03]Oh, I didn't see you actually followed me.
[167:44.61]Now you use your run speed ninjutsu.
[167:47.85]We just have to go to the big door at the end, right?
[167:51.09]Yes.
[167:56.05]Soap Andy.
[168:00.50]I like this, but that was.
[168:03.30]You need did you do Somber Smithing Stone sevens?
[168:05.40]I don't know what I need.
[168:11.46]What is that?
[168:14.20]What is... This is the wrong door.
[168:17.26]Oh, it's another dragon.
[168:18.24]This dragon so badly wants to get over.
[168:19.96]No, no, it's this one.
[168:20.82]Because then we go up and we wrap around.
[168:25.75]Yeah, this is it.
[168:28.41]I think.
[168:31.27]No, yeah, this is definitely it.
[168:34.37]Okay.
[168:36.63]Smash!
[168:38.03]Smash!
[168:38.99]Watch out!
[168:41.52]Ba-boom!
[168:44.06]Watch out, we got a bleeder.
[168:45.18]You know what one of my favorite sound effects is in all video games?
[168:49.26]I don't.
[168:50.60]It was when ever you got a double dunk from that like... It was like a crit sound.
[168:59.20]It was like... It was the best sound effect in gaming.
[169:12.73]And if you got more than one, if you did twice in a row, you'd be like... Something weird about seeing my wife type in all caps BASED.
[169:22.87]Like these streams have been having an effect on her.
[169:25.05]Because she wouldn't have said that like a week ago.
[169:33.60]BASED.
[169:39.56]Uh-oh.
[169:41.66]What's wrong?
[169:42.88]No, she just says, uh-oh with a crying face.
[169:44.92]Now, I don't know.
[169:47.82]She's in trouble.
[169:49.98]And then she says, make it rain.
[169:52.02]Make it rain.
[169:53.98]It's just to get out of any conversation.
[169:55.65]Make it rain.
[169:56.89]Make it rain.
[170:01.85]I thought you dyed your hair.
[170:03.79]What?
[170:05.27]Don't kill him.
[170:06.05]He's a musician.
[170:07.89]Alright.
[170:08.29]Alright.
[170:08.73]I won't.
[170:09.17]I bounced.
[170:12.01]He's a musician.
[170:13.05]Alright, play us a song then.
[170:18.71]Play us a song.
[170:23.80]Play us a song.
[170:28.00]Oh, that's a hit.
[170:30.68]What?
[170:33.90]Hold on, let me get the double donk.
[170:54.02]Hey, uh play uh play us up play us out Roxanne, you know can you do that one?
[171:04.56]Oh That was pretty good No, please
[171:25.06]What's the highest minus a chatter can give you?
[171:27.37]Like, if they do a +2 or -2, when have you done something so awful that they're allowed to be, like, minus ten?
[171:33.61]It doesn't count.
[171:36.89]It's either good or bad.
[171:39.76]It's not, like, super good or super bad.
[171:42.20]It's just, was that good or bad?
[171:45.28]That's it.
[171:48.98]Omega Dung Beetle!
[171:54.23]I don't want to kill this.
[171:56.43]Oh, but you'll kill the musician.
[171:59.21]The guy's just out there playing for tips.
[172:12.08]No, there's no plus one or minus one.
[172:15.58]It's always two.
[172:16.60]Why is it always two?
[172:17.57]I don't know, because it's supposed to be the amount of minutes to add or subtract.
[172:20.95]Do you even know the lore?
[172:22.80]I don't.
[172:23.48]That's why I'm asking.
[172:25.08]Etalyx and I, we played Kane and Lynch.
[172:29.13]This is the bridge, by the way.
[172:30.35]Oh, let's do it.
[172:31.75]I always honestly thought that +2, -2.
[172:34.41]Wait, where does this one, this bridge, this... let's go.
[172:37.60]I always thought +2 -2 was a a Sims reference because when you like your sim has an interaction that they do or don't like that you can get like the -2 like I don't- I don't like what he's saying.
[172:48.00]No, it was- Etalyx and I did a stream one time where we were like let's try to beat Cain and Lynch in one sitting.
[172:55.00]The game is like three and a half hours or four and a half hours long. It's a very short game, becau- it's the second one Cain and Lynch 2.
[173:02.00]And we set up this thing where wait a minute what if we gave it a time limit for us.
[173:06.82]Where we had to beat the game in two hours or something or three hours but every time we made a good joke chat could add two minutes to the timer or they could subtract two minutes from the timer, right?
[173:18.82]Okay.
[173:20.82]So, depending on how funny we were we got to have more time to beat the game and it actually turned out to be- we-
[173:27.00]We ended up at the last cut scene of the game I think with less than two or three minutes left.
[173:34.00]That's a +2.
[173:37.37]I liked it better when I thought it was The Sims.
[173:42.08]You can keep pretending as that.
[173:47.10]Yeah, and we eventually, once we had less than 20 minutes left, we started getting kind of desperate.
[173:51.50]And the jokes were awful.
[173:52.99]And we were losing time.
[173:54.07]Is there a hidden room here?
[173:57.61]Yeah, there is.
[173:58.55]I did see it.
[173:59.91]It was down at the bottom.
[174:02.57]I don't think I've ever been in that hidden room.
[174:04.49]I'd like to make it a point that when we come back, we go to that hidden room.
[174:11.75]This might break both of our games.
[174:14.90]I don't think so.
[174:16.70]This is just the Four Lords fight from Dark Souls 1.
[174:22.69]Is it a dog?
[174:23.49]Is it a single dog?
[174:26.61]guy it's a dead guy why was it I don't know I just been waiting for someone to fight me so long I died el misbegotten crusader and I got horror lose Earth shatter Earth shaker man what weapon is he holding oh they're usually two
[174:46.55]Yeah.
[174:47.19]There's the dead guy and this guy.
[174:48.41]That weapon is so cool looking.
[174:50.72]That weapon is aw- What weapon is that thing?
[174:53.08]Oh, that's like the Elden Beast Remembrance or something.
[174:55.40]Holy shit, that thing is so fucking cool.
[174:57.84]That's the coolest weapon in the game.
[174:59.30]I've never seen that.
[175:00.64]Isn't that the one that shoots like a gigantic super... What the fuck?
[175:07.14]I want this.
[175:08.86]Hope he drops it.
[175:16.78]It's the Golden Order Greatsword.
[175:19.59]That thing is so cool.
[175:28.59]Oh, time for Turma to change builds.
[175:32.30]No.
[175:34.46]That thing is awesome.
[175:37.64]Scales great with Faith.
[175:45.40]You have it in your inventory, bro.
[175:47.59]I don't have it.
[175:48.51]No, I don't.
[175:50.01]You have to look now.
[175:52.59]I don't.
[175:54.13]I'm telling you, that sword is very distinct looking.
[175:56.65]I do not have it in my inventory.
[176:00.13]I have the glintstone Chris.
[176:03.99]Oh, you got Chris?
[176:05.77]No, I don't have this weapon.
[176:07.31]You guys are full of shit.
[176:12.10]No.
[176:22.80]I'm gonna level up.
[176:25.22]It's the Faith version of the Moonlit Greatsword.
[176:27.90]So, I'll give you a cool build.
[176:30.52]Moonlit Greatsword one hand, Golden Order Greatsword in the other hand.
[176:36.01]Sun.
[176:37.17]Moon.
[176:39.19]Oh, that's pretty cool.
[176:40.89]The sun and moon conjoined.
[176:43.73]BatChest me all you want.
[176:45.09]That's what I'm doing on my next playthrough.
[177:00.87]The eclipse build.
[177:04.12]Yeah, and I would wear really dark armor.
[177:06.24]So it's like the sun and the moon eclipsing into each other.
[177:09.63]Come on.
[177:27.10]Do you identify as the darkness or the light?
[177:30.48]Bro, you would need to be level 200 to even attempt that.
[177:33.60]Yeah, that's alright.
[177:43.49]Mohg's Great Rune.
[177:45.85]Cool.
[177:47.15]I also got Mohg's Great Rune.
[177:51.14]Weird.
[177:53.34]I think they're just here.
[177:54.76]Wait a minute.
[177:56.02]Because you also had the thing?
[177:59.31]No, I didn't.
[178:00.47]Dude, I think they're just up here.
[178:02.65]You can just pick them up.
[178:04.91]Wasn't that the great rune that you heal when you hit things?
[178:09.05]Yeah, but are you understanding that I think we could have just come to two of these towers and gotten these?
[178:14.04]I think you can just pick them up off the ground.
[178:17.04]I think the randomizer just puts them here.
[178:20.80]Because I didn't have that.
[178:22.80]I had the unborn one.
[178:26.14]Well, yeah, that's Millennials.
[178:27.16]What does Moogs do?
[178:29.52]Something about blood.
[178:30.89]Blessing of blood?
[178:31.59]Yeah, I don't know.
[178:33.07]Alright.
[178:33.81]Are you ready to go to Forbidden Lands?
[178:35.61]No.
[178:36.21]I wanted to go down that elevator.
[178:39.93]So, yeah.
[178:40.75]Forbidden Lands.
[178:42.69]And then I want to go in the elevator and do the secret room.
[178:52.46]I'll do the flask in a second.
[179:12.35]I'm going to mark these because I know we'll forget.
[179:25.37]Okay.
[179:25.47]You want me to tell a joke?
[179:32.56]No.
[179:49.98]I think I saw it on the right when we were going up.
[179:53.13]I think because we missed those right there.
[179:55.64]They're in front of us straight forward.
[179:57.06]You see it, you look up.
[179:59.48]Yeah, OK, we're going in there.
[180:12.19]Yeah.
[180:13.83]I forget what's in here.
[180:16.09]I've never been in here.
[180:16.91]Five dragon hearts.
[180:18.72]How many of these do I have?
[180:21.70]Yo bro yo.
[180:25.77]I have 11 dragon hearts.
[180:27.83]I could probably just go buy up the whole store.
[180:33.31]Let's go to... You know there's the dragon heart place on the first island near the starter area?
[180:39.49]Yeah.
[180:40.41]Let's go there.
[180:41.47]Okay.
[180:44.25]It's right over here.
[180:47.87]It's like down on the beach.
[180:49.79]The entrance.
[180:50.65]I think we have to just go to the first step, right?
[180:54.88]Because it's right here.
[181:06.01]Do the one in Caelid.
[181:06.87]The bigger one is in Caelid.
[181:08.65]We've been there.
[181:09.55]Yeah, we've already been there.
[181:10.21]And it's sold a lot of good things.
[181:11.77]So I'm assuming this one will also sell good things.
[181:14.47]Yeah, this one will be different too, right?
[181:16.33]Yeah.
[181:18.16]It's doing that thing.
[181:22.01]really is doing that thing we haven't had like crashes today or a lot of disconnecting it's been better just the voting to warp sometimes this is the best mod this really is it's just so good I just can't I can't believe I can't believe it's just you know what I mean I can't believe I know what you mean are you drinking pickle juice no oh we never killed the slob right in the beginning
[181:50.67]When are you going to do a face reveal?
[181:52.12]What if I just went like... There was a clay coming off.
[181:56.18]And like I pulled my nose down.
[181:57.86]Clay.
[181:58.86]Clay.
[182:00.00]And it was a different face under here.
[182:03.74]It's the same face.
[182:05.91]Just kind of very slightly different.
[182:15.65]Ow!
[182:17.08]My bones!
[182:17.96]Oh, this is the rot one.
[182:26.51]I can't lock on again.
[182:45.66]Alright, would you laugh if one of the best items in the whole game dropped right here and you could have had it at the very beginning?
[182:52.54]I would laugh.
[182:53.22]I would laugh.
[182:54.60]Crystal Tear.
[182:55.18]I don't even... Strength, not Crystal Tear.
[183:03.68]What are my opinions on Pilk?
[183:07.08]Jesus.
[183:08.20]I read that too fast.
[183:11.36]Other way.
[183:12.62]Friend.
[183:13.00]Other way, friend.
[183:16.45]traveling to the beach this is our beach episode the beach the beach episode oh there's uh one of the invisible squigglies
[183:47.54]Can you still do your magma jump?
[183:49.44]I cannot, but... Sorry.
[183:52.95]I mean, you should still have that in your inventory.
[183:55.65]I don't have any faith to use it, though.
[183:58.79]Most of these are very simple.
[184:00.27]Just some of them are just annoying.
[184:03.15]I'll get it right here.
[184:03.69]That was so close.
[184:07.25]Like, that was literally a frame.
[184:08.65]Yeah, there we go.
[184:09.22]We're fine.
[184:13.11]Alright.
[184:14.25]So how do we get over there?
[184:15.67]We need to go there.
[184:19.58]It's like a weird teleport or something, isn't it?
[184:23.00]No.
[184:23.64]You can just walk.
[184:25.18]There's a cave that goes under.
[184:30.29]You got to go in the cave and battle the dwellers of the deep.
[184:36.25]Oh, the Bok cave.
[184:37.13]Yeah, that's true.
[184:39.73]Yeah, Amadeus is in there.
[184:41.39]Big hand boss is hanging out over.
[184:48.31]There's a merchant up here.
[184:49.57]I'm going to go see if he's got any cool items.
[184:51.65]I would, you know, it'd be more disappointing to see if this guy actually was selling like something ridiculous.
[184:58.17]Yeah.
[185:04.14]I mean, he does sell Smithing Stone 456 for me.
[185:13.87]I think I was going to buy like a million of these.
[185:15.57]Frozen needle.
[185:23.67]What is this thing?
[185:26.85]That's a fun weapon.
[185:28.35]I think it's a rapier that shoots an ice projectile.
[185:41.31]gonna buy it and I'm gonna buy 104 of these of what I have like little poison things now hold on okay that sounds really cool that sounds incredible they scale with strength I'm gonna kill him while you're talking don't this guy has awesome for me don't do it
[186:10.18]Oh, yeah, I can take the bell bearing.
[186:16.87]Why do you want to kill these guys?
[186:21.21]What's wrong with you?
[186:22.63]I just want to go in the cave.
[186:24.25]Convenience?
[186:25.45]It's holding you up.
[186:26.99]I need to put this on my bar because now I have like 200 fucking poison darts.
[186:30.10]I got 200 poison snowballs.
[186:42.01]Oh, watch out.
[186:42.43]It's pretty dark down here.
[186:51.72]Now all merchants are hostile.
[186:55.90]Okay.
[186:56.38]Oh, that's like... That's cute.
[186:58.82]They think they can take us.
[187:05.04]Alright, what do I got here?
[187:09.98]Boys.
[187:15.89]Charged attacks.
[187:22.59]What?
[187:23.45]This guy's on the ground dying and he's like, oh, they're going to kill me.
[187:26.35]I'm like, here, have a golden sewing needle.
[187:28.27]Does that make this better?
[187:31.57]I kind of don't want to take anything off.
[187:39.56]You good now?
[187:40.62]You'll stop complaining?
[187:43.60]I think I'm alright now.
[187:51.67]Don't I have the needle?
[187:53.49]I gave it to him.
[187:54.19]Oh, okay.
[187:57.65]Okay.
[188:03.76]I mean, it's kind of embarrassing.
[188:04.72]There's like a really low level zone for him to be dying in.
[188:08.92]Can I test these to see if this is worth spending like 20,000 souls?
[188:12.18]Don't kill the guy over there.
[188:14.19]What the hell?
[188:23.73]This is like a fucking mess.
[188:29.21]I don't know what just happened.
[188:34.22]Swift Glintstone shard.
[188:35.52]I know I don't do magic, but that's a pretty good one.
[188:39.06]What the fuck?
[188:43.50]Where are they?
[188:46.22]Oh, shit.
[188:46.48]Whoa.
[189:04.69]These guys are so parryable, by the way.
[189:07.15]Mr. Parry.
[189:09.21]Yeah.
[189:10.73]I don't have, like, my weapon doesn't really hurt them.
[189:15.72]Oh, I don't have a parry shield.
[189:22.56]The other one's just, like, spinning in the corner.
[189:28.21]She gave me Scarlet Rot.
[189:30.29]Yep.
[189:35.37]Please hold.
[189:49.78]Break!
[189:51.54]Do the noise?
[189:53.14]Oh, you mean the... Yeah, I don't know how I hurt them.
[190:02.75]It's pretty much you have to parry them or use blunt.
[190:10.20]That's what I mean.
[190:10.80]I don't put on a parry shield, but now this one is unparryable.
[190:15.48]It's kind of like this is where your character arc starts to shine.
[190:18.80]I'm doing pretty well.
[190:26.23]I think you can hurt them now.
[190:30.99]I think once like they get like broken up or something.
[190:33.33]Yeah.
[190:40.51]Ooh, commoner's headband.
[190:42.95]Somber ancient dragon Smithing Stone.
[190:45.07]Oh, I got an ant skull shield.
[190:49.26]That's kind of weird.
[190:53.92]Ant skull plate.
[190:58.65]Look at this thing.
[191:00.05]No.
[191:03.31]Look at this thing.
[191:03.85]Look at how weird this is.
[191:04.43]No.
[191:05.43]No.
[191:06.89]Look at how weird this is.
[191:07.59]Come here.
[191:08.65]Where?
[191:09.32]I'm trying to go to the dragon temple.
[191:17.86]I won't look at it.
[191:19.22]I won't look.
[191:24.27]Don't exit.
[191:24.83]Don't exit.
[191:25.49]Don't exit.
[191:25.91]Don't exit.
[191:26.37]Don't exit.
[191:28.46]They put that there to trick you.
[191:29.52]I feel like I haven't blinked in a while.
[191:38.25]Uh, give it a try.
[191:38.93]Okay.
[191:43.61]Great stars.
[191:44.86]Ooh.
[191:45.50]What the fuck?
[191:54.91]Don't kill it.
[191:55.53]Dude, come on.
[191:58.37]I don't think we could have walked by.
[191:59.71]I think he could jump over his legs.
[192:18.12]Isn't there an invasion here too?
[192:20.66]Yeah, maybe.
[192:28.69]I didn't... Oh, no.
[192:36.75]That's like my favorite animal in Elden Ring.
[192:40.62]Why did I do that?
[192:43.78]Yeah, these kind of suck.
[192:45.98]But... Elden Star is...
[192:51.86]Great heal.
[192:52.52]I mean, I feel like I should just get it.
[192:57.66]Like, 11 of these.
[192:59.18]Buy everything.
[193:02.32]You can sell Jerma anything.
[193:04.18]Just put it in front of him.
[193:06.79]I mean, this is the only place you can spend this currency.
[193:10.19]I have 11 of them, and I can't spend it anywhere else, so I might as well just get it.
[193:17.51]You make a good point.
[193:19.39]I forgot that they're, like, selling these based on, like, made-up currency.
[193:22.31]It is just a made-up currency.
[193:23.97]It's not runes.
[193:24.85]It's just dragon hearts, which I have a ton of.
[193:27.71]And there's only six items in the game.
[193:29.45]I have 11 hearts.
[193:31.66]I have at least four or five surplus of hearts.
[193:36.72]I have one.
[193:41.30]Okay, so we're going to the... We're going to the... Maybe lands...
[194:10.25]This area is too blue.
[194:11.55]I wish they would redo it.
[194:16.02]Hey, how do you go down to, uh, you know where all, like, the Scarlet Rot Swamp is?
[194:22.15]Yes.
[194:23.33]Where's that entrance?
[194:24.71]It's underground.
[194:25.75]It's part of the quest line for Ranni.
[194:29.65]And from my understanding, you need to go there from Nokron.
[194:33.61]Shit.
[194:33.87]Hmm.
[194:43.53]Almost just walked off the edge looking at chat.
[194:45.25]My fault.
[194:46.82]I don't know why I'm following you.
[194:49.06]I know where I'm going.
[194:56.00]Where are you going?
[194:58.08]I know where I'm going.
[194:59.62]We should get that.
[195:00.04]We gotta get the map.
[195:08.05]I know where I'm going.
[195:13.58]That old man had it coming.
[195:21.51]Jesus.
[195:21.91]Did that make like a jump scare noise for you?
[195:26.25]No, it was just kind of right in my face.
[195:29.96]Like when he attacked, it was like... I think that's like the you are going to get knocked off your horse sound.
[195:36.78]The...
[195:42.49]Purse mark of death.
[195:44.15]Oh, I think that's the thing to do the boss with Fia.
[195:47.67]Isn't it?
[195:48.91]I think I have that.
[195:50.05]My chat was telling me we could do that earlier and then I said.
[195:53.61]Cool.
[195:54.99]I waited some else.
[196:02.07]Don't even do this to me.
[196:09.84]Oh, that's right.
[196:10.24]These things, these dung beetles don't give anything.
[196:21.50]uh boss man yeah yeah there's usually a um one of those um I got the glaive they spin it around they look like a gargoyle
[196:47.51]Now what a fool I am.
[196:49.47]I hit him in his elbow, but he has elbow guards on.
[196:52.01]That was actually really dumb.
[196:57.79]Oops.
[197:05.01]You want to end it?
[197:09.15]Go for it.
[197:12.89]God, I'm so freaking cool.
[197:18.57]Oh my god, 72,000.
[197:19.19]Very good.
[197:25.56]Map, very good.
[197:26.00]Fragment is right here.
[197:30.42]Up over this.
[197:34.72]Let us gamble.
[197:35.49]There's no time to gamble when we just destroy it really quickly.
[197:47.76]Let's take a little nap.
[197:59.73]I need to level up.
[198:05.87]Is 45 enough or should I do 50?
[198:07.15]50?
[198:07.19]45 is not enough?
[198:19.95]Do what they say.
[198:22.63]Isn't there a... What's the cap for vigor?
[198:27.31]Is it 60?
[198:27.91]Oh, that's right.
[198:28.80]I keep forgetting.
[198:29.30]I keep thinking it's 40.
[198:31.38]Do what they say.
[198:32.30]I did.
[198:40.13]Come on.
[198:40.79]60 is the true cap.
[198:50.74]Who do you think is going to be in the Giants area?
[199:00.93]How could I possibly know the answer to that question?
[199:03.45]I think it's going to be an Ulcerated Tree Spirit.
[199:06.19]You say that for every single one.
[199:08.02]And one of these times, it's going to be right.
[199:10.52]Oh, he knew, he knew.
[199:11.82]It's Radon.
[199:13.06]I'm going to say Radon every time because we still haven't seen him.
[199:28.89]That's right, it could be Radon.
[199:29.89]If it is Radon, that's actually not good.
[199:31.27]It's gonna be a super scaled Radon.
[199:34.55]This guy's covering his face because of how ugly he is.
[199:37.29]Oh, he ruined it.
[199:43.92]Finally, we meet the tarnished.
[199:48.50]Oh, yeah, our clothing is different.
[199:50.46]His head's like a mushroom fungus for me.
[199:52.90]His head is still covered in mine, too.
[199:56.31]That is most as for his flesh.
[199:58.05]I hope you can
[199:59.71]Oh wait, he goes, let chaos take the world!
[200:01.76]This guy's messed up.
[200:03.10]I say we take him out.
[200:05.02]Hold on.
[200:05.28]Hold on.
[200:24.19]Chaos take the world.
[200:27.67]May chaos take the world.
[200:33.04]There it is.
[200:33.60]He said it.
[200:33.98]Okay.
[200:39.22]Is there maybe a boss down here?
[201:07.79]Where is it?
[201:08.23]I don't know.
[201:13.95]Oh, Smithing Stone seven.
[201:15.53]Yes.
[201:16.01]That means you can upgrade one of these.
[201:17.58]Here's the hole.
[201:28.66]Open it, peasant.
[201:33.71]what's in here come on what is it Smithing Stone seven Somber Smithing Stone nine I need that you want it I need that yeah I can even Smithing Stone nine is on the ground
[202:02.50]That's fantastic news.
[202:06.03]I don't know what killed him, but he died.
[202:10.55]Killed chaos guy.
[202:17.53]Oh, you picked on the two Elden Lord wannabes.
[202:20.96]You picked on the wrong.
[202:21.92]Let's just leave.
[202:32.01]He's going to hit me.
[202:33.27]I'll be back when I become Hokage.
[202:34.79]You need to kill the... Get out of the way!
[202:43.06]Okay.
[202:52.90]Alright, there's a dungeon down there, but there's also...
[203:02.14]Do we have to do that awful, awful village?
[203:07.30]Where you run away from people with a... It's hopefully it's random enemies.
[203:11.68]But that's how you... Isn't that how you get to the Haligtree?
[203:15.09]Yeah.
[203:16.65]We ain't doing that.
[203:18.29]Well, no, if it's random enemies, they're not... Wait, if they're invisible still.
[203:21.67]It might... Yeah.
[203:22.85]If it's randomly invisible enemies, that could be even worse.
[203:26.35]I don't know if it could be any worse than something like insta backstabbing you.
[203:29.51]Yeah, that's true.
[203:32.31]That's true.
[203:37.34]They're not invisible.
[203:41.04]The like machine gun archers that are all on the roof.
[203:43.92]Why would I get Botox?
[203:45.58]Why would I get Botox for any reason?
[203:52.66]I don't know.
[203:55.03]It's called when you get out of the shower, moisturize your goddamn face.
[204:00.21]Do you moisturize when you get out?
[204:01.43]Do you moisturize your face?
[204:03.57]Immediately.
[204:04.45]Right.
[204:04.63]Do you actually?
[204:05.79]I'm an avid moisturizer these days.
[204:09.31]Thank you very much.
[204:12.56]It's dry as heck out here.
[204:14.10]Oh, and you're in Vegas, which I think you've been lying about, to be honest.
[204:18.84]I just don't live here.
[204:19.92]Yeah, I was just thinking yesterday about how... I live in Kansas.
[204:26.07]I was like, oh, yeah, like E3.
[204:26.95]No, not E3.
[204:29.29]Evo was coming.
[204:29.87]I was like, yeah, I want to go out to Vegas.
[204:31.05]And then, like, wait.
[204:31.89]I'm going to, like, realize Jerma doesn't actually live out there.
[204:34.05]And he's been lying.
[204:34.73]He's, like, in Europe.
[204:36.90]That seems like something you would do.
[204:44.18]Awfully quiet.
[204:44.88]Couple items.
[204:48.10]Dude, I keep getting Spitting Stone 7s.
[204:49.53]The game knows what I want.
[204:52.42]Well, if I was in EU, I think that all the EU viewers right now are like, nah, nah, that's fucking not happening.
[204:59.50]Because it's like 4 a.m.
[205:01.55]every time I turn the stream on.
[205:03.13]That would be really strange.
[205:04.23]Smithing Stone 7 again.
[205:08.09]Smithing Stone 7 again.
[205:09.27]Dude.
[205:12.77]What's the odds of that actually happening, though?
[205:15.54]What's the odds of that actually happening?
[205:17.08]That's pretty low.
[205:19.10]Watch out, we got a bung boy.
[205:21.41]No, skunk beetle.
[205:27.50]Founding rain of stars, mate.
[205:28.58]Do you want to try it?
[205:32.42]I have it already.
[205:33.82]Founding rain of stars.
[205:36.40]Yo, I also got it from that.
[205:37.66]What are the odds of that?
[205:41.23]Where'd you go?
[205:41.65]Yeah, yeah.
[205:47.89]We're going to have to do a crash session.
[205:53.48]We're going to have to do a crap session?
[205:55.44]A craft.
[205:56.70]I can, like, upgrade my moon veil.
[205:58.74]I think I can upgrade one of your swords.
[206:01.40]I thought you were like, hey, man, we got to really do, like, a crap session right now.
[206:04.14]Hey, we're going to have the craps table.
[206:05.69]I come down to Vegas.
[206:06.35]We're going to have the craps, man.
[206:07.63]I can talk to Millenia.
[206:10.25]You can talk to Millenia?
[206:11.85]Mm-hmm.
[206:13.91]She's rent-free in your head.
[206:15.67]I've said regardless.
[206:16.75]I won't allow not even you.
[206:18.91]Nope.
[206:24.56]um yeah you want to go to upgrade your weapon I just want to keep going
[206:33.55]Let's go through.
[206:34.03]Let's get past the giant.
[206:35.07]Because then once we beat giant and we burn the tree, we kind of can decide when we want to end our playthrough.
[206:43.94]You know what I mean?
[206:46.00]Because after the giant, it's like, alright, what else do you really want to do?
[206:48.58]Because we can then go right to the air tree.
[206:52.94]I think you just want to burn a bowl.
[207:01.43]Hey, left or right, man?
[207:05.34]Left.
[207:07.02]I want the map fragment.
[207:20.55]That would be so awful.
[207:23.55]It's too nice men on horseback coming our way.
[207:30.56]Imagine getting hit in both of your ears at the same time with two big-ass weapons.
[207:36.38]What is that?
[207:37.44]I can imagine.
[207:38.32]I've been clapped.
[207:39.14]Have you been clapped?
[207:40.27]Why is that on the ground?
[207:41.29]Oh, wait.
[207:41.63]This is where you fight one of the invaders.
[207:51.16]I can't get off the horse.
[207:58.85]Isn't this where you fight one of the, um, the manor people?
[208:05.00]You fight somebody from the manor here, don't you?
[208:06.80]I don't know.
[208:07.48]Well, I'm asking chat.
[208:10.96]Yeah, I have his, I have his letter.
[208:19.60]Am I the invader?
[208:20.68]Oh.
[208:23.77]Juno, watch out.
[208:25.67]Wait, what?
[208:27.21]Wait, hey!
[208:29.67]Not cool!
[208:30.39]Behind you!
[208:31.73]I wasn't ready!
[208:33.43]Why am I fat rolling?
[208:34.81]I've been working with him the whole time.
[208:37.09]Just to get you on stream, to get you here.
[208:39.49]So we can finally, once and for all, prove to Strippin that you're not a fucking gamer.
[208:43.65]Strippin!
[208:44.67]Let's go!
[208:45.07]Strippin, what are you doing?
[208:58.52]Get out of here!
[209:07.15]I don't even know what I'm swinging at.
[209:08.25]I feel like I'm... You still want to kill me.
[209:14.79]Well, fine.
[209:15.41]Fuck you.
[209:15.95]I'll bring my own friend.
[209:18.33]Oh, I can't.
[209:18.87]No!
[209:25.44]Oh, you just chug it!
[209:27.08]Fuck you!
[209:42.09]Hey, try to get a parry.
[209:43.89]Try to get a parry.
[209:44.79]I tried.
[209:45.31]Ready?
[209:48.11]It teleported me out already.
[209:50.75]What did we even get from that?
[209:53.08]A funny moment where we could fight each other for a minute?
[209:55.34]Are we even in the same game anymore?
[210:02.72]I don't know.
[210:04.42]I think that actually did break the co-op.
[210:06.98]Because you were an invader.
[210:08.34]Wait, no.
[210:09.95]Yeah.
[210:13.25]It was a funny stream moment.
[210:18.25]And nobody won.
[210:19.33]Actually, I think I can level up.
[210:25.48]Wait, isn't there a... Okay, while you rejoin, I have a quick PP time.
[210:29.98]Okay.
[210:38.40]Okay, I think I'm stuck in, like, limbo here.
[210:40.89]I have to restart.
[210:42.11]Alright, yeah, we'll just do another P-Break.
[210:44.51]We'll be right back.
[210:45.97]I'm gonna restart.
[210:50.57]Uh-oh.
[210:58.10]Not really sure what to do about this.
[210:59.88]I. I think I'm still in his game.
[211:07.16]Ready to die.
[211:28.43]There we go.
[211:29.15]Wait, but am I still in his game?
[211:33.39]No, I can't even touch the bonfires.
[211:37.44]I have to alt F4.
[211:38.96]Wait.
[211:39.98]Why?
[211:40.22]What happened?
[211:42.28]I'm going to lose 50,000 souls, but eh.
[211:47.07]I can't even quit the game.
[211:47.87]I have to alt F4.
[211:49.82]separation missed I don't think I can I just tried to banish you if you were oh there we go okay I think I'm good no yeah I gotta wait hold on I've opened my world I think I closed it by accident I think that's gonna work now yes okay alright did you pee

[212:45.66]Isn't there a bonfire like right here?
[212:48.47]Yeah, let's just get on our horses.
[212:51.25]Ride along the countryside.
[212:52.47]Don't get me wrong.
[212:57.43]I've never been to Scotland.
[212:59.70]Sounds.
[213:01.02]It sounds beautiful.
[213:01.98]Sounds like an incredible place.
[213:04.32]But it's me.
[213:05.58]That's the problem.
[213:09.07]I just I don't know.
[213:13.54]I feel like a bot.
[213:15.72]No, there's no bot.
[213:16.48]It's just like, I don't know.
[213:17.20]I don't really know Scotland.
[213:18.70]It feels like you're really trying to justify not buying a castle in Scotland.
[213:23.41]But like, I mean, like, I don't know.
[213:26.41]Yeah, I got to be so nice about it.
[213:28.27]Like, no, I don't want to live in a castle in Scotland.
[213:30.37]Okay, there you go.
[213:32.07]That's the whole statement.
[213:33.09]I don't need any more statements.
[213:34.31]I thought that said Ster.
[213:35.25]Where did you go?
[213:35.73]I was freaking out.
[213:43.38]Oh, so we gotta kill... Wait, what is... I don't... This jellyfish is underage?
[213:49.26]What?
[213:49.44]What are you looking at?
[213:53.04]There's a jellyfish here and it's like talking.
[213:59.23]You don't see it?
[214:00.07]No.
[214:03.75]No, but your chat's question marking.
[214:05.67]The jellyfish was like... You said when we were 14 we'd go visit the stars.
[214:09.90]There's an underage jellyfish here.
[214:11.76]Not making shit up.
[214:14.24]Don't you have to... Wait.
[214:15.84]Okay.
[214:16.48]You have to give the... Are you killing?
[214:21.64]It's gone.
[214:23.52]I'm just saying.
[214:24.72]You killed the jellyfish.
[214:26.99]And I think that that's worse than if you killed the turtle.
[214:32.05]I think your chat probably is freaking out right now.
[214:34.27]You can't prove that I killed it because you couldn't even see it.
[214:40.69]Pork brain.
[214:43.44]Yeah, that's raw pork brain, I think.
[214:47.10]Alright, let's keep going.
[214:48.28]Let's get out of here.
[214:49.80]I am patient, Zero.
[214:52.44]You're going to hear about me on the news.
[214:58.24]Yeah, this is going to be like a huge Reddit spread.
[215:01.79]Like, wait, why would he have done that?
[215:04.71]He ate pork that was in a backpack for a day?
[215:09.97]Turns out that's where COVID came from.
[215:11.91]Was it a bet?
[215:12.91]Why did he do that?
[215:13.85]That seems insane to me.
[215:18.64]Smithing Stone 7 again.
[215:21.64]Not me.
[215:24.20]And then they'll be like buried down in the thread.
[215:26.34]There'll be somebody like, I don't understand what the big deal is.
[215:28.78]I've eaten that before and I felt fucking fine.
[215:32.37]It's got like minus 200 fucking downvotes.
[215:37.18]I love scrolling to the bottom and showing like seeing the like controversial takes I love it who oh this oh okay you just hoed him he just looked a little lost
[216:21.55]Hey, Ster, do you want to know about playthrough lore for me?
[216:24.63]Your playthrough lore?
[216:25.37]Yeah.
[216:25.75]I first tried this boss when I was probably 20 or 30 levels too early finding it.
[216:31.79]I never found this boss.
[216:32.85]Praise me.
[216:33.39]Praise me.
[216:34.76]There's, like, you fight one of these in a basement somewhere.
[216:36.86]Yeah.
[216:37.66]I kept seeing people on streams fight it, and I was like, where the fuck is this?
[216:40.82]I still don't know.
[216:48.22]This is like an ice dragon out here, right?
[216:56.41]Okay, for a second, I thought all of his clothes just came off.
[217:01.23]They kind of did.
[217:01.89]That was...
[217:05.51]What?
[217:06.53]I thought I got away.
[217:09.29]You thought wrong.
[217:18.08]I... I was just mashing L1.
[217:22.12]I just didn't want to even fight this thing.
[217:26.84]So you're like bored of Elden Ring.
[217:30.39]You want to stop.
[217:32.07]We're not playing tomorrow.
[217:34.89]Can we just please go straight to Elden Beasts?
[217:36.75]Can we just end this already?
[217:43.56]No, that's not what I said.
[217:44.46]I don't even want to fight this.
[217:55.36]I'm just going to let him kill me because I don't even want to fight this.
[217:59.27]I'm just so over this.
[218:07.91]why are you lying me
[218:54.59]dude you got the mod that every time you get hit it does that to like fuck with you he's gonna kill me you're good would you smoke a blunt with the Godskin Apostle no no no way this is the type you smoke a blunt with with this motherfucker and they start like talking about wacky shit
[219:24.09]Like, hey, do you think that we should like ever, you know, like, I think we're going to live on the moon.
[219:29.44]It's like, I don't think, I don't know about that.
[219:34.12]Yeah, when they sign people up to go live on the moon, I'll be the first one.
[219:39.04]I love that you're quoting a real conversation that we had with someone.
[219:42.27]We did?
[219:44.61]don't remember we had like a taxi driver and we were leaving Seattle from like uh packs west this is a real thing this is a real bit dude hey I got an ancient ancient dragon Smithing Stone by the way you were looking for one of those this guy was talking about sending all of the prisoners from Earth to the moon to colonize it just like Australia we were in a 30 minute conversation with this guy what I don't remember any of this
[220:17.87]No, we didn't smoke a blunt with our taxi driver.
[220:21.15]No, no, no, no.
[220:22.55]He was just years ago.
[220:24.61]I don't know.
[220:26.35]Where are you sure it was you?
[220:27.94]I don't know who else would be there with me.
[220:29.88]Can you set it a bonfire?
[220:37.70]Like enough time has gone by that you don't think that guy's crazy anymore.
[220:42.03]You came up with that idea.
[220:43.79]Wait, what?
[220:44.15]What's weird about that?
[220:45.33]I was describing it as if it was very weird because I didn't want to smoke a blunt with the Godskin Apostle because he was going to start talking about weird shit like that.
[220:55.44]I was describing how it was weird.
[220:58.16]Okay.
[221:00.36]Where's the bonfire?
[221:01.88]I don't know.
[221:05.38]It was the Godskin Apostle.
[221:08.62]I don't know where I am.
[221:09.50]Yeah, and it's like somebody cut us off.
[221:12.86]And he did like, they got in front of us and they were like four cars in front of us.
[221:15.80]And he did like the fucking weird Gumby snake move.
[221:18.08]Went out of his window and went in front of the guy's car and gave the double middle finger to him.
[221:22.59]Like in his windshield, like in front of him.
[221:25.17]He did do that.
[221:25.75]Then he went, he came back in the window and he was like, sorry about that.
[221:29.11]It's weird you don't remember any of this until now.
[221:32.13]Yeah, it's weird that I didn't remember that until right now.
[221:36.33]You just want to watch me run around on a horse?
[221:39.05]We should live on the moon.
[221:42.10]No, I'm serious.
[221:42.90]No, I'm serious.
[221:44.16]It's like... I need direction.
[221:51.60]Yeah, we should definitely go live on the moon.
[221:54.77]Yeah, dude.
[221:56.09]I'm serious about this.
[222:08.09]I can't look at my map.
[222:08.87]I have to wait till... Am I going to just show up where I died?
[222:12.61]I see one.
[222:19.09]You definitely want to go move to a castle on the moon with Ster and you guys would make it rain and you'd be able to Like a boss be able to do where is that we're going with this mm-hmm Every day in our content castle
[222:35.40]It's every day, bro.
[222:37.52]I wouldn't want to live in a content castle because you know what would happen?
[222:40.86]One of us would be loud and it would just bounce off of every wall in the castle and it would be un-fucking-bearable.
[222:48.10]You'd hear yourself for a week.
[222:49.84]Yep.
[222:50.38]It would just be like... It'd be like, I can't fucking stand it.
[222:54.38]All these, like, stone walls, whatever the hell it is.
[222:58.20]Okay, I need to... Where are you?
[223:01.20]At the bonfire.
[223:04.37]I went across the bridge to the bonfire.
[223:07.17]Where the fuck are you?
[223:09.24]Wanna walk there?
[223:10.36]I need my souls, though.
[223:12.96]It was like 140,000.
[223:13.74]There was a lot of souls.
[223:17.38]Oh, but you teleported anyway.
[223:20.22]Well, I think it's close.
[223:21.47]Whatever.
[223:23.67]Would you smoke a blunt with Peter Griffin?
[223:29.23]You asking?
[223:29.83]I mean, I'm just bringing it up.
[223:32.25]Somebody brought it up.
[223:33.62]Okay.
[223:34.59]Mm-mm.
[223:35.63]I mean, well, hold on.
[223:38.70]Is Peter Griffin in my house?
[223:42.22]Like, is it like, okay, we're, like, hanging out at my place?
[223:44.06]Because the answer is no.
[223:45.66]Because Peter would probably be like, oh, yeah, so I can, like, stay here now.
[223:52.74]I'll be here for, like, a few weeks.
[223:54.78]Like, no.
[223:55.12]Uh-oh.
[223:58.88]Where did you go?
[224:00.08]I'm trying to show you where your souls are.
[224:02.42]Stay here overnight.
[224:04.78]You gotta go.
[224:08.86]My souls are by that urn tree.
[224:12.26]Yes.
[224:12.98]Across the bridge.
[224:14.54]You have to go across the bridge.
[224:19.66]Are you checking out?
[224:21.26]No, I'm fine.
[224:22.86]Peter, you can stay on the futon tonight, but then you gotta get the fuck out of here.
[224:39.50]Why is the Godskin Apostle back?
[224:44.70]Is he?
[224:45.24]Yeah.
[224:45.64]I don't see him.
[224:49.98]You don't see the Apostle?
[224:52.30]No.
[224:55.26]I see you dealing damage to invisible nothing.
[224:58.42]This is weird.
[224:59.00]Alright, well, get your runes.
[225:05.16]And then we're gonna go...
[225:10.98]Alright, let's get out of here quick.
[225:13.02]I'm not saying I couldn't handle it.
[225:16.31]I just don't want to handle it.
[225:17.27]You don't want to handle Peter Griffin.
[225:23.06]Yeah, two weeks later, he's in his underwear with a 12-pack on your couch.
[225:27.44]That's what I mean.
[225:31.87]And then he would, like, request really specific snacks.
[225:35.56]Right?
[225:35.70]And he'd be like, God damn it, Peter Griffin Family Guy shit.
[225:38.64]He'd be like, hey, remember those Slim Jims that were spicy back in the 90s?
[225:42.76]Yeah, go find me some of those.
[225:44.48]And it's like, oh, he's making a reference to something old.
[225:47.18]Wow, that's something you would never do.
[226:00.13]Can you even go make me some clam chowder?
[226:02.13]I don't know.
[226:03.63]Peter.
[226:09.72]That takes all day.
[226:13.74]No, he's crashing at our castle in Scotland.
[226:23.48]OK, we need to go.
[226:24.08]I need to sit down to bonfire.
[226:25.60]I think we went back.
[226:27.36]I don't.
[226:27.82]I'm lost.
[226:29.46]This is definitely backwards.
[226:31.32]We were at a bonfire.
[226:32.78]We were alright.
[226:34.40]Let me let me go spend these please.
[226:40.36]Sit down, let me spend it.
[226:41.76]We did a full circle.
[226:43.72]Well, we were talking that it happened.
[226:45.12]Well, let's let's teleport to the ancient Snow Valley worm ruins.
[226:49.46]Or some will teleport somewhere where it's it's right here.
[226:54.89]teleporting the loading screen would take longer for us just to walk here I didn't know it was right here come on man wait hold on a second wait what hold on wait it's underneath us oh turns out it wasn't right here someone's got an egg face egg face the correct way to go is I forget the correct way to go there's a Mohg like
[227:20.32]Where's the big crucible thing?
[227:22.56]That's the direction we need to go.
[227:23.70]Over that way, I think.
[227:32.43]Wait, isn't there a teleporter here?
[227:35.23]There's a teleporter down somewhere, like right around here.
[227:38.49]Isn't there?
[227:40.25]I don't remember.
[227:42.13]It definitely is.
[227:45.48]Not here.
[227:45.90]Okay.
[227:49.33]We gotta go that way.
[227:50.99]That way.
[227:52.53]I found the big cup.
[227:56.94]Follow me.
[227:59.68]I am going to you.
[228:03.16]Yep, there's the big cup.
[228:04.02]Yes, commander.
[228:15.67]I'd rather smoke a blunt with Homer.
[228:17.32]No, I'd rather smoke a blunt with Marge.
[228:18.60]I think Marge would be way chiller.
[228:25.34]Why does this guy have half health?
[228:27.32]Where did this guy come from?
[228:29.22]What?
[228:30.54]Why is he following us?
[228:32.56]He's invisible to me.
[228:34.06]This is all you.
[228:35.65]Never mind.
[228:36.07]He got full health again.
[228:37.05]Alright, we gotta go.
[228:40.07]Can we make this jump?
[228:41.69]No way.
[228:43.34]All the way around.
[228:45.08]I'm going down.
[228:46.40]No, no, no, no, don't.
[228:47.74]I can't.
[228:48.40]I'm already committed.
[228:49.38]You've committed already?
[228:50.30]Are you serious, dude?
[228:51.44]There's no way back up.
[228:52.36]What do you mean there's no way back up?
[228:54.66]You can't fucking jump up a cliff.
[228:59.24]We need to go that way.
[229:01.76]Tell me where I need to go again.
[229:03.62]You're going to find my hands in your jaw.
[229:07.71]in like yeah what are you yeah like I'm gonna put my hand in your mouth is he going the wrong way he's not going the right way is he I don't know he's going right we just went in circles for like 20 minutes I just figured anywhere else yeah I'm gonna die trying to do what you just did there's a there's a thing up here you can teleport to me if you dare let me prove that I can do this
[229:40.90]Yeah, and then this is the giant frozen lake, and you go across, and then the dragon's like... Thanks to you, I lost like 4,000 viewers, by the way, because of shit like that.
[229:56.09]Because of me.
[229:58.95]Oh, well, guess what?
[229:59.54]They all came over here.
[230:05.36]You're doing like Peter Griffin impressions.
[230:07.42]Traitors?
[230:08.20]Because of you.
[230:15.81]Alright, thank God I can level up.
[230:23.64]Can somebody help me?
[230:26.12]Why did I lose access to leveling?
[230:32.98]I don't know.
[230:35.44]That doesn't sound right.
[230:38.82]Maybe stuff still messed up from when you were an invader.
[230:55.11]hi hey I think I think my game is a little messed up delete it
[231:06.99]I cannot level up.
[231:10.09]Just restart.
[231:10.61]I'm going to restart the game.
[231:12.17]I'm vanishing.
[231:13.69]Yeah.
[231:14.33]You know what?
[231:14.95]No, don't even.
[231:15.62]I'm just going to quit.
[231:16.48]I'm just going to exit.
[231:18.06]I can't even exit the game.
[231:19.26]It's been a problem ever since.
[231:20.16]Okay.
[231:20.90]Alright.
[231:21.58]Did you vanish?
[231:22.08]Yeah.
[231:23.72]Alright.
[231:25.32]For some reason, it doesn't let you exit the game if you're in co-op.
[231:28.77]It really doesn't like the fact that I was an invader.
[231:30.51]I think it broke it.
[231:38.99]There it is.
[231:39.59]Okay.
[231:40.09]Let me... Why am I just leveling up?
[231:46.69]Okay.
[231:46.93]Can you put the thing down again?
[231:54.36]Oh, right.
[231:56.96]Mm-hmm.
[232:13.02]Come on.
[232:13.96]Need to get to 58.
[232:14.30]Come on.
[232:26.17]Dude, you have Ster muted.
[232:27.31]I wouldn't be surprised.
[232:30.87]He's got to learn that he has to... His behavior has to improve.
[232:34.59]Wait in line.
[232:35.23]I am not... You're not muted.
[232:39.89]I'm just trying to level up in case it happens again.
[232:45.69]okay is your thing I'm using maybe it's messed up because it's not Monday and we were supposed to play on Monday that's right alright is your thing down yeah hello
[233:14.48]Let's see what the dragon is.
[233:16.18]I don't know if we can find it.
[233:19.90]Because normally this area would turn into a mist.
[233:22.50]I think we have to actually walk over here.
[233:36.61]Hit him.
[233:37.85]Hit him.
[233:38.29]Hit him again.
[233:38.95]Keep hitting him.
[233:39.53]Okay.
[233:44.38]It is the dragon.
[233:45.38]I think it's just the ice dragon.
[233:49.24]Wanna fight it?
[233:52.32]Guess we have to.
[233:56.23]Maybe it's a different dragon.
[234:00.95]I can't see anything.
[234:01.98]Is this the right one?
[234:04.16]Doula?
[234:05.22]No.
[234:26.06]Oh, Abdullah.
[234:27.70]Have mercy on the poor bastard.
[234:36.80]Kinda got stuff growing on him.
[234:51.68]Ow.
[235:01.45]What?
[235:01.83]Oh, he held down.
[235:02.61]Aww.
[235:09.91]Very cool.
[235:12.37]Damn, that's another 125K.
[235:14.88]What a thematically appropriate item for him to drop.
[235:25.73]We could definitely beat Millenia.
[235:29.03]maybe I actually have three times the HP I did when we were trying it I want my swords to be leveled up another once two or three times I want to get them to at least plus 20 before we do that okay so earlier when I said let's go do some like leveling up because we've got a whole bunch of smith's uh stones and you said no was that so that we wouldn't have to fight Malenia no I right after that I was like no you know what let's get out of here
[235:56.95]I have two ancient dragon spitting stones.
[235:59.13]Do you want me to just give them to you?
[236:05.49]Sure.
[236:09.83]I'll be your stone master.
[236:11.02]Remember to level up.
[236:11.82]We just got a lot of... Yes, and make sure you grab those two omega items on the ground.
[236:18.32]Yeah, I don't want them.
[236:23.08]Molina's picking them up.
[236:27.25]I'm afraid to sit down because I don't want them to disappear.
[236:33.22]Pick them up.
[236:33.70]You can put them back down.
[236:38.74]I thought you crashed.
[236:40.98]I thought it was going to make you move or something.
[236:44.05]I thought you crashed.
[236:45.51]Okay.
[236:47.97]I got him.
[236:56.05]Cool.
[236:56.43]There's a, there's a, what the heck?
[236:58.99]Oh, there's a jail right here.
[237:02.71]Let's do it.
[237:05.53]Might as well.
[237:12.02]In it?
[237:12.78]Where is it?
[237:13.16]In it?
[237:14.06]Up the hill a little bit.
[237:17.22]It's normally a, a pro tag is in here.
[237:23.76]In it?
[237:26.81]What the hell was that?
[237:30.25]Oh, my God.
[237:32.75]What?
[237:32.97]He just got collateral.
[237:42.18]Is your sniper still here?
[237:53.42]No, he's gone.
[238:00.98]cool that was that was surprising my cat loves watching you that's cute
[238:24.31]Alright, the chain.
[238:29.95]That guy was big and strong and his muscles were bulging out of his freaking skin.
[238:36.74]We're gonna go up this way.
[238:38.74]There is a bonfire up here.
[238:40.24]I thought there was a jail here.
[238:45.33]I don't see it.
[238:50.95]Are you looking?
[238:52.92]I looked.
[238:54.00]Do you have eyes?
[238:55.60]I mean, I skimmed it.
[238:57.00]I scanned it.
[239:16.41]Oh, that's right.
[239:16.81]There's this place here.
[239:24.17]Somebody said we technically did the final assassination mission.
[239:29.02]So we should be able to turn that in and just go right to Rykard.
[239:33.84]Uh, if you want to be technical about it.
[239:43.73]Nice.
[239:43.97]Spring Stone 8.
[239:46.77]Okay, I've been waiting for this the whole game.
[239:48.61]Because up here I can finally get Rivers of Blood and play my real build.
[239:55.25]Forgot about Reikardt?
[239:56.23]Yeah, we did too.
[240:01.54]Don't look down.
[240:02.62]Alright, if it's Redan, I owe you 20 bucks.
[240:10.46]If it's Ulcerated Tree Spirit, you owe me 50 bucks.
[240:13.94]Okay.
[240:16.33]I'm that confident.
[240:23.31]And if it's General Grievous.
[240:26.12]General Grievous.
[240:28.06]Yeah, if LB1's back there, then we both... See, I was trying to say Grievous, but General Grievous is a POE guy.
[240:39.20]Oh.
[240:41.68]So you covered for me.
[240:42.52]I just want to make it clear.
[240:46.71]Let me be clear.
[240:53.21]Alright, uh, this is not the way.
[240:57.73]No, it's not.
[240:58.19]I was just looking.
[240:58.93]I was just taking a peek.
[240:59.75]Go, go, go, go, go.
[241:23.66]Oh, tarnished one.
[241:25.66]Your peepee is too small to enter land there.
[241:30.10]You must grow two inches.
[241:32.44]I can see it.
[241:50.50]There's bonfire.
[241:56.36]I said, dude, the vibes are rotten right now.
[242:00.28]Are they?
[242:00.64]I don't think so.
[242:02.24]I don't think the vibes are rotten.
[242:13.95]It's not this way, but this way I see like a tree.
[242:26.59]Oh, actually, dude, it was a good thing I went to that tree.
[242:31.81]I actually got for real carrying greatsword this time, like for real.
[242:36.15]Not a joke.
[242:37.89]Actually carrying greatsword.
[242:39.79]You're fucking with me.
[242:42.11]What?
[242:42.61]You're fucking with me.
[242:44.21]No, I'm not.
[242:46.79]Yeah, you got it.
[242:48.40]Yeah.
[242:49.49]Dude, no, you're screwing with me right now.
[242:51.00]You're lying.
[242:51.64]There's no way you got carry and greatsword.
[242:54.02]That's something that you would lie about because that's so unbelievable.
[242:58.78]I don't know if I believe you.
[243:01.26]We're doing a bit.
[243:02.80]Yes.
[243:04.10]Oh.
[243:07.54]Wait.
[243:09.06]Lore.
[243:10.09]Lore.
[243:11.57]This guy's got Two Fingers.
[243:14.17]His hand.
[243:14.79]His hand's got Two Fingers, dude.
[243:21.94]Yeah, he does.
[243:23.70]Were the giants, like, cutting their fingers off or something?
[243:28.18]And he's got tree stuff growing out of his arm.
[243:30.91]He's a tree.
[243:31.69]Giants are trees.
[243:33.17]Their hands are their brains and stirs right all along.
[243:35.97]But why would they be cutting their fingers off?
[243:38.31]I wonder.
[243:45.14]They are missing a lot of arms.
[243:46.84]They're missing the Three Fingers, aren't they?
[243:49.82]Like, the bad ones, right?
[243:51.88]Yeah, they're missing the bad boys.
[243:54.82]Huh.
[243:56.20]That actually is interesting.
[244:02.01]Maybe they're trying to commune with the greater will?
[244:05.09]Yeah, maybe that's interesting.
[244:09.69]You just unlocked some new vibes for me here.
[244:12.08]Wow, I saved the vibe.
[244:13.50]Alright, you ready?
[244:16.70]Let's do it.
[244:17.88]Yes?
[244:19.02]Am I?
[244:20.42]Where's the chain?
[244:21.56]By let's do it, we need to go a completely different direction.
[244:24.71]But there's an item over here.
[244:26.87]No, there's not.
[244:28.13]Ooh, stinky item.
[244:29.17]No, it's right here.
[244:32.71]Vibes have been restored.
[244:33.65]Yeah, a little.
[244:37.39]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[244:37.89]It's a little spot right here.
[244:39.36]Okay, here we go.
[244:40.94]What is the boss?
[244:43.02]It's through here.
[244:45.20]What is it?
[244:46.38]We're done.
[244:48.74]Should we let them bet?
[244:52.74]Will we go in?
[244:54.30]Let them bet.
[244:56.68]Vote or die.
[245:04.16]It's going to be a boat guy.
[245:05.34]That would be funny.
[245:08.32]We haven't seen a lot of boat guys.
[245:10.90]No.
[245:13.74]Bosses cannot spawn again.
[245:15.81]So, Malenia is in that manor spot permanently.
[245:19.99]Same thing with Elden Beast.
[245:27.80]Alaketh, that's right.
[245:28.80]That could be bad.
[245:30.40]Got a big skull down here.
[245:36.18]Guy's looking kind of dead.
[245:42.41]All in.
[245:43.87]Don't.
[245:44.74]Oh, okay.
[245:45.16]Some people are going all in.
[245:47.22]This is 20 million channel points.
[245:49.50]They're saying we're going to do it.
[245:50.90]I'll hold up.
[245:51.54]I'm predicting.
[245:53.10]Are you voting?
[245:54.46]Yeah.
[245:56.52]You got like two seconds.
[245:59.97]I missed it.
[246:00.89]Fucking God.
[246:02.01]Okay.
[246:02.99]Here we go.
[246:03.75]What is it?
[246:04.07]What is that?
[246:10.28]It's Horilu.
[246:12.46]The fire version.
[246:15.84]It's phase two Horilu.
[246:18.28]It's the grab hat.
[246:20.04]He's going to grab you.
[246:24.72]Just run away from him for a second.
[246:32.11]He's trying to grab me.
[246:40.26]Oh, shit.
[246:46.71]Oh, shit.
[246:47.45]He got me.
[246:48.71]He just powerbombed me.
[246:51.47]Take aggro.
[246:53.73]He's trying to grab me.
[246:55.09]This is actually a pretty funny fight to be on a horse.
[246:57.85]I don't even know if he can grab you off your horse.
[247:00.59]I think he can.
[247:02.19]Let's horse this guy down.
[247:11.65]Star star He's gonna get you This is actually fucking scary I feel like playing like a horror game Why don't you just go in why did you do that?
[247:34.71]Because it was under the snow and I thought there was like a snow buffer
[247:45.00]Oh no, so many people are like, my points, they're going to do it.
[247:48.09]I think we are.
[247:53.69]I can't lock on to him anymore, so that's not helping.
[248:00.83]This fucking asshole is riding around these horses.
[248:02.90]This is so unfair.
[248:14.26]oh he couldn't grab me he showed up but he could not what the I can't lock on to him dude neither can I
[248:54.79]Oh shit, he's doing it.
[248:59.93]Under the ground.
[249:07.85]Oh, he's got me.
[249:15.46]He's he disappeared.
[249:17.98]He's teleported.
[249:21.24]He is having trouble.
[249:22.10]He's like a hologram.
[249:39.26]Uh-oh.
[249:40.18]We're gonna get really cocky here, I think, and it's gonna be a downfall.
[249:43.78]Holy shit!
[249:47.59]Wow, I didn't think that would hit me that high up.
[249:49.63]Who would program that hitbox?
[249:53.86]I'm not cocky.
[249:54.34]I just can't lock on to this shit.
[249:57.84]Oh, fuck.
[250:03.40]Alright, just hit him one time.
[250:04.38]One time.
[250:05.32]Hit him one time.
[250:06.72]Well, can you?
[250:10.21]Sorry, doubters.
[250:11.03]It's too bad I didn't get my vote in.
[250:15.29]Wait a minute.
[250:17.19]Wait a minute.
[250:17.89]Don't pay it out yet.
[250:19.15]Don't pay it out yet.
[250:20.65]They paid it out.
[250:23.06]I scammed everyone.
[250:23.90]Is this a mega scam?
[250:25.64]Uh-oh.
[250:35.07]I skipped.
[250:37.63]Look, I transformed into a wolf.
[250:40.44]That would be so lame.
[250:47.42]Look at how scary I am.
[250:49.38]Oh.
[250:52.52]Sorry.
[250:53.24]I voice acted this wolf.
[250:54.62]Oh, my God.
[250:54.96]That feels a lot of damage.
[250:58.32]I have no more healing.
[251:02.20]We got really cocky.
[251:06.98]Oh, shit.
[251:07.62]This is actually kind of bad.
[251:12.47]You have to win or you scammed everyone.
[251:16.01]You have to win.
[251:25.46]I've got some warming stones down.
[251:35.29]I can't throw more than that far?
[251:53.82]Why are you doing like a Homer Simpson yells?
[252:03.07]Sorry?
[252:03.47]Oh shit!
[252:03.97]Don't do it!
[252:26.72]Ster, it's going to be up to you.
[252:27.56]I'm going to be able to hit him one or two more times.
[252:29.16]You're going to have to... For the guild.
[252:32.16]Or something.
[252:46.80]For the guild!
[252:48.10]For the guild!
[252:49.32]Scam did not happen.
[252:51.88]Scam averted.
[252:52.92]Got another inverted sword key for the teleporter.
[252:57.09]Oh, nice.
[252:58.35]And some battle bearings.
[252:59.81]Alright.
[253:01.17]Let's go smoke a bowl.
[253:03.85]Let's go.
[253:04.29]I can't.
[253:04.81]I can't get on my horse.
[253:07.19]I can't either.
[253:07.73]There's a bonfire up here.
[253:17.86]That could have gone really, really wrong if that was not that dog.
[253:21.66]I think you get you get like canceled.
[253:25.12]I think... If we didn't kill that.
[253:28.06]Scamming everybody out of channel points?
[253:31.47]I don't think you recover from that.
[253:32.67]Alright.
[253:49.50]So we're going to burn the tree.
[253:51.70]I'm going to go take a pee break because I didn't go when you did.
[253:55.12]I'm going to refill my little drink here.
[253:58.00]And I'm going to do like a grab a snack.
[254:00.36]Okay.
[254:01.20]As well.
[254:01.94]And then we can assess what we want to do.
[254:04.78]Because we've got our Missoula.
[254:12.77]Did you walk into the bowl when you played?
[254:14.75]You just walk into the center?
[254:16.81]I don't remember.
[254:17.31]No, I don't think so.
[254:18.89]I did.
[254:23.20]Because it doesn't even look that far down.
[254:25.76]And there's like a thing in the middle.
[254:27.80]I fell.
[254:28.80]I just walked straight in.
[254:31.30]Maybe I did.
[254:33.70]You did.
[254:33.98]I think I remember you saying to me that you also did it back then.
[254:37.20]I probably did.
[254:37.68]Alright.
[254:39.31]So you should probably just do this because I'm imagining your host.
[254:42.79]You should just do it.
[254:44.03]Yeah.
[254:45.03]I mean, like, I am the chosen one.
[254:47.05]So I don't mean to, like, be that guy.
[254:49.85]But what do I do?
[254:53.44]You say, yes, I'd like to burn the tree.
[254:57.13]She won't talk to me.
[255:00.03]I think because you sat down first.
[255:01.91]You like took her.
[255:03.55]She won't talk to me either.
[255:06.57]I think there is an item we need.
[255:08.11]I was saying earlier, I think there's like a burn the bush kind of like joint.
[255:13.31]Do we have to do something?
[255:15.13]I think we have to do it solo.
[255:19.15]Okay, yeah.
[255:19.89]Just kick me out.
[255:21.26]Kick me out.
[255:21.98]Go do some... Actually, wait.
[255:24.72]Before you kick me out, I'm going to give you a couple things.
[255:28.24]And I would appreciate it in this time when we're going to the bathroom, coming back.
[255:32.69]I'd appreciate if you take all these stones, please.
[255:37.97]Shove them up my ass?
[255:39.09]Like a baseball?
[255:40.87]I would say you probably shouldn't do that, but... I don't know how many you'd need.
[255:46.22]So, how many plus sevens do you need?
[255:48.38]Three?
[255:49.20]Just give them all to me, man.
[255:52.38]I don't know.
[255:53.16]And then I have a couple of plus eights.
[255:54.48]There you go.
[255:59.00]So then I would appreciate it if you were to take these and go upgrade the absolute hell out of them.
[256:08.72]I would really appreciate it.
[256:14.14]That's a lot of that's a lot of stones.

[271:29.67]I forgot to upgrade my moon veil.
[271:31.13]Fuck.
[271:32.21]See?
[271:33.51]It's already an issue.
[271:36.85]Well, I was upgrading your things and I got distracted.
[271:41.76]I'm probably not even going to use it.
[271:44.46]Okay, let's go upgrade Moon Veil real quick.
[271:54.65]It's going to do the thing again where it's not going to lose.
[271:58.45]They're so over leveled, but everything scales.
[272:02.37]If we lose to her, then we have to do a full playthrough in Genshin Impact.
[272:09.68]No.
[272:10.54]No, dude.
[272:11.48]I'm not... I don't want to agree to that.
[272:14.79]That's just like... I have nothing against that game.
[272:17.67]If we lose to her, then we have to get to Masters and League of Legends.
[272:21.07]That's going to take years.
[272:22.44]That's going to take months.
[272:34.26]sorry I just love this joke I don't want to play either of them I don't I don't either like I I've not again impact is I'm it's probably pretty fun I don't know I don't want to play it for like the next six months we both have to eat an Arby's uh euro if we lose oh my uh my moonbell's plus 10. let's go back what the are you doing
[273:04.49]Wait, this is heavy.
[273:05.23]That's weird.
[273:06.13]I don't know who upgraded that.
[273:07.45]I didn't because I wouldn't want to upgrade a Moon Veil.
[273:09.87]What?
[273:17.22]It's doing that thing again.
[273:20.72]If we don't do it in 10 tries, we have to both eat an Arby's Euro.
[273:25.33]I honestly think we'll get it in like three.
[273:29.16]You're underestimating how incredibly... I'm just trying to get like believers to give the doubters money.
[273:34.13]Yeah.
[273:37.41]I don't know if it already passed.
[273:38.51]Okay.
[273:48.76]Jerma beat this game I beat this game I'm an accomplished gamer I shit my pants to win a quick play game in Overwatch like I'm a born again gamer be careful how many times you say that though because I feel like that's like your legacy if you continue to say that it is that's that that turns into legacy if uh if that's continued to be kind of spoken of I don't know it's fine it's it's in my um I think it's in my channel information is it really
[274:17.26]It might be.
[274:17.80]I'd have to double check.
[274:18.42]That's actually really funny.
[274:21.94]I'm actually kind of envious that you shit your pants and put it in your bio.
[274:25.24]Because that's... I feel like that's actually really funny.
[274:29.48]It's the kind of guy I am.
[274:30.66]I'll do it.
[274:31.30]Alright, let's go.

[277:58.92]I told you, dude.
[278:02.43]I fucking told you.
[278:04.15]I got Morgott's Great Rune.
[278:06.25]Same.
[278:12.39]You didn't believe in three.
[278:13.62]We were just so fucking weak.
[278:14.86]It's the same thing as Placidusax.
[278:18.80]We should not have been fighting her yet.
[278:21.48]Yeah, I mean.
[278:22.62]Boop, boop.
[278:26.06]Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
[278:28.66]Fuck.
[278:32.01]nice you earned a moment from Jerma 985 time to claim yeah dude I'm sorry like for being so fucked up but you want to you know roman up one time what yeah I'm celibate dude let me just say something real quick yeah if you want to do that I guess that sounds like fun but just maybe don't talk so much shit next time
[279:01.52]Who were you talking to?
[279:16.67]Millenia was fucking calling me!
[279:24.45]What?
[279:27.88]my chat asks and I ask is Jerma's brand weed now only for this one jokey dumb thing where like we're rolling blunts with placidus and like just for like the last couple of days I don't know you've changed
[279:51.86]Wait, did you miss the point?
[279:52.68]Did you miss that fact that that was Malenia calling me being like, hey, let's like, let's like fucking squash the beef and like, I missed a lot of something because it looked like you were like praying at the altar.
[280:03.76]Like you walked up to the altar and you just started talking to yourself like you could hear God's voice.
[280:09.91]You guys don't get it.
[280:19.19]Jerma has reefer madness.
[280:23.97]We're worried about you.
[280:25.11]Are we ready?
[280:25.51]Yeah, let's go kill Rykard.
[280:29.24]I think it's going to be a Radon and you think it's going to be a putrid slob.
[280:33.96]I think we have not seen a putrid slob in a while.
[280:44.56]Putrid slob.
[280:47.08]Did you end up making a character in the Myriad?
[280:49.52]Yeah.
[280:50.46]What was it like the putrid disgusting slob or something?
[280:55.37]Oh my God, I didn't... I think it was just the Great Putrid Slob.
[280:57.93]I think is all it is.
[281:02.39]He was charging that up.
[281:04.31]He so badly wanted to do that move to us.
[281:06.21]He's just like... Bro, come on!
[281:19.67]I'm inside of the bear.
[281:25.53]Malenia I sleep giant bear I awaken for the meme this guy's shooting crossbows there's a dog do you remember when these dogs would like multi hit you like 16 times and you'd instantly die you're dead I got knocked off by the bear I I'm relating to that content right now
[281:53.14]I'm not gonna even reset it.
[281:54.52]I'm just gonna come over to where you are.
[281:57.42]I have one of those things.
[282:16.94]Did you kill a bear?
[282:18.81]Ow.
[282:19.37]No, help.
[282:21.15]I died.
[282:22.11]He's scary.
[282:33.36]He's just roaring at you.
[282:41.33]Nice kill.
[282:42.33]You're welcome.
[282:43.37]Yeah, we're going to put that head up above my fireplace.
[282:49.47]Ooh, okay.
[282:51.87]Let everyone know.
[282:54.13]Rykard.
[283:11.36]I hope wherever it is, they still get the voice lines.
[283:14.02]Like how Margit was saying shit earlier.
[283:17.21]I would have imagined that's the case.
[283:24.20]wait did you ask me what's like your top favorite thing you would ever want to do or something what was at some point where you were like hey what's like the number one thing you want to do want to do like just like in general I've never asked that but sure you can continue okay
[283:41.47]You know those lava places?
[283:43.88]Where you get, like, you can take, like, the poker and, like, poke the gooey lava and it kind of... Those places in the world?
[283:51.86]I want to go there eventually.
[283:55.72]You want to poke... If you could do anything, you want to poke lava.
[283:59.73]I think, like, going to one of those lava sites, whatever they are.
[284:02.21]They're called volcanoes.
[284:05.05]Yeah, but, like, there's a safe specific place where there's some kind of just running down, like, kind of like this.
[284:10.57]And you can kind of just go look at it and, like, poke it and stuff.
[284:17.04]Okay.
[284:18.28]Don't act like half of you have not watched the YouTube videos with people doing that.
[284:22.46]It's like, whoa, cool.
[284:23.36]It's, like, scientific.
[284:24.36]And don't bat test it.
[284:25.30]I will fucking end my stream.
[284:32.16]Don't hurt this guy!
[284:36.96]Did he just groan like that hurt him to do that?
[284:43.00]Oh, I see.
[284:43.91]You're picking on him.
[284:45.97]Boo!
[284:48.69]That sucked!
[284:49.47]Boo!
[284:50.65]Boo!
[284:53.51]Awful!
[284:54.63]And yet he persists.
[284:58.40]Play something else!
[285:03.31]Not very good.
[285:08.02]Holy shit.
[285:10.06]He gets to live.
[285:29.93]I don't want to talk about it either.
[285:33.50]So you instantly kill the jar enemies, but you'll leave the horn guy alone.
[285:39.60]You like the jar?
[285:40.84]I didn't know that was... You never said, like, do not kill the jar.
[285:44.99]Didn't need to be said.
[285:45.81]Oh, don't kill the rat.
[285:47.19]You'll kill your rat.
[285:50.53]Little rabies, and it has, like, pus on it.
[285:55.98]Joe, can you do this in real life?
[285:58.24]What?
[285:59.82]You know.
[286:02.52]Can I fight a bear in real life?
[286:06.18]He's not even a fan of Elden Ring.
[286:14.58]What?
[286:16.86]Dude, go poke some lava, dude.
[286:19.60]Don't act like that wouldn't be fun, please.
[286:23.30]I think it'd be more fun to roast marshmallows over it.
[286:25.24]It'd be fun just to kind of just do it.
[286:27.26]I think just be like experience like, oh, I have
[286:32.30]Oh my god, that was brutal.
[286:34.39]That woman in a wheelchair.
[286:37.95]What?
[286:39.89]She can't walk, dude.
[286:41.73]Wait, she was in a wheelchair?
[286:43.95]She should be.
[286:44.63]Oh, I... I was like, what are you... This isn't like... Troll knight sword.
[286:48.75]Uh-oh.
[286:56.64]Bro, you are fucked.
[287:00.06]Alright.
[287:01.24]We're almost there.
[287:06.32]I have low healing.
[287:07.66]If this is a tough enemy and you're poison.
[287:11.08]Leave quick.
[287:13.26]Jesus Christ.
[287:15.08]I think you died.
[287:17.78]My screen faded to black and then it pulled me back and it was like, nah, dude, you're actually dead.
[287:23.80]I have the Grace.
[287:24.40]I don't know if it matters.
[287:25.24]I think we can warp to it.
[287:32.56]Dude, I had 700,000 souls on me.
[287:36.14]A lot.
[287:37.39]Can you start a vote?
[287:38.45]Can you do it?
[287:50.46]Yep.
[287:50.80]Yeah.
[287:52.82]Don't skip the cutscene.
[287:53.68]We won't.
[287:57.92]Ster has been wanting to hear this guy talk for the last four streams.
[288:02.35]I love this guy.
[288:07.52]do you think it would be convenient if the rapture happened soon and then you can get a volcano in Las Vegas and then you could just do it there why does a rapture have to happen alright wait wait wait wait they need to vote oh I'm just saying would it be easier to wait for the rapture it would be easier just to take a vacation than wait for humanity to end I think as the question you're like
[288:40.90]Are you going to go on this vacation in the next, like, year?
[288:43.50]I don't know.
[288:43.96]Do you think the world is going... Do you think the rapture is going to happen in the next 12 months?
[288:50.51]Probably.
[288:51.05]I'd say two years.
[288:54.39]Actually, you know what?
[288:54.99]I mean, this could be.
[288:56.25]I'll start planning a vacation, I think.
[289:03.19]There's not very many non-believers, so... I'm a blind samurai.
[289:11.84]Let's go.
[289:19.08]It's phase one horror, Lou.
[289:21.06]It's Godfrey.
[289:23.19]I can't enter.
[289:23.87]I think you're in the cutscene that I've been wanting to watch.
[289:31.05]There is no cutscene.
[289:32.85]Oh, okay.
[289:35.09]Godfrey Devouring Serpent.
[289:39.45]It's a serpent that only likes to eat Godfrey's.
[289:44.56]He's had one meal.
[289:47.48]He's eaten once and it was enough.
[289:50.16]Then the family found out that like, oh, they only eat Godfrey's.
[289:53.09]Let's call our new son Godfrey.
[290:03.19]He's probably got two phases.
[290:04.36]Keep in mind.
[290:05.76]That's true.
[290:23.08]Quick.
[290:37.09]Big smash.
[290:39.97]That was so incredibly loud.
[290:43.55]It actually was.
[290:44.57]I wasn't going to say anything, but it was.
[290:46.38]That was like you eating.
[290:48.78]That was a big crunch.
[290:54.04]This is a reenactment.
[290:57.06]Oh, shit.
[290:57.90]Oh, my God.
[291:00.34]I'm just, I'm just, where am I hit?
[291:08.40]Oh, here it is.
[291:10.28]Please, go, please, go free.
[291:23.12]My game is lagging to fucking shit too.
[291:29.47]It's really hard to dodge this when he's not doing them at you.
[291:32.61]It actually is.
[291:33.25]Oh killed me.
[291:37.58]Oh Ster going down.
[291:47.52]OK, is there a phase two?
[291:50.25]Please mad soldier.
[291:52.07]I'm out of healing.
[291:55.13]Uh oh.
[291:56.09]Together we shall be family.
[291:59.97]Or something.
[292:00.53]I can't remember.
[292:01.74]I'm watching the cutscene.
[292:10.08]Who could it be though?
[292:12.18]Redan?
[292:14.43]If it's Redan, then we paid out a lot of money to the non-believers.
[292:27.57]Very well.
[292:58.06]This guy looks like you.
[293:04.70]You would talk over the exact moment where he says together.
[293:07.26]Oh, actually, this might suck.
[293:14.87]It's Margot.
[293:21.09]Maybe not.
[293:21.57]I think it'll be alright.
[293:24.80]Wait, doesn't Margot have a Phase 2?
[293:26.02]Are we gonna get, like, the Phase 2 Inception?
[293:32.80]I'm Margot.
[293:36.98]I'm just pissed at you, man.
[293:37.92]Let's go watch it on YouTube.
[293:41.38]Uh-oh.
[294:04.76]Tomato Adam.
[294:11.88]He so badly wants you to die.
[294:13.36]I have no health.
[294:14.52]Uh-oh.
[294:28.16]Uh-oh.
[294:31.37]He's got me.
[294:33.39]Good thing I healed right there.
[294:50.36]Believers, let's go.
[295:02.27]There's just four golden seeds.
[295:03.45]I don't know what I don't know what is with my seed.
[295:10.23]That I get all the seeds.
[295:11.61]I'm just guessing right there.
[295:12.57]Oh, by the way, rest we come back.
[295:17.31]See what happens when we come back here.
[295:20.63]Oh no, oh dude.
[295:29.59]You alright?
[295:30.73]Yeah, I'm just excited.
[295:35.87]I think we actually have to leave and then come back.
[295:37.45]Yeah.
[295:41.39]Yo, I just got a moment.
[295:52.98]So do you think that because of this scene here that there will be some, Rycard will be in the DLC?
[295:58.37]I don't know.
[296:02.97]I don't think there is DLC.
[296:03.99]You just don't think that's going to happen?
[296:06.49]I think they were going to make DLC.
[296:07.59]Wait, wait, wait.
[296:08.33]What if we just sold them another game?
[296:09.80]I don't know.
[296:10.44]Give the dancers... You can move him.
[296:14.98]Move who?
[296:16.02]You just were moving his head.
[296:18.00]I can't see them.
[296:20.22]Keep doing that.
[296:22.73]Wait.
[296:23.15]Stand right where I... Just walk with me.
[296:28.87]Is there an edge?
[296:32.77]Come over to me.
[296:35.43]Go exactly where I am.
[296:37.87]And walk forward.
[296:43.48]You're kind of running in place.
[296:45.96]You're moving his head around.
[296:47.22]Okay.
[296:50.72]Can we just take him with us?
[296:54.88]Can we put him into a fire?
[296:56.26]Okay, so should I give this?
[297:01.43]Give the dancer... I've never seen this before.
[297:07.64]What does this do?
[297:14.74]What?
[297:17.70]What?
[297:17.92]That didn't do anything.
[297:26.11]So you can't see this at all?
[297:28.01]Nope.
[297:28.37]So what if I just kill her?
[297:30.71]Oh, God.
[297:31.45]That's worse than if you killed the musician.
[297:33.93]That's all.
[297:34.63]The jellyfish.
[297:41.84]Maybe it's better if I do it because I can't even see.
[297:43.62]Oh no, Tannis Knight.
[297:45.08]It's one of these like skeleton people.
[297:48.49]By the way, are you attacking this?
[297:52.29]I know.
[297:52.97]I can't see anything.
[297:54.35]It's just you.
[298:00.69]This is kind of a discount bodyguard.
[298:12.36]Wow.
[298:14.82]I got a glass shard.
[298:20.17]Worth it.
[298:24.59]Alright.
[298:26.63]If we reset it, will you see it?
[298:32.77]You sat down and I heard her start talking, but I can't see her.
[298:36.43]Yeah, you try.
[298:39.07]I mean, I don't think we have to do anything here.
[298:41.47]No, we don't.
[298:43.33]Alright.
[298:45.61]So we can go to Farum Azula and do Farum Azula.
[298:53.45]Go from Maliketh.
[298:57.65]How's that sound?
[298:59.05]Sounds great.
[299:00.77]What if and hear me out.
[299:03.13]Sure.
[299:05.03]What if we did it tomorrow?
[299:06.97]Cannot do it tomorrow.
[299:09.85]But tomorrow was going to be the day that we were going to do it.
[299:11.65]It was, but when it became, when we decided that, hey, today we're doing it instead, I made a specific plan tomorrow.
[299:20.25]Without me.
[299:21.81]Well, because we did it today.
[299:24.61]You didn't ask for permission if you could do it tomorrow.
[299:28.33]I'm sorry.
[299:31.13]Do you- do you- I- do you want- you- you gotta go?
[299:34.13]No I'm just- it's- I just feel like my general health and well-being has been-
[299:40.13]Alright, okay so then- yeah then let's- let's call it then. Let's call it if you general- we don't want to-
[299:44.13]Let's do Farum Azula.
[299:45.13]No, no, no, no, no, no- Wait.
[299:48.13]So that was like: Oh hey, you having fun? What else are we doing today?
[299:51.00]That was your version of that, right?
[299:55.44]Like, oh, yeah, this game Ember, yeah, it's, like, really fun, but, like, what else is going on?
[299:59.24]That was your version of that?
[300:01.07]No, that was my version of, like, we could just play tomorrow, but now that playing tomorrow is off the table because you took it away.
[300:08.83]Alright, but, like, are you feeling alright?
[300:11.69]Like, are you okay?
[300:12.59]Like, we can stop right now.
[300:14.28]If we stopped playing, I would, like, eat a real meal, and then I would honestly, I don't know, play Nioh.
[300:22.36]So it's fine.
[300:23.02]Are you going to stream Nioh?
[300:24.92]No god no.
[300:25.92]No god no? Alright.
[300:27.92]They'll tell me that I- I missed a qi pulse and I'll just- it'll send me over the edge.
[300:31.92]He wants to play Nioh. What? He wants to play Nioh. He wants to play Nioh so bad.
[300:40.92]Alright well then- wait wait wait I have a proposition. Proposition for you.
[300:44.00]Okay proposition.
[300:45.00]If you want to play let's- let's just go beat the game. It will not take us very long.
[300:51.46]But then that means we're never playing again.
[300:54.36]What I wanted to do was play tomorrow, and what you're suggesting is to go beat the game so we never have to play it again.
[301:08.68]I mean, that's not necessarily true.
[301:11.56]It's just... When would you want to play again?
[301:16.91]Like, if we're not playing tomorrow.
[301:18.37]Like, we're not playing tomorrow.
[301:19.75]When would you like to play?
[301:20.63]Like, another weekend thing?
[301:21.67]Like, let's do it on the weekend?
[301:22.81]I guess it would be Saturday, and that's a long time.
[301:25.26]That's kind of a long time.
[301:27.38]Like, you just want to... We can go in the Elden Tree now?
[301:31.36]Can we?
[301:35.34]I mean, we could just pick it up again at some point in the next few days or something.
[301:40.92]We don't have to play it anymore.
[301:43.28]We could just stop for now.
[301:45.09]And just in like, I don't know, a few days.
[301:46.67]We don't have to wait till the weekend.
[301:49.59]Well, I thought we had to go through like the destroyed Landel.
[301:55.50]We do.
[301:56.38]When does that happen?
[301:57.16]I think we have to kill Maliketh.
[302:00.64]Who is in Faramazoola.
[302:02.94]Let's do Faramazoola, man.
[302:04.42]They want it.
[302:08.16]Let me make this really, really clear.
[302:10.90]I am willing to play again some other time in the next week or something if you want to get food and just leave.
[302:17.91]That's all good.
[302:18.83]No, I'm fine.
[302:21.39]Okay.
[302:21.99]I'm fine.
[302:22.45]I'm just very sad.
[302:25.75]The Nioh case is on your desk and you keep looking at it.
[302:30.90]I said I wasn't gonna play Nioh until we beat Elden Ring because I don't want to mess up my brain again.
[302:35.00]So then okay so the next time we play this just let's beat this let's complete it so then it's a complete arc and then we're good to go.
[302:44.00]And we can do it whatever, you can just go back to play Nioh and whatever.
[302:48.00]And then we're never gonna talk again.
[302:53.00]I'm and- I'm already in the best timeline right now. Let's go to Farum Azula.
[303:00.08]I just don't know what he wants.
[303:02.83]I'm saying what I want.
[303:04.57]I'm saying let's go to farm Azula.
[303:06.45]I'm going to do.
[303:07.75]I'm going.
[303:13.58]Every art must be finite.
[303:15.54]Remember that?
[303:16.04]I do.
[303:17.67]I do remember that.
[303:18.57]That's true.
[303:23.02]That's why I ate that pork.
[303:24.42]He just wants to spend more time with you, Germo.
[303:26.94]Well, I didn't want to stop playing.
[303:28.84]He wanted to call it.
[303:30.08]Which makes it perfectly understandable.
[303:31.89]I only wanted to call it because I thought we were playing tomorrow.
[303:35.93]But if we're not playing tomorrow... We are not playing tomorrow.
[303:39.03]Then I need my fucking fix.
[303:42.01]I need my fill.
[303:42.99]So what's going to happen here then?
[303:45.18]There's a dragon here.
[303:52.24]I guess nothing.
[303:53.20]I think it's a dog.
[303:55.30]It's like a little dog.
[303:57.44]What is that?
[304:09.72]That's sad.
[304:11.94]Yeah.
[304:13.60]Well, you know what they say.
[304:15.40]You got everything has to end.
[304:16.68]Watch Dogs staff.
[304:18.38]I've never seen that before.
[304:20.06]Oh, you want to play Watch Dogs?
[304:22.79]No.
[304:25.50]I saw Watch Dogs Legion the other day, like a day or two ago.
[304:28.30]It was on sale for like $12 and I was like... Too expensive.
[304:31.48]That's too expensive.
[304:33.72]That's a bit much.
[304:36.60]I streamed Watch Dogs Legion on launch.
[304:39.44]I never even played it.
[304:41.06]How was it?
[304:43.40]It was an unbelievably miserable experience.
[304:48.20]The game just crashed every... I felt like every 30 or 40 minutes, I was hard-locking.
[304:57.00]It was so bad.
[304:59.99]Sombra, Smithing Stone, 9.
[305:02.07]Were you looking for these?
[305:03.15]We're fully upgraded.
[305:04.75]Yeah.
[305:06.01]The game's over, man.
[305:07.37]No, Saj, don't say that.
[305:09.95]We just have to go kill Majula.
[305:14.04]What's his name?
[305:15.36]Malakaf.
[305:15.88]Majula.
[305:17.85]You really do like Dark Souls 2.
[305:20.67]I don't remember what that word is.
[305:22.19]That's the town?
[305:23.73]Jewel is the town in Dark Souls 2.
[305:25.37]I don't know where I conjured that from.
[305:26.71]That was a, like, Mr. Finster moment.
[305:32.30]There is a boss with a double Godskin somewhere down here, right?
[305:36.64]We got assassin in the room.
[305:38.00]Invisible assassin in the room.
[305:47.68]watch your butt watch your back he's murdering you he's got a lot of health oh scream
[306:12.30]There's a new adversary.
[306:14.42]I'm being, I'm being murdered.
[306:18.06]I hope he's not like the good kind of murderers like Dexter though.
[306:38.72]This place, oh wait, we talked about our favorite areas.
[306:40.72]It might actually be this place.
[306:44.02]This is a very cool spot.
[306:45.52]Big tornado.
[306:49.03]Big tornado.
[307:09.42]Cat sound.
[307:13.37]I got one guide.
[307:19.73]Why do you want Destined Death?
[307:23.39]Jarnished.
[307:28.12]Because everything's finite and we have to end the run, Malakath.
[307:33.36]So we're like speed running to Elden Beast.
[307:36.23]God, are you fucking my bungus?
[307:40.63]Can we just run?
[307:43.81]He's just dreaming of Nioh 2.
[307:46.65]Hey!
[307:49.77]He's invisible, man.
[307:50.99]Alright, well, let's go then.
[307:55.66]I don't know where we go.
[308:02.42]I forget.
[308:03.68]Why am I following you?
[308:04.78]I should not be following you.
[308:06.04]We need to go.
[308:06.58]Whoa!
[308:13.31]Good one.
[308:17.03]You got like this aura of rushing on me now.
[308:27.19]Well, I mean, game's over.
[308:29.13]I'm going to sit down.
[308:30.42]Sorry.
[308:31.78]Okay, no, that works.
[308:35.54]Isn't there supposed to be a... Oh.
[308:46.66]I'm at the bonfire.
[308:48.31]I'm coming.
[308:49.57]Who's going to be our godskin duo?
[308:50.81]How about that?
[308:52.15]How about them apples?
[308:53.87]Will it be a duo is a good question, I think.
[308:55.85]Do you think it'll be a duo?
[308:57.51]I don't know.
[309:00.27]Our Valiant Gargoyle wasn't.
[309:02.25]It was not.
[309:03.67]Yeah, I don't think it will.
[309:04.51]It seems like it pairs duos together randomly.
[309:09.19]I mean, I'm honestly just waiting for it, Dan.
[309:12.39]It's one of the only people we haven't seen.
[309:14.26]uh yeah uh-huh yeah that's one of the only people well major bosses I mean who's a major boss we haven't seen yet um cornelius we saw him oh yeah that was early on
[309:32.63]Radagon, that's right.
[309:33.79]We haven't seen Radagon.
[309:34.63]Real Moog?
[309:35.87]We haven't seen real Mohg.
[309:38.25]We haven't seen Radagon.
[309:39.69]We haven't seen Redan.
[309:42.03]Why do you say Moog-like, but then you say Mohg?
[309:44.97]I say Mohg-like.
[309:47.56]Do you?
[309:48.16]Yes.
[309:51.14]Hey, sorry, enemy.
[309:51.94]We're like, we're like, we have to like end the golden ring.
[309:58.42]We're on time.
[310:13.20]Ah, I just got huge chills.
[310:15.89]Chills?
[310:16.39]Oh!
[310:31.68]Okay, can you do the skip?
[310:33.94]I don't know.
[310:34.82]Let's practice it for a few hours.
[310:36.90]Wait, I don't know if I... Maybe I have tried it once or twice.
[310:39.04]Oh, you mean this thing where you go...
[310:43.02]You go.
[310:50.48]You gotta back step.
[310:56.31]Your vibes are off.
[310:56.97]You don't have to do it.
[310:57.67]Let's go.
[310:59.13]I was fucking rolled off the edge.
[311:10.95]I've only picked up Smithing Stone sevens.
[311:13.60]So you're going to rent out a studio for the scream stream or are you going to like just do it at home?
[311:35.07]Um,
[311:41.17]I don't know whatever you said.
[311:42.07]Alright, this is it.
[311:45.50]Where are they?
[311:50.22]Oh, it's this guy.
[311:52.00]This this I did not like this guy and I did not like Malenia.
[311:57.61]This guy is my Malenia really?
[312:02.99]I think we'll be alright.
[312:04.07]We're pretty level.
[312:05.17]I think he's lower HP probably, but like this guy cheats.
[312:09.76]Why do I feel like half the bosses we fought had this music?
[312:13.03]I feel like it was the only music we've heard.
[312:19.60]This is the Elden Ring boss music for all we are concerned.
[312:39.79]This guy's attacks are just totally random.
[312:42.27]At least Malenia goes up in the air and lets you know she's going to do some bullshit.
[312:45.17]This guy's just like constantly spinning in circles and summoning guys and there's frostbite everywhere and you can't see your screen.
[312:51.07]That's like a thousand particle effects.
[312:56.39]And he's got the boys with him.
[312:57.72]Not anymore.
[312:59.12]What is he even doing right now?
[313:00.64]What is he doing?
[313:02.20]It's a big circle splash.
[313:05.06]And then he goes down and you have an opportunity to hit him.
[313:08.16]Well, did you?
[313:09.10]Yes, look at that.
[313:16.83]Honestly, how is this guy not Elden fucking Lord?
[313:21.37]He doesn't want it.
[313:22.81]Hoarah Loux is a naked guy.
[313:31.62]He seems to be doing this move a lot, though.
[313:38.41]Would you do any other move?
[313:40.53]Maybe.
[314:01.84]At least it doesn't heal when he hits you.
[314:27.27]Why me I'm out of here
[314:38.54]We got it.
[314:48.45]Don't worry, I'm here.
[314:49.73]I'm here.
[314:50.93]Thanks big bro.
[314:59.15]See nothing bad.
[315:02.47]Yeah, well millennial was actually easier.
[315:06.83]It's a lot of souls.
[315:07.89]Holy shit.
[315:24.74]I actually can do it again.
[315:26.24]I can do it a couple more times actually, can't I?
[315:30.90]60 strength?
[315:33.24]Do it.
[315:35.14]Oh yeah, let's go.
[315:36.86]Oh yeah.
[315:42.16]Yeah, OK, cool.
[315:44.80]Wrong door.
[315:45.94]Where am I?
[315:46.33]My soul isn't in here.
[315:47.61]No.
[315:53.11]I got it.
[315:53.41]Yeah, we got a bell free key.
[315:54.25]Another one.
[315:55.47]Is this the wrong way too?
[315:57.51]There's like three doors in this room.
[315:59.35]We go up.
[316:00.63]No, you're wrong.
[316:01.51]No, no, no, no, no.
[316:02.35]This door.
[316:03.13]No, no.
[316:03.53]This door.
[316:04.07]Don't we go?
[316:04.47]We go up around.
[316:05.65]We go into this door.
[316:12.04]Then you get the bonfire right next to the bonfire.
[316:19.36]A lot of people die on those stairs.
[316:21.68]This way, that way, this way, that way.
[316:24.42]This is the wrong way.
[316:26.32]I was listening to you.
[316:29.06]Your first mistake.
[316:31.24]Honestly, Ster is scarier than Jerma.
[316:34.43]Scarier?
[316:37.91]I'm just reading what they said.
[316:40.91]What have I done that's scary?
[316:44.85]I don't know.
[316:54.18]I think it's because the shit your pants story.
[316:56.69]I think that they're having trouble getting over that.
[316:58.51]This is not the right way.
[317:00.73]This is just like.
[317:02.47]Regular Zula.
[317:06.86]Then that's the guy that it's the other door other other door.
[317:21.81]It's his vibes.
[317:22.93]They're just something a bit off about.
[317:24.75]His vibes are off.
[317:30.21]And then... We can go that way.
[317:34.91]Yeah, kind of.
[317:37.57]Do we go around here?
[317:39.19]We have to go up around where that bridge is to go to where... Hold on.
[317:46.54]Dude, we're getting doored right now.
[317:50.19]This isn't it.
[317:51.21]That's where we came in.
[317:52.21]We picked the three wrong doors.
[317:54.77]We... Back to the boss room.
[317:58.16]We picked the one... There's literally four doors.
[318:00.14]We picked three wrong doors.
[318:01.66]I believe it's this door.
[318:05.58]We just went down this one.
[318:07.16]Okay, then the other... Across, across, across, across.
[318:12.08]He's just like... He's just in Nioh right now.
[318:17.89]Ster is just more unfiltered. That's true. Jerma thinks the things like he's thinking about killing you but he won't say it.
[318:25.89]So he's more dangerous because he's more unpredictable.
[318:37.62]Don't true that.
[318:38.92]Don't true him.
[318:41.18]Do not give him any more power than he deserves.
[318:45.09]For everything he says, there's like four things he didn't say and they're sadistic.
[318:51.35]Are you going to fight this crab or am I going to have to do all the fucking work?
[319:00.04]Ster is right.
[319:01.00]This way, that way.
[319:03.16]This way, that way.
[319:09.49]Hey, big boy.
[319:12.53]He's going to fall.
[319:13.41]He's going to fall and we're going to laugh in his fucking face.
[319:15.95]He's going to scream at us and we're going to fall backwards.
[319:22.27]I told you.
[319:23.75]I thought you were going down.
[319:30.61]Hey, do this IRL.

[320:42.91]You did other shit that was cool and it was good.
[320:46.01]Yeah, but the Fortnite arc, if that's what we're talking about, is my greatest, darkest days.
[320:51.68]You could have been on the ground level of the BR Fortnite arc.
[320:57.64]No, motherfucker!
[320:59.84]What'd you go?
[321:00.26]You shouted at me and I went... No!
[321:02.12]No!
[321:06.24]His shout pulled me rather than pushed me.
[321:15.43]It's alright.
[321:17.76]Yeah, it's okay.
[321:19.30]Rest because we're pretty low.

[322:21.58]It's called like Left 4 Dead.
[322:23.80]I played Left 4 Dead when I was a wee lad.
[322:25.95]This one's going to be great.
[322:28.65]It's like the same game.
[322:29.91]Dude, Left 4 Dead 2.
[322:33.75]Excuse me.
[322:34.45]Left 4 Dead 2 was actually fucking incredible.
[322:36.87]That's what I'm saying.
[322:38.17]I'm talking shit about Back 4 Blood.
[322:43.54]Are we going the right way?
[322:45.64]Oh, Back 4 Blood from the developers of Evolve.
[322:49.28]Oh, alright, yeah, okay, okay, I'll try that game.
[322:54.98]Fucking... Three head.
[323:02.71]Fucking three head.
[323:05.31]Oh, that's so funny.
[323:08.91]Watch out!
[323:09.37]He's...
[323:16.24]Fuck.
[323:19.90]Can you just pull me down?
[323:21.04]Can you just pull me down?
[323:22.27]Can you just pull me over there?
[323:24.01]Just pull me over there.
[323:25.01]That's the perfect enemy to be there.
[323:29.59]Where's the bonfire up here?
[323:35.46]I don't remember where I'm going.
[323:38.44]I hope Mad Soldier is in the Elden Beast room.
[323:40.82]I really do.
[323:43.40]It'd make me so happy.
[323:54.26]I love that game.
[323:58.24]It's a fucking Back 4 Blood, mate.
[324:01.18]It's one of my favorite fucking games.
[324:03.14]Oh, I fucking love that game.
[324:06.14]I don't even know what you're doing, but it's funny.
[324:10.10]I don't even fucking get it.
[324:12.23]I don't know either.
[324:14.13]I'm just imagining someone excited for Back 4 Blood.
[324:17.81]Dude, I fucking love that game.
[324:21.33]You're extra silly today.
[324:22.65]You really are.
[324:25.55]You need to teleport?
[324:27.31]No, I'm alright.
[324:28.11]I'm here.
[324:28.49]I mean, it doesn't look like you're here.
[324:31.71]It looks like you're pretty far.
[324:33.89]I made it down.
[324:35.73]I'm coming here.
[324:38.57]Just that British accent.
[324:53.52]Where are you?
[324:55.45]I'm at the nearest.
[324:57.87]You drop down here.
[324:58.85]That was a good grunt.
[325:05.95]Oh, I couldn't even replicate.
[325:08.19]Oh, that's right.
[325:08.63]Then this is where the lightning dragon.
[325:11.73]Oh, yeah.
[325:12.45]Oh, I remember now.
[325:13.77]Oh, yes.
[325:15.05]Oh, yes.
[325:15.83]Oh, dear.
[325:16.77]Oh, yeah.
[325:17.90]Oh, yeah.
[325:19.02]Wow.
[325:19.28]Frogger killed himself.
[325:21.68]Oh, yes.
[325:24.02]Oh, yes.
[325:34.59]Is it the same dragon?
[325:36.07]I think this is scripted.
[325:37.63]Something is just shooting the shit out of us.
[325:42.15]The dragon's not even here.
[325:44.07]Yeah, it wouldn't even be loaded in yet.
[325:45.93]It's like scripted laser beams.
[325:47.63]Wow.
[325:48.91]Wow, dude.
[325:51.11]That's my favorite fucking game.
[325:59.18]The last year or so really has felt like everyone all at once made the four player co-op game.
[326:05.98]It feels like something that happens in waves.
[326:08.40]Do you remember all the... It seemed like everybody was making a VR game.
[326:14.84]Everybody was making the League of Legends kind of, you know, top-down game.
[326:20.98]In like five years from now, there's going to be like six Elden Ring likes come out.
[326:25.20]Because everyone got like, oh, dude, this game's so good.
[326:27.51]Let's make one.
[326:28.79]All at the same time.
[326:29.59]I feel like that kind of started happening.
[326:31.77]Like, a lot.
[326:33.15]I mean, they made a Star Wars game that was like a Souls-like.
[326:36.63]What?
[326:36.87]Which one?
[326:38.27]Fallen Order.
[326:40.41]Jedi Fallen Order is a Souls-like.
[326:42.09]I guess.
[326:44.63]I mean, it is.
[326:45.97]I never played it, but it seemed that way.
[326:49.03]It is 100% a Souls-like.
[326:52.37]They're just called action RPGs, dude.
[326:55.39]No, you cannot tell me that Fallen Order is not supposed to be a Souls-like.
[327:00.15]Come on.
[327:09.48]It is.
[327:28.90]Uh, you want to, um, you want to just go check and see if it's what's down here.
[327:38.00]Can we, can we, yeah.
[327:43.11]Can we even activate it?
[327:44.93]This is, I think so.
[327:48.55]You just lay down in it.
[327:49.53]Yeah.
[327:49.77]Get the bonfire first though.
[327:50.89]For sure.
[327:59.12]You just have to lie down.
[328:02.31]That's good.
[328:02.97]You just have to lie down and let it happen.
[328:05.63]Where is the bonfire?
[328:06.61]Did we miss it?
[328:07.71]I don't know.
[328:11.20]There's like an elevator around here.
[328:12.52]Oh, it's right here.
[328:16.20]On the elevator.
[328:16.70]Alright, I'll set it back for you.
[328:22.89]Nah, I'm good.
[328:24.09]I'm nice like that.
[328:24.85]I'll set it back for you.
[328:27.90]Did I play Sekiro?
[328:28.70]I did.
[328:29.96]I completed Sekiro.
[328:31.18]I beat the whole thing.
[328:31.88]A true ending.
[328:37.87]And that game was a living hell.
[328:41.64]Oh, on that note, you're asking, like,
[328:45.50]Sekiro or Nero was harder.
[328:46.86]Right.
[328:47.92]I feel like there's some people in chat like, can you just stop bringing up Nero?
[328:50.75]I don't even want to say it, but like you did ask.
[328:52.81]No, I did.
[328:53.27]And I was curious.
[328:54.25]The game is harder than Sekiro for sure.
[328:56.92]Why did they all come in here?
[328:58.56]They all heard you.
[329:01.65]These are people in chat that were very mad that you just said that.
[329:04.75]Yeah, I know.
[329:07.26]No, but people... Nioh being harder was, I think, the general consensus when you brought it up four or five last week.
[329:13.36]Yeah, that's what they were saying, and I can confirm.
[329:15.32]I was like, yeah, this is... Where's the safe place to drop?
[329:19.70]Wait, is... No, we gotta go down.
[329:23.36]Just jump, dude.
[329:24.80]No, go down.
[329:28.11]Sekiro is the easiest FromSoftware game.
[329:30.04]Sekiro is easier than Elden Ring.
[329:31.74]I don't think so.
[329:43.05]I feel like Sekiro punishes you way more than Elden Ring does.
[329:47.51]If you miss a couple of those parries, you can just get caught and it's over.
[329:53.62]Uh, we have to go... I think we have to cross this again.
[330:04.02]Yeah, it's like... You seriously just jumped right there.
[330:08.98]I'm doing the fucking hard one.
[330:10.42]You did the one on the left, it was easy.
[330:16.20]I thought there was like a whole different area where you did.
[330:19.32]Where do you drop down?
[330:24.24]Where is it?
[330:25.76]Your chat says wrong way, guys.
[330:32.15]Yeah, do the hard one, but going up.
[330:42.01]Nice.
[330:42.70]Thanks.
[330:46.91]Go back to the bonfire.
[330:50.09]Wait, is it?
[330:50.45]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[330:51.17]Wait, is it over here?
[330:53.11]Where is it?
[330:54.39]I feel like it was way.
[330:55.51]I feel like it was right here.
[330:59.55]It's not just right here.
[331:01.59]I thought it was where that dragon spawns.
[331:03.97]You fight the dragon on that ledge.
[331:05.10]What?
[331:05.26]Where did you go?
[331:13.12]Where?
[331:14.04]So go.
[331:15.24]You're invisible.
[331:16.08]I'm invisible?
[331:17.36]You're hiding.
[331:17.80]Hide and seek.
[331:19.56]OK, there's there's a tiny little ledge.
[331:24.83]Oh, you got it.
[331:29.05]I lose these souls.
[331:29.83]You owe me.
[331:32.55]See, I'm getting a little bit more tired and I'm getting I'm hitting like the weird threshold.
[331:36.05]Yeah, I think you hit the weird.
[331:37.98]I think you've been on the weird threshold for four days.
[331:41.84]I've been pretty tired.
[331:46.18]Slept till like I would have slept a lot today.
[331:48.70]I don't think I ever would have got up if I didn't have to go somewhere.
[331:51.08]I think I just would have been in bed for a week.
[331:52.49]I don't know something like something weird with my stomach.
[331:57.75]I don't know what it is or why.
[332:00.77]You've been checking worms.
[332:03.19]No, I don't see why I would.
[332:04.21]Alright, let's lie down.
[332:33.98]Have you ever checked for worms?
[332:43.08]No, what?
[332:46.93]It's him.
[332:48.77]It's regular Margit?
[332:52.79]Dragonlord Margit this time.
[332:56.29]Put your ambitions to rest, young boy.
[333:14.54]Whoa!
[333:22.19]That does a lot of damage.
[333:38.18]Didn't even say the line.
[333:43.51]Can you imagine?
[333:47.17]Can you imagine if that's what he said?
[333:54.17]I'm sorry.
[333:57.16]-2.
[333:57.80]I don't think it was a -2.
[334:03.64]Actually, everyone.
[334:04.30]Yeah, I agree with chat.
[334:05.38]I have to be part of the chat now.
[334:12.77]Can't you just, like, think for yourself?
[334:16.27]Yeah, sometimes.
[334:34.14]We're going to get so many souls.
[334:36.03]Yeah, it was like 300k.
[334:39.21]I got the halic tree medallions but like we're just gonna speed run to the tree so it doesn't really matter we could always do it again maybe you never know like all things all art has to be finite yeah our next run could be with The Simpsons mod that's true alright 60 strength now I should just dump it all into uh bigger endurance right
[335:17.72]alright we have to pour it out of here so let's pour it back to the dragon temple transept what a guild use better nude mod next time what makes it better than the other what makes it better
[335:45.64]That's true.
[335:54.44]This feels like we went backwards like two bonfires from where we were supposed to be.
[335:59.10]Then let's go to the altar.
[336:01.96]Is the temple where is it?
[336:09.67]I don't.
[336:11.99]Remember Great Bridge side, the great side, the Great Bridge sounds right.
[336:19.18]That sounds good.
[336:25.60]Oh yeah, then we do we go up here and then we would.
[336:31.36]We're going to get rid and one of these times and it's going to be a disaster.
[336:34.82]Dan is going to be in the Eldon Beast room.
[336:36.66]I'm just going to try to prepare myself for it.
[336:41.70]That in the Eldon Beast room is going to be redan and we're not going to be able to have a horse or anything.
[336:45.44]It's going to be awful.
[336:48.69]So just fight him.
[336:50.63]Draw your blade.
[337:07.54]What if it just is Maliketh?
[337:08.86]We haven't even seen him yet.
[337:09.77]That'd be a possibility.
[337:13.71]It's Maliketh.
[337:14.57]It's actually just Maliketh.
[337:16.09]It's Maliketh, man.
[337:17.64]No, it's not.
[337:18.34]It's fucking Mohg.
[337:22.50]This is probably real Mohg.
[337:25.10]Mohg, where did you learn Spanish?
[337:26.30]Look out for the blood.
[337:52.93]Could not make up his mind on who to attack.
[337:58.02]Here it comes.
[337:58.40]Alright, you gotta heal through this.
[338:02.49]No?
[338:03.75]Wait.
[338:05.35]Why are you not doing it?
[338:06.81]He skipped.
[338:07.97]Get him, get him, get him.
[338:14.34]We're unstoppable now.
[338:16.78]I just have too much health.
[338:20.38]Don't let him do it.
[338:20.90]Just kill him before he can do it.
[338:29.99]Hey.
[338:35.75]oh he's got the fire poker you want uh oh new build ow
[339:10.96]I don't want to backseat Moog, but, like, why doesn't he just count to, like, five?
[339:17.57]Just keep doing it.
[339:20.01]Well, he might not have enough mana.
[339:21.07]Probably takes a lot of energy to do that move.
[339:26.88]He can't.
[339:27.38]He can't count to five, dude.
[339:29.58]I don't know how to count to five.
[339:33.34]Seven.
[339:34.46]One.
[339:35.74]Two.
[339:37.37]Three.
[339:38.51]This is phase two.
[339:41.42]Gonna be fucking Redan.
[339:42.38]It's Loretta.
[339:53.65]Loretta 2.
[339:59.39]I used most of my heels just kind of fucking around.
[340:03.13]Why?
[340:03.41]I don't know.
[340:05.59]I just figured we were going to be alright.
[340:09.30]And we were, weren't we?
[340:10.08]I guess a little.
[340:15.84]Your jump attack does so much damage.
[340:18.20]Yep.
[340:35.90]How am I, a lowly kitsune fox girl, gonna compete with your raw strength?
[340:43.71]Because I'm gonna die.
[341:16.40]Uh-oh.
[341:21.62]One hit.
[341:23.81]Yeah!
[341:34.37]We are in a roll right now.

[342:06.80]I don't even know what he's saying.
[342:08.40]I wasn't paying that much attention to what he was saying.
[342:10.08]I was trying to focus on the fight.
[342:12.53]What was happening?
[342:13.21]Someone was accusing me of some heinous, heinous stuff.
[342:20.65]Okay.
[342:23.29]And I just had to correct, you know, set the record straight.
[342:29.46]Oh, wait.
[342:30.78]Who's going to be...
[342:36.99]Gideon.
[342:38.27]Who is going to be Gideon?
[342:43.39]We could role play.
[342:44.15]You could be Gideon.
[342:46.21]Gideon's cool.
[342:49.23]And I'll play Nefeli.
[342:56.82]I don't want that potion.
[342:58.82]I'm a strong warrior, girl.

[344:11.27]I don't have a lot to work with.

[345:27.92]You can wear more.
[345:30.68]It's true.
[345:32.98]It's not fair.
[345:33.72]I want to.
[345:34.10]I want to redo.
[345:42.45]OK, let's go.
[345:44.28]You happy?

[345:54.11]You don't have pants on and you're wearing sandals.
[345:57.23]This is fucking... This is good.
[346:01.56]Look at this shit.
[346:02.96]I'm fucking ready.
[346:13.70]Slay.
[346:16.65]Slay.
[346:21.97]Slay.
[346:30.56]Hello?
[346:34.20]No, you can't go on the horse.
[346:38.24]Tears were streaming down my face at this part.
[346:41.79]You were crying.
[346:42.61]Because you got lost.
[346:43.91]You didn't know where to go.
[346:44.69]I was just like, so fucked up.
[346:48.23]It was so bad.
[346:49.23]You know when you cry a ton.
[346:50.75]It's like, I can't breathe.
[346:54.25]My nose.
[346:55.57]You realize that you did this.
[346:58.11]Why is there a dragon here?
[346:59.49]I don't know.
[347:01.49]Is that Gideon?
[347:04.31]That's not supposed to be Gideon, right?
[347:08.95]You know when you cry a lot and it's like, no, I haven't been crying.
[347:16.72]Has never happened to me.
[347:18.46]We're going the wrong way.
[347:19.48]Why don't you get on your horse?
[347:22.91]I can't.
[347:24.43]We can jump somewhere.
[347:25.19]No, it is this way.
[347:27.73]Come on back here.
[347:29.75]Come on.
[347:31.19]It's going to be a putrid tree avatar.
[347:46.30]He's like, wait, don't go up there yet.
[347:49.60]Please.
[347:49.96]Listen to logic.
[347:52.58]We've suffered enough.
[347:55.03]Listen to logic.
[348:06.32]He's like, stop.
[348:26.35]oh it's Maliketh oh people are still people are still voting I wonder if that's gonna change well gideon always has like no HP right isn't he like die really quickly maybe the health scaling Maliketh does a ton of damage though yeah but like not to me because we like we were cool in high school so I have like the lord debuff bets are locked
[348:52.37]Here we go.
[348:54.77]I mean, they're not, but okay.
[349:13.74]Maliketh.
[349:16.76]Lay your weapons down.
[349:20.52]We will do it with diplomacy.
[349:25.55]Beat his ass!
[349:36.50]Maliketh the all-knowing.
[349:45.00]Oh fuck, Maliketh's actually really strong.
[349:55.93]I'd be on fire!
[350:04.34]What the fuck?
[350:07.30]Double swing.
[350:13.16]Okay, I'm taking it seriously now.
[350:14.76]I wasn't before.
[350:19.15]I'm unlocking my true power.
[350:20.85]Are you?
[350:21.83]Yeah.
[350:30.67]okay he does a lot of damage though that's it that's that's what he's saying on his stream about you there's like two of them and there's one with this jumping attack there's no fucking damage
[350:56.44]I don't have the right build for this.
[350:58.50]I just built jump attacks.
[350:59.78]Holy shit, that did a lot.
[351:02.30]He killed you.
[351:03.42]Yeah.
[351:08.12]I think you can do it.
[351:10.34]I think you're that good.
[351:17.00]Oh, yeah.
[351:18.74]Whoa!
[351:20.06]Did we win?
[351:23.02]Does that count?
[351:24.02]Did he die?
[351:28.08]What happened?
[351:29.76]Does that count?
[351:30.84]I think he jumped off the map.
[351:34.82]He jumped off the map.
[351:36.59]Is he dead?
[351:41.43]How do we score that?
[351:43.43]Do we score that correct?
[351:47.23]He's not dead.
[351:47.87]The fog gate's here.
[351:49.39]What?
[351:52.57]Dude, he disappeared and I fucking insta-died.
[351:55.61]Why did I die?
[351:57.11]Oh yeah, I do have the Maliketh item.
[352:03.49]Do I have to use that?
[352:04.59]Like, what does it matter?
[352:11.52]Did he burn me?
[352:13.48]He, on my screen... He burned you.
[352:15.54]That was so weird.
[352:16.10]He just disappeared and then I died.
[352:17.90]It was the death burn.
[352:22.67]uh Ster how would you how would you score that that doesn't does that is that just a refund or is that like a we lost he's not actually dead we lost because if we if we can enter here and he's still alive then we didn't kill him fuck fuck we didn't win we lost let's just make sure he's actually hold on let's just open it up
[352:49.45]We lost.
[352:49.83]I'm sorry, Believer's butt.
[352:51.71]Let's fight him in this area where he can jump off.
[352:53.83]Yeah, let him just jump.
[352:57.95]Okay.
[352:59.15]He really did not want to attack you, apparently.
[353:03.04]Okay.
[353:04.94]He killed you in fucking two seconds, dude.
[353:09.62]Well, I mean, you just watched.
[353:11.22]Oh, shit.
[353:12.42]What are you doing?
[353:13.34]I was trying to bait him over the edge.
[353:19.30]I was trying to bait him over the edge.
[353:20.34]I was trying to get him to jump.
[353:27.74]That's so stupid.
[353:34.32]What if we did stealth?
[353:37.70]What do you mean?
[353:41.43]What if we like, like we just stealth in because we know where he is and we just backstab him.
[353:46.95]No, we need to just stand over here.
[353:49.38]Let's just fight him over here, but you have to actually fight him.
[353:51.58]No, no, no.
[353:51.80]Stay right here.
[353:53.04]Just stay right here.
[353:53.68]He's going to do it right now.
[353:54.32]He's going to jump over it.
[353:54.96]He's going to fuck it up, and he's going to jump over it right now.
[353:56.55]Okay.
[354:00.23]There he goes.
[354:04.31]He's going to do a weird side jump, and he's going to go right down.
[354:11.89]I don't know why he fell off.
[354:13.03]His normal arena has places he can jump off.
[354:18.44]He's so pissed over over here.
[354:30.11]Actually not a bad space place for him to be.
[354:33.79]Oh, he almost did it.
[354:37.73]He actually almost did it.
[354:40.13]How does he know?
[355:05.43]Here he goes.
[355:05.99]That's a chunk.
[355:17.17]There he goes.
[355:17.59]He's dead.
[355:17.87]See you later.
[355:23.73]I see what happened.
[355:27.01]He does the jumps on the pillars and it's like he tried to jump to another pillar that didn't exist.
[355:32.21]It just did a Wile E. Coyote straight down.
[355:38.52]Nice.
[355:40.28]Cool.
[355:48.24]That's so bullshit.
[355:49.18]There shouldn't be ring outs.
[355:57.53]okay uh there is still an opportunity for this to go really wrong and if it's redan is there's only two more opportunities praying for a mad soldier he'll be on the horse too won't he that's gonna be a disaster oh yeah
[356:26.84]Just wait.
[356:27.28]It's going to be so anticlimactic.
[356:28.92]We're going to get an Erdtree Avatar and then an Erdtree Avatar.
[356:33.38]That's kind of... I really want it to just be like... You want to become the Elden Lord?
[356:41.99]Here's the one snail on the bridge.
[356:44.97]There is that snail, boss.
[356:46.15]Ah, we already beat that.
[357:03.28]Yeah, anybody voting right now, there is an equal chance here for it to be Redan, and we can't beat this for six hours, or Snail, and it's free.
[357:16.35]I remember this one should be two phases as well.
[357:18.45]Yep.
[357:25.64]Redan is easy.
[357:26.48]Not in the area we're about to go to.
[357:29.80]Also, when you say that statement, remember that we're both bad.
[357:34.26]Also very true.
[357:42.09]Be clean for this one.
[357:51.24]Alright.
[357:52.16]Bets are in.
[357:53.86]Should we take a peek or should we just walk in?
[357:55.24]Let's just walk in.
[357:59.72]Okay.
[358:03.83]Go.
[358:06.63]I got it first.
[358:08.31]Oh, he's huge.
[358:10.41]What?
[358:17.08]The Valiant Gargoyle.
[358:19.40]First Elden Lord.
[358:23.12]Wow, they give out Elden Lord to people wearing diapers?
[358:26.44]There is Elden Lord.
[358:27.52]Anybody can be Elden Lord, apparently.
[358:28.98]He doesn't even know we're here.
[358:31.84]Backstab him.
[358:32.48]Let's do stealth.
[358:34.34]When you jump, I'm going to unleash my katana.
[358:36.57]Ready?
[358:37.83]One, two, three.
[358:47.49]I'm dead.
[358:47.99]Holy shit.
[358:48.91]Dude, look at your health.
[358:51.01]Oh, my God.
[358:52.75]poisoned why did we get so annihilated because he's the first elven lord oh he is oh my god we just were talking so much I took so much damage so quickly I was trying I almost menued
[359:21.06]I'm trying to cure the poison and that's all I'm focused on.
[359:23.60]I gotta stop.
[359:26.46]Does he have Godfrey's Axe?
[359:27.90]Nah, nah.
[359:35.68]I think you can do it for the guild.
[359:42.19]You're doing a lot of damage to Swing.
[359:47.95]I have to clear this poison.
[359:55.73]You good?
[360:07.10]The hell is that?
[360:10.38]Oh, no.
[360:12.54]Oh, no.
[360:13.50]Oh, no.
[360:15.46]Oh, no.
[360:17.27]Oh, no.
[360:17.75]That can't be two.
[360:18.99]What do you mean?
[360:20.03]Valiant Gargoyle, first Elden Lord.
[360:22.33]Valiant Gargoyle, twin blade, first Elden Lord.
[360:26.54]That's not correct.
[360:30.00]It can't be two Elden Lords.
[360:34.66]Uh-oh.
[360:35.82]Okay.
[360:37.82]They're sharing the title?
[360:40.18]It's going to be three bosses.
[360:42.28]I think you could be the Elden Lord.
[360:44.14]No, you should be.
[360:49.59]This is going to be pretty rough.
[360:53.57]I don't think it's impossible, but if... Don't say it, but if Redan is phase two.
[360:58.93]I got to say, I'm impressed.
[361:01.05]The lore lines up.
[361:02.43]Seamless co-op, but we're going to be joint Elden Lords.
[361:07.41]Accurate.
[361:08.27]Like, yeah.
[361:08.97]Elden Lords are always couples, apparently.
[361:11.13]It's like a... It's weird.
[361:12.85]It's in the lore.
[361:14.31]I mean, you hold my hand and we run back up there.
[361:19.66]Did you not spawn here?
[361:21.42]Wait, why am I spawned all the way back?
[361:23.26]Did I not touch the bonfire?
[361:25.02]You might not have.
[361:29.50]The title makes it better.
[361:30.48]I'm already walking.
[361:34.89]Okay.
[361:35.57]Okay, well, as long as you don't insta-die.
[361:40.93]I mean, it was just... In fact, hold on.
[361:47.96]Do I even have any poison ballases?
[361:51.63]I don't.
[361:52.49]He said poison ballases.
[362:01.31]If we really, really focused the... If we do a big, big focus on the first one, damage, damage, damage, I think we'll be alright.
[362:11.32]Like, before he moved, we just, you know, he just did a lot of damage.
[362:16.48]Yeah.
[362:18.04]Alright, let's go for it.
[362:20.32]Let's go bucko.
[362:22.04]Oh.
[362:25.86]OK, let's sync it up again.
[362:28.95]Give this guy the business.
[362:34.63]Show him why he's washed up.
[362:37.40]Ready 123.
[362:55.41]Okay.
[362:56.11]When he hits half health.
[362:57.47]Yep.
[362:58.31]If we can both fight one, that would be ideal.
[363:00.98]He's going to co-op us, which is cheating.
[363:02.54]Alright.
[363:09.40]Here he comes.
[363:09.80]Oh, no.
[363:11.14]Oh, shit.
[363:11.46]Poison.
[363:12.12]Oh, shit.
[363:12.50]Poison.
[363:13.08]I'm poisoned.
[363:15.05]I'm fighting the other one.
[363:15.97]I have aggro.
[363:17.57]You just focus on him.
[363:34.60]Holy fuck.
[363:36.75]My guy is a tornado.
[363:40.35]Dude, I just don't know the move set.
[363:41.73]He's fucking destroying me.
[363:52.61]Fuck!
[363:53.13]Get at him!
[363:53.45]That poison does so much fuckin' damage, it's unbelievable.
[364:40.17]You can't be.
[364:40.96]Fuck you.
[364:44.12]Fuck you.
[364:48.30]Dude.
[364:48.82]He does this like huge jump backwards.
[364:54.84]I'm so slow.
[364:55.58]Okay.
[365:00.54]Tragic.
[365:03.29]We need to switch.
[365:05.18]I need the slower guy.
[365:05.98]I don't think the other one's slower.
[365:13.18]He is.
[365:13.44]Okay, well, I want to kill the one, and then I'll come help you.
[365:19.04]And then when I help you, your chat's going to be like, wow, Jerma's so good.
[365:23.55]I mean...
[365:25.88]It's not that I was doing poorly.
[365:26.98]It's just he would do a move and then he would jump backwards a hundred feet.
[365:31.52]And then I'd just chase after him.
[365:34.25]Put on better armor?
[365:35.23]Oh.
[365:37.11]You know what?
[365:37.55]Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
[365:43.73]Okay.
[365:43.93]Wait.
[365:44.03]Put anti-poison on your hotbar.
[365:47.25]I don't have any.
[365:49.11]Loser.
[365:50.89]Use a rune arc.
[365:53.63]Also a good idea.
[365:58.15]I don't think I even have anything equipped.
[366:09.01]With the Craigblade Ashivore?
[366:12.69]We'll see.
[366:13.17]I think we're alright.
[366:14.15]Just depends on what's after this.
[366:15.83]Here we go.
[366:29.32]That fucking poison is such shit.
[366:34.68]It's completely freezing.
[366:47.77]I'm going to grab the other one.
[366:50.81]I didn't get the stab.
[366:54.49]Double poison spray, bro.
[367:06.45]Find spring.
[367:07.23]I don't think it's coming to you.
[367:27.76]Oh, that's a double hit.
[367:31.79]Shit, he's moving around so... Fuck!
[367:42.31]Poison!
[368:19.48]Alright, who's next?
[368:20.52]Who's next?
[368:23.12]Who's next?
[368:30.71]It's alright.
[368:31.09]This is not horrible.
[368:31.95]This is phase one.
[368:32.83]Alright.
[368:33.57]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[368:47.53]Ow, you fuck.
[368:52.21]Ow.
[368:53.91]Fuck.
[368:55.21]It's alright.
[368:55.65]Just play safe.
[369:06.04]Nice.
[369:09.75]Get up, get up.
[369:11.81]He got fucking murdered.
[369:14.68]Tarnished.
[369:19.18]Thy strength befits a crown.
[369:23.02]I got a bunch of keys.
[369:28.12]Same palace key.
[369:29.56]I don't know what that all that's for.
[369:33.55]Well, here it is.
[369:35.21]Time for Mad Soldier Radon.
[369:39.40]True.
[369:43.86]Mad Soldier Radon.
[369:50.93]Could be... I mean, it could be... Radagon.
[369:56.19]But then, who's Elden Beast?
[369:58.43]It could be.
[370:04.05]I really do hope it's Soldier of Godrick.
[370:07.03]If it's Soldier of Godrick...
[370:09.61]That's a great thing.
[370:11.43]Let them vote.
[370:12.67]There's a lot of votes going on.
[370:15.07]I'm voting.
[370:16.71]Are you voting?
[370:17.61]I'm getting in on this.
[370:19.01]Remember, this is a two-phase fight.
[370:21.95]Yeah, but I think this is an easy W. I don't know.
[370:27.70]I'm all in.
[370:30.66]Wait, you all in channel points?

[372:44.40]It's Cobra Kai.
[372:48.10]It's the flashbang.
[372:49.02]I can't see.
[372:53.78]Look out!
[372:55.41]It's you!
[372:55.85]It's us!

[373:03.41]Which one's you?
[373:07.33]Wait, is it you or is it me?
[373:08.95]It's you on my screen.
[373:11.09]It's you on my screen.
[373:12.69]It's probably desyncing for us then.
[373:23.13]We're already in here.
[373:24.37]It was us the whole time.
[373:28.73]Man, the golden rule sucks.
[373:30.74]Yeah.
[373:31.38]But this world is shit.
[373:32.60]Who made the world this way?
[373:41.92]No, I want to be Elden Lord.
[373:43.42]No, I want to be Elden Lord.
[373:44.82]Okay.
[373:46.58]That was, man.
[373:47.86]So now what?
[373:49.92]I'm eating.
[373:55.53]Yep.
[373:58.01]Oh shit, it's the Ancestral Spirit!
[374:09.20]This sucks.
[374:14.31]Oh my god, he does a lot of damage.
[374:16.21]He does a lot.
[374:17.03]No, a lot.
[374:18.13]Like actually, like an unbelievable amount.
[374:20.17]He scaled to be the Elden Beast.
[374:26.81]Fuck just like the Elden Beast You're gonna run Oh right in the head
[375:03.77]He's gonna heal.
[375:05.59]Wait, there's no animals in here.
[375:07.21]No, there's no animals.
[375:08.54]I think this is the, like, lesser version, by the way.
[375:12.58]Yeah, because it's all, like, bloody.
[375:31.11]Get over here.
[375:41.14]He's going wild.
[375:45.30]Uh-oh.
[375:52.04]Just top me off.
[375:56.81]Imagine voting no.
[375:58.83]Everyone gets mimicked.
[376:01.31]Yeah, I would put my hand through my monitor.
[376:06.79]Well, at least phase two is going to get him.
[376:14.07]But the music too is perfect.
[376:22.20]Stop doing that.
[376:23.04]He really just wants the stream to keep going.
[376:29.45]Oh, come on.
[376:29.79]They're going to end if I die.
[376:41.30]God damn it.
[376:41.92]He's so like wiggly.
[377:04.07]By the way, the person that gets the last hit is the Elden Lord.
[377:06.19]That's how it works.
[377:11.09]Shit!
[377:12.23]Oh, he's so far away.
[377:13.83]I got robbed.
[377:19.82]No!
[377:22.58]Elden Lord!
[377:25.56]Bow.
[377:32.22]Yes, my lord.
[377:34.18]as my first rule put on these cat ears it's rubber touches it god damn it he just he he gets to make all the rules now you put on the cat ears I was born for this
[378:04.45]That's the worst day for doubters.
[378:07.29]You had a pretty good chance, I'll be honest.
[378:10.29]Radan still in the mix.
[378:12.86]Radagon still in the mix.
[378:13.76]My voice is just gone.
[378:15.22]He's in the mix.
[378:16.30]Have we just been screaming for like six hours?
[378:20.12]Yeah.
[378:20.26]We've been saying a lot of weird stuff.
[378:23.38]Maybe a dragon too.
[378:25.32]A dragon in that first area would have been pretty terrible.
[378:31.92]What ending did we even get?
[378:36.63]I don't know.
[378:38.19]We didn't do anything.
[378:46.65]Trying to put the head in the cup.
[378:49.56]You're not bowing.
[378:50.22]You're like, I don't know.
[379:00.94]The fallen leaves tell a story.
[379:09.20]That vote must have been like more than 50% assuming we would lose.
[379:20.97]No, it was.
[379:21.93]It was 26 million versus 31 million.
[379:24.03]31 was no.
[379:24.95]A lot of people lost points right there.
[379:29.99]That's 31 million points gone from whoever had them.
[379:36.49]an age of fracture Mimic Tear it's like that's probably underneath Soldier of Godrick that secret ending
[380:04.17]What?
[380:05.03]Wait.
[380:06.53]What?
[380:11.21]Oh, we died.
[380:11.95]I guess we died.
[380:14.55]That's half a million souls gone, by the way.
[380:20.42]Unfortunate.
[380:21.16]Oh, that's not good.
[380:24.02]Alright.
[380:25.46]I was going to change the world.
[380:26.70]I became Elden Lord and then I accidentally no-clipped through the Earth.
[380:32.75]All that power, I don't know what to do with it.
[380:42.45]Let's respec our build one last time.
[380:44.43]You know, actually, you know what we can do?
[380:46.73]Can we actually go and do the Thea boss?
[380:49.35]Might as well.
[380:53.06]I guess.
[380:54.12]Right?
[380:55.26]I guess.
[380:58.18]Now do PvP.
[381:05.59]pvp for true elden lord I don't know how we how do we would we even fight each other the same way that we did it accidentally before okay but then don't don't we have like a third party uh my guy what is my guy doing I don't know are you controlling him your character no no I pressed b be held and I just started walking at her but then I missed because you like walked in front of her I wanted to be held
[381:35.71]Let me be held.
[381:38.71]No.
[381:39.37]I'm, I'm getting, I'm getting in there.
[381:41.95]Let me in this.
[381:42.84]Let me in here.
[381:43.56]Please.
[381:44.36]Let me in here.
[381:46.44]This is so weird.
[381:48.42]Mommy.
[381:49.20]Fuck.
[381:51.06]This is weird.
[381:59.14]I didn't do anything.
[382:15.44]OK.
[382:19.63]We're missing the item.
[382:20.45]Oh my God, when you hit her, she bursts.
[382:29.17]A week broken in this mod.
[382:35.05]Owned.
[382:39.60]Alright, well then you got what you want it.
[382:41.54]We don't have to play anymore.
[382:43.36]Hey, that's not what I said.
[382:45.10]It's over forever.
[382:46.84]Hey.
[382:49.60]It's not goodbye.
[382:51.22]It's I'll see you in a few years.
[382:56.09]Maybe.
[382:56.43]Alright.
[382:56.75]2025.
[382:57.33]Is there anything you want to clean up before you want to go?
[383:06.36]How do you feel?
[383:11.20]Nah, I mean, you can't really just go backwards after you kill the Mimic tier Elden Lord.
[383:16.90]That's true.
[383:17.84]The only thing we would find was Redan, wherever Redan was.
[383:21.28]Or Radagon.
[383:24.72]Which is probably Nokron.
[383:26.70]If we went to go fight Moog, I feel like that would be Redan.
[383:29.98]And that would be a shit fight if it was like both of them.
[383:33.27]Because it seemed to be putting the strong bosses in strong boss places.
[383:38.65]True.
[383:39.47]That's the true ending fight.
[383:42.23]Well, that was really fun.
[383:44.56]That was actually a really good time and a pleasure.
[383:48.58]All good things come to an end.
[383:50.70]All art must be finite.
[383:53.10]Yeah.
[383:54.52]Let Nexon publish Elden Ring Online.
[384:02.81]That was fun.
[384:04.59]uh that was the seamless co-op uh seamless co-op works pretty flawlessly uh we the only problems we had were very very just minor basic very very easy to fix problems like oh uh my game crashed once every few hours or something it's really not a big deal there were really like none today too so it was really smooth
[384:28.05]As mod makers, give a round of applause.
[384:33.67]Without the person who made this mod, we can't do seamless co-op like this.
[384:39.80]It goes for anybody.
[384:42.30]Yeah.
[384:45.46]Ball joke ending?
[384:46.18]Yeah, it was perfect.
[384:48.38]Alright, dude.
[384:50.02]Hey, what are you up to in like a week or two?
[384:51.82]Whatever.
[384:52.14]You want to play something else?
[384:54.34]I don't know.
[384:54.72]We'll figure something out if you want to play something again.
[384:56.70]We'll always figure something out.

[385:13.20]I don't think it's for me.
[385:22.02]They're never going to talk again.
[385:23.26]Hey, that's not true.

[386:04.79]Yeah, it was just randomizer and seamless co-op.
[386:11.41]Oh, we forgot about the typing test.
[386:12.99]Don't worry.
[386:13.37]We'll do it.
