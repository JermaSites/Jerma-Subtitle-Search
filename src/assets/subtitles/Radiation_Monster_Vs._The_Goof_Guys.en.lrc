[00:08.69]So why can't I say names?
[00:09.81]I thought there were like 50 characters in this game.
[00:12.61]I don't know.
[00:12.99]I thought so too, but apparently there's only four.
[00:15.76]Oh, well.
[00:18.34]Alright.
[00:20.20]Which map are we on?
[00:21.08]There's 20 characters in the game.
[00:22.70]Just go to a random location.
[00:23.80]It doesn't really fucking matter.
[00:25.22]Like, let's just play the game.
[00:27.29]Alright, let's go.
[00:28.79]Oh, look out.
[00:29.65]It's a spooky statue.
[00:32.70]Okay.
[00:33.04]So, Jerma is the red vest.
[00:35.74]I hear static.
[00:36.41]Yeah.
[00:36.91]There's a... Tape.
[00:37.99]Tape.
[00:39.21]Get that tape.
[00:39.73]Oh, we got it.
[00:43.91]Is that something back there?
[00:45.53]Can you guys see that?
[00:46.57]No, that's just like a tree.
[00:48.95]So the closer you get to the cassette tapes, they start buzzing and making noise and stuff, so you can find them.
[00:53.75]I feel like stealth.
[00:54.35]Is this you?
[00:54.76]This looks like you.
[00:56.92]That's not me.
[00:57.60]That's Alex.
[00:58.52]That looks like bizarro MLC stealth.
[01:01.18]Turn around!
[01:02.42]Turn around!
[01:03.22]Run!
[01:03.54]Run!
[01:03.82]Run!
[01:04.14]He's right behind us!
[01:05.08]He's literally right behind us!
[01:05.92]He's a giant monster!
[01:06.62]Run!
[01:06.92]Jesus Christ!
[01:07.92]He's gone.
[01:10.88]What do you mean he's gone?
[01:11.58]What happens if you look at him?
[01:14.08]Is he gone?
[01:15.10]It's not good.
[01:17.03]Where'd he go?
[01:17.45]I don't know.
[01:18.61]Why are we all acting so nonchalant about this, by the way?
[01:22.79]Is it not running?
[01:24.77]You'll never catch me.
[01:26.83]Yeah, that's not running.
[01:27.99]Are you guys all running?
[01:30.01]I'm sprinting.
[01:30.83]Everybody sprint right now.
[01:32.11]I want to watch people sprint.
[01:33.81]That's a sprint?
[01:35.84]Okay, guys, let me sprint away, except it's just walking.
[01:39.42]Oh!
[01:40.04]Fuck!
[01:41.10]What?
[01:41.49]Where is he?
[01:41.83]Oh!
[01:41.91]He's like right next to us!
[01:43.78]What?
[01:44.06]Where?
[01:45.19]Oh, he really is.
[01:46.11]He's right there.
[01:47.77]This guy's a fucking chump.
[01:49.07]You know what?
[01:49.57]Where is he?
[01:51.57]Where's, like, the attack button?
[01:54.80]I'm telling you right now, I'm gonna punch this guy right in his face.
[01:59.12]He's not here anymore.
[02:00.40]Oh no, I lost everybody.
[02:02.00]Oh no, I didn't.
[02:03.32]You guys are, like, right next to me.
[02:04.75]No.
[02:09.85]This guy is a... That guy's a wuss.
[02:12.03]Are you serious?
[02:12.79]That's like... It was scary for two seconds.
[02:14.67]He just stands there and stares at you.
[02:16.23]He really doesn't stand there.
[02:17.49]He just goes like this.
[02:20.68]What has it been?
[02:21.82]Am I staring at him?
[02:23.06]Why is my guy freaking out?
[02:24.96]What's that green thing?
[02:25.60]Is that a monster?
[02:26.06]I think if you sprint too much, you get scared easier.
[02:27.95]It's that green thing that apparently I don't like looking at.
[02:31.17]Why?
[02:31.43]What's the problem?
[02:32.67]I don't know.
[02:33.11]He's behind us.
[02:34.41]He's behind us.
[02:34.99]He's behind us too.
[02:36.15]He's behind us.
[02:37.19]I don't know where to go.
[02:37.85]I'm going this way.
[02:39.07]Let's go to the green thing.
[02:40.45]Somebody go to the green thing.
[02:41.16]Dude, the green thing is making us all screwed up.
[02:43.02]I'm not walking to the green thing.
[02:44.38]It's like a just big ball of radiation or something.
[02:46.76]I know, why is this thing like emitting radiation?
[02:49.30]What happens if I touch it?
[02:49.98]Is anybody close to me right now?
[02:51.40]Okay, I'm like next to you.
[02:53.82]I'm like... I'm screaming!
[02:57.80]Where did Drupal go?
[02:59.92]We lost him!
[03:00.66]I'm dead!
[03:02.36]We lost Drupal!
[03:04.39]Dude, I went to the radiation thing and he like popped up in my fucking face!
[03:09.85]Can you watch this or what's happening?
[03:11.83]Where am I?
[03:12.49]Oh, I'm a ghost.
[03:13.09]Can you guys see me?
[03:14.65]No!
[03:14.77]He's a ghost!
[03:15.39]Dude, I swear to god, I'm a ghost!
[03:16.83]Is somebody inside of this thing?
[03:19.91]Oh, I see you.
[03:20.79]Yeah, I see you.
[03:21.29]I'm gonna come attack you guys.
[03:22.27]That's why I think I have to come kill you guys now.

[03:25.09]Oh, it's a ghost!

[03:31.54]You look scary.
[03:32.36]No, you can't hurt me.
[03:34.56]So what do I do?
[03:35.12]Just stick around with you guys?

[03:37.40]Apparently, Mike is very tired.
[03:44.72]And his flashlight is flicker- her flashlight's flickering.
[03:48.00]This rock formation looks like a genie.

[03:51.69]Somebody give him the middle finger.
[04:00.20]But the monster's right to the left.
[04:02.10]Do not go to the green radiation rock.
[04:04.06]I thought it was like a super magic powers like I was gonna get like flight or something if I touched it.
