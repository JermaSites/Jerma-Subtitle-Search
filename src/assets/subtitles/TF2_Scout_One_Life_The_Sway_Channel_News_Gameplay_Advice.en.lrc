[00:08.82]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.46]Jirba here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:14.49]And tonight, I'm going to be playing as the Scout with the default Scouter gun, the Bach Atomic Punch, and the Candy Cane.
[00:21.59]I don't think I ever take the Candy Cane off, ever.
[00:23.89]So, just pretty much every Scout game from now on, just assume the Candy Cane is just always on, because I'd love it too much to take it off.
[00:30.99]But anyways, this is a one-life gameplay on CTF Double Cross.
[00:34.71]I get a lot of requests to do more CTF, and this is fulfilling that request, hopefully.
[00:39.59]CTF Double Cross is a little bit of a turtle stalemate map, just like something like 2-4, where all the engineers just build in the flag room, and unless you get an uber-charge or you get a scout coming in like me with the bonk, it's almost impossible to get the intelligence.
[00:55.66]So it really just becomes a TDM this whole game.
[00:58.60]But it ends kind of tragically.
[01:00.40]I kill 16 people in this one life, and it ends very tragically.
[01:03.93]I just, you'll see what happens.
[01:05.57]But anyways, I want to talk about a couple things before the video gets started.
[01:07.91]We're going to talk about some things about the gameplay.
[01:09.53]We're going to talk about the... I'm talking really fast right now.
[01:12.13]Let me slow down.
[01:13.49]We're going to talk about a couple of channel updates, and most notably, how to analyze yourself, and how I've done it in this gameplay with the scouts.
[01:22.26]Kind of some scout tips and some scout strategies.
[01:25.66]let's start with one thing the unusual hat winner has been selected so and that has been given to him or her I'm not sure if it was a he or she but they got the hat and yeah congratulations to the winner if you didn't win the hat I am sorry but as you know what this channel I always do stuff like that so you'll always have a chance next time when I do another one of those giveaways and secondly
[01:48.68]I'm going to bring back Scare Saturdays.
[01:51.20]I've gotten such an overwhelming response to bring that back.
[01:55.68]Last video, it was a top comment with like a hundred and something thumbs up.
[01:59.36]I get the question all the time in PMs, bring back Scare Saturdays.
[02:02.90]So, I'm gonna do that.
[02:04.78]This Saturday, I'm gonna bring it back, and I want you guys to vote on the game you want me to play.
[02:10.15]So, in the description of this video, is gonna do, is gonna be a poll there,
[02:14.97]with a bunch of scary games, some that I've already played, some that I maybe have not played, but still pick one of those and that's what's going to be there for Scare Saturdays.
[02:23.77]You can only vote one time, so make your vote count, baby.
[02:27.58]And it does need to be noted about Scare Saturdays that I'm not going to be doing any more Let's Plays of horror games.
[02:33.34]I know I did Nightmare House 2, I did the whole thing.
[02:35.76]It's on the channel if you want to go look for it, you can just search for it.
[02:38.58]Also, I also tried to do Gray, but I don't know, Let's Plays in me don't really work that well anymore, unless it's a
[02:44.99]short kind of a three to four hour long game if it's like a 10 hour long experience or like a 20 hour long campaign like something I don't know how long dead space 3 is but what I would do with something like dead space if somebody if you guys voted for it would be a highlight reel of scares or a highlight reel of like funny moments uh during that particular playthrough I did so it would just end up being me scaring the crap out of myself not a 75 episode let's play
[03:09.71]But now that that is out of the way, hopefully a lot of you guys go vote on that poll.
[03:13.81]But let's start talking about the Scout.
[03:16.35]So, I don't know if you noticed in this gameplay, and it's something somebody actually brought this up a long time ago about how I play Scout.
[03:23.30]And I made a tip video about Scout addressing this sort of, but watching this gameplay back is how I really realize how much I do it.
[03:30.90]And I'm gonna call it the sway.
[03:32.82]That's what I'm gonna call it.
[03:33.54]The sway back and forth when I'm shooting people and trying to get good meat shots on people.
[03:39.07]What I'm talking about here is, you'll see it, I go like, almost like I'm sweeping the screen, not with my mouse, but with my A and D keys.
[03:48.01]And it's something, I don't know why I do this.
[03:49.98]And I think it's because I have a lot of trouble aiming with the mouse, more so than I do with just kind of getting people in front of my crosshair.
[03:56.74]But I kill every single person almost by doing the sway, in quotes.
[04:01.38]And if you're having trouble with the scout, try doing this.
[04:04.57]Because I'm not very good at Twitch aiming, I'm not that great at like, whipping around and like, shoot,
[04:09.51]Like some of you guys are.
[04:10.51]Some of you guys are unbelievable at this game, and especially at Scout in particular.
[04:15.07]But if you're having trouble with your aim as a Scout or with your tactics as a Scout, try to implement the sway.
[04:21.48]And actually, like I said, you guys brought this up.
[04:24.16]I didn't even know I was doing this.
[04:25.36]This is completely subconscious to me.
[04:27.52]And I do this with the Engineer, with the shotguns.
[04:29.98]I do this with the Pyro shotguns.
[04:31.70]And I do it with the Scout.
[04:33.02]So it's become very evident, especially, like I said, watching this gameplay back.
[04:36.69]I'm like, oh my god, I do it every kill.
[04:39.79]And it actually brings me to the second point of this video, and it's a pretty simple one.
[04:44.03]Try recording yourself.
[04:45.57]Try to record yourself and see what you do in all these different situations you're in.
[04:50.38]It can really help you analyze your gameplay, find out what you're doing wrong, find out what you're doing right.
[04:56.94]and make yourself a better player because of it.
[04:58.86]It's very much the same as, I don't know if you guys have ever done this before, but I do it all the time, looking into the mirror in the bathroom and smiling or making faces to know what you look like in real life.
[05:10.85]Same thing, when I do these facecam videos and I do like vlogs, I watch the videos back and I go, oh, that's what I do when I like laugh.
[05:18.22]It's analyzing yourself
[05:20.28]to know where your flaws are, and know where your strengths are, and you can only do that by real self-analyzation.
[05:26.84]Self-analyzation, I do not think is a word, but we made it up right now for this video.
[05:30.52]But anyways, guys, that's gonna wrap it up here.
[05:32.80]At the end, you see, I don't get the intelligence.
[05:35.55]It's sitting right on the edge, and I was trying to run in there and grab it.
[05:38.49]Pretty tragic, I know.
[05:39.95]But that's gonna wrap it up here, guys.
[05:41.63]I'll see you guys all next time.
[05:42.67]Thank you, everybody, for watching, and of course, take care, everybody.
