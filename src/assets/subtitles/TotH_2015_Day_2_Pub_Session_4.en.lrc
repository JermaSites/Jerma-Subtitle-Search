[ve:61.1.100]

[00:01.96]Alright, everybody, welcome back to the Tip of the Hats 2015.
[00:06.38]We are here live in our Ignite studio raising money for the One Step Camp located here in Chicago.
[00:12.72]I am Bloodsire.
[00:13.48]Joining me on the couch, we have Tag and Mala.
[00:16.62]We are going to get ready with our pub segment.
[00:19.81]Over on the Gamer Table, we are joined with Truck Truck and Mela, and we have a special Jerma and Star segment here for you guys.
[00:29.70]Of course, 100% of all donations will be going to One Step Camp, so we thank you for tuning in today, for opening up your hearts, for opening up your wallets, and being with here.
[00:39.42]Star and Jerma, are you guys there and ready to go?
[00:41.40]We are in the pub.
[00:43.88]We're ready to rock and roll.
[00:45.61]Hey.
[00:46.73]Hi.
[00:47.25]Hey, it's the whole friend team.
[00:49.38]Hey, Ster.
[00:50.54]Hey, how's it going?
[00:52.78]Tag, yeah.
[00:55.34]Get out of here, please.
[00:57.63]Please leave.
[01:00.89]Coordinating some friend fun time shenanigans.
[01:03.13]If you haven't noticed, there's some friends here.
[01:05.10]We're all huntsmaning.
[01:06.62]We're all friends here.
[01:07.86]We're split up, though.
[01:09.20]You and Mail are on the other team.
[01:11.51]Well, yep.
[01:13.80]Our game also crashed on the camera.
[01:16.85]Did our server crash?
[01:17.59]Did it go down?
[01:18.11]Well, our game camera crashed.
[01:20.90]That's alright.
[01:21.66]So why don't you guys give us the radio cast of what's going on there?
[01:24.40]Yeah, you guys need to tell us what's going on.
[01:25.99]He pulls back the arrow.
[01:27.09]He shoots the arrow.
[01:27.91]He pulls back the arrow.
[01:29.23]He shoots the arrow.
[01:30.79]Waits for someone to walk in front of it.
[01:32.53]It's just a typical, typical day on a Team Fortress 2 server, you know.
[01:37.62]Oh, we're back.
[01:39.88]We can see, but if you guys want to continue on with this fine radiocast, I'm all for it.
[01:44.14]Alright, well, we got, um, some very important things going on.
[01:50.11]See, this is on upward.
[01:51.86]This is the hide map.
[01:53.16]This is the, wow.
[01:55.10]This is the map where you hide as Huntsman and everyone just plays peek-a-boo with each other until you get hit in the head.
[02:01.30]I think this is how the Highlander meta would evolve if all classes were allowed and, you know, you just have all snipers.
[02:08.66]You're pretty much playing pop-up book of the game where everyone has their own tab that you pull and then they appear.
[02:16.67]It really is kind of like that.
[02:18.65]Peak, corner, miss.
[02:20.23]Peak, corner.
[02:22.07]There's just one guy with the direction.
[02:24.62]Peak, corner, die.
[02:26.68]I mean, some people are better at peeking corners.
[02:28.54]I'm on an eight streak over here.
[02:31.30]Yeah, well, before the stream turned on, I was on a 10th street.
[02:36.46]Oh, just before anyone knew.
[02:41.35]Before we could see.
[02:44.21]He's unstoppable.
[02:45.84]Dude, come on.
[02:48.54]I was gonna melee get you.
[02:50.70]I think this is just too good for anyone to watch.
[02:54.19]No, we got the cam.
[02:56.69]Yep, we got the cam.
[02:57.53]Yeah, we're good.
[02:58.15]Get your canvas ready.
[02:58.87]It's on you, Star.
[02:59.73]I'm stealing that.
[03:03.21]Got him!
[03:03.71]Got him!
[03:05.81]Keep that camera on him, because he's about to... Please acknowledge the one or two people on Soldier who really, really, really want to win for the kids.
[03:16.11]I see him.
[03:16.75]I see him.
[03:17.73]Oh, like... Yeah, 10 kills in a row streamed.
[03:19.51]Hi, guys.
[03:21.19]Demo.
[03:21.35]A demo?
[03:22.25]Yeah, I'm here.
[03:26.16]We're about to win the game.
[03:28.28]No, you know, I don't want to cap that yet.
[03:29.72]I got some business to take care of in here.
[03:34.07]I'm waiting for the one person to come out this side door.
[03:41.05]There he is.
[03:42.11]We got Stabby Stabby in here.
[03:43.77]He just joined up.
[03:46.50]You can get the frag.
[03:47.30]What are you doing?
[03:47.90]What are you doing?
[03:48.78]What are you doing?
[03:50.44]Just coming out.
[03:55.13]After a second I thought you were just like on auto walk or something.
[03:59.40]He was just walking towards me.
[04:00.81]I wanted to taunt kill you.
[04:01.57]I thought you were going to do something dumb and try and melee me.
[04:04.23]Like, why is he running at me?
[04:05.69]No, you freaked me out.
[04:06.95]You were doing, like, odd things, and I didn't understand what was happening.
[04:10.94]Alright, you know, that's fun and all, but what you really go in a pub to do is try your heart out and show off your hats.
[04:20.71]So, I mean, why are we all on Huntsman?
[04:22.73]Nobody has professional Huntsmans.
[04:24.97]What's the point?
[04:26.29]Can you not do that?
[04:28.63]I mean, mine's professional.
[04:32.90]I want to get one of those.
[04:34.00]A donation from Mojo the Kid.
[04:35.86]$50 saying, hey, loving the stream.
[04:39.15]You're doing a good thing, so keep it up.
[04:41.37]Can't wait to see how big Toth will get by this time next year.
[04:45.00]Hope this donation helps.
[04:45.98]Tell Senpai and Fanny I said hi.
[04:49.18]We'll track them down and let you know.
[04:52.99]We'll find them.
[04:56.46]I want to play a different class, but then it's like, you're that guy.
[05:00.04]Like, who will do it first?
[05:01.20]Like, when is this all going to fall apart?
[05:03.07]Medic.
[05:03.35]Everyone's going medic.
[05:03.99]We're doing all medic.
[05:06.19]Every single medic.
[05:07.17]Too late.
[05:10.12]Red team's going to build.
[05:14.68]Where are you?
[05:15.78]Wait, are you on the other team?
[05:16.72]Am I not on the front team?
[05:17.83]Jerma, me and you.
[05:18.53]Where are you?
[05:19.80]Male is the only one that's not on the friend team.
[05:26.06]We only need two more subscribers to the Tip of the Hatch channel and then we get Toth Potato and Toth Spy Crab emotes.
[05:32.98]That sounds interesting.
[05:33.92]Can I take one guess at what Toth Potato is?
[05:39.08]What do you guys think Toth Potato would be?
[05:40.95]You're going to have to sub to see.
[05:42.37]How many emotes do we have so far?
[05:44.21]We've got a lot.
[05:45.39]I don't know how to count, so I'm not really sure.
[05:47.76]One, two, three.
[05:49.94]What is that thing?
[05:50.74]One Marshmallow, two Marshmallow, three Marshmallow.
[05:55.01]I think we got some.
[05:57.47]Maybe if we get those two subs, I don't know.
[06:00.52]We're going to bait them out.
[06:01.64]Who's going first?
[06:02.90]No, I'm going first.
[06:03.54]You have the crits.
[06:04.52]No, I want to go first.
[06:05.85]No, I don't have it built yet.
[06:07.31]Alright, you go first.
[06:09.15]Okay, let's go first.
[06:11.01]Go!
[06:14.15]Why are you using that?
[06:15.15]Use your... your arm swinger.
[06:17.94]Here comes the arm swing.
[06:22.48]Oh, good job.
[06:23.60]Great work.
[06:23.90]Oh, yeah, go use your arm swing.
[06:25.45]Okay.
[06:25.77]Look at me.
[06:26.41]I'm doing my arm swing, and I'm getting kills all over the place.
[06:28.97]Where have you been?
[06:29.91]Do you know who you are?
[06:32.62]Who?
[06:32.98]You are James Madison.
[06:34.60]You know why?
[06:35.58]Why?
[06:36.56]What did James Madison ever do?
[06:37.57]You know, he was the shortest president.
[06:39.05]You're just a short, insignificant little man.
[06:42.31]Tallest president.
[06:43.09]You want to know who I am?
[06:44.53]It's rude, honestly.
[06:45.77]Hey, guess how tall Benjamin Franklin was.
[06:48.75]Dude, Benjamin Franklin was like three foot.
[06:50.27]Take a wild guess.
[06:51.15]Yeah.
[06:53.24]Was Benjamin Franklin a short, insignificant man?
[06:55.86]What did Benjamin Franklin do?
[06:57.04]Name one thing.
[07:00.95]Okay.
[07:01.67]Name one.
[07:02.53]Do it.
[07:03.01]Okay.
[07:03.51]Benjamin Franklin discovered electricity with his pipe.
[07:07.72]And guess what?
[07:08.26]Just kidding.
[07:08.72]That never happened.
[07:09.42]That's actually made up in your history book.
[07:10.86]So what did he do?
[07:11.30]He never did that.
[07:12.48]So what did he do?
[07:13.86]He...
[07:17.75]We got one sub.
[07:19.25]Hold on just a second.
[07:20.82]Coming from the person who's going to have Benjamin Franklin up on his wall.
[07:23.44]Oh, someone's typing in Google.
[07:24.94]I just need to... Oh, we got another sub.
[07:27.24]I think we're good.
[07:28.81]I think we just unlocked the new two subscriber emotes.
[07:33.25]So now I'm just looking at chat.
[07:34.61]I want to see what this tough potato might be.
[07:37.70]Okay, what did Benjamin Franklin even do?
[07:40.28]Enter.
[07:41.47]You know, is anyone else obviously just bored with Benjamin Franklin?
[07:44.83]I think he designed the $100 bill, if I'm not mistaken.
[07:49.10]Why?
[07:49.50]Why did he deserve that?
[07:50.46]Why is he the most important bill?
[07:51.86]The guy came up with the wave theory.
[07:54.35]Are you kidding me?
[07:55.53]He was a scientist.
[07:56.65]He was a philanthropist.
[07:59.59]He came up with, like, temperature.
[08:00.99]He was a guy that came up with, like, temperatures and stuff.
[08:02.93]He came up with temperature.
[08:03.85]I don't buy that for a second.
[08:04.92]Oil on water?
[08:05.20]He figured it out.
[08:05.86]Benjamin Franklin figured out oil doesn't work with water.
[08:08.97]He spilled a cup.
[08:10.53]Like, what do you want from me?
[08:11.49]He invented chess?
[08:12.63]Are you kidding me?
[08:13.63]He invented chess?
[08:14.34]Yeah, he came up with all kinds of studies.
[08:18.56]He was an author.
[08:20.21]How dare you say anything bad.
[08:22.23]You know who has like a book?
[08:23.80]Everyone.
[08:25.19]Like Donald Trump should be on the $100 bill.
[08:27.45]He probably has like eight books.
[08:29.62]I'm just not buying it.
[08:32.05]Alright, guys, all auctions have been added to the Steam group, including the Star and Jerma auctions.
[08:38.12]You can check out the Tip of the Hat Steam group in the Discussions tab if you want to see those auctions.
[08:42.42]Ooh, that sounds interesting.
[08:43.69]I feel like this is, like, last Tip of the Hats or maybe the first one where I tried to bid on my own sniper rifle and everyone else made me feel bad.
[08:53.28]I am sad I gave away that pistol.
[08:55.34]to be honest.
[08:55.94]Factory new.
[08:57.22]Unusual.
[08:58.08]Oh, really?
[08:59.43]How many of those have you seen?
[09:01.29]And I didn't even get to use it.
[09:03.89]I had it for like three days and I put it in a box.
[09:05.89]So like what you're saying is you're going to have to bid on it then.
[09:07.92]I'm going to have to bid on it.
[09:08.84]Is that your golden pan like equivalent?
[09:12.24]Pretty much.
[09:14.16]It's for the kids though.
[09:15.16]Multi-class item.
[09:16.65]Multi-class item.
[09:17.49]You want to play engineer?
[09:18.37]Go ahead.
[09:18.79]I don't know why you would.
[09:20.61]But I mean you can play it on scout too.
[09:22.07]So it doesn't even matter.
[09:25.02]Well, that's cool.
[09:28.77]That's really cool.
[09:30.01]You just said that all you have is a jock shocker?
[09:32.61]Not even unusual, dude.
[09:35.64]Look at Jemma's donation.
[09:37.32]Yeah, mine is the shock jock.
[09:40.49]It's a strange factory new shell shocker.
[09:42.99]Perfect name.
[09:45.61]What's the effect on it?
[09:46.52]Jock shocks?
[09:48.14]Speaking of donations, we have just lost the $165,000 threshold.
[09:54.89]We have a $50 donation from Tiny Sprite saying all of them beam hugs.
[10:01.18]Heart.
[10:02.06]Heart to you.
[10:02.74]Thank you for your donation.
[10:04.23]Thank you, guys, everybody who's watching.
[10:05.83]Thanks a lot.
[10:09.15]Yeah, I don't think we've been really, at least on like the pubs, me or Star or any of us, I can't believe that it's already that high.
[10:20.07]It's amazing.
[10:21.17]It's possible.
[10:21.69]It could get like 200 plus.
[10:24.56]The 200k.
[10:26.18]We'd have to do something pretty incredible for 200,000.
[10:28.76]Yeah.
[10:29.10]That's double.
[10:29.54]You gotta think of it.
[10:31.27]I was worried this year that we wouldn't, like, we'd, like, get 100,000 again and be like, ah, I guess we didn't, like, grow as a community.
[10:39.20]We didn't earn more money this year than last year.
[10:42.72]But we have.
[10:43.84]But no, but we have.
[10:44.94]I mean, I'm pretty blown away by it.
[10:47.72]Especially on the first day, like even before the stream started.
[10:50.87]Absolutely outstanding that we were able to reach $30,000 before the stream ever started.
[10:55.89]And of course, we've crushed last year's goal.
[10:58.90]And like you said, if we can get to that 200k, all of those proceeds will be going to One Step Camp.
[11:04.54]So it's a great cause and it's great that you guys can be here helping us achieve that for the children.
[11:10.83]That gets 200 kids to camp.
[11:12.85]$200,000.
[11:15.15]How many kids actually go to each full camp?
[11:19.86]How many attend?
[11:21.18]For the summer camp, I think they had about 140.
[11:24.18]There's two sessions, two weeks.
[11:26.55]Some kids go for both weeks.
[11:27.75]Some kids just go for one week or the second week.
[11:29.99]But there's a lot of kids there.
[11:32.27]They come back year after year.
[11:33.43]They just love it.
[11:34.93]So that's potentially covering every single kid, huh?
[11:38.39]Yeah.
[11:38.95]But there's other programs, too.
[11:40.19]They do dude ranch, they do winter camp, they do skiing.
[11:45.62]I mean, there's just so many programs for these kids.
[11:47.68]There's sibling camp, there's family camp, brain tumor camp.
[11:52.13]So it's not just the summer camp.
[11:54.17]It goes to all of these things.
[11:56.31]Well, hopefully we can get as much money raised as possible, so then... Yeah, absolutely.
[11:59.73]Send them to multiple things.
[12:01.22]Yep.
[12:02.24]So, Star and Jerma,
[12:04.80]I have a question for you, too.
[12:06.82]Yeah, what's the question tag?
[12:08.60]What is a... I'm glad you guys got the joke.
[12:15.83]It wasn't even a joke.
[12:16.94]You just, like, that was... It was my tag impression.
[12:19.74]I'm just actually curious.
[12:22.69]What is a jock shocker?
[12:25.23]Do you really want to know the answer to that question?
[12:27.91]Do I want to?
[12:28.51]I don't know.
[12:29.07]I don't know if you want to know.
[12:30.46]I don't know what it is.
[12:31.10]Traditionally, it would just be a Crypt's Creed.
[12:33.40]Oh.
[12:34.36]The new jock shocker, we didn't even know at the time, the gunmetal update, there's the lightning items.
[12:40.20]Those are now the jock shockers.
[12:41.95]And there's an item called the shell shocker.
[12:45.17]Ah.
[12:45.63]This is getting really deep.
[12:47.01]Yeah.
[12:48.31]It's pretty much just, it has multiple meanings.
[12:51.15]It needs to be stopped.
[12:53.62]It's like then and then.
[12:55.22]Aww.
[12:57.83]Thank you very much, dude.
[13:13.21]Oh, never mind.
[13:15.05]I know how Upward works.
[13:16.57]Last year I was thinking, I donated some money, and I was really thinking to myself, a year from now, I'm not going to even know or remember what I would have actually spent that money on.
[13:27.66]But if I donated it, somebody would definitely remember that camp for the rest of their life.
[13:34.29]So that's the justification I figured there.
[13:37.90]That's great.
[13:39.50]Yeah, I haven't donated any money yet.
[13:41.70]I'm trying to find the best possible way for me to do it because I'd like to donate.
[13:47.71]I donated last year and the year before that.
[13:50.63]I wiped out my bank account this last month.
[13:53.75]There was contractors here that I had to pay, and I'm like, alright, yeah, let me pay you.
[13:58.54]Oh, okay, where can I find some money?
[14:02.10]I should be donating some money in the next couple hours or so.
[14:05.92]That's great.
[14:08.95]contractors.
[14:10.89]Of course, every little bit helps, no matter what it is, whether it's a dollar donation, a five dollar donation, every little thing goes to the kids and it all counts.
[14:19.10]It all adds up.
[14:20.08]No, when you say contractors, do you mean gun metal contractors?
[14:24.36]Miss Pauling came over and took all of his money.
[14:27.71]Miss Pauling, I like reversed.
[14:29.59]I was so bad at doing my contract, she wanted me to pay her.
[14:37.04]No!
[14:39.10]I was just so high in the air.
[14:40.96]How did I even get that high?
[14:44.09]You still medic-ing?
[14:45.94]Yeah, I'm still doing that.
[14:48.36]I should probably stop doing that.
[14:49.50]I got, like, bored of my life.
[14:51.17]Like, is anyone, like, bored of medics?
[14:54.58]I like medic.
[14:55.99]I do too, but I don't know.
[14:58.06]You know, once everyone's doing it, like, I want to be one of the cool kids.
[15:01.84]No one's using the Iron Bomber, dude.
[15:03.22]Do you remember our Medic Adventures?
[15:04.44]I love that item.
[15:05.95]Do you guys have Medic Adventures?
[15:08.27]I've wiped them.
[15:09.45]Yeah, he's never my mom.
[15:13.28]You're just not the guy you used to be, and I don't really want to associate with you anymore, so if you could please just go.
[15:17.66]It's all Chipotle, no fun for you anymore.
[15:22.75]Kids Chipotle.
[15:24.80]Chipotle.
[15:25.68]Everyone's talking about Chipotle.
[15:27.47]Please.
[15:29.39]Please.
[15:29.87]Alright, what do you talk about?
[15:31.78]I ate Chipotle like three times.
[15:33.85]I gave it three separate... Strike three.
[15:36.31]What?
[15:37.35]It was just... Please.
[15:41.69]So what's your alternative, then?
[15:43.73]Moe's.
[15:44.95]What is Moe's?
[15:46.14]Moe's is just way better.
[15:48.32]Moe's has queso.
[15:49.36]Yeah.
[15:50.18]Queso is the key.
[15:51.32]That's all they have.
[15:53.24]No, no, no.
[15:54.80]That's all you need, though, is queso.
[15:56.73]Yes, they do.
[15:57.67]I don't think they have that in Chicago.
[15:59.37]I think they don't have cheese in Chicago.
[16:02.69]Here's my problem.
[16:03.77]I think I've talked about this before, but Chipotle is like...
[16:06.29]When you go to Chipotle, there's like a line that goes out the door.
[16:10.68]Yeah.
[16:11.42]For tacos?
[16:13.98]Mm-hmm.
[16:14.14]Or burritos.
[16:15.34]Yeah, but why does it have to be like a line going outside the establishment?
[16:18.60]Oh, because people like burritos.
[16:21.41]Yeah, haven't you played Rollercoaster Tycoon?
[16:23.27]You make the line go a little bit easier around, and then you drop the prices of the pickles.
[16:26.91]You don't have 40 cents for pickles.
[16:28.69]Take it down, dude.
[16:30.10]And you charge $3 or $50 for the restroom.
[16:33.24]And you charge your money for the bathrooms?
[16:36.25]You're gonna charge me money to use your bathroom, Star?
[16:40.13]Yeah, you wanna come over?
[16:41.02]You are at your new place, too.
[16:45.42]Yeah, I already installed.
[16:46.36]I had the landlord over.
[16:47.27]He was over here putting a credit card slider on the bathroom door.
[16:50.59]Nice.
[16:52.19]We're renting the apartment, but we can't actually go in the bathroom unless we pay the entry fee.
[16:59.83]That would be so bad.
[17:02.02]Yeah.
[17:02.58]What would you do?
[17:03.62]Just go in the woods?
[17:05.34]I guess.
[17:05.78]It'd be kind of like paying $3 for laundry.
[17:09.46]Do you still do that?
[17:11.79]Yes.
[17:12.49]Oh, boy.
[17:13.67]It's like the same.
[17:14.83]Imagine you had to walk downstairs and like pay to go in the train.
[17:18.35]That's like the life of laundry.
[17:21.53]Yeah, I haven't had to pay for laundry since college.
[17:25.38]Wow.
[17:27.66]I'd like to not pay for laundry.
[17:30.23]Yeah, I have the laziest establishment here.
[17:33.40]My laundry is in my bathroom where my shower is.
[17:36.82]So I just like take a rip off my clothes, just throw it into the... I don't even have a laundry basket.
[17:41.91]I don't own one.
[17:42.71]Yeah, I have pictures.
[17:44.99]It just goes directly into the washer?
[17:47.20]Yeah, I just take off... I take off my clothes when I'm about to go in the shower or whatever I'm going to do in the bathroom.
[17:51.92]I just like throw it right into the washer.
[17:54.55]I mean, that's efficiency right there.
[17:55.91]It's pretty efficient.
[17:56.69]Yeah, it is.
[17:57.93]And then when it gets full, I turn it on.
[18:01.15]So I'm getting word that Jerma's shell shocker rocket launcher has been added to the auction list and Ster has it in his backpack.
[18:08.76]Yeah.
[18:10.66]Can you show that off for us real quick?
[18:12.22]So it's being auctioned.
[18:13.71]I have to open up the gift.
[18:14.91]Can you do that?
[18:16.03]I'm just going to open up the gift and put it on.
[18:18.15]I don't know.
[18:19.14]I will still say gifted from Jerma because he gave it to me.
[18:24.70]Which is not open it.
[18:26.12]Yeah, put it in there.

[18:53.99]Can we get a Geiger over there?
[18:55.33]That item's so cool.
[18:56.33]It's just like it looks cool when it's on you, when you're holding it.
[18:59.84]Even the wood parts have textures.
[19:01.16]I was unaware of this.
[19:03.18]So you are right now playing with the auction item that's in my auction.

[19:20.90]I'm going to need someone to jock-shock me.
[19:22.60]And it's stack track, too.
[19:23.78]I'll do it.
[19:24.26]You know, just for the sake of it, just so people can understand what it looks like when it's got its... Because that's really how it's going to be getting used.
[19:31.52]Yeah, that's how it's going to be getting used.
[19:32.78]If you're not putting it in like a... Oh, oh!
[19:37.32]You're not putting it in a collector's case.
[19:40.12]Where are you?
[19:41.20]I just got obliterated.
[19:43.84]Unfortunately, I'm sorry, whoever was going to get that item.
[19:46.39]He already took it out of the clamshell.
[19:48.37]And that's a huge no-no for collectors.
[19:50.67]You pulled it out of the clamshell, dude?
[19:53.80]That's unbelievable.
[19:56.32]I'm going to put it back in the clamshell and no one will even know.
[19:59.44]Yes, they will.
[20:00.21]The seams will be broken.
[20:03.56]I can't go anywhere.

[22:10.89]Thank you.
[22:11.73]I wonder why that was to help.
[22:14.42]That's great.
[22:16.23]I think that was Star's fault.
[22:17.97]He just gotta ask for it one more time.
[22:19.73]Yep.
[22:20.49]Well, you see, if he did it correctly... You have to say please.
[22:23.34]It's a magic word.
[22:23.72]He didn't do it correctly.
[22:25.24]It's, you know, he's... It's not jock shock me.

[23:14.97]Yeah, I got one sock on.
[23:18.15]Yeah.
[23:18.45]For some reason, I'm wearing a baseball hat.
[23:21.50]Hey, Mela, I mean, I was going to rocket jump, but your air blast was the size of, like, a football field.
[23:28.42]$10 from Miles saying, I have never done this before.

[23:43.40]I think I've done it.
[23:45.77]I've given you crits enough times.
[23:47.35]We haven't even used it once.
[23:48.99]We just did it two times.
[23:50.53]No, you didn't even actually do it.
[23:52.85]Yes, we did.
[23:54.25]This guy healing me right now doesn't even have a crit.
[23:56.12]He's like, he doesn't understand.
[23:57.98]He's like, not welcome back to the next step of the hat.
[24:04.00]Look, now I'm just going to play... Oh my goodness.
[24:07.71]Okay, fine.
[24:08.67]This is your last chance.
[24:11.43]I have pending items at the main menu.
[24:13.46]I don't know what they are.
[24:14.52]It's probably another Kurtz Krieg.
[24:15.50]I need this man.
[24:17.76]Alright, just build it.
[24:18.50]Just build it.
[24:19.07]Just build it.

[24:27.18]That thing is... Oh, please.
[24:30.06]I feel like we're the only targets.
[24:31.74]I don't know why.
[24:32.36]That guy had his own... He took the Jog Shocker.
[24:35.15]Pick that one up.
[24:35.67]Let's see if it's as nice looking.
[24:37.05]It's the same one.
[24:38.25]Oh.
[24:39.17]Run.
[24:39.53]Run.
[24:39.97]Run.
[24:41.61]I'll be fine.
[24:42.01]That guy has a football field for a weapon.
[24:43.77]He's gonna blast you off, dude.
[24:44.99]No, he's not!
[24:46.31]Just... get him away from me!
[24:48.55]Oh my god.
[24:48.77]Wow, I'm so much better than you.
[24:50.49]I'm fine!
[24:53.70]I'm the luckiest crit of his life, right?
[24:56.58]What was that, Melee?
[24:57.04]Well, you keep saying that and it keeps happening, yeah.
[24:58.80]Welcome to the game.
[25:01.22]Melee, you're playing... Pyro, man?
[25:03.73]Yeah, I'm playing Backburner Pyro.

[25:09.41]That's what I was looking for!
[25:17.74]I got backstabbed.
[25:19.38]Luckiest crit of your life.
[25:21.66]That's what the Backburner does.
[25:25.91]That's just how the weapon works.
[25:28.13]Hey, no.
[25:29.13]You know how back detection is in this game?
[25:31.24]I think it's still luck-based.

[30:28.63]Let's do it.

[31:00.44]Congratulations to you, my friend.
[31:03.20]Excellent work.
[31:04.76]I don't think I've ever done that.
[31:06.01]Yeah, I think I've done it maybe once or twice.
[31:08.49]It's an accomplishment.
[31:13.24]Okay, what map are we going to?
[31:14.42]Oh, Thunder Mountain.
[31:16.00]Hey, last night we were going to go to Powerhouse and it never happened.
[31:19.75]Oh, yeah.
[31:21.17]Seabear had never seen it.
[31:22.18]Still hasn't seen it.
[31:24.28]Can we show Seabear Powerhouse?
[31:26.00]He's not even here.
[31:27.46]He's probably watching in the production area.
[31:29.97]Somebody go find him and show him a photograph.
[31:32.33]Like a Polaroid.
[31:33.45]Take a Polaroid, shake it a little bit, wait like two hours before he can see the image, and then let him know.
[31:39.86]This here is Powerhouse.
[31:42.67]We're going to Borneo again.
[31:43.61]Borneo's great for Borneo.
[31:44.95]Borneo, Borneo, Borneo, Borneo, Borneo.
[31:49.57]That was a good joke by TruckTruck that was sadly, sadly talked over by some other more inexperienced streamers.
[31:58.30]While we wait for the server here, I'm going to read some more donations and we are actually in the pub.
[32:03.25]But $20 from Hybrid.
[32:05.11]You guys are the ones making the TF2 community amazing.
[32:07.95]I can't believe how much money you guys have raised.
[32:10.18]Hope you guys have an awesome day.
[32:12.14]Greets from Norway.
[32:13.54]Smiley face.
[32:14.48]P.S.
[32:15.00]Say hi to Jerma and Star from me.
[32:17.53]Aww.
[32:18.56]Hello.
[32:19.64]We can put that pin in Norway now that we've got a donation from Norway.
[32:25.95]Let's go to Norway.
[32:27.38]We have a friend there.
[32:28.24]Do you guys have a tracker for how many countries?
[32:30.68]I think we need to at the end.
[32:32.84]We need to make a map.
[32:34.09]And have a pin in every country that donated.
[32:36.67]Yeah, that'd be awesome.
[32:38.33]It'd be like the Nintendo 3DS system when you get the spot passes from people in different countries.
[32:43.46]It'd be like Call of Duty.
[32:44.82]We can see the map when you're online.
[32:48.24]Yeah, we would be the UAV.
[32:51.57]UAV.
[32:52.90]I think we're back to that server thing.
[32:55.53]On maps, it just seems to not be able to handle it.
[32:59.57]What a good opportunity to put this on Thunderdome.
[33:02.31]I think it slowly lets people in.
[33:04.32]Very slowly.
[33:05.46]It does.
[33:05.98]Like five people will be in here by the time... We have five people in here right now.
[33:13.91]When I close my eyes, I see this map.
[33:16.31]Is there a way to move off this map?
[33:19.67]Just move?
[33:21.61]Is there a way to move off of this map?
[33:23.49]Like I said, every time I close my eyes, I see it.
[33:29.22]$5 from Nate the Great.
[33:31.24]Jerma and Star, best power couple 2015.
[33:34.75]Bloodsire is bae, and that tip of the hat rocks.
[33:39.36]Again, that one got red.
[33:40.22]Keep mentioning me, guys, and you are sure to get red.
[33:45.59]Well, who's trying to put it on Hightower?
[33:48.83]I looked for Poundhouse in the vote, and it wasn't even there.
[33:52.77]A Hightower?
[33:53.72]You want to put this on a Hightower?
[33:55.42]I don't know.
[33:56.48]It was one of the only choices.
[33:59.48]They're wiped.
[34:00.38]There was three choices.
[34:01.44]It was Hightower, Dust Bowl.
[34:04.65]I'd rather play on Dust Bowl than Hightower.
[34:06.79]I'd rather play on Dust Bowl.
[34:10.09]I'd rather play with people.
[34:12.76]There's like nobody that I like on this server.
[34:16.44]Stark is going in.
[34:22.78]$100 from Lon.
[34:25.41]Got into TF2 at first from Jerma's goofy take care everyone videos.
[34:30.07]You guys are so genuine in helping these kids.
[34:32.20]I wanted to help as well.
[34:33.68]Here's to getting 200 kids at camp.
[34:36.01]Aw, thank you.
[34:36.85]Thank you for your donation.
[34:38.03]Our goofy take care everyone videos?
[34:40.59]That's the type of videos we've been making?
[34:42.88]He's talking about my, like... I know.
[34:45.90]I know, but that's, like, those are the videos.
[34:48.91]That's what you do.
[34:49.85]He only watches for the outros.
[34:51.67]Well, no, it's, like, to take care of everybody.
[34:53.61]Like, take care.
[34:54.31]Like, I want everyone to take care.
[34:56.99]He wants to take care now, too.
[34:58.46]Like, how do you not see that?
[35:00.32]I see it.
[35:00.80]I just... Alright.
[35:05.46]We are currently at, like, seven people in the server.
[35:08.07]This is going well.
[35:09.47]This is going alright.
[35:12.76]Got him.
[35:14.87]So let's contact an admin and try to change this map to Thunder Mountain.
[35:20.10]Alright, let's just scream at the top of our lungs for Sean Bun.
[35:25.07]This map is not on Thunder Mountain in 10 seconds.
[35:29.89]Alright.
[35:31.10]I am going to put a hole in my wall.
[35:36.88]I will see what's up.
[35:38.22]I'll be right back, guys.
[35:40.26]Nice try, dude.
[35:41.48]Three, two, one.
[35:47.41]Put a hole in my wall.
[35:49.91]No one... No, no, no, no.
[35:56.34]That was almost bad.
[35:59.16]Yeah.
[36:00.22]You should call those contractors back.
[36:04.42]I got to, like, move my drink.
[36:06.61]to make like I'm gonna put and I must just kicked the way you cannot be sitting here that's gonna capsize and break it already happened once well well I think I'm going to send a map or the revision are you actually gonna go yeah it is a random server yeah guys I have I have to go I got a car waiting outside heading over to a Thunder Mountain I'll be right back where is Thunder Mountain
[36:31.44]I think actually in the lore.
[36:33.85]Yes.
[36:34.59]Inside Miss Pauling.
[36:36.60]Oh, alright.
[36:38.49]Here's another donation saying how good I am.
[36:40.39]It says, $5 from Akoala saying, Blood is best host.
[36:44.32]That's fake star.
[36:45.60]I'm the real star.
[36:46.84]Get your head in the game.
[36:48.20]That faker out of there.
[36:49.90]This joke is still funny.
[36:51.44]Star and join together forever.
[36:53.00]I stole my mom's credit card for the kids.
[36:55.29]That is a long message.
[36:57.47]Long message.
[36:58.37]That was solid, though.
[37:00.79]You just thought it was over.
[37:02.15]Hit all the points.
[37:05.30]I was telling people, I think maybe a week ago on a stream, not to steal their mom's credit cards.
[37:10.83]Maybe even that's the guy who just still has it.
[37:13.90]Give that back.
[37:16.12]It's a good cause.
[37:18.31]You know what the best cause is?
[37:19.99]Your mother.
[37:21.95]You should probably just tell your mother at some point if she's looking for a credit card for something.
[37:29.57]Probably be like, yeah, Ma, I have it.
[37:31.61]I'm sorry.
[37:32.11]I used it a bunch of times.
[37:34.12]It's for the kids, though.
[37:34.66]But I've been working really hard.
[37:35.44]I got a paper route to pay you back.
[37:37.10]Here's the money.
[37:37.76]I feel just awful.
[37:39.41]And maybe she'll be like, oh, you know, it was for the kids.
[37:42.19]Okay, son.
[37:42.83]Then it's okay.
[37:43.93]Then it's alright.
[37:45.19]Shout out to Mom.
[37:48.02]Unless you also maxed out that card by another stuff.
[37:53.11]Because then if you did that, then she's probably not going to be too happy.
[37:59.10]Were these 4,000 tennis balls for the kids?
[38:02.09]What were you doing?
[38:03.67]Yeah, and then you're gonna have to, like, rationalize that, like, no, but, I mean, I got those just in case.
[38:07.99]I needed them, you know, just, you know, for the kid, just in case.
[38:11.10]I was gonna bring them.
[38:13.22]I'm just gonna get really mad at you.
[38:14.44]You lift over his blanket and there's just tennis balls everywhere.
[38:17.59]You just don't get in that game.
[38:19.21]Why tennis balls?
[38:20.23]I don't know.
[38:20.93]What does that accomplish for you?
[38:22.31]There's no point.
[38:22.93]That's why.
[38:23.39]It's just, why would you do that?
[38:24.70]I'd be upset as a parent.
[38:28.19]Yeah, I think, uh-oh, we still have six people in here.
[38:31.98]$20 from Klutz.
[38:33.84]Third set of 20.
[38:35.06]Hopefully it gets red.
[38:36.20]Oh, it is, my friend.
[38:37.55]Oh, and could you ask Ster if he has chocolate on his knees and what color his socks are?
[38:42.45]P.S., whoever is reading this is a great guy.
[38:45.76]You are a great person, my friend.
[38:48.04]And Star, what color are your socks?
[38:50.84]I would like to confirm before answering both of those questions.
[38:54.57]I'm fairly certain neither of those are references to anything that has ever happened.
[38:58.86]This person is just a psychopath.
[39:00.52]It's just random questions.
[39:01.76]There are no chocolate on my knees.
[39:04.02]My socks are white.
[39:05.73]He needed to know what color your socks were.
[39:07.79]Fairly standard stuff going on here.
[39:09.69]And actually, if we are going to change the maps, we can even do arena if there's only going to be three people to start.
[39:13.96]Can this not be fixed?
[39:16.22]Things happen.
[39:17.98]This is some weird thing that always happens.
[39:20.07]People get in, but it just takes a long time.
[39:23.63]There's so many people joining at once.
[39:25.81]Getting launched.
[39:27.65]That happened two times in a row.
[39:29.40]I forgot that you had that entire sentry nest there in a 3v3.
[39:33.02]I just died to it twice.
[39:34.90]It's too dynamic.
[39:35.90]I thought someone else got it.
[39:37.20]We're like, where's my team at?
[39:40.73]Moving it.
[39:42.65]I am moving it.
[39:43.71]Look at them.
[39:44.97]I don't even care if it's right in their way.
[39:47.08]Put it in the way.
[39:51.62]Just remember, guys, the auctions are now open to get items from Star, Jerma, and Musalk, and Stabby.
[39:58.29]So you can just join the Tip of the Hats team group, check the discussions forum, and bid on the items.
[40:03.58]Win those items.
[40:04.24]It's pretty great.
[40:05.50]The Australian scattergun that's on there as well, I bought that the day after Tip of the Hats last year just for the sole purpose to use it for a year until I could give it away.
[40:14.82]I've been waiting.
[40:18.04]That's pretty big planning there.
[40:19.34]A year ahead of time.
[40:20.02]There we go.
[40:20.90]Yeah, I let my stream name it.
[40:22.46]They chose really awful names, but, like, I mean, it's authentic.
[40:26.15]Hey, if you were planning on it for a year, I would bid on that item.
[40:28.97]That's great.
[40:29.63]Good planning.
[40:31.55]It's great that right when the game starts.
[40:33.88]Yeah.
[40:34.90]If they just bid on it.
[40:37.30]I brought my level 3 sentry right on the train.
[40:41.24]Right when it started.
[40:41.98]That's not good.
[40:42.86]Oh, boy.
[40:44.25]Did I actually get back here?
[40:45.83]I don't think so.
[40:49.61]We just had a $1,000 donation from Necroa Owl saying, I hope you guys make it to 200K.
[40:58.04]Unfortunately, this is the last donation I can make, but good luck.
[41:02.56]You are fine.
[41:03.30]Yeah, thank you so much.
[41:04.83]You don't have to donate anymore.
[41:06.07]P.S., hello to Star and Jerma.
[41:07.49]You guys are my favorite YouTubers.
[41:09.89]Thank you so much, Necroa Owl, for the generous $1,000 donation.
[41:13.88]Yeah, amazing.
[41:15.68]That's at least the third that I know of.
[41:17.72]Yeah, I think that's multiple from him.
[41:19.40]Right, you're set, my friend.
[41:20.71]Thank you.
[41:21.01]Thank you so much.
[41:21.79]You can rest assured you did your part.
[41:27.00]So when are we getting the tip of the hat private jet?
[41:29.48]I hear that's a thing people do.
[41:31.66]Jet the kids to camp.
[41:32.54]We're waiting on you.
[41:35.01]What do I got to do?
[41:36.03]You have to fund it and deliver it.
[41:39.62]private jet.
[41:41.07]Oh.
[41:41.57]Next year.
[41:42.21]See, I'll plan on that for next year.
[41:43.29]I'll buy the private jet and use that for a year.
[41:46.29]That would be way more productive than a scattergun.
[41:49.43]Truck truck, that wasn't very nice.
[41:50.70]I needed that.
[41:53.40]Oh yeah?
[41:53.80]Get away from this body.
[41:56.56]What just happened?
[42:00.77]Well, what happened was the door opened and somebody was just waiting to shoot you right in the face.
[42:08.21]You probably would have killed me, too.
[42:09.45]Baila, you're not even good.
[42:12.98]What are you doing in Invite?
[42:14.58]That's what I get for looking at the monitor to see where you were again, so I could try to kill you.
[42:18.64]Every time you look, are you seriously doing that?
[42:21.85]Yeah, I mean, it's right up there.
[42:23.01]I can't not see it.
[42:24.87]So this whole land was orchestrated to, like, kill me in pubs.
[42:27.91]Yes.
[42:29.55]Alright, I can respect that.
[42:31.48]But it's for the kids.
[42:33.14]Alright, don't worry.
[42:33.70]I'm going to jock shock you again.
[42:35.04]This thing has a 15% increased chance to jock shock.
[42:38.74]I heard about that.
[42:41.26]It's in the lore, I think.
[42:44.24]Oh, get jock jock bananas.
[42:46.79]Get jock jocked?
[42:48.61]Get jock jocked.
[42:49.77]That's a new Pokémon.
[42:52.45]I'm going to move this sentry.
[42:54.99]I'm going to put this sentry in a very dangerous place.
[42:56.84]Stabby keeps trying to give me hugs.
[42:59.50]No.
[43:00.30]Don't do it.
[43:03.00]Don't do it.
[43:03.98]Oh, come on.
[43:07.54]We have a $20 donation from Jackie23.
[43:10.99]Jackie writes, I may not have cancer, but I struggle with a genetic disease every day that has changed my whole perspective on life.
[43:17.77]I love what Tip of the Hats is doing, and I want to say thank you to everyone, but especially Jerma for making me laugh during the craziest year of my life and helping me feel less alone in fighting what I have.
[43:28.04]Thanks for everything that you do.
[43:30.03]Stay weird.
[43:31.37]Thank you for your donation, Jackie.
[43:32.67]Wow.
[43:32.77]Thank you, Jackie.
[43:34.07]Yeah.
[43:34.79]Thanks a lot.
[43:36.40]I really appreciate that.
[43:39.60]It's a... It's a crazy feeling knowing that you're, like, helping somebody out or you're making somebody laugh or make somebody's day.
[43:47.92]It really is...
[43:49.88]It really is a great feeling knowing that.
[43:51.46]To have an actual, tangible change on someone's life is very meaningful and to do that as a YouTuber drummer I'm sure is fantastic and during this event that's what we're trying to do here.
[44:05.78]It's not often that as gamers we get to make that sort of an impact on people's lives.
[44:09.35]Yeah, I honestly wish I knew what that was like.
[44:14.67]IT'S JUST AMAZING.
[44:15.57]FOR YOUR FINAL THOUGHT THERE, STAY WEIRD.
[44:18.82]DON'T WORRY.
[44:19.82]THAT AIN'T NEVER GOING TO CHANGE.
[44:23.09]I'LL ALWAYS BE THE WEIRD GUY.
[44:26.44]YOU KNOW, IT'S DIAGNOSED, YOU KNOW.
[44:28.03]I'M A DIAGNOSED WEIRDO.
[44:30.17]IS THAT A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS THERE?
[44:31.97]Yeah, the doctor took me into the other room, and he was like, look, I don't want to embarrass you.
[44:35.23]You're freaking weird.
[44:36.24]Yeah, I don't want to embarrass you in front of all your friends, because all my friends came to the doctor's office with me.
[44:40.46]He's like, I don't want to embarrass you.
[44:41.59]You're doing, like, your birthday party.
[44:42.99]You're doing a doctor's office birthday party.
[44:46.35]Just, you are a weird, a weird son of a gun.
[44:50.30]Can I just tell you that?
[44:51.40]That's it, and that's what it said on the prescription.
[44:52.77]What happens when you go to see Dr. Ocher?
[44:55.61]And please don't come back with your birthday party.
[44:59.96]That's just... You're a weirdo.
[45:02.36]How can you not understand that?
[45:03.82]You proved it by having a birthday party here.
[45:05.85]Get out.
[45:06.49]We have this $25 donation from Swell saying, this will be my third and final donation.
[45:11.21]Thank you all very much for doing this and excited to see how well this is doing.
[45:15.92]Also, Star, if you could describe your day with a woodland animal, which animal would it be?
[45:22.88]That's an interesting question.
[45:24.98]Describe my day?
[45:26.17]If you could describe your day with a woodland animal, which animal would it be?
[45:30.89]Oh, like my day is an animal.
[45:32.37]Oh.
[45:33.32]The classic, you know, you're out in the deep forest and you just come across a cheetah.
[45:39.10]A cheetah?
[45:39.82]Gotta keep going.
[45:41.69]Is that a woodland animal?
[45:42.65]Is that a woodland animal?
[45:44.27]Yeah, I don't think... Okay, redo.
[45:46.47]Elephant.
[45:46.79]Redo.
[45:47.94]That's also not a woodland animal.
[45:50.42]When have you ever seen an elephant in a forest?
[45:52.93]OKAY, UM... HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE WOODS BEFORE?
[45:57.54]HAVE YOU BEEN OUTSIDE?
[45:58.42]LISTEN, LISTEN.
[45:59.38]WE'RE GOING ONE MORE.
[46:00.05]HIPPOPOTAMUS.
[46:01.31]OOH, NOT A GOOD CHOICE.
[46:02.89]NOW YOU'RE JUST TRYING.
[46:05.03]NOW YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO... NAME THREE WOODLAND ANIMALS.
[46:08.52]THERE'S SQUIRRELS, THERE'S A DEER, AND THERE IS NOTHING ELSE.
[46:12.04]THERE'S A DEER.
[46:12.74]CHIPMUNKS.
[46:13.51]There's one deer.
[46:15.85]You're naming big squirrels.
[46:19.76]I guess I'm going with squirrel.
[46:21.68]I feel like that's spirit animal.
[46:23.15]It's just they're all around.
[46:29.54]There's plenty.
[46:30.48]There's frog.
[46:31.34]You're forgetting the most important one.
[46:34.43]That's if you go to the swamp again, dude.
