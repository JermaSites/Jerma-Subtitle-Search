[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.87]Yeah, we're early.
[00:05.37]Very early, actually.
[00:06.37]Almost an hour early.
[00:10.51]I'm ready.
[00:12.65]I'm ready.
[00:13.05]You know how sometimes I tell you guys that sometimes I sit here and I'm just all set up.
[00:18.87]Things work.
[00:19.54]Everything's ready to go.
[00:20.84]And it's like 45 minutes to stream time.
[00:24.98]No, no, no, no, no.
[00:26.20]We're going now.
[00:27.56]I'm ready now.
[00:32.08]I'm that kind of person where if I had a show, and I went on stage, and the show was 7 o'clock, and people are funneling in at like 6.30, getting their seats, if I was ready, I would just come out and just start talking to people.
[00:48.35]Just like, hey, I'm ready to start my show.
[00:52.33]I would be, can I have a mic?
[00:53.93]And I would just, it'd be addressing people as they walked in to get their seats.
[00:58.34]And then it'd be like, alright, it's 7 o'clock, alright, now we can do the show.
[01:03.78]People would be pissed to start the show like 40 minutes early.
[01:08.30]People walk in, it's 20 minutes till the show's over.
[01:11.78]Oh, sorry guys.
[01:12.74]I really just had to- I really wanted to start.
[01:15.89]Be like, uh... Dickhead, these tickets were $285.
[01:19.41]They're in the front row.
[01:27.67]And it says there's a meet and greet after.
[01:29.41]Is that still happening?
[01:31.19]I don't feel like doing that anymore.
[01:36.72]Dude, I got free tickets to the Jerma stream.
[01:38.66]Yeah.
[01:40.00]But we had to start giving them away for free, because... I didn't really get anybody to come and pay for it.
[01:45.41]Anyways, we're gonna play Tony Hawk's Underground today.
[01:48.91]It's all ready to go.
[01:49.53]It works.
[01:53.61]This is, if you're wondering, the platform.
[01:56.69]This is Xbox.
[02:00.25]Xbox that has been upscaled to 1080 through backwards compatibility with 360.
[02:06.68]That's where we're at.
[02:10.00]That's why I'm playing it in 360.
[02:12.90]It should look a little crusty, but not too crusty where it's going to be annoying.
[02:17.24]I don't know.
[02:17.72]We'll find out.
[02:21.30]Just say you pirated it.
[02:22.94]Just say you pirated it.
[02:23.78]No one will care.
[02:24.38]I didn't.
[02:27.48]I got a 360 right next to me.
[02:28.74]I had to get a 360 hard drive.
[02:32.56]I'm playing this on a 360 right now.
[02:34.50]That's what it is.
[02:38.36]But there's not much else to say besides, here we go.
[02:43.44]By the way, I think I'm going to keep original music.
[02:48.44]So this entire VOD is going to be deleted.
[02:51.44]There might be like 10 seconds of this VOD.
[02:56.52]That is watchable.
[02:57.54]I'm really sorry, those of you that are VOD watchers.
[03:01.70]But... The last time we did this, we played Tony Hawk 2.
[03:05.04]No, don't.
[03:05.58]Spoilers.
[03:07.30]We played Tony Hawk 2.
[03:10.04]And I think I muted the music and it just fucked it all up.
[03:14.14]It just didn't feel right.
[03:15.14]It felt off.
[03:19.08]Is there skateboarding in this game?
[03:20.88]Uh, yep.
[03:24.08]No, you didn't.
[03:26.43]Oh, so Pyramid lied about turning the music off in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 for the Dreamcast.
[03:32.97]I don't think you can even make a username that long, so don't even try it.
[03:36.03]Alright, I'm ready.
[03:37.71]Let's go.
[03:41.47]So, there's the story mode.
[03:42.45]I'm going to do the story mode.
[03:44.07]That's obviously the easiest thing to do.
[03:47.73]I need to make a skater too, don't I?
[03:52.61]Let's create a skater to use in story mode.
[03:59.32]Stream will be chugging in just a moment.
[04:04.68]Please up the game volume.
[04:07.92]Oh, let's see what it looks like first.
[04:09.62]Alright, so.
[04:15.39]Create new.
[04:17.17]Create a new skater.
[04:17.95]That's like a Neversoft developer.
[04:21.43]Okay.
[04:23.11]Any unsaved changes to your current story that don't matter.
[04:25.61]Alright, pre-made skaters.
[04:32.23]Uh, pre-made?
[04:33.92]Steve?
[04:35.68]Becky?
[04:38.24]Mike?
[04:39.32]Jim?
[04:40.52]Chad?
[04:43.38]Joey?
[04:44.74]Sheena?
[04:46.08]Josh?
[04:47.51]Andy?
[04:49.67]Liz?
[04:50.43]Jack?
[04:50.89]Are these all game devs?
[04:53.71]These might be game devs.
[04:56.09]The suit.
[04:57.49]Tiger Swallow.
[05:00.60]Big Lion?
[05:02.63]green chick big pimp big pimping big pimping eddie well I want to make a I want to make one alright head information name custom skater age 16.
[05:27.17]It sucks to do this.
[05:30.24]You know what I mean?
[05:31.52]I remember playing games when it was on Xbox or PlayStation.
[05:35.36]It was like, yeah, alright.
[05:37.38]I'm done.
[05:38.70]Alright.
[05:42.96]That hurts.
[05:44.37]Stance.
[05:46.25]I would pick Goofy, but Goofy just means lefty, right?

[06:20.57]Tricks.
[06:21.91]Uh, street.
[06:22.53]I like going up high, but I also like manual too, so we're gonna do street.
[06:27.98]I gotta, I gotta Google what this is.
[06:29.18]What is Mongo?
[06:30.80]What is Mongo?
[06:32.62]Uh, Mongo skateboarding.
[06:45.73]A person skates Mongo if they use their leading foot in the front while riding to push.
[06:53.17]While they are pushing, the back foot stays near the rear of the board and they push with their front foot.
[06:59.76]So Mongo is a stupid way to skateboard.
[07:01.70]This is the official definition.
[07:03.82]It's a bad habit.
[07:04.38]Okay, never Mongo.
[07:13.10]Goofy, always, Mongo.
[07:14.66]Okay, never Mongo, regular stance.

[08:27.92]Bernie, Ernie.
[08:29.04]Ernie.
[08:29.58]It's just Bernie.
[08:30.42]It's Ernie.
[08:32.32]Alright, Ernie.
[08:34.82]I don't have a last name.
[08:35.83]I'm just Ernie.
[08:38.15]No, I'm just Ernie.
[08:39.01]Alright, well, Ernie is in 34.
[08:41.19]That's not even me, so I can change these.
[08:45.49]Whatever.
[08:45.83]40 from Boston.
[08:47.13]Ernie.
[08:49.69]Head options.
[08:50.61]Face.
[08:54.40]Can I rotate?
[08:55.16]Okay.
[08:55.50]Can I?
[08:56.66]Whoa.
[09:12.74]Gray skin?
[09:16.08]Gray.
[09:17.63]Eyes?
[09:17.89]Alright, that's... I can't do eyes.
[09:20.35]That's gonna fuck me up.
[09:22.53]Yeah, that's the... What was that game that Ubisoft came out with?
[09:28.31]That was a fucking mess.
[09:29.53]It was like a... What was it?
[09:31.02]It was a... What's it called?
[09:33.56]Assassin's Creed Unity.
[09:34.98]Yes, that's the one.
[09:36.84]This is every YouTuber's thumbnail for an Assassin's Creed Unity video.
[09:40.02]I mean, I would've done it.
[09:49.90]Gray skin.
[09:51.27]Let's see what else we can do.
[09:55.95]Hold on.
[09:56.67]Wait.
[10:03.55]Oh, that doesn't... I can just be blue.
[10:09.76]What... Okay, what is Ernie?
[10:14.66]I think... I don't know if I want to just be like a wacky color or something.
[10:18.10]You know what I mean?
[10:18.82]No.
[10:23.99]I don't want to be like orange or like blue.
[10:27.73]I don't want to be like lime green.
[10:31.69]Let's take the satchel.
[10:40.91]I can be like a glow stick.
[10:42.41]Alright, should I be a glow stick?
[10:51.99]Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[10:53.75]Alright, fine.
[10:54.29]I'll be a glow stick.
[10:55.66]No, no, no.
[10:56.62]I'm going to hate that after like fucking three hours.
[10:58.68]How about kind of glow stick?
[10:59.64]How about just sick?
[11:10.59]Select back here.
[11:26.79]It's my hair.
[11:28.21]The middle part.
[11:30.89]No, no, no.
[11:32.35]Come over.
[11:33.03]No, this is all too easy.
[11:34.05]It has to- It has to- It's too easy.
[11:36.09]Medium, medium.
[11:36.59]Actually, I kinda like this one.
[11:53.17]Spiked long.
[11:56.33]No, no.
[11:58.09]I kind of like the clown hair.
[12:00.84]No, I don't.
[12:02.72]Literally spikes is what I thought that said.
[12:04.84]Pompadour.
[12:05.42]I like it.
[12:06.02]Eraser hair.
[12:06.46]I think I like the pompadour.
[12:16.28]How do I do hair color?
[12:16.96]Making the same color as my skin.
[12:18.62]I'm not sure I can even replicate it again.
[12:36.44]Shrek 5.
[12:36.88]Zoomer Shrek.
[12:37.22]No, I don't want it.
[12:38.50]I don't like this.
[12:39.34]Something else.
[13:03.37]Ah, how about... Alright, I'll do middle part.
[13:07.05]That's fine.
[13:07.65]I don't care.
[13:08.95]Whatever.
[13:09.41]That's just my hair.
[13:10.71]Facial hair.
[13:11.65]Beard.
[13:33.28]Mustache, long sideburns?
[13:34.48]What?
[13:34.80]No, I don't want it.
[13:36.08]Honest Abe.
[13:48.55]Did it be Honest Abe?
[13:49.73]It just looks like he has a helmet on.
[13:54.35]Chinless Abe.
[13:55.53]Okay, it just looks like he has a weird helmet on.
[13:58.67]It's gonna be lower saturation.
[14:30.47]It's just wearing a scarf with your own hair.
[14:34.06]Is this a- okay, is this a hairstyle?
[14:41.42]Having your hair go all the way down to the bottom and come all the way to the right, is this a- like, is the wearing a helmet of your own hair a style?
[14:50.44]Can't get the color exact.
[14:51.81]That's close?
[14:52.41]That's good.
[15:10.64]That's good.
[15:10.94]That's alright.
[15:11.56]That looks good.
[15:12.19]That looks fine.
[15:13.01]Uh, hats.
[15:22.40]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, no, no, no, no...
[15:36.00]I already have a helmet on. No, no, nope...
[15:46.28]How about the dunce?
[15:47.56]Okay, I like that one.
[15:51.42]I like the dunce hat.
[15:52.64]I get to be the guy that wears the dunce hat today.
[15:54.68]Hold on, let's see the others.
[15:58.42]Viking helmet?
[15:59.62]British officer.
[16:01.14]A British Bobby.
[16:02.92]Oh, I kind of like this too.
[16:03.82]That's so stupid.
[16:04.42]If I could wear a wizard hat...
[16:19.73]But if I do a wizard hat, then I have to be a wizard.
[16:28.64]What about the earmuffs?
[16:31.34]Just be a wizard.
[16:32.14]But I have to do like a big long wizard beard.
[16:34.23]No, I don't want to do that.
[16:35.29]I'm going dunce.
[16:43.89]Can you even make a long beard?
[16:50.57]Can you even make a long beard?
[16:56.30]Let's see.
[17:02.04]Facial hair, let's go.
[17:03.42]Beard.
[17:04.48]No, you can't.
[17:06.50]It's just painted on.
[17:07.44]Guys, this game came out in like 2004, 2003.
[17:22.03]Now, we're gonna have to go dump.
[17:24.69]Or, or actually I like the earmuffs.
[17:28.21]The earmuffs to me are funnier.
[17:30.67]I'm going earmuffs.
[17:31.87]Wait, paper bag?
[17:50.11]But no, no, that sucked.
[17:51.46]That's just the eyes with more space.
[17:54.28]Fake Dick Dastardly Richard?
[18:21.38]I might be able to make it pretty close.
[18:24.81]Let's see if I can.
[18:33.15]Dammit, I can't put glasses on the front.
[18:35.41]Okay.
[18:35.79]We got short style.
[18:36.35]We could, we could, it could be pretty close.
[18:56.73]I need a jacket.
[18:58.01]Here we go, we're gonna take this blue.
[18:59.56]T-shirt and long, no, this blue.
[19:34.03]Make it darker.
[19:38.23]Man, makeup.
[19:41.58]It's a little too dark.
[19:42.60]Yeah, it's alright though.
[19:43.84]It ended up being perfect.
[19:47.10]It's a zipper hoodie, you fake fan.
[19:50.86]I can't... What, you want me to go through every option to find the zipper hoodie?
[19:54.41]And that's not even true.
[20:01.81]Dick Dastardly Richard...
[20:04.39]It's not a zipper hoodie.
[20:07.01]It's not a hoodie.
[20:08.53]Who's the fake fan?
[20:16.14]It's this, but long sleeve.
[20:18.70]Because there are no zippers.
[20:29.51]It's not a hoodie.
[20:30.19]It's just a jacket.
[20:40.51]This actually is probably pretty damn close.
[20:44.93]Let's see.
[20:45.41]Suit coat?
[20:46.13]No.
[20:46.65]Alright, remember jogger jacket.
[20:55.12]Hmm.
[20:55.30]I think jogger jacket's the one.
[21:01.26]It's gotta make it weird and light blue and splotchy.
[21:16.92]I mean, the reason why that shirt looks so different and odd is because it's a game from 1995.
[21:22.32]I can't add Nintendo 64 pixels.
[21:33.93]It's a little lighter than that.
[21:34.83]It's like this.
[21:39.82]That's close.
[21:40.24]This is close enough.
[21:41.98]Alright, now the second color...
[21:45.14]Oh, I can't even make it the second color.
[21:46.50]It's alright.
[21:47.84]Close enough.
[21:48.24]Uh, what about gloves?
[21:54.08]Spike neck?
[21:56.02]Wristband?
[21:56.54]What do you gloves?
[21:58.80]Wrist tape?
[21:59.80]Elbow band?
[22:00.48]No.
[22:00.72]Gloves.
[22:01.06]Here we go.
[22:01.42]Gloves.
[22:11.61]Can't wear gloves?
[22:16.84]Is it because I'm green or something?
[22:21.60]I can't believe this is actually kind of working.
[22:24.10]Alright, these are... They're white, but they're pixelated and crappy and smudged with 42 kilobyte, like, yellow and brown pixels.
[22:38.56]So we're gonna go zebra like it is in the video.
[22:53.91]I can't make these longer.
[23:00.71]Suit pants.
[23:02.17]Jogger.
[23:03.76]He's just going to be in a jogging suit.
[23:11.54]Let me see if I...
[23:26.41]He's got a stripe going down.
[23:28.19]And his boots, he's got these red... Bare feet?
[23:36.38]Oh, it's too bad I can't make him in bare feet.
[23:39.80]If I make these red, this will be fine.
[23:48.76]Anything chunkier than this?
[23:50.59]He's a chunky.
[23:56.34]Well, then this guy's not Ernie anymore.
[24:02.08]This is not Ernie.
[24:05.70]This is Dick Dastardly Richard.
[24:09.57]Alright, these are... Are they boots?
[24:14.31]There we go.
[24:21.77]What happened to Ernie?
[24:22.99]Like, that's... I want Ernie.
[24:30.11]Fuck, Ernie.
[24:39.45]Head top.
[24:39.87]Wait, you can... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[24:43.76]We can't see any of this.
[24:44.92]Wait, you can... What?
[24:47.26]Nope.
[24:47.76]Nope.
[24:48.02]The fucking head's coming off.
[24:49.96]That's coming off.
[24:54.68]Ernie can be a big fan of Dick Dastardly Richard.
[24:57.00]This is coming off.
[25:01.42]He just dresses as him because he likes that video.
[25:05.68]No.
[25:05.92]You're telling me I have full-on base scaling options?
[25:14.76]What?
[25:28.51]How big should... I don't want him to be too huge.
[25:34.67]No, this is not Dick Dastley Richards' origin story.
[25:38.31]This is Ernie the Fan.
[25:43.91]You can make him Megamind.
[25:46.10]Head top?
[25:51.78]Where is this going?
[25:52.46]Oh, okay.
[25:53.40]Let's do it this way.
[25:54.10]At least don't make him green.
[26:01.23]We'll fix it.
[26:01.85]Hold on.
[26:04.83]Yeah, this is Big Fan Ernie.
[26:08.19]Big Fan Ernie.
[26:09.91]That's what his name is changing to.
[26:17.44]Super wide.
[26:30.29]Big Head Funny.
[26:32.03]His head's not that big.
[26:35.25]His head's not even that big.
[26:50.53]But it is funny though.
[26:53.61]Is it?
[26:57.21]His head's not even that big.
[27:16.28]That's too extreme, though.
[27:17.79]That's way too extreme.
[27:31.83]Yeah, I don't want him to have, like, an orc mouth.
[27:34.53]How about... Alright, that's okay.
[27:43.18]Chest.
[27:45.02]Oh, shit.
[27:57.14]Alright, I like this.
[27:59.90]This big, gross stomach.
[28:02.50]And tiny, tiny chest.
[28:12.13]Blink?
[28:13.33]Hold on.
[28:27.38]Big biceps.
[28:31.67]Forearms.
[28:35.19]Yeah, I don't... I gotta take the beard off, too.
[28:37.73]It just looks stupid.
[28:42.17]Huge hands.
[28:44.98]Or small hands.
[28:46.18]We gotta make them kind of like a pair.
[29:05.61]Alright.
[29:07.39]Why does the jaw look still so strange?
[29:26.82]Without the facial hair.
[29:31.63]I think it's good.
[29:32.79]I think it's good.
[29:35.73]Big fan Ernie, I think is good.
[29:48.34]He's an alien.
[29:55.62]Alright, we got it.
[29:57.06]We're done.
[29:57.72]Scale options.
[29:58.78]Body.
[30:00.70]That's good.
[30:01.16]Just make him normal.
[30:06.46]Okay.
[30:09.61]I don't need to do any of this stuff.
[30:11.51]Wait, does it matter?
[30:12.91]Helmet.
[30:14.03]No, who cares.
[30:21.74]Does Big Fan Ernie need to be protected?
[30:23.36]Alright, Big Fan Ernie can wear knee pads.
[30:32.65]These look like metal shackles!
[30:35.43]Not knee pads!
[30:38.89]Oh, look at the elbow pads!
[30:41.77]I can't even wear elbow pads.
[30:50.81]I'm gonna be so safe.
[31:02.41]Okay, that's fine.
[31:03.97]I'm done.
[31:12.16]I can't unsee the cow.
[31:13.84]I cannot unsee the cow legs now that you said that.
[31:25.04]information big fan ernie well how about bovine ernie that's not bad either I think I'm gonna go with I'm going bovine ernie
[31:54.16]Can't wait for this guy to get instantly eliminated in the next Rumble.
[31:57.46]He's going to have zero stats.
[32:02.53]Bovine Ernie.
[32:03.29]How is everything going to be however late on the stream?
[32:09.85]Alright, Bovine Ernie.
[32:10.81]There he is.
[32:11.19]From... Whatever.
[32:16.27]He could be like my neighbor or something.
[32:17.64]I don't care.
[32:19.42]How high can this go?
[32:22.62]40 is fine.
[32:23.08]He cares.
[32:24.74]Done.
[32:29.95]Okay, save skater.
[32:32.07]See, that doesn't like it.
[32:33.45]I can't get over it.
[32:38.85]Alright, here we go.
[32:41.59]Let's start a career.
[32:50.80]He's saved.
[32:54.43]Should have been Dick Dastardly Richard.
[32:57.59]Well, it's, it's Bovine Ernie.
[33:01.07]New story.
[33:02.53]Uh, beginning normal.
[33:04.95]I'm not doing 2003 hard.
[33:05.65]No.
[33:05.73]I'm doing normal.
[33:06.35]2003 hard is 2020, like, insane, impossible.
[33:08.33]Let's go.
[33:24.81]Why am I wearing these inside?
[33:26.15]I am dressed.
[33:26.75]I'm already dressed in my shackles.
[33:50.43]Wait, they talk?
[33:51.07]I didn't know they actually spoke.
[33:52.89]He's fully voice acted.
[34:11.12]What?
[34:11.30]Well, I gotta turn the volume up.
[34:12.60]Oh, by the way, yeah, again, this whole thing's gonna get muted, just in case you didn't know.
[34:42.80]It doesn't look that bad on Xbox 360.
[34:44.26]Alright, let's talk.
[34:46.55]What up, Eric?
[34:48.85]Hey, help me out here.
[34:50.07]What do you need help with?
[34:53.55]I was just skating, minding my own, and the dealers grabbed my board.
[34:57.23]They tore it apart and threw the pieces up on the roof.
[35:00.50]My knee is wrecked.
[35:01.60]Could you grab them for me?
[35:02.98]I gotta get on the roof?
[35:04.48]Aw, man.
[35:08.36]Here, I'll hold you down.
[35:10.33]Use A to jump, and R to grab onto stuff, and then pull yourself up.
[35:14.45]Press A to continue, so you jump and you hold.
[35:16.45]Hit R to grab onto stuff.
[35:19.47]Oh, I'm actually walking around.
[35:20.71]I forget everything about this game.
[35:26.76]Next part should be on the house across the alley.
[35:29.04]Jump, then grab the gutter.
[35:50.56]You can get off the board to get over terrain that would normally be hard or impossible to skate over.
[35:54.95]So you can get off the board.
[35:58.37]Is it L?
[35:58.55]Get off the board.
[35:59.27]Tap?
[35:59.39]What button is that?
[36:00.39]What?
[36:00.55]What is that like weird moon or like cute?
[36:02.53]What is that?
[36:03.13]What button is that?
[36:24.29]Is it LBs?
[36:27.05]Okay.
[36:27.79]Run and jump over each barrier to get on... Okay, that's left bumper.
[36:34.60]Good job.
[36:36.18]Now jump up while running and then grind on the barrier.
[36:43.02]Jump and... Wait.
[36:44.09]There it is.
[36:46.53]Okay.
[36:49.01]Okay.
[36:52.47]Beating stat challenges will increase your skating abilities.
[36:55.21]Pause the game and go to the view stats menu to see a list of the challenges.
[36:59.05]I think I got those knee pads on.
[37:12.42]Wait, what's that?
[37:16.92]Oh, this is shit to do everywhere.
[37:19.43]What's this one?
[37:20.20]Oh, I gotta put flyers up.
[37:22.22]Chad Muska.
[37:22.70]Why does that name sound fake in 2020?
[37:29.31]You know what I mean?
[37:29.93]Like, Chad Muska.
[37:49.11]The audio is delayed?
[37:50.09]Shouldn't be.
[37:58.20]Is it delayed?
[38:10.18]So you're hearing the sound after I move?
[38:13.59]Well, it should be going click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
[38:24.84]It's not.
[38:25.18]It's barely.
[38:25.64]Fine.
[38:28.56]It's good.
[38:29.06]It's a little delayed.
[38:31.98]The video is slow.
[38:33.22]I don't know why that is.
[38:36.21]Let me try one thing.
[38:46.07]How does this change it?
[38:56.99]Better?
[39:00.31]Fixed?
[39:01.43]Alright.
[39:03.72]Yeah, I just delayed the audio for like 100 milliseconds.
[39:06.64]Alright, let's do it.
[39:07.36]So pick up the flyers.
[39:08.14]Alright, I gotta get back into the Tony Hawk spirit here.
[39:28.11]Oh shit!
[39:28.39]Did I win?
[39:32.81]I think I won.
[39:36.00]Yeah, I'm good.
[39:58.00]I love springs put together.
[39:59.46]Oh, I missed it.
[40:00.88]I missed it.
[40:01.56]Ah, yeah, that was good.
[40:11.44]I'll get you done prancing on and off your board.
[40:13.92]Let's actually escape.
[40:18.18]At least I'm not too gimped to prance.
[40:20.32]How's your knee?
[40:24.03]I'll show you gimped.
[40:24.65]Let's see you land this.
[40:28.82]Do a melon in the drainage ditch.
[40:31.78]Oh, that was fucking pathetic.
[40:39.05]Oh, fuck.
[40:43.47]Oh, there's blood.
[40:45.77]There's blood.
[40:46.37]Do a melon?
[40:47.37]But did I not do a melon?
[40:52.20]I flexed way too hard.
[40:54.70]I flexed too hard.
[40:58.05]Did I not do a melon?
[40:58.59]Okay.
[40:58.69]A melon then revert to R as you land.
[41:01.15]Yeah.
[41:28.11]You see people at the skate park or like the ice skating rinks and anywhere that there's a skill like divide the ground is made out of moving material.
[41:43.91]What's going on?
[41:45.73]What's your score?
[41:46.87]Beat Eric's score.
[41:47.89]We'll give him a head start.
[41:50.61]Ooh, a thousand points.
[41:52.53]What else can you do?
[41:54.49]Wow.
[41:54.65]Really nice, man.
[41:59.90]Oh, I can't keep- I can't like leave the area.
[42:05.48]I'll bait him, don't worry.
[42:20.13]I'm like trying so hard.
[42:33.37]I'm still in the lead.
[42:34.19]Alright, I'm just gonna play.
[42:43.49]Oh shit, Eric's gonna win!
[42:57.78]Let's go.
[43:00.02]Let's go.
[43:00.64]I gave him a head start.
[43:01.52]That was stupid.
[43:19.65]That's enough warming up?
[43:20.57]Alright, let's go.
[43:48.06]Why is he fucking kicking my ass?
[44:04.99]Why is he doing so much better this time?
[44:12.25]And you guys wanted me to do this on sick.
[44:14.25]No fucking way.
[44:23.66]I'm losing to Eric.
[44:28.88]Wait a second.
[44:29.42]Hold on.
[44:29.66]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[44:32.98]I don't have stat points.
[44:35.24]That I didn't put in?
[44:36.02]Dude, lip tricks.
[44:42.48]I don't... It's like holding triangle, right?
[44:45.27]Right at the top?
[44:51.89]Alright, Eric.
[44:52.29]Let's fucking go.
[45:13.51]Okay, come on.
[45:14.15]That's it.
[45:14.76]Enough warming up.
[45:15.94]You can't...
[45:46.48]Whoa.
[45:47.92]He just fucking shot me out of the air.
[45:54.23]Oh my god, I'm like tilting right now.
[46:11.67]Did I win?
[46:13.05]Eric, don't you fucking dare.
[46:22.89]Eric, Eric, why are you so hard?
[46:25.39]What?
[46:25.75]What the fuck, Eric?
[46:31.62]Eric, you're supposed to be the tutorial.
[46:34.60]Eric, you haven't even taught me how to do anything besides a melon grab.
[46:37.27]Why are you trying so hard?
[46:47.73]Imagine doing this on sick difficulty.
[46:49.67]He probably does like a hundred thousand points.
[46:51.99]Fuck, I keep screwing that up.
[46:55.03]You can't just mash.
[47:24.97]Oh my god, I'm not gonna be able to beat Eric.
[47:27.85]I'm not gonna be able to beat Eric on the tutorial.
[47:55.98]I beat Eric.
[47:59.33]I can't believe I almost lost it.
[48:00.91]That was way harder than it should have been.
[48:08.21]I can't believe it took that long to beat Eric.
[48:20.90]Did he get arrested?
[48:36.45]I was going to say, you fucking try to do that line, Eric.
[48:42.37]Also, I have to keep in mind, I'm at zero stats on everything.
[48:46.91]Whoa, Mike V. I knew you were Jersey local, bud.
[48:52.62]Hey, kid.
[48:53.10]Just out skating?
[48:54.30]Cool.
[48:55.08]Me too.
[48:55.88]Hitting up the old neighborhood.
[48:58.16]I think I'm supposed to know who this is.
[48:59.52]Mike V. Want a new trick to practice?
[49:02.92]Get your special meter full, then hit up a flamingo.
[49:05.37]Dang, you're way nicer than fucking Eric was.
[49:22.72]You alright, kid?
[49:24.54]You seem to smash your face on the fucking ground.
[49:27.20]Ugh, alright.
[49:30.33]You know what?
[49:31.25]Can you use an Xbox One controller on the 360?
[49:35.51]Can you use an Xbox One controller on 360?
[49:40.95]God damn it, you can't.
[49:47.59]It's the Xbox controller.
[49:51.52]They're all the same button.
[49:52.72]They're not individual buttons.
[49:55.66]Probably should have thought about that.
[49:59.29]It's all just one huge button on the original Xbox 360 controller.
[50:04.87]See how they're individual?
[50:05.91]God damn it.
[50:07.41]See how these are individual buttons?
[50:11.18]See, like... Can you guys even see?
[50:17.76]I can't use the analog either.
[50:19.52]It's too hard.
[50:21.89]I'll get used to it.
[50:24.29]I never use the analog in any of these games.
[50:34.19]Left, right, B. What?
[50:40.98]You're fucked for real.
[50:42.48]I've never used an analog in a Tony Hawk game.
[50:47.81]I only use the D-pad.
[50:49.25]It's easier to press the buttons.
[51:02.16]Because hitting left and... Nah, it's too hard.
[51:05.34]I'd rather just use the analog.
[51:07.08]It's because of manuals.
[51:12.23]It's harder for me to do a manual than an analog.
[51:13.81]I don't like it.
[51:21.05]It's easier to go tap up and down on the actual buttons.
[51:24.97]Than to have the analog...
[51:28.81]That's why I learned how to play these games with the D-Pad long ago.
[51:32.83]Just because manual is just so much easier.
[51:34.72]Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[51:37.12]Because you can go way too far.
[51:38.36]See how I'm using the analog right now?
[51:40.35]Oh, too much.
[51:49.90]Jeremy, you're nuts.
[51:52.46]I saw one person said, I agree, so I don't care.
[51:59.92]As long as one person agrees with me, what do I care?
[52:02.14]Alright, we need another...
[52:21.80]Oh, I got concrete.
[52:31.20]Okay.
[52:31.90]Looking for... There's somebody.
[52:34.20]I never even got the guy's skateboard back, did I?
[52:37.47]Hey, JT.
[52:39.25]Not out racing today.
[52:44.09]Hey, the kid next door.
[52:45.87]Nah, Charles needs some exercise.
[52:48.68]I'll give you five bucks to run him around the block a couple of times for you.
[52:55.04]Five bucks?
[52:56.20]Wait, what?
[53:09.67]I have to ride the dog?

[54:35.10]Unreal.
[54:36.04]I wonder if anyone could impress him.
[54:40.41]He's checking out the pool by the skate shop.
[54:42.31]Eric, where is that?
[54:43.51]Ow, my ankle.
[54:44.57]Chad, Chad.
[54:44.97]Chad, are you looking?

[55:40.96]He's freaking me out.
[55:41.80]That looks like a good place to skate.
[55:44.10]Here we go.
[55:45.56]I didn't do it?
[55:46.26]30,000 points?
[55:46.58]Fuck.
[55:46.76]40-year-old kid.
[56:03.77]Come on, I can't... Do you think we should call the police or something?
[56:13.48]Or is he gonna be alright?
[56:14.74]He doesn't look like the other kids.
[56:17.58]Alright, Chad, just watch.
[56:52.40]Okay, I know what I have to do.
[56:53.46]Oh, they turned this way.

[57:25.64]I'm just gonna finish the trick in front of him.
[57:27.18]What?
[57:27.36]When did it finish?
[57:54.49]Please escape.
[57:55.31]I'm so desperate for his attention.
[57:58.62]Just give me attention, Chad.
[58:00.84]Please.
[58:01.42]I'm dying over here.
[58:07.16]Just please look at me.
[58:07.82]I'm going to go.
[58:12.86]I'm going to start all the way back here.
[58:16.80]I know he can't see me.
[58:17.86]It doesn't matter.
[58:18.36]I'm going to finish the trick.
[58:20.36]Here we go.
[58:21.19]I need a good line.
[58:31.69]That's only 6,000 points.
[58:33.23]God, the fuck?
[58:41.97]Use the half pipe.
[58:42.73]30k total?
[59:01.06]It's 30k total.
[59:03.83]Not 30k in one trick?
[59:05.79]Is it?
[59:05.99]Yes?
[59:06.19]Hold on, restart it.
[59:06.79]Okay, fine.
[59:10.51]It does.
[59:19.31]Now just... Nice turn.
[59:33.67]Okay, he saw it.
[59:34.40]Good.
[60:08.79]He's not even looking?
[60:12.41]I'm in- I just was in front of the car!
[60:14.97]I was just standing in front of the car.
[60:21.57]Not bad, not bad.
[60:25.69]That looks like a good place to skate.
[60:28.72]Yes it does, Chad.
[60:31.64]I'm losing my mind here.
[60:43.70]That was 10,000 points.
[60:47.33]Yeah, that looks like a good place to skate, man.
[60:49.39]Okay, I'm laughing.
[60:50.85]This is too funny.
[60:51.85]Okay.
[61:10.58]Hey, what's up, man?
[61:11.20]That was a sick line you had back there.
[61:13.32]Whoa, Chad Muska?
[61:14.72]I'm a huge fan.
[61:15.90]Whoa, Chad Muska.
[61:17.20]Holy shit.
[61:17.86]Dang, man.
[61:18.36]That's some ghetto ride you got rolling, though.
[61:20.18]I can't believe you noticed me.
[61:21.30]Yeah, but I'm pretty broke.
[61:23.04]I gotta make it last.
[61:24.84]I hear you, man.
[61:25.74]Back in Vegas, I had no money, no place to stay, nothing, man.
[61:29.32]Until my first shop sponsor hooked me up.
[61:31.36]So why don't you head down to your shop, check out that rider, and try to get hooked up.
[61:34.28]I thought there was a Christmas present in his front seat.
[61:35.64]I was like, wow.
[61:36.16]And yo...
[61:37.96]Merry Christmas.
[61:39.08]It is.
[61:39.60]Thank you.
[61:39.96]Thanks.
[61:45.96]Mr. Peralta's not here right now, but if you want to be sponsored by a skate shop, you'll need to impress the riders on his team.
[61:51.76]If you get us to sign off on you, you're in.
[61:53.98]Okay.
[62:01.78]Alright.
[62:02.04]Bernie O'Vine is doing pretty good.
[62:06.26]Chapter 2, Impressing the Locals.
[62:13.05]What's up?
[62:13.37]Let's see what you can do.
[62:14.57]Let's see what I can do.
[62:38.91]Why don't I have a private... Why don't I have a private lane?
[62:45.32]Why are you people standing here?
[62:47.08]I'm taking out all the competition.
[62:51.54]Oh, okay.
[62:52.50]I need 20,000 points.
[62:53.29]Everyone's watching you.
[62:54.27]Let me see if they saw the fucked up thing I just did.
[63:04.19]Jesus.
[63:04.49]Yep.
[63:04.59]I am a local.
[63:05.29]Good stats increase.
[63:06.63]You're Chris' best line.
[63:46.39]It took me six months to hit that line.
[63:48.81]Well, whatever, probably a fluke.
[63:51.24]See if you can hit this.
[63:52.20]There's this crazy line.
[63:58.64]That's a broken neck in two places.
[64:17.02]End it, end it, end it, end it.
[64:21.74]Alright, let's go.
[64:30.95]I gotta impress all the locals.
[64:34.25]Why's all the gas coming out of here?
[64:43.38]I heard, yo skater.
[64:54.35]Why am I a charging bull?
[64:57.01]How much do I weigh?
[64:58.96]Am I a train?
[65:04.97]Impress Sean.
[65:05.65]Impress Joey.
[65:06.51]Impress Sean.
[65:09.15]Let's see if you got the cojones.
[65:10.35]Oh, I can just go right to them.
[65:12.31]Meet me on the roof.
[65:13.51]Use the quarter pipe to get up to roof height, then hold left and jump off your board onto the roof.
[65:17.85]That seems like a lot of exp... Jump onto the roof, and then get off your board while jumping up onto the roof.
[65:28.43]Nicely done.
[65:29.77]Now I want you to transfer between the houses.
[65:32.01]Do we even live in these houses?
[65:33.60]To transfer, come down the ramp and angle yourself so your jump carries you across the space between the houses.
[65:41.54]Oh.
[65:42.32]Oh, and careful you don't overshoot.
[65:44.56]I don't want to have to scrape you off of Elm Street.
[65:46.41]Transfer over the alley?
[65:49.03]Who wants me to... Do you just feel pain?
[66:05.46]I kind of don't understand what he wants me to do.
[66:10.31]Transfer over to get off the board and then jump up and then get on?
[66:16.95]No.
[66:22.22]Oh, I know what he wants me to do.
[66:25.32]Okay.
[66:25.52]Nice.
[66:26.28]Now spine back down and I'll tell Mr. Peralta you've got skills.
[66:31.12]Skate up the quarter pipe catch air spine transfer and land in the quarter pipe below Skate up the quarter pipe catch air spine transfer and land in the quarter pipe Spine transfer
[67:01.25]That's not it?
[67:03.17]Where did it go?
[67:04.97]Stop, stop, stop, where are you?
[67:09.63]Why is it spawning me here?
[67:10.65]I don't know, what is it?
[67:16.08]Okay, spine transfer is that.
[67:17.20]Spine transfer is you just go forward.
[67:19.42]They're using these terms like I should know where they are.
[67:29.63]Mongo, Spine Transfer, Goofy.
[67:32.05]I don't know what these things are.
[67:33.05]So just run in.
[67:35.05]I weigh like 6,000 pounds.
[67:35.63]Just run everybody over.
[67:55.81]Looks like I'm gonna have to sneak over to Elm Street and get it back.
[67:58.94]I must be nuts.
[68:00.32]They're all over the neighborhood.
[68:02.04]Most of them are pretty fried, so it should be easy to stay out of earshot.
[68:05.48]But they're unpredictable and dangerous.
[68:07.52]Where's the school?
[68:08.76]Like, where's the school?
[68:10.40]It's in my neighborhood.
[68:11.66]I'll do it.
[68:12.72]What is going on in this neighborhood?
[68:18.54]We have to, like, fight crackheads?
[68:24.25]Wait, kid!
[68:25.04]It's too dangerous!
[68:53.46]It's an actual stealth section.
[68:55.06]Oh.
[69:30.02]What?
[69:37.92]How am I supposed to get by them?
[69:39.31]Around this way?
[69:55.84]Where is it?
[70:03.09]Was that The Simpsons?
[70:20.06]I'm gonna go back.
[70:20.90]No.
[70:21.02]Use the wires?
[70:21.90]I just tried.
[70:22.24]What do you mean the wires?
[70:26.14]What?
[70:30.67]You want me to tightrope walk on the wire?
[70:32.37]I can't grab him.
[70:33.88]I just... Power lines?
[70:38.24]Didn't I just grab them and fall?
[70:44.04]Just go straight on the roof.
[70:55.12]Wait, why can I do this?
[71:06.09]This would kill somebody.
[71:07.97]You die if you do this.
[71:17.11]If I make any connection with anything... Yeah, I know birds do.
[71:23.52]I'm saying, like... Can I get... I could get fucking hurt doing this.
[71:39.45]All lines can't kill you, but electric lines can.
[71:42.45]If you touch any other thing, you die.
[71:44.55]Wait, Eric's... Is Eric... Is Eric doing drugs?
[72:07.11]Oh, no, Eric is doing arson.
[72:18.54]I'm looking for the owner, Mr. Peralta.
[72:21.62]Wait, are you THE Stacy Peralta?
[72:24.48]That's me.
[72:26.06]You the guy my skaters have been talking about?
[72:28.34]Well, I hope so.
[72:29.70]I'd like to be sponsored by your shop.
[72:32.10]Yeah, so would everybody else.
[72:33.46]I'll tell you what.
[72:35.39]Make me a sponsor me video.
[72:37.35]Show me what makes you different than Bobby B down the street.
[72:39.70]I can't wait to make a sponsor me video.
[72:41.18]And please don't hand me anything from the same old spots in New Jersey, dude, because I've seen it all.
[72:46.04]Done.
[72:47.84]No local spots and different tricks.
[72:52.22]Dude, I just talked to Stacey Crawford.
[72:55.78]They know.
[72:57.04]Those gangsters know it was me.
[72:59.31]What are you talking about?
[73:00.89]When I got back to my house last night, they were parked outside waiting for me.
[73:04.91]I've seen all the local tricks, all the spots.
[73:07.99]I haven't seen somebody put their tongue into an outlet.
[73:10.23]It couldn't work for me.
[73:12.86]Alright, here we go.
[73:27.36]Getting out of...
[73:29.83]Eric, you okay?
[73:31.13]I think we lost him.
[73:32.27]Who is this guy?
[73:35.23]We gotta get out of here.
[73:36.47]If they find me, it'll be my name on this headstone.
[73:39.05]I'm hiding here with Headstone Harry.
[73:40.53]Headstone Harry.
[73:43.72]But if we bring him some scrap metal, he says he'll bang us out our ramp.
[73:47.08]And if we can get it set up, the street warriors say they'll give us a tow to get speed.
[73:53.36]The drug dealers were after him.
[73:56.24]Alright, I gotta get the scrap metal.
[74:00.48]Press A and jump and grab.
[74:01.64]Alright, scrap metal, let's go.
[74:03.74]Something on the floor.
[74:07.87]Scrap, scrap, scrap.
[74:12.05]Let's probably get off the board.
[74:16.33]Jump and grab.
[74:17.03]What am I, up here?
[74:18.17]On the roof?
[74:26.31]How many do I need?
[74:26.93]Six?
[74:29.07]Three.
[74:32.33]Where are the others?
[74:35.99]Oh, still here.
[74:40.86]Big jump.
[74:46.60]That move over there.
[74:51.93]Didn't work, but it's alright.
[74:58.13]Need to get to the other side of the bridge, huh?
[75:00.31]No problem.
[75:01.33]Those pigs can't stop us.
[75:03.25]Grab the back of my ride and I'll get you up to speed.
[75:05.82]Clear the bridge?
[75:09.74]Okay, let's go.
[75:12.54]Don't let go till I tell you.
[75:14.69]Hit L and R if you want to switch sides.
[75:43.27]Why do I... I don't even switch sides.
[75:52.09]Ready?
[75:52.45]Steady?
[76:01.74]Alright, how do you let go?
[76:08.94]Is it just up again?
[76:10.24]Is it down?
[76:11.56]Alright, it's down.
[76:23.95]Holy shit!
[76:24.89]No skater punks allowed in this station.
[76:26.65]How would I land that?
[76:27.65]Do I have a parachute?
[76:50.05]Whoa.
[76:50.37]Holy shit.
[77:20.66]Make Stu chase you three times around the circle.
[77:37.34]Did I kill him?
[77:45.67]Okay, well we killed the security guard.
[77:51.99]Yes?
[77:52.17]Keep going.
[77:52.75]Alright.
[77:54.19]Can't be on the street.
[78:12.58]Get 25,000 points.
[78:12.94]Don't touch the street.
[78:13.56]I got this.
[78:14.16]End it.
[78:14.32]Oh, I thought I could end it.
[78:40.32]End it.
[78:41.28]Oh, just end it!
[78:42.01]End the trick!
[78:46.48]Oh, I can end it right there.
[79:09.32]There it is.
[79:10.42]No, it's not it.
[79:11.46]Shit.
[79:11.98]Fuck.
[79:12.32]Shit.
[79:12.80]Fuck.
[79:13.10]Shit.
[79:13.82]Um.
[79:13.94]No, you idiot.
[79:19.66]I was trying to...
[79:36.55]I was trying to do a lit trick.
[79:40.69]Turn the music up.
[79:41.29]The music is as loud as it can go.
[79:42.47]I think it's just bad mixing.
[79:49.59]Back to the hangout.
[79:50.41]Wait, they took Eric?
[79:52.03]Hold on.
[79:52.41]Yeah, look.
[79:55.35]I'm pretty sure it's off as loud as it can go.
[79:56.81]Maybe it's not.
[80:00.01]I had it in reverse.
[80:12.83]alright we're gonna taste them hey Eric look at the look out the back window
[80:41.53]Can I go faster?
[80:42.15]Oh, come on, the one... Stupid, what the fuck is that even there for?
[81:14.87]Come here.
[81:20.23]Who are these people?
[81:22.69]There's a car in this game.
[81:25.23]Okay, that took me back a little.
[81:43.70]There's a car.
[81:45.30]Good.
[81:45.61]It's at full letter grade.
[81:53.95]That much is certain.
[82:02.74]No.
[82:02.86]Alright, Brian.
[82:07.72]Imagine you could jump in for that.
[82:10.22]That'd be so stupid.
[82:12.15]Feels like a Disney game.
[82:15.50]Rescue Eric.
[82:16.08]Got it.
[82:20.42]That's one way to rescue somebody.
[82:26.92]Quick, get on the train!
[82:35.54]That's Mario Kart.
[82:37.64]You can't grind in Mario Kart.
[82:38.90]Now we're in Manhattan.
[82:51.12]Are we actually going to make a video?
[82:53.36]I hope I get to edit the video.
[82:54.96]Where are your parents?
[82:55.68]Well, in the lore, I am the parent.
[82:56.59]This character's 40.
[82:57.33]So, you're looking at him.
[83:20.56]Skate to Big Apple.
[83:24.96]I'll find it.
[83:27.08]I'm a student.
[83:27.88]Okay.
[83:41.56]Here we go.
[84:01.90]No.
[84:02.12]Can I actually get up there from... Oh, wait.
[84:03.82]Get on the board.
[84:04.61]Oh, okay.
[84:04.99]Okay, I restarted.

[85:40.40]Uh, there's one over there.
[85:42.14]Three.
[85:42.38]Where?

[85:43.50]Where?
[85:44.42]Where?

[86:04.61]Okay, I should get it.
[86:05.39]Wrong way.
[86:05.69]Oof.
[86:27.16]Last one's this way.
[86:28.20]I gotta get all the way up there.
[86:29.58]Okay, I know what to do.
[86:44.52]I gotta grind on that bar.
[86:46.12]Why does it have to be this many fucking cars?
[86:48.40]How many cars have to come down this tiny little fucking road?
[86:51.42]They're probably saying the same thing about me, too.
[86:53.98]I didn't even jump.
[87:16.41]Have to do it from here.
[87:24.96]Oh, I had it!
[87:25.58]I just... He didn't grab it.
[87:26.96]No!
[87:28.12]I had it too.
[87:28.94]Shit!
[87:32.70]Nope, I'm dead.
[87:39.33]No!
[87:41.07]Whatever.
[87:43.87]Do it again.
[87:53.15]Uh, number two.
[87:53.83]Here we go.
[88:01.09]Alright.
[88:01.63]I'm letting go of the Ollie 2 way too late, apparently.
[88:04.46]I don't know why.
[88:05.66]What's the song name?
[88:15.13]Uh... I don't know.
[88:25.79]Pause for the song then, hold on.
[88:40.85]Little lips.
[88:41.35]I can just grab it, can't I?
[88:46.39]Can I just jump and grab the damn thing?
[88:50.52]Do this.
[88:58.80]Do I get it?
[88:59.36]Yeah.
[89:02.54]Song is... Crush Em by GBH.
[89:08.27]Crush Em.
[89:15.74]Wrong way.
[89:25.30]Get off the board.
[89:25.82]I'm gonna go this way.
[89:34.95]Yeah, this one's gonna be so hard for me to get.
[89:36.59]It's gonna be angled.
[89:38.86]Tiny little lips.
[89:47.56]No, I want to grind it.
[89:52.34]I want to stop doing- I want to grind the fucking rail.
[89:58.73]Thank you.
[89:59.19]There it is.
[90:11.23]Yes!
[90:19.40]Alright, who's next?
[90:20.42]You.
[90:20.66]No, you.
[90:21.24]What song is this?
[90:22.06]It's Braggin' Rights.
[90:45.02]This ain't Jersey, kid.
[90:47.18]Let's see your tech skills.
[90:49.16]Combine the grind combos by holding grind down in between the gap and the benches.
[90:54.38]Tapping a different direction before you hit the next bench will change your grind.
[90:59.44]Old grind combos.
[91:12.75]Up and Y and then Y?
[91:15.10]Y and then down Y. Can you make the game louder a smidge?
[91:19.26]Go!
[91:19.44]What about you?
[91:20.02]It's QP.
[91:20.34]I don't know what that term is.
[91:42.81]Get a QP on this M5O.
[91:47.10]Oh wait, that's Chad Muska.
[91:48.94]He's just hanging out over here.
[91:50.34]Alright.
[91:52.72]Get special on this quarter pipe, then do a moonwalk 5-0.
[91:55.36]I'm gonna die.
[91:58.44]Get special and moonwalk 5-0 the waterfront.
[92:11.85]Uh, down, left, wide.
[92:12.80]I died.
[92:32.56]I don't have a special anymore.
[92:35.13]Damn it.
[93:02.79]God damn small I Didn't do it
[93:32.28]Is this it?
[93:33.34]No, it's down, left, Y. Down, left, Y.
[94:03.36]Alright, slow down a little.
[94:04.40]Down left.
[94:04.60]Okay, here we go.
[94:05.04]Down left, left.
[94:35.45]Don't fall in.
[94:38.19]Oh no, that guy.
[94:39.67]That guy was doing the same quest.
[94:43.60]Fuck!
[94:44.86]It's alright, I'll get it.
[95:03.55]That poor guy was doing the same thing.
[95:06.23]We're all trying to impress the same guy.
[95:08.29]I'm not going fast enough.
[95:12.81]Look at how bad this is.
[95:25.70]Hey, be careful, man.
[95:26.50]Watch out for the bodies in there.
[95:29.86]People keep trying to impress me and they keep getting fucking killed in there.
[95:32.83]You keep killing each other.
[95:34.65]Radical.
[95:50.63]That's not a bad deal.
[95:54.03]But I don't really want to do that.
[95:56.59]Why?
[95:57.45]Destroy the competing... This is a car mission.
[96:03.30]Why is this car so low?
[96:04.52]This is like... I feel like it's not even a car.
[96:06.36]This is freaking me out.
[96:08.68]I feel like the car's inside the ground.
[96:29.08]I didn't mean to.
[96:30.06]Okay, uh... I'm not sure we're going to be doing it this time.
[96:35.37]I think I have a good line here.
[96:36.61]This is seven of these.
[96:40.59]That restarted.
[97:01.53]I got time.
[97:03.07]I got time.
[97:04.99]Ahhhh, that arrow fucked my head.
[97:09.63]It's hit and run all over again.
[97:10.85]It's like the same driving mechanics as hit and run.
[97:12.86]Where's the left?
[97:13.42]I'm getting time.
[97:21.06]That's good.
[97:38.89]Wait, where is he?
[97:49.78]Why do you have to shop in an alley?
[97:59.23]That doesn't seem like the smartest place to get business.
[98:05.56]Form it!
[98:05.80]Go get your free nuts.
[98:08.93]For 45,000, get us anywhere?
[98:09.65]Or do I have to be in here?
[98:10.65]45,000?
[98:10.67]Does it matter?
[98:11.19]Back to the score mission.
[98:12.21]Ah, my knee!
[98:34.47]I'm gonna do this line here.
[98:35.95]I just grew.
[98:49.10]You see how I just got taller?
[98:52.64]That's weird.
[99:02.42]Alright, Bernie Bovine doing good so far.
[99:14.38]Those guys have a camera.
[99:16.02]Maybe they'll let us use it to make our Sponsor Me video for Peralta.
[99:19.82]Why you beaming?
[99:20.86]You want to date or something?
[99:22.72]I can't wait to impress the fuck out of these guys.
[99:25.43]Take your soggy mob flips back to Jersey, tweakers.
[99:28.67]Hey, let's just go skate.
[99:30.79]If we tear up your favorite spots... Excuse me, the proper term is crackhead.
[99:48.82]Alright, I'm gonna impress the locals, and then they finally will let me use their video camera.
[99:55.04]Alley switch, coming up!
[100:01.75]I get it, I get it.
[100:19.50]Trying to get up on the bridge.
[100:28.19]Alright, what do you got for me?
[100:29.65]Some fun?
[100:31.75]Can you help me out?
[100:32.41]I need to get some footage of this kid and my camera's busted.
[100:35.60]He's risking his life on this line, so don't blow it.
[100:37.60]Can you help me?
[100:38.06]I need to get some footage of this kid.
[100:42.66]Film the locals.
[100:43.48]Stay close.
[101:05.34]That works.
[101:16.57]But isn't somebody filming me filming him?
[101:21.79]Don't, don't, don't... Come on, I gotta get a big drop into a switch with a transfer, come on.
[101:34.03]Don't fall.
[101:35.17]Hold on.
[101:35.45]This is the best part of my 20-up.
[101:37.01]I can do shit like this.
[101:42.14]You know exactly what I was trying to do there.
[101:44.08]Just pretend I didn't.
[101:58.27]Holy shit, dude.
[101:59.23]That was fucking awesome.
[102:04.07]Alright, we need them to miss it.
[102:05.15]What do you got?
[102:05.97]This is a line?
[102:07.31]It's a bunch of cars.
[102:08.05]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[102:09.35]Hit the killer line combo.
[102:11.42]Wait, why didn't we start?
[102:13.14]We weren't even ready.
[102:33.12]Oh wait, okay, hold on, start over.
[102:38.60]What?
[102:46.41]That was, that was, still in the combo.
[102:48.87]There we go.
[103:03.72]I need more speed than this.
[103:05.06]Do I have to start on the car?
[103:16.83]I have to end on that.
[104:04.20]I'm so mad, I can't fucking believe anything I did.
[104:18.15]Dude, I'm telling you, this lift thing is fucking me so hard.
[104:21.01]Like, it's just ruining me.
[104:22.57]It's fucking me up.
[104:25.61]It's fucking me up.
[104:27.43]So bad.
[104:29.07]That, like, I'm doing- I'm timing it wrong.
[104:35.66]Help me out and help me get some killer footage for Stacey.
[104:37.60]Remember how to decide who's building this?
[104:38.80]Okay.
[104:39.02]Is this family friendly?
[104:41.36]What?
[104:41.48]Here comes the meltdown.
[104:42.43]No, I just... I gotta get that lip better.
[104:48.25]Because I'm doing it too early or too late.
[104:49.79]It's like that little window.
[105:00.35]Alright, let's go.
[105:01.87]I'm getting nuts for life.
[105:02.87]I don't understand.
[105:03.91]Here.
[105:04.07]Now I have to keep getting... Oh, okay.
[105:32.07]Hurry.
[105:39.22]Where's his guard?
[105:44.76]Guard up here.
[105:58.43]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[106:25.39]There's a security guard this way.
[106:27.07]I thought I had something left.
[106:37.12]What's with this place and nuts?
[106:40.02]You guys have anything else to talk about here?
[106:54.95]Yeah, we just fucking love nuts in New York.
[106:56.25]Get special and then nut-bust inside the building.
[106:59.11]Wait.
[106:59.75]Oh.
[106:59.91]Okay, I got a special nut-bust.
[107:32.07]Can I even get back in?
[107:34.90]Uh, does it count as in the building?
[108:01.13]I'm sure you can make that trick even better.
[108:02.91]It's the rocket ship.
[108:06.95]Create a trick welcome.
[108:08.11]In Tony Hawk Underground, you can create your own tricks.
[108:11.22]The trick timeline shows the components of the trick you just landed.
[108:14.18]Tweak it or make a whole new trick and map it to your skater.
[108:20.08]Let's go.
[108:25.09]Front flip spin.
[108:32.27]How do I delete this?
[108:37.15]Uh, delete.
[108:38.36]Delete.
[108:38.64]Okay, it's gone.
[108:43.84]Uh, edit.
[108:59.91]Alright.
[109:02.17]0.5 seconds seems pretty good.
[109:03.06]Okay, and then right after that, I want a new trick.
[109:26.24]Slow, you go into slow motion.
[109:30.26]More rotation.
[109:32.03]Yeah, so just do like 6,000 front flips in like 3 seconds?
[109:34.89]In 2 seconds?
[109:36.13]Yeah, hold on.
[109:37.99]Get rid of this.
[109:38.95]Uh, rotation.
[109:43.79]Roll.
[109:43.99]Roll.
[109:58.50]Okay.
[110:00.38]Another one?
[110:11.85]The spin!
[110:12.37]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[110:14.17]That's so stupid.
[110:18.22]Okay, no, no, no.
[110:18.84]I want it to be...
[110:27.43]This is just a Sonic the Hedgehog card.
[110:45.83]Do you do sound?
[111:02.28]No, I'm not doing the fart sound guys
[111:37.91]Special.
[112:10.35]Okay, I can't even... What's happening in here?
[112:15.59]This is what happens when you attach 10 thrusters to somebody in a Garry's Mod multiplayer game.
[112:25.41]No, no, no, no, no.
[112:38.63]No, it's too much.
[112:40.76]I can't even see what the fuck's going on.
[112:45.64]No, how do I get back?
[112:50.36]No, I don't delete it.
[112:51.06]I want another one of those super spins.
[113:19.28]What's happening at the end?
[113:27.55]Wait, hold on.
[113:28.07]What about this?
[113:28.85]That's good.
[113:30.35]Alright, that's good.
[113:32.69]Done!
[113:33.05]Done?
[113:44.98]Is it saved?
[113:45.60]More sounds.
[113:45.96]I can only have three sounds.
[114:14.93]Fine.
[114:16.07]You get what you want.
[114:16.77]Okay.
[114:19.53]Trick done?
[114:20.15]Name the trick.
[114:21.77]Preview trick.
[114:25.28]Oh my god.
[114:38.22]Oh my god, dude.
[114:42.88]I'm going to accidentally do this so many times.
[114:45.56]I can't put it on X. It's got to be way quicker than that.
[114:57.05]How long is it?
[114:57.63]Two seconds?
[115:00.61]It's too long.
[115:04.79]Let me see if I can even do this.
[115:25.74]I don't think it's possible to land.
[115:29.14]It's gotta be faster.
[115:30.98]Holy shit, I just did it!
[115:37.56]Oh no, this whole place just got ruined.
[115:49.85]Rename it?
[116:02.03]Okay.
[116:03.43]Name trick.
[116:08.87]Hyper flush.
[116:17.48]Hyper drain.
[116:18.22]Hyper flush.
[116:18.90]The drain.
[116:22.44]The drain.
[116:34.61]This is on a kickflip.
[116:37.29]This replaced kickflip.
[116:40.92]The royal flush.
[116:47.48]This whole playthrough just got destroyed because now I'm just going to make fucked up tricks for every move and never going to be able to finish the game.
[117:08.93]The royal flush.
[117:09.71]Save the trick.
[117:11.95]Royal flush.
[117:17.95]Okay.
[117:24.19]It's gotta be... Hold on.
[117:25.77]Back to editor.
[117:38.24]Okay.
[117:46.28]Let's try that.
[117:53.87]Now it looks like you actually use it.
[118:15.09]Add a scream.
[118:19.71]There's no scream.
[118:39.15]There's no scream, guys.
[118:46.77]Alright, we got it.
[118:50.53]Keep this... Create a trick.
[118:51.79]Once kept, a created trick can be permanently mapped to your skater from the tricks menu.
[118:55.06]Yes.
[118:58.34]Okay.
[118:59.20]Let's create a new trick.
[119:12.66]Nope.
[119:23.95]Holdable?
[119:31.90]Airwalk.
[119:33.56]Oh, that's pretty sick.
[119:38.40]Hold on.
[119:39.25]What else we got?
[119:39.71]Alright, we're gonna do airwalk.
[119:45.92]air walk is gonna be long.
[119:50.50]Like, we're just gonna stick our legs out, make it fall three seconds.
[119:54.04]Bang.
[119:57.52]Is it not holdable?
[119:58.26]No.
[119:58.84]So, in the middle of this, boom, right when the foot comes out, you can do this.
[120:08.23]Flip trick.
[120:09.11]You don't have any room.
[120:09.91]What?
[120:12.55]Oh.
[120:14.03]Can't do it for that long.
[120:17.47]Alright, right when the foot comes out.
[120:19.19]Boom.
[120:20.99]Boom.
[120:22.03]New part.
[120:23.21]Gotta be quicker than that.
[120:24.95]Bang.
[120:25.57]Foot comes out.
[120:30.36]Into a... Boom.
[120:35.76]Boom.
[120:46.00]Hold on, wait.
[120:47.57]Check this out.
[121:03.81]Hold on.
[121:06.07]Oh, I can't.
[121:06.75]I can't.
[121:07.33]I can't do it.
[121:12.07]No, never mind.
[121:12.84]Not a flip trick.
[121:15.69]into well let's see when we have a rotation like spinning oh that's kind of cool that's also pretty cool that's pretty cool too oh that's tricky
[121:43.31]No, no.
[121:43.97]I don't like it.
[121:45.67]Something else.
[121:47.01]Other.
[121:49.49]Well.
[121:50.77]A handstand.
[121:54.67]What is a casper?
[122:01.56]Truck stand.
[122:07.56]The faction.
[122:18.63]You just play the guitar?
[122:48.02]Wrong, wrong, wrong.
[122:48.78]Stop, stop.
[123:00.47]I don't need this to beat.
[123:08.52]Another one?
[123:09.02]Oh, I can only have three sounds.
[123:10.18]Alright, let's check it out.
[123:17.75]Boy, why is it playing...
[123:33.75]It already has a sound effect built into it.
[123:35.88]It already has a sound effect built into it.
[123:42.82]Get this fucking thing out of here.
[123:44.98]What is this?
[123:45.40]It's called the American Flag Slam Bam?
[124:03.81]Alright, this is a fall joke.
[124:05.22]I like this.
[124:28.88]It's got to be a little backwards.
[124:30.56]You're going to have a backwards that you bounce off.
[124:35.01]No, you're going to bounce back.
[124:39.07]Okay.
[124:39.85]It's too long.
[124:40.87]Three seconds is a long time.
[124:44.10]Anything more than two seconds is almost impossible without huge air.
[124:47.20]Okay.
[124:52.64]One second should be alright.
[124:56.48]Then I'll go to other as well.
[124:58.56]What else we got?
[125:04.16]Handstand?
[125:06.66]Handstand and then falling off the board.
[125:15.11]Do it again, but backwards.
[125:16.45]What's cheer?
[125:20.13]Anything ending in the fall.
[125:22.01]This is going to fuck me up because I'm going to think I fell off the board.
[125:33.20]Slap.
[125:50.14]It's like I'm getting hit with projectiles.
[125:52.34]Alright, yeah.
[125:53.72]This is the people are throwing objects at me trick.
[125:57.31]You got it.
[126:09.37]How does it look?
[126:23.95]Alright, I like it.
[126:32.82]That's good.
[126:33.22]A little bit shorter.
[126:39.71]Yeah, that's a wall.
[126:41.65]I've lost control.
[126:42.82]Yep.
[126:43.58]Right there.
[126:46.40]Yeah, okay.
[126:46.94]So somebody throws a rock at me.
[126:47.92]It hits me right in the chest.
[126:48.82]Bang.
[126:49.40]I'm losing control.
[126:50.32]Falling off the board.
[126:53.56]Yeah, I have to add the moan.
[126:55.86]Because it's like... Let me edit this.
[127:06.37]Hold on.
[127:20.40]I actually kind of like it a little longer.
[127:33.53]It's got a flow animation-wise.
[127:40.30]There it is.
[127:40.64]A little bit longer.
[127:53.80]Where does it actually end if you do it back here?
[127:57.42]Ah, it's going to be the full fall.
[128:03.26]Yeah, because then you get back up.
[128:06.61]A little bit further out at the start.
[128:08.01]A little bit further, I think.
[128:11.25]Let's see.
[128:13.75]Maybe further?
[128:16.61]No.
[128:17.25]I actually like it taking out his legs.
[128:19.91]Actually...
[128:22.85]Yeah, that's much better.
[128:23.79]Okay, let's take a look at the slap.
[128:46.20]Why the fuck am I doing this like this?
[128:49.02]Alright, that's fine.
[128:54.05]I like how it rips his arm kind of back a little.
[128:57.25]There we go.
[129:02.19]Okay, now we have to add... Okay, so that's bang right there.
[129:13.24]And then there's... Is there like a crashing sound?
[129:18.56]okay that actually I don't think I want that there do a fart at the land you guys are killing me with the fart shit
[129:55.19]Let's test it.
[129:58.19]I don't think it's gonna work out.
[130:00.15]Oh my knee!
[130:00.65]What?
[130:23.10]No, this has to be way shorter than this.
[130:26.30]How long is this trick?
[130:28.46]Nope.
[130:28.78]No way.
[130:29.32]It's gonna be way shorter.
[130:30.56]Oh, it's because it's two full seconds.
[130:32.66]That's way too long.
[131:14.67]That was one and a half seconds?
[131:24.18]Okay.
[131:26.75]That's right.
[131:50.04]Why is the sound not playing?
[131:51.68]Just got him shorter.
[131:53.26]It's still too long.
[131:54.66]I think I have to remove this lap.
[131:57.66]Make it a grind.
[132:20.81]Can I do that?
[132:25.52]Rotation grab flip special.
[132:27.52]How do I do that?
[132:29.38]I can't make it a grind.
[132:31.60]No, I can't.
[132:33.74]Oh, well.
[132:35.64]Alright, let's try that.
[132:57.54]Can I please get rid of the fart sound?
[133:00.31]Can I get rid of the fart?
[133:01.91]This is turning into another crack game.
[133:29.98]Okay.
[133:31.60]Let's go.
[133:31.96]I'm ready.
[133:35.66]Edit tricks.
[133:39.20]Edit tricks.
[133:40.74]Grab tricks.
[133:43.16]So, right and B is indie stiffy right now.
[133:47.40]We're going to make it Royal Flush.
[133:59.14]Is it a grab trick?
[134:01.69]Is the, wait, is the Royal Flush a grab trick or is it a kickflip?
[134:11.28]Wait, I need, oh, I need to be, it has to be special.
[134:18.44]Doesn't matter.
[134:20.65]Alright, well then, I'll, I don't want it to be, I want Indie.
[134:30.33]Alright, what we got down here?
[134:31.15]Down, down, B is going to be the one.
[134:35.89]The royal flush.
[134:37.95]And then the other one's a kickflip, so it's a flip trick.
[134:41.75]We'll just make that be left, left.
[134:48.00]Or whoops.
[134:49.94]Okay.
[134:54.80]So now, are we just back out?
[134:56.22]Let's see if I can make sure I got it right.
[134:58.56]I'm never going to be able to do that.
[135:01.24]No way.
[135:01.60]In any in-game scenario.
[135:04.01]Okay.
[135:27.37]Music's so loud.

[138:06.43]One guy.
[138:07.03]One guy.
[138:07.41]Dude, come on, dude.
[138:08.63]One guy.
[138:08.96]One guy.
[138:09.60]One guy.
[138:25.18]This song is so good.
[138:26.32]One guy.
[138:26.96]This song is so bad.
[138:27.94]One guy.
[138:30.86]I think this song is just right.
[138:32.78]One guy.
[138:33.26]I need to do... I can't... I cannot make it across.
[138:42.53]I have to just go across and do the big one.
[138:45.11]It's too hard to jump and do anything else.
[138:49.01]It's that.
[138:49.41]There you go.
[138:52.23]No.
[138:52.67]I can't even do it.
[138:53.19]It's not possible.
[138:53.93]I don't have enough jump right now.
[138:58.20]I think this song is like Cactus, one guy.

[139:38.01]We've got to find a way to get you down to the Tampa Am contest.
[139:40.75]Tampa?
[139:41.57]That would be insane.
[139:43.89]But I have like three bucks to my name.
[139:45.29]Why do I have yellow gloves on?
[139:47.08]I'll tell you what.
[139:48.44]You run some errands for me in New York and I'll flow you my vintage bus for the trip.
[139:52.42]But tell me what you want to ride and I'll send you all the free gear you need for the event, dude.
[139:57.32]I got a new outfit.
[139:59.54]Free gear from Peralta is now available in Skate Shop.
[140:01.92]You can now return to the Skate Shop from the Edit Skater menu.
[140:05.32]Dex.
[140:08.00]Ooh, hold on.
[140:14.44]Almost.
[140:16.12]Alright, so I do the Almond Joy.
[140:17.84]Baker.
[140:19.64]I think I like Almond Joy.
[140:25.09]Sorry.
[140:27.01]Yeah, I like the Almond Joy one.
[140:32.79]Alright, grip tape.
[140:34.71]Uh, grip tape.
[140:36.37]Solid.
[140:38.69]This just looks like something fucked up.
[140:40.13]I don't like it.
[140:42.25]Ooh!
[140:43.23]Like the molten lava one.
[140:45.67]Yeah.
[140:47.25]Grip tape color.
[140:48.95]Rain.
[140:53.14]The grip tape froze.
[140:54.12]No.
[140:54.84]I'm a pro.
[140:56.34]Oh, it has to be black, right.
[140:58.76]Alright, that's fine.
[140:59.65]That looks good.
[141:02.35]Wheel color.
[141:08.03]That, like, bright blue.
[141:08.87]We just did Poker Table Green.
[141:24.65]No, I didn't.
[141:25.11]Whatever.
[141:25.91]Astro Turf Green.
[141:29.67]Bovine Ernie.
[141:33.42]That's a Boomer board.
[141:35.52]Whatever.
[141:36.98]Favors for a ride.
[141:46.05]Oh, you?
[141:47.23]Turn it up.
[141:48.45]I'm not going to turn it up.
[141:49.71]It's in a perfect spot.
[141:51.17]Okay, no comply five times.
[142:17.90]How did I even pop that up?
[142:23.86]Jump over an obstacle.
[142:25.36]I do manual and then flip trick out.
[142:45.46]manual no comply onto the no comply into a manual on the bench and flip trick out soon we will fuse the boneless into modern skating but first you must practice remember the boneless will give you extra height and distance boneless
[143:20.85]Normally this wall would be almost impossible to jump over.
[143:23.79]You can jump over with a boneless.
[143:25.41]It's a simple task.
[143:30.33]This will be the ultimate fusion of new and old.
[143:33.73]Get some speed and boneless off the lip of this quarter pipe.
[143:37.83]This should give you enough air to do a huge vertrick.
[143:42.45]Accomplishing this will bring great joy.
[143:44.60]Boneless pizza.
[143:46.36]Boneless off the lip.
[143:51.28]Boneless into a grind into a fucking other grind into a fucking manual And then off that into a royal flush
[144:33.08]People that are just showing up for the first time that haven't been watching the stream are randomly going to see that trick and they're going to be blinking their eyes going, what?
[144:39.80]How is that in the game?
[144:40.72]I just did.
[144:41.23]Okay.
[144:43.03]Find the punks who stole the dex.
[145:17.11]It's not going to work.
[145:18.47]Where are the punks?
[145:19.11]Oh, I found a punk.
[145:25.18]Wink.
[145:39.79]Come here, you.
[145:40.17]You can just steal a deck and get away with it.
[145:54.43]Was there the punk?
[145:55.07]Punk?
[145:57.37]Where'd he go?
[146:00.22]Oh.
[146:00.30]Two punks.
[146:04.68]I just went through the hoop.
[146:14.81]Alright, looking for... I need three more punks.
[146:30.96]Where's this other guy?
[146:40.60]Over here?
[146:40.84]I saw his indicator.
[146:43.52]Oh, you're a... Oh, you... Okay.
[146:45.84]Just accidentally got one.
[146:47.89]He's accumulating wink debt.
[147:00.31]Going to Tampa.
[147:01.41]Check.
[147:01.73]We apparently didn't make it to Tampa, I guess.
[147:04.63]I'm assuming.
[147:29.06]One bad bumper sticker?
[147:33.26]Big mistake, you punks.
[147:34.88]It's not our car, man.
[147:37.02]We borrowed it.
[147:38.69]We like cops.
[147:40.75]Aren't you white meat supposed to be out fighting real crime?
[147:44.01]Like figuring out where that missing sprinkled donut went?
[147:47.97]Oh, that's real funny, smartass.
[147:50.41]Kiss your little roller skating contest goodbye.
[147:53.25]That is, unless your buddy here wants to do us some favors.
[148:00.91]The guy with the two backpacks on his knees.
[148:07.41]Alright, chapter seven, with syrup or jelly.
[148:12.05]Ooh, Tampa's cool.
[148:13.77]Wait, what's this?
[148:18.23]We just got a very rare T-pose, by the way.

[149:02.51]Don't mess it up, you goof.
[149:24.86]Okay, now get special and then... It's the car.
[149:29.69]And then, yeah, right through the cones.
[149:41.78]Where are the cones?
[149:49.30]Oh.
[149:52.35]Wait, will I just get special by doing this?
[149:54.27]Oh.
[149:58.94]Okay.
[149:59.10]Yeah, right.
[149:59.56]That's his next turn.
[150:15.60]Yeah!
[150:16.78]I just... I just... That's it.
[150:22.79]That's it.
[150:25.39]I think that... You might not be getting up from that one.
[150:30.45]Oh, that hurts.
[150:31.41]You're dead.
[150:32.48]That kills you.
[150:33.72]That actually... I think that actually kills you.
[150:37.59]Wall-less individual stickers everywhere.
[150:39.13]To wall ride, jump into the wall at an angle and hold grind.
[150:49.32]Then jump while wall riding to wall-y and access hard to reach high spots.
[150:56.33]Jump while we're on, okay.
[150:57.41]Wall ride, jump while wall riding.

[151:52.48]Is that a sticker?
[151:56.98]No?
[151:59.45]One more.
[152:05.46]What's that up there?
[152:06.02]Look at that!
[152:12.47]Come on, where's the final sticker?
[152:30.86]No Where's the last sticker?
[152:39.22]Shit
[152:57.09]I don't think I'm gonna find it.
[152:58.15]It's right over here.
[152:59.86]Rats!
[153:17.75]Who, anyone just come to the stream?
[153:19.89]Like anybody just like just kind of show up right now?
[153:26.45]Welcome to the stream, anyone that just like showed up for Tony Hawk?
[153:29.47]It's a pretty fun game.
[153:30.45]It's a pretty good game.
[153:34.70]Now let's see, what else can we do here?
[153:47.66]Remove all the stickers.
[153:48.54]Get the best donuts.
[153:50.16]We'll do this one.
[153:51.74]12 donuts.
[153:51.94]No, I can do that better.
[153:52.62]Just go like this.
[153:53.78]Grab here.
[153:54.10]Up there.
[153:54.28]Not enough momentum.

[154:22.02]Okay, there's another one right here.
[154:34.63]Cool.
[154:34.83]They're just a big line.
[154:40.63]Oh!
[154:41.91]That hurt.
[154:42.27]I was trying to go over it.
[154:50.77]Just grab it.
[154:56.89]Okay.
[155:06.38]You suck.
[155:11.92]Oh, look at this.
[155:17.24]Well, I didn't press the button fast enough.
[155:25.82]Oh, that would have been a straight line.
[155:33.72]I already got a mission for me.
[155:35.64]Oh, this deck is lucky.
[155:36.44]Let's get it.
[155:43.21]There's one up there.
[155:45.09]Stickers everywhere.
[155:49.55]One on the- behind the nude girl's place.
[155:51.85]One on the wall back here.
[155:53.77]One over here.
[155:55.43]And this one.
[155:57.77]Did I knock?
[155:58.59]Hmm.
[155:59.53]I'm gonna miss it.
[156:21.42]Someone's back here, right?
[156:24.30]Nooo.
[156:27.80]Where is that other one?
[156:31.58]Nooo.
[156:37.68]Someone's back here.
[156:39.46]Ah, I think this is the one I didn't get last time.
[156:41.22]Did I get this one last time?
[156:42.18]I don't think so.
[156:50.06]I think I did.
[156:57.29]There's the one right here.
[156:59.11]I didn't get it, but okay.
[157:01.86]There's one more.
[157:04.72]It has to be down here.
[157:09.76]I don't like that.
[157:42.58]Is that- those not stickers?
[157:53.21]I have no idea where it is.
[157:54.95]This way?
[157:55.99]Why am I missing this one every time?
[158:19.51]I pay less.
[158:19.99]He doesn't know.
[158:24.20]No, I don't.
[158:25.64]Every Tony Hawk game, I was always so awful with, like, the collect the thing.
[158:29.83]I just skipped every single one of them.
[158:34.99]Is there one down here?
[159:08.30]Oh fuck, it's right there!
[159:11.16]Okay.
[159:11.48]It's right there.
[159:13.40]I didn't get that one.
[159:14.68]Alright, no no no no no no no no no, let's go.
[159:16.40]Come on, I need to get to the last two.
[159:20.87]Alright, where's the strip club place?
[159:40.07]He didn't know.
[159:40.82]He doesn't know.
[159:41.54]He doesn't know.
[159:42.16]Don't tell him.
[159:42.70]Nobody tell him.
[159:45.22]Hey, anybody just showing up for the first time?
[159:51.72]What else we got?
[159:54.95]Skateboarding bandit and help the private eyes.
[159:57.51]Let's do skateboarding bandit.
[160:00.53]Okay.
[160:10.61]Oh, damn.
[160:11.67]Let's do it again.
[160:15.63]Ah, I did it again.
[160:25.04]Ooh!
[160:25.44]I did a cool move there.
[160:30.72]Nailed.
[160:31.88]Am I not going... Oh, I only have five seconds.
[160:34.59]Okay, right.
[160:44.98]Gotta go.
[160:52.77]Jesus.
[161:33.08]I get it?
[161:33.36]What?
[161:37.78]The one thing, okay, so if I jump off this, I go off to the left.
[161:40.70]I don't know why that happens.
[161:41.94]It's like the way my thumb is pressing on, you know what I'm saying?
[161:45.72]The way my thumb's pressing, it just always pushes me to the top left.
[161:52.43]That's not helping either.
[162:09.39]Damn it.
[162:09.75]See what I'm talking about?
[162:10.67]Like, I just, like, top left!
[162:12.49]Because just the way that my hand naturally presses up, it just goes up to the top left.
[162:27.16]How did I fail that?
[162:54.03]Thanks for being the cop's errand boy and getting me out of jail.
[162:56.93]Time for a little payback.
[162:58.53]Is he high right now?
[162:59.92]No, I just... It's hard to do that.
[163:02.26]Let's make sure he doesn't win.
[163:04.28]Grind down the Jed signs.
[163:11.17]Excuse me, Jed.
[163:21.84]No, I missed it.
[163:23.39]No.
[163:41.05]There's the other Jed sign.
[163:42.43]What's a Jed?
[163:46.61]Jed?
[163:46.93]Jed?
[163:47.21]That's screen tearing though.
[163:49.63]Jed.
[163:50.73]It's a Jed.
[163:54.42]Oh, is it- I gotta- Come on!
[163:55.74]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[164:30.50]One rock and roll all night!
[164:34.56]Wait, this is not the actual song.
[164:37.62]This is a live version.
[164:53.68]How is driving in a circle around the same block losing the cup?
[165:15.74]Not what happened this is not why would the third guy go over the third guy?
[165:24.87]You just watch two of us drive into the water and you're gonna do it to whatever Nice driving now, let's get out of here.

[165:59.63]A.k.a.
[166:00.29]cocky knucklehead.
[166:01.65]A.k.a.
[166:01.81]uh, now you're under arrest for fucking assaulting somebody you just don't know.
[166:04.91]You just slapped somebody you don't... You slapped him in the fucking face.
[166:07.43]Sign us both up, right?
[166:09.01]Well, I mean, I sent my informant, you know.
[166:11.89]Dude, look, I'll sign up now.
[166:13.41]I told you, the list is full.
[166:15.61]Feel free to watch from the bleachers, though.
[166:18.65]This is gonna be a double cross.
[166:20.03]Yeah.
[166:50.79]He's going to be mean to me and shit, and he's going to be like, you were always a loser, you were always nothing, and I'm going to have to beat him in the final.
[167:00.14]You skate pretty well, kid.
[167:02.08]There's a couple of things I want to see you do before you're ready for the Tampa Amp.
[167:06.16]First, land a trick with a spin.
[167:16.35]I'm going to be okay with this because I spin every time I do anything.
[167:25.25]Land a trick with at least a 540 and a revert.
[167:28.41]Now what?
[167:28.83]That's it.
[167:30.24]Cool.
[167:52.97]Any more pros?
[167:54.69]I like this place, Tampa's cool.
[168:01.82]Can't get in.
[168:09.14]So is there a reason why?
[168:10.20]I guess maybe there is a reason why, but I just don't like to admit it or something.
[168:18.79]Why has there never been another skating game like this?
[168:22.45]Did it just kind of fall out of popular culture and people just didn't really care anymore or something?
[168:35.94]Alright, let's get out of here.
[168:42.95]Pretty much.
[168:44.27]Didn't Tony Hawk make a new game this year or last year?
[168:47.21]It was like an iPad game or something.
[168:51.15]Was it any good?
[168:51.72]It was really bad.
[168:58.58]It was very bad.
[168:59.92]Let's see what we got here.
[169:02.88]Uh, party boat skate tricks.
[169:13.14]Welcome to Wet Beaver's Party Boat.
[169:15.24]This party's boring as hell.
[169:18.04]Let's liven it up with some skating.
[169:20.06]Nail the tricks I yell out.
[169:24.12]He'll flip.
[169:30.99]Of course the same person's getting hurt every time.
[169:35.35]You're leaning too far in, man.
[169:36.59]I'm hitting you in the face every time I go up.
[169:41.91]It's like giving me anxiety.
[169:44.20]I'm the same guy.
[169:48.83]Don't stand in the way.
[170:16.60]Oh boy!
[170:26.71]I'm telling you.
[170:28.14]It's me hitting the people is what's freaking me out.
[170:30.72]I feel like turning the volume off.
[171:01.96]Got it.
[171:05.59]He used a cheat code!
[171:09.95]Reminding me of my past meltdowns.
[171:12.85]Maybe.
[171:13.51]Beat Andrew's three best combos.
[171:25.14]What is that?
[171:36.81]That's pretty wild.
[171:37.69]What?
[171:40.37]I'm in the middle of a combo, Andrew.
[171:52.60]Uh, Andrew, I just destroyed your combo.
[172:04.26]Again, let's do it again, Andrew.
[172:09.14]Oh, well, uh... I gotta do it in a row.
[172:14.75]I just didn't realize where I was.
[172:36.55]okay next one okay now this is the one on the roof jump over it and land it's gonna go like this oh no I fell off alright
[173:08.21]Fancy.
[173:13.54]What?
[173:14.00]This is like a wall jump.
[173:38.56]Is this a molding scream in the making?
[173:39.84]No, this is the nature of Tony Hawk, man.
[173:46.68]Alright, let's get this one.
[173:51.60]Motherfucker.
[174:11.82]Streamer, look inside yourself.
[174:13.35]Wall plant combo.
[174:15.45]I bet you can't wall plant off the drawbridge.
[174:17.49]Here's where I learned how to do it.
[174:19.19]Jump straight into a wall and hit this.
[174:21.97]Jump straight into a wall and hit this.
[174:23.69]Come on.
[174:26.59]Hurry up.
[174:38.27]I'm losing balance here.
[174:45.99]There it is.
[174:48.04]Oh, I got points with that.
[174:51.50]Tony Hawk?
[174:53.22]I wonder what he's gonna say!
[174:56.90]Hey man, nice work over there on those grinds.
[174:59.37]You did such a good job.
[175:00.27]I'm gonna make sure I give the word and that you can do that next.
[175:02.77]You can do the competition in Tampa.
[175:08.67]540 flip?
[175:12.99]Schedule.
[175:25.89]Oh a 540.
[175:26.63]Whoops.
[176:04.55]I didn't even try to do it.
[176:06.79]I didn't even try.
[176:14.61]No, I need to do an Indy.
[176:16.43]Why am I doing an air walk?
[176:23.15]Hey, you skate pretty well.
[176:25.30]Let's see if you can hang with me.
[176:26.16]It's because of the Xbox buttons, the left and right.
[176:31.08]There he is.
[176:32.12]Let's see if you can hang with me.
[176:35.48]Beat Tony's score.
[176:51.42]I can't win this.
[176:52.29]That's the legendary Tony Hawk.
[177:15.66]Whoa, what do you call those moves, man?
[177:18.09]Oh, I'm just destroying him.
[177:21.97]Career over.
[177:24.51]Career over.
[177:28.51]Oh, this game is so fucking fun.
[177:40.28]I can't even play, man.
[177:44.84]Alright, I beat the shit out of him.
[177:47.29]He doesn't even stand a chance.
[177:59.32]Eric did better than Tony Hawk.
[178:06.07]Oh, not bad.
[178:07.82]Where are you from?
[178:09.08]I came all the way down from New Jersey for the Tampa Am.
[178:11.88]Talk about a surprise attack.
[178:13.28]If you stay on your board tomorrow, you'll walk away with the contest.
[178:16.02]I can't.
[178:16.66]It's full.
[178:17.16]Here we go.
[178:17.76]I worked so hard to get a sponsorship from Stacy Peralta.
[178:20.16]Stacy Peralta?
[178:21.56]I know that dude.
[178:22.84]He was my first sponsor, too, back in the 80s.
[178:25.48]Is he still into yoga?
[178:27.34]That's one weird dude.
[178:28.70]But cool as they come.
[178:30.18]Look, I can't make any guarantees, but I'll talk to the guys at the contest.
[178:34.08]Just show up tomorrow.
[178:35.83]This was way better than I thought it was going to be acting-wise.
[178:38.27]It was very good.
[178:39.55]That was actually just, that was very natural.
[178:41.57]Tony Hawk, like, actually naturally good actor.
[178:44.61]Well, that was pretty good.
[178:48.84]By the way, if Tony Hawk can't get you into a skating competition, then no one can.
[178:52.68]I don't think the president can, like, executive order get you in if Tony Hawk can't.
[179:04.06]That was good.
[179:08.33]Got a tight street comp going on.
[179:10.35]Best two out of three runs.
[179:12.23]Stay inside on the street course.
[179:13.37]Stay inside the course.
[179:13.95]Got a tight street comp going on.
[179:15.61]Best two out of three.
[179:16.95]Best two.

[181:53.18]I'm so glad.
[181:53.94]I'm so happy.
[181:55.64]That makes me so happy.
[181:57.94]Okay.
[181:59.70]Try and beat my high score.
[182:01.01]Stay on the rooftops.
[182:01.97]Okay.
[182:21.28]Oh, that's not a roof?
[182:22.74]How's that not a rooftop?
[182:38.21]Ooh, okay.
[182:45.52]Take it easy.
[182:47.04]Too easy to get too much momentum to fly off.
[182:51.85]I have two minutes.
[182:53.37]I know everyone's gonna call me a cheese ball for doing this, but that's fine.
[183:19.83]Fuck!
[183:20.13]Fuck!
[183:20.57]Fuck!
[183:20.81]Hold on.
[183:21.13]Oh, that's a broken arm.
[183:22.13]Alright, alright.
[183:23.21]I just need to kickflip in front like one or twice.
[183:49.81]You fucking cheese ball.
[183:51.65]You failed?
[183:52.74]Every 30 seconds the skater with the lowest score gets eliminated.
[184:21.04]Sorry, guys.
[184:21.60]You're dealing with a fucking pro.
[184:32.85]No!
[184:40.15]Dude, I have 31... Wait, I have 31,000 points.
[184:42.23]How am I out of the competition?
[184:44.29]What?
[184:49.05]What are you... I'm not... I'm in... What?
[184:53.08]How am I not in first place?
[185:02.54]Best trick competition.
[185:22.75]I'm so confused.
[185:23.57]Well, I have 48,000 points, but I'm not even on the list.
[185:28.88]Best trick, pop to advance.
[185:30.38]Alright, well, aren't we all just in here?
[185:39.40]Every 30 seconds it eliminates somebody.
[185:44.35]So why am I not on the list?
[185:55.92]Why do I have a small brain?
[185:59.80]You see your own score.
[186:01.00]Yeah, but I mean, wouldn't it be on the... It told me, like, oh, you're out of the competition area.
[186:19.46]I'm like, oh, I didn't know.
[186:23.85]So I have 44,000 points, so I'm in first place.
[186:32.27]Okay, so I can't really lose.
[186:46.74]Sloppily doubling everybody's points.
[187:14.65]30 seconds alright alright let's go I'm gonna do something good here make a good line
[187:33.82]Fuck!
[187:34.62]Sorry, that was a big one.
[187:46.85]Okay, I win.
[187:49.03]Yes, me and Eric.
[187:49.99]Biggest score.
[188:23.85]Choke, choke, choke.
[189:06.17]Reverting manual.
[189:07.03]I do manuals as much as I can.
[189:10.13]But like the revert into the manual.
[189:11.53]You like revert, manual.
[189:13.73]My brain kind of fucking freezes up.
[189:17.66]Good skating, man.
[189:18.68]That was insane.
[189:20.44]You gotta give me a call.
[189:21.56]I wanna hook you up with Birdhouse.
[189:22.91]Hey, ease off.
[189:23.93]You go ride for Flip, mate.
[189:24.95]Hey, come here.
[189:25.85]Would everybody just shut up for five seconds and let me talk to the damn kid?
[189:30.61]I gotta give it to you.
[189:31.53]That run was bullshit.
[189:33.75]No, in a good way, though.
[189:35.17]I'm gonna have to put you on element, bottom line.
[189:39.52]I'm on Element.
[189:41.46]All the major deck companies are after you.
[189:43.38]Time to check out some videos to see which sponsor best fits your style.
[189:47.86]The choice is yours.
[189:52.54]Birdhouse.
[189:55.97]Shaun White.
[189:57.23]Is that an Olympian?
[190:00.27]I thought it was a snowboarder.
[190:07.71]Holy shit, he skated?
[190:09.08]Wow.
[190:11.25]Vinny Vegas?
[190:22.15]Man, Margera.
[190:51.46]But I think it's safe to say that I'm staying in Philadelphia.
[190:57.66]Bam Margera.
[190:58.44]Here's the thing about Bam Margera.
[191:00.52]The reason why half of us think anything is funny is because of Bam Margera.
[191:15.05]Bam Margera.
[191:22.32]Bam invented comedy.
[191:23.72]That style of alternative comedy is jackass.
[191:26.30]Johnny Knoxville, those guys were nuts.
[191:29.14]Skating sucks.
[191:49.22]Booze sucks, drugs suck, life sucks.
[191:52.62]Everything sucks.
[191:55.42]That was pretty... That was horribly morbid.
[191:59.02]Holy shit!
[192:02.16]I don't think I want to join the life sucks gang.
[192:05.58]There's no skateboard there.
[192:26.55]Alright, I like this alright, okay, I kind of like that one cuz that was just like you that was pretty funny Kind of like yeah, right Pretty good
[193:01.77]This game is what made me want to be a graphics artist.
[193:08.00]I think like the thing about skateboarding, skateboarding in like the mid 90s into the early 2000s influenced so many random other cultures that have like counter cultures that moved in a million different places.
[193:23.51]It spread out everywhere.
[193:30.20]fashion graphic design videos making funny videos videos skateboarding groups would make skits and that's what I'm talking about talking about like bam margera and those guys are some of the reasons why we have to have the that we think is funny it's funny because they like did the skits it influenced so many things that you can't even wrap your brain around
[194:01.26]Alright, uh... For a second I thought this said John Birdhouse, John Element, John Flip, John Girl, John Zero.
[194:08.23]This is gonna be tough.
[194:10.47]Alright, uh... I liked the fun editing in Girl.
[194:17.10]We just had a bunch of subs come in, though.
[194:18.78]No, we didn't.
[194:19.16]It was a ton of money.
[194:21.74]King of Troll gets 10,000 bits.
[194:23.90]100 bucks.
[194:24.64]Put this forward something nice, Dram.
[194:26.02]I will.
[194:27.20]Thanks for the huge, ridiculous amount of money.
[194:34.57]I like the... As king of troll pets.
[194:37.95]Thank you.
[194:39.71]Uh, it's either gonna be girl or... Nah, it's gonna be girl.
[194:47.90]Welcome to girl!
[194:48.92]Gear up and then you'll be flown out to San Diego to meet the rest of your team.
[194:52.36]Alright, let's gear up.
[194:55.54]Let's see.
[195:09.55]I like my Almond Joy.
[195:10.34]Real color.
[195:18.50]I like Almond Joy.
[195:20.78]No, I can't.
[195:22.92]It's my board.
[195:23.46]I can't get rid of it.
[195:27.05]That's your sponsor.
[195:34.06]Hey, what's up?
[195:38.24]You get in from the airport, okay?
[195:39.75]Yeah, are you Todd?
[195:41.15]Hey, I want a sponsor, but I'm not gonna put any of your stuff on.
[195:43.29]Look, I gotta finish this meal before I go out to eat, so here's my skateboarding 101 spiel.
[195:47.69]The more coverage you get, the more crazy tricks you land, the more tours and free gear for you, okay?
[195:52.01]Just push yourself, show us your skittles, and everything is cool.
[195:55.67]Skittles?
[195:57.80]Look at those bitmap spaghetti french fries.
[195:59.76]They look so good.
[196:00.32]Alright.
[196:00.88]Prove yourself worthy.
[196:25.28]Oh, your HUD changes, too.
[196:27.50]That's cool.
[196:30.60]Rare T-pose starting.
[196:35.08]What do we got?
[196:37.52]Oh, what do we got to do for coverage these days?
[196:40.52]There's one that nobody will volunteer for.
[196:43.47]There's a bunch of flower boxes up on that sketchy ledge, and they want a picture of one of us grinding some of them down.
[196:49.25]Okay.
[196:51.67]You're up, newbie.
[196:52.83]You're up, newbie.
[196:55.37]Alright, so grind the boxes.
[196:56.43]Is that 10?
[197:02.36]Did I screw it up?
[197:05.00]Did I mess it up?
[197:12.61]Yes, I did.
[197:13.69]Oh boy.
[197:14.31]Okay.
[197:23.00]Did I get them all?
[197:24.82]Oh, that's freaky.
[197:25.92]This is tough.
[197:26.84]Alright.
[197:46.99]Oh, I missed one.
[198:02.22]Right here?
[198:04.88]Where was it?
[198:06.72]Nah, you gotta get it in one go.
[198:08.01]You gotta get it in one go.
[198:12.71]Oops.
[198:37.52]Okay.
[198:38.16]Floppy, but sloppy.
[198:41.50]What happened there?
[198:43.24]That was lame.
[198:44.97]No, it's lame maybe.
[198:47.71]Got the job done.
[198:48.69]Yes.
[198:49.29]What do you mean timing?
[199:06.31]That's the guy from American Dead.
[199:09.47]That's the... That's the... The guy... The boyfriend.
[199:14.03]Alright, let's do this.
[199:15.25]Let me see something basic for starters.
[199:17.15]Jeff.
[199:17.67]Yes.
[199:18.05]That's Jeff from American Dead.
[199:32.86]Double kickflip over the stairs.
[200:01.18]Let's be faster than that.
[200:05.63]There we go.
[200:09.89]Jeff, I did a triple kickflip.
[200:11.42]You can use it.
[200:33.83]Why can I not hit this?
[200:35.69]Bang bang!
[200:37.23]Bang bang!
[200:41.03]Jeff!
[200:42.64]You got film in that fucking camera?
[201:12.48]Double impossible over the stairs That was pretty cool.
[201:18.19]What's that called?
[201:18.69]Impossible?
[201:46.00]Come on.
[201:51.68]Stop doing that.
[201:52.74]Stop doing the worst move.
[201:55.23]I don't even have special.
[202:02.57]Please wake up.
[202:03.47]You're unconscious.
[202:06.41]Jerma, please.
[202:07.01]You're unconscious.

[202:12.31]Cool.
[202:12.51]Okay.
[202:12.77]Melon, over the gap.

[202:57.68]That wasn't it?
[203:06.00]Oh, I get it.
[203:06.64]I just bell- That was a melon.
[203:19.81]That was a melon.
[203:35.90]Get Otto out of the room.
[203:36.84]Hold on.
[203:37.74]After I land this threat.
[203:43.11]That was a melon!
[203:45.70]How was that?
[204:03.91]that's not the gap of the I don't think I said it's the gap how was that any different I don't understand now let's get something a little tougher of the gap
[204:37.15]Actually, let's take break number one.
[204:39.44]Let's take a full break.
[204:40.18]I'm going to get some water.
[204:41.68]It's been three and a half hours.
[204:43.27]First break of the night.
[209:07.52]I am back.
[209:08.12]Got myself a sprite on the rocks.
[209:24.10]Show Otto?
[209:24.70]He's not even in the room anymore.
[209:29.54]How's Otto after the surgery?
[209:33.50]He is fully healed.
[209:36.27]Stitches have been removed.
[209:38.62]He is back to 100% normal.
[209:42.86]He's good to go.
[209:44.92]He is healed up very nicely.
[209:46.30]Alright, something a little tougher over the gap.
[209:55.15]Stiffy.
[210:00.04]I need some air.
[210:03.45]Get some air from here.
[210:05.61]There we go, that should be it.
[210:09.77]Oh!
[210:09.87]Just watch.
[210:10.61]Fine.
[210:11.29]I've used this twice.
[210:21.88]There we go.
[210:26.62]Shit.
[210:38.82]I'm so bad at this oh that was it
[211:08.51]wow kid you've got serious skills how about another tough one over go for it this is uh rocket air over there
[211:30.65]I was not even in range of the photo.
[211:32.95]Crazy.
[211:33.75]You're unstoppable.
[211:35.17]They just want one more shot.
[211:36.76]Let me see something really big over it and we're done here.
[211:39.54]One foot tail grab.
[211:41.56]There we go.
[211:52.98]Nail this run.
[211:57.96]Alright.
[211:58.90]That's a really long spear or lance.
[212:04.29]How do you hold that?
[212:07.71]I feel like that thing would turn... You know when you have a tape measure out too far and the thing just goes to shit when it's out like that?
[212:13.48]I feel like that's impossible to hold and throw.
[212:20.17]You just worry about busting them over the spine transfer on the statue.
[212:24.35]Rock and roll, kid.
[212:26.65]Bursting?
[212:27.41]Busting them over the spine transfer.
[212:29.45]I have to go.
[212:29.91]I see.
[212:30.23]You get this L and R on the statue.
[212:32.25]Cool.
[212:32.41]Bring it back.
[212:49.24]I get it, I get it.
[212:50.68]Tail grab over statue.
[212:51.94]It was sloppy, but I did it.
[212:54.20]You want a bunch of kickflips?
[212:56.47]Sure, I can do that.
[212:57.61]No, I can't.
[213:20.42]L, R, up, and X. Well, that's a lot of buttons.
[213:25.94]It's like scratch your head, rub your face.
[213:30.63]Hold down X, L, R, and then when you let go of A, up, R, it's like a lot of my brain's processing.
[213:44.62]Good.
[213:45.06]Try to do one at a time.
[213:46.42]Indeed.
[213:46.72]Mellon.
[214:16.39]I technically got it.
[214:18.83]Dermot, make a joke or I'm going to drop out of high school.
[214:25.87]Sorry, you're not going to be getting your diploma.
[214:34.92]I don't like this one.
[214:52.87]I gotta do two tricks in a row.
[214:54.25]What do we got?
[214:55.71]Indy?
[214:59.57]Slow down, slow down, slow down.
[215:00.65]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[215:03.31]Okay, think about a bunch of Impossibles in a row.
[215:19.90]What the fuck was that?
[215:24.16]What?
[215:24.80]I didn't even want to do that, man!
[215:26.48]Look at all these tricks.
[215:42.20]This might be it.
[215:42.82]I'm not gonna get it.
[215:54.43]Let's try it again.
[215:56.63]No more grab moves.
[215:59.39]Q. Make a joke?
[216:01.99]No.
[216:02.22]How many of you guys are going to drop out of high school if I don't make a joke in 10 minutes?
[216:06.58]Stay in school for fuck's sake.
[216:25.74]But I graduated.
[216:27.20]Well, that's good.
[216:29.80]Don't drop out of school.
[216:32.92]Because I didn't make a job right.
[216:35.73]That person is just fucking with me.
[216:36.85]This wasn't an indie.
[216:58.12]No, do it again.
[217:15.02]Bleh.
[217:28.22]Does that count?
[217:29.14]Not really.
[217:32.90]No grabs.
[217:37.91]No, just turn around and do it.
[217:42.33]Okay, nose grab, heel flip.
[217:46.69]That wasn't a nose grab?
[217:50.55]Why?
[217:50.97]I just did up and D.
[217:58.95]That's it.
[218:00.11]That was hard.
[218:02.06]Real wink?
[218:07.32]Every day we get darker and darker.
[218:09.08]Here we go!
[218:22.28]What was the, um, the mission that the person said, if I do it within four tries, they'll give me, like, $100?
[218:32.87]It's, like, an impossible mission that they would, like, this mission sucks, you're gonna hate it, but if you do it within four tries, they'll give you $100?
[218:39.41]Which one was it?
[218:49.86]It was like the spot, like the cool, like the spot one, the cool spot or something.
[218:53.80]Big apple spot challenge.
[218:56.56]Yeah, okay.
[218:57.56]The big apple spot challenge.
[219:01.16]If I beat that within four tries, they'll give me $100.
[219:05.69]Nobody said that.
[219:06.39]Why would I even know what that is?
[219:08.25]The cool, the apple, big apple spot?
[219:12.71]Man, we need to get some flyers thrown around for this party.
[219:18.62]I said I would throw up a cheesesteak on my keyboard, not give you $100.
[219:22.95]I said nothing about $100, you fucking greedy streamer.
[219:37.84]Well, hold on a minute.
[219:39.84]Are you eating a cheesesteak right now?
[219:43.38]Because that would make you a liar if I did it within four tries.
[219:51.38]Are you eating a cheesesteak today?
[220:00.04]Slap these flies around by doing wall plants.
[220:02.94]Okay, cool.
[220:04.62]What the fuck?
[220:08.82]I'm literally eating a cheesesteak.
[220:10.24]But you don't have to throw it up onto your keyboard if I do it in four tries.
[220:14.59]Hold on a minute.
[220:47.30]Oh, he has a green shirt on.
[220:48.60]Fuck, never mind.
[221:01.09]I don't... Oh, he got a pred... Ahhhh!
[221:07.82]Keep moving.
[221:15.86]Don't just restart.
[221:16.58]It's fine.
[221:16.88]You don't have to restart every time.
[221:21.82]What is he?
[221:22.26]Pretending?
[221:24.58]Stop pretending.
[221:27.48]There's no way this is not... There's no way this guy's not pretending right now.
[221:40.63]Get...
[221:47.73]Alright, there's two more.
[221:49.61]One here.
[221:53.11]I'm not dumb.
[222:04.57]You're dumb.
[222:05.15]I'm not dumb.
[222:06.51]You're dumb.
[222:17.94]What do you got?
[222:18.40]He's killing his streaming career.
[222:20.73]Alright, get the instruments.
[222:22.73]They're probably gonna be on a line here.
[222:24.67]If I was gonna guess, I'd be like, yeah, there's one.
[222:28.87]Upset?
[222:29.21]Problems?
[222:58.22]I see a microphone.
[223:01.39]I see... Let's go this way.
[223:08.63]There's another one.
[223:16.26]There's a place where everyone can be happy.
[223:18.50]It's the most beautiful place in the whole wide fucking world.
[223:21.80]That's the best song of any Tony Hawk game.
[223:42.38]This is the last one.
[223:49.83]Up and up.
[223:51.31]Oh!
[223:52.91]That's gonna be actually tricky to get to.
[223:55.28]Climb it.
[224:14.11]Really?
[224:15.65]The one place that hurts is your knee.
[224:21.33]Those must be inflatable then.
[224:25.27]Get up in the chat.
[224:29.93]What's up, dude?
[224:33.83]So the party's cool and all, but there aren't enough girls here.
[224:36.47]It's a total dude festival.
[224:39.94]Tony Hawks in the chat?
[224:41.16]Tony.
[224:41.38]Let me do some consulting work for you.
[224:43.38]I love these games.
[224:46.59]And as you can see, I get 20 to 30,000 points when I get in a line.
[224:49.07]So I know the game.
[225:04.94]A party, huh?
[225:06.42]Well, maybe if you show me how handy you are with that skateboard, I'll come to your party.
[225:10.84]How about showing me a combo?
[225:13.06]You wanna see a combo?
[225:14.79]Show me a combo.
[225:19.19]How's that?
[225:22.99]Shit.
[225:24.13]Did you get hit by a car?
[225:37.74]Stay right there, I'll do it.
[225:40.70]My face is itchy, hold on.
[225:45.65]Okay.
[225:53.21]Coming to the party!
[226:06.46]Wait.
[226:08.44]Pick up girls for the party.
[226:09.80]I can only have one person in this car.
[226:11.37]What do you mean freestyle trick?
[226:12.29]Start manualing and show me some tricks.
[226:31.23]You are you're asking a lot in a row I
[227:08.68]Okay, who cares?
[227:09.18]I'm just gonna go this way.
[227:38.68]B and X, that's a weird combo to do.
[227:42.30]Your hands can't do that.
[227:43.56]I have to B in front of you?
[227:44.96]How can you just walk with me?
[228:09.63]I'm doing it, look!
[228:27.16]god damn it this is tricky
[228:52.03]Yo, Emanuel, you motherfucker!

[230:09.17]Alright, do I have to be in front of you?
[230:11.39]Let me see.

[231:34.55]Jerma looks like the mom from Dexter's lab.
[232:08.85]Yeah.
[232:12.17]Yeah, kinda.
[232:16.24]Kinda.
[232:17.60]Whatever.
[232:27.34]If I flip this thing, I don't hurt anybody.
[232:31.59]Alright, we got a full house!
[232:39.86]Hey, I snuck out of the party and hooked up some real fun.
[232:42.74]What does that mean?
[232:44.44]I snaked one of those carts from behind the amphitheater.
[232:46.51]Okay.
[232:47.85]And some of the other guys set up a little racetrack for us.
[232:52.29]See if you can beat my best lap.
[232:53.35]In a car?
[232:54.11]It's going to take some skittles, as that dork Todd likes to put it.
[232:58.60]Just call him a dork.
[233:00.58]Beat Jordan's best lap.
[233:07.44]This arrow is not helping me.
[233:31.23]It counts, hit it.
[234:00.33]You wanna save?
[234:01.25]Yes.
[234:01.55]Is this a Spongebob driving test?
[234:03.30]What's wrong with me?
[234:03.98]Man, what demo?
[234:22.37]The team demo.
[234:24.37]Come on, I want you to get the new guy.
[234:26.57]Yeah, I do.
[234:27.07]I look like a Dexter.
[234:28.70]Dexter character.
[234:30.32]You're on the team?
[234:31.78]He's like Dexter's older cousin.
[234:34.20]That's cool.
[234:34.84]I can see how busy you've been.
[234:37.10]Ah, you guys know each other?
[234:41.01]Anyway, why don't you find the rest of the team?
[234:43.09]They scattered after the party.
[234:44.57]I'll see you guys at the demo after I chow down.
[234:50.34]Alright.
[234:51.66]So yeah, new friend became enemy.

[235:00.13]Mhm.
[235:17.03]Alright, get the team members.

[235:26.81]Do they have a green indicator?
[235:40.00]Good one.
[235:44.37]Yeah, they do have an indicator.
[235:50.12]Hey, get over here.
[235:50.64]You're gonna miss the demo, man!
[235:52.66]Come on, it's gonna be some kind of record.
[236:30.45]I'm just, like, skating around.
[236:31.81]Yeah, I'm just having fun.
[236:33.55]I shouldn't be doing that.
[236:34.59]I need to go find these guys.
[236:35.81]Alright, there's two.

[242:08.23]Alright, I remember this one.
[242:14.17]Sorry, itchy.
[242:18.56]What?
[242:19.14]Apparently I got him.

[242:59.29]Alright, let's go.
[243:14.19]No.
[243:14.29]Alright, let's get him.
[243:23.74]I did find him, though.

[243:25.32]I did find him.
[243:28.03]Two... Three is... that way.
[243:37.02]Gotta get up here and grind it.
[243:39.58]It's not what I wanted to do.
[243:41.70]What are you?
[243:42.42]A dumb person?
[243:59.00]Okay, two more.
[244:03.17]There was somebody in this building over here.
[244:05.39]Stop.
[244:10.65]And then... Where is the other one?
[244:13.85]I got three minutes of us to find him.
[244:15.35]Alright, any doctors in chat?
[244:18.84]Are there any doctors in here?
[244:25.67]Alright, what does it mean when my entire face is itchy?
[244:29.62]And it never stops.
[244:31.26]And I don't have any allergies.
[244:32.50]What does that mean?
[244:40.83]Because every like three to four minutes, I have an itchy spot somewhere on my face.
[244:45.94]What does that mean?
[244:50.64]My man's dry.
[244:51.18]No, no, no.
[244:52.16]No, I'm not.
[244:52.88]I'm moisturized completely.
[244:53.62]Dry skids.
[244:53.94]What do I have to do?
[244:54.96]Just hitch for 60 seconds?
[244:56.44]Oh.
[245:20.49]That didn't seem fair.
[245:43.57]Oh, right.
[245:44.11]It's like Temple Run.
[246:03.05]That hurt.
[246:05.31]Mobile gaming streamer.
[246:06.93]And then I played Temple Run maybe once.
[246:09.99]That's what this mechanic is.
[246:15.56]This is not even me doing this.
[246:17.92]This guy's just running over everybody he's at work with.
[246:20.70]No, don't.
[246:21.40]I'm so close.
[246:22.28]Just get over here.
[246:22.94]Come here.
[246:36.72]No!
[246:38.62]Stop!
[246:39.04]Wait!
[246:39.80]Wait for me!
[246:48.61]What was that move?
[246:49.67]What was that guy doing?
[246:51.63]Come on, I'm so close!
[247:04.82]It's hard to tell where they're going
[247:38.67]That was stupid.
[247:39.88]I'm going so fast right now.
[247:49.22]Gotta pay attention to the bar and the rings cause these guys are gonna be standing.
[248:07.82]Dude, I'll give you fucking 60 bucks if you can beat this first try.
[248:13.98]Right, Derva?
[248:17.53]Will you really?
[248:18.09]Nope.
[248:18.79]I'm actually just gonna throw up a ham sandwich on my keyboard or something.
[248:36.58]Alright, get it.
[248:38.02]Don't let go.
[248:38.66]Oh, shit!
[248:39.08]Okay.
[249:07.33]He's coming down here, right?
[249:14.66]Okay, a few goals.
[249:23.01]Only probably one or two left, right?
[249:24.91]Three is a crowd.
[249:26.17]Find more kids.
[249:28.55]I love the... I love the Sonic the Hedgehog actor.
[249:31.29]That people do.
[249:56.06]Hold on, let me itch my fucking, like, rotten face.
[250:01.74]Here we go.
[250:12.76]Ready?

[250:28.66]It's time for you to pay!
[250:29.66]Sure.
[250:29.80]Grind the bar.
[250:30.44]Nosebleed.
[250:30.92]A double nosebleed.
[251:01.85]Alright, let's do it.
[251:02.81]Can I switch it up?
[251:08.00]Ooh.
[251:08.12]50-50.
[251:11.08]Nice.
[251:13.84]Three 50-50s and then a nose blunt.
[251:24.00]He's instantly just retrying every single failure.
[251:26.84]Yeah, that's what you do.
[251:31.27]You gotta, you gotta, because it's not clean in your brain and you don't want to do it.
[251:37.70]Like, for instance, I would have just restarted right there, but I might still be able to do it.
[252:06.35]go faster restart Randy restart Randy faster faster I'm going as fast as I can how is that not an Xbox 360 controller
[252:37.95]I got it.
[253:31.40]Nose grind.
[253:32.12]Good.
[253:32.44]Good RNG.
[253:32.85]Pop pop.
[253:33.83]Good RNG.
[253:34.71]Look at that RNG.
[253:35.55]It's like playing Tetris.
[254:08.81]I'll try.
[254:09.09]Alright, reporter.
[254:10.93]Take a look at this one.
[254:11.70]Get a huge score to impress the media.
[254:50.48]You bought that in one combo?
[254:51.64]Is that what you wanted?
[254:52.44]My buddies refused to believe me when I told them how good you are.
[254:55.30]They want to see you hold some crazy lip trick up on the stage lights.
[255:04.39]Get special and press just before the lip.
[255:08.33]Okay.
[255:34.03]Alright, what do you want me to do?
[255:38.81]Press right just before lifting on the stage lights.
[255:41.93]Is that it?
[255:48.98]I don't think that's right.
[256:01.16]I did it right?
[256:01.74]Does that count?
[256:47.75]Going Hawaii Can you believe it Hawaii you must be stoked the team usually doesn't bring hams on a trip this big And those sketches are awesome.
[257:08.05]Did you draw them?
[257:09.37]Nah, some artist did they're the graphics for my new pro model.
[257:12.65]I
[257:14.48]I'm gonna ask the... I'm gonna ask what's wrong with the character.
[257:32.33]um it's a weird glitch that happens in the game sometimes this is original Xbox by the way um if you get more than two million points in one combo the game can kind of up and when it loads the actual combo alright you can mess up your character and we paid for your trip to Hawaii getting sick footage is your job obviously I did it I did that spots now we're gonna premiere our video in Vancouver at the slam city jam so don't half-ass it we hook up in three days

[297:53.82]Where?
[298:19.90]Oh, Jesus.
[298:23.72]Freakout gave like $150 over the course of like three, five different things.
[298:48.10]What is this?
[298:49.44]Jerma watching for a couple years want to hear a fun fact about nuts.
[298:53.34]In World War II, during the siege of Bastogne, the Jerma forces sent a letter to McAuliffe, who was commanding the 100th Airborne trapped in the town.
[299:03.48]In the letter, the Germans were offering the US troops an honorable surrender.
[299:09.70]otherwise they would launch an artillery strike.
[299:11.50]General McAuliffe was not a fan of cursing, so after he read it, he said, However, the Yanks still had to reply to the Germans, otherwise they'd be wiped out by the shelling.
[299:24.18]While trying to find proper response to the letter, Lieutenant Colonel Kynard said that McAuliffe basically summed up the situation, so when the Americans finished their letter and sent it to the Jerma commander, Nutz, the American commander,
[299:41.45]That's nuts, right?
[299:43.51]I love you and all you do for this community but I wanted to ask is voice acting something you still want to pursue with your little career?
[299:48.05]My little career?
[300:03.43]I don't think they meant that in a negative way, by the way.
[300:07.34]I've only been in three or four different productions.
[300:09.94]I think that's what they mean.
[300:12.44]Not like, hey, dude, your career sucks.
[300:16.94]It was pretty short.
[300:17.78]Yeah, I don't think that's what they mean by that.
[300:21.10]No, this is my focus.
[300:24.63]And, I mean, just take a look at the last four days straight, five days straight.
[300:29.56]Like, this is what I do.
[300:30.54]This is my 100% focus.
[300:33.92]This stream, this community, is the priority.
[300:38.88]So... It's like I can't... I don't... I can't, like, take time to do auditions and do lines.
[300:48.38]And, oh, this script has a viewer character that has 250 lines of dialogue.
[300:51.06]I...
[300:53.72]It's just a ton of time with a director, and it's just not something I want to focus on.
[301:03.55]So... Voice acting is cool, it's fun, and it's really, really interesting stuff.
[301:09.93]But this is the focus.
[301:15.62]Thanks for your interesting nut message.
[301:19.47]I do appreciate the fact that this time you did not, uh, you did not spam a bunch of codes.
[301:24.45]So, thank you for that.
[301:25.69]And thanks for the huge amount of fucking money.
[301:32.69]He hates voice acting.
[301:35.48]I wanna get onto the roof of the Big Surf Hotel.
[301:37.98]Start that.
[302:03.64]Okay.
[302:04.88]Now... Now where?
[302:08.49]Over... Uh, can I go up?
[302:13.21]Wait, oh god, I gotta get up here.

[315:00.74]Come on.
[315:06.45]That was cute.
[315:21.35]That was fun.
[315:25.12]PS2 had some of the best games.
[315:32.94]I will agree with you there.
[315:42.77]I'm going to get air.

[330:08.78]And I dropped all of it on the floor.
[330:11.80]Potentially a new floor.

[332:55.11]Yeah, why is the color on?
[332:56.05]Should we go down here?
[333:06.69]That's weird.
[333:07.43]Get everybody to the premiere!

[333:53.74]Alright, let's see.
[333:54.38]Let's take a look at my skiing footage.
[334:07.95]This game is so shit laughing my ass off.
[334:10.01]What a funny pretend comment that is.
[334:13.85]Fucking Eric edited his face on my footage.
[334:16.57]Time to introduce our newest pro, Eric Sparrow!
[334:37.23]Eric's on his way to the Moscow Invitational, and his first pro board will be coming out in two months!
[334:44.04]Hey, Eric, do that trick that you did off the roof again.
[334:45.96]That's what I would do.
[334:47.52]You poached my shots.
[334:49.22]Where's my footage?
[334:51.23]Oh, man, I'm covering myself to tell you, see, there was this thing at customs.

[335:44.38]Alright, let's do it.
[335:51.17]This is a cool park.
[336:01.33]Guys, I think the skate park would make it a big return.
[336:05.40]Skating is so hard.
[336:07.26]Doing this kind of shit, I mean obviously this is like an arcade game.
[336:11.52]But holy shit.
[336:13.48]It takes so much skill to be able to do any of this shit.
[336:22.18]Oh my god, that would have been fucking a lot.
[336:25.62]This isn't real.
[336:26.32]Yeah, but have you ever seen an actual skate video before?
[336:28.40]That shit is insane.
[336:33.26]Imagine jumping over the boards and sliding down a bar and not, like, fucking instantly dying.
[336:42.43]Like, oh, I'm just gonna jump down 30 flights of stairs on a bar.
[336:45.49]Like, holy shit, that's so scary.
[336:50.96]Takes so much skill and so much patience.
[336:56.34]I'm on the list.
[336:57.94]Destroy this free competition.
[337:00.88]Do my best.
[337:18.76]Should we show them up our special move?
[337:20.62]Okay, I gotta incorporate my special move.
[337:58.34]That felt nice.
[337:59.50]Damn it.
[338:10.97]I love this game.
[338:11.87]No!
[338:14.19]Xbox!
[338:17.19]Xbox, why?
[338:18.41]Xbox, that was like 180,000 points.
[338:21.55]Xbox, what have you done to me?
[338:28.72]Xbox, what have you done?
[338:34.19]Okay, well, I mean, I got... I'm in first place.
[338:36.63]Eric Sparrow sucks.
[338:37.57]Let's go.
[338:37.97]Wow.
[339:00.13]Don't do it yet.
[339:01.05]Don't end it yet.
[339:02.51]Now do it.
[339:26.62]I just went through it.
[339:27.84]Alright, 200,000 should be good.
[339:34.27]Okay, get in a run.
[339:41.73]Okay..
[340:00.27]Big finish, here we go.
[340:01.67]God damn it!
[340:02.33]Come on, big finish!
[340:04.97]I lost it at the end, man.
[340:08.57]I'm still- I can literally do whatever I want.
[340:11.09]I almost have a perfect score.
[340:44.80]I like this space.
[340:45.84]It's great.
[340:46.66]Wait a minute.
[340:47.84]Are you kidding me?
[340:48.92]What the hell was that?
[340:50.68]You seeing this shit?
[340:52.98]Mom, get the camera!
[341:40.11]Let's do some halfpipe shit.
[341:58.97]It's okay.
[342:02.99]Oh, that was so much fun.
[342:04.67]Just flying around and going like...
[342:11.20]I love it.
[342:11.54]That was 132,000.
[342:40.51]This game is so good.
[342:41.23]It's always Thug 2.
[342:42.01]Yeah, it was.
[342:42.43]He's not very good.
[343:16.46]Good job.
[343:17.12]Now let's go again.
[343:18.00]Hit the same hip transfer first.
[343:21.26]Then continue on to the second hip transfer.
[343:29.17]That was fucking awesome.
[343:30.51]Way better than what you wanted me to do.
[344:01.49]Alright, let's do some more stuff.
[344:04.58]How does it never get old?
[344:07.84]I don't know.
[344:08.20]It just doesn't.
[344:08.88]It's weird.
[344:12.56]Any more, uh, quests?
[344:16.54]I want to put some new tricks on, too.
[344:18.20]These are getting a little stale for me.
[344:22.75]Edit tricks.
[344:24.37]Rab tricks.
[344:25.07]I want to do, uh...
[344:27.73]Get rid of the Melon, and let's put on fucking Cannonball.
[344:30.97]Get rid of the Indy, and let's do the Madonna.
[344:33.05]Get rid of the Japan, let's put on... Stale Fish.
[344:40.08]Instead of Indy Stiffy, let's do... Crossbone.
[344:44.30]Let's check it out.
[345:02.48]I gotta learn how to... Let's see, where's the actual part?
[345:05.22]Okay, I'm going to turn it here.
[345:09.06]Kind of hard to land.
[345:11.62]Yeah, that's hard to land.
[345:21.09]Ooh!
[345:21.67]Whoa!
[345:22.47]Hold on.
[345:24.27]Christ, air.
[345:27.87]They're all kind of hard to land.
[345:36.44]No, that's alright.
[345:42.93]You're killing this guy.
[345:44.61]He'll be fine.
[345:52.55]Christ, they're fine.
[346:08.19]We're making our own Crystair.
[346:09.35]Alright, holdable, yes.
[346:41.39]Just make him a drill.
[346:42.84]No, we can't spin.
[346:44.22]Just turn him into a helicopter.
[346:52.70]It's gonna be another spin joke.
[346:54.62]That's gonna be fucking great.
[347:19.91]Alright, that's good.
[347:55.80]Somebody said just do cry stare, but just add a fart to it.
[348:00.94]Imagine if I actually did something like that.
[348:04.30]That's it.
[348:04.66]That's the only change.
[348:08.46]Look at how bad.
[348:10.16]What is it?
[348:11.96]There's a toy.
[348:12.72]There's a toy that you pull a little string and it like spins and it's like a flower that opens up.
[348:20.72]You know what I'm talking about?
[348:27.17]It's like a little, it's like a cheap little toy that just like, you can like open it up, open it up, open it up.
[348:32.93]What are those things called?
[348:34.23]They're like a dollar.
[348:47.22]Oh, how many can I add?
[348:53.22]That hurts my head, actually.
[349:03.57]It's one of those, it's a helicopter.
[349:56.68]It's too much.
[349:57.46]It needs to be shorter.
[349:58.54]It needs to be shorter by a little bit.
[350:03.28]Imagine holding this.
[350:20.72]I want a quick one.
[350:23.56]No, hold on.
[350:29.99]It's holdable.
[350:34.85]Make it .1 second.
[350:52.04]Now imagine thinking that was any different.
[350:53.88]It's the same thing.
[350:56.14]Just... Okay.
[351:08.75]Back to editor.
[351:50.77]You know what?
[351:52.83]No.
[351:54.79]No.
[352:00.86]No.
[352:02.96]No.
[352:06.90]I've got a better idea.
[352:16.93]I want to be able to do a kickflip, but just do a backflip.
[352:21.14]You know what I mean?
[352:21.56]Just like, wham!
[352:22.58]Imagine doing a backflip and landing on a grind.
[352:45.11]See what I mean?
[352:49.83]That's fucking so stupid.
[353:06.96]And here we go, one, two... Add the fart.
[353:16.83]No.
[353:24.92]I feel like I modded this.
[353:26.52]I mean like this just feels like it shouldn't ever be in the game.
[353:37.81]It's a literal backflip 7 because it's technically a kickflip.
[353:50.96]Imagine not getting an actual 10 out of 10 for doing this.
[354:01.89]Jesus!
[354:21.15]Alright, we're good.
[354:29.74]This one's called 1... 1B.
[354:31.84]1 back.
[354:32.42]No.
[354:33.36]1... Back.
[354:36.02]Back 1.
[354:48.19]Back 1.
[354:48.53]That's what it is.
[354:53.92]That's boring.
[354:54.86]It means invent a funny name.
[354:57.16]Um, it's a backflip.
[354:59.20]That's it.
[355:00.08]Where... What do you want me to call it?
[355:03.30]Oh, the Scoopity Poopity?
[355:05.00]It's a backflip.
[355:06.28]That's it.
[355:06.60]It's just a backflip.
[355:18.21]Backspace.
[355:19.99]I like Backspace.
[355:39.24]Capitalize the flip.
[355:44.89]Okay, let's get out of here.
[355:48.13]Edit tricks.
[355:48.73]Flip tricks.
[355:51.46]Here we go.
[355:52.38]I'm going to put it on to this hard flip here.
[356:22.00]you unsubbed because no poopity poopity I'm so sorry alright blimp crazy ass fans competition won't start until they're removed from the lights fans are on the lights I have to use a blimp
[356:50.39]Uh, I'm just like, killing it.
[356:54.54]Blimp controls.
[356:56.08]Celebrate?
[356:56.40]How do I go up?
[356:59.00]I don't think I can move it.
[357:04.32]I think I can just go left and right.
[357:31.55]I got him.
[357:42.78]Go up!
[357:42.92]I just hit an invisible wall.
[357:45.12]What was that, game?
[357:46.50]Come on, you're supposed to be in 97!
[357:48.94]Stop!
[358:00.08]I should have known it would be down to you and me.
[358:02.32]You were always fighting my style.
[358:04.22]You can't beat my scores, and you can't hit my lines.
[358:09.52]Oh, yeah?
[358:11.58]Here's a free lesson.
[358:12.87]Wow.
[358:18.73]Ooh.
[358:25.65]Ooh, look at that.
[358:29.08]So good.
[358:30.40]So good.
[358:33.34]Just standard jumps and standard kickflips.
[358:39.34]Safe.
[358:41.22]Nice, but safe.
[358:47.01]Okay.
[358:48.79]When are you going to be done?
[358:53.17]He's actually pretty impressive.
[358:54.31]He's still going.
[358:57.51]He still got this combo going.
[358:59.99]I'm actually a little concerned now.
[359:01.41]I don't think I'm going to be able to do this.
[359:04.21]This is like five laps on the course.
[359:08.53]Course A?
[359:08.91]Oh, shit.
[359:09.45]Wait, why not...
[359:39.61]Okay, it's actually a little distracting.
[359:43.83]I don't know if I like this.
[360:06.80]I would take it off.
[360:16.51]I don't like it.
[360:22.71]It's super distracting and it's very... It's kind of ruining my runs.
[360:27.91]I can't take it off.
[360:41.59]That's too much credit I didn't catch it
[361:13.97]Get it off.
[361:14.47]Get it off.
[361:14.97]Get it off.
[361:15.49]Get it off.
[361:16.17]Get it off.
[361:16.66]I can't stand it.
[361:18.30]It's too fucked up.
[361:19.84]Get it off.
[361:24.30]Put anything else.
[361:25.16]I don't care what it is.
[361:26.60]Get it off.
[361:27.32]I don't want to see it anymore.
[361:29.50]It's not gonna happen.
[361:32.79]We'll just do a varial heel flip there.
[361:34.85]That sounds like a good one.
[361:37.28]You know what I mean?
[361:39.62]Like, it's not... My whole body isn't moving around.
[361:42.71]Fuck you, I had that.
[361:43.29]Fuck.
[362:09.80]Fuck off, Eric.
[362:23.57]How's that fucking taste, Eric?
[362:41.66]I'm a pro now.
[362:42.38]Did he say bovine balls?
[363:19.93]Create a deck.
[363:20.51]Now that you're a pro, you'll need to design your own pro deck graphic.
[363:26.30]Oh, nice.
[363:27.51]Base graphic.
[363:50.05]I don't know.
[364:24.72]Breaks.
[364:40.56]Rock.
[365:36.09]Really?
[365:41.41]What?
[365:53.50]Oh no, I can only have one of these?
[366:07.31]move it here we go okay looks good okay another one wait I can only I can't only have one
[366:38.82]I could tease 4 slot emotes
[367:19.61]I can only have it once.
[367:20.59]Oh well.
[367:21.19]Alright, I'm gonna do... I don't like any of these.
[367:24.43]Maybe the fire?
[367:53.61]Hmm, I don't really want anything.
[367:55.97]No, I don't want any graphics.
[367:57.79]No graphics.
[367:58.19]Layer two, layer three.
[367:58.97]Layer one, layer two, layer one.
[368:00.09]Let's try this one more time.
[368:01.21]There we go.
[368:24.55]Alright.
[368:24.79]It's a pizza stain board.
[368:25.89]That board sucks.
[368:26.45]No, it doesn't.
[368:27.23]It's brick.
[368:27.85]It's brick with blood and stuff.
[368:29.65]It looks like...
[368:55.71]right the mythical lost pizza board you're just jealous Eric gets to go to Moscow instead of you I got more important things to worry about than Eric like maybe you could just say
[369:11.90]Nice work, guys.
[369:12.58]Nice job.
[369:13.34]Sponsors, man.
[369:14.24]They have to have a shoe.
[369:16.52]Why do they all just walk around town?
[369:39.82]Just the random NPC sponsors that are just in your city just walking around waiting to give you money.
[369:53.85]Just do a cool trick.
[369:55.43]Does this work for magicians too?
[369:59.60]Ditch?
[370:01.38]Why can I ditch the car?
[370:08.27]I can't ditch.
[370:08.95]Oh.
[370:09.21]Well now I'm a pro, I have a limo.
[370:11.93]Learn to drive.
[370:13.42]Why did they spawn me here?
[370:15.96]Driving your own limo.
[370:38.79]That's kinda stupid, isn't it?
[370:42.30]Halfpipe!
[370:42.84]Nice trick.
[370:46.26]Alright, let's do something.
[370:48.84]Show off your skills!
[370:50.92]We need to see something edgy before we'll give you a shoe.
[370:54.56]Tell you what, let's see you clear all the spines of Superior Court.
[370:58.69]Clear all the spines?
[371:00.39]One... Two... And three.
[371:10.50]What do you mean, like, this?
[371:14.46]Come on.
[371:16.58]That counts, right?
[371:17.38]Come on up here.
[371:24.80]Come on.
[371:26.20]Now you're gonna stand.
[371:32.06]Now you're gonna stand.
[371:49.47]Restart?
[371:50.65]No.
[371:50.75]Let's get off the board and walk.
[371:56.85]Alright, come on.
[372:02.76]There we go.
[372:03.64]Now that the shoe guys are into me, Todd says I'm on board for the next tour.
[372:08.52]Dude, you're gonna miss that bus.
[372:11.07]What?
[372:11.29]My shoes!
[372:11.73]And my socks!
[372:12.85]My shoes and my socks.
[372:51.16]Why am I doing tricks?
[372:52.80]I don't know.
[372:53.58]I don't know.
[373:01.63]I just want to.
[373:05.15]Son of a what?
[373:06.85]No, I need my trophy.
[373:12.85]Get your Slam City trophy.
[373:14.33]Excuse me, I gotta...
[373:28.60]Hits the bus, right?
[373:33.78]What?
[373:43.79]Do I have to beat the bus to Moscow?
[373:45.70]Stop that bus!
[373:55.59]I can't get- Why didn't he break?
[374:04.30]Oh, I just didn't get to the end.
[374:21.49]I thought stop the bus.
[374:22.61]I'm like, stand in front of it.
[374:28.99]I didn't know that stop the bus meant to skate over through the level out of the level.
[374:37.06]Mother Russia, home of borscht, potatoes, and the world's biggest skate demo ever.
[374:42.34]All the press will be here looking for this year's best new pro.
[374:45.64]Now the demo doesn't start for a few days, okay?
[374:48.32]So stay the hell out of trouble.
[374:55.17]Is this emulated or is it on console?
[374:56.77]This is actually on console.
[375:00.33]An Xbox 360 Slim with an official Xbox 360 hard drive in it.
[375:05.89]You have to have one of those.
[375:06.83]Don't make the mistake I did.
[375:09.78]And it's just the original disc for Xbox.
[375:14.58]Welcome to Russia.
[375:24.29]Hey, American.
[375:26.13]Some nosy American company installed cameras on our buildings for this contest.
[375:35.26]Cameras?
[375:37.18]We Russians value privacy and would like them knocked out.
[375:40.46]Why don't you do it?
[375:41.96]Holy fuck.
[375:42.50]That guy almost ran into her.
[375:45.24]Alright, knock down the cameras.
[375:46.52]Why don't they go that way?
[375:53.90]How many got there?
[376:21.26]Did I miss it?
[376:21.62]I guess it's just gotta stay on the grind.
[376:32.77]Oh, it's up there, holy shit.
[376:46.47]Damn, how do I get up there?
[376:48.07]Hold on a second, how do I get up there?
[376:54.05]Is that a wall ride?
[376:56.53]From...
[377:20.92]There it is.
[377:29.83]But, not quite, I didn't get the other one below it.
[377:32.69]Wait.
[377:34.99]Did I?
[377:35.73]No.
[377:45.65]Okay, yep, I see it, I see it.
[377:47.15]It's right after that.
[377:56.64]More here
[378:12.40]Ooh, I thought that was gonna be the end.
[378:14.63]That's not the end.
[378:16.75]Fuck, that's not the end.
[378:17.89]I gotta keep going.
[378:18.61]It's one line.
[378:19.35]Holy shit.
[378:42.82]Sorry, I got it.
[378:46.34]How do I get up on this without... Hold on.
[378:54.62]Fuck.
[378:55.84]Get off the board and just punch it!
[378:59.91]This one's fucking hard.
[379:12.18]There it is.
[379:13.40]Got it.
[379:14.60]Is it more?
[379:15.18]No.
[379:15.26]Okay, there we go.
[379:23.03]What?
[379:23.55]What?
[379:23.77]What?
[379:24.01]What?
[379:24.31]What?
[379:24.65]Where?
[379:25.09]What?
[379:25.53]Wait, wait, wait.
[379:26.55]What?
[379:27.23]There's another?
[379:27.75]There's more.
[379:29.19]Didn't it say completed?
[379:32.33]Wait, what was the green?
[379:34.47]Oh, okay.
[379:35.11]I saw the big green.
[379:36.03]Green!
[379:36.85]And I looked over.
[379:37.39]I was just done.
[379:43.89]I thought that was it.
[379:44.71]I thought I just saw the big green text.
[379:46.06]I'm like, alright, there's the line.
[379:46.90]Lost it.
[379:47.24]I wonder what the fuck is this now.
[379:59.14]Are you fucking kidding me?
[380:15.38]What?
[380:16.52]Where is it?
[380:23.48]Holy shit, dude.
[380:24.20]What's the transfer here?
[380:25.14]I don't see the transfer.
[380:55.30]got it holy okay that was hard my tank crews are ready to roll in seconds how fast can you get ready to skate when you're not even on your board show us that tank's a little high so I'll caveman onto it hope you aren't too fond of the camo paint job
[381:22.61]Caveman grind?
[381:23.41]Well, I'm gonna lose 400 rubles because I don't know what a caveman grind is.
[381:25.47]Oh.
[381:25.57]That's a caveman grind.
[381:47.41]Is he just jumping off?
[381:49.67]Like, with the... Oh, a caveman is you just built when you put the board back on.
[381:54.42]My dad.
[381:56.06]My dad.
[381:57.32]I don't know.
[382:03.18]Stop, please.
[382:14.63]Why is this the hardest thing so far?
[382:24.23]There's one.
[382:26.43]Caveman a tank and a 20,000 point combo.
[382:29.40]They said fuck this mission by the way.
[382:32.80]Really?
[382:38.50]I- what?
[382:47.53]Suck.
[383:03.81]Fuck.
[383:04.65]Ah, my hands are sweating.
[383:10.37]Nope.
[383:13.43]I'm losing all my Ruples, I know.
[383:20.09]It's actually very, very hard to control the character.
[383:22.35]When you're standing on the tank, your movement changes.
[383:26.38]Like, I'm holding... It's just weird.
[383:28.72]It's almost like the character's... See, I'm holding the buttons down.
[383:31.54]I'm not running anymore.
[383:32.44]It's kind of odd.
[383:33.02]I'm just walking instead.
[383:36.56]Weird.
[383:40.28]It's like I'm walking in quicksand right now.
[383:41.64]20,000 points.
[383:48.36]I can do it.
[384:03.08]Fuck.
[384:06.90]Alright, now I understand what somebody said when they said, fuck this mission.
[384:10.44]Now I get what you're saying.
[384:23.15]Did I get it?
[384:26.91]What about the other one?
[384:27.99]This one here.
[384:29.03]This one's firing.
[384:36.76]Oh, fuck.
[384:39.92]There's a much better line here.
[384:41.24]There's nothing over off that one.
[384:48.19]There we go.
[384:48.53]There it is.
[384:54.23]That was only 15!
[384:54.75]Fuck!
[385:14.86]Damn it.
[385:15.80]I'm starting to become greasy again.
[385:17.05]Can caveman any part of the tank?
[385:22.49]Are you fucking serious?
[385:26.47]Why am I doing the hardest part?
[385:31.31]What?
[385:32.05]No, I can't.
[385:33.67]Oh, come on.
[385:34.97]Why is my brain so sprained?
[385:39.03]Oh, I got a caveman up the nose of the tank.
[385:41.89]Oh my god.
[385:43.43]What a waste of fucking time.
[385:45.47]Let's do a combo.
[386:02.44]Ah.
[386:21.09]That's it.
[386:21.55]You just gotta get something going and then run back.
[386:24.17]Because it keeps your combo when you run off like that.
[386:26.63]There we go.
[386:27.39]That's it.
[386:48.87]Why would I caveman first when I can just get off the... Skater?
[386:55.41]You just have to... You just have to have done a caveman.
[386:58.53]At some point in the combo.
[386:59.49]So I might as well just do the combo first, and then just do the caveman.
[387:02.27]Because it's easier, because I can just get off the fucking... Scooter.
[387:05.79]If you're in the middle of a combo, and you get off the skateboard... You have... Like, five seconds with the, uh... Combo meter still going.
[387:17.91]Okay.
[387:33.33]Get special and then put special over it.
[387:36.51]Why do I need special?
[387:39.70]Get special and some speed first.
[387:41.28]Okay.
[387:41.58]Now, let's go over the wall.
[387:43.50]Let's go over this wall.
[387:44.90]Behind us.
[387:45.20]Special makes you faster for some reason.
[387:47.28]Does it really?
[388:03.47]Alright, let me get some speed.
[388:06.75]Here we go.
[388:08.11]Oh, what's wrong with that?
[388:28.63]I'm not going for it.
[388:35.10]Are we sneaking into the Kremlin right now what are we doing?
[389:06.36]Oh my god, really?
[389:07.96]Can't believe we just got a Deez Nuts kill.
[389:36.12]only two more take a swap hello that was some sweet kung fu one last thing to do bam never has any clothes on why get up that ladder and ring those bells easy
[389:54.64]We think the guards will run out and open the gates.
[389:56.90]Yeah, it's a long shot.
[389:58.45]Oh, yeah.
[389:59.73]Don't get shot.
[390:02.13]Ring the bell.
[390:02.87]Ring the bell.
[390:03.67]Oh, God.
[390:03.85]Caveman.
[390:20.53]Those suckers open the gates.
[390:22.25]I love it when a plan comes together.
[390:23.93]Alright.
[390:26.47]Trekking along.
[390:28.89]Hmm, tanks.
[390:37.20]Oh, tank.
[390:37.88]Look at these tanks.
[390:39.90]Damn, look at these tanks.
[390:41.90]It's probably pretty cold out here.
[390:43.26]Stoked by getting best new pro?
[390:45.50]Well, it's not a done deal yet.
[390:47.62]It's pretty close between me and Eric.
[390:50.30]What?
[390:51.02]No, we're gonna get... We're gonna get fucking double-crossed again.
[391:19.96]Chapter 21.
[391:20.62]Time to skate, comrade.
[391:24.10]Christmas in Moscow?
[391:35.15]Manuals for Moscovites.
[391:36.95]I was waiting for it.
[391:38.73]Somebody just went, what the fuck?
[391:50.29]I know we've done that a lot tonight, but it's funny every time because there's new people that experience it every time.
[391:57.46]That's what makes it so much better.
[392:07.56]Here we go, manuals.
[392:08.46]Should we be concerned about tanks pointing at us?
[392:12.30]More.
[392:36.85]Ooh, that was broken, but okay.
[392:38.31]Wait, we have something up here.
[392:41.61]I'm gonna get blasted with a tank shell.
[392:43.44]That would be...
[392:59.66]Tony Hawk, what do you need?
[393:00.52]Special move!
[393:29.99]I'm not doing the flush.
[393:31.15]We can't pull out the flush every five seconds.
[393:35.66]It loses its comedic value if you do it too many times.
[393:40.42]So...
[393:44.35]Find some gaps.
[393:45.39]Find five gaps.
[394:08.55]three and a half minutes to do this.
[394:10.23]I mean, is this a gap?
[394:14.07]That's kind of a gap.
[394:20.22]I don't know who that is.
[394:22.50]Crackhead?
[394:23.24]I mean, that's a gap.
[394:47.56]I feel like I'll be searching around for like 20 minutes.
[394:53.81]I don't wanna do that one.
[394:54.67]Does she- do they not have animated eyes?
[394:59.55]What are her eyes?
[395:13.87]More manuals?
[395:14.58]Get a 20,000 point manual combo.
[395:16.60]Easy.
[395:17.76]That's the easiest thing I've done all night.
[395:20.48]I like that pipe.
[395:21.24]Let me try that.
[395:23.12]Nice.
[395:51.27]Hey, what's the deal?
[395:52.50]You've been avoiding me since you got here.
[395:55.04]We're on the same team, you know.
[396:22.27]Come on, man.
[396:23.65]That's ancient history.
[396:25.27]We're pros now.
[396:25.99]Let's put that behind us.
[396:26.87]Why is this guy talking like the ShamWow dude?
[396:28.62]Good show for the locals.
[396:30.10]Cool.
[396:30.44]50,000 points.
[396:33.98]I think I get it.
[396:35.90]I can do it better than that.
[396:42.43]What just happened?
[396:46.13]That's still... Do I still have that on my bar?
[396:58.24]Hold on, I can get better than that.
[396:59.77]Hold on, itchy.
[397:06.45]Yeah, it's still on the bar.
[397:07.61]It's still on my bar.
[397:09.07]Yes, I'm using MMO terms right now, but you know what I'm saying.
[397:16.48]Where's the DPS?
[397:17.86]I only have to do one more thing.
[397:20.38]Ratings, stunts.
[397:41.24]Should be easy with all the reporters around.
[397:44.38]Try to score big points around them while they're broadcasting.
[397:50.54]Unreal TV is doing a story under Lennon's statue about him coming back to life as a robot.
[397:55.88]NSBC is doing a corruption story near St.
[397:58.46]Basil.
[397:59.20]We're gonna do crazy shit over here, right?
[398:00.88]On each one of these.
[398:01.66]After that, Channel 9 is interviewing some actress in front of the armory.
[398:05.44]Now go rip it up at those spots and you're bound to get on TV.
[398:12.26]Alright.
[398:14.84]Oh, you are on camera.
[398:22.14]Sorry, I got 16,000.
[398:22.56]Alright.
[398:23.02]I don't really like the scan lines all over my screen.
[398:40.02]Alright, I just destroyed that.
[398:41.78]Is it possible that you could create a character that looks normal?
[398:44.58]What is the fun in that, though?
[398:45.56]What is the fun in that?
[398:48.58]Get 10,000 in double tricks.
[399:09.56]I just broke out of the glass.
[399:13.54]Wait, does he do that too?
[399:30.59]Alright, we just did that.
[399:52.77]Why am I doing these?
[399:54.28]I feel like these are... The points are much easier to attain here.
[400:07.07]He did not do any of that correctly.
[400:08.59]Well, yeah, I did.
[400:09.17]I just had to get points when he was getting points, too.
[400:11.53]We got points together at the same time.
[400:12.93]Double points!
[400:15.59]What's up?
[400:17.61]Me and Vladimir here are feeling good tonight.

[401:19.08]Come on, Eric.
[401:20.74]Dude, Eric, come on, man.
[401:22.43]Open this thing.
[401:23.37]Let me out.
[401:24.63]Man, come on.
[401:27.97]Eric!
[401:32.11]I missed the competition?
[401:33.03]Is that what happened?
[401:33.53]When I saw him steal the guard's keys, I knew he was up to something stupid.
[401:37.23]Now, I tried to stop him, but he wouldn't listen.
[401:39.89]God damn it, Eric.
[401:43.47]There's $700,000 in damages you're responsible for, no?
[401:47.76]Okay.
[401:48.06]I'm now stuck in Moscow.
[402:22.03]The first thing I do when I get out, I don't call my mom.
[402:25.26]I do a manual combo.
[402:27.26]Alright, how do I get out of here?
[402:49.19]How do I activate?
[402:51.06]Here it is.
[402:55.28]What do we got for goals?
[403:00.00]An anonymous caller.

[403:22.58]That was him on the phone Oh boy That was bad All the way around
[403:51.07]I'm supposed to take it off a bar and I can't.
[404:11.45]Anytime you play a game like this, you just get so... You get so perfectionist.
[404:16.12]You just want to do everything so good and so perfect, and if you do it wrong even a little bit, you're like, no, no, no, do it again, do it again, do it again, do it again.
[404:21.19]I don't want to... No, do it again, do it again.
[404:43.83]Stop doing tricks.
[404:46.99]It's like going to McDonald's and somebody's in the backseat going, don't eat any hamburgers.
[404:52.16]Hold her a salad.
[405:12.30]Do spins over the roof.
[405:13.94]The electromagnetic forces you create will disable the tower.
[405:18.56]Okay.
[405:19.36]Spins over the roof.
[405:21.30]Dr. Tesla.
[405:22.16]Alright.
[405:22.78]Gotta go over 15 spins.
[405:25.43]Alright, hold on.
[405:43.39]Holy shit.
[405:44.35]I feel like this is gonna be hell.
[405:45.70]Is this the only one I have to do it to?
[405:49.06]Or are they all over the place?
[405:59.19]Wait, let me get off the board.
[406:02.83]Is there more than one or is it just these two?
[406:05.01]It's just these two, huh?
[406:06.27]15 full spins with supply and transfer.
[406:07.53]Do the flush?
[406:08.25]I don't think that counts.
[406:25.87]I don't know why.
[406:26.45]Why did it go the other way?
[406:29.97]See?
[406:30.35]Like, why is it doing that?
[406:31.19]What are you doing?
[406:44.04]Alright, I gotta go straight because this is just such a small disorienting area.
[406:48.52]They say stop, stop, stop, stop.
[406:50.00]Back and forth.
[406:50.54]Back and forth.
[406:51.40]Straight over.
[406:52.15]God.
[407:05.40]Flush is going to save you.
[407:06.36]No, it's not.
[407:07.35]It's actually 360 spins.
[407:08.87]Watch.
[407:09.07]Ready?
[407:09.41]It's not what you think.
[407:10.21]It's not what you think.
[407:11.09]I have to use the analog here.
[407:12.85]Because that's going to keep happening.
[407:16.91]15 fucking times.
[407:39.20]I'm gonna go over.
[407:46.54]Wash.
[407:47.88]Wash is gonna be hard to do.
[407:49.22]It's not gonna do it!
[407:50.96]Trust me!
[407:53.24]It's not gonna do what you think it is.
[408:03.00]Spining over and hitting down, down, B is actually fucking hard to do.
[408:10.92]trying to earn a living who are you
[408:45.09]Alright, no, no, that's not even the controller.
[408:46.89]He's spinning back.
[408:48.05]Why?
[408:49.31]Why is he going the other way?
[408:51.54]When I go to more than 540, he goes the other way.
[408:54.42]I don't know why it's happening.
[408:55.96]That shouldn't be happening.
[409:02.28]See?
[409:02.66]What the fuck was... What is going on there?
[409:04.32]Why is that happening?
[409:05.86]What is it... Why is it doing that?
[409:16.27]Something weird is going on here.
[409:19.51]Something weird going on here.
[409:21.49]One more try.
[409:21.91]Okay.
[409:25.55]Get me out of this.
[409:28.53]I don't want to do this one.
[409:29.91]I have to do it.
[409:31.77]I have to do it.
[409:34.40]I have to do three of them all.
[409:39.98]I'm not holding the triggers.
[409:40.78]I have to hold the triggers to go over the... Is that what's happening?
[409:43.83]Because I have to hold both triggers to go over the satellites.
[409:47.77]So I have to be holding them in the first place.
[409:51.55]Wait, I don't have to hold them?
[409:53.55]I just tap them?
[409:54.11]Where's my clothes?
[409:58.31]Why am I naked?
[410:09.10]Alright, pick the boss up.
[410:10.20]Uh, Arrow freaked me out a little bit.
[410:12.12]A lot of random car levels.

[410:44.18]Okay, that was weird.
[410:45.06]Do it again.

[411:51.76]Where are you?
[411:52.42]Like, up here?
[412:01.62]I, surprisingly enough, I didn't hit anybody.
[412:11.06]Nobody got injured there.
[412:12.92]I was fine.
[412:19.80]Not this shit.
[412:21.42]Go get her, okay?
[412:29.37]Simpsons hit and run all over again.
[412:30.77]Even the timer is similar.
[412:37.37]Jesus, there's another person.
[413:01.52]Rita?
[413:05.03]Lariska called for a ride.
[413:10.69]Can't you guys all be in the same spot?
[413:22.54]How many people can fit in a car?
[413:23.88]Oh, there it is.
[413:24.44]Alright.

[414:27.48]There we go, let's do it.
[414:28.60]Okay, yep, that's exactly what was happening to me.
[414:31.12]I hate this area.
[414:52.91]it's just it's too it's like so claustrophobic
[415:18.88]Why is Cookie Monster sometimes talking?
[415:47.22]watching this makes me sick playing it also does as well I feel your pain
[416:10.85]You didn't read chat's joke?
[416:12.15]You made your own -2 joke?
[416:14.65]I asked a question.
[416:15.48]What are you talking about?
[416:16.22]I asked a question.
[416:17.16]Where is that Cookie Monster voice coming from?
[416:18.96]Remember, that wasn't a very good joke.
[416:20.92]It was a question, sir.
[416:50.22]One of these Darius drones is going to fucking snap.
[416:54.46]Why?
[416:55.12]Why do you think that?
[416:56.54]Why do you think that?
[416:57.48]Is there any particular reason why you think that?
[417:03.73]Do explain.
[417:04.37]I'd like to know your hypothesis.
[417:16.40]Alright, one more.
[417:19.61]No, no, no, no, why?
[417:20.59]You're not gonna complete this one?
[417:49.22]I have to.
[417:49.68]Aspirin.
[417:52.69]Water.
[417:52.85]Vitamin A. Vitamin D. Dog poo.
[417:53.97]What was it?
[418:19.94]Where is it?
[418:24.00]Need more pink stuff.
[418:29.75]I see it up there.
[418:35.39]No!
[418:36.01]Stop.
[418:36.75]Grab it.
[418:42.20]Ouch.
[418:55.79]Get off the bike.
[418:57.75]Skate it.
[419:01.64]Whatever.
[419:04.18]Actually, just climb up is probably easier.
[419:15.89]Feeling stronger over here.
[419:25.21]Whoa, I just got sucked into a black hole there.
[419:28.19]Hold on.
[419:39.76]Up.
[419:41.72]Fuck, I gotta get up.
[419:45.95]Can I jump up here?
[419:46.61]I don't think so.
[419:50.33]I got it.
[419:51.05]I just glitched into the wall and got it.
[420:06.44]Alright, get out of here.
[420:13.75]I can't grab that one.
[420:19.89]Where's there a line that I can get up here from?
[420:21.65]This way?
[420:24.78]Ooh, shit.
[420:25.64]Hold on.
[420:27.08]Do I have to get up there?
[420:35.28]Fuck.
[420:36.38]Not good.
[420:43.93]Um... Shit.
[420:47.91]Get up there!
[420:59.82]Is there another way to get up here besides having to jump up here?
[421:04.06]Hold on.
[421:10.76]Up here?
[421:11.10]Hold on, let me see.
[421:22.78]No.
[421:24.44]I have to make- I have to jump across it.
[421:25.88]Shit.
[421:38.07]No!
[421:39.55]No!
[421:40.21]I'm so close to- just get off the bike.
[421:42.17]I keep going on the bike.
[421:43.35]This is what seven hours of screaming does to your brain.
[421:58.56]No, I'm gonna have to do it again.
[422:08.24]Stay up here!
[422:09.00]No!
[422:13.85]I'm trying to just jump over it.
[422:15.19]Let's do it again.
[422:16.67]Okay.
[422:30.53]I had it too.
[422:32.74]Cleaner this time.
[422:33.82]You don't even have to touch them.
[422:35.62]I like that.
[423:01.24]I gotta get some water.
[423:05.32]I gotta drink some water.
[423:07.60]It's blending together.
[423:10.38]The world's blending together.
[423:11.50]I gotta get some water.
[423:16.11]All tricks are becoming the same trick.
[423:18.53]And all lines are the same line.
[423:21.83]It's water time.
[423:22.63]Hey, remember the guy that wrote in all caps, you're never going to beat this mission?
[423:43.23]Alright, let's go
[424:26.90]I'm in the middle of a really, really hard mission.
[424:30.40]Just hold on a second.
[424:40.62]Oh my god, stop getting stuck on every polygon.
[424:47.94]There it is!
[424:48.51]Got it.
[424:49.25]No!
[424:49.57]I was on it.
[424:53.99]Why did I have to jump?
[424:56.56]Fuck.
[424:57.42]No.
[424:58.84]No.
[425:06.61]I gotta go up around that again.
[425:08.05]It's the only way to do it.
[425:09.93]I have to get back around.
[425:11.61]I don't like this area.
[425:12.69]Oh.
[425:26.72]This is my least favorite level in the game so far.
[425:28.84]I have to get on this and then I make it from
[425:55.93]I have to just jump to jump the tower.
[425:57.15]I have to just jump over this tower.
[425:59.13]Like, I have to just jump it.
[426:01.73]So I can get over here.
[426:02.67]Is there a ladder over there?
[426:04.20]Is there?
[426:04.54]Seriously?
[426:04.86]I don't even see it.
[426:31.72]Okay, get me the fuck over here.
[426:33.78]Get off the, get off, get off.
[426:34.90]Where is it?
[426:35.48]Oh my god, I'm gonna scream into this microphone and fucking blow out my vocal cords.
[426:38.90]God damn it!
[427:14.18]That was horrible.
[427:21.11]I know the boss, Alexander, will help you out.
[427:23.77]Take this bag.
[427:24.91]Bring it to Alexander.
[427:26.27]Don't look inside.
[427:30.69]Don't let any of the guards see you with it either.
[427:33.52]They are on the walls.
[427:34.82]And there are many more in the streets.
[427:36.50]Alright, now that I can focus.
[427:40.66]You made it into the cave.
[427:43.12]cave of the greasy fucking mad streamer.
[427:46.38]What questions do you have for me?
[427:58.01]Alexander is near St.
[427:59.29]Basil's.
[428:00.07]It is the pointy thing you don't remember.
[428:10.87]Bye.
[428:14.64]Get me out of Moscow!
[428:17.58]I don't like that wall!
[428:19.12]I don't like that wa- Oh, there's the ladder that everyone was telling me about.
[428:22.01]Shit.
[428:42.45]Oh, you can't, like, punch?
[428:43.93]I can't, like, jump on them and knock them down?
[428:47.95]What, I can't knock them down?
[428:49.33]I can't, like, run into them with my skateboard?
[428:54.12]Is that a stealth mission?
[428:55.86]Oh, great.
[429:01.58]Just go around that guard.
[429:02.80]What?
[429:20.55]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[429:21.95]I can't stop.
[429:23.01]I can't.
[429:23.91]I'm gonna be in big trouble if I fuck this up.
[429:27.54]Is there a guard down there?
[429:31.48]Can I skate this?
[429:37.05]Fuck.
[429:55.76]I did it.
[429:56.10]You look horrifying.
[429:57.84]Come on.
[429:59.06]Come on, give me a... Come on, man.
[430:24.14]I walked into your room one day when you were sitting there playing a game and I just like knocked on the door and you're in the dark and you turn and I just go, you look fucking horrible.
[430:33.81]I gotta close the door.
[430:42.06]Well, look who's here.
[430:44.26]I was hoping to see you.
[430:46.22]I never got to thank you for handing me best new pro back in Russia.
[430:49.90]You still don't get it.
[430:51.44]No, homie.
[430:52.34]I got it all.
[430:53.40]My own company, six cars in my garage, a record deal in the world.
[430:56.88]Russia to New Jersey?
[430:57.94]How long is that flight?
[430:59.77]Go ahead.
[431:00.27]Keep telling yourself you're happy.
[431:02.09]But it ain't about the money.
[431:03.51]I can't believe I'm wasting my time with this jackass.
[431:06.05]He probably skates for minimum wage.
[431:08.61]See ya.
[431:11.94]You'll see.
[431:12.54]I'm not going anywhere.
[431:13.80]I still got a few real friends left.
[431:17.27]Like Tony Hawk.
[431:19.13]He gives me a stomach ache.
[431:20.77]I can't believe kids will look at Eric and think that's what skating is about.
[431:24.85]Look, you gotta deal if you wanna make it as a pro.
[431:27.94]Man, I just want to skate like the old days.
[431:30.54]It used to relax me, not stress me out.
[431:33.68]That's your deal, man.
[431:35.62]Skating is whatever you make it.
[431:37.66]It didn't change.
[431:39.06]You're the one that changed.
[431:40.80]Now go skate.
[431:42.17]You'll remember why you started in the first place.
[431:45.33]Oh no, he hates skating now.
[431:49.55]He hates skating.
[431:53.22]He used to love skating.
[431:55.12]Good to see you again.
[431:56.96]How's that whole life been working out for you?
[432:01.32]Hey, Sean.
[432:02.40]Going okay.
[432:03.56]About to get a lot better.
[432:04.78]I'm gonna make a comeback.
[432:06.76]Check out this new trick I invented.
[432:10.52]Damn, you are shooting for a comeback.
[432:12.60]Do I get to show him?
[432:15.74]Let's see it.
[432:32.77]That's the canon one that I invented.
[432:37.77]Oh, that's so stupid.
[432:48.81]That's so much worse than mine.
[432:50.11]Mine's way better.
[433:03.36]very trick welcome you can create yes I know modify my trick now you're gonna see it
[433:37.74]That's the funniest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life.
[433:42.66]But it shouldn't be.
[433:43.48]That shouldn't be the funniest thing ever.
[433:55.12]Okay, so we're back in New Jersey.
[434:00.27]Ready to go.
[434:09.10]And the first thing, what do we have to do here?
[434:12.49]Combo the entire city.
[434:16.83]Combo the whole city.
[434:56.33]Oh man, this is going to be tricky.
[435:04.76]I'm going to jump off.
[435:09.22]I hate this because I was bad at this.
[435:14.92]This game is not easy.
[435:17.30]It's a funny hot game which is kind of challenging.
[435:20.36]7 out of 10.
[435:35.94]I want to get some water too.
[435:36.81]I forgot.
[435:37.35]I really need it.
[435:39.79]Yeah.
[435:40.55]I'm starting to get a little hydration deprived.
[435:45.22]I'll be right back.
[435:46.36]Get some more.
[440:40.87]Okay.
[440:44.08]I'm fully hydrated.
[440:51.68]I drank a full glass.
[440:54.80]I'm ready to go.
[441:00.36]Ready?
[441:00.56]Oh, this is the power of hydration.
[441:06.09]It hasn't gotten in my bloodstream yet.
[441:07.43]Hold on.
[441:17.67]My manual's dropping so hard.
[441:18.81]That manual's just dumpin'.
[441:21.15]I don't even need to start there.
[441:22.74]That's a shitty line to start on.
[441:23.88]Sorry.
[441:25.74]Wait.
[441:27.58]Oh, only five seconds!
[441:28.94]That's... Oh, God!
[441:30.24]Okay.
[441:34.25]Next time.
[441:34.71]Can you...
[441:51.30]That's kind of like a trap.
[441:52.38]I feel like that's a trap.
[441:54.39]Oh, there we go.
[442:07.27]There it is.
[442:08.59]No!
[442:08.77]Alright, you just have to hold it.
[442:13.61]You stay on it.
[442:15.31]Stupid fucking flip.
[442:20.53]Oh, that manual is going to be hard to hold.
[442:22.45]That was almost really cool.
[442:27.64]Almost.
[442:35.55]Oops.
[442:53.14]Ah, I didn't hit it.
[442:57.92]Get off the board?
[442:58.56]Yeah, that's true.
[442:59.46]I can do that.
[443:00.08]Let's see if I can get it in one go, though.
[443:03.87]Currently addicted.
[443:06.47]Alright, I got it.
[443:24.14]Why are you not facing me?
[443:25.00]Look at me.
[443:32.47]He didn't even want to look at me.
[443:34.37]I just did the sickest combo ever.
[443:37.55]Five community subs from pal6.
[443:39.03]Thanks, pal6.
[443:39.31]I like it.
[443:39.73]Now let's find some guys who share our same philosophy.
[443:53.43]I'm on it.
[443:54.15]I'll track down the best pros and sign them up.
[443:56.79]Perfect.
[443:57.29]And all we need to do is find a great name for our team.
[444:00.74]Name the team.
[444:01.58]Okay.
[444:03.40]Before any of these other guys are going to want to join, they're going to want to know that I'm still for real.
[444:09.25]I'm guessing with everything that's been going on, most people have forgotten.
[444:13.61]Well, I guess I'll just have to remind everyone.
[444:44.84]That reminds her of what?
[444:45.77]Because I fell off?
[444:49.09]I just wanted to turn around.
[444:54.31]Oh my god.
[445:01.47]This guy's made out of... This guy's made out of rubber bands.
[445:06.30]For the love of god, I keep kicking the shit out of this guy.
[445:11.72]I feel so bad.
[445:13.08]You used to blow out tricks left and right.
[445:15.75]What?
[445:16.19]Sure, I'll fill you.
[445:17.11]Give me the camera.
[445:17.95]Let's do it.
[445:18.57]Ready?
[445:19.03]You pull off the tricks, I'll snag it.
[445:22.29]Now I heard that heaven is a half pipe.
[445:24.23]Well, that's only half right.
[445:25.73]You had to skateboard to find your heaven on this Earth.
[445:28.69]Nail all the tricks.
[445:30.13]I'm on somebody's air conditioner.
[445:38.48]Now they got platinum chains to match their rank.
[445:42.77]Understand I'm not here.
[445:44.27]I'm just saying that it's strange that a soy's locked up.
[445:47.15]Tony Hawk's got the game.
[445:49.90]Wait, what?
[445:50.54]Stop, stop, stop!
[445:51.60]Do it again.
[445:53.06]Is this not low house lift?
[445:55.10]Oh, I got it, I got it.
[446:13.50]Tony Hawk's got a game.
[446:14.62]Yep.
[446:15.02]He's got a few of them.
[446:16.50]Tony Hawk 1.
[446:17.34]Tony Hawk 2.
[446:18.16]Tony Hawk 3.
[446:19.02]Tony Hawk's Underground.
[446:19.80]Tony Hawk's Underground 2.
[446:21.12]Tony Hawk's American Wasteland.
[446:22.50]Tony Hawk for the Wii.
[446:23.78]Tony Hawk for the Wii with a skateboard peripheral.
[446:26.04]What else does he have?
[446:29.20]Tony Hawk Project 8.
[446:30.72]Right?
[446:31.02]Tony Hawk 4.
[446:31.40]Right.
[446:31.62]Um...
[446:43.28]Burial?
[446:43.82]Invert to faking.
[446:45.01]How am I doing this wrong?
[446:46.71]Why am I doing this wrong?
[446:48.27]That's just a lip trick, isn't it?
[447:12.38]Switcheroo.
[447:13.02]Alright.
[447:13.28]Lip tricks always are just... You know, I've played every Tony Hawk game.
[447:17.46]I still don't really understand how a lip trick actually even works to not grind.
[447:36.46]like you know what I'm saying because I'm only I'm doing up and why but there's other tricks that I can do but these specials they might be
[448:03.72]I just try to do left and y at the same time
[448:26.98]There we go.
[448:27.92]More of this.
[448:30.42]Invert.
[448:30.96]That's a gymnast plant.
[448:32.06]Oh, invert.
[448:51.20]witcheroo there it is one foot okay it's burial I can't get this one though nose butt whatever nose whatever there it is alright it's because of the analog one second
[449:16.76]Uh, it's because I wasn't... yeah, the d-pad sucks with it, so... If I need to do a plant trick, I'll just use the analog.
[449:28.37]Alright, we got one more thing to do here, and then... what's next?
[449:41.99]score big alright a million points you're starting your own team huh I can help get the word out get some big points tearing up the city and I'll film you big points 200 000 points let's go what was that did I lose it sorry
[450:14.68]Restart Randy.
[450:15.76]I know.
[450:16.06]I'm like this with every one of these games though.
[450:19.70]There's nothing I can do about it.
[450:23.51]I feel like my balance has gotten worse.
[450:27.81]Is that even possible?
[450:29.23]No way.
[450:37.36]That just fucked me up.
[450:41.00]I have to restart.
[450:41.76]That was so bad.
[450:47.55]That move, man.
[450:48.53]I gotta get that out of here.
[450:49.79]I gotta delete that move.
[450:51.15]Alright, 80,000.
[451:07.18]We're good.
[451:09.92]Huge gift subs.
[451:11.46]Just a second.
[451:26.65]Yeah, I was trying to grab onto that.
[451:34.45]There we go.
[451:53.72]That's exactly what I want to do.
[451:55.88]It's an old secret technique.
[452:02.20]That was a lot.
[452:08.57]Hey, word is you've really been tearing it up.
[452:11.37]I hear you're starting a new team as well.
[452:14.31]This beer is Jerma getting really good at video games.
[452:17.32]You know what?
[452:17.74]That's the fucking, like, that's the comment that I like to see the most.
[452:23.08]The answer is no, though.
[452:28.10]They say you want to cut through all the bullshit.
[452:30.24]Just hook up some guys that want to see how far they can take skating.
[452:34.98]Imagine getting mad at a fart joke.
[452:37.67]Would somebody mad here?
[452:39.67]Wait.
[452:41.35]Is somebody actually upset here?
[452:42.53]Did somebody come in and say like, fuck, that's not fucking funny?
[452:48.49]Shit.
[452:49.31]Yes?
[452:49.95]Oh no.
[452:54.77]Alright, whatever.
[452:55.43]That means I'll do it three more times in a row.
[452:57.72]Pick your team members.
[453:02.94]Bam Margera, of course.
[453:07.20]Tony Hawk.
[453:10.32]And who?
[453:12.28]Tony Hawk, Bam Margera.
[453:14.52]And... This is tough.
[453:19.28]Chad Musker?
[453:22.94]Hey, Chad Musco was there when we first started.
[453:26.44]Chad Musco found us and discovered us and gave us our first gig.
[453:31.98]Chad Musco.
[453:33.46]I can do more.
[453:37.84]It's Rodney.
[453:39.94]Rodney, Rodney, Rodney, Rodney Mullen.
[453:43.18]And... Hmm.
[453:43.78]Hmm.
[453:55.13]Eric.
[453:56.95]Wait.
[453:59.83]Is that the evil Eric?
[454:01.03]Where's Mike be?
[454:06.42]That's not evil Eric, right?
[454:08.12]Alright, yeah, Eric.
[454:09.16]Eric Tom.
[454:11.62]The name of the team is going to be the Destructors.
[454:15.20]How about Questers?
[454:23.24]Crunchers.
[454:24.74]The Flush Force.
[454:25.86]Flush Force.
[454:26.48]That's good to me.
[454:48.60]Flush Force.
[454:52.13]Flush, Force, Assemble.
[454:55.07]You know what would be awesome?
[454:56.17]If I could give them different moves.
[454:58.85]Just give them all for every move.
[455:01.43]I thought... We're gonna make an escape video.
[455:04.57]But we're not gonna make some cookie cutter film where everybody is skating the same stuff.
[455:08.78]We're gonna make something bigger and better.
[455:10.94]Totally unexpected.
[455:12.64]Check this, dude.
[455:13.80]I've had this for years.
[455:16.02]I've been saving this list of secret spots since Animal Chinn.
[455:21.89]You know, it's actually... I'm supposed to do shit like that.
[455:25.51]Big apple spot challenge.
[455:26.83]Here it is.
[455:27.43]You still have your steak and cheese?
[455:38.54]Get ready to, uh... Get ready to... Here we go.
[455:42.42]I have four attempts to do this.
[455:44.32]It was a cheese steak.
[455:45.14]I just said steak and cheese.
[455:46.00]For this next part, I want to shoot just one long take.
[455:48.32]You know, get some smooth, close street skating through New York.
[455:53.27]You just reversed it.
[455:54.02]Bacon Cheese Challenge, here it comes.
[455:59.72]Every object before my film runs out.
[456:03.36]Select a teammate.
[456:05.52]Like there.
[456:24.13]It's not even my character.
[456:32.49]What?
[456:32.71]This is not even my character.
[456:34.35]Why can't it be me?
[456:40.32]I don't... I don't... This is... He handles differently!
[456:44.04]You can't make me toad the whole game and then make me play as Donkey Kong when I've never done that before!
[457:45.17]No, he doesn't have the flush.
[457:46.75]He doesn't have it.
[457:47.37]I can do this.
[458:05.88]I have four attempts.
[458:07.96]You have four attempts to do Big Spot Challenge.
[458:11.48]Sure.
[458:12.38]Go.
[458:53.65]We got 13?
[458:53.89]Not even close.
[458:54.87]Not even close.
[458:56.03]I don't want to be banned by Jayce.
[459:21.17]Come on.
[459:21.55]24 out of 44.
[459:22.19]Five.
[459:22.85]I need more time.
[459:23.77]You gotta try to get it all in one line.
[459:48.60]Or at least a lot of it in one line.
[459:50.10]27 of 44.
[459:51.28]This is definitely doable.
[459:52.02]In four attempts.
[459:52.88]Definitely not going to be this one.
[459:55.44]Yeah, that's it.
[459:57.11]Alright, this is attempt number three.
[460:12.64]Oh no, fuck.
[460:14.70]Oh.
[460:15.44]I just like literally dropped the ball.
[460:19.12]Sorry.
[460:19.52]Sorry.
[460:19.96]Okay.
[460:40.87]We'll be right back.
[461:12.07]Sprite, here we go.
[461:12.71]Didn't get it.
[461:13.15]20 more.
[461:13.29]27. 28.
[461:40.25]Turn around.
[461:42.23]You gotta do it all in one go?
[461:43.83]Yeah, I know.
[461:44.47]This is... That's hard.
[461:45.31]Alright, try it again.
[462:12.75]I don't care.
[462:13.51]You don't have to throw up your steak and cheese.
[462:16.01]You get to keep it inside your stomach where it belongs.
[462:41.97]No, okay, I gotta go up that ramp.
[462:43.89]Ah, alright, let's go.
[462:50.40]Take this.
[462:53.18]I mean, yeah, but I didn't really do it.
[463:04.37]Are they all like this?
[463:05.37]Or is this one in particular just the one that's... Is this... Do I have to... Are they all like this?
[463:10.81]Every single one of them?
[463:12.87]Or is this the... I'm going to throw up the big challenge one?
[463:17.87]This is the one.
[463:18.77]This is the one that's hard.
[463:19.81]Try it again.
[463:22.98]One line.
[463:41.99]Alright.
[463:43.03]Not bad.
[463:43.71]Not a terrible start.
[463:45.45]Could be worse.
[463:47.73]Just put a Spore and I touch that.
[464:01.98]No, I wanted to grind it.
[464:17.07]You gotta learn it.
[464:18.53]I mean, you gotta learn the entire route.
[464:22.51]Doing that in one trick?
[464:23.79]I'm sure it's on YouTube somewhere.
[464:25.21]I mean, I'm not gonna be able to do that.
[464:26.97]20.
[464:28.51]A lot of shit over here.
[465:00.83]30 out of 44.
[465:02.81]Is it every single one or you just have to get 44?
[465:04.93]Or is it all of them are 44?
[465:15.80]All of them is 44.
[465:19.08]Well... I don't think I'll be doing this one.
[465:35.88]Come on, why am I not getting over there?
[465:47.40]Nope.
[465:48.50]Nope.
[465:50.02]Nope.
[465:51.60]Nope.
[465:53.42]Nope.
[465:56.15]Nope.
[465:56.67]Wait.
[465:56.81]What?
[466:05.88]Wait, I can't leave?
[466:08.64]Why can't I?
[466:09.12]There we go.
[466:09.60]Change level.
[466:10.12]Get me out of here.
[466:13.83]End goal.
[466:17.43]Few goals.
[466:18.01]Okay.
[466:20.15]Jersey spine trickshot.
[466:22.19]Apples.
[466:23.03]Big apples.
[466:23.75]I'm not doing that one.
[466:24.99]How about slamma jamma?
[466:32.28]Let's try slamma jamma.
[466:38.58]Check it.
[466:39.14]Peralta pulled some strings and got us onto the Slam City course after hours.
[466:44.15]This setup is perfect for a real street technician.
[466:47.27]We should be able to shoot some nice long combo lines.
[466:52.16]I've only had enough footage for a set number of lines, so hit as many markers in one combo as you can.
[467:11.89]Oh, hold on.
[467:13.49]I feel like this is going to be a significant portion of the rest of this stream.
[467:28.66]Oh man.
[467:32.53]You have to do ten combos?
[467:34.19]You have nine combos.
[467:36.65]I don't understand.
[467:41.57]Nine combos I only have I have to do I get it.
[467:47.84]I have to do this in that No, oh no Am I not gonna be able to beat Tony Hawk's underground?
[468:01.86]I Was hoping we were gonna be at the last level after eight hours.
[468:04.40]Oh
[468:17.75]I'm sorry, Tony.
[468:52.12]Let me see the other ones.
[468:54.34]These are going to be so hard for me to do.
[468:56.12]How about, uh, Vancouver Spine Challenge?
[469:07.29]Those are the two hardest ones.
[469:09.39]Are they?
[469:09.69]I heard another pro tried to film the BC Spine Series and busted his collarbone.
[469:14.43]If one of you guys can pull all three spines and get a big combo, we'll have this team video made.
[469:24.31]load land spine series okay land the spine series okay let's uh just spine over this it is one well I would have had it this doesn't seem too bad
[469:59.49]Stop, you're killing him.
[470:12.80]Why can't I go forward?
[470:16.08]What the fuck?
[470:18.80]What am I doing wrong?
[470:27.35]I need more air.
[470:31.23]I'm doing... I just... I had no air on that one.
[470:37.87]I'm not holding anything.
[470:39.13]I'm just doing L and R. L and R. Oh.
[470:54.03]I get it.
[470:54.29]I get it.
[471:18.91]I'm starting to understand it, but it's fucking... L and R is killing me.
[471:23.25]Okay.
[471:23.59]L and R. Get off as a controller.
[471:45.67]I said at the height of the jump?
[471:47.64]Alright, so why am I doing the first one pretty much every single time, but I can't do this one once?
[472:02.07]Am I doing it too early?
[472:03.69]Don't jump!
[472:04.41]I mean, don't jump?
[472:07.59]Why would I not?
[472:09.39]Alright, what?
[472:10.35]Why would I not jump?
[472:20.65]Good.
[472:21.49]Now score 100,000 points.
[472:22.41]What?
[472:34.09]Now score 100,000 points.
[472:37.49]Is it timed?
[472:39.29]Wait a minute, what the fuck happened?
[472:45.33]That whole, no wait, the whole thing has to be a combo.
[472:48.73]The entire thing.
[472:52.61]Like, from here down.
[472:56.73]Oh, shit.
[472:57.89]Okay.
[472:59.38]Oh, boy.
[473:00.46]I really tacked on the fucking difficult shit at the very end of the game, huh?
[473:13.53]Alright, 100,000.
[473:13.79]I need a good line.
[473:26.49]Alright, I'm not gonna use Tony Hawk.
[473:27.97]Who's got good Street Game?
[473:38.02]Oh my god.
[473:54.35]just do manual spam?
[473:55.59]I'm still going to... Hold on.
[473:59.92]I'm going to try manual spam.
[474:02.63]Oh boy, here we go.
[474:24.69]No, no, no.
[474:25.09]Different.
[474:25.55]Do it with somebody else.
[474:26.82]I don't want Tony Hawk.
[474:29.96]Very patient car.
[474:43.53]Tony Hawk, I don't think, has the best manual game!
[474:51.00]Definitely him.
[474:53.26]Mullen's got the best game.
[474:54.30]Alright.
[474:54.48]Alright, here we go.
[475:07.46]Really?
[475:14.83]Alright, let's get some manuals.
[475:15.87]Here we go.
[475:16.13]3, 2, 1, start it.
[475:26.16]Fuck, I messed it up.
[475:43.02]Wap, wap, wap, wap, wap, wap.
[475:44.64]Alright, same thing on the road.
[475:45.94]Alright, let's go.
[475:58.58]There it is.
[475:59.06]Alright.
[475:59.80]Jesus Christ.
[476:00.78]Okay, I need to do four more.
[476:08.23]Hawaii huge spine challenge.
[476:10.55]Oh, no.
[476:11.11]No, why does it have to be spine every time?
[476:13.51]No spines.
[476:14.65]I don't want to do spines.
[476:18.07]Okay.
[476:26.38]You don't look like you're going fast enough to do this.
[476:27.87]Tony Hawk.
[476:28.39]Alright, Acid Drop.
[476:55.22]Oh, this one's kind of fun.
[476:59.52]Acid drop.
[477:07.90]Do it!
[477:13.18]Just jump over.
[477:13.72]Got it.
[477:18.88]Got it.
[477:22.51]Now what?
[477:23.95]Spine of- Now what?
[477:25.09]Spine of acid drop the four ludicrous hotel spines before time runs out.
[477:28.50]Did I not do four?
[477:29.16]Is this the little one right here?
[477:42.71]Why would that be part of it?
[477:44.85]That is-
[477:52.87]Okay, Florida Tony Hawk's Pro Skater Challenge.
[478:02.54]Okay, I've got a cool concept for someone's part.
[478:04.72]Let's do it video game style.
[478:06.40]We'll shoot four sick combo lines.
[478:10.78]First combo, you can use whatever you want.
[478:13.00]Next, only Tony Hawk 3 stuff.
[478:14.96]No spine transfers.
[478:16.42]Then, only Tony Hawk 2 stuff.
[478:18.22]No reverts or spine transfers.
[478:19.97]I don't use them anyways.
[478:20.65]Finally, only Tony Hawk 1 tricks.
[478:22.93]No manuals.
[478:24.33]No manuals.
[478:26.15]No manuals.
[478:27.35]Alright.
[478:28.65]How about Bam Margera?
[478:32.83]$30,000.
[478:35.04]Okay, but I didn't know we were going to go right now.
[478:48.12]Okay.
[478:50.16]Now, no... Okay.
[479:20.11]I'm just going to manual the first two.
[479:24.42]Alright.
[479:25.00]Bam Margera is not very good at manuals.
[479:26.88]Maybe I shouldn't do that.
[479:29.28]No, no, no, no, no.
[479:29.82]I'm going to save him.
[479:35.55]Bam Margera.
[479:37.49]You said Bam sucks?
[479:47.66]I'm trying to get over this.
[479:48.70]Bam's not good at anything.
[479:49.78]Why did I pick him?
[479:51.36]What?
[479:51.56]68,000.
[480:01.48]Alright, let's do that again.
[480:02.74]Oh, man.
[480:08.28]Alright, I'm going to have to...
[480:15.36]I can do that.
[480:15.86]I can do it.
[480:16.40]I can do it.
[480:16.78]I'm not going to rely on manuals.
[480:18.74]Just for the first one, I will.
[480:20.61]And did you see what just happened?
[480:21.55]A magnet just grabbed that.
[480:35.99]Okay, let's just do tricks.
[481:01.19]Out of bounds game?
[481:02.67]I gotta do it, Bam.
[481:12.77]I have to.
[481:21.69]Did I fall?
[481:35.32]Let's try that again.
[481:38.41]Manual's really all the way to do it.
[481:39.73]It seriously is.
[481:40.53]Oh, fuck.
[481:40.95]Okay.
[481:41.25]Now.
[481:41.49]No manuals.
[481:41.91]Damn it.
[481:42.49]I thought I had it.
[482:07.70]Manuals are allowed?
[482:08.42]Wait.
[482:10.72]That was the third time though, right?
[482:11.75]Was it Tony Hawk 3, Tony Hawk 2, Tony Hawk 1?
[482:23.55]He's bored of them, bro.
[482:26.20]Normal Tony Hawk 3, Tony Hawk 2, Tony Hawk 1.
[483:08.24]Alright.
[483:09.32]This is the one.
[483:10.82]No manual, right?
[483:12.30]This is no reverts, spine transfers, or walking.
[483:16.01]This is the last one, right?
[483:20.29]Can I still manual here?
[483:23.61]Just infinite grind.
[483:25.15]Just grind in a circle.
[483:27.69]But where... I don't know where that line is, man.
[483:30.66]Grind in a circle?
[483:34.50]Oh, I don't... Why did you guys even say that?
[483:51.81]The tree thing?
[484:03.09]The road median.
[484:15.13]That's not good!
[484:19.89]Right to my right.
[484:23.43]Forever grind.
[484:37.26]This is fun, though.
[484:39.94]I like it.
[484:40.30]It's hard, but it's not too hard for me to not be like, I don't think I can do this.
[484:51.49]Alright, I turned the wrong way.
[484:52.41]I mean, it's fucking hard, but it's not like I can't do it.
[484:59.67]I'll do it eventually.
[485:00.45]Imagine this on stick.
[485:20.86]This is the least fun part of the game.
[485:27.12]Yeah.
[485:28.22]Yeah, it is.
[485:29.56]It's still good, though.
[485:30.70]It's still fun.
[485:36.98]It's still fun.
[485:38.80]I mean, it makes you have to play well.
[485:42.69]Did you learn anything?
[485:43.93]Did you learn whatever the game is trying to teach you?
[485:50.94]It's good if you're good at the game.
[486:06.93]Yeah, sure.
[486:07.37]That's 13?
[486:07.85]That's not... no.
[486:11.41]Isn't that usually the case?
[486:12.57]Yeah, but to get good at something, don't you have to do it and play it and do it for a while?
[486:20.80]How do you get good at anything?
[486:25.12]You don't just start good at something.
[486:26.72]That's not how it works.
[486:40.45]I played all the Tony Hawk games.
[486:42.57]Yes.
[486:43.97]Yes, I did.
[486:44.39]20 years ago.
[486:47.64]And we did Tony Hawk 2 on the Dreamcast a year ago.
[486:57.53]Yes, I've played all these games before.
[486:59.35]Uh, when I was 17.
[487:16.51]There it is.
[487:17.55]Okay.
[487:18.46]Let's go.
[487:19.76]The tree.
[487:21.52]This is it.
[487:27.18]Guys.
[487:28.36]Um.
[487:30.14]This is a bad idea.
[487:30.84]This is a very bad idea.
[487:33.68]With Bam Margera.
[487:39.96]This is way too spam tricks.
[487:42.04]What do you mean spam tricks?
[487:45.96]Wait, what?
[487:56.30]Hold on.
[488:02.96]Wait, while you're grinding, I can hold X and Y and... Oh man, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do that shit.
[488:15.39]I don't know if Bam can handle that.
[488:28.78]I guess, okay, I can.
[488:29.76]I can do it.
[488:30.76]Alright.
[488:32.44]I can do it.
[488:40.42]Alright, I can do it.
[488:42.70]I'll do it on the next run.
[488:44.60]I have to get there again though.
[488:56.51]I don't think I can handle this one.
[489:02.81]Just do something!
[489:03.41]Do something!
[489:23.83]Okay, here we go.
[489:26.27]Go.
[489:47.58]San Diego Transfer Challenge.
[489:56.95]Is that how the song goes?
[489:59.61]Uh, Kostin.
[489:59.85]No!
[489:59.93]Who has good air?
[490:00.55]Kostin versus Musco?
[490:01.11]Probably Musco.
[490:28.19]Neither.
[490:33.55]Uh, trans-vert, transfer, photoshoot.
[490:35.53]No, I can do this.
[490:36.33]Just hold R. Or hit R. Okay, there's one.
[490:41.86]How many are there?
[490:43.02]A little over there.
[490:45.02]Ooh!
[490:56.18]He's praying for me.
[490:57.48]Okay.
[491:03.81]More of this way.
[491:07.73]No, there isn't.
[491:10.63]He was taking a picture to laugh at you.
[491:12.27]Funny yellow ball comedy fucking comedy moment.
[491:15.16]A little too far.
[491:24.34]I still got it?
[491:25.10]I got it.
[491:25.40]Fuck you, buddy.
[491:29.68]You're in Tony Hawk's way.
[491:31.42]Wait.
[491:33.26]Oh, do I have to... Come on.
[491:42.91]Get out of the fucking way.
[491:46.55]Matthew McConaughey is on his way.
[491:50.25]I got it.
[491:51.29]Not very good, but I still got it.
[492:05.48]Okay, let me just slow down and do this the way it should be done.
[492:08.82]Okay.
[492:25.95]Uh, so how bad is Kostin's air again?
[492:28.25]Somebody said.
[492:46.11]Uh, three more.
[492:47.13]That's where the fuck those are, though.

[492:49.67]No.

[492:50.31]I don't see any over here.

[493:17.01]Wait, what about in here?

[495:22.96]We'll just delete the cars.
[495:26.64]Two stair ones.
[495:47.78]Okay.
[495:49.14]There's another one back here.
[495:50.12]I've skated by it.
[496:02.51]Okay.
[496:03.15]Hmm.
[496:04.85]Okay.
[496:13.11]Now, go up on the roof.
[496:16.68]Over back here.
[496:18.66]Good.
[496:22.08]Was there one?
[496:22.78]Wait, is there one over here?
[496:23.66]I don't think I looked over here.
[496:32.80]Help.
[496:44.04]Why do people sing penis music?
[496:53.07]Over the roof?
[496:59.12]Just a spine transfer?
[497:17.10]Just from here to there?
[497:21.22]Just through the opening?
[497:29.33]No?
[497:30.61]That's a ramp.
[497:32.27]Not a spine train.
[497:33.05]So yeah, you're supposed to go from bird to bird.
[497:34.59]But this one?
[497:36.47]Like from here to here?
[497:38.35]It's probably that one.
[497:45.84]He's not even aiming the camera over here.
[497:51.90]Is there one on the other side?
[498:09.29]I don't get it.
[498:11.09]The roof has a ramp.
[498:12.89]What is it?
[498:13.65]Like, here?
[498:15.07]Oh, OK.
[498:15.35]That.
[498:15.55]I see.
[498:16.15]Alright, alright, alright.
[498:20.06]So I have to go.
[498:20.72]Now I know.
[498:21.36]Wasn't it?
[498:21.96]Wait.
[498:22.14]How is that not it?
[498:41.38]Other side?
[498:42.12]So you want me to go up from that side, okay.
[498:44.26]From this side.
[498:44.74]I know where it is now.
[499:10.19]Well, I've killed the photographer.
[499:12.13]There's one.
[499:12.81]That still doesn't solve the problem.
[499:18.85]There's two more somewhere.
[499:25.59]Where on Earth are the last two that I haven't seen?
[500:01.83]I didn't do the first one, but it's kind of good.
[500:03.37]I can go back and get it.
[500:04.31]That fucking car.
[500:05.17]No, fuck that car.
[500:31.80]That ruined everything.
[500:33.46]Unless I can get this one.
[500:34.38]Why would there be a mission here?
[500:59.60]I'm gonna fall again.
[501:01.03]Let's do it.
[501:01.59]Okay.
[501:01.97]Alright, now, so this way, up and in?
[501:30.94]This guy's gonna have a bad day.
[501:33.30]I did it?
[501:34.06]Did he get the photo?
[501:35.90]Did he get the photo?
[501:39.36]Okay, he got it.
[501:44.29]Now where are the last- I know one back there I didn't do, but where are the last two?
[501:47.95]Is that a photographer?
[501:53.99]No.
[502:05.50]I'm just spying up here.
[502:06.45]Oh shit.
[502:15.91]I see one there.
[502:16.65]There's nobody here.
[502:18.05]There's one up there though.
[502:22.57]Where did I see that?
[502:29.60]Wasn't that like up there?
[502:40.08]Yeah, I don't know.
[502:59.53]Oh, I'm trying to...
[503:09.65]I gotta get up here.
[503:14.08]So, I need just a few.
[503:22.68]Is one in there?
[503:23.73]Alright, in there.
[503:25.03]Was I in here already?
[503:31.09]Oh, this motherfucker's right here!
[503:32.53]Oh man, they're both right here!
[503:38.38]Alright, let's go.
[503:44.18]There's no ramp on that side.
[503:46.92]No ramp on that side.
[503:48.46]Just take it slow.
[503:53.72]I did it.
[503:57.92]Last one.
[504:00.72]Jersey spine trick spot challenge.
[504:02.97]Big apple spot challenge.
[504:05.73]Slamma jamma of Moscow's lost tapes.
[504:10.70]I'm not going to build Duke.
[504:11.52]No.
[504:11.88]There's no way.
[504:12.96]I'm not capable of that.
[504:13.88]There's no way I'll do Big Apple.
[504:15.78]I'm sorry.
[504:16.02]It's not going to happen.
[504:16.88]Alright, Moscow.
[504:17.95]Ten tapes.
[504:40.60]I feel like Cusper doesn't have very good grind.
[504:43.30]Oh boy.
[504:44.00]Oh no.
[504:45.96]How would that even happen?
[505:18.24]Don't tell me what you can't come in here with that don't tell them what like you can't come in here with that Why are you saying that?
[505:58.64]He doesn't know.
[505:59.28]I mean, I do.
[506:03.06]How do I look at a character's stats?
[506:04.52]Oh no.
[507:00.52]He's not good for this.
[507:02.89]What was Slamma Jamma again?
[507:04.31]No.
[507:05.61]Jersey Spine Trick Spot Challenge.
[507:07.35]I didn't even look at this one.
[507:16.07]Peralta was right.
[507:17.11]This old spine is a big ghetto.
[507:19.15]But it'll definitely turn heads if one of you guys can get over it.
[507:21.97]Pull these tricks as you go over it and we'll have a killer part to lead out the team video.
[507:27.36]Alright, what do I need to do?
[507:28.78]Hit the tricks over the train station's spine.
[507:40.28]Wait.
[507:44.39]Again.
[507:59.35]There's a secret level over there.
[508:10.82]Look at that.
[508:11.24]Look at that.
[508:18.92]This has got to be it.
[508:23.90]That's it.
[508:25.24]Oh, I did it.
[508:25.88]I did it.
[508:27.91]I beat Tony Hawk's Pro Skater Underground.
[508:30.51]But that didn't work.
[508:45.71]I can't even say, like... I don't know how it goes that fast.
[508:47.02]Once you do it fast enough, it stops.
[508:48.30]Let's take a look at our sick video, man.
[508:49.88]Flush Force video.
[508:50.66]Underground.
[508:51.00]Chad Muska.
[509:21.89]Oh, sick, remember when we took that photo?
[509:23.45]Nice, Tony.
[509:34.35]Sick.
[509:34.91]Oh, that was clean.
[509:53.11]yeah now do the thing where you fall forward on the front part of your neck and your legs kick you in the back of the head because we got a lot of footage of that did the editor put it in music Eric costan let's see it that is so hard it's so difficult to do this stuff
[510:28.46]That was a manual all the way.
[510:30.54]Skateboarding's fun to watch.
[510:32.44]Yeah, it's just... It's a... It's a craft.
[510:33.70]It's an art form.
[510:34.46]Wow.
[510:34.70]No fucking way.
[510:56.25]Bam let's see it oh there we go yep this is where all that footage went accurate replay remember when I rode the ATV oh shit there
[511:26.74]Remember when I drove the car like that?
[511:28.18]Nice.
[511:36.29]Do you know how much that hurts your back?
[511:43.08]Just planting from that high.
[511:52.84]Do I get one too?
[511:58.21]You gotta be kidding me.
[511:59.77]That was phenomenal.
[512:04.49]How do humans do this?
[512:13.16]Alright, this dude is a video game.
[512:17.82]Actual video game character right here.
[512:34.34]Cody Mullen is the greatest of all time in the street.
[512:37.78]Holy shit, that was awesome.
[512:40.35]I just kind of want to watch skateboarding videos now.
[513:00.56]Just those little transfers over.
[513:02.76]Little railings.
[513:06.04]It is so dangerous, but completely captivating at the same time.
[513:15.41]Uh-oh.
[513:17.63]Illegal picnic basket jump.
[513:36.79]Alright, here comes my video.
[513:39.25]Aww.
[513:42.29]Yeah, I saw him do a royal flush and he got arrested.
[513:54.32]Oh, how cute.
[513:56.40]Two little skaters and their ghetto shop.
[513:59.38]Heard your video went over pretty good.
[514:01.45]I guess kids dig that goofy soul skating crap.
[514:04.29]You blew every cent you own on that car.
[514:06.07]I'll buy you out for half a mil right now.
[514:08.11]I got my checkbook.
[514:09.47]I told you.
[514:10.79]It was never about the money.
[514:13.61]Right, right.
[514:14.23]I forgot.
[514:15.17]Mr. Pure, I should have fixed you back in Tampa.
[514:18.31]Tell it to your posse.
[514:19.97]We're through.
[514:21.23]I've got everything I need.
[514:23.46]not this remember Hawaii building cigarettes helicopter that was some sick food oh my cassette tape bad no one ever saw it you backstabbing mob flipping cockroach hey what do you say one last trip around the neighborhood winner takes the tape alright one last trip I've waited a long time gonna light you up I'm gonna light you up homie
[514:58.29]oh boy why does he have fire he's throwing like grenades at me
[515:13.41]That's not fair.
[515:14.23]I don't get grenades.
[515:15.37]Oh, shit.
[515:16.39]He's up top.
[515:17.57]Oh, boy.
[515:17.93]He's up top.
[515:43.87]He's got a hit.
[515:45.53]Jump over it.
[515:47.45]Hit the line.
[515:48.15]Over here.
[515:48.61]He's fucking schooling me right now.
[516:13.27]I mean but oh it's gonna be rough
[516:33.66]two hours later trying to jump through those giving me a lot of trouble why does he have molotovs
[516:49.97]That's a great question.
[516:51.11]To make this already difficult encounter way more difficult.
[516:58.77]Something like that.
[517:04.35]I'm gonna stop getting off that.
[517:07.47]Alright, here we go.
[517:09.55]Here we go.
[517:10.29]Jesus Christ!
[517:11.09]What?
[517:11.29]Oh no!
[517:11.49]The power lines.
[517:12.01]It's over.
[517:35.37]I don't think I can even get up there anymore.
[517:36.51]How am I supposed to hold a line for that long?
[517:48.63]Not even halfway there, either.
[517:49.97]Yeah, this is fucking rough.
[517:51.95]Two minutes, too.
[517:56.27]I'd stay up here.
[518:07.59]Did I not get it?
[518:09.03]Oh boy.
[518:16.24]Yeah, I can't get this part down to jump through.
[518:19.86]Where does he jump?
[518:20.43]He jumps right here.
[518:30.32]He hits me with that every time.
[518:31.54]Rhythm Heaven?
[518:34.47]Um... This is probably... I would probably put this... This is probably harder than Rhythm Heaven.
[518:44.79]Did I not get it?
[518:47.81]I don't think I got that one.
[518:51.22]No, I didn't.
[518:58.52]It's alright, it's safe.
[519:00.64]I'm just gonna try to stay with him.
[519:19.82]I just had to jump over it too.
[519:21.18]That thing, out of nowhere, takes up the whole screen.
[519:29.09]As long as you're in the vicinity, you get it.
[519:30.27]Here he goes.
[519:37.92]Didn't get it.
[519:38.66]Oh, man.
[519:42.12]This might, uh... I'm not sure a nine-hour stream Jeremy can beat this level.
[519:50.81]Not sure this is gonna happen.
[519:53.15]I don't know if a nine-hour stream Jeremy can complete this.
[520:02.13]I'll try it for like another 30 minutes or so.
[520:11.05]See if I can get it.
[520:20.44]Watch out.
[520:21.12]Okay.
[520:21.98]Up the wall.
[520:26.50]I think it's over.
[520:34.76]Unless I can stay.
[520:35.72]It's hard to see the wires.
[520:41.64]The wires almost just blend in with the background.
[520:43.24]I can't even see them.
[520:47.14]Level up my stats.
[520:48.80]Where are my stats?
[520:49.58]Can I even see them?
[520:53.00]Air, spin, they're all really good.
[520:57.10]Run, flip, rail.
[520:58.62]Actually, rail is really not that good.
[521:00.34]Grind for 15 seconds.
[521:02.90]Grind for 20 seconds.
[521:09.47]I haven't done that yet.
[521:11.77]Now I gotta...
[521:35.93]I don't even try.
[521:41.38]I mean, I'm gonna try.
[521:46.16]No.
[521:46.38]Remember when he abandoned you in Russia?
[521:52.55]I do, it was bad.
[522:12.70]I think nine hours straight Tony Hawk Jeremy.
[522:16.40]I think it's time to go to bed, son.
[522:18.90]You've been up all day playing Tony Hawk, son.
[522:21.82]You can beat the last level another time.
[522:25.30]No, I can do it!
[522:26.16]I can do it, Dad!
[522:29.64]Son, it's okay.
[522:33.65]You don't have to beat him right now.
[522:39.45]Missed.
[522:42.70]Shut up, Dad!
[522:52.99]Are you your own dad?
[522:54.69]Would be odd, wouldn't it?
[523:00.73]This is the part that I get caught up on every time.
[523:03.31]Up, and then ride?
[523:05.86]No.
[523:08.56]The worst thing is if you miss it, it's just over.
[523:13.28]Turn the music off.
[523:14.16]Alright, I'm going to try it without music.
[523:21.77]Just skateboard sounds.
[523:37.26]I'm just trying not to do any tricks.
[523:38.30]I'm just trying to grind and just stay... I mean, I'm not trying to do anything fancy.
[523:44.79]It's hard every time.
[523:49.37]Goes up.
[523:52.49]That.
[523:52.71]He stays on it.
[523:56.86]Come on.
[524:00.18]So he just... He doesn't jump or anything.
[524:02.16]He just stays on the line.
[524:04.08]He doesn't... It just rips him to the...
[524:09.35]I just didn't have any speed.
[524:10.19]I was going to fall off anyways.
[524:17.69]Alright.
[524:21.65]Ten more attempts and I'm going to do this tomorrow.
[524:25.39]I just... I'm out of gas, man.
[524:27.23]I just am.
[524:27.67]I'm out of gas.
[524:32.81]I was probably out of gas like 40 minutes ago, but I should be able to do this tomorrow after eating like a good breakfast.
[524:43.80]Cheats?
[524:44.28]No, I cheat.
[524:45.64]Why would I cheat?
[524:47.20]I didn't get it?
[525:03.90]You can still make it.
[525:07.56]What about Helm's Deep?
[525:09.24]That's a different kind of game, though.
[525:11.56]This requires a huge amount of concentration.
[525:17.48]Helm's Deep was just running in circles and kicking ladders.
[525:21.15]So, it's a little different.
[525:22.83]Missed it again.
[525:32.23]Just get the funny bad ending.
[525:34.81]The funny bad ending?
[525:41.08]Just do the infinite grind cheat.
[525:48.54]Six!
[525:50.96]Five!
[525:56.67]How far am I gonna go on five, son?
[526:15.04]I still... I can't... I don't reliably get it to be able to get up there.
[526:19.14]It's something to do with how I'm jumping or how... I just don't... I don't understand.
[526:32.78]Don't let the pervert skateboarder win.
[526:35.02]Did I miss that?
[526:36.91]Why am I reading chat right now?
[526:38.95]Well, I think I've clocked out.
[526:40.17]I'm just looking over there.
[526:43.73]What are people saying?
[526:44.55]Yeah.
[526:49.60]Alright, for some reason I'm like teleporting up to the top of the building instead of the pipe that I'm trying to grind on.
[527:01.50]Is another ramp to the right?
[527:04.12]I'm supposed to be doing his line, right?
[527:10.79]Am I supposed to follow him to grab these things?
[527:17.07]I'm going to grind the gutter.
[527:18.47]That's what I'm trying to do.
[527:20.09]That keeps on going up to the top of the roof.
[527:25.19]See what he does here?
[527:25.89]I did it, but... Alright, you know, I'm not going to restart.
[527:29.71]Let me just look at this.
[527:31.53]Because, like, I feel like I've done the same.
[527:32.81]He, like, rips to the right.
[527:39.49]When he gets up there, he goes like this.
[527:45.43]And he goes like... Like...
[528:03.66]it's that you got to get on it let me try that let me let me just practice alright so if I just like spam y it takes me over here
[528:31.93]Like, if I just go, like, y-y-y-y-y-y, it goes like... Just snaps to the wire.
[528:40.59]Yeah.
[528:48.96]My balance is shit, though.
[528:52.64]I need to get my rail up.
[528:54.64]Is there, like, a free skate where I can just get... Ugh.
[529:04.12]My balance is really not great.
[529:06.61]Let me try this like one or two more times.
[529:15.85]I'm going to use it.
[529:16.55]I turned it off for ultra concentration.
[529:23.23]Let's see.
[529:24.69]Alright.
[529:24.91]Same theory.
[529:26.21]So just here it is.
[529:34.66]I'm still up.
[529:35.20]I'm still up here.
[529:38.84]Now what?
[529:43.14]He goes down.
[529:45.38]And then... What does he do?
[529:52.17]Where'd he go?
[529:53.63]Where'd he go?
[529:54.11]Where the fuck is he?
[529:54.97]Okay.
[530:08.48]Where's he?
[530:09.62]Back?
[530:26.49]It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
[530:42.19]I didn't know it was going to rip that way.
[530:54.81]What the fuck are you talking about?
[530:57.14]What?
[531:01.60]How does he do that?
[531:02.88]I think I can do it.
[531:07.86]How does he get up there?
[531:09.05]Hold on.
[531:09.47]Can I stay here?
[531:14.42]Holy shit, man.
[531:15.54]You gotta be serious.
[531:16.92]Alright, let's try this again.
[531:29.38]You.
[531:32.73]I was kind of close.
[531:33.45]I think that's better than I've ever done.
[531:34.57]That might have been the only one to find out.
[531:51.84]Just get this down.
[531:54.70]I jumped over it.
[531:57.38]I'm delayed by like four tenths of a second right now.
[532:11.99]Every time that hits me.
[532:15.65]Let your older brother do it.
[532:16.79]Imagine this older brother scenario here.
[532:22.49]This would suck total asshole being the older brother in this scenario.
[532:25.89]This isn't just like jump over Bowser, little older brother.
[532:29.07]Can you just jump over Bowser and grab the axe?
[532:31.53]Yeah, of course I can, little brother.
[532:33.97]Look at me.
[532:34.75]I can do it.
[532:35.43]I'm so good at video games.
[532:37.68]Can you beat this for me, older brother?
[532:39.38]Yeah.
[532:41.34]What do you got?
[532:42.28]Need me to get another axe from dear old Bowser there?
[532:46.66]Nope.
[532:46.98]This.
[532:50.62]Oh.
[532:51.74]Let me see it.
[533:01.35]I would try it.
[533:02.43]I would try it.
[533:04.38]Here we are.
[533:07.08]I missed it.
[533:11.66]That's another wired die.
[533:13.20]I'm calling it at 9 hours.
[533:22.78]I'm calling it at 9 hours.
[533:29.01]Actually have to call it.
[533:30.33]I have to call it at 9 hours.
[533:31.73]I'll stream it tomorrow too.
[533:36.11]Like this is day 5 in a row coming up here.
[533:39.47]And I don't want to stream like 60 hours this week.
[533:45.34]We're like crossing like 50 something hours as of tomorrow.
[533:58.50]I really didn't plan on having, like, four 50-plus hour, like, no.
[534:07.27]I had it, but I lost it.
[534:24.08]People are working more than 60 hours a week?
[534:28.56]That's a lot of time.
[534:31.91]That's ten hours a day, six days a week.
[534:35.41]Holy shit.
[534:40.41]Seventy hours a week?
[534:47.33]Seventy?! !
[534:57.93]I was always at, like, 38.
[534:58.75]Like, 35 to, like, 40.
[535:02.43]70 fucking hours.
[535:04.77]Holy shit, man.
[535:06.59]That's a lot of time.
[535:21.08]I overshot it.
[535:21.70]Alright, 856.
[535:27.52]That's eight days a week.
[535:31.46]No, it depends on how many hours you work.
[535:33.15]If you work like 20 straight hours, it's like 12 straight hours.
[535:36.57]That's a lot of time.
[535:37.65]Eight days a week.
[535:44.44]Yeah, I got that nine hour a week schedule.
[535:57.98]I can't even see the wires.
[535:58.96]I don't even know which one I'm jumping to.
[536:16.35]Just hold Y. Yeah, I was.
[536:29.02]I'm really just trying to follow him, but that's distracting in its own way.
[536:32.58]I'm not going... How am I not going far enough?
[536:54.12]I'm waiting for the...
[537:16.75]I don't think it's a complete disaster yet.
[537:18.83]Fucking rail sucks.
[537:37.33]I have two minutes to do this.
[538:11.69]Here we go.
[538:18.42]How was I not turned all the way?
[538:19.92]What the fuck, man?
[538:30.55]Having like 60% rail is actually fucking ruining this whole thing.
[538:35.65]Not having the rail at 100% is actually ruining these runs.
[538:40.17]Without a doubt.
[538:42.36]I don't even know where he is.
[538:51.35]I need to level up like five more times.
[538:53.15]To be able to reliably probably do this.
[538:58.49]I'm up in front of you.
[539:03.62]Dude, why am I even...
[539:13.03]This is where I got to last time.
[539:14.21]He goes up and then he rides the... No!
[539:25.96]That's the farthest I've gone.
[539:27.04]It was right there.
[539:28.26]I was so close.
[539:29.08]I just didn't know what was next.
[539:32.94]Do it in one combo.
[539:33.65]Do it in one combo.
[539:35.35]Nope.
[539:39.29]That's the first time I've ever even seen that one.
[539:51.87]Should have just done the flush.
[539:54.59]I feel like I can do it now.
[539:56.73]Let's see.
[539:57.47]I'm supposed to stop right now.
[539:59.93]But... Why even give him fucking firebombs?
[540:04.27]This shit already sucks.
[540:06.33]Then you're gonna give... Why?
[540:18.98]He's the final boss.
[540:23.83]Don't let Eric win.
[540:27.08]Why can't I just push him off the fucking balcony?
[540:30.24]Why?
[540:30.52]I wasn't there.
[540:45.84]I tried to wait too.
[541:06.28]Jump on the other side of the bridge?
[541:08.86]I feel like transferring there is probably not a great idea.
[541:24.38]Okay, slow it down.
[541:30.97]What are you up to?
[541:34.05]What are you up to?
[541:48.72]What are you two boys up to?
[541:51.08]That's Adam Sandler doing his grandmother.
[542:05.99]Alright, I got plenty of time.
[542:15.98]Oh, you motherfucker.
[542:17.04]Are you kidding me?
[542:18.86]Where?
[542:26.51]Fuck.
[542:39.85]This sucks.
[542:44.09]Why?
[542:49.40]This sucks, asshole.
[542:53.66]This sucks.
[542:58.45]Jump higher.
[543:03.85]That's a good idea.
[543:12.64]When we get to that playground is where it gets all fucked up.
[543:17.54]Speaking of fucking up.
[543:20.54]How are you going to sleep tonight knowing Eric schooled you?
[543:24.26]I'm not going to the zoo.
[543:25.18]I'm not done.
[543:30.30]If you get to... I'm at like 38 out of 41.
[543:32.74]Like, I was going to throw in the towel.
[543:36.96]But I... You can't... I didn't think I was going to get past like 16.
[543:42.31]So I can't throw the towel in now because I saw the end of the game.
[543:47.27]Quick, gaslight him.
[543:49.64]You don't need to gaslight me.
[543:51.80]I'm already burning.
[544:01.71]This fire is hot.
[544:18.35]Why can I not do this?
[544:19.97]It's one of the things I can't fucking do.
[544:21.79]It's that stupid thing.
[544:24.62]It's like one of the only things I can't do that.
[544:26.90]Oh my god.
[544:35.13]Just go back.
[544:38.75]Go back.
[544:39.15]Alright, here we go.
[544:40.41]Playground bullshit.
[544:53.78]on the fucking power cord.
[544:55.04]Just get off.
[544:55.64]I have a new strategy.
[545:03.68]I don't give a shit.
[545:04.36]Just grab him.
[545:18.09]Oh, you stabbed me in the back.
[545:21.75]Why did you stab me in the fucking back?
[545:37.20]Dumb thing to do.
[545:41.05]And keep getting to that stupid part.
[545:43.11]And yes, I'm just going to jump.
[545:44.91]I'm going to get off the fucking thing.
[545:46.05]And I'm just going to grab him.
[545:47.65]Because I can't do it.
[545:50.84]I can do it while walking.
[545:53.76]Or I'm just going to say fuck it and just practice it.
[545:57.56]I've gotten so far.
[545:58.86]Like, what the hell, Eric?
[546:02.68]How did he drop you in the ocean?
[546:09.93]Hey, just stop sucking.
[546:11.81]Maybe we should do that too.
[546:18.79]What other phrases can I get out of you?
[546:28.58]This river sucks.
[546:33.32]Stop pretending.
[546:48.35]Stop stalling, idiot!
[547:00.93]Twitch chat.
[547:01.95]Comes with four phrases.
[547:04.33]And has a karate chop action.
[547:29.27]Alright, I have... If I don't do it now, I'm out.
[547:31.89]I'm not... I'm not on, like, more malding meltdown PlayStation fucking 2 stream.
[547:39.55]Who cares?
[547:40.33]Alright, here we go.
[547:51.02]This is it.
[548:01.65]Xbox.
[548:03.87]How dare you correct me?
[548:06.25]Did you just correct the streamer?
[548:09.94]Are you... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[548:13.94]That's got corrected?
[548:15.26]Okay.
[548:23.74]How did I miss that?
[548:25.06]I held Y the whole time?
[548:28.57]I held Y and I waited so long.
[548:33.70]It's ego.
[548:34.20]Wait, wait, wait, dude.
[548:37.34]You're saying it's on the Xbox?
[548:38.66]And make me look bad in front of fucking like 400 people?
[548:46.15]I can't.
[548:46.99]I don't get it.
[548:47.69]I don't understand.
[548:48.49]What the fuck did you... I'm holding Y when I jump to...
[549:05.73]This seems so finicky.
[549:09.46]Tap Y?
[549:10.78]I mean... That's what I... I was tapping Y before and then I got a bunch of people telling me that I should hold Y. Which one is it?
[549:27.91]Don't tap it.
[549:41.74]It's almost like I'm not getting enough air.
[549:45.92]What is my air even at?
[549:48.32]Doesn't it feel like I'm not getting enough air?
[549:49.78]Apparently, I don't know.
[550:01.43]Breathe.
[550:15.41]Come on.
[550:26.76]I thought I was too late before, now I'm too early.
[550:30.88]That's the worst jump of the whole entire run.
[550:32.97]The other ones I could probably get if I did them enough times.
[550:42.58]That was definitely too early, yeah.
[550:43.78]I figured maybe because the bridge goes up before it goes down.
[550:47.02]I figured maybe.
[550:48.72]Let's see.
[550:53.53]Plus I have to fucking be worried about the stupid triangle on the screen.
[550:59.41]Like that.
[551:16.74]Meltdown?
[551:17.30]No, I don't think so.
[551:19.38]I don't think so.
[551:25.39]I'm alright right now.
[551:29.45]Fucking... I'm fine.
[551:45.48]Hey, you don't, what does it say?
[551:46.34]You don't have to come over for career day anymore?
[551:49.26]Wait, what, why?
[551:52.16]Go to bed?
[551:52.74]I'm fine, don't worry.
[551:54.06]This is the end, too.
[551:58.65]And I'm not playing Xbox tomorrow.
[552:00.47]We're doing Diablo II tomorrow.
[552:05.43]So, it's a whole nother setup.
[552:07.47]So it's either now, or it's probably never.
[552:22.75]I didn't even mean to jump.
[552:23.75]I let go.
[552:24.71]My hands are sweaty.
[552:26.79]My hand let go of A. I didn't mean to jump.
[552:43.10]Let's go!
[552:44.00]Let's go!
[552:44.62]This is it!
[552:54.34]Going all night, boys and girls.
[552:58.04]We are not.
[553:03.52]Why did it just do that?
[553:07.84]Something is wrong.
[553:09.06]What am I doing wrong?
[553:10.98]Is it still too early?
[553:12.26]I can't even fucking tell, man.
[553:15.92]How far do I have to be on this stupid thing?
[553:29.14]He's supposed to have max stats to do this.
[553:36.25]Am I really just doing this for no reason because I don't have enough stats to do it?
[553:42.61]I mean, I've gotten pretty damn close.
[553:45.29]Yes.
[553:46.43]No.
[553:49.11]Why do I feel like people saying no want this to be a 12-hour stream?
[553:52.49]I think that's what's going on.
[554:13.36]I waited so long.
[554:14.41]If I wait any longer, I'm going to fall off the damn bridge.
[554:34.76]You need to jump more.
[554:37.86]Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[554:39.10]Just like jump.
[554:39.94]Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[554:43.80]He's going sideways.
[554:52.01]The absolute worst time to jump.
[555:02.43]Plus the guy going sideways.
[555:03.65]Is that?
[555:04.77]That's what you guys have been talking about.
[555:06.19]I was wondering what the fuck you guys are talking about.
[555:09.06]Admin, he's going sideways.
[555:12.48]That's what you guys are on about.
[555:13.84]Okay.
[555:25.25]I think I'm going crazy.
[555:29.93]How is it possible?
[555:41.47]I feel like you're missing.
[555:46.65]Fucking Tony Hawk.
[555:50.10]God damn it.
[555:52.18]Why do you have to keep me addicted here?
[555:54.60]On this fucking burn into muscle memory.
[555:58.95]This one stage.
[556:08.31]I haven't even done a royal flush in a while either.
[556:10.18]What a fucking mistake.
[556:41.06]Now we're getting... Alright.
[556:45.68]Now we're getting... We're getting to the... Yeah, you know the stage of video game madness?
[556:53.97]When you do the same thing so many times that it starts to become a dream.
[557:01.51]I'm having a dream about this game right now, this stage, right here.
[557:13.14]Your skills are depleting.
[557:17.36]Yes.
[557:21.57]Alright, I'm calling it.
[557:22.79]I'm calling it.
[557:23.45]That's it.
[557:24.15]I'm calling it.
[557:24.69]I've called it.
[557:25.37]Now I have to do it.
[557:26.03]I have to call it.
[557:26.91]I've called it.
[557:27.99]It's over.
[557:28.53]I've called it.
[557:29.59]It's over.
[557:29.93]That's it.
[557:30.75]That's enough.
[557:32.17]We'll be live tomorrow with Diablo II.
[557:34.45]Called it.
[557:36.29]I've called it.
[557:36.75]I can't sit here and do this anymore.
[557:39.67]This is burning a hole in my brain.
[557:46.53]I'm gonna go to the- oh here comes another doctor bit oh Jeremy you go to the doctor when something happens in the video game and you're getting like mad yeah you come to me every time I know let me go let me see if I can figure out what you're gonna say hmm you're going to say uh hey doc something's wrong and the doctor's gonna say oh did you play Tony Hawk 2 yes that was what I was about to do
[558:13.76]No, I don't want to do this anymore.
[558:19.49]If I don't actually get into the next like three attempts, I'm out.
[558:25.19]Maybe I'll try it again tomorrow.
[558:44.12]Clip that.
[558:45.72]Somebody clip it.
[558:46.93]And slow it down.
[558:47.81]For the frame.
[558:51.05]It's my stats.
[558:59.67]Like, I want a frame-by-frame analysis.
[559:03.31]I want to hire, like, an esports pro to do a frame-by-frame analysis of why I didn't jump higher at the end of that.
[559:10.60]Don't grind on the ledge.
[559:11.90]What do you want me to jump?
[559:14.06]Wait, walk it?
[559:24.20]I was lucky.
[559:25.06]I didn't even mean to get that.
[559:26.08]Do you see how fucking horrible that was?
[559:27.74]I did not even get that.
[559:29.38]I don't have enough stats.
[559:36.18]I want an esports pro to clip that one and tell me what happened with that!
[560:11.33]It's alright, I fell into it.
[560:12.81]I fell into it.
[560:13.37]Alright, does it get speed?
[560:27.76]Why did I go into a manual?
[560:29.08]The Xbox controller with the one big fucking button.
[560:32.58]One big ass button.
[560:55.06]Get it!
[560:55.80]Get up!
[560:56.22]It's okay!
[560:56.64]Your knee is going to be fine, honey!
[560:58.66]Your knee is going to be fine, honey!
[561:01.96]I'm still better than you!
[561:03.48]You got lucky, you little punk!
[561:05.26]Slam city jamming!
[561:06.17]You lucky little bitch!
[561:08.51]Get back here!
[561:09.79]You ain't nothing!
[561:11.09]I know I can kick your ass!
[561:12.81]I can't!
[561:13.91]I can't anymore.
[561:14.93]I can't.
[561:15.31]That was fucking terrible.
[561:17.35]That was... That was... Terrible.
[561:21.55]It was unbelievably awful.
[561:23.81]That was so bad.
[561:29.85]I don't even feel fulfilled.
[561:51.74]Frey Slaughtered.
[561:57.76]Dude, I almost turned the camera on.
[562:02.12]I almost turned the camera on and did a wink right at the end.
[562:04.06]Because I was like, fuck it, it's over and I'm just going to get a wink out.
[562:11.39]Oh my god, that was so painful.
[562:13.15]That wasn't even that big of a deal either.
[562:14.91]I'm so sorry, everybody.
[562:16.17]That was probably so painful.
[562:27.12]But yeah, look at that!
[562:29.22]Or should I say those?
[562:31.78]Time to kick in the toddy smooth, boy.
[562:35.15]How about that?
[562:36.17]Hey, you know, for a fat guy, I don't sweat that much.
[562:40.70]no no that's not true I sweat a lot strong that game is great what a fun game we'll go funny we'll go funny sure it's a needle but uh moves like a sewing machine oh that was a really fun game that's just as good as I remember breath check pits sweat stains minimal we got a ton of subs too go goiki gave 20 community subs hello ladies
[563:09.08]Nice legs.
[563:10.26]What time do they open?
[563:12.66]Okay, so somebody gave... I'm on the secret level.
[563:19.67]Wait.
[563:20.45]We got Iron Man?
[563:23.73]Marvel Iron Man and Marvel characters are... I'm not going to bed.
[563:30.35]Not yet.
[563:31.67]I'm not going to bed yet.
[563:32.41]I want to see Iron Man.
[563:33.47]I want to do the secret level of Iron Man.
[563:36.50]And Gene Simmons...
[563:49.41]God damn you, Tony Hawk.
[563:51.60]I want to address these bits here.
[563:53.90]SoupGG gave a thousand bits, but first of all, they said cheesesteakguy here.
[563:57.42]Okay, so cheesesteakguy, the guy that said he would beat Big Apple Challenge before 10,000.
[564:01.58]I'll throw off my cheesesteak on my keyboard.
[564:03.60]I didn't, by the way.
[564:05.10]I just want to say you're the worst Tony Hawk player I've ever seen.
[564:08.49]It's not even true.
[564:09.81]You give this controller to a baby, and they won't be able to get past level 1 inherently.
[564:13.83]That being said, this is probably my favorite stream you've ever done.
[564:16.05]Thank you, Jeremy.
[564:16.65]Love you.
[564:16.89]Thanks for playing my favorite game ever.
[564:22.19]Let's try that again.
[564:25.92]SoupGG says... SoupGG says, hey, cheesesteak guy here.
[564:32.24]If you don't know, somebody told me SoupGG said that if... I can't even do it again.
[564:41.68]SoupGG said that if I beat Tony Hawk Pro Skater Underground Big Apple Spot Challenge in four attempts, he would throw up a cheesesteak on his keyboard.
[564:52.00]I didn't, by the way, if you're just joining us.
[564:53.82]That didn't happen.
[564:54.42]They said, that being said, you're probably the worst Tony Hawk player I've ever seen.
[564:59.42]I said, that's not true.
[565:00.30]This is probably my favorite stream you've ever done.
[565:02.94]Thank you for playing my favorite game ever.
[565:06.74]I'm not the worst Tony Hawk player you've ever seen.
[565:10.03]If I was the worst Tony Hawk player you've ever seen, I wouldn't have beaten the game.
[565:14.15]I would have... Guys, worst Tony Hawk player ever means you can't even do a manual.
[565:19.37]You don't even know what it is.
[565:20.05]Like, you don't even know what a combo is.
[565:23.01]You just do a kickflip over a ledge.
[565:25.71]You don't even know...
[565:28.33]I think that you cannot be claimed as one of the worst Tony Hawk players ever if you get 100,000 points on a combo.
[565:35.46]You're just not.
[565:37.24]That's impossible.
[565:38.96]People just do a kickflip and get 100 points and they're done.
[565:47.44]You're the worst player to have beaten in the game.
[565:49.52]That's like so not even true.
[565:54.71]Even worse Tony Hawk player would beat Eric first try.
[565:57.41]That's not even true.
[565:59.40]That's not even true.
[565:59.98]That guy's gonna whip.
[566:03.26]Alright.
[566:03.86]That's dangerous, mate.
[566:04.88]That's not how you use a whip.
[566:07.60]You crack a whip.
[566:08.92]You don't swing a whip.
[566:14.43]It's just in the Neversoft office.
[566:16.13]These guys are doing this wrong.
[566:17.15]Someone's gonna get hurt.
[566:28.68]Funny story.
[566:30.59]For the carnival stream,
[566:33.14]Instead of Polypolite and Cuddles, we were in talks to have a different clown on that stream.
[566:43.35]And that clown was a kind of one of those, they call them, he said it was kind of like a freak show clown.
[566:50.11]He was going to bring a whip, and I was going to put a cigarette in my mouth, and he was going to whip a cigarette out of my mouth.
[566:57.99]And we were seconds away from signing this guy.
[567:01.33]But the reason why we didn't is in the 0.01% chance that he blows up my face.
[567:08.50]So we were like, no, we can't.
[567:10.78]That's not a good idea.
[567:24.81]That's a Family Guy joke.
[567:27.36]I mean, it's a sideshow act.
[567:30.31]So he was going to like, hey, I'm going to whip this thing out of your mouth.
[567:33.95]Because he's very accurate.
[567:40.09]That would have been legendary.
[567:41.29]But I can't.
[567:42.49]No, we talked about it extensively.
[567:44.01]The guy was a really nice guy, too.
[567:46.45]He's really interesting, really fun, smart person.
[567:59.56]Imagine if your childhood friends stole your jokes and got more Twitch subscribers than you.
[568:04.06]Would you let him win, or would you beat him in a clown-off?
[568:10.53]That was a bit message.
[568:11.31]I had to read it.
[568:13.65]Alright, that's somebody's fucking tooth.
[568:14.85]Alright, where's Iron Man?
[568:40.08]Oh my god.
[568:40.78]Are you serious?
[568:44.35]Edit tricks.
[568:46.17]What do you have?
[568:46.63]Special tricks.
[568:48.29]The scanner.
[568:49.29]The boot burst and fire blaster.
[568:56.55]Let's go to... Didn't we get a new level?
[568:59.97]We got Venice, right?
[569:05.01]Alright, here we go.
[569:06.65]Iron Man.
[569:09.75]Make Iron Man flush.
[569:19.29]Oh, that was sand.
[569:40.68]Here we go!
[570:21.62]His head rocked back.
[570:28.22]Okay, I need to... I have to leave.
[570:30.20]I have to leave.
[570:31.34]I actually have to leave.
[570:32.39]This is too much.
[570:35.49]I just want to try.
[570:46.17]Just go to Manhattan.
[570:47.90]He's going insane.
[570:49.08]Hotter than hell?
[570:49.94]Oh, fuck.
[570:50.28]Hold on.
[570:53.02]Watch this.
[570:53.64]I will watch the second ending, I promise.
[570:55.08]It's the last time you're gonna see it.
[571:03.31]We might as well get it out of our system now.
[571:06.59]Did I just get knocked down?
[571:08.05]Who pushed me over?
[571:08.83]Holy shit.
[571:14.34]This lady means business.
[571:37.50]Dude, that... That fucking Ryan manclip is gonna haunt me for, like, the next six hours.
[571:51.87]Otter than hell.
[571:58.75]Do his special.
[572:01.71]Big up for special.
[572:04.38]Down right, B. Left right, Y. Okay.
[572:11.73]We need to get special up.
[572:15.57]Oh, this is a kiss level.
[572:19.51]Why?
[572:19.81]It seems interesting.
[572:24.93]Turn the music on for this stage.
[572:26.47]I mean, I kind of have to, right?
[572:36.75]Let's go.
[572:46.68]Let's do down right B. Get the letters.
[573:04.85]Get the letters.
[573:08.18]No!
[573:23.39]That's 59,000!
[573:23.75]This is my favorite Kiss song.
[573:30.13]Give me that thing.
[573:33.07]Uh... Alright, that's it.
[573:35.34]Flush him.
[573:36.90]Fine.
[573:42.82]Alright, can I get a double flush to end it?
[573:44.29]Get the letters.
[573:46.45]Get the letters.
[573:47.31]Why?
[573:48.03]Let me get the letters.
[573:51.49]Okay.
[573:52.31]I got it.
[573:52.67]There's I. I got this S. Get the letters.
[573:59.60]You guys are so demanding.
[574:04.37]So commanding and demanding.
[574:06.21]I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
[574:14.23]I don't know where the other letters even are.
[574:20.69]Alright, if I don't get 100,000 points right now, I'm gonna give ten fucking... I'm gonna give ten... I'm gonna give ten french fries to Kim when we go to McDonald's next.
[574:45.08]Alright, here's K. Did I get it?
[574:49.70]K. I got it.
[574:54.54]K. K. S. Where's the other one?
[575:08.47]I'm blind.
[575:12.08]I got that.
[575:13.66]Oh, I thought that was just a glass panel.
[575:16.47]Look at the other panels underneath it.
[575:19.95]Okay.
[575:20.41]K, I, S. Where's the last S?
[575:33.02]In the ring.
[575:39.96]I'm gonna pierce my mind.
[575:42.43]I'm gonna pierce my mind.
[575:43.81]I'm gonna pierce my mind.
[575:52.61]Why can't I get up here?
[576:07.58]I'm gonna pierce my mind.
[576:10.08]I'm gonna pierce my mind.
[576:24.67]I mean, it looks like I... I just know people are going to be very upset about that.
[576:32.39]Alright, transfer.
[576:33.27]It's in a weird spot.
[576:35.65]Can I just grab it?
[576:40.30]Climb the damn thing.
[576:46.10]R to transfer.
[576:47.00]Let's do it.
[576:52.32]Just vert transfer.
[576:53.02]Yeah, I was doing vert.
[576:54.02]I was trying to do a vert transfer.
[576:57.81]Just like the... The half pipe is behind the... I'm not pressing R. Look at the... The half pipe is behind it.
[577:17.86]Can I just spine over this?
[577:18.86]No, just spine over that.
[577:20.64]Why would I try to do this?
[577:22.30]Alright, now I have to just jump through those.
[577:25.56]Dude, what?
[577:33.65]Oh, I can do it this way.
[577:34.57]Wait.
[577:48.81]Guys, you have to give me a little bit of a break here.
[577:52.89]It's been 10 hours of Tony Hawk, and I've peed two times.
[577:59.07]So, yeah, it's not going as clean as it could be.
[578:11.24]Congratulations, you unlocked the Kiss movie.
[578:21.07]Collective...
[578:57.61]Do it again.
[578:58.01]They put on a show for you.
[579:03.73]You're gonna get banned from Twitch?
[579:04.96]It's in the video game.
[579:07.12]I'm not gonna get banned from Twitch for a thing that's in the video game.
[579:10.10]Get out of the room.
[579:36.94]I have to get up here.
[579:38.22]Wait, that's me.
[579:38.84]That scared the shit out of me.
[579:46.33]I didn't even mean to do that.
[579:47.09]I just hit L. What the...
[580:04.54]Oh, no!
[580:05.28]Here comes the crazed Kiss fan!
[580:07.64]He wants to get on stage with Gene Simmons!
[580:10.24]He just wants a selfie!
[580:27.31]Why am I the only one falling down?
[580:32.51]Look, it's us.
[580:33.28]We did it.
[580:43.83]Okay, okay, it's funny, but it should... Okay, time to go to bed.
[581:02.12]Okay.
[581:02.32]That's it.
[581:13.03]Alternate ending.
[581:13.67]Okay, we'll do alternate ending right now.
[581:17.09]Oh my god.
[581:19.07]Alternate... That was Tony Hawk Underground, and it's a fucking fantastic game.
[581:22.79]I highly recommend it.
[581:23.51]If you have a 360, and there's a hard drive inside of it, get Tony Hawk's Underground.
[581:28.19]Tony Hawk's Underground 2 is behind me.
[581:32.30]It's right there.
[581:32.80]You can play that at some point too.
[581:41.16]That was a fucking really fun time.
[581:44.45]We stepped over the meltdown area.
[581:49.20]We just put our toe over it.
[581:50.34]It'll last like an hour and a half.
[581:55.74]We're good.
[582:00.65]Just enough to have an issue for a minute.
[582:06.66]It was a lot of fun, and seriously, these games are fucking incredible.
[582:09.99]I had an absolute blast.
[582:11.49]I'm so happy I got to experience this because I played all the main ones.
[582:16.01]Tony Hawk, Tony Hawk 2, Tony Hawk 3, Tony Hawk 4.
[582:19.18]I never really did this one.
[582:21.64]I played it like here and there randomly, but I never really played it.
[582:26.78]But let's do the alternate ending.
[582:28.18]This is what happens if what?
[582:29.45]What's the scenario here?
[582:35.34]But how does this end?
[582:36.90]What's the scenario?
[582:42.74]Why does this happen?
[582:49.83]Somebody link it right here.
[582:50.69]Okay.
[582:52.25]This is when he hooks underground alternate ending.
[582:58.93]Make sure I can hear
[583:03.90]Make sure you guys can hear too, because that's important.
[583:07.33]Alright, let's watch it.
[583:15.62]Here we go.
[583:16.22]This is the alternate ending to Tony Hawk Underground.
[583:19.76]Jeez, man.
[583:20.88]I think we broke the pinata with that video.
[583:23.76]We can't even keep up with orders.
[583:26.91]Oh, how cute.
[583:28.93]Two little skaters and their ghetto shop.
[583:31.91]Heard your video went over pretty good.
[583:33.99]I guess kids dig that goofy soul skating crap.
[583:37.45]I tell you what, I'll buy you out for half a mil right now.
[583:40.63]I got my checkbook.
[583:41.99]I told you, it was never about the money.
[583:46.13]Right, right, I forgot.
[583:47.71]Mr. Pure, I should have fixed you back in Tampa.
[583:50.83]Tell it to your posse.
[583:52.49]We're through.
[583:53.76]I've got everything I need.
[583:56.00]Not this.
[583:57.58]Remember?
[583:58.44]Hawaii, building jump, helicopter.
[584:01.35]That was some sick footage.
[584:03.01]Too bad no one ever saw it.
[584:05.23]You backstabbing mob flipping cockroach.
[584:08.89]Hey, what do you say?
[584:10.67]One last trip around the neighborhood.
[584:13.13]Winner takes the tape.
[584:28.09]I wanted to do that.
[584:31.82]That was... Remember I was saying, like, why can't I just push him over and get it?
[584:36.46]Why can't I throw him down and get it?
[584:38.40]Wow.
[584:43.05]How do you get this ending?
[584:54.69]You gotta get that C and you have to earn it.
[584:56.79]You beat the game a second time.
[584:58.45]Oh, so when you get through a second time, they're just like, yeah, you can just push them over.
[585:02.31]You don't have to do the hard line thing.
[585:06.03]That's funny.
[585:08.99]Alright, that's where we're gonna end it.
[585:09.99]I'll see you guys tomorrow for Diablo II Hardcore.
[585:12.73]It's been a while.
[585:13.27]It's been a week, a couple weeks actually, hasn't it?
[585:19.16]It's been like a week and a half.
[585:25.07]See if we can beat Diablo.
[585:29.39]I'm looking forward to it.
[585:30.41]See you tomorrow.
[585:33.93]Starting at the same time, so probably around 2 o'clock.
[585:37.83]Somewhere, yeah, 2-ish.
[585:39.30]2.
[585:40.62]Same time.
[585:43.36]But let's do the bits.
[585:44.70]Let's go back earlier.
[585:45.52]I gotta get this off my screen because it's covering up everything.
[585:49.52]Thanks for joining me.
[585:50.96]Thanks for joining us.
[585:54.23]Hope you had a good time.
[585:55.09]I did.
[585:57.83]We'll see you all tomorrow.
[585:59.03]Take care.
[585:59.45]Get some sleep.
[586:01.93]See you soon.
[586:05.16]But, let's do the bits.
[586:07.62]It's time for slime.
[586:08.56]Thanks for 500 bits.
[586:10.72]They say thug hype.
[586:14.84]This was one of those streams a lot of people were waiting for.
[586:16.77]It was a good one.
[586:21.00]Jay Onzel, thanks for the 300 bits.
[586:24.18]Hi Jerma, I was so hyped for the stream today because I love this game and I'm just imagining you as the Steve Buscemi skater meme.
[586:32.21]We had a wink too.
[586:32.89]That's a real wink.
[586:37.67]Alright, let's go.
[586:38.95]What was that image?
[586:48.94]Why was I like back here?
[587:01.19]look I how long have I been in darkness this room's not dark you want me to just want me to blow up your immersion right now
[587:34.35]The room's not dark.
[587:36.53]Holy shit, that's pretty bad here.
[587:39.81]The exposure was down low because I started the stream during the day.
[587:45.23]Sorry, guys.
[587:52.05]You look tired.
[587:54.04]Yeah, I am.
[588:01.64]Audio is... Yeah, audio is bad because of the...
[588:07.12]I wonder why.
[588:07.86]It's past my bedtime.
[588:12.70]No, I guess I gotta eat something.
[588:16.19]I gotta eat something.
[588:17.31]I ate before the stream, but a lot of you guys know I don't eat on stream.
[588:23.19]Not usually.
[588:23.89]I don't really like it.
[588:25.57]I did wink.
[588:26.09]Yes, I did when it was dark.
[588:27.47]Fine, you want to...
[588:36.80]BluePunda, thanks for the 300 bits.
[588:38.80]They say uncanny.
[588:40.02]Uncanny.
[588:41.40]Yes, it's online.
[588:42.34]300 bits.
[588:42.69]Never thought in my life I would hear a Quasimodo song on a Jerma stream.
[588:49.95]Yeah, sorry to all the VOD watchers.
[588:52.61]You probably won't be able to watch any of this stream.
[588:56.79]There's probably going to be chunks that are watchable.
[588:59.65]But...
[589:09.09]Start the video now.
[589:10.45]It hasn't taken on yet.
[589:12.59]Quick.
[589:13.35]Load it into cache on your browser.
[589:15.33]Quick.
[589:15.87]Do it.
[589:16.17]Yeah, because almost this whole stream is going to be gone.
[589:19.86]But this was a fun live only stream.
[589:24.38]Because there was just copyright music playing almost the entire game.
[589:29.53]Download it.
[589:31.95]Yeah, thanks.
[589:33.41]Atrolux, Atrox, thanks for the thousand bits.
[589:35.71]Ten dollars.
[589:36.97]Oh, there's nothing on the screen.
[589:42.09]Thank you, Azulux.
[589:43.29]Dropping this because this game is in my top five ever.
[589:45.50]Thanks for playing it, man.
[589:47.84]It is really, really, really good.
[589:54.08]I wish they would make more of these.
[589:57.28]Sorry.
[589:58.63]Something in the throat there.
[590:01.87]I wish they would make more of these.
[590:04.17]And not...
[590:05.94]iPad games.
[590:07.18]But I'm not sure if there's a market for it anymore.
[590:09.90]Let's talk sad truths here.
[590:12.88]I don't know if there's really a huge market for arcade skating games anymore.
[590:19.24]Everybody wants Skate 4.
[590:21.62]Skate 4.
[590:22.24]People request it every single year.
[590:26.24]But I don't know if they would... What?
[590:29.47]What's going on?
[590:31.33]Oh, God.
[590:32.67]Sorry.
[590:33.99]Um...
[590:35.48]I just don't know.
[590:36.50]There might not be a market for it anymore.
[590:45.49]It's just... It kind of fell out of popular culture.
[590:51.91]There's a lot of diehard fans of these games.
[590:55.01]For very good reason.
[590:56.68]And I would say I would be one of them.
[590:59.66]I never played Skate, though.
[591:02.12]I heard Skate 3 was good.
[591:03.16]I never played it.
[591:05.22]But I have played all the Tony Hawks.
[591:06.70]Pretty much.
[591:10.01]But people love it.
[591:14.65]People love these things.
[591:19.23]You did, didn't you?
[591:20.89]I did not play Skate 3.
[591:24.04]Skate 3?
[591:24.88]No.
[591:25.66]Tony Hawk 2.
[591:27.00]Maybe you're thinking of Tony Hawk 2.
[591:29.76]Yeah.
[591:30.96]That's definitely what you're thinking of.
[591:37.17]Yeah.
[591:37.89]Bulbaswag, thanks for the 999 bits.
[591:41.11]999.
[591:41.27]I've been on vacation, so I've missed the last few streams.
[591:44.31]They look like a blast, though.
[591:49.69]Yeah, I think Outer Wilds was fun and interesting.
[591:56.57]This stream was kind of crazy and all over the place.
[591:59.88]A lot of different streams this week.
[592:08.34]We're really going to chill out tomorrow.
[592:13.28]He did play it.
[592:14.06]I don't click links in my chat, sorry.
[592:19.36]We started, we watched like an action movie with Asura's Wrath.
[592:24.81]And then we did explore and do the puzzle game and figure out the Outer Wilds.
[592:32.17]And then we had a stream today which was
[592:36.64]I laughed like every five seconds on this stream.
[592:40.04]Then tomorrow we're just gonna dial it back and do a chill stream tomorrow.
[592:44.34]He liked an old Tony Hawk game better than Outer Wilds.
[592:47.60]That's not fair though.
[592:52.41]Do I have any interest in Warcraft 3 Reforged?
[592:55.97]No.
[592:56.99]Because I heard it sucks.
[593:05.25]I heard it's really not that much of a reforging and more of a repainting.
[593:22.12]So I don't know if I'm going to care that much about it.
[593:26.78]It also does not give me very much confidence in what Diablo 4 is going to look like.
[593:42.54]From my understanding, it's kind of... They stripped a bunch of stuff from it.
[593:48.48]The graphics really aren't that good.
[593:50.04]They didn't really remake very much.
[593:53.06]They kind of upped some textures and some models, right?
[594:06.05]Custom maps you don't own anymore.
[594:07.45]It belongs to Blizzard.
[594:08.83]But you know why they're doing that, right?
[594:11.11]You know why they're doing the custom games are ours?
[594:14.64]Because look what happened to Dota.
[594:19.00]Dota was created in one of their IPS.
[594:23.32]And it created one of the biggest video game genres on Earth.
[594:30.34]And they couldn't take it.
[594:31.94]They couldn't control it.
[594:36.50]So, in their minds, what they're probably thinking is, if another Dota comes up in these custom games, we will own it.
[594:55.59]No one's gonna make custom games now.
[594:59.05]I would probably jump on and mess around in tower defense.
[595:01.73]That was one of my favorite things to do.
[595:03.75]Tower defense, hero line wars.
[595:06.47]It was a lot of fun.
[595:08.21]But, yeah, you kind of take away the incentive to... Hey, make a game mode for us.
[595:15.33]Make a new, fun, custom game.
[595:17.73]But, if anyone ever thinks it's good, you can't have it.
[595:23.08]It's ours.
[595:26.40]You're ours now.
[595:27.74]Yeah.
[595:29.98]Custom game golden age is long over.
[595:31.68]People just download Unity and Unreal.
[595:33.91]They actually have the chance to make money.
[595:35.47]That's also another really good point.
[595:37.15]That's a good point.
[595:37.79]That's a great point, actually.
[595:38.93]That you can just make your own game now.
[595:43.22]There's a lot of tools now that were sort of out of reach some 15, 20 years ago.
[596:00.03]Have I played Beautiful Joe?
[596:01.21]I have.
[596:01.77]They are amazing games.
[596:03.83]Both of them.
[596:05.73]Some of the best GameCube and PS2 games.
[596:09.72]Love them.
[596:10.82]And they are behind me.
[596:12.24]They're in two cases behind me.
[596:13.64]We're going to play them very soon.
[596:21.52]But let's keep going before it gets too late.
[596:27.03]But thank you.
[596:27.59]That was Bulbaswag.
[596:28.45]Thank you for the $9.99.
[596:31.37]Rasnama.
[596:32.55]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[596:33.43]First stream I've been able to catch.
[596:34.71]Busy with college and life.
[596:35.73]I've been watching your stuff on YouTube for a while.
[596:37.81]Glad I can actually catch a stream for even a small while.
[596:41.04]Appreciate you, Jerm.
[596:43.98]Glad to have you.
[596:47.44]Thanks for stopping by and thanks for $5.
[596:52.79]One Trick Gaming, thanks for the five community subs.
[596:55.91]Enyaz, thanks for the five dollars, 500 bits.
[597:00.50]Jerma, I'm a recent fan since about October.
[597:03.90]Cool, welcome.
[597:05.46]I'm giving you bits tonight as your Dreamcast video that just went up was the only thing keeping me from falling into shock as I just discovered a family member took their life this morning.
[597:13.91]That's horrible.
[597:14.87]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[597:20.07]I am so sorry to hear that.
[597:23.73]I'm in the UK studying abroad in university.
[597:26.05]I'm away from my family who live in the west of Ireland.
[597:29.96]And your voice is keeping me calm.
[597:31.50]So I needed to say thanks and keep doing you.
[597:36.50]And as you're about to go through, and you currently are going through, a very, very, very, very difficult time.
[597:45.08]Stay strong.
[597:47.96]That's a really terrible thing to happen.
[597:54.19]Seek guidance if you need to.
[597:58.03]Grieve.
[598:03.22]Keep your head on your shoulders.
[598:05.32]That's tough.
[598:08.72]Thank you so much for the 500 bits.
[598:11.86]I wish you and your family the best.
[598:20.09]Thank you again.
[598:30.01]We had five community subs from Frliddy.
[598:37.10]Thank you, Frliddy.
[598:39.16]And just to touch on that one more time about something.
[598:43.30]I've been fairly fortunate in my life to not have somebody potentially close to me pass away suddenly.
[598:54.97]I can't imagine the pain that people could be feeling when that happens.
[599:09.12]We joke around a lot, and we fuck around a lot.
[599:15.87]On this stream.
[599:19.87]Stuff like that, I'm just really, really, really sorry.
[599:24.38]I cannot even imagine.
[599:25.32]Because I think about my life, right?
[599:28.34]You think about what you and people that you know, that you've maybe seen or done things with or grown up with, or...
[599:37.19]I think that's why a lot of people can heal.
[599:41.80]Because you put yourself in that scenario.
[599:47.76]Somebody said, life's unpredictable, be safe.
[599:54.03]Just do your best.
[599:55.43]Do the best you can.
[599:57.57]That's all you can do.
[600:01.83]I just wanted to kind of do a... say something else about that.
[600:06.51]That's not fun.
[600:09.05]That's tough stuff.
[600:12.37]The best you can is good enough.
[600:13.75]That's true.
[600:16.22]Just do the best you can.
[600:22.44]But SquimPST gave 400 bits.
[600:26.02]I've been wheel-throwing this whole stream, and all I can think about is Bugleberry Pottery ASMR, so thank you for that.
[600:35.41]Nice.
[600:36.33]You got a wheel?
[600:40.32]I imagine that would be really, really relaxing just to throw on like a TV show or a YouTube video or stream and just throw a wheel throw.
[600:48.99]You can just sit there for hours doing it.
[600:54.15]Your viewers just plummeted to zero.
[600:55.85]Bugleberry mentioned.
[601:00.66]Autumn Dragons, thanks for the $2.50.
[601:02.20]Why haven't you made a beatboxing album or something?
[601:04.88]You have the talent, and I'm genuinely curious why you haven't capitalized on it yet.
[601:11.75]It's kind of just like a neat little trick.
[601:15.25]You know what I mean?
[601:16.93]I know that I can do it, but I can't do it as well as a lot of people that are very, very good at it.
[601:24.10]So it's almost just like a neat little thing that I can just turn on sometimes.
[601:31.50]You look at some professional beatboxers, they run circles around the stuff that I'm doing.
[601:38.23]So capitalize on an album.
[601:40.99]I don't, I'm not sure.
[601:41.84]It's kind of just like a hobby thing.
[601:43.68]I just do it sometimes.
[601:44.78]I'll be in the shower just doing it.
[601:54.65]Well, I appreciate the fact that you think that it's good enough to do that.
[601:59.12]He is the first beatboxing gamer.
[602:00.96]There are probably others.
[602:03.60]Urbungo, thanks for the 300 bits.
[602:06.64]Halulu, thanks for the 300 bits.
[602:08.86]Jeremy, you've been a huge inspiration in getting me to open up to people more and start streaming and making videos.
[602:13.74]I was initially a little... It was a little tough hearing my own voice in recordings, but I'm gradually getting used to it.
[602:18.70]If you have any tips for a newcomer, I'd appreciate them.
[602:21.57]Thanks for being you.
[602:24.86]um something I learned a long time ago is do do what you want to do it can get really really tricky and you can kind of get in your own way when you start to think about instead of what you would want to do what would somebody else want to do
[602:50.19]Try not to compare yourself to other people.
[602:52.23]That's also tough, too, because you're like, oh, this person and me and this person do this.
[602:56.49]And how many people watch?
[602:57.83]And how many people sub to that person?
[603:00.69]How many viewers do they have on YouTube?
[603:02.99]Their videos are better than mine.
[603:04.11]No, they're not.
[603:05.19]I've got to try to make a better video than them.
[603:07.67]You can get lost.
[603:09.91]Do you.
[603:10.93]Do what you want to do.
[603:12.69]And stock up on baby food.
[603:15.93]The last part is not a joke.
[603:26.58]We had $30.
[603:27.46]Yeah, 3,000 bits from Goiki.
[603:37.94]$30.
[603:37.98]It's a lot of money.
[603:38.53]They say skate or die.
[603:41.15]Skate or die.
[603:42.73]Thanks for the huge amount of money.
[603:43.69]That's $30.
[603:43.95]Is that a college tip?
[603:48.19]No, it's a streamer tip.
[603:49.15]That's a real streamer tip.
[603:51.66]Alright, so it's been 10 hours.
[603:53.24]Hear me out on this.
[603:53.86]This is very important.
[603:55.34]It's been 10 hours of this stream being turned on.
[604:00.20]Right?
[604:02.10]I've gotten up from the chair a couple times.
[604:04.36]I've peed.
[604:04.90]But I'm back here in about, in what, 2 minutes?
[604:07.00]3 minutes?
[604:07.74]Each time?
[604:09.78]10 hours and like 5 minutes of time not on camera?
[604:14.30]Or not on broadcast?
[604:18.46]I mean, you gotta eat something, you gotta drink something, you gotta have something available.
[604:21.98]I mean, we've been here for 10 hours.
[604:24.75]Baby food.
[604:27.35]Those little baby food packets.
[604:29.31]Or even the little jars.
[604:30.71]You can eat those in five seconds.
[604:33.59]You know how easy it is to drink just to slurp down one of those baby food packets?
[604:38.17]It's got vitamins, it's got fruits, it's real shit.
[604:41.49]It's food.
[604:42.71]It's just liquefied.
[604:46.88]It's bananas, apples... He's not... I'm not Joe?
[604:54.29]No.
[604:56.05]Stay here.
[604:57.16]Nobody...
[606:01.43]So let me fix this.
[606:21.42]Okay.
[606:23.50]So those of you that said this was not real, it is.
[606:29.56]It's very real.
[606:31.36]It... This is... Apple, banana... This is real.
[606:35.72]Apple, banana, fruit on the go.
[606:38.02]All natural, no spoon.
[606:39.52]You just twist the shit off.
[606:44.55]Apple, banana, fruit on the go.
[606:46.83]This is designed for small children.
[606:48.75]Look at how small this is.
[606:55.96]You give these pouches to kids.
[607:00.15]It's baby food.
[607:01.08]It's not baby food.
[607:03.56]I mean... Who eats... Who's gonna eat this?
[607:09.32]Besides a baby.
[607:11.22]Who do you know that's going to eat this besides a baby or a toddler?
[607:16.11]Me.
[607:19.01]Look at how simple this is.
[607:45.57]Done.
[607:48.21]I just ate a full meal.
[607:50.32]In thirty sec- in twelve seconds.
[607:56.34]Done.
[608:01.78]I can keep going.
[608:04.88]A full baby meal.
[608:06.30]Yeah, but a full baby meal is still a full meal for somebody!
[608:10.03]It's a fu- a baby- a full baby meal can keep you going for another couple hours on livestream!
[608:17.47]Or beef jerky.
[608:22.03]I'm not crazy.
[608:23.37]Everybody else is.
[608:30.01]Really good.
[608:30.35]And they're fucking so fast.
[608:31.37]It's easy.

[610:01.04]The number one ingredient is apples and bananas.
[610:04.32]It's applesauce in a little jar.
[610:07.36]It's not a big deal.
[610:08.46]It's literally 70 calories.
[610:13.74]Yeah.
[610:16.67]But 70 fucking calories of super ultra hyper energy.
[610:21.03]Alright, I'm done.
[610:22.57]Can't believe nobody wants to hear my fucking tip.
[610:25.23]I've been doing this for 10 years.
[610:28.01]You don't think I figured some secrets?
[610:31.49]Some secrets seem strange.
[610:32.75]I've been doing this for a decade.
[610:36.31]I think I've learned a few secrets.
[610:44.47]These are fucking good.
[610:47.95]They're so good.
[610:48.65]Thank you.
[610:49.05]I'm so glad that there's a human in here that can back me up a little.
[611:03.42]It's a human detected.
[611:07.13]I like these things.
[611:08.49]They're really easy.
[611:09.95]And it's like a hundred calories.
[611:11.95]And then you drink like a glass of fucking almond milk.
[611:14.61]And you've had like 200... It's just a snack.
[611:16.99]It's not... Guys, I'm not talking about like eating a full plate of spaghetti.
[611:21.93]I'm talking about just a little something to like... Oh, I need something.
[611:25.01]A little something.
[611:27.75]Alright, let's finish the bitch.
[611:31.08]I said full- It's a full meal for a fucking child.
[611:33.10]Okay?
[611:34.08]It's a full meal for a child.
[611:35.08]It is.
[611:35.90]It's not- Alright, whatever.
[611:36.72]I lied.
[611:37.08]I got it wrong.
[611:38.14]It's a full meal for you.
[611:50.63]You lied.
[611:51.41]Stop lying, you-
[611:56.47]It's perfect for me.
[611:57.61]It just is.
[611:58.21]Alright, we're gonna move on from this.
[611:59.93]You give some secrets.
[612:01.93]You know, I gotta start holding on to my secrets.
[612:04.81]I can't tell everybody my secrets now.
[612:06.48]Because then they'll... I mean, I gotta... These are my secrets.
[612:08.90]What do you think I do when I go downstairs?
[612:10.96]I go... Drink a glass of water.
[612:14.44]And I shake around a little.
[612:15.82]I, like, shake my body.
[612:17.66]I move my back up and down.
[612:18.80]I do some stretches for my costochondritis.
[612:20.50]And I come back upstairs.
[612:25.54]Call me weird, that's fine.
[612:28.87]It's been 10 hours.
[612:30.41]And I'm good.
[612:31.17]I'm a little tired, a little cranky.
[612:33.79]I'm good.
[612:34.89]Maybe needed a little nap.
[612:36.33]Might need a bubble later, but I'm good.
[612:39.27]Hey, Apple Shift, thanks for $2.50.
[612:40.17]Appreciate it.
[612:45.99]Yo, have you heard the new Gorillaz song?
[612:47.47]I have not.
[612:48.78]Something I will do immediately when turning this off.
[612:54.85]It slaps.
[612:55.67]I'll have to hear it.
[612:58.24]DarkSoul, thanks for the 250.
[613:00.10]GapGaming here to let you know this is a fake funny ad.
[613:02.92]Just to let everybody know this is not real.
[613:05.12]GapGaming here to let you gappers know we think this stream is pretty rad.
[613:08.84]That's why we're gonna step it up and donate these 250 bits so we can scoop some totally epic gear from our store.
[613:15.48]Oh, I got some baby burps coming.
[613:18.00]Use code BANTHEMAN for 20% off your next order of knee pads.
[613:25.36]What?
[613:26.26]What did somebody say?
[613:27.96]Somebody said something funny in here.
[613:29.44]What did they say?
[613:33.86]I've seen people tagging somebody.
[613:35.08]They said something funny.
[613:35.82]What did they say?
[613:36.48]That was heavy info to drop on us.
[613:46.46]A baby thing?
[613:49.68]Holy shit, 20 pouches is only $10.
[613:54.39]Somebody's figuring this out in real time, and I'm so glad that they are.
[614:01.84]Somebody is figuring this all out, and I'm just so happy.
[614:05.16]You know when you just know you're right, and you have a secret, and you just know what you're saying is correct, and nobody believes you?
[614:19.40]That's not a good value.
[614:21.06]A jar of applesauce is like $3.
[614:22.12]This is not a jar of applesauce.
[614:24.22]This is apples, bananas, and lemon juice.
[614:28.20]It gives you a little kick.
[614:29.18]You don't have that in regular applesauce.
[614:43.15]What about granola bars?
[614:43.97]Those are great, too.
[614:47.06]You just pick the thing that you like.
[614:48.22]And I like go-go squeezers.
[614:49.94]Apple, banana, fucking lemon juice.
[614:52.08]A little kick.
[614:53.38]Squeezers!
[614:56.56]Uh, The Glare, thanks for 10 community subs.
[614:58.83]Appreciate it.
[615:02.27]Thank you, Fel6, for the 5 community subs.
[615:03.93]Appreciate it.
[615:07.89]Both of you.
[615:08.75]Back to back there.
[615:11.77]Oops, thanks for 500 bits.
[615:12.93]For the record.
[615:13.55]Somebody said, for the record.
[615:16.63]Angela Anaconda.
[615:29.92]Um... Holy shit.
[615:33.67]Yeah, this is like... What network was this show on?
[615:47.71]Is it on Nickelodeon?
[615:50.33]I distinctly remember seeing this show.
[615:52.07]This show was weird.
[615:59.61]Yeah, it was weird picture, real-life picture, stop-motion kind of animation stuff, right?
[616:04.95]They just used real photos of people and animated them.
[616:08.86]Yeah, it was a weird show.
[616:13.34]Yeah.
[616:17.40]Thank you, Hoops.
[616:18.72]Drink a better beer.
[616:47.69]You guys are gonna fucking kill me.
[616:49.27]I'm gonna... I have, like, my boomer brace on.
[616:57.32]Hi, Lord.
[617:04.91]Hi, reward.
[617:05.57]Thanks for the 250.
[617:05.93]Hey, Jerma.
[617:06.81]I was the guy who joked about you snapping on stream.
[617:11.99]It was intended all in good fun because chat loves to antagonize and cyberbully you.
[617:16.66]It was meant to be nothing more than a throwaway goof you happen to notice.
[617:19.58]That said, I'm still sifting through some old streams.
[617:22.19]What were you s- I'm the guy who joked about you snapping on stream.
[617:38.19]Yeah, and then I was like, yeah, why is that?
[617:40.27]I said, and what do you think that is?
[617:41.77]I remember that.
[617:44.49]I think it's fingers.
[617:52.70]Uh-oh, he's gonna fucking snap.
[617:59.18]You are fussy.
[618:06.50]That was fun.
[618:08.32]I especially like the part where I couldn't get over the wall.
[618:13.66]When I couldn't get over the wall, everybody was screaming mean things at me.
[618:20.97]Everyone get down, he's about to snap.
[618:28.20]Baker.
[618:30.88]We always do that.
[618:34.45]I know.
[618:35.23]I just give it back.
[618:38.04]I can't jab back.
[618:41.70]I jab back.
[618:43.26]I jab back.
[618:45.00]2020 Jerma jabs back.
[618:47.80]I have to be careful.
[618:53.35]Hey, 101 dominations.
[618:54.75]Thanks for 250.
[618:58.08]Jerma, with all the money coming in, if we don't see Danny DeVito in one of your streams, we're going to explode.
[619:02.89]Jokes aside, love your streams.
[619:04.31]Keep it up.
[619:07.51]I... I don't know if that'll happen, but it'd be really funny if it did.
[619:14.10]Is Jerma Merc the worst emote?
[619:15.64]No, jermaTV is.
[619:16.98]Or Jerma Bald.
[619:18.24]The Bald coin one.
[619:21.00]Keith King Crimson, your skater looks like Angela Anaconda.
[619:25.47]Thanks for the $2.50.
[619:26.25]Yeah, that is pretty accurate.
[619:30.70]Silent Serenity, thanks for 250, Silent Serenity.
[619:32.74]Imagine if your childhood friend stole your jokes.
[619:34.50]We got this one already, but it's funny.
[619:36.57]Imagine if your childhood friend stole your jokes and got more Twitch subs than you.
[619:40.29]Would you let him win?
[619:44.05]It would be really hard to beat that person in a clown-off, because no matter what, that person's audience would always see me as the pretender.
[619:53.15]It would just never work.
[620:04.05]I could give documented evidence.
[620:06.37]And it'd be like, yeah, I know, but... I'm already subbed to this guy.
[620:12.07]So... And I like him.
[620:15.31]I don't like you.
[620:16.90]I don't even know who the fuck you are.
[620:19.82]But I'm the funny one.
[620:20.70]I'm the funny guy.
[620:22.00]Yeah, but are you, though?
[620:24.66]I like him.
[620:26.10]I've been watching him for five years.
[620:28.98]He's gonna come in here and... Blow up this whole community like this?
[620:32.91]Nah...
[620:35.00]Maybe I'll give you a follow.
[620:36.71]Okay.
[620:41.79]Jeremiah sure does seem to know how this would all play out.
[620:45.97]That's just human nature, isn't it?
[620:47.49]Remember Carlos Mencia stole everybody's jokes and he was one of the most popular comedians ever?
[621:00.12]Nobody cared.
[621:10.67]God, he existed.
[621:16.39]He immediately became less popular.
[621:18.23]I don't know if it was immediate.
[621:20.99]I think that took a long... That took a while.
[621:22.95]That took a lot longer than I think you remember.
[621:29.35]He still had a bunch of... He still had his TV show.
[621:31.61]He was still touring.
[621:35.71]Joe Rogan made him disappear.
[621:48.18]Alright, how many seasons of Mind of Mencia were there?
[621:58.35]Mind of Mencia.
[622:02.91]There were four seasons of this show.
[622:07.94]Now, he wasn't around for like a year.
[622:09.36]He was around for like five plus years.
[622:13.22]Before anybody really, really took it to him to give it, like, oh, you were a joke stealer.
[622:23.05]But, you know.
[622:28.47]Fridalschlintz, thanks for the 250.
[622:30.05]Please turn the light on in your room.
[622:31.27]You'll ruin your eyes staring at a bright screen in the dark.
[622:34.49]I am in a bright room.
[622:45.75]Goiki gave 20 community subs.
[622:49.83]We caught it, but that's a lot of subs.
[622:51.28]Thank you, Goiki.
[622:55.10]Really appreciate that.
[623:03.27]You came out as a baby on this stream.
[623:04.81]Say goodbye to any future sponsorships unless it's from Gerber's Baby Food.
[623:09.03]Have you ever seen a sponsorship on this stream that wasn't a joke?
[623:12.19]Of us pretending there was one?
[623:16.25]Has this stream ever been sponsored once by anything that we're not making a pretend I'm sponsored joke?
[623:23.23]I don't think that's going to be an issue for me.
[623:26.32]I think I'll be okay.
[623:32.55]But that being said... Go, go, squeezers.
[623:37.71]They are the best.
[623:39.59]So is JetBlue.
[623:40.09]You should fly it every time you fly on an airplane.
[623:45.68]Ridge wallets are good.
[623:47.58]I like it.
[623:50.04]Out of those three... I mean, if any of you are listening... I'm here...
[623:56.48]I like to talk.
[623:58.10]I like to meme my chat.
[623:59.04]We go back, we jab back and forth.
[624:00.52]We have like this little fun banter thing going on.
[624:06.05]They call me short and I like scream at them.
[624:09.15]It's fun.
[624:17.11]I eat baby food in front of them and they call me a weirdo.
[624:24.77]Don't you want to sponsor this stream?
[624:26.25]Don't you want to, like, give a bunch of money to this stream?
[624:29.04]Why wouldn't you?
[624:29.70]Most of us are babies, too.
[624:39.74]Nah, I'm just fucking around.
[624:42.25]I'm just messing around, don't worry.
[624:43.55]Uh, I...
[624:48.35]Isaac?
[624:49.48]Isaac, thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[624:52.06]That stupid fart special made me laugh harder than anything else in a long time.
[624:55.54]Thanks for the fun stream.
[624:56.42]Thanks for watching.
[624:59.20]Thanks for spending time here.
[625:00.70]Thanks for giving me a very large amount of money.
[625:05.53]Glad you got some laughs.
[625:06.37]Thank you.
[625:08.63]Kip, thanks for the five community subs, Kip.
[625:12.83]Lazy Purple?
[625:13.65]What's going on, Lazy Purple?
[625:14.69]Lazy Purple, you're still here?
[625:16.14]It's late.
[625:17.80]last second bits because that was honestly the funniest dream I ever caught thank you Jerm I appreciate that you pushed through and beat it thanks a lot dude but you are still here here I should probably do this because oh yeah that makes you I mean you got a vip let's go newest vip lazy purple
[625:50.64]Bane?
[625:51.24]What do you mean?
[625:56.15]Lazy Purple is an old YouTuber.
[625:58.95]Made a lot of TF2 content.
[626:00.87]Funny guy.
[626:01.87]Funny guy.
[626:09.63]Well, I use the term old because we're talking like 6, 7, 8 years ago.
[626:20.80]He still does.
[626:21.74]Yeah, I know.
[626:23.28]I'm just saying, like, he's an old YouTube, like... He didn't start his YouTube channel three days ago.
[626:28.50]He's been around for a long time.
[626:29.52]Like, he's an old YouTuber.
[626:31.82]He's an old TF2 YouTuber.
[626:33.71]That's accurate.
[626:40.13]What did you... LazyPurple was making videos, I think, before I was.
[626:43.95]Like, in 2010 or something.
[626:45.29]When did you start your channel?
[626:47.07]2011?
[626:48.21]2012? 2012?
[626:54.13]Something like that?
[626:56.39]That's a good question.
[627:00.99]Oh, yeah.
[627:02.99]You really are a baby.
[627:06.20]July 21st, 2010.
[627:07.60]That's a year before I started YouTube.
[627:13.84]So, yeah.
[627:15.00]You've been around a long time.
[627:19.76]Thanks for watching.
[627:21.39]Glad to have you.
[627:23.65]Five community subs from ChefSCT.
[627:26.37]Thanks for the five subs.
[627:27.55]Aw, Futz, thanks for the $11.
[627:29.17]1100 bits.
[627:32.89]Hi, Germans.
[627:33.27]I want to say thanks for everything.
[627:34.15]The past year has been one of the hardest years of my life.
[627:37.19]And the main thing keeping me afloat and positive are your streams and the chat.
[627:40.28]Hi, chat.
[627:41.96]Thank you so much for everything and a fantastic stream tonight.
[627:44.08]Have a great rest of your night.
[627:45.98]You as well.
[627:48.48]We got a fun group of people here.
[627:53.99]This community is one of the best.
[627:55.19]At its very core, there's a lot of really, really, really great people here.
[628:09.69]I mean, the channel has grown so much in the last two years.
[628:14.25]I'm surprised it still can stay kind of like this.
[628:21.03]Once a channel typically, I mean, we've seen kind of the growth of a bunch of new people that are coming in that just the chat goes much faster.
[628:31.28]It's harder to pay attention to what people are saying.
[628:33.84]I mean, there's typically, nowadays, there's 4,000 to 6,000 concurrent viewers on this stream.
[628:44.73]Even a year or two ago, there was like 2,000, maybe.
[628:48.85]Two years ago, this stream was at like 1,800 to like 2,500 concurrent.
[628:56.09]We've grown like three times the audience in a year and a half.
[629:02.36]But even still, it still is... It's still fun.
[629:09.78]It's not getting corrupted.
[629:11.72]Not that it would, for really any reason, but...
[629:20.15]He's viewbotting.
[629:26.38]Why would I ever do that?
[629:33.34]We've had some growing pains on this channel.
[629:36.01]Nothing major, but anytime any channel grows this quickly, even for me, I'm trying to find ways to moderate the channel better.
[629:48.96]figure out how to have a community this large and what to do how what to how to be fair and we've seen like the bit minimum increase right like that's something I didn't really want to do but I did all this stuff is kind of only happened within the last two years but I still love it I'm still having a great time I'm glad there's uh people here that enjoy it too
[630:21.64]I worry about the implications behind gifted subs.
[630:24.18]What do you mean?
[630:26.50]Implications behind gifted subs.
[630:30.36]Like, people... There's a lot of gifted subs and they... What do you mean?
[630:40.73]Trolls become subs.
[630:45.89]Yeah, but that's... Most people that are coming here, they're just fucking around.
[630:49.51]They're not...
[630:53.07]I don't think I've, maybe a few times in five years on Twitch, have I really thought that there was a problem in the chat, like a real one.
[631:03.12]Not something that could be, you know, fixed with a spam filter or...
[631:08.93]I don't think, it's been a while since I think that there's been a real, I've had like, let me just put it this way.
[631:15.37]I'm not sure there's been a point where I've had a real problem with something going on in chat.
[631:20.46]Like a real problem with somebody or, I don't, that just doesn't really happen that often here.
[631:38.67]What were the problems?
[631:41.01]Um... I mean, we... Sometimes the channel... Sometimes it can get a little out of control with... Somebody will come in and say something... Really, really fucked up.
[631:53.99]Whether it's something just ridiculously... Just offensive, racist shit.
[631:59.50]Somebody will just drop a bunch of terrible shit.
[632:01.54]And it's like, okay, we gotta deal with this.
[632:04.88]Um...
[632:06.47]Sometimes the spam can get a little out of control.
[632:12.28]But that's not that big of a deal because it's easily correctable.
[632:24.41]But this community, you guys all think usually the same things are interesting.
[632:32.28]Or funny.
[632:33.74]Or... There's not a whole lot of split up groups of people in this community that don't like each other.
[632:40.63]Or don't agree with each other.
[632:41.55]You know what I mean?
[632:43.05]There's not that many people.
[632:46.57]Well, the Druid crew is less than 100 people.
[632:57.13]I should do a poll one day.
[633:00.17]He still thinks that.
[633:02.58]Don't you see the long game I'm playing here, guys?
[633:05.98]Come on.
[633:08.24]This is some serious 6,000 go-go squeeze brain IQ long play.
[633:20.14]This is the long con.
[633:22.78]Because the more... The more that we talk about... Oh, there's not that many people in the Drew crew?
[633:29.46]No, of course not.
[633:31.84]No, there's like 10 people in it.
[633:34.12]They get members.
[633:34.85]And then they get members.
[633:37.65]And then I can stream Nancy Drew whenever I want.
[633:41.63]Because all of you will be in the Drew crew.
[633:46.69]And I can stream the 250 game catalog.
[633:50.54]And everyone will be for it.
[633:59.60]Oh no, not my master plan.
[634:06.92]I'm not even sure there is that many Nancy Drew games.
[634:08.88]You're a megalomaniac.
[634:10.28]You psycho.
[634:10.96]You monster.
[634:13.92]No, I love the Drew crew.
[634:15.64]Their enthusiasm is encouraging.
[634:19.60]Makes me happy.
[634:20.20]It really does.
[634:25.60]You play this like a fiddle.
[634:32.65]We love you.
[634:33.55]We love you.
[634:34.21]Watching you play Diablo was the thing.
[634:35.71]It's my favorite.
[634:37.43]Outer Wilds was the second.
[634:38.53]I mean, we're playing Diablo II tomorrow.
[634:40.91]Get ready.
[634:41.81]Tomorrow's stream, by the way, is going to be very, very laid back.
[634:47.61]We're just going to... I say that, but I'm probably going to be really tense trying to fight Diablo.
[634:54.29]Ah, another battery fell.
[634:55.33]Why am I covering batteries?
[634:56.63]Yeah, it's going to be just chill tomorrow.
[635:01.14]If I beat Diablo and... Or if I die... Let's say I die at some point during that stream.
[635:09.78]I'm going to try not to, but it's pretty possible.
[635:11.50]Especially Act 5 is going to be hard.
[635:14.07]We'll just do a Sir's Wrath DLC.
[635:17.21]Like, if the D2 segment... If I cannot beat Act 5... Then, you know, after two or three hours have gone by, we'll just do a Sir's Wrath DLC.
[635:31.02]We'll see.
[635:33.00]Let's get the credits rolling.
[635:35.36]Roll those credits.
[635:38.50]Thanks for sticking around, guys.
[635:39.52]Thanks for another long one.
[635:44.61]Ten and a half.
[635:45.13]Ten and a half.
[635:46.17]Ten and a half.
[635:46.63]Ten and a half.
[635:47.07]Something like that.
[635:54.95]Almost eleven, almost.
[635:58.54]We were talking about that earlier.
[636:00.24]About how something goes say in like 60, 70 hour weeks.
[636:06.81]That's so tough.
[636:08.29]That's so much time.
[636:10.83]I really hope you're either making good money or you're making progress, you know?
[636:13.45]Here come the credits.
[636:23.72]70 hours.
[636:24.94]That's... You're talking about, like, what?
[636:26.48]5 12-hour days or something?
[636:28.54]Like 6, 12, 10, 12-hour days?
[636:30.74]Rarely worth it to work that much.
[636:38.40]Yeah, just take care of yourselves.
[636:39.56]If you really are working that much, more than, like, 50-plus hours a week, 60 hours a week, I really hope you're taking care of yourself.
[636:52.69]That's what it takes to get through residency.
[636:54.49]Yeah.
[636:57.10]Nobody should work that much.
[637:00.80]Yeah, it's unfortunate.
[637:02.17]It really is unfortunate.
[637:07.61]Sometimes it's not a choice.
[637:08.75]Yeah.
[637:14.83]like working that much yeah then I mean if it I mean some people really love to stay busy and doing their job or their work is very fulfilling and they they love it and yeah absolutely but even still like that's a lot like 60 hours 70 hours a week for a job because you can start to burn out you can burn out like the sun
[637:48.37]Like I told you, back when I was working, before YouTube or Twitch or anything, you know, when I was working full-time, it was 30, 35, 40, maybe max, like 35.
[638:01.22]And even then, I couldn't imagine doubling that shit.
[638:07.30]That's a lot of time.
[638:14.29]Studies show that after 4 weeks, 60 hours a week becomes as productive as 40 hour weeks.
[638:20.12]It's stupid to work people like that.
[638:23.46]Yeah, there's a lot of research out there about shorter... And I'm a proponent of this as well.
[638:32.05]You are more productive the less you work.
[638:37.91]working three or four eight hour days is more productive than working seven six hour days seven five hour days in a row because this is how I feel as well I mean this is okay we're getting a little existential here I think but
[639:06.59]If somebody's happy and they have time to spend, don't you think that they would do a better job?
[639:16.23]Right?
[639:16.71]Don't you think that they would do a better job if they had three days off, four days off a week?
[639:24.41]Going to work and they would be like, alright, I'm ready.
[639:28.69]I'm ready to go.
[639:31.55]I'm a huge proponent of productivity versus time.
[639:37.79]Effective use of time rather than hours of time There are tons of studies that confirm this yeah It's really true.
[639:50.93]I wish we would pull back to like a four-day workweek We do so much good with so many people and we wouldn't even lose out on anything
[640:08.56]Ow!
[640:09.04]Oh, that hurt.
[640:10.11]That actually hurt.
[640:13.15]Oh!
[640:15.91]My mic just... Why did... What the fuck?
[640:17.99]Hold on.
[640:19.57]My mic just, like, unscrewed.
[640:29.75]My mic just unscrewed, and I, like, tried... It was, like, gonna fall.
[640:33.42]It was, like, loose or something, and I just, like, stubbed my fingernail.
[640:39.00]Oh, the rich are cutting his mic.
[640:40.98]I don't even think it's about money, though.
[640:44.00]Like, you can... If you're more productive, you'll make more money.
[640:48.34]If your workers are more productive, you're gonna make more money.
[640:51.32]If your workers like what they do for work, and they enjoy coming into work, they're gonna do more work when you ask them to.
[641:02.60]If I ever had a company, like, a real company, not like, oh, Jerma985, the e-clown dickhead.
[641:08.79]If I had a real company with, like, 50 employees or something, none of you motherfuckers is working more than four days a week.
[641:21.45]Like, under any circumstance.
[641:23.31]Unless, of course, if you wanted to, like, let's say you were like, ah, can I get some more hours?
[641:30.64]I really, I'm ready to go.
[641:31.62]I want to go, like, all, I want to go all this week.
[641:34.58]Alright.
[641:35.46]You got it.
[641:36.04]Let's go.
[641:42.66]God, please hire me!
[641:44.08]It'd be nice to, like, just run a big company and have tons of money and have a bunch of employees and... I would love to have, like, birthday parties for people.
[642:02.02]Is it weird that I think about this stuff?
[642:03.46]I would love to be, like, the CEO and, like, have, like, a surprise birthday party for workers.
[642:12.33]That would be so much fun.
[642:15.70]And we'd bring, like, games in and stuff.
[642:25.46]You'd be Michael from The Office.
[642:36.55]Gamer boss.
[642:37.37]It would be the...
[642:43.53]If you're happy and you like where you work, then you're gonna want to work better and harder.
[642:50.71]Not work smarter, not harder.
[642:53.45]Work smarter, not harder.
[642:55.27]It's such a simple concept.
[642:57.27]How is it so foreign to so many people that run companies?
[643:14.88]But what about that fifth and sixth day?
[643:17.38]We're going to lose profits.
[643:18.52]No, you won't.
[643:19.08]No, you won't.
[643:19.98]You'll make more money.
[643:21.21]You'll make more money.
[643:23.29]I bet you you'll make more money.
[643:26.15]More money, you say?
[643:27.13]Yes, a lot more money.
[643:28.53]Maybe I'll think about this.
[643:35.31]Four-day work week.
[643:38.57]More money.
[643:39.10]He said more money.
[643:40.10]Therefore, I should probably do it.
[643:47.66]The greedy grinner.
[643:51.58]Quick, make a company as a funny bit.
[643:53.88]I would just go bankrupt.
[643:54.92]I don't have the capital to be able to... Would you rob a bank?
[644:02.00]Come on, it's like midnight, man.
[644:09.20]But let's finish the bits.
[644:11.22]I could go off on a tangent of how work productivity is more important than numbers at the job.
[644:18.86]All day.
[644:19.74]You give me like Two Fingers of whiskey and sit me down.
[644:24.03]I could talk to you about this for like three hours.
[644:36.61]Go off the game.
[644:39.36]Hey, the point.
[644:42.86]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[644:43.75]Hey, Jerma back.
[644:44.67]LOL, by the way, these are a rare.
[644:47.53]Those are, oh, I thought those, nevermind.
[644:50.07]Those are great.
[644:50.85]I eat organic applesauce, squeeze things as a filler too sometimes.
[644:54.25]They're fun, but also a lot of plastic waste.
[644:57.58]Anyways, I'm getting interested in what you do.
[645:00.12]What do you listen to for music?
[645:02.00]I really like Rush, to be honest.
[645:04.34]Give like a top 10 bands you listen to.
[645:07.22]Gorillas?
[645:08.20]Gorillas.
[645:09.22]Gorillas?
[645:10.68]Whatever video game soundtrack I think is interesting at the time.
[645:15.00]Gorillas?
[645:17.32]Repeat the same three anime intros 200 times each until I don't care anymore.
[645:23.14]Gorillas?
[645:25.96]Uh...
[645:28.68]And... Moltar.
[645:47.11]I know, that's a lie.
[645:49.41]I don't really listen to music.
[645:52.64]I know.
[645:54.12]He eats baby food and doesn't listen to music.
[645:55.92]Okay, checkbox one, checkbox two.
[645:58.78]He is a sociopath.
[645:59.94]I know.
[646:00.38]Like, if you were a doctor, you'd probably be like, you're fucking something wrong with you.
[646:05.02]I don't really listen to music that much.
[646:12.40]He's a baby.
[646:17.04]Clip this and show it to the doctor.
[646:20.53]But thanks for the 300 bits.
[646:21.47]Appreciate it.
[646:22.77]Are you ever going to attempt the Royal Flush yourself on stream after doing some practice?
[646:32.12]Martin had a meme.
[646:32.98]Thanks for 250.
[646:33.78]Hey there, Whittle Jeremy.
[646:36.06]Baby Gap Gaming here.
[646:37.96]We're wondering if you'd like to be sponsored by us instead of the Big Boy Gap Gaming.
[646:41.84]We think our baby products fit more in line with your mentality and height.
[646:47.61]Martin had a meme.
[646:48.25]Thanks for the pretend.
[646:50.25]We're joking around, having a good time.
[646:52.57]Post stream.
[646:54.14]Having fun.
[646:55.10]Message.
[646:55.88]Thank you.
[646:58.04]Hey, Shusip.
[646:59.00]Thanks for the 300 vids.
[647:00.14]Hey, Jeremiah.
[647:00.60]I appreciate the content and streams.
[647:01.82]Helping me through some tough times.
[647:03.00]Keep it up.
[647:04.94]I wish you the best.
[647:08.87]Hopefully you get through what you're going through with ease.
[647:12.57]Hopefully it's not as hard.
[647:15.97]Not sure whatever it is, but I hope you get through it.
[647:19.83]Thank you.
[647:21.31]For the 300 bits.
[647:23.94]And finally, let's get to the end.
[647:28.64]This is the end.
[647:31.44]Silent Serenity with 250.
[647:32.36]Do you ever vent to Kim about how chat bullies you?
[647:40.45]No.
[647:43.69]No, I don't think so.
[647:48.45]I think about that so, well you guys think I turn the stream off and I just like go in there and I'm like, let me fucking tell you something.
[647:53.84]Man, I'm so sick of that shit.
[647:55.94]Like what the fuck, did you see what they said today?
[647:58.46]Did you, were you reading when they said that?
[648:00.54]They said like, oh like he's short, he's fucking stupid.
[648:05.05]These motherfuckers, let me tell you.
[648:08.53]No.
[648:10.67]I don't.
[648:12.85]I do not do that.
[648:14.84]You know what happens when I turn the stream off and I walk into the bedroom over there?
[648:18.89]You know my first words to Kim are usually every single time I turn the stream off?
[648:21.97]What do you think it is?
[648:22.51]What do you think it is?
[648:32.97]Yeah, it's... It's, I'm hungry.
[648:36.37]What do you want to do for food?
[648:37.73]Are you hungry?
[648:38.35]Have you eaten?
[648:43.60]You feel like anything in particular?
[648:46.16]You want to get sushi or something?
[648:48.54]You want to get Mediterranean?
[648:50.88]You want pizza?
[648:51.61]I'm hungry.
[648:58.69]It's midnight.
[648:59.23]Well, yeah, not tonight.
[649:04.68]We went late tonight.
[649:05.84]Typically, the streams turn up around 9 p.m., 9, 10 p.m.
[649:08.58]Pacific.
[649:13.14]I stream for, like, six and a half hours.
[649:15.36]Seven hours, typically.
[649:17.24]So, yeah, it's like eight, nine, nine o'clock.
[649:21.63]You go late every night.
[649:24.63]Only the last, like, couple weeks, really, have I been doing more than ten hour streams.
[649:31.63]This is... That's a pretty recent thing.
[649:33.28]It was very rare for me to go over nine hours.
[649:36.62]Very rare.
[649:41.56]But...
[649:42.97]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[649:44.43]For Diablo II.
[649:45.09]The streams have only been going long when you start early.
[649:52.55]But that's... We talked about that, though.
[649:54.17]That's another big point.
[649:56.19]Starting at, like, 1 to 2 p.m.
[649:57.71]Pacific, the streams can just go longer because it doesn't go until, like, 3 a.m.
[650:02.37]Pacific.
[650:04.07]Much easier to stay live when it's not too late for every single person.
[650:11.55]But I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[650:13.77]Much love to you.
[650:14.33]Get some rest.
[650:16.51]If we see you tomorrow, we see you tomorrow.
[650:17.73]If not, then maybe we'll see you again soon.
[650:20.51]Take care.
[650:23.51]Bye for now.
[650:45.45]Thank you.
