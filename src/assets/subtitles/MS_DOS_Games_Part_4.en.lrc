[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.69]Hello, everybody.
[00:02.31]Welcome.
[00:02.95]Welcome.
[00:07.35]I did hear about it.
[00:08.77]I've seen it.
[00:10.17]It's crazy.
[00:10.85]I think it's well open with that.
[00:14.58]So the TF2 economy doesn't exist anymore.
[00:18.96]Unusuals are just free.
[00:20.56]Everybody gets one.
[00:23.06]Yeah, I saw that.
[00:24.56]They're gonna fix it, though, right?
[00:25.70]They're gonna pull back any item that's been opened in the last, like, day or so.
[00:32.91]They'll do an unusual rollback period.
[00:38.21]And then everybody that sold their $3,000 TF2 hat for, like, three bucks, that might not... That's gonna... Just hold on to your stuff.
[00:48.98]Just hold.
[00:49.20]Hold on.
[01:00.13]This happened before?
[01:01.94]Yeah, it'll be, it'll probably be fine.
[01:04.80]It is like kind of humorous though to see screenshots of people's backpacks with like 50 unusuals that they opened.
[01:10.64]Like 10 minutes ago.
[01:15.56]I don't play TF2 anymore, but it's still interesting to keep up sometimes.
[01:23.96]He's telling you not to sell.
[01:24.92]Don't, just don't sell!
[01:26.01]You can't panic sell.
[01:31.45]You do what we all do.
[01:34.17]You hold that shit to zero.
[01:36.73]And then sell it for 30 cents.
[01:38.99]Yeah, buy high, don't sell.
[01:47.37]And then panic sell for less than 95% of your initial investment.
[01:59.46]Monster Rancher is getting ported, but I heard it was Japanese only.
[02:04.68]So.
[02:06.10]And how are they going to do that?
[02:07.66]It's going to be digital only port.
[02:12.08]It's just going to... What do you do?
[02:14.57]How do you do that without the discs?
[02:22.05]We'll see.
[02:23.15]But I heard that was only going to Japan first.
[02:30.13]So who knows if it'll ever show up in the North American market.
[02:37.74]Who knows?
[02:42.06]When am I going to go to Japan?
[02:43.38]I don't know.
[02:45.38]I've wanted to take a trip to Japan.
[02:48.90]Probably since I was 16, 17.
[02:51.54]Just one of those places that I've always wanted to go.
[02:58.74]Never had a chance.
[03:04.40]It's just an interesting place.
[03:09.91]No, it's not.
[03:10.39]It's not because of the anime.
[03:13.83]It's just... Japan's an interesting place.
[03:21.96]It really is.
[03:22.52]It seems really fun and interesting.
[03:24.00]Yeah.
[03:28.66]Oh, yeah.
[03:29.50]I can't wait to travel to Japan because of the anime.
[03:35.07]Sure.
[03:37.44]Not like the incredible culture and the massive history.
[03:44.28]No, no, no, no, no.
[03:45.10]Anime.
[03:45.72]That's why I want to go.
[03:56.57]Anyways, speaking of none of the things we're just talking about, we're going to play DOS games today.
[04:02.64]We're going to hang out for a little bit.
[04:06.14]I said a while ago I wanted to do DOS Knights.
[04:12.36]The last time we did this was probably three weeks ago.
[04:15.54]Maybe more.
[04:16.88]So, hey.
[04:18.14]DOS Knight number four or five, whatever the hell it is.
[04:24.48]And I have picked a few to start.
[04:27.90]Just to kind of get the ball rolling.
[04:30.50]Play Mario Sunshine or Riot.
[04:32.14]That's not a DOS game.
[04:33.69]That is a... That is Nintendo GameCube.
[04:37.27]That's not for Microsoft distributed online systems.
[04:40.55]What do you mean, yes it is?
[04:47.92]There's no MS-DOS version of Mario Sunshine.
[04:56.87]Sunshine was ported to DOS.
[04:59.05]How?
[05:00.68]Doesn't DOS, isn't the entire operating system of DOS a hundred kilobytes?
[05:10.20]No, I'm getting lied to.
[05:12.99]Anyways, let's go.
[05:15.95]I've already got it all set up.
[05:17.69]We'll do some picking later, but I saw a couple that I just had to click on immediately.
[05:24.45]And the first one we're going to do is, let's see if I can get it on here.
[05:29.86]Yeah, the first one we're going to do is called Donald Duck's Playground.
[05:37.26]By the Walt Disney Company.
[05:40.42]I just saw Donald Duck and I clicked it immediately.
[05:48.77]Okay, here we go.
[05:50.61]Let's get it on here.
[05:51.35]Are you going to work?
[05:56.37]Okay.
[05:58.15]Please work, please work, please work, please work!
[06:00.75]There we go.
[06:01.61]Donald Duck's playground!
[06:46.73]What are we doing?
[06:47.25]Oh, Donald wants to build a playground in the park for his nephews.
[06:52.19]Uh, he works in these stores to earn money.
[07:07.14]Hey, here's where he works!
[07:09.24]Alright, let's go.
[07:11.36]He works at the train station.
[07:18.79]Don- Donald buys toys for- How do I play?
[07:50.79]When words appear here, press the enter key or a joystick button.
[07:57.34]Okay, so the reason why I did that is so I don't have to do that for like another three years.
[08:04.90]I get asked to do that all the fucking time.
[08:10.54]So, there's three years worth of me doing that like six or seven out of ten beatbox.
[08:17.03]Okay.
[08:18.55]There you go.
[08:19.89]Alright, when words appear here, press the enter key or joystick button to continue, okay.
[08:26.17]Oh!
[08:30.16]I'm kidding, I'm not gonna do it again.
[08:31.36]Please walk through a doorway to choose a level.
[08:33.10]How do I walk through a doorway?
[08:34.40]Oh.
[08:43.59]It's taking me out.
[08:44.91]No, no, no, no.
[08:45.35]This is to give a game for children, right?
[08:46.85]I mean, I can do intermediate.
[08:54.47]He's doing the walk, if you guys know what I mean.
[08:56.97]Intermediate!
[09:02.04]Advance?
[09:03.22]No!
[09:03.78]Alright.
[09:04.06]You have to help me, though.
[09:16.18]Okay, so I have to... I'm moving way faster now.
[09:19.89]This controls like Snake, by the way.
[09:21.65]I can't control this.
[09:26.36]Toys!
[09:26.96]How long do you want to work a two minute shift?
[09:36.35]Yeah, I want to work a one minute shift, please.
[09:41.34]Sure.
[09:43.20]Let's go.
[09:45.42]Use the joystick or arrow keys to change the minutes below.
[09:48.28]Press the button to start work.
[09:49.72]What do you mean, press the button?
[09:57.33]Press the button?
[10:01.55]What button?
[10:10.37]Press it!
[10:11.21]I can't!
[10:15.84]Press the button!
[10:17.08]There is no button to press!
[10:18.58]How do I walk?
[10:22.52]Press any key.
[10:25.20]Enter.
[10:26.99]I think I would have a- I need to play this, come on!
[10:30.34]W-A-S-D, no.
[10:32.44]M. B. B for button.
[10:35.84]P. L. K. Space.
[10:39.72]Shift.
[10:42.66]Right.
[10:43.70]F. G. H. Z!
[10:48.88]It's not Z. Dammit, I have to play this.
[10:53.50]It's X!
[10:56.31]The Amquack special will pass in zero minutes.
[11:00.09]What?
[11:07.38]This is... This is... Every single Super Nintendo RPG you've ever played, there's a sequence where the character freaks out and runs around to collect stuff.
[11:16.25]And this is it.
[11:18.65]Oh, I got it!
[11:19.09]Put it in the trash?
[11:21.07]Oh, what?
[11:26.04]What am I supposed to do?
[11:27.40]Am I just breaking shit?
[11:31.78]I'm breaking stuff.
[11:35.48]Oh, guys, this is gonna be impossible.
[11:36.88]I need to go... What?
[11:44.19]Um...
[11:57.29]It's playing Pac-Man, only times 5 speed.
[12:01.57]I have to get it perfect.
[12:08.14]It's too many FPS.
[12:12.44]Anyone know how to- how do I fix this?
[12:24.17]I think there's a way I can, right?
[12:28.98]Do I have to make my monitor, like, 30 hertz?
[12:39.51]How is- I have no money.
[12:44.01]Turn down the cycles.
[12:45.71]Right click, set FPS, custom jebaited.
[12:48.41]Fuck.
[12:51.29]Why?
[12:54.22]I have to lower the speed of this TPU.
[12:56.78]I know there's a way you can do it from inside here.
[12:58.78]Somebody know the key?
[13:01.62]Go into the DOS box options.
[13:10.82]I know there's a way to do it.
[13:11.84]Somebody showed me this before, didn't they?
[13:13.08]Alright, well it's gonna wait till 37 seconds is up.
[13:18.62]F11?
[13:25.78]I'm just gonna wait till I fail.
[13:30.42]Somebody said, do you guys ever get tired of tormenting this man?
[13:36.65]What do you mean tormenting this man?
[13:39.15]So wait, control F11.
[13:40.45]Is that gonna like open up fucking Siri or something?
[13:42.94]Like somebody, I need somebody to confirm this.
[13:48.76]That's not gonna open up like, oh, it's me, Siri.
[13:51.54]Siri.
[13:55.05]Control F11 slows it down.
[13:56.61]It's the Siri hotkey.
[13:59.69]Time's up.
[14:00.29]Press a button to leave.
[14:01.26]Okay, listen.
[14:01.76]You've earned nothing.
[14:03.58]For a second I thought it was putting me in jail.
[14:12.30]Does that work?
[14:13.48]I need at least like a 95% in chat.
[14:15.06]People say it's Control plus Shift plus T is time.
[14:23.41]Control F11.
[14:23.89]Control F11.
[14:28.74]Did it work?
[14:31.09]It did.
[14:32.53]Right?
[14:33.05]Okay, yeah.
[14:33.93]Thank God for some of these fucking super brains in chat.
[14:43.11]Five for ten dollars.
[14:44.23]Let's see what this does.
[14:51.37]You have zero dollars.
[14:52.77]Rocking horse.
[14:56.47]Who is that?
[14:59.71]Why am I shaking?
[15:01.17]Hey!
[15:02.46]Hey!
[15:02.74]Do you have any of those things I made for my nephews?
[15:05.54]Like, slow down.
[15:06.38]That's a tetherball?
[15:22.73]Donald, like, crack duck.
[15:25.85]Alright, let's go to hardware store.
[15:27.61]Let me go to work.
[15:29.78]Do I have to work for Mickey?
[15:33.18]Hey, Mickey!
[15:35.36]Enter?
[15:35.72]No?
[15:38.07]I can't do a Donald Duck voice, so I'm not even gonna try.
[15:40.57]I forgot this is a tutorial for a child's game.
[15:58.36]No, no, I didn't.
[15:59.16]What I did is I was going... Alright, I was going 5,000 miles per hour in a child's game.
[16:08.65]There's a difference.
[16:23.71]Okay, how long do you... Let's... Here we go.
[16:25.93]I want to work for... I don't want to do that long.
[16:29.19]Let's do a two-minute shift.
[16:30.93]Alright, now, what do I have to do?
[16:37.15]Am I Donald Duck the Air Traffic Controller?
[16:41.63]What am I doing?
[16:49.54]Okay, we got...
[16:53.59]What?
[16:54.47]What's the plan?
[16:56.37]What do I do?
[16:57.78]This goes into... What?
[17:02.86]Okay, this is luggage, I think.
[17:04.34]Okay, luggage.
[17:10.70]Is that going in?
[17:11.64]I'm just throwing luggage out the window.
[17:18.30]Oh, Las Vegas!
[17:19.10]I want that one!
[17:20.91]No, no, give me that.
[17:27.07]I didn't catch it, apparently.
[17:29.33]What airport is S?
[17:32.67]I'm hitting the button when it comes by, alright?
[17:34.69]I swear.
[17:35.23]Alright, there you go.
[17:43.22]I need to... This...
[17:53.01]Okay, I got it.
[17:53.49]I'm good.
[17:54.87]I really hope this is... No, I've only earned 36 cents.
[18:01.07]That's pretty unbelievable, actually.
[18:04.39]Well, I mean, for one minute of work?
[18:07.21]What does that turn out to be for an hour?
[18:23.79]I just let go of it.
[18:26.25]Okay.
[18:26.77]You can't let go of the ass airport.
[18:29.95]Oh, I have to actually put it back down in the... Okay.
[18:37.00]ORD.
[18:37.36]Come on.
[18:46.16]So, what?
[18:46.58]81 cents?
[18:46.90]Is it Atlanta?
[18:50.26]Alright.
[18:51.08]Time's up.
[18:51.50]81 cents for a minute of work.
[18:54.77]That's a dollar a minute.
[18:57.45]That's a pretty good job.
[18:59.79]That's... That's $60 an hour.
[19:10.40]You earned... Did they take taxes out?
[19:20.93]No.
[19:21.57]You earned 81 cents.
[19:24.25]Okay, that's cool.
[19:25.27]So now what do I want to buy?
[19:26.09]I need to buy toys for the park.
[19:28.49]What about the train station?
[19:34.66]Donald Duck doesn't pay his taxes.
[19:46.84]No, you can't teach kids about taxes this early.
[19:51.85]How long do you want to work?
[19:53.09]Um...
[19:55.81]You have to do at least a three minute... No, one minute.
[20:01.28]This is Advanced Railroad.
[20:04.48]So I have to route cars?
[20:07.30]Pick up at Duck City.
[20:10.48]Which one is that?
[20:11.22]Duck City is... Where is Duck City?
[20:13.12]Four?
[20:18.66]What?
[20:19.96]No, no, no, no.
[20:20.50]I have to... Okay, hold on.
[20:21.28]I have to route it.
[20:22.36]Where's it going?
[20:27.20]Alright, pick up a Duck City.
[20:28.16]We need to route you from... No, go this way, Donald.
[20:30.42]What are you doing?
[20:30.88]Okay, when I press left twice, he goes right.
[20:34.96]Oh, it's because he just stops.
[20:48.05]He stops.
[20:48.51]No, he doesn't.
[20:49.81]Three.
[20:52.65]I need to turn him...
[20:55.87]No, he's about to go to Duckburg.
[21:01.29]I desperately want to just turn at 4.
[21:04.78]It needs to happen at 4 or 5.
[21:06.60]Well, I didn't do anything.
[21:20.15]I have to at least buy one item before I move on.
[21:22.39]What's this one?
[21:26.98]Zero dollars an hour.
[21:28.26]Well, that would be zero dollars in a minute.
[21:32.48]How long do you want to work?
[21:33.48]Uh, one, uh, two minutes.
[21:37.10]So this is a catch the... I think I figured it out.
[21:41.75]Alright, I'm gonna make a ton of money on this one.
[21:44.55]Wait, why do they need meat?
[21:48.61]He just threw it in there.
[21:49.57]Okay, hold on.
[21:57.15]You can clearly just make the throw.
[22:02.38]Why do I have to be here to catch it?
[22:04.08]That guy could walk two or three feet to the left and make the throw.
[22:14.73]This is so sloppy.
[22:19.53]Because I can't stop moving.
[22:21.00]When I hit right, he just keeps going all the way to the right.
[22:27.94]Donald Duck, you suck.
[22:31.00]Oh my god.
[22:56.51]I can't do it, man.
[22:57.88]It's too... I know what's going on.
[23:00.58]My CPU was on too slow.
[23:25.14]What the fuck happened with that?
[23:26.06]It just dropped off.
[23:30.28]I didn't catch that one somehow.
[23:35.28]Oh my god, whatever.
[23:37.82]I don't care.
[23:38.48]He made, what, 40 cents?
[23:42.28]That's actually pound for pound better than the other one.
[23:43.86]Alright, what is that?
[23:48.48]I have $1.17.
[23:51.57]Can I get, can I afford, let's, let's, every time I get out here I want to go a little faster.
[23:57.99]I think I've done all the jobs I could do.
[24:05.37]Ten dollars.
[24:06.27]Five dollars and ten dollars.
[24:07.48]What about junk?
[24:11.04]Do the nephews care that much?
[24:17.52]Old box.
[24:21.75]Slide for fort.
[24:25.17]Tire swing.
[24:25.93]71 cents for the tire swing.
[24:28.24]Okay, hold on.
[24:30.18]Rope and pulley.
[24:33.14]Ladder to treehouse.
[24:34.12]Alright, well, let's get the old box.
[24:38.84]Let's get him a cardboard box.
[24:42.16]Hello, says Goofy.
[24:43.44]Walk to the item you want.
[24:44.44]Press the button to take it.
[24:46.18]Pay me for it over here.
[25:02.40]Alright, you have to pay.
[25:03.94]Where am I?
[25:04.42]I'm just kidding, Goofy.
[25:09.44]Don't worry.
[25:09.78]Alright, I want the tire swing and I want the cardboard box.
[25:23.19]Okay.
[25:25.33]Please pay for your purchases now.
[25:29.39]Yeah.
[25:32.36]Please pay for your purchases now.
[25:33.80]You owe a dollar nine.
[25:36.04]You have a dollar... Alright, a dollar... I told you it's playing Snake.
[25:40.24]I can't stop this.
[25:47.70]Okay, twenty... When you are done, move the arrow to the register, T, total key, and press the button.
[26:03.15]Okay, 50 cents.
[26:03.82]75 cents.
[26:04.12]85 cents.
[26:11.64]95 cents.
[26:11.80]Do I have enough?
[26:12.34]I don't have enough.
[26:21.85]No, I do.
[26:23.91]There's a dollar right here.
[26:35.51]Dollar five.
[26:37.57]Do I get change?
[26:42.31]Goofy will give me change, right?
[26:43.61]Alright, that's it.
[26:48.43]Give me change, Goofy.
[26:51.03]Thank you.
[26:51.41]Please make change.
[26:53.62]Why don't... Wait, did I just... Do I have to walk behind the counter and make the change?
[26:58.64]Goofy, what the hell do you do here?
[27:08.64]I don't know anything about math, Donald.
[27:11.34]It's okay, Goofy.
[27:13.18]I'll take care of you.
[27:27.74]No, I don't want to give it back.
[27:28.86]Oh, God.
[27:34.12]Okay, press button to leave.
[27:40.07]Goofy's just fucking really dumb.
[27:50.41]This is just paper Goofy!
[27:53.05]The coins are the real valuable ones!
[27:56.48]Well that makes sense.
[28:03.62]I'm not done with this one.
[28:08.84]I write on paper every day.
[28:11.99]Not every day that I see silver.
[28:17.19]Alright, I'm gonna do this one.
[28:25.03]Move faster, Donald.
[28:26.51]Fuck.
[28:27.63]Alright, I'll do two minutes.
[28:29.89]Now that I have... I can actually do it.
[28:31.66]Alright, slow down, though.
[28:33.66]This is still too fast.
[28:34.72]Alright.
[28:36.52]No, no, no, give me this.
[28:39.71]Have I figured out what the hell is going on here?
[28:44.35]Do I have to put this up here?
[28:45.53]Actually, I don't know what I'm doing.
[28:49.35]I have no idea what I'm doing.
[28:52.73]Do I have to get- I think I have to get this... ...from the top shelf?
[29:02.27]I have to push the ladder.
[29:03.45]How do I push the ladder?
[29:08.24]Oh my god.
[29:33.05]Oh no, catch it!
[29:38.80]I don't know, I don't understand this part.
[29:42.88]Is this... This one's broken, it just is.
[29:47.52]Okay.
[29:48.74]I can't fix this one.
[29:52.34]There's not like a... What's the Freddy pizza game?
[29:58.05]This is not a... What the hell is it called?
[30:00.93]Five Nights at Freddy's.
[30:02.15]We're like, oh, something crazy is going to happen.
[30:04.13]Donald Duck's going to murder somebody.
[30:10.60]That's actually, the game is broken.
[30:11.88]Alright, how do I just skip work?
[30:46.99]I like this Donald Duck, though.
[30:49.08]This Donald Duck is really cute, don't you think?
[30:55.02]Alright, let's go.
[31:01.05]You earned nothing.
[31:01.73]I have six cents.
[31:04.39]When does this game end?
[31:14.91]Can I leave this area?
[31:15.89]This part of town?
[31:25.45]Wait.
[31:25.65]I just went in the well?
[31:27.87]No.
[31:28.45]Oh, the park!
[31:28.83]There's the park.
[31:29.31]Okay, let's go.
[31:34.15]Can I, like, piss on the hydrant?
[31:39.56]Duckburg City Park.
[31:41.12]Like, can I get on the train?
[31:48.26]Wait.
[31:48.80]Oh, I looked both ways before crossing the street.
[31:56.55]Donald Duck is really, like, fucking playing with his life here.
[32:00.03]Alright, let's go.
[32:05.13]Is this still Donald Duck?
[32:13.68]Oh, this is Huey.
[32:18.56]Do I have to bring the items with me?
[32:26.06]Are these Mickey's gallows?
[32:43.53]Can I just walk all the way?
[32:44.87]Is there anything over here?
[32:48.16]No, I have to go... That's like the boys' little hut or something, right?
[32:56.11]Can you get hit by the train?
[32:57.87]I'm going to say 100% no.
[33:00.91]I don't think they would code in Donald Duck getting hit by a fucking train.
[33:07.54]In... Alright.
[33:08.04]I'm going to do the airport one again.
[33:10.42]I got money on this one.
[33:11.18]I'm going to get some more money.
[33:19.41]Alright, I'm gonna do two minutes of this, and then, uh, I know you guys want me to move on, but I can't.
[33:24.77]This is gonna be really, very fast.
[33:26.17]Hold on, slow it down.
[33:26.85]Okay, I'll get, I'm gonna do this quick.
[33:36.58]No, no, get it.
[33:37.88]BMG, BTR, JFK, and TVL.
[33:45.58]Let me make it, let me just at least get one more, like, cool item for the kids, you know what I mean?
[33:55.05]What?
[33:55.59]Oh, fuck.
[33:58.53]Come on.
[34:01.73]BTR.
[34:04.81]JFK.
[34:08.57]BMG.
[34:10.05]You idiot.
[34:15.30]How much more time do I have?
[34:15.94]I have a lot of time.
[34:19.90]I gotta get five bucks to buy something cool in, like, Mickey's store.
[34:23.50]Or is it Minnie's store?
[34:24.24]I don't know who's in there.
[34:26.81]BTR.
[34:30.35]I have a new strategy.
[34:35.97]It's called do the minimum amount of work.
[34:43.19]What?
[34:43.73]Oh, it's BTL.
[34:54.90]No, I'm gonna stick with the original strategy.
[34:56.26]BTR.
[35:03.17]That's close enough.
[35:03.77]$1.35?
[35:05.41]Come on.
[35:05.67]Shit.
[35:06.01]I should've just stayed in BTR.
[35:24.86]Come on.
[35:25.60]Like, three of them just went by.
[35:26.99]Four of them went by.
[35:28.21]Where are... Come on, where are they?
[35:32.03]They had no more?
[35:33.31]Maybe the game knows I'm trying to do that.
[35:34.79]Oh, whatever.
[35:36.45]$1.62.
[35:38.85]He's still playing this.
[35:39.79]I know.
[35:41.17]Sometimes when you find one, you have to stick with it to see what happens.
[35:46.40]We got paper money now.
[35:56.88]Okay.
[35:58.80]I'm gonna do... What's another easy one?
[36:02.56]The train one is all over the place for me.
[36:06.24]This one.
[36:06.90]I'll get this one.
[36:08.10]The farm one.
[36:13.12]It's been on this game for a half an hour.
[36:17.33]No, I haven't.
[36:20.91]It has not been a half an hour.
[36:32.78]Has it?
[36:33.10]Yeah, it actually has been half an hour.
[36:37.58]Oh, man.
[36:39.92]Um, it's alright.
[36:41.28]It's alright.
[36:42.08]Let me just put one object in.
[36:44.42]Let me just go to my house.
[36:50.23]What?
[36:50.63]Why did I drop that?
[36:56.55]No, this one sucks.
[36:58.49]Okay, can I afford anything for two dollars?
[37:06.06]No, this is not enough money.
[37:08.06]I'm doing it really well right now, and it doesn't matter.
[37:14.92]That's it.
[37:15.20]How did that not go in the tomato bucket?
[37:18.29]Oh my god.
[37:18.91]33 cents.
[37:20.15]Alright, I'm gonna buy something.
[37:30.63]Look, it's teaching kids how to count money with their hands.
[37:38.80]Alright, here we go.
[37:40.90]I'm gonna go buy a cool toy, and then... I'll be done.
[37:45.48]And we can move on to the next one that I have here.
[37:51.64]Donald Duck can barely make ends meet, yet he spends his last change on his children's gifts for Christmas.
[37:56.16]Donald can go hungry tonight for his children's joy in their faces.
[38:10.45]What the fuck?
[38:11.49]That's fucked up.
[38:13.45]Alright, what do we got?
[38:14.85]Alright, I can do the, uh, tether ball is $1.99.
[38:19.77]Rocking horse is, okay, let's get the rocking horse.
[38:28.08]Please pay for your money.
[38:29.12]Alright, I don't want, I want to keep the dollar.
[38:39.12]Put it on the counter.
[38:43.02]When you are done, move to the T. Yeah, I know.
[38:50.68]57 cents.
[38:57.19]Press done now.
[38:57.97]What do you mean press done now?
[39:05.33]It's going to tell me I'm wrong.
[39:07.92]Sorry, no sale.
[39:09.89]Yeah.
[39:11.55]There's no, like, bartering system.
[39:15.33]Alright, that's 55, 57.
[39:17.03]One more penny.
[39:23.90]Your purchase will be delivered.
[39:25.84]Well, delivered where?
[39:31.90]How do I just go back to my house?
[39:35.81]Where is it being delivered to?
[39:38.74]To the park?
[39:40.48]Alright, if it's not at the park, then I'm moving on.
[39:49.97]Guillermo, please, this game is killing me.
[40:02.02]I like this one.
[40:08.62]Where is my stuff?
[40:11.48]They're not actually sending it to me.
[40:17.19]Wait.
[40:18.79]Oh shit.
[40:20.57]Found it.
[40:26.09]And you guys didn't want to see.
[40:29.49]I can play with all the toys as Huey.
[40:32.05]Tire swing.
[40:39.56]Nice.
[40:41.36]Really, really nice.
[40:42.28]Alright, what else is there?
[40:43.06]Where's my box?
[40:50.15]Do you see the cardboard box?
[40:56.19]That was kind of cute for 30 seconds.
[40:58.79]Yeah, we had to get a payoff.
[41:00.09]Even if it took 40 minutes.
[41:08.64]So what is supposed to go up there?
[41:12.30]Keep playing this so chat can suffer.
[41:20.36]A little confused by... So Donald Duck somehow can't afford to buy cardboard boxes and has to work for a dollar, but has a Elon Musk space shuttle in his backyard.
[41:40.84]Well, we know how he lost all of his money.
[41:43.32]Why is this a slide?
[41:45.02]Hold on.
[41:46.46]This is important.
[41:52.50]Is this a... Like a water slide that's a themed water slide?
[42:06.33]That's my favorite.
[42:10.70]Jump on and jump off.
[42:12.86]That's all you need.
[42:14.61]This can be so many things.
[42:18.67]I want to go to the slide.
[42:20.03]Can I go to the other side?
[42:21.03]No, that's it.
[42:28.49]It's just a rocket back here.
[42:31.49]Get the ladder.
[42:33.78]Hold on.
[42:35.24]Do I have to get the ladder?
[42:39.12]How much is the ladder?
[42:44.48]Speed up time.
[42:45.06]I think it says maximum speed.
[42:52.00]Yeah, this is at max speed, guys.
[42:53.70]Alright, let me just get the ladder and let me go up.
[42:56.31]I want to do the slider.
[42:57.01]This will be quick.
[43:00.61]Where's the ladder?
[43:01.09]Hardware.
[43:02.71]How much is it?
[43:05.03]No, it's not.
[43:05.31]Where is it?
[43:06.55]Ship's wheel.
[43:08.57]Hand walking rope.
[43:11.43]No.
[43:11.85]Where is it?
[43:18.17]There it is.
[43:19.55]$2.95.
[43:19.57]What do I have?
[43:20.01]$1.46?
[43:20.09]I got it.
[43:20.93]I got it.
[43:30.17]I'll do this really fast.
[43:31.01]We're gonna do, uh, just, uh, this one.
[43:33.90]The airport one.
[43:35.72]It's really fast speed.
[43:37.00]I make a dollar.
[43:37.60]I'm done.
[43:38.10]Just hold on.
[43:38.52]Wait.
[43:38.86]One minute.
[43:39.20]Go.
[43:42.40]I just want to see if we can get up on the top of the slide.
[43:43.84]Because the, uh...
[43:49.78]This is going too fast.
[43:54.96]Alright, I need, uh... I need lip.
[44:03.70]BTL, come on.
[44:09.36]Oh, come on.
[44:10.78]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[44:11.86]Stop, stop, stop.
[44:16.78]Really?
[44:17.82]I need a dollar.
[44:18.88]I need one dollar.
[44:19.84]Pick it up.
[44:20.34]Oh, God.
[44:28.13]No, that's BTR.

[44:36.69]It's on too fast.
[44:43.68]How much do I have?
[44:47.29]171, 181.
[44:47.33]199.
[44:48.79]How much is the ladder?
[44:51.72]Two something, right?
[44:52.38]I'll do it again.
[44:57.84]I need to see what the ladder does.
[44:59.40]Like, this is the only... I will never have this opportunity again in my entire life.
[45:04.96]Nobody.
[45:05.52]You'll never see this again.
[45:07.08]Ever.
[45:08.20]Don't you need to know?
[45:17.95]I need to take 50 cents, 60 cents.
[45:21.35]I need to know.
[45:26.21]Oh my god, why can I not pick anything up?
[45:29.92]BTL, PSP... I just... It's hard to... I can't even read them.
[45:49.47]Come on, one more.
[45:52.65]Oh my god.
[45:55.65]BTL.
[45:57.37]Alright, I got it.
[45:58.17]I got enough.
[46:03.17]I'm gonna have exact change.
[46:04.45]No, I'm not.
[46:04.76]Alright, I'm good.
[46:07.78]Let's go.
[46:13.76]It was 240 something, wasn't it?
[46:26.45]Speed it up.
[46:32.44]Don't get the ladder, get the catwalk.
[46:38.04]I- for real?
[46:42.22]Catwalk- catwalk to rocket slide!
[46:44.78]Oh fuck, it's $2.99.
[46:45.32]Do I need both?
[46:55.00]I need both.
[46:56.20]Alright, I'll do this quick.
[46:58.21]This is the one that makes the most money.
[46:59.63]I have to do this, like, a few times.
[47:00.87]How many times do I have to do this?
[47:02.65]Get alone.
[47:03.15]That's not how this works.
[47:05.39]Um, no, I gotta do- I have to do this one.
[47:07.03]I have to.
[47:11.31]Just- I'm gonna do- okay.
[47:13.12]I'm gonna do this for five minutes.
[47:14.62]No, I'm not.
[47:15.06]That's way too long.
[47:15.76]Three minutes.
[47:16.48]It's four minutes.
[47:17.06]Alright, this is the last time you're ever gonna see this.
[47:25.08]Okay.
[47:26.34]Slow it down, slow it down.
[47:27.22]I got four minutes.
[47:29.19]Of the worst content you will ever see on the stream.
[47:33.57]Is this game.
[47:35.91]But it's okay.
[47:37.39]Because, no, actually, never mind.
[47:38.53]I take that back.
[47:39.41]It's the best.
[47:47.59]I just need, like, three bucks.
[47:50.69]HML.
[47:51.07]No, no, no.
[47:51.47]PSP HML lacks ATL.
[47:55.92]How did I miss that?
[47:56.56]Okay, double, triple, come on.
[48:01.36]Oh my god, I'm throwing in the wrong one.
[48:02.56]What an idiot.
[48:13.53]I just need to see what it does.
[48:18.15]PSP.
[48:19.27]LAX.
[48:22.40]I'm gonna stay back here.
[48:26.63]You have to stay all the way to the right so I can see them.
[48:34.68]That's a dollar.
[48:38.54]What do I even have in my hands?
[48:39.34]Okay.
[48:42.79]LAX.
[48:45.77]Atlanta.
[48:51.65]Um... Atlanta.
[48:54.70]Shit.
[48:59.73]Two hours on this Donald... Two hours on this Donald fuck garbage.
[49:07.07]It's been... It's been an hour, but it's been 50 minutes.
[49:12.46]Just hold on.
[49:14.82]Just hold on.
[49:16.68]Don't worry.
[49:17.70]It'll... It'll be worth it.
[49:31.26]What is PSP?
[49:34.00]What airport is PSP?
[49:36.60]Pennsylvania?
[49:39.14]Philadelphia?
[49:47.07]PlayStation Portable.
[49:48.11]Yeah, I know.
[49:48.99]I understand that that's the joke, but what is it actually?
[49:56.91]I definitely have enough for both now.
[50:02.26]What's going on?
[50:04.68]I still have a minute and 25 seconds left in my shift.
[50:11.11]Oh, he's coming back.
[50:13.37]Okay, he's wrapping around.
[50:17.11]PSP, please stop playing.
[50:24.46]Nope, I'm not gonna... Oh, there's only one more!
[50:37.21]Uh, you guys.
[50:38.75]You guys.
[50:39.79]Come on.
[50:41.15]Let me have, let me, you gotta let me have some, some time.
[50:44.97]I wanna see what the slide looks like in the Donald Duck game.
[50:50.04]Give me a break.
[50:51.22]Just because I wanna sit here and see what it does.
[50:54.48]And look, every, all the, all the people that have, they're talking shit right now.
[50:59.00]We'll see.
[50:59.84]We'll see when you see the slide.
[51:02.72]I guarantee you half the people that are like, oh, no, no, get out of here, are gonna be like, oh, PogChamp!
[51:07.88]When I slide down that fucking thing.
[51:12.00]Oh, I have to work, right.
[51:24.39]Worth, totally worth.
[51:26.29]I'm gonna say worth.
[51:28.17]Right now, it just spammed like a thousand times.
[51:37.11]Alright, I need, uh, I need... Hue.
[51:43.83]I definitely have enough.
[51:45.01]I think.

[51:50.06]I got three builds now.
[51:54.94]It's 240 for the... Alright, I definitely have enough.
[51:58.40]I got five bucks.
[51:59.26]At least.
[52:08.54]Oh, it's counting the coins up and giving me new denominations.
[52:12.74]Alright, I got $5.60.
[52:16.52]I'm ready.
[52:23.61]Look, everybody else doesn't understand.
[52:25.47]I get to be in the Guinness Book of World Records for an incredibly specific thing.
[52:32.98]I streamed this for an hour.
[52:35.18]No one else on Earth has ever done that.
[52:37.68]Ever.
[52:38.10]I get to be in that book.
[52:46.00]You know, I'm probably listed in that book like a hundred times.
[52:51.29]You have $5.
[52:52.51]Catwalk to the rocket slide.
[52:53.73]Yes.
[52:54.91]And then the ladder, right?
[52:58.15]Hand walking rope.
[53:00.57]Ship's wheel.
[53:01.75]Trampoline.
[53:03.90]Somersault bar.
[53:07.94]Okay.
[53:08.86]So then I do this and get the ladder.
[53:12.68]Please pay.
[53:13.22]Alright, just take it.
[53:15.02]Just take my money already.
[53:19.05]I got like 3,400 people here that are just screaming at me to hurry this up.
[53:22.89]Alright, let's do- I'm getting three bucks.
[53:32.92]And give me back one penny.
[53:36.02]No.
[53:43.23]Please make change.
[53:43.95]Yes.
[53:46.63]Why is this going so slow?
[53:51.57]Done.
[53:53.60]Alright.
[53:55.46]Now we need the ladder.
[54:04.64]Okay, let me just make sure.
[54:06.66]Rings.
[54:08.14]Ladder to rocket ship.
[54:27.29]I have to.
[54:28.05]I just bought the scaffolding.
[54:30.22]I can't not do this.
[54:31.66]It's been too long.
[54:32.86]One minute.
[54:33.44]Go.
[54:33.70]I just need to throw three baggages.
[54:38.94]Just wait.
[54:39.46]Just hold on.
[54:40.32]Just bear with me.
[54:41.20]I'm just gonna stand here and do JFK only.
[54:52.75]How many?
[54:53.21]What do I need?
[54:58.52]It's 299, right?
[55:04.62]I have enough now.
[55:08.73]JFK, come on.
[55:11.71]JFK, come on.
[55:12.41]Alright, it's not showing me JFK.
[55:13.59]Throw, like, an Oak.
[55:17.76]Oak and JFK only.
[55:28.23]I got enough, right?
[55:28.91]Yeah, no, I have to.
[55:29.63]Yeah, I definitely have enough.
[55:34.45]100%.
[55:36.17]I'm just gonna go in there and just dump all my change on the counter and just leave.
[55:39.76]I don't even care about making change.
[55:51.05]Oh, it's gonna do another dollar?
[55:56.53]Okay, if the rocket lifts off and takes off, as like a funny cartoon joke, you owe me an apology.
[56:07.11]If I just slide down the slide and that's it, I owe you an apology.
[56:17.01]Okay.
[56:18.63]We're both in on this.
[56:29.93]Ladder to the rocket ship, $2.95.
[56:31.21]Let's go.
[56:36.83]Please pay for your purchases.
[56:40.01]Give me the dollar.
[56:45.05]Are these... Is that implying it's very heavy?
[56:47.48]Because look at my hand.
[56:50.52]Oh, I got a frog in my throat.
[56:52.54]Alright, I need the $2.95.
[56:54.08]Dollar...
[56:56.63]125, 150, 175.
[56:56.75]Two dollars.
[56:57.57]Okay, 225.
[56:57.69]250.
[56:57.93]I'm a fucking old lady paying for an ice cream.
[57:00.55]275.
[57:02.11]Okay, 280.
[57:25.02]Two... ninety.
[57:27.90]I'm just sitting there behind her, just going like, GET A FUCKING CREDIT CARD!
[57:31.82]It's not hard.
[57:32.92]It's very easy.
[57:33.74]Alright, uh, what was it?
[57:37.98]I forgot.
[57:38.32]295?
[57:38.62]What am I at?
[57:44.88]Oh, why?
[57:46.04]You startled me.
[57:47.25]I don't know.
[57:49.33]Where?
[57:49.53]How much is up there?
[57:53.97]Let's go.
[58:08.70]I'd like to pay with exact change so the government can't track me.
[58:14.64]I don't think the government gives a shit that you're buying a large ice cream from Ben & Jerry's.
[58:18.69]Alright?
[58:19.63]Come on.
[58:31.45]Buy the boom box.
[58:35.50]Here we go.
[58:37.16]This is it.
[58:39.01]Oh, this is going to be awesome.
[58:40.01]I can't wait.
[58:44.15]That's straw man propaganda.
[58:47.25]I'm going in.
[58:47.79]Let's go.
[58:51.22]It's going to take off.
[58:53.02]Do it.
[58:53.38]Take off.
[58:54.82]This is huge.
[58:55.80]Alright, this counts.
[58:57.38]You thought it was just going to be that top screen.
[58:58.76]This counts.
[59:01.32]Oh my god, why is there like a 200 foot... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[59:08.19]Go back.
[59:10.21]I wouldn't do this, this is scary.
[59:11.49]Alright, you owe me apol- You owe me an apology!
[59:21.88]Alright, you- Are you kidding me?
[59:26.38]He just did a double front flip.
[59:27.76]You owe me an apology.
[59:30.06]I'm doing it again.
[59:44.55]The one resident sleeper in there is probably my favorite.
[59:48.39]I would puke if I was up here.
[59:53.95]This is not safe.
[59:54.65]These are children.
[60:00.10]Double front flip.
[60:00.80]You don't get an apology from me.
[60:03.12]That's better than the ship taking off.
[60:13.71]Okay.
[60:18.09]Lame.
[60:19.23]Lame.
[60:20.63]So... bald.
[60:21.93]I'm not gonna read that.
[60:25.80]Alright, let me ask you a question.
[60:27.78]If I kept this and turned the volume up all the way, and muted my microphone and left the room and zoomed in on the box, would the viewers go up or down?
[60:47.51]Okay, this next one.
[60:50.71]I remember playing this a long time ago.
[60:52.21]I don't remember anything about it, but I remember it being a thing.
[60:56.85]Shufflepuck Cafe.
[60:59.76]I'm not going to do that.
[61:06.42]Apologize now.
[61:08.54]I'm sorry that you feel that way.
[61:15.41]So Shufflepuck Cafe is a
[61:18.82]You fight against other people playing Shufflepuck.
[61:21.89]Of course you do.
[61:23.37]Anyways.
[61:23.65]I don't know if I want to select my video card.
[61:26.71]Game.
[61:29.35]Is it mouse?
[61:34.18]This game is weird.
[61:36.58]You know, um... What's that Christopher Robin game where you have to hit the baseball and hit a home run?
[61:41.80]Winnie the Pooh, Christopher Robin Baseball.
[61:45.85]Whatever it's called.
[61:52.71]The whole, like, whatever it is.
[61:54.11]It's kinda like that.
[61:54.99]They progressively just get insanely difficult.
[62:02.39]Okay, here we go.
[62:09.62]So, uh, you pick an opponent.
[62:11.28]Let's pick the pig.
[62:25.47]This is not a porn game.
[62:26.19]What are you talking about?
[62:29.78]Oh my god, that was... Is it turned up or does it turn down?
[62:36.76]I think I might have turned it up too high.
[62:38.06]Should I turn it down?
[62:48.23]It's air hockey.
[62:49.19]Yeah, why did I not say air hockey?
[62:57.06]It's a game where you shuffle... It's air hockey.
[63:05.88]As you can tell, it's pretty hard.
[63:07.66]It's running at like... My game is running at like 20 frames a second.
[63:12.91]His game is running at like 60 frames a second.
[63:16.23]It's not fair.
[63:17.05]This is what happens when a PC player plays a console player.
[63:20.75]This is why the cross-platform don't work.
[63:25.39]Alright, hold on.
[63:38.34]I'm going to try something tactic here.
[63:39.70]I'm going to try to go into the top right corner every time.
[63:41.60]Uh oh.
[63:47.29]Oh my god, look, he's lining up a shot.
[63:51.77]Fuck.
[63:54.31]It's not as easy as it looks.
[64:03.80]Look at the frames!
[64:04.82]Come on!
[64:05.40]Like, give me a break!
[64:06.04]It's not frame perfect like you think it is!
[64:12.25]Go back to do- No!
[64:13.73]This is not one of the hard ones.
[64:15.39]Hold on, I'm just gonna- I think the pig is hard.
[64:24.50]How many points does it take for me to get embarrassed, I wonder?
[64:26.68]Okay, hold on.
[64:38.40]Oh.
[64:41.19]I'm using that technique.
[64:42.77]If I have, like, 10 frames a second, then I can fill the whole board with a giant paddle.
[64:59.49]Why are we playing to 15?
[65:04.98]We shouldn't be playing to 15.
[65:06.00]That's what makes no sense.
[65:19.92]I know it's... Just let it fall in.
[65:24.02]Just do it.
[65:24.38]Just get it.
[65:24.90]Do it.
[65:25.92]Do it.
[65:26.40]I'm gonna play the easy one.
[65:32.42]Man, this game was so much fun, though.
[65:33.96]It read at so much better frame rate in my brain when I played it.
[65:37.38]I played this on an original Mac.
[65:38.96]Alright, I lost.
[65:48.50]Game.
[65:48.98]Wait.
[65:52.42]Define keys.
[65:53.87]Champions.
[65:56.01]Biff Raunch is 15 and 14.
[65:58.39]Okay.
[65:58.79]Paddle.
[66:23.53]No, I can't lose.
[66:26.01]Somebody said, go, okay.
[66:33.18]I don't think this is regulation.
[66:36.20]He's got a chalkboard eraser, and I have an entire lane of bowling bumpers.
[66:57.54]See?
[66:57.80]He's easy, though.
[66:59.10]Look at this.
[67:05.53]Watch how slow... I'm just gonna show you.
[67:06.77]Watch how slow he does this.
[67:08.49]See?
[67:09.57]That... The pig was hard.
[67:10.49]It was a hard one.
[67:12.13]Alright, I can drop the... Alright, I'm gonna put it down to a smaller... Look at that.
[67:16.63]That's so much easier.
[67:17.29]Alright, hold on.
[67:18.53]How do I...
[67:21.74]Can I, like... There we go.
[67:24.40]Alright.
[67:24.88]Paddle size.
[67:26.61]Let's put it back to normal.
[67:29.05]Is it 20?
[67:31.13]Alright.
[67:31.81]I will beat you.
[67:34.35]Blocker.
[67:36.35]No blocker.
[67:36.87]Small blocker.
[67:37.59]Custom blocker.
[67:38.47]Whatever that means.
[67:39.18]Alright, here we go.
[67:40.76]Alright, let's go.
[67:44.04]Yeah.
[67:44.48]He's absolutely stupid.
[67:45.60]Like, I will win no matter what.
[67:49.24]I have to give myself a... No.
[67:53.36]Look it.
[67:53.68]See?
[67:54.88]I went right to the hardest thing in the game.
[67:58.58]That was my problem.
[68:00.86]Make it one or you're a fake gamer.
[68:04.67]I don't think you can even do that.
[68:16.83]I'm gonna win.
[68:17.47]This is embarrassing.
[68:22.65]No, new opponent.
[68:23.49]This is just... This is a hustle?
[68:32.30]No, it's not.
[68:36.62]Chalk Eraser versus a piece of chalk.
[68:42.30]I wonder if I do it really hard if it'll break through his hologram shield.
[68:49.22]Do it.
[68:54.02]You're going to make him cry.
[68:56.82]Now, new opponent.
[68:58.32]This is embarrassing for you.
[68:59.70]I don't want to just have you lose by this much.
[69:03.39]Let's go back to 20.
[69:06.39]And new opponent.
[69:08.17]I think the robot is the hardest thing in the whole game.
[69:11.84]I think the robot is actually impossible.
[69:19.10]So let's see.
[69:25.09]Why was the pig so hard?
[69:26.27]The robot is always the hardest one.
[69:31.00]This guy's the champion?
[69:35.00]Did I do something?
[69:35.96]Did I change a setting?
[69:37.96]Why was the pig so unbearable but the robot's not?
[69:41.20]I swear I have this memory of it being like around the edges.
[69:54.37]I must have fucked something up.
[69:59.43]You just sucked when you last played.
[70:00.99]No, no way.
[70:02.09]No way.
[70:02.77]New opponent.
[70:03.32]Look.
[70:06.82]There he is.
[70:09.66]I didn't just suck when I last played.
[70:13.72]I'm sorry, guys.
[70:14.34]That's not the case.
[70:23.36]His cursor is actually teleporting.
[70:28.96]Let's see if I can beat him, though.
[70:29.90]I'll try.
[70:30.20]Jesus.
[70:32.34]Ooh, it's going to be close.
[70:41.99]I'll do it.
[70:42.33]I can do it.
[70:48.29]Ugh.
[70:50.95]Boomer versus a zoomer.
[71:01.26]I'm an idiot.
[71:06.21]Why does everybody have to be a boomer and everybody have to be a zoomer?
[71:14.47]And I don't even know which one is who in that scenario.
[71:27.54]Why is it always going to be about boomer?
[71:36.72]Seriously, don't ask me how actual 12-year-old me was able to do this.
[71:46.55]Nice.
[71:46.89]Alright, I got the advantage.
[71:49.25]This is the champion, right?
[71:55.80]Ugh.
[71:57.80]It's because you probably used a bigger paddle.
[71:59.42]You know, I probably did.
[72:08.75]I'm trying to sneak it into the corner.
[72:11.19]I'm still looking.
[72:11.75]Alright, I'm gonna wait till his curse is on the left and then go.
[72:31.54]I'm trying to do the tennis strategy.
[72:32.92]It's not really working.
[72:42.14]Good.
[72:45.57]He doesn't know about the second form.
[72:48.67]They don't evolve.
[72:50.89]I say, that's what happens when I look over at chat.
[72:53.21]If I was in a tournament and we were about to start, I wouldn't look over at the audience and go, what did somebody just say?
[72:58.88]No, I would play.
[72:59.80]Let's go.
[73:05.55]No professional athlete in the world, like a baseball player, doesn't get up to the batter's box with the bat in his hand, step into the plate, and right before the pitcher starts to pitch, turns around and, like, asks a question to the fucking people in the stands behind him.
[73:20.12]No.
[73:20.54]He just focuses and he plays the damn game.
[73:34.95]Good.
[73:53.90]I'm imagining a baseball player just standing in the batter's box.
[73:58.85]And he's responding to somebody that's behind him, calling him bald.
[74:10.83]It looks like Jay Elbertson at the plate here.
[74:15.49]It seems to be arguing with somebody behind home plate.
[74:18.37]The home plate face.
[74:20.09]That was a ball.
[74:21.57]It looks like they're screaming.
[74:22.71]He's pointing at his head saying, I'm not.
[74:25.21]I'm not.
[74:25.71]I'm not sure what he's talking about here, Frank.
[74:27.16]What does that mean?
[74:29.04]No, he took the helmet off.
[74:30.12]He took the helmet off.
[74:30.76]He's pointing at his hair.
[74:32.50]He's getting loud now.
[74:33.78]He's been ejected from the game.
[74:38.44]This is the only fucking platform where this happens.
[74:55.02]Alright, I got some more.
[74:57.40]What about a comedy show?
[74:59.77]Yeah, but you're not like a professional comedy athlete.
[75:06.11]A comedian doesn't go on stage and open up Shufflepuck and play it with his back to the audience.
[75:16.30]Alright, I can still do it.
[75:32.85]Come on.
[75:34.37]Three more.
[75:36.35]Well, why wouldn't you?
[75:37.17]I don't know.
[75:37.79]I'm not supposed to be looking over here.
[75:49.22]Alright.
[75:50.56]Tied it up.
[75:52.26]Two more, and I beat this guy.
[76:12.17]One more.
[76:18.15]Here we go.
[76:23.51]Give me the ball, give me the puck.
[76:25.04]Give me the puck.
[76:34.04]You lose!
[76:36.70]Hey, and take those shoulders back to Alderman.
[76:39.52]You fucking idiot.
[76:44.61]Who's next?
[76:53.47]I think this is the hard one.
[77:01.97]This guy's only playing with one hand.
[77:07.58]He's like, drinking.
[77:20.24]So am I, but I'm drinking coffee.
[77:21.66]That's the difference.
[77:22.16]I can do it.
[77:27.98]Who plays air hockey with two hands?
[77:31.45]Um... Oh yeah.
[77:43.97]It's not a Ouija board.
[77:51.84]So who's the hardest person in here?
[77:57.33]It's definitely not you.
[77:58.23]You don't have enough power.
[77:59.03]Alright, that was... I had an insane amount of spin on that.
[78:09.02]Look at this.
[78:11.04]He's all defense.
[78:11.70]He has no offense.
[78:25.95]I'm just gonna walk away from the table.
[78:29.04]Uh, what about who's under here?
[78:31.32]Ooh.
[78:32.68]He put his hand up.
[78:42.45]Yeah, you're real bad.
[78:44.47]Not even up to a challenge.
[78:53.45]It's not even worth my time.
[78:55.11]It's not.
[78:55.61]I'm sorry.
[78:56.07]Hey, thanks for playing.
[79:00.54]I'm way, way higher on the tier list than you.
[79:05.40]But I could make you feel happy.
[79:06.44]You want me to make you feel better?
[79:07.99]Oops.
[79:08.49]Okay, there you go.
[79:12.03]You got a point.
[79:13.99]Good work.
[79:15.43]Yeah.
[79:35.18]Do not Disney movie me.
[79:36.82]I'm not going to let that happen.
[79:37.74]I'm out.
[79:48.34]Here we go.
[79:55.69]Is her paddle smaller?
[79:57.73]Why does she have a smaller paddle?
[80:03.19]What the hell was that?
[80:06.13]Uh, so that's cheating.
[80:07.44]So you cheated.
[80:08.94]I don't get to do that.
[80:27.83]Okay.
[80:32.39]That's an automatic disqualification.
[80:40.08]The robot gets harder when you beat him enough.
[80:43.84]I know there's one character in this game that... No, I'm out of here.
[80:55.37]You have magic powers.
[80:56.91]That's really cool, actually.
[80:57.91]That's really cool.
[80:58.93]Anybody in the back?
[81:00.65]What about... What is that?
[81:02.59]What about this little guy?
[81:09.84]Is this the guy?
[81:11.86]Is this the little Yoda guy that's impossible?
[81:18.40]This is me.
[81:19.85]This is me.
[81:23.45]I did the same thing.
[81:24.41]This is me.
[81:26.38]That's weird.
[81:28.64]I did this like fucking 25 minutes ago.
[81:36.10]Same tactic.
[81:52.95]I can't fucking believe it.
[81:58.08]And he's gonna lose with one point.
[82:03.82]That's unbelievable.
[82:13.39]Alright, here's the last character.
[82:19.60]Who's this?
[82:23.08]Uh, looks like a beer?
[82:26.90]Alright, well, I didn't know you were gonna do that.
[82:31.72]Sorry, I beat the hardest, I beat the one that, I beat the champion.
[82:37.29]Maybe not.
[82:41.63]He does this little wind-up.
[82:45.25]Oh man, this is bad.
[83:03.56]Awww.
[83:04.20]Is this Biff?
[83:17.23]I gotta score at least one point on Biff.
[83:22.91]Right in the corner.
[83:27.57]I might be able to do it.
[83:29.36]It's really possible.
[83:43.17]That was so fast, you can't even see it.
[84:06.47]Ah!
[84:07.47]Shit!
[84:18.27]If that technique doesn't work, stop doing it.
[84:19.87]Oh, I'm gonna lose.
[84:33.92]I'm just realizing that there's not very much safety here.
[84:36.22]Imagine playing air hockey with somebody without the barrier in front of you.
[84:44.88]You would get so hurt.
[84:47.95]I actually broke my finger before playing air hockey when I was younger.
[84:52.51]I had those friends, and you know, some of you guys have them, because when you play air hockey, there's this unwritten agreement that you're not going to fucking murder each other.
[85:01.28]Nobody wants to go as hard as they can.
[85:03.40]Crack, crack, crack!
[85:05.20]You have an unwritten rule that you're just going to play, and no one's going to really go as hard as they can.
[85:09.43]See, my friends didn't do that.
[85:11.09]Friends of mine would try to go as hard as they can, and what would end up happening is it would hit the sides and bounce up.
[85:18.63]And it was not cool.
[85:19.83]And sometimes they would do it too hard.
[85:22.09]And it would hit the sides.
[85:23.05]Bounce up and like... Kind of like go by.
[85:25.51]And you'd be like, stop that bullshit.
[85:29.35]Stop that.
[85:31.77]Well, one of those times it bounced up.
[85:34.21]Caught me right in the finger.
[85:36.29]And then we all got grounded.
[85:40.66]Why did I get grounded?
[85:41.42]I had nothing to do with it.
[85:53.98]Fuck, he's gonna embarrass me.
[86:01.62]Did this happen last week?
[86:02.66]No, it happened when I was like 14.
[86:04.44]They need to make these things out of like a squishy material nowadays.
[86:14.87]Do they still make these things out of hard plastic?
[86:22.14]You know how many times I've been in an arcade and you just hear... You look behind you and that thing is on its edge rolling down.
[86:30.90]It's like, easy, guys.
[86:44.35]Oh, you should have to wear like a big heavy glove.
[86:47.41]Yeah.
[86:47.55]Yeah.
[86:49.25]Before you play this game, you should have to put on... It will not activate unless you put on this big heavy fucking gauntlet.
[86:55.05]That's like... Like 20 pounds.
[86:57.78]So you can't do it hard.
[86:59.06]I think I saw all the opponents, right?
[87:07.40]Yeah, this guy's the hardest.
[87:15.05]I think we saw everybody.
[87:18.29]Unless there's somebody down here?
[87:20.77]No, this is just martini guy.
[87:25.35]Play the robot.
[87:27.09]You want us to beat the robot badly and see what he does?
[87:32.92]Robot, robot.
[87:34.88]Alright, I'll beat the robot and then... Look, he's very easy.
[87:46.12]There's a droid setting.
[87:55.09]Anybody else do this when you play air hockey with somebody?
[87:59.21]I don't like air hockey.
[88:00.33]I don't, because it's a lot of money.
[88:02.85]Usually it's like a dollar fifty.
[88:05.53]It's usually one to two dollars to play it.
[88:07.99]And usually the other person is way more excited to play than you are.
[88:12.15]And you have to deal with, instead of, oh, I really want to go play Time Crisis, that sounds like a lot of fun.
[88:16.87]No, you have to block out the next like 30 straight minutes to pretend to enjoy playing air hockey.
[88:24.35]You can't leave the table.
[88:25.77]It's just somebody... Oh, you know, you scored one, and I scored one.
[88:28.87]And then, oh, you missed.
[88:30.45]Oh, wait, this is nice.
[88:32.17]Nice, like, volley we've got going here.
[88:34.80]It lasts for, like, 20 to 30 minutes.
[88:38.40]And the table keeps producing air out of the holes until somebody wins.
[88:42.88]So you can't just leave.
[88:45.90]Nobody wants to take over your game for you because they want to do their own.
[88:51.36]But usually there's one just dominant person that's the one that they want to play.
[88:56.73]They're that... I want to... Let's do air hockey.
[88:59.05]Yeah!
[89:00.79]You just don't give a shit.
[89:02.65]Now, I've been the air hockey enthusiast before.
[89:13.42]But there's never really a time when both people are incredibly enthusiastic about it.
[89:22.54]Sometimes, it's even both are very not enthusiastic about it.
[89:25.58]You walk around the arcade four times.
[89:28.82]Oh, you even play air hockey, I guess?
[89:32.04]And then you both lazily play it.
[89:35.56]And neither one of you has any fun.
[89:50.10]I have fun.
[89:54.69]Maybe you shouldn't go to the arcade.
[90:06.04]We had an air hockey table when I was a kid, but friends of mine did the exact thing you're describing.
[90:11.46]And I was afraid to play it because I didn't want to break my finger.
[90:15.50]Yeah!
[90:23.17]Something else, too.
[90:23.99]I'll tell you another thing.
[90:26.25]I don't like the loud noises it makes.
[90:28.43]Am I weird?
[90:31.05]Anytime somebody gets into back, back, back, back, back, back, it's like, I don't like it.
[90:36.54]It's really fucking loud, and it's freaking me out.
[90:41.12]When you see your friend queue up for a big hit, and you're like, don't do it, please, don't do it, please, and they go, boom!
[90:47.12]It's like, ugh, I don't want that.
[90:50.90]Alright, so let's do it again.
[90:54.61]Droid.
[90:55.49]Oh.
[91:05.05]Oh, no.
[91:05.55]I'm turning... I'm turning him into that friend.
[91:23.60]This is gonna... This might crash my computer.
[91:28.10]Speed.
[91:28.60]I'm gonna break my finger.
[91:35.88]Alright.
[91:36.42]Serve?
[91:38.48]I'm gonna sneeze.
[91:39.02]I'm really sorry.
[91:40.99]I'm fine.
[91:49.55]Okay.
[91:50.89]Let's go.
[91:54.35]Uh, new game.
[91:59.50]Did I make it unbeatable?
[92:11.95]I didn't make it unbeatable.
[92:13.09]I can do this.
[92:21.01]It's not unbeatable.
[92:22.33]If I score one point... If I score one point, I deserve an apology.
[92:36.28]He bounces off the edges way too fast from his serve.
[92:46.47]Remember I told you Winnie the Pooh home run derby?
[92:49.99]That's why I said that.
[92:54.82]Make my paddle 80.
[92:55.84]No, I can't.
[92:57.52]I gotta do it legit.
[92:58.32]What was that little pause?
[93:03.12]I don't think I'll ever score.
[93:20.50]He's at 200.
[93:26.60]No apologies.
[93:27.34]That's alright.
[93:28.80]That's okay.
[93:29.44]I'm not gonna move.
[93:40.80]I have to apologize to you.
[93:43.06]Yeah, okay.
[93:45.54]That's fair.
[93:50.28]I thought I had it right there.
[94:11.79]I'm sorry.
[94:13.05]I'm sorry, guys.
[94:13.46]It's my fault.
[94:20.63]And that is Shufflepuck.
[94:26.51]The weird part about Shufflepuck is I've... I used to sit here for hours and play this.
[94:31.01]And I've kind of done everything you can do in this game... in 25 minutes.
[94:42.89]Wait a minute!
[94:45.29]Hold on, this is... Death is here!
[94:50.74]Secret character.
[94:55.02]What?
[94:57.56]Was that somebody under the robe?
[95:07.49]Eat that.
[95:13.82]Do max paddle?
[95:14.76]No, I don't think I need that.
[95:18.16]Ahhhh.
[95:20.19]No, it's not death.
[95:21.09]It's just some kids doing the trench coat trick.
[95:31.12]To get into the bar.
[95:32.78]Because they're not 21.
[95:41.31]I got one point.
[95:41.89]That's all I care about.
[95:46.77]Let me get one more point.
[95:48.27]Last one.
[95:49.57]No, I quit.
[95:52.23]Lost to kids?
[95:52.77]No, I'm sorry, rephrase that.
[95:54.21]Lost to three kids.
[96:11.96]Alright, that's it.
[96:13.54]Let's do the next one.
[96:16.53]I knew I wanted to play this, and I knew I wanted to play Donald Duck.
[96:19.13]I have one or two more that I thought were interesting.
[96:23.09]Which is it?
[96:26.33]Yeah, I know I already leaked them.
[96:28.37]I leaked them out already.
[96:31.31]Because you saw the top of the browser.
[96:33.25]Dino Park Tycoon is the next one.
[96:36.11]It's already been leaked.
[96:42.17]Can we vote on the games?
[96:42.99]Yes.
[96:43.55]But I wanted to do these first.
[96:45.25]Because they look the most interesting to me.
[96:46.93]Because I saw them pop up randomly.
[96:49.60]So I wanted to try them.
[96:50.22]This is Dino Park Tycoon.
[96:52.85]Tycoon.
[96:57.73]It's very possible that I may or may not sit here for another four hours.
[97:01.88]I don't know.
[97:09.36]Okay, new game.
[97:12.26]The bank has approved a business loan of $5,000.
[97:16.09]Payments will be made monthly.
[97:17.37]Remember that you have to buy land, fencing, dinosaurs, and food.
[97:21.23]Good luck on your venture.
[97:24.21]Thank you.
[97:27.27]Buy land at the real estate office.
[97:31.95]Dino Diner?
[97:33.13]Dino City Big Big Sale.
[97:35.26]Wait, they're... Dinosaurs are people.
[97:40.22]But they also put people in the parks.
[97:42.66]Is that what I'm understanding here?
[97:48.60]So, that's weird.
[97:50.74]Okay, let's go buy real estate.
[97:56.27]Uh, VA, HA, FHA approved.
[98:00.08]Okay, so we can do the desert, plains, or the marsh.
[98:04.04]Peaceful and remote, dry, hot, and flat.
[98:08.18]500 bucks an acre.
[98:09.76]The plains is mild weather, fertile land, close to towns, $1,000 per acre.
[98:16.60]Or the marsh.
[98:17.22]Wet, swampy, plants and reptiles really love it.
[98:20.30]I think I have to do desert.
[98:21.26]This is the first try.
[98:27.34]That's cute.
[98:28.48]What a cute game.
[98:29.28]Alright.
[98:30.40]So, buy.
[98:35.04]Select a plot of land to purchase.
[98:37.45]Front gate is here.
[98:40.23]Public restrooms.
[98:42.27]Office food?
[98:45.89]Foods.
[98:47.05]This one?
[98:49.43]Sold.
[98:52.79]How much money should I spend?
[98:54.72]Food?
[98:54.86]Food?
[99:01.65]Alright.
[99:03.51]All of it?
[99:03.93]No, I only have four grand.
[99:04.92]I'm not gonna buy it all.
[99:09.42]This is good, for now.
[99:11.78]What about one place in the office?
[99:13.54]Alright, I'm gonna do one office.
[99:16.38]Restrooms are included, aren't they?
[99:17.44]Alright, that's good.
[99:20.56]Okay, I got food, one extra little part of the park, and then an office space here.
[99:29.87]The other money I can spend on dinosaurs.
[99:34.93]By fencing at the general store.
[99:39.88]Order form.
[99:40.40]Alright.
[99:40.98]You can find it all in the general store catalog.
[99:43.60]Fences.
[99:45.46]Wood.
[99:47.50]Thousand dollars a pen.
[99:48.80]Cement wall or electricity.
[99:53.97]This wood fence?
[99:55.15]Wood keeps in dinosaurs?
[100:02.51]Which one's the cheapest?
[100:03.29]Let's do wood.
[100:09.27]Oh, shit.
[100:10.82]Okay.
[100:11.72]I'm gonna put it over here.
[100:12.48]Should I do it on all of them?
[100:21.82]Do I need a fence around the office?
[100:23.66]I don't need a fence around the office.
[100:33.65]That's gonna be fine.
[100:34.25]Alright, that's done.
[100:42.23]Hire an employee here.
[100:44.00]I'm almost out of money.
[100:44.70]1400 bucks a month.
[100:52.44]I don't have any... I have no money.
[100:57.42]Maintenance.
[100:59.02]Concessions.
[100:59.76]Security.
[101:01.12]Tour guide.
[101:01.93]Management.
[101:05.23]Maintenance?
[101:07.95]Uh... Did he just put that in his nose?
[101:14.09]Maintenance.
[101:15.97]Holy shit, he's ripping off his nose.
[101:17.79]That's a fake nose.
[101:21.86]His real nose is underneath.
[101:22.84]I don't know why.
[101:23.44]Why does he want to make his nose bigger?
[101:25.08]Uh, I... I'm not gonna be able to afford a dinosaur.
[101:47.43]Don't hire anybody.
[101:48.37]Hold on.
[101:49.75]One maintenance worker.
[101:50.71]I'm going to need it.
[101:51.89]Buy a dinosaur at Dino City.
[101:59.05]Albertosaurus.
[102:01.63]Ankylosaurus.
[102:03.51]Coliphysis.
[102:05.87]Dino-niches.
[102:08.01]Edmontosaurus.
[102:11.29]Allosaurus.
[102:13.85]Corythosaurus.
[102:15.03]These are too expensive.
[102:17.57]Um... I can only afford a Coliphesus or a Dionysus.
[102:24.84]Dionycus.
[102:28.08]Dionysus.
[102:39.25]Colophysis?
[102:40.01]Alright, let's do a... Dino... Is it Dino-nichus?
[102:49.25]Dino-nichus?
[102:51.11]Dino-nichus?
[102:55.47]Alright, I'm gonna do... Dino.
[102:59.01]Get it.
[102:59.51]Buy it.
[103:05.74]What do I do with the egg?
[103:06.46]I have 200... It already hatched.
[103:07.92]Okay.
[103:10.24]Oh, okay.
[103:10.92]Put it over here.
[103:12.56]One dino.
[103:14.22]Cool.
[103:16.92]Now what do I do?
[103:20.55]Buy food for the dinosaur.
[103:27.55]What does he eat?
[103:28.21]I don't know what this dinosaur eats.
[103:31.01]Somebody look it up.
[103:32.71]Type in, is a Dionychus a herbivore?
[103:41.19]Is it meat?
[103:45.19]$25 a unit.
[103:48.48]Get out of here.
[103:49.08]All right, nobody move.
[104:03.63]Small feeder.
[104:06.01]I guess I'm just... Let's do... Two, three, four units?
[104:11.53]How much is too much?
[104:15.24]Set an admission... Oh, here we go.
[104:16.52]Let's make the money back.
[104:17.24]Admission prices.
[104:19.86]Businesses bought and sold.
[104:22.30]Tickets.
[104:24.18]Nobody is coming to the park.
[104:25.22]Uh... What?
[104:28.89]What?
[104:30.92]General ledger, inventory, visits, food, gifts, staff, profit, loss.
[104:37.60]How do I do this?
[104:40.94]Check profit statement.
[104:42.07]Where's like a guide bank?
[104:46.97]Current balance.
[104:52.71]Snacks?
[104:53.81]So I can't set these?
[104:59.98]Am I missing something here?
[105:00.86]It's at the price of the park.
[105:05.93]You have one dino and two unused pens.
[105:10.13]Yeah, tickets, but it says nobody is coming to the park.
[105:15.45]No, I don't want to sell the park.
[105:17.61]You have no concessions to sell food.
[105:29.63]Get a loan.
[105:35.91]Uh... Did I do it?
[105:42.85]Dino diner?
[105:44.17]Land.
[105:45.46]General store employment.
[105:50.30]Staff okay.
[105:51.38]Some more tour guides might be nice.
[105:55.28]You have four units of meat.
[106:00.22]How do I set the park?
[106:04.44]Is it just free?
[106:07.02]Set admission prices in here.
[106:13.58]Visits?
[106:15.32]Oh, okay, hold on.
[106:15.94]Ticket prices.
[106:18.84]For winter, that's fine.
[106:21.70]Spring, it's going to be more.
[106:23.04]Summer, way more.
[106:25.75]Fall, it's going to be four.
[106:27.55]This is prime season here.
[106:31.89]Alright, that looks good.
[106:39.21]Select the park icon to start.
[106:40.67]I'm ready to go.
[106:46.22]Here we go.
[106:50.52]Is that the dinosaur?
[106:56.40]Why is he doing a fighting game entrance?
[107:00.41]Meat?
[107:00.65]He does one unit of meat a week.
[107:02.25]Oh, I'm making money rapidly.
[107:21.87]Alright, where's the other pens?
[107:25.57]This place sucks.
[107:28.57]This place is terrible.
[107:29.75]There's a dug hole with water poured in it.
[107:31.99]There's one dinosaur and there's no paths.
[107:46.02]I like the song though.
[107:48.40]Alright, let me get another dinosaur.
[107:53.42]Cops are here. 4,000?
[107:59.63]Alright.
[108:00.59]Buy food for the dinosaur.
[108:01.61]How many days has it been?
[108:03.29]No, I want another dinosaur.
[108:07.94]I want an expensive one.
[108:08.86]A nice one.
[108:11.50]There's more.
[108:13.92]Where's the T-Rex?
[108:15.28]T-Rex, $97.50.
[108:16.16]That's what I want.
[108:19.33]I will wait until then.
[108:21.49]I need a tour guide.
[108:23.35]Your dinosaur is going hungry.
[108:24.57]Buy food.
[108:25.11]What?
[108:25.23]What?
[108:30.82]Just get the shit out of me.
[108:32.72]Should I do a medium unit?
[108:40.86]Okay.
[108:42.38]I need a tour guide.
[108:49.55]Tour guide, 900 bucks a month.
[108:52.81]That's right, okay.
[108:55.63]The tour guide for my one dinosaur in my pool.
[109:00.23]Alright, I'm watching, let me get a T-Rex in here.
[109:09.31]Is he getting bigger?
[109:19.76]I just hired that person 900 bucks a month to just be standing here pointing this way.
[109:27.63]Which effectively a wooden sign could do.
[109:32.77]A wooden sign that says Dinosaurus with a blurb about what the Dinosaurus is.
[109:39.22]Could be right here with the arrow pointing that way.
[109:44.74]End of winter quarter.
[109:49.11]Why am I losing money?
[109:52.19]Oh, right, right, right.
[109:58.01]Auction today?
[110:00.47]For what?
[110:03.15]Next up, we have an Angliosaurus.
[110:05.73]Can we have a starting bid at $3,000?
[110:06.77]We got $3,000 from the guy with the straw hat.
[110:10.35]Can I get $3,100?
[110:10.67]$3,300.
[110:10.69]Is that a good look it up?

[134:51.30]I think it's going fine.
[134:52.96]I'm gonna need another dinosaur though.
[134:54.88]A big one.
[134:55.90]One that can pull in big numbers.
[134:56.98]Are we doing up food?
[135:10.61]I'm gonna get a T-Rex next.
[135:11.65]I'm already out of fucking food again.
[135:37.36]All right.
[135:39.70]Let me go to real estate for a second.
[135:45.91]So we've got one here, spot up there, spot up here.
[135:51.70]What do I got?
[135:52.86]5,900?
[135:53.58]How much is a T-Rex?
[135:59.03]I did it.
[135:59.31]Okay.
[135:59.83]Now I'm gonna save money until I can afford a T-Rex.
[136:06.39]I'm firing somebody, too.
[136:19.10]I'm bleeding money, I think.
[136:21.63]Fire the tour guide.
[136:22.77]No, I think the tour guide is necessary.
[136:24.21]Should I make the prices cheaper?
[136:25.35]Or should I make them more expensive?
[136:28.76]Cheaper?
[136:29.08]To get more people?
[136:34.32]Why can I not set the prices?
[136:41.89]Do I have to set the prices per year?
[136:50.78]I don't get to change my prices.
[137:01.09]Everything's fine.
[137:03.39]49.
[137:11.28]Cheap winter tickets and expensive summer tickets.
[137:13.36]Yeah, that's what my theory was before, too.
[137:23.12]This would be an 8 out of 10 stream.
[137:25.02]But that fly is making it a 6 out of 10.
[137:27.26]Get the fuck out of here.
[137:35.35]Your annual income tax for the park was $333.
[137:37.89]You're gonna tax me?
[137:41.35]End of the year.
[137:41.89]Make any changes for first quarter now.
[137:43.93]Clock has stopped and will resume when you leave the office.
[137:48.26]Here we go.
[137:51.22]So, let's make the ticket price in the winter $4, spring $5, summer $6, fall $5.
[137:55.99]$6.50.
[137:56.13]How's that?
[137:56.73]I can't make it that cheap.
[137:59.45]$7 for summer?
[137:59.77]That's kind of high.
[138:16.09]three no 350 450 seven five six fifty and five same thing with food let's go it looks fine right staff 52 per month all right that seems pretty good with my bank loan okay current balance is

[164:55.70]Okay.
[164:58.80]It's so unfair.
[165:00.08]Remap.
[165:00.70]Okay.
[165:08.03]CPU dumb is thinking.
[165:12.09]Doesn't have any words.
[165:12.95]Okay.
[165:25.54]I'm done.
[165:25.88]I don't want to play this anymore.
[165:30.66]The timer.
[165:44.82]Other options.
[165:47.78]Edit.
[165:48.72]No two letter words.
[165:50.15]No S words.
[165:52.53]With swear words?
[166:00.93]No S words.
[166:03.61]Special.
[166:07.77]Alright, let's turn off no S words.
[166:11.23]Let's see what that does.
[166:14.71]So then, let's write shit.
[166:22.36]Alright, we got... E...
[166:39.19]Tiffany I Need another okay, I need an F. I need an F. Is there an F somewhere?
[166:51.56]Oh My god, it has to be an F somewhere, right?
[166:54.86]Where's Tiffany?
[166:59.59]The blank can be anything, but I need... Alright, is there... I can't go, like... Tiffany.
[167:08.71]Can I go up?
[167:13.31]Okay, you can do nifty.
[167:38.06]Holy shit.
[167:43.84]I can go up.
[167:44.70]That's 48 points.
[167:45.28]What do you mean it doesn't work like that?
[167:53.56]It's Tiffany.
[168:06.16]This isn't... somebody said this isn't Japanese.
[168:10.98]Like, what?
[168:12.16]What?
[168:13.10]Don't... they don't... what are you talking about?
[168:22.97]I don't even know what that means.
[168:24.41]I don't read up.
[168:32.88]Who reads up?
[168:35.41]I just didn't know the rules and why does it have 48 points then?
[168:40.82]bottom to top just go with nifty oh my fucking stomach hurts
[169:09.93]That's only going to give me 36 points.
[169:12.77]If I do the upside down Tiffany, it's 48.
[169:28.16]Affinity?
[169:28.84]Good thing we have a timer.
[169:35.82]No, it doesn't fit.
[169:50.83]How is that less than the upside-down Tiffany?
[169:56.07]Do you understand?
[169:56.87]I'm doing it.
[170:08.04]T-I-F... T-I-F...
[170:16.74]T-I-F.

[170:29.26]Lock it in.
[170:29.80]I added it to the dictionary.
[170:46.58]Hurry up, let's go CPU 1.
[170:53.03]Ugh.
[170:55.77]In.
[170:57.09]You're supposed to be a 9 CPU level.
[171:00.09]CPU Dumb wrote... Ugh.
[171:02.29]Oh yeah?
[171:13.94]Oh.

[171:52.14]Ah, that's a word.
[172:00.39]What do you mean, the word empty?
[172:07.17]Yeah, it is.
[172:25.62]217 points.
[172:25.94]Let's go.
[172:30.87]You can literally add anything.
[172:33.01]A. A. Chad.
[172:39.21]Car.
[172:39.87]You can do better than that.
[172:40.67]Your time is up.
[172:41.59]No, it's not.
[172:53.80]Okay.
[172:56.39]We're gonna do veg.
[173:00.71]This is like a super word score, right?
[173:04.77]I was hoping I could get like a T. I would do like Vegeta.
[173:12.32]Fuckin' stupid timer!
[173:20.14]I could do like, instead of Vegeta, it could be like VEGIVA or like VEGOVA.
[173:31.29]Oh my god the timer!
[173:37.16]I have to get out of this
[173:58.82]Rude.
[173:59.54]Alright, turn the timer off now, please.
[174:05.23]My favorite Dragon Ball Z character.
[174:10.04]Vijuva.
[174:12.08]Vigoova.
[174:15.80]Oh, but what's his power level?
[174:17.20]Vigoova?
[174:29.41]I'm the guy that you play... Listen, you're playing Scrabble with somebody that is shit-faced.
[174:42.73]And they're too drunk for you to explain that what they're doing is stupid or wrong.
[174:49.01]You just gotta have to let them do it.
[174:51.15]Like, I'm the guy that you're playing Scrabble with somebody that is shit-faced.
[174:55.71]Oh, Vegeta?
[174:56.83]Yeah, Vegeta.
[174:58.88]Oh, yeah, okay, dude, whatever.
[175:00.38]Like, you should probably slow down.
[175:01.72]This is all fucked up.
[175:15.35]I don't even know what any of this is.
[175:21.07]I'm currently losing, so...
[175:27.39]What has the most points?
[175:37.02]Where did that letter just go?
[175:37.86]Where did the letter go?
[175:40.26]And why can I not pick it up?
[175:49.96]You.
[175:51.45]You, Tiffany.
[175:52.87]You, Tiffany.
[175:56.35]Oh yeah, that's Tiffany, you're right, you're right.
[175:58.81]Yeah, you Tiffany.
[176:00.77]Yeah, that's her name.
[176:03.87]That's not a word, but... Yeah, you Tiffany.
[176:12.37]I Tiffany.
[176:13.51]You Tiffany.
[176:14.85]I Tiffany.
[176:18.99]Whatever you were drinking tonight, man, I would highly recommend you don't anymore.
[176:29.86]CPU-1 is going to pass.
[176:30.98]I don't care.
[176:56.11]VEGUVAL.
[176:59.56]Me wins with 343 points.
[177:01.83]That was fun.
[177:12.43]Me.
[177:14.24]And that will lead us into our first break of the night.
[177:17.46]I'll be right back.
[177:23.66]I'll see you guys in a small moment.
[177:28.25]Be right back.
[182:39.71]Shall we continue?
[182:40.41]I think we shall.
[182:42.29]Let's move over here.
[183:01.18]Back to the list.
[183:05.11]We are going to do another one or two here.
[183:15.19]Click on the screen if you'd like.
[183:25.61]Dungeons of Death.
[183:28.41]Super Carts.
[183:30.49]Not playing Scrabble again.
[183:32.98]Mickey Jigsaw Puzzles.
[183:36.46]Could be kind of fun.
[183:41.46]Codename Ice.
[183:51.13]We need more Disney.
[183:52.41]More Donald.
[183:55.19]Okay.
[183:57.05]Dungeons of Death it is.
[183:59.61]Thank you for voting.
[184:02.86]Let's check it out.
[184:11.70]Is it gonna load?
[184:12.52]Come on.
[184:18.10]Loading Dungeon of Death.
[184:20.53]There it is.
[184:24.26]Loading images.
[184:28.80]Someone said this sounds way cooler than it probably is.
[184:33.26]Start a new challenge.
[184:37.57]I guess we'll do the introduction.
[184:39.85]The kingdom is in need of a new king.
[184:41.33]There are no more descendants to the throne.
[184:44.27]The king has decided to issue a challenge.
[184:46.27]The first person to survive the dungeon will become the new king.
[184:51.49]Rescue the crown from the dungeon of death and become king or die in the process.
[184:56.59]Make your way down to the bottom of the dungeon, find the portal door, and teleport into the throne room.
[185:03.33]Alright.
[185:06.15]Starting the challenge.
[185:07.89]And to the number of dungeon levels, 6 to 12.
[185:10.31]Let's just go with like 8.
[185:16.35]Item to purchase food, healing potion, extreme healing potion.
[185:21.65]How much money do I have?
[185:22.37]Okay, let's buy food.
[185:26.20]Enter item number to buy.
[185:27.84]Food.
[185:31.26]Let's do like 20 food?
[185:34.36]A healing potion?
[185:35.14]I don't know.
[185:39.80]Should I scroll?
[185:41.63]I'm going to do two scrolls?
[185:48.68]I don't have enough for a magic potion.
[185:50.78]How about some crossbow bolts?
[185:52.96]Alright, I'll keep like 35 bucks.
[185:59.78]Alright, let's go.
[186:03.12]That's all I want.
[186:03.74]End buying.
[186:04.14]Seven.
[186:07.36]Oh dear.
[186:16.28]Alright, so I'm in a dead end.
[186:18.16]I guess I'm just going to go forward.
[186:28.09]How do I fight?
[186:29.43]You may not go in that direction.
[186:30.71]Yeah, because there's a ghost in front of me.
[186:32.95]How do I fight the ghost?
[186:34.94]Pass.
[186:39.40]What?
[186:41.46]No, I don't want to pass.
[186:42.50]This isn't Scrabble.
[186:44.66]I want to fight.
[186:48.74]Ooh, a cherry.
[186:49.72]Chest.
[186:50.74]You may not go in that direction.
[186:51.98]Open the chest.
[186:54.24]Is it like an open?
[186:56.50]Okay, I just... I pressed O. Open.
[187:02.30]Take.
[187:03.27]Grab.
[187:04.33]Get.
[187:04.57]Okay, you get some money.
[187:05.65]Get.
[187:05.93]G. What is this?
[187:11.67]Okay.
[187:13.67]Get the key.
[187:17.34]Oh, it's a little item store.
[187:18.66]Don't I have a bow?
[187:19.48]How do I shoot?
[187:23.56]Minutes.
[187:28.00]I think I'm sleeping.
[187:33.96]Oh my god, look at the food.
[187:35.74]How do I stop sleeping?
[187:40.31]How do I stop sleeping?
[187:44.85]Stop sleeping.
[187:46.59]Stop sleeping.
[187:49.62]Wake up, please.
[187:52.58]You sleep for an hour, okay.
[187:56.70]I didn't touch anything.
[188:01.70]I swear to god.
[188:02.83]Listen, my hands are off the keyboard.
[188:04.53]Hands up.
[188:05.35]They're up here.
[188:06.67]Do you hear this?
[188:07.79]I'm not touching shit.
[188:10.23]They're in the air.
[188:12.31]See?
[188:13.11]I'm not touching the fucking keyboard.
[188:19.96]No.
[188:20.64]He ate all the food and just laid down.
[188:22.70]I'm dead.
[188:23.22]You have to eat.
[188:30.27]Your body needs seven hours of sleep.
[188:33.65]I guess.
[188:36.59]Hold on.
[188:36.95]Let me try this again.
[188:42.54]I was eating in my sleep.
[188:43.74]Yeah.
[188:44.62]Makes no sense.
[188:51.38]So S is sleep, not shoot.
[188:55.80]Let's get that right.
[188:59.99]So shoot maybe is F for fire.
[189:05.81]All right, online instructions.
[189:09.28]Okay, attack.
[189:11.20]There will be two bars.
[189:12.30]One to aim up and down and one to aim left and right.
[189:16.60]When the bar is in position, press enter.
[189:19.50]The second bar will then be displayed when that bar is in position.
[189:22.30]So it's a golf game.
[189:25.83]Tiger Woods presents Dungeon of Death.
[189:30.13]Open, get.
[189:31.15]E is heal.
[189:34.89]Sleep.
[189:36.53]V is view.
[189:38.87]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[189:39.31]Easy, easy, easy.
[189:41.95]Alright, this is... T is teleport.
[189:49.16]Fireball is F. Spell is purple.
[189:53.84]Online commands.
[189:54.86]Yeah, alright.
[189:55.54]I think I got it.
[190:00.41]Let's take some more food, because that was ridiculous.
[190:04.44]I'm going to take two healing potions.
[190:07.13]I'll take some more bolts because that's all I have for this.
[190:11.53]And I'll take one scroll.
[190:14.15]And that's it.
[190:15.57]Let's go.
[190:17.34]I'm ready.
[190:19.40]A is attack.
[190:23.02]There's already a dragon in front of me.
[190:33.64]Did I hit it?
[190:34.50]You missed the monster.
[190:36.88]Somebody's just behind him.
[190:40.43]Oh my god.
[190:46.53]Direct hit.
[190:47.29]Okay, hit the monster.
[190:48.37]How much health does the monster have?
[190:51.01]F a fireball.
[190:58.89]No, don't sleep.
[190:59.75]Don't sleep.
[191:00.59]Thank god.
[191:12.69]I killed him.
[191:13.35]You've killed the monster, and here... Hey!
[191:17.06]Hi!
[191:17.54]It's my turn!
[191:23.24]This is like... I was gonna say Chad Mr. Krabs, but I don't think that was very funny.
[191:32.44]Take it as you will.
[191:38.33]You find some food on the dead monster.
[191:41.58]More food.
[191:42.80]That's blood.
[191:46.80]Yeah, that was... Larry the Lobster is just chad crabs.
[191:49.81]You're right.
[191:50.85]So why would I need to say that?
[191:57.15]Why is there no spooky music?
[191:58.39]I don't know.
[191:58.93]Is there an NPC...
[192:15.21]I thought it was an NPC, I don't know.
[192:18.83]And a head?
[192:21.11]Let's go for the head.
[192:21.71]I don't think that person was attacking me.
[192:35.92]Giant rat?
[192:40.54]It is a giant rat.
[192:52.07]Missed.
[192:53.31]It was a deflection, actually.
[192:54.85]I didn't miss.
[192:59.30]Kill the monster.
[193:00.18]Alright, I hit the door.
[193:02.84]There is a door blocking your way.
[193:04.92]Open.
[193:06.16]There's no closed chest here.
[193:08.88]Maybe I need a key.
[193:18.02]Wasn't there a key in that chest?
[193:24.71]No?
[193:25.49]You are hurt opening the chest.
[193:30.53]How?
[193:32.75]Did I stub my toe on it?
[193:33.95]I don't know how.
[193:35.30]Snake?
[193:38.80]Uh, didn't really... No, we walked by each other.
[193:41.60]Right in the mouth.
[193:50.07]Pretty decent graphics, though, for a game that came out when none of you were alive.
[193:56.91]I don't have any more bows.
[193:58.39]Uh-oh.
[193:59.89]Uh, turn around and run?
[194:01.45]Run?
[194:02.57]Run away?
[194:04.41]Where?
[194:04.97]How are you appearing in front of me?
[194:06.11]Heal.
[194:07.83]Frankie healing potion.
[194:08.65]E. I'm gonna run away and sleep.
[194:17.31]Why is he always in front of me?
[194:20.63]How do I get rid of this stupid snake?
[194:22.57]Please leave me alone.
[194:26.69]There's snakes in every direction.
[194:29.43]Sleep!
[194:29.63]Uh-oh.
[194:37.84]I think I pressed it three times.
[194:39.88]I went one, two, three.
[194:49.07]Did I?
[194:49.77]I went like one, two, three.
[194:54.75]Alright, I think it's only gonna be three hours.
[195:06.79]We've just read a food and it's gonna start coming down, but I should be awake.
[195:17.97]Eat all the food over the course of two days in your sleep and then die in your sleep because you don't eat any food.
[195:27.00]In an hour.
[195:27.66]Those appinels are... Those app... Those appinels?
[195:31.32]Those apples are poisonous.
[195:35.89]You don't eat a shitload of apples and then die unless they're poisoned.
[195:42.58]Maybe I pressed it four times.
[195:46.92]Drink a health potion.
[195:53.31]Come on.
[195:54.04]I didn't press it more than one... Whatever, I'm dead.
[195:56.98]I didn't press it more than three times.
[195:58.24]It just... I think it gets stuck.
[196:01.74]Oh, that was fun.
[196:05.93]There was a snake in every corner of the room.
[196:08.95]And that's alright.
[196:17.68]Now what?
[196:29.28]840 apples in one hour of sleep and then dies.

[200:08.83]What's in there?
[200:10.83]Why is there urine in there?
[200:17.20]That's not water.
[200:18.68]Is it beer?
[200:21.52]Juice?
[200:22.38]Nobody... What?
[200:27.30]It's honey.
[200:28.42]That's not honey.
[200:29.84]There's bubbles in it.
[200:34.83]It's all over the wall.
[200:36.71]Ow.
[200:37.69]Ow.
[200:45.87]We've also got Minnie talking on the phone.
[201:00.66]The treehouse.
[201:03.04]Dangerous to be up there, Mickey.
[201:12.49]We have the horseback riding.
[201:21.64]The Magician Show.
[201:28.68]And Under the Sea.
[201:31.06]Alright.
[201:32.65]Wait, there's more?
[201:38.09]Please insert another puzzle disc into the drive.
[201:40.67]Oh, never mind.
[201:42.15]Which one?
[201:44.95]I think the band one is pretty good.
[201:47.50]Oh, shit.
[201:48.34]I broke it.
[201:58.64]Uh... Hold on.
[202:04.86]Let me reload this shit.
[202:10.41]Let me reload it, it'll be fine.
[202:13.41]The band?
[202:13.89]I think it should be the band.
[202:18.61]Or the underwater.
[202:20.27]Underwater or band, which one?
[202:21.96]Literally the first one I see.
[202:23.18]Underwater or band.
[202:25.00]When I look, yeah, band.
[202:25.94]Okay.
[202:27.06]Okay.
[202:37.87]Is this going to be hard?
[202:45.16]How long is it going to be?
[202:51.14]Why do I watch this stream?
[202:55.98]I don't know.
[202:57.75]Alright, four pieces.
[203:01.75]Should I do four or 64?
[203:02.79]That's going to take too long.
[203:07.09]Let me just see what it looks like.
[203:07.87]This is actually going to be pretty easy.
[203:15.08]Alright, so, uh, time.
[203:18.08]I will do this in 15 minutes.
[203:25.51]Puzzle pieces.
[203:26.05]Alright, let's go.
[203:26.81]Oh, it's got the outlines.
[203:32.53]It's like it's cheating.
[203:37.20]It has the outlines.
[203:50.64]There.
[203:59.69]There.
[204:00.49]I got it.
[204:00.83]I got to do it right.
[204:02.93]All right.
[204:04.27]So I knew that.
[204:04.99]That's fine.
[204:05.39]I knew that was going to be there.
[204:06.11]Here we go.
[204:09.57]Always do the corners first.
[204:10.43]15 minutes.
[204:10.95]This is Donald.
[204:16.36]He's over here.
[204:19.36]Always do the edges first.
[204:20.58]If you can get the top edge, top part here.
[204:39.30]It's Donald right here.
[204:42.50]Okay.
[204:46.68]I need more top edges.
[204:56.36]Bingo.
[205:17.84]What do you mean it's fucked up?
[205:20.47]It's fine.
[205:22.65]Why do you guys tell me this is not the top edge?
[205:28.91]What?
[205:29.51]What are you talking about?
[205:33.79]You go around the circle, you do the whole thing around the edges, and then you do it.
[205:37.06]You do all edges first.
[205:44.72]Looking for one more.
[205:47.00]Where is it?
[205:49.10]Is it already out?
[205:51.34]Right.
[205:53.96]So, hold on.
[205:54.60]Is it?
[205:55.56]Okay, okay, it has to be up here.
[205:58.90]Whole top edge is done.
[205:59.76]Now we do the whole left side.
[206:03.36]You gotta get the outline of the picture first.
[206:08.11]Bingo.
[206:12.51]What, because I didn't have it up?
[206:14.23]It's, don't, whatever.
[206:15.35]I would have figured it out.
[206:17.85]I need the whole left side.
[206:21.79]You don't think I can do this in 15 minutes?
[206:25.89]Have you lost your mind?
[206:32.75]Already got that piece.
[206:34.67]Donald's already in the right spot.
[206:36.27]What is this?
[206:38.31]No, no, no, no, no.
[206:42.43]I got some right edge here.
[206:46.25]If you see an edge, just pick it up.
[206:49.63]Is this the bottom corner?
[206:50.58]No, it's not.
[206:53.36]It might be.
[206:53.70]Got an edge?
[207:02.63]I see one.
[207:03.29]Yeah, I do too.
[207:11.81]Then we got... I need more edges.
[207:15.39]I need the bottom.
[207:16.67]Bottom.
[207:19.19]Doesn't need to be perfect.
[207:19.85]Just get it in the right spot.
[207:22.71]Bottom.
[207:25.27]Just get it there.
[207:30.70]There's the corner.
[207:31.38]I don't see any more edges.
[207:39.10]There we go.
[207:42.54]There's a shoe?
[207:43.10]Uh-oh.
[207:53.92]Oh, I got it.
[207:54.90]We're good.
[208:00.20]Oh dear.
[208:01.04]It's fine.
[208:02.25]64 pieces is nothing.
[208:04.21]It really is nothing.
[208:10.79]I got 10 straight minutes of this.
[208:14.62]I can start to build out now.
[208:18.66]Uh, let's see.
[208:19.46]Hmm.
[208:22.64]That was goofy.
[208:25.62]I'm going against it.
[208:26.67]I shouldn't be doing this.
[208:28.75]Stop doing this.
[208:29.45]There's no reason to do this.
[208:32.69]Just do what I know.
[208:34.73]Get it done.
[208:37.43]Right here.
[208:37.69]You're gonna edge right here.
[208:40.77]Microphone?
[208:46.64]Is the bottom edge right here?
[208:49.12]Look at that.
[208:49.48]Is it an axophone?
[208:55.34]Is it an edge?
[208:57.70]Are his arms that long?
[209:13.67]They are.
[209:15.89]Okay, hold on.
[209:16.81]Saxophone.
[209:21.51]It's a little weird.
[209:22.49]Okay, I think we're... Now I can start to build out... Here's Goofy's face.
[209:33.84]Six minutes, we're fine.
[209:43.68]Get this out of the way.
[210:00.06]My hand is down here somewhere.
[210:21.13]You don't play the guitar.
[210:23.11]In front, like on your lap.
[210:27.07]It's alright, it'll be fine.
[210:28.73]This is goofy.
[210:37.13]Bottom piece?
[210:39.05]All right, bottom piece.
[210:48.22]I got plenty of time, so don't worry about me.
[210:51.40]Something's wrong though.
[210:59.21]What's wrong?
[211:06.62]Let go of this.
[211:07.36]I want to put it down.
[211:08.58]There we go.
[211:22.65]Let's do Goofy's mouth.
[211:28.53]How's that?
[211:29.13]Wrong.
[211:31.01]Because this is wrong.
[211:39.78]Let's do, uh, this is Mickey's guitar.
[211:59.31]How is he playing the guitar?
[212:04.71]Does he have three hands?
[212:07.03]Hold on, why does Mickey have three fucking hands?
[212:14.05]Okay, that's goo.
[212:15.43]I thought he was like, arms are off like this, like both hands extended.
[212:20.87]They got the same gloves on.
[212:22.51]Guys, give me a break.
[212:23.89]They have the same size hand and they're both wearing this teal blue robin's egg glove.
[212:33.27]This could have been this.
[212:34.82]This could have been this.
[212:36.66]It's identical.
[212:37.42]All right, hold on.
[212:42.94]I think that's in the right spot.
[212:56.36]It's down here at the floor.
[213:03.60]Alright, I actually am running out of time.
[213:07.00]Um... Put it down.
[213:11.56]How do I put it down?
[213:27.01]Shit.
[213:41.93]Okay, hold on.
[213:42.69]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[213:46.89]This is like right here.
[213:48.75]Somewhere right there.
[213:58.57]I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[213:59.79]There's Mickey's head.
[214:01.37]And his ears.
[214:15.25]Okay, good.
[214:17.75]Whose pants are these?
[214:20.35]This is Mickey's.
[214:20.75]No, it's not Mickey's.
[214:21.41]Okay, right there.
[214:34.86]Come on.
[214:35.32]Where is this?
[214:35.66]Where is this?
[214:37.22]Where is this?
[214:40.24]I don't know.

[215:47.63]Something on fire?
[215:48.53]What's the flaming thing here?
[215:52.27]Oh, they're all holding microphones.
[215:55.13]I got it.
[215:55.53]I can relax.
[215:58.32]But you can't relax because this would be the most embarrassing thing in the world if I did not do this in 15 minutes.
[216:05.68]I would seriously have to.
[216:09.00]I would have to go to the doctor if I couldn't do this in 15 minutes.
[216:12.82]You know what I'm saying?
[216:18.05]It would be like, what's the problem?
[216:20.51]Are you all right?
[216:22.03]Tell me your symptoms.
[216:24.28]I couldn't do a children's puzzle in 15 minutes.
[216:27.90]Oh.
[216:29.70]Oh.
[216:31.42]Okay.
[216:32.60]Let's figure that out.
[216:36.64]I guess we're done with this one.
[216:41.48]13 minutes and 7 seconds.
[216:44.63]It still took 13 minutes.
[216:46.19]That's fine.
[216:48.03]Can I videotape it?
[216:56.98]Let's see what happens.
[217:11.95]Nice.
[217:15.19]nice all right they have fun animations no I don't want to I'm going to do like okay here's the deal if I can't do a 16 piece puzzle in less than three minutes

[217:49.49]Okay.
[217:51.94]Hold on.
[217:52.18]I need to, I want a new picture though.

[219:33.65]It's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair, hold on.
[219:35.77]I can't, you can't do this in 60 seconds.
[219:37.27]I can't even put this piece down.
[219:51.84]No, this has to be down lower.
[219:57.27]I'm losing time because I can't put it down.
[220:04.51]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[220:06.09]Do it again.
[220:07.96]Fuck.

[222:42.06]Somebody wrote, this is fucking lame.
[222:44.45]Laughing my ass off.
[222:59.54]No, stop.
[223:00.10]Alright, I'm done with this one.
[223:02.90]Thanks a lot, Vicky.
[223:11.52]I feel like this has been some really good ones on this list.
[223:16.24]Where to now?
[223:18.56]There's only a couple that I think people even wanted to see.
[223:20.37]I kind of knew it was going to happen.
[223:28.27]One of these two.
[223:37.82]code name ice man or super carts oh it's screwed up it's screwed up hold on try it again there was infinite clicks we're on didn't make it count go ahead

[224:27.07]Okay, let's just do them both.
[224:29.23]Let's do Super Cards and then Codename Iceman and then we'll scroll down.
[224:39.09]That's too close.
[224:42.61]Super carts.
[224:52.31]You demand a recount.
[224:56.17]You get to see it.
[224:59.19]You get two presidents at the same time.

[225:54.42]Redefine keys.
[225:55.46]Accelerate, brake, left, right, reverse.
[225:57.42]I'm assuming they're probably... Accelerate will be W. Brake will be S. Left, right, reverse will be R. Select will be E. Activate will be enter.
[226:12.07]Right?
[226:12.69]That makes sense.
[226:17.57]Confirm.
[226:20.77]I don't care about two-player mode.
[226:30.74]New game?
[226:32.40]Go karting arcade mode.

[226:48.47]It's just a guy with a cigar in his mouth.
[226:55.44]Klaus?
[226:58.60]Get in the shadows of the Hollywood Hills.
[227:01.54]The LA-1 circuit is one of the high, hard, widest, easiest, most laid-back track of the series.
[227:10.76]So laid-back that it's actually on the beach.
[227:14.58]I couldn't say that word.
[227:20.68]So is this just Mario Kart?
[227:22.80]Somebody already flipped over into the floor.
[227:26.15]This is actually pretty good for it being a random dumpster.
[227:29.63]It's freaking loud.
[227:30.37]I'm sorry.
[227:50.15]What place am I in?
[227:52.43]How are we all down here?
[227:54.55]Okay.
[227:57.47]What is this?
[228:01.73]T?
[228:03.25]How do I use that?
[228:06.85]E?
[228:09.11]E?
[228:10.13]T. E. That was turbo.
[228:39.61]Hey!
[228:39.93]What?
[228:40.20]Why did this come out of nowhere?
[228:46.50]I'll get up there.
[229:12.13]That pattern keeps fucking with my head.
[229:13.89]Do it again.
[229:16.07]I'll do it better this time.
[229:47.63]If I don't get first place right now, then I'm going to the doctor tomorrow.
[230:20.29]Was it that loud?
[230:27.47]How loud was that?
[230:28.07]Let me see.
[230:32.41]Was it actually that loud?
[230:33.77]Do it again.
[230:34.17]I'll do it better this time.
[230:38.72]Oh, Jesus.
[230:39.12]This was horrible.
[230:49.96]It was like that the whole time?
[230:51.12]Shit.
[230:53.85]I'm sorry.
[230:54.37]Alright, code name Iceman.
[231:02.74]Okay.
[231:03.82]This is an old Sierra game.
[231:17.90]So that means I'll probably give up at about 10 minutes.
[231:22.26]Because it's going to have me combine like three items and I'm not going to know what to do with the shoehorn, the bubblegum, and the empty bottle.
[231:31.21]I will not know what to do with them.
[231:41.14]Mike is muted.
[231:41.86]Mike is not muted.
[231:43.86]I'm very clearly not muted.
[231:52.93]I'm turning it down.
[231:53.55]There we go.
[231:57.52]Codename... Iceman.
[232:02.60]By Sierra.
[232:17.01]Welcome to the beautiful island of Tahiti, where warm south Pacific breezes caress the emerald clear waters of a sun-filled paradise.
[232:24.61]A place of fun and relaxation, a place where love and romance can be found.
[232:28.03]A wonderland where anyone can get lost in its magic.
[232:32.63]We find our man, Lieutenant Commander John D. Westland of the United States Navy, enjoying a well-deserved leave from his recent... Our story opens with Commander Westland on the beach, soaking up the sun.
[232:55.63]That's me.
[232:56.57]Can't get up?
[232:57.27]Why do I stand up?
[232:59.15]Oh, God.
[232:59.91]Stand.
[233:32.62]Go!
[233:38.04]Flex.
[233:56.10]You've left me responseless.
[234:00.34]Okay.
[234:02.40]Can I go in the house?
[234:03.70]I can enter this clubhouse.
[234:11.65]What's this say?
[234:22.84]Open door.
[234:26.62]You can't go in the lobby without your shirt.
[234:28.62]Oh, I have to go get this shirt.

[253:28.02]Give too good breath, look, listen, feel, check pulse.
[253:30.84]What the fuck are you talking about?
[253:33.96]Shake and shout?
[253:37.86]After gently shaking the victim, you try getting a response by saying, are you okay?
[253:50.94]um call for help turn into the others you shout please someone go for emergency medical aid excitedly the man says oh I'll take care of that and he stomped all he just stepped on her like three times then um establish airway
[254:21.34]Quickly, you tilt her head back and open her mouth.
[254:24.73]Sweeping the open mouth with your finger, you make sure nothing is blocking her airway.
[254:33.55]Okay.
[254:35.09]Then... What happens after this?
[254:39.85]Now you... Look?
[254:46.42]Shake and shout?

[254:51.20]Look, listen, and feel.
[254:52.76]Look, listen, and feel.
[254:56.86]You place your ear close to the victim's mouth and you try to listen and hear, feel for a breath.
[255:01.65]At the same time, you look to see if the chest is moving.
[255:08.03]Okay.
[255:12.35]E-mode only mode.
[255:13.31]Oh shit, but I don't know what to do.
[255:14.99]I don't know what the next part is.
[255:18.14]Behave yourselves.
[255:19.44]Behave yourselves so I can know what to do next.
[255:24.97]Behave.
[255:26.71]Or I'll turn it off.
[255:27.31]I'll turn chat off forever.
[255:30.93]What do I do next?
[255:38.26]Breathe.
[255:54.53]Check pulse.
[255:56.34]It's been a long time.
[255:57.98]You will find the correct answer.
[256:02.20]Oh, shit.
[256:04.48]Look and listen.
[256:05.98]Give too good breath.
[256:08.28]Give too good breath.
[256:13.26]You pinch the nostrils closed, open your mouth wide, and take a deep breath.
[256:17.63]You make a tight seal over the victim's mouth and breathe into her mouth.
[256:21.07]You take another deep breath and breathe into her mouth again, watching her chest rise.
[256:27.55]Look at this.
[256:28.61]Look at this face.
[256:29.39]Just like, did that work?
[256:30.76]I don't know.
[256:34.48]Look, listen, and feel.
[256:38.44]After giving the victim two ventilations, you look, listen, and feel again.
[256:41.28]However, you still can't get a response.
[256:44.94]Compress chest.
[256:47.14]Check pulse.
[256:52.40]You check the cardioid artery for five to ten seconds.
[256:55.64]Unfortunately, you don't.
[257:05.54]Compress chest?
[257:07.12]Is there anything else I can do?
[257:15.76]Begin compression.
[257:19.41]But isn't she dead?
[257:23.61]Quickly, you locate the bottom of the sternum using your index and middle fingers.
[257:26.51]You measure up the chest, finding the proper point to start the compressions.
[257:30.13]Using the heel of your hands, keeping your fingers from touching the chest, you start chest compressions at a ratio of 15 compressions to two breaths.
[257:39.57]You act fast, compressing the chest one and a half, two inches at a rate of 100 to 100, 80 to 100.
[257:44.82]In the excitement, you think to yourself, I must check her pulse in one minute.
[257:52.48]She's already dead.
[258:04.44]Okay, she's alive again.
[258:07.31]Back to life.
[258:14.15]This is actually just a CPR tutorial.
[258:18.17]It's getting stronger.
[258:21.83]Oh, it took you long enough.
[258:24.22]You watch as the doctor examines the girl.
[258:27.02]Where have you been?
[258:30.66]The doctor turns to you and says...
[258:34.22]Well, sir, thanks to you, this young lady is going to be just fine.
[258:38.78]She starts moaning and mumbling and attempting to get up.
[258:42.62]She insists on standing, so you help her up.
[258:45.40]I don't know if they should be standing.
[258:47.30]They were dead for about five minutes.
[258:53.59]The young lady you just rescued thanks you for saving her life.
[258:56.15]It was fortunate for me that you were here and that you're a strong swimmer.
[258:58.95]Okay.
[259:03.63]Welcome back to life.
[259:04.81]18 points.

[259:54.43]Iceman, right.
[260:02.72]Now what do I do?
[260:03.32]Those are the same two huts.
[260:13.78]That's odd.
[260:14.48]What the hell just happened?
[260:22.64]You don't have the key to open the door.
[260:27.89]There's no response.
[260:51.56]Go get your shirt and then walk to the top to reach the hotel?

[261:41.34]Alright, get shirt, go all the way to the top.
[261:49.38]Put on shirt.

[300:14.76]2729.
[300:16.38]General.
[300:17.92]After a few rings, someone on the other end answers.
[300:20.76]The voice bellows.
[300:21.74]General Braxton here.
[300:22.64]What can I do for you?
[300:30.36]What's with the... What?
[300:40.93]Did I just prank call the general?

[300:55.35]Which one?
[301:01.07]This is General Braxton.
[301:01.87]What can I do for you?

[301:19.59]Where on earth have you been, Johnny?
[301:21.57]We've got an explosive situation on our hands and you've been playing around on that island.
[301:26.39]Due to the sensitive nature of what we are dealing with, I can't give any details over the phone.
[301:30.70]I need you here in Washington as soon as possible.
[301:32.80]Report to the maximum security briefing room.
[301:35.98]After acknowledging your orders to Washington, you say goodbye and hang up the phone.

[301:47.65]Then apparently I have to call somebody else.
[301:52.99]How would I know who this person was?
[301:58.15]I have to call a dingy phone number.
[302:08.32]Dial the number, talk, use phone, dial the Nosinski dingy phone number.
[302:20.03]Where did we get that?

[302:43.21]Hold on.
[302:45.20]Yeah, there's a sign somewhere.
[302:48.24]Does somebody have it?
[302:48.96]Somebody has it.

[303:22.35]I don't know what the fucking number you just told me was.
[303:29.35]I have to go look at it.
[303:30.48]It's a sign that's gonna be over here somewhere.
[303:34.58]It's in the hotel.

[305:17.80]Hey, Trevor Democrat, no!
[305:19.80]It's not even that low.
[305:21.26]It's like pretend low.
[305:33.21]How does that service even work?
[305:37.07]So if you get paid an annuity or something, right?
[305:41.81]You can say, hey, J.G.
[305:43.37]Wentworth, take all that money.
[305:45.47]You get the annuity, right?
[305:49.17]But then they give you a percentage of what it would be up front.
[305:55.62]So let's say it was over the course of a 10-year period, you're going to get $100,000.
[305:59.86]You'd call J.G.
[306:00.70]Wentworth, and they'd give you like $68,000.
[306:02.18]Or $6,800.
[306:02.96]Whatever it is, $68,000.
[306:04.75]Immediately, right?
[306:05.81]Or is it way worse than that?
[306:21.14]So it's, oh, it's $10,000 a year for 10 years, but I want $65,000 right now.
[306:29.51]That's where those services make money.
[306:41.87]Hence the 877 cash now.
[306:45.95]You need cash now, right?
[307:04.12]What do you mean there's no answer?
[307:10.79]Wasn't that the number?
[307:14.45]6969.
[307:24.20]I don't need the, like, area code?
[307:36.98]Oh.
[307:37.74]No stinky dingy transport.
[307:41.92]No sinky dingy transport.
[307:43.70]Can I help you?
[307:46.70]Are these 50 cents?
[307:48.51]That's all I have.
[307:55.93]Fuck.
[307:57.23]No.
[307:57.41]Fuck.
[308:08.73]Yes, I need a boat.
[308:10.42]Please give me a boat.
[308:12.24]Can I help you?
[308:16.14]You advised the person of your location and that you need transportation to the airport.
[308:20.04]You told to meet the dinghy in front of the hotel entrance.
[308:22.78]Click.
[308:23.67]Okay.
[308:24.33]Thank you.
[308:31.21]Why am I taking a dinghy?
[308:40.34]Why not?
[308:40.80]Hold on.
[308:44.40]So I'm on an island across the world and I'm going to take this dinghy to Washington?
[308:52.93]I'll be there in six months.
[308:55.48]Maybe not.
[308:55.84]I'll be there in like five years.
[308:57.08]That's going to take a long time.
[309:11.35]This is just a ploy to get rid of me.
[309:13.77]Yes, okay.
[309:15.03]Commander Westman, we want you to go to Westford.
[309:19.19]What's this guy's name?
[309:21.17]Westman?
[309:22.17]Commander Westman.
[309:24.86]It's a very important mission.
[309:25.82]You must take the dinghy to Washington.
[309:31.26]They're just trying to get rid of me.
[309:35.10]Next stop, Tahiti Airport.
[309:40.29]Commander, what's his name?
[309:41.43]Westman?
[309:45.27]Weston?
[309:47.39]Westman?
[309:48.15]Westland?
[309:50.03]No, no, no, my character's name.
[310:02.10]Wentworth.
[310:03.48]Oh, my stomach.
[310:04.14]All right, so I'm on point.
[310:12.41]I'm just here.
[310:12.87]The land at Dulles Airport.
[310:27.10]No time for backtracking.
[310:28.14]What are you talking about?
[310:34.42]What's this character's name?
[310:36.92]Don't get hit.
[310:38.22]Watch out!
[310:51.65]The door opens automatically.
[310:56.78]Are you Command Westland?
[310:58.28]That's right, I was right.
[311:00.56]Yes.
[311:03.99]Show ID.
[311:08.05]He exams it closely, thanks you, as he returns it and says, please have a seat, Command.
[311:27.90]God dammit.
[311:35.06]Ah, here we are.
[311:37.53]The Pentagon.
[311:40.45]Quite the parking lot for the Pentagon.
[311:42.49]The Pentagon has less spaces than a strip mall.
[311:53.21]And aren't there supposed to be, like, 5,000 people working in here?
[311:57.28]That's quite the ride share.
[312:04.86]A 7-Eleven has more parking spaces than the Pentagon, apparently.
[312:15.12]Your ID, please.
[312:21.32]Thank you very much, Commander.
[312:22.22]You've been expected.
[312:24.39]Please pass through which one You hear the whine of the elevator as it approaches
[312:59.10]Sir, I must see proper identification before you pass.
[313:09.45]Thank you very much, Commander.
[313:10.35]You may pass through.
[313:11.03]I actually didn't have that.
[313:39.65]Commander?
[313:40.15]Commander?
[313:42.17]How are you?
[313:44.45]Sorry about that.
[313:50.09]What?
[313:53.93]Hold on, I can't go back up.
[314:01.01]No.
[314:03.35]What do you mean?
[314:03.91]You only allow access to elevators for your briefing?
[314:08.72]Did my, like, I'm a four-year-old lock me out of the game?
[314:14.80]Have a nice day, sir.
[314:15.90]Okay, bye.
[314:17.18]What?
[314:47.76]It's amazing this one cowardly act of kidnapping has brought two powers.
[314:54.71]It's very urgent that you get here, Commander Westland.
[314:59.31]Please ride an elevator up and then an elevator down and then fucking leave.
[315:09.84]My stomach is gonna fucking explode.
[315:13.60]Alright.
[315:24.55]I think that's where I end this one.
[315:35.81]I mean, how do we go further from this?
[315:45.34]I'm not sure you can get any better than the elevator briefing.
[315:56.48]Now what?
[315:59.10]Talk.
[316:00.88]I'm here to pick up Commander Westland, he says.
[316:02.48]Are you Commander Westland?
[316:04.75]Show ID.
[316:09.15]Okay, yes.
[316:10.77]May I see your orders, please?
[316:12.67]Uh-oh.
[316:33.02]Just Hulk out and run.
[317:06.48]I'm gonna laugh my ass off if I can go back on the plane and go back up the elevator.
[317:51.44]Restore?
[317:52.16]Is this going to work?
[317:54.38]Guys.
[317:55.65]There is no restore point.
[317:57.55]It's over.
[318:05.47]Oh well.
[318:11.09]I was supposed to save.
[318:11.91]I did not.
[318:12.29]Okay.
[318:12.59]Yeah.
[318:12.87]Maybe I was supposed to save the game.
[318:14.67]But did you honestly think I was going to be in this one for more than an hour?
[318:18.16]I don't think so.
[318:24.65]That was great.
[318:26.45]I'm going to go take one more break.
[318:27.94]I'll be right back.
[318:30.42]We'll do a few more.
[318:34.32]I will see you in a minute.
[321:23.38]Okay.
[321:24.26]This next one we're gonna do.
[321:28.44]This will probably be... This one will be the last one.
[321:33.13]One more.
[321:34.19]Or two more.
[321:36.63]And it's gonna be... I just saw it and I just had to click it.
[321:42.09]This is, uh... Mavis Beacon teaches typing.
[321:58.47]I need to improve.
[322:03.81]Okay.
[322:07.15]Today's lesson, ASDF keys.
[322:08.81]Welcome to Mavis Beacon.
[322:10.17]Teach us typing.
[322:11.05]Meet Mavis.
[322:13.33]Here's a quick tour of Mavis Beacon.
[322:14.79]Teach us typing.
[322:15.43]Press a key to begin.
[322:16.49]Press escape to stop the tour.
[322:19.97]When Mavis prepares a new lesson, she explains its goals and format here.
[322:24.39]You may take the suggestion or do something else.
[322:26.37]Among your many options are the arcade race, free typing practice, keys and fingers, proficient keys display, and progress graphing.
[322:33.74]You can even build your own lesson using Mavis's suggestion as a start.
[322:38.80]Okay, let's go to the classroom.
[322:42.26]You and Mavis will work on specific problems.
[322:47.15]This is where your lessons appear.
[322:48.39]If this is where your lessons appear, if this were a real lesson, you'd type what you see here.
[322:53.63]Okay.
[322:53.83]All right.
[322:55.19]All right.
[322:55.55]You got it.
[322:57.81]Workshop is where you practice what you've learned.
[322:59.49]Let's go there now.
[323:02.05]Here's the workshop.
[323:03.66]Meters and gauges will measure and hone your skills.
[323:06.82]Text from fascinating sources like on the left, the meters show accuracy, speed, and lesson completions.
[323:17.56]On the right are the clock and the metronome.
[323:23.00]We learn best when learning is fun.
[323:24.54]Here in the arcade, you're pitted against a merciless opponent.
[323:26.88]This is going to be a lot of fun.
[323:36.43]Over 20 graphs show you how you're doing.
[323:38.83]You may choose, you may use this information if you choose to create your own lesson.
[323:42.57]There's a lot more, but it's fun.
[323:44.67]All right, let's go.
[323:46.35]Start the lessons.

[324:18.82]I'm okay.
[324:19.86]I'm not a beginner, but I need some work.

[325:27.78]I'll do 50.
[325:33.14]50 words per minute.
[325:34.82]Okay.
[325:35.85]Looks good.
[325:39.17]Looks good to me.
[325:39.95]Don't look up there.
[325:42.51]That's a secret one.

[325:52.46]Your current skills.
[325:53.32]Welcome.
[325:54.70]For the next few lessons, we'll do some general exercises to get a feel for your typing.
[325:58.90]Later, we'll tailor lessons, especially for you.
[326:02.22]Let's begin with some warm-ups.
[326:04.39]Covering all the keys.
[326:05.43]Watch this cursor, and as always, type the character right above it.
[326:10.03]Good luck and have fun.
[326:13.92]Alright, so... The next key you type will start the lesson.
[326:17.75]Once started, you may use the escape key to end the lesson early.
[326:20.29]60, okay.
[326:23.17]Here we go.

[327:29.71]Okay, it's out.
[327:31.27]How do I do this one?
[327:33.39]It's killing my words per minute.
[327:34.71]How do I do it?
[327:35.28]Which one is this one?
[327:35.98]What's the up one?
[327:37.14]It's not even on my keyboard.

[329:29.13]Since you're an immediate typist, we assume you know the locations of all the keys without looking on how to type them.

[329:50.43]The metronome has been set to five words per minute faster than you...
[329:57.80]Typed previously.
[329:58.90]See if you can keep pace.
[330:00.12]We won't score your accuracy this lesson, so go for all the speed you can.
[330:03.92]I'm ready.
[330:05.90]Okay.
[330:09.37]Your typing is faster than the metronome can go.
[330:12.29]Wait.
[330:13.53]Here is where you'll work on specific problems.
[330:15.19]Wow, your typing is faster than the metronome can go.
[330:17.33]If you type two characters per beat, you'll stay in time.

[333:26.85]That's fine.
[333:30.13]Let's put your skills to a fun test.
[333:31.71]In a moment, you'll be behind the wheel of your typing racer.
[333:35.56]I'm looking down at my keyboard.
[333:36.44]Yes, I have to.
[333:38.28]I've been... I can't.
[333:40.08]I have to look.
[333:40.93]I have to look because I know where the keys are, but I don't... Here's the thing.
[333:44.49]I know where every key is.
[333:47.69]In fact, just to make sure I could prove this to people.
[333:53.94]But how does... No.
[333:55.26]I was going to draw a keyboard without looking.
[334:01.76]But I can't prove that.
[334:08.29]I, listen, I know where every key is on the keyboard, but my problem is not in knowing where the keys are, my problem is hand placement.
[334:22.11]And when I move my finger, let's say for instance like F, G, T, R, that little spot there, like A, S, D, F, do this with me at the same time.
[334:30.88]Pinky on A, ring finger on S, middle D, index F, and then J, K, L, semi, right?
[334:38.16]Your thumbs are open.
[334:39.60]Sit there with me.
[334:40.74]So you have J, K, L, semi, A, S, D, F. I know that R is right here above F. I know it is, but I can't, I'll miss because I can't see it.
[334:54.88]I can't see the physical button and it's hard for me.
[335:02.51]I can't do it.
[335:03.81]I miss... I know that the letters are there, but my placement of my fingers and moving my hands across the keyboard... I can't do it.
[335:13.27]I'm fucking dumb, okay?
[335:17.85]Just try it.
[335:18.83]It's not gonna work.
[335:22.15]Anthony Smith Corona may equal his world record speed of 32 words per minute.
[335:25.62]Can you leave him in the dust?
[335:26.72]Begin typing to start your engine.
[335:29.74]Alright, I'm gonna try it.
[335:30.76]JKL Semi.
[335:35.25]Brazen gazelles He's laying me in the dust!
[336:06.00]I can't see.
[336:06.64]I need to know what they are.
[336:08.30]Because I can't.
[336:09.00]I need to get it into memory so I can write it.
[336:12.46]I'll catch up to him.
[336:16.10]Slow down.
[336:28.28]He's doing just as bad as I am.
[336:38.48]Neck and neck!
[336:38.90]I'm gonna puke!
[337:08.44]I have to look up and down, up and down, up and down.
[337:12.36]To see that the next word.
[337:14.62]I'm dumping the water out of the boat as it's sinking.
[337:25.91]What?
[337:52.55]Can this be over?
[337:56.41]I seriously can't do it anymore, please.
[337:58.31]I need to fall over.
[338:02.22]I need to fall over.
[338:08.90]No!
[338:25.69]Oh my god.
[338:29.23]It's the eyes up, eyes down, eyes up, eyes down, eyes up, eyes down.
[338:32.41]I just see the word that was coming in right after it.
[338:40.31]I don't think I can do that again.
[338:47.56]What?
[338:50.36]Skill typists never look at the keys as they type.
[338:52.38]Let's see how accurate you can be on these hurdle words without the key tops showing.
[338:57.04]What do you mean, key tops?
[339:03.49]You must type each key correctly before moving ahead.
[339:06.75]The next key you type will start the lesson.
[339:13.69]I have to cam my face.
[339:14.69]I don't need clothes on.
[339:17.75]Oh fuck, hold on, let me just put like a t-shirt on.
[339:20.60]Do I have a shirt on in here?
[339:25.32]I'll just put like a blanket around me.
[339:38.91]Okay.
[339:48.43]That should be good.
[339:52.55]I'm just going to stuff it in here and then... Alright.
[339:54.73]That should be alright.
[339:58.72]Let's see.
[339:59.08]Right?
[340:00.36]That's okay, right?
[340:06.66]Let me just... Let me check it first.
[340:12.01]That's not good enough.
[340:12.87]I gotta... Hold on.
[340:19.74]Okay, that's better.
[340:53.14]Shit.
[340:59.45]You're in a Snuggie.
[341:01.09]Hold on, hold on, I can't... Snuggie!
[341:16.23]Okay, I'm just gonna look straight ahead.
[341:28.24]You ready?
[341:34.81]A, S, D, F, J, K, L, Semi.
[341:38.41]Okay.
[342:14.95]Okay, I got that I got that pretty good

[343:28.82]This sucks.
[343:38.81]Holy shit, look at the neck.
[343:42.53]Do I have that much skin?
[343:45.56]I do not have that much skin.
[343:49.42]What?
[343:49.80]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[343:55.25]I'm wearing a rubber mask of my own face.
[344:41.42]I don't want to do this anymore Do I have to do the whole alphabet?
[345:19.02]Okay.
[345:19.86]Almost done.
[345:30.83]I can't do it.
[345:31.95]I actually can't do this.
[345:33.51]I can't do this.
[345:38.34]You look like a ventriloquist dummy.
[345:42.08]Why don't I just go get a goddamn shirt on?
[345:58.97]That's better.
[346:18.82]These words are hard.
[346:19.88]These are like the brain hurt words.
[346:34.10]Okay.
[346:34.72]That was fun.
[346:41.18]Okay.
[346:43.12]Get this off of me!
[346:46.25]Camera's off, right?
[346:46.81]Yeah.
[346:48.79]Get this fucking thing off me!
[346:59.37]Uh... I don't want to do this anymore.
[347:01.41]My head hurts.
[347:06.94]I'm going to try to do this as fast as possible.
[347:10.58]Ready?
[347:11.54]I don't care if I make errors.
[347:19.91]Did I mess up too many times?
[347:26.07]He was not used to the heaviness of the Earth's atmosphere.
[347:47.62]Yeah, I would.
[347:50.92]How the fuck do some of you guys do this shit?
[347:57.66]How do you do 100 words a minute?
[348:05.29]I don't even know how that's possible.
[348:10.23]That's so so fast.
[348:33.19]Speed, but hold on a minute.
[348:34.25]Speed by key.
[348:37.77]I hit N R Y and H the fastest.
[348:45.35]That's kind of interesting.
[348:50.29]No, no, no.
[348:51.05]All right.
[348:51.35]So yeah.
[348:52.03]N R Y H I D are the ones I hit the fastest.
[348:57.29]All right.
[348:57.97]Uh, words a minute by session.
[349:00.53]No.
[349:03.51]Accuracy by key.
[349:05.19]I can always get the Z. S, J, and T are my problem zones.
[349:20.36]All of them are apparently.
[349:23.41]Number of keys.
[349:23.99]I don't think I even did any of those.
[349:29.58]Errors by hand.
[349:31.64]My left hand.
[349:32.74]If only I didn't have this left hand.
[349:40.01]That actually kind of makes sense though.
[349:44.21]Errors by row.
[349:45.29]Interesting.
[349:49.30]Recovery rate after errors.
[349:52.96]T-R-E-A Okay.
[349:58.78]That's funny.
[350:05.78]Backspace errors, N has the most.
[350:11.26]Interesting.
[350:13.60]That's pretty funny.
[350:24.89]Surprisingly good software.
[350:27.47]I mean this, I think, don't they still make this?
[350:35.32]I swear, doesn't Mavis... They still have it, right?
[350:44.22]Alright.
[350:46.34]Let's do one more.
[350:48.84]Holy fuck, I thought the camera was still on underneath that window.
[350:53.34]Then it didn't turn it off.
[350:54.82]But it did, so thank god.
[350:56.06]Otherwise that would have been really embarrassing.
[351:07.44]We can't.
[351:07.74]We've got to end on Burgablaster.
[351:19.13]You already showed yourself shirtless.
[351:21.09]That wasn't a full body shirtless.
[351:27.39]This is close-up chest.
[351:30.59]And I've got some work that I need to do here.
[351:34.97]We're gonna end on burger, uh, scenario, whatever it's called.
[351:38.70]I think we played this one before, but this is a different version.
[351:47.76]Is this the same game?
[351:51.09]Come on.
[351:53.57]Fire?
[351:55.31]What is this game?
[351:57.17]Holy shit, this is awesome.
[351:59.55]Wrong piece.
[352:00.14]Alright, I need the bottom button, right?
[352:02.58]Bottom button.
[352:04.89]There it is.
[352:10.13]Missed the catch.
[352:18.31]How did I miss the catch?
[352:19.31]Okay.
[352:23.31]And we need, uh... Patty?
[352:27.96]That's not... I didn't get it?
[352:28.88]No, I got it.
[352:32.02]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[352:36.02]Go.
[352:39.12]Oh, come on.
[352:40.14]Now I know what's wrong.
[352:42.84]The speed is up as much as it can possibly go.
[352:45.42]I was wondering what the hell was going on.
[353:07.64]I'm looking at chat.
[353:10.06]Why can I not stop this?
[353:11.13]Alright, grab the burger.
[353:15.71]Pretty good shot.
[353:21.33]This is now in slow-mo.
[353:22.69]I think this is on normal.
[353:24.41]Alright, maybe it's normal now.
[353:27.27]Now it's normal now?
[353:29.47]Maybe now?
[353:31.13]I think it's normal now.
[353:38.41]I need the top bun.
[353:41.03]No!
[353:41.59]I didn't want to shoot.
[353:42.53]Damn it.
[353:43.23]Top bun.
[353:44.19]Where are the top buns?
[353:45.59]This is just a worse version of the Donald Duck suitcase game.
[353:55.74]There we go.
[353:56.22]There's the Super Mario World mushroom top platform.
[354:01.00]You know that's my favorite piece of art from Super Mario World?
[354:19.21]Is it Mario?
[354:20.07]No, it's Mario 1.
[354:20.81]Sorry.
[354:21.21]I'm not trying to shoot.
[354:23.71]It's actually original Mario.
[354:30.32]Alright.
[354:30.78]I'm not ending on this one.
[354:33.60]That one was not very good.
[354:35.24]Alright.
[354:35.52]Streamer's Choice.
[354:36.12]I already got one ready for you.
[354:38.08]Oh boy.
[354:38.54]Oh fuck.
[354:38.90]I'm going to be here for a while.
[354:41.98]Yep.
[354:42.26]I'll be here for a little while.
[354:45.00]Damn it.
[354:45.64]Do I have to really play this?
[354:46.62]I knew I wanted to play it.
[354:50.34]Alright, I'm going to give myself a time limit here.
[354:52.36]We're going to play Press Your Luck, the game with the whammies.
[355:07.85]Are we?
[355:16.82]Are we not?
[355:25.94]Try it again.
[355:31.09]We are not going to play.
[355:33.99]Unfortunately.
[355:39.83]Unfortunately, we're not.
[355:41.54]It will not load.
[355:47.08]That's unfortunate.
[355:54.27]Okay.
[355:57.28]Streamer's Choice sucked.
[355:58.70]Yeah, unfortunately.
[356:02.90]Will this one work to go out on?
[356:08.32]Will Junior Pac-Man work?
[356:13.52]What's the difference between Junior Pac-Man and regular Pac-Man?
[356:23.64]16, I got them all.
[356:28.58]Well, I know it's way too high.
[356:29.26]This shit is on hyper speed.
[356:30.00]I'm trying to make it slower!
[356:30.62]Getting a lot of points.
[357:03.17]Fuck!
[357:11.45]Alright, I- I- It's- Maybe it's not- I'm trying to make it slower, but it won't do it!
[357:16.25]It's going too fast!
[357:20.19]It's going too fa- Alright.
[357:29.23]I have to be level 1, even if it's on x3 speed.
[357:32.56]I didn't even do anything.
[357:33.42]I didn't press any buttons.
[357:34.10]You would have heard it.
[357:35.41]You would have heard that.
[357:38.51]I did not press anything.
[357:42.89]Just go.
[357:43.51]Go, go, go, go, go.
[357:44.19]I can do it.
[357:47.25]This is fucked up.
[357:48.65]Sometimes the presses don't work.
[357:57.62]Alright, this is fucked up.
[358:00.06]This is really messed up.
[358:04.13]I can feel it hanging.
[358:07.87]Oh!
[358:12.63]Did it.
[358:17.39]What?
[358:20.30]Who's that character?
[358:22.46]Why is there an Apple Pac-Man?
[358:50.94]This game is playing the brown node.
[359:12.67]Ooh, almost got me.
[359:13.83]Not quite.
[359:30.70]Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[359:35.50]Ah, my hand.
[359:40.88]Come on.
[359:42.23]I can get past this.
[359:43.69]I have two more lives.
[359:51.25]Done.
[359:57.36]I'm done.
[360:01.79]Give me the drum.
[360:12.08]Why does my hand hurt so much?
[360:13.80]I don't understand!
[360:23.69]My hand is killing me.
[360:25.37]My right hand, my pinky, my ring finger are killing me.
[360:29.83]I don't know what it is.
[360:30.49]What's happening to me?
[360:34.20]I'm gonna stop taking, like, glucosamine.
[360:36.20]God damn it!
[360:42.32]Ow!
[360:52.92]That shit doesn't work, does it not?
[360:58.92]Use the controller?
[360:59.58]No, that was just a little fun thing to do at the end.
[361:06.93]There, I saved you.
[361:11.57]Alright, that's gonna be it.
[361:13.57]Right at the six hour mark.
[361:17.67]Those were quite a few games, by the way.
[361:24.89]I can still hear it, though, so I have to turn this off.
[361:27.49]Get out of my head.
[361:28.67]What the fuck?
[361:30.59]Okay, I don't know if it's just me.
[361:32.73]Is it just me?
[361:33.27]Because when I took out my headphone, it was like... Is that happening to anybody else?
[361:41.86]Take your headphones off right now.
[361:44.26]It was like... My voice right now is...
[361:59.28]Dude, that was fucking wild.
[362:10.54]Shattered eardrum.
[362:16.90]No, it wasn't very low.
[362:18.40]It's just that sound just permeated my brain.
[362:23.29]Maybe you should go to the doctor tomorrow.
[362:25.17]Yeah, maybe.
[362:25.67]No, I'm fine.
[362:29.96]Anyways, that's going to be it.
[362:35.74]So I... Not 100% positive about this.
[362:39.50]There is probably going to be a stream tomorrow.
[362:44.87]Depending on if I can get this all set up.
[362:51.51]I don't know how long that will be, or maybe I won't.
[362:55.92]I don't know.
[362:57.38]It depends on how this whole thing gets set up.
[363:01.54]I'm not sure.
[363:02.14]I was invited to play Terraria with Mr. Star.
[363:08.02]So I don't know if he's streaming it or if I'm going to turn on a stream.
[363:13.38]We might just play.
[363:14.33]I don't really know what's going to happen.
[363:21.83]So I really don't know.
[363:23.73]Because I usually do three days on and then a few days off.
[363:27.51]I do usually two or three days on and then two or three days off.
[363:30.61]So tomorrow is very tentative to I really have no idea.
[363:34.12]If there is a stream tomorrow, it'll be kind of random.
[363:37.38]There's no time tomorrow.
[363:39.64]If it's like, oh, hey, it's set up and the server works and everything works fine and it's like 6 o'clock or something Pacific, then I'll just turn it on or something.
[363:47.73]So I don't really have a time frame for tomorrow.
[363:51.31]I have no idea.
[363:53.67]Just whenever it happens, if it happens, there you go.
[364:00.78]There is still the possibility that... Because the last thing that Star said was... We need to get, like, some mod thing.
[364:11.27]And that was it.
[364:12.19]I don't know if it... Maybe there'll be... Server issues.
[364:16.33]I don't know.
[364:18.05]It might happen.
[364:21.54]Should be interesting regardless.
[364:26.72]But... I will see you probably tomorrow.
[364:32.46]Take care, everybody.
[364:33.66]Good to see you.
[364:37.16]We are going to go back to six hours ago.
[364:44.52]Should be pretty quick tonight for the bits.
[364:50.26]Thank you for joining me on some of the... Sometimes these MS-DOS games are just so all over the place.
[364:58.43]I love doing this.
[365:00.86]Sometimes you can get a little fucked up and you have to, you know, change and shit.
[365:05.32]But it's such a wild list and a wild amount of different things to see.
[365:10.50]So, I love doing it.
[365:14.65]But, let's go back to earlier this evening.
[365:21.05]Hasnain, thanks for the $15.10.
[365:22.97]Hasnain.
[365:26.41]Just admit it, you are a closet weeb.
[365:30.29]I told you I watch one anime a year.
[365:33.79]Last year was One Punch Man.
[365:36.18]But this year, um... I don't know.
[365:45.16]But thank you for the $15.
[365:46.02]Not JoJo.
[365:52.94]I don't think it's gonna be JoJo.
[366:00.56]Full Metal Alchemist.
[366:01.54]I already saw that one.
[366:07.33]Watch JoJo so the green screens can make sense.
[366:11.24]Maybe.
[366:13.60]But thank you for the $15, Half Noon.
[366:16.20]It's time for Slime.
[366:16.90]Thanks for the $3.
[366:17.70]Glad you're finally coming back to DOS.
[366:20.12]Guess it's time to make Jerma DOS 2 video.
[366:24.04]Well, the first one was unbelievable.
[366:25.66]It was really funny.
[366:27.70]So, if there's enough over the next few weeks of content to do it, then hell yeah.
[366:36.65]First one was awesome.
[366:38.81]Fake me home.
[366:39.29]Thanks for the $2.50.
[366:40.01]Jerma, pretend like the next sentence in this message doesn't exist.
[366:45.11]There is...
[366:46.90]Oh, okay.
[366:47.62]Oh, there's nothing there.
[366:50.51]There's nothing there, though.
[366:51.47]So how would I pretend if there is nothing there?
[366:55.73]Uh... Thank you, Cult of Personality, for the 250.
[366:59.14]German, just press the turbo button on your DOS computer.
[367:02.82]Should've thought about that.
[367:03.84]You're right.
[367:05.70]I should've thought about that.
[367:06.48]Damn.
[367:08.99]Hey Gnarly, thanks for the 250.
[367:11.61]So when is the next League of Legends stream?
[367:13.43]I love watching your pro gameplay and hearing your strategies for the game.
[367:19.09]Um... You just snapped a memory into my brain.
[367:23.17]I made a grandpa video where I walked into towers in League of Legends.
[367:28.14]It's the only time I think I've ever opened the client of that game.
[367:33.46]Does that still exist?
[367:41.29]Did I upload that on my channel or was that on an old Machinima channel years ago?
[367:55.14]Because I know the whole Grandpa Call of Duty stuff all were... I think they were all deleted.
[368:03.34]Yeah, they were all completely wiped out.
[368:07.74]Watch it on stream?
[368:08.56]No, I'm not gonna watch that video on stream.
[368:11.86]I'm not watching that on stream.
[368:14.70]Not gonna happen.
[368:17.84]But... Maybe, okay, put it in the queue.
[368:24.22]Put it in the queue for... The video, Community Night.
[368:32.10]I would do it then.
[368:37.28]Watch it on stream.
[368:40.49]You'll see it eventually.
[368:42.42]But, thank you.
[368:45.03]I think I was playing as a little... Who's the little mummy?
[368:47.13]The little mummy character?
[368:54.71]Mu?
[368:55.43]Amumu?
[368:56.71]What's his name?
[368:59.05]Amumu.
[369:00.51]Amumu?
[369:03.70]Yeah.
[369:05.24]How do I remember this?
[369:06.12]Somehow.
[369:11.06]Somehow.
[369:13.91]But thank you to Swiggity Swanky for the five bucks.
[369:17.07]I'm not sure if you still follow TF2 anymore, but there's been this bug in older crates where players are unlocking rare, unusual, as common as dirt items.
[369:26.81]And the hat economy is crashing.
[369:29.81]And we talked about it in the very beginning of the stream.
[369:32.09]Right when it turned on, actually.
[369:34.03]If you were not here, I kind of gave my thoughts on it.
[369:35.95]They'll patch it.
[369:37.77]They'll probably rewind everything.
[369:41.83]And it'll be like as if it never happened.
[369:45.43]And if that doesn't happen, then who has any idea what's going to happen after that?
[369:59.43]It's being called the Crate Depression.
[370:02.43]Oh, God.
[370:06.79]Of course it is.
[370:10.77]But it's an interesting scenario.
[370:12.59]I wonder how it'll play out in the long run.
[370:14.57]I'm sure it'll be already fixed and patched by probably this time tomorrow.
[370:21.09]But thank you for the $5.
[370:23.38]Interesting stuff.
[370:27.84]Thank you, Niall Orion, for the $3.
[370:30.20]I didn't expect to end up laughing till I cry at a fucking game of Scrabble.
[370:35.06]Take my bits and shut up.
[370:40.37]That was all over the place.
[370:42.41]It was all over the place.
[370:46.15]But it was great fun.
[370:48.51]As it always is.
[370:50.02]All these games have their own little weird charms to them.
[370:56.36]But thank you for the three bucks.
[370:58.06]Glad you had a good time.
[371:00.48]The Great Lord Walden, thanks for the five dollars.
[371:02.88]They say life is pain.
[371:05.78]P-Pain.
[371:06.78]Life is pain.
[371:09.40]P-E.
[371:10.24]Life is pain.
[371:13.31]Thank you for that.
[371:16.81]Let's get the credits rolling.
[371:20.41]Here they come.
[371:22.31]Thank you for all the subs, all the resubs, all the community subs, everybody.
[371:29.50]There were a couple of random gifted subs tonight.
[371:34.12]Much love to you.
[371:38.80]I may or may not see you tomorrow.
[371:41.61]If it doesn't happen tomorrow, then I'm sure we'll probably rain check it if there's an issue.
[371:47.99]Maybe I'll see you tomorrow.
[371:48.57]But we're going to finish up the bits.
[371:52.31]We have $4.44 from Freudian Weapon.
