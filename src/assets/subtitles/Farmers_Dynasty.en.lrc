[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.91]Good afternoon!
[00:02.57]How are you doing, everybody?
[00:05.35]I hope you're doing good.
[00:12.76]Wait, hold on, hold on.
[00:15.24]My microphone's not here.
[00:17.06]Hold on, my microphone's... I cleaned up my office, like, you remember.
[00:21.36]My microphone's, like, in a different place.
[00:22.98]Wait.
[00:53.38]I was wondering.
[00:53.92]I was like, I can see my voice over there, but it looks very low.
[00:59.62]It still does.
[01:00.28]I fucked it up.
[01:17.92]Is that better?
[01:18.38]I think that's better.
[01:20.02]Alright, okay.
[01:20.54]Anyways.
[01:21.24]Hi guys, welcome to the stream.
[01:24.80]Uh... Yes, I know, I know.
[01:27.90]The only thing anybody can talk about right now is... Dude, that Half-Life trailer.
[01:38.02]I know.
[01:38.36]I know.
[01:40.56]I haven't even seen it yet.
[01:42.02]I haven't watched it, and I'm not going to.
[01:54.26]I'm kidding!
[01:54.90]Alright, alright, I haven't seen the trailer.
[01:58.76]So I was thinking, you know, what if we like do a little bit of watch the video and react to it, you know?
[02:03.84]Like, that's what I'm gonna do.
[02:06.38]We're gonna get a live, real reaction of not seeing the trailer.
[02:11.69]The trailer's like a minute and 15 seconds long, so it's not like we'll be here for a very long time.
[02:17.45]And also, what we're doing today...
[02:21.54]I gotta take a step back.
[02:23.77]Because think about the last week or so of streams.
[02:27.03]Dead Rising... It was just stressful.
[02:31.09]Dead Rising 2, super stressful.
[02:33.07]Beat the game time limits and all that shit.
[02:36.23]Sekiro, like a year ago.
[02:38.74]I'm still feeling that one.
[02:40.68]I want to slow down a little.
[02:44.16]Bombo was stressful.
[02:45.04]Exactly, that's what I'm saying.
[02:47.30]So, we're going to play Farmer's Dynasty.
[02:52.55]I was gonna play Hand Simulator, but everybody made fun of me in the pre-stream chat.
[03:00.33]I was like, people were just making fun of me, so I was like, okay, I guess I'm not gonna play that one.
[03:09.91]And yes, I am aware that this is not, this is not like Farming Simulator 2019.
[03:14.99]This is Farmer's Dynasty.
[03:18.91]It just released on Steam.
[03:21.92]So... I don't know.
[03:24.56]I just... I said it because I was being a dick.
[03:29.38]And I was like, oh, I'm thinking about playing Hand Simulator.
[03:31.61]Everyone's like, hey, if you're Tuber, okay, Tuber.
[03:33.93]Whoa, that's stupid.
[03:34.75]That game sucks, meme.
[03:36.47]And I was like, alright, fine.
[03:37.49]Farmer's Dynasty.
[03:38.59]And all of a sudden, you know what happens.
[03:44.74]Yeah, yeah, do that, yeah!
[03:46.44]Yeah!
[03:56.21]So, if you guys have not figured it out yet, pre-stream chat has a lot, you know, there's a lot of influence when I'm in that pre-stream chat.
[04:10.97]There are like at least a couple hundred one-guy scenarios.
[04:14.27]You want to be the one guy?
[04:16.65]Go to the pre-stream chat when I'm just hanging out for 20-30 minutes before the stream.
[04:22.85]You get like a buff to your one-guy influence in the pre-stream chat.
[04:31.58]But anyways, let's watch this trailer.
[04:37.10]Well, that's not the trailer, but I'm going to put it over that.
[04:43.01]Wait, are we going to be able to hear... I'm going to have to turn the music down here.
[04:48.95]No, there's no music.
[04:49.61]Alright, that's fine.
[04:51.43]Give me a second.
[04:51.97]Alright, let's watch it.
[04:53.03]Let's see it.
[04:53.47]I want to see it.
[04:54.81]I haven't seen it.
[04:58.78]Put on facecam?
[04:59.82]I do not have a shirt on, so I'm not going to put on facecam.
[05:02.10]Not going to happen.
[05:08.90]Alright, I got the YouTube link.
[05:11.10]This is the right one, right?
[05:12.52]Okay, here's the problem.
[05:13.50]Whenever you have a game like this come out...
[05:16.91]You know how many random potential Half-Life fan-made trailers there are?
[05:22.27]Half-Life!
[05:23.71]Alex Vance!
[05:25.27]Somebody could have made this as a machinima.
[05:28.37]There's a lot of them.
[05:28.93]I gotta make sure I got the right one.
[05:39.60]This is the right one, right?
[05:42.76]I haven't fucking seen this.
[05:44.08]What the hell is that?
[05:45.81]Who's breathing?
[05:46.83]Is this part of the trailer?
[05:50.45]No, no, no, no!
[05:51.37]No, don't start it yet!
[05:52.19]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[05:57.14]Fuck.
[05:58.24]Alright, hold on.
[05:58.82]Everyone slow down.
[05:59.50]Hold on.
[06:04.56]Wait, everybody wait.
[06:06.26]I blew it.
[06:07.14]I actually did blow it.
[06:18.87]Okay, here we go.
[06:20.80]I haven't seen this.
[06:21.60]Why is closed captioning on?
[06:25.66]Is this HD?
[06:28.40]Why is this 360p?
[06:32.54]1440p.
[06:33.00]I can't do it.
[06:33.78]My computer can't handle that.
[06:34.82]Alright, here we go.
[06:36.60]I'm ready.
[06:37.94]Three, two.
[06:42.00]Three, two, one, go.
[06:51.54]I can turn the volume up.
[06:54.57]Three, two, one.
[07:21.91]I'm here.
[07:23.43]So what's the plan?
[07:24.13]If we can get this weapon, what we're doing here could change things forever.
[07:30.49]There's no straight shot to the vault.
[07:33.69]Electricity!
[07:34.63]Electricity!
[07:35.59]Oh, more electricity!
[07:38.13]I'm with you every step of the way.
[07:40.60]Old guy!
[07:41.56]You're gonna need a gun!
[07:42.90]Don't worry, it's unloaded.
[07:46.06]It's unloaded now!
[07:55.15]nice that looks cool they've got dad they're gonna find out what he knows and then they're gonna kill him
[08:13.11]All this is my fault.
[08:14.71]I never told you.
[08:16.09]I couldn't.
[08:16.43]I'm so sorry, baby.
[08:17.99]You will not save him.
[08:19.59]Alex Vance alone cannot predict his fate.
[08:23.61]Close your eyes, honey!
[08:24.75]Electricity!
[08:38.83]Oh!
[08:45.10]Sweat is pouring down my fucking underarms right now.
[08:48.19]My underarms are crying.
[08:55.48]Yeah, I know.
[08:56.58]I can't believe it.
[08:58.20]I can't believe they got the default skin from Garry's Mod.
[09:01.96]Wow.
[09:03.00]I can't wait to play this.
[09:09.36]VR only?
[09:10.32]What?
[09:10.78]What the fuck?
[09:12.80]That looks... I don't know.
[09:14.50]There's a lot of electricity.
[09:15.40]A lot of electric moves.
[09:16.70]A lot of electric puzzles.
[09:23.01]I don't know.
[09:23.57]It looks good.
[09:25.17]It looks like it could be good.
[09:26.25]It looks like it could be funny and interesting.
[09:28.01]And the weapons look really great.
[09:37.03]The way that you load the guns and everything.
[09:38.71]It's that new controller.
[09:40.19]It's going to be the new Knuckles controller.
[09:43.06]And like I'm going to have to get them.
[09:44.62]Because how would you not get them?
[09:50.30]We'll see.
[09:50.86]And apparently I've been told that.
[09:54.96]This is a full video game.
[09:56.34]This is not just like a 3 hour Knuckles tech demo.
[10:00.31]Right?
[10:04.07]So this is like a 12 to 15 hour game.
[10:05.69]That's the first time that's ever happened.
[10:09.46]I don't think there has been a VR game that's, like, a full VR experience that's been more than, like, four or five hours.
[10:19.83]Resident Evil 7 now?
[10:20.83]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10:23.27]I'm talking a only VR.
[10:25.51]Only, only, only VR only.
[10:28.99]Not Resident Evil 7.
[10:32.02]Resident Evil 7 was a game you could play on your PlayStation.
[10:34.40]On your Xbox.
[10:36.40]VR only.
[10:40.04]Skyrim.
[10:40.62]Did somebody just say Skyrim?
[10:43.54]Yeah, okay, so on the ninth time they released that game, you could play it in VR.
[10:47.88]No, I'm talking ground-up VR only.
[10:52.30]You couldn't play Resident Evil 7 VR only.
[10:56.03]In fact, you could only play it on PlayStation VR for the first, like, six months.
[11:01.79]Everybody on PC played that with keyboard and mouse.
[11:07.11]Rick and Morty.
[11:12.58]Fucking Rick and Morty?
[11:18.76]Rick and Morty is like a four-hour game.
[11:22.11]It'll be nice to see that, though.
[11:23.63]I'm looking forward to it.
[11:27.33]Alright, so let's see.
[11:28.35]What's the internet have to say about this?
[11:29.83]What does the internet think?
[11:34.60]Uh, we got 155,000 likes and 4.2 thousand dislikes.
[11:41.42]So 4,200 dislikes, 155,000 likes.
[11:45.12]Seems like people are taking it pretty well.
[11:49.12]The internet thinks you should play Farmer's Dynasty.
[11:55.50]Are you sure?
[11:57.82]If I had a like and dislike ratio on this stream, the second that this trailer comes down would probably be like 30 to 70% like to dislike.
[12:09.01]So I don't know if you're correct on that.
[12:12.01]I think you're actually incorrect.
[12:17.13]Just wait.
[12:17.71]You guys are going to just wait.
[12:19.07]I think I picked a good one.
[12:20.74]Alright, let's go.
[12:22.68]That was cool.
[12:23.68]I'm sure it'll be fun.
[12:27.42]They wouldn't have waited this long and put this much time into it if it wasn't gonna be at least a fun game.
[12:34.61]We'll find out.
[12:36.71]When I play it on day one, that's right, I've got an announcement of my own!
[12:41.17]On day one of the launch of Half-Life VR, I'm gonna play it on this channel.
[12:49.14]What an announcement that I have for you, right?
[12:52.32]The thing that somebody put tons of awesome time into, I'm gonna play it.
[12:59.65]What a fucking announcement.
[13:03.41]Oh shit, this is loud.
[13:07.14]Upgrade my PC.
[13:10.98]By then, I'll have at least another fucking 780.
[13:12.80]You guys ready?
[13:17.48]Can we go now?
[13:20.97]Day one, first minute?
[13:24.53]No, there's no way I'm going to be the first person that plays that game.
[13:29.24]Somebody from, like, fucking Russia will have, like, a leaked copy two, three weeks before, and it'll stream it for, like, 40 minutes before they get removed.
[13:37.68]So I won't be the first person that plays it.
[13:43.21]When I'm allowed to, I will.
[13:52.16]You guys ready?
[13:58.49]Move to Russia.
[14:03.51]Some random person from like, I don't know, like Australia or something will end up having like a copy from some Australian GameStop.
[14:14.87]New quest.
[14:15.95]Talk to Oliver.
[14:16.87]Since your grandfather passed away, he has kept an eye on your farm.
[14:20.10]He'll show you a row.
[14:20.78]That's a bomb you're dropping on me.
[14:24.40]You're losing food from the pantry.
[14:25.98]A cat should keep mice at bay.
[14:28.78]First my grandfather dies and now my cat's... What's going on?
[14:31.94]Hold on.
[14:34.88]Uh, this is... The sensitivity is too high.
[14:40.46]That's controller sensitivity.
[14:46.33]Wait.
[14:47.01]Is there a... Controls.
[14:51.54]Keyboard.
[14:54.66]Change the currency.
[14:55.58]I already did.
[14:59.68]Alright, we got... I might have to... Oh, damn it.
[15:13.78]Game already sucks.
[15:15.46]Not a silent protagonist.
[15:16.79]Why am I dressed like this then?
[15:18.11]Why does he not have the belt?
[15:20.01]Why do we keep doing the T-pose stretch?
[15:23.23]Hold on.
[15:47.87]That's a little better.
[15:49.11]Field of view, best quality, let's go.
[15:51.29]Okay, follow Oliver.
[15:56.38]Alright, where's like the, where's the punch?
[16:03.80]How do you, I want to walk.
[16:06.46]No, that's sprint.
[16:08.00]I think I might actually use a controller for this.
[16:09.62]This kind of, is a little painful.
[16:12.57]Is V-Sync on?
[16:15.77]No, I gotta turn it on.
[16:19.34]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[16:20.86]I don't want it in a different language.
[16:26.10]Holy shit, you've got it.
[16:27.18]This has been localized in a shitload of places.
[16:39.04]What the hell have you been doing?
[16:40.08]I thought you were looking after this place.
[16:42.49]Does that include eating Cheetos on the couch while the place rots?
[16:47.26]but you can have some sleep here perhaps or even store some food you will have to bring this farm to a good shape yourself soon you'll see how to do it follow me this place sucks what did you what like what did you have you said has it been living here
[17:14.54]So he inherited this farm.
[17:15.94]Why didn't I get this farm?
[17:17.34]Well, I'll take a full letter group.
[17:19.36]Okay.
[17:20.06]His farm, your problem.
[17:20.88]Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[17:47.42]That's the guy from How It's Made.
[17:49.86]It really is.
[17:51.06]I hope he tells me.
[17:52.46]Imagine if he stands behind you while you work.
[17:55.64]And he just narrates what you're doing.
[18:17.94]The farmer screws the nails into the board.
[18:20.52]Oh, I hope that happens.
[18:29.41]It's like, Oliver, will you fuck off?
[18:30.83]The cow shed is old and needs some work.
[18:34.13]But it's still solid.
[18:35.95]You can do the fixes and upgrades yourself.
[18:38.82]Try fixing those holes first.
[18:40.76]The cow shed?
[18:43.28]What holes?
[18:44.10]I see you've come prepared and have your own tools.
[18:48.00]Good.
[18:48.88]Try to fix these doors since it's stuck and won't open.
[18:53.34]Okay, hold on.
[18:54.24]This game is like... I need V-Sync turned on.
[18:59.21]Because it's killing me.
[19:04.49]I think I have to restart the game.
[19:06.57]We'll get to a save point first.
[19:07.75]Alright.
[19:08.37]Equip the repair tool from the work mode menu.
[19:10.61]Check the barn for sections.
[19:11.83]Okay, the work mode menu.
[19:12.89]Is this an open world game?
[19:20.22]Why do I have a Grand Theft Auto map?
[19:22.36]Are you serious?
[19:27.50]Okay, I need a...
[19:33.14]Barn.
[19:33.56]Your animals live here.
[19:34.42]Keep this building in good shape so that your animals grow healthy.
[19:38.98]Oh.
[19:39.08]Okay.
[19:40.10]Engineer's site.
[19:47.09]Open activate.
[19:49.55]Repair old planks.
[19:57.77]Alright.
[19:58.97]It should open now.
[20:03.11]I already opened it.
[20:07.37]The door, I opened it already.
[20:09.01]Why did I have to do that?
[20:13.94]Wow, look at this.
[20:15.98]Don't tell me what vegetable it is.
[20:18.56]That's wheat.
[20:20.10]Got it.
[20:21.50]Build a... Access the scaffold to from the work mode menu.
[20:32.97]This?
[20:33.83]Build a scaffolding.
[20:42.24]Holy shit, that took no time at all.
[20:44.78]That was instantaneous.
[20:46.46]I'm carrying this?
[20:47.74]Alright, I'm up.
[21:01.27]Is this, I'm just, is this Fortnite?
[21:03.77]Real life Fortnite.
[21:05.29]Should I just make a shitload of them?
[21:07.21]No, if it was real life Fortnite, guys, it'd be like this.
[21:10.55]Fuck, what are you saying?
[21:15.72]Fuck me.
[21:16.70]I almost got hit by that.
[21:17.92]Alright.
[21:20.16]If it was real life Fortnite, it would be this.
[21:27.08]I can only have two out at one time.
[21:28.20]Never mind.
[21:28.56]How do I remove this?
[21:33.55]Whatever, we can have two.
[21:34.25]Alright, what are you going to do?
[21:35.75]Fuck me!
[21:39.77]I'm sorry.
[21:40.35]Okay.
[21:40.57]Repair rusty metal.
[22:04.28]Do I need more pieces?
[22:08.76]I think I did it.
[22:10.58]Oh.
[22:18.09]What is going on here?
[22:20.71]You can grow some veggies here fast to earn some quick money.
[22:24.95]Shave the back of his head.
[22:26.59]You'll have to fix these holes so your plants can grow to a best effect.
[22:33.42]Okay, fix these holes.
[22:34.76]There's a car over there.
[22:37.38]Wait.
[22:37.56]Okay.
[22:37.68]Pick up metal?
[22:38.16]Steal sheets to fix it?
[22:39.04]It was already gone.
[22:39.94]Did somebody read that?
[22:40.70]Rebuild rusty metal with metal.
[22:41.90]I've
[23:04.18]Wait, we're only gonna do the door?
[23:05.41]Okay, I'm done.
[23:12.25]You're pretty good at this.
[23:14.07]I'm sure you'll do well on this farm.
[23:17.43]Actually, I might have a job for you myself.
[23:21.25]Hmm, what is it?
[23:23.65]Why don't you come to my place and do some fixes to my barn?
[23:27.34]It's mostly roof that needs work, but some walls need attention too.
[23:33.40]I don't have much money, but I'll give you my old tractor as a reward.
[23:37.74]I'm sure you can use it.
[23:41.18]Stop.
[23:42.06]Wait, there's dialog options?
[23:43.52]Alright, sounds good.
[23:44.40]I'll take care of that.
[23:45.27]Thanks.
[23:45.83]Should I go to his place?
[23:47.13]Yeah.
[23:47.65]Sounds good.
[23:48.49]I'll take care of this.
[23:50.33]I love this game already.
[23:52.67]Alright.
[23:53.73]I'm going back home now.
[23:55.73]Good luck and see you around.
[24:03.96]What the fuck do I do now?
[24:08.52]You received a thousand social points.
[24:10.44]Alright, I'm kind of lost.
[24:18.69]I've got a really important job for you.
[24:20.61]Why don't you come to my place?
[24:24.41]The way that I'm, like, dressed to...
[24:33.25]I'm dressed in like a Halloween costume repairman costume.
[24:38.03]What's in here?
[24:38.53]This is my house, right?
[24:49.51]What the fuck is all this stuff?
[24:56.32]Enter the pantry.
[24:59.94]Oh.
[25:01.92]Italian tomato soup cooked or condensed food tasty in... Do I have to eat?
[25:06.32]Is this even doing anything?
[25:19.47]Holy shit, imagine playing the game.
[25:21.03]What is this FOV slider?
[25:24.57]Let's go right in the middle where it starts.
[25:29.62]Oh my god.
[25:40.22]What?
[25:40.48]What?
[25:40.74]What?
[25:41.00]What?
[25:41.30]What?
[25:41.64]What?
[25:41.98]What's going on?
[25:42.58]He doesn't know.
[25:43.06]He didn't know.
[25:46.48]What's wrong?
[25:56.61]Why even have an FOV option that goes down this far?
[25:59.31]Who plays a game like this?
[26:02.79]Why wouldn't you have the option to go up rather than down this far?
[26:09.05]Alright, well, at max FOV, this is definitely like 60.
[26:11.79]Is this 90?
[26:14.67]I don't think it is.
[26:15.21]Whatever.
[26:16.35]Alright, what's wrong?
[26:19.55]Alright, I gotta go to the guy's house.
[26:21.31]Right?
[26:23.01]Home sweet home.
[26:23.63]Complete repairs on your farm.
[26:24.95]Help Oliver.
[26:26.11]Go to Oliver's farm and fix his barn.
[26:28.15]Use engineer's site to see which sections of the barn need repairs.
[26:31.33]Let's go there.
[26:31.83]Is that my truck?
[26:52.28]Are there police?
[26:53.21]No.
[27:05.05]Hello, I'm John.
[27:06.86]I'm the tradesman here.

[27:11.60]What's your trade?
[27:13.60]A bit of everything.

[27:19.55]What about hamburgers?
[27:20.59]Where am I?
[27:21.13]Oh, okay.
[27:21.41]You notice a stranger by the road.
[27:23.89]He clearly wants something.
[27:24.79]Wait, what?
[27:56.57]Wait, I want to sell you stuff.
[27:58.27]Come here.
[27:58.49]Care to trade.
[28:00.53]Here, I've got a hamburger.
[28:04.45]Delicious food of great nutritional value.

[28:59.73]Is there a chainsaw?
[29:13.35]How do I equip the chainsaw?
[29:22.86]Okay, put it away, put it away.
[29:24.16]Put it away.
[29:27.79]Let's go.
[29:28.19]I need to do my quest.
[29:29.35]I haven't even started playing the game yet.
[29:32.62]I have to play the game.
[29:37.42]What is that?
[29:37.76]Is that an animal?
[29:41.80]Buy a ring from him and then propose to him.
[29:49.70]Can you pet?
[29:52.91]Can I feed the dog?
[30:02.15]I don't think so.
[30:02.65]Alright, let's go.
[30:10.98]Get in the fucking truck and just drive the damn thing, for Christ's... Okay.
[30:22.63]This is... Where is Oliver's house?
[30:28.93]Can I put a waypoint?
[30:31.52]Go to Oliver's farm and fix his barn.
[30:32.86]Alright, I have a waypoint there.
[30:35.62]I think.
[30:35.92]There we go.
[30:50.41]Somebody else's farm.
[30:51.43]I'm just driving over all this stuff.
[30:54.13]Aw, dammit.
[30:58.71]Change camera?
[31:00.74]Can I go?
[31:01.18]Oh, I can go inside.
[31:06.61]Destroy the competition.
[31:08.75]There can only be one farmer in this town.
[31:12.21]You're destroying strangers' crops.
[31:13.71]It's bad for your social status.
[31:15.27]Is this Oliver's house?
[31:25.06]Wait, this is Oliver's barn.
[31:26.22]Fuck Oliver.
[31:34.95]You let my grandfather's place go to shit.
[31:36.87]You think I care?
[31:37.53]Alright, what do I need to fix?
[31:41.51]I'm coming over here with like a huge tractor and I'm gonna just dig up all of his stuff and steal it.
[31:52.28]Have I already gone full-blown psycho?
[31:57.93]Where's his barn?
[32:05.72]Oliver, where the fuck are you?
[32:14.94]Is this where he lives?
[32:16.00]I'm just like this sicko cutting his shit down.
[32:36.52]Just block the road.
[32:38.32]Well, he'll figure it out.
[32:39.16]Alright, where is Oliver?
[32:42.24]You notice a lady by her farm.
[32:43.58]Perhaps it would be nice to say hello.
[32:48.30]This lady?
[32:48.90]I don't understand what this game wants me to do.
[32:53.50]I'm trying to find- Propose.
[33:07.25]I need one of my fields plowed and cultivated.
[33:09.77]Will you do it for me, please?
[33:12.22]Use that old plow over there by the barn.
[33:14.50]You can keep it when you're done.
[33:15.40]Alright, I'll do it.
[33:16.02]My brother plans on buying a new one anyway.
[33:17.62]I can keep this.
[33:18.52]Okay, I'm going to keep this.
[33:19.22]I get a new thing.
[33:19.66]No promises, but I'll see what I can do.
[33:21.30]Alright, where... The quest is being fought.
[33:26.70]Attach the old plow to work on Clara's field.
[33:32.69]Alright, it's here.
[33:34.32]But... I... Okay, let's mark it.
[33:37.86]It's already being marked.
[33:41.24]Do I need my truck for this?
[33:42.10]I think I need to back my truck into that.
[33:59.73]Yeah, I gotta back up my truck into that.
[34:01.09]Alright, I got my truck.
[34:19.37]Wheels are off the ground.
[34:24.60]Sorry about that Okay, back the truck up into this somehow
[34:48.62]Other way?
[35:03.47]You can't do this with a truck?
[35:12.92]Attach.
[35:21.27]Didn't I try to go in here?
[35:25.62]Oh, shit.
[35:27.44]There's no tractor in here, you guys.
[35:28.92]There's nothing in here.
[35:35.31]Where's your tractor?
[35:42.27]In my barn?
[35:47.51]Well, you fix this and then they give you a tractor.
[35:50.87]Wait, I have to just plug the holes?
[35:52.59]Alright.
[36:14.73]I did it.
[36:15.03]I can use my farm revision.
[36:20.31]Farming's really easy.
[36:29.25]Attach the old plow to work.
[36:31.16]The quest is being fought.
[36:32.40]Attach the old plow to work.
[36:36.94]Complete repairs.
[36:41.74]Am I just dumb, or do I not have a tractor?
[36:44.33]Do I have to get a tractor?
[36:47.23]Do I have to, like, fix up the rest of this barn?
[36:54.21]Yes, but you do need a tractor.
[36:56.30]Okay, so... You get it from... Alright, well, we're gonna come back here later.
[37:03.12]Oliver first.
[37:04.10]I need to repair my own place first.
[37:06.87]Is there a horn?
[37:07.45]If there's not a horn, it's the worst game.
[37:12.61]See you later.
[37:14.61]Oh, you both don't like me.
[37:20.46]Bye.
[37:20.76]Alright, so, I need to go... I need to, like, save the game first, and then, like, restart with VSync on.
[37:32.75]Yeah, okay, there we go.
[37:36.63]Saving the game.
[37:37.25]Am I good?
[37:39.51]Am I good?
[37:43.33]Alright.
[37:43.71]Yeah.
[37:43.89]Let me just... Vsync has to be turned on.
[37:45.75]This is, like, killing me.
[37:48.03]My credit sucks.
[37:48.97]It'll improve very shortly.
[37:52.35]No, it's not on.
[37:52.87]I have to restart the game.
[37:55.89]I have to restart the game.
[37:58.82]It'll be turned on.
[37:59.38]Here we go.
[38:00.06]One, two, three.
[38:02.86]You want to leave?
[38:03.58]Yes.
[38:05.34]Is this, like, actually an iPad game ad?
[38:08.36]Where, like, I accidentally click on yes and take me to this person's Discord?
[38:18.97]That's kind of... Alright, whatever.
[38:20.21]Alright, let's, uh... Let's reopen it, and then we can go.
[38:24.40]I have to turn on V-Sync, otherwise the game's gonna keep hurting my eyes.
[38:27.68]Alright, load game.
[38:41.33]Wait, what's going on here?
[38:42.13]Why is it so tiny?
[38:44.42]Vsync on.
[38:45.08]1920x1080.
[38:45.12]What the fuck is this?
[38:46.82]Why is this in such a tiny window?
[38:55.73]What is going on here?
[38:59.39]Why does it look normal for you but look awful for me?
[39:16.67]I mean, that definitely plays, but why is it in such a tiny, it's in a small window.
[39:23.66]Vsync off, what do you mean Vsync off?
[39:27.10]No, Vsync on, 1920 by 1080.
[39:31.26]What are you doing?
[39:34.57]Windowed off, 1920 by 1080, let's go, come on.
[39:38.83]It's in like a 1200 by, it's in like a 720 window on my desktop.
[39:50.74]What the fuck is this?
[39:51.66]Okay, is it doing this shit again?
[39:57.56]Why is it in a window?
[39:58.58]I have no idea what's going on.
[40:05.31]Save the settings.
[40:06.07]What do you mean save the settings?
[40:11.91]Alt enter.
[40:12.55]Alright, we're good.
[40:15.49]Alright, let's go.
[40:17.75]No family, pretty good condition.
[40:19.41]I'm ready to go.
[40:21.19]That was fucked up.
[40:23.77]There's no save settings.
[40:26.51]Guys, there's no save settings.
[40:28.60]You have to restart the game to have your settings take place.
[40:39.88]Did that help?
[40:41.84]Yeah, it did.
[40:42.74]Alright, let's go back to, uh... Where are we going?
[40:49.37]I'm trying to go to Oliver.
[40:52.95]Fix Oliver's barn.
[40:59.89]That's how you mark it.
[41:00.73]I get it.
[41:01.07]Let's go.
[41:18.68]Am I running out of gas?
[41:19.74]Why am I going so slow?
[41:23.51]Why am I going so slow?
[41:31.73]That's a huge bird!
[41:34.05]That bird was like 10 feet tall.
[41:39.13]Alright Oliver, what do you need?
[41:44.73]I'm here to fix your barn.
[41:49.10]Ugh, yuck.
[41:50.98]Could use a lot of work, Oliver.
[41:56.05]Alright, Oliver, I'm here.
[41:57.25]I don't know what's going on this way, but can I pick that up?
[42:03.80]Alright, we've got it.
[42:04.78]Oof, broken.
[42:06.42]I'll fix it.
[42:13.32]That's that.
[42:14.70]Up there, too.
[42:15.31]Can I reach?
[42:18.19]Of course I can.
[42:23.44]What's that Minecraft hack that just builds in like 10, 15 blocks ahead of you?
[42:31.04]How do I... I gotta get on the roof and fix this roof.
[42:38.26]Oh, Oliver.
[42:41.26]Alright, we gotta get on the roof.
[42:42.22]Scaffolding time.
[42:55.49]Okay, let's repair this.
[42:56.47]Dude, pog.
[43:04.90]Let's go.
[43:05.48]Do I get social credit with this?
[43:18.42]I wonder what that means.
[43:23.00]Steel tractor.
[43:25.59]I'm probably gonna get one for this.
[43:30.46]This is gonna take a long fucking time.
[43:41.93]Imagine redoing somebody's entire barn, building it back, repairing everything for 50 likes on an Instagram post.
[43:56.19]I'm not so sure that's worth it.
[44:06.24]Okay, well that's almost the other side.
[44:09.00]It actually kind of feels nice to do this.
[44:20.47]Is there third person mode?
[44:23.95]No, of course there isn't.
[44:45.67]I'm not even doing my own house.
[44:51.95]I drank coffee so I wouldn't fall asleep today.
[44:54.36]Well, you've got two factors fighting back and forth.
[45:00.92]You've got farming Dynasty Stream and a bunch of coffee.
[45:05.66]You're being pulled in two different directions.
[45:11.81]I did it.
[45:13.23]Barn fix.
[45:13.67]Talk to Oliver and ask for your reward.
[45:15.57]Is it fall damage?
[45:16.31]Ooh!
[45:20.89]I'm gonna get that.
[45:21.57]That's mine.
[45:28.91]Oliver, I fixed the barn.
[45:31.66]Looking good and solid.
[45:33.78]Thank you.
[45:35.66]Now, I don't have much money, but as promised, that John Deere over there is all yours.
[45:41.88]Uh, they try- You said the copyrighted name.
[45:46.82]You were supposed to not say the copyright name.
[45:54.90]You should talk to people.
[45:56.62]I'm sure a lot of them will have some work for you too.
[46:00.40]You'll need a plow, a cedar perhaps, and I've seen a cultivator already on your farm.
[46:06.53]Good luck with farming.
[46:09.01]I will look around.
[46:10.13]Thank you.
[46:14.81]I just stole an apple.
[46:18.00]Okay, so, um... Drive your new Jack Bear tractor.
[46:23.06]Cool.
[46:23.16]I did.
[46:23.30]Alright, thanks for the tractor.
[46:45.30]Where are you going?
[46:50.39]Who is this person?
[46:51.39]And why are they sprinting?
[46:55.41]Not now, sorry.
[47:14.80]I'm curious.
[47:15.32]I need to know what you're doing.
[47:24.82]What?
[47:27.68]Where'd he go?
[47:32.46]Wait, did he go into the corn?
[47:34.94]Oh shit, he went into the corn!
[47:42.92]Uh-oh.
[47:43.20]Wait, I probably shouldn't have done this.
[47:45.96]There we go.
[47:46.36]Thank God I have a map.
[47:52.15]Well, that was weird.
[47:52.71]Alright, give me my tractor.
[48:01.41]I can purchase your field.
[48:03.61]So I'm just going to end up as a monopoly farm and own everything?
[48:21.69]Okay.
[48:24.37]You've received Jack, Bear, Sea, and 100 social points.
[48:30.01]Cool.
[48:30.89]Alright, now I can do Clara's job.
[48:32.49]That's the one we're going to do now.
[48:38.43]Okay, I don't really want to drive this.
[48:39.87]This is like driving around a giant unicycle.
[48:43.55]Or a giant tricycle.
[48:49.87]I don't want to lose social points.
[48:55.78]If that's four wheels, that don't matter.
[48:57.36]The two in the front maze will be one.
[48:58.72]99... I have to get gas too?
[49:22.16]Look at how big this bird is.
[49:23.86]Birds aren't that big.
[49:26.07]That thing was like a fucking bald eagle.
[49:37.20]Alright.
[49:37.52]I gotta attach this.
[50:00.85]How does it attach?
[50:04.93]I've never... I don't know what this thing is.
[50:25.63]He's a fucking city slicker.
[50:27.41]I... I...
[50:29.59]I don't know what the... I don't know how to do this.
[50:31.47]I don't know what this thing is.
[50:33.69]I know it's like a plow and there's blades on it and shit, but I don't know how to... Why can I not attach this?
[50:39.07]Did I have it before?
[50:46.54]There.
[50:46.70]Okay.
[50:46.90]Got it.
[50:48.14]Got it.
[50:49.94]Plow Clara's field.
[50:54.18]This one here.
[50:58.31]How do I use the plow?
[51:03.67]Yeah, you got nothing here, Clara.
[51:05.39]Why don't you plow your field?
[51:07.68]Drive over your sand?
[51:10.06]What is here?
[51:10.58]Am I doing this right?
[51:25.19]Oh, wait, wait, lower the machine, lower the machine.
[51:28.69]Oh, man.
[51:29.37]Okay, lift the machine.
[51:36.97]Wait, I gotta do this whole thing.
[51:43.43]Oh, boy.
[51:44.19]Oh, shit, I'm tearing up the whole world.
[51:48.57]Alright, let's do this quick.
[52:07.78]What do you mean?
[52:08.36]There is no quick?
[52:20.03]Alright, I almost did one pass.
[52:29.52]Alright, now he's gonna... I'm gonna just, like, mow in a lawn.
[52:39.12]Holy shit, this is gonna take like two hours.
[52:41.24]This is gonna take us so long.
[52:45.02]This is gonna take like an hour.
[52:51.74]This is absolutely nothing.
[52:54.70]This is how I mow lawns.
[52:57.64]I know everybody thinks I'm fucking crazy, but my father used to tell me,
[53:02.58]Son, I want you to get out there and I want you to mow the lawn.
[53:04.48]I'd be like, alright, fine.
[53:07.22]And I would just do it like this.
[53:08.56]So I would never have to stop moving.
[53:10.10]You don't have to stop, reverse, go back, stop.
[53:11.87]No, I would just go in a circle and a spiral.
[53:15.55]Until I got to the very end.
[53:28.22]Wait, slow down.
[53:28.72]Am I going too fast?
[53:36.93]I am going too fast.
[53:38.03]Fuck.
[53:39.54]Uh-oh, hold on.
[53:42.44]Don't go slower.
[53:45.94]I can't... Oh, there we go.
[53:54.66]Okay.
[53:55.50]What about... What is cruise control?
[53:57.38]Oh, it just drives it for you.
[53:58.62]Good.
[53:59.64]I'll do that.
[54:01.08]I want to change the camera, too.
[54:02.16]Let's, like, relax.
[54:07.49]That's way better.
[54:08.59]Alright.
[54:10.91]Now I can actually see what the fuck I'm doing.
[54:21.84]Right now they're all in the house preparing dinner looking out the window.
[54:26.26]At this.
[54:28.06]And they're just like, no, no, just let him do it.
[54:31.22]Let him do it that way.
[54:32.26]I mean, don't go out there and, like, correct him.
[54:36.14]He's kind of a weirdo.
[54:37.46]Just, like, let him do his thing.
[54:42.30]What's going on over there every time?
[54:53.29]Why can I not do that turn?
[54:54.61]What's wrong with me?
[55:07.19]I got plenty of gas.
[55:08.23]I have 95%.
[55:17.23]What's the issue here?
[55:18.33]What do I keep doing?
[55:33.02]Shit.
[55:33.42]Alright, I'll get it.
[55:33.88]I'm just gonna go backwards.
[55:35.84]Can you go backwards in a plot like this?
[55:37.64]No.
[55:48.45]Yeah, but this really is a scenario where somebody would just burst out their fucking back door and be like, Jeremy!
[55:54.55]Jeremy!
[55:54.86]Jeremy!
[55:55.14]Jeremy!
[55:55.62]Stop!
[55:55.86]Stop!
[55:56.16]Stop it!
[55:56.52]Stop!
[55:56.80]Stop!
[55:57.04]Stop!
[55:57.22]Stop!
[55:57.34]And it's like, what?
[55:58.56]What?
[55:58.78]What?
[55:59.06]Stop!
[55:59.38]Get off!
[56:00.14]Get off the fucking tractor!
[56:01.38]Get off!
[56:06.37]I'd be like, what's going on?
[56:07.09]What's the matter?
[56:07.51]What's the matter?
[56:08.05]I'd be really kind of nervous and kind of sad.
[56:10.05]Like, what's happening?
[56:12.73]Get off.
[56:13.23]Just go home.
[56:17.33]Thank you.
[56:18.01]Thank you.
[56:18.50]I appreciate the help.
[56:19.46]Thank you.
[56:20.20]Thank you so much.
[56:21.10]Thank you.
[56:21.42]But just get off.
[56:25.96]Leave.
[56:29.64]I can't do it.
[56:30.58]Yes, I can.
[56:44.93]I'm going to line up that back left wheel.
[57:03.99]Alright, I'm going to just... Here we go.
[57:05.55]I have a new plan.
[57:07.25]I can't use my old lawn mowing technique.
[57:17.86]Does it matter if you just go over?
[57:19.36]You are getting hungry.
[57:23.09]Okay.
[57:23.43]Do I have to eat?
[57:34.35]Just go over there and eat.
[57:35.39]Can I just walk over there?
[57:36.63]Alright, I'm hungry.
[57:38.56]Lunch break!
[57:43.40]Lunch break!
[57:45.10]Exit.
[57:58.21]Do I have any food?
[57:59.43]Oh, an apple.
[57:59.91]Here we go.
[58:00.99]Your condition.
[58:02.35]Your condition depends on both eating and sleeping.
[58:04.23]Keep your condition high to feel and work better.
[58:08.13]Food 44, sleep 63.
[58:10.54]What do you mean, sleep?
[58:12.30]Alright, unhitched it.
[58:21.33]Oops.
[58:32.93]They're looking out the window again.
[58:35.53]Yeah, he unhitched it.
[58:36.89]I mean, that thing was expensive.
[58:38.47]I just don't want him to break it.
[58:40.85]I'm going to go out there.
[58:41.63]I know I shouldn't go out there, but I'm going to go out there.
[58:44.78]Oh, he got it.
[58:45.20]He got it.
[58:45.44]Okay.
[58:45.54]I just don't want him to break it.
[58:46.60]Honey, I don't want him to break it.
[58:57.49]There's an argument going on in the living room over here.
[59:06.05]It's all my fault.
[59:09.74]Let me get this little section.
[59:23.16]Why is it so hard for me to do this?
[59:24.96]Because this thing turns.
[59:28.20]This thing, it's hard to control.
[59:33.34]It's not, it's hard.
[59:48.48]It's like, it's hard to turn on a dime.
[59:50.44]Look, it takes me a full... Ah, whatever.
[59:53.11]I don't care.
[60:14.76]Wait, press R. So I can turn better.
[60:28.02]Dragon the whole time alright They're not gonna be able to grow shit in this look at this that look at how bad that looks oh This does not look good This is a coloring book that you gave a four-year-old oh
[61:00.97]At least I'm staying inside the lines.
[61:02.75]But inside the lines is a joke.
[61:06.53]Strokes go in two or three different ways.
[61:08.33]I'm almost done.
[61:23.70]Look at how bumpy it is.
[61:28.31]It's so bumpy over there.
[61:31.44]It's not smooth at all.
[61:36.06]I've made dunes.
[61:41.44]Oh, this is very, very bad.
[61:42.92]Do I get in trouble if it's a bad job?
[61:45.00]Or is the game not smart enough to tell me that I did a bad job?
[62:23.10]Wait.
[62:26.06]Quest updated.
[62:26.91]To cultivate field, go for your own harrow.
[62:29.61]You'll find it by your barn.
[62:32.15]What do you mean cultivate?
[62:33.33]This is not cultivating.
[62:35.13]What is this doing?
[62:46.23]This is plowing.
[62:50.60]Alright.
[62:51.65]No, I gotta get that last piece.
[62:53.44]I have to.
[62:53.86]It's gonna kill me.
[63:01.50]I'm sorry, guys.
[63:02.68]But, yeah, City Boy, City Boy, LOL, Omega LOL, sure.
[63:05.98]You can do your Omega LOLs.
[63:08.04]If I grabbed my, like, my fucking 80-year-old grandfather, and I said, Hey, Grandpa, have you ever played a video game before in your life?
[63:16.93]No, not at all.
[63:17.89]Hey, beat Dark Souls right now in front of me.
[63:21.66]He'd be like, I don't even understand what this is.
[63:26.52]City Boy!
[63:40.13]I've never driven a plow before in my life.
[63:41.86]I don't even know what this thing is.
[63:47.42]Let's grind up the pavement.
[64:04.29]No, no, not the sunflowers!
[64:06.79]Those are expensive.
[64:08.99]What does it want me to do?
[64:14.66]What the fuck am I supposed to do with this?
[64:22.56]These are medieval torture devices.
[64:25.62]Honestly, if you had lined these up, right?
[64:28.75]Let's just say, for instance, that I had you blindfold, you take me to a space, you go into a warehouse, and you show me that on the ground.
[64:37.01]I'm gonna... Oh, what is that?
[64:39.42]I'm gonna say, oh, they put people on that in the medieval times, and they, like, stretched them out and, like, stabbed them and shit.
[64:47.28]I wouldn't know what the hell this was.
[64:48.36]Alright, I need to attach that.
[64:57.89]You have fixed... You have fixed your garage.
[65:03.21]Congratulations, your neighbors appreciate your work.
[65:04.71]You received 5,000 points.
[65:08.10]Somebody fixed my garage for me.
[65:12.72]And they didn't have the heart to tell me.
[65:15.16]Alright, I'm fucking up all my weed.
[65:17.36]How do I drop this thing?
[65:18.54]Drop it!
[65:18.96]Is this mine?
[65:32.72]Why would they put it here?
[65:35.63]People are just doing chores for me.
[65:38.63]I think people feel bad for me.
[65:46.34]Alright.
[65:47.32]Now bring it back.
[65:48.74]Go back to Clara and cultivate her field.
[65:52.74]Oh no.
[66:10.48]Cultivate the pavement.
[66:17.48]I'm going.
[66:23.37]Can I break these things?
[66:30.13]Oh, the noise this would make.
[66:49.23]Go around me, go around me!
[66:56.93]Go around me!
[66:58.63]Fucking idiot.
[67:11.66]I would put like a little sound board up here and have like choo-choo sounds.
[67:19.44]That was a PogChamp moment.
[67:20.58]I would not have made it through that.
[67:22.90]Do you see how narrow that was?
[67:24.68]Alright, cultivate the field.
[67:25.84]I have a new strategy.
[67:27.94]It's called go horizontal.
[67:29.34]You ready?
[67:34.23]Wait.
[67:35.53]Wait, what the hell am I doing right now?
[67:39.33]Am I just redoing the thing?
[67:41.21]Is this going back to what I've... Am I just making it go back the way it was?
[67:51.55]Why did you make me do all this?
[68:00.44]You're stealing your neighbor's crops.
[68:02.06]It's really bad for your social... Wait, what do you mean... What do you mean cultivating?
[68:06.36]This was the exact same way it looked before!
[68:08.64]This is the idiot test!
[68:19.07]You know that funny business card that somebody pulls out where it says, this is the idiot test.
[68:22.98]Turn around to find the answer.
[68:24.88]And then on the other side, this is the idiot test.
[68:27.32]Turn around to find the answer.
[68:29.58]And I turn it around five, ten times.
[68:31.77]I idiot.
[68:33.65]That's what I'm doing right now.
[68:34.99]This is the idiot test business card joke.
[68:49.84]I should just go steal all their crops.
[68:51.87]Do I care about my social score?
[68:57.47]Do I care if I have a bunch of, like, haters?
[69:02.95]That's all that means, right?
[69:20.90]This is not going as bad.
[69:26.28]Do you care about getting arrested?
[69:31.65]Okay, the only warning that popped up on my screen was... Hey, some people on social media aren't going to like you anymore.
[69:40.38]But here's $700,000 worth of crops.
[69:41.70]Oh.
[69:58.96]You're gonna lose like 12 Facebook friends.
[70:03.12]But gain a million dollars.
[70:05.40]Who's fucking calling me?
[70:22.37]Is money all that you care about?
[70:23.69]No.
[70:34.89]It's one of the only things I get, no.
[70:39.13]People won't buy these crops.
[70:40.51]Well, then I'll just store them in my silo for when fucking Armageddon happens.
[71:06.01]What is this pattern?
[71:08.11]Uh, I call this pattern... Late Game Space Invaders.
[71:39.95]I'm supposed to use this machine on the wheat.
[71:41.69]Now, that would be really, really funny if I believed you.
[71:46.29]Because then I would just drive over it and go, oh, I'm supposed to be here doing, like, tilling her wheat.
[71:52.33]Right, okay.
[71:55.05]But, I mean, you're a little late.
[71:57.55]I accidentally already drove over a portion of it, and it told me stop.
[72:17.63]Yeah, this outfit looks intentional.
[72:22.65]Like, I'm dressed up to be on this tractor.
[72:24.75]Alright, almost done.
[72:40.72]Dressed to catch Pokémon.
[72:46.00]Lower it!
[72:55.00]Your character is honestly shit.
[72:56.34]Can I join your server to kick your ass?
[73:05.98]Alright, I better get something good for this, because this was like two.
[73:08.99]This is two.
[73:10.05]Clara seems to be really fond of you.
[73:11.63]Got it.
[73:16.43]Work done.
[73:16.95]You may keep the plow, but you can still talk to Clara.
[73:20.15]See if she can teach you something.
[73:23.04]Nice.
[73:23.42]Alright, I don't even need to do the rest.
[73:25.67]Who cares?
[73:27.49]You received a plow and 500 social points.
[73:31.59]Good.
[73:31.75]Alright, let's go to, um... Let's go talk to Clara.
[73:40.78]Oh, wait.
[73:41.04]I have to do my... I have to fix my house.
[73:45.66]Where was Clara?
[73:46.24]She's over here, right?
[73:59.64]This is her farm right here, right?
[74:01.40]Oh, let this up.
[74:04.66]Alright, Clara!
[74:08.42]What can you teach me?
[74:09.18]Uh-oh.
[74:17.23]Getting stuck.
[74:19.77]Hey!
[74:24.16]Okay, I thought that was this guy's hair.
[74:28.72]For a second, it looked like he had a weird clown hair.
[74:30.76]Okay.
[74:30.86]Sure.
[74:30.96]What does that mean?
[74:31.68]What about seeds?
[74:32.30]How do I prepare fields?
[74:34.06]How do I gather crops?
[74:35.18]Anything more.
[74:35.69]What about seeds?
[74:36.63]Oh, cool.
[74:57.14]Okay.
[74:58.12]And fertilizing.
[75:00.28]You can buy good fertilizers in the store and spray them on your fields.
[75:03.64]Okay, let me get this sprayed.
[75:04.80]But if you have animals, use manure to fertilize fields too.
[75:08.33]Oh, you can have animals?
[75:09.27]I gotta go.
[75:09.93]No more quests.
[75:10.77]I gotta go fix my shit.
[75:12.11]You'll have to use different machines for these, of course.
[75:17.35]Thanks.
[75:17.93]I'll see you around.
[75:29.31]Alright, I have to do the main storyline quest.
[75:44.64]No, I'll lose points.
[75:45.96]I was going to just take out the whole thing.
[75:50.42]I was going to do every single flower.
[75:52.41]It was going to be gone.
[75:57.49]God, I can't fucking leave this way.
[76:01.27]I wanna just ditch it.
[76:02.13]I just can't do this GTA style.
[76:04.01]When you get stuck, you just run.
[76:05.23]Okay, I'm almost out.
[76:21.56]Where's the exit?
[76:27.04]jump it.
[76:27.66]I can't jump it with this thing.
[76:28.70]I have to go all the way out.
[76:29.74]Can I take all the... No.
[76:32.30]Alright, day one is almost done.
[76:33.46]I still have to sleep.
[76:40.59]Okay, I almost got it.
[76:41.55]That was close.
[76:45.65]Alright, back to home.
[76:56.38]You can have animals.
[76:58.96]Can I just have an animal farm?
[77:01.12]What if I don't want to do crops?
[77:09.08]Where's my truck?
[77:11.20]I have no idea.
[77:11.62]I'm going too fast.
[77:17.30]Just have thousands of ducks.
[77:19.92]Okay.
[77:21.39]That actually sounds like pretty fun.
[77:24.92]I'm not sure which garage is the garage I'm supposed to use to park anything.
[77:27.66]Alright, here I am.
[77:31.72]I need to repair... This.
[77:37.02]Barn.
[77:37.32]Your animals live here.
[77:38.12]Keep this building in good shape so your animals grow healthy.
[77:41.48]Are there animals even in here already?
[77:43.45]There's no animals even in here.
[77:45.83]If they are, this is horrible.
[77:46.97]Alright, let me fix this stuff.
[77:56.19]I'm not even going to scrape the extra bits off.
[77:57.77]Okay.
[78:05.06]Repair the bricks.
[78:07.34]What about down here?
[78:07.94]Is it supposed to look like that?
[78:25.08]Okay, the door?
[78:36.81]What else needs fixing?
[78:37.63]Up there?
[78:38.51]Can I get it?
[78:38.89]If I can reach from here, good.
[78:44.15]This ceiling is fucked.
[78:50.82]But it still looks like shit.
[78:52.76]Can I, like, can I replace all the brick eventually?
[78:59.43]This looks horrible.
[79:01.25]I can't even paint it?
[79:02.09]There's still a hole here.
[79:23.12]Something wrong with the tub?
[79:27.67]What's the first animal you guys want?
[79:29.03]Duck?
[79:36.25]These ducks are going to give you a bad Yelp review.
[79:39.09]What is this, an Airbnb?
[79:40.25]Okay, almost.
[79:50.56]Is this still fucked up?
[80:01.46]your senses what is it's more like hitman actually alright do I even I don't even want to get on the roof is it do I use the scaffolding but you can just look up
[80:35.18]That's a lot of info up on that HUD.
[80:37.66]Too much info.
[80:48.07]Only if we're this easy in real life.
[80:49.59]Yeah, if only.
[80:50.23]Alright, how we doing?
[80:52.55]Outside look alright?
[80:53.63]I have to get up there with a scaffold.
[80:57.15]Where's my scaffold?
[81:01.09]How do I remove the scaffolds?
[81:02.77]The whole place is gonna be covered in scaffolding.
[81:04.49]It's gonna look terrible.
[81:09.31]Can I remove all this rotted wood?
[81:10.85]This is the aesthetic.
[81:28.75]That's not a good aesthetic.
[81:45.86]There's so much work to do here.
[81:48.95]I'm not even close.
[81:52.79]What time?
[81:53.15]Is there a watch?
[82:06.68]You be a real farmer, use the sun.
[82:09.36]I mean, it's about to go down.
[82:10.31]What happens at night?
[82:13.44]Is there any downside to being out here at night, or does it even matter?
[82:29.82]Zombies.
[82:30.26]You have to kill stuff with a nail gun.
[82:36.96]I mean, I'll tell you one thing about this game.
[82:39.22]You can say whatever you want.
[82:40.22]It doesn't matter what you say.
[82:41.68]You could say, oh, this is stupid.
[82:42.95]This is great.
[82:45.13]Sound is, that nail gun sound is fantastic.
[82:56.67]It sounds great.
[82:58.85]Alright.
[82:59.19]So this is almost, is this dollar done?
[83:03.44]Let me use my spider sense.
[83:05.70]Slurry tank.
[83:06.56]When your animals produce slurry, it's deposed from here to be used as fertilizer.
[83:11.15]You need a dedicated spreader for this task.
[83:13.67]Wait.
[83:14.51]What do you mean, when my animals produce slurry?
[83:20.39]Why do you have to call it slurry?
[83:21.71]This thing good to go.
[83:31.50]That sounds gross as fuck.
[83:32.68]It does.
[83:33.46]Because it is.
[83:48.65]Oh man, this is all rundown.
[83:52.68]How many times do I have to do?
[83:53.50]Okay, not that much more.
[84:01.62]And then we're gonna get our first animal.
[84:04.54]Are they expensive?
[84:08.68]How do you get money?
[84:10.21]I have to sell crops and shit?
[84:13.29]I don't have any crops.
[84:29.84]Get an animal.
[84:34.73]Alright, I'm going to buy an animal.
[84:35.81]How much is a duck?
[84:38.01]Less than a hundred bucks?
[84:42.31]Alright, this shit is done.
[84:43.77]It has to be.
[84:44.40]I don't see anything else.
[84:48.38]Cows owned.
[84:57.26]The whole thing's repaired, right?
[84:58.46]Oh, come on.
[84:59.08]Get a break.
[85:02.00]I think this is cows only.
[85:04.18]You fixed your cow shed.
[85:05.42]Your neighbors appreciate your work.
[85:06.56]You receive 5,000 social points.
[85:10.48]Cool.
[85:11.52]How do I get a cow?
[85:24.35]They live here?
[85:24.90]Social points.
[85:38.19]How do I get a cow?
[85:43.29]Henhouse, your poultry lives here.
[85:44.89]Keep this building in good shape.
[85:46.03]Alright, I guess I just have to repair everything.
[85:51.93]This doesn't have as much damage as the other one.
[86:01.84]It's getting dark out.
[86:04.14]Yeah.
[86:04.38]I don't think it matters.
[86:08.66]I truly don't think there are any consequences for not eating and not sleeping.
[86:25.90]Almost done with this.
[86:29.95]You will die.
[86:30.55]You don't die in this game.
[86:32.49]They did not program in dying.
[86:35.47]Except in the very beginning when your grandfather died.
[86:38.41]That's the only death that's programmed into the game.
[86:51.96]Go get a roof.
[87:00.12]Can I put lights in here?
[87:05.42]If you don't eat, you're gonna lose social points.
[87:12.89]That would be actually pretty funny.
[87:19.69]What's left?
[87:20.37]One more!
[87:20.93]One more section, and then we can get... I'm gonna go to the store.
[87:25.83]I'm gonna steal a bunch of crops, sell the crops, and then buy some hens.
[87:29.99]I think that's the plan here.
[87:32.95]What else?
[87:33.25]Anything else broken?
[87:35.45]No?
[87:40.46]Didn't tell me I did it.
[87:42.24]Didn't say, hey, congratulations, you completed the hen house.
[87:47.72]Why?
[87:48.44]Oh, because of this.
[87:59.90]To sleep in the henhouse.
[88:01.02]I would if I could.
[88:03.24]I probably can.
[88:18.35]What's this?
[88:25.68]Is that where I can place the henhouses?
[88:27.42]I have to buy a henhouse then.
[88:29.92]Alright.
[88:30.72]Here we go.
[88:32.36]Actual fucking... Actual thing gonna happen on stream.
[88:35.48]Can you believe it?
[88:35.98]We're gonna get a hen.
[88:37.62]Tomorrow.
[88:52.89]Hen house is almost done.
[88:55.64]And that's it.
[88:57.63]Your neighbors appreciate it.
[88:58.55]3,000 social points.
[89:03.55]What time is it?
[89:10.32]What is all this?
[89:11.08]Field owner you.
[89:14.88]Canola?
[89:16.18]Ready for harvest.
[89:18.36]Shift plus left click to sell this field.
[89:24.27]How much do I get if I sell it?
[89:25.33]What do I get if I sell on it?
[89:28.98]Alright, complete.
[89:29.88]I have to finish the repairs on the house.
[89:38.97]How tired am I?
[89:42.43]Your condition depends.
[89:43.41]So what does this even mean?
[89:47.93]Dry.
[89:48.53]Animals.
[89:50.05]Dogs.
[89:51.17]Cats.
[89:51.85]Cows.
[89:52.51]Hens.
[89:53.01]Ducks.
[89:53.41]Geese.
[89:53.81]Pigeons.
[89:54.57]Eggs.
[89:58.23]What?
[90:00.06]I can get geese?
[90:01.08]That's cool.
[90:01.62]Alright, I'm just gonna go to bed.
[90:04.26]I want light.
[90:07.10]Where is my bed?
[90:09.78]Which one of these is my house?
[90:12.54]Here it is, right?
[90:17.77]Do I have a bed?
[90:24.51]Why do I have two twin beds?
[90:29.48]Okay.
[90:37.86]Hold on, did I just sleep for a week?
[90:44.83]Sleep on bed, rest for a week.
[90:58.64]Am I okay?
[91:01.56]I haven't eaten in a week.
[91:02.66]Good thing I have a tomato in my inventory.
[91:06.88]Um... Start the music again.
[91:12.91]Alright, that's my pantry.
[91:16.55]Why would you have a pantry in the basement?
[91:23.69]I have no idea what that function is for.
[91:26.08]Why does that exist?
[91:30.32]Why would you have sleep for a week be an option?
[91:33.80]What does it do?
[91:37.83]If you get injured?
[91:40.75]And by the way, speaking of something, there's like four or five bedrooms in this house.
[91:50.22]Can I actually get a family in here?
[91:51.78]Look at all these rooms!
[91:58.18]There's a seesaw?
[91:58.98]I'll fix that seesaw.
[92:01.72]I'm getting married too.
[92:02.74]Oh, you thought we were going to play this game for like 10 minutes.
[92:05.16]Wow, you were so wrong.
[92:08.19]That couldn't have been more incorrect.
[92:16.53]Alright, is the roof alright?
[92:21.80]Do not misunderstand me.
[92:22.78]We will never play this game ever again after probably the next day or so.
[92:27.12]But I ain't playing this for 10 minutes.
[92:39.92]Alright, what about the outside?
[92:40.94]Oh, it's in fucking shambles.
[93:06.41]Go harvest your crops.
[93:07.43]I don't have any crops.
[93:11.55]The game wants me to... I don't have any children.
[93:20.09]With multiple slides?
[93:29.64]Rusty metal.
[93:30.68]I'm just shaving down the rusty metal.
[93:32.90]Just buy a new one.
[93:36.60]How much are these?
[93:38.34]How much is a seesaw?
[93:42.13]Like, it can't be more than like 30 bucks.
[93:44.61]40 bucks.
[93:47.49]Repair the old wood.
[93:48.69]No, this is like dangerous.
[93:50.03]Just get a new one.
[93:51.93]Replace the sand in here.
[93:53.11]This is fucking gross.
[93:59.62]There's like shards of glass in here.
[94:03.04]Make sure you repair the rotten wood.
[94:16.36]Can you... Can I push somebody on the slide eventually?
[94:18.97]Wow, that would be so cool.
[94:22.03]This is MY farm.
[94:23.23]This is MY house.
[94:24.35]Ain't nobody gonna take this from me.
[94:29.40]Until the storyline dictates when it should happen.
[94:32.32]But for now, it's mine.
[94:49.56]Wait till we have an Oliver.
[94:50.86]Oliver's gonna turn on me.
[94:55.16]Highly doubt it.
[94:58.98]Air bricks.
[95:03.36]Can't reach it.
[95:03.90]Gotta get a scaffolding.
[95:05.10]But let's check the outside bed.
[95:06.78]Sleeping regularly helps you maintain good health and energy for work.
[95:09.48]Combine sleep with good food.
[95:11.52]You might miss job opportunities when hungry and tired.
[95:16.83]Or if we're sleeping for a full week.
[95:18.43]I think that's the easiest way to miss an opportunity.
[95:22.09]I don't think that has to do with if I'm hungry today.
[95:34.90]You can use it to turn basic foods into canned ones.
[95:37.00]Your wife can cook delicious treats.
[95:39.02]I don't have a wife!
[95:42.03]You're losing food from the pantry!
[95:46.15]Who's this imaginary wife that I have?
[95:52.43]Do I need to get married?
[95:53.65]I just got here.
[95:55.08]I don't know any of these fucking people.
[96:19.32]Alright, we're almost at the... I have to go all the way up, really.
[96:25.03]That looks worse than like it did before.
[96:26.37]How's the outside?
[96:31.47]Alright, time to go up to the second floor.
[96:32.96]That is a gigantic chimney.
[96:40.16]You can cut that in half and it would still be fine.
[96:41.88]That's a Minecraft house chimney.
[96:45.69]That's too big.
[96:50.54]Let's get up.
[96:51.68]Hey.
[96:55.23]What the fuck?
[97:00.19]Do I have a well?
[97:01.27]Can I get water out of the well?
[97:03.19]Look at all this other shit I have to repair.
[97:08.50]Can I not go up?
[97:19.62]shit um I'm gonna go this way delete the scaffolding alright let's get up there alright repair and another scaffolding god damn it
[97:49.64]Am I going to play Half-Life Alyx on stream?
[97:54.77]Uh, probably not.
[97:57.01]I mean, no, I don't think so.
[98:01.39]No, I probably, I don't, I mean, no, it's just probably one of the largest technological VR jumps in technology and gaming in the history of virtual reality headsets.
[98:11.33]I probably will play a free-to-play horror game that somebody made in three days next time.
[98:29.68]Or a Unity Farmer game.
[98:31.40]You don't know this is made in Unity.
[98:32.52]How do you know that?
[98:34.62]How do you know this is made in Unity?
[98:35.74]You don't know.
[98:36.72]How do you know?
[98:40.98]It's not Unity.
[98:42.93]This is a proprietary engine that was crafted in-house.
[98:56.03]For all you guys know, this could be better than the Frostbite engine.
[99:07.18]This runs better than Frostbite Engine, so... Alright, we got... I gotta get in there.
[99:14.26]The second floor is having problems.
[99:17.36]My shins!
[99:19.31]Don't worry, Dad's okay.
[99:20.53]Dad'll be fine.
[99:27.95]Upstairs.
[99:33.35]What do you mean, Dad?
[99:34.45]Who the fuck do you think I am in this scenario?
[99:41.33]How would I not be dad?
[99:42.41]I'm the only one here.
[99:46.25]It's me, dad.
[99:49.27]There's one piece that's just broken somewhere, and I'm never gonna find it.
[100:05.41]There it is.
[100:13.97]Oh, fuck off with this.
[100:15.79]Where is it?
[100:22.06]It's the door.
[100:35.95]Where is the problem?
[100:42.39]What's the issue here?
[100:50.31]What happens if I just sleep?
[100:52.57]For a week?
[100:53.75]Like a hundred times in a row?
[100:56.65]Do we just teleport like 10 years in the future?
[101:06.39]Sleep?
[101:06.97]Should I sleep for like 200 years and see what happens?
[101:09.23]There's a chest?
[101:13.43]Fish?
[101:13.81]I thought it was a chainsaw.
[101:15.91]Fish in aroma oil.
[101:19.92]I don't think this is something you would take out of this chest.
[101:28.62]You would throw this away, but I'm gonna eat it.
[101:31.90]But before I eat it, I need to, like, make a YouTube- I have to turn on my YouTube channel video.
[101:35.32]I have to, yeah, I have to, like, videotape me doing this.
[101:45.33]Alright, that's it, right?
[101:47.35]What else is left to repair in the house?
[101:52.37]There's nothing else here to fix.
[101:54.87]Help me out here.
[102:01.37]The fence is outside?
[102:02.47]Does that count as the house?
[102:07.15]Did I miss a room?
[102:12.56]I did.
[102:23.09]Alright, the thing that I don't understand, though, is... All this stuff is, like, shitty.
[102:32.66]Even if I... I want this different wallpaper.
[102:35.36]Use the kitchen.
[102:39.44]Applesauce.
[102:41.86]Cookbook recipes.
[102:42.84]What about honey-based recipes?
[102:46.49]Eggs.
[102:46.87]Hot sauce.
[102:49.03]Unknown.
[102:49.55]Egg-based.
[102:50.05]I don't know any of these.
[102:52.49]There's food here, though, somehow.
[103:00.60]It's the fence outside that's doing it.
[103:02.16]Are you sure?
[103:02.70]You might be right.
[103:28.30]I kind of want to save the game and then sleep like fucking a hundred times.
[103:31.54]And just skip every cutscene and see if we can like teleport ten years in the future.
[103:40.74]See if the world changes at all.
[103:46.99]Hold on.
[103:53.19]Get a family first.
[103:55.41]Yeah, yeah.
[103:56.23]Let's get a family.
[103:57.61]Let's have a wife, have a kid.
[103:58.79]And then sleep for 30 years and see if the kid grows up.
[104:04.00]That's not a bad play.
[104:04.96]I like that play.
[104:14.46]There is nothing else to fix over here.
[104:17.33]Why have I not gotten any social points for this?
[104:26.59]I'm gonna piss my pants.
[104:27.41]I'll be right back.
[104:36.50]Pretty good condition.
[104:37.32]No families.
[104:38.82]11,000 points.
[104:39.10]Alright, I'll be right back.
[104:39.66]I'm gonna pee my pants if I don't get the fuck out of here.
[104:42.06]Be right back.
[105:19.11]Thank you.
[105:52.97]Amen.
[107:11.89]Okay, I'm back.
[107:12.73]I'm going to do this thing now where when I come back, I don't just go like this because I'm gone for three minutes straight.
[107:21.24]Hey, I'm back.
[107:22.10]It's like, Jesus.
[107:23.62]So I'm going to slowly be like, hey, I'm back.
[107:25.44]Okay, let's go.
[107:25.96]Alright, so the goal here is find a family and then try to artificially age them all by like 10 years.
[107:45.83]That's going to be such a waste of time.
[107:47.63]You know how long that's going to take?
[107:54.85]Game sucks.
[107:55.45]Play Half- Alyx.
[108:03.55]Yeah, so I'm just gonna play this until Half- Alyx comes out.
[108:06.49]That's what you're saying, right?
[108:07.40]Like, yeah, game sucks.
[108:08.64]Like, you should transition over to Half- Alyx.
[108:11.72]Yeah, so in four months or five months.
[108:14.10]I'll just do this for five months.
[108:15.56]That's what you wanted?
[108:22.09]Alright, game save, let's go.
[108:23.43]Just gotta fix some more stuff.
[108:26.55]I'm into it right now.
[108:27.67]I'm into this.
[108:29.35]I need to see this through.
[108:39.62]Harvest the wheat, get mad bucks.
[108:41.44]I need to find out why this is not done.
[108:47.93]Is there something on the roof I missed?
[108:50.83]You've earned no money.
[108:51.95]It's not all about the money.
[108:54.89]Okay?
[108:55.57]It's not about the money.
[108:57.17]Sometimes it's about just having fun and relaxing and making a farm.
[109:02.30]It's always about money with you guys.
[109:04.52]Money, money, money.
[109:05.52]You should make more money.
[109:09.26]I'm always about how I want to just do something because I want to.
[109:13.22]It's the basement.
[109:14.04]Is it the basement?
[109:24.81]That's such a huge fall, and it's funny that it didn't happen.
[109:28.45]No, there's nothing in here that's broken.
[109:32.07]Nothing in here.
[109:43.28]Damn it.
[109:44.26]What is the one little thing that's wrong?
[109:46.96]The well?
[109:51.41]There's one tiny thing wrong with this house that I can't figure it out.
[109:56.41]Hold on.
[109:58.59]Is there no bathroom in this house?
[110:24.77]Why is there not a bathroom in the house?
[110:32.52]That's a huge, huge issue.
[110:36.60]If this is... Go in the outhouse.
[110:41.18]There is no outhouse.
[110:44.31]Are we just supposed to shit into the well?
[110:45.71]Alright, well, I don't know what's wrong with it.
[110:53.81]Is the gazebo broken?
[110:55.55]No, this is normal.
[110:57.05]It's ugly, but it's normal.
[110:58.43]Grain storage.
[110:59.29]Okay, I have to make some money.
[111:00.83]Dog house.
[111:01.27]How do I get a dog?
[111:10.44]I still don't understand what... Wait!
[111:11.98]There it is!
[111:12.50]I see it!
[111:12.88]No, I don't.
[111:16.63]Fuck.
[111:17.95]What's the problem?
[111:24.44]Alright, I gotta get up there before I delete this.
[111:25.78]Because there's just scaffolding all over the damn house.
[111:37.48]Alright, delete it.
[111:41.18]I don't want scaffolding on my house.
[111:42.42]Delete it.
[111:52.58]Follow the arrow.
[111:56.07]What do I have for a mission?
[111:57.09]Complete repairs on your farm.
[112:02.31]I have this fucking dumb place.
[112:06.28]God, this is gonna be great.
[112:08.28]Great.
[112:13.58]Is it a balcony window?
[112:15.72]I'll check it out in a minute.
[112:21.65]We're not gonna get a family unless I make this place a home.
[112:26.22]I'm not going to impress anybody that comes over here.
[112:31.12]If it's the exact same thing as if to take somebody to like an old abandoned hospital.
[112:40.80]Yeah, you want to see where I live?
[112:42.18]Yeah, let's go to your house.
[112:43.74]Yeah, sure, come on over here.
[112:47.00]Cool, yeah, we're pulling up now.
[112:48.00]What do you think?
[112:49.86]What do you think of my old fucking haunted house YouTube channel?
[112:53.60]Abandoned hospital, let's walk through it.
[112:58.22]Uh, it has to look at least okay.
[113:12.06]What is this?
[113:13.11]Grain storage?
[113:14.13]Alright, there's a lot of stuff I need to know.
[113:19.25]What is all this?
[113:20.07]Okay, stop.
[113:20.99]Stop getting distracted.
[113:22.71]Repair building only.
[113:24.23]That's the only thing I need to do right now.
[113:25.35]That's it.
[113:25.71]Nothing else.
[113:29.10]Repair only.
[113:36.45]Make sure I save the game there, too.
[113:37.83]That would be such a painful disaster if it... What is this?
[113:41.93]This is like my ga- I have my own gas station?
[113:53.24]You have your own gas station on a farm?
[113:58.99]I pull shit in there and just pump my own tank?
[114:06.16]That's kinda cool.
[114:08.48]I gotta get up.
[114:20.93]Get up top.
[114:30.49]I gotta get all the way up, though.
[114:31.95]Yeah, there we go.
[114:37.83]Oh, what a city slicker.
[114:48.24]Almost got a game sucks Jupiter.
[114:50.06]Nice work.
[114:52.14]Almost.
[114:52.98]But he's still pretty far away.
[114:59.47]I would play this game non-ironically if it had co-op.
[115:05.53]I think that's the greatest travesty in all of these simulator video games.
[115:14.36]Why can't I just do this on a server?
[115:16.28]You know what I mean?
[115:21.82]I would love to play House Flipper and just have two or three people decorate a house together.
[115:35.77]I would love a real estate video game where you buy, build, dress, and sell a house.
[115:43.56]That's my idea.
[115:45.76]That's my idea.
[115:57.07]Let it be known here first.
[116:00.41]The... No, not like a tycoon game where you just put down monopoly buildings.
[116:04.19]No, I'm talking about like you build with wood.
[116:06.99]You build the houses.
[116:09.09]And you do it the way you want.
[116:10.27]Oh, this one's gonna have a basement.
[116:11.69]This one's gonna have an attic.
[116:12.81]This one's gonna have... Look, this is a big open concept in the living room.
[116:17.72]And you design it, you decorate it, you put the furniture in, and you sell it.
[116:21.66]So, yeah, Minecraft, but not blocks, but real.
[116:27.22]And you can't sell real estate in Minecraft.
[116:30.78]That's not Minecraft.
[116:31.94]What are you talking about?
[116:32.78]Sell real life.
[116:36.84]Yes, guys, like real life.
[116:38.65]I'm gonna spend three, four, five hundred thousand dollars on a building.
[116:43.71]No.
[116:44.97]I wanna be able to do it in fake life so I don't have to spend any money.
[117:00.08]What else needs to be repaired?
[117:01.16]That, but... Alright.
[117:02.84]Do I got everything on the roof?
[117:04.54]I think so.
[117:15.79]Twitch builds a house.
[117:22.13]There's no way that would work.
[117:28.19]You know, I thought of a stream a while back.
[117:31.03]Actually, this is during the House Flipper streams.
[117:33.55]I was thinking about, would it be funny if I were to try to actually, like, redecorate a house in real life?
[117:44.44]Just an open floor with paint and stuff.
[117:47.06]Just put up, like, build, like, three or four artificial rooms.
[117:53.68]And then decorate them.
[117:55.19]And take you through it.
[118:01.06]Okay, that's done.
[118:01.86]I think that's done.
[118:02.44]Oh, fuck.
[118:08.40]Hold on.
[118:11.49]There's so many repairs to do.
[118:18.29]That would take too much effort.
[118:22.47]It would take a lot of prep, but I don't think it would be too big.
[118:25.35]All I would need to do is just put up like a wood and then just have like some drywall.
[118:34.80]Just make like a fake room in like a studio.
[118:39.60]Be on studio and have like three small rooms made that can have like couches and furniture and stuff in them.
[118:58.75]Like a TV show set.
[118:59.84]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[119:01.02]It wouldn't be like a full house.
[119:02.32]It would be like the Seinfeld set, but I would just have to decorate it and paint it.
[119:20.76]Dollhouse.
[119:22.37]The Jerma dollhouse.
[119:24.27]Have multiple floors and it's just weird.
[119:26.47]The camera zooms out.
[119:27.47]I like walk up the stairs.
[119:29.23]I get into the bed.
[119:30.13]Ooh, this is comfy.
[119:32.93]Does it have to be real life Sims?
[119:37.44]God damn, do I have to actually write this one down?
[119:40.26]Imagine if I made a fucking dollhouse cut in half sort of like set.
[119:45.11]And you guys just played The Sims, but it was just me in a house.
[120:08.50]That would be really, really creepy.
[120:14.48]That would be scary, in a way.
[120:19.44]Because I would be acting like a Sim.
[120:21.26]I wouldn't be speaking English or anything.
[120:22.84]I'd be talking like Sim and you guys would have to tell me what to do.
[120:30.42]I would be speaking Simlish and waving at you guys and stuff.
[120:35.38]Doing the thing where like I'm gonna fucking shit my pants and like you got I go I won't go I just pee on the floor and stuff that oh my god I have to I think we might have to do this You'll have bars underneath I'll have to go get a job I wonder if you guys could handle that
[121:06.85]and if I leave the house or lie down to go to bed we just do like a fake it's going times 10 speed so we'll just go to the next day and I'll like shake around like it's going 10 times speed in the bed I gotta be careful I don't tell you every joke that I'm gonna do oops alright we're good
[121:37.01]How are you gonna deal with the fires?
[121:48.13]The set is burning down and I'm just jumping up and down going I'm getting like burnt
[122:17.47]Install mods?
[122:19.49]No.
[122:27.44]Cooking.
[122:27.86]I would have, like, cooking skills.
[122:33.02]That would be the only time where I would even remotely... No, I couldn't even do it, though.
[122:40.59]I couldn't do it.
[122:42.58]What is that?
[122:44.30]You found a string trimmer.
[122:45.52]Now you can cut grass.
[122:46.64]Oh, nice.
[122:50.34]No breaks.
[122:51.18]Like 24-hour stream type shit.
[122:53.60]But I can't do it.
[122:55.28]I couldn't do it.
[122:55.88]I can't do it 24 hours.
[122:56.90]I just can't do it.
[122:57.53]I physically can't.
[123:06.31]Plus, I ain't going to the bathroom.
[123:08.09]Like, in that dollhouse.
[123:10.09]No.
[123:10.73]No way.
[123:11.65]Maybe I would artificially go to the bathroom.
[123:23.48]Alright.
[123:23.78]Honest to god, what else is broken?
[123:26.24]I see something in there.
[123:33.12]Yeah, and my job would... I would make money.
[123:35.31]And you could purchase stuff.
[123:37.85]Oh, man.
[123:39.11]I'll just have a bunch of random fucking furniture that you guys can buy and just moved into the house.
[123:49.40]Yeah, you could do buy mode and just put stuff in the house.
[123:52.90]Can I reach it?
[124:02.67]Nope.
[124:07.95]Alright, put a lid on this.
[124:09.73]Put a lid on this.
[124:12.95]Okay, we never talked about this.
[124:17.95]Did it!
[124:25.46]Alright, the barn is fixed.
[124:28.44]What else do I have to do now?
[124:30.38]Complete repairs on your home.
[124:35.02]Is there really more shit to do?
[124:48.19]Am I sure I can handle a real job?
[124:50.65]I handled students, okay?
[124:54.57]I was a goddamn teacher.
[124:56.15]You don't think I can handle that?
[125:08.08]If I can handle all the kids, like, screaming and... Oh, I can handle...
[125:21.98]What is the last thing I need to fix in this fucking stupid town?
[125:25.48]This is a town.
[125:26.38]This is not even a... This is a town.
[125:31.85]What am I missing?
[125:35.31]This music is way too epic for this.
[125:38.99]I don't like this.
[125:40.07]It needs to be slower.
[125:47.62]Music to pump in like Sims music I'm going to be a moron on this stream to like I know you like that anyways No, I'm talking like sim.
[126:03.03]I'm only gonna go where you tell me to go It's not the basement I just was down there What's wrong with this house
[126:18.72]What did I miss?
[126:25.60]What are the repairs?
[126:26.60]The door?
[126:42.01]There's no bathroom in this house.
[126:43.39]You can't tell me I missed the bathroom.
[126:48.55]Damn it.
[126:49.95]Something happened to me and I can't even explain what it was.
[126:52.03]It just sucks.
[127:03.33]Life sucks right this second.
[127:07.96]I found it!
[127:09.00]There is a bathroom in this house.
[127:12.08]No, there's not.
[127:12.94]There's just a bathtub.
[127:14.06]How do you go to the bathroom?
[127:23.64]What is this?
[127:24.16]Is this a urinal?
[127:27.44]Did you just poo down the drain?
[127:29.34]There's still something to repair.
[127:37.59]Okay, the house is- What else do I need to repair?
[127:45.23]Alright, I gotta turn this music down.
[127:48.32]It's giving me fucking anxiety.
[128:06.54]I'm scanning everything.
[128:07.54]I already did all that.
[128:10.21]The grain place?
[128:14.47]Oh, damn it.
[128:15.27]This stupid thing.
[128:16.27]This whole thing needs to be fixed.
[128:26.26]Very clearly, I'm just repainting this.
[128:39.81]Honestly, the inside of this looks like a Silent Hill.
[128:43.15]Hmm hmm.
[128:55.30]Hmm hmm hmm.
[128:57.22]Hmm hmm.
[128:59.10]Hmm hmm hmm.
[129:09.66]Good.
[129:14.42]This town is making him stupid.
[129:20.24]Are you sure it's not all the rust I'm breathing in?
[129:22.34]I don't want to get on scaffolding.
[129:44.66]I have to get on the damn scaffolding, don't I?
[129:46.54]Ah, fine.
[129:51.85]Get on it!
[130:02.85]Let's go!
[130:08.10]Far- Farmer's destiny sure did turn into be
[130:13.75]Uh... Farmer repairs whole town.
[130:28.83]This is your farm.
[130:31.29]I'm not- I'm not farming anything!
[130:34.83]I'm scraping rust off of metal!
[130:38.91]When do I get to have corn in my inventory?
[130:52.43]Look at how fucked up this whole thing is.
[130:57.77]This is so labor intensive.
[131:02.06]Just get a helicopter and like airlift it off my property.
[131:20.45]Is this going to be a mayonnaise stream?
[131:22.13]If I can make mayonnaise, it definitely will happen.
[131:31.77]He's just snorting rust.
[131:34.53]I can't help it.
[131:37.23]Look, I'm going as fast as I can.
[131:41.20]There is no tool upgrade for me right now.
[131:43.10]There might be tools at the store that are better than this.
[131:47.32]I doubt it, though.
[132:05.72]Lying about mayonnaise?
[132:06.62]If it's possible... I don't know what I can make.
[132:08.84]I'm just trying to get the next quest.
[132:17.31]Alright, that's good.
[132:17.99]But I need to get that.
[132:19.19]Okay.
[132:26.41]Everything on top done.
[132:27.61]Yes.
[132:28.63]Now I've got to go inside.
[132:30.17]Ooh, the seeds.
[132:32.29]That's where they store the seeds.
[132:33.23]Okay.
[132:33.39]Okay.
[132:36.91]Pick up metal.
[132:38.56]Ooh, metal.
[132:45.53]Uh, what?
[132:45.95]That takes longer than shaving it.
[132:54.02]Do I have to do this to every single one?
[133:09.08]Please go farm.
[133:10.38]I can't until I do this.
[133:12.68]I have to do this first.
[133:24.04]Next iPad game.
[133:25.16]No, I'm staying here.
[133:26.44]I want to see what happens.
[133:29.10]We just have to deal with the paint your whole entire town again.
[133:35.81]Once it's done, it's done.
[133:36.79]And then we can move on.
[133:37.71]Trust me, it's gonna be worth it.
[133:39.85]We're gonna make corn, wheat... I'm gonna get... beans... Quick refunded.
[133:48.38]It's... I... I've been playing for two hours.
[133:50.86]It's not gonna happen.
[133:51.42]It's over.
[133:54.22]I'm not gonna... Why would I do that anyways?
[133:59.84]No, I want to be rewarded for my labor.
[134:08.03]Because you don't know that it sucks yet.
[134:12.61]We haven't even gotten that far yet.
[134:26.96]Just bear with me for a minute.
[134:30.06]You're on the tutorial.
[134:30.96]Yes, I am.
[134:33.56]Just wait till I get my own seeds.
[134:36.67]That's not exciting, but I'm gonna pretend it is.
[134:50.41]There are, yeah, there are seeds in here.
[134:54.65]This is the first strand type game.
[134:56.86]What are you talking about?
[135:18.82]This is the best way you to pretend to work.
[135:23.43]How's it going out there?
[135:24.57]It's going good!
[135:25.51]I'm just, uh... shooting compressed air into a board of sheet metal.
[135:32.64]If there was like 60 people on this job, I could blend in pretty quickly.
[135:39.52]Alright, see?
[135:40.92]That didn't take as long as you thought it was going to.
[135:49.13]Done.
[135:49.93]Almost.
[135:56.17]You're a movie extra.
[136:08.61]Yeah.
[136:10.03]Why is everything to be the same color?
[136:11.75]Why is everything gray?
[136:18.44]The, the, okay, the, everything's just metal.
[136:21.22]What?
[136:22.97]What does that do?
[136:31.49]Oh, I'm just shooting water all over me?
[136:36.17]I probably shouldn't have electricity in here.
[136:37.67]Well, I'm hungry, aren't I?
[136:55.86]Now it's going to get all rusty again.
[136:58.82]No, it won't.
[137:02.34]We'll be fine.
[137:04.36]Let me just replace all of these Silent Hill hospital beds.
[137:08.21]And we'll be good.
[137:10.27]And then I can finally start to make my farm.
[137:12.97]I am making my farm.
[137:22.48]Reusing jokes.
[137:23.46]I...
[137:24.85]I said that, I told that joke like nine minutes ago.
[137:28.87]It's still relevant.
[137:30.03]I can still, what do you mean re-use?
[137:31.61]It's not like been six days.
[137:34.11]It's been like four minutes.
[137:38.14]I haven't even got off the stage yet.
[137:41.46]You fixed your greenhouse, congratulations, thank you.
[137:43.42]Alright, seeds, what do we got?
[137:46.94]Use tomato seeds.
[137:49.62]Use tomato seedlings, store.
[137:51.46]Alright, tomato seeds.
[137:53.92]How many do I have?
[138:03.72]Okay.
[138:06.06]Now what do I do?
[138:07.10]How do I keep them alive?
[138:18.17]Need water.
[138:20.28]Okay, but hold on.
[138:21.04]But how much water does a tomato need?
[138:41.92]Why would you stand inside?
[138:44.07]Why wouldn't you put this on the outside?
[138:46.97]This seems like the dumbest mistake ever.
[138:50.73]Too much?
[138:53.80]Tomatoes in 90% water.
[139:00.74]I'm gonna keep it at comfort instead of wet.
[139:02.34]Alright, that's good.
[139:06.55]How long did they take to grow?
[139:11.97]Okay, cool.
[139:14.41]Nice.
[139:16.33]I got seeds in there now.
[139:17.51]Don't say I'm not doing anything.
[139:20.83]You're wrong.
[139:23.97]This is still something to repair.
[139:25.43]Okay, I didn't repair everything in here, did I?
[139:42.32]The silo.
[139:43.74]Thank you.
[139:45.16]Thank you.
[139:52.94]Did it!
[140:02.35]It's not it.
[140:03.61]There's more.
[140:15.48]Which roof?
[140:15.94]This roof?
[140:18.02]I need to get up and see all roofs.
[140:21.47]Okay, I can see all the roofs from here.
[140:24.77]Nothing's glowing.
[140:29.01]I thought that was it, but it's not.
[140:38.52]Where is it?
[140:40.78]Where's this last thing to repair?
[140:42.62]Alright, can I make the jump?
[140:46.64]Nice.
[140:46.86]Oh, give me a fucking break.
[140:53.56]Inside the building with the fuel?
[141:00.11]Nothing over here, right?
[141:00.91]Alright, inside the fuel building.
[141:10.66]Yeah, the greenhouse is done.
[141:13.00]What about in here?
[141:16.36]Fuel tanks.
[141:29.21]The greenhouse roof?
[141:30.23]No, greenhouse is done.
[141:31.03]I already got the reward for it.
[141:34.47]Grain duster?
[141:35.57]Where is this?
[141:55.19]Oh, god damn it.
[141:56.09]It's right here.
[142:12.54]20,000 social points.
[142:14.32]I did it.
[142:14.62]It's all done.
[142:15.40]Finally.
[142:17.28]No more quests.
[142:19.86]Now... Um...
[142:24.61]Now what do I do?
[142:25.83]Drone race?
[142:27.63]New quest!
[142:30.65]New quest.
[142:31.35]Fix one of the buildings.
[142:32.35]New quest.
[142:33.79]Transport.
[142:41.04]I'm gonna go to my fields.
[142:42.80]No, I'm gonna go to the store.
[142:44.30]Where's the store?
[142:46.30]General store.
[142:46.94]Right, where's my truck?
[142:53.78]Is that my truck?
[142:57.05]Yeah, my truck is over here.
[142:57.83]Alright, we're going to go truck, general store.
[142:59.93]And we're going to find ourselves a wife.
[143:07.42]Steal your neighbor's crops.
[143:08.44]Yeah, I feel like that was like three days ago.
[143:11.14]Is this mine?
[143:24.20]Wait, this is already done.
[143:25.05]This is mine.
[143:37.93]How do I harvest it?
[143:40.17]Will this harvest it?
[143:52.62]No.
[143:54.50]No, don't, don't, don't, stop, don't, don't, don't.
[143:58.02]Are you sure this doesn't harvest it?
[143:59.40]What harvests it?
[144:01.20]Do I even have the thing to harvest it?
[144:13.50]Is that a harvester?
[144:14.97]Like, will this work?
[144:16.07]No, this is like a tiller.
[144:27.92]Use a fire.
[144:31.78]Can I grab this?
[144:37.42]I need a... It's a different tool.
[144:38.49]Alright, well, fuck it.
[144:40.17]We're gonna go get it.
[144:47.35]It's a different vehicle.
[144:48.21]That's why it's got like thousands of dollars worth of stuff that I can't sell because I can't get it.
[144:55.31]I need to hire a worker.
[144:58.83]We'll go to town and find a worker.
[145:05.66]I need money though.
[145:06.30]I don't have any money.
[145:09.14]So here's the problem.
[145:11.62]I can't go get my truck.
[145:15.47]Because if I get my truck, then I'm going to leave my John Deere.
[145:18.69]If I leave my John Deere, I can't get the Harvester.
[145:20.34]If I can't get the Harvester, I'm going to have to transfer back and forth.
[145:30.41]Running is probably faster than this.
[145:44.05]It's not as stylish though.
[145:45.50]Yeah, but it's really slow.
[145:49.06]I wish there was a wave button.
[145:58.51]Ram.
[145:59.03]We already tried it.
[146:02.87]You just stop like two dead bricks.
[146:13.62]Yeah, run this guy, run this guy.
[146:14.68]I've already tried to run this guy over.
[146:17.12]So... I'm sorry.
[146:19.46]Alright, John.
[146:24.12]Yes.
[146:25.62]I... I'd like to trade.
[146:26.72]I need... Perfume.
[146:28.12]I don't have... How do I have zero dollars?
[146:45.16]Zero.
[146:56.23]A string trimmer?
[146:57.59]Mow grass?
[147:02.78]A shovel?
[147:06.46]I'm on a drone.
[147:07.86]A headlamp?
[147:10.66]What's with all these chocolates?
[147:14.92]Get a fishing pole.
[147:17.70]I'm gonna keep the string trimmer.
[147:19.58]No, I don't want to sell anything.
[147:28.11]Can I just take food from behind the counter?
[147:36.34]Oh well, um, now what do I do?
[147:39.40]Goodbye.
[147:43.20]Ready for harvest.

[183:38.72]How?
[183:39.83]Alright, Janet, what do you want?
[183:42.63]Janet, you have a harvester.
[183:53.21]I'm avoiding them, look.
[184:02.31]Steal money, not plants.
[184:07.21]Alright, where's Janet?
[184:20.96]Is anybody?
[184:21.46]Oh, there you are.
[184:21.96]Okay, hi, Janet.
[184:23.88]But first, let me go into your house first.
[184:25.84]No, I can't.
[184:26.58]It's fake.
[184:28.81]Hi!
[184:29.09]Hello, mister.
[184:29.91]I'm Janet.
[184:30.97]Have we met?
[184:31.67]Not yet.
[184:32.15]I'm your neighbor.
[184:33.75]I live just across that lake.
[184:35.65]Moved in not long ago.
[184:38.17]Hey, we just moved in too.
[184:40.35]Bought this farm and greenhouses to start a tomato business.
[184:43.98]Tomatoes?
[184:44.82]I love tomatoes.
[184:45.36]But it's such a mess.
[184:46.06]I feel cheated.
[184:46.94]The greenhouses are a ruin.
[184:48.66]I guess I can help you restore these.
[184:52.74]Can you now?
[184:53.60]That would be so great.
[184:55.78]But I don't have much money to pay you.
[184:59.26]What about that harvester over there?
[185:01.46]I think it's worth the effort.
[185:03.02]I can take it for an exchange.
[185:05.74]This sounds great.
[185:07.16]We have no use for it anyway.
[185:09.42]We wish to plant tomatoes, don't own any fields.
[185:12.28]What about the one I just drove over?
[185:13.34]In this case, I'm on it.
[185:15.17]I will fix your greenhouses in exchange for that harvester.
[185:19.63]What about the barn over there?
[185:21.63]Can you fix it too?
[185:23.25]I'll add the header to sweeten the deal.
[185:25.59]Sure.
[185:26.45]I can definitely.
[185:27.35]That's a lot of work.
[185:28.73]That's too much.
[185:30.68]I'll do it.
[185:30.94]A lot of work, but it's worth it.
[185:36.98]Have you finished your task?

[186:37.71]I need to have a child.
[186:38.91]I need a kid.
[186:39.57]The clock is ticking.
[186:53.42]What do you mean the clock is ticking?

[187:13.00]Okay, I'll do this later.
[187:16.38]I'll finish this another day.
[187:18.34]I need to buy animals.
[187:28.39]I'm doing minimal amount of work, by the way.
[187:30.19]I don't care if I don't... Oh, what about that little spot?
[187:32.25]No, don't care.
[187:47.90]Okay.

[188:29.37]Good.
[188:30.11]Alright, I should've just said, fuck that, it's too much work.

[188:59.72]Okay, now what do you want?
[189:04.46]This... Wait, I'm done.
[189:10.23]Fix the barn.
[189:11.19]Fuck, I forgot I agreed to do this.
[189:27.57]What's that?
[189:28.01]A cell phone tower?
[189:32.68]Wait, there's a cell phone tower in her backyard.
[189:40.08]We got 5G.
[189:49.67]Well, there's a 5G tower here.
[189:51.93]I'm gonna start hallucinating.
[190:07.33]I can't reach that.
[190:09.65]Is this the harvester?
[190:10.41]This thing's a piece of shit.
[190:15.26]It's broken.
[190:20.58]Why do I feel like if I look at this tower in real life, if I was standing right here and I went like this, it would go...
[190:36.88]I'm afraid of those things.
[190:42.58]Is it weird that I feel like those things give you bad dreams?
[190:51.51]It's just like... Humming like next to your house.
[190:56.37]It's probably gonna give you fucking nightmares.
[190:58.57]You're gonna wake up with like a metal taste in your mouth.
[191:24.46]Are you also suspicious of chemicals like chem drills?
[191:35.05]Wait, what happens when we get to 6G?
[191:41.82]We gotta be careful.
[191:42.56]We'll get to 6G, you'll sneeze and your brain will end up like shaking back and forth and like you'll end up knocking yourself out.
[191:51.76]From the micro vibrations.
[192:05.90]You just need to do the- What am I able to- Wait, am I- Am I just fucking not paying attention and fixing up their whole entire townhouse thing here?
[192:16.53]I'm fixing everything.
[192:17.57]I'm not supposed to be doing this.
[192:18.87]Okay.
[192:19.69]Just the- Alright.
[192:29.82]Ah!
[192:32.42]Ah!
[192:48.87]You're getting a nosebleed.
[192:52.91]This is not even high enough.
[193:00.88]I'm going to leave the scaffoldings because I don't care.
[193:04.64]You can take those down.
[193:14.98]Are those carrots?
[193:17.52]Wait, you can plant carrots in this game and I haven't even started doing it yet?
[193:24.88]I'm just fixing people's roofs and shit.
[193:26.79]Like, I want to build- I want to put carrots in the ground.
[193:44.40]What?
[193:46.01]You're destroying crops that grow.
[193:47.23]Harvest the crops before they grow.
[193:52.51]What are they talking about?
[194:01.32]I got a good view of my farm.
[194:02.48]They're talking about my farm?
[194:05.14]What's my worker doing?
[194:11.84]What's he doing over here?
[194:14.75]Why is he all the way over here?
[194:18.34]Are there binoculars?
[194:24.44]Can you climb the tower?
[194:26.06]Let's find out.
[194:38.57]Use the drone?
[194:40.19]Alright, that's sick!
[194:45.28]I sold the drone.
[194:46.12]I don't have it anymore.
[195:00.89]Alright, we're almost done.
[195:02.31]We've got one more panel to put on, and then maybe Joseph will throw a carrot to us.
[195:11.18]What else is left here?
[195:14.70]Oh, come on.
[195:17.96]Over here.
[195:18.30]Alright.
[195:26.76]Quest done.

[198:36.01]I can't disagree with that one.
[198:37.30]Alright, let's keep this up.
[198:41.90]This would take months to do.
[198:44.88]For your broken tractor in the backyard.
[198:46.58]This is two or three months of work.
[199:03.27]Alright.
[199:04.71]Close.

[199:32.74]What about- what happened to- I wear tomatoes.
[199:35.82]I do tomatoes.
[199:50.75]For the love of God, I really hope I don't have to do anything after this.
[199:54.22]Just give me the thing so I can do my own shit.
[200:16.72]Alright, the best part about this is the fact that this is, this right here is by far like the most tedious thing in the game.
[200:24.50]And I just did, I just did this to my own house.
[200:28.06]It took like an hour and a half to do this.
[200:30.38]And now it's, hey, let's do a quest.
[200:32.72]Alright, let's go talk to Janet.
[200:34.20]Do that again, but do it to my house.

[201:12.04]No, not it.
[201:13.40]Alright, this is gonna be it.
[201:16.66]The next person that wants me to fix their whole entire living space, I'm gonna say no.
[201:23.91]And I don't care.
[201:24.63]I will buy the vehicle.
[201:36.82]Finally.
[201:40.14]There you go, Janet.

[202:46.55]Just to put on different attachments?
[203:09.43]Which one is correct?
[203:16.74]Oh shit, I just made a battle bot.

[204:56.46]Because there's another, like, attachment back here.
[204:58.14]Alright, I don't want this one.
[205:01.50]This one's stupid.
[205:03.52]I don't want the claw.

[220:25.32]So, this is not Farming Simulator.
[220:28.16]This is Farmer's Apostrophe Dynasty.
[220:33.83]There's much more to do in your dynasty than just plant.
[220:37.66]Alright, let's go.

[221:21.78]So you're saying, what, just back it over here?
[221:23.35]Back it up?
[221:59.65]Do I have to actually drive brick by brick?
[222:03.29]No, I don't.
[222:11.18]What did that just say?
[222:11.78]It just said something.
[222:17.69]There were four options.
[222:18.55]What did it just say?
[222:22.05]Wait!
[222:22.61]Furniture store.
[222:32.00]Buy new home furniture for your bath, your kids, your kids room?

[222:46.59]Why am I already planning for children, for kids and shit when I don't even have a, I don't even have a girlfriend.
[222:53.84]Air bricks.
[222:54.80]Those are cool.
[223:10.28]Alright, uh, here's a train station.
[223:13.12]Place to meet people, trade, or ask for work.
[223:15.28]Yeah!
[223:29.21]Sell the bricks?
[223:32.03]They might just stay there.
[223:33.71]I think they're just gonna stay there for me to take whenever I want.
[223:40.51]They didn't despawn.
[224:03.96]Why am I going up the tree?
[224:05.38]I'm grinding the fuck out of this tree.
[224:09.89]Alright, train station.
[224:11.17]I can meet people at the train station.
[224:15.07]Okay.

[226:02.88]Why does it have to be probably not alcoholic?
[226:05.10]It is or it isn't.
[226:16.66]Alright, how much is this stuff?

[242:35.59]Lady, you look as beautiful as a sunny morning.
[242:39.87]Save it.
[242:40.63]I don't know you.
[242:41.47]Hello there.
[242:48.28]Good afternoon.
[242:52.40]I would have arrived earlier if I knew I'd meet a beauty like you.
[242:57.25]That's so sweet.
[242:58.23]You are really nice.
[242:59.47]Hi.
[243:04.83]Good afternoon.
[243:05.97]Does this keep going like this?
[243:07.63]I need a quest.
[243:09.26]Well, thank you.
[243:15.46]Is there a telephone in this game or anything?
[243:16.98]How do I get a phone number?
[243:21.10]Hello.
[243:21.74]Good afternoon.
[243:25.17]Is there something I can help you with?
[243:27.91]No, not at the moment.
[243:29.21]God damn it.
[243:32.71]Good luck.

[244:07.19]My truck is smoking?
[244:08.21]Yeah, I guess it is.
[244:11.85]That's a little weird.
[244:38.35]Oh fuck, oh fuck, I just blanked.
[244:41.19]I just was blanking out.
[244:42.47]No, I just lost the points that I just got.
[244:44.49]I mean, that's kind of funny, but... Ow!
[245:02.71]Oh, I'm okay.
[245:12.95]Where's the 5G?
[245:13.93]I got too close to the 5G tower.
[245:18.47]Easy turn.
[245:18.99]Do the field joke again.
[245:31.09]No, I gotta focus.
[245:32.11]I need to get to 50,000.
[245:32.73]I need another drone.
[245:35.09]I need to have a wife.
[245:36.57]I want to have kids.
[245:37.89]The whole reason why I'm doing this still, guys, is because I want to have a child.
[245:41.50]And then I want to teleport five, ten years in the future.
[245:44.38]That's the only reason why I'm still in the game!
[245:54.72]It shows the sex.
[245:55.92]It does not show the sex.
[245:59.21]I will put down $50 trillion that says it does not show you having sex on camera.
[246:15.62]In fact, I'm going to go sleep for a week after this.
[246:18.74]Yep.
[246:19.08]Because then I'll be able to come back, compliment... I'm going to go to Nelly, compliment her, sleep for a week, come back, compliment her.
[246:27.09]What's happening over here?
[246:27.73]There's people gathering.
[246:30.90]Friends?

[251:05.20]That's all.
[251:08.94]Are these people persistent?
[251:12.42]Are they not persistent?
[251:13.62]What if they leave?
[251:15.42]Did they just get auto-generated or something?
[251:17.49]Or are these people actually in the town?
[251:32.59]I'm just trying to go around.
[251:37.76]Okay, Jesus.
[251:42.42]This is harder to control than the drone.
[251:50.47]Is there- What's the train sound?
[251:52.01]Alright, here's your fucking package.
[252:03.88]I'm in the building again.
[252:04.80]God damn it.
[252:11.64]Okay, I don't, I don't, I will actually fucking softlock myself.
[252:14.71]This is not good.
[252:26.60]Here we go.
[252:28.34]Epic Rider.
[252:29.22]What do you got?
[252:38.77]Oh, you have a lot of shit.
[252:39.85]I don't know.
[252:40.71]Can I sell you something for way overpriced bullshit?
[252:44.25]What about a beer?
[252:47.97]No, I need a ring.
[252:49.37]I need a perfume.
[252:50.11]I need all this stuff.
[252:53.55]Get 15 pumpkins.
[252:55.01]I don't care.
[253:05.16]Oh, shit.
[253:05.66]Another congregation of people.
[253:08.11]Here's the package you requested.
[253:10.95]Thank you.
[253:11.67]Why am I 12 feet tall?
[253:16.27]What did it give me?
[253:16.79]1,000 social coins.
[253:20.43]I'm almost there.
[253:27.54]Hello there.
[253:28.30]It's me.
[253:29.70]Good evening.
[253:34.55]You look like the princess I've been looking for my entire life.
[253:39.53]Well, thank you.
[253:44.04]Care to talk?
[253:44.90]Hello.
[253:51.04]Is there something I can help you with?
[253:53.76]No.
[253:55.82]Did it hurt when you were falling from the sky?
[253:57.76]So nice to hear that.
[254:07.44]Okay, I need... 50,000 social points, right?
[254:12.34]How close are we?
[254:14.72]I got somebody.
[254:15.68]Somebody want something right around here?
[254:17.40]Anybody need anything?
[254:18.36]Right here.
[254:18.78]Okay.
[254:20.61]Deliver tomatoes.
[254:21.69]Sure, let's go.
[254:22.57]Right here, let's do it.
[254:29.65]Why would it hurt if you fell from the sky?
[254:34.18]Uh...
[254:35.70]Because you're falling 5,000 miles down?
[254:39.52]What are you talking about?
[254:53.45]Hi.
[254:53.97]Hmm?
[254:54.44]Uh... Nobody has any work.
[255:02.00]There are a shitload of people in this town.
[255:05.76]Seriously.
[255:06.64]There's so many people here.
[255:07.72]Good luck.
[255:08.43]What are you... Salma?
[255:15.39]It's me again.
[255:19.83]That's right.
[255:20.81]Save it.
[255:21.39]I...
[255:35.19]It does look like B.F. Bugleberry, you're right.
[255:43.62]People seem to pretend to know me, but not know me.
[255:47.82]Quest.
[256:01.81]Yes.
[256:02.55]I need some tomatoes, but can't go to the shop now.
[256:05.61]Will you bring me these?
[256:06.87]Absolutely.
[256:10.35]Sounds good.
[256:11.17]I'll take care of this.
[256:15.21]Yep.
[256:16.47]Deliver 20 tomatoes.
[256:17.94]I'll be right back.
[256:19.10]Stay right there.
[256:21.02]Not now.
[256:21.82]Sorry.
[256:23.42]Where's my car?
[256:25.60]Where's my car?
[256:37.65]Wait.
[256:39.15]I have to actually go get tomatoes.
[256:44.27]I just need 20 tomatoes.
[256:45.87]Wait, I have tomatoes growing in my garden!
[256:47.99]Alright, we're gonna go sleep for a week and then come back.
[257:18.92]Go back home.
[257:20.74]Let's work on those tomatoes.
[257:30.07]Won't your tomatoes die if they're not watered?
[257:33.61]They should be okay.
[257:36.11]But I don't care.
[257:37.71]A tomato is a tomato in this game.
[257:42.31]They could be rotten for all that she cares.
[257:46.19]As long as there's 20 of them.
[257:47.59]Who cares?
[258:01.87]We'll go to sleep and see if we have any tomatoes to harvest.
[258:15.10]Alright, home sweet home.
[258:15.88]Here we are.
[258:24.10]Wait a minute.
[258:24.46]Look at this shit.
[258:26.34]I didn't... I'm gonna... Remember when I planted these?
[258:30.41]Yeah, I remember I planted these.
[258:31.57]They're actually here.
[258:33.15]That's cool.
[258:35.17]We get the first harvest of apples!
[258:36.67]Cool!
[258:40.91]All that hard work paid off.
[258:49.57]Tomato tree.
[258:50.85]I can sell these too.
[258:55.82]Anybody need an apple?
[258:56.92]Or want an apple?
[259:02.27]I get the rest later.
[259:02.95]Let's check on the tomatoes.
[259:08.93]It's comfortable in here.
[259:18.20]How long does this shit take to grow?
[259:29.79]Okay, goodnight.
[259:48.38]Nice!
[259:49.20]Alright!
[259:57.71]Looks a lot better.
[260:04.52]Plus, I just want to get rid of these.
[260:11.10]You know what I kind of always wanted to try?
[260:14.77]something about it it's the way that like the the slosh like goes on the you you slurp the uh you spread the slosh on the alright let me try to let me slow down for a second here let me pause it because it's hard for me to even get this up when you lay bricks and you get the little scooper and you like you slosh like that paste the cement down you stick it on there I feel like that would be I want to try it
[260:45.70]You get that bucket of just... You get the little scooper and you just... And then you glue them together.
[261:11.14]Being like a brick Mason, I think... I mean, it's a hard job.
[261:15.58]But I kind of want... I want to, like, just do it once.
[261:18.76]I want to... Look, let me put it this way.
[261:20.94]I want to do... To be a brick Mason for as long as it takes to go from here to here.
[261:26.25]And then be like, that was fun.
[261:27.41]I'm done.
[261:36.09]Cool.
[261:36.45]Alright, let's go.
[261:37.61]Look, I got... Ooh!
[261:38.83]Hold on.
[261:39.42]Nobody...
[261:55.77]Just do it?
[261:56.19]What do you mean just do it?
[261:59.05]I actually can replace all of my shitty stuff.
[262:06.67]Okay, I'm glad you can do that.
[262:13.09]How many bricks do I even have left?
[262:34.70]Oh, that's how many I have.
[262:37.71]Alright, bedtime.
[262:50.74]Okay.
[262:51.38]Check on tomatoes.
[262:52.12]If the tomatoes aren't ready, I'm going to sleep for a week.
[263:13.75]Why does my wallpaper look like that?
[263:15.01]Alright, it's not gonna go to bed for a week.
[263:22.34]How long?
[263:22.66]This is gonna take a million years.
[263:24.20]Can I just buy tomatoes?
[263:25.22]I'm just gonna go buy them.
[263:26.90]Alright, I'm gonna go buy tomatoes.
[263:32.64]Who sells tomatoes?
[263:46.18]I need to mark it.
[263:53.92]General store.
[263:55.50]No, he didn't sell tomatoes.
[264:00.22]Vehicle store.
[264:06.74]Is there only one general store?
[264:10.00]Agriculture.
[264:10.56]Alright, we're going here.
[264:12.37]For the sole reason that I want to see if I can buy any animals.
[264:23.77]The 5G tower lady sells tomatoes?
[264:25.49]That's right!
[264:26.15]You're right, you're right, you're right.
[264:29.23]5G tower lady does sell tomatoes.
[264:36.15]Where's her farm?
[264:42.66]Which one?
[264:43.02]I don't even remember where the fuck it was.
[264:48.50]Where's the 5G tower?
[265:02.24]Let us click.
[265:04.08]By lakeside?
[265:04.88]Is it down here?
[265:13.57]Like this way?
[265:14.95]What's going on?
[265:18.07]What just happened?
[265:20.47]Where am I?
[265:26.66]Okay, that was weird.
[265:29.83]Is it over here?
[265:31.21]Where's that 5G tower?
[265:44.76]It's where I left my corn header?
[265:52.18]Over here?
[266:02.36]I need my truck.
[266:04.91]Why am I over... What happened to me?
[266:08.89]This fast travel in this game and I didn't even know about it?
[266:23.69]So why don't I just park this across the whole world?
[266:38.14]This seriously can't be the place that I get stuck.
[266:44.64]Into the fucking river.
[266:47.75]Just do it.
[266:48.79]It's not that hard.
[266:49.53]Alright, we're just going to find the 5G tower and we find it.
[267:03.43]Yeah, what's the point of even... I'm going to just put my tractor on one side and put the...
[267:08.81]Car on the other side.
[267:20.33]They're fine, don't worry.
[267:25.00]Death stranding looks weird on PC.
[267:30.10]Yeah.
[267:31.38]Yep.
[267:33.06]Alright, 5G tower.
[267:37.09]Where's the 5G tower?
[267:40.86]It's over here somewhere.
[267:50.41]Where's the 5G tower?
[268:08.86]Still on Tutorial Island.
[268:11.68]Where is this place?
[268:12.46]I just have no fucking idea.
[268:18.86]I have no idea.
[268:27.20]That's it right here.
[268:28.96]You know how I know?
[268:33.34]Because everything is done, completely built up, and looks nice except for this one, because that's the one I didn't do, right?
[268:38.83]Isn't it right here?
[268:43.00]No, never mind, it's not.
[268:48.61]Fuck!
[268:49.91]Where is this person that sells the tomatoes?
[268:52.49]Ugh.
[268:55.45]God damn it.
[268:56.65]It's over here somewhere.
[268:57.67]Over here?
[268:58.49]Over here?
[269:00.41]It wasn't up here.
[269:04.57]How can I not see the tower from here?
[269:31.60]Wasn't it right next to the first farm?
[269:33.13]Wait, what do you mean right next to the first farm?
[269:36.37]Like over here?
[269:37.09]I should have kept a damn drone so I could have been able to see where I was going.
[269:45.89]Does the gas station explode?
[269:48.64]Not even a good game.
[270:01.76]Yeah, I think you're right.
[270:02.98]I think it was the one right next to my house.
[270:05.62]Was it, though?
[270:06.62]I don't remember.
[270:10.84]I don't see any... There it is.
[270:22.13]Tomato time.
[270:31.24]Farmer's dynasty.
[270:34.94]Haven't done a single fucking thing to have nothing to do with farming.
[270:39.82]Have done absolute zero to do with anything to do with being a farmer.
[270:45.09]In four and a half hours.
[270:49.29]I plowed a field once.
[270:51.73]That's it.
[271:03.36]God.
[271:03.94]Give me a break.
[271:04.94]I'm just gonna go all the way back.
[271:08.83]And then turn it.
[271:10.11]And go this way.
[271:16.81]Everything just has so much... Just fucking walk.
[271:21.79]Whatever.
[271:22.09]I'll buy a new one.
[271:25.07]Where's the tower?
[271:26.95]All I care about is that tower.
[271:29.06]It's this way, right?
[271:30.02]Where was it?
[271:30.90]Why is it not spawned in?
[271:33.12]Alright, hey.
[271:35.08]Excuse me.
[271:37.27]I'm here for the, uh, tomato.
[271:39.27]This is my house.
[272:02.12]Those 5G signals are melting his brain.
[272:04.62]Okay, but let me be fair though.
[272:15.36]I planted tomatoes, right?
[272:18.41]How long ago was that?
[272:20.53]Do I just have to actually go to bed for like 10 straight days for them to grow?
[272:30.17]hey hey hey hey excuse me I'm busy not now sorry I'm busy hi there so nice to see you you are so beautiful I wish I dream about you tonight it is so nice to hear wait a minute what really hi so nice to see you wait did it work
[272:59.38]Janet, how do you not have any tomatoes?
[273:12.05]You have apples and pumpkins and zucchinis.
[273:15.10]I thought you were a tomato farmer.
[273:20.64]Aren't you growing tomatoes?
[273:28.63]What are you doing?
[273:33.76]Do you have them?
[273:35.08]Good morning.
[273:36.12]Do you have any... I came all the way down here for tomatoes.
[273:39.46]I was led astray.
[273:40.16]No, not at the moment.
[273:58.39]No flower is as beautiful as you are.
[274:00.79]It is so nice to hear.
[274:04.93]But she really likes me.
[274:05.77]How do I go on a date or something?
[274:08.45]Do you seriously not have any fucking tomatoes in your whole house?
[274:12.24]What am I doing here then?
[274:13.42]You just have apples.
[274:15.66]What am I doing here?
[274:32.49]I need 20 tomatoes.
[274:43.80]Does the general store sell them?
[274:45.54]It might.
[274:52.06]I think it's apples.
[274:54.06]Just go to sleep and go back tomorrow.
[274:56.91]If I sleep for a week, I might lose the...
[275:02.49]I might lose the job.
[275:13.54]Hold on.
[275:21.76]Do you have tomatoes?
[275:22.94]Good to see you.
[275:23.72]Do you have 20 of them?
[275:26.56]Care to trade?
[275:27.34]Sure.
[275:30.00]No, this guy doesn't have any tomatoes.
[275:32.96]He has the super drone and he... No.
[275:36.00]No tomatoes.
[275:46.20]Alright, I'm going to sleep for a week.
[275:48.48]Fuck it.
[276:08.18]Sell you wheat every day?
[276:09.94]Unfortunately, I can't hire a worker to do it because I'm not cool enough to hire people.
[276:28.50]What a nice rest.
[276:30.33]Weather effects?
[276:31.05]No way.
[276:31.49]Let's see.
[276:41.57]This house sucks so bad, I can't even leave it.
[276:45.53]Imagine if your entire fucking house, your entire house, was wallpapered like this.
[276:53.22]You'd get lost in every room.
[276:56.38]Every single part of the house is this weird grandma flower paper.
[277:03.68]Tomatoes, check them.
[277:06.82]What is this, a beehive?
[277:09.62]Place for birds?
[277:10.54]What is this?
[277:10.96]What is it?
[277:11.26]I don't even know what it's for.
[277:24.23]Go back to bed.
[277:24.89]Go back to bed.
[277:26.73]Go back to sleep.
[277:31.25]I'm sleeping.
[277:31.83]I'm gonna save it.
[277:32.39]I'm gonna sleep for two weeks.
[277:41.84]Who gives a shit?
[277:44.24]Nobody cares about me in this town anyways.
[278:08.23]Alright, let's go.
[278:13.68]Let's harvest the tomatoes.
[278:33.07]How are these not ready?
[279:00.85]Water them?
[279:01.39]They're already watered.
[279:02.29]They're in a comfortable wet position.
[279:23.22]What year is it?
[279:26.40]You haven't watered them for weeks?
[279:27.78]It's a greenhouse!
[279:30.09]You're not gonna go in here with, like, a spray bottle.
[279:32.28]Oh, look at me!
[279:34.46]Look at me!
[279:35.22]You gotta water the baby!
[279:36.20]It's a greenhouse!
[279:38.88]Look!
[279:45.63]Tomatoes, let's go!
[279:48.17]How many?
[279:50.45]Twelve tomatoes.
[279:51.57]Oh, fuck yeah.
[280:00.65]114 tomatoes.
[280:01.95]I'm going to be a quadrillionaire.
[280:09.64]Let's just hope that... I don't even know her name.
[280:29.33]You mean avoid the- I'm damaging my vehicle?
[280:39.04]You're getting hungry.
[280:39.76]Well, good thing I got 114 tomatoes.
[280:52.38]It actually is truly stuck.
[280:55.67]I'm thinking maybe turn the wheel all the way this way.
[280:57.43]Because what is... I'm hitting the tree.
[281:01.45]Hold on.
[281:05.21]Alright, I'm hitting the base of the tree and it's fucking it all up.
[281:08.15]This is over.
[281:09.11]I can't get this out.
[281:11.68]I need to drone it.
[281:13.68]But I don't have a drone anymore.
[281:15.46]God damn it.
[281:16.48]I don't have a drone.
[281:17.40]I'm going to sell a bunch of tomatoes to the guy and... Alright, I'm going to drone that out.
[281:22.40]You're right.
[281:22.78]Good idea.
[281:32.34]I'm gonna sell this guy, like, 70 tomatoes.
[281:34.92]Alright.
[281:35.28]How many price per... That's terrible.
[281:37.74]That's it?
[282:01.82]Not even worth selling them.
[282:04.27]It's like a hundred bucks.
[282:11.27]They're just tomatoes.
[282:14.27]They're the best tomatoes.
[282:15.45]They're the finest tomatoes you can buy.
[282:16.80]Ooh.
[282:21.06]This is expensive.
[282:22.60]What do I need?
[282:25.48]Seventeen.
[282:25.92]I'm just going to buy them.
[282:26.72]Who cares?
[282:28.20]Just give me the fucking little baby drone.
[282:29.89]I'm done.
[282:30.97]I'll come back later.
[282:33.38]Alright, let's go get this thing out.
[283:22.78]I'm going to go from the other side.
[283:25.44]This moves cars so radically on the road.
[283:42.05]You want to see my thought process?
[283:43.65]Watch this.
[283:44.27]Those of you that weren't here.
[283:45.09]Ow!
[283:47.24]Those of you that weren't here like an hour ago...
[283:52.83]That's my thought process.
[283:54.21]Alright?
[284:05.24]This car doesn't even exist.
[284:12.61]One more idea.
[284:42.97]Push it with the tractor?
[284:44.05]I have to go get the tractor.
[284:46.83]Hold on.
[285:03.68]That's what I need.
[285:04.26]Right there.
[285:06.04]Oh, for the love of God.
[285:06.76]Just give me the damn tractor and just come back.
[285:10.66]Where's my tractor?
[285:25.34]This is possibly the stupidest stream on Twitch right now.
[285:32.88]I'm trying to get my fucking car back.
[285:36.60]What do you think I'm trying to do?
[285:41.82]Full speed!
[285:53.09]This isn't enough, dude.
[286:05.24]Who would have guessed?
[286:06.14]Actually not me because these wheels are fucking enormous.
[286:08.90]The wheels are huge.
[286:18.72]Where's my harvester?
[286:19.72]That thing is huge.
[286:21.00]That's really big.
[286:24.69]Where's the harvester?
[286:43.49]That's so far away.
[286:44.71]Is this water?
[286:46.32]Okay, get out of the water.
[286:48.58]Out of the water.
[287:08.55]Like, this guy sucks.
[287:10.56]I wouldn't want to know this guy either.
[287:14.81]Imagine you ran a business.
[287:17.51]You had a general store.
[287:19.63]And somebody was flying their drone trying to like flip cars in front of your business.
[287:25.90]And got two vehicles stuck in a river in front of your business.
[287:30.92]And then you find out and you hear through, you know, through gossip that he's on his way back right now with a giant tractor.
[287:40.99]And he's going to try to get both of his cars out.
[287:45.27]What are you gonna do?
[287:45.91]What do you do?
[287:47.47]You call police?
[287:55.47]Harvest the grass.
[288:08.18]You just record it.
[288:08.94]Yeah, that's true.
[288:10.78]You would just record it.
[288:14.59]You would make an entire YouTube channel around this person.
[288:17.51]And they wouldn't even know.
[288:22.65]You'd be able to get permission from this person really, really easy.
[288:27.55]You'd be like, hey, dude.
[288:28.91]Hey, what's up?
[288:30.41]Hey, do you care if I, like, upload, like, the shit that you're doing to YouTube?
[288:34.72]Yeah, fuck it.
[288:35.36]That's fucking awesome, dude.
[288:37.74]Yeah, go for it, man.
[288:39.40]Okay.
[288:40.20]And, like, record yourself doing that.
[288:44.29]That'd be very easy.
[288:47.51]I don't give a shit.
[288:51.74]Thank you.
[288:57.64]What am I moving too fast?
[289:09.14]And, like, what's a month when you get, like, paid out from YouTube?
[289:12.48]And you take your, like, your, like, $8,900 a month you're gonna make from this guy?
[289:18.79]Just, like, be like, Hey!
[289:20.75]Hey, what is it?
[289:22.89]Hey, man, um, do you want, like, a hundred bucks?
[289:25.81]What the fuck?
[289:26.93]Oh, yeah, that sounds good to me.
[289:29.17]I'll take a hundred dollars right now.
[289:33.26]Keep doing your thing.
[289:34.88]Oh, I will.
[289:37.72]Thank you, sir.
[289:49.22]Yeah, this one's stuck.
[289:54.47]There's another point, though.
[289:56.27]This guy probably has a lot of money.
[290:00.09]You don't lose a truck, and then a tractor, in a moat, and then come back with a $400,000 piece of machinery to remove it.
[290:09.96]This guy has a lot of money.
[290:13.47]I'm going the wrong way?
[290:14.63]What?
[290:29.05]No, he doesn't have any money.
[290:30.01]He just has, like, a bunch of loans?
[290:32.03]No.
[290:34.54]That's not... Wait, what do you mean Star is wrong?
[290:41.88]No, it's not.
[290:42.28]This is where all my shit is.
[290:58.86]He'd see you with the money.
[291:00.54]Like, you have a briefcase.
[291:17.49]He don't know.
[291:17.99]He doesn't know.
[291:18.57]I need to go ramming speed.
[291:19.81]I don't have any crops.
[291:22.67]Yeah, because I'm not cool enough to have them planted by anybody.
[291:25.58]I need... I just want...
[291:27.81]Look, I'm just trying to get tomatoes here.
[291:29.59]Alright, let me line this up.
[291:44.50]Put it down.
[292:05.42]I don't think you can get them out.
[292:09.52]Guys, this one's too big to get stuck, I think.
[292:12.71]They can't be moved.
[292:14.95]They actually can't be moved.
[292:16.19]They're cemented to the ground.
[292:31.80]Yep.
[292:32.66]No, they're here forever.
[292:35.02]No, I can't get them.
[292:37.42]Oh well.
[292:39.54]Let's turn this back up.
[292:41.73]Let's get out of here.
[292:46.17]Ram into the truck from the tree side.
[292:48.21]No, it's got solid collision.
[292:49.87]I can't.
[292:57.23]I will give it one attempt.
[292:58.37]We're going to detach this.
[293:02.33]So it's just a ram.
[293:05.33]Stop spinning this thing.
[293:07.77]Drop it.
[293:09.55]Alright.
[293:10.53]Now it's just an actual ram.
[293:16.55]Go get the tow truck?
[293:19.70]What do you mean, get the tow truck?
[293:21.08]Alright, I gotta line it up.
[293:30.23]How do you softlock yourself in Farmer's Destiny?
[293:32.98]I don't know.
[293:35.88]You try to drive over a moat that has a tree in it.
[293:38.90]Hold on, can I cut this tree down with a chainsaw?
[293:42.39]Oh, fuck, man.
[293:43.37]I think I can cut the tree down with a chainsaw.
[294:04.66]Well, this is our car now.
[294:26.33]Wait, I can dig myself out.
[294:28.29]I'm gonna dig myself out.
[294:41.32]I think it's gonna work.
[294:49.68]It's just like snow.
[294:54.20]You gotta get your back tire free.
[295:09.49]Okay, let's try that.
[295:12.27]Other side.
[295:20.64]Right there.
[295:21.36]Okay, let's try it.
[295:28.07]Oh, I'm gonna go off.
[295:33.67]Oh, don't ever tell me my ideas are wrong.
[295:36.94]This is gonna work.
[296:02.82]Ugh, you motherfucker.
[296:12.37]Turn sharp left when going forward.
[296:16.89]I can't.
[296:19.95]I might be able to... I'm going to brute force out.
[296:25.23]Come on.
[296:25.81]It's going.
[296:27.73]Please.
[296:36.30]Drone.
[296:37.74]Drone can fit under there.
[296:58.40]Come on.
[297:01.90]Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it!
[297:19.46]Oh, fuck off!
[297:39.59]Call the tow truck in the tab menu?
[297:41.39]What are you talking about?
[297:53.70]Does this person still want their tomatoes?
[297:56.38]I hope so.
[297:59.16]Dig in front of the truck.
[298:00.48]I can't dig in front of the truck because it's not grass.
[298:03.70]It doesn't count.
[298:04.81]See?
[298:28.93]It said tow truck in the menu.
[298:32.73]Where are you seeing tow truck?
[298:36.73]What are you talking about?
[298:43.46]There's no tow truck in the menu.
[298:45.10]Please get me out of this.
[299:11.18]I need these things.
[299:13.74]I need these things.
[299:14.81]I have to... Holy shit!
[299:29.36]There is a tow truck!
[299:30.54]There is a tow truck!
[299:32.70]Oh my god!
[299:34.30]Are you serious?
[299:36.48]No, it is not!
[299:37.80]No way!
[299:39.79]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[299:45.20]Wow.
[299:46.58]Unbelievable.
[299:47.72]Un-fucking-believable.
[299:49.08]Well, I just wasted like 40 minutes.
[300:09.96]Let's go.
[300:34.86]Hello there.

[300:43.40]What's going on?
[301:10.59]I'm gonna need that tow truck again.
[301:25.60]Tomato delivery incoming.
[301:26.90]I feel like I'm playing DayZ.
[301:35.89]Or like PUBG or something.
[301:43.59]Not great music choice, but you know.
[301:46.93]Same car mechanics.
[302:05.56]I think it's got some air.
[302:10.92]I'm here!
[302:12.58]I'm here, I made it!
[302:13.44]What's she running away from?
[302:16.30]Is she being chased?
[302:23.95]I'm coming!
[302:30.24]I'm coming!
[302:32.96]Is somebody like chasing behind her?
[302:36.36]Somebody's chasing her!
[302:42.68]Thank you.
[302:43.78]Here's something for you.
[302:44.86]Was it me the whole time?
[302:54.05]Wait, was it me?
[302:55.15]There was somebody else.
[302:56.99]It's just been me.
[302:57.79]Hello there.
[303:03.83]No, there he is.
[303:04.47]Good morning.

[303:13.43]So nice to hear that.
[303:14.49]Thanks.
[303:18.95]Still don't even care to talk.

[303:26.01]Is there something I can help you with?
[303:28.75]No, not.
[303:29.79]Thanks.

[303:50.28]I need 50.
[303:51.00]I need more social points.
[303:52.40]Who is this?
[303:53.14]Frank?
[303:54.48]50 social points that I'm worth by time.
[303:56.54]50.
[304:00.21]That's it?
[304:05.83]New quest available.
[304:06.93]Spicy pumpkin soup.
[304:08.35]I don't have that.
[304:09.51]That's not available to me.
[304:12.81]I'll do a transport quest.
[304:18.56]There was a ghost behind me.
[304:19.58]What was that?
[304:29.26]Buy new property and fix it up for social points.
[304:31.32]I don't have enough money to buy any property.
[304:34.24]I have to... I'm going to go do it on my own.
[304:36.06]I'm going to go put... What?
[304:39.78]No.

[304:40.89]I don't want Frank.
[304:44.32]I have to go bring my tractor back and harvest and plant some seeds.
[304:51.02]Where am I going?
[304:52.06]Can I fit through that?

[314:07.40]Coming in too hot.
[314:20.51]Exit the drone.
[314:31.15]This guy ain't going anywhere for a long time.
[314:35.09]The road's made out of putty.
[314:40.93]Should I stuff them into the ground?
[314:43.29]Stack the vans.
[315:11.19]That's gonna be fucking hard to do.
[315:14.73]Why are they reading poetry over here?
[315:16.45]That's no surprise.
[315:50.38]Flip him this way.
[316:05.26]No, stop escaping.
[316:08.02]He's in.
[316:14.54]He's in, and he's stuck.

[319:56.70]You could have got an extra half hour in bed.
[320:02.82]One day, it'll all be different.
[320:08.93]Promises, promises.
[320:10.13]But do they work?
[320:11.53]Don't think so.
[320:31.67]I can't move this guy anymore.
[320:34.82]I forgot I was streaming.
[320:35.74]Okay, well, hold on.

[322:52.41]I think I have to stop playing the game.
[322:56.11]I can't stop.
[322:56.95]I have to be ready for him.
[323:06.93]Alright, perfect opportunity.
[323:12.94]On the fucking roof.
[323:13.76]Let's go, boys and girls.
[323:25.71]He slipped off.

[324:04.34]Okay, let me try.
[324:05.16]Damn it.
[324:14.32]That's so tricky to get right underneath.
[324:16.92]Like that.
[324:17.51]Like that.
[324:18.19]Like that.
[324:18.61]Slow it.
[324:19.17]Ah, fuck.
[324:21.17]It's so slippery.
[324:22.07]It's so hard to get it.
[324:28.21]Get him on the roof of Riot.
[324:30.67]I'm trying my best.
[324:37.78]No, he's stuck forever.
[324:59.36]It's gotta be up a little bit.
[325:14.67]You couldn't have made this any better for me, could you?
[325:26.18]and it might change for the better somehow.
[326:02.24]I just turtled him again.
[326:03.28]I'll try this.
[326:21.79]I need to get him on the roof, but I can't.
[326:23.01]I have to stop.
[326:23.82]What if I turn the volume down?
[326:24.80]Is that gonna...
[326:46.18]Oh, god damn it!
[326:49.32]I had him!
[326:53.86]It's so hard to keep it steady.
[327:02.32]Because it just rips around in so many directions.
[327:10.36]Alright, I'm going to play the game.
[327:11.81]I have to play the game now.
[327:18.67]I have to stop.
[327:20.53]I will sit here for like three days and do this.
[327:24.59]My brain is so fucked up.
[327:25.91]I will be here all day.
[327:27.25]Last chance.
[327:27.73]Here we go.
[327:28.05]This is the last opportunity.
[327:43.16]No, the roof!
[327:44.04]Oh, fuck.
[327:50.28]No, it's gonna kill me!
[327:52.66]It's gonna kill me!
[327:53.60]He's right here!
[327:54.60]Oh, it's too hard to control.
[328:13.52]It really is.
[328:14.46]It's so difficult.
[328:22.00]Shh, hold on.
[328:23.24]Quiet.
[328:49.15]Oh my god, I'm gonna lose my mind.
[328:50.41]I have to do this.
[328:51.77]I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.
[328:52.71]I did it twice.
[329:04.26]Oh, it's so difficult.
[329:06.60]This is harder than the last boss in Sekiro.
[329:27.68]Nope.
[329:28.22]Nope.
[329:28.68]It's gotta be in one fucking swoop.
[329:30.96]It has to be perfect.
[329:37.14]He'll turn around.
[329:40.14]Go slower?
[329:40.90]I can't.
[329:44.22]Trust me.
[329:44.70]Trust me.
[329:46.00]Look, trust the guy that's been doing this for two hours.
[329:49.28]Trust me.
[329:55.12]Nope.
[329:55.94]Wasn't perfect.
[330:04.96]Because to be able to get under in the first place, you have to go fast enough for the game to... Why am I even explaining this?
[330:10.12]Why am I even describing what I have to do?
[330:12.46]Can I use a controller?
[330:13.40]I'd probably be harder.
[330:18.07]What is the joke here?
[330:18.91]There is none.
[330:26.89]I just want to pick him up and put him on the roof.
[330:29.76]This is not a joke.
[330:30.64]I just like how my brain is just fucking fried and I have to do this.
[330:47.85]I'm, like, leaning back on my chair and shit.
[330:49.31]My hands are sweating.
[330:56.28]You see how I have to glitch into the ground?
[330:58.58]Alright.
[330:59.10]This is not a terrible opportunity here.
[331:02.00]And you gotta get near the back wheels directly right in the middle of the car.
[331:08.55]Nope.
[331:08.85]I fucked it up.
[331:15.05]Nope.
[331:15.23]It's over.
[331:32.52]No.
[331:39.46]It's so fucking hard.
[331:40.86]Because you have to go up and then like scream down so you get into the ground.
[331:49.01]And then you're already going fast.
[331:50.71]Fuck.
[331:51.09]Roof van?
[331:52.53]What are you talking about?
[331:57.99]He's got it.
[331:58.39]He's got it.
[331:58.79]No, he doesn't.
[332:12.08]Shit It's too hard it is too impossible I'm here for the package Sure here it is
[333:08.56]First run.
[333:11.40]I gotta get him on the roof from here.
[333:12.90]Can I just fly him?
[333:31.11]Let's see if I can fly him carefully.
[333:36.85]I don't think I can fly them carefully.
[333:38.19]No.
[333:42.53]No, you can't.
[333:43.91]You can't do it.
[333:45.10]It's not possible.
[333:46.40]You can't move them at all.
[333:48.04]You can't move them at all.
[333:49.14]I have to fling them.
[334:07.82]package for my car in my car I have package let's back my car I don't know how long I did that for but I had to I had to try
[334:39.48]I had to try to get it on the roof.
[334:42.08]I wanted it on the roof so bad, because he would have probably... I'm disappointed right now.
[334:49.62]There's no payoff.
[334:52.20]Oh, I'm unfulfilled.
[334:54.18]I need to fulfill myself.
[334:55.36]How do I do that?
[334:56.22]I'm completely unfulfilled.
[335:02.98]That's the kind of shit that you have nightmares over.
[335:11.28]Here's the package you requested.
[335:14.12]Thank you.
[335:15.24]Here's something for you.
[335:22.13]We can't let him get away with this.
[335:25.61]Alright, 50,000 points.
[335:27.03]Time for a girlfriend.
[335:32.53]Time to go socialize with 50,000 points.
[335:34.69]Now, check this out.
[335:35.72]Let's do it.
[335:37.52]Hire.
[335:37.88]I want to...
[335:42.08]Uh, what if I should do... corn?
[335:46.36]I plowed it, cultivate it, and then corn.
[335:54.72]Should I do corn?
[335:56.26]Or do I need to cultivate it?
[335:57.78]Fertilize and then corn?
[336:03.58]Do I need to do that?
[336:04.53]Do I need to fertilize or cult... Can I just do it... Do I have to... Can I just click on make corn, please?
[336:12.75]Cultivate.
[336:15.71]Alright, good.
[336:18.49]Now let's go make a friend.
[336:41.51]Care to talk?
[336:43.48]Hello.
[336:47.16]You are so beautiful.
[336:48.76]I wish I'd dream about you tonight.
[336:52.08]What's with that sweet talk?
[336:57.59]Hi.
[336:58.01]Good afternoon.
[337:01.81]Hello, beauty.
[337:02.85]So nice to see you.
[337:05.46]That's so sweet.
[337:12.87]I need a quest or something.
[337:14.57]Does anybody actually like me yet?
[337:20.39]Yeah, that was like a synchronized tea.
[337:22.51]Good afternoon.
[337:26.70]This is a really nice place to live.
[337:28.68]Yes, it is nice.
[337:29.70]And all good folk live in here.
[337:32.52]You really look beautiful today.
[337:34.52]So nice to hear.
[337:58.44]I'm out of gas?
[338:41.16]I need a- I- I need somebody that'll like me!
[338:52.49]What did- I just did the same thing you did!
[338:55.17]Why did I do the same thing you did?
[338:58.73]What was I doing that for?
[339:28.89]Oof.
[339:29.77]Don't work.
[339:34.37]Any quests?
[339:35.15]Any people?
[339:35.97]Any friends?
[339:36.63]Any family?
[339:41.33]Search for mushrooms.
[339:43.29]Drone race.
[339:44.04]Let's go.
[339:49.88]The tomato lady?
[339:55.84]Wait, where am I?
[339:58.77]There's a bus right there.
[339:59.81]Who cares?
[340:00.15]Let's drive.
[340:02.45]I don't have a racing drone.
[340:03.39]Never mind.
[340:03.79]Alright, we're going to, uh... Right here.
[340:16.87]See?
[340:17.05]Because Tomato Lady had a smiley face on us.
[340:19.59]Okay, I don't know how that happened.
[340:24.14]The game just ripped me that way.
[340:26.94]My front alignment is... Okay, I'm seriously... My front alignment's fucked up.
[340:32.87]The tomato girl thinks I'm cool.
[340:34.19]Yeah.
[340:35.33]Let's go back there.
[340:50.16]I'm... You're seriously hungry.
[340:55.49]Imagine eating seven tomatoes.
[341:00.45]Just raw.
[341:11.45]How fucked up is this person?
[341:12.63]He's driving around not even on the roads.
[341:14.95]Eating raw tomatoes.
[341:16.55]Losing his cars.
[341:18.39]Flipping people off with drones.
[341:21.26]This guy's a menace.
[341:51.18]There's no sound effects.
[341:52.24]There's no... That's my dog!
[341:53.30]What are you doing with my dog?
[341:55.38]This is my house.
[341:55.96]No, it's not.
[341:57.80]What are you doing with my dog?
[342:01.68]This is my dog.
[342:07.32]Where are you?
[342:16.21]Wrong house.
[342:22.01]That's my dog.
[342:23.25]What's my dog even doing over here?
[342:27.39]Plow the field area.
[342:28.63]New quest.
[342:29.31]I'll take it.
[342:29.71]I'm right here.
[342:34.26]Excuse me.
[342:34.72]Watch out.
[342:36.24]I don't want to hit the dog.
[342:37.08]Alright, this shit isn't right here.
[343:02.64]A fucking monster.
[343:16.50]Oh, good day.
[343:18.02]Wait.
[343:33.11]Can I help you, sweetheart?
[343:34.95]Oh, it's Clara.
[343:35.71]I'm kind of green.
[343:36.85]Can you tell me a bit about field work?
[343:38.71]Sure.
[343:43.33]Thanks.
[343:43.69]Never mind.
[343:49.55]Alright, plow which field?
[343:50.93]This one here.
[343:56.41]This one here?
[343:56.99]Alright, let's do some farm work.
[344:03.36]Who has the quest?
[344:04.02]You?
[344:04.84]You?
[344:07.68]Which one of you guys actually has this quest?
[344:09.04]Uh... New quest.
[344:10.06]Plow the field.
[344:33.36]But who is giving this to me?
[344:34.42]I don't understand.
[344:36.63]There's nobody here to give this to me.
[344:43.67]Hey.
[344:43.89]Bruun, let's talk.
[344:45.03]Uh, you have work?
[344:49.92]Is this yours?
[344:50.74]No.
[344:59.43]Okay, goodbye.
[345:01.33]Is this yours?
[345:01.97]Whose is this?
[345:02.87]Hello there.
[345:06.19]Is there something I can help you with?
[345:07.91]There's a field nearby that needs plowing.
[345:10.50]Will you do it?
[345:12.22]Unbelievable.
[345:13.24]Yeah, I'll do it.
[345:14.16]Sounds good.
[345:16.68]Plow the field.
[345:19.26]This one right here.
[345:24.72]Shit, I need to plow.
[345:47.86]Where's my equipment?
[345:57.73]No.
[345:57.95]It's over here.
[346:05.47]Old machine.
[346:06.13]Grass mower.
[346:08.65]Wow, there it is.
[346:10.76]Alright, let's get the plow.
[346:12.48]Let's do some actual work, for God's sake.
[346:17.29]Jeremiah, I feel like this stream is going to kill me.
[346:23.20]Hang in there.
[346:25.48]I know what that's like, man.
[346:26.64]Let me help you out here.
[347:02.93]Alright, you're good.
[347:05.89]Saved.
[347:06.27]I saved your life.
[347:09.99]Give me $500.
[347:10.81]Now.
[347:11.13]Alright, plow that field.
[347:28.29]Where are my plow stuff?
[347:30.31]Over here, right?
[347:34.60]That's a plow, right?
[347:36.02]Is this a plow?
[347:38.54]This is a plow, isn't it?
[347:42.39]Holy shit, I... Somebody harvest this shit.
[347:47.69]This is mine.
[347:48.45]Somebody harvest this.
[347:51.50]What the hell are you doing over there?
[348:15.30]Drone these guys.
[348:16.41]No, don't fuck me up.
[348:51.89]Somebody coming?
[349:01.32]Somebody will do it.
[349:01.92]Alright.
[349:10.74]No, I'm doing my job.
[349:12.18]I'm doing my goddamn job.
[349:19.39]I don't remember where it was.
[349:23.46]There it is.
[349:46.17]Uh... I wish I could float.
[349:47.37]I can't just press a go-go gadget, inspect a gadget button, and float over that and just drive over this.
[350:06.23]It's not even worth doing.
[350:09.03]This is the second farm thing you've done in almost eight hours.
[350:11.93]Well, six, but... Yeah.
[350:19.28]Six hours ago.
[350:21.32]Yes.
[350:22.46]I did plow stuff.
[350:25.62]And then, after some time went by... I...
[350:33.23]You can't throw something like that at me and not have me look and not have me do something about it.
[350:47.77]That person's just out walking their car.
[350:51.51]Oh, we almost hit the pole.
[350:55.10]All the van AI is... How am I getting money?
[351:03.31]It's got like $25.
[351:14.05]All the van AI is fucking destroyed.
[351:16.91]They all just drive in circles.
[351:21.24]Every van now does this.
[351:30.02]Alright, fuck it.
[351:30.68]We're going this way.
[351:31.42]I'm not taking the road.
[351:33.16]I don't care.
[351:35.61]I'll lose.
[351:36.35]Oh, no.
[351:36.79]You ran over somebody's bush.
[351:38.23]Minus 500 points.
[351:38.87]Actually, it's not even that bad.
[351:51.53]Yeah, I can drive over this.
[351:52.33]I'm not grinding it.
[352:00.82]I have to get the super drone before the stream turns off.
[352:02.90]Alright, this is the field right here, right?
[352:12.94]That's the one, no?
[352:13.92]It's the one after that.
[352:14.62]I'm not doing anything.
[352:30.46]I'm actually not doing shit.
[352:35.28]Why did I only get, like, $20?
[352:36.76]Wasn't there a whole thing of wheat?
[352:37.88]99%... Oh.
[352:40.88]Ready for harvest.
[352:41.44]There was, like, 0.2% ready to eat.
[353:01.23]Alright, here we go.
[353:01.77]Let's... Do I get money for this?
[353:03.15]I hope so.
[353:14.90]This is the field, right?
[353:15.74]Just make sure I'm not messing this up.
[353:19.49]It's this one?
[353:20.11]Which one is it?
[353:20.83]Is it this one?
[353:21.83]Is it straight ahead of me?
[353:41.79]Wait, hold this up.
[353:42.71]It's this one.
[353:53.45]Plow the field.
[353:54.32]Sally, you don't have anything.
[353:55.88]You don't own shit, Sally.
[353:57.44]What do you mean, plow?
[354:00.82]Wait, like, it's this thing?
[354:01.94]Oh, this sucks.
[354:06.98]This is the only farming content that's been on the whole stream, is scraping the dirt sometimes.
[354:55.58]This is so much bigger, too.
[354:58.26]This is five times larger.
[355:07.89]How much is- what's your field?
[355:09.87]That doesn't count as your field, right?
[355:11.27]No!
[355:11.55]Don't touch it!
[355:12.20]Don't touch it!
[355:12.74]Don't touch it!
[355:13.14]Get off!
[355:13.42]Get off!
[355:13.70]Get off!
[355:13.94]Get off!
[355:18.74]That was close.
[355:33.66]No, this is not even close.
[355:35.14]It's just this... Look at how much I have to do.
[355:38.32]This is too much.
[355:40.62]I got to do it in chunks.
[355:41.52]This is what you do when you farm.
[355:59.85]So farming is not driving around looking for tomatoes and desperately trying to find a wife and flying a drone around?
[356:10.64]This is what you do?
[356:21.75]Alright, if I give up right now, can I just knock on her door and be like, uh, hey, I'm done.
[356:26.61]I don't want to do anymore.
[356:27.63]Just, can you pay me, like, 8%?
[356:31.23]Like, 4% of what I was gonna get?
[356:33.23]I don't feel like doing this.
[356:38.97]Can I just have, like, if it was gonna cost, like, 500 bucks to do this, can you just give me, like, 12 dollars?
[356:43.85]Also... Also, you wanna get married...
[356:54.35]Let's have a bunch of children, too.
[356:57.11]Also, please marry me.
[356:59.69]That was a good one.
[357:04.21]Also, marry me.
[357:09.24]You're giving us city folk a bad name.
[357:11.64]Why would anybody that lives in the city know how to do this?
[357:16.92]That's okay.
[357:20.17]Why would you expect somebody that has lived in this city their whole life to be able to know how to plow a field?
[357:40.22]Is it disappearing on me?
[357:57.60]Okay, why don't I just hire, like, 25 people to all bring their tractor.
[358:06.49]And then we all start side by side by side by side by side.
[358:12.55]All start at the same time and just drive forward once.
[358:21.30]How much more work could we get done?
[358:27.13]Instead of taking 12 hours to do this, just do it in 12 minutes, and then drive to the next one.
[358:40.52]And in one day, we could do every single field in the whole county.
[359:05.53]That's a utopian, utopian streamer.
[359:09.37]Use a giant tractor.
[359:10.45]That's another one, too.
[359:12.97]Why not just build a tractor that's just like this?
[359:15.54]Looks exactly the same, except it's 100 times larger.
[359:21.88]The seat could be the same size.
[359:25.72]It's as big as four or five houses put together.
[359:34.38]So you're just driving this huge-ass mothership across the plain and doing it in one... just drive forward once.
[359:42.06]Have you ever mowed a lawn before?
[360:03.06]Yes, and if the lawnmower was as big as my house, I could just sit it in the backyard, turn on the blades, and then turn them off, and the yard would be cut.
[360:15.50]Now, granted, that would be a catastrophic death machine.
[360:20.83]It would be immensely dangerous.
[360:33.81]But then you... Then you have a lawnmower instead of a yard.
[360:39.16]That the grass just grows up to the blades.
[360:41.38]And then you turn on the giant blades.
[360:43.05]And then turn it off.
[360:45.13]You don't even get to have a backyard.
[360:57.68]No, it would be on a mechanism that the blade was up like 60 feet, like 100 feet or something, hovering over the yard.
[361:05.89]You could play out there, you could have fun, you could hang out back there, and then you would lower it down to cut the grass.
[361:24.02]Just don't have grass.
[361:26.21]That's another one too.
[361:27.77]Just tap, like just pave your backyard.
[361:29.86]You know how much cooler shit you can have in your backyard with a paved backyard?
[361:34.63]You could have a basketball court, you could have tennis courts.
[362:05.51]Where does all the rain go?
[362:06.73]Into the drain that you have built in the middle of the backyard.
[362:08.93]A huge drain.
[362:11.79]You didn't think I thought about that?
[362:13.41]A giant drain that's connected to the sewer system.
[362:16.54]And it just... There you go.
[362:17.84]You can put a shower back there.
[362:19.02]You could have like a bunch of showers in your backyard.
[362:32.42]Draw a penis already.
[362:40.42]Alright, I'm gonna try to spell something and I'll look at it with the drone.
[362:44.38]I don't even care if I fuck up somebody's lawn.
[362:46.23]I'll be done with this game in like 20 minutes anyways.
[363:14.39]Why does it have to be this slow?
[363:17.56]Why can't you attach this to a go-kart?
[363:19.51]Those things go for 20.
[363:45.21]out here I'm like very tired and very hungry and it's like two o'clock in the morning okay I guess we're gonna just keep doing it
[364:24.08]I can't quit before I have children.
[364:25.50]Alright, but... You know how long I'm probably gonna have to play this game before I'm allowed to have children?
[364:38.09]I know I wanted to go into a coma for 20 years.
[364:42.92]But I gotta get- I have to get married.
[364:47.56]Just don't fuck around with drones.
[364:59.57]This is a mess.
[365:17.55]I can't even see what I've done.
[365:20.39]It's bad.
[365:22.01]It's really bad.
[365:25.85]I don't have that.
[365:26.41]I'm just going to stick with what I was doing before.
[365:28.27]I'm not even close.
[365:30.29]Has it been 24 hours?
[365:37.75]The sun's about to come up.
[365:45.58]Look at how bad this job is.
[365:46.90]How overtired is this guy?
[365:51.65]He's so sleep deprived.
[365:52.75]He's just fucking the whole thing up.
[366:06.46]Imagine trying to sleep to this shit you would not be able to sleep It's like this for 12 hours outside from 5 p.m.
[366:29.05]Forward
[366:35.81]Who the hell am I kidding?
[366:38.20]I guarantee you, with complete certainty, that there is a relaxing sleep sounds music video on YouTube that is tractor sounds.
[366:50.81]Guaranteed.
[367:11.60]Of course it is.
[367:14.78]Let's play a game.
[367:17.14]Well, I finished this.
[367:20.54]Name a thing that makes noise.
[367:23.36]And is it a YouTube video that's four hours long of sound effects for you to sleep to?
[367:33.64]Fish.
[367:34.54]Yep.
[367:35.76]Fish.
[367:38.66]Is it going to be inside of an aquarium?
[367:41.98]Industrial brick laying.
[367:44.21]I guarantee you type in brick laying sleep video.
[367:51.93]Farting.
[367:53.70]Guaranteed.
[367:54.74]It's going to be like sleep to farting.
[367:56.20]I swear to God, it has to be.
[368:03.37]You guys know that rule 34, if it exists, there's porn for it, right?
[368:10.20]Make a new rule.
[368:11.00]If it exists, there's a sleep soundtrack for it.
[368:35.39]sleep soundtrack.
[368:45.18]In fact, there's probably more sleep sound effects soundtrack.
[368:50.38]You're very tired.
[368:51.40]Your arms are sore.
[368:56.20]I'm in physical pain.
[369:01.08]I'm almost done.
[369:05.53]I'm sitting down.
[369:11.09]Ah, my arms are killing me.
[369:13.65]All this sitting and doing the equivalent of holding a book.
[369:19.05]I did it!

[376:49.89]Take my reward.
[376:50.79]And then... Okay, here we are.
[376:57.90]I'm back.
[376:59.82]Social points.
[377:01.52]I got it.
[377:01.83]And I got $600.
[377:02.39]That was a waste of time.
[377:05.37]You're a real charmer, aren't you?
[377:30.12]How do you give a gift to somebody?
[377:31.18]Go to the tomato girl.
[378:19.24]Alright, I'm gonna try to go to the tomato girl's house.
[378:24.61]Or let me open my rusted ass door.
[378:33.82]Yes, the green smiley face.
[378:35.46]You will not be able to gift anything to the lady yet.
[378:37.76]There's another state where the smiley has red hearts for the eyes.
[378:41.31]At this stage, you can start trading with the ladies.
[378:43.47]There is also another state where the lady has a red heart above her head.
[378:46.11]That was the state that was given the option to ask you to marry me.
[378:48.15]Okay, so... How do we get to that stage with his red eyes?
[378:55.42]How do we get a lady to have red eyes?
[379:14.79]Am I in the right place?
[379:20.47]Oh!
[379:21.15]No!
[379:21.33]Where is it?
[379:22.25]I forget every fucking time.
[379:49.13]Is it this one here?
[379:49.85]You have to trade her the ring?
[379:56.55]I did that before, and it was a disaster.
[380:01.22]Isn't this one down here?
[380:03.52]Let's just take a look.
[380:20.41]It's not this one either.
[380:24.05]Where's tomato house?
[380:31.22]Where's the tomato house?
[380:32.98]I don't know.
[380:33.54]I don't remember.
[380:34.60]I don't have any idea.
[380:36.08]What did I just do?
[380:37.58]I'm looking.
[380:44.96]I made it.
[380:59.18]Alright.
[381:00.63]Tomato.
[381:02.43]Where's the tomato family?
[381:04.19]That's tomato Frank.
[381:06.19]Where's tomato, uh, Sally?
[381:16.24]This place looks different.
[381:20.74]This is not even the right... Did new people move in?
[381:33.12]Oh, it's this one over here.
[381:40.07]Do you know what I could go for right now?
[381:44.41]Like an insanely greasy large cheese pizza.
[381:50.38]Do you know that one I'm talking about?
[381:52.64]Where you pull a slice off and you lift it up and it just falls down.
[381:57.16]And it's so weighed heavy down by the oil and the grease.
[382:00.06]It's like everything comes off of it.
[382:01.34]You have to eat it with a fork and knife.
[382:05.50]I don't even like that kind of pizza, but that's what I want right now.
[382:23.77]Anybody home?
[382:33.20]Janet.

[400:47.46]Somebody said that you're still your tired meter was low, and I was like, no fucking way.
[400:54.25]It's the food meter.
[401:03.63]Okay, I need to fucking relax.
[401:07.87]I had to sleep for six months, waking up and being like, God damn, I'm exhausted.
[401:13.29]I think I should do that again.
[401:14.49]Alright, it's been like five months.
[401:30.69]I think it's time to eat a couple of apples.
[401:39.45]Oh, that fucking did it to me.
[401:41.07]It did.
[401:44.57]Uh-oh.
[401:45.15]It's starting to take longer.
[401:48.91]I started, like, fucking, like, crying.
[401:52.05]It was just, like, instantly.
[401:55.22]Oh my god.
[401:56.06]I'm... I thought it was true.
[402:02.04]I was like, no way would I be tired.
[402:10.12]It's April.
[402:10.82]What do you mean I have to pee so bad?
[402:18.83]This whole bed would be pissing shit by this point.
[402:24.49]This would be a wet bed.
[402:25.85]It would be a soggy bed.
[402:27.41]Alright, how long is it?
[402:31.67]How much?
[402:32.41]Where do we start this?
[402:38.67]What month was it when I started?
[402:39.87]It was May?
[402:46.42]Wait.
[402:47.50]Was it May?
[402:48.58]It's been 29 months?
[402:52.32]What's that sound?
[402:54.06]Are they like bulldozing my house because they don't think anyone's here?
[402:56.96]Alright.
[403:06.17]How long has it been?
[403:16.91]It's been 29 weeks.
[403:17.49]Okay, it's been 30 weeks.
[403:18.31]I should go for a run.
[403:59.72]Julie?
[404:01.70]Julie, it's me.
[404:03.63]I'm busy.
[404:04.31]Your name's Janet.
[404:04.97]I forgot your name was Janet.
[404:06.25]Janet!
[404:07.35]Hello.
[404:09.09]Hello.
[404:09.87]Nice to see you.
[404:10.49]It's good to see you again.
[404:11.55]It's been a long time.
[404:14.55]I would have arrived earlier if I knew I'd meet a beauty like you.
[404:19.53]So nice to hear that.
[404:20.95]Thanks.
[404:27.75]Hi there.
[404:28.41]Hello.
[404:31.01]Is there something I can help you with?
[404:32.57]No.
[404:35.27]Did it hurt when you were falling from the sky?
[404:37.37]That's so s- Care to- Good.
[404:42.96]You really- It is.
[404:46.38]Hi there.
[404:47.04]So ni-
[404:48.66]lady it is so nice hello there good morning you look so pretty today that's so sweet
[405:37.53]She didn't even miss you.
[405:54.40]I'm busy.
[405:58.60]I think somebody's like cleaning my house.
[406:30.00]I don't- This is bullshit and I'll tell you why.
[406:32.20]I don't think anybody's played this game for more than 20 weeks.
[406:39.57]We're seeing this- There's no way!
[406:48.83]No one has skipped this far ahead.
[406:50.19]The game came out today!
[407:09.20]The guide.
[407:09.82]Wait, there's a guide?
[407:16.71]What's this guide for?
[407:20.49]How to get a wife.
[407:21.91]I have no clue about this post-it, but here it goes.
[407:25.06]helping tricks on how to get a wife make sure you have at least 50 000 social points okay the step by step was done when I was between 50 000 and 90 000 points if you're lower than 50 000 you might have to talk to the ladies more often okay talk to ladies everywhere on the map I talked to most of them got 50 social points per conversation complimenting them you can right click to skip the dialog you don't have to listen to the whole conversation
[407:49.47]I talk to the women about once every two days to make sure the timer actually resets.
[407:54.84]Well, I've been sleeping months and weeks.
[407:59.76]Since one game hour is about five minutes, that means 12 hours in game you can talk to the ladies.
[408:05.03]Wait, what?
[408:09.77]You can only compliment them once per real hour.
[408:16.20]Since one game hour is five minutes, it means twelve hours in-game to talk to them.
[408:44.17]But I'm sleeping for months!
[408:47.17]I'm sleeping for months.
[409:04.24]The clock on the PC.
[409:06.92]Put your computer clock forward.
[409:09.12]Will that work?
[409:10.83]Hold on, if I make my computer clock an hour ahead, will it work?
[409:19.44]Okay, let's try that.
[409:22.66]Okay, save game.
[409:25.04]Save game.
[409:27.64]It's not gonna work.
[409:29.65]Why would it work?
[409:31.33]Guys, why would that work?
[409:32.09]This is not like a... This is not a DS.
[409:44.56]Just try it.
[409:49.56]Okay.
[409:50.38]It's... I'm making it... I'm making it... I'm going to make it 9... I'm going to make it 10 o'clock.
[409:58.96]What you're already doing is going to work.
[410:06.38]Adjust date and time.
[410:13.32]Okay.
[410:14.18]Set time to...
[410:21.08]Change date and time.
[410:22.14]Let's make it like, I don't know, like 10 p.m., 1041 p.m.
[410:44.85]I have to come back.
[410:45.55]I have to come back.
[410:46.87]I don't know why that fucked up the stream.
[410:51.25]I think the time synchronization there, I guess it's like the Twitch doesn't like that.
[410:59.24]So I'm not going to do that.
[411:10.05]You literally traveled through time.
[411:12.63]Okay, I can't do that.
[411:13.99]Because the streaming software into Twitch does not like that I'm pretending it's 10.40pm for some reason.
[411:22.28]It's counting how many minutes you actually play.
[411:27.50]Oh, great.
[412:04.08]No, I'm not going to get a trainer.
[412:08.06]You are not going to watch me download a trainer and put it on this engine on stream.
[412:15.63]And plus, the trainer doesn't even do anything.
[412:17.39]The trainer gives you super speed and unlimited money.
[412:21.55]I can't change the time.
[412:22.71]I can't change the time.
[412:25.59]You cannot change the time.
[412:33.85]The stuff I was doing should work.
[412:35.19]It doesn't care how long I'm playing.
[412:36.72]Alright, well, hold on.
[412:40.46]What if we do this?
[412:43.48]Is there a way I can see a watch?
[412:44.72]What if I just stand there for... Okay, I was gonna have a podcast.
[413:01.92]It's six o'clock right now.
[413:03.96]I'm just gonna stand here until 8.
[413:04.92]Wow, I mean, but holy shit, in, like, in 7 months?
[413:11.50]You've got a great garden now.
[413:14.30]Okay, and what time is it?
[413:15.49]6.
[413:15.51]2 hours.
[413:43.89]Oh, does it take five minutes?
[413:56.22]What happened?
[414:51.93]Count to 300 out loud to pass the time.
[414:56.91]Fly to the source of the 5G.
[414:58.68]That's where I'm going.
[415:16.55]It didn't work.
[415:23.44]Has...
[415:38.18]Racing drone time?
[415:39.14]I think it's time to sell everything and then just get the cool drone and like, who cares?
[415:44.06]Who needs a wife when you can have a super drone and fly around?
[415:48.20]I don't need a wife and kids.
[415:49.92]I don't need all white picket friends.
[415:52.24]I don't need that shit in my life.
[415:54.18]I got me and my $10,000 super drone.
[415:58.13]That's all I need.
[416:07.38]But I am going to try one more time.
[416:16.87]I just need my $10,000 super drone.
[416:22.09]Why does it say that I've played this game for 13 hours?
[416:32.56]You've played for 13 hours.
[416:33.98]No, I haven't.
[416:45.39]the time going yeah but I only went forward two hours the stream's been live for about seven hours I started playing this game for that when that started why would it add six more hours on top of this I did not play this at all before the stream absolutely not
[417:09.21]13 hours playtime, how?
[417:11.63]I mean, okay, skipping forward was two hours, so nine hours.
[417:17.20]Where's the other four hours from?
[417:20.04]You went forward two and then backwards two, that comes out to four.
[417:29.02]That's not how that, wait, it counts reversing time?
[417:35.96]Almost, we're getting there, one more, another hour.
[418:20.76]Scaffoldings.
[418:22.52]Pog.
[418:47.18]Have I passed enough time yet?
[419:06.98]It's only been three minutes.
[419:19.42]Are these being deleted?
[419:20.18]Alright.
[419:35.73]Let's try now.
[419:36.21]12 in-game hours.
[419:36.53]But is that... Alright.
[419:45.34]Am I...
[420:04.63]No, I'm out.
[420:05.17]I'm just gonna make- I'm just gonna get the cool drone.
[420:07.05]I'm done.
[420:13.60]I'm selling everything.
[420:27.98]How did you even manage to do that?
[420:32.58]Hey, I'm back.
[420:35.28]Good to see you.
[420:36.14]Can I help you?
[420:37.36]Yes, I'd like to trade with you.
[420:38.76]Sure.
[420:39.80]And I would like to give you everything.
[420:44.88]I want enough to buy the cool drone.
[420:46.98]I don't care.
[420:47.84]Get rid of it all.
[420:58.60]Don't even need a rake.
[421:02.81]Fishing line cares.
[421:05.99]I don't need these anymore.
[421:15.96]Super drum.
[421:21.71]Man, give me some of those fucking tomatoes back.
[421:23.13]You don't deserve them all.
[421:23.89]I need to eat stuff.
[421:40.28]Who needs a family when I got this?
[421:50.77]So much better than a wife.
[421:54.25]I don't need a wife.
[421:55.07]I don't need, ooh, ooh.
[422:23.31]I'm going to do a drone race.
[422:28.16]Just taking the bus.
[422:28.84]Alright.
[422:37.20]I was trying to drag the map, and I'm taking an extra bus now.
[422:40.99]Great.
[422:46.33]Where is it?
[422:46.77]Up here?
[422:49.21]Where is it?
[422:53.91]Drone race time.
[422:54.75]There it is.
[422:55.09]Okay, let's go on this.
[422:55.89]It's that one.
[422:59.71]I'm going to destroy the competition right now.
[423:25.81]And, uh, by the way, this is the end of the stream.
[423:44.26]You're gonna make it?
[423:45.58]No, you are lined up in a per- No!
[423:48.96]How did you do that?
[423:56.87]It's actually harder to control this one because it's not first person.
[424:14.67]Alright, let's go!
[424:15.48]Drones!
[424:17.74]What are we doing?
[424:18.16]Drone battle?
[424:25.72]Where's the drone battle?
[424:32.61]This is the drone competition?
[424:33.93]Manure spreader.
[424:34.63]Aww.
[425:01.67]Where's the drone competition?
[425:06.55]I walked into more work.
[425:28.61]Who will challenge me?
[425:31.00]Who will challenge me?
[425:32.26]No one, it seems.
[425:37.48]Oh, I have to wait a day.
[425:39.14]I slept a goddamn year.
[425:47.88]And now I have to wait a day.
[425:50.73]Well, wait a minute.
[426:18.39]I didn't even buy an animal.
[426:19.78]I didn't do anything.
[426:58.12]I'm busy.
[427:06.82]Hello there.
[427:07.68]Good morning.
[427:10.08]You look so pretty today.
[427:11.83]It is so nice to hear.
[427:17.99]Hello.
[427:18.51]Good mo- You look- It is so- Care to talk?
[427:24.60]Good mo- Is there snow?
[427:29.26]Oh, fuck it.
[427:29.64]Goodbye.
[427:34.64]Bus station.
[427:35.40]Let's go to the bus stop.
[427:36.64]Let's go to the drone competition.
[427:39.48]Where's my truck?
[427:57.56]Bus stop.
[428:05.49]I mean, yeah.
[428:07.55]Life is a little hard right now.
[428:09.70]But imagine being that guy.
[428:14.00]All he can do is drive around in a circle.
[428:30.11]This is it.
[428:32.51]I get to show my...
[428:36.79]What happened?
[428:41.57]Here we go.
[428:42.81]Come join the local sports event drone race.
[428:46.97]Let's do it.
[428:48.01]I'm ready.
[428:50.29]I'm going to accomplish something in the game.
[429:07.03]I'm gonna laugh my ass off if I win the drone competition and there's like a girl there that's flying drones too and is impressed by my drone flying and then I can marry her.
[429:26.24]I got the fastest drone in the world.
[429:28.24]What do we take out our drones?
[429:36.60]This is what you are up against.
[429:37.95]This right here is what you are gonna have to go against.
[429:41.79]Wait, Superman 64?
[430:06.10]Come on, I gotta impress somebody.
[430:30.05]Slow down, it's gonna be too fast.
[430:32.60]Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up!
[430:34.72]Alright, easy, easy!
[430:44.78]I won the race.
[430:49.00]I won.
[430:49.98]I got $100 and twice the social coins.
[430:55.48]Who cares?
[430:55.98]Hello there.
[431:08.15]You really look beautiful today.
[431:11.43]So nice to hear that.
[431:18.53]Wow, I did it.
[431:19.27]I won the drone competition.
[431:20.91]I'm the drone master.
[431:29.08]Whatever, fuck all of you.
[431:38.07]Hello.
[431:38.81]Well, hello.
[431:39.49]Alright, this would be like the second quest I've done.
[431:46.29]Care to talk?
[431:46.89]Hello.
[431:49.45]Is there- I need one of my fields called- Would you do it?
[431:55.48]Sounds good.
[431:56.30]I'll take care of it.
[432:04.20]So huge.
[432:05.22]That is the biggest field.
[432:11.06]Well, nice work on that drone race.
[432:13.01]You really just did so good.
[432:18.23]Please cultivate my field for me.
[432:22.90]We'll talk later.
[432:27.88]It's sad.
[432:30.14]I'm running faster than this car.
[432:33.92]Oh!
[432:37.60]You know what?
[432:46.21]This is what I'm good at.
[432:48.15]Do what you're good at.
[432:53.96]Oh, no.
[432:54.34]You know what?
[433:03.96]You know what?
[433:04.42]I have a better idea.
[433:51.22]Oh, this is sad.
[433:51.94]This is the culmination of the last full year of this guy's life.
[434:25.42]I had to call a tow truck.
[434:36.61]I can't even destroy their crops anymore.
[434:58.59]Fine, I'm just gonna go away.
[435:06.74]I'll make my own world down here.
[435:09.60]In player solitude.
[435:28.17]I'm gonna go live on the beach.
[435:39.12]Wait, how is this player solitude when somebody lives here?
[436:57.91]This is the first spot that I came to.
[437:02.46]I actually got off on this beach.
[437:11.88]I rode up.
[437:17.63]Thought I could just throw myself into the world of farming like people do Hollywood.
[437:27.05]A lot harder than that.
[437:35.49]I thought it could have been easy.
[437:40.15]This is the spot.
[437:49.28]Slept a lot.
[437:53.64]But, you know, I was tired.
[438:05.15]Four years ago when I arrived here, the boat was parked on this beach.
[438:14.27]It looks like somebody stole that from me.
[438:18.58]It looks like there's an invisible wall that you can't cross.
[438:25.76]You know, just like in life, how many invisible walls do we have set up for ourselves?
[438:33.56]The world is teaching me something right now.
[438:35.73]I'm being shown something very important.
[438:51.22]And I need to try this with the truck.
[439:23.75]It's time to break down those barriers.
[439:49.35]Social points Some how many likes you can get on Twitter how many that doesn't matter to me and once it doesn't matter it stops as you see Every mountain is hard to climb
[440:16.10]It's about getting over those mountains.
[440:26.07]If the water seems too deep, call on a friend.
[440:29.39]Uh-oh.
[440:30.65]No friends.
[440:49.47]Oh no.
[440:55.81]Hold on.
[440:57.19]When... Friends come in all shapes and sizes.
[441:15.29]It broke it.
[441:15.79]I broke the drone.
[441:16.77]And my other friend's dead.
[441:21.30]I have to run to a gas station now.
[441:34.10]Damn it!
[441:41.63]And sometimes a stranger
[441:44.49]The kindness of a stranger is all it takes.
[441:48.27]But our furry companions are the true friends
[442:24.12]What a boring fucking animal.
[442:30.93]Stop!
[442:34.99]Um... I need to get that... I need to get... I need to...
[443:08.02]I need to sell something.
[443:09.20]I need to sell something.
[443:11.42]Does anybody here sell?
[443:17.74]Do you sell anything?
[443:18.77]I need to trade.
[443:22.41]Oh my god.
[443:29.11]Okay, there's a coffee shop over here.
[443:36.63]Is there a store in town?
[443:38.21]No.
[443:40.37]I have nothing to sell?
[443:41.99]Are you sure about that?
[443:47.80]Sometimes our material things need to be let go.
[443:52.78]Oh, will you fucking just get an AI oil change for God's sake?
[444:04.03]I have 17 tomatoes and a $10,000 drone.
[444:06.73]I don't need the drone anymore.
[444:10.14]Same fucking ice cream truck.
[444:36.60]Stream snipers, they're coming for me.
[444:38.72]Get em!
[444:39.12]Hi!
[444:39.44]That's not enough, I need two.
[445:04.57]Walking into a Starbucks and asking the barista behind the counter if they'd like to buy a $4,500 drum.
[445:10.95]I think you're going to probably want to sleep on that one.
[445:19.84]Alright, tow truck.
[445:21.62]Where's my truck?
[445:28.48]And sometimes you get a call on a friend
[445:33.36]pull you up.
[445:47.53]No mountain is too high.
[446:04.11]But that spot, that one spot.
[446:25.68]But that one little spot.
[447:04.82]I don't know I'm trying to get
[447:08.80]I'm trying to add sounds to the game because there are no sounds!
[447:12.49]That spot.
[447:15.51]That my grandfather brought me to.
[447:18.49]All those years ago.
[447:27.50]It's one of my favorite... One of my favorite things when I used to be a kid.
[447:50.89]And sometimes you gotta call on a friend.
[447:55.71]More than once.
[448:03.98]Where's the beach?!
[448:05.28]Where's the beach?! !
[448:23.31]Guys, this video, they're dropping cars out of the sky!
[448:27.47]Why are they doing this?
[448:33.57]They're dropping car- the cars are coming from the sky in frame.
[448:37.41]It doesn't make any sense.
[448:38.25]Alright, can I get in here now?
[448:56.82]Holy shit it broke Okay, I made it
[449:38.78]I've had this old truck since I was 17 when I first got my permit.
[449:46.91]Me and my grandfather drove this over in our boat.
[449:50.05]It was a long paddle.
[450:39.90]And sometimes you call on a friend.
[451:35.96]Sometimes you have to try to glitch into the wall, like you do on the houses.
[452:20.49]Sometimes you need to call in a friend.
[452:38.88]Not this time.
[452:40.18]This time we do it on our own.
[453:00.00]Push.
[453:04.98]Sometimes you gotta give up.
[453:08.72]Sometimes you gotta give up.
[453:17.44]Sometimes you want to go get a large greasy ass pizza, so you don't want to do this anymore.
[453:41.47]So,
[454:09.27]I'm going to bed.
[454:09.83]I'm out.
[454:10.29]I'm done.
[454:21.27]Sometimes you gotta go to bed.
[454:24.67]Although, interesting.
[454:27.15]Sometimes you have to stick around.
[454:29.39]Because there's an invisible wall next to me and an invisible wall in front of me.
[454:33.99]We're not leaving yet.
[454:36.35]I can't leave.
[454:37.18]I can only go this way.
[454:40.63]I think I did get out into the invisible wall.
[454:43.95]Because this is blocked and this is blocked.
[454:45.22]Let's see what happens.
[454:49.62]I'm going over this waterfall.
[454:53.08]Can I?
[454:57.26]I wonder what happens here.
[454:59.18]Can I actually make it over?
[455:06.95]Is it moving?
[455:07.53]I can't tell if it's getting closer or not.
[455:15.96]No, I found the true end.
[455:20.32]This is the true end.
[455:20.96]Yep.
[455:22.56]That's it.
[455:30.20]We're just stuck in the water forever.
[455:35.30]But sometimes...
[455:48.99]Alright, see you guys tomorrow.
[455:50.55]We're gonna play Sniper Contracts tomorrow.
[455:59.55]Uh, who knows if it's gonna be any good.
[456:02.36]It could be terrible, but... I'm willing to give it a try.
[456:07.58]Oh no.
[456:11.76]Everything is broken.
[456:12.88]Can I even change scenes in OBS?
[456:17.55]From the time traveling thing, when I went forward two hours, it just fucked everything up.
[456:23.48]I think I can do it manually through here, let me see.
[456:33.95]Can I?
[456:38.71]I can, alright, cool.
[456:39.61]I don't think I can play the music though, this is like broken.
[456:47.63]Let me try.
[456:48.23]Have to reopen this.
[456:56.12]Thanks for watching, though, guys.
[456:57.46]That was Farming Destiny.
[456:59.14]Or whatever the damn thing is called.
[457:03.46]Farming, whatever it's called.
[457:05.02]Farming Simulator.
[457:07.14]What's it called?
[457:07.62]Farming Dynasty.
[457:21.52]Let's see.
[457:22.06]Can I... Yes, I can.
[457:28.48]I can't even open a media file on my computer.
[457:33.66]We're going musicless.
[457:36.24]Apparently.
[457:39.51]Why did that happen?
[457:41.05]Why does that matter?
[457:41.85]Hold on.
[457:44.33]I'm going to just force quit it.
[457:50.33]I'm still alive, right?
[457:59.30]Okay, let's try this.
[458:00.82]There we go.
[458:01.48]Alright.
[458:03.56]Good.
[458:05.41]Although I can't see how loud this is.
[458:07.41]Because my actual OBS is completely broken.
[458:12.87]I have no idea if this is too loud or I can't even tell.
[458:17.19]Am I fixing it?
[458:17.93]Because I don't have an indicator.
[458:23.46]How's that?
[458:27.67]Now it's too quiet.
[458:29.17]Alright, how's that?
[458:29.63]Alright, let's do the bits.
[458:34.71]Let's go over them from earlier.
[458:36.77]Thanks for watching again, everybody.
[458:37.76]See you tomorrow, probably, for Sniper Contracts.
[458:42.36]Let's teleport back to... That was fun.
[458:45.96]I didn't do a goddamn thing, but that was a lot of fun.
[458:56.58]Let's go back.
[458:56.96]Thank you to Noneja.
[459:00.06]Noneja AR.
[459:01.52]Thank you for the 300 bits.
[459:03.26]Hey Jerm, thanks for the Vegas advice.
[459:06.12]Since Danganronpa doesn't seem to be up your alley, can I recommend Force Unleashed?
[459:11.72]It'd be a lot of fun to watch you throw Wookiees off bridges.
[459:14.49]Oh, and to answer your question, I'm 24.
[459:15.43]Alright.
[459:15.67]Um...
[459:22.49]Force Unleashed?
[459:23.37]Should I play the Force Unleashed?
[459:24.75]There's so many games that I have not played.
[459:30.19]Force Unleashed is really good.
[459:31.33]There's two of them, aren't there?
[459:40.65]Two is alright.
[459:41.49]Two is eh.
[459:42.93]Second one kind of sucks.
[459:44.63]Okay.
[459:48.09]Put it on the list.
[459:50.73]Guys, I still have to play through all the Halo games.
[459:53.88]So that's going to be a while.
[460:02.06]Should be a lot of fun though.
[460:03.00]And Half-Life 1.
[460:10.12]No, I'm not playing through.
[460:11.04]I've already played through Half-Life 1 a bunch of times.
[460:15.44]Hey, Martin had a meme thanks to a thousand bits.
[460:18.14]I say romance, dialog options, and experience points.
[460:20.84]Is this grass effect?
[460:28.39]Hey, BlueDKRF, thanks for the 500 bits.
[460:30.75]Never make that noise again.
[460:32.55]I make a lot of noises on these streams, so I'm sorry.
[460:35.81]I don't know which one you're referring to.
[460:38.21]It was seven and a half hours ago, whatever it was.
[460:44.74]It was the really bad one.
[460:45.89]Oh, okay.
[460:46.35]Well, that narrows it down for me.
[460:48.63]Thank you Gnarly for the $2.50.
[460:49.89]Here's another addition to the Jeremy was in my dream journal.
[460:53.59]Okay.
[460:53.87]Your stream starting in an hour.
[460:56.53]So I launched a Steam game that was a Souls-like set in Fallout New Vegas.
[461:01.42]I got a Steam alert that you just launched it too.
[461:04.68]I asked if you wanted to play with me and you agreed.
[461:06.74]We played for like three hours.
[461:08.86]Chat was fuming when you were two whole hours late to the stream.
[461:12.64]We should play again sometime.
[461:13.98]Hit me up.
[461:20.75]Dark soulslike in New Vegas.
[461:28.03]Hit me up.
[461:40.08]That sounds like an interesting dream.
[461:42.84]That sounds like a fun game, too.
[461:46.72]Thanks for the 250, though.
[461:47.68]Seriously.
[461:48.00]Thank you, Raddest Raccoon, for the 250.
[461:51.10]Jeremy, play Chrono Trigger on Steam.
[461:53.22]On stream for me, please.
[461:58.55]Uh... I might do a... Remember when I played Mario RPG?
[462:03.23]And we just did the whole thing?
[462:06.68]That'd be another one of those scenarios where I just play Chrono Trigger on stream.
[462:11.41]would not be experiencing anything new it would just be me showing you how much I like this video game that's kind of like with Mario RPG I'm just showing you how much I liked this video game it's pretty long too yeah it is it is pretty long you're right I don't know I did it once maybe I'll do it again but thank you radis raccoon thanks to the 250.
[462:43.19]Uh, Friliddy, we missed some subs.
[462:45.25]I missed 10 community subs from Friliddy.
[462:48.02]Thanks a lot, Friliddy, for your 10 sub drop.
[462:52.06]Appreciate it.
[462:55.76]Thank you.
[463:00.30]Uh, Pretendir, thanks for the $2.50.
[463:01.56]Today is yet another example of why we need Jerma's Psycho.
[463:07.75]Yeah.
[463:09.66]It'll be there eventually.
[463:10.48]I tell you, there's gonna be a stream dedicated to just meme- just making emotes.
[463:21.23]Hey SadVega, thanks for the 250.
[463:22.71]This game is unbearably fucking bad.
[463:25.63]Why am I laughing so hard at something so awful?
[463:28.57]You spent two hours trying to get $95 by growing tomatoes over the course of a month.
[463:33.60]And you did about $4,000 worth of damage to your vehicle in the process.
[463:44.10]I didn't do any farming.
[463:46.00]No, I did farming for other people.
[463:49.22]Right?
[463:50.96]Yeah, I did work for other people.
[463:52.90]I just dragged a thing on somebody's lawn.
[463:58.06]I did plant tomatoes, though, and they were succulent.
[464:04.97]It was a fun game, though.
[464:09.12]Vanilla Grime, thanks for the $4.89.
[464:12.80]Please help, I can't, I still can't stop using the bathroom.
[464:16.77]Well, uh, I would go to a doctor.
[464:21.11]Have a doctor come see you.
[464:25.05]Thank you, Jade Sphere, for the thousand bits.
[464:27.49]This is my first time ever purchasing bits, but I was choking on my tears.
[464:31.70]And I had to find a way to give you some money.
[464:38.98]Well, thank you.
[464:39.54]I appreciate it.
[464:40.90]It was a lot of fun.
[464:43.40]I had a good time.
[464:45.26]I actually did laugh pretty damn hard.
[464:49.02]Tears were welling up in my eyes.
[464:50.18]That was fucking funny as hell.
[464:59.15]Hey, Stinky Beaver, thanks for the $2.50 turn-on cam.
[465:01.91]Doesn't work.
[465:02.69]I have a turn-on webcam blocker when I'm not wearing clothes, which I am not wearing any right now, so it's not on.
[465:11.18]Thank you, Produce... Sasan, for the five community subs.
[465:18.20]Thanks a lot, Produce.
[465:20.14]Or Produces.
[465:21.26]Thank you.
[465:23.78]And speaking of subs, hey.
[465:26.49]Why don't we just move over here?
[465:31.39]Take a walk with me.
[465:32.41]Take a walk with me.
[465:33.73]Why don't we just drop my monitor?
[465:36.60]Holy shit, that would have been bad.
[465:38.02]You're probably asking, what the hell is he talking about?
[465:40.43]I cannot explain what I mean.
[465:42.99]It's not possible for me to tell you what I'm talking about.
[465:45.77]My monitor almost fell backwards.
[465:47.37]Just... Just trust me on that one.
[465:51.01]Thank you for all the subs.
[465:54.45]Welcome all the new subs, all the community subs.
[465:57.51]Everybody that sticks with this channel.
[466:02.05]Really appreciate it.
[466:09.13]Thanks for letting me do what I'm doing.
[466:12.67]Because without you, there is no me.
[466:17.25]So thanks.
[466:26.27]And don't you forget it!
[466:27.83]That guy's not even subbed.
[466:49.24]Ban him?
[466:49.82]No.
[466:50.99]You can express his opinion.
[466:57.13]And I can express a fart out of my ass.
[467:13.26]Anyways, no, thank you.
[467:14.48]Seriously, I'm just kidding around.
[467:17.09]Thank you Labit, or Labet, for the 400 bits.
[467:19.74]This was one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time.
[467:21.68]Thank you.
[467:22.14]You're welcome.
[467:23.40]Thank you for watching.
[467:24.48]Thank you for experiencing with me.
[467:29.12]I thought it was a fun game.
[467:32.66]I just didn't know that you had to actually spend, like, 12 hours in-game to do anything.
[467:38.73]was it was enjoyable a game doesn't have to be like a 9 out of 10 on ign to be an enjoyable experience you make your own fun sometimes that's more fun than when you don't there's a good amount of water in here yeah he was about to say good
[468:07.53]It has something for everyone.
[468:12.81]Farming Simulator doesn't have drone car flipping.
[468:17.03]If you want drone car flipping in your game... Why is there a drone in this game?
[468:27.84]There's no camera on that drone.
[468:29.36]You don't take pictures with it.
[468:33.74]Why is it in the game?
[468:35.28]Just because?
[468:41.64]That's just cool.
[468:43.12]There's no farming reason for farmers to use drones?
[468:45.94]Maybe they do.
[468:49.48]Red Walrus, thanks for the 346.
[468:50.48]Hey Tomato, pretty big fan of your YouTube content.
[468:55.58]Really happy that you're streaming now.
[468:57.24]Have you considered playing any of the TimeSplitters games on stream?
[469:00.28]They'd be pretty cool to watch if you played with Kryken.
[469:04.00]What are you talking about?
[469:06.14]You're on the wrong stream.
[469:07.68]Haha, funny joke, but seriously.
[469:09.46]Oh, Dermboy, it'd be entertaining to see if you played... Oh, okay, alright.
[469:20.10]Oh, tomato.
[469:21.02]I was saying tomato a bunch of times.
[469:22.86]There were a lot of tomatoes in this stream.
[469:27.44]Also, win back for the PS2 would be a great stream.
[469:31.48]Pretty much the most influential third-person shooter ever.
[469:37.08]yeah uh I don't Joel came in here and was talking about doing doing a co-op thing so is Joel streaming right now I gotta hit him up on Discord we were that way it was just like let's play a game and I was like alright what do you wanna play tribes and he was like yeah then I was like yeah and he was like alright let's go
[470:03.90]Then I went to sleep.
[470:05.70]And it's been like a week or two.
[470:07.75]I slept for two weeks.
[470:10.19]Where are you, Joel?
[470:19.93]He's not on the same spot.
[470:22.08]Shit.
[470:23.92]What do you mean, where is he?
[470:26.23]Where are you?
[470:27.29]Where is he?
[470:27.71]Where is he?
[470:28.51]What do you mean, where am I?
[470:30.83]I'm here.
[470:31.23]I'm right here.
[470:31.87]Where is he?
[470:32.33]He's not right... Is he here right now?
[470:34.18]Where is he?
[470:35.26]He's not here?
[470:46.74]He's trying to sleep for months to impress a girl.
[470:52.43]No, we haven't even talked to each other about it.
[470:55.75]But that's a good... You know what?
[470:56.65]After this stream ends, I'm going to send a message.
[470:57.81]I'm going to say, hey, when are we going to play Halo Master Chief Edition?
[471:06.71]Whatever we're going to do.
[471:07.76]We'll do something.
[471:09.06]Me and Joel have been trying to play a game together for like almost two years.
[471:13.48]It just had never happened.
[471:15.56]Hey, what do you want to do this?
[471:16.78]I'm kind of busy doing this.
[471:17.62]Oh, I'm busy doing this.
[471:18.70]I'm doing this.
[471:19.34]I'm not going to be.
[471:19.80]I'm going to be gone for like two weeks.
[471:21.00]I'm going to be gone for a week.
[471:22.28]We've been trying to play a video game for like a year and a half.
[471:33.87]Sell him your drone.
[471:39.95]He got busy and then I got busy and then he got busy and then I got busy.
[471:47.04]How do you hang out with friends these days?
[471:49.56]It's impossible.
[471:59.33]No, we'll play something.
[472:00.21]It'll be fun.
[472:01.43]It's been on the docket for like a year.
[472:05.31]So I'll let him up tonight.
[472:07.23]See what he's doing.
[472:14.20]You had over 4,000 people watching you try to stack cars when you didn't say a word for five minutes.
[472:19.46]It's crazy.
[472:26.14]But I failed.
[472:27.02]I didn't do it.
[472:29.26]That was the worst part.
[472:30.40]I was trying, and I failed.
[472:38.56]I think I've mentioned this a bunch of times before, but...
[472:44.41]If this was YouTube.com slash Jerma985 from 2013, 2014, I would have sat there every day until I got that car on that roof, even if it took 20 straight hours.
[473:03.52]And it would have been one clip in the video.
[473:14.28]That would have been a total of about 8 seconds, or 9 seconds of time in the video.
[473:21.24]But when you're on broadcast, when you're on stream, you gotta move on sometimes.
[473:26.47]You can't keep trying to get the one thing you want.
[473:30.17]I'm willing to give it a shot.
[473:38.75]So what you're saying is you don't care that much anymore.
[473:40.95]No, what I'm saying is if I turned on my stream tomorrow and started moving a car with a drone with the same game, and that's what the stream was for seven straight hours.
[473:52.96]And then I did that again the next day.
[473:55.48]I think people would be like, I don't wanna watch you do this.
[474:00.91]At all.
[474:01.85]I don't wanna see this.
[474:04.21]And this is the- you stream like three, sometimes four times a week.
[474:07.65]This is what we're getting for the whole week.
[474:09.54]And then you're gonna take like a few days off.
[474:12.36]Okay.
[474:13.42]Well that was- that was a cool week.
[474:15.80]Of trying to get a car and a roof.
[474:17.22]Alright.
[474:23.79]Those aren't real fans.
[474:32.47]That sounds like a good stream to me.
[474:35.99]There are almost... There are at least 2,000 insane fuckers here who would watch that.
[474:42.62]I do realize that.
[474:45.16]And those are... Hey.
[474:47.00]And those are the fucking... Those are the real ones.
[474:51.44]Yes.
[474:51.78]The 2,000 or 3,000 of those... There's 2,200 people here right now.
[474:53.71]You guys are the real ones.
[475:08.46]The real ones.
[475:12.34]No.
[475:12.94]Anybody that watches any portion of my streams, thank you for doing that.
[475:18.10]But if you're willing to watch me try to flip a car with a drone for three days, that's next level.
[475:27.85]Levers.
[475:30.11]I can't expect anybody to sit there and watch that.
[475:32.77]I'm just fucking around.
[475:35.25]But thank you for watching it.
[475:38.99]Don't worry.
[475:39.63]Fast forward to tomorrow when I try to, like, snipe the same person for probably two straight hours and I mess it up.
[475:46.73]I can already see it happening.
[475:50.40]Don't worry.
[475:51.08]I'll try to flip a car tomorrow.
[475:52.88]Okay?
[475:54.26]I will flip a car.
[475:55.26]If there's a flippable car tomorrow, I promise I will flip that car.
[476:03.75]Stream eating the deep dish pizza.
[476:07.59]Why would you say I was gonna get a deep dish pizza?
[476:09.77]I don't want... I don't want tomato paste in a pie tin.
[476:14.43]Uh oh.
[476:26.94]Did I just give an opinion on deep dish pizza?
[476:37.34]You sure did.
[476:40.94]What's the last flavor of pie you've eaten?
[476:42.84]Banana cream pie, and it is the best.
[476:45.68]It has absolutely no equal.
[476:49.20]By the way, let me give you a quick little what-the-fuck scenario.
[476:55.63]Why can't I find banana ice cream anywhere?
[477:00.67]I've tried everywhere.
[477:01.83]I want banana ice cream.
[477:07.86]not I the chunky monkey is banana ice cream with a bunch of in it I don't want that I just want banana ice cream no yeah Ben and Jerry's has chunky monkey that's just that that's banana flavored ice cream with like walnuts and almonds and chocolate syrup and just banana ice cream it's hard to make it's incredibly simple
[477:33.57]You just mash up bananas and blend it in with the ice cream.
[477:37.31]It's probably the easiest thing to possibly do.
[477:41.39]Then do it.
[477:42.03]I don't have an ice cream machine.
[477:44.37]I'm supposed to go buy an ice cream maker?
[477:47.11]And make my own banana ice cream?
[477:48.57]That's actually a pretty good idea.
[477:49.73]Nice idea.
[477:51.51]Good idea.
[477:53.19]Really good idea.
[477:53.71]I'm gonna do that.
[477:54.45]Yeah.
[477:55.17]Cool.
[477:58.30]I'm gonna get an ice cream machine and I'm gonna make banana ice cream.
[478:01.80]I'll make it better.
[478:06.29]But, um, yeah, banana cream pie is the best.
[478:11.50]Banana cream pie is better than chocolate cream pie, I think.
[478:13.98]Because chocolate cream pie is just fudge with whipped cream on it, let's be honest.
[478:23.38]It's... banana cream's way better.
[478:29.47]It's just, it's just mousse.
[478:30.55]It's just chocolate mousse with whipped cream all over it.
[478:34.05]That's not, I don't think that's as special.
[478:44.31]Stop, stop it.
[478:47.27]Don't, get out of here.
[478:51.84]Get out of my room.
[478:53.70]Get out of my room.
[478:55.32]I'm just trying, get out of my fucking room.
[478:58.38]Alright, Jesus.
[479:04.80]Some people just come in and they just talk shit to me.
[479:10.49]Would you eat Dorito ice cream?
[479:11.57]No.
[479:14.62]I don't like to put bacon on my ice cream either.
[479:16.18]People go, I'm going to put bacon on my ice cream.
[479:22.39]No, I don't.
[479:24.19]No, that's too much for me.
[479:31.53]Would you eat chocolate dough?
[479:35.10]Yes, I would eat chocolate ice cream.
[479:38.56]I love chocolate ice cream.
[479:44.26]cool rank ice cream flavors strawberry smooth without any strawberry bits or pieces in it just strawberry flavored ice cream and I know yeah oh he's a serial killer serial killer he's he's a sir he's killing he's a serial killer no not sherbert just strawberry flavored ice cream plain plain banana ice cream plain chocolate ice cream plain
[480:14.78]He's killing people and eating them.
[480:17.24]He probably eats people.
[480:18.26]I know.
[480:18.64]I know what you're saying.
[480:20.60]But I really do believe that straight up just flavored strawberry smooth ice cream is the best.
[480:37.09]No.
[480:37.33]No tier list.
[480:38.03]No.
[480:39.29]No.
[480:39.51]Maybe tomorrow.
[480:41.23]Get me some good tier lists and maybe we'll do them tomorrow.
[480:44.55]Because Sniper Contracts is going to last like 38 minutes.
[480:48.67]I'm going to play it for like an hour, and I'm going to be like, this game's stupid.
[480:51.49]And then we'll... I already bought it, so I'm not going to... This is what we're doing.
[480:57.62]I'm going in with low expectations, so if the game's actually good, then we'll play the whole thing.
[481:05.48]But...
[481:08.85]Uh, let's finish up the bits.
[481:09.63]Thank you, Stardust Flare, for the 300 bits.
[481:12.46]Thanks, Jermis.
[481:12.98]So many laughs tonight and an amazing stream.
[481:15.26]Thank you.
[481:16.68]Glad you had a good time.
[481:20.14]I did too.
[481:22.56]Plug boy, thanks for the 250.
[481:23.80]Nearing the end of Death Stranding.
[481:25.34]It's definitely my game of the year.
[481:27.22]It's not for everyone, but it's a Kojima game for sure.
[481:30.30]Not sure if you got your hands on it.
[481:32.36]I have not.
[481:34.02]I'm probably not going to play it anytime soon.
[481:38.29]Because I heard it is... It's like a 50 hour game to get to the end.
[481:44.59]Like a 40 to 60 hour game.
[481:46.31]Is that correct?
[481:47.97]I don't think I...
[481:50.82]I'm not sure I'm ready to commit like 50 plus hours to a game at the moment.
[481:58.37]Unless it was on stream.
[481:59.43]Because for the most part, when I play video games, I play them on stream.
[482:03.63]It's just kind of when I game at this point is... I do some stuff off stream.
[482:07.51]I can play God of War a little bit, but... 40 is standard.
[482:14.84]Yeah.
[482:18.62]It looks cool.
[482:20.62]That's just something I don't think I would stream.
[482:25.22]But, if it's a game of the year, that's good.
[482:29.22]Hey, better late than never, right?
[482:31.46]We are almost at the end of November.
[482:35.32]Game of the year.
[482:38.58]But they say, also, that new Star Wars game I'm hearing is very Sekiro-like.
[482:45.07]You should check it out.
[482:48.07]You guys gotta help me out on this one.
[482:50.96]Cause... I... It's... Every time that new Star Wars game comes up... It's like, don't play that shitty game.
[483:01.99]It's boring and sucks and like, the middle five to ten hours of that game is dog shit.
[483:09.01]And then another group of people say, it's so, it's great.
[483:12.12]It's so good, you're gonna love it.
[483:13.96]It's like, fuck.
[483:15.12]It's like, it's like so split.
[483:21.26]What I've been told is that it's fun.
[483:23.14]Like as a complete package, it's a fun game, but there's like an unbearable like string of five to six hours in the game that are just like, this game's stupid.
[483:44.23]You played Farmer's Dynasty.
[483:49.04]But you can't compare, hold on, you cannot compare the Farmer's Dynasty stream to if I'm going to actually sit down and play Star Wars The Fallen Order game.
[484:02.37]That's like, that's two different things going on there.
[484:07.41]I'm not going, when I opened up Farmer's Dynasty, we were, you know, that's the same mindset going and playing Star Wars on hard.
[484:19.88]You played this for eight hours.
[484:22.22]Yeah, but I'm not going to play this tomorrow for eight hours.
[484:25.52]If I play Star Wars tomorrow for eight hours, I'm going to play Star Wars again for eight hours the next day.
[484:33.18]We'll be flipping cars here.
[484:41.99]Yes, you will.
[484:42.53]You promised a roof car.
[484:44.03]So I can't play Star Wars tomorrow then because I can't put a car on a roof.
[484:50.17]How am I gonna put a car on a roof in a sniper game?
[484:53.63]No, I'm not gonna play this again.
[484:58.14]Let me get some more opinions on the Star Wars game.
[485:01.36]And then I'll just... I'll probably just end up playing the damn thing.
[485:04.36]You know what?
[485:04.74]I'm probably gonna play Outer Worlds.
[485:06.00]I'm gonna play the Star Wars game.
[485:07.36]The reason why I'm gonna say all this is because we're about to hit that point.
[485:12.07]After Holiday...
[485:14.69]You know, from November into December, there's gonna be like two or three months straight with nothing releases.
[485:22.88]So.
[485:24.52]We'll get a bunch of good stuff now.
[485:25.80]Alright, we'll figure it out, we'll figure it out, we'll figure it out, we'll figure it out.
[485:30.40]Guys, we're gonna figure it out.
[485:34.44]But.
[485:35.46]Uh, disinterest, thanks for the $3.50.
[485:36.72]Hey Jerma, I cried with laughing multiple times during this stream, just for your information.
[485:48.80]It was fun.
[485:50.46]I can't believe he's gonna play real games.
[485:53.28]What, Dead Rising and Dead Rising 2 aren't real games?
[485:55.86]Those are like some of the most beloved third-person action video games ever.
[486:02.88]Those are like two of the most beloved video games, like, ever.
[486:07.29]Everybody loves those games.
[486:08.49]They're like, those aren't real games?
[486:15.05]They're not, they're shit.
[486:16.59]Whoa!
[486:20.75]No one likes Dead Rising 2?
[486:22.10]I thought it was okay.
[486:31.66]Bumbo's not a real game?
[486:34.22]That just came out.
[486:35.66]Hold on.
[486:36.06]I want to go look at my past streams.
[486:38.89]What have I been playing?
[486:44.63]Bumbo's not a real game.
[486:45.89]Hold on.
[486:47.63]Let me see here.
[486:52.73]Okay, we had Farmer's Dynasty.
[486:54.22]Alright, I'll give you that one.
[487:00.56]Katamari is not a real game?
[487:03.80]Beautiful Katamari is not a real- What?
[487:14.09]Planet Zoo is a real game.
[487:21.05]What, you guys don't like Katamari?
[487:25.99]Only AAA games count.
[487:28.09]That's not fair.
[487:31.13]What was the last AAA game I played on this stream?
[487:33.57]I don't even play that.
[487:34.29]I don't play AAA games.
[487:37.37]What was the last AAA game I played on this stream?
[487:41.83]Let's go back and find out.
[487:47.46]I'm going to read every single video game I played in the last six months.
[487:50.32]Okay, we got Farmer
[487:56.19]Dead Rising.
[487:57.01]Katabari.
[488:00.42]Watching just chatting videos.
[488:02.14]Okay, right.
[488:02.60]That was Community Night.
[488:05.18]Planet Zoo.
[488:06.68]Is that AAA?
[488:08.32]Is Planet Zoo AAA?
[488:10.71]Not really.
[488:11.17]No, it's not.
[488:17.09]Parappa the Rapper is a AAA game.
[488:20.31]But does this have to be a AAA game that came out in the last five years?
[488:27.42]That was like a first-party Sony PlayStation 1 huge exclusive video game.
[488:31.88]It was huge.
[488:35.98]Darkwood.
[488:37.46]Fear.
[488:39.04]Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion.
[488:41.85]Numbers go up.
[488:43.53]Hitman 2.
[488:44.23]There you go.
[488:45.53]Found one.
[488:47.01]Hitman 2.
[488:47.37]That was two months ago.
[488:49.73]So every couple months we'll play like a AAA game.
[488:52.43]But I don't, I mean, they.
[488:53.53]They have to interest me.
[489:03.53]That's Hitman 2 DLC.
[489:05.47]Because it's DLC, it doesn't count?
[489:16.10]No, it counts.
[489:17.14]I played Hitman 2.
[489:18.60]It counts.
[489:23.34]God, I love that game.
[489:27.38]Hitman is just so...
[489:31.90]That's so fun.
[489:34.48]Star Wars isn't... Alright, well, so we gotta pick one.
[489:38.49]Every couple months, I play a AAA game.
[489:40.45]We gotta find a good one.
[489:41.53]It's gotta be one that I really wanna play.
[489:43.39]We got Outer Worlds.
[489:44.43]That's not AAA.
[489:45.79]Okay, we have Star Wars.
[489:48.53]AAA.
[489:49.74]That one's an option.
[489:58.04]Call of Duty.
[490:00.40]I don't play Call of Duty.
[490:01.96]No, I'm not going to play Call of Duty.
[490:02.96]All the AAA games are Call of Duty games anyways.
[490:08.61]What AAA games have released?
[490:10.31]Okay, AAA games.
[490:12.11]You guys act like these AAA games are like the grace of God.
[490:15.86]Let me see.
[490:16.26]AAA games that have released this year.
[490:18.90]Are they Battlefield and Call of Duty?
[490:29.16]Okay.
[490:30.39]Here we go.
[490:34.61]We've got... Metro Exodus is not a AAA game.
[490:47.69]Resident Evil 2.
[490:48.85]I played it.
[490:49.25]It was great.
[490:51.45]It is?
[490:51.59]What do you mean it is?
[490:53.35]Metro Exodus is a triple... No, it's not.
[491:02.59]It's published by Deep Silver.
[491:06.75]What do you guys... Okay, what's a AAA game to you guys?
[491:13.94]AAA means high production value.
[491:17.49]That's it.
[491:19.31]It means it's $60 and it was made by a bunch of people.
[491:22.29]High budget.
[491:30.38]Okay.
[491:32.06]Alright, so you got Metro Exodus.
[491:34.12]Kingdom Hearts 3.
[491:35.22]I'm not going to play that game.
[491:36.22]Why would I?
[491:37.74]Resident Evil 2, which was fantastic.
[491:39.55]Okay.
[491:41.21]Apex Legends.
[491:43.25]Why would I play that?
[491:46.53]Far Cry New Dawn.
[491:48.99]No.
[491:49.79]Anthem.
[491:50.47]Nope.
[491:51.73]The Division 2.
[491:52.87]Absolutely not.
[491:53.56]Why would I play that?
[491:55.68]Rage 2.
[491:56.10]Nope.
[491:56.52]Nope.
[491:58.52]Any of these ringing a bell for games that you desperately want me to- want to see me play?
[492:13.39]So then if I don't- if I don't- haven't played AAA games this year, then like what?
[492:16.69]You want me to play- you want me to play The Division 2?
[492:22.27]We need more Division 2 on this stream?
[492:26.70]Devil May Cry 5.
[492:27.98]Fuck.
[492:28.80]That's one.
[492:29.94]That's one that I... You got me.
[492:32.12]You got me there.
[492:37.85]Yeah, you got me.
[492:38.61]That's one that I really would have played.
[492:41.37]And I should have played.
[492:43.71]But, alright, so... And then Sekiro.
[492:46.07]And then Mortal Kombat 11 is on here, too.
[492:48.75]But, I mean, Mortal Kombat's a really, really cool thing, but I... It's a fighting game.
[492:52.91]I'm not... I don't really invest time into them.
[493:00.97]But as of all these ones on this list, I played the good ones.
[493:05.23]Resident Evil 2.
[493:06.17]That's a good one.
[493:08.65]Sekiro.
[493:09.15]That's one of the good ones.
[493:12.93]Devil May Cry 5 is the only one on this list, I think, that I haven't played that is like one of those single-player experiences.
[493:20.78]Put it on the list.
[493:21.28]We'll do it.
[493:22.44]The Witcher 3 came out like four years ago.
[493:27.04]Smash Ultimate.
[493:28.68]I played Smash Ultimate, but I didn't stream it.
[493:41.89]AAA, pronounced and sometimes written AAA, is an informal classification used for video games produced and distributed by a mid-sized or major publisher.
[493:58.21]Informal, informal.
[494:02.91]Now, I'm not against playing AAA games, but I just, I need to be into them.
[494:10.17]Crackdown 3 is technically a AAA game.
[494:14.45]And I'm not going to play that.
[494:22.12]To be completely and totally fair, though, Metro Exodus and Devil May Cry are the other two that I have not played this year.
[494:32.39]But the reason why I didn't play Metro Exodus is because...
[494:38.25]I had a meltdown during Last Light.
[494:41.63]I played it for like 30 minutes and I died like 10 times on like hardest difficulty and I like had a fucking meltdown and I quit the game forever.
[494:48.34]So like I can't just skip that game because I can't go back to that game.
[494:51.70]I've tried.
[494:52.06]I thought about it.
[494:55.48]I did the Metro 2033 and it was really good.
[494:58.60]It was awesome.
[494:59.72]And then I played Last Light and I had a full on like I can't do this meltdown.
[495:05.89]I just couldn't do it.
[495:06.53]I could not play the game.
[495:07.91]I don't know why.
[495:08.67]Something was going on.
[495:09.35]I put the difficulty in the wrong place.
[495:11.68]And I rage quit it.
[495:18.16]What about Sam and Max?
[495:19.04]That's not AAA.
[495:22.93]You do that a lot.
[495:23.91]I do not do that a lot.
[495:27.75]When was the last time I rage quit a game in 30 minutes and never played it again?
[495:33.88]It was Last Light.
[495:34.96]That was the last time I did that.
[495:36.90]You know how I know that?
[495:37.86]Because I remember it every damn day.
[495:43.55]Nioh.
[495:44.09]Yes, that did happen with Nioh 2, but that was way before Last Light.
[495:50.47]Hotline Miami?
[495:51.25]I beat Hotline Miami in Hotline Miami 2.
[495:53.16]What are you talking about?
[495:53.94]I'm talking about, like, when was the last time I raged?
[495:56.18]Yeah, I raged in Hotline Miami 2, but I stuck with it and beat the game.
[496:15.10]He checks out.
[496:15.70]Yeah, I know.
[496:16.44]I know I do.
[496:16.95]You even played Raid Shadow Legends.
[496:20.91]I don't even know what that is.
[496:26.65]Hey, Sosretto!
[496:27.81]Thanks for the $4.20.
[496:29.34]Hello, beauty.
[496:31.18]Hello, beauty lady.
[496:37.16]Remember the stream that would have been funny?
[496:41.35]We were talking in the pre-stream chat or I think it was maybe even the recommended on Discord.
[496:44.93]Somebody said just to open up my iPad.
[496:47.85]Open up a like the first YouTube video like I just open up as many YouTube videos as I can try to get ads and click on every ad for every mobile game that's an advertisement and play them.
[496:59.18]Download every ad game.
[497:04.58]Just go find them.
[497:05.74]Just open up any gaming website and just go click on every one of those ads and download those stupid banner ads.
[497:15.85]But then I thought it's probably a really bad idea.
[497:18.15]That's like a really easy way to get just like on like a never ending sucker list.
[497:35.29]Do it on a VM.
[497:38.51]Get an emulator specifically for virus streams?
[497:42.98]Just emulate Windows for, like, the specific virus mobile ad games.
[497:50.06]We'll see.
[497:50.58]It was a funny idea.
[497:55.49]Is there an update on the Sultan stream?
[497:57.05]Not yet.
[497:58.05]The Fuck the King server stuff is still being worked on.
[498:02.13]Which, actually, I can talk about this just a little bit before we go.
[498:06.80]This is going to be, and I've seen a lot of questions about this, this is going to be because it has to.
[498:13.82]And I really wish there was another way, but I really don't think there is.
[498:17.88]This has to be sub only.
[498:20.33]Not only does it have to be sub only, but it might have to be multiple month sub only to join this server.
[498:29.77]For a few different reasons.
[498:34.03]The unfortunate truth with a game like Minecraft is... ...somebody could just open up a script... ...and just... ...go in the server and just kill everybody.
[498:49.24]I have to be... I have to lock it down... ...where there's probably gonna be a whitelisting... ...uh, phase before, like a week or two before the stream.
[499:00.14]And I'm probably going to have to do not just a one month concurrent sub.
[499:06.42]Because then what you'll think about that scenario.
[499:08.99]Oh, okay.
[499:09.91]Well, it's sub only.
[499:11.33]I can get on that server.
[499:12.25]Alright.
[499:12.69]Let me just, I'll just pay $5 and then jump in and fucking destroy everybody.
[499:18.85]So it's going to have to be locked down.
[499:24.59]I've been trying to talk back and forth with people that are working on it.
[499:33.89]But we don't have a final game plan, I guess, yet.
[499:39.89]But it's absolutely going to be sub only and multi-month probably.
[499:44.93]So, and hopefully we can get enough of you in there.
[499:54.74]Tier 3 subs only.
[499:56.06]I'm not doing that.
[500:01.42]I think as long as you've been subbed for a full month, like you're on your second month, that's probably enough.
[500:08.55]Because that means that people can't just sub now and in like two or three or four weeks.
[500:13.17]This is probably not going to be happening for at least a few weeks.
[500:17.25]But I just don't want somebody to be able to sub, like, right now.
[500:19.99]And we'll have to find out.
[500:21.75]It might be three.
[500:22.77]I don't know.
[500:24.42]We're also trying to get in touch with some people that, like, code in Minecraft.
[500:29.94]And some anti-cheat people.
[500:31.64]And I want to make this really work.
[500:35.20]So I'm trying to put in... I'm trying to put my thumb in all the holes that are in the wall.
[500:43.50]That's why I've kind of just said, hey, I'm thinking about doing it, and I want to do it, and it's going to happen, but I'm not talking about it in the last few days.
[500:51.38]But there's an update on that.
[500:53.48]I know I've seen a lot of questions about that specifically.
[500:58.68]We'll see.
[501:01.02]But we have two more bits to do.
[501:05.67]Thank you, Malto.
[501:08.12]for the 500 bits.
[501:09.50]Hey, I'm struggling with the acne.
[501:12.74]Can you recommend me a good dermatologist?
