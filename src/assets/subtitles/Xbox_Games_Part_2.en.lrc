[ve:60.16.100]

[00:24.23]So I'm looking at my phone.
[00:26.79]And so I apparently never tweeted last night.
[00:31.43]I didn't tweet last night.
[00:33.00]Yesterday.
[00:34.82]So I open up my phone.
[00:35.58]This is the first time I've opened my phone.
[00:38.56]And I'm pretty sure like the entire 24 hour period since yesterday.
[00:43.30]And it's just Twitter is open with the tweet from yesterday.
[00:47.92]So I just have to delete a few lines and I'm ready to go.
[00:49.96]Look at this.
[00:53.87]I'm just gonna write, oh, it's at X, it's at PS1.
[00:56.29]I'm gonna write Xbox time.
[01:01.37]Oh, it's like already done for me.
[01:02.65]This is perfect.
[01:03.33]Alright.
[02:06.25]okay how you doing how are you so today we have uh the x the original Xbox is set up it's ready to go uh I have been playing oh my mic cut out oh whoops that's because I'm delayed by like a full second that's right so I'm on the original Xbox it's uh
[02:35.22]One of the reasons why I wanted to do this is because there are actually a lot of games that are not backwards compatible with the 360 or with any of the newer consoles.
[02:46.87]So some of these kind of just got like lost forever.
[02:52.52]And I have, I'd say half of the games I have for the Xbox are like that.
[02:59.03]There's still some here that work on the 360, but we've got the original set up.
[03:03.56]Let's see how long it takes us to go through the originals.
[03:08.86]So first up, which is kind of surprising that you can't really play it anywhere.
[03:12.88]I think it's on PC, but it's like a Windows.
[03:16.58]It's an old Windows game.
[03:19.79]Very old Windows game.
[03:24.25]So I'm trying to get the old like Windows, Windows 2000.
[03:38.00]Hold on.
[03:47.38]Okay.
[03:47.76]Sorry.
[03:47.96]I said to type.
[03:50.92]So, he's fake typing?
[03:53.02]No, I'm not.
[03:54.26]Why would I?
[03:55.18]I'm real typing.
[03:56.04]Why would I fake type for no reason?
[04:01.48]Wait, please see your evil face.
[04:07.02]No.
[04:10.47]But anyways, so what was I saying?
[04:11.41]Okay.
[04:12.09]So a lot of these old Xbox games cannot run on the 360.
[04:15.47]I have a 360.
[04:17.27]But some of these don't work.
[04:18.09]So I've owned some of these games for four or five years.
[04:21.34]They've been sitting on a shelf.
[04:23.36]Because it's like, oh, fuck, I can't play these on the 360.
[04:25.36]I thought 360 was backwards compatible.
[04:28.64]Maybe one day I'll get an original Xbox somehow.
[04:32.22]Maybe I'll do it.
[04:32.70]But here's that day today.
[04:34.32]We're there now.
[04:36.60]You are about to see games that are no longer available.
[04:42.35]Well, that's not true.
[04:43.07]You could probably... I mean...
[04:47.09]Look, I know that somebody's going to be like, whoa, what about just get an emulator?
[04:51.09]It's original hardware.
[04:52.99]I like original hardware because, I mean, yeah, emulators are great, but there's this period of emulation where once you hit the PS2 and PS3 era, like that PS2 Xbox into PS3, a lot of games have a ton of problems on emulators.
[05:12.92]They're... They get messed up.
[05:15.38]There's tons of bugs.
[05:16.35]There's graphical problems.
[05:17.41]You gotta, like... Oh, no, no.
[05:18.77]The problem is you need a different BIOS.
[05:20.25]I don't want to do all that.
[05:23.87]PS3 emulation is actually pretty great now.
[05:27.11]That's cool, because it wasn't a few years ago.
[05:29.70]When I... You know, three, four years ago.
[05:31.70]But also, I also... I don't know.
[05:33.38]If the game is still available, then, like, if I can play it on the original hardware, I'm going to.
[05:39.10]If it's not, then, of course, I have a different opinion, right?
[05:44.78]We're on original hardware today.
[05:49.62]When are you going to play boom blocks?
[05:53.90]This dude is lawful neutral.
[05:58.05]That's what you took out of that?
[06:00.07]He's lawful neutral.
[06:03.99]No, I'm not.
[06:04.79]Am I?
[06:07.33]What's that mean?
[06:17.36]Lawful neutral Andy.
[06:18.90]No, I'm not chaotic neutral.
[06:21.60]I'm not going to say that.
[06:26.40]I'm really not even that chaotic.
[06:27.98]I'm really not.
[06:37.24]Alright.
[06:37.68]Give me one more second.
[06:38.42]We're going to...
[07:25.84]you wearing a turtleneck why would I be wearing a turtleneck right now alright I'm gonna get started let's go it's time to play the matrix that's the first game I've got it's enter the matrix weirdly enough this game never got any it's probably honestly a lot of this is probably for licensing problems right
[07:54.67]You have to imagine that some of these did not get ported to the newer consoles because of that.
[08:00.16]Why did somebody just write, ha ha ha ha ha?
[08:02.02]Why did you do that?
[08:02.94]Explain it.
[08:04.60]This game rules.
[08:06.08]And I'm on original hardware, so this is... Oh, yeah, baby!
[08:10.72]Alright, I'm ready.
[08:11.64]Let's go.
[08:11.96]No more stalling.
[08:12.66]I'm ready to go.
[08:13.10]Can you do an Agent Smith impression?
[08:21.94]Mr. Anderson, it seems I am not the only spy.
[08:28.36]You are in deep trouble, Mr. Anderson.
[08:33.43]Pretty good, pretty good, pretty good!
[08:35.77]You know what was really cool about what just happened right there?
[08:38.49]That was the same audio clip three times in a row and I just did it just from my mouth.
[08:43.05]That was fucking awesome.
[08:44.66]And I'm gonna- I will die on that hill.
[08:46.44]That was actually really interesting what just happened.
[08:49.88]There was no difference in how I said all three of those.
[08:52.64]It was perfect each time.
[08:53.85]The same exact audio clip, and it was me talking.
[08:56.23]I win the argument, by the way.
[08:58.47]There was no argument.
[08:59.43]Alright, let's go.
[09:00.29]Let's go.
[09:02.93]I made sure this was playing the whole time because I was so afraid of the screen burning it.
[09:10.41]This trailer has been going on for, oh my goodness, it's got to be at least 20, 30 minutes at this point.
[09:18.74]I've just been playing this.
[09:23.13]So I've had to sit here and listen to this a while.
[09:24.99]Alright, you guys ready?
[09:28.80]You said you weren't chaotic.
[09:30.34]What's chaotic about saying pretty good three times in like a cool voice?
[09:34.87]I think that's pretty lawful neutral.
[09:38.51]That's 100% just neutral, right?
[09:41.94]Like I just said it perfectly.
[09:43.66]If I was chaotic, I would have said it differently three different times.
[09:47.10]I win.
[09:47.34]Alright, let's go.
[09:50.94]New game.
[09:53.19]I'm not playing on hard.
[09:56.68]Alright, we're doing the no save file.
[09:58.77]Let's go.
[09:59.99]That matrix save is good enough for me.
[10:03.83]Do hacking.
[10:05.13]No, I want to play.
[10:06.49]Why is this in 320p?
[10:07.63]Because I'm on.
[10:13.47]Is the burn in from there from last night?
[10:15.27]No, but I am actually so paranoid about it.
[10:19.53]Let me check.
[10:19.95]Hold on.
[10:22.13]If I turn this off.
[10:24.74]no it's not there thankfully alright quiet look at him like flies to cow pies crawling over every drop we ever used we didn't have a lot of time a lot of time wrong we don't have a little time
[10:46.92]Was this in the movie?
[10:47.48]Is this in the movie?
[10:48.42]I haven't seen the movie.
[10:49.14]I haven't seen The Matrix hidden.
[10:50.02]Alright.
[10:50.22]I...
[11:17.18]I saw the first Matrix, I saw the second Matrix, and then I didn't see the third one.
[11:25.50]Stop watching this.
[11:27.68]It's part of the video game.
[11:28.83]That's fine.
[11:32.93]This is exclusive footage.
[11:34.45]What the fuck?
[11:35.19]Quiet!
[11:35.69]Stop talking!
[11:36.27]You scattered the post office.
[11:38.99]Is the drop still clean?
[11:42.74]Niobe, this won't be easy.
[11:46.59]I'm not just watching The Matrix, I swear.
[11:48.99]Thaddeus was my friend.
[11:50.67]I knew him.
[11:51.67]He never used a drop before.
[11:53.88]He didn't trust him.
[11:56.52]Whatever's in that box cost Thaddeus his life and the lives of his crew.
[12:00.62]And I have a feeling if we don't get to it first, it's gonna cost us a whole lot more.
[12:05.86]So are you red or blue on this?
[12:10.25]You know me, Niobe.
[12:11.73]It's not a choice.
[12:14.13]Wait, didn't... Don't you already have to take the pill to do this in the first place?
[12:18.01]Wait.
[12:18.19]I thought they already took the pill to be able to be in this universe or something.
[12:23.21]I know how valued my opinion is on this ship.
[12:25.13]I won't bother to tell you.
[12:26.89]But I think it's insane for you not to wait for a support team.
[12:30.33]And for the record, when I cart your bodies back to Zion... Stop talking.
[12:33.34]...cremation or the gardens.
[12:34.78]Sparks your faith in us remains a source of personal inspiration.
[12:37.48]No, it's because this is flipped.
[12:38.40]I am what I am and I do what I can.
[12:39.64]It's bald both ways.
[12:40.38]Then can you shut up and hit the button?
[12:42.25]Your wish, captain, my captain, is my keystroke colon double backslash execute command.
[12:47.16]Okay, what happened?
[12:53.09]Oh, okay, I pick.
[12:54.51]I'll pick this ghost.
[13:10.74]Why do you do that?
[13:12.24]Do what?
[13:13.00]Check your guns.
[13:14.64]I can turn it up.
[13:15.18]You never know.
[13:16.40]It's a program.
[13:17.62]They get loaded every time the exact same way.
[13:20.48]Hume teaches us that no matter how many times you drop a stone and it falls to the floor.
[13:24.60]Tutorial?
[13:26.20]You never know what will happen the next time you drop it.
[13:28.44]It might fall to the floor, but then again it might float to the ceiling.
[13:33.05]Past experience can never prove the future.
[13:36.13]So?
[13:37.09]So you never know.
[13:38.41]Here we go.
[13:39.76]Cool.
[13:41.34]Alright, it's time.
[13:46.96]It doesn't matter how many times that happens, it would scare the shit out of me every time.
[13:49.94]To me, it's kind of like when a plane lands.
[13:52.01]When you're just like, you know, I've flown planes hundreds of times at this point, right?
[13:57.25]And the plane is like landing and it's just like, Okay, we're okay.
[14:00.87]Right?
[14:01.51]Like everybody kind of has that moment.
[14:20.91]Your call.
[14:22.29]Inside or out?
[14:24.37]I'll get the package.
[14:25.27]It doesn't matter how many times you fly a plane.
[14:27.41]It doesn't matter.
[14:27.99]There's that one second moment where you're just like, Ah!
[14:33.77]And that's it.
[14:36.02]And that's it.
[14:37.54]And you're fine.
[14:39.12]Save matrix.
[14:40.02]Yeah.
[14:41.38]Yeah.
[14:43.96]Is it burnt in?
[14:44.82]No, it's not.
[14:47.08]No.
[14:47.48]Why did I just check?
[14:48.57]No, it's fine.
[14:53.11]Alright, let's do it.
[14:55.13]Xbox night.
[14:58.75]The instant messaging window below is where messages appear from your operator, Sparks.
[15:03.43]Alright, what do I have to do?
[15:10.36]I thought I didn't get a tutorial.
[15:14.38]What the fuck is happening?
[15:15.30]I don't know how to play.
[15:22.90]Alright, where do I go?
[15:30.99]New tip!
[15:31.63]Fighting multiple enemies!
[15:32.77]What?
[15:32.95]What do you mean tip?
[15:35.11]I didn't- you didn't even tell me how to play!
[15:36.39]Alright, what do I do?
[15:42.53]Alright, that- wait, how do I play?
[15:47.77]Okay, what was the mission?
[15:53.52]Okay, that's punch.
[15:55.94]This combos?
[15:56.74]Alright, cool.
[15:58.34]You're supposed to read the manual.
[16:00.54]Ah, I don't have time for that.
[16:03.93]Okay, I have gun too?
[16:07.41]How do I open doors?
[16:12.25]It's just, dude, it's just kick and punch.
[16:14.06]Don't care, who cares?
[16:14.84]Don't worry about anything else.
[16:18.30]Oh wait, press the action button to activate switches.
[16:22.88]That's the telephone.
[16:26.02]This is blocked.
[16:27.56]Read the manual.
[16:28.32]There's no manual, guys!
[16:29.58]I don't have a manual!
[16:32.16]Oh, let's look at it.
[16:32.56]That's locked.
[16:36.83]That's locked.
[16:40.21]Should I restart?
[16:40.77]Did I do something wrong?
[17:01.88]Why are you so violent?
[17:12.15]What does it say?
[17:13.37]Kick the doors open.
[17:18.54]Okay, what do I do?
[17:21.39]Stop asking the question and play.
[17:23.91]Why am I doing this?
[17:25.23]Why am I asking you everything?
[17:27.66]Just walk around and figure it out.
[17:29.95]What am I talking about?
[17:39.23]I didn't like that was in one ear.
[17:40.75]What did he say?
[17:41.17]OK, pause menu and select objective.
[18:01.73]Oh, here we go.
[18:03.37]First person mode.
[18:04.15]You can view the environment from a first person.
[18:06.63]Press enter exit.
[18:07.95]First person to enter first person.
[18:10.00]Enter exit first person again.
[18:11.80]What?
[18:13.02]I can't even read this sentence.
[18:14.72]You can view the environment from a first person view.
[18:17.22]Through the eyes of your character.
[18:18.80]Press enter exit first person to enter first person mode.
[18:22.42]Press enter exit first person again.
[18:24.20]What button is that on the Xbox?
[18:29.17]They didn't tell me what button it is.
[18:32.58]I have X, Y, B, A... Left... Oh, first person mode.
[18:37.70]There it is.
[18:38.34]Sorry.
[18:38.80]First person exit enter.
[18:39.72]Okay.
[18:44.53]You can punch.
[18:45.37]You can kick.
[18:49.97]When running from agents to exit hand-to-hand combat mode, either press move away from the enemy, press fire, or press... I need to see these controls.
[19:00.32]multiple enemies at once from nearby all angles, tap movement, okay, yeah, I get it, I need the, there we go, focus, movement, weapons menu, pause, weapons select, target lock, action, what, where's, okay, first person, cool, alright, let's go, what box was it,
[19:35.75]Second floor, upstairs.
[19:36.63]I found a way inside.
[19:40.63]Try the security door behind the clerk's desk.
[19:44.35]Okay.
[19:49.34]How does this run?
[19:50.10]I'm in!
[19:59.64]I'm gonna watch this whole stream on the toilet.
[20:03.53]Make sure you stand up every so often because your circulation is going to get all fucked up to me.
[20:06.86]I'm in.
[20:07.26]Why did you tell me to come to this door if you're not going to open it?
[20:35.72]Why did he do that?
[20:40.39]Did you hear a word he said?
[20:41.71]Yeah, he said, go to the freight, uh, freight station.
[20:44.41]Somewhere over in the freight area.
[20:46.91]I don't know.
[20:47.33]I thought he was gonna open a door.
[20:49.11]Press fire to draw a weapon.
[21:01.82]Well, there is no bumper on the original Xbox.
[21:15.49]What's fire?
[21:19.23]I don't have... I have changed weapon, I thought.
[21:23.02]Wait, what's fire?
[21:26.44]Fire is... What are these two weird buttons?
[21:30.22]What are these two weird buttons?
[21:32.22]What the hell are these?
[21:33.70]Huh?
[21:35.13]There's... I... What are these two buttons?
[21:39.49]There's a white and black button?
[21:42.09]Holy shit, I didn't know that.
[21:45.75]Look at this thing.
[21:48.97]There's two buttons here.
[21:52.51]They were invisible to me.
[21:54.77]Why are you such a zoomer?
[21:55.95]I never had an Xbox.
[21:57.25]Okay.
[22:07.70]That's actually... I don't like pressing that all the way down there.
[22:12.06]Stop.
[22:12.80]Put it away.
[22:16.10]That's so far away.
[22:17.44]This is the worst controller.
[22:18.66]He has small hands?
[22:30.15]No, it's just... What a bad controller this is.
[22:39.18]White and black were bumper equivalents.
[22:41.46]Really?
[22:41.86]Okay, well...
[22:53.35]What was that?
[22:54.25]Why are we in like this split screen?
[23:01.10]How did I just do that?
[23:02.12]I don't know.
[23:06.73]This game is awesome.
[23:09.03]This is- what a fun game this really is.
[23:13.67]How would this not- why wouldn't they get the licensing figured out to get this game on the 360 or something?
[23:18.56]What are they thinking?
[23:28.56]There's a PC version.
[23:29.78]Yeah, but PC version, you have to jump through like 10 hoops to get it to run sometimes, especially on a new computer.
[23:34.75]If it has like Windows 10, Windows 11, it's just like, like when you have set up like a virtual machine at some point, like yuck.
[24:04.35]I missed so many times, but whatever.
[24:10.61]To climb fences, move toward the fence and your character will begin to automatically climb it.
[24:28.66]Ow!
[24:30.15]Shoot him!
[24:31.13]Shoot him!
[24:33.17]Shoot him!
[24:35.15]What?
[24:41.65]I have no more ammo?
[24:59.31]Wait, these are... Okay, wait, these are... What am I... What am I doing?
[25:07.18]What's the point of that?
[25:10.08]Why did they just do that to that guy?
[25:14.48]Over here, I see him.
[25:16.55]Dude, if you're in a full sprint like that, like, what do you do?
[25:22.25]Like, stop.
[25:23.51]Stop that.
[25:24.17]Stop doing that.
[25:24.87]Oh, no.
[25:32.46]Don't go up.
[25:33.16]I think they're expecting you.
[25:34.28]Cops are everywhere on that second floor.
[25:42.98]Uh-oh.
[25:44.42]Special moves?
[25:54.80]Ow!
[25:54.86]Go over there and fight him!
[25:56.10]Go over and jump to him!
[26:17.96]Wait, there's weapons.
[26:33.12]Wall press?
[26:38.59]I'm alright.
[26:46.39]Am I wall press?
[27:01.27]I don't know.
[27:05.08]Shoot around corners.
[27:48.44]How do I get out of this?
[28:02.22]Oh, I got him.
[28:09.87]This game is so fun.
[28:11.13]Alright.
[28:15.99]Cool.
[28:16.33]This game's fun.
[28:23.62]Grenade.
[28:27.30]Yeah.
[28:32.33]Stay above the gas.
[28:33.27]Then get out.
[28:33.73]How do I do that?
[29:09.47]Where do I go?
[29:13.78]Stay above the gas?
[29:18.18]Wait, this room's not full of gas?
[29:35.15]I'm gonna die.
[29:35.45]I'm gonna die.
[29:35.93]I'm gonna die.
[29:36.33]I'm gonna die.
[29:36.79]I'm gonna die.
[29:37.21]I'm gonna die.
[29:39.90]Oh, the gas is in here.
[29:40.80]Alright, I was confused.
[29:42.02]I got confused.
[29:42.54]I got confused.
[29:42.96]It's fine.
[29:44.78]First, I wasn't getting hit by the gas.
[29:47.26]And then I was hit by the gas.
[29:48.25]I get it.
[29:48.51]I understand.
[29:49.53]Takes me a second.
[29:53.27]I was too busy making the dumb joke.
[29:55.77]I thought security had the elevator covered.
[30:10.27]I got it.
[30:40.32]Pretty sick.
[30:44.52]Alright, here's the help.
[30:50.74]Ooh, I just punched him right in the throat.
[31:06.25]Okay, now I'm not messing around.
[31:08.95]The gas is over here somewhere.
[31:19.57]Shoot him!
[31:20.17]What are you doing?
[31:38.77]Dude, just attack somebody!
[31:39.99]What are you doing?
[31:42.49]You need to wall run, damn it.
[31:47.22]How do I do that?
[31:52.18]Face an object such as a wall, then tap movement forward as if to walk into the wall.
[31:55.60]Your character will turn their back and press up against the object.
[31:57.82]Okay.
[32:00.27]Uh, wall press, wall run?
[32:05.23]Is this correct?
[32:07.40]When a wall press, strive left and right or move left and right to move along the object.
[32:21.87]Oh, okay.
[32:26.01]Cool.
[32:26.29]Alright, I get it.
[32:26.91]Alright, let's do it.
[32:35.13]Don't turn around and go the wrong way.
[32:39.39]So the correct way is over there.
[32:58.37]Wait, where am I going?
[32:59.16]I don't understand.
[33:01.32]But I'm going to get a lot of this gas down here.
[33:03.92]Can I jump on this?
[33:09.50]Need to use focus?
[33:10.88]Climb up the fence.
[33:19.53]Get up there!
[33:20.03]What are you doing?
[33:20.73]I don't get it!
[33:27.77]Somebody said, I hated this level when I was a kid.
[33:37.52]Where are these vents?
[33:44.72]I don't think this is correct.
[33:59.24]Ah!
[34:02.33]Shit.
[34:02.83]No, go back.
[34:04.49]Go back.
[34:07.61]I don't want to do this again.
[34:08.93]I really don't want to do this level again.
[34:10.53]I don't want to do it again.
[34:11.35]I really don't.
[34:20.09]I just had three arms.
[34:23.78]Ow!
[34:39.67]Look for us.
[34:42.01]Skylight?
[34:42.99]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[34:44.09]Get down, get down, get down.
[34:46.41]Hey!
[34:46.79]Get off the first person, you idiot!
[34:49.20]Skylight!
[34:50.28]Ah!
[34:52.10]Holy shit, I made it.
[34:52.80]Okay, we're good.
[35:00.40]I have 2% health.
[35:06.47]Did I softlock myself?
[35:12.41]I hope not.
[35:13.97]Is there health anywhere?
[35:19.90]There's no health.
[35:21.26]I have to actually be stealthy.
[35:45.08]Didn't even fucking see me coming.
[35:52.91]Hey, wait wait!
[36:19.77]What are you doing?
[36:30.75]That's fucked.
[36:33.04]That would be the quickest way for me to die.
[36:35.12]This dude is fucked up.
[36:41.40]I'm coming through the grate!
[36:43.39]No, you're not, man.
[36:44.31]You're not gonna make it.
[36:47.95]If I sit here long enough, it'll recharge.
[36:52.49]Just anger overtook this character.
[36:56.85]I'm going to get through that chain link fence.
[36:59.07]I just said happy birthday.
[37:02.80]Okay, wait.
[37:06.44]I'm waiting until full health.
[37:07.58]I'm not messing this up.
[37:44.47]Holy shit.
[37:45.47]I just... I just destroyed that guy.
[37:47.79]That was awesome.
[37:50.05]Health is recharging.
[37:51.13]I'm not gonna be stupid.
[37:51.63]This game's hard.
[38:06.51]Just run by.
[38:07.19]I can't... I can't hit them.
[38:08.89]Wait, what about behind the energy drink container?
[38:16.73]No!
[38:17.05]Go!
[38:17.33]Just run.
[38:20.56]I'm good.
[38:44.28]The 85th birthday.
[38:45.00]This dude can't hear me through the wall.
[38:47.02]It's a window.
[39:20.23]soundproof dive through glass oh no way how do I do that kick through glass windows we're running okay
[39:49.15]Make this fucking epic.
[40:22.57]What's with my health being so reduced?
[40:24.87]Nice.
[40:48.37]Shoot this guy!
[40:49.21]What are you doing?
[41:15.47]Your character will automatically duck under low-hanging... Okay.
[41:23.32]How do I crouch?
[41:25.03]Is there a crouch?
[41:44.99]Dude, stop kicking.
[41:47.59]I put too many inputs in.
[42:03.84]It's locked.
[42:07.82]Oh, hold on.
[42:10.04]Go.
[42:14.87]Can I talk?
[42:15.11]Is there a talk button?
[42:16.21]No, it's not talk.
[42:45.49]I'm not gonna do it.
[42:48.03]Need to power up the lobby elevator.
[42:50.08]There should be a switch somewhere on the control panel.
[42:58.96]Alright guys, had to come in and press the big button.
[43:19.53]How's the audio?
[43:20.42]Is the audio still okay?
[43:23.44]You want to do a couple quick tests?
[43:26.23]Hello there!
[43:26.89]My name is Jerma.
[43:28.31]Does it work?
[43:29.69]It's good, right?
[43:45.99]He didn't even know what was that he just went like that Okay The combos about who made this game
[44:19.45]Who made this?
[44:21.67]What company made this?
[44:24.53]Shiny?
[44:26.91]Shiny Entertainment?
[44:35.77]This is pretty good for thinking about how it holds up.
[44:40.93]This actually kind of holds up pretty well.
[44:44.59]This is fun.
[44:58.14]Wait, the Shiny Entertainment that made Earthworm Jim?
[45:00.88]Wait, Shiny Entertainment?
[45:05.44]What?
[45:10.21]The devs that made Earthworm Jim made Enter the Matrix and MDK.
[45:16.39]You know what's crazy about MDK?
[45:18.73]I remember that being on a demo disk.
[45:23.76]Way back in the day, and I played that demo disk a million times.
[45:28.92]I didn't even know what the game was.
[45:36.60]What happened to that guy?
[45:44.83]Yeah, there was level one of MDK.
[45:48.72]was on some old demo disk, and I remember just playing it over and over.
[45:52.94]Those old demo discs were so awesome.
[45:54.82]Do you know how many times I played level one of Parappa the Rapper?
[46:03.85]It had to have been hundreds of times.
[46:05.15]Uh...
[46:21.59]Alright.
[46:24.85]Let's go.
[46:27.13]Were they awesome sauce or just regular awesome?
[46:29.67]I don't know.
[46:36.98]Please do a demo disk night.
[46:38.60]I feel like it wouldn't hit as hard as it did back a long time ago.
[46:57.73]Do it, please.
[47:02.03]By the way, this is a long first level.
[47:04.35]I feel like I've been here this, like, tutorial level.
[47:10.36]Where are they going?
[47:16.14]What?
[47:27.76]Let's go.
[47:31.52]Used to get them in magazines.
[47:33.84]Yeah.
[47:40.41]You know, I might be just completely speaking totally, completely out of line here.
[47:45.35]But... Do video games really do anything kind of funny and fun like that anymore?
[47:50.43]Not funny, but you know what I mean?
[47:52.24]Like, oh, it's like a little thing we're gonna put in the box.
[47:55.83]People don't really have a box, right?
[47:58.85]Like, oh, here's like a preview for... And it was weird because wasn't it sometimes it'd be like two discs in the PlayStation 1 case?
[48:06.63]It's like, oh, here's... By the way, here's like some weird DVD extras.
[48:11.26]Like, oh, cool.
[48:19.62]No, good riddance.
[48:23.74]What?
[48:24.56]You don't want like some fun thing just to kind of browse around when you're just kind of bored one day?
[48:28.46]What do you mean good riddance?
[48:33.02]That's DLC now.
[48:41.77]A special edition of Halo 2 and 3 had extra discs.
[48:43.91]It was awesome with behind the scenes stuff.
[48:47.33]Uh, hold on.
[48:47.67]I gotta pay attention for a second.
[48:54.08]Oh.
[49:00.61]I have an unbelievably brilliant idea and I don't want to tell anybody because it's so good that I feel like somebody would steal it.
[49:08.03]I might just figure out how to do it one day.
[49:13.37]It's actually like a 100 out of 100 on a point scale for like how cool this would be.
[49:18.40]I wish people would do it.
[49:20.28]I can't tell you.
[49:25.06]Because somebody's going to hear this, and you'll be on Shark Tank in two weeks.
[49:28.80]And I'll be like, that was my shit, and I shouldn't have said it.
[49:39.25]That's such a weird flex.
[49:43.35]I'm telling you, I have an unbelievable idea.
[49:47.35]And it's so good.
[49:48.37]It's so good.
[49:49.39]It makes me angry that nobody did it yet.
[49:52.92]It makes me fucking mad that nobody's done it yet, and it's... There's only two people on Earth that know what this is.
[50:04.05]Ollie and Otto.
[50:06.29]I told Otto very, very detailed information about this.
[50:23.54]Otto is a spy.
[50:24.60]Dude, one time... This is completely unrelated, but it's just so stupid.
[50:33.98]One time... So, I like... Okay.
[50:39.61]I don't want this to burn in.
[50:40.37]I have to do something.
[50:41.25]I have to literally run in a circle.
[50:43.23]It's so annoying that I have to do that.
[50:46.01]It's going to be hard to talk.
[50:48.97]I don't care.
[50:49.49]Okay.
[50:50.71]So, I like to... It's a new hobby that I have.
[50:54.83]I'll tell you about my hobby.
[50:56.59]So, I like to collect, at this point right now, playing cards.
[51:02.15]I like cards.
[51:03.23]You know, like Ace, King, Queen, Jack.
[51:06.20]There's so many different decks.
[51:07.08]There's so many cool things to kind of find.
[51:10.80]Oh, wow.
[51:11.18]There's so many different artwork that you can collect.
[51:13.22]There's so many different kinds of styles.
[51:15.54]And it's fun.
[51:16.78]It's fun.
[51:17.10]They're not that expensive.
[51:18.07]It's just like, okay, cool.
[51:19.75]But you're a psycho.
[51:20.99]Yeah, some people collect coins.
[51:22.21]I like playing cards.
[51:24.78]Let him cook.
[51:25.44]Exactly!
[51:26.28]Let me cook!
[51:28.24]So, um...
[51:31.41]Sometimes it's fun just to kind of play cards on the couch.
[51:34.76]It's like, you know, like Polly's right here.
[51:37.18]I'm right here.
[51:39.08]And Otto is like asleep.
[51:41.50]Kind of on the couch over there.
[51:43.32]Like over here.
[51:44.30]Like to the left.
[51:46.13]And we just deal Otto in.
[51:49.29]And like we were playing poker.
[51:52.33]It's just like, okay, like here you go.
[51:55.15]Here's your cards.
[51:56.21]Here's my cards.
[51:56.80]Here's Otto's cards.
[51:59.14]And it got to a point where we just started laughing and we were just like, what are we doing?
[52:04.36]Because it's like, oh, what do you got?
[52:06.58]Oh, no, no, I fold.
[52:08.16]Oh, this is what I got.
[52:09.12]And I look at Otto's cards and I go, oh, Otto folds.
[52:12.71]He's just like lying on his side, just sleeping and snoring.
[52:17.93]It's like he's not even participating.
[52:19.23]Why is he in?
[52:20.01]Why are we doing this?
[52:22.71]Like, oh, Otto folds.
[52:24.89]Like, what was the point?
[52:30.51]This is, that was, that's cute.
[52:32.85]It's just for fun.
[52:34.03]I don't even care.
[52:36.60]But anyways, it's just funny.
[52:39.04]Like he's not giving like, oh, look, look, he's playing too.
[52:43.08]Isn't that cute?
[52:44.66]Otto has no idea what the hell we're doing.
[52:47.21]He doesn't care at all.
[52:49.85]He's just asleep.
[52:52.61]You should let Otto win.
[53:01.70]You should ban Otto.
[53:02.69]He counts cards.
[53:04.83]But anyways, yes, I've been, I've been, I like, I don't have that many.
[53:08.25]I probably have seven or eight decks total.
[53:13.57]It's fine.
[53:14.82]Some people collect coins.
[53:16.18]Some people collect
[53:19.50]Look, alright, you know what?
[53:20.42]Some people collect CARS.
[53:22.68]I don't- I'm not gonna do that.
[53:23.88]I'll take the- I'll take the cards.
[53:26.24]Did I say- What did I just say?
[53:27.06]Did I say- No.
[53:28.51]Yeah, some people collect cards.
[53:30.25]Cars.
[53:31.61]Right.
[53:32.59]I ain't doing that.
[53:33.13]Okay, jump from behind cover.
[53:43.19]Cool.
[53:47.03]You- Hey, whatever you want to collect, that's up to you.
[53:50.67]and collect whatever you want if it's cars if it's uh coins if it's playing cards if it's video games people old video games collecting old video games who's auto I don't I hate that turn this off turn the sound off
[54:36.12]That's really cool.
[54:43.19]Oh my goodness.
[54:46.29]Dude, how do you fucking win?
[54:49.66]Dude, how do you win?
[54:51.00]There's too many people.
[54:51.92]Oh my god.
[54:59.42]Skill issue.
[55:03.51]People that don't have the context that Otto is a dog are confused.
[55:10.48]What?
[55:10.74]There's just some guy, Otto, that's here?
[55:12.60]Oh, you know what?
[55:16.18]Otto falls.
[55:16.96]There's just a guy lying there?
[55:21.11]Otto is a dog.
[55:22.01]Otto is my dachshund mix.
[55:36.08]OK, don't mess it up here.
[55:38.62]I'm just going to hide.
[55:39.30]I'm going to hide in the corner.
[55:41.74]Just yeah, that's the best way to do it.
[55:43.78]Wait, how long ago was this?
[55:46.06]This is so long ago.
[55:55.06]Why was there no checkpoint here?
[56:04.87]Why was there no checkpoint?
[56:24.54]Skill issue?
[56:25.43]I'll show you a skill issue.
[56:26.45]Okay, right this way.
[56:29.22]Wait for me.
[56:54.11]Alright, let's not mess this up, please.
[57:06.36]How did you choose Otto's name?
[57:10.14]That was Otto's name already.
[57:12.88]So Otto was a rescue.
[57:15.98]And he was already two or three years old.
[57:18.78]And kind of already knew his name.
[57:20.94]So I was just like, yeah, we'll just keep it that way.
[57:28.70]Alright, here we go.
[57:29.52]What are you doing?
[57:42.85]Shoot him!
[57:43.31]I just got so angry.
[57:47.49]What the fuck?
[57:48.67]This level is so hard.
[58:14.48]You have focus, but I shot those guys like a thousand times.
[58:22.06]Oh, come on.
[58:23.34]What?
[58:24.50]Those guys weren't even... My eyes are so itchy.
[58:41.65]Okay.
[58:43.72]The whole game is difficult.
[58:44.74]It's very cheap in the later levels.
[58:46.38]Oh, great.
[58:48.32]Well, it's a good thing we have a time limit on all of these games we play.
[59:07.23]I wish there was a checkpoint here.
[59:11.85]Spamming is the meta.
[59:12.93]Don't be afraid to spam.
[59:14.63]So wait, it's not about looking cool.
[59:16.29]It's about just spamming as much as you possibly can.
[59:18.72]Are you going to play Elmo's Preschool?
[59:22.58]No, probably not.
[59:23.96]That game's way too hard.
[59:24.66]Especially the last boss is just like fucking stupid.
[59:34.84]The dodge mechanic in that game is so annoying.
[59:38.58]When you're in like the... When you go to that... Like kind of... Hold on.
[59:48.70]What the fuck?
[59:59.67]It's too hard.
[60:02.51]Which is the underworld level is just like... I don't know.
[60:08.83]They give you like five health potions.
[60:10.23]And they think you can beat that like Satan character.
[60:13.65]With five.
[60:14.19]Which is like... It's just... I don't know.
[60:16.94]You can only heal like... A few times during that fight.
[60:23.88]True.
[60:24.30]I don't know.
[60:25.62]It's alright.
[60:26.14]That's not bad.
[60:28.91]Okay.
[60:48.78]Don't do that anymore.
[60:50.36]Something is in my eye and it's causing me stress.
[60:58.70]Ow.
[60:59.88]No, you piece of shit.
[61:17.20]Fuck, this game is impossible.
[61:18.64]Holy shit, dude.
[61:20.96]This game is like not even beatable.
[61:26.96]Excuse me?
[61:29.71]I don't understand.
[61:30.47]Those guys were on the ground dead and then they... Alright, I'm not... I'm doing this for real this time.
[61:35.26]I'm not going to talk about LEGO.
[61:36.76]Elmo has a funny game with like a dodge mechanic.
[61:40.75]Stop and play.
[62:21.72]You didn't see him flank in plain view.
[62:57.73]I want that health.
[62:59.87]Actually, it'll go up.
[63:02.29]Stop walking into bullets.
[63:06.81]Watch this clip.
[63:08.07]This is as bad as singing the Braids song?
[63:11.62]What Braids song are you talking about?
[63:18.19]Why am I losing health?
[63:32.26]Okay, I am going to try as hard as I can.
[63:35.13]I'm not going to talk.
[63:35.81]I'm not going to say a single sentence.
[63:37.11]I promise.
[63:37.57]Where are the enemies?
[64:04.91]Shoot to kill.
[65:05.87]What am I doing?
[65:06.35]What's happening?
[65:06.77]What am I doing?
[65:07.19]Alright, go.
[65:21.27]Nice.
[65:21.93]Pick up that phone.
[65:41.21]That just kind of scared me.
[65:55.44]Yes, thank God.
[65:59.32]Thank goodness.
[66:08.46]Did you play Peglin?
[66:09.62]I did not.
[66:19.14]What the hell happened?
[66:20.40]I'm still in the first level.
[66:21.44]I created a distraction for you.
[66:22.90]A distraction?
[66:24.08]To do anything other than ruin my roof escape.
[66:27.01]Oh, yeah.
[66:27.91]Hold on.
[66:30.29]I think I've got something.
[66:31.45]What you need to do is find the manager's office.
[66:33.99]It's near the elevator control room you were just in.
[66:36.89]What is coming out of that?
[66:37.95]From the second floor.
[66:39.69]Sorry.
[66:40.07]Is that a big ice maker?
[66:42.25]You can make it.
[66:43.51]Just call me when you get there.
[66:56.23]It's money.
[66:58.73]Oh, it is money.
[66:59.47]That'd be so cool if there was a counter up in the top right that was like like hundreds, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred.
[67:18.78]That guy almost just killed me.
[67:30.40]How come there's no side jump?
[68:02.55]There is.
[68:02.87]I mean, I can side jump out of the out of cover.
[68:13.84]I want to like side jump right now.
[68:19.28]I hope I'm going the right way because I have absolutely no idea where I'm going.
[68:58.31]See ya.
[69:00.79]Okay.
[69:03.01]I think I got it.
[69:14.98]This game looks pretty sick.
[69:16.94]The game is pretty sick.
[69:20.46]Can you wall run in real life?
[69:23.22]You know, I actually feel like I probably can.
[69:25.80]You know those things that you've never really tried that much before, but you're just so confident that you could?
[69:30.74]I think I can.
[69:34.30]I could probably get at least one, two, three, four, five steps.
[69:38.35]Or at least one, two, three, four.
[69:42.69]If I was in full sprint and I was like, I could do at least four.
[69:57.74]Where did these guys even come from?
[70:02.41]Do it on the Battleaxe stream?
[70:05.83]I... Alright.
[70:08.11]That's fine.
[70:09.02]Want me to add more things that I can prove that I can do?
[70:12.86]We'll get a list.
[70:13.72]I'll do them all.
[70:34.94]How did you shoot me more than I shot you?
[70:38.92]Oh, that's how you do that.
[70:56.37]Oh, goodness.
[71:04.07]Ah.
[71:29.38]Just do.
[71:29.96]I just did a split in the air.
[71:40.27]That would be so scary.
[71:45.17]I have no bullets.
[71:49.16]Oh, fuck!
[71:58.95]What are you doing?
[72:17.12]Get out!
[72:34.02]What am I doing?
[72:35.06]I don't know.
[72:35.40]I don't understand what to do.
[72:36.78]Should I run?
[72:45.45]What?
[72:45.61]Am I missing something or do I have to fight?
[73:01.82]They can definitely see me.
[73:20.87]I kicked that guy through the glass.
[73:29.14]Dude, what the?
[73:36.47]I gotta climb this.
[73:37.97]No, I don't.
[73:44.25]That hurt me.
[73:48.16]Where do I go?
[74:08.89]You gotta eat.
[74:10.01]Dude, they're just coming out of nowhere.
[74:28.16]They're actually spawning out of nowhere.
[74:29.42]I'm not- I have to go somewhere.
[74:53.13]Come on, man.
[74:55.05]Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.
[74:56.17]Got a plan.
[74:57.05]Just let me work the timing.
[75:00.59]Okay, put your back to the city map.
[75:03.15]It's opposite the big window.
[75:06.39]Good.
[75:07.05]Now, hang tight for a minute.
[75:09.15]Here we go.
[75:10.75]Now, when I say go, I want you to run for that big window in front of you and jump through it.
[75:18.75]That's the same.
[75:20.89]Is it the same model?
[75:30.66]Something's burnt into the bottom left of the screen and I don't know what it is.
[75:33.16]There is text burnt into the bottom left.
[75:38.89]What is it?
[75:54.42]Is it loading screen?
[75:56.92]Is it select?
[76:11.79]No, it's loading.
[76:14.19]Yep.
[76:15.21]That is slowly being burnt into the screen.
[76:19.57]How old is your capture card?
[76:25.03]Hold on, something important just happened.
[76:36.25]What am I firing at?
[76:41.37]It's inverted too, this sucks.
[76:50.38]There's nobody to shoot.
[76:54.35]I could be inside the car right now.
[77:01.55]Does nobody shoot?
[77:06.90]Oh, now there is.
[77:14.76]Unreal Engine demo.
[77:18.03]This is so fucking loud.
[77:20.09]Can anybody even hear me?
[77:24.09]Why am I doing this?
[77:34.60]Dude, you know, I have to tell you something.
[77:37.02]It's very important, and I have to pause it for this, because you can't hear me.
[77:40.89]This reminds me of arcade games that are, you know, light gun arcade games.
[77:45.29]Can somebody explain to me, please?
[77:47.25]Tell me why.
[77:48.52]Explain to me.
[77:49.84]Why is every light gun game stuck in, like, 2003?
[77:56.31]Every light gun game, they're on the same technology, the same kind of graphics engines.
[78:02.98]Why are they all so kind of scuffed?
[78:09.40]Every game I've ever played at an arcade, it's never progressed past like 2003.
[78:18.76]No, they did not stop being made.
[78:20.78]There are new ones.
[78:21.92]There are new ones that come out.
[78:23.98]And I've played some of these new ones and they are terrible.
[78:28.66]They are brand new games.
[78:30.50]And you know what they do?
[78:31.56]This is what they do instead.
[78:33.38]Instead of it looking good and playing good, you go into this weird audio world where it's like, we have subwoofers built in.
[78:42.10]So don't pay attention to the 25 FPS awful shooting game.
[78:48.76]They make these, like, weird sit-in Disney kind of rides, where it's just like, oh, okay, I'm ready.
[78:53.61]And it just shakes and screams at you, but the game's terrible.
[78:58.97]What happened?
[79:07.86]Why are all these games just stuck in the same era?
[79:12.68]Is it impossible to make a game that's got like 20, 15 graphics and plays well?
[79:18.92]Why do they all run like such shit too?
[79:25.87]Burn in.
[79:28.97]I'm so paranoid about the burn in, I thought the health 93% was burnt in.
[79:35.67]What if I just don't shoot anyone?
[79:43.98]I don't know if that was scripted or not, but I would be dead.
[79:52.38]My head would have been crushed five times.
[79:54.72]I'm not shooting anybody.
[80:00.66]This guy sucks at driving.
[80:08.40]What is happening to the car?
[80:10.78]Oh my god.
[80:20.34]Wait, wait, I'm not driving.
[80:23.16]Who's driving?
[80:29.40]I would be driving better than this.
[80:38.11]This feels like I'm playing GTA Online.
[80:42.03]This is exactly what it's like.
[80:45.88]Did the bridge just spawn?
[80:48.97]What was that?
[80:50.63]Why did the bridge just spawn?
[81:06.50]It's the matrix.
[81:07.72]Oh, it is the matrix.
[81:19.78]I'll tell you something, that has increased.
[81:22.32]You know what has increased?
[81:23.62]Not the quality of the light gun games, but how much they cost to play.
[81:30.47]Interesting.
[81:45.13]She aimed that gun like she was casting a spell.
[81:47.95]Uh-oh.
[81:48.39]Here he is.
[82:25.08]Yeah, no pinball tables is bullshit.
[82:27.18]You know what?
[82:27.46]There are a lot of places that are starting to kind of try to do the old-fashioned arcade stuff.
[82:32.48]That's really cool.
[82:39.81]If I ever had an arcade, it would just be free pizza.
[82:43.17]But you had to be, like, playing.
[82:46.59]That's a casino.
[82:48.49]Never mind.
[82:57.32]Free pizza.
[82:58.90]It's just like a waiter or a waitress rocking around.
[83:01.48]Pizza?
[83:02.00]Anybody want some pizza?
[83:03.20]Oh, yeah, I'll take a slice.
[83:04.90]Instead of alcohol.
[83:08.42]I'm sorry, but that's fucking cool.
[83:11.18]That's, I would go there.
[83:15.62]But then, logistically, it would be hard because people get greasy fingers all over the controls.
[83:21.85]Imagine somebody walking around with like a piping hot pizza, walking around like the, I almost just said casino floor.
[83:27.68]Imagine walking on the casino floor.
[83:30.41]Where's that?
[83:51.74]I didn't know what the constraints were of the video game.
[83:57.70]I actually didn't mean to do that one.
[84:03.22]Greasy controllers are given at an arcade.
[84:05.32]They always have bar food.
[84:07.64]You know what?
[84:10.64]What's going on here?
[84:12.68]You come to my arcade, okay?
[84:16.23]As long as you're playing, you know, you're playing.
[84:18.07]Hey.
[84:18.25]I don't even want to like slice.
[84:20.84]How are you doing over there?
[84:22.34]By the way, no toppings or no bullshit.
[84:24.66]No toppings.
[84:26.48]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[84:27.32]Excuse me.
[84:28.40]Oh yeah, I'll have pepperoni and olives.
[84:29.84]No, no, no.
[84:30.44]This is cheese only.
[84:31.98]By the way.
[84:32.37]What do you mean fuck that?
[84:39.51]No toppings.
[84:40.25]No toppings.
[84:44.74]You know how difficult it would be to actually logistically put that together?
[84:47.50]Hold on a second.
[84:52.18]Oh, I had an opportunity.
[84:54.50]I just need to... I'm sorry, everyone.
[84:55.82]I need to do this.
[84:56.98]This is for the video.
[84:58.83]This is for the video.
[85:03.53]And three, two, one.
[85:09.61]This is for the video.
[85:12.50]Let's go!
[85:13.84]It is I, Superman!
[85:15.48]What the... the heck?
[85:28.11]It's gonna be... I can see it.
[85:30.05]People can rewind and watch it rewind.
[85:32.39]It's gonna have a huge hump for a replayed part of the video.
[85:43.41]Ladders.
[85:44.19]How do these work?
[85:49.91]Oh.
[85:59.26]Can you imagine?
[86:00.30]That place would be disgusting.
[86:03.16]They would just be... People would drop full cheese slices.
[86:06.32]Cheese side down on the ground.
[86:08.75]You know what I'm talking about?
[86:09.49]Just like, oh, thank you.
[86:10.91]I appreciate a full slice.
[86:14.22]Cheese, like sauce cheese side down on the ground.
[86:17.96]This place would be a mess.
[86:25.47]You got bread side down.
[86:26.85]That's not a big deal.
[86:27.85]Cheese side down.
[86:28.59]That's a carpet clean.
[86:38.71]Uh-oh.
[86:53.16]Yes, cheese.
[86:53.90]I'm talking like with the cheese and sauce side down.
[86:56.75]Like if you dropped it on the ground.
[86:59.35]New tip.
[87:08.15]impossibly fast incredibly lethal and fearless are hands down the deadliest enemies within the matrix you can never completely kill an agent they'll just acquire another body that is plugged into the matrix at best you can temporarily defeat alright so it's like you just can't kill them I don't even where am I going
[87:40.37]Yeah, and you could not order a full pizza.
[87:42.33]It would just be a slice of cheese is what you could get.
[87:46.45]Am I missing something here?
[87:51.39]I'm... That probably looked on purpose and it kind of was, but I thought I could go... I don't know.
[87:55.28]I thought I could do Spider-Man on the wall.
[87:57.84]People are gonna be pissed.
[87:58.86]I'm sorry.
[87:59.52]People are gonna be pissed off now.
[88:01.00]Like, that's gonna make people angry.
[88:04.30]It's like, dude, just stop doing this.
[88:05.50]It's not fucking funny.
[88:06.58]I'm just trying to see what I can do in the game.
[88:15.54]What are you doing?
[88:22.15]So I need to go... Oh, there's a ladder right here.
[88:34.96]Okay.
[88:35.98]So now from... Where do I go from here?
[88:38.22]This way?
[88:38.52]Okay.
[88:55.50]Over there?
[89:14.54]Climb over the fence.
[89:15.58]You can jump a thousand feet in the air.
[89:39.64]Oh shit.
[89:52.23]What were you?
[89:52.61]Why were you two in here?
[89:54.39]What is in here?
[89:56.65]Why they were just sitting in here.
[89:58.19]There's nothing here.
[90:07.88]What?
[90:08.30]Is that just a big... Is that just like a... What is... What is... Uh-oh.
[90:25.81]Mr. Anderson.
[90:28.83]Mr. Anderson.
[90:58.51]Okay.
[91:00.03]So just don't, just don't fight them.
[91:06.48]Oh my god.
[91:07.48]Okay, this actually sucks.
[91:08.66]I'm just gonna run.
[91:10.64]This sucks.
[91:11.48]It's so far back.
[91:17.82]Who's surrounded us in seven minutes?
[91:29.07]How many people in the chat even understand what that was?
[91:34.90]Some of you do.
[91:37.58]Some of you.
[91:39.70]Not very many.
[91:47.97]That is Albert Wesker, but why did I say that?
[91:50.19]Trivia.
[91:52.55]Some channel trivia for people.
[92:01.66]Stop.
[92:08.61]Old video, dude.
[92:09.67]That's right.
[92:26.66]No!
[92:27.34]Oh my fucking god.
[92:28.70]You gotta be... I...
[92:34.45]Oh my god.
[92:35.15]I got caught on the lip and I didn't jump.
[92:39.19]I got stuck and the character went like that and I couldn't... Stop doing that.
[92:52.70]I'm sorry.
[92:54.62]I'm not doing it on purpose.
[92:55.82]I'm telling you.
[92:56.62]I'm promising you.
[93:00.34]I actually got... You think I would be at the very end like that and do that?
[93:02.88]No, I got caught...
[93:05.32]should change the game I'm kind of I kind of like this I'm giving this another 30 20 30 minutes I I get to uh I'm gonna have the streamer reverse veto where I'm I'm playing this like at least another 25 minutes at least this is I like this a lot this is very fun
[93:35.60]OK, come on, don't screw it up.
[93:47.87]OK.
[93:56.95]Now I have to sit here.
[93:58.67]The health to regen.
[94:10.31]Okay.
[94:15.45]What is this?
[94:15.99]A little shortcut?
[94:22.31]What is this?
[94:24.99]I didn't see this.
[94:30.85]Where do I go?
[94:31.63]Where do I go?
[94:35.86]I fucking freaked out.
[94:38.06]I freaked out.
[94:38.78]I'm gonna take the disk out.
[94:40.38]I thought I had to jump over there.
[94:42.04]I don't understand.
[94:43.54]I can't fight him.
[94:45.84]Oh, shit.
[94:46.60]I look so stupid.
[94:48.87]I look so dumb.
[94:52.41]Where do you go?
[94:54.29]It doesn't look like there's a... To the right?
[95:01.29]Don't jump to him.
[95:02.45]What?
[95:03.42]Where am I supposed to go?
[95:09.17]I need to go left.
[95:10.03]That's what I tried to do.
[95:13.35]You were at the right spot.
[95:14.44]I just missed the jump?
[95:24.24]This breakable wood?
[95:25.20]That's what I saw.
[95:27.20]And I was like, can I jump into that or through that?
[95:39.68]I almost didn't make that jump
[96:21.64]What?
[96:25.22]Stop!
[96:43.22]Oh shit!
[96:43.88]Is that him?
[97:24.71]Now where?
[97:26.39]Here.
[97:29.05]I pressed it, but it didn't jump and I made it.
[97:30.30]I'm fine.
[97:48.38]I'm out.
[97:50.68]Oh, we got a cutscene.
[97:52.90]Perfect.
[97:55.36]You OK?
[97:58.38]Man, reality can be a bitch.
[98:00.48]Tell me about it.
[98:02.50]You want a shot?
[98:03.54]Dr. Feelgood can fix you up.
[98:05.38]Right now, all I want to know is what's on that disk.
[98:11.50]Sir, we just received an emergency broadcast from the log house.
[98:15.32]She did it.
[98:16.04]Yes, sir.
[98:16.96]The last transmission of the Osiris.
[98:19.22]Who's that?
[98:19.98]Captain of the Osiris.
[98:21.44]It is 1803 on 1214, and I fear this will be our last transmission.
[98:25.70]Less than two hours ago, we were pinned between two search units near BC 218.
[98:30.18]We tried to outrun them on the surface when our sensors went completely berserk.
[98:33.78]We didn't believe what our equipment was telling us until we ran smack into the middle of it.
[98:38.80]An army.
[98:39.84]Their army.
[98:41.28]It's massive.
[98:42.76]Hundreds of times the size of anything we've fought.
[98:45.88]We're under heavy pursuit and have sustained critical damage.
[98:48.81]We're going to attempt an emergency broadcast in the matrix after that.
[98:53.91]Oh,
[98:56.96]If it does, it is not too late.
[98:59.55]Add an opportunity.
[99:02.81]Drop down in Zion broadcast.
[99:04.39]I want this data transmitted immediately.
[99:06.83]Emergency encryption.
[99:07.93]Are you saying I farted?
[99:09.71]Lieutenant.
[99:10.43]Yes, sir.
[99:11.39]Is the logo still in contact?
[99:13.27]Yes, sir.
[99:14.23]There's ants in your hair.
[99:15.14]Get me Captain Niobe.
[99:19.64]Live feed from Zion.
[99:21.88]Jesus, it's Deadbolt himself.
[99:23.72]Give me that.
[99:27.17]Captain, you and your crew to be commended.
[99:29.10]What you have done may prove to be the turning point in this war.
[99:31.90]Do you have a plan, Commander?
[99:33.14]Right now, I want every ship to return to Zion.
[99:36.00]Full protocol as fast as humanly possible.
[99:39.10]I leave the recall in your hands, Captain.
[99:41.03]Yes, sir, Commander.
[99:41.53]This is all on one disk, by the way.
[99:43.35]That's pretty remarkable.
[99:45.81]Please be careful.
[99:49.03]As careful as I can be.
[99:55.96]It's just one disk.
[99:56.92]It was a DVD.
[99:57.64]The power of the DVD.
[99:58.74]You know what's weird about the Xbox?
[100:03.57]When that first came out...
[100:35.08]You have reached the Daniel Institute of Dream Interpretation.
[100:37.84]Please record your message at the tone.
[100:39.74]I am calling to confirm that your order of red orchids will be delivered tomorrow by midnight.
[100:45.53]This is the Great Beyond Travel Agency.
[100:47.99]We will get back to you as soon as humanly possible.
[100:51.19]I am calling to confirm that your order of red orchids will be delivered tomorrow by midnight.
[100:57.41]Operator.
[100:58.07]Jax.
[100:58.57]Niobe, is that you?
[100:59.41]I'm not sure I can talk right now, Jax.
[101:01.33]Niobe, listen to me.
[101:02.55]They got Axel.
[101:04.01]Sorin let everybody in after him.
[101:05.63]It's bad, Niobe, real bad.
[101:07.13]Where?
[101:08.02]The airport.
[101:08.54]What?
[101:09.38]We're at the airport.
[101:10.38]Please, you gotta help us.
[101:12.06]Agents have cornered Sorin.
[101:13.14]They're moving Axel to the tarmac.
[101:15.20]If they get him in the air...
[101:20.71]I have no idea what just happened.
[101:53.50]Okay.
[101:55.60]Why did I?
[101:56.86]No, put this down.
[101:58.18]Can I?
[101:58.82]How can I?
[101:59.18]I'm just going to lie down and get scanned by the machine.
[102:19.10]I didn't even go through security.
[102:22.34]What?
[102:24.22]What?
[102:24.60]I don't... Oh shit, it's Agent Smith!
[102:35.81]What's going on?
[102:38.63]What?
[102:38.89]I just made it through.
[102:45.69]This isn't Hitman?
[102:46.97]You unlocked the cartwheel.
[102:48.27]This guy does not know where I am.
[102:57.66]What did he just drop?
[103:04.19]Ooh, how do I use that?
[103:05.07]Wait, how do I use the cartwheel?
[103:15.06]Hold down, hold down, focus, sidestep.
[103:16.66]Okay.
[103:17.38]So you have to have a gun.
[103:25.18]Why does this not work?
[103:53.91]I think I missed something here.
[103:56.12]This dude's flailing.
[103:57.18]I was told flailing is fine.
[103:58.68]Alright, I'm back.
[104:08.94]What?
[104:11.42]Why did that guy climb?
[104:13.56]He climbed on top.
[104:19.26]Okay.
[104:20.94]What do I do?
[104:40.85]This is supposed to be a stealth mission?
[104:42.45]Well, I... Like, the character picked up the weapon.
[104:46.33]I didn't want... No, look, I don't want this stuff.
[104:48.13]I didn't want to do that.
[104:48.75]Oh, shit.
[104:59.52]How do I use flashbangs?
[105:10.08]Circle strafe.
[105:16.24]These are strafe controls.
[105:17.94]How do I strafe?
[105:19.12]Oh.
[105:20.62]Hit strafe left and strafe right.
[105:23.34]That doesn't help at all.
[105:25.90]Hold target lock.
[105:26.90]Wait a minute.
[105:34.89]What's strafe?
[105:47.10]A strafe to strafe.
[105:57.43]This is not a cartwheel.
[105:59.35]Sorry, but it's not.
[106:05.23]I'm not dying in here.
[106:12.59]Come on.
[107:04.73]Okay, that's how you do it.
[107:09.75]I'm gonna die.
[107:11.03]Please don't do it.
[107:19.72]Where am I supposed to go?
[107:20.98]This is going to keep spawning on me until I find the right door to plug into or whatever.
[107:28.27]NVIDIA, the way it's meant to be played.
[107:37.79]Holy shit.
[107:39.99]It's linear, just go forward.
[107:41.15]Isn't that where I just was?
[107:42.67]Oh, I was not here.
[107:48.53]Alright, alright, alright.
[108:08.21]I just flashed that guy.
[108:10.13]The only one that got affected by it.
[108:13.29]He looked over here.
[108:16.07]Oh my god.
[108:17.47]I just want to...
[108:55.75]They can see pretty well right now.
[108:57.66]This is where you go.
[109:03.78]Everything's fine.
[109:04.84]This is... Everything's fine.
[109:33.94]You need to throw a grenade at the window.
[109:40.42]No, I don't.
[109:45.79]He didn't read.
[109:48.71]Use the grenade?
[109:50.57]An actual grenade.
[109:51.63]I don't even have grenades.
[109:54.98]Is there a different grenade button?
[109:58.18]That's a flashbang.
[109:59.18]Yeah, but I don't have actual grenades.
[110:06.47]Weapon select fire, secondary fire.
[110:08.55]First person kick, jump.
[110:12.25]I don't have any grenades.
[110:15.25]Shoot the glass.
[110:15.89]I don't think there is.
[110:21.80]Is there not?
[110:22.36]I don't know.
[110:24.84]Do you think it was...
[110:38.17]trapped.
[110:38.61]Try the big wall.
[110:41.78]Hold on.
[110:42.06]Let me just make sure.
[110:43.50]Nope.
[110:46.66]I didn't miss something over here?
[110:56.53]I don't get it.
[111:08.61]I think you need to use the Superman dive.
[111:22.80]Okay.
[111:28.50]Where does it want me to go?
[111:30.84]I think I might actually be softlocked.
[111:41.42]It's the white button.
[111:42.33]Yeah, I... The yellow... Is something yellow in the room?
[111:51.03]The yellow box?
[111:51.63]Yeah, I can't touch it.
[111:56.71]In the lockers?
[112:02.21]This actually might be bugged.
[112:10.31]Flashbangs might have softlocked the box.
[112:12.51]That's the grenade box.
[112:14.91]Oh, should I just refresh?
[112:19.67]Uh, I'll just refresh.
[112:21.55]How far away is the load, though?
[112:23.39]No, no, no, no, no.
[112:24.03]Just shoot it.
[112:26.17]Wall run?
[112:47.98]follow the arrow.
[112:48.89]I can't.
[112:52.39]You could probably blow your way out of there.
[112:55.85]Yeah?
[113:00.07]It's broken.
[113:00.66]I'm just gonna relax.
[113:04.50]It's... Okay, everything's fucked up.
[113:05.72]I'm just gonna... I'm scared that if I do this, though... Where am I gonna be?
[113:19.44]shoot the box it's not shoot the box it's not I I guarantee it's not shoot the box I guarantee it this is not that far back get out of here
[113:47.52]See?
[113:48.79]Okay, I just picked it up.
[114:21.57]Alright.
[114:22.97]So now... Flashbang.
[114:25.41]Why is it back?
[114:25.89]Use extreme caution.
[114:26.51]Gunshots in the area.
[114:46.83]You broke it again?
[114:51.39]How did I do that?
[115:06.66]You weren't softlocked.
[115:07.42]You didn't break it.
[115:13.30]Change to different... Hold on.
[115:18.44]What was that?
[115:20.38]Oh, I thought I shot a harpoon out of my chest.
[115:24.03]Alright, hold on.
[115:25.85]Do I have to do it again?
[115:26.99]Equip the grenade.
[115:34.55]I didn't know where to... It didn't tell me to do that ever.
[115:47.61]Okay, now where do I go?
[116:09.01]Ah dude, maximize your experience with Pentium 4!
[116:13.19]That- a lot of computer ads.
[116:35.84]What?
[116:38.06]No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[116:47.76]Stop!
[116:48.16]Am I right?
[117:07.58]Why did he go so fast?
[117:26.48]I thought the helicopter was inside of the building for a second.
[117:30.70]Like, there's no way.
[117:38.35]Okay.
[117:38.61]Why are you saying F?
[117:57.35]F?
[117:57.49]What?
[117:57.97]Small F?
[118:00.19]I don't see it on my end.
[118:05.89]The only option is to fight.
[118:11.96]I didn't have a second to understand what was going on.
[118:24.74]Maybe Twitch is having a problem?
[118:26.81]Okay, so don't.
[118:33.55]Fuck you!
[118:34.19]Fuck you!
[119:17.62]Whoa!
[119:31.08]Refresh my health.
[119:38.40]Why is the health not counting up?
[119:54.05]I can't.
[119:55.73]Fourth wall break when he looked over his shoulder like, whoa, man, this is crazy.
[120:03.84]The music is fucking me up too.
[120:05.24]It's just like... The disk is skipping.
[120:07.42]How do you do this without... Where is the...
[120:58.39]What are you talking about?
[121:03.49]Oh my god!
[121:23.33]I'm so dead!
[121:27.39]oh my goodness this is this is ridiculous what's the way to actually go about doing this just use grenades on the helicopter I don't think that's gonna work
[122:02.62]Oh.
[123:03.17]Why would you do that?
[123:13.94]The helicopter's cycle is so weird.
[123:17.04]Like, where is it?
[123:27.58]What are you supposed to do about that?
[123:33.95]Dodge the bullets?
[123:35.81]Okay.
[123:36.73]Excuse me.
[123:38.72]Just dodge the bullets.
[123:42.24]That ain't gonna happen.
[124:21.74]Where's the helicopter?
[124:28.85]Goes around and goes brrrrrr.
[124:33.00]Okay then wait for it to turn around - and back up.
[124:44.00]Goddamnit, I thought they were spawning.
[125:04.50]That was a good cycle.
[125:06.86]Wait for the machine gun fire to go off the rock.
[125:14.50]Yep.
[125:14.92]Yep.
[125:15.50]Okay.
[125:16.10]Okay.
[125:16.56]Okay.
[125:16.94]Okay.
[125:17.24]Go.
[125:24.02]Maybe one more cycle.
[125:31.81]Get off my screen!
[126:05.56]Yeah!
[126:06.18]What does it want me to do?
[126:41.06]Check the area for useful gear.
[126:42.39]What does it want me to... I don't get it.
[127:11.61]Thank you.
[127:46.05]I have to get it.
[127:46.97]I can't leave without it.
[128:01.24]Is there a crouch?
[128:31.33]I don't know what he wants me to do.
[128:36.54]Hey dude, have you ever heard of UpDog?
[128:40.32]What is that thing you just said, UpDog?
[128:55.10]I don't know why it wants me to do this.
[129:06.27]Good.
[129:06.43]I think it was just broken.
[129:08.83]I'm having a good time, but it might be time to move on to... I don't know.
[129:15.03]Moving on sounds like a bad idea.
[129:17.63]Hold on.
[129:21.32]not yet another can't get past that gate the other walkway I don't know where I'm going
[130:22.37]How did you guys get over here?
[130:26.65]This wasn't open.
[130:28.68]That was not just open 15 seconds ago.
[130:53.83]I was gonna say, I almost like pogged too hard there and went out the window.
[131:21.87]Nice.
[131:27.91]Lower the resolution of the facecam.
[131:29.76]No, it'll break.
[131:32.18]I have it set perfectly right now.
[131:34.12]I don't want to fix it again.
[131:34.94]The piano will help you reach the roof.
[131:36.28]There's a piano.
[132:19.61]I love this music.
[132:22.08]Butter!
[132:22.78]I almost made it.
[133:06.39]Grab it!
[133:31.06]Wait on the piano.
[133:41.91]Wait for the piano.
[133:48.45]Aim, you idiot.
[133:52.45]Where's the piano?
[134:28.56]Why is he looking for a piano in the ceiling?
[134:30.59]I'm not, I'm... Where's this piano?
[134:36.99]Wait for the piano.
[134:42.85]Oh, fuck that.
[134:52.54]Where's the piano?
[134:54.10]I'm being loud.
[135:06.65]Oh, my God.
[135:07.49]Okay.
[135:07.87]I don't know what it was.
[135:08.97]Guys, this is a... I got it.
[135:25.61]I'll go pee.
[135:27.75]We lost some time in there.
[135:28.70]Where are they now?
[135:29.72]Soren and his men have been cornered.
[135:31.56]AT-28 in the annex.
[135:32.68]How's Niobe doing?
[135:33.66]She's not dead yet.
[135:36.96]Okay, I gotta pee.
[135:37.78]I'll be right back.
[138:37.69]I forgot about the burn-in, but something else that's very interesting.
[138:41.91]So I had this computer.
[138:44.23]This room gets really, really hot because this computer.
[138:47.75]And, you know, it's just streaming and encoding and things pretty much just cooking over here.
[138:55.19]The original Xbox is almost, I think, generating more heat than that computer.
[139:01.97]I went from just out of this room to back in here and it was at least 10 to 20% hotter in here than it's ever been.
[139:11.67]It's like a sauna in this room.
[139:15.92]This is ridiculous.
[139:25.02]Did you play Halo?
[139:27.00]I actually, I thought about it.
[139:28.60]Maybe one of these days.
[139:30.94]Alright, so I'm not leaving yet, but I do want to give you a couple of options here.
[139:40.49]It's not over yet.
[139:43.81]I want to pull in the chat.
[139:44.71]I'm going to give you three options to pivot from here.
[139:48.11]The first option is Cold Fear.
[139:55.72]The second option is Star Wars Obi-Wan.
[140:04.23]And the third option is Legends of Wrestling.
[140:10.47]That's a tough one.
[140:12.05]That's a very tough one.
[140:19.32]Is there a fourth option?
[140:20.52]Go Offline.
[140:24.16]It's a little too early for that.
[140:25.48]Okay, coming back.
[140:34.75]Oh, let's see.
[140:35.33]What do you guys want?
[140:38.91]It's still pretty early in the poll.
[140:45.43]Are you ever going to return to a dead of night?
[140:47.08]No, never.
[140:49.12]Never.
[140:51.32]That's just not going to happen.
[141:01.09]I couldn't do it.
[141:01.53]Alright, unless the Obi-Wan fans can really pull this through, Legends of Wrestling looks like it's going to be what we're doing.
[141:12.81]It's really not even close.
[141:14.41]Go ahead and close it.
[141:15.86]Legends of Wrestling is up next.
[141:20.54]Okay, let's go.
[141:23.36]I'll play this for another 15 minutes.
[141:36.02]That was the lamest action movie jump I've ever seen.
[141:49.76]So loud.
[141:53.04]Is it?
[141:56.30]Oh, I didn't turn off the music.
[141:57.44]Alright, does anybody else get like this when there's an escalator?
[142:05.86]And there's nobody in front of you.
[142:08.70]Just go.
[142:09.66]Hurry up.
[142:10.16]Right?
[142:15.70]Sometimes I just sit there, though.
[142:20.31]Sometimes I'm just like, you know what?
[142:21.17]I don't even care.
[142:21.69]I'm going to let the machine just do it for me.
[142:30.59]How are you not afraid of escalators?
[142:34.44]Um...
[142:36.51]Because to me, in my brain, an escalator is an incredibly basic contraption.
[142:41.71]All an escalator is, is just a thing, it's just a tread that moves in a circle.
[142:46.80]There's nothing really that mechanically ridiculous or strange about an escalator.
[142:53.16]It's a very basic concept.
[142:56.68]It's the stuff that has the complicated shit in the middle that freaks me out.
[143:03.09]By the way, where am I going here?
[143:17.02]Shoot.
[143:19.04]What did I just?
[143:19.56]Did I just command bullets to fly?
[143:26.32]It's still open.
[143:27.13]Now's your chance.
[143:27.79]Don't move.
[143:28.79]So open it.
[143:45.25]Oops!
[143:51.03]For a second I thought he was talking.
[143:52.13]I thought that was the person in my ear.
[143:55.50]Escalator up to the second floor.
[143:59.86]Technology.
[144:14.04]I didn't miss every single one of those.
[144:15.50]No, my goodness, I'm going to die.
[144:42.18]Not if I hide over here escalator.
[145:10.85]What?
[145:13.09]Why can I not take the escalator?
[145:14.21]Take the stairs?
[145:32.00]It said take the escalator, didn't it?
[145:33.36]Does something have to do with it?
[145:40.02]No, what?
[145:40.30]Anyone want to help me?
[145:54.25]It's a different one?
[146:00.37]The game is chugging so hard right now.
[146:03.95]Okay.
[146:06.15]It's a different escalator.
[146:07.35]Oh, alright.
[146:28.51]There we- Whoa!
[146:35.49]Where did it go?
[146:40.05]What?
[146:40.35]It went into the escalator.
[146:50.18]There's a door leading there at the end of this hall, right here.
[147:32.65]Over the railing.
[147:33.27]Over the railing.
[147:33.87]Over the railing.
[147:34.47]Come on.
[147:34.87]Oh, and I didn't even do it in slow motion.
[147:36.57]I'm pissed.
[147:37.09]Oh.
[147:58.56]Don't die here.
[147:59.10]Hold on.
[147:59.66]Hide.
[148:05.11]Next!
[148:05.75]With a bunch of exclamation points.
[148:07.15]Relax!
[148:14.87]Okay, he came... He's behind me?
[148:16.95]Where?
[148:18.65]What?
[148:25.58]That was a cardboard cutout.

[149:04.05]Can't give him a car?
[149:05.51]Like a golf cart?
[149:06.55]They have to run?
[149:07.27]Provide sniper cover.
[149:33.90]That was so, like, such a... I thought we were on the same team.
[149:38.82]That was so overdone, too.
[149:40.35]Like, I just... I'm on edge right now.
[149:42.21]Why?
[149:42.53]I... My brain.
[149:46.79]It was... I thought they were talking to... Why am I in this room?
[149:49.07]And why is everybody looking... Honestly, that... Please.
[149:51.93]I need to relax.
[149:54.51]I need to calm down.
[149:57.77]Okay.
[149:59.29]That was so completely overdone.
[150:04.12]In my brain, it was like, there's not a single reason ever.
[150:08.36]Like, I thought we were on the same team for a second.
[150:13.30]It was like, oh, get the sniper rifle and support.
[150:17.93]And they were talking.
[150:18.85]Why am I even in the room?
[150:20.25]Is what I'm trying to say.
[150:33.07]How do you- how do you zoom in?
[150:46.99]Was that my teammate?
[150:47.99]I don't know!
[150:52.94]Was that the guy I'm supposed to protect?
[150:57.16]Fuck!
[150:57.90]I think that was- I think that was a good guy.
[151:08.76]in the cutscene.
[151:13.80]I'm so stupid.
[151:21.24]I don't know.
[151:21.68]It's just like, this is just a trailing short-term memory where it just ends.
[151:27.09]There's a period where I'll remember anything, but it just ends here and it just moves along on a track and it's just everything that's back behind here is gone.
[151:38.91]short-term memory I can't believe I did that what is your field of fire I've got the runway how about the hangar people are talking and it's like look help we were all talking about helping each other I've got a clear shot confirm take the shot sure thing they're on the tower
[152:10.59]Cover the stairs below the roof.
[152:12.09]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[152:22.08]No!
[152:22.46]That's somebody else on the team.
[152:24.16]That's somebody else.
[152:25.36]Where do you want me to fight?
[152:26.28]What the hell are you...
[152:35.47]What?! !
[153:12.69]Cover the stairs below the roof.
[153:23.49]Why can you even walk forward?
[153:27.53]Why can you walk forward there?
[153:33.26]I have a blindfold on.
[153:34.26]I have to throw this guy out.
[154:00.77]Okay, so where, what do I have to do on the lower staircase?
[154:10.12]Shit.
[154:13.36]Down here.
[154:13.94]These motherfuckers right here?
[154:32.44]Get to the balcony downstairs and help.
[154:36.25]Okay.
[155:07.30]Come on!
[155:07.90]There's no way that kills you.
[155:09.82]There's no way that kills you.
[155:12.17]How far down do we have to go?
[155:13.73]Time's up?
[155:17.07]No, it's not up.
[155:21.85]Who are you talking to still?
[156:00.83]It's- this is such a weird angle too.
[156:09.19]What do you mean I passed it?
[156:29.16]Come on, this is a fool me once scenario.
[156:31.06]There's always just a dead end five feet in front of these doors.
[156:48.92]No?
[156:55.21]Back to the top of the tower?
[156:59.86]Are you serious?
[157:00.90]I just... Okay, we're good.
[157:15.07]Alright.
[157:16.11]In exactly five minutes, I'm moving on.
[157:18.13]I promise.
[157:26.30]They shot the cover off the front tire.
[157:28.30]Take the tire out.
[157:29.68]Of the plane or the car?
[157:54.76]I don't think that's how that would work.
[157:56.51]But, you know, whatever.
[158:00.85]Where are they?
[158:53.07]You're trapped.
[158:53.65]You have to take out that copter.
[158:59.95]With a sniper rifle?
[159:07.15]Okay.
[159:09.71]Um... That's just... It was like a little animal.
[159:28.32]Give me a chance.
[159:40.61]2.5 minutes left?
[159:41.11]Yeah!
[159:41.43]I have to do that again.
[159:44.17]Uh-oh.
[159:48.09]I hope I can do this twice.
[159:51.49]This game is awesome, though.
[159:52.81]I might just come back and play this another, like, later.
[160:08.24]Okay, alright, get out, get out, get out.
[160:12.08]Where is the... Where is it?
[160:12.88]Right in front of me?
[160:36.95]Okay.
[160:43.57]Whoa!
[161:41.93]Is he alive?
[161:43.13]Was he dead?
[161:43.65]Is he alive?
[161:44.21]I don't know if he's... Is he dead?
[161:49.47]That was unfair.
[161:50.59]That was actually unfair.
[161:52.34]I thought he was still alive.
[161:57.10]I thought he was going to shoot me like three or four more times.
[161:59.30]Time's up.
[162:02.76]546 is the prediction.
[162:04.88]Okay.
[162:08.82]I had that too.
[162:10.58]That was annoying.
[162:15.82]You have 15 seconds?
[162:16.60]546.
[162:16.96]That's what the mods have told me.
[162:30.01]I wonder.
[162:43.46]Oh, yeah!
[162:44.84]Alright, I got it right here.
[162:48.30]You just gotta go right in.
[162:52.63]What?
[162:53.01]Get the help.
[162:55.23]What?
[163:01.79]Who just did that?
[163:05.45]What just happened?
[163:13.83]Did I skip a cutscene?
[163:16.37]There was no way to go down.
[163:17.51]Did I skip the cutscene?
[163:19.94]I heard...
[163:29.81]Hurry up!
[163:31.46]I'll get it right now.
[163:32.40]I got the strategy.
[163:35.02]Door opened.
[163:36.76]You didn't even look.
[163:37.44]Yeah, I did.
[163:39.14]But I didn't know I had literally five seconds to move.
[163:44.13]It just was like, oh, get the heck out of there.
[163:45.69]Okay, get the heck out of there.
[163:46.65]You know how many times we've heard get out of there in this game in the last two and a half hours?
[163:59.30]you host
[164:24.88]Okay, I was gonna say there's not a single chance that would happen.
[164:31.67]Soren, did you get Axel?
[164:33.43]No.
[164:34.29]At last word, he's on another transport plane.
[164:37.03]My team's trying to locate him.
[164:39.19]I can't believe I shot this guy in the head.
[164:45.48]We'll need a car.
[164:48.92]Wait, what?
[164:52.20]Let's go.
[164:52.62]Weren't we just going down?
[164:53.68]Why are we back up?
[164:54.74]I thought the whole point was to get out of here.
[165:03.65]Is this a faux letter grade?
[165:04.49]Because if it is, I am not leaving. ...
[165:27.94]That person's dead!
[165:29.54]That person is dead!
[165:51.29]I thought that was supposed to be exactly five more minutes.
[165:53.33]It is.
[165:55.03]But if I get to actually drive the car, I get to add a... Nope.
[165:58.83]I don't care.
[165:59.55]You want me to leave now?
[166:01.41]No way.
[166:40.76]Drive!
[166:41.26]The car!
[166:42.16]Drive!
[166:42.76]I love the way he's driving too.
[166:54.89]He's like... This is a great game.
[167:07.64]I love this game.
[167:11.54]It gets it.
[167:11.98]I know it's like an old lady Is there a horn?
[168:02.13]What are they dropping?
[168:27.91]Someone fell out of the plane?
[168:31.29]Who fell out of the plane?
[169:01.67]What is this?
[169:06.59]What is happening?
[169:12.51]Did they fall out of the plane?
[169:40.00]What am I supposed to be doing?
[169:43.36]I don't understand.
[169:50.98]Go up the ramp?
[169:56.12]This car is smoking.
[169:58.89]There's a ramp?

[171:33.46]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[171:38.38]Pay attention.
[171:46.85]Someone's falling out of the plane.
[171:52.71]Okay.
[171:53.11]Pick him up when he lands.
[171:55.33]Don't lose him.
[171:59.52]I didn't see anybody fall out of the plane.
[172:30.76]I didn't even see it.
[172:31.72]I accidentally just did that.
[172:33.47]How did you even see that was here?
[172:34.99]How did you know that was here?
[173:02.56]My car can't even fit through this fucking hole!
[173:06.44]Am I going the right way?

[174:45.36]This car is... I can't have control.
[175:19.87]I can't see because of the smoke.
[175:22.07]Am I going?
[175:26.63]He's getting away with the hacksaw.
[175:47.39]Which way?
[175:54.78]Did I accidentally pick the right door?
[175:58.91]Oh my god.
[175:59.53]That was unbelievable.
[176:00.43]That was ridiculous.
[176:02.21]That was so hard.
[176:06.59]I loved it though.
[176:16.71]Pretty good wall run by that car.
[176:38.83]Hold on.
[176:41.70]Wait.

[177:33.29]Let's just watch this last DMCA cutscene and we'll figure it out.
[177:38.70]Alright, Axel.
[177:40.40]That's your dust off.
[177:41.90]I think we're alright.
[177:42.78]I'll move on.
[177:43.30]I wouldn't have done what you did.
[177:44.64]I thank you for it.
[177:46.76]It depends on how interesting the next mission starts.
[177:48.98]You know what I mean?
[177:51.44]I'm just glad fate brought you to the airport.
[177:53.66]I'm not sure you'll agree with that tomorrow.
[177:56.16]Just tell Soren Midnight.
[177:57.82]He'll know the place.
[178:10.96]He is fast.
[178:11.98]I will say that.
[178:12.58]Come back to this game?
[178:25.47]72 hours.
[178:29.95]72 hours.
[178:31.74]What did you just say?
[178:32.66]That's exactly how long Zion lasted last time.
[178:38.12]What do you mean and who are you?
[178:42.76]I thought that was Adam Sandler for one second.
[178:57.05]I don't know why.
[179:01.69]Actually, how?
[179:02.50]I don't know.
[179:02.96]It was like 72 hours.
[179:09.07]This is a 72 hour.
[179:11.80]Right?
[179:25.71]That was a bad imitation.
[179:26.75]No, it wasn't.
[179:28.01]That was fine.
[179:37.43]no wrestling no I'm waiting just wait has everyone arrived that sounded like Yoda figures anything for an entrance captains
[180:02.27]Captain Niobe, my crew and I appreciate what you did for us.
[180:05.43]It's not illegal if it's on a video game disk.
[180:07.01]He's alive.
[180:08.11]Happy to be alive.
[180:09.33]Let's get going because you know Morpheus is not going to show until after we get started.
[180:13.20]I agree.
[180:13.66]I don't like us all being in the same place for too long.
[180:16.14]Why don't you tell us what this is all about, Niobe?
[180:19.20]The machines are digging.
[180:24.41]Tell that to the judge.
[180:53.52]it's the fence get to your exits you know they could just cut the pipes up there so nobody has to duck anymore just get some pipe these cutters and just cut the top people you've clearly cut them already they're perfectly cut straight across go up by one two feet
[181:20.02]Alright, here we go.
[181:21.66]Is this beginning of this mission interesting enough for me to keep playing?
[181:25.56]Let's find out.
[181:26.16]I'm telling you, if he hops on a motorcycle, I ain't going anywhere.
[181:36.01]Alright, that was pretty funny.
[181:41.34]I might have to stay.
[182:01.51]So Legends of Wrestling is coming up next.
[182:04.67]Seems like a fun thing to do.
[182:07.71]Seems like an interesting game to play.
[182:10.33]That was the Matrix.
[182:11.35]Enter the Matrix.
[182:11.91]We're going to move on.
[182:15.29]Let me just make sure I don't burn the screen in with the next thing.
[182:23.42]I don't really want to climb up all that right now.
[182:33.37]Alright.
[182:33.87]Legends of Wrestling.
[182:34.89]Where are you?
[182:39.84]There you are.
[182:45.72]Did he beat it?
[182:46.38]No, I didn't.
[182:48.40]I did not beat it.
[182:52.30]Will you go back to the Matrix?
[182:55.08]Um... I mean, that was really fun.
[182:59.00]Maybe.
[182:59.46]I don't know.
[183:00.20]We gave it a solid three hours.
[183:02.16]That's...
[183:03.74]That was double overtime.
[183:09.62]That was a double overtime.
[183:16.20]Usually it's about 40 minutes to an hour for each one of these.
[183:20.10]That was double, triple overtime almost.
[183:27.86]Okay, here we go.
[183:33.21]on can you see uh great disk loading action yeah I never thought this could be me I guess you never do until it's happening to you

[184:34.64]Everyone is so hyped for me to play this.
[184:37.06]But I don't know.
[184:37.82]I feel like this is maybe... Wait.
[184:41.86]I don't know.
[184:42.28]I'm not going to pretend to know.
[184:44.59]Because this could just be kind of not that fun.
[184:50.35]I don't know.
[184:52.27]This game is legitimately not that good.
[184:54.69]That's what somebody just said.
[184:55.95]Okay.
[185:00.47]Okay.
[185:06.60]Hold on.

[191:22.22]The, you couldn't even stand on these.
[191:23.84]This is okay.

[192:34.93]That doesn't look right.
[192:35.69]Please mute the sound.
[192:37.47]There, it's not as bad.
[193:26.10]I don't know.
[193:26.56]No, it's definitely tiny.
[193:28.62]I kind of want to take the mask off and have it just have this.

[195:26.70]Oh, I don't know.
[195:27.96]He's coming.
[195:38.81]Okay.
[195:39.93]You should come up with that.
[195:44.61]This guy sucks.
[196:00.96]Okay, you know what this looks like to me?
[196:02.34]This looks like an AI-generated person.
[196:09.43]It's like, oh, a man with a hat on, holding a scepter, has big legs and is very muscular.
[196:16.53]It's like, this is what it makes.

[197:29.68]High risk or cheating?
[197:30.78]What's better?
[197:34.76]Definitely cheating.

[199:15.34]Music.

[199:31.96]This is not Hulk Hogan's music.
[199:35.26]This is not even close.
[199:37.74]What is this?
[199:44.49]Are these all just DMCA versions?
[199:53.77]Yeah, they're all royalty free versions.
[199:57.82]They're not even close.
[200:15.91]I know, I know Bret Hart's music.
[200:24.89]No.
[200:26.27]It really is royalty-free versions.
[200:30.30]Why would they have the rights to the wrestlers but not their entrance music?
[200:41.54]Somebody said these are iCarly beats?
[200:46.20]iCarly beats... It's this Noah you're gonna convince me it's not this one.
[201:14.38]This one is so dumb.
[201:17.70]This is Jerry Lawler's music.
[201:20.20]But not... It's... This is the... Okay.
[201:22.16]These are the dream versions of this music.
[201:26.89]Like, that was... That was what was playing, but that's not what was playing in the dream.
[201:51.19]Hi, Carly.
[202:19.53]These are all so good.
[202:20.62]I don't know.
[202:24.36]Wait, hold on.
[202:24.97]We have to do the drop on this one.
[203:12.38]This is just the intro to Monster Rancher.
[203:19.58]Oh no, it's not.
[203:21.82]It's that song.
[203:29.73]I think I have to go.
[203:30.61]Look at how many there is.
[203:36.01]I think I have my choice already.
[203:37.91]This one has lyrics.
[203:48.04]This is Persona music.
[203:51.68]This plays in Persona.
[203:52.64]This is like Persona 5.
[204:19.24]I don't know.
[204:20.48]Our character eats bugs.
[204:22.00]I don't think this is... No.
[204:38.58]We're at a joint that's been cooking up burgers since 1950.
[204:41.08]Off on the corner of 1st and 2nd Street, there's Hank.
[204:53.30]The atmosphere, I love the food here.
[204:55.02]It's just so good.
[204:56.62]And we're going to talk about his homemade meatballs.
[205:01.32]Hold on a minute.
[205:01.80]Hold on, I have to...
[205:06.19]What is this here, man?
[205:07.51]There it is.
[205:08.21]Let me take a bite.
[205:15.90]See the onions.
[205:17.14]When they really get in there.
[205:18.84]And you got the thyme.
[205:20.04]You got the cumin in there, too.
[205:21.06]You're knocked out of the park, man.
[205:22.86]Out of the park.
[205:24.22]Killed it.
[205:43.49]This person doesn't have music.
[205:46.64]Oh, yeah they do.
[206:13.63]I don't want to do any more reality TV shit, but I'm gonna.
[206:19.26]Now, when you, you don't come back here and tell me how to run the store.
[206:24.24]Whenever you run a store and somebody comes up with an item that just looks like it's worth a thousand dollars, but it could be worth millions.
[206:29.55]This guy, this guy came in with a sword.
[206:34.00]I don't want you buying that sword, you fucking idiot.
[206:37.56]And Chumlee, Chumlee, go get us lunch.
[206:42.43]It's 1230.
[206:42.83]Wait, there's the same song.
[206:51.85]Dude, storage wars, storage wars.
[206:57.82]Every so often, somebody comes in with an item.
[206:59.52]That floors everybody.
[207:00.82]Wows everybody, you know?
[207:13.66]Wait, I say 1-0.
[207:16.51]I'm just having fun listening to these songs.
[207:21.80]This is more fun than the game.
[207:44.40]This one, I like this one, but... I just want to hear the fucking take a bite out of the food diners drive-ins dive song one more time.
[208:06.28]It's... I think it actually might be the song.
[208:09.86]I think this is the song.
[208:12.08]Right?
[208:13.87]Just make it this one.
[208:18.05]This is the song that plays.
[208:19.74]I think it's the royalty... I'm... Hold on.
[208:36.79]This one, it kind of has to be this one.
[208:39.14]Because if I get hit in the chair and get injured... If I get hit in the face of the chair in the first match...
[209:05.70]Fuck.
[209:06.24]Okay, fine.
[209:07.14]I gotta pee again.
[209:11.87]Let me pee one more time.

[239:28.05]How do I turn?
[239:28.80]Hey.
[240:04.79]wait tag tagging tagging oh shit
[240:40.10]Where is it?
[240:40.96]Uh-oh.
[240:46.66]Ah!
[240:50.90]Pick the weapon up!
[241:12.40]What?
[241:25.34]Oh, I blocked it.
[241:38.75]Tag.
[241:40.33]Tag, you idiot.
[242:13.07]Pin!
[242:13.41]Pin!
[242:13.95]Pin him!
[242:16.27]Pin him!
[242:23.55]No, shit!
[242:26.57]Tag in.
[242:35.34]Alright, tag in.
[242:51.37]He punched his own friend.
[242:53.45]Why can I hit two of them together?
[242:55.82]Why is the rep out?
[243:08.59]Alright, pin!
[243:17.69]Turn around and look at this guy.
[243:20.51]Stop looking at the other guy and look at the guy fighting in the ring.
[243:23.53]Oh.
[243:36.58]Oh shit.
[243:42.54]Get him, get him, get him.
[243:46.24]Oh my god, that's a dangerous move!
[243:54.71]Alright, get in here!
[243:55.65]And I need to get- I need to pin you.
[243:58.81]His body is lifeless.
[244:15.99]My god.
[244:19.95]Okay, pin.
[244:21.53]What's the pin button?
[244:29.75]Yeah, I could use your help right now.
[244:35.01]No, just take your time.
[244:35.93]Don't worry.
[244:36.29]I got both.
[244:47.56]I pressed every single button.
[244:58.61]What's he doing?
[245:05.01]Hit!
[245:10.17]Oh my god, that was a centimeter.
[245:46.86]No excitement, Andy.
[246:16.75]I tried to tag the partner and it didn't work.
[246:18.87]You're going for a no pin run.
[246:26.75]I mean, I'm going for a maybe one more match before we move on.
[246:30.60]This is, this is too much for my brain right now.
[246:37.92]It's D pad plus X. There's a QTE on the health bar to cheat.
[247:05.41]Wait, what'd I do?
[247:07.41]Oh, it's the Iron Sheik.
[247:08.57]Okay.
[247:08.99]Why am I against two people?
[247:38.07]Oh wait, I get it.
[247:53.58]I see what you mean.
[247:54.38]I have to time it.
[248:00.90]I get it.
[248:15.40]How do I do a finishing move?
[248:31.73]How is this not exciting?
[248:53.10]That's never not gonna be funny.
[249:16.78]That was sick!
[249:37.78]You need to cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat.
[249:39.54]What?
[249:51.22]Of course, I bring out the weapon and all of a sudden everybody thinks the match is cool again.
[249:59.28]Look at that.
[249:59.68]I brought out the weapon.
[250:01.76]I got 30% excitement meter.
[250:03.36]Dude, you should hit the ref.
[250:06.42]I think I did accidentally.
[250:20.57]Huge powerbomb.
[250:21.49]Oh, hold on.
[250:26.26]Grab him.
[250:35.29]Him!
[250:37.81]Stop winning.
[250:54.04]You don't get up immediately from that shit.
[250:55.80]Come on, dude.
[250:57.77]Uh-oh.
[251:12.53]Stop reversing that.
[251:13.83]Why did I just cut to that guy?
[251:24.74]Alright, he's got a weapon.
[251:25.66]Okay.
[251:42.01]You like that, Dodge?
[251:49.57]Reverse it!
[251:49.85]Hit him!
[251:55.80]Alright.
[252:06.69]Get him!
[252:12.46]How are you doing a one count after a move like that?
[252:21.96]Shit!
[252:22.14]It's gotta be it.
[252:41.17]Why are you doing it like that every time?
[252:45.94]Just pin him regular.
[252:47.14]Pin him normally.
[253:01.13]What is going on right now?
[253:02.33]Look at his health.
[253:05.61]I've had enough.
[253:36.91]It's stupid
[253:40.62]The ref is speaking Simlish.
[253:43.14]Oh no.
[253:47.30]He had to flex.
[254:10.42]Reverse.
[254:14.61]Fuck.
[254:42.51]I can't pin him.
[254:51.38]There's no... I need to win one by a pin.
[255:05.13]He has zero health.
[255:12.49]I just have to knock everybody out.
[255:17.74]Oh my god.
[255:23.18]That was a big excitement match.
[255:30.76]Alright, I'm moving on.
[255:31.52]This was too much.
[255:33.60]That was a great one, though.
[255:34.98]Two back-to-back great ones in a row.
[255:37.98]Although, I do want to see one thing, though.
[255:43.06]I want to see something.
[255:45.64]Okay, versus four-way tag team arena arena.
[255:49.59]I'm just checking to see if there's any other game modes, right?
[255:55.55]Like four-way dance.
[256:03.22]Yeah, I think that's it.
[256:07.78]Very limited.
[256:09.68]There's no Royal Rumble.
[256:12.07]Alright.
[256:12.81]It's time for you to vote.
[256:14.35]Are we playing Obi-Wan or Coldfear?
[256:23.63]Get a vote.
[256:24.55]Obi-Wan or Coldfear?
[256:31.40]Please vote.
[256:35.27]We've been sticking on the Xbox games a little longer.
[256:37.65]There's been some quality stuff here.
[256:40.17]It's going to be close.
[256:46.12]Ooh.
[256:47.96]It's 43 to 57.
[256:49.42]I'm going to have to wait for a second.
[256:58.10]Star Wars fans are losing out here, I think.
[257:05.60]Cold Fear, I think, is running away with it.
[257:12.72]Somebody said, Obi-Wan is ha-ha funny.
[257:16.30]Cold Fear is a horror game.
[257:18.18]Well, do you want a ha-ha funny Star Wars game or do you want a horror game?
[257:22.50]It's up to you.
[257:28.89]Looks like it's going to be Cold Fear.
[257:37.22]Okay.
[257:37.92]No, that's it.
[257:38.66]That was close, but that's it.
[257:39.94]45 to 55.
[257:41.82]Close.
[257:41.94]Let's do it.
[257:55.11]This game's on PC, isn't it?
[257:58.89]One of those games that... I think it's on PC, but...
[258:05.81]Doesn't really work.
[258:07.18]I feel like I tried to play this on PC.
[258:08.80]Maybe not.
[258:09.70]Did I?
[258:10.02]Did I play this before?
[258:14.90]Lights off.
[258:16.90]Okay.
[258:20.90]Okay.
[258:22.79]I'll do it.
[258:39.36]That... Just auto exposure.
[258:42.57]It got brighter.
[258:46.93]Hold on.
[259:02.32]How did it get brighter?
[259:09.82]Hold on a second.
[259:10.54]It's because I have auto exposure on.
[259:28.85]There we go.
[259:29.87]That's better.
[259:30.37]That's what it actually looks like in here.
[259:38.76]Is this actually scary?
[259:41.87]Or are you just memeing on me?
[259:48.98]Alright, let's go.
[260:01.25]Extreme to be what?
[260:02.49]Alright, be quiet.
[260:35.89]How do you look like you're in a part of Mexico in a Netflix series?
[260:58.53]You can see how, like, sweaty my face is.
[261:11.14]Come in.
[261:11.84]Come in.
[261:12.72]Damn it, Hernandez.
[261:13.66]Talk to me.
[261:15.04]What's going on?
[261:16.00]I'm not getting anything here.
[261:18.20]Marcus.
[261:19.11]Law.
[261:36.21]Does it have tank controls?
[261:37.03]Is this a tank control game?
[261:39.89]I'm taking it out of this.
[261:40.69]Yes, of course it has tank controls.
[261:41.78]Are you serious?
[261:42.42]Is this a granny like?
[261:42.92]I don't think it's a granny like.
[261:58.02]It's tank controls.
[261:59.93]God damn it.
[262:00.57]It's a survival horror game between 1992 and 2003.
[262:04.75]Of course, what am I thinking?
[262:07.99]Of course, it's going to be a tank control game.
[262:09.97]Am I out of my mind?
[262:14.58]Okay, people.
[262:15.50]You know your assignments.
[262:16.96]Hanson, you've got main deck port side.
[262:19.32]Watch yourself.
[262:20.22]You're going solo.
[262:21.48]How come Hanson gets all the fun?
[262:24.20]Because he's prettier than you are, DeSantos.
[262:26.78]Cut the chatter.
[262:28.20]This place is creeping me out.
[262:30.67]Where is everyone?
[262:31.69]Steady, Freedman.
[262:33.17]Remember, I've got that extraction code in case things get hairy.
[262:36.67]Forty-Forty, this is the Ravenswood.
[262:38.21]The seas are too rough.
[262:39.29]We're gonna have to head back.
[262:43.79]Not tank controls, by the way.
[262:46.28]Not tank controls.
[262:50.18]Already much cooler.
[262:55.63]Live ammo turning is now suspended, meaning combat situation is better than it also is.
[262:58.63]Look at their downed armor-resistant sources of ammo and medkits.
[263:03.28]If you use the butt of your rifle in close combat situations, it will enable you to gain the necessary distance to adjust your aim.
[263:08.72]If your opponents will attempt to immobilize you, do not simply empty your foot.
[263:11.60]Try to get out of them before yourself and shoot at point-blank ranges to generate higher effect.
[263:15.80]Okay.
[263:18.14]Alright.
[263:19.84]Okay.
[263:23.22]Legends of wrestling has burnt into the top of the screen and it's ruining my immersion.
[263:30.83]I'm falling back!
[263:31.59]Reform on my position!
[263:33.81]I repeat, reform here!
[263:37.12]Lieutenant Lansing, come in, come in!
[263:52.42]How do I run?
[263:53.00]This is actually kind of cool.
[264:02.60]Whoa.
[264:08.81]This is not hand controls.
[264:10.69]This actually seems like it's going to be pretty awesome.
[264:28.40]What am I supposed to do?
[264:29.24]Ammo
[265:09.45]There's a monster right there.
[265:19.47]I have fully loaded ammo.
[265:31.08]What was the point of coming in?
[265:47.68]Boothcam top right.
[265:51.79]Um...
[266:08.89]what am I missing here find the emergency radio code he should be on the front deck okay get out of the fucking way you've got to find that code
[266:39.02]It's burning.
[266:41.30]How do I get to the front of the deck?
[267:12.07]How do I get to the front deck?
[267:19.73]Can I go in a door that I didn't see before?
[267:34.64]It's too quiet now.
[267:38.07]Guys, help me out here.
[267:39.01]I don't understand what this game wants me to do.
[267:42.31]It's right here.
[267:44.03]That door.
[267:45.95]I can't go into this door.
[267:52.27]Go left off to the side?
[267:59.09]What the fuck is this?
[268:00.13]I did it on purpose, but I had to see.
[268:13.95]I had to do it though.
[268:14.64]You know I had to.
[268:18.78]Now I know where to go.
[268:27.85]How come Hanson gets all the fun?
[268:30.31]Because he's prettier than you are, DeSantos.
[268:32.58]Now cut the chatter.
[268:34.56]This place is creeping me out.
[268:36.44]Where is everyone?
[268:38.26]Steady, Freedman.
[268:39.56]Remember, I've got that extraction code in case things get hairy.
[268:43.30]Morning Party, this is the Ravenswood.
[268:45.84]The seas are too rough.
[268:47.01]We're gonna have to head back.
[268:48.09]You're on your own, people.
[268:50.39]You heard the man.
[268:51.17]Keep it tight.
[268:51.83]You're welcome.
[268:52.57]Did you hear that?
[269:05.00]Get up there!
[269:05.46]Do I actually have to fall and... And shimmy?
[269:20.59]I went in a fucking circle!
[269:22.23]You guys told me to do a go here!
[269:24.81]Never mind, that's where you started.
[269:26.43]What do you mean, never mind?
[269:28.21]What do you mean, never mind?
[269:29.49]Everybody told me to go over there!
[269:32.88]Everyone said, go, go, oh, yeah, no, no, no.
[269:35.04]Uh-uh, you ain't gonna do the troll face and tell me, no, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.
[269:39.33]You all got that wrong, and so did I. You all got that completely wrong.
[269:44.03]All of you did.
[269:51.10]Other side?
[270:04.89]He walked past the stairs.
[270:10.23]Yeah, we haven't played this game.
[270:12.66]You guys all told me to go this way.
[270:14.46]Dude, if the front of this fucking boat is this hard to find, I'm sorry, but this is stupid.
[270:30.73]You did it again?
[270:31.89]The other side of the... Do you want me to link you a walkthrough?
[270:36.34]The left staircase.
[270:38.86]This staircase right here.
[270:40.60]This one right here.
[270:43.36]This one right here.
[270:46.60]Okay, I've been up here before.
[270:48.07]I was already up here.
[270:50.89]It just takes you to the other side of the boat.
[270:58.56]What are you talking about?
[271:05.53]Just go to customer service.
[271:07.75]There's a door.
[271:12.05]Why are you yelling?
[271:12.89]Because it's really loud in my ears and I have to talk really loud to hear myself.
[271:16.91]That door?
[271:18.48]Dude, this door is just a scary jump scare for five seconds.
[271:33.97]Nobody knows where I'm supposed to go.
[271:35.71]This is not the front deck.
[272:01.54]Try the opposite side of the boat from where you started?
[272:04.11]Maybe.
[272:04.53]I don't know.
[272:05.25]I don't understand what it wants me to do.
[272:10.83]I've been every single place.
[272:13.55]Go to the poop deck.
[272:14.85]That was actually kind of funny.
[272:21.34]Go to the tip of the boat.
[272:23.50]Believe it or not, you're not in the right area now.
[272:25.46]Go find the area you're supposed to be in.
[272:27.68]Over here?
[272:28.64]Have I looked back here?
[272:52.60]How do I reload?
[273:00.83]I'm sorry, that was impossible.
[273:03.57]I had to accidentally touch every piece of this boat.
[273:07.79]I better read the inscriptions so that I don't get lost.
[273:10.89]Let's see how much of my Russian I still remember.
[273:14.01]This door is locked by an electrical system.
[273:18.05]Damn thing's locked from the other side.
[273:21.67]Maybe I can shoot this thing.
[273:28.70]It's unlocked.
[273:33.26]Get off!
[273:34.90]What the fuck?
[273:36.52]Stop!
[273:37.18]Stop it!
[273:37.98]Stop!
[273:38.98]Stop!
[273:40.06]Stop!
[273:45.20]Why are you touching it?
[273:48.25]What are you doing?
[273:50.69]Hey.
[274:32.32]Hey.
[274:34.20]Alright.
[274:34.96]Now, I don't remember even where to go from there.
[274:37.56]I can't believe you can get electrocuted by the thing.
[274:51.49]Hey.
[274:57.31]Yeah, yeah, I know.
[274:58.51]I know.
[274:58.93]Steady.
[274:59.31]Watch out.
[274:59.85]You can use ammo.
[275:00.67]Put it in your gun.
[275:01.43]Yep.
[275:01.69]Sounds great.
[275:02.77]Excellent.
[275:03.48]I can't wait.
[275:05.81]Mm-hmm.
[275:06.71]I'm not gonna shoot anything.
[275:08.57]Why would there be this much ammo around here if there's no enemies?
[275:11.63]It's over here, straight ahead.
[275:13.55]The one tiny, teeny, tiny, itsy-bitsy, not even the width of a human being.
[275:21.72]This is what I needed to see.
[275:23.66]Look, it's not even the width of a human being, and this is what I have to go down.
[275:27.90]I'm falling back.
[275:30.14]Reform on my position.
[275:30.72]I repeat, reform here.
[275:32.74]Lieutenant Lansing, come in, come in.
[275:36.29]Who's this?
[275:37.35]Who's this guy?
[275:43.94]What happened?
[275:56.67]These Russian boats aren't exactly built the same way ours are.
[275:59.97]I better read the inscription.
[276:03.41]Why did that happen?
[276:08.90]He got killed by the waves last time because you took so long.
[276:11.92]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[276:14.52]No!
[276:14.64]How do I... How do I do this correctly?
[276:57.48]What are you doing?
[277:13.70]Shut up!
[277:14.82]Shut up!
[277:15.32]Shut up!
[277:15.66]Save?
[277:22.98]How do you save?
[277:44.22]And now what?
[277:46.12]Okay, he should be in the front.
[277:47.56]I gotta get to the front deck.
[278:06.69]The tank control games are stupid.
[278:11.03]They're dumb.
[278:12.24]They're dumb.
[278:14.26]I have to say it to you.
[278:19.01]That was... That took me way too long to... Oh, okay, good.
[278:48.26]You're a weenie.
[278:52.84]I'm okay with that.
[278:58.21]Yay.
[278:58.69]Hey, hey.
[279:20.77]What are you doing?
[279:21.57]How am I supposed to see?
[280:00.32]Where's the door?
[280:06.15]It's a scary game now.
[280:08.41]You're being too quiet.
[280:09.63]I'm trying to focus.
[280:14.01]Main deck.
[280:15.81]Great.
[280:16.33]It's locked.
[280:19.17]This door ain't opening.
[280:53.53]Save a note about the armory.
[281:02.27]Smoking is forbidden.
[281:03.21]Okay.
[281:04.29]So this is where this is deaf.
[281:05.52]That was Resident Evil typewriter music, right?
[281:19.12]Really?
[281:24.87]We need some comedic relief.
[281:27.11]Can you put in a bit more effort, please?
[281:42.49]Electrical boxes.
[281:43.33]Yeah, I know.
[281:44.65]Trust me.
[281:45.97]I wish I had that info like 20 minutes ago when I got electrocuted to death.
[282:05.72]Great.
[282:06.18]It's locked.
[282:13.92]Medikit?
[282:15.48]I better watch how much I'm using.
[282:16.86]I ain't got an unlimited supply.
[282:18.46]Why would I even take that?
[282:19.78]I thought it was a health pack I could store in my inventory.
[282:24.60]That's not what that was.
[282:25.42]I had full health.
[282:29.36]Have you been... I'm not going to read that.
[282:33.47]Locked.
[282:45.16]page from the wait I ain't reading all that never mind
[282:58.16]I wish I could just turn on... I wish there was a thing I could turn on like a caveman filter.
[283:01.16]Where it would just be like... This is like two or three pages of info.
[283:07.12]And I can press like... I can hold start, select, and press both the trigger buttons.
[283:11.72]And it'll just give me one sentence.
[283:14.37]Like... Electrical box.
[283:16.69]Danger.
[283:18.17]Touch do not.
[283:20.01]Key.
[283:20.93]Upper hallway.
[283:23.05]Like... Hallway 1B.
[283:25.41]Right, I just wish it would be... I would pay extra for that.
[283:35.28]Me die from electrical box.
[283:37.82]Me leave key.
[283:39.14]Hallway 1.
[283:40.42]Door 1B.
[283:40.76]Thank you.
[283:42.50]Thank you so much.
[283:43.45]What kind of weird ship is this?
[283:45.11]I'm gonna need an electronic key to open this sucker up.
[283:54.55]you need a journalist mode that's not eve come on no I just want like a condensed mode
[284:40.64]Okay, well, good thing I already killed the zombie.
[284:51.22]I knew it was gonna happen!
[284:57.65]Thank God I got the key.
[284:59.21]Can I do something about this?
[285:00.95]What do I do about this?
[285:12.43]OK, OK, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[285:15.51]I need a handle for this door.
[285:20.83]I have the upper deck key.
[285:23.11]Let me see if these doors, if any of these doors work after the next electrocution.
[285:35.58]The damn thing stuck.
[285:40.18]There's too much water pressure.
[285:41.50]I can't... Upper deck.
[286:01.40]It's unlocked.
[286:07.93]I need a save point right now.
[286:11.19]I need a save point right now.
[286:16.06]This is really bad.
[286:50.37]Nothing even in here.
[286:54.51]Really?
[287:11.67]This stupid idea.
[287:14.59]Shut up idiot.
[287:47.38]Alright, please raise your hand if in five minutes you could get back to the front of the boat where we were.
[287:55.85]Good luck, because I have no.
[287:57.53]I have no idea.
[288:17.22]Why did he do that?
[288:20.94]Dude, just if you just waited five seconds.
[288:28.59]OK.
[288:31.19]Should I check this door?
[288:33.87]What was the point of that?
[288:38.74]Front deck.
[288:40.62]I think I made it to the front deck.
[288:43.34]It must be downstairs.
[289:07.11]All burned.
[289:31.16]Must be downstairs where?
[290:03.85]Page from the diary.
[290:14.15]Poison hurt.
[290:16.01]Infection.
[290:18.43]Antidote needed.
[290:19.11]Appreciate it.
[290:40.22]The gun sounds sound like they're coming from a different room in the house.
[290:45.14]So it sounds like that.
[291:03.45]The damn thing stuck.
[291:07.69]Lansing.
[291:11.22]Oh man, I'll give it to him though.
[291:12.76]This is pretty good.
[291:20.44]This isn't this ain't bad.
[291:26.03]At least I found the code.
[291:29.15]This isn't.
[291:33.67]Find the radio room.
[291:34.73]Good luck.
[291:35.25]I have no idea.
[291:37.70]Actually, I'm probably going to actually ask somebody to look that up.
[291:40.10]Because how am I ever going to find that from here?
[291:57.09]Help me!
[292:01.21]Holy...
[292:43.08]Yeah, I'd like to save.
[292:53.67]Weird pop-up, but I'll... Who am I... Who's playing as who?
[293:03.52]Oh, it's me!
[293:04.26]Wait...
[293:33.65]Where's the radio room?
[293:35.81]Wait, the radio room is the first room at the very beginning of the entire thing, isn't it?
[293:41.23]That's the radio room, isn't it?
[293:45.33]That would be correct.
[293:58.57]Yeah, I would imagine, right?
[293:59.57]It has to be.
[294:25.36]This game's... I don't... I don't hate it.
[294:31.54]It's fun.
[294:33.86]It's fun enough.
[294:34.40]I just wanted to see if those things actually explode.
[294:51.20]Okay, this is where we have fun trying to go all the way back to the very beginning of the game.
[295:02.05]To make the ship roll realistically, the developers had to write a completely new program, dubbed the Dark Wave Editor, to allow them to control movement on both vertical and horizontal axes.
[295:13.09]They also used real physics to simulate the movement patterns of inanimate objects on the ship.
[295:17.09]Due to the random nature created by this, the player character required nine times the amount of animations usually seen in third-person games.
[295:24.47]Ultimately, the game contained more than 900...
[295:29.18]What else?
[295:30.20]It's cool.
[295:33.30]This is a good game.
[295:34.68]Look, this came out.
[295:35.40]I don't even know when, but this is cool.
[295:40.01]Just look at the swing back and forth.
[295:46.03]That's really cool.
[295:53.64]Hey, we've played at least one other game in this genre of survival horror like this.
[296:01.96]This is the only one that I wouldn't eat.
[296:03.50]What's that supposed to mean?
[296:20.97]I don't know.
[296:22.98]It's the only one I would keep around.
[296:27.54]I would eat the other ones, but no, I wouldn't eat the other ones.
[296:31.53]It's just the only ones I wouldn't break.
[296:38.89]I don't know.
[296:40.05]I thought eat was a different, was like a cooler way to say like throw away or like break.
[296:57.28]No, we got to know what that is.
[297:10.85]Damn.
[297:14.51]What's this?
[297:15.25]It looks like this will do the job.
[297:17.23]Hand wheel for the fish hold door.
[297:23.56]Cool.
[297:32.27]Dude, you're not beating the you're not human allegations.
[297:45.48]Is he dead?
[297:49.49]What the fuck?
[298:09.06]I have to shoot their heads.
[298:13.74]See, I told you.
[298:14.58]I'm out of ammo.
[298:22.77]Thank God.
[298:31.52]It's actually scary.
[298:35.01]Where do I go from here?
[298:35.77]I got, I got, we can turn around.
[298:38.22]I can't.
[298:38.94]Alright.
[298:48.10]Well, sorry.
[298:53.30]How do I get out of here?
[299:17.56]Holy shit.
[299:20.12]You gotta find the fish stick door.
[299:23.90]You're so greasy.
[299:28.92]Sound is so desynced.
[299:30.67]Is it?
[299:34.43]Is it?
[299:35.43]Did nobody tell me?
[299:36.83]For like the last five hours?
[299:41.87]No, it's not.
[299:42.37]Not at all.
[299:45.42]It's fine.
[299:45.84]It's fine.
[299:46.27]No, it's fine.
[299:46.91]It's fine.
[299:48.31]Sounds fine.
[299:50.53]It's a stream.
[299:51.63]Oh.
[299:53.15]I mean, yeah, I'm going to get like a little moisture all over my face.
[299:57.26]I'm sitting here.
[299:58.18]I've got an Xbox sauna in the room.
[300:00.42]I've got a GTX 3090 going at firing at all cylinders.
[300:08.09]I've got three monitors blaring light into my face.
[300:12.05]I have a ring light up here blaring sauna-like heat into my face.
[300:19.39]You have a 3090?
[300:20.62]Yes, I do.
[300:20.92]Alright, how do I get out of here?
[300:37.32]Oh, I remember this.
[300:39.66]There's this part and then I'm close.
[300:43.94]I'm really close.
[300:51.97]Privileged streamer.
[300:53.69]Oh, do not be mistaken.
[300:55.03]I am a moron.
[300:56.85]It sucked.
[300:58.05]I didn't want this.
[300:59.51]I did not want this card.
[301:02.90]I paid such a stupid price for this because there were no graphics cards.
[301:09.09]There were none.
[301:11.05]Do you remember a few years ago, two years ago or so, when it was like there were bots just waiting and anytime like a 3080 or like a 3070 came up, just there was whole websites, there were whole discords and bots dedicated to scooping them up at the second they were available.
[301:26.47]I found $130.90 for a stupid price, and I was like, I hate myself for doing this.
[301:32.25]But I waited, like, probably four, five, six months.
[301:34.81]I was like, what the fuck, man?
[301:36.76]I want a new computer, and I want a new graphics card.
[301:41.92]I really didn't want to do it.
[301:42.84]You look like a wax model.
[301:56.69]I wanted a 3090.
[301:57.31]No, a 3080.
[301:58.05]But it just was never going to happen.
[302:01.39]And I didn't want a 3070 because I got streaming.
[302:04.11]It was like I want to stream and be able to play games of good quality and stream it and stuff.
[302:07.27]So I was like, whatever.
[302:07.93]OK, where do I need to go from here?
[302:14.44]It's back this way, isn't it?
[302:16.62]Yeah.
[302:18.46]And then where?
[302:19.80]Here?
[302:26.07]Where's the way out of here?
[302:30.93]Is it this one?
[302:36.24]No.
[302:36.48]Okay.
[302:36.62]This is the armory.
[302:43.53]What was the price?
[302:45.11]I don't remember, but it was, it had, it was definitely more than a couple thousand dollars.
[302:52.32]It was like, this is just a stomachache thinking about it.
[302:58.61]It was a stomachache.
[302:59.41]I got a stomachache looking at it.
[303:05.33]It was so bad.
[303:06.27]I ended up getting a 3060 Ti for two and a half times retail price.
[303:22.09]Can somebody help me here?
[303:25.50]What brand of 3090?
[303:26.32]I actually... EVGA?
[303:32.24]Maybe?
[303:34.40]Can somebody help me?
[303:35.82]Go down the stairs?
[303:36.78]Thank you.
[303:52.37]This is where the electricity is down here.
[303:58.10]Oh, shit.
[303:59.16]Okay.
[304:02.36]They stopped making NVIDIA cards?
[304:08.73]Yeah, I mean, I... Who even makes good graphics cards now?
[304:16.07]You don't play games that require 3090.
[304:19.01]Streaming requires a very powerful machine, especially if you're going to do the GPU rendering.
[304:36.94]Swag.
[304:48.63]Oh.
[304:54.39]Oh.
[305:00.25]Boy, son of a bitch.
[305:01.95]You still alive?
[305:47.03]Is that it?
[305:51.48]Okay, that's it.
[306:01.49]Um... Yeah, I don't... I typically do graphics cards every... I want to say...
[306:12.29]I usually wait at least two or three generations.
[306:15.53]So if I have a 3090, I'm probably going to wait for at least like the 6000, like the 6090, whatever, a 6080.
[306:23.73]I usually wait two or three generations.
[306:30.90]Before the 3090, I had a 1080.
[306:32.68]So what's that?
[306:33.74]Two generations?
[306:35.44]Three, maybe?
[306:36.94]Took a while for the 30 series to come out, didn't it?
[306:41.08]What am I missing in here?
[306:44.20]Splash?
[306:48.58]And let me be really honest, that 1080 lasted an incredibly long time.
[306:55.81]Do I have permission to swag out?
[306:57.23]Yeah.
[307:03.59]You don't have to wait.
[307:07.11]I don't want to just buy shit just to buy it.
[307:12.22]I'd rather just get what I pay for and use it and get the best out of it whenever I can.
[307:15.76]I don't buy a new phone every year.
[307:21.39]That's kind of... I feel like that's an overkill.
[307:26.97]I buy a new graphics card when I buy a new phone.
[307:33.48]They happen at the same time.
[307:45.19]So what am I... Is it an item I didn't get?
[307:47.21]Who buys a phone every year?
[307:55.96]Didn't I get a fish key?
[307:57.48]How come I can't use it here?
[308:08.39]You got the radio room key.
[308:09.57]I got a fish thing, though.
[308:10.73]It said, like, the fish thing.
[308:14.86]Didn't it say that?
[308:26.56]No.
[308:27.04]So what's the point of coming down here?
[308:28.04]Just to get scared and then leave?
[308:33.36]Yeah, I don't need new phones.
[308:34.82]I like the stuff that I have.
[308:36.18]I don't know, because here's another thing, right?
[308:39.48]If you buy a phone every single year, you're just going to have a bunch of fucking phones.
[308:44.96]And then what?
[308:45.80]I mean, you can try to use one of those recycling programs?
[308:49.78]I don't know.
[308:51.98]I just don't want it.
[308:52.64]I mean, you could just turn them in.
[308:56.34]But I don't want a new... Because when you get a new phone, think about what happens when you get a new phone.
[309:05.98]When you get a new phone, it's like your whole life has to reset.
[309:10.35]Like, you gotta get all the applications, and you gotta get all your contacts, and you gotta, hey, you gotta do this, you gotta do that, you gotta update this.
[309:17.97]No, I don't want, I don't, no.
[309:20.05]What I have works, and it's fine.
[309:21.51]It's up to date.
[309:22.07]Alright, where do I go from here?
[309:33.15]Any help?
[309:44.16]transfer shit, but I don't want a new phone every year.
[309:47.18]They don't change very much.
[309:50.08]I don't need new shit.
[309:52.15]I, okay.
[309:52.67]If you have like an iPhone, if you have an iPhone, let's just say like an iPhone 12 right now, right now, like you have an iPhone 12 or an iPhone like 13, what is going to happen next year where you, you need to upgrade it?
[310:09.22]When you go on Twitter, when you're on Snapchat, like the filter loads .2 seconds faster.
[310:14.84]What's the need for it?
[310:16.96]USB-C.
[310:20.46]I'm telling you, two or three years, you'll get some new, there'll be some new development to make it worthwhile.
[310:27.69]You're just getting, it's like buying Madden every year.
[310:31.65]It's like Madden 2021, 22, 23, 24.
[310:34.93]You know, I just buy Madden 20 fucking 20 and I just update the rosters.
[310:42.45]I don't need a new Madden.
[310:46.81]Or I go into the character creator and I just make the motherfuckers myself.
[310:51.30]You know how long I played MVP baseball like 2004, 2005?
[310:55.56]And I just made every single fucking Major League Baseball player.
[310:59.96]I didn't care.
[311:00.46]You can just replace them.
[311:03.91]Takes a little bit of work, but it's worth it.
[311:05.29]Is this an iPhone rant?
[311:09.65]No, no, I like phones.
[311:12.57]Oh, wow, the Galaxy.
[311:13.85]Like, super cool.
[311:14.71]Cool, that's fucking cool.
[311:16.09]But you don't need one every single year.
[311:19.85]You know, you get a Galaxy phone?
[311:24.21]Sick.
[311:24.79]That's fucking awesome.
[311:27.42]You're gonna get the Galaxy phone seven months later?
[311:31.03]You already have the Galaxy 2.
[311:32.35]You need the Galaxy 3.
[311:33.23]You're already on a different goddamn... You're in a goddamn nebula at that point.
[311:36.92]You need another galaxy?
[311:38.84]It's the... You already have the 2.
[311:39.98]You don't need the 3.
[311:41.52]What does the 3 give you?
[311:42.24]The 2 that you're still... You're in outer space already.
[311:48.60]Somebody tell me where to go.
[311:55.07]Somebody tell me where the door to open...
[312:01.07]Go down the hall, electrocution door is on the right.
[312:08.15]I can hear it.
[312:16.96]Where is it?
[312:17.36]Am I going the right way?
[312:27.56]Yeah, the crew quarters.
[312:29.14]Just use a guide.
[312:34.02]This is the right way?
[312:34.90]Straight through here, right?
[312:36.50]Straight through here.
[312:45.17]Yeah.
[312:45.73]No, it's not right.
[312:48.95]I hate backtracking.
[312:49.99]I just want to go forward.
[312:52.42]Or I need a map.
[312:53.38]If there's backtracking, I need a map.
[312:56.92]You're cheating already.
[313:04.13]I feel like I'm so close, but so far away.
[313:09.91]This... They just spawn randomly.
[313:11.83]It's randomly generated spawns.
[313:15.33]I just did not expect anybody to be right here.
[313:22.56]Next game?
[313:23.40]Alright, but... I need to at least complete this part.
[313:28.10]Draw your own map.
[313:28.98]I can't.
[313:32.30]From where I'm standing right now, where do I go?
[313:35.24]Just help me.
[313:36.78]I know you guys can help me.
[313:46.00]Do whatever you want.
[313:47.50]Up.
[313:49.38]That was like a Twitch staff member.
[313:51.40]So I'm going to listen to that.
[313:53.09]Back and up.
[314:01.48]How do I go up?
[314:10.10]Just be yourself, little guy.
[314:11.64]How do I get out of here?
[314:19.33]Just help.
[314:20.33]I'm going to...
[314:24.59]I'm playing Obi-Wan.
[314:26.23]I'm playing Obi-Wan.
[314:26.85]This is why I need a map.
[314:27.55]Just give me a map.
[314:29.01]Just give me a map.
[314:29.99]Backtracking sucks without a map.
[314:39.19]Pog, I made it up.
[314:41.73]Literally nobody's played this game.
[314:43.29]We can't help you.
[314:47.10]Fuck, I just want to complete this one mission so I can say I got through chapter one of Cold Fear at least.
[314:53.58]How do I get out of here?
[315:01.86]No!
[315:02.64]It's one of these seven or eight doors.
[315:05.37]I have to take this disk out.
[315:13.87]It's not this door.
[315:17.87]Please, did you try the far left door?
[315:19.43]This one...
[315:33.13]It's right here.
[315:34.41]It's right here.
[315:35.37]It's... I remember we walked over here and I was like, oh, cool.
[315:37.39]What the fuck?
[315:38.95]Other left.
[315:40.87]It's right here.
[315:42.33]Don't give up.
[315:43.12]My cat would be disappointed in you.
[315:45.44]Fuck.
[315:47.20]It's not that one.
[315:47.94]It's not that one.
[315:50.06]It's not this one.
[315:50.78]This one doesn't open.
[315:51.48]It's not this one.
[315:54.22]So what door is it to get out of here?
[315:57.54]Stop yelling at people.
[316:06.58]It's that one!
[316:07.58]Okay.
[316:19.09]I didn't have any guns.
[316:19.89]Okay, I'm almost there.
[316:30.03]And then after I turn this in, I'm gonna play Obi-Wan.
[316:46.80]Do we have a break?
[316:47.78]Uh, you'll have a break in the time it takes me to, um, take Obi-Wan out of its case and put it into the disk tray.
[316:54.97]It's about five minutes.
[316:57.53]Why am I going back down?
[316:58.47]What the fuck is happening now?
[317:16.13]Why would it take you five minutes?
[317:23.12]Time it.
[317:48.87]You don't have a fucking head!
[317:50.07]You can't do that!
[317:50.91]I've been really on edge tonight.
[318:28.02]I can't wait till we get to hear it.
[318:38.99]Bravo seven Niner.
[318:40.07]Can you hear me?
[318:41.29]Who am I speaking to?
[318:42.67]Where's Lansing?
[318:43.97]Lansing's dead.
[318:44.79]This is Hanson.
[318:45.77]Everyone else is down.
[318:47.77]Bloody hell.
[318:49.65]Then I guess we're stuck with each other, Hanson, but you're not the only survivor.
[318:53.81]There's still a very dangerous man loose on that ship.
[318:56.31]Colonel Dimitri Yusupov.
[318:58.53]He needs to answer a few questions.
[319:00.79]Round him up, and then we'll get you out of there.
[319:03.47]Who's we?
[319:05.37]I'm CIA Special Agent Bennett, Mr. Hanson.
[319:09.05]Patch this frequency through your headset.
[319:11.14]You might need my help.
[319:12.54]Bennett, out.
[319:15.08]Great.
[319:16.00]Just great.
[319:19.14]Okay.
[319:21.18]Find that person.
[319:25.31]Got it.
[319:26.72]So where's this guy I'm looking for?
[319:28.52]We're deckhouse.
[319:29.86]We got a fast satellite look through the cloud cover and pinpointed him.
[319:33.21]Must be nice.
[319:34.31]I'm on my way.
[319:34.89]Cool.
[319:41.74]Why did they just... Wait, where am I?
[319:50.27]Alright, that was fun.
[319:51.49]That was Cold Fear.
[319:52.72]It is apparently January 15th, 2001.
[319:56.60]And it's somehow... This clock is wrong, but not by very much, which is weird.
[320:06.48]It's 2001.
[320:11.85]I'm not alive yet.
[320:20.85]Oh, Pog, I'm not even alive yet.
[320:23.03]Alright, that was fun.
[320:30.13]It's time for Obi-Wan.
[320:31.91]I would rate this one, I'd give this like a B+.
[320:35.05]On the tier list, it's like a B. I think that was some fun.
[320:38.87]That was great.
[320:40.59]Okay, so how long does it take to put a disk in and to load it up?
[320:43.45]Here we go.
[320:43.75]You ready?
[320:45.01]Start timing right now.
[320:50.96]Opening tray.
[320:56.20]Grabbing Obi-Wan.
[320:57.70]Opening Obi-Wan.
[320:59.84]Taking Obi-Wan out of the... If that was Bionicle, I am going to be furious with you.
[321:10.76]It wasn't.
[321:11.06]Okay, remove about 15 seconds because of that.
[321:22.64]Obi-Wan going in.
[321:23.34]Something wrong.
[321:31.81]Obi-Wan going in.
[321:32.59]Okay.
[321:39.51]Very cool.
[321:45.76]Opening it.
[321:49.48]It's not ready yet.
[321:52.99]It's not ready yet.
[321:55.31]It's been like a minute.
[321:56.45]No, it hasn't.
[321:58.16]We're not ready yet.
[321:58.70]That was cute.
[322:20.01]It's been over a minute.
[322:20.83]It's when I'm okay.
[322:23.53]Now, how long has it been since I did that?
[322:26.71]Two, three minutes?
[322:42.92]Jedi one.
[322:59.32]Is there Jerma noises?
[323:00.64]What do you mean?
[323:05.95]No, they're not.
[323:08.59]How about, um...
[323:24.26]I'm so bad at making real names.
[323:29.29]Darth?
[323:33.61]I thought Darth Vader Jr.
[323:35.55]I hate it.
[323:40.78]Wait, aren't I playing as Obi-Wan?
[323:46.76]Why would I need... Why wouldn't I just be Obi-Wan?
[323:53.64]This doesn't matter.
[324:01.15]Oh, that's lame.
[324:03.63]Alright, here we go.
[324:38.37]Real FMV cutscene?
[324:41.97]Are we gonna get a boop?
[324:44.11]Yes, we are.
[324:44.73]Obi-Wan.
[325:05.82]For thousands of years.
[325:07.78]The Jedi Knights have served the Republic as defenders of peace and justice... A little bit faster on the prompter, please.
[325:17.16]The galaxy.
[325:21.22]Young Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi, who studies to become a full-fledged Jedi Knight, must prove himself to his master Qui-Gon Jinn and the Jedi Council.
[325:38.95]As part of this ongoing training, Obi-Wan is commissioned by Mace Windu to investigate the rise of a dangerous new threat in the lower levels of Purusat.
[326:02.69]Hover over that X. Hover over that X. I know I saw you do it.
[326:06.65]You didn't click it though.
[326:07.81]Some of you did.
[326:11.89]Some of you were just like, I want to see this stupid fucking Star Wars game, but I wish you would stop talking.
[326:17.86]I got you, don't worry.
[326:20.88]Everything has been quiet, Master.
[326:22.72]Nothing unusual to report.
[326:24.36]Are you sure my presence here is necessary?
[326:28.73]The Jedi must be patient, young Padawan.
[326:31.49]All will present itself in good time.
[326:33.91]You may return to the Jedi Temple, but be careful.
[326:37.07]The hour is late and the lower sectors are not always safe during the evening.
[326:41.40]Yes, Master.
[326:42.36]There is an Elkar transport station nearby.
[326:44.48]No.
[326:44.90]No more Jedi cheeky werewolf.
[326:47.06]Why are you holding him?
[326:49.84]What?
[326:51.54]I thought... Aren't we like Batman?
[326:53.26]We don't use the powers unless it's necessary?
[326:56.26]What?
[326:57.22]You are...
[327:00.33]Why am I doing this?
[327:02.63]He's screaming help.
[327:09.28]That guy's got a golf club.
[327:21.78]Why would you even come over here?
[327:47.66]What's the mission?
[327:58.93]What am I doing?
[328:02.09]What is he doing?
[328:03.45]Wait, why can you do this?
[328:06.07]Why can I do this?
[328:07.93]I missed everything.
[328:08.93]It was just like, uh, Obi-Wan, go over this way.
[328:13.02]That's all I heard.
[328:13.68]What?
[328:18.23]I only have four attempts remaining.
[328:20.21]I don't know what just happened.
[328:32.99]You're supposed to be the good guy.
[328:34.37]Well, what happened?
[328:35.25]We need to see that again.
[328:37.09]I need to fully focus on what's happening.
[328:41.46]Okay.
[328:45.62]Look out!
[328:46.08]Okay, so what if I just don't...
[328:53.86]Okay, that's enough.
[329:06.31]I didn't want to kill that guy.
[329:07.61]I think I was doing the right thing.
[329:10.81]I just jumped.
[329:30.77]This game is fucking pretty good.
[329:32.75]This game is good.
[329:41.63]I'm back to defend the order.
[330:09.99]You ever see people do that shit?
[330:12.03]I've seen videos of it's like oh look at somebody doing back handsprings this many Don't you you know talk about like during like a musical they'll just kind of go across the screen It's like doesn't that make you feel sick?
[330:28.26]I would feel so awful after
[330:33.63]You have to, you can only, backflip only run.
[330:37.03]Fine.
[330:47.10]You wouldn't believe how hard it is to actually get that done.
[330:49.04]Come here!
[331:07.38]Who needs help?
[331:07.84]Dun-dun-dun-dun!
[331:09.16]Is it safe to go down here?
[331:48.07]Boss fight.
[331:54.85]Front flip Andy.
[331:55.77]Over here.
[331:56.81]What?
[332:10.96]Take this.
[332:11.52]Take this?
[332:11.90]Did I get it?
[332:12.38]Hello.
[332:12.50]Hello, hello, hello.
[332:13.00]Hello.
[332:45.53]Why can you do that?
[332:48.21]Hello?
[332:49.39]This used to be such a nice neighborhood.
[332:50.97]I'm not sure.
[332:51.73]Hello?
[332:52.65]Hello?
[332:52.97]I'm not sure.
[332:57.28]Guys, I gotta be honest.
[332:58.02]I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing right now.
[333:01.12]Elcor transport to upper sector transfer.
[333:03.70]New objective.
[333:04.32]Clear the obstruction that is blocking the transport.
[333:07.26]Are you a bad guy?
[333:07.88]I'm not sure.
[333:39.30]How do I do Jedi moves?
[333:42.14]Like that.
[333:44.62]Wait, hold on.
[333:45.30]I can pick that up?
[333:50.86]Holy shit, alright.
[333:51.66]What's going on here?
[333:52.56]Okay, alright.
[333:52.96]Go, go!
[334:09.64]It's not... Wait.
[334:10.08]You have a big health bar.
[334:12.92]That guy sucked.
[334:59.53]okay just needed a little extra time I think the disk was uh spinning we've identified the group that attacked you as the black heath
[335:16.46]According to the authorities, they are a group of wanted criminals who up to this point have been involved in petty crime.
[335:22.00]This sudden escalation in their criminal activity is most concerning.
[335:25.14]I thought that was Yoda talking for a second.
[335:26.40]I was like, what?
[335:27.02]That's Yoda?
[335:27.76]Something more complicated.
[335:30.67]Sinister.
[335:31.89]Then you must prepare yourself, Obi-Wan.
[335:34.01]Let us proceed to the trial arena.
[335:39.25]Yoda looked like a crumpled up piece of paper.
[335:46.86]Sorry, but he did.
[335:55.99]You did well in escaping the lower sector, Padawan.
[335:59.07]Practice your skills here in the arena.
[336:01.25]You still have much to learn.
[336:02.63]Okay.
[336:06.79]Hello, welcome Obi-Wan.
[336:10.79]Hello.
[336:18.22]Wait, the robot was a Sith?
[336:20.66]Why?
[336:21.28]What is this?
[336:29.25]Back off.
[336:30.01]I'm warning you.
[337:00.78]I'm sorry, but do not give anybody in our group a red lightsaber Are you out of your mind?
[337:11.45]Why did you give him a red lightsaber?
[337:13.67]Give him green Red is evil
[337:26.25]I'd be able to handle it though.
[337:29.23]I would have a red lightsaber, but I would be good.
[337:32.07]I could handle it.
[337:34.45]I would have a red lightsaber and I'd be dark and mysterious, but I would still be a good guy.
[337:41.80]That's me.
[337:45.50]I'm at the site where they're holding the informant.
[337:57.53]Well, this is where this playthrough ends.
[337:59.59]Woe is what was with the early 2000s and having games have just hard fail stealth missions.
[338:07.30]Is that what this is?
[338:08.20]I'll cover you.
[338:27.91]Did I lose?
[338:28.65]I guess not.
[338:32.37]What is this?
[338:33.17]What did I do?
[338:53.59]It is.
[338:54.05]It's a fucking hard fail stealth mission and they were obsessed with these back in the early 2000s.
[339:01.22]Why?
[339:02.84]Nobody wanted to do this.
[339:05.12]Hard fail stealth missions are the worst of the worst.
[339:08.12]The worst offender.
[339:18.37]What?
[339:19.81]No, I didn't even get to start.
[339:21.95]No, fuck you.
[339:24.77]You don't get the sound of the alarm.
[339:26.89]Anybody come near this button, you're dead.
[339:30.08]I'm just saying.
[339:40.92]Nobody's pressing this.
[339:57.09]You know what?
[339:57.83]I can break it!
[339:58.33]Fuck that, let's go!
[339:59.23]Okay, I'm fine.
[340:19.38]I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[340:28.82]Just destroy all their alarm system shit and nobody can do anything.
[341:09.56]Okay.
[341:20.11]That's gonna kill me?
[341:22.55]No, it's not.
[341:25.37]Infiltrate the lower levels.
[341:26.65]Alright, I need a lower level.
[341:42.71]What was that?
[341:43.77]Holy shit.
[341:44.71]You got me.
[341:45.55]Did I do it?
[341:57.08]Is there anywhere lower to go?
[341:58.58]Oh.
[342:18.07]Come here.
[342:18.65]More!
[342:19.05]More!
[342:52.66]He's bloodthirsty.
[342:55.90]-2, +2, right next to each other.
[342:57.54]Rare.
[343:11.91]They're really quiet.
[343:40.75]Did I push him even further?
[343:45.71]Wait, this could happen to me too!
[343:57.54]One more lair.
[344:01.62]Do not.
[344:02.74]What kind of lightsaber would you have?
[344:25.53]I would want like two small lightsabers and have them be like Raphael from Ninja Turtles.
[344:31.45]No, I would want a... I want throwing knives made out of lightsaber.
[344:52.73]I would have an ice blue lightsaber.
[344:54.62]Nice!
[344:57.11]Nice, dude.
[345:12.70]Uh, this game's kind of fun, and I'll tell you why.
[345:17.40]Because the right analog is swing.
[345:19.62]Remember that trend back in the early 2000s where every single game had to have movement with the right stick to attack and fight and stuff?
[345:28.40]Actually works kind of well here.
[345:29.28]It's kind of fun.
[345:29.74]That's why I love this as a kid.
[345:34.70]When do I unlock a horse choke?
[346:13.62]Imagine doing this actually stealth.
[346:15.36]This would be such a boring mission.
[346:17.96]It would take so long.
[346:19.10]This is layer five.
[346:21.28]This would be awful.
[346:35.94]How would you even do this stealth?
[346:48.60]That's it?
[346:49.68]That didn't heal.
[346:50.34]That was not even... The health I just gained was just removed, but...
[347:08.92]That's it?
[347:09.60]That's so bad.
[347:10.42]I'm okay.
[347:17.56]Secret.
[347:48.47]There are lightsaber helicopters?
[347:50.24]What?
[347:50.52]Alright, I could... The bar on the bottom right is 100% getting burned in.
[348:10.01]Yup, because it's already there.
[348:13.43]I have like three different games sort of burnt.
[348:17.12]This health and mana, whatever it is, is burnt in right now.
[348:21.96]Thankfully, after the monitor was off for the whole evening, it was fine.
[348:29.21]I'm not concerned about it.
[348:30.33]I'm not worried about it.
[348:42.80]How come they're talking like Lord of the Rings characters?
[348:52.33]How come they don't lose because I didn't save the game?
[349:03.50]You spawned.
[349:04.28]That's absolutely bullshit.
[349:11.81]back off I'm warning you wow
[349:42.83]Where do I start from here before I freak out?
[349:59.92]Where?
[350:01.14]I don't know.
[350:01.58]Where am I?
[350:02.06]Is this bad?
[350:20.35]I'm making it read the disk so hard right now.
[350:53.95]Hey!
[350:54.39]Hey!
[350:54.99]Boys, go!
[351:03.82]What?
[351:11.72]What?
[351:31.82]I just found a secret.
[351:57.05]The game just crashed.
[352:02.41]Oh shit!
[352:04.59]Who's this?
[352:05.04]That was the person I was supposed to save?
[352:22.22]Why were they just staring at me?
[352:27.43]You killed the hostage.
[352:35.87]Why wouldn't you be like, Obi-Wan, over here, save me!
[352:40.97]Alright, I think I've had just about enough.
[352:51.34]Die, scum!
[353:02.24]Something's wrong, by the way.
[353:04.22]Something's wrong.
[353:05.58]We lost contact.
[353:06.92]How did you lose contact?
[353:07.87]Does the guy have an earpiece?
[353:09.45]What are you talking about?
[353:34.38]I can't just- why is there no cutscene?
[354:02.58]Why is there no cutscene?
[354:04.86]Why is there no cutscene?
[354:09.00]Okay, I can't fuck this up again.
[354:12.68]I can't fuck this up like a ninth time.
[354:23.32]Just do it, get it right.
[354:24.96]Alright, I have a plan.
[354:30.78]Why would they shoot him?
[354:31.74]Ugh, whatever.
[354:33.31]Just run.
[354:34.63]And then when I get down to the second level, I'm just going to kill everybody.
[354:40.10]And another thing.

[355:38.67]Where'd he go?
[355:39.69]Why is he not sitting in the middle?
[355:41.96]Where did the guy go?
[355:53.65]You weren't even tied up this whole time?
[356:01.73]excuse me what am I what is this guy saying what are you saying oh don't come near me don't come near me what do I do what do I have to do with this I'm not sure you need to die right now
[356:33.29]Thank you, Obi-Wan.
[356:34.35]I have much to tell you about these stars.
[356:36.01]You speak perfect English?
[356:37.22]Like, very eloquently.
[356:38.16]Let's go.
[356:38.46]What's going on?
[356:39.34]Okay.
[357:05.37]This game is just kind of chaos.
[357:07.80]I kind of love it.
[357:09.90]Man, some real bangers tonight.
[357:12.52]I don't think there was a game that I didn't think was this slow at all.
[357:15.42]These were all bangers, all of them.
[357:17.20]Damn Xbox.
[357:19.08]Xbox, you got some good shit.
[357:24.57]Master, someone has just arrived.
[357:26.83]I can't make out their species, but they must be the arms dealers.
[357:32.94]Uh-oh.
[357:33.14]Uh-oh.
[358:00.47]I can't wait to hear it.
[358:01.33]Here it comes.
[358:02.07]I could do that this whole time?
[358:04.72]Oh, that's scary, isn't it?
[358:45.04]Where do I go from here?
[358:45.68]Kinda hard to hit, aren't I?
[358:48.62]Where am I supposed to go?
[359:13.97]This is not connected to anything, is it?
[359:16.51]Oh.
[359:23.13]Back off.
[359:24.15]I'm warning you.
[359:25.25]Don't let him get away, Harry.
[359:35.80]Come back here.
[360:17.21]don't don't god damn it I'm okay
[361:07.81]These guys are so hard.
[361:13.31]Alright, get me out of here.
[361:42.74]Don't even have to let him do it himself.
[362:20.98]You did the Dark Souls PvP near the ledge thing.
[362:23.71]We've all been there.
[362:25.01]Sucks.
[362:33.21]Well done, young Padawan.
[362:35.07]We've identified these arms dealers as the Jinha.
[362:38.19]They are a group of fierce warriors who have made a business of arms smuggling.
[362:41.79]Perhaps more importantly...
[362:43.36]The weapons they manufacture seem to be able to withstand our lightsabers.
[362:47.30]This may be Kortosis ore, which we know has force-resistant properties.
[362:53.67]But surely the process of synthesizing Kortosis into armor and weapons is far too expensive and sophisticated for the Jinhaal.
[363:01.21]Could others be involved?
[363:02.85]It is well you succeeded in placing a tracker on their ship.
[363:05.73]We are sending Masters Plo Koon and Eeth Koth to investigate.
[363:09.79]We shall soon learn more.
[363:12.47]Now to proceed to the trial arena, Obi-Wan.
[363:14.80]You must be prepared.
[363:17.16]Somebody said that Qui-Gon looks weird.
[363:19.46]Like there's something off about Qui-Gon.
[363:21.48]Yeah, something's off about Qui-Gon's model.
[363:36.21]Another, another Sith Lord robot?
[363:38.11]By any chance?
[363:38.73]Okay.
[363:38.89]Hi.
[363:39.05]So what do you want to teach me?
[363:40.24]Now, okay, that hurt for real.
[363:41.64]That hurt for real.
[363:42.62]I just want to make sure you understand that hurt for real.
[364:03.12]We're not using wooden swords.
[364:04.82]Back off.
[364:06.06]I'm warning you.
[364:39.14]What a lame fight.
[364:55.49]He just killed me.
[364:57.57]You killed Obi-Wan.
[364:59.19]You gonna revive me?
[365:15.60]Use force lightning?
[365:16.76]That's what I would want more than anything.
[365:19.09]I don't want a lightsaber.
[365:19.95]I want to just be able to be like, boom!
[365:24.77]Lightsaber, that's hand-to-hand.
[365:26.35]I don't know.
[365:26.93]Get hurt.
[365:27.87]That was quite an intro.
[365:55.93]You can't be serious.
[366:06.19]Stop jumping.
[366:07.03]What the fuck?
[366:08.85]It's just mapped to A and I press A all the time.
[366:12.57]I'll get it right now.
[366:16.17]Where's force bite?
[366:32.81]Didn't expect that, did you?
[366:35.17]Your little WWE entrance got interrupted, didn't it?
[366:40.05]Back off.
[366:44.92]I'm warning you.
[367:06.64]Stop it's hard Saishi Tim gives no quarter when you defeat him you will be ready You would like to try again padawan.
[367:21.51]Oh
[367:26.49]I'm not a journalist.
[367:29.03]There are tons of very talented game journalists out there.
[367:32.65]A lot of them.
[367:35.50]Tons of them.
[367:36.42]You don't know any.
[367:37.04]What do you know?
[367:37.54]I tried to just kill this guy.
[367:48.51]That was not a sparring move.
[367:51.01]I'm trying to bury this into your head.
[367:53.59]No.
[368:06.60]Back off, I'm warning you!
[368:44.39]Don't be a weirdo.
[368:47.39]Say something.
[368:47.89]I am focused.
[368:50.41]Down on the right stick to parry.
[369:13.90]Does that work?
[369:14.86]Holding left trigger blocks.
[369:27.25]I think that worked.
[369:27.83]Why would they not tell me that?
[369:31.13]They told me this guy was going to teach me shit.
[369:33.69]And he didn't teach me anything.
[369:35.61]He just walked in and started swinging at me.
[369:38.68]In every other video game, it's like, let me show you something.
[369:41.21]When I swing at you, what I want you to do is I want you to dodge to the left and press X, right?
[369:45.80]Like he just walked in here and attacked me.
[370:08.64]The force is indeed strong in you young Obi-wan I get it but beware I
[370:38.14]This is a surprise birthday party.
[370:47.99]This is what they did.
[370:48.97]They got rid of me for a minute.
[370:50.75]So they could set up the surprise birthday party.
[370:53.51]Like, come quick, hurry, back to the chamber.
[370:55.35]And it's gonna be a big birthday cake.
[371:01.54]Somebody said, who the fuck are all these people?
[371:10.06]You must not consume very much Star Wars.
[371:13.55]But I don't know either.
[371:14.35]I know who Luke is.
[371:17.37]I know who Darth Vader is.
[371:19.35]I know who Qui-Gon Jinn is.
[371:21.31]I know who the Ewoks are.
[371:39.27]Where is he going?
[371:41.71]He just walked in a circle!
[372:09.96]You take the lead.
[372:11.94]You take the lead.
[372:12.54]Go.
[372:12.82]I want to see what Master Qui-Gon Jinn can do.
[372:32.12]You're kind of not very good.
[372:58.15]The families are going to be so sad.
[373:07.60]Watch out for snipers.
[373:08.78]Snipers?
[373:09.64]Hurry Obi-Wan.
[373:10.04]Ow!
[373:29.38]Help, help, help, help, help.
[373:32.92]Help, help.
[373:36.32]Help.
[373:36.96]Dad!
[373:38.69]I don't know, you're probably not dad, but where's the... I need some help.
[373:44.21]Where did he go?
[373:49.79]I got sniped out of the air.
[374:00.33]Alright, it might be time to call it for tonight.
[374:05.82]Another one or two attempts.
[374:08.22]No help.
[374:12.68]Can I reflect it back?
[374:25.05]There are animals here.
[374:31.34]That's cool looking.
[374:37.65]Where's Qui-Gon?
[374:42.53]I don't think I can kill them.
[374:49.94]Where's Qui-Gon?
[375:03.79]This looks like a developer area.
[375:19.64]I feel like I'm not supposed to be up here.
[375:36.78]Snipers!
[375:40.48]What?
[375:42.38]Is he in a tree?
[375:49.63]Kill the Jedi!
[376:05.28]Kill the Jedi!
[376:11.84]You've got to be kidding me.
[376:51.87]Cool.
[376:54.67]Wait, did... What happened?
[376:55.69]Did I... Did we get teleported back?
[377:24.97]I don't want to lose Qui-Gon.
[377:32.59]Dude, what are you doing down here?
[377:39.90]Ow, stop.
[377:40.98]Are you Obi-Wan?
[377:54.36]I'm just... I'm just going.
[377:56.70]Ow!
[378:22.25]No, please.
[378:26.39]I'm done.
[378:27.39]I'm done.
[378:27.81]I'm done.
[378:28.37]I'm done.
[378:29.11]This was fun.
[378:29.83]This was a good one.
[378:30.47]This was fun, but I don't want to do this anymore.
[378:32.17]This level sucks.
[378:34.26]This level is just like a big green plane.
[378:37.16]And you just walk forward.
[378:38.36]This is like a thousand G-mod spawned sniper people.
[378:42.96]This mission is... One more.
[378:46.34]Hurry up.
[378:46.66]We have to find that ship.
[379:01.07]Token.
[379:01.65]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[379:10.62]I'm invincible.
[379:16.82]What direction do I go?
[379:18.06]What direction do I go?
[379:19.88]This way?
[379:23.17]That's water.
[379:23.79]I'm dead.
[379:25.81]Did I do it?
[379:26.21]I think I just did it.
[379:28.34]Oh.
[379:56.80]Oh, that works.
[380:10.60]Master, I found the entrance to some kind of large mining complex.
[380:16.42]Undoubtedly a cortosis mine.
[380:18.80]I'll wager there's some kind of manufacturing plant inside.
[380:22.38]See what kind of evidence you could gather down there.
[380:29.17]I'm not sure.
[380:30.05]I'm not sure.
[380:31.41]I'm not sure.
[380:34.41]I'm not sure.
[381:03.01]I'm not sure.
[381:08.12]I'm not sure.
[381:09.54]I'm not sure.
[381:31.33]I'm done, I'll see you later.
[381:37.23]I'm done.
[381:37.53]I'm done.
[381:39.55]End of the stream run?
[381:41.11]Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[382:01.25]One more.
[382:02.81]One more.
[382:03.17]We'll go out last one.
[382:03.91]I'll try to run through it.
[382:06.49]Do another game?
[382:07.86]This is so much fun.
[382:09.58]Don't worry.
[382:10.02]We're doing this again.
[382:12.28]Very soon.
[382:14.70]One last run through.
[382:15.54]Okay.
[382:32.48]How did I fall the second fucking time?
[383:02.85]The second time.
[383:06.91]Alright, that's it.
[383:07.61]That was fun.
[383:10.05]A raid just came in too?
[383:11.15]Well, thanks for the raid.
[383:11.95]You're welcome.
[383:13.85]We are ending right this very moment.
[383:18.55]That was console gaming weekend and there is...
[383:24.25]remember when I said the reason why I was doing this is because I wanted to get through some of the ones that I didn't do years ago like oh I still had like 10 or so 15 games to play right well I added 30 40 50 more so now instead of having 10 or 15 to do left there's like still like 25. I added more we got caught on somebody there was two they were fun
[383:53.92]Hey, you get caught on him.
[383:54.70]That's fine.
[383:57.29]Do a DS stream?
[383:58.27]I probably will.
[384:01.17]Eventually.
[384:01.73]I want to do N64 as well.
[384:05.70]Ratchet and Clank.
[384:07.68]Yeah.
[384:09.80]Uh, we are doing this again.
[384:11.06]I'm just going to make another pile and just move stuff we've already played to another section so I don't accidentally do it again.
[384:20.33]But that was the Xbox.
[384:21.17]That was Xbox Night number one.
[384:23.57]Probably of at least three or four, judging by how much is sitting in front of me here.
[384:30.87]So the next time you will see me live, uh, this is where it's going to get interesting because Ster and I are going to do the Elden Ring co-op this coming weekend.
[384:42.16]I think either the 21st or the 22nd, I think is what we were thinking.
[384:48.32]So that's happening this weekend.
[384:50.27]So we'll probably just come back with the Xbox in a couple of days on Wednesday.
[384:59.16]So we'll do Wednesday Xbox and then maybe Friday Xbox and then whenever Elden Ring happens.
[385:07.19]So I'll see you on Wednesday.
[385:08.07]See you in a couple days.
[385:16.72]I'm just going to keep it all here.
[385:17.56]I'm not going to tear it down or anything.
[385:19.76]We'll just keep going.
[385:24.47]Thanks for hanging out.
[385:25.15]Thanks for watching.
[385:27.01]There.
[385:30.21]It's a ton of fun.
[385:31.47]I love doing this.
[385:36.99]We talked about it last night, but one of the big reasons why it's so much fun to do this is because you can just move on.
[385:43.07]Or I play it for three or four hours.
[385:45.74]You just kind of never know what you're going to get.
[385:53.40]But yeah.
[385:57.15]And then the Elden Ring co-op stuff, I don't know if we're going to do that for more than a couple of days.
[386:03.29]I can't imagine that's going to be something that happens.
[386:08.16]I mean, we're going to do randomizer co-op?
[386:10.42]Is it going to be a mess?
[386:15.36]Love Tweet, thanks for the raid.
[386:17.00]I think there were a couple of raids tonight that I missed.
[386:20.54]I was too in it.
[386:23.13]But if you just came from love tweeze stream, thanks for writing.
[386:29.34]Sorry that we're turning it off immediately after you get here.
[386:32.94]But appreciate it.
[386:42.04]Vinny's playing a Star Wars game right now too.
[386:47.60]What is Vinny doing?
[386:48.34]Let's see.
[386:58.57]Star Wars Dark Forces.
[387:04.17]See if it's as good as Obi-Wan.
[387:05.23]Alright, yeah, we'll raid Vinny.
[387:08.77]We haven't raided anybody in a long time, so let's raid Vinny.
[387:11.65]It's been at least a few weeks.
[387:15.97]At least a couple weeks.
[387:17.42]Go say hello to Vinny.
[387:19.58]Playing Star Wars Dark Forces mod.
[387:28.90]Very cool.
[387:33.01]Give my best.
[387:36.95]And I'll see you later.
[387:38.41]See you Wednesday.
[387:39.47]Good night.
[387:40.03]Goodbye.
[387:41.67]Call your mother.
[387:43.11]See you later.
[388:01.17]I'm not muted.
[388:05.49]Hot Mike.
[388:06.03]See you later.
[388:35.99]you
